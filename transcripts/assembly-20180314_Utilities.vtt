00:33:12.858 --> 00:33:16.394 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION FOR GREATER

00:33:14.259 --> 00:33:17.863 region:rollup2
REGIONAL COLLABORATION AND WE

00:33:16.394 --> 00:33:20.799 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY BECAUSE IT WILL WE

00:33:17.863 --> 00:33:21.466 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IT WILL HELP ADVANCE

00:33:20.799 --> 00:33:23.168 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS.

00:33:21.466 --> 00:33:23.568 region:rollup2
SO MY COLLEAGUE MARK ROUGHLY AND

00:33:23.168 --> 00:33:25.170 region:rollup2
I ARE GOING TO.

00:33:23.568 --> 00:33:26.638 region:rollup2
WALK THROUGH A FAIR AMOUNT OF

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:28.039 region:rollup2
INFORMATION FOR YOU TODAY AND

00:33:26.638 --> 00:33:29.674 region:rollup2
YOU WILL GET TO THE SLIDE DECK

00:33:28.039 --> 00:33:30.842 region:rollup2
WHEN I HANDED OFF TO MARK. BUT I

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:32.944 region:rollup2
WANTED TO MAKE A FEW OPENING

00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:35.213 region:rollup2
REMARKS AND IN SHORT WE'RE HERE

00:33:32.944 --> 00:33:36.514 region:rollup2
TODAY BECAUSE THE REGIONAL GRADE

00:33:35.213 --> 00:33:37.782 region:rollup2
WILL BE GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA.

00:33:36.514 --> 00:33:39.885 region:rollup2
AND TO THAT END WE'RE HERE TO

00:33:37.782 --> 00:33:41.319 region:rollup2
PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE

00:33:39.885 --> 00:33:42.153 region:rollup2
DO THE I SO.

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:43.655 region:rollup2
DISCUSS WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

00:33:42.153 --> 00:33:45.156 region:rollup2
OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCES AND

00:33:43.655 --> 00:33:45.991 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE ALREADY

00:33:45.156 --> 00:33:48.460 region:rollup2
SEEN AND WHERE WE SEE THINGS

00:33:45.991 --> 00:33:49.761 region:rollup2
GOING. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY JUST

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:52.197 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN HOW A REGIONAL

00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:53.298 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION MULTI STATE DIET

00:33:52.197 --> 00:33:54.866 region:rollup2
SO CAN CERTAINLY HELP MEET

00:33:53.298 --> 00:33:56.101 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S ONGOING GREEN

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:57.435 region:rollup2
ENERGY GOALS.

00:33:56.101 --> 00:33:58.403 region:rollup2
AND SO BY WAY OF BACKGROUND I

00:33:57.435 --> 00:34:00.772 region:rollup2
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE

00:33:58.403 --> 00:34:02.941 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT AND I ALSO LEAST

00:34:00.772 --> 00:34:04.309 region:rollup2
DECIDED SO IS A NOT FOR PROFIT

00:34:02.941 --> 00:34:05.076 region:rollup2
ENTITY. WERE PUBLIC BENEFIT

00:34:04.309 --> 00:34:06.578 region:rollup2
CORPORATION.

00:34:05.076 --> 00:34:07.779 region:rollup2
AND WE WORK UNDER THE

00:34:06.578 --> 00:34:09.281 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL

00:34:07.779 --> 00:34:10.849 region:rollup2
ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION.

00:34:09.281 --> 00:34:13.018 region:rollup2
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT WE DO

00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:15.787 region:rollup2
IS WE APPLY NATIONAL RELIABILITY

00:34:13.018 --> 00:34:16.988 region:rollup2
STANDARDS IN OPERATING BUILD IT

00:34:15.787 --> 00:34:18.423 region:rollup2
UP AND SERVING ABOUT EIGHTY

00:34:16.988 --> 00:34:20.091 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE LOAD. HEARING

00:34:18.423 --> 00:34:22.794 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND PROVIDED RELIABLE

00:34:20.091 --> 00:34:23.395 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC SERVICE TO THOSE THOSE

00:34:22.794 --> 00:34:24.229 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS HERE IN THE STATE OF

00:34:23.395 --> 00:34:25.397 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:34:24.229 --> 00:34:27.065 region:rollup2
ONE OF THINGS WE'VE DONE OVER

00:34:25.397 --> 00:34:28.800 region:rollup2
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS

00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:29.834 region:rollup2
IS CALIFORNIA'S MADE GREAT

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.903 region:rollup2
STRIDES IN IMPLEMENTING

00:34:29.834 --> 00:34:33.772 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF RENEWABLE

00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:35.941 region:rollup2
RESOURCES INTO THE SYSTEM. AND

00:34:33.772 --> 00:34:37.175 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME INSURING A LOT

00:34:35.941 --> 00:34:38.610 region:rollup2
RELIABLE ELECTRIC SERVICE TO

00:34:37.175 --> 00:34:40.278 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS.

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:41.913 region:rollup2
WAIT WE'VE DONE THAT IS CAL I SO

00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:43.548 region:rollup2
WORKS WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS WITH

00:34:41.913 --> 00:34:44.916 region:rollup2
A VERY OPEN AND TRANSPARENT

00:34:43.548 --> 00:34:46.184 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS.

00:34:44.916 --> 00:34:48.219 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE

00:34:46.184 --> 00:34:49.888 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED AND DEPLOYED A NUMBER

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:51.523 region:rollup2
OF TECHNOLOGY TOOLS TO HELP US

00:34:49.888 --> 00:34:52.724 region:rollup2
DO THIS.

00:34:51.523 --> 00:34:54.292 region:rollup2
AND FIRST AND FOREMOST WHAT OUR

00:34:52.724 --> 00:34:56.027 region:rollup2
PRIMARY GOAL IS BOUNCING LOADS

00:34:54.292 --> 00:34:57.162 region:rollup2
AND RESOURCES AND MAKING SURE WE

00:34:56.027 --> 00:34:58.530 region:rollup2
CONSERVE THAT THAT CONSUMER LOAD

00:34:57.162 --> 00:34:59.864 region:rollup2
AT ALL HOURS.

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:01.066 region:rollup2
WE ALSO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO

00:34:59.864 --> 00:35:02.801 region:rollup2
THAT THE SAME TIME WE'RE

00:35:01.066 --> 00:35:04.669 region:rollup2
INCREASING THAT RENEWABLES

00:35:02.801 --> 00:35:06.037 region:rollup2
COMING FROM THE STATE'S OUR PS

00:35:04.669 --> 00:35:07.539 region:rollup2
GOALS AND MORE POORLY NOW

00:35:06.037 --> 00:35:09.174 region:rollup2
STARTING TO MEASURE AND QUANTIFY

00:35:07.539 --> 00:35:10.275 region:rollup2
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH GHG

00:35:09.174 --> 00:35:11.743 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS. AS PART OF THOSE

00:35:10.275 --> 00:35:13.078 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS.

00:35:11.743 --> 00:35:14.546 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE CONTINUALLY WORKING TO

00:35:13.078 --> 00:35:16.781 region:rollup2
REFINE THAT AND MOVE THIS

00:35:14.546 --> 00:35:19.084 region:rollup2
FORWARD. BUT REALLY WHAT WE ARE

00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:20.185 region:rollup2
SEEING IS AN ENHANCED CREATED

00:35:19.084 --> 00:35:21.987 region:rollup2
THAT'S IMPROVING RELIABILITY FOR

00:35:20.185 --> 00:35:23.722 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND SOME OF THE

00:35:21.987 --> 00:35:24.356 region:rollup2
WESTERN STATES AS WELL AND

00:35:23.722 --> 00:35:25.156 region:rollup2
YOU'LL HEAR SOME MORE ABOUT THAT

00:35:24.356 --> 00:35:26.992 region:rollup2
FROM US.

00:35:25.156 --> 00:35:28.960 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT RECOGNIZE.

00:35:26.992 --> 00:35:30.862 region:rollup2
THERE IS A MAJOR EVOLUTION

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.931 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IN THE WEST TODAY.

00:35:30.862 --> 00:35:33.965 region:rollup2
PALM WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ISO

00:35:32.931 --> 00:35:35.767 region:rollup2
THERE'S AT LEAST TWO OTHER AYE

00:35:33.965 --> 00:35:37.469 region:rollup2
ESOS THAT ARE NOW LOOKING TO

00:35:35.767 --> 00:35:39.170 region:rollup2
OPERATE IN THE WESTERN STATES.

00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:40.739 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS MOST OF

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:42.240 region:rollup2
THE UTILITIES THROUGHOUT THE

00:35:40.739 --> 00:35:43.942 region:rollup2
WESTERN STATES ARE ACTUALLY

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.676 region:rollup2
SEEKING OPPORTUNITIES TO

00:35:43.942 --> 00:35:46.044 region:rollup2
INTEGRATE HIGHER LEVELS OF

00:35:44.676 --> 00:35:47.612 region:rollup2
RENEWABLES.

00:35:46.044 --> 00:35:49.781 region:rollup2
AND SEE HOW THEY CAN DO THAT

00:35:47.612 --> 00:35:51.082 region:rollup2
ENSURING A RELIABLE GRID BUT

00:35:49.781 --> 00:35:52.517 region:rollup2
ALSO DO THAT IN THE MOST COST

00:35:51.082 --> 00:35:54.619 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE WAY TO REDUCE THEIR

00:35:52.517 --> 00:35:56.354 region:rollup2
COSTS AS WELL. SO THEY HAVE A

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:57.555 region:rollup2
SIMILAR SET OF GOALS THAT WE

00:35:56.354 --> 00:36:00.592 region:rollup2
HAVE HERE.

00:35:57.555 --> 00:36:01.760 region:rollup2
ON IN DOING THAT WE SEE THAT.

00:36:00.592 --> 00:36:03.261 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO NOT

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.430 region:rollup2
LOSE.

00:36:03.261 --> 00:36:06.898 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES IN TERMS OF THE

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:09.300 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THE SIZE

00:36:06.898 --> 00:36:10.669 region:rollup2
SO BECAUSE THE REALITY OF HIS

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.070 region:rollup2
THOSE UTILITIES ARE LOOKING.

00:36:10.669 --> 00:36:13.772 region:rollup2
AND THE MORE ENTITIES THAT WE

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:16.141 region:rollup2
CAN BRING TOGETHER UNDER THIS

00:36:13.772 --> 00:36:17.709 region:rollup2
ISO THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE

00:36:16.141 --> 00:36:19.010 region:rollup2
LOWER COSTS AND THE BENEFITS

00:36:17.709 --> 00:36:20.111 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT.

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.680 region:rollup2
HAPPEN AS WE BRING MORE MORE

00:36:20.111 --> 00:36:23.381 region:rollup2
ENTITIES TOGETHER.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:25.050 region:rollup2
SO TO BE SURE WE'VE DEVELOPED

00:36:23.381 --> 00:36:26.518 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW OUR RESPONSE TO THIS AS

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:28.119 region:rollup2
WELL AND SOME OF THE THINGS

00:36:26.518 --> 00:36:29.387 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE IS SOME VERY ADVANCED

00:36:28.119 --> 00:36:31.456 region:rollup2
A TECHNOLOGY AS I MENTIONED

00:36:29.387 --> 00:36:34.592 region:rollup2
BEFORE. PUT MORE POOR THE USING

00:36:31.456 --> 00:36:36.494 region:rollup2
OUR IT PLATFORM TO HELP IN AB

00:36:34.592 --> 00:36:37.796 region:rollup2
INTEGRATE AND ACTUALLY OPERATE

00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:39.230 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE HIGH LEVELS OF

00:36:37.796 --> 00:36:40.965 region:rollup2
STORAGE AS THE STATE STARTS TO

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:42.634 region:rollup2
ADD MORE AND MORE STORAGE TO THE

00:36:40.965 --> 00:36:44.402 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. IN ONE OF THE TOOLS TO

00:36:42.634 --> 00:36:46.337 region:rollup2
EMIGRATE RENEWABLES.

00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:47.872 region:rollup2
SO LET ME JUST SAY IN CLOSING.

00:36:46.337 --> 00:36:49.174 region:rollup2
THE THE ISO SUPPORTS

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:51.042 region:rollup2
THE CHAIRMAN'S GOALS CERTAINLY

00:36:49.174 --> 00:36:52.010 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF EXPLORING AT THE

00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:53.244 region:rollup2
GREAT THE OPPORTUNITIES

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:54.479 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FROM REGIONAL

00:36:53.244 --> 00:36:56.214 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION.

00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:58.283 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO TODAY IS

00:36:56.214 --> 00:37:00.085 region:rollup2
ARM SUPPOSED TO LET YOU KNOW

00:36:58.283 --> 00:37:01.820 region:rollup2
THAT WE SUPPORT THE LEGISLATION

00:37:00.085 --> 00:37:03.955 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD PROVIDE FOR A

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.856 region:rollup2
REGIONAL COLLABORATION. AND MORE

00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:06.357 region:rollup2
POORLY WE STAND READY TO TRY TO

00:37:04.856 --> 00:37:08.526 region:rollup2
BE A RESOURCE.

00:37:06.357 --> 00:37:09.861 region:rollup2

DEVELOPING SOME LEGISLATION THAT

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:17.368 region:rollup2
WOULD BE EFFECTIVE FOR

00:37:16.434 --> 00:37:18.503 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE

00:37:33.585 --> 00:37:36.121 region:rollup2
CONTINUING DISCUSSION ON THIS

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:37.756 region:rollup2
TOPIC.

00:37:36.121 --> 00:37:39.657 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M GONNA GO THROUGH IS

?

00:37:42.227 --> 00:37:46.831 region:rollup2
WHAT A BALANCING AREA AUTHORITY

00:37:43.995 --> 00:37:49.167 region:rollup2
DOES? UP THE CONTEXT OF WHERE

00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:50.335 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IT EXIST RELATIVE TO

00:37:49.167 --> 00:37:51.903 region:rollup2
THE REST OF THE WEST AND HOW

00:37:50.335 --> 00:37:53.671 region:rollup2
THEIR INTERCONNECTED.

00:37:51.903 --> 00:37:54.105 region:rollup2
I WILL DESCRIBE WHERE WE ARE IN

00:37:53.671 --> 00:37:56.274 region:rollup2
TERMS OF.

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:58.143 region:rollup2
INTEGRATING RENEWABLES AND

00:37:56.274 --> 00:37:59.744 region:rollup2
WHERE WHERE WE ARE LOOKING

00:37:58.143 --> 00:38:02.080 region:rollup2
FORWARD IN TERMS OF INTEGRATING

00:37:59.744 --> 00:38:03.081 region:rollup2

.

00:38:28.573 --> 00:38:31.676 region:rollup2
REALLY REGULATIONS AS PART OF A

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:33.311 region:rollup2
SUITE OF SOLUTIONS THAT WE

00:38:31.676 --> 00:38:35.079 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT ARE NECESSARY IF

00:38:33.311 --> 00:38:37.816 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE. THE

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:39.184 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVE OF A LOWER CARBON GRID

00:38:37.816 --> 00:38:42.053 region:rollup2
OUT OF IT AT A AT A REASONABLE

00:38:39.184 --> 00:38:42.287 region:rollup2
COST.

00:38:42.053 --> 00:38:44.155 region:rollup2
SO THAT.

00:38:42.287 --> 00:38:45.290 region:rollup2
.

00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:46.791 region:rollup2
JUST THAT IT'S A TRADING WHERE

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:48.560 region:rollup2
WOULD WHERE IS CALIFORNIA IS SO

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:50.094 region:rollup2
IS CALIFORNIA IS SO IS A

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.796 region:rollup2
BALANCING AUTHORITY AREAS.

00:38:50.094 --> 00:38:54.399 region:rollup2
MISTER PATTON HILL JUST

00:38:51.796 --> 00:38:56.201 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED WE ARE INTERCONNECTED

00:38:54.399 --> 00:38:58.903 region:rollup2
WE ARE THE LARGEST BALANCING

00:38:56.201 --> 00:39:01.039 region:rollup2
AREA AND TERMS OF A LOAD IN THE

00:38:58.903 --> 00:39:03.041 region:rollup2
WESTERN A CONNECTION. AND THAT

00:39:01.039 --> 00:39:04.709 region:rollup2
DIAGRAM OF THE OUTLINE OF THE

00:39:03.041 --> 00:39:07.312 region:rollup2
WESTERN UNITED STATES THAT

00:39:04.709 --> 00:39:08.046 region:rollup2
OUTLINED ILLUSTRATES THAT THIS

00:39:07.312 --> 00:39:10.481 region:rollup2
IS AN INTERCONNECTED SYSTEM.

00:39:08.046 --> 00:39:12.650 region:rollup2
THE WIRES THE RESOURCES ARE ALL

00:39:10.481 --> 00:39:13.985 region:rollup2
INTERCONNECTED SO RESOURCE THAT

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:15.954 region:rollup2
IS MOVING AT.

00:39:13.985 --> 00:39:18.122 region:rollup2
CERTAIN SPEED AND IN CALIFORNIA

00:39:15.954 --> 00:39:19.457 region:rollup2
IS MOVING THE SAME SPEAKERS

00:39:18.122 --> 00:39:20.792 region:rollup2
INTERCONNECTED EFFECTIVELY

00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:23.261 region:rollup2
CONNECTED TO OTHER RESOURCES

00:39:20.792 --> 00:39:25.396 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE WEST.

00:39:23.261 --> 00:39:27.565 region:rollup2
IF YOU GO FURTHER EAST YOU ARE

00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:30.001 region:rollup2
NOW INTO ANOTHER INTERCONNECTION

00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:32.270 region:rollup2
SO THE WHOLE WEST IS ONE MACHINE

00:39:30.001 --> 00:39:33.338 region:rollup2
IF YOU WANT TO CONSIDER THAT.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:34.706 region:rollup2
WE ARE THE ONLY.

00:39:33.338 --> 00:39:38.576 region:rollup2
CENTRALIZED.

00:39:34.706 --> 00:39:41.312 region:rollup2
MARKET OPERATING REST THE ISL.

00:39:38.576 --> 00:39:42.447 region:rollup2
ALBERTA IN CALLIN AND I CAN'T

00:39:41.312 --> 00:39:44.382 region:rollup2
CANADA.

00:39:42.447 --> 00:39:45.483 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A MARKET UP THERE IN

00:39:44.382 --> 00:39:47.252 region:rollup2
CANADA.

00:39:45.483 --> 00:39:49.087 region:rollup2
THERE IS A MARKET FORMING IN

00:39:47.252 --> 00:39:49.887 region:rollup2
THAT AREA THAT'S CALLED THE

00:39:49.087 --> 00:39:50.355 region:rollup2
MOUNTAIN WEST TRANSMISSION GROUP

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:52.023 region:rollup2
AND AS MR PETTING GILL

00:39:50.355 --> 00:39:54.292 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED.

00:39:52.023 --> 00:39:56.394 region:rollup2
SOUTHWEST POWER POOL IS

00:39:54.292 --> 00:39:58.496 region:rollup2
INTENDING TO PROVIDE BALANCING

00:39:56.394 --> 00:40:01.833 region:rollup2
AREA SERVICES AND PROVIDE MARKET

00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:03.167 region:rollup2
SERVICES. INTO THAT AREA.

00:40:01.833 --> 00:40:04.736 region:rollup2
THE REST OF THE WEST OF THIS IS

00:40:03.167 --> 00:40:06.304 region:rollup2
THAT THE YOU SEE IS GREEN IS

00:40:04.736 --> 00:40:07.872 region:rollup2
BASICALLY OPERATING IN A

00:40:06.304 --> 00:40:09.173 region:rollup2
BILATERAL ARRANGEMENTS.

00:40:07.872 --> 00:40:11.309 region:rollup2
THEY CALL SOMEONE MAKE A DEAL

00:40:09.173 --> 00:40:12.143 region:rollup2
WITH SOMEONE TO PRODUCE MORE

00:40:11.309 --> 00:40:13.811 region:rollup2
ENERGY.

00:40:12.143 --> 00:40:15.980 region:rollup2
TO BALANCE OUR SYSTEM.

00:40:13.811 --> 00:40:17.248 region:rollup2
THAT SAID THERE ARE THIRTY EIGHT

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.917 region:rollup2
BALANCING AUTHORITY AREAS IN THE

00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:19.517 region:rollup2
WEST.

00:40:18.917 --> 00:40:21.052 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE HAVE THE

00:40:19.517 --> 00:40:22.820 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY OF BASICALLY

00:40:21.052 --> 00:40:25.256 region:rollup2
BALANCING ON A SECOND BY SECOND

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:26.958 region:rollup2
BASIS LOADS AND RESOURCES.

00:40:25.256 --> 00:40:29.627 region:rollup2
SO ALL THESE THIRTY EIGHT

00:40:26.958 --> 00:40:31.129 region:rollup2
BOUNCING AREAS ARE INDIVIDUALLY.

00:40:29.627 --> 00:40:33.665 region:rollup2
COMING UP WITH THEIR RESOURCE

00:40:31.129 --> 00:40:36.301 region:rollup2
PLAN THERE DISPATCH PLAN

00:40:33.665 --> 00:40:38.870 region:rollup2
INTRADAY AND THEY ARE DOING THAT

00:40:36.301 --> 00:40:40.004 region:rollup2
IN A SEMI COORDINATED WAY. BUT

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:44.809 region:rollup2
THEY'RE FOCUSED ON WHAT THEY

00:40:40.004 --> 00:40:47.312 region:rollup2
NEED FOR THEIR SYSTEM.

00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:48.479 region:rollup2
SO JUST TO ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:40:47.312 --> 00:40:49.380 region:rollup2
COLOR AROUND.

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:51.015 region:rollup2
BALANCING

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.216 region:rollup2
OKAY

00:40:51.015 --> 00:40:54.152 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THE

00:40:52.216 --> 00:40:56.120 region:rollup2
BOUNCING AREA IS TO BASICALLY

00:40:54.152 --> 00:40:57.755 region:rollup2
BALANCE LOW THE RESOURCES.

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.824 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHAT I'M GONNA DESCRIBE

00:40:57.755 --> 00:41:00.658 region:rollup2
AND DISCUSS MORE THAN THE OTHER

00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:02.527 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS THERE ARE THERE ALL

00:41:00.658 --> 00:41:04.062 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS WE NEED TO MAINTAIN

00:41:02.527 --> 00:41:05.530 region:rollup2
RELIABILITY ENSURING THAT NO.

00:41:04.062 --> 00:41:07.031 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL TRANSMISSION ELEMENT

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:08.433 region:rollup2
IS OVERLOADED.

00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:10.335 region:rollup2
BASICALLY SO IN SECURING

00:41:08.433 --> 00:41:12.270 region:rollup2
SECURITY OF THE SYSTEM.

00:41:10.335 --> 00:41:13.938 region:rollup2
IF THERE IS A MAJOR OUTAGE WE

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:14.939 region:rollup2
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HELPING

00:41:13.938 --> 00:41:16.708 region:rollup2
REBUILD THE SYSTEM BACK UP.

00:41:14.939 --> 00:41:18.776 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:41:16.708 --> 00:41:20.211 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE THE

00:41:18.776 --> 00:41:22.714 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY OF ENSURING THAT

00:41:20.211 --> 00:41:24.515 region:rollup2
WE MAINTAIN ANOTHER RESERVES

00:41:22.714 --> 00:41:26.417 region:rollup2
OPERATING RESERVES SO THAT WE

00:41:24.515 --> 00:41:28.953 region:rollup2
ARE ALWAYS READY IN CASE WE LOSE

00:41:26.417 --> 00:41:31.756 region:rollup2
A RESOURCE. WE HAVE THE ABILITY

00:41:28.953 --> 00:41:33.958 region:rollup2
TO REPLACE THAT AND NOT HAVE ANY

00:41:31.756 --> 00:41:35.293 region:rollup2
INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE OKAY. SO

00:41:33.958 --> 00:41:36.394 region:rollup2
FOR THE REST MY DISCUSSION I'M

00:41:35.293 --> 00:41:37.995 region:rollup2
GONNA BE FOCUSING MORE AROUND

00:41:36.394 --> 00:41:40.131 region:rollup2
THE BALANCING PIECE.

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:41.399 region:rollup2
AND ON THE BALLOT IN PEACE.

00:41:40.131 --> 00:41:43.167 region:rollup2
YOU THINK THIS IS A BALANCING

00:41:41.399 --> 00:41:44.769 region:rollup2
ACT LOW THE RESOURCES IF THEY'RE

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:46.337 region:rollup2
IN BALANCE AND BECAUSE

00:41:44.769 --> 00:41:47.705 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY HAS TO BE CONSUMED

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:48.473 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME IT'S PRODUCED

00:41:47.705 --> 00:41:50.408 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY.

00:41:48.473 --> 00:41:52.176 region:rollup2
.

00:41:50.408 --> 00:41:54.379 region:rollup2
WHEN IT IS IN BALANCE WE ARE

00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:55.646 region:rollup2
HELPING MAINTAIN THE SPEED OF

00:41:54.379 --> 00:41:57.315 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM THE SPEED OF THE

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:58.649 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OF MEASURE BY. HURTS

00:41:57.315 --> 00:42:00.418 region:rollup2
SIXTY HERTZ

00:41:58.649 --> 00:42:02.353 region:rollup2
BLUE LIGHTS RIGHT NOW ARE

00:42:00.418 --> 00:42:04.589 region:rollup2
BASICALLY IN WITH A FLICKERING

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:05.089 region:rollup2
AT SIXTY HERTZ YOU DON'T SEE IT

00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:07.225 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ARE A TRIP IT'S

00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:08.693 region:rollup2
OCCURRING.

00:42:07.225 --> 00:42:10.228 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE DEMAND IS GREATER THAN

00:42:08.693 --> 00:42:12.430 region:rollup2
YOUR SUPPLY.

00:42:10.228 --> 00:42:15.099 region:rollup2
IT'S THE WILL SLOW DOWN.

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:17.035 region:rollup2
OKAY THE VERY NARROW BAND WHICH

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:19.637 region:rollup2
WE OPERATE BASICALLY PLUS OR

00:42:17.035 --> 00:42:22.039 region:rollup2
MINUS POINT ZERO SIX HERTZ IS

00:42:19.637 --> 00:42:23.808 region:rollup2
THE BAND OF WHICH WE OPERATE.

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:24.876 region:rollup2
IF IT SLOWS DOWN TOO MUCH.

00:42:23.808 --> 00:42:26.277 region:rollup2
WE BASICALLY GET TO THE POINT

00:42:24.876 --> 00:42:28.946 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAVE WITH IS AUTOMATIC

00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:30.314 region:rollup2
RELAYS IT WILL BASICALLY

00:42:28.946 --> 00:42:31.382 region:rollup2
INTERRUPT LOAD.

00:42:30.314 --> 00:42:36.454 region:rollup2
PROTECT THE SYSTEM THAT HAPPENS

00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:38.423 region:rollup2
AT FIFTY NINE POINT FIVE HURTS.

00:42:36.454 --> 00:42:40.391 region:rollup2
NOW YOU CAN ALSO HAVE TOO MUCH

00:42:38.423 --> 00:42:40.992 region:rollup2
SUPPLY AND THAT'S NOT GOOD

00:42:40.391 --> 00:42:43.194 region:rollup2
EITHER BECAUSE IF IT TOO MUCH

00:42:40.992 --> 00:42:44.929 region:rollup2
SUPPLY. YOU BASICALLY HAVE THE

00:42:43.194 --> 00:42:47.432 region:rollup2
SYSTEM RUNNING FASTER THAN IT

00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:48.132 region:rollup2
WOULD THAT IS DESIGNED FOR.

00:42:47.432 --> 00:42:50.134 region:rollup2
AND.

00:42:48.132 --> 00:42:52.003 region:rollup2
HAVING TOO MUCH SUPPLY CAN LEAD

00:42:50.134 --> 00:42:53.638 region:rollup2
TO EQUIPMENT DAMAGE IF IT'S

00:42:52.003 --> 00:42:55.440 region:rollup2
GOING TO FAST AND THAT COULD

00:42:53.638 --> 00:42:56.908 region:rollup2
CREATE PERMANENT DAMAGE SO WE

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.342 region:rollup2
BASICALLY HAVE TO CONSTANTLY

00:42:56.908 --> 00:43:00.378 region:rollup2
BALANCE.

00:42:58.342 --> 00:43:02.113 region:rollup2
LOADS IN RESOURCES OUR PURCHASES

00:43:00.378 --> 00:43:02.647 region:rollup2
OF ENERGY TO MAINTAIN THIS

00:43:02.113 --> 00:43:04.348 region:rollup2
BALANCE AND MAINTAIN SIXTY

00:43:02.647 --> 00:43:06.617 region:rollup2
HERTZ.

00:43:04.348 --> 00:43:07.985 region:rollup2
.

00:43:06.617 --> 00:43:08.753 region:rollup2
YOU MAY HAVE READ RECENTLY THAT.

00:43:07.985 --> 00:43:09.854 region:rollup2
.

00:43:08.753 --> 00:43:12.090 region:rollup2
IN THE.

00:43:09.854 --> 00:43:13.391 region:rollup2
SERBIA.

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:15.393 region:rollup2
THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO MAINTAIN

00:43:13.391 --> 00:43:17.061 region:rollup2
THIS FREQUENCY BALANCE A RESERVE

00:43:15.393 --> 00:43:18.296 region:rollup2
ISSUES BETWEEN THE AREAS. AND IN

00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:20.298 region:rollup2
FACT.

00:43:18.296 --> 00:43:23.101 region:rollup2
THEY ACTUALLY CHANGE TIME OR

00:43:20.298 --> 00:43:23.634 region:rollup2
SLOW DOWN TIME BY SIX MINUTES

00:43:23.101 --> 00:43:25.470 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T IN

00:43:23.634 --> 00:43:26.804 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT HOW TO MAINTAIN THIS

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:29.173 region:rollup2
BALANCE.

00:43:26.804 --> 00:43:30.842 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE.

00:43:29.173 --> 00:43:32.276 region:rollup2
ILLUSTRATION OF WHAT HAPPENS

00:43:30.842 --> 00:43:33.778 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT BALLOTS

00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:34.912 region:rollup2
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE'RE

00:43:33.778 --> 00:43:36.714 region:rollup2
TRYING TO MAINTAIN THIS BALANCE

00:43:34.912 --> 00:43:38.716 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE MAINTAIN RELIABILITY

00:43:36.714 --> 00:43:39.884 region:rollup2
AND WERE PREPARED FOR. BOUNCING

00:43:38.716 --> 00:43:45.923 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S ANY SYSTEM

00:43:39.884 --> 00:43:48.359 region:rollup2
DISTURBANCE.

00:43:45.923 --> 00:43:50.094 region:rollup2
WE MADE A TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:52.029 region:rollup2
INTEGRATING RENEWABLES.

00:43:50.094 --> 00:43:54.065 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT TWENTY ONE THOUSAND

00:43:52.029 --> 00:43:54.966 region:rollup2
MEGAWATTS FIRST OFF.

00:43:54.065 --> 00:43:57.635 region:rollup2
OUR P. CLOSE ABOUT FIFTY

00:43:54.966 --> 00:43:58.703 region:rollup2
THOUSAND MEGAWATTS.

00:43:57.635 --> 00:43:59.804 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TWENTY ONE THOUSAND

00:43:58.703 --> 00:44:02.673 region:rollup2
MEGAWATTS OF LARGE SCALE

00:43:59.804 --> 00:44:04.175 region:rollup2
RENEWABLES. INTER CONNECTED TO

00:44:02.673 --> 00:44:06.244 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA I AM SO GRID.

00:44:04.175 --> 00:44:07.778 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO THAT.

00:44:06.244 --> 00:44:10.081 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT SIX THOUSAND MEGAWATTS

00:44:07.778 --> 00:44:11.983 region:rollup2
OF ROOFTOP BEHIND THE METER

00:44:10.081 --> 00:44:13.284 region:rollup2
SOLAR CONNECTED THE GRIT. THAT

00:44:11.983 --> 00:44:15.052 region:rollup2
SIX THOUSAND MEGAWATTS A ROOFTOP

00:44:13.284 --> 00:44:16.821 region:rollup2
SOLAR WE DON'T SEE THAT WE DON'T

00:44:15.052 --> 00:44:19.590 region:rollup2
HAVE. VISIBILITY TO THAT

00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:22.226 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY ALL WE SEE IS LESS LOAD

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:23.060 region:rollup2
ON THE SYSTEM.

00:44:22.226 --> 00:44:24.662 region:rollup2
ON THE TWENTY ONE THOUSAND

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:26.831 region:rollup2
MEGAWATTS OF LARGE SCALE WE SEE

00:44:24.662 --> 00:44:28.866 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN SEE WAS PRODUCING WE

00:44:26.831 --> 00:44:30.635 region:rollup2
CAN MANAGE IT AND.

00:44:28.866 --> 00:44:32.637 region:rollup2
I INTO.

00:44:30.635 --> 00:44:35.640 region:rollup2
WELL BOUNCE.

00:44:32.637 --> 00:44:37.675 region:rollup2
AND WE WE MANAGED WE CAN SEE IT.

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:39.677 region:rollup2
THIS ALL GETS US.

00:44:37.675 --> 00:44:40.578 region:rollup2
WE'RE BASICALLY NEAR OUR GOAL OF

00:44:39.677 --> 00:44:43.447 region:rollup2
MEETING THIRTY THREE PERCENT OUR

00:44:40.578 --> 00:44:45.850 region:rollup2
PS.

00:44:43.447 --> 00:44:48.252 region:rollup2
AS WE MOVE ON AND WE MOVE ON TO

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:50.288 region:rollup2
FIFTY PERCENT ARE PS.

00:44:48.252 --> 00:44:52.223 region:rollup2
WE NOW HAVE TO GET ADDITIONAL

00:44:50.288 --> 00:44:53.491 region:rollup2
RENEWABLES BUILT ON THE SYSTEM.

00:44:52.223 --> 00:44:55.226 region:rollup2
AND ROUGHLY SPEAKING YOU NEED TO

00:44:53.491 --> 00:44:56.794 region:rollup2
ADD ANOTHER FIFTEEN THOUSAND

00:44:55.226 --> 00:44:58.296 region:rollup2
MEGAWATTS OF. RENEWABLE CAPACITY

00:44:56.794 --> 00:44:59.597 region:rollup2
IN THE SYSTEM.

00:44:58.296 --> 00:45:00.998 region:rollup2
AT THIS POINT WE DON'T KNOW

00:44:59.597 --> 00:45:02.967 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT THAT MIX OF

00:45:00.998 --> 00:45:05.069 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ARE GOING TO BE.

00:45:02.967 --> 00:45:07.939 region:rollup2
BASED ON CC.

00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:09.907 region:rollup2
PLANNING AND CPUC INTEGRATED

00:45:07.939 --> 00:45:11.576 region:rollup2
RESOURCE PLANNING IT LOOKS LIKE

00:45:09.907 --> 00:45:12.176 region:rollup2
ONE POSSIBILITY IS SOMETHING

00:45:11.576 --> 00:45:13.978 region:rollup2
AROUND.

00:45:12.176 --> 00:45:16.414 region:rollup2
ELEVEN THOUSAND.

00:45:13.978 --> 00:45:19.650 region:rollup2
PLUS MEGAWATTS OF ADDITIONAL

00:45:16.414 --> 00:45:21.752 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL ROOFTOP SOLAR.

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:24.288 region:rollup2
AGAIN A LOT OF THAT MAY NOT BE

00:45:21.752 --> 00:45:25.723 region:rollup2
VISIBLE TO THE OPERATOR.

00:45:24.288 --> 00:45:26.724 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO THAT IS ABOUT

00:45:25.723 --> 00:45:27.825 region:rollup2
THIRTY THREE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS

00:45:26.724 --> 00:45:29.493 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY OF ADDITIONAL

00:45:27.825 --> 00:45:31.229 region:rollup2
RENEWABLES.

00:45:29.493 --> 00:45:32.296 region:rollup2
ON THE GRID.

00:45:31.229 --> 00:45:34.632 region:rollup2
AND THAT MAYBE LARGELY SOLAR

00:45:32.296 --> 00:45:36.467 region:rollup2
RESOURCES.

00:45:34.632 --> 00:45:38.002 region:rollup2
SO.

00:45:36.467 --> 00:45:39.236 region:rollup2
WE DO THINK THAT FIFTY PERCENT

00:45:38.002 --> 00:45:41.472 region:rollup2
IS ACHIEVABLE BY TWENTY THIRTY.

00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:43.574 region:rollup2
IT CAN BE DONE.

00:45:41.472 --> 00:45:44.875 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:46.644 region:rollup2
THE WORK THAT WE DID TO GET TO

00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:48.212 region:rollup2
THIRTY THREE PERCENT.

00:45:46.644 --> 00:45:50.047 region:rollup2
THAT WORK HAS TO CONTINUE AND I

00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:51.282 region:rollup2
PROBABLY HAVE TO ACCELERATE IN

00:45:50.047 --> 00:45:53.918 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE SOLUTION AND THE

00:45:51.282 --> 00:45:56.787 region:rollup2
INNOVATION BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE

00:45:53.918 --> 00:45:56.787 region:rollup2
HARDER OPERATIONALLY.

00:45:56.854 --> 00:45:59.190 region:rollup2
TO FIFTY PERCENT.

00:45:58.623 --> 00:46:03.928 region:rollup2
BUT WILL LOOK FORWARD TO THE

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:05.596 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE.

00:46:03.928 --> 00:46:06.497 region:rollup2
WHAT IN TO SHOW YOU NOW

00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:06.731 region:rollup2
SOMETHING YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN

00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:08.466 region:rollup2
BEFORE?

00:46:06.731 --> 00:46:10.067 region:rollup2
?

00:46:08.466 --> 00:46:12.236 region:rollup2
BUT I WANT ILLUSTRATE THIS E. OF

00:46:10.067 --> 00:46:13.771 region:rollup2
THE DOCKER. STILL STRAIGHT WHERE

00:46:12.236 --> 00:46:14.872 region:rollup2
WE ARE.

00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:16.307 region:rollup2
WHERE WE THOUGHT WE WOULD BE BY

00:46:14.872 --> 00:46:18.442 region:rollup2
THIS POINT?

00:46:16.307 --> 00:46:20.778 region:rollup2
AND I'M GONNA ROLL INTO THE REST

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:22.947 region:rollup2
OF THE THE DIAGRAMS AND LEVERAGE

00:46:20.778 --> 00:46:24.715 region:rollup2
THIS INFORMATION.

00:46:22.947 --> 00:46:26.417 region:rollup2
SO WE PRODUCES FIRST OFF WHAT

00:46:24.715 --> 00:46:28.185 region:rollup2
YOU'RE LOOKING AS IS THE DOCTOR

00:46:26.417 --> 00:46:30.388 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE NET LOW THIS IS THE

00:46:28.185 --> 00:46:31.555 region:rollup2
LOAD MINAS.

00:46:30.388 --> 00:46:35.559 region:rollup2
VARIABLE RESOURCE OF THE WIND

00:46:31.555 --> 00:46:36.160 region:rollup2
AND SOLAR PRODUCTION.

00:46:35.559 --> 00:46:37.028 region:rollup2
THE REASON WHY WE TALK ABOUT.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.396 region:rollup2
NET LOW IS BECAUSE OF THE

00:46:37.028 --> 00:46:39.664 region:rollup2
BOUNCING AREA THAT'S EFFECTIVELY

00:46:38.396 --> 00:46:42.199 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HAVE TO BALANCE WITH THE

00:46:39.664 --> 00:46:44.168 region:rollup2
MOVE OTHER RESOURCES AROUND.

00:46:42.199 --> 00:46:45.269 region:rollup2
TO BALANCE THAT NET LOAD.

00:46:44.168 --> 00:46:46.404 region:rollup2
I DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THE

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:47.672 region:rollup2
VARIABLE RESOURCES FOR THE MOST

00:46:46.404 --> 00:46:49.707 region:rollup2
PART.

00:46:47.672 --> 00:46:52.510 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WERE REFER TO THE NET

00:46:49.707 --> 00:46:54.312 region:rollup2
LOW IS WHAT WE'RE BALANCING FOR.

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:55.413 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN SEE HERE WHEN WE PUT

00:46:54.312 --> 00:46:57.448 region:rollup2
THIS TOGETHER ABOUT SIX YEARS

00:46:55.413 --> 00:46:58.649 region:rollup2
AGO WE SAID OKAY WHAT WHAT'S

00:46:57.448 --> 00:47:01.419 region:rollup2
GONNA HAPPEN TO OUR NET LOAD.

00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:03.120 region:rollup2
OVERTIME AND YOU CAN SEE HERE

00:47:01.419 --> 00:47:04.221 region:rollup2
THAT WEEK WE EXPECTED AS.

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.990 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL RENEWABLES

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:08.359 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY SOLAR IN THE MIDDLE

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:10.094 region:rollup2
OF DAY PRODUCE.

00:47:08.359 --> 00:47:11.662 region:rollup2
WE WILL SEE THE NET LOW REDUCE

00:47:10.094 --> 00:47:14.298 region:rollup2
FURTHER AND FURTHER IN THAT

00:47:11.662 --> 00:47:15.566 region:rollup2
MIDDLE DAY CARE IT.

00:47:14.298 --> 00:47:16.600 region:rollup2
WE EXPECTED TO BE WOULD BE ABOUT

00:47:15.566 --> 00:47:19.336 region:rollup2
TWELVE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS BY

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:21.338 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY.

00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:23.507 region:rollup2
IN REALITY WE ARE CURRENTLY

00:47:21.338 --> 00:47:25.376 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN A DAY DAYS ABOUT

00:47:23.507 --> 00:47:27.311 region:rollup2
SEVEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. NET

00:47:25.376 --> 00:47:32.850 region:rollup2
LOAD IN THE MIDDLE ON NICE

00:47:27.311 --> 00:47:35.519 region:rollup2
SUNDAY SPRING CONDITION.

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:36.153 region:rollup2
AND I'LL EXPLAIN LATER WHY AND

00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:37.288 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT MEANS TO US IN TERMS

00:47:36.153 --> 00:47:39.223 region:rollup2
OF OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS BUT

00:47:37.288 --> 00:47:40.624 region:rollup2
THE POINT IS AND YOU MAY ASK

00:47:39.223 --> 00:47:41.926 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE

00:47:40.624 --> 00:47:43.361 region:rollup2
SIX THOUSAND MEGAWATTS WHY'D YOU

00:47:41.926 --> 00:47:45.596 region:rollup2
MISS. YOUR YOUR YOUR

00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:47.531 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS WHEN YOU MADE THIS

00:47:45.596 --> 00:47:49.066 region:rollup2
PROJECTION SIX YEARS AGO.

00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:50.935 region:rollup2
WHAT I THINK WE MISSED WAS THE

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:52.870 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF GROWTH AND?

00:47:50.935 --> 00:47:54.205 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF RENEWABLES ROOFTOP

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:55.439 region:rollup2
SOLAR. ó COMING ON TO THE

00:47:54.205 --> 00:47:56.474 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:47:55.439 --> 00:48:00.311 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE'RE REDUCED

00:47:56.474 --> 00:48:01.412 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY THE LOAD ITSELF AND.

00:48:00.311 --> 00:48:04.014 region:rollup2
BRACELET TRADING THE.

00:48:01.412 --> 00:48:05.516 region:rollup2
THE LOWER BELLY OF THE DOCK.

00:48:04.014 --> 00:48:07.485 region:rollup2
THE SECOND THING THAT THIS.

00:48:05.516 --> 00:48:10.388 region:rollup2
ILLUSTRATES

00:48:07.485 --> 00:48:12.690 region:rollup2
FROM OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE IS.

00:48:10.388 --> 00:48:14.458 region:rollup2
THE RAMP IN THE EVENING.

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:15.626 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN I'M BOUNCING THE

00:48:14.458 --> 00:48:17.628 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OPERATE COSTLY BALANCING

00:48:15.626 --> 00:48:19.663 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM.

00:48:17.628 --> 00:48:20.865 region:rollup2
AS THE LOAD CONTINUES TO GROW IN

00:48:19.663 --> 00:48:22.900 region:rollup2
THE EVENING PEOPLE GO HOME

00:48:20.865 --> 00:48:24.635 region:rollup2
LIGHTS COME ON.

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:27.138 region:rollup2
THE SOLAR IS ROLLING OFF SUN IS

00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:29.540 region:rollup2
SETTING AND NOW WE HAVE.

00:48:27.138 --> 00:48:30.941 region:rollup2
TO MANAGE BASICALLY.

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:32.343 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN THOUSAND WHAT WE'VE

00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:33.844 region:rollup2
SEEN NOW FOURTEEN THOUSAND PLUS

00:48:32.343 --> 00:48:35.045 region:rollup2
MEGAWATTS OVER A THREE HOUR

00:48:33.844 --> 00:48:37.014 region:rollup2
PERIOD.

00:48:35.045 --> 00:48:38.749 region:rollup2
BUT THAT IN CONTEXT.

00:48:37.014 --> 00:48:40.551 region:rollup2
REMOVING THE EQUIVALENT OF.

00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:42.686 region:rollup2
.

00:48:40.551 --> 00:48:45.289 region:rollup2
SIX DIABLO CANYONS

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:46.457 region:rollup2
OVER A THREE HOUR PERIOD THE

00:48:45.289 --> 00:48:48.692 region:rollup2
BALANCE OF SYSTEM AT THIS POINT.

00:48:46.457 --> 00:48:50.928 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:48:48.692 --> 00:48:52.663 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOTTEN GOOD AT DOING IT.

00:48:50.928 --> 00:48:53.898 region:rollup2
WE KNOW HOW TO DO IT. THERE'S

00:48:52.663 --> 00:48:55.699 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO

00:48:53.898 --> 00:48:57.134 region:rollup2
DO IT RIGHT NOW.

00:48:55.699 --> 00:49:00.438 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA TAKE STILL STRAIGHT.

00:48:57.134 --> 00:49:02.139 region:rollup2
NOW WHAT THE CHALLENGES.

00:49:00.438 --> 00:49:03.641 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TO DIVE INTO A COUPLE

00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:04.942 region:rollup2
THESE DAYS A LITTLE BIT DEEPER.

00:49:03.641 --> 00:49:06.277 region:rollup2
AND I APOLOGIZE THAT THESE ARE

00:49:04.942 --> 00:49:08.846 region:rollup2
BUSY SLIDES.

00:49:06.277 --> 00:49:10.047 region:rollup2
BUT IT.

00:49:08.846 --> 00:49:12.883 region:rollup2
STICK WITH ME HERE AS I LIKE

00:49:10.047 --> 00:49:13.884 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DESCRIBE THIS.

00:49:12.883 --> 00:49:15.119 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS FEBRUARY EIGHTEENTH

00:49:13.884 --> 00:49:16.520 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE DAY THAT I JUST JUST

00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:18.756 region:rollup2
DESCRIBE YOU THAT WE HAD A SEVEN

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:19.924 region:rollup2
THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. NET LOAD.

00:49:18.756 --> 00:49:21.892 region:rollup2
.

00:49:19.924 --> 00:49:23.627 region:rollup2
MINIMUM AT LOW DAY.

00:49:21.892 --> 00:49:27.231 region:rollup2
THAT NOW LOAD IS ILLUSTRATED BY

00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:29.433 region:rollup2
THAT GRAD DOTTED LINE.

00:49:27.231 --> 00:49:31.769 region:rollup2
OUR LOAD I DON'T LIKE IT.

00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:33.804 region:rollup2
OUR LOAD IS THAT BLACK LINE.

00:49:31.769 --> 00:49:35.573 region:rollup2
AT THE TOP.

00:49:33.804 --> 00:49:37.942 region:rollup2
OKAY SO IF YOU LOOK FROM THE

00:49:35.573 --> 00:49:41.145 region:rollup2
BOTTOM UP WHAT YOUR LEAK LOOKING

00:49:37.942 --> 00:49:42.580 region:rollup2
AT IS THE RESOURCE MIX.

00:49:41.145 --> 00:49:44.048 region:rollup2
THAT IS BEING PRODUCED TO

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:46.116 region:rollup2
BALANCE THE LOAD

00:49:44.048 --> 00:49:47.818 region:rollup2
STARTING FROM THE BOTTOM.

00:49:46.116 --> 00:49:50.521 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT A THOUSAND MEGAWATTS

00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:52.289 region:rollup2
OF DL CAN YOU CLEAR UP PLAN.

00:49:50.521 --> 00:49:54.258 region:rollup2
ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY WE HAD

00:49:52.289 --> 00:49:55.693 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE ON ONE OF THE UNITS.

00:49:54.258 --> 00:49:56.760 region:rollup2
SO AS A RESULT OF THAT WE CAN

00:49:55.693 --> 00:49:57.761 region:rollup2
HAVE TO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:59.296 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION WILL HELP THOUSAND

00:49:57.761 --> 00:50:00.764 region:rollup2
MEGAWATTS PRODUCTION.

00:49:59.296 --> 00:50:02.499 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE

00:50:00.764 --> 00:50:03.868 region:rollup2
THAT ACTUALLY MADE MORE ROOM FOR

00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:06.036 region:rollup2
THE RENEWABLES.

00:50:03.868 --> 00:50:07.338 region:rollup2
GOING UP.

00:50:06.036 --> 00:50:08.272 region:rollup2
WE NOW LOOK AT GEOTHERMAL

00:50:07.338 --> 00:50:09.940 region:rollup2
THERE'S ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED

00:50:08.272 --> 00:50:11.475 region:rollup2
MEGAWATTS GEOTHERMAL AND YOU CAN

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:13.210 region:rollup2
SEE IT'S LARGELY FLAT OVER THE

00:50:11.475 --> 00:50:14.712 region:rollup2
DAY IT'S LARGELY A BASELOAD

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:16.413 region:rollup2
RESOURCE.

00:50:14.712 --> 00:50:18.282 region:rollup2
THAT SAID THERE ARE GEOTHERMAL

00:50:16.413 --> 00:50:20.284 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT ARE FLEXIBLE AND

00:50:18.282 --> 00:50:21.852 region:rollup2
CAN BE DISPATCHED ON THIS

00:50:20.284 --> 00:50:23.721 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR DAY THERE WERE THEY

00:50:21.852 --> 00:50:25.956 region:rollup2
WERE NOT DISPATCHED.

00:50:23.721 --> 00:50:28.759 region:rollup2
THE NEXT LEVEL UP IS EFFECTIVELY

00:50:25.956 --> 00:50:30.561 region:rollup2
THE THERMAL OR GAS FLEET.

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:32.162 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT IN THE

00:50:30.561 --> 00:50:35.165 region:rollup2
MIDDLE OF THAT DAY WHEN WE HAVE

00:50:32.162 --> 00:50:36.901 region:rollup2
THE THE THE LOWEST THAT LOAD. WE

00:50:35.165 --> 00:50:38.736 region:rollup2
STILL HAVE ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED

00:50:36.901 --> 00:50:40.704 region:rollup2
TO TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF GAS

00:50:38.736 --> 00:50:41.739 region:rollup2
RESOURCE PRODUCING.

00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:44.575 region:rollup2
I'M GONNAMOVE A LITTLE FASTER

00:50:41.739 --> 00:50:46.210 region:rollup2
HERE NEXT UP IS HYDRO HYDRO WAS

00:50:44.575 --> 00:50:48.178 region:rollup2
LARGER RUN OF THE RIVER. I WOULD

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:50.114 region:rollup2
HAVE TO TAKE THAT. NEXT UP IS

00:50:48.178 --> 00:50:51.615 region:rollup2
IMPORTS THAT IMPORTS THIS IS THE

00:50:50.114 --> 00:50:53.117 region:rollup2
INTERCHANGE FROM OUTSIDE THE

00:50:51.615 --> 00:50:54.685 region:rollup2
AREA.

00:50:53.117 --> 00:50:56.420 region:rollup2
NAY YOU MAY ASK WELL WHY ISN'T

00:50:54.685 --> 00:50:58.422 region:rollup2
AT THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WHEN WE

00:50:56.420 --> 00:51:00.524 region:rollup2
HAVE THESE LOW NET LOADS AND

00:50:58.422 --> 00:51:01.825 region:rollup2
FRANKLY OVERSUPPLY CONDITIONS

00:51:00.524 --> 00:51:02.927 region:rollup2
WHY WE STILL IMPORTING FROM

00:51:01.825 --> 00:51:03.894 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE.

00:51:02.927 --> 00:51:06.397 region:rollup2
THE REASON IS THERE'S

00:51:03.894 --> 00:51:07.665 region:rollup2
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.

00:51:06.397 --> 00:51:09.199 region:rollup2
PALO VERDE IS A CONTRACTUAL

00:51:07.665 --> 00:51:11.201 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION TO BE DELIVERED TO

00:51:09.199 --> 00:51:12.570 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. THEIR* ALL ALL

00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:14.672 region:rollup2
ARE ALSO IS PROBABLY SOME

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:17.575 region:rollup2
RENEWABLES THAT ARE IN THAT NET

00:51:14.672 --> 00:51:19.176 region:rollup2
IMPORT.

00:51:17.575 --> 00:51:20.477 region:rollup2
NEXT UP YOU'LL SEE WIND SO

00:51:19.176 --> 00:51:21.345 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE GREEN THE DARKER

00:51:20.477 --> 00:51:22.746 region:rollup2
GREEN.

00:51:21.345 --> 00:51:24.715 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S PRODUCING ABOUT

00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:27.184 region:rollup2
THREE THOUSAND TO FOUR THOUSAND

00:51:24.715 --> 00:51:28.519 region:rollup2
MEGAWATTS AT THAT TIME. NEXT UP

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:30.020 region:rollup2
YOU SEE THE WITNESS THE SOLAR.

00:51:28.519 --> 00:51:32.423 region:rollup2
AND THAT SOLAR THE ABOUT EIGHT

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:33.958 region:rollup2
NINE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS.

00:51:32.423 --> 00:51:35.059 region:rollup2
IN THE NEXT UP YOU SEE THE RED

00:51:33.958 --> 00:51:36.293 region:rollup2
SECTION JUST ABOVE THE BLACK

00:51:35.059 --> 00:51:37.895 region:rollup2
LINE THAT BLACK LINE AGAIN WAS

00:51:36.293 --> 00:51:39.563 region:rollup2
THE LOAD.

00:51:37.895 --> 00:51:42.099 region:rollup2
THE READ INDICATES THAT WE

00:51:39.563 --> 00:51:43.334 region:rollup2
CANNOT TAKE ALL THE SOLAR.

00:51:42.099 --> 00:51:44.835 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE AMOUNT A SOLAR THAT

00:51:43.334 --> 00:51:46.236 region:rollup2
WE COULD NOT TAKE AND WE

00:51:44.835 --> 00:51:48.439 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY CURTAILED.

00:51:46.236 --> 00:51:49.039 region:rollup2
FORTUNATELY WE HAD ECONOMIC BIDS

00:51:48.439 --> 00:51:49.840 region:rollup2
TO CURTAIL SO WE COULD MANAGE

00:51:49.039 --> 00:51:51.475 region:rollup2
IT.

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.676 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS GOOD BUT EIGHT THERE

00:51:51.475 --> 00:51:54.445 region:rollup2
IS ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED

00:51:52.676 --> 00:51:55.946 region:rollup2
MEGAWATTS DURING THAT DAY THAT

00:51:54.445 --> 00:51:57.748 region:rollup2
WE COULD NOT USE ALL THE

00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:58.549 region:rollup2
RENEWABLES.

00:51:57.748 --> 00:52:02.753 region:rollup2
AND WE HAD A BASICALLY STOP THE

00:51:58.549 --> 00:52:04.588 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION.

00:52:02.753 --> 00:52:05.990 region:rollup2
NOW MOVING NOW FROM A REGIONAL

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:08.158 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE.

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:10.260 region:rollup2
WHAT THE REGIONAL OPPORTUNITY IN

00:52:08.158 --> 00:52:12.162 region:rollup2
ONE PART HELPS US DO IS THAT

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:14.865 region:rollup2
THAT?

00:52:12.162 --> 00:52:16.133 region:rollup2
LIGHT GREEN IMPORT.

00:52:14.865 --> 00:52:17.901 region:rollup2
IF WE HAVE A BETTER WAY OF

00:52:16.133 --> 00:52:19.903 region:rollup2
COORDINATING ACROSS THE WEST WE

00:52:17.901 --> 00:52:21.271 region:rollup2
MAY BE ACTUALLY TURN THAT AROUND

00:52:19.903 --> 00:52:23.507 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE COULD ACTUALLY DE

00:52:21.271 --> 00:52:25.609 region:rollup2
COMMIT RESOURCES EXTERNALLY.

00:52:23.507 --> 00:52:26.910 region:rollup2
BASED ON OUR ARE A HOW WE SEE

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:27.845 region:rollup2
THAT THE EXPECTATION OF THE

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:29.213 region:rollup2
WHOLE SYSTEM AND THEN OPTIMIZE

00:52:27.845 --> 00:52:30.848 region:rollup2
OF ALL SYSTEM.

00:52:29.213 --> 00:52:32.649 region:rollup2
WE COULD TURN THAT AROUND SO

00:52:30.848 --> 00:52:35.953 region:rollup2
IT'S THAT WE CAN MAKE MORE ROOM

00:52:32.649 --> 00:52:38.489 region:rollup2
FOR THE RENEWABLES IN STATE.

00:52:35.953 --> 00:52:39.890 region:rollup2
NOW I'M GONNA MOVE ONTO THEIR TO

00:52:38.489 --> 00:52:41.392 region:rollup2
I'M SURE I'M GONNA MOVE ON TO

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:43.560 region:rollup2
GROW QUICKLY THE EVENING WRAPPED

00:52:41.392 --> 00:52:44.128 region:rollup2
IN THIS PARTICULAR DAY WAS ONLY

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.029 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS

00:52:44.128 --> 00:52:46.497 region:rollup2
RAMP.

00:52:45.029 --> 00:52:48.832 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THAT'S FROM OUR

00:52:46.497 --> 00:52:49.466 region:rollup2
ENDING SIXTEEN TO THAT OUR IN

00:52:48.832 --> 00:52:50.968 region:rollup2
THE NINETEEN THAT'S THAT SHADED

00:52:49.466 --> 00:52:52.936 region:rollup2
AREA.

00:52:50.968 --> 00:52:54.204 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION I'M TRYING TO RUB

00:52:52.936 --> 00:52:56.006 region:rollup2
SHOW HERE OF WHAT A METRON

00:52:54.204 --> 00:52:57.541 region:rollup2
RESPONSES WHAT'S MEETING THAT

00:52:56.006 --> 00:52:59.209 region:rollup2
NET RAMP.

00:52:57.541 --> 00:53:00.277 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT SOLAR SOLAR TRAMPING

00:52:59.209 --> 00:53:01.445 region:rollup2
OUT SOLAR SHUTTING DOWN AT THIS

00:53:00.277 --> 00:53:02.813 region:rollup2
TIME.

00:53:01.445 --> 00:53:04.948 region:rollup2
WHAT'S MEETING THAT RAMP AND THE

00:53:02.813 --> 00:53:07.351 region:rollup2
EVENING PEAK.

00:53:04.948 --> 00:53:09.820 region:rollup2
IS IMPORTED ENERGY.

00:53:07.351 --> 00:53:11.288 region:rollup2
GAS RESOURCES IN CALIFORNIA. AND

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:13.457 region:rollup2
HYDRO AND THOSE PERCENTAGES

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:15.659 region:rollup2
DESCRIBE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT

00:53:13.457 --> 00:53:19.029 region:rollup2
EVENING RAMP IS BEING MET BY

00:53:15.659 --> 00:53:20.030 region:rollup2
THOSE PARTICULAR RESOURCES.

00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:21.832 region:rollup2
NOW WE HAVE A LONGER TERM

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:23.867 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVE TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON

00:53:21.832 --> 00:53:25.235 region:rollup2
GAS.

00:53:23.867 --> 00:53:27.805 region:rollup2
THEN THE QUESTION IS HOW SO

00:53:25.235 --> 00:53:28.806 region:rollup2
WE'RE TO MEET THAT EVENING RAN.

00:53:27.805 --> 00:53:30.307 region:rollup2
EITHER GONNA HAVE TO RELY MORE

00:53:28.806 --> 00:53:31.175 region:rollup2
ON IMPORTS.

00:53:30.307 --> 00:53:32.376 region:rollup2
ORGAN AFTER RELYING ON OTHER

00:53:31.175 --> 00:53:34.211 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS

00:53:32.376 --> 00:53:35.579 region:rollup2
STORAGE.

00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:37.414 region:rollup2
AND OTHER SOLUTIONS TO FILL THAT

00:53:35.579 --> 00:53:38.015 region:rollup2
EVENING.

00:53:37.414 --> 00:53:41.085 region:rollup2
THE SOLAR IS NOT PRODUCING AT

00:53:38.015 --> 00:53:42.619 region:rollup2
THAT POINT.

00:53:41.085 --> 00:53:43.987 region:rollup2
SINCE YOU NOW ARE NOW FAMILIAR

00:53:42.619 --> 00:53:45.489 region:rollup2
WITH THIS GRAPH I'M GONNA

00:53:43.987 --> 00:53:46.957 region:rollup2
PROBABLY JUST THAT GO THROUGH

00:53:45.489 --> 00:53:48.926 region:rollup2
THIS ONE A LITTLE BIT QUICKER

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:50.427 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE DAY. THAT WE HAVE

00:53:48.926 --> 00:53:51.829 region:rollup2
THE LARGEST THREE OUR RAMP IN

00:53:50.427 --> 00:53:53.363 region:rollup2
THE EVENING.

00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:54.898 region:rollup2
AND I JUST WANT US POINT OUT

00:53:53.363 --> 00:53:56.867 region:rollup2
THAT FOURTEEN THOUSAND MEGAWATT

00:53:54.898 --> 00:53:58.669 region:rollup2
EVENING AROUND ON THIS DAY.

00:53:56.867 --> 00:54:00.504 region:rollup2
WAS MET BY.

00:53:58.669 --> 00:54:02.139 region:rollup2
NOT SIXTY PERCENT IMPORTS BUT

00:54:00.504 --> 00:54:03.507 region:rollup2
THIRTY NINE PERCENT APART GAS

00:54:02.139 --> 00:54:05.676 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MET FIFTY PERCENT

00:54:03.507 --> 00:54:07.444 region:rollup2
ALMOST OF THAT LOAD ON THIS

00:54:05.676 --> 00:54:10.514 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR DAY. AND HYDRO

00:54:07.444 --> 00:54:11.849 region:rollup2
PROVIDED ABOUT TEN PERCENT.

00:54:10.514 --> 00:54:13.350 region:rollup2
BUT I'M TRYING TO SHOW HERE THAT

00:54:11.849 --> 00:54:15.886 region:rollup2
FROM DAY TO DAY YOU CAN'T MISS I

00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:17.354 region:rollup2
RELY ON THE SAME AMOUNT. FROM

00:54:15.886 --> 00:54:19.389 region:rollup2
EXTERNAL.

00:54:17.354 --> 00:54:19.990 region:rollup2
SOURCES.

00:54:19.389 --> 00:54:21.859 region:rollup2
THERE MAY BE IMPLICATED THERE

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:23.594 region:rollup2
MAY BE CONSTRAINTS OUTSIDE THEIR

00:54:21.859 --> 00:54:24.895 region:rollup2
LIMITING THAT ABILITY OF THAT OF

00:54:23.594 --> 00:54:26.196 region:rollup2
THOSE RESOURCES TO COME INTO

00:54:24.895 --> 00:54:27.865 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:54:26.196 --> 00:54:28.532 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO BE

00:54:27.865 --> 00:54:30.267 region:rollup2
READY TO BE ABLE TO.

00:54:28.532 --> 00:54:31.668 region:rollup2
HAVE A PROPER MIX TO BOUNCE

00:54:30.267 --> 00:54:33.437 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:35.639 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:54:33.437 --> 00:54:38.375 region:rollup2
IS MY LAST.

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:40.244 region:rollup2
A GRAPHICAL SLIDE.

00:54:38.375 --> 00:54:45.082 region:rollup2
I AM NOW SWITCHING SEASONS.

00:54:40.244 --> 00:54:46.784 region:rollup2
NOW I'M IN THE SUMMER.

00:54:45.082 --> 00:54:48.585 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE DAY THAT WE HAD THE

00:54:46.784 --> 00:54:50.587 region:rollup2
HIGHEST LOAD.

00:54:48.585 --> 00:54:52.489 region:rollup2
OF LAST YEAR.

00:54:50.587 --> 00:54:54.992 region:rollup2
OUR LOAD PEAK AT ABOUT FIFTY

00:54:52.489 --> 00:54:56.059 region:rollup2
THOUSAND MEGAWATTS.

00:54:54.992 --> 00:54:56.994 region:rollup2
WE HAVE NOT BEEN A FIFTY

00:54:56.059 --> 00:54:58.495 region:rollup2
THOUSAND MEGAWATTS SINCE TWO

00:54:56.994 --> 00:55:00.697 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SIX.

00:54:58.495 --> 00:55:02.966 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:55:00.697 --> 00:55:04.868 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND SIX.

00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:06.503 region:rollup2
JUST GIVE YOU A REFERENCE THAT

00:55:04.868 --> 00:55:08.038 region:rollup2
WAS A ONE IN ABOUT ONE HUNDRED

00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:11.074 region:rollup2
TEMPERATURE DAY.

00:55:08.038 --> 00:55:14.344 region:rollup2
THIS WAS THE ONE IN NINETEEN

00:55:11.074 --> 00:55:15.679 region:rollup2
YEAR TEMPERATURE DAY.

00:55:14.344 --> 00:55:17.548 region:rollup2
THE CONSIDER BETWEEN TWO

00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:19.850 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SIX AND NOW TWO

00:55:17.548 --> 00:55:20.951 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I JUST.

00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:22.319 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN TO WE HAVE ABOUT SIX

00:55:20.951 --> 00:55:25.355 region:rollup2
THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF ADDITIONAL

00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:26.423 region:rollup2
SOLAR BEHIND THE METER.

00:55:25.355 --> 00:55:27.658 region:rollup2
IF WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN

00:55:26.423 --> 00:55:29.226 region:rollup2
INTEGRATING ALL THAT BEHIND THE

00:55:27.658 --> 00:55:30.093 region:rollup2
METER SOLAR THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:55:29.226 --> 00:55:31.695 region:rollup2
A FIFTY SIX THOUSAND MEGAWATT

00:55:30.093 --> 00:55:34.097 region:rollup2
DAY.

00:55:31.695 --> 00:55:35.199 region:rollup2
OKAY SO.

00:55:34.097 --> 00:55:36.834 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT WE ARE INTEGRATED

00:55:35.199 --> 00:55:38.702 region:rollup2
RENEWABLES IS HELPING MANAGE OUR

00:55:36.834 --> 00:55:41.805 region:rollup2
LOW.

00:55:38.702 --> 00:55:43.807 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

00:55:41.805 --> 00:55:45.542 region:rollup2
AS THE SUN GOES DOWN.

00:55:43.807 --> 00:55:47.644 region:rollup2
FIRST UP.

00:55:45.542 --> 00:55:49.546 region:rollup2
SO WE. WE ARE EXPECTING IN WE WE

00:55:47.644 --> 00:55:51.348 region:rollup2
FORECASTED WITH ABOUT FORTY

00:55:49.546 --> 00:55:52.449 region:rollup2
EIGHT THOUSAND MEGAWATTS LOAD

00:55:51.348 --> 00:55:53.951 region:rollup2
FORTY SIX THOUSAND MEGAWATTS

00:55:52.449 --> 00:55:54.585 region:rollup2
LOAD FOR THIS PARTICULAR YEAR

00:55:53.951 --> 00:55:56.787 region:rollup2
PEAK.

00:55:54.585 --> 00:55:58.188 region:rollup2
WE EXCEEDED THAT.

00:55:56.787 --> 00:56:00.757 region:rollup2
OKAY THAT HAPPENS TEMPERATURE

00:55:58.188 --> 00:56:03.093 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS CHANGE.

00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:03.694 region:rollup2
WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN OUR LOAD

00:56:03.093 --> 00:56:06.096 region:rollup2
WHICH IS REPRESENTED BY THAT

00:56:03.694 --> 00:56:06.863 region:rollup2
WHERE THAT DOTTED RED LINE AND

00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:08.932 region:rollup2
THE BLACK LINE ME.

00:56:06.863 --> 00:56:11.068 region:rollup2
STILL.

00:56:08.932 --> 00:56:13.470 region:rollup2
HIGHER THAN OUR FORECAST OF NET

00:56:11.068 --> 00:56:16.673 region:rollup2
LOW OR FORECASTED LOAD FOR THE

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:17.307 region:rollup2
ENTIRE YEAR WAS EXPECTED TO BE.

00:56:16.673 --> 00:56:19.443 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE NO SOLAR PRODUCTION

00:56:17.307 --> 00:56:20.711 region:rollup2
AT THAT.

00:56:19.443 --> 00:56:23.113 region:rollup2
SO WHAT THAT MEANS AND IT'S

00:56:20.711 --> 00:56:25.582 region:rollup2
ILLUSTRATED HERE'S TO MEET THAT

00:56:23.113 --> 00:56:27.084 region:rollup2
TWO HOUR LATER. LOW LEVEL THAT

00:56:25.582 --> 00:56:28.719 region:rollup2
STILL VERY HIGH WHAT DID WE RELY

00:56:27.084 --> 00:56:30.587 region:rollup2
ON.

00:56:28.719 --> 00:56:32.122 region:rollup2
WE RELIED ON A SIGNIFICANT

00:56:30.587 --> 00:56:34.291 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF GAS RESOURCES AS

00:56:32.122 --> 00:56:35.692 region:rollup2
REPRESENTED BY THE BROWN.

00:56:34.291 --> 00:56:36.994 region:rollup2
HYDRO WHICH WAS A GOOD HYDRO

00:56:35.692 --> 00:56:38.595 region:rollup2
YOUR LAST YEAR SO WE'RE VERY

00:56:36.994 --> 00:56:39.897 region:rollup2
FORTUNATE.

00:56:38.595 --> 00:56:41.498 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE GREEN WHICH IS ON

00:56:39.897 --> 00:56:43.467 region:rollup2
THAT IN COURT OF ABOUT I THINK

00:56:41.498 --> 00:56:47.738 region:rollup2
ABOUT EIGHT TO NINE THOUSAND

00:56:43.467 --> 00:56:50.040 region:rollup2
MEGAWATTS OF NET IMPORT.

00:56:47.738 --> 00:56:52.009 region:rollup2
THIS IS HOW WE MEET OUR LOW.

00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:53.744 region:rollup2
FROM AN OPERATOR'S PERSPECTIVE.

00:56:52.009 --> 00:56:55.979 region:rollup2
THEIR STRESS LEVEL WAS NOT AT

00:56:53.744 --> 00:56:58.148 region:rollup2
THE TIME WHEN WE PEAKED.

00:56:55.979 --> 00:57:00.183 region:rollup2
THEIR STRESS LEVEL WAS HIGHEST

00:56:58.148 --> 00:57:02.619 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THAT TIME. AND WHEN WE

00:57:00.183 --> 00:57:03.420 region:rollup2
HIT THAT TWO HOUR THREE HOUR

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:05.889 region:rollup2
LOOK LATER PEAK.

00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:07.291 region:rollup2
THAT'S BECAUSE.

00:57:05.889 --> 00:57:08.492 region:rollup2
LOOK NET LOW TO STILL GROWING ON

00:57:07.291 --> 00:57:10.060 region:rollup2
THEM.

00:57:08.492 --> 00:57:11.628 region:rollup2
THEY'RE LOSING EIGHT THOUSAND

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:12.562 region:rollup2
MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR.

00:57:11.628 --> 00:57:14.531 region:rollup2
AND THEY STILL HAVE TO BALANCE

00:57:12.562 --> 00:57:17.067 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM.

00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:17.968 region:rollup2
AGAIN I WANNA POINT OUT.

00:57:17.067 --> 00:57:19.369 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO DO

00:57:17.968 --> 00:57:21.939 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:57:19.369 --> 00:57:23.907 region:rollup2
WE ARE ABLE TO MANAGE IT.

00:57:21.939 --> 00:57:25.442 region:rollup2
PLAYING THIS FORWARD NOW.

00:57:23.907 --> 00:57:28.378 region:rollup2
WE'LL HAVE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

00:57:25.442 --> 00:57:30.180 region:rollup2
MORE RENEWABLE RESOURCES.

00:57:28.378 --> 00:57:30.747 region:rollup2
THE GAS FLEET MAY NOT BE THE

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:32.549 region:rollup2
SAME GAS FLEET THAT WE HAVE

00:57:30.747 --> 00:57:34.151 region:rollup2
TODAY.

00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:36.019 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE TO START LOOKING FOR

00:57:34.151 --> 00:57:37.521 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS.

00:57:36.019 --> 00:57:39.156 region:rollup2
TO HELP BOUNCE THE SYSTEM

00:57:37.521 --> 00:57:41.058 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE THERE COULD BE

00:57:39.156 --> 00:57:42.659 region:rollup2
INSUFFICIENT RAMPING OR

00:57:41.058 --> 00:57:44.161 region:rollup2
INSUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO MEET

00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:45.562 region:rollup2
THE LOW.

00:57:44.161 --> 00:57:48.098 region:rollup2
AND THAT WILL NOT BE GOOD THAT

00:57:45.562 --> 00:57:51.001 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A RELIABILITY ISSUE.

00:57:48.098 --> 00:57:52.302 region:rollup2
SO IN SUMMARY.

00:57:51.001 --> 00:57:53.870 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M SHOWING YOU HERE IS

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:54.771 region:rollup2
THAT I'M NOT JUST FOCUSED WE'RE

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:56.506 region:rollup2
NOT JUST FOCUSED ON

00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:57.841 region:rollup2
REGIONALIZATION THERE IS A SUITE

00:57:56.506 --> 00:57:59.676 region:rollup2
OF SOLUTIONS THAT'S GOING TO BE

00:57:57.841 --> 00:58:02.112 region:rollup2
NECESSARY? THIS IS A BIG ENOUGH

00:57:59.676 --> 00:58:03.814 region:rollup2
SCALE ISSUE THAT WE NEED A

00:58:02.112 --> 00:58:05.649 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS

00:58:03.814 --> 00:58:07.884 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT BE FOR STORAGE LARGE

00:58:05.649 --> 00:58:09.886 region:rollup2
SCALE TO BATTERY STORAGE. DEMAND

00:58:07.884 --> 00:58:11.521 region:rollup2
RESPONSE.

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:13.223 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC VEHICLES ACTUALLY

00:58:11.521 --> 00:58:15.192 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING IN BACK HELPING

00:58:13.223 --> 00:58:17.327 region:rollup2
BALANCE THE SYSTEM.

00:58:15.192 --> 00:58:18.061 region:rollup2
THE RENEWABLE THEMSELVES HAVING

00:58:17.327 --> 00:58:20.397 region:rollup2
THEM DISPATCH A BOWL AND

00:58:18.061 --> 00:58:21.631 region:rollup2
PROVIDING RELIABILITY SERVICES

00:58:20.397 --> 00:58:23.934 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN

00:58:21.631 --> 00:58:25.168 region:rollup2
PROVIDED BY THE GAS FLEET.

00:58:23.934 --> 00:58:26.970 region:rollup2
GETTING THOSE RESOURCE TO

00:58:25.168 --> 00:58:28.772 region:rollup2
PROVIDE RELIABILITY. WE'VE BEEN

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:31.008 region:rollup2
PER WE'VE PROVEN THAT THAT CAN

00:58:28.772 --> 00:58:33.377 region:rollup2
HAPPEN TECHNOLOGICALLY.

00:58:31.008 --> 00:58:35.512 region:rollup2
AND THEN LASTLY WE'VE STARTED TO

00:58:33.377 --> 00:58:37.080 region:rollup2
SEE HOW REGIONALIZATION.

00:58:35.512 --> 00:58:38.448 region:rollup2
THROUGH AT LEAST INITIALLY THE

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:40.484 region:rollup2
ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET HAS BEEN

00:58:38.448 --> 00:58:42.219 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL IN HELPING US MANAGE

00:58:40.484 --> 00:58:43.420 region:rollup2
THESE RENEWABLES.

00:58:42.219 --> 00:58:46.056 region:rollup2
ON THAT DAY WHEN WE HAD OVER

00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:47.257 region:rollup2
SUPPLY WE ARE ACTUALLY USING THE

00:58:46.056 --> 00:58:48.525 region:rollup2
ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET AND WE

00:58:47.257 --> 00:58:50.293 region:rollup2
WERE SENDING THREE THOUSAND

00:58:48.525 --> 00:58:52.229 region:rollup2
MEGAWATTS OUT TO OTHER PARTS OF

00:58:50.293 --> 00:58:54.297 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM. AND THEN BRING IT

00:58:52.229 --> 00:58:55.866 region:rollup2
BACK AGAIN THREE HOURS LATER

00:58:54.297 --> 00:58:57.534 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HAD TO TAKE THAT RAMP.

00:58:55.866 --> 00:59:00.504 region:rollup2
IT'S AN EFFECTIVE USE OF THE

00:58:57.534 --> 00:59:01.872 region:rollup2
REGIONAL RESOURCES.

00:59:00.504 --> 00:59:03.073 region:rollup2
WHAT THE REGIONALIZATION THE

00:59:01.872 --> 00:59:05.742 region:rollup2
BROADER REGIONALIZATION DOESN'T

00:59:03.073 --> 00:59:08.445 region:rollup2
MOVE THAT FROM REAL TIME TO NOW

00:59:05.742 --> 00:59:09.679 region:rollup2
DAY AHEAD AND ALSO POTENTIALLY

00:59:08.445 --> 00:59:11.581 region:rollup2
PLANNING FOR LONGER TERM

00:59:09.679 --> 00:59:14.951 region:rollup2
CAPACITY? GETTING THE RIGHT MIX

00:59:11.581 --> 00:59:16.019 region:rollup2
OF RESOURCES IN THE SYSTEM.

00:59:14.951 --> 00:59:18.188 region:rollup2
AND THEN LASTLY.

00:59:16.019 --> 00:59:19.990 region:rollup2
BUT I'LL CLOSE WITH THAT I

00:59:18.188 --> 00:59:20.390 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S WERE LIKE THOSE AND

00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:22.225 region:rollup2
I'M.

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:23.293 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY WE CAN CONTINUE THIS

00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:24.628 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW

00:59:23.293 --> 00:59:26.763 region:rollup2
REGIONALIZATION.

00:59:24.628 --> 00:59:27.931 region:rollup2
IS AN EFFECTIVE NOT THE ONLY

00:59:26.763 --> 00:59:30.066 region:rollup2
SOLUTION BUT AN EFFECTIVE

00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:31.735 region:rollup2
SOLUTION HELPING US OPERATE THE

00:59:30.066 --> 00:59:35.005 region:rollup2
GRID IN AND DO IT A COST

00:59:31.735 --> 00:59:37.107 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE WAY.

00:59:35.005 --> 00:59:39.009 region:rollup2
BUT WE APPRECIATE THE.

00:59:37.107 --> 00:59:40.110 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION THEN VERY THE

00:59:39.009 --> 00:59:41.945 region:rollup2
CLARITY ON THAT I'M GONNA TURN

00:59:40.110 --> 00:59:43.513 region:rollup2
TO MEMBERS IF YOU HAVE ANY

00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:49.019 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS OF THIS PANEL BEFORE

00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:51.121 region:rollup2
WE MOVE ON TO OUR. NEXT.

00:59:49.019 --> 00:59:52.322 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NONE PROFESSOR.

00:59:51.121 --> 00:59:54.458 region:rollup2
SQUARE HARM.

00:59:52.322 --> 00:59:55.492 region:rollup2
SO I THOUGHT THANK YOU BOTH FOR

00:59:54.458 --> 00:59:57.894 region:rollup2
YOUR UP PRESENTATIONS.

00:59:55.492 --> 00:59:59.463 region:rollup2
.

00:59:57.894 --> 01:00:01.298 region:rollup2
CLEARLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:59:59.463 --> 01:00:03.533 region:rollup2
WE COULD BENEFIT FROM BY THE WAY

01:00:01.298 --> 01:00:05.268 region:rollup2
I NOTICED ON THAT PEAK DAY IF

01:00:03.533 --> 01:00:06.803 region:rollup2
YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO THAT FOR.

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:07.838 region:rollup2
THERE WAS NO WIND.

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:09.473 region:rollup2
YEAH GOOD POINT.

01:00:07.838 --> 01:00:11.174 region:rollup2
THERE OTHER THERE IS NO DARK

01:00:09.473 --> 01:00:12.843 region:rollup2
GREEN WELL THERE IS.

01:00:11.174 --> 01:00:14.344 region:rollup2
I CITY THERE'S A SMALL AMOUNT

01:00:12.843 --> 01:00:16.012 region:rollup2
YEAH HARDLY BEEN THAT'S NOT

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:17.147 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT UNUSUAL ON THE

01:00:16.012 --> 01:00:18.482 region:rollup2
HOTTEST DAYS AND THE WIND IN

01:00:17.147 --> 01:00:19.683 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:00:18.482 --> 01:00:21.718 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WELL UPS.

01:00:19.683 --> 01:00:23.420 region:rollup2
SO.

01:00:21.718 --> 01:00:25.355 region:rollup2
CLEARLY IF WE'RE GOING WE DON'T

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:26.723 region:rollup2
HAVE ANYONE TO OUR WEST SO WE'RE

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:28.258 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO GET SOLAR TO HELP

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:30.794 region:rollup2
US WITH THE EVENING PEAK.

01:00:28.258 --> 01:00:32.462 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE PEOPLE TO THE EAST.

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:34.564 region:rollup2
OUR PARTICULAR IN THE SPRING

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:36.032 region:rollup2
THERE'S AM MORNING RAM. THAT

01:00:34.564 --> 01:00:37.834 region:rollup2
COULD CLEARLY HELP WITH SOLAR.

01:00:36.032 --> 01:00:40.170 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO.

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:42.606 region:rollup2
WIND AND.

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:43.974 region:rollup2
WYOMING THAT GOES ALL THE TIME

01:00:42.606 --> 01:00:46.376 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED MORE TRANSMISSION

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:49.045 region:rollup2
FOR THAT HOW DO YOU VISUALIZE

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:50.780 region:rollup2
THE IMPORT OF RENEWABLES FROM

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:52.916 region:rollup2
OTHER AREAS I'VE MENTIONED A

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:54.784 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF POSSIBILITIES PERHAPS

01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:56.820 region:rollup2
YOU COULD EXPAND ON THAT.

01:00:54.784 --> 01:00:57.220 region:rollup2
WE MAKE A GOOD POINT THAT FROM A

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.855 region:rollup2
SOLAR PERSPECTIVE.

01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:01.458 region:rollup2
.

01:00:58.855 --> 01:01:02.058 region:rollup2
THAT THE SOLAR TO THE EAST WILL

01:01:01.458 --> 01:01:03.627 region:rollup2
BE.

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:06.396 region:rollup2
BASICALLY ON.

01:01:03.627 --> 01:01:08.431 region:rollup2
TURN DOWN BEFORE OUR OUR SOLAR.

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:10.167 region:rollup2
I THINK FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:11.801 region:rollup2
WHEN WE STILL HAVE SOLAR WE MY

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:13.136 region:rollup2
BILL WILL BE MEETING BECAUSE WE

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:14.804 region:rollup2
HAVE AN ADDITIONAL SUPPLY THAN

01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:17.908 region:rollup2
WE NEED WE COULD BE SERVING SOME

01:01:14.804 --> 01:01:19.643 region:rollup2
OF THEIR. LOAD WITH OURS RATHER

01:01:17.908 --> 01:01:21.411 region:rollup2
THAN CURTAILING THE RENEWABLES.

01:01:19.643 --> 01:01:23.513 region:rollup2
WE ARE HELP THEM MEET THEIR

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:24.748 region:rollup2
EVENING PEAK YES.

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:26.449 region:rollup2
FROM A NGUYEN PERSPECTIVE THERE

01:01:24.748 --> 01:01:29.119 region:rollup2
IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WIND

01:01:26.449 --> 01:01:32.189 region:rollup2
AND A. NGUYEN THAT DOESN'T.

01:01:29.119 --> 01:01:33.557 region:rollup2
DIE OFF IN THE HOTTEST DAYS OF

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:35.859 region:rollup2
ACTION BLOWS AND AND IN THE

01:01:33.557 --> 01:01:37.827 region:rollup2
MIDDLE DE ON THE HOTTEST DAYS.

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:39.095 region:rollup2
IN WYOMING INTO MEXICO.

01:01:37.827 --> 01:01:40.463 region:rollup2
I'M DESCRIBING WHAT THE

01:01:39.095 --> 01:01:41.765 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITIES ARE AND I WANNA BE

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:43.266 region:rollup2
CLEAR.

01:01:41.765 --> 01:01:45.569 region:rollup2
LIFE IS SO DOESN'T

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:47.504 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHAT RESOURCES WE

01:01:45.569 --> 01:01:49.206 region:rollup2
SHOULD DEVELOP AND PROCURE GOING

01:01:47.504 --> 01:01:50.807 region:rollup2
FORWARD THAT'S A STATE POLICY

01:01:49.206 --> 01:01:52.542 region:rollup2
DECISION.

01:01:50.807 --> 01:01:54.444 region:rollup2
WE ONLY DISPATCH WHAT IS THE

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:56.513 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:57.547 region:rollup2
US AND WE BOUNCE A SYSTEM.

01:01:56.513 --> 01:01:59.049 region:rollup2
SO THE DECISION ABOUT

01:01:57.547 --> 01:02:01.284 region:rollup2
REGIONALIZATION DOESN'T

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:03.653 region:rollup2
DETERMINE. BUT IT DOES PROVIDE

01:02:01.284 --> 01:02:05.155 region:rollup2
AN OPTION AUDI THAT YOU CAN TO

01:02:03.653 --> 01:02:06.289 region:rollup2
NOW LOOK AT A BROADER SET OF

01:02:05.155 --> 01:02:08.291 region:rollup2
RESOURCE OF THE WEST BUT IT

01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:10.126 region:rollup2
DOESN'T REQUIRE YOU AS A STATE.

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:10.760 region:rollup2
TO GO GET THOSE RESOURCES YOU

01:02:10.126 --> 01:02:11.261 region:rollup2
CAN MAKE THOSE DECISIONS OF THE

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.362 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:02:11.261 --> 01:02:14.097 region:rollup2
SO.

01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:15.432 region:rollup2
WHAT?

RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE ENERGY

01:02:15.432 --> 01:02:19.002 region:rollup2
IMBALANCE MARKET WHICH IS

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:20.904 region:rollup2
BASICALLY.

01:02:19.002 --> 01:02:21.838 region:rollup2
BOB YOU'RE MEETING THANKS WHAT

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:23.039 region:rollup2
IS SAID IN A FIVE MINUTE.

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:24.841 region:rollup2
YES SO WE DISPATCHED ON A FIVE

01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:26.810 region:rollup2
AND FIFTEEN MINUTE BASIS.

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:28.645 region:rollup2
ACROSS NOW ROUGHLY HALF THE

01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:30.013 region:rollup2
WEST.

01:02:28.645 --> 01:02:31.147 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I'M ONE OF THE

01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:32.882 region:rollup2
SUGGESTIONS WE'RE GOING TO HEAR

01:02:31.147 --> 01:02:33.450 region:rollup2
FROM A LATER PANEL THAT I BRING

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:35.251 region:rollup2
THIS UP IS A QUESTION TO YOU

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:37.053 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:40.290 region:rollup2
IS COULD WE.

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:42.092 region:rollup2
EXPAND BE ENERGY IMBALANCE

01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:43.560 region:rollup2
MARKET WHICH IS NOW FOR FIVE AND

01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:45.362 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN MINUTES

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:48.231 region:rollup2
TO A LONGER TIME.

01:02:45.362 --> 01:02:51.234 region:rollup2
TO GET STARTED ON SOME OF THESE

01:02:48.231 --> 01:02:52.736 region:rollup2
ISSUES ARE BEFORE THE POLITICAL

01:02:51.234 --> 01:02:57.274 region:rollup2
ISSUES ARE NECESSARILY.

01:02:52.736 --> 01:02:58.975 region:rollup2
SETTLED IS THAT FEASIBLE OR NOT.

01:02:57.274 --> 01:03:00.543 region:rollup2
IT'S POTENTIALLY FOR. HIS

01:02:58.975 --> 01:03:02.746 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY FEASIBLE.

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:04.614 region:rollup2
YEAH.

01:03:02.746 --> 01:03:07.017 region:rollup2
THAT IT WOULD ENERGY IMBALANCE

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:09.786 region:rollup2
MARKET SAY FOR DAY AHEAD.

01:03:07.017 --> 01:03:09.986 region:rollup2
SO WE ARE INVESTIGATING ACT.

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:12.889 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:03:09.986 --> 01:03:14.591 region:rollup2
.

01:03:12.889 --> 01:03:16.660 region:rollup2
THE THE POINT ONE MAKE ON THAT

01:03:14.591 --> 01:03:18.328 region:rollup2
THAT ANSWER THOUGH IS THAT.

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:19.963 region:rollup2
WHILE IT MAYBE ILL GET YOU A

01:03:18.328 --> 01:03:20.630 region:rollup2
PORTION OF THE BENEFITS THAT

01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:22.298 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:24.634 region:rollup2
REGIONALIZATION WOULD DO WHAT

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:26.403 region:rollup2
WOULD COULD COVER.

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:27.437 region:rollup2
IT WAS TOUGH TO BE VOLUNTARY.

01:03:26.403 --> 01:03:29.272 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:30.540 region:rollup2
THE BOUNCING AREAS WOULD HAVE

01:03:29.272 --> 01:03:32.008 region:rollup2
TO VOLUNTARILY DECIDE THAT THEY

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:33.510 region:rollup2
WANT TO PARTICIPATE.

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:36.212 region:rollup2
IT MAY NOT PER PROVIDE AS MUCH

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:39.149 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION AND EFFECTIVENESS.

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:41.051 region:rollup2
AS. A REGIONAL MARKET WOULD I

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:42.619 region:rollup2
SAY AND. DO INVEST IN

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:44.621 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION YOU'RE GONNA NEED

01:03:42.619 --> 01:03:47.357 region:rollup2
THAT LEVEL OF CERTAINTY.

01:03:44.621 --> 01:03:49.159 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK THIS NOT EVEN ABOUT

01:03:47.357 --> 01:03:51.728 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT NEW TRANSMISSION.

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:52.662 region:rollup2
HOW THE EXISTING TRANSMISSION?

01:03:51.728 --> 01:03:53.663 region:rollup2
AND HOW MUCH OF THE EXISTING

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:55.598 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION WOULD BE MADE

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:56.733 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE WOULD BE IN QUESTION

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:58.635 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH OF THAT WOULD REALLY

01:03:56.733 --> 01:04:00.437 region:rollup2
COME TO THE BROADER ENERGY

01:03:58.635 --> 01:04:02.038 region:rollup2
BALANCE MARKET IF WE EXPANDED TO

01:04:00.437 --> 01:04:03.440 region:rollup2
THE HEAD.

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:04.708 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON THAT IS THAT THEY

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:06.343 region:rollup2
HAVE BILATERAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:08.178 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION THEY SOLD THAT

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:09.979 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION OFF IN.

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:11.047 region:rollup2
HOW THAT TRANSIT BECOMES

01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:11.648 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE DINGY BELTS MARKER THE

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:13.383 region:rollup2
DAY AHEAD?

01:04:11.648 --> 01:04:17.754 region:rollup2
MAYBE IN QUESTION.

01:04:13.383 --> 01:04:18.288 region:rollup2
I SEE THANK YOU.

01:04:17.754 --> 01:04:19.589 region:rollup2

EXPLORA.

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:29.499 region:rollup2
THE MARGINS FOR ERROR ON ON

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:31.134 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS AND GIVEN THE COUPLE

01:04:29.499 --> 01:04:32.769 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SCENARIOS ARE.

01:04:31.134 --> 01:04:33.837 region:rollup2
SO ESSENTIALLY WE'RE USING. A

01:04:32.769 --> 01:04:36.372 region:rollup2
VARIATION OF A SPOT MARKET RIGHT

01:04:33.837 --> 01:04:38.541 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:41.311 region:rollup2
WHICH GIVES YOU A VERY SHORT

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:43.246 region:rollup2
WINDOW TO GET IT RIGHT.

01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:44.414 region:rollup2
THAT THIS RIGHT IF YOU DON'T GET

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:45.582 region:rollup2
IT RIGHT A SHORT WINDOW.

01:04:44.414 --> 01:04:46.916 region:rollup2
WE CAN HAVE SOME UPPER

01:04:45.582 --> 01:04:49.018 region:rollup2
OPERABILITY EN.

01:04:46.916 --> 01:04:50.887 region:rollup2
OTHER SERIOUS PROBLEMS YET

01:04:49.018 --> 01:04:52.789 region:rollup2
SO JUST DANCE ACQUITTAL BUT WE

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:54.290 region:rollup2
START PLANNING THIS ONE DATE

01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:55.091 region:rollup2
ADVANCE YES YOU HAVE THAT WHERE

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:56.993 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:04:55.091 --> 01:04:58.161 region:rollup2
ONE TRY TO GET TO IS.

01:04:56.993 --> 01:04:59.796 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AND A.

01:04:58.161 --> 01:05:01.097 region:rollup2
.

01:04:59.796 --> 01:05:03.066 region:rollup2
AND IMMIGRANT INTEGRATE WESTERN

01:05:01.097 --> 01:05:06.035 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED SYSTEM AND THE SPOT

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:08.371 region:rollup2
MARKET WITH RESPECT TO HOW FAR.

01:05:06.035 --> 01:05:09.739 region:rollup2
YOU YOU COULD GET IN THE

01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:11.374 region:rollup2
PLANNING PROCESS I'VE TAKEN A

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:12.108 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF TOURS WHAT I REALLY

01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:14.144 region:rollup2
LIKE IS HOW YOU'RE ABLE.

PREVIOUS TWENTY FOUR HOURS WITH

01:05:15.512 --> 01:05:18.948 region:rollup2
A BUNCH OF AND PUTS IN A LOT OF.

01:05:17.347 --> 01:05:21.851 region:rollup2
MODELING YOU GET A PRETTY

01:05:18.948 --> 01:05:24.154 region:rollup2
STRAIGHT. THE NEXT DAY WITH THE

01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:25.388 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATIONS OF THE ISSUES.

01:05:24.154 --> 01:05:27.590 region:rollup2
BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:29.993 region:rollup2
US SPOT MARKET TO FIX IT.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:32.162 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAD INTEGRATION AND WE

01:05:29.993 --> 01:05:34.531 region:rollup2
WERE COOPERATIVE.

01:05:32.162 --> 01:05:36.766 region:rollup2
WITH THOUGH WESTERN.

01:05:34.531 --> 01:05:38.735 region:rollup2
WOULD WE BE ABLE TO HAVE.

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:41.037 region:rollup2
RELIABLE TWENTY FOUR HOUR

01:05:38.735 --> 01:05:44.040 region:rollup2
PLANNING THAT WOULD MAKE YOUR

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:45.141 region:rollup2
MARGINS OF ERROR. A LATIN LAST

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:47.210 region:rollup2
SERB.

01:05:45.141 --> 01:05:49.379 region:rollup2
AT CREATION OF INDIGESTION YEAH

01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:50.580 region:rollup2
SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES AND I

01:05:49.379 --> 01:05:53.483 region:rollup2
THINK TO SOMEWHERE IMMENSE

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:55.285 region:rollup2

WHERE YOU NEED TO SUPPORT. OR

01:06:32.188 --> 01:06:36.526 region:rollup2
WHERE TRANSMISSION NEEDS TO BE

U. DO NOT GET THAT YOU NOW WITH

01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:41.664 region:rollup2
JUST A.

01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:43.600 region:rollup2
EXPANDING THE ENERGY IMBALANCE

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:44.501 region:rollup2
MARKET INTO THE DAY AHEAD THOSE

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.669 region:rollup2
OF THE LONGER TERM PLANNING

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:48.171 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:49.239 region:rollup2
SEVEN MAYBE I CAN ADD TO THIS

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:51.241 region:rollup2
WHAT MARK SAYING HERE'S WELL

01:06:49.239 --> 01:06:52.976 region:rollup2
ELECT. MOVE YOUR MICROPHONE A

01:06:51.241 --> 01:06:54.611 region:rollup2
LITTLE CLOSER YES SIR SORRY BOMB

01:06:52.976 --> 01:06:56.145 region:rollup2
GOES GOES TO THE FACT WHAT WOULD

01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:58.114 region:rollup2
WE DO IN THAT DAY AHEAD TIME

01:06:56.145 --> 01:07:00.049 region:rollup2
FRAME. AND EFFECTIVELY WHAT

01:06:58.114 --> 01:07:01.918 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING TODAY IS WE ARE

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:03.753 region:rollup2
RUNNING THE DAY AHEAD MARKET AND

01:07:01.918 --> 01:07:05.855 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING ALL OF THE RESOURCES

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:07.423 region:rollup2
WE NEED. TO RELIABLY SERVE LOW

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:08.925 region:rollup2
THE NEXT DAY BUT AS YOU POINT

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:10.260 region:rollup2
OUT ONE OF THINGS THAT HAPPENS

01:07:08.925 --> 01:07:11.127 region:rollup2
IS DOING DAY AHEAD IN REAL TIME

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:13.663 region:rollup2
IS WE KNOW THINGS ARE GONNA

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:14.564 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE FORECAST COULD BE OFF

01:07:13.663 --> 01:07:16.099 region:rollup2
WE GET OF A FORCED OUTAGE AND SO

01:07:14.564 --> 01:07:17.700 region:rollup2
FORTH. I THINK TO ADD ON TO WHAT

01:07:16.099 --> 01:07:20.236 region:rollup2
MARK IS SAYING IS WHEN YOU THINK

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.537 region:rollup2
ABOUT HAVING A MUCH LARGER

01:07:20.236 --> 01:07:21.871 region:rollup2
FOOTPRINT.

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:23.940 region:rollup2
SUDDENLY WE HAVE ACCESS TO MANY

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:25.842 region:rollup2
MORE RESOURCES A MUCH MORE

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:27.744 region:rollup2
DIVERSE MIX OF RESOURCES

01:07:25.842 --> 01:07:29.779 region:rollup2
TO HELP SET UP THAT DISPATCHED

01:07:27.744 --> 01:07:30.847 region:rollup2
FOR THE FOLLOWING DAY. AND HIS

01:07:29.779 --> 01:07:32.715 region:rollup2
MARKS POINTING OUT OF BACK TO

01:07:30.847 --> 01:07:34.317 region:rollup2
SOME WOMEN QUIRK QUESTION A MUCH

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:35.852 region:rollup2
LARGER TRANSMISSION

01:07:34.317 --> 01:07:37.921 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE. IN ORDER TO

01:07:35.852 --> 01:07:40.557 region:rollup2
ACCESS THOSE RESOURCES SO IN THE

01:07:37.921 --> 01:07:42.892 region:rollup2
END TO YOUR POINT WE END UP WITH

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:44.093 region:rollup2
A MORE RELIABLE DISPATCH COMING

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:45.495 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE DAY AHEAD JUST

01:07:44.093 --> 01:07:47.263 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAVE A LARGER FLEET

01:07:45.495 --> 01:07:48.665 region:rollup2
TO WORK WITH.

01:07:47.263 --> 01:07:50.900 region:rollup2
AND YOU ALSO GET A MORE

01:07:48.665 --> 01:07:52.302 region:rollup2

BECAUSE YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE

01:07:52.302 --> 01:07:55.038 region:rollup2
OF THE FACT THAT.

LET'S SAY THE NORTHWEST THEY

01:07:55.038 --> 01:07:58.341 region:rollup2
PEAK IN THE WINTER WE PEAK IN

01:07:57.573 --> 01:07:59.375 region:rollup2
THE SUMMER. SO THE FACT THAT

01:07:58.341 --> 01:08:01.377 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T PICK AT THE SAME TIME

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:03.346 region:rollup2
YOU CAN NOW GET A BETTER SHARING

01:08:01.377 --> 01:08:04.948 region:rollup2
OF THE DAYS DIVERSE RESOURCES

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:05.915 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT DIVERSITY OF. HOW

01:08:04.948 --> 01:08:07.483 region:rollup2
THE LOAD?

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:08.885 region:rollup2
ATTRACT BUYERS ONE OTHER

01:08:07.483 --> 01:08:10.486 region:rollup2
QUESTION ABOUT.

01:08:08.885 --> 01:08:12.555 region:rollup2
THAT THE OVER PROCUREMENT UPS

01:08:10.486 --> 01:08:13.690 region:rollup2
OF SOME RENEWABLES I THINK IT'S

01:08:12.555 --> 01:08:15.325 region:rollup2
BASICALLY SO IF I'M.

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:16.793 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND OUR UNDERSTANDING IT

01:08:15.325 --> 01:08:18.227 region:rollup2
CORRECTLY YOU GOTTA.

01:08:16.793 --> 01:08:21.631 region:rollup2
PERIOD OF TIME UP THERE WHAT YOU

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:23.366 region:rollup2
GOT TO COULD CURTAIL.

01:08:21.631 --> 01:08:24.534 region:rollup2
IN THAT CURTAILMENT PROCESS HAVE

01:08:23.366 --> 01:08:26.803 region:rollup2
WE BOUGHT THAT ELECTRICITY

01:08:24.534 --> 01:08:28.605 region:rollup2
ALREADY.

01:08:26.803 --> 01:08:30.406 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE THE U. YOU'VE PAID FOR

01:08:28.605 --> 01:08:31.874 region:rollup2
THAT CAPACITY YOU PAY FOR

01:08:30.406 --> 01:08:33.209 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY THROUGH POWER

01:08:31.874 --> 01:08:34.644 region:rollup2
PURCHASE AGREEMENTS REDWOOD SO

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:37.180 region:rollup2
SO WE.

01:08:34.644 --> 01:08:38.848 region:rollup2
WE WE PAY FOR THAT YES.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:40.917 region:rollup2
IS IT IS I MEAN IS IT POSSIBLE

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:43.820 region:rollup2
IN IN IN IN A WESTERN INTEGRATED

01:08:40.917 --> 01:08:45.989 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE. A I GUESS

01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:47.557 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF CURTAILING AYE AYE

01:08:45.989 --> 01:08:49.392 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE DO WITH IT IF I GET

01:08:47.557 --> 01:08:51.961 region:rollup2
IT TO GET RID OF IT. CANNOT BE

01:08:49.392 --> 01:08:54.030 region:rollup2
SENT TO THE REST OF THE YES

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:57.467 region:rollup2
REGION AND COULD IT BE. THAT

01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:57.834 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY PRICED AT A WAY THAT IF

01:08:57.467 --> 01:08:58.668 region:rollup2
WE DIDN'T GET.

01:08:57.834 --> 01:09:00.203 region:rollup2
ALL OF THEM.

01:08:58.668 --> 01:09:01.204 region:rollup2
MONEY BACK THAT WE SPENT A BIKE

01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:02.905 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD GET SOMETHING BACK

01:09:01.204 --> 01:09:04.073 region:rollup2
YES.

01:09:02.905 --> 01:09:06.476 region:rollup2
YOU ARE WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS YOU

01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:08.177 region:rollup2
MAY BE YOU MAY BE SELLING IT OFF

01:09:06.476 --> 01:09:10.046 region:rollup2
AT A LOWER COST BUT.

01:09:08.177 --> 01:09:11.914 region:rollup2
YOU GET TO BENEFITS ONE IS YOU

01:09:10.046 --> 01:09:13.549 region:rollup2
MAY BE DISPLACING OTHER

01:09:11.914 --> 01:09:15.284 region:rollup2
RESOURCES HIGHER COSTS RESOURCES

01:09:13.549 --> 01:09:16.319 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE WEST.

01:09:15.284 --> 01:09:18.021 region:rollup2
YOU MAY BE ABLE STORE THAT

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:18.788 region:rollup2
ENERGY.

01:09:18.021 --> 01:09:20.490 region:rollup2
IN THE HYDRO SYSTEM IN THE

01:09:18.788 --> 01:09:21.991 region:rollup2
NORTHWEST.

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:23.793 region:rollup2
AT WHICH POINT THAT ENERGY WILL

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:25.695 region:rollup2
COME BACK TO YOU WHEN YOU NEED

01:09:23.793 --> 01:09:27.597 region:rollup2
IT FOR THE. ANOTHER PERIOD OF

01:09:25.695 --> 01:09:30.266 region:rollup2
TIME SO YOU FACTUALLY CAN USE

01:09:27.597 --> 01:09:31.934 region:rollup2
THE REST WESTERN GRID AND THE

01:09:30.266 --> 01:09:33.269 region:rollup2
RESOURCE IN THE WESTERN BRED TO

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:34.971 region:rollup2
STORE THAT ENERGY.

01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:36.172 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM IS A STORAGE DEVICE

01:09:34.971 --> 01:09:37.640 region:rollup2
ITSELF I'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF

01:09:36.172 --> 01:09:38.975 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:41.244 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS IN CALIFORNIA

01:09:38.975 --> 01:09:41.711 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE SPENDING QUITE A

01:09:41.244 --> 01:09:43.179 region:rollup2
BIT OF MONEY ON THEIR

01:09:41.711 --> 01:09:45.148 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:47.583 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BASICALLY ASKING MAY

01:09:45.148 --> 01:09:49.352 region:rollup2
WELL IF WE HAVE ALREADY PRE

01:09:47.583 --> 01:09:52.722 region:rollup2
PURCHASED A SIMILAR TRICITY THAT

01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:54.490 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T USE. OF WHY CAN'T OUR

01:09:52.722 --> 01:09:57.960 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS IN OUR

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:59.829 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. RATE PAYERS TAP INTO

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:02.699 region:rollup2
THIS DISCOUNTED.

01:09:59.829 --> 01:10:03.833 region:rollup2
EXTRA AVAILABLE. ELECTRICITY I

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:05.301 region:rollup2
WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE

01:10:03.833 --> 01:10:06.502 region:rollup2
SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING SO I

01:10:05.301 --> 01:10:07.403 region:rollup2
DON'T WANNA.

01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:07.937 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK I WANT TO

01:10:07.403 --> 01:10:10.206 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY GIVEAWAY THAT

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:11.741 region:rollup2
OPTION.

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:12.942 region:rollup2
AND AND AND.

01:10:11.741 --> 01:10:15.511 region:rollup2
BUT I'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO

01:10:12.942 --> 01:10:17.080 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE THAT OPTIONS SO THAT.

01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:19.015 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FOLKS WELL ACTUALLY

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.882 region:rollup2
PLAN ON ELECTRICITY.

01:10:19.015 --> 01:10:21.918 region:rollup2
WRITING THAT'S THAT'S MUCH MORE

01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:24.153 region:rollup2
STABLE AND AND AND AND LESS SO

01:10:21.918 --> 01:10:25.521 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED IS ONE

01:10:24.153 --> 01:10:28.024 region:rollup2
OF THE BENEFITS OF HAVING A

01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:30.827 region:rollup2
MARKET WITH MARKET PRICES.

01:10:28.024 --> 01:10:31.761 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IN THAT MIDDLE THE DAY.

01:10:30.827 --> 01:10:33.763 region:rollup2
WE ARE SETTING PRICES

01:10:31.761 --> 01:10:35.565 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY LOW ZERO DOLLARS OR

01:10:33.763 --> 01:10:37.233 region:rollup2
MAYBE EVEN EIGHT DOLLARS.

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:39.602 region:rollup2
IF YOU WERE ABLE TO TAKE THOSE

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:40.203 region:rollup2
PRICES PLANS HAVE IT TRANSLATED

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:41.137 region:rollup2
WE'RE PAYING PEOPLE TO TAKE IT

01:10:40.203 --> 01:10:42.572 region:rollup2
YES.

01:10:41.137 --> 01:10:44.640 region:rollup2
IF YOU WERE TO PASS OUT THROUGH

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:46.275 region:rollup2
THROUGH A RETAIL RATE STRUCTURE

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:47.744 region:rollup2
THAT RECOGNIZE THAT.

01:10:46.275 --> 01:10:49.445 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE TIME OF USES OR

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:52.315 region:rollup2
DYNAMIC PRICING.

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:54.083 region:rollup2
YOU COULD ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZE.

01:10:52.315 --> 01:10:55.618 region:rollup2
LOADS TO INCREASE AND USE THAT

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:57.186 region:rollup2
ENERGY.

01:10:55.618 --> 01:10:59.422 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY POWERFUL AS YOU

01:10:57.186 --> 01:11:01.324 region:rollup2
WANT TO LEVERAGE THE ELECTRIC

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:03.092 region:rollup2
GRID TO DE CARBONIZED OTHER

01:11:01.324 --> 01:11:04.861 region:rollup2
PARTS OTHER SECTORS

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:06.028 region:rollup2
WHAT CAN YOU DO THAT. CHARGED

01:11:04.861 --> 01:11:08.097 region:rollup2
BATTERIES FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES

01:11:06.028 --> 01:11:11.134 region:rollup2
AT THAT TIME.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:12.401 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHERE THE POWER OF THE.

01:11:11.134 --> 01:11:14.036 region:rollup2
D. CARBONIZED ELECTRIC GRID THEN

01:11:12.401 --> 01:11:16.305 region:rollup2
TRANSPIRES INTO THE CAR NOTHING

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:18.007 region:rollup2
OTHER PARTS OF THE SECTORS I

01:11:16.305 --> 01:11:19.408 region:rollup2
DOUBT I ACTUALLY THINK THAT.

01:11:18.007 --> 01:11:20.409 region:rollup2
REGIONALIZATION IS GOING TO BE

01:11:19.408 --> 01:11:22.378 region:rollup2
A CALIFORNIA WANTS TO BE A

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:23.546 region:rollup2
LEGACY LEADER IN ALL OF THIS AND

01:11:22.378 --> 01:11:24.981 region:rollup2
I ACTUALLY THINK IF WE REGIONAL

01:11:23.546 --> 01:11:26.282 region:rollup2
EYES THERE'S. AND I I WANNA HEAR

01:11:24.981 --> 01:11:27.517 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION AND OTHERS WHO

01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:29.785 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THIS

01:11:27.517 --> 01:11:31.354 region:rollup2
BUT IT WOULD SEEM TO ME. THAT

01:11:29.785 --> 01:11:33.389 region:rollup2
THE THAT IF WE HAD THIS.

01:11:31.354 --> 01:11:35.925 region:rollup2
REGIONAL A REVITALIZED A FULLY

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:38.060 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED MARKET. THAT MARKET

01:11:35.925 --> 01:11:40.530 region:rollup2
FORCES BECAUSE CALIFORNIA. IS

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:43.166 region:rollup2
SUCH A BROAD LARGE.

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:44.433 region:rollup2
USER THAT OUR PREFERENCES MIGHT

01:11:43.166 --> 01:11:46.836 region:rollup2
VERY WELL.

01:11:44.433 --> 01:11:48.638 region:rollup2
ENGAGE AN INCENTIVE FIVE THE

01:11:46.836 --> 01:11:49.372 region:rollup2
OTHER UP PARTICIPANTS.

01:11:48.638 --> 01:11:51.240 region:rollup2
.

01:11:49.372 --> 01:11:53.009 region:rollup2
TWO UP.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.710 region:rollup2
PROCURING CERTAIN WAYS BECAUSE

01:11:53.009 --> 01:11:56.979 region:rollup2
THE MARKET IN CALIFORNIA WOULD

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:59.348 region:rollup2
BE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN IT AS

01:11:56.979 --> 01:12:00.917 region:rollup2
WELL. IS THAT. A WAY WE CAN SHIP

01:11:59.348 --> 01:12:04.020 region:rollup2
OUR.

01:12:00.917 --> 01:12:05.822 region:rollup2
ENERGY LEGACY EAST.

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:07.557 region:rollup2
YO YOU WHAT YOU GET IS THEN THE

01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:09.058 region:rollup2
BENEFIT OF.

01:12:07.557 --> 01:12:10.993 region:rollup2
SHARE OUR RESOURCES AND SHARE

01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:12.762 region:rollup2
OUR CLEAN RESOURCES YOU CAN

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:14.297 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HELP DE CARBONIZED

01:12:12.762 --> 01:12:15.464 region:rollup2
OTHER SECTORS OF THE WEST.

01:12:14.297 --> 01:12:16.065 region:rollup2
AND JUST TO ILLUSTRATE THAT

01:12:15.464 --> 01:12:17.934 region:rollup2
POINT.

01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:19.602 region:rollup2
.

01:12:17.934 --> 01:12:20.937 region:rollup2
THREE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND

01:12:19.602 --> 01:12:22.471 region:rollup2
AND.

01:12:20.937 --> 01:12:24.740 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN.

01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:26.242 region:rollup2
WE REDUCE CARBON REDUCTION FROM

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:27.977 region:rollup2
THE AYE ESOS DISPATCH BY TWENTY

01:12:26.242 --> 01:12:29.145 region:rollup2
THREE PERCENT.

01:12:27.977 --> 01:12:30.479 region:rollup2
NOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT THAT'S

01:12:29.145 --> 01:12:31.514 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF ENERGY IMBALANCE

01:12:30.479 --> 01:12:33.482 region:rollup2
MARKET SOLELY I MEAN IT'S

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:36.219 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE. WE WERE

01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:38.988 region:rollup2
INTEGRATING MORE RENEWABLES AND.

01:12:36.219 --> 01:12:39.555 region:rollup2
FOR A LOOK AT PACIFIC CORE.

01:12:38.988 --> 01:12:40.823 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING IN JIM BOUNCE

01:12:39.555 --> 01:12:42.225 region:rollup2
MARKET.

01:12:40.823 --> 01:12:43.226 region:rollup2
FROM THE TIME THAT THEY STARTED

01:12:42.225 --> 01:12:44.994 region:rollup2
THE ENERGY AMOUNTS MARKET. THERE

01:12:43.226 --> 01:12:47.997 region:rollup2
WERE.

01:12:44.994 --> 01:12:49.398 region:rollup2
GHG REDUCTION WENT EL WAS ABOUT

01:12:47.997 --> 01:12:51.968 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN PERCENT OVER THE SAME

01:12:49.398 --> 01:12:54.203 region:rollup2
PERIOD TIME.

01:12:51.968 --> 01:12:55.905 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT ILLUSTRATES HOW.

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:57.406 region:rollup2
HAVING A COORDINATED MARKET

01:12:55.905 --> 01:12:59.742 region:rollup2
WOULD ALLOW US TO HELP DE

01:12:57.406 --> 01:13:00.309 region:rollup2
CARBONIZED AND MAKE BETTER USE

01:12:59.742 --> 01:13:01.544 region:rollup2
OF ALL THE RESOURCES IN THE

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:03.379 region:rollup2
WEST.

01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:04.380 region:rollup2
AND HELP DE CARBONIZED THE WEST.

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:06.749 region:rollup2
SEEM TO ME THAT WOULD ALSO BE

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:08.184 region:rollup2
PRESSURES ON ON PRICES IS WELL

01:13:06.749 --> 01:13:09.619 region:rollup2
TOMORROW BLOOM LANDING WE'RE

01:13:08.184 --> 01:13:10.386 region:rollup2
GONNA GET IT FOR LESS PRICES AND

01:13:09.619 --> 01:13:12.188 region:rollup2
YET THEY'RE NOT GETTING A BIT

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:12.788 region:rollup2
NAM THEY'RE NOT GETTING IT JUST

01:13:12.188 --> 01:13:14.757 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S CLEAN RESOURCES

01:13:12.788 --> 01:13:17.426 region:rollup2
GETTING BECAUSE ECONOMIC ENERGY.

01:13:14.757 --> 01:13:20.896 region:rollup2
AND. I WE CAN BE. A CALL

01:13:17.426 --> 01:13:21.664 region:rollup2
RESOURCE WITH OUR CLEAN ENERGY

01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:22.999 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MARGINAL COST ZERO.

01:13:21.664 --> 01:13:24.300 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A HIGHER MARGINAL COST

01:13:22.999 --> 01:13:25.768 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A FEW COST WE CAN BEAT

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:27.069 region:rollup2
THAT CAN.

01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:27.703 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:27.904 region:rollup2
THE PRESENTATIONS CHAIRMAN THANK

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:40.016 region:rollup2
THIS CONVERSATION AND I'VE BEEN

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:41.317 region:rollup2
A CONSCIOUS WITHOUT LEGISLATOR

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:43.986 region:rollup2
FROM. SOME OF THESE MARTA

01:13:41.317 --> 01:13:45.388 region:rollup2
EASTERN STATES AND.

01:13:43.986 --> 01:13:46.589 region:rollup2
THEY TALK A LOT ABOUT CARTMAN.

01:13:45.388 --> 01:13:47.123 region:rollup2
VERY LITTLE ABOUT THAT OTHER

01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:49.592 region:rollup2
THING SO IT'S GONNA BE

01:13:47.123 --> 01:13:51.460 region:rollup2
INTERESTING AS WE GO FORWARD.

01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:52.962 region:rollup2
ARM. IN AND BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:54.530 region:rollup2
PROTECTIVE OF THEIR THEIR JOBS

01:13:52.962 --> 01:13:56.065 region:rollup2
AND JOB MARKET AND AND

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:58.668 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL ECONOMY IF YOU WILL.

01:13:56.065 --> 01:13:59.835 region:rollup2
UP SO AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE TO

01:13:58.668 --> 01:14:01.837 region:rollup2
WITH OUR.

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:03.172 region:rollup2
NO CREATE CREATE MARKETS AND

01:14:01.837 --> 01:14:05.241 region:rollup2
VALUES THAT REFLECT OUR GOALS

01:14:03.172 --> 01:14:06.542 region:rollup2
AND OUR VALUES.

01:14:05.241 --> 01:14:08.144 region:rollup2
WE EXPAND THAT PIE TO MORE

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:09.378 region:rollup2
REGIONAL WAY.

01:14:08.144 --> 01:14:11.347 region:rollup2
I'M JUST WONDERING YOUR YOUR

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:13.649 region:rollup2
IMPRESSION OF THE IMPACT THEN ON

01:14:11.347 --> 01:14:15.751 region:rollup2
OUR ON OUR OUR JOB ECONOMY.

01:14:13.649 --> 01:14:16.852 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA AS WE CONTINUE TO

01:14:15.751 --> 01:14:18.287 region:rollup2
EXPAND OTHER STATES RIGHT WOULD

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:19.689 region:rollup2
MAKE THINGS MORE AFFORDABLE.

01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:21.357 region:rollup2
WHAT THEN DOES THAT DO? FOR OUR

01:14:19.689 --> 01:14:24.293 region:rollup2
LOCAL.

01:14:21.357 --> 01:14:26.062 region:rollup2
JOB ECONOMY AS IT RELATES TO.

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:26.329 region:rollup2
ALTERNATE ENERGY YEAH I'LL TAKE

01:14:26.062 --> 01:14:28.664 region:rollup2
THIS ONE.

01:14:26.329 --> 01:14:29.865 region:rollup2
IS A EXCELLENT QUESTION AND ONE

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:31.600 region:rollup2
THAT WAS TEED UP IN S. B. THREE

01:14:29.865 --> 01:14:33.970 region:rollup2
FIFTY AND SO IN THE ANALYSIS

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:35.404 region:rollup2
THAT WE DID. WHAT WE FOUND IS

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:38.374 region:rollup2
PART OF WHAT'S COMING OUT OF

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:39.742 region:rollup2
THIS OVERALL ECONOMIC BENEFIT OF

01:14:38.374 --> 01:14:40.476 region:rollup2
HAVING A REGIONAL MARKET?

01:14:39.742 --> 01:14:42.878 region:rollup2
IS LOWER ENERGY PRICES FOR

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:44.413 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CONSUMER.

01:14:42.878 --> 01:14:46.949 region:rollup2
AND WOULD THAT THEN DOES IS

01:14:44.413 --> 01:14:48.751 region:rollup2
CREATES AN ECONOMIC ENGINE TO

01:14:46.949 --> 01:14:50.152 region:rollup2
CREATE ADDITIONAL JOBS.

01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:51.887 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WE FOUND

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:52.955 region:rollup2
ANOTHER SECTORS INTO IT WELL

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:54.357 region:rollup2
IT'S SPREAD ACROSS DIFFERENT

01:14:52.955 --> 01:14:55.891 region:rollup2
SECTORS AND FAIR ENOUGH IT DOES

01:14:54.357 --> 01:14:57.460 region:rollup2
AFFECT DIFFERENT SECTORS IN

01:14:55.891 --> 01:14:59.095 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS. RIGHT WITH THE

01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:00.997 region:rollup2
OVERALL NET BENEFIT OF HAVING

01:14:59.095 --> 01:15:02.698 region:rollup2
THE REGIONAL IS AN INCREASE IN

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:03.532 region:rollup2
JOBS FOR CALIFORNIA IN ITS FAIR

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:05.034 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TO SAY THAT AFFECTS

01:15:03.532 --> 01:15:06.102 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SECTORS.

01:15:05.034 --> 01:15:07.670 region:rollup2
ONE OTHER INTERESTING THINGS

01:15:06.102 --> 01:15:10.306 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT IS HAVING THAT LOWER

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:11.574 region:rollup2
COST FOR ENERGY ACTUALLY HAD THE

01:15:10.306 --> 01:15:13.175 region:rollup2
INCREASE BENEFIT TO

01:15:11.574 --> 01:15:14.377 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:16.012 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEIR ENERGY BILLS SUCH

01:15:14.377 --> 01:15:18.114 region:rollup2
A LARGE PORTION OF THEIR TOTAL

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:19.882 region:rollup2
INCOME REDUCING THAT COST TO

01:15:18.114 --> 01:15:21.050 region:rollup2
THEM HAD A MUCH BIGGER BENEFIT

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:23.185 region:rollup2
TO THEM IT WAS AT LEAST A TEN

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:25.688 region:rollup2
PERCENT BIGGER VALUE. IN TERMS

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:26.322 region:rollup2
OF WHAT IT DID FOR THEM AND

01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:26.956 region:rollup2
CREATING MORE VALUE AND WORTH TO

01:15:26.322 --> 01:15:28.391 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:15:26.956 --> 01:15:30.192 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WHAT WE DID IN THAT

01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:31.894 region:rollup2
ANNOUNCES DEFYING THAT YES THERE

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:33.863 region:rollup2
IS AFFECT ON JOBS IN DIFFERENT

01:15:31.894 --> 01:15:35.398 region:rollup2
SECTORS BUT OVERALL THERE'S A

01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:36.365 region:rollup2
NET INCREASE IN JOBS ACROSS THE

01:15:35.398 --> 01:15:39.802 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE.

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:42.204 region:rollup2
THEY WATCH.

01:15:39.802 --> 01:15:43.305 region:rollup2
.

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:45.341 region:rollup2
BECAUSE RISK.

01:15:43.305 --> 01:15:46.809 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:15:45.341 --> 01:15:49.278 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF YOUR PRESENTATION

01:15:46.809 --> 01:15:51.313 region:rollup2
INITIALLY YOU INDICATED THAT.

01:15:49.278 --> 01:15:53.082 region:rollup2
REGIONALIZATION IS AN EFFECTIVE

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:55.151 region:rollup2
SOLUTION.

01:15:53.082 --> 01:15:57.153 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT THE ONLY SOLUTION.

01:15:55.151 --> 01:15:58.053 region:rollup2
WHAT OTHER SOLUTIONS ARE THERE?

01:15:57.153 --> 01:16:01.791 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK GOING BACK TO THIS.

01:15:58.053 --> 01:16:03.793 region:rollup2
.

01:16:01.791 --> 01:16:04.393 region:rollup2
THE SAID TABLE.

01:16:03.793 --> 01:16:05.027 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING I DON'T I SAY IT'S

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:06.495 region:rollup2
NOT THE ONLY SOLUTION BECAUSE I

01:16:05.027 --> 01:16:08.431 region:rollup2
THINK THE.

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:09.799 region:rollup2
I CHALLENGES GREATER THAN ANY

01:16:08.431 --> 01:16:11.901 region:rollup2
ONE SOLUTION.

01:16:09.799 --> 01:16:15.070 region:rollup2
PROVIDES THE BENEFIT FOR SO IN

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:16.705 region:rollup2
OTHER WORDS.

01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:18.707 region:rollup2
IF I'VE A THIRTEEN THOUSAND

01:16:16.705 --> 01:16:19.341 region:rollup2
MEGAWATT JUST BENEATH CHO HAVE A

01:16:18.707 --> 01:16:19.608 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN THOUSAND A WHAT RAMPING

01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:21.911 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:16:19.608 --> 01:16:23.612 region:rollup2
I MAY BE ABLE SOLVE A PORTION OF

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:25.381 region:rollup2
THAT THROUGH REGIONALIZATION.

01:16:23.612 --> 01:16:26.882 region:rollup2
BUT MAYBE I CAN SOLVE THE OTHER

01:16:25.381 --> 01:16:27.783 region:rollup2
PORTION WITH.

01:16:26.882 --> 01:16:29.785 region:rollup2
THREE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF

01:16:27.783 --> 01:16:31.287 region:rollup2
STORAGE DEVICES.

01:16:29.785 --> 01:16:33.022 region:rollup2
MAYBE FIVE MILLION ELECTRIC

01:16:31.287 --> 01:16:34.356 region:rollup2
VEHICLES WHICH TRANSLATES INTO

01:16:33.022 --> 01:16:36.459 region:rollup2
ABOUT THREE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS

01:16:34.356 --> 01:16:38.227 region:rollup2
OF ADDITIONAL STORAGE MAYBE THAT

01:16:36.459 --> 01:16:39.929 region:rollup2
CAN HELP PROVIDE SOME OF THE.

01:16:38.227 --> 01:16:40.429 region:rollup2
SOLUTION.

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:42.932 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE TO DO SMART

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:43.499 region:rollup2
CHARGING.

01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:43.799 region:rollup2
WITH THAT THAT THE RATES IN

01:16:43.499 --> 01:16:45.367 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE.

01:16:43.799 --> 01:16:47.403 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THAT.

01:16:45.367 --> 01:16:49.138 region:rollup2
.

01:16:47.403 --> 01:16:51.040 region:rollup2
TIME OF USE RATES IF WE CAN GET

01:16:49.138 --> 01:16:52.741 region:rollup2
THE MAN IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:55.344 region:rollup2
ELSEWHERE ACROSS THE WEST TO

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:57.313 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BE RESPONSIVE TO THE

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:59.014 region:rollup2
PRICES IN THE SYSTEM CONDITIONS.

01:16:57.313 --> 01:17:00.382 region:rollup2
YOU COULD ACTUALLY HAVE TIMES

01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:02.118 region:rollup2
WHERE WE WANT TO HAVE THEM

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:03.419 region:rollup2
REDUCE LOW DURING THAT EVENING

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:04.687 region:rollup2
RAMP.

01:17:03.419 --> 01:17:06.188 region:rollup2
OTHER TIMES WHEN WE HAVE TOO

01:17:04.687 --> 01:17:07.256 region:rollup2
MUCH SUPPLY THAT'S WHEN WE

01:17:06.188 --> 01:17:08.757 region:rollup2
SHOULD ACTUALLY BE RAMPING UP

01:17:07.256 --> 01:17:10.693 region:rollup2
THEIR LOAD INCREASING THEIR

01:17:08.757 --> 01:17:11.427 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION. OF WIDGETS OR

01:17:10.693 --> 01:17:13.195 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THEY'RE MAKING

01:17:11.427 --> 01:17:14.163 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURING AT THAT TIME A

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:17.333 region:rollup2
VERY LOW COST.

01:17:14.163 --> 01:17:18.434 region:rollup2
OF ENERGY.

01:17:17.333 --> 01:17:20.569 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO HAVE THE RENEWABLES

01:17:18.434 --> 01:17:21.971 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES.

01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:23.272 region:rollup2
I KNOW THE RENEWABLE GOAL IS IN

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:24.840 region:rollup2
TERMS OF RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO

01:17:23.272 --> 01:17:26.609 region:rollup2
STANDARD RENEWABLE ENERGY THAT'S

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:27.676 region:rollup2
THE MEASURE.

01:17:26.609 --> 01:17:29.478 region:rollup2
BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE THE

01:17:27.676 --> 01:17:30.513 region:rollup2
RENEWABLES NOW STEP BACK AND SAY

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:32.148 region:rollup2
THERE'S TIMES WHERE WE DON'T

01:17:30.513 --> 01:17:33.883 region:rollup2
WANT HIM TO PRODUCE ENERGY. WE

01:17:32.148 --> 01:17:35.184 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WANT HIM TO HOLD BACK

01:17:33.883 --> 01:17:37.419 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN GET SOME OF THE

01:17:35.184 --> 01:17:39.088 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL RELIABILITY SERVICES.

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:41.490 region:rollup2
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO RELY AS MUCH

01:17:39.088 --> 01:17:43.225 region:rollup2
ON THE GAS RESOURCES FOR THOSE

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:44.260 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL RELIABILITY SERVICES.

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:46.729 region:rollup2
AND THAT WOULD BE A HELP PART OF

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:49.465 region:rollup2
THE SOLUTION.

01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:51.333 region:rollup2
SO THOSE OF THE OTHER SUITE OF

01:17:49.465 --> 01:17:52.234 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS AND I I GOT A POINT.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:54.670 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS INCREDIBLY

01:17:52.234 --> 01:17:55.971 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE.

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:58.707 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF INNOVATIVE

01:17:55.971 --> 01:18:00.709 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS I'VE SEEN AND HEARD.

01:17:58.707 --> 01:18:02.411 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE BEST PLACE YOU CAN

01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:04.713 region:rollup2
HAVE TO DEVELOP THOSE INNOVATIVE

01:18:02.411 --> 01:18:06.682 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS WE LOOK FORWARD TO

01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:07.883 region:rollup2
DIVERT HELPING DEVELOP THOSE AND

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:10.052 region:rollup2
SHOW HOW THAT THAT THIS CAN BE

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:10.686 region:rollup2
DONE. NOT JUST FOR CALIFORNIA

01:18:10.052 --> 01:18:12.354 region:rollup2
BUT SHOW HOW CAN BE DONE FOR THE

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:13.489 region:rollup2
WEST.

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:14.823 region:rollup2
IN A I THINK I'LL JUST ADD TO

01:18:13.489 --> 01:18:16.191 region:rollup2
THAT BY SAYING IF YOU GO BACK TO

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:17.860 region:rollup2
ONE OF MARC SLIDES WERE TALKED

01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:18.427 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW THE NGUYEN DISAPPEARED

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:19.895 region:rollup2
AS SOME IN THE COURT POINTED

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:20.963 region:rollup2
OUT.

01:18:19.895 --> 01:18:22.431 region:rollup2
WHEN THINGS YOU SEE ABOUT

01:18:20.963 --> 01:18:25.334 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THIS WE TO SOLUTIONS

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:26.435 region:rollup2
IS THEN THE DIVERSIFICATION. OF

01:18:25.334 --> 01:18:28.137 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES THAT WERE RELYING

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:30.172 region:rollup2
ON SO IT'S NOT JUST WIND AND

01:18:28.137 --> 01:18:32.208 region:rollup2
SOLAR IT'S ACTUALLY RELYING ON

01:18:30.172 --> 01:18:33.842 region:rollup2
THESE THINGS AS OTHER WAYS TO

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.743 region:rollup2
BALANCE LOW TO RESOURCES.

01:18:33.842 --> 01:18:36.278 region:rollup2
BY THE WAY WE TALK ABOUT

01:18:34.743 --> 01:18:38.147 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:18:36.278 --> 01:18:40.382 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGICAL DIVERSITY AND

01:18:38.147 --> 01:18:42.585 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSITY SO IT

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:45.020 region:rollup2
MATTERS WHERE THE RESOURCES ARE

01:18:42.585 --> 01:18:46.455 region:rollup2
AT. FOR EXAMPLE THE WIND IN

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:48.591 region:rollup2
WYOMING OR NEW MEXICO.

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:49.692 region:rollup2
IT ACTION MATTERS WHAT TYPE OF

01:18:48.591 --> 01:18:50.292 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY SOME OF THE SHOULD BE

01:18:49.692 --> 01:18:52.661 region:rollup2
GEOTHERMAL SOME OF THE SHOULD

01:18:50.292 --> 01:18:54.396 region:rollup2
BE.

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:55.598 region:rollup2
WIN SOME OF US SHOULD BE SOLAR.

01:18:54.396 --> 01:18:58.400 region:rollup2
THE DIVERSITY RESOURCES WILL

01:18:55.598 --> 01:19:00.669 region:rollup2
HELP FILL IN THAT SHAPE OF LOAD.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:02.871 region:rollup2
IF IT'S ALL ONE RESOURCE YOU'LL

01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:03.973 region:rollup2
JUST GET THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.

01:19:02.871 --> 01:19:05.774 region:rollup2
LOAD COVERED IN FACT HOPE TO

01:19:03.973 --> 01:19:07.109 region:rollup2
MUCH SUPPLY AND USE YOU'LL MISS

01:19:05.774 --> 01:19:09.745 region:rollup2
THE PERIODS OF TIME WHEN THE SUN

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:11.714 region:rollup2
GOES DOWN.

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:14.416 region:rollup2
IN THE END IT.

01:19:11.714 --> 01:19:16.151 region:rollup2
IN A REGIONAL REGIONAL LIES GRID

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:17.653 region:rollup2
AS ENERGY IS SHARED. OR THE

01:19:16.151 --> 01:19:19.888 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITS

01:19:17.653 --> 01:19:24.827 region:rollup2
REGARDING TRACKING THE

01:19:19.888 --> 01:19:27.062 region:rollup2
DISPATCHED ENERGY.

01:19:24.827 --> 01:19:29.064 region:rollup2
I MF SUMMER EXAMPLE CALIFORNIA

01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:31.700 region:rollup2
HAS A HIGHER STANDARD.

01:19:29.064 --> 01:19:32.968 region:rollup2
THING UTAH. CLEARLY.

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:35.404 region:rollup2
BUT BEFORE SHARING THE

01:19:32.968 --> 01:19:37.840 region:rollup2
DISPATCHED ENERGY CAN WE SURE

01:19:35.404 --> 01:19:39.241 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT WE'RE USING.

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:41.377 region:rollup2
COME THROUGH ZERO OR LIMITED THE

01:19:39.241 --> 01:19:43.145 region:rollup2
MISSION SOURCE.

01:19:41.377 --> 01:19:45.114 region:rollup2
REGIONALIZATION AND HAVING THE

01:19:43.145 --> 01:19:47.449 region:rollup2
VISIBILITY INTO THE SPECIFIC

01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:49.318 region:rollup2
RESOURCES PROVIDES A PATHWAY FOR

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:51.553 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO DO THAT.

01:19:49.318 --> 01:19:53.756 region:rollup2
MORE THAN THE EXISTING METHOD

01:19:51.553 --> 01:19:54.390 region:rollup2
DOES AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE

01:19:53.756 --> 01:19:56.091 region:rollup2
WHEN I TELL YOU WHEN I TELL YOU

01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:56.625 region:rollup2
THERE'S.

01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:57.826 region:rollup2
TEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:59.928 region:rollup2
IMPORTS

01:19:57.826 --> 01:20:01.597 region:rollup2
A LARGE PORTION OF THOSE IMPORTS

01:19:59.928 --> 01:20:03.799 region:rollup2
ARE UNSPECIFIED RESOURCES.

01:20:01.597 --> 01:20:05.367 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW TODAY WHAT IS

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:07.102 region:rollup2
BEHIND THEM.

01:20:05.367 --> 01:20:09.238 region:rollup2
IT MAY BE HYDRO IN MAY BE.

01:20:07.102 --> 01:20:10.439 region:rollup2
GAS.

01:20:09.238 --> 01:20:12.441 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW WELL BEHIND THEM IT

01:20:10.439 --> 01:20:14.576 region:rollup2
MAY BE COOL.

01:20:12.441 --> 01:20:16.278 region:rollup2
UNDER REGIONALIZATION WE WOULD

01:20:14.576 --> 01:20:17.746 region:rollup2
PUT IN A TRACKING SYSTEM THAT

01:20:16.278 --> 01:20:19.214 region:rollup2
WOULD BE MORE RESOURCE SPECIFIC

01:20:17.746 --> 01:20:21.517 region:rollup2
BASED.

01:20:19.214 --> 01:20:22.584 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO DETERMINE

01:20:21.517 --> 01:20:23.986 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO THE WAY WE DO AND

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:25.888 region:rollup2
ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET AND ALL

01:20:23.986 --> 01:20:27.756 region:rollup2
ADMIT THEN YOU BOUNCE MARKET WAS

01:20:25.888 --> 01:20:28.691 region:rollup2
A LEARNING. OPPORTUNITY THERE

01:20:27.756 --> 01:20:30.426 region:rollup2
SOME ENHANCEMENTS THAT WE NEED

01:20:28.691 --> 01:20:33.329 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE TO DO. BUT IT

01:20:30.426 --> 01:20:35.964 region:rollup2
PROVIDES A PATHWAY FOR TRACKING.

01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:38.133 region:rollup2
RESOURCE. DELIVERIES TO SERVE

01:20:35.964 --> 01:20:40.169 region:rollup2
LOAN CALIFORNIA AND THAT ALLOWS

01:20:38.133 --> 01:20:42.137 region:rollup2
US TO TRACK WHAT IS SERVING OUR

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:43.172 region:rollup2
LOW.

01:20:42.137 --> 01:20:44.840 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN ALL AT FROM A

01:20:43.172 --> 01:20:46.275 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL STANDPOINT WHAT

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:49.445 region:rollup2
HAPPENS WITH THE MULTI STATE I

01:20:46.275 --> 01:20:51.280 region:rollup2
SO IS NOW WE ARE OPERATING EVERY

01:20:49.445 --> 01:20:53.182 region:rollup2
GENERATOR AND WE KNOW WHAT EVERY

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:55.017 region:rollup2
GENERATOR IS DOING WITHIN THAT

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:56.919 region:rollup2
FOOTPRINT. WHEN WE LOOK AT TO

01:20:55.017 --> 01:20:58.787 region:rollup2
HOW E. I. M. IS STRUCTURED THE

01:20:56.919 --> 01:21:01.056 region:rollup2
AYE AMENITIES HAVE AN OPTION TO

01:20:58.787 --> 01:21:02.691 region:rollup2
ELECT. WHICH RESOURCES THEY WANT

01:21:01.056 --> 01:21:04.493 region:rollup2
TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT MARKET.

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:07.062 region:rollup2
AND SO HAD A VERY SIMPLE WAY TO

01:21:04.493 --> 01:21:08.997 region:rollup2
ANSWER QUESTION YOU GET. ALMOST

01:21:07.062 --> 01:21:10.032 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED PERCENT TRANSPARENCY

01:21:08.997 --> 01:21:12.234 region:rollup2
IN KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT

01:21:10.032 --> 01:21:14.937 region:rollup2
GENERATORS ARE RUNNING BECAUSE

01:21:12.234 --> 01:21:16.872 region:rollup2
NOW THE SYSTEM OPERATOR SEES

01:21:14.937 --> 01:21:18.273 region:rollup2
WHAT EACH UNIT IS DOING.

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:19.975 region:rollup2
I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT THIS IS

01:21:18.273 --> 01:21:21.276 region:rollup2
THIS QUESTION IS LIKE.

01:21:19.975 --> 01:21:23.879 region:rollup2
COMPLEX SOLUTION.

01:21:21.276 --> 01:21:26.448 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:28.350 region:rollup2
WHY WE TRACKED THE GHG CONTENT

01:21:26.448 --> 01:21:29.585 region:rollup2
TO SERVE CALIFORNIA LOAD? I ALSO

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:31.053 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE RESPECTFUL OF THAT

01:21:29.585 --> 01:21:32.554 region:rollup2
THE OTHER STATES ARE NOT

01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:33.188 region:rollup2
TRACKING THAT OR MAY NOT HAVE

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:38.026 region:rollup2
THE SAME FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE

01:21:33.188 --> 01:21:39.995 region:rollup2
I HAVE

01:21:38.026 --> 01:21:41.830 region:rollup2
TO MAKING SURE THAT.

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:43.332 region:rollup2
THERE LOW AND THERE OUGHT TO

01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:46.668 region:rollup2
THEIR GENERATION IT'S SERVING

01:21:43.332 --> 01:21:47.703 region:rollup2
THEIR LOAD. IS NOT.

01:21:46.668 --> 01:21:50.539 region:rollup2
FACTORING IN THE JEEP SHE

01:21:47.703 --> 01:21:52.775 region:rollup2
CONTENT BUT THE CALIFORNIA LOAD.

01:21:50.539 --> 01:21:54.143 region:rollup2
AND HOW WE SERVE THAT IS

01:21:52.775 --> 01:21:55.077 region:rollup2
FACTORING THE JEEP SHE CONTENT

01:21:54.143 --> 01:21:57.579 region:rollup2
THAT MAKES A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:21:55.077 --> 01:22:00.115 region:rollup2
COMPLEX AND MAKES A LITTLE MORE

01:21:57.579 --> 01:22:01.483 region:rollup2
A CHALLENGING TO SOLVE. BUT I

01:22:00.115 --> 01:22:02.985 region:rollup2
WILL SAY THE RELATION BECAUSE

01:22:01.483 --> 01:22:04.153 region:rollup2
YOU'RE DOING RESOURCE PACIFIC IT

01:22:02.985 --> 01:22:05.220 region:rollup2
ALLOWS FOR BETTER TRACKING

01:22:04.153 --> 01:22:06.889 region:rollup2
METHOD.

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:08.991 region:rollup2
TO SERVE CALIFORNIA.

01:22:06.889 --> 01:22:10.125 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY THERE WERE TWO

01:22:08.991 --> 01:22:11.860 region:rollup2
COMMENTS YOU MADE AND I THINK

01:22:10.125 --> 01:22:13.796 region:rollup2
LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING MORE

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:15.731 region:rollup2
OF THAT TURNED. HEARING MORE

01:22:13.796 --> 01:22:17.332 region:rollup2
PROOF OF THAT.

01:22:15.731 --> 01:22:18.834 region:rollup2
YOU BY REGIONALIZATION USE THAT

01:22:17.332 --> 01:22:20.769 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CAN DE CARBONIZED

01:22:18.834 --> 01:22:22.671 region:rollup2
OTHER AREAS OF THE WEST.

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:24.540 region:rollup2
I HOPE AND OTHER SECTORS.

01:22:22.671 --> 01:22:26.875 region:rollup2
YES AND THE OTHER THAT WE CAN BE

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:29.378 region:rollup2
CARBONIZED ENERGY PRICES THOSE

01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:30.646 region:rollup2
ARE TWO STATEMENTS ARE MADE AND.

01:22:29.378 --> 01:22:31.780 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT STATEMENTS MIGHT LOOK

01:22:30.646 --> 01:22:33.649 region:rollup2
FORWARD TO HEARING AND SEEING

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:36.318 region:rollup2
MORE OF THAT

01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:37.553 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE SHOW.

01:22:36.318 --> 01:22:38.420 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SIR IS HERE MISTER

01:22:37.553 --> 01:22:40.122 region:rollup2
CHAIR THANK YOU RENEWABLE

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:41.723 region:rollup2
PORTFOLIO DIVERSITY IS ONE OF

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:43.125 region:rollup2
THE UP BOXES YOU HAVE THERE IN

01:22:41.723 --> 01:22:46.028 region:rollup2
ADDITION TO THAT IS.

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:47.262 region:rollup2
FLEXIBLE RESOURCES AND.

01:22:46.028 --> 01:22:48.964 region:rollup2
TO BE BY NO SURPRISE OR NO.

01:22:47.262 --> 01:22:51.800 region:rollup2
SECRET THAT MY INTERESTS IS TO

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:52.601 region:rollup2
SEE. A THESE TYPES OF FLEXIBLE

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.603 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AS YOU MENTIONED.

01:22:52.601 --> 01:22:56.438 region:rollup2
SPREAD OUT.

01:22:54.603 --> 01:22:58.640 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS.

01:22:56.438 --> 01:23:00.976 region:rollup2
AND QUITE FRANKLY LOOKING AT IT

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:03.078 region:rollup2
FROM PERSPECTIVE BEFORE WE EVEN

01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:05.280 region:rollup2
GO OUTSIDE OF THE STATE.

01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:07.082 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE WE DOING TO MAXIMIZE

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:08.684 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITIES WITH IN

01:23:07.082 --> 01:23:10.219 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND I REPRESENT AN

01:23:08.684 --> 01:23:11.987 region:rollup2
AREA WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

01:23:10.219 --> 01:23:14.122 region:rollup2
OF FLEXIBLE RESOURCES?

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:15.691 region:rollup2
OUT IN THE SONGS HE AREA.

01:23:14.122 --> 01:23:17.793 region:rollup2
THAT OF DEBATE AND DISCUSSION

01:23:15.691 --> 01:23:19.294 region:rollup2
FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW. HAS BEEN

01:23:17.793 --> 01:23:22.231 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE INTEGRATE.

01:23:19.294 --> 01:23:24.533 region:rollup2
THAT RENEWABLE ENERGY AT TO

01:23:22.231 --> 01:23:25.534 region:rollup2
THIS PORTFOLIO A DIVERSITY THAT

01:23:24.533 --> 01:23:27.603 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CAN YOU

01:23:25.534 --> 01:23:30.906 region:rollup2
MAYBE ELABORATE A BIT. ON THAT

01:23:27.603 --> 01:23:32.107 region:rollup2
IF A FLEXIBLE RESOURCES.

01:23:30.906 --> 01:23:33.342 region:rollup2
YOU ARE LOOKING AT THESE TYPES

01:23:32.107 --> 01:23:35.511 region:rollup2
OF RENEWAL THOUSAND DIFFERENT

01:23:33.342 --> 01:23:36.445 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHIC AREAS SO ABSOLUTELY

01:23:35.511 --> 01:23:38.180 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT.

01:23:36.445 --> 01:23:40.582 region:rollup2
WE WORK FOR THE CALIFORNIA

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:41.850 region:rollup2
PUBLIC UTILITIES XIN TO. ENHANCE

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:43.819 region:rollup2
WHAT'S CALLED A RESOURCE

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:46.088 region:rollup2
ADEQUACY PROGRAM TO SUE

01:23:43.819 --> 01:23:48.357 region:rollup2
EXPLICITLY RECOGNIZE THE NEED

01:23:46.088 --> 01:23:50.025 region:rollup2
FOR FLEXIBLE RESOURCES IF NOT

01:23:48.357 --> 01:23:51.193 region:rollup2
JUST A MATTER OF BASE LOAD

01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:53.262 region:rollup2
RESOURCES.

01:23:51.193 --> 01:23:55.764 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT IN PART MOVES

01:23:53.262 --> 01:23:57.799 region:rollup2
THE INCENTIVE FOR. A FLEXIBLE

01:23:55.764 --> 01:23:59.735 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO EITHER DEVELOP OR

01:23:57.799 --> 01:24:01.503 region:rollup2
BECOME MORE FLEXIBLE AS A RESULT

01:23:59.735 --> 01:24:02.638 region:rollup2
OF THAT I KNOW SOME OF THE EVEN

01:24:01.503 --> 01:24:04.139 region:rollup2
GAS RESOURCES HAVE BEEN.

01:24:02.638 --> 01:24:05.440 region:rollup2
MADE.

01:24:04.139 --> 01:24:06.675 region:rollup2
MODIFICATIONS TO MAKE THEM MORE

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:09.511 region:rollup2
FLEXIBLE

01:24:06.675 --> 01:24:11.613 region:rollup2
WE'VE SHOWN HOW GEOTHERMAL CAN

01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:13.382 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BE A FLEXIBLE RESOURCE

01:24:11.613 --> 01:24:14.683 region:rollup2
AND NOT BE A BASELOAD RESOURCE

01:24:13.382 --> 01:24:15.183 region:rollup2
AND THAT PROVIDES US TO MAKE

01:24:14.683 --> 01:24:16.885 region:rollup2
MORE ROOM ACTUALLY HELP

01:24:15.183 --> 01:24:18.654 region:rollup2
DISPATCH.

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:19.788 region:rollup2
IN THE MIDDLE DAY IT CAN BE DONE

01:24:18.654 --> 01:24:20.722 region:rollup2
IN MAY BE SLIGHTLY MORE

01:24:19.788 --> 01:24:22.024 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE THAT WE HAVE THE

01:24:20.722 --> 01:24:22.958 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO DO WE HAVE THE

01:24:22.024 --> 01:24:24.860 region:rollup2
CAPABILITY.

01:24:22.958 --> 01:24:25.227 region:rollup2
CAN CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:27.029 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE OTHER.

01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:28.597 region:rollup2
.

01:24:27.029 --> 01:24:30.432 region:rollup2
RENEWAL PULLED THAT IS SOMEWHAT

01:24:28.597 --> 01:24:31.767 region:rollup2
CONTROVERSIAL BEING THAT.

01:24:30.432 --> 01:24:34.036 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BY MAIL JUSTICE

01:24:31.767 --> 01:24:35.404 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES FEEL THAT THEY ARE

01:24:34.036 --> 01:24:38.307 region:rollup2
IMPACTED BUT BIOMASS.

01:24:35.404 --> 01:24:40.475 region:rollup2
AND THE ROLE THAT THE IN A

01:24:38.307 --> 01:24:41.410 region:rollup2
DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO. TIES YOU

01:24:40.475 --> 01:24:44.279 region:rollup2
REFER TO A MAY PLAY.

01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:45.681 region:rollup2
.

01:24:44.279 --> 01:24:49.217 region:rollup2
I I THINK THAT I THINK AND A

01:24:45.681 --> 01:24:50.452 region:rollup2
DIVERSE SUPPORT PORTFOLIO AND A.

01:24:49.217 --> 01:24:51.954 region:rollup2
WHO ALSO A IN CONJUNCTION WITH

01:24:50.452 --> 01:24:53.588 region:rollup2
IT A?

01:24:51.954 --> 01:24:55.757 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:57.526 region:rollup2
PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:58.994 region:rollup2
DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE. AND WHAT

01:24:57.526 --> 01:25:00.896 region:rollup2
TYPES OF RESOURCES YOU PLACE IN

01:24:58.994 --> 01:25:02.764 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM AND I THINK THAT AT

01:25:00.896 --> 01:25:04.633 region:rollup2
THAT POINT. SHOULD AND I THINK

01:25:02.764 --> 01:25:05.968 region:rollup2
COULD CONSIDER A DISADVANTAGED

01:25:04.633 --> 01:25:07.970 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

01:25:05.968 --> 01:25:09.371 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATIONS.

01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:10.739 region:rollup2
AND I THING THE OTHER PARTY

01:25:09.371 --> 01:25:12.140 region:rollup2
KWACHA'S AS WE.

01:25:10.739 --> 01:25:13.575 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE EXISTING GAS

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:16.011 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND WHAT THOSE

01:25:13.575 --> 01:25:17.412 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ARE DOING IN TERMS OF.

01:25:16.011 --> 01:25:18.246 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

01:25:17.412 --> 01:25:19.881 region:rollup2
THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO.

01:25:18.246 --> 01:25:21.216 region:rollup2
.

01:25:19.881 --> 01:25:22.684 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY REDUCE THE IMPACTS

01:25:21.216 --> 01:25:23.885 region:rollup2
OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

01:25:22.684 --> 01:25:25.053 region:rollup2
THROUGH REGIONALIZATION WHICH

01:25:23.885 --> 01:25:26.822 region:rollup2
SHOWED UP THROUGH THE SP THREE

01:25:25.053 --> 01:25:30.826 region:rollup2
FIFTY STUDY WORK.

01:25:26.822 --> 01:25:31.893 region:rollup2
OKAY THANK YOU.

01:25:30.826 --> 01:25:33.395 region:rollup2
JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT

01:25:31.893 --> 01:25:35.430 region:rollup2
QUESTION AS WE TALK ABOUT THINGS

01:25:33.395 --> 01:25:36.531 region:rollup2
LIKE BIOMASS AND THINGS ARE MORE

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:38.867 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE AND HAVE SOME OF THE

01:25:36.531 --> 01:25:41.370 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES BUT THEY ALSO HELP

01:25:38.867 --> 01:25:43.372 region:rollup2
ADDRESS SOME OF OUR. AGAIN OTHER

01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:44.473 region:rollup2
LARGE STATE ISSUES IN GOALS

01:25:43.372 --> 01:25:46.408 region:rollup2
WILDFLOWERS IT DEVOLVE ISAAC

01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:47.476 region:rollup2
THEY'RE CLEANING UP OUR OUR OUR

01:25:46.408 --> 01:25:48.443 region:rollup2
FORESTS THAT WE DON'T DO A VERY

01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:49.811 region:rollup2
GOOD JOB WITH WHAT OUR

01:25:48.443 --> 01:25:51.113 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURE ECONOMY THAT

01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:53.315 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO HAVE. CUT TREES AND

01:25:51.113 --> 01:25:54.349 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING HOW DO WE BALANCE

01:25:53.315 --> 01:25:55.584 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS WE'VE GOT.

01:25:54.349 --> 01:25:57.152 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF STOCK WE HAVE

01:25:55.584 --> 01:25:58.553 region:rollup2
A LOT OF FUEL THAT WE NEED TO

01:25:57.152 --> 01:26:01.390 region:rollup2
GET RID OF IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN

01:25:58.553 --> 01:26:02.424 region:rollup2
OUR CLEAN AIR BIG MASSIVE FIRE.

01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:03.759 region:rollup2
CAN BLOW ALL OF OUR OUR OTHER

01:26:02.424 --> 01:26:05.227 region:rollup2
GOALS.

01:26:03.759 --> 01:26:06.261 region:rollup2
A AND IF WE CONTINUE TO JUST

01:26:05.227 --> 01:26:08.397 region:rollup2
LOOK FOR AGAIN THINGS THAT ARE

01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:10.465 region:rollup2
MORE LESS EXPENSIVE FROM OTHER

01:26:08.397 --> 01:26:12.267 region:rollup2
PLACES AND THEN. AGAIN WHAT DOES

01:26:10.465 --> 01:26:14.069 region:rollup2
THAT DO HOW DO WE BALANCE ALL

01:26:12.267 --> 01:26:15.170 region:rollup2
WERE CALIFORNIA GOALS.

01:26:14.069 --> 01:26:16.238 region:rollup2
OR HOW ARE OUR CALVET EAGLES

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:17.672 region:rollup2
BALANCED IN A REGULATION

01:26:16.238 --> 01:26:19.608 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

01:26:17.672 --> 01:26:20.542 region:rollup2
YEAH OF I THINK I THINK YOU'VE

01:26:19.608 --> 01:26:22.444 region:rollup2
HEARD BOTH OF US SAY IT'S A

01:26:20.542 --> 01:26:24.946 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT POINT HERE THAT

01:26:22.444 --> 01:26:26.882 region:rollup2
HAVING A REGIONAL ISO DOESN'T IN

01:26:24.946 --> 01:26:28.617 region:rollup2
ANY WAY IMPINGE UPON STATE

01:26:26.882 --> 01:26:29.985 region:rollup2
POLICY TO DO PROCUREMENT.

01:26:28.617 --> 01:26:31.620 region:rollup2
SO TO THE EXTENT IT'S IN

01:26:29.985 --> 01:26:33.889 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S INTEREST TO BUILD

01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:35.791 region:rollup2
MORE BIOMASS IN ORDER TO CARE

01:26:33.889 --> 01:26:36.425 region:rollup2
FOR DYING FORCE AND SO FORTH.

01:26:35.791 --> 01:26:37.292 region:rollup2
IT'S CERTAINLY WITHIN

01:26:36.425 --> 01:26:38.927 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S AUTHORITY TO DO

01:26:37.292 --> 01:26:40.429 region:rollup2
THAT

01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:41.630 region:rollup2
AND AS MARK DESCRIBE WHAT WE'RE

01:26:40.429 --> 01:26:43.098 region:rollup2
DOING AND WHAT WE'RE SHOWING

01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:44.266 region:rollup2
HERE IN A LOT OF THE SLICE IS

01:26:43.098 --> 01:26:46.001 region:rollup2
JUST THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IN

01:26:44.266 --> 01:26:47.269 region:rollup2
DISPATCHING.

01:26:46.001 --> 01:26:48.336 region:rollup2
SO I THINK I THINK ASSEMBLYMAN

01:26:47.269 --> 01:26:49.771 region:rollup2
GARCIA'S QUESTION AROUND

01:26:48.336 --> 01:26:51.506 region:rollup2
FLEXIBLE RESOURCES IS REALLY THE

01:26:49.771 --> 01:26:53.375 region:rollup2
BEST AND EASIEST WAY TO ANSWER

01:26:51.506 --> 01:26:55.077 region:rollup2
YOUR QUESTION. WE GO BACK TO THE

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:55.444 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL SET OF RESOURCES

01:26:55.077 --> 01:26:56.845 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:26:55.444 --> 01:26:59.548 region:rollup2
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT GOING

01:26:56.845 --> 01:27:01.049 region:rollup2
FORWARD IS ALWAYS REMEMBER WE'RE

01:26:59.548 --> 01:27:02.751 region:rollup2
GONNA NEED MORE FLEXIBILITY.

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:04.419 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN MARKET SHOWN SOME OF

01:27:02.751 --> 01:27:07.355 region:rollup2
THOSE GRAPHS WHERE THOSE BOTTOM

01:27:04.419 --> 01:27:09.057 region:rollup2
AREAS ARE BASICALLY FLAT.

01:27:07.355 --> 01:27:11.426 region:rollup2
LIKE THE CONVENTIONAL GEOTHERMAL

01:27:09.057 --> 01:27:12.894 region:rollup2
FLEET WE HAVE TODAY THAT'S NOT

01:27:11.426 --> 01:27:13.962 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY GOING TO BE HELPFUL

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:15.764 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS NEW

01:27:13.962 --> 01:27:17.599 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES LIKE FLEXIBLE

01:27:15.764 --> 01:27:19.301 region:rollup2
GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES THAT CAN

01:27:17.599 --> 01:27:21.103 region:rollup2
ALLOW YOU TO RAMP UP AND DOWN.

01:27:19.301 --> 01:27:23.205 region:rollup2
AND SO THE BUILDING OUT OF

01:27:21.103 --> 01:27:25.874 region:rollup2
BIOMASS FACILITIES NEEDS TO TRY

01:27:23.205 --> 01:27:27.476 region:rollup2
TO AVOID BEING A CONVENTIONAL

01:27:25.874 --> 01:27:29.277 region:rollup2
SORT OF BASELINE TYPE OF

01:27:27.476 --> 01:27:31.279 region:rollup2
OPERATION AND ALLOW FOR

01:27:29.277 --> 01:27:32.981 region:rollup2
DISABILITY TO MOVE UP AND DOWN

01:27:31.279 --> 01:27:35.217 region:rollup2
IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY. AS WE

01:27:32.981 --> 01:27:36.952 region:rollup2
BUILD THAT CONCEPT INTO THOSE

01:27:35.217 --> 01:27:38.487 region:rollup2
PROCUREMENT POLICIES THEN YOU'VE

01:27:36.952 --> 01:27:42.791 region:rollup2
GOT SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY IS

01:27:38.487 --> 01:27:44.593 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE FOR GREAT OPERATIONS.

01:27:42.791 --> 01:27:45.794 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND I THINK WHAT I'M

01:27:44.593 --> 01:27:46.962 region:rollup2
ALSO INTERPRETING FROM WHAT

01:27:45.794 --> 01:27:48.330 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT YOU WOULD

01:27:46.962 --> 01:27:51.633 region:rollup2
NEED SOME ADDITIONAL DIRECTION

01:27:48.330 --> 01:27:54.269 region:rollup2
ON POLICY WHERE WE CAN MAYBE PUT

01:27:51.633 --> 01:27:55.771 region:rollup2
MORE FOCUS ON. GEOTHERMAL AND

01:27:54.269 --> 01:27:57.172 region:rollup2
HOW WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT

01:27:55.771 --> 01:27:58.707 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED AND YOUR.

01:27:57.172 --> 01:27:59.975 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY THAT POINT WOULD

01:27:58.707 --> 01:28:00.709 region:rollup2
BE TO DISPATCH IT.

01:27:59.975 --> 01:28:02.511 region:rollup2
YEAH AND THAT'S WHERE I WAS

01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:04.613 region:rollup2
SAYING MISTER CHAIRMAN SORT OF

01:28:02.511 --> 01:28:05.580 region:rollup2
MY OPENING REMARKS HIS.*

01:28:04.613 --> 01:28:06.715 region:rollup2

GUIDE THAT SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S

01:28:10.986 --> 01:28:13.088 region:rollup2
THE WORDS THE VALUE PROPOSITION.

01:28:12.387 --> 01:28:14.089 region:rollup2
AS YOU START THINKING ABOUT

01:28:13.088 --> 01:28:16.091 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE A NEXT SET OF

01:28:14.089 --> 01:28:17.359 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TRY MAKE SURE THOSE

01:28:16.091 --> 01:28:19.227 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ARE ALIGNED WITH HOW

01:28:17.359 --> 01:28:20.862 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING

01:28:19.227 --> 01:28:22.297 region:rollup2
TO BE OPERATING AND THE BILL GET

01:28:20.862 --> 01:28:23.832 region:rollup2
THE BEST VALUE OUT OF THAT

AND I WANT TO FRAME MY COMMENTS

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:28.530 region:rollup2
BY SAYING YOU SEE YES IS

01:29:26.595 --> 01:29:29.965 region:rollup2
COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING POLICIES

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:31.499 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE GONNA

01:29:29.965 --> 01:29:32.934 region:rollup2
MEANINGFULLY REDUCE GREENHOUSE

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:34.803 region:rollup2
GAS EMISSIONS AND TOXIC AIR

01:29:32.934 --> 01:29:36.171 region:rollup2
POLLUTION. ASSOCIATE WITH THE

01:29:34.803 --> 01:29:38.039 region:rollup2
POWER SECTOR.

01:29:36.171 --> 01:29:40.075 region:rollup2
AND DOING IT IN A WAY THIS HAS A

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:42.143 region:rollup2
POSITIVE EXAMPLE FOR STATES AND

01:29:40.075 --> 01:29:44.679 region:rollup2
OTHER COUNTRIES TO FOLLOW. SO IN

01:29:42.143 --> 01:29:46.114 region:rollup2
MY MIND THIS MEANS MAKING SURE

01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:48.483 region:rollup2
THAT THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION

01:29:46.114 --> 01:29:50.218 region:rollup2
THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION.

01:29:48.483 --> 01:29:52.420 region:rollup2
HAPPENS IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:54.289 region:rollup2
SACRIFICE GRID RELIABILITY AND

01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:55.590 region:rollup2
THAT KEEPS COSTS LOW.

01:29:54.289 --> 01:29:57.125 region:rollup2
I'M HERE TODAY TALKING ABOUT THE

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:59.794 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF A REGIONAL ENERGY

01:29:57.125 --> 01:30:01.663 region:rollup2
MARKET. DESPITE ITS COMPLEXITY

01:29:59.794 --> 01:30:03.198 region:rollup2
BECAUSE UCS BELIEVES THAT IT IS

01:30:01.663 --> 01:30:05.400 region:rollup2
A VERY MEANINGFUL TOOL FOR

01:30:03.198 --> 01:30:06.935 region:rollup2
INTEGRATING MUCH LARGER

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.903 region:rollup2
QUANTITIES OF RENEWABLES.

01:30:06.935 --> 01:30:10.005 region:rollup2
BEYOND WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY

01:30:07.903 --> 01:30:12.207 region:rollup2
PLANNING FOR AND WHAT WE BELIEVE

01:30:10.005 --> 01:30:13.608 region:rollup2
WERE ULTIMATELY NEED TO PROCURE

01:30:12.207 --> 01:30:15.210 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO MAKE A MEANINGFUL

01:30:13.608 --> 01:30:16.811 region:rollup2
THEN ON CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:30:15.210 --> 01:30:18.046 region:rollup2
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT IF WE

01:30:16.811 --> 01:30:19.914 region:rollup2
WANT TO GO FASTER AND FARTHER ON

01:30:18.046 --> 01:30:21.349 region:rollup2
RENEWABLES WE NEED TO SERIOUSLY

01:30:19.914 --> 01:30:23.385 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THE BENEFITS THAT A

01:30:21.349 --> 01:30:24.919 region:rollup2
REGIONAL MARKET PROVIDES.

01:30:23.385 --> 01:30:26.154 region:rollup2
AS I SO MENTIONED THE MOST

01:30:24.919 --> 01:30:27.389 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO TO

01:30:26.154 --> 01:30:29.090 region:rollup2
INTEGRATE LARGE QUANTITIES OF

01:30:27.389 --> 01:30:30.926 region:rollup2
RENEWABLES IS TO INCREASE

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:32.527 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY OF THE SYSTEM. AND

01:30:30.926 --> 01:30:33.895 region:rollup2
CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:30:32.527 --> 01:30:35.864 region:rollup2
GRID OPERATORS TO SHIFT

01:30:33.895 --> 01:30:37.666 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AROUND TO MEET THE

01:30:35.864 --> 01:30:38.967 region:rollup2
CHANGING NEEDS OF THE GREG.

01:30:37.666 --> 01:30:40.302 region:rollup2
SO THE I SAW MENTION THIS BUT I

01:30:38.967 --> 01:30:41.770 region:rollup2
JUST WANT TO STRESS THAT.

01:30:40.302 --> 01:30:43.505 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT

01:30:41.770 --> 01:30:45.540 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES WERE GONNA NEED TO

01:30:43.505 --> 01:30:46.408 region:rollup2
DEPLOY TO GET TO LARGE

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:48.276 region:rollup2
QUANTITIES OF RENEWABLES ON THE

01:30:46.408 --> 01:30:49.811 region:rollup2
GRADE AND TO GET TO A LOW CARBON

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:52.480 region:rollup2
OR ZERO CARBON ELECTRICITY

01:30:49.811 --> 01:30:53.848 region:rollup2
FUTURE. A WESTERN GRADE IS NOT A

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:55.717 region:rollup2
SILVER BULLET AND SHOULD NOT

01:30:53.848 --> 01:30:57.986 region:rollup2
DETRACT IN ANY WAY FROM THE VERY

01:30:55.717 --> 01:30:59.354 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT EFFORTS OUR STATE IS

01:30:57.986 --> 01:31:01.056 region:rollup2
UNDERTAKING TO DO THINGS LIKE.

01:30:59.354 --> 01:31:02.257 region:rollup2
BUILD MORE ENERGY STORAGE AND

01:31:01.056 --> 01:31:04.592 region:rollup2
LOCAL DISTRIBUTED ENERGY

01:31:02.257 --> 01:31:06.695 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO REDUCE CONGESTION

01:31:04.592 --> 01:31:08.029 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THE GRID MORE RESILIENT.

01:31:06.695 --> 01:31:09.297 region:rollup2
TO REDUCE THE NEED TO RELY ON

01:31:08.029 --> 01:31:10.298 region:rollup2
NATURAL GAS SPEAKER PLANTS

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:12.300 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY ONES AND

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:14.202 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:15.270 region:rollup2
ALSO THINGS LIKE SHIFTING MORE

01:31:14.202 --> 01:31:16.204 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY DEMAND TOWARDS TIME

01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:18.006 region:rollup2
WHEN RENEWABLES ARE MOST

01:31:16.204 --> 01:31:19.541 region:rollup2
ABUNDANT OR TARGET ENERGY

01:31:18.006 --> 01:31:21.209 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY TO THE EVENING HOURS

01:31:19.541 --> 01:31:22.344 region:rollup2
WHICH WILL HELP REDUCE THE NEED

01:31:21.209 --> 01:31:23.778 region:rollup2
TO SUDDENLY RAMP UP ANOTHER

01:31:22.344 --> 01:31:25.413 region:rollup2
RESOURCE WHEN WE LOSE OUR SOLAR.

01:31:23.778 --> 01:31:27.816 region:rollup2
GENERATION.

01:31:25.413 --> 01:31:29.117 region:rollup2
BUT IT WERE TRULY COMMITTED TO

01:31:27.816 --> 01:31:31.653 region:rollup2
RAMPING UP RENEWABLES IN A MAJOR

01:31:29.117 --> 01:31:33.188 region:rollup2
WAY WE NEED TO ALSO EXPAND THE

01:31:31.653 --> 01:31:34.255 region:rollup2
CAPABILITIES OF GRID OPERATORS

01:31:33.188 --> 01:31:35.190 region:rollup2
TO SHARE GENERATION AND

01:31:34.255 --> 01:31:37.359 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION RESOURCES

01:31:35.190 --> 01:31:39.094 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT A WIDER FOOTPRINT.

01:31:37.359 --> 01:31:40.128 region:rollup2
THE BIGGEST BENEFITS IN MY MIND

01:31:39.094 --> 01:31:41.262 region:rollup2
EVER REGIONAL GRADE TO

01:31:40.128 --> 01:31:43.765 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA REPAIRS AND THE

01:31:41.262 --> 01:31:45.266 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT ARE NUMBER ONE A

01:31:43.765 --> 01:31:46.801 region:rollup2
REGIONAL GRADE MAKES IT EASIER

01:31:45.266 --> 01:31:48.570 region:rollup2
TO ACCESS LESS FLEXIBLE

01:31:46.801 --> 01:31:51.339 region:rollup2
GENERATION FROM A LARGER POOL OF

01:31:48.570 --> 01:31:53.441 region:rollup2
RESOURCES. WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:55.010 region:rollup2
BRINGING ON ONLINE MUCH LARGER

01:31:53.441 --> 01:31:57.278 region:rollup2
QUANTITIES OF RENEWABLES.

01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:58.546 region:rollup2
NUMBER TWO IT HELPS US UTILIZED

01:31:57.278 --> 01:32:01.116 region:rollup2
LOW COST RENEWABLES AND OTHER

01:31:58.546 --> 01:32:03.118 region:rollup2
STATES THAT WILL COMPLEMENT OUR

01:32:01.116 --> 01:32:05.954 region:rollup2
AMAZING SOLAR RESOURCE BOTH THE

01:32:03.118 --> 01:32:07.655 region:rollup2
LARGE AND THE SMALL SCALE PVP

01:32:05.954 --> 01:32:09.824 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN AND SHOULD FAILED.

01:32:07.655 --> 01:32:11.659 region:rollup2
NUMBER THREE IT HELPS US ACCESS

01:32:09.824 --> 01:32:12.927 region:rollup2
A LARGER MARKET TO ABSORB THE

01:32:11.659 --> 01:32:14.662 region:rollup2
SOLAR GENERATION THAT'S IN

01:32:12.927 --> 01:32:16.398 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO WHAT CALIFORNIA

01:32:14.662 --> 01:32:18.933 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS CAN CONSUMER WHAT'S

01:32:16.398 --> 01:32:19.768 region:rollup2
COST EFFECTIVE TO STORE.

01:32:18.933 --> 01:32:21.403 region:rollup2
THESE OTHER TOOLS THAT I

01:32:19.768 --> 01:32:22.804 region:rollup2
MENTIONED BEFORE ENERGY STORAGE

01:32:21.403 --> 01:32:24.305 region:rollup2
FLEXIBLE THE MAN THEY'RE

01:32:22.804 --> 01:32:25.607 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT SOURCES OF

01:32:24.305 --> 01:32:26.975 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY AND WILL LIKELY BE

01:32:25.607 --> 01:32:28.309 region:rollup2
EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN A

01:32:26.975 --> 01:32:29.944 region:rollup2
REGIONAL MARKET. FOR

01:32:28.309 --> 01:32:31.046 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHING CERTAIN CLIMATE

01:32:29.944 --> 01:32:33.014 region:rollup2
AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

01:32:31.046 --> 01:32:35.050 region:rollup2
JUSTICE OBJECTIVES LIKE REDUCING

01:32:33.014 --> 01:32:37.185 region:rollup2
THE NEED TO RELY ON SPECIFIC IN

01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:38.520 region:rollup2
STATE NATURAL GAS PLANTS TO

01:32:37.185 --> 01:32:39.687 region:rollup2
PROVIDE LOCAL CAPACITY.

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:41.489 region:rollup2
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY

01:32:39.687 --> 01:32:43.091 region:rollup2
ARE AN EFFECTIVE AND COST

01:32:41.489 --> 01:32:43.525 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE SUBSTITUTE FOR

01:32:43.091 --> 01:32:45.360 region:rollup2
PROVIDING THE SYSTEM

01:32:43.525 --> 01:32:47.228 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY.

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:48.496 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA NEED ON A DAILY

01:32:47.228 --> 01:32:50.765 region:rollup2
BASIS WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN WE

01:32:48.496 --> 01:32:52.333 region:rollup2
LOSE OUR SOLAR. AND THAT'S WHAT

01:32:50.765 --> 01:32:54.002 region:rollup2
A REGIONAL MARKET CAN DO.

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:55.070 region:rollup2
I ALSO WANT TO QUICKLY SPEAK TO

01:32:54.002 --> 01:32:56.337 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT A

01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:58.039 region:rollup2
WESTERN GRADE COULD MEAN

01:32:56.337 --> 01:32:59.641 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA GETS MORE OF ITS

01:32:58.039 --> 01:33:01.676 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY FROM COAL FROM FROM

01:32:59.641 --> 01:33:03.278 region:rollup2
WESTERN COAL PLANTS.

01:33:01.676 --> 01:33:04.846 region:rollup2
AS YOU KNOW WE'VE ALREADY

01:33:03.278 --> 01:33:06.748 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED THAT WE'VE ALREADY

01:33:04.846 --> 01:33:08.216 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED A VERY STRONG POLICY

01:33:06.748 --> 01:33:09.384 region:rollup2
THE EMISSIONS PERFORMANCE

01:33:08.216 --> 01:33:11.252 region:rollup2
STANDARD TO PROHIBIT LOAD

01:33:09.384 --> 01:33:13.188 region:rollup2
SERVING AND HE'S HERE. FROM IT

01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:14.989 region:rollup2
RENEWING LONG TERM CONTRACTS

01:33:13.188 --> 01:33:16.491 region:rollup2
WITH INDIVIDUAL COAL PLANTS

01:33:14.989 --> 01:33:17.725 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S BEEN A HUGE DRIVER

01:33:16.491 --> 01:33:18.693 region:rollup2
AND REDUCING COAL THAT WE

01:33:17.725 --> 01:33:20.462 region:rollup2
CONSUME.

01:33:18.693 --> 01:33:22.464 region:rollup2
BUT

01:33:20.462 --> 01:33:24.232 region:rollup2
COAL GENERATION ALSO MAKES IT TO

01:33:22.464 --> 01:33:25.900 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BY WAVE UNSPECIFIED

01:33:24.232 --> 01:33:27.602 region:rollup2
MARKET PURCHASES FOR BUNDLES OF

01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:29.003 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY WHICH IS DIFFERENT

01:33:27.602 --> 01:33:30.505 region:rollup2
FROM ELECTRICITY PURCHASES FROM

01:33:29.003 --> 01:33:31.072 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL PLANTS I KNOW WE

01:33:30.505 --> 01:33:32.140 region:rollup2
TOUCH ON THAT BRIEFLY IN THE

01:33:31.072 --> 01:33:33.975 region:rollup2
LAST.

01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:36.044 region:rollup2
SET OF COMMENTS.

01:33:33.975 --> 01:33:37.445 region:rollup2
ONE THING WE CAN DO ABOUT THIS

01:33:36.044 --> 01:33:39.914 region:rollup2
WHICH HAS BEEN THE MOST

01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:41.583 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT DRIVER FOR COAL PLANT

01:33:39.914 --> 01:33:43.518 region:rollup2
RETIREMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

01:33:41.583 --> 01:33:46.488 region:rollup2
IS EXPOSED THAT COAL GENERATION

01:33:43.518 --> 01:33:48.156 region:rollup2
TO MORE MARKET COMPETITION FROM

01:33:46.488 --> 01:33:49.757 region:rollup2
CHEAPER RESOURCES LIKE

01:33:48.156 --> 01:33:51.426 region:rollup2
RENEWABLES.

01:33:49.757 --> 01:33:52.927 region:rollup2
HAVING ACCESS TO A WESTERN

01:33:51.426 --> 01:33:54.195 region:rollup2
REGIONAL ENERGY MARKET IS GOING

01:33:52.927 --> 01:33:55.797 region:rollup2
TO MAKE IT MUCH EASIER FOR

01:33:54.195 --> 01:33:57.732 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TO GO FARTHER AND

01:33:55.797 --> 01:33:59.701 region:rollup2
FASTER WITH RENEWABLES. AND THAT

01:33:57.732 --> 01:34:00.235 region:rollup2
IN TURN OVER TIME IS GONNA HELP

01:33:59.701 --> 01:34:02.971 region:rollup2
DRIVE COOL OFF THE WESTERN

01:34:00.235 --> 01:34:04.506 region:rollup2
GRADE.

01:34:02.971 --> 01:34:06.374 region:rollup2
EXPANDING THE FOOTPRINT AYE SO

01:34:04.506 --> 01:34:08.376 region:rollup2
ALSO HAS THE BENEFIT OF ADDED

01:34:06.374 --> 01:34:09.577 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY THE CALL THE CURLY

01:34:08.376 --> 01:34:10.678 region:rollup2
MAKES IT TO CALIFORNIA'S

01:34:09.577 --> 01:34:12.647 region:rollup2
UNSPECIFIED WOULD HAVE TO BE

01:34:10.678 --> 01:34:14.449 region:rollup2
DISCLOSED IF THE PLANTS WERE

01:34:12.647 --> 01:34:16.885 region:rollup2
LOCATED IN A WESTERN AYSO. RIGHT

01:34:14.449 --> 01:34:18.553 region:rollup2
NOW ARE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM

01:34:16.885 --> 01:34:20.622 region:rollup2
ASSIGNS UNSPECIFIED MARKET

01:34:18.553 --> 01:34:22.590 region:rollup2
PURCHASES A CARBON ADDER THAT'S

01:34:20.622 --> 01:34:24.459 region:rollup2
LESS THAN COAL BECAUSE WE CAN'T

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:26.361 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SEE WHICH PLANTS ARE

01:34:24.459 --> 01:34:27.795 region:rollup2
PROVIDING THAT GENERATION. IF WE

01:34:26.361 --> 01:34:30.198 region:rollup2
CAN SEE THE COAL WE CAN

01:34:27.795 --> 01:34:32.834 region:rollup2
ACCURATELY SIGN THE RIGHT CARBON

01:34:30.198 --> 01:34:33.801 region:rollup2
VALUE TO THAT ELECTRICITY.

01:34:32.834 --> 01:34:35.103 region:rollup2
A CLOSE JUST BY SAYING THAT

01:34:33.801 --> 01:34:36.404 region:rollup2
THESE ARE COMPLICATED ISSUES

01:34:35.103 --> 01:34:37.839 region:rollup2
WE'RE DISCUSSING THAT REQUIRE WE

01:34:36.404 --> 01:34:40.642 region:rollup2
HAVE MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:34:37.839 --> 01:34:42.377 region:rollup2
DEBATE. AND ALSO TO CRYSTALLIZE

01:34:40.642 --> 01:34:43.778 region:rollup2
THE BOTTOM LINES FOR CALIFORNIA

01:34:42.377 --> 01:34:46.047 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD ABSOLUTELY NEED TO

01:34:43.778 --> 01:34:47.649 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE INTACT IF WE WERE TO

01:34:46.047 --> 01:34:49.184 region:rollup2
CREATE A WESTERN ISO.

01:34:47.649 --> 01:34:50.251 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT ABA A THIRTEEN

01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:51.619 region:rollup2
IS CREATING A MEANINGFUL

01:34:50.251 --> 01:34:52.954 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY WITH THE RIGHT DUE

01:34:51.619 --> 01:34:54.355 region:rollup2
PROCESS TO HAVE THIS

01:34:52.954 --> 01:34:55.590 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION. AND AT THIS POINT

01:34:54.355 --> 01:34:57.225 region:rollup2
I THINK THE BILL LANGUAGE HAS A

01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:58.626 region:rollup2
VERY SOLID FOUNDATION FOR

01:34:57.225 --> 01:35:00.762 region:rollup2
ARTICULATING HOW WE WOULD

01:34:58.626 --> 01:35:02.463 region:rollup2
PRESERVE OUR VALUES. AND PROTECT

01:35:00.762 --> 01:35:04.365 region:rollup2
OUR ABILITY TO CAN SEE IT TECH

01:35:02.463 --> 01:35:07.869 region:rollup2
CONTINUE PURSUING OUR CLIMATE

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:09.537 region:rollup2

AND.

01:35:13.007 --> 01:35:17.145 region:rollup2
WE REPRESENT DAY.

01:35:14.309 --> 01:35:18.713 region:rollup2
VAST ARRAY OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT.

01:35:17.145 --> 01:35:20.481 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE INVESTED TENS OF

01:35:18.713 --> 01:35:21.649 region:rollup2
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

01:35:20.481 --> 01:35:23.151 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TO MEET OUR CA.

01:35:21.649 --> 01:35:24.319 region:rollup2
AGREEING CLIMATE GOALS AND THESE

01:35:23.151 --> 01:35:27.055 region:rollup2
INCLUDE WIND.

UTILITY SCALE SOLAR GEOTHERMAL

01:35:27.055 --> 01:35:30.425 region:rollup2
BIOMASS AND THE GAS LEAKED OUT

01:35:29.190 --> 01:35:32.293 region:rollup2
THAT HAS BEEN MODERNIZE TO LOWER

01:35:30.425 --> 01:35:33.127 region:rollup2
ITS CARBON.

01:35:32.293 --> 01:35:35.029 region:rollup2
FOOTPRINT.

01:35:33.127 --> 01:35:36.731 region:rollup2
AS WE ARE TO MEET RAMPS AND

01:35:35.029 --> 01:35:38.933 region:rollup2
OTHER NEEDS HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:35:36.731 --> 01:35:41.502 region:rollup2
SO WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY

01:35:38.933 --> 01:35:43.938 region:rollup2
I MISTER CHAIRMAN TO.

AB PRESENT OUR SUPPORT FOR A

01:35:43.938 --> 01:35:47.242 region:rollup2
PROPERLY STRUCTURED.

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:48.910 region:rollup2
REGIONAL MARKET TO HELP ME

01:35:47.242 --> 01:35:50.912 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S GREEN FUTURE THINK

01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:51.813 region:rollup2
THIS CAN BE DONE AND I ALSO WANT

01:35:50.912 --> 01:35:53.047 region:rollup2
TO THANK YOU FOR.

01:35:51.813 --> 01:35:57.585 region:rollup2
AB.

01:35:53.047 --> 01:35:58.152 region:rollup2
A THIRTEEN SO WHILE IT'S A WORK

01:35:57.585 --> 01:35:58.353 region:rollup2
IN PROGRESS THAT SUBJECT AT

01:35:58.152 --> 01:35:59.020 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:35:58.353 --> 01:35:59.554 region:rollup2
PACIFIC HEARING TODAY AYE IT

01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:00.688 region:rollup2
DOES PROVIDE SOME FOCUS.

01:35:59.554 --> 01:36:02.390 region:rollup2
TO TAKE THIS DISCUSSION FROM

01:36:00.688 --> 01:36:03.491 region:rollup2
THE ABSTRACT WHICH WE'VE HAD.

01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:05.226 region:rollup2
A COUPLE YEARS OF.

01:36:03.491 --> 01:36:06.828 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY HAVING THE DEBATE

01:36:05.226 --> 01:36:08.463 region:rollup2
ABOUT WORDS ON PAPER SO I THINK

01:36:06.828 --> 01:36:09.731 region:rollup2
IT'LL HELP FOCUS THINGS AND I

01:36:08.463 --> 01:36:11.266 region:rollup2
LOOK FORWARD TO THAT I THINK THE

01:36:09.731 --> 01:36:12.800 region:rollup2
STAFF BACKGROUND MATERIAL DID A

01:36:11.266 --> 01:36:13.434 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD JOB GIVING DE COMEDIAN

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:16.304 region:rollup2
OVERVIEW.

01:36:13.434 --> 01:36:17.538 region:rollup2
HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS AND WHAT'S

01:36:16.304 --> 01:36:20.074 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THERE AT THE DIET SO

01:36:17.538 --> 01:36:21.476 region:rollup2
DID A GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING?

01:36:20.074 --> 01:36:22.810 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT THE.

01:36:21.476 --> 01:36:24.345 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES THAT THEY FACE ARE.

01:36:22.810 --> 01:36:25.346 region:rollup2
AYE WHAT JUST WANNA START UP

01:36:24.345 --> 01:36:26.981 region:rollup2
QUICKLY BY SAYING.

01:36:25.346 --> 01:36:27.181 region:rollup2
THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS HERE

01:36:26.981 --> 01:36:29.717 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:36:27.181 --> 01:36:30.852 region:rollup2
ARE NOT NEW OKAY SO THE

01:36:29.717 --> 01:36:33.288 region:rollup2
REGIONAL ENERGY MARKETS.

01:36:30.852 --> 01:36:35.023 region:rollup2
BASICALLY ARE NOT NEW AT ALL

01:36:33.288 --> 01:36:36.457 region:rollup2
THEY WENT TO A FACT OVER FIFTY

01:36:35.023 --> 01:36:37.659 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO SO MATTER FACT

01:36:36.457 --> 01:36:39.961 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT KENNEDY IN NINETEEN

01:36:37.659 --> 01:36:41.929 region:rollup2
SIXTY ONE ORDERED AS A PLANNED

01:36:39.961 --> 01:36:43.665 region:rollup2
AND INCORPORATED NORTHWEST WITH

01:36:41.929 --> 01:36:44.832 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIAN THE SOUTHWEST. I

01:36:43.665 --> 01:36:45.400 region:rollup2
KNOW THERE'S MAYBE ONLY TEN

01:36:44.832 --> 01:36:47.235 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN THE ROOM THAT WERE

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:47.835 region:rollup2
AROUND THEN BUT DOT THAT'S WHAT

01:36:47.235 --> 01:36:49.737 region:rollup2
HAPPENED.

01:36:47.835 --> 01:36:51.673 region:rollup2
CONGRESS DID APPROPRIATE MONEY

01:36:49.737 --> 01:36:53.741 region:rollup2
AND WE DID BUILD A TRANSMISSION

01:36:51.673 --> 01:36:56.678 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT.

01:36:53.741 --> 01:36:59.347 region:rollup2
INCLUDE TO AC LEADS IN THE DC

01:36:56.678 --> 01:37:01.482 region:rollup2
LIVE IN THE NORTHWEST AND WE ARE

01:36:59.347 --> 01:37:02.016 region:rollup2
INTERCONNECTED AS WELL TO THE

01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:04.652 region:rollup2
EAST OF US I'D TO ARIZONA

01:37:02.016 --> 01:37:06.421 region:rollup2
NEVADA.

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:08.523 region:rollup2
SO THE STRUCTURE HAS BEEN THERE

01:37:06.421 --> 01:37:09.924 region:rollup2
THE WIRES HAVE BEEN THERE FOR A

01:37:08.523 --> 01:37:11.125 region:rollup2
LONG TIME.

01:37:09.924 --> 01:37:12.427 region:rollup2
AND.

01:37:11.125 --> 01:37:14.028 region:rollup2
THE.

01:37:12.427 --> 01:37:15.863 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THIS IS ALL IN

01:37:14.028 --> 01:37:17.532 region:rollup2
INTERSTATE MARKET IT'S BEEN

01:37:15.863 --> 01:37:19.667 region:rollup2
THERE FOR THAT PERIOD OF TIME IT

01:37:17.532 --> 01:37:21.769 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO THE COMMERCE

01:37:19.667 --> 01:37:24.806 region:rollup2
CLAUSE IN THE FEDERAL POWER ACT

01:37:21.769 --> 01:37:25.807 region:rollup2
AND ALL THE THINGS THAT GO WITH

01:37:24.806 --> 01:37:27.275 region:rollup2
INTERSTATE MARKETS.

01:37:25.807 --> 01:37:27.942 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S A BE I THINK AS YOU

01:37:27.275 --> 01:37:29.210 region:rollup2
HEARD EARLIER ONE OF THEM DIDN'T

01:37:27.942 --> 01:37:30.611 region:rollup2
MAIN DRIVERS FOR THAT AT THE

01:37:29.210 --> 01:37:32.013 region:rollup2
TIME. I WAS AT THE NORTHWEST IS

01:37:30.611 --> 01:37:32.880 region:rollup2
A WINTER PEAKING ENTITY MEETING

01:37:32.013 --> 01:37:33.548 region:rollup2
DATE THEY HEAT THEIR HOMES WITH

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:34.015 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY SO THEY PEAK IN THE

01:37:33.548 --> 01:37:35.516 region:rollup2
WINTER.

01:37:34.015 --> 01:37:36.617 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THE SOUTHWEST IT I

01:37:35.516 --> 01:37:38.086 region:rollup2
HAVE AIR CONDITIONING LOADS WE

01:37:36.617 --> 01:37:39.520 region:rollup2
PEAK IN THE SUMMER.

01:37:38.086 --> 01:37:40.188 region:rollup2
AND SO WAS A WITH A WAY TO

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:41.022 region:rollup2
BASICALLY MOVE THIS POWER BACK

01:37:40.188 --> 01:37:41.789 region:rollup2
AND FORTH WITH A LOT WHICH

01:37:41.022 --> 01:37:42.457 region:rollup2
ALLOWED US BUT NOT OVERBILLED

01:37:41.789 --> 01:37:43.024 region:rollup2
OUR SYSTEMS TO MEET OUR NEEDS WE

01:37:42.457 --> 01:37:44.058 region:rollup2
IMPORT ABOUT TWENTY FIVE TO

01:37:43.024 --> 01:37:45.426 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT OF OUR POWER.

01:37:44.058 --> 01:37:46.260 region:rollup2
WHICH I OBVIOUSLY HAD COST

01:37:45.426 --> 01:37:46.894 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ASSOCIATED

01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:49.097 region:rollup2
WITH IT.

01:37:46.894 --> 01:37:49.731 region:rollup2
THIS PARALLELS DISCUSSION WE

01:37:49.097 --> 01:37:50.231 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN ALL GOING TO LITTLE

01:37:49.731 --> 01:37:52.333 region:rollup2
MORE DETAIL.

01:37:50.231 --> 01:37:53.835 region:rollup2
WITH WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY WITH

01:37:52.333 --> 01:37:54.936 region:rollup2
THAT BASICALLY SOLAR BEING ABLE

01:37:53.835 --> 01:37:55.103 region:rollup2
TO EXPORT IT WHEN WE DON'T NEED

01:37:54.936 --> 01:37:57.338 region:rollup2
IT.

01:37:55.103 --> 01:37:59.440 region:rollup2
OR WERE IN ACCESS AND ALSO TO

01:37:57.338 --> 01:38:00.274 region:rollup2
IMPORT WIND WHEN IT MAY BE

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:03.845 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE IN OTHER REGIONS.

01:38:00.274 --> 01:38:04.212 region:rollup2
IN HELP US BEAT SOBRE PEEKING

01:38:03.845 --> 01:38:05.046 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES.

01:38:04.212 --> 01:38:07.014 region:rollup2
TWENTY YEARS AGO.

01:38:05.046 --> 01:38:08.516 region:rollup2
A MARCH THIRTY FIRST SO THERE'S

01:38:07.014 --> 01:38:09.984 region:rollup2
A BIRTHDAY COMING UP THE AYE AYE

01:38:08.516 --> 01:38:11.185 region:rollup2
SO WENT LIVE.

01:38:09.984 --> 01:38:13.254 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD.

01:38:11.185 --> 01:38:14.689 region:rollup2
EXPLANATION OF WHAT IT IS STATE

01:38:13.254 --> 01:38:16.023 region:rollup2
DO IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE BORING

01:38:14.689 --> 01:38:17.358 region:rollup2
CALLASPO'S TO KEEP SYSTEM AT

01:38:16.023 --> 01:38:19.594 region:rollup2
SIXTY HERTZ TO KEEP US FROM

01:38:17.358 --> 01:38:20.862 region:rollup2
BEING SERBIA BUT APPARENTLY IT'S

01:38:19.594 --> 01:38:23.865 region:rollup2
GOTTEN MUCH MORE INTERESTING

01:38:20.862 --> 01:38:24.532 region:rollup2
OVER LAST OVER YEARS.

01:38:23.865 --> 01:38:25.032 region:rollup2
WE WHAT WE BELIEVE IS IMPORTANT

01:38:24.532 --> 01:38:26.434 region:rollup2
AS THEY ARE AIR TRAFFIC

01:38:25.032 --> 01:38:27.769 region:rollup2
CONTROLLER OF ELECTRONS THEY

01:38:26.434 --> 01:38:29.637 region:rollup2
DON'T OWN THE TRANSMISSION

01:38:27.769 --> 01:38:31.606 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THEY HAVE NO ECONOMIC

01:38:29.637 --> 01:38:32.507 region:rollup2
INTEREST IN THAT. INFORMED US

01:38:31.606 --> 01:38:33.708 region:rollup2
THAT IS INDEPENDENT POWER

01:38:32.507 --> 01:38:34.909 region:rollup2
PRODUCERS THAT ACTUALLY

01:38:33.708 --> 01:38:37.678 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED NGUYEN PLANTS AND

01:38:34.909 --> 01:38:38.112 region:rollup2
SOLAR PLANTS IN JUNE THERMAL

01:38:37.678 --> 01:38:39.480 region:rollup2
PLANTS GAS PLANTS.

01:38:38.112 --> 01:38:41.048 region:rollup2
NOT HAVING THE TRANSMISSION

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:42.483 region:rollup2
SYSTEM GAINED IN USE BY THE

01:38:41.048 --> 01:38:43.451 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION OWNER AWAY THE

01:38:42.483 --> 01:38:45.453 region:rollup2
COULD DETAILS.

01:38:43.451 --> 01:38:46.721 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

01:38:45.453 --> 01:38:49.924 region:rollup2
COMPETITION WAS CRITICAL.

01:38:46.721 --> 01:38:51.058 region:rollup2
SO IT HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON.

01:38:49.924 --> 01:38:53.394 region:rollup2
AND BASICALLY OPENING UP

01:38:51.058 --> 01:38:54.562 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND

01:38:53.394 --> 01:38:55.430 region:rollup2
OUR NOBLE BASE.

01:38:54.562 --> 01:38:58.232 region:rollup2
IN OUR OTHER.

01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:59.400 region:rollup2
OTHER CLEAN RESOURCES I IN IN

01:38:58.232 --> 01:39:01.102 region:rollup2
MEETING OUR NEEDS.

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:03.304 region:rollup2
AS YOU HEARD CALIFORNIA HE AYE

01:39:01.102 --> 01:39:03.838 region:rollup2
SO DOES NOT INITIATE POLICY.

01:39:03.304 --> 01:39:05.940 region:rollup2
IT'S DONE A GOOD JOB OF

01:39:03.838 --> 01:39:07.408 region:rollup2
INTEGRATING WHAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:09.343 region:rollup2
HAS SENT TO IT OVER THE YEARS A

01:39:07.408 --> 01:39:10.378 region:rollup2
TERMS OF POLICIES WE WOULD

01:39:09.343 --> 01:39:12.480 region:rollup2
EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE TO DO

01:39:10.378 --> 01:39:14.415 region:rollup2
THAT. HAZARD AS A METAL

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:15.216 region:rollup2
INDICATES IT IS FOR IT REGULATED

01:39:14.415 --> 01:39:17.518 region:rollup2
AND THE AYE IN.

01:39:15.216 --> 01:39:19.320 region:rollup2
A CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM

01:39:17.518 --> 01:39:21.255 region:rollup2
OPERATOR MEANS SAID IT A IT'S

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:23.191 region:rollup2
NOT A STATE AGENCY AND IT'S NOT

01:39:21.255 --> 01:39:23.724 region:rollup2
COMMERCIALLY OWNED BY ANYBODY SO

01:39:23.191 --> 01:39:24.158 region:rollup2
THAT INDEPENDENCE IS VERY

01:39:23.724 --> 01:39:25.893 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

01:39:24.158 --> 01:39:27.395 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD THE BENEFITS AS

01:39:25.893 --> 01:39:28.930 region:rollup2
WE SEE A IN ITS NOT ONLY ONE

01:39:27.395 --> 01:39:30.665 region:rollup2
SOLUTION AS I THINK AT PEOPLE

01:39:28.930 --> 01:39:32.133 region:rollup2
HAVE INDICATED EARLIER. IT DOES

01:39:30.665 --> 01:39:33.034 region:rollup2
ALLOW US TO.

01:39:32.133 --> 01:39:35.136 region:rollup2
BASICALLY.

01:39:33.034 --> 01:39:36.170 region:rollup2
BETTER MANAGE OUR PORTFOLIO.

01:39:35.136 --> 01:39:38.105 region:rollup2
WHICH ALLOWS US IS.

01:39:36.170 --> 01:39:39.273 region:rollup2
SHOULD MISTER PATTERSON IT

01:39:38.105 --> 01:39:42.076 region:rollup2
INDICATED TO.

01:39:39.273 --> 01:39:43.744 region:rollup2
EXPORT EXES RENEWABLES WHEN IT

01:39:42.076 --> 01:39:46.013 region:rollup2
NECESSARY I'LL ADD I THINK.

01:39:43.744 --> 01:39:47.281 region:rollup2
MISS WHISTLING JUST ALREADY.

01:39:46.013 --> 01:39:49.183 region:rollup2
YEAH HIT UPON THIS.

01:39:47.281 --> 01:39:51.252 region:rollup2
IS IT ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL

01:39:49.183 --> 01:39:53.020 region:rollup2
DISPLACING FALSO RESOURCES.

01:39:51.252 --> 01:39:54.989 region:rollup2
ELSEWHERE IN THE WEST OTHER

01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:56.691 region:rollup2
CHRISTIAN WEST ISN'T GOING TO D.

01:39:54.989 --> 01:39:58.593 region:rollup2
CARBONIZED BECAUSE CALIFORNIA

01:39:56.691 --> 01:40:00.962 region:rollup2
TELLS THEM TO. BUT THEY WILL BUY

01:39:58.593 --> 01:40:02.530 region:rollup2
CHEAP ELECTRONS FROM US AND

01:40:00.962 --> 01:40:04.165 region:rollup2
JUDGE SO I THINK THAT THAT'S A A

01:40:02.530 --> 01:40:06.334 region:rollup2
REAL OPPORTUNITY THERE.

01:40:04.165 --> 01:40:07.768 region:rollup2
IT ALLOWS US TO ACCESS LOWER

01:40:06.334 --> 01:40:09.737 region:rollup2
COST RENEWABLES AS I SAID THERE

01:40:07.768 --> 01:40:11.072 region:rollup2
ARE NGUYEN RESOURCES THAT MAY

01:40:09.737 --> 01:40:12.006 region:rollup2
NOT CURRENTLY BE AVAILABLE TO

01:40:11.072 --> 01:40:13.774 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE LACKEY

01:40:12.006 --> 01:40:15.877 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION. ABOUT MAYBE IN

01:40:13.774 --> 01:40:17.712 region:rollup2
ABOUT A AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE

01:40:15.877 --> 01:40:19.013 region:rollup2
AS MS RIVLIN INDICATED IT WILL

01:40:17.712 --> 01:40:20.381 region:rollup2
IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY FROM THE

01:40:19.013 --> 01:40:21.949 region:rollup2
STANDPOINT OF THE I SO WILL KNOW

01:40:20.381 --> 01:40:23.017 region:rollup2
WHAT'S BEING DISPATCHED. THE

01:40:21.949 --> 01:40:24.085 region:rollup2
WHAT IMPACT.

01:40:23.017 --> 01:40:25.419 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE EXPECTING THAT THE

01:40:24.085 --> 01:40:27.255 region:rollup2
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OF.

01:40:25.419 --> 01:40:29.657 region:rollup2
THIS ENTITY REMAINS.

01:40:27.255 --> 01:40:30.458 region:rollup2
REMAINS INDEPENDENT AS IT IS

01:40:29.657 --> 01:40:32.660 region:rollup2
TODAY.

01:40:30.458 --> 01:40:34.462 region:rollup2
AND THAT THEY'LL BE COMPARABLE

01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:37.365 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO THE.

01:40:34.462 --> 01:40:38.533 region:rollup2
GRID AS AT ALSO AS THERE IS

01:40:37.365 --> 01:40:40.902 region:rollup2
TODAY.

01:40:38.533 --> 01:40:43.638 region:rollup2
SO THE IT THAT THE YOU KNOW

01:40:40.902 --> 01:40:45.840 region:rollup2
THAT WE ALSO BELIEVE COMBAT ALL

01:40:43.638 --> 01:40:49.010 region:rollup2
THESE THINGS COMBINED WILL HELP

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:51.579 region:rollup2
LOWER THE COST OF BEING OUR

01:40:49.010 --> 01:40:55.349 region:rollup2
CARBON GOALS IN THE FUTURE AND I

01:40:51.579 --> 01:40:58.185 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S KEY. A IN TERMS OF

01:40:55.349 --> 01:41:01.489 region:rollup2
TRIED TO MEET THE OF THESE GOALS

01:40:58.185 --> 01:41:05.693 region:rollup2
WHICH WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT

01:41:01.489 --> 01:41:06.427 region:rollup2
BUT IN A MANNER THAT THAT LOWERS

01:41:05.693 --> 01:41:07.395 region:rollup2
THE COST.

01:41:06.427 --> 01:41:09.196 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANT POINT HERE IS.

01:41:07.395 --> 01:41:10.331 region:rollup2
THE ROLE OF THE STATE IN THAT.

01:41:09.196 --> 01:41:11.299 region:rollup2
IN THAT REGIONAL MARKET.

01:41:10.331 --> 01:41:12.400 region:rollup2
AND CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE

01:41:11.299 --> 01:41:14.335 region:rollup2
HAVE CONTROL OVER ITS RESOURCE

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:14.969 region:rollup2
DECISIONS LIKE THE OUR PS.

01:41:14.335 --> 01:41:17.638 region:rollup2
THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY STORE YOU

01:41:14.969 --> 01:41:19.240 region:rollup2
SEE WHEN YOU ENACT

01:41:17.638 --> 01:41:20.875 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THAT.

01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:22.376 region:rollup2
YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO THE

01:41:20.875 --> 01:41:24.145 region:rollup2
COMMERCE CLAUSE AND OTHER THINGS

01:41:22.376 --> 01:41:26.247 region:rollup2
YOU WRITE THEM SMARTLY AND

01:41:24.145 --> 01:41:27.648 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SO FAR HAS DONE AT

01:41:26.247 --> 01:41:29.183 region:rollup2
OUR PS WE SPEND LOT OF TIME.

01:41:27.648 --> 01:41:30.518 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT IT COMPLIES

01:41:29.183 --> 01:41:32.053 region:rollup2
WITH THE COMMERCE CLAUSE IN IN

01:41:30.518 --> 01:41:34.121 region:rollup2
THE PAST SEVEN YEARS NO ONE'S

01:41:32.053 --> 01:41:34.689 region:rollup2
CHALLENGED IT OKAY SO I THINK

01:41:34.121 --> 01:41:36.524 region:rollup2
WE'RE PRETTY WELL ON OUR WAY

01:41:34.689 --> 01:41:38.426 region:rollup2
DOWN THE ROAD. AND WHILE THE

01:41:36.524 --> 01:41:40.027 region:rollup2
WORDS CHIEF JUSTICE MONEY JONES

01:41:38.426 --> 01:41:42.363 region:rollup2
WILL NEVER LEAVE ANYBODY SLIPS

01:41:40.027 --> 01:41:43.597 region:rollup2
I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT IT

01:41:42.363 --> 01:41:46.267 region:rollup2
WOULD WHICH WITHSTAND.

01:41:43.597 --> 01:41:47.668 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL SCRUTINY SO I I

01:41:46.267 --> 01:41:48.369 region:rollup2
THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:41:47.668 --> 01:41:50.071 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S THEIR CALL

01:41:48.369 --> 01:41:51.672 region:rollup2
IT CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO

01:41:50.071 --> 01:41:53.274 region:rollup2
HAVE CONTROL OVER IT CO TWO

01:41:51.672 --> 01:41:55.309 region:rollup2
POLICY AND THAT'S BEEN

01:41:53.274 --> 01:41:57.345 region:rollup2
CHALLENGED INTO A BIT CALIFORNIA

01:41:55.309 --> 01:41:59.046 region:rollup2
ONE ON THAT. I CALIFORNIA.

01:41:57.345 --> 01:42:02.149 region:rollup2
IT HAS CONTROL OVER

01:41:59.046 --> 01:42:04.151 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION CITING AND.

01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:06.454 region:rollup2
RESOURCE.

01:42:04.151 --> 01:42:09.890 region:rollup2
PLANNING IT HAS.

01:42:06.454 --> 01:42:11.058 region:rollup2
IT IT HAS CONTROL OVER CITING

01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:13.995 region:rollup2
OF GENERATION.

01:42:11.058 --> 01:42:16.998 region:rollup2
IT WITHIN ITS BORDERS IT SETS

01:42:13.995 --> 01:42:18.132 region:rollup2
RETAIL RATES ID HAS RETAIL

01:42:16.998 --> 01:42:21.435 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

01:42:18.132 --> 01:42:23.204 region:rollup2
THE AP HAS TAX POLICIES THAT IT

01:42:21.435 --> 01:42:25.172 region:rollup2
THAT IT SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS

01:42:23.204 --> 01:42:28.075 region:rollup2
DID YOU DO TODAY YOU COULD

01:42:25.172 --> 01:42:28.709 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO DO IN THE FUTURE AND

01:42:28.075 --> 01:42:30.378 region:rollup2
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE.

01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:30.978 region:rollup2
THE EXPANDED I ALSO.

01:42:30.378 --> 01:42:31.445 region:rollup2
AND I JUST WANNA MAKE THIS

01:42:30.978 --> 01:42:32.546 region:rollup2
CLEAR TO EVERYBODY.

01:42:31.445 --> 01:42:33.147 region:rollup2
WILL NOT AFFECT CALIFORNIA'S

01:42:32.546 --> 01:42:34.382 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO PURSUE ITS POLICY

01:42:33.147 --> 01:42:35.016 region:rollup2
GOALS IN THE FUTURE

01:42:34.382 --> 01:42:35.650 region:rollup2
I'M YEAH I AND.

01:42:35.016 --> 01:42:37.451 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO

01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:38.719 region:rollup2
HAVE CONTROL OVER ITS POLICIES

01:42:37.451 --> 01:42:39.320 region:rollup2
AS I SAID IT IS AGAIN THE LAWS

01:42:38.719 --> 01:42:40.421 region:rollup2
LONGER CONSISTENT WITH. THE

01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:42.156 region:rollup2
COMMERCE CLAUSE IN THE FEDERAL

01:42:40.421 --> 01:42:42.890 region:rollup2
POWER ACT WHICH IS YOU KNOW

01:42:42.156 --> 01:42:45.026 region:rollup2
WOULD WHICH IS WHAT THE.

01:42:42.890 --> 01:42:46.594 region:rollup2
STATUS IS TODAY AND ALWAYS HAS

01:42:45.026 --> 01:42:47.261 region:rollup2
BEEN AND SO I THINK THAT'S A

01:42:46.594 --> 01:42:48.162 region:rollup2
POSITIVE THING.

01:42:47.261 --> 01:42:49.730 region:rollup2
AND.

01:42:48.162 --> 01:42:51.065 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WILL YOU KNOW

01:42:49.730 --> 01:42:52.900 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD IN

01:42:51.065 --> 01:42:54.535 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO MOVE ITS POLICIES

01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:57.204 region:rollup2
AND IN WAYS THAT I THINK ARE.

01:42:54.535 --> 01:42:57.438 region:rollup2
WILL HOPE IS MEET OUR FUTURE SO.

01:42:57.204 --> 01:42:59.006 region:rollup2
THE WE.

01:42:57.438 --> 01:43:00.007 region:rollup2
.

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:01.442 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW OUR SUPPORT FOR THIS

01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:01.942 region:rollup2
OUT OF ME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS

01:43:01.442 --> 01:43:02.910 region:rollup2
WILL GIVE US.

01:43:01.942 --> 01:43:05.813 region:rollup2
IT YOU KNOW EXPANDED.

01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:07.615 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL.

01:43:05.813 --> 01:43:09.350 region:rollup2
RESOURCES FROM NOT ONLY AROUND

01:43:07.615 --> 01:43:10.451 region:rollup2
THE REGION BUT ALLOW US TO

01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:12.319 region:rollup2
EXPORTS OF THE INDIGENOUS

01:43:10.451 --> 01:43:13.854 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE HERE.

01:43:12.319 --> 01:43:15.489 region:rollup2
IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:43:13.854 --> 01:43:17.124 region:rollup2
WHICH IS NOT JUST SOLAR AND IT'S

01:43:15.489 --> 01:43:18.392 region:rollup2
NOT JUST WIND ITS BIOMASS IT'S

01:43:17.124 --> 01:43:19.827 region:rollup2
YOU'LL THERMAL THAT SOME OF

01:43:18.392 --> 01:43:22.596 region:rollup2
THESE OTHER RESOURCES THAT ARE

01:43:19.827 --> 01:43:22.963 region:rollup2
FOUNDATIONAL TO OUR MARKET. SO

01:43:22.596 --> 01:43:23.097 region:rollup2
JUST IN CLOSING.

01:43:22.963 --> 01:43:24.365 region:rollup2
.

01:43:23.097 --> 01:43:25.733 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNANCE

01:43:24.365 --> 01:43:26.700 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE OBVIOUSLY OF AN

01:43:25.733 --> 01:43:27.868 region:rollup2
EXPANDED ISO IS OF CRITICAL

01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:29.003 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE.

01:43:27.868 --> 01:43:31.105 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT.

01:43:29.003 --> 01:43:32.707 region:rollup2
AB ERA EIGHT THIRTEEN IS

01:43:31.105 --> 01:43:34.141 region:rollup2
PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK TO HAVE A

01:43:32.707 --> 01:43:35.009 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT ARE

01:43:34.141 --> 01:43:36.777 region:rollup2
DILIGENT OF LEGITIMATE

01:43:35.009 --> 01:43:38.646 region:rollup2
GOVERNANCE ISSUES THAT ARE

01:43:36.777 --> 01:43:39.713 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.

01:43:38.646 --> 01:43:41.248 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THERE ARE THE POLICY

01:43:39.713 --> 01:43:43.050 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS THAT COULD BE TAKEN

01:43:41.248 --> 01:43:44.752 region:rollup2
UP IN OTHER LEGISLATION THAT ARE

01:43:43.050 --> 01:43:45.886 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHEN THAT IS

01:43:44.752 --> 01:43:48.823 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE. TO THANK YOU FOR

01:43:45.886 --> 01:43:50.091 region:rollup2
THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU.

01:43:48.823 --> 01:43:50.925 region:rollup2
DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR THAT

01:43:50.091 --> 01:43:54.228 region:rollup2
THAT THE SUMMER YOU CAN WAY OKAY

01:43:50.925 --> 01:43:54.962 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:43:54.228 --> 01:43:55.996 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN

01:43:54.962 --> 01:43:57.231 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE MATT

01:43:55.996 --> 01:43:59.700 region:rollup2
FRIEDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE

01:43:57.231 --> 01:44:01.135 region:rollup2
UTILITY REFORM NETWORK. I'M I'M

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:03.370 region:rollup2
HERE TO SAY THAT TURNED SUPPORTS

01:44:01.135 --> 01:44:04.572 region:rollup2
GREATER REGIONAL COORDINATION.

01:44:03.370 --> 01:44:06.173 region:rollup2
BUT WE DON'T SUPPORT THE

01:44:04.572 --> 01:44:07.742 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL FOR EYES SO REGIONAL

01:44:06.173 --> 01:44:09.043 region:rollup2
EXPANSION.

01:44:07.742 --> 01:44:10.578 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:44:09.043 --> 01:44:11.712 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT CALIFORNIA IS

01:44:10.578 --> 01:44:13.247 region:rollup2
ALREADY PART OF A REGIONAL

01:44:11.712 --> 01:44:14.748 region:rollup2
MARKET.

01:44:13.247 --> 01:44:16.317 region:rollup2
TRADING OF ELECTRICITY HAPPENED

01:44:14.748 --> 01:44:17.351 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE WEST EVERY HOUR

01:44:16.317 --> 01:44:19.487 region:rollup2
OF EVERYDAY THAT INVOLVES

01:44:17.351 --> 01:44:22.456 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:44:19.487 --> 01:44:24.158 region:rollup2
ENGAGE

01:44:22.456 --> 01:44:25.259 region:rollup2
COORDINATION.

01:44:24.158 --> 01:44:26.660 region:rollup2
IT'S WHETHER CALIFORNIA SHOULD

01:44:25.259 --> 01:44:27.828 region:rollup2
GIVE UP MEANING FULL CONTROL

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:29.563 region:rollup2
OVER THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT

01:44:27.828 --> 01:44:30.898 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OPERATOR.

01:44:29.563 --> 01:44:32.266 region:rollup2
AND CONTRAST TO THE WISE

01:44:30.898 --> 01:44:34.335 region:rollup2
COMMENTS A CHIEF JUSTICE MONEY

01:44:32.266 --> 01:44:37.004 region:rollup2
JONES TO MY LEFT.

01:44:34.335 --> 01:44:38.739 region:rollup2
I DON'T SEE. A COMPELLING VALUE

01:44:37.004 --> 01:44:40.775 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION THE CHI SO EXPANSION

01:44:38.739 --> 01:44:42.376 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO SEE SERIOUS POTENTIAL

01:44:40.775 --> 01:44:43.878 region:rollup2
DOWNSIDE RISKS THAT MUST BE

01:44:42.376 --> 01:44:45.980 region:rollup2
UNDERSTOOD BEFORE THE

01:44:43.878 --> 01:44:48.716 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE MAKES A DECISION

01:44:45.980 --> 01:44:50.084 region:rollup2
THAT CANNOT EASILY BE REVERSED.

01:44:48.716 --> 01:44:51.752 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE REVIEW OF THE

01:44:50.084 --> 01:44:52.887 region:rollup2
STUDIES THAT WE'VE DONE.

01:44:51.752 --> 01:44:55.422 region:rollup2
WE'RE CONCERNED THAT REGIONAL

01:44:52.887 --> 01:44:57.024 region:rollup2
EXPANSION COULD LEAD TO HIGHER

01:44:55.422 --> 01:44:58.726 region:rollup2
COSTS FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS A

01:44:57.024 --> 01:45:00.294 region:rollup2
GREATER UTILIZATION OF COAL AND

01:44:58.726 --> 01:45:02.096 region:rollup2
GAS FIRED POWER PLANTS

01:45:00.294 --> 01:45:04.798 region:rollup2
HIGHER IN STATE GREENHOUSE GAS

01:45:02.096 --> 01:45:06.834 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS FEWER IN STATE JOBS.

01:45:04.798 --> 01:45:08.335 region:rollup2
AND AN INCREASED RISK THAT

01:45:06.834 --> 01:45:09.470 region:rollup2
CUTTING EDGE STATE POLICIES THAT

01:45:08.335 --> 01:45:10.037 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALL INVESTED A LOT OF TIME

01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:11.305 region:rollup2
TO DEVELOP.

01:45:10.037 --> 01:45:14.308 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE SUBJECT

01:45:11.305 --> 01:45:15.709 region:rollup2
A FEDERAL PREEMPTION.

01:45:14.308 --> 01:45:17.378 region:rollup2
THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD

01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:19.013 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IN ADDITION ON IS

01:45:17.378 --> 01:45:20.581 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY AT RISK

01:45:19.013 --> 01:45:22.383 region:rollup2
BECAUSE REGIONAL EXPANSION WOULD

01:45:20.581 --> 01:45:24.185 region:rollup2
IRREVOCABLY MAKE SUBSTANTIAL

01:45:22.383 --> 01:45:26.187 region:rollup2
MODIFICATIONS TO KEY ELEMENTS OF

01:45:24.185 --> 01:45:27.087 region:rollup2
THAT PROGRAM. THAT COULD RESULT

01:45:26.187 --> 01:45:28.289 region:rollup2
IN LESS NEW RENEWABLE ENERGY

01:45:27.087 --> 01:45:29.456 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT.

01:45:28.289 --> 01:45:30.791 region:rollup2
AND GREATER RELIANCE ON

01:45:29.456 --> 01:45:31.792 region:rollup2
RENEWABLE ENERGY THAT IS NEVER

01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:34.094 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY USED TO SERVE

01:45:31.792 --> 01:45:35.930 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND THEREBY PRODUCES

01:45:34.094 --> 01:45:37.998 region:rollup2
FEWER IN STATE ENVIRONMENTAL AND

01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:39.567 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS.

01:45:37.998 --> 01:45:40.901 region:rollup2
THIS IS A ONE WAY TICKET THAT

01:45:39.567 --> 01:45:42.136 region:rollup2
CAN'T BE UNWOUND OF CALIFORNIA

01:45:40.901 --> 01:45:43.871 region:rollup2
WANTS OUT LATER.

01:45:42.136 --> 01:45:46.140 region:rollup2
IT WOULD HAVE TO SPEND

01:45:43.871 --> 01:45:47.842 region:rollup2
YEARS AND HUGE SUMS OF MONEY TO

01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:49.176 region:rollup2
RECONSTRUCT AN ENTIRELY SEPARATE

01:45:47.842 --> 01:45:50.978 region:rollup2
AND NEW WHOLESALE MARKET

01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:53.614 region:rollup2
MECHANISM AND THAT'S PROBABLY

01:45:50.978 --> 01:45:55.349 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

01:45:53.614 --> 01:45:56.884 region:rollup2
OUR PRIMARY CONCERN REALLY IS

01:45:55.349 --> 01:45:58.752 region:rollup2
THAT ELIMINATING THE GOVERNOR

01:45:56.884 --> 01:46:00.054 region:rollup2
APPOINTED.

01:45:58.752 --> 01:46:00.654 region:rollup2
STATE SENATE CONFIRMED BOARD

01:46:00.054 --> 01:46:03.224 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A MISTAKE.THE CURRENT

01:46:00.654 --> 01:46:05.426 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE REQUIRES

01:46:03.224 --> 01:46:07.528 region:rollup2
THE I SO TO BE ACCOUNTABLE TO

01:46:05.426 --> 01:46:10.130 region:rollup2
STATE INTERESTS AND TO ELECTED

01:46:07.528 --> 01:46:11.532 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS LIKE ALL OF YOU.

01:46:10.130 --> 01:46:13.300 region:rollup2
THE EXPANSION OF THE AYE SO

01:46:11.532 --> 01:46:15.369 region:rollup2
INVOLVES ELIMINATING ANY

01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:17.037 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC ROLE FOR CALIFORNIA'S

01:46:15.369 --> 01:46:18.873 region:rollup2
ELECTED OFFICIALS OR REGULATORS.

01:46:17.037 --> 01:46:21.175 region:rollup2
IN SELECTING THE GOVERNANCE OR

01:46:18.873 --> 01:46:22.576 region:rollup2
OVERSEEING THE ISO AND UNDER A

01:46:21.175 --> 01:46:24.245 region:rollup2
RESTRUCTURED ENTITY.

01:46:22.576 --> 01:46:25.312 region:rollup2
ALL OF YOU AND REGULATORS ARE

01:46:24.245 --> 01:46:26.480 region:rollup2
STATE AGENCIES WOULD BE

01:46:25.312 --> 01:46:27.982 region:rollup2
RELEGATED TO SIMPLY PROVIDING

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:29.283 region:rollup2
INPUT.

01:46:27.982 --> 01:46:30.784 region:rollup2
ALONG WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT AND

01:46:29.283 --> 01:46:32.720 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS FROM

01:46:30.784 --> 01:46:34.455 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE WEST IN AFFECT YOUR

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:37.424 region:rollup2
VIEWS WOULD BECOME ONLY

01:46:34.455 --> 01:46:38.926 region:rollup2
MARGINALLY RELEVANT. AND THIS

01:46:37.424 --> 01:46:40.227 region:rollup2
BILL THAT YOU WERE ASKED TO PASS

01:46:38.926 --> 01:46:41.595 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO A VOTE WOULD BE

01:46:40.227 --> 01:46:43.163 region:rollup2
LITERALLY THE LAST BILL YOU'LL

01:46:41.595 --> 01:46:44.732 region:rollup2
EVER GET TO VOTE ON THAT HAS A

01:46:43.163 --> 01:46:45.766 region:rollup2
DIRECT IMPACT ON THE I SO

01:46:44.732 --> 01:46:46.400 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WOULD NO LONGER BE

01:46:45.766 --> 01:46:48.802 region:rollup2
SUBJECT.

01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:49.670 region:rollup2
STATE OVERSIGHT.

01:46:48.802 --> 01:46:51.205 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT TO

01:46:49.670 --> 01:46:52.606 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND

01:46:51.205 --> 01:46:54.174 region:rollup2
IT'S A ONE WAY TICKET AND YOU

01:46:52.606 --> 01:46:56.076 region:rollup2
HAVE ONE CHANCE TO DECIDE

01:46:54.174 --> 01:46:57.878 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT SHOULD GO FORWARD.

01:46:56.076 --> 01:46:58.946 region:rollup2
AND UNDER REGIONAL AYE SO IF THE

01:46:57.878 --> 01:47:00.581 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS ANY

01:46:58.946 --> 01:47:01.515 region:rollup2
CONCERNS.

01:47:00.581 --> 01:47:02.750 region:rollup2
WELL THEY CAN SEND A LETTER TO

01:47:01.515 --> 01:47:04.084 region:rollup2
THE ISO.

01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:05.386 region:rollup2
OR YOU CAN FILE COMMENTS WITH

01:47:04.084 --> 01:47:06.687 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY

01:47:05.386 --> 01:47:08.389 region:rollup2
COMMISSION WERE PRESIDENT

01:47:06.687 --> 01:47:10.057 region:rollup2
TRUMP'S APPOINTEES WILL BE MORE

01:47:08.389 --> 01:47:12.660 region:rollup2
THAN HAPPY TO CONSIDER WHETHER

01:47:10.057 --> 01:47:14.528 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S VIEWS ARE VALID.

01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:16.230 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN.

01:47:14.528 --> 01:47:17.631 region:rollup2
WHEN THE FIRST PROPOSAL FOR AYE

01:47:16.230 --> 01:47:18.832 region:rollup2
AS A REGIONALIZATION CIRCULATED

01:47:17.631 --> 01:47:20.167 region:rollup2
THERE WAS AN IDEA OF A WESTERN

01:47:18.832 --> 01:47:21.568 region:rollup2
STATES COMMITTEE WERE CALIFORNIA

01:47:20.167 --> 01:47:22.970 region:rollup2
WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE A VOTE ON

01:47:21.568 --> 01:47:24.672 region:rollup2
KEY POLICIES.

01:47:22.970 --> 01:47:27.408 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED BY THE

01:47:24.672 --> 01:47:29.176 region:rollup2
ISO WELL THAT'S GONE ON IN THAT

01:47:27.408 --> 01:47:30.744 region:rollup2
FORMAT THE LATEST VERSION AND

01:47:29.176 --> 01:47:32.279 region:rollup2
EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTEEN APPEARS TO

01:47:30.744 --> 01:47:33.948 region:rollup2
RELEGATE THAT COMMITTEE TO

01:47:32.279 --> 01:47:35.215 region:rollup2
SIMPLY PROVIDING INPUT.

01:47:33.948 --> 01:47:36.383 region:rollup2
WELL BE ALL PROVIDE INPUT TO

01:47:35.215 --> 01:47:38.285 region:rollup2
DECISION MAKERS AND IT DOESN'T

01:47:36.383 --> 01:47:39.954 region:rollup2
MEAN THAT THEY A THAT IT'S A

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:41.555 region:rollup2
MEANINGFUL FORM OF AND PUT. IT

01:47:39.954 --> 01:47:42.756 region:rollup2
DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY BINDING FORM

01:47:41.555 --> 01:47:44.024 region:rollup2
OF CONTROL.

01:47:42.756 --> 01:47:45.793 region:rollup2
SO WHY ARE WE CONCERNED ABOUT

01:47:44.024 --> 01:47:48.095 region:rollup2
THIS BECAUSE WE THINK THAT

01:47:45.793 --> 01:47:49.296 region:rollup2
EXPANDING THE I SO DOES INCREASE

01:47:48.095 --> 01:47:50.431 region:rollup2
THE RISK OF LITIGATION AND

01:47:49.296 --> 01:47:52.433 region:rollup2
PREEMPTION OF CALIFORNIA STATE

01:47:50.431 --> 01:47:54.435 region:rollup2
POLICIES.

01:47:52.433 --> 01:47:56.937 region:rollup2
COM RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA HAS AN

01:47:54.435 --> 01:47:58.505 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ROLE IN DISSUADING THE

01:47:56.937 --> 01:48:00.407 region:rollup2
I SO AND ITS BOARD FROM

01:47:58.505 --> 01:48:01.976 region:rollup2
APPROVING BAD MARKET MECHANISMS

01:48:00.407 --> 01:48:03.344 region:rollup2
THAT CAN FRUSTRATE CALIFORNIA'S

01:48:01.976 --> 01:48:05.312 region:rollup2
POLICY INITIATIVES.

01:48:03.344 --> 01:48:06.947 region:rollup2
I'M THAT ROLE WAS GONE UNDER A

01:48:05.312 --> 01:48:08.182 region:rollup2
REGIONAL HAS SO.

01:48:06.947 --> 01:48:09.350 region:rollup2
AND THE REGIONAL AYE SO WOULD

01:48:08.182 --> 01:48:10.317 region:rollup2
DEVELOP MECHANISMS THAT RESPOND

01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:11.618 region:rollup2
TO NEEDS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE

01:48:10.317 --> 01:48:13.087 region:rollup2
REGION.

01:48:11.618 --> 01:48:14.288 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE MECHANISMS MAY

01:48:13.087 --> 01:48:14.822 region:rollup2
VERY WELL CONFLICT WITH

01:48:14.288 --> 01:48:17.524 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S POLICIES AND

01:48:14.822 --> 01:48:19.026 region:rollup2
PRACTICES.

01:48:17.524 --> 01:48:20.094 region:rollup2
ORIGINAL ISO WOULD ALSO INCLUDE

01:48:19.026 --> 01:48:21.995 region:rollup2
MANY STAKEHOLDERS OPPOSED TO

01:48:20.094 --> 01:48:23.497 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S POLICIES.

01:48:21.995 --> 01:48:24.798 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY

01:48:23.497 --> 01:48:27.201 region:rollup2
THEM AS PART OF A SINGLE

01:48:24.798 --> 01:48:29.169 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED WHOLESALE MARKET.

01:48:27.201 --> 01:48:30.671 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW. CALIFORNIA CAN'T BE

01:48:29.169 --> 01:48:32.673 region:rollup2
FORCED TO SUBSIDIZE COAL FIRED

01:48:30.671 --> 01:48:34.475 region:rollup2
POWER PLANTS IN UTAH OR WYOMING.

01:48:32.673 --> 01:48:35.676 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:48:34.475 --> 01:48:37.211 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE ALL PART OF THE SAME

01:48:35.676 --> 01:48:38.812 region:rollup2
REGIONAL GRADE.

01:48:37.211 --> 01:48:40.114 region:rollup2
IN THE SAME REGIONAL MARKET THAT

01:48:38.812 --> 01:48:41.048 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PROVIDES A MECHANISM

01:48:40.114 --> 01:48:42.750 region:rollup2
FOR THE FEDERAL ENERGY

01:48:41.048 --> 01:48:44.351 region:rollup2
REGULATORY COMMISSION TO DO WHAT

01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:46.520 region:rollup2
IT'S INDICATED IT'S INTERESTED.

01:48:44.351 --> 01:48:48.288 region:rollup2
WHICH IS TO PROVIDE NEW SUBSIDY

01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:50.057 region:rollup2
MECHANISMS FOR EXISTING COAL

01:48:48.288 --> 01:48:52.025 region:rollup2
FIRED POWER PLANTS.

01:48:50.057 --> 01:48:53.193 region:rollup2
AND FOR ALL USERS OF THE SAME

01:48:52.025 --> 01:48:54.728 region:rollup2
REGIONAL TRANSMISSION OPERATOR

01:48:53.193 --> 01:48:55.996 region:rollup2
TO PAY FOR THAT.

01:48:54.728 --> 01:48:57.731 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU BRING IN A BUDGET COAL

01:48:55.996 --> 01:48:58.932 region:rollup2
PLANTS INTO YOUR. INTO YOUR

01:48:57.731 --> 01:49:00.768 region:rollup2
WHOLESALE MARKET UNDER THE SAME

01:48:58.932 --> 01:49:02.903 region:rollup2
RTO YOU HAVE ACTUALLY PROVIDED A

01:49:00.768 --> 01:49:04.571 region:rollup2
PATHWAY FOR FORCING THOSE KINDS

01:49:02.903 --> 01:49:06.507 region:rollup2
OF OUTCOMES. AND WE ALSO BELIEVE

01:49:04.571 --> 01:49:08.008 region:rollup2
THAT COURTS ARE LIKELY TO

01:49:06.507 --> 01:49:09.376 region:rollup2
PROVIDE GREATER SCRUTINY.

01:49:08.008 --> 01:49:10.310 region:rollup2
STATE POLICIES THAT AFFECT

01:49:09.376 --> 01:49:11.845 region:rollup2
WHOLESALE MARKETS WHEN THE

01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:14.281 region:rollup2
STATE'S ARE PART OF A SINGLE

01:49:11.845 --> 01:49:15.883 region:rollup2
REGIONAL TRANSMISSION OPERATOR.

01:49:14.281 --> 01:49:17.484 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT ONE OF OUR POTENTIAL

01:49:15.883 --> 01:49:19.386 region:rollup2
PARTNERS IN THE REGIONAL GRADE

01:49:17.484 --> 01:49:20.921 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF UTAH. HAS JUST

01:49:19.386 --> 01:49:22.923 region:rollup2
INCLUDED THEIR LEGISLATURE IN

01:49:20.921 --> 01:49:23.957 region:rollup2
THEIR STATE BUDGET ONE POINT SIX

01:49:22.923 --> 01:49:25.225 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS TO SUE THE STATE

01:49:23.957 --> 01:49:26.927 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA OVER ITS

01:49:25.225 --> 01:49:27.928 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS POLICIES.

01:49:26.927 --> 01:49:28.662 region:rollup2
THEY'RE READY TO GO TO SEE

01:49:27.928 --> 01:49:30.531 region:rollup2
WHAT'S UNDER THE CURRENT

01:49:28.662 --> 01:49:32.566 region:rollup2
PARADIGM AND MY VIEW IS THAT

01:49:30.531 --> 01:49:33.467 region:rollup2
EXPANDING THE I SO ACTUALLY

01:49:32.566 --> 01:49:34.735 region:rollup2
GIVES THEM A GREATER CHANCE OF

01:49:33.467 --> 01:49:36.370 region:rollup2
SUCCESS.

01:49:34.735 --> 01:49:37.538 region:rollup2
TO APPLY OUR POLICIES AS PART OF

01:49:36.370 --> 01:49:39.273 region:rollup2
THE FORK REGULATED SINGLE

01:49:37.538 --> 01:49:40.607 region:rollup2
WHOLESALE MARKET.

01:49:39.273 --> 01:49:41.742 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO WAY TO EXCLUDE OTHER

01:49:40.607 --> 01:49:43.610 region:rollup2
WREAKED OTHER WESTERN STATES

01:49:41.742 --> 01:49:45.479 region:rollup2
FROM PARTICIPATING ONCE THE DOOR

01:49:43.610 --> 01:49:47.281 region:rollup2
IS OPEN YOU CAN'T SIMPLY ALLOW

01:49:45.479 --> 01:49:48.515 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S YOU LIKE TO JOIN.

01:49:47.281 --> 01:49:49.917 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY GETS TO JOIN ON EQUAL

01:49:48.515 --> 01:49:51.652 region:rollup2
TERMS

01:49:49.917 --> 01:49:52.719 region:rollup2
SO IN OUR VIEW THERE IS A HUGE

01:49:51.652 --> 01:49:55.088 region:rollup2
RISK HERE THAT EXPANSION

01:49:52.719 --> 01:49:55.656 region:rollup2
PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR

01:49:55.088 --> 01:49:56.523 region:rollup2
OTHER HOSTILE PARTIES IN THE

01:49:55.656 --> 01:49:57.925 region:rollup2
WEST

01:49:56.523 --> 01:49:59.526 region:rollup2
TO COME AFTER CALIFORNIA'S

01:49:57.925 --> 01:50:01.095 region:rollup2
POLICIES AND IT INVITES

01:49:59.526 --> 01:50:01.628 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SCRUTINY BY THE

01:50:01.095 --> 01:50:02.830 region:rollup2
FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY

01:50:01.628 --> 01:50:05.466 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

01:50:02.830 --> 01:50:07.301 region:rollup2
LAST FRIDAY THE ENTER THE BURKE

01:50:05.466 --> 01:50:08.602 region:rollup2
ISSUED A DECISION RELATED TO.

01:50:07.301 --> 01:50:09.736 region:rollup2
ISO NEW ENGLAND.

01:50:08.602 --> 01:50:11.705 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S FILLED WITH WARNING

01:50:09.736 --> 01:50:12.306 region:rollup2
SIGNS THAT THIS BURKE IS NOT

01:50:11.705 --> 01:50:14.341 region:rollup2
LIKE THE FORK THE CAME BEFORE

01:50:12.306 --> 01:50:16.276 region:rollup2
IT.

01:50:14.341 --> 01:50:18.045 region:rollup2
AND THAT THERE MAYBE NEW LIMITS

01:50:16.276 --> 01:50:20.013 region:rollup2
OR ATTEMPTS TO CREATE LIMITS ON

01:50:18.045 --> 01:50:20.614 region:rollup2
NEW STATE CLEAN ENERGY POLICIES

01:50:20.013 --> 01:50:21.348 region:rollup2
THAT FRUSTRATE REGIONAL MARKET

01:50:20.614 --> 01:50:23.150 region:rollup2
DESIGN.

01:50:21.348 --> 01:50:25.319 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE RISK

01:50:23.150 --> 01:50:27.488 region:rollup2
WHY DON'T WE SLOW DOWN AND TRY

01:50:25.319 --> 01:50:29.590 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES TO EXPANDING THE I

01:50:27.488 --> 01:50:31.124 region:rollup2
SO WHILE WE FURTHER UNDERSTAND

01:50:29.590 --> 01:50:32.860 region:rollup2
WHAT THE RISKS MIGHT LOOK LIKE

01:50:31.124 --> 01:50:34.862 region:rollup2
AS LITIGATION PROCEEDS AND OTHER

01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:36.230 region:rollup2
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

01:50:34.862 --> 01:50:38.098 region:rollup2
OUR CONCERN ABOUT AB EIGHT

01:50:36.230 --> 01:50:39.466 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED IS

01:50:38.098 --> 01:50:41.001 region:rollup2
IT REALLY CONTAINS VERY FEW

01:50:39.466 --> 01:50:42.836 region:rollup2
ENFORCEABLE MEANINGFUL AND

01:50:41.001 --> 01:50:44.505 region:rollup2
DURABLE PROTECTIONS.

01:50:42.836 --> 01:50:46.106 region:rollup2
ON THE OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE

01:50:44.505 --> 01:50:46.573 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED FOR INCLUSION IN THE

01:50:46.106 --> 01:50:47.908 region:rollup2
AYE ESOS NEW GOVERNING

01:50:46.573 --> 01:50:49.343 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTS.

01:50:47.908 --> 01:50:51.245 region:rollup2
ARE VAGUE SUBJECT A SUBSTANTIAL

01:50:49.343 --> 01:50:52.146 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION AND PRETTY MUCH

01:50:51.245 --> 01:50:53.647 region:rollup2
INADEQUATE TO ADDRESS THE

01:50:52.146 --> 01:50:54.114 region:rollup2
LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:50:53.647 --> 01:50:55.682 region:rollup2
THREAT TO CALIFORNIA'S

01:50:54.114 --> 01:50:57.684 region:rollup2
INTERESTS.

01:50:55.682 --> 01:50:58.385 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT THE PROVISIONS IN

01:50:57.684 --> 01:50:59.887 region:rollup2
THE BILL ARE SUBSTANTIALLY

01:50:58.385 --> 01:51:01.688 region:rollup2
WEAKER THAN THOSE THAT WERE

01:50:59.887 --> 01:51:02.289 region:rollup2
INCLUDED IN DRAFTS THAT WERE

01:51:01.688 --> 01:51:04.658 region:rollup2
CIRCULATED BY THE GOVERNOR'S

01:51:02.289 --> 01:51:05.959 region:rollup2
OFFICE JUST SEVERAL YEARS AGO SO

01:51:04.658 --> 01:51:06.560 region:rollup2
IT APPEARS THAT IT'S GOING IN

01:51:05.959 --> 01:51:08.262 region:rollup2
THE WRONG DIRECTION FROM OUR

01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:09.830 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE.

01:51:08.262 --> 01:51:11.031 region:rollup2
AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT

01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:12.699 region:rollup2
THAT ANY GUARANTEES THAT

01:51:11.031 --> 01:51:14.334 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA MIGHT RECEIVE AS PART

01:51:12.699 --> 01:51:16.069 region:rollup2
OF AN INITIAL DEAL. CAN LATER BE

01:51:14.334 --> 01:51:17.070 region:rollup2
REVOKED AND THIS HAS HAPPENED IN

01:51:16.069 --> 01:51:18.005 region:rollup2
OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WERE

01:51:17.070 --> 01:51:19.740 region:rollup2
STATES HAVE ENTERED INTO

01:51:18.005 --> 01:51:22.609 region:rollup2
AGREEMENTS AS PART OF OUR T. O.

01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:24.144 region:rollup2
MARKET MECHANISMS. AND LATER ON

01:51:22.609 --> 01:51:25.345 region:rollup2
THOSE DEALS HAVE BEEN UNWOUND

01:51:24.144 --> 01:51:26.580 region:rollup2
AFTER THE STATE HAD ALREADY

01:51:25.345 --> 01:51:28.348 region:rollup2
PROVIDED IT'S BINDING AGREEMENT

01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:30.083 region:rollup2
IN FACT THAT'S THE BASIS FOR THE

01:51:28.348 --> 01:51:31.451 region:rollup2
HUGE RETAILING CASE THAT THE

01:51:30.083 --> 01:51:31.985 region:rollup2
SUPREME COURT DECIDED TWO YEARS

01:51:31.451 --> 01:51:34.888 region:rollup2
AGO.

01:51:31.985 --> 01:51:36.256 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:51:34.888 --> 01:51:38.492 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE BENEFITS OF

01:51:36.256 --> 01:51:39.693 region:rollup2
REGIONAL EXPANSION ON THE

01:51:38.492 --> 01:51:41.028 region:rollup2
RESULTS ARE QUITE NEXT IN THE

01:51:39.693 --> 01:51:42.496 region:rollup2
EYES OF STUDIES THAT BE THREE

01:51:41.028 --> 01:51:44.231 region:rollup2
FIFTY STUDIES THAT WERE

01:51:42.496 --> 01:51:45.699 region:rollup2
COMPLETED TWO YEARS AGO. AND THE

01:51:44.231 --> 01:51:47.067 region:rollup2
RESULTS ACTUALLY CAN SHOW SLIGHT

01:51:45.699 --> 01:51:48.902 region:rollup2
INCREASES IN YOUR TERM

01:51:47.067 --> 01:51:50.170 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

01:51:48.902 --> 01:51:51.605 region:rollup2
AND HIGHER GREENHOUSE GAS

01:51:50.170 --> 01:51:53.740 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS AND GAS POWER PLANT

01:51:51.605 --> 01:51:55.609 region:rollup2
DISPATCH WITH IN CALIFORNIA.

01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:57.077 region:rollup2
THIS KIND CUTS AGAINST THE IDEA

01:51:55.609 --> 01:51:58.579 region:rollup2
HERE THAT REGIONALIZATION

01:51:57.077 --> 01:51:59.880 region:rollup2
REDUCES THE POLLUTION IMPACT ON

01:51:58.579 --> 01:52:01.481 region:rollup2
LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED

01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:03.183 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. ARMED

01:52:01.481 --> 01:52:04.618 region:rollup2
THE MODELING ACTUALLY SHOWS THAT

01:52:03.183 --> 01:52:05.786 region:rollup2
THERE CAN BE AN INCREASE IN

01:52:04.618 --> 01:52:08.589 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AN

01:52:05.786 --> 01:52:09.289 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN GAS DISPATCH WITH IN

01:52:08.589 --> 01:52:10.390 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:52:09.289 --> 01:52:12.159 region:rollup2
AND.

01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:14.227 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

01:52:12.159 --> 01:52:15.796 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WE HAVE ALSO. NOT THE

01:52:14.227 --> 01:52:17.531 region:rollup2
CURTAILMENT SITUATION I THINK WE

01:52:15.796 --> 01:52:18.865 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE CHALLENGE OF THE

01:52:17.531 --> 01:52:20.167 region:rollup2
SITUATION THAT'S IN FRONT OF US

01:52:18.865 --> 01:52:22.102 region:rollup2
TODAY. I'M WITH.

01:52:20.167 --> 01:52:23.370 region:rollup2
EXCEEDINGLY LARGE AMOUNTS OF

01:52:22.102 --> 01:52:24.838 region:rollup2
INTERMITTENT RENEWABLE POWER

01:52:23.370 --> 01:52:27.274 region:rollup2
CREATING OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES.

01:52:24.838 --> 01:52:29.243 region:rollup2
BUT THE EYES SO ON TODAY JUST

01:52:27.274 --> 01:52:30.477 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED EIGHT DIFFERENT TOOLS

01:52:29.243 --> 01:52:32.112 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE TO TRY

01:52:30.477 --> 01:52:33.080 region:rollup2
TO MANAGE SOME OF THOSE RISKS

01:52:32.112 --> 01:52:34.214 region:rollup2
ONLY ONE OF THEM INVOLVE

01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:35.983 region:rollup2
REGIONAL EXPANSION.

01:52:34.214 --> 01:52:37.985 region:rollup2
AND THEIR OWN STUDY.

01:52:35.983 --> 01:52:39.453 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY FOUND THAT MOST OF THE

01:52:37.985 --> 01:52:41.054 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS IN CURTAILMENT IN

01:52:39.453 --> 01:52:42.990 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTY.

01:52:41.054 --> 01:52:44.524 region:rollup2
CAN BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT.

01:52:42.990 --> 01:52:45.959 region:rollup2
ROBERT WITHOUT REQUIRING THE ISO

01:52:44.524 --> 01:52:47.861 region:rollup2
TO BECOME A REGIONAL GRID

01:52:45.959 --> 01:52:48.929 region:rollup2
OPERATOR SPECIFICALLY THEIR

01:52:47.861 --> 01:52:50.163 region:rollup2
STUDY FOUND THAT SEVENTY FIVE

01:52:48.929 --> 01:52:51.465 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE REDUCTIONS IN

01:52:50.163 --> 01:52:52.733 region:rollup2
CURTAILMENT.

01:52:51.465 --> 01:52:54.901 region:rollup2
COULD BE REALIZED SIMPLY THROUGH

01:52:52.733 --> 01:52:56.570 region:rollup2
ENHANCED BILATERAL COORDINATION

01:52:54.901 --> 01:52:58.905 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE WEST WITHOUT

01:52:56.570 --> 01:52:59.940 region:rollup2
NEEDING TO EXPAND THE ISO.

01:52:58.905 --> 01:53:01.375 region:rollup2
WE THINK SO SO WHAT CAN THE

01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:02.843 region:rollup2
STATE DO.

01:53:01.375 --> 01:53:04.111 region:rollup2
I'M TO CAPTURE SOME OF THESE

01:53:02.843 --> 01:53:04.711 region:rollup2
BENEFITS

01:53:04.111 --> 01:53:06.546 region:rollup2
WITHOUT STEPPING INTO A RISKY

01:53:04.711 --> 01:53:08.081 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT.

01:53:06.546 --> 01:53:09.716 region:rollup2
IN OUR VIEW THE ALTERNATIVES

01:53:08.081 --> 01:53:11.685 region:rollup2
INCLUDE WORKING WITH OTHER IN

01:53:09.716 --> 01:53:12.586 region:rollup2
STATE BALANCING AUTHORITIES.

01:53:11.685 --> 01:53:13.954 region:rollup2
OWNED BY PUBLICLY OWNED

01:53:12.586 --> 01:53:15.389 region:rollup2
UTILITIES TO IN TO INCREASE

01:53:13.954 --> 01:53:17.057 region:rollup2
COORDINATION.

01:53:15.389 --> 01:53:19.526 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE EVEN NEGOTIATE TERMS

01:53:17.057 --> 01:53:20.127 region:rollup2
FOR JOINING THE ISO.

01:53:19.526 --> 01:53:21.628 region:rollup2
NO GOVERNANCE CHANGES WOULD BE

01:53:20.127 --> 01:53:22.996 region:rollup2
NEEDED.

01:53:21.628 --> 01:53:25.065 region:rollup2
TO EXPAND THE ISO WITHIN THE

01:53:22.996 --> 01:53:25.966 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:53:25.065 --> 01:53:27.401 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE'S EXPANDING THE

01:53:25.966 --> 01:53:28.402 region:rollup2
VOLUNTARY ENERGY IMBALANCE

01:53:27.401 --> 01:53:29.636 region:rollup2
MARKET WHICH WAS DISCUSSED A FEW

01:53:28.402 --> 01:53:31.305 region:rollup2
MINUTES AGO.

01:53:29.636 --> 01:53:32.939 region:rollup2
TO PERMIT A GREATER RELIANCE ON

01:53:31.305 --> 01:53:34.408 region:rollup2
TRANSACTIONS WITH OTHER WESTERN

01:53:32.939 --> 01:53:36.243 region:rollup2
BALANCING AUTHORITIES THAT GO

01:53:34.408 --> 01:53:37.744 region:rollup2
BEYOND THE REAL TIME MARKET.

01:53:36.243 --> 01:53:38.445 region:rollup2
ON THE I SO IS CERTAINLY LOOKING

01:53:37.744 --> 01:53:40.647 region:rollup2
INTO THIS AND WE THINK IT'S

01:53:38.445 --> 01:53:41.782 region:rollup2
FERTILE GROUND.

01:53:40.647 --> 01:53:43.417 region:rollup2
HOW COORDINATION WITH THE

01:53:41.782 --> 01:53:44.651 region:rollup2
BONNEVILLE POWER AUTHORITY?

01:53:43.417 --> 01:53:45.819 region:rollup2
BONNEVILLE POWER AUTHORITY

01:53:44.651 --> 01:53:47.220 region:rollup2
CONTROLS A LARGE SET OF HYDRO

01:53:45.819 --> 01:53:48.522 region:rollup2
ASSETS

01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:49.956 region:rollup2
TRYING TO USE THOSE ASSETS MORE

01:53:48.522 --> 01:53:51.558 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY.

01:53:49.956 --> 01:53:53.260 region:rollup2
TO COORDINATE WITH CALIFORNIA'S

01:53:51.558 --> 01:53:54.795 region:rollup2
NEEDS COULD BE A WIN WIN. AND

01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:55.929 region:rollup2
THEN FINALLY WORKING WITH OTHER

01:53:54.795 --> 01:53:58.131 region:rollup2
WESTERN BALANCING AUTHORITIES TO

01:53:55.929 --> 01:53:58.965 region:rollup2
REDUCE BARRIERS TO EXPORTING

01:53:58.131 --> 01:53:59.766 region:rollup2
ACCESS POWER THAT'S PRODUCED IN

01:53:58.965 --> 01:54:01.768 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:53:59.766 --> 01:54:03.070 region:rollup2
SO.

01:54:01.768 --> 01:54:04.805 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM

01:54:03.070 --> 01:54:06.239 region:rollup2
ON THIS WE CERTAINLY LOOK FOR TO

01:54:04.805 --> 01:54:08.208 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH OTHER PARTIES AND

01:54:06.239 --> 01:54:09.109 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIVELY ENGAGING BUT WE

01:54:08.208 --> 01:54:10.510 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU

01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:12.112 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ARE

01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:14.181 region:rollup2
AWARE THAT THIS IS NOT A RISK

01:54:12.112 --> 01:54:15.949 region:rollup2
FREE PROPOSITION. AND WE'RE NOT

01:54:14.181 --> 01:54:18.685 region:rollup2
SURE WHAT BINDING PROTECTIONS

01:54:15.949 --> 01:54:19.453 region:rollup2
CAN BE INCLUDED IN STATE LAW

01:54:18.685 --> 01:54:21.388 region:rollup2
THAT ARE GOING TO GIVE US THE

01:54:19.453 --> 01:54:23.090 region:rollup2
COMFORT. THAT OUR POLICIES ARE

01:54:21.388 --> 01:54:23.690 region:rollup2
NOT GONNA BE IN THE CROSS HAIRS

01:54:23.090 --> 01:54:24.691 region:rollup2
UNDER AN EXPANDED GREAT THANK

01:54:23.690 --> 01:54:26.259 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:54:24.691 --> 01:54:30.630 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:54:26.259 --> 01:54:31.531 region:rollup2
ARMSTRONG.

01:54:30.630 --> 01:54:34.368 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN.

01:54:31.531 --> 01:54:36.536 region:rollup2
BEFORE I GO INTO WORD SOME OF

01:54:34.368 --> 01:54:38.438 region:rollup2
THE PREPARE MARKS THAT I IT DID.

01:54:36.536 --> 01:54:40.006 region:rollup2
A THOUGHT ABOUT AND DISCUSSING

01:54:38.438 --> 01:54:41.608 region:rollup2
TODAY I WANTED TO ESSENCE I HAVE

01:54:40.006 --> 01:54:43.877 region:rollup2
MISTER ROUGHLY OR SLIDE STILL IN

01:54:41.608 --> 01:54:45.145 region:rollup2
FRONT OF ME ANYWAY. A AND THAT'S

01:54:43.877 --> 01:54:46.980 region:rollup2
THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN HIM.

01:54:45.145 --> 01:54:47.948 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT SAYS SOME OF THE

01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:48.782 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT THE THEY CLEARLY

01:54:47.948 --> 01:54:50.784 region:rollup2
ARTICULATE AND AND ONE OF THEM

01:54:48.782 --> 01:54:52.552 region:rollup2
IS.

01:54:50.784 --> 01:54:53.820 region:rollup2
THE YOU SEE THERE SAID AS YOU

01:54:52.552 --> 01:54:55.188 region:rollup2
CAN SEE THE ROLE OF THE GHASTLY

01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:57.324 region:rollup2
IN TODAY'S OPERATION

01:54:55.188 --> 01:54:59.059 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY VERY SICK.

01:54:57.324 --> 01:55:01.728 region:rollup2
IT'S SIGNIFICANT ON THE PEAK DAY

01:54:59.059 --> 01:55:03.964 region:rollup2
SLIDE THAT MISTER ROCK LEADER A.

01:55:01.728 --> 01:55:05.365 region:rollup2
A SET FORTH AND IT'S SIGNIFICANT

01:55:03.964 --> 01:55:07.300 region:rollup2
AND RAMPING SLIDES.

01:55:05.365 --> 01:55:08.769 region:rollup2
THAT HE SET FORTH TO MEET THE

01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:10.871 region:rollup2
RELIABLE OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM

01:55:08.769 --> 01:55:11.338 region:rollup2
SO. JUST SOMETHING THAT WE NEED

01:55:10.871 --> 01:55:13.106 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT.

01:55:11.338 --> 01:55:14.174 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW IT'S A SUBJECTIVE

01:55:13.106 --> 01:55:15.675 region:rollup2
OTHER DISCUSSIONS OTHER

01:55:14.174 --> 01:55:17.844 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION.

01:55:15.675 --> 01:55:19.513 region:rollup2
IT'S BIG IT'S BIG DEAL IT'S

01:55:17.844 --> 01:55:21.114 region:rollup2
WHAT WE RELY ON TODAY IN MANY

01:55:19.513 --> 01:55:22.749 region:rollup2
MANY INSTANCES OF RIVAL SYSTEM

01:55:21.114 --> 01:55:24.985 region:rollup2
OPERATION.

01:55:22.749 --> 01:55:26.119 region:rollup2
AND THE OTHER THING IS AND IT

01:55:24.985 --> 01:55:28.488 region:rollup2
STRIKES ME IS THAT TO HIS JOBS

01:55:26.119 --> 01:55:29.956 region:rollup2
VERY HARD.

01:55:28.488 --> 01:55:31.558 region:rollup2
AND WE SHOULDN'T TAKE IT FOR

01:55:29.956 --> 01:55:33.326 region:rollup2
GRANTED.

01:55:31.558 --> 01:55:34.928 region:rollup2
AND THAT IT'S GETTING MORE

01:55:33.326 --> 01:55:36.763 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING.

01:55:34.928 --> 01:55:38.131 region:rollup2
HE'S CONFIDENT AND I THINK WE

01:55:36.763 --> 01:55:39.332 region:rollup2
ALL ARE SINCE WE'VE MET THE

01:55:38.131 --> 01:55:41.067 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES ALREADY THAT WE WILL

01:55:39.332 --> 01:55:42.669 region:rollup2
NEED IN THE FUTURE. BUT WE

01:55:41.067 --> 01:55:44.137 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T MAKE POLICY DECISIONS

01:55:42.669 --> 01:55:45.405 region:rollup2
THAT MAKETHE JOB MORE DIFFICULT

01:55:44.137 --> 01:55:46.006 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP THAT

01:55:45.405 --> 01:55:47.841 region:rollup2
IN MIND AS WE MOVE FORWARD AS

01:55:46.006 --> 01:55:50.243 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:55:47.841 --> 01:55:51.978 region:rollup2
SO S. SEE ANYWAY ISN'T A DIVERSE

01:55:50.243 --> 01:55:53.380 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION A PUBLIC POWER

01:55:51.978 --> 01:55:55.115 region:rollup2
ENTITIES DATA.

01:55:53.380 --> 01:55:56.783 region:rollup2
ON ELECTRIC SIDE IT'S ABOUT

01:55:55.115 --> 01:55:58.251 region:rollup2
FORTY FORTY THREE FORTY FOUR

01:55:56.783 --> 01:55:59.853 region:rollup2
SOMEONE THAT RANGE OF ELECTRIC

01:55:58.251 --> 01:56:01.321 region:rollup2
UTILITIES.

01:55:59.853 --> 01:56:02.956 region:rollup2
I AND THERE'S MANY POSITIONS

01:56:01.321 --> 01:56:04.357 region:rollup2
WITHIN THAT LARGE GROUP ON

01:56:02.956 --> 01:56:05.859 region:rollup2
REGIONALIZATION SOME ARE

01:56:04.357 --> 01:56:07.627 region:rollup2
STRONGLY OPPOSED.

01:56:05.859 --> 01:56:09.062 region:rollup2
SOME ARE GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE.

01:56:07.627 --> 01:56:10.497 region:rollup2
AND YOU MAY LIKELY HEAR SOME OF

01:56:09.062 --> 01:56:12.466 region:rollup2
THOSE COMMENTS TODAY.

01:56:10.497 --> 01:56:13.233 region:rollup2
AS A WHOLE.

01:56:12.466 --> 01:56:15.769 region:rollup2
I THINK WE ARE.

01:56:13.233 --> 01:56:18.939 region:rollup2
.

01:56:15.769 --> 01:56:21.541 region:rollup2
LOOKING NOT TOWARDS THE IDEA OR

01:56:18.939 --> 01:56:23.276 region:rollup2
CONCEPT OF REGIONAL EXPANSION OF

01:56:21.541 --> 01:56:24.411 region:rollup2
THE I SO. BUT THE PRACTICAL

01:56:23.276 --> 01:56:26.313 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS AND WHAT ARE THE

01:56:24.411 --> 01:56:27.814 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS.

01:56:26.313 --> 01:56:28.949 region:rollup2
HOW DOES IT AFFECT RATES HOW

01:56:27.814 --> 01:56:30.684 region:rollup2
DOES IT AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO

01:56:28.949 --> 01:56:32.752 region:rollup2
KEEP THE LIGHTS ON HOW DOES THAT

01:56:30.684 --> 01:56:34.654 region:rollup2
AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE MEET

01:56:32.752 --> 01:56:36.756 region:rollup2
THAT OUR POLICY OBJECTIVES? OF

01:56:34.654 --> 01:56:38.458 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:56:36.756 --> 01:56:39.693 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THINGS A THE MAIN

01:56:38.458 --> 01:56:41.228 region:rollup2
POINT I'D LIKE TO COMMUNICATE

01:56:39.693 --> 01:56:43.697 region:rollup2
AND TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY IS

01:56:41.228 --> 01:56:44.531 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:56:43.697 --> 01:56:46.566 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE IT SOMETIMES

01:56:44.531 --> 01:56:48.068 region:rollup2
CONFLATED NO STATUTORY.

01:56:46.566 --> 01:56:50.270 region:rollup2
.

01:56:48.068 --> 01:56:51.671 region:rollup2
CHANGES WITH NOTHING IS

01:56:50.270 --> 01:56:53.707 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IN IT INDUSTRY AND IN

01:56:51.671 --> 01:56:55.242 region:rollup2
FACT NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER IN

01:56:53.707 --> 01:56:57.310 region:rollup2
THE CHURCH THAN THE TRUTH.

01:56:55.242 --> 01:56:59.379 region:rollup2
THE I. SO SHOULD BE APPLAUDED

01:56:57.310 --> 01:57:01.515 region:rollup2
BY FOR ITS INNOVATIVE ENERGY

01:56:59.379 --> 01:57:03.149 region:rollup2
IMBALANCE MARKET AND I DON'T

01:57:01.515 --> 01:57:04.951 region:rollup2
THINK ANYONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT.

01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:06.353 region:rollup2
THAT IN A FEW SHORT YEARS YOU

01:57:04.951 --> 01:57:09.489 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE HAD.

01:57:06.353 --> 01:57:11.925 region:rollup2
ELEVEN ENTITIES A.

01:57:09.489 --> 01:57:14.227 region:rollup2
EITHER ALREADY PART OF THE

01:57:11.925 --> 01:57:15.562 region:rollup2
OPERATIONAL  <u><c.green>IBM. OR</c></u>

01:57:14.227 --> 01:57:18.265 region:rollup2
LOOKING TO BE PART OF THAT

01:57:15.562 --> 01:57:20.433 region:rollup2
OPERATION BY TWENTY TWENTY.

01:57:18.265 --> 01:57:21.968 region:rollup2
ON THAT IS AND A TREMENDOUS

01:57:20.433 --> 01:57:24.471 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHMENT IT'S AN ON

01:57:21.968 --> 01:57:26.606 region:rollup2
PARALLELED A AMOUNT OF REGIONAL

01:57:24.471 --> 01:57:28.408 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION. IDIOT AND IT'S

01:57:26.606 --> 01:57:30.644 region:rollup2
NOT JUST POLICY DECISIONS BY

01:57:28.408 --> 01:57:32.412 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVES BUT ALL THE SOFTWARE

01:57:30.644 --> 01:57:33.914 region:rollup2
AND TECHNOLOGY AND CHANGES TO

01:57:32.412 --> 01:57:35.382 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS THAT GO IN PLACE. TO

01:57:33.914 --> 01:57:37.384 region:rollup2
ALIGN THE OPERATION OF THE

01:57:35.382 --> 01:57:38.285 region:rollup2
ENTITIES ITS IT IS A VERY BIG

01:57:37.384 --> 01:57:40.487 region:rollup2
LEFT.

01:57:38.285 --> 01:57:42.255 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT SHOULD BE NOT GO

01:57:40.487 --> 01:57:43.256 region:rollup2
UNNOTICED.

01:57:42.255 --> 01:57:44.891 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ALSO NOT GO UNNOTICED

01:57:43.256 --> 01:57:46.793 region:rollup2
IS THAT.

01:57:44.891 --> 01:57:48.561 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE UP FOR PUBLIC POWER

01:57:46.793 --> 01:57:49.963 region:rollup2
ENTITIES FOR OF THE LARGEST

01:57:48.561 --> 01:57:51.565 region:rollup2
EIGHT PUBLIC POWER ENTITIES IN

01:57:49.963 --> 01:57:52.832 region:rollup2
THE UNITED STATES.

01:57:51.565 --> 01:57:54.701 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ON TRACK TO BECOME E. I

01:57:52.832 --> 01:57:56.603 region:rollup2
AM ENTITIES WHERE WE'RE SITTING

01:57:54.701 --> 01:57:58.071 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THE SACRAMENTO

01:57:56.603 --> 01:57:58.838 region:rollup2
MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT.

01:57:58.071 --> 01:58:00.473 region:rollup2
PART OF THE BALANCING OF THE

01:57:58.838 --> 01:58:02.075 region:rollup2
WORRY OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:58:00.473 --> 01:58:04.511 region:rollup2
WILL BECOME IS SET TO BECOME ANY

01:58:02.075 --> 01:58:05.378 region:rollup2
ID AND AN ENTITY. ARE

01:58:04.511 --> 01:58:07.814 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY THIS TIME NEXT

01:58:05.378 --> 01:58:09.349 region:rollup2
YEAR. HOT LOSANGELES DEPARTMENT

01:58:07.814 --> 01:58:11.051 region:rollup2
OF WATER AND POWER NOT SALT

01:58:09.349 --> 01:58:12.285 region:rollup2
RIVER PROJECT WHICH IS THE

01:58:11.051 --> 01:58:13.453 region:rollup2
PHOENIX AREA WHICH IS.

01:58:12.285 --> 01:58:15.021 region:rollup2
BASICALLY THE SAME SIZE AS

01:58:13.453 --> 01:58:16.890 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT WATER POWER.

01:58:15.021 --> 01:58:19.225 region:rollup2
AND THE CITY OF SEATTLE ARE ALL

01:58:16.890 --> 01:58:21.194 region:rollup2
SET TO GO WHEN IN A TWENTY

01:58:19.225 --> 01:58:23.697 region:rollup2
TWENTY OTHER CURRENT SCHEDULE.

01:58:21.194 --> 01:58:25.565 region:rollup2
SO THAT IS A BIG PARADIGM SHIFT

01:58:23.697 --> 01:58:27.334 region:rollup2
AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE AS A. PUP

01:58:25.565 --> 01:58:27.901 region:rollup2
AS A MARKET SEGMENT PUBLIC POWER

01:58:27.334 --> 01:58:29.903 region:rollup2
IS PROBABLY THE MOST CYNICAL

01:58:27.901 --> 01:58:31.504 region:rollup2
AND.

01:58:29.903 --> 01:58:34.574 region:rollup2
AND I SAW

01:58:31.504 --> 01:58:36.776 region:rollup2
SKEPTICAL AND CAUTIOUS.

01:58:34.574 --> 01:58:38.111 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO A THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:58:36.776 --> 01:58:39.679 region:rollup2
THESE REGION MARKET SO YOU SEEN

01:58:38.111 --> 01:58:42.048 region:rollup2
A CHANGE.

01:58:39.679 --> 01:58:43.650 region:rollup2
AND IF THE CHANGES DRIVEN BY THE

01:58:42.048 --> 01:58:44.884 region:rollup2
CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS AND THE

01:58:43.650 --> 01:58:46.319 region:rollup2
OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES THAT

01:58:44.884 --> 01:58:48.655 region:rollup2
THOSE AT DIS.

01:58:46.319 --> 01:58:49.823 region:rollup2
ARE ALL FACING PERHAPS NOT TO

01:58:48.655 --> 01:58:51.024 region:rollup2
THE SAME EXTENT THAT THE ISO WAS

01:58:49.823 --> 01:58:53.593 region:rollup2
FIXING BECAUSE OF THE AGGRESSIVE

01:58:51.024 --> 01:58:55.161 region:rollup2
POLICIES. THAT WE PUT IN PLACE

01:58:53.593 --> 01:58:56.196 region:rollup2
BUT IN ONE WAY SHAPE OR FORM SO

01:58:55.161 --> 01:58:58.064 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

01:58:56.196 --> 01:58:59.833 region:rollup2
IT'S A HARBINGER OF THE CHANGING

01:58:58.064 --> 01:59:02.602 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT NOT JUST HERE BUT

01:58:59.833 --> 01:59:03.870 region:rollup2
ELSEWHERE IN THE WEST.

01:59:02.602 --> 01:59:06.373 region:rollup2
THE I. AS IT WAS ALSO.

01:59:03.870 --> 01:59:08.108 region:rollup2
MAKING CHANGES TO ITS MARKET TO

01:59:06.373 --> 01:59:10.243 region:rollup2
BETTER INTEGRATE.

01:59:08.108 --> 01:59:12.579 region:rollup2
RENEWABLES AND THEN PROPOSING

01:59:10.243 --> 01:59:14.014 region:rollup2
TO EXTEND THOSE CHANGES INTO

01:59:12.579 --> 01:59:15.982 region:rollup2
THEIR DAY AHEAD MARKET AND

01:59:14.014 --> 01:59:17.384 region:rollup2
EXPAND THAT TO THE ENTIRE E. I

01:59:15.982 --> 01:59:19.686 region:rollup2
AM FOOTPRINT.

01:59:17.384 --> 01:59:22.555 region:rollup2
THIS IS GOING TO INVOKE A HOST

01:59:19.686 --> 01:59:23.857 region:rollup2
OF DIFFICULT POLICY AND CHOICES.

01:59:22.555 --> 01:59:25.925 region:rollup2
CITY STATE ASSOCIATED WITH

01:59:23.857 --> 01:59:27.660 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT RESOURCE

01:59:25.925 --> 01:59:28.928 region:rollup2
ADEQUACY IS MAINTAINED.

01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:30.730 region:rollup2
A WHETHER THERE ARE GOVERNMENTS

01:59:28.928 --> 01:59:31.898 region:rollup2
CHANGES THAT ARE NECESSARY HOW

01:59:30.730 --> 01:59:33.400 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION COSTS WILL BE

01:59:31.898 --> 01:59:36.503 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED.

01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:38.471 region:rollup2
I'M BUT A IT IT APPEARS TO BE

01:59:36.503 --> 01:59:39.706 region:rollup2
WELL ON ITS WAY IT APPEARS TO BE

01:59:38.471 --> 01:59:41.041 region:rollup2
HAPPENING. AND AT THAT POINT IN

01:59:39.706 --> 01:59:42.642 region:rollup2
TIME

01:59:41.041 --> 01:59:44.544 region:rollup2
THE VOLUMES THAT ARCHIE

01:59:42.642 --> 01:59:46.079 region:rollup2
EXCHANGED AND TREATED THROUGH

01:59:44.544 --> 01:59:48.381 region:rollup2
THE I SO CENTRALIZED MARKET WILL

01:59:46.079 --> 01:59:49.816 region:rollup2
GO UP BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS OVER

01:59:48.381 --> 01:59:51.685 region:rollup2
WHAT IS. CURRENTLY DONE IN THE

01:59:49.816 --> 01:59:52.986 region:rollup2
E. I. M. ALL THIS IS GOING TO

01:59:51.685 --> 01:59:55.555 region:rollup2
HAPPEN.

01:59:52.986 --> 01:59:56.890 region:rollup2
ON OR IS SET TO BE PROPOSED AND

01:59:55.555 --> 01:59:58.925 region:rollup2
IT IN MY OPINION IS LIKELY TO

01:59:56.890 --> 02:00:01.261 region:rollup2
HAPPEN.

01:59:58.925 --> 02:00:03.463 region:rollup2
WITHOUT STATUTORY A.

02:00:01.261 --> 02:00:05.031 region:rollup2
SO THE LAST DEVELOPMENT THAT'S

02:00:03.463 --> 02:00:07.600 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IS.

02:00:05.031 --> 02:00:09.402 region:rollup2
ON THE I SO IS HOLDING ITSELF

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:10.937 region:rollup2
OUT AS A PROVIDER OF RELIABILITY

02:00:09.402 --> 02:00:11.638 region:rollup2
SERVICES OR RELIABILITY

02:00:10.937 --> 02:00:13.206 region:rollup2
COORDINATOR SERVICES

02:00:11.638 --> 02:00:14.107 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY.

02:00:13.206 --> 02:00:16.142 region:rollup2
AND.

02:00:14.107 --> 02:00:17.544 region:rollup2
MANY THINGS CAN CHANGE BUT I

02:00:16.142 --> 02:00:19.145 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY THAT.

02:00:17.544 --> 02:00:20.914 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKELY THAT SIXTY FIVE OR

02:00:19.145 --> 02:00:22.382 region:rollup2
SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE DEMAND IN

02:00:20.914 --> 02:00:23.216 region:rollup2
THE WESTERN UNITED STATES WILL

02:00:22.382 --> 02:00:25.251 region:rollup2
TAKE RELIABILITY COORDINATOR

02:00:23.216 --> 02:00:26.586 region:rollup2
SERVICES FROM NASA.

02:00:25.251 --> 02:00:28.088 region:rollup2
SO NO ONE WOULD OF THOUGHT IN

02:00:26.586 --> 02:00:29.956 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ONLY WENT

02:00:28.088 --> 02:00:31.424 region:rollup2
DOWN THIS A PATH OF ENERGY

02:00:29.956 --> 02:00:32.625 region:rollup2
IMBALANCE MARKET THAT ANY OF

02:00:31.424 --> 02:00:34.527 region:rollup2
THIS THAT THIS KIND OF PROGRESS

02:00:32.625 --> 02:00:36.196 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS IS.

02:00:34.527 --> 02:00:37.397 region:rollup2
I SOMEONE ON A COLD A THAT WAS

02:00:36.196 --> 02:00:39.399 region:rollup2
ON YESTERDAY SAID THAT THE

02:00:37.397 --> 02:00:41.568 region:rollup2
WESTERN UNITED STATES ITS NEVER

02:00:39.399 --> 02:00:42.602 region:rollup2
MOVED. THIS QUICKLY A ASIT

02:00:41.568 --> 02:00:44.671 region:rollup2
RELATES TO CHANGES IN THE

02:00:42.602 --> 02:00:46.206 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY I WILL SAY THAT THAT'S

02:00:44.671 --> 02:00:47.674 region:rollup2
PERHAPS A LOW BAR.

02:00:46.206 --> 02:00:49.576 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE WE HAVE A CHIP MOVED

02:00:47.674 --> 02:00:52.745 region:rollup2
VERY QUICKLY OFTEN.

02:00:49.576 --> 02:00:53.279 region:rollup2
BUT THE EH BITE.

02:00:52.745 --> 02:00:56.483 region:rollup2
IRRESPECTIVE OF STATUTORY

02:00:53.279 --> 02:00:59.719 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

02:00:56.483 --> 02:01:01.855 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY ITSELF IS EVOLVING TO

02:00:59.719 --> 02:01:02.489 region:rollup2
TACKLE THE CHALLENGES THAT

02:01:01.855 --> 02:01:03.723 region:rollup2
MISTER RUFF LEADER HAS HAS LAID

02:01:02.489 --> 02:01:05.358 region:rollup2
OUT.

02:01:03.723 --> 02:01:07.660 region:rollup2
SO IN TWENTY TWENTY. WERE GONNA

02:01:05.358 --> 02:01:10.497 region:rollup2
HAVE AN E. I. M.. THAT IS LIKELY

02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:11.965 region:rollup2
TO BE WELL OVER HALF OF THE LOAD

02:01:10.497 --> 02:01:13.199 region:rollup2
IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES.

02:01:11.965 --> 02:01:15.201 region:rollup2
WE COULD HAVE BY THEN AN

02:01:13.199 --> 02:01:16.903 region:rollup2
EXTENSION THAT EXPANSION OF THEY

02:01:15.201 --> 02:01:18.538 region:rollup2
HAD MARKET FUNCTIONALITY TO

02:01:16.903 --> 02:01:20.306 region:rollup2
BETTER OPTIMIZE THE COMMITMENT

02:01:18.538 --> 02:01:21.775 region:rollup2
OF RESOURCES IN A FORWARD TIME

02:01:20.306 --> 02:01:23.276 region:rollup2
PERIOD. THAT.

02:01:21.775 --> 02:01:24.611 region:rollup2
IS THAT SCENE  <u><c.green>I AM</c></u>

02:01:23.276 --> 02:01:26.246 region:rollup2
FOOTPRINT OR PERHAPS EVEN A

02:01:24.611 --> 02:01:27.780 region:rollup2
SLIGHTLY BEYOND.

02:01:26.246 --> 02:01:29.082 region:rollup2
WELL HAVE WE COULD VERY WELL

02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:30.483 region:rollup2
HAVE SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE WEST

02:01:29.082 --> 02:01:32.118 region:rollup2
TAKING RELIABILITY SERVICES FROM

02:01:30.483 --> 02:01:33.019 region:rollup2
THE I SO.

02:01:32.118 --> 02:01:34.788 region:rollup2
THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

02:01:33.019 --> 02:01:36.389 region:rollup2
.

02:01:34.788 --> 02:01:38.758 region:rollup2
IN MY OPINION WITH OR WITHOUT.

02:01:36.389 --> 02:01:40.693 region:rollup2
GEORGE.

02:01:38.758 --> 02:01:42.495 region:rollup2
SO WORST WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT

02:01:40.693 --> 02:01:45.532 region:rollup2
THE I ESOS GOVERNANCE.

02:01:42.495 --> 02:01:46.132 region:rollup2
SORT OF IN THAT CONTEXT OF THE

02:01:45.532 --> 02:01:46.966 region:rollup2
EVOLUTION OF THE INDUSTRY AS A

02:01:46.132 --> 02:01:47.534 region:rollup2
WHOLE.

02:01:46.966 --> 02:01:49.802 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE

02:01:47.534 --> 02:01:50.937 region:rollup2
COME UP.

02:01:49.802 --> 02:01:51.905 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE I AGREE WITH MR

02:01:50.937 --> 02:01:53.139 region:rollup2
FRIEDMAN THIS IS A ONE WAY

02:01:51.905 --> 02:01:55.041 region:rollup2
TICKET AND SO THAT HEIGHTENS THE

02:01:53.139 --> 02:01:56.309 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE.

02:01:55.041 --> 02:01:57.710 region:rollup2
OF THE CHURCH OF THE DECISIONS

02:01:56.309 --> 02:01:59.045 region:rollup2
THAT WERE MAKING.

02:01:57.710 --> 02:02:01.381 region:rollup2
CHANGES THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE

02:01:59.045 --> 02:02:04.250 region:rollup2
AND PUT IN PLACE TO.

02:02:01.381 --> 02:02:05.685 region:rollup2
EXTRICATE A LARGE UTILITY FROM A

02:02:04.250 --> 02:02:07.420 region:rollup2
CENTRALIZED MARKET AND THE

02:02:05.685 --> 02:02:08.888 region:rollup2
LITIGATION THAT WOULD ENSUE.

02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:12.258 region:rollup2
ART ARE NOT TRIVIAL.

02:02:08.888 --> 02:02:13.359 region:rollup2
.

02:02:12.258 --> 02:02:13.993 region:rollup2
I DON'T AGREE WITH MISTER

02:02:13.359 --> 02:02:14.694 region:rollup2
FREEMAN THAT STATES WILL BE BIT

02:02:13.993 --> 02:02:16.796 region:rollup2
PLAYERS

02:02:14.694 --> 02:02:18.264 region:rollup2
STATES ARE NEVER BIT PLAYERS.

02:02:16.796 --> 02:02:19.966 region:rollup2
OUT WHILE THE LANGUAGE IN THE

02:02:18.264 --> 02:02:21.000 region:rollup2
BILL RIGHT NOW IS NOT A SPECIFIC

02:02:19.966 --> 02:02:23.403 region:rollup2
AS THE WHITE PAPERS THAT WERE

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:24.637 region:rollup2
PUT OUT IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN.

02:02:23.403 --> 02:02:26.706 region:rollup2
MY I ALWAYS VIEWED THAT AS JUST

02:02:24.637 --> 02:02:29.042 region:rollup2
DETAIL TO FALL.

02:02:26.706 --> 02:02:31.077 region:rollup2
STATES ARE NEVER BIT PLAYERS IN

02:02:29.042 --> 02:02:32.412 region:rollup2
OTHER ORGANIZED MARKETS STATES

02:02:31.077 --> 02:02:34.247 region:rollup2
HAVE MEANINGFUL ROLES

02:02:32.412 --> 02:02:36.382 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY ON ISSUES LIKE

02:02:34.247 --> 02:02:37.083 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION OST ALLOCATION.

02:02:36.382 --> 02:02:39.319 region:rollup2
AND.

02:02:37.083 --> 02:02:40.587 region:rollup2
PROCUREMENT ISSUES THAT CUT

02:02:39.319 --> 02:02:42.555 region:rollup2
ACROSS.

02:02:40.587 --> 02:02:45.425 region:rollup2
I STATE JURISDICTION.

02:02:42.555 --> 02:02:47.093 region:rollup2
SO.

02:02:45.425 --> 02:02:48.695 region:rollup2
WE NEED THINK HARD ABOUT THE

02:02:47.093 --> 02:02:49.295 region:rollup2
IMPACTS OF THOSE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:02:48.695 --> 02:02:50.230 region:rollup2
THINK THERE ARE SOLUTIONS OUT

02:02:49.295 --> 02:02:51.965 region:rollup2
THERE.

02:02:50.230 --> 02:02:53.800 region:rollup2
ON.

02:02:51.965 --> 02:02:56.869 region:rollup2
FINALLY AND.

02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:58.838 region:rollup2
A MISTER FRIEDMAN AND DISCUSS

THE OPTION OF HAVING CALIFORNIA.

AUTHORITIES JOIN THE ISO AS A

02:03:01.507 --> 02:03:04.444 region:rollup2
MENTIONED YOU HAVE.

BY A LARGE MARGIN.

02:03:11.451 --> 02:03:16.222 region:rollup2
ALREADY SET TO BECOME E. I

02:03:13.853 --> 02:03:18.625 region:rollup2
AMENITIES BUT BEYOND THAT.

02:03:16.222 --> 02:03:20.526 region:rollup2
NEVER BEEN AN ISSUE OF.

02:03:18.625 --> 02:03:22.362 region:rollup2
A PHILOSOPHICAL OBJECTION.

02:03:20.526 --> 02:03:24.030 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN IN ISSUE OF. WHERE THE

02:03:22.362 --> 02:03:24.564 region:rollup2
DOLLARS AND CENTS AND THE

02:03:24.030 --> 02:03:25.865 region:rollup2
IMPACTS ON LOCAL DECISION

02:03:24.564 --> 02:03:28.568 region:rollup2
MAKING?

02:03:25.865 --> 02:03:30.036 region:rollup2
AND SO THOSE DOES.

02:03:28.568 --> 02:03:31.905 region:rollup2
COST BENEFIT ANALYSES ARE ALWAYS

02:03:30.036 --> 02:03:35.475 region:rollup2
ON GOING.

02:03:31.905 --> 02:03:37.543 region:rollup2
AND WHEN. WE LOOK AT A IT IN

02:03:35.475 --> 02:03:38.311 region:rollup2
TERMS OF.

02:03:37.543 --> 02:03:40.213 region:rollup2
SHOULD WE JOIN THE AYSO WHICH A

02:03:38.311 --> 02:03:42.015 region:rollup2
PTO DESPAIN TRANSMISSION ARE

02:03:40.213 --> 02:03:44.150 region:rollup2
IT'S WELL THAT DO LOWER RATES

02:03:42.015 --> 02:03:45.018 region:rollup2
WHAT WILL THAT DO TO OUR ABILITY

02:03:44.150 --> 02:03:45.985 region:rollup2
TO MAINTAIN AND.

02:03:45.018 --> 02:03:47.520 region:rollup2
A DECISION MAKING OVER OUR

RESOURCES.

02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:50.723 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE BALANCING ITS NOT TO

02:03:49.722 --> 02:03:52.792 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT

02:03:50.723 --> 02:03:55.561 region:rollup2
THERE IS BEYOND BACK THAT WOULD

02:03:52.792 --> 02:03:56.796 region:rollup2
NEED TO. TAKE PLACE THAT WOULD A

02:03:55.561 --> 02:03:58.498 region:rollup2
MOVE IN THE DIRECTION THAT

02:03:56.796 --> 02:04:01.301 region:rollup2
MISTER FRIEDMAN SUGGEST.

02:03:58.498 --> 02:04:02.468 region:rollup2
SO BATS A GENERALLY WHAT HAD

02:04:01.301 --> 02:04:04.337 region:rollup2
FOR YOU TODAY THERE'S A LOT

02:04:02.468 --> 02:04:06.172 region:rollup2
GOING ON HARDLY THE INDUSTRY CAN

02:04:04.337 --> 02:04:07.440 region:rollup2
HARDLY KEEP UP.

02:04:06.172 --> 02:04:08.741 region:rollup2
R. THAT'S GOING THAT PACE OF

02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:09.842 region:rollup2
CHANGE IS GOING TO HAPPEN

02:04:08.741 --> 02:04:11.110 region:rollup2
IRRESPECTIVE

02:04:09.842 --> 02:04:12.512 region:rollup2
OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THE

02:04:11.110 --> 02:04:13.746 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR.

02:04:12.512 --> 02:04:16.449 region:rollup2
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING

02:04:13.746 --> 02:04:17.784 region:rollup2
WITH YOU ON HOWEVER THAT JUST

02:04:16.449 --> 02:04:20.053 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT'S DISCUSSION FOR THE

02:04:17.784 --> 02:04:21.287 region:rollup2
ISA CONTINUES.

02:04:20.053 --> 02:04:22.822 region:rollup2
WELL THANK YOU I APPRECIATE ALL

02:04:21.287 --> 02:04:24.424 region:rollup2
OF YOU AND YOUR PRESENTATIONS

02:04:22.822 --> 02:04:25.758 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY.

02:04:24.424 --> 02:04:28.127 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WILL BE THE FIRST TO

02:04:25.758 --> 02:04:29.595 region:rollup2
SAY WE FEEL. OF THE CHANGE

02:04:28.127 --> 02:04:30.830 region:rollup2
REFILL HOW RAPIDLY THINGS ARE

02:04:29.595 --> 02:04:33.266 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IN THE MARKETPLACE

02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:33.766 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT FINDS ITS WAY TO THIS

02:04:33.266 --> 02:04:34.534 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE IN ONE FORM OR

02:04:33.766 --> 02:04:36.569 region:rollup2
ANOTHER.

02:04:34.534 --> 02:04:37.904 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO RECOGNIZE

02:04:36.569 --> 02:04:39.939 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT THE

02:04:37.904 --> 02:04:41.574 region:rollup2
CONCEPT OF RACIALIZATION COULD

02:04:39.939 --> 02:04:43.209 region:rollup2
MEAN IN TERMS OF OUR FUTURE.

02:04:41.574 --> 02:04:44.911 region:rollup2
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:04:43.209 --> 02:04:46.179 region:rollup2
HAD A PROCESS ONE THAT WAS

02:04:44.911 --> 02:04:48.614 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENT ONE THAT WAS

02:04:46.179 --> 02:04:49.649 region:rollup2
DELIBERATE ONE THAT ALLOWED FOR.

02:04:48.614 --> 02:04:51.384 region:rollup2
THE SHARING OF A VARIETY OF

02:04:49.649 --> 02:04:52.752 region:rollup2
IDEAS AND AS YOU CAN HEAR JUST

02:04:51.384 --> 02:04:54.387 region:rollup2
IN THIS PANEL ALONG HERE ARE.

02:04:52.752 --> 02:04:55.088 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEWS ON

02:04:54.387 --> 02:04:57.523 region:rollup2
WHAT.

02:04:55.088 --> 02:04:59.292 region:rollup2
A REALIZE MARKET MAY MEAN.

02:04:57.523 --> 02:05:00.593 region:rollup2
TO THE FUTURE OF THE RATE

02:04:59.292 --> 02:05:01.427 region:rollup2
PAYERS IN CALIFORNIA SO WE DO

02:05:00.593 --> 02:05:02.762 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

02:05:01.427 --> 02:05:03.896 region:rollup2
DOING THE RIGHT THING IN MOVING

02:05:02.762 --> 02:05:05.565 region:rollup2
AT THE RIGHT SPEED AND TAKING

02:05:03.896 --> 02:05:07.133 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT INFORMATION AND. I DID

02:05:05.565 --> 02:05:09.235 region:rollup2
WANNA AND I'LL TURN TO OTHER

02:05:07.133 --> 02:05:09.902 region:rollup2
MEMBERS BY DO WANT TO ASK A

02:05:09.235 --> 02:05:11.738 region:rollup2
QUESTION REALLY TO.

02:05:09.902 --> 02:05:13.473 region:rollup2
TO GET.

02:05:11.738 --> 02:05:14.540 region:rollup2
MISS WHISTLING YOUR.

02:05:13.473 --> 02:05:18.044 region:rollup2
HE RESPONSE.

02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:20.313 region:rollup2
TO MISTER MISTER FRIEDMAN'S.

02:05:18.044 --> 02:05:21.381 region:rollup2
SUGGESTION ABOUT THE POLICIES

02:05:20.313 --> 02:05:23.583 region:rollup2
AND.

02:05:21.381 --> 02:05:27.020 region:rollup2
CONFLICTING POLICIES I THOUGHT

02:05:23.583 --> 02:05:28.955 region:rollup2
IN YOUR PRESENTATION WAS. A. A

02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:29.822 region:rollup2
REFERENCE TO.

02:05:28.955 --> 02:05:32.125 region:rollup2
I ESPECIALLY AS YOU LOOK AT.

02:05:29.822 --> 02:05:33.426 region:rollup2
.

02:05:32.125 --> 02:05:34.694 region:rollup2
ENERGY THAT'S COMING IN FROM

02:05:33.426 --> 02:05:36.396 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES HOW THAT'S GOING TO

02:05:34.694 --> 02:05:39.265 region:rollup2
BE PRICED AND WHAT THE IMPACT

02:05:36.396 --> 02:05:40.600 region:rollup2
COULD BE TO OUR POLICIES IN.

02:05:39.265 --> 02:05:41.634 region:rollup2
TERMS OF A THE RENEWABLE

02:05:40.600 --> 02:05:42.769 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES THAT WE'VE ALREADY

02:05:41.634 --> 02:05:43.936 region:rollup2
PUT IN PLACE AND HOW

02:05:42.769 --> 02:05:45.671 region:rollup2
REGIONALIZATION CREATES A

02:05:43.936 --> 02:05:46.973 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT KIND OF OPPORTUNITY

02:05:45.671 --> 02:05:49.742 region:rollup2
AND NO IN THE BILL WE HAVE

02:05:46.973 --> 02:05:51.210 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS FOR GHG TRACKING.

02:05:49.742 --> 02:05:53.312 region:rollup2
CANOE KIND OF THE LOOT.

02:05:51.210 --> 02:05:54.147 region:rollup2
EXPAND ON THAT A LITTLE BIT IN

02:05:53.312 --> 02:05:55.415 region:rollup2
TERMS OF.

02:05:54.147 --> 02:05:56.382 region:rollup2
POLICIES AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS

02:05:55.415 --> 02:05:58.351 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:05:56.382 --> 02:06:03.022 region:rollup2
WELL I.

02:05:58.351 --> 02:06:03.022 region:rollup2
SHIRT LET ME.

02:06:03.089 --> 02:06:06.726 region:rollup2
ONE THING THAT COMES TO MIND SO.

02:06:04.791 --> 02:06:07.927 region:rollup2
MATT DID MENTION THAT HE HE

02:06:06.726 --> 02:06:09.195 region:rollup2
FEELS THAT THE OUR PS WOULD BE

02:06:07.927 --> 02:06:10.596 region:rollup2
IN JEOPARDY IF WE WERE TO MOVE

02:06:09.195 --> 02:06:11.998 region:rollup2
TO A WESTERN REGIONAL ENERGY

02:06:10.596 --> 02:06:14.033 region:rollup2
MARKET AND SO.

02:06:11.998 --> 02:06:14.901 region:rollup2
I SIMPLY TALKING ABOUT IS THAT

02:06:14.033 --> 02:06:15.701 region:rollup2
THE WAY THE RPF THE STRUCTURED

02:06:14.901 --> 02:06:17.737 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THERE.

02:06:15.701 --> 02:06:19.305 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN EMPHASIS ON

02:06:17.737 --> 02:06:21.374 region:rollup2
PURCHASING ELECTRICITY THAT IS

02:06:19.305 --> 02:06:23.109 region:rollup2
EITHER LOCATED INSIDE THE STATE

02:06:21.374 --> 02:06:24.610 region:rollup2
OF ARE ACTUALLY SORRY NOT ONLY

02:06:23.109 --> 02:06:25.211 region:rollup2
LOCATED INSIDE CALIFORNIA

02:06:24.610 --> 02:06:27.447 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT WOULD VIOLATE THE

02:06:25.211 --> 02:06:29.315 region:rollup2
COMMERCE CLAUSE. BUT IS DIRECTLY

02:06:27.447 --> 02:06:31.083 region:rollup2
INTERCONNECTED TO THE CAL I SO

02:06:29.315 --> 02:06:32.919 region:rollup2
OR IF IT'S NOT I CAN BE.

02:06:31.083 --> 02:06:33.886 region:rollup2
.

02:06:32.919 --> 02:06:36.389 region:rollup2
CAN BE TRANSMITTED IN ON AN

02:06:33.886 --> 02:06:38.558 region:rollup2
HOURLY BASIS AND COUNTED AS SUCH

02:06:36.389 --> 02:06:41.160 region:rollup2
AND IF WE WERE TO EXPAND TO A

02:06:38.558 --> 02:06:43.062 region:rollup2
WESTERN AYE SO. THEN ANYTHING

02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:44.497 region:rollup2
THAT'S DIRECTLY INTERCONNECTED

02:06:43.062 --> 02:06:46.599 region:rollup2
INTO THE WESTERN AYE SO NOT JUST

02:06:44.497 --> 02:06:49.001 region:rollup2
THE CAL I SO WOULD BE CONSIDERED

02:06:46.599 --> 02:06:51.437 region:rollup2
BUCKET ONE AND SO. IN EFFECT IT

02:06:49.001 --> 02:06:53.272 region:rollup2
WOULD PUT LESS OF AN EMPHASIS ON

02:06:51.437 --> 02:06:55.575 region:rollup2
THE REMAINING PROCUREMENT WE

02:06:53.272 --> 02:06:57.176 region:rollup2
NEED TO DO UNDER THE CURRENT OUR

02:06:55.575 --> 02:06:59.278 region:rollup2
PS REQUIREMENT.

02:06:57.176 --> 02:07:00.980 region:rollup2
TO BUILD PROJECTS IN STATES.

02:06:59.278 --> 02:07:02.548 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T DENY THAT THAT'S A

02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:05.418 region:rollup2
RISK BUT I GUESS THE THING THAT

02:07:02.548 --> 02:07:06.919 region:rollup2
I THINK ABOUT IS NUMBER ONE.

02:07:05.418 --> 02:07:08.521 region:rollup2
A LOT OF PROCUREMENT HAS ALREADY

02:07:06.919 --> 02:07:09.422 region:rollup2
HAPPENED TO ME THAT FIFTY

02:07:08.521 --> 02:07:10.723 region:rollup2
PERCENT AND IT'S ALREADY LOCKED

02:07:09.422 --> 02:07:12.258 region:rollup2
DAN.

02:07:10.723 --> 02:07:12.792 region:rollup2
THE BULK OF REMAINING

02:07:12.258 --> 02:07:13.826 region:rollup2
PROCUREMENT THAT NEEDS TO

02:07:12.792 --> 02:07:15.394 region:rollup2
HAPPEN.

02:07:13.826 --> 02:07:16.929 region:rollup2
I THINK IS TO BE DONE BY THE

02:07:15.394 --> 02:07:19.132 region:rollup2
CCA'S

02:07:16.929 --> 02:07:20.867 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS

02:07:19.132 --> 02:07:22.468 region:rollup2
THE CCA'S HAVE BEEN VERY.

02:07:20.867 --> 02:07:23.870 region:rollup2
OUTSPOKEN AND AND IN FACT

02:07:22.468 --> 02:07:26.372 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF PUBLIC PRESSURE

02:07:23.870 --> 02:07:27.707 region:rollup2
ON THEM TO DO AS MUCH IN STATE

02:07:26.372 --> 02:07:28.941 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT AS POSSIBLE

02:07:27.707 --> 02:07:31.010 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE DOING OTHER

02:07:28.941 --> 02:07:32.378 region:rollup2
THINGS TO. KEEP THEIR OPTIONS

02:07:31.010 --> 02:07:34.514 region:rollup2
OPEN BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE

02:07:32.378 --> 02:07:36.816 region:rollup2
ARE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO PUT A

02:07:34.514 --> 02:07:38.918 region:rollup2
THUMB ON THE SCALE FOR IN STATE

02:07:36.816 --> 02:07:40.620 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT EVEN IF IT'S NOT.

02:07:38.918 --> 02:07:41.587 region:rollup2
THE RP ES THAT'S DOING THAT.

02:07:40.620 --> 02:07:44.123 region:rollup2
I ALSO THINK THAT WE'VE

02:07:41.587 --> 02:07:46.425 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE OUR PS IS

02:07:44.123 --> 02:07:48.828 region:rollup2
BECOMING LESS AND LESS OF THE

02:07:46.425 --> 02:07:50.129 region:rollup2
TOOL WE'RE GONNA USE TO DRIVE

02:07:48.828 --> 02:07:51.664 region:rollup2
RENEWABLE PROCUREMENT IN THE

02:07:50.129 --> 02:07:52.932 region:rollup2
FUTURE SO.

02:07:51.664 --> 02:07:54.333 region:rollup2
MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT IT

02:07:52.932 --> 02:07:55.935 region:rollup2
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO DO AN

02:07:54.333 --> 02:07:57.737 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT ARE PS FOR EVERY

02:07:55.935 --> 02:07:59.138 region:rollup2
UTILITY. LOAD SERVING ENTITY IN

02:07:57.737 --> 02:08:00.139 region:rollup2
THE STATE WE ARE GONNA HAVE TO

02:07:59.138 --> 02:08:01.440 region:rollup2
MOVE TO SOMETHING THAT'S A

02:08:00.139 --> 02:08:03.743 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBLE.

02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:04.877 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO BE MORE

02:08:03.743 --> 02:08:07.046 region:rollup2
FLEXIBLE TO ACCOMMODATE ALL

02:08:04.877 --> 02:08:09.081 region:rollup2
THESE RENEWABLES AND SO I THINK

02:08:07.046 --> 02:08:10.283 region:rollup2
THAT. IT'S BEEN IT THE WAY WE

02:08:09.081 --> 02:08:11.717 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE THE OUR PS HAS BEEN A

02:08:10.283 --> 02:08:12.785 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT AND EFFECTIVE

02:08:11.717 --> 02:08:15.321 region:rollup2
WAY TO DRIVE IN STATE

02:08:12.785 --> 02:08:15.888 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT THAT. IS GOING TO

02:08:15.321 --> 02:08:16.789 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO HAPPEN NO MATTER

02:08:15.888 --> 02:08:19.325 region:rollup2
WHAT.

02:08:16.789 --> 02:08:20.927 region:rollup2
AND IN MY MIND THE BENEFITS OF A

02:08:19.325 --> 02:08:22.628 region:rollup2
REGIONAL GRADE TO.

02:08:20.927 --> 02:08:25.064 region:rollup2
BRINGING RENEWABLES ONLINE

02:08:22.628 --> 02:08:27.099 region:rollup2
FASTER MORE COST EFFECTIVELY.

02:08:25.064 --> 02:08:28.968 region:rollup2
OUT WAYS.

02:08:27.099 --> 02:08:30.670 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNS THAT WE'RE NOT

02:08:28.968 --> 02:08:31.170 region:rollup2
GONNA GET QUITE AS MUCH IN STATE

02:08:30.670 --> 02:08:35.274 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT AS WE WOULD

02:08:31.170 --> 02:08:38.778 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE.

02:08:35.274 --> 02:08:41.447 region:rollup2
S. PURSUIT.

02:08:38.778 --> 02:08:42.748 region:rollup2
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR.

02:08:41.447 --> 02:08:45.618 region:rollup2
ANY OF THE OTHER PANELISTS

02:08:42.748 --> 02:08:45.918 region:rollup2
RESPOND TO MISTER FRIEDMAN SIR.

02:08:45.618 --> 02:08:47.153 region:rollup2
STERN ABOUT.

02:08:45.918 --> 02:08:49.322 region:rollup2
.

02:08:47.153 --> 02:08:51.857 region:rollup2
HOW THE WESTERN REGIONALIZATION

02:08:49.322 --> 02:08:54.360 region:rollup2
WOULD? STRENGTHEN THE CASE FOR

02:08:51.857 --> 02:08:55.661 region:rollup2
FEDERAL PREEMPTION.

02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:59.599 region:rollup2
IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT.

02:08:55.661 --> 02:09:01.801 region:rollup2
ANY.

02:08:59.599 --> 02:09:02.835 region:rollup2
REFORM THAT THAT.

02:09:01.801 --> 02:09:04.904 region:rollup2
TAKE THIS FURTHER IN THE

02:09:02.835 --> 02:09:07.440 region:rollup2
DIRECTION.

02:09:04.904 --> 02:09:09.742 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENTS

02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:11.744 region:rollup2
TO ENTER STATE GOVERNMENTS.

02:09:09.742 --> 02:09:13.346 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO ONLY STRENGTHEN.

02:09:11.744 --> 02:09:15.081 region:rollup2
A CASE FOR FEDERAL PREEMPTION

02:09:13.346 --> 02:09:16.415 region:rollup2
AND FEDERAL AN INTERVENTION.

02:09:15.081 --> 02:09:18.184 region:rollup2
WHICH YOU KNOW I HAVE AS WE'VE

02:09:16.415 --> 02:09:19.418 region:rollup2
SEEN THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

02:09:18.184 --> 02:09:21.554 region:rollup2
WELL WE HAVE A HOSTILE

02:09:19.418 --> 02:09:23.356 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION.

02:09:21.554 --> 02:09:26.692 region:rollup2
TO CALIFORNIA'S POLICIES.

02:09:23.356 --> 02:09:27.860 region:rollup2
HOW THAT WOULD NOT?

02:09:26.692 --> 02:09:30.062 region:rollup2
OPEN UP THE DOOR TO THE

02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:31.731 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL FOR. THE COMPLETE

02:09:30.062 --> 02:09:34.367 region:rollup2
GUTTING OF ALL OF OUR.

02:09:31.731 --> 02:09:36.168 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS AND.

02:09:34.367 --> 02:09:37.370 region:rollup2
POLLUTION EFFORTS THAT WERE

02:09:36.168 --> 02:09:39.238 region:rollup2
SURPRISED AT HEARING IN THE

02:09:37.370 --> 02:09:42.041 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:09:39.238 --> 02:09:42.742 region:rollup2
IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO THAT.

02:09:42.041 --> 02:09:44.477 region:rollup2
IT'S POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO DO

02:09:42.742 --> 02:09:47.046 region:rollup2
THAT NOW.

02:09:44.477 --> 02:09:48.447 region:rollup2
NOTHING CHANGES THE FACT THAT

02:09:47.046 --> 02:09:51.550 region:rollup2
THE GUY CALIFORNIA'S.

02:09:48.447 --> 02:09:53.686 region:rollup2
POLICIES ARE SUBJECT TO A COMP

02:09:51.550 --> 02:09:55.054 region:rollup2
ARE SUBJECT TO COMMERCE CLAUSE

02:09:53.686 --> 02:09:56.822 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S BEEN THE CASE SINCE

02:09:55.054 --> 02:09:58.424 region:rollup2
SEPTEMBER NINE EIGHTEEN FIFTY

02:09:56.822 --> 02:10:00.192 region:rollup2
WHEN WE JOINED THE UNION THAT

02:09:58.424 --> 02:10:02.828 region:rollup2
THE COMMERCE CLAUSE SUPPLIES SO.

02:10:00.192 --> 02:10:04.096 region:rollup2
IF OUR POLICIES CONFLICT WITH

02:10:02.828 --> 02:10:05.898 region:rollup2
THE COMMERCE CLAUSE AND SO WE

02:10:04.096 --> 02:10:07.166 region:rollup2
CAN MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT. YOU

02:10:05.898 --> 02:10:08.968 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT'S THE CASE.

02:10:07.166 --> 02:10:10.236 region:rollup2
THEN THAT'S A PROBLEM BUT

02:10:08.968 --> 02:10:11.771 region:rollup2
THAT'S A PROBLEM TODAY SURE I

02:10:10.236 --> 02:10:13.606 region:rollup2
WHETHER WE'VE D. WHETHER ALASKA

02:10:11.771 --> 02:10:15.675 region:rollup2
JOINS US OR WHETHER NEVADA JOINS

02:10:13.606 --> 02:10:17.343 region:rollup2
US IT'S STILL A PROBLEM. TODAY

02:10:15.675 --> 02:10:17.910 region:rollup2
LIKEWISE UNDER THE FEDERAL POWER

02:10:17.343 --> 02:10:20.246 region:rollup2
ACT.

02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:22.114 region:rollup2
WE ARE SUBJECT TO.

02:10:20.246 --> 02:10:22.982 region:rollup2
TODAY.

02:10:22.114 --> 02:10:25.217 region:rollup2
WITH THE SINGLE.

02:10:22.982 --> 02:10:26.752 region:rollup2
WITH A SINGLE STATE AYE SO AYE

02:10:25.217 --> 02:10:28.320 region:rollup2
AND WE WERE SUBJECT TO THE

02:10:26.752 --> 02:10:29.822 region:rollup2
FEDERAL POWER ACT PRIOR TO PRIOR

02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:31.924 region:rollup2
TO THE EYES OF I WAS ON THE

02:10:29.822 --> 02:10:32.925 region:rollup2
LOSING END OF LITIGATION. AND

02:10:31.924 --> 02:10:33.159 region:rollup2
NINETEEN NINETY FIVE ON THAT

02:10:32.925 --> 02:10:35.928 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

02:10:33.159 --> 02:10:37.496 region:rollup2
IT IF YOU'RE IF YOU IF YOU'RE A

02:10:35.928 --> 02:10:39.031 region:rollup2
DOT CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL

02:10:37.496 --> 02:10:40.599 region:rollup2
POWER ACT YOU'RE YOU'RE EXPOSED

02:10:39.031 --> 02:10:43.202 region:rollup2
AS WELL. MISTER.

02:10:40.599 --> 02:10:43.869 region:rollup2
FRIEDMAN RAISED A HUGE CASE

02:10:43.202 --> 02:10:44.737 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS A MARYLAND CASE

02:10:43.869 --> 02:10:46.072 region:rollup2
AND THE SUPREME COURT WENT OUT

02:10:44.737 --> 02:10:48.174 region:rollup2
OF THEIR WAY IN THAT CASE TO SAY

02:10:46.072 --> 02:10:49.375 region:rollup2
WAS VERY NARROW WHAT THEY WERE

02:10:48.174 --> 02:10:51.043 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD THEY WERE FOCUSED ON

02:10:49.375 --> 02:10:52.945 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS BASICALLY. A THE FACT

02:10:51.043 --> 02:10:54.146 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THAT THESE WERE NOT

02:10:52.945 --> 02:10:55.147 region:rollup2
BILATERAL CONTRACTS.

02:10:54.146 --> 02:10:57.450 region:rollup2
THERE WOULD NORMALLY BE.

02:10:55.147 --> 02:10:59.318 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE BETWEEN TWO PARTIES

02:10:57.450 --> 02:11:01.687 region:rollup2
BUT THAT THIS STATE TRIED TO

02:10:59.318 --> 02:11:01.887 region:rollup2
TIED THEIR POLICY TO SOMETHING

02:11:01.687 --> 02:11:04.223 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:11:01.887 --> 02:11:05.725 region:rollup2
TO TO A FORK RATE AND THAT'S

02:11:04.223 --> 02:11:07.860 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE ONE THING THAT SET

02:11:05.725 --> 02:11:09.695 region:rollup2
OFF A THAT PROBLEM WE HAVE

02:11:07.860 --> 02:11:10.930 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS IF NOT THE A WITH

02:11:09.695 --> 02:11:12.365 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF CONTRACTS.

02:11:10.930 --> 02:11:13.799 region:rollup2
THAT ARE HONORED WITH RESPECT

02:11:12.365 --> 02:11:15.401 region:rollup2
TO RENEWABLE CONTRACTS WITH

02:11:13.799 --> 02:11:17.503 region:rollup2
GREAT RESPECT GAS CONTRACTS.

02:11:15.401 --> 02:11:18.437 region:rollup2
RESPECTED ALL KINDS OF THINGS

02:11:17.503 --> 02:11:20.306 region:rollup2
THAT ARE DIRE NOT IMPACTED BY

02:11:18.437 --> 02:11:22.508 region:rollup2
THAT SO I DON'T SEE THAT THERE'S

02:11:20.306 --> 02:11:24.710 region:rollup2
ANY RISK ADDITIONAL RISK THAT OF

02:11:22.508 --> 02:11:27.246 region:rollup2
HAVING THE MULTISTATE BODY.

02:11:24.710 --> 02:11:29.115 region:rollup2
OR MULTI JURISDICTIONAL BODY.

02:11:27.246 --> 02:11:29.982 region:rollup2
THEN WE ARE ALREADY FACE I

02:11:29.115 --> 02:11:32.418 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S AT THE HEART OF THE

02:11:29.982 --> 02:11:34.854 region:rollup2
DISPUTED THAT THE TWO OF US ARE

02:11:32.418 --> 02:11:36.455 region:rollup2
HAVING. BUT I JUST DON'T SEE IT.

02:11:34.854 --> 02:11:38.157 region:rollup2
I I JUST WELL I I JUST DON'T

02:11:36.455 --> 02:11:39.525 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND MEN UNDERSTAND THAT

02:11:38.157 --> 02:11:41.093 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THE SUBJECT TO

02:11:39.525 --> 02:11:42.461 region:rollup2
LITIGATION JUST AS WE'VE SEEN.

02:11:41.093 --> 02:11:42.928 region:rollup2
WITH OUR A.

02:11:42.461 --> 02:11:44.697 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

02:11:42.928 --> 02:11:45.598 region:rollup2
SANCTUARY STATE LAWS BEING

02:11:44.697 --> 02:11:47.666 region:rollup2
CHALLENGED BY THE NEW UNITED

02:11:45.598 --> 02:11:49.468 region:rollup2
STATES DEPARTMENT JUSTICE BUT IT

02:11:47.666 --> 02:11:51.337 region:rollup2
SEEMS LIKE ANY DIRECTION. BY AND

02:11:49.468 --> 02:11:52.938 region:rollup2
A ANY MOVEMENT TOWARD A MULTI

02:11:51.337 --> 02:11:55.441 region:rollup2
STATE.

02:11:52.938 --> 02:11:57.143 region:rollup2
GOVERNING STRUCTURE WHICH ONLY.

02:11:55.441 --> 02:11:59.979 region:rollup2
MAKE THE FEDERAL CASE STRONGER

02:11:57.143 --> 02:12:01.680 region:rollup2
FOR PREMIUMS.

02:11:59.979 --> 02:12:02.982 region:rollup2
IT'S HARDY PRODUCED.

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:04.650 region:rollup2
DID EXTENT IT'S IT'S A STRONG

02:12:02.982 --> 02:12:05.951 region:rollup2
CASE UNDER UP LET'S USE THE

02:12:04.650 --> 02:12:07.186 region:rollup2
FEDERAL POWER ACT.

02:12:05.951 --> 02:12:08.988 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO BE A STRONG CASE

02:12:07.186 --> 02:12:10.356 region:rollup2
THAT AS I SAID REGARDLESS OF

02:12:08.988 --> 02:12:12.158 region:rollup2
WHETHER NEVADA'S IN IT OR NOT.

02:12:10.356 --> 02:12:13.659 region:rollup2
OKAY IF IT'S VIOLATING THE

02:12:12.158 --> 02:12:15.761 region:rollup2
FEDERAL OF FEDERAL POWER ACT

02:12:13.659 --> 02:12:15.961 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM.

02:12:15.761 --> 02:12:17.329 region:rollup2
AND.

02:12:15.961 --> 02:12:19.098 region:rollup2
AYE AYE THOUGH IF YOU WOULD

02:12:17.329 --> 02:12:20.666 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU. WHEN IT WHEN I'M

02:12:19.098 --> 02:12:21.834 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE OTHER CASES THAT

02:12:20.666 --> 02:12:23.803 region:rollup2
OF POPPED UP NATIONALLY AYE THE

02:12:21.834 --> 02:12:25.938 region:rollup2
DEITIES NORMALLY DON'T HINGE ON

02:12:23.803 --> 02:12:27.173 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT. IT IT IT'S MULTI

02:12:25.938 --> 02:12:28.874 region:rollup2
STATE OR NOT TURNS OUT THAT

02:12:27.173 --> 02:12:32.311 region:rollup2
WHERE WE AND NEW YORK ARE THE

02:12:28.874 --> 02:12:33.379 region:rollup2
ONLY TWO SINGLE STATE ARTIOS.

02:12:32.311 --> 02:12:34.280 region:rollup2
SO THERE THERE IT IS THERE IS

02:12:33.379 --> 02:12:37.016 region:rollup2
AN IMPACT THERE'S SAID TO FAIRLY

02:12:34.280 --> 02:12:38.450 region:rollup2
SMALL COMMUNITY OF A OF ENTITIES

02:12:37.016 --> 02:12:41.887 region:rollup2
BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S A.

02:12:38.450 --> 02:12:43.722 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION BETWEEN MULTI STATE.

02:12:41.887 --> 02:12:45.124 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW POWER TRANSMISSION OR

02:12:43.722 --> 02:12:47.593 region:rollup2
OUR POWER PROCUREMENT.

02:12:45.124 --> 02:12:49.061 region:rollup2
VERSES MULTI STATE GOVERNMENTS.

02:12:47.593 --> 02:12:50.663 region:rollup2
AND AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

02:12:49.061 --> 02:12:51.897 region:rollup2
THAT AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG

02:12:50.663 --> 02:12:53.599 region:rollup2
MISTER FRIEDMAN BUT MY IS MY

02:12:51.897 --> 02:12:54.867 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THAT. THIS EFFORT

02:12:53.599 --> 02:12:56.769 region:rollup2
IS.

02:12:54.867 --> 02:12:57.336 region:rollup2
SEEKING TO TAKE THE GOVERNMENT

02:12:56.769 --> 02:12:58.437 region:rollup2
AND GOVERNMENTS FROM AS YOU

02:12:57.336 --> 02:12:59.472 region:rollup2
INDICATED.

02:12:58.437 --> 02:13:01.207 region:rollup2
THE APPOINTMENTS.

02:12:59.472 --> 02:13:02.475 region:rollup2
BY OUR GOVERNOR AND OUR STATE

02:13:01.207 --> 02:13:04.076 region:rollup2
SENATE.

02:13:02.475 --> 02:13:08.380 region:rollup2
TO A MULTI STATE GOVERNANCE

02:13:04.076 --> 02:13:09.582 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE.

02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:11.250 region:rollup2
IF I MAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON IT

02:13:09.582 --> 02:13:12.918 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IS IN A MULTI STATE

02:13:11.250 --> 02:13:13.385 region:rollup2
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IT IS NOT

02:13:12.918 --> 02:13:14.620 region:rollup2
TETHERED TO ANY STATE

02:13:13.385 --> 02:13:16.322 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

02:13:14.620 --> 02:13:19.091 region:rollup2
UNDER THE PROPOSAL IT WOULD BE

02:13:16.322 --> 02:13:20.593 region:rollup2
A. PURELY INDEPENDENT BOARD AND

02:13:19.091 --> 02:13:22.328 region:rollup2
FOR QUIT HAVE SOLDIERS DICTION

02:13:20.593 --> 02:13:23.696 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT WORSE TODAY WE HAVE A

02:13:22.328 --> 02:13:25.097 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHERE FOR DOES HAVE

02:13:23.696 --> 02:13:26.832 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT JURISDICTION OVER THE

02:13:25.097 --> 02:13:28.667 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AYE SO. BUT THE ISO

02:13:26.832 --> 02:13:30.336 region:rollup2
WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE TO THE

02:13:28.667 --> 02:13:31.136 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:13:30.336 --> 02:13:33.739 region:rollup2
ON I WANT TO.

02:13:31.136 --> 02:13:35.007 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH YOUR CONCERN

02:13:33.739 --> 02:13:35.374 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY SINCE I RAISE THAT I

02:13:35.007 --> 02:13:37.610 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH THAT.

02:13:35.374 --> 02:13:39.111 region:rollup2
.

02:13:37.610 --> 02:13:41.113 region:rollup2
THERE HAVE BEEN CASES FOR

02:13:39.111 --> 02:13:42.414 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THE STATE OF MINNESOTA

02:13:41.113 --> 02:13:43.682 region:rollup2
ENACTED A LAW THAT PROHIBITED

02:13:42.414 --> 02:13:44.984 region:rollup2
THE IMPORT OF COAL FIRED

02:13:43.682 --> 02:13:46.886 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY INTO THE STATE

02:13:44.984 --> 02:13:48.287 region:rollup2
MINNESOTA IS PART OF THE MIDWEST

02:13:46.886 --> 02:13:49.355 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR.

02:13:48.287 --> 02:13:50.623 region:rollup2
SOME COOPERATIVES IN NORTH

02:13:49.355 --> 02:13:52.825 region:rollup2
DAKOTA SUED THE STATE OF

02:13:50.623 --> 02:13:54.193 region:rollup2
MINNESOTA AND THEY GOT A THREE

02:13:52.825 --> 02:13:55.394 region:rollup2
OH NGUYEN IN THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

02:13:54.193 --> 02:13:56.829 region:rollup2
NAM AND THE JUDGES IN THE EIGHTH

02:13:55.394 --> 02:13:58.197 region:rollup2
CIRCUIT THAT RULED AGAINST THE

02:13:56.829 --> 02:13:59.632 region:rollup2
STATE.

02:13:58.197 --> 02:14:01.634 region:rollup2
WERE INFLUENCED BY THE FACT

02:13:59.632 --> 02:14:03.569 region:rollup2
THAT MINNESOTA WAS PART OF A

02:14:01.634 --> 02:14:04.703 region:rollup2
REGIONAL TRANSMISSION OPERATOR

02:14:03.569 --> 02:14:06.472 region:rollup2
AND THAT THEIR POLICIES

02:14:04.703 --> 02:14:08.340 region:rollup2
IMPERMISSIBLY INFRINGES UPON

02:14:06.472 --> 02:14:10.442 region:rollup2
FORK JURISDICTIONAL WHOLESALE

02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:12.945 region:rollup2
MARKET MECHANISMS AND RATES.

02:14:10.442 --> 02:14:15.514 region:rollup2
I THINK WE ARE VERY LIKELY TO

02:14:12.945 --> 02:14:18.217 region:rollup2
SEE SIMILAR CHALLENGES IN. A

02:14:15.514 --> 02:14:19.151 region:rollup2
WESTERN RTO I CAN'T TELL YOU

02:14:18.217 --> 02:14:20.686 region:rollup2
WHO'S GOING TO WIN AND WHO'S

02:14:19.151 --> 02:14:21.787 region:rollup2
GONNA LOSE THAT'S KIND OF A ROLL

02:14:20.686 --> 02:14:23.289 region:rollup2
OF THE DICE IN THE COURTS. ON

02:14:21.787 --> 02:14:24.890 region:rollup2
BUT WE WILL HAVE MORE INTERESTED

02:14:23.289 --> 02:14:26.892 region:rollup2
PLAYERS IN THE WEST

02:14:24.890 --> 02:14:28.527 region:rollup2
SPECIALLY COLERIDGE STATES

02:14:26.892 --> 02:14:30.095 region:rollup2
THAT ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

02:14:28.527 --> 02:14:31.997 region:rollup2
THE APPLICATION OF CALIFORNIA'S

02:14:30.095 --> 02:14:33.065 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS POLICIES.

02:14:31.997 --> 02:14:34.700 region:rollup2
IF IT TURNS OUT THAT ONE OF

02:14:33.065 --> 02:14:36.602 region:rollup2
THEIR COAL FIRED PLANTS WITH

02:14:34.700 --> 02:14:37.736 region:rollup2
TURNED ON DISTURB CALIFORNIA

02:14:36.602 --> 02:14:39.271 region:rollup2
UNBEKNOWN TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND

02:14:37.736 --> 02:14:40.472 region:rollup2
WE SEND THEM A BILL FOR THEIR

02:14:39.271 --> 02:14:42.841 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS COSTS.

02:14:40.472 --> 02:14:43.676 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THEIR REACTION LIKELY BE.

02:14:42.841 --> 02:14:44.944 region:rollup2
DOWN THERE ARE GEARING UP TO SUE

02:14:43.676 --> 02:14:47.546 region:rollup2
US

02:14:44.944 --> 02:14:49.181 region:rollup2
AND I ALSO SEE A SITUATION WHERE

02:14:47.546 --> 02:14:50.549 region:rollup2
THE CREATION OF AN RTO WAS GOING

02:14:49.181 --> 02:14:51.717 region:rollup2
TO REQUIRE A LOT OF FOLK

02:14:50.549 --> 02:14:52.184 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT INVOLVEMENT IN

02:14:51.717 --> 02:14:54.920 region:rollup2
APPROVAL OF TARIFFS.

02:14:52.184 --> 02:14:55.955 region:rollup2
LOOK.

02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:57.222 region:rollup2
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS

02:14:55.955 --> 02:14:58.624 region:rollup2
DECLARED WAR AND. ON A NUMBER OF

02:14:57.222 --> 02:15:00.859 region:rollup2
FRONTS

02:14:58.624 --> 02:15:02.561 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK WE I THINK IT

02:15:00.859 --> 02:15:04.296 region:rollup2
WOULD BE NAIVE TO ASSUME.

02:15:02.561 --> 02:15:05.864 region:rollup2
THAT IN THIS SITUATION

02:15:04.296 --> 02:15:07.800 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE A PASS ON

02:15:05.864 --> 02:15:09.268 region:rollup2
USING SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO

02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:10.936 region:rollup2
AFTER CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY

02:15:09.268 --> 02:15:12.438 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP.

02:15:10.936 --> 02:15:13.639 region:rollup2
IN FACT I IMAGINE ANY MEMBER OF

02:15:12.438 --> 02:15:14.907 region:rollup2

THEM WE ARE IN A BRAVE NEW WORLD

02:15:21.814 --> 02:15:24.350 region:rollup2
AND I THINK CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO

02:15:23.115 --> 02:15:26.418 region:rollup2
TAKE ALL MEASURES IT CAN'T

02:15:24.350 --> 02:15:29.054 region:rollup2
PROTECT ITSELF. AGAINST

02:15:26.418 --> 02:15:30.656 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNISTIC WEAPONIZATION OF

02:15:29.054 --> 02:15:32.191 region:rollup2

IN THE ECONOMY HAD WE HEARD FROM

THAT'S THE FEDERAL ENERGY

REGULATORY COMMISSION. AND ITS

02:16:38.323 --> 02:16:41.860 region:rollup2
GROUP OF I THINK FIVE

THIS TODAY.

02:17:07.319 --> 02:17:12.591 region:rollup2
I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING IS

02:17:09.721 --> 02:17:14.093 region:rollup2
TO BE AWARE OF MISTER FRIEDMAN'S

02:17:12.591 --> 02:17:15.561 region:rollup2
CONCERNS AND LOOK AT THEM

02:17:14.093 --> 02:17:17.596 region:rollup2
CAREFULLY.

02:17:15.561 --> 02:17:20.632 region:rollup2
I CERTAINLY MUCH RATHER JOINED A

02:17:17.596 --> 02:17:21.900 region:rollup2

WELL THANK YOU.

02:17:43.755 --> 02:17:46.625 region:rollup2
I HEARD IT MISS REYES ASKED ME

02:17:46.625 --> 02:17:49.895 region:rollup2
ALIGN MY REMARKS OF MISTER QUIRK

02:17:48.327 --> 02:17:51.530 region:rollup2
AND WAS ASKING CAN THINK ABOUT

02:17:49.895 --> 02:17:52.097 region:rollup2
THAT THE GUY JUST ARM WRESTLE

02:17:51.530 --> 02:17:53.198 region:rollup2
OFFER SOMETHIN EVERYTHING TO

02:17:52.097 --> 02:17:54.833 region:rollup2
SEE.

02:17:53.198 --> 02:17:55.801 region:rollup2
WHO WINS THEM YOU CERTAINLY

02:17:54.833 --> 02:17:57.469 region:rollup2
THERE'S A DIVERSITY OF OPINION

02:17:55.801 --> 02:17:58.170 region:rollup2
AS THERE SHOULD BE RIGHT AS

02:17:57.469 --> 02:17:59.938 region:rollup2
THERE SHOULD BE ONE WE'RE

02:17:58.170 --> 02:18:02.975 region:rollup2
LOOKING AN UNDERTAKING SOMETHING

02:17:59.938 --> 02:18:04.576 region:rollup2
THIS OF THIS MAGNITUDE?

02:18:02.975 --> 02:18:06.011 region:rollup2
WAS REYES ONE THINKS THIS

02:18:04.576 --> 02:18:07.846 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT IN IN A LINE OF SMALL

02:18:06.011 --> 02:18:08.080 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT I WAS ASKING BUT

02:18:07.846 --> 02:18:09.782 region:rollup2
EARLIER.

02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:10.582 region:rollup2
.

02:18:09.782 --> 02:18:11.250 region:rollup2
ARE THERE ARE THE RISKS THAT

02:18:10.582 --> 02:18:14.419 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES COULD THEN

02:18:11.250 --> 02:18:17.489 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIZE A DIRTY RESOURCES LIKE

02:18:14.419 --> 02:18:19.391 region:rollup2
COAL. NAM LOWERING THE COST TO

02:18:17.489 --> 02:18:21.793 region:rollup2
MAKE THEM MORE COMPETITIVE.

02:18:19.391 --> 02:18:23.262 region:rollup2
OLD HABITS ARE HARD TO BREAK

02:18:21.793 --> 02:18:24.863 region:rollup2
THAT WAS A QUESTION IT IS WOULD

02:18:23.262 --> 02:18:25.898 region:rollup2
THERE BE THAT POTENTIAL OF OTHER

02:18:24.863 --> 02:18:28.400 region:rollup2
STATES SUBSIDIZING IN ORDER TO

02:18:25.898 --> 02:18:32.070 region:rollup2
REDUCE COSTS.

02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:33.939 region:rollup2
MY TAKE A CRACK AT THIS M. SO.

02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:36.241 region:rollup2
I THINK THE STATES HAVE ALL THE

02:18:33.939 --> 02:18:38.110 region:rollup2
TOOLS THEY WOULD NORMALLY HAVE.

02:18:36.241 --> 02:18:39.845 region:rollup2
LAND USE POLICY ENVIRONMENTAL

02:18:38.110 --> 02:18:41.513 region:rollup2
POLICY TAX POLICY PROPERTY TAX

02:18:39.845 --> 02:18:43.248 region:rollup2
POLICY.

02:18:41.513 --> 02:18:46.018 region:rollup2
TO FURTHER THE ECONOMIC

02:18:43.248 --> 02:18:48.353 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT THAT THEY WANT.

02:18:46.018 --> 02:18:49.822 region:rollup2
AND SO IS THAT A RISK.

02:18:48.353 --> 02:18:50.989 region:rollup2
I THINK IT PROBABLY IS AND

02:18:49.822 --> 02:18:52.558 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME

02:18:50.989 --> 02:18:53.892 region:rollup2
STATES AND THAT'S A HANDFUL

02:18:52.558 --> 02:18:55.661 region:rollup2
WHERE COLE IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT

02:18:53.892 --> 02:18:57.162 region:rollup2
PART OF THEIR.

02:18:55.661 --> 02:18:58.897 region:rollup2
I WILL ALSO SAY AND I'M NOT AN

02:18:57.162 --> 02:18:59.398 region:rollup2
EXPERT ON COAL DEVELOPMENT BUT

02:18:58.897 --> 02:19:01.066 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE PUBLIC POWER

02:18:59.398 --> 02:19:03.769 region:rollup2
ENTITIES IN THE WEST ARE HEAVILY

02:19:01.066 --> 02:19:05.470 region:rollup2
HEAVILY.

02:19:03.769 --> 02:19:07.606 region:rollup2
AND THEY SEE IT AS DYING IF NOT

02:19:05.470 --> 02:19:08.774 region:rollup2
ALMOST AT.

02:19:07.606 --> 02:19:10.042 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

02:19:08.774 --> 02:19:11.476 region:rollup2
YOUR LOT OF THE COAL PLANTS ARE

02:19:10.042 --> 02:19:12.945 region:rollup2
COMING OFF CONTRACTS IN THE MID

02:19:11.476 --> 02:19:14.279 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSANDS.

02:19:12.945 --> 02:19:14.846 region:rollup2
AND YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A

02:19:14.279 --> 02:19:15.814 region:rollup2
FEW MILLION DOLLARS HERE AND

02:19:14.846 --> 02:19:17.115 region:rollup2
THERE.

02:19:15.814 --> 02:19:19.384 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT JUST THE PLANTS

02:19:17.115 --> 02:19:20.686 region:rollup2
IT'S THE MARKETS.

02:19:19.384 --> 02:19:22.588 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TENS AND

02:19:20.686 --> 02:19:26.024 region:rollup2
TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

02:19:22.588 --> 02:19:28.827 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT. IN THE CONTEXT OF.

02:19:26.024 --> 02:19:31.463 region:rollup2
OF KEEPING THESE RESOURCES IN

02:19:28.827 --> 02:19:32.764 region:rollup2
INVESTING IN THEM TO BE READY

02:19:31.463 --> 02:19:33.465 region:rollup2
DECADES LATER INTO THE FUTURE SO

02:19:32.764 --> 02:19:35.868 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL.

02:19:33.465 --> 02:19:37.569 region:rollup2
NO.

02:19:35.868 --> 02:19:38.971 region:rollup2
ARE THEY LOOKING AT INVESTING

02:19:37.569 --> 02:19:40.572 region:rollup2
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THESE

02:19:38.971 --> 02:19:42.507 region:rollup2
PLANTS TO KEEP THEM ALIVE NET.

02:19:40.572 --> 02:19:43.709 region:rollup2
SO I AM.

02:19:42.507 --> 02:19:44.643 region:rollup2
IT'S AN IMPORTANT ACTUALLY

02:19:43.709 --> 02:19:45.577 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THING ONE OF THE MANY

02:19:44.643 --> 02:19:47.746 region:rollup2
VARIABLES

WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE HAS

02:30:19.911 --> 02:30:21.746 region:rollup2
BEEN.

02:30:20.945 --> 02:30:23.414 region:rollup2
SOME VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS

02:30:21.746 --> 02:30:24.249 region:rollup2
RAISED WE BELIEVE THEY NEED TO

02:30:23.414 --> 02:30:26.217 region:rollup2
BE ADDRESSED SERIOUSLY BUT WE

02:30:24.249 --> 02:30:27.752 region:rollup2
DON'T FORGET THE CONTEXT.

02:30:26.217 --> 02:30:30.088 region:rollup2
IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT A

02:30:27.752 --> 02:30:31.556 region:rollup2
REGIONAL ROBUST MARKET A FOR NEW

02:30:30.088 --> 02:30:33.124 region:rollup2

TIME TO SEND THE POWER WHERE IT

02:30:33.124 --> 02:30:36.094 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO GO WHEN IT'S BEEN

02:30:33.691 --> 02:30:37.662 region:rollup2
PRODUCED. IS ESSENTIAL UP FROM

EATING OUR CHEMICALS AS A

02:30:37.662 --> 02:30:40.865 region:rollup2
BASELINE HE'S BEEN STRUCTURE WE

02:30:39.264 --> 02:30:42.634 region:rollup2
THINK THE COST OF INACTION IS

02:30:40.865 --> 02:30:43.701 region:rollup2
HIGHER EMISSIONS HIGHER COSTS TO

02:30:42.634 --> 02:30:44.869 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS AND FEWER

02:30:43.701 --> 02:30:46.938 region:rollup2

TRANSPARENT WAY. WE THINK THAT

02:31:04.322 --> 02:31:08.593 region:rollup2
REGIONALIZATION IS AN IMPORTANT

02:31:06.291 --> 02:31:10.528 region:rollup2
PRIORITY FOR THE STATE AND WE

02:31:08.593 --> 02:31:11.863 region:rollup2

02:31:10.528 --> 02:31:13.665 region:rollup2
SOON AS POSSIBLE.

02:31:11.863 --> 02:31:15.266 region:rollup2
REGIONALIZATION IS ONE WAY TO

MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THAT.

02:31:19.237 --> 02:31:23.575 region:rollup2
WE DO NEED TO KEEP IN MIND LOCAL

02:31:21.139 --> 02:31:25.076 region:rollup2
AIR QUALITY AND WE DON'T THINK

02:31:23.575 --> 02:31:26.911 region:rollup2
REGIONALIZATION WILL MAKE THAT

02:31:25.076 --> 02:31:27.912 region:rollup2
WORSE HOWEVER THAT'S.

02:31:26.911 --> 02:31:29.714 region:rollup2
NOT SHOULDN'T BE THE ONLY

02:31:27.912 --> 02:31:31.282 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION WE CAN ALSO LOOK

02:31:29.714 --> 02:31:32.550 region:rollup2
AT WAYS TO IMPROVE LOCAL AIR

02:31:31.282 --> 02:31:36.454 region:rollup2

I THINK MOST FOLKS NO ONE HERE

02:32:39.951 --> 02:32:42.453 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS AN EFFORT THAT HAS

02:32:41.519 --> 02:32:44.055 region:rollup2

02:32:42.453 --> 02:32:46.424 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS.

02:32:44.055 --> 02:32:47.258 region:rollup2
I BEHIND CLOSED DOORS WITHOUT

LEGISLATOR IN PLAN I THINK IT'S

02:32:47.258 --> 02:32:49.660 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

02:32:49.660 --> 02:32:53.898 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ISSUE. I ALSO WANT TO

NOTE THAT IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS

02:32:53.898 --> 02:32:56.734 region:rollup2

02:32:56.734 --> 02:32:59.270 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT

02:32:58.002 --> 02:33:00.471 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY WERE READY TO SIGN

02:32:59.270 --> 02:33:01.806 region:rollup2
THOSE DEALS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

02:33:00.471 --> 02:33:03.408 region:rollup2
AND I DO HOPE THAT THEY HAVE THE

02:33:01.806 --> 02:33:04.909 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION NOW. THAT THIS IS

02:33:03.408 --> 02:33:06.310 region:rollup2
BEING DELIGHTED.

02:33:14.052 --> 02:33:16.654 region:rollup2
THE SAME STUDY THAT I BELIEVE HE

02:33:15.620 --> 02:33:18.122 region:rollup2
WAS REFERENCING WHICH IS THE

02:33:16.654 --> 02:33:20.024 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HIGHEST SO S. B.

I HAVE A CHART HERE SHOULD

ANYONE LOOK AT IT. ACTUALLY

02:33:22.427 --> 02:33:25.563 region:rollup2
SHOWS THAT IF WE CONDUCT

BUSINESS AS USUAL AND DO NOT. DO

02:33:25.563 --> 02:33:28.199 region:rollup2
NOT ENGAGING REGIONALIZATION

02:33:26.764 --> 02:33:29.300 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION THE BY TWENTY THIRTY

02:33:28.199 --> 02:33:31.235 region:rollup2
THIS CAN BE NINETY THOUSAND NEW

02:33:29.300 --> 02:33:32.470 region:rollup2
JOBS CREATED. IF WE DO CONSIDER

02:33:31.235 --> 02:33:33.938 region:rollup2
REGIONALIZATION THERE WILL BE A

02:33:32.470 --> 02:33:35.673 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND NEW

02:33:33.938 --> 02:33:37.241 region:rollup2

TRAINED WORKFORCE.

02:33:39.610 --> 02:33:41.512 region:rollup2
IF WE WERE TO CONTINUE IN A

02:33:40.912 --> 02:33:42.780 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT MODEL OF

02:33:41.512 --> 02:33:44.048 region:rollup2
REGIONALIZATION THERE'S GOING TO

02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:45.349 region:rollup2
BE ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS

02:33:44.048 --> 02:33:46.517 region:rollup2
CREATED SO I LOOK FORWARD TO

02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:47.819 region:rollup2
HAVING THAT DISCUSSION AS WE GO

02:33:46.517 --> 02:33:49.754 region:rollup2

THIS IS THE CHART. WE WANNA SEE

02:34:04.302 --> 02:34:06.804 region:rollup2
MORE RENEWABLES IN CALIFORNIA

02:34:05.837 --> 02:34:08.206 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE THE CROSS THE

02:34:06.804 --> 02:34:10.575 region:rollup2
COUNTRY BUT CALIFORNIA IS THE

02:34:08.206 --> 02:34:12.443 region:rollup2
LEADER. WE HAVE TO FACE THAT.

02:34:10.575 --> 02:34:13.978 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS POLICY

02:34:12.443 --> 02:34:15.079 region:rollup2
REGIONALLY CAUSATION NOT ONLY

02:34:13.978 --> 02:34:16.614 region:rollup2
WILL HELP US TO INTEGRATE

02:34:15.079 --> 02:34:19.550 region:rollup2
RENEWABLES IT WILL HELP US TO

02:34:16.614 --> 02:34:20.051 region:rollup2
EXPORT OUR RENEWABLE POLICIES TO

02:34:19.550 --> 02:34:21.219 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES.

02:34:20.051 --> 02:34:22.720 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS PURELY THROUGH THE

02:34:21.219 --> 02:34:25.056 region:rollup2
FUNCTION OF THE MARKET.

02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:26.791 region:rollup2
A IT ALSO IT'LL HELP LOWER

GREENHOUSE GASES IN THE LONG

02:34:26.791 --> 02:34:31.095 region:rollup2
TERM WE AGREE WITH AN RTC AND

02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:32.897 region:rollup2
OTHERS THAT AIR QUALITY SHOULD

02:34:31.095 --> 02:34:33.931 region:rollup2
BE LOOKED AT THIS IS NOT A

02:34:32.897 --> 02:34:35.199 region:rollup2
SURPRISE TO ANY OF US IN

02:34:33.931 --> 02:34:36.834 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:34:35.199 --> 02:34:37.935 region:rollup2
THERE ARE DISADVANTAGED

02:34:36.834 --> 02:34:39.337 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT HIGH WORST AIR

02:34:37.935 --> 02:34:40.805 region:rollup2
QUALITY THAN OTHER PLACES WE

02:34:39.337 --> 02:34:41.706 region:rollup2
WANT THERE TO BE SOLUTIONS TO

02:34:40.805 --> 02:34:44.709 region:rollup2

KNOW IS THAT.

02:35:18.142 --> 02:35:21.212 region:rollup2
.

02:35:19.210 --> 02:35:23.815 region:rollup2
I.

02:35:21.212 --> 02:35:25.883 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS AND WILL BE THE

02:35:23.815 --> 02:35:27.018 region:rollup2
ONE TO DO ITS OWN PROCUREMENT IT

02:35:25.883 --> 02:35:29.787 region:rollup2
IS THE WANT TO CHOOSE THE

02:35:27.018 --> 02:35:31.923 region:rollup2
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD.

02:35:29.787 --> 02:35:34.091 region:rollup2
RESOURCES IT IS THE WIND TO BE

02:35:31.923 --> 02:35:35.593 region:rollup2
ABLE TO ENFORCE ITS GREENHOUSE

02:35:34.091 --> 02:35:37.094 region:rollup2
GAS POLICIES THROUGH THE MARKET.

02:35:35.593 --> 02:35:38.429 region:rollup2
THESE THINGS DON'T CHANGE OR GO

02:35:37.094 --> 02:35:40.264 region:rollup2
AWAY AND JUST IN CASE WE WERE

02:35:38.429 --> 02:35:41.465 region:rollup2
WORRIED THAT THEY DO THEY ARE IN

02:35:40.264 --> 02:35:43.067 region:rollup2
THE BILL.

02:35:41.465 --> 02:35:44.936 region:rollup2
THIS IS ALREADY PROTECTED THE

02:35:43.067 --> 02:35:46.704 region:rollup2
WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN AND I

02:35:44.936 --> 02:35:49.073 region:rollup2
THINK OF COURSE THE BILL COULD

02:35:46.704 --> 02:35:50.308 region:rollup2
BE IMPROVED NO OFFENSE AUTHORITY

02:35:49.073 --> 02:35:58.883 region:rollup2
STEVE BUT IT IS THERE IN

02:35:50.308 --> 02:35:59.851 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE. SO THANK THANK.

02:35:58.883 --> 02:36:01.786 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOHN

02:35:59.851 --> 02:36:03.254 region:rollup2
WHITE REPRESENTED CLEAN PARKING

02:36:01.786 --> 02:36:04.322 region:rollup2
PAIN I WANT TO ECHO THE

02:36:03.254 --> 02:36:06.824 region:rollup2
SENTIMENTS ABOUT OUR HEALTH

02:36:04.322 --> 02:36:07.792 region:rollup2
REFRESHING THE PROCESS OF THAT

02:36:06.824 --> 02:36:08.559 region:rollup2
YOU'VE EMBARKED ON AND THE FACT

02:36:07.792 --> 02:36:09.393 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE HAVING THESE

02:36:08.559 --> 02:36:12.029 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS AND MARCH INSTEAD

02:36:09.393 --> 02:36:13.497 region:rollup2
OF IN AUGUST. IS A GOOD SIGN

02:36:12.029 --> 02:36:16.734 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET SOME

02:36:13.497 --> 02:36:18.302 region:rollup2
WORK DONE OF OUR JUSTICE THE AYE

02:36:16.734 --> 02:36:21.038 region:rollup2
SO SAID THAT THE REGIONAL

02:36:18.302 --> 02:36:21.372 region:rollup2
EXPANSION IS NOT THE SOLE

02:36:21.038 --> 02:36:22.373 region:rollup2
SOLUTION TO.

02:36:21.372 --> 02:36:23.641 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE

02:36:22.373 --> 02:36:25.142 region:rollup2
CREATED IN OUR SUBSTANTIAL

02:36:23.641 --> 02:36:26.944 region:rollup2
SUCCESS.

02:36:25.142 --> 02:36:29.680 region:rollup2
NEITHER SHOULD WE THINK OF THE

02:36:26.944 --> 02:36:31.749 region:rollup2
RENEWAL AS THE. REGIONAL GRID AS

02:36:29.680 --> 02:36:33.417 region:rollup2
THE SOLUTION FOR ALL OF THE

02:36:31.749 --> 02:36:34.452 region:rollup2
OTHER PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE.

02:36:33.417 --> 02:36:36.087 region:rollup2
NATURAL GAS POWER PLANT

02:36:34.452 --> 02:36:38.222 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS ARE GOING UP.

02:36:36.087 --> 02:36:39.757 region:rollup2
TODAY WITHOUT REGIONALIZATION

02:36:38.222 --> 02:36:40.291 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE GRIDS

02:36:39.757 --> 02:36:42.493 region:rollup2
OPERATING BECAUSE WE GOT

02:36:40.291 --> 02:36:43.961 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS THAT

02:36:42.493 --> 02:36:45.529 region:rollup2
WE HAD TO TURN BACK ON WHEN THE

02:36:43.961 --> 02:36:46.330 region:rollup2
SUN GOES DOWN SO THAT'S A

02:36:45.529 --> 02:36:48.199 region:rollup2
PROBLEM TODAY.

02:36:46.330 --> 02:36:50.401 region:rollup2
A AND I THINK IT NEEDS ATTENTION

02:36:48.199 --> 02:36:52.837 region:rollup2
TODAY SEPARATE FROM THIS BILL OR

02:36:50.401 --> 02:36:54.672 region:rollup2
MAYBE AS POSTCARDS SECOND IS

02:36:52.837 --> 02:36:56.574 region:rollup2
MISTER WHICH SAID THE THAT THE

02:36:54.672 --> 02:36:57.642 region:rollup2
STAKES ON PROCUREMENT.

02:36:56.574 --> 02:36:59.176 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF JOBS ISN'T A VERY

02:36:57.642 --> 02:37:01.045 region:rollup2
BIG CONCERN BUT I WOULD POINT

02:36:59.176 --> 02:37:02.413 region:rollup2
OUT THAT AT THE MOMENT.

02:37:01.045 --> 02:37:03.848 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT DOING ANY PROCUREMENT

02:37:02.413 --> 02:37:05.816 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA UTILITIES BY

02:37:03.848 --> 02:37:07.618 region:rollup2
ANYTHING CCA'S ARE JUST GETTING

02:37:05.816 --> 02:37:09.086 region:rollup2
STARTED.

02:37:07.618 --> 02:37:09.954 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOT BUILDING WHERE WE'RE

02:37:09.086 --> 02:37:11.289 region:rollup2
BUILDING OUT WHAT WE'VE ALREADY

02:37:09.954 --> 02:37:13.824 region:rollup2
BOUGHT.

02:37:11.289 --> 02:37:14.792 region:rollup2
SO TO ME THINKING ABOUT HOW TO

02:37:13.824 --> 02:37:16.994 region:rollup2
GET MORE CHIU THERMAL MORE LARGE

02:37:14.792 --> 02:37:17.862 region:rollup2
SCALE STORAGE.

02:37:16.994 --> 02:37:18.963 region:rollup2
OF MORE CLEAN PILE LAST THOSE

02:37:17.862 --> 02:37:20.698 region:rollup2
ARE THINGS THAT AREN'T

02:37:18.963 --> 02:37:22.500 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY THE RESPONSIBILITY

02:37:20.698 --> 02:37:24.135 region:rollup2
OF THE REGIONAL CURRENT.

02:37:22.500 --> 02:37:25.369 region:rollup2
POLLS ON THERE THAT'S OTHER WORK

02:37:24.135 --> 02:37:26.871 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO DO.

02:37:25.369 --> 02:37:28.639 region:rollup2
K. BECAUSE PROCUREMENT IS OUR

02:37:26.871 --> 02:37:30.374 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY.

02:37:28.639 --> 02:37:33.611 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

02:37:30.374 --> 02:37:34.345 region:rollup2
TO STRENGTHEN OUR PROTECTION VIS

02:37:33.611 --> 02:37:36.681 region:rollup2
A VIS THE FEDS

02:37:34.345 --> 02:37:38.249 region:rollup2
BY ALIGNING WITH THE WEST COAST

02:37:36.681 --> 02:37:40.151 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR INSLEY GOVERNOR BROWN

02:37:38.249 --> 02:37:41.852 region:rollup2
IN OREGON. A GOVERNOR SANDOVAL

02:37:40.151 --> 02:37:43.421 region:rollup2
IN NEVADA ARE MUCH CLOSER TO OUR

02:37:41.852 --> 02:37:45.289 region:rollup2
POINT OF VIEW ON ALL THESE

02:37:43.421 --> 02:37:47.591 region:rollup2
MATTERS.

02:37:45.289 --> 02:37:48.626 region:rollup2
THEN OUR OF THE TRUMP PEOPLE AND

02:37:47.591 --> 02:37:49.961 region:rollup2
I THINK THE WAY THE BILL IS

02:37:48.626 --> 02:37:51.796 region:rollup2
WRITTEN.

02:37:49.961 --> 02:37:53.965 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF REQUIRING REPORTING

02:37:51.796 --> 02:37:55.866 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

02:37:53.965 --> 02:37:57.568 region:rollup2
ACQUIRING CERTAIN CRITERIA TO BE

02:37:55.866 --> 02:37:59.804 region:rollup2
MET FOR ANYBODY TO JOIN IS GONNA

02:37:57.568 --> 02:38:01.205 region:rollup2
MAKE IT PROBABLY LESS LIKELY

02:37:59.804 --> 02:38:03.407 region:rollup2
THAT UTAH WYOMING ARE GOING TO

02:38:01.205 --> 02:38:04.909 region:rollup2
COME IN. RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE OF

02:38:03.407 --> 02:38:06.577 region:rollup2
THE WAY WE'RE FRAMING THIS I

02:38:04.909 --> 02:38:07.745 region:rollup2
THINK SO I THINK.

02:38:06.577 --> 02:38:10.014 region:rollup2
PART OF WHAT'S GOING ON IS WE

02:38:07.745 --> 02:38:12.249 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT CHASING GHOSTS FROM

02:38:10.014 --> 02:38:13.451 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS. DISCUSSIONS WERE

02:38:12.249 --> 02:38:14.051 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WORRY THAT THEY'RE GONNA

02:38:13.451 --> 02:38:14.852 region:rollup2
GET JAMMED AT THE END SESSION

02:38:14.051 --> 02:38:16.587 region:rollup2
AND.

02:38:14.852 --> 02:38:18.222 region:rollup2
WORST CASE SCENARIO I THINK WHAT

02:38:16.587 --> 02:38:18.856 region:rollup2
WE HAVE NOW IS OPPORTUNITY TO

02:38:18.222 --> 02:38:20.558 region:rollup2
FACE THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEFORE

02:38:18.856 --> 02:38:22.126 region:rollup2
US.

02:38:20.558 --> 02:38:23.327 region:rollup2
COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS SOME IN

02:38:22.126 --> 02:38:25.162 region:rollup2
THIS BILL BUT SOME IN OTHER

02:38:23.327 --> 02:38:26.797 region:rollup2
BILLS.

02:38:25.162 --> 02:38:27.998 region:rollup2
BECAUSE GRANT WE HAVE MUCH WORK

02:38:26.797 --> 02:38:29.400 region:rollup2
TO DO IF WE'RE GOING TO STAY ON

02:38:27.998 --> 02:38:30.968 region:rollup2
TRACK IF WE'RE GOING TO LOWER

02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:32.703 region:rollup2
COSTS AND IF WE'RE GONNA TO

02:38:30.968 --> 02:38:33.304 region:rollup2
CREATE THIS THE LOW CARB GRITTED
