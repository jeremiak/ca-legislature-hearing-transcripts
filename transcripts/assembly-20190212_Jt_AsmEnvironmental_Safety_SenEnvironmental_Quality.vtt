00:21:27.285 --> 00:21:30.389
SHARING THIS WITH ME IS AN A R.

00:21:30.455 --> 00:21:32.157
DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS AT THE MOMENT

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:33.659
WE'RE NOT SURE HOW LONG THAT'S

00:21:33.725 --> 00:21:35.127
LASTING.

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:37.429
HOWEVER --

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:38.830
WE WILL HAVE --

00:21:38.897 --> 00:21:40.332
STAFF MEMBERS HERE.

00:21:40.399 --> 00:21:42.534
AND I THINK IT'S BEST THAT WE

00:21:42.601 --> 00:21:45.570
JUST START AND RECOGNIZE THAT

00:21:45.637 --> 00:21:48.540
PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME HERE --

00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:50.642
TO BOTH LISTEN AND PRESENT.

00:21:50.709 --> 00:21:52.411
SO GOOD AFTERNOON I'D LIKE TO

HEARING IN THE ASSEMBLY

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.682
ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC

00:21:56.748 --> 00:21:58.350
MATERIALS COMMITTEE.

00:21:58.417 --> 00:21:59.584
AND THE SENATE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:03.588
QUALITY COMMITTEE --

00:22:03.655 --> 00:22:05.190
I'M BILL QUIRK CHAIR OF THE

00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:07.793
ASSEMBLY ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE --

00:22:07.859 --> 00:22:09.861
TODAY WILL DISCUSS THE STATE'S

00:22:09.928 --> 00:22:12.230
EFFORT AND PROTECTING PEOPLE AND

00:22:12.297 --> 00:22:13.465
THE ENVIRONMENT FROM TOXIC

00:22:13.532 --> 00:22:14.900
MATERIALS.

00:22:14.966 --> 00:22:16.768
IN PRODUCTS THROUGH IMPLEMENTING

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:18.503
A REPROCESSED GREEN CHEMISTRY

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:20.238
PROGRAM.

00:22:20.305 --> 00:22:21.773
EACH YEAR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.442
CHEMICALS ARE MANUFACTURED IN --

00:22:23.508 --> 00:22:26.645
IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES.

00:22:26.712 --> 00:22:28.046
AS WE ALL KNOW CHEMICAL PRODUCTS

00:22:28.113 --> 00:22:29.648
CAN HAVE IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS

00:22:29.715 --> 00:22:32.951
THAT IMPROVE OUR EVERYDAY LIVES.

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:36.154
HOWEVER WE DON'T KNOW MUCH WHAT

00:22:36.221 --> 00:22:38.590
WE HOWEVER WHAT WE DON'T KNOW

00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:39.858
MUCH ABOUT IS HOW THESE

00:22:39.925 --> 00:22:41.359
SUBSTANCES.

00:22:41.426 --> 00:22:42.594
CAN EFFECT --

00:22:42.661 --> 00:22:48.133
YOU MEN AN ECO SYSTEM HEALTH.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.001
THIS BRINGS JUST GREEN CHEMISTRY

00:22:50.068 --> 00:22:51.770
GREEN CHEMISTRY IS A DIFFERENT

00:22:51.837 --> 00:22:53.872
APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND

00:22:53.939 --> 00:22:56.274
PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTION

00:22:56.341 --> 00:22:56.575
[inaudible]

00:22:56.641 --> 00:22:59.811
AND IT'S YOU KNOW IN THERE WAS A

00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:01.012
TIME [inaudible]

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:03.782
WHEN -- THE

00:23:03.849 --> 00:23:05.383
ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE MIGHT

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:09.154
VOTE ON BANNING THE CHEMICAL OR

00:23:09.221 --> 00:23:10.288
STANDING IN ANY --

00:23:10.355 --> 00:23:11.623
SUBSTANCE IN WHICH THERE'S A

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.291
TRACE OF THE CHEMICAL.

00:23:13.358 --> 00:23:15.360
IT'S MUCH BETTER IN FACT TO DO

00:23:15.427 --> 00:23:17.095
TWO THINGS ONE IS TO USE THE

00:23:17.162 --> 00:23:18.430
BEST SCIENCE.

00:23:18.497 --> 00:23:20.999
AND THE OTHER IS TO LOOK AT IF

00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:22.634
YOU WERE TO BAN THAT CHEMICAL

00:23:22.701 --> 00:23:24.603
AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND ARE

00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:26.204
THEIR SUBSTITUTES THAT ARE

00:23:26.271 --> 00:23:28.640
ACTUALLY SAFER --

00:23:28.707 --> 00:23:30.709
IS THIS --

00:23:30.776 --> 00:23:33.879
OR IT CAN WE DO WITHOUT THIS.

00:23:33.945 --> 00:23:36.181
CHEMICAL OR ANY SUBSTITUTE FOR

00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:37.415
IT ALL TOGETHER OR IS THERE IS A

00:23:37.482 --> 00:23:38.784
SUBSTITUTE AND THAT'S THE

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:39.918
DIFFERENCE.

00:23:39.985 --> 00:23:41.419
IN MY MIND AND WHAT GREEN

00:23:41.486 --> 00:23:43.155
CHEMISTRY DOES.

00:23:43.221 --> 00:23:45.390
SO IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE

00:23:45.457 --> 00:23:47.259
LEGISLATURE LEGISLATURE ENACTED

00:23:47.325 --> 00:23:50.395

00:23:52.063 --> 00:23:54.032
ESTABLISH A GREEN CHEMISTRY

00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:55.700
PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA.

00:23:55.767 --> 00:23:59.504

THIS BILL WAS PAID A

00:24:10.816 --> 00:24:12.184
COMPREHENSIVE.

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:13.385
SCIENCE BASED AND DELIBERATE

00:24:13.451 --> 00:24:16.321
APPROACH TO CHEMICALS POLICY. TO

00:24:16.388 --> 00:24:18.690
PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC

00:24:18.757 --> 00:24:20.225
SUBSTANCE CONTROLLER.

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:23.195
WITH CLEAR AUTHORITY TO REGULATE

00:24:23.261 --> 00:24:25.163
HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS IN ALL

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:29.100
PRODUCTS WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS.

00:24:29.167 --> 00:24:30.435
I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT WHEN THE

00:24:30.502 --> 00:24:32.070
LEGISLATURE APPROVED AGAIN GREEN

00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:33.572
CHEMISTRY BELLS WAS NO FISCAL

00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:35.674
ANALYSIS COMPLETED FOR EITHER

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:36.441
VEIL.

00:24:36.508 --> 00:24:37.809
MAKING THE FUTURE COSTS OF

00:24:37.876 --> 00:24:40.745
IMPLEMENTATION ON CERTAIN.

00:24:40.812 --> 00:24:42.414
IN FACT WERE NOT SURE TODAY THAT

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.882
WE HAVE FUNDED THIS AT THE RIGHT

00:24:43.949 --> 00:24:45.784
LEVEL --

00:24:45.851 --> 00:24:48.053
GIVEN THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:24:48.119 --> 00:24:51.089
TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND CONTROL.

00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:53.925
IS FACING FISCAL CHALLENGES WE

00:24:53.992 --> 00:24:55.293
WILL BE DISCUSSING THEIR BUDGET.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.127
AND A JOINT HEARING LATER THIS

00:24:56.194 --> 00:24:59.231

TWO DAYS TO ASSESS WHETHER THE

00:25:01.233 --> 00:25:02.834
GAME CHEMISTRY PROGRAM HAS

00:25:02.901 --> 00:25:04.703
ACCOMPLISHED THE INTENT OF THE

00:25:04.769 --> 00:25:06.538
LEGISLATURE OF THE LAST TEN AND

00:25:06.605 --> 00:25:07.672
A HALF YEARS.

00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:09.608
AND DETERMINE HOW WE CAN INSURE

00:25:09.674 --> 00:25:11.109
ITS GREATEST SUCCESS IN THE

00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:14.913
FUTURE -- SO

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.481
I WOULD LIKE --

00:25:16.548 --> 00:25:18.316

JOINTLY SO WE CAN START WITH THE

00:25:53.952 --> 00:25:56.454
SAME SET OF FACTS --

00:25:56.521 --> 00:25:58.490
AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE

00:25:58.556 --> 00:26:00.692

00:26:05.931 --> 00:26:07.265
SO.

00:26:07.332 --> 00:26:09.601
I SELL IT NOW CENTER BAD THAT

00:26:09.668 --> 00:26:11.469
ALLEN IS HERE HE'S GOTTEN OUT OF

00:26:11.536 --> 00:26:12.671

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:21.112
SO AS A SAID WE CAN OPERATE FROM

00:26:21.179 --> 00:26:22.614
THE SAME SET OF FACTS.

00:26:22.681 --> 00:26:24.516
IT'S MY HOPE.

00:26:24.582 --> 00:26:27.118
THAT IF THERE'S A BILL PASSED IN

00:26:27.185 --> 00:26:29.020
SENATE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OR

00:26:29.087 --> 00:26:31.890
AN ASSEMBLY --

00:26:31.957 --> 00:26:32.991
ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC

00:26:33.058 --> 00:26:33.692
MATERIALS.

00:26:33.758 --> 00:26:35.427
THAT.

00:26:35.493 --> 00:26:37.028
WHEN IT REACHES THE OTHER

00:26:37.095 --> 00:26:39.564
COMMITTEE THAT WILL BE BECAUSE

00:26:39.631 --> 00:26:41.099
WE WORK FROM THE SAME SET OF

00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:43.068
FACTS AND VALUES?

00:26:43.134 --> 00:26:44.736
THAT IN FACT --

00:26:44.803 --> 00:26:47.138
THE AUTHORS OF WHAT PASSED IN

00:26:47.205 --> 00:26:48.640
ONE HOUSE WILL NOT HAVE TO SEE

00:26:48.707 --> 00:26:50.942
RADICAL CHANGES IN THE NEXT ONE

00:26:51.009 --> 00:26:51.776
THAT'S OUR HOPE.

00:26:51.843 --> 00:26:53.745
DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN BUT THAT'S

00:26:53.812 --> 00:26:55.313
MY HOPE --

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.383
SO SENATOR ALLEN WOULD YOU LIKE.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.318
TO SIT MAKE A FEW OPENING

00:27:00.385 --> 00:27:02.287
REMARKS THANK YOU CHAIRED QUIRK

00:27:02.354 --> 00:27:03.488
AND I DO APPRECIATE YOUR

00:27:03.555 --> 00:27:06.791
PATIENCE WE WERE.

00:27:06.858 --> 00:27:07.359
THE THE CAUCUS IS STILL IN A

00:27:07.425 --> 00:27:07.926
DEEP.

00:27:07.993 --> 00:27:08.660
DISCUSSION ABOUT ANOTHER

00:27:08.727 --> 00:27:11.830
IMPORTANT TOPIC OF P. JEANNIE

00:27:11.896 --> 00:27:14.165
PATADA -- AN

00:27:14.232 --> 00:27:15.066
ISSUE I'M SURE YOU'VE SPENT SOME

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:15.967
TIME THINKING ABOUT BUT I DO

00:27:16.034 --> 00:27:16.534
APPRECIATE YOU GREAT DEAL I

00:27:16.601 --> 00:27:17.135
APPRECIATE THE MEETING THAT WE

00:27:17.202 --> 00:27:17.736
HAD NOT TOO LONG AGO TALKING

00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:18.670
ABOUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES.

00:27:18.737 --> 00:27:19.704
AND I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT

00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:21.072
THAT WILL BE CORNY TOGETHER.

00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:26.011
ARE AND ON THE ISSUE OF OF YOU

00:27:26.077 --> 00:27:27.979
KNOW YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE

00:27:28.046 --> 00:27:28.580
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF THIS

00:27:28.646 --> 00:27:29.481
ISSUE.

00:27:29.547 --> 00:27:30.749
AND THE LEADERSHIP OF PREVIOUS

00:27:30.815 --> 00:27:33.051
MEMBERS WHO HAVE WHO REALLY

00:27:33.118 --> 00:27:34.853
UNDERSTOOD THE FACT THAT --

00:27:34.919 --> 00:27:35.854
THAT THAT --

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.655
THAT IF CALIFORNIANS YOU KNOW

00:27:37.722 --> 00:27:38.823
WANT TO MAINTAIN THEIR STANDARD

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:39.991
OF LIVING THEY THEY THEY THEY

00:27:40.058 --> 00:27:40.592
CERTAINLY WANT TO HAVE THEIR

00:27:40.658 --> 00:27:42.027
SANTA LIVING IMPROVED BY MODERN

00:27:42.093 --> 00:27:42.894
CHEMISTRY.

00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:44.396
BUT WITHOUT EXPOSURE TO

00:27:44.462 --> 00:27:46.331
DANGEROUS.

00:27:46.398 --> 00:27:47.432
HI DANGEROUS CHEMICALS.

00:27:47.499 --> 00:27:49.868
AND SO WHEN THIS IS HOW WE WE

00:27:49.934 --> 00:27:51.269
GREW THIS CONCEPT OF GREEN

00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:52.303
CHEMISTRY IN.

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:54.072
AND THIS IS A AN IDEA WHEREBY WE

00:27:54.139 --> 00:27:55.340
LOOK AT THE GOODS THAT PEOPLE

00:27:55.407 --> 00:27:56.775
USE EVERY DAY.

00:27:56.841 --> 00:27:59.177
WE FIND DANGERS IN THOSE GOODS

00:27:59.244 --> 00:28:00.678
THAT CAN BE REMEDIED.

00:28:00.745 --> 00:28:02.981
AND WE IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO

00:28:03.048 --> 00:28:04.182
IMPROVE THOSE PRODUCTS TO

00:28:04.249 --> 00:28:06.184
MINIMIZE RISKS AND THAT'S AT THE

00:28:06.251 --> 00:28:07.685
THE CORE OF OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING

00:28:07.752 --> 00:28:09.020
TO DO HERE AND IT WAS TO THAT IN

00:28:09.087 --> 00:28:10.522
THE TEN YEARS AGO THE CALIFORNIA

00:28:10.588 --> 00:28:12.524
LEGISLATURE PASSED TO LAWS.

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:13.625
BOTH ME SOME IN THE SENATE SIDES

00:28:13.691 --> 00:28:14.592
THAT ESTABLISHED THE GREEN

00:28:14.659 --> 00:28:16.961
CHEMISTRY PROGRAM WITHIN THE DTS

00:28:17.028 --> 00:28:17.595
SEE THAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT

00:28:17.662 --> 00:28:18.530
TODAY.

00:28:18.596 --> 00:28:20.398
AND SO THE IDEA IS TO USE THE

00:28:20.465 --> 00:28:22.133
BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE IN AN

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.802
OPEN AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS.

00:28:23.868 --> 00:28:25.537
TO MAKE APPROPRIATE REGULATORY

00:28:25.603 --> 00:28:26.838
DECISIONS.

00:28:26.905 --> 00:28:28.907
AND WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING FROM

00:28:28.973 --> 00:28:29.507
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN

00:28:29.574 --> 00:28:31.743
WORKING TO LEARN ABOUT HOW THE

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.344
FIRST TEN YEARS HAVE GONE WE

00:28:33.411 --> 00:28:34.245
WANNA KNOW WHAT'S WORKING WELL

00:28:34.312 --> 00:28:36.848
WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS IT WE WE

00:28:36.915 --> 00:28:37.916
WE CERTAINLY WANT AND ALSO KNOW

00:28:37.982 --> 00:28:39.684
WHERE STAKEHOLDERS FEEL AS

00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:40.118
THOUGH THE PROGRAM.

00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:41.152
HAS BENEFITED CALIFORNIA

00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:42.821
BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS WHERE

00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:44.422
IT'S FALLEN SHORT.

00:28:44.489 --> 00:28:47.058
AND AND AND YOU KNOW LOOK TO TO

00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:47.992
TO TO TO SEE WHAT SORT OF

00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:48.560
LEGISLATIVE REMEDIES MAY BE

00:28:48.626 --> 00:28:49.561
NECESSARY.

00:33:22.633 --> 00:33:24.635
OTHER SIMILAR DEVELOPMENTS HAVE

00:33:24.702 --> 00:33:26.471
BEEN THINGS LIKE.

00:33:26.537 --> 00:33:28.306

FOCUSING ON CHILD SAFETY.

00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:32.276
FOCUSING ON HEALTH AND NUTRITION.

00:33:32.343 --> 00:33:33.578
THESE WELLNESS TRENDS ARE NOT

00:33:33.644 --> 00:33:36.948
NEW ST WE ARE ENTERING A NEW

00:33:37.014 --> 00:33:38.883
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT AND HAVE AN

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:41.352
OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF US TODAY.

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:42.854
FOR MANY CONSUMERS.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.489
THE MATERIAL CHEMICAL SAFETY OF

00:33:44.555 --> 00:33:45.757
PRODUCTS HAS BECOME A NEW

00:33:45.823 --> 00:33:47.558
DIMENSION OF THEIR PURCHASING

00:33:47.625 --> 00:33:48.926
DECISIONS.

00:33:48.993 --> 00:33:50.695
THIS CHANGE IN PREFERENCE IS

00:33:50.762 --> 00:33:52.964
RESHAPING ENTIRE PRODUCT

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.199
CATEGORIES AND SECTORS.

00:33:55.266 --> 00:33:56.601
A GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

00:33:56.667 --> 00:33:58.669
IDENTIFY WITH LIFESTYLES OF

00:33:58.736 --> 00:34:00.338
HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY.

00:34:00.405 --> 00:34:01.439
AND HEALTH IS THEIR BIGGEST

00:34:01.506 --> 00:34:03.107
CONCERN.

00:34:03.174 --> 00:34:04.609
SO SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT PRODUCT

00:34:04.675 --> 00:34:06.511
CATEGORIES HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED

00:34:06.577 --> 00:34:07.979
INCLUDING FOOD PERSONAL CARE

00:34:08.045 --> 00:34:09.147
CLEANING PRODUCTS AND

00:34:09.213 --> 00:34:10.381
INCREASINGLY APPAREL IN

00:34:10.448 --> 00:34:11.549
BUILDINGS.

00:34:11.616 --> 00:34:13.918
THINK ABOUT IT PEOPLE START WITH

00:34:13.985 --> 00:34:15.286
THE THINGS THEY CONSUME

00:34:15.353 --> 00:34:17.255
LITERALLY PUT IN THEIR BODY AND

00:34:17.321 --> 00:34:18.122
THEN THEY START THINKING ABOUT

00:34:18.189 --> 00:34:19.424
THE PRODUCTS THEY PUT ON THEIR

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:21.359
SKIN BRING INTO THEIR HOME AND

00:34:21.426 --> 00:34:22.860
SHARE WITH THEIR FAMILY.

00:34:22.927 --> 00:34:24.529
MANY CONSUMERS BECOME SENSITIZED

00:34:24.595 --> 00:34:26.030
TO THESE ISSUES WHEN THEY BEGIN

00:34:26.097 --> 00:34:27.498
TO HAVE FAMILIES WHEN THEY BEGIN

00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:28.499
TO HAVE CHILDREN.

00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:30.501
THIS IS A TIME WHERE PEOPLE MAKE

00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:32.303
ARE OPEN TO NEW INFORMATION AND

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:33.404
MAKE NEW DECISIONS ABOUT

00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:35.373
SWITCHING BRANDS AND CREATING

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.441
NEW HABITS.

00:34:36.507 --> 00:34:39.911
PEOPLE'S CONCERN ABOUT EXPOSURE.

00:34:39.977 --> 00:34:40.978
TO CHEMICALS --

00:34:41.045 --> 00:34:42.680
AND THE RISKS THEY PRESENT TO

00:34:42.747 --> 00:34:44.182
THEIR FAMILIES TRANSLATES INTO A

00:34:44.248 --> 00:34:45.883
MULTI BILLION DOLLAR DEMAND FOR

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:47.251
SAFER PRODUCTS AND THE

00:34:47.318 --> 00:34:49.320
CHEMISTRY'S THAT ARE NEEDED TO

00:34:49.387 --> 00:34:50.955
MAKE THEM.

00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:51.756
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE ORGANIC

00:34:51.823 --> 00:34:54.659
FOOD MOVEMENT AS A GOOD PROXY.

00:34:54.725 --> 00:34:56.093
TAKE A LOOK AT THE FACT THAT

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.629
ORGANIC FOOD HIS GROWN 12% YEAR

00:34:58.696 --> 00:34:59.897
AFTER YEAR.

00:34:59.964 --> 00:35:02.266
FROM TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR TO

00:35:02.333 --> 00:35:03.935
TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN DURING

00:35:04.001 --> 00:35:05.203
THAT AMOUNT OF TIME.

00:35:05.269 --> 00:35:06.337
THERE WERE ACQUISITIONS OF

00:35:06.404 --> 00:35:09.207
COMPANIES PUBLICLY DISCLOSED

00:35:09.273 --> 00:35:10.675
ABOUT HALF OF ALL THE ANY WORK

00:35:10.741 --> 00:35:12.543
OVER FORTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:18.783
IN NEW WEALTH CREATED FROM THE

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:19.484
ORGANIC FOOD MOVEMENT.

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:20.485
SIMILARLY AND YOU CAN SEE ON THE

00:35:20.551 --> 00:35:21.319
TABLE BELOW.

00:35:21.385 --> 00:35:22.320
COMPANIES THAT ARE LEADING --

00:35:22.386 --> 00:35:26.157
WITH MATH ARE ALL PERFORMING

00:35:26.224 --> 00:35:27.992
QUITE WELL.

00:35:28.059 --> 00:35:29.227
SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR OUR

00:35:29.293 --> 00:35:30.828
HEARING HERE TODAY.

00:35:30.895 --> 00:35:32.196
WHAT I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT

00:35:32.263 --> 00:35:33.331
TEN YEARS AGO IN CALIFORNIA

00:35:33.397 --> 00:35:34.398
LAUNCH THE GREEN CHEMISTRY

00:35:34.465 --> 00:35:35.933
INITIATIVE TO ADVANCE THE SAFER

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.602
USE OF CHEMICALS THERE WAS AS

00:35:37.668 --> 00:35:39.537
THERE IS TODAY AND DESIRE FOR

00:35:39.604 --> 00:35:41.005
HEALTHIER CHEMISTRY IN OUR

00:35:41.072 --> 00:35:42.507
PRODUCTS AND WORKPLACES?

00:35:42.573 --> 00:35:44.842
AT THAT TIME MIKE WILSON AND

00:35:44.909 --> 00:35:46.644
OTHERS IDENTIFIED THREE GAPS

00:35:46.711 --> 00:35:48.012
THAT WE'RE LIMITING THE ADOPTION

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:49.614
OF SAFER CHEMISTRY.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.215
WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS TAKE A

00:35:51.282 --> 00:35:53.684
MOMENT AND REMEMBER THOSE GAPS?

00:35:53.751 --> 00:35:55.019
BECAUSE EACH OF THOSE GAPS HAS

00:35:55.086 --> 00:35:56.287
ACTUALLY BEEN.

00:35:56.354 --> 00:35:58.823
PROVEN TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY WERE

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:01.425
RELATIVELY SMALL INVESTMENTS AND

00:36:01.492 --> 00:36:02.793
EITHER CAPITAL OR IN YOUR CASE

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:04.028
IN ACTIONS.

00:36:04.095 --> 00:36:07.064
CAN HAVE AN OUTSIZED INFLUENCE

00:36:07.131 --> 00:36:08.733
ON THE ADOPTION OF SAFER

00:36:08.799 --> 00:36:11.402
CHEMISTRY IN OUR SOCIETY.

00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:12.870
SO START WITH THE FIRST GAP.

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:15.006
THE NEED FOR INFORMATION.

00:36:15.072 --> 00:36:16.574
PROPERLY FUNCTIONING MARKETS

00:36:16.641 --> 00:36:18.476
REQUIRE THE FREE FLOW OF BOTH

00:36:18.543 --> 00:36:19.877
GOOD AND INFORMATION.

00:36:19.944 --> 00:36:21.979
WHAT WE HAVE ABUNDANT ACCESS TO

00:36:22.046 --> 00:36:23.447
PRODUCTS OF ALL SORT FROM

00:36:23.514 --> 00:36:24.949
BUILDING MATERIALS TO TOYS AND

00:36:25.016 --> 00:36:26.651
COSMETICS WE STILL HAVE ALMOST

00:36:26.717 --> 00:36:28.719
NO INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT GOES

00:36:28.786 --> 00:36:30.421
INTO THEM?

00:36:30.488 --> 00:36:31.989
IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE.

00:36:32.056 --> 00:36:34.292
THAT THIS IGNORANCE OFTEN GOES

00:36:34.358 --> 00:36:36.961
BEYOND THE CONSUMER. TO ACTUALLY

00:36:37.028 --> 00:36:38.529
THE BRANDS AND RETAILERS

00:36:38.596 --> 00:36:40.364
THEMSELVES WHO STRUGGLE TO

00:36:40.431 --> 00:36:42.433
IDENTIFY AND MANAGE POTENTIAL

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.535
CHEMICALS OF CONCERN.

00:36:44.602 --> 00:36:46.237
IN THE PAST TEN YEARS MANY

00:36:46.304 --> 00:36:47.805
BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN WORKING TO

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:48.940
SECURE INGREDIENT LEVEL

00:36:49.006 --> 00:36:50.541
INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRODUCTS

00:36:50.608 --> 00:36:52.176
THEY SELL.

00:36:52.243 --> 00:36:53.678
DESPITE RELATIVELY WEAK

00:36:53.744 --> 00:36:55.913
REGULATORY MANDATES WE'RE SEEING

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.648
BRANDS AND RETAILERS CREATING

00:36:57.715 --> 00:36:59.684
THEIR OWN CHEMICAL TRANSPARENCY

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:01.419
IN DISCLOSURE POLICIES THE GO

00:37:01.485 --> 00:37:02.954
FAR BEYOND ANY REGULATORY

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.155
REQUIREMENTS.

00:37:04.221 --> 00:37:05.723
I'VE INCLUDED IN THE TESTIMONY

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:08.793
BELOW EXAMPLES OF JUST.

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:10.027
KIND OF THE LARGEST RETAILERS OF

00:37:10.094 --> 00:37:11.295
WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN THE LAST

00:37:11.362 --> 00:37:16.901
YEAR AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON

00:37:16.968 --> 00:37:18.836
INITIATIVES LIKE MINE THE STORE.

00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:19.904
HAVE HELPED CREATE

00:37:19.971 --> 00:37:20.905
ACCOUNTABILITY AND CREATE A

00:37:20.972 --> 00:37:23.007
SENSE OF COMPETITION AMONG

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:24.942
RETAILERS TO IMPROVE THEIR

00:37:25.009 --> 00:37:26.777
GRADES ON THE ON THE SCORING

00:37:26.844 --> 00:37:28.379
SYSTEM AND ALSO GIVE SHOPPERS A

00:37:28.446 --> 00:37:29.981
SENSE OF SECURITY.

00:37:30.047 --> 00:37:31.248
THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING PEOPLE

00:37:31.315 --> 00:37:33.150
WITH THE SAFEST PRODUCTS.

00:37:33.217 --> 00:37:34.452
WELL THESE VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURES

00:37:34.518 --> 00:37:36.187
AND RESTRICTIONS BY BRANDS ARE A

00:37:36.253 --> 00:37:37.521
GOOD START.

00:37:37.588 --> 00:37:39.890
MORE MUST BE DONE TO PROVIDE

00:37:39.957 --> 00:37:41.659
INFORMATION DIRECTLY TO THE

00:37:41.726 --> 00:37:43.494
CONSUMER.

00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:45.596
THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT I CAN

00:37:45.663 --> 00:37:47.598
ORDER A TWENTY FOR MY DAUGHTER

00:37:47.665 --> 00:37:49.867
ONLINE TRACK THE PACKAGE DOWN TO

00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:52.003
THE MINUTE IT LEFT THE WAREHOUSE.

00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:53.604
AND GET A TEXT MESSAGE WHEN IT

00:37:53.671 --> 00:37:56.073
ARRIVES AT MY DOOR.

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.541
BUT ONCE I HAVE THE TOY IN HAND

00:37:57.608 --> 00:37:59.276
I WILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT

00:37:59.343 --> 00:38:02.313
MATERIALS DIES PLASTICIZERS OR

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:03.714
OTHER CHEMICALS ARE IN IT.

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:04.715
HAVE YOU SEEN THAT INGREDIENT

00:38:04.782 --> 00:38:08.085
LIST ON A TOY A PHD IN CHEMISTRY

00:38:08.152 --> 00:38:09.520
AND YET I STILL DON'T HAVE THE

00:38:09.587 --> 00:38:10.955
INFORMATION I NEED TO CHOOSE THE

00:38:11.022 --> 00:38:12.189
SAFEST PRODUCT FOR MY THREE YEAR

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:14.258
OLD DAUGHTER.

00:38:14.325 --> 00:38:15.526
WE ARE OFTEN TOLD THAT THIS

00:38:15.593 --> 00:38:17.094
INFORMATION IS A TRADE SECRET OR

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:18.295
THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE DISCLOSED

00:38:18.362 --> 00:38:19.697
BECAUSE CONSUMERS WILL NOT KNOW

00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:22.433
HOW TO INTERPRET THE INFORMATION.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.168
THE REALITY IS.

00:38:24.235 --> 00:38:25.603
THAT BOTH ARGUMENTS COULD HAVE

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:26.737
BEEN MADE FOR FOOD PACKAGING AS

00:38:26.804 --> 00:38:28.673
WELL.

00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:30.374
BUT WE'VE SEEN THAT ACCESS TO

00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:31.842
THIS SORT OF INFORMATION CREATES

00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:33.844
A WHOLE ECOSYSTEM OF EDUCATION

00:38:33.911 --> 00:38:35.780
AND COMPETITION WERE GOVERNMENT

00:38:35.846 --> 00:38:38.015
BRANDS AND CONSUMER EDUCATION

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:39.884
ALL WORK TO CONTINUE TO RAISE

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:41.185
THE BAR NUTRITION.

00:38:41.252 --> 00:38:42.687
AND COULD DO THE SAME.

00:38:42.753 --> 00:38:44.321
ON THE HEALTH OF THE CHEMICALS

00:38:44.388 --> 00:38:46.824
WE FIND OUR PRODUCTS.

00:38:46.891 --> 00:38:48.125
IN THE ABSENCE OF GOOD CHEMICAL

00:38:48.192 --> 00:38:49.794
INFORMATION WE WILL CONTINUE TO

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.896
RELY ON BANDS AND POORLY DEFINED

00:38:51.962 --> 00:38:54.398
CLAIMS THAT MAY BE MISLEADING TO

00:38:54.465 --> 00:38:55.466
THE CONSUMER WHICH BRINGS US TO

00:38:55.533 --> 00:38:56.434
THE SECOND GAP THAT WAS

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.702
IDENTIFIED.

00:38:57.768 --> 00:38:59.103
IN ADDITION TO GREATER CHEMICAL

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.971
TRANSPARENCY IT'S CRITICAL THAT

00:39:01.038 --> 00:39:01.772
WE HAVE.

00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:03.474
OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS THAT ENSURE

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:05.142
THE CONSUMERS ARE GETTING USEFUL

00:39:05.209 --> 00:39:07.712
INFORMATION.

00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:09.313
LET'S START BY THINKING BACK TO

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.182
THE EXAMPLE OF THE TOY THAT I

00:39:11.248 --> 00:39:12.249
BOUGHT.

00:39:12.316 --> 00:39:14.285
JUST FOR MY DAUGHTER IF IT'S A

00:39:14.351 --> 00:39:15.686
QUOTE UNQUOTE GREEN TôI THE

00:39:15.753 --> 00:39:17.288
PACKAGE MAY TELL ME SOMETHING

00:39:17.354 --> 00:39:19.356
ABOUT WHAT ISN'T IN THE TOY WITH

00:39:19.423 --> 00:39:21.659
ASSURANCES LIKE BPA FREE ORGANIC

00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:23.360
NATURAL OR CHEMICAL FREE MY

00:39:23.427 --> 00:39:26.363
FAVORITE.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.499
THESE LABELS DO LITTLE TO ASSURE

00:39:28.566 --> 00:39:29.066
ME.

00:39:29.133 --> 00:39:30.735
THAT THE TôI IS SOMETHING I

00:39:30.801 --> 00:39:32.169
WANT TO GIVE TO MY CHILD.

00:39:32.236 --> 00:39:33.804
AS THE CHEMIST I KNOW IF I CAN

00:39:33.871 --> 00:39:35.139
HOLD IN MY HAND IT'S MADE FROM

00:39:35.206 --> 00:39:37.308
CHEMICALS.

00:39:37.374 --> 00:39:38.743
BUT WHAT THEY ARE I CAN'T BE

00:39:38.809 --> 00:39:41.145
SURE OF IF THE LABEL SAYS

00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:42.480
NATURAL THAT MADE TELL ME

00:39:42.546 --> 00:39:43.681
SOMETHING ABOUT THE SOURCE OF

00:39:43.748 --> 00:39:44.615
RAW MATERIALS USED TO

00:39:44.682 --> 00:39:45.916
MANUFACTURE THE TOY BUT IT

00:39:45.983 --> 00:39:47.418
DOESN'T GUARANTEE THEIR SAFETY

00:39:47.485 --> 00:39:48.652
OR THAT THEY WERE PROCESS

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:49.787
WITHOUT HARMING PEOPLE OR THE

00:39:49.854 --> 00:39:50.654
ENVIRONMENT.

00:39:50.721 --> 00:39:52.289
EVEN THE TERM ORGANIC A THIRD

00:39:52.356 --> 00:39:54.091
PARTY CERTIFICATION TELLS ME

00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:55.159
LITTLE MORE THAN HOW THE RAW

00:39:55.226 --> 00:39:58.295
MATERIALS USUALLY COTTON.

00:39:58.362 --> 00:39:59.830
OR IN THE CASE OF TOWARDS OUR

00:39:59.897 --> 00:40:01.265
CLOTHES WERE GROWN IT DOESN'T

00:40:01.332 --> 00:40:03.200
TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT THE DICE

00:40:03.267 --> 00:40:05.770
FINISHES OR OTHER CHEMICALS

00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:07.371
ADDED TO MAKE THE FINAL PRODUCT.

00:40:07.438 --> 00:40:08.672
SIMILARLY MANY PRODUCTS LABELED

00:40:08.739 --> 00:40:10.541
BPA FREE DON'T MENTION THE

00:40:10.608 --> 00:40:12.443
CHEMICALS THAT ARE IN THE TOY

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:13.778
THE COULD BE JUST AS HARMFUL AS

00:40:13.844 --> 00:40:15.312
THE ONES THAT WERE LEFT OUT.

00:40:15.379 --> 00:40:16.647
INSTEAD OF BPA IT MAY HAVE BEEN

00:40:16.714 --> 00:40:20.050
MADE WITH AND BE PS WHICH

00:40:20.117 --> 00:40:21.452
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN COULD BE JUST

00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:22.586
AS DANGEROUS.

00:40:22.653 --> 00:40:24.321
THERE'S NO WAY OF KNOWING THESE

00:40:24.388 --> 00:40:26.323
REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION HAPPEN

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:27.858
MORE OFTEN THAN WE'D LIKE.

00:40:27.925 --> 00:40:29.593
BECAUSE WHEN WE BàN SPECIFIC

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.163
CHEMICALS THE EASIEST SOLUTIONS

00:40:32.229 --> 00:40:34.064
ARE DROPPING SUBSTITUTES WHICH

00:40:34.131 --> 00:40:35.266
ARE LIKELY COMPOUNDS WITH

00:40:35.332 --> 00:40:37.468
SIMILAR STRUCTURES THE COULD

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:39.537
HAVE SIMILAR HEALTH CONSEQUENCES.

00:40:39.603 --> 00:40:42.306
SAFER MADE WAS CREATED TO ENSURE

00:40:42.373 --> 00:40:44.008
THAT HAS IT IS THAT AS HAZARDOUS

00:40:44.074 --> 00:40:45.376
CHEMICALS ARE PHASED OUT.

00:40:45.442 --> 00:40:47.578
THERE WILL BE A PIPELINE A

00:40:47.645 --> 00:40:49.980
VIABLE SAFER ALTERNATIVES.

00:40:50.047 --> 00:40:52.850
IT'S SAFER MADE WE'VE DEVELOP

00:40:52.917 --> 00:40:54.418
STRATEGIES TO IDENTIFY.

00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:56.287
IN SUPPORT INHERENTLY SAFER

00:40:56.353 --> 00:40:57.888
CHEMICALS AND PRODUCTS.

00:40:57.955 --> 00:40:59.490
FIRST WE TAKE A FUNCTIONAL

00:40:59.557 --> 00:41:00.658
APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING SAFER

00:41:00.724 --> 00:41:02.326
CHEMICALS.

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:04.261
A FUNCTIONAL APPROACH REFOCUSES

00:41:04.328 --> 00:41:05.996
CHEMICAL MANAGEMENT FROM THE

00:41:06.063 --> 00:41:07.832
RISKS OF A SINGLE CHEMICAL TO

00:41:07.898 --> 00:41:09.233
VALUE WAITING ALL THE AVAILABLE

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.734
OPTIONS TO DELIVER A PARTICULAR

00:41:10.801 --> 00:41:12.469
FUNCTION.

00:41:12.536 --> 00:41:14.071
THIS FUNCTIONAL APPROACH COMES

00:41:14.138 --> 00:41:16.207
FROM A SIMPLE RECOGNITION.

00:41:16.273 --> 00:41:19.510
PEOPLE DON'T BUY CHEMICALS.

00:41:19.577 --> 00:41:21.879
THEY PAY FOR FUNCTION.

00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:23.214
PEOPLE DON'T WANT PERFLUORINATED

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.582
SURFACTANTS THAT ARE KNOWN TO

00:41:24.648 --> 00:41:25.816
PERSIST IN THE ENVIRONMENT FOR

00:41:25.883 --> 00:41:26.817
THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

00:41:26.884 --> 00:41:28.752
BUT THEY DO LIKE HAVING OVER

00:41:28.819 --> 00:41:30.221
BREATHABLE RAIN JACKET TO KEEP

00:41:30.287 --> 00:41:31.388
THEM DRY.

00:41:31.455 --> 00:41:33.290
A FUNCTIONAL APPROACH ENCOURAGES

00:41:33.357 --> 00:41:34.758
MATERIALS AND SYSTEM LEVEL

00:41:34.825 --> 00:41:36.193
CHANGE THAT PROVIDE AN

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.128
OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS BOTH THE

00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:39.563
CHEMICAL CHALLENGES AS WELL AS

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:40.831
ADDITIONAL SUSTAINABILITY IN

00:41:40.898 --> 00:41:41.732
GOALS.

00:41:41.799 --> 00:41:43.033
INCLUDING THE REDUCTION OF

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:46.003
ENERGY AND WATER USE.

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:47.204
THE OTHER THING THAT WE DO IT

00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:48.973
SAFER MADE TO AVOID REGRETTABLE

00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:51.308
SUBSTITUTION IS TAKE A CLASS

00:41:51.375 --> 00:41:52.343
APPROACH.

00:41:52.409 --> 00:41:53.744
WE LOOK AT CHEMICALS OF CONCERN

00:41:53.811 --> 00:41:55.479
AS MEMBERS OF A LARGER CHEMICAL

00:41:55.546 --> 00:41:57.615
FAMILIES WHICH ARE LIKELY TO

00:41:57.681 --> 00:41:59.650
SHARE SOME OF THE SAME.

00:41:59.717 --> 00:42:01.418
PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES

00:42:01.485 --> 00:42:03.053
CHEMICALS THAT FALL INTO KNOWN

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.889
CLASSES OF CONCERN LIKE THIS

00:42:04.955 --> 00:42:05.856
FINALS ARE PERFORMED AIDED

00:42:05.923 --> 00:42:07.424
SUBSTANCES SHOULD HAVE TO PASS A

00:42:07.491 --> 00:42:09.393
HIGHER BAR FOR SAFETY BEFORE

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:10.527
BEING USED.

00:42:10.594 --> 00:42:12.496
GROUPING CHEMICALS BY CLASS

00:42:12.563 --> 00:42:13.731
BASED ON CHEMICAL STRUCTURE IN

00:42:13.797 --> 00:42:15.566
PHYSICAL PROPERTIES IS SOMETHING

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:17.868
THAT CHEMISTS OFTEN DO QUICKLY

00:42:17.935 --> 00:42:18.936
TO EVALUATE.

00:42:19.003 --> 00:42:20.971
A NEW CHEMICAL GROUPING

00:42:21.038 --> 00:42:22.640
CHEMICALS OF CONCERN BY CLASS

00:42:22.706 --> 00:42:24.575
HELPS US MAKE SENSE OF THE TENS

00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:25.743
OF THOUSANDS OF CHEMICALS THAT

00:42:25.809 --> 00:42:26.944
WERE MENTIONED IN THE EARLIER

00:42:27.011 --> 00:42:28.112
REMARKS.

00:42:28.178 --> 00:42:30.047
AND ALLOWS US TO AVOID WASTING

00:42:30.114 --> 00:42:33.217
TIME.

00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:34.184
THIS BRINGS ME TO MY FINAL AREA

00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:36.320
OF COMMON.

00:42:36.387 --> 00:42:37.922
WHICH IS HOW DO WE TAKE

00:42:37.988 --> 00:42:39.690
ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:42:39.757 --> 00:42:42.092
CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE LEADING

00:42:42.159 --> 00:42:44.862
IN EDUCATION AND INNOVATION.

00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:45.996
INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AND

00:42:46.063 --> 00:42:47.064
ACCOUNTABILITY BOTH CREATE

00:42:47.131 --> 00:42:48.899
DEMAND.

00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:50.501
NOW WE WILL SHIFT OUR ATTENTION

00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:51.402
TO THE WAYS THAT WE CAN GROW THE

00:42:51.468 --> 00:42:52.836
SUPPLY OF C. FOR CHEMICALS AND

00:42:52.903 --> 00:42:54.104
PRODUCTS.

00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:56.106
THE GOOD NEWS IS THE CALIFORNIA

00:42:56.173 --> 00:42:57.608

00:43:18.662 --> 00:43:20.064
SOME OF WHICH ARE IN THE ROOM.

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.799
CALIFORNIA ATTRACTS MORE VENTURE

00:43:21.865 --> 00:43:23.801
CAPITAL FUNDING THAN ALL OTHER

00:43:23.867 --> 00:43:24.902

00:43:30.774 --> 00:43:32.876
ACROSS SECTORS.

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:34.144
CLEARLY WE HAVE ALL THE BUILDING

00:43:34.211 --> 00:43:36.080
BLOCKS NEEDED TO LEAD THE NATION

00:43:36.146 --> 00:43:37.414
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEXT

00:43:37.481 --> 00:43:38.749

AND FIND THE BAD ACTOR CHEMICALS.

00:44:54.591 --> 00:44:55.726
WE NEED TO START AT THE

00:44:55.793 --> 00:44:58.929
BEGINNING AND FIGURE OUT TO FILL

00:44:58.996 --> 00:44:59.496
AND HOW DO WE FILL THEM IN A

00:44:59.563 --> 00:45:01.131
BETTER WAY.

00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:02.599
THE BEST WAY.

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:48.639
SIMILAR TO WHAT I OUTLINED IN.

00:46:48.705 --> 00:46:52.109
THE RETAILERS AND BRANDS RUMORS

00:46:52.176 --> 00:46:53.977
ARE DEMANDING IT.

00:46:54.044 --> 00:46:56.380
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT LIKE THERE

00:46:56.446 --> 00:46:57.981
ARE SIMILAR WAYS THAT.

00:46:58.048 --> 00:46:59.216
ADVOCACY GROUPS LIKE THE OWN

ELIMINATE PLASTIC.

00:47:08.825 --> 00:47:10.027
AND THERE'S ALSO BEEN A NUMBER

00:47:10.093 --> 00:47:11.862
OF STATE AND LOCAL ACTIONS TO

00:47:11.929 --> 00:47:13.096
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PACKAGING

00:47:13.163 --> 00:47:15.098

BENEFITS OF SINGLE USE PACKAGING

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:28.345
WITHOUT THE UNINTENDED HARM.

00:47:28.412 --> 00:47:29.780
SEE FOR MADE IS ACTUALLY MADE TO

00:47:29.846 --> 00:47:31.748
INVESTMENTS IMPACTING COMPANIES

00:47:31.815 --> 00:47:33.584
BOTH LOCATED HERE IN CALIFORNIA --

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:36.186
AND IT'S BECAUSE THERE IS THIS

00:47:36.253 --> 00:47:37.854
SORT OF AWARENESS.

00:47:37.921 --> 00:47:39.223
SO I'D LIKE TO END WITH THE

00:47:39.289 --> 00:47:40.524
IMPORTANCE OF PARTNERSHIP.

00:47:40.591 --> 00:47:41.725
ACTIVE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN

00:47:41.792 --> 00:47:43.293
BRANDS AND RETAILERS ON ONE SIDE

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.828
RESEARCH ENTERS AND INNOVATORS

00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:46.363
ON THE OTHER HAVE THE POTENTIAL

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:47.431
TO BRING NEW PRODUCTS AND

00:47:47.497 --> 00:47:48.565
TECHNOLOGIES TO MARKET.

00:47:48.632 --> 00:47:50.467
THAT HAVE BOTH SUPERIOR

00:47:50.534 --> 00:47:52.169
PERFORMANCE AND SAFETY.

00:47:52.236 --> 00:47:53.136

WITH INDUSTRY NEEDS AND

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.388
ACCELERATE THEIR DEPLOYMENT.

00:49:18.455 --> 00:49:19.423
THERE ARE GOVERNMENT FUNDED

00:49:19.489 --> 00:49:21.058
ORGANISATIONS ALREADY SUPPORTING

00:49:21.124 --> 00:49:21.892
THE SORT OF WORK HERE IN

00:49:21.958 --> 00:49:23.593
CALIFORNIA A FEW THAT I WOULD

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:24.795
LIKE TO MENTION ARE THE USDA

00:49:24.861 --> 00:49:27.230
LABORATORY --

00:49:27.297 --> 00:49:27.731
WHICH SUPPORTS B#O BASED

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.566
MATERIALS THAT LOS ANGELES CLEAN

00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:30.967
TECH INCUBATOR.

00:49:31.034 --> 00:49:32.336
AND TO THE COW RECYCLE LOAN

00:49:32.402 --> 00:49:35.038
PROGRAM WHICH AND IS THE RE USE

00:49:35.105 --> 00:49:36.940
OF RECYCLED PRODUCTS.

00:49:37.007 --> 00:49:38.542
SAFER MADE IS WORKED WITH ALL OF

00:49:38.608 --> 00:49:40.610
THEM AND HIS WORK WITH START UP

00:49:40.677 --> 00:49:41.978
TO BENEFITTED FROM THEIR SUPPORT

00:49:42.045 --> 00:49:43.180
BUT THE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT GIVEN

00:49:43.246 --> 00:49:44.614
TO THESE ORGANIZATIONS IS

00:49:44.681 --> 00:49:46.616
MINUSCULE WHEN COMPARED TO

00:49:46.683 --> 00:49:47.751
SIMILAR AT EFFORTS AND

00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:49.886
BIOTECHNOLOGY AND ENERGY

00:49:49.953 --> 00:49:51.955
RESEARCH.

00:49:52.022 --> 00:49:52.923
I HOPE THAT I'VE CONVINCED YOU

00:49:52.989 --> 00:49:53.924
THAT THERE IS BOTH A CLEAR

00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:55.826
DEMAND FOR SAFER CHEMISTRY AS

00:49:55.892 --> 00:49:57.327
WELL AS A GROWING SUPPLY OF

00:49:57.394 --> 00:49:59.129
SAFER PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS.

00:49:59.196 --> 00:50:00.430
PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO WAKE UP

00:50:00.497 --> 00:50:02.966
TOMORROW AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT.

00:50:03.033 --> 00:50:04.835
A LITTLE BIT OF CARCINOGEN IS

00:50:04.901 --> 00:50:06.436
OKAY AND MY KIDS TOYS TODAY.

00:50:06.503 --> 00:50:08.605
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:10.107
SO OUR FOCUS NEED TO BE WORKING

00:50:10.173 --> 00:50:11.908
TOGETHER TO MAKE THE TRANSITION

00:50:11.975 --> 00:50:13.443
TO HEALTHIER CHEMISTRY AND SAFER

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:15.011
PRODUCTS HAPPEN FASTER AND

00:50:15.078 --> 00:50:16.847
HAPPEN IN A WAY THAT BRINGS

00:50:16.913 --> 00:50:18.281
BENEFITS TO ALL CONSUMERS.

00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:19.716
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS HAVE

00:50:19.783 --> 00:50:20.751
BEEN MADE INTO THE CURRENT

00:50:20.817 --> 00:50:22.085
SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION AND

00:50:22.152 --> 00:50:23.687
COMMENSURATE INVESTMENT WILL BE

00:50:23.754 --> 00:50:25.155
NEEDED TO TRANSITION US TO A

00:50:25.222 --> 00:50:26.623
CLEANER ECONOMY.

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:28.091
IS A GREAT TIME TO BE WORKING

00:50:28.158 --> 00:50:30.127
AND LEADING ON THIS ISSUE EVEN

00:50:30.193 --> 00:50:31.428
WHEN RELATIVELY MODEST

00:50:31.495 --> 00:50:32.996
INVESTMENT IN ACTION CAN MAKE

00:50:33.063 --> 00:50:35.232
SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON THE SPEED

00:50:35.298 --> 00:50:36.900
INTRODUCTORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT

00:50:36.967 --> 00:50:38.301
OF SAFER CHEMISTRY.

00:50:38.368 --> 00:50:40.337
I HOPE THAT YOU ARE EXCITED TO

00:50:40.404 --> 00:50:43.106
JOIN ME IN ACCELERATING A FUTURE

00:50:43.173 --> 00:50:44.674
FOR CALIFORNIA THAT IS SAFER.

00:50:44.741 --> 00:50:46.910
AND MORE PROSPEROUS FOR US IN

00:50:46.977 --> 00:50:48.912
MORE IMPORTANTLY OUR CHILDREN

00:50:48.979 --> 00:50:50.213
THANK YOU.

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.815
THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT WILL HAVE

00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:53.617
SOME QUESTIONS I'M SURE.

00:50:53.683 --> 00:50:55.318
A DOCTOR MOBILE HELL BUT I WANT

00:50:55.385 --> 00:50:57.721
TO SAY HOW EXCELLENT YOUR

00:50:57.788 --> 00:51:00.023
TESTIMONY WISE AND FOR ANYONE

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:01.625
WHO WANTS --

00:51:01.691 --> 00:51:03.827
TO LOOK AT A WRITTEN COPY OF THE

00:51:03.894 --> 00:51:06.196
TESTIMONY I IT IS ON THE WEBSITE

00:51:06.263 --> 00:51:07.697
IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND

00:51:07.764 --> 00:51:09.332
TOXIC MATERIALS --

00:51:09.399 --> 00:51:13.036
WEBSITE SO YOU CAN GET IN THERE

00:51:13.103 --> 00:51:15.705
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRIAN DOLLY.

00:51:15.772 --> 00:51:17.741
WHO IS MY FAVORITE --

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:19.609
EXPRESSION FOR HIM IS THAT FROM

00:51:19.676 --> 00:51:20.444
HIM IS THAT HE IS

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:22.078
ENVIRONMENTALIST BECAUSE HE IS A

00:51:22.145 --> 00:51:23.613
FARMER.

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.849
AND FARMERS REALLY HAVE TO

00:51:25.916 --> 00:51:27.884
PROTECT THE LAND.

00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:30.086
WOULD YOU LIKE.

00:51:30.153 --> 00:51:30.854
TO SAY A WORD TO THANK YOU FOR

00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:32.155
THE KIND WORDS IT'S GOOD TO BE

00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:33.957
BACK ON THE COMMITTEE I SERVED

00:51:34.024 --> 00:51:35.192
FIVE YEARS ON THE COMMITTEE TOOK

00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:37.093
A BREAK LAST YEAR AND I'M REALLY

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.728
GLAD TO BE BACK IN.

00:51:38.795 --> 00:51:40.363
GET IN THE MIDDLE OF THINGS THAT

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:42.098
THAT WE ALL CARE ABOUT AND THANK

00:51:42.165 --> 00:51:45.936
YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY.

00:51:46.002 --> 00:51:47.137
ALL RIGHT --

00:51:47.204 --> 00:51:48.905
SO --

00:51:48.972 --> 00:51:50.440
SENATORS --

00:51:50.507 --> 00:51:54.778
YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:55.645
OKAY GUY HAD --

00:51:55.712 --> 00:51:57.380
SENATOR YEAH I JUST TELL ME WHAT

00:51:57.447 --> 00:52:00.083
YOU GO WHAT WHAT HOW HOW DO YOU

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:02.752
AND INCORPORATE THE CURRENT

00:52:02.819 --> 00:52:04.521
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WHEN YOU'RE

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:05.388
MAKING YOUR INVESTMENT DECISIONS

00:52:05.455 --> 00:52:08.191
HOW HOW DO YOU.

00:52:08.258 --> 00:52:10.260
HOW DO YOU --

00:52:10.327 --> 00:52:11.294
YEAH THAT'S MY QUESTION.

00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:13.163
NO AND IT PROVIDES A VALUABLE.

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:15.532
INFORMATION SO THE FIRST AND

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:16.233
EASIEST WAY TO ANSWER THAT

00:52:16.299 --> 00:52:17.234
QUESTION.

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.835
IS WHEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:52:18.902 --> 00:52:22.372
WENT AHEAD AND IDENTIFIED OVER

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:22.973
THIRTY THREE HUNDRED CHEMICALS

00:52:23.039 --> 00:52:24.841
OF CONCERN RIGHT TO NOT THE

00:52:24.908 --> 00:52:25.842
PRODUCT CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS

00:52:25.909 --> 00:52:28.044
BUT THE LIST OF LISTS AS IT WAS

00:52:28.111 --> 00:52:29.045
CALLED.

00:52:29.112 --> 00:52:31.381
THAT GIVES US AN EXTERNAL

00:52:31.448 --> 00:52:33.183
VALIDATION FOR THIS APPROACH IT

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:34.451
ALLOWS US TO SAY WE'RE NOT GOING

00:52:34.518 --> 00:52:35.418
TO INVEST IN ANYTHING THAT USES

00:52:35.485 --> 00:52:37.287
THESE CHEMISTRIES FOR TALKING

00:52:37.354 --> 00:52:37.954
ABOUT THE FUTURE.

00:52:38.021 --> 00:52:38.989
I DON'T CARE WHERE THE RATES

00:52:39.055 --> 00:52:40.457
WERE PRIORITIES ARE IF THESE

00:52:40.524 --> 00:52:42.058
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY CHEMICAL

00:52:42.125 --> 00:52:43.393
AS CHEMICALS OF CONCERN.

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:45.562
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO THERE --

00:52:45.629 --> 00:52:48.565
AND SO I USE LISTS LIKE THE WITH

00:52:48.632 --> 00:52:50.867
OUR INNOVATORS AND SAY HEY IF

00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:52.002
YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING IN THIS

00:52:52.068 --> 00:52:53.837
AREA UNITE NEED TO NOT ONLY USE

00:52:53.904 --> 00:52:55.372
ANY OF THESE CHEMICALS.

00:52:55.438 --> 00:52:56.673
I ALSO INCORPORATE THE CLASS

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.341
BASED APPROACH AND SAY YOU CAN'T

00:52:58.408 --> 00:52:59.743
USE ANY CHEMICALS THAT ARE.

00:52:59.809 --> 00:53:01.778
IN THE CLASS OF THESE CHEMICALS

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:03.280
THAT ARE ON THIS LIST SO I TAKE

00:53:03.346 --> 00:53:05.148
THAT LIST AS A STARTING PLACE.

00:53:05.215 --> 00:53:06.416
AND THEN BROUGHT IT USING THE

00:53:06.483 --> 00:53:08.084
CLASS APPROACH.

00:53:08.151 --> 00:53:10.253
WHAT ABOUT SO BUT I GUESS MY

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:10.554
[inaudible]

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:12.389
I'M.

00:53:12.455 --> 00:53:13.590
TOTALLY GET THAT AND THAT WOULD

00:53:13.657 --> 00:53:15.058
MAKE SENSE GIVEN GIVEN YOUR WHAT

00:53:15.125 --> 00:53:16.059
YOU DO.

00:53:16.126 --> 00:53:18.695
BUT BROADLY SPEAKING YOU'RE

00:53:18.762 --> 00:53:20.163
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:21.631
SOME CHEMICAL WHAT WHAT IS AND

00:53:21.698 --> 00:53:22.832
WHAT ARE SOME SOME SOME GREEN

00:53:22.899 --> 00:53:24.501
CHEMICAL PRODUCTS.

00:53:24.568 --> 00:53:26.670
THAT WILL BE THAT WILL ACTUALLY

00:53:26.736 --> 00:53:28.505
GROW RIGHT THEY'LL MAKE MONEY

00:53:28.572 --> 00:53:30.607
THAT -- YOU

00:53:30.674 --> 00:53:31.708
KNOW WITHOUT GETTING TOO MUCH IN

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:32.909
YOUR BUSINESS MODEL.

00:53:32.976 --> 00:53:34.311
ARE YOU ARE YOU.

00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:34.878
ARE YOU SORT OF TRYING TO

00:53:34.945 --> 00:53:36.246
ANTICIPATE WHERE GOVERNMENTS

00:53:36.313 --> 00:53:37.714
WILL GO.

00:53:37.781 --> 00:53:39.316
IN GREATER REGULATION.

00:53:39.382 --> 00:53:40.150
AND WHERE YOUR SENSE OF THE

00:53:40.216 --> 00:53:41.718
PRODUCT.

00:53:41.785 --> 00:53:43.787
DEMAND WILL BE IN THE FUTURE IS

00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:45.522
THAT YOU HAVE TO KIND OF CREATED

00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:46.823
A COMPLICATED MATRIX THAT

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:48.158
INCORPORATES ALL THOSE THINGS.

00:53:48.224 --> 00:53:49.993
WE DO AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.194
THERE IN A RELATED.

00:53:51.261 --> 00:53:53.430
RIGHT SO WE FOLLOW THE CONSUMER.

00:53:53.496 --> 00:53:54.531
THE CONSUMER FOLLOWS THE

00:53:54.598 --> 00:53:56.066
INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE TO

00:53:56.132 --> 00:53:57.367
THEM SOMETIMES THROUGH ADVOCACY

00:53:57.434 --> 00:53:59.069
GROUP SOMETIMES THROUGH

00:53:59.135 --> 00:54:00.704
REGULATORY AGENCIES.

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:01.938
AND THE BRANDS AND AND RETAILERS

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:04.741
TO ME --

00:54:04.808 --> 00:54:06.142
FOLLOW THOSE THOSE MARKET

00:54:06.209 --> 00:54:09.145
SIGNALS SO WE DO TRY TO LOOK

00:54:09.212 --> 00:54:11.915
INTO THE FUTURE AND SAY WHERE.

00:54:11.982 --> 00:54:13.550
IS THE CONSUMER MOVING AND LIKE

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:15.652
I SAID IT IT OFTEN STARTS WITH

00:54:15.719 --> 00:54:17.120
FOOD RIGHT AND THEN IT MOVES

00:54:17.187 --> 00:54:18.455
FROM FOOD TO PERSONAL CARE

00:54:18.521 --> 00:54:20.056
PRODUCTS AND FROM THAT. TO

00:54:20.123 --> 00:54:21.291
TEXTILES IN THE BUILT

00:54:21.358 --> 00:54:22.592
ENVIRONMENT.

00:54:22.659 --> 00:54:24.227
AND FOR EXAMPLE THE WIN

00:54:24.294 --> 00:54:26.863
CALIFORNIA NAMED --

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:29.265
THE POLYURETHANE FOAM AS A

00:54:29.332 --> 00:54:31.334
PRODUCT CHEMICAL COMBINATION

00:54:31.401 --> 00:54:33.470
WITH MD I THE WAY I LOOK AT THAT

00:54:33.536 --> 00:54:35.171
AS A SIGNAL THAT POLYURETHANE

00:54:35.238 --> 00:54:38.308
EXPRESSLY USED IN CONSUMER

00:54:38.375 --> 00:54:38.608
[inaudible]

00:54:38.675 --> 00:54:40.377
PLACES IS.

00:54:40.443 --> 00:54:43.947
NOT A LONG TERM VIABLE ANSWER

00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:45.749
FOR INSULATION SO THAT.

00:54:45.815 --> 00:54:47.050
EVEN THOUGH CALIFORNIA'S ONLY

00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:48.718
LOOKING AT THE PARTICULAR

00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:50.320
CHEMICAL PRODUCT COMBINATION IT

00:54:50.387 --> 00:54:51.154
TELLS ME THAT THERE'S AN

00:54:51.221 --> 00:54:53.089
OPPORTUNITY TO SHIFT INSULATION

00:54:53.156 --> 00:54:54.090
MATERIALS.

00:54:54.157 --> 00:54:55.692
AND CONSUMERS ARE AKC ASKING

00:54:55.759 --> 00:54:56.726
THAT QUESTION.

00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:58.128
SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT

00:54:58.194 --> 00:54:59.963
THERE IS A A MATRIX OF INTERPLAY

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:02.732
HERE WHERE GOVERNMENT ADVOCACY

00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:04.634
ORGANIZATIONS AND BUSINESS ALL

00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:07.070
PLAY A PART TO DRIVE THE DEMAND.

00:55:07.137 --> 00:55:09.539
AND WHERE WE SHOULD FOCUS IS ON

00:55:09.606 --> 00:55:11.041
THAT SIDE OF THINGS IF YOU START

00:55:11.107 --> 00:55:12.008
WITH THE CHEMICAL COMPANIES

00:55:12.075 --> 00:55:13.910
THEMSELVES THEY WILL ALWAYS TELL

00:55:13.977 --> 00:55:15.078
YOU EVERY TIME.

00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:17.947
THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE AND THAT WE

00:55:18.014 --> 00:55:19.916
HAVE TO DO WHAT WE DO TODAY AND

00:55:19.983 --> 00:55:20.784
THEY DO THAT NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:22.752
BAD THOSE CAMPS ARE GREAT PEOPLE

00:55:22.819 --> 00:55:23.687
THEY DO THAT BECAUSE THEY'VE

00:55:23.753 --> 00:55:25.021
INVESTED IN AMORTIZE THEIR

00:55:25.088 --> 00:55:26.589
ASSETS OVER.

00:55:26.656 --> 00:55:28.258
LONG TIME FRAMES SO SHIFTING

00:55:28.324 --> 00:55:29.959
IT'S HARD IF YOU'RE AT THAT PART

00:55:30.026 --> 00:55:31.561
OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN.

00:55:31.628 --> 00:55:33.863
IF YOU'RE TOWARDS THE CONSUMER

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:36.232
INTO THE SUPPLY CHAIN GET OUT

00:55:36.299 --> 00:55:37.534
AROUND THE WORLD WHERE WHERE DO

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:38.935
YOU THINK WHICH WHICH

00:55:39.002 --> 00:55:40.470
JURISDICTION YOU THINK --

00:55:40.537 --> 00:55:42.338
IS IS IS THE BEST IN THIS AREA

00:55:42.405 --> 00:55:45.075
WHAT WHERE SHOULD WE BE LOOKING.

00:55:45.141 --> 00:55:47.210
FOR GUIDANCE AND AND HOW TO GO

00:55:47.277 --> 00:55:50.847
POLICY WISE IN THE COMMISSARY.

00:55:50.914 --> 00:55:51.448
VERY HELPFUL WITH A THAT THE

00:55:51.514 --> 00:55:52.248
EUROPEAN UNION HAS --

00:55:52.315 --> 00:55:54.517
THE REACH PROCESS THAT PROVIDES

00:55:54.584 --> 00:55:58.521
A BASS LINE LEVEL OF INFORMATION.

00:55:58.588 --> 00:55:59.989
FOR CHEMICALS ENTERING THE

00:56:00.056 --> 00:56:02.058
MARKET PLACE THAT.

00:56:02.125 --> 00:56:03.693
IN MY OPINION THAT MODEL

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:05.462
PROVIDING.

00:56:05.528 --> 00:56:07.931
A BASELINE OF SAFETY INFORMATION.

00:56:07.997 --> 00:56:09.365
COUPLED WITH MORE ACTION WHICH

00:56:09.432 --> 00:56:11.468
WE HAVEN'T SEEN TAKEN IN MANY

00:56:11.534 --> 00:56:13.436
PLACES ON DISCLOSURE OF WHAT'S

00:56:13.503 --> 00:56:15.205
ACTUALLY IN PRODUCTS ARE THE TWO

00:56:15.271 --> 00:56:17.707
MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ROLES THE

00:56:17.774 --> 00:56:18.975
GOVERNMENT COMPLY.

00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:20.009
SO THAT.

00:56:20.076 --> 00:56:20.977
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE THE

00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:23.146
WINNERS AND LOSERS YOU JUST HAVE

00:56:23.213 --> 00:56:24.881
TO SET THE THE PLAYING FIELD AND

00:56:24.948 --> 00:56:26.750
SAY THIS IS WITH THE INFORMATION

00:56:26.816 --> 00:56:28.618
YOU HAVE TO SHARE.

00:56:28.685 --> 00:56:31.387
AND EVERY OTHER PEOPLE WILL BE

00:56:31.454 --> 00:56:33.056
ABLE TO TAKE ACTION ACROSS.

00:56:33.123 --> 00:56:33.957
MY LAST QUITE THAT'S GOOD K. SO

00:56:34.023 --> 00:56:35.024
DISCLOSURE INFORMATION AND

00:56:35.091 --> 00:56:37.827
THAT'S AT THE HEART OF THE OF

00:56:37.894 --> 00:56:40.363
THE SOLOMON --

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:41.865
LATER THE RECOMMENDATIONS I FELT

00:56:41.931 --> 00:56:42.999
QUESTIONS WHAT DO YOU WISH THE

00:56:43.066 --> 00:56:44.667
GENERAL PUBLIC HAD A BETTER

00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:47.137
UNDERSTANDING OF IN THIS AREA --

00:56:47.203 --> 00:56:49.339
I WISH THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC

00:56:49.405 --> 00:56:51.808
DID THINK OF NUTRITION AND

00:56:51.875 --> 00:56:53.676
HEALTH MORE HOLISTICALLY SO THAT

00:56:53.743 --> 00:56:55.111
IT ISN'T JUST THE FOOD WE EAT IN

00:56:55.178 --> 00:56:56.546
THE ACTIONS WE TAKE.

00:56:56.613 --> 00:56:57.881
IT IS ALL OF THE PRODUCTS THAT

00:56:57.947 --> 00:56:59.149
WE BRING INTO OUR HOME THIS IS

00:56:59.215 --> 00:57:00.016
PART.

00:57:00.083 --> 00:57:01.785
OF A MUCH BROADER CONVERSATION

00:57:01.851 --> 00:57:03.353
ABOUT HEALTH --

00:57:03.419 --> 00:57:05.021
AND I THINK WE SHOULD TREAT IT

00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:06.623
THAT WAY IF YOU LOOK AT CANCER

00:57:06.689 --> 00:57:08.591
OFTEN PEOPLE THINK CANCER IS --

00:57:08.658 --> 00:57:11.094
EITHER GENETICALLY LINKED OR

00:57:11.161 --> 00:57:12.495
CONCORD ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

00:57:12.562 --> 00:57:14.130
WHAT ARE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

00:57:14.197 --> 00:57:16.332
ITS DIET IT'S OUT LIFESTYLE

00:57:16.399 --> 00:57:17.567
ACTIVITY AND IT'S THE CHEMICALS

00:57:17.634 --> 00:57:19.169
THAT ARE IN YOUR DAILY LIFE.

00:57:19.235 --> 00:57:20.904
RIGHT WE NEED TO THINK OF THIS

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:22.872
AS A AS A PART OF OUR NUTRITION

00:57:22.939 --> 00:57:24.007
AND WELLNESS THAT'S HOW.

00:57:24.073 --> 00:57:25.375
AND I ACTUALLY SEE THAT IN TWO

00:57:25.441 --> 00:57:26.709
WAYS BECAUSE USUALLY WHAT I FIND

00:57:26.776 --> 00:57:28.244
IS EITHER CONSUMERS KNOW NOTHING

00:57:28.311 --> 00:57:29.979
OR THEIR NEW PARENT AND THEY'RE

00:57:30.046 --> 00:57:31.347
AFRAID OF EVERYTHING.

00:57:31.414 --> 00:57:33.817
LIKE THERE'S VERY FEW THINGS IN

00:57:33.883 --> 00:57:34.584
THE MIDDLE.

00:57:34.651 --> 00:57:36.419
THE REALITY IS WE'RE NOT GONNA

00:57:36.486 --> 00:57:39.589
HAVE ZERO HARM PRODUCTS I DON'T

00:57:39.656 --> 00:57:40.957
NECESSARILY THINK THAT'S

00:57:41.024 --> 00:57:42.592
POSSIBLE.

00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:43.793
BUT IF YOU WE HAVE EDU IF WE CAN

00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:45.261
MAKE EDUCATED DECISIONS ABOUT

00:57:45.328 --> 00:57:47.564
WHAT IS HEALTHIEST FOR US WHAT

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:48.898
ARE THE BEST THINGS TO BRING

00:57:48.965 --> 00:57:50.200
INTO OUR HOUSE SO WE CAN TRADE

00:57:50.266 --> 00:57:51.467
OFF PERFORMANCE FOR POTENTIAL

00:57:51.534 --> 00:57:52.502
HARM.

00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:55.038
RIGHT NOW WE CAN'T DO THAT --

00:57:55.104 --> 00:58:00.443
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM --

00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:01.644
JUST A SECOND I'M GONNA

00:58:01.711 --> 00:58:03.179
INTRODUCE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AL

00:58:03.246 --> 00:58:04.848
MURATSUCHI ANOTHER --

00:58:04.914 --> 00:58:06.249
PERSON VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:07.584
ENVIRONMENT WE HAD MANY

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:09.786
DISCUSSIONS OVER THE YEARS WHERE

00:58:09.853 --> 00:58:11.387
HE HAS BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE

00:58:11.454 --> 00:58:12.655
WITH ME --

00:58:12.722 --> 00:58:14.290
DID YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY

00:58:14.357 --> 00:58:16.359
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.

00:58:16.426 --> 00:58:16.693
THAT HAVE --

00:58:16.759 --> 00:58:18.928
INTERACT REMARKS BUT I DID HAVE

00:58:18.995 --> 00:58:20.997
QUESTIONS EIGHT YOU KNOW OKAY

00:58:21.064 --> 00:58:22.232
WELL WE'LL GO THE ASSEMBLY

00:58:22.298 --> 00:58:23.566
MEMBER DOLLY AND THEN ASSEMBLY

00:58:23.633 --> 00:58:26.069
MEMBER MURATSUCHI AND THEN

00:58:26.135 --> 00:58:27.604
ANYONE ELSE.

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:29.539
SO I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON

00:58:29.606 --> 00:58:30.673
THE SENATOR'S COMMENTS SO IT YOU

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:31.341
KNOW AS LEGISLATORS WE ARE FACED

00:58:31.407 --> 00:58:33.376
WITH.

00:58:33.443 --> 00:58:34.844
A LOT OF DECISIONS AM AND WHEN

00:58:34.911 --> 00:58:36.346
WE PUT SOMETHING INTO LAW.

00:58:36.412 --> 00:58:38.414
IT CHANGES THE PLAYING FIELD

00:58:38.481 --> 00:58:40.717
DRASTICALLY SALAMI ARMS WILL

00:58:40.783 --> 00:58:43.086
DROP FISHER SO I I SERVED ON THE

00:58:43.152 --> 00:58:43.720
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FOR SIXTEEN

00:58:43.786 --> 00:58:44.621
YEARS.

00:58:44.687 --> 00:58:45.788
AND WE HAD A COMMUNITY THAT ONE

00:58:45.855 --> 00:58:46.689
TO FLOOR NATE THEIR WATER.

00:58:46.756 --> 00:58:48.958
OKAY TO SAVE CAVITIES FOR

00:58:49.025 --> 00:58:50.293
CHILDREN.

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.327
BASICALLY --

00:58:51.394 --> 00:58:51.628
WHO WEREN'T?

00:58:51.694 --> 00:58:55.765
DOING G..

00:58:55.832 --> 00:58:56.933
AND MAY TAKE SOME THAT CREATED

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:01.104
OF TSUNAMI OF OPINIONS ABOUT

00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:02.272
WHETHER WE SHOULD BE FORTY OUR

00:59:02.338 --> 00:59:05.174
WATER WHICH IS CAN CAN KILL YOU.

00:59:05.241 --> 00:59:06.643
THE CHEMICAL RIGHT SOME WOULD

00:59:06.709 --> 00:59:08.244
SAY THAT AND WHICH WE GET PAID

00:59:08.311 --> 00:59:09.712
OPINIONS ON ALL SIDES.

00:59:09.779 --> 00:59:10.313
AND WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY MAKE

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:12.649
GOOD DECISIONS UPON THOSE

00:59:12.715 --> 00:59:15.418
OPINIONS IN AND STE ONE SIDE IS

00:59:15.485 --> 00:59:16.452
ON ONE SIDE ONE SIDE IS ON THE

00:59:16.519 --> 00:59:17.887
OTHER ONE DENTIST ON THE SIDE

00:59:17.954 --> 00:59:18.755
ONE ON THE SITE.

00:59:18.821 --> 00:59:20.423
AND WE HAVE THE FAMILIES IN

00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:21.691
BETWEEN.

00:59:21.758 --> 00:59:22.625
SO.

00:59:22.692 --> 00:59:24.127
I WOULD LIKE TO IN AND IN WHAT

00:59:24.193 --> 00:59:25.828
YOU SAID I HEARD EARLIER ABOUT

00:59:25.895 --> 00:59:27.897
YOU KNOW THE MARKET DRIVES.

00:59:27.964 --> 00:59:29.465
THE CONSUMER TO DO CERTAIN

00:59:29.532 --> 00:59:30.533
THINGS BASED OFF OF WHAT THEY

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:32.168
KNOW.

00:59:32.235 --> 00:59:35.338
SO. FOR ME IT BE VERY HELPFUL.

00:59:35.405 --> 00:59:36.806
IF IN THESE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE

00:59:36.873 --> 00:59:38.241
HAVE IN IN THIS COMMITTEE TO

00:59:38.308 --> 00:59:41.277
COME UP ALL THE TIME OF OF ONE

00:59:41.344 --> 00:59:42.879
VERSUS THE OTHER AND WHAT'S THE

00:59:42.946 --> 00:59:44.480
PUBLIC BENEFIT VERSUS THE

00:59:44.547 --> 00:59:45.481
PERSONAL.

00:59:45.548 --> 00:59:46.950
CHOICE THAT YOU WANT HAVE AND SO

00:59:47.016 --> 00:59:48.985
HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU YOU GIVE

00:59:49.052 --> 00:59:50.620
US AS LEGISLATORS.

00:59:50.687 --> 00:59:52.555
A BOUNDARY OF HOW WE ENGAGE IN

00:59:52.622 --> 00:59:54.657
THOSE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND

00:59:54.724 --> 00:59:54.924
ACTUALLY.

00:59:54.991 --> 00:59:55.458
GIVE.

00:59:55.525 --> 00:59:58.528
PERSONAL CHOICE AND AND ALSO

00:59:58.594 --> 00:59:59.429
PROTECT THE PUBLIC AT THE SAME

00:59:59.495 --> 01:00:01.831
TIME.

01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:03.433
YEAH I MEAN THAT IS.

01:00:03.499 --> 01:00:05.468
THE TRICKY BALANCE TO WALK AND I

01:00:05.535 --> 01:00:07.003
THINK THE SAFE PLACES TO WALK IN

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:09.639
MY OPINION ARE AROUND.

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:11.307
TRANSPARENCY AND INFORMATION

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:12.976
DISCLOSURE THESE ARE PLACES

01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:15.812
WHERE WE SEE WE IT WAS FUN TO BE

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:18.247
WORKING WITH COMPANIES AS DTS

01:00:18.314 --> 01:00:20.717
DTS C. ROLLED OUT THEIR FIRST

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:22.518
THREE PRIORITY PRODUCTS.

01:00:22.585 --> 01:00:24.187
THREE PRIORITY PRODUCTS RIGHT.

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:26.689
I SAW INDUSTRIES ALL OVER BEING

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:27.790
WORRIED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO

01:00:27.857 --> 01:00:29.125
BE ONE OF THE THREE AND PRO

01:00:29.192 --> 01:00:30.727
ACTIVELY REMOVING CHEMICALS OF

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:31.961
CONCERN THAT WERE ON THAT LIST

01:00:32.028 --> 01:00:34.998
OF TWENTY THREE HUNDRED OR

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:36.733
THIRTY THREE HUNDRED AT THE TIME --

01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:37.800
THEY WERE ACTING PROACTIVELY

01:00:37.867 --> 01:00:39.902
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT THE

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:41.571
TARGET PUT ON THEM RIGHT AND

01:00:41.637 --> 01:00:42.972
THAT TARGET IS JUST AN

01:00:43.039 --> 01:00:45.475
INFORMATION TARGET IT'S NOT EVEN

01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:45.875
A BAND.

01:00:45.942 --> 01:00:46.876
RIGHT -- SO

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:49.645
I THINK IN THIS AREA OF

01:00:49.712 --> 01:00:50.713
CHEMICALS IN PARTICULAR

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:52.682
INFORMATION IS OUR MOST POWERFUL

01:00:52.749 --> 01:00:53.750
TOOL.

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:56.886
AND WORSE SO FAR AWAY FROM THE

01:00:56.953 --> 01:00:58.421
SATURATION POINT OF THE

01:00:58.488 --> 01:00:59.622
INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE MADE

01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:01.190
AVAILABLE THAT THAT IS A SAFE

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:04.427
PLACE THAT WILL BOTH HAVE

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:06.295
POSITIVE IMPACT.

01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:08.531
ARM AND NOT BE CHOOSING WINNERS

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:08.831
OR LOSERS.

01:01:08.898 --> 01:01:10.166
RIGHT ARM I THINK THAT THERE

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:12.468
SHOULD BE CASES PROBABLY WHEN

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:15.271
THERE IS ENOUGH DATA FOR DTS SEE

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:16.005
ANOTHER TO TAKE REGULATORY

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:17.040
ACTION THEY SHOULD HAVE THAT

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:18.374
AUTHORITY.

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:19.942
WRITES THAT COMES WITH ART ONCE

01:01:20.009 --> 01:01:21.044
YOU'VE MADE THE INFORMATION

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:22.612
AVAILABLE THEY SHOULD HAVE THE

01:01:22.678 --> 01:01:23.713
AUTHORITY TO ACT.

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:25.181
BUT I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IN THE

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:27.550
NEAR TERM IS THE MOST POWERFUL

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:29.185
TOOL WE HAVE.

01:01:29.252 --> 01:01:31.854
FINANCE YOUR QUESTION

01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:32.155
[inaudible]

01:01:32.221 --> 01:01:33.056
NOT ENOUGH [inaudible]

01:01:33.122 --> 01:01:37.927
NOT QUITE.

01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:40.229
I WOULD SUPPORT FOR NATION WATER

01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:43.199
BASED ON THE SCIENCE IS OUT

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:43.833
THERE BUT THAT WASN'T A QUESTION

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.402
LIKELY.

01:01:46.469 --> 01:01:48.304
IT -- YEAH

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:49.605
IT IS HARD BRIAN I UNDERSTAND

01:01:49.672 --> 01:01:51.808
AND I JUST WANT TO MAYBE JUST

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:53.042
THAT MORE OF JUST A COMMENT IS

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:54.944
THAT.

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:56.879
NO PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF OF

01:01:56.946 --> 01:01:58.414
WHOEVER'S ON WHATEVER POWER

01:01:58.481 --> 01:02:00.249
BROKER OR WHATEVER MEDIA'S

01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:01.951
PUSHING OR WHATEVER GROUP IS

01:02:02.018 --> 01:02:03.419
TRYING TO SELL SOMETHING THAT

01:02:03.486 --> 01:02:04.654
DEPENDS ON HOW GOOD OF A JOB

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.090
MARKETING THEIR PRODUCT.

01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:08.925
TO PUT THE SCARE OR THE YOU KNOW

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:10.059
THERE'S A MEAN EVERYTHING CAUSES

01:02:10.126 --> 01:02:12.161
CANCER IN THE LIST IS VERY DEEP

01:02:12.228 --> 01:02:13.830
AND LONG AND WHITE --

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:15.631
BUT YOU KNOW I GO BACK TO

01:02:15.698 --> 01:02:16.466
SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:18.734
KNOWS AND MOST OF US THERE'S NO

01:02:18.801 --> 01:02:20.303
THAT YOU KNOW THERE IS THIS.

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:21.104
WE SHOULD NEVER CUT A TREE IN

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:22.638
THE FOREST BECAUSE IT WAS THE

01:02:22.705 --> 01:02:23.706
WRONG THING TO DO WHEN WE SHOULD

01:02:23.773 --> 01:02:25.241
BE CUTTING TREES AND SO BECAUSE

01:02:25.308 --> 01:02:27.243
THE PUBLIC DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:28.945
THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT DOING

01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:31.280
SOMETHING SO I TRY TO THAT'S WHY

01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:33.082
I'M LOOKING FOR IS THAT BALANCE

01:02:33.149 --> 01:02:35.485
OF AND WE HAVE THOSE DECISIONS

01:02:35.551 --> 01:02:36.285
MAKE IN THEIR HARD DECISION TO

01:02:36.352 --> 01:02:36.953
MAKE WHEN YOU HAVE.

01:02:37.019 --> 01:02:38.554
YOUR WHOLE CONSTITUENTS I MEAN

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:39.689
WE WE WENT THROUGH.

01:02:39.755 --> 01:02:40.957
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE

01:02:41.023 --> 01:02:42.959
VACCINATIONS WHETHER YOU SHOULD

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:43.593
VACCINATE OR NOT ACTING I MEAN

01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:44.760
TRUST ME.

01:02:44.827 --> 01:02:46.796
YOU CAN GET VERY OF ME ALMOST

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:47.964
GET KNOCKED OUT YOUR OFFICE FROM

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:48.798
SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:49.699
CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:02:49.765 --> 01:02:51.000
AND WE'RE WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:52.802
UPON THEIR CHILDREN'S LIVES AND

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:55.304
WHEN IT BECOMES A MOTIONAL AND

01:02:55.371 --> 01:02:56.172
DRIVEN.

01:02:56.239 --> 01:02:58.107
IT'S IT'S SO I I'M TRYING TO

01:02:58.174 --> 01:03:00.576
FIND A PLACE WE NATION WITHOUT

01:03:00.643 --> 01:03:02.545
ALL THE HYPE.

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.480
SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE THE

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:05.982
TIME TO READ THE INFORMATION.

01:03:06.048 --> 01:03:09.585
FROM EXPERTS WHO HAVE A NON BIAS.

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:12.188
OPINION ON THIS IS THE FAX THEN

01:03:12.255 --> 01:03:14.290
YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE A DECISION

01:03:14.357 --> 01:03:18.194
THAT IS EDUCATED AND CLOSE TO AS

01:03:18.261 --> 01:03:19.195
GOOD AS IT'S GONNA GET.

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:19.562
YEAH.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:20.329
I THINK --

01:03:20.396 --> 01:03:21.697
MY OTHER ANSWER TO AN EARLIER

01:03:21.764 --> 01:03:22.732
QUESTION THAT RELATES TO WHAT

01:03:22.798 --> 01:03:23.900
YOU JUST SAID IS.

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:25.134
I WISH THE PUBLIC HAD A GREATER

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:27.837
UNDERSTANDING OF UNCERTAINTY.

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:31.674
AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE GOING

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:33.409
TO NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS TO

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:34.877
PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION.

01:03:34.944 --> 01:03:38.147
EVEN WHEN WE DON'T HAVE A 100%

01:03:38.214 --> 01:03:39.782
CERTAINTY AND THAT IS WHAT'S

01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:42.051
HARD ABOUT THIS HE'S ARE COMPLEX.

01:03:42.118 --> 01:03:43.886
INTER RELATED QUESTIONS WHICH

01:03:43.953 --> 01:03:46.522
MEANS THAT AS A SCIENTIST I HAVE

01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:48.057
TO RECOGNIZE THERE'S A FAIRLY

01:03:48.124 --> 01:03:49.725
LARGE UNCERTAINTY.

01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:50.560
AND SO I THINK ANOTHER WAY TO

01:03:50.626 --> 01:03:52.528
FRAME YOUR CHALLENGES HOW DO YOU

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:54.297
MAKE DECISIONS AND ACT.

01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:55.965
IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY AND I

01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:58.134
THINK THAT IS A IS A COURT

01:03:58.201 --> 01:04:00.036
CHALLENGE WORKING IN THE SPACE

01:04:00.102 --> 01:04:04.640
OF CHEMISTRY --

01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:06.342
CHAU ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY YES

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:07.510
IT'S HARD WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:09.178
ON BOTH SIDES --

01:04:09.245 --> 01:04:11.314
I WILL SAY IN THE CASE OF

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:14.283
VACCINATIONS.

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:15.785
THE THERE IS A SCIENTIFIC

01:04:15.851 --> 01:04:17.186
CONSENSUS.

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:18.421
IN THE CASE OF CLIMATE CHANGE

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:20.690
THERE'S A SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS

01:04:20.756 --> 01:04:22.191
AND THERE'S GOOD REASON FOR THAT.

01:04:22.258 --> 01:04:24.727
AND I THINK YOU YOU NEED TO RELY

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:26.762
UPON THE SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS

01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:27.997
WHEN THERE ISN'T.

01:04:28.064 --> 01:04:29.031
ONE ARE BUT THERE ARE OTHER

01:04:29.098 --> 01:04:29.332
CASES -- WE

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:34.403
WERE P. FAST PER FLOOR NATIVE

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:36.772
OUT KILL OUTDATED SINCE YES AS

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:37.773
YOU SAID.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.711
AND THAT THERE WASN'T.

01:04:41.777 --> 01:04:43.613
THOSE DRUGS AND THERE WASN'T FOR

01:04:43.679 --> 01:04:44.480
OTHERS.

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:46.682
AND THEN IT BECOMES VERY HARD

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:48.417
AND THAT'S WHY WE TRIED TO USE

01:04:48.484 --> 01:04:50.686
THE GAME CHEMISTRY PROCESS. TO

01:04:50.753 --> 01:04:52.421
LOOK AT THIS WHERE WE WEREN'T

01:04:52.488 --> 01:04:54.290
SURE WHETHER OR NOT THOSE

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:55.925
PARTICULAR CHEMICALS WERE BANNED.

01:04:55.992 --> 01:04:56.993
AND I THINK ONE OF THE MOST

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:58.294
IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT THE GREEN

01:04:58.361 --> 01:05:00.496
CHEMISTRY PROCESS IS TO TAKE IT

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:02.131
OUT OF THE POLITICAL.

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:04.400
DISCUSSION AND TRY AND GET IT

01:05:04.467 --> 01:05:06.936
INTO A SCIENTIFIC BASIS.

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:09.605
AND THAT TO ME IS A ONE OF THE

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:12.441
MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT THE

01:05:12.508 --> 01:05:13.809
GAME CHEMISTRY PROCESS.

01:05:13.876 --> 01:05:16.846
ALSO THAT WE DON'T AS A DOCTOR

01:05:16.912 --> 01:05:19.181
MOLLY HILL SAID SIMPLY.

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:20.583
PUT ANOTHER CHEMICAL IN THAT

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:22.251
MIGHT BE JUST AS BAD AND THAT'S

01:05:22.318 --> 01:05:24.053
ANOTHER THING --

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.855
WE MAY NOT THINK ABOUT IT IN THE

01:05:25.921 --> 01:05:28.157
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BUT WITH THE

01:05:28.224 --> 01:05:29.525
GREEN CHEMISTRY PROCESS.

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:32.295
THERE MANDATED TO DO THAT.

01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:34.597
SO THAT'S THE REASON WHY TRUST

01:05:34.664 --> 01:05:39.835
THAT OVER US JUST LEGISLATING --

01:05:39.902 --> 01:05:41.037
MISTER MURATSUCHI THANK YOU

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:43.973
MISTER CHAIRMAN OF HI I WAS

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:44.573
LISTENING TO YOUR TESTIMONY ON

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:49.412
THE THE DAY THAT THE TV THAT TO

01:05:49.478 --> 01:05:51.380
AND SO I APPRECIATE YOUR

01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:53.015
COMMENTS ESPECIALLY AS A A A NEW

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:54.116
PARENT --

01:05:54.183 --> 01:05:55.551
AND AND YOUR COMMENT ABOUT HOW

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:56.819
WHEN YOU BECOME A PARENT YOU

01:05:56.886 --> 01:05:58.387
BECOME AFRAID OF EVERYTHING I

01:05:58.454 --> 01:06:00.056
THINK THAT.

01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:02.091
TO SOMETHING THAT I CAN REALLY

01:06:02.158 --> 01:06:05.728
APPRECIATE I CONSUMERS ABOUT

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:07.563
UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE I THINK.

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:09.231
YOU KNOW --

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:12.568
DID NOT NOT NOT JUST IS IT OF

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:14.603
DID DO CONSUMERS --

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:17.373
MAKE CHOICES BASED ON THE

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.141
INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO THEM

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:20.176
BUT I THINK.

01:06:20.242 --> 01:06:22.912
VOTERS AND POLITICIANS MAKE

01:06:22.978 --> 01:06:24.914
CHOICES BASED ON THE INFORMATION

01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:26.749
AVAILABLE TO THEM AND SO.

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.150
YOU KNOW.

01:06:28.217 --> 01:06:30.486
WHEN THEY'RE?

01:06:30.553 --> 01:06:31.921
WHEN WHEN WHEN SCIENTISTS SAY

01:06:31.987 --> 01:06:32.888
THAT THERE IS A LACK OF

01:06:32.955 --> 01:06:34.590
CONSENSUS ON THE DANGERS OF A

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:35.891
CERTAIN CHEMICAL?

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:37.426
BUT THAT THERE IS OVERWHELMING

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:38.728
PUBLIC PERCEPTION THAT THERE IS

01:06:38.794 --> 01:06:40.730
A DANGER THEN THAT'S WHEN WE

01:06:40.796 --> 01:06:42.064
RESPOND AND THAT'S THE WORLD

01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:43.699
THAT WERE OPERATING IN.

01:06:43.766 --> 01:06:46.469
AND YOU KNOW I I WANT TO BRING

01:06:46.535 --> 01:06:47.737
UP THEY THEY EXAMPLE OF OF

01:06:47.803 --> 01:06:48.637
GLYPHOSATE.

01:06:48.704 --> 01:06:50.373
YOU KNOW WHERE [inaudible]

01:06:50.439 --> 01:06:52.641
WE HAVE.

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:53.809
IN OF THE WORLD HEALTH

01:06:53.876 --> 01:06:55.678
ORGANIZATION IS SAYING THAT IT'S

01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:58.114
A PROBLEM CARCINOGEN AND AND AND

01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.148
WE HAVE.

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:00.649
IT AND AND YET I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:07:00.716 --> 01:07:02.351
THEY THEY THE E. YOU JUST

01:07:02.418 --> 01:07:03.853
EXTENDED THE THE THE THE LEASE

01:07:03.919 --> 01:07:05.988
FOR THE USE OF OF OF CLIVUS

01:07:06.055 --> 01:07:06.622
EIGHT AND YET ON THE OTHER HAND

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:07.490
WE HAVE.

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:08.724
NUMEROUS COUNTRIES THAT HAVE

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:11.227
ALREADY BANNED OR WRIST --

01:07:11.293 --> 01:07:14.029
RESTRICTED THAT THE USE OF OF

01:07:14.096 --> 01:07:15.331
CLIVUS SAY.

01:07:15.398 --> 01:07:16.532
AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW LAST YEAR

01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:18.367
WE WE HAD --

01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:19.001
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE MILLION

01:07:19.068 --> 01:07:21.337
DOLLAR JURY VERDICT --

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:23.406
YOU KNOW WELL CHALLENGING THE

01:07:23.472 --> 01:07:24.840
USE OF OF CLIVUS SATAN SO MY MY

01:07:24.907 --> 01:07:26.409
POINT IS THAT.

01:07:26.475 --> 01:07:27.243
YOU KNOW WHAT WHY WE LIKE TO

01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:28.711
THINK THAT THAT SCIENCE IS THE

01:07:28.778 --> 01:07:30.613
ANSWER TO EVERYTHING I I THINK

01:07:30.679 --> 01:07:32.815
SCIENCE.

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:34.049
YOU NY IS ARE LIKE STATISTICS

01:07:34.116 --> 01:07:36.419
THAT IT CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT

01:07:36.485 --> 01:07:37.720
AND SOMEONE SAID --

01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:39.755
ONE SIDE'S AGENDA OR THE OTHER --

01:07:39.822 --> 01:07:41.690
AND AND SO I I WANT TO HEAR YOUR

01:07:41.757 --> 01:07:43.159
YOUR THOUGHTS IN A WAY WHEN WHEN

01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:44.460
THEY'RE THERE SEEMS TO BE

01:07:44.527 --> 01:07:46.862
COMPETING SCIENTIFIC'S EARNS

01:07:46.929 --> 01:07:47.730
ABOUT.

01:07:47.797 --> 01:07:49.632
ABOUT FTA STUDIES BEING

01:07:49.698 --> 01:07:52.101
UNDERMINED BY INTEREST GROUPS --

01:07:52.168 --> 01:07:53.669
YOU KNOW HOW HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:55.304
TO DEAL WITH THE UNCERTAINTY AND

01:07:55.371 --> 01:07:56.272
SCIENCE ITSELF.

01:07:56.338 --> 01:07:57.473
THERE I I THINK THAT THAT'S AN

01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:59.141
IMPORTANT QUESTION ASKING WHY

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:00.476
YOU NEED.

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:01.877
TEAMS LIKE YOU HAVE A T. T. S.

01:08:01.944 --> 01:08:04.280
C. WHO ARE THE EXPERTS IN

01:08:04.346 --> 01:08:05.915
EVALUATING THE QUALITY OF

01:08:05.981 --> 01:08:07.550
INFORMATION AND STUDIES THAT ARE

01:08:07.616 --> 01:08:08.384
BEING DONE.

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:10.186
AND SO THE WHAT THE WAY I THINK

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:11.520
OF THE QUESTION IN AN ISSUE YOU

01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:12.788
JUST BROUGHT UP IS.

01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:14.957
BASICALLY A HOW MUCH OF AN

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:16.992
INDICATOR EARLY INDICATOR DO YOU

01:08:17.059 --> 01:08:19.462
HAVE NEED TO HAVE OF A POTENTIAL.

01:08:19.528 --> 01:08:22.064
PARTNER RIGHT BECAUSE WHEN WE

01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:25.067
LIVE IN SUCH A COMPLEX SOCIETY.

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:26.335
EXPOSED TO SO MANY DIFFERENT

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:28.604
CHEMICALS IDENTIFYING THAT A

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:30.172
SINGLE BAD ACTOR AT A SINGLE

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:31.841
EXPOSURE.

01:08:31.907 --> 01:08:33.476
IS GOING TO CAUSE A PROBLEM IT'S

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:36.479
KIND OF LIKE SAYING I GOT CANCER

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:38.247
BECAUSE A ONE TWENTY WE DON'T

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:38.848
KNOW THAT BUT IF YOU HAVE A

01:08:38.914 --> 01:08:40.683
HABIT OF EATING TWINKIES AND NOT

01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:42.952
EXERCISING YOUR YOUR LIKELIHOOD

01:08:43.018 --> 01:08:44.620
OF HAVING A HEALTH PROBLEM IS IS.

01:08:44.687 --> 01:08:45.454
HIGHER RIGHT.

01:08:45.521 --> 01:08:47.323
AND SO.

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:50.593
THAT EARLY INDICATOR OF HARM --

01:08:50.659 --> 01:08:51.961
IS THE THRESHOLD THAT YOU'RE

01:08:52.027 --> 01:08:52.928
LOOKING.

01:08:52.995 --> 01:08:55.030
FOR AND SO.

01:08:55.097 --> 01:08:56.765
WHERE YOU CHOOSE TO DRAW THAT

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:58.934
LINE IS A MORAL JUDGMENT NOT A

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:00.269
SCIENTIFIC JUDGMENT AND I THINK

01:09:00.336 --> 01:09:01.937
THIS IS THAT THE ROOT OF WHAT

01:09:02.004 --> 01:09:03.239
YOU'RE DRIVING AT?

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:06.175
IS HOW MUCH CONSENSUS DO YOU

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:07.743
NEED DO NEED CONSENSUS THAT THIS

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:08.911
HAS.

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:10.279
THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES THAT ARE

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:11.547
SIMILAR TO THINGS THAT ARE KNOWN

01:09:11.614 --> 01:09:13.082
TO HAVE THESE EFFECTS DO YOU

01:09:13.148 --> 01:09:14.316
NEED TO KNOW THOSE EFFECTS IN

01:09:14.383 --> 01:09:17.453
PEOPLE DO YOU NEED TO JUST HAVE

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:17.920
SAY THAT --

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:19.755
WELL COMPUTER MODEL SAID THAT

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:20.322
THEY SHOULD HAVE A SIMILAR

01:09:20.389 --> 01:09:22.124
EFFECT THOSE ARE ALL REASONABLE

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:24.293
PLACES TO DRAW THE LINE TO SAY

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:27.296
THIS IS A POTENTIAL CARCINOGEN

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:31.901
DON'T AYE ARC THAT HAS THEIR SET.

01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:33.836
OF REQUIREMENTS AND IT'S

01:09:33.903 --> 01:09:35.538
IMPORTANT I THINK PEOPLE MISS

01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:36.605
THIS ALL THE TIME IT'S NOT THAT

01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:38.440
SCIENCE CAN BE USED ONE WAY OR

01:09:38.507 --> 01:09:39.675
THE OTHER ON SCIENCE CAN BE

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:41.544
INTERPRETED IN ONE WAY OR

01:09:41.610 --> 01:09:42.344
ANOTHER.

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:44.980
ALL OF THOSE THRESHOLDS ARE

01:09:45.047 --> 01:09:47.182
REASONABLE THRESHOLDS.

01:09:47.249 --> 01:09:49.718
AND THE DATA UNDERLYING IT.

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:52.454
SHOULD BE OBJECTIVE BUT WHERE TO

01:09:52.521 --> 01:09:53.756
DRAW THAT LINE IS A MORAL

01:09:53.822 --> 01:09:56.192
JUDGMENT AND IT'S NOT AN EASY.

01:09:56.258 --> 01:09:57.459
ONE AND THAT IS WHAT WE FOR YOU

01:09:57.526 --> 01:09:58.661
KNOW PUT YOU GUYS IN OFFICE TO

01:09:58.727 --> 01:10:00.596
DO IS MAKE THOSE MORAL JUDGMENTS

01:10:00.663 --> 01:10:03.866
WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE --

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:07.536
AND WE AGREE WITH YOU WE VOTE

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:12.474
YOU AND WE WE DON'T WE WATCH OUR

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:14.577
THANK YOU.

01:10:14.643 --> 01:10:16.478
THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT ANSWER --

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:18.447
JUST TO TALK ABOUT THE LIFE IS

01:10:18.514 --> 01:10:21.083
STATE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE TOPICS

01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:22.618
AS A SCIENTIST AND THERE IS A

01:10:22.685 --> 01:10:24.386
CONSIGNA THE CONSENSUS IT'S NOT

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:26.322
A PROBLEM BUT YOU DO HAVE ONE

01:10:26.388 --> 01:10:27.923
GROUP SAYING IT IS.

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:29.458
ACTUALLY OTHER GROUPS WITHIN THE

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:32.628
WHL WORLD HEALTH IT SAYS IT'S

01:10:32.695 --> 01:10:34.263
NOT A PROBLEM --

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:35.998
IT'S JUST ONE AGENCY BUT THE WAY

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:38.100
PROP SIXTY FIVE WORKS TO GETS

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:40.035
LABELED WHETHER OR NOT --

01:10:40.102 --> 01:10:41.870
ANYONE BELIEVES IT REALLY IS A

01:10:41.937 --> 01:10:44.273
PROBLEM IT'S JUST THIS WAS THE

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:45.908
WAY THEY INITIATIVE WAS WRITTEN.

01:10:45.975 --> 01:10:47.743
IT GETS LABELED THE NICE THING

01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:49.945
ABOUT GREEN CHEMISTRY AS IT LETS

01:10:50.012 --> 01:10:52.581
YOU USE --

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:55.851
THE EXISTING EXPERTISE.

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:58.220
AND MAKE A DECISION AS OPPOSED

01:10:58.287 --> 01:11:00.289
TO JUST ARBITRARILY DECIDING

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:01.523
WE'RE GOING TO PUT A LOT LABEL

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:03.826
ON THIS BECAUSE ONE AGENCY OUT

01:11:03.892 --> 01:11:06.128
OF DOZENS HAS DECIDED IT'S

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:07.896
PROBLEM --

01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:12.167
OTHER QUESTIONS --

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:13.002
IN [inaudible]

01:11:13.068 --> 01:11:15.437
LET'S SEE.

01:11:15.504 --> 01:11:17.172
I'M JUST GONNA MAKE A COMMENT

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:19.642
WHICH IS THAT.

01:11:19.708 --> 01:11:21.977
THE CHEMICAL RESIDENT REVOLUTION

01:11:22.044 --> 01:11:23.846
ARE AND FOR THAT MATTER THE

01:11:23.912 --> 01:11:25.681
COMPUTER REVOLUTION WHICH HAS

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:27.316
ALLOWED US.

01:11:27.383 --> 01:11:29.885
TO EVALUATE CHEMICALS --

01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:34.356
HAS BROUGHT MANY MANY BENEFITS

01:11:34.423 --> 01:11:36.558
TO ASSAULT WE'RE LIVING LONGER.

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:38.394
FOR THE MOST PART ALTHOUGH THERE

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:41.030
ARE SOME AREAS WHERE.

01:11:41.096 --> 01:11:42.264
IN THIS IN THIS PART OF THE

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:43.666
COUNTRY IN OTHER PARTS OF THE

01:11:43.732 --> 01:11:45.167
COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIVING

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:47.336
LONGER BUT BY AND LARGE --

01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:48.637
WE'RE LIVING LONGER AND IT'S

01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:50.606
BECAUSE OF THE CHEMISTRY IT'S

01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:53.475
BECAUSE OF THE BREAKTHROUGHS

01:11:53.542 --> 01:11:54.643
THAT ARE BEING MADE IN VARIOUS

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:57.446
TECHNOLOGY SO IN NET IT'S

01:11:57.513 --> 01:11:58.981
DEFINITELY A GOOD THING --

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:00.582
BUT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:02.551
WHAT WE'RE DOING DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:04.420
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON THAT IN

01:12:04.486 --> 01:12:07.623
TERMS OF NOT ONLY HOW TO FIX OUR

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:10.893
HEALTH BUT OUR ECONOMY --

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:12.528
DR MOTHER HIM.

01:12:12.594 --> 01:12:14.196
ABSOLUTELY HAVE LOTS OF THOUGHTS

01:12:14.263 --> 01:12:16.331
ABOUT CHEMISTRY BUT WHAT I WOULD

01:12:16.398 --> 01:12:19.468
SAY TO IS THAT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:20.202
RIGHT.

01:12:20.269 --> 01:12:22.371
THAT CHEMISTRY AND MATERIALS

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:24.073
BRING US A LOT OF BENEFITS.

01:12:24.139 --> 01:12:24.973
I THINK.

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.076
WHAT WE'RE LEARNING AND WHAT

01:12:27.142 --> 01:12:27.843
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN SHIFTING

01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:29.878
TOWARDS A SAFER CHEMISTRY SO WE

01:12:29.945 --> 01:12:31.447
USED TO HAVE?

01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:32.481
ISSUES OF ENVIRONMENTAL

01:12:32.548 --> 01:12:33.649
POLLUTION THAT WERE EVEN WORSE

01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:34.650
AND DIFFERENT THAN THE ONES WE

01:12:34.717 --> 01:12:35.718
HAVE TODAY WE'RE CONSTANTLY

01:12:35.784 --> 01:12:37.853
MOVING THE LINE IN THE RIGHT

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.155
DIRECTION.

01:12:40.222 --> 01:12:41.890
AND OUR JOB ISN'T.

01:12:41.957 --> 01:12:43.959
TO YOU KNOW RETRY ISSUES OF THE

01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:45.961
PAST IT'S TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:47.763
WE MOVE THAT LINE.

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:49.865
IN THE FUTURE TOWARDS SOMETHING

01:12:49.932 --> 01:12:51.567
THAT IS AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE AS

01:12:51.633 --> 01:12:53.235
BENEFICIAL AS POSSIBLE AND I

01:12:53.302 --> 01:12:54.503
THINK THAT IS THE CHALLENGE

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:55.771
THAT'S BEFORE US.

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:58.073
RATHER THAN THAN RETRYING ANY

01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:00.142
PARTICULAR ISSUE WHAT I WOULD

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:02.311
SAY IS WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

01:13:02.377 --> 01:13:04.480
NOW WITH --

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:06.148
GREATER RESOURCE IS TO THINK

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:07.883
ABOUT INSTEAD OF JUST USING ALL

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:08.984
THE WASTE PRODUCTS FROM THE

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:10.385
PETROLEUM INDUSTRY TO MAKE OUR

01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:11.820
MATERIALS WHICH IS WHAT WE DO

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:14.523
ABOUT. 98% OF CHEMICALS ARE BY

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:15.724
PRODUCTS THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY

01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:18.060
WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE IF WE

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:20.229
STARTED WITH DIFFERENT SOURCES --

01:13:20.295 --> 01:13:22.030
WHAT IF WE STARTED WITH CROPS OR

01:13:22.097 --> 01:13:25.200
WASTE AND RE OPTIMIZE FOR BOTH

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:26.902
HEALTH AND FUNCTION AND

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:28.804
PERFORMANCE --

01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:29.872
SO I GUESS THE THE COMMENT I

01:13:29.938 --> 01:13:30.506
WOULD.

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:31.874
INDY WITH IS DON'T THINK OF

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:33.675
CHEMISTRY IS SEPARATE FROM THE

01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:35.310
OTHER ISSUES YOU THINK ABOUT

01:13:35.377 --> 01:13:37.446
LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE LIKE

01:13:37.513 --> 01:13:39.348
RESOURCE USE --

01:13:39.414 --> 01:13:42.284
BECAUSE REALLY MAKE EVERYTHING

01:13:42.351 --> 01:13:44.987
OUT OF ARE AT THE CORE OF A LOT

01:13:45.053 --> 01:13:46.855
OF THESE IMPACTS --

01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:49.458
SO I'D LIKE TO SOMETIMES A JOKE

01:13:49.525 --> 01:13:50.959
THAT WERE STUCK IN BETWEEN

01:13:51.026 --> 01:13:52.227
CANCER CLIMATE CHANGE THE NO ONE

01:13:52.294 --> 01:13:54.897
WANTS TO TALK ABOUT.

01:13:54.963 --> 01:13:55.564
CHEMISTRY --

01:13:55.631 --> 01:13:57.833
ON A GOOD DAY I ACTUALLY THINK

01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.835
THAT WE ARE THE CONNECTION

01:13:59.902 --> 01:14:01.003
BETWEEN CANCER AND CLIMATE

01:14:01.069 --> 01:14:02.237
CHANGE SO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO

01:14:02.304 --> 01:14:04.306
MAKE AN IMPACT.

01:14:04.373 --> 01:14:05.674
FOCUS ON CHEMISTRY.

CONSUMERS ARE DEMANDING CHANGE

01:16:17.539 --> 01:16:19.007
AND COMPANIES ARE RESPONDING.

01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:19.841
IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:21.843
CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO REDUCE

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:24.846
TOXICS IN PRODUCTS MAY BE THE

01:16:24.913 --> 01:16:26.715
MOST SIGNIFICANT OF ANY STATES.

01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:28.317
TEN YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE

01:16:28.383 --> 01:16:30.953

THIS STATEMENT.

01:16:32.454 --> 01:16:34.156
WHAT IS NEEDED IS NOTHING SHORT

01:16:34.222 --> 01:16:36.224
OF A COMPLETE OVERHAUL OF

01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:37.960
CURRENT TOXICS POLICY?

01:16:38.026 --> 01:16:39.628
REPLACING IN EFFECT INEFFECTIVE

01:16:39.695 --> 01:16:41.797
LAWS WITH POLICIES THAT RELIEVE

01:16:41.863 --> 01:16:43.765
THE PUBLIC'S BURDEN TO PROVE

01:16:43.832 --> 01:16:46.134
HARM AFTER THE FACT AND SHIFTED

01:16:46.201 --> 01:16:48.203
ON TO THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY. TO

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:51.974
DEMONSTRATE LACK OF HARM BEFORE.

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:54.076
DESPITE THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE

01:16:54.142 --> 01:16:55.377
PROTECTING CONSUMERS IS AS

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.713
URGENT AS EVER.

01:16:57.779 --> 01:16:59.481
JUST SUNDAY NEW YORK TIMES

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:01.650
ARTICLE LAMENTED THE PRESENCE OF

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:03.685
TALL EWING LED AS BEST AS

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:05.654
PARABENS AND PHTHALATES IN

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:07.356
COSMETICS.

01:17:07.422 --> 01:17:08.757
FORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA'S

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:10.492
LEGISLATURE WRECKED RECOGNIZE

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:12.627
THIS THE SHORTFALLS OF CHEMICALS

01:17:12.694 --> 01:17:14.162
MANAGEMENT AND PUSHED

01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:15.063
LEGISLATION TO TACKLE THE

01:17:15.130 --> 01:17:18.133
CHALLENGE.

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:19.668
THE GREEN CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE

01:17:19.735 --> 01:17:23.171
SB FIVE OH NINE EIGHT FEET ABC

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:23.772
EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE AND THE

01:17:23.839 --> 01:17:24.773
SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:27.442
REGULATIONS ALL RECOGNIZE THE

01:17:27.509 --> 01:17:29.411
SCALE OF THE SEA CHANGE.

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:31.646
THAT WAS NEEDED UNFORTUNATELY

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:33.248
THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WERE

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:35.317
CRAFTED TO BE AMBITIOUS ENOUGH

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:37.619
TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS.

01:17:37.686 --> 01:17:38.854
AND REALIZE THE BENEFITS.

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:41.456
THE GREEN CHEMIST OF THE GREEN

01:17:41.523 --> 01:17:42.591
CHEMISTRY OPPORTUNITY.

01:17:42.657 --> 01:17:44.393
MY COMMENTS TODAY WILL FOCUS ON

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:46.395
OUR WORK IMPLEMENTING THE SAFER

01:17:46.461 --> 01:17:47.929
CONSUMER PRODUCTS REGULATIONS.

01:17:47.996 --> 01:17:49.164
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

01:17:49.231 --> 01:17:52.067
THAT THEY ARE ONLY ONE FACET.

01:17:52.134 --> 01:17:54.269
OF WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO GET YOU

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:56.338
A GREEN CHEMISTRY BASED ECONOMY

01:17:56.405 --> 01:17:58.673
IN CALIFORNIA.

01:17:58.740 --> 01:17:59.908
IN THE TEN YEARS SINCE THE LAW

01:17:59.975 --> 01:18:01.543
PASSED WE'VE BEEN DOING WHAT THE

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:03.311
LEGISLATOR AT LEGISLATURE ASKED

01:18:03.378 --> 01:18:04.346
US TO DO.

01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:05.714
FIRST WE UNDERTOOK THE

01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:08.216
DEVELOPMENT OF REGULATIONS THAT

01:18:08.283 --> 01:18:10.452
WOULD SHIFT THE PARADIGM FOR

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:12.087
MANAGEMENT OF TOXIC CHEMICALS.

01:18:12.154 --> 01:18:13.321
THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:18:13.388 --> 01:18:15.123
ENGAGEMENT ACROSS THE

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:16.758
STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY DURING THE

01:18:16.825 --> 01:18:18.493
REGULATIONS DEVELOPMENT.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.295
AND THAT'S STILL A SIGNATURE OF

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:21.563
THE PROGRAM.

01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:23.331
AS EVIDENCED BY A BROAD SPECTRUM

01:18:23.398 --> 01:18:25.133
OF SPEAKERS TODAY AND THOSE IN

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.102
ATTENDANCE.

01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:28.970
WE ADOPTED REGULATIONS INTENDED

01:18:29.037 --> 01:18:30.806
TO MOVE AWAY FROM REACTIVE

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:32.941
CHEMICAL WHACK A MOLE APPROACH

01:18:33.008 --> 01:18:35.877
TOWARDS SCIENCE BASED DECISIONS.

01:18:35.944 --> 01:18:37.913
THAT ARE COMPREHENSIVE IDENTIFY

01:18:37.979 --> 01:18:39.848
SAFER ALTERNATIVES AND AVOID

01:18:39.915 --> 01:18:42.417
SHIPS REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTES.

01:18:42.484 --> 01:18:43.518
THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS

01:18:43.585 --> 01:18:45.654
REGULATIONS HOLD MANUFACTURERS

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:48.056
ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THE SAFETY OF

01:18:48.123 --> 01:18:49.491
THEIR PRODUCTS BY COMPELLING

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:51.860
INDUSTRY TO OFFER SAFER PRODUCTS

01:18:51.927 --> 01:18:53.128
TO CONSUMERS.

01:18:53.195 --> 01:18:55.730
IMPORTANTLY ADOPTING THE

01:18:55.797 --> 01:18:57.732
FORCIBLE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

01:18:57.799 --> 01:19:00.402
PROVIDES MORE MARKET CERTAINTY.

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:02.237
AN IN AND PROVIDES INCENTIVES

01:19:02.304 --> 01:19:06.108
FOR CHANGE.

01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:07.509
CALIFORNIA IS BLESSED WITH

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:09.744
COMPANIES WHO ARE COMMITTED TO A

01:19:09.811 --> 01:19:11.913
SAFER PRODUCTS METHOD HEWLETT

01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:14.616
PACKARD LEVI APPLE BEAUTY

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:16.551
COUNTER AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES

01:19:16.618 --> 01:19:17.953
COMPANIES.

01:19:18.019 --> 01:19:19.254
ARE ALREADY AGGRESSIVELY

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:21.056
ELIMINATING TOXIC CHEMICALS IN

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:22.524
THEIR PRODUCTS YOU'LL HEAR FROM

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:24.860
REPRESENTATIVES OF SOME OF THOSE

01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:26.895
COMPANIES TODAY.

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:28.263
AND I THINK THEY'LL THEY'LL GIVE

01:19:28.330 --> 01:19:29.931
YOU A PERSPECTIVE OF HOW THEY

01:19:29.998 --> 01:19:31.700
ARE TACKLING THIS PROBLEM.

01:19:31.766 --> 01:19:34.269
THE SEP RAPPER REGULATIONS HELP

01:19:34.336 --> 01:19:36.071
SET A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD SO

01:19:36.138 --> 01:19:37.739
THAT THOSE TYPES OF COMPANIES

01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:39.407
THAT MOVE FORWARD.

01:19:39.474 --> 01:19:40.842
TOWARD SAFER ALTERNATIVES.

01:19:40.909 --> 01:19:42.811
ARE AT A DISADVANTAGE IN THE

01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:44.279
MARKET PLACE.

01:19:44.346 --> 01:19:45.247
THESE OUTCOMES WARRANTED SHIVA

01:19:45.313 --> 01:19:47.449
BOWL WITH THE HISTORICAL

01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:48.984
VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS.

01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:51.520
SUCH AS THE POLLUTION PREVENTION

01:19:51.586 --> 01:19:52.854
PROGRAM AT THE TSC.

01:19:52.921 --> 01:19:55.357
WE'VE BUILT THE PROGRAM ON THREE

01:19:55.423 --> 01:19:57.359
FUNDAMENTAL PILLARS. TO BUILD

01:19:57.425 --> 01:20:00.295
CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT THE RIGS.

01:20:00.362 --> 01:20:01.563
TO EXECUTE.

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:04.065
AND TO LEAD.

01:20:04.132 --> 01:20:05.667
SO BY CAPACITY BUILDING WILL I

01:20:05.734 --> 01:20:07.802
MEAN WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT WE

01:20:07.869 --> 01:20:10.071
HAVE THE SKILLS THE PROCESSES

01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:13.008
AND THE SCIENTIFIC RESOURCES. TO

01:20:13.074 --> 01:20:14.643
IMPLEMENT THIS UNIQUE SET OF

01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:16.211
REGULATIONS.

01:20:16.278 --> 01:20:18.246
WE'VE HIRED STAFF WITH NEW AREAS

01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:20.415
OF EXPERTISE THAT ARE NEEDED TO

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:21.583
SUPPORT.

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:24.352
OUR WORK WE DEVELOPED PROCESSES

01:20:24.419 --> 01:20:26.087
TO SUPPORT OUR DECISIONS AND

01:20:26.154 --> 01:20:27.822
REGULATORY ACTIONS.

01:20:27.889 --> 01:20:29.257
AND WE'VE ENSURED THAT OUR STAFF

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:31.092
HAVE ACCESS TO THE RIGHT TOOLS

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:32.827

01:20:32.894 --> 01:20:34.496
DATA.

01:20:34.563 --> 01:20:35.497
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO PRESS

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:37.966
PRESIDENT FOR APPROACH WE BUILT

01:20:38.033 --> 01:20:40.235
MANY OF OUR TOOLS FROM SCRATCH.

01:20:40.302 --> 01:20:43.138
AND PROCEDURES THE SAME WAY.

01:20:43.205 --> 01:20:45.073
BUT WE LOOK WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.575
FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO USE

01:20:46.641 --> 01:20:48.743
EXISTING RESOURCES AND ADAPT TO

01:20:48.810 --> 01:20:49.244

PROTECT WORKERS AND CHILDREN.

01:26:58.012 --> 01:26:59.814
IN OUR WORK PLAN EMPHASIZES THE

01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:01.983
IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING THE

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:04.786
MOST VULNERABLE VULNERABLE.

01:27:04.852 --> 01:27:06.921
THIS HEARING WAS PROMPTED BY THE

01:27:06.988 --> 01:27:07.789
RELEASE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:27:07.855 --> 01:27:09.624
INSTITUTE REPORT AND TAKING

01:27:09.691 --> 01:27:11.826
STOCK OF CALIFORNIA'S APPROACH

01:27:11.893 --> 01:27:14.062
TO GAME GREEN CHEMISTRY.

01:27:14.128 --> 01:27:15.964
GIVEN THE LACK OF ACTION AND

01:27:16.030 --> 01:27:17.231
LEADERSHIP AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

01:27:17.298 --> 01:27:19.000
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT CALIFORNIA

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:20.768
CONTINUE TO BE OUT FRONT ON

01:27:20.835 --> 01:27:22.203
TOXICS.

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:24.639
WE HAVE REVIEWED THE REPORT AND

01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:26.441
USED IT TO REFLECT ON OUR WORK.

01:27:26.507 --> 01:27:27.775
MANY OF THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE

01:27:27.842 --> 01:27:30.578
REPORT ARE SPOT ON WE AGREE THAT

01:27:30.645 --> 01:27:31.813
IT'S TIME TO REVISIT.

01:27:31.879 --> 01:27:33.247
THE OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE

01:27:33.314 --> 01:27:36.851
INITIATIVE. FOR INSTANCE WE'VE

01:27:36.918 --> 01:27:38.219
HIRED AS DR MOBILE HOME

01:27:38.286 --> 01:27:40.121
MENTIONED OUTSTANDING GRADUATES

01:27:40.188 --> 01:27:41.756
FROM UC BERKELEY'S GREENER KEPT

01:27:41.823 --> 01:27:43.257
GREENER SOLUTIONS PROGRAM.

01:27:43.324 --> 01:27:44.626
BUT WE NEED UNIVERSITIES TO

01:27:44.692 --> 01:27:46.327
EDUCATE MORE STUDENTS AND MORE

01:27:46.394 --> 01:27:48.763
DISCIPLINES IN THE CONCEPTS OF

01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:50.598
TRUE SUSTAINABILITY IN GREEN

01:27:50.665 --> 01:27:51.666
CHEMISTRY.

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:53.468
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE TOXIC

01:27:53.534 --> 01:27:54.736
INFORMATION CLEARING HOUSE IS

01:27:54.802 --> 01:27:56.971
NOT SERVED ITS INTENDED PURPOSE.

01:27:57.038 --> 01:27:57.972
AND THAT THERE ARE BETTER MORE

01:27:58.039 --> 01:28:01.509
USEFUL TOOLS AVAILABLE TODAY.

01:28:01.576 --> 01:28:03.277
AND WE KNOW THE DTS HE'S

01:28:03.344 --> 01:28:04.579
POLLUTION PREVENTION PROGRAM

01:28:04.646 --> 01:28:07.448
OFFERS SOLUTIONS TO MANY.

01:28:07.515 --> 01:28:09.217
MANY INTRACTABLE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:28:09.283 --> 01:28:10.985
PROBLEMS.

01:28:11.052 --> 01:28:12.820
RE COMMITTING TO THAT WORK WOULD

01:28:12.887 --> 01:28:13.855
BENEFIT THE STATE.

01:28:13.921 --> 01:28:14.756
ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE

01:28:14.822 --> 01:28:20.795
COMMUNITIES.

01:28:20.862 --> 01:28:21.929
THE REPORTS DISCUSSION OF OUR

01:28:21.996 --> 01:28:23.297
DATA CHALLENGES ECHO THE

01:28:23.364 --> 01:28:25.233
ORIGINAL LEGISLATIVE REPORT

01:28:25.299 --> 01:28:26.768
OUTLINING A DATA GAP THE

01:28:26.834 --> 01:28:27.769
PREVENTS GOVERNMENT FROM

01:28:27.835 --> 01:28:29.937
ADEQUATELY PROTECTING PEOPLE

01:28:30.004 --> 01:28:31.472
FROM HARMFUL CHEMICALS.

01:28:31.539 --> 01:28:33.408
IT WOULD BE TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL

01:28:33.474 --> 01:28:35.743
FOR US TO HAVE ACCESS. TO MANY

01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:38.613
TYPES OF DATA INGREDIENT

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:41.049
DISCLOSURE AS THROUGH.

01:28:41.115 --> 01:28:44.352
MORE EXPOSURE STUDIES OR THROUGH

01:28:44.419 --> 01:28:45.853
STRENGTHENING OUR DATA CALL IN

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.188
AUTHORITY.

01:28:47.255 --> 01:28:48.356
WE WILL BENEFIT FROM THE

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:51.993
TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVES LIKE SB.

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:52.994
TWO TO FIFTY EIGHT THE CLEANING

PRODUCTS RIGHT TO KNOW ACT.

01:28:54.962 --> 01:28:55.963
WE BELIEVE THAT DATA FROM THE

01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:57.632
CALIFORNIA BY A MONITORING

01:28:57.699 --> 01:28:59.701
PROGRAM NOT ONLY CAN INFORM OUR

PROVIDE OUR PRIORITIZATION WORK.

01:29:02.203 --> 01:29:03.671
BUT COULD POTENTIALLY PROVIDE

01:29:03.738 --> 01:29:05.673
INFORMATION ABOUT THE EFFICACY

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:07.008
OF OUR ACTIONS.

01:29:07.075 --> 01:29:08.810
BIO MONITORING FUNDING HAS BEEN

01:29:08.876 --> 01:29:12.013
PRECARIOUS AND INADEQUATE.

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.147
WE WILL FOLLOW THE REPORT'S

01:29:13.214 --> 01:29:14.949
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE GREEN

01:29:15.016 --> 01:29:16.184
CHEMISTRY THE GREEN RIBBON

01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:17.118
SCIENCE PANEL DO A

PRIORITIZATION LOOK BACK TO SEE

01:29:19.353 --> 01:29:21.122
IF THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:23.224
THE DEPARTMENT. TO STRENGTHEN

01:29:23.291 --> 01:29:24.826
OUR PRIORITIZATION APPROACH OR

01:29:24.892 --> 01:29:26.360
IMPROVE THE PRESS THE PACE OF

01:29:26.427 --> 01:29:29.163
THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS.

01:29:29.230 --> 01:29:30.732
WE ARE ALREADY PREPARING

01:29:30.798 --> 01:29:32.166
MATERIALS ON THIS TOPIC AND IT

01:29:32.233 --> 01:29:34.635
WILL BE THE FOCUS OF OUR SECOND

01:29:34.702 --> 01:29:36.370
OUR OUR GREEN RIBBON SIGNS PANEL

01:29:36.437 --> 01:29:39.073
SECOND MEETING LATER THIS YEAR.

01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:40.508
SOME OF THE OTHER

01:29:40.575 --> 01:29:41.943
RECOMMENDATIONS NEED IN ME

01:29:42.009 --> 01:29:44.846
DEEPER ANALYSIS OR NEED MORE

01:29:44.912 --> 01:29:46.781
INFORMATION BEFORE PURSUING. FOR

01:29:46.848 --> 01:29:48.149
INSTANCE WE HAVEN'T YET RECEIVED

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:50.251
HER FIRST ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS

01:29:50.318 --> 01:29:52.754
ANALYSES SO IT MAY BE PREMATURE

01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:53.988
TO TINKER WITH THAT PART OF THE

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:55.156
FRAMEWORK.

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:57.325
DTS SEE HAS ALREADY PROVIDED

01:29:57.391 --> 01:29:59.727
GUIDANCE SINCE AND WE STAND

01:29:59.794 --> 01:30:01.929
READY TO SUPPORT. TO PROVIDE

01:30:01.996 --> 01:30:03.498
ASSISTANCE TO THE REGULATED

01:30:03.564 --> 01:30:05.533
COMMUNITY AS THEY GO THROUGH THE

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.502
PROCESS AND WILL CONTINUE TO

01:30:07.568 --> 01:30:09.971
EXAMINE OTHER OPTIONS TO EXIT

01:30:10.037 --> 01:30:11.172
OUT EXPEDITE THE ALTERNATIVES

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:13.040
ANALYSIS PROCESS BY WORKING WITH

01:30:13.107 --> 01:30:14.108
COMPANIES.

01:30:14.175 --> 01:30:16.644
WHO ARE BEGINNING TO CONDUCT THE

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:18.946
ALTERNATIVES ANALYSES?

01:30:19.013 --> 01:30:20.448
I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T

01:30:20.515 --> 01:30:22.183
ADDRESS THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:23.785
PACE OF OUR WORK.

01:30:23.851 --> 01:30:25.186
THERE ARE MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:26.320
CONTRIBUTE TO THAT AND SUMMER

01:30:26.387 --> 01:30:28.923
INHERENT TO THE FRAMEWORK WHICH

01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:30.358
ALTHOUGH PRECAUTIONARY IN

01:30:30.424 --> 01:30:32.059
NATURE'S STILL.

01:30:32.126 --> 01:30:34.829
CALLS FOR ROBUST SCIENCE.

01:30:34.896 --> 01:30:36.397
THERE ARE INHERENT TENSIONS

01:30:36.464 --> 01:30:37.965
BETWEEN SCIENCE BASED IN WELL

01:30:38.032 --> 01:30:40.101
SUPPORTED DECISIONS AND QUICK

01:30:40.168 --> 01:30:41.636
IDENTIFIES SHOULD IDENTIFICATION

01:30:41.702 --> 01:30:42.970
OF PRODUCTS.

01:30:43.037 --> 01:30:45.339
BETWEEN FAST ACTION TO LIMIT A

01:30:45.406 --> 01:30:48.676
CHEMICAL AND THOROUGH ANALYSES

01:30:48.743 --> 01:30:50.244
TO LIMIT REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTES.

01:30:50.311 --> 01:30:52.113
AND BETWEEN PROVIDING A FULL

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:53.214
OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC

01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:54.715
ENGAGEMENT.

01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:56.818
AND MOVING FAST WE'VE BEEN VERY

01:30:56.884 --> 01:30:58.286
COMMITTED TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS

01:30:58.352 --> 01:31:00.121
AND HAD ITERATIVE ENGAGEMENT FOR

01:31:00.188 --> 01:31:02.857
EVERY SIGNIFICANT DECISION THE

01:31:02.924 --> 01:31:03.658
PROGRAM HAS MADE.

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:04.425
AND THIS LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT

01:31:04.492 --> 01:31:07.228
TAKES TIME.

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:08.830
THE NEWNESS AND NOVELTY OF THE

01:31:08.896 --> 01:31:10.097
APPROACH IS ANOTHER REASON THAT

01:31:10.164 --> 01:31:11.265
THE RATE AT WHICH WE'VE

01:31:11.332 --> 01:31:12.834
IMPLEMENTED THE REGULATIONS HAS

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:13.935
BEEN SLOWER.

01:31:14.001 --> 01:31:15.269
THAN MANY STAKEHOLDERS WOULD

01:31:15.336 --> 01:31:16.437
HAVE LIKED.

01:31:16.504 --> 01:31:18.406
AND FIRST IN SOME CASES THEN WE

01:31:18.472 --> 01:31:19.574
WOULD HAVE LIKED --

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:20.174
FOR THE FIRST SEVERAL YEARS OF

01:31:20.241 --> 01:31:24.378
THE EVERY SINGLE THING WE DID

01:31:24.445 --> 01:31:24.946
WAS BEING DONE FOR THE FIRST

01:31:25.012 --> 01:31:26.047
TIME.

01:31:26.113 --> 01:31:27.381
SOME MORE HIGHLY SKEPTICAL THAT

01:31:27.448 --> 01:31:28.449
WE COULD DO DO SOME OF THE

01:31:28.516 --> 01:31:30.718
THINGS THAT WERE ASKED FOR SOME

01:31:30.785 --> 01:31:32.053
AND WHATEVER GREEN RIBBON SIGNS

01:31:32.119 --> 01:31:33.521
PANEL MEMBERS FOR INSTANCE SAID

01:31:33.588 --> 01:31:35.289
WE HE HONESTLY DIDN'T THINK WE

01:31:35.356 --> 01:31:36.591
WOULD BE ABLE TO DEVELOP

01:31:36.657 --> 01:31:38.960
ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS GUIDANCE.

01:31:39.026 --> 01:31:40.127
BUT HE'S SINCE BECOME THAT

01:31:40.194 --> 01:31:41.996
CONVINCED THAT NOT ONLY COULD WE

01:31:42.063 --> 01:31:44.131
DEVELOP THAT GARDENS.

01:31:44.198 --> 01:31:45.967
BUT WE DID IT WELL.

01:31:46.033 --> 01:31:47.635
WE STRUCTURE THE PROGRAM TO BE A

01:31:47.702 --> 01:31:49.570
LEARNING ORGANIZATION WE APPLY

01:31:49.637 --> 01:31:50.938
WHAT WE LEARNED FROM OUR

01:31:51.005 --> 01:31:53.608
SUCCESSES AND OUR MISSTEPS. TO

01:31:53.674 --> 01:31:55.309
BE MORE EFFICIENT I'M CONFIDENT

01:31:55.376 --> 01:31:56.911
THAT THIS WILL BE APPARENT IN

01:31:56.978 --> 01:31:58.446
THE PACE OF AND QUALITY OF THE

01:31:58.512 --> 01:32:00.481
WORK THIS YEAR AND FURTHER INTO

01:32:00.548 --> 01:32:02.216
THE FUTURE.

01:32:02.283 --> 01:32:03.951
BUT AS THE REPORT POINTS OUT ONE

01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:05.286
OF OUR BIGGEST CONSTRAINTS IS

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:07.054
RESOURCES.

01:32:07.121 --> 01:32:08.489
ASI MENTIONED WE'VE HAD SEVERAL

01:32:08.556 --> 01:32:09.523
SUCCESSFUL BUDGET CHANGE

01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:10.958
PROPOSALS.

01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:12.293
AND THE PROGRAM HAS USED THE

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.527
RESOURCES IT'S BEEN GIVEN THROW

01:32:13.594 --> 01:32:15.763
THOSE PROPOSALS AS EFFECTIVELY

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:17.531
AS POSSIBLE.

01:32:17.598 --> 01:32:18.900
MORE RESEARCH IS WOULD ALLOW THE

01:32:18.966 --> 01:32:21.168
PROGRAM TO DO EVEN MORE AS IT

01:32:21.235 --> 01:32:22.603
MOVES FOR WITH IMPLEMENTATION.

01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:24.538
UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT LEVEL

01:32:24.605 --> 01:32:25.706
OF RESOURCES WILL NOT BE

01:32:25.773 --> 01:32:27.275
SUFFICIENT FOR THE PROGRAM TO

01:32:27.341 --> 01:32:28.776
HAVE THE IMPACT IT COULD AND

01:32:28.843 --> 01:32:30.678
SHOULD ON PER TO FIND CONSUMER

01:32:30.745 --> 01:32:32.713
PROTECTION.

01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:34.015
OF COURSE WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT

01:32:34.081 --> 01:32:36.217
THE NEED FIRST SEP RESOURCES

01:32:36.284 --> 01:32:38.119
OUTSIDE OF A DISCUSSION OF THE

01:32:38.185 --> 01:32:39.921
LARGER PRESSURE ON DTS SEES

01:32:39.987 --> 01:32:41.222

01:32:41.289 --> 01:32:42.924
DGSE NEED SUPPORT ACROSS THE

01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:45.092
BOARD TO ADDRESS ITS REVENUE

01:32:45.159 --> 01:32:45.993
SHORTFALLS.

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.962

01:32:51.565 --> 01:32:52.233

DEFICIT.

01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:55.703
IT'S BEEN TWENTY YEARS SINCE THE

01:32:55.770 --> 01:32:57.638
DEPARTMENTS FEES WERE RESET.

01:32:57.705 --> 01:32:59.540
BEYOND TOSCA THE LEGISLATURE

01:32:59.607 --> 01:33:01.409
COULD HELP EVALUATE POTENTIAL

01:33:01.475 --> 01:33:04.612
REVENUE STEAM STREAMS FOR SEP.

01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:08.249
A POLICY ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT.

01:33:08.316 --> 01:33:09.717
MODELS COULD BE INFORMATIVE. FOR

01:33:09.784 --> 01:33:10.952

01:33:27.668 --> 01:33:29.370
CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF ON ITS

01:33:29.437 --> 01:33:30.604
LEADERSHIP.

01:33:30.671 --> 01:33:32.540
IF WE WANT TO STAY IN THE LEAD

01:33:32.606 --> 01:33:34.775
WE MUST FULLY COMMIT TO THIS

01:33:34.842 --> 01:33:35.776
WORK.

01:33:35.843 --> 01:33:37.912
WE WELCOME THIS CHECK IN.

01:33:37.979 --> 01:33:39.847
AT TEN YEARS IT'S APPROPRIATE.

01:33:39.914 --> 01:33:41.082
SOMETIMES I DRAW A PARALLEL

01:33:41.148 --> 01:33:43.250
BETWEEN A GROWING CHILD AND THE

01:33:43.317 --> 01:33:44.819
GROWTH OF THE SAFER CONSUMER

01:33:44.885 --> 01:33:46.187
PRODUCTS PROGRAM.

01:33:46.253 --> 01:33:48.622
WE WERE A TODDLER IN TWENTY

01:33:48.689 --> 01:33:49.523
FOURTEEN WHEN WE NAMED WHEN WE

01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:50.891

01:33:50.958 --> 01:33:52.560
PRIORITY PRODUCTS.

01:33:52.626 --> 01:33:54.295
AND QUITE FRANKLY WE FELL ON OUR

01:33:54.362 --> 01:33:56.130
BOMB A FEW TIMES.

01:33:56.197 --> 01:33:58.332
BUT WE GOT UP AND KEPT MOVING.

01:33:58.399 --> 01:33:59.066
AND NOW WE'RE LIKE A TEN YEAR

01:33:59.133 --> 01:33:59.834
OLD.

01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:01.402
WE HAVE SOME SPROUT A SURPRISING

01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:02.636
NUMBER OF SKILLS AND WE'RE

01:34:02.703 --> 01:34:05.639
LEARNING IN AN ASTONISHING PACE.

01:34:05.706 --> 01:34:08.909
MAYBE AS A TEENAGER WILL REALLY

01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:11.412
START TO CALL CAUSE SOME TROUBLE.

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:12.179
WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE THE

01:34:12.246 --> 01:34:13.247
IMPACT.

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:14.749

OUR WORK PLAN.

01:34:19.954 --> 01:34:21.222
WE KNOW THAT MANUFACTURERS

01:34:21.288 --> 01:34:22.790
DIDN'T EVEN WAIT FOR US TO

01:34:22.857 --> 01:34:24.892
COMPLETE OUR REGULATIONS TO LIST

01:34:24.959 --> 01:34:27.094
SLEEP PRODUCTS CONTAINING SOME

01:34:27.161 --> 01:34:28.829
FLAME RETARDANTS AS A PRIORITY

01:34:28.896 --> 01:34:29.830
PRODUCT.

01:34:29.897 --> 01:34:31.832
BEFORE THEY STARTED REMOVING THE

01:34:31.899 --> 01:34:33.768
FLAME RETARDANTS THAT WE THAT WE

01:34:33.834 --> 01:34:35.936
NAMED.

01:34:36.003 --> 01:34:37.538
EVERYONE HERE WANTS THE SAME

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:40.307

A VERY CLEAR AND VERY HELPFUL

01:36:21.909 --> 01:36:23.410
PRESENTATION.

01:36:23.477 --> 01:36:24.111

APPRECIATE YOUR G. AND THE

01:36:27.882 --> 01:36:29.383
PHILOSOPHY BEHIND --

01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:30.784
THE WORK THAT YOU DO --

01:36:30.851 --> 01:36:32.386
FIRST I WANT TO COMMENT ON

01:36:32.453 --> 01:36:34.121
SOMETHING THAT MY FRIEND AND

01:36:34.188 --> 01:36:35.022
COLLEAGUE --

01:36:35.089 --> 01:36:36.257
ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY JUST A

01:36:36.323 --> 01:36:38.092
PICKY BACK ON HIS STATEMENT

01:36:38.159 --> 01:36:39.293
ABOUT.

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:40.761
A SOMETIMES HAVING.

01:36:40.828 --> 01:36:42.329
TO MAKE DECISIONS WITHOUT YOU

01:36:42.396 --> 01:36:44.565
KNOW HAVING A HUGE CONSENSUS OR

01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:46.333
WITH THERE BEING DIFFERENT FACTS

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.434
ON BOTH SIDES --

01:36:47.501 --> 01:36:49.637
I LOOK AT IT A LITTLE BIT

01:36:49.703 --> 01:36:51.872
DIFFERENTLY I LOOK AT WITH THE

01:36:51.939 --> 01:36:53.340
FACT THAT WHEN PEOPLE GO WHEN

01:36:53.407 --> 01:36:54.808
THEY PURCHASE PRODUCTS.

01:36:54.875 --> 01:36:56.210
THEY ASSUME THAT THOSE PRODUCTS

01:36:56.277 --> 01:36:57.511
ARE SAFE.

01:36:57.578 --> 01:36:59.313
THEY ASSUME THEY'RE SAFE BECAUSE

01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:00.748
WE ALLOW THEM TO BE SOLD.

01:37:00.814 --> 01:37:02.283
AND WHILE THERE ARE SOME

01:37:02.349 --> 01:37:05.619
CONSUMERS WHO HAVE THE WHERE

01:37:05.686 --> 01:37:07.555
WITH ALL AND THE ABILITY.

01:37:07.621 --> 01:37:09.723
AND A TIME TO DO SOME RESEARCH

01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:11.125
THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE

01:37:11.192 --> 01:37:12.660
DON'T -- IN

01:37:12.726 --> 01:37:14.795
FACT IF I WALK TO MY OWN HOME I

01:37:14.862 --> 01:37:17.064
COULDN'T TELL YOU WHAT PRODUCTS

01:37:17.131 --> 01:37:19.433
WERE RISKY AND WHAT WARRANT --

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:21.669
BUT WHEN I GO IN AND BUY

01:37:21.735 --> 01:37:22.970
SOMETHING YOU KNOW I HOPE IT

01:37:23.037 --> 01:37:25.005
SAFE I THINK I KNOW ENOUGH TO BE

01:37:25.072 --> 01:37:26.106
SKEPTICAL AND A LITTLE BIT

01:37:26.173 --> 01:37:28.509
NERVOUS BUT I I DON'T.

01:37:28.576 --> 01:37:30.244
I DON'T FEEL THE CONFIDENCE THAT

01:37:30.311 --> 01:37:31.612
I WOULD LIKE TO FEEL.

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:35.716
AS A CITIZEN OF THIS SO I THINK

01:37:35.783 --> 01:37:37.618
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO

01:37:37.685 --> 01:37:39.653
ENSURE THAT OUR CITIZENS AND OUR

01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:41.088
CONSUMERS ARE SAFE.

01:37:41.155 --> 01:37:42.389
AND THAT THAT IS THE PREDOMINANT

01:37:42.456 --> 01:37:44.325
RESPONSIBILITY WE HAVE ABOVE ALL

01:37:44.391 --> 01:37:45.059
ELSE.

01:37:45.125 --> 01:37:46.393
AND WHILE SOME DECISIONS ABOUT

01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:48.028
WHETHER OR NOT TO FLORIDA A

01:37:48.095 --> 01:37:49.897
WATER HAS HAVE PUBLIC HEALTH --

01:37:49.964 --> 01:37:51.865
BENEFITS AND RISKS ON BOTH SIDES

01:37:51.932 --> 01:37:54.134
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

01:37:54.201 --> 01:37:55.402
PRODUCTS THAT WE'RE TALKING

01:37:55.469 --> 01:37:57.738
ABOUT ARE NOT LIFE AND DEATH ARE

01:37:57.805 --> 01:37:59.039
PUBLIC -- A

01:37:59.106 --> 01:38:00.040
HEALTH --

01:38:00.107 --> 01:38:01.875
NECESSITIES A LOT OF THEM ARE

01:38:01.942 --> 01:38:03.077
CONVENIENCES.

01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:04.411
AND SO THEY HAVE AN EXTRA

01:38:04.478 --> 01:38:06.213
RESPONSIBILITY I THINK --

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:07.348
TO BE SAFE.

01:38:07.414 --> 01:38:10.784
SO WITH THAT AS AS MY PHILOSOPHY

01:38:10.851 --> 01:38:14.088
I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU --

01:38:14.154 --> 01:38:15.823
THOUGH AND ONE OTHER COMMENT IS

01:38:15.889 --> 01:38:17.191
THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF OUR

01:38:17.258 --> 01:38:18.759
MANUFACTURERS AND PRODUCERS WHO

01:38:18.826 --> 01:38:20.127
ARE VERY RESPONSIBLE AND WHO

01:38:20.194 --> 01:38:21.262
WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THINGS AND

01:38:21.328 --> 01:38:22.563
THEY ARE TRUSTED BRANDS I KNOW A

01:38:22.630 --> 01:38:23.831
LOT OF THEM ARE HERE.

01:38:23.897 --> 01:38:25.566
BUT THAT'S NOT THE FULL RANGE OF

01:38:25.633 --> 01:38:27.201
MANUFACTURERS AND WE CERTAINLY

01:38:27.268 --> 01:38:29.036
HAVE MANUFACTURERS THAT ARE NOT

01:38:29.103 --> 01:38:30.137
EVEN IN THE STATE OR IN THIS

01:38:30.204 --> 01:38:30.938
COUNTRY.

01:38:31.005 --> 01:38:34.541
WHO OPERATE UNDER VERY DIFFERENT --

01:38:34.608 --> 01:38:36.944
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND SO

01:38:37.011 --> 01:38:38.212
BUT THEY'RE ALSO ALLOWED TO BE

01:38:38.279 --> 01:38:39.380
SOLD HERE AND SO WE HAVE AN

01:38:39.446 --> 01:38:42.449
EXTRA RESPONSIBILITY WITH REGARD

01:38:42.516 --> 01:38:43.017
TO THAT AND PUBLIC HEALTH AS

01:38:43.083 --> 01:38:46.186
WELL -- WHEN

01:38:46.253 --> 01:38:46.553
I WANT -- TO

01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:47.655
ACKNOWLEDGE TO THAT I BELIEVE

01:38:47.721 --> 01:38:51.959
THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT YOUR OF

01:38:52.026 --> 01:38:53.494
DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY IS.

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:54.762
UNDER FUNDED AND WE SHOULD

01:38:54.828 --> 01:38:56.597
CHANGE THAT AND GIVE YOU A LOT

01:38:56.664 --> 01:38:58.699
MORE RESOURCES BECAUSE I THINK

01:38:58.766 --> 01:39:01.101
THIS IS IMPERATIVE --

01:39:01.168 --> 01:39:02.670
I NOTICE FROM MY FOR MY

01:39:02.736 --> 01:39:03.871
CONSTITUENTS I THINK IT IS FOR A

01:39:03.937 --> 01:39:04.872
LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE IF

01:39:04.938 --> 01:39:06.473
THEY UNDERSTOOD --

01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:07.841
WHAT WAS ACTUALLY IN THE

01:39:07.908 --> 01:39:08.976
PRODUCTS THAT THEY PURCHASE

01:39:09.043 --> 01:39:10.511
QUITE INNOCENTLY THINKING THAT

01:39:10.577 --> 01:39:11.545
IF THEY BUY WOULD TôI THAT IT'S

01:39:11.612 --> 01:39:12.646
JUST MATTER WHAT?

01:39:12.713 --> 01:39:14.415
AND THAT'S YOU KNOW WE KNOW

01:39:14.481 --> 01:39:15.683
THAT'S NOT TRUE BUT THEY DON'T.

01:39:15.749 --> 01:39:17.918
SO FIRST MY FIRST QUESTION IS

01:39:17.985 --> 01:39:19.253
DOES T. T. S. S..

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.821
S. C. HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

01:39:20.888 --> 01:39:21.989
REGULATE THE CHEMICALS THAT ARE

01:39:22.056 --> 01:39:24.024
USED IN FOOD AND DRINK PACKAGING

01:39:24.091 --> 01:39:25.359
UNDER THE SAFE CONSUMER PRODUCTS

01:39:25.426 --> 01:39:26.994
PROGRAM AND IF SO ARE YOU

01:39:27.061 --> 01:39:28.696
CONSIDERING ANY OF THOSE RIGHT

01:39:28.762 --> 01:39:30.698
NOW AS PRIORITY --

01:39:30.764 --> 01:39:31.465
PRODUCTS.

01:39:31.532 --> 01:39:33.367
SO WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:39:33.434 --> 01:39:34.702
NAME -- FOOD

01:39:34.768 --> 01:39:36.337
PACKAGING AS A CONSUMER PRODUCT

01:39:36.403 --> 01:39:38.105
THE DEFINITION A CONSUMER

01:39:38.172 --> 01:39:39.640
PRODUCT IS QUITE BROAD TO BE

01:39:39.707 --> 01:39:41.308
REFERENCED OTHER DEFINITIONS IN

01:39:41.375 --> 01:39:43.010
CALIFORNIA STATUTE.

01:39:43.077 --> 01:39:44.978
IN OUR REGULATIONS.

01:39:45.045 --> 01:39:46.980
AND ON THAT.

01:39:47.047 --> 01:39:47.748
IT INCLUDES.

01:39:47.815 --> 01:39:48.882
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING EXCEPT

01:39:48.949 --> 01:39:51.719
FOR MEDICAL DENTAL DEVICES AND A

01:39:51.785 --> 01:39:53.587
PESTICIDES REALLY THOSE OF THE

01:39:53.654 --> 01:39:56.156
THE MAJOR AREAS THAT ARE.

01:39:56.223 --> 01:39:57.925
THAT WE CAN'T ADDRESS THROUGH

01:39:57.991 --> 01:39:59.126
OUR REGULATIONS SO FOOD

01:39:59.193 --> 01:40:00.794
PACKAGING IS ON THE TABLE.

01:40:00.861 --> 01:40:02.996
AND WE HAVE A GROUP OF STAFF WHO

01:40:03.063 --> 01:40:04.732
ARE ACTIVELY RESEARCHING THEM

01:40:04.798 --> 01:40:06.734
THERE ARE QUITE A RANGE OF

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:08.102
CHEMICALS THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:40:08.168 --> 01:40:09.903
TALK ABOUT THE P. FAST CHEMICALS

01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:12.973
THAT ARE IN FOOD PACKAGING --

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:15.909
WE HA HAS LISTED AND CHEMICALS

01:40:15.976 --> 01:40:17.444
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT

01:40:17.511 --> 01:40:19.046
HAVE TURNED UP --

01:40:19.113 --> 01:40:20.347
IN FOOD PACKAGING THERE WAS A

01:40:20.414 --> 01:40:22.282
LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT BPA THERE'S

01:40:22.349 --> 01:40:23.584
SOME CONCERN AROUND AROUND

01:40:23.650 --> 01:40:26.053
STYRENE THAT SAID WE'RE VERY

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:27.121
MUCH IN THE PROCESS OF

01:40:27.187 --> 01:40:29.490
EVALUATING THOSE THINGS AND WILL

01:40:29.556 --> 01:40:32.226
LIKELY HAVE IN A WORKSHOP.

01:40:32.292 --> 01:40:33.594
STE WHEN.

01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:34.828
LATER THIS YEAR JUST LIKE I KNOW

01:40:34.895 --> 01:40:37.331
TO PROPOSED TO EXPLORE THE TOPIC

01:40:37.398 --> 01:40:39.767
MORE FULLY AND RIGHT.

01:40:39.833 --> 01:40:40.567
AND YOU COULD CHILDREN'S HEALTH

01:40:40.634 --> 01:40:41.635
PRIORITY IN THIS PROCESS IN IN

01:40:41.702 --> 01:40:43.604
OUR WORK PLAN WE STATED SOME

01:40:43.670 --> 01:40:45.139
POLICY PRIORITIES AND CHILDREN'S

01:40:45.205 --> 01:40:46.907
HEALTH AND AND THAT INCLUDES NOT

01:40:46.974 --> 01:40:48.509
JUST CHILDREN BUT ALSO WOMEN OF

01:40:48.575 --> 01:40:49.910
CHILDBEARING AGE BECAUSE THAT

01:40:49.977 --> 01:40:51.745
CAN HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON

01:40:51.812 --> 01:40:53.380
CHILDREN'S HEALTH --

01:40:53.447 --> 01:40:56.884
SO WE'VE WE PRIORITIZE THOSE SO

01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:58.519
SO INTENT IN A IF I AM INCORRECT

01:40:58.585 --> 01:41:00.220
IN THIS PLEASE CORRECT ME BUT MY

01:41:00.287 --> 01:41:01.722
UNDERSTANDING FROM LISTENING TO

01:41:01.789 --> 01:41:08.095
THAT IN TEN YEARS.

01:41:08.162 --> 01:41:09.430
DTS SEASON DOBBY REGULATIONS

01:41:09.496 --> 01:41:10.631
RELATING TO ONLY THREE CHEMICALS

01:41:10.697 --> 01:41:11.465
AS LISTED ANOTHER THREE IS

01:41:11.532 --> 01:41:12.232
PRIORITY PRODUCTS.

01:41:12.299 --> 01:41:13.100
BUT THE LIST OF YOUR CANDIDATE

01:41:13.167 --> 01:41:16.236
CHEMICALS IN THE LIST IS OVER

01:41:16.303 --> 01:41:16.737
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FOR

01:41:16.804 --> 01:41:29.249
CONSIDERATION.

01:41:29.316 --> 01:41:29.883
LET ME CAN I FOR YOU IF I MAY I

01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:30.484
WILL RESTATE FAT AND ASSEMBLY

01:41:30.551 --> 01:41:31.151
DIFFERENT WAYS SO YES WE'VE WE

01:41:31.218 --> 01:41:31.685
RELEASED AN INFORMATIONAL

01:41:31.752 --> 01:41:33.153
CANDIDATE CHEMICALS LIST.

01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:34.755
AND ON THAT LIST I NO LONGER SAY

01:41:34.822 --> 01:41:35.389
HOW MANY CHEMICALS ARE ON THE

01:41:35.456 --> 01:41:36.323
LIST AND THE REASON I DON'T DO

01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.990
THAT IS BECAUSE ONE OF THE LISTS

01:41:37.057 --> 01:41:38.292
THAT WE REFERENCE IS THE

01:41:38.358 --> 01:41:39.693
CALIFORNIA BIOMONITORING

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:41.228
PRIORITY CHEMICALS LIST.

01:41:41.295 --> 01:41:42.696
AND THAT LIST ALLOW THEIR USING

01:41:42.763 --> 01:41:44.031
A CLASS APPROACH TO CHEMICALS SO

01:41:44.097 --> 01:41:45.232
WHEN THEY SAID THE CLASS OF P.

01:41:45.299 --> 01:41:46.667
FAST WE ADOPTED THAT ENTIRE

01:41:46.733 --> 01:41:47.367
GROUP OF CHEMICALS.

01:41:47.434 --> 01:41:48.135
WHEN WE WHEN WE FIRST DID THAT

01:41:48.202 --> 01:41:49.269
WE THOUGHT THAT WAS ABOUT FOUR

01:41:49.336 --> 01:41:49.870
THOUSAND CHEMICALS AND NOW WE

01:41:49.937 --> 01:41:51.071
THINK IT'S ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND

01:41:51.138 --> 01:41:51.905
CHEMICALS SO?

01:41:51.972 --> 01:41:53.407
YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE

01:41:53.474 --> 01:41:55.609
AND SO IT IS IN THE THOUSANDS OF

01:41:55.676 --> 01:41:57.344
CHEMICALS BUT I CAN'T PUT A

01:41:57.411 --> 01:41:58.078
NUMBER ON IT.

01:41:58.145 --> 01:42:00.180
EASILY BUT IN TERMS OF THE

01:42:00.247 --> 01:42:01.615
REGULATIONS OF YOU'VE ADAPTED SO

01:42:01.682 --> 01:42:03.684
MANY THREE PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN

01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:07.521
ADOPTED OKAY IT SEEMS IT I MEAN

01:42:07.588 --> 01:42:08.422
IT SEEMS TO ME.

01:42:08.489 --> 01:42:12.259
UNLESS I ASSUME THAT THOSE FIVE

01:42:12.326 --> 01:42:12.893
THOUSAND ARE NOT GOING TO END UP

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:15.295
BEING REGULATED WHICH YES AND

01:42:15.362 --> 01:42:16.797
OKAY SO YOU WOULD AGREE THAT

01:42:16.864 --> 01:42:18.365
THERE IS THIS TREMENDOUS BACKLOG

01:42:18.432 --> 01:42:19.900
YES AND AND MEANWHILE WE'RE

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:21.468
ALLOWING ALL OF THOSE PRODUCTS

01:42:21.535 --> 01:42:22.436
TO BE SOLD.

01:42:22.503 --> 01:42:23.737
IN CALIFORNIA BEFORE WE REALLY

01:42:23.804 --> 01:42:25.606
DONE THE REVIEW TO KNOW IF

01:42:25.672 --> 01:42:26.373
THEY'RE SAFE.

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:28.275
CORRECT OKAY --

01:42:28.342 --> 01:42:29.676
SO WHAT DO YOU NEED TO

01:42:29.743 --> 01:42:31.578
ACCELERATE THAT PROCESS BECAUSE

01:42:31.645 --> 01:42:32.946
IF I WAS THOUGH IF I WAS IN

01:42:33.013 --> 01:42:34.014
CHARGE.

01:42:34.081 --> 01:42:35.148
OF ALL OF THIS I WOULD ALLOW

01:42:35.215 --> 01:42:36.316
ANYTHING TO BE SOLD UNTIL THEY

01:42:36.383 --> 01:42:38.285
WERE PROVEN SAFE BUT THAT'S JUST

01:42:38.352 --> 01:42:38.819
ME.

01:42:38.886 --> 01:42:41.355
SO -- SO

01:42:41.421 --> 01:42:42.923
WHAT DO YOU NEED. TO TO

01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:44.625
ACCELERATE THIS PROCESS AND GET

01:42:44.691 --> 01:42:47.094
THROUGH MORE OF THESE CHEMICALS

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:49.463
MORE QUICKLY.

01:42:49.530 --> 01:42:50.764
SO.

01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:51.899
AGAIN YOUR QUESTION IS HAS

01:42:51.965 --> 01:42:53.600
MULTIPLE LAYERS TO IT --

01:42:53.667 --> 01:42:56.136
IN TERMS OF THE TIME THAT IT

01:42:56.203 --> 01:42:58.872
TAKES TO DO THINGS WERE YOU KNOW.

01:42:58.939 --> 01:42:59.473
I WRENCH IN SOME OF THE TRADE

01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:00.674
OFFS BETWEEN FOR INSTANCE

01:43:00.741 --> 01:43:02.743
TRANSPARENCY AND PUBLIC

01:43:02.809 --> 01:43:05.879
ENGAGEMENT AND MOVING QUICKLY --

01:43:05.946 --> 01:43:06.914
AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO SACRIFICE

01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:08.849
THAT FOR INSTANCE --

01:43:08.916 --> 01:43:10.217
WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE APA

01:43:10.284 --> 01:43:11.184
PROCESS TO GET A PRIORITY

01:43:11.251 --> 01:43:13.420
PRODUCT LISTED AND THAT MEANS

01:43:13.487 --> 01:43:14.821
RESPONDING TO ALL THE COMMENTS

01:43:14.888 --> 01:43:16.156
THAT CENTRIST SO THOSE ARE

01:43:16.223 --> 01:43:18.025
CONSTRAINTS UNLESS --

01:43:18.091 --> 01:43:21.395
UNLESS WE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE A

01:43:21.461 --> 01:43:22.496
FOR A PRIORITY PRODUCT LISTING

01:43:22.563 --> 01:43:24.398
THAT'S GONNA TAKE WHAT IT'S

01:43:24.464 --> 01:43:25.566
GOING TO TAKE --

01:43:25.632 --> 01:43:29.770
I WOULD SAY THAT --

01:43:29.836 --> 01:43:30.537
SOME OF THE RIVER THE

01:43:30.604 --> 01:43:32.739
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT

01:43:32.806 --> 01:43:33.974
BETTER CALL IN INFORMATION.

01:43:34.041 --> 01:43:36.610
DID A CALL AND WE HAVE SPENT.

01:43:36.677 --> 01:43:39.413
SURPRISING AMOUNT OF TIME TRYING

01:43:39.479 --> 01:43:40.981
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT CHEMICALS ARE

01:43:41.048 --> 01:43:42.182
AND WHAT PRODUCTS.

01:43:42.249 --> 01:43:43.850
IT'S HARD.

01:43:43.917 --> 01:43:45.786
IT IS REMARKABLY HARD THERE

01:43:45.852 --> 01:43:48.288
INDUSTRY HAS COMMITTED TO DOING

01:43:48.355 --> 01:43:49.556
SHARING MORE INFORMATION BUT

01:43:49.623 --> 01:43:51.658
OFTEN THAT'S BEHIND PAY WALLS

01:43:51.725 --> 01:43:53.393
THAT WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS.

01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:54.795
TO SO --

01:43:54.861 --> 01:43:56.563
THAT'S THAT'S ONE BIG CHALLENGE

01:43:56.630 --> 01:43:57.664
AND IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE

01:43:57.731 --> 01:43:59.466
HAVE CONTROL OVER OR IS THERE

01:43:59.533 --> 01:44:00.801
SOME FEDERAL PREEMPTION.

01:44:00.867 --> 01:44:03.103
THAT WOULD PREVENT US FROM

01:44:03.170 --> 01:44:04.304
REQUIRING.

01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:05.839
THAT SHARING OF INFORMATION NOT

01:44:05.906 --> 01:44:07.040
NECESSARILY WITH THE PUBLIC BUT

01:44:07.107 --> 01:44:08.575
WITH YOU.

01:44:08.642 --> 01:44:10.043
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION --

01:44:10.110 --> 01:44:11.878
I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANY

01:44:11.945 --> 01:44:15.048
PROHIBITION AGAINST IT --

01:44:15.115 --> 01:44:16.183
I THINK THAT IF IF IT WERE

01:44:16.249 --> 01:44:17.050
CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS

01:44:17.117 --> 01:44:18.952
INFORMATION THAT HAD BEEN SHARED

01:44:19.019 --> 01:44:21.321
WITH USEPA UNDER TOSCA AND THERE

01:44:21.388 --> 01:44:23.490
MAY BE SOME RESTRICTIONS ABOUT

01:44:23.557 --> 01:44:24.758
HOW THEY WOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT

01:44:24.825 --> 01:44:26.426
SHARING INFORMATION THROUGH THAT

01:44:26.493 --> 01:44:28.295
CHANNEL BUT IN OTHER WAYS I I

01:44:28.362 --> 01:44:29.496
WOULD THINK THAT WE WOULD.

01:44:29.563 --> 01:44:32.099
HAVE SOME ABILITY TO TO TAP INTO

01:44:32.165 --> 01:44:33.800
THAT INFORMATION --

01:44:33.867 --> 01:44:37.404
AGAIN THE RESOURCES --

01:44:37.471 --> 01:44:38.672
HE BROUGHT A NUMBER OF NEW STAFF

01:44:38.739 --> 01:44:41.241
ON JUST JUST WITHIN THE LAST

01:44:41.308 --> 01:44:43.310
MONTH WE NINE WHEN ALL IS SAID

01:44:43.377 --> 01:44:44.745
AND DONE. EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT NEW

01:44:44.811 --> 01:44:45.746
STAFF MEMBERS ALL AT ONCE AND

01:44:45.812 --> 01:44:48.181
YOU CAN JUST ALREADY SEE HOW BIG

01:44:48.248 --> 01:44:49.616
A DIFFERENCE THAT MAKES.

01:44:49.683 --> 01:44:51.184
IN TERMS OF THEM COMING UP TO

01:44:51.251 --> 01:44:52.919
SPEED DEVELOPING REC PACKAGES

01:44:52.986 --> 01:44:54.187
MORE QUICKLY I GUESS MY QUESTION

01:44:54.254 --> 01:44:55.722
IS DO YOU HAVE A WISH LIST THAT

01:44:55.789 --> 01:44:57.124
WOULD HELP YOU GET THROUGH THESE

01:44:57.190 --> 01:44:58.291
A LOT MORE QUICKLY --

01:44:58.358 --> 01:45:00.127
MORE STAFF IS IS PROBABLY MY

01:45:00.193 --> 01:45:02.796
NUMBER ONE WISH LIST --

01:45:02.863 --> 01:45:03.664
AND THEN BETTER DATA CALLING

01:45:03.730 --> 01:45:05.098
AUTHORITY IS VERY HIGH ON MY

01:45:05.165 --> 01:45:06.800
WISH LIST AND THEN I WOULD SAY

01:45:06.867 --> 01:45:08.035
THAT -- WE

01:45:08.101 --> 01:45:10.771
THINK THAT THE TRAINS THOSE THAT

01:45:10.837 --> 01:45:12.105
HAVE BEEN.

01:45:12.172 --> 01:45:13.774
GAINING MOMENTUM ARE GOING TO BE

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:15.776
VERY HELPFUL FOR US BUT I WOULD

01:45:15.842 --> 01:45:17.544
SAY ON THAT FRONT --

01:45:17.611 --> 01:45:19.179
SME OF THOSE HAVE COME WITHOUT

01:45:19.246 --> 01:45:20.714
RESOURCES SO FOR INSTANCE THE

01:45:20.781 --> 01:45:22.149
CLEANING PRODUCT RIGHT TO KNOW

01:45:22.215 --> 01:45:23.917
IS HOMELESS IN TERMS OF IN TERMS

01:45:23.984 --> 01:45:25.986
OF A STATUTE NOBODY REALLY OWNS

01:45:26.053 --> 01:45:26.687
THAT.

01:45:26.753 --> 01:45:28.889
AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S AN

01:45:28.955 --> 01:45:31.024
AREA WHERE WE CAN'T GET THE

01:45:31.091 --> 01:45:33.994
MAXIMUM VALUE OUT OF IT BECAUSE

01:45:34.061 --> 01:45:35.328
YOU KNOW NOBODY'S WE DON'T EVEN

01:45:35.395 --> 01:45:37.597
THERE'S NO THERE'S NO MECHANISM

01:45:37.664 --> 01:45:39.299
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S

01:45:39.366 --> 01:45:41.568
ENFORCED AND IT'S IT'S KIND OF

01:45:41.635 --> 01:45:43.036
IN LIMBO BETWEEN MULTIPLE

01:45:43.103 --> 01:45:43.904
DEPARTMENTS AND DO YOU HAVE

01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:44.504
DEDICATED.

01:45:44.571 --> 01:45:45.939
FUNDING SOURCE AND WHAT IS IT

01:45:46.006 --> 01:45:47.474
IT'S THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES

01:45:47.541 --> 01:45:49.409
CONTROL ACCOUNT THAT IS IT IS IT

01:45:49.476 --> 01:45:51.845
A IS IT A SEE A STATIC AMOUNT.

01:45:51.912 --> 01:45:52.946
IT'S IT'S IT'S FUNDED BY

01:45:53.013 --> 01:45:54.548
ENVIRONMENTAL FEES IT HAS A LOT

01:45:54.614 --> 01:45:56.750
OF MY VARIATION FLUCTUATION AND

01:45:56.817 --> 01:45:58.919
IT'S USED BY MUCH BIGGER PARTS

01:45:58.985 --> 01:46:00.420
OF THE PROGRAM BY THAT OF THE

01:46:00.487 --> 01:46:01.054
DEPARTMENT.

01:46:01.121 --> 01:46:02.656
OKAY I JUST HAVE A FEW MORE --

01:46:02.723 --> 01:46:04.491
SO THE LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSED

01:46:04.558 --> 01:46:05.425
BILLS OVER THE YEARS DEALING

01:46:05.492 --> 01:46:07.027
WITH ON INDIVIDUAL CHEMICALS

01:46:07.094 --> 01:46:08.662
THAT COME TO OUR ATTENTION AND A

01:46:08.729 --> 01:46:11.364
LOT OF TIMES WERE TOLD.

01:46:11.431 --> 01:46:12.599
NO NO.

01:46:12.666 --> 01:46:13.433
THAT'S NOT YOUR JOB WE HAVE THE

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:15.035
GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM THEY'RE

01:46:15.102 --> 01:46:16.503
GOING TO TAKE CARE OF IT RIGHT.

01:46:16.570 --> 01:46:19.005
SO THAT CAN BE FRUSTRATING TO

01:46:19.072 --> 01:46:20.307
OUR COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY HEARING

01:46:20.373 --> 01:46:21.775
THAT YOU'VE GOT FIVE THOUSAND

01:46:21.842 --> 01:46:22.909
CHEMICALS AND YOU'VE YOU KNOW

01:46:22.976 --> 01:46:24.444
GOTTEN THROUGH A HANDFUL OF THEM.

01:46:24.511 --> 01:46:25.812
SO.

01:46:25.879 --> 01:46:27.581
DOES IT MAKE SENSE FOR US TO ACT

01:46:27.647 --> 01:46:29.249
ON SOME OF THE SUBSTANCES GIVEN

01:46:29.316 --> 01:46:30.751
HOW CHALLENGING IT'S BEEN FOR

01:46:30.817 --> 01:46:32.152
YOU TO REGULATE THEM.

01:46:32.219 --> 01:46:33.520
THERE ARE GOING TO BE CASES

01:46:33.587 --> 01:46:35.155
WHERE WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR THE

01:46:35.222 --> 01:46:38.158
LEGISLATURE TO ACT --

01:46:38.225 --> 01:46:39.893
PART OF THAT DEPENDS ON FOR

01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:41.061
INSTANCE THE POTENTIAL FOR

01:46:41.128 --> 01:46:42.729
REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTES.

01:46:42.796 --> 01:46:44.097
IF IF YOU'RE ACTING ON A

01:46:44.164 --> 01:46:45.098
CHEMICAL WHERE THERE'S A HIGH

01:46:45.165 --> 01:46:46.433
POTENTIAL FOR REGRETTABLE

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:48.235
SUBSTITUTES I THINK IT'S

01:46:48.301 --> 01:46:49.736
RESPONSIBLE TO GO THROUGH THE

01:46:49.803 --> 01:46:53.039
ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS PROCESS --

01:46:53.106 --> 01:46:54.541
IF IT'S SOMETHING WHERE

01:46:54.608 --> 01:46:56.510
EVERYBODY KNOWS THERE'S AN

01:46:56.576 --> 01:46:58.278
ALTERNATIVE OUT THERE AND MAKE A

01:46:58.345 --> 01:46:59.379
COUPLE MANUFACTURERS HAVE

01:46:59.446 --> 01:47:00.781
ALREADY ADOPTED A SAFER

01:47:00.847 --> 01:47:02.082
ALTERNATIVE.

01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:03.550
YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS

01:47:03.617 --> 01:47:05.552
IT REALLY A IS THERE AN EXCUSE

01:47:05.619 --> 01:47:06.553
TO STILL HAVE THAT PRODUCT ON

01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:08.421
THE MARKET SO --

01:47:08.488 --> 01:47:09.990
I THINK IT'S SITUATIONAL BUT I

01:47:10.056 --> 01:47:11.591
DO THINK THERE ARE CASES IN

01:47:11.658 --> 01:47:13.827
WHICH IT MAKES SENSE BUT SAYING

01:47:13.894 --> 01:47:15.295
THAT WE SHOULDN'T BAN.

01:47:15.362 --> 01:47:16.930
A DANGEROUS CHEMICAL BECAUSE

01:47:16.997 --> 01:47:19.733
THEY MIGHT YOU SOMETHING WE

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:21.468
SHOULD KNOW THAT AND WE SHOULD

01:47:21.535 --> 01:47:22.335
PROBABLY BàN ALL THOSE

01:47:22.402 --> 01:47:24.704
CHEMICALS BUT I JUST I JUST HAVE

01:47:24.771 --> 01:47:26.206
A EASE TO ISSUE MORE IT'S REALLY

01:47:26.273 --> 01:47:28.175
YOU KNOW PESTICIDES ARE THE BEST

01:47:28.241 --> 01:47:29.876
EXAMPLE OF THAT.

01:47:29.943 --> 01:47:31.244
WHAT WE'VE DONE --

01:47:31.311 --> 01:47:32.412
TO EVEN GETTING RID A LEADING

01:47:32.479 --> 01:47:34.214
GAS AND GETTING IN TV AND NOW WE

01:47:34.281 --> 01:47:35.715
HAVE GROUNDWATER COMMUNICATION --

01:47:35.782 --> 01:47:37.284
CONTAMINATION ALL OVER THE STATE

01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:39.820
WE END UP WITH THE BPA TO BE PS

01:47:39.886 --> 01:47:40.687
TO WHATEVER.

01:47:40.754 --> 01:47:44.090
AND AND SO WHEN.

01:47:44.157 --> 01:47:47.394
YES THAT REALLY HAS TO INFORM

01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:49.129
THE DECISION.

01:47:49.196 --> 01:47:50.463
OKAY -- TWO

01:47:50.530 --> 01:47:51.231
MORE QUICK QUESTIONS THE FIRST

01:47:51.298 --> 01:47:52.098
IS --

01:47:52.165 --> 01:47:53.333
DEREGULATION'S FRAMEWORK NOTES

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:55.435
THAT THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS

01:47:55.502 --> 01:47:57.871
COMPETITION D. T. S. C. TO ADOPT

01:47:57.938 --> 01:47:59.239
A PARTY PS PRODUCT AND I'M

01:47:59.306 --> 01:48:00.373
WONDERING IF ANYONE HAS DONE

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:02.642
THAT WE'VE HAD TO PETITIONS HAVE

01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:04.077
YOU ACCEPTED THEM A NO THE FIRST

01:48:04.144 --> 01:48:06.446
PETITION WAS DENIED THE THE

01:48:06.513 --> 01:48:08.248
PETITION PROCESS IS PRETTY.

01:48:08.315 --> 01:48:09.349
EXTENSIVE.

01:48:09.416 --> 01:48:11.084
AND REALLY WHAT THE PETITION

01:48:11.151 --> 01:48:12.853
PETITIONER'S RECORD TO DO IS DO

01:48:12.919 --> 01:48:14.688
THE SAME LEVEL OF DOCUMENTATION

01:48:14.754 --> 01:48:15.989
OF ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE

01:48:16.056 --> 01:48:17.891
CALLED OUT IN THE REGULATIONS

01:48:17.958 --> 01:48:19.626
THAT WE'RE REQUIRED TO CONSIDER.

01:48:19.693 --> 01:48:21.261
WHEN THEY SUBMIT THEIR PETITIONS

01:48:21.328 --> 01:48:23.430
SO IN THE --

01:48:23.496 --> 01:48:27.834
FOR LININGS AND THE PETITIONER --

01:48:27.901 --> 01:48:29.369
SUBMITTED A ON A FAIR AMOUNT OF

01:48:29.436 --> 01:48:30.904
INFORMATION WE WORK WITH THE

01:48:30.971 --> 01:48:32.038
PETITIONER TO STRENGTHEN THE

01:48:32.105 --> 01:48:33.874
PETITION IN THE END WE DENIED IT

01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:35.775
HOWEVER WE THOUGHT THERE WAS

01:48:35.842 --> 01:48:37.210
ENOUGH CONCERN RAISED IN THE

01:48:37.277 --> 01:48:38.612
PETITION THAT THAT WAS ONE OF

01:48:38.678 --> 01:48:40.146
THE PRIME MOTIVATORS FOR US

01:48:40.213 --> 01:48:41.748
PUTTING FOOD PACKAGING.

01:48:41.815 --> 01:48:43.516
INTO OUR WORK PLAN AND THE

01:48:43.583 --> 01:48:44.417
SUBSEQUENT WORK PLAN.

01:48:44.484 --> 01:48:45.819
THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE THE

01:48:45.886 --> 01:48:47.220
SECOND PETITION WE RECEIVED

01:48:47.287 --> 01:48:49.022
ACTUALLY CAME FROM THE

01:48:49.089 --> 01:48:50.557
CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION ARE THE

01:48:50.624 --> 01:48:51.858
CALIFORNIA.

01:48:51.925 --> 01:48:53.960
STORM WATER QUALITY ASSOCIATION

01:48:54.027 --> 01:48:56.162
KASKA AND THAT WAS TO PETITION

01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:58.665
FOR ZINC IN TIRES --

01:48:58.732 --> 01:48:59.799
THERE ARE WATER BODIES IN

01:48:59.866 --> 01:49:00.800
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE

01:49:00.867 --> 01:49:02.836
GOING TO BE IMPAIRED OR ARE

01:49:02.903 --> 01:49:04.905
ALREADY IMPAIRED FOR ZINC.

01:49:04.971 --> 01:49:07.007
AND TIRES ARE ONCE OF ONE SOURCE

01:49:07.073 --> 01:49:08.108
THAT -- IS

01:49:08.174 --> 01:49:09.876
POTENTIALLY RIGHT FOR INNOVATION

01:49:09.943 --> 01:49:12.879
AND SO WE'RE STILL WE'RE WORKING

01:49:12.946 --> 01:49:14.014
WITH THAT PETITIONER DAVE

01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:15.215
COMMITTED TO GIVING US

01:49:15.282 --> 01:49:17.083
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION LATER

01:49:17.150 --> 01:49:18.018
THIS SPRING.

01:49:18.084 --> 01:49:20.020
AND AFTER SHORTLY AFTER THAT I

01:49:20.086 --> 01:49:21.454
THINK WILL MAKE A DECISION ABOUT

01:49:21.521 --> 01:49:23.023
THAT PETITION ANOTHER USE THOSE

01:49:23.089 --> 01:49:24.391
TIRES TO MAKE ARTIFICIAL TURF

01:49:24.457 --> 01:49:25.992
THE PEOPLE PUT IN THEIR YARDS

01:49:26.059 --> 01:49:28.495
THEIR KIDS TO PLAN YEAH THAT'S A

01:49:28.561 --> 01:49:29.496
FROM.

01:49:29.562 --> 01:49:30.931
THE LASTLY DO YOU GIVE THOUGHT

01:49:30.997 --> 01:49:35.268
TO THE SAFETY OF PRODUCTS WHEN

01:49:35.335 --> 01:49:36.436
THEY'RE YOU WHEN THEY ARE.

01:49:36.503 --> 01:49:37.103
PUT INTO EXTRAORDINARY

01:49:37.170 --> 01:49:37.804
CIRCUMSTANCES SO I'M THINKING OF

01:49:37.871 --> 01:49:38.738
NUMBER ONE THE NUMBER OF

01:49:38.805 --> 01:49:40.540
PRODUCTS NOW THAT HAVE BEEN

01:49:40.607 --> 01:49:42.075
INVOLVED IN FOREST FIRES.

01:49:42.142 --> 01:49:44.344
SO HOMESTHAT HAD CHEMICALS THAT

01:49:44.411 --> 01:49:46.112
MAYBE NOBODY ANTICIPATED BEING

01:49:46.179 --> 01:49:47.747
INCINERATED BUT THE KNOWER AND

01:49:47.814 --> 01:49:49.282
SISTER INSERTED IN TURN INTO

01:49:49.349 --> 01:49:50.817
ACTION OR BREATHED.

01:49:50.884 --> 01:49:52.852
AND SEX OR PRODUCTS THAT END UP

01:49:52.919 --> 01:49:56.756
IN A OUR FLOOD PRONE AREAS IS

01:49:56.823 --> 01:49:57.857
THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU GIVE

01:49:57.924 --> 01:49:59.659
CONSIDERATION TO BECAUSE THOSE

01:49:59.726 --> 01:50:01.061
END UP --

01:50:01.127 --> 01:50:03.029
YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY --

01:50:03.096 --> 01:50:04.864
NOT THAT I'M COMMONLY I'M HAVING

01:50:04.931 --> 01:50:08.435
THOSE KINDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND

01:50:08.501 --> 01:50:10.036
YOU KNOW I WE'VE READ ABOUT YOU

01:50:10.103 --> 01:50:11.504
KNOW THE HURRICANES IN THE SOUTH

01:50:11.571 --> 01:50:13.406
AND THIS TOXIC BREW THAT YOU

01:50:13.473 --> 01:50:14.674
KNOW WILL BE MAKES THE ENTIRE

01:50:14.741 --> 01:50:15.909
STATE TOXIC.

01:50:15.976 --> 01:50:17.110
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE

01:50:17.177 --> 01:50:18.611
GIVING ANY THOUGHT.

01:50:18.678 --> 01:50:20.280
TO I WOULD SAY WE WE HAVEN'T

01:50:20.347 --> 01:50:21.181
SINGLE THAT OUT MADE OUT OF

01:50:21.247 --> 01:50:23.450
FOCUS OF OUR EFFORTS HOWEVER

01:50:23.516 --> 01:50:24.584
THERE ARE A COUPLE CASES WHERE

01:50:24.651 --> 01:50:26.019
THAT THAT KIND OF CONSIDERATION

01:50:26.086 --> 01:50:27.721
IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WITH

01:50:27.787 --> 01:50:29.022
THE FLAME RETARDANTS.

01:50:29.089 --> 01:50:29.856
THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT

01:50:29.923 --> 01:50:32.492
FIREFIGHTERS ARE SUFFERING FROM.

01:50:32.559 --> 01:50:33.994
SOME OF THE THE REPERCUSSIONS

01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:35.295
FROM BEING EXPOSED TO THOSE

01:50:35.362 --> 01:50:36.997
FLAME RETARDANTS AND OTHER

01:50:37.063 --> 01:50:39.299
CHEMICALS ALSO IN AS THEY FIGHT

01:50:39.366 --> 01:50:40.734
FIRES -- AND

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:41.901
SO THAT THAT GOES INTO THE

01:50:41.968 --> 01:50:44.604
CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN --

01:50:44.671 --> 01:50:45.739
CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE

01:50:45.805 --> 01:50:47.107
BUT THAT HAS NOT BEEN A FOCUS

01:50:47.173 --> 01:50:49.175
BUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT DGSE IS

01:50:49.242 --> 01:50:51.111
THE FIRST DEPARTMENT THAT GOES

01:50:51.177 --> 01:50:53.446
IN TO ALL OF THE FROM WILDFIRES

01:50:53.513 --> 01:50:54.147
SITES.

01:50:54.214 --> 01:50:55.515
AND EXPECTS WHETHER OR NOT THERE

01:50:55.582 --> 01:50:56.750
ARE HAZARDOUS WASTE ON THOSE

01:50:56.816 --> 01:50:58.885
SITES WE KNOW HOW MUCH HAZARDOUS

01:50:58.952 --> 01:51:00.086
WASTE ISN'T IN.

01:51:00.153 --> 01:51:02.989
ANY GIVEN HOUSEHOLD AND IT'S A

01:51:03.056 --> 01:51:06.559
TREMENDOUS FOR CHEMICALS.

01:51:06.626 --> 01:51:08.762
WOULD CERTAINLY BE IDEAL WELL

01:51:08.828 --> 01:51:10.030
I'LL JUST CONCLUDE BY SAYING I

01:51:10.096 --> 01:51:12.132
HOPE THAT WE CAN ACCELERATE YOUR

01:51:12.198 --> 01:51:13.366
WORK AND THAT WE CAN SEE A

01:51:13.433 --> 01:51:15.168
GREATER BODY OF WORK PRODUCT OUT

01:51:15.235 --> 01:51:16.469
OF IT -- I

01:51:16.536 --> 01:51:17.804
THINK THAT THE PEOPLE IN

01:51:17.871 --> 01:51:19.039
CALIFORNIA.

01:51:19.105 --> 01:51:19.906
ASSUME THAT THIS IS ALREADY

01:51:19.973 --> 01:51:21.174
HAPPENING AND A LOT OF THEM WILL

01:51:21.241 --> 01:51:22.609
BE SURPRISED TO KNOW.

01:51:22.675 --> 01:51:24.177
HOW MANY INCREDIBLY HAZARDOUS

01:51:24.244 --> 01:51:25.545
MATERIALS THEY THEY AND THEIR

01:51:25.612 --> 01:51:27.981
CHILDREN INTERACT WITH ON A

01:51:28.048 --> 01:51:29.516
DAILY BASIS AND --

01:51:29.582 --> 01:51:31.518
SO IF WE CAN BE AT ALL HELPFUL

01:51:31.584 --> 01:51:32.952
YOU KNOW I'D LOVE. TO TO BE PART

01:51:33.019 --> 01:51:36.189
OF OF CHANGING THAT EQUATION

01:51:36.256 --> 01:51:39.325
THANK YOU THANK.

YOU'VE GOT A HEART HEART OF A

01:51:43.463 --> 01:51:44.964
LOT OF THE MATTERS THAT.

01:51:45.031 --> 01:51:46.232
ARE THE REASON WE'RE HOLDING

OR AMBIGUITY EVEN IF THEY'RE

01:52:19.766 --> 01:52:22.035
ALREADY ABOUT DISCLOSURE OF THE

01:52:22.102 --> 01:52:23.903
USE OF CHEMICALS IN CERTAIN

01:52:23.970 --> 01:52:25.572
PRODUCTS THAT WAS GOING BACK

01:52:25.638 --> 01:52:27.240
THROUGH THE ORIGINALLY BE

01:52:27.307 --> 01:52:28.908
EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE IN.

01:52:28.975 --> 01:52:31.478
I MEAN IT'S IT'S I WOULD THINK

01:52:31.544 --> 01:52:34.047
THE THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR'S

01:52:34.114 --> 01:52:35.782
ORIGINALLY WOULD BE ABLE TO I

01:52:35.849 --> 01:52:37.383
MEAN EVEN IS HERE IT SAYS THAT.

01:52:37.450 --> 01:52:38.818
YOU CAN YOU KNOW COLLECT THE

01:52:38.885 --> 01:52:40.687
INFORMATION NECESSARY TO ADOPT

01:52:40.753 --> 01:52:42.755
THE REGULATIONS AND WHAT HAVE

01:52:42.822 --> 01:52:44.023
YOU JUST TELL US A LITTLE MORE

01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:45.158
ABOUT THAT STORY OF TRYING TO

01:52:45.225 --> 01:52:46.993
GET SOME OF THIS DATA FROM

01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:49.229
INDUSTRY AND BARRIERS YOU FACE

01:52:49.295 --> 01:52:50.530
IS THERE BEEN LITIGATION ON THIS

01:52:50.597 --> 01:52:51.798
ISSUE WE HAVEN'T HAD LITIGATION

01:52:51.865 --> 01:52:52.732
OKAY.

01:52:52.799 --> 01:52:55.602
BUT I'M GONNA LET --

01:52:55.668 --> 01:52:57.670
MISTER PALMER STICK TO THAT.

01:52:57.737 --> 01:52:58.605
SURE I THINK --

01:52:58.671 --> 01:52:59.539
YOU KNOW ARE STAFF WORK HARD TO

01:52:59.606 --> 01:53:01.007
GET INFORMATION FROM A WIDE

01:53:01.074 --> 01:53:02.041
VARIETY OF SOURCES YEAH YOU KNOW

01:53:02.108 --> 01:53:03.009
PUBLIC DATABASES ARE COLLEAGUES

01:53:03.076 --> 01:53:04.477
AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

01:53:04.544 --> 01:53:05.812
AND THE INDUSTRY'S THEMSELVES

01:53:05.879 --> 01:53:07.247
THE MANUFACTURE AND OFTEN WE GET

01:53:07.313 --> 01:53:09.115
A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION.

01:53:09.182 --> 01:53:10.817
BUT OFTEN.

01:53:10.884 --> 01:53:13.019
THEY'RE THE THERE'S AN

01:53:13.086 --> 01:53:15.388
UNWILLINGNESS TO GIVE US

01:53:15.455 --> 01:53:16.923
MULTIPLE SAID STEPHEN SOME OF

01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:18.224
THE MANUFACTURERS OF PRODUCTS.

01:53:18.291 --> 01:53:19.759
DON'T ENTIRELY KNOW ALL THE

01:53:19.826 --> 01:53:21.227
CHEMICALS IN THEIR PRODUCTS

01:53:21.294 --> 01:53:23.263
BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEX AND LONG

01:53:23.329 --> 01:53:25.365
SUPPLY CHAINS SO --

01:53:25.431 --> 01:53:26.933
WE DON'T HAVE DIRECT AUTHORITY

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.101
TO REQUEST.

01:53:28.168 --> 01:53:29.636
THAT INFORMATION AND HAVE THEM

01:53:29.702 --> 01:53:31.371
RESPOND TO US AND GIVE IT TO US

01:53:31.437 --> 01:53:34.107
AS A REQUIREMENT WE HAVE A FORTY

01:53:34.174 --> 01:53:34.874
REQUESTED.

01:53:34.941 --> 01:53:37.110
AND THEY CAN SAY THANK YOU BUT

01:53:37.177 --> 01:53:38.511
WE'RE NOT GONNA GIVE IT TO YOU

01:53:38.578 --> 01:53:41.181
OR WHAT HAPPENS THEN THAT YOU

01:53:41.247 --> 01:53:41.981
SAY.

01:53:42.048 --> 01:53:44.350
PLEASE THEY SAY NO THANK YOU

01:53:44.417 --> 01:53:46.719
THEN YOU SAY OKAY I MEAN IS THAT

01:53:46.786 --> 01:53:47.921
WHAT YOU'RE LEFT WITH IS THERE

01:53:47.987 --> 01:53:49.189
NO WAY TO COMPEL.

01:53:49.255 --> 01:53:50.957
WHAT DISCLOSURE WHAT WE CAN DO

01:53:51.024 --> 01:53:52.492
AT THAT POINT IS WE CAN SAY?

01:53:52.559 --> 01:53:54.227
WE CAN TELL THE PUBLIC THAT THIS

01:53:54.294 --> 01:53:55.428
COMPANY CHOSE NOT TO SHARE

01:53:55.495 --> 01:53:57.363
INFORMATION WITH US THAT'S WHAT

01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:57.664
WE CAN DO.

01:53:57.730 --> 01:53:59.465
AND IS THAT OCCURRED WE HAVE NOT

01:53:59.532 --> 01:54:00.934
DONE IT YET WE HAVE HAD

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.435
OCCASIONS WHERE --

01:54:02.502 --> 01:54:04.704
WE WERE ASSURED THAT INFORMATION

01:54:04.771 --> 01:54:05.905
WAS FORTHCOMING --

01:54:05.972 --> 01:54:08.141
REPEATEDLY AND WE HAVE NOT

01:54:08.208 --> 01:54:09.909
RECEIVED SO SO HOW COMMON IS

01:54:09.976 --> 01:54:11.177
LIKE HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU THINK

01:54:11.244 --> 01:54:14.113
YOU'VE BEEN DENIED REQUESTS FOR

01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:16.516
INFORMATION [inaudible]

01:54:16.583 --> 01:54:17.684
SOME YEARS.

01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:18.551
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW THE

01:54:18.618 --> 01:54:19.185
NUMBER OF TIMES WE'VE ACTUALLY

01:54:19.252 --> 01:54:20.653
BEEN DENIED I THINK THAT THE THE

01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:23.556
BIGGER PROBLEM THIS IS FINDING --

01:54:23.623 --> 01:54:25.425
AS SOMEONE WHO CAN TELL US WHAT

01:54:25.491 --> 01:54:27.460
THEY KNOW AND IS WILLING TO GIVE

01:54:27.527 --> 01:54:29.996
US THE INFORMATION SO --

01:54:30.063 --> 01:54:31.531
ON ONE HAND WE DO HAVE THIS CALL

01:54:31.598 --> 01:54:32.999
AN AUTHORITY THAT WHERE WE CAN

01:54:33.066 --> 01:54:33.866
ASKING IF IT'S NOT CAN WE CAN

01:54:33.933 --> 01:54:35.401
KIND OF PUBLICLY SAY THAT WE

01:54:35.468 --> 01:54:37.937
WERE GIVEN IT BUT IT'S TYPICALLY

01:54:38.004 --> 01:54:39.172
MORE.

01:54:39.239 --> 01:54:40.006
OF A CHALLENGE OF GETTING THE

01:54:40.073 --> 01:54:43.209
INFORMATION FROM --

01:54:43.276 --> 01:54:44.944
IN THIS ACCURATE AND DETAILED

01:54:45.011 --> 01:54:46.613
ENOUGH SO WE MIGHT GET GENERAL

01:54:46.679 --> 01:54:47.947
INFORMATION BUT WE DON'T HAVE

01:54:48.014 --> 01:54:50.917
FOR EXAMPLE ENOUGH INFORMATION.

01:54:50.984 --> 01:54:51.517
TO TO DO ALL OF OUR WORK WE

01:54:51.584 --> 01:54:53.052
MIGHT SAY THERE IS THIS CHEMICAL

01:54:53.119 --> 01:54:53.987
NEVER WE DON'T OF THE

01:54:54.053 --> 01:54:55.955
CONCENTRATION THAT CHEMICAL WAR

01:54:56.022 --> 01:54:57.991
WE MIGHT KNOW CLASS OF CHEMICALS

01:54:58.057 --> 01:54:59.959
OR IN THE CASE OF SAY FRAGRANCES --

01:55:00.026 --> 01:55:00.893
THAT INFORMATION OFTEN THE

01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:02.495
MANUFACTURE DOESN'T KNOW BECAUSE

01:55:02.562 --> 01:55:04.163
THE FRAGRANCE HOUSES KEEP THAT

01:55:04.230 --> 01:55:05.898
INFORMATION VERY CLOSE --

01:55:05.965 --> 01:55:07.533
REGARDED AND THE MANUFACTURE MAY

01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:11.904
NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT CHEMICALS ARE

01:55:11.971 --> 01:55:14.941
IN THAT FRAGMENTS THEMSELVES SO.

01:55:15.008 --> 01:55:15.975
THERE'S A LOT OF LAYERS AND NAME

01:55:16.042 --> 01:55:17.010
IT MEAN DO THEY CLAIM THEY'RE

01:55:17.076 --> 01:55:19.178
CONTRACTUALLY BOUND NOT TO EVEN

01:55:19.245 --> 01:55:20.380
KNOW THAT THEY LIKE THEIR THEIR

01:55:20.446 --> 01:55:21.047
AGREEMENT WITH SAY THE FRAGRANCE

01:55:21.114 --> 01:55:21.748
HOUSE WOULDN'T ALLOW THEM TO SEE

01:55:21.814 --> 01:55:23.950
THAT BECAUSE ITS PROPRIETARY AND

01:55:24.017 --> 01:55:24.550
THAT KIND ARGUMENT.

01:55:24.617 --> 01:55:25.184
YES BUT THERE I MEAN WE DO WITH

01:55:25.251 --> 01:55:26.286
CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS

01:55:26.352 --> 01:55:27.120
INFORMATION AND MANY OTHER

01:55:27.186 --> 01:55:28.354
CONTACTS AND GOVERNMENT RIGHT I

01:55:28.421 --> 01:55:30.523
MEAN WE'VE DEALT WITH THAT KIND

01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:31.057
OF DATA.

01:55:31.124 --> 01:55:32.158
IN ALL.

01:55:32.225 --> 01:55:33.960
OIL MARKETS IN YOU KNOW THE

01:55:34.027 --> 01:55:36.262
FRACKING INDUSTRY IN ALL KINDS

01:55:36.329 --> 01:55:40.233
OF SECTORS BUT SO WHY IS THIS

01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:43.202
DIFFERENT.

01:55:43.269 --> 01:55:45.138
WELL YOU'RE YOU'RE THE TO THE

01:55:45.204 --> 01:55:46.906
COMPANY LET ME JUST INTERRUPT.

01:55:46.973 --> 01:55:47.607
A DOCTOR SOLOMON WILL BE

01:55:47.674 --> 01:55:48.508
SPEAKING AND ONE OF THEIR

01:55:48.574 --> 01:55:49.175
RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:55:49.242 --> 01:55:51.311
ARE OF THE PANEL THAT LOOKED AT

01:55:51.377 --> 01:55:52.645
THIS IS THAT WE GIVE THE

01:55:52.712 --> 01:55:56.149
DEPARTMENT MORE AUTHORITY.

01:55:56.215 --> 01:55:59.619
BY --

01:55:59.686 --> 01:56:00.453
THEY'RE BRINGING UP EVEN IF YOU

01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:02.288
GIVE THEM THAT ADDITIONAL

01:56:02.355 --> 01:56:02.588
AUTHORITY.

01:56:02.655 --> 01:56:03.623
THEY MAY BE ABLE TO FIND THE

01:56:03.690 --> 01:56:04.490
RIGHT PERSON TO TELL THEM BUT

01:56:04.557 --> 01:56:06.392
THAT IS ONE OF THE REFORMS TO

01:56:06.459 --> 01:56:07.627
WE'RE LOOKING AT WHICH OF COURSE

01:56:07.694 --> 01:56:09.028
ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN BROUGHT

01:56:09.095 --> 01:56:10.063
UP AS WELL.

01:56:10.129 --> 01:56:11.331
AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE REALLY

01:56:11.397 --> 01:56:12.932
NEED TO WORK ON AND I'M PRETTY

01:56:12.999 --> 01:56:14.100
SURE WE WELL.

01:56:14.167 --> 01:56:16.869
I DON'T KNOW SOMEONE HAS A BILL

01:56:16.936 --> 01:56:20.006
TO THAT EFFECT YET.

01:56:20.073 --> 01:56:22.208
HI GENDER ALLEN HAS A BILL TO

01:56:22.275 --> 01:56:23.976
THAT EFFECT ALREADY.

01:56:24.043 --> 01:56:24.610
IS OUT I MIGHT GOOD ENDED THAT

01:56:24.677 --> 01:56:25.678
LINE OF QUESTIONING BECAUSE IT

01:56:25.745 --> 01:56:26.813
SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS ARE FOUR

01:56:26.879 --> 01:56:28.948
STEPS AHEAD OF ME THAT'S VERY

01:56:29.015 --> 01:56:30.283
GOOD NEWS --

01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:33.119
THE I JUST WANTED BRIEFLY ASK

01:56:33.186 --> 01:56:34.954
ABOUT THAT --

01:56:35.021 --> 01:56:35.855
THE THIS NOTION OF INNOVATION

01:56:35.922 --> 01:56:38.458
AND THE LACK OF NEW I. P. AND

01:56:38.524 --> 01:56:40.393
SORT OF VENTURE CAPITAL POURING

01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:42.261
INTO ALTERNATIVE CHEMICALS SAFER

01:56:42.328 --> 01:56:43.363
CHEMICALS --

01:56:43.429 --> 01:56:45.832
I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF OR

01:56:45.898 --> 01:56:48.267
ADVANCED ENERGY RESEARCH IN THIS

01:56:48.334 --> 01:56:50.136
STATE --

01:56:50.203 --> 01:56:51.471
CERTAINLY EVEN FEDERALLY THERE'S

01:56:51.537 --> 01:56:53.539
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY WE SPEND

01:56:53.606 --> 01:56:55.742
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR --

01:56:55.808 --> 01:56:57.944
YOU KNOW RP AND IS THERE ARE

01:56:58.010 --> 01:56:59.278
THERE ANY BEST PRACTICES OUT

01:56:59.345 --> 01:57:01.114
THERE FOR FOLKS WHO ARE DOING

01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:03.449
THE KINDS OF CHALLENGE GRANT

01:57:03.516 --> 01:57:06.085
STORER INNOVATION PRIZES THAT

01:57:06.152 --> 01:57:07.754
THAT WE COULD BE LOOKING TO

01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:09.322
MAYBE IT FOR PRESIDENT THERE IS

01:57:09.389 --> 01:57:10.356
IS.

01:57:10.423 --> 01:57:12.091
KIND OF UNCHARTED TERRITORY --

01:57:12.158 --> 01:57:13.359
I I DO THINK DOCTOR MALL THE

01:57:13.426 --> 01:57:14.093
WHOLE PROBABLY KNOWS THAT

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:15.328
LANDSCAPE A LITTLE BETTER THAN

01:57:15.395 --> 01:57:17.597
WE DO HOWEVER I WOULD SAY THAT

01:57:17.663 --> 01:57:18.898
USEPA.

01:57:18.965 --> 01:57:20.833
HAD A GREEN CHEMISTRY AWARDS

01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:23.069
PROGRAM WHICH I BELIEVE IS

01:57:23.136 --> 01:57:24.270
DISCONTINUED.

01:57:24.337 --> 01:57:27.440
THIS IS A DISCONTINUED DOES

01:57:27.507 --> 01:57:32.178
ANYBODY.

01:57:32.245 --> 01:57:33.846
YEAH IS THERE WAS NO MY MONEY

01:57:33.913 --> 01:57:35.381
ASSOCIATED WITH BUT UNDER THIS

01:57:35.448 --> 01:57:36.349
IMAGE IT'S ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO

01:57:36.416 --> 01:57:36.949
BE TOO EXCITED BUT IT REALLY

01:57:37.016 --> 01:57:37.984
WHAT DID A GREAT JOB OF

01:57:38.050 --> 01:57:38.851
HIGHLIGHTING AND SORRY AGAIN A

01:57:38.918 --> 01:57:39.652
NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA COMPANIES

01:57:39.719 --> 01:57:40.386
THAT HAD BEEN.

01:57:40.453 --> 01:57:42.255
INNOVATING AND MOVING AWAY FROM

01:57:42.321 --> 01:57:43.456
TOXIC CHEMICALS.

01:57:43.523 --> 01:57:45.892
GOT IT AND THAT SO THAT THAT WAS

01:57:45.958 --> 01:57:48.861
AN AYE USEPA.

01:57:48.928 --> 01:57:52.632
GRANT SURPRISE PROGRAM AS SOME

01:57:52.698 --> 01:57:53.433
SORT.

01:57:53.499 --> 01:57:54.100
AND IF YOU LOOKED AT ANY OTHER

01:57:54.167 --> 01:57:56.135
EXISTING INNOVATION FUNDING THAT

01:57:56.202 --> 01:57:57.904
MEAN LIKE I'M I'M THINKING IT'S

01:57:57.970 --> 01:57:58.538
HARD OF THE STEPS TO GREENHOUSE

01:57:58.604 --> 01:58:00.139
GAS NEXUS HERE BUT YOU KNOW WE

01:58:00.206 --> 01:58:00.339
HAVE.

01:58:00.406 --> 01:58:01.607
EVEN OPR IS DOING RESEARCH AND

01:58:01.674 --> 01:58:04.110
DEVELOPMENT GRANTS --

01:58:04.177 --> 01:58:08.281
JUST TRYING TO THINK THE SMOKE

01:58:08.347 --> 01:58:08.948
AND OF INNOVATION BUT IT'S AN A

01:58:09.015 --> 01:58:10.249
CYCLOTRON ROAD WHICH IS A

01:58:10.316 --> 01:58:12.652
PARTNERSHIP THAT ARE WITH RP

01:58:12.718 --> 01:58:13.719
THEIR THERE --

01:58:13.786 --> 01:58:14.954
THEIR THEIR MAINLY FOCUS AND

01:58:15.021 --> 01:58:16.823
ENERGY BUT I KNOW THEY'RE DOING

01:58:16.889 --> 01:58:17.356
SOME MATERIAL SCIENCE AND

01:58:17.423 --> 01:58:18.324
CHEMISTRY.

01:58:18.391 --> 01:58:20.293
THERE AS WELL WITH THE NATIONAL

01:58:20.359 --> 01:58:22.662
LABS.

01:58:22.728 --> 01:58:23.830
ANYWHERE ELSE.

01:58:23.896 --> 01:58:25.465
TO ON YOUR MIND.

01:58:25.531 --> 01:58:26.098
WELL YOU KNOW.

01:58:26.165 --> 01:58:27.033
WE DON'T LOOK A LOT OF THAT

01:58:27.099 --> 01:58:29.135
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A RESOURCE --

01:58:29.202 --> 01:58:30.470
TO GIVE PEOPLE OR YOU TO I WOULD

01:58:30.536 --> 01:58:31.304
POINT OUT THAT IN OUR

01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:33.072
REGULATIONS ONCE WE GO THROUGH

01:58:33.139 --> 01:58:34.874
THE PROCESS AFTER WE'VE REVIEWED

01:58:34.941 --> 01:58:36.509
ON ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS IF WE

01:58:36.576 --> 01:58:38.344
FEEL THAT --

01:58:38.411 --> 01:58:39.111
THERE'S NO MOVEMENT TOWARDS A

01:58:39.178 --> 01:58:40.613
CITY -- FOR

01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:42.715
ALTERNATIVE AND THERE IS AN AREA

01:58:42.782 --> 01:58:44.016
OF RESEARCH NEEDED WE HAVE THE

01:58:44.083 --> 01:58:46.052
AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE A WE CALL

01:58:46.118 --> 01:58:47.286
REGULATORY RESPONSE WE WOULD.

01:58:47.353 --> 01:58:48.588
ASK.

01:58:48.654 --> 01:58:50.389
FOR THE MANY FACTORS TO FUND A

01:58:50.456 --> 01:58:51.324
CHALLENGE GRANT THAT WOULD HELP

01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:52.892
FILL SOME OF THIS DATA GAPS THAT

01:58:52.959 --> 01:58:53.593
COULD MOVE.

01:58:53.659 --> 01:58:55.695
THE GREEN CHEMISTRY SOLUTIONS

01:58:55.761 --> 01:58:59.131
AND INNOVATION FOR CHOOSE THE

01:58:59.198 --> 01:59:01.067
FASTER YOU HAVE ONLY AUTHORITY

01:59:01.133 --> 01:59:05.104
HAVE YET SO WE HAVE A GOVERNOR

01:59:05.171 --> 01:59:07.039
IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S GOT.

01:59:07.106 --> 01:59:08.975
OKAY A THANK YOU MISTER THANK

01:59:09.041 --> 01:59:09.742
YOU SENATOR HE BREAK UPS THE

01:59:09.809 --> 01:59:10.977
EXCELLENT QUESTIONS AND WE WILL

01:59:11.043 --> 01:59:13.045
BE LOOKING AT THE BUDGET.

01:59:13.112 --> 01:59:15.114
LATER ON WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT

01:59:15.181 --> 01:59:16.883
TOGETHER --

01:59:16.949 --> 01:59:18.117
SO -- DOCTOR

01:59:18.184 --> 01:59:19.852
WILLIAMS I HAVE A QUESTION

01:59:19.919 --> 01:59:21.921
MYSELF.

01:59:21.988 --> 01:59:24.056
MR SOMEONE ELSE HAS A QUESTION

01:59:24.123 --> 01:59:27.093
FIRST OKAY GO AHEAD.

01:59:27.159 --> 01:59:28.194
I ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARRIAGE

01:59:28.261 --> 01:59:29.495
EIICHI THANK YOU I TRY TO FOLLOW

01:59:29.562 --> 01:59:30.530
UP BUT A DOCTOR WILLIAMS ON YOUR

01:59:30.596 --> 01:59:31.397
RESPONSE.

01:59:31.464 --> 01:59:32.698
TO MISS FRIEDMAN'S QUESTION

01:59:32.765 --> 01:59:33.766
ABOUT.

01:59:33.833 --> 01:59:35.668
TO YOU KNOW HOW WE'RE OFTEN TOLD --

01:59:35.735 --> 01:59:37.603
WITH WHAT YOU CHARACTERIZES THE

01:59:37.670 --> 01:59:38.938
THE WHACK A MOLE APPROACH --

01:59:39.005 --> 01:59:40.673
THAT -- THAT

01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:42.108
THAT WE SHOULD DEFER TO THE

01:59:42.174 --> 01:59:44.343
GREEN CHEMISTRY PROCESS AND YET

01:59:44.410 --> 01:59:46.345
THERE IS THIS TREMENDOUS BACKLOG --

01:59:46.412 --> 01:59:48.648
AND IT AND I I I THINK BECAUSE I

01:59:48.714 --> 01:59:51.484
HEARD YOU SAY THAT.

01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:53.386
THEIR THEIR BRAIN MAY BE.

01:59:53.452 --> 01:59:54.287
SITUATIONS WHERE THE LEGISLATURE

01:59:54.353 --> 01:59:57.290
SHOULD PURSUE ALTERNATIVE

01:59:57.356 --> 01:59:59.792
ANALYSES AND I WASN'T SURE IF

01:59:59.859 --> 02:00:00.459
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LAWS OF

02:00:00.526 --> 02:00:01.193
NATURE.

02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:01.727
THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN A

02:00:01.794 --> 02:00:04.530
REGULATIONS SO THAT IF THE IF

02:00:04.597 --> 02:00:06.332
THE LEGISLATURE'S CONCERNED.

02:00:06.399 --> 02:00:07.867
ABOUT SOMETHING THEY CAN ASK US

02:00:07.934 --> 02:00:10.836
TO LOOK INTO WOULD RUN THROUGH

02:00:10.903 --> 02:00:11.971
OUR PROCESSES NORMAL.

02:00:12.038 --> 02:00:13.739
SO FOR INSTANCE WE WERE ASKED TO

02:00:13.806 --> 02:00:14.840
LOOK AT LEAD ACID BATTERIES AND

02:00:14.907 --> 02:00:16.075
WE'RE DOING AN EVALUATION OF

02:00:16.142 --> 02:00:17.410
LEAD ACID BATTERIES --

02:00:17.476 --> 02:00:19.145
SO THAT'S ONE WAY TO FEED

02:00:19.211 --> 02:00:21.914
PRODUCTS INTO OUR WORK IF THE

02:00:21.981 --> 02:00:23.049
LEGISLATURE THINKS THAT ARE

02:00:23.115 --> 02:00:24.784
ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS WOULD BE

02:00:24.850 --> 02:00:26.619
BENEFICIAL AND AND SO ARE YOU

02:00:26.686 --> 02:00:29.622
ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT --

02:00:29.689 --> 02:00:32.224
OF WHO WE WENT TO INDIVIDUAL

02:00:32.291 --> 02:00:32.858
LESS LETTER --

02:00:32.925 --> 02:00:34.293
BE OF THE REQUESTEDALTERMAN

02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:35.928
ELSE'S ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT YOU

02:00:35.995 --> 02:00:36.429
KNOW -- A

02:00:36.495 --> 02:00:38.297
BILL HAVING TO BE PASSED IN

02:00:38.364 --> 02:00:39.899
ORDER TO HAVE QUESTIONS WILL

02:00:39.966 --> 02:00:41.567
WANT WE PROVIDE IN A PETITION

02:00:41.634 --> 02:00:42.401
PROCESS --

02:00:42.468 --> 02:00:44.170
BIAS IF AND IF WE ARE ASKED FOR

02:00:44.236 --> 02:00:45.304
ANOTHER STATE AGENCY OR THE

02:00:45.371 --> 02:00:47.773
LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR.

02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:51.544
TO LOOK AT A SPECIFIC PART

02:00:51.611 --> 02:00:53.212
PRODUCT OR YOU COULD.

02:00:53.279 --> 02:00:54.747
LEGISLATURE DID WITH LEAD ACID

02:00:54.814 --> 02:00:57.483
BATTERIES AND GOVERNOR BROWN'S --

02:00:57.550 --> 02:00:58.851
DESIRES AS WELL CITY SO IF A

02:00:58.918 --> 02:00:59.619
INDIVIDUAL --

02:00:59.685 --> 02:01:00.886
THE LEGISLATOR MADE TO REQUEST

02:01:00.953 --> 02:01:01.721
THE YOU WOULD EXPEDITE THE

02:01:01.787 --> 02:01:02.855
REQUEST AS AN ALTERNATE

02:01:02.922 --> 02:01:06.525
ANNOUNCES.

02:01:06.592 --> 02:01:07.793
WHAT WE'D BE DOING IS EXPEDITING

02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:09.161
THE DECISION ABOUT LISTING IT AS

02:01:09.228 --> 02:01:10.363
A PRIORITY PRODUCT WHICH THEN

02:01:10.429 --> 02:01:12.031
WOULD TRIGGER THE ALTERNATIVES

02:01:12.098 --> 02:01:12.298
ANALYSIS?

02:01:12.365 --> 02:01:14.066
SO [inaudible]

02:01:14.133 --> 02:01:18.471
IT'S BUT I WOULD I WOULD POINT

02:01:18.537 --> 02:01:19.305
TO THE BILL THAT --

02:01:19.372 --> 02:01:20.806
REMOVE THAT PROHIBITED CAN'T

02:01:20.873 --> 02:01:22.441
CLAIM RETARDANTS IN CHILDREN'S

02:01:22.508 --> 02:01:23.643
PRODUCTS LAST YEAR.

02:01:23.709 --> 02:01:24.076
THAT'S NOT IN ANYWAY

02:01:24.143 --> 02:01:26.879
CONTRADICTORY TO OUR REGULATIONS.

02:01:26.946 --> 02:01:28.914
YOU KNOW THAT'S IN SO MANY OF

02:01:28.981 --> 02:01:30.483
THOSE PRODUCTS THERE'S NO NEED

02:01:30.549 --> 02:01:31.484
THERE'S NO NECESSITY TO HAVE

02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:32.918
THOSE FLAME RETARDANTS SO IT

02:01:32.985 --> 02:01:34.387
MAKES PERFECT SENSE FOR THE

02:01:34.453 --> 02:01:38.257
LEGISLATURE TO TAKE ACTION. TO

02:01:38.324 --> 02:01:40.960
BAN IT YEAH.

02:01:41.027 --> 02:01:41.627
OKAY.

02:01:41.694 --> 02:01:45.264
OKAY -- SO.

02:01:45.331 --> 02:01:46.198
YOU MENTIONED --

02:01:46.265 --> 02:01:47.466
BY THE WAY AT SO YOU'VE ADDED

02:01:47.533 --> 02:01:48.134
EIGHT PEOPLE HOW MANY PEOPLE DID

02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:51.237
YOU HAVE PRIOR TO THAT THIRTY TO

02:01:51.303 --> 02:01:51.871
THIRTY TO SELL.

02:01:51.937 --> 02:01:54.073
THAT FORTY PEOPLE SO EIGHT IS

02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:56.542
NICE ADDITION BUT IT'S NOT A LOT

02:01:56.609 --> 02:01:57.343
OF PEOPLE.

02:01:57.410 --> 02:01:59.945
ARE ADDITIONAL TO WHAT YOU HAVE

02:02:00.012 --> 02:02:05.184
IT'S A 15% OR SELL --

02:02:05.251 --> 02:02:06.652
DON'T EXCUSE ME --

02:02:06.719 --> 02:02:08.254
25% ANYWAY.

02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:09.188
GOING -- TO

02:02:09.255 --> 02:02:13.559
P. FAST MUCH AGREES THAT ONE HAS

02:02:13.626 --> 02:02:19.498
TO LOOK AT GROUPS OF CHEMICALS --

02:02:19.565 --> 02:02:22.101
RATHER THAN TRYING AS YOU SAID --

02:02:22.168 --> 02:02:23.469
PLAYING WHACK A MOLE WITH ONE AT

02:02:23.536 --> 02:02:24.670
A TIME.

02:02:24.737 --> 02:02:26.372
AS WE WERE LOOKING AT P. FAST

02:02:26.439 --> 02:02:27.873
LAST YEAR.

02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:30.676
THERE WAS A GREAT CONSENSUS THAT

02:02:30.743 --> 02:02:33.279
THE LONG CHAINS --

02:02:33.345 --> 02:02:36.248
I THINK SIX CARBONS OR EIGHT

02:02:36.315 --> 02:02:37.783
EIGHT EIGHT CARBONS.

02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:40.619
AND MORE WERE DEFINITELY A

02:02:40.686 --> 02:02:42.455
CONCERN AND THEN THERE WAS A BIG

02:02:42.521 --> 02:02:46.225
DISPUTE ABOUT THE SHORTER CHAINS --

02:02:46.292 --> 02:02:48.761
AND I IT SUGGESTED THAT WE SEND

02:02:48.828 --> 02:02:51.630
IT TO YOU AS A REQUEST TO GIVE

02:02:51.697 --> 02:02:53.232
THAT PRIORITY IN TERMS OF

02:02:53.299 --> 02:02:55.568
LOOKING AT IT. FOR WHATEVER

02:02:55.634 --> 02:02:57.403
REASON THEN THEY'LL STOPPED IN

02:02:57.470 --> 02:02:59.138
THE SENATE I'M NOT QUITE SURE

02:02:59.205 --> 02:03:01.107
WHY -- BUT

02:03:01.173 --> 02:03:03.442
IN THAT CASE CAN'T.

02:03:03.509 --> 02:03:05.511
AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT P. FAST NOW

02:03:05.578 --> 02:03:07.012
IN.

02:03:07.079 --> 02:03:08.614
CARPETS ARE YOU LOOKING AFTER

02:03:08.681 --> 02:03:10.483
SHORT CHAINS SEPARATE FROM THE

02:03:10.549 --> 02:03:12.518
LONG CHAINS KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING

02:03:12.585 --> 02:03:14.320
AT THE MISS ONE CLASS RIGHT AND

02:03:14.386 --> 02:03:15.888
THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT.

02:03:15.955 --> 02:03:17.823
WE HAVE A SHORTHAND EXPRESSION

02:03:17.890 --> 02:03:20.126
IT'S ALL ROADS LEAD TO PERFORM --

02:03:20.192 --> 02:03:20.926
ALKYL ACIDS.

02:03:20.993 --> 02:03:25.731
THOSE AS THE PFA ETS AND THAT'S

02:03:25.798 --> 02:03:26.966
TO SAY THAT --

02:03:27.032 --> 02:03:29.268
THAT'S THE THAT IS THE SUBSET OF

02:03:29.335 --> 02:03:30.536
THE P. FAST FAMILY THAT'S THE

02:03:30.603 --> 02:03:33.806
MOST WELL CHARACTERIZED AND MOST

02:03:33.873 --> 02:03:35.174
WELL UNDERSTOOD TO HAVE TOXIC.

02:03:35.241 --> 02:03:36.509
EFFECTS.

02:03:36.575 --> 02:03:38.644
AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU LOOK AT

02:03:38.711 --> 02:03:40.613
THE OTHER SUBCLASSES THEY EITHER

02:03:40.679 --> 02:03:44.650
DEGRADED TO P. FAA'S OR PFA ETS

02:03:44.717 --> 02:03:46.218
ARE USED TO MANUFACTURE THEM.

02:03:46.285 --> 02:03:47.920
OR YOU KNOW THERE ARE THESE

02:03:47.987 --> 02:03:49.722
INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE

02:03:49.789 --> 02:03:51.457
CHEMICALS IN THE CLASS AND SO

02:03:51.524 --> 02:03:55.961
THE THE THE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

02:03:56.028 --> 02:03:58.063
THE PFA ETS.

02:03:58.130 --> 02:03:59.999
WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE A SAY.

02:04:00.065 --> 02:04:01.167
WE'RE WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WE

02:04:01.233 --> 02:04:01.801
NEED TO LOOK AT THIS AT THE AS A

02:04:01.867 --> 02:04:02.868
WHOLE CLASS.

02:04:02.935 --> 02:04:05.070
AND THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE

02:04:05.137 --> 02:04:07.039
LONG CHAINS AND THE SHORTER

02:04:07.106 --> 02:04:10.976
CHANGE IS IN SOME WAYS ARBITRARY

02:04:11.043 --> 02:04:12.578
YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S I THINK THE

02:04:12.645 --> 02:04:14.446
FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE LONG

02:04:14.513 --> 02:04:17.616
CHAINS ARE WELL CHARACTERIZED.

02:04:17.683 --> 02:04:19.218
RIGHT AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE KNOW.

02:04:19.285 --> 02:04:21.020
IT'S NOT THAT THE OTHERS ARE

02:04:21.086 --> 02:04:21.320
[inaudible]

02:04:21.387 --> 02:04:23.155
SAFER NECESSARILY I DON'T THINK

02:04:23.222 --> 02:04:25.191
THAT'S THE ANYBODY HAS CONCLUDED

02:04:25.257 --> 02:04:26.325
THAT IT'S JUST THAT THEY'RE NOT

02:04:26.392 --> 02:04:27.426
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN AS WIDELY

02:04:27.493 --> 02:04:29.128
CHARACTERIZED SO WE WANT TO

02:04:29.195 --> 02:04:30.729
PREVENT A CLAIM WAS THAT THEY

02:04:30.796 --> 02:04:33.532
DON'T ACCUMULATE AND PEOPLE.

02:04:33.599 --> 02:04:36.001
ARE AS THAT WAS THE CLIP THERE'D

02:04:36.068 --> 02:04:37.336
THAT IS A CLAIM BUT IF YOU LOOK

02:04:37.403 --> 02:04:39.538
AT THE CONSTANT EXPOSURE BECAUSE

02:04:39.605 --> 02:04:41.974
THESE CHEMICALS STICK AROUND

02:04:42.041 --> 02:04:43.375
BECAUSE THEY'RE IN SO MANY

02:04:43.442 --> 02:04:44.443
PRODUCTS.

02:04:44.510 --> 02:04:45.211
IT.

02:04:45.277 --> 02:04:46.378
YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE GOING

02:04:46.445 --> 02:04:49.048
TO STAY BE AN PEOPLE SYSTEMS AT

02:04:49.114 --> 02:04:50.883
ANY GIVEN TIME.

02:04:50.950 --> 02:04:51.684
OKAY THANK YOU.

02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:53.819
ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO

02:04:53.886 --> 02:04:56.255
DOCTOR SOLOMON [inaudible]

02:04:56.322 --> 02:04:58.424
SO.

02:04:58.490 --> 02:05:00.693
THERE WAS AT AN OUTSIDE REVIEW

02:05:00.759 --> 02:05:03.162
OF THE PROGRAM.

02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:05.364
WITH SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO

02:05:05.431 --> 02:05:07.099
ACCELERATE --

02:05:07.166 --> 02:05:14.173
THE THE PROGRAM SO COULD LOOK AT

02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:15.641
MORE CHEMICALS MORE QUICKLY.

02:05:15.708 --> 02:05:17.309
SO THAT.

02:05:17.376 --> 02:05:18.444
THE PERSON WE'RE GONNA TALK TO

02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:20.579
IS THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR AT

HONORED TO TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT

02:06:11.697 --> 02:06:14.500
AT PRESENT TESTIMONY TODAY I AM

02:06:14.566 --> 02:06:16.902
THE PRINCIPAL AUTHOR OF THE

02:06:16.969 --> 02:06:18.504
STUDY -- OUT

02:06:18.570 --> 02:06:20.706
ON CALIFORNIA'S GREEN CHEMISTRY

02:06:20.773 --> 02:06:22.775
INITIATIVE AT AGE.

02:06:22.841 --> 02:06:24.076
TEN AND THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED

02:06:24.143 --> 02:06:26.946
IS A RESEARCH COLLABORATION.

02:06:27.012 --> 02:06:29.181
TWO AND YOU SEE SAN FRANCISCO

02:06:29.248 --> 02:06:29.748
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO AREN'T

02:06:29.815 --> 02:06:32.084
FAMILIAR WITH THAT PA TRY IT'S A

02:06:32.151 --> 02:06:33.886
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT

02:06:33.953 --> 02:06:35.654
PROMOTES HEALTH AND WELL BEING

02:06:35.721 --> 02:06:37.022
AND QUALITY.

02:06:37.089 --> 02:06:39.391
OF LIFE THROUGH RESEARCH POLICY

02:06:39.458 --> 02:06:42.728
CHANGE AND DIRECT SERVICE.

02:06:42.795 --> 02:06:44.930
THIS PROJECT WAS ALSO SUPPORTED

02:06:44.997 --> 02:06:46.432
BY A GRANT FROM THE CALIFORNIA

02:06:46.498 --> 02:06:49.301
BREAST CANCER RESEARCH PROGRAM.

02:06:49.368 --> 02:06:51.737
AT C. B. C. R. P. IS THE LARGEST

02:06:51.804 --> 02:06:53.472
STATE FUNDED BREAST CANCER

02:06:53.539 --> 02:06:56.175
RESEARCH EFFORT IN THE COUNTRY.

02:06:56.241 --> 02:06:58.544
AND THAT PROGRAM IS FUNDED

02:06:58.610 --> 02:07:00.446
THROUGH A PORTION OF THE TOBACCO

02:07:00.512 --> 02:07:01.914
TAX -- AND

02:07:01.981 --> 02:07:03.816
IS ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE UC

02:07:03.882 --> 02:07:05.217
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT.

02:07:05.284 --> 02:07:06.485
IT FUNDS RESEARCH INTO THE

02:07:06.552 --> 02:07:08.654
CAUSES AND THE PREVENTION OF

02:07:08.721 --> 02:07:10.656
BREAST CANCER AND SO SOME OF THE

02:07:10.723 --> 02:07:11.991
PROJECT --

02:07:12.057 --> 02:07:13.792
LOOK AT POLICIES THAT HAVE THE

02:07:13.859 --> 02:07:15.694
POTENTIAL TO REDUCE BREAST

02:07:15.761 --> 02:07:17.096
CANCER RISK --

02:07:17.162 --> 02:07:19.398
AND SO THE NEXUS TO THIS PROJECT

02:07:19.465 --> 02:07:21.033
IS THAT HUNDREDS OF CHEMICALS

02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:22.034
HAVE BEEN LINKED TO BREAST

02:07:22.101 --> 02:07:25.404
CANCER EITHER DIRECTLY IN HUMANS

02:07:25.471 --> 02:07:27.740
OR ANIMALS WERE IN THROUGH

02:07:27.806 --> 02:07:29.475
INDIRECT EVIDENCE SUCH AS

02:07:29.541 --> 02:07:31.477
ESTROGENIC OF FACTS --

02:07:31.543 --> 02:07:33.145
ESTROGENIC ACTIVITY --

02:07:33.212 --> 02:07:34.747
AND MANY DOZENS OF THESE

02:07:34.813 --> 02:07:36.682
CHEMICALS ARE STILL IN

02:07:36.749 --> 02:07:37.983
WIDESPREAD USE IN CONSUMER

02:07:38.050 --> 02:07:39.184
PRODUCTS.

02:07:39.251 --> 02:07:41.787
IN FACT OF MY ANALYSIS FOUND A

02:07:41.854 --> 02:07:42.955
HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN OF

02:07:43.022 --> 02:07:45.324
BREAST CANCER RELEVANT CHEMICALS

02:07:45.391 --> 02:07:48.427
ARE ON THE DTS SEE CAN IT

02:07:48.494 --> 02:07:49.461
CHEMICALS LESS SAID THERE IS A

02:07:49.528 --> 02:07:53.866
FAIR AMOUNT OF OVERLAP THERE --

02:07:53.932 --> 02:07:56.568
THE RESEARCH PROJECT HOWEVER DO

02:07:56.635 --> 02:07:57.102
THE LADY.

02:07:57.169 --> 02:07:58.537
AT TO UP WITH EITHER POLICY

02:07:58.604 --> 02:07:59.838
ENHANCEMENTS THAT COULD

02:07:59.905 --> 02:08:01.607
STRENGTHEN THE CALIFORNIA GREEN

02:08:01.673 --> 02:08:03.709
CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE FOCUSING ON

02:08:03.776 --> 02:08:05.444
THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS

02:08:05.511 --> 02:08:06.178
PROGRAM THAT YOU JUST HEARD

02:08:06.245 --> 02:08:07.646
ABOUT --

02:08:07.713 --> 02:08:10.082
THAT WAS ESTABLISHED ENTRY BE --

02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:10.616
EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE ALSO

02:08:10.682 --> 02:08:12.017
LOOKED AT THE TOXICS INFORMATION

02:08:12.084 --> 02:08:13.986
CLEARING HOUSE --

02:08:14.053 --> 02:08:15.821
UNDER SB --

02:08:15.888 --> 02:08:16.488
FIVE OH NINE SO BE TALKING ABOUT

02:08:16.555 --> 02:08:18.090
THE BOTH OF THOSE IN THE BROADER

02:08:18.157 --> 02:08:19.758
FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF

02:08:19.825 --> 02:08:21.393
THE REPORT IN THIS PRESENTATION

02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:22.528
I'M HAPPY TO TALK.

02:08:22.594 --> 02:08:24.096
IN MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE BREAST

02:08:24.163 --> 02:08:26.165
CANCER SPECIFIC FINDINGS IN

02:08:26.231 --> 02:08:28.167
RESPONSE TO ANY QUESTIONS --

02:08:28.233 --> 02:08:29.635
AT THE END.

02:08:29.701 --> 02:08:31.270
OF AND JUST TO SUMMARIZE WE GET

02:08:31.336 --> 02:08:32.738
TO THE CHASE OF THE MAIN

02:08:32.805 --> 02:08:34.540
FINDING OF THE STUDY ARE THAT

02:08:34.606 --> 02:08:36.809
THE CALIFORNIA LAWS AND THE

02:08:36.875 --> 02:08:39.778
PROGRAM ARE EXTREMELY INNOVATIVE

02:08:39.845 --> 02:08:41.280
THEY HAVE A VERY BROAD.

02:08:41.346 --> 02:08:43.715
IMPACT THE GOES VERY FAR OF

02:08:43.782 --> 02:08:45.517
BECAUSE WORLDWIDE REALLY GOES

02:08:45.584 --> 02:08:47.052
FAR BEYOND CALIFORNIA.

02:08:47.119 --> 02:08:48.620
AND THE PROGRAM EFFECTIVELY

02:08:48.687 --> 02:08:49.988
ADDRESSES SOME OF THE KEY

02:08:50.055 --> 02:08:53.492
ELEMENTS OF A STRONG REGULATORY

02:08:53.559 --> 02:08:54.927
PROGRAM.

02:08:54.993 --> 02:08:56.161
I DID FIND THAT TWO OF THE GAPS

02:08:56.228 --> 02:08:57.629
THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE

02:08:57.696 --> 02:08:59.064
ORIGINAL REPORT TO THE

02:08:59.131 --> 02:09:00.399
LEGISLATURE THAT ACTUALLY.

02:09:00.466 --> 02:09:03.735
SPURRED THE CREATION OF THESE

02:09:03.802 --> 02:09:04.703
OUT.

02:09:04.770 --> 02:09:07.873
OF THE PROGRAM THE DATA GAP AND

02:09:07.940 --> 02:09:09.808
THE TECHNOLOGY GAP.

02:09:09.875 --> 02:09:11.009
THIS TO THIS DAY THEY'VE BEEN

02:09:11.076 --> 02:09:12.711
LARGELY UNADDRESSED

02:09:12.778 --> 02:09:14.079
UNFORTUNATELY.

02:09:14.146 --> 02:09:16.181
IN ADDITION THE SLOW PACE OF THE

02:09:16.248 --> 02:09:17.516
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM

02:09:17.583 --> 02:09:19.785
RELATIVE TO THE HUGE SCOPE OF

02:09:19.852 --> 02:09:22.688
THE TASK --

02:09:22.754 --> 02:09:25.290
AS WAS JUST DISCUSS.

02:09:25.357 --> 02:09:26.592
IS.

02:09:26.658 --> 02:09:28.060
IT HAS REALLY --

02:09:28.127 --> 02:09:29.928
IMPAIRED ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN

02:09:29.995 --> 02:09:31.597
ADDRESSING THE BIG BACKLOG OF

02:09:31.663 --> 02:09:34.099
CHEMICALS AND PRODUCTS THAT

02:09:34.166 --> 02:09:35.868
MIGHT REQUIRE EVALUATION --

02:09:35.934 --> 02:09:37.436
SO JUST TO SUMMARIZE BRIEFLY THE

02:09:37.503 --> 02:09:39.104
METHODOLOGY OF THE PROJECT

02:09:39.171 --> 02:09:40.506
PROJECT IS A QUALITATIVE

02:09:40.572 --> 02:09:42.241
RESEARCH PROJECT INCLUDED

02:09:42.307 --> 02:09:43.742
SCOPING REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE

02:09:43.809 --> 02:09:45.544
TO LOOK AT BEST PRACTICES.

02:09:45.611 --> 02:09:48.547
IN CHEMICAL POLICY THAT HELPED

02:09:48.614 --> 02:09:50.716
SERIES OF INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

02:09:50.782 --> 02:09:52.384
THAN WE DID SEMI STRUCTURED

02:09:52.451 --> 02:09:54.253
INTERVIEWS WITH EXPERTS IN GREEN

02:09:54.319 --> 02:09:55.687
CHEMISTRY IN THE SCIENCE AND THE

02:09:55.754 --> 02:09:57.022
POLICY ASPECTS OF GREEN

02:09:57.089 --> 02:09:58.891
CHEMISTRY.

02:09:58.957 --> 02:09:59.958
THOSE INTERVIEWS WERE TAPED

02:10:00.025 --> 02:10:02.861
PROFESSIONALLY TRANSCRIBED EVERY

02:10:02.928 --> 02:10:05.397
TRANSCRIPTION WAS CHECKED OUT BY

02:10:05.464 --> 02:10:06.198
ME.

02:10:06.265 --> 02:10:08.600
AND AND THEN THEY WERE COLLUDED

02:10:08.667 --> 02:10:11.069
TO EXTRACT THEMES THAT.

02:10:11.136 --> 02:10:13.472
EMERGED ACROSS THE DIFFERENT

02:10:13.539 --> 02:10:14.640
INTERVIEWS.

02:10:14.706 --> 02:10:15.841
SO -- I

02:10:15.908 --> 02:10:17.576
INTERVIEWED TWO DOZEN EXPERTS

02:10:17.643 --> 02:10:19.378
FROM GOVERNMENT ACADEMIA THE

02:10:19.444 --> 02:10:20.913
BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND THE

02:10:20.979 --> 02:10:22.748
NONPROFIT SECTOR --

02:10:22.814 --> 02:10:24.249
THEY WERE SELECTED BASED ON BOTH

02:10:24.316 --> 02:10:26.185
THEIR EXPERTISE AND ALSO AT THE

02:10:26.251 --> 02:10:29.054
DIVERSITY OF OPINIONS THAT THEY

02:10:29.121 --> 02:10:29.922
HAVE.

02:10:29.988 --> 02:10:32.558
OTHER DIVERSITY OF VIEWPOINTS --

02:10:32.624 --> 02:10:33.859
AND THAT WAS THE INITIAL ROUND

02:10:33.926 --> 02:10:36.094
OF INTERVIEWS MORE THAN HALF OF

02:10:36.161 --> 02:10:37.596
THOSE FOLKS WERE IN CALIFORNIA

02:10:37.663 --> 02:10:39.131
BUT I LOOKED AT PEOPLE FROM

02:10:39.198 --> 02:10:40.866
OTHER STATE INTERVIEWED PEOPLE

02:10:40.933 --> 02:10:42.367
FROM OTHER STATES NATIONALLY AND

02:10:42.434 --> 02:10:45.137
INTERNATIONALLY --

02:10:45.204 --> 02:10:46.772
AND THE INTERVIEWS --

02:10:46.838 --> 02:10:48.373
ULTIMATELY IDENTIFIED GENERATED

02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:49.675
ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED TEXT

02:10:49.741 --> 02:10:54.046
EXCERPTS FOR ANALYSIS.

02:10:54.112 --> 02:10:54.646
THEN THE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS

02:10:54.713 --> 02:10:55.214
FROM THAT FIRST ROUND WERE

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:57.683
PRESENTED ONE ON ONE IN THE

02:10:57.749 --> 02:10:59.718
SECOND ROUND OF INTERVIEWS THAT

02:10:59.785 --> 02:11:01.186
WERE LESS STRUCTURED.

02:11:01.253 --> 02:11:03.021
WITH TEN ADDITIONAL EXPERTS FROM

02:11:03.088 --> 02:11:05.224
ALL DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND

02:11:05.290 --> 02:11:07.092
FINDINGS WERE FIND BASED ON THE

02:11:07.159 --> 02:11:09.695
FEEDBACK AND THE ENTIRE PROJECT

02:11:09.761 --> 02:11:12.531
WAS OVERSEEN BY AN EIGHT MEMBER

02:11:12.598 --> 02:11:15.434
SCIENCE POLICY ADVISORY GROUP.

02:11:15.500 --> 02:11:17.302
SO THE FINDINGS REALLY WERE THAT

02:11:17.369 --> 02:11:19.204
THE CALIFORNIA GREEN CHEMISTRY

02:11:19.271 --> 02:11:20.739
LAWS IN GENERAL --

02:11:20.806 --> 02:11:23.909
AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE IS.

02:11:23.976 --> 02:11:25.477
AND THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS

02:11:25.544 --> 02:11:27.479
PROGRAM --

02:11:27.546 --> 02:11:30.816
WERE CITED BY. THREE QUARTERS OF

02:11:30.882 --> 02:11:32.684
EXPERTS FROM ALL PERSPECTIVES AS

02:11:32.751 --> 02:11:35.587
UNIQUE INNOVATIVE.

02:11:35.654 --> 02:11:37.756
HAVING A VERY BROAD SCOPE AND AN

02:11:37.823 --> 02:11:40.892
INTERNATIONAL IMPACT SO I THINK

02:11:40.959 --> 02:11:42.160
WE CAN BE --

02:11:42.227 --> 02:11:43.528
IMPRESSED AND PROUD OF THAT

02:11:43.595 --> 02:11:46.298
FINDING. ONE BUSINESS SCIENTISTS

02:11:46.365 --> 02:11:47.633
FROM OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA IS BEING

02:11:47.699 --> 02:11:48.934
A PUT IT WELL I THINK BY SAYING

02:11:49.001 --> 02:11:51.570
I THINK THE CALIFORNIA IS TRYING

02:11:51.637 --> 02:11:52.404
TO DO THINGS THAT NOBODY'S DONE

02:11:52.471 --> 02:11:54.106
BEFORE --

02:11:54.172 --> 02:11:56.241
WHICH IS WHAT I THOUGHT WAS UP A

02:11:56.308 --> 02:11:58.377
PLUS IT'S CERTAINLY BY THE

02:11:58.443 --> 02:11:59.511
CONTEXT --

02:11:59.578 --> 02:12:01.313
SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM

02:12:01.380 --> 02:12:02.881
WAS ALSO RECOGNIZED BY MOST

02:12:02.948 --> 02:12:05.417
EXPERTS AS HAVING FOUR MAIN

02:12:05.484 --> 02:12:07.486
OTHER STRENGTHS HEADS VERY BROAD

02:12:07.552 --> 02:12:09.821
SCOPE IN AUTHORITY ACROSS ENTIRE

02:12:09.888 --> 02:12:11.556
CLASSES OF CHEMICALS AS YOU'VE

02:12:11.623 --> 02:12:12.758
HEARD AND ACROSS.

02:12:12.824 --> 02:12:14.760
A HUGE SWATH OF CONSUMER

02:12:14.826 --> 02:12:16.228
PRODUCTS --

02:12:16.295 --> 02:12:18.263
SECONDLY IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO

02:12:18.330 --> 02:12:20.198
PROMOTE INNOVATION AND REDUCE

02:12:20.265 --> 02:12:21.466
THIS RISK OF REGRETTABLE

02:12:21.533 --> 02:12:23.302
SUBSTITUTION THAT WE'VE HEARD

02:12:23.368 --> 02:12:24.503
ABOUT TODAY.

02:12:24.569 --> 02:12:27.372
THIRDLY AT THERE'S A FOCUS AT

02:12:27.439 --> 02:12:28.373
KAT COMMENDABLE FOCUS ON

02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:29.608
PROTECTING VULNERABLE

02:12:29.675 --> 02:12:30.976
POPULATIONS AND SUB GROUPS SUCH

02:12:31.043 --> 02:12:32.544
AS CHILDREN.

02:12:32.611 --> 02:12:33.445
AND FINALLY --

02:12:33.512 --> 02:12:39.217
THERE ARE MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES

02:12:39.284 --> 02:12:40.552
SAYS SO THOSE FOUR THINGS WERE

02:12:40.619 --> 02:12:41.853
ARE REALLY VERY --

02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:43.755
CAME UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS

02:12:43.822 --> 02:12:46.158
VERY SOLID --

02:12:46.224 --> 02:12:47.726
SO DOCTOR OVER HELL MENTIONED

02:12:47.793 --> 02:12:49.194
THE THREE GAPS THAT WERE

02:12:49.261 --> 02:12:52.064
IDENTIFIED IN THE ORIGINAL TWO

02:12:52.130 --> 02:12:52.631
THOUSAND SIX REPORT TO THE

02:12:52.698 --> 02:12:54.132
LEGISLATURE UP FROM THE

02:12:54.199 --> 02:12:56.401
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BY A

02:12:56.468 --> 02:12:57.736
DOCTOR'S MIKE WILSON WHO I

02:12:57.803 --> 02:12:58.937
BELIEVE IS IN THE AUDIENCE HERE

02:12:59.004 --> 02:13:01.540
TODAY -- AND

02:13:01.606 --> 02:13:03.208
DOCTOR MAKE SCHWARTZMAN QUITE

02:13:03.275 --> 02:13:05.510
BELIEVE IS WATCHING THAT WEBCAST

02:13:05.577 --> 02:13:07.612
UP FROM UC BERKELEY --

02:13:07.679 --> 02:13:10.182
AND OUR FINDINGS IN THIS PROJECT

02:13:10.248 --> 02:13:12.551
SUPPORTED THE ANALYSIS OF THESE

02:13:12.617 --> 02:13:14.920
THREE GAPS BUT ALSO IDENTIFIED

02:13:14.986 --> 02:13:16.488
THAT THERE SUB COMPONENTS OF

02:13:16.555 --> 02:13:17.923
EACH OF THESE THREE GAPS.

02:13:17.989 --> 02:13:19.224
AND SO I THINK IT TOO USEFUL

02:13:19.291 --> 02:13:20.926
FRAMING FOR SOME OF THE FINDINGS

02:13:20.992 --> 02:13:23.028
IN THE REPORT SO AS A REMINDER

02:13:23.095 --> 02:13:26.465
THE THREE GAPS ARE THE DATA GAP --

02:13:26.531 --> 02:13:28.433
THAT SAFETY GAP AND THE

02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:31.603
TECHNOLOGY GAP.

02:13:31.670 --> 02:13:33.238
AND THE DATA GAP.

02:13:33.305 --> 02:13:36.174
COME TO GO BACK TO THAT --

02:13:36.241 --> 02:13:37.376
WELL JUST TO SUMMARIZE THE MAIN

02:13:37.442 --> 02:13:38.643
WEAKNESSES IN THE CALIFORNIA

02:13:38.710 --> 02:13:40.011
PROGRAM OR THAT THE DATA GAP IN

02:13:40.078 --> 02:13:41.646
THE TECHNOLOGY GAP.

02:13:41.713 --> 02:13:43.014
ARE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS THEY

02:13:43.081 --> 02:13:44.916
STILL HAVE NOT REALLY BEEN

02:13:44.983 --> 02:13:46.418
ADDRESSED BY THE LEGISLATION

02:13:46.485 --> 02:13:48.487
THAT'S IN PLACE MISS SAFETY GAP

02:13:48.553 --> 02:13:52.290
IS PARTLY ADDRESSED --

02:13:52.357 --> 02:13:54.326
SO LOOKING AT THE DATA GAP THERE

02:13:54.393 --> 02:13:55.961
ACTUALLY THREE COMPONENTS OF THE

02:13:56.027 --> 02:13:59.097
DATA GAP. ONE IS GAPS IN

02:13:59.164 --> 02:14:01.400
CHEMICAL TOXICITY DATA AND OTHER

02:14:01.466 --> 02:14:02.134
WORDS.

02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:04.002
IT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF

02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:05.437
THE P. FASTS CHEMICALS BEING

02:14:05.504 --> 02:14:07.272
WELL STUDIED SOME OF THEM NOT

02:14:07.339 --> 02:14:10.308
BEING WELL STUDIED THEIR DATA

02:14:10.375 --> 02:14:12.411
GAPS IN THE TOXICITY.

02:14:12.477 --> 02:14:13.912
THAT HIM TESTING THAT HAVE BEEN

02:14:13.979 --> 02:14:15.046
DONE --

02:14:15.113 --> 02:14:17.883
THAT'S GONNA HAVE TWO PROBLEMS

02:14:17.949 --> 02:14:18.517
ONE IS IT CAN MAKE THE

02:14:18.583 --> 02:14:19.651
ALTERNATES ANALYSES A LOT HARDER

02:14:19.718 --> 02:14:22.187
TO DO BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE --

02:14:22.254 --> 02:14:25.557
EXPECTING TURN ITS ANALYSES

02:14:25.624 --> 02:14:26.858
LOOKING AT DIFFERENT CHEMICALS

02:14:26.925 --> 02:14:28.326
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN

02:14:28.393 --> 02:14:31.062
FULLY TESTED OR SCREEN --

02:14:31.129 --> 02:14:32.164
FOR DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON HUMAN

02:14:32.230 --> 02:14:34.232
HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT --

02:14:34.299 --> 02:14:36.268
THEN IN ADDITION IT COULD --

02:14:36.334 --> 02:14:38.370
KEEP THE KENNETT CHEMICALS LIST

02:14:38.437 --> 02:14:39.704
FROM BEING AS FULLY UP TO DATE

02:14:39.771 --> 02:14:40.539
AS IT SHOULD BE.

02:14:40.605 --> 02:14:43.175
A LOT OF CHEMICALS ON THAT LIST

02:14:43.241 --> 02:14:45.243
BUT THEY'RE STILL NORMA'S NUMBER

02:14:45.310 --> 02:14:46.244
OUT THERE THAT REALLY HAVEN'T

02:14:46.311 --> 02:14:47.179
BEEN --

02:14:47.245 --> 02:14:49.047
SCREENED AND WE DON'T KNOW IF

02:14:49.114 --> 02:14:50.015
THEY SHOULD BE ON THE LIST OR

02:14:50.081 --> 02:14:52.117
NOT SAID THAT IS --

02:14:52.184 --> 02:14:53.385
UP PROBLEM.

02:14:53.452 --> 02:14:54.753
THIS GAP THOUGH COULD BE

02:14:54.820 --> 02:14:56.254
ADDRESSED BECAUSE THEY'RE NEW

02:14:56.321 --> 02:14:59.691
PREDICTIVE TOXICOLOGY METHODS

02:14:59.758 --> 02:15:01.426
THAT ARE.

02:15:01.493 --> 02:15:02.794
ACTUALLY DEVELOPING INCREDIBLY

02:15:02.861 --> 02:15:05.997
RAPIDLY THAT ALLOWS --

02:15:06.064 --> 02:15:08.567
ALLOWS VERY I THINK AFFECTED

02:15:08.633 --> 02:15:11.203
PREDICTION OF TOXICITY OF

02:15:11.269 --> 02:15:12.337
CHEMICALS.

02:15:12.404 --> 02:15:13.872
AND A WE HA THE OFFICE OF

02:15:13.939 --> 02:15:15.106
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD

02:15:15.173 --> 02:15:16.775
ASSESSMENT IS DEVELOPING THE

02:15:16.842 --> 02:15:19.578
ABILITY TO TO USE THESE METHODS.

02:15:19.644 --> 02:15:21.880
AND COULD USE THEM TO ANTICIPATE

02:15:21.947 --> 02:15:23.682
THE HAZARDS OF EMERGING

02:15:23.748 --> 02:15:24.783
CHEMICALS SO THIS IS A A

02:15:24.850 --> 02:15:27.385
POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY I THINK --

02:15:27.452 --> 02:15:29.087
THEN THE SECOND DAY THE GAP IS

02:15:29.154 --> 02:15:32.023
THE GAP OF IT IN EXPOSURE DATA.

02:15:32.090 --> 02:15:35.861
ON IT TOO VERY HARD TO KNOW

02:15:35.927 --> 02:15:39.097
WHAT'S GETTING IN ENVIRONMENT

02:15:39.164 --> 02:15:41.299
FACT AGAIN TO USE THE P. FAST

02:15:41.366 --> 02:15:43.168
EXAMPLE THOSE CHEMICALS BECAME

02:15:43.235 --> 02:15:47.472
EXTREMELY WIDESPREAD IN WATER --

02:15:47.539 --> 02:15:49.608
AND AND SOIL CONTAMINATION IN

02:15:49.674 --> 02:15:50.275
EVEN -- YOU

02:15:50.342 --> 02:15:52.277
KNOW THERE'S AIRBORNE THEIR P.

02:15:52.344 --> 02:15:54.980
FAST ETHER IS THERE'S AIRBORNE.

02:15:55.046 --> 02:15:57.816
HAZARDS AS WELL --

02:15:57.883 --> 02:15:59.384
SO THE IDEA THAT THERE WASN'T A

02:15:59.451 --> 02:16:00.919
REAL THERE ISN'T A REALIZATION

02:16:00.986 --> 02:16:01.887
OFTEN THAT THESE CHEMICALS ARE

02:16:01.953 --> 02:16:03.421
GETTING OUT THERE INTO THE

02:16:03.488 --> 02:16:05.390
ENVIRONMENT AND TELL --

02:16:05.457 --> 02:16:07.192
KIND OF LATE IN THE PROCESS.

02:16:07.259 --> 02:16:08.426
THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED BY

02:16:08.493 --> 02:16:10.695
EXPANDING THE BIO MONITORING

02:16:10.762 --> 02:16:13.999
CALIFORNIA PROGRAM TO BETTER.

02:16:14.065 --> 02:16:16.268
AT TRACK CHEMICALS IN PEOPLE.

02:16:16.334 --> 02:16:18.703
AND ALSO BY ENHANCING AND BETTER

02:16:18.770 --> 02:16:20.705
INTEGRATING ENVIRONMENTAL

02:16:20.772 --> 02:16:22.140
MONITORING THAT'S GOING ON ON

02:16:22.207 --> 02:16:24.509
CHEMICALS IN THE AIR WATER FOOD

02:16:24.576 --> 02:16:26.578
AND PRODUCTS --

02:16:26.645 --> 02:16:28.113
AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S THE

02:16:28.179 --> 02:16:30.081
GAPS THAT THE PART OF THE DATA

02:16:30.148 --> 02:16:31.283
GAP THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SO

02:16:31.349 --> 02:16:33.618
FAR TODAY WHICH IS THE GAP ON

02:16:33.685 --> 02:16:35.253
INGREDIENTS INFORMATION AND

02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:36.521
PRODUCTS.

02:16:36.588 --> 02:16:38.423
AND THAT IS JUST A THRESHOLD

02:16:38.490 --> 02:16:40.325
PROBLEM FOR DTS SEE.

02:16:40.392 --> 02:16:40.892
THAT WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO

02:16:40.959 --> 02:16:42.260
PRIORITIZE CHEMICALS AND

02:16:42.327 --> 02:16:43.728
PRODUCTS FOR REGULATION AND TO

02:16:43.795 --> 02:16:45.830
THE PROGRAM IT'S IT'S VERY HARD

02:16:45.897 --> 02:16:51.136
AND IT'S EM ONE OF THE QUOTES

02:16:51.202 --> 02:16:54.439
THAT GOT ACTION TING EXPEDITION.

02:16:54.506 --> 02:16:56.007
YOU CAN SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND

02:16:56.074 --> 02:16:58.209
MONEY LOOKING AT THINGS THAT

02:16:58.276 --> 02:17:00.312
AREN'T HIGH IMPACT.

02:17:00.378 --> 02:17:03.214
AND I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY UP

02:17:03.281 --> 02:17:05.183
THAT CAPTURES THE PROBLEM.

02:17:05.250 --> 02:17:08.119
AND AT ANOTHER SCIENTIST WHO I

02:17:08.186 --> 02:17:08.920
INTERVIEWED --

02:17:08.987 --> 02:17:10.021
SAID THAT CHEMICAL USE

02:17:10.088 --> 02:17:11.389
INFORMATION IT'S REALLY

02:17:11.456 --> 02:17:13.091
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE SIMPLY

02:17:13.158 --> 02:17:14.426
GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE THE

02:17:14.492 --> 02:17:15.894
DEPARTMENT THE AUTHORITY TO

02:17:15.961 --> 02:17:17.228
REQUIRE.

02:17:17.295 --> 02:17:18.763
AND THAT THE THIRTY OUGHT TO BE

02:17:18.830 --> 02:17:21.933
AVAILABLE FOR PRODUCTS.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:23.802
OUT WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN

02:17:23.868 --> 02:17:25.503
THIS CUP FOR EXAMPLE.

02:17:25.570 --> 02:17:27.238
AND FOR CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS

02:17:27.305 --> 02:17:28.974
IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE ARE YOU

02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:34.179
SELLING YOUR CHEMICAL LACKS.

02:17:34.245 --> 02:17:34.779
SO THAT THEY CAN COME OUT OF

02:17:34.846 --> 02:17:36.748
FROM BOTH PERSPECTIVES AND THEN

02:17:36.815 --> 02:17:38.817
THAT SPEAKS TO THIS ISSUE IN THE%

02:17:38.883 --> 02:17:40.251
BAY AREA --

02:17:40.318 --> 02:17:41.486
IAN WE'RE WE'RE DETAILS HE SAID

02:17:41.553 --> 02:17:42.587
SOMETIMES THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW

02:17:42.654 --> 02:17:43.588
WHO TO ASK --

02:17:43.655 --> 02:17:47.292
AND IF THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT --

02:17:47.359 --> 02:17:48.259
THE PEOPLE NOT EVEN KNOWING

02:17:48.326 --> 02:17:49.494
WHAT'S COMING THROUGH THEIR

02:17:49.561 --> 02:17:53.164
SUPPLY CHAINS --

02:17:53.231 --> 02:17:54.699
SAID THEY DID A GAP THOUGH IT

02:17:54.766 --> 02:17:55.600
AIN'T IN INGREDIENTS INFORMATION

02:17:55.667 --> 02:17:56.701
RELATES DIRECTLY THE OTHER

02:17:56.768 --> 02:17:57.335
BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF THE SAFER

02:17:57.402 --> 02:17:59.304
CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM WHICH

02:17:59.371 --> 02:18:00.772
IS THE SLOW PACE OF THE PROGRAM.

02:18:00.839 --> 02:18:03.241
BECAUSE I THINK THAT --

02:18:03.308 --> 02:18:04.542
THE DIFFICULTY [inaudible]

02:18:04.609 --> 02:18:07.879
FINDING INFORMATION HAS REALLY

02:18:07.946 --> 02:18:09.881
SLOW THE PROGRAM DOWN --

02:18:09.948 --> 02:18:11.082
ALMOST EVERYONE WHO I

02:18:11.149 --> 02:18:12.317
INTERVIEWED.

02:18:12.384 --> 02:18:13.718
SAID THAT THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN

02:18:13.785 --> 02:18:15.987
VERY SLOW.

02:18:16.054 --> 02:18:17.188
AND SOME SOME SAID THAT'S TO BE

02:18:17.255 --> 02:18:18.490
EXPECTED --

02:18:18.556 --> 02:18:20.291
GIVEN THAT IT'S BEEN GETTING UP

02:18:20.358 --> 02:18:21.660
AND RUNNING --

02:18:21.726 --> 02:18:24.029
AND OTHERS SAID THAT IT'S

02:18:24.095 --> 02:18:25.930
UNACCEPTABLE OF SOME OF FROM AN

02:18:25.997 --> 02:18:26.931
NGO SAID IT'S MOVING AT A PACE

02:18:26.998 --> 02:18:31.236
THAT SINCE THE PROGRAM.

02:18:31.302 --> 02:18:32.537
AND AND I THINK THAT --

02:18:32.604 --> 02:18:35.073
I'VE HEARD SOME OF THAT TODAY --

02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:36.708
SOMEONE FROM FROM GOVERNMENT

02:18:36.775 --> 02:18:38.476
SAID THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS

02:18:38.543 --> 02:18:40.211
PROGRAM IS LIKE A MACHINE AND

02:18:40.278 --> 02:18:41.746
THEY BUILT THE MACHINE THAT

02:18:41.813 --> 02:18:43.014
TESTING THE MACHINE THE WIDGETS

02:18:43.081 --> 02:18:44.015
MACHINE.

02:18:44.082 --> 02:18:45.517
ALL OF THAT TAKES TIME.

02:18:45.583 --> 02:18:47.018
AND BEFORE YOU START ALTERING

02:18:47.085 --> 02:18:48.520
THE MACHINE YOU HAVE TO MAKE

02:18:48.586 --> 02:18:50.188
SURE THAT ALL THE PIECES WORK.

02:18:50.255 --> 02:18:51.890
AND THEN YOU CAN GO BACK AND

02:18:51.956 --> 02:18:53.425
INCREASE THE SPEED.

02:18:53.491 --> 02:18:55.093
AND SO UP I THINK ONE OF THE

02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:56.361
FINDINGS OF THE REPORT IS AT

02:18:56.428 --> 02:18:58.296
THIS POINT THE MACHINE IS BUILT

02:18:58.363 --> 02:18:59.130
AND TESTED.

02:18:59.197 --> 02:19:02.033
SO NOW IT'S TIME TO GO BACK AND

02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:03.568
INCREASE THE SPEED.

02:19:03.635 --> 02:19:06.438
HOW DO WE DO THAT WE'LL?

02:19:06.504 --> 02:19:07.272
SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE

02:19:07.338 --> 02:19:09.007
BEEN MADE AROUND THAT ONE KEY

02:19:09.074 --> 02:19:11.076
RECOMMENDATION OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE

02:19:11.142 --> 02:19:12.944
HEARD THIS IS TO INCREASE THE

02:19:13.011 --> 02:19:14.512
FUNDING AND THE STAFF.

02:19:14.579 --> 02:19:16.047
CURRENT PROGRAM IS SEVERELY

02:19:16.114 --> 02:19:17.782
UNDER RESOURCE DID DOESN'T HAVE

02:19:17.849 --> 02:19:21.152
ITS OWN DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE --

02:19:21.219 --> 02:19:22.487
STAFF IS TOO SMALL FOR THE

02:19:22.554 --> 02:19:23.722
MANDATE --

02:19:23.788 --> 02:19:25.924
AND THE PROBLEMS DO YOU NEED TO

02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:30.261
BE ADDRESSED AND IN FACT --

02:19:30.328 --> 02:19:34.833
I FOUND THAT CAN NEEDS --

02:19:34.899 --> 02:19:36.468
TO TO REALLY RECOGNIZE ITS STATE

02:19:36.534 --> 02:19:38.470
SCIENTISTS AND PAY THEM WHAT

02:19:38.536 --> 02:19:39.971
THEY'RE WORTH --

02:19:40.038 --> 02:19:43.308
IT'S BEEN IT'S DIFFICULT --

02:19:43.375 --> 02:19:44.242
IF BOND UNDER --

02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:46.544
IN THE STATE. TO REALLY RECRUIT

02:19:46.611 --> 02:19:48.446
THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST

02:19:48.513 --> 02:19:49.447
SCIENTISTS.

02:19:49.514 --> 02:19:51.282
INTO THESE JOBS BECAUSE PEOPLE

02:19:51.349 --> 02:19:52.283
ARE HAVING TO TAKE SUCH A

02:19:52.350 --> 02:19:54.319
MASSIVE SALARY CUT IN ORDER TO

02:19:54.385 --> 02:19:55.620
DO IT AND SO.

02:19:55.687 --> 02:19:56.721
THERE ARE A LOT OF COMMITTED

02:19:56.788 --> 02:19:58.389
PEOPLE WHO DO YOU DO THAT THAT

02:19:58.456 --> 02:20:02.160
NIGHT AND I COMMEND THEM --

02:20:02.227 --> 02:20:04.963
IT'S IT'S GREAT THAT THEY DO --

02:20:05.029 --> 02:20:05.930
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER WAY TO

02:20:05.997 --> 02:20:08.867
INCREASE SPEED AND THAT IS THAT.

02:20:08.933 --> 02:20:09.968
THERE IS REALLY ONLY ONE PATHWAY

02:20:10.034 --> 02:20:13.171
THROUGH THE PROCESS AT RIGHT NOW --

02:20:13.238 --> 02:20:15.940
AT AND IT REQUIRES THIS YEAR

02:20:16.007 --> 02:20:17.642
REGULATION WHOLE REGULATORY

02:20:17.709 --> 02:20:21.346
PROCESS TO JUST IDENTIFY A

02:20:21.412 --> 02:20:22.614
PRODUCT CHEMICAL COMBINATION.

02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:24.449
THERE COULD BE OTHER FAST TRACKS

02:20:24.516 --> 02:20:27.986
THAT WOULD HELP MOVE CHEMICALS

02:20:28.052 --> 02:20:29.354
CHEMICAL PRODUCT COMBINATIONS TO

02:20:29.420 --> 02:20:31.256
ROOM MORE QUICKLY IN CERTAIN

02:20:31.322 --> 02:20:33.491
CIRCUMSTANCES --

02:20:33.558 --> 02:20:35.160
SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW IF THE

02:20:35.226 --> 02:20:37.295
PATH FORWARD IS REALLY OBVIOUS

02:20:37.362 --> 02:20:38.730
OR IF THE CHEMICAL IS NOT

02:20:38.797 --> 02:20:40.732
NECESSARY FOR THE FUNCTION OF

02:20:40.799 --> 02:20:42.500
THE PRODUCT.

02:20:42.567 --> 02:20:44.302
THEN YOU'D IS THERE REALLY A

02:20:44.369 --> 02:20:47.405
NEED FOR A FULL.

02:20:47.472 --> 02:20:49.207
PROCESS LEADING INTO A FULL

02:20:49.274 --> 02:20:51.609
ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS THAT THEN

02:20:51.676 --> 02:20:54.679
GOES ON TO TO AT A AT A

02:20:54.746 --> 02:20:57.515
REGULATORY DECISION SOMEONE FROM

02:20:57.582 --> 02:20:59.317
THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY SUGGESTED

02:20:59.384 --> 02:21:01.986
SOMETHING JUST LIKE THAT AB THAT

02:21:02.053 --> 02:21:02.453
SAID.

02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:03.988
IF YOU CAN FIND INGREDIENTS THE

02:21:04.055 --> 02:21:06.191
DON'T CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUNCTION

02:21:06.257 --> 02:21:07.258
OF THE PRODUCT.

02:21:07.325 --> 02:21:08.426
AND THEY'RE CAUSING AT LEAST A

02:21:08.493 --> 02:21:09.794
PERCEIVED PROBLEM OR AN

02:21:09.861 --> 02:21:11.329
ESTABLISHED PROBLEM.

02:21:11.396 --> 02:21:13.698
IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THOSE

02:21:13.765 --> 02:21:15.600
PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE.

02:21:15.667 --> 02:21:17.869
SORT OF A COMMON SENSE APPROACH --

02:21:17.936 --> 02:21:19.704
THIS AT THE FLAME RETURN TO NAP

02:21:19.771 --> 02:21:21.272
MATS CAME UP --

02:21:21.339 --> 02:21:23.074
JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO THAT'S A

02:21:23.141 --> 02:21:24.576
REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING

02:21:24.642 --> 02:21:26.344
WHERE IT DIDN'T NEED TO BE IN

02:21:26.411 --> 02:21:28.112
THE PRODUCT FOR THE FUNCTION OF

02:21:28.179 --> 02:21:29.814
THE PRODUCT TO IN FACT WHEN.

02:21:29.881 --> 02:21:31.182
THE DEPARTMENT STARTED THE

02:21:31.249 --> 02:21:33.351
REGULATORY PROCESS MANUFACTURES

02:21:33.418 --> 02:21:35.353
VOLUNTARILY WENT AHEAD AND

02:21:35.420 --> 02:21:37.789
REMOVE THE FLAME RETARDANTS FROM

02:21:37.856 --> 02:21:38.356
THEM NOT MATCH THAT'S GREAT

02:21:38.423 --> 02:21:38.656
[inaudible]

02:21:38.723 --> 02:21:41.459
HOWEVER.

02:21:41.526 --> 02:21:44.028
THAT MEANT THAT IF THE

02:21:44.095 --> 02:21:46.497
LEGISLATURE HAD NOT VAN ACTED TO

02:21:46.564 --> 02:21:47.832
BAN FLAME RETARDANTS FROM NAP

02:21:47.899 --> 02:21:49.234
MATS.

02:21:49.300 --> 02:21:51.736
THE DEPARTMENT WOULDN'T HAVE

02:21:51.803 --> 02:21:52.737
BEEN ABLE TO BAN THEM EITHER.

02:21:52.804 --> 02:21:54.973
BECAUSE BY THE TIME THEY WERE

02:21:55.039 --> 02:21:57.542
DEAD DTS SEE WAS READY.

02:21:57.609 --> 02:22:00.712
TO RECEIVE ALTERNATES ANALYSES.

02:22:00.778 --> 02:22:03.681
THERE WEREN'T ANY TO RECEIVE.

02:22:03.748 --> 02:22:05.950
AND SO THE PROCESS AND IT --

02:22:06.017 --> 02:22:08.386
DETAILS HE WENT OUT VERIFIED

02:22:08.453 --> 02:22:08.887
THAT THERE AREN'T FLAME

02:22:08.953 --> 02:22:10.455
RETARDANTS IN THAT MATCH AT THIS

02:22:10.521 --> 02:22:12.290
POINT IN TIME THAT'S GREAT.

02:22:12.357 --> 02:22:14.325
IF.

02:22:14.392 --> 02:22:15.693
COUPLE YEARS FROM NOW.

02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:17.428
IF THERE HADN'T BEEN LEGISLATION

02:22:17.495 --> 02:22:19.030
COUPLE YEARS FROM NOW SEVERAL

02:22:19.097 --> 02:22:22.166
COMPANIES COULD HAVE STARTED PUT

02:22:22.233 --> 02:22:23.201
FLAME RETURNS BACK IN THAT

02:22:23.268 --> 02:22:24.969
MATT'S --

02:22:25.036 --> 02:22:25.837
BECAUSE DTS HE'S UNABLE TO

02:22:25.904 --> 02:22:27.805
ACTUALLY FINISH THE PROCESS AND

02:22:27.872 --> 02:22:29.307
BàN.

02:22:29.374 --> 02:22:29.908
A FLAME RETARDANT IN AND NOT

02:22:29.974 --> 02:22:35.013
MATT IF THEY DON'T GET --

02:22:35.079 --> 02:22:37.415
A PROBLEM AS WELL THAT AN WHERE

02:22:37.482 --> 02:22:38.850
THEY COULD SORT OF CUT TO THE

02:22:38.917 --> 02:22:40.652
CHASE AND JUST TAKE A REGULATORY

02:22:40.718 --> 02:22:43.421
ACTION -- SO

02:22:43.488 --> 02:22:44.689
THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF

02:22:44.756 --> 02:22:46.958
SUGGESTIONS --

02:22:47.025 --> 02:22:49.994
AND AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUES

02:22:50.061 --> 02:22:52.163
THAT CAME UP THAT I THINK --

02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:52.897
YEAH I FOUNDER MORE

02:22:52.964 --> 02:22:55.099
CONTROVERSIAL AMONG --

02:22:55.166 --> 02:22:55.600
MEMBERS OF THE BUSINESS

02:22:55.667 --> 02:22:57.769
COMMUNITY BUT RELATE TO SOME OF

02:22:57.835 --> 02:22:59.804
THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT

02:22:59.871 --> 02:23:01.372
WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE --

02:23:01.439 --> 02:23:02.473
SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE ACTING

02:23:02.540 --> 02:23:06.210
ON PRODUCTS IS THAT --

02:23:06.277 --> 02:23:07.745
LEGISLATURE COULD --

02:23:07.812 --> 02:23:10.448
IF THEY WANTED IF YOU KNOW

02:23:10.515 --> 02:23:12.650
LEGISLATURE ONE TO TAKE ACTION

02:23:12.717 --> 02:23:14.185
ON A CHEMICAL IN PRODUCT.

02:23:14.252 --> 02:23:16.254
BUT WAS WORRIED ABOUT THIS ISSUE

02:23:16.321 --> 02:23:17.588
REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION SAID

02:23:17.655 --> 02:23:20.325
WANTED SOME SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS.

02:23:20.391 --> 02:23:21.592
COULD.

02:23:21.659 --> 02:23:23.361
SKIP THE INITIAL --

02:23:23.428 --> 02:23:24.762
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT

02:23:24.829 --> 02:23:26.864
PROCESS FOR THAT PRODUCT

02:23:26.931 --> 02:23:28.466
IDENTIFICATION.

02:23:28.533 --> 02:23:29.934
AND JUST PUT THE PRODUCT

02:23:30.001 --> 02:23:31.803
DIRECTLY INTO THE ALTERNATES

02:23:31.869 --> 02:23:33.604
ANALYSIS --

02:23:33.671 --> 02:23:36.808
AND THEN IN A MAKE IT WITH A

02:23:36.874 --> 02:23:39.911
DECISION PENDING THE RESULTS

02:23:39.978 --> 02:23:41.579
CSUS -- SO

02:23:41.646 --> 02:23:43.481
THAT'S ONE ONE OP OPTION THAT

02:23:43.548 --> 02:23:46.317
COULD OCCUR --

02:23:46.384 --> 02:23:48.953
SO THE JUST FOR QUICK MENTION

02:23:49.020 --> 02:23:51.556
RIGHT THE END ABOUT SB FIVE OH

02:23:51.622 --> 02:23:54.192
NINE THE OTHER STATUTE THAT WAS --

02:23:54.258 --> 02:23:55.293
PASSED AS PART OF THE GREEN

02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:57.562
CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE PACKAGE.

02:23:57.628 --> 02:23:59.330
THE TOXICS INFORMATION CLEARING

02:23:59.397 --> 02:24:01.132
HOUSE THAT WAS CREATED UNDER

02:24:01.199 --> 02:24:04.002
THAT LAW UNIVERSALLY SEEN OUT BY

02:24:04.068 --> 02:24:07.905
THE EXPERTS AS NOT AT ALL USEFUL --

02:24:07.972 --> 02:24:09.674
AND MANY EXPERTS SAID THAT THE

02:24:09.741 --> 02:24:12.176
ORIGINAL VISION FOR THAT

02:24:12.243 --> 02:24:13.678
CLEARING HOUSE REALLY HAS BEEN.

02:24:13.745 --> 02:24:16.247
FULLY SUPERSEDED BY OTHER TOOLS

02:24:16.314 --> 02:24:18.649
THAT ARE NOW OUT THERE --

02:24:18.716 --> 02:24:20.318
SO SOME PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF

02:24:20.385 --> 02:24:22.453
THAT RECOMMENDED JUST GETTING

02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:23.921
RID OF THE TAX INFORMATION

02:24:23.988 --> 02:24:26.224
CLEARINGHOUSE ABOLISHING IT ALL

02:24:26.290 --> 02:24:27.525
TOGETHER --

02:24:27.592 --> 02:24:30.261
OTHERS SUGGESTED KEEPING IT BUT

02:24:30.328 --> 02:24:32.263
RESHAPING ARE SHIFTING THE

02:24:32.330 --> 02:24:34.065
MANDATE AND THE PURPOSE --

02:24:34.132 --> 02:24:37.402
AND SPECIFICALLY AN IDEA THAT

02:24:37.468 --> 02:24:38.870
CAME UP.

02:24:38.936 --> 02:24:39.971
I THOUGHT WAS VERY INTERESTING.

02:24:40.038 --> 02:24:41.439
OF RELATED TO THE HAZARD TRAITS

02:24:41.506 --> 02:24:43.908
ALSO MANDATED UNDER SB FIVE OH

02:24:43.975 --> 02:24:45.309
NINE THE HAZARD TRAITS WERE

02:24:45.376 --> 02:24:47.278
IDENTIFIED BY A WE HA.

02:24:47.345 --> 02:24:49.680
UP BACK IN.

02:24:49.747 --> 02:24:51.416
TWENTY THIRTEEN AND WERE PRAISED

02:24:51.482 --> 02:24:54.052
BY OUT MANY OF THE EXPERTS THAT

02:24:54.118 --> 02:24:55.820
I INTERVIEWED AS BEING VISIONARY

02:24:55.887 --> 02:24:59.057
AND VERY USEFUL AND FOUNDATIONAL.

02:24:59.123 --> 02:24:59.624
FOR FIRST SURVEY CONCEPTUAL

02:24:59.690 --> 02:25:04.062
FRAMEWORK ALL HAZARDS --

02:25:04.128 --> 02:25:06.164
AND TO SOME EXPERTS SUGGESTED

02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:07.598
TRANSFERRING THE TACTICS

02:25:07.665 --> 02:25:09.067
INFORMATION CLEARING HOUSE TO A

02:25:09.133 --> 02:25:09.934
WE HAVE.

02:25:10.001 --> 02:25:12.170
AND USING THE CLEARING HOUSE TO

02:25:12.236 --> 02:25:14.505
HOUSE INFORMATION ON CHEMICALS

02:25:14.572 --> 02:25:17.275
THAT ARE SCREENED USING NEW

02:25:17.341 --> 02:25:21.145
PREDICTIVE TOXICOLOGY METHODS.

02:25:21.212 --> 02:25:21.846
AND THIS HAS SOME BENEFITS WOULD

02:25:21.913 --> 02:25:23.414
ACTUALLY DRESS THREE PROBLEMS AT

02:25:23.481 --> 02:25:25.683
ONCE IT WOULD ADDRESS THE

02:25:25.750 --> 02:25:28.519
TOXICOLOGY DEEDED CAP THAT I

02:25:28.586 --> 02:25:30.021
MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY.

02:25:30.088 --> 02:25:31.789
IT WOULD REPURPOSE THE TOXICS

02:25:31.856 --> 02:25:33.458
INFORMATION CLEARING HOUSE AND

02:25:33.524 --> 02:25:35.359
GIVE IT A NEW LIFE.

02:25:35.426 --> 02:25:37.261
AND THIRDLY IT WOULD.

02:25:37.328 --> 02:25:38.496
ALLOW --

02:25:38.563 --> 02:25:40.731
SORT OF THE POTENTIAL TO UPDATE

02:25:40.798 --> 02:25:42.733
THE CANDIDATE CHEMICALS LIST

02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:44.068
OVER TIME.

02:25:44.135 --> 02:25:46.237
WITH NEW SCIENCE AS IT EMERGES

02:25:46.304 --> 02:25:48.606
SO FOR EXAMPLE --

02:25:48.673 --> 02:25:52.443
AT AND BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE --

02:25:52.510 --> 02:25:53.911
EXPERT SCIENTIST WHO I

02:25:53.978 --> 02:25:56.414
INTERVIEWED FROM OUT OF STATE

02:25:56.481 --> 02:25:58.015
SAID.

02:25:58.082 --> 02:25:59.650
SAID WE COULD BE DOING MORE WITH

02:25:59.717 --> 02:26:02.620
THE KENNEDY CHEMICAL CELESTE.

02:26:02.687 --> 02:26:04.188
EN ADDING AND THEY COULD BE

02:26:04.255 --> 02:26:06.190
ADDING CHEMICALS HAS THEY ASSESS

02:26:06.257 --> 02:26:08.559
THE HAZARD USING NOT JUST

02:26:08.626 --> 02:26:10.128
TRADITIONAL STUFF.

02:26:10.194 --> 02:26:13.364
THE PERSON MEANT TOXICOLOGY DATA

02:26:13.431 --> 02:26:15.733
BUT THE NEWER METHODS.

02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:16.701
SO THAT --

02:26:16.767 --> 02:26:19.403
THAT IDEA I THOUGHT WAS --

02:26:19.470 --> 02:26:22.039
INTERESTED A AN INTERESTING WAY

02:26:22.106 --> 02:26:24.475
TO MOVE THE SCIENCE FORWARD --

02:26:24.542 --> 02:26:25.343
AND THEN I MENTION THE

02:26:25.409 --> 02:26:29.547
TECHNOLOGY GAP A COUPLE TIMES --

02:26:29.614 --> 02:26:31.182
AND THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT --

02:26:31.249 --> 02:26:32.383
DOCTOR MULVIHILL TALKED ABOUT

02:26:32.450 --> 02:26:33.618
QUITE A BIT.

02:26:33.684 --> 02:26:35.820
AND UNFORTUNATELY IT IT WAS

02:26:35.887 --> 02:26:37.421
NEVER REALLY ADDRESSED --

02:26:37.488 --> 02:26:38.556
IN THE OR FROM THE ORIGINAL

02:26:38.623 --> 02:26:39.924
GREEN CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE

02:26:39.991 --> 02:26:40.992
VISION.

02:26:41.058 --> 02:26:42.627
AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

02:26:42.693 --> 02:26:44.829
IT'S THE CARAT TO THE SAFER

02:26:44.896 --> 02:26:48.032
CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM STICK --

02:26:48.099 --> 02:26:48.766
AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT

02:26:48.833 --> 02:26:50.401
OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA

02:26:50.468 --> 02:26:51.736
LEADERSHIP.

02:26:51.802 --> 02:26:53.638
IT'S ALSO AN ISSUE THE GENERATED

02:26:53.704 --> 02:26:56.107
ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE Z. AS IN

02:26:56.174 --> 02:26:58.009
FOR EVERY STAKEHOLDER THAT I

02:26:58.075 --> 02:26:59.443
SPOKE WITH --

02:26:59.510 --> 02:27:01.078
SAID THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT

02:27:01.145 --> 02:27:02.580
REALLY WAS.

02:27:02.647 --> 02:27:03.347
IN A VERY.

02:27:03.414 --> 02:27:05.583
VERY RECEIVE VERY WIDESPREAD

02:27:05.650 --> 02:27:08.486
ENTHUSIASTIC --

02:27:08.553 --> 02:27:11.522
ENDORSEMENT --

02:27:11.589 --> 02:27:13.424
SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT I

02:27:13.491 --> 02:27:14.592
THOUGHT WERE INTERESTING.

02:27:14.659 --> 02:27:15.426
OF ONE PERSON FROM AN NGO

02:27:15.493 --> 02:27:16.394
PERSPECTIVE SAID IT'S A LOT

02:27:16.460 --> 02:27:16.961
EASIER TO PUT PRESSURE ON

02:27:17.028 --> 02:27:17.995
SOMEBODY TO TAKE SOMETHING BAD

02:27:18.062 --> 02:27:19.764
OUT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO

02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:22.333
TURN -- TO

02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:23.734
AND ANOTHER ANOTHER COMMENT FROM

02:27:23.801 --> 02:27:26.237
ANOTHER NGO A PERSPECTIVE IT

02:27:26.304 --> 02:27:27.672
SAID WE NEED CAP WE NEED TO

02:27:27.738 --> 02:27:29.874
ASSIST CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES TO

02:27:29.941 --> 02:27:32.276
LEAD THE WORLD IN GREEN --

02:27:32.343 --> 02:27:33.611
DESIGN AND PRODUCTION.

02:27:33.678 --> 02:27:34.845
AND THEN IF THE PROGRAM ACTUALLY

02:27:34.912 --> 02:27:37.682
PRIORITIZE HAVE A SAFER

02:27:37.748 --> 02:27:40.318
SUBSTITUTE CAN INCENTIVIZE THE

02:27:40.384 --> 02:27:43.754
INDUSTRY TO COME UP WITH THAT.

02:27:43.821 --> 02:27:45.957
IF YOU FINISH IN THE NEXT MAN

02:27:46.023 --> 02:27:49.560
YEAH APPS ALMOST DONE OKAY --

02:27:49.627 --> 02:27:51.762
SO AND I AND SO BE OF PEOPLE

02:27:51.829 --> 02:27:52.997
ALSO POINTED TO THE BERKELEY

02:27:53.064 --> 02:27:53.631
CENTER FOR GREEN CHEMISTRY IS A

02:27:53.698 --> 02:27:54.765
MODEL THAT COULD BE EXPANDED

02:27:54.832 --> 02:27:56.467
COULD BE REPLICATED AT OTHER.

02:27:56.534 --> 02:27:57.969
CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES AND

02:27:58.035 --> 02:28:01.339
COLLEGES AND ALSO PEOPLE POINTED

02:28:01.405 --> 02:28:02.607
TO ONE CALIFORNIA LEADERSHIP AND

02:28:02.673 --> 02:28:04.842
CLEAN ENERGY AND THE BENEFITS

02:28:04.909 --> 02:28:06.477
THAT THAT'S BROUGHT TO OUR STATE

02:28:06.544 --> 02:28:06.944
WHICH IS A COMPARABLE

02:28:07.011 --> 02:28:07.979
OPPORTUNITY.

02:28:08.045 --> 02:28:09.280
SAID THOSE I THINK ARE THE

02:28:09.347 --> 02:28:12.116
OVERALL RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE

02:28:12.183 --> 02:28:13.351
REPORT AND TâM.

02:28:13.417 --> 02:28:14.719
AND I THINK THAT --

02:28:14.785 --> 02:28:17.455
OVERALL THE THE MESSAGE --

02:28:17.521 --> 02:28:18.956
AND FINDINGS OF THE REPORT ARE

02:28:19.023 --> 02:28:21.125
THAT THIS IS EXTREMELY STRONG.

02:28:21.192 --> 02:28:23.194
PROGRAM THAT WE ARE LUCKY TO

02:28:23.261 --> 02:28:25.329
HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THAT

02:28:25.396 --> 02:28:27.098
THERE IT'S IT'S NOT QUITE ALL

02:28:27.164 --> 02:28:28.699
THE WAY THERE AND THERE ARE SOME

02:28:28.766 --> 02:28:32.436
THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE. TO

02:28:32.503 --> 02:28:34.305
REALLY --

02:28:34.372 --> 02:28:37.208
RING THAT VISION FULLY TO

02:28:37.275 --> 02:28:39.210
FRUITION THAT WOULD --

02:28:39.277 --> 02:28:40.511
BILL THAT A STRONGER SAFER STE

02:28:40.578 --> 02:28:42.013
CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM A MORE

02:28:42.079 --> 02:28:43.414
RELEVANT CLEARING HOUSE IF

02:28:43.481 --> 02:28:44.882
CHEMICAL HAZARD TRAITS.

02:28:44.949 --> 02:28:46.217
AND A VIBRANT GREEN CHEMISTRY

02:28:46.284 --> 02:28:47.385
INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA SO THANK

02:28:47.451 --> 02:28:49.854
YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:51.522
THANK YOU DOCTOR SOLOMON FOR

02:28:51.589 --> 02:28:54.158
WORKING ON THIS PROJECT AND FOR

02:28:54.225 --> 02:28:58.262
THE OTHER ALL CO AUTHORS AS WELL.

02:28:58.329 --> 02:29:00.498
OF THIS IS SAM.

02:29:00.564 --> 02:29:01.299
MACHINE WASTE WHICH WE CAN HELP

02:29:01.365 --> 02:29:02.667
MAKE THE PROGRAM BETTER THAT'S

02:29:02.733 --> 02:29:04.935
VERY IMPORTANT TO US.

02:29:05.002 --> 02:29:07.571
I WANTED TO PARTICULARLY ASKING

02:29:07.638 --> 02:29:08.973
FOR A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ON THE

02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:11.575
IDEA SO WE HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE

02:29:11.642 --> 02:29:14.211
TO GET RID OF THE TOXIC LAST.

02:29:14.278 --> 02:29:15.079
FORTY CHANGE BRING IT TO ANOTHER

02:29:15.146 --> 02:29:18.683
DEPARTMENT AND USE PREDICTIVE

02:29:18.749 --> 02:29:20.451
OUR CHEMISTRY AGAIN.

02:29:20.518 --> 02:29:22.486
REVOLUTION WE HAVE WITH

02:29:22.553 --> 02:29:25.556
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WITH.

02:29:25.623 --> 02:29:26.657
A GREAT AMOUNT OF COMPUTER POWER

02:29:26.724 --> 02:29:29.293
HAVE GREAT BELIEF IN THAT SYSTEM.

02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:30.494
COULD YOU --

02:29:30.561 --> 02:29:31.796
MAYBE CONTRAST THOSE TWO

02:29:31.862 --> 02:29:34.131
ALTERNATIVES AND WHAT YOU SEE IS

02:29:34.198 --> 02:29:35.399
THE ADVANTAGE DO YOU SEE A A

02:29:35.466 --> 02:29:36.967
REAL ADVANTAGE IN.

02:29:37.034 --> 02:29:40.938
HAVING THIS LIST AND THEN OF

02:29:41.005 --> 02:29:42.606
CHEMISTRY.

02:29:42.673 --> 02:29:45.910
I THINK THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT --

02:29:45.976 --> 02:29:47.745
THE PREDICTIVE CHEMISTRY THE

02:29:47.812 --> 02:29:50.815
PREDICTIVE TOXICOLOGY.

02:29:50.881 --> 02:29:54.251
IS IS MOVING FAST AND THERE IS A

02:29:54.318 --> 02:29:56.487
GLOBAL VISION OF HOW TO MOVE

02:29:56.554 --> 02:29:59.023
THAT FORWARD SOME OF ITS DRIVEN

02:29:59.090 --> 02:30:00.891
BY -- INTO

02:30:00.958 --> 02:30:02.626
IT A RELUCTANCE TO TO DO AS MUCH

02:30:02.693 --> 02:30:04.628
ANIMAL TESTING HAS BEEN DONE THE

02:30:04.695 --> 02:30:06.297
AND AND THAT AND ALSO

02:30:06.364 --> 02:30:07.698
RECOGNIZING THE ENORMOUS.

02:30:07.765 --> 02:30:10.101
DELAYS AND BACKLOGS IF OF

02:30:10.167 --> 02:30:11.902
CHEMICAL TESTING --

02:30:11.969 --> 02:30:14.071
AND AND ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT

02:30:14.138 --> 02:30:16.006
THE ADVANTAGES OF SOME OF THE

02:30:16.073 --> 02:30:18.042
NEW MODELS --

02:30:18.109 --> 02:30:21.779
AND SO AS A STATE WE SHOULD BE

02:30:21.846 --> 02:30:23.180
ON THAT TRAIN.

02:30:23.247 --> 02:30:29.387
AND WE SHOULD BE ACTUALLY NO.

02:30:29.453 --> 02:30:31.122
BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE WITH

02:30:31.188 --> 02:30:34.592
THE IN CALLEY PA. TO TAKE

02:30:34.658 --> 02:30:36.660
ADVANTAGE OF THE SIN OF THIS NEW

02:30:36.727 --> 02:30:38.462
FIREHOSE OF DATA THAT'S COMING

02:30:38.529 --> 02:30:39.230
OUT.

02:30:39.296 --> 02:30:41.298
IN USING IT FOR GOOD TO HEAR AT

02:30:41.365 --> 02:30:43.000
THIS IS A BASIS FOR GOOD

02:30:43.067 --> 02:30:44.034
DECISIONS.

02:30:44.101 --> 02:30:46.604
AND IT'S GREAT BECAUSE WE CAN

02:30:46.670 --> 02:30:48.038
ACTUALLY COVER.

02:30:48.105 --> 02:30:49.640
LITERALLY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

02:30:49.707 --> 02:30:52.843
CHEMICALS WE WERE AS WERE

02:30:52.910 --> 02:30:54.845
TALKING ABOUT MANY FEWER WITH

02:30:54.912 --> 02:30:57.815
STANDARD TOXICOLOGY TESTING SO

02:30:57.882 --> 02:30:59.350
WITH THEIR SO I THINK THE ISSUE

02:30:59.417 --> 02:31:01.085
IS.

02:31:01.152 --> 02:31:03.454
IF WE WANT TO DO THAT. ONE WAY

02:31:03.521 --> 02:31:05.523
TO DO IT WOULD BE TO USE THIS

02:31:05.589 --> 02:31:07.091
TOXICS INFORMATION CLEARING

02:31:07.158 --> 02:31:08.259
HOUSE COMBINED WITH THE HAZARD

02:31:08.325 --> 02:31:09.960
TRAITS TO HELP SORT OF GIVE THAT

02:31:10.027 --> 02:31:10.494
A LITTLE.

02:31:10.561 --> 02:31:14.064
SEND OFF A LITTLE NUDGE TO HELP --

02:31:14.131 --> 02:31:15.699
MAKE IT HAPPEN THERE WOULD BE

02:31:15.766 --> 02:31:17.802
OTHER WAYS TO DO IT SO I DON'T

02:31:17.868 --> 02:31:20.471
THINK THAT THIS IS THE ONLY ONE

02:31:20.538 --> 02:31:21.739
WAY TO THINK ONLY WHERE OUR

02:31:21.806 --> 02:31:22.907
POLITICIANS WERE GONNA DEPEND

02:31:22.973 --> 02:31:24.475
UPON -- YOU

02:31:24.542 --> 02:31:26.877
AND OTHERS TO DO.

02:31:26.944 --> 02:31:27.711
SO.

02:31:27.778 --> 02:31:28.979
CENTER ALLEN IS LOOKING AT THIS

02:31:29.046 --> 02:31:32.116
IN HIS BILL AND I WOULD JUST SAY --

02:31:32.183 --> 02:31:36.987
PLEASE HELP US --

02:31:37.054 --> 02:31:37.655
MAKE SOME GOOD DECISIONS IN THIS

02:31:37.721 --> 02:31:39.757
AREA AND I KNOW AS A SCIENTIST

02:31:39.824 --> 02:31:41.492
WE ALWAYS SAY ON THE ONE HAND ON

02:31:41.559 --> 02:31:43.227
THE OTHER HAND BECAUSE THE OTHER

02:31:43.294 --> 02:31:44.428
SCIENTISTS ARE GOING TO GET

02:31:44.495 --> 02:31:46.263
AFTER REST.

02:31:46.330 --> 02:31:48.999
IF WE SAY THERE'S CERTAINTY --

02:31:49.066 --> 02:31:51.702
BUT I REALLY THINK WE NEED YOUR

02:31:51.769 --> 02:31:54.004
BEST JUDGMENT AND WE CAN --

02:31:54.071 --> 02:31:55.372
GO THROUGH THAT AT ANOTHER TIME

02:31:55.439 --> 02:31:58.442
BUT IF YOU COULD HELP US --

02:31:58.509 --> 02:32:00.411
CONSIDER THAT I I I AM A GREAT

02:32:00.478 --> 02:32:01.745
BELIEVER.

02:32:01.812 --> 02:32:03.247
THAT WE WILL NEVER HAVE ENOUGH

02:32:03.314 --> 02:32:05.249
MONEY AND TIME TO DO ALL OF THE

02:32:05.316 --> 02:32:07.751
EXPERIMENTS WE NEED TO DO PLUS

02:32:07.818 --> 02:32:09.119
WE HAVE.

02:32:09.186 --> 02:32:10.955
CONCERNS ABOUT THE LAB ANIMALS

02:32:11.021 --> 02:32:14.358
IT CETERA AND SO I THINK WE NEED

02:32:14.425 --> 02:32:16.494
TO ENCOURAGE THIS APPROACH AND I

02:32:16.560 --> 02:32:19.296
WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE IT --

02:32:19.363 --> 02:32:21.398
TELL THANK YOU AND I THINK ONE

02:32:21.465 --> 02:32:22.633
PROBLEM WITH THAT THAT OF COURSE

02:32:22.700 --> 02:32:24.969
IS THE CLEARING HOUSE IS UNDER

02:32:25.035 --> 02:32:27.538
RESOURCES --

02:32:27.605 --> 02:32:28.739
TO OR REALLY NOT.

02:32:28.806 --> 02:32:31.375
WE UNDER RESEARCH EVERYTHING

02:32:31.442 --> 02:32:35.179
JUST SO YOU'RE NOW --

02:32:35.246 --> 02:32:36.780
BUT YOU KNOW SO IS SO I THINK

02:32:36.847 --> 02:32:38.082
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO WAY

02:32:38.148 --> 02:32:40.985
THAT IF IT YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE

02:32:41.051 --> 02:32:42.686
FOR WERE ICY --

02:32:42.753 --> 02:32:44.488
IF A WERE MOVED TO A WE HAD THAN

02:32:44.555 --> 02:32:45.890
THAT THERE WOULD STILL BE A NEED

02:32:45.956 --> 02:32:48.526
FOR THAT FOR RESOURCES --

02:32:48.592 --> 02:32:49.560
TO TO TO TURN IT INTO SOMETHING

02:32:49.627 --> 02:32:53.931
THAT WOULD --

02:32:53.998 --> 02:32:57.201
THE THE YOU KNOW THANK SO --

02:32:57.268 --> 02:32:57.968
WE DEFINITELY GOING TO BE

02:32:58.035 --> 02:33:00.037
LOOKING AT THAT THE BUDGET AS

02:33:00.104 --> 02:33:02.373
WELL ARTS CENTER ALLEN DID YOU

02:33:02.439 --> 02:33:05.476
HAVE A COMMENT YEAH WELL I I

02:33:05.543 --> 02:33:06.477
JUST WANNA ASK YOU MEAN A PIGGY

02:33:06.544 --> 02:33:07.311
BACKING ON THE QUESTIONS OF THE

02:33:07.378 --> 02:33:08.679
CHAIR -- YOU

02:33:08.746 --> 02:33:10.381
HAVE SOME FOLKS CALLING FOR THE

02:33:10.447 --> 02:33:11.448
ALL THE ALL.

02:33:11.515 --> 02:33:12.950
ALL THE ELIMINATION THE TCL

02:33:13.017 --> 02:33:14.752
TOGETHER.

02:33:14.818 --> 02:33:16.587
OUT WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE

02:33:16.654 --> 02:33:16.887
[inaudible]

02:33:16.954 --> 02:33:19.390
AS DID YOU SEE ANY VALUE IN THE

02:33:19.456 --> 02:33:20.824
CLEARING HOUSE AS IT STANDS

02:33:20.891 --> 02:33:21.959
RIGHT NOW AND AND IF IT WERE TO

02:33:22.026 --> 02:33:23.527
BE ELIMINATED.

02:33:23.594 --> 02:33:24.628
I IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE

02:33:24.695 --> 02:33:26.430
WOULD NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:33:26.497 --> 02:33:29.233
WOULD REPLICATE ELSEWHERE WERE

02:33:29.300 --> 02:33:30.401
FOUR HOUSE ELSE WHERE.

02:33:30.467 --> 02:33:32.636
ARE YOU KNOW.

02:33:32.703 --> 02:33:34.705
BECAUSE GETTING RID OF AN ENTIRE.

02:33:34.772 --> 02:33:35.339
ENTITY WITHIN THIS

02:33:35.406 --> 02:33:37.041
INFRASTRUCTURE MAY HAVE CAUSE

02:33:37.107 --> 02:33:38.108
UNFORESEEN.

02:33:38.175 --> 02:33:40.377
CONSEQUENCES.

02:33:40.444 --> 02:33:41.045
OR OR MAYBE NOT --

02:33:41.111 --> 02:33:42.279
YOU'VE LOOKED INTO A VERY

02:33:42.346 --> 02:33:43.581
INTENTLY YEAH I MEAN THE

02:33:43.647 --> 02:33:45.115
CLEARING HOUSE ITSELF AS IT

02:33:45.182 --> 02:33:46.216
EXISTS NOW --

02:33:46.283 --> 02:33:48.786
COULD BE ELIMINATED WITH REALLY

02:33:48.852 --> 02:33:50.788
MEAN. TO BE HONEST NO ADVERSE

02:33:50.854 --> 02:33:52.489
CONSEQUENCES IT'S NOT.

02:33:52.556 --> 02:33:53.324
IT'S NOT --

02:33:53.390 --> 02:33:54.959
PROVIDING ADDED BENEFIT IN ITS

02:33:55.025 --> 02:33:57.261
CURRENT FORM AND SO WHEN YOU

02:33:57.328 --> 02:33:58.729
HAVE SOMETHING.

02:33:58.796 --> 02:34:00.197
THAT'S NOT PROVIDING ADEQUATE

02:34:00.264 --> 02:34:02.166
BEYOND ANY BENEFIT YOU CAN

02:34:02.232 --> 02:34:06.437
ELIMINATE IT FOR YOU CAN SORT OF

02:34:06.503 --> 02:34:07.771
TAKE IT AND THINK WELL WHAT DO

02:34:07.838 --> 02:34:10.507
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT COULD THIS BE.

02:34:10.574 --> 02:34:12.009
THAT IS NEEDED AND THEN

02:34:12.076 --> 02:34:14.612
TRANSFORM IT AND I THINK BOTH

02:34:14.678 --> 02:34:16.580
ARE REASONABLE --

02:34:16.647 --> 02:34:19.116
PERSPECTIVES AND I CERTAINLY

02:34:19.183 --> 02:34:20.618
FROM THE EXPERTS THAT I

02:34:20.684 --> 02:34:22.319
INTERVIEWED THERE WAS NOT A

02:34:22.386 --> 02:34:23.687
CONSENSUS ON THIS ISSUE.

02:34:23.754 --> 02:34:27.358
MY MY FEELING --

02:34:27.424 --> 02:34:29.493
AND THIS IS JUST ME I'M MUCH

02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:30.828
MORE MY BIAS --

02:34:30.894 --> 02:34:32.329
SCIENTIFICALLY IS THAT I FEEL

02:34:32.396 --> 02:34:33.230
THAT THERE.

02:34:33.297 --> 02:34:37.801
THE THAT THE SB --

02:34:37.868 --> 02:34:38.402
FIVE OH NINE MANDATED THAT A

02:34:38.469 --> 02:34:39.637
WEEK HA.

02:34:39.703 --> 02:34:41.138
ARTICULATE HAZARD TRAITS OF

02:34:41.205 --> 02:34:43.474
CHEMICALS AND WE HAD DID IT IN A

02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:45.342
WAY THAT RECOGNIZED WHERE'S THE

02:34:45.409 --> 02:34:47.811
SCIENCE WAS GOING.

02:34:47.878 --> 02:34:49.046
AND INCORPORATES THESE THROUGH

02:34:49.113 --> 02:34:52.516
PREDICTIVE METHODS --

02:34:52.583 --> 02:34:54.184
AND IT -- IT

02:34:54.251 --> 02:34:57.755
WOULD BE A NICE FIT. TO USED. TO

02:34:57.821 --> 02:34:59.523
REPURPOSE THE CLEARING HOUSE TO

02:34:59.590 --> 02:35:01.425
HOUSE INFORMATION ON CHEMICALS

02:35:01.492 --> 02:35:03.027
THEY'RE NOT.

02:35:03.093 --> 02:35:05.896
ON THE KENNEDY CHEMICALS LIST --

02:35:05.963 --> 02:35:07.331
BECAUSE THEY DON'T RISE TO THAT

02:35:07.398 --> 02:35:09.533
LEVEL BUT WHERE THERE'S

02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:11.201
INFORMATION FROM PREDICTIVE

02:35:11.268 --> 02:35:13.404
TOXICOLOGY THAT MIGHT RAISE

02:35:13.470 --> 02:35:14.738
FLAGS AND THEN THAT WOULD BE A

02:35:14.805 --> 02:35:16.306
RESOURCE FOR EXAMPLE FOR

02:35:16.373 --> 02:35:17.508
COMPANIES.

02:35:17.574 --> 02:35:18.008
THEY'RE DOING ALTERNATES

02:35:18.075 --> 02:35:19.677
ANALYSES AND THEY'RE TRYING TO

02:35:19.743 --> 02:35:21.512
FIGURE OUT A CALF GOT THESE

02:35:21.578 --> 02:35:22.046
SEVEN CHEMICALS THAT I'M

02:35:22.112 --> 02:35:24.481
CONSIDERING AS SUBSTITUTES.

02:35:24.548 --> 02:35:28.152
LET'S SEE IF ANY OF THEM XIN

02:35:28.218 --> 02:35:29.953
CLEARING HOUSE AS FLAG WITH

02:35:30.020 --> 02:35:33.190
HAZARD TRAITS BECAUSE THEN THAT

02:35:33.257 --> 02:35:34.591
THAT TO CONSIDERATION SO IT'S

02:35:34.658 --> 02:35:37.361
UNFOLDS IN AND AND BOOSTS.

02:35:37.428 --> 02:35:39.063
MAKES THE ACT ALTERNATES

02:35:39.129 --> 02:35:40.898
ANNOUNCES A LITTLE EASIER.

02:35:40.964 --> 02:35:41.865
ON CRIME.

02:35:41.932 --> 02:35:43.233
RIGHT WILL WHAT I THINK WILL BE

02:35:43.300 --> 02:35:44.134
WILL WANT TO CONNECT WITH THE

02:35:44.201 --> 02:35:46.870
UNSERVED TALK MORE ABOUT THE

02:35:46.937 --> 02:35:49.707
SPECIFICS BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOUR

02:35:49.773 --> 02:35:52.309
RENT CHAIRS RIGHT YOU'VE YOU'VE.

02:35:52.376 --> 02:35:52.976
FIVE ACTIVELY PRESENT ALWAYS OF

02:35:53.043 --> 02:35:54.011
A PERSPECTIVES THAT ARE OUT

02:35:54.078 --> 02:35:54.945
THERE BUT BUT HOW DO WE MAKE

02:35:55.012 --> 02:35:55.713
SURE THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO

02:35:55.779 --> 02:35:57.247
MOVE AHEAD WITH THE WOMEN IN THE

02:35:57.314 --> 02:36:00.751
CLEARING HOUSE WE THAT WE AND

02:36:00.818 --> 02:36:00.951
I'LL.

02:36:01.018 --> 02:36:02.986
BE.

02:36:03.053 --> 02:36:05.122
TRANSFER MAYBE THE HAZARD TRAITS

02:36:05.189 --> 02:36:05.923
MAYBE THAT'S THE KIND OF THE

02:36:05.989 --> 02:36:07.324
BETSY THAT IS A CRITICAL

02:36:07.391 --> 02:36:09.226
COMPONENT YEAH OKAY.

02:36:09.293 --> 02:36:10.360
THAT'S THAT'S ON THE THE OTHER

02:36:10.427 --> 02:36:11.028
THING I WAS ASKED I WAS THINKING

02:36:11.095 --> 02:36:13.130
ABOUT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DATA

02:36:13.197 --> 02:36:14.698
GAP AND YOU KNOW --

02:36:14.765 --> 02:36:17.401
PUTTING A LITTLE MORE TEETH INTO

02:36:17.468 --> 02:36:21.705
THE THE IN A THE THE THE THE

02:36:21.772 --> 02:36:23.807
ABILITY OF THE REGULATORS TO GET

02:36:23.874 --> 02:36:25.642
THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED.

02:36:25.709 --> 02:36:27.111
TO MAKE THEIR FINDINGS AND

02:36:27.177 --> 02:36:28.579
DETERMINATIONS.

02:36:28.645 --> 02:36:30.280
HAVE YOU SEEN OUT THERE KIND OF

02:36:30.347 --> 02:36:31.749
A BEST PRACTICES WITH AGGRESSIVE

02:36:31.815 --> 02:36:34.251
ENFORCEMENT OUT MAYBE ELSEWHERE

02:36:34.318 --> 02:36:36.587
IN MAYBE IN EUROPE OR OR

02:36:36.653 --> 02:36:40.190
ELSEWHERE --

02:36:40.257 --> 02:36:41.225
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I I

02:36:41.291 --> 02:36:42.159
DIDN'T LOOK A LOT AT THE

02:36:42.226 --> 02:36:47.164
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS --

02:36:47.231 --> 02:36:48.899
A IN OKAY SOUNDS LIKE.

02:36:48.966 --> 02:36:50.300
HE CAN ASK BUT THEY'RE OUT THERE

02:36:50.367 --> 02:36:52.102
YOU KNOW.

02:36:55.239 --> 02:36:57.407
TIME IN --

02:36:57.474 --> 02:36:59.209
THE EUROPE BUT I THINK IT DOES

02:36:59.276 --> 02:37:00.677
HAVE PRETTY STRONG --

02:37:00.744 --> 02:37:02.179
ENFORCEMENT ABILITIES CENTER

02:37:02.246 --> 02:37:03.847
REACH AND THEY HAVE BEEN VERY

02:37:03.914 --> 02:37:05.315
EFFECTIVE FAT.

PENALTIES OR WHAT.

02:37:13.323 --> 02:37:16.293
WHAT'S IT'S RIGHT NOW BUT THAT

02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:18.629
SOMETHING COULD EASILY FIND OUT

02:37:18.695 --> 02:37:20.964
GET BACK TO YOU ON OKAY.

GROUNDBREAKING.

02:44:02.666 --> 02:44:03.500
FAR TOO OFTEN WHEN UNSAFE

02:44:03.567 --> 02:44:05.001
CHEMICALS ARE IDENTIFIED AND

02:44:05.068 --> 02:44:06.303

02:44:40.637 --> 02:44:42.272
THIS PROGRAM FOCUSES NOT ONLY ON

02:44:42.339 --> 02:44:44.007
WHAT CHEMICALS TO REMOVE BUT

02:44:44.074 --> 02:44:46.243
ALSO REQUIRES INDUSTRY TO

02:44:46.309 --> 02:44:47.477
CONDUCT ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENT

02:44:47.544 --> 02:44:49.246

AS AN ASIDE OUR ORGANIZATION IS

02:45:57.213 --> 02:45:58.381
ALSO GONNA BE LOOKING AT

02:45:58.448 --> 02:46:00.150
LEGISLATION TO TRY TO TO REQUIRE

02:46:00.216 --> 02:46:01.318

FINALLY WHILE WE STRONGLY

02:46:19.402 --> 02:46:20.370
SUPPORT THE SAFER CONSUMER

02:46:20.437 --> 02:46:21.971
PRODUCTS PROGRAM NO MATTER HOW

02:46:22.038 --> 02:46:23.506
EFFICIENT THE PROGRAM BECOMES IT

02:46:23.573 --> 02:46:24.874
WILL NEVER ADDRESS THE VAST

02:46:24.941 --> 02:46:26.710
ARRAY OF PRODUCTS CONTAINING

02:46:26.776 --> 02:46:28.345
CHEMICALS OF CONCERN.

02:46:28.411 --> 02:46:29.946
THIS LEGISLATURE MUST ALSO PLAY

02:46:30.013 --> 02:46:31.581
ITS ROLE IN PROTECTING

02:46:31.648 --> 02:46:33.483
CALIFORNIANS BY RESTRICTING.

02:46:33.550 --> 02:46:34.150
UNSAFE CHEMICAL EXPOSURES

02:46:34.217 --> 02:46:37.387
PARTICULARLY LOCALS THAT CAUSING

02:46:37.454 --> 02:46:38.722
GREAT HARM AND FOR WHICH SAFER

02:46:38.788 --> 02:46:40.256
ALTERNATIVES ARE CLEARLY

02:46:40.323 --> 02:46:41.891
AVAILABLE.

02:46:41.958 --> 02:46:42.892
THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY

02:46:42.959 --> 02:46:44.928
TO TESTIFY WE LOOK FORWARD TO

02:46:44.994 --> 02:46:45.995
WORKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AND

02:46:46.062 --> 02:46:47.430
THIS AND THE LEGISLATURE TO

02:46:47.497 --> 02:46:48.998
PROVIDE THE NECESSARY AUTHORITY

02:46:49.065 --> 02:46:51.267
AND RESOURCES. TO FULLY REALIZE

02:46:51.334 --> 02:46:52.936
THE ENORMOUS POTENTIAL OF THE

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SO

02:46:57.607 --> 02:46:59.776
MUCH APPRECIATE THAT.

02:46:59.843 --> 02:47:01.144
SO NOW WE HEAR OF AN INDUSTRY

02:47:01.211 --> 02:47:02.679
SIDE PERSPECTIVE AND AND WE HAVE

CALIFORNIA.

02:47:18.228 --> 02:47:19.396
I'M ALSO ON THE STEERING

02:47:19.462 --> 02:47:20.830
COMMITTEE OF THE GREEN CHEMISTRY

OF OTHER COMPANIES AND TRADE

02:47:25.368 --> 02:47:26.503
ASSOCIATIONS.

02:47:26.569 --> 02:47:28.304
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH GREEN

CHEMISTRY STE --

02:47:29.339 --> 02:47:31.174
SINCE MIKE WILL SINCE TWO

02:47:31.241 --> 02:47:33.076
THOUSAND AND SIX REPORT.

02:47:33.143 --> 02:47:34.043
WHEN THE DISCUSSIONS LED TO THE

02:47:34.110 --> 02:47:35.311
GREEN CHEMISTRY BILLS IN TWO

02:47:35.378 --> 02:47:36.913
THOUSAND AND?

02:47:36.980 --> 02:47:37.881
EIGHT MANY OF US IN INDUSTRY

02:47:37.947 --> 02:47:39.449
ACTIVELY JOINED WITH OUR

02:47:39.516 --> 02:47:41.951
ENVIRONMENTAL COLLEAGUES.

02:47:42.018 --> 02:47:43.953
AND SUPPORTED THEIR PASSAGE.

02:47:44.020 --> 02:47:44.921
THE BILL'S DEMANDED A MORE

02:47:44.988 --> 02:47:46.289
HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE ON

02:47:46.356 --> 02:47:48.625
CHEMICALS WE RECOGNIZE THAT WITH

02:47:48.691 --> 02:47:50.059
TAKE A DEDICATED STAFF OF

02:47:50.126 --> 02:47:51.361
SCIENTISTS.

02:47:51.428 --> 02:47:52.429
OPENED INPUT FROM ALL

02:47:52.495 --> 02:47:54.864
STAKEHOLDERS.

02:47:54.931 --> 02:47:56.499
INVESTING --

02:47:56.566 --> 02:47:58.301
INVESTING SIGNIFICANT TIME --

02:47:58.368 --> 02:47:59.969
IN ORDER TO DO JUSTICE TO THAT

02:48:00.036 --> 02:48:01.304
TASK.

02:48:01.371 --> 02:48:03.473
THIS WAS PREFERABLE IN OUR VIEW

02:48:03.540 --> 02:48:04.841
TWO A LEGISLATIVE PROCESS

02:48:04.908 --> 02:48:05.742
BURDENED.

02:48:05.809 --> 02:48:07.177
BY HAVING TO ADDRESS THOUSANDS

02:48:07.243 --> 02:48:09.145
OF BILLS IN VERY LIMITED TIME

02:48:09.212 --> 02:48:10.580
WITH LIMITED SCIENTIFIC

02:48:10.647 --> 02:48:12.048
EXPERTISE.

02:48:12.115 --> 02:48:13.917
THAT SIMPLY CANNOT DO JUSTICE TO

02:48:13.983 --> 02:48:15.819
THE MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT

02:48:15.885 --> 02:48:19.622
IS NOW BEING DEMANDED.

02:48:19.689 --> 02:48:21.024
WE WERE CONSCIOUS THOUGH THAT

02:48:21.090 --> 02:48:22.692
COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF

02:48:22.759 --> 02:48:24.794
POSSIBLE IMPACTS OF CHEMICALS

02:48:24.861 --> 02:48:25.695
AND THEIR ALTERNATIVES.

02:48:25.762 --> 02:48:27.230
WAS NEW TO REGULAR PROGRAM

02:48:27.297 --> 02:48:30.600
REGULATORY PROGRAMS IN THE US.

02:48:30.667 --> 02:48:32.402
AND VERY AMBITIOUS.

02:48:32.469 --> 02:48:33.837
WE RALLIED TO THAT CHALLENGE

02:48:33.903 --> 02:48:35.205
WITH ONE OF THE BROADEST AND

02:48:35.271 --> 02:48:37.073
DEEPEST EFFORTS EVER MOUNTED BY

02:48:37.140 --> 02:48:39.242
INDUSTRY TO ENABLE STATE LEVEL

02:48:39.309 --> 02:48:40.877
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY.

02:48:40.944 --> 02:48:42.111
THE GREEN CHEMISTRY ALLIANCE

02:48:42.178 --> 02:48:44.113
BROUGHT TO CALIFORNIA EXPERTISE

02:48:44.180 --> 02:48:46.883
FROM LEADING NATIONAL COMPANIES.

02:48:46.950 --> 02:48:48.818
AND TRADE ASSOCIATIONS THE AIM

02:48:48.885 --> 02:48:52.021
WAS AND STILL IS TO HELP DE TSC

02:48:52.088 --> 02:48:53.056
DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT

02:48:53.122 --> 02:48:54.424
REGULATIONS.

02:48:54.491 --> 02:48:55.592
THAT DO JUSTICE TO THE GREEN

02:48:55.658 --> 02:48:58.394
CHEMISTRY Là WAYS THAT ARE

02:48:58.461 --> 02:48:59.696
MANAGEABLE BOTH FOR THE

02:48:59.762 --> 02:49:00.763
DEPARTMENT.

02:49:00.830 --> 02:49:03.700
AND FOR INDUSTRY.

02:49:03.766 --> 02:49:05.368
THE PIONEERING CHARACTER OF THIS

02:49:05.435 --> 02:49:07.303
EFFORT PROVED TO BE DEMANDING AS

02:49:07.370 --> 02:49:09.239
HAS BEEN ALLUDED TO IT TOOK.

02:49:09.305 --> 02:49:10.640
FIVE YEARS FOR DTS SEE TO

02:49:10.707 --> 02:49:12.842
FINALIZE ITS INITIAL REGULATORY

02:49:12.909 --> 02:49:14.310
PACKAGE.

02:49:14.377 --> 02:49:16.212
THE LAWS MAYBE TEN YEARS OLD BUT

02:49:16.279 --> 02:49:17.680
THE TEN YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE

02:49:17.747 --> 02:49:19.582
SUSTAINABLE CONSUMER PRODUCT

02:49:19.649 --> 02:49:22.151
REGULATORY PROGRAM --

02:49:22.218 --> 02:49:25.989
WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL.

02:49:26.055 --> 02:49:26.556
TEN TWENTY TWENTY THREE THIS

02:49:26.623 --> 02:49:27.757
PROCESS IS REALLY FROM OUR

02:49:27.824 --> 02:49:31.027
PERSPECTIVE STILL IN ITS INFANCY.

02:49:31.094 --> 02:49:32.362
THAT SAID.

02:49:32.428 --> 02:49:34.030
WE ARE NOW FINALLY TESTING THE

02:49:34.097 --> 02:49:36.199
PROCESS AND FEEL MANY OF THE

02:49:36.266 --> 02:49:37.767
ISSUES POINTED TO AN DR

02:49:37.834 --> 02:49:39.135
SOLOMON'S REPORT.

02:49:39.202 --> 02:49:42.405
JUSTIFY ENGAGEMENT AND DIALOGUE.

02:49:42.472 --> 02:49:43.740
A HIGHLIGHT A FEW.

02:49:43.806 --> 02:49:44.841
WE SHARE THE VIEW THAT THIS

02:49:44.908 --> 02:49:46.576
PROCESS CAN AND SHOULD BE MORE

02:49:46.643 --> 02:49:47.744
EFFICIENT.

02:49:47.810 --> 02:49:49.312
AND ARE PREPARED TO ENGAGE WITH

02:49:49.379 --> 02:49:51.447
PTSD AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO

02:49:51.514 --> 02:49:53.650
ADDRESS THAT.

02:49:53.716 --> 02:49:55.051
GREATER CLARITY REGARDING THE

02:49:55.118 --> 02:49:57.387
EVALUATION PROCESS FOR SELECTING

02:49:57.453 --> 02:49:59.022
CANDIDATES CHEMICALS SHOULD BE

02:49:59.088 --> 02:50:00.623
AS COULD BE A START.

02:50:00.690 --> 02:50:02.058
AS WOULD EARLIER DIRECT

02:50:02.125 --> 02:50:03.726
ENGAGEMENT WITH KEY COMPANIES

02:50:03.793 --> 02:50:05.361
AND INDUSTRIES WHEN

02:50:05.428 --> 02:50:07.163
CONTEMPLATING SPECIFIC PRODUCT

02:50:07.230 --> 02:50:08.831
AREAS.

02:50:08.898 --> 02:50:10.833
WE BELIEVE THE PROCESS MAY ALSO

02:50:10.900 --> 02:50:13.303
BENEFIT FROM --

02:50:13.369 --> 02:50:15.939
ALLOWING STRATEGIC OFF RAMPS FOR

02:50:16.005 --> 02:50:17.874
COMPANIES OR INDUSTRIES THAT

02:50:17.941 --> 02:50:20.076
COMMIT TO PROPOSALS CLEARLY

02:50:20.143 --> 02:50:21.911
MEETING THE AIMS OF THE LAW.

02:50:21.978 --> 02:50:23.279
IMPORTANTLY THOUGH WE SEE SUCH

02:50:23.346 --> 02:50:24.948
REFINEMENTS AS BEING WITHIN THE

02:50:25.014 --> 02:50:28.184
SCOPE OF THE REGULATORY DOMAIN.

02:50:28.251 --> 02:50:30.353
WE DO NOT SEE LEGISLATIVE CHANGE

02:50:30.420 --> 02:50:32.322
AS A APPROPRIATE AT THIS

02:50:32.388 --> 02:50:34.424
JUNCTURE.

02:50:34.490 --> 02:50:36.092
WE NOTE THAT THE ISSUE OF DATA

02:50:36.159 --> 02:50:39.195
COLIN HAS BEEN RAISED --

02:50:39.262 --> 02:50:41.030
WE DO KNOW THAT DDT ESSIE

02:50:41.097 --> 02:50:42.765
ALREADY POSSESSES AUTHORITY FOR

02:50:42.832 --> 02:50:45.768
PRODUCT SPECIFIC DATA COLLINS --

02:50:45.835 --> 02:50:47.971
IT'S NOT TOTALLY CLEAR TO US WHY

02:50:48.037 --> 02:50:50.006
THE EXISTING AUTHORITY IS NOT

02:50:50.073 --> 02:50:51.507
ADEQUATE ALTHOUGH THAT'S BEEN

02:50:51.574 --> 02:50:54.777
SPOKEN TO TO A DEGREE TODAY --

02:50:54.844 --> 02:50:58.448
WE SUSPECT HOWEVER THAT THE IN

02:50:58.514 --> 02:51:00.183
THE END MAY NOT BE SOUGHT FOR

02:51:00.249 --> 02:51:01.784
THE TRADITIONAL NEED A BETTER

02:51:01.851 --> 02:51:04.654
UNDERSTANDING SPECIFIC PRODUCTS.

02:51:04.721 --> 02:51:06.723
BUT RATHER A MORE WHOLESALE CALL

02:51:06.789 --> 02:51:08.224
IN AT THE VERY BROAD RANGE OF

02:51:08.291 --> 02:51:09.525
PRODUCTS.

02:51:09.592 --> 02:51:10.426
WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE BEING

02:51:10.493 --> 02:51:12.729
FOCUSED UPON BY THE PROGRAM.

02:51:12.795 --> 02:51:15.431
AND IN OUR VIEW THAT WOULD BE A

02:51:15.498 --> 02:51:18.001
QUITE DIFFERENT CHALLENGE.

02:51:18.067 --> 02:51:19.502
AND YES WE TO SEE FUNDING AS AN

02:51:19.569 --> 02:51:20.903
ISSUE WARRANTING ATTENTION AND

02:51:20.970 --> 02:51:22.905
DIALOGUE DESPITE THE RESOURCE

02:51:22.972 --> 02:51:24.874
INFUSION THAT YOU APPROPRIATED

02:51:24.941 --> 02:51:26.376
LAST YEAR.

02:51:26.442 --> 02:51:28.811
IN THIS CONTEXT IT IS INDEED

02:51:28.878 --> 02:51:30.713
UNFORTUNATE THAT LARGER FUNDING

02:51:30.780 --> 02:51:32.281
QUESTIONS MAY BE LURKING IN THE

02:51:32.348 --> 02:51:34.817
BACKGROUND FOR DTS SEE.

02:51:34.884 --> 02:51:36.519
AS YOU ALLUDED TO AND AS YOU'LL

02:51:36.586 --> 02:51:38.321
BE DISCUSSING ON THE TWENTY

02:51:38.388 --> 02:51:39.355
SEVENTH.

02:51:39.422 --> 02:51:41.557
FINALLY WE CONTINUE TO OPPOSE

02:51:41.624 --> 02:51:42.859
LEGISLATIVE INTERVENTIONS THAT

02:51:42.925 --> 02:51:45.962
BYPASS CRITICAL AREAS OF THE SDP

02:51:46.029 --> 02:51:47.296
PROCESS.

02:51:47.363 --> 02:51:48.598
AS RECOMMENDED.

02:51:48.665 --> 02:51:50.566
THEY WOULD DIRECTLY OBSTRUCT THE

02:51:50.633 --> 02:51:53.002
FLOW OF THAT PROCESS.

02:51:53.069 --> 02:51:54.203
AND IMPEDE GAINING THE

02:51:54.270 --> 02:51:55.505
EXPERIENCE NEEDED FOR ITS

02:51:55.571 --> 02:51:57.640
IMPROVEMENT.

02:51:57.707 --> 02:51:58.941
MORE IMPORTANTLY.

02:51:59.008 --> 02:52:00.276
WE FEEL THAT THEY WOULD RUN THE

02:52:00.343 --> 02:52:02.145
RISK OF UNDERMINING THE AIM OF

02:52:02.211 --> 02:52:03.413
THESE LAWS.

02:52:03.479 --> 02:52:06.082
AND THROWING US BACK INTO AN ERA

02:52:06.149 --> 02:52:07.650
OF COMPETITION OF ONE OFF

02:52:07.717 --> 02:52:10.987
CHEMICAL BILLS.

02:52:11.054 --> 02:52:13.222
RATHER WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN

02:52:13.289 --> 02:52:15.792
WORK THROUGH THE WORK WITHIN THE

02:52:15.858 --> 02:52:17.760
PRESENT LAWS TO IMPROVE THIS

02:52:17.827 --> 02:52:19.162
PROCESS SIGNIFICANTLY.

02:52:19.228 --> 02:52:20.663
NOW THAT THE REGULATIONS ARE

02:52:20.730 --> 02:52:22.398
PLAYING OUT AND ENABLING THE

02:52:22.465 --> 02:52:24.567
NECESSARY LEARNINGS. FOR THAT

02:52:24.634 --> 02:52:26.869
REASON WE APPRECIATE THE

02:52:26.936 --> 02:52:28.671
INITIATIVE OF OUR COLLEAGUES.

02:52:28.738 --> 02:52:30.673
IN PUTTING THESE CHALLENGES BACK

02:52:30.740 --> 02:52:32.341
ON THE TABLE.

02:52:32.408 --> 02:52:34.544
WE THINK WE THANK THE COMMITTEES

02:52:34.610 --> 02:52:36.045
FOR INDULGING THIS.

02:52:36.112 --> 02:52:38.147
WE DO THINK IT'S TIMELY NOW THAT

02:52:38.214 --> 02:52:39.115
WE ARE FINALLY GAINING SOME

02:52:39.182 --> 02:52:41.918
EXPERIENCE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING

02:52:41.984 --> 02:52:43.252
THE REGULATIONS.

02:52:43.319 --> 02:52:44.253
THANK YOU.

02:52:44.320 --> 02:52:47.290
I AND MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE

02:52:47.356 --> 02:52:48.891
CHEMISTRY ALLIANCE WHO ARE HERE

02:52:48.958 --> 02:52:51.294
WILL BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS --

02:52:51.360 --> 02:52:53.496
QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE.

02:52:53.563 --> 02:52:55.998
THANK YOU SO MUCH APPRECIATE IT.

02:52:56.065 --> 02:52:57.366
OKAY AND I'M NEXT WE'LL HEAR

02:52:57.433 --> 02:52:59.268
FROM HELEN HOLDER WHOSE --

02:52:59.335 --> 02:53:01.270
WITH HEWLETT PACKARD ALSO MEMBER

02:53:01.337 --> 02:53:03.673
THE CREAM OF INSIGHTS PARA.

02:53:03.740 --> 02:53:04.307
HI THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE

02:53:04.373 --> 02:53:05.942
TODAY -- I

02:53:06.008 --> 02:53:07.744
AM A DISTINGUISHED TECHNOLOGISTS

02:53:07.810 --> 02:53:09.912
HP LABS AND I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF

02:53:09.979 --> 02:53:11.714
THE GREEN RIBBON SIGNS PANEL --

02:53:11.781 --> 02:53:13.449
I WANTED ALSO MENTION THAT I WAS

02:53:13.516 --> 02:53:14.383
ALSO POINTED TO THE NATIONAL

02:53:14.450 --> 02:53:16.352
ACADEMY OF SCIENCES PANEL ON STE

02:53:16.419 --> 02:53:18.621
CHEMICAL SUBSTITUTION AS WELL AS

02:53:18.688 --> 02:53:20.389
THE OECD WORKING GROUP.

02:53:20.456 --> 02:53:22.492
ON CHEMICAL SUBSTITUTION AND SO

02:53:22.558 --> 02:53:23.860
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT

02:53:23.926 --> 02:53:25.595
I'M PROBABLY YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

02:53:25.661 --> 02:53:27.363
KEY ARCHITECTS OF THE MODERN

02:53:27.430 --> 02:53:28.865
APPROACH TO CHEMICAL

02:53:28.931 --> 02:53:29.499
ALTERNATIVES ASSESSMENT THAT WE

02:53:29.565 --> 02:53:30.466
USE TODAY.

02:53:30.533 --> 02:53:31.667
BOTH AROUND THE WORLD AND IN

02:53:31.734 --> 02:53:33.803
CALIFORNIA AND I THINK THAT'S

02:53:33.870 --> 02:53:35.271
RELEVANT BECAUSE SOME OF THE

02:53:35.338 --> 02:53:36.873
THINGS I'M GONNA SAY PROBABLY --

02:53:36.939 --> 02:53:39.175
RELY ON SOME KNOWLEDGE ABOUT

02:53:39.242 --> 02:53:40.309
THAT.

02:53:40.376 --> 02:53:41.277
SO SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED

02:53:41.344 --> 02:53:43.279
TODAY ABOUT THE PACE OF THE

02:53:43.346 --> 02:53:44.747
PROGRAM ESPECIALLY THE SAFER

02:53:44.814 --> 02:53:46.149
CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM.

02:53:46.215 --> 02:53:49.118
AND I'M CAREFUL TO SAY PACE AS

02:53:49.185 --> 02:53:50.419
OPPOSED TO SLOW.

02:53:50.486 --> 02:53:54.557
BECAUSE I THINK --

02:53:54.624 --> 02:53:56.292
SEE HOW THE HOW THE PROGRAM

02:53:56.359 --> 02:53:57.393
WORKS.

02:53:57.460 --> 02:53:59.028
IT IS FUNCTIONING AS IT WAS

02:53:59.095 --> 02:54:00.696
DESIGNED.

02:54:00.763 --> 02:54:02.465
AND THIS IS A A REALLY IMPORTANT

02:54:02.532 --> 02:54:04.634
POINT --

02:54:04.700 --> 02:54:06.202
THERE'S NOT BEEN A BIG --

02:54:06.269 --> 02:54:08.237
EXECUTION FAILURE THE DEPARTMENT

02:54:08.304 --> 02:54:09.305
ACTUALLY IS DONE AN OUTSTANDING

02:54:09.372 --> 02:54:11.174
JOB OF PUTTING THE PROGRAM

02:54:11.240 --> 02:54:13.910
TOGETHER AND STANDING IT UP --

02:54:13.976 --> 02:54:15.945
THROUGH THE STAKEHOLDERS OF BEEN --

02:54:16.012 --> 02:54:16.813
PRETTY RESPONSIVE ACTUALLY ALL

02:54:16.879 --> 02:54:18.047
THINGS CONSIDERED AND WE'RE NOT

02:54:18.114 --> 02:54:20.917
SEEING A AND VERY SIGNIFICANT

02:54:20.983 --> 02:54:22.251
DEADLINES MISS WAS NOT

02:54:22.318 --> 02:54:23.553
CHARACTERIZED BY MISSING

02:54:23.619 --> 02:54:25.488
DEADLINES WHERE WE MIGHT THINK

02:54:25.555 --> 02:54:26.656
THAT PEOPLE WERE --

02:54:26.722 --> 02:54:28.825
MAYBE PROGRESSING SLOWLY SO SO

02:54:28.891 --> 02:54:30.793
WHY IS THE PROGRAM PROGRESSING

02:54:30.860 --> 02:54:32.361
AT THE SPEED THAT IT IS WHY ARE

02:54:32.428 --> 02:54:34.130
WE ONLY SEEN THE NUMBER OF

02:54:34.197 --> 02:54:35.698
CHEMICALS THAT WE'VE SEEN.

02:54:35.765 --> 02:54:37.500
AND SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD

02:54:37.567 --> 02:54:40.269
THE ADAGE YOU CAN HAVE IT FAST

02:54:40.336 --> 02:54:44.473
CHEAP OR RIGHT PICK ANY.

02:54:44.540 --> 02:54:45.041
TWO RIGHT SO IS CALLED THE

02:54:45.107 --> 02:54:45.608
TRIPLE CONSTRAINT IS A VERY

02:54:45.675 --> 02:54:46.475
COMMON WAY OF LOOKING A

02:54:46.542 --> 02:54:48.411
CONSTRAINED SYSTEMS WHICH THIS

02:54:48.477 --> 02:54:49.478
VERY DEFINITELY IS [inaudible]

02:54:49.545 --> 02:54:52.515
SO --

02:54:52.582 --> 02:54:53.616
THERE'S THIS TENSION BETWEEN THE

02:54:53.683 --> 02:54:55.484
RIGHTNESS OF THE ANSWER THAT

02:54:55.551 --> 02:54:56.919
WE'RE TRYING TO GET.

02:54:56.986 --> 02:54:58.354
WE WANT TO HAVE.

02:54:58.421 --> 02:55:00.957
ALMOST NO CHANCE THAT SOME BAD

02:55:01.023 --> 02:55:03.059
OUTCOME WILL HAPPEN IF SOMETHING

02:55:03.125 --> 02:55:04.961
HAS GONE THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

02:55:05.027 --> 02:55:07.463
WE NATURALLY HAVE CONSTRAINED

02:55:07.530 --> 02:55:08.030
RESOURCES.

02:55:08.097 --> 02:55:10.399
AND THE ONLY THING REALLY

02:55:10.466 --> 02:55:13.069
LAUGHED. TO ACCOMMODATE IS SPEED

02:55:13.135 --> 02:55:14.804
AND SO THE SPEED THAT WE SEE THE

02:55:14.871 --> 02:55:17.039
PROGRAM PROGRESSING IS REALLY.

02:55:17.106 --> 02:55:19.108
THE NATURAL OUTCOME OF THE WAY

02:55:19.175 --> 02:55:20.576
THAT WE'VE STRUCTURED.

02:55:20.643 --> 02:55:22.078
SO WE HAVE OF VERY MUCH

02:55:22.144 --> 02:55:24.580
PRIORITIZE THE RIGHTNESS OF THE

02:55:24.647 --> 02:55:27.149
ANSWER THAT WERE SEEKING --

02:55:27.216 --> 02:55:28.251
AND THIS COMES BY ACTUALLY LIKE

02:55:28.317 --> 02:55:30.319
FROM THE BAND BILLS WE SAW WHAT

02:55:30.386 --> 02:55:31.621
HAPPENS IF YOU TAKE A SUBSTANCE

02:55:31.687 --> 02:55:32.755
USE RESTRICTED.

02:55:32.822 --> 02:55:34.957
AND YOU DON'T NECESSARILY LOOK

02:55:35.024 --> 02:55:36.492
AT THE ALTERNATIVES.

02:55:36.559 --> 02:55:37.960
OF YOU CAN END UP WITH SOMETHING

02:55:38.027 --> 02:55:39.095
THAT'S EVEN WORSE THAN THE

02:55:39.161 --> 02:55:40.863
ORIGINAL CHEMICAL OR THAT MOVES

02:55:40.930 --> 02:55:42.031
THE PROBLEM SO YOU MIGHT GET RID

02:55:42.098 --> 02:55:43.599
OF A CARCINOGEN.

02:55:43.666 --> 02:55:45.234
BUT THEN AND UP WITH --

02:55:45.301 --> 02:55:47.270
ACOSTA TOXICANT INSTEAD AND SO

02:55:47.336 --> 02:55:50.306
AS WE CREATED THE APPROACH TO

02:55:50.373 --> 02:55:52.475
CHEMICAL REGULATION WE WANTED IT

02:55:52.541 --> 02:55:53.776
TO BE VERY BROAD.

02:55:53.843 --> 02:55:54.977
WE WANT TO LOOK ACROSS MANY

02:55:55.044 --> 02:55:58.981
DIFFERENT IMPACTS.

02:55:59.048 --> 02:56:00.883
A BIG BECAUSE OF THAT WE SET THE

02:56:00.950 --> 02:56:01.884
BAR VERY HIGH FOR THE

02:56:01.951 --> 02:56:03.419
COMPREHENSIVENESS OF WHAT WE

02:56:03.486 --> 02:56:05.154
WANT THE PROCESS TO DO WHEN TO

02:56:05.221 --> 02:56:06.289
BE.

02:56:06.355 --> 02:56:07.456
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT WAYS OF

02:56:07.523 --> 02:56:09.392
ACCELERATING THE PROCESS WE HAVE

02:56:09.458 --> 02:56:10.760
TO REALLY LOOK AT THAT AS THE

02:56:10.826 --> 02:56:12.028
MAIN DRIVER.

02:56:12.094 --> 02:56:13.429
BECAUSE WE CAN ONLY PUT SO MUCH

02:56:13.496 --> 02:56:15.398
RESOURCES INTO IT THIS IS JUST

02:56:15.464 --> 02:56:17.099
THAT'S THE REALITY OF IT.

02:56:17.166 --> 02:56:19.502
AND SO IF WE WANT --

02:56:19.568 --> 02:56:21.037
TO GET MORE SPEED WE HAVE TO GO

02:56:21.103 --> 02:56:23.105
INTO SOME OF THESE OTHER OPTIONS

02:56:23.172 --> 02:56:24.874
THAT INCLUDE THINGS LIKE --

02:56:24.941 --> 02:56:28.077
WHERE CAN YOU INJECT INTO THE --

02:56:28.144 --> 02:56:30.313
PROCESS THAT MIGHT SACRIFICE A

02:56:30.379 --> 02:56:31.314
SMALL AMOUNT OF THAT

02:56:31.380 --> 02:56:32.982
COMPREHENSIVENESS BUT GET YOU A

02:56:33.049 --> 02:56:35.051
MUCH BIGGER OF ACCELERATION OF

02:56:35.117 --> 02:56:37.453
THE PROGRAM.

02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:38.020
NO WE DON'T WANT TO DO THIS

02:56:38.087 --> 02:56:40.389
MINDLESSLY AND SO AS A MEMBER OF

02:56:40.456 --> 02:56:41.390
THE GREEN RIBBON SIGNS PANEL I

02:56:41.457 --> 02:56:41.991
WOULD.

02:56:42.058 --> 02:56:44.393
SUGGEST THAT YOU RELY ON US TO

02:56:44.460 --> 02:56:46.062
HELP FIGURE OUT WHAT THOSE

02:56:46.128 --> 02:56:47.530
OPTIONS MIGHT BE.

02:56:47.596 --> 02:56:49.065
AND WHAT THE IMPACT MIGHT BE AND

02:56:49.131 --> 02:56:50.399
AS WE ASSESS ALL OF THE

02:56:50.466 --> 02:56:51.734
DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT ARE GOING

02:56:51.801 --> 02:56:52.735
TO BE COMING.

02:56:52.802 --> 02:56:54.270
OUT TO THE TABLE THAT WE SHOULD

02:56:54.337 --> 02:56:56.339
BE LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THE

02:56:56.405 --> 02:56:58.407
IMPACTS IN THE COMPLETENESS.

02:56:58.474 --> 02:56:59.141
OF THE ANSWER.

02:56:59.208 --> 02:57:00.142
ON IN THE RESOURCES REQUIRED TO

02:57:00.209 --> 02:57:03.646
DO THE EXPECTED SPEED THAT WE

02:57:03.713 --> 02:57:04.981
WOULD GET FOR MAKING THOSE

02:57:05.047 --> 02:57:07.183
CHANGES AND THAT WE USE THAT.

02:57:07.249 --> 02:57:08.951
AS A MAJOR --

02:57:09.018 --> 02:57:10.653
INDICATOR OF WHETHER WE SHOULD

02:57:10.720 --> 02:57:14.123
ADOPT A PARTICULAR CHANGE OR NOT.

02:57:14.190 --> 02:57:14.390
AND SO --

02:57:14.457 --> 02:57:17.493
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:57:17.560 --> 02:57:18.627
THANK YOU COULD YOU AT THE IF

02:57:18.694 --> 02:57:20.229
YOU WERE TO DESCRIBE SOMEONE IN

02:57:20.296 --> 02:57:25.234
THE ELEVATOR AND THEN OF NEW

02:57:25.301 --> 02:57:26.669
SAID WHAT'S THE RETIREMENT

02:57:26.736 --> 02:57:27.903
SCIENCE PANEL HOW HOW WOULD YOU.

02:57:27.970 --> 02:57:29.071
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT OF

02:57:29.138 --> 02:57:30.873
WHERE THE PANEL THAT ADVISES THE

02:57:30.940 --> 02:57:32.608
STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON --

02:57:32.675 --> 02:57:34.643
CHEMICAL REGULATION.

02:57:34.710 --> 02:57:37.046
AND IT'S MADE UP OF A MIX OF

02:57:37.113 --> 02:57:37.980
FOLKS WITH THAT WITH THE

02:57:38.047 --> 02:57:40.249
BREAKDOWN --

02:57:40.316 --> 02:57:42.118
ACTUALLY THAT'S A I WOULD HAVE

02:57:42.184 --> 02:57:42.685
TO DEFER TO THE TSC OF THE

02:57:42.752 --> 02:57:43.719
ACTUAL MEMBERSHIP BUT WE DO HAVE

02:57:43.786 --> 02:57:46.222
PEOPLE FROM INDUSTRY ACADEMIA

02:57:46.288 --> 02:57:47.690
AND SHE GOES --

02:57:47.757 --> 02:57:50.359
IT'S A BROAD GROUP OF YOU KNOW

02:57:50.426 --> 02:57:53.295
HOW MANY PEOPLE ON THE PANEL.

02:57:53.362 --> 02:57:56.665
TWO POINT. TWO TWELVE OKAY.

02:57:56.732 --> 02:57:59.101
HOW OFTEN DO YOU MEET --

02:57:59.168 --> 02:58:00.836
TWICE A YEAR.

02:58:00.903 --> 02:58:02.171

SACRAMENTO.

02:58:16.652 --> 02:58:19.422
THE MEETINGS ARE HERE AT

02:58:19.488 --> 02:58:21.390
MEETINGS ARE CONTANDO YES.

02:58:21.457 --> 02:58:24.126
OKAY THANK YOU PRESENT THAT --

02:58:24.193 --> 02:58:27.663
CORRECTION HERE FROM IV CAR

RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL.

02:58:36.038 --> 02:58:37.206
NRDC HAS A LONG HISTORY OF

02:58:37.273 --> 02:58:40.176
WORKING ON TOXIC AND ENSURING

02:58:40.242 --> 02:58:41.977
ROBUST LAWS AND PROGRAMS TO

02:58:42.044 --> 02:58:43.379
PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE

02:58:43.446 --> 02:58:46.182
RISKS FROM HARMFUL CHEMICALS --

02:58:46.248 --> 02:58:47.683
AND THEN OF COURSE CALIFORNIANS

02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:49.518
CONTINUE TO BE EXPOSED DALY DICK

02:58:49.585 --> 02:58:50.786

02:58:56.759 --> 02:58:58.094
WORKERS EXPOSED TO TOXIC

02:58:58.160 --> 02:58:59.929
CHEMICALS IN JOB SETTINGS

02:58:59.995 --> 02:59:02.631

CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM AND

02:59:08.237 --> 02:59:09.438
ITS MISSION OF MAKING PRODUCTS

02:59:09.505 --> 02:59:11.173
SAFER AND DRIVING INNOVATIVE

02:59:11.240 --> 02:59:13.542
CHEMISTRY IS THUS A PROGRAM OF

02:59:13.609 --> 02:59:15.878
GREAT INTEREST TO US.

02:59:15.945 --> 02:59:16.712
PART ME.

02:59:16.779 --> 02:59:18.013
AS DR SOLOMON'S REPORT SHOWS

02:59:18.080 --> 02:59:20.282
THAT THE PROGRAM HAS TREMENDOUS

02:59:20.349 --> 02:59:21.450
PROMISE --

02:59:21.517 --> 02:59:23.052
IT IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF

02:59:23.119 --> 02:59:25.121
ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM OF TOXIC

02:59:25.187 --> 02:59:27.056
CHEMICALS UP FRONT RATHER THAN

02:59:27.123 --> 02:59:28.257
AFTER THE FACT THAT IS

02:59:28.324 --> 02:59:29.825
PREVENTING TOXIC EXPOSURES IN

02:59:29.892 --> 02:59:31.227
THE FIRST PLACE.

02:59:31.293 --> 02:59:32.061
RATHER THAN CLEANING UP OR

02:59:32.128 --> 02:59:33.429
FIXING THE FACTS OF THAT

02:59:33.496 --> 02:59:35.297
EXPOSURE.

02:59:35.364 --> 02:59:36.232
IT REFLECTS AN APPROACH OF

02:59:36.298 --> 02:59:38.467
ASKING THE QUESTION OF WHETHER

02:59:38.534 --> 02:59:40.069
THE USE OF TOXIC CHEMICALS.

02:59:40.136 --> 02:59:41.470
OR CHEMICALS OF CONCERN IS

02:59:41.537 --> 02:59:43.038
NECESSARY.

02:59:43.105 --> 02:59:44.707
EVALUATING THE ALTERNATIVES AND

02:59:44.773 --> 02:59:45.741
MOVING US TOWARD SAFER CHEMICALS

02:59:45.808 --> 02:59:47.543
AND PRODUCTS ESPECIALLY WITH A

02:59:47.610 --> 02:59:49.078
VIEW TO THE PROTECTION OF

02:59:49.145 --> 02:59:50.379
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS.

02:59:50.446 --> 02:59:52.615
WE ARE HUGELY SUPPORT OF ALL

02:59:52.681 --> 02:59:53.516
THOSE GOALS.

02:59:53.582 --> 02:59:54.583
AND WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THE

02:59:54.650 --> 02:59:56.085
LEADERSHIP OF THE PROGRAM AND

02:59:56.152 --> 02:59:57.853
HEARTENED BY THE DIRECTION OF

02:59:57.920 --> 02:59:59.455
THE PROGRAM IS HEADED. FOR

02:59:59.522 --> 03:00:01.490
INSTANCE WITH AS EVALUATION OF

03:00:01.557 --> 03:00:03.425
STAND RESISTANT AND TOXIC TEFLON

03:00:03.492 --> 03:00:05.394
PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS AND

03:00:05.461 --> 03:00:06.562
CARPETS AND RUGS.

03:00:06.629 --> 03:00:07.997
THE PROGRAM IS TAKING ON A HUGE

03:00:08.063 --> 03:00:10.032
CATEGORY OF POTENTIAL EXPOSURE

03:00:10.099 --> 03:00:11.800
TO HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL --

03:00:11.867 --> 03:00:13.068
AND LOOKING AT THE WHOLE CLASS

03:00:13.135 --> 03:00:14.570
OF CHEMICALS ENSURE THAT WE

03:00:14.637 --> 03:00:15.871
DON'T END UP WITH A REGRETTABLE

03:00:15.938 --> 03:00:16.939
SUBSTITUTION.

03:00:17.006 --> 03:00:18.340
AND ON THE TOXIC TREADMILL WHERE

03:00:18.407 --> 03:00:19.975
ONE HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL AS

03:00:20.042 --> 03:00:21.377
REPLACEMENTS CYNICAL SIMILAR

03:00:21.443 --> 03:00:23.512
CHEMICAL WITH ALL THE ATTENDANT

03:00:23.579 --> 03:00:24.813
RISKS UP THAT'S AN ALL TOO

03:00:24.880 --> 03:00:26.248
FAMILIAR STORY.

03:00:26.315 --> 03:00:27.516
HOWEVER.

03:00:27.583 --> 03:00:30.186
BECAUSE OF A NUMBER HAS BEEN

03:00:30.252 --> 03:00:32.288
UNABLE TO DELIVER FULLY AND ITS

03:00:32.354 --> 03:00:32.988
POTENTIAL --

03:00:33.055 --> 03:00:34.890
FULLY ON ITS POTENTIAL AND SO

03:00:34.957 --> 03:00:36.058
THIS IS TO BE EXPECTED AS WE'VE

03:00:36.125 --> 03:00:37.626
HEARD FROM DOCTOR WILLIAMS AND

03:00:37.693 --> 03:00:38.994
FROM DR HOLDER --

03:00:39.061 --> 03:00:40.129
BUT THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL

03:00:40.196 --> 03:00:41.897
CONSIDERATIONS AT PLAY HERE AS

03:00:41.964 --> 03:00:43.699
WE'VE ALSO HEARD TODAY.

03:00:43.766 --> 03:00:45.334
IN A PERIOD OF TEN YEARS WE HAVE

03:00:45.401 --> 03:00:46.769
SEEN ONLY A HANDFUL OF PRODUCT

03:00:46.835 --> 03:00:48.270
CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS ADDRESSED

03:00:48.337 --> 03:00:49.872
IN ONLY ONE THAT HAS MADE IT ALL

03:00:49.939 --> 03:00:51.140
THE WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS.

03:00:51.207 --> 03:00:52.541
AND EVEN THAT AS WE HEARD

03:00:52.608 --> 03:00:54.376
EARLIER TODAY DID NOT RESULT IN

03:00:54.443 --> 03:00:55.711
REGULATORY ACTION.

03:00:55.778 --> 03:00:57.913
A NUMBER OF FACTORS ARE AT PLAY

03:00:57.980 --> 03:01:00.449
I'LL BRIEFLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE

03:01:00.516 --> 03:01:01.550
ONE KEY ISSUE FOR PERSPECTIVE AS

03:01:01.617 --> 03:01:03.085
YOU'VE HEARD TODAY IS DTS IS

03:01:03.152 --> 03:01:04.887
LACK OF ACCESS. TO PRODUCT

03:01:04.954 --> 03:01:05.988
INGREDIENTS DATA.

03:01:06.055 --> 03:01:07.923
PROGRAM STAFF HAVE HAD TO RESORT

03:01:07.990 --> 03:01:09.491
TO GOOGLE SEARCHES AND

03:01:09.558 --> 03:01:10.926
UNSUCCESSFUL VOLUNTARY INDUSTRY

03:01:10.993 --> 03:01:12.461
REQUEST TO GET INFORMATION

03:01:12.528 --> 03:01:14.263
PRODUCT INGREDIENTS.

03:01:14.330 --> 03:01:16.065
THE RESULT HAS BEEN LONG DELAYS

03:01:16.131 --> 03:01:17.600
AND HESITATION TO CONSIDER ALL

03:01:17.666 --> 03:01:19.602
THE PRINCIPAL INGREDIENTS MAKING

03:01:19.668 --> 03:01:21.604
A PRODUCT AND UNSAFE.

03:01:21.670 --> 03:01:22.104
THIS CLEARLY NEEDS TO BE

03:01:22.171 --> 03:01:23.372
ADDRESSED.

03:01:23.439 --> 03:01:25.040
WITH CLEAR ARE STRONGER DTC DATA

03:01:25.107 --> 03:01:26.775
COLLECTION AUTHORITY INCLUDING

03:01:26.842 --> 03:01:27.343
BACK TO THE CHEMICAL

03:01:27.409 --> 03:01:28.544
MANUFACTURER.

03:01:28.611 --> 03:01:29.845
THAT'S STILL PRESERVES THE TRADE

03:01:29.912 --> 03:01:31.513
SECRET PROTECTIONS THAT ARE

03:01:31.580 --> 03:01:32.114
ALREADY IN THE GREEN CHEMISTRY

03:01:32.181 --> 03:01:33.616
Là.

03:01:33.682 --> 03:01:35.084
A SECOND ISSUE IS A LACK OF

03:01:35.150 --> 03:01:36.785
DEADLINES AND OF CLEAR

03:01:36.852 --> 03:01:38.153
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROGRAMS

03:01:38.220 --> 03:01:40.389
OUTLINED TIME LINES FOR ACTION.

03:01:40.456 --> 03:01:41.457
WHICH WOULD DRIVE TRANSPARENCY

03:01:41.523 --> 03:01:45.060
AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

03:01:45.127 --> 03:01:45.661
THE CURRENT THREE YEAR WORK

03:01:45.728 --> 03:01:46.729
PLANS AND NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH TO

03:01:46.795 --> 03:01:48.497
BE MEANINGFUL.

03:01:48.564 --> 03:01:50.099
AND THUS FACILITATE THE LEND THE

03:01:50.165 --> 03:01:51.367
DELAYS --

03:01:51.433 --> 03:01:52.901
THAT HAVE BEEN UNFORTUNATE

03:01:52.968 --> 03:01:54.570
FEATURE OF THE PROGRAM TO DATE.

03:01:54.637 --> 03:01:56.338
IMPROVEMENTS ON THIS FRONT WOULD

03:01:56.405 --> 03:01:57.806
HELP WITH THE PRIVATIZATION

03:01:57.873 --> 03:01:59.508
PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS BUT DOCTOR

03:01:59.575 --> 03:02:01.844
SOLOMON HAS HIGHLIGHTED.

03:02:01.910 --> 03:02:03.245
A THIRD FACTOR LIKELY TO BECOME

03:02:03.312 --> 03:02:05.014
MORE PROBLEMATIC IF NOT

03:02:05.080 --> 03:02:07.249
CORRECTED IS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL

03:02:07.316 --> 03:02:08.751
APPROACH OF REQUIRING A NEW

03:02:08.817 --> 03:02:09.685
COMPANY DRIVEN ALTERNATIVES

03:02:09.752 --> 03:02:12.054
ANALYSIS FOR EVERY MANUFACTURER

03:02:12.121 --> 03:02:13.622
AND PRODUCT EVEN WHEN

03:02:13.689 --> 03:02:14.923
INFORMATION ALL HEART IS.

03:02:14.990 --> 03:02:16.792
IS ALREADY AVAILABLE FROM

03:02:16.859 --> 03:02:18.260
RELIABLE SOURCES.

03:02:18.327 --> 03:02:19.928
WE AGREED THAT WE DON'T WANT TO

03:02:19.995 --> 03:02:20.796
INTERRUPT THE FLOW OF THE

03:02:20.863 --> 03:02:22.931
PROCESS HOWEVER A FAST TRACK

03:02:22.998 --> 03:02:24.800
OPTION THAT ALLOWS THE AGENCY TO

03:02:24.867 --> 03:02:25.868
MOVE FASTER.

03:02:25.934 --> 03:02:27.236
WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR NOTICE

03:02:27.303 --> 03:02:28.671
AND COMMENT WHEN SUCH

03:02:28.737 --> 03:02:30.205
INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

03:02:30.272 --> 03:02:32.374
COULD SPEED UP THE PROCESS.

03:02:32.441 --> 03:02:32.941
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR LINE THE

03:02:33.008 --> 03:02:34.677
PROGRAM TO ADDRESS MORE OF THE

03:02:34.743 --> 03:02:35.778
HUGE UNIVERSE OF PRODUCTS AND

03:02:35.844 --> 03:02:36.979
CHEMICALS OUT THERE.

03:02:37.046 --> 03:02:38.947
IN A TIMELY MANNER.

03:02:39.014 --> 03:02:40.549
THE FAST TRACK PROCESS COULD

03:02:40.616 --> 03:02:41.116
ALSO REDUCE THE BURDEN AND

03:02:41.183 --> 03:02:42.885
COMPANIES ESPECIALLY ON MORE

03:02:42.951 --> 03:02:44.019
RESOURCE STRAPPED SMALLER

03:02:44.086 --> 03:02:44.887
COMPANIES.

03:02:44.953 --> 03:02:46.989
THAT WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE

03:02:47.056 --> 03:02:47.589
TO CONDUCT THEIR OWN ALL TURNS

03:02:47.656 --> 03:02:49.058
ANALYSIS.

03:02:49.124 --> 03:02:50.125
FINALLY AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY

03:02:50.192 --> 03:02:51.260
THERE'S A GREAT NEED FOR

03:02:51.327 --> 03:02:53.195
SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER AND MORE

03:02:53.262 --> 03:02:54.630
FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:02:54.697 --> 03:02:56.098
TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL.

03:02:56.165 --> 03:02:57.566
AND IT'S IMPORTANT MISSION OF

03:02:57.633 --> 03:02:58.667
PROTECTING THE HEALTH OF

03:02:58.734 --> 03:03:00.369
COMMUNITIES INCLUDING OF COURSE

03:03:00.436 --> 03:03:00.936
THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS

03:03:01.003 --> 03:03:02.604
PROGRAM.

03:03:02.671 --> 03:03:04.306
WHAT IMPROVEMENTS LIKE THESE AND

03:03:04.373 --> 03:03:07.343
MORE EFFICIENT PROCESS WE

03:03:07.409 --> 03:03:09.878
ON ITS VAST POTENTIAL AND WE

03:03:09.945 --> 03:03:10.512
LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU

03:03:10.579 --> 03:03:12.181
ON THAT?

03:03:12.247 --> 03:03:16.819
THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT HAD.

03:03:16.885 --> 03:03:18.754
ME IF YOU WANT ONE QUESTION WE

03:03:18.821 --> 03:03:20.322
TALK WITH THE LACK OF DEADLINES.

03:03:20.389 --> 03:03:21.490
ME DOES THIS RUN INTO THE

03:03:21.557 --> 03:03:25.561
PROBLEM THAT THE AND THAT --

03:03:25.627 --> 03:03:26.161
MISS HOLDER WAS TALKING ABOUT

03:03:26.228 --> 03:03:27.596
WITH REGARDS TO YOU KNOW YOU CAN

03:03:27.663 --> 03:03:29.431
EITHER BE FAT WILL FAST CHEAPER

03:03:29.498 --> 03:03:30.499
RIGHT PICK ANY.

03:03:30.566 --> 03:03:31.700
TWO IS IS THE ISSUE.

03:03:31.767 --> 03:03:33.035
HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU THINK THAT

03:03:33.102 --> 03:03:35.537
THIS DEADLINES --

03:03:35.604 --> 03:03:37.573
THAT THIS PROCESS TAKES TIME.

03:03:37.639 --> 03:03:39.007
AND THAT IS IT IN IN LESS YOU

03:03:39.074 --> 03:03:42.544
WANT TO BLOW UP THE BUDGET --

03:03:42.611 --> 03:03:46.148
SPEEDING THINGS UP. TO QUICKLY

03:03:46.215 --> 03:03:48.117
BECAUSE KIT CAN CAN LEAD TO

03:03:48.183 --> 03:03:50.219
ACCURACY PROBLEMS OR OR MAJOR

03:03:50.285 --> 03:03:51.954
COST PROBLEMS THAT WOULD REALLY

03:03:52.020 --> 03:03:53.255
CREATING A REASONABLE --

03:03:53.322 --> 03:03:54.923
I THINK WE WANT TO GET IT RIGHT

03:03:54.990 --> 03:03:56.392
AND IDEA ISN'T TO PUSH THE

03:03:56.458 --> 03:03:57.926
PROGRAM TO WORK FASTER THAN I

03:03:57.993 --> 03:03:59.661
CAN BUT TO HAVE CLEAR TIME LIES

03:03:59.728 --> 03:04:01.830
IN PLACE SO IF THE WORK PLAN FOR

03:04:01.897 --> 03:04:02.297
INSTANCE.

03:04:02.364 --> 03:04:03.766
LAYS OUT --

03:04:03.832 --> 03:04:05.401
HERE THE NUMBER OF CHEMICALS WE

03:04:05.467 --> 03:04:06.034
CAN ADDRESS IN THIS PERIOD OF

03:04:06.101 --> 03:04:08.337
TIME HERE ARE THE MARKERS FOR

03:04:08.404 --> 03:04:09.738
PROGRESS AND WHEN IT'S GOING TO

03:04:09.805 --> 03:04:10.472
GET DONE.

03:04:10.539 --> 03:04:13.142
THAT PROVIDES CLEAR TIME LINES

03:04:13.208 --> 03:04:14.209
THAT.

03:04:14.276 --> 03:04:15.611
THE REGULATED COMMUNITY AND

03:04:15.677 --> 03:04:17.613
STAKEHOLDERS CAN ACT UPON IT

03:04:17.679 --> 03:04:19.948
ALSO GIVES CLEAR GOALS --

03:04:20.015 --> 03:04:21.683
THAT THE AGENCY IS SETTING ITS

03:04:21.750 --> 03:04:23.519
OWN TIMELINE THAT SCENARIO BUT

03:04:23.585 --> 03:04:26.288
WITHIN A TIME FRAME SO IF SAY A

03:04:26.355 --> 03:04:27.122
FIVE YEAR TIME FRAME.

03:04:27.189 --> 03:04:29.158
BUT WITHIN THAT PERIOD THIS

03:04:29.224 --> 03:04:31.393
AGENCY CqC SET ITS OWN GOT

03:04:31.460 --> 03:04:33.095
GOLDEN TIME LIGHTS --

03:04:33.162 --> 03:04:34.329
AND DEVELOP THAT BASED ON THE

03:04:34.396 --> 03:04:35.164
NEEDS OF THE PARTICULAR PRODUCT

03:04:35.230 --> 03:04:36.765
CHEMICAL COMBINATION IT'S

03:04:36.832 --> 03:04:38.600
LOOKING AT SO I THINK THERE'S A

03:04:38.667 --> 03:04:39.368
WAY TO BALANCE THOSE TWO NEEDS

03:04:39.435 --> 03:04:41.003
WHAT WHAT'S STOPPING THEM FROM

03:04:41.069 --> 03:04:42.704
YOUR PERSPECTIVE.

03:04:42.771 --> 03:04:44.840
FROM IMPOSING.

03:04:44.907 --> 03:04:46.508
ADEQUATE DEADLINES --

03:04:46.575 --> 03:04:48.377
I THINK THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT

03:04:48.444 --> 03:04:51.046
AT THE MOMENT AND I THINK.

03:04:51.113 --> 03:04:51.246
YOU.

03:04:51.313 --> 03:04:52.581
GIVEN -- THE

03:04:52.648 --> 03:04:55.918
CHOICE ANYBODY WOULD TAKE TIME

03:04:55.984 --> 03:04:57.853
EXACTLY RIGHT AND I THINK OF

03:04:57.920 --> 03:04:58.821
HAVING SOME REASONABLE

03:04:58.887 --> 03:05:00.122
CONSTRAINTS ON THE DEADLINES AND

03:05:00.189 --> 03:05:01.623
TIME LINES --

03:05:01.690 --> 03:05:02.191
SO THAT YOUR DRESS A CERTAIN

03:05:02.257 --> 03:05:05.060
NUMBER OF PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS

03:05:05.127 --> 03:05:06.962
WOULD THEN AT A REASONABLE

03:05:07.029 --> 03:05:07.830
AMOUNT OF TIME.

03:05:07.896 --> 03:05:09.264
I THINK IS A FAIR APPROACH IT'S

03:05:09.331 --> 03:05:11.166
BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN MULTIPLE

03:05:11.233 --> 03:05:12.201
REGULATORY REGIMES THAT ARE

03:05:12.267 --> 03:05:14.303
WHERE WHERE WHERE WHERE YOU SEEN

03:05:14.369 --> 03:05:17.005
THAT IT WORKS WELL --

03:05:17.072 --> 03:05:18.340
THERE ARE DEADLINES AND IN PLACE

03:05:18.407 --> 03:05:20.142
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CLEAN AIR

03:05:20.209 --> 03:05:21.643
ACT THEIR DEADLINES IN PLACE

03:05:21.710 --> 03:05:23.078
UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT THEIR

03:05:23.145 --> 03:05:24.980
DEADLINES IN PLACE UNDER ALMOST

03:05:25.047 --> 03:05:27.416
ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LAW FOR THE

03:05:27.483 --> 03:05:27.683
AGENCIES.

03:05:27.749 --> 03:05:31.153
YES.

03:05:31.220 --> 03:05:34.890
AND THAT'S GOOD JUST AT THE

03:05:34.957 --> 03:05:36.692
CERTAIN JUST ON THAT POINT THE

03:05:36.758 --> 03:05:37.726
TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT

03:05:37.793 --> 03:05:38.594
WHICH WAS AMENDED AND AS I SAID

03:05:38.660 --> 03:05:39.394
HASN'T BEEN IMPLEMENTED WELL.

03:05:39.461 --> 03:05:40.596
DID PUT IN PLACE TIME LINES AND

03:05:40.662 --> 03:05:42.898
MINIMUM NUMBERS OF CHEMICALS

03:05:42.965 --> 03:05:43.832
THAT THE IT THAT THE EIGHT EPA

03:05:43.899 --> 03:05:44.800
SHOULD LOOK AT AND COMPLETE

03:05:44.867 --> 03:05:48.136
WITHIN A FIVE YEAR PERIOD SO.

03:05:48.203 --> 03:05:49.071
IT YOU KNOW.

03:05:49.137 --> 03:05:50.405
THERE ARE A LOT OF COULDN'T

03:05:50.472 --> 03:05:51.640
THERE ARE A LOT OF DEMANDS ON

03:05:51.707 --> 03:05:53.408
AND AGENCIES BOTH AT THE STATE

03:05:53.475 --> 03:05:54.877
LEVEL IN THE FAT FEDERAL LEVEL

03:05:54.943 --> 03:05:56.278
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE

03:05:56.345 --> 03:05:57.880
POKING ADAM TO DO THINGS IN A

03:05:57.946 --> 03:05:59.781
PARTICULAR WAY.

03:05:59.848 --> 03:06:01.016
AND I THINK HAVING THAT

03:06:01.083 --> 03:06:03.218
STATUTORY DEADLINE HELPS KEEP

03:06:03.285 --> 03:06:05.687
THINGS FOCUSED TO KEEP THINGS

03:06:05.754 --> 03:06:06.688
MOVING AND RISE.

03:06:06.755 --> 03:06:08.257
TO SORT OF TAMP DOWN SOME OF THE

03:06:08.323 --> 03:06:10.726
STATIC AROUND THE EDGES MISTER

03:06:10.792 --> 03:06:12.294
JACOBS AND SEE YEAH I JUST LIKE

03:06:12.361 --> 03:06:12.961
TO ENTER THIS DISCUSSION BRIEFLY

03:06:13.028 --> 03:06:15.264
BECAUSE I THINK --

03:06:15.330 --> 03:06:17.466
DOCTOR WILLIAMS OF ALLUDED TO IT.

03:06:17.533 --> 03:06:18.400
AN ISSUE THAT I THINK IS VERY

03:06:18.467 --> 03:06:20.068
RELEVANT OR HAS BEEN VERY

03:06:20.135 --> 03:06:21.737
RELEVANT --

03:06:21.803 --> 03:06:24.773
AND THAT IS SIMPLY THAT.

03:06:24.840 --> 03:06:28.176
THAT OUT THERE.

03:06:28.243 --> 03:06:30.212
AND I THINK.

03:06:30.279 --> 03:06:31.146
THEY'VE DONE.

03:06:31.213 --> 03:06:33.549
QUITE AN ADMIRABLE JOB OF

03:06:33.615 --> 03:06:35.617
PROCEEDING ON THAT BASIS. TO

03:06:35.684 --> 03:06:37.152
CONSTRUCT THIS --

03:06:37.219 --> 03:06:39.221
FROM THE GROUND UP --

03:06:39.288 --> 03:06:40.556
IN I THINK --

03:06:40.622 --> 03:06:43.425
AS ONE OF THE FOLKS THAT WAS

03:06:43.492 --> 03:06:45.160
ALWAYS PICKING AT THEM I THINK

03:06:45.227 --> 03:06:46.161
THEY'VE BEEN.

03:06:46.228 --> 03:06:48.230
RECEPTIVE --

03:06:48.297 --> 03:06:51.433
TO THE IDEAS AND CONCERNS --

03:06:51.500 --> 03:06:53.168
THAT ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE

03:06:53.235 --> 03:06:54.570
BEEN REGISTERING WITH THEM AS

03:06:54.636 --> 03:06:56.505
THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THIS AND

03:06:56.572 --> 03:06:59.608
WE'VE SEEN THE PROCESS IMPROVING --

03:06:59.675 --> 03:07:01.877
BEING MODIFIED --

03:07:01.944 --> 03:07:03.845
AND I BELIEVE [inaudible]

03:07:03.912 --> 03:07:07.449
PICKING UP DIFFICULT DEGREE OF

03:07:07.516 --> 03:07:09.117
MOMENTUM AND I DON'T THINKWE

03:07:09.184 --> 03:07:11.420
SHOULD LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT

03:07:11.486 --> 03:07:12.721
THAT -- THAT

03:07:12.788 --> 03:07:16.058
THIS REALLY IS A VERY VERY NOVEL

03:07:16.124 --> 03:07:17.893
UNDERTAKING AND I THINK --

03:07:17.960 --> 03:07:20.395
THE CHALLENGE OF DOING THAT IN A

03:07:20.462 --> 03:07:22.864
WAY THAT PRESERVES THE INTEGRITY

03:07:22.931 --> 03:07:25.434
OF THE END PRODUCT IS IS QUITE

03:07:25.500 --> 03:07:28.370
SIGNIFICANT IN A AND THAT'S BEEN

03:07:28.437 --> 03:07:30.772
A CONTRIBUTOR TO THIS.

03:07:30.839 --> 03:07:32.107
I MEAN PART PROBLEMS IT'S TO

03:07:32.174 --> 03:07:33.308
NOVEL WRITING AND IF IF IF MORE

03:07:33.375 --> 03:07:33.909
PEOPLE WERE DOING THIS AROUND

03:07:33.976 --> 03:07:35.877
THE WORLD WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO

03:07:35.944 --> 03:07:38.480
THE EXTRA WILL EMPOWER ITS THAN

03:07:38.547 --> 03:07:39.348
I WOULD.

03:07:39.414 --> 03:07:40.215
HEART OF IT TOO IS.

03:07:40.282 --> 03:07:42.784
THE STATUTE WAS EXTRAORDINARILY

03:07:42.851 --> 03:07:44.886
COMPREHENSIVE --

03:07:44.953 --> 03:07:49.091
AND THE IT THE THE DEGREE TO

03:07:49.157 --> 03:07:50.225
WHICH IT ITERATED SUCH A VERY

03:07:50.292 --> 03:07:51.693
VERY BROAD RANGE OF

03:07:51.760 --> 03:07:55.030
CONSIDERATIONS THAT HAD TO BE.

03:07:55.097 --> 03:07:57.566
DO HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED --

03:07:57.633 --> 03:07:58.934
I THINK --

03:07:59.001 --> 03:08:01.203
CARRIES A A GREAT DEAL OF WEIGHT

03:08:01.269 --> 03:08:03.305
IN TERMS OF FIGURING OUT JUST

03:08:03.372 --> 03:08:04.606
HOW YOU CAN DO THAT ON AN

03:08:04.673 --> 03:08:05.774
EXPEDITIOUS FOR THE MORE

03:08:05.841 --> 03:08:07.075
COMPREHENSIVE THAN WHAT THE

03:08:07.142 --> 03:08:08.677
EUROPEANS ARE DOING.

03:08:08.744 --> 03:08:11.446
YES I BELIEVE SO ADVOCATE ADDS

03:08:11.513 --> 03:08:12.014
TO THAT IS --

03:08:12.080 --> 03:08:12.881
I THINK THAT THERE'S ALSO A

03:08:12.948 --> 03:08:14.983
DIFFERENCE OF INTENT IN THE WAY

03:08:15.050 --> 03:08:19.187
THAT ALTERNATIVES ASSESSMENT ARE

03:08:19.254 --> 03:08:22.124
INCORPORATED INTO THIS.

03:08:22.190 --> 03:08:23.792
EFFORT WHERE --

03:08:23.859 --> 03:08:26.361
HISTORICALLY OR PREVIOUSLY ALTER

03:08:26.428 --> 03:08:28.330
IS THIS ASSESSMENT WAS OFTEN

03:08:28.397 --> 03:08:30.699
USED AS AN EXCUSE TO CAN THE

03:08:30.766 --> 03:08:32.467
LAST SEVERAL YEARS TRIED TO

03:08:32.534 --> 03:08:34.469
REHABILITATE THAT --

03:08:34.536 --> 03:08:35.771
TO MAKE IT.

03:08:35.837 --> 03:08:38.774
MUCH MORE FORWARD LOOKING SEVEN

03:08:38.840 --> 03:08:48.617
THAT IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF I

03:08:48.684 --> 03:08:49.751
CAN'T FIND ANYMORE ALTERNATIVE

03:08:49.818 --> 03:08:51.086
SO I HAVE TO KEEP USING THIS BAD

03:08:51.153 --> 03:08:51.620
THING -- TO

03:08:51.687 --> 03:08:52.454
A MORE EXPLORATORY CAN WE FIND

03:08:52.521 --> 03:08:53.622
SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY BETTER

03:08:53.689 --> 03:08:56.491
THAN WHAT'S A CHEMICAL OF

03:08:56.558 --> 03:08:57.092
CONCERN.

03:08:57.159 --> 03:08:59.061
AND YEAH.

03:08:59.127 --> 03:09:00.762
SEVERAL IF I MAY CLARIFY WHAT I

03:09:00.829 --> 03:09:01.697
WAS GETTING AT ITSELF NOT THE

03:09:01.763 --> 03:09:02.664
IDEA ISN'T TO REGULATE EVERY

03:09:02.731 --> 03:09:03.799
SINGLE STEP OF THE PROCESS FOR

03:09:03.865 --> 03:09:04.933
THE AGENTS SAY WE DON'T WANT TO

03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:07.202
DICTATE EVERY STEP IN THE RIGHT

03:09:07.269 --> 03:09:09.271
TAKE A TIME LINE DESIGN THINGS

03:09:09.337 --> 03:09:10.105
UP TO MAKE A SOME GENERAL

03:09:10.172 --> 03:09:10.639
PARAMETERS HERE.

03:09:10.706 --> 03:09:12.174
WITH THEM TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN

03:09:12.240 --> 03:09:13.875
TIME LINES WITHIN THOSE BROAD

03:09:13.942 --> 03:09:15.010
PARAMETERS SHE'S IT YOUR

03:09:15.077 --> 03:09:16.011
UNDERSTANDING YOUR THE THE

03:09:16.078 --> 03:09:17.446
ATTORNEY HERE IS IF YOU'RE

03:09:17.512 --> 03:09:18.013
SAYING THAT THE THAT THIS

03:09:18.080 --> 03:09:18.847
REALTORS SCHEME IS MORE

03:09:18.914 --> 03:09:19.781
COMPREHENSIVE THAN THE EUROPEANS.

03:09:19.848 --> 03:09:20.382
I THINK THEY'RE DIFFERENT IN

03:09:20.449 --> 03:09:20.816
NATURE AND THEY ARE

03:09:20.882 --> 03:09:21.750
COMPREHENSIVE IN DIFFERENT WAYS

03:09:21.817 --> 03:09:22.317
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A

03:09:22.384 --> 03:09:22.851
DIRECT COMPARISON THAT'S

03:09:22.918 --> 03:09:24.252
POSSIBLE BETWEEN THE TWO IN

03:09:24.319 --> 03:09:25.787
QUITE THOSE TERMS --

03:09:25.854 --> 03:09:31.893
BECAUSE THE THE THEY BEHAVE AND

03:09:31.960 --> 03:09:34.396
DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT WAYS.

03:09:34.463 --> 03:09:35.731
THINK YEAH THAT'S FAIR.

03:09:35.797 --> 03:09:37.232
OKAY LET ME ASK YOU A MISTER

03:09:37.299 --> 03:09:38.133
JACOB YOU KNOW THE ONE OF THE

03:09:38.200 --> 03:09:38.700
ISSUES IS FROM BROUGHT UP

03:09:38.767 --> 03:09:39.634
SEVERAL TIMES IS QUESTION ABOUT

03:09:39.701 --> 03:09:41.236
OF OF DATA AND AND AND GETTING

03:09:41.303 --> 03:09:42.904
DATA AND AND THE THE FRUSTRATION

03:09:42.971 --> 03:09:43.538
OF THE REGULATORS IS THAT THEY

03:09:43.605 --> 03:09:43.905
YEAH THEY KEEP.

03:09:43.972 --> 03:09:44.740
ASKING FOR THIS INFORMATION AND

03:09:44.806 --> 03:09:46.208
JUST PEOPLE ARE NOT FORTHCOMING

03:09:46.274 --> 03:09:48.410
WHY IS THAT WHAT'S YOUR

03:09:48.477 --> 03:09:53.181
UNDERSTANDING AS TO AS TO YEAH

03:09:53.248 --> 03:09:54.015
WELL LOCKED OR SLOW ROLLED AND I

03:09:54.082 --> 03:09:55.283
HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

03:09:55.350 --> 03:09:57.085
SIT DOWN --

03:09:57.152 --> 03:10:00.021
WITH THE STAFF AND DISCUSS THIS

03:10:00.088 --> 03:10:01.423
IN IN DETAIL.

03:10:01.490 --> 03:10:03.592
BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

03:10:03.658 --> 03:10:04.826
THAT -- THE

03:10:04.893 --> 03:10:07.162
ITS AT WORK HERE --

03:10:07.229 --> 03:10:09.598
IS THE WHOLE ISSUE OF SUPPLY

03:10:09.664 --> 03:10:11.066
CHAINS --

03:10:11.133 --> 03:10:13.568
AND THE COMPLEXITY OF

03:10:13.635 --> 03:10:17.172
CONTEMPORARY YEAH OPERATIONS --

03:10:17.239 --> 03:10:20.108
OFTEN INVOLVING GLOBAL --

03:10:20.175 --> 03:10:21.943
MOVEMENTS OF PRODUCTS OR

03:10:22.010 --> 03:10:23.879
CHEMICAL.

03:10:23.945 --> 03:10:26.748
AND WE DO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT WE

03:10:26.815 --> 03:10:28.784
HAVE A SYSTEM FOR TRYING TO

03:10:28.850 --> 03:10:30.652
ADDRESS IT THROUGH --

03:10:30.719 --> 03:10:33.288
THE ITS MISSION OF MATERIAL

03:10:33.355 --> 03:10:35.524
SAFETY DATA SHEETS THAT ARE

03:10:35.590 --> 03:10:37.592
SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT --

03:10:37.659 --> 03:10:40.362
SOME GUIDANCE ON HOW A GIVEN

03:10:40.428 --> 03:10:41.029
CHEMICAL IS SUPPOSED TO BE

03:10:41.096 --> 03:10:42.564
HANDLED --

03:10:42.631 --> 03:10:43.865
I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY ARE

03:10:43.932 --> 03:10:46.134
TOTALLY ADEQUATE TO THE KIND OF

03:10:46.201 --> 03:10:48.537
TASK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE --

03:10:48.603 --> 03:10:52.407
AND TO EXT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT

03:10:52.474 --> 03:10:54.109
THERE MAY BE DEFICIENCIES IN

03:10:54.176 --> 03:10:55.443
THAT PROCESS.

03:10:55.510 --> 03:10:56.945
THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING --

03:10:57.012 --> 03:10:58.547
TO SOME OF WHAT THEY'VE.

03:10:58.613 --> 03:11:02.717
FOUND MY EXPERIENCES WITH THE

03:11:02.784 --> 03:11:05.253
MAJOR CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS.

03:11:05.320 --> 03:11:08.723
AND MY PERSPECTIVE FROM THAT.

03:11:08.790 --> 03:11:11.393
IS THAT THEY RESPECT.

03:11:11.459 --> 03:11:14.930
DATA COLLINS THEY RESPECT --

03:11:14.996 --> 03:11:18.099
THAT THE AND NEEDS OF REGULATORS

03:11:18.166 --> 03:11:20.502
FOR DATA --

03:11:20.569 --> 03:11:23.138
AND COMPLY --

03:11:23.205 --> 03:11:24.439
AND NOW WHAT WE'RE NOT HEARING

03:11:24.506 --> 03:11:25.540
THAT FROM.

03:11:25.607 --> 03:11:27.209
THE DEPARTMENT BUT AS WELL AYE

03:11:27.275 --> 03:11:30.145
AYE UNDER AND THAT THEY'RE

03:11:30.212 --> 03:11:33.748
HAVING DIFFICULTIES GETTING DATA --

03:11:33.815 --> 03:11:37.586
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY FROM HOME --

03:11:37.652 --> 03:11:39.521
BUT WITH THE KINDS OF

03:11:39.588 --> 03:11:41.790
PROTECTIONS THAT CALIFORNIA FOR

03:11:41.857 --> 03:11:43.358
EXAMPLE --

03:11:43.425 --> 03:11:44.993
PROVIDES --

03:11:45.060 --> 03:11:48.463
WE ROUTINELY PROVIDE DATA THAT.

03:11:48.530 --> 03:11:50.031
THE COMPANIES ROUTINELY PROVIDE

03:11:50.098 --> 03:11:52.334
DATA -- TO

03:11:52.400 --> 03:11:53.535
THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE

03:11:53.602 --> 03:11:59.541
REGULATION. TO CARBON TO DTS SEE --

03:11:59.608 --> 03:12:04.512
AND IF IT'S A CASE OF OF

03:12:04.579 --> 03:12:06.214
COMPANIES THAT ARE NO BETTER

03:12:06.281 --> 03:12:08.884
THAN -- THEN

03:12:08.950 --> 03:12:09.851
WE ARE INTERESTED IN.

03:12:09.918 --> 03:12:16.157
CRAP -- I

03:12:16.224 --> 03:12:17.592
MISTER JACOB FINAL YEAR.

03:12:17.659 --> 03:12:19.160
YOU PUT FOR THE WEST THAT YOU

03:12:19.227 --> 03:12:21.096
DON'T THINK RIGHT NOW IT'S TIME

03:12:21.162 --> 03:12:22.731
FOR MORE LEGISLATION I THINK.

03:12:22.797 --> 03:12:25.734
HAVING READ THE THE REPORT THAT

03:12:25.800 --> 03:12:27.569
DOCTOR SOLOMON WROTE WE DO THINK

03:12:27.636 --> 03:12:28.637
IT IS TIME.

03:12:28.703 --> 03:12:30.105
BUT THERE WILL BE A LONG

03:12:30.171 --> 03:12:32.307
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND WE WILL

03:12:32.374 --> 03:12:36.645
CERTAINLY LISTEN TO THE INDUSTRY --

03:12:36.711 --> 03:12:37.746
WHAT DO I DO AND I THINK I WAS

03:12:37.812 --> 03:12:39.347
SAYING HE DOESN'T WANT%

03:12:39.414 --> 03:12:41.016
LEGISLATIVE ONE OFFS?

03:12:41.082 --> 03:12:42.217
THE HE HE HE WHAT HE WANTED THAT

03:12:42.284 --> 03:12:43.885
HE SUPPORTED THE SORT OF THE

03:12:43.952 --> 03:12:45.954
PROCESS OF THE DEPARTMENT MAKING

03:12:46.021 --> 03:12:47.088
DECISIONS.

03:12:47.155 --> 03:12:48.490
RATHER I'D RATHER THAN HAVING

03:12:48.556 --> 03:12:49.758
THE LEGISLATURE COME IN AND ASK

03:12:49.824 --> 03:12:50.992
FOR INDIVIDUAL CHEMICAL BANDS IS

03:12:51.059 --> 03:12:52.093
THAT RIGHT I THINK WHAT I THINK

03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:56.431
WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED WITH IS.

03:12:56.498 --> 03:12:56.631
THIS.

03:12:56.698 --> 03:12:58.800
YOU KNOW THIS [inaudible]

03:12:58.867 --> 03:13:03.138
AT DR WILSON'S REPORT ORIGINATED

03:13:03.204 --> 03:13:04.940
WITH THESE TWO COMMITTEES --

03:13:05.006 --> 03:13:06.207
AND A REQUEST --

03:13:06.274 --> 03:13:07.409
WHICH AS WE UNDERSTAND IT AND I

03:13:07.475 --> 03:13:10.011
WASN'T AROUND --

03:13:10.078 --> 03:13:11.846
AT THE TIME THAT REQUEST WHEN IN --

03:13:11.913 --> 03:13:12.681
WAS -- BORN

03:13:12.747 --> 03:13:16.851
AT LEAST IN PART SENSE OF A

03:13:16.918 --> 03:13:20.989
BARRAGE OF OF CHEMICAL BILL'S

03:13:21.056 --> 03:13:22.324
INDIVIDUAL BILLS YES.

03:13:22.390 --> 03:13:24.693
AND OF THE FACT THAT HAPHAZARD

03:13:24.759 --> 03:13:28.029
THAT GIVEN THE IMPERATIVES THAT

03:13:28.096 --> 03:13:29.764
YOU GUYS WORK UNDER --

03:13:29.831 --> 03:13:32.000
IT WAS A DIFFICULT IF NOT

03:13:32.067 --> 03:13:34.336
IMPOSSIBLE TO DO JUSTICE TO THEM

03:13:34.402 --> 03:13:35.570
IN THE SENSE.

03:13:35.637 --> 03:13:37.605
THAT WE WERE FINDING --

03:13:37.672 --> 03:13:39.607
OURSELVES.

03:13:39.674 --> 03:13:41.743
EXPECTED TO DELIVER A MORE

03:13:41.810 --> 03:13:43.445
COMPREHENSIVE PERSPECTIVE.

03:13:43.511 --> 03:13:44.312
ONLINE --

03:13:44.379 --> 03:13:45.780
CHEMICALS AND WHAT WE'RE TRADING

03:13:45.847 --> 03:13:49.150
OFF -- WE AS

03:13:49.217 --> 03:13:51.019
THE CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS --

03:13:51.086 --> 03:13:53.555
HAVE A STAKE OBVIOUSLY IN.

03:13:53.621 --> 03:13:55.056
IN MAKING SURE THAT WE

03:13:55.123 --> 03:13:56.791
UNDERSTAND THE TRADE OFFS THAT

03:13:56.858 --> 03:13:58.960
ARE OUT THERE --

03:13:59.027 --> 03:14:06.368
BUT I THINK THAT'S BEEN --

03:14:06.434 --> 03:14:08.269
TO WE DON'T WANT TO SEE

03:14:08.336 --> 03:14:08.570
[inaudible]

03:14:08.636 --> 03:14:10.905
ROUTE RECREATED.

03:14:10.972 --> 03:14:13.541
THAT WOULD END UP ATTRACTING

03:14:13.608 --> 03:14:17.445
FOLKS AS WAYS OF BYPASSING.

03:14:17.512 --> 03:14:20.215
THE INITIAL REVIEW PROCESSES OF

03:14:20.281 --> 03:14:22.283
THIS REGULATION --

03:14:22.350 --> 03:14:24.986
BUT IF.

03:14:25.053 --> 03:14:27.422
YOU KNOW WE WE ARE OPEN TO

03:14:27.489 --> 03:14:28.690
DISCUSSING.

03:14:28.757 --> 03:14:30.892
THE RANGE OF ISSUES THAT HAVE

03:14:30.959 --> 03:14:32.460
BEEN TALKED ABOUT HERE.

03:14:32.527 --> 03:14:35.130
AND IF THE CONCLUSION OF THOSE

03:14:35.196 --> 03:14:37.966
DISCUSSIONS IS THAT THE ONLY

03:14:38.033 --> 03:14:40.602
REMEDY FOR THIS IS IN FACT --

03:14:40.668 --> 03:14:43.938
STRATEGICALLY --

03:14:44.005 --> 03:14:46.941
PLACED LEGISLATION THEN.

03:14:47.008 --> 03:14:51.813
THAT THAT'S WHAT WILL BE.

03:14:51.880 --> 03:14:54.916
OUR SHOWS SENATOR ALLEN HAS A

03:14:54.983 --> 03:14:56.718
VERY IMPORTANT MEETING KEPT TO I

03:14:56.785 --> 03:15:00.388
WILL -- BE A

03:15:00.455 --> 03:15:01.222
HOT MONITORING THE REST OF THE

03:15:01.289 --> 03:15:04.659
DISCUSSION AND THEN THE PUBLIC

03:15:04.726 --> 03:15:06.294
COMMENT --

03:15:06.361 --> 03:15:08.596
SHOW S. AS I WAS GOING TO SAY TO

03:15:08.663 --> 03:15:10.498
YOU MISTER JACOB --

03:15:10.565 --> 03:15:12.367
WHEN WE DO BRING LEGISLATION

03:15:12.434 --> 03:15:14.569
FORWARD I WOULD JUST ASK YOU TO

03:15:14.636 --> 03:15:17.505
TAKE A LOOK AT THE DETAILS OF IT?

03:15:17.572 --> 03:15:20.275
AND YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK IT'S

03:15:20.341 --> 03:15:21.643
DUPLICATIVE.

03:15:21.709 --> 03:15:26.114
FINE BUT YOU KNOW TELL US WHERE

03:15:26.181 --> 03:15:27.916
GOING TOO FAR WE'RE NOT FAR

03:15:27.982 --> 03:15:30.552
ENOUGH AND JUST TALK TO US ABOUT

03:15:30.618 --> 03:15:32.554
THE DETAILS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING.

03:15:32.620 --> 03:15:34.589
OKAY THAT'S ALL WE ASK AND THAT

03:15:34.656 --> 03:15:36.324
THERE WILL BE LEGISLATION COMING

03:15:36.391 --> 03:15:37.826
FORWARD --

03:15:37.892 --> 03:15:39.160
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI THANK

03:15:39.227 --> 03:15:41.162
YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I I

03:15:41.229 --> 03:15:42.897
WANTED TO ASK A ESPECIALLY SOME

03:15:42.964 --> 03:15:51.339
OF THE THE ADVOCATES OF A OF

03:15:51.406 --> 03:15:54.309
ELIMINATING TOXIC CHEMICALS FIRM --

03:15:54.375 --> 03:15:58.980
FROM THE CONSUMER MARKET

03:15:59.047 --> 03:15:59.280
[inaudible]

03:15:59.347 --> 03:16:02.817
THE WHAT IF ANY SITUATIONS TO

03:16:02.884 --> 03:16:04.285
SEE WHERE YOU KNOW WE WE'VE

03:16:04.352 --> 03:16:05.220
HEARD TESTIMONY ABOUT HOW THE

03:16:05.286 --> 03:16:06.154
GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM IS

03:16:06.221 --> 03:16:07.889
SUPPOSED TO AVOID THESE.

03:16:07.956 --> 03:16:09.858
THESE ONE OFF TYPE APPROACHES

03:16:09.924 --> 03:16:11.726
THE THE WORKABLE APPROACHES AS

03:16:11.793 --> 03:16:13.228
THE DUTY --

03:16:13.294 --> 03:16:14.662
DTS SEE A DIRECTOR INDICATED BUT

03:16:14.729 --> 03:16:16.164
ARE THERE --

03:16:16.231 --> 03:16:17.599
CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SITUATIONS

03:16:17.665 --> 03:16:19.000
WHERE YOU THINK --

03:16:19.067 --> 03:16:20.135
YOU KNOW THEY WOULD BE JUSTIFIED

03:16:20.201 --> 03:16:22.003
THAT THE THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS

03:16:22.070 --> 03:16:23.505
JUST TOO SLOW AND THAT.

03:16:23.571 --> 03:16:24.472
TO AND THAT --

03:16:24.539 --> 03:16:26.774
GONNA WE NEED --

03:16:26.841 --> 03:16:29.310
TO YOU KNOW MAKE EXCEPTIONS

03:16:29.377 --> 03:16:33.081
GRAHAM. TO TO GOOD A ADDRESS

03:16:33.148 --> 03:16:36.351
SPECIFIC CHEMICALS --

03:16:36.417 --> 03:16:37.485
BUT LET ME MAKE SURE I

03:16:37.552 --> 03:16:38.453
UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION LATE BUT

03:16:38.520 --> 03:16:39.287
IF YOU'RE ASKING WHETHER THERE'S

03:16:39.354 --> 03:16:40.588
ROOM FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ACT

03:16:40.655 --> 03:16:42.590
WE DEFINITELY THINK SO --

03:16:42.657 --> 03:16:43.324
AN EXAMPLE IS THE FLAME

03:16:43.391 --> 03:16:45.226
RETARDANT BILL FROM LAST YEAR

03:16:45.293 --> 03:16:47.395
WHICH PROHIBITED THE USE OF

03:16:47.462 --> 03:16:48.730
FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS BROAD

03:16:48.796 --> 03:16:50.398
CLASSES OF THEM IN FURNITURE

03:16:50.465 --> 03:16:51.466
CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS AND MATTRESS

03:16:51.533 --> 03:16:51.900
PHONE.

03:16:51.966 --> 03:16:52.800
AND WITH THEIR THEIR EVIDENCE

03:16:52.867 --> 03:16:53.801
WAS PRETTY CLEAR THAT WERE NOT

03:16:53.868 --> 03:16:55.603
NEEDED IN THESE PRODUCTS AND WE

03:16:55.670 --> 03:16:56.204
THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR

03:16:56.271 --> 03:16:58.473
THE LEGISLATORS ACTED DID NOT

03:16:58.540 --> 03:17:00.241
NEED UP EXTENSIVE ALTERNATES

03:17:00.308 --> 03:17:00.775
ANALYSIS PROCESS IN THAT

03:17:00.842 --> 03:17:01.876
SCENARIO --

03:17:01.943 --> 03:17:03.678
BUT IT'S STILL CLASS APPROACH WE

03:17:03.745 --> 03:17:04.679
FULLY SUPPORT THAT CLASS

03:17:04.746 --> 03:17:09.484
APPROACH OKAY I HOPE THAT HELPS

03:17:09.551 --> 03:17:12.086
ANSWER THE QUIESCENT.

03:17:12.153 --> 03:17:13.521
BUT THEN I WOULD JUST ADD THAT

03:17:13.588 --> 03:17:14.122
WE ABSOLUTELY THINK THERE'S A

03:17:14.189 --> 03:17:15.623
ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND I

03:17:15.690 --> 03:17:17.292
AND I YOU KNOW IS AS IMPORTANT

03:17:17.358 --> 03:17:18.860
AS PROJECT THIS PROGRAM IS AND

03:17:18.927 --> 03:17:19.994
AS LONG AS IT'S SORT OF TAKEN TO

03:17:20.061 --> 03:17:21.029
GET UP TO SPEED.

03:17:21.095 --> 03:17:22.330
YEAH IN THE MEANTIME WE'RE BEING

03:17:22.397 --> 03:17:23.731
EXPOSED TO CHEMICALS THAT ARE

03:17:23.798 --> 03:17:25.667
JUST REALLY PROBLEMATIC AND

03:17:25.733 --> 03:17:26.534
REALLY --

03:17:26.601 --> 03:17:27.702
ARE HARMING PEOPLE AND SO.

03:17:27.769 --> 03:17:29.470
WE NEED THE LEGISLATURE TO ACT

03:17:29.537 --> 03:17:31.272
IN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE

03:17:31.339 --> 03:17:33.741
THE FLAME RETARDANT LEGISLATION

03:17:33.808 --> 03:17:36.110
YOU KNOW WE'VE BROUGHT A LOT OF

03:17:36.177 --> 03:17:37.212
FUN.

03:17:37.278 --> 03:17:38.179
DISCLOSURE BILLS TO THE

03:17:38.246 --> 03:17:39.948
LEGISLATURE TO WHICH HELPS NOT

03:17:40.014 --> 03:17:41.716
JUST THE PROGRAM BUT CONSUMERS

03:17:41.783 --> 03:17:42.784
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN THEIR

03:17:42.850 --> 03:17:43.818
PRODUCTS WE WORKED ON THE CLEAN

03:17:43.885 --> 03:17:45.019
PRODUCT.

03:17:45.086 --> 03:17:46.221
BILL TOGETHER WE WORKED ON A

03:17:46.287 --> 03:17:47.422
SALON PRODUCT BILL AS I

03:17:47.488 --> 03:17:48.923
MENTIONED WE HAVE SOME FRAGRANCE

03:17:48.990 --> 03:17:49.757
LEGISLATION COMING --

03:17:49.824 --> 03:17:53.995
BUT WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE IT

03:17:54.062 --> 03:17:56.030
IS THE LEGISLATURE SIMPLY TO SAY

03:17:56.097 --> 03:17:57.665
WE CAN'T TOUCH CHEMICAL

03:17:57.732 --> 03:17:59.767
REGULATION BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM

03:17:59.834 --> 03:18:01.135
EXISTS BECAUSE AS WE'VE HEARD.

03:18:01.202 --> 03:18:02.770
THERE'S NO WAY THIS PROGRAM CAN

03:18:02.837 --> 03:18:04.839
DEAL WITH THE FULL ARRAY OF

03:18:04.906 --> 03:18:06.841
ISSUES OUT THERE RIGHT THANK YOU

03:18:06.908 --> 03:18:07.809
CAN JUST ADD ONE QUICK POINT ON

03:18:07.875 --> 03:18:08.910
THAT VERY POINT WHICH IS THAT

03:18:08.977 --> 03:18:11.346
THERE ARE OVER.

03:18:11.412 --> 03:18:12.013
FORTY FIVE THOUSAND CHEMICALS AN

03:18:12.080 --> 03:18:13.615
ACTIVE USING COVERS AND EIGHTY

03:18:13.681 --> 03:18:14.616
THOUSAND THAT HAVE BEEN USING

03:18:14.682 --> 03:18:16.217
COVERS AT SOME POINT IN TIME.

03:18:16.284 --> 03:18:18.186
YOU KNOW EVEN IF THE PROGRAM

03:18:18.253 --> 03:18:19.721
WERE -- TO

03:18:19.787 --> 03:18:22.357
YOU KNOW WORK AT FALL BREAK

03:18:22.423 --> 03:18:23.324
ADDRESS ALL THOSE HANDS A

03:18:23.391 --> 03:18:26.060
CHEMICAL SO THERE'S CLEARLY ROOM

03:18:26.127 --> 03:18:29.097
FOR ACTION FROM BOTH PARTIES.

03:18:29.163 --> 03:18:30.365
THANK YOU VERY MUCH CURRENT

ALL RIGHT --

03:18:33.568 --> 03:18:35.703
I THINK IT THEN IT IS TIME TO

03:18:35.770 --> 03:18:37.105
MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT AND I

03:18:37.171 --> 03:18:38.773
WANT TO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH

I LEARNED QUITE A BIT TODAY

03:18:42.343 --> 03:18:43.745
THANK YOU AND THIS WILL

03:18:43.811 --> 03:18:45.480
DEFINITELY HAVE IMPACT ON THE

03:18:45.546 --> 03:18:46.581
LEGISLATION THAT'S BROUGHT

03:18:46.648 --> 03:18:50.785
FORWARD.

03:18:50.852 --> 03:18:52.186
ALL RIGHT HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD

03:18:52.253 --> 03:18:56.324

FOR OVER A TWENTY YEAR PERIOD

03:21:03.751 --> 03:21:04.619
ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN ABLE WITH

03:21:04.685 --> 03:21:06.421
TEXAS POLICY AND WE HAVE

03:21:06.487 --> 03:21:07.855
DELIVERED A CONSISTENT MESSAGE

03:21:07.922 --> 03:21:09.190
THAT WITH MOST MOVE --

03:21:09.257 --> 03:21:11.726
UPSTREAM AND WE MUST FOCUS ON

03:21:11.793 --> 03:21:12.960
AND DEEPEN OUR COMMITMENT TO

THE CENTER OF TAXIS POLICY --

03:21:16.431 --> 03:21:17.532
FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE GREEK

03:21:17.598 --> 03:21:18.800
YOU MISTER PROGRAM --

03:21:18.866 --> 03:21:20.134
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVOCATES

03:21:20.201 --> 03:21:21.269
WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROGRAM

03:21:21.335 --> 03:21:23.304
NOT MOVING FAST AND FOURTEEN OF

03:21:23.371 --> 03:21:24.272
AB STRING.

03:21:24.338 --> 03:21:25.540
BECAUSE A GREEK MISTER PROGRAM

03:21:25.606 --> 03:21:27.341
WAS BE SEEN FROM A CONTEXT OF AN

03:21:27.408 --> 03:21:29.177
AGENCY THAT IS FAILING TO MEET

03:21:29.243 --> 03:21:31.412
ITS MISSION ON ALL THREE COUNTS.

03:21:31.479 --> 03:21:33.314
AS A FORMER DTC DIRECTOR ONCE

03:21:33.381 --> 03:21:36.017
SAID THE JOB OF THE T. C. IS.

03:21:36.083 --> 03:21:37.285
TO LOOK AT THE PAT THE SINS OF

03:21:37.351 --> 03:21:38.719
THE PAST ADDRESS CURRENCIES AND

03:21:38.786 --> 03:21:40.288
PREVENT DISEASE OF THE FUTURE.

03:21:40.354 --> 03:21:44.058
THE DISEASE OF DEALING WITH THE

03:21:44.125 --> 03:21:46.961
LEGACY OF WATER IN AIR AND AND

03:21:47.028 --> 03:21:48.129
WE AGREE THAT THE PACE OF

03:21:48.196 --> 03:21:49.197
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SECOND WAS

03:21:49.263 --> 03:21:50.698
FACE OF A CONSUMER PRODUCTS IS

03:21:50.765 --> 03:21:51.499
BEING TO SLOW.

03:21:51.566 --> 03:21:52.533
THE CALIFORNIA'S OVERALLS

03:21:52.600 --> 03:21:54.702

DEVELOPMENT TO FIELD INNOVATION

03:21:57.038 --> 03:21:59.040
GAP HAS NOT BEEN ENOUGH --

03:21:59.106 --> 03:22:00.274
THE GREEK CAM SUBURBAN COULD

03:22:00.341 --> 03:22:01.676
PROVIDE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO

03:22:01.742 --> 03:22:02.844
SHIFT TOWARDS A CRADLE TO CRADLE

03:22:02.910 --> 03:22:04.912

03:22:04.979 --> 03:22:06.380
OUR LARGEST EFFORTS.

03:22:06.447 --> 03:22:08.516
TO DETECT THE CART DETOXIFY TO

CARBONIZED IN THE MARKET AS OUR

03:22:09.217 --> 03:22:10.618
ECONOMY BUT THAT WILL ONLY

03:22:10.685 --> 03:22:12.186
HAPPEN WITH A STRONG COMMITMENT

03:22:12.253 --> 03:22:14.288
WITH THE STRONG LEADERSHIP AND

03:22:14.355 --> 03:22:15.089
WITH COMPLETE COMMUNITY

03:22:15.156 --> 03:22:18.726

03:22:18.793 --> 03:22:20.728
AGENCY ACCOUNTABILITY.

03:22:20.795 --> 03:22:21.863
THE GREEK MISTER PROGRAM LACKS A

03:22:21.929 --> 03:22:22.730
COHERENT --

PROGRAMS LIKE POLLUTION

03:22:26.634 --> 03:22:27.468
PREVENTION AND PERMITTING.

03:22:27.535 --> 03:22:28.402
ADDITIONALLY FUNDING FOR THIS

03:22:28.469 --> 03:22:29.504
PROGRAM SHOULD NOT COME AT THE

03:22:29.570 --> 03:22:31.305
EXPENSE OF OTHER PROGRAMS WHICH

03:22:31.372 --> 03:22:32.874
IS SPEAKS TO THE NEED TO FIX THE

THAT EXPERIENCE TO HELP ME

03:23:20.187 --> 03:23:22.023
UNDERSTAND THAT GREEN CHEMISTRY

03:23:22.089 --> 03:23:24.091
AND CLEAN ENERGY ARE TWO SIDES

03:23:24.158 --> 03:23:26.394

CAMPAIGN THAT DOCTOR MULVIHILL.

03:26:13.961 --> 03:26:15.529
MENTIONED EARLIER IN HIS

TESTIMONY.

03:26:16.464 --> 03:26:18.365
ARM I'M JUST GOING TO FOCUS ON

03:26:18.432 --> 03:26:19.800
ONE THING THAT WE HAVE BEEN AS

03:26:19.867 --> 03:26:21.802
AN ORGANIZATION INVOLVED AS WELL

03:26:21.869 --> 03:26:23.304
AS OTHERS SINCE THE VERY

03:26:23.370 --> 03:26:25.306
INCEPTION OF THIS PROGRAM FROM

03:26:25.372 --> 03:26:26.874
THE PASSAGE OF THE ORIGINAL LAW

03:26:26.941 --> 03:26:28.409
THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS

03:26:28.476 --> 03:26:29.844
AND BEYOND.

03:26:29.910 --> 03:26:31.412
AND WE DO BELIEVE --

03:26:31.479 --> 03:26:33.247
THAT IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE

03:26:33.314 --> 03:26:34.815
REALIZED A LONG TIME AGO THAT

03:26:34.882 --> 03:26:36.050
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO TREAT

03:26:36.117 --> 03:26:37.384
OUR WAY OUT OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL

03:26:37.451 --> 03:26:39.854
PROBLEMS OR ARE HEALTH PROBLEMS.

03:26:39.920 --> 03:26:41.455
AND WE NEED TO START GETTING TO

03:26:41.522 --> 03:26:43.124
THE SOURCES AND WE THINK THAT

03:26:43.190 --> 03:26:45.326
THIS PROGRAM IS THE INNOVATIVE

03:26:45.392 --> 03:26:46.694
PROGRAM THE FRANKLY THE WHOLE

03:26:46.761 --> 03:26:48.295
WORLD IS WATCHING TO SEE MOVE

03:26:48.362 --> 03:26:49.096
FORWARD.

03:26:49.163 --> 03:26:50.798
SO WE WANT TO SUPPORT THAT WE

03:26:50.865 --> 03:26:52.733
THINK THE STAFF HAS STRUGGLED

03:26:52.800 --> 03:26:54.568
THROUGH A LOT OF DIFFICULTY.

03:26:54.635 --> 03:26:56.303
GROUND BREAKING EFFORTS AND HAVE

03:26:56.370 --> 03:26:58.005
DONE VERY WELL BUT IT NEEDS TO

03:26:58.072 --> 03:26:58.873
DO BETTER.

03:26:58.939 --> 03:27:00.841
AND I JUST WANT TO FOCUS MY

03:27:00.908 --> 03:27:04.912
COMMENTS A FAST TRACK OR THE

03:27:04.979 --> 03:27:07.948
LEGISLATORS LEGISLATURE'S ROLE.

03:27:08.015 --> 03:27:09.483
OUR FRUSTRATION HAS BEEN THAT

03:27:09.550 --> 03:27:10.818
WHILE THIS SHOULD BE A

03:27:10.885 --> 03:27:12.286
DELIBERATE PROCESS AS WE LOOK AT

03:27:12.353 --> 03:27:14.288
SCIENCE AND AVOID REGRETTABLE

03:27:14.355 --> 03:27:16.257
SUBSTITUTION IS AS YOU'VE HEARD

03:27:16.323 --> 03:27:17.992
THERE ARE CASES WHERE IT'S VERY

03:27:18.058 --> 03:27:19.293
CLEAR.

03:27:19.360 --> 03:27:20.327
THAT PROGRAM --

03:27:20.394 --> 03:27:21.929
THE PRODUCTS DON'T NEED CERTAIN

03:27:21.996 --> 03:27:23.564
KINDS OF CHEMICALS IN THEM OR

03:27:23.631 --> 03:27:24.865
THAT THERE ARE.

03:27:24.932 --> 03:27:26.801
WELL VETTED SAFER ALTERNATIVES

03:27:26.867 --> 03:27:27.668
OUT THERE THAT HAVE BEEN

03:27:27.735 --> 03:27:29.503
ANALYZED AND WE DO THINK THERE

03:27:29.570 --> 03:27:30.805
NEEDS TO BE A STRUCTURE FOR

03:27:30.871 --> 03:27:32.173
EITHER THE LEGISLATOR

03:27:32.239 --> 03:27:34.809
LEGISLATURE TO ACT OR FOR

03:27:34.875 --> 03:27:36.944
DETAILS SEAT TO LOOK AT THE DATA

03:27:37.011 --> 03:27:38.345
THAT'S BEEN OUT THERE AND TO

03:27:38.412 --> 03:27:40.281
MAKE A REGULATORY DECISION.

03:27:40.347 --> 03:27:42.650
AS LONG AS THAT HAS BEEN VETTED

03:27:42.716 --> 03:27:43.951
SO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO MOVE AWAY

03:27:44.018 --> 03:27:44.985
FROM SCIENCE WE'RE TRYING TO

03:27:45.052 --> 03:27:46.954
MOVE TOWARD EFFICIENCY SO WE CAN

03:27:47.021 --> 03:27:49.089
PUT THE RESOURCES WHERE THINGS

03:27:49.156 --> 03:27:50.424
AREN'T QUITE AS CLEAR.

03:27:50.491 --> 03:27:55.196

GOOD LATE AFTERNOON I'M BILL

03:37:07.147 --> 03:37:07.848
ALLEY --

03:37:07.914 --> 03:37:08.648
WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING

03:37:08.715 --> 03:37:10.016
GROUP -- WE

03:37:10.083 --> 03:37:11.351
SUPPORT THE PROGRAM WE THINK THE

03:37:11.418 --> 03:37:12.686
STAFF IS DOING EVERYTHING THEY

03:37:12.753 --> 03:37:13.687
CAN DO -- TO

03:37:13.754 --> 03:37:15.455
GET THIS STUFF DONE AND AND

03:37:15.522 --> 03:37:16.757
PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH AND THE

03:37:16.823 --> 03:37:17.891
ENVIRONMENT --

03:37:17.958 --> 03:37:19.459
BUT IF THE PROGRAM'S WORKING THE

03:37:19.526 --> 03:37:20.961
WAY IT WAS DESIGNED TO DO I

03:37:21.027 --> 03:37:23.397
THINK WE NEED PROGRAM CHANGES I

03:37:23.463 --> 03:37:24.765
KNOW THINGS AFTER YOU DELIVER IT

03:37:24.831 --> 03:37:26.433
DELIBERATE COULD SCIENCE AT

03:37:26.500 --> 03:37:28.869
CETERA BUT IF WE DON'T GO FASTER

03:37:28.935 --> 03:37:31.104
THINGS WILL TAKE TEN TWENTY

03:37:31.171 --> 03:37:32.806
YEARS BEFORE WE GET.

03:37:32.873 --> 03:37:34.274
SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS SO --

03:37:34.341 --> 03:37:36.042
THAT'S OUR BIG CONCERN ON THE

03:37:36.109 --> 03:37:37.978
ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE IN

03:37:38.044 --> 03:37:39.246
TWENTY ELEVEN WHEN THE BPA IN

03:37:39.312 --> 03:37:41.214
BABY BOTTLE BILL CAME THROUGH --

03:37:41.281 --> 03:37:43.116
THE DIRECTOR DTS AT THAT TIME

03:37:43.183 --> 03:37:44.584
WROTE A LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE

03:37:44.651 --> 03:37:46.787
WAS TO THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY

03:37:46.853 --> 03:37:48.388
SAYING WE SUPPORT THE BILL NOT.

03:37:48.455 --> 03:37:49.356
NEUTRAL BUT WE SUPPORT THE BILL

03:37:49.423 --> 03:37:51.158
THEY SAID BECAUSE IF YOU THE

03:37:51.224 --> 03:37:52.492
LEGISLATURE FEELS LIKE SOME

03:37:52.559 --> 03:37:54.561
PORTENT TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH

03:37:54.628 --> 03:37:56.696
MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY THEN WE CAN

03:37:56.763 --> 03:37:58.698
GET TO GO FOR IT. NINE NO THEY

03:37:58.765 --> 03:38:00.133
WEREN'T REGULATIONS THEN YEAH

03:38:00.200 --> 03:38:01.735
AND THINGS WERE LAID OUT AS WELL

03:38:01.802 --> 03:38:03.203
THEY ARE NOW BUT I THINK THE

03:38:03.270 --> 03:38:04.604
MESSAGE THEY'RE STILL HOLDS.

03:38:04.671 --> 03:38:06.106
AND I THINK WHEN THE QUESTIONS

03:38:06.173 --> 03:38:07.808
WHEN YOU HAVE CLEAR EVIDENCE TO

03:38:07.874 --> 03:38:09.976
ACT IN THE LESSER TO SAY IS

03:38:10.043 --> 03:38:11.077
DROOLING SCIENCE WHAT WE DID

03:38:11.144 --> 03:38:12.679
WITH BPA WE HAD.

03:38:12.746 --> 03:38:14.181
AT THAT TIME TWO HUNDRED TWENTY

03:38:14.247 --> 03:38:16.917
FIVE ABSTRACTS TO THAT SHOWED

03:38:16.983 --> 03:38:19.853
HARM AND THE INDUSTRY AT TWENTY

03:38:19.920 --> 03:38:20.954
FIVE SHOWING NO HARM THEY WERE

03:38:21.021 --> 03:38:22.656
ALL INDUSTRY FUNDED SO WE FELT

03:38:22.722 --> 03:38:24.558
WE HAD AN OVERWHELMINGLY CLEAR

03:38:24.624 --> 03:38:27.060
CASE YOU MAY NOT GET A IN EVERY.

03:38:27.127 --> 03:38:28.929
A CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE THAT BUT WE

03:38:28.995 --> 03:38:29.796
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD WAIT TILL

03:38:29.863 --> 03:38:31.598
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR

03:38:31.665 --> 03:38:32.966
EVIDENCE OR WE COULD WAIT

03:38:33.033 --> 03:38:34.034
FOREVER.

03:38:34.100 --> 03:38:36.269
AS WE KNOW SMOKING TOBACCO WENT

03:38:36.336 --> 03:38:38.104
ON FOR SOME THIRTY YEARS AND

03:38:38.171 --> 03:38:38.939
EVEN TODAY SOMEONE ARGUED

03:38:39.005 --> 03:38:40.974
DOESN'T CAUSE CANCER SUS A

03:38:41.041 --> 03:38:42.876
STRONG CORE CORRELATION SO YOU

03:38:42.943 --> 03:38:44.544
WON'T GET THAT ARGUMENT HERE

03:38:44.611 --> 03:38:45.645
YEAH I KNOW THAT.

03:38:45.712 --> 03:38:47.214
BUT IN TERMS OF GETTING CLEAR

03:38:47.280 --> 03:38:48.482
BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE CAN ACT I

03:38:48.548 --> 03:38:49.883
KNOW PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE

03:38:49.950 --> 03:38:51.418
SINGLE CHEMICAL BAND BILLS

03:38:51.485 --> 03:38:53.153
YOU'LL VOTE ON A BILL.

03:38:53.220 --> 03:38:54.688
TO AFFECT THE TAKE OF DUNGEON IS

03:38:54.754 --> 03:38:56.323
CRAB ONE DAY YOU'RE NOT MARINE

03:38:56.389 --> 03:38:58.058
BIOLOGIST YET YOU'RE GETTING

03:38:58.124 --> 03:38:59.326
INFORMATION FROM FISH AND

03:38:59.392 --> 03:39:00.560
WILDLIFE BIOLOGISTS USING THEY

03:39:00.627 --> 03:39:01.795
MUST BE RIGHT.

03:39:01.862 --> 03:39:03.196
BUT WE CAN PRESENT YOU TO

03:39:03.263 --> 03:39:05.165
INFORMATION THAT SOME CHEMICALS

03:39:05.232 --> 03:39:06.566
ARE REALLY BAD FOR YOU AND MOST

03:39:06.633 --> 03:39:08.401
SCIENTISTS WHO AREN'T BEING PAID

03:39:08.468 --> 03:39:10.003
BY THE INDUSTRY TO SAY SO WILL

03:39:10.070 --> 03:39:10.670
AGREE.

03:39:10.737 --> 03:39:11.738
SO WE THINK THERE WILL BE A ROLE

03:39:11.805 --> 03:39:12.606
WE'RE NOT SAYING WE'RE GONNA

03:39:12.672 --> 03:39:14.174
OPEN THE FLOODGATES ON SINGLE

03:39:14.241 --> 03:39:15.475
CHEMICAL BAND BILLS THIS ONE

03:39:15.542 --> 03:39:18.845
ONLY THAT OPENING THEIR THANK

03:39:18.912 --> 03:39:19.012
YOU.

03:39:19.079 --> 03:39:21.381
THANK YOU.

03:39:21.448 --> 03:39:22.782
HI A GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS

03:39:22.849 --> 03:39:23.917
THE END OFASK IS SOME POLICY

03:39:23.984 --> 03:39:24.784
MANAGER FOR THE CALIFORNIA FROM

03:39:24.851 --> 03:39:26.520
TO SCIENCE AND I'M HERE. TO

03:39:26.586 --> 03:39:27.888
REALLY ACOSTA MY COMMENTS EVER

03:39:27.954 --> 03:39:29.322
MADE BY WHENEVER MEMBER ANY

03:39:29.389 --> 03:39:29.890
PATIENTS --

03:39:29.956 --> 03:39:30.624
PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL

03:39:30.690 --> 03:39:32.359
RESPONSIBILITY THE LA CHAPTER IN

03:39:32.425 --> 03:39:33.193
THE SPECIFICALLY JUST

03:39:33.260 --> 03:39:35.195
EMPHASIZING THAT LOOKING AT THIS

03:39:35.262 --> 03:39:36.496
PROGRAM IS REALLY CRITICAL.

03:39:36.563 --> 03:39:38.231
ON BUT ALSO HAVING OF

03:39:38.298 --> 03:39:39.599
UNDERSTANDING BOTH FOR THE SAME

03:39:39.666 --> 03:39:40.901
CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM IN THE

03:39:40.967 --> 03:39:41.868
GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM LOOKING

03:39:41.935 --> 03:39:44.070
AT THROUGH MORE HOW WE CAN

03:39:44.137 --> 03:39:45.238
ACTUALLY INVENTS A MOMENT SUCH

03:39:45.305 --> 03:39:45.972
AS THE POLICIES IN THOSE

03:39:46.039 --> 03:39:47.541
PROGRAMS WERE LOOKING AT THE PRE

03:39:47.607 --> 03:39:48.675
SHUFFLING.

03:39:48.742 --> 03:39:49.910
BUT ALSO BE MINDFUL THERE'S A

03:39:49.976 --> 03:39:51.177
LARGER CONVERSATION HAPPENING

03:39:51.244 --> 03:39:52.979
ABOUT HE'S HE'S TTC OVERALL IN

03:39:53.046 --> 03:39:54.314
THE REFORM THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN

03:39:54.381 --> 03:39:56.149
TO REALLY LOOKING AT HOW THIS

03:39:56.216 --> 03:39:57.417
PROGRAM CAN ACTUALLY FIT IN THAT

03:39:57.484 --> 03:39:58.718
CONVERSATION UP WHEN WE ACTUALLY

03:39:58.785 --> 03:40:02.656
LOOK AT HOW DO WE LOOK AT THE

03:40:02.722 --> 03:40:03.189
ENTIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE

03:40:03.256 --> 03:40:04.791
DIFFERENT.

03:40:04.858 --> 03:40:05.959
THIS COMMITTEE I KNOW WITH THE

03:40:06.026 --> 03:40:07.561
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ON

03:40:07.627 --> 03:40:08.595
REALLY CLOSE IN THE NEXT COUPLE

03:40:08.662 --> 03:40:11.631
MONTHS THANK YOU.

03:40:11.698 --> 03:40:13.600
SO I I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE

03:40:13.667 --> 03:40:15.402
WHO TESTIFIED AND ALSO ALL THE

03:40:15.468 --> 03:40:16.536
PEOPLE WHO GAVE ME THEIR PUBLIC

03:40:16.603 --> 03:40:19.539
COMMENTS --

03:40:19.606 --> 03:40:21.274
THE I'M SURE THERE WILL BE BILLS

03:40:21.341 --> 03:40:25.679
LIES THERE WAS LAST YEAR ON THE

03:40:25.745 --> 03:40:27.914
BANNING OF THE FLAME RETARDANT

03:40:27.981 --> 03:40:29.282
MATERIALS ON THE GROUNDS THAT

03:40:29.349 --> 03:40:30.850
THEY WEREN'T NEEDED WHEN YOU GET

03:40:30.917 --> 03:40:32.252
THAT KIND OF ADVICE FROM THE

03:40:32.319 --> 03:40:35.388
FIREFIGHTERS IT'S HARD TO IGNORE.

03:40:35.455 --> 03:40:37.090
ON THE OTHER HAND I ALSO HEARD

03:40:37.157 --> 03:40:39.092
FROM PEOPLE IN THE TESTIMONY

03:40:39.159 --> 03:40:40.660
HERE INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:40:40.727 --> 03:40:42.195
ADVOCATES ARE.

03:40:42.262 --> 03:40:44.397
CONCERNED ABOUT BREAST CANCER.

03:40:44.464 --> 03:40:46.633
THAT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM IF YOU

03:40:46.700 --> 03:40:49.135
BAND B. P. A AND THEN THERE'S A

03:40:49.202 --> 03:40:51.571
SUBSTITUTION OF B. PS I'M NOT

03:40:51.638 --> 03:40:53.173
EVEN SURE WHAT THAT IS BUT THEY

03:40:53.239 --> 03:40:54.975
SAID IT'S JUST AS DANGEROUS SO I

03:40:55.041 --> 03:40:56.343
THINK.

03:40:56.409 --> 03:40:58.011
YOU KNOW IT'S ONE THING TO SAY

03:40:58.078 --> 03:41:00.914
WE DON'T WANT ANY CHEMICAL.

03:41:00.981 --> 03:41:02.916
THAT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD.

03:41:02.983 --> 03:41:05.018
BUT YOU KNOW WHEN IT WHEN WE'RE

03:41:05.085 --> 03:41:06.519
TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING WHERE

03:41:06.586 --> 03:41:08.555
WERE BANNING ONE CHEMICAL AND WE

03:41:08.622 --> 03:41:10.757
MIGHT GET SOMETHING JUST AS BAD

03:41:10.824 --> 03:41:11.825
I THINK WE HAVE TO BE VERY

03:41:11.891 --> 03:41:12.792
CAREFUL.

03:41:12.859 --> 03:41:14.661
AND THAT'S A MAJOR REASON WHY WE

03:41:14.728 --> 03:41:16.262
NEED GREEN CHEMISTRY AND WHY WE

03:41:16.329 --> 03:41:17.931
REALLY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN

03:41:17.998 --> 03:41:20.900
WE LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL BILLS.

03:41:20.967 --> 03:41:27.540
THAT WE ARE VERY CAREFUL --

03:41:27.607 --> 03:41:28.608
SHE CHIU --

03:41:28.675 --> 03:41:31.544
I WOULD SAY REFERRED THEM WHICH

03:41:31.611 --> 03:41:32.779
ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY WE

03:41:32.846 --> 03:41:34.214
HAD DE HERE TODAY.

03:41:34.280 --> 03:41:35.281
THAT WE REFERRED THEM TO THE

03:41:35.348 --> 03:41:37.017
GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM TO

03:41:37.083 --> 03:41:39.586
REALLY LOOK AT THE ALTERNATIVES --

03:41:39.653 --> 03:41:41.254
PARTICULARLY FOR REALLY SURE

03:41:41.321 --> 03:41:43.323
THAT'S A CHEMICAL THAT SHOULDN'T

03:41:43.390 --> 03:41:44.691
BE SOMEWHERE.

03:41:44.758 --> 03:41:45.759
THAT WOULD PUT IT TO THE HEAD OF

03:41:45.825 --> 03:41:48.762
THE LINE FOR THE DEVS AND I

03:41:48.828 --> 03:41:50.263
THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT.

03:41:50.330 --> 03:41:52.365
IN MANY CASES IT WILL BE

03:41:52.432 --> 03:41:53.600
IMPORTANT TO DO --

03:41:53.667 --> 03:41:55.969
DIFFICULT CASES WHERE THERE'S

03:41:56.036 --> 03:41:58.605
SCIENTIFIC UNCERTAINTY --

03:41:58.672 --> 03:42:00.807
HOW DO WE INTEGRATE THAT INTO

03:42:00.874 --> 03:42:03.443
THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM

03:42:03.510 --> 03:42:04.811
RATHER THAN MAKING IT A?

03:42:04.878 --> 03:42:07.213
PRIORITY CHEMICAL HOW DO WE ASK

03:42:07.280 --> 03:42:08.081
THEM.

03:42:08.148 --> 03:42:09.382
SHOULD THIS BE A PRIORITY

03:42:09.449 --> 03:42:11.818
CHEMICAL I'M NOT QUITE SURE YET

03:42:11.885 --> 03:42:13.887
AND WE DON'T HAVE THE WE DO HAVE

03:42:13.953 --> 03:42:14.954
SOMEONE PERHAPS.

03:42:15.021 --> 03:42:16.656
COULD YOU COME UP.

03:42:16.723 --> 03:42:18.825
OF SIR I KNOW YOU'RE IN CHARGE

03:42:18.892 --> 03:42:20.860
OF THIS PROGRAM.

03:42:20.927 --> 03:42:23.463
IF THE LEGISLATURE IS CONCERNED

03:42:23.530 --> 03:42:26.132
THAT A CHEMICAL COULD BE HARMFUL.

03:42:26.199 --> 03:42:29.636
BUT THEY'RE NOT READY YET TO SAY

03:42:29.703 --> 03:42:31.905
FOR SURE IT IS IS THERE AWAY

03:42:31.971 --> 03:42:33.707
YOUR PROGRAM CAN ADDRESS IT.

03:42:33.773 --> 03:42:35.642
AND HOW WOULD WE CRAFT THAT

03:42:35.709 --> 03:42:39.813
LEGISLATION. FOR THE FIRST AM I

03:42:39.879 --> 03:42:41.114
JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT OUR

03:42:41.181 --> 03:42:43.083
PROCESS OF SELECTING PRODUCTS

03:42:43.149 --> 03:42:44.884
AND EVALUATING.

03:42:44.951 --> 03:42:46.352
WHAT WE PUT IN OUR WORK PLAN AND

03:42:46.419 --> 03:42:48.088
VALUING SPECIFIC CHEMICALS IS A

03:42:48.154 --> 03:42:49.322
VERY OPEN AND TRANSPARENT

03:42:49.389 --> 03:42:51.257
PROCESS IS SO EVERYONE'S WELCOME

03:42:51.324 --> 03:42:52.459
TO PARTICIPATE THAT WHETHER

03:42:52.525 --> 03:42:53.093
YOU'RE?

03:42:53.159 --> 03:42:54.527
CARRYING A BILL YOUR WORK

03:42:54.594 --> 03:42:56.529
REPRESENT ADVOCACY GROUP FOR AN

03:42:56.596 --> 03:42:57.731
INDUSTRY REPRESENTED BECAUSE

03:42:57.797 --> 03:42:59.132
SOMEONE ALLUDED TO WE SAY

03:42:59.199 --> 03:43:00.400
INFORMATIONS ACQUIRE THE REAL

03:43:00.467 --> 03:43:02.302
REALLY FOCUS ON GETTING GOOD

03:43:02.368 --> 03:43:04.938
INFORMATION --

03:43:05.004 --> 03:43:07.907
AND SO IF YOU HAVE A INFORMALLY

03:43:07.974 --> 03:43:09.175
FORMALLY IF YOU PASS A BILL YOU

03:43:09.242 --> 03:43:11.144
COULDN'T.

03:43:11.211 --> 03:43:12.612
YOU KNOW YOU CAN FORCE US TO

03:43:12.679 --> 03:43:13.913
LOOK AT SOMETHING AND AND OUR

03:43:13.980 --> 03:43:15.448
PROCESS E CAN GIVE JUST GIVE US

03:43:15.515 --> 03:43:17.383
A PETITION SO THERE'S A VARIETY

03:43:17.450 --> 03:43:18.818
OF WAYS THAT YOU CAN.

03:43:18.885 --> 03:43:21.554
WRITE YOUR CONCERNS KNOWN --

03:43:21.621 --> 03:43:23.056
IN THE OKAY SO IF WE WERE TO

03:43:23.123 --> 03:43:24.657
PASS A BILL BY.

03:43:24.724 --> 03:43:25.725
AND WE WEREN'T SURE IT WAS A

03:43:25.792 --> 03:43:27.327
PROBLEM IF IT'S A PROBLEM WE

03:43:27.393 --> 03:43:28.561
SHOULD IF WE'RE SURE IT'S A

03:43:28.628 --> 03:43:29.729
PROBLEM WE CAN MAKE IT A

03:43:29.796 --> 03:43:31.264
PRIORITY PRODUCT.

03:43:31.331 --> 03:43:33.166
INSTANTLY AND THEN YOU'RE GOING

03:43:33.233 --> 03:43:34.768
TO BE LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVES IF

03:43:34.834 --> 03:43:36.503
WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT DO WE SAY IN

03:43:36.569 --> 03:43:38.004
THE BILL.

03:43:38.071 --> 03:43:40.940
WHAT DO WE ASK YOU TO DO?

03:43:41.007 --> 03:43:42.175
WELL I THINK IT MANY TIMES A

03:43:42.242 --> 03:43:43.143
LEGISLATURE ASKED US TO

03:43:43.209 --> 03:43:44.878
INVESTIGATE.

03:43:44.944 --> 03:43:46.479
OR DO A STUDY ON SOMETHING AND

03:43:46.546 --> 03:43:48.181
WE COULD DO THAT AND THERE'S

03:43:48.248 --> 03:43:49.282
DIFFERENT ENTRY POINTS IN OUR

03:43:49.349 --> 03:43:50.884
PROCESS ONE IS IN OUR WORK PLAN

03:43:50.950 --> 03:43:52.252
YOU COULD ASK THAT WE PUT

03:43:52.318 --> 03:43:53.419
SOMETHING IN A WORK PLAN.

03:43:53.486 --> 03:43:55.088
CATEGORY OR CLASS OF PROP OF

03:43:55.155 --> 03:43:58.324
CHEMICALS FOR EXAMPLE --

03:43:58.391 --> 03:43:59.859
SO THAT'S ONE POINT IN THE

03:43:59.926 --> 03:44:01.394
PROCESS AND AND ANOTHER POINT IS

03:44:01.461 --> 03:44:03.496
WHEN WE ACTUALLY DETERMINE

03:44:03.563 --> 03:44:04.964
SOMETHING IS A PRIORITY PRODUCT.

03:44:05.031 --> 03:44:06.499
THAT FRANK DIRECTED US TO

03:44:06.566 --> 03:44:09.102
LEGISLATION --

03:44:09.169 --> 03:44:10.904
TO DO THAT WE COULD ADOPT THE

03:44:10.970 --> 03:44:12.539
PARTY PRODUCT AND AS SOMEONE

03:44:12.605 --> 03:44:13.740
POINTED OUT OKAY SO --

03:44:13.807 --> 03:44:14.941
FOR THE CASE WHERE I'M TALKING

03:44:15.008 --> 03:44:17.677
ABOUT WE'RE NOT SURE IT'S RIGHT.

03:44:17.744 --> 03:44:19.045
THEN WE ASK YOU TO PUT IN YOUR

03:44:19.112 --> 03:44:20.547
WORK PLAN.

03:44:20.613 --> 03:44:21.481
I THINK THERE WOULD BE AN

03:44:21.548 --> 03:44:22.315
APPROPRIATE PLACE TO LOOK

03:44:22.382 --> 03:44:23.817
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE WE

03:44:23.883 --> 03:44:24.884
IDENTIFY THOSE CATEGORIES

03:44:24.951 --> 03:44:26.352
