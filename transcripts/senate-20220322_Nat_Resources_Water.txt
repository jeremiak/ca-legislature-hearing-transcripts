ET IT'S BEEN AN INTERESTING HISTORY BECAUSE OF THE ROUGHLY TEN STATE CONSERVANCY'S. THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE REALLY SMALL. AND THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE MONUMENTALLY LARGE AND- WHEN I WAS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE I TRUSTED WITH SENATOR CALM WATERS PREDECESSOR. OF SENATOR MURRAY WHO WANTED THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THE BALDWIN HILLS CONSERVANCY. TWO SQUARE MILES OR WHATEVER IT IS AND THE SIERRA NEVADA CONSERVANCY WHICH IS. I THINK THREE MILLION ACRES. IN OUR- THIS HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THREE BILLS THAT IS ON OUR AGENDA TODAY- THAT EXPANDS THE BOUNDARIES OF CONSERVANCIES AND LAST YEAR SENATOR DOLLY. R. AS SENATOR HUESO IS BEING MOVED- I JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE UPROAR WAS KNEW IT WASN'T MY COM DID A BILL THAT EXPANDED THIS YEAR CONSERVANCY AND SO WE'RE MOVING INTO A PERIOD. WHERE PARTICULARLY WITH THE SMALLER ONES HA I THINK THE FOCUS OF A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY IN A REAL SMALL SPACES AS RUN ITS COURSE AND SOIT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO EXPAND IT AND DO THE FOCUS. IN IN THIS CASE IT IS REALLY WITH DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THAT IS REALLY THE RIGHT. OUR DIRECTION SO- I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR DOING THE BILL I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT ALL THREE OF THESE BECAUSE I THINK EVERYONE EXPANDING A CONSERVE THE BOUNDARY. THE IN A SMALLER CONSERVANCY MAKES TOTAL SENSE AND AT THE APPROPRIATE MOMENT I DO WANT TO MOVE. IT'S BETTER THAN. WE'LL TAKE THAT AS A MOTION FROM CENTER LATER BUT OTHERS WHICH ANY COMMENTS AND ARE EGGMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS CHAIR OF. I'M A HUGE FAN GREEN SPACE AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I'M ASKING EVERYBODY ABOUT EVERYTHING NOW HAS ALREADY BEEN EVALUATED FOR HOUSING BECAUSE AS MUCH AS I LIKE OPEN SPACE- I KNOW WE'RE ALSOALL STRUGGLING WITH. FINDING NEW NEW GROUNDS FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP AND LIVE ON- SO I JUST I JUST WONDER ON THIS CASE AND EVERY OTHER ONE. IF THERE'S ALREADY BEEN SOME KIND OF EVALUATION ABOUT THE- THE- THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING ABLE TO INTEGRATE ANY KIND. OF HOUSING. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EXPANDING BOUNDARIES OF SPACE. AS AN EITHER OR- EITHER OR BOTH. I'M SO I THINK I HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT I HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE BALDWIN HILLS CONSERVANCY ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR EXPANSION TERRITORY AND NO ONE HAS TALKED ABOUT HOUSING I DO ALSO KNOW THAT- THEY COUNTY- AND PARTNERS WITH THE CONSERVANCY HAVE ALSO BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN- UNDER DEVELOPED NON GREEN SPACE FOR HOUSING AND HOW TO TRANSITION EITHER UNDER UTILIZED- LIGHT INDUSTRIAL OR LIGHT COMMERCIAL. ARM BUT I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO JUST YOU KNOW GIVE YOU A DEFINITIVE ANSWER YEAH THIS IS LONGER ARE WE JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS ALL THINK ABOUT WE ARE DEFINITELY DOING ABOUT IT IN MY DISTRICT- 70% RENTERS HIGH LEVELS OF AFFORDABILITY. AND ALSO SORT OF MARRYING THAT WITH A LACK OF GREEN SPACE YEAH BOTH HUGELY HUGELY IMPORTANT ISSUES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CENTER EGGMAN OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS- YES CENTER ALLEN. I JUST WANNA LEARN THE- THE COMMITTEE- I HAVE A BILL ON ANOTHER CONSERVANCY THIS ADJACENT TO THE ONE THAT I SENT TO CONGRESS PRESENTED TO DATE THERE ACTUALLY IS A PROPOSED OVERLAP SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO GET WORKED OUT AND THAT REPRESENTS FROM THE TWO CONSERVATIVES ARE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING AND FIGURE THIS OUT WITH WITH SUPPORT CORP INCORPORATION FROM THE COMMITTEE SO. JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HIS AWARE AND- THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S- THAT'S BEING WORKED OUT WITH THAT I'D I'D LOVE TO INTO THE ETHICALLY MOVE THE ITEM OKAY- WILL BE WORKED OUT. IT WILL BE WORKED OUT THROUGH. WE OBSERVE A MOTION FROM STERLING BUT WILL SAY THAT IT IS A DOUBLE MOTION OF THESE YES STICK SUPPORT FROM SENATOR ALAN- BUT I WOULD JUST SAY JOHN WAS LESS ENTHUSIASTIC. HE BROUGHT OUT ALL THE ISSUES SERVANT IF THE AUTHORIZES WE HAVEN'T DONE ALLEN BILL YET HAVE HAD TOO MUCH COFFEE THIS MORNING- SO. I'LL BE SUPPORTING IS MEASURES WELL AND I THINK YOU KNOW. THIS PART OF LOS ANGELES IS FOR TOO LONG BEEN OVERLOOKED IS A PLACE THAT. OPEN SPACE IS POSSIBLE AND THAT WILD PLACES ARE POSSIBLE AND THAT SOMEHOW THAT OUGHT TO BE ONLY RELEGATED TO SAY THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS OR THE SANTA SUSANNA MOUNTAINS- THIS HISTORIC WATERSHED THAT THE EXPANSION IS GOING TO ENTAIL- HAS BEEN OPEN SPACE. AND WE SORT OF DENIED IT IT'S NATURAL USE- BY PAVING OVER A LOT OF THIS WATER SHOULD WE THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE SUBSTANTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR. NOT JUST INFILL DEVELOPMENT AND THE KIND OF HOUSING WE NEED BUT A RIGHT TO NATURE FOR THESE COMMUNITIES TO SO THAT WHEN YOU MOVE IN YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIVE IN A BIGGER BEEN HEAT ISLAND. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS- CESSATION OF A SUNSET THE THIS IS THE ONLY CONSERVANCY OPERATING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW WITH THAT KIND OF SUNSET DATE ON IT. DON'T SEE WHY WE'RE TREATING IT AS A TWO TIERED SYSTEM SO I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME THAT. WE WE PUT THIS CONSERVANCY ON ON EVEN FOOTING WITH THE REST OF THE STATE- SO I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING IT FORWARD CENTER AND- I LOOK FORWARD TO THE MEASURE BEING SORTED THROUGH I HAVE ONE MORE COMMENT FROM SENATOR ALAN I'M SO SORRY I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT I WENT I HAD A GREAT CHANCE TO GO WITH MY WIFE AND KIDS- TO THE TOP OF- THE BALDWIN HILLS.

YES THANK YOU FOR THE ADDED A- THE ONE OTHER POINT I WAS JUST GONNA MAKING CALLS AND BEFORE ALLOWING YOU TO CLOSE YOUR SENATORS THAT. I BELIEVE THERE'S BEEN SOME SUBSTANTIAL ANALYSIS ALSO IN THE BIO DIVERSITY BENEFITS. OF THIS. SORT OF MICRO PRO JUST IMPLEMENTING THIRTY BY THIRTY AN OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS WITHIN THE STATE- WE THINK THERE'S VALUE. NOT JUST IN QUANTITY.

HI AND THEY WOULD HAVE MORE SUCCESS IN PARTNERING WITH THE CONSERVANCY LIKE THE RMC OFFER CRITICAL PROJECTS ON THE ISLAND THAT THAT WILL REALLY BENEFIT ALL THE MANY MANY PEOPLE MILLION ANNUAL VISITORS TO THE ISLAND- SO IT'S ONE OF THE MANY MANY REASONS WHY A BILL LIKE THIS IS IMPORTANT.

FILE ITEM SEVEN HERE. OKAY YEAH LET'S DO THAT- EARLIER- WERE UP TO FILE ITEM NINE. AND JUST FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T HEARD THERE IS A REVISED ANALYSIS OF THIS ITEM. ITEM NINE S. B. NINE FORTY FIVE THE ONLY CHANGES TO THE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS WHICH NOW REFLECTS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COMMITTEE STEPHANIE AUTHOR. SO THE REVISED ANALYSIS IS WHAT IS ONLINE NOW AND SHOULD BE IN YOUR BINDERS MEMBERS. WILL HAVE COPIES OF THE REVISED AMENDMENT THOSE IN THE ROOM I WANT TO COPY. PLEASE SEE THE SERGEANTS IF YOU'D LIKE ONE I'M SAID EARLIER WITH THAT PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR. AND THANKS FOR YOUR- YOU AND YOUR STAFF YOU TIME AND ATTENTION TO THE SENATE BILL NINE FORTY FIVE WHICH I'M PRESENTING. AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT'S ON THE RECORD. SENATE BILL NINE FORTY FIVE ALLOWS A CALIFORNIA LICENSED FALCONER. TO CAPTURE POSSESS AND TRAINED AMERICAN PEREGRINE FALCON IN THE PRACTICE OF FALCONRY. THE HUNTING OF WILD ANIMALS IN THEIR NATURAL STATE AND HABITAT. A BY A MEANS OF A TRAINED BIRD OF. PREY THE WORD TAKE HAS BEEN USED. IN OTHER INSTANCES IT MIGHT MEAN WE'RE LITERALLY TAKING THE LIFE OF THE SPECIES BUT IN THIS CASE. THE TAKE IS TO POSSESS AND TRAIN. WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION. AND PEOPLE MIGHT SAY WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL. OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL. IS TO ALLOW POSSESSION OF A PEREGRINE FOR FALCONRY ACCORDING TO THE LIMIT SET BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AS IN ELEVEN OTHER STATES. AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF. THE REHABILITATION AND RESCUE BIRDS FOR EXAMPLE. BOB PEREGRINES NEST ON MOST BRIDGES IN THE BAY AREA AROUND THE STATE. SUCH AS THE VINCENT THOMAS BRIDGE THE BAY BRIDGE TO SAN RAFAEL BRIDGE. UP AND OTHERS. YOUNG PEREGRINES ARE CLUMSY. AND OFTEN FLOODS INTO THE WATER AND DROWN BECAUSE THEY MAKE POOR LANDINGS AFTER THEIR FIRST FLIGHTS. BUT UNDER CURRENT LAW- NOBODY'S ALLOWED TO SAVE THEM- OR DO A TAKE THAT IS TO TAKE FOR ACTUALLY TRAINING AND POSSESSING. SO UNDER THIS BILL A LICENSED FALCONER MAY POSSESS AN AMERICAN PEREGRINE FALCON AND USE IT IN FALCONRY WORK WHEREAS CURRENTLY THEY CANNOT. AND JUST FOR BACKGROUND BEGINNING IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES DUE TO THE WIDESPREAD USE OF PESTICIDES SUCH AS DDT A PRECIPITOUS DECLINE IN THE POPULATION HAPPENED. IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES FULLY PROTECTED PROVISIONS OF THE FISH AND GAME CODE WERE ESTABLISHED AS CALIFORNIA'S INITIAL EFFORT TO IDENTIFY. ADDITIONAL PROTECTION BUT TO FULLY PROTECTED LIST PROHIBITED POSSESSION AND TAKE OF THE AMERICAN PEREGRINE FALCON FOR FEMALE CANARY. AND THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT AS LONG SINCE REPLACED FISH AND GAME CODE TO FULLY PROTECTED SO THIS WILL ALLOW LICENSED FALCONERS WHO MUCH PASS A WRITTEN TEST. IN ADDITION TO UNDERGOING A TWO YEAR APPRENTICESHIP TO AGAIN USED A PEREGRINE FALCON IN THE PRACTICE OF FALCONRY. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. IS STEWART A LICENSE FALCONER WITH THE UC SANTA CRUZ PREDATORY BIRD RESEARCH GROUP AND BILL FERRIER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HAWKING CLUB- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE FROM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WANNA HEAR FROM OUR LEAD WITNESSES YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TOTAL- PLEASE PROCEED. BUT AGAIN MY NAME IS GLEN STEWART. I'M RETIRED DIRECTOR OF THE UC SANTA CRUZ PREDATORY BIRD RESEARCH GROUP AND I'VE BEEN A FALCONER FOR FIFTY YEARS. I'M ASKING YOU TODAY TO AGAIN GET FAULCONER IS ACCESS TO THE CLASSIC BIRDSALL CAN READ THE PEREGRINE FALCONS. AND I SAY AGAIN BECAUSE WE HAVE TO USE THEM AND FALCONERI FOR FOUR THOUSAND YEARS. EXCEPT DURING THE PAST FIFTY. WHEN THEY'RE USED TO SUSPENDED WHY BECAUSE OF DDT AS SENATOR LAYERED POINTED OUT. IT DECIMATED THEIR POPULATIONS WORLDWIDE. CALIFORNIA DID THE RIGHT THING BY IMPLEMENTING FULLY PROTECTED THE FISHING GAME COACH THREE YEARS AGO BUT IS NOW ANTIQUATED LAW. IT FULLY PROTECTS BIRDS THAT NO LONGER NEED PROTECTION WHILE THE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT PROTECTS THOSE THE DEAL. CALIFORNIA TODAY THAN AT ANY TIME IN HISTORY. I WAS A PART OF THE TEAM AT UC SANTA CRUZ THAT HELPED. JOBS BEEN DONE. BEEN FINISHED FOR TWENTY YEARS. DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IS DOCUMENTED A ROBUST POPULATION REMOVED THE PEREGRINE FROM THE STATE'S ENDANGERED SPECIES LAPSED. AND DEPARTMENT RECENTLY UPDATED FALCONRY REGULATIONS THAT GOVERN THE USE OF WILD BIRDS AND FALKIRK RIGHT. IF YOU HAVE A BIRD BOOK. ON YOUR SHELF IT IS LIKELY THAT ROGER TORY PETERSON WROTE IT LIKE TO READ FIRST TWO SENTENCES OF HIS PEREGRINE FALCON ACCOUNT. ITS BOOK BIRDS OVER AMERICA SPEAK SHARPLY. WITH THE BIRD. MANAGED FROM THE AVENTURE.

YOUR SENSE OF- BECAUSE I APPLIED THE SAME SORT OF STANDARD IN QUESTION TO. OTHER BILLS MOVING THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE THAT MAY HAVE- AN IMPACT ON THE SERVER BASED BUDGETING OCCURRING AT THE DEPARTMENT- HOPING FOR YOUR YOUR FEEDBACK THERE ARE KNOW THAT IT'S- AN ISSUE THAT WILL HOPEFULLY BE WORKED ON- IN FISCAL COMMITTEE BUT- FOR THE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF DATA RIGHT NOW IN THE LACK OF A- I MANAGED. PLAN I THINK WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'VE GOT ALL THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THE- OVERALL SPECIES REMAINS INTACT- WITH HIS PRACTICE IN PLACE JUST GIVEN THE LACK OF DATA UST HOPING YOU COULD- PROVIDE SOME ASSURANCE OR COMMENTARY FOR THE RECORD. WELL LET ME PROVIDE SOME COMMENTARY WHICH IS THERE SOME THINGS THAT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE WOULD BE DOING REGARDLESS OF THIS BILL. IN I THINK SOMEHOW THEY GET SWEPT INTO THIS AS WELL SO I THINK THE COSTS AS A RESULT OF THIS BILL ARE MINIMAL. BUT AT THE SAME TIME- THAT THEY HAVE PLANS THAT THEY HAVE TO DO REGARDLESS BENDIS WILL NOW BE INCLUDED IN SOME WAYS IN THE PLANS THAT THEY HAVE TO DO REGARDLESS AND- I'M A MEMBER OF THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE WILL MAKE SURE THIS IS FULLY VETTED AND THAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I AND I ALSO WANT TO JUST THANK YOU FOR THE AMENDMENTS AND JUST TO BE CLEAR THE ANALYSIS DOES NOTE IT'S NOT KNOWN WHAT IMPACT. THIS AUTHORIZATION WOULD HAVE BUT- WE HOPE THIS LEGISLATIVE REPORTING CRIME IS A LONG WAYS TO THAT SO WE APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH US. WE HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR HERTZBERG- IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD JUST THANK THE WITNESSES. IN SUPPORT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. PHONE. OKAY CHIEF CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL I'D LEAVE THE- MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED- AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. FILE ITEM NINE S. B. FOUR FIVE MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS STERN HI STERN ALL RIGHT. JONES HI ALAN. ALLEN AYE EGGMAN. EGGMAN ALL RIGHT GROVE- HERTZBERG. HERTZBERG ALL RIGHT HUESO. WE ON A LAYER AYE LAYERED AYE LIMÓN. MON ALL RIGHT OUT- WE WILL MOVE ON. TO ROUND WOULD YOU LIKE PROCEED ON ABOUT- FILE ITEM. ESPYS TEN SEVENTY EIGHT MEMBERS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR SO S. AS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW LAST YEAR I INTRODUCED A BILL THAT WAS SIMILAR TO THIS ONE- WHICH PASSED THE LEGISLATURE WITH BROAD BROAD BI. SUPPORT THE WE SEEM TO- THE GOAL. IS TO ESTABLISH A SEA LEVEL RISE REVOLVING LOAN FUND TO PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH AN INNOVATIVE FINANCING OPTION TO ALLEVIATE THE RISKS. OF SEA LEVEL RISE WHILE PROTECTING BOTH PROPERTY OWNERS AND TAXPAYERS- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BECOME A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR A LOT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE L. A. TIMES THAT A FASCINATING PIECE ON THIS. I THAT I COMMEND EVERYONE IT'S BEEN A REALLY HIGHLIGHTED THAT THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES AND AN EXCRUCIATING CHALLENGES THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE FACING THE HAVE A GROUP OF. HOMEOWNERS WHO LIVE RIGHT ON THE COAST WHO ARE COMING IN ASKING THEM TO SPEND MORE AND MORE OF THEIR MEAGER CITY BUDGETS ON. FIGHTING BACK AGAINST SEA LEVEL RISE WHILE THERE YOU KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO FIND OTHER. NEEDS FROM YOU KNOW PARKS AND SENIOR PROGRAMS- TRANSPORTATION LAW ENFORCEMENT WHATEVER ELSE. SO THE IDEA HERE IS THAT WE WOULD CREATE A OF AN ABSOLUTE VOLUNTARY. LOAN FUND THAT WOULD CANCEL OUT IT WOULD BREAK EVEN- YOU WOULD PROVIDE THIS FINANCING TOOL OVER THE WOULD LOAN MONEY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT COULD THEN BUY PROPERTIES THAT WILL BE THREATENED BY SEA LEVEL RISE. IN A DECADE OR TWO ENABLING THE OWNERS TO SELL WHILE THE PROPERTY STILL HAVE VALUE AND THEN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COULD AND RAN OUT THE PROPERTY. REPAYING THE LOAN A POTENTIALLY EVEN EARNING REVENUE. I WHEN THE PROPERTY IS NO LONGER INHABITABLE DUE TO THE RISK OF FLOODING FROM RISING SEA LEVELS THE HOUSE COULD BE DEMOLISHED OR RELOCATED WITHOUT. THE LOCAL RESIDENTS OR TAXPAYERS BEARING THE COST. SO ON THE GOVERNOR VETOED THE BILL LAST YEAR WE READ HIS VETO STATEMENT TALK TO POKE THE MINISTRATION VERY CAREFULLY AND WE'VE ADJUSTED OUR PROPOSAL. IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE STATE COMPTROLLER WHO WILL BE TESTIFYING SHORTLY AND WE WOULD JUST OF THE PROPOSED IN TWO KEY WAYS THAT WE THINK WILL ADDRESS THE GOVERNOR'S CONCERNS FIRST OF ALL THE BILL PRIORITIZES. FUNDING FIRST A LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN THOSE HARDEST HIT BY CLIMATE CHANGE THE BILL ALSO CALLS FOR PARTICIPATING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CRAFT. PROJECT- THE PROPERTY VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS. AND TO INCORPORATE THESE ASSESSMENTS INTO THEIR CURRENT. LOCAL COASTAL PLAN. HI THIS WILL BE ENSURE THAT THE NEW PROGRAM IS WELL INTEGRATED INTO EXISTING EFFORTS TO ADDRESS YOU AUTHORIZE COURTNEY WITH THE PRO TIMES SB ONE THAT WE PASSED LAST YEAR. I SAW IT AS A MENTION LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ARE THEIR THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS WHILE BALANCING. VERY LIMITED BUDGETS. THEY'RE NOT MANY OPTIONS AND ALSO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF LOCAL RESIDENTS PROPERTY OWNERS- YEAH THIS IS BEEN A REAL ISSUE OF CONTROVERSY A LOT OF COMMUNITIES IN THE COURSE BUILDING SEA WALLS WHICH OF COURSE IS THE- THE PREFERRED- MITIGATION IS THIS NOT JUST EXPENSIVE BUT- AS YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT IT COMES WITH A- SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES FIRST OF ALL. YOU CAN NEVER WIN AGAINST THE C. IN THE LONG RUN BUT IT ALSO IMPACTS. THE FLOW OF SAND AND THAT HAS IMPACTS ON ON YOUR WHEN ONE COMMITTEE BILL TO SEE WALL IT NEGATIVELY IMPACTS OTHER COASTAL COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE COAST. I BECAUSE IT KIND OF PUSHES OFF THE PROBLEM ON TO THEM. TO ALL THE CHOICES WE NEED TO MAKE ARE TOUGH- THEY'LL GET A WHOLE LOT HARDER WHEN INSURANCE COMPANIES REFUSE TO COVER PROPERTIES AND BANKS WILL PROVIDE MORTGAGES AND THEN WERE ASKED TO STEP IN AND TRY TO HELP. HELP OUT I JUST THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE LIVES AND TREASURE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED IF- WE TAKEN PROACTIVE ACTION TWO DECADES AGO HOW TO PREVENT. OR TO LEAST OF REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES THAT WE NOW HAVE. SO WITH ME HERE TO SPEAK TODAY I JUST WANT TO THANK OUR TO OUR OUR STATE'S CHIEF FISCAL OFFICER STATE CONTROLLER BETTY YEE- FOR HER SUPPORT AND HER ENGAGEMENT. DEEP ENGAGEMENT ON THIS BILL AS WELL AS ISABEL GONZALEZ POTTER REPRESENTING. THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. VERY VERY- WILL TURN TO THE LEAD WITNESSES THEN- AND STATE CONTROLLER YOU ON THE LINE WITH US. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CHRISTINA CONGLETON THE CONTROLLER DEPUTY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY CONTROL HE CENTRAL POLICIES HE SHE'S GOT ANOTHER CALL. I WOULD HAVE TO BUY TODAY ON HER BEHALF OKAY PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY ON AT TEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND IMPORTANT BILL THE CONTROLLER IS PLEASED TO SPONSOR. AND SEVENTY EIGHT IN THE BILL THAT WHILE PROACTIVELY ADDRESSED THE EXPONENTIAL THREAT AT THE LEVEL RIDE. WE OFTEN THINK OF LEVEL RISES BEING BARRED. BUT EXTREME AND NUISANCE IN BLOCKED THE ARE ALREADY FOR HOME AND CAL. COPPING CHARACTER FIND INVITE IMPACTS. A CALIFORNIA CHIEF FISCAL. CONTROLLER HE REALIZES THAT THE RISKIEST RESPONSE TO SEALEVEL RISE IS IN ACTION. WITHIN THE NEXT THREE DECADES THE LEVEL RIDE THE FORECAST TO COST MORE THAN SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN PROPERTY DAMAGE ON CALIFORNIA'S COASTLINE. EXACERBATING EXISTING SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUITIES. PARTICULARLY FOR INDIGENOUS AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR. WHEN POSSIBLE AND PRACTICAL THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO AVOID THE IMPACT OF SEA LEVEL RISE. IT'S A NEW PEOPLE AND PROPERTIES AWAY FROM RISING SEAS. HOWEVER ADAPTATION STRATEGIES TO BE DESIGNED TO MEET THE NEEDS FOR EACH OF CALIFORNIANS. COMMUNITY I THE TIME THAT WE GET A COMP THAT FILE LOW JR. TO DETERMINE IF THAT PROGRAM IS BEAUTIFUL FOR THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS. ALL ALLOWING ON TO BUY. PART BUT THE PROBES PROVIDE OPPORTUNE TO TAKE A PRO TO A STATEWIDE. DOING FELL WILL ALIGN WITH THE L. A. O. TWENTY RECOMMENDED FACT ON SEALABLE RIGHT PREPARATIONS NOW. TO AVOID LOST OPPORTUNITY AND HIGH COSTS WHAT MONTH IDC FEAR REITERATED THAT JUST AND EQUITY HOW THINK AND ON HOW THE FACT AT CAN BE. AT SEVENTY ENSURE THE COMMUNITIES WITH THE GREATEST NEED FOR SUPPORT FIRST BEFORE HE LEVEL RIGHTS RELATED FLOODING IMPACTS VALUE OF THEIR HOME. IN THE U. S. MOST BY OUT POLICIES ARE REACTIONARY. TO NATURAL DISASTERS REQUIRE RESIDENTS TO IMMEDIATELY ABANDON THE PROPERTY IMPACTING RENTERS AND ADDING STRESS TO REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS. AT THE TEN SEVENTY EIGHT A VOICE BY FOR THE STATE WITH AN INVALUABLE. TO PLANET. WITHIN A PRE DEVELOPED CONTACT AND ALLOW RESIDENTS REMAIN IN THEIR HOME UNTIL IT NO LONGER HABITABLE. COUNTING TIME PER. WITH A CRITICAL NEED FOR HELPING. AT THE TIME THAT EIGHT IS A GROUND WITH A WIDE VIEW OF RIGHT POLICY AND THE FACT OF SCIENCE WE HAVE A SHORT WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN INNOVATIVE DEAL ALL RIGHT POLICY. WE CANNOT TO WAIT TO ACT BUT THE SLOW MOVING AND PREDICTABLE. OF SEA LEVEL RISE CREATE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GET AHEAD OF THE CURVE TODAY. I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU.

TEND BACK TO THE DIES THEN MEMBERS COMMENTS QUESTIONS- CENTER LAYERED THANK YOU- MISTER CARE. D. A. I THINK THAT THE AUTHOR AND THE WITNESSES BUT MADE A VERY GOOD CASE. IN AND WITH REGARD TO MISS POTTER I THINK SHE WAS ACTUALLY MARC WITH POLITE BECAUSE WHEN I WAS RESOURCES SECRETARY. I WOULD SAY GRAPHICALLY IF YOU STICK YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND YOU WILL DROWN IN THE AUTHOR MADE A COMMENT ABOUT IF WE HAD DONE A BILL FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS AGO AND REQUIRED GENERAL PLANS. OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALONG THE COAST TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SEA LEVEL RISE AND I. RAN INTO THIS CONFLICT IN OF ALL PLACES THE STATE SENATE- WHICH WAS HALF THE STAKEHOLDERS SAID. WE WON'T SUPPORT THIS BILL AND UNLESS YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC BASELINE FOR PLANNING AND THE OTHER HALF SAID WE WON'T SUPPORT THIS BILL IF YOU DO HAVE A SPECIFIC BASELINE FOR PLANNING. AND I COULDN'T GET IT OUT OF THE SENATE. AND OF THE WORLD HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN. IN THE IN THE SENSE THAT. THIS IS UPON US AND PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE GOING TO ASK WHY WE DIDN'T TAKE EVEN STRONGER STEPS. AND THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE PLACES WHERE WE HAVE TO HAVE AN ALL OF THE ABOVE STRATEGY WE HAVE TO DO THIS ANY OF A NUMBER OF WAYS BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE AN OVERWHELMING PROBLEM. ARE ARE ON THE COAST AND ARE BASED IN SO- I APPRECIATE THE ATTEMPT TO THE OFFICER TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON THE VETO I THINK HE- HAS THE AUTHOR HAS ADDRESSED. FROM MANY OF THE ISSUES AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO MOVE THIS BILL HAD STRONGLY SO WE SEND THE SIGNAL THAT WE SUPPORT THE ALL OF THE ABOVE AND FORCE THE NEGOTIATIONS. THAT SHOULD HAPPEN IF THEY HAVEN'T- IF THIS BILL DOESN'T ALREADY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THOSE BECAUSE WE NEED TO DO MANY DIFFERENT SITES WITH THE AUTHOR.

LAST YEAR BILL- BECAUSE I AGREED WITH YOU THOSE INNOVATIVE AND I AND I THOUGHT WE WERE MOVING IN THE RIGHT RIGHT DIRECTION THE SO THE QUESTION FOR THIS BILL IS I DON'T UNDERSTAND AFTER READING THE- GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE. HOW THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE CONCERNS THAT THE GOVERNOR RAISED AND- REGARDING- FUNDING AND THEN- YOU KNOW GENERAL PLANNING PROCESS FOR THE ENTIRE STATE IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME THAT THIS BILL ACTUALLY NARROWS. THE. IMPACT OF THE BILL WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS RATHER THAN BASED ON RISK- SO JUST WONDERING IF YOUCOULD KIND OF SPEAK TO THE GOVERNOR'S VETO AND HOW THIS ADDRESSES IT. WELL I MEAN IT DOES WE DO WE DO- PUT FOCUS ON ON RISK AS WELL BECAUSE WE HAD AND- THOSE PARTICIPATE CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH WOULD YOU KNOW INCLUDE THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE- LIKELY TO HAVE THEIR PROPERTIES INVOLVED BY THE BY THE SEA.

MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THE PARTICIPATING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO REALLY GET SOME SKIN IN THE GAME AND SURE THAT THEIR PROPERTY ONE OF THE LEAST ESTIMATES ARE ARE. PERFORATED INTO THEIR CURRENT LOCAL COASTAL PLANS- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE OFF THE GOOD EVENING WE'VE BEEN TO THE PRESS TIMES OFFICE AND SHE AUTHORED SB ONE- WE CERTAINLY WOULD WANT TO SEE THIS FOLDED INTO A KIND OF THE FOR THE BROADER WORK THAT'S HAPPENING UNDER SB ONE AND THEY THEY CERTAINLY OPEN TO THAT.
