WE'LL WAIT UP FOR THE QUORUM IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH ITEMS THAT ARE VOTE ONLY. BUT WE WILL GO -- TO ITEM FIFTY TWO TWENTY FIVE ISSUE. ONE WHICH DEALS WITH THE CAPITAL DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION CAPITAL OUTLAY IN FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PRIORITIZATION AND MASTER PLAN FOR RENOVATION PLACE ONE OF ORIGINAL. PRISON STUDY BUDGET PROPOSAL. ON PAGE. THREE SO WILL BEGIN WITH THAT I'D. OUR PANELISTS IS FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. PART OF FINANCE IN THE LA -- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM -- ERIC SWANSON DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CDC OURS OFFICE OF FISCAL SERVICES. THIS FIRST ISSUE DEALS WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF IT -- AREAS OF EXPERTISE AT CDC ARE SO WE KIND OF ARE TAKING A PALE APPROACH TO IT -- THE ONE BUDGET ACTION ON THE AGENDA IS A REQUEST TO EXTEND THE REVERSION DATE. OF FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION FOR A STUDY THAT WILL. LOOK AT THE STATE PRISON IS CONSTRUCTED PRIOR. TO NINETEEN EIGHTY HOWEVER THE AGENDA ALSO ASKED THE DEPARTMENT TO DESCRIBE. KIND OF THE FACTORS THAT GO INTO OUR MAINTENANCE AND CAPITAL OUTLAY DECISION MAKING. SO WITH ME TODAY IS DEBORAH HYSON. DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF FACILITY PLANNING CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT. KATHLEEN ALISON ACTING'S UNDERSECRETARY OF OPERATIONS. AND JULIE BASCO WHO HAS A REALLY LONG TITLE BUT I'M GONNA SHORTEN IT. SHE'S DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH OKAY FINE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS DEBORAH HYSAN I'M THE DIRECTOR FACILITY PLANNING CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT FOR THE DEPARTMENT. I'M GOING TO GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW ON HOW WE PRIORITIZE OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY -- PROJECTS BUT I WANTED TO INDICATE THAT THE PRIVATIZATION PROCESS FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY. IS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ITEM AND ITEM TWO AND SO INSTEAD OF BEING REDUNDANT THERE I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE GOOD TO SHOW TO SHOW YOU HOW WE DO THAT. AND WHY THAT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT AS IT FEEDS INTO HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING OUR TWELVE PRESENTS. SO JUST A BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE DEPARTMENT OPERATES THIRTY FOUR STATE OWNED FACILITIES -- OVER FORTY THREE MILLION SQUARE FEET AND ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND STRUCTURES. ARE FACILITIES ARE OLD EVEN OUR NEWER PRISONS HAS A REFER TO OUR OLD 60% OF OUR FACILITIES AT OUR IN FACT THIRTY YEARS OR OLDER. AND 35% OR FIFTY YEARS OR OLDER. AND WHAT WHAT THIS MEANS TO US IS THAT WE'VE GOT CONDITIONS IN OUR FACILITIES WHERE THE USEFUL LIFE THAT WAS PLANNED FOR THAT FACILITY. HAS LONG SINCE EXCEEDED AND SO IN RECOGNITION OF THAT IN TWENTY ELEVEN WE PERFORM SOME CONDITION ASSESSMENTS. WITH AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT THAT IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF DEFICIENCIES -- THAT EXISTED IN OUR PRISON PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY WEREN'T REPLACED. DURING THE THAT RECOMMENDED CYCLES ASSESSMENT YIELDED AN AVERAGE RATING ACROSS OUR PORTFOLIO OF 60%. INDUSTRY STANDARD -- FOR FOR FACILITIES OF OUR TYPE IS THAT IF YOU ACHIEVE A 65% MORE OR MORE RATING -- THAT CAN THAT FACILITY CONDITION IS KNOWN AS POOR ARE EXTREMELY POOR AND WHAT THAT TELLS ME AS A FACILITY -- MANAGER IS THAT I HAVE TO START A PLANNING CYCLE THAT IDENTIFIES HOW THAT FACILITY CAN BE REPLACED OR SIGNIFICANTLY REPAIRED SO CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE FOR ITS PURPOSE -- SO -- WITHOUT IN HAND IN TWENTY ELEVEN WE STARTED TO SUBMIT AYE. A SERIES OF PROPOSALS THAT WOULD ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONDITIONS AND WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE TO GET A NUMBER OF A SUPPLEMENTAL APPROACH APPROPRIATIONS ALONG THE WAY -- BUT WHAT I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS THE PLANNING PROCESS THAT WE UNDERTAKEN WE DO THIS WORK. SO I'M PLANNING IS IT RUDE. ITERATIVE. I'M MORE ALWAYS IN THE PLANNING STAGE -- WE ARE ALWAYS OUT IN THE FIELD WE SPEAKING -- TO CODE OFFICIALS ON WHAT UPCOMING CODE CHANGES ARE IN PLACE. INTERACTING WITH REGULATORS ON SOME OF THE OUR FACILITIES THAT HAVE REGULATORY IMPLICATIONS. AND SO WE'RE ALWAYS GATHERING THAT INFORMATION. I'M AND AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE'RE GATHERING THE FIELD INFORMATION ALSO SPEAKING TO EXECUTIVES. TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY CAPPING ALISON INJURY BASCO ART TO KEY EXECUTIVES THAT I WOULD SPEAK TO BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND. THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE IMPACTING -- HOW WE OPERATE OUR FACILITIES THERE ARE POLICY IMPLICATIONS THERE ARE TRENDING INFORMATION? MISSION CHANGES -- ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT INPUT INTO THE PLANNING PROCESS FOR WHAT SOUNDS LIKE A SIMPLE -- FACILITY RELATED -- EXERCISE. SO SO THE OTHER THING THAT WE LOOK AT ONE WORD DOING THIS THIS EFFORT IS WE LOOK AT WHERE OUR ASSETS WHAT IS THE CONDITION OF THESE ASSETS. DO WE HAVE ANY DATA ON THE ASSETS HOW ARE THEY OPERATING FOR THE INTENDED PURPOSE -- WHAT ARE -- INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NEEDED TO KEEP THAT ASSET OPERATING IN SO AGAIN ALL OF THOSE -- INPUTS ARE IN PLACE I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LOOK AT IS IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOT JUST LOOK AT STATE ON ASSETS BUT CONSIDER OP PRIVATE OR OUTSIDE ASSETS. AND SOMETIMES THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THEY CAN -- DELIVERED TO US FASTER FOR HAVING A POPULATION PRESSURE BUT SOMETIMES IT JUST MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE THAT POPULATION IN THE COMMUNITY AND A SMALLER SETTING. SO WE LOOK AT NOT ONLY HOW WE PRIORITIZE ASSETS FOR STATE OWNED BUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S AN OFFRAMP. TO DELIVER THAT THE NEEDED MISSION IN A DIFFERENT FASHION. SO THAT'LL SETS THE STAGE FOR THE VERY FORMAL PROCESS WE CALL THE CALL LETTER PROCESS. WHERE WE SEEK -- EACH INSTITUTION TO SEND US A DETAILED PROJECT -- SCOPE TO US WITH PRELIMINARY COST ESTIMATES. THOSE COME IN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND THEN WE SIT DOWN WITH THE EXECUTIVES OF THE DIFFERENT OPERATING DIVISIONS. AND WE GO THROUGH THEM AND THE THE FACTORS WE USED TO DETERMINE WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A PRIORITY PROJECT. IS IT NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH STATUTORY AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. DOESN'T ADDRESS FIRE LIFE SAFETY CONDITIONS IS IT NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE COURT MANDATE. IS IT NEEDED TO ADDRESS ACCESS COMPLIANCE. IS IT NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN ONGOING OPERATIONS IN PROGRAMMING HEALTH CARE HOUSING SECTOR. THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THIS LIST THAT WE'RE GATHERING BETWEEN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND SPECIAL CARE AND CAPITAL OUTLAY. IS THAT WE ALSO ASK IS THE PROJECT THAT IS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE UPON THOSE OPERATIONS SO THAT. IMPROVEMENT THAT BETTERMENT IF YOU WILL IS TYPICALLY FALLS IN THE CAPITAL OUTLAY DOCKET. SO ONCE WE REACHED INTERNAL CONSENSUS AS IT RELATES TO THE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECT. WE GATHER ABOUT TWENTY TO THIRTY PROJECTS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE NECESSARY TO BETTER THE OPERATIONS -- THAT EXIST IN OUR PRISONS AND THOSE ARE SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EACH YEAR. I IN AUGUST OF EACH YEAR AND DEPENDING ON HOW ON THEIR VIEW OF OF THESE PROJECTS. THERE ARE SUBMITTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND IF APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE WE AND ACT UPON THEM. I'M THE COMMITTEE HAS I BELIEVE A SUMMARY OF THE CAPITAL OUTLAY REQUEST AND I'D BE HAPPY. TO SPEAK ABOUT THOSE PARTICULAR -- PROJECTS IF YOU'D LIKE I'M. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU ASKED FOR WAS THE TWELVE PRISON STUDY THE UPDATE ON THE TWELVE PRISON STUDY -- IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CAP OUT LIKE TO MOVE ON TO THE TOP PRISON STUDY. OKAY SO THE TWELVE PRISON STUDY -- IT'S IT'S IN A SENSE OF FOLLOW ON TO THE INITIAL FACILITY ASSESSMENT THAT WE DID IN TWENTY ELEVEN IT'S A DEEPER DIVE A FEW WELL. IT'S TAKING -- THE A SERIOUS LOOK AT OUR TWELVE OLDEST PRISONS KNOWING THAT THEY WILL HAVE EXCEEDED THEIR USEFUL LIFE MUCH FASTER THAN OUR NEW PRISONS -- AND INDEED IF YOU'VE BEEN TO SOME. I'M. BEFORE I GO INTO THAT -- TOLD PRISON STUDY I WANT -- TO BE CLEAR THAT. WHEN PEOPLE CALL 206-7 WAS ENACTED? THE LEGISLATURE ASKED US TO CONSIDER A NUMBER OF FACTORS IN EVALUATING -- WHETHER OR NOT ARE FACILITY RELATED REQUESTS -- WOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR FUNDING. I THINK I OUTLINED FOR YOU THE CRITERIA THAT THAT WE USE IN THE PLANNING EFFORT TO DEVELOP THIS -- THIS APPROACH. I WANNA GIVEN A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF HOW WE VIEWS THE TWENTY SIXTY SEVEN LANGUAGE. I'M IN EARLIER IN THE DECADE WHEN THE JUVENILE FACILITY POPULATION WAS DECLINING WE DID A SIMILAR ANALYSIS TO WHAT'S BEING ASKED HIM -- TWENTY SIXTY SEVEN AND WE DETERMINED THAT BASED ON THAT ANALYSIS THAT WE COULD CLOSE -- SEVERAL JUVENILE FACILITIES. AND WE LOOKED AT FACTORS THAT WERE IMPORTANT IN JUVENILE OPERATIONS ARE THEY IN COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY ARE -- WELL SERVED BY VOLUNTEERS. ARE THEY IN COMMUNITIES WHERE HI FOLKS COULD HIRE EFFECTIVELY -- WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THE ASSET SPENCE NEEDED FOR THAT ASSN WE USE THAT SAME PRIVATIZATION PROCESS? ON TO MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS WE ALSO USE A SIMILAR PROCESS WHEN WE EVALUATED A DECLINING FEMALE POPULATION. POPULATION WILL CONTINUE TO DECLINE WE WE EVALUATED OUR PRISONS AND DETERMINED WE COULD CLOSE. AND REPURPOSE -- THE VALLEY STATE PRISON AND AND TURN IT INTO ADULTS BUT KNOWING THAT THERE WAS A POPULATION SHORTFALL WE OPENED A FEMALE FACILITY IN FOLSOM. AND WE DID THAT AGAIN WITH ALL THAT CRITERION MIND -- FULSOME IS A GOOD LOCATION FOR HIRING -- FEMALES -- AND AND IT'S A SMALLER FACILITY SO SO IT'S WILL SERVICE. THE NEED WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH FOR THREE LARGE PRISONS WE WE STILL HAD NEED MORE THAN TWO SO. ON THE FULL SOME WOMEN'S FACILITY GAVE US ENOUGH OF THE OF THE BUFFER THERE. I'M I'M. A REAL KEY INDICATOR FOR US IS THE POPULATION -- THAT WE SERVE SO WE LOOK AT A FIVE YEAR HORIZON FOR IT FOR OUR POPULATION AND THE REASON WHY WE LOOK AT THE FIVE YEARS IS BECAUSE IT TYPICALLY TAKES FIVE YEARS FROM INCEPTION OF AN IDEA OF A PROJECT. TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING ON THE PROJECT SO IT'S AN IMPORTANT -- FACTOR FOR US AND WE ACTUALLY -- MAINTAIN WHAT'S CALLED A GAP CHART IT'S IN THE A AND A MASTER PLAN THE DEPARTMENT PUBLISHES. AND THAT GOT CHART LAYS OUT WHERE OUR POPULATION IS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE FACTORS WE USE -- WHEN WE'RE DOING OUR PLANNING EFFORT? I'M SORRY I WANTED -- TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO YOU THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT -- PIECE OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE PLANNING THE FUTURE ALL THOSE CRITERIA ARE IN FACT QUITE HERE WE'RE LOOKING AT WE'RE JUST GONNA BE MUCH MORE SPECIFIC AND HOW WE INCLUDE THAT. PLANNING EFFORTS IN THE FUTURE. SO THE TOTAL PRISON STUDY AGAIN OUR IS A DEEPER DIVE IN THE CONTINUATION OF OUR FORMER ASSESSMENTS. AND WE'LL ASK THE CONSULTANT TO DEVELOP A LIST OF PROJECTS THAT WE NEED -- THAT WE BELIEVE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MAY AFFECT OF OPERATIONS IN OUR PRISON. I'M I'VE SEEN A COUPLE OF THOSE EARLIER DRAFTS AND THOSE DROPS INDICATE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A COMBINATION OF SPECIAL CARE AND FOR MAINTENANCE PROJECTS BUT ALSO CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS -- UNFORTUNATELY THEIR WORK HAS -- SUFFERED -- THEY HAVE I THINK THAT THEY UNDERESTIMATED THE WORK EFFORT THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO DO THE TWELVE PRISON STUDY. ON THE EARLY DRAFTS THAT I'VE SEEN WOULD PROVE LITTLE UTILITY FOR US AS A DEPARTMENT IN DETERMINING WHERE. WE NEED TO INVEST OUR PRECIOUS RESOURCES GOING FORWARD SO WE SPENT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME WITH THEM WORKING ON AT ITS -- AND CHANGES TO THE DOCUMENT -- THEY'VE HAD ANY NUMBER OF ERRORS FROM COST ESTIMATE ERRORS -- TO PROJECT TWO FALSE ASSUMPTIONS -- ON WHAT PROJECTS WOULD BE NEEDED -- TO PROCEED AND IT'S JUST BEEN A PRODUCT THAT -- UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME. COMMENTS FROM LA L.. CAITLYN LA -- WE DIDN'T RAISE CONCERNS ON THIS PROPOSAL OKAY WHAT ABOUT -- FINANCE. OKAY ANY MEMBERS QUESTIONS. YES MISTER. TEN SO I I APOLOGIZE FOR WALKING AND THEY SEE MY PRETTY COVER THIS BUT CAN YOU CHANGES WALK THROUGH WHY THE DELAY SO -- YOU KNOW IT'S JUST A MYRIAD OF FACTORS -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY NEEDED TO DO WAS TO USE CERTAIN REFERENCE DOCUMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT. AS AN EXAMPLE AND THEIR EFFORT -- I THINK THEY HAD A GREATER EXPERT TAKE EXPECTATION OF THE DEGREE OF DOCUMENTATION ON BLUEPRINTS FOR THE OLDER PRISONS THAT EXISTED -- THOSE ARE ABSOLUTELY KEY WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S BURIED BENEATH WALLS AND FLOORS -- AND WE SIMPLY DIDN'T HAVE THOSE FOR SOME OF THE ESPECIALLY SOME OF THE VERY OLD PRISONS -- AND SO THEY HAD TO SPEND A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO TRYIN -- UNDERSTAND THAT ON THEIR OWN -- THEY ALSO WE ALSO OF THE FORMER SCA ASSESSMENT DONE BY AND ANOTHER. CONSULTANT AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT THAT WOULD PROVE VALUABLE TO THEM BUT I IT'S A NEXT IT WAS AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF DATA I DON'T THINK THEY REALLY. APPRECIATED UNDERSTOOD HOW THEY COULD TRANSLATE THAT DAY IT DATA INTO THEIR WORK EFFORT. SO THOSE INITIAL REPORTS CAME IN -- WITH -- THINGS LIKE COULD NOT UNDERSTANDING HOW TO APPLY THE FCI INDEX IN A WAY THAT WOULD INFORM US AS A PROPERTY OWNER -- WHERE SHOULD WE SHOULD INVEST OUR MONIES? SO FACILITY CONDITION INDEX OR FCI IS A SORT OF A STANDARD A METRIC USED BY COMMERCIAL -- OPERATORS INDUSTRIAL OPERATORS EXCEPT TRUCK. TO PUT A PEN IN AND I'M AN AMOUNT TO AN IN A CONDITION. OF YOUR YOUR FACILITY AND IT HAS RANGES FROM. POOR TO FAIR GOOD EXCELLENT AND TYPICALLY IT'S DRIVEN BY THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE PROPERTY. IN OUR CASE -- WE HAVE A LOT OF BUILDINGS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE A LOT OF BURIED INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS THAT ARE WITHIN THOSE WALLS THAT HAVE A SHORTER USEFUL LIFE. SO -- I THINK THAT MAYBE THAT WAS PERHAPS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY STRUGGLED WITH THIS UNDERSTANDING THAT. THEY ALSO STRUGGLED WITH SUBMITTING TO US PROJECTS THAT JUST BECAUSE THEY EXCEEDED THEIR USEFUL LIFE THEY PRESENTED THEM AS PROJECTS THAT WE SHOULD PROCEED WITH. BUT WE WE WANTED TO TAKE A DEEPER DIVE IN THAT AND LOOK AT JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS IT EXCEEDED IS YOU ITS USEFUL LIFE. IS IT INDEED OPERATING IN A DECENT CONDITION CAN WE RELIABLY COUNT ON THAT PARTICULAR FACILITY OR SYSTEM TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN THAT FASHION. AND SO WE'VE. LOOKED AT REDUCING SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT THEY BELIEVE WERE NECESSARY SIMPLY BECAUSE A LIFE AND IT'S JUST A NUMBER. YOU KNOW IT SOME OF OUR FACILITIES OUR SERVER OLDER FACILITIES LOOK -- ACTUALLY BETTER THAN SOME OF OUR NEWER OFFICES. SO IT'S A NUMBER BUT IT'S IT'S A IT'S A GUIDE IF YOU WELL IT'S NOT A HARD AND FAST -- NUMBER TWO FOR US TO REALIZE. WHAT WHAT'S TYPICAL USEFUL LIFE FOR THE EXTERIOR AND AN INTERNET FOR FIFTY TO FIFTY FIVE YEARS FOR AN END TO WHAT THEY CALL INDUSTRIAL GRADE BUILDING IF IF IT WAS A TYPICAL OFFICE BUILDING YOU'RE IN THE THIRTY YEAR RANGE? BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS WE AS AS ASSET OWNERS DON'T DEMOLISH A THIRTY YEAR OLD BUILDING. YOU KNOW WE FIGURE OUT HOW -- TO CAN BECAUSE THE STRUCTURES YOU KNOW ARE ARE FAIRLY -- IN FAIRLY GOOD SHAPE IT'S THE SYSTEMS THAT FEED INTO IT THAT. THAT REALLY START TO SUFFER AGE SEE SAID FIFTY TO FIFTY FIVE YEARS FOR THE EXTERIOR. WHAT ABOUT THE INTERIOR -- WELL WERE UNIQUE IN THAT WE TEND TO SUFFER -- EXTREME WEAR AND TEAR. ALMOST ABUSE IF YOU WILL -- AND SO WHERE IT'S THE WHERE IT'S AN AREA THAT HAS A LOT OF LOT OF SYSTEMS THAT ARE TOUCHABLE LIKE KITCHENS -- THOSE TEND TO HAVE A LOT MORE WEAR AND TEAR. WE HAVE PRETTY STURDY STRUCTURE SO A LOT OF CONCRETE WALLS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO MUCH DAMAGE TO THE GIVES YOUR ESTIMATE FORMER [inaudible] I'M. I WOULD SAY IT'S PROBABLY IN THE SAME VEIN THE INTERIOR STRUCTURES. ARE IN THE SAME VEIN SYSTEMS ARE MORE IN THE TWENTY TO THIRTY THIRTY YEAR RANGE. LIKE WATER SYSTEMS YEAH OUR SYSTEM YEAH. THE SOUL ON THIS REPORT WAS BE COMPLETED FALL OF EIGHTEEN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN NOW WOULD NOT THE DATE IS. JUNE TWENTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY NO NO NO NO IT IT WE'RE STILL PLANNING ISSUE YEAH WE STILL WANTED DOING THINGS HERE IT IS A REASON WHY CAN'T BE DONE BEFORE THE FOR THE BUDGET PROCESS IS COMPLETED. YEAH I THINK WE WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK AT THAT -- YOU KNOW I I WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S A DOCUMENT THAT WE ARE CONFIDENT -- DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF OF IS THAT THAT HAVEN'T BEEN ADDRESSED IT I THINK WE'RE CLOSE ON THE RIDGE. WE USE THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL FACILITY AS IT AS A TEMPLATE A FORMAT IF YOU WILL SO LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW TO WRITE IT UP FOR ONE FACILITY. AND THEN MOVE FORWARD -- AND USE THAT SAME FORMATFOR THE OTHERS IN HINDSIGHT THAT WAS PROBABLY NOT THE BEST CHOICE BECAUSE IT'S SO COMPLEX AS A MAJOR REASON WHY THEY CAN'T BE DONE BEFORE MAY FIFTEENTH. I'M OR WHAT IS THE REASON I CAN'T GET THEM FROM THE TWELVE SO REMEMBER SO THEY ARE BEING PRODUCED IN INDIVIDUAL CHAPTERS TO EACH PERSON HAS ITS OWN CHAPTER. CALIFORNIA MEDICAL FACILITY IS CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW BY THE EXECUTIVE BODY SO THAT'S THE FEDERAL RECEIVER'S OFFICE AND THE UNDERSECRETARIES AND THE DIRECTORS -- TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THEIR MISSION AND THEIR GOALS. FOR THE ASSET. I'M IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE CMS SO THAT YOU CAN GET A FLAVOR FOR WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO CIRCULATE THE EARLIER I'D HAVE TO CHECK WITH STAFF TO MAKE SURE. BUT THEN EACH ONE THAT FOLLOWS IS IS FOLLOWING ON A FASTER PATH BECAUSE THE FORMAT WAS REALLY THE STRUGGLE TO GET THAT SO SURE THAT MAKES SENSE. IT NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED IN A FORMAT THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHO'S NOT A FACILITY PLANT PERSON CAN UNDERSTAND AND SO THAT'S BEEN OUR FEEDBACK TO IT. THE REPORT IT'S A VERY TECHNICAL SHE'S A LOT OF ABBREVIATIONS AND YOU'RE TRYING TO WHAT WAS THAT AGAIN YOU'RE GOING BACK AND LOOKING FOR IT SO IF THAT WAS ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS GOING FORWARD IS. TO HAVE IT WRITTEN IN A FASHION THAT THIS PERSON COULD UNDERSTAND IT. THIS SALUTE THE SUPPORT HOW DO YOU DEVELOP YOUR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PRIORITIES. WHEN YOU HAVE AND FINISH THIS REPORT BECAUSE THERE AREN'T REQUEST THE COMMAND? THAT WERE BEING ASKED TO FUND SO I THINK OUR OUR CHALLENGES IS. WITHOUT A LIST OF PRIORITIES OR WITHOUT A METHODOLOGY. THE REQUEST KEEP COMING IN THAT THERE'S NO OVERALL STUDIES SO HOW WOULD YOU WHAT. WHY WOULD WHY WOULD WE OR WHY SHOULD WE -- INVEST MONEY WITHOUT THIS REPORT BEING DONE. I CAN APPRECIATE THE HESITATION THE CONCERN -- WE ARE I'M NOT SURE WHEN YOU JOINED IN MY EARLIER CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE PRIORITIZE AND AND IT'SACTUALLY VERY CONSISTENT WITH THE TENANTS OF OF THE PENAL CODE. TWENTY SIXTY SEVEN I'M. IT IT'S OUR BELIEF THAT THE PROJECTS THAT WERE SUBMITTING. TODAY THE CAPITAL PROJECTS IN THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS ARE ALL CRITICAL PROJECTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY NO IN SIN CAFFEINE'S HERE TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THE IMPACTS. ON THESE THESE PROJECTS HAVE ON HER -- OPERATING CONDITIONS THERE ISN'T A PROJECT THAT WE'RE SUBMITTING HERE TODAY THAT. IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WOULDN'T CONSIDER -- FOR THE TWELVE PRISONS IN FACT IN LOOKING AT THE FEW -- THAT I'VE READ SO FAR -- A NUMBER OF THE PROJECTS ARE ALREADY IN THE THE TOLD PRISON CITY SO THEY'RE IDENTIFIED THE SAME THING WE'RE IDENTIFYING -- AT AND YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY REGRETS FOR MAKING THESE REQUESTS AND IN TURN MAKING HIS INVESTMENTS AND I CAN SAY I HAVE NO REGRETS BECAUSE THEY SEE THESE CONDITIONS I SEE THE IMPACT TO THE TO THE PRISONS IF WE WAIT. ANY LONGER -- THE WAY CONSTRUCTION COSTS WERE THE PRICES SIMPLY GO OUT. SO I I THINK THAT THE PROJECTS WERE SUBMITTING HERE TODAY ARE NOT PROJECTS THAT WE WOULDN'T -- WE WILL WE BELIEVE OUR WOULDN'T BE NECESSARY IN THIS TWELVE PERSON STUDY -- I MEAN I'M I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT IN SAYING THAT HERE TODAY BUT KNOWING THAT WE HAVE FINING POPULATION I I CAN APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN AND WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE MAKING INVESTMENTS IN THE RIGHT FACILITIES -- GOING FORWARD. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT -- THE REPORT WILL HIGHLIGHT BUT IT'S OBVIOUS WE HAVE LEAKING ROOFS INTO CELLS AND TODAY ROOMS AND CLASSROOMS I HAVE TO WE HAVE TO SHUT DOWN CLASSROOMS ON A REGULAR BASIS. WE HAVE WE HAVE ONE INSTITUTION THAT'S BEEN DOWN FROM THIS TWO YEARS. SO YOU'RE NOT PROVIDING AN ADEQUATE EDUCATION. NOW WITH FIFTY SEVEN THAT QUIT CELEBRITY AND SO TO HE SIGNIFICANT CONCERN YEAH WE WE WE AGREE WE SHARE THE SAME CONCERN AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE HERE. LAST YEAR SELECT GROUNDHOG DAY AGAIN I MEAN SECRETARY KERN AND CAME BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AND YOU KNOW I HAD REQUESTED. A REPORT A PRIORITIZATION OF ALL THE DIFFERENT FACILITIES -- A YEAR LATER WE STILL HAVEN'T. SO -- THAT WAS FOR THE CONDITION UPON US DOING APPROPRIATIONS. SO. THE WORDS TRUST US IT DOESN'T. IT'S NOT ENOUGH. RIGHT I MEAN YOU'RE NOT ASKING FOR LUNCH MONEY RIGHT NOW YOU'RE ASKING FOR YOU KNOW ALMOST A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE COSTS WHEN. WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT IT'S NOT CRITICAL BUT THE THE THE THING IN BUDGET COMMITTEES EVERYTHING'S CRITICAL. IF YOU GO TO A YOU KNOW RIGHT RIGHT NEXT DOOR IS ALL THE HOMELESS AS A MENTAL HEALTH -- DISCUSSION THAT'S CRITICAL SO EVERYTHING IS ACTUALLY CRITICAL SO. WE HAVE. TO DO A JOB SCHERING THAT OUR MONEY IS REALLY FAST SPENT. INTO SAYING HEY TRUST US. THE REPORTS NOT DONE. EVERYTHING'S OKAY. WE JUST NEED THE MONEY BECAUSE IT'S CRITICAL. THAT TO SOME OF THE PASS MUSTER SO I THINK -- AGAIN I THINK WHAT YOU'VE PRESENTED TODAY -- DOESN'T FILLED THE REQUEST I MADE A YEAR AGO -- DURING SUCH TIME THAT. THE REQUEST WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FOR FELT THAT SHOULD AND COMMUNICATED TO MY OFFICE TO THIS COMMITTEE IT WASN'T. SO -- INTEL THE DEPARTMENT CAN BRING FORWARD A BROADER PLAN. A BROADER VISION. OF WHERE THEY WANT TO SPEND THE MONEY. AND WHAT ARE THE PRIORITIES FOR SAYS HEY HERE'S YOU KNOW THE BRUCE LEE CUSTOM WE NEED MONEY. THAT'S THAT'S NOT AN ADEQUATE -- ANSWER IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BUDGET. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THINGS MUCH MORE GLOBAL THE AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THINGS MORE LONG TERM. SO -- AGAIN. THE REQUESTED STILL STANDING FROM TWELVE MONTHS AGO THIS WASN'T A NEW WASN'T. LAST WEEK OR TWO WEEKS AGO THIS IS. A YEAR AGO SECRETARY PROMISED THAT THEY WOULD GET THIS DONE AHEAD FALL CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM IN HIS TEAM. TO THIS DAY HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANYTHING. SO IT COULD HAVE BEEN LOST IN EMAIL OR MAYBE WENT TO SPAM -- SO IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN. HAPPY TO YOU KNOW IT'S ON ME. HOW? HOW THE COMMITTEE CAN EVALUATE? THESE PROPOSALS BECAUSE OF THE DEPARTMENTS [inaudible] TRACK RECORD. AN IMPLEMENT IMPLEMENTATION AND THE DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT'S LACK OF VISION. AND FRANKLY LIKE PLAN. SO IF IF THE YOU KNOW THE THE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T FOR PHIL I REQUEST IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US. TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THESE THINGS. IT'S A FAIR ENOUGH AND YOU KNOW I CONSIDER MYSELF AN ADVOCATE -- FOR ALL THE OPERATIONS THAT EXIST IN THE PRISON. AND I DON'T WANT THE FAILURE OF MY ABILITY TO COMPLETE THIS REPORT TIMING TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT -- THE CONDITIONS THAT EXIST OUT THERE SO I'M GONNA DOUBLE BACK WITH STAFF TO SEE WHAT THINGS. MIGHT BE ABLE TO BE SHARED -- PERHAPS EVEN ON A FLOW BASIS -- THAT COULD HELP GET YOU MORE COME DO INDEED HAVE A PLANNING PROCESS. SO I THINK JUST RESTATE I THINK WHAT. WHAT AT LEAST I'M NOT JUST SPEAKING FOR MYSELF? WHAT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR IS? A LIST OF A LIST OF PRIORITIES. BY THE THIRTY FOUR FACILITIES WHICH YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE AMOUNT OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND YOU TO THESE FACILITIES RIGHT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT'S CALM AS ALWAYS FIX THIS ROOF BUT REALLY THERE'S ALL THIS STUFF DOWN THE ROAD HERE. SO SO THIS MAY BE TO THE EMERGENCY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WHAT'S THE TOTAL DEPARTMENT. BECAUSE WE WERE IN CHARGE OF MAKING SURE WE'RE MAKING THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS NOT JUST. MAKING SURE THE ROOF IS FIXED. SO. WHAT'S YOU KNOW WHAT THE TOTAL COST FOR ALL THREE FOUR BUT THE PRIORITY FOR ALL THIRTY FOUR WHAT IS. THE A PRIORITY OF THE DEPARTMENT BASED ON BASED ON YOUR VIEW IN IRAQ AND WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT ASKING. FOR YOU KNOW. FOR YOU TO AGREE WITH THE POWER LESS I DON'T HAVE A PART OF THIS I'M REALLY LOOKING FOR WHAT IS YOUR PRIORITY LIST SO THAT WE CAN. EVALUATE IT BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE PRESENTING TO US BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF YOU PLAY IF YOU ASKING FOR YOU KNOW -- MONEY TO DO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FOR TEN FACILITIES BUT THE OTHER ONES ARE BIGGER PARTIES OR THAT BIGGER. PRICE TAG SO OFTEN. IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY WE'RE DOING THIS RIGHT SO BUT WE CAN'T WE DON'T HAVE THAT. SO -- AGAIN REALLY REALLY -- HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE ONGOING. DISCUSSION I DON'T THINK THIS NEEDS TO BE THE END OF THE DISCUSSION THIS YEAR I THINK WE CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS. AND TO CONTINUE TO REFINE THAT BUT THERE IS SOME OF WHAT. THERE'S A LOT OF LOOPHOLES HERE. BECAUSE THAT OTHERWISETHEN WE MIGHT AS WELL. JUST FLIP THE POINT THAT WE CAN JUST KIND OF RANDOMLY SELECT. WORK IS FINDING WHAT DOESN'T BUT THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A VERY JUDICIOUS APPROACH [inaudible] TO FUNDING. SO THE EASIER APPROACH WOULD JUST BE TO NOT FIND ANY OF IT. AND TO SAY WELL WHEN YOU'RE READY TO PRESENT. THE INFORMATION IN A FASHION THAT -- YOU KNOW IS IS UNDERSTANDABLE THEN WE COULD. MOVE FORWARD BUT THESE ARE FAIRLY THE DECK NOT NONE OF THESE ARE SMALL NUMBERS THESE ARE NOT LIKE FIFTY THOUSAND OR TEN THOUSAND THESE ARE ALL VERY. SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY WITH NOT A LOT OF OVERALL BACK. I WILL SAY THAT OUR DETERIORATION OF OUR PHYSICAL PLANT WITHIN OUR PRISONS THE CERTAINLY BEEN. USE OF GREAT CONCERN FOR THOSE WHO TRYING TO MANAGE -- THESE FACILITIES WITH PLASTIC BAGS DEFERRED IN WATER TO A TRASH CAN. AND DEALING WITH FIRES THAT FAR. FAILED AND THE FIRE MARSHAL. SHUT US DOWN FROM OPERATING -- SO WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE PLAN ON HOW TO PREPARE FOOD WHICH COSTS EVEN MORE MONEY. THAN IT WOULD IN A REGULAR KITCHEN SO ALL OF IT IT'S IT'S VERY VERY COMPLEX AND AND IT CERTAINLY -- NOT LOST ON US OF HOW EXTREME THE PROBLEM IS -- AND OF COURSE THERE WAS THE EXPERT HERE AS FAR AS THE ACTUAL COST OF ALL OF THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BEEN TOTALED UP THESE WERE THE PRIORITY FOR THIS YEAR BASED ON BASED ON WHAT WE AND I THINK IT CAME FROM A LIST WE DO HAVE LISTS OF BILLIONS DOLLARS. WORTH OF PROJECTS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE OF THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE. THAT'S A LETTER ASKING FOR THEM NO I I MEAN THAT'S THE MAIN. I'M NOT ASKING FOR IT YOU KNOW THOUSAND LINES STRETCHED OUT THOUGH I MEAN I'M I LIKE THAT THAT MY TRUCK MY COLLEAGUES CRAZY -- SO WOULD NOT DOTHAT TO THEM BUT I MEAN. WHAT I MEAN WHEN YOU DEVELOP THESE PRIORITIES HOW HOW DO YOU DO AND YOU MUST HAVE A PROCESS FOR DOING IT AND? SAY HEY DID THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO THE TOP AND SO IF THERE'S A METHODOLOGY. LET US KNOW WHAT IT IS IN A WE'RE NOT ME AGAIN WHAT I'M ASKING YOU. TO I I I BELIEVE I THINK YOU WERE ASKING FOR A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW YOU GOT TO WHERE YOU'RE GOING AND THEN ALSO WHERE YOU'RE GOING. IT'S FOR AND THAT'S NOT AND THAT'S MISSING ALL ALL WE'RE SAYING IS THE FINAL. RESULT I THINK YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO SHOW THE COMMITTEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE BLACK BOX. BECAUSE THEN WE GET TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE AGREE WITH THAT. DECISION MAKE IT OR NOT. SO. AGAIN THE HOPE IS THAT WE CAN KEEP YOU KNOW WORK TOGETHER RIGHT RIGHT. RIGHT I KNOW IT'S KIND OF INCOME IN THE BUILDING. THE TO WORK TOGETHER AND TRY TO AGAIN COME TO SOME SORT OF RESOLUTION BEFORE. YOU KNOW BEFORE ME. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YES MISTER JONES SAWYER AND OUT TO MAKE A BRIEF OF IT PROFIT TO SO WILL HELP-- YOU GET THERE -- IN MY PREVIOUS LIFE I WAS DIRECTOR REAL ESTATE FOR THE CITY OF LA. AND I DEALT WITH DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OF FOUR THOUSAND CITY BUILDING FROM CITY HALL THE RE DOWN TO AN OUTHOUSE. AND IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT OFFICIALS NOW. THAT YOU NEED MONEY FOR SOMETHING OTHER WE CAN'T SEE OR DON'T UNDERSTAND. OR WE DON'T MAKE CLEAR TIMES A LOT OF TIMES I DID MAKE CLEAR THE URGENCY. OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A LEAKY ROOF. WELL. CAUSE DAMAGE TO COMPUTERS WASTING CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE FLOOR WHICH THEN CAUSES WATER DAMAGE DUE TO SPEAK SECOND FLOOR DOWN TO THE FIRST FLOOR. SOMETIMES YOU'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH THAT OR EVEN WHEN YOU DO YOUR CALCULATIONS I HAVE A RULE OF THUMB THAT WHENEVER I SEE NUMBERS. WITH THE FIVE A MORE ZEROS. I DON'T THINK THERE'S A REAL NUMBERS THOSE ARE MADE UP NUMBERS DOES A SWAG IS JUST. AND JUST AS SOME ZEROS TO IT. GET IN ABOUT AROUND ABOUT. NUMBER WHAT GENERALLY HAPPENS IS YOU START A PROJECT AND THEN YOU BACK IN HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE ASKING FOR MORE MONEY BECAUSE YOU DID ASK FOR ENOUGH. OR WASN'T SPECIFIC ENOUGH TO GET IT DOWN. SO THAT YOU -- ACTUALLY NEW. WHAT YOU NEED TO TAKE TO GET THAT NUMBER AND SOMETIMES WE GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN A BONELESS PRIVATE SECTORS? NUMBER AND GOVERNMENT NUMBERS OF OR NOT. FOR A LOT MORE AS MUCH WE GET WERE RETICENT AND PUTTING IN A BIGGER NUMBER. ALL WE REALLY NEED A BIGGER NUMBER SO I WANT TO OFFER THE SAME SET I'M PROBABLY THE ONE I WANT TO GET INTO MINUTIA BECAUSE I ALSO AND MAKE SURE IT GETS DONE. AT THE END OF THE DAY. IF WE WERE TO GIVE YOU THIS MONEY AND SOME OF US ARE HERE FOR ANOTHER HOPEFULLY SIX MMHM MORE YEARS WE DON'T WANNA BE HERE FOUR YEARS FROM NOW AND YOU'RE IN HERE SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT. WE CAN GET THIS DONE WE NEED ANOTHER TWO MILLION ANOTHER ONE MILLION OTHER. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HERE. FOR THE BUDGET CHAIR. I'VE ASKED FOR THINGS AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE BEING PUT OFF WHAT WHICH WEALTHIER MEMBERS YOU CAN'T DO THAT HE USED TO DO IT NOT YOU DID IT IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT THE WAY THEY USED TO DO WITH. SIX YEAR MEMBERS WE ACTUALLY ARE LISTENING ACTUALLY WANT TO KNOW SO. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW YOU CAME UP WITH THE ESTIMATES IF IT'S A PRIVATE SECTOR. ESTIMATOR PRESIDENT TERM BECAUSE WHEN YOU HANDED OFF THE WORK TO YOUR IN. AN INTERNAL AS OPPOSED TO AN OUTSIDE CONTRACTOR. YOU CAN GET. VARYING DEGREES OF NUMBERS AND IN RUGBY OUT QUITE HONEST WITH YOU -- PROFESSIONALISM AND GETTING THE JOB DONE AND GET A JOB JOB DONE RIGHT. IN PRISONS WE DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF MAKING A MISTAKE OR NOT GETTING IT CORRECT. AND SO I WOULD. WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ON TRYING. TO PUT THIS BOIL THIS DOWN SO THAT. SADDAM VALLEY THAT I UNDERSTAND WHY. THIS IS NEEDED NOT ONLY TO PRIORITIZE IT BUT ALSO TO GIVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING. TO ANYONE I READ THESE REPORTS THAT -- DELI DEBT IS NECESSARY BUT THIS IS WHY DISNEY'S GO FIRST SECOND THIRD FOURTH I'M I'M ALSO OFFERING -- DE TO HELP WITH THAT. THANK YOU -- I'M GLAD YOU UNDERSTAND SO THINGS IN PART OF YOUR DESCRIPTION IS EXACTLY WHY WE'RE STILL STRUGGLING TO GET THIS CONSULTANT SUPPORT -- TO BE REALISTIC REPORT WE DID WE WANTED AN OUTSIDE CONSULTORES THAT IS IT IS OR NOT -- YOU HIGHER THAN THE GENERAL SERVICES ENGINEER HIRE THEM I MEAN I WE WANT TO GET WE HAD A YEAH. THE COMPETITIVE PROCESS WE WE PICK SOMEONE THAT HAD FAMILIAR WITH OUR PRISONS WE PICKED AN ARCHITECTURAL FIRM THAT WOULD HELP SERVE THEM IN THEIR CAPACITY AS THE CONSULTANT THAT ALSO HAD FAMILIARITY. BUT THAT DIDN'T. UNFORTUNATE DIDN'T YIELD A PRODUCT THAT WE FELT THAT IT BENEFITTED FROM THE WISDOM OF ALL THE YEARS SERVING US -- AND SO WE ENDED UP WITH PROJECTS THAT. FRANKLY I DON'T THINK I COME BEFORE YOU TWO YEARS FROM NOW AND AND ASKED FOR A FUNDING FOR ONE A COUPLE OF THESE PROJECTS THAT ARE IN THIS REPORT. BECAUSE THEY JUST WEREN'T THOUGHT THROUGH. I WANTED THINGS WE DID WILL BE A BUILDING POLICE STATION FIRE STATIONS LIBRARIES -- WE STOP IN THIS IS NO SLIGHT CLUB I'M SORRY I'M LATE I GOT HERE SO I DON'T KNOW YOUR PROFESSIONAL. EXPERTISE BUT WE STOP HAVING A POLICE STATION. BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE AN OFFICE THE SIZES ROOM. OFFICE AND THEN YOU HAVE POLICE OFFICERS IN LITTLE BITTY CUBBY HOLES AND YOU GO TO ANOTHER ONE HE DOUBLE SMALL OFFICE AND BIG GIGANTIC SERGEANTS DESK. SO. WE HAD TO HAVE SOME CONFORMITY ALONG. THE SLIME BUT WE ALSO LEARNED THAT WHEN YOU GIVE IT -- TO TO STRUCTURE AND USE OF ENGINEERS IN THE DAY WILL DRILL DOWN AND MAKE SURE -- YOU GET IT DONE ON TIME AND ON BUDGET CA THAT'S THAT'S REALLY KIND OF MY CONCERN. THAT WHATEVER WE DO WE GET IT DONE ON TIME ABOUT. MY LOOK FOR IT HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH ME ON OKAY THANK YOU -- ONE QUICK QUESTION ARE WE STILL WE STILL USING THE SAME CONSULTANT THAT DELAYED -- YES -- YOU KNOW THEY WERE SO DEEP INTO IT AND AND REALLY SO MUCH OF THE WORK THAT WAS NECESSARY TO PERFORM THIS TO PUT TOGETHER SUPPORT WAS IN THE GATHERING AND THE INTERPRETING OF DATA. IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE TO SWITCH THEM OUT AT THAT POINT BUT WE ARE HANDS ON WITH THIS CONSUMER SPENDING AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF TIME. TO GET THEM TO PRODUCE A REPORT -- THAT MAKES SENSE FOR US CAN WORK WE HAVE AN INCREASE THE BUDGET FOR THE CONSULTANT NOW AND WE MADE IT CLEAR TO THEM THAT THEY YOU KNOW THE SKIT WE HAVE NOT CHANGED THE SCOPE -- AND WE MADE CLEAR TO THEM THAT WE EXPECT THAT THEY PROVIDE PROVIDE ALL OF THE DELIVERABLES THAT WE ASK FOR IN THAT SCOPE AND THE MONEY IS OF THE MONEY THAT WE AGREED UPON WHEN WE SIGNED THE CONTRACT. I WE CALCULATE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE'VE SPENT ON IT THAT WE NORMALLY WOULD NOT OF SPENT ON IT IF IT HADN'T BEEN DONE CORRECTLY. NO YOU KNOW BUT I TELL YOU I'VE NEVER CENTER SO WHICH AND WE'D EXPECTED SIMPLY BECAUSE THE STAFF.

ALL OF THOSE OUT ON A FOR VOTE WILL HOLD IT OPEN -- FOR MELENDEZ TO VOTE IF SHE COMES BEFORE THE END OF THE MEETING OUR THAT BRINGS US NOW TO THE SECOND ITEM FOR DISCUSSION. WHICH IS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OVERVIEW DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BUDGET PROPOSAL AND PRISON MAINTENANCE FUNDING METHODOLOGY BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT IS CORRECT THE ISSUE REALLY INVOLVES TWO SEPARATE BUDGET REQUESTS TO A REQUEST FOR A ONE TIME INCREASE OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR SPECIAL PAIRS AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS. ARE FOR PROJECTS AROUND THE STATE AT OUR FACILITIES. THE SECOND REQUEST IS EIGHTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND IN NINETEEN TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN POINT ONE MILLION IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND FIFTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION ON MAINTENANCE FUNDING. AND AS PART OF THE PROPOSAL WERE ASKING TO REPLACE OUR EXISTING METHODOLOGY WHICH IS BASED ON A PER PRISONER BASIS. TWO ONE THAT IS BASED ON SQUARE FOOTAGE FOR MAINTENANCE. AGAIN WE HAVE THE SAME PANELISTS FROM THE FIRST ISSUE ON THIS BUT WE'LL KEEP IT BRIEF THANK YOU -- SO AGAIN -- THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS WE DEVELOPED FOR THE CAP ALLEY IS IDENTICAL TO THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. EXCEPT THAT IT'S FOCUSES MORE ACUTELY ON EXISTING CONDITIONS -- THAT HAVE BEEN DEFERRED BECAUSE OF LACK OF FUNDING ACCENTURE. I'M THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVES TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR FOR ITS ADULT FACILITIES AND TWO MILLION FOR ITS JUVENILE FACILITIES TO ADDRESS THESE KINDS OF ISSUES -- WE HAVE SEEN A BACKLOG OF OUR REPAIR PROJECTS GROW STARTING FROM WHEN WE FIRST STARTED MEASURING IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT R. FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN SCOPE TO PROJECTS -- AND THAT'S IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE BELIEVE IS A GREATER BACKLOG THAT WE'VE REPORTED RECENTLY IN THE MASTER PLAN. AS MUCH AS THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE TWO IS THAT THE MILLION DOLLARS IS THOSE PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME FOCUSED ON GETTING SCOPE AND COST ESTIMATES. I'M AND SO THIS BACKLOG HAS GROWN AND WHAT WHAT IT AS BECAUSE IN THE PRISONS. IS -- SORT OF THIS BREAK FIX RUN TO FAIL -- ROACH WHERE ARE OUR PRISONS ARE TRYING TO FIX THE THINGS THAT ARE BREAKING THAT DAY AND ARE NOT BEING STRATEGIC IN SPENDING TIME IN PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE BECAUSE ARE BEING -- RELOCATED -- TO THINGS THAT ARE BREAKING DOWN -- AROUND THEM. AND I'M CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE THAT THE RESOURCES -- WITHIN THE TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR NUMBER TO ADEQUATELY TRYING TO INTERVENE IN THAT BREAK SITE BREAK FIX CYCLE -- AND SO THIS REQUEST IN FRONT OF YOU THIS TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR QUEST FOR TEN PROJECTS. IS -- IN OUR MIND SOME OF THE WORST MOST IMMEDIATE -- CONDITIONS THAT THREATEN THE SAVE. OUR SECURE AND EFFECTIVE OPERATION OF THE PRISONS -- EARLIER JONES SAWYER -- MENTIONED THAT -- YOU HAVE A ROOF LEAK IT HAS A COLLATERAL IMPACT AND INDEED IT DOES AND YOU'LL SEE IN THE PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ROOFS AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF FLOORS -- THAT ARE FAILING AND THE FLOORS ARE FAMILY BECAUSE WATER INTRUSION -- IT'S CAUSING A GREAT DEAL OF CALAMITY AND THE PRISONS -- IT'S CAUSING US TO HAVE TO SHUT DOWN PROGRAM MOVE INMATES -- FROM HOUSING UNITS FROM MEDICAL BADS AND SO PART OF THE REQUEST HERE IS TO REPLACE SOME ROUGH SAID A FEW OF OUR FACILITIES -- AND ALSO TO REPLACE SOME FLOORING AT SOME OF THE IMPACTED AREAS -- WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS IDENTIFIES? SIX LIKE THAT THAT WE FELT WE ABSOLUTELY HAD TO GET -- WORKING ON FOR THE VALUE OF THE PRISON. SYSTEM TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY -- WE ALSO HAVE -- SOME REGULATORY ISSUES ON IN HERE -- WE HAVE SOME. OF UPON IMPROVEMENTS AT ONE OF OUR PRISONS WE'VE GOT -- A KITCHEN FIRE SUPPRESSION IT'S REQUIRED AS PART OF A CODE AND BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE FIRE SUPPRESSION THE KITCHENS -- THE FARMERS WILL HAVE SHUT DOWN THE KITCHEN OPERATIONS AT ONE OF OUR FACILITIES AND SO THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE DO WITH US SO LIKE KITCHENS. COOKING SO LIKE KITCHENS. SO THE IMPACT OF THAT IS -- THE INCREASED COST OF FOOD PREPARATION -- AND THE WAY THAT WE HAVE TO PURCHASE FOOD INSTEAD OF LARGE QUANTITY SMALLER SYSTEM -- PRE PACKAGED ITEMS THINGS LIKE THAT SO IT HAS SAID IT SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. TO US WHEN THE FIRE MARSHAL COMES IT DOWN AND SHUTS DOWN YOU KNOW FIVE OF YOUR SATELLITE KITCHENS. AND YOU ONLY HAVE YOUR YOUR MAIN KITCHEN DO TO PREPARE FOOD AND TO RE HEAT AND GET IT. OVER TO THE FACILITIES FOR SERVING YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT AT CERTAIN TEMPERATURES SO IT'S BEEN VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR US AND WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THOSE ISSUES BUT WE HAVE TO GET THE FIRE SUPPRESSION SYSTEM. SO WE HAVE FIRE SUPPRESSION SYSTEM FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS WHICH ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT -- AND THE FACT THAT WITHOUT A PROPER FIRE ALARM SYSTEM ON A BUILDING I HAVE TO HAVE STAFF. AVAILABLE TO ON A WHAT WE CALL FIRE WATCH SO WE'RE STILL WE'RE PAYING ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR FIRE WATCH VERSES IN ALARM SYSTEM WHO SHOULD ALERT US. TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO AN AREA SO MULTIPLE FISH. REALLY SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL PLANT CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE SOME OF THESE BAD SAID -- DOUBLES TALKING ABOUT OUR LICENSE MEDICAL BENEFITS. AND YOU KNOW THE FEAR IS IS YOU KNOW IMPACT IN OUR LICENSURE IN OUR ABILITY TO CARE FOR THE PATIENTS WITHIN THE FACILITY VERSUS HAVING TO TRANSFER THEM OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY. HOSPITALS. ANOTHER AREA OF SIGNIFICANT CONCERN SOME OF THESE ARE ARE. LARGE YOU KNOW I I KNOW MORE ABOUT PHYSICAL PLANT DESIGN THAN I CARE TO BECAUSE I'M NOT NOT THAT GIRL BUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A WHOLE. THIS LARGE IN A PIPE THAT THAT IS DOING YOUR HEATING AND COOLING FOR YOUR INSTITUTION AND IT'S YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY GALLONS A MINUTE OF WATER LOSS THAT WE HAVE. IT IT YOU KNOW IT CERTAINLY IMPACT X. ONE SECTION OF PIPE. YOU KNOW TEN FEET DOWN THE ROAD THE PIPE IS BREAKING YET AGAIN BECAUSE HE'S GO THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE INSTITUTION. THAT UNDER GROUND A PHYSICAL PLANT THAT IT WAS TALKING ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS THAT IS PROBLEMATIC. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS IN YEARS PAST -- AND MOST PARTICULARLY WITH THE REFER PLACEMENTS. AND IT'S REALLY MY HOPE THAT THIS BACKLOG WE START TO SEE IT -- DIMINISH OVER TIME BECAUSE WE'VE HAD THIS INTERSECTION OF PUTTING THE NECESSARY RESOURCES AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU CAN GET A WATER TIGHT ENVELOPE OF A STRUCTURE. YOU CAN START TO MAKE MEANINGFUL REPAIRS ON THE INTERIOR BUT IT YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO PUT -- ANY KIND OF INTERIORS -- REPAIRS IN PLACE AND THEN HAVE THE ROOF -- LEAGUE SUBSTANTIALLY AND THEN IT'S JUST DESTROYED ALL THAT WORK SO -- YOU KNOW GETTING THAT WATER TIGHT ENVELOPE IS IMPORTANT AND IN -- SO SO WE ARE HOPING THAT THE COMBINATION OF THIS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR HOUSE PLUS THE REGULAR. AMOUNT THAT WE RECEIVED AS PART OF SPECIAL PLAYER REPAIR. PLUS YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THE INCREASE TO THE FACILITY OPERATIONS FUNDING. WHICH WOULD. IN OUR MINDS PROPERLY RESOURCE THE TIONS PERSONNEL TO BE MORE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN SOME OF THIS -- PERIODIC MAINTENANCE TO OUR SYSTEMS THE COMBINATION OF ALL OF THAT WE HOPE -- WILL START TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THIS BACKLOG [inaudible] ANY QUESTIONS. ANY COMMENTS OF BURMA. FINANCE [inaudible] HELLO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AT WE WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE IT WITH A LIST OF SPECIFIC PROJECTS THAT WOULD LIKE TO UNDERTAKE WITH THE PROPOSED THE REQUESTED TWENTY FIVE MILLION. AS WELL AS AN EXPLANATION OF HOW IT PRIORITIZE THOSE PROJECTS THE DEPARTMENT HAS SINCE PROVIDED A LIST AND WHICH WE ARE REVIEWING% AND WILL CERTAINLY NOTIFY THE COMMITTEE IF. WE IDENTIFY ANY CONCERNS WITH THOSE PROJECTS -- IN ADDITION WE RECOMMEND TO REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE THINK WOULD HELP BETTER ENABLE LET A LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF ON GOING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ISSUES. AT THE FIRST IS -- REQUIRING THAT APARTMENT IDENTIFY HOW THEIR BACKLOG CHANGES BETWEEN TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE BACKLOG GROWS OVER THAT PERIOD REQUIRING CDC ARE TO IDENTIFY THE REASONS FOR THAT GROWTH AS WELL AS WHAT STRATEGIES IT'S TAKING TO MITIGATE THAT. I'M AND THEN SECOND REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO REPORT ON WHAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS ARE ULTIMATELY FUNDED WITH TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY FUNDS THANK YOU. NO THE COMMENTS IN OKAY THAT ITEM WILL BE HELD OPEN REMOVED TO THE FINAL ITEM WITH THIS ITEM NUMBER. THREE ISSUE THREE VARIOUS CAPITAL OUTLAY IN FACILITY IMPROVEMENT BUDGET PROPOSALS THANK YOU. THE FINAL ISSUE IS A LISTING OF OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY AND FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROPOSALS ARE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT FOR THIS ISSUE IS DEAN BORG HE'S THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF FACILITY PLANNING CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- DON'T GO AS QUICKLY AS I CAN OVER THESE -- PROJECTS I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE GONNA BE HELD OPEN -- THE FIRST OF SEVERAL PROJECTS LISTED THERE ARE A HEALTHCARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM PROJECTS AT FOR PRISONS -- LAST SURE APPROPRIATE FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL LEASE REVENUE FUNDING FOR THE HECK OF IT PROJECTS AND AT THAT TIME WE ANALYZED OUR EXISTING PROJECTS AND LOOK TO SEE WHICH PROJECTS WERE MOST AT RISK. FOR ADDITIONAL -- COST INCREASES AND WHAT WE IDENTIFIED AT THESE FOR PRISONS WERE OTHER REPORT PERFORMING GENERAL CONTRACTOR FOR PERFORMING A KNEE CONSULTANT AND OR RENOVATION PROJECTS AND BUILDINGS THAT WERE FIFTY FIVE TO SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD. AND OUR EXPERIENCE AT OTHER PRISONS THAT ALREADY TOLD US THAT WHEN YOU GET INTO THOSE BUILDINGS OF THAT AGE YOU FIND A LOT OF THINGS IN THE CEILING AND WALLS THAT YOU WEREN'T ANTICIPATING AND THEN WITH THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR OUT THERE. IT'S LEADING TO A LOT OF EXTENDED JOHN COSTS SO -- WE HAVE -- TAKEN THE PROJECTS OF THESE FOR PRISONS OUT OF THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR SCOPE AND PROPOSING FUNDING IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET TO DO THAT THROUGH THE IN MERRICK WARD LABOR PROGRAM -- CONSTRUCTION METHOD -- STARTING NEXT FISCAL YEAR -- WHEN WE DO RUN INTO PROBLEMS IN THERE ARE PROJECTS THE IN WHAT WE'RE LABOR PROBLEMS PRO PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE AN EXTENDED OVERHEAD CHARGE LIKE THE GENERAL CONTRACTORS DO AND THEY WORK MUCH CLOSER WITH THE PRISON IN ORDER TO KEEP EXISTING OPERATIONS GOING? WELL THEY'RE DOING THIS WORKS WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL HAVE A A LONG TERM BENEFIT TO HAVING THE LEAST REVENUE FUNDING APPROVED LAST YEAR AGO FARTHER AS FAR AS THE OTHER PROJECTS ARE CONCERNED -- MOVING ON FROM THAT HEALTHCARE PROJECT -- WE DO HAVE -- CONSTRUCTION -- PREPARATION REQUEST -- FOR NEW YARD FOR INMATES AT FACILITY DE I A PELICAN BAY STATE PRISON THAT WAS A FORMER SECURITY HOUSING UNIT THAT WAS CONVERTED TO LEVEL TWO INMATES -- THREE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE THEM WITH -- PROPER YARD -- SPACE OUTSIDE THE BUILDING -- FOR THEIR RECREATION -- THE NEXT PROJECT IS THAT -- CORRECTIONAL TRAINING FACILITY ON SOLEDAD -- THAT IS ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION CELL DOOR RETROFIT -- THIS IS THE LAST OF A SERIES OF FOR PROJECTS THAT HAS DONE THIS RETROFIT AT OTHER PRISONS THAT SIMILARLY HAD BARRED FRONTS FOR THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION -- DOORS -- THIS IS JUST BEING COMPLETED RIGHT NOW AT DUAL VOCATIONAL INSTITUTION DOWN TO TRACY AND IT'S A PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO IMPROVE -- SAFETY FOR BOTH THE INMATES IN THE STAFF THAT ARE WORKING AND LIVING IN THAT UNIT. THE NEXT PROJECT IS AT FOLSOM STATE PRISON -- IT'S NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO ADDITIONAL WATER STORAGE TANKS THAT WOULD SERVE BOTH FOLSOM STATE PRISON AND CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON SACRAMENTO -- THE THIS IS TO ADDRESS OUR FIRE SUPPRESSION REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE HIGHLIGHTED BY THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL DURING INSPECTIONS AND PROJECT REVIEWS OF OUR HEALTHCARE PROJECTS THAT WERE ON GOING OUT AT THOSE TWO PRISONS. THE NEXT PROJECT -- IS AT THE DAHLE LOCATIONAL INSTITUTION OR TRACY IT'S A NEW BOILER FACILITY OUR SYSTEM BOILERS DO NOT MEET OUR QUALITY STANDARDS SO THIS WILL -- CONSTRUCT -- SMALL BUILDING -- TO HOUSE OUR NEW BOILERS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BE IN -- COMPLIANCE WITH AIR QUALITY STANDARDS. THE NEXT OVER PROJECTS ARE ALL THOSE PRECEDING ONES I'VE MENTIONED WORK CONSTRUCTION OF CORPORATIONS IS NEXT GROUP ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR THE SECOND PHASE OF DESIGN FUNDING THE SO CALLED WORKING DRAWINGS FACE FUNDING FOR PROJECTS THAT WERE APPROVED. IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACT -- ONE OF THEM IS -- PROJECT THAT WOULD PROVIDE MEDICATION PREPARATION AND DISTRIBUTION IMPROVEMENTS AT THIRTEEN SEPARATE PRISONS -- TO DRESS MISSING CHANGES AND MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM EXPANSIONS -- ANOTHER PER PROJECT WOULD PROVIDE I'M FOR SPECIFIED HOUSING UNITS ARE HOUSING -- WHEN I'M OLDER PRISONS OF THE MEDICALLY A COMPROMISE?

SO -- OVER ABOUT THREE TO FIVE YEARS WILL BE IN A POSITION WHERE BLENDING WON'T EVEN MEET OUR STANDARDS ANY LONGER. SO WE HAVE -- REQUESTED ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TO BEGIN THE DESIGN PROCESS TO BUILD AN ARSENIC A TREATMENT PLANT -- FOR THE WATER THERE IT WOULD SERVE BOTH OF THOSE STRUCTURED.
