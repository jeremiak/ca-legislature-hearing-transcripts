THANK YOU FOR BEARING WITH US AS WE IMPLEMENT METHODS TO CONTINUE TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. WHILE ALSO BEING MINDFUL AND RESPECTFUL OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS THAT WE ALL FACE. WITH THOSE ANNOUNCEMENTS OUT OF THE WAY WE WILL MOVE ON OF THE COMMITTEE'S AGENDA. AS I MENTIONED ABOVE THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO CONSIDER GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S DOMINATION OF DOCTOR SHIRLEY WEBER. TO BE CALIFORNIA'S NEXT SECRETARY OF STATE. CALIFORNIA'S PREVIOUS SECRETARY OF STATE ALEX PADILLA. RESIGNED THAT POSITION EIGHT DAYS AGO WHEN HE WAS FORMALLY APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM TO REPRESENT CALIFORNIA IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. OUR NATION HAS JUST WHETHER A VERY DIFFICULT ELECTION YEAR THE BEGAN WITH THE PRIMARY IN MARCH JUST BEFORE WE FULLY APPRECIATED THE IMPACT OF CODED. AND CONCLUDED NOT AS WE EXPECTED IN NOVEMBER BUT JUST EARLIER THIS MONTH WHEN CONGRESS ACCEPTED THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. ONE OF THE MANY LESSONS LEARNED FROM THAT FROM TWENTY TWENTY IS THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A STRONG AND DEDICATED LEADER AS OUR SECRETARY OF STATE. JUST WEEKS AFTER THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY. WE WATCHED IN HORROR AS WISCONSINITES WERE FORCED TO VOTE IN PERSON IN THEIR PRIMARY ELECTION. STANDING FOR HOURS IN LINES THAT STRETCH FOR MILES WILL KOBE CASES WERE STEADILY CLIMBING. DESPITE THE BEST EFFORTS OF ELECTIONS OFFICIALS THOUSANDS OF VOTERS WHO REQUESTED ABSENTEE BALLOTS DID NOT RECEIVE THEM IN TIME TO VOTE AND RETURN THE BY ELECTION DAY. THEY WERE EFFECTIVELY DISENFRANCHISED. NOT ONLY DID OUR FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE MOVE SWIFTLY TO HELP US PREPARE FOR AN ELECTION DURING A ONCE IN A CENTURY PANDEMIC. AND AVOID THE PROBLEMS WE WITNESSED IN OTHER STATES. BUT HE ALSO OVERSAW AN ELECTION LIKE NO OTHER. WE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY WE MAIL THE BALLOT TO EVERY ACTIVE REGISTERED VOTER. IN THE STATE AND MAINTAINED IN PERSON VOTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE THAT NEEDED THAT OPTION. WITHOUT THE STEADY LEADERSHIP OUR SECRETARY OF STATE AND COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS WE COULD HAVE FACED MANY OF THE SAME CHALLENGES OF OTHER STATES. INSTEAD CALIFORNIA EMBRACED VOTING BY MAIL AND WE HAVE THE HIGHEST TURNOUT IN NEARLY SEVENTY YEARS. BUT THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST ELECTIONS AND ALL DEFERRED TO MY CO CHAIR TO DISCUSS THE VITAL ROLE WITH REGARD TO BUSINESS MATTERS. HOWEVER I WOULD BE NEGLIGENT NOT TO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS IN A POSITION TO STEP IN ON OTHER IMPORTANT MATTERS I SENATOR PEDIA DID IN HELPING TO LEAD OUR CENSUS EFFORTS. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK CLOSELY WITH SENATOR PER DO OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS ON BOTH ELECTIONS IN CENSUS EFFORTS. ONE OF THE THINGS I MOST APPRECIATED ABOUT HIM. WAS THIS COLLABORATIVE APPROACH. IN HIS VIEW IN THE LEGISLATURE AS A PARTNER IN THESE EFFORTS. NOT AS AN OBSTACLE OR KNOWING OBLIGATION. THIS PRODUCTIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP LED TO MUCH BETTER RESULTS FOR ALL FORTY ALL FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S WHAT MATTERS. I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH DR WEBBER OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS AS WELL. I KNOW WERE TO BE A STRONG VOICE FOR COMMUNITIES IN NEED A THOUGHTFUL LEADER ON THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES OF THE DAY. FROM EDUCATION TO ELECTIONS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. AND THE ONE PERSON THAT COMMANDS THE ATTENTION OF ALL COLLEAGUES WHEN SHE CHOOSES TO SPEAK ON THE FLOOR OF THE ASSEMBLY. CONFIRMING DR WEBBER WOULD BE A HUGE LOSS TO THE ASSEMBLY. BUT A MUCH GREATER WIN FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. ON A MORE PERSONAL NOTE MY STAFF MY STAFF HAS THE DEEPEST RESPECT AND ADMIRATION FOR DR WEBER. THEY'VE INFORMED ME THAT UPON DR MEMBERS DEPARTURE FROM THE ASSEMBLY FOR SOME OF THEM I WOULD FINALLY BE THEIR FAVORITE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT THE AG I GUESS. I'D LIKE TO TURN THINGS OVER TO MY COACH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER EVAN LOW TO MAKE ANY OPENER OPENING REMARKS THAT HE HAS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR OF WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. HAVE BEFORE IS THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE IN MISS WEBER. AS WELL AS MYSELF SERVING AS THE PAST CHAIR OF THAT COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE CURRENT YEAR. IN MR BERMAN A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY. LEADERSHIP THE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THIS S BY CAMEL BY CAMEL PROCESS AND REPRESENTING THE DIVERSITY. OF ALL OF US TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS A PROCESS TO WHICH WE CAN HELP EXPEDITE THE PROCESS TO EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS SMALL BUSINESSES. AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ALIKE- AND THE STEWARD OF PUBLIC TRUST AND- WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF SERVING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER. IN THIS CAPACITY. UNDER A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT WE'VE OUTLINED- THUS FAR TO POSE AS QUESTIONS AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOU AND YOUR TEAM TO HELP PROVIDE THAT. DETAIL BACKGROUND I LOOK FOR TO THE DIALOGUE THAT WE HAVE AHEAD OF US AND IN TURN THIS BACK TO. CULTURE MR BERMAN GREAT THANK YOU LOW. OVER NO I THINK BOTH OF YOUR REALLY STATED VERY WELL BUT I WANTED TO AT LEAST A LEAD DOCTOR NO HOW MUCH- I RESPECT HER AND HER LEADERSHIP OF THE KIND LEADERSHIP THAT ARE TO SEE AN END QUITE- TO KNOW WE TO HIT THE SWITCH INTO IT TO THE NEXT THE ISSUE IS NOT BEING A- TO SERVICE NOT ON OF YOU. THE HIGH LEVEL OF PROFESSIONAL THAT YOU'VE YOUR CELL AS LETTER- BUT ALSO COMMUNITY THAT FOLLOWS AND THAT YOU REPRESENT AND YOU HAVE NOT YIELDED FROM THE TOUGH ISSUES YOU STEPPED UP WHEN OTHERS WOULD NOT ARE YOU HAVE HAD TO TAKE YOUR SETBACKS BUT YOU PRESSED FORWARD AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW PROUD I AM OF THE. THANK YOU MISTER- MY LEADER READ. THANK YOU FOR I WANT TO THANK THE SPEAKER FOR A POINT ME ALONG WITH COLLEAGUES TO SET ON SUCH NUMBER. SPECIAL CONFIRMATION COMMITTEE AND TO THE CHAIRS WHO'VE OPENED US UP THIS THIS EVENING THIS AFTER. FIRST I WANT TO COME. MY FOR THANK SURELY WE- FOR HIS HIS STORY POINT. SECRETARY STATE OR NOMINATIONS WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE POINT. CLIFORNIA'S LAW SYSTEM LIKE THAT OF MY OTHER STATES TO SPEAK AND- CHALLENGES FROM COMBATING MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS TO STRENGTHENING VOTER CONFIDENCE IN OUR ELECTIONS. OUR NEXT SECRETARY STATE HAS A MONUMENTAL JOB AHEAD OF HER. SHE WILL NEED TO BALANCE THE NEED FOR ELECTION SECURITY WHILE ENSURING THAT WE ARE MAKING OUR ELECTIONS ACCESSIBLE TO ALL VOTERS. SHE WILL NEED TO BE AN ADVOCATE FOR DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES AND FOR VOTERS SEEKING ACCESS. WELL DR WEBER'S WORK IN THE ASSEMBLY AND MORE SPECIFICALLY AS PART OF THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE IS THE GREATEST TESTAMENT TO HER UNCOMPROMISED COMMITMENT TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND TO THE SAFE AND INCLUSIVE ELECTIONS THAT WE SEEK. DR WEBER IS ABUNDANTLY QUALIFIED TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THE OFFICE OF SECRETARY OF STATE. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE HOW IMPORTANT DISAPPOINTMENT IS TO SO MANY OF US. DR WEBER WILL BE THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE IN CALIFORNIA. BEING THE FIRST TO HOLD OFFICE OFTEN COMES WITH ITS OWN SET OF CHALLENGES BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT REPRESENTATION MATTERS. WHEN WOMEN ESPECIALLY WOMEN OF COLOR ARE ABLE TO SEE THEMSELVES IN POSITIONS OF POWER IT PROVIDES OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM WITH LEGITIMACY. LEGITIMACY IS SOMETHING THAT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED DURING THESE TIMES BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT SHOWS US THAT OUR SYSTEM IS CHANGEABLE. IT SHOWS US THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO ACCEPT THE WORLD AS IT IS THAT WE CAN CHANGE THINGS FOR THE BETTER. WE CAN INSPIRE OTHER WOMEN. ESPECIALLY WOMEN OF COLOR TO SEE THEMSELVES AS THE LEADERS. IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY BEIG A TRAILBLAZER DR WEBER HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT. IT'S ALSO SATISFYING WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO UP LIFT EACH OTHER TO GREATER HEIGHTSWELL I'M SADDENED WE WILL LOSE SUCH A PHENOMENAL WOMAN A LEGISLATOR AND LEADER IN THE ASSEMBLY. I'M HONORED THE CALIFORNIA WILL GET AN EXTRAORDINARILY AMAZING SECRETARY OF STATE WITH DR WEBBER. THANK YOU THANK YOU MAJORITY LEADER AS MR FOR. DR WHATEVER IT'S A THANK YOU CHAIR BUT IT'S A PRETTY TO SELL THIS COMMITTEE- ON A HOST DAY AND- ONE OF THE THINGS IS OUR RANGED WHEN I GOT A- INTO THIS POSITION THAT I HOLD NOW. WAS IT WAS NEVER AWESOME SPEAKING AFTER YOU. BECAUSE YOUR WORDS- YOUR PASSION EVEN THOUGH WE MAY NOT BEEN ON THE SAME SIDE OF AN ISSUE YOU BROUGHT A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE A PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU COULD RESPECT YOU COULD TRUST THAT IT WAS OUT OF A DEEP EMOTIONAL- COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITY THAT YOU SERVE. I THINK NOW IN A TIME OF POLITICAL DYNAMICS THAT WE HAVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE NEED LEADERS LIKE YOU IN POSITIONS LIKE THIS. THAT IT'S OKAY TO DISAGREE IT'S OKAY TO HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION. BUT WE CAN ALL STILL BE FRIENDS WE GET ALL RESPECT EACH OTHER HAVE A RELATIONSHIP THAT WE CAN HAVE A HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ACROSS GOING ON IN OUR STATE. WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS CREDIBLE COUNTRY THAT WE LIVE IN SO IT IS A PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY AND I AM. HAPPY TO CONSIDER YOU A FRIEND AND YOU HAVE BEEN AN INCREDIBLE A COLLEAGUE OF MINE- WHETHER YOU KNOW IT OR NOT A MENTOR. BECAUSE OF HOW YOU CONDUCTED YOURSELF AND I APPRECIATE YOU DEARLY SO IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER FLOOR WITH THAT I THINK WE SHOULD SKIP STRAIGHT TO THE VOTE. BUT WE WON'T. AT THIS POINT. WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PORTION OF THE AGENDA WE'RE HERE FROM THE GOVERNOR'S NOMINEE TO BE OUR NEXT SECRETARY OF STATE- DOCTOR WEBER. WE LOVE FOR YOU TO JOIN US- FOR YOUR FOR YOUR REMARKS. THANK YOU. I ALWAYS MY STUDENTS TO QUIT WHILE YOU'RE AHEAD. NON VIOLATING MY OWN SENSE OF- THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR THE OP TO. BE WITH YOU THIS AND THIS IS A EXPERIENCE FOR ME BE. IT BEGINS THE PROCESS OF MIDDLE YOU AND UP. I WANT TO CRY BUT TOUGH. AND AN AMAZING AND ASSEMBLY. IT WAS NOT ON MY LIFE CHEN TO BE BIGGER TO BE A PART OF IT. TONI ATKINS TALKED INTO A THIS MOST KNOW. AND I WONDERED WHAT WAS FOR ME. YEAH KNOW WHY WOULD I DO THIS. IN THE MIDDLE MY RETIREMENT FROM YOU. THE PUMP AND TO BE IN THE- BUT I WILL BELIEVED THAT KNOWS BEST. AND I GENERALLY TRY FOLLOW THAT PLAN I CAN'T. IT'S WITH THAT IN MIND I'M I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE WITH TODAY. AND THIS TOO WAS AN A PART OF THE PLAN. BUT IT'S HERE. HELLO THANK YOU THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR BEING HERE. FOR B. A PART OF THE MY JOURNEY FOR A YEAR. IN THE ASSEMBLY. AND AN AMAZING IN WHICH WE I THINK I BEEN ABLE TO TOUCH THE LAW. OF SO MANY CALIFORNIANS. I WILL TO THANK GOVERNOR NEWSOM. LOOKING AT ME IN PICKING OUT HAPPY ME ON THE SHOULDER WHEN I WAS LOOK. AND SAY YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS A YOU. AND ME THINKING VERY HIGH ABOUT IT I'M TRYING TO DECIDE IF IS UP I WANTED DO. IT'S AMAZING TO BE THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN IN THE HUNT AND- YEARS- TO BE SO. OF STATE. ONLY THE- AFTER AMERICAN TO BE A HOUSE OFFICER. AND I'M HUMBLED BY. COME OUT OF THE BEGINNING OF THE OF LAW ANGELES. I'M HOME AT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNE. YOU COMMITTEE HAVE GIVEN TO THINK ABOUT IN YOUR DOCTOR AND YOU HAVE THAT MATTER THINK THAT TO READ TO YOU. BUT YOU KNOW EVEN IF WE CAN IN THE MAY ELECT YEAR AN AMAZING ELECTION YEAR CAL. UNLIKE ANY OTHER. AND YOU PART OF THE ACT. BECAUSE I I'VE I'VE BEEN TO LOOK AT THE BILL'S CAME OUT OF THE COMMITTEE I WAS ON. AND EVERY THAT WE HAD TO SUE. IN THE IN THE IN THE LX COMMITTEE. EVAN LOW. MARKED BOTH OF THEM OFFERING CLOSE TO SIX SEVEN. BILL EACH. AND IF IT WAS INTERESTING TO ME BUT AS WITH. RIGHT AT THOSE LAWS THEY- AND WE HAD NO. HOW SAID. THEY WOULD. IN THIS AND. WE HAD NO IDEA THAT WHEN WE WERE OPENING. AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR TO VOTE. AND FIVE FOR EXCEPT TO VOTE IN FOR. THOSE ON PAROLE TO VOTE IN ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS. WE DIDN'T WHAT WE WILL BUILD AT THE TIME BUT WE KNOW THAT THE FILE. WE GOOD. AND THEY WE NEEDED TO DO. AND SO THIS PANDEMIC HIT. THIS STATE THE LARGEST STATE IN THE WILL PREPARE. AND YOU ARE THE REASON WHY IT WAS PER. BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE DO DO ALL IN BALLOTS AT THE BEGINNING WE MADE IN THE OPTION WE DID SOME PILOTS. AND ALL THOSE THINGS YOU TO TRY SEE IF THIS WORK. WE HAD A GOOD FOR. AND THAT WILL PUT WORKED AND I WAS HONORED AS I IT COME IN THE AT PEOPLE IN ME TRACKING MY VOTE THE SEA WHERE MY BALLOT CLOSE TO DOUBLE WHAT IF EVERYBODY WAS GOING TO IT. I KNEW THAT WHERE IT CAME FROM. IT CAME FROM THE SCHOOL THIS BY. THAT REALLY. IN ELECTIONS IN THE FORWARD. AND SO WE HAD IN A- EXPERIENCE I CAN REMEMBER WHEN WE- WERE PUSH WITH THE- INFO. PER OF A TWO. THAT WE OFTEN HAVE A BODIES. WE GOT FIFTY. YEARS COMMUNITIES GOT UP. TO COMMITTEE. OF BASICALLY SET THE FOUNDATION. AND WE HAD A GREAT WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH ALEX IDEA BECAUSE HE'S HE STOPS OF LAWSUITS AND SOME THINGS THAT. BLACK PEOPLE'S RIGHTS WOULD HAVE I WORK WITH HIM IN THE BEGINNING. AND HE UNDERSTOOD THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE. AND HIS OFFICE AND HOW WORKING TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND WE DID IT. AND SO I'M REALLY HONORED THAT THAT WE LOOKED AT THE TURN OUT. AND WE SAW TREMENDOUS PROCESS PROGRESS IN THE IN THE TURN OUT THAT WAS THE YEAR. AND WILL CONTINUE THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE IT. I KNOW PART OF THE PART TURNOUT WAS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE VOTING AGAINST SOMETHING. AND BODY HARD REPORT- AND THAT'S A PART OF IT. BUT WE SHOULD HAVE CRISIS AS THE FOUNDATION FOR BASICALLY HAVING TURNED OUT. AND I'M HOPING THAT THROUGH THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE WE CAN BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT CIVIC EDUCATION. CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY. TO HELP OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND IF NOT WE'LL TO PEOPLE AS WELL UNDERSTAND. WHAT DEMOCRACY IS. HOW FRAGILE IT IS. AND HOW WE HAVE TO PUT WORK TO MAINTAIN IT. AND THAT VOTING AS THE CENTRAL TO GET THAT TO HAPPEN. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ALREADY LOOKING AT WORKING WITH OUR SCHOOLS AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS AROUND THE WORLD. WHEN PEOPLE FAIL TO SHOW UP TO VOTE. AND HOW PRECIOUS IT IS. AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS IN THIS DEMOCRACY. TO MAINTAIN THAT. SO WE DON'T WORK ON THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES BUT WE SET THE FOUNDATION AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK THAT FOUNDATIONS MAKE IT HAPPEN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR BUSINESSES AND WORKING WITH A BUSINESSES AND THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I WHEN I WAS IN AND SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE WE HAVE ALMOST DIGITIZED ALMOST EVERYTHING COMPUTERIZED EVERYTHING. THAT WE HAVE EXCEPT FOR A LITTLE BIT THAT'S LEFT. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN OUR BUSINESSES IN THIS PANDEMIC FLOUNDER. AND NOT HAVE THE KIND OF SUPPORT THAT THEY NEEDED TO GROW. WE SEE NO NONPROFITS DO THE SAME THING. AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT PROCESS IT'S CLEAR. THAT IT'S HELPFUL THAT IT SUPPORTED THAT WE HAVE FOLKS WHO COULD HELP THE TO DO THAT. BECAUSE SO FOR SO MANY COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY SMALL BUSINESSES IS ALL THEY HAVE. FOR SO MANY FAMILIES THAT'S ALL THEY HAVE. AND SO WILL BEGIN TO WALK AWAY FROM THAT IT BECOMES DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO SURVIVE. NOT ONLY JUST FINANCIALLY BUT EMOTIONALLY AND PERSONALLY. I TO INVEST IN WE HAVE IN SOME COMMUNITIES THIRTY AND FORTY YEARS. OF RESTAURANTS IN SOME ETHNIC COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE TO FOLD. IN THE THAT THAT IS THAT IS DEVASTATING TO A LEGACY OF FAMILY. THAT IS STRUGGLE SO HARD TO KEEP THOSE THINGS OPEN AND SO WE HAVE A REALLY BIG RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE. THAT OUR PROCESS IS CLEAR THAT IT'S HELPFUL. AND WE CAN FIGURE OUT WAYS TO WORK WITH OTHER ENTITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE. ONCE AGAIN TRYING TO GET THE LICENSE BACK TRYING TO OPEN THE BUSINESSES. THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE IS THERE FOR THEM AS WELL THE LARGE BUSINESSES WELL AS A SMALL. AND PARTICULARLY OUR NON PROFITS THAT ARE STRUGGLING PARTICULARLY NON% PROFITS THAT ARE NOT LARGE NONPROFITS. IF YOU'RE A POOR COMMUNITY YOU HAVE LOTS OF NON PROFITS. YOU HAVE LOTS OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS AND CLUBS AND MASONS AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE. WHO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND HELP FOR THOSE WHO ARE. DYING FOR THOSE WHO APPEAL. AND MANY OF OUR NONPROFITS WE HAD A TOWN HALL WHICH WAS STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE. IS WILLING TO WORK ON THOSE THINGS A LITTLE WORK ON. ISSUES OF CYBERSECURITY REMAINS ALWAYS A MAJOR ISSUE THAT SHOULD NEVER EVER OVERCOME. AND YOU NEVER FINISHED. AND SO WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO PROTECT THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE FEEL CONFIDENCE IN THE BIZ IN IN WHAT WE'RE DOING. IN OUR OFFICES SO THAT THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THE SECURITY OF IT. AND WHEN THERE ARE QUESTIONS WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE HONEST. TO BE OPEN. AND BE QUICK ABOUT SO ALL THE- AND NOT PUT. THAT IT'S- WE WANT HIDE BECAUSE IT NEVER. DID A GROWS IN TIME. LET ME JUST I KNOW THERE'S A CAN ABOUT. IN THE CONTRACT THAT WAS GIVEN AN- I I'VE TOLD SOMEONE THE OTHER DAY I SIT DOWN THERE'S A BET BENNETT TO DISADVANTAGE OF BEING MARRIED TO A LAWYER FOR TWENTY NINE YEARS. IS THAT HE ALWAYS HAD A FREE PRETTY MUCH FOR YOU SURELY DON'T GIVE LEGAL ADVICE HE SAID BECAUSE YOU DON'T PRACTICE LAW WITHOUT A LICENSE THAT'S NUMBER ONE. AND HE SAID NUMBER TWO IF YOU COMMENT ON THE CASE BEFORE THAT'S THAT'S BEING LITIGATED YOU NOW BECOME THE SUBJECT OF THE CASE. AND SO UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE A PARTY. TO THE LAWSUIT. DON'T SAY ANYTHING. JUST BASICALLY SAY YOU DON'T HAVE ANY COMMENTS. BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT I'VE LOOKED AT IT. I LOOK AT IT FROM BOTH SIDES- I'VE TALKED WITH NOT ONLY ALL THE SECRETARY STATE FORM SECTOR STATE. AND THE CONTROLLER. AND I'VE LEARNED SOME THINGS ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO DIFFERENTLY. THE TRADITION IS NOT A WAY TO DO BUSINESS. BUT THE LOSS THE WAY TO DO BUSINESS. AND WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE HANDLE THOSE ISSUES AND ADDRESS THEM APPROPRIATELY IN MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE SOMETHING THAT WORKS NOW. BUT AS WE GO FORWARD IT MIGHT MIGHT ISSUES. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE DO IS WE GO FORWARD. AND AS WE GO FORWARD WE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. U. S. A LOT OF QUESTIONS YOU DIDN'T ASK MUCH ABOUT ARCHIVES. BECAUSE I GUESS YOU FIGURE THAT'S A PRETTY SECURE- AND THAT'S AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT WE DO. SO AND YOU KNOW AS I WAS THOUGHT ABOUT ALL THOSE THINGS I SAID I HAVE ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS. AND I COULD PROBABLY GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION ABOUT EACH ONE OF THOSE AS WE HAVE QUESTIONS THAT ARE ASKED. BUT. I THINK WHAT THE REAL QUESTION IS WHO IS- WHO IS THIS ONE OF THE YOU WANT AND- THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE TO. WHAT SHE MADE UP WHAT SHE BELIEVED BECAUSE IN THE END THAT'S WHAT REALLY MATTERS. THAT'S WHAT WILL DECIDE THE DECISIONS THAT I MAKE AND HOW ARE WORK WITH YOU IN THE IN IN GOING FORWARD. YOU KNOW THOSE THINGS THAT A CORE VALUE TO ME. MOST OF YOU READ MY RESUME AT SOME POINT IN YOUR LIFE AND YOU DISCOVERED THAT I HAVE A- FEW DEGREES FROM UCLA. ABOUT TIME A TWENTY SIX OF THE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR TWENTY THREE BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH. IN MY YEARS OF ADMINISTRATION AND MY WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY AND MY WORK IN THE COMMUNITY. WHAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW IS THAT I'M THE DAUGHTER OF SHARECROPPERS. AND THIS IS AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT MY LIFE. MY FATHER WAS A SHARECROPPER HIS FATHER WAS A SHARECROPPER IN HOPE ARKANSAS. AND THEY LIVED IN A LIFE THAT WAS VERY SIMILAR VERY LIMITED AND VERY SMALL. BUT MY DAD WAS PROBABLY ALWAYS PROBLEM. AND ALWAYS FOUGHT BACK FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT MOVES JUST. AND IN THE PROCESS OF THAT HE ALMOST LOST HIS LIFE. SO IF LEVEL ARKANSAS WHEN I WAS JUST THIS THE BABY OF THE FAMILY. AND LEVELS THERE. AND CAME TO CALIFORNIA WITH MY MOTHER'S MOTHER LIP. BECAUSE THEY WILL WANT TO LYNCH HIM IN HOPE ARKANSAS. AND SO WE CAME IN CALIFORNIA BUT HE HAD CAME WITH A LOT OF BELIEF AND A LOT OF STRENGTH ABOUT WHAT HE WANTED TO FORCE FAMILY. AND IN THREE MONTHS HE WORKED AND EARNED ENOUGH TO PUT US ALL ON THE TRAIN THAT WAS SIX CHILDREN INTO IT MY MOTHER. ON A TRAIN COMING TO CALIFORNIA TO LIVE AND TO CREATE A LIFE. I LIVED IN THE PUEBLOS THE PROJECTS OF LOSS AND IS WHO FIRST BUILT. WINDOWS SEVEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. LIMITED RESOURCES. WE HAD A FAMILY THAT WAS RICH IN TRADITION AND RICH IN VALUES THE REGION LOW. AND SO I GOT MY FAMILY OF MY FAMILY SHARE CROPPERS. BUT MY DAD BELIEVED WHAT THEY TWO THINGS ONE I BELIEVE IN EDUCATION. THE SECOND THING YOU BELIEVE IN VOTING. SO WHEN I BEGAN TO LOOK AT THIS POSITION OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE. I SAID HOW I FIT INTO THIS PICTURE YOU KNOW WHAT MY VALUES IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE. AND I REALIZE THAT ALL OF MY LIFE WE HAVE WE HAD THE VALUE LOADING IN MY FAMILY. NOT JUST GOING TO THE POLLS. BUT WE HAD ACTUALLY A POLL IN OUR HOUSE. MY LIVING ROOM WAS THE PROOF WAS A VOTING POLL VOTING PRECINCTS. AND THE ADDRESS OF THREE FIFTY ONE WEST FORTY FIFTH STREET PUBLISHED TWENTY YEARS. IN LOS ANGELES WAS A VOTING POLL. MY MOTHER MY FATHER OPEN OUR HOME TO VOTING BECAUSE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL COULD NO LONGER ACCOMMODATE. THE VOTING ADVOCATE BECAUSE OF LUNCH AND BREAKFAST BEING GIVEN IN THE SCHOOL. WE HAD NO LIBRARY CLOSED LAST WE HAD NO REC CENTER. SO THE ONLY PLACE WE HAD WAS SOMEONE TOLD. AND MY FATHER SAID VOTING IS TO IMPORT TO PUT IN THE GARAGE. SO I REMOVED THE FURNITURE AT EVERY ELECTION. AND PEOPLE VOTED IN OUR LIVING ROOM. SO I GREW UP WITH LOOKING AT PEOPLE VOTE EVERY DAY. AND KNOWING THAT IT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD MY DAD SAID YOU COULD DO BECAUSE HE NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO VOTE IN HOPE ARKANSAS. AND HIS DAD AND HIS MOM NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO GO IN THAT ENTIRE LIFE. BECAUSE THEY DIED BEFORE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT IT I SAY YOU KNOW I HAVE A PASSION ABOUT VOTING. I DEMAND THAT ALL MY CHILDREN BOTH MY NIECE MY NEPHEW BECAUSE EVERYBODY IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD- WHEN I WAS A STUDENT I WOULD AS A PROFESSOR THE UNIVERSITY IF YOU RUN OUT OF MY CLASS AND ELECTION YOU HAVE TO SHOW ME THE TAG TO GET REGISTERED TO VOTE. IN ORDER TO REMAIN IN MY CLASS. BECAUSE YOU COULD NOT BE AN INTELLIGENT PERSON AND NOT BUILT. AND SO AS A RESULT THAT WAS EVERY STUDENT KNEW THAT THEY HAD TO EITHER REGISTER TO VOTE IF THEY WERE. EIGHTEEN OVER. WHAT THEY HAD TO HELP SOMEBODY ELSE REGISTER TO VOTE AND BRING ME THAT. THEIR DOCUMENTATION THAT THEY HIT. BECAUSE I WANTED THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT'S A PART OF BEING AN AMERICAN. BEING ABLE TO VOTE. I'M ALSO PROUD. BELIEVER STRONGLY IN BUSINESSES. BECAUSE I LOOK AT IT NOT JUST AS THE NUMBER BUSINESSES WE HAVE IN THE LARGER SENSE. BUT I LOOK AT THE FACT THAT MY DAD WORKED EVERY DAY. IN A FACTORY. AND FOR THIRTY TWO YEARS HE DROVE BY. FROM FROM LOS ANGELES TO. BUT NOT DOWNTOWN LA ALL THE WAY TO COMMERCE. AND HE SAW THE NUMBER OF BLACK A BUSINESSES GOING OUT OF BUSINESS. EVERY YEAR. HE WATCHED THE FIRESTONE'S IN THE GOOD YEARS. AND THE BETHLEHEM STEEL'S. LEAVE OP OUR COMMUNITY. GOOD JOB THAT HE WORKED IN A STEEL MILL HIMSELF. AND HE SAW THE STRONG JOBS LEAVING IN EVERY YEAR HE TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GOING AWAY. SO THAT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHEN HE RETIRED. IN IN MARCH OF NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE IN JUNE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE HIS FACTORY SHUT DOWN. HE MISSED ABOUT TWO MONTHS. AND SO HE I KNEW THAT WHEN AND WHAT I'VE WITH A BUSINESS LEAVES IT'S NOT JUST THE BOTTOM LINE FOR CALIFORNIA. IT IS THE BOTTOM LINE FOR PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE'S LIVES AND FAMILIES ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE BUSINESSES THAT WE HAVE IN THE BUSINESS AND THE ABILITY OF THOSE GOOD BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE STABILITY FOR FAMILIES AND FOR THEM TO GROW. AND SO WHEN I THINK THE BUSINESS I NOT ONLY THINK ABOUT LARGE NUMBERS. I THINK IT WAS SMALL BUSINESSES THE BEAUTY SHOPS THAT THE BARBER SHOPS. THE RESTAURANTS YOU KNOW THE REAL ESTATE COMPANIES THOSE THINGS IN MY FAMILY HAVE OWNED FOR YEARS IN TERMS OF WORKING AS PHOTOGRAPHERS AND OTHERS THEY THOSE OF BUSINESSES THAT. HELP FAMILIES TO GROW AND TO DEVELOP AND GET TRIED TO FAMILIES AND PEOPLE. IN THE COMMUNITY SO I'M TO UNDERSTAND BUSINESS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE BOTTOM LINE. IS ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY IT. AND I CAN TELL YOU YOUR LIFE CHANGES WHEN YOUR WHEN YOUR FATHER'S FACTORY SHUTS DOWN. WHEN THEY GO ON WHEN THEY GO ON ALL A WHEN THEY LAID OFF. OF WHEN THEY'RE ON STRIKE. THE WHOLE WORLD STOP FOR YOU BECAUSE OF THE CHILD IT STOPPED FOR ME. AND SO I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF BUSINESSES THERE. I UNDERSTAND THE POINT FOR NONPROFITS IN OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE ARE MOST. COMMUNITY CENTER FOR OUR FIELD NONPROFITS. EVERYBODY WAS A GOOD IDEA STOCKTON NONPROFIT. YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO HELP THEIR NEIGHBORS THEY WANT TO HELP THEIR COMMUNITY. AND THEY NEED THE SUPPORT NOT ONLY TO START THE NONPROFIT BUT HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SUSTAIN IT. IN THESE DIFFICULT TIMES. WHEN THE PANDEMIC WE OPEN UP THE OPPORTUNITY WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO HAS A NONPROFIT ENTITY TO BEGIN TO EDUCATE MY COMMUNITY. ABOUT WHAT IT WAS TO HAVE A NONPROFIT. AND HOW TO WORK THAT NONPROFIT. OUR SECRETARY STATE NEEDS TO DO MORE THAN JUST REGISTERED NONPROFITS WE NEED TO HELP THEM FIGURE OUT HOW TO FILE THE PAPERS THEY NEED TO HELP THEM. TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE SUCCESSFUL NOT JUST THE THROTTLE TO SURVIVE BUT TO THRIVE IN IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF NONPROFITS. AND LASTLY OUR ARCHIVES THERE ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND I LOOKED AT. THIS WHOLE JOB OF SECRETARY OF STATE. FOR MY LIFE I'VE BEEN A- WORKING TO. SHE HISTORY YOUNG. OF NOT ONLY IN. BUT- THE WORLD. BUT I ALSO REALIZE THAT ALL OF MY LIFE I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND MY PAST. A PAST THAT HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM AFRICAN AMERICANS. THERE WERE FOR EVER LOOKING TO FIGURE OUT WHO ARE GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER WAS IN OUR GREAT GREAT GRANDMOTHER WAS IT. GO AND COMING THROUGH THE ARCHIVES. BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT HAVING INFORMATION BUT BASICALLY ABOUT SPREADING THAT INFORMATION. AND HELPING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT CIVIC EDUCATION AND HELPING PEOPLE APPRECIATE WHAT WE HAVE. WE HAVE TO TEACH THEM WHAT IT IS. WE HAVE TO OPEN OUR ARCHIVES. AND SO AS I TALK WITH OUR ARCHIVES DIRECTOR WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT. CREATING THE OPPORTUNITY BUT NOT JUST FOR THOSE WHO RESEARCHES TO DEAL COMING TO OUR TAX. BUT THOSE WERE CITIZENS. UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN THE ARCHIVES AND TO SHARE THEIR MATERIAL AND PUT THEM IN OUR TAX AND MAKE THOSE ARCHIVES AVAILABLE TO OUR LIBRARIES. AROUND THE STATE SO PEOPLE SO WE CAN REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT CALIFORNIA IS ALL ABOUT. BECAUSE THAT INFORMATION WILL HELP US TO GET BEYOND SOME OF THE HATRED THAT WE FEEL. SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES THAT WE FACE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THE CHALLENGES WE WILL CONTINUE TO FACE. IT IS INTERESTING AS I LOOKED AT THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S POSITION. AND TRY TO COMPARE MYSELF TO AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO WORK WITH OPINION. I REALIZE IT IS MOST THINGS MOST OF MY LIFE HAS BEEN IN PREPARATION FOR TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE. THAT THE THINGS I HAVE DONE NOT ONLY IN MY JUST GENERAL BELIEF ABOUT VOTING AND THE LEGISLATION HAS BEEN HERE. BUT MY EFFORTS TO WORK IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY RESOURCE THAT WE HAD WAS AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE. THAT THE INTERCONNECTION BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS WE TALK ABOUT THE HATRED THAT'S IN THIS COUNTRY. BUT MOST OF US LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WE LOOK AT WILL TRUMAN THE SADNESS. TREMENDOUS SADNESS BECAUSE WE THOUGHT WE WERE MUCH FURTHER ALONG THAN WE WERE. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO REALIZE THAT WE ARE PROBABLY BETTER OFF THAN WE WERE BEFORE. BUT THIS IS. WHAT HAPPENED IN TWO WEEKS AGO AS A REMINDER OF US TO ALL OF US. THAT WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP TO BE VIGILANT ABOUT THOSE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT. THAT WE COULD NOT TURN OUR BACK ON. THAT IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SECURING A VOTE SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CREATING OPPORTUNITY IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. OUR CAT BEGIN UNDERSTANDING OUR HISTORY IN THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT IS A CONSTANT JOB. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WORK AT EVERY DAY. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE ME A CHANCE ONCE AGAIN. TO EDUCATE CALIFORNIANS. ABOUT THOSE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DUCATION IS MUSCLE MY PASSION. AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO KNOW BETTER WOULD DO BETTER. AND SO I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY I THINK THE GOVERNOR FORD I THINK MY STAFF THAT'S HELPED SO MUCH IN THE LAST. FEW WEEKS OF TRANSITION IT HAS BEEN LIKE DRINKING WATER FROM A- FIRE HOSE OF COURSE. BUT I THANK YOU FOR BEING MY COLLEAGUES WILL BE MY FRIEND. FOR HELPING ME TO. FIGURE OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT CALIFORNIA. AND TO FIGURE OUT HOW I CAN. OBVIOUSLY SERVE AND SERVE BETTER. AND MAKE CALIFORNIA THE PLACE OF MY FATHER DREAMED ABOUT. MANY YEARS AGO WHEN HE BROUGHT HIS FAMILY TO CALIFORNIA. A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. FOR ALL OF US. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- DOCTOR.

BY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HELLO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR BERMAN I SIMONE WOMAN AND WEBER ABOUT. WHEN I WAS MADE AWARE OF THE NOMINATION FOR SECRETARY STATE. I SENT YOU A HAND WRITTEN NOTE AND THAT NOTE I STATED THAT IT YOUR SUCCESS IS OUR SUCCESS. AND GENUINE IN THAT SAME SENTIMENT AND IT'S VERY CLEAR AND EVIDENT ESPECIALLY WITH YOUR OPENING REMARKS THAT THIS IS A GREAT NOMINATION- AND NOW THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH SOME OF THOSE ISSUES ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE CHARACTER AND WE GET INTO THE- LESS. SEXY TOPICS ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DAILY ACTIVITIES NOT JUST IN TERMS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE OUR ELECTIONS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO THAT OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUPPORTING BUSINESSES- WE HIGHLIGHTED TO THIS COMMITTEE HIGHLIGHTED TO EARLIER ABOUT SOME OF THE OUTSTANDING ISSUES. WITH RESPECT TO THE TECHNOLOGY AND WE HAD MAY HAVE TO SPOKEN TO ABOUT THIS EARLIER ABOUT THIS IS IN REGARDS TO THAT OF REMOTE ONLINE NOTARIZATION. AS YOU KNOW AND THAT'S WHAT WE STATED THAT TWENTY TWO STATES ALREADY ALLOW ON EMERGENCY BASIS FOR THE DURATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES- THAT- FROM MODE ONLINE ORDERS ATION. THE FACT TWENTY SEVEN STATES HAVE ALREADY PASSED LEGISLATION IN THIS REGARD. UNFORTUNATELY TWO STATES HAVE NOT ADOPTED ANY LEGISLATION OR ALLOWED FOR THIS REMOTE ONLINE NOTARIZATION CALIFORNIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA. A TO MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE THREE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS. PREVIOUSLY INTRODUCED LEGISLATION MISTER CALDERON MISS RUBIO AND OTHERS- AND IT IS THE LEGISLATURE IS UNDERSTANDING AND THE COMMITTEES UNDERSTANDING THAT SPECIFICALLY WAS THAT OF THE TERMINATION OF THE SECRETARY STATE TO HELP SUPPORT. AND SHEPHERD THIS ISSUE MOVING FORWARD SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS WITH RESPECT TO AGAIN BECOME A PANDEMIC SPECIFICALLY OF COURSE THE UTILIZATION OF REMOTE SIGNING AGREEMENTS INCLUDING AGREEMENTS THAT REQUIRED NOTARIZATION. WHETHER NOT IT'S THAT AT THE LIFE AND DEATH SITUATIONS OF WILLS AND TRUSTS OR FINALIZING HOME SALES OR COMPLETING OTHER FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS THE EASE OF WAITING DOING BUSINESS. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT AS SECRETARY OF STATE THAT YOU WOULD TAKE ON THIS ROLE SERIOUSLY TO HELP PRIORITIZE THAT OF MAKING SURE THAT CALIFORNIA HELP SUPPORT HOME GROWN. TECHNOLOGIES BUT ALSO IMPLEMENTS WHAT WE KNOW IS ALREADY IN EXISTENCE. I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN WITH THE STAFF AT THAT UP IF THE SECRETARY OF STATE I SPOKE WITH THEM IS TO PUT. D. AS HE WAS OF- EXITING IN THE BUSINESS AND- WE WAIT FOR A NEW TO COME IN- SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO WORK WITH THEM. THE STAFF ON HAS BEEN INFORMED THAT THAT'S SOMETHING I WANT TO TAKE UP WITH THEM. IN TERMS OF REMOTE VOTING I MEAN THE NOTARIZATION THAT WE WANT TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. AND THEY ARGUE THAT THERE ARE SOME ALL ISSUES OF SAFETY AND WHAT HAVE YOU BUT I THINK THOSE THINGS MADE COULD BE OVERCOME. SO WE'RE WORKING ON THAT I'VE GIVEN THEM THE- THE RESPONSIBILITY TO BEGIN THE PROCESS SO WE WILL. DEFINITELY BE LOOKING AT IT HOPEFULLY GETTING SOME OF YOU INVOLVED IN THE CONVERSATION- AND TO SEE WHAT IS THE I DON'T HAVE AN OPPOSITION TO IT IN OTHER WORDS IT BUT I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT TO SAY YES LET'S DO IT. BUT I'VE HEARD ABOUT IT AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO LOOK AT- WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT BLOCKCHAIN WITH REGARDS TO- OF I ASKED THE STAFF ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF OUR PADS. IN SO WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT THE NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT'S THERE WITH THE NEW FRESH EYES AND HOPEFULLY GETTING UP FOLKS ENGAGED INVOLVED- JUST MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS THAT ARE THERE SO I THINK- CALIFORNIA'S BOYS TO DO IT. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE OPPOSITION WAS BEFORE OTHER THAN THAT. THEY THE CONCERN WAS THERE IS A SECURITY CONCERN. OKAY SO WE CAN LOOK AT THAT AND BEGIN TO DEAL WITH IT SO I HAVE TAKEN IT ON AS AN ITEM FOR THE STAFF TO BEGIN TO. INVESTIGATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS CERTAINLY. DON'T EXPECT TO TAKE A POSITION HERE SPECIFICALLY ON THAT ISSUE BUT RATHER A BOTH A MISTER BERMAN I HAIL FROM SILICON VALLEY CAN HELP DISCUSS. SOME OF THESE OUTSTANDING ISSUES AGAIN IT'S I THINK THE PRIORITY FOR THE STATE TO LOOK AT SOME OF THESE HOME GROWN TECHNOLOGIES AND IMPLEMENT THEM ACCORDINGLY. ESPECIALLY SEEING THAT FORMER MAJORITY LEADER CALLED AROUND IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN FOLLOWED BY THEN SENATOR RUBIO HAD. ATTEMPTED TO SHEPHERD THIS THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE BUT AGAIN IT IS OUR COMMITTEES UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WAS THAT OF A HANG UP IN THE SECTOR STATES OFFICE OF. VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION TO HELP WORK WITH YOU IN PARTNER ON THAT TOO. AND AS AS SIMILARLY IT IT WAS. ALSO THE COMMITTEES- UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE HAS. RECENTLY ISSUED A STATEMENT NOTING. THAT CALIFORNIA CITIZENS WHO WISH. D. TO HAVE THEIR- NOTARIZED REMOTELY. CAN OBTAIN THE SERVICES AND OTHERS. AND SO OF COURSE ALONG THOSE LINES WE LIKE TO HELP SUPPORT OUR OWN CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND TECHNOLOGIES ASSUME THAT YOU'RE SIMILARLY WOULD HELP SUPPORT THE THAT AS WELL IF IT WILL WE CAN WE CAN LOOK INTO THAT AS WELL YES OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THEN MAYBE A TRANSITION OUT OF THE IF YOU WILL BACK TO ELECTIONS. SPECIFICALLY HAVE YOU SUBMITTED BEFORE THE COMMITTEE THAT OF YOUR SUPPORT AND EXPANDING VOTER CONFIDENCE AND PARTICIPATION. AS WELL AS INSPIRING AND EXPANDING THE RIGHTS TO ONCE ACCESS TO VOTE. TO MAKE IT MORE CONVENIENT TO REGISTER TO VOTE HE VINCE ITS SUPPORT OF MAIL IN BALLOTS IN PERSON VOTING EXPANDING VOTING OPTIONS. SUPPORTING RESTORING VOTING RIGHTS FOR EX FELONS. HE ALSO STATED THAT. THE GOAL. IS A 100% PARTICIPATION. OF VOTER PARTICIPATION OF REGISTERED VOTERS AND THE INCREASING VOTER PARTICIPATION IS A CONSTANT EFFORT- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE LIKE TO LIKE TO SEE ESPECIALLY KNOWING THAT WE HAVE. AUTOMATED VOTER REGISTRATION AT SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN. A MOVE ON PREPAID POSTAGE OF ABSENTEE BALLOTS PROPOSALS OF ELECTION DAY HOLIDAY WHICH YOU'VE ALSO SUPPORTED IN THE LEGISLATURE. TO WHICH TWENTY TWO OTHER STATES ALREADY HAS THIS IN LAW- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD HELP IN THIS CAPACITY IS A STATEWIDE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS. ALSO SUPPORT- YES WE HAVE TO DO ALL WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO VOTING AND I THINK OUR OUR SYSTEM IN THE PAST HAS BEEN VERY ARCHAIC IN VERY ELITIST. THAT IT ONLY CAN HAPPEN AT A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME AND ON A CERTAIN DAY AND ONE DAY A WEEK AND UP. I THINK WE'VE SEEN AROUND THE WORLD THAT- PEOPLE HAVE LONGER TIMES TO VOTE YOU KNOW AND- AND HAVING. A MORE ROBUST KIND OF ENGAGEMENT IN VOTING AND THAT'S OUR GOAL- AND I SAVE MY GO COSTLY WORK ON IT IT'S YOU HAVE YOU DON'T PUT YOUR AND YOU'LL ALWAYS BE WORKING TO GET EVERY PERSON THEY ARE. AND WE SHOULD NEVER BE CONTENT 220% OF THE PEOPLE DECIDED NOT TO SHOW UP YOU KNOW ON SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS VOTING. AND SO MY GOAL IS ALWAYS TO BE WORKING TO IT TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO CAN'T VOTE THAT OPPORTUNITIES TO VOTE. AND I JUST TO REGISTER THEM BUT TO GET THEM TO THE POLLS. YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS WHAT IS. IMPORTANT THAT WOULD BE THERE YES. CERTAINLY IN YOUR TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THE IMPORTS OF SIEVE. AND THAT. AND FRANCHISE MEANT. AND HOW WE ARE ON OUR COLLECTIVE JOURNEY AS A STATE. TO HELP EXPAND VOTER ACCESS. THERE THERE IS THIS NOTION THAT I LEARNED ABOUT IN SCHOOL ABOUT NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. CURRENTLY THERE ARE SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD WHO OF COURSE AS YOU KNOW. I DO PAY TAXES WHETHER BE MEDICARE SOCIAL SECURITY FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. DISABILITY INSURANCE PERSONAL INCOME TAX AND OUR SALES TAX. AS WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE TWENTY TWO STATES. IN THE NATION THAT ALREADY ALLOW FOR SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS TO VOTE IN ELECTIONS. SHOULD THEY TURN EIGHTEEN BY THE GENERAL ELECTION. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS IN BERKELEY. AND SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES AVE ALL EXPORT PROPOSAL SIMILARLY TO L. HELP EXPAND VOTING RIGHTS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE WANT TO FOCUS ON. ENSURINGTHAT TRAJECTORY OF YOUNG PEOPLE- I WONDERED IF THERE MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY ESPECIALLY NOW AS- THAT OF THE CHIEF ELECTIONS OFFICER FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO. HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS AS YOU KNOW. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE LEGISLATURE. WE PASSED A MEASURE LIKE THIS WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT WITH THAT THE REPUBLICAN. MINORITY LEADER. ALSO SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE I WONDER IF THE AS THE CHIEF ELECTIONS OFFICER FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT. HOW WE CAN HELP EXPAND VOTER RIGHTS ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. I THINK WE ALWAYS LOOK AT IT YOU KNOW I'M OPPOSED TO IT. I HAVE VOTED AGAIN IT IN THE PAST- AND OVERRIDE REASONS BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M NOT I'M NOT THE RABBIT AGAINST IT YOU KNOW AND- I HAVEN'T REALLY SPOKEN ON THE FLOOR AGAINST IT- BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE VARIOUS POINTS OF VIEW AS TO WHY PEOPLE THINK IT'S SEVENTEEN VERSUS EIGHTEEN VERSUS SIXTEEN. WE'VE HEARD EVEN TALK ABOUT IS BEING SIXTEEN AND SO THERE'S CERTAIN PARTICULAR PARTICULAR REASONS WHY I THINK EIGHTEEN IS A BETTER AGE AND UP. THEN SINCE SEVENTEEN ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE CONFLICT BETWEEN WHAT WE LAID OUT A LOT EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS TO DO AND WE HAVE RAISES. THE UP THE AGE OF SMOKING I THINK IT IS BECAUSE WE THINK THEY'RE NOT MATURE ENOUGH TO MAKE THAT DECISION YET THEY'RE MATURE ENOUGH TO VOTE SO THAT IT. SO THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE TO HALF. OFF AND I WAS PLEASED THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO GO TO THE POLLS. BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S A DECISION THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO MAKE AND- AND I DIDN'T LOBBY AGAINST IT BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S ENOUGH THINGS THAT CALIFORNIA THAT PEOPLE CAN TALK ABOUT IT INTELLIGENTLY. AND THEY VOTED AGAINST. US SO WE CAN BEGIN THE CONVERSATION AGAIN BUT UP BUT I THINK THAT UP ONCE THEY VOTED AGAINST IT IT'S LIKE WELL DO WE TAKE IT UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN IT'S KIND OF LIKE. WHAT WE GONNA DO ABOUT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION ARE WE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BEAT THAT HORSE TO DO WE LOOK FOR SOMETHING ELSE THAT MIGHT EVENTUALLY. HELP PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND IT- BUT- BUT IT IS IT IS SOMETHING TO CALIFORNIA VOTED AGAINST IN THE LAST ELECTION. A WITH A LOT OF PROGRESSIVE THINGS ON THE AGENDA THEY VOTED AGAINST IT AND SO- WE CAN LOOK AT IT AGAIN YOU'RE ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE ALWAYS LEARNED IN MY LIFE IS THAT IF THINGS HAVE CHANGED IS THAT THERE'S ALWAYS CHANGE. IT WAS ALWAYS CONVERSATION. THERE'S ALWAYS AN OPPORTUNITY AND- THAT'S PROBABLY MY ACADEMIC BACKGROUND IT LOVES TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN- BUT I'M ALWAYS OPEN TO THE CONVERSATION IT'S THEIR- HAND UP AND WE CAN SEE IF PEOPLE'S. MINDS HAVE CHANGED IN TERMS OF THE PUBLIC THAT THE LEGISLATURE WITH VOTED AGAINST. FORT IT DIDN'T MAKE THE CHANGE. MAYBE IT'S TOO MANY THINGS ON THE BALLOT I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW. THAT ALWAYS HAPPENS OF PEOPLE JUST GET TIRED. AND DECIDED TO WANT EVEN MORE CHANGE AND THAT'S IT. SO- I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO SO SEVENTEEN A THOSE WERE ADVOCATES. WHICH FACE. APPROACHABLE DIFFERENTLY. AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A PER. WILLING TO LISTEN. AND A CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO BE HAD SO THEY CAN UNDERSTAND IT AND THAT MAY HAVE BEEN. IN THE MIDST OF THE NOISE OF THE ELECTION PEOPLE JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT. SO WE HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT YES SHOULD WE LEAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS PROBABLY SO TO SEE PEOPLE INTERESTED. AND I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH THOSE WHO HAVE IT AS A- AS A MAJOR AGENDA. ITEM TO BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW. AND I THINK COMMUNITIES A VERY DIFFERENT ONE OF THE THINGS I DISCOVERED WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN SAN DIEGO'S DEPENDING ON WHAT NEIGHBORHOOD YOU LIVE IN. DEPENDS ON WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE THINK ABOUT VOTING. YOU KNOW IN THE SAME IN THE SAME AREA WHERE I HAVE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE MORE. EMANCIPATED BECAUSE OF ITS LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES MAYBE THEIR PARENTS DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH OR WHATEVER MAY BE- TWO ACTIVE THEY WERE VERY IN FAVOR OF SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS VOTING. IN OTHER COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE WAS AND- THERE WERE TWO PARENTS IN THE HOUSEHOLD AND ALL THESE. THINGS THEY WERE VERY OPPOSED TO IT. SO WE HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT WE HAD BOTH OF THEM. BASICALLY OPPOSED TO ON DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE CONVERSATION SO I THINK THERE'S A CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO BE HAD. BUT IT'S NOT ALL ONE ONE DIRECTION AS WE SOMETIMES THINK IN THE LEGISLATURE. YOU KNOW. WHAT THAT THE I THINK THAT'S AGAIN AND CORN AND SPINACH ESPECIALLY. A SPIRIT OF FRANCHISING IT. THESE IN. ARE EIGHTEEN. BY THE- ELECTION BUT BECAUSE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CONTINUALLY MOVES. ARE PRIMARIES FROM JUNE TO MARCH. YOU HAVE A SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE. AND WHAT HOW WHAT A BETTER WAY TO HELP INSPIRE AND SEEING ELECTED OFFICIALS. TO INSPIRE THEM TO BE THE NEXT FREELY WEAPONS OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE GO ON HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES. AND WE HAVE BEEN TRULY. HAVE A SENSE OF VOTING. INSPIRED THAT SENSE AND SO AT LEAST THE OPEN CONVERSATION. AS WE EVOLVE AND THINK ABOUT THEN THE ROLE. AS THE CHIEF ELECTIONS OFFICER FOR THE ENTIRE STATE. NOT JUST ONE MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATRE. OF COURSE KEEPING OPEN MINDED THAT. AND IT WAS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. AND IT'S AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE ALLEGE THE SECTOR STATE DOES GOING TO BEGIN THE IRVINE. AND BRIDGES TO YOUNG PEOPLE EARLY- AND WE DID A LOT OF THOSE THAT THEY DID A LOT THIS PAST YEAR TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE READY FOR. WHEN THAT WHENEVER THE TIME WAS TO COME TO VOTE- AND SO- WE- THERE'S A ROBUST HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAM. THAT GOES INTO REGISTERED YOUNG PEOPLE TO VOTE. AND I KNOW THERE'S ALSO A PROGRAM THAT HELPS YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WORK AT THE POLLS. SHOULD BASICALLY BEGIN TO WORK THE POST TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT. AT THE CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY IS SO- WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. YES. HI THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CHAIR LOW. ANY OTHER. OR COMMENTS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION DR WEBER. THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS CHOICE ACT WAS ENACTED DURING YOUR TIME AS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS AND REDISTRICTING COMMITTEE FIFTEEN COUNTIES MAKING UP MORE THAN HALF OF THE STATE'S VOTERS USED THE VOTERS CHOICE ACT TO CONDUCT ELECTIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY. DO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO EXPANDTHE USE OF THE VOTERS FOR A SECOND CALIFORNIA- IF SO SHOULD THE STATE MANDATE THAT ALL COUNTIES CONDUCT ELECTIONS USING THEM ALL- AND IF YOU DO NOT SUPPORT MANDATING COUNTIES USE THAT MODEL HOW MIGHT WE ENCOURAGE MORE COUNTIES. TO DO SO VOLUNTARILY WELL I THINK YOU KNOW THAT TOO ISN'T AN ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE IF THEY WANT TO ACTUALLY MANDATE THOUGH THEM TO USE IT WE PASSED IT- WE PASS IT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT PEOPLE COULD OPT IN AND OPT OUT OKAY- I THINK WE DEMONSTRATED IN THIS LAST ELECTION THAT IT IS A GOOD CHOICE. AND IT'S AND PROVIDING MULTIPLE CHOICES FOR VOTING IT IS GREAT- THE LEGISLATURE COULD MANDATE IT AND I WOULD I WOULD PROBABLY BE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THEM DOING THAT- AND BECAUSE I THINK IT DOES BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF ACCESSIBILITY AND MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS A CHANCE TO VOTE IN THOSE KIND OF THINGS I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S ANY OPPOSITION TO IT AT THIS POINT. THE ONLY OPPOSITION HERBAL SOMEWHAT FOLKS WANTED A FIVE SHORTER TIME FRAME THREE DAYS VERSUS TWO WEEKS IN TERMS OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO GO TO THE POLLS AT NIGHT AND I MIGHT MY RECOMMENDATION WAS LET'S LET'S BASICALLY MAKE IT SO THAT THERE'S A MINIMUM OF THREE DAYS WHICH MEANS THE LOSS AND IT'S COULD HAVE A WEEK AND A HALF. YOU KNOW SMALLER COUNTIES CAN HAVE THREE FOUR DAYS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SHOWS UP TO GIVE THEM THE FLEXIBILITY BUT I THINK WE LEARNED A LOT IN THIS LAST ELECTION THAT IT THAT IT IS NOT THAT IT IS REALLY OF THE THINGS WE PUT IN PLACE OF REALLY GOOD THINGS. THAT IT REALLY OPENS UP PEOPLE'S OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE AND THEN WE HAVE SOMETIMES GOTTEN PAST THE FEAR OF- VOTING BY MAIL. BECAUSE I CAN REMEMBER- WORKING A CAMPAIGN BACK IN THE EIGHTIES I THINK IT WAS AND IT WAS LIKE HILL GETTING PEOPLE IN AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO VOTE BY MAIL. AND I UNDERSTOOD THEIR FEARS THEIR FEARS WHERE THEY HAD. BEEN FOR THE SOUTH THE NEW PEOPLE WOULDN'T TAKE THEY'RE BACK. YEARS WOULD BE MY THOUGHT AWAY. THEY WANT TO PERSONALLY PUT IT IN THE- BOX. THIS TIME I THINK PEOPLE LAW. AND BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WERE DONE IN THE VOTING CENTERS AND OTHER KINDS OF THINGS IN THE OPPORTUNITIES OVER THERE AND- ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. PEOPLE BECAME MUCH MORE AGREEABLE TO IT WILL COMFORTABLE AND PLUS BEING IN A PANDEMIC IT FELT IT WAS SAFER. AND THEN THE RESULTS THAT CAME OUT THAT SHOWED THE LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO VOTED THAT THEY'VE THEIR BALLOTS WERE TOSSED OUT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE KIND OF. THINGS THAT THE PEOPLE ARGUED ABOUT ACROSS THE NATION. AND SO I THINK AT THIS POINT PEOPLE OF A MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE. YOU KNOW IT TOOK A WHILE. BUT I THINK WE'RE READY FOR IT AT THIS POINT. I AM BIASED BUT I AGREE- THE COUNTRY SAW. PRESIDENT LEVELS IN IN THIS IS A BIG CONCERN FOR ME OF MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION IN CONNECTION. WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY GENERAL ELECTION- INCLUDING UNFORTUNATELY FROM ELECTED OFFICIALS. WHO SHOULD REALLY KNOW BETTER. WHAT ROLE DOES THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAVE IN HELPING TO COMBAT- YOU KNOW THESE MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION WARS THAT ARE BEING WAGED. WELL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED THIS LAST YEAR THEY HAD- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE THAT DOES OUTREACH. AND IN MY CONVERSATION WAS WITH WITH MANY OF THEM TO SAID WE NEED TO. EXPAND THOSE NUMBERS TO DO OUTREACH. ARE NOT JUST IN TERMS OF REGISTERED PEOPLE TO VOTE. BUT WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT INFORMATION THAT COMES OUT. IS COUNTERED. COUNTED BY WILL BE CALLED TRUSTED MESSENGERS. SO THAT PEOPLE IN COMMUNITY SAID THAT YOU CAN REACH OUT TO NON BUSINESSES AND BARBER SHOPS AND PLACES WOULD YOU CAN PUT INFORMATION. SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW. THAT WHAT THE CORRECT INFORMATION IS ABOUT AND SO WE HAVE TO REALLY BE VERY ENGAGING VERY INVOLVED. IN MAKING SURE THAT THE INFORMATION IS CLEAR THAT THAT. IF THERE IS MISINFORMATION AND WE ARE RESPONDING TO IT. THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PERSONS AND COMMUNITIES WHETHER THE LECTIN OFFICIALS OR SECRETARY OF STATE OR WHOEVER IT IS. THAT IS A TRUSTED MESSENGER THAT CAN ACTUALLY TELL PEOPLE THIS IS WHAT IT'S REALLY BOUT. AND HAVE THOSE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM ABOUT. THE MISINFORMATION IS THERE. SO THAT WILL ALWAYS BE AN ONGOING CHALLENGE. BECAUSE AS WE MADE- THE ABILITY TO SPREAD MESSAGES EASIER. FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC. NOW WE HAVE TO ALSO KIND OF THOSE MESSAGES WHEN THEY COME UP AND THAT AND SO THERE IS A SECTION. IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE THAT HAS TO BE INCREASED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ALWAYS ON TOP OF. RESPONDING TO THE MISINFORMATION THAT'S THE IT. AND USING OUR OUR OUR LIKE TO OFFICIALS TO HELP US DO THAT. CREATING THINGS FOR YOU TO PUT ON YOUR WEBSITE TO. UNDERSTAND WHAT THE INFORMATION IS ABOUT. AND BEING ON TOP OF IT SO THAT WE CAN- FIRST HOPEFULLY SQUASH THE INFORMATION AS IT COMES OUT BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF. MISINFORMATION IT IS FOR IT. AND IT SPREADS RATHER QUICKLY. WITHOUT. IF YOU DON'T RESPOND TO IT. SO MY GO IS TO TRY TO. THOSE FOR WHO IS THE ALBUM BUT TOOK. IN THE OF MR. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE GOOD. OUT FOR THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NEW VOTING RULES ARE. WHERE THEY WHERE THEY CAN GO VOTE YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE BALLOT YOU KNOW THE SPECIFIC MASON WILL THEY WON'T COUNT OF THE TWO WEEKS IT WILL YOU KNOW. KIND OF STUFF. WE CAN GET THAT INFORMATION OUT QUICKLY TO PEOPLE SO THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR FOCUS AND PASSION FOR THAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS PLEASE MR OLDHAM. THE DOCTOR WEBER I THINK- YOU'VE DEMONSTRATED YOURSELF OVER THESE LAST TWO YEARS TO BE A PROLIFIC. LEGISLATOR AND FROM TIME TO TIME THE LEGISLATURE HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE SPONSORED LEGISLATION FROM OUR STATEWIDE. ELECTED OFFICIALS DO YOU SEE- FORESEE AN OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU WOULD. LOOK TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE NUMBER THERE A LOT OF IDEAS THAT HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT TODAY BUT EVEN GOING FORWARD I KNOW THAT LAST YEAR WE SAW A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE. ARE REALLY ENGAGED AROUND SOCIAL JUSTICE AND MAKING SURE THEIR VOICES WERE HEARD IT WAS REALLY RATHER INSPIRING TO SEE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROCESS. AND SO I GUESS I'M JUST WITHIN THAT THAT AREA ARE YOU- THINKING THAT THAT MIGHT BE A WAY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON IDEAS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE WANTED TO PURSUE HAD YOU- CONTINUE TO BE IN THE LEGISLATURE. YOU KNOW- AS I TELL FOLKS I'M ONLY GOING ACROSS THE STREET SO. I WOULD DEFINITELY BE ENGAGED IN INVOLVED IN IN LEGISLATION THAT DEALS WITH ISSUES OF SOCIAL JUSTICE BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE WHOLE PROCESS OF. THE VOTING IS ABOUT EMPOWERING PEOPLE TO FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S SOME JUSTICE FOR EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY- IN ADDITION TO THAT I HAVE A PACKET OF LEGISLATION THAT I'M LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW THAT THAT THAT THAT. THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE AUTHORED AS WELL AS A SECOND HERE STATE'S RECOMMENDATION OF THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN- SO AND SO WE'VE THERE WILL BE A COLLABORATION BETWEEN. THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE AND ELECTIONS AS WE ALWAYS HAVE HAD- IN TERMS OF THIS PARTICULAR IDEAS AND ISSUES THAT COME FORWARD- THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT BECAUSE EVERY ELECTION BRINGS IN CHALLENGES AND OBVIOUSLY BUT MAKES US LOOK AT THINGS DIFFERENTLY THE VOTING BOX THING IS. YOU KNOW IT IS BIG AND IT'S OUT THERE AND EVEN THOUGH DIDN'T CAUSE MUCH DOES DO ITS DAMAGE IS THE MEDIA HAD THOUGHT IT WOULD BUT IT IT REMINDED US THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE HAVE TO TIGHTEN UP. AND I THINK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT- THAT ALREADY A LITTLE BIT SO WE WILL BE I WILL BE ENGAGE WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THOSE ISSUES AS WELL AS ISSUES OF SOCIAL JUSTICE. YES LET ME JUST SAY THAT- MORE PROBABLY ONE OF. A REGRET THAT I HAVE- WHEN I WAS AT SAN DIEGO STATE AND I DID NOT TAE YOUR COURSE- BUT THEN AS I. YOU KNOW I WAS THERE AT THE SAME TIME AS SENATOR BRADFORD- AND THE LOOK ON HIS FACE WHEN HE WALKED OUT OF YOUR- CLASSROOM SUGGESTED THAT. YOUR COURSES WERE RATHER DIFFICULT IT PROBABLY WAS A GOOD THING THAT I DID NOT. TAKE THEIR COURSES BUT I DO REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORKING WITH YOU. YOU'LL START. I FIRMLY. THAT MY- WOULD RIP. ME AT SOME POINT AND I HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN DO IT WELL. MR FOR. ERIC MISERABLE TIMES YOUR ULTIMATE GOAL AND THAT I AGREE WITH THAT THE OUTER MY CONTACT JUST BECAUSE- WAS TO GET HOW TO PRECIPITOUS THE PATIENT- IN AND I THINK THAT'S AN AWESOME GOAL THAT WE AS AMERICANS SHOULD STRIVE FOR AND IT'S A VERY NOBLE GOAL WITH THAT ALSO COMES ACCURACY I DO WE TRUST OUR VOTING SYSTEM. AND GIVEN THE PRESSURES YOUR PREDECESSOR ALLOW THE CALIFORNIA VOTER ROLLS TO BECOME IN THE WORDS OF THE CARTER BAKER COMMISSION INVITATION TO FRAUD HOW WOULD YOU A SECRETARY STATE INSURE. THE ONLY ELIGIBLE CITIZENS. CAN BE CAN. AND CAN VOTE ONLY ONCE IN AN ELECTION AND IN THAT. LIKE WHAT CAN WE DO. AND THE COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL LAW I THINK THESE THINGS ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT- FOR THE CONTINUITY OF OUR OUR VOTE. NO QUESTION THAT- THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE VOTING ARE ELIGIBLE AND THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY WORKING TO MAKE SURE WE SCREW UP OUR LIST TO MAKE SURE THOSE WHO ARE DECEASED TENTACLES OF LEFT THE STATE. AND NO LONGER ON OUR ROLES IN MY CONVERSATION WITH THE STAFF- THEY'VE- IT IN AND TALKING WITH THEM YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO WORK HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- THAT WE ARE IN LINE WITH THE VARIOUS COUNTIES THAT ARE GIVING US REPORT TO COME IN THAT THEY ARE IN LINE WITH THAT. THE FOLKS WHO PROVIDE DATA SAID STATISTICS WITH REGARDS TO DEATHS AND MOVEMENTS AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE THERE A SYSTEM AS LARGE MAY HAVE A FEW BUT HOPEFULLY NOT VERY MANY IN TERMS OF. WELL REPORTING AND SO BUT I'VE I'VE ASKED HIM TO GIVE ME A COPY OF THE REPORT TO SEE EXACTLY WHO IS HOW HOW MANY INCIDENTS THAT THAT WAS WHERE THEY ARE IN IN TERMS OF THAT. WELL WE'VE SEEN. A LOT OF- I. IT WAS A LOT OF THINGS IN A BETTER ARE PEOPLE OR IT'S IN TERMS OF BATTLES FOUR OF SUPERVISORS REGISTER VOTER THAT IT THAT IT THAT IT KINDS OF I WANT MY BEST TRY TO WORK WITH EACH OF THOSE THE RICH VOTER TO GET THEM BOARD TO HELP THEM JUST HOW IMPORTANT THE WORK IS THAT THEY DO THAT IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE I DON'T I DON'T THINK THIS IS A PARTISAN EVEN I'M A DEMOCRAT I DON'T TAKE THIS AS A PARTISAN JOB BECAUSE I WANT EVERY REPUBLICAN TO VOTE. AND I WANT TO FRANCHISE ALL OF CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE ANY TIME ANY GROUP IS THIS WHAT IS IT FEELS A BIT NOT IN FRANCHISE YOU HAVE THE OUTBREAKS IN THE THINGS THAT OCCUR THAT WE SEEM BECAUSE PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY'RE NOT BEING HEARD IN SO LONG MAKES EVERYONE HEARD OF BUT WE WILL BE WORKING TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE DATA THAT COMES IN IT IS ACTUALLY SCRUB THAT THERE THAT WOULD ARE PULLED OUT ROLES ARE. AS MY AS ONE CLASS CAN BE ACCURATE AND WITH THE STATE THE SIZE WITH WE HAVE SEVENTEEN ALMOSTEIGHTEEN MILLION VOTE THIS PASS TIME- CAN I TELL YOU ALL EIGHT OF WERE- WERE FOLKS WHO VOTE HOPE SO- DID I CAN I YOU THE ONE OF TWO PEOPLE D. GET THE RIGHT BACK I WISH I COULD SAY THEY DIDN'T YOU KNOW BUT WHAT EIGHTEEN THAT WE CAN WOULD WE'RE BACK FOR HER. TO ACTORS YEAH NO APPRECIATE THAT AND I'M WE COME BACK A THE VERY INTEREST ELECTION CYCLE YOU KNOW WE HAD MASSIVE OUT YOU KNOW EIGHTEEN YOU KNOW FOR PRESIDENT SEVENTY VOTE FOR FORMER AND WHICH IS EXCITING AND A LOT WAYS BUT WHAT THAT SHOW US IS WE HAVE A COUNTRY AND I THINK FOR AS CALIFORNIA THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD. ELECTED TO. OURSELVES IN LEADING THE WAY AS IT IS TO. ON BEING. ABOVE AND BE. LEAVE THE COUNTRY IN A LOT OF. FRONTS YOU ARE THERE ARE. PERSON THAT THE RIGHT TIME. TO BRING. A OF KERR. WE THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS. THAT OUR RULES. ARE ACCURATE. AND I LOVE THE FACT. YOU MAKE A I DID I HEAR CA. FROM THAT YOU ARE GOING TO LOOK INTO THIS BECAUSE THERE IS A LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE THAT THE- OF TRUST THAT'S MISSING RIGHT NOW. THANK HAVE TO BRING THAT BACK. BECAUSE YOUR ABILITY TO VOTE IS ONE A BETTER OX. OF OUR ACCOUNT OF OUR COUNTRY. OF OUR DEMOCRACY. IT'S INCREDIBLY ENCOURAGING THAT YOUR HERE AT THIS TIME AND SO I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU LIKE TO DO I AND I AND I KNOW THIS BUT- PLEASE TAKE THE SERIOUS BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY OF US THAT ARE ROOTING FOR YOU. THAT WANT OUR STATE TO BE ON THE- THE PRECIPICE TO BE WHAT EVERYBODY STRIVES WHEN IT COMES TO VOTER ROLLS SO I APPRECIATE THAT. AND THEN ON THE TOP OF THE OF. MAIL IN BALLOTS- ROQUE WOULD YOU SUPPORT. I MEAN GIVING SOME OF THOSE. DANGERS YOU KNOW I'VE HAD A COME. ACTUALLY INTERESTING- YOU KNOW THE AFTER AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO DIDN'T LIKE MAIL IN BALLOTS AND IT ALMOST IS LIKE FLIPPED YOU KNOW. SUDDENLY THERE WAS A BACK- ID ON THIS. WHAT CAN WE- TO MAKE SURE THAT LIKE THE COUNTIES. HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE DECISIONS AND WOULD YOU SUPPORT THE STATE COMING AND BASICALLY TAKING AWAY THAT COUNTY ABILITY FOR MAIL IN BALLOTS. AND YOU KIND OF TOUCHED ON JUST EVER SO BRIEFLY ON WORKING WITH YOU KNOW THE OFFICE OF. VOTE BUT- IT WOULD YOU SUPPORT TAKING THAT DECISION AWAY FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON THE MAINLAND OUTSIDE. I WILL HOPE THAT- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT YOU FOLKS HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BASICALLY DECIDE OF BECAUSE YOU WRITE THE LEGISLATION AS TO WHETHER THAT IT'S A MANDTE VERSUS EIGHTY- A SUGGESTION. THAT THERE- I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE IT SO ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH THAT PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO DO IT. NO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HEARD FROM- ONE OF THE NEWS. PER PERSON WAS INTERVIEWING ME BASICALLY SAY THAT. MANY OF THE REGISTRARS OF VOTERS THIS TIME REALLY LIKE WHAT TOOK PLACE BECAUSE WE GAVE THE MONEY TO GET IT DONE. YOU KNOW WE PROVIDED THEM WITH THE STAFF THAT WAS ESSENTIAL TO DEAL WITH THE ABSENTEE BALLOTS AND MAIL IN BALLOTS AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. WHAT WE DIDN'T BEFORE. I THINK IT'S AS MUCH AS WE CAN GET OUR PUBLIC OR COUNTIES AND OTHERS TO BE COOPERATIVE AND TO BE SUPPORTIVE. YOU KNOW IT'S ALWAYS BETTER IT'S ALWAYS BETTER THAN A MANDATE IT REALLY IS IF YOU CAN GET PEOPLE TO WORK WITH YOU. CAN THEY I'M NOT SURE BECAUSE I'VE SEEN SOME THINGS THIS IS SOME WILL AND SOME WON'T- BUT THE MAIN THING IS THAT WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA HAS ACCESS TO A BALLOT. AND ACCESS TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE AND THAT'S THEN THAT'S WHAT'S THE MOST CRITICAL THING WHETHER IT'S MILLION OR NOT- MILLION MAKES IT CONVENIENT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE TO GET A MAIL IN BALLOT BUT THEN THEY SHOULD. IF THEY GET A MAIL BALLOT THEY SHE'LL SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TURN IT IN. AND THAT'S WHY I FIRMLY BELIEVE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO DO NOT WANT TO PUT THE STUFF IN THE MAIL. AND WHO FEEL THE MAIL SLOW. I MEAN I GOT SOME STUFF THE OTHER DAY THAT WAS MAILED ME IN NOVEMBER I'M GONNA BE VERY HONEST WITH YOU AGAIN LEBANESE. EDUCATION AND I'M A LITTLE UPSET THE I GOT TWO DAY AGO BUT- BUT THEY A WHOLE LOT FOLKS WHO DON'T MAN. YOU MAY IT TO THE- BUT THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO WALK TO PLAY AND PUT IT IN AND- WHAT. WITH THE ALL THE BUILDINGS. THE MAIL THE- I DID. BY THAT PEOPLE CAN A MAN I MINE IN THE- INTO THE- OF THE LIBRARY OF MY- LIBRARY. I MEAN. HAVING THAT OF. TO PAY IS IN OUR AND SHE ALWAYS BE AN OPTION. PEOPLE SUB EVERY JUST AT. JUST LIKE TO BE ABLE TO PUT. IN BOX. YOU KNOW. AND TO DO THE- AND THEN. I THINK THAT. EXTREME IMPORTANT. AND WHICH ALWAYS THAT IS AND I. THAT'S AVAILABLE TO. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO MAIL IT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO. EVEN IF WE MAY IF WE SAY. EVERY ABOUT. THE HAVE THE AFTER TO BE- IT INTO. YEAH WHAT I. DID EXACTLY AS- THING. BY MAIL ABOUT AND WHY. IN THE- YEAH AND I. DON'T THAT IF WE- IF WE LOOK AT OUR VOTE. ROLLS A LOT THIS THIS- MAIL IN BALLOTS THAT. KIND OF GOES A- IF. TRUST THE RULES ACCURATE YEAH IF I. IT'S ALL. ACTION THAT THAT BE. EXTRA POOR. FOR AND KEEP IN MIND YOU KNOW NOT AND I. FROM THE- POINT OF VIEW. I GUESS. WHERE I. THAT WOULD. THE BEST CAN. BUT I WAS FROM A- WHERE PEOPLE. DO THE- THEY COULD. AND- AND SOME. KIND OF THE VOTER ROLL. AND- AND- AND WE'RE- NOT IT'S FEAR WITHIN THAT. TAKEN OFF SHOULDN'T BE. OFF KNOWN PULLED. EEN TAKE OFF THE- TO- EARLY. AND THEY DIDN'T. IN A LETTER AND DIDN'T. DID NOT. THEM WHATEVER IT MAY BE AND THEY- GO. TO GET READY TO VOTE IN. NOT ON THE- SO THE- FOLKS ARE EQUALLY IF. THEN HAVING YOU KNOW THE DEATH. BIT PERSON. COME TO YOUR HOUSE. WE THEY'VE BEEN A DISTANT. BECAUSE OF. US NOT HAVING A- PROCESS. AND WHEN WE IT HAPPEN. IT IS. PEOPLE KIND. IN VOTING- A- IF THEY- AND WHEN. BEEN CUT A LOT. OUT OF THIS. IN FRANCHISE IN CALIFORNIA. I COMPLETELY AGREE AND TO. ENSURE I APPRECIATE YOU CORRECTING THE RECORD- PRESENT BY GOT EIGHTY ONE MILLION VOTED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT SEVENTY FOUR MILLION SO I APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER HALL. WILLIAM IS DURING THIS WORLD I AT. IT WOULD TAKE A MILLION YEAH. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS LEADER IS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I TO- OUT. FILLING OUT FELLOW IT TOOK AND DROVE IT TO THE RED AND IT THERE- AND REGARDING THE ROLES I MY UNCLE DIED AFTER THE PRIMARY AS A RESULT OF KOPET BEFORE THAT THE GENERAL ELECTION AND THE NOTICE WAS RECEIVED THAT HIS NAME HAD BEEN TAKEN OFF. SO I APPRECIATE AT LEAST SAMBAR TO DINO COUNTY WAS DOING IT RIGHT. MY QUESTION IS CLEARLY WE HAD AN AMAZING TURNOUT THIS LAST ELECTION I WITH A RECORD HIGH OF 80% JUST AS YOU'VE DISCUSSED EARLIER AND MY QUESTION IS WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS TO CONTINUE THE SUCCESS. WELL I THINK PART OF IT AS A STATE IS THAT IT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU LEARN IS THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE VOTE. OF FOUR AND THAT'S IMPORTANT- BUT HAPPENS WHEN WE DON'T VOTE AT ALL. AND UNFORTUNATELY OUR COMMUNITIES DON'T SEE THE FLIP SIDE. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LACK OF RESOURCES THAT COME INTO A COMMUNITY WHEN YOU DON'T BOOK. OF THE LACK OF REPRESENTATION THAT HAPPENS IN COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T VOTE. AND SO WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO EDUCATE THEM ON BOTH SIDES OF THE COIN IS NOT ONLY WHY YOU VOCAL WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T. AND THAT BECOMES IMPORTANT WE DO THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ISSUES LIKE CIVIC EDUCATION OUTREACH EFFORTS THAT ARE GOING OUT TO DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. MAKING SURE THAT WE THAT WE HAVE MORE THAN JUST A SUGGESTION FOR YOUNG FIRMANDO COMING UP ROLE BUT TO REGISTER TO VOTE. BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT NOT GIVING A LITTLE. AND A HOST OF THINGS WE COULD REGISTER AT THE SAME TIME TO VOTE. I'M MAKING SURE THEY GET THE CORRECT INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT. THAT WILL INCREASE HOPEFULLY THE NUMBER PERSON TO ON THE PHONE THE FOOTBALL OF ROLES TO VOTE. BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE DO THE KIND OF- OUTREACH AND PUBLICITY THAT'S ALWAYS CENTRAL AS WE GET IT. AS WE GET TOWARD THE VOTING- TIME FRAME THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT IT'S TIME TO VOTE THEN AND IF IT AND EMPHASIZING A VERY POSITIVE WAY TO THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON. LOADING IT. THE ABOUT IT- IT WAS A MAY IN THE ELECTION IN GEORGIA. ARE HOW YOU KNOW JAZZ WORK BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT THAT THIS VOTE MEANT SOMETHING. AND WE NEED TO HELP HELP HELP PEOPLE CONTINUE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE VOTES COUNT. AND AND NOW THAT WE'VE GOT THE MOMENTUM IT'S A QUESTION OF DO WE KEEP THE MOMENTUM AND WE KEEP IT BACK POSSIBLY PUTTING UP THE PUBLICITY THE RELATIONSHIP. MAKE USING OUR TRUSTED MESSENGERS USING OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS TO CONSTANTLY TALK ABOUT WHY PEOPLE NEED TO GO TO THE POLLS AND WHY THEY. NEED TO VOTE. THANK YOU AND- CHAIR. BERMAN CHAIR LOW- WOULD YOU ENTERTAIN. YES PLEASE. I MOVE THAT THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE RECKON THAT THE IS ADVICE AND TO THE APPOINT BY THE GOVERNOR OF SURELY AND WE'RE AS THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR CAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

MY ANCESTORS MY MOTHER AND FATHER WOULD ALWAYS BE PROUD OF THE FACT THAT I'VE FOUGHT FOR IT THE PERSON WHO HELPED ME TO BECOME WHO I AM. I STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF SOME AMAZING PEOPLE WHO WERE STRONG AND DETERMINED BUT THEY WEREN'T FAMOUS THEY WON'T EVEN WELL KNOWN IN IN IN SOMETIMES DON'T COMMUNITIES BUT WHAT THEY GAVE ME WAS A SENSE OF PURPOSE AND PROSPECTIVE.
