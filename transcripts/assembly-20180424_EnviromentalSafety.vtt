FISH TASKS.

00:27:03.822 --> 00:27:06.892 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

00:27:05.591 --> 00:27:09.895 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS WITH THIS.

00:27:06.892 --> 00:27:11.797 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THAT FISH.

00:27:09.895 --> 00:27:14.166 region:rollup2
PUT UP WITH THE LIVE FISH.

00:27:11.797 --> 00:27:16.468 region:rollup2
COULD BE REPLACED WITH A COUPLE

00:27:14.166 --> 00:27:18.370 region:rollup2
OF ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE AS.

00:27:16.468 --> 00:27:20.105 region:rollup2
I HUGE I AS AN AN AN ISSUE WITH

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:22.274 region:rollup2
RELATE REGARDS TO HUMANE USE OF

00:27:20.105 --> 00:27:22.441 region:rollup2
ANIMALS.

00:27:22.274 --> 00:27:25.210 region:rollup2
AND.

00:27:22.441 --> 00:27:27.579 region:rollup2
.

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:29.615 region:rollup2
WE SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT

00:27:27.579 --> 00:27:31.350 region:rollup2
OFFERS DTS SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:27:29.615 --> 00:27:32.784 region:rollup2
ASSESS ADVANCES AND TEST METHOD

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:34.419 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT.

00:27:32.784 --> 00:27:35.687 region:rollup2
AND TOXICOLOGY PRACTICE TO TAKE

00:27:34.419 --> 00:27:37.990 region:rollup2
A MORE INTELLIGENT APPROACH TO

00:27:35.687 --> 00:27:39.858 region:rollup2
TOXICITY TESTING.

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:41.260 region:rollup2
ANALYSES I'M GONNA TALK BRIEFLY

00:27:39.858 --> 00:27:42.628 region:rollup2
ABOUT ONE OF THE ALTERNATIVES

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:45.664 region:rollup2
ANALYSES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE

00:27:42.628 --> 00:27:46.899 region:rollup2
DAPHNIA ARE SIMILAR TO FINISH.

00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:49.168 region:rollup2
AND IF A BIT MORE SENSITIVE TO

00:27:46.899 --> 00:27:50.869 region:rollup2
TOXIC MATERIALS.

00:27:49.168 --> 00:27:52.938 region:rollup2
THE TEST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE

00:27:50.869 --> 00:27:54.940 region:rollup2
FISH ADULT TEST ARMED GROUPS OF

00:27:52.938 --> 00:27:57.876 region:rollup2
DAPHNIA ARE EXPOSED TO TEST

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:58.177 region:rollup2
MATERIAL AND. SEVERAL DILUTIONS

00:27:57.876 --> 00:28:00.646 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

00:27:58.177 --> 00:28:01.680 region:rollup2
AND SEVERAL DILUTIONS AND AND

00:28:00.646 --> 00:28:03.515 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF IMMOBILIZE DAPHNE

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:06.552 region:rollup2
ARE COUNTING AFTER TWENTY FOUR

00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:06.552 region:rollup2
OR FORTY EIGHT HOURS.

00:28:06.618 --> 00:28:11.523 region:rollup2
TOXIC OF A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF

00:28:08.053 --> 00:28:12.090 region:rollup2
DAPHNE A FAILED TO SURVIVE.

00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:13.192 region:rollup2
A DEATH NEAR IMPORTANT FOOD

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:15.093 region:rollup2
SOURCE FOR FOR

00:28:13.192 --> 00:28:15.961 region:rollup2
ANOTHER QUANTIC ORGANISMS

00:28:15.093 --> 00:28:17.462 region:rollup2
MAKING THE DAPHNIA TOXICITY

00:28:15.961 --> 00:28:18.864 region:rollup2
TESTING INDICATOR OF POTENTIAL

00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:20.966 region:rollup2
AFFECTS.

00:28:18.864 --> 00:28:23.936 region:rollup2
OF A WASTE ON AQUATIC SYSTEMS

00:28:20.966 --> 00:28:26.638 region:rollup2
BEYOND THE SPECIFIC SPECIES OF

00:28:23.936 --> 00:28:28.040 region:rollup2
FISH USED IN THE LIVE FISH TO.

00:28:26.638 --> 00:28:29.441 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO CONSIDERATION OF

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.943 region:rollup2
THE TWO TESTS ALTERNATIVES WE

00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:32.344 region:rollup2
SUGGEST IMPLEMENTING A TIERED

00:28:30.943 --> 00:28:33.178 region:rollup2
APPROACH THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT

00:28:32.344 --> 00:28:35.180 region:rollup2
CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS.

00:28:33.178 --> 00:28:36.481 region:rollup2
.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.416 region:rollup2
OF THE WASTE IN A TOWARD

00:28:36.481 --> 00:28:39.084 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHAT IF ANY TESTING

00:28:37.416 --> 00:28:40.152 region:rollup2
SHOULD TAKE PLACE

00:28:39.084 --> 00:28:42.487 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN IMMEDIATELY GOING TO

00:28:40.152 --> 00:28:43.755 region:rollup2
THE LIVE.

00:28:42.487 --> 00:28:46.692 region:rollup2
THIS IS VERY COMMON PRACTICE IN

00:28:43.755 --> 00:28:47.993 region:rollup2
OTHER REGULATORY JURISDICTION.

00:28:46.692 --> 00:28:49.461 region:rollup2
IN MY OPINION THE TWO TESTS ARE

00:28:47.993 --> 00:28:50.829 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFICALLY APPROPRIATE AND

00:28:49.461 --> 00:28:52.831 region:rollup2
ARE LIKELY TO BE ADAPTABLE FOR

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:54.533 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S NEED. TO ENSURE THE

00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:56.268 region:rollup2
PROTECTION OF AQUATIC LIFE

00:28:54.533 --> 00:28:58.170 region:rollup2
AGAINST A RANGE OF VOLATILE

00:28:56.268 --> 00:29:01.073 region:rollup2
LIQUID AND SOLID WASTES WHILE

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:04.876 region:rollup2
SAVING ANIMALS AND STATE RISK.

00:29:01.073 --> 00:29:06.645 region:rollup2
DAFFY OUR WATER FLEAS.

00:29:04.876 --> 00:29:08.480 region:rollup2
GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR

00:29:06.645 --> 00:29:09.748 region:rollup2
HAVING ME HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS

MARLA JEFFRIES AND I AM AN

00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:13.018 region:rollup2
ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF BIOLOGY

00:29:11.717 --> 00:29:14.519 region:rollup2
AT TEXAS CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY IN

00:29:13.018 --> 00:29:15.654 region:rollup2
FORT WORTH TEXAS.

00:29:14.519 --> 00:29:16.855 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN CONDUCTING

00:29:15.654 --> 00:29:18.490 region:rollup2
TOXICOLOGICAL RESEARCH FOR

00:29:16.855 --> 00:29:20.392 region:rollup2
NEARLY FIFTEEN YEARS AND OVER

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:22.094 region:rollup2
THE LAST SEVEN YEARS MUCH OF MY

00:29:20.392 --> 00:29:24.129 region:rollup2
RESEARCH HAS BEEN DEDICATED TO

00:29:22.094 --> 00:29:25.497 region:rollup2
EXAMINING THE UTILITY. OF THE

00:29:24.129 --> 00:29:28.133 region:rollup2
FAT ADMIN ó FISH EMBRYO

00:29:25.497 --> 00:29:29.901 region:rollup2
TOXICITY TEST AS A REPLACEMENT

00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:32.004 region:rollup2
FOR TEST METHODS THAT REQUIRE

00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:33.872 region:rollup2
OLDER MORE DEVELOPED FISH.

00:29:32.004 --> 00:29:35.707 region:rollup2
IN PRACTICE THE FISH EMBRYO TEST

00:29:33.872 --> 00:29:37.442 region:rollup2
IS SIMILAR TO OTHER TESTS TYPES

00:29:35.707 --> 00:29:38.677 region:rollup2
GROUPS OF EMBRYOS ARE EXPOSED TO

00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:40.612 region:rollup2
SEVERAL DELUSIONS OF TEST

00:29:38.677 --> 00:29:41.847 region:rollup2
MATERIAL. AND THE NUMBER OF

00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:43.315 region:rollup2
EMBRYOS THAT PARISH ARE COUNTED

00:29:41.847 --> 00:29:45.584 region:rollup2
EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS FOR THE

00:29:43.315 --> 00:29:47.185 region:rollup2
DURATION OF THE TEST.

00:29:45.584 --> 00:29:49.388 region:rollup2
I THINK OFFICIALLY OF TOXICITY

00:29:47.185 --> 00:29:50.922 region:rollup2
TEST WAS ADOPTED BY THE OECD AND

00:29:49.388 --> 00:29:52.224 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTEEN. AS AN

00:29:50.922 --> 00:29:53.859 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE TO THE FISH ACUTE

00:29:52.224 --> 00:29:54.826 region:rollup2
TOXICITY TEST

00:29:53.859 --> 00:29:56.628 region:rollup2
A TEST SIMILAR TO THE STATIC

00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:57.729 region:rollup2
ACUTE BIO ACID BEING USED HERE

00:29:56.628 --> 00:29:59.665 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA TO CLASSIFY

00:29:57.729 --> 00:30:01.366 region:rollup2
HAZARDOUS WASTES.

00:29:59.665 --> 00:30:02.567 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO THIS ADOPTION EXTENSIVE

00:30:01.366 --> 00:30:04.870 region:rollup2
VALIDATION EFFORTS WERE

00:30:02.567 --> 00:30:06.872 region:rollup2
UNDERTAKEN TO ENSURE THE

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:08.473 region:rollup2
REPRODUCIBILITY AND SENSITIVITY

00:30:06.872 --> 00:30:10.609 region:rollup2
OF THE FISH EMBRYO TEST RELATIVE

00:30:08.473 --> 00:30:11.977 region:rollup2
TO THE FISH ACUTE TEST.

00:30:10.609 --> 00:30:13.345 region:rollup2
THESE EFFORTS REVEALED A STRONG

00:30:11.977 --> 00:30:15.247 region:rollup2
CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TWO

00:30:13.345 --> 00:30:16.882 region:rollup2
TESTS INDICATING THE POTENTIAL

00:30:15.247 --> 00:30:17.416 region:rollup2
FOR EMBRYOS TO BE UTILIZED IN

00:30:16.882 --> 00:30:19.818 region:rollup2
PLACE OF JUVENILE OR ADULT

00:30:17.416 --> 00:30:21.119 region:rollup2
FETCH.

00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:23.221 region:rollup2
I SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:24.790 region:rollup2
ALLOWS THE TT AS SEAT TO ASK AND

00:30:23.221 --> 00:30:25.957 region:rollup2
ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHETHER

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:27.292 region:rollup2
THESE TO TEST TYPES.

00:30:25.957 --> 00:30:27.459 region:rollup2
WHICH INCLUDES THE FISH EMBRYO

00:30:27.292 --> 00:30:29.428 region:rollup2
TO.

00:30:27.459 --> 00:30:30.495 region:rollup2
TOXICITY TEST CAN MEET THE

00:30:29.428 --> 00:30:32.097 region:rollup2
DEMANDS OF THEIR HAZARDOUS WASTE

00:30:30.495 --> 00:30:33.699 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.

00:30:32.097 --> 00:30:34.933 region:rollup2
IN MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION THAT

00:30:33.699 --> 00:30:36.501 region:rollup2
YOU TEST OF THE POTENTIAL TO

00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:37.369 region:rollup2
MEET THEIR NEEDS ENSURING THE

00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:39.104 region:rollup2
PROTECTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL

00:30:37.369 --> 00:30:40.706 region:rollup2
HEALTH WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY

00:30:39.104 --> 00:30:41.640 region:rollup2
ENHANCING THE WELFARE OF ANIMALS

00:30:40.706 --> 00:30:45.143 region:rollup2
UTILIZED IN THE ASSOCIATED

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:48.547 region:rollup2
TOXICITY.

00:30:45.143 --> 00:30:49.748 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND OUR FINAL WITNESS.

PLACED ON THAT LIST.

00:40:56.187 --> 00:40:59.424 region:rollup2
AMONG OTHER REASONS BECAUSE

THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.

00:40:59.424 --> 00:41:01.526 region:rollup2

AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN

00:41:14.939 --> 00:41:18.242 region:rollup2
STARTED OUT AS A BAND ON LEAD

00:41:16.941 --> 00:41:18.810 region:rollup2

00:41:18.242 --> 00:41:19.944 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE STILL HAS

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:21.245 region:rollup2
BEEN.

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:22.847 region:rollup2
NO RESEARCH IN CALIFORNIA THAT

00:41:21.245 --> 00:41:24.882 region:rollup2
POINTS TO LEAD FISHING WEIGHTS

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:25.950 region:rollup2
AND SINKERS IS HAVING A NEGATIVE

00:41:24.882 --> 00:41:28.586 region:rollup2
IMPACT THAN ANY WILDLIFE

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:30.021 region:rollup2
POPULATION. IN CALIFORNIA.

00:41:28.586 --> 00:41:31.856 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN IS

00:41:30.021 --> 00:41:33.925 region:rollup2
A BAN ON LEAD WEIGHTS AND

00:41:31.856 --> 00:41:35.827 region:rollup2
SINKERS. ALSO GENERATED NOW

00:41:33.925 --> 00:41:37.929 region:rollup2
OUTPOURING OF OPPOSITION AS YOU

00:41:35.827 --> 00:41:38.997 region:rollup2
CAN SEE FROM YOUR ANALYSIS AS

00:41:37.929 --> 00:41:40.999 region:rollup2
WELL AS THE FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED

00:41:38.997 --> 00:41:42.200 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ANGLERS WHO SIGN THE

00:41:40.999 --> 00:41:43.835 region:rollup2
ONLINE PETITION. OPPOSING THE

BAN.

00:41:43.835 --> 00:41:46.738 region:rollup2
IN OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

00:41:45.136 --> 00:41:48.639 region:rollup2
AUTHOR HE BROACHED THE IDEA OF A

00:41:46.738 --> 00:41:50.074 region:rollup2
RESEARCH STUDY. TO IDENTIFY

00:41:48.639 --> 00:41:51.743 region:rollup2
WHERE PROBLEM MAY EXIST IN

00:41:50.074 --> 00:41:53.144 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TO WILDLIFE.

00:41:51.743 --> 00:41:55.046 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE THE USE OF LEAD

00:41:53.144 --> 00:41:56.514 region:rollup2
WEIGHTS AND SINKERS.

00:41:55.046 --> 00:41:58.649 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO NOT OBJECT TO SUCH A

00:41:56.514 --> 00:42:00.785 region:rollup2
RESEARCH STUDY THE PARAMETERS OF

00:41:58.649 --> 00:42:01.986 region:rollup2
STUDY MUST BE WELL DEFINED?

00:42:00.785 --> 00:42:03.755 region:rollup2
PAN AND LIMITED WE BELIEVE TO

00:42:01.986 --> 00:42:05.823 region:rollup2
THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON

00:42:03.755 --> 00:42:07.925 region:rollup2
WILDLIFE POPULATIONS FROM THE

00:42:05.823 --> 00:42:09.627 region:rollup2
USE OF LEAD WEIGHTS AND SINKERS.

00:42:07.925 --> 00:42:11.562 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE CONTINUE O OPPOSE

00:42:09.627 --> 00:42:12.930 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN AS

00:42:11.562 --> 00:42:14.632 region:rollup2
IT IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED

MANDATE UNDER DEPARTMENT FISH

00:42:17.935 --> 00:42:20.772 region:rollup2
AND WILDLIFE. AND BELIEVE IT'S A

00:42:19.437 --> 00:42:22.774 region:rollup2
SOURCE OF FUNDING SHOULD BE

00:42:20.772 --> 00:42:24.108 region:rollup2
INCLUDED IN THE BILL.

00:42:22.774 --> 00:42:26.511 region:rollup2

IMPACTS ON WILDLIFE POPULATIONS

00:42:26.511 --> 00:42:30.581 region:rollup2
WHERE SUCH AN IMPACT MAY OCCUR.

00:42:29.147 --> 00:42:31.916 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT THE STUDY SHOULD

00:42:30.581 --> 00:42:33.451 region:rollup2
BE CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT

00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:35.353 region:rollup2
OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND NOT

00:42:33.451 --> 00:42:36.687 region:rollup2
CONTRACTED OUT.

00:42:35.353 --> 00:42:38.689 region:rollup2
TO WHAT MAY BE ULTIMATELY THE

00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:39.590 region:rollup2
LOWEST BIDDER.

00:42:38.689 --> 00:42:42.193 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT HAS AN

00:42:42.193 --> 00:42:45.930 region:rollup2
WHO WITH THE APPROPRIATE FUNDING

COULD MOST EFFECTIVELY STUDY THE

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:48.1000 region:rollup2
IMPACT OF LEAD AND FISHING

00:42:47.131 --> 00:42:50.268 region:rollup2
WEIGHTS? AND SINKERS ON WILDLIFE

ESPECIALLY TO CHILDREN.

00:58:25.736 --> 00:58:29.906 region:rollup2
AS I INDICATED EARLIER.

00:58:28.605 --> 00:58:31.208 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WILL PROTECT OUR

THE FOCUS ON QUITE THE STATE

00:59:20.757 --> 00:59:23.894 region:rollup2
WHICH IS MY AREA OF EXPERTISE

00:59:22.259 --> 00:59:25.028 region:rollup2
WHICH I'VE BEEN STUDYING FOR

00:59:23.894 --> 00:59:26.096 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWELVE YEARS.

00:59:25.028 --> 00:59:28.231 region:rollup2
THIS BOOK IS BASED ON MY

00:59:26.096 --> 00:59:29.099 region:rollup2
PATIENTS MOSTLY MARIN COUNTY AND

00:59:28.231 --> 00:59:31.001 region:rollup2
THE SOME OF THE SURROUNDING

00:59:29.099 --> 00:59:32.469 region:rollup2
AREAS. AND AS YOU ALREADY KNOW

00:59:31.001 --> 00:59:35.138 region:rollup2
MARIN COUNTY IS THE EIGHTH

00:59:32.469 --> 00:59:36.606 region:rollup2
WEALTHIEST COUNTY IN THE U. S.

00:59:35.138 --> 00:59:38.542 region:rollup2
SO I'M TAKING CARE VERY AFFLUENT

00:59:36.606 --> 00:59:40.110 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WHO HAVE ACCESS TO

00:59:38.542 --> 00:59:41.244 region:rollup2
MEANS. NOW THERE ARE EIGHT

00:59:40.110 --> 00:59:42.612 region:rollup2
COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF

00:59:41.244 --> 00:59:45.182 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THAT DON'T HAVE

00:59:42.612 --> 00:59:47.684 region:rollup2
ACCESS SUCH AS FRESNO MERCED

00:59:45.182 --> 00:59:49.453 region:rollup2
CURRENT TO OUR IMPERIAL MERCED

00:59:47.684 --> 00:59:51.188 region:rollup2
ON LAKE IT CETERA. AND THESE

00:59:49.453 --> 00:59:53.323 region:rollup2
COUNTIES HAVE HIGH RATES OF A

00:59:51.188 --> 00:59:54.057 region:rollup2
SPRING BOTH IN THE AGRICULTURAL

00:59:53.323 --> 00:59:55.725 region:rollup2
FIELD.

00:59:54.057 --> 00:59:57.127 region:rollup2
PARENTS BRINGING THE SPRING

00:59:55.725 --> 00:59:58.528 region:rollup2
HOME TO CHILDREN AND THE

00:59:57.127 --> 00:59:59.996 region:rollup2
CHILDREN ARE ADDITIONALLY BEING

00:59:58.528 --> 01:00:01.731 region:rollup2
SPRAYED AT SCHOOL. THIS

00:59:59.996 --> 01:00:02.766 region:rollup2
POPULATION IS MOSTLY LATINO AND

01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:04.935 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:06.736 region:rollup2
RATES OF ILLNESS IN THE STATE

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:07.771 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE GOOD SCIENTIFIC DATA

01:00:06.736 --> 01:00:09.072 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING THAT.

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:10.140 region:rollup2
SO THEN THERE BECOMES AN ISSUE

01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:11.741 region:rollup2
ABOUT OR CULTURAL AND

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:13.310 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL JUSTICE AS WELL

01:00:11.741 --> 01:00:14.945 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ONE OF MY CONCERNS I

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:16.646 region:rollup2
BRING FOR WHICH THIS COMMITTEE.

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:18.748 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOOK BACK AT THE WORK OF

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:20.383 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MARTUCCI AND WHAT

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:21.751 region:rollup2
HAPPENED IN HIS CHILD'S SCHOOL

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:23.487 region:rollup2
WITH THAT WE KNOW THAT EVEN

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:24.855 region:rollup2
SINGLE SPRING OF ACUTE SPRING

01:00:23.487 --> 01:00:27.290 region:rollup2
CAN CAUSE LONG TERM SQUARELY IN

01:00:24.855 --> 01:00:28.725 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR CANCERS. CANCERS TAKE

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:30.393 region:rollup2
A LONG TIME DEVELOP AT AS UP AS

01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:32.129 region:rollup2
HIGH AS TWO DECADES.

01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:33.196 region:rollup2
SO NOBODY WILL ABLE TO OF ANY OF

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:34.431 region:rollup2
THOSE KIDS WHO WERE SPRAYED GO

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:35.966 region:rollup2
ON TO DEVELOP NON HODGKINS

01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:37.901 region:rollup2
LYMPHOMA WHEN THE HIGHEST

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:39.970 region:rollup2
CANCERS IN OF PEOPLE TODAY AS

01:00:37.901 --> 01:00:41.171 region:rollup2
WELL AS YOUR DOG. THEN NOBODY IS

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:42.606 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THIS

01:00:41.171 --> 01:00:43.640 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE

01:00:42.606 --> 01:00:45.742 region:rollup2
CANCERS AND.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:48.011 region:rollup2
EARLIER SPRING AND NOBODY'S

01:00:45.742 --> 01:00:49.980 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THAT DATA BETWEEN

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:50.847 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS PRAYING AND PRESENT.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.481 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS NOTHING GOING ON

01:00:50.847 --> 01:00:53.617 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:56.286 region:rollup2
THE WE WERE BEFORE THE

01:00:53.617 --> 01:00:56.286 region:rollup2
EDUCATION COMMITTEE THEY MADE

01:00:56.353 --> 01:01:00.023 region:rollup2
REGARDING LEAST TOXIC.

01:00:57.787 --> 01:01:02.459 region:rollup2
PESTICIDES TO BE USED IN

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:04.060 region:rollup2
CHILDREN'S SCHOOLS AND WE HAVE

01:01:02.459 --> 01:01:06.162 region:rollup2
PUT FORWARD TO THIS COMMITTEES

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:07.631 region:rollup2
LEAST TOXIC EXPERT ON PESTICIDES

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:09.332 region:rollup2

01:01:07.631 --> 01:01:11.434 region:rollup2
USED SUCCESSFULLY IN IRVINE

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:13.003 region:rollup2
COUNTY. WAS A TREMENDOUS OF

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:14.771 region:rollup2
REDUCTION IN COSTS AND WATER

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:10.193 region:rollup2
GIVE US MORE INFORMATION NOW ON

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:12.362 region:rollup2
HOW WE'RE DOING AND TO MAKE A

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:14.898 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:17.066 region:rollup2
WHETHER CLOCK STATE OR ANY OTHER

01:07:14.898 --> 01:07:19.469 region:rollup2
PET SITE SHOULD BE BANNED.

01:07:17.066 --> 01:07:22.839 region:rollup2
SO I GUESS IT'S IT'S TWO PARTS

01:07:19.469 --> 01:07:24.107 region:rollup2
ONE IS TO EVALUATE.

01:07:22.839 --> 01:07:25.575 region:rollup2
ON THE EFFECTS OF LEGISLATION

01:07:24.107 --> 01:07:27.610 region:rollup2
WAS PREVIOUSLY PASSED RIGHT WITH

01:07:25.575 --> 01:07:29.112 region:rollup2
THAT INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:31.781 region:rollup2
PLAN. AND THEN THE SECOND PART

01:07:29.112 --> 01:07:32.715 region:rollup2
WOULD BE TO IDENTIFY WHICH

01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:34.918 region:rollup2
PESTICIDES.

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:36.953 region:rollup2
.

01:07:34.918 --> 01:07:37.787 region:rollup2
THEY THINK SHOULD BE BANNED IN

01:07:36.953 --> 01:07:38.955 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN DOING THAT

01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:41.491 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES THEY WOULD BRING IT

01:07:38.955 --> 01:07:42.592 region:rollup2
TO THE LEGISLATURE. TO.

01:07:41.491 --> 01:07:44.727 region:rollup2
THAT'S ARKWRIGHT IT WOULD ADD

01:07:42.592 --> 01:07:45.995 region:rollup2
THAT THIS BILL CALLS FOR THE DPR

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:48.131 region:rollup2
TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE

01:07:45.995 --> 01:07:49.165 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AS TO WHETHER ONE OR

01:07:48.131 --> 01:07:52.101 region:rollup2
MORE. PESTICIDES SHOULD BE TODAY

01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:54.037 region:rollup2
SO.

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:55.705 region:rollup2
HERE'S MY CONCERN WITH THIS

01:07:54.037 --> 01:07:57.040 region:rollup2
BILL BECAUSE RIGHT I HAVE KIDS

01:07:55.705 --> 01:07:59.275 region:rollup2
AT SCHOOL TOO SO.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:00.843 region:rollup2
I'D DEFINITELY SHARE THE

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:02.378 region:rollup2
CONCERN OF THEM GOING TO SCHOOL

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:03.880 region:rollup2
AND PLAYING IN THE FIELD. MY

01:08:02.378 --> 01:08:05.415 region:rollup2
BOYS RIGHT NOW ARE PLAYING FLAG

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:06.082 region:rollup2
FOOTBALL IN P. E. AND THEY'RE

01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:08.051 region:rollup2
ALL OVER THE PLACE IN THE GRASS.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:09.485 region:rollup2
.

01:08:08.051 --> 01:08:10.687 region:rollup2
SO I GET IT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:11.254 region:rollup2
WHAT YOUR KIDS COMING HOME WITH

01:08:10.687 --> 01:08:14.023 region:rollup2
ANY STORE SORTS OF REACTIONS

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:16.192 region:rollup2
NAM.

01:08:14.023 --> 01:08:18.528 region:rollup2
BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT THE

01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:21.130 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IS BEING ASKED TO

01:08:18.528 --> 01:08:23.166 region:rollup2
STEP IN AND DO THE JOB OF DP ARE

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:25.001 region:rollup2
WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE. THAT

01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:26.269 region:rollup2
THEY IDENTIFY THEM THE

01:08:25.001 --> 01:08:28.204 region:rollup2
PESTICIDES OR CHEMICALS THAT

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:29.672 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE BANNED BECAUSE THEN I

01:08:28.204 --> 01:08:31.207 region:rollup2
FEEL.

01:08:29.672 --> 01:08:31.441 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET ON THE

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:35.111 region:rollup2
ROAD OF.

01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:37.513 region:rollup2
.

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:39.882 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE BEING LOBBIED TO

01:08:37.513 --> 01:08:42.085 region:rollup2
TO BAN THIS TO ALLOW THAT WHICH

01:08:39.882 --> 01:08:43.686 region:rollup2
CAN GET VERY MESSY AND REALLY

01:08:42.085 --> 01:08:45.555 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T. BE SOMETHING THAT WE

01:08:43.686 --> 01:08:48.191 region:rollup2
ARE DECIDING ON THAT'S WHY WE

01:08:45.555 --> 01:08:49.525 region:rollup2
HAVE DP ARE GREAT IS WE PUT IT

01:08:48.191 --> 01:08:50.693 region:rollup2
IN THEIR HANDS AND SAY OKAY THIS

01:08:49.525 --> 01:08:52.829 region:rollup2
IS YOUR JOB YOUR YOUR

01:08:50.693 --> 01:08:54.230 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES. AND YOU NEED

01:08:52.829 --> 01:08:56.566 region:rollup2
NOT THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT THEN

01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:58.067 region:rollup2
PERHAPS WE NEED TO RE EVALUATE.

01:08:56.566 --> 01:08:59.369 region:rollup2
HOW THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB OR

01:08:58.067 --> 01:09:00.637 region:rollup2
WHAT AUTHORITY THEY HAVE BUT

01:08:59.369 --> 01:09:02.205 region:rollup2
THAT'S MY CONCERN?

01:09:00.637 --> 01:09:03.973 region:rollup2
WHICH AND I'M SURE YOU

01:09:02.205 --> 01:09:05.274 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IT'S IN WHERE WE

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:06.909 region:rollup2
STEPPING OVER THE LINE.

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:08.578 region:rollup2
.

01:09:06.909 --> 01:09:09.679 region:rollup2
IN AND WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S

01:09:08.578 --> 01:09:12.382 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY.

01:09:09.679 --> 01:09:14.650 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE IN CASES LIKE THIS.

01:09:12.382 --> 01:09:16.119 region:rollup2
WELL AND AND IN RESPONSE AYE

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:17.320 region:rollup2
YEAH AYE.

01:09:16.119 --> 01:09:20.123 region:rollup2
HERE WHICH SANG OF I I THINK

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:21.824 region:rollup2
IT'S A.

01:09:20.123 --> 01:09:23.126 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT IT WOULD BE. I

01:09:21.824 --> 01:09:24.727 region:rollup2
BELIEVE A MORE THOUGHTFUL

01:09:23.126 --> 01:09:26.429 region:rollup2
APPROACH IF THE.

01:09:24.727 --> 01:09:28.531 region:rollup2
THE SCIENTISTS AND EXPERTS AT

01:09:26.429 --> 01:09:30.166 region:rollup2
THE DPR MAKE THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:31.434 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE CAN DECIDE.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:33.069 region:rollup2
WHETHER IN FACT HIM IS HE TAKE

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:34.504 region:rollup2
THE NEXT STEP OF OF BANNING THE

01:09:33.069 --> 01:09:34.704 region:rollup2
PEST SIDE.

01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:36.072 region:rollup2
AND.

01:09:34.704 --> 01:09:37.774 region:rollup2
.

01:09:36.072 --> 01:09:39.242 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE VIEW WHEN I HAVE

01:09:37.774 --> 01:09:40.810 region:rollup2
KIDS PLAYING ON THESE FIELDS I I

01:09:39.242 --> 01:09:42.345 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S NOT JUST.

01:09:40.810 --> 01:09:43.913 region:rollup2
VIA THE THE SKINNER AYE

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:44.847 region:rollup2
IRRITATIONS THAT WE'RE CONCERNED

01:09:43.913 --> 01:09:46.215 region:rollup2
ABOUT BUT WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE

01:09:44.847 --> 01:09:47.617 region:rollup2
LIKE TO SAY.

01:09:46.215 --> 01:09:49.285 region:rollup2
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION

01:09:47.617 --> 01:09:50.920 region:rollup2
HAS A.

01:09:49.285 --> 01:09:52.822 region:rollup2
DESIGNATED AS A.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.923 region:rollup2
AS THE COURT CARCINOGEN.

01:09:52.822 --> 01:09:56.592 region:rollup2
AND.

01:09:53.923 --> 01:09:57.560 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT. OUR KIDS TO BE

01:09:56.592 --> 01:09:59.896 region:rollup2
EXPOSED TO CANCER CAUSING

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:02.331 region:rollup2
CHEMICALS AND SO I THINK THIS IS

01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:03.966 region:rollup2
A RESPONSIBLE LOWER. I EFFORT TO

01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:06.069 region:rollup2
TO FIRST TO.

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:06.335 region:rollup2
TAKE BEYOND THAT TO HAVE THE DPR

01:10:06.069 --> 01:10:07.937 region:rollup2
EVALUATE.

01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:09.772 region:rollup2
.

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:11.340 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE STATUS OF A PATH

01:10:09.772 --> 01:10:13.076 region:rollup2
SIDE MANAGEMENT AT OUR SCHOOLS

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:14.343 region:rollup2
AND AND AND TO DO.

01:10:13.076 --> 01:10:15.445 region:rollup2
PACIFIC WE MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:10:14.343 --> 01:10:17.513 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN DECIDE WHETHER TO

01:10:15.445 --> 01:10:19.482 region:rollup2
TAKE ACTION ON.

01:10:17.513 --> 01:10:21.451 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU BY ANY CHANCE HAD ANY

01:10:19.482 --> 01:10:23.319 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WITH ANYONE IT DPR

01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:25.188 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE FACT THAT.

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:26.255 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME PESTICIDES DID

01:10:25.188 --> 01:10:27.790 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE AND OTHER

01:10:26.255 --> 01:10:29.292 region:rollup2

.

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:35.832 region:rollup2
USES THAT ARE ALLOWED.

01:10:32.929 --> 01:10:37.100 region:rollup2
I BUT I HAVE NOT TO HAD DIRECT

01:10:35.832 --> 01:10:38.601 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS I KNOW MY STAFF

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:40.069 region:rollup2
HAS BUT TO.

01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:41.404 region:rollup2
AGAIN THERE THIS BILL WOULD

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:42.805 region:rollup2
ALLOW THE P. R. TO MAKE

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:44.841 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS TO US AS TO

01:10:42.805 --> 01:10:46.442 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT. A WE SHOULD BE

01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:48.778 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING BANNING THOSE

01:10:46.442 --> 01:10:50.980 region:rollup2
SPECIFIES THAT YOU'RE FOR INTO.

01:10:48.778 --> 01:10:55.118 region:rollup2
OKAY WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:57.153 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATED WITH DP OURS LACK OF.

ACTION.

01:10:57.153 --> 01:10:59.789 region:rollup2
M. MIGHT BE A WAY YOU DON'T HAVE

01:10:58.221 --> 01:11:01.591 region:rollup2
TO YOU KNOW.

SAY THAT YOURSELF WHICH IS HOW I

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:03.760 region:rollup2
SEE IT BUT MIGHT BE. THE

01:11:03.159 --> 01:11:04.694 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE WAY TO CATEGORIZE

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:08.531 region:rollup2
IT.

01:11:04.694 --> 01:11:11.100 region:rollup2
I JUST.

01:11:08.531 --> 01:11:12.969 region:rollup2
I AGREE WITH. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:14.504 region:rollup2
THAT WE SHOULD BE VERY CONCERNED

01:11:12.969 --> 01:11:16.205 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE USE OF SOME OF THESE

01:11:14.504 --> 01:11:18.241 region:rollup2
CHEMICALS MY PROBLEM IS?

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:19.609 region:rollup2
PUTTING IT IN THE LEGISLATURE'S

01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:21.144 region:rollup2

MORE PUT PRESSURE PLOT APPLIED

01:11:21.144 --> 01:11:25.748 region:rollup2
TO DPR. TO DO WHAT THEY HAVE

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:26.015 region:rollup2

KEEP THEM IN PLACE BUT FOR THE

01:11:29.352 --> 01:11:32.021 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO TAKE ON THEIR

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:33.356 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY THERE'S NO POINT

01:11:32.021 --> 01:11:36.425 region:rollup2
HAVING THEM THERE THAT ARE GOING

BEING ABLE TO CONSOLIDATE THESE

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:12.461 region:rollup2

RATE PAYERS WHO HAVE TO ASSUME

01:22:14.029 --> 01:22:18.167 region:rollup2

WHEREVER IT'S COMING FROM.

01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:29.344 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST IS THERE A GUARANTEE

01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:31.280 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S NOT AND I AM FROM

01:22:29.344 --> 01:22:34.349 region:rollup2
HARRY. I BELIEVE TO DAY I I'M

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:35.684 region:rollup2
SURE THERE IS A CURRENT THAT THE

01:22:34.349 --> 01:22:36.752 region:rollup2
STATE REVOLVING FUND.

01:22:35.684 --> 01:22:39.254 region:rollup2
AND IF BROWN'S A THE BOND OF

01:22:36.752 --> 01:22:41.223 region:rollup2
PROCEEDS PROPOSITION ONE COULD

01:22:39.254 --> 01:22:42.558 region:rollup2
ALSO A BLUE COVER SOME OF THE

01:22:41.223 --> 01:22:44.726 region:rollup2
COST. AND I'M SURE THE

01:22:42.558 --> 01:22:46.829 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION SIXTY A CURRENTLY ON

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:48.831 region:rollup2
THE BALLOT IT WILL IT COULD BE A

01:22:46.829 --> 01:22:50.566 region:rollup2
ANOTHER POTENTIAL A FUNDING

01:22:48.831 --> 01:22:51.967 region:rollup2
SOURCE.

01:22:50.566 --> 01:22:54.636 region:rollup2
SO THERE OF SOME A REVOLVING

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:56.104 region:rollup2
FUND AVAILABLE TODAY. OKAY I'M

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:59.675 region:rollup2
WOULD THEIR REPRESENTATIVE FROM

01:22:56.104 --> 01:23:00.008 region:rollup2
AQUA COME BACK UP HERE. JUSTIN.

01:22:59.675 --> 01:23:00.843 region:rollup2
ALSO PROVIDER.

01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:05.814 region:rollup2
.

01:23:00.843 --> 01:23:07.449 region:rollup2
RESPONSE TO THE.

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:09.384 region:rollup2
BOB I JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT

01:23:07.449 --> 01:23:10.052 region:rollup2
AGAIN THIS IS FOR CONNECTIONS A

01:23:09.384 --> 01:23:12.020 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN OR LESS.

01:23:10.052 --> 01:23:13.722 region:rollup2
YEAH.

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:15.891 region:rollup2
SO FROM FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

01:23:13.722 --> 01:23:18.760 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW DOES ALLOW A WATER

01:23:15.891 --> 01:23:20.629 region:rollup2
SYSTEM TO. RECOVER COSTS THROUGH

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.865 region:rollup2
THE RATEPAYERS OF CHARGING.

01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:24.199 region:rollup2
WITH THE RATEPAYERS THAT WERE

01:23:22.865 --> 01:23:25.234 region:rollup2
SUBSUMED AND IN THIS NEW SYSTEM

01:23:24.199 --> 01:23:27.035 region:rollup2
CHARGING THEM FOR THE COST OF

01:23:25.234 --> 01:23:28.537 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION THIS BILL WOULD

01:23:27.035 --> 01:23:30.138 region:rollup2
PROHIBIT THAT.

01:23:28.537 --> 01:23:31.373 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO ENSURE IS

01:23:30.138 --> 01:23:32.875 region:rollup2
THAT IF THE STATE WATER BOARD

01:23:31.373 --> 01:23:34.743 region:rollup2
DOES INDEED HAVE FUNDING FOR

01:23:32.875 --> 01:23:36.144 region:rollup2
THIS THAT THEY DO PAY FOR THAT.

01:23:34.743 --> 01:23:38.881 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT THE WATER SYSTEM

01:23:36.144 --> 01:23:40.015 region:rollup2
HAS TO JUST ABSORB IT SO. FOR US

01:23:38.881 --> 01:23:41.383 region:rollup2
I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:41.817 region:rollup2
SOME FUN THERE SOME FUNDS

01:23:41.383 --> 01:23:43.652 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FOR THIS.

01:23:41.817 --> 01:23:44.553 region:rollup2
.

01:23:43.652 --> 01:23:45.787 region:rollup2
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY

01:23:44.553 --> 01:23:47.122 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATIONS THERE HAVE BEEN

01:23:45.787 --> 01:23:48.457 region:rollup2
MANDATED BY THE WATER BOARD I

01:23:47.122 --> 01:23:50.792 region:rollup2
THINK BECAUSE FUNDING HAS BEEN

01:23:48.457 --> 01:23:53.061 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO COME BY. SO.

01:23:50.792 --> 01:23:54.196 region:rollup2
FOR US AT LEAST WE WANT SOME

01:23:53.061 --> 01:23:56.064 region:rollup2
STRONG LANGUAGE IN THAT IT SAYS

01:23:54.196 --> 01:23:56.465 region:rollup2
THE STATE WATER BOARD SHALL.

01:23:56.064 --> 01:23:58.166 region:rollup2
COVER THE COSTS OF

01:23:56.465 --> 01:23:59.835 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION.

01:23:58.166 --> 01:24:01.336 region:rollup2
AND IS THERE ANY INTENTION ON

01:23:59.835 --> 01:24:03.839 region:rollup2
YOUR PART MISTER CHIU TO ARAB

01:24:01.336 --> 01:24:05.140 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE LIKE THAT OR PERHAPS

01:24:03.839 --> 01:24:08.677 region:rollup2
AND GOOD TO BAYLISS IS AT THE

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:10.379 region:rollup2
STATE'S GOOD NOW. OF WOODEN NAM

01:24:08.677 --> 01:24:11.914 region:rollup2
MANDATE THE CONSOLIDATION.

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:14.283 region:rollup2
WATER BOY Y. NOW MANDATED TO

CONSOLIDATION ALASKA OR TO

01:24:14.283 --> 01:24:18.487 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE FUNDING SOLD IT WOULD

01:24:16.184 --> 01:24:19.888 region:rollup2
DO HOW BIRD.

01:24:18.487 --> 01:24:21.623 region:rollup2
TAKE THAT APPROACH TO MAKE SURE

01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:24.059 region:rollup2
THAT THE FUNDING TO STARE.

01:24:21.623 --> 01:24:26.395 region:rollup2

I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THIS OUT.

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:45.614 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT AQUA HAS GOOD

01:24:43.679 --> 01:24:47.282 region:rollup2
REASONS FOR ASKING FOR STRONGER

01:24:45.614 --> 01:24:49.051 region:rollup2

DEVELOPING STORM WATER PERMITS.

01:29:47.882 --> 01:29:50.218 region:rollup2
UNDER EXISTING FEDERAL LAW THE

01:29:48.683 --> 01:29:51.753 region:rollup2
CLEAN WATER ACT REGULATES

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:53.521 region:rollup2
DISCHARGES OF POLLUTANTS INTO

01:29:59.027 --> 01:30:03.531 region:rollup2
UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW THE PORTER

01:30:00.862 --> 01:30:05.133 region:rollup2
COLOGNE. A WATER QUALITY ACT

01:30:03.531 --> 01:30:06.935 region:rollup2
PROHIBITS THE DISCHARGE OF

01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:08.970 region:rollup2
POLLUTANTS A TO SURFACE WATER

01:30:06.935 --> 01:30:09.537 region:rollup2
UNLESS THE DISCHARGE OBTAINS A

01:30:11.206 --> 01:30:14.142 region:rollup2
I MISS FOR STORM WATER PERMITS

01:30:12.741 --> 01:30:15.543 region:rollup2
ARE CRITICAL FOR PROTECTING

01:30:14.142 --> 01:30:17.212 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE

THE LA AREA.

01:32:01.549 --> 01:32:05.420 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY EIGHT IS

01:32:03.218 --> 01:32:06.388 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO AFFORD FLEXIBILITY

01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:08.523 region:rollup2
TO EXTEND THE TIMELINE FOR

01:32:08.523 --> 01:32:11.192 region:rollup2
WITH STORMWATER PERMITS BASED ON

TO SEE A CITIES DEMONSTRATED

01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:14.462 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL NEED SO THAT'S WHAT

01:32:13.495 --> 01:32:17.132 region:rollup2
THIS IS ABOUT THAT'S WHAT I SEE

01:32:14.462 --> 01:32:17.699 region:rollup2
IS ABOUT. MANY LA COUNTY CITIES

01:32:17.132 --> 01:32:20.568 region:rollup2

01:32:17.699 --> 01:32:21.970 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES EXCEED SEVERAL HUNDRED

01:32:20.568 --> 01:32:24.105 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS.

01:32:21.970 --> 01:32:25.240 region:rollup2
THESE HIGH COSTS ARE SPECIALLY

01:32:24.105 --> 01:32:26.474 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING FOR THE

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:28.009 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED COMMITTEES WITHIN

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:29.477 region:rollup2
THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY.

01:32:28.009 --> 01:32:31.046 region:rollup2
THOSE COMMITTEES OUR ALREADY

01:32:29.477 --> 01:32:33.515 region:rollup2
STRUGGLE TO PROVIDE BASIC

01:32:31.046 --> 01:32:34.682 region:rollup2
MUNICIPAL SERVICES.

01:32:33.515 --> 01:32:37.118 region:rollup2
AND CALIFORNIA CITIES IN SINGLE

01:32:34.682 --> 01:32:37.652 region:rollup2
VALLEY CITIES ARE NOT ALONE IN

01:32:37.118 --> 01:32:39.554 region:rollup2
FACING THESE EXTRAORDINARY

01:32:37.652 --> 01:32:40.755 region:rollup2
COSTS.

01:32:39.554 --> 01:32:43.291 region:rollup2
WELL THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT'S

01:32:40.755 --> 01:32:44.325 region:rollup2
REPEATED ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

01:32:43.291 --> 01:32:46.161 region:rollup2
AND IN RESPONSE TO THIS

01:32:44.325 --> 01:32:47.929 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE THE EPA IN TWO

01:32:46.161 --> 01:32:50.098 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FOURTEEN RELEASED.

01:32:47.929 --> 01:32:51.866 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT

01:32:50.098 --> 01:32:52.734 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK SO THE EPA HAS FCA

01:32:51.866 --> 01:32:54.936 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES.

01:32:52.734 --> 01:32:55.870 region:rollup2
.

01:32:54.936 --> 01:32:57.772 region:rollup2
IF IT IS A LITTLE BIT

01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:59.974 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED BUT THEIR STAFF IS

01:32:57.772 --> 01:33:01.709 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED IT AS PROVIDING

01:32:59.974 --> 01:33:03.912 region:rollup2
REGULATORS WITH THE FLEXIBILITY

01:33:01.709 --> 01:33:06.481 region:rollup2
TO CONSIDER. A MUNICIPAL PERMIT

01:33:03.912 --> 01:33:08.583 region:rollup2
TEASE ABILITY TO PAY FOR AND

01:33:06.481 --> 01:33:10.685 region:rollup2
DELIVER WATER SERVICES.

01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:12.087 region:rollup2
IT CONSIDERS VARIOUS MEASURES

01:33:10.685 --> 01:33:14.522 region:rollup2
SUCH AS HOUSE A HOUSEHOLDS

01:33:12.087 --> 01:33:16.357 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO PAY FOR THE TOTALITY.

01:33:14.522 --> 01:33:17.792 region:rollup2
OF WATER RELATED COSTS.

01:33:16.357 --> 01:33:19.160 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITIES

01:33:17.792 --> 01:33:20.628 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL ABILITY TO DELIVER

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:22.397 region:rollup2
SERVICES BASED ON SEVERAL

01:33:20.628 --> 01:33:23.731 region:rollup2
FACTORS

01:33:22.397 --> 01:33:24.699 region:rollup2
SUCH AS THEIR DEBT BURDEN THEIR

01:33:23.731 --> 01:33:26.634 region:rollup2
DEMOGRAPHICS AND SOME OTHER

01:33:24.699 --> 01:33:29.370 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS.

01:33:26.634 --> 01:33:31.005 region:rollup2
REGARDING THE HOUSEHOLD COSTS.

01:33:29.370 --> 01:33:32.640 region:rollup2
NOW THE EPA RECOMMENDS CAPPING

01:33:31.005 --> 01:33:34.776 region:rollup2
WATER RELATED EXPENSES THAT THE

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:36.077 region:rollup2
TOTAL WATER RELATED EXPENSES AT

01:33:34.776 --> 01:33:38.379 region:rollup2
FOR A HALF PERCENT.

01:33:36.077 --> 01:33:40.048 region:rollup2
OF MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME.

01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:41.549 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IN

01:33:40.048 --> 01:33:43.184 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE US

01:33:41.549 --> 01:33:45.553 region:rollup2
CONFERENCE OF MAYORS.

01:33:43.184 --> 01:33:47.055 region:rollup2
CONDUCTED A STUDY AND FOUND

01:33:45.553 --> 01:33:49.057 region:rollup2
THAT ALMOST HALF OF SAN GABRIEL

01:33:47.055 --> 01:33:50.758 region:rollup2
VALLEY CITIES HAVE SOME

01:33:49.057 --> 01:33:52.427 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS THAT ARE PAYING MORE.

01:33:50.758 --> 01:33:54.562 region:rollup2
THAN THAT FOREIGN A HALF PERCENT

01:33:52.427 --> 01:33:55.864 region:rollup2
MHI FOR THEIR WATER AND IN SOME

01:33:54.562 --> 01:33:57.332 region:rollup2
CITIES IT WAS OVER TWENTY

01:33:55.864 --> 01:33:59.000 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF RESIDENTS THAT PAY

01:33:57.332 --> 01:34:01.035 region:rollup2
MORE THAN THAT SO.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.437 region:rollup2
SO A FIFTY THEIR POPULATION.

01:34:01.035 --> 01:34:03.371 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS JUST ONE REASON THAT

01:34:02.437 --> 01:34:04.472 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR AB

01:34:03.371 --> 01:34:06.241 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE.

01:34:04.472 --> 01:34:08.209 region:rollup2
THIRTY EIGHT.

01:34:06.241 --> 01:34:11.246 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE WATER BOARD TO

01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:13.748 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH FCA GUIDELINES AND TO

01:34:11.246 --> 01:34:15.216 region:rollup2
DEVELOP AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE

01:34:13.748 --> 01:34:17.519 region:rollup2
COSTS A MUNICIPALITIES BOTH

01:34:15.216 --> 01:34:20.321 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLDS AND CITIES.

01:34:17.519 --> 01:34:21.756 region:rollup2
FOR WATER RELATED COSTS.

01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:23.291 region:rollup2
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE STATE

01:34:21.756 --> 01:34:24.993 region:rollup2
BOARD AND THE LA REACH REPORTER

01:34:23.291 --> 01:34:27.662 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR USE THOSE GUIDELINES

01:34:24.993 --> 01:34:29.264 region:rollup2
IN THIS PILOT PROJECT.

01:34:27.662 --> 01:34:30.698 region:rollup2
COUNCIL MEMBER MAHMOUD WILL

01:34:29.264 --> 01:34:32.467 region:rollup2
FOLLOW WITH SOME ADDITIONAL AND

01:34:30.698 --> 01:34:34.002 region:rollup2
THOUGHTS ABOUT IF CA AND HOW CAN

01:34:32.467 --> 01:34:35.470 region:rollup2
HELP CITIES. BUT I SUBMIT THAT

01:34:34.002 --> 01:34:38.139 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY EIGHT

01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:39.774 region:rollup2
OFFERS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH.

I KNOW HOW.

01:58:12.352 --> 01:58:16.656 region:rollup2
UP IT ONLY REQUIRES NOTICE.

01:58:14.921 --> 01:58:19.125 region:rollup2
PERIOD IT TAKES NO DISCRETION

01:58:16.656 --> 01:58:21.962 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM THE LOCALS.

01:58:19.125 --> 01:58:23.330 region:rollup2
ARM FRANKLY IN HAYWARD WE ALWAYS

01:58:21.962 --> 01:58:25.665 region:rollup2
GAVE NOTICE TO PEOPLE WHO WERE

01:58:23.330 --> 01:58:27.701 region:rollup2
NEARBY PERIOD A LOT COMMUNITIES

01:58:25.665 --> 01:58:29.903 region:rollup2
DO THIS BUT SOME DON'T.

01:58:27.701 --> 01:58:31.438 region:rollup2
I WILL ALSO SAY THAT

01:58:29.903 --> 01:58:34.975 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES OF.

01:58:31.438 --> 01:58:36.977 region:rollup2
.

01:58:34.975 --> 01:58:39.512 region:rollup2
THAT ARE WELL ESTABLISHED.

01:58:36.977 --> 01:58:41.181 region:rollup2
ARM ART IN POVERTY TEND TO HAVE

01:58:39.512 --> 01:58:42.983 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATIONS HAVE

01:58:41.181 --> 01:58:44.551 region:rollup2
ASKED OFTEN.

01:58:42.983 --> 01:58:46.419 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POOR

01:58:44.551 --> 01:58:48.188 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

01:58:46.419 --> 01:58:49.756 region:rollup2
THAT MAY NOT HAVE SOMEONE IN

01:58:48.188 --> 01:58:51.958 region:rollup2
THAT COMMUNITY WHO HAS OPTED IN

01:58:49.756 --> 01:58:55.228 region:rollup2
TO GET THESE NOTICES.

01:58:51.958 --> 01:58:56.496 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS ALL THIS DOES AND.

01:58:55.228 --> 01:58:58.431 region:rollup2
AND THE OPPOSITION HER CAR

01:58:56.496 --> 01:58:58.999 region:rollup2
CORRECT ME BUT I BELIEVE THE

01:58:58.431 --> 01:59:00.266 region:rollup2
ONLY THING THEY'RE CONCERNED

01:58:58.999 --> 01:59:02.802 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:59:00.266 --> 01:59:05.505 region:rollup2
IS A BETTER DEFINITION.

01:59:02.802 --> 01:59:07.841 region:rollup2
OF. WHAT SORT OF FIRM?

01:59:05.505 --> 01:59:09.342 region:rollup2
?

01:59:07.841 --> 01:59:10.610 region:rollup2
PROJECTS WOULD REQUIRE THE

01:59:09.342 --> 01:59:12.646 region:rollup2
NOTICE IS THAT CORRECT.

01:59:10.610 --> 01:59:13.847 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:59:12.646 --> 01:59:16.049 region:rollup2
WHO DETERMINES WHAT A SUBJECT

01:59:13.847 --> 01:59:17.350 region:rollup2
LAND USE IS IS TO A STATE AGENCY

01:59:16.049 --> 01:59:18.918 region:rollup2
WE ARE AND THERE'S SOME

01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:20.453 region:rollup2
AMBIGUITY AS TO THE DIRECTION

01:59:18.918 --> 01:59:22.722 region:rollup2
THIS BILL PROVIDES TO A STATE

01:59:20.453 --> 01:59:24.324 region:rollup2
AGENCY SO? AS TO WHO GETS THE

01:59:22.722 --> 01:59:24.924 region:rollup2
NOTICES THERE'D WHAT IS

01:59:24.324 --> 01:59:26.192 region:rollup2
ENCOMPASSED UNDER SUBJECT LAND

01:59:24.924 --> 01:59:27.260 region:rollup2
USE.

01:59:26.192 --> 01:59:28.828 region:rollup2
THAT IS ALLOCATED NOW TO STATE

01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:30.997 region:rollup2
AGENCIES AS OPPOSED TO A LOCAL

01:59:28.828 --> 01:59:31.564 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS GOT AND MAYBE THAT

01:59:30.997 --> 01:59:34.034 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THE DIFFICULTY WE

01:59:31.564 --> 01:59:35.635 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:59:34.034 --> 01:59:38.304 region:rollup2
IS NOT EVERYONE DEFINES

01:59:35.635 --> 01:59:41.408 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIAL USES THE SAME WAY.

01:59:38.304 --> 01:59:43.109 region:rollup2
ARM A WAREHOUSE THAT HAS A LOT

01:59:41.408 --> 01:59:45.111 region:rollup2
OF TRUCKS COMING IN AND OUT.

01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:47.080 region:rollup2
ME NOT BE DEFINED AS INDUSTRIAL.

01:59:45.111 --> 01:59:49.749 region:rollup2
ARM.

01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:52.352 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY IF THE AUTHOR IS ABLE.

01:59:49.749 --> 01:59:54.688 region:rollup2
COME UP WITH A LIST OF USES

01:59:52.352 --> 01:59:56.356 region:rollup2
OUR THAT WOULD BE BEST.

01:59:54.688 --> 01:59:58.425 region:rollup2
ARM IF YOU CAN SUGGEST.

01:59:56.356 --> 02:00:00.427 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT WAY OF OF.

01:59:58.425 --> 02:00:02.429 region:rollup2
DEFINING KNEES WE WOULD

02:00:00.427 --> 02:00:05.598 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IT.

02:00:02.429 --> 02:00:07.333 region:rollup2
ARM AND THAT IT WOULD BE. BEST

02:00:05.598 --> 02:00:08.768 region:rollup2
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO TO A

02:00:07.333 --> 02:00:10.370 region:rollup2
STATE AGENCY TO FIND.

02:00:08.768 --> 02:00:13.006 region:rollup2
ARM AND THAT IS SOMETHING THE

02:00:10.370 --> 02:00:14.574 region:rollup2
AUTHOR I KNOW WANTS TO WORK ON.

02:00:13.006 --> 02:00:17.010 region:rollup2
STARTING YOUR HEAD YES.

02:00:14.574 --> 02:00:19.879 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WE WILL BE ABLE.

02:00:17.010 --> 02:00:22.048 region:rollup2
TO COME UP WITH A.

02:00:19.879 --> 02:00:23.583 region:rollup2
SATISFACTORY DEFINITION I HOPE

02:00:22.048 --> 02:00:25.385 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO A STATE

02:00:23.583 --> 02:00:27.320 region:rollup2
AGENCY BUT IF WE DO WILL MAKE

02:00:25.385 --> 02:00:28.621 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE HAVE GOOD LANGUAGE

02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:30.223 region:rollup2
AND WILL BE WORKING WITH THE

02:00:28.621 --> 02:00:30.690 region:rollup2
AUTHOR ON THAT.

02:00:30.223 --> 02:00:32.125 region:rollup2
AND.

02:00:30.690 --> 02:00:33.993 region:rollup2
AGAIN IF YOU SUGGEST A

02:00:32.125 --> 02:00:34.794 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AGENCY THAT'S

02:00:33.993 --> 02:00:37.330 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK

02:00:34.794 --> 02:00:38.398 region:rollup2
AT. BUT WE DON'T WANT SOMEBODY

02:00:37.330 --> 02:00:41.134 region:rollup2
TO AVOID.

02:00:38.398 --> 02:00:43.269 region:rollup2
THE NOTICE REQUIREMENT BY

02:00:41.134 --> 02:00:45.271 region:rollup2
SAYING ó THIS IS AN INDUSTRIAL

02:00:43.269 --> 02:00:46.473 region:rollup2
WITH SOMETHING ELSE AND THAT'S.

02:00:45.271 --> 02:00:49.209 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WE JUST

02:00:46.473 --> 02:00:50.643 region:rollup2
DIDN'T SAY INDUSTRIAL IN S. SO

02:00:49.209 --> 02:00:52.312 region:rollup2
IT'S A REAL PROBLEM AND IT'S

02:00:50.643 --> 02:00:52.679 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TIME TO

02:00:52.312 --> 02:00:54.013 region:rollup2
WORK ON AND IF.

02:00:52.679 --> 02:00:55.782 region:rollup2
.

02:00:54.013 --> 02:00:57.717 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH

02:00:55.782 --> 02:00:58.818 region:rollup2
US TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR I

02:00:57.717 --> 02:01:01.221 region:rollup2
HOPE WE CAN COME UP WITH A

02:00:58.818 --> 02:01:01.888 region:rollup2
SATISFACTORY SOLUTION.

02:01:01.221 --> 02:01:04.057 region:rollup2
SO.

02:01:01.888 --> 02:01:05.992 region:rollup2
I'M VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF THIS

02:01:04.057 --> 02:01:07.694 region:rollup2
AS I SAID SOME COMMUNITIES DO

02:01:05.992 --> 02:01:09.062 region:rollup2
THIS SOME DON'T.

02:01:07.694 --> 02:01:10.029 region:rollup2
I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN

02:01:09.062 --> 02:01:11.564 region:rollup2
AGAIN ALL WE'RE TALKING THAT AS

02:01:10.029 --> 02:01:13.600 region:rollup2
NOTICE

02:01:11.564 --> 02:01:14.601 region:rollup2
IF NO ONE WAS WORRIED ABOUT IT.

02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:16.402 region:rollup2
THERE WON'T EVEN BE AN IMPACT

02:01:14.601 --> 02:01:18.938 region:rollup2
AND IF PEOPLE ARE.

02:01:16.402 --> 02:01:19.405 region:rollup2
THEN AS SOMEONE SAID HERE THEY

02:01:18.938 --> 02:01:20.607 region:rollup2
BETTER LISTEN TO THEIR

02:01:19.405 --> 02:01:22.342 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS.

02:01:20.607 --> 02:01:24.577 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT.

02:01:22.342 --> 02:01:30.083 region:rollup2

CLOTHING MADE FROM SYNTHETIC

02:02:45.758 --> 02:02:48.795 region:rollup2
FABRICS DOMINATES THE CLOTHING

02:02:47.393 --> 02:02:50.330 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY AND AS A RESULT

02:02:48.795 --> 02:02:52.165 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE REGULARLY

02:02:50.330 --> 02:02:53.833 region:rollup2
WASH CLOTHES THAT ARE MADE OF

02:02:52.165 --> 02:02:55.602 region:rollup2
SYNTHETIC MATERIAL THE CLOTHING

02:02:53.833 --> 02:02:57.403 region:rollup2
I'M WEARING IS NO DIFFERENT IN

02:02:55.602 --> 02:02:59.505 region:rollup2
FACT. ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF

FABRIC PRODUCED IN THE TEXTILE

02:02:59.505 --> 02:03:03.343 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY IN TWENTY FOURTEEN

02:03:01.274 --> 02:03:05.044 region:rollup2
CONTAIN POLYESTER.

02:03:03.343 --> 02:03:07.513 region:rollup2
AND WASHING CLOTHING MADE FROM

02:03:05.044 --> 02:03:09.249 region:rollup2
THESE SYNTHETIC FABRICS.

02:03:07.513 --> 02:03:10.984 region:rollup2
WE NOW KNOW RELEASES PLASTIC

02:03:09.249 --> 02:03:13.353 region:rollup2
MICROFIBER IS THAT MAKE THEIR

02:03:10.984 --> 02:03:14.988 region:rollup2
WAY INTO OUR WATER AND THEREIN

02:03:13.353 --> 02:03:16.723 region:rollup2
LIES THE PROBLEM.

02:03:14.988 --> 02:03:18.458 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE REGIONAL

QUALITY IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY.

02:03:20.260 --> 02:03:24.931 region:rollup2
TESTED THE EFFLUENT OF EIGHT

02:03:22.862 --> 02:03:26.666 region:rollup2
WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS AND

02:03:24.931 --> 02:03:28.334 region:rollup2
FOUND THAT EIGHTY PERCENT.

02:03:26.666 --> 02:03:29.702 region:rollup2
OF THE MICRO PLASTICS THAT THEY

02:03:28.334 --> 02:03:32.071 region:rollup2
FOUND ANOTHER MICROSCOPIC

02:03:29.702 --> 02:03:33.940 region:rollup2
PARTICLES WERE IN FACT SMALL

02:03:32.071 --> 02:03:35.408 region:rollup2
FIBERS FROM CLOTHING.

02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:37.777 region:rollup2
EVERY TIME A FLEECE JACKET IS

02:03:35.408 --> 02:03:39.646 region:rollup2
WASHED IT RELEASES HUNDREDS IF

02:03:37.777 --> 02:03:40.914 region:rollup2
NOT THOUSANDS OF FIBERS AND TO

02:03:39.646 --> 02:03:42.882 region:rollup2
GET AN IDEA OF THE SCALE OF THIS

02:03:40.914 --> 02:03:44.751 region:rollup2
PROBLEM. THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC

02:03:42.882 --> 02:03:46.386 region:rollup2
RELEASED BY THE LAUNDERING OF

02:03:44.751 --> 02:03:49.489 region:rollup2
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FLEECE

02:03:46.386 --> 02:03:51.257 region:rollup2
JACKETS. IS EQUIVALENT TO UP TO

02:03:49.489 --> 02:03:52.825 region:rollup2
NEARLY TWELVE HUNDRED PLASTIC

02:03:51.257 --> 02:03:54.661 region:rollup2
GROCERY BAGS

02:03:52.825 --> 02:03:56.529 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS ACCORDING TO A STUDY

02:03:54.661 --> 02:03:58.064 region:rollup2
FROM UC SANTA BARBARA. BRAND

02:04:04.504 --> 02:04:07.740 region:rollup2
STANDARD WASHING MACHINES DO NOT

02:04:06.172 --> 02:04:09.842 region:rollup2
HAVE FILTERS TO CATCH THESE

02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:11.778 region:rollup2
FIBERS AND ONCE THEY ESCAPE FROM

02:04:09.842 --> 02:04:13.780 region:rollup2
OUR LAUNDRY THE TINY MOBILE

02:04:11.778 --> 02:04:15.982 region:rollup2
THREATS WORKED OUR WAY TO OUR

WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS.

02:04:15.982 --> 02:04:19.953 region:rollup2
THEIR FILTERS DON'T CATCH THE

02:04:17.617 --> 02:04:22.021 region:rollup2
FIBERS EITHER AND AS A RESULT IT

02:04:19.953 --> 02:04:23.890 region:rollup2
IS ESTIMATED THAT SYNTHETIC

02:04:22.021 --> 02:04:25.591 region:rollup2
FIBERS ARE BY COUNT. NOW THE

02:04:23.890 --> 02:04:27.827 region:rollup2
SINGLE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO

02:04:25.591 --> 02:04:30.129 region:rollup2
WATERSHED PLASTIC POLLUTION IN

DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND ACCOUNT

02:04:30.129 --> 02:04:32.332 region:rollup2
FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION.

02:04:31.798 --> 02:04:34.834 region:rollup2
PLASTIC WASTE ENTERING THE

02:04:32.332 --> 02:04:36.869 region:rollup2
OCEAN.

02:04:34.834 --> 02:04:38.271 region:rollup2
WE DON'T KNOW YET THE EXTENT TO

02:04:36.869 --> 02:04:39.706 region:rollup2
WHICH MICHAEL PLASTIC POLLUTION

02:04:38.271 --> 02:04:41.441 region:rollup2
MIGHT AFFECT HUMANS.

02:04:39.706 --> 02:04:43.209 region:rollup2
WE DO KNOW THAT MANY ANIMALS

02:04:41.441 --> 02:04:45.244 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE AQUATIC FOOD CHAIN

02:04:43.209 --> 02:04:46.446 region:rollup2
INGEST THESE PLASTICS.

02:04:45.244 --> 02:04:48.448 region:rollup2
THIS CAN TRANSFER TO THEIR

02:04:46.446 --> 02:04:49.549 region:rollup2
TISSUE AND BECAUSE GOD IMPACTION

02:04:48.448 --> 02:04:51.384 region:rollup2
HORMONE DISRUPTION AND LIVER

02:04:49.549 --> 02:04:53.653 region:rollup2

02:04:51.384 --> 02:04:57.090 region:rollup2
MEANING WE ARE ALSO INGESTING

02:04:53.653 --> 02:04:59.726 region:rollup2
PLASTIC MICROFIBER IS IF WE EAT.

02:04:57.090 --> 02:05:01.027 region:rollup2
THOSE OF FISH AS FOOD.

02:04:59.726 --> 02:05:02.795 region:rollup2
THIS RAISES AN IMPORTANT

02:05:01.027 --> 02:05:04.764 region:rollup2
QUESTION ABOUT THE HUMAN HEALTH

02:05:02.795 --> 02:05:05.698 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES OF UNINTENDED.

CONTINENTS.

02:05:29.889 --> 02:05:33.593 region:rollup2
AND MICHAEL PLASTIC FIBERS WERE

02:05:31.724 --> 02:05:35.528 region:rollup2
FOUND IN EVERY NEARLY EVERY

SITS.

02:05:42.268 --> 02:05:45.671 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS ARE FINDING THAT EVEN

02:05:43.903 --> 02:05:47.273 region:rollup2
BOTTLED WATER IS CONTAMINATED

02:05:45.671 --> 02:05:49.208 region:rollup2
WITH MICHAEL FIBERS.

02:05:47.273 --> 02:05:51.310 region:rollup2
NOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT BOTTLED

02:05:49.208 --> 02:05:52.945 region:rollup2
WATER THIS IS WATER THAT GOES

02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:54.947 region:rollup2
THROUGH A VERY EXTENSIVE

02:05:52.945 --> 02:05:56.649 region:rollup2
FILTRATION PROCESS.

02:05:54.947 --> 02:05:58.084 region:rollup2
RESEARCHERS RECENTLY EXAMINED

INDICATE THAT THE GARMENT SHEDS

02:06:25.578 --> 02:06:28.414 region:rollup2
PLASTIC MICROFIBER IS WHEN

02:06:26.946 --> 02:06:29.982 region:rollup2
WASHED.

02:06:28.414 --> 02:06:31.851 region:rollup2
AND THAT THAT CONTRIBUTES TO

02:06:29.982 --> 02:06:34.320 region:rollup2
MARINE PLASTIC POLLUTION AND

02:06:31.851 --> 02:06:36.122 region:rollup2
THAT LANGUAGE WHILE NOT EXACT

02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:38.391 region:rollup2
THAT IS PART OF THE MOST RECENT

02:06:36.122 --> 02:06:40.426 region:rollup2

IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT WE DON'T

02:12:58.137 --> 02:13:00.840 region:rollup2
THINK MANDATORY LABELING AT

02:12:59.338 --> 02:13:01.807 region:rollup2

MICROFIBER. FIBER POLLUTION ARE.

02:13:23.729 --> 02:13:28.000 region:rollup2
DO WE THINK THIS BILL AS A

02:13:25.931 --> 02:13:30.135 region:rollup2
MANDATORY LABELING CREATES

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:31.637 region:rollup2

02:13:30.135 --> 02:13:33.639 region:rollup2

RETAILERS REQUIRES NOT ONE BUT

02:13:33.639 --> 02:13:35.975 region:rollup2
TO.

02:13:34.540 --> 02:13:37.376 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT LABELS THAT WE DON'T

02:13:35.975 --> 02:13:40.279 region:rollup2
THINK WE'LL HAVE AN IMPACT ON

02:13:37.376 --> 02:13:40.713 region:rollup2
THE CONSUMERS EITHER PURCHASING

02:13:40.279 --> 02:13:42.481 region:rollup2
OR WASHING HABITS.

02:13:40.713 --> 02:13:43.849 region:rollup2
.

02:13:42.481 --> 02:13:45.317 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT

02:13:43.849 --> 02:13:47.253 region:rollup2
CONSUMER LIKE THIS CONSUMERS

02:13:45.317 --> 02:13:48.888 region:rollup2
LIKE THESE MATERIALS AND AND

02:13:47.253 --> 02:13:50.356 region:rollup2
CLOTHING MADE OUT OF THEM

02:13:48.888 --> 02:13:53.425 region:rollup2
THEY'RE OFTEN VERY DURABLE AND

02:13:50.356 --> 02:13:56.061 region:rollup2
LESS EXPENSIVE. THAN A CLOTHING

02:13:53.425 --> 02:13:57.997 region:rollup2
MADE OUT OF WOOL COTTON OR.

02:13:56.061 --> 02:14:00.299 region:rollup2
LINEN OR OTHER NATURAL MATERIALS

02:13:57.997 --> 02:14:02.001 region:rollup2
IN FACT THOSE MATERIALS MAY HAVE

02:14:00.299 --> 02:14:05.137 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

02:14:02.001 --> 02:14:05.337 region:rollup2
SUCH AS MORE WATER YEARS.

02:14:05.137 --> 02:14:06.639 region:rollup2
AND.

02:14:05.337 --> 02:14:08.541 region:rollup2
.

02:14:06.639 --> 02:14:10.109 region:rollup2
AND PRODUCING THEM DOESN'T

02:14:08.541 --> 02:14:11.343 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY THAT CREATES OTHER

02:14:10.109 --> 02:14:12.678 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS

02:14:11.343 --> 02:14:13.712 region:rollup2
BEEN WELL AWARE OF.

02:14:12.678 --> 02:14:16.148 region:rollup2
FINALLY I WOULD ARGUE THAT

02:14:13.712 --> 02:14:17.516 region:rollup2
ANOTHER LABEL ON CLOTHING ADS

02:14:16.148 --> 02:14:18.784 region:rollup2
HAVE KIT WHICH CONSUMERS WILL

02:14:17.516 --> 02:14:20.019 region:rollup2
THROW WEIGHT DOES ADD TO THE

02:14:18.784 --> 02:14:21.086 region:rollup2
WASTE STREAM WHICH IS SOMETHING

02:14:20.019 --> 02:14:22.454 region:rollup2
I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU TO

02:16:40.059 --> 02:16:43.328 region:rollup2
DEBATE? ON THIS BILL AND SINCE

02:16:42.127 --> 02:16:45.898 region:rollup2

WHICH WHICH IS IT'S GOOD AND BAD

02:16:52.905 --> 02:16:57.609 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK ORIGINALLY THEY

02:16:55.340 --> 02:17:00.379 region:rollup2
HAD TO PUT ON THERE THAT THEY

02:16:57.609 --> 02:17:01.747 region:rollup2
WOULD RELEASE MICRO FIBERS AND

02:17:00.379 --> 02:17:02.247 region:rollup2
THAT IT SHOULD BE HAND WASHED.

02:17:01.747 --> 02:17:03.582 region:rollup2

MATERIAL MAY RELEASE MICRO

02:17:15.461 --> 02:17:18.730 region:rollup2
FIBERS BUT YOU DON'T

02:17:17.096 --> 02:17:20.632 region:rollup2
TELL THE CONSUMER WHAT THEY

02:17:18.730 --> 02:17:22.167 region:rollup2
SHOULD DO ABOUT THAT THEN I AM

02:17:20.632 --> 02:17:23.335 region:rollup2
KINDA LEFT TO WONDER WALL WILL

02:17:22.167 --> 02:17:24.636 region:rollup2
THAT CHANGE ANYTHING WILL THEY

02:17:23.335 --> 02:17:26.238 region:rollup2
EVEN READ IT.

02:17:24.636 --> 02:17:27.673 region:rollup2
SOME WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE A

02:17:26.238 --> 02:17:29.641 region:rollup2
LITTLE MORE IN TUNE WITH.

02:17:27.673 --> 02:17:30.976 region:rollup2
THIS TYPE OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE

02:17:29.641 --> 02:17:32.745 region:rollup2
BUT MANY OTHERS WILL NOT.

02:17:30.976 --> 02:17:35.013 region:rollup2
.

02:17:32.745 --> 02:17:37.349 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF.

02:17:35.013 --> 02:17:38.684 region:rollup2
THE MANUFACTURING WORLD WOULD

02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:40.719 region:rollup2
COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT

02:17:38.684 --> 02:17:42.855 region:rollup2
PERHAPS COULD BE MADE PART OF

02:17:40.719 --> 02:17:44.123 region:rollup2
OUR WASHING MACHINES THAT COULD

02:17:42.855 --> 02:17:45.090 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW CATCH THE SORT OF

02:17:44.123 --> 02:17:47.392 region:rollup2
PARTICLES.

02:17:45.090 --> 02:17:48.560 region:rollup2
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET I'M A

02:17:47.392 --> 02:17:49.795 region:rollup2
LITTLE SURPRISED I HAVEN'T SEEN

02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:52.064 region:rollup2
SOMEONE ON SHARK TANK WITH SOME

02:17:49.795 --> 02:17:53.198 region:rollup2
GREAT IDEA OF YOU KNOW HOW TO DO

02:17:52.064 --> 02:17:55.267 region:rollup2
THIS TO MAKE A ZILLION DOLLARS.

02:17:53.198 --> 02:17:58.270 region:rollup2
.

02:17:55.267 --> 02:18:00.038 region:rollup2
BUT THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET SO.

02:17:58.270 --> 02:18:01.773 region:rollup2
I SHARE YOUR CONCERN.

02:18:00.038 --> 02:18:03.142 region:rollup2
ABOUT

02:18:01.773 --> 02:18:04.510 region:rollup2
THESE PARTICLES GOING INTO OUR

02:18:03.142 --> 02:18:05.377 region:rollup2
WATERWAYS IN THE ENVIRONMENT I

02:18:04.510 --> 02:18:07.212 region:rollup2
REALLY DO.

02:18:05.377 --> 02:18:09.715 region:rollup2
WOULD BE GREAT IF EVERYBODY

02:18:07.212 --> 02:18:12.918 region:rollup2
WERE NATURAL A ARE YOU KNOW

02:18:09.715 --> 02:18:15.454 region:rollup2
GARMENTS BUT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN

02:18:12.918 --> 02:18:17.422 region:rollup2
AND I'M JUST NOT CONVINCED THAT.

02:18:15.454 --> 02:18:18.857 region:rollup2
LABEL IT LABELING IT BY SAYING

02:18:17.422 --> 02:18:20.159 region:rollup2
THAT IT RELEASES THESE MICRO

02:18:18.857 --> 02:18:22.060 region:rollup2
FIBERS WILL NECESSARILY GET

02:18:20.159 --> 02:18:22.361 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO ACT.

02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:24.096 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY.

02:18:22.361 --> 02:18:25.998 region:rollup2
.

02:18:24.096 --> 02:18:27.566 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THIS BILL IS

02:18:25.998 --> 02:18:29.201 region:rollup2
GONNA CHANGE AT ALL ONCE IT

02:18:27.566 --> 02:18:31.737 region:rollup2
MOVES FROM HERE BUT I JUST WANT

02:18:29.201 --> 02:18:33.972 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT I DO SUPPORT. ON

02:18:31.737 --> 02:18:35.274 region:rollup2
YOUR EFFORTS I'D.

02:18:33.972 --> 02:18:36.742 region:rollup2
I JUST DON'T SUPPORT THIS

02:18:35.274 --> 02:18:37.910 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR BILL BECAUSE I'M NOT

02:18:36.742 --> 02:18:39.545 region:rollup2
CONVINCED IT WILL ACTUALLY

02:18:37.910 --> 02:18:41.079 region:rollup2
CHANGE CONSUMER. BEHAVIOR BUT I

02:18:39.545 --> 02:18:42.214 region:rollup2
HOPE.

02:18:41.079 --> 02:18:43.682 region:rollup2
I HOPE THAT CHANGES IN THE

02:18:42.214 --> 02:18:44.950 region:rollup2
FUTURE WHERE YOU AND I CAN CAN

02:18:43.682 --> 02:18:47.553 region:rollup2
PARTNER IN ONE OF THESE THEM

02:18:44.950 --> 02:18:48.954 region:rollup2
BELL SO. WITH THAT BEING SAID

02:18:47.553 --> 02:18:50.389 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AND THEN

02:18:48.954 --> 02:18:52.191 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THE CHAIRMAN AND WILL

02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:52.491 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME COMMENTS.

02:18:52.191 --> 02:18:54.660 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:18:52.491 --> 02:18:56.195 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THE A LABELING

02:18:54.660 --> 02:18:57.429 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE COULD TELL YOU SOME

02:18:56.195 --> 02:18:59.331 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS I THINK WE'RE IN

02:18:57.429 --> 02:18:59.665 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT DARREN WILL CONTINUE

02:18:59.331 --> 02:19:01.900 region:rollup2
TO WORK ON.

02:18:59.665 --> 02:19:03.335 region:rollup2
OF THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE OF THE

02:19:01.900 --> 02:19:04.503 region:rollup2
BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD TO TO

02:19:03.335 --> 02:19:06.038 region:rollup2
PASS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY

02:19:04.503 --> 02:19:07.573 region:rollup2
BUT TARA I THINK MADAM VICE

02:19:06.038 --> 02:19:10.375 region:rollup2
CHAIR YOU JUST KIND OF PUT YOUR

02:19:07.573 --> 02:19:12.144 region:rollup2
FINGER ON. ON WHAT TO ADD THE

02:19:10.375 --> 02:19:13.545 region:rollup2
FIRST STEP NEEDS TO BE HERE ON

02:19:12.144 --> 02:19:15.747 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE LIKE THIS AND THAT'S

02:19:13.545 --> 02:19:17.583 region:rollup2
RAISING AWARENESS THAT'S EXACTLY

02:19:15.747 --> 02:19:18.283 region:rollup2
WHAT THESE LABELS ARE INTENDED

02:19:17.583 --> 02:19:20.586 region:rollup2
TO DO.

02:19:18.283 --> 02:19:22.654 region:rollup2
OF YOUR CORRECT WE DON'T KNOW

02:19:20.586 --> 02:19:24.356 region:rollup2
ENOUGH.

02:19:22.654 --> 02:19:26.491 region:rollup2
BUT WE KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT

02:19:24.356 --> 02:19:30.262 region:rollup2
THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM.

02:19:26.491 --> 02:19:31.063 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT TO SOME LAUNDERING

02:19:30.262 --> 02:19:32.731 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES ARE BETTER THAN

02:19:31.063 --> 02:19:35.801 region:rollup2
OTHERS.

02:19:32.731 --> 02:19:38.737 region:rollup2
BUT THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT

02:19:35.801 --> 02:19:39.972 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC NEEDS IS AWARENESS ON

02:19:38.737 --> 02:19:42.274 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE WITH SO THAT WE CAN

02:19:39.972 --> 02:19:43.809 region:rollup2
BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT IT. AND

02:19:42.274 --> 02:19:45.711 region:rollup2
THAT WILL LEAD TO PEOPLE HAVE

02:19:43.809 --> 02:19:47.012 region:rollup2
NOW TO SHARK TANK IN THE.

02:19:45.711 --> 02:19:48.647 region:rollup2
PRODUCING GOT EVEN BETTER

02:19:47.012 --> 02:19:50.782 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS FORCE BUT AWARENESS IS

02:19:48.647 --> 02:19:55.587 region:rollup2
KEY. AND THAT WITHOUT I

02:19:50.782 --> 02:19:56.855 region:rollup2
RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

02:19:55.587 --> 02:19:57.823 region:rollup2
CHAU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

02:19:56.855 --> 02:19:59.524 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH US.

02:19:57.823 --> 02:20:01.727 region:rollup2
ARM

02:19:59.524 --> 02:20:02.261 region:rollup2
I DO THINK THAT WHAT WE'VE DONE

02:20:01.727 --> 02:20:05.063 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF LIABILITY DOES

02:20:02.261 --> 02:20:06.331 region:rollup2
LIMIT.

02:20:05.063 --> 02:20:08.333 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUSLY THE AMOUNT OF

02:20:06.331 --> 02:20:10.969 region:rollup2
LIABILITY WHAT WHAT DO THERE I

02:20:08.333 --> 02:20:13.505 region:rollup2
NOR THE AUTHOR WANTED.

02:20:10.969 --> 02:20:15.407 region:rollup2
WAS FOR SOMEBODY TO HAVE BE FINE

02:20:13.505 --> 02:20:17.943 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE TAG FELL OFF.

02:20:15.407 --> 02:20:19.611 region:rollup2
WITH ONLY ALLOWING DEA'S AG'S.

02:20:17.943 --> 02:20:21.713 region:rollup2
.

02:20:19.611 --> 02:20:22.314 region:rollup2
TO PURSUE THIS AND SINCE THEY

02:20:21.713 --> 02:20:23.982 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS TO

02:20:22.314 --> 02:20:26.118 region:rollup2
DO.

02:20:23.982 --> 02:20:27.886 region:rollup2
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD

02:20:26.118 --> 02:20:31.256 region:rollup2
DO SOMETHING UNLESS

02:20:27.886 --> 02:20:34.092 region:rollup2
ARE. THE RETAILER WERE NOT.

02:20:31.256 --> 02:20:36.395 region:rollup2
TO. NOT PUT LABELS ON AT ALL OR

02:20:34.092 --> 02:20:37.996 region:rollup2
THAT MANUFACTURER WE'RE NOT TO

02:20:36.395 --> 02:20:39.164 region:rollup2
PUT LABELS ON AT ALL. AND THAT

02:20:37.996 --> 02:20:40.565 region:rollup2
WAS THE INTENTION OF THAT

02:20:39.164 --> 02:20:42.167 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT AND I THINK THAT DOES

02:20:40.565 --> 02:20:44.603 region:rollup2
LIMIT THE LIABILITY.

02:20:42.167 --> 02:20:46.805 region:rollup2
AS S. B. AUTHOR SAID WE DON'T

02:20:44.603 --> 02:20:48.240 region:rollup2
HAVE A SOLUTION. THIS IS A WAY

02:20:46.805 --> 02:20:49.741 region:rollup2
TO GET PEOPLE TO REALIZE

02:20:48.240 --> 02:20:51.743 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE

02:20:49.741 --> 02:20:54.146 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN GET SOMEONE SHARK TANK

02:20:51.743 --> 02:20:56.081 region:rollup2
TARA COME UP WITH A SOLUTION.

02:20:54.146 --> 02:20:57.416 region:rollup2
ARM SO.

02:20:56.081 --> 02:20:59.418 region:rollup2

WHICH IS NOT SURE HOW MUCH THAT

02:21:02.754 --> 02:21:06.692 region:rollup2
WOULD HELP EITHER SO. THERE'S A

02:21:04.423 --> 02:21:08.193 region:rollup2
LOT TO BE LEARNED AND I THINK

02:21:06.692 --> 02:21:09.961 region:rollup2
THE FIRST STEP IS EDUCATION.

02:21:08.193 --> 02:21:11.830 region:rollup2
I'M A SCIENTIST

02:21:09.961 --> 02:21:13.966 region:rollup2
