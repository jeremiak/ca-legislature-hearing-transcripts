DOUBLING OR TRIPLING OVERNIGHT.

00:38:25.269 --> 00:38:26.070
IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT

00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:27.038

BE CLEAR. THOSE AFFORDABLE

00:40:01.232 --> 00:40:02.566
UNITS ARE NOT UNDER THE STATE'S

PEOPLE WHO REALLY CONSULTING

THE CRACKS AND WHO ARE A

00:40:09.473 --> 00:40:11.275
SERIOUS RISK OF BECOMING

HOMELESS. THERE ARE TENS OF

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.811
THOUSANDS OF SUCH UNITS THAT

00:40:13.878 --> 00:40:15.079
ARE GOING TO BE LEAVING THEIR

00:40:15.146 --> 00:40:16.313
CONFIDENCE AND CONVERTED TO

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.148
MARKET RATE WITHIN THE NEXT FEW

00:40:17.214 --> 00:40:18.682
YEARS ACCORDING TO THE

00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:20.484
CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP

00:40:20.551 --> 00:40:22.353

THE LARGEST NUMBER OF HOMES

00:40:28.759 --> 00:40:30.661
CONVERTED TO MARKET RATE SINCE

00:40:30.728 --> 00:40:32.163

LOS HOUSING UNIT REPRESENTS

00:40:33.497 --> 00:40:34.698
ANOTHER LOW INCOME FAMILY

00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:36.433
WITHOUT AN AFFORDABLE HOME IN A

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.602
TIME OF INCREASINGLY HIGH RENTS

00:40:38.669 --> 00:40:40.371
AND HOMELESSNESS WE JUST CANNOT

00:40:40.437 --> 00:40:43.674
ALLOW THIS TREND TO CONTINUE-

00:40:43.741 --> 00:40:45.109
OVER THE YEARS WE'VE PASSED A

00:40:45.176 --> 00:40:46.544
STORAGE PROTECTION AND- AND-

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:48.245
PRODUCTION BILLS. BUT WHAT'S

00:40:48.312 --> 00:40:49.613
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.915
SKIP OVER THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:52.850
PRESERVING. THE AFFORDABLE

00:40:52.917 --> 00:40:54.852
UNITS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. A

00:40:54.919 --> 00:40:56.821
LOT OF MONEY AND TIME WHEN INTO

00:40:56.887 --> 00:40:57.788
CREATING THOSE AND THIS IS A

00:40:57.855 --> 00:40:59.590
WAY TO ALLOW THE MARKET. THAT

00:40:59.657 --> 00:41:01.392
IF THE OWNER SO CHOOSE TO GIVE

00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:03.093
THEM AN INCENTIVE FOR SELLING

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.662
THEIR UNITS A WHAT WOULD

00:41:04.728 --> 00:41:06.096
OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE TO THEM

00:41:06.163 --> 00:41:07.398
A LOT OF THESE OWNERS WANT TO

00:41:07.464 --> 00:41:08.699
DO THE RIGHT THING. BUT WE JUST

00:41:08.766 --> 00:41:10.100
HAVEN'T PUT THEM IN A FINANCIAL

00:41:10.167 --> 00:41:11.635
POSITION WERE DOING SO IT'S

00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:14.572
POSSIBLE THIS OPENS UP THAT

00:41:14.638 --> 00:41:15.739
DOOR. TO HUMANE OWNERS TO

00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:16.874
HAVING SOME CHANCE OF BEING

00:41:16.941 --> 00:41:19.844
ABLE TO- DO DEAL WITH THE ASSET

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:21.078
THAT WOULD THEY'VE EXPECTED TO

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:22.813
CONVERT TO MARKET RATE. GIVEN

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:23.914
THE CHANCE OF PRESERVING THOSE

00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:25.850
TENANTS IN PLACE. WITHOUT I

00:41:25.916 --> 00:41:26.917
RESPECTFULLY WOULD REQUEST YOUR

00:41:26.984 --> 00:41:29.887
SUPPORT ON AB TWENTY FIFTY

00:41:29.954 --> 00:41:31.956
EIGHT THANK YOU. THINK YOU'RE

00:41:32.022 --> 00:41:32.857
ADDITIONAL IN AS A SUPPORT.

00:41:32.923 --> 00:41:39.697
GOOD ACTORS. I KNOW OUR BEHALF

00:41:39.763 --> 00:41:42.733
OF WESTERN CINEMA POVERTY- AS

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.735
BOTH AUTHORS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED

00:41:44.802 --> 00:41:46.904
WE HAVE A LOOMING CRISIS OF

00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:48.706
EXPIRING DEED RESTRICTIONS BUT

00:41:48.772 --> 00:41:49.473
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.809
SECONDARY CRISIS THAT THIS BILL

00:41:51.876 --> 00:41:52.409
WOULD ALSO HELP ADDRESS WHICH

00:41:52.476 --> 00:41:54.645
IS THAT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF

00:41:54.712 --> 00:41:56.981
LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS DON'T

00:41:57.047 --> 00:41:58.849
LIVE IN A DEED RESTRICTED UNIT

00:41:58.916 --> 00:42:00.284
AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT

00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:01.619
OF A HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER

00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:02.519
BECAUSE THEY ARE IN WILLFUL

00:42:02.586 --> 00:42:04.555
UNDERSUPPLY MOST LOW INCOME

00:42:04.622 --> 00:42:05.422
PEOPLE LIVE IN MARKET RATE

00:42:05.489 --> 00:42:07.291
HOUSING. THEY SIMPLY LIVE IN

00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:08.692
THE MOST AFFORDABLE MARKET RATE

00:42:08.759 --> 00:42:11.028
HOUSING THAT THEY CAN FIND- AND

00:42:11.095 --> 00:42:12.796
AS WE KNOW WE HAVE RAPIDLY

00:42:12.863 --> 00:42:14.965
ESCALATING RENTS IN THE STATE-

00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:16.467
AND AS THOSE AROUND CONTINUE GO

00:42:16.533 --> 00:42:17.468
OUT MORE AND MORE LOW INCOME

00:42:17.534 --> 00:42:18.769
FAMILIES ARE GETTING PRICED OUT

00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:19.703
OF EVEN THEIR MARKET RATE

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:21.405
UNITS. THIS BILL WILL ENABLE A

00:42:21.472 --> 00:42:22.907
MISSION DRIVEN NONPROFIT TO GO

00:42:22.973 --> 00:42:24.875
AND- IF THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY

00:42:24.942 --> 00:42:26.477
AND PURCHASE A MARKET RATE

00:42:26.543 --> 00:42:27.645
BUILDING THAT IS OCCUPIED

00:42:27.711 --> 00:42:29.013
PREDOMINATELY BY LOW INCOME

00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:30.314
PEOPLE AND ACTUALLY TURN IT

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:32.082
INTO THE RESTRICTED HOUSING FOR

00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:33.150
FIFTY FIVE YEARS. WHICH IS A

00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:35.719
HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND OUR

00:42:35.786 --> 00:42:37.755
SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING-

00:42:37.821 --> 00:42:39.356
IN A MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE

00:42:39.423 --> 00:42:40.624
WAY THAN THE NEW CONSTRUCTION

00:42:40.691 --> 00:42:42.359
SO WE'RE CURRENTLY SHORT ABOUT

00:42:42.426 --> 00:42:43.427
ONE POINT FIVE MILLION UNITS

00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:44.895
STATEWIDE AFFORDABLE TO LOWER

00:42:44.962 --> 00:42:45.930
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS SO IN

00:42:45.996 --> 00:42:47.131
ADDITION TO PRESERVING THE FACT

00:42:47.197 --> 00:42:48.232
THAT WE ALREADY HAVE WE REALLY

00:42:48.299 --> 00:42:49.433
NEED TO INCREASE THAT SUPPLY

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:53.337
THIS IS A CREATIVE WAY TO GET

00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:54.038
OUT THAT AND- HOPEFULLY. A THE

00:42:54.104 --> 00:42:55.539
BILLS ON WE CAN OUT THE REAL TO

00:42:55.606 --> 00:42:57.608

PARTNERSHIP IN TODAY ALSO ON

00:43:05.816 --> 00:43:07.084

CUT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE TO

00:43:13.657 --> 00:43:14.091
WHICH THIS BILL WILL BE

00:43:14.158 --> 00:43:15.859
ASSIGNED- THE CALIFORNIA

00:43:15.926 --> 00:43:17.861
HOUSING PARTNERSHIP WAS CREATED

00:43:17.928 --> 00:43:18.562
ACTUALLY BY THE LEGISLATURE

00:43:18.629 --> 00:43:19.863

THESE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:23.500
THAT ARE UNDER A DEED

00:43:23.567 --> 00:43:25.035
RESTRICTION BUT THAT- EIGHT

COMING NEAR TO THE TIME WHEN

00:43:26.303 --> 00:43:27.972
THOSE CONTRACTS EXPIRE. AND

00:43:28.038 --> 00:43:29.006
THIS IS A BILL THAT WE FEEL IS

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:30.941
CRITICAL TO THAT EFFORT. LIKE

EXISTING MARKET RATE- UNITS AND

00:43:38.582 --> 00:43:40.017
KEEP THEM AFFORDABLE OVER TIME.

00:43:40.084 --> 00:43:41.251
BRING US ACTUALLY BRING THEM

OPPORTUNITIES IN THAT. IN THAT

00:43:46.657 --> 00:43:47.891
IN THAT SPHERE AND WE THINK

00:43:47.958 --> 00:43:49.360
THAT THAT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT

00:43:49.426 --> 00:43:51.628
ASPECT TO MAINTAIN IN THE BILL.

00:43:51.695 --> 00:43:52.830
AND THEN JUST TO KIND OF GET TO

00:43:52.896 --> 00:43:53.897

BUT RIGHT NOW. THE MARKET THE

01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:48.117
CAMPUS MARKET PLACE IN

01:04:48.184 --> 01:04:50.186
CALIFORNIA IS FAILING. WHAT DO

01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:52.288
I MEAN BY THAT- THE LESSER

01:04:52.355 --> 01:04:53.990
MARKET PLACES DOMINATING NOT

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:55.258
THE REGULATED MARKETPLACE WHICH

ILLICIT MARKET PLACE. AND SO IT

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.370
IN RESPONSE TO THE VERY LARGE

01:05:07.436 --> 01:05:08.971
ILLICIT MARKET PLACE THAT WE

01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:10.039
NEED TO PASS A BE NINETEEN

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:12.308
FORTY EIGHT. EN MY VIEW WHICH

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:14.176
WILL CREATE A THREE YEAR WINDOW

01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:15.244
TO ACCELERATE ENCOURAGE

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:16.646
CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES TO

01:05:16.712 --> 01:05:17.913
TRANSITION AWAY FROM THE LIST

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.182
OF MARKET PLACE AND TO. THE

01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:22.084
REGULATED MARKET PLACE. IT HAS

01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:24.754
A EXCISE TAX DECREASE OF 4% FOR

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:25.855
THREE YEARS AND A ELIMINATION

01:05:25.921 --> 01:05:27.456
OF THE CULTIVATION TAX FOR

01:05:27.523 --> 01:05:28.958
THOSE THREE YEARS AND THEN- THE

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:31.327
TAXES WILL RETURN TO WHAT THEY

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:31.894
WERE AFTER THOSE THREE YEARS

01:05:31.961 --> 01:05:32.862
WIDE. ARE THOSE THREE YEARS

01:05:32.928 --> 01:05:34.030
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THOSE. ARE

01:05:34.096 --> 01:05:35.865
THE EARLY YEARS WHERE AS THE

01:05:35.931 --> 01:05:38.200
CANNABIS MARKETPLACE MATURES IN

01:05:38.267 --> 01:05:39.735
THE REGULAR MARKET PLACE-

01:05:39.802 --> 01:05:42.505
GROWS- BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS

01:05:42.571 --> 01:05:43.272
CAN MAKE THE DECISION TO

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:44.907
ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE IN THE

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:46.942
REGULATED MARKET PLACE INSTEAD

01:05:47.009 --> 01:05:47.510
OF THE ILLICIT MARKET PLACE

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:48.744
WHERE THEY'VE BEEN. FOR MANY

01:05:48.811 --> 01:05:51.580
YEARS SO THIS IS A STRATEGY

01:05:51.647 --> 01:05:53.449
THAT IS NOT UNPRECEDENTED IT'S

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:54.550
WORKED IN OTHER STATES SUCH AS

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:58.120
OR AN AND IN WASHINGTON. AND

01:05:58.187 --> 01:05:58.621
WE'VE SEEN THAT IN THOSE

01:05:58.688 --> 01:05:59.955
CIRCUMSTANCES A SIMPLIFICATION

01:06:00.022 --> 01:06:01.023
OF THE TAXES AND LOWERING OF

THEM. BE REVENUE ACTUALLY GROW

01:06:03.959 --> 01:06:05.594

01:06:13.669 --> 01:06:15.204
HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW THE

REGULATED MARKETPLACE WHICH IS

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:20.343
ONLY 25% OF COURSE AS- PART- IS

01:06:20.409 --> 01:06:23.579
OBSERVE LOWERING BARRIERS MOVE

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:26.349
OVER TO THE REGULAR MARKET

01:06:26.415 --> 01:06:26.816

01:15:37.766 --> 01:15:38.333
AROUND THE BEST APPROACH GOING

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.835
FORWARD AND APPRECIATE THE

01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:42.037
DIALOGUE DISCUSSION ON THAT. AM

01:15:42.104 --> 01:15:43.839
I DO THINK THERE SHOULD BE NO

01:15:43.906 --> 01:15:46.141
DISPUTE ABOUT THE- THE THREAT

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:46.975
TO THE CAR REGULATED MARKET

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:48.644
PLACE IN THE FACT THAT SEVENTY

01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:49.611
FIVE PERCENT. OF THE SALES ARE

01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:50.746
IN THE LIST OF MARKET PLACE AND

01:15:50.812 --> 01:15:52.214
THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:53.348
VOTERS VOTED FOR PROP SIXTY

01:15:53.415 --> 01:15:55.584
FOUR. IF WE'RE GONNA. MEET THE

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:56.518
VOTERS WELL WE NEED TO CREATE A

01:15:56.585 --> 01:15:58.086
ROBUST SUCCESSFUL WORKING

01:15:58.153 --> 01:15:59.187
REGULATED MARKET PLACE AND WE

01:15:59.254 --> 01:16:00.422
DON'T HAVE THAT WE ONLY HAVE A

01:16:00.489 --> 01:16:02.491
FEW LEVERS AT OUR DISPOSAL. ONE

01:16:02.557 --> 01:16:05.093
IS LOWERING TAXES AND OTHER IS.

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:08.330
A SIMPLE FIND. REGULATIONS WE

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:09.765
CAN ALSO CRACKED DOWN ON THE

01:16:09.831 --> 01:16:10.799
ILLICIT MARKET PLACE WITH

01:16:10.866 --> 01:16:11.800
ENFORCEMENT I THINK WE SHOULD

01:16:11.867 --> 01:16:13.835
DO ALL THREE- BUT THIS IS ONE

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:15.737
VERY IMPORTANT. PART OF THAT

01:16:15.804 --> 01:16:16.605
THREE LEGGED STOOL LOWERING

01:16:16.672 --> 01:16:18.774
LOWERING THE TAXES SO- I KNOW

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:19.708
THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS ALSO

01:16:19.775 --> 01:16:22.311
ABOUT. MAKING SURE WE HIT THE-

01:16:22.377 --> 01:16:24.646
THRESHOLDS ASSESS SET FORTH BY

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:26.148
THE LA I THINK THEY- THEY- PICK

01:16:26.214 --> 01:16:27.616
THAT AT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:28.250
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:31.053
REVENUE. GENERATION THE LAST

01:16:31.119 --> 01:16:34.389
TWO QUARTERS ARE WE JUST OF- AB

01:16:34.456 --> 01:16:34.990
MARCH SIXTH TWENTY TWENTY AT

01:16:35.057 --> 01:16:36.191
LEAST. US THAT. THE LAST TWO

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:37.225
QUARTERS JUST FOR THE EXCISE

01:16:37.292 --> 01:16:38.694
TAX ALONE NOT THE CULTIVATION

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.529
TAX. GENERATED EIGHTY FOUR

01:16:40.595 --> 01:16:41.897
POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS EACH

01:16:41.964 --> 01:16:44.967
OF THOSE QUARTERS IF YOU. I AM.

01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:46.001
REJECT IT OUT FOR A FULL YEAR

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:47.970
THAT'S JUST ABOUT JUST UNDER

01:16:48.036 --> 01:16:49.571
THREE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION. ON

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:54.076
THE EXCISE TAX ALONE- SO. YOU

01:16:54.142 --> 01:16:55.711

01:16:55.777 --> 01:16:58.313
WERE IN THAT RANGE- TO HIT

01:16:58.380 --> 01:16:59.081
