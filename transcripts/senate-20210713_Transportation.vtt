00:13:23.903 --> 00:13:25.037
THING IS REALLY FRUSTRATED OR

00:13:25.104 --> 00:13:27.072
CITY WHICH IS BEING CONSTANTLY

00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:28.674

PRIORITIZE ROAD SAFETY. AND

00:13:33.245 --> 00:13:34.613
THIS IS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.683
USES- A SYSTEM CALLED THE

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.751
EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE THAT

00:13:38.817 --> 00:13:40.886
FORCES CITIES TO THAT IN ORDER

00:13:40.953 --> 00:13:42.855
TO ENFORCE SPEED LIMITS THEY

TO GET TO AND WORK OFTEN SEE.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.341
THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WE

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:03.943

ROAD NOISE NO SENSE OF MOTION

00:14:17.256 --> 00:14:19.058
AND THIS ALSO ENCOURAGES PEOPLE

00:14:19.124 --> 00:14:21.193
FRANKLY TO SPEED. SO THE EIGHTY

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:21.894
FIFTH PERCENTILE IT'S BEEN

00:14:21.961 --> 00:14:22.828
SOMETHING THAT'S VERY

00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:24.830
FRUSTRATING FOR ALL OF OUR

THAN A CAR GOES ALMOST

00:14:36.141 --> 00:14:37.343
EXPONENTIALLY INCREASES THE

APPROACH TO KEEPING OUR STREETS

00:17:31.483 --> 00:17:33.318
SAFE. THAT TAKES TIME AND MONEY

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:34.753
CURRENT LAW COURSES THAT YOU

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.555

YOU FAST AND A STREET THAT IS

00:17:39.858 --> 00:17:40.759
UNENFORCEABLE. THIS IS WHY WE

00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:44.897
MEASURE OF COURAGE AND FAITH.

SEVERITY OF THE CRASH TO FIVE

00:19:45.651 --> 00:19:46.785

00:28:33.445 --> 00:28:34.245
REPORT BY THE EUROPEAN

00:28:34.312 --> 00:28:35.880
TALLAHASSEE FORCE CONCEDES THAT

00:28:35.947 --> 00:28:37.715
THE MOTION EXPECTED ABOUT A ONE

00:28:37.782 --> 00:28:38.683
TO TWO MILE PER HOUR CHANGING

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.151
SPEEDS. AND EVEN THAT

00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:41.653
OVERSTATES THE EFFECT DARBUS

00:28:41.719 --> 00:28:42.654
BEACH MATCH THE WAY THE

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.988
GOVERNMENT BUILT THE ROADWAY

00:28:44.055 --> 00:28:45.590
NOT THE NUMBER ON THE SIGN.

00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:47.092
SPEED LIMIT SET MORE THAN FIVE

00:28:47.158 --> 00:28:48.593
MILES AN HOUR DIFFERENCE FROM

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:49.861
THIS DESIGN SPEED AS MEASURED

00:28:49.928 --> 00:28:50.995
BY SPEED SURVEY CAN BE

00:28:51.062 --> 00:28:52.197
DANGEROUS CAUSING INCREASE

00:28:52.263 --> 00:28:53.598
SPEED VARIATION WHICH LEADS TO

00:28:53.665 --> 00:28:54.999
INCREASED COLLISIONS. FURTHER

00:28:55.066 --> 00:28:56.868
FORCING DRIVERS TO HYPER FOCUS

00:28:56.935 --> 00:28:57.902
ON MAINTAINING AN UNCOMFORTABLE

00:28:57.969 --> 00:28:59.070
SPEED NOT ALIGNED WITH THE

00:28:59.137 --> 00:29:00.672
ROADWAY GEOMETRY BECAUSE

00:29:00.738 --> 00:29:01.940
INCREASED DRIVER'S DISTRACTION

00:29:02.006 --> 00:29:03.508
AND MORE DANGER FOR PEDESTRIANS

00:29:03.575 --> 00:29:05.009
AND BICYCLISTS. BLOWING AS

00:29:05.076 --> 00:29:06.511
BEING WITH IS NOT LOWER SPEED

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:07.512
SIMPLY LOWERED THE BAR TO

00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:09.547
ENFORCEMENT MAKING VIOLATORS

00:29:09.614 --> 00:29:10.148
OUT OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF

DRIVERS. SPEED LIMITS ARE

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:12.817
SUPPOSED TO INDICATE WHO THE

00:29:12.884 --> 00:29:14.052
OUT LIARS ARE BUT WHEN THE

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:16.287
SPEED LIMIT BY DEFINITION MAKES

00:29:16.354 --> 00:29:16.855
FIFTY SIXTY OR EVEN 80% OF

00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:18.456
DRIVERS OF THE VIOLATORS.

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:19.491
THAT'S THE ONLY BECOMES

00:29:19.557 --> 00:29:20.658
MEANINGLESS ENDANGERED

00:29:20.725 --> 00:29:22.127

CALLING THE POLICE TO ENFORCE

00:29:27.198 --> 00:29:28.399
UNREALISTICALLY LOW SPEED

00:29:28.466 --> 00:29:29.400
LIMITS OF ROADS THE TRUST

00:29:29.467 --> 00:29:30.635

CIRCUMSTANCES AND I DO BELIEVE

00:32:27.278 --> 00:32:28.413
THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR EACH CITY

COMMUNITIES AND STATES TRYING

00:32:48.199 --> 00:32:50.368
TO GET. PEOPLE OFF THE ROAD AND

00:32:50.435 --> 00:32:52.203

00:32:57.241 --> 00:32:58.876
THE PAST AND WE ALSO HAVE TO.

00:32:58.943 --> 00:33:00.311
TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION

00:33:00.378 --> 00:33:01.512
THAT THERE IS A LOT MORE PEOPLE

00:33:01.579 --> 00:33:03.681
BIKING AND WALKING AND THAT WAS

00:33:03.748 --> 00:33:05.083
OUR GOAL RIGHT TO GET PEOPLE

STARTS AT. FIVE POINT NINETEEN.

00:33:37.515 --> 00:33:39.884
WHERE IT TAKES THE SPEED LIMIT

00:33:39.951 --> 00:33:41.386
NEEDS TO BE ROUNDED UP TO THE

00:33:41.452 --> 00:33:43.020
HIGHEST THE NEAREST FIVE MILES

00:33:43.087 --> 00:33:44.856

POINT FOUR IS BELOW THIRTY TWO

00:34:16.187 --> 00:34:17.422

00:34:55.026 --> 00:34:55.827
BILL DID GIVE THEM MORE

00:34:55.893 --> 00:34:57.428
FLEXIBILITY TO LOWER IT EVEN

00:34:57.495 --> 00:34:59.730
MORE. BUT BUT BASED ON CONCERNS

00:34:59.797 --> 00:35:02.867
WE MADE THAT. A LOT MORE YOU

00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:04.702
KNOW WE COMPROMISE AND MADE IT

00:35:04.769 --> 00:35:05.603
TO WHERE IT WASN'T AS LARGE OF

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.705
A SWING. IN THE STAFF REPORT TO

00:35:07.772 --> 00:35:10.408
SAY GOOD JOB ABOUT TALKING THE

00:35:10.475 --> 00:35:11.909
CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE ON

00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:15.112
LOWERING SPEED LIMITS- WE'RE AS

00:35:15.179 --> 00:35:16.414
THE OPPOSITION IN THE CRATE

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:17.949
INDICATED THAT THERE'S NOW YOU

00:35:18.015 --> 00:35:20.151
COULD HAVE 6070% OF THE PEOPLE

00:35:20.218 --> 00:35:22.453
THAT MAYBE OUT LIARS. BECAUSE

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.187
OF THE WAY THAT THE STREETS

00:35:23.254 --> 00:35:26.724
DESIGNED- AND THAT WOULD CREATE

00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:30.995
THE STAFF REPORTS PARTS OUT

00:35:31.062 --> 00:35:33.464
MORE- PAST DISPARITY BETWEEN

00:35:33.531 --> 00:35:34.866
HOW FAST PEOPLE ARE DRIVING

00:35:34.932 --> 00:35:36.100
BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S GOING TWENTY

00:35:36.167 --> 00:35:37.301
MILES AN HOUR IN SOMEBODY'S

00:35:37.368 --> 00:35:38.603
GOING FORTY IN THE STREETS

00:35:38.669 --> 00:35:41.606
DESIGNED TO GO FORTY FIVE- CAN

00:35:41.672 --> 00:35:43.407
YOU ADRESS THAT CONCERN THAT

00:35:43.474 --> 00:35:45.176
THE OPPOSITION HAS. RAISED THAT

00:35:45.243 --> 00:35:46.677
WE MAY ACTUALLY INCREASE

00:35:46.744 --> 00:35:49.146
DISPARITY BECAUSE THE POSTED

00:35:49.213 --> 00:35:54.285
SIGN MAY BE- SIX IT IS

00:35:54.352 --> 00:35:56.521
SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW WHAT THE

00:35:56.587 --> 00:35:58.689
STREET DESIGN WAS AND WHAT THE

00:35:58.756 --> 00:36:00.892
DATA POINTS OUT OF HOW THE

00:36:00.958 --> 00:36:02.393
AVERAGE DRIVER DRIVES ALONG THE

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.028
STREET SO I HAVE LOOKED AT SOME

00:36:04.095 --> 00:36:05.863
OF THE DATA THAT SUGGESTED THAT

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:07.331
I ACTUALLY DON'T FIND IT VERY

00:36:07.398 --> 00:36:08.766
COMPELLING. THE IDEA THAT IF

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:10.301
YOU HAVE A SPEED LIMIT THAT'S

00:36:10.368 --> 00:36:11.302
TWENTY FIVE MILES AN HOU AND

00:36:11.369 --> 00:36:12.904
PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE GOING

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:14.205
THIRTEEN YOU'VE GOT SOME GOING

00:36:14.272 --> 00:36:14.872
FORTY FIVE MEANS THAT YOU'RE

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:15.973
GOING TO SOMEHOW COME OVER HERE

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.642
AND SOMEONE ELSE. OR THEY'RE

00:36:17.708 --> 00:36:18.543
GOING AT SUCH DIFFERENT SPEEDS

00:36:18.609 --> 00:36:19.744
THAT CAUSES ACCIDENTS I

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.312
PERSONALLY DON'T THINK IS

00:36:21.379 --> 00:36:23.347
REALLY BORN OUT IN THE DATA I-

00:36:23.414 --> 00:36:24.582
AND I THINK IT CERTAINLY WOULD

00:36:24.649 --> 00:36:25.483
BE IN A MUCH MORE EXTREME

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.218
SITUATION SOMEBODY GOING THIRTY

00:36:27.285 --> 00:36:28.019
FIVE MILES AN HOUR FREEWAY WITH

00:36:28.085 --> 00:36:29.520
THE- SPEED LIMIT IS SIXTY FIVE

00:36:29.587 --> 00:36:30.521
MILES AN HOUR COULD INDEED POSE

00:36:30.588 --> 00:36:32.256
A DANGER. BUT ON CITY SREETS

00:36:32.323 --> 00:36:34.225
THAT ARE NORMALLY TWENTY FIVE

00:36:34.292 --> 00:36:34.792
THIRTY THIRTY FIVE MILES AN

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:36.093
HOUR I JUST DON'T SEE THAT

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:36.894
DISCREPANCY YOU KNOW WE'RE

00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:38.963
TALKING. A LOT OF AREAS THAT

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.498
ARE HEAVILY POPULATED WHERE

00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:42.867
WOULD THIS PARTICULAR- SPEED

00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:44.769
LIMIT CHANGE WOULD AFFECT YOU

00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:46.304
KNOW THE BILL IS LIMITED TO

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:47.638
BUSINESS DISTRICT IT'S LIMITED

00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:48.773
TO AREAS THAT ARE HIGH INJURY

00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:50.141
ALREADY IT'S LIMITED TO AREAS

00:36:50.207 --> 00:36:50.841
WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF

00:36:50.908 --> 00:36:52.410
PEDESTRIANS OR CYCLISTS. YOU'RE

00:36:52.476 --> 00:36:53.477
NOT GOING TO HAVE THESE HUGE

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:55.479
VARIATIONS IN SPEED SORT OF

00:36:55.546 --> 00:36:57.415
PROGRAMMED INTO THOSE ROADS I

00:36:57.481 --> 00:36:58.616
CAN CERTAINLY SEE THAT IF ALL

00:36:58.683 --> 00:36:59.684
OF A SUDDEN OF A SECTION OF

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:00.918
HIGHWAY WITH A SPEED LIMIT

00:37:00.985 --> 00:37:02.687
CHANGES. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT

00:37:02.753 --> 00:37:06.791
THOSE CONDITIONS EXIST WHERE

00:37:06.857 --> 00:37:08.192
THIS BILL. TAKES EFFECT. MA'AM

00:37:08.259 --> 00:37:11.028
I THE BECAUSE- I THINK I

00:37:11.095 --> 00:37:12.930
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE- WHAT THE-

00:37:12.997 --> 00:37:14.298
ADVOCATES AND THE AUTHOR IS

00:37:14.365 --> 00:37:16.067
GETTING AT IS THAT THIS IS A-

00:37:16.133 --> 00:37:17.635
RATHER THAN CHANGING THE STREET

00:37:17.702 --> 00:37:19.804
SCAPE. INDUSTRY ENGINEERING. I

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:21.939
KNOW I COME FROM FREMONT. IT

00:37:22.006 --> 00:37:24.041
WAS DESIGNED. WITH THE IDEA

00:37:24.108 --> 00:37:24.775
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO

00:37:24.842 --> 00:37:26.243
FREEWAYS AND THERE ARE PLENTY

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.879
OF STREETS. WHERE YOU HAVE.

00:37:28.946 --> 00:37:30.781
FOUR LIGHTS AND YOU HAVE A-

00:37:30.848 --> 00:37:32.383
RIGHT HAND TURN LANE THAT YOU

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:33.684
DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SLOW DOWN

00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:35.319
YOU CAN GO AT FORTY FIVE MILES

00:37:35.386 --> 00:37:36.187
AN HOUR BECAUSE- THEY WERE

00:37:36.253 --> 00:37:37.622
EXPECTING PEOPLE BE WHISTLING

00:37:37.688 --> 00:37:39.357
OFF. ONE FREEWAY TO GET TO THE

00:37:39.423 --> 00:37:41.759
OTHER SO. THAT'S WHAT THE BUILD

00:37:41.826 --> 00:37:43.594
COMMUNITY IS IN THE STAFF

00:37:43.661 --> 00:37:45.463
REPORT. SEEMS TO POINT OUT THAT

00:37:45.529 --> 00:37:47.765
THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR. IN

00:37:47.832 --> 00:37:51.135
DETERMINING C. US. SPEED IS THE

00:37:51.202 --> 00:37:52.903
ST ENGINEERING AND WE HAVE A-

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:54.772
OUR PREVIOUS CHAIR. HAS

00:37:54.839 --> 00:37:56.107
AUTHORED A BILL THAT IS GOT A

00:37:56.173 --> 00:37:57.775
BOAT LOAD OF MONEY THAT'S GOING

00:37:57.842 --> 00:37:59.744
INTO LOCAL. DISTRICTS RIGHT NOW

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:01.946
AND THERE'S A LOT OF. BIKE

00:38:02.013 --> 00:38:03.414
LANES AND A LOT OF TRAFFIC

00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:06.283
CALMING THAT'S GOING ON-

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:07.985
THAT'S- THAT'S CHANGING THAT

00:38:08.052 --> 00:38:10.521
STREETSCAPE THAT'S GOING TO. TO

00:38:10.588 --> 00:38:12.056
GET THE SAME RESULTS I THINK

00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:13.424
THAT THE AUTHORS TRYING TO GET

00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:15.760
TO. THE CHALLENGES THAT I'M

00:38:15.826 --> 00:38:18.929
HAVING IS THAT. THOUGH WHICH

00:38:18.996 --> 00:38:20.698
COMES FIRST THE APPLE OR THE-

00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:21.966
CHICKEN OR THE EGG DO WE CHANGE

00:38:22.033 --> 00:38:23.034
THE STREET SCAPE AND THEN

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.969
REDUCE THE SPEEDS. ARE REDUCED

00:38:25.036 --> 00:38:28.105
TO SPEEDS. N. SITE PEOPLE AND-

00:38:28.172 --> 00:38:30.875
CREATE HIS DISPARITY SO THAT'S

00:38:30.941 --> 00:38:32.043
THAT'S- WHAT MY CONCERN IS IT'S

00:38:32.109 --> 00:38:34.345
NOT. IT'S NOT TRYING TO REDUCE

00:38:34.412 --> 00:38:35.746
THE THIRD OF THE DEATHS THAT

00:38:35.813 --> 00:38:37.348
OCCUR BY TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS

00:38:37.415 --> 00:38:38.716
RESULT OF SPEED. BECAUSE TWO

00:38:38.783 --> 00:38:40.418
THIRDS. ARE NOT BY SPEED SO WE

00:38:40.484 --> 00:38:41.952
GOT TO DEAL WITH THAT- WHAT HAS

00:38:42.019 --> 00:38:44.155
GIVEN ME- WE SPOKE WITH MANY

00:38:44.221 --> 00:38:46.390
AGENCIES. THE COMMITTEE MYSELF

00:38:46.457 --> 00:38:47.725
DIRECTLY- SPEAKING WITH MANY

00:38:47.792 --> 00:38:50.327
AGENCIES ONE IN PARTICULAR BAY

00:38:50.394 --> 00:38:51.962
AREA TRANSIT LOS ANGELES

00:38:52.029 --> 00:38:53.864
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION.

00:38:53.931 --> 00:38:56.333
ARE OF COURSE NEED THE SOLUTION

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.568
SO I THINK YOUR POINT WHAT

00:38:57.635 --> 00:38:59.236
THEY'RE LOOKING TO DO NOW AFTER

00:38:59.303 --> 00:39:00.971
THIS BILL IF IT SHOULD PASS A

00:39:01.038 --> 00:39:02.339
MOVE THROUGH AND BE SIGNED BY

00:39:02.406 --> 00:39:04.008
THE GOVERNOR. IS TO CREATE NEW

00:39:04.075 --> 00:39:09.013
STREETSCAPE IN. NEW ENGINEERING

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:09.647
AND DESIGNS AND PLANS. IN THEIR

00:39:09.714 --> 00:39:10.214
LOCAL. AND THAT'S WHAT THEY

00:39:10.281 --> 00:39:10.848
COMMITTED TO A SPA FOR PLACES

00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:11.982
LIKE SOUTH LOS ANGELES IT HAS

00:39:12.049 --> 00:39:13.284
SEEN. AN INCREASE IN

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.186
FATALITIES- THAT DEFINITELY

00:39:15.252 --> 00:39:16.987
NEEDS THAT THE SPEEDS LOWERED

00:39:17.054 --> 00:39:18.422
WITH THE COMP AND THEN TO

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:20.791
COMPLEMENT THE- THE- THE CHANGE

00:39:20.858 --> 00:39:22.793
IN ENGINEERING AND STREETSCAPE.

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:25.362
THOUGH MORE BOLD- YOU KNOW MORE

00:39:25.429 --> 00:39:27.164
STREET BALTIMORE- EITHER YOU

00:39:27.231 --> 00:39:29.166
KNOW INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES

00:39:29.233 --> 00:39:30.801
THAT WOULD HELP- EVEN FURTHER

00:39:30.868 --> 00:39:32.737
REDUCED SPEEDS IN AREAS THAT.

00:39:32.803 --> 00:39:33.838
MAYBE WERE INTENDED IT

00:39:33.904 --> 00:39:35.473
HISTORICALLY TO BE YOU KNOW

00:39:35.539 --> 00:39:38.109
FASTER SORT OF AREAS AROUND

00:39:38.175 --> 00:39:39.276
THREE WAYS IN WHICH ONE OF THEM

00:39:39.343 --> 00:39:40.745
ONE OF WHICH I LIVE. I THINK IT

00:39:40.811 --> 00:39:42.213
REALLY OKAY I THINK WE ALL HAVE

00:39:42.279 --> 00:39:43.781
THAT IN OUR DISTRICT RIGHT

00:39:43.848 --> 00:39:44.381
THANK YOU FOR THAT

00:39:44.448 --> 00:39:45.783
CLARIFICATION OF COURSE AND

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:47.852
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AS

00:39:47.918 --> 00:39:50.688
SENATOR BECKER. THANK YOU. I

00:39:50.755 --> 00:39:52.189
THINK THE AUTHOR OF I WILL BE

00:39:52.256 --> 00:39:52.923
SUPPORTING THIS BILL I HAD A

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:55.292
QUESTION AROUND. YOU IN GENERAL

00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:58.062
WE TRY TO. IF POSSIBLE DECREASE

00:39:58.129 --> 00:39:59.296
IN REACTION TO PEOPLE OF COLOR

00:39:59.363 --> 00:40:00.397
WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AND I'M

00:40:00.464 --> 00:40:01.932
JUST. HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT

00:40:01.999 --> 00:40:05.035
THIS BILL IN TERMS OF- THE TEND

00:40:05.102 --> 00:40:06.337
TO BE HIGHER POLICE PRESENCE IN

00:40:06.403 --> 00:40:06.804
TERMS IN LOW INCOME

00:40:06.871 --> 00:40:08.639
NEIGHBORHOODS AND HOW THEY CAN

00:40:08.706 --> 00:40:09.940
ACTUALLY INCREASE INTERACTION

00:40:10.007 --> 00:40:12.610
AND- AND- MAYBE INCREASE FINDS

00:40:12.676 --> 00:40:15.346
AN INCREASE- YOU KNOW ROUTE

00:40:15.412 --> 00:40:17.648
RESULTING. SITUATIONS WITH

00:40:17.715 --> 00:40:19.750
PEOPLE OF COLOR HOW DO YOU

00:40:19.817 --> 00:40:20.384
THINK ABOUT THAT IN THE CONTEXT

00:40:20.451 --> 00:40:22.653
OF THIS BILL. CHECK THE

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.654
QUESTION AND THAT'S CERTAINLY

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:25.389
THE CONCERN THAT THE ACLU I

00:40:25.456 --> 00:40:27.525
THINK WAS WAS VOICING. SO RIGHT

00:40:27.591 --> 00:40:29.760
NOW ON ANY GIVEN DAY WE ASSUME

00:40:29.827 --> 00:40:31.595
THAT ABOUT 15% OF PEOPLE ARE

00:40:31.662 --> 00:40:33.264
ACTUALLY SPEEDING- THEY MAY NOT

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:34.498
BE AGREE JUST A SPEEDING BUT

00:40:34.565 --> 00:40:35.466
THEY'RE SPENDING ENOUGH TO GET

00:40:35.533 --> 00:40:36.534
PULLED OVER BY LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.236
AND YET 50% OF PEOPLE DON'T GET

00:40:39.303 --> 00:40:41.272
PULLED OVER EVERY DAY- SO. IT

00:40:41.338 --> 00:40:42.706
MEANS TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU

00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:43.908
KNOW THIS WOULD INCREASE

00:40:43.974 --> 00:40:45.910
TICKETING REALLY THEY'RE GIVING

00:40:45.976 --> 00:40:47.511
TICKETS LEFT AND- POLICE

00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:48.612
OFFICERS HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO

00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:50.948
TAKE IT- IT'S NOT GOING TO GIVE

00:40:51.015 --> 00:40:51.615
THEM SORT OF MORE PEOPLE BUT IT

00:40:51.682 --> 00:40:54.852
DOES. ALLOW FOR SIGNAL TO BE

00:40:54.919 --> 00:40:58.088
SENT- SO. I THINK FIRST OF ALL

00:40:58.155 --> 00:40:59.056
OUR PROBLEMS REALLY WITH THE

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:00.124
FEE STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE ON

00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:01.492
TRAFFIC TICKETS WHICH ARE VERY

00:41:01.559 --> 00:41:03.194
PUNITIVE IN VERY HIGH. AND

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.962
DEFINITELY DISPROPORTIONATELY.

00:41:05.029 --> 00:41:06.463
HURT PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:07.631
ABILITY TO PAY THOSE TICKETS

00:41:07.698 --> 00:41:08.632
AND THAT'S FOR ALL TRAFFIC

00:41:08.699 --> 00:41:10.401
INFRACTIONS ACROSS THE BOARD.

00:41:10.467 --> 00:41:11.202
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

00:41:11.268 --> 00:41:12.736
SHOULD LOOK AT SEPARATELY JUST

00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:14.205
BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT. IN MANY

00:41:14.271 --> 00:41:15.973
CASES THE PENALTIES NOT FITTING

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.575
THE CRIME DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE

00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:18.609
JUST SAY WE'RE JUST NOT GONNA

00:41:18.676 --> 00:41:19.777
TAKE IT ANYMORE I THINK WE

00:41:19.844 --> 00:41:20.711
SHOULD REALLY SHOULD TAKE A

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:22.613
LOOK AT. WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.415
CHARGING AND HOW MANY FEES ARE

00:41:24.481 --> 00:41:25.850
TACKED ON TO THESE TICKETS THAT

00:41:25.916 --> 00:41:27.318
YOU KNOW. MAYBE ORIGINALLY WERE

00:41:27.384 --> 00:41:28.452
FIFTY DOLLARS BUT THEN YOU

00:41:28.519 --> 00:41:29.053
START PUTTING COURT FEES IN

00:41:29.119 --> 00:41:30.721
THIS FEE AND THAT FEE. THE NEXT

00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:31.722
THING YOU KNOW THEY'RE THREE

00:41:31.789 --> 00:41:32.456
FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS FIVE

00:41:32.523 --> 00:41:34.024
HUNDRED DOLLARS NOT FOR A LOW

00:41:34.091 --> 00:41:36.293
INCOME PERSON IS REALLY HARD.

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.661
THING TO OVERCOME SO I DO

00:41:37.728 --> 00:41:38.896
BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT

00:41:38.963 --> 00:41:40.164
THAT BUT I THINK THAT'S A

00:41:40.231 --> 00:41:41.999
SEPARATE ISSUE FROM THIS BILL.

00:41:42.066 --> 00:41:43.033
AND THEN SECONDLY THERE WAS A

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.602
COMPANION BILL TO THIS ABOUT

00:41:44.668 --> 00:41:46.003
AUTOMATED SPEED ENFORCEMENT.

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:47.037
THAT DID NOT MAKE IT THROUGH

00:41:47.104 --> 00:41:48.205
THE ASSEMBLY BUT I THINK THAT'S

00:41:48.272 --> 00:41:49.907
AN IMPORTANT PART. BECAUSE WHEN

00:41:49.974 --> 00:41:50.708
YOU HAVE THE AUTOMATED

00:41:50.774 --> 00:41:52.042
ENFORCEMENT PIECE YOU ARE ABLE

00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:53.444
TO REDUCE THOSE IN PERSON

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:55.913
INTERACTIONS. AND THOSE TICKETS

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.782
ARE MUCH LOWER THAN ANY TICKET

00:41:58.849 --> 00:42:00.417
THAT WILL BE GIVEN BY A LIVE

00:42:00.484 --> 00:42:02.286
OFFICER. SO I DO THINK THAT

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:03.687
CITIES NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF

00:42:03.754 --> 00:42:04.855
WHERE THEY'RE ENFORCING THEY

00:42:04.922 --> 00:42:05.856
SHOULD CERTAINLY BE ENFORCING

00:42:05.923 --> 00:42:06.991
IN AREAS WHERE THEY'RE TRYING

00:42:07.057 --> 00:42:08.525
TO BRING THE SPEED LIMITS DOWN.

00:42:08.592 --> 00:42:09.460
THEY ALSO HAVE TOOLS AT THEIR

00:42:09.526 --> 00:42:11.328
DISPOSAL IN MY CITY OF GLENDALE

00:42:11.395 --> 00:42:12.696
IT'S VERY COMMON THAT THEY WILL

00:42:12.763 --> 00:42:13.764
GIVE WARNINGS TO PEOPLE ON THE

00:42:13.831 --> 00:42:14.765
FIRST OFFENSE WHEN IT COMES TO

00:42:14.832 --> 00:42:15.866
SPEEDING. BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:42:15.933 --> 00:42:16.934
REALLY TRYING TO DO AN

00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:17.835
EDUCATION OUTREACH AND THIS IS

00:42:17.902 --> 00:42:19.570
A POLICY. THAT THEY DID

00:42:19.637 --> 00:42:22.706
DELIBERATELY TALKED ABOUT WITH

00:42:22.773 --> 00:42:23.274
THE CITY COUNCIL THAT PEOPLE

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.475
WHO ARE. NOT A- SPEED. BUT

00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:26.377
GOING. YOU KNOW. SEVEN TEN

00:42:26.443 --> 00:42:26.977
MILES AN HOUR OVER THE SPEED

00:42:27.044 --> 00:42:28.078
LIMIT IF THEY DON'T HAVE A

00:42:28.145 --> 00:42:30.547
PREVIOUS. INFRACTION IN A MANY

00:42:30.614 --> 00:42:31.582
TIMES IN GLENDALE THEY WILL GET

00:42:31.649 --> 00:42:33.017
A WARNING. SO THERE ARE

00:42:33.083 --> 00:42:34.418
POLICIES THAT CAN BE DONE BY

00:42:34.485 --> 00:42:35.653
CITIES WHO WANT TO ADDRESS.

00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:38.222
THIS CONCERN. BUT JUST BECAUSE

00:42:38.289 --> 00:42:39.156
WE ARE CHANGING THE THRESHOLD

00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:40.324
OF WHAT THE SPEED LIMIT IS.

00:42:40.391 --> 00:42:40.858
DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE

00:42:40.925 --> 00:42:42.326
NECESSARILY GOING TO HAVE MORE

00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:43.761
OFFICERS ON THE STREET OR MORE

00:42:43.827 --> 00:42:45.262
ENFORCEMENT I THINK THAT'S

00:42:45.329 --> 00:42:46.063
SOMETHING TO REALLY BE MINDFUL

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:50.034
OF- THERE DOES. THIS DOES THIS

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:51.502
BILL ISN'T THERE'S AN IN NO WAY

00:42:51.568 --> 00:42:52.803
WILL ENCOURAGE CITIES TO GO OUT

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:53.737
AND HIRE MORE MOTORCYCLE

00:42:53.804 --> 00:42:56.073
OFFICERS- SEND THEM TO

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:56.941
DIFFERENT AREAS IT'S REALLY

00:42:57.007 --> 00:42:58.008
GOING TO BE THE SAME

00:42:58.075 --> 00:42:59.643
ENFORCEMENT IN THE SAME AREAS.

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:00.945
BUT NOW THEY'LL HAVE THE TOOLS

00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:03.447
HOPEFULLY. TO SEND SIGNALS TO

00:43:03.514 --> 00:43:06.350
PEOPLE THAT THEY SHOULD BE

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:06.884
DRIVING AT A LOWER RATE OF

00:43:06.951 --> 00:43:09.553
SPEED IN AN AREA. WHAT THANK

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.488
YOU FOR THAT AND I MIGHT HOPE

00:43:11.555 --> 00:43:12.756
FOLKS WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

00:43:12.823 --> 00:43:14.792
THE WARNINGS THAT YOU MENTION-

00:43:14.858 --> 00:43:15.893
AND I DO HAVE A COURT FEE

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.094
WAIVER BILL THAT IS MAKING ITS

00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:18.963
WAY THROUGH OUR PROCESS HERE SO

00:43:19.029 --> 00:43:23.100
I APPRECIATE THAT- AS WELL ON-

00:43:23.167 --> 00:43:26.570
ON FEES- IN THE END- THAT YOU

00:43:26.637 --> 00:43:28.205
APPRECIATE YOU THINKING ABOUT

00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:29.873
THIS AND I DO BELIEVE WE SHOULD

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.909
TRY TO A LOOK AT THAT WE TALK

00:43:31.976 --> 00:43:34.445
ABOUT AUTOMATED SPEED- THEN

00:43:34.511 --> 00:43:35.612
THAT'S FINE WE LOOK AT THAT IF

00:43:35.679 --> 00:43:37.247
IT DOES HAVE LOWER TICKETS

00:43:37.314 --> 00:43:38.282
BECAUSE WE KNOW THE RED LIGHT

00:43:38.349 --> 00:43:40.451
CAMERAS HAVE MASSIVE FINES.

00:43:40.517 --> 00:43:41.852
WHICH AGAIN ARE DEEPLY DEEPLY

00:43:41.919 --> 00:43:42.987
INEQUITABLE SO I APPRECIATE

00:43:43.053 --> 00:43:46.991
YOU- I DO THINK WE SHOULD LOOK

00:43:47.057 --> 00:43:47.558
AT THAT ALL IN THE FUTURE SO

00:43:47.624 --> 00:43:48.592
THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN A FIGHT

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:49.626
MAY I CENTER BECKER THIS

00:43:49.693 --> 00:43:50.995
COMMITTEE I WOULD SAY DOES A

00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:52.229
PRETTY GOOD JOB OF ENSURING

00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:53.597
THAT WERE NOT BEING AS PUNITIVE

00:43:53.664 --> 00:43:55.099
BUT THAT WERE BEING- MORE

00:43:55.165 --> 00:43:56.533
EQUITABLE IN THE WAY THAT

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:57.501
WE'RE- IMPLEMENTING FEE

00:43:57.568 --> 00:43:59.503
STRUCTURES- YOU'LL SEE THAT AND

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.138
MANY OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS

00:44:01.205 --> 00:44:01.905
AND SO THE COMMITTEE

00:44:01.972 --> 00:44:02.806
CONSULTANTS HAVE DONE A GREAT

00:44:02.873 --> 00:44:05.009
JOB. OF THAT- I DON'T SEE ANY

00:44:05.075 --> 00:44:06.777
OTHER MIKES UP AT ALL JUST.

00:44:06.844 --> 00:44:08.979
CLOSE BY SAYING- YOU STARTED AT

00:44:09.046 --> 00:44:10.447
A VERY COLLABORATIVE SPACE AND

00:44:10.514 --> 00:44:11.415
THIS IS WHAT I APPRECIATE ABOUT

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:13.384
THIS BILL THAT YOU HAD. STARTED

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:14.251
WITH THE VISION ZERO TASK

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:16.220
FORCE. COLLABORATIVE IN MANY

00:44:16.286 --> 00:44:18.022
SPACES EQUITY PARTNERS LAW

00:44:18.088 --> 00:44:19.523
ENFORCEMENT ALL THE PLAYERS

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:21.558
WERE AT THE TABLE. AND WE HEARD

00:44:21.625 --> 00:44:23.227
FROM MANY OF THEM. AND AGAIN

00:44:23.293 --> 00:44:24.561
THIS IS HOPEFULLY WILL

00:44:24.628 --> 00:44:26.430
ENCOURAGE PLANS FOR THE LOCALS

00:44:26.497 --> 00:44:27.631
TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THEIR

00:44:27.698 --> 00:44:29.066
STREETSCAPES IF THEY IF THEY

00:44:29.133 --> 00:44:30.401
NEED TO. WHICH IS THE MOST

00:44:30.467 --> 00:44:31.335
IMPORTANT THING IS TO

00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:32.803
INTERCHANGE THE ENGINEERING IF

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:33.971
NEED BE. TO ENSURE THAT

00:44:34.038 --> 00:44:36.573
REDUCING TRAFFIC FATALITIES. SO

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:37.775
THANK YOU FOR THE BILL I SAID

00:44:37.841 --> 00:44:38.909
CERTAINLY SUPPORTED AND IF

00:44:38.976 --> 00:44:39.843
YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE A FAMILY

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:40.944
MEMBER WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT.

00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:42.146
I WOULD JUST SAY DO IT JUST TO

00:44:42.212 --> 00:44:43.347
KEEP IN MIND THAT THE SPEED

00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:45.149
LIMITS OUR- SERVER PURPOSE

00:44:45.215 --> 00:44:46.850
THEY'RE THERE FOR A REASON-

00:44:46.917 --> 00:44:48.252
AND- IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE

00:44:48.318 --> 00:44:49.420
REVIEW WHAT THEIR FUNCTION IS

00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:50.988
AND HOW THEY WORK. THE END

00:44:51.055 --> 00:44:52.523
ROADS WERE DESIGNED AT A TIME

00:44:52.589 --> 00:44:54.458
WHEN CARS WENT SLOWER. THEY

00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:55.526
FELT LIKE THEY WERE GOING

00:44:55.592 --> 00:44:56.927
FASTER THEY WERE FOR THE

00:44:56.994 --> 00:44:59.196
OCCUPANT. AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY

00:44:59.263 --> 00:45:00.431
IMPORTANT AS THE OPPOSITION

00:45:00.497 --> 00:45:02.433
RAISE THAT CITIES FOCUS ON ST

00:45:02.499 --> 00:45:04.201
ENGINEERING THAT IS KEY. BUT

00:45:04.268 --> 00:45:05.335
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE LAW NOW

00:45:05.402 --> 00:45:06.437
THAT REWARDS THAT INVESTMENT

00:45:06.503 --> 00:45:07.538
WOULD BE ABILITY TO CAPTURE

00:45:07.604 --> 00:45:10.074
LOWER SPEED LIMITS. ALONG WITH

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:10.808
THAT AND ALL OF THESE

00:45:10.874 --> 00:45:12.776
DIFFERENT. MODALITIES NEED TO

00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:14.645
BE SEEN IN CONCERT TOGETHER.

00:45:14.711 --> 00:45:16.814
THE ENFORCEMENT THE EDUCATION.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.116
BUT ALSO. THE SPEED LIMITS THEY

00:45:19.183 --> 00:45:20.284
ALL HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY AND

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:21.285
CITIES FOR YEARS HAVE BEEN

00:45:21.351 --> 00:45:24.054
STYMIED BY THIS. THIS BEING

00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:26.123
FORCED TO RAISE SPEED LIMITS TO

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:28.025
ACCOMMODATE SPEEDING DRIVERS

00:45:28.092 --> 00:45:30.694
AND FASTER CARS. CARS AND FUEL

00:45:30.761 --> 00:45:32.262
MAKE THE ROOM FEEL SAFER THAN

00:45:32.329 --> 00:45:33.997
IT ACTUALLY IS. AND THE RESULT

00:45:34.064 --> 00:45:35.933
HAS BEEN ANINCREASE IN DEATHS

00:45:35.999 --> 00:45:37.000
PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLIST DEATHS

00:45:37.067 --> 00:45:38.535
CONSISTENTLY. OVER THE PAST

00:45:38.602 --> 00:45:40.871
SEVERAL YEARS. IF WE HAVE FOUR

00:45:40.938 --> 00:45:41.705
THOUSAND PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA

00:45:41.772 --> 00:45:42.773
DYING EVERY YEAR IN PLANE

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.907
CRASHES WOULD PROBABLY GROUND

00:45:43.974 --> 00:45:44.975
THE FLEET IN A MINUTE. BUT

00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:48.879
SOMEHOW WE. ACCEPT THAT WHEN IT

00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:49.513
COMES TO PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:50.347
FATALITIES- AND WITH THAT I DID

00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:51.815
IS ONE PIECE OF THAT PUZZLE AND

00:45:51.882 --> 00:45:53.317
I URGE MY VOTE. THANK YOU THANK

TO A MIDDLE SCHOOL. THIS IS

01:41:23.243 --> 01:41:23.710
BECAUSE WE HAVE AN ILLEGAL

01:41:23.777 --> 01:41:28.115
INDUSTRY. WE ARE PREVENTING THE

01:41:28.182 --> 01:41:29.750
LEGAL INDUSTRY WHICH DOES NOT

01:41:29.817 --> 01:41:31.485
SELL TO CHILDREN FROM

01:41:31.552 --> 01:41:34.188
FLOURISHING IF WE KEEP THIS BAN

01:41:34.254 --> 01:41:38.692

I WOULD JUST ASK YOU TO HELP US

01:41:41.829 --> 01:41:45.766
SUPPORT THE LEGAL INDUSTRY.

01:41:45.833 --> 01:41:47.634
I'LL ALSO POINT OUT THAT WHAT

01:41:47.701 --> 01:41:48.869
CAN BE PUT ON THESE BILLS

01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:51.405
BILLBOARDS IS HIGHLY REGULATED

01:41:51.472 --> 01:41:52.306
NOTHING THAT APPEAL TO CHILDREN

01:41:52.372 --> 01:41:55.809
CAN DO IT FURTHERMORE 72% OF

01:41:55.876 --> 01:41:57.845
THE PEOPLE WHO THE REGULATION

01:41:57.911 --> 01:42:00.314
IS SUCH THAT 72% AT LEAST OF

01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:01.982
THE PEOPLE WHO SEE THIS HAVE TO

01:42:02.049 --> 01:42:07.521
BE ADULTS- WE BELIEVE. THAT IT

01:42:07.588 --> 01:42:09.323
IS VERY ARD TO INTERPRET. A

01:42:09.389 --> 01:42:11.792
BILL WHICH AS YOU CAN ADVERTISE

01:42:11.859 --> 01:42:13.660
ON THE STATE HIGHWAY. THAT

01:42:13.727 --> 01:42:14.995
CROSSES THE BORDER WHEN NO

01:42:15.062 --> 01:42:17.664
STATE HIGHWAY DOES. WE DON'T

01:42:17.731 --> 01:42:20.033
THINK THAT WHOEVER PUT THAT IN.

01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:25.539
HAD ANY INTENTION OF ALLOWING-

01:42:25.606 --> 01:42:29.042
THE ADVERTISEMENTS ON THE FOUR

01:42:29.109 --> 01:42:29.643
OH FIVE FOUR EIGHTY EIGHTY BUT

01:42:29.710 --> 01:42:32.679
NOT ON EIGHTY FOUR NOT ON FIVE.

01:42:32.746 --> 01:42:34.815
SO WHAT'S THERE IT'S VERY HARD

01:42:34.882 --> 01:42:38.151
TO INTERPRET WE THINK THAT THE-

01:42:38.218 --> 01:42:41.288
AGENCY IN CHARGE GOT THIS RIGHT

01:42:41.355 --> 01:42:42.089
WHICH IS WHY WE'RE PROPOSING

01:42:42.155 --> 01:42:44.992
THIS. AND AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW

01:42:45.058 --> 01:42:46.793
WHAT WHOEVER PUT THAT IN HAD

01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:48.495
MINE BECAUSE IT SIMPLY WASN'T.

01:42:48.562 --> 01:42:51.131
PUT DOWN. HAVING GONE THROUGH A

01:42:51.198 --> 01:42:52.866
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS I DOUBT

01:42:52.933 --> 01:42:54.468
ANYTHING WITHOUT WORDING WOULD

01:42:54.535 --> 01:42:57.404
HAVE GOT THROUGH. SO I THANK

01:42:57.471 --> 01:42:58.505
YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

01:42:58.572 --> 01:42:59.907
ATTENTION- WHEN THERE WERE ALSO

01:42:59.973 --> 01:43:02.543
SOME STUDIES ABOUT THIS AND

01:43:02.609 --> 01:43:05.612
THAT AND CLAIMS- I COULD JUST

01:43:05.679 --> 01:43:07.414
SAY THAT CORRELATION IS NOT THE

01:43:07.481 --> 01:43:10.050
SAME AS CAUSATION. I CAN SAY

01:43:10.117 --> 01:43:11.818
THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF STUDIES

01:43:11.885 --> 01:43:14.087
THAT SHOW IN FACT THAT CANNABIS

01:43:14.154 --> 01:43:17.925
IS NOT- SOMETHING WHICH- ARE

01:43:17.991 --> 01:43:19.493
IMPAIRED DRIVERS SHOULD ANYWAY

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:22.696

01:43:22.763 --> 01:43:25.465
THAT ALCOHOL DOES. I COULD SURE

01:43:25.532 --> 01:43:26.833
USE STUDIES AND ALL SORTS OF

01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:28.268
THINGS BUT RIGHT NOW WHAT I'M

01:43:28.335 --> 01:43:29.870
ASKING IS THAT WE SUPPORT THE

01:43:29.937 --> 01:43:31.905
LEGAL INDUSTRY SO WILL OUT

THEN THEY HAVE ALTERNATIVE FUEL

02:05:50.776 --> 02:05:52.611
PRODUCTION THAT'S WHAT I WOULD

02:05:52.678 --> 02:05:53.779

NOW I'M ON THE- PAGE ELEVEN OF

02:06:05.491 --> 02:06:08.127
THE BILL THIS IS STARTS UP WITH

IS APPROPRIATED. THROUGH THIS

02:06:18.737 --> 02:06:21.473
ALTERNATIVE FUEL PUMP PRODUCT

02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:22.675

COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME

02:06:26.645 --> 02:06:29.315
CALIFORNIANS AND AT LEAST 50%

02:06:29.381 --> 02:06:31.917
OF THOSE LOW LOCATION BASED

02:06:31.984 --> 02:06:32.851
INVESTMENTS THAT CAN BE

02:06:32.918 --> 02:06:35.354
EXPANDED. IN DISADVANTAGED IN

02:06:35.421 --> 02:06:39.224
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES SO I SEE

02:06:39.291 --> 02:06:41.560
THE VALUE IN THE LOCATION OF

02:06:41.627 --> 02:06:43.162
ZEV CHARGING STATIONS AND ALL

02:06:43.228 --> 02:06:44.797
THAT I'M LOOKING AT THE FUEL

02:06:44.863 --> 02:06:48.100
PRODUCTION BECAUSE AT LEAST. IN

02:06:48.167 --> 02:06:49.969
THE BAY AREA WE HAVE BECAUSE OF

02:06:50.035 --> 02:06:51.904
A COASTAL BREEZE WE HAVE A LOT

02:06:51.971 --> 02:06:53.505
OF AREAS WHERE THEY HAVE A

02:06:53.572 --> 02:06:56.342
REFINERY THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY

02:06:56.408 --> 02:06:58.310
FALL INTO A QUOTE UNQUOTE.

02:06:58.377 --> 02:06:59.912
ENVIRO SCREEN DISADVANTAGED

02:06:59.979 --> 02:07:00.980
COMMUNITIES WERE TRYING TO GET

02:07:01.046 --> 02:07:03.649
DIFFERENT DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS

02:07:03.716 --> 02:07:05.851
SO THAT. AND THEN I GUESS AT

02:07:05.918 --> 02:07:07.820
SOME UNIVERSITIES OR SOMEBODY

02:07:07.886 --> 02:07:10.522
WHO'S LOOKING TO ALT TO DEVELOP

02:07:10.589 --> 02:07:12.458
ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND HAS. HAS

02:07:12.524 --> 02:07:14.360
INVESTED IN ALTERNATIVE FUELS

02:07:14.426 --> 02:07:15.761
THAT WAS WORKING WITH UC

02:07:15.828 --> 02:07:18.731
RIVERSIDE OR UC DAVIS FARMERS

02:07:18.797 --> 02:07:22.835

02:07:22.901 --> 02:07:24.870
IN THE QUOTE UNQUOTE.

02:07:24.937 --> 02:07:26.405
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BUT

02:07:26.472 --> 02:07:27.539
THAT'S THE FIGHT IS DEFINED BY

02:07:27.606 --> 02:07:30.242
THE BY THE ENVIRO SCREEN SO

02:07:30.309 --> 02:07:32.978

WOULD NOT BE ENTITLED TO ANY OF

02:07:39.785 --> 02:07:41.620
THIS MONEY FOR THE ALTERNATIVE

02:07:41.687 --> 02:07:44.289
FUEL PRODUCTION. NOT THE BUT

02:07:44.356 --> 02:07:45.724
THE LOCATION OF THE THINGS BUT

02:07:45.791 --> 02:07:47.226
THE ACTUAL PRODUCTION BECAUSE

02:07:47.292 --> 02:07:50.362
SOME OF THAT STUFF. IS NOT EASY

02:07:50.429 --> 02:07:53.332
TO MOVE. AND I WOULD WONDER IF

YOU SENATOR MURKOWSKI FOR THOSE

02:08:12.985 --> 02:08:15.054
QUESTIONS SO. ONE THING OF NOTE

02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:16.488
IS THAT THE CURRENT 20%

02:08:16.555 --> 02:08:18.624
REQUIREMENT. IS FOR LIGHT DUTY

02:08:18.690 --> 02:08:21.326
HYDROGEN FUELING- AND SO

02:08:21.393 --> 02:08:23.462
FUELING STATION LOCATED IN A

02:08:23.529 --> 02:08:25.330
DISADVANTAGE FOR LOW INCOME

02:08:25.397 --> 02:08:28.333
COMMUNITY. WOULD COUNT TOWARDS

02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:30.636
THAT 50% OF PHYSICAL

02:08:30.702 --> 02:08:31.703
INVESTMENTS LOCATED IN ONE OF

02:08:31.770 --> 02:08:33.505
THOSE COMMUNITIES SO.

02:08:33.572 --> 02:08:35.507
NOTEWORTHY THAT IT IS NOT JUST

02:08:35.574 --> 02:08:37.076
D. A. SEES AS DEFINED BY

02:08:37.142 --> 02:08:38.544
CAROLINE VIRUS SCREEN BUT ALSO

02:08:38.610 --> 02:08:41.447
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. AND WE

02:08:41.513 --> 02:08:44.116
RECOGNIZE THAT NOT ALL- PROGRAM

02:08:44.183 --> 02:08:45.984
EXPENDITURES YOU KNOW HOW THIS

02:08:46.051 --> 02:08:48.620
LOCATION BASED ELEMENT. AND SO

02:08:48.687 --> 02:08:49.121
THAT'S WHY WE'RE GIVING

02:08:49.188 --> 02:08:50.956
GUIDANCE TO THE COMMISSION BUT

02:08:51.023 --> 02:08:52.558
IF THIS IS SOME TANGIBLE

02:08:52.624 --> 02:08:54.893
LOCATION BASED INVESTMENT. BUT

02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:56.562
YOU LOOK AT ON BALANCE OVER

02:08:56.628 --> 02:08:59.331
MULTIPLE YEARS PUTTING 50% OF

02:08:59.398 --> 02:09:00.032
THE FUNDS INTO THOSE

02:09:00.099 --> 02:09:02.000
COMMUNITIES. SO WE HOPE THAT

02:09:02.067 --> 02:09:03.068
WILL STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE

02:09:03.135 --> 02:09:04.870
AND ENSURE THAT THOSE REALLY

02:09:04.937 --> 02:09:06.705
CRITICAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS AT

02:09:06.772 --> 02:09:09.775
THOSE UNIVERSITIES- THAT AREN'T

02:09:09.842 --> 02:09:11.844
TANGIBLE LOCATION BASED.

02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:12.311
WOULDN'T COUNT IN THAT

02:09:12.377 --> 02:09:14.446
CALCULATION- AND WE'RE ALSO

02:09:14.513 --> 02:09:16.014
PROVIDING IN THE BILL THAT BOTH

02:09:16.081 --> 02:09:18.517
THE EXISTING PROGRAM ADVISORY

02:09:18.584 --> 02:09:20.018
BOARD AND THE DISADVANTAGED

02:09:20.085 --> 02:09:21.053
COMMUNITIES ADVISORY BOARD TO

02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:22.855
HELP THE COMMISSION. FURTHER

02:09:22.921 --> 02:09:29.161
INTERPRET- WHAT. QUALIFIES. FOR

02:09:29.228 --> 02:09:29.761
BOTH OF THOSE 50% PROVISIONS.

02:09:29.828 --> 02:09:31.196
OKAY YEAH BECAUSE I MEAN I GET

02:09:31.263 --> 02:09:33.398
THE HYDROGEN FUEL STATIONS

02:09:33.465 --> 02:09:35.134
THAT'S ALRIGHT BUT SOME OF THE

02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:36.435
ACTUAL PRODUCTION AND THAT

02:09:36.502 --> 02:09:37.636
RESEARCH PORTION OF THE

02:09:37.703 --> 02:09:40.172
PRODUCTION. I CAN'T BELIEVE

02:09:40.239 --> 02:09:41.607
THAT ANYBODY WOULD WANT TO STOP

02:09:41.673 --> 02:09:43.475
RIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR

02:09:43.542 --> 02:09:45.410
CLOTHES AND SO. I FEEL A LITTLE

02:09:45.477 --> 02:09:48.780
BIT BETTER ON THAT- SINCE. WITH

02:09:48.847 --> 02:09:50.983
THAT CLARIFICATION AND I HOPE

02:09:51.049 --> 02:09:53.752
THAT EVERYBODY SEES THAT THAT'S

02:09:53.819 --> 02:09:56.088
THAT WE DON'T IMPEDE THAT. THE

02:09:56.155 --> 02:09:57.489
ALTERNATE FUEL PRODUCTION WHICH

02:09:57.556 --> 02:09:58.724
IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO

02:09:58.790 --> 02:10:00.192
MEET. THESE GOALS WHATEVER IT
