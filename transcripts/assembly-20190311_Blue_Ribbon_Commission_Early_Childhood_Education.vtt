FOR ALL OF THE KIDS TO BE

00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:27.438
PREPARED SO THAT THEY CAN BE

00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:29.440
SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL AND NOT

ONLY FOR THE CHILDREN BUT FOR

00:33:30.641 --> 00:33:31.876

00:33:43.554 --> 00:33:44.522
MOST.

00:33:44.589 --> 00:33:45.957
BECAUSE THE FACE OF TOWN THE

00:33:46.023 --> 00:33:47.992
CHALLENGING --

00:33:48.059 --> 00:33:51.863
LIVES OF KIDS ARE BECAUSE OF

00:33:51.929 --> 00:33:53.264
POVERTY AND I THINK THAT WITH A

00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:54.632

THOSE ARE THE TOOLS I HAVE TWO

00:33:59.704 --> 00:34:02.473

WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE TOO

00:34:11.749 --> 00:34:13.017
MANY OF THE MOST VULNERABLE

00:34:13.084 --> 00:34:15.153
CHILDREN DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:16.788
HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS AND THE

00:34:16.854 --> 00:34:18.322
KEY HERE AND I THINK THROUGHOUT --

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:20.658

00:39:14.452 --> 00:39:16.020
FAMILIES ISOLATED OR THE CENTERS

00:39:16.087 --> 00:39:17.221
ARE ISOLATED.

00:39:17.288 --> 00:39:18.355

PUBLIC ABOUT OUR CONCLUSIONS.

00:41:40.231 --> 00:41:41.398
THE ROUTE THE BLUE RIBBON

00:41:41.465 --> 00:41:43.434
COMMISSION HEARD FROM A NUMBER

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.436
OF EXPERTS WE KNOW THAT PARENTS

00:41:45.502 --> 00:41:47.137
OF PROVIDERS HAVE EXPERTISE AS

00:41:47.204 --> 00:41:49.740
IMPORTANT AS ANY ACADEMIC OR

00:41:49.807 --> 00:41:51.141
GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATOR HAS.

00:41:51.208 --> 00:41:54.044
SO WE MADE SURE THAT YOU WERE

00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:54.578
INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS.

00:41:54.645 --> 00:41:55.946
THE TOPIC OF EARLY CHILDHOOD

00:41:56.013 --> 00:41:57.915
EDUCATION IS RARELY FAR FROM MY

00:41:57.982 --> 00:42:00.050
MIND FOR TWO REASONS AS HAS BEEN

00:42:00.117 --> 00:42:00.885
STATED.

00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:02.820
PREVIOUSLY THAT'S WHY I RAN FOR

00:42:02.887 --> 00:42:04.021
OFFICE IT IT'S A FIELD IN WHICH

00:42:04.088 --> 00:42:05.990
I SPENT.

00:42:06.056 --> 00:42:06.590
THE FIRST TWENTY YEARS OF MY

00:42:06.657 --> 00:42:07.491
CAREER.

00:42:07.558 --> 00:42:09.026
IT UNDERPINS --

00:42:09.093 --> 00:42:12.229
IT ALSO DEPENDS SO MUCH OF WISH

00:42:12.296 --> 00:42:14.131
AS A SOCIETY I'M GLAD THAT WE

00:42:14.198 --> 00:42:15.332
HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO RECOGNIZES

00:42:15.399 --> 00:42:16.467
THAT.

00:42:16.533 --> 00:42:17.735
I SPOKE TO A GROUP OF YOUNG

00:42:17.801 --> 00:42:20.337
POLITICAL SCIENCE STUDENTS LAST

00:42:20.404 --> 00:42:20.871
WEEK I BELIEVE IT WAS LAST

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:22.072
WEDNESDAY.

00:42:22.139 --> 00:42:24.675
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WHOSE SOLE

00:42:24.742 --> 00:42:26.176
GOAL WAS TO SHAPE THE FUTURE.

00:42:26.243 --> 00:42:27.945
I SHARED WITH THEM THAT MY

00:42:28.012 --> 00:42:29.213
CONVICTION THAT IT'S EARLY

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.448
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION THAT TURNS

00:42:31.515 --> 00:42:32.516
AROUND COMMUNITIES.

00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:34.518
IT'S EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION

00:42:34.585 --> 00:42:37.154
THAT BREAKS THE CYCLE OF POVERTY

00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:39.089
IN FAMILIES IT'S EARLY CHILDHOOD

00:42:39.156 --> 00:42:40.724
EDUCATION THAT I THINK IS THE

00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:42.893
MOST IMPORTANT SOCIAL SERVICE

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:43.627
PROGRAM.

00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:45.796
AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM THAT WE

00:42:45.863 --> 00:42:46.864
CAN OFFER.

00:42:46.931 --> 00:42:48.098
IT'S HOW YOU GIVES CHILDREN A

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:08.371
CULTURE APPROPRIATE WAYS.

00:55:08.438 --> 00:55:10.473
THE LAST NAVIGATION --

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:14.711
LAST WHAT'S UP LIFT IS REGARDING

00:55:14.778 --> 00:55:16.112
AROUND QUEER FAMILIES ARE

00:55:16.179 --> 00:55:17.647
FAMILIES DON'T THAT DON'T FIT

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:19.816
INTO THE MOTHER FATHER TO PEER

00:55:19.883 --> 00:55:21.384
FAMILY BOX.

00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:21.985
ON THIS IS SOMETHING WE DON'T

00:55:22.052 --> 00:55:23.920
HEAR MUCH ABOUT BUT I MYSELF

00:55:23.987 --> 00:55:25.021
HAVE FILLED OUT FORMS AROUND

00:55:25.088 --> 00:55:26.456
CHILDCARE SEEN THE WORDS MOTHER

00:55:26.523 --> 00:55:27.090
FATHER.

00:55:27.157 --> 00:55:28.858
SO FOR PARENTS WHO ARE NON

00:55:28.925 --> 00:55:30.760
BINARY WE'RE TRANCE MIGHT BE A

00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:32.629
GRANDMA WHO MIGHT BE A FOSTER

00:55:32.696 --> 00:55:33.663
PARENT.

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:36.332
THESE FORMS IN THESE WORDS APPLY

00:55:36.399 --> 00:55:36.766

00:55:36.833 --> 00:55:37.667

00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:38.501
I KNOW THAT --

00:55:38.568 --> 00:55:39.869
THERE WAS THE L. G. B. T. JUST

00:55:39.936 --> 00:55:41.838
CUTE DISPARITIES ACT THAT

THOUSANDS OF PARENTS WHO HAVE

STRUGGLED WITH CHILD CARE TO

00:56:55.712 --> 00:56:56.913
CONTINUE EMPLOYMENT.

00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:57.781
OF OUR DREAM CARE SYSTEM WOULD

00:56:57.847 --> 00:56:59.315
BE FOR THERE TO BE NO WAITING

00:56:59.382 --> 00:57:00.683
LIST BECAUSE NO PARENT HAS THE

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:02.252
LUXURY OF WAITING TO GO BACK TO

00:57:02.318 --> 00:57:03.119
WORK.

00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:04.521
SOMETIMES THERE ARE SOME

00:57:04.587 --> 00:57:06.589
CHILDREN WHO WOULD GET AXES BUT

00:57:06.656 --> 00:57:08.491
OTHERS IN THE HOUSEHOLD WHAT IT

00:57:08.558 --> 00:57:08.958
SO THIS WOULD BE IN MY

00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:10.760
EXPERIENCE --

00:57:10.827 --> 00:57:12.529
BECAUSE OF MY MY DAUGHTER MY SON

00:57:12.595 --> 00:57:14.564
HAVE A TWO YEAR AGE DIFFERENCE

00:57:14.631 --> 00:57:17.000
SO DEPENDING ON THE AGES THEY

00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:17.700
HAVE.

00:57:17.767 --> 00:57:18.568
MORE --

00:57:18.635 --> 00:57:20.737
AVAILABILITY SO MY SON WAS ABLE

00:57:20.804 --> 00:57:22.972
TO GET AFTER --

00:57:23.039 --> 00:57:25.141
A FIVE MONTH WAITING WHEN I

00:57:25.208 --> 00:57:26.876
MOVED HE WAS ABLE TO GET CHILD

00:57:26.943 --> 00:57:28.378
CARE BUT MY DAUGHTER WHAT IT SO

00:57:28.444 --> 00:57:29.279
THEN -- THAT

00:57:29.345 --> 00:57:32.448
JUST ADDS STRUGGLE ON TOP OF NOT

00:57:32.515 --> 00:57:35.251
BEING ABLE. TO TO MAKE ENDS MEET

00:57:35.318 --> 00:57:36.686
AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:57:36.753 --> 00:57:37.887
YOUR CHILDREN ARE GETTING

00:57:37.954 --> 00:57:40.190
EDUCATION THAT THEY'RE SAFE FOR

00:57:40.256 --> 00:57:41.424
YOUR OWN WORK --

00:57:41.491 --> 00:57:42.458
BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO

00:57:42.525 --> 00:57:43.560
PROVIDE FOR THEM WE NEED TO WORK

00:57:43.626 --> 00:57:44.961
FOR THEM NEED TO FEED THEM.

00:57:45.028 --> 00:57:47.463
SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS I

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:50.867
WAS DONE BECAUSE ONE GETS IT

00:57:50.934 --> 00:57:52.268
THAT'S A GREAT THING YOU KNOW

00:57:52.335 --> 00:57:53.603
BUT IT'S STILL PUTS THAT

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:56.439
PRESSURE ON YOU --

00:57:56.506 --> 00:57:57.941
THAT FINANCIAL PRESSURE.

00:57:58.007 --> 00:58:00.176
SO I KNOW THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF

00:58:00.243 --> 00:58:01.311
THE HOW IT IS OF BEING ON

00:58:01.377 --> 00:58:02.846
EXPERIENCE OF A WAITING LIST AND

00:58:02.912 --> 00:58:03.980
I KNOW THE STRUGGLE IN THE

00:58:04.047 --> 00:58:05.315
FINANCIAL STRUGGLE.

00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:06.749
IT WAS EITHER PAY RENT OR PAY

00:58:06.816 --> 00:58:08.351
CHILD CARE I KNOW MANY PARENTS

00:58:08.418 --> 00:58:11.087
WHO CANNOT EVEN AFFORD TO WORK.

00:58:11.154 --> 00:58:12.355
FOR MONTHS I HAD TO PAY OUT OF

00:58:12.422 --> 00:58:14.123
POCKET AND AFTER MY RIGHT IT WAS

00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:15.491
NEARLY --

00:58:15.558 --> 00:58:17.060
THE REST OF MY PAYCHECK SO I

00:58:17.126 --> 00:58:19.095
REALLY WHAT I HAVE TO DO IS AS

00:58:19.162 --> 00:58:21.164
WE KNOW YOU HAVE TO WORK TO GET

00:58:21.231 --> 00:58:22.198
TO WHERE YOU CAN'T JUST.

00:58:22.265 --> 00:58:24.100
DO SO ONLY EDUCATION AND THEN

00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:25.335
EXPECT TO HAVE YOUR DREAM JOB

00:58:25.401 --> 00:58:26.970
YOU HAVE TO WORK YOUR WAY UP

00:58:27.036 --> 00:58:28.538
ALONG WITH SCHOOL.

00:58:28.605 --> 00:58:30.540
SO IN ORDER FOR ME TO EVEN SAY

00:58:30.607 --> 00:58:32.175
OKAY I HAVE A SHOT OF DOING WHAT

00:58:32.242 --> 00:58:33.943
I WANT TO DO AND PROVIDE FOR MY

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:35.812
FAMILY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT.

00:58:35.879 --> 00:58:36.412
IN THE MEANWHILE I HAVE TO BE

00:58:36.479 --> 00:58:38.681
WORKING SO FOR ME TO GET THERE I

00:58:38.748 --> 00:58:40.817
HAVE TO PAY BASICALLY.

00:58:40.884 --> 00:58:42.652
PACE SO THAT I COULD CONTINUE TO

00:58:42.719 --> 00:58:44.320
WORK SO I COULD GET SOMEWHERE

00:58:44.387 --> 00:58:45.722
AND HAVE MY MY LITTLE ONES BEING

00:58:45.788 --> 00:58:46.990
TAKEN CARE.

00:58:47.056 --> 00:58:48.358
I LIVED IN AN AREA WHERE THERE

00:58:48.424 --> 00:58:50.026
WERE ONLY TWO LICENSED FAMILY

00:58:50.093 --> 00:58:52.262
CHILD CARE PROVIDERS SO THOSE

00:58:52.328 --> 00:58:54.230
WERE ONLY OPTIONS AND THAT'S IF

00:58:54.297 --> 00:58:57.767
THE WARRANT FOR SO YOU'RE NOT.

00:58:57.834 --> 00:58:58.401
YOU KNOW SURE THAT YOU HAVE TO

00:58:58.468 --> 00:58:59.802
WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE DONE AND THEN

00:58:59.869 --> 00:59:01.271
SEE IF YOU GET A SHOT TO GET IN

00:59:01.337 --> 00:59:03.406
BECAUSE AS WE KNOW THERE'S LONG

00:59:03.473 --> 00:59:04.774
WAITING LISTS AND I'M.

00:59:04.841 --> 00:59:06.376
QUITE A BIT OF AN ADVOCATE FOR

00:59:06.442 --> 00:59:08.211
MYSELF SO I WAS ALWAYS CALLING

00:59:08.278 --> 00:59:10.246
AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW

00:59:10.313 --> 00:59:11.114
HE HOW WHAT THIS YEAR'S HAVE

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:13.016
THIS READY CAN I GO AND AND

00:59:13.082 --> 00:59:14.751
EVERYBODY WAS ALWAYS HELPFUL AND

00:59:14.817 --> 00:59:15.985
AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT THAT THEY

00:59:16.052 --> 00:59:18.187
HELP BUT IT'S JUST.

00:59:18.254 --> 00:59:19.555
RESOURCES THAT WAS A I KNOW THAT

00:59:19.622 --> 00:59:20.990
THEY WANTED TO HELP BUT THERE

00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:22.425
WAS NOBODY ELSE THERE'S NOTHING

00:59:22.492 --> 00:59:24.127
ELSE THAT THEY COULD DO.

00:59:24.193 --> 00:59:25.728
SO -- AT ONE

00:59:25.795 --> 00:59:26.796
POINT IT TOOK LIKE FIVE MONTHS

00:59:26.863 --> 00:59:28.498
OF YOUR ME TO START MY

00:59:28.564 --> 00:59:29.799
EMPLOYMENT --

00:59:29.866 --> 00:59:31.734
ARE I MEAN TO GET THE CHILD CARE

00:59:31.801 --> 00:59:33.836
SO WITHIN THAT TIME ALL OF MY

00:59:33.903 --> 00:59:35.772
INCOME BASICALLY WENT TO THE

00:59:35.838 --> 00:59:36.839
CHILD CARE I COULDN'T PAY FOR

00:59:36.906 --> 00:59:39.409
RENT THAT WAS OUT OF THE PICTURE

00:59:39.475 --> 00:59:41.210
BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF THAT I PAY

00:59:41.277 --> 00:59:42.578
FOR RENT IS THE AMOUNT THAT I

00:59:42.645 --> 00:59:43.780
WOULD PAY FOR CHILDCARE.

00:59:43.846 --> 00:59:45.815
SERVICE EITHER OR SO THEN ONCE I

00:59:45.882 --> 00:59:47.450
WAS FINALLY ABLE TO GET ON THE

00:59:47.517 --> 00:59:48.985
PROGRAM I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO

00:59:49.052 --> 00:59:50.520
MOVE OUT AND YOU KNOW BE AN

00:59:50.586 --> 00:59:51.821
ADULT BECAUSE I ACTUALLY HAD

00:59:51.888 --> 00:59:53.756
MONEY LEFT OVER AFTER TWO LITTLE

00:59:53.823 --> 00:59:55.224
ONES -- SO

00:59:55.291 --> 00:59:56.826
AFTER THAT I HAD TO DRIVE AN

00:59:56.893 --> 00:59:59.028
HOUR TO GET TO FOR MY COMMUTE TO

00:59:59.095 --> 01:00:00.163
GO TO WORK.

01:00:00.229 --> 01:00:01.531
SO I DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AND

01:00:01.597 --> 01:00:03.166
MOVE CLOSER TO MY WORK SO THAT

01:00:03.232 --> 01:00:04.767
MEANT ANOTHER WAITING LISTS FOR

01:00:04.834 --> 01:00:06.269
THE DIFFERENT CHILD CARE --

01:00:06.336 --> 01:00:07.637
PLACE AND THAT WAS WHERE I HAD

01:00:07.704 --> 01:00:08.938
THE DIFFICULTY WITH MY SON AND

01:00:09.005 --> 01:00:10.406
MY DAUGHTER NOT BEING ABLE TO BE

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:12.108
SEEN IN THE SAME PLACE.

01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:15.111
SO IN A DREAMER MORE REALITY.

01:00:15.178 --> 01:00:15.845
WOULD BE TO HAVE MORE

01:00:15.912 --> 01:00:17.814
UNINTERRUPTED CARE AS SOON AS WE

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.749
HAVE TO RETURN TO WORK AND THE

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:21.684
WHOLE FAMILY CAN BE SERVE NOT

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:23.820
JUST ONE CHILD AND THAT'S VERY

01:00:23.886 --> 01:00:25.488
STRESSFUL AND VERY COSTLY.

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:27.423
I KNOW SO MANY FAMILIES WHO JUST

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:29.459
NEED HELP PAYING FOR CHILDCARE

01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:30.994
AND THEY END UP HAVING TO QUIT.

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:34.564
SO IN IN REFERENCE A LITTLE AN

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:36.332
ELIGIBILITY WORKER SO IT IS

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:37.900
DIFFICULT BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:39.168
OF FAMILIES WHO COME TO MEAND

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:39.902
SAY.

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:41.471
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

01:00:41.537 --> 01:00:43.206
BUT I DO KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE I'M

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:45.308
THERE YOU KNOW I'M THERE AND AND

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:47.243
IT'S A STRUGGLE BECAUSE BECAUSE

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:48.911
YOU MAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:50.146
MEANS YOU DON'T.

01:00:50.213 --> 01:00:51.748
YOU MAKE TOO MUCH TO GET

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:53.349
ASSISTANCE WHEN IT'S STILL

01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:54.851
YOU'RE STILL IN THAT MIDDLE PART.

01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:56.085
SO I'M NOT I KNOW A LOT OF

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:58.321
PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO STOP AND

01:00:58.388 --> 01:00:59.322
THIS IS EVERY DAY IN MY

01:00:59.389 --> 01:01:00.823
EMPLOYMENT I SEE FAMILIES THAT

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:02.792
HAVE TO STOP BECAUSE THERE'S NO

01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:04.894
OTHER WAY. FOR THEM TO GET THE

01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:07.463
ASSISTANCE INSTEAD OF THEY HAVE

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:08.998
TO MANDATORY GO THROUGH CAL

01:01:09.065 --> 01:01:10.600
WORKS THAT'S THEIR ONLY WAY OUT.

RECOMMENDATIONS IN EACH OF THE

01:08:00.009 --> 01:08:02.978
NINE AREAS.

01:08:03.045 --> 01:08:04.780
A GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY --

01:08:04.847 --> 01:08:06.549
I AM VERY PLACES THE STATE

01:08:06.615 --> 01:08:08.451
ORGANIZER PREPARE VOICES OF BEEN

01:08:08.517 --> 01:08:10.553
A COMMUNITY COMMISSIONER AND I'M

01:08:10.619 --> 01:08:12.655
GOING TO DISCUSS --

01:08:12.721 --> 01:08:15.157
SOME BRIEFLY ABOUT OUR FAMILY

01:08:15.224 --> 01:08:16.525
ENGAGEMENT AND OUR ACCESS --

01:08:16.592 --> 01:08:18.561
RECOMMENDATIONS --

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:20.563
AS YOU SON WITNESSED --

01:08:20.629 --> 01:08:24.200
AND WITH OUR REPORT --

01:08:24.266 --> 01:08:25.634
WAS COMMITTED TO FAMILY

01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:27.269
ENGAGEMENT AT EVERY LEVEL

01:08:27.336 --> 01:08:28.871
WEATHER WAS PUTTING MYSELF ON

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:31.307
THIS COMMISSION OR CREATING THE

01:08:31.373 --> 01:08:34.810
PROCESS TO ENABLE FAMILIES TO BE.

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:36.712
THE EXPERTS AND REALLY BE SEEN

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.714
AS THE EXPERTS AND THIS

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:40.950
COMMISSION AND AND THE REPORT

01:08:41.016 --> 01:08:42.418
REALLY REFLECTS THAT.

01:08:42.485 --> 01:08:44.420
ENGAGEMENT IS TWO WAYS IT'S NOT

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:46.155
JUST FROM THE PRACTITIONER TO

01:08:46.222 --> 01:08:47.590
THE FAMILY BUT IT'S ALSO.

01:08:47.656 --> 01:08:50.793
FROM THE FAMILY BACK TO US --

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:52.394
I THINK WE REALLY REFLECTED THAT

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:54.196
WHEN YOU.

01:08:54.263 --> 01:08:56.499
SEE PARENTS WHEN YOU LISTEN TO

01:08:56.565 --> 01:08:58.134
PARENTS --

01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.134
WHEN YOU HEAR WHAT THEY'RE

01:08:59.201 --> 01:09:00.536
SAYING AND THEN TURN IT INTO

01:09:00.603 --> 01:09:01.837
ACTION --

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:03.072
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE BEST

01:09:03.138 --> 01:09:05.040
RECIPE FOR REALLY IMPROVING OUR

01:09:05.107 --> 01:09:08.377
SYSTEMS AND WHILE THIS THE

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:09.678
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE PARENTS

01:09:09.745 --> 01:09:11.447
ARE SORT OF AN ADDENDUM TO THE

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:12.481
REPORT.

01:09:12.548 --> 01:09:13.716
YOU'LL ALSO SEE THAT THERE THEY

01:09:13.782 --> 01:09:15.951
ARE ALL INTEGRATED THROUGHOUT

01:09:16.018 --> 01:09:17.720
ALL OF THE THEMES IN THE REPORT

01:09:17.786 --> 01:09:19.955
AND I THINK THIS COMMISSION CAN

01:09:20.022 --> 01:09:21.457
REALLY -- BE

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:24.193
SEEN AS A MODEL FOR HOW TO DO

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:25.961
FAMILY ENGAGEMENT RIGHT I JUST

01:09:26.028 --> 01:09:27.229
REALLY APPRECIATE IT FROM THE

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:29.131
BOTTOM OF MY HEART --

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:30.799
ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IS

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:32.868
ALSO TO CREATE --

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:34.303
AND ESTABLISH A PARENT ADVISORY

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:35.738
COUNCIL --

01:09:35.804 --> 01:09:37.306
NOT FOR LIP SERVICE --

01:09:37.373 --> 01:09:41.810
NOT TO AND YOU KNOW OF LIKE REAL

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:43.812
TEETH AND MAKE SURE THAT ANY

01:09:43.879 --> 01:09:45.848
PROPOSAL THAT'S GOING TO HAVE AN

01:09:45.915 --> 01:09:47.516
IMPACT ON CHILDREN AND FAMILIES.

01:09:47.583 --> 01:09:49.151
ARE VETTED FIRST THROUGH THOSE

01:09:49.218 --> 01:09:50.853
FAMILIES SO THAT YOU ACTUALLY

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.388
CAN ADDRESS OBSTACLES AND

01:09:52.454 --> 01:09:53.656
BARRIERS ON THE FRONT AND

01:09:53.722 --> 01:09:56.492
INSTEAD OF ON THE BACK AND WHEN

01:09:56.559 --> 01:09:58.127
IT'S AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE --

01:09:58.193 --> 01:10:00.095
I THINK THAT WHAT MONEY

01:10:00.162 --> 01:10:01.564
DESCRIBED --

01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:04.500
IN HER RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND

01:10:04.567 --> 01:10:06.869
TRAUMA INFORMED CARE --

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:09.238
FAMILY ENGAGEMENT REALLY HAS.

01:10:09.305 --> 01:10:11.240
TO START AT WILL REALLY LEAD TO

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:14.543
CULTURE SHIFTS IN HOW WE TREAT --

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:15.110
FAMILIES WHO ARE COMING TO

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:16.779
SUPPORT SHE DESCRIBED THE

01:10:16.845 --> 01:10:18.314
SECURITY GUARDS --

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:20.149
WE HEARD FROM SO MANY FAMILIES

01:10:20.215 --> 01:10:23.052
JUST THIS YOU KNOW --

01:10:23.118 --> 01:10:25.788
ENVIRONMENT OF FRAUD DETECTION

01:10:25.854 --> 01:10:28.290
AND AND CRIMINALIZATION AND WE

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:30.225
NEED TO REMOVE THAT SO THAT WE

01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:32.461
CAN ALL WORK IN AS PARTNERS.

01:10:32.528 --> 01:10:35.598
IN ACHIEVING THE OUTCOMES THAT

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:36.231
WE NEED --

01:10:36.298 --> 01:10:38.567
IN REGARDS TO THE ACCESS

01:10:38.634 --> 01:10:40.569
RECOMMENDATIONS --

01:10:40.636 --> 01:10:42.471
WE WERE ABLE TO BRING IN THE

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:45.341
HAAS INSTITUTE FROM UC BERKELEY --

01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:46.342
STEVEN --

01:10:46.408 --> 01:10:48.644
MEN INDIAN CAME AND SPOKE TO THE

01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:50.179
BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION HEARING

01:10:50.245 --> 01:10:52.581
AND INTRODUCED US TO A TOPIC

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:54.617
CALLED TARGETED UNIVERSALISM.

01:10:54.683 --> 01:10:55.851
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ACCESS

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:59.888
SOMETIMES UNIVERSAL ACCESS RIGHT --

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:02.358
AND THAT IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:03.859
TO HAVE UNIVERSAL ACCESS FOR

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:05.227
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES --

01:11:05.294 --> 01:11:06.795
BUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT UNIVERSAL

01:11:06.862 --> 01:11:08.397
ACCESS IS THAT THAT CAN OFTEN

01:11:08.464 --> 01:11:09.798
MEAN THAT THOSE WHO HAVE THE

01:11:09.865 --> 01:11:11.433
LEAST BARRIERS AND OBSTACLES ARE

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:12.568
GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE

01:11:12.635 --> 01:11:13.936
PROGRAMS FIRST.

01:11:14.003 --> 01:11:15.270
AND SO --

01:11:15.337 --> 01:11:17.139
WHAT WHAT HE TALKED TO US ABOUT

01:11:17.206 --> 01:11:18.941
WAS TARGETED UNIVERSALISM AND

01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:21.076
THAT'S HOW WE LAID OUT OUR

01:11:21.143 --> 01:11:22.811
RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND ACCESS SO

01:11:22.878 --> 01:11:23.879
YOU'LL SEE THAT WHILE THE

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:25.614
UNIVERSAL GOAL --

01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:26.782
WOULD BE THAT NO PARENT --

01:11:26.849 --> 01:11:28.183
PAYS MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:30.519
INCOME TOWARDS THE COST OF CARE --

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:32.421
IN BETWEEN WE HAVE SHORT TERM

01:11:32.488 --> 01:11:34.156
MID TERM --

01:11:34.223 --> 01:11:36.558
GOALS -- ONE

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:37.626
WOULD BE.

01:11:37.693 --> 01:11:39.828
SERVING FAMILIES WHO MAKE UNDER

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:41.063
1100% OF THE SEPT SUPPLEMENTAL

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.831
POVERTY MEASURE WHICH DEFINITELY

01:11:42.898 --> 01:11:44.800
TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE COST OF

01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:46.468
LIVING IN CALIFORNIA --

01:11:46.535 --> 01:11:48.237
THE NEXT GOAL WOULD BE TO SERVE

01:11:48.303 --> 01:11:49.438
FAMILIES --

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:51.440
BELOW 70% OF THE STATE MEDIAN

01:11:51.507 --> 01:11:52.941
INCOME --

01:11:53.008 --> 01:11:55.077
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE AN IDEA

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:57.346
AROUND --

01:11:57.413 --> 01:11:59.314
ESTABLISHING A ALTERNATIVE

01:11:59.381 --> 01:12:00.849
PAYMENT PROGRAM EMERGENCY

01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:02.918
SERVICES FUND AND THIS IS A

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:04.219
RECOGNITION THAT.

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:18.901
CHILDREN --

01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:20.869
ON WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CHILD

01:12:20.936 --> 01:12:22.938
CARE SERVICES 86% OF THEM ARE

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:25.040
CHILDREN OF COLOR --

01:12:25.107 --> 01:12:27.476
AND A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THEM

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:29.211
ARE WAITING FOR CHILDCARE BUT

01:12:29.278 --> 01:12:31.413
OUR EXPERIENCE SEEN CRISIS RIGHT

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.449

EXACERBATING THAT TRAUMA.

01:12:46.495 --> 01:12:47.930
AND SO BY PULLING OFF THOSE

01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:49.765
FAMILIES AND HAVING AN EMERGENCY

01:12:49.832 --> 01:12:52.735

THIS AMAZING WORK WE'RE NOT

01:14:44.012 --> 01:14:45.013
GOING TO GET VERY FAR.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.248
WE NEED TO CONSIDER MORE WORK

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:48.350
FORCES ARE KERN WORK FORCES

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:50.485
UNDERPAID OVERWORKED AND IN MANY

01:14:50.552 --> 01:14:52.287
CASES NOT SUPPORTED.

01:14:52.354 --> 01:14:53.722
BY ANY SYSTEM.

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:55.891
WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A MAKES

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:57.793
DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT IN SOME

01:14:57.860 --> 01:14:59.862
CASES WE DO HAVE THE SUPPORT

01:14:59.928 --> 01:15:02.164
MECHANISMS BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T

01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:03.365
TO BE PART.

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:05.267
OF A BIG SYSTEM THEY'RE IN A

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:07.269
CENTER BASED PROGRAM WHEN

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:09.004
THEY'RE PART OF A NONPROFIT.

01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:10.873
BUT WITHIN A SYSTEM THAT'S IN

01:15:10.939 --> 01:15:13.675
THE CENTER AND DO HAVE RESOURCES.

01:15:13.742 --> 01:15:15.611
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT

01:15:15.677 --> 01:15:17.079
ARE THE FAMILY FRIENDS AND

01:15:17.145 --> 01:15:19.414
NEIGHBORS WHO ARE CARING.

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:21.450
FOR A HUGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR

01:15:21.516 --> 01:15:22.985
CHILDREN.

01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:25.287
WHAT ABOUT THE FAMILY CHILD CARE

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:27.856
PROVIDERS THAT MIGHT BE PART OF

01:15:27.923 --> 01:15:30.425
A FAMILY CHILD CARE NETWORK BUT

01:15:30.492 --> 01:15:31.927
MIGHT NOT HAVE?

01:15:31.994 --> 01:15:35.564
AS MANY SUPPORT IN ONE AREA

01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:37.499
VERSUS ANOTHER VERSUS COACHELLA

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:40.035
AS OPPOSED TO FRESNO AS OPPOSED

01:15:40.102 --> 01:15:41.970
TO LA AS OPPOSED TO LAKE COUNTY

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:42.938
AT CETERA.

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:45.774
WHAT ABOUT THE WORK FORCE THAT

01:15:45.841 --> 01:15:48.543

THE DEAL WITH.

01:16:01.156 --> 01:16:02.291
LEARNING ISSUES.

01:16:02.357 --> 01:16:04.159
SO OUR WORK FORCE IS NOT ONLY

01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:06.828
DIVERSE IN TERMS OF WHO WE ARE.

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:08.096

WITHIN --

01:16:13.702 --> 01:16:15.704
OUR EXISTING SYSTEM WE NEED TO

BUT THAT THEY MAY NEED

URBAN AREA.

01:16:55.077 --> 01:16:57.212
WE NEED TO CONSIDER THAT OUR

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:58.580
EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:16:58.647 --> 01:17:00.716
IS AN ASSET WHICH WE NEED TO

01:17:00.782 --> 01:17:01.616
BUILD UP.

01:17:01.683 --> 01:17:03.585
WE HAVE A MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM

01:17:03.652 --> 01:17:05.854

CENTER BASED HOME BASED AND THAT

01:17:10.425 --> 01:17:12.494
IT NEEDS TO BE REALLY MADE MORE

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:13.729
ABUNDANT.

01:17:13.795 --> 01:17:15.797
WE NEED TO CONSIDER THE CAREER

AND THE CHOICES THAT INDIVIDUAL

01:18:11.019 --> 01:18:12.220
CAN COME ABOUT.

01:18:12.287 --> 01:18:13.755
AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE

01:18:31.339 --> 01:18:34.643
THAT WE MAINTAIN AND SUSTAIN A

01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:36.845
HIGH CALL QUALITY WORK FORCE FOR

01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:37.813

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:39.548
TODDLERS ARE PRESCHOOLS AND

01:18:39.614 --> 01:18:41.516
BEYOND BECAUSE MANY OF OUR

01:18:41.583 --> 01:18:47.089
CHILDREN DO NEED THAT I'M GOING.

01:18:47.155 --> 01:18:48.990
CARE PART UNTIL THEY'RE TWELVE

01:18:49.057 --> 01:18:50.959
YEARS OLD AND SO I KNOW THAT

01:18:51.026 --> 01:18:51.593
MANY OF THE AUDIENCE THAT OUR

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:54.196
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS ARE.

01:18:54.262 --> 01:18:57.966
ARE ALWAYS ADVOCATING FOR FOR

01:18:58.033 --> 01:18:58.934
OUR CHILDREN AND OUR FAMILIES IN

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.735
CALIFORNIA.

01:19:00.802 --> 01:19:02.704
SO THE REPORT HAS A LOT MORE.

01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:07.375
AND NOW THEY IN A FINANCED IT SO

01:19:07.442 --> 01:19:09.478
WILL TRANSFER OVER.

01:19:09.544 --> 01:19:10.045
TO TANYA DID YOU WANT TO ADD

01:19:10.112 --> 01:19:11.413
ANYTHING.

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:12.914
YEAH SO AND JUST ONE MORE THING --

01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:14.116
THAT SOON I HAD TALKED ABOUT

01:19:14.182 --> 01:19:16.218
THIS MORNING AND IT WAS THE FACT

01:19:16.284 --> 01:19:18.253
THAT THERE'S SO MANY ENTITIES

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.554
OUT THERE.

01:19:19.621 --> 01:19:22.524
THAT ARE AVAILABLE BUT WE NEVER

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:23.892
COME TOGETHER.

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:26.561
AND BECAUSE OF THAT THIS WHOLE

01:19:26.628 --> 01:19:28.130
CHILD CARE SYSTEM IS IS.

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:30.198
IS DISJOINTED.

01:19:30.265 --> 01:19:32.567
AND SO UNTIL WE RECOGNIZED AND

01:19:32.634 --> 01:19:34.536
FIGURE OUT HOW TO COLLABORATE

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:39.441
AND COME TOGETHER AT THE TABLE --

01:19:39.508 --> 01:19:40.976
WE'LL STAY DISJOINTED AND WHICH

01:19:41.042 --> 01:19:42.844
MEANS THE WORK FORCE WILL NOT

01:19:42.911 --> 01:19:44.246
HAVE ROOM TO GROW.

01:19:44.312 --> 01:19:46.414
AND ALL THE THINGS THAT SHE JUST

01:19:46.481 --> 01:19:48.250
LAID OUT THAT WE HAVE THAT WE

01:19:48.316 --> 01:19:50.051
HAVE DISCUSSED WE FELT LIKE THAT

01:19:50.118 --> 01:19:51.987
WILL THAT WILL HAPPEN AND THAT

01:19:52.053 --> 01:19:53.355
WILL TAKE PLACE.

01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:56.391
AND WE FEEL LIKE WE ARE A MODEL

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:58.393
OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

01:19:58.460 --> 01:19:59.227
WHEN GROUPS FROM EVERY

01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:02.030
ORGANIZATION COMES TOGETHER AND

01:20:02.097 --> 01:20:04.533
CAN COME UP WITH SOME SOLUTIONS

01:20:04.599 --> 01:20:06.902
AND SO --

01:20:06.968 --> 01:20:07.469
JUST ADDING THAT LIKE I SAID

01:20:07.536 --> 01:20:11.740
WHERE THE OUR FIRST FIVE OR YOUR

01:20:11.806 --> 01:20:13.708

ALL NEED TO LEARN HOW TO COME IN

01:20:15.177 --> 01:20:16.711
AND WORK TOGETHER AND THAT IS

01:20:16.778 --> 01:20:18.413
WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE WORK

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:27.122
FORCE EVEN STRONGER [inaudible]

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:32.827

PUSH THE BLAME IS COMMISSIONER

01:20:33.495 --> 01:20:35.030
MAHDI --

01:20:35.096 --> 01:20:37.232
CARING FOR CHILDREN I THINK WE

01:20:37.299 --> 01:20:40.268

CARING FOR STUDENTS AND CHILDREN

01:20:49.945 --> 01:20:50.579
DO NOT.

01:20:50.645 --> 01:20:52.280
IT DOESN'T START ONCE YOU ENTER

01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:53.315
KINDERGARTEN.

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:55.116
IT STARTS THE MINUTE A CHILD IS

01:20:55.183 --> 01:20:56.384
BORN.

01:20:56.451 --> 01:20:58.153
CHILDREN WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS

01:20:58.220 --> 01:20:59.888
TO QUALITY CARE BEFORE THEY

01:20:59.955 --> 01:21:01.856
ENTER KINDERGARTEN.

01:21:01.923 --> 01:21:04.226
ARE AT A TREMENDOUS DISADVANTAGE

01:21:04.292 --> 01:21:06.795
AND WILL HAVE TO WORK MANY TIMES

01:21:06.861 --> 01:21:08.964
HARDER TO CATCH UP.

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:10.632
IMPROVING IN INCREASING SERVICES

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:13.068

FAMILIES ARE A MUST.

01:21:14.903 --> 01:21:16.571
AND THE SERVICES THAT WE ALREADY

01:21:16.638 --> 01:21:18.440
HAVE IN PLACE MUST BE EASIER TO

01:21:18.506 --> 01:21:19.474
ACCESS.

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:22.077
SYSTEMS MUST BE SIMPLIFIED AND

01:21:22.143 --> 01:21:23.411
THE ALIGNMENT IN COORDINATION

01:21:23.478 --> 01:21:25.914
BETWEEN VARIOUS AGENCIES AND

01:21:25.981 --> 01:21:27.349
PROGRAMS CARING FOR CHILDREN

01:21:27.415 --> 01:21:30.218
MUST IMPROVE IF WE ARE TO CLOSE

01:21:30.285 --> 01:21:31.987
THE OPPORTUNITY AND ACCESS GAP

01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:34.456
SO PREVALENT ACROSS OUR NEW

01:21:34.522 --> 01:21:37.058

WE THOUGHT THAT.

01:25:33.528 --> 01:25:35.096
IT MADE SENSE TO END.

ON OKAY SO.

01:25:38.867 --> 01:25:39.901

01:26:05.727 --> 01:26:07.161
WE START BY TALKING ABOUT THAT

01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:09.697
EVERYTHING THAT WE DO WE HAVE TO

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:10.965
APPLY EQUITY LENDS TO IT.

01:26:11.032 --> 01:26:12.333
THAT MEANS THAT THE PLANNING THE

THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN PLAN

01:27:35.116 --> 01:27:37.218
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW PROVIDERS

01:27:37.285 --> 01:27:38.486
DON'T HAVE.

01:27:38.553 --> 01:27:39.821
DISASTER RECOVERY PLANS AND

01:27:39.887 --> 01:27:41.222
REALLY NEED ONE ESPECIALLY IN

THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISASTER

01:27:44.759 --> 01:27:46.160
EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS.

01:27:46.227 --> 01:27:47.161
WHERE --

01:27:47.228 --> 01:27:48.863

AND FOR BENEFITS PACKAGES --

01:27:58.906 --> 01:27:59.907
WE NEED TO DEVELOP NEW

01:27:59.974 --> 01:28:01.542

AND THEN IN TERMS OF FINANCING.

01:28:42.083 --> 01:28:43.651
THERE SHOULD BE EQUITABLE ACCESS

01:28:43.718 --> 01:28:45.119

CHILD CARE WORKERS AND PROVIDER

SHOULD NOT FINANCE THROUGH THEIR

01:29:16.217 --> 01:29:17.952
LOW WAGES AND THEIR LACK OF

01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:19.087
BENEFITS THE FEEL THAT THEY

01:29:19.153 --> 01:29:21.689
SHOULD BE COMPENSATED THE WAY

01:29:21.756 --> 01:29:22.824
THAT EVERYBODY ELSE'S COMPENSATE.

01:29:22.890 --> 01:29:24.425
WE'RE ALSO RECOMMENDING THAT IN

01:29:24.492 --> 01:29:26.127
ORDER TO GET TO A 100% OF

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:29.063
FUNDING FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE

TAXABLE WAGES OF A HUNDRED AND

01:29:32.667 --> 01:29:34.168
FOURTEEN THOUSAND AND SIXTY

01:29:34.235 --> 01:29:35.636
SEVEN SO THAT.

01:29:35.703 --> 01:29:37.438
EVERYBODY PAYS TOWARDS MAKING

01:29:37.505 --> 01:29:39.674
SURE THAT THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN

01:29:39.741 --> 01:29:42.143
HAVE THEIR PARENTS. FOR THOSE IN

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:45.646
CRITICAL BONDING TIMES THEN.

01:29:45.713 --> 01:29:46.814
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAXIMIZING

01:29:46.881 --> 01:29:48.516
FEDERAL DRAWDOWNS WE'RE TALKING

01:29:48.583 --> 01:29:50.651
ABOUT ENSURING THAT ALL MENTAL

01:29:50.718 --> 01:29:52.520
HEALTH SERVICES ACT MONEY GOES

01:29:56.357 --> 01:29:57.658
IN SO.

01:29:57.725 --> 01:29:58.359
THERE'S A LOT MORE

01:29:58.426 --> 01:29:59.660
RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I THOUGHT I

01:29:59.727 --> 01:30:01.162
WOULD JUST PULL OUT THOSE IS IS

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:02.597
BEING SOME THAT THAT I THOUGHT

01:30:02.663 --> 01:30:04.499
TO BE PARTICULARLY USEFUL.

01:30:04.565 --> 01:30:07.135
AND THEN OVERVIEW FOR CLEAN UP

01:30:07.201 --> 01:30:08.803

HELP BUT WE REALLY WANT TO GET

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:16.944
TO YOU -- SO

01:30:17.011 --> 01:30:18.012
IN TERMS OF THE DATA THE

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:20.047
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE EARLY

01:30:20.114 --> 01:30:22.617
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SYSTEM IN

01:30:22.683 --> 01:30:25.186
CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF DATA.

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:26.721
IS [inaudible]

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:28.990
NOT EVEN BEGINNING TO BE

01:30:29.056 --> 01:30:30.658
ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT THIS

01:30:30.725 --> 01:30:33.094
COMPLICATED SYSTEM IT'S NOT THAT

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:34.595
WE DON'T COLLECT A LOT OF DATA

01:30:34.662 --> 01:30:36.330
WE COLLECT A LOT OF DATA AS

01:30:36.397 --> 01:30:38.332
ANYBODY WHO'S A PROVIDER KNOWS

01:30:38.399 --> 01:30:39.834
AND IS ANYBODY WHO'S A PARENT

01:30:39.901 --> 01:30:40.401
KNOWS.

01:30:40.468 --> 01:30:42.069
THERE'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

01:30:42.136 --> 01:30:44.505
FORM FILLING OUT AND FORM RE

01:30:44.572 --> 01:30:47.742
COMPLETION AND RE AND CETERA

01:30:47.809 --> 01:30:48.843
IT'S NOT ALL DATA THAT'S

01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:51.212
ACTUALLY USED. FOR ON GOING

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:53.114
IMPROVEMENT OF THE SYSTEM IT'S

01:30:53.181 --> 01:30:54.849
BEEN AS AS THAT NUMBER VESTED

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:56.717
SAID SEVERAL TIMES COMPLIANCE

01:30:56.784 --> 01:31:00.221
ORIENTED NOT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT

01:31:00.288 --> 01:31:00.888
ORIENTED.

01:31:00.955 --> 01:31:06.794
AND WE ALL NEED TO BAND TOGETHER.

01:31:06.861 --> 01:31:08.696
DATA CAN BE REALLY IT HELPFUL

01:31:08.763 --> 01:31:10.231
THE DATA THAT'S COLLECTED

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:12.166
DIRECTLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FROM

01:31:12.233 --> 01:31:14.202
PROGRAMS BUT ALSO COORDINATING

01:31:14.268 --> 01:31:16.337
THAT DATA WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO

01:31:16.404 --> 01:31:18.206
ARE COLLECTING DATA SO WHERE.

01:31:18.272 --> 01:31:19.874
FOR JUST FOR EXAMPLE PROJECTING

01:31:19.941 --> 01:31:21.475
OUR CHILD POPULATION SO WE

01:31:21.542 --> 01:31:22.777
UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE PLANNING

01:31:22.844 --> 01:31:24.278
FOR INTO THE FUTURE THERE ARE A

01:31:24.345 --> 01:31:26.247
LOT OF PIECES OF DATA THAT WE

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:28.649
JUST HAVEN'T COORDINATED HERE --

01:31:28.716 --> 01:31:31.219
THE THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE

01:31:31.285 --> 01:31:33.955
SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:35.590
TRANSPARENT TO THOSE OF US WHO

01:31:35.656 --> 01:31:37.525
WORK IN IT BUT EVEN MORE

01:31:37.592 --> 01:31:39.026
IMPORTANT TRANSPARENT TO PARENTS

01:31:39.093 --> 01:31:41.062
AND FAMILIES WHO ARE LOOKING FOR

01:31:41.128 --> 01:31:42.897
CARE AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

01:31:42.964 --> 01:31:45.032
WHAT'S AVAILABLE IN THEIR AREA.

01:31:45.099 --> 01:31:46.734
AND TRANSPARENT TO THE PUBLIC

01:31:46.801 --> 01:31:47.401
THIS IS.

01:31:47.468 --> 01:31:49.270
I WORK A LOT OF CHILD AND FAMILY

01:31:49.337 --> 01:31:51.739
SERVICES SYSTEMS AND THIS IS ONE

01:31:51.806 --> 01:31:54.609
OF THE MOST COMPLICATED. TO TRY

01:31:54.675 --> 01:31:56.344
TO UNDERSTAND --

01:31:56.410 --> 01:31:58.179
THE INTEGRATION OF DATA IS ALSO

01:31:58.246 --> 01:32:00.281
REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

01:32:00.348 --> 01:32:04.118
FAMILIES NEED A LOT OF HELP AND

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:05.286
SUPPORT ALONG THE WAY AT

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:06.787
DIFFERENT POINTS IN TIME SO

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:08.923
MAKING SURE WE COULD SHARE DATA.

01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:10.825
THAT REALLY SUPPORTS THOSE NEEDS

01:32:10.892 --> 01:32:12.260
SO WHERE FINANCING THEM

01:32:12.326 --> 01:32:14.829
APPROPRIATELY IS INCREDIBLY

01:32:14.896 --> 01:32:15.463
IMPORTANT.

01:32:15.529 --> 01:32:16.764
CAN AND THE LAST THING I JUST

01:32:16.831 --> 01:32:18.065
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ALL THE WE

01:32:18.132 --> 01:32:20.368
REFERRED TO IT IS THAT ONE OF

01:32:20.434 --> 01:32:21.602
THE REASONS WHY IT'S SUCH A

01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:23.170
COMPLICATED SYSTEM.

01:32:23.237 --> 01:32:30.444
IS THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD A CORD

01:32:30.511 --> 01:32:32.546
LEVEL AND SO ONE OF OUR MOST

01:32:32.613 --> 01:32:34.382
IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS HAS TO

01:32:34.448 --> 01:32:36.050
DO WITH --

01:32:36.117 --> 01:32:37.818
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EARLY

01:32:37.885 --> 01:32:40.154
CHILDHOOD POLICY COUNCIL THAT

01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:42.189
WOULD PULL TOGETHER THE PLAYERS

01:32:42.256 --> 01:32:43.391
FOR MULTIPLE PARTS OF THIS

01:32:43.457 --> 01:32:45.893
SYSTEM TO ADVISE THE GOVERNOR OF

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:48.663
THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

01:32:48.729 --> 01:32:50.464
SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC --

01:32:50.531 --> 01:32:52.700
SO WE CAN HAVE AT LEAST ONE

01:32:52.767 --> 01:32:54.502
PLACE WHICH IS REALLY THINKING

01:32:54.568 --> 01:32:56.604
ABOUT OVERSIGHT WHICH IS REALLY

01:32:56.671 --> 01:32:58.506
THINKING ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY

01:32:58.572 --> 01:32:59.507
WHICH IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT

01:32:59.573 --> 01:33:01.575
QUALITY IMPROVEMENT IN WHICH IS

01:33:01.642 --> 01:33:02.276
REALLY THINKING ABOUT.

01:33:02.343 --> 01:33:04.645
HOW DO WE MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES

01:33:04.712 --> 01:33:07.048
THAT ARE AVAILABLE --

01:33:07.114 --> 01:33:09.116
THERE ARE TWO KEY SETS OF

01:33:09.183 --> 01:33:11.052
PLAYERS HIS VOICE IS HAVE TO BE

01:33:11.118 --> 01:33:12.687
FRONT AND CENTER ON THEM.

01:33:12.753 --> 01:33:14.622
THE PARENTS THROUGH A PARENT

01:33:14.689 --> 01:33:17.124
ADVISORY COUNCIL AND THE WORK

01:33:17.191 --> 01:33:18.492
FORCE TO A WORKFORCE BUT AS YOU

01:33:18.559 --> 01:33:20.127
CANCEL AND RATHER THAN SAYING

01:33:20.194 --> 01:33:20.962
LET'S POINT ONE PARENT OR TWO

01:33:21.028 --> 01:33:22.997
PARENTS LET'S POINT ONE PROVIDER

01:33:23.064 --> 01:33:24.098
TO PROVIDERS.

01:33:24.165 --> 01:33:25.833
WE REALLY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:27.935
THAT EACH GROUP HAVE ITS OWN

01:33:28.002 --> 01:33:28.703
COUNCIL.

01:33:28.769 --> 01:33:31.138
WITH SUPPORT AND WITH THREE

01:33:31.205 --> 01:33:32.440
SOURCES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:33:32.506 --> 01:33:35.242
PARTICIPATING SO THAT THEY THEY

01:33:35.309 --> 01:33:36.510
GET THE CHANCE TO WORK THROUGH

01:33:36.577 --> 01:33:38.379
IDEAS AND AND BRING THEM FORWARD

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:39.246
TO THIS.

01:33:39.313 --> 01:33:42.249
OVERALL POLICY COUNCIL THE THE

01:33:42.316 --> 01:33:44.852
LEADERSHIP OBVIOUSLY TO FROM THE

01:33:44.919 --> 01:33:46.187
LEGISLATURE FROM THE GOVERNOR

01:33:46.253 --> 01:33:49.090
FROM KEY ORGANIZATIONS --

01:33:49.156 --> 01:33:51.392
FIRST FIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:53.294
MAKES DELIVERY SYSTEM ALL OF

01:33:53.361 --> 01:33:54.929
THAT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BUT

01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:57.098
ADMINISTRATION IS ACTUALLY

01:33:57.164 --> 01:33:57.999
REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:33:58.065 --> 01:33:59.200
TO AND SO WE'RE ALSO

01:33:59.266 --> 01:34:00.334
RECOMMENDING THAT WE ESTABLISH

01:34:00.401 --> 01:34:03.037
AN OFFICE FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD

01:34:03.104 --> 01:34:05.172
EDUCATION WHICH INCLUDES A

01:34:05.239 --> 01:34:08.943
REALLY STRONG INTER AGENCY WORK

01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:09.377
GROUP.

01:34:09.443 --> 01:34:11.112
THAT THE ABILITY OF STATE

01:34:11.178 --> 01:34:13.481
DEPARTMENTS TO WORK TOGETHER IS

01:34:13.547 --> 01:34:15.549
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BUT SO IS

01:34:15.616 --> 01:34:17.018
THE ABILITY OF THE STATE

01:34:17.084 --> 01:34:18.252
DEPARTMENT'S TO WORK WITH

01:34:18.319 --> 01:34:20.421
OUTSIDE EXTERNAL ENTITIES.

01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:29.697
WHO CAN PROVIDE RESOURCES THE

01:34:29.764 --> 01:34:32.299
STAFF AND WE WON'T GET IT DONE --

01:34:32.366 --> 01:34:33.701
AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS WORKED AT

01:34:33.768 --> 01:34:35.136
THE LOCAL LEVEL LITTLE TINY

01:34:35.202 --> 01:34:36.837
LOCALITY NAMED LOS ANGELES

01:34:36.904 --> 01:34:38.906
KILLING FOR A LAST TWENTY YEARS

01:34:38.973 --> 01:34:41.442
ON THIS WE'RE TRYING REALLY HARD

01:34:41.509 --> 01:34:42.810
AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND THEY

01:34:42.877 --> 01:34:44.378
KNOW PEOPLE ARE AND OTHER

01:34:44.445 --> 01:34:45.513
REGIONS AND COMMUNITIES

01:34:45.579 --> 01:34:47.014
THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

01:34:47.081 --> 01:34:49.016
BUT WITHOUT CLARITY FROM THE

01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:51.652
STATE LEVEL IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

01:34:51.719 --> 01:34:54.488
FOR US TO GET IT DONE AND SO

01:34:54.555 --> 01:34:55.990
