OBVIOUSLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS

00:51:47.404 --> 00:51:50.106
THE ABILITY TO CALL CREATE

00:51:50.173 --> 00:51:53.076

THREE COUNTY THIS THEIR OWN.

00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:29.973
BUT YOU'VE GOT FIFTY EIGHT

COUNTY. SO YOU HAVE FIFTY EIGHT

00:53:32.142 --> 00:53:33.877
DIFFERENT SECURE TREATMENT

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:38.381
FACILITY IS THAT CORRECT. THIS

00:53:38.448 --> 00:53:39.783
IS ALLISON HERE DEPARTMENT OF

00:53:39.849 --> 00:53:42.152

EIGHT COUNTIES I'M AND THERE IS

00:53:43.753 --> 00:53:46.590
A- MORE LICENSING REQUIREMENT

00:53:46.656 --> 00:53:47.357
THAT COUNTIES WOULD HAVE TO

00:53:47.424 --> 00:53:48.592
HAVE SOME STRUCTURE IN PLACE

00:53:48.658 --> 00:53:53.597
HOWEVER SB. NINETY TO PROVIDE

00:53:53.663 --> 00:53:54.331
SOME FLEXIBILITY IN OF COUNTY

00:53:54.397 --> 00:53:56.633
HEALTH MY MEET THAT WERE. I'M

00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:57.701
AND THAT INCLUDES CON THE WITH

00:53:57.767 --> 00:53:59.302
OTHER- IF THEY WANTED TO SOME

00:53:59.369 --> 00:54:01.071
TYPE OF REGIONAL APPROACH.

00:54:01.137 --> 00:54:02.439
AMBASSADOR ARE AT THEIR

00:54:02.505 --> 00:54:03.473
RESPONSIBILITY IN THERE ARE

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:04.741
OPTIONS IN TERMS OF HOW

00:54:04.808 --> 00:54:05.609
COUNTIES WOULD MEET THAT

00:54:05.675 --> 00:54:07.444
REQUIREMENT BUT RIGHT NOW THE

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:09.045
DJJ LOOK AT SOME OTHER PROGRAMS

00:54:09.112 --> 00:54:10.213
ARE AWARD WINNING PROGRAMS THEY

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.681
HAVE FOR REHABILITATION FOR

00:54:11.748 --> 00:54:13.483
THESE FOLKS. AND THAT'S COME

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:16.086
ABOUT BECAUSE DJS BEEN SUED AS

00:54:16.152 --> 00:54:17.454
HAS DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS OVER

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:20.924
THE YEARS BY THE PRISON LAW

00:54:20.991 --> 00:54:21.725
OFFICE SO. THEY'VE BEEN. A LOT

00:54:21.791 --> 00:54:24.260
OF LOS IN. THE TENS OR HUNDREDS

00:54:24.327 --> 00:54:25.729
OF MILLION DOLLARS PAID OUT TO

00:54:25.795 --> 00:54:27.964
GET THEM TO WHERE THEY ARE. SO

00:54:28.031 --> 00:54:29.065
NOW THAT IS GOING DOWN THE

00:54:29.132 --> 00:54:31.368
COUNTIES- ROUTING THE COUNTY

00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:32.769
JAILS BEING SUED ALREADY BY THE

LAWSUITS STATEWIDE FOR MEDICAL

00:54:35.872 --> 00:54:38.074
CARE AND OTHER ISSUES. SO IN MY

00:54:38.141 --> 00:54:40.010
MIND. I SEE MORE THIS COMING

00:54:40.076 --> 00:54:42.379
BECAUSE THESE- PROBATION

00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:43.713
DEPARTMENTS REALLY WERE BILL

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:45.048
FOR THIS. AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA

00:54:45.115 --> 00:54:47.183
HAVE IN ESSENCE YOU HAVE GROWN

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:49.085
MEN. TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD MAN

00:54:49.152 --> 00:54:49.853
IN THE FACILITIES WALKING

00:54:49.919 --> 00:54:52.222
AROUND. WITH THAT YOU KNOW YOU

00:54:52.288 --> 00:54:52.956
LOOK AT THE AGE AND WHAT WE'RE

00:54:53.023 --> 00:54:55.659
SEEING NOW- AND IN THE

00:54:55.725 --> 00:54:56.893
POPULATION A DJ WITH A HUNDRED

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.828
FIFTY. WAS DOWN TWO HUNDRED

00:54:58.895 --> 00:55:00.096
FIFTY SO WHEN IT SAYS IT'S

00:55:00.163 --> 00:55:01.531
GONNA BE EQUAL I DON'T SEE IT

00:55:01.598 --> 00:55:02.666
BEING EQUAL MONTHLY COUNTIES

00:55:02.732 --> 00:55:04.234
AND YEAH. SOME COUNTY MAKE

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:06.069
CONTACT WITH OTHER COUNTY BUT-

00:55:06.136 --> 00:55:07.704
THE END OF THE DAY. IT'S GONNA

00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:09.673
BE DONE DIFFERENT WAYS SO I

00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:11.975
GUESS. WHAT MY QUESTION IS DJJ

00:55:12.042 --> 00:55:13.943
HAS MASTERED THIS OVERTIME.

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:17.614
THROUGH TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS.

00:55:17.681 --> 00:55:18.214
THE COUNTIES ARE GONNA HIT THE

00:55:18.281 --> 00:55:19.549
GROUND RUNNING DAY ONE IN THE

00:55:19.616 --> 00:55:22.118
NEXT TWO YEARS. SO I SEE MORE

00:55:22.185 --> 00:55:23.086
OF THIS AND IF ANYTHING I SEE

00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:25.221
REGRESSION. SO HOW DO YOU HOW

00:55:25.288 --> 00:55:27.557
DO YOU COUNTER THAT THERE'S- WE

00:55:27.624 --> 00:55:30.460
WILL BE TAKING TWO STEPS BACK.

00:55:30.527 --> 00:55:30.994
IN PURSUING THIS IN GOING

00:55:31.061 --> 00:55:33.797
FORWARD WITH THIS. THANK YOU

00:55:33.863 --> 00:55:36.332
FOR THE QUESTION. I GUESS IT

00:55:36.399 --> 00:55:38.134
WOULD SAVE YOU A PART OF THIS

00:55:38.201 --> 00:55:39.402
IS THAT THE THIS DECISION ON

00:55:39.469 --> 00:55:41.304
THE REALIGNMENT TO COUNTIES WAS

00:55:41.371 --> 00:55:44.274
DECIDED AT IT V. I. S. B. TWO

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:45.475
THREE WHICH WAS ENACTED LAST

00:55:45.542 --> 00:55:47.177
YEAR THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT

00:55:47.243 --> 00:55:49.279
OF FUNDING THAT'S ALLOCATED-

00:55:49.345 --> 00:55:51.414
THAT IS KIND OF IT. BASED ON

00:55:51.481 --> 00:55:52.382
ASSUMPTIONS OF THE YOUTH THAT

00:55:52.449 --> 00:55:54.084
WOULD ULTIMATELY BE A LOT REAL

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:55.518
LINES THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:56.920
NUMBER IS REALLY THE YOUTH THAT

00:55:56.986 --> 00:55:59.122
WOULD STILL BE ACTED JJ AT THE

00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:01.024
TIME OF THE PLANT CLOSURE AND

00:56:01.091 --> 00:56:03.159
SO. I WOULD SAY THERE'S A

00:56:03.226 --> 00:56:04.127
COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE

00:56:04.194 --> 00:56:05.128
HAPPENING COUNTIES ARE

00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:09.532
REQUIRED- AS A PART OF- I SPEAK

00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:10.500
TO THREE WHICH WAS THE AT THE

00:56:10.567 --> 00:56:11.801
BILL ENACTED LAST YEAR TO

00:56:11.868 --> 00:56:16.005
PREPARE PLANS- THAT. DISCUSS

00:56:16.072 --> 00:56:17.240
THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND

00:56:17.307 --> 00:56:18.508
FACILITIES THAT THEY AND

00:56:18.575 --> 00:56:19.576
SERVICES THAT THEY WOULD BE

00:56:19.642 --> 00:56:20.977
OFFERING RELYING TO USE THAT

00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:23.880
THAT IS- AS A PART OF THE

00:56:23.947 --> 00:56:25.381
CONDITION OF FUNDING. AND

00:56:25.448 --> 00:56:26.716
CERTAINLY THOSE PLANS WOULD

00:56:26.783 --> 00:56:27.917
PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT AND

00:56:27.984 --> 00:56:28.952
THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

00:56:29.018 --> 00:56:31.121
STAKEHOLDERS THAT SB TWO THREE

00:56:31.187 --> 00:56:32.489
SPECIFIED TO BE INVOLVED IN

00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:34.457
THAT PROCESS. AS THE GOAL AGAIN

00:56:34.524 --> 00:56:35.725
IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO

00:56:35.792 --> 00:56:37.460
HAVE ACCESS TO THE SERVICES

00:56:37.527 --> 00:56:38.595
THAT WILL ENABLE THEM TO BE

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.735
HOSPITALITY WORKERS

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:14.103
UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:16.072
ACCOMPANYING LEGISLATION THAT

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:18.374
DID NOT GET SIGNED BECAUSE IT

01:06:18.441 --> 01:06:20.042
WASN'T POLICY AGREEMENT SO

01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:22.311
SINCE THERE WAS A SIX MILLION

DOLLARS OF FUNDING BUT NOT-

01:06:24.413 --> 01:06:27.016
ADEQUATE POLICY AGREEMENT THIS

01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:27.550
THIS REFLECTS THROUGH THE

01:06:27.616 --> 01:06:30.486
POLICY AGREEMENT. ON HOW TO

01:06:30.553 --> 01:06:31.587
SPEND THE SIX MILLION THAT WAS

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:32.488
APPROPRIATE FOR THIS YEAR'S

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:35.791
BUDGET AS WELL AS THE MUD THE

01:06:35.858 --> 01:06:36.425
ADDITIONAL SIX MILLION WHICH IS

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:38.594
IN THIS BILL. OKAY BUT I'M I'M

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:39.462
STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:06:39.528 --> 01:06:41.931
MUCH OF LAST YEAR'S SIX MILLION

01:06:41.997 --> 01:06:44.734

IN THE BUDGET. BUT THERE WAS.

01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:59.515
NO POLICY DIRECTION AND SO

01:06:59.582 --> 01:07:01.183
THAT'S I THINK THAT'S REALLY

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:02.618
WHY WE'RE HAVING THIS.

WELL. THIS IS REALLY THE FIRST

01:19:11.379 --> 01:19:15.317
TIME THAT WE HAVE FOCUSED- THIS

01:19:15.383 --> 01:19:17.452
KIND OF MONEY ON PREVENTION

01:19:17.519 --> 01:19:20.922
EFFORTS- AND THE- THAT THE

BILL'S CALLED WILDFIRE AND

01:19:22.824 --> 01:19:24.659
FOREST RESILIENCY BUT WE REALLY

01:19:24.726 --> 01:19:27.195
SHOULD THINK OF THIS. AS

01:19:27.262 --> 01:19:32.434
PREDOMINATELY PREVENTION MONEY-

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:37.272
LET ME GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF- WHY

01:19:37.339 --> 01:19:40.509
THAT THE MAGNITUDE OF- OF THIS

01:19:40.575 --> 01:19:42.644
IN THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR WE

01:19:42.711 --> 01:19:44.379
HAVE ABOUT SEVENTY ONE MILLION

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:45.580
DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING SPENT

01:19:45.647 --> 01:19:47.983
ON- EFFORTS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO

01:19:48.049 --> 01:19:51.119
WHAT IS AND- S. B. EIGHTY FIVE.

01:19:51.186 --> 01:19:52.687
THIS YEAR IT'S FIVE HUNDRED AND

01:19:52.754 --> 01:19:54.156
IT'LL BE FIVE HUNDRED AND

01:19:54.222 --> 01:19:54.923
THIRTY SIX MILLION AND THAT'S

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:59.427
JUST THE EARLY ACTION PART-

01:19:59.494 --> 01:20:01.630
THAT IS ALMOST SEVEN FOLD WHAT

01:20:01.696 --> 01:20:03.098
WE SPENT IN THAT WHAT WE'RE

01:20:03.165 --> 01:20:05.400
SPENDING IN THE CURRENT YEAR-

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:06.501
THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS ALREADY

01:20:06.568 --> 01:20:08.904
PROPOSED CLOSE TO FIVE HUNDRED

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.238
MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WE WILL

01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:11.973
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:14.809
IN THE JUNE BUDGET. AND ADD TO

01:20:14.876 --> 01:20:17.445
OUR- MOLD UP MUCH IN THE WAY

01:20:17.512 --> 01:20:19.681
THAT WE HAVE- MOLDED THE EARLY

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:21.183
ACTION PLAN BUT THAT EARLY

01:20:21.249 --> 01:20:22.717
ACTION PIECES THE OTHER THING

01:20:22.784 --> 01:20:25.353
THAT MAKES THIS SO IMPORTANT-

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:28.456
WE ARE ALLOCATING MONEY TODAY.

01:20:28.523 --> 01:20:30.492
TO AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:33.128
THAT ARE AS WE SPEAK PLANNING

01:20:33.195 --> 01:20:36.298
HOW TO ROLL OUT THESE EFFORTS-

01:20:36.364 --> 01:20:39.267
IN ADVANCE AND AS FIRE SEASON

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:41.670
IS BEGINNING. OF THAT'S NEVER

01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:43.972
HAPPENED BEFORE AND IT IS

01:20:44.039 --> 01:20:46.508
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT GIVEN- A

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:48.476
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT WILDFIRE IN

01:20:48.543 --> 01:20:50.011
THE STATE- IT'S OUR IT'S BEEN

01:20:50.078 --> 01:20:52.280
DESCRIBED OVER AND OVER AGAIN-

01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:54.683
JUST HOW INTENSE. LAST YEAR'S

01:20:54.749 --> 01:20:56.484
FIRE SEASON WAS BUT LET'S NOT

01:20:56.551 --> 01:20:59.754
FORGET THAT- THE SEVERAL YEARS

01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:01.923
LEADING UP TO LAST YEAR EACH OF

01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:03.458
THOSE SEASONS WAS A RECORD

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:05.126
BREAKING SEASON IT'S BEEN WORSE

01:21:05.193 --> 01:21:08.396
AND WORSE AND WORSE. AND SO-

01:21:08.463 --> 01:21:09.264
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A MORE

01:21:09.331 --> 01:21:13.001
IMPORTANT TIME FOR US TO BEGIN

01:21:13.068 --> 01:21:14.536
DOING THIS WORK WE WILL NOT.

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:16.838
LET ME REPEAT WE WILL NOT DO

01:21:16.905 --> 01:21:19.074
ALL THE PREVENTION WORK WE NEED

01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:21.910
TO DO- WITH FIVE HUNDRED AND

01:21:21.977 --> 01:21:23.078
THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS OR

01:21:23.144 --> 01:21:24.980
WITH A BILLION DOLLARS. THIS

01:21:25.046 --> 01:21:26.848
NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT OF AS THE

01:21:26.915 --> 01:21:30.185
BEGINNING OF AN ON GOING EFFORT

01:21:30.252 --> 01:21:31.920
AND TO GIVE YOU AGAIN AN IDEA

01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:34.589
THE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE- WE

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:39.361
SPEND. IN THE LAST FISCAL YEAR

01:21:39.427 --> 01:21:41.896
WE SPENT ABOUT NINE BILLION

01:21:41.963 --> 01:21:44.933
DOLLARS. FIGHTING FIRES DURING

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.235
THAT SUPPRESSION WORK- THAT IS

01:21:47.302 --> 01:21:49.204
SO IMPORTANT WE TAKE NOTHING

01:21:49.271 --> 01:21:51.439
AWAY FROM THAT- BY DOING THE

01:21:51.506 --> 01:21:53.408
PREVENTION WORK BUT HOPEFULLY

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:54.809
BY SPENDING MONEY ON

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:56.745
PREVENTION. WE WILL BE ABLE TO

01:21:56.811 --> 01:21:59.614
MITIGATE. THE NUMBER OF FIRES

01:21:59.681 --> 01:22:01.983
THERE WERE NINETY FOUR HUNDRED

01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:04.119
LAST YEAR. AT NOT ONLY THE

01:22:04.185 --> 01:22:06.288
NUMBER OF FIRES BUT THE EXTENT-

01:22:06.354 --> 01:22:09.024
TO WHICH THEY BURN. NOT A ROUTE

01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:10.792
A RECENT FEEL STUDY SHOWED

01:22:10.859 --> 01:22:14.729
THAT- CHAPARRAL WITH- HAS

01:22:14.796 --> 01:22:16.364
RECORD LOW MOISTURE VALUES IN

01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:18.867
APRIL AND LITTLE TO NO GROUP.

01:22:18.933 --> 01:22:22.070
NO GROWTH- WHEN THEY SHOULD BE

01:22:22.137 --> 01:22:24.406
BLOOMING RIGHT NOW. CHAPARRAL

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:26.174
OR FLAMMABLE SHRUBS THERE FOUND

01:22:26.241 --> 01:22:27.609
ALL OVER THE STATE BUT THEY'RE

01:22:27.676 --> 01:22:29.344
PARTICULARLY PREVALENT IN

01:22:29.411 --> 01:22:31.513
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WITH.

01:22:31.579 --> 01:22:32.781
RECORD LOW RANGE AND RECORD

01:22:32.847 --> 01:22:36.017
HEAT IT'S EXPECTED THAT THE

01:22:36.084 --> 01:22:38.687
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WILDFIRE

01:22:38.753 --> 01:22:42.691
SEASON COULD BE SEVERE- AGAIN

01:22:42.757 --> 01:22:44.092
SOMETHING THAT'S ADDRESSED IN

01:22:44.159 --> 01:22:46.461
THIS BILL THAT IS NOVEL AND

01:22:46.528 --> 01:22:49.164
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IS THAT WE

01:22:49.230 --> 01:22:53.668
RECOGNIZE. IN THE BUDGET ACTION

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:55.970
THE DIFFERENCES IN TERRAIN AND

01:22:56.037 --> 01:22:59.107
VEGETATION AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE

01:22:59.174 --> 01:23:01.576
DONE WITH PREVENTION OF

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:03.378
SPECIFIC TO DIFFERENT REGIONS

01:23:03.445 --> 01:23:09.084
OF THE STATE. OF. M. DOUG- SO

01:23:09.150 --> 01:23:11.119
AGAIN ANOTHER REASON WHY THIS

01:23:11.186 --> 01:23:13.221
IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:16.024
STATE'S WILDFIRES SOURCES ARE

01:23:16.091 --> 01:23:20.495
AS DIVERSE AS THE STATE ITSELF.

01:23:20.562 --> 01:23:23.331
THE TO ANSWER- A LITTLE BIT

01:23:23.398 --> 01:23:26.501
FURTHER THE QUESTION FROM- OUR

01:23:26.568 --> 01:23:27.435
OUR COLLEAGUE IN THE INLAND

01:23:27.502 --> 01:23:32.107
EMPIRE- WE ARE FINDING TWELVE

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:34.609
NEW CRUISE THROUGH THE- THE E.

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:37.045
FUND THERE'S ALSO FIFTEEN

01:23:37.112 --> 01:23:38.913
MILLION DOLLARS IN THE EARLY

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:41.883
BUDGET ACTION FOR HAND CREWS.

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:43.284
PEOPLE WHO WILL GO OUT AND

01:23:43.351 --> 01:23:45.019
ACTUALLY DO THIS VEGETATION

01:23:45.086 --> 01:23:47.489
WORK WITH THEIR HANDS AND HAND

01:23:47.555 --> 01:23:53.328
TOOLS- IN A YEAR WHERE WE ARE

01:23:53.395 --> 01:23:55.296
COMING OFF OF OUR MOST DEADLY

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:57.298
FIRE SEASON FACED WITH DROUGHT

01:23:57.365 --> 01:23:58.666
LIKE CONDITIONS RECORD LOW

01:23:58.733 --> 01:24:00.435
RAINFALL RECORD HIGH

01:24:00.502 --> 01:24:02.537
TEMPERATURES PLANTS AND TREES

01:24:02.604 --> 01:24:04.539
AROUND THE STATE ARE EXTREMELY

01:24:04.606 --> 01:24:07.575
STRESSED RIGHT NOW RESULTING IN

01:24:07.642 --> 01:24:08.309
DRIER AND MORE DANGEROUS

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:10.545
CONDITIONS EARLIER THAN THE

01:24:10.612 --> 01:24:13.014
STATE HAS EVER SEEN THIS

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:13.715
FUNDING COULD NOT COME AT A

01:24:13.782 --> 01:24:15.583
MORE CRUCIAL TIME AND I HOPE

01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:16.584
THAT YOU'LL JOIN ME IN

01:24:16.651 --> 01:24:19.187

MISTER JONES SAWYER IN THE

01:24:26.428 --> 01:24:29.063
MIDST RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER

01:24:29.130 --> 01:24:32.400

SB NINETY TWO AND HOPEFULLY TO

01:24:34.202 --> 01:24:36.538
SET SOME. SOME HOPEFULLY SOME

01:24:36.604 --> 01:24:38.206
GUIDELINES AND SOME HELP NOT

01:24:38.273 --> 01:24:39.307
ONLY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION

01:24:39.374 --> 01:24:41.743
BUT FOR THIS BODY OF MANY OF US

01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:45.280
HERE. ALL WERE NOT HERE WHEN IT

01:24:45.346 --> 01:24:47.115
AB ONE OH NINE REALIGNMENT WAS

01:24:47.182 --> 01:24:49.050
VOTED IN. BUT WHEN WE GOT

01:24:49.117 --> 01:24:51.252
ELECTED WE HEARD OF ALL THE

01:24:51.319 --> 01:24:54.756
IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES THAT

01:24:54.823 --> 01:24:55.957
HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT.

01:24:56.024 --> 01:24:57.725
AND AS I SAID SINCE I'VE GOTTEN

01:24:57.792 --> 01:24:59.761
HERE. IT'S NEVER REALLY

01:24:59.828 --> 01:25:01.796
LEGISLATION THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:25:01.863 --> 01:25:03.965
THING IS IMPLEMENTATION. AND

01:25:04.032 --> 01:25:06.167
WHAT IS WHAT IS PROBLEMATIC

01:25:06.234 --> 01:25:08.503
RIGHT NOW IS WE DON'T KNOW HOW

01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:10.371
LONG THIS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED

01:25:10.438 --> 01:25:13.842
AT THE LOWER LEVELS- WHETHER

01:25:13.908 --> 01:25:16.044
IT'S THREE HUNDRED NINETY NINE

01:25:16.110 --> 01:25:17.045
GOING DOWNWARD RIGHT NOT

01:25:17.111 --> 01:25:19.514
EXISTING STRUCTURES THERE- WE

01:25:19.581 --> 01:25:22.684
NEED MORE. SPECIFICITY ON HOW

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:25.620
THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED AND I

01:25:25.687 --> 01:25:26.988
THINK WHICH YOU WHICH YOU'RE

01:25:27.055 --> 01:25:29.357
FEELING NOT ONLY FROM PROBATION

01:25:29.424 --> 01:25:30.425
BUT YOU SHOULD BE FEELING SOME

01:25:30.492 --> 01:25:32.327
THANKS FROM THE COMMUNITY

01:25:32.393 --> 01:25:35.630
GROUPS THAT. WERE SOME SOME

01:25:35.697 --> 01:25:38.433
COUNTY OFFICES ARE PLANNING TO

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:39.467
SEND THEM OUT TO HELP WITH

01:25:39.534 --> 01:25:42.303
THAT- WE NOT ONLY NEED TO KNOW

01:25:42.370 --> 01:25:44.472
WHAT WHAT THAT IS. BUT ALSO

01:25:44.539 --> 01:25:46.107
THEY HAVE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY I

01:25:46.174 --> 01:25:47.775
THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

01:25:47.842 --> 01:25:49.410
THAT A LOT OF OUR BILLS THAT WE

01:25:49.477 --> 01:25:51.746
DO AND- I LOVE WHAT WE DO UP

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:55.083
HERE. BUT WE DON'T PUT ENOUGH.

01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:57.418
RESOURCES MONEY. AND JUST

01:25:57.485 --> 01:25:59.220
REALLY LAYING OUT HOW SOMETHING

01:25:59.287 --> 01:26:02.056
WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED ONCE WE

01:26:02.123 --> 01:26:04.592
MAKE A DECISION. AND SO DID FOR

01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:06.127
EXAMPLE THE OFFICE OF USE AND

01:26:06.194 --> 01:26:07.662
COMMITTEE RESTORATION AND

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:10.498
BUDGET SUB FIVE. OF THERE WAS A

01:26:10.565 --> 01:26:13.368
LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT IT IN

01:26:13.434 --> 01:26:15.303
THE COMMITTED I SIT ON. UNDER A

01:26:15.370 --> 01:26:16.804
LOT OF MEMBERS THAT THEIR ON-

01:26:16.871 --> 01:26:18.773
BUT TO SOME FIVE THE FELT THAT

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.475
THE OFFICE MAY NOT HAVE ENOUGH

01:26:20.542 --> 01:26:22.777
RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:25.213
THIS MAMMOTH UNDERTAKING. AND

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:27.749
SO- MY SUGGESTION. AND I HELLO

01:26:27.815 --> 01:26:29.951
I'M WORKING WITH OTHERS TO TRY

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:31.619
TO COME UP WITH SOME. SOME

01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:34.255
SPECIFIC GUIDELINES ON HOW THIS

01:26:34.322 --> 01:26:36.991
WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED. WITHOUT

01:26:37.058 --> 01:26:38.359
INTERFERING TOO MUCH WITH THE

01:26:38.426 --> 01:26:40.161
LOCAL AUTHORITY BUT MAKING SURE

01:26:40.228 --> 01:26:42.130
THAT THE LOCAL AUTHORITY THEN

01:26:42.196 --> 01:26:44.032
COME BACK TO A YEAR FROM NOW.

01:26:44.098 --> 01:26:45.967
AND SAY THAT THEY DO THEY WERE

01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:47.869
UNDER RESOURCE UNDER FUNDED OR

01:26:47.936 --> 01:26:49.103
THEY DIDN'T GET ENOUGH

01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:52.106
DIRECTION. FROM THIS BODY ON

01:26:52.173 --> 01:26:55.944
HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE- THE DJJ

01:26:56.010 --> 01:26:59.280
OF REALIGNMENT AND SO- WE NEED

01:26:59.347 --> 01:27:00.882
TO GET THIS DONE AND WE NEED TO

SIX MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT

01:28:46.487 --> 01:28:47.288
THERE WAS NO AGREEMENT ON

01:28:47.355 --> 01:28:49.190
POLICY YOU'RE CONTRADICTING

01:28:49.257 --> 01:28:50.625
THAT YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT

01:28:50.692 --> 01:28:52.427
THAT MONEY WAS NOT SPECIFICALLY

01:28:52.493 --> 01:28:53.261
FOR THAT AND IF THAT'S THE

01:28:53.327 --> 01:28:55.163
CASE. THEN WHY THE RUSH ON

01:28:55.229 --> 01:28:57.465

01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:08.743
IF YOU IF THE- BUDGET COMMITTEE

01:29:18.853 --> 01:29:20.088
NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO THERE WAS

01:29:20.154 --> 01:29:22.290
A STATEMENT MADE. EARLIER THAT

01:29:22.356 --> 01:29:24.992
THIS BILL CHANGES THE LABOR

01:29:25.059 --> 01:29:28.896
CODE- AND- FOR THE QUESTION IS

01:29:28.963 --> 01:29:30.465
IF IT CHANGES THE LABOR CODE

01:29:30.531 --> 01:29:33.367

THE POINT TO THE IS THAT IF

YOU'RE HAVING TO SCRAMBLE TO

01:29:56.991 --> 01:29:58.593

OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE TO BE

01:30:02.463 --> 01:30:04.031

TO GET THESE BILLS IF OUR OWN

01:30:09.370 --> 01:30:10.438
BUDGET COMMITTEE IS NOT

PREPARED TO HAVE THOSE ANSWERS.

01:30:12.373 --> 01:30:13.407
AND AGAIN THE QUESTION ABOUT

01:30:13.474 --> 01:30:15.042
THE LABOR CODE IS BACK GOING TO

01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:18.880
EXPIRE ALSO SENSITIVE. IN

01:30:18.946 --> 01:30:19.480
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. BUT LABOR

01:30:19.547 --> 01:30:22.750
CODE CHAIN. THE PROVISIONS OF

01:30:22.817 --> 01:30:25.520

HIRE WILL EXPIRE AT THE END-

01:30:27.889 --> 01:30:29.957
AND I AM NOT SURE IF MY

01:30:30.024 --> 01:30:31.526
COLLEAGUE FROM THE I. R. IS

01:30:31.592 --> 01:30:35.129
ABLE TO RESPOND TO THAT EITHER-

01:30:35.196 --> 01:30:38.432
VIET VIA EMAIL- WHICH IS ONE

01:30:38.499 --> 01:30:39.333
WAY THAT WE CAN COMMUNICATE

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:39.934
AND- HE WAS HAVING

01:30:40.001 --> 01:30:43.004
DIFFICULTIES- BUT- THE QUESTION

01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:44.372
WAS IN REGARDS TO WHETHER THE

01:30:44.438 --> 01:30:47.275
PROVISIONS OF THE LABOR CODE

01:30:47.341 --> 01:30:47.842
WOULD EXPIRE WITH THE SUNSET

01:30:47.909 --> 01:31:00.855
DATE. AM I WAITING FOR ARE WE

01:31:00.922 --> 01:31:07.728
WAITING FOR AN ANSWER FOR THAT.

01:31:07.795 --> 01:31:09.630
YES I AM. I THINK THERE'S A

01:31:09.697 --> 01:31:11.299
COMMUNICATION INTERNET ISSUES

01:31:11.365 --> 01:31:12.934
SO I'M I'M WAITING FOR A

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.703
RESPONSE. OKAY WELL I WILL

01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:16.571
SHARE THAT WITH YOU AS SOON AS

01:31:16.637 --> 01:31:18.840
I GET IT. AND SO OKAY SO THEN

01:31:18.906 --> 01:31:20.274
I'LL FOLLOW UP AND WE'RE

01:31:20.341 --> 01:31:22.710
TALKING ABOUT THIS BILL-

01:31:22.777 --> 01:31:25.346
BECAUSE OF THE COLDA PANDEMIC

01:31:25.413 --> 01:31:27.648
WE'VE BEEN VOTING ON BILLS. ARE

01:31:27.715 --> 01:31:30.184
THE LAST MONTH- LAST YEAR THAT

01:31:30.251 --> 01:31:31.719
WERE ALL COVERT RELATED AND

01:31:31.786 --> 01:31:33.020
MOST OF THEM HAVE EXPIRATION

01:31:33.087 --> 01:31:35.389
DATES OF ADS. BY THE END OF

01:31:35.456 --> 01:31:36.691
THIS YEAR SOME OF THEM

01:31:36.757 --> 01:31:39.093
SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH SO I DON'T

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.027
UNDERSTAND WHY THIS ONE IS

01:31:40.094 --> 01:31:41.395
STILL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IN FOR

01:31:41.462 --> 01:31:44.732
USING COVERT AS AN EXCUSE- FOR

01:31:44.799 --> 01:31:46.701
THIS BY THE BILL TO BE INSERTED

01:31:46.767 --> 01:31:49.136
TODAY. IF IT'S ABOUT KOBE I

01:31:49.203 --> 01:31:51.372
WOULD EXPECT I WOULD HOPE THAT

01:31:51.439 --> 01:31:52.440
ALL OF THE OTHER BILLS THAT WE

01:31:52.506 --> 01:31:54.041
PASSED SO FAR THAT HAVE BEEN

01:31:54.108 --> 01:31:54.876
COVERED RELATED TO HAVE

01:31:54.942 --> 01:31:56.811
EXPIRATION DATES. OF AT LEAST

01:31:56.878 --> 01:31:58.279
THAT SOMETIME THIS YEAR AND

01:31:58.346 --> 01:32:00.581
THIS ONE IS NOT UNTIL TWENTY

01:32:00.648 --> 01:32:01.649
TWENTY FOUR SO GOES BACK TO THE

01:32:01.716 --> 01:32:03.551
QUESTION AGAIN ABOUT IS THIS

01:32:03.618 --> 01:32:06.187
THE PROPER- WAY TO IMPLEMENT

01:32:06.254 --> 01:32:07.922
THIS KIND OF POLICY IF THIS

01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:10.658
EXPLORATION. IS NOT TILL TWENTY

01:32:10.725 --> 01:32:11.225
TWENTY FOUR THEN I THINK WE

01:32:11.292 --> 01:32:12.426
HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO GET IT

01:32:12.493 --> 01:32:14.028
THROUGH THE REGULAR PROCESS

01:32:14.095 --> 01:32:15.696
IT'S FRUSTRATING TO ME THAT THE

01:32:15.763 --> 01:32:17.231
BILLS THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT

01:32:17.298 --> 01:32:18.633
ARE PUT INTO THE BUDGET PROCESS

01:32:18.699 --> 01:32:20.868
WITH TWO DAYS OF NOTICE TO US.

01:32:20.935 --> 01:32:22.103
WHEN WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO

01:32:22.169 --> 01:32:23.704
EITHER GET THE BUILDING CLEARLY

01:32:23.771 --> 01:32:25.139
YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME EITHER

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:25.973
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:28.376
ANSWERS RIGHT NOW- FOR US TO BE

01:32:28.442 --> 01:32:29.377
ABLE TO TALK TO THE OUR

01:32:29.443 --> 01:32:31.078
CONSTITUENTS THE ONES THAT WE

01:32:31.145 --> 01:32:32.280
HAVE TRANSFERRED TO LIVE. AND

01:32:32.346 --> 01:32:34.382
THEN TO THE STAKEHOLDERS TO SEE

01:32:34.448 --> 01:32:35.583
THAT WOULD BE FOR DOING THE

01:32:35.650 --> 01:32:41.923
BEST- POLICY. CHANGES FOR OUR

01:32:41.989 --> 01:32:42.823
STATE THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT THAT

01:32:42.890 --> 01:32:44.458
THE POLL COMMITTEES A- FOR IT

01:32:44.525 --> 01:32:45.293
SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT RE.

01:32:45.359 --> 01:32:46.460
PUTTING A BILL OUT ON AGAIN

01:32:46.527 --> 01:32:48.296
DOESN'T GIVE US ANY TIME AND IT

01:32:48.362 --> 01:32:49.297
DOESN'T GIVE YOU ANY TIME

01:32:49.363 --> 01:32:50.698
EITHER TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER A

01:32:50.765 --> 01:32:53.734
QUESTION SO- I JUST. IT'S

01:32:53.801 --> 01:32:55.970
FRUSTRATING OBVIOUSLY THAT WERE

01:32:56.037 --> 01:32:57.405
BEING PUT IN THE POSITION WHERE

01:32:57.471 --> 01:32:59.006
WE HAVE TO ANSWER TO OUR OWN

01:32:59.073 --> 01:33:01.509
CONSTITUENTS WITH LITTLE OR NO

01:33:01.575 --> 01:33:03.144
INFORMATION AND AGAIN WHEN I

01:33:03.210 --> 01:33:08.883
ASK THE QUESTIONS OF THE BUDGET.

01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:09.450
COMMITTEE I DON'T HAVE THOSE

01:33:09.517 --> 01:33:10.251
ANSWERS SO IF YOU'RE NOT FOR.

01:33:10.318 --> 01:33:10.885
HOW DO YOU EXPECT A TO BE PRE.

01:33:10.952 --> 01:33:11.686
TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER TO OUR

01:33:11.752 --> 01:33:12.887
SINCE THE- NOT ALL OF THE

01:33:12.954 --> 01:33:14.855
DISTRICTS ARE THE SAME. AND SO

01:33:14.922 --> 01:33:16.791
I WOULD LIKE THAT ANSWER AS TO

01:33:16.857 --> 01:33:18.592
WHAT IF ANY OF THE MONEY HAS

01:33:18.659 --> 01:33:20.761
BEEN SPENT. AND IF SO. IF WE

01:33:20.828 --> 01:33:22.830
DON'T HAVE GUIDANCE THAT I WAS

01:33:22.897 --> 01:33:23.731
TOLD THAT THAT WAS THE REASON

01:33:23.798 --> 01:33:24.899
WE'RE DOING THIS BILL IS FOR

01:33:24.966 --> 01:33:26.033
GUIDANCE FOR THOSE SIX MILLION

01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:27.702
DOLLARS. THEN HOW DO WE SPEND

01:33:27.768 --> 01:33:29.203
THAT MONEY WITHOUT ANY GUIDANCE

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:31.405
WHAT FOR THE- ADDITIONAL

01:33:31.472 --> 01:33:33.774
QUESTION IS. IF WE SPENT MONEY

01:33:33.841 --> 01:33:35.476
WHAT DID WE SPEND IT ON AND WAS

01:33:35.543 --> 01:33:37.912
IT RELATED TO- SPECIFICALLY

01:33:37.979 --> 01:33:39.680
THIS BILL THAT WE'RE- BEING

01:33:39.747 --> 01:33:43.551
ASKED TO- LOOK AT TODAY.

01:33:43.617 --> 01:33:46.654
SERVICES TAKE A STAB AT THIS AS

01:33:46.721 --> 01:33:48.456
WELL. THIS REVIEW SO I THINK

01:33:48.522 --> 01:33:50.891

THE BUDGET LAST YEAR ALTHOUGH

01:33:58.199 --> 01:34:00.067
IS FOR A BROADER PURPOSE. WE

01:34:00.134 --> 01:34:01.802
FELT THAT THIS IS A VERY NARROW

01:34:01.869 --> 01:34:03.371
SET OF WORKERS THESE ARE GET

01:34:03.437 --> 01:34:05.940

OF THE SIX BILLION DOLLARS AS

01:34:17.184 --> 01:34:19.086
OF THE READY APPROPRIATE IN THE

01:34:19.153 --> 01:34:21.389
BUDGET COULD BE USED IN AGAIN.

01:34:21.455 --> 01:34:22.456

01:34:35.236 --> 01:34:37.138
ANSWERED. THAT THIS WAS BECAUSE

01:34:37.204 --> 01:34:38.339
OF THE SIX MILLION DOLLARS LAST

01:34:38.406 --> 01:34:40.007
YEAR THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING THAT

01:34:40.074 --> 01:34:40.775
QUESTION A LOT YOU'RE SAYING

01:34:40.841 --> 01:34:42.676

KING I THAT'S WHY I ASKED OVER

01:34:53.054 --> 01:34:54.388
THE WEEKEND AND YOU SAID

01:34:54.455 --> 01:34:56.257
SPECIFICALLY THE SIX MILLION

01:34:56.323 --> 01:34:57.691
DOLLAR PARTS ONE DOLLAR IS LAST

01:34:57.758 --> 01:34:59.493
YEAR'S BUDGET BUT WAS NOT ABLE

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:00.327

01:35:01.796 --> 01:35:03.397
DISCUSSION THIS YEAR WE WERE

01:35:03.464 --> 01:35:04.532
ABLE TO FIND AGREEMENT WITH THE

01:35:04.598 --> 01:35:06.233

TELLS ME ON THE SIX MILLION

01:35:07.568 --> 01:35:10.171

DOLLARS. YOU DIDN'T SAY GOING

01:35:10.838 --> 01:35:12.406

01:35:21.182 --> 01:35:23.851
VERY NARROW SET OF FOLKS FOR

01:35:23.918 --> 01:35:25.119

DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THE

ALL RIGHT IT'LL BE NOBODY'S

01:39:22.323 --> 01:39:23.891
SURPRISE THAT I WANT TO FOCUS

01:39:23.957 --> 01:39:28.295
ON WILDFIRE- AND SO. LET ME I

01:39:28.362 --> 01:39:29.763
WANT TO DIG THROUGH SOME OF

01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:30.331
THESE THINGS BECAUSE I THINK

01:39:30.397 --> 01:39:33.000
IT'S IMPORTANT HISTORY- WE

01:39:33.067 --> 01:39:33.834
TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE NINE OH

01:39:33.901 --> 01:39:36.737
ONE DEAL- WHICH WAS A

01:39:36.804 --> 01:39:39.239
SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENT I

01:39:39.306 --> 01:39:41.542
THINK OF THIS LEGISLATURE-

01:39:41.608 --> 01:39:43.010
SENATOR DOLLY I KNOW PLAYED A

01:39:43.077 --> 01:39:46.680
VERY KEY ROLE- IN NEGOTIATING

01:39:46.747 --> 01:39:47.381
TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A

01:39:47.448 --> 01:39:49.750
YEAR. FROM GIGI R. F. THAT

01:39:49.817 --> 01:39:52.486
WOULD BE PART OF THAT. OF THAT

01:39:52.553 --> 01:39:53.087
PACKAGE TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE

01:39:53.153 --> 01:39:56.890
DOING- NOT EVERYTHING BUT

01:39:56.957 --> 01:39:57.524
MAKING A SIGNIFICANT

01:39:57.591 --> 01:39:59.793
IMPROVEMENT ON THE MONEY GOING

01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:03.063
INTO- WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND

01:40:03.130 --> 01:40:06.433
FUELS REDUCTION- ONE THING IS

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:08.502
MISSING FROM THIS PACKAGE IS

01:40:08.569 --> 01:40:10.003
THERE WAS A LOT OF REPUBLICAN

01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:13.207
INFLUENCE. ON NINE OH ONE AND

01:40:13.273 --> 01:40:14.975
AS FAR AS I KNOW NONE OF US

01:40:15.042 --> 01:40:16.510
WERE ASKED TO BE PART OF THE

01:40:16.577 --> 01:40:18.412
NEGOTIATIONS ON THIS PACKAGE

01:40:18.479 --> 01:40:20.314
AND I THINK THAT'S PROBLEMATIC.

01:40:20.381 --> 01:40:22.082
ESPECIALLY ONE AS MANY OF OUR

01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:22.649
DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN BURNING

01:40:22.716 --> 01:40:27.087
DOWN. WE NEED TO BE PART OF

01:40:27.154 --> 01:40:29.123
THIS DISCUSSION GOING FORWARD

01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:30.457
AND I WAS MISSING AND I THINK

01:40:30.524 --> 01:40:34.027
THAT'S A PROBLEM- ON THE NINE

01:40:34.094 --> 01:40:35.729

01:40:39.633 --> 01:40:41.135
LAST YEAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT WE

01:40:41.201 --> 01:40:42.536
DID NOT GET THAT TWO HUNDRED

01:40:42.603 --> 01:40:44.271
MILLION BECAUSE OF THE GDR OF

01:40:44.338 --> 01:40:46.373
FUND NOT THE OPTION NOT

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.575
GENERATING ENOUGH MONEY. IS

01:40:48.642 --> 01:40:51.011
THAT CORRECT AND- WAS THAT

01:40:51.078 --> 01:40:52.279
MONEY MADE UP AT ALL IN LAST

01:40:52.346 --> 01:40:57.951
YEAR'S BUDGET. I'LL HAVE A

01:40:58.018 --> 01:41:01.221

01:48:04.311 --> 01:48:05.579
THEY WERE TARGETED WITH MONEY

01:48:05.645 --> 01:48:07.514
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN. MONEY

01:48:07.581 --> 01:48:09.716
GOT TARGETED ELSEWHERE THE

01:48:09.783 --> 01:48:11.818
PROBLEM IS THIS LANGUAGE IN THE

01:48:11.885 --> 01:48:13.553
BUDGET DOESN'T SPECIFY THAT

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:15.021
THOSE CONSERVANCY IS USE THE

01:48:15.088 --> 01:48:17.557
MONEY FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION OR

01:48:17.624 --> 01:48:18.925
SORRY FIRE PREVENTION OF FUELS

01:48:18.992 --> 01:48:20.393
REDUCTION THEY COULD USE THE

01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:22.329
MONEY TO GO BUY ADDITIONAL LAND

01:48:22.395 --> 01:48:24.264
OR BY ADDITIONAL EASEMENTS

01:48:24.331 --> 01:48:25.165
THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS

01:48:25.232 --> 01:48:26.700
LANGUAGE THE SAYS THEY CAN'T DO

01:48:26.766 --> 01:48:29.336
THAT. AND WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT

01:48:29.402 --> 01:48:30.203
MONEY'S GOING TO GO TO WHERE

01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:32.439
THE REAL PROBLEM IS. WHICH IS

01:48:32.505 --> 01:48:33.740
ON FEDERAL LANDS WHERE WE

01:48:33.807 --> 01:48:35.108
CONSTANTLY SAY THAT PEOPLE

01:48:35.175 --> 01:48:36.409
CONSTANTLY SAY THAT ALMOST A

01:48:36.476 --> 01:48:38.211
FEDERAL LANDS PROBLEM. WELL NOW

01:48:38.278 --> 01:48:40.113
WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THE FEDS

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:42.582
TO DO A MILLION ACRES A YEAR.

01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:43.750
AND WE HAVE MONEY THAT WE CAN

01:48:43.817 --> 01:48:46.119
INVEST IN IT LET'S TARGETED.

01:48:46.186 --> 01:48:46.720
TOWARDS WHERE THE REAL PROBLEM

01:48:46.786 --> 01:48:50.624
IS. WE'RE TALKING LIKE TEN FOOT

01:48:50.690 --> 01:48:51.358
TALL BRUSH PILES AND SOME OF

01:48:51.424 --> 01:48:53.560
THESE AREAS. YOU'RE NT GOING

01:48:53.627 --> 01:48:54.928
TO STOP THAT UNLESS YOU GET RID

01:48:54.995 --> 01:48:56.496
OF IT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT

01:48:56.563 --> 01:48:58.665
DROVE THE CAMPFIRE. THAT'S WHAT

01:48:58.732 --> 01:49:00.500
DROVE THE FIRE THAT WIPED OUT

01:49:00.567 --> 01:49:02.135
VERY VERY CREEK WE ACTUALLY THE

01:49:02.202 --> 01:49:05.505
FEDS LET THAT FIRE BURN. FOR

01:49:05.572 --> 01:49:09.776
WEEKS AND THEN IT TOOK OFF AND

01:49:09.843 --> 01:49:10.343
CAME THROUGH AND DESTROYED A

01:49:10.410 --> 01:49:12.379
WHOLE COMMUNITY. WHY ARE WE

01:49:12.445 --> 01:49:14.080
FOCUSING THIS MONEY ON THE

01:49:14.147 --> 01:49:16.449
PROBLEM THAT'S MY POINT. YOU'VE

01:49:16.516 --> 01:49:17.951
GOT TO GET THAT MONEY TARGETED

01:49:18.018 --> 01:49:19.319
TOWARDS A FUELS REDUCTION

01:49:19.386 --> 01:49:21.421
PROJECTS THAT ACTUALLY STOP

01:49:21.488 --> 01:49:24.257
THESE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES.

01:49:24.324 --> 01:49:25.659
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT

01:49:25.725 --> 01:49:27.627
THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING TO THE

01:49:27.694 --> 01:49:29.396
TO THE HEART AND HE CORE OF

01:49:29.462 --> 01:49:29.963
THE PROBLEM WE HAVE A GREAT

01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:32.499
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. WE'RE

01:49:32.565 --> 01:49:34.467
MAKING PROGRESS ON IT BUT NOW

01:49:34.534 --> 01:49:35.535
THAT WE'RE SITTING HERE WITH

01:49:35.602 --> 01:49:37.103
MONEY AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE

01:49:37.170 --> 01:49:39.673
AN INVESTMENT. IT'S IMPORTANT

01:49:39.739 --> 01:49:41.541
THAT MONEY BE TARGETED TOWARDS

01:49:41.608 --> 01:49:43.643

SPECIFIC PROJECTS ON FEDERAL

01:50:00.026 --> 01:50:01.528
LAND BECAUSE THE STATE DOESN'T

01:50:01.594 --> 01:50:02.529
HAVE JURISDICTION OF THE

01:50:02.595 --> 01:50:04.164

WITH THOSE REGIONAL

01:50:14.107 --> 01:50:15.508
COLLABORATIONS WEBER THERE'S AN

01:50:15.575 --> 01:50:16.876
EXPECTATION THAT THE FEDERAL

01:50:16.943 --> 01:50:17.911
FUNDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:50:17.978 --> 01:50:19.546
WILL ALSO PROVIDE FUNDING. AND

01:50:19.612 --> 01:50:21.247
HELP TO TAKE CARE OF LAND THAT

01:50:21.314 --> 01:50:22.882
IT HAS JURISDICTION OVER NO WE

01:50:22.949 --> 01:50:24.451

ISN'T GOING TOWARDS FEDERAL

01:50:45.438 --> 01:50:47.273
LAND ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT TRUE

01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:49.776
THE FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS THAT

01:50:49.843 --> 01:50:53.279
WE- THAT WE GIVE OUT AS A STATE

01:50:53.346 --> 01:50:53.847
THOSE CAN BE USED ON FEDERAL

01:50:53.913 --> 01:50:56.282
LAND. I'M SORRY IF THE LAST

01:50:56.349 --> 01:50:57.550
PART OF MY COMMENT DIDN'T COME

01:50:57.617 --> 01:50:58.351
THROUGH CLEARLY WHAT I WAS

01:50:58.418 --> 01:50:59.986
SAYING IS YES WE DO USE SOME OF

01:51:00.053 --> 01:51:01.254
OUR GRANT DOLLARS TO DO

01:51:01.321 --> 01:51:02.789
PROJECTS ON FEDERAL LAND. THAT

01:51:02.856 --> 01:51:05.325
IS CORRECT. RIGHT AND WE HAVE

01:51:05.392 --> 01:51:06.426
SOME SIGNIFICANT MONIES IN

01:51:06.493 --> 01:51:07.660
THERE BUT I'M SAYING THAT'S

01:51:07.727 --> 01:51:09.062
THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF PROJECTS

01:51:09.129 --> 01:51:10.597
THAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED IN ON

01:51:10.663 --> 01:51:11.898
RIGHT NOW IT'S SEVENTY THREE

01:51:11.965 --> 01:51:13.833
MILLION GENERAL FUND. AND FIFTY

01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:15.135
MILLION GIGI R. F. IN THOSE

01:51:15.201 --> 01:51:19.606
WILDFIRE PREVENTION. GRANTS.

01:51:19.672 --> 01:51:21.007
BUT WE COULD FOCUS FOR INSTANCE

01:51:21.074 --> 01:51:23.009
THAT. THAT 20% IS NOW JUST

01:51:23.076 --> 01:51:25.845
FOCUSED ON. STATE LANDS WE

01:51:25.912 --> 01:51:27.414
COULD PULL MORE OF THAT MONEY

01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:29.482
INTO THE GRANT PROGRAM AND GET

01:51:29.549 --> 01:51:30.650
AND GET OUT MORE OF THESE

01:51:30.717 --> 01:51:33.787
PROJECTS CORRECT. SO BETWEEN

01:51:33.853 --> 01:51:34.988
FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE

01:51:35.055 --> 01:51:36.289
PREVENTION GRANTS THOSE TWO

01:51:36.356 --> 01:51:38.291
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THERE IS TWO

01:51:38.358 --> 01:51:39.025
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT

01:51:39.092 --> 01:51:40.360
MILLION DOLLARS BEING MADE

01:51:40.427 --> 01:51:42.028
AVAILABLE ALL OF THAT GOES

01:51:42.095 --> 01:51:43.930
TOWARDS FUEL REDUCTION. IN

01:51:43.997 --> 01:51:46.199
FORCE FOR SELF PROJECTS THAT

01:51:46.266 --> 01:51:47.767
HELP WITH YOUR REACTION. THE

01:51:47.834 --> 01:51:49.469
FORCE WILL PREVENTION GRANTS

01:51:49.536 --> 01:51:50.837
ARE MORE SPECIFIC TO FUELS

01:51:50.904 --> 01:51:52.172
BREAKS AND THOSE TYPES OF

01:51:52.238 --> 01:51:54.340
SPECIFIC PROJECTS. BUT FORCED

01:51:54.407 --> 01:51:55.675
HEALTH GRANTS ALSO HELPED

01:51:55.742 --> 01:51:58.978
MANAGE THE HEALTHY FOREST.

01:51:59.045 --> 01:51:59.512
WHICH HELPS TO MAKE BILL'S

01:51:59.579 --> 01:52:01.214
REDUCTION AS WELL. AND THERE'S

01:52:01.281 --> 01:52:02.715
ALSO A TEN MILLION DOLLAR

01:52:02.782 --> 01:52:04.818
SPECIFIC TO SMALL LANDOWNERS

01:52:04.884 --> 01:52:05.852
AND THERE'S FIFTEEN MILLION

01:52:05.919 --> 01:52:07.720
DOLLARS FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE AND

01:52:07.787 --> 01:52:09.355
HAND CREWS THAT ARE ALSO ABOUT

01:52:09.422 --> 01:52:11.124
FUELS REDUCTION. THERE ARE A

01:52:11.191 --> 01:52:11.958
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT GRANT

01:52:12.025 --> 01:52:13.259
PROGRAMS IN HERE THAT ARE

01:52:13.326 --> 01:52:15.195
FOCUSED ON FUELS REDUCTION I

01:52:15.261 --> 01:52:16.563
WOULD SAY THE VAST MAJORITY OF

01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:18.598
THIS EVEN THE STATE PROJECTS

01:52:18.665 --> 01:52:20.100
FOR PARKS AND FISH AND THE

01:52:20.166 --> 01:52:23.203
CONSERVANCIES ARE FOCUSED ON

01:52:23.269 --> 01:52:23.736
FUELS REDUCTION. AND FIRE

01:52:23.803 --> 01:52:26.573
PREVENTION. MISTER CHAIRMAN MY

01:52:26.639 --> 01:52:28.108
LAST QUESTION IS SO I JUST

01:52:28.174 --> 01:52:29.275
DECLARE I MEAN I THINK THAT WAS

01:52:29.342 --> 01:52:31.411
GOOD THAT SUMMED IT UP IS TWO

01:52:31.478 --> 01:52:32.011
HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION

01:52:32.078 --> 01:52:33.146
THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TOWARDS

01:52:33.213 --> 01:52:35.281
REAL FUELS REDUCTION. OUT OF

01:52:35.348 --> 01:52:36.683
THIS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT

01:52:36.749 --> 01:52:37.917
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I THINK

01:52:37.984 --> 01:52:39.853
THAT WAS GOOD TO HIGHLIGHT. AND

01:52:39.919 --> 01:52:42.856
THEN. BUT YOU CAN PUT A LOT OF

01:52:42.922 --> 01:52:43.957
MONEY TO PROJECTS BUT WE NEED

01:52:44.023 --> 01:52:45.425
TO DO THE STREAMLINING OF

01:52:45.492 --> 01:52:47.360
SEQUEL- IN ORDER TO GET. OUT

01:52:47.427 --> 01:52:48.294
THESE PROJECTS THE

01:52:48.361 --> 01:52:50.230
ADMINISTRATION DID THIRTY FIVE.

01:52:50.296 --> 01:52:52.298
STREAMLINED PROJECTS THAT THAT

01:52:52.365 --> 01:52:54.567
I APPLAUD THEM ON. HOW MANY

01:52:54.634 --> 01:52:57.137
MORE ARE WE DOING. WITH THIS

01:52:57.203 --> 01:52:58.705
MONEY UNDER THAT SAME SEEK WAS

01:52:58.771 --> 01:52:59.906
STREAMLINING BECAUSE IF YOU IF

01:52:59.973 --> 01:53:01.574
YOU DON'T REMOVE THOSE BARRIERS

01:53:01.641 --> 01:53:03.376
YOU COULD HAVE MONEY LIKE VERY

01:53:03.443 --> 01:53:05.411
CREEK DID THEY HAVE THE MONEY.

01:53:05.478 --> 01:53:07.547
TO DO FOR FUELS MANAGEMENT

01:53:07.614 --> 01:53:09.516
AROUND THE TOWN BUT THEY HAD TO

01:53:09.582 --> 01:53:10.917
GO THROUGH A FULL SEQUEL-

01:53:10.984 --> 01:53:12.952
REVIEW AND THEY WERE STOPPED

01:53:13.019 --> 01:53:15.121
HIM SHE WILL NOT WORK SO WHAT

01:53:15.188 --> 01:53:16.189
IS THE ADMINISTRATION DOING ARE

01:53:16.256 --> 01:53:17.857
WE DOING DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF

01:53:17.924 --> 01:53:21.161
PROJECTS UNDER THAT STREAMLINED

01:53:21.227 --> 01:53:22.929
METHOD. OR NOT. SO I DON'T

01:53:22.996 --> 01:53:24.531
REMEMBER THE EXACT DATE BUT

01:53:24.597 --> 01:53:25.899
RECENTLY THE CAL VTP THE

01:53:25.965 --> 01:53:27.167
CALIFORNIA- VEGETATION

01:53:27.233 --> 01:53:28.701
TREATMENT PROGRAM. WAS

01:53:28.768 --> 01:53:30.537
APPROVED- WHICH ACTUALLY

01:53:30.603 --> 01:53:32.038
STREAMLINED SEQUEL FOR

01:53:32.105 --> 01:53:33.907
STATEWIDE FOR PROJECTS THAT FIT

01:53:33.973 --> 01:53:35.441
WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THAT AND

01:53:35.508 --> 01:53:37.177
MOSTLY THESE FUELS REDUCTION

01:53:37.243 --> 01:53:38.611
AND FOREST HEALTH PROJECTS WILL

01:53:38.678 --> 01:53:39.412
FIT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE

01:53:39.479 --> 01:53:41.414
DOUBT BE COMPETE. SO THERE IS A

01:53:41.481 --> 01:53:43.049
BROAD STREAMLINED SEQUEL

01:53:43.116 --> 01:53:45.752
ALREADY IN PLACE- BASED ON THE

01:53:45.818 --> 01:53:48.454
COMPLETION OF THAT PLANT. HOW

01:53:48.521 --> 01:53:50.423
MANY PROJECTS. I DON'T KNOW

01:53:50.490 --> 01:53:51.758
EXACTLY HOW MANY PROJECTS TO BE

01:53:51.824 --> 01:53:52.692
FUNDED WITH THE GRANTS THAT

01:53:52.759 --> 01:53:54.527
WILL DEPEND ON THE GROUNDS THAT

01:53:54.594 --> 01:53:56.029
ARE PROPOSED ARE THE- PROPOSAL

01:53:56.095 --> 01:53:57.664
PROJECTS AND PROPOSED AND WHICH

01:53:57.730 --> 01:53:59.866
ONES GET AWARDED- AS WE NOTED.

01:53:59.933 --> 01:54:01.434
THAT A LARGE PORTION OF THIS

01:54:01.501 --> 01:54:03.102
MONEY IS IN COMPETITIVE GRANT

01:54:03.169 --> 01:54:05.305
PROGRAMS SO A LARGELY DEPEND ON

01:54:05.371 --> 01:54:06.806
WHICH PROJECTS PROPOSED NOTABLY

01:54:06.873 --> 01:54:08.441
GET AWARDED OBVIOUSLY IF THAT'S

01:54:08.508 --> 01:54:10.643
A WHOLE BUNCH OF- LARGE DOLLAR

01:54:10.710 --> 01:54:11.477
PROJECTS TO BE FEWER NUMBER

01:54:11.544 --> 01:54:13.913
PROJECTS IF IT'S- ON A LARGE

01:54:13.980 --> 01:54:15.081
NUMBER OF SMALL DOLLAR PROJECTS

01:54:15.148 --> 01:54:16.416
THEN DIDN'T THE NUMBER PROJECTS
