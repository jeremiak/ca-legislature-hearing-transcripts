WOMEN'S SELECT COMMITTEE ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. AND I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE BOTH OUR PANELISTS WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM AND THERE'S YOU THE CAME TODAY. TO WITNESS OUR COMMITTEE HEARING. AND WE'RE FORTUNATE TODAY TO HAVE A ROBUST SET OF PANELISTS GATHER TOGETHER WITH US WE'VE A RANGE OF EXPERTS IN THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SPACE INCLUDING RESEARCHERS. PROVIDERS PATIENCE AND ADVOCATES AND THEY'RE GONNA SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH US HERE TODAY. I WANT TO START BY BEING VERY CLEAR THAT COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IS UNDER ATTACK ACROSS THE NATION. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON HAS WAGED A WAR ON REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. BUT CALIFORNIA'S LEADERS ALONG WITH MY FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS UNDERSTAND THAT ABORTION IS HEALTH CARE AND IT'S ACCESS TO HUMAN IN ACCESS TO IT IS A HUMAN RIGHT. ABORTION ACCESS IS CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED AND STATUTORILY PROTECTED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OUR CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO MAKE STRIDES TO DELIVER EXPAND AND INVEST IN SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. INCLUDING SAKE ACCESS TO ABORTION CARE. IN FACT IS A HISTORIC ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY PROPOSED BUDGET THIS YEAR WHICH IS SITTING ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AWAITING HIS SIGNATURE. THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING ALLOCATED IN THIS BUDGET WILL ENSURE THAT MORE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE AFFORDABLE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AND AN OBLIGATION TO FIGHT TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS AND EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY CAN STILL ACCESS HEALTH CARE NO MATTER WHAT. IT'S INCREDIBLY DISHEARTENING TO SEE A MOVEMENT ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO BAN ABORTIONS. WE'VE NOW SEEN FIFTEEN STATES BAN ABORTIONS. IN THE PAST FIVE MONTHS. WHICH TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND CABIN ON THE SUPREME COURT STATE POLITICIANS ARE EMBOLDENED TO REGULATE WOMEN'S BODIES AND TRY TO FULLY BAND SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTIONS. BANDS LIKE THIS GO BEYOND RHETORIC. THEY WOULD HAVE DIRE CONSEQUENCES TO THE FUTURE WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY. THESE BANDS WILL PUT WOMEN'S LIVES IN JEOPARDY AND THEY'RE STARTING TO LAND ON GOVERNOR'S DESKS AT A RAPID PACE. THIS ISN'T A COINCIDENCE. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO BAN ABORTIONS OUT RIGHT. AND IT'S IN IT. AND THIS IS NOT JUST AN ATTACK ON ALABAMA OR MISSOURI WOMEN. THIS IS AN ATTACK ON ALL WOMEN. THIS IS AN ATTACK ON OUR BASIC HUMAN RIGHT OF BODILY AUTONOMY. AND THIS IMPACTS EVERY PERSON WHO CAN GET PREGNANT. POLITICIANS ARE DOING THIS IN DEFIANCE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT FOR ACCESS TO SAFE LEGAL ABORTION IS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH AND GROWING. IN FACT RECENT POLLING SHOWS THAT 73% OF AMERICANS. SAY THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE ROE OVERTURNED. ALREADY ONE IN THREE WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE LIVES IN A STATE. WHERE ABORTION COULD BE OUTLAWED FOR A WAS OVERTURNED? THAT'S OVER TWENTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE. A PATIENT'S HEALTH SHOULD DRIVE PERSONAL MEDICAL DECISIONS NOT A POLITICIANS BELIEFS. THESE ISSUES ARE BETWEEN WOMEN AND THEIR DOCTORS. AND WHILE THE NATIONAL ATTACK ON ABORTION IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF MANY MINDS WE MUST ALSO CONSIDER THAT THIS IS NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM THE CALIFORNIA PATIENTS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FACE. ADEQUATE STAFFING FUNDING ACCESSIBILITY ESPECIALLY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AND IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. A SOARING STI EPIDEMIC. IN SAFETY CONSUMER FRAUD AN UNACCEPTABLE MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN ARE JUST SOME OF THE FEW ISSUES AND BARRIERS. TO CARE THE CALIFORNIANS SPACE. pALL OF THE ISSUES THAT WOMEN FACE IN REPRODUCTIVE CARE. I ASKED TO CHAIR THE SELECT COMMITTEE I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO LEARN. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SELECT COMMITTEE. HEARING ON WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA. SEP SIMPLY WE LEARNED THAT THIS SELECT COMMITTEE IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND ACROSS THE NATION. TODAY YOU'LL NOTICE THE LACK OF ANY OF MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES. AS MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE INVITED THEM TO JOIN US. AND THEY DECLINED. WE WANT THIS TO BE A BIPARTISAN DISCUSSION. WE WANT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE TO BE A NONPARTISAN ISSUE. WE INVITE THEM TO JOIN US WHEN THEY'RE READY. SO I SPECIALLY WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES ARE HERE TODAY. FOR THE HARD WORK THEY'VE ALREADY DEVOTED TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL IN CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU SITTING NEXT TO ME WHO AUTHORED ONE OF THE STRONGEST LAWS IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. OUR FIRST HEARING TODAY IS MEANT TO SET A BASELINE ABOUT THE CURRENT STATUS OF OUR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. AND HERE DIRECTLY FROM PROVIDERS PATIENTS AND OTHER EXPERTS ABOUT WHAT THEY FACE ON A DAILY BASIS. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON BEING AT THE FOREFRONT FOR PROVIDING COMPREHENSIVE ACCESSIBLE COMPETENT AND COMPLETE CARE FOR WOMEN. AND MEN IN THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SPACE. BUT WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE EXAMINE HOW THE NATIONAL LANDSCAPE IMPACTS OUR STATE AS WELL AS THE UNMET NEEDS THAT STILL EXIST IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. REST ASSURED THIS WILL NOT BE THE ONLY HEARING OUR COMMITTEE HOLDS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO DIVING IN DEEPER ON THE ISSUES PRESENTED HERE TODAY AND HEARING ZEROING IN ON HOW CALIFORNIA CAN OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES IMPOSED ON US AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AS WELL AS A SYSTEMATIC CHANGES WE CAN MAKE TO IMPROVE CARE AT THE STATE LEVEL. SO WE ARE. AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU DO HAVE ANY COMMENTS ONE OPEN WITH OFFICE OF I'LL JUST SAY A FEW WORDS OF THANKS FIRST OF ALL ONE APPRECIATE. THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR CHAIR AND ALL OF THE LEADERS THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE ROOM. ON A TOPIC THAT I THINK MANY OF US. DID NOT THINK A FEW YEARS AGO WE WOULD HAVE TO BE DEVOTING AS MUCH TIME TO BUT OBVIOUSLY TIMES HAVE CHANGED -- WHEN I ATTEND GATHERINGS OF STATE LEGISLATORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY? ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M ALWAYS REMINDED OF IS HOW. IT IS EASY TO TAKE FOR GRANTED THE ABILITY TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS HERE IN OUR STATE BECAUSE IN SO MANY OTHER STATES. ARE IN OUR COUNTRY -- THESE RIGHTS AS WE KNOW ARE UNDER SALT -- UNDER THREATS IN CALIFORNIA UP BECAUSE OF THE WORK OF SO MANY OF YOU IN THIS ROOM -- WE HAVE A DIFFERENT SPACE TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE FIGHT TO BE ON THE FOREFRONT OF THE FIGHT AND TO ME -- PART OF WHY I'M EXCITED BE PART OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE IS THAT -- WE DO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY IN CALIFORNIA ARE TO LEAD THE NATION AND THAT IS PART OF OUR HOPE OF WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE HERE -- SECONDLY I WANT TO SAY IS -- SINCE THE NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THE STORIES I HAVE HEARD. NOT JUST IN MY CITY BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN HORRIFIED ABOUT WHAT IS POTENTIALLY UNDER ASSAULT -- THE CHAIRWOMAN ALLUDED TO THE CRISIS PREGNANCY BILL THAT I AUTHORED AND I WANT TO THANK ME ROLLIN PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND OTHERS -- FOR MOVING FOR WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS GOING TO BE A SMALL AND NOT A PARTICULAR CONTROVERSIAL BILL TO ADDRESS. FAKE HEALTH CENTERS AND IT PASSED WITH FLYING COLORS IN -- TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IT WITHSTOOD CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES BY -- BY ANTI CHOICE ACTIVISTS IN FIVE FEDERAL COURTS. AND THEN DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED AND NO GORSUCH WAS PUT ON THE BENCH AND THEN THE WILL CHANGE AND BY ONE VOTE -- WE WERE UNABLE TO PROTECT. VULNERABLE CITIZENS OF OUR STATE IN BEING DECEIVED ABOUT FAKE HEALTH CENTERS AND THAT IS IN PART WHY. IT'S SUPPORT AND SUPPORT FOR US TO REGROUP TO THINK ABOUT NEXT STEPS TO THINK ABOUT NEW STRATEGIES. AND ALSO SAYS SOME OF IMMIGRANTS. AND AS THE CHAIR OF THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS ARE TODAY'S AGENDA IN PART FOCUSING ON THE PLIGHT FACING IMMIGRANT WOMEN. I IN IMMIGRANT FAMILIES -- A IN THE WAKE OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO DO NOT JUST TO WOMAN AND HEALTH CARE BUT IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. ALL OF THESE ISSUES ARE INTERRELATED. I IN ALL OF OUR RIGHTS ARE UNDER ASSAULT AND SO FOR ME -- NOT JUST BECAUSE WE ALL SUPPORT THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE -- BUT IF YOU COME AFTER ANY OF US YOU'RE COMING AFTER ALL OF US WE GOT TO STAND TOGETHER SO LOOK FOR THE CONVERSATION I AND WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU SALLY MEMBER CHAU -- SO WE'RE GONNA TURN OUR FIRST PANEL ON THE PANEL WE HAVE SHANNON HOVIS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF NARAL PRO CHOICE CALIFORNIA. DOCTOR CHRISTINE DEL INDOOR FAMILY PHYSICIAN AND DIRECTOR OF THE PERSON CENTERED REPRODUCTIVE. AND DR JENNIFER YORKERS SOCIAL DEMOGRAPHER AT THE LEE INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH POLICY STUDIES I WANT TO WELCOME ALL OF YOU AND I'LL GIVE YOU A FEW MINUTES INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND AND GIVE US AN OVERVIEW. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS SHANNON HOW THIS TIME THE DIRECTOR OF NARAL PRO CHOICE CALIFORNIA. NARAL IS THE LEADING GRASSROOTS REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM ORGANIZATION NATIONALLY WITH TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA AND TWO POINT THREE MILLION MEMBERS NATIONWIDE. AND THEY'RE ALL WE DON'T OPERATE OR LITIGATE WE LEAVE THAT TO OUR PARTNERS AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND THE ACLU. RATHER WE ORGANIZE AND MOBILIZE TO ELECT PRO CHOICE PRO WOMEN LEADERS. AND TO PASS PROACTIVE PRO CHOICE LEGISLATION. NEVER WORKS TO GUARANTEE THAT EVERY PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS REGARDING THE FULL RANGE OF REPRODUCTIVE CHOICES. INCLUDING PREVENTING UNINTENDED PREGNANCY. BEARING HEALTHY CHILDREN. AND CHOOSING LEGAL ABORTION. THIS YEAR NARAL CELEBRATED ITS FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY. AND THE FORTY SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V. WADE. BUT WE ARE NOT A TIME OF CELEBRATION. THIS YEAR ALONE MORE THAN THIRTY STATES HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO BAN ABORTION. FROM THE SIX WEEK BANDS IN GEORGIA AND OHIO TO THE TOTAL BAN IN ALABAMA THE ANTI CHOICE MOVEMENT FEELS THAT OVERTURNING ROE V. WADE IS FINALLY WITHIN REACH AND THEY ARE BAITING THAT HAVE AN AWESOME CREAM COURT. MORE THAN TWENTY CASES ARE CURRENTLY WINDING THEIR WAY THROUGH THEIR QUOTES THROUGH THE COURTS THAT POSE A DIRECT THREAT TO ROE V. WADE. MEANWHILE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS REPEATEDLY TAKEN AIM I REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. I KNOW STATE IS INSULATED FROM THE IMPACT OF THESE TAX. IT IS OFTEN REPEATED THE CALIFORNIA HAS AMONG THE STRONGEST PROTECTIONS ON THE BOOKS FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. THE REALITY IS THAT EVEN IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA. WHERE THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN AN ABORTION AND BEAR HEALTHY CHILDREN IS ENSHRINED IN OUR LAWS? WHERE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO COVER ABORTION AND CONTRACEPTION AND DISPENSED CONTRACEPTION TWELVE MONTHS AT A TIME EVEN IN CALIFORNIA WERE MEDICAL COVERS ABORTION FLOWING TO PATIENTS AND FAMILY PACKED PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE FAMILY PLAN FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES TO LOW INCOME WOMEN AND MEN. MUCH MORE WORK REMAINS TO TRULY ACHIEVE REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. AMONG THE MOST IMMINENT THREATS. ARE THERE TIMES BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO REMAKE GOVERNMENT POLICY ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. OVER THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED REGULATIONS TO PROMOTE ABSTINENCE ONLY EDUCATION. AND CUT FUNDING FOR TEEN PREGNANCY PREVENTION PROGRAMS. PROPOSED REGULATIONS TO ALLOW EMPLOYERS REFUSED TO COVER BIRTH CONTROL FOR NEARLY ANY REASON. JUST BY CLAIMING TO HAVE RELIGIOUS OR MORAL OBJECTION. AND IN STATING ENTITLED HIM GAG RULE WHICH JUST LAST WEEK A THREE JUDGE PANEL OF THE OF THE NINTH CIRCUIT ALLOWED TO GO INTO A FACT. TRUMP IS ALSO ACTIVELY STACKING THE FEDERAL COURTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH ANTI CHOICE JUDICIAL NOMINEES. THE EFFECTS OF WHICH WILL BE FELT FOR DECADES. IF THESE EFFORTS BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CANNOT BE STOPPED AT THE COURTS. CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO HAVE TO BECOME VERY CREATIVE. AND DRAMATICALLY INCREASE OUR FINANCIAL INVESTMENT IN CLINIC BASED CARE TO PROTECT AGAINST THE DEVASTATING IMPACT. TO CALIFORNIA'S ONE MILLION TITLES AND PATIENCE. THE REALITY IS THE CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS SIGNIFICANT ACCESS AND EQUITY ISSUES AND THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IS LARGELY DEPENDENT. UPON ONE ZIP CODE. 43% OF CALIFORNIA COUNTIES DO NOT HAVE AN ABORTION CLINIC. MEETING THE PEOPLE HAVE TO TRAVEL SIGNIFICANT DISTANCES TAKE TIME OFF WORK AND GET FUNDING FOR TRANSPORTATION. AND THERE'S BEEN A 5% DECLINE IN PLANNING SINCE. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THERE ARE NO ABORTION SERVICES INVESTED BY CELL YES TULARE COUNTY OR IN THE ANTELOPE VALLEY. BOTH OF WHICH ARE POPULATIONS OF NEARLY HALF A MILLION. EVEN FOR MEDICATION ABORTION WOMAN FROM BY SO YOU HAVE TO TRAVEL TO FRESNO A FORTY SEVEN MILE DRIVE EACH WAY. AT THE SINGLE ABORTION CLINIC IN BAKERSFIELD NAY REMEMBERS REPORT MONTH LONG WAITING PERIODS JUST TO GET APPOINTMENT FOR LONG ACTING REVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTION LIKE IEDS. AND EVEN IN URBAN CENTERS LIKE LOS ANGELES. THERE ARE MEMBERS HAVE FACED DELAYS OF SEVERAL WEEKS TO GET A PERMIT FOR ABORTION. A TWO THOUSAND TWENTY IS AT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN STUDY FROM ADVANCING NEW STANDARDS AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH UCSF. FROM THE AMONG MEDI CAL RECIPIENTS 12% OF WOMEN TRAVEL FIFTY MILES OR MORE. AND 4% TRAVELED A HUNDRED MILES OR MORE FROM MEDICAL COVERED ABORTION. AMONG RURAL WOMEN 51% HAD TO TRAVEL FIFTY MILES OR MORE. AND ACCESS IS NOT THE ONLY BARRIER. WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION UNDERMINING REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM UNDER THE GUISE OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. THE ANTI CHOICE MOVEMENT IS GROWING ITS NETWORK A FAKE WOMEN'S HEALTH CENTERS. SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS. THESE ESTABLISHMENTS PRESENT EVER SOUGHT AS IF THEY ARE LEGITIMATE CLINIC. BUT USE MISINFORMATION MANIPULATION AND COERCION TO ACHIEVE THEIR SOLE PURPOSE WHICH IS TO PREVENT PREGNANT PEOPLE FROM ACCESSING ABORTION CARE. REGARDLESS OF THE PERSON'S OWN DESIRES. CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE FAKE WOMEN'S HEALTH CENTERS. CONTRASTED TO CALIFORNIA'S ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO ABORTION CLINICS. AND BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT STRUCK DOWN THE REPRODUCTIVE FACT ACT WHEN YOU'RE AGO. NONE OF THESE FAKE CLINICS ARE PART PRIVATE PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY CALIFORNIANS ABOUT THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE. NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THAT WORK OF FAKE CLINICS HAS BEEN AWARDED TITLE TEN FUNDING IN CALIFORNIA. THE OVER A GROUP WHICH IS BASED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DESCRIBES ITSELF AS LED BY GOD AND HAS MADE CLEAR IT IS TRYING TO PUT PLANNED PARENTHOOD OUT OF BUSINESS. THEY HAVE BEEN AWARDED AS MUCH AS FIVE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS. SIMULTANEOUSLY RELIGIOUS HOSPITALS ARE LOOKING TO EXPAND THEIR REACH. RECENTLY THE UC BOARD OF REGENTS CONSIDERED EXPANDING A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN YOU CASF. AND THE CATHOLIC HOSPITAL NETWORK DIGNITY HEALTH. WHICH IS THE LARGEST NONPROFIT HOSPITAL NETWORK IN CALIFORNIA ALREADY ONE IN SIX BEDS IN CALIFORNIA IS RUN BY A CATHOLIC HOSPITAL. CATHOLIC HOSPITALS FOLLOW POLICIES CRAFTED BY THE U. S. CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS THAT ENDANGER WOMEN AND LGBT Q. PATIENCE. THESE POLICIES CALLED ETHICAL AND RELIGIOUS DIRECTIVES FOR BED ALL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES INCLUDING ALL BIRTH CONTROL METHODS STERILIZATION. MISCARRIAGE MANAGEMENT ABORTION. THE LEAST INVASIVE TREATMENTS FACT TOPIC PREGNANCIES AND SOME INFERTILITY TREATMENTS. AND ALL EFFORTS WERE MADE BY UCSF TO ASSERT THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGES TO THE HEALTH CARE PEOPLE RECEIVED. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT BEAR THIS OUT. DR LORI FRIEDMAN AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR FROM UCSF FROM THE MORE THAN HALF OF OBGYN WHO WORKING CATHOLIC HOSPITALS FIND THEMSELVES IN CONFLICT WITH HOSPITAL POLICIES. FURTHER XIN COVERED THAT IN SOME CASES THE CASES ETHICS COMMITTEES WOULDN'T APPROVE TERMINATING A PREGNANCY EVEN WHEN THE MOTHER WAS FACING DEATH. AS LONG AS THERE WERE A FOETAL HEARTBEAT COULD BE DISCERNED. CALIFORNIA MAY NOT FACE THREATS. FROM EXTREME ABORTION BANS. BUT THE EXPANSION OF CATHOLIC HOSPITALS RISKS PUTTING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA IN CALIFORNIA ON PAR WITH THE LIKES OF GEORGIA AND LOUISIANA. OVER THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR MAINSTREAM NEWS MEDIA FINALLY BEGIN HIGHLIGHTING THAT THE STATE'S PASSING EXTREME ABORTION BANS ALSO PULLED THE RECORDS FOR HAVING AMONG THE WORST MATERNAL AND INFANT MORTALITY RATES IN THE COUNTRY. A WOMAN IN ALABAMA IS FOUR TIMES. HAS FOUR TIMES THE RISK OF DYING DURING PREGNANCY THEN A WOMAN GIVING BIRTH IN CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW THAT IF THESE BANDS ARE ALLOWED TO GO INTO A FACT. MATERNAL MORTALITY RATES WILL ONLY RISE FURTHER. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE AMONG THE STRONGEST PROTECTION FOR ABORTION CARE. WE ALSO HAVE THE LOWEST MATERNAL MORTALITY RATES IN THE COUNTRY. AND THIS YEAR CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BOTH EXPAND ABORTION CARE TO CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. BY PASSING SB. TWENTY FOUR AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO FINALLY ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S PERSISTENTLY HIGH RATES HAVE BEEN TURNING WHAT MORTALITY AMONG BLACK WOMEN BY PASSING US BEFORE. SIXTY FOUR THE STATE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS CALIFORNIA IS NOT DIRE AS IT IS IN OTHER STATES. BUT INEQUITIES IN ACCESS AND QUALITY CONTINUE TO PLAY CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE STATE. EQUITY AND JUSTICE MUST BE PART OF OUR WORK IN CALIFORNIA TO TRULY BE A NATIONAL LEADER FOR REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. THANKS FOR HAVING ME TODAY AND HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISS SERVICE. THE STANDARD UP [inaudible] DOCTOR YEAGER [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS JENNIFER YORKER I AM A SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCHER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. IN THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE I WORK WITH MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS AT THE BIXBY CENTER FOR GLOBAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND THE COLOR BARLEY INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH POLICY STUDIES. WE PARTNER WITH HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS EDUCATORS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO CONDUCT A RIGOROUS RESEARCH ON ACCESS TO FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES. THANK YOU FOR THE CHANCE TO SHARE MY RESEARCH EXPERTISE WITH YOU TODAY. ENSURING ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE. THE BENEFITS OF CONTRACEPTION ARE WIDELY RECOGNIZED INCLUDING EMPOWERING WOMEN TO DECIDE WHETHER AND WHEN THEY WILL BECOME PREGNANT. CALIFORNIA HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN A LEADER IN PROVIDING FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES TO LOW INCOME WOMEN. CALIFORNIA SERVES THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF TITLE TEN CLIENTS IN THE NATION. AND THE FAMILY PACKED PROGRAM PROVIDES FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES TO OVER ONE POINT ONE MILLION LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS. HOWEVER RESEARCH SHOWS THAT MANY WOMEN CONTINUE TO LACK ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION INCLUDING THE FULL RANGE OF CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS AND MANY ARE NOT USING THE METHOD THAT THEY WOULD PREFER TO USE. ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH NEARLY ONE THIRD OF NEW MOTHERS IN CALIFORNIA AT REPORTED THAT JUST BEFORE THEIR PREGNANCY THEY HAD NOT WANTED TO BECOME PREGNANT OR WANTED TO DELAY GETTING PREGNANT. IN ADDITION THERE ARE PERSISTENT DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO FAMILY PLANNING ACROSS RACIAL ETHNIC SOCIOECONOMIC AND GEOGRAPHIC LINES. MY COLLEAGUES AND I CONDUCTED A STUDY AMONG ADOLESCENTS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE FOUND THE ADOLESCENTS LIVING IN RURAL AREAS. HAD LOWER AWARENESS AND USE A FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES THAN THOSE IN URBAN AREAS. WITH THE BEYOND THE PALE PROGRAM AT UCSF I'M WORKING O IMPROVE CONTRACEPTIVE ACCESS FOR ANOTHER DISADVANTAGED GROUP. YOUNG ADULTS ATTENDING COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA. COMMUNITY COLLEGES SERVE A DISPROPORTIONATE A LARGE PROPORTION OF LOW INCOME MINORITY AND FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE IGHLY MOTIVATED TO PREVENT PREGNANCY BUT THEY HAVE LOWER RATES OF CONTRACEPTIVE USE THAN THOSE IN FOUR YEAR COLLEGE. ADDRESSING THE NEED FOR BETTER CONTRACEPTIVE INFORMATION AND ACCESS IS ESSENTIAL FOR HELPING THE STUDENTS MEET THEIR CHILDBEARING EDUCATIONAL AND LIFE GOALS. MY RESEARCH AND THAT OF OTHERS HAS FOUND THAT LACK OF INSURANCE AND COST CONTINUED BE A MAJOR BARRIER TO CONTRACEPTIVE USE. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT LED TO A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE AND THE UNINSURED RATE IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER COST REMAINS A COMMON REASON FOR NOT USING A METHOD OR NOT USING A PREFERRED METHOD. THIS IS ESPECIALLY THE CASE FOR METHODS THAT REQUIRE A PRESCRIPTION. MY RESEARCH AMONG YOUNG ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE WAYS THAT FREQUENT BREAKS OR CHANGES IN INSURANCE COVERAGE CAN DISRUPT ACCESS TO FAMILY PLANNING. WHEN YOUNG ADULTS CHANGE INSURANCE THEY OFTEN REPORTED GAPS IN CARE WELL THEY WERE NAVIGATING A NEW PROVIDER NETWORK AND LEARNING HOW TO USE THEIR NEW PLAN? IN ADDITION THE YOUNG ADULTS THAT WE INTERVIEWED LACK TO BASIC KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF HEALTH INSURANCE YOUNG ADULTS ARE OFTEN CONFUSED ABOUT THEIR COVERAGE WHICH CAN LEAD TO MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT CONTRACEPTIVE COSTS. THEY LACK YOU FROM THE RESOURCES TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THEIR BENEFITS AND HOW TO ACTUALLY USE THEIR INSURANCE TO GET CARE. AND I WANT TO SHARE A QUOTE WITH YOU FROM A TWENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD WOMAN THAT WE INTERVIEWED WHO HAD RECENTLY GAINED EMPLOYER BASED COVERAGE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE. SHE TOLD US I WAS JUST HOPING THAT THE NEW INSURANCE COVER THE BASICS I WAS SCARED WHEN I WENT TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND THEY TOLD ME MY INSURANCE SHOULD COVER MY BIRTH CONTROL. I WAS LIKE THANK GOODNESS BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO HAVE TO PAY THAT WAS MY CONCERN THE COST. PUBLICLY FUNDED CLINICS ARE AN ESSENTIAL SOURCE OF FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES FOR LOW INCOME WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA. THEY ALSO PROVIDE PROVIDE CRITICAL PREVENTIVE CARE AN S. T. I. SCREENING AND TREATMENT. RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT ONE IN THREE LOW INCOME WOMEN REPORTED THAT THEY OBTAINED BIRTH CONTROL FROM A PUBLICLY FUNDED CLINIC. FOR MANY WOMEN WHO RECEIVE CARE AT A PUBLICLY FUNDED FAMILY PLANNING PROVIDER IT IS THEIR PRIMARY OR ONLY SOURCE OF HEALTH CARE. MY STUDY A FAMILY PACKED PROVIDERS ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT THESE HEALTH CENTERS PLAY IN HELPING UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS LEARN ABOUT THEIR INSURANCE OPTIONS AND NAVIGATE THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS. THE NEW REGULATIONS FOR TITLE TEN WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE PROGRAM AND REDUCE THE NETWORK OF PARTICIPATING PROVIDERS. IF CLINICS CLOTHES OR NEED TO REDUCE STAFF AND SERVICE HOURS THIS WILL LIKELY REDUCE ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTIVES AND OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES. ULTIMATELY THIS MAY HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT ON THE LOW INCOME AND UNINSURED WHO RELY ON TITLE TEN FUNDED CLINICS FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE. IN CLOSING WELL CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN WOMEN'S RIGHT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH THERE'S AN ONGOING NEED TO ADDRESS THE GAPS IN ACCESS TO FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES. PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME AND UNINSURED WOMEN AND YOUNG PEOPLE. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY RESEARCH WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU DOCTOR ORDERED DOCTOR DOWN UNDER. THANK YOU SO MUCH MY NAME IS CHRISTINE TALENT OR IF AND I'M A FAMILY PHYSICIAN FAMILY PLANNING PROVIDER AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH RESEARCHER AT UCSF. I FEEL INCREDIBLY LUCKY TO WORK IN A STATE THAT IS CONSIDERED BY MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO BE A REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE OASIS. WHERE PATIENTS HAVE FAR FEWER FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO CARE? FOR BOTH ABORTION AND CONTRACEPTION THAN OTHER STATES. AND I THINK YOU OFFER MAKING THAT A REALITY. BUT I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK BEYOND THE QUESTION OF FINANCIAL COVERAGE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE TO THE BROADER QUESTION OF HOW TO ENSURE THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE POLICY. MAINTAINS A FOCUS ON INDIVIDUALS REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY AND HUMAN DIGNITY. I WANT TO FOR SHARE WITH YOU MY DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT RESURGENT NARRATIVE THAT JUSTIFIES AND PROMOTES ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE BASED ON FIXING THE SOCIAL PROBLEM OF POVERTY. IN OTHER WORDS THE IDEA THAT WE CAN ADDRESS ECONOMIC INJUSTICE IN OUR SOCIETY BY HAVING MORE WOMEN USE CONTRACEPTION AND THEREFORE HAVE FEWER BABIES. THIS NARRATIVE HAS BEEN PROMINENTLY VOICE AS A NARRATIVE AS A MOTIVATION FOR SEVERAL INITIATIVES IN OTHER STATES THAT ARE PROMOTING CONTRACEPTIVE ACCESS IN THOSE GEOGRAPHIES. ALL THIS NARRATIVE CAN SEEM INNOCUOUS AT FIRST IT IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE IT DOES NOT PLACE WOMEN'S HEALTH AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AS A VALUE. IN AND OF ITSELF. NO OTHER HEALTH SERVICE RANGING FROM TREATMENT FOR ASTHMA TO CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATIONS TO TREATMENT FOR DIABETES. NEEDS TO BE JUSTIFIED BECAUSE IT SOLVES SOCIETAL PROBLEMS. WHY IS A SERVICE THAT ONLY WOMEN NEED ANY DIFFERENT AND WHAT MESSAGE DOES IT SEND ABOUT THE VALUE WE PLACE ON REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY WHEN IT IS SEEN AS NECESSARY TO JUSTIFY PROVIDING HEALTH CARE? THAT FACILITATES THIS A TIME TO ME ON THE BASIS OF SOCIETAL BENEFIT. RATHER THAN BENEFIT TO WOMEN THEMSELVES. AN ADDITIONAL DAY ADDITIONAL DANGER OF THESE NARRATIVES IS THAT BY FRAMING WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IS THE SOLUTION TO POVERTY. WOMEN'S REPRODUCTION IS BY DEFAULT ALSO CONSIDERED THE COST OF THIS PROBLEM. AS A RESULT WE CAN BE DISTRACTED FROM THE REAL NEED FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS PROGRAMS THE TRULY ADDRESS THE CAUSES OF ECONOMIC DEPRIVATION. FURTHER THE IDEA THE BY FIXING THE PRODUCTION WE CAN FIX THE SOCIETY HAS A LONG AND SHAMEFUL HISTORY. LOOTING THE HISTORY OF COURSES STERILIZATION IN CALIFORNIA THE TARGETED WOMEN HIS REPRODUCTION WAS SEEN AS UNDESIRABLE. NAMELY WOMEN OF COLOR AND POOR WOMEN. A NARRATIVE THAT WOMEN'S REPRODUCTION IS CAUSING THE PROBLEM CAN EASILY SLIP INTO THE NARRATIVE THAT IT IS CERTAIN WOMEN'S REPRODUCTION THAT IS CAUSING THE PROBLEM. AND LEAD US TO PROBLEMATIC POLICIES AND PRACTICES SUCH AS THE COURSE OF STERILIZATION SCENE IN THE CALIFORNIA PENAL SYSTEM IN THE LAST DECADE. OR LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS TO INCENTIVIZE OR REQUIRE WELFARE RECIPIENTS TO USE SPECIFIC CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS WHICH WERE SEEN IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES. THIS NARRATIVE AROUND WOMEN'S REPRODUCTION ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INFLUENCE CLINICAL CARE WHERE WE'VE INCREASINGLY SEEN PROVIDER PROVIDERS PROMOTE USE OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS THAT ARE PROVIDER CONTROLLED SPECIFICALLY INTRAUTERINE DEVICES AND CONTRACEPTIVE IMPLANTS. IN PROBLEMATIC WAYS AND RESIST REQUEST BY PATIENTS TO HAVE THESE DEVICES REMOVED. EVEN MORE CONCERNING WE HAVE EVIDENCE INCLUDING STUDIES DONE BY MY TEAM AT UCSF. THAT THIS PRESSURE TOWARDS SPECIFIC METHODS IS DIFFERENTIALLY APPLIED WITH WOMEN OF COLOR BEING MORE LIKELY TO HAVE THESE METHODS RECOMMENDED AND TO BE PRESSURED TO LIMIT THEIR FAMILY SIZE. POLICY MAKERS IN CALIFORNIA CAN THEREFORE CONTINUE OUR STREETS STATES TRADITION OF VALUING AND UPHOLDING REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY BY PUSHING BACK AGAINST THIS FRAMING OF WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE AS A MEANS TO A SOCIETAL AND INSTEAD WE CAN MAINTAIN OUR FOCUS ON WOMEN'S RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE. AND THE VALUEOF THEIR REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY. ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY IS THINKING CRITICALLY ABOUT HOW WE JUDGE THE SUCCESS OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AND POLICY. THERE IS AN INCREASE MOVEMENT AWAY FROM THE CONVENTIONAL FOCUS ON PREVENTING WHAT IS CALLED UNINTENDED PREGNANCY AS THE SOLE GOAL A FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMS AND POLICIES. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE CONCEPT OF PREGNANCY PLANNING IS NOT UNIVERSALLY SALIENT OR DESIRABLE FOR ALL WOMEN. AND THAT JUDGING WHETHER PREGNANCY IS CONSIDERED GOOD OR SUCCESS BY WHETHER IT IS INTENDED OR PLANNED CAN THE COLLECT THE REAL FEELINGS OF WOMEN ABOUT THEIR OWN PREGNANCIES. IN WHICH A SURPRISE PREGNANCY MAYBE WELCOME OR EVEN DESIRABLE. IN OTHER WORDS TREATING THE CONCEPT OF AN UNINTENDED PREGNANCY IS A UNIVERSALLY NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOME IN THE SAME WAY THAT A STROKE OR INFANT MORTALITY IS A NEGATIVE OUTCOME. DOES NOT HONOR THE ASPECT OF REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY THAT ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO FIND FOR THEMSELVES WHAT IS DESIRABLE WITH RESPECT TO REPRODUCTION. WELL THIS PROSELYTISING UNINTENDED PREGNANCY AS OUR SOLE METRIC OF SUCCESS IS DEFINITELY CURRENTLY ON THE CUTTING EDGE IN OUR FIELD. I ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO THINK ABOUT HOW THE FOCUS ON PREGNANCY INTENTION IS REFLECTIVE OF AN OVERLY SIMPLISTIC AND PRESCRIPTIVE MANNER WE HAVE OF THINKING ABOUT AN ACTING ON WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE CAPACITY. MOVING FORWARDS WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS NEW METRICS THAT MORE COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESS HOW WOMEN THEMSELVES FEEL ABOUT THE REPRODUCTION. INCLUDING CONSTRUCTS SUCH AS PREGNANCY ACCEPTABILITY AND REPRODUCTIVE QUALITY OF LIFE. WE ALSO CLEARLY NEED TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE DEGREE TO WHICH REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IS FOCUSED ON THE PRIORITIES OF PATIENTS AS OPPOSED TO CLINICAL SYSTEMS OR OTHER INSTITUTIONS. THIS INCLUDES PROVIDING CONTRACEPTIVE COUNSELING THAT PRIORITIZES WOMEN'S OWN NEEDS AND PREFERENCES WITH RESPECT TO REPRODUCTION AS OPPOSED TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS DESIRE TO HAVE THEM USE THE METHOD THEY CONSIDER TO BE THE BEST METHOD. IT ALSO INCLUDES ATTENTION TO IMPLICIT BIAS AND HOW THAT CAN SHOW UP IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH TARGETING WOMEN OF COLOR. FINALLY I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE ESSENTIAL NATURE OF NOT JUST THINKING ABOUT ABORTION AND CONTRACEPTION WHEN THINKING ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH POLICY BUT IN FACT THINKING ACROSS THE REPRODUCTIVE LIFE COURSE. AS WOMEN OF COLOR ACTIVISTS MADE CLEAR IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES WHEN THEY FOUNDED THE REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE MOVEMENT. REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY IS NOT HONORED WHEN WE ONLY LOOK AT THE QUESTIONS OF THE QUESTION OF WOMEN'S ABILITY TO CHOOSE NOT TO HAVE CHILDREN. WE MUST ALSO PAY ATTENTION TO WOMEN'S ABILITY TO HAVE THE CHILDREN THEY WANT AS WELL WELL AS THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE THOSE CHILDREN'S AND SAFE ENVIRONMENTS. POLICIES CONSISTENT WITH THIS PERSPECTIVE INCLUDE THOSE ENSURING RESPECTFUL MATERNITY CARE FOR ALL BIRTHING PEOPLE. AS WELL AS PUBLIC FUNDING OF INFERTILITY SERVICES. ONLY BY THINKING ABOUT PEOPLE'S REPRODUCTIVE LIVES MORE HOLISTICALLY AS OPPOSED TO SEILING OUT ABORTION AND CONTRACEPTION CAN WE ENSURE AND HONOR THEIR REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY. CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP AND TAKING THIS TYPE OF PERSPECTIVE WAS SEEN IN THE FIGHT OVER THE MAXIMUM FAMILY GRANT RULE. I HOPE THIS VISION OF HONORING AND SUPPORTING REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY ACROSS THE REPRODUCTIVE LIFE COURSE. CAN CONTINUE TO ANIMATE AND MOTIVATE OUR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH POLICY MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ALL FOR FRAMING THIS CONVERSATION OF SUCH A POWERFUL WAY. I WOULD OPEN UP TO MY COLLEAGUES GIVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE PANELISTS [inaudible] NEW. I WILL I WILL I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. FOR COMING AND PARTICIPATING IN THIS SELECT COMMITTEE AND I WANT TO THANK THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE -- FOR SPENDING YOUR THURSDAY AFTERNOON OR LATE MORNING WITH US TALKING ABOUT A CRITICAL ISSUE I'M PROBABLY -- I SHOULD JUST SAY I'M BIASED WHEN IT COMES TO THIS ISSUE I MAY PROUD BOARD MEMBER ON PPL WAY -- IN I'M IN COMPLETE CONTROL OF MY BODY ALWAYS. BUT I I WANTED -- TO ASK A QUESTION BASED ON YOUR COMMENTS DR BECAUSE I TOO AM WONDERING WHAT TRENDS DO YOU SEE ACROSS OTHER STATES ALTHOUGH I KNOW MANY OTHER STATES ARE. SORT OF LESS FLEXIBLE -- THAN OURS BUT WHAT TRENDS DO YOU SEE HAPPENING IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN NORMALIZE THE CONVERSATION AROUND -- REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND FAMILY PLANNING IN A WAY THAT'S ACCESSIBLE TO ALL WOMEN ALL KINDS OF WOMEN ALL AGES I STILL THINK TO YOUR POINT THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FAMILY PLANNING WERE OFTEN TIMES -- THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ABORTION -- BUT IT'S MUCH LARGER THAN THAT IT'S HELPING YOUNG WOMEN UNDERSTAND. SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS AND PROVIDERS IT'S BEGINNING TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE INFORMATION -- IN THE AMBASSADORS TO HEALTHCARE INFORMATION MIGHT NOT BE AS CULTURALLY SPECIFIC -- AS WOMEN WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE IT'S HAVING HONEST CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WOMEN ACTUALLY FIRST. GET INFORMED ABOUT FAMILY PLANNING -- AND IF THOSE PEOPLE ARE THE RIGHT PEOPLE AND IF THEY'RE SHARING WITH THEM THE RIGHT INFORMATION SO FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT FROM THE STATE'S LANDS YOU KNOW WHAT POLICIES CAN WE BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT. TO KIND OF HELP RESET THAT PARADIGM. SO I THINK THAT I THINK THIS CENTRALLY GOES BACK TO MY MY THESIS WHICH IS THAT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED AS HEALTH CARE. AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE OFTEN IS TO CONSIDER IT AS A SEPARATE ISSUE AND TALK ABOUT IT DIFFERENTLY AND THEREFORE WE CREATES STIGMA WE CREATE BARRIERS WE INNER INTERACT WITH THAT OUTSIDE OF THE REST OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT INTERFERES WITH ACCESS TO CARE. AND IN WHICH WE DON'T INTEGRATE SERVICES FOR ADOLESCENTS FOR EXAMPLE AS PART OF MY FAMILY PLANNING SORRY MY FAMILY MEDICINE PRACTICE I TAKE CARE OF OF PEOPLE FROM. ZERO TO A HUNDRED YEARS OLD AND PART OF MY PRACTICE IS WHEN A PATIENT IS AT WHERE IT MAY BE TAKEN CARE OF SINCE THEY WERE BORN COMES IN AT AGE. TWELVE TO THIRTEEN I ASK THE PARENT IF I CAN TALK TO THE PATIENT TO THE TO THE CHILD BY THEMSELVES AND I HAVE A BLOOD CONVERSATION WITH THEM. ABOUT THEIR CONFIDENTIALITY WHAT RIGHTS THEY HAVE TO TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE AND ABOUT HOW THEY CAN ACCESS HEALTH CARE MOVING FORWARD. AND I TALK TO THEM BOTH ABOUT GETTING HEALTH CARE FOR ME BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING THEY MAY NOT WANT TO GET HEALTH CARE FOR ME BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEY'RE GETTING IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR FAMILY WHERE THEY CAN GET HEALTH. SEPARATELY AND I THINK IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ME AS A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE TRANSITIONS OF CARE. ARE SEAMLESS AND THAT WE ENSURE THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THOUGH. THAT BECAUSE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IS CONSIDERED SO SEPARATELY IN OUR SOCIETY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE OTHER AVENUES AS YOU REFERENCE FOR PEOPLE TO GET THE INFORMATION THEY NEED. PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY LOOKING FOR INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET. THROUGH -- MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES FOR ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND WAYS THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT THIS INFORMATION IS CORRECT. ACCURATE SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE AND AGE APPROPRIATE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ASSEMBLYMEMBER GABRIEL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR TESTIMONY DOCTOR AT A QUESTION FOR YOU AND I APOLOGIZE I I CAME IN A LITTLE BIT LATE SO I MAY HAVE MISSED IT BUT I WAS LISTENING TO YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE DISPARITIES IN AWARENESS. ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE CARE AMONG ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS AND JUST DISPARITIES INFORMATION BETWEEN VARIOUS POPULATIONS. IF YOU COULD GIVE US A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL JUST HER ABOUT THE OVERALL LEVEL OF AWARENESS AMONG ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE CARE AND THEN IT IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOUR RESEARCH HAS SHOWN ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN RAISE AWARENESS AMONG. THE POPULATION GLOBALLY AND AMONG YOU KNOW FOLKS THAT MAY NOT POPULATIONS I MAY NOT KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT. WHERE THEY CAN ACCESS REPRODUCTIVE CARRIED ANYTHING THAT SUGGESTS THAT WE AS POLICY MAKERS ARE STATE COULD BE DOING TO HELP RAISE AWARENESS? THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION AND UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE GREAT DATA. TO NOTE ACROSS A POPULATION LEVEL HOW MUCH ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS TRULY KNOW ABOUT THE ACCESS TO ON AND SUBSETS OF THE POPULATION. SHOW THAT OVERALL THERE'S A LARGE WAY TO GO FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW WHERE TO GO FOR FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES AND THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN RECEIVE. THESE SERVICES FOR FREE AND THAT THEIR CONFIDENTIAL. AND WE ARE LEADERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN THE SENSE THAT WE HAVE VERY PROGRESSIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPREHENSIVE SEXUAL HEALTH EDUCATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY YOUTH ACT BUT THERE IS A LONG WAY TO GO TO ENSURE. THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE COMPLYING WITH THAT AND LEGISLATION. I ALSO WANT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE CUTBACKS THAT WE'VE SEEN AT THE STATE LEVEL IN PROGRAMS FOR TEEN PREGNANCY PREVENTION SUCH AS THE COMMUNITY. AT C. C. G. THE COMMUNITY CHALLENGE GRANTS AND MAIL IN. MAL INVOLVEMENT PROGRAM THESE PROGRAMS ARE REALLY AND QUITE POWERFUL FOR GOING OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL SETTING AND IN SOME CASES INTO THE SCHOOL SETTING TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT YOUTH WERE AWARE OF SERVICES. AND TO LINK THEM AND IN. WE CALL A WARM HAND OFF WAY IN SOME CASES ACTUALLY TAKING THEM TO CLINICS. MAKING SURE THAT THEY AND SEE PLAYED OUT HOW THEY WOULD GO ABOUT ACCESSING CARE SO I'M I WOULD BE IN FAVOR FOR REVISITING. STATE FUNDING FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I GUESS IS THERE ARE JUST SORT OF AND YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN ACCESS YOUR RESEARCH THAT WOULD BE GREAT WE CAN. TAKE A LOOK AT IT LATER BUT I'M JUST SORT OF CURIOUS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I MEAN. IS IT 50% AWARENESS AMONG CERTAIN POPULATIONS THAT YOU RESEARCHED AS A 20% AWARENESS ME WHAT A SORT OF THE OVERALL DATA SHOWING US. I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE PUBLICATIONS AND I DON'T KNOW THEM OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT I WILL GLADLY SEND THEM. THAT WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL. CAN YOU GUYS TELL US ABOUT WHETHER WE SEEN ANY TO KLEINER INCREASES IN. RELATED TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IN ASKED YOU GUYS BIRTH CONTROL CANCER WHERE WE GOING IS A STATE. SIR WHAT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE WERE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS YEAR IS REALLY THE S. T. I. S. T. D. HIV. PEPSI CRISIS THAT CALIFORNIA'S ACTUALLY IN IN THAT NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE SEEM TO BE AWARE OF WE RANK AMONG THE WORST FOR SYPHILIS FOR CHLAMYDIA IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY -- AND WE HAD REQUESTED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ADD. AS THE SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS HIV SPECIFICALLY ANOTHER TWENTY MILLION TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS HABSI ANOTHER TWENTY MILLION TO GO AFTER OTHER STDS MESSY EYES. IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR AND I BELIEVE ALL WE WERE AWARDED WAS ABOUT FIVE MILLION TOTAL TO GO AFTER THOSE THREE THINGS. SO -- THIS IS A PRETTY ALARMING ISSUE. I SCOTT WINNER HAS A BILL THIS YEAR THAT WOULD MAKE PREP AND PERHAPS MUCH MORE AVAILABLE THAT WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARD ADDRESSING HIV CRISIS -- WE HAVE PARTY YOU KNOW WE HAVE A A PREVENTATIVE CURE NOW. TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF HIV IT IS ABSURD THAT WE ARE MAKING IT MUCH MORE READILY AVAILABLE. AND SO WE'RE SUPPORTING THAT THAT LEGISLATION -- BUT YEAH SO SPECIFICALLY ON THAT POINT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE ON STDS AND ESTAS. DO YOU HAVE THOUGHTS ON HOW I MEAN THOSE. CHOOSE IF YOU JUST MENTIONED ARE QUITE ALARMING AND YOU ALSO MENTIONED SENATOR WIENER SPELLING FUNDING ARE THERE OTHER THINGS WE SHOULD BE DOING TO ADDRESS THAT CRISIS IN OUR STATE. A LOT OF IT I THINK HAS TO DO WITH -- YOU KNOW DURING THE RECESSION PROGRAMS WERE CUT SIGNIFICANTLY WE HAVE NOT COME BACK. TO RE EVALUATE WHERE THE FUNDING IS FOR THOSE PROGRAMS THAT IS MUCH OF THE REASON WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR A TOTAL OF SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS PACKAGE AND THAT WAS. A SIGNIFICANT COALITION OF THE REPRODUCTIVE. RE AND RIGHTS AND JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WOULD SPUR SIGNED ON TO THAT -- TO THAT BUDGET PROPOSAL. SO -- YEAH I MEAN I I'M NOT NAY REAL IS NOT THE LEAD ON S. T. S. T. I WORK BUT I'M. BUT WE A TON OF INFORMATION I'M HAPPY TO SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU WHAT OTHER ANY OTHER ANY OTHER TRENDS WERE SING IN CALIFORNIA. AS IT RELATES. TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. ARE WE SPOKE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW MANY COUNTIES DON'T HAVE ABORTION CLINICS FOR EXAMPLE OF WHAT DIRECTION ARE WE GOING AND I WE KNOW THE CURRENT STATE OF THINGS IS THAT. MATT HEY WE GOT IN THE WRONG DIRECTION CAN YOU GUYS GIVE US SOME INSIGHT WHAT YOU SEEN. I CAN SPEAK IN TERMS OF TRENDS IN ACCESS AND USE OF CONTRACEPTION AND OVERALL AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN USE OF LONG ACTING REVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS IN. AN IMPLANT BUT OVERALL THERE'S BàN AND THE RATES OF USE OF ANY CONTRACEPTIVE METHOD HAVE REMAINED STABLE. SO IT'S A AND IT'S A LITTLE PUZZLING THAT WITH THE WITH THE GENEROUS AND STATE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE AN INCREASES IN INSURANCE Y. L. WHY WE'RE NOT SEEING A BIGGER. AND SEEING ANY INCREASE AND CONTRACEPTIVE USE IN GENERAL. I'M I ALSO IS I MEAN IT WAS. SO INTERESTING TO HEAR ABOUT THE IMPLICIT BIAS NOT JUST IN -- KAREN CHILDBIRTH BUT ALSO IN AND BIRTH CONTROL AND I WITH THAT LANDS I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT SENATOR MITCHELL'S BILL BUT I HOPE IT ADDRESSES SORT OF THE IMPLICIT BIAS IN CARE FOR WOMEN FROM. CRADLE TO GRAVE BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THERE'S A HUGE ISSUE IN THE WHERE PROVIDING CARE TO WOMEN OF COLOR -- SO THANK YOU. FOR SHEDDING LIGHT ON THAT ISSUE -- SO. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING IN FOR HELPING US. SET THE STAGE ON THE ISSUES AND MEMBERSHIP. SO I'VE HI MOM. IT WAS STRUCK BY SOME OF THE COMMENTS AROUND THE INCORRECT RICE'S AROUND STD RATES AND THIS PAST YEAR THE BUDGET CYCLE I ALSO HAD -- A SPECIFIC BUDGET REQUESTS AROUND SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT DID NOT GET MATT -- AND THE FACT IS OUR STD RATES ARE AT A TWENTY FIVE YEAR HIGH -- WE LEAD THE NATION AND GONORRHEA CHLAMYDIA. LA LEADS THE STATE IN BOTH -- ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT A WE HAVE THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF BABIES BORN WITH SYPHILIS EVERY YEAR. WITH THESE NUMBERS ARE ASTRONOMICAL AND ARE NOT REALLY BEINGDISCUSSED -- PUBLICLY COULD YOU TALK A BIT MORE YOU KIND OF ALLUDED TO THIS BUT WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE REASONS I THINK WE ALL DO BELIEVE THAT INVESTMENT. OF BUDGET DOLLARS IS CRITICAL BUT IT SO MUCH THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CONVERSATION IS IS FOCUSED ON ABORTION AND THE PRO CHOICE FIGHT BUT THERE IS A BROADER CONTEXT HERE THAT -- THAT I THINK WE NEED TO TACKLE WONDERING IF YOU COULD GIVE SOME FEEDBACK ON THAT. SORT OF FOLLOW UP ON THAT IN THE COMMENT ABOUT IMPLICIT BIAS I I WANNA MAKE THE POINT THAT I THINK THAT RESPECTFUL CARE IN THE CONTEXT OF WOMEN WHO ARE NOT PREGNANT IS ACTUALLY MANY TIMES EVEN A BIGGER CONCERN. BECAUSE THESE ARE WOMEN WHO ARE TRYING NOT TO BE PREGNANT AND THAT COMES WITH A SET OF SOCIETAL STIGMA AND JUDGMENT WOMEN WHO ARE SEXUALLY ACTIVE BUT DO NOT WANT TO BE PREGNANT. AND SO THERE ARE ISSUES WITH RESPECTFUL CARE IN THAT CONTEXT AND SPECIFICALLY DIFFERENTIAL RESPECTIVE -- DISRESPECT TOWARDS WOMEN OF COLOR THAT I THINK ABSOLUTELY IMPACTS BOTH USE OF CONTRACEPTION AND USE OF SERVICES RELATED TO SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS SCREENING TESTING AND TREATMENT. AND SO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT IS NOT MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CURRENT BILL DOES ADDRESS IT IN THE FAMILY PLANNING CONTEXT -- STAYS BY MY COLLEAGUE DR NEW GOMEZ AT BERKELEY HAS FOUND THAT WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCES RESPECTFUL CARE IN THE FAMILY PLANNING CONTEXT ARE LESS LIKELY TO COME BACK FOR CARE IN THE FUTURE. AND SO I THINK THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO AS A WAY TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CAN GET THE CARE THAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT WITH RESPECT EVERY FOR CONTRACEPTION. ABORTION BUT AUTHORED ALSO WITH RESPECT TO SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AND I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE DISPARITIES IN FOR TWO WILL INFERTILITY RATES IN THE UNITED STATES. THAT WOMEN OF COLOR ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE TO INFERTILITY RELATED TO THEIR HIGHER LATE RATES OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AND THE SAME WOMEN HAVE LESS ACCESS TO INFERTILITY SERVICES BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL BARRIERS AND THAT IS A AN ISSUE THAT IS. CORD TO REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE RELATED TO WOMEN'S ABILITY TO HAVE THE CHILDREN THAT THEY WANT SO WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT BOTH ADDRESSING THE CRISIS BUT ALSO ADDRESSING THE IMPLICATIONS FOR WOMEN'S ABILITY TO HAVE THE FAMILIES THAT THEY WALKED. THANK YEAR NOW AND I THINK YOU HEADED HOME WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND BODILY AUTONOMY BEING BOTH THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE. TO HAVE A BABY AND NOT SO I THINK THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT. IN A NIGHT. I DO I WOULD JUST ADD I MEAN THAT'S WHY RIGHT WE HAVE ENSHRINED IN OUR REPORT TO PRIVACY ACT THE RIGHT. TO OBTAIN ABORTION AS WELL AS THE RIGHT TO BEAR HEALTHY CHILDREN I THINK THAT. WE FOCUS ON THE RIGHT TO TEN ABORTION BECAUSE IT IS SO CONSTANTLY UNDER ATTACK AND FOR NAY ROUTE WE ARE KNOWN AS THE ABORTION RIGHTS ORGANIZATION. BUT WE ALSO WORK ON THE FULL SPECTRUM OF REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM AND REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM TRULY MEANS HAVING. CHOICE IN ALL IN ALL WAYS RIGHT THE CHOICE TO BEAR HEALTHY CHILDREN WHICH MEANS AN ACTIVE TRACY ARE NOT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN YOUR WORKPLACE. BECAUSE YOU ARE PREGNANT BUT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO PAY FAMILY LEAVE AND SO I THINK THAT. AND THEY THE FORCED -- YOU KNOW THE FOR STERILIZATION ISSUE OF COURSE ISN'T A WOMAN CARILLO. HAS A BILL ON THIS ISSUE THIS YEAR AND LAST AND WE REALLY REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE ALL OF US VETTING REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE MEANS ACKNOWLEDGING. OUR TRANSGRESSIONS FROM THE PAST AND REALLY PAYING -- RESPECT FOR THOSE SO I THINK I THINK THAT THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE IN BOTH. ACKNOWLEDGING THAT REPRODUCTION IS USED AS A TOOL OF OPPRESSION. WHETHER THAT IS. AT IMPOSING SOME A LONG ACTING. IN CONTRACEPTIVE ON A CONTRACEPTIVE ON A PERSON OR FORCING THEM. TO CARRY A PREGNANCY TO TERM EITHER IS A FORM OF OPPRESSION AND WE HAVE TO REALLY BE ACTIVE ON ALL SIDES OF THIS TO ENSURE REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. THANK YOU AND I WANNA THANK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE FOR SHARING YOUR IMPORTANT INSIGHTS ON THIS ISSUE AND I HOPE THIS ISN'T. THE END OF THE CONVERSATION FOR US THANK YOU AND THEN I I WILL NO PROBLEM ASSEMBLYMEMBER COM LONGER DAD ISN'T READY FOR YOU TO LEAVE. I KNOW THAT WHAT HAPPENS IN TWO BUT I JUST WANTED -- TO KNOW IF THERE'S ANY DATA ON THE MAKE UP OF THOSE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THAT ARE PROVIDING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE -- BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WOMEN OF COLOR. WE'RE ALSO SORT OF TALKING ABOUT WHO THE FOLKS ARE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO SEE -- WHO ARE OFFERING THEM CARE WHO ARE OFFERING THEM INFORMATION IN WAYS THAT THEY CAN RESPECT AND RECEIVE -- AND SO DO WE HAVE ANY OF THAT DATA BECAUSE I I THINK THAT SORT OF DRIVES -- A LARGE PART OF THE CONVERSATION. SO WE HAVE A DIVERSITY PROBLEM IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONS WORKFORCE IN THE FAMILY PLANNING HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS NO DIFERENT THEIR HUGE DIFFERENCE THERE ARE HUGE PROBLEMS WITH THIS. AND IN GENERAL IN THE HEALTH COMMUNICATIONS LITERATURE WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT RECEIVING RACE CONCORDANT HEALTH CARE IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER RESPECT GREATER -- PATIENTS CENTEREDNESS AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF EXPERIENCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL RECEIVING THE CARE SO WE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE INVESTING IN A MORE DIVERSE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONS WORK FORCE AND WHILE THAT IS OFTEN A REALLY LONG TERM QUESTION. IN THE FAMILY PLANNING SETTING WHERE MANY PEOPLE ARE MANY PEOPLE PROVIDING FOR EXAMPLE CONTRACEPTIVE COUNSELING ARE UNLICENSED PROVIDERS WHO ARE HEALTH EDUCATORS I THINK WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN ENSURING THAT THOSE PEOPLE. ARE MORE DIVERSE MORE REFLECTIVE OF THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT OF THE POPULATIONS THAT THEY SERVE -- AND WE ARE CURRENT I'M CURRENTLY WORKING ON A PROJECT IN WASHINGTON DC TO ACTUALLY TEST WETHER RACE CONCORDANT PARA PROFESSIONALS PROVIDING CONTRACEPTIVE COUNSELING LEADS TO IMPROVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND PATIENT EXPERIENCE OUTCOMES. BASED ON THIS VERY STRONG HEALTH COMMUNICATIONS DATA THAT SHOWS THAT THAT IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE INVESTING IN. BECAUSE THAT WILL AFFECT THE IMMEDIATE EXPERIENCE OF CARE ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN OF COLOR BUT ALSO LONG TERM REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES INCLUDING MATERNITY CARE OUTCOMES BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE. WITH CONTRACEPTIVE PROVIDER YOU'RE GOING TO BE MORE LIKELY TO COME IN EARLIER FOR PRENATAL CARE TO TO BE TO BE -- TO BE -- CONSISTENT WITH YOUR VISITS AND TO GET THE CARE THAT YOU NEED. AND I HOPE YOU'LL KEEP US POSTED ON THAT RESEARCH ISSUE. SOME OF THE FINDINGS INTERESTING WORK SO THANK YOU ALL WE WILL SWITCH TO THE SECOND PANEL WHICH IS OUR PANEL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BEING HERE HOW CAN COME ON UP AND JOIN US AND HOPEFULLY OUR NAMES ARE ON BOTH SIDES SO YOU CAN SEE MAKE SURE YOU THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US -- OUR SECOND PANEL WHICH IS ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES WE HAVE MICHELLE SEMANSKY THE DIRECTOR OF SAFETY AND SECURITY FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD MY MONTE -- WE HAVE.

HIGH QUALITY AND COMPASSIONATE CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COMES THROUGH OUR DOORS NO MATTER WHAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU I DON'T KNOW IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO HAVE A WOULD YOU LIKE CONNECTS -- I'M I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS OLD MYTHS IS MY FIRST TIME DOING THIS -- IN FRANCE THANK YOU -- SO GROWING UP IN CALIFORNIA I WAS THE LAST PERSON IN MY GROUP OF FRIENDS AND MY FAMILY TO START MY PERIOD I WAS. SIXTEEN YOU KNOW I WAS REALLY LUCKY ADAM ON WHO'S REALLY OPEN SHE TALKED TO ME ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT MY LITTLE SISTER HAD ALREADY STARTED SO I KINDA LIKE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN BUT MINE WAS NOT NORMAL -- I KNEW THAT I WAS NOT NORMAL WHEN MY FIRST LASTED ALMOST SIX WEEKS -- I WAS VOMITING MOST OF THE DAYS THAT THAT HAPPENED -- I WAS REALLY LOOKING AT A LOT TEACHERS RIVER SUPPORT OF IN WHICH LIKE LET ME SNEAK OUT KNOWN WOULD QUESTION IT. BUT YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN YOU'RE SICK FOR THAT MUCH OR I WOULDN'T KNOW WHEN MY PERIOD WOULD COME IT WOULD JUST RANDOMLY HAPPEN -- I DID GET LOTS OF OVER THE COUNTER MEDICINE TO HELP WITH THAT BUT THAT JUST WASN'T. ENOUGH -- SO MY PARENTS AND I STARTED FIGHTING PRETTY QUICKLY. FOR ME TO GET BIRTH CONTROL EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T SEXUALLY ACTIVE UP BUT I NEEDED IT TO MAKE MY LIFE A SURVIVOR WILL. AND WE TRIED LITERALLY YOU NAME A BIRTH CONTROL EXCEPT FOR LIKE BOTH THE BAR IN THE ARM I'VE TRIED IT. AND NONE OF THEM WERE WORKING -- THEY KEPT FIGHTING BACK ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF MY AGE LIKE. BY BY THE TIME I WAS EIGHTEEN THEY'RE STILL COOL YOU'RE AN ADULT BUT YOU DON'T REALLY GET TO CHOOSE LIKE WE DON'T THINK THAT WHEN SAFE YOU HAVEN'T HAD KIDS YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE YOUR MIND -- BUT IT MADE IT REALLY HARD FOR ME WHILE IN COLLEGE THINGS GOT A LOT WORSE. MY DOCTOR STILL REALLY DIDN'T TAKE INTO THE FACT THAT I WAS SICK THAT I COULDN'T FUNCTION THAT THINGS WERE JUST EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY IT GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE I DIDN'T KNOW HOW I WAS GOING TO KEEP GOING. AND I WAS TRYING TO GET MY BACHELOR'S IN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND I WAS OUT OF STATE -- I WAS ACTUALLY IN MAINE AT THE TIME EVEN THE GROWING UP HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I IT'S A SCIENCE DEGREE I HAD FOR OUR LABS AT LEAST ONE TO TWO A WEEK LIKE I CAN'T MISS THOSE ARE THINGS MY TEACHERS ARE GOING TO DRIVE OUT THERE MAKE UP THOSE LABS -- IN BECAUSE OF MY ATTENDANCE ME BEING SICK ONE OF MY PROFESSORS ARE REALLY TRUSTED WAS REALLY WORRIED ABOUT ME AND ACTUALLY SUGGESTED THAT I MAYBE WITHDRAWAL -- BECAUSE OF MY ABSENCES IN THAT I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE PASS MY CLASSES BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T ACCEPT ALL THOSE ABSENCES -- AND THAT'S NGUYEN LOCALLY THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD ON CAMPUS I STARTED WHEN MY FRIENDS LIKE GO TALK TO THEM SO I STARTED TALKING TO THEM -- AND THEY IMMEDIATELY WELL WHY CAN'T YOU HAVE AN IUD THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU AT NINETEEN NOT TO HAVE AN IUD WE UNDERSTAND YOU HAVEN'T HAD KIDS BUT THAT'S OKAY -- BUT BECAUSE I WAS ON MY PARENTS INSURANCE THEY STARTED FIGHTING WITH THAT INSURANCE COMPANY SPECIFICALLY TO HELP CONVINCE THE DOCTORS TO GIVE IT TO ME -- AND EVENTUALLY THEY WERE ABLE TO GET IT FOR ME I WAS ABLE TO GET IT THROUGH THEM ACTUALLY INSTEAD OF THROUGH MY INSURANCE AND BECAUSE OF THAT. I KNOW HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE THE FIRST PERSON MY FAMILY EVER TO GET A GRADUATE DEGREE AND THE STATE'S SCIENTISTS I'M ABLE TO DO WORK I LOVE EVERY DAY. AND HONESTLY I WOULDN'T BE HERE TALKING ABOUT THIS IF IT WASN'T FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD I THINK MAKING SURE WE HAVE THAT ACCESS AND THE OTHERS ARE. AS LUCKY AS ME TO GET THAT ACCESS IS SO IMPORTANT THANK YOU MISTER LANDER FOR SHARING YOUR STORY APPRECIATE IT AND YOUR BRAVERY. IT'S NOT EASY TO COME HERE AND SHARE PERSONAL STORY. MR ROUTINE WOULD YOU LIKE. TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF IT'S AN HONOR TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY PERCENT TWO YEAR TODAY. MY NAME IS WARREN ROUTINE I'M THE PRESIDENCY OF EISNER HEALTH OF FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND WE'RE ONE OF THE NETWORK OF COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT COLLECTIVELY SERVE SOME SEVEN MILLION UNIQUE INDIVIDUALS FROM THE TOP OF THE STATE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STATE IN THE OCEAN TO THE DESERT. EISNER HEALTH OPERATES TWENTY LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT LA COUNTY THAT DELIVER COMPREHENSIVE PRIMARY PREVENTIVE CARE DENTAL CARE OBSTETRICAL CARE VISION DERMATOLOGY AS WELL AS COMPREHENSIVE FAMILY PLANNING TO SOME FIFTY THOUSAND UNIQUE INDIVIDUALS. AND WE DO JUST ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND VISITS ANNUALLY. THESE FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT I'M TRULY ARE COMPREHENSIVE AND DELIVERED IN A VARIETY OF SETTINGS. I'M ALSO PROUD CONSTITUENT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER COUNTY -- SO THANK YOU FOR REPRESENTING ME -- IT'S IT'S GLAD I'M THRILLED TO SEE MY REPRESENTATIVE PARTICIPATING IN THIS TYPE OF BATTLE AND THAT MAKES ME VERY PROUD TO BE A RESIDENT F THE FIFTY FIRST. I'M FINALLY I'M A FORMER BOARD MEMBER AND CHAIR OF THE NATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ASSOCIATION I'M WHERE I PARTICULARLY HELPED WORK ON THE INTEGRATION OF PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE WITH REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. FOR THIS HEARING YOU'VE PROVIDED A GREAT LIST OF QUESTIONS WELL ATTEMPT TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THOSE AREAS REALLY QUICKLY WITH YOU -- SOME AREAS IN THE VARIOUS FUNDING AND PROGRAMS THAT YOU ASKED US TO ADDRESS THAT ARE HELPFUL. F. PACKED THE FAMILY PACK PROGRAM WHICH SUPPORTS -- PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE OTHER MEANS OF PAYING FOR THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IS A CRITICAL SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND FOR EISNER HEALTH SPECIFICALLY. I'M IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT AS WE EXTEND CONFIDENTIAL SERVICES TO TEENAGERS -- IN OUR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS THAT PROVIDE FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES IT ALSO WAS A GREAT WAY I'M IN WHICH WERE ABLE TO EXTEND CARE TO UNDOCUMENTED WOMEN. PRIVATE FUNDERS ARE ALSO VERY ACTIVE IN MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR PATIENTS -- YOUR RESPECTIVE OF WHAT THEIR CHOICES ARE SO WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH. A NUMBER OF FOUNDATIONS AND FUNDERS THAT HELP US NOT ONLY PROVIDE CONTRACEPTION AND AND A REPRODUCTIVE CARE IN THAT VEIN BUT ALSO PREPARE WOMEN WHO CHOOSE TO HAVE CHILDREN AND PREPARE THEIR FAMILIES -- TO WELCOME CHILDREN IN LAST YEAR ISTER HEALTH DELIVERED ABOUT TWENTY SIX HUNDRED BABIES I'M IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY MAKING ONE OF MAKING US ONE OF THE LARGEST OBSTETRICAL PRACTICES WITHIN THE COUNTY. DEMAND FOR HEALTH CARE OF ALL TYPES IS NOT WINNING AT ALL ESPECIALLY IN LA COUNTY OR ACROSS LAWS IN ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. DEMAND SIMPLY OUTPACES SUPPLY AT EVERY TURN. WE WE RELY ON PROGRAMS LIKE F. PACKED AND THE MEDI CAL EXPANSION. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE BASELINE REIMBURSEMENT TO BE ABLE TO SERVE THE PATIENTS WHO COME AND PRESENT FOR CARE WITH US. IN THE AFTER PACKED REIMBURSEMENT SPACE. IN THE PAST THERE'S BEEN SORT OF THIS PEAK AND VALLEY AND CHANGES IN THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE AND INSTABILITY -- WHERE LATER IN THE YEAR WE RECEIVE NOTIFICATION THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A CHANGE IN THE OF PACKED REIMBURSEMENT RATE? AND THE LACK OF STABILITY WITHIN THAT -- REIMBURSEMENT MECHANISM PREVENTS US FROM EXPANDING FURTHER AND MAKING PLANS IN A IN A SECURE WAY KNOWING THAT THE REIMBURSEMENT MAY RISE OR FALL DEPENDING ON THE POINT OF THE YEAR. FOR THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING THE CONFIDENTIAL CARE COST AN ACCESS REMAIN A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR THEM TO OVERCOME. PARTICULARLY FOR TEENAGERS WERE SEEKING CONFIDENTIAL SERVICES WITHIN OUR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS AND FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE INSURANCE LIKE THE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION. THERE'S ALSO -- WHEN I CALLED THE FORGOTTEN MIDDLE THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO EARN JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH TO QUALIFY FOR MEDICARE ALL -- BUT NOT ENOUGH TO REALLY BE ABLE TO PAY FOR COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH INSURANCE WITHIN THEIR FAMILIES A MAN WHO. AT AND UP FORGO WEIGHING COVERAGE EVEN THOUGH IT'S AVAILABLE ON THE EXCHANGE FOR THEM. I'M SO THE F. PACKED PROGRAM STEPS IN FOR A NUMBER OF THOSE FOLKS WHO POP JUST OVER THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES LINE AND ALLOWS US TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS THIS CRITICAL CARE IS AVAILABLE TO THEM. ISER IS DOING SOME REALLY INNOVATIVE THINGS WE THANK -- IN ORDER TO EXTEND THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE TO EVERYBODY. NOTABLY IT'S COMPLETELY INTEGRATED INTO OUR PRIMARY CARE PRACTICE SO WE RUN ALL OF OUR PROVIDERS AND OUR STAFF GO THROUGH EDUCATION AND TRAINING SPECIFICALLY ON HOW TO INTEGRATE SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE INTO THE PRIMARY CARE MODEL AND THE FOLKS IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AS WELL -- THE EXPANSION OF THE FAMILY PLANNING INTO THE HIGH SCHOOL SETTING -- AS WELL AS IN CHIU EVEN SOME OF OUR PEDIATRIC PRACTICES FOR WE HAVE PEDIATRICIANS WHO ARE HELPING LEAD THE CHARGE -- AS THEIR PATIENTS REACH ADOLESCENCE AND STARTING TO INTEGRATE THE SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH -- QUESTIONS INTO THEIR HEALTHCARE AS A DOCTOR DESCRIBING THE EARLIER PANEL. IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS WERE DOING VERY WELL AT INVOLVING PARTNERS -- WITHIN THE CARE AND TREATMENT MOST NOTABLY FOR S. T. I. SCREENING AND TREATMENT AS WELL AS FOR CONTRACEPTION. AND FINALLY WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THE ONE KEY QUESTION -- ACROSS ALL OF OUR PRIDE OUR PRIMARY CARE SERVICES WHICH IS THE QUESTION IN WHICH WE ASK THE VERY SIMPLE QUESTION ARE YOU PLANNING ON BECOMING PREGNANT THIS YEAR. IN THE COMING YEAR -- TO WOMEN WHO SEE CARE AND WE'RE ALSO ASKING THE SAME QUESTION OF OUR MALE PATIENTS TO SEE IF THEY PLAN ON HAVING CHILDREN AND IN THE SHORT TERM COMING FORWARD. CULTURAL COMPETENCE IS WHY OUR PATIENTS CHOOSE US I'M 78% OF OUR PATIENTS ARE LATINO LATINA IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE -- WE HAVE A GROWING ASIAN POPULATION WITHIN OUR HEALTH CENTERS AS WELL -- AND THEN IN OUR AREAS IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY SOME OTHER GROWING IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS AND WE SEEK TO OFFER CAREER PATH EMPLOYMENT -- WITHIN OUR HEALTH CENTERS. WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES FOR OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS SO THAT THAT WAY WE REACH THIS CONCORDANCE BETWEEN -- COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SERVING THEM. WE TAKE THEIR CULTURAL RELIGIOUS PREFERENCES OF OUR PATIENTS AND STAFF INTO ACCOUNT I'M AS REQUIRED AND ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE TRAINING OUR STAFF TO ASK CRITICAL QUESTIONS OF THAT WERE MEETING OUR PATIENTS WHERE THEY ARE. IN THEIR OWN LIFE JOURNEY AS FAR AS THAT'S CONCERNED. AND FINALLY WE OPERATE AN OLD NUMBER OF TRAINING PROGRAMS WE HAVE A FULL SPECTRUM FAMILY MEDICINE TRAINING PROGRAM UNDER OUR ROOF -- AND THEN WE ALSO -- WORKED WITH RESIDENTS IN OBSTETRICS GYNECOLOGY AND TRAINEES IN NURSE MIDWIFERY SO THAT TOGETHER -- WE ARE MAKING SURE THAT THIS CARE IS COMPLETELY A PART OF THE GENERAL PRIMARY CARE THAT WE OFFER ALL CARE IS REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY SLIDING FEE SCALES ACCESS TO THREE FORTY BE PRICED DRUGS. ARE ALL HALLMARKS OF THE WAY THAT WERE TEARING DOWN BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. WORKING IN PARTNERING WITH COUNTLESS COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ARE LOCAL PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S -- PREDOMINANTLY AS WELL AS OTHER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT SEEK. OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR PARTICIPANTS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE PRIMARY AND COMPREHENSIVE CARE THAT THEY THAT THEY NEED AND THAT THEY DELIVER. AND DESERVE -- WE'RE VERY PROUD OF OUR MIDWIFERY MODEL OF CARE IN THE DELIVERY OF WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES AND DELIVERIES MOST OF OUR OBSTETRICAL DELIVERIES ARE PERFORMED BY A CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES INTO HOSPITALS WHICH WE STAFF. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE SIXTY FIVE SO THAT IS AN ABSOLUTE CORPS OF THE PATIENT CENTERED MIDWIFERY MODEL THAT WERE SUPER PROUD OF REGULATORY EARLY AND WE HAVE WITHIN THE ASSEMBLY. STABILIZING THE F. PACKED RATES WOULD BE A GREAT OUTCOME FOR US -- MEDIUM AND LONG TERM CONTINUING TO SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF NURSE PRACTITIONER AND CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIFERY TRAINING PROGRAMS. I'M IS A GREAT WAY THE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN PARTICIPATE WITH US -- AND SUPPORTING THE EXPANSION OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS THIS IS A PRIMARY WAY IN WHICH WE ARE ACCESSING INDIVIDUALS WHO TRULY NEED SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE GROWING A POPULATION OF SAVVY HEALTHCARE CONSUMERS AS THEY REACH ADULTHOOD. SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU MISS SEMANSKY MY PLANTS ANYWAY. THANK YOU -- MY NAME IS MICHELLE SEMANSKY AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF SAFETY AND SECURITY FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD MARMONT TODAY BUT I AM ALSO SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA AND ENDS. I WANTED TO TALK TO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TODAY TODAY ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS WE FACE IN MY JOB I DEAL WITH. THREATS TO OUR PATIENTS OUR STAFF AND OUR FACILITIES -- THE PROTESTER RESPONSE HOW WE HANDLE THE ACTIVE PROTESTERS OUTSIDE. OF OUR HEALTH CENTERS AND THE SAFETY TRAINING TO PREPARE FOR WHATEVER MAY BE COMING. AND I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE FACE IS THE PERCEPTION IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE'RE FINE THAT WERE NOT FACING CHALLENGES. THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS CARE THERE ARE NO BARRIERS FOR PATIENTS -- OR OUR STAFF -- AND THAT UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT TRUE WE SEE PROTESTERS WEEKLY OUTSIDE OF OUR HEALTH CENTERS THE NUMBERS ARE GROWING -- AND THAT NUMBER OF DAYS THEY'RE OUT IN FRONT OF OUR HOUSE CENTERS ARE GROWING -- WE HAVE EXPERIENCE VIOLENCE AT OUR HEALTH CENTERS IN JUSTIN'S SINCE TWENTY OF THE TWENTY ELEVEN WE'VE HAD THREE ARE SINCE. AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD SITES IT FOR MY MANTEO LOAN -- AND THIS THESE ARE THINGS WE DO AS ON A DAILY BASIS WONDERING WHAT. THE NEXT SHOE WILL DROP AND WHAT TO EXPECT SO OUR STAFF HAVE TO DEAL WITH. PREPARING FOR THE UNIMAGINABLE AND PREPARING FOR THE UNEXPECTED AND KEEPING AN EYE OUT DAILY FOR WHAT MIGHT BE COMING THROUGH THE DOOR WE CALL IT LOOKING OUT FOR THE CRAZY -- AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT LEADS TO A HIGH LEVEL OF ANXIETY AMONG THEIR STAFF. IN TERMS OF NOT KNOWING. WHERE THE NEXT WEIRD THING OR DANGEROUS THING MIGHT BE COMING FROM WE DO THE BEST THAT WE CAN TO PREPARE -- BUT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THINGS THAT OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS DON'T WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH BOMB THREATS. WE HAVE WE PREPARE STAFF TO DEAL WITH SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES AND WHAT TO DO OF SOMETHING'S LEFT -- I GET CALLS REGULARLY ABOUT BACKPACKS LEFT IN WAITING ROOMS AND NORMALLY THAT'S A SIMPLE LOST AND FOUND SITUATION THAT OUR HEALTH CENTERS WE OFTEN HAVE TO CALL IN THE FBI TO COME. AND CLEAR THE PACKAGE -- BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THAT BACKPACK -- IS SO THERE'S A LEVEL OF HIGHER CONCERN OF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS SEEN AS A LIBERAL MECCA IT'S MAKING OUR HEALTH CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND EVEN STRONGER FOCUS. FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO PROVE A POINT -- SO WE ARE SEEING INCREASED A POTESTER ACTIVITY AT OUR HEALTH CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA THEY WANT TO MAKE IT SO OUR PATIENTS CAN'T. OR DON'T WANT TO SPEAK SERVICES AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD SO THAT WE WILL HAVE TO SHUT OUR DOORS. AND JUST LAST WEEK WE HAD A PATIENT COME BACK INTO THE HEALTH CENTER CRYING AT RBC LOCATION IN SACRAMENTO BECAUSE SHE FELT THE PROTESTERS WERE BLOCKING HER FROM GOING TO HER CAR SHE WAS BEING FOLLOWED TO HER CAR. AND TOLD ALL THE REASONS WHY SHE WAS A BAD PERSON FOR COMING FOR SERVICES AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD. AFTER HER VISIT SHE WAS JUST TRYING TO GO HOME. AND SHE CAME BACK IN AND OUR STAFF WALKED HER TO OUR CARS IS THAT SHE WOULD FEEL SAFE BECAUSE SHE HAD TO PARK ON THE STREET ON THAT DAY BECAUSE IT WAS A DAY THAT WE USUALLY DON'T HAVE PROTESTERS. WE ACTUALLY ASK OUR STAFF TO PARK ON THE STREET ON THE DAYS THAT WE HAVE PROTESTERS SO THAT THEY GET TO WALK THROUGH THE PROTESTORS AND OUR PATIENTS DON'T HAVE -- TO BUT THESE ARE THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH ON A REGULAR BASIS -- ONE OF THE OTHER. UNIQUE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IS. INCONSISTENT ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS LOCAL ORDINANCES -- ONE OF OUR HEALTH CENTERS OF HAVING A PROBLEM AND IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA RIGHT NOW. GETTING TRESPASSED AND FORCE BECAUSE THE PROTESTERS WANT TO COME ON THE PROPERTY -- TO PROTEST AND THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SAYS ITS FIRST AMENDMENT WE CANNOT FORCE TRESPASS HERE -- YOU KNOW MOST OF US WOULD SAY THAT'S NOT REALLY. A SITUATION BECAUSE IT'S TRUST PASS IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY'RE SAYING -- BUT THE SELECTIVE INTERPRETATION OF LOCAL LAWS -- AND FOR ME I HAVE THIRTY FIVE HEALTH CENTERS THAT I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR SO I HAVE TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THE CITY AND COUNTY ORDINANCES. FOR THIRTY FIVE LOCATIONS -- AND HOW THEY WILL BE APPLIED AND BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE LAWS IS APPLIED EVENLY AND THESE ARE THINGS THAT ALL OF THE AFFILIATES ARE DEALING WITH IN TERMS OF TRYING JUST. TO TAKE THE POLITICS OUT OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AND JUST MAKE IT ABOUT ENFORCING A SIMPLE NO TRESPASS Là OR A SIGN ORDINANCE Là OR NOISE ORDINANCE Là. OR THINGS LIKE THAT THAT SHOULD BE BLACK AND WHITE BUT BECAUSE OF THE TOPIC OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD ABORTION RIGHTS IT BECOMES AN ISSUE THAT. THE PEOPLE HAVE AN OPINION ON AND THEN THE IT BECOMES QUESTIONABLE ON WHY THEY'RE CHOOSING TO ENFORCE OR NOT CHOOSING TO ENFORCE -- SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS. THAT WE DEAL WITH ON A REGULAR BASIS AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND PROVIDING YOUR INSIGHT -- YOUR TEACHING US A LOT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO HAS A QUESTION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- MISS RUNNING. YES CONSTITUENTS. I DON'T THINK TWENTY SIX HUNDRED BABIES THAT YOUR THAT AYE SIR HEALTH HELP DELIVER THIS PAST YEAR DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE AND AS TO HOW MANY OF THE WOMEN OR ON MEDI CAL OR ON SOME KIND OF ASSISTANCE OR IF YOU COULD JUST SHARED MAYBE SOME OF THOSE. THE STATISTICS I WANT TO GET AN IDEA AS TO INCOME -- AND SOCIAL FOR SHORT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- AND EISNER OF THE TAKEN ACROSS THE BOARD 75% OF OUR PATIENTS ARE BELOW A HUNDRED AND 50% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. SO. BELOW 110050% SO FOR A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL THAT WOULD BE RIGHT AROUND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IN ANNUAL INCOME. MORE OR LESS -- AND WITHIN OTHER DELIVERIES THE VAST MAJORITY ARE COVERED BY MEDICARE ALL -- EITHER THROUGH A MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLAN -- THROUGH A DIRECT MEDI CAL CONTRACT WITH LA CARE OR WITH MEDI CAL PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY -- AND THEN UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE ARE. COVERED BY PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY A SMALL NUMBER OF PATIENTS BECAUSE OF OUR UNIQUE MIDWIFERY MODEL -- A SMALL NUMBER OF OUR PATIENTS ARE COMMERCIALLY INSURED AND CHOOSE -- OUR ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE OF THE MIDWIFERY SERVICE AND BECAUSE OF THE SPECIAL WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE TO THOSE WOMEN THANK YOU. NINE IMAGINE VERY SIMILAR STATISTICS FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD YEAH I FOR THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES IN CALIFORNIA 90% LIVE AT OR BELOW THINK IS ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND A YEAR. WHICH IS AS WE ALL KNOW IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SUSTAIN LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. WITH OUR HUGE HOMELESS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING SITUATION. WHAT IS THE NATIONAL POVERTY RATE? IF YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW I I DON'T KNOW BUT WE CAN GET THAT INFORMATION TO YOU. WE JUST GO I KNOW THAT SINCE I'VE BEEN -- A CEO IN MULTIPLE PLAN PARENTS AND AT DIFFERENT STATES THE VAST MAJORITY OF ALL OF THAT BABIES DELIVERED IN I KNOW IN CALIFORNIA OREGON WASHINGTON AND MONTANA WERE MORE THAN 50% OF THEM WERE THREE MEDICAID. I REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT IS DIVIDED BY A FREEWAY THE ONE TEN FREEWAY. SO ON ONE SIDE OF THE FREEWAY WE HAVE HIGHER INCOME -- HIGHER EDUCATION LEVELS AND ON THE OTHER SIDE WHICH IS PREDOMINATELY EAST LA UNINCORPORATED IT'S 20% BELOW THE NATIONAL POVERTY LINE. AND SO THANK YOU FOR THE SERVICES THAT YOU PROVIDE THE CONSTITUENTS OF EIGHTY FIFTY ONE AND REALLY ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THESE NUMBERS ARE SHOCKING WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR OR TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR AN ANNUAL SALARY AND YOU THINK ABOUT THE INCREASE OF FRIENDS THE INCREASE OF CHILD CARE. THE INCREASE OF FOOD OR TO SUSTAINABILITY IN GENERAL AND FOR THE FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE PLANNING ON HAVING CHILDREN OR IF YOU HAPPEN. TO HAVE A CHILD AND HOW DO YOU JUST LIVE YOUR YOUR LIFE -- AS DISCUSSED IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL. CHOICES ABOUT. CHOICE. BUT ALSO THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO PLAN. THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE HEALTH CENTERS EXPERIENCE -- IN PROVIDING. THIS ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AND HOW WE AS THE LEGISLATURE CAN HELP INCREASES BARRIERS. WHAT WE I THINK -- PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN CALIFORNIA HAS DONE A GREAT JOB OF INTEGRATING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AND DE STIGMATIZING -- ABORTION SO IT'S JUST PART OF YOU KNOW MOST OF OUR CENTERS PROVIDE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IN SOME PROVIDE PRIMARY CARE. AND SO WE'VE REALLY DONE A GREAT JOB WITH THAT OF COURSE FUNDING HAS HELPED SOME OF THE BARRIERS TO CARE THAT OUR PATIENTS HAVE. OF OUR NUMBER ONE REASON FOR NO SHOW FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR CENTRAL VALLEY AREA IS TRANSPORTATION. SO BEING ABLE FOR OUR PATIENTS TO ACCESS SOME FORM OF TRANSPORTATION TO GET TO THEIR HEALTH CENTER IS VITALLY IMPORTANT -- THAT'S I WOULD SAY ONE OF MY NUMBER ONE REASONS AND THEN ALSO HAVING PROVIDERS AT OUR HEALTH CENTERS THE WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND THE REIMBURSEMENT INCREASE HAS REALLY MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. FOR US TO BE ABLE TO HIDE PROVIDE HIGHER PROVIDERS IF YOU DON'T HAVE PROVIDERS YOU CAN'T PROVIDE HEALTH CARE AND PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AREAS WHERE IT'S MUCH MORE CHALLENGING. TO BE ABLE TO HIRE PROVIDERS IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE WE'VE HAD TO DO THINGS TO YOU KNOW INCREASE OUR SALARIES INCREASE OUR BONUS AND RETENTION. BUT IT'S REALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO WORK IN RURAL AREAS IF THEIR PARTNER DOESN'T HAVE A JOB AND IF THEY CAN'T FIND HOUSING. SO THERE'S A VARIETY OF A BARRIERS AND THAT REALLY LIMITS THE CARE THAT'S AVAILABLE IF WE DON'T HAVE A A PROVIDER THAT'S THERE BUT I WOULD SAY. TRANSPORTATION IS OUR NUMBER ONE ISSUE AND GETTING SAFE TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE WE ARE LOOKING AT PARTNERING WITH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE THAT TRANSPORTATION. BUT OF COURSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT IT'S SAFE AND CONFIDENTIAL FOR OUR PATIENTS THAT ARE GOING TO OUR HEALTH CENTERS. CAN I WOULD HAVE TO GO MS CROSSES COMMENTS OF IT THAT'S EXACTLY TRANSPORTATION ISN'T URBAN ISSUE AS WELL -- AND I DON'T HAVE TO TELL MY ASSEMBLY MEMBER PARKING -- AND THE CITY IS A MASSIVE ISSUED AT THE CAN A CASE IN POINT IT SOUNDS TONGUE IN CHEEK BUT A CASE IN POINT. WE WILL AT JUST OUR THREE DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES HEALTH CENTERS IN THE COMING YEAR SPENT OVER A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS IN PARKING FOR OUR PATIENTS -- IN BEEN PARKING SUBSIDIES OF NOT TO MENTION EVEN GOING DOWN THE PATH OF BUS TOKENS AND OTHER TRANSPORTATION. ISSUES ANOTHER WAY THE ASSEMBLY CAN HELP IS CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE AVAILABILITY OF LOAN REPAYMENT -- FOR CLINICIANS WHO ARE COMING ON BOARD AND OTHER STAFF WERE DEDICATING THEIR CAREERS TO A LOW INCOME POPULATION -- PROVIDING THE THE RETENTION OF FONG THAT YOU'VE DONE WITH LOAN REPAYMENT IN THE PAST THAT ALLOWS THE CLINICIANS TO ACCESS THAT. WITH WITH PHYSICIANS AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS MIDWIVES -- DENTISTS IN ALL COMING OUT OF TRAINING WITH A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT COUPLED WITH THE MEDIAN HOUSING PRICE IN LOS ANGELES MEANS THAT WE HAVE A HARD TIME RECRUITING AND RETAINING -- PROVIDERS LONG TERM AND IT'S A IT'S A TREMENDOUS IT'S A TREMENDOUS BARRIER WHEN YOU THINK THAT A PHYSICIAN CAN'T CHOOSE TO WORK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THE FIZZ A PHYSICIAN CANNOT AFFORD TO RENT AN APARTMENT NEAR THE OFFICE. HI I ECHO THAT THE NUMBER ONE REASON I LOSE PROVIDERS IS LOAN REPAYMENT -- AND THAT IS THAT IS HUGE PARTICULAR FOR A MID LEVEL PROVIDERS WE CAN'T BE COMPETITIVE. OUR SOME OF DO YOU SEE THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION RELATED TO THE ISSUES INVESTMENTS GET TALKED ABOUT. RELIGIOUS SAFETY AND SECURITY. CAN YOU SAY THAT AGAIN SO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUE WITH RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF PROVIDERS RELATED. TO FINANCING BUT DOES THE SAFETY AND SECURITY ISSUES THAT YOU'RE CLINICS FACE AS DESCRIBED BY MISSING ASKEY ALSO AFFECT CRIMINAL INTENTION OF PROVIDERS. OR DO NOT SEE A CONNECTION. YEAH GO AHEAD AND THEN ALL AT I KNOW THAT I SPEND A LARGE AMOUNT OF MY TIME ACTING AS A COUNSELOR TO OUR STAFF AND A LOT OF WHAT I DO IS LETTING THEM TALK ABOUT THE THINGS THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH. JUST TO GO TO WORK EVERY DAY -- I HAD ONE OF ONE OF OUR EDUCATORS WITH MAD BECAUSE HE HAS TO ASK. THE THE LARGE NUMBER OF PROTESTERS INSIDE OF THE HEALTH CENTER ARE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE CENTER TO MOVE OUT OF THE WAY JUST TO WALK ON THE SIDEWALK SO HE CAN GET TO HIS JOB EVERY DAY AND THAT WEARS ON AND SO. I I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE COME TO WORK AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD BECAUSE OF THE MISSION AND THAT HELPS TO COUNTERACT. THAT THE FEELING -- BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE. ESPECIALLY SOME OF OUR LOWER LEVEL PROVIDERS ARE HEALTH SERVICE SPECIALIST MEDICAL ASSISTANT LEVEL PEOPLE WHO COME THERE JUST FOR A JOB. A ONE OF PAY THEIR BILLS AND THEY WANT A CAREER AND AND THEY DON'T WANT TO PUT UP. WITH THE STUFF THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH AND THEY WILL GO -- TO A HOSPITAL SETTING AT KAISER SETTING A DOCTOR'S OFFICE SETTING IF THEY'RE NOT. IF IT'S NOT COUNTERACTED BY THE MISSION DR LUCKILY WE HAVE A LOT OF OUR STAFF WHO REALLY WANT TO WORK AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD BECAUSE OF THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE. AND THE PRIDE THAT WE HAVE IN OUR WORK SO IT DOES BALANCE BUT THE I DO KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH HAVING TO WALK THROUGH PEOPLE SCREAMING AT THEM EVERY DAY AND NOT KNOWING WHAT'S COMING NEXT. YEAH WE GO THROUGH EXTRAORDINARY MEANS TO PROTECT OUR STAFF AND OUR PATIENTS AND AND PROTECTING THEIR PERSONAL PRIVACY I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT OUR PROVIDERS PROTECTION AND WE DO WHAT EVER WE CAN. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS PEOPLE CAN SEARCH AND FIND OUT WHERE THEY LIVE. THERE ARE PROVIDERS AND ADMINISTRATORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE HAD PROTESTERS AT THEIR HOUSE EVERY DAY FOR OVER THREE YEARS. FORTUNATELY WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT EXTREME HERE BUT I DO BELIEVE WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR NATION WITH THIS REVOLT AGAINST REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AND FRANKLY. POOR PEOPLE AND WOMEN I'M AFRAID THAT THAT'S GOING TO ELEVATE SO WE REALLY ARE DOING WHATEVER WE CAN. TO PROTECT OUR STAFF THERE ARE AMAZING AND THEY PROVIDE SUCH GREAT CARE TO THE PATIENTS IN FRONT OF THEM SO ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN DO. TO HELP US PROTECT OUR STAFF AND OUR PATIENTS WOULD BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL. SEVERAL STAFF MEMBERS. IT IS THE SECOND HOME PROGRAM -- WHICH IS A STATE RUN PROGRAM THAT IS MEANT TO DEAL. TO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS FOR WOMEN WHO ARE IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATIONS BUT HAS BEEN EXPANDED. TO TO HEALTH. PEOPLE WHO ARE PROVIDE AT HEALTH CARE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE SERVICES OR FEEL THEY'RE UNDER THREAT BECAUSE OF THAT -- BUT IT IS A VERY CHALLENGING PROGRAM TO NAVIGATE -- AND A LOT OF TIMES WHEN WE REACH OUT AND SAY WE WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM THEY'RE LIKE OH THAT'S FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ONLY AND THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THEIR OWN PROGRAM THAT. IT HAS BEEN EXPANDED. TO PROVIDE -- FOR YOU KNOW A PO BOX SOTHAT YOU CAN GET YOUR LEGAL DOCUMENTS THEIR PO BOX INSTEAD OF A HOME ADDRESS WHICH IS HARDER TO TRACK ON THE INTERNET AND THINGS LIKE THAT -- SO -- WE'VE ACTUALLY CREATED SOME AND INFORMATION TO HELP OUR STAFF -- LIKE THE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS THEY MIGHT ENCOUNTER FOR IF THEY WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM AND HELP THEM NAVIGATE HOW TO ENROLL -- BECAUSE THEY CAN BE SUCH A CHALLENGING SITUATION FOR THEM. HOW DOES THAT AS AS A POINT OF -- PERSONAL PRIVILEGE AND DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES AND A HEARING SUCH AS THIS IS THAT THERE'S NO NEED TO SUGAR COAT IT THE FACT IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN BOMB THREATS THERE HAS BEEN OUR CENTER HAS BEEN OPENED FIRE THE PEOPLE A GUNMAN OPENING FIRE AT A PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC. THE DANGER IS NOT ONLY TO THE PATIENTS BUT TO THE STAFF AND THE MENTAL WELL BEING OF STAFF FOR RETIREMENT AND RECRUITMENT TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN CONTINUE TO HAVE THE ADEQUATE BE ADEQUATE -- COUNSELING AND AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY NEED IS A REAL ISSUE. AND SO THESE ARE THINGS THAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE BOLD AND UNAPOLOGETIC ABOUT AND THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. TO TRY TO CIRCUMVENT THE ACTUALITY OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE FACT IS THAT. THERE'S A LOT TO BE A SAID ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND THERE'S A LOT THE CALICO THAT CALIFORNIA CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT THEIR SAFETY -- AT THESE CLINICS AND THAT THE PATIENTS ARE SAFE AND THAT. THE WORKERS ALSO FEEL THAT THEY'RE PROTECTED. THANK YOU ARE STAFF OUR HEROES PROVIDING THIS CARE PROVIDING BASIC HEALTHCARE FOR OUR FAMILIES COMMUNITY SO THANK YOU. YEAH THANK YOU FOR ALL THE DATA PROVIDER PACKED OF HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH CARE CALIFORNIANS. I'M SO WE TAUGHT YOU MENTIONED -- MISTER DEAN. AT SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS AM I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IF THERE ANY OTHER INNOVATIVE PRACTICES. THE ORGANIZATIONS ARE PURSUING TO ADDRESS THE UNMET NEEDS THEY WERE SITTING IN CALIFORNIA. YEAH I THINK IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT THAT WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS WE DO WHATEVER WE CAN WE MEET OUR PATIENTS WHERE THEY ARE AND WE HAVE A VERY DEDICATED. TALENTED CULTURALLY COMPETENT STAFF THAT WORKED REALLY CLOSELY WITH INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY NEED -- ONE ONE EXAMPLE -- WOULD BE -- WE PARTNER WITH A VARIETY OF ORGANIZATIONS AND WITHIN THE DELIVERY CARE THAT WE PROVIDE WE WORK WITH -- ALL COMERS SO IF A WOMAN HAS DECIDED TO HAVE A BABY WE'RE GOING TO PARTNER WITH THE PRENATAL SETTING IN WHICH SHE'S RECEIVED IF SHE'S GOING TO DELIVER UNDER OUR ROOF. SO NOT ALL OF OUR PATIENTS HAVE THEIR PRENATAL WITH US SOME OF THEM HAVE IT WITH OTHER COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AROUND LA AND EVEN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS -- BUT WHAT'S REALLY CLEAR IS THAT WE'RE AND SOME OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS DON'T PROVIDE FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES RIGHT THEY ARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT THAT SIMPLY STAY OUT OF THAT SPACE -- AND BUT WE'RE VERY CLEAR FOR INSTANCE IN OUR AFFILIATION WITH THEM THAT THEIR CLIENTS WILL RECEIVE COMPREHENSIVE FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES AFTER DELIVERY. THAT THEY WILL BE OFFERED A WIDE RANGE OF FAMILY PLANNING OPTIONS WHEN THEY'RE HAVING THEIR THIRTY SIX THIRTY SEVEN WEEK VISITS WITH OBSTETRICIANS AND MIDWIVES. OF BECAUSE THAT STANDARD OF CARE AND THAT EVIDENCE BASE THAT WE FOLLOW WILL NOT VERY -- BECAUSE A PARTNERSHIP THAT WE ENGAGE IN. I THINK THE SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN. BY OUR FANTASTIC OUR REGION HEALTH EDUCATION TEAM TO WORK WITH VARIOUS FOUNDATIONS TO HOLD CLASSES AND PARENTING CLASSES AND THE DADDY BOOT CAMP AND NOW LAUNCHING IN AREAS FOR THE LGBT Q. AYE POPULATION -- WHERE WE HAVE A INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CHOOSING US FOR GENDERLESS EXPERIENCES PART OF THEIR -- AS PART OF THEIR DELIVERY CARE AND EXPANDING THEIR FAMILIES OF ARE ALL TYPES OF INNOVATIONS THAT W HAVE UNDER WAY -- BUT MOST NOTABLY I THINK THE INNOVATION IN THIS SPACE IS PARTIALLY QUITE SIMPLE IT'S GIVING THE PATIENT WITH THE PATIENT IS AFTER -- AND NOT WHAT WE'RE AFTER SO -- IT'S SORT OF THE NEXT LEVEL OF THE THE GOLDEN RULE RIGHT IF THE GOLDEN RULE IS TREATING OTHERS HOW YOU WISH TO BE TREATED THE PLATINUM ROLE IS TREATING PEOPLE HAVE A WISH TO BE TREATED. AND SO THAT'S THE MAXIMUM BY WHICH REALLY WERE LIVING AND HOW WE'RE PROVIDING THIS CARE. SO -- OUR AFFILIATES HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD WITH YOU ALL TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS TELEMEDICINE FOR OUR PATIENTS. AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO USE THAT FOR SO MANY THINGS INCLUDING MEDICATION ABORTIONS -- TRANS HEALTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT WE ALSO SO MUCH INNOVATION HAS COME FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NOW HAVE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS WHAT'S CALLED PP DIRECT AND SO THAT YOU CAN ORDER YOUR PILLS ONLINE AND THAT CAME FROM CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE. SO MUCH INNOVATION OCCUR SO YOU CAN GET YOUR PILLS YOU CAN HAVE AN S. T. I. TEST SENT TO YOUR HOUSE AND THEN WE'LL SEND YOU MEDICATION IS IF YOU NEED IT AND THAT WAS REALLY CREATED. HERE AND IT'S NOW IN ALMOST EVERY STATE IN THE COUNTRY AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. BUT I THINK MEETING PATIENTS WHERE THEY'RE AT AND THAT MEANS IF YOU'RE IN A RURAL AREA BEING ABLE TO USE TELEHEALTH BUT THEY HAVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT. AND OF COURSE WE HAVE TO GET REIMBURSED FOR THAT CARE IN ORDER TO KEEP OUR DOORS OPEN. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND ALL OF THOSE AREAS. YOU FOR YOUR ON GOING WORK -- SO MY LAST QUESTION IS. WHAT ELSE YOU WHAT CAN WE DO -- YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE DO WE TALK A LITTLE ABOUT IT BUT IS THERE ANYTHING LEFT THAT YOU THINK WE CAN DO REGULATORY WITH THE REGULATORY PROCESS FINANCIALLY. THROUGH LEGISLATION TO SUPPORT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ACCESS IN CALIFORNIA [inaudible] BORN WITH. ONE THING YOU CAN KEEP HEARING IS KEEP HAVING THESE HEARINGS AND ELEVATING THIS CONVERSATION IN A WAY -- AND ENGAGING PEOPLE FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF CARE PROVIDERS COMMUNITY ACTIVISTS IN A WAY TO MAKE SURE BY DOING THIS YOU HELP US INTEGRATE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE INTO. WHAT IS JUST HEALTHCARE AND THE D. STIGMATIZATION OF SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IS REALLY A CRITICAL STEP FORWARD -- I THINK WE CAN I THINK YOU CAN DO MORE -- IN THE AREA OF MAKING SURE THAT EVIDENCE BASED SEXUALITY EDUCATION. OF WHAT HAPPENS IN ALL OF OUR OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT THE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTER EXPANSION -- THAT FUNDING FOR THAT WOULD BE CRITICAL MEAN JUST GETTING INTO THAT SETTING WHERE -- PARTICULARLY TEENS ARE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH A LICENSED CLINICIAN AND A TRAINED CLINICIAN -- TO RECEIVE EVIDENCE BASED SERVICES AND A NON JUDGMENTAL AND PRIVATE ENVIRONMENT -- IS. IT JUST IT JUST GOES SO MUCH FURTHER DOWN -- EVEN THE STEPS WE ALWAYS TAKE TO HAVE TEENAGERS SPEAK TO CLINICIANS WITHOUT PARENTS PRESENT ONCE THEY REACH REPRODUCTIVE AGE I MEAN IT'S A AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE AND OF COURSE STABILIZING. THE FUNDING SO WHATEVER YOU WISH TO APPROPRIATE TO EXPAND SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH I THINK WE ALL EXCEPT -- WITHOUT QUESTION. FANTASTIC I I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAID AND REIMBURSEMENT FOR SEX EDUCATION IN ALL THE SETTINGS THAT WE PROVIDE IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND VERY HELPFUL TO STABILIZING. THE FUNDING BUT ALSO THINGS THAT KEEP US UP AT NIGHT -- ARE THINGS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF OUR STAFF AND OUR PATIENTS AND THEN BEING ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO PROVIDERS THROUGH THE LOAN REPAYMENT. AND INCREASED ACCESS FOR THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL BECAUSE SALARIES AND LOAN REPAYMENT ARE WHAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHEN I STARTED I HAD THIRTY FIVE NURSE PRACTITIONER HOPE OPENINGS. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO INCLUDE FILLED MOST OF THOSE POSITIONS BUTWE DID IT THROUGH A MULTIPLE THINGS AND ALSO HAVING A RESOURCE FOR LOAN REPAYMENT WOULD MAKE A HUGE HUGE DIFFERENCE. BECAUSE IF WE HAVE PROVIDERS WERE OUT THERE PROVIDING CARE MEETING OUR PATIENTS WHERE THEY'RE AT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANKS FOR GETTING THIS COMMITTEE TOGETHER BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND WHEN I TALK TO OTHER. PLANNED PARENTHOOD FOLKS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THEY DO SEE CALIFORNIA AS THE BEACON OF LIGHT AND HOPE IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND JOINING US AND PROVIDING ALL THIS FABULOUS INFORMATION MY LIST OF THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IS GROWING WHICH IS WONDERFUL. THANK YOU THANK YOU I AM GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CAREER TO FACILITATE THIS THIRD PANEL RIGHT. EVERYBODY SETTLING IN -- GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN -- THIS IS OUR THIRD PANEL ADDRESSING THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY AND JOINING US TODAY IS LOUD ABOUT I GUESS WHO IS ON THE BOTTOM OF THOUGHT US FROM ABOUT A STAFF. OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD LOS ANGELES. LOUDER HE MENACE WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA THAT THE NEST FOR REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE -- CARMELLA. AT THE END OF OUR CO THE CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION. AND LADY DO A SALAZAR WHO IS A PATIENT ADVOCATE AND I'LL TAKE ANOTHER MOMENT A PRIVILEGE TO INDICATE THAT. MISS HE MENACE WHO IS THE E. D. OF OF CALIFORNIA LOOKING UP. FOR REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE WAS THE SPONSOR OF OUR BILL AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY FOUR WHICH WOULD HAVE. CREATED A COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR FOR STERILIZATION THAT OCCURRED HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO TO OUR IT ON THE STATE'S AGREED GISTS. EUGENICS LAWS THAT IMPACTED LATINO WOMEN AND THOSE THAT WERE INCARCERATED UNFORTUNATELY. THAT BILL WAS HELD IN APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING THE WORK NECESSARY IN FACT. SOUND FROM MY OFFICE IS HERE AND WE HAVE COPIES OF THE FACT SHEET OF THE BILL'S SAM IF YOU WANT TO PASS IT OUT. SO THAT YOU HAVE AN IDEA AS TO WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THAT WAS AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN THE FUTURE. SO WITH THAT SAID I WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO THE PANEL AND LET YOU LADIES GET STARTED ON WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE -- TO DISCUSS I'M NOT SURE WHAT. ORDER BUT WE CAN START WITH. KAMALA WHY DON'T WE START WITH YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO SUCH A CRITICAL ISSUE AND BRING TO THE HEALTH CENTER PERSPECTIVE ON THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. MY NAME'S KAMALA CUSTOMER GARCIA PRESIDENCY OF THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION ALSO KNOWN AS CP CA WHERE THE MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING OVER. THIRTEEN HUNDRED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE PROVIDING COMPREHENSIVE PRIMARY CARE SERVICES TO NEARLY SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT'S ONE IN SIX CALIFORNIANS GETTING THEIR HEALTH CARE AT A COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER. AND CP SAY ALONG WITH OUR AFFILIATE CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLUS ADVOCATES ARE HEAVILY INVESTIGATED INVESTED FUZION ADVOCATING FOR THE RIGHTS OF OUR HEALTH CENTER PATIENTS. INCLUDING IMMIGRANTS TO ENSURE THAT HEALTH CENTERS CONTINUE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE CARE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. I'D LIKE TO JUST GIVE IT A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE HEALTH CENTER PATIENT POPULATION A AND IN PARTICULAR THE MISSION OF THE QUEEN HEALTH CENTERS VERY RELEVANT TO THIS COMMITTEE IN THE QUESTION BECAUSE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS MISSION. IS TO TREAT EVERYONE WHO WALKS THROUGH THEIR DOORS THAT'S REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY THEIR ACCESS TO COVERAGE OR COURSE THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. AND COMMUNITY HEALTH SCANNERS ARE PROVIDING CARE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION WHICH 76% OF OUR PATIENTS BEING AT OR BELOW 20% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. IN OVER 70% BEING FROM COMMITTEES OF COLOR IN FACT 55% OF HEALTH CENTER PATIENTS ARE LIKE THE NOTE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE SERVING OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMELESS AND CLOSE TO SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND MIGRATORY FARMWORKERS SO. BEATING THE NEEDS OF SPECIAL POPULATIONS AND THE RURAL COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA IS VERY CRITICAL ROLE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS ARE PLAYING IN A REAL COMMUNITIES IN FACT COMMITTEE HEALTH AND IT MIGHT BE THE ONLY SOURCE OF CARE. OF EVERYBODY IN THAT COMMUNITY. AND AND JUST TO KEEP IN MIND IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM WE ARE SERVING ONE IN THREE MEDIC HELP PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA THEY'RE GETTING THE CARE AT COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS. SO ASSURING THE FULL SPECTRUM OF SERVICES AND CARE TO THIS POPULATION IS CRITICAL AND THAT'S EVERYTHING FROM MEDICAL DENTAL TO BEHAVIORAL AND REPRODUCTIVE. HEALTH CARE AND ALONG WITH THE NAY BILLING SERVICES SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION DIETARY COUNSELING WICK SERVICES AND ENROLLMENT SUPPORT. SO WE ARE -- VERY PROUD OF THE VERY CRITICAL ROLE WE'RE PLAYING PROVIDING COMPREHENSIVE PRIMARY PREVENTIVE CARE TO A VERY SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF CALIFORNIANS. NOW WHAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS -- VERY CRITICAL NAME SO PLEASE AT A SPECIFIC PANEL ON ACCESS TO IMMIGRANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IS BEING DISCUSSED TODAY AND IT COULDN'T BE. MORE TIMELY A RIGHT NOW GIVEN THE ASSAULT THAT ARE THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY IS UNDER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY -- CERTAINLY THE A NEGATIVE RHETORIC AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS LEAD TO AND AND POLICIES OF LEAD TO INCREASE RATES BY I SAID IT'S BECAUSE THE BEARD DISTRUST ANXIETY AMONG OUR PATIENTS. AND INCLUDING CITIZENS IN INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE IN MIXED STATUS FAMILIES. AND IT'S FURTHER EXACERBATED BY POLICY CHANGES THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN PUSHING INCLUDING CHANGES TO PUBLIC CHARGE FAMILY SEPARATION MISHANDLING OF ASYLUM SEEKERS AND REFUGEES PUTTING REGULAR LET REGULATIONS IN PLACE THAT HINDER THE ABILITY. OF INDIVIDUALS TO MIGRATE TO THIS COUNTRY OR STAY IN PLACE THEY'RE ALREADY HERE AND SPECIFICALLY -- THE PUBLIC CHARGE RULES THAT WERE LEAKED IN -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN HAD LED TO A NUMBER OF OUR HEALTH CENTERS. REPORTING AN INCREASE IN MISTER CAMPBELL'S APPOINTMENTS OR REPORTS OF PATIENTS BEING DIS ENROLLED FROM PROGRAMS I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT A TOUCH ON THIS VERY CRITICAL PENDING FEDERAL POLICY. ON THAT IF -- PUT INTO PLACE WHICH WE DO ANTICIPATE WILL BE A VERY -- VERY SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO INDIVIDUALS ACCESSING HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND WHAT THE PUBLIC CHARGE A DRUG IF I MIGHT JUST BRIEFLY I'M STATE THAT BUT THE PUBLIC CHARGE -- IS IMMIGRATION LAW THAT DETERMINES IT'S IT'S A DEVICE USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER INDIVIDUALS BECOME DEPENDENT ON GOVERNMENT SERVICES WHEN DETERMINING THEIR STATUS IN PARTICULAR HAS TO DO WITH CHANGES FOR ENTRANCE OR RE ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES OR BECOMING A LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS. ACTUALLY PUBLIC CHARGES NOT IT AFFECT INDIVIDUALS BECOMING CITIZENS BUT THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION -- BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT IMPACTS INDIVIDUALS DIFFERENTLY IN A VERY CRITICAL PIECE OF THIS CHANGE TO BE AWARE OF IS AND HOW CARE THEY ARE LOOKING AT USING ACCESS TO SERVICES LIKE MEDICAID. AS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE TAKEN TO CONSIDERATION TO DEEM AN INDIVIDUAL A PUBLIC CHARGE THIS IS VERY CRITICAL WITH LOOKING AT ACCESS TO CARE FOR IMMIGRANTS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE HEALTHCARE IN GENERAL JUST ACCESS TO SOCIAL SERVICES. BECAUSE THIS PENDING PUBLIC POLICY -- JUST AS PUT TREMENDOUS BEER WITH IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THAT'S WHAT THE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO TOUCH ON THIS POLICY AND KNOW THAT -- THIS HAS A BIG IMPACT ON REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES OVER ALL. SO WE REALLY THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS OUR WORK AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE DONE TO EXPAND ACCESS TO CARE ISN'T AN DONE BY THIS. IMMIGRANT ANTI IMMIGRANT ENVIRONMENT AND THESE A PROPOSED POLICIES AND CALIFORNIA HAS WORKED VERY HARD AND IS -- AS A SAID BEACON FOR THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF THE WORK WE ARE DOING TO PROTECT OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND EXPAND STAYS BASE PUBLIC BENEFITS SERVICES THIS IS TREMENDOUS. THIS LEGISLATURE IN OUR GOVERNORS TO BE COMMENDED FOR THE TREMENDOUS WORK IN THAT REGARD HOWEVER. POLICIES LIKE THIS PUBLIC CHARGE RULE TO COME DOWN ANY. DAY WILL ONLY SERVE TO UNDERMINE THESE POLICIES AND CONTINUE TO HAVE A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON IMMIGRANT ACCESS. SO OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY ARE BE MENTALLY AGAINST THIS CHANGE THAT WOULD EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF WHO BECOME A PUBLIC CHARGE AND THE LIST OF PUBLIC BENEFITS THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED. AND THAT DETERMINATION AND THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION AT THE DIRECTION OF OUR MEMBER HEALTH CENTERS HAS BEEN LEADING ADVOCACY EFFORTS PARTICULARLY COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER MOVEMENT AGAINST THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE PUBLIC CHARGE RULE IT'S VERY CRITICAL WE'VE BEEN WORKING BOTH NATIONALLY AND WITH IN CALIFORNIA. TO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL AND TRAINING RESOURCES TO HEALTH CENTERS AND PROVIDERS TO TO PREPARE THEM FOR THE WORST CASE SCENARIO THAT THEY MIGHT ENCOUNTER. IN TERMS OF IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT -- SO WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING FROM HELP OUR STAFF ESTABLISH -- REPORT RISK PLANS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE TRAINED ON IMMIGRATION POLICY I'M WORKING WITH HEALTH CENTERS TO PUT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE REGARDING COOPERATION OR NOT COOPERATING WITH ICE -- AND CERTAINLY BECAUSE OF ICE IS NOT ALLOWED ON OUR SAFE SPACES AND WITHOUT A JUDICIAL WARRANT OR COURT ORDER -- PLAYED A LOT OF ROLE IN HELPING TO EASE THE FEAR AMONG OUR PATIENTS HEALTH CENTER PATIENTS ARE IN TREMENDOUS FEAR ABOUT PARTICIPATING IN PUBLIC BENEFITS -- DUE TO THE ANTI IMMIGRANT CLIMENT SO WE ARE INVOLVED IN THE IMMIGRANT ACCESS TO PUBLIC BENEFITS WORK GROUP AND A PLAYED A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH IMMIGRANT ADVOCATES LIKE THOSE. AROUND THE TABLE TO BETTER INFORM THE COMMUNITY ABOUT THIS RULE AND ULTIMATELY -- SO THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN EVALUATE THE IMPACT ON THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. SO THIS WORK IS VERY CRITICAL OF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR COALITION PARTNERS IN PREPARATION FOR THIS FINAL RULE THE COULD BE RELEASED. ANY DAY -- WE HAVE A STATEWIDE RESPONSE PLAN TO ISSUE MEDIA STATEMENTS IMMEDIATELY TO HELP AND FORMER NETWORKS OF WHERE TO GO TO GATHER RESOURCES. ALSO ENCOURAGING OUR HEALTH CENTERS TO CREATE THEIR OWN RESEARCH PLANS AS WELL AS COORDINATED WITH COUNTY AND WE ARE ARE COURTING THE COUNTIES AND STATE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES. SO IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THE MESSAGING THAT WE DO AROUND THIS. AND MAKE SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE ALSO REFERRED TO OF THE LEGAL RESOURCE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO ALSO EVALUATE THE IMPACT. THIS WILL HAVE ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES. SO THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO DO AHEAD IN THIS ARENA THE I THINK THAT WE'RE JUST. WHEN THIS RULE DROPS WE'RE GOING TO SEE US INCREDIBLE TREMENDOUS FEAR AND IT'S GOING TO HAVE A HUGE BERRY ON ACCESS TO CARE NOT ONLY FOR THE IMMIGRANT POPULATION BUT FOR THE RIVERS POPULATIONS IN LOW INCOME POPULATIONS? CERTAINLY THAT COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS SERVED OTHER PROVIDERS YOU SEE AROUND THIS TABLE. SO I I REALLY WANT TO COMMEND THIS COMMITTEE FOR SHINING LIGHT ON THIS VERY CRITICAL ISSUE AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND CERTAINLY OF THIS LEGISLATURE HAS DONE AND WE KNOW WILL CONTINUE. TO BE LEADERS NOT ONLY IN THE STATE BUT FOR THE COUNTRY AND FOR THAT WE ARE JUST SO IMMENSELY PROUD AND SO MENTALLY GRATEFUL. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS A SANTA GARCIA MISSILES ARE. HI -- MY NAME'S LE LET OURSELVES ARE -- AND UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS -- AND I'M CURRENTLY HERE UNDER DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS -- I I GREW UP IN THE BAY AREA I HAVE CALLED OAKLAND MY HOME SINCE I WAS. FIVE IN TWENTY TWELVE I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A STATUS ADJUSTMENT -- AND I WAS WAITING ON A RESPONSE FROM -- IMMIGRATION AND AND IN EARLY TWENTY THIRTEEN RECEIVED A LETTER WITH THE DEPORTATION DATE -- I WAS TOTALLY NOT PREPARED TO HANDLE THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT LETTER I SENT AN EMAIL TO MY LAWYER AND I WENT ON ABOUT MY DAY TO DAY LIFE -- THE FOLLOWING DAY I HAD AN ANNUAL WELL WOMAN APPOINTMENT AT MY LOCAL PLANNED PARENTHOOD. AND WAS SITTING WAITING FOR THE DOCTOR TO COME IN AND SEE ME -- WHEN THE NURSE CAME IN TO LET ME KNOW THAT THEY WOULD BE UNABLE TO PERFORM MY EXAM BECAUSE I WAS PREGNANT -- I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT I SAID NO PLEASE GO CHECK AGAIN. AND BECAUSE THAT WAS MY PRIMARY HEALTHCARE PROVIDER AT THE TIME THEY'RE LIKE WE KNOW YOUR BIRTH CONTROL WE'VE RAN THE TEST THREE TIMES YOU'RE ACTUALLY PREGNANT -- THE NURSE SAID THEY WOULD GIVE ME TIME TO GET DRESSED AND COME BACK TO TALK TO ME ABOUT MY OPTIONS. THE MINUTE SHE CLOSE THE DOOR -- I BROKE DOWN SOBBING ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT LATER BECAME REAL TO ME -- AND IN WHAT FELT LIKE ETERNITY PROBABLY CLOSE TO FIVE MINUTES ADD TO THINK ABOUT WHAT I WANTED FOR MY LIFE WHAT I WANT FOR MY FUTURE AND WHAT I WANT MY FAMILY TO LOOK LIKE. AND WHAT I KNEW IS THAT I DID NOT WANT TO HAVE A CHILD UNDER THAT DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WHAT I KNEW IS THAT I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE A FAMILY UNDER THE THREAT OF DEPORTATION. AND WHAT I KNEW IS THAT I DID NOT HAVE THE EMOTIONAL CAPACITY TO FIGHT A DEPORTATION CASE AND BE PREGNANT. WHEN A NURSE CAME BACK IN I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITHOUT CONSULTING ANYONE AND TWO DAYS LATER I HAD AN ABORTION? MY ABORTION WAS COMPLETELY ROUTINE UNEVENTFUL ASK ALL ABORTION SHOULD BE -- LIFE IS COMPLICATED ENOUGH ACCESSING YOUR HEALTH CARE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE -- AND THAT WAS THE BEST DECISION THAT I COULD HAVE DONE FOR MYSELF AT THE TIME. I KNOW MY EXPERIENCE IS UNIQUE FOR A LOT OF UNDOCUMENTED -- PEOPLE BECAUSE WHEN I GREW UP HERE I UNDERSTOOD HOW TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE I UNDERSTOOD THAT. EVEN THOUGH I WAS ON DOCUMENTED AN UNEMPLOYED AND UNINSURED I CAN GO TO A LOCAL PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND RECEIVE THE SERVICES THAT I NEEDED. I LIVE IN THE BAY AREA SO I DID NOT HAVE TO EXPERIENCE SERVICE SILOS -- AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THE EXPERIENCE THAT ANY PERSON WHO NEEDS TO ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SHOULD HALF I SHOULD NOT BE THE AN ANOMALY.

EVERY MONTH WE HAVE A CLINIC WITHOUT WALLS WHERE PEOPLE CAN ACCESS ON HEALTH SCREENINGS AT THE SITE. AND WE EITHER FROM A THOUGHT AS OF PROVIDE SPACES TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SEXUAL HEALTH REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. WE ALSO TALK ABOUT FAMILY COMMUNICATION ABOUT SEXUALITY WE TALK ABOUT HOW TO EMBRACE AND CELEBRATE OUR LGBT Q. CHILDREN SO THEY CAN THRIVE. SO THE PROMOTERS REALLY. DISPEL MYTHS ABOUT SEXUALITY THEY TALK ABOUT SEXUAL HEALTH THE NORMAL AYE SCREENINGS WE PROVIDE RESOURCES WE HELP NAVIGATE SYSTEMS WE COMPANY PEOPLE IN GIVEN THE CLIMATE OF FEAR THAT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT -- WE ALSO SEE THAT IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS ADMINISTRATION LIKE THERE WERE LESS AT TEN THEN SEEN OUR CLASSES LIST PEOPLE ATTENDING EVEN AT THE PERRANCE CENTER WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE A VERY SAFE SPACE AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND SCHOOLS IN GENERAL. OR PEOPLE MOTHERS DIDN'T WANT TO PROVIDE -- THEIR NAMES -- ANY INFORMATION OR ACCESS SERVICES -- BUT A PLANNED PARENTHOOD.

TO SEOUL AS THE PROMOTE THOUGHT I'M MODEL HAS A LOT OF IMPACT IN I DECREASING HELD -- DISPARITIES IS A CULTURALLY SENSITIVE. UP FROM ABOUT US LIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY ARE INVESTED IN THE COMMUNITIES. AND THEY ARE GREAT ASSETS A IN A MEMBER PRODUCTIVE HEALTH THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS ARGUS MISS HUMANNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON -- I'M NOT A HE MENACE AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA LETTING US FOR REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE OR CLR J. -- I WAS ALSO BROUGHT UP IN THE REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE MOVEMENTS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND I'VE BEEN A PROUD -- REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE ADVOCATE SINCE THAT TIME -- SEALER J. THE STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION COMMITTED TO HONORING THE EXPERIENCES OF LATINOS AND THAT THE NEXT PERSON'S TO UPHOLD OUR DIGNITY OUR BODIES ARE SEXUALITY IN OUR FAMILIES. WE BUILD THAT THE N. AS IN THAT THE NEXT POWER AND CULTIVATE LEADERSHIP THROUGH COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT POLICY ADVOCACY AND COMMUNITY INFORMED RESARCH TO ACHIEVE REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE -- WE ARE CURRENTLY THE ONLY LATINA LED REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE ORGANIZATION IN CALIFORNIA HOLISTICALLY ADDRESSING LATINOS AND AT THE NEXT HEALTH AND WELL BEING. FOR THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS WE HAVE SERVED AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN PUBLIC POLICY AND THE SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION LATINOS IN CALIFORNIA WHO REPRESENT. 19% OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION AND COMPRISE OVER 39% OVER THE THIRD OF THE STATE'S FEMALE POPULATION -- BASED ON US OUR PRODUCTION STATE THE BY TWENTY SIXTY LATINOS WILL REPRESENT NEARLY HALF OF THE FEMALE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA AND A THIRD OF THE FEMALE POPULATION OF THE U. S.. BASED ON THESE PROJECTIONS IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE HEALTH AND PROSPERITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION IS VERY MUCH LINKED TO THE OVERALL WELL BEING OF LATINOS AND THEIR FAMILIES. WE UTILIZE THE REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE FRAMEWORK WHICH IS CREATED BY WOMEN OF COLOR BASED ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK AND BLACK FEMINIST THEORY TO CENTER THE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN. OUR COMMUNITIES. WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO ENSURE THAT ALL PEOPLE'S NEEDS ARE MET. ADDRESSING THE ISSUES OF IMMIGRANTS IN REGARDS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH REQUIRES US TO UTILIZE THIS FRAMEWORK TO GET A HOLISTIC PICTURE. OF THESE COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND THE WAYS THAT THEY ARE INTERSECTING ISSUES THAT THEY EXPERIENCE SIMULTANEOUSLY. IMMIGRANTS ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR NATIONAL FABRIC AND PART OF EVERY COMMUNITY THERE ARE CO WORKERS OR CLASSMATES. OUR NEIGHBORS ARE LEGISLATORS. ALMOST EVERY FAMILY HAS A MIGRATION STORY. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO MORE IMMIGRANTS ANY OTHER ANY OTHER STATE. OVER A QUARTER OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION IS FOREIGN BORN ABOUT TWICE THE U. S. PERCENTAGE AND A LITTLE OVER HALF OF THOSE TEN MILLION IMMIGRANTS ARE LETTING US -- ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES FROM IMMIGRATION POLICY INSTITUTE MORE THAN FOUR MILLION CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA HAVE AT LEAST ONE IMMIGRANT PARENT. AND THE VAST MAJORITYOF THESE CHILDREN ARE US CITIZENS. A REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE APPROACH TO THE ISSUE OF A MAKE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH REQUIRES THAT WE CONSIDER THE THREE TENANTS OF THE FRAMEWORK. THE RIGHT TO CONTROL OUR FERTILITY AND HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE CONTRACEPTIVE AND ABORTION SERVICES ON DEMAND. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT COMPREHENSIVE SEX THAT IS AVAILABLE TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN SCHOOLS. THE RIGHT TO DECIDE TO HAVE CHILDREN WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM THE STATE OR OTHER INSTITUTIONS. AND THE RIGHT TO RAISE THE CHILDREN WE HAVE AND SAFE AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT. REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE SEE JUSTICE IS THE LEGACY OF THE STRUGGLE OF BLACK INDIGENOUS AND OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR AGAINST GENOCIDE SLAVERY FORCED BREEDING FOR STERILIZATION STOLEN CHILDREN AND RACIST IMMIGRATION AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICIES AMONG OTHER THINGS. SO BASICALLY WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE CONCRETE RESULTS THAT WE ARE LIVING WITH FROM A SYSTEM BUILT UPON NOT ONLY MISOGYNY BUT RACISM AND WHITE SUPREMACY. TODAY IN CALIFORNIA THAT MEANS UNDERSTANDING THAT ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA IS PAINTED AS A BEACON FOR REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM IN THE COUNTRY. NOT EVERYONE HAS EQUAL ACCESS TO SERVICES. LANGUAGE IS STILL A BARRIER AS WE HERE IN LOS ANGELES OFTEN THERE ARE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE COMING FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA WHO ARE NOT SPEAKING SPANISH. AND THE LANGUAGE BARRIER -- OFTEN RESULTS IN CHILDREN BEING REMOVED AND INADEQUATE ACCESS TO SERVICES COURT PROCEEDINGS ETCETERA. INCOME IS STILL A BARRIER NOT EVERYONE HAS HEALTH INSURANCE GEOGRAPHY IS SUPERIOR WHEN THEY'RE NOT SERVICES WITHIN A REASONABLE -- RANGE FROM YOUR HOME. AND NOT TO MENTION THE CLIMATE OF FEAR AND CONFUSION THAT THE FEDERAL MINISTRATIONS REGULATIONS AND POLICIES IS GENERATING AN IMMIGRANT AND OTHER COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. THE ATTEMPT TO ENTITLE TEN FUNDING IT TO CHANGE THE PUBLIC CHARGE RULE AS WELL AS THE CURRENT POLICY OF SEPARATING IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE CHILDREN. FROM THEIR FAMILIES AT THE BORDER AND KEEPING THEM IN TORTUROUS CONDITIONS HEIGHTENED STRESS AMONGST IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND OTHERS. RESULTING IN MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH CRISES. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS CENTER THE NEEDS AND EXPERIENCES OF THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR IN OUR STATE -- AND CREATE PRACTICAL ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES -- I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT -- WHAT A GREAT JOB ADVOCATES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE DONE OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES IN TERMS OF MAKING GREAT STRIDES IN INCREASING ACCESS IN THE STATE? BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO REALIZE THAT DOESN'T EQUATE TO PRACTICAL ACCESS AND ALL COMMUNITIES -- ESPECIALLY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES OR UNDER REPRESENTED AND MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES -- ADDRESS RACISM AND WHITE SUPREMACY THROUGH LEGISLATION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE -- ADDRESSING THE HISTORICAL WRONGS PERPETRATED AGAINST PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA IS CRITICAL AND CONTINUE TO WORK OUT WAYS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES FROM FEDERAL TAX AND TO EDUCATE AND INFORM THEM ABOUT THESE EFFORTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO BE HERE TODAY. THANK YOU -- THANK YOU FOR THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION CERTAINLY THAT NEEDS TO BE SHARED ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. THAT'S BECAUSE THE AND I WANT TO GO BACK TO YOU -- FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE A PUBLIC CHARGE AND THE WAY THAT -- SOME CLINICS ARE BEING IMPACTED AND WHAT YOU'RE SEEING ON YOUR END -- THAT YOU MAY NEED HELP ON FROM THE LEGISLATURE -- WELL WE ACTUALLY. DID A SOME DATA TO LOOK AT THE CHILLING EFFECT THAT WAS HAPPENING ON OUR FAMILIES IN A STUDY WITH THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP IN THAT CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA PROGRAM ASK SAYS TO CARE WHILE BACK TO IT WAS ACTUALLY PROVIDER SURVEY JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT PROVIDERS REPORTED AMONG IMMIGRANT FAMILIES WE SAW 90% INCREASE IN ANXIETY AND FEAR DUE TO DETENTION AND DEPORTATION. SYMPTOMS A 50% INCREASE AND EXCITING AND DEPRESSION DIAGNOSIS 25% INCREASE IN SINKING MENTAL HEALTH CARE -- ENROLLING IN PUBLIC BENEFIT PROGRAMS SUCH AS WEAK AND MEDICAID AND SO -- AND THIS INCLUDES WITH THE CAN FEW I'M REALLY MASS CONFUSION OF PEOPLE COMING IN WITH THE FEAR CAUSING THEM TO WANT TO CANCEL APPOINTMENTS ARE ASKED TO BE JUST ENROLLED IN PROGRAMS LIKE. MEDICARE SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DOCUMENT FROM OUR A PROVIDERS AND THIS. ACTUALLY DOES PRESENT STRESS ON PROVIDERS -- BECAUSE THE PROVIDERS ARE ARE ALREADY -- CHARLIE YOU KNOW HAVES DRESS A CHALLENGING POPULATION IN OUR CHALLENGE WE GETTING THEM ACCESS TO SPECIALTY CARE AND OTHER SERVICES OVER CAPACITY IT'S ALREADY A CHALLENGING POSITION TO WORK WITH THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. BUT WHAT WE FOUND IN TALKING TO OUR PROVIDERS ARE RESPONDING TO THE SURVEY WHEN THE POPULATION IS PARTICULARLY STRESSED AT THIS LEVEL AND YOU AND FOR EXAMPLE OR MENTAL HEALTH CAPACITY CANNOT KEEP UP WITH THE DEMAND -- THIS PUTS A TREMENDOUS STRESS ON PROVIDERS SO THAT'S JUST AN ADDITIONAL THING THAT WE ARE SEEING IS ALREADY DISCUSSED THE WORK FORCE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE TO RECRUIT RETRAITE READ RETAIN OUR PROVIDERS AND I JUST KNOW WHEN OUR PATIENTS ARE SUFFERING -- THE PROVIDERS WHO ARE SO DEDICATED AND COMMITTED TO THEM ARE SUFFERING AS WELL. HAVE YOU -- CAN YOU SHARE MAY BE ANYONE ON THE PANEL -- THE PERSONAL STORY OF THE PUBLIC CHARGE -- SITUATION AND HOW IT IMPACTED FAMILIES OR WHAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM. FROM THE CLINICS ON THE GROUND. I'M WELL I THINK DEFINITELY THE FEAR AMONG CHILDREN IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO HEARTBREAKING AND IT WAS IT WAS DISCUSSES STATISTICS ABOUT OUR CHILDREN THAT ARE IN AT PARENTS THAT ARE WHAT LEAST WHEN IMMIGRANTS VERY PROMINENT IN OUR POPULATION. I'M SO THERE'S A LOT OF FEAR AMONG CHILDREN AND THAT IS SOMETHING WE'RE HEARING -- BOTH ANECDOTALLY AND ON AND I THINK OUR SURVEY HELP TO SUPPORT THAT IDEA SO THAT IS I THINK JUST A MAJOR A MAJOR CONCERN -- AND WHEN I JUST SAY ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS NOT BEING ABLE TO DRESS THEM I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO GET TO POLICY BUT THAT IS CERTAINLY A FRUSTRATION WITHIN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS THAT. A WELL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SOMETHING WERE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE -- UNDER FEDERAL LAW THAT THERE ARE POLICIES IN PLACE THAT ARE IMPACTING OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO IN THESE SITUATIONS WITH THERE'S JUST A GROWING TREMENDOUS NEED AND YET. YEARS GETTING IN THE WAY IT'S EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING. CAN I ASK OF THEIR OTHER POLICIES THE YOU SEE THAT HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT IN ADDITION TO THE PUBLIC CHARGE ROLE WHETHER COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR OTHERWISE THAT ARE REALLY. BETTER CREATING BARRIERS TO PEOPLE ACCESSING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH TREATMENT. WELL THE HOSTILITY TO THE IMMIGRANT POPULATION THAT THAT'S BEEN MENTIONED EVERYTHING FROM THE SAME FAMILY SEPARATIONS AND THE ANTI IMMIGRANT CLIMATE THE PUBLIC CHARGES JUST ANOTHER LAYER ON TOP OF A MULTI YEAR ASSAULT THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE. SO I THINK IT'S REALLY ALL THESE POLICIES AND THAT'S ALSO PART OF THE CONFUSION AND WHY THERE'S THE DEED FOR EDUCATION AS WELL BECAUSE THESE POLICIES ARE VERY CONFUSING TO INDIVIDUALS. RIGHT -- SO WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ARE LASTING ABOUT TRANSPORTATION BEING -- AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF MAKING SURE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE ARE THERE OTHER THINGS THAT WE CAN DO -- TO CREATE BETTER ACCESS -- BEYOND. BEING PARTNERS IN EDUCATING INFORMING ABOUT THE REALITY OF THINGS IN PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION AND SOME OF THE THINGS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT YOUR ANY THOUGHTS FOR US AND HOW WE CAN SUPPORT YOU AND DECREASING THOSE BARRIERS. ONE OF THE I DO WANT TO MENTION THE MENTAL HEALTH CARE IS BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS SO HUGE WE'RE FACING A CRISIS OF INDIVIDUALS NEEDING ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH BUT THE MAJOR PROVIDER CONSTITUENCY IN THE STATE WHICH COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS THAT ARE WELL POSITIONED TO PROVIDE. THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND DOING IT THE WAY THE INTEGRATED INTO PRIMARY CARE WHICH EVIDENCE SHOWS IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH. BUT STATE POLICIES RIGHT NOW DO NOT FACILITATE THE ABILITY OF COMMITTEE HEALTH CENTERS TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE STILL NOT ABLE TO BILL FOR MARRIAGE FAMILY THERAPIST THIS IS THE MOST CULTURALLY COMPETENT DIVERSE WORKFORCE IN MENTAL HEALTH THAT EXISTS AS MARRIAGE FAMILY THERAPIST. WE ARE THE ONLY PROVIDER GROUP THAT IS UNABLE TO BILL FOR THEM. THAT IS A TRAGEDY IN STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THIS SITUATION AND AND THE NEED FOR BILINGUAL BICULTURAL PROVIDERS THAT'S A POLICY THE COULD BE CHANGE WITH THE STATE PLAN AMENDMENT THAT THE STATE -- NEEDS TO SUBMIT SO WE CAN MOVE ON THAT SO THAT'S JUST A VERY CRITICAL POLICY ANOTHER IS THE ABILITY TO BILL FOR MENTAL HEALTH IN A PRIMARY CARE VISIT ON THE SAME DAY. I WENT TO A CLINIC IN NAPA THIS IS A VERY LARGE FARM WORKER POPULATION A BRAND NEW CLINICS SLATED TO OPEN JUNE FIRST I WENT AT THE I WHEN AT THE END OF MAY. THEY HAD IT ALL SET UP WHERE THE PRIMARY CARE. OF THE THE MENTAL HEALTH ROOM WAS INTEGRATED INTO THE PRIMARY CARE A CLINICAL. SPACE HOWEVER THE CLINIC CANNOT BE REIMBURSED IF THEY IDENTIFY DEPRESSION BEHIND EGGS IDEA EVERYTHING THAT WAS MENTIONED. AND WANT TO JUST HAND OFF TO A WARM HAND OFF SAME DAY HAVE THAT FAMILY THAT CHILD BE SEEN BY MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER WE CANNOT. BILL FOR THAT SERVICE IF WE DO IT ON THE SAME DAY EVEN THOUGH KNOWING THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO FACILITATE ACCESS. SO LIKE I SAID THERE'S A MAJOR BARRIERS AND IF THESE BEARS WERE ELIMINATED IT WOULD GREATLY ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS WHO ARE THE RIGHT. PROVIDER TO SERVE THIS POPULATION IN THE RIGHT WAY -- AND WE'D BE ABLE TO DO MORE TO ADDRESSTHESE TREMENDOUS NEEDS ARE THE MENTAL HEALTH PIECE REALLY DOES NEED TO BE MENTIONED -- IN THIS CURRENT ENVIRONMENT CRITICAL BARRIER SUPER HELPFUL THANK YOU. I WANTED TO ASK A QUESTION ON CULTURAL COMPETENCY. SO -- LET THE ENOUGH FAMILIES AT THE NO FAMILIES TEND TO BE SOMETIMES MORE CONSERVATIVE -- AND I'M WONDERING FROM THE PROMOTE THOUGHT UP PERSPECTIVE WHAT HAS BEEN THE GROWTH. OF MORE LATINA MOTHERS GETTING ENGAGED HOSPITAL THOUGHT AS AN ACTUALLY ADVOCATING FOR COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. AND I'M SURE IT SEALED YOU CAN ALL MISSING AS HE CAN ALSO ATTEST TO THAT AS WELL. WELL OUR PROGRAM HAS WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE IN WHAT WE SEE IS THAT DESPITE THE BELIEF THAT. WE ARE VERY CONSERVATIVE WHICH WE ARE BUT WE ARE ALSO. VERY CONCERNED ABOUT OUR FAMILY AND THE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN. AND THE MOMENT YOU KNOW WE STARTED OUR CLASSES IN THE APARTMENT BUILDINGS WITH THE WITH THE MOMS IN A LIVE. AND SO THE MOMENT WE TALK ABOUT -- STD RATE AMONG THE YOU'LL SEE OF NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES -- THE PARENTS ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CHILDREN SO THEY THEY ARE VERY WILLING. TO TO AVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND THEN THEY SEE IN THE PROMO TORA A LEADER A MODEL AND THEY GET VERY EXCITED WE PROVIDE -- EIGHT TO TWELVE SESSIONS ABOUT ALL SORTS OF THINGS YOU KNOW YOUR BODY CONTRACEPTIVES A COMMUNICATION ABOUT SEXUALITY ACCEPTING YOUR LGBT CHILDHOOD TO THAT SOUL WE BUILD TRUST AND PARENTS ARE VERY OPEN LATINO PARENTS ARE VERY OPEN THEY WANT THE BEST FOR THEIR CHILDREN. AND A LOT OF WOMEN APPROACH THE PROMOTER AND SAY I WANT TO BE A PROMOTE THOUGHT I WANT TO DO WHAT YOU DO SO.-A THE WILLINGNESS THE OPENNESS IS THERE. A I WOULD SAY A WE USED. TO IN THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE NINETY TWO IN EAST LA A PEN PAL USED TO KNOCK ON DOORS AND SAY YOU DO WANT TO BE AT PROMOTING COMMON TWENTY GET TRAINED. AND THE PROMOTED AS LITTLE BY LITTLE STARTED FROM. TEACHING AT AN APARTMENT BUILDINGS TO CALL TO THE PEN SENSE I WANT TO GO TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WITH MY CHILD CLOSE I WANT TO GO TO THE MIDDLE SCHOOL AT TODAY. NOWADAYS EVERY YEAR PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLOSE TO A HUNDRED AND FORTY SCHOOLS IN THE US THE SOLE -- IN ALSO WE HAVE A WAITING LIST FOR WOMEN IN THE COMMUNITY WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE A PROMO TORA AND THEY KNOW THAT IS HAS TO DO WITH SEXUAL HEALTH WHICH IS. ALMOST DOUBLE IN OUR CULTURE SO WE SEE THOSE CHANGES AT THAT LEVEL OF THE FAMILY LEVEL AND THE IMPACT THAT THE PROMOTE THOUGHT I HASH. ON THEIR CUSSONS THE COMMODITIES THAT THERE. I IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT -- THEY IMPACT THAT THEY HAVE. WE SEE IT AS A RIPPLE EFFECT REALLY AND THEY ARE EXCITED ABOUT THESE THINGS. AND ALSO THE HUSBANDS OR PARTNERS YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THERE'S RESISTANCE AT THE BEGINNING WHERE YOU. YOU KNOW BRING IN THESE MATERIALS HEAD A HANDING OVER CONDOMS OR HAVING THIS AND THAT'LL ME PEACE YOU KNOW LIKE. BUT THE HUSBANDS AND PARTNERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS ALSO WARM UP TO THE IDEA THEY SEE THE VALUE OF THESE. INFORMATION THE SHERRY IN AND THEY SEE THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF OF THESE KINDS OF OF PROGRAMS. I I WOULD AGREE WITH WHAT WAS BETTER SAYS -- BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- WELL WE DO HAVE -- FAMILIES THAT ARE VERY CONSERVATIVE IN OUR IN OUR COMMUNITIES I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALSO COMPLICATE THAT THAT SORT OF STEREOTYPE OF WHO WE ARE BECAUSE WE ARE NOT ALL THAT CONSERVATIVE IN FACT YOU KNOW STUDIES SHOW THAT LATINO PARENTS WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO HAVE COME SIX THAT EQUAL. YOU KNOW OR SIMILAR RATES TO OTHER COMMUNITIES -- AND THAT -- OFTENTIMES RELIGION IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT FACT DECIDING FACTOR IN MAKING DECISIONS AROUND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OR THEIR REPRODUCTIVE LIFE. AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO PUT THAT FORWARD HERE IN THIS BUILDING IN THE MEDIA IN OUR COMMUNITIES IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S JUST LACK OF INFORMATION AND WANTING AND NOT. FEELING CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO SHARE THE INFORMATION WITH THEIR CHILDREN BUT WHEN I YOU KNOW PROMOTE OTIS ARE ARE SHARING INFORMATION AND TRAINING PARENTS -- THEN THEY CAN THEY CAN GAIN THAT THAT CONFIDENCE AND THEY CAN SPEAK WITH THEIR KIDS AND THEY'RE ALSO INTERESTED IN THEIR CHILDREN HAVING THAT EDUCATION AT SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY WANT THEIR KIDSTO BE SAFE WE WANT OUR KIDS TO BE SAFE. I WOULD LIKE TO CALL ON SOMEBODY FROM THE AUDIENCE THAT'S OKAY. MRS CELINDA VASQUEZ'S WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD LOS ANGELES AND WE WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT -- SCHOOL BASED HEALTH.

PRIMETIME -- THEY HAD ABOUT THIS IS ANECDOTAL THEY HAD ABOUT THIRTY POSITIVE PREGNANCY TEST THAT THEY KNEW OF AND THEY THEY ASK PLANNED PARENTHOOD TO COME IN AND TO DO YOU WORK AT THE SCHOOL SO. WE DID THAT -- AND THE MODEL HAS EVOLVED TREMENDOUSLY SINCE THE SINCE THAT FIRST YEAR BUT THE FOLLOWING YEAR THEY ONLY HAD THREE POSITIVE PREGNANCY TEST SO WE KNOW THOSE ARE THE THE THE NUMBERS THAT WERE.
