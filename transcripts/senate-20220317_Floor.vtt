BE OBVIOUS TO ALL OF US. AND IF

00:08:56.802 --> 00:09:00.673
WE DO NOT HAVE. FIFTY OR SIXTY

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.909

THREE YEARS THIRTY FIVE YEARS

00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:31.137
LATER THE VALUE OF WOMEN IS

00:09:31.203 --> 00:09:33.172
STILL OVERLOOKED WOMEN ARE STILL

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:36.008
PAID LESS THAN MEN. EIGHTY THREE

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:37.610

00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:12.111
BASIS OF SEX. NOW THE

00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:14.146
CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THE THIRTY

00:10:14.213 --> 00:10:16.649

00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:35.468
IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT PUTS A

00:10:35.534 --> 00:10:37.737
DEADLINE ON THE RATIFICATION OF

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:39.505
