ITEM FOR THREE A LITTLE OUT OF ORDER TO SENATOR MINING CENTER MORNING ARE YOU PREPARED. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL NINE SEVENTY SEVEN BY SENATOR MINING AN ACT RELATED TO HEALTH FACILITIES SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE OP APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL NINE SEVEN SEVEN. MEMBERS THIS IS A BILL DESIGNED TO PROTECT PATIENTS OUR CONSTITUENTS THIS YEAR A COVER CALIFORNIA BRONZE PLAN FOR A FORTY YEAR OLD COST FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR DOLLARS IN EUREKA. FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN SACRAMENTO. AND IN LOS ANGELES. THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN DOLLARS THIS BILL AIMS TO ADDRESS THAT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR DIFFERENCE IN PRICES BETWEEN REGIONS WHY ARE THESE DIFFERENCES LET ME EXPLAIN FOR TOO LONG STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT HOSPITAL CONSOLIDATIONS RESULT IN INCREASED PREMIUMS FOR CALIFORNIANS AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE. THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR AS REPORTED BY THE LA TIMES THE NEW YORK TIMES AND IT'S PRESENTED IN ACADEMIC JOURNALS WE KNOW THE PROBLEM EXISTS. THIS ARE. SERVICES ARE GOING DOWN EXISTING LAW PROVIDES A LITTLE OVERSIGHT OF HEALTH CARE SYSTEM CONSOLIDATION AND MARKET PRACTICES LEFT UNCHECKED HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AND UTILIZE ABUSE OF MARKET PRACTICES THAT DRIVE UP PRICES AND REDUCE ACCESS FOR CONSUMERS. SENATE BILL NINE SEVEN SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE LARGE HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AS WELL AS PRIVATE EQUITY GROUPS IN HEDGE FUNDS TO OBTAIN APPROVAL FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BEFORE AN AFFILIATION OR ACQUISITION WITH ANY OTHER HEALTH CARE FACILITY OR PROVIDER. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD EVALUATE THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION BASED ON TWO FACTORS WHETHER THE TRANSACTION WILL INCREASE CARE COORDINATION OR INCREASE AFFORDABILITY OF CARE TO AN UNDERSERVED POPULATION. AND SECOND WHETHER THE TRANSACTION IS SUBSTANTIALLY LIKELY TO RESULT IN ANTI COMPETITIVE EFFECTS OUTWEIGH ANY BENEFITS. IF THE ACQUISITION OR AFFILIATION DOES NOT MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MADE THE NIGHT THE TRANSACTION WERE PROPOSED TERMS OR CONDITIONS TO THE DEAL. SENATE BILL NINE SEVEN SEVEN DOES NOT SEEK TO DENY OR BLOCK TRANSACTIONS IT IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT PATIENTS AND CONSUMERS OUR CONSTITUENTS. THIS BILL INSURERS OF HEALTH CARE SYSTEM GROWS IT MUST INCREASE IT SERVICES NOT JUST ITS PROFITS. IF GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY I'M COMMITTED TO AMEND THE BILL TO CLARIFY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S REVIEW PROCESS AND TO ENSURE THE CREATION OF A ROBUST ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD. I WILL THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TO MEAN ENTITIES ARE SYSTEMS THAT INCLUDES THREE OR MORE HOSPITALS OF WHICH AT LEAST ONE IS A GENERAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL. THIS WILL BE THE FOCUS OF REVIEW. ADDITIONALLY SB NINE SEVEN SEVEN WOULD DECLARE THAT HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS THE EXERCISE SUBSTANTIAL MARKET POWER MAY NOT ENGAGE IN BEHAVIOR THAT HAS A SIGNIFICANT LIKELIHOOD OF ANTI COMPETITIVE PRACTICES. E. G. RAISING PRICES BECAUSE THERE'S NO COMPETITION. AND I COMPETITIVE BEHAVIORS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE INCREASING MARKET PRICES DIMINISHING QUALITY REDUCING CHOICE INCREASING THE TOTAL COST OF CARE. IN DIMINISHING ACCESS FOR AVAILABILITY OF HOSPITAL OR NON HOSPITAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES FINALLY SB NINE SEVEN SEVEN ESTABLISHES A HEALTH POLICY ADVISORY BOARD. THE BOARD WOULD BE MADE UP. A BROAD CROSS SECTION OF STAKEHOLDERS WOULD ADVISE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROPOSED CONSOLIDATION TRANSACTION IN BASED ON AMENDMENTS THAT CAME OUT OF APPROPRIATIONS THOSE WHO MEMBERS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REPORT ANY POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN FINAL FORM SEVEN HUNDRED IN THE ONLY. AS THE WORLD RESPONDS TO THE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE IS MORE CRITICAL THAN EVER BEFORE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME COVERT NINETEEN HAS CREATED ENORMOUS FINANCIAL STRAIN ON BOTH HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS MAKING THESE PROVIDERS SUSCEPTIBLE TO CONSOLIDATION EFFORTS BY LARGE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS IN PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS THAT DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE ANY PRACTICE IN THE PROVISION MEDICAL CARE. IT'S SECOND I'M A CRISIS THAT CREATES AN IMMEDIATE NECESSITY TO GIVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE SAME AUTHORITY OVER PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS CITY CURRENTLY HAS OVER A TRANSACTION INVOLVING A NONPROFIT ENTITY. SO IN ESSENCE THIS BILL SEEKS PARITY THAT THE SCRUTINY WE ALREADY APPLY TO NON PROFIT WE SHOULD ALSO APPLY THAT SCRUTINY TO FOR PROFIT TRANSACTIONS. FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING PATIENTS OUR CONSTITUENTS IN A MARKET PLACE THAT WE DON'T SEEK TO STIFLE. WE SEEK TO REVIEW AND PROTECT. THE GOAL OF PATIENT ACCESS PATIENT CARE. AND BLOCKING ANTI COMPETITIVE PRICING MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU CENTER MONNING MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE SENATOR BORCHERS. THE MAN PRESIDENT PHILOSOPHICALLY I WOULD NORMALLY BE INCLINED TO PROMOTE- COMPETITION AND BE CONCERNED ABOUT ANTI TRUST DEVELOPMENTS- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT HERE IS THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC- WE NOT CREATE A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE CREATING MORE OBSTACLES- IN THE WAKE OF. THE NEED FOR- MORE MEDICAL SERVICES IN PARTICULAR I THINK ONE THE COMMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR MENTION IS THAT THE NONPROFIT IS SOLD AT A CERTAIN LEVEL OF SCRUTINY THAT WOULD THEN BE APPLIED TO A PRIVATE ENTITY. THAT I THINK COULD BE PROBLEMATIC- BECAUSE ONE YOU HAVE THE FREEDOM OF CONTRACT AND THE FREEDOM TO ENGAGE WITH ENTITIES WHETHER BEING A PROFIT SETTING- OR SOME OTHER FIVE COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE SO CONCERNS ME THAT WE'RE TAKING THE PUBLIC SCRUTINY. THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE RESERVED FOR ENTITIES THAT RECEIVE A TAX BENEFIT AND THE NONPROFIT RECEIVED BENEFITS BY VIRTUE OF CLASSIFICATION INTO A PRIVATE SITUATION THAT TYPICALLY DOESN'T. SO IN A COLD SITUATION MY CONCERN IS THAT DELAYING THROUGH IN AG REVIEW PROCESS. IN AFFILIATION WHEREBY A LARGER- MEDICAL AND EIGHTEEN COULDN'T USE CASH INTO A SMALL FOR MEDICAL FACILITY AT THE MOMENT OF DESPERATION ESPECIALLY AS WE- THE EXISTING RIGHT NOW I THINK IT COULD HAVE. SOME WILDLY INTENDED CONSEQUENCES EVEN THOUGH I BELIEVE THE PART OF THE BILL IS TO PROMOTE GREATER ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE BUT IN A CULVERT SCENARIO I THINK CREATING THAT BUREAUCRATIC IN ADMINISTRATIVE. THE WORK THAT OFFICE IN MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THIS SHOULD BE BROUGHT BACK ONCE OUR FINANCES AND OR PUBLIC SAFETY MEASURES- AND SITUATION HAVE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE PANDEMIC IS ADDRESSED AND RESOLVED HOPEFULLY. THANK YOU CENTER BORDERS SENATOR ALAN. LET ME START BY COMMENDING THE AUTHOR FOR YOU KNOW GETTING INTO A AN IMPORTANT AND DIFFICULT ISSUE INVOLVING. THE CONSOLIDATION OF OUR HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY AND THE EXTENT T WHICH- YOU NOW HAVE DIFFERENT ENTITIES ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE STEPPING IN I'VE HAS FUNDS IN THE REST. AND ENGAGING IN TAKING OVER MANY ASPECTS OF OUR OF OUR HEALTH CARE INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO- I AM- I'VE HAD SOME VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH MY GOOD COLLEAGUE- CENTER MINING IN THE IN THE IN THE RUN UP TO THIS BILL OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A CONCERN OUT THERE. I THINK THAT THE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT NEARING THE PARAMETERS OF THE TYPES OF ENTITIES THAT WOULD BE COVERED UNDER THIS BECAUSE WE REALLY DO WANT TO FOCUS ON THE TYPES OF- OF GREGIS IN AND KIND AND MONOPOLY. BEHAVIOR THAT AT LEAST IS AT THE HEART OF THE TALKING POINTS THAT THAT- I'VE HEARD FROM ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE SENATOR- WE TALKED ABOUT MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR VISIT PHYSICIAN PRACTICE GROUPS- DINO THAT CONTINUES TO BE A CONCERN FROM OUR FRIENDS. IN THE CMA. THEY OF COURSE ARE ARE VERY DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLAYERS IN THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION- AND THERE ARE ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE GIVEN THE CORPORATE BAR- WE TALKED ABOUT MORE FLEXIBILITY ON THE DENY LANGUAGE TO GET MORE FLEXIBILITY TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL- AS OPPOSED TO RIGHT NOW WHERE HE'S AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE WAY THE LAWS WRITTEN IN SECTION REQUIRES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO NOT- THE AND- ON AFFILIATION IF ONE OR TWO FACTORS ARE. ARE ARE MATT AND THERE OUGHT TO BE MORE FLEXIBILITY GIVEN. HOW RIGID IT IS RIGHT NOW WE TALK ABOUT MORE MORE DUE PROCESS AS YOU SPOKE ABOUT UPPINGTHE- FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND- THRESHOLD PERHAPS SO AS TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE REALLY FOCSED ON ON- ON ON ON THE BIG ACQUISITIONS AT THAT ARE OF CONCERN AND THEN ALSO LOOKING AT THE ACADEMIC INSTITUTION. DEFINITION THAT WAS PUT IN IN APPROPRIATIONS SO. WITH THOSE WITH THAT CONVERSATION I I'D CERTAINLY FEEL CONFIDENT. THAT THE AUTHOR IS A IS COMMITTED TO REALLY FOCUSING THIS BILL ON. THE P. TALKED ABOUT WHICH IS. MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S SOME OVERSIGHT- OVER- BIG PLAYERS OFTENTIMES OUT OF STATE COMING FROM WALL STREET THAT ARE COMING IN AND TRYING TO. MANIPULATE OUR HEALTH CARE MARKET- WE NEED TO HAVE SOME PROTECTIONS AGAINST THAT. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE AUTHOR SEEKING TO- TO ACCOMPLISH HERE SO I'M CERTAINLY PREPARED TO SUPPORT THE BILL WITH THOSE UNDERSTANDINGS MOVING FORWARD- TODAY. THANK YOU THINK CENTER ALLEN SENATOR PAM. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS- I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB NINE SEVEN SEVEN. I KNOW THAT IT'S- IT'S BEEN REYES. IS THIS THE TIME TO DO IT NOW ACTUALLY- AS YOUR CHAIR OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE ACTUALLY FELT THAT THIS IS THE TIME TO DO IT. OUR HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIAN PRACTICES ARE- SUFFERING ECONOMICALLY. AND WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN IS- SOMEONE WHO DOES HAVE CASH ON HAND- TO GO AND SEE THIS IS AN ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITY TO THEN BUY UP HOSPITALS AND PRACTICES. OF FOR THE PURPOSE OF LATER ON HAVING MARKET LEVERAGE. YEAH IN THEIR MARKETS AND THAT WILL NOT IMPROVE THE HEALTH OUTCOMES ARE IMPROVE ACCESS BUT- SOLELY TO RAISE PRICES. AND THAT IS A THINK WHEN THE ISSUES AND IT'S A COMPLEX ISSUE. THAT THIS BILL IS SEEKING TO ADDRESS AND WHY I THINK THIS BILL IS SO TIMELY. THE TRIGGER FOR THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY ONE THE- ONE PARTY IS ACTUALLY A VERY AS A LARGE HEALTH SYSTEM AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR MAKING A COMMITMENT TO CLARIFYING DATS AND ENSURING THAT ONLY THE LARGEST SYSTEMS WOULD BE INVOLVED IN TRIGGERING BUT THINK ABOUT IT. SO WHAT DOCTOR HAS SAID IS THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE TO BE A THREE HOSPITAL'S MAIN TO START WITH SO IF YOU'RE A TO HOSPITAL CHAIN ABOUT THIRD ONE THIS WOULD NOT TRIGGER ANYTHING YOU'RE READY THREE HOSPITALS SO YOU LOOK AROUND IN YOUR OWN DISTRICTS AND THINK ME HOUSEHOLD YOU HAVE AND SOMEONE ACTUALLY CONTROL READ OF THOSE HOSPITALS. WHAT KIND OF MARKET SIZE TODAY REPRESENT YOUR COMMUNITY AT THAT POINT IN TIME AND THEN- SEEKING TO PERHAPS PURCHASE A FOURTH. OR TAKE OUR OUR CONTROL. A YOU KNOW A LARA AND MEDICAL GROUP OR SOMETHING IN IN THAT AREA AND SO WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR CONVERSATION WITH THE HEALTH PLANS ARE OTHER OF ENTITIES. THE AMOUNT OF LEVERAGE THAT THEY HAVE IN THAT CONVERSATION NOW. THEY SAID THERE'S A TENSION BETWEEN CONSOLIDATION WHICH CAN DRIVE UP PRICES AND ALSO- CAN COOPERATION TO TRY TO IMPROVE QUALITY SO WHAT THIS BILL DOESN'T DO IT DOESN'T SAY YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY BUY THAT FOURTH HOSPITAL AFFILIATE WITH THAT MEDICAL PRACTICE BY THAT'S- INVENTORY SURGERY CENTER. IT SAYS IS THAT WHEN YOU HIT THAT SIZE. WE NEED TO HAVE SOME OVERSIGHT OVER THAT. THE AG'S GONNA HAVE OVERSIGHT AND LOOKING AT THAT AND ANOTHER THING I DO WANNA SAY IN. PERHAPS THE AUTHOR CAN ALSO CLARIFY THIS IS THAT. YES WE DO IN CURRENT EXISTING LAW HAVE REVIEW WHEN NOT FOR PROFITS AND THATIS BASED IS I THINK WAS BUSY MENTION. ON A REVIEW- BASED ON COMMUNITY BENEFIT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT FOR PROFIT. VIEW THAT ASKED IN THIS PARTICULAR BILLS ACTUALLY NARROWER THAN THAT SO IT'S NOT SO BROAD THAT- WELL IF YOU DON'T FEEL COMMUNITY WHAT WOULD YOU DO HAVE TO THE NEW IS THOUGH IS SHOW THAT SHE OF BENEFIT TO THE PATIENTS ARE TAKING CARE OF. SO I KNOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE RAISED SOME CONCERNS I'VE HEARD SAID WELL YOU KNOW THE- AG'S REVIEW OF NOT FOR PROFIT SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE. YOU KNOW EXTENSIVE AND SOMETIMES THEY DEMANDED CERTAIN THINGS- FOR COMMUNITIES. IN FACT IN THIS BILL. THE HEALTH SYSTEM THE LARGE HEALTH SYSTEM. BY THE WAY SO THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES THE SHOW THIS STATE. THERE THAT DAY. THAT THEY HAVE TO SHOW THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A PATIENT BENEFIT TO THIS MERGER AND THAT'S BEYOND. THE MARKET RISK OF ALLOWING THIS CONSOLIDATION SO WE'RE TRYING TO STRIKE THIS BALANCE. NOT TO SAY THAT. YOU CAN'T TO BY OUR AFFILIATE WITH SOMEONE IF YOU'RE READY A BIG SYSTEM. WE'RE SAYING IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE OVERSIGHT AND IF YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY. IT CAN BE PROVEN IN CARE THEN WE'LL LET THIS GO FOR BUT YOU CAN'T DEMONSTRATE THAT AND ALL WE SEE IS THAT YOU GOT THE PRICES ARE GOING TO GO UP. THEN PERHAPS WE SHOULD LET THAT HAPPEN AND I THINK THAT'S A VERY FAIR BALANCE I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR CONSUMING TO DO THE WORK- AND I'M SURE AND ASSEMBLY ETCETERA. RIGHT I DO HOPE THAT YOU WILL VOTE THIS BILL SO THIS CONVERSATION CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND WE CAN HAVE A TIMELESS SOLUTION TO THIS- SO THAT WE DON'T FIND OURSELVES NAY. WE'RE WE'RE HAVE LARGE. RIGHT CORNERED THE MARKET AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO UNWIND OF THOSE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO ACT PRO ACTIVELY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE I OR DENIED IT THANK YOU CENTER PAN SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR MONNING PLEASE CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THE QUESTIONS LET ME JUST ADDRESS A COUPLE ONE COMMENT TO COME WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO WAS MAYBE COVERT NINETEENTH NOT THE TIME WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS STRESS. I WOULD COUNTER IT'S EXACTLY THE TIME WE NEED TO DO IT ALSO COMMENTED ON BY OUR SHARE OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. BECAUSE WE SEE THE MOVE OF THOSE WITH RESOURCES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE WHO ARE IN DISTRESS. WE KNOW THAT FROM TAX ONE HOSPITAL SYSTEM RECEIVED THREE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. AND HAS FURLOUGHED TEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. I WON'T TELL YOU WITH THAT EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PACKAGES THAT'S A FOR PROFIT NETWORK WE REGULATE THE PROFIT MARKET MARKET PLACE GOVERNMENT THAT IS OUR ROLE WE REGULATE HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS THERE ARE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT WE REGULATE THEM TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC INTEREST THIS BILL SEEKS TO APPLY THE SAME REVIEW. TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR TRANSACTIONS THAT WE CURRENTLY DO IN THE IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR. THE BILL PROVIDES A WAIVER FOR CERTAIN RURAL COMMUNITIES AND I KNOW IN WORKING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. HIS GOAL IS TO PROTECT OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT'S HIS SWORN DUTY IT'S ARE SWORN DUTY HE DOESN'T HAVE A MINDSET VYING IN A BLOCK. AN ACQUISITION THAT'S GONNA LEAVE THE COMMUNITY WITHOUT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. IN MY OWN DISTRICT I'VE SEEN BOTH I'VE SEEN IN ATTORNEY GENERAL IMPROVE THE PROSPECTS FOR AN ACQUISITION OF A HOSPITAL IN DISTRESS PART OF A STATEWIDE NONPROFIT SYSTEM IN THE AREA OF GILROY IN MORGAN HILL- BOTH ATTORNEY GENERAL COMMA HARRIS AND ATTORNEY GENERAL. REVIEWED BLOCKS ONE ACT WAS BLOCK AT THE TO GET THE PROSPECTIVE BUYER TO COMMIT TO MAINTAINING CERTAIN SERVICES THE BUYER WASN'T WILLING TO DO THAT NOW IT'S OPERATING UNDER THE AUSPICES OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY ON TO THE BENEFIT OF ALL. IN WATSONVILLE. ONE OF THE MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT AVERAGE FAMILY INCOME NOT INDIVIDUAL FAMILY INCOME EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ER FAMILY. PREDOMINATELY FARMWORKER COMMUNITY THAT FOR PROFIT HOSPITAL WITH AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ACQUIRED BY AN OUT OF STATE HEDGE FUND WITH ONE DOCTOR IN THAT PARTNERSHIP NO HISTORY RUNNING A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND THEY SOUGHT TO HAVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL REVIEWS AT TO JUST TRY TO PROTECT EXISTING SERVICES THE GENERAL SAID. I DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION. SO WE'RE NOT SEEKING TO BLOCK TO IMPEDE OR STOP THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WE DO WANT TO PROVIDE A REVIEW. MECHANISM AS THE DOCTOR FROM SACRAMENTO POINTED OUT I'VE MADE COMMITMENTS TO ONE THE FOUR S. SHOULD I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THIS YES. TO CONTINUE WORK ON THE NARROWING OF SCOPE. AND THE PROTECTIONS OF BALANCE FOR PHYSICIANS FOR SMALL GROUPS ETCETERA I MAKE THAT COMMITMENT TO ALL OF YOU HERE ON THE FLOOR TODAY. THE WAY OUR SYSTEM WORKS TO FIND GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE THIS TO THE ASSEMBLY. TO WORK WITH THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE. IN A FIVE BRING. EVERYONE CAN SEE FIVE MAINTAIN THOSE COMMITMENTS FIVE ACHIEVE THOSE COMMITMENTS IN IF NOT. VOTE ME DOWN BUT I ASKED TODAY FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY I DO WANT TO THANK TOM THE GOOD DOCTOR FROM SACRAMENTO WHO IS CHAIR OF HEALTH. PUT SOME AMENDMENTS IN THE BILL TO CREATE SOME FURTHER METRICS ESTABLISH NATIONAL NET METRICS TO MEASURE HEALTH OUTCOMES TO MEASURE INPUTS DESIGNED TO PROTECT. PUBLIC IN COMMUNITY HEALTH THE STRENGTH IN THE BILL. I WANT TO THANK THE GOOD SENATOR FROM LOCKING YADA WHO ALSO- STRENGTH IN THE BILL WAS SOME. INPUTS FOR THE- ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE ADVISORY BOARD THAT'S CONTEMPLATED. TO BE SUBJECT TO CONFLICT OF INTEREST LAWS IT CETERA- MOM AND I WANT TO THINK THE OTHERS TO THEM ENGAGED WITH THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SANTA MONICA. THE GOOD SENATOR TOM FROM HEALDSBURG WHO HAVE ENGAGE WITH KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THE BILL CURRENTLY DOES IN WITH IMPORTS OF WHERE WE WANT IT TO GO AS WE MOVE FORWARD FRIENDS. THE TIME IS NOW.

FORTY FIVE INTO THE WATER I THESE DANGEROUS CHEMICALS ARE ALSO CONTAMINATED DRINKING WATER ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY I'VE THEY HAVE A PROJECTED COST TO WATER UTILITIES NOW OF TWELVE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT DECADE. SO THEY CAN LAYS A GENTLEMAN THIS IS BECOMING AN ENORMOUS LIABILITY FOR THE WATER DISTRICTS THAT PROVIDE DRINKING WATER TO OUR CONSTITUENTS- AND NOW THE ESTIMATES ARE THAT IN CALIFORNIA THE WATER SUPPLIES FOR AT LEAST SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE- OF FIGHTS IN THEIR WATER. NOW ONE OF THE PRIME DESERVE CONTAMINATION PARTICULAR FOR A WATER SUPPLY. IS FIRE FIGHTING FOAMS USED TO FIGHT LIQUID FIRES. AND WE KNOW THE FIREFIGHTERS ARE ALREADY AT AN INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING HEALTH PROBLEMS ELEVATED RISK OF DEFIES CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED IN THE BODIES OF FIREFIGHTERS PUTTING THEM AT EVEN GREATER RISK OF HARM.

HI THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE IT'S SUPPORTED BY OUR WATER AGENCIES BECAUSE GIVEN THE CONTAMINATION LEVELS. IN OUR DRINKING WATER THE LEAST WE CAN DO TO STOP MAKING THE PROBLEM WORSE. AND OF COURSE I WILL SAY THAT OUR FIREFIGHTERS ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS BILL AND LET'S LET'S ALL BE STRAIGHT ABOUT THIS FIREFIGHTERS KNOWS. ABOUT THE FIRE.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I HAVE THE PLEASURE TO SIT ON EQ WITH THE CHAIRMAN HERE WHO'S WHO HAS THIS BILL AND I LAID OFF THE BILL IN BECAUSE THERE WAS A FEW. FOLKS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET SOME AMENDMENTS TO ALLOW THEM TO PHASE OUT INTO IN TIME VETERAN AND WHERE WE DON'T HAVE. THAT WHAT WE'RE WAS MAINLY FOR. THE HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF REALLY HIGH A FLAMMABLE LIQUIDS LIKE- IN A REFINERY AREAS AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE WORKING WITH THEM AND I APPRECIATE THAT. ACTUALLY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. I KNOW YOU'RE STILL LOOKING AT SOME AMENDMENTS FOR THEM YEAH AND I'M HOPING THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO WORK THAT OUT SO THAT IT NO CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE. AND THEY HAVE. A BIT HARD TIME CONTAINING KNOWS A BUYERS THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO. A LITTLE MORE TIME OR OR COME UP WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY TO DO IT SO- REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING AND- IT'S ALL THE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. AND LOOKING. DOLLY CENTER ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TODAY IN COURT SB. TEN FORTY FOUR I BELIEVE PHASING OUT OF A P. A.'S ALSO KNOWN AS FIFA'S IN OUR FIGHT A FIRE IN FULL IS A GOOD POLICY. IN FACT SO THERE'S UNITED STATES MILITARY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HAS ALSO BEGUN TO PHASE OUT IF PH IN THE PHONE. FOLLOWING A SIMILAR TIMELINE AS LAID OUT ON SB TEN FORTY FOUR. HOWEVER NO THE INDUCTOR FIREFIGHTER STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS REGARDING THE PHONE. THAT AND THE PHONES THAT DO NOT CONTAIN AT PH WORKING AS WELL AS THE FOR THE F. PH PHONE WHEN DEALING WITH REFINERY FIRES. SO I WOULD URGE THE SENATOR FROM SANTA MONICA TO CONTINUE WITH THESE STAKEHOLDERS. TOWARDS OF NARAL WAIVER JEFF THESE INDUSTRIAL FIREFIGHTERS GET HAVE PROPER TOOLS AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THE REFINERY- WELL FIRES IN IRAQ LAST RIVAL. HE SAID. SENATOR BUT- YES I SUPPORT THIS BILL THE ONE CONCERN I HAVE BEEN SET AND THE DATE CENTER FROM. LOS ANGELES ALSO HAD I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONNECTED HERE- I HAVE THREE REFINERIES OF MY DISTRICT THAT- RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD.

MORE DANGER YEAH YEAH YEAH BLOOD LUST ABILITY TO PUT OUT A FIRE PUT IT OUT NOW SO THAT- WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT THE OTHER DAY DANGER TO THE NEIGHBORS AROUND SO WILL THERE BE AN EXTENSION GIVEN A MAYBE I- IT MINISTRY TO DO DOWN THE LINE IF THEIR TECHNOLOGY THAT- WILL BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE- YEAH SO WE'RE WE'RE IN DISCUSSIONS OF ALONG THE LINES OF I'M SO SORRY THROUGH THE CHAIR. START WITH A PLEASE PROCEED. HI IT'S BASICALLY A THE LINES WHAT THE SENATOR. TERMS OF LA COUNTY WAS TALKING ABOUT WHICH WOULD BE A VERY NARROW WAIVERS AND THAT THAT THAT'S THE DESCRIPTION THE IDEA BEING WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE IF THERE TRULY IS NO ALTERNATIVE.

IT'S NOT UP OKAY. MAYBE CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW. THANK YOU. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT THEIR- THERE SOME FIREFIGHTERS OUT THERE WHO TEND TO CERTAIN TYPES OF BUYERS THEY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE THAT THEY NEED AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. HOWEVER EIGHT TRADERS KNOW THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED FOR DONNELLY FOR THE JOB THAT THEY'RE DOING IT THEY'RE SAYING THAT THIS TYPE OF TOOL IS CAUSING THEM HARM THAT I THINK WE OUGHT TO LISTEN TO THEM- I HAVE A FIRE FIGHTER IN MY DISTRICT WHO PASSED AWAY RECENTLY FROM CANCER AND- YOUR RECORD BREAKING. NO YOU KNOW WHAT BUT HE WAS A FIREFIGHTER BY TRADE SO YOU HAVE TO THINK THAT IT WAS YOU KNOW SOMETHING ANY CAME BACK AND CAME BACK HE BEAT ONCE THEY CAME BACK HE BE TO BACK ONCE AGAIN ANY CAME ULTIMATELY SUCCUMB TO CANCER AND YOU KNOW WE'RE PRETTY CONVINCED IT WAS JOB. NEEDED SO I DON'T KNOW HOW I'D STAND THERE AND SAY WELL DEAN.

ARE AT STAKE. EVER I'M CONCERNED THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM MAYBE. TOO RIGID I'M NOT YET CONVINCED THAT THERE ARE SPECIFIC INSTANCES WHERE AN ALTERNATIVE TO BE FAST. IS NOT AVAILABLE OR SUFFICIENT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT AND I HEARD THAT YOUWILL BE A CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION SO I. HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO DO SO. I SUPPORT WHAT THE BILL IS TRYING TO DO. BUT IT THE COMPANIES TO BE TIGHTENED UP I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND HOPEFULLY I CAN SEE SOME AMENDMENT FUTURE. VERY MUCH.

THANK YOU- MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS SB TEN SIXTY FOUR WOULD REQUIRE CDC ARE TO FOLLOW COMPARABLE DUE PROCESS PROCEDURES. THAT CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES FOR TRIALS REGARDING THE USE OF IN CUSTODY INFORMANTS. UNDER OUR LAW WE DO NOT ALLOWED. EITHER TESTIMONY OR CONVICTIONS FROM ONE CORROBORATED IN CUSTODY IN FORM. HOWEVER PROCESS IS IN PLACE REGARDING INCARCERATED IN CUSTODY INFORMANTS AS A RESULT SUCH UNCORROBORATED INFO CAN NOW BE ENTERED INTO A CONFIDENTIAL PRISON FILES AND PRESENTED AT PAROLE HEARINGS FOR USED TO JUSTIFY DISCIPLINE. SB TEN SIXTY FOUR DOES NOT REQUIRE DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMANTS IDENTITY THE INFORMANT CAN STAY ANONYMOUS WHICH IS CLEARLY ESSENTIAL FOR THE PERSONS- OWN A PROTECTION. BUT WHAT YES BE TEN SIXTY FOUR DOES IS REQUIRE THAT AN ACCUSATION BE CORROBORATED BEFORE IT CAN BE SUBMITTED TO EITHER THE PRO BOARD OR USED TO DISAPPOINT AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

WILK THE CENTERS CAN REMOVE THE CALL MOVING TO FILE ITEM TWENTY EIGHT ALSO SENATOR SKINNER MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL TEN SEVENTY NINE BY SENATOR SKINNER AND ACTUALLY NEED TO REAL PROPERTY. SENATOR SKINNER THANK YOU- MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS HOMEOWNERSHIP AS I THINK MOST OF US APPRECIATE IS AN ESSENTIAL PATH FOR WELL QUESTION. IN OUR FAMILIES- BUT ACCORDING AND NOT BUT ACCORDING TO FORBES THE TYPICAL HOMEOWNER IN ACHIEVES A- MULTIPLE FORTY FIVE TIMES THE FINANCIAL ACHIEVEMENT THEN A RENTER OVER A LIFETIME. NOW WITH THE FOR CLOSURES OF THE LAST RECESSION CALIFORNIA'S OWNER OCCUPIED HOMEOWNERSHIP DROPPED BY OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. AND RENTER OCCUPIED SINGLE FAMILY HOMES INCREASED BY SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND. THIS FALL AND HOMEOWNERSHIP BY FORBES OWN ACCOUNT WAS NOT THE THOSE FORECLOSURES LARGE CORPORATE VESTER SPOT UP FOR CLOSE ROOMS AT ROCK BOTTOM PRICES. AND MANY HOMES WERE LEFT VACANT WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED NEIGHBORHOODS. AND OTHERS WERE RENTED BY THESE CORPORATE INVESTORS CREATING ACCORDING TO WALL STREET A NEW ASSET CLASS SINGLE FAMILY HOME RENTALS. THIS INCREASE IN THE CORPORATE HOMEOWNERSHIP ARTIFICIALLY RAISED HOME PRICES IN CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS AND FOR MANY OF THE RENTERS THEY EXPERIENCED LEASES WITH VERY PUNITIVE AND COSTLY PROVISIONS AND MANY HOME OWNERS OF FORMER HOMEOWNERS OF THE HOME FOUND THEMSELVES RENTING FROM THOSE ENTITIES. NOW WHAT THE INTENT OF SB TEN SEVENTY NINE IS TO PREVENT THAT SAME SCENARIO IF WE AND I HOPE WE DO NOT FACE A WAVE OF FORECLOSURES ANYWHERE AT THE LEVEL THAT WE DID IN THE LAST RECESSION. THE TEN SEVEN NINE HAS THREE KEY ELEMENTS. IT ALLOWS FOR. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NONPROFIT HOUSING DEVELOPERS AND PERSPECTIVE OWNER OCCUPANTS THE ABILITY TO HAVE A WINDOW TO BID ON FORECLOSED HOMES AHEAD OF INVESTORS. IT THEN LIMITS PURCHASE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF FOR CLOSE TO HOME AT A SINGLE ACTION. AND IT ALSO ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM I MENTIONED WE'RE HOMES MAY BE LEFT VACANT. IT ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE FINES ON VACANT ON MAINTAINED FORECLOSED PROPERTIES. THAT'S FINE IT'S NOT MANDATED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO NOT HAVE TO USE IT AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT IT CAN ONLY BE ISSUED AFTER A THIRTY DAY NOTICE. AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR GORGEOUS. MEMBERS OF THE QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. THERE'S CAN WE TAKE A QUESTION YES PLEASE PROCEED IN A SCENARIO WHERE A COMMERCIAL COMPLEX WITH MIGHT HAVE. IT MIGHT BE IT- STRUCTURALLY ESSENTIALLY ONE COMPLEX BUT WITH MULTIPLE A P. ENDS FOR A MULTI FAMILY. WITH MULTI- MULTIPLE ATMS. HOW WOULD IT WORK IN THIS SITUATION. THIS THIS STATUTE BEFORE US IS. IT'S TARGETED IN LANGUAGES SPECIFIC TO SINGLE FAMILY FOUR CLOSE TERMS NOT MULTI UNIT PROPERTIES. I HAPPEN AND ON. TO KNOW OF THE UNITS FOR EXAMPLE AT THAT ARE IN A COMPLEX INDIVIDUAL LET'S SEE TOWN OMES BUT THEY'RE IN A COMPLEX WITH MULTIPLE EIGHT PM. WITH THIS APPLY TO THE. I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY HOW TO ANSWER THE QUESTION IF THE TOWN HOME IS UNDER ITS TITLE CONSIDERED A SINGLE FAMILY HOME IT COULD APPLY YES BUT IT WOULD. SO YES IN THAT CASE OKAY THANK YOU AND ALSO CONCLUDE TO BUY I THINK THE AUTHOR. HAS SEIZED ON SOMETHING THAT IS REAL IN MY FORMER CAPACITY IS A SUPERVISOR I THINK WE HAVE SEEN- MAJOR INVESTMENT FIRMS BY UP THESE THINGS AND- YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE BUREAUCRACY OF HOW DO YOU GET THEM TO REHABILITATE THE PROPERTY AND ESPECIALLY AS THEY'RE LOOKING TO FLIP IT SO THERE IS A DEFINITE TRUTH TO THIS- I WOULD. OTHERWISE HOPE THOUGH THAT LOCAL CONTROL WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT IN THIS SITUATION- AND IF THEY WANT TO IMPOSE GREATER FINES OR IF THEY WANT TO CREATE RESTRICTIONS- I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE A FLOOD OF FORECLOSED PROPERTIES UNFORTUNATELY. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO BE AT THE TWO THOUSAND TENS LEVEL BUT PANDEMIC WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY GOING TO CREATE THESE PROBLEMS AND COUNTIES ARE GOING TO NEED TO UNLOAD THEM QUICKLY AND RESTRICTIONS THIS COULD CREATE A PROBLEM. THAT IS ONLY CAN. THANK YOU CENTER JUST THE SCENE OF TO ACTION AND- SEND SKINNER PLEASE. YES THANK YOU SO APPRECIATE YOUR RAISING THE ISSUE ABOUT THE FINES THE FINES% WHILE THIS STATUTE. DOES ALLOW THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. OR RATHER IT INCREASES THE CAP. THAT IS NOW IN PLACE. IT IS NOT REQUIRED THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO USE IT IN SO IN THIS RESPECT THE COMPLETELY HONORS LOCAL CONTROL. SO IF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHOOSES NOT TO LET ME FIND AT ALL THAT IS UP TO THEM OR IF THEY CHOOSE TO FOLLOW. THE FORMER FINDS THAT THEY HAD BEEN UTILIZING THAT IS ALSO UP TO THEM. THIS IS JUST FOR THOSE CASES WERE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS REALLY SEEING AN EGREGIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE AND I WOULD- JUST GIVE A PERSONAL. I VIVIDLY RECALL DURING THE LAST RECESSION. TOURING WITH THE CITY MANAGER AND OTHER OFFICIALS. BLOCKS OF AREAS IN BOTH THE CITY OF RICHMOND IN THE CITY OF OAKLAND. WHERE MANY MANY MANY HOMES WERE FORECLOSED BANDS THAT IT A SINGLE THERE WAS ACTUALLY TO SINGLE CORPORATIONS THAT BOUGHT UP MOST OF THE PROPERTIES. AND LEFT THEM. AND THOSE PROPERTIES AND THEN IN A COURSE REMEMBER DURING THAT RECESSION. THEY WERE STRIPPED OF ALL TYPES OF COPPER WIRING OF IT I MEAN THE THIS CONDITION WAS- SO DISGUSTED. BAND THE FEW NEIGHBORS THAT REMAINED HAD TO LIVE IN BLOCKS OF THESE VERY VERY. DERELICT PROPERTIES AND THE CITIES WHILE THEY WERE FINING AND MAKING NOTICES THEY WERE GETTING NO RESPONSE WHATSOEVER. ON THOSE INTO THE BILL IS REALLY I HOPE THAT THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN IF WE ARE HOPE NUMBER ONE THAT WE DO NOT FACE SERIES KNOWN FORECLOSURES AND NUMBER TWO THAT WE DO NOT FACE THAT KIND OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. BUT THIS IS SIMPLY A TOOL IN YES WE DO AND WITH THAT I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALLEN I ARCHULETA AYE ATKINS AYE BATES.

STERN I'M BURKE SENATOR MOVES THE CALL MEMBERS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD THE FILE TO FILE ITEM FORTY SEVEN SENATOR CABALLERO MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL FOURTEEN TEN BY SENATOR CABALLERO AND ACTUALLY TO TENDENCY CENTER CABALLERO THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SB FOURTEEN TEN. WHICH IS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF TENANTS THAT ARE AT RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS BECAUSE THEY ARE BEHIND IN THE RENTAL PAYMENTS BECAUSE OF THE COLBERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND ALSO TO HELP PUT MONEY IN THE HEAD OF LANDLORDS WHO NEED TO KEEP UP PAYMENTS ON THEIR PROPERTIES. THIS BILL PUT FORTH FOR KEY PROVISIONS ONE IT ALLOWSLANDLORDS TO ENTER INTO VOLUNTARY IF YOU CAN RELIEF AGREEMENTS WITH TENANTS. GAVE UNPAID AND IT CHANGED. CREDIT INVEST. TEN YEARS TO REPAY THE STATE THE UNPAID RENT IN ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR INTEREST FREE THE TAX CREDIT FOR LANDLORDS CAN BE RETAINED FOR USE IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR OR SOLD FOR IMMEDIATE CASH RELIEF. AND FOR A PROHIBITS LANDLORDS FROM EVICTING A TENANT DURING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY UNLESS THE LANDLORD OFFERS THE TENANT THE RELIEF AGREEMENT. OR THE EVICTION IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD WHICH WAS SET UP BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL EMERGENCY RULE OF COURT DURING THIS PANDEMIC. AND FINALLY THE BILL PROVIDE FURTHER AID TO RENTERS BY ALLOWING QUALIFYING QUALIFYING PARTICIPANTS THE ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO FORGIVE SOME OF ALL OF THE DEFERRED RENT. BASED ON INCOME LEVEL. AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE STATE ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. UNEMPLOYMENT HAS PASSED 16% THIS MONTH HIGHER THAN AT ANY POINT DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. AND SINCE APRIL WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF RENTERS CORNET WHO ARE UNABLE TO PAY ALL OR SOME PART OF THE RENT ON TIME IN THE REALLY GOOD THING IS THAT. MOST OF IT APPEARS THAT MOST OF THE RENTERS ARE PAYING HARSH AT LEAST PARTIAL PAYMENTS ON WHAT THE- THIS IS WHY WE CANNOT WAIT TO MOVE A POLICY SOLUTION FOR THAT WILL ADDRESS THE NEED TO BOAST TENANTS. AND LANDLORDS ALIKE AND QUITE FRANKLY THIS IS HAS BECOME THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT I'M HEARING IN MY DISTRICT IS THAT PEOPLE JUST ARE DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CATCH THEMSELVES UP BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN WORKING. AND COMPOUNDED WITH THE FACT THAT DE DE DE HAS STILL NOT PROVIDED. BENEFITS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ALL ABOUT ELIGIBLE BENEFITS MAKES IT VERY VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE E'S FAMILIES ARE REALLY STRUGGLING. THE START THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY AND IN THE COMING WEEKS SHOULD THIS BILL MOVED TO THE ASSEMBLY. WE WILL EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF TENANTS TO CONTINUE TO PAY WHAT THEY CAN TO WORDS OR RENT. AND TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEIR LANDLORDS IN THE EVENT THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO DO SO. LASTLY THIS BILL HAS BEEN IN PRINT FOR A LITTLE A LITTLE OVER A WEEK AND THERE IS MUCH TO BE DONE. I CAN GET TO MY COLLEAGUES. AND THE STATE RESTORE TOGETHER IN FAMILY SURE THE PROPER DISTRICT BETWEEN BENEFITS PROVIDED TO BOTH TENANTS. AND LANDLORDS AND WE STARTED TO DO OUR RICH TOO- THE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE BUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR- VOTE TODAY. YOU SENATOR CABALLERO. A DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I'M PROUD TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUE FROM SELENA'S ENJOYING AUTHOR OF AS THE FOURTEEN CAN THIS IS ISSUE OF GREAT CONCERN AS- WELL CHAIR OF THE SENATE ECONOMIC RECOVERY TASK FORCE THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DEBATED ITEMS IN ADDITION TO THAT WE CAN WORK ON FOR ALMOST TWO MONTHS. FIVE URGENT WRIST TO CRISIS IT IMPACTING AHA SO AND- DEALING WITH FORECLOSURES EVEN BEFORE THE COLBERT NINETEEN CRISIS THERE WAS WELL OVER A MILLION RENTERS WHO WERE STRUGGLING TO MAKE. A RENT PAYMENT STATUS ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED TO THE JOB LOSS AND WHAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS. IT'S MOST BALLOT THAT IF A TENTATIVE STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR RENT THEN I LANDLORDS ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE. THERE FIVE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR AGAIN MANY TIMES WE THINK OF APARTMENT OWNERS AS THESE MULTI MILLION DOLLAR CONGLOMERATES AND THEY ARE THE THOSE THAT EXIST OUT THERE BUT MANY OF THESE FOLKS- MOM AND POP FRONTLINE WORKERS WHO'VE INVESTED THERE ARE BUS DRIVERS THERE ARE SCHOOL TEACHERS ARE MALE MATT WHO BEST PROPERTY A LOT OF TIME- OWNER OCCUPIED. UNITS A HAVE A TRI PLEX OR DUPLEX AND- THEY RENT THOSE OUT FOR THEIR RETIREMENT IT'S THEIR- KIDS COLLEGE FUND SO THESE ARE NOT WEALTHY PEOPLE SO WE TOOK THAT IN MIND MAKING SURE THAT WE PROTECT PROTECTED THEM. AS WELL AS A TENANT. WE HAVE TALKED TO CONSTITUENTS AS- MY COLLEAGUES STATED FROM SALINAS IS IN THIS IS. I ISSUE THAT REQUIRES A STACK NOW. AND THIS BILL IS JUST ONE OF MANY RESPONSES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AT DURING THIS CRISIS. TENDED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE RELIEF PROGRAM WILL STAY IN THEIR HOMES AND THEY WILL REPAY THE GRANT IN TIME. LANDLORDS TO PARTICIPATE WILL GET A TAX CREDIT AS STATED AND THEY CAN EITHER KEEP THAT TAX CREDIT OR SELL IT- THE HELP FILMS KEEP MAKING THEIR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE FOR TENANTS TO PAY THEIR RENT. WE HOPE IT'S AN INCENTIVE FOR THE- TENANT TO PAY THEIR RENT BECAUSE ZERO. SAFEGUARDS BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK OUT AFTER THOSE WONDERFUL TENANTS AND THOSE VULNERABLE LANDLORDS- THEY MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T MAKE THE SITUATION WORSE. WHAT CORPORATE DROWNED OT STRUGGLING TENANTS CAN BE EVICTED. PROPERTY OWNERS ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE AND PAY THEIR PROPERTY TAXES WE CAN'T LEAVE THOSE FOLKS WITHOUT A PATH. OUT OF THIS CRISIS. SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE RAISED CONCERNS BECAUSE OF EARNS EARNS UNCERTAIN COSTS AS MY COLLEAGUE DAVID THIS IS THE ISSUE HAT STILL IN DEBATE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SURE HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM. AND A PERFECT BUT WE WOULD HOPE NOT WILL. IN IT- I'M MORE WOULD HAVE TO- PARTICIPATE BUT WE WANT TO PUT THE SAVE OUR DEMAND- IN PLACE AS MY COLLEAGUE STATE WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK. BUT ALL INTEREST GROUP TEMP BILL FOR AND WE- ALL THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY ACT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR JOURNEY FIVE. NUMBERS THAT'S FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD SENATOR ATKINS. RENDON PRESIDENT THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I TO BE HONEST A LOT OF WHAT I WANTED TO SAY HAS BEEN SAID THAT I WANTED TO BE VERY CLEAR. THAT I WANT TO KNOWLEDGE AND THANK THE GOOD SENATORS FROM SALINAS AND GUARDINO FOR A- REALLY TAKEN OF THIS AND CHAMPION A FIVE AND BRING IT BEFORE YOU'RE- A- I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE- MAJORITY LEADER IN OUR BUT CHAIR. OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ECONOMIC WITH FREE WORKING GROUP THAT THE US DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS PUT TOGETHER. PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OUR WE HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING VERY HARD TO FIND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS. DON'T FALL. MONEY FROM THE STATE. WHICH WE DON'T HAVE. OUR OTHER. WAYS FOR THIS SO. I'M GOING APPLAUD THEM FOR THE CREATIVE ARE PROCESS IN BRINGING THIS FORWARD FOR US TO CONSIDER. BUT I DO WANT TO RE EMPHASIZE IT HAS BEEN SEVEN I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HEAR. THIS BILL IS NOT A GIVEAWAY TENANTS ARE STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING RENT AND LANDLORDS WILL LIKELY GET A HAIR CUT. BUT IT DOES PROVIDE SOME TEMPORARY RELIEF TO ALL THE PARTIES. YOU KNOW I LIKE IN THE STATE ARE TRYING HARD TO FLATTEN THE COAT. FOR IT AS IT RELATES TO OUR HEALTHCARE OR HEALTH THIS. THIS IS FLAG ME. ARE THE- FOR. WEIGHT PEOPLE CAN MAYBE HANDLE A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN HAVING NO SOLUTION. AND IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT CREATIVELY HOW TO DO THESE THINGS. ARE TWO CALLS AS LITTLE HARM AS POSSIBLE WE DON'T HAVE. EVERY ANSWER. IT IS TRUE BUT THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE EFFORT TO REALLY HELP HURTING CALIFORNIANS RENTERS AND LANDLORDS PARTICULARLY. ARE I WOULD SAY NOT ENTIRELY BUT PARTICULARLY THE SMALLER LANDLORDS WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR INVESTMENT. THEY DON'T LOSE AND I'M SURE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE HURTING PEOPLE AS WELL THESE ARE THEIR TENANTS I'VE HEARD THAT AGAIN AND AGAIN FROM THE LANDLORD. FINAL IS THE EITHER SAID THEY'RE STILL WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS I AM FULL AN OPTIMISTIC NOTE. THAT WE CAN FIND SO SINCE THE KEY CAN IT'S- THE STAFF FARM. AND I KNOW AND HOPE THAT BOTH PLAN TEN CAN. IN GOOD FAITH TOGETHER TO FIND SOLUTIONS AND CRITICS INCREDIBLY HIGH QUALITY AFTER OUR AND SENATE BILL TEN THANK YOU THINK IS THANK YOU THERE AT ARMS WE. OKAY YOU MADAM. I WILL BE SUPPORT WELL AS BEFORE TEN TODAY BUT I SO. AS I STATED IN GOVERNMENT TO FIND WITH INTO THAT IS MORE WORK- THAT IS NEEDED ON THIS BILL- WE DO FACE A HUGE RISK OF MASS PROTECTIONS FOR NOT JUST AFFECTIONS THE PEOPLES OF LEAVING I GOT A TEXT THIS MORNING FROM A SMALL LANDLORD I KNOW AND SAN FRANCISCO IN FOUR EIGHT THAT SEVEN OF HIS EIGHTEEN TENANTS. HAVE SIMPLY VACATED. NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE DYING TO VACATE BUT THEY HAD NO WAY OF PAYING THE RENT. AND SOMEONE TENANTS CAN PAY THE RENT AND EITHER ADDICTED OR LEAVE. THAT IS TERRIBLE FOR THE TENANTS IT'S TERRIBLE FOR THE COMMUNITY AS A RESIDENTS OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND IT'S BAD FOR THE LANDLORDS BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO STRUGGLE TO RE RENT A PLACE IT'S INCUMBENT ON ALL OF US. STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO STABILIZE RENTERS IN THEIR HOMES. OTHERWISE WE ARE GOING TO STRUGGLE TO RECOVER. WITH RESPECT TO SB FOURTEEN AND I AM VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE CREATIVE THINKING AND WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE KEEPING ALL PARTIES NEEDS AN ACCOUNT BUT I WANTED TO POINT OUT A FEW THINGS AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN. CONTINUE TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES FIRST OF ALL THIS IS VOLUNTARY IF THE LANDLORD DOESN'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE. PAN THE BILL DOESN'T GET TRIGGERED AND SO THERE WILL BE RENTS. ARE NOT PROGRAM WHO NEED FOR TIME AND THAT CAN BE DONE THIS THROUGH AMENDMENTS THEY'RE ALSO SEVERAL ASSEMBLY BILL IS TO PROTECT RUN THROUGH THAT ARE PENDING. IN THE SENATE RIGHT NOW. FIVE SECONDS. WITH RESPECT TO THE REPAYMENT BY THE RENTERS. FIVE TO BE CLEAR WHAT PEOPLE NEED TO DO THERE IS A SLIDING SCALE SO FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LOWER INCOME. AND HAVE PART FOR ALL THEIR- RENT OWED TO THE STATE WAVED AND THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT I'M APPRECIATIVE OF THE AUTHORS HAVE PUT THAT INTO THE BILL. ON HOWEVER THE MECHANISM TO REPAY IT'S OVER TEN YEARS IT IS THROUGH YOUR TAX RETURN THE FILE SO IF YOU ARE TOO POOR. TO FILE A TAX RETURN IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INCOME EUROPE'S VERY OR EXTREMELY LOW. INCOME RENTERS YOU ALL HAVE START. FILING A TAX RETURN EVEN THOUGH YOU NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE. AND THAT IS TRUE IF YOU ARE UNDOCUMENTED MAYBE YOU'VE MAYBE YOU DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH- MAYBE YOU ARE FRAIL SENIOR. YOU KNOW HOW TO START FILING A TAX RETURN IN ORDER TO CLAIM THE WAIVER OF THE RENT AND I CAN THAT THAT'S SIGNIFICANCE AND THAT THAT IS A BAD DAY OR- MOREOVER. LEAVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE TO FILE A CALIFORNIA TAX RETURN EVERY YEAR AND SO I CITY THINGS NINE OPPOSITION SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL I WANT THIS BILL TO SUCCEED- BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE REALLY WORKING THANKS TO THE PEOPLE CAN CAN USE SAYS THAT IT'S NOT A BIRD AND PARTICULARLY ON OUR LOWEST INCOME VULNERABLE RENTERS. OUR SENIORS- PEOPLE WHO DON'T. SPEAK ENGLISH. PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW THERE THEY HAVE THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS ISN'T A BARRIER AND THAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY USE A SO I SUPPORT THIS BUT I- LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUING WORK AN EVOLUTION OF THIS BILL TO MAKE IT AS GREAT AS IT CAN BE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER CENTER FOR. THANK YOU A- MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT TO JOIN WITH THE PRO TEM IN THANKING THE SENATORS FROM SELLING US AND- MY CO CHAIR FOR DINNER AND WORKING ON THIS MATTER RIGHT. I START IN IT AND ALSO I WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF AND BUDGET STAFF FOR THEIR EXTRAORDINARY WORK ON ALL OF THIS. THIS EFFORT HERE ARM YOU KNOW LAST NIGHT WHEN THE BUDGET SHARE OF CLOSE TO TALK ABOUT HOW THEY WERE SIGNIFICANT PLANS THAN THOSE CHANGE WHEN WE HAD A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THE WORLD CHANGED. AND SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE AND WHAT THE EFFORT AFOOT IS. WELL THE GOVERNOR WAS DEEPLY ENGAGED IN HAS BEEN DEEPLY ENGAGED IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH ELEMENT. THE PRO TEMPORE TOGETHER A WORKING GROUP OF A WHOLE HOST OF US TO BEGIN TO ANALYZE AND COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS OF HOW THE HOW THE BALANCE OCCURS. SHE ARTICULATED WERE ON THE ONE HAND WE DO THE LEAST AMOUNT OF HARM TO THE BUDGET TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET AND EDUCATION ALL THE OTHER NECESSARY SERVICES. AND THE OTHER HAND THE UPS THIS WALL HYKSOS AS THIS IS THE FEDERAL START TO WOULD WHICH START BEING VERY SHORTLY WE- WHAT WE- CAN TO THE FRAMEWORK AROUND THIS JUST. MY CAR SPEAKERS. HELLO HE ARTICULATED OF THIS MESS THAT THERE IS NO FREE RIDE THIS IS THE BALLOTS WERE PEOPLE GET A HIT ON THE HEAD THE STATE OF THE OTHER. WE CAN BASIC. SO PORT TO MAKE THAT PEOPLE KEPT IN THEIR HOMES AND NOT BECOME HOMELESS IN A WAY WHERE ULTIMATELY THE CONSEQUENCES TO SOCIETY THE DEMAND OF THE SAFETY THAT WOULD BE MUCH MORE EXTREME. IN A WAY THAT OFF THE COSTS TO FUTURE YEARS WHEN WE CAN AFFORD TO PAY FOR THE IDEAS THAT WE HAVE A THREE YEAR EVENT HORIZON TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN KEEPING PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES WILL BE HELPING SMALL BUSINESSES PROVIDING TOOLS THAT ARE NECESSARY. FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND IS A CORE OF THIS IS THIS ELEMENT WHERE PEOPLE MAKE A SHOWING THAT THEY'VE GOT THE HARM THAT WE KEEP IN THEIR HOMES WERE LANDLORDS ARE BEING TAKEN CARE OF WITH THE WITH THE F. B. FUNGIBLE PAYMENT METHODOLOGY RESIDENT INFORMED. BUT DOES IMPOSE UPON THE CURRENT A BUDGET YEARS IT HAS ALSO SOME ELEMENTS WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED AS YOU MOVE FORWARD HOLD ON YOUR TAX CREDITS ACTION REDUCE TAX. IS BEING OR INCOME GET. USED HOLD ON TO THESE TAX CREDITS YEAR INSTEAD OF SELLING. THERE'S A WHOLE OF ELEMENTS TO THIS APPROACH THAT HAS GREAT BENEFITS FOR ALL PARTIES SHOULD MAKE SURE. THAT WHERE IS WAS EXPRESSED BY THE SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO. PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS TO PAY THEY'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TO PAY BUT IF YOU DO HAVE THE FUNDS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY BACK THE STATE. SO THIS IS REALLY WHAT THOUGHT THROUGH AGAIN I WANT TO GIVE GREAT CREDIT TO. THE TO MY CULTURE TO THE- AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE AND TO THE PRO TEM STAFF THEY GET IS A ERY WORTHY. AND THOUGHTFUL A- TO LEGISLATION UNDER VERY VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES I ASK YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG SENATOR DURAZO. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I ALSO RISE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL- I WOULD LIKE TO ASK A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR THERE TO COME HERE WE TAKE A QUESTION. THANK YOU. ALSO FOR THESE PROCEED THANK YOU. I KNOW THIS I THINK THIS IS BEEN BROUGHT UP BY OF- OTHERS BUT I JUST WANT TO GET SOME CLARITY AS FAR AS A DIRECT- AND AGAIN I'M SUPPORTING THIS BILL BUT THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ASKED OF ME. HOW DO YOU HAND. LANDLORDS WHO DO NOT WANT TO ENTER INTO THIS KIND OF AGREEMENT. AND WHAT IS IT WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE THOSE TENANTS- EXCELLENT EXCELLENT QUESTION. TERRY THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM AND IF THE LANDLORD INTENDS TO EVICT A TENANT FOR NON PAYMENT OF RENT THEN THEY HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM IF THEY DECLINE THAT THEN THEY CAN NOT CONVICTED TENANTS. OKAY AS I CAN YOU SAY THAT ONE MORE TIME I'M TRYING TO YES YEAH THE WAY THE PROCESS IS GOING TO WORK. IS THAT THE LANDLORD. HAS TO OFFERED THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THE TENANT OKAY. AND LET'S SAY THE TENANTS SAYS YES I'D LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE LANDLORD. IT WAS A SHAM. THE LANDLORD IS NOT ABLE AT THAT POINT TO AFFECT THE TENANT. OKAY FOR NON PAYMENT OF RENT FOR NON PAYMENT OKAY CLEAR THANK YOU AND- MY SECOND QUESTION I HAD REYES THIS. WHEN THE IDEA FIRST CAME OUT WHICH I THINK IS. GOOD TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF PAYMENT OF RENT BECAUSE- OF THEIR BODY HAS SAID. YOU KNOW IT CAN ACCUMULATE VERY QUICKLY AND SO WE'RE GOING TO BE FACING THAT SIZE IS GLAD TO SEE THIS. I WAS CONCERNED AND I STILL AM ABOUT. THE DEBT FOLLOWING AS A BAD CREDIT ITEM AND I UNDERSTAND FOR MEETING. HERE THE ANALYSIS THE BILL DIRECTS THE FTP TO COLLECT- ANY UNPAID AMOUNTS SIMILAR TO OTHER TAX DEBTS INCLUDING LEANS AND LEVEES SO SINCE THAT IT FALLS UNDER THAT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT AGAIN THIS POOR PEOPLE FOR THE MOST PART YOU KNOW PEOPLE OF COLOR- MAYBE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SERVICES BUT HOW DO THEY DEAL WITH THIS SORT OF DEBT RELIEF FOLLOWING THEM IN A NEGATIVE WAY VERSES. THIS IS OPPORTUNITY GOOD STATE TO IN THE STATE AND THE TENANT I DON'T KNOW I WANT TO HEAR AN ANSWER. AND EXCELLENT QUESTION SO- LET'S ASSUME THAT THE TENANT- OWES RENT. AND TO THE LANDLORD. AND THEY DON'T HAVE A WAY TO BE ABLE TO PAY THAT BACK RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY OR THEY'RE NOT WORKING THAT DEBT WILL FOLLOW THEM FOR EVER IF THEY EVENTUALLY LEAVE OR IF THE- THE- THEY DON'T TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT. THEY WILL HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING ANOTHER APARTMENT BECAUSE THAT THAT WILL FOLLOW THEM. SO WITH THIS PROCESS ENVISIONS IS IF THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE RENTAL AGREEMENT THE DEBT THEN BE BECOMES A DEBT OF THE STATE. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS IF THE INDIVIDUAL IS EARNING A HUNDRED AND 50% OF THE MEDIAN INCOME. YEAH TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THEN THEY'RE EXPECTED TO START PAYING THAT DEBT BACK. AND THE F. T. B. WELL COLLECTED JUST LIKE ANY OTHER DEBT THAT'S BOWED TO FTP. WHICH MEANS IT'S A PAYMENT PLAN RIGHT. IF THEY EARN BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND A HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE PERCENT. BEN IT'S A 75% REPAYMENT AND AGAIN IT'S OVER TEN YEARS. AND IT'S WITH NO INTEREST AND THERE SO THERE'S NO PENALTIES ON IT AT THAT POINT. IF THEY EARN BETWEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND NINETY NINE PERCENT. THEN THEY PAY 50% AND IF THEY. EARN 75% OR BELOW THERE'S NO REPAYMENT BUT THIS DEPENDS ON WHAT THEY'RE EARNING AT THE YEAR THAT THE OBLIGATION TO PAY START. SO TO BE REALLY FRANK ABOUT IT. IT'S PROBABLY MORE PROBABLE THAT THE POOREST PEOPLE WILL HAVE THE HARDEST TIME MAKING THE RENT PAYMENTS. AND THAT'S WHO WILL END UP IN THE PROGRAM AND WHOSE DEATH WILL BE FORGIVEN. IF THEY'RE STILL NOT EARNING. THE MEDIAN INCOME. IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. OKAY SO IT IS AN INVESTMENT BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA JUST TO BE CLEAR. IN STABILIZE THE HOUSING MARKET SO THAT PEOPLE CAN STAY IN THEIR IN THEIR RESIDENCES ARE IN THE UNITS THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE RENTING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US NOT TO END UP WITH. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES HOMELESS. SO FOR THE ANSWERS. I WOULD CONTINUE TO URGE THE ISSUE OF WAGE GARNISHMENT A LEVEES LEVI'S BECAUSE I REALLY- I'M CONCERNED THAT THAT BECOMES A STAIN ON THE ON THE CREDIT FOR ON THEIR HISTORY SO WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO CENTER JONES. YEAH I WANT TO THANK OUR OUR GOOD CALLING FROM LOS ANGELES SHE ASKED A VERY GOOD SERIES OF QUESTIONS SOME OF WHICH- I HAD THE SAME CONCERNS AND I DO HAVE- TO ADDITIONAL CONCERNS MADAM PRESIDENT IF I MAY ASK- TWO QUESTIONS ON TWO DIFFERENT TOPICS IF. YOU'RE WITTY THE QUESTIONS YES PLEASE PROCEED AND I'LL ASK HIM IN ONE STATEMENT SO YOU CAN ADDRESS SOME- THERE'S SOME CONCERNS IT YEAH THIS IS A VERY AMBITIOUS- GOAL TIME. TO FIX THIS PART OF THE MARKET THAT'S BEEN KIND OF- MESSED UP IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO THE COVE IN NINETEEN STUFF- SO TO. CONCERNS OF THE BILL AS IN PRINT ONE THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS THAT IT VIOLATES THE CONTRACTS CLAUSE OF THE U. S. CONSTITUTION AT BECAUSE OF THE RETROACTIVITY OF IT. ALSO IS THE STATE IS INTERFERING WITH A CONTRACT. BEEN SIGNED IN AND PROPERLY EXECUTED BY TWO PARTIES. AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS THE ACTUAL PROCESS OF. EXCHANGING THESE MARKETABLE- TAX CREDITS- I UNDERSTAND THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IS NOT COMPLETELY GOT THAT IRONED OUT OR HOW OR- MAYBE NOT EVEN AGREED TO PART. TO PAY. SO IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THOSE TWO CANS THAT CREATES CONSTITUTIONALITY AND THE PROCESS. IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THOSE QUESTIONS SO- IN REGARDS TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS QUITE FRANKLY- THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM NEITHER PARTY NEEDS. TO AGREE TO IT. BUT THE A BY SOME CONDITIONS FOLLOW FROM IT THE- GOVERNOR HAS ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH- PROVIDES THAT EVICTIONS CANNOT OCCUR DURING THIS PANDEMIC IN ITS WITHIN HIS AUTHORITY TO DO THAT- THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAS ALSO WEIGHED IN AND HAS SAID- NOT ONLY CAN YOU NOT A VICTORY IN THE TIME ON. THAT IS THAT IT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE GOVERNOR AND HE IS EXTENDED BY THE WAY I BELIEVE THE END OF JULY. BUT IT AFTER AFTER THAT THEY WILL NOT BE TAKING. AT THE PAY WORK FOR EVICTIONS AND SO WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE- BECAUSE OF THE AUTHORITY. THAT IS GIVEN TO THE GOVERNOR DURING. A PANDEMIC. ON THOSE. THAT SITUATION IS IN PLACE RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO COME IN AND TO SAY SO WHEN THAT ALL IS DONE. WHEN IT'S FINISHED WITH. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAVE. THOUSANDS OF SMALL. LANDLORDS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN GETTING FULL PAYMENTS. AND THAT ARE AT RISK OF FORECLOSURE AND MAY LOSE. THERE ARE THEIR PROPERTIES AND THOUSANDS OF TENANTS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TENANTS WHO WOULD BE. AT RISK OF EVICTION AND IF THAT HAPPENS WOULD HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME FINDING A LANDLORD TO RENT TO THEM BECAUSE THEY JUST GOT EVICTED AND SO THEN YOU KNOW THEY DON'T THEY THEY DIDN'T PAY THE RENT SO WHAT THIS DOES IS IT SETS UP AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LANDLORD AND THE TENANT. TO VOTE BOTH VOLUNTARILY AGREE THAT THIS IS A PROCESS THAT THEY WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN AND THEY VOLUNTARILY. THROUGH THE RACKS. ASIAN CONDITION. TRUCKS A DAY BEEN INVOLVED IN. SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE CONSTITUTIONAL. MY% VERY SIMPLE CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS- THEN AND THEN THE SECOND ONE IS THE PROSPECTS TO EXCHANGE THE TAX CREDITS. THAT THAT WERE WORKING ON BUT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD BY. THE FINANCIAL EXPERTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO PROBE THIS QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE THIS IS KEY TO THE WHOLE. THING WORKING IS THAT THOSE TAX CREDITS HAVE MONETARY VALUE NOW YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR IF YOU SELL IT THE MARKET TODAY. BUT IT WILL HAVE MORE. VALUE TO YOU- AT. RIGHT NOW IF YOU NEED IT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE YOUR MORTGAGE PAYMENT OR TO PAY. DEBTS THAT YOU HAD- AND IF YOU HOLD ON TO IT VALUE INCREASES OVER. SO LET BE ABLE TO MAKE TAT TO FOR THEM WITH THEY NEED CASH RIGHT NOW OR WHETHER THEY- THEY- WANT TO SAVE IT AND USE IT IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU ARE ON MY OWN TIME AND PRESENT SO I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE PROCESS WITH THE- ANTI TAX BUT HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETELY IRONED OUT AND THEY'RE STILL WORKING ON THAT- AND THEN REGARDING THE VOLUNTARY- WE'VE HEARD SEVERAL TIMES. IN ANSWERS EVEN- SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE ARE GOOD CALLING YOU- FROM AT LOS ANGELES WAS ASKING. IN THE% ANSWER WERE HEARING THAT IT'S VOLUNTARY BUT WE'RE ALSO HEARING AT THE SAME TIME THAT IT'S- REALLY THE VOLUNTARY IS ONE WAY- OF. THE RENTER- YOU CAN VOLUNTEER FOR PROGRAM. AND THEN THE AMERICAN SAY YES OR NO THEY'RE GONNA VOLUNTEER. BUT EVEN IF THE LANDLORD DOESN'T VOLUNTEER UNLAWFUL DETAINER IS TO RESTRICT. SO THE LANDLORD REALLY DOESN'T HAVE A VOLUNTARY SITUATION HERE. IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT A REAL. A REAL CONCERN IN CALIFORNIA WITH THIS RENTAL MARKET. IT'S A SIMPLE. PROBLEM RANGERS CAN'T PAY RENT. AND BUT IT'S CAUSED BY THE- POLICIES THAT THIS GOVERNMENT LAID OUT IN MARCH. THAT TOO BECAUSE IT IS IT IT'S A TEMPORARY IT'S A TEMPORARY CHALLENGES AND PROBLEMS. MEANING THE ECONOMY IS COMING BACK SLOWLY BUT IT IS COMING BACK EVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA WORKERS ARE GOING BACK TO WORK. THEY'RE GONNA GET CAUGHT UP THERE- WE'RE HEARING ALREADY FROM A LOT OF. IF RENTAL ADVOCATES AND LANDLORD ASSOCIATIONS AND OTHER PEOPLE TO DEAL IN THAT MARKET THAT REALLY THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE NOT STOPPED PAYING RENT- COMPLETELY SOME HAVE REDUCE THEIR ABILITY TO PAY RENT BUT YEAH I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO GET CAUGHT UP AND I THINK THE MARKET. AND THE AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LANDLORD AND THE TENANT IN THOSE CASES CAN MAKE UP THERE ALL IN ALL IN MOST OF THE CASES. THE LANDLORD AND THE TENANT ARE GONNA BE ABLE WORK THIS OUT WITHOUT US INTERFERING WITH THAT RELATIONSHIP THE I DO. COMMAND THE AUTHORS THAT THIS IS A VERY AMBITIOUS- SIX YEAH IT'S VERY CREATIVE. AND PROBABLY SOMETHING WE'VE NOT SEEN CERTAINLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA OR ANY OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY. THE PROBLEM IS IT'S VERY COMPLICATED AND CONVOLUTED. AS WE'RE ALREADY HEARING FROM THE DEBATE THIS THIS MORNING THERE'S A LOT OF LOOSE ENDS IN THIS BILL. A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE COMPLETELY STILL NOT FIGURED OUT- I'M NOT SURE THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS OF THE BILL HAVE BEEN- COMPLETELY ADDRESS I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR- YOU KNOW LETTING US KNOW THE CURRENT STATUS OF THAT SITUATION. AND YOU KNOW. WE GOT A TEMPORARY. AT THE STATE NOW IS GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN FOR THE NEXT TWELVE TO FOURTEEN YEARS- TRYING TO SOLVE IT. AS PEOPLE FIGURE OUT THESE MARKETABLE. TAX FREE TAX CREDITS OR WHATEVER WOULD CALL IN AND- PLEASE DON'T I JUST THINK IT'S A GOES TOO FAR DOES TOO MUCH IS NOT FIGURE OUT ENOUGH TO ME LOOSENS ASK FOR NO VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER JONES CENTER JACKSON. THANK YOU ARE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES ARE. I AM STILL HOPEFUL THAT WE ARE AT THE END OF THIS CRISIS AS MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO- POSITS BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT IN LOOKING AT THE DAILY NUMBERS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF CALIFORNIA THE NOTION THAT WE ARE OVER THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS. THIS PROBLEM IS GOING TO CONTINUE UNTIL WE HAVE A CURE. A TREATMENT OR VACCINE NONE OF WHICH SEEM TO BE ON THE HORIZON SO AN ISSUE LIKE THIS ACTUALLY DOES HAVE VALUE AND I WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO PUT TOGETHER THIS VERY UNUSUAL AND I THINK ELEGANT SOLUTION. I DO HAVE CONCERNS THOUGH BECAUSE IT IS A NEW CONCEPT THE NOTION OFGOING TILL TWENTY THIRTY FIVE I THINK IS AN LEASE FOR ME. A DEAL BREAKER GOING FORWARD I THINK THAT'S WAY WAY WAY TOO MUCH TIME SO MUCH CAN HAPPEN- BUT I DO THINK THAT WE ARE ON THE RIGHT PATH. AND SO I WILL SUPPORT THIS EFFORT TODAY- I DO THINK WE NEED TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT IS TRANSPIRING WE'RE ALL HOPING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S GONNA STEP UP WITH CARES TO WORST MOTHER. GRAHAM BECAUSE WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF MONEY HERE AND PEOPLE ARE MAYBE GO TO SUMMER GOING BACK TO WORK BUT IF THIS TREND CONTINUES HEARING CALIFORNIA. IT WOULD BE MY- THAT WE WILL PULL BACK. BECAUSE OUR NUMBER. PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW INFECTED AND ARE GOING TO THE HOSPITAL IN A REAL NICE TO YOU AND ARE POTENTIALLY- THREATENED WITH THEIR LIVES IS INCREASING. DRAMATICALLY AND SO TO THINK THAT WE ARE AT THE END OF THIS IS TRUST ABSOLUTELY MIND BOGGLING TO ME. AND I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES. AND AT THE SAME TIME RECOGNIZED ARE A LOT OF LANDLORDS OUT THERE. WHO ARE NOT BIG LANDLORDS THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT OWN A DUPLEX OR INHERITED SOMETHING THAT THEY NOW RENT OUT AND I HAVEN'T HEARD YET A DISCUSSION THAT SHOWS THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE ANY KIND OF MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE BECAUSE THAT'S SORT OF THE OTHER PART OF THIS. MORTGAGES ARE UNDER FEDERAL CONTROL AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH MOVEMENT THERE. BUT I DO WANT TO EXPRESS MY THANKS FOR THIS THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX BUT ALSO MY CONCERN GRANTED IT'S A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. BUT WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ON BOTH SIDES WHEN THIS PANDEMIC IS GOING TO END WE DO NOT KNOW IT IS BLOWING UP IN OUR FACES HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. BUT WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO STOP THEIR HOME SO I COMMEND THE F. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING. THIS MOVIE GOING FORWARD BUT WANT TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS- IN IN EXPECTATIONS- THAT THERE'S A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. THANK YOU A MAN PRESENT THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON CENTER BORDERS. THANK YOU I AGREE WITH. MY COLLEAGUE FROM. SANTA BARBARA THAT THERE ARE THREE PARTIES IN THAT A PART OF THIS DYNAMIC GET YOUR RENTER'S YOUR LANDLORDS HERE LENDERS. THIS IS DEALING PRINCIPALLY WITH THE FIRST TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE SECOND. NOT BE ABLE TO AT THIS POINT ADDRESSED THE THIRD. A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT I'M TRYING TO WALK THROUGH THIS SO. WE HAVE A LANDLORD. WHO HAS TENANTS IN THE TENANTS ARE NOT PAYING. SALANDER MUST FRONT LOAD THE VALUE OF THE RENT TO SATISFY HIS OR HER NOTE. I THINK WE'RE IN AGREEMENT WITH THAT. THE CREDIT WOULD NOT BE ON A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR BASIS. AND PRESUMABLY THE LANDLORD WOULD HAVE TO WAIT TO ACHIEVE THE TAX CREDIT UPON THE TAX RELEVANT TAX FILING PERIOD LET'S JUST SAY APRIL. SO THE LANDLORD CONCEIVABLY COULD BE FRONT LOADING THE FULL VALUE OF. THE RENT FOR THE PERIOD OF TIME AND UNTIL THE CREDIT IS ISSUED. AND THEN WE MOVE INTO THE CREDIT SCENARIO WHERE IT NOT ONLY WAS IT NOT DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR BUT IF THE LANDLORD THEN WANTS TO FLOATED. BACK CREDIT ON THE MARKET TREATED AS PAPER AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. WHOEVER Y PURCHASE IT. IS GOING TO WANT A PROFIT SO LET'S SAY IT'S TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR CREDIT. IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE FLOOD ON THE MARKET FOR SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THAT FOR SOMEONE TO WANT TO BUY IT. SO THE LAND IS LOSING THE RENT FOR A YEAR NOT ALL AND NOT ON A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR BASIS IS GETTING A CREDIT AND WHEN THEY FLOATED ON THE MARKET. THEY'RE GONNA AT THE PLATE PAY A PREMIUM FOR TO BE PURCHASED. ARE THESE REASONABLE REPRESENTATIONS OF THIS DYNAMIC SO FAR. IS A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. WE KNOW IT UP. ALL WITHDRAW THAT I THINK THE I THINK THEY ARE REASONABLE. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. AM I GUESS AND MY QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR IS THIS THROUGH THE CHAIRED BY MAY. WIN WOULD WE BE ABLE TO GET THE SPECIFICS ON HOW EXACTLY DOES WORKS THAT. IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO MOVE ON THIS. SENATE HAVE AIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION IN IN THE PROBLEM WITH YOUR COMPOUND. QUESTION BUT YOU HAD SOME PARTS OF IT WRONG THIS IS A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR CREDIT. WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ENTER INTO THE AGREEMENT IT'LL BE A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR CREDIT WHETHER YOU DECIDE TO SELL IT ON THE MARKET OR NOT- AND WHAT YOU CAN GET FOR IT WILL DEPEND ON THE MARKET. AND SO IF YOU IF YOU HOLD ON. THEN YOU GET IT YOU CAN USE IN THE FUTURE THAT MEANS YOU'VE GOT THE FINANCIAL ABILITY TO DO THAT. BUT IF YOU CAN'T AND YOU NEED SOME CASH NOW YOU SELL IT AND ON AND RECEIVED A CASH BUT THEN YOU'RE AT THE RISK OF THE MARKET JUST JUST LIKE ANY OTHER PAPER CREDIT. FOR PROBLEM PATIENT. WORKING I'M THROUGH THE TECHNICALITY AND IT WE JUST SOME TIME DO IT AND SO WHEN WILL WE HAVE THAT PROBABLY OVER THE BREAK WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON THIS AND OBVIOUSLY REALLY NEED TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SECOND HOUSE GONNA WANT ANSWERS THEY'RE NOT BACK. TILL THE END OF THE MONTH SO- THEORETICALLY WE HAVE A MONTH TO DO IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS ADMIRABLE THIS IS NOT EASY IN NINETEEN YOU KNOW WANT TO GIVE YOUR A PLOT IN CENTERED AS WELL IN ORDER TO. EASY TO FIGURE OUT THANK YOU THINK THE REPORTERS JONES. FIVE ONE OF THE COMMENTS IN THAT THE- ARE ARE. CALLING FROM BARBARA OUT I NEED MEAN TO COMMUNICATE THAT. I FEEL LIKE WE'RE OUT OF THIS THE ENDING I HAD A COUPLE OTHER MEMBERS OFF THE FLOOR. SAY THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT I SAID TO SO. NO I DON'T THINK WE'RE OUT OF THE KOBE SITUATION AT ALL- AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE'RE GOING TO BE IN THIS SITUATION I DIDN'T MEAN BY SAYING TEMPORARY. WAS THAT IN RELATION TO THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THIS BILL PROPOSES TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. TEMPORARY AND AT SOME POINT TIME I THINK SOON BECAUSE- MEMBERS THE INCIDENT WILL BE BACK WITH THE PEOPLE ARE GOING BACK TO WORK NOW. AND MORE MORE PEOPLE AS WE PROCEED WILL BE GOING BACK TO WORK AND WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT SO YOU. THANK YOU CENTER JONES MEMBERS SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE THERE CABALLERO YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMBERS FOR THIS- THIS REALLY ROBUST DEBATE I'VE I APPRECIATED VERY MUCH LET ME JUST GIVE YOU. SOME NUMBERS THAT THAT WE GOT FROM- AND THE DAM I HAVE WAY TOO MANY NUMBERS HERE BUT SOME NUMBERS IN REGARDS TO THE- WHAT TENANTS ARE DOING NATIONWIDE AND- IT'S HARD TO GET THIS. REAL TIME. BUT THE ACCORDING TO INFORMATION. THE MONTHLY NATCHER NATIONAL SURVEY. ON ONLINE RENTAL MARKET PLACE- IN APRIL. 24% OF THE TENANTS FAILED TO PAY ON TIME IN THIS COURSE IS THESE ARE THE LANDLORDS REPORTING INFORMATION TWELVE MADE NO PAYMENT AND A PARTIAL PAYMENT IN MAY IT INCREASED 31% FAILED TO PAY ON TIME. 22% MADE NO PAYMENT AND WHAT THE SHOWS IS THAT T EVERY MONTH IT'S GETTING A LITTLE TOUGHER IN JUNE. 31% PER TO FAILED TO PAY ON ON TIME 19% PAYMENT AND 11% PARTIAL PAYMENTS WE HAVE TEN SO BETTER TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING THEYJUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY AND WE HAVE. AN LORD ALLOWING TENANTS TO MAKE PARTIAL PAYMENTS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IT'S A TOUGH TIME AND IT'S BETTER TO PART OF THE MONEY IN HAPPEN. WHAT IS IT. IT'S GOING TO TAKE AWHILE TO RESULT ITSELF THIS PANDEMIC IS NOW GOING AWAY QUICKLY. AND THE DANISH. AS MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SANTA BARBARA SAID THAT WERE THAT THE NUMBERS ARE ON THE RISE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ENGAGING IN ARE VERY VERY DANGEROUS AND ARE LEADING. TO THE SPREAD OF THE OF THE VIRUS IN EXPONENTIALLY AND SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT. WHEN WE RECESS IN AUGUST WERE NOT GOING TO BE THROUGH ALL OF THIS AND WE NEED TO HAVE A SOLUTION THAT'S GOING TO HELP. TO STABILIZE THE RENTAL MARKET TO HELP TENANTS AND TO HELP LANDLORDS AT THE SAME TIME. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK. THERE'S JUST ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION ABOUT IT BUT I WANT TO THANK. THE WISE HEADS. IN THIS ECONOMIC STIRBT STABILITY GROUP FOR COMING UP WITH SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS REALLY INNOVATIVE AND IF WE DO IT RIGHT COULD MAKE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE. IN OUR IN OUR HOUSING CRISIS WHICH WE FACED EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. AND MAY AND REALLY WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO HELP US. TO RECOVER FROM THIS PANDEMIC SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE VOTE TODAY TO ALLOW US TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR TO COVER I THINK HONESTY BRADFORD WAS ALSO CONCLUDED THAT GOES WITH YOU CENTER BRADFORD YES I JUST WANT TO ADD MY VOICE WANTED THAT. CALLER FROM SALON DOES THE JOINT AUTHORS THIS THING. AND MEMBERS YOU'RE RIGHT THIS IS A COMPLICATED. ISSUE WE'RE NOT GONNA CANDY COAT THIS AND SAY THAT WE HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS HERE. BUT I WANT YOU TO CONSIDER ONE THING WHAT IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THIS PROGRAM. WHAT IF WE CAN TRY TO PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER IT'S TWO THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BE GUARANTEED IF. AND FORECLOSURES WE SAW THAT TWELVE YEARS AGO DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION HERE AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND WE SAW THE NUMBER OF ADDICTIONS AND OF NUMBER FOR CLOSURES THAT HAPPEN. THIS IS A PLAN TO FIGHT AS WHOLE BUT- THE STATE THAT ALL. THE REASON WHY IT'S STILL SO MANY MOVING PARTS YEAH STATE IN AS OUR STATED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS DESCRIPTION WERE HOPING WE DON'T HAVE TO USE THIS. BUT THERE THIS IS THE EIGHT FIFTY ACT. TO PROTECT NOT ALL CAN. AND THE LAND IT'S A- I CAN UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN. AT LEAST. TAX CREDITS WILL WORK BUT AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT YOU HAVE ONE THING FOR SURE THAT LANDLORDS WILL BE IN FINANCIAL TROUBLE THIS GUARANTEES HERE SHE SOME KIND OF FINANCIAL SECURITY MOVING FORWARD AGAIN THIS IS NOT EXCUSE EIGHT TENANTS FROM PAYING THE RENT WE'RE GOING TO ENCOURAGE BILLS STAND IT YU CAN PAY IF NOT A 100% OF THE RENT SOME PORTION OF THEIR RANK. SO THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE A SAFETY NET FOR BOTH THE TAP- TENANTS AND LANDLORDS IT'S A WORKING PRODUCT PROGRESS WITH AS MY COLLEAGUES STATED AS WE STATED IN A WORKING GROUP THE WORKING POOR PERSON WE'RE COMMITTED TO GET THIS RIGHT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR RIVAL. SAID REMEMBER TO BE CLEAR THEY ARE JOINED. THAT IS WHY THEY BOTH CLOSED MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALLEN I ARCHULETA I ATKINS. BATES NO WELL I FOR JUST. BRADFORD I HAVE A I CHIANG.

SENATE BILL TEN EIGHTY FIVE BY SENATOR SKINNER AND ACTUALLY DID A HOUSING CENTERS CAN. THANK. YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. MY GLASSES ON AND LET THEM FOG UP THE- CALIFORNIA'S DENSITY BONUS LAW WAS THREE IT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT TOOL THAT THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED TO HELP INCENTIVIZE MARKET RATE HOUSING PROJECTS TO INCLUDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. NOW IT'S A VERY GOOD LAWN AN IMPORTANT LAW BUT IT IS NOT BEING USED AS EXTENSIVELY AS CLEARLY THE INTENT WAS LESS THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE APPROVED PROJECTS THAT UTILIZE THE DENSITY BONUS END OF THOSE THAT HAVE THERE'S ONLY BEEN ONE OR TWO PROJECTS WITHIN THOSE JURISDICTIONS. THE OBSTACLES INCLUDE THAT INCLUSIONARY RULES THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE ALSO ADOPTED DON'T ALWAYS SEE WITH THE DENSITY BONUS LAW WHICH THEN LEAVES BUILDERS OPTING NOT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DENSITY BONUS AND THEY END UP BUILDING THEIR PROJECT ONLY WITH MARKET RATE UNITS. THE PURPOSE OF SB TEN EIGHTY FIVE IS TO IMPROVE OUR DENSITY BONUS LAW SO THAT WE ACTUALLY INCREASE ITS USE AND MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS GET BUILT. SO WHAT SB TEN EIGHTY FIVE DOES IS IT MODIFIES THE DENSITY BONUS SO THAT IN THE HIGH COST HOUSING AREAS LIKE THE BAY AREA. IT CAN BENEFIT MIDDLE INCOME RESIDENTS WHO LITERALLY CANNOT AFFORD EITHER RENTAL OR PURCHASE UNITS IN THAT AREA ART MIGHT. IT ALSO INCREASES THE ALLOWABLE DENSITY BONUS FOR THE VERY LOW INCOME UNITS FROM 35% TO FORTY PERCENT. BANDED INSURERS THAT IF A PROJECT AFFORDS ITSELF OF THE DENSITY BONUS. IT DOES NOT IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS A FORD A HOUSING IMPACT FEE THAT THAT IMPACT FEE IS NOT CHARGED ON THE AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT THE PROJECT INCLUDES BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO DOUBLE COUNTY. IT ADDITIONALLY HELPS INSURERS THAT DENSITY BONUS CAN BE USED FOR STUDENT HOUSING PROJECTS AND I THINK THAT WE OF ALL. EXPERIENCED AND SEEN THE DATA ON HOW- HOUSING CHALLENGE STUDENTS ARE ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND HOW MAY WE ARE NOW FINDING LIVING IN VEHICLES NINE FORTY B. AND FOR ONLY.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TO PRESENT SB ELEVEN ZERO THREE RELATED TO INCREASING LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS ACCESS TO HOPE HI ROADS JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS. THIS BILL WILL ACQIRE THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD TO SUPPORT LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS COMPLETING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TRAINING PROGRAMS. THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE BOARD TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT PARTNERSHIPS TO ADDRESS DISPLACEMENT OF WORKERS INCLUDING FARMWORKERS. DISCONNECTED YOUTH AND YOUTH AT RISK DESCRIPTION FROM EMPLOYMENT. DURING. OUR CURRENT RECESSION IT IS CHRIS. WE LEARN FROM OUR LAST RECESSION DOUBLE DOUBLE COMMUNITIES ARE THE FIRST BECOME UNEMPLOYED. WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS HAVE A PROVEN IMPACT ON APPROVING UPWARD MOBILITY AND ALSO INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY WHEN THEY BECOME ADULTS. HOWEVER ACROSS CALIFORNIA MANY WORKFORCE TWENTY PARTICIPANTS ARE NOT ABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS DIGITAL A LACK OF AFFORDABLE TRANSPORTATION OR LACK OF AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE. I'VE SEEN THIS FIRSTHAND. TEEN MOTHERS STRUGGLING TO PURCHASE FORMULA FOR THE BABIES. AND WORKERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE PRIORITIZING THESE POPULATIONS DURING THE CURRENT RECESSION WILL HELP LIFT FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY AND INTO PROSPERITY AND IT STARTS HERE WHAT SB ELEVEN ZERO THREE. AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN MEDI NARAL THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM TO THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD ALLOW FOR LEHMAN OF HIGH ROADS TRAINING PROGRAM PARTNERSHIPS TO LINE WITH LOCAL REGIONAL LABOR MARKET DEMANDS. AND INCLUDE CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS TO ALLOW CONSIDERATION OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND QUALIFIED OPPORTUNITIES OWNS. NOW MORE THAN EVER DURING  PANDEMIC INDUCED RECESSION SB ELEVEN ZERO THREE WILL HELP PROVIDE IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE TO UNEMPLOYED AND UNDEREMPLOYED WORKERS TO PURSUE JOB TRAINING.

FOR OUR FRONTLINE WORKERS FIGHTING COVERT NINETEEN AS WE ARE ALL PAINFULLY AWARE COVER NINETEEN HAS RAVAGED OUR STATE. WELL MUCH MEDIA ATTENTION HAS BEEN ON THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES OF THIS PANDEMIC THE SCALE OF HUMAN SUFFERING IS UNPRECEDENTED AND DIFFICULT TO OVERSTATE. THIS IS WHY I TEAMED WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER TOM DALY CHAIR OF THE IN. COMMITTEE TO AUTHOR A WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTION COVERT NINETEEN BILL. THIS BILL WILL EXTEND A COVERT NINETEEN REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION TO BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR WORKERS CURRENTLY. AS WRITTEN THE BILL CODIFIES THE GOVERNOR'S RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDER ON COVERT NINETEEN AND WORKERS COMPENSATION. IN THE WEEKS TO COME OUR OFFICES WILL WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR DRESSING WORKERS COMPENSATION. AND COVERT NINETEEN FOR THE FUTURE THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION AND I HAVE THREE RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR HILL MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE SITTING IN HERE YES OKAY I'VE GOT SENATOR DOLLY AND THEN CENTER MORE LAW CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- WHEN NO GOVERNOR THE GOVERNOR ISSUED THE- EXECUTIVE ORDER IN SIXTY TWO TWENTY- MY EMAIL BOX WITH UP BUSINESSES WERE OPERATION WE SHOULD BE TO EMPLOYERS CANNOT BE AND SHOULD NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR WHAT THEIR EMPLOYEES MAYBE DOING OUTSIDE OF THE JOB. THAT MAY HAVE ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTED TO TESTING THE FOR THE COR VIRUS- EXAM WE JUST HAD AN EXAMPLE OF A TENNIS PLAYER WHO CONTRACTED. OVER NINETEEN BUT WE HAVE LOTS OF VIDEO BAR HOPPING AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT ARE LONG AND FAR AWAY FROM THE REVIEW OF. A PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT AND SO FOR THIS REASON- I OPPOSE THIS PRESUMPTIVE- THIS PRESUMPTION- ON EMPLOYERS MASS FOR NO VOTE ON SB ELEVEN FIFTY NINE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU CENTER MORE LOT. SENATE OLLIE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I ALSO RISE IN OPPOSITION YOU KNOW THIS IS A- A BIG REACH FOR THE GOVERNOR TO USE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. TWO METAL IN WORKERS COMP I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU THERE WAS A TIME IN MY BUSINESS THAT I PAID FORTY TWO CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR. I PAID TO AN EMPLOYEE FOR WORKERS COMP AND NEVER HAD A SINGLE CASE. FILED AGAINST MY BUSINESS. QUITE FRANKLY WAS BECAUSE I OWNED CATTLE. AND CATTLE FOR SOME REASON DRIVE YOUR WORKERS COMP UP. AND SO AFTER WE FIGURED OUT THE AMOUNT THAT THE CATTLE OR CAUSES WE GOT ALL THE CATTLE BUSINESS. AND WE DROPPED OUR WORKERS COMP TO ABOUT TWELVE CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE PAID OUR EMPLOYEES. NOW THOSE SCENARIOS ARE SET IN PLACE BECAUSE THERE'S RISK AND THE RISK IS SET BY THE AMOUNT OF THE AMOUNT IS SET BY THE RISK IN THIS CASE THERE HAS TO BE PROOF OF WHERE THE RISK IS WHERE'S THE WRIST THE WRIST IS IT IS IT MY JOB OR IS IT WHERE THE EMPLOYEE TAX COVE IT. WHAT'S SAYING IS SENSUALLY HERE IS THAT. NO MATTER WHAT. NO MATTER WHERE YOU CONTACTED OR YOU ARE YOU GET SICK YOU'RE GOING TO PUT IT OFF ON THE EMPLOYER. IT'S GOING TO DRIVE A THAT'S A COST OF DOING BUSINESS IS GOING TO DRIVE UP HERE. THE PROOF. THE CONTACT JUST LIKE YOU WOULD WITH ANY OTHER CASE THAT YOU WOULD BE FILED AGAINST YOUR BUSINESS. FOR THE RISK OF. OF A OF THE JOB THAT YOU DO. SO ARBITRARILY LETTING THE GOVERNOR DO EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PUT ANOTHER COSTS ON TO MY BUSINESS AND YOU CAN'T BROUGH. WHERE THAT RISK IS JUST ABSURD. AND WE SHOULD NOT BE VOTING TO RATIFY THIS IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION FOR THOSE REASONS I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING NONE CENTER HELD ME CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THIS IS THE GOVERNOR'S. THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER REVOLVED AROUND THOSE HIGH RISK WORKERS- WE'RE SOCIAL DISTANCING IS PRETTY MUCH IMPOSSIBLE THOSE POLICE OFFICERS FIREFIGHTERS NURSES. WITH WAREHOUSE WORKERS AND OTHERS AS THE CENTRAL WORKERS THAT WOULD HAVE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION. AND FOR THEM THE PURPOSE OF THIS LEGISLATION IS TO WORK WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP AND CRAFT. A MEASURE THAT ILL BE LIMITED AND IT WILL BE SUNSET IN AT SOME POINT IN TIME IN THE FUTURE BUT IT'S NECESSARY. THAT WE PROTECT THOSE WORKERS WHOSE WORKERS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO OUR ECONOMY ESSENTIAL TO OUR VERY EXISTENCE AS A STATE. THAT THEY ARE PROTECTED FROM THAT- THE INEVITABLE THAT MANY OF THEM ARE STRUGGLING WITH TODAY SO ASK FOR LIVE- COLLEAGUES AND THIS BILL WILL BE WORKED ON. LAND AREA AND WILL BE A OF A I THINK AND FEEL AT THE END OF THE DAY SOMETHING THAT WE WILL ALL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT.

FIVE TWENTY EIGHT NOS ELEVEN THE MEASURE PASSES MEMBERS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE BACK TO FILE ITEM TWENTY FOUR SENATOR BATES MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL THIRTEEN SEVENTY THREE BY SENATOR BATES AND ACTUALLY IN THE STATE HIGHWAYS SENATOR BATES THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT HI AND MEMBERS OF. BRING TO YOU A BILL THAT SEEKS TO MEMORIALIZE THE DECISION MADE BY THE TRANSPORTATION CORRIDOR BOARD ON MARCH TWELFTH TWENTY TWENTY BY DELETING AN ALIGNMENT OF STATE ROUTE TO FORTY ONE. LINE SOUTH OF SO PARKWAY AND EAST OF THE CITY OF MISSION VIEJO DOING MALES WILL PROMISE THAT IT WILL NOT RUN THROUGH THE CITY OF SAN CANADIAN APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN HUNDRED. ACRES OF FEDERALLY AND CITY PROTECT OPEN SPACE. BUT BEFORE I CONTINUE ON MEMBERS I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT SHOULD THIS BILL MOVED TO THE ASSEMBLY I DO INTEND TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THE TENTH TRANSPORTATION BORDER AGENCY. CAN ACT DEVELOP IMPACT FEES WHICH WILL PROVIDE THE- THREE AND THAT IS S. TO CONTINUE THE PLOT TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. THE RELEASE. SENATE TRANSPORTATION CHAIR BY NOT TAKEN THESE. ARE ON THE SENATE FLOOR BUT INTO TAKE THEM AT THE-FIRST IN THE ASSEMBLY POLICY COMMITTEE. FOR HIS RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY CAN HAVE A FULL VETTING IN POLICY DISCUSSIONS TO VET THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED SINCE THIS. ALMOST UNANIMOUS VOTE IN THE SENATE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. THE BILL IS NECESSARY TO REMOVE FROM THE BOOKS A STATE HIGHWAY ALIGNMENT THAT STATE AND REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES HAVE DECIDED TO ABANDON. DUE TO ITS WAS DIPPING ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMIC CULTURAL AND SOCIETAL COSTS AND I'D LIKE. MADAM PRESIDENT FINE NAME. WITHOUT OBJECTION. THIS IS FROM THE PRESS RELEASE FROM THE TRANSPORTATION CORRIDOR AGENCIES FOLLOWING THEIR MARCH TWELFTH DECISION AFTER A ROBUST FOR YOUR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AFTER EFFORT WE ARE HAPPY WE HAVE A SOLUTION THAT REPRESENTS BOTH THE COMMUNITY'S INPUT IN TECHNICAL ANALYSIS. THE LOS PRODUCTOS PARKWAY EXTENSION WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT REGIONAL MOBILITY IMPROVEMENT SAID CRISTINA SHEA CHAIR WOMEN AND- MAYOR OF IRVINE ARE APPROVAL MEANS THAT ALL OTHER ALTERNATIVES INCLUDING ALL ROUTES THAT CONNECT DIRECTLY TO INTERSTATE FIVE ARE REMOVED FROM CONSIDERATION IT. IS TO C. A.'S EFFORT TO EXPAND THE TWO FORTY ONE TOLL ROAD. THE BILL IS NECESSARY TO MOVE FROM THE BOOKS THE STATE HIGHWAY ALIGNMENT THAT STATE AND REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION OR READ THAT SORRY BUT THE POINT IS THAT THE CURRENT ALIGNMENT FOR THE TWO FORTY ONE IS ABOUT FOUR MILES EAST. OF THE CITY OF SAN COMMITTEE IN IT WOULD TAKE STATE LEGISLATION TO MOVE IT BACK ANYWAY ALSO NOW IS THE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH CONTROVERSY SO MUCH STUDY ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS. SO THIS IS. CAN IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO REMOVE OUR- FROM OUR STATE OF ROADS AND HIGHWAYS- THIS ALIGNMENT CANNOT YOU WILL NOTICE IN YOUR ON. COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS IN MAY I READ THAT. WITHOUT OBJECTION ENACTING THIS PROPOSAL IN THE CURRENT LEGISLATIVE SESSION DOES NOT PROHIBIT FUTURE LEGISLATION FROM AGAIN ALTERING TO FORTY ONES BOUNDARIES WITHIN THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM AND THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED BECAUSE CURRENTLY THERE IS NO ONLINE AT THAT TRANSISTORS. ANTI THE GOOD NEWS IS THE- ARE DOES NOT PRECLUDE THE REGION FROM MOVING FORWARD WITH THE TRANSPORTATION CONGESTION ALTERNATIVES THAT HAVE WIDE SUPPORT- THAT. OF THE EXTENSION OF LOS FOR DRUMS PARKWAY THIS WAS ALL DECIDED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHY DO WE HAVE A STATE INVOLVEMENT CLEARLY ARE CALTRANS ACTUALLY WAS VERY MUCH A PART OF THIS EFFORT. IN MAY I READ AGAIN WITH THE- CAN FIND IT IN HERE. IT SAYS CALTRANS IN COORDINATION WITH FOOTHILL EASTERN TRANSPORTATION CORRIDOR HAS DECIDED TO DISCONTINUE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT CALTRANS IS THE NEED A LEAD AGENCY WILL THEREFORE NO LONGER ADVANCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT ON THE SOUTH COUNTY TRANSPORTATION FOR RELIEF EFFORTS TO SO SPECIFICALLY THE STATE IS STEPPING OUT AND I THINK THIS WILL CODIFY OR MEMORIAL BY STAFF. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTAN BUT WHAT DOES REMAIN IS WHAT DO WE DO TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE BILL THAT THEIR ISSUES ARE ARE TO BE ADDRESSED YOU ARE NOT FINANCIAL BUT TO DO THAT IN THE SENATE COMMITTEE OF TIME BECAUSE OF THOSE DO COME FORWARD TO STARTED TAKING A LOOK AT WHETHER WE WERE ACTUALLY GONNA HAVE THE FUNDING THAT SO IMPORTANT TO. MEET ON THE GLOBAL WERE SET WITH US SIGNIFICANT FOUR YEAR OF LOCAL INPUT THE STATE ENTER HERE AND IT IS THE ADDRESS WITH THIS I VERY VERY CA. TO CAN'T CONTINUE MY EFFORT TO IT POLICY ISSUES THREE I KNOW. BACK END TO BE APPRECIATED IF YOU COULD DO THAT THANK YOU MUCH- DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR BILL. THIS THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN. DISCUSS AND YOU KNOW AT DIFFERENT LEVELS IN- THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE I THINK FOR FIVE YEARS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND IT KEEPS BUBBLING UP. SO I'M PRETTY HAPPY. THAT THE GOOD SENATORS TO IS DECIDED TO. MEDIATE AND HELP WORK OUT AND WORK OUT A SOLUTION LET'S GIVE HER A CHANCE TO DO THAT. AND I ORIGINAL VOTE ON THIS SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS PROCEED IF IT IF SHE'S NOT SUCCESSFUL JUST GONNA COME BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN SO. I I'M PLEASE SHE'S GOING TO WORK WITH ALL HER COLLEAGUES- LET'S TRY TO GET THIS WORKED OUT. SO WE CAN COME UP WITH A GOOD SOLUTION STORAGE AND I VOTE ON THIS THANK YOU CENTER BILL CENTER MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT ALSO BEING OF. SENATOR FROM ORANGE COUNTY I LIKE TO PROVIDE A LITTLE COLOR OF CENTER FROM SANTA CLARA CERTAINLY ADDRESS ONE OF THE ISSUES AND IF. THE AUTHOR CAN FIX THIS PROBLEM THEN WILL EVER WORK WITH THE SUNNIS AND THE KURDS AND TAKE CARE OF THAT AND SO WELL BUT- THIS IS A ONE OF THOSE CLASSIC NAME BE BILLS- AND I'M JUST REALLY CONCERNED BECAUSE HE- AGENCY THAT. THIS BILL IS DIRECTED TOWARDS IS OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. ORANGE COUNTY HAS THIRTY FOUR CITIES ONLY ONE OBJECTS TO THE ROAD IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY BY RUNNING PLEA IT'S THE CITY THAT IS ASKED FOR THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION- SANTA MANY. AND SECOND MANY. ACTUALLY ACTUALLY NEEDS SOME KIND OF ROAD SYSTEM THE MOST OF OUR CITIES IN SOUTH COUNTY. WHEN THEN THE SUPERVISOR BATES TONIGHT SIR ON THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE WORKED. AGGRESSIVELY TO FIND ANOTHER REDUNDANT ROAD OUT OF SANTA MANY IF YOU IF YOU VISITS AND COMMITS A COASTAL TOWN THE FIVE FREEWAY GOES THROUGH IT- AND THAT'S THE ONLY. ROAD AT THE TO LEAD TIME IN AND OUT OF THAT PARTICULAR CITY. AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO WORK- TO EXTEND. LOW PADA ROAD WHICH DEADENDED BY ONE OF OUR MAJOR LANDFILLS AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO GO THROUGH OUR LANDFILL AND CONNECT SO. THE RESIDENTS OF SANTA MANY COULD HAVE A REDUNDANT WAY TO GET OUT OF THEIR CITY WHY WHY HAVE A REDUNDANT WAY TO GET OUT OF SAN COMMITTEE BECAUSE JUST SOUTH OF SAN FOR MANY- IS THE BORDER OF ORANGE COUNTY AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND AT THE VERY TOP OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY. THE BILL HE- US THE YES SENATE FREE NUCLEAR CHEN. STATION WE CALL IT SONGS AND IT HAS BEEN DE. BUT THE FUEL RODS ARE STILL THERE. SO IF THERE WOULD BE ANY KIND OF ACCIDENT WE HAD ONE ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO WERE ROD. FELL WHEN THEY WERE MOVING IT BUT IF WE HAD ANY KIND OF ACCIDENT OR TSUNAMI LIKE FUKUSHIMA. IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE RESIDENTS OF SANTA MANY. THEN STORMONT. RID THE TO HIGHWAYS TO ROW WILL ONE FREEWAY IN ONE ROAD TO GET OUT IN AN EMERGENCY. SO FOR CLOSING ON THE TWO FORTY ONE EXTENSION. YOU KNOW MAY REDUCE TRAFFIC NOISE FOR THE CITIZENS OF SAN COMMITTEE BUT IT COULD BE A DEATH KNELL IF THERE WERE REALLY A AN EMERGENCY. SO I DON'T MEAN TO BE AN ALARMIST BUT- YOU KNOW THE LAST FEW MONTHS NOTHING'S GONNA SURPRISE MANY MORE WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN. BUT COLLEGE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY ORANGE COUNTY OPPOSES THIS BILL- ED AND THIS. ALL THE CITY'S OPPOSE THIS BILL- AND I'M I'M JUST REALLY CONCERNED THAT. WE DON'T ENCOURAGE FRUSTRATED MUNICIPALITIES TO COME TO SACRAMENTO TO. SETTLE DISPUTES- WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE THE BUILDING MORE HOUSING- A COMPONENT OF THE STRATEGY IS TO DISCOURAGE NIMBY ISM AND APPROVING THIS BILL WOULD SEND A SIGNAL THAT MAYBE WE DON'T. SUPPORTING THIS NOT IN MY BACKYARD APPROACH SO COLLEAGUES BUT WE SHOULD NOT DO THINGS THE INDEPENDENT JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES AGENCIES THAT THEY ARE NOT ASKING FOR OR- FOR THAT THEY ACTUALLY OPPOSE. AND IN WITH THAT. THE KEEPING SHORT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. A NOBLE THANK YOU SENATOR MORE LIKE SENATOR GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THIS PUTS ME IN AN AWKWARD SITUATION IS I HAVE TO AMAZING A REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES THAT ARE BOTH FROM THE SAME AREA OF ORANGE COUNTY. BUT I DO KNOW THAT MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY AND THE SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER AMERICA'S IS COMMITTED TO WORKING FOR A SOLUTION. FOR THIS PROBLEM AS IS HER NATURE THAT WE KNOW SHE ALWAYS OPERATES IN THIRTY MINUTES COMMITTED TO HAVING HEARD IN THE SIMPLY POLICY COMMITTEE SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION CONCERNS REGARDING THE PLAN FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY IMPACT THESE TO COMPLETE THE TRANSPORTATION PROPERTY TRIED PROJECT IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THAT WILL RESULT. THESE ARE CONCERNS- THAT WERE RAISED AFTER THE BILL WAS FOR THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE ENTER DESERVING A FULL REVIEW WHICH HE HAS PLEDGED TO GIVE HER FULL DISCUSSION AND I JUST SAID IN MY OPENING REMARKS AND HER DEMEANOR IS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AS A LEADER EMERITUS REPUBLICAN AT HIS. THAT WAS OUR GOAL IS TO SEE BLOOM SO A I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL COME AND HELP ME SOLVE THE CITY IS WITH ON LET SHE. FOR MANY YEARS. DRESSED IN. AND I. THANK YOU SENATOR GROW MEMBER SEE NO TO OR DEBATE. SENATOR BAYH PLEASE CLICK CLOSE. LET ME RESPOND TO THE NIMBY COMMENT BECAUSE IT'S ABSURD THERE IS NOT A CURRENT ALIGNMENT THE TRANSVERSE AS SAN CLEMENTE TO DEVELOP ONE IS A HUGE PROCESS SAM COMMITTEE HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE LOWER PART EXTENSION THROUGH THEIR COMMUNITY BY WORKED ON THAT FOR THE ENTIRE EIGHT YEARS THAT I WAS ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. I SERVED ON THE TRANSPORTATION CORRIDOR AGENCY FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WE ATTEMPTED TO GET THE TWO FORTY ONE TO FOLLOW WHAT IS CURRENTLY IN THE STATE STREE FOR HIGHWAYS CODE WHERE IT- YET- IS ON THE EASTERN BOUNDARY OF UNINCORPORATED AREA OF ORANGE COUNTY THERE IS NOW AYE CONSERVATION EASEMENT. THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE TRANSPORTATION CORRIDOR AGENCY WHICH ESSENTIALLY BLOCKS- THE TWO FORTY ONE BREAKS DEAN SOUTH OF MANY WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN THE STATE STREET AND HIGHWAYS CODE SO WHAT THE PROCESS WOULD BE IS TO CREATE A NEW ALIGNMENT ATTACHING ATTY ITS TERMINUS NOW IT ALSO CAN BRING THAT THROUGH SAN CLEMENTE. ARE OPEN SPACE AND I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE FEDERAL OPEN SPACES PROTECTED THERE'S ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND SOME MAKERS THAT WAS A CAST IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE. THE ONE THAT IS CURRENTLY IN THAT PATHWAY IN OUR THANKS FOR MANY THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE NEW ALIGNMENT TO BE A DRIVEN THROUGH IT WAS PUT THERE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST HAPPENED LIKE ALL MY GOSH STOP. THEY HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH A PART OF THE TCA THEY HAVE BEEN ON THAT BOARD AND THEY VOTED FOR THIS PARTICULAR SOLUTION WHICH BY THE WAY IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IN TRANSPORTATION CONSCIOUS CONGESTION RELIEF FOR SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY THE BEEN NUMERAL TRAFFIC STUDIES TO PROVE THAT. THAT IS WHY THE BOARD VOTED TO MOVE OFF THE CURRENT ALIGNMENT AND MOVE OVER TO THE LOS FOR DRYNESS EXTENSION WHICH BY THE WAY CONNECTS TO BUKHARA WHICH TAKES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE I FIND. IN I CAN SHOW GOOD COLLEAGUES ORANGE COUNTY YOU'D LIKE LOOK AT THOSE TRAFFIC STUDY BECAUSE FRANKLY. THAT'S THE DAY THAT WE USE TO MAKE THE CITY. ON CONGESTION RELIEF PROJECTS AND THE ONE THAT'S IN THIS BILL THAT MEMORIALIZES THAT USE THE VERY BEST TO ADDRESS ALL THOSE EMERGENCY EVACUATION ISSUES. AND CERTAINLY RESOLVE THE ISSUES REGARDING THE ENVIRONMENT SO I URGE VIRGIN AYE VOTE JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE. AND I WILL TRY TO DO THE BEST JOB IN IF WE DON'T IT WON'T BE BACK HERE.

SENATE BILL ELEVEN NINETY NINE BY SENATOR MCGUIRE AN ACT RELATING TO STATE GOVERNMENT. SENATOR MCGUIRE. HAPPY FRIDAY MADAM PRESIDENT AND GOOD MORNING MEMBERS CALIFORNIA FACES A TERRIFYING NEW REALITY WHEN IT COMES TO THE SIZE AND SCOPE AND CANDIDLY pADDITION TO THE TENS OF BILLIONS OF INSURANCE CLAIMS OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT LIVES WERE LOST TWO FIRES. DURING TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SEASON ALONE ACROSS THIS GOLDEN STATE THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED THREE POINT SIX TO FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION HOMES IN THE WILD IN URBAN INTERFACE ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. BASE ON WILDFIRE RISK BASED ON WILD FIRE RISK MODELS INC FIRE DATA MORE THAN ONE MILLION HOMES IN THAT. ARE I THEIR VERY. FIRE RISK AREA IN AFFORD IN AVAIL IS WE- INCREASINGLY IN MORE CHALLENGING TO OBTAIN FOR AVERAGE MIDDLE CLASS CALIFORNIANS IN THOSE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE ON FIXED INCOMES APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY. THOUSAND OF OUR NEIGHBORS HAVE BEEN NON RENEWED FROM THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN. RESIDENTS AND COMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY FIRES BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN SITE 10% INCREASE IN NON RENEWALS RESULTING IN THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS LOSING THEIR HOME INSURANCE WHICH MEANS THEY CAN NO LONGER SELL THEIR HOME. IF THEY CAN'T SECURE RESIDENTIAL INSURANCE SB ELEVEN NINETY NINE WILL STAB WISH A NEW COMMISSION ON HARDENING. LED BY MEANS COMMISSION WHICH WE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING DATA DRIVEN IN SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND BEST PRACTICES FOR BOTH HOMEOWNERS IN COMMUNITIES TO REDUCE THE RISK. OF LOSS FROM WILDFIRES YOU KNOW THE COMMISSION ON HOME HARDING WILL ESTABLISH A TIERED SYSTEM A STANDARDS FOR FIRE PREVENTION OF INDIVIDUAL HOMES THE STATE TO INCLUDE VARYING LEVELS. OF HARDENING INCLUDING STANDARDS FOR FLYING NUMBER RESISTANCE IN FOR FLAMING HEAT RESISTANCE TO INCENTIVIZE HOMEOWNERS. TO TAKE THE STEPS THESE TERRORISTS IN THESE TEARS APPEALING TO RECOMMEND. IN IT IT IS FOR. ARCHERD CATION. I WILL SAY MATTER HER. THE GOOD CHAIR AS A SENATE TO HOUR TO SAY THING YOU TO THE CHAIRMAN HAVE BEEN WORK ON THIS ISSUE FOR A NUMBER OF MONEY. BUT SHE NIGHT OF TO TAKING AMENDMENTS THE SIM TO ADDRESS HER CONCERNS WHICH WILL REMOVE THE AUTOMATIC POLICY RENEWALS IN THE BILL. AND CLARIFY THAT INSURERS MAY CONSIDER THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION MAY CONSIDER THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION WHEN SETTING RATES AND IN. A SHOWING INSURANCE ADDITIONALLY AGREED UPON AMENDMENTS WILL ENSURE THE COMMISSION PUBLISHES ALL THEIR WORK IN RESEARCH USED TO SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATIONS AGAIN BUT NOT A PRESIDENT WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE- RICH CHAIR OF INSURANCE FOR HER PARTNERSHIP ON THIS BILL. LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE OUR WORK TOGETHER IN THE ASSEMBLY BUT PRESENT WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER MCGUIRE CENTER GROVE DID I SEE YOUR FLAG UP. OKAY PLEASE RECEIVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT DO YOU KNOW WHEN THE WHEN THE AUTHOR STARTED OFF THAT. WHEN HE WAS SAYING THAT YOU KNOW THIS- THIS STATE HAS. HAS SEEN A SCOPE OF OVER REACHING AND DEVASTATION RIGHT ANYWAY TO WILD FOR AS I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA SAY GOVERNMENT SO THAT THREW ME FOR A LITTLE BIT OF A LOOP. BUT I RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL AND THE REASON WHY. SO I MEAN YOU CAN CALL IT SELF CENTERED. SELFISHNESS OR WHATEVER BUT I LIVE IN A COMMUNITY WHERE WE LIVE- ABOUT EIGHT MILES FROM TOWN EIGHT MILES FROM TOWN OUT ON A CREEK AND THERE'S PROBABLY FORTY FIVE HOMES OUT THERE. EACH TIME HAS FIVE TO TEN TO TWENTY ACRES DEPENDING ON AND THEY'LL BACK UP AGAINST A CREEK. ALL OF THIS COULD NOT GET INSURANCE RENEWAL FOR HOME AND OUR PROPERTY THIS YEAR. BECAUSE OF THE POOR POLICIES PASSED OUT OF THIS BODY- AND NOT TO MENTION THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE NORTH OF US THE TWENTY MILE PEOPLE AWAY IN A THIRTY MILE PEOPLE AWARE OF THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN MOUNTAIN COMMUNITIES. LIKE TO HAVE TO PEE OR GLENDALE OR KERN VEIL. THEY LIVE IN THE LAKE AREA MY PHONE AT THE OFFICE IS RINGING OFF THE HOOK BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ANY INSURANCE AVAILABLE. I THINK THAT INSURANCE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO GET THE STATE IS AFFORDABLE THERE'S NO WAY IT'S AFFORDABLE AND THAT WAS A SUBSTITUTION POLICY THAT YOU GUYS PASSED OUT OF HIS BODY ALL TO OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE FOR INSURANCE. CAN TAKE THAT OUR PERSONAL INSURANCE WENT FROM THIRTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR WITH RANCH PROPERTY HORSES. BECAUSE ALL THAT IS A LIABILITY SHE- TO MAKE SURE YOU GO. WITH AROUND. EIGHT OR- UNDER ALL OR IS. TO SET. FIVE DOLLARS A- AND THERE IS LEADING TOWARD A S. WHO IS ELDERLY. WHOSE PROPERTY WE HELP HER TO MAKE. A SHE IS REALLY STRUGGLING TO PAY THAT INTO COSTS. WHAT'S REALLY SO ABOUT THIS IS THAT THIS IS NOT A SO. TO ANY OF THOSE PROBLEMS THAT RULE AMERICA IS FACING NOW I KNOW IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN YOU LIVE- RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO A FIRE STATION IN YOUR STACKED IN STAFF IMPACT AND HOUSING IN MOST OF THESE- CITY AREAS BUT THAT'S ALSO- BEEN PROVEN BECAUSE OF THIS CHO SITUATION THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT VERY SAFE WE LIVE. AT ALL SO I WOULD JUST ASK AUTHOR HE WOULD RECONSIDER AND JUST REALLY ADDRESS THIS- ISSUE IT IS NOT THE INSURERS PROBLEM INSURERS RIGHT POLICIES BASED ON RISK AND OF POLICIES ARE GOING TO BE PASSED THIS BUILDING. REQUIRE INSURERS TO A GREAT AMOUNT OF RISK WELL. INCREASE THE COST OF POLICIES AND SO POLICIES LIKE THIS THE INTEREST WILD- OR BY RATES LIKE THIS IN THIS INCREASE OR NOT THE INSURERS FAULT IT'S THE FAULT OF THIS BODY FOR PASSING LEGISLATION DOESN'T ALLOW. AN INJURES FOR A FAIR COMPETITIVE MARKET NAY URGING OVER. THANK YOU SENATOR GROCER MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT TO A COLLEAGUE SAID TO DO ARE TRUNCATED SESSION. THIS BILL WAS NOT REFERRED THE SENATE INSURANCE COMMITTEE WHERE I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE HAD SOME FUN- DEALING WITH IT- I'VE I FULLY UNDERSTAND APPRECIATE WHAT THE AUTHORS ATTEMPTING. TO DO AND I ADMIRE. HIS TENACITY AND HIS LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA. BUT ITS USE IN THE FREE MARKET. THAT DETERMINES BEST PRACTICES IN PRICES AND YOU KNOW IT'S INSURANCE ACCORDINGLY SO I. I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT MAYBE WERE INVERTING THE PROCESS. HOME HARDENING IS A RELATIVELY NEW SCIENCE WITHOUT ESTABLISH STANDARDS. BUT WE RE DONE A LOT OF THINGS- LIKE DISCOURAGING WOOD SHAKE ROOFS AND- PLANTING TRIBES NEAR HOMES- THERE'S BUT THERE HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF NEW AND REVOLUTIONARY. ACTIVITY I WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE COMING. FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN THE INSURANCE COMMUNITY AND I. LOOK FORWARD TO THE AMENDMENTS THAT WILL BE A PROVIDED- WINNING BACK FOR CONCURRENCE BUT AT THIS POINT I'M A LITTLE. WELL HAS TENTS ON. SB ELEVEN NINETY NINE THANK YOU MATTER PRESIDENT THANK YOU SAN MORE SENATOR. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT BOB AS CHAIR OF THE SENATE INSURANCE COMMITTEE I ALSO YOU KNOW I AGREE THAT THIS CLUB IN NINETEEN DID NOT GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR THIS. BILL IN THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE BODY I HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY WITH. SENATOR MCGUIRE AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK THEM FOR COMING TO THE TABLE WE'VE BEEN. REALLY ENGAGE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THIS BILL DOES THE RIGHT THING FOR CONSUMERS AND- I DON'T THINK. ANYONE'S MORE DEDICATED. THEN HE HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S DONE RIGHT AND SO I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THE AMENDMENT THAT HE HAS TAKEN. TO ALLOW US TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. CLEARLY WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN THIS AREA. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S DATA DRIVEN IN THAT WE HAVE THE INFORMATION WE HAVE. SO AGAIN I REALLY WANT TO THANK HIM OUR GOAL ULTIMATELY IS TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE HOUSE AFFORDABLE. AND AVAILABLE INSURANCE AND THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING DROP OR NON RENEWED AND SO I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS TO REMOVE. SECTION THREE PNC AND MAKING A MESS TO SECTION THREE EIGHT SO WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS THANK. THE CENTER RUBIO CENTER JONES. I JUST WANTED TO- RISE IN- BACK UP THE- CHAIR OF THE INSURANCE AND THE MEMBER- FROM ORANGE COUNTY OF INSURANCE WE DID HAVE A GOOD CONVERSATION ALL THAT DIDN'T GO THROUGH COM- INSURANCE AND WE DID HAVE A GOOD CONVERSATION IN GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION AND I KNOW THAT THE CHAIR OF INSURANCE HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR I LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS I'LL BE VOTING NO TODAY BUT- HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT WHEN IT COMES BACK ON CONCURRENCE. THANK YOU SENATOR JOHN SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU AND PRESIDENT I SUPPORT THIS BILL I DO JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY RESPOND TO CENTER FROM BAKERSFIELD TO- MADE A REFERENCE TO HOUSING DENSITY OR STOCK COMPACT HOUSING ISSUE FOR TO HAVING SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE PANDEMIC- THAT IS COMPLETELY FACTUALLY INACCURATE I'M HAPPY TO SEND HER THE BINDER OF STUDIES.

WE'VE LITERALLY LOST THOUSANDS THOUSANDS OF HOMES. IN DOZENS OF LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST. WHAT WE REALIZE IS THAT THE BUILDING CODE WHILE IT IS IMPROVE THE SAFETY THE SAFETY OF CALIFORNIANS WHICH BY THE WAY WERE PASSED BY THIS AUGUST BUT HERE YEARS AGO. WE KNOW WE NEED TO GO FURTHER. FOURTEEN OF THE TWENTY LARGEST WALLIN FIRES IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY FOURTEEN OF THE TWENTY HAVE HAPPENED IN THE LAST DECADE. TWELVE OF THE TWENTY MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES IN THIS STATE HISTORY HAVE HAPPENED IN THE LAST DECADE. THE LARGEST WHILE THEN FIRES THOUGH WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT HOW TIME IS SPEEDING UP BECAUSE OF THE ISSUE OF CLIMATE CHANGE HAS ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. WE CAN CONTINUE TO BE HOSTAGES AND STICK OUR HEAD IN THE SAND AND SAY THAT WE DO NOT NEED DATA DRIVEN POLICIES. IN SCIENCE THE BETTER DRIVER DECISION MAKING OR WE CAN SUPPORT THIS BILL. THIS BILL IS BY THE WAY MODELED AFTER WHAT FLORIDA DID WIN THE INSURERS PULLED OUT OF THE FLORIDA MARKET BECAUSE HURRICANES. IT DEVELOPS A HOME HARDENING COMMISSION. THAT DEVELOPS THE STANDARDS TO HELP KEEP CALIFORNIAN SAFE IF YOU WANT TO SAVE LIVES TODAY. YOUR SUPPORT THIS BILL. THIS ISN'T ABOUT POLITICS IT'S ABOUT SAVING LIVES AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE.

I TWENTY KNOWS EIGHT THE MEASURE PASSES MEMBERS ARE MOVING TO FILE ITEM THIRTY SIX SENATOR- BURKE MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL TWELVE TWENTY BY SENATOR UMBERG AN ACTUAL LEADING TO PEACE OFFICERS SENATOR UMBERG. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN WE SEE AN IMPERFECTION IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO IDENTIFIED IN AND CORRECTED AS WE KNOW OUR SYSTEM IS NOT PERFECT. BUT HERE'S A PROBLEM THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S HAVE REYES THAT NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED. FORTY YEARS AGO OR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS AGO IN A CASE CALLED BRADY VERSUS MARYLAND. THE US SUPREME COURT SAID THAT A DEFENDANT. HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW. INFORMATION AS TO A TESTIFYING OFFICER THAT MAY IMPEACH HIS OR HER TESTIMONY SO FOR EXAMPLE. IF AN OFFICER HAS SOMETHING IN THEIR PERSONNEL FILE THAT SAYS THEY FILED A FALSE REPORT. THEN DEFENSE COUNSEL AND DEFENDANT HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THAT. WELL THAT'S BEEN THE LAW SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE AND THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY OFFICERS BY NAME BADGE NUMBER. WHO HAVE SOMETHING IN THEIR FILE THAT MAY INDICATE THAT A DEFENSE COUNSEL OR DEFENDANT MAY WISH TO USE IT IN TERMS OF IMPEACHMENT ON CROSS EXAMINATION FOR OTHER PURPOSES THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO. A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY DOESN'T COMPILE THIS INFORMATION. AND DOESN'T ALERT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AS THE NAMES IN BATCH NUMBERS THEN THAT INFORMATION IS NOT COMMUNICATED TO THE DEFENSE AND THE RESULT IS THAT THE DEFENDANT MAY NOT KNOW IT. THE DEFENDANT MAY NOT KNOW IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO USE THAT INFORMATION. IN THEIR OWN DEFENSE. NOW DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT FAIRNESS OF COURSE AND JUSTICE OF COURSE. BUT THE OTHER ISSUE IS IT THAT INFORMATION COMES TO LIGHT LATER ON. THE DEFENDANT MAY HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE ANOTHER TRIAL BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL TRIAL. WASN'T FAIR THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT WAS REQUIRED. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT SAYS LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES YOU'VE GOT TO PRODUCE THIS INFORMATION. NOT THE INFORMATION BUT THE NAMES AND BADGE NUMBERS THIS ATTORNEYS THEN- IF REQUESTED PROVIDED TO THE DEFENSE AND THE DEFENSE CAN ASK A JUDGE TO LOOK OVER THAT PERSONNEL FILE TO SEE. WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S INFORMATION THAT MIGHT BE RELEVANT. TO THE DEFENSE IN THE ACTION THAT'S AT ISSUE SCOTT PITCHES MOTION. NOW ALSO IN THIS BILL IS A PROVISION THAT SAYS THAT IF AN OFFICER IS ON THIS LIST KNOWN AS THE BRADY LISTS THAT THAT OFFICER BEFORE HE GOES ON OR SHE GOES ON THE THEY'RE NOTIFIED AND THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY BY THE WAY THAT'S THE PROCESS THAT EXIST IN PLACES LIKE ALAMEDA COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY- LOS ANGELES VENTURA SAN MATTEO COUNTY THAT'S THE PROCESS THAT EXIST TODAY IT SIMPLY GIVES THE OFFICER AN OPPORTUNITY. TO TALK TO THE DISAPPEARING IT DOES NOT DELAY THE TRIAL AND IN FACT IT DOESN'T EVEN BECAUSE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY NOT TO DELIVER THAT INFORMATION TO DEFENSE COUNSEL THAT'S ALL IT DOES- SO MEMBERS ARE GINGIVAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR UMBERG MEMBERS MOVED TO DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WANTED TO- JUST- SPEAK BRIEFLY- ANDERSON ARMOR DID A GREAT JOB OF IDENTIFYING THE AMENDMENTS IN THE BILL. THAT ALLOW AN OFFICER TO I HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION AND- AND TALK TO IT SO I WILL I VOTED NO IN APPROPRIATIONS BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND THANK US IN OUR OWN BURKE FOR WORKING WITH THE STAKE HOLDERS AND- MAKING A GOOD BILL SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER JONES SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- WE HEARD THIS BILL IN PUBLIC SAFETY. AND THERE WERE SOME- IMPORTANT- ORGANIZATIONS THAT WERE NOT SUPPORTIVE. I WE TRIED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS I KNOW ADDITIONAL CONCERNS WILL BE ADDRESSED AS THE BILL MOVES TO THE ASSEMBLY. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. SB TWELVE TWENTY. IS A NARROW LEAD. CRAFTED EFFORT TO CODIFY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT COURT DECISION. THAT RULED THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CAN SHARE INFORMATION ONE OFFICER MISCONDUCT WITH DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S WHICH SOME AGENCIES ARE NOT DOING. N. B. WHAT THE BILL DOES IS AUTHORIZES LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO KEEP LIST OF OFFICERS WHO IN GAUGE SORRY. READING MY NOTES WHO ENGAGED IN MISCONDUCT IN REQUIRES THOSE AGENCIES TO TURN OVER THE LIST TO THE D. A.'S WHICH GIVES THE DA'S THE ABILITY TO KNOW WHEN TO TURN OVER INFORMATION TO DEFENSE ATTORNEYS ABOUT AN OFFICER'S CONDUCT THAT MAY SHED LIGHT ON THE CASE AND POTENTIALLY ON THE DEFENDANT'S INNOCENCE. AND FOR THOSE REASONS BY SUPPORTED THE BILL IN OUR COMMITTEE AND IT DID PASS COMMITTEE THOUGH I DO EXPECT IT TO BE FURTHER WORKED ON AS IT MOVES OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY. AND SO I RECOMMENDED I GO THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER MEMBERS SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. NUMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU- COLLEAGUES. I SHOULD ADD ONE OTHER ELEMENT TO THIS BILL ONE OTHER ELEMENT ISTHAT IN ADDITION TO SUSTAIN MISCONDUCT IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT. IF AN OFFICER HAS A SUSTAIN FINDING OF GROUP BIAS OF GROUP BIAS THAT THAT ALSO WOULD GO IN THE FILE AND THAT ALSO WOULD BE DELIVERED TO DEFENSE COUNSEL- FOR TO THIS IS THE IS THE MARK. PROVISION HE MIGHT NOT BE HAPPY ABOUT THAT BUT BUT IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT THE DEFENDANT KNOW IF AN OFFICER HAS A FINDING. IN THEIR FILE OF SOME SORT OF GROUP BIAS HIRED AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

TWELVE THIRTY SEVEN SEEKS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE FOR CHILD BIRTH BY ALLOWING CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES TO PRACTICE WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF A PHYSICIAN. SB TWELVE THIRTY SEVEN PROMOTES T. BASE CARE WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE SAFETY AND QUALITY OF CARE. SUPERVISION JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE ANYMORE IT'S NOT THE FIGHTING CALIFORNIA STATUTE IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE POSITION TO BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT EXAMINE THE PATIENT. SIGN A REVIEW ANY CHARTS OR OVERSEE PATIENT CARE IN ANY WAY. SUPERVISION FORCES NURSE MIDWIVES TO CONCENTRATE IN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WERE PHYSICIANS PHYSICALLY PRACTICE THEREBY REDUCING ACCESS PARTICULARLY IN RURAL COUNTIES IN LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES. THERE IS A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN RACE ACCESS MATURITY OUTCOMES IN MINORITY COMMUNITIES IMPROVING ACCESS TO NURSE MIDWIFERY CARE HAS BEEN NAMED BY LEADING ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE MARCH OF DIMES IN THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AS ONE OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES IN ADDRESSING RACIAL DISPARITIES IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. LASTLY I WISH TO POINT OUT THE CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF ONLY FOUR STATES IN THE NATION THAT STILL REQUIRE PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION IN ORDER FOR NURSE MIDWIVES TO PRACTICE. BUT MINUTES TAKING IN APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE SATISFY CONCERNS WERE RAISED BY THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION A AT ANY COST. THE LANGUAGE PLACES SAFEGUARDS THE BILL WHILE ALLOWING CERTIFIED. NURSE MIDWIVES TO FULLY A FULLY INDEPENDENT PRACTICE WITHIN THEIR LICENSE SCOPE THESE AMENDMENTS CODIFIED TEAM BASED CARE THAT RESULTS BOTH IN IN BOTH IMPROVED OUTCOMES IT ACCESS FOR WOMEN. CONSISTENT WITH WHAT FORTY SIX OTHER STATES HAVE ALREADY DONE SB TWELVE THIRTY SEVEN WILL REMOVE THE POSITION PERMISSION TO PRACTICE LAW FOR NURSE MIDWIVES IT ALSO THE POINTS WERE TRUE COLLABORATIVE CARE IS BETWEEN PHYSICIANS AND MIDWIVES. IT CREATES THE FOUNDATION FOR CONSULTATION COLLABORATION AND SEAMLESS TRANSFER OF CARE WHEN NEEDED. SPEC WE ASK YOUR ABILITY THANK YOU SENATOR DODD MOVING TO DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB TWELVE THIRTY SEVEN THAT CALIFORNIA'S MADE GREAT STRIDES TO REDUCE MATERNAL MORTALITY BUT WE STILL HAVE RATES OF MATERNAL AND INFANT MORTALITY FAR HIGHER THAN OTHER COUNTRIES WITH SIMILAR WEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT. BLACK WOMEN ARE THREE TO FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM PREGNANCY RELATED CAUSES AND CHILDBIRTH THAN WHITE WOMEN BLACK BABIES ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE BEFORE THEIR FIRST BIRTHDAY. NURSE MIDWIFERY CARE IS A IS A CRITICAL STRATEGY TO CURB THE DUAL CRISIS OF BOTH THE SEVERE WORK FORCE AND RACE BASED DISPARITIES MATERNAL OUTCOMES I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN US IN SUPPORTING SB TWELVE THIRTY SEVEN.

SENATE BILL THIRTEEN OH ONE BY SENATOR HUESO AND ACTUALLY INTO PUBLIC RESOURCES SENATOR HUESO. COMING THROUGH OKAY I AM NOW THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS AS AS MANY OF YOU KNOW SINCE YOU'VE BECOME FAMILIAR LATELY WITH THE QUAN OUT RIVER VALLEY IN THE SET AND SENEGAL COUNTY OF A BI NATIONAL RIVER VALLEY THAT HAS BEEN PLAGUED. BY POLLUTION AND- YOU KNOW- ON AN AVERAGE WE CAN ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION GALLONS OF SOMETIMES UNTREATED SEWAGE FLOW FROM MEXICO INTO THE THAT THE QUAN A RIVER VALLEY DUE TO. INACTION FROM AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN OUR GOVERNMENT OF AND THROUGH DO PROBLEMS IN MEXICO WITH THEM TREATING THEIR THEIR EFFLUENT AYE AYE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN I AUTHORED SB FIVE OH SEVEN WHICH AUTHORIZES ANNUAL COUNTY. TO CONDUCT THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT REPORT ON THE TIJUANA RIVER VALLEY THAT REPORT WAS RECENTLY RELEASED AND INCLUDES A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY IDENTIFIED TWENTY SEVEN PROJECTS THESE WILL GREATLY% REDUCE THE IMPACTS OF THAT THE WANDERER VALLEY. BASED ON STUDY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RECENTLY ALLOCATED THREE HUNDRED MOUNT BUILT INTO THE RIVER VALLEY BUT THE PROJECT IDENTIFIED. TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. IS A FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS DOLLAR DIVERTED THAT WILL CAPTURE A HUNDRED SIXTY THREE MILLION GALLONS OF RAW SEWAGE PER DAY. THIS WILL ESSENTIALLY STOP THE POLLUTION AFTER FORTY YEARS. BUT THIS. PROJECT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM EVERY SINGLE WATERSHED EVERY MAJOR RIVER IN CALIFORNIA HAS A WATERSHED MANAGEMENT PLAN- WE PASSED LEGISLATION. THREE YEARS AGO THAT WILL CREATE A REQUIREMENT THAT THE QUANDARY OF RIVER VALLEY CREATE A WATERSHED AS WELL BUT IT'S NOT A BI NATIONAL WATERSHED IN THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT A BI NATIONAL WATERSHED BE ESTABLISH AND QUIRK IN IN COLLABORATION WITH MEXICO ESPECIALLY SINCE SEVENTY PERCENT. OF THAT THE QUAN A RIVER VALLEYS WATERSHED IS IN MEXICO SO- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON WITH THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT THEY RECENTLY VOTED IN THEIR BI NATIONAL. IN THEIR BI NATIONAL AND THEN THEIR STATE LEGISLATURES. OFFICE OF BI NATIONAL AFFAIRS TO SET NOT ONLY SUPPORT MY BILL INITIAL LETTER IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. BUT TO WORK ON THE MEXICAN SIDE TO DEVELOP- A COMPLIMENT TEEN POLICY IN THIS WILL BE HER HUGE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN CENTERS WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON. A BI NATIONAL LEGISLATION HERE THAT WILL BE THE FIRST OF ITS KIND THAT WOULD OFFER STEWARDSHIP OF THIS IMPORTANT WATERSHED AND HOPEFULLY BE A PERMANENT SOLUTION. TO OF ALL THE PROBLEMS PEAK PLAGUE IN THIS RIVER SO I ASKTHAT YOU JOIN ME IN SUPPORT OF THIS EFFORT. AND HELP US SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IN THE YEARS TO COME I ASK FOR YOUR I VOTE FOR THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT'S ESSENTIAL TO THIS IMPORTANT RIVER VALLEY. THANK YOU CENTER HUESO CENTER MELINDA'S THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THIS. THIS ISSUE IS BIGGER THAN I THINK MANY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM REALIZE- I HAVE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH. THE POLLUTION THAT THE AUTHOR IS TALKING ABOUT OUR OUR OLDEST SON WHO'S IN THE NAVY. WAS THERE AND SEAL TRAINING IN SAN DIEGO I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES. THEY COULDN'T GET IN THE WATER. BECAUSE OF THE POLLUTION IN THE WATER IT IS A DANGER TO THEIR HEALTH. THESE ARE FOLKS WHO HAVE PARTICULAR TRAINING THEY MUST COMPLETE IN ORDER TO BE FULLY PREPARED TO DEFEND THIS COUNTRY THIS NATION OUR ALLIES WHEREVER THEY ARE SENT IN THE WORLD THEY CAN'T GET THE ADEQUATE TRAINING IF THEY CAN'T GET IN THE WATER AND DO THE THINGS THEY NEED TO DO. SO I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY A LITTLE MORE WORK. BIG YOU'RE GOING TO DOI MEAN THIS IS IN A IN A THIS IS THE DOESN'T FIX THE WHOLE PROBLEM BUT IT IS A START TO THE PROBLEM. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO KICK IT TO THE FEDS. WE NEED THEIR HELP NO QUESTION ABOUT IT AND I WISH THEY WOULD MOVE A LITTLE FASTER FRANKLY BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A NEW PROBLEM- BUT THIS STATE I THINK. HAS TO STEP IN WHERE OTHERS ARE NOT AND GET THE BALL ROLLING- SO WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTINGYOUR BILL TODAY. THANK YOU CENTER MELINDA'S SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER HUESO WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND DOES HAVE A HUGE. RESPONSIBILITY THROUGH THE ROLE IN THE I. B. W. C. WHICH IS. RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT OUR TREATIES WITH MEXICO ARE- ARE ENFORCED. AND WE'RE WORKING ON DOING THAT BUT IT WOULD BE- THE FIRST OF ITS KIND TO HAVE TWO STATES WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE A WATERSHED MANAGEMENT PLAN. THAT OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS WILL HELP IDENTIFY. THOSE IMPROVEMENTS OF THE NEED TO MAKE ME MAKE TO LET LESSEN THE RUN OFF. AND TO ELIMINATE THE POLLUTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

THE CLIMATE CRISIS WILL NOT WAIT DESPITE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING RIGHT NOW WITH CLOSELY THANK TEEN IN FACT HI THIS. THIS CALL COULD BE- A VERY DANGEROUS AND DEADLY WILDFIRE SEASON- THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT STARTING TO DO THE MATH AND LOOKING AHEAD IN THE NEAR TERM ABOUT THE COST FACING THE STATE CURRENTLY WE DO ASSESS CLIMATE CHANGE RESIDENTS STATE BUT IN A VERY SCIENTIFIC WAY TO SOFTEN THE FORCE FROM THE- VERY SERIOUS FISCAL REALITIES. THAT WILDFIRE HAS ON THE STATE BUDGET OR LOCAL AND- COUNTY BUDGETS- AND ON HUMAN HEALTH. ONE PARKS STORM PRINCE. ONE SUPER. MODEL BY U. S. P. S. ACOSTA ST. AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION THAT'S WHAT THE FIFTEEN BILLION WITH A B. IF WE GET A CONFLUENCE OF ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS AND STORMS AND WE DON'T HAVE PROPER FLOOD CONTROL BILL- SO WITH WILDFIRES. FLOODS IT'S A DEVASTATING ATTACK ISSUE OF. BILL OF NOT YET TO WRESTLE WITH AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR CLIMB RESILIENCE BOND AND WHETHER THAT'S TO BE EAGER- TOO MUCH RIGHT NOW. AND YOU LOOK AT A TRILLION DOLLAR LIABILITY FACING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS CENTURY FROM CLIMATE CHANGE- WE REALLY HAVE TO RIGHT SIZE ARE MATH AND UNDERSTAND THE SCALE THE RISK THEY WERE DEALING WITH INCREMENTALISM WILL NOT SOLVE THIS CHALLENGE AND- HOPEFULLY THIS BILL WILL.

SENATE BILL THIRTEEN FORTY ONE BY SENATOR TADO AND ACTUALLY TO CAL WORKS. CENTER HER TACO. CAN YOUHEAR ME OK THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TO PRESENT SB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE WHICH WILL ALLOW CALL WORKS FAMILIES WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN PLACED INTO FOSTER CARE TO CONTINUE RECEIVING MONTHLY CASH ASSISTANCE WHILE ACTIVE REUNIFICATION EFFORTS ARE ONGOING WITHIN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF REMOVING CASH ASSISTANCE FROM A FAMILY THAT IS ALREADY BELOW THE POVERTY LINE MAKES IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR FAMILIES TO REUNIFY WITH THEIR CHILDREN. ADDITIONALLY IT CAN DESTABILIZE THE FAMILY AND ALTERNATELY RESULT IN THE FAMILY BECOMING HOMELESS. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT HOUSING CRISIS. FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE FACING IT. IT IS TIME TO REVISIT THE POLICY DECISION THAT ALLOW SERVICES. BUT NOT CASH ASSISTANCE TO CONTINUE DURING REUNIFICATION EFFORTS DESTABILIZING FAMILIES TO THE POINT OF HOMELESSNESS IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO OTHER EFFORTS TO SUPPORT FAMILIES WHAT THE SEEK TO REUNIFY WITH THEIR CHILDREN. THIS BLL ONLY APPLIES TO FAMILIES THAT ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON REUNIFICATION WITH CHILD WHAT THE CHILDREN WILL FOR WORKERS MEANING THAT THE CHILD HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE PARENT AND PLACED IN OUT OF. OUT OF HOME CARE THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE CASES WHERE THE CHILD WAS REMOVED BUT THE COUNTY DOES NOT RECOMMEND FAMILY REUNIFICATION SERVICES. SB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE WILL ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF CHILD WELFARE PROGRAMS TO REUNIFY FOSTER CHILDREN. WHAT THEIR PARENTS. BY ALLOWING CAL WORKS FAMILIES WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE HAVE BEEN PLACED IN FOSTER CARE TO CONTINUE RECEIVING MONTHLY CASH ASSISTANCE WHAT ACTOR REUNIFICATION EFFORTS ARE ONGOING AND THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER HER TACO- DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR JACKSON. YES THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MIGHT.

NOT JUST OUR WILD LANDS DEEP INTO THE FOREST BUT REALLY THAT INTERFACE RIGHT AT THAT ZERO TO FIVE FEET NEAR THE HOME AND WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY- LANDSCAPE ZONE THAT THAT IS TRULY THE CAUSE OF MOST FIRES IN THE STATE THEY ARE THEY ARE TYPICALLY NOT STARTED FROM.

SENATE BILL NINE SEVENTY FOUR BY SENATOR TADO AN ACT RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY CENTER HER TACO THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I'M HERE TO RISE I RISE TO PRESENT SB NINE SEVEN FOUR AS MANY OF YOU KNOW MANY SMALL RURAL COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT AND BEYOND HAVE EXPERIENCED DRY WATER WELLS BRING CALIFORNIA'S HISTORIC DROUGHT AND IN NON DROUGHT YEARS. ANY TIME WHEN WASHING YOUR HANDS IS IMPORTANT TO MANY SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER BUT HE'S COMMUNITIES UNDERTAKEN WATER QUALITY PROJECTS SUCH AS FOLLOWING SEQUEL GUIDOLIN GUIDELINES OUR TIME AND COST PROHIBITIVE. LAST YEAR FOR EXAMPLE THE CITY OF OUR BAND CELEBRATED THE RIBBON CUTTING FOR CONSTRUCTION OF A WATER PROJECT A PROJECT IT TOOK FIFTEEN YEARS TO GET TO. FIFTEEN YEARS TO GET SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR THAT COMMUNITY THE CONSTRUCTION ITSELF. WAS ONLY TOOK OR IS TAKING SHOULD SHOULD NOT TAKE LONGER THAN A YEAR THAT'S TYPICALLY THE KIDS FOR CONSTRUCTION WATER PROJECTS SB NINE SEVEN FOUR CREATING NARAL STATUTORY SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR WATER PROJECTS IN THESE AREAS. ESPECIALLY FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN THIS BILL HELPS REDUCE COST AND EXPEDITE EXPEDITES SAFE DRINKING WATER PROJECTS THIS BILL STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN ACHIEVING EQUITABLE ACCESS TO WATER WHILE ALSO PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT WILDLIFE SPECIES AND PROVIDES GOOD PAYING JOBS. THIS BILL AS AMENDED THAT ADDED TO- LANGUAGE REGARDING LABOR REQUIREMENTS A PROJECT MUST MEET TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR BILLS A QUICK EXEMPTION FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS SB NINE SEVEN FOUR HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT RECEIVE NO NO VOTES IN COMMITTEE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER TARA DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR GORGEOUS. MEMBERS A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR ACTUAL SEPT SENATOR HER TITLE YOU ACCEPT A QUESTION YES PLEASE PROCEED. THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION HERE WHICH HAVE ALWAYS LIKE YEAH EXEMPTIONS- THING THEY'RE THEY'RE HELPFUL ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND WATER IS IT. ONLY FOR STATE ENTITIES PERSONS- STATE SPONSORED PROJECTS THAT A SEQUEL EXEMPTION IS ALLOWED. BUT WHAT IF IT WERE A PRIVATE CONTRACTED ENTITY WOULD THEY BE ALLOWED TO GET SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR THE WATER CONSTRUCTION. PROJECTS FOR THE SIX THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION IS ONLY FOR THE PUBLIC- THE PUBLIC PROJECTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER FOR JUST CENTER GROVE. SORRY HANG WITH US FOR SIX THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THERE YOU GO THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT A QUESTION THE AUTHOR. THERE HER TOTALLY TO THE QUESTION. YES PLEASE PROCEED ON- IT LOOKS LIKE JUNE EIGHTEENTH YOU CHECK AN AMENDMENT THAT INCLUDED A PREVAILING WAGE AND HIRING MOST UNION LABOR- FOR THIS BILL CAN YOU TELL ME WHY YOU DID THAT IF THE- IF THE- POSITION ON YOUR BILL AS IT IT'S A COST SAVING BILL AND WILL SAVE MONEY AND ALLOW- LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER. SENATOR TOM. YES SO THAT BOTH UNION AND NONUNION CONTRACTORS THAT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS CAN WORK WITH GRANT RECIPIENTS TO ACCOMPLISH THESE PROJECTS SO CALIFORNIA HAS- STATE PER PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND SOME ARE JOINTLY OFFERED BY UNIONS AND THEIR EMPLOYERS SOME- THAT ARE NON UNION OF COURSE- SO THESE PROVISIONS JUST SIMPLY STATE THAT THE GRADUATES OF THESE PROGRAMS WHICH MEANS THE WORKERS KILLED IN TRAIN SHALL. BUILD THESE PROJECTS. IT THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IT DOES AND I THINK YOU FOR THE ANSWER I CAN TELL YOU THAT ONE OF THE CITY'S IT IS REALLY STRUGGLING WITH CLEAN DRINKING WATER IN THE SENATOR GOOD SENATORS DISTRICT IS ARMING CALIFORNIA AND THEY HAVE A HUGE DEFICIT. AND FOR THIS MUNICIPALITY TO- COVER THE COST OF- TRIPLE OF THE COST OF WHAT WOULD LABOR WOULD COST IN A COMMUNITY OF OUR BEEN. ON WAGES THAT ARE SET IN SAN FRANCISCO. NOW THE DIFFERENCE IN ARVIN VERSUS SAN FRANCISCO IS AN ART AND YOU COULD PROBABLY GET A THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT% HOUSE FOR. RED SLEEP PROBABLY FIVE TO SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE THESE PREVAILING WAGES ARE SET. IT AT THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOUSE I HAVE TO RELY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO BUT I CAN PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE- AT SEVEN OR SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. SO I JUST THINK THAT SETTING PREVAILING WAGES FOR THESE SMALL RURAL COMMUNITIES WHERE THE COST OF LIVING IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS. THAN WHERE THE WAGES ARE SET IN SAN FRANCISCO DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR A MUNICIPALITIES. OUR CITIES AND THAT HAVE A STRUGGLING BUDGET A REDUCTION IN A WORK FORCE BECAUSE OF KOBE AND THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND TO SET. THE WAGES FOR THESE PROJECTS. IN SAN FRANCISCO AND REQUIRE THOSE WAGES BE PAID IN THE SMALL COMMUNITIES THEY DO NOT HAVE THE COST OF LIVING LIKE THESE MAJOR METROPOLISES. WHERE THE WAGES ARE SET IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE A COMPLETE WASTE OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS. IF A STANDARD WAGE A WAGE THAT WAS EQUITABLE THAT WAS SET BASED ON THE COMMUNITY IN THE REGION TO WHERE THE COST OF LIVING WAS WHICH WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD WAGE. THAN THOSE WATER PROJECT FUNDS COULD GO FURTHER AND MAYBE HELP ARVIN LAMONT WASCO SHE AFTER ALL THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE A LOWER- A LOWER. COST OF LIVING TO BE ABLE TO READ TO LIVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I REQUEST A NUMBER. THANK YOU CENTER GROW. SENATOR MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT. THE FIRST FOR US I JUST WANNA COMPLEMENT CENTER HER TITLE ON HER WORK ON THIS BILL. SO NUMBER ONE THERE IS NOT BEEN A BIGGER CHAMPION. A BIGGER CHAMPION FOR FAMILY SUSTAINING JOBS IN THE VALLEY THEN SENATOR HER TIME. EVERY STEP OF THE WAY SHE HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE HE'S PUTTING WORKING FAMILIES. BACK TO WORK IN THE VALLEY WHETHER IT'S ISSUES- PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS AND OR WITHIN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE. NUMBER ONE SHE HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT THE JOBS THAT ARE CREATED. CAN SUSTAIN A FAMILY. NUMBER TWO SHE'S BEEN FOCUSING ON LOCAL APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE GROWING UP IN THE VALLEY. CAN STAY IN THE VALLEY. AND THE NUMBER THREE WHERE SHE'S BEEN VERY FOCUS IS WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES IN MAKING SURE THAT THIS WORKS FOR THEM AS WELL. SO I JUST WANTED TO STAND UP TODAY- AND COMPLEMENT. THE GOOD SENATOR FROM THE VALLEY FOR ALL OF HER WORK ON THIS IN FOR HER KEEN FOCUS HER KEEN FOCUS ON CREATING THOSE JOBS THAT ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO. RISE FOLKS AT A PARTY.

SENATE BILL ELEVEN ELEVEN BY SENATOR DORADO AN ACT RELATING TO JUVENILES SENATOR DORADO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS SENATE BILL ELEVEN ELEVEN AMENDS CALIFORNIA LAW TO PERMIT YOU TO STAY IN JUVENILE FACILITIES PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE JUVENILE COURT CASE UNTIL THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE. SB ELEVEN ELEVEN CRATES OF BOTTLED PROCESS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER YOU'VE AGE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE WHOSE CASES ORIGINATED IN JUVENILE COURT SHOULD BE HOUSED IN THE DOLE JAILS. THIS BILL CREATES A PRESUMPTION FOR KEEPING YOU IN JUVENILE FACILITIES AND REQUIRES A THE JUDGE DECIDE WHETHER OR YOUTH MAYBE MOVED. IT PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR THE JUDGE'S DECISION CURRENTLY THERE ARE O THE LAW PROVIDES NO STANDARDS FOR THIS DECISION. IT ALLOWS THE USER TO BE MOVED TO THE DOLE JAIL IF THE JUVENILE FACILITY CANNOT SAFELY CARE FOR THEM. OR IF THE PHYSICAL SPACE CANNOT ACCOMMODATE AN OLDER POPULATION IT SIMPLIFIES AND CONSOLIDATES THE RULES WERE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF YOUTH INCLUDING YOUTH IN JUVENILE COURT AND YOU DO HAVE BEEN ORDERED TRANSFERRED TO THE ADULT COURT. ONCE THEY ARE HELD IN THE ADULT JAIL YOU NO LONGER RECEIVE EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE SERVICES FOR THE AGE APPROPRIATE PROGRAMMING AVAILABLE IN JUVENILE FACILITIES. THEY FACE AN INCREASE RISK OF PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL ABUSE THEY SUFFER WITH A HEIGHTENED RISK OF SUICIDE AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. OFTEN THE SAME YOU ARE TRANSFERRED BACK TO THE JUVENILE FACILITY AFTER THE DISPOSITION OF THE CSE AFTER SUFFERING DISRUPTIONS IN THEIR EDUCATION IN PROGRAMMING. SB ELEVEN ELEVEN HAS NO OPPOSITION AND IT IS IMPORTANT DURING THIS PANDEMIC BECAUSE IT WOULD REDUCE THE TRANSMISSION OF- ILLNESSES AND EASE CONDITIONS FOR STAFF TASKED WITH MONITORING YOUNGER INMATES IN ADULT FACILITIES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR EYE BELOW. THANK YOU STANDARD ROCCO DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATE NIELSEN. THAT A PRESIDENT AND- AT THE SAN THIS A BROADER CONTEXT THE SO CALLED REFORMS OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. I THINK A VERY PROBLEMATIC. WHAT'S GRAVITATED OUT OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM NOW HAS BECOME AGAIN LIKE MANY THINGS RELATED TO REALIGNMENT FOISTED UPON THE COUNTIES. THE MISSION OF THE JUVENILE SYSTEM IS ALL REHABILITATION. AND ARE COUNTY SHOULD DO NOT HAVE THE REHABILITATIVE RESOURCES. WHEN THIS REALIGNMENT CAME DOWN THAT WAS REPORTED TO BE ALL KINDS OF MONEY WOULD BE FORTHCOMING TO THEM WELL IT HASN'T BEEN AND THEY'RE WRESTLING WITH. AND NOW THE JUVENILE POPULATION THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS BILL. THESE THESE ARE TO. THE BEST OF OUR YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS THEY ARE OF THE WORST OF OUR YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS. IT IS MY EXPERIENCE THAT THE SOME OF THEM. ARE NOT GOING TO GET ANY BETTER NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. IN THIS REMOVES SOME AUTHORITY I THINK FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MANAGE THAT POPULATION AS THE BEST SEE FIT. I WOULD URGE AND OVER. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN MEMBERS SEEING NO FURTHER. ONE MOMENT. SENATOR JACKSON'S SENATOR RUBIO. IT'S THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I YEAH I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM TO HIM IS OBSERVATION THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES WHAT WE DON'T HAVE IS THE WILL. AND I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL WE REALLY NEED TO TURN THIS WHOLE PROCESS AROUND. SO THAT WE CAN. TRY TO REHABILITATE AND TO SUPPORT OUR YOUTH I AS THEY EXPERIENCE THE UPS AND DOWNS IN THE VAGARIES OF THEIR LIVES. ARE CHALLENGES AND SO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS AND- JOSH AS WE GO FORWARD IN DEALING WITH ISSUES REGARDING OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION IN REHABILITATION BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT SIMPLE INCARCERATION AND PUNISHMENT HAS COST THE STATE FAR TOO MUCH MONEY WITH VIRTUALLY NO POSITIVE RESULTS SO OUR YEP APPRECIATE HIS GOOD WORK IN HIS PASSION ON THIS ISSUE. BUT I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE TURN THAT CORNER AND SEE THAT THERE ARE OTHER AND BETTER WAYS TO RESOLVE THESE PROBLEMS. WE NEED THE WILL. TO USE THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE TO EFFECTUATE THOSE THOSE NECESSARY CHANGES I URGE AN EYEFUL THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENTE I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ELEVEN ELEVEN I YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT I BELIEVE I'VE BEEN TRULY OUTSPOKEN IN THIS CHAMBER ABOUT VICTIMS RIGHTS AND- AND EMAIL- BE PROTECTIVE OF THOSE VICTIMS BUT IN THIS CASE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR CHILDREN AND I THINK THAT. THERE COMES A TIME THAT WE HAVE TO STEP OF FOR OUR YOUTH I FEEL THAT. SOMETIMES AND GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY BILL DO RIGHT BY US AND THE REALITY IS THAT TIME WHEN THEY'RE CAUGHT UP IN THIS WEB IT MAKES IT'S STILL VERY DIFFICULT. FOR THEM TO COME OUT OF IT AND I ALWAYS THINK OF THEM AS ADULTS AND WE DON'T GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY NOW EIGHT. IT JUST REALLY NOT. UP AND GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY. TO RECTIFY THEIR BEHAVIOR AND DA'S SOMEONE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT. PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG IS CRITICAL. AND SO I URGE AND I BOTH THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO SENATOR GROW. MADAM PRESIDENT I WASN'T GOING TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL TO THE COMMENTS CAME UP I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM TO HIM AND IT SAYS THAT- WE DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDING AND SPENDING- IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND THESE YOUTH THAT ARE INCARCERATED IN THESE JUVENILE FACILITIES. I ALSO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA WHO SAYS THAT WE HE IT'S NOT ABOUT THE FUNDING IT'S ABOUT THE WILL TO- TO PRODUCE THE SPENDING AND SOME OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE JUST PASSED THIS WEEK BASED ON JUST THE MAJORITY PARTY'S VOTE. THE WILL TO DE FUND THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AT TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS WOULD HAVE DONE A LOT OF GOOD FOR THESE YOUTH IN THESE FACILITIES IN ORDER TO HAVE THE FUNDING NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT REHABILITATION SERVICES WERE AVAILABLE TO THESE USE- A LOT OF YOU KNOW MY BACKGROUND. A LOT OF YOU KNOW I WAS RAISED BY SINGLE MOM MY DAD LEFT WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG AND IN A LOT OF YOU KNOW THAT I SERVE TIME IN JUVENILE HALL- BEFORE IN MY EARLY HIGH SCHOOL DAYS. AND SO. THERE ARE. READ AND REHABILITATIVE SERVICES AVAILABLE OBVIOUSLY AS I AM STANDING ON THE SENATE FLOOR TODAY AND REPRESENTING OVER A MILLION PEOPLE- WITHOUT A COLLEGE DEGREE. AND WITHOUT A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT- PEOPLE ARE MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO DATE- AND AGAIN MY BACKGROUND IS FROM A SINGLE MOM. AND SHE WORKED IN THE FIELDS WERE TO THE POTATO SHEDS- SO I INTO WORK IN A FARMER'S INSURANCE AGENT BECAUSE SHE WENT BACK TO SCHOOL AT THIRTY YEARS OLD AND GOT HER HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA- SO. I GET MY TENACITY IN MY FOURTH RIGHT IN MY FIGHT FOR MY MOTHER- IN BUT LIKE I SAID THIS IS A CONTROVERSIAL BILL NOT CONTROVERSIAL IN THE WAY THAT. IT DEALS WITH THAT IT'S A BAD BILL IT JUST DEALS WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER. THAT DESPERATELY DOES NEED FUNDING FOR REAL BILL TATIAN SERVICES. AND THERE IS A WAY TO DO IT YES LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA SAID- WE HAVE THE WILL TO DO IT- WE NEED TO REDUCE TAXES WE DON'T NEED TO DO THE THINGS THAT ARE PUT FORTH ON THIS. BY THE MAJORITY PARTY IN THIS BODY. WE JUST DIDN'T NEED TO ADDRESS HORRIFIC SPENDING BY THIS STATE THAT DOES NOT PRIORITISE. SITUATIONS LIKE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE- YOU KNOW UNDER TWENTY ONE SOMETHESE KIDS ARE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN WHEN THEY COMMIT A CRIME. MOST OF YOU KNOW I OWN A BUSINESS THAT WE GET PEOPLE JOBS AND WE WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH AUTHORITY AND THEY BRING THESE KIDS IN HERE. AND SOME OF THEM YOU KNOW. I'M SKINNY ON A SOMEWHAT THEM IT'S LIKE THERE'S NO HOPE YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET THEM TO DO- WHAT'S RIGHT IN SOCIETY. BUT THERE ARE SOME WHO GENUINELY COME OUT OF THERE THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE SYSTEMS AND THEY WERE FOURTEEN YEARS OLD. AND THEY COME OUT AND THEY HAVE BEEN IN A FOOD LINE. FOR THE LAST. FIVE YEARS SIX YEARS GETTING THEIR FOOD FROM A TRAIN- AND GOING AT A CAFETERIA STYLE. AND SO I HAD THIS YOUNG MAN CAME INTO MY OFFICE AND HE GOES I GOT THIS JOB AND HE'S GOT A BAG OF BREAD. IN SOME BOLOGNA AND HE'S LIKE CAN I CAN I MAKE A SANDWICH AMENITIES AND NOT GET POISONED BECAUSE HE WAS THINKING THAT IF HE DIDN'T HAVE A SANDWICH REFRIGERATED. SO WHICH IS THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THEY GROW UP IN. SO I THINK THAT IF WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO- DO REAL BILLETED HATE OF SERVICES. AND REACH THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AT A PLACE FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN BE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED AND BE A PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF SOCIETY. WE SHOULD DO THAT. AND DEAL WITH THE OTHER ONES IN A DIFFERENT WAY BUT- I PLUG THE AUTHOR FOR BRING IT FORWARD LIKE I SAID I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM TO HE MEANT. THAT RESOURCES NEED TO BE AVAILABLE AND ALSO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA. THAT IF THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY AND THERE DEFINITELY IS A WILL ON OUR SIDE TO LIMITED HIGH SPEED RAIL FUNDS TO HELP WITH HIS JUVENILE. ISSUE THAT WE HAVE. BIG SENATOR GROW SENATOR MITCHELL. BUDGET TRAINING ONE OH ONE DOLLARS ALLOCATED TO TRANSPORTATION. COULD NOT IF WE WANTED TO BE REDIRECTED TO JUVENILE DETENTION. I GET. I THINK IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE THAT THAT WE AS LEGISLATORS AND EVEN ADULTS ARE FIND OURSELVES SPEAKING IN GROSS GENERALITIES ABOUT KIDS IN AND- BASED ON OUR INDIVIDUALIZE EXPERIENCE THE EVEN SIR EITHER EITHER SERVING ON THE BOARD AND PRISON TERMS DECADES AGO OR EXPERIENCES WE HAVE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE. WHATEVER THAT WE HAVE THESE GENERAL. IS A WORTHY AND WHO'S NOT. THIS BILL SAYS. TO BRING US BACK TO THE DEBATE AT HAND. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE ANY PERSON WHO'S CASE ORIGINATED IN JUVENILE COURT TO REMAIN IN A COUNTY JUVENILE FACILITY UNTIL THEY TURN TWENTY YEARS OF AGE EXCEPT EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED. AND SO WHETHER OR NOT WE THINK THEY'RE REDEEMABLE OR NOT. THEY HAVE A CASE IN JUVENILE COURT AND THIS BILL SIMPLY SUGGEST THAT THEY SHOULD STAY IN A JUVENILE FACILITY AT THE COUNTY LEVEL PERSON BE TRANSFERRED TO A STATE ADULT FACILITY FOR THOSE REASONS I'LL BE SUPPORTING SB ELEVEN ELEVEN. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL CENTER MELINDA'S. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- YESTERDAY WE DEBATED A BILL THAT SAID THAT- SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS ARE SO WISE. SO SAGE BEYOND THEIR YEARS STATE THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT. WHO REPRESENTS THEM IN OFFICE. THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOTED SEVENTEEN YET TODAY WE'RE HAVING CONVERSATION SAYING THAT NO NO THEY'RE NOT. WISE ENOUGH THEY'RE NOT MATURE ENOUGH. TO BE HELD IN A PARTICULAR TYPE OF FACILITY. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT PUTTING IN AN TWENTY OR TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD IN WITH. KEEPING THEM WITH FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS. THAT IS THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME VERY DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES YOU KNOW THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE THOSE IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN YOU KNOW THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD AND A TWENTY YEAR OLD AND I DON'T. THINK THAT. REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE CASE STARTED I DON'T THINK IT'S WISE. TO SUGGEST THAT IT'S PERFECTLY SAFE. TO PUT INDIVIDUALS A BAD AGE- TOGETHER WHEN YOU'RE EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD BY THE LAW YOU'RE RECOGNIZED AS AN ADULT NOT A CHILD. AND THOUGH IT IS UNFORTUNATE FOR SURE THAT WE HAVE. PEOPLE EVEN IN THIS SITUATION I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SAFETY IN THE PROTECTION OF YOUTH GET TO TALK ABOUT IN THE FULL CONTEXT AND THAT IS THAT A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD I THINK COULD BE PLACED IN YOUR DANGER WHEN IN THE SAME FACILITY WITH ONE THAT IS. TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD AND MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED THAT- YOU KNOW THIS WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS WHO HAVE. DONE SOME MONEY- CRIME. OFTENTIMES ARE TALKING MISS HIM VERY VERY- SERIOUS AND VIOLENT CRIME SO I JUST WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT IT'S NOT THAT THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. HAVE NO MERCY TOWARD OUR YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO BE SMART ABOUT. HOW THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE PUTTING THEM AND TO KEEP THEM ALL SAFE. DECEMBER MELINDA'S CENTER PAN. I THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. AND CHAIR OF SENATORS. I DID WANT TO SERVE ADDRESS US SOME REMARKS ABOUT- I THINK THE DEVELOPMENT AS OF OUR ADOLESCENTS AND- CERTAINLY IS A- PHYSICIAN WHO'S ACTUALLY SPECIFICALLY TRAINED AND DEVELOPMENT- YEAH I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD AND A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD AND I'M SURE THE FACILITY. HAVING EXPERIENCE MANAGING USE- WILL HAVE. SEIZURES AND POLICIES TO ADDRESS THAT I THINK THAT WE ALSO SHOULD THINK THOUGH AND WHAT THEY THINK THIS BILL ADDRESSES IS THAT YOU IF YOU HAD SOMEONE WHO YES THERE ARE NOW IN THEIR EARLY TWENTIES WHO IS BASICALLY STILL HAVE SOME TIME LEFT TO IS BEEN IN A JUVENILE FACILITY. THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BOTH EITHER FOR THAT A JUNE THAT PERSON I AM A COMMON JUVENILE MORE OF THEIR IN THEIR TWENTIES BUT TO THEN BE TRANSFERRED TO AN ADULT PRISON WHERE THERE'S A VERY DIFFERENT CULTURE OR THEIR NOW EMBEDDED WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE. HE BASICALLY PERHAPS HAVE A LITTLE MORE EXPERIENCE- IT CETERA SO I MEAN. IF YOU KNOW WHAT. CERTAINLY I THINK ONE OF THE GOALS WE HAVE HIS REHABILITATION RIGHT AND- I THINK THAT A JUVENILE FACILITY CERTAINLY CAN THROUGH THEIR PROCEDURES I THINK HE'D BE ABLE TO MANAGE SOMEONE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YEAR OLD AND A TWENTY OR EVEN TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD. TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD PERSON- BUT I'M NOT SURE IF. WE'RE GOING TO IT'S GONNA BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO TAKES SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN AND DIED IN GIVEN NOW WHO. AND THEN THEM TO ADULT PRISON. TO COMPLETE- TERM AND THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE HELPFUL EITHER TO THE PRISON TO SOCIETY AS WELL IN TERMS OF THE REHABILITATION I WOULD OR DENY THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN CENTERVILLE. I'M ALWAYS SO INTERESTED IN THESE DISCUSSION ON BILLS BECAUSE I KIND OF TAKE THE PERSPECTIVE HAVE BEEN ON. CRIMINAL YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC SAFETY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I WAS WITH CENTER HANCOCK CENTERS SKINNER. AND WE'VE LOOKED AT THE NUMBERS AND I TEND TO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS THE RESEARCH AND THE RESEARCH SHOWS ONE THING IT'S WAY MORE EXPENSIVE. FAR MORE EXPENSIVE. TO PUT A YOUNG PERSON EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE. INTO A ADULT FACILITY BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE A LONGER TERM. EVENTUALLY OVER THE LIFE OF THAT PERSON STAY IN IN PRISON NOT THEY THEY WILL GO BACK TO PRISON BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST LIKE PUTTING A MAN CRIME COLLEGE. IF YOU PUT A YOUNG PERSON IN AN ADULT FACILITY. IT'S EXTREMELY HERE IN HUMANE TO PUT SOMEBODY THAT'S A YOUNG PERSON. IN AN ADULT FACILITY. I THINK THAT WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT NUMBERS WHAT'S THE COST OKAY. THE STATE JUVENILE CORRECTIONS FACILITIES THEY RUN ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PER INMATE PER YEAR. WE FORTUNATELY HAVE A NEW REFORM THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING. OVER THE NEXT YEAR FINALLY. TO FOCUS. A LIMITING DOUBT AND CREATING A NEW AGENCY UNDER THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT- JUVENILE FACILITIES IN THE STATE YOU KNOW WHAT THE YOU KNOW WHAT THE OCCUPANCY IS LESS THAN A THIRD ARE OCCUPIED. I REPEATTHAT THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE LESSEN THE THIRD ARE OCCUPIED. TO ME IT TO ME. THE GOAL IS TO PUBLIC SAFETY GOAL IS TO NOT HAVE A PERSON RESERVE A AND THE LEAGUE AND- TO CORRECT A MISTAKE THEY MADE WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG PERSON. AND LEAD A BETTER LIFE. AND SO I THINK THIS THIS BILL. WILL BE A PERFORMANCE BILL IT'LL PERFORM BETTER THAN WHAT WE DO NOW. SO I VOTE I THINK THIS WILL SAVE MONEY. IT'S A HUMAN. IT HELPS THE HUMAN BEING. BUT IT ALSO SAVES A STATE A LOT OF MONEY YOU WANT TO KEEP SPENDING MONEY. VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL. YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU'LL SEE. THAT WE WILL END UP SPENDING TONS OF MONEY. IT MAY BE IT MAY BE. HELP TERMS OF LIVES TO IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT STOPPING CRIME. STOPPING CRIME. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO STOP CRIME. SERGEANT VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR BILL MEMBERS SEE NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR ALSO YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THEY'RE ALREADY NINETEEN COUNTIES THAT ALLOWED TRANSITION AGE YOU TO BE HELD IN THE JUVENILE FACILITIES BOTH COUNTIES HAVE NOT REPORTED ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS. JUVENILE FACILITIES ARE OPERATING UNDER CAPACITY SO THAT IS NOT THE ISSUE TODAY THE ISSUE IS ABOUT STANDARDIZING THIS ACROSS TE STATE AND I LASTLY WANT TO SAY THAT. I WILL NOT GIVE UP ON ANYONE ESPECIALLY OUR YOUTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALLEN I ARCHULETA OR AYE ATKINS I FACE.

SENATE BILL OPEN THIRTY BY SENATOR GONZALEZ AND ACTUALLY TO TELL TELECOMMUNICATIONS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT DONALD MEMBERS- I AM HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SB ELEVEN THIRTY WHICH IS A CRITICAL MEASURE TO HELP CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BOTH DURING AND AFTER THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC A LACK OF ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET WAS AN ISSUE IN OUR COMMUNITIES EVEN BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC TO COLD AND CRY STATE LEADERS EXAMPLES OF HOW THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. IS TWENTY CALIPHATE TERMING IN CREDIT ACTED. I HAVE FIVE KIDS AND A ROOM WITH AND WE OLDER CALIFORNIANS. CAN NOT HAVE ACCESS OR DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO RECEIVE TELEHEALTH SERVICES. AND OTHER COUNTRIES A HUB FOR TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION THIS IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE AND WE MUST DO BETTER. A LACK OF LONG TERM INVESTMENT IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY READY BROADBAND TECHNOLOGIES IT IS A KEY DRIVER OF THE EXISTING DIGITAL DIVIDE. AND AT ELEVEN THIRTY WILL BEGIN TO THE INVESTMENT NEEDED TO BUILD FUTURE PROOF CONNECTIVITY TO EVERY HOME SCHOOL BUSINESS EVERY PART OF. FORMULA THE BIG. THIS BILL WILL REDEFINE THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND. TO ENABLE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT REPLACE OUTDATED INTERNET SPEEDS AND UNSERVED AREAS. THIS CHANGING CRITERIA WILL ENABLE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS OF ALL SIZES TO APPLY FOR GRANTS AND AT THE SAME TIME. INVEST IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY- INFRASTRUCTURE CURRENTLY. THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ADVANCED SERVICES FUND ARE TIED DIRECTLY TO LOW INTERNET SPEEDS MAKING MOST INTERESTED AND- WOULD LIKE TO DEPLOY A FASTER SPEEDS IN ELIGIBLE FOR THE GRANT FUNDS. TO NOTE CURRENTLY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SITTING IN THE FUND THAT NEED TO BE LEVERAGED. CERTAINLY ARE THE P. YOU SEE I'M SORRY SB ELEVEN THIRTY WILL ALLOW THE PC TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO FINANCE OPEN ACCESS HIGH SPEED BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. THAT WOULD BRING CALIFORNIA ON PAR WITH INTERNATIONAL NORMS. AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT I ACCEPTED ENERGY- COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR WORKING WITH THE ISSUE OF RULE SERVER AREAS AND ENSURING THAT THESE. ARE THIS FUND. SB THIRTY PASSED OUT OF THE SENATE ENERGY UTILITIES AND COMMIT COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. AND HAS ALSO HAD THE SUPPORT OF A RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES LIKE RC RC AND IS MEASURE IS ALSO A LEGISLATURE LATINO CAUCUS PARTY BUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER GONZALEZ MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE SENATOR DOLLY. THE MATTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T TO. THE REALLY RESPECT THE CLASS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- GOING TOE TO TOE HERE BUT- IN IN I THINK WAS TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN WE GET THE BILL SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE. IN THE SIMPLY THAT ACTUALLY. MADE THESE FUNDS AVAILABLE AND DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS THE LOCATION OF THAT- PIECE OF LEGISLATION WE WERE TARGETING AREAS THAT WERE NOT JUST UNDERSERVED BUT NOT SERVED AT ALL. AND SO THOSE FUNDS THERE'S FIFTY I THINK FORTY FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY APPLICATIONS AT THE P. YOU SEE RIGHT NOW. ACCORDING TO THOSE POSH THOSE FUNDS WILL BE EXPANDED. TO DO EXACTLY WHAT WE INTENDED TO DO THESE ARE CAST OF FUNDS- EVERYBODY GETS A LITTLE CHARGE ON THEIR ON THEIR BILL AND THERE FOR UNDERSERVED AREAS. THE BILL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY WELL ACTUALLY IS A WAY HIGHER SPEED IN THOSE AREAS THAT- WE WERE FOCUSED ON SIXTY SIXTY FIVE. I ONLY SAID I KNOW THAT TO THE GROUP THAT PUT THAT BILL TOGETHER SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE- IS CONVENING AGAIN THEY REACH OUT TO ME I WILL BE WORKING ON. ANOTHER PIECE OF LEGISLATION WE ABSOLUTELY DO NEED TO SERVE UNDERSERVED AREAS BUT THERE IS A DON'T HAVE ANY SERVICE AT ALL SHOULD BE THE TARGET FIRST NOT GETTING HIGHER SPEEDS FOR AREAS THAT ALREADY HAVE. SERVICE AND YOU KNOW THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT. INNER CITIES AND THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO- GET THOSE LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED FOLKS IN THE INNER CITIES- SERVICE BUT I WILL SHARE THIS WITH YOU IF YOU GO. TO MANY PARTS OF THE RULE PART OF CALIFORNIA. YOU CAN'T GET SERVICE I CAN GO TO ANY STARBUCKS OR ANY PLACE IN THE INNER CITY AND GET ON THE WIFI AND GET MORE SERVICE THAN YOU GET THE RULE AREAS SO MY GOOD COLLEAGUE IT'S RUNNING THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION WE NEED TO EXPAND THE POT SO WE CAN SERVE- ALL THOSE AREAS WE SHOULD FIRST SERVE THE AREAS THAT HAVE NO SERVICE ARE VERY VERY LOW SERVICE- FOR EXAMPLE WHERE I LIVE MY KIDS HAD TO DRIVE SIX MILES TO TAKE AN AP CLASS BECAUSE WE JUST DID NOT HAVE SERVED OUR OWN. THERE SHOULD VOTE FIRST I KNOW THIS BILL IS GOING TO GET OUT TODAY. AND I JUST WOULD ENCOURAGEYOU WHEN IT COMES AROUND NEXT TIME TO BE ENGAGED. TO EXPAND THOSE FUNDS AND EXTEND THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA BE OUT IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR FOR THOSE RESULT BE OPPOSING THE BILL. I DON'T WANT TO. TAKE AWAY FROM THE POT OF MONEY THAT'S ALREADY EXISTING THANK YOU MEMBERS. THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN SENATOR GORGEOUS. I'D LIKE JUST TO CONFIRM- SOME CONCERNS THAT MY CALLING JUST MENTION I THINK BOB THIS PIECE LEGISLATION HAS SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT BUT MAYBE IN HE AUTHORS CLOSING SHE COULD TALK ABOUT MORE DETAIL. ON I BELIEVE THE FREE THAT WAS USES THAT THERE BE PRIORITY FOR RURAL AREAS IN YOUR CLOSING IF YOU CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT GUARANTEES THERE ARE IT IS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD. ALLOW FOR RURAL AREAS TO BE PRIORITIZED OVER- URBAN UNSERVED AREAS THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER BORCHERS THING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER CONSOLES PLEASE CLOSE. YES I JUST WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FROM A BEEPER AND FROM- THE FRESNO AREA FOR BRINGING UP THESE CONCERNS AND WE CERTAINLY WHEN WE BROUGHT- FOR THIS- ITEM WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT RURAL AND URBAN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WE WERE PRIOR THERE'S A COMMON MISCONCEPTION THAT UP PARTS OF LA COUNTY FOR INSTANCE WHAT I REPRESENT ARE COMPLETELY STRIPPED AND IT'S NOT TRUE. THERE ARE AN INCORPORATED PARTS OF LA COUNTY THAT ARE COMPLETELY OFF THE GRID WITH NO INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THERE ARE BROAD SUCH THAT. HE SO WE'RE UNABLE FIELD I THINK- WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS AND IT SHOULD THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT THOSE AREAS UNSERVED WHAT ARE YOU ARE AND URBAN LOS ANGELES OR RURAL FRESNO AREA THAT YOU BE PRIORITIZE. A ANOTHER IS THAT WE SETTLE POST JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE. BUT IS TWENTY FIVE THREE TWENTY FIVE I UP DOWNLOAD THREE UPLOAD THAT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH FOR KIDS AND RIGHT NOW A LOT OF OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES HAVE SIX ONE WHICH MAKES YOU ELIGIBLE FOR THE FUNDS CURRENTLY AS IT STANDS. THIS BUNDLE OF THIS BILL WILL NOW A STATE THAT YOU WILL HAVE AN ABILITY TO RE ENGAGE WITH THE- AND ACTUALLY HAVE A SPEED THAT WILL WORK FOR YOU ESPECIALLY GIVEN THIS TIME. SEE WHAT IT OPEN AT AND PROMOTES COMPACT COMPETITIVE ALLOWS FOR LOWER RATES IN SOME CASES AND IT ALLOWS FOR A DEEP MONOPOLIES A OF OUR- EXACT BUT WE- I. LIKELY AFTER I'VE BUT I THINK YOU FOR ENGAGING APPRECIATE IT AND I LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH EVERYONE. THANK YOU CENTER GONZALEZ MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

OVER THE YEARS OF BEEN ABLE TO BE IN THE PRESENCE IS A VERY WONDERFUL INDIVIDUALS VERY ELOQUENT SPEAKERS AND PROBLEM SOLVERS ACHIEVERS. EVERY TIME AFTER I CAME BACK HERE AFTER EIGHTEEN YEARS ABSENT. THEY WOULD ASK ME JIM WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW SAID WELL. RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER AND RESPECT FOR THE INSTITUTION HAVE DIMINISHED AND THEY HAVE OVER THE YEARS. BUT THAT IS NOT MY POINT TO THE CONTRARY. IT IT TYPICALLY HAS STRUCK ME IN THE LAST FEW DAYS HERE. THE QUALITY OF THE DEBATE IN THE COMPARTMENT OF EACH AND EVERY MEMBER OF THE SENATE AND ALMOST WELL I THINK EVERYONE OF YOU HAVE BEEN UP SPEAKING. IT IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE. IN A CAN TO THE BEST OF TIMES THAT I EVER HAVE WITNESSED HERE. SO MY WHOLE PURPOSE ON THIS MOMENT OF TWO ON THE CONDITION THE FILE IS TO COMMENDED COMPLIMENT YOU. OBVIOUSLY ARE STAFF TO THEY ARE ALWAYS WONDERFUL BUT HOW YOU COMPORT YOURSELVES YOUR COMMAND OF THE- YOU RAISED PRESS. JUICE THE FACT THAT YOU SHOW. IS STILL VERY IMPRESSIVE.

THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN. UNDER GROVE. PRESIDENT BY TWO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK A FEW MOMENTS JUST ON PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR YOU KNOW I LOOK AT THE WE ALL CAME INTO OFFICE THE IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN- HERE AND SOME OF YOU WERE HERE BUT WE STARTED THIS SESSION INTO EIGHTEEN IN LAST- WHEN WE FINISH THE LAST FEW DAYS OF CYCLE IT WAS THE MOST FUN TIME ALRIGHT RIGHT REMEMBER. YEAH THIS CHAIN INTO A SMALL LITTLE ROOM AND SITTING ON OUR CHAIRS WITH ALL OF OUR DOCUMENTS IN FRONT OF US AND- THE DESK STAFF AND ERICA DID SUCH AN OUTSTANDING JOB. IN IN THIS YEAR WE THOUGHT TWENTY TWENTY WILL START OFF IN THE MUCH BETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS YEAR. AND WE ENDED UP WITH CALVIN BEING GONE FOR ALMOST THREE MONTHS AND BE AWAY FROM THE CAPITAL. AND COMING BACK TO. WHERE WE HAVE TO OPERATE A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT AND- ERICA HAS DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STAFF AND- ALL OF US ARE SAFE. I SOMETIMES THINK SHE'S GONE OVERBOARD AND I VOICE MY CONCERN WITH THAT. BUT SHE STILL HOLD THEIR GROUND IN AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL FOLLOW THE RULES AND EVERYBODY'S SAFE. AND BERNIE AT THE DESK JUST AN OUTSTANDING INDIVIDUAL WHO MAKE SURE THE HOUSE RUNS. VERY SMOOTHLY THE- FLOOR EARLY MAJORITY FLOOR LEADER AT THE WIND HE COMES UP AND WE COME UP WITH SOME CRAZY IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN MOVE THINGS ALONG AND MAKE THINGS A LITTLE BETTER AND- IN BERNIE JUST LOOKS AT US AND ROLES ARE. SOMETIMES BUT SHE ALWAYS MANAGES TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS. WE CAN EXPEDITE AS THINGS THAT HAPPEN ON THE FLOOR. AND SO I JUST THINK THAT LEADERSHIP IN THE STAFF AND- WHEN I THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW EVEN OUR BUDGET CHAIR WHO IS LIKE SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES SAID VERY VERY GOOD.

THERE'S ALL THESE MEN THAT HAVE BEEN IN THAT POSITION AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU SEE LAST PHOTO IT. IN THE IN THE ROW IS A WOMAN. SO AS I APPLIED ERICA BERNIE MYSELF ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. THE BUDGET CHAIR IN THE STATE PRO. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE ARE. NO TH. GUYS BUT THIS HOUSES OP. VERY SMOOTHLY AND IN A DIFFERENT WAY BECAUSE WOMEN. ARE IN CHARGE AND. I WANT TO SEE- MY REPUBLICAN STAFF YOU KNOW OF A- COUNTRY TO BEING IN THE MAJORITY PARTY REPUBLICAN SEEM TO GET INFORMATION ON THE BUDGET EITHER FROM LOBBYIST OR THE MEDIA. THAT'S OUR SENSE OF RESOURCE TO BE ABLE TO GET INFORMATION ON MY STAFF HAS DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB TO GARNER THAT INFORMATION AND THEN WE ACTUALLY DO GET THE LANGUAGE AT THE LAST MINUTE THEY ARE ABLE TO PUT THOSE THINGS TOGETHER.
