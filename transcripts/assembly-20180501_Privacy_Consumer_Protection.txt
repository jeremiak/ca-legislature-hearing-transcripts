A GOOD AFTERNOON I LIKE TO CALL TO ORDER THE MEETING OF THE. PRIVACY COMMITTEE OF LAW MAY FIRST TWENTY EIGHTEEN SINCE WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM YEAH WE LIKE TO START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. AND OUR FIRST ONE UP BY. NOW WE HAVE MR COURT YEAH. HE HAS AB SEVENTEEN FORTY TWO. WELCOME. ANYTIME YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND MISTER VICE CHAIR. VERY NICE TO START A HEARING ON TIME I LOVE IT. FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND MARK I STAFF WHO ARE CLOSE TOGETHER ON THE BILL WE CERTAINLY ARE. CHEAP DO WE HAVE SPECIFIC COMMITTEE OF. NOW. OKAY WE TOOK CARE A YOUR COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AS AUTHOR. LA AMENDMENTS ALREADY SO WE HAVE MADE THE CHANGES THAT TO YOUR STAFF CORRECTLY I SUGGESTED THANK YOU. ARE AB SEVENTEEN FORTY TWO MAKE IT EASIER FOR CALIFORNIANS TO FREEZE THEIR CREDIT HISTORY. PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THEFT AND FRAUD. EVERY YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS STOLEN FROM MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TO DATA BREACHES. LAST YEAR EQUIFAX ATTACKED ONE OF THE THREE. CONSUMER CRIME. WHICH IS ONE OF THE THREE. CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES. AND. IT. OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE MILLION AMERICANS LOST. THAT LOST THEIR PRIVACY FURTHER I CAN TELL YOU THAT RIGHT AFTER THAT ONE OF MY. CREDIT CARD STARTED TO BE USED IN OHIO A PLACE THAT I WAS NOT YET. SO IT'S IT'S SERIOUS WHEN THIS HAPPENS CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT THEMSELVES WITH CREDIT FREEZES WHICH CAN PREVENT A CRIMINAL FROM OPENING UP FRAUDULENT CREDIT LINES AND THAT'S ALSO HAPPENED TO ME. THE FREEZE PROCESS HOWEVER IS COMPLICATED AND ARCANE AB SEVENTEEN FORTY TWO WOULD PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S BY ALLOWING THEM TO PLACE ONE CALL. OR MAKE ONE ELECTRONIC REQUEST TO FREEZE THEIR CREDIT AT ALL CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES. THE SAME SIMPLE PROCESS WOULD APPLY THE TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT ON FREEZES. WITH ME TODAY US MARINES MARINE MAHONEY ON BEHALF CONSUMERS UNION. MARINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH EFFORTS WHEN THIS PLACE GO AHEAD. MY NAME IS. MAUREEN MAHONEY AND THEY WORK FOR CONSUMERS UNION WHICH IS THE ADVOCACY DIVISION OF CONSUMER REPORTS MAGAZINE. WITH DATA BREACHES UNFORESEEN BECOMING AN ALL TOO COMMON NEED TO SPEAK MORE DIRECTLY. FOUND. WITH DATA BREACHES BECOMING UNFORTUNATELY AND ALL TOO COMMON PHENOMENON. CONSUMERS ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO IDENTITY THEFT THAN EVER. BUT IT CAN BE A HASSLE FOR CONSUMERS TO SET UP SECURITY FREEZES WHICH PREVENTS THE USE FROM OPENING UP NEW CREDIT ACCOUNTS IN THEIR NAME. AND STICKING THEM WITH THE BILL. PROTECT THEMSELVES CONSUMERS NEED TO BE ABLE THE SET UP FREEZES WITH EACH OF THE THREE MAJOR BUREAUS QUICKLY AND EASILY. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SUPPORTING THIS SPELL IT REQUIRES A THREE MAJOR BUREAUS TO FORWARD. THE REQUEST FOR SECURITY FREEZES TO EACH OF THE OTHER MAJOR BUREAUS ENSURING THAT CONSUMERS ARE FULLY PROTECTED FROM NEW ACCOUNT FRAUD. CREDIT YEARS ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY TO COORDINATE SIMILAR REQUESTS FOR EXAMPLE UNDER FEDERAL LAW THEY'RE REQUIRED TO FORWARD REQUEST FOR FRAUD ALERTS TO THE OTHER MAJOR BUREAUS. AND THE PATRONS UNION LOCK PRODUCTS. ALSO ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO SET UP A LOCKED WHICH IS A SIMILAR SERVICE TO A FREEZE WITH BUT THE TRANSUNION AND EQUIFAX CREDIT REPORTS. THIS BILL ALSO SPEED UP THE PROCESS FOR MANAGING CREDIT FREEZES. THIS ENSURES THAT CONSUMERS ARE IMMEDIATELY PROTECTED FROM IDENTITY THEFT AND IT MAKES THEM MORE LIKELY TO USE. CREDIT FREEZES SINCE THEY KNOW THEY WILL RECEIVE IMMEDIATE PROTECTION. CREDIT BUREAUS ARE ALREADY IMMEDIATELY ABLE TO SET UP CREDIT LOCKS AND THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT SAME LEVEL OF SERVICE. FOR SECURITY FREEZES. CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SET THE STANDARD FOR THE NATION TO GUARANTEE CONSUMERS STRONG PROTECTIONS FROM A DONE THE THEFT. THANK YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. TIFFANY MATTHEWS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. CNN OPPOSITION. IS COMING UP. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RAINY POLLOCK AND WE HAVE TO CONSUMER DATA INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. HOW WE ARE HEARING CONTINUE OPPOSITION BUT WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND ALSO SOME WOMEN QUIRK IN A STAFF AND COMMITTEE STAFF? PERSISTING US IN TRYING TO WORK OUT SOME OF OUR DIFFERENCES WE BELIEVE A LOT OF THE DIFFERENCES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. THE ONE REMAINING ISSUE I JUST WANNA RAISE HIS OF COURSE IS THE SHARING OF INFORMATION AMONG THE DIFFERENT HEROES. OTHERS TO ISSUES THAT WE SEE THERE ONE IT'S A TECHNOLOGY ABOUT TRYING TO SET UP A SYSTEM WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE FRAUD ALERT SYSTEM DOES BEEN SET UP. HOWEVER THAT WAS SET UP THROUGH A CONGRESSIONAL ACTION IT TOOK. NO SOMETIME TO GET A SYSTEM SET UP TO TRY TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION. BUT THE BIGGEST PART ABOUT SHARING INFORMATION IS THAT EACH OF THE BUREAU'S WANT TO AUTHENTICATE THEIR OWN INFORMATION. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN DATA SET. SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT PERSON. I AND I THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT SORT OF AN EXAMPLE LIKE THIS AND AND I THINK IT'S ALMOST LIKE AN ASSEMBLY HEARING WHERE WE HAVE A HEARING LIKE THIS TODAY. NO WHY SHOULD THE SENATE BRING IN WITNESSES WHY DON'T WE JUST SEND OVER THE TRANSCRIPT AND LET THEM DECIDE BASED UPON THE TRANSCRIPT. IT'S VERY SIMILAR HERE BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THE SENATE WANTS TO ASSN ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET THE ANSWERS THAT THEY NEED. WE WANT THE SAME THING TO OCCUR IN THIS PROCESS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD THE IDENTIFIED INDIVIDUAL THAT HE WHO SAYS WHO HE IS. TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO LIABILITY AND ARE PART. ADDITIONALLY UNDER THE LAW WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO PROVIDE EACH CONSUMER WITH INFORMATION ABOUT HOW A FREEZE WORKS AND ALSO A PASSWORD AND A PEN. SO THE QUESTION HERE IS WHAT WHAT DO WE DO IN THAT CASE SO FOR EXAMPLE THE EXPERIENCE SENDS US OVER INFORMATION TO TRAINED UNION ST WEEK AND HAVE TO PUT IN A FREEZE. WE STILL HAVE TO NOTIFY THE CONSUMER ABOUT GIVING THEM A PASSWORD. AND OR ATTEND AND PROVIDE THEM HOW THE FREEZE WORKS AS WELL BECAUSE THAT'S WAIT STATED IN THE LAW. SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON A WE ARE GOING TO SEVEN MEETING WITH SOMEONE IN QUIRK I IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS TO HAVE OUR EXPERTS TALK TO MOVE A BIT FURTHER ABOUT THIS ISSUE. OR HOPEFULLY IN THE FUTURE BE ABLE TO RESOLVE THESE CONCERNS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF BEFORE WE GO TO OUR NEXT WITNESS SO LET'S ESTABLISH A QUORUM MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE KALRA. CHILD HERE. KILEY NEAR. BAKER I HERE. BERMAN. CALDERON. IRWIN. YEAH MULLIN. OBERNOLTE HERE. REYES HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A ADDITIONAL WITNESSES SO IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE. COME FORWARD. SEEING NONE LETTERS SOBRE BRING BACK TO OUR COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. UNLESS BAKER GO AHEAD THINK YOU JUST VERY GRATEFUL. MISTER QUICK THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION I THINK THEY'VE OF. FIRST WHEN I SAW THE RISEN AT REQUIREMENT THAT A COMPANY SHARE WITH OTHER COMPANIES INFORMATION WE DON'T SEE THAT REQUIREMENT IN LAW VERY OFTEN COURSE THE NOTIFICATION OF CREDIT HISTORY IN THE ALERTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS I. THINK THERE'S A CASE TO BE MADE THERE IT'S IT IS VERY IMPORTANT AYE AYE. STRONGLY ENCOURAGED THAT TO BE WORKED OUT NINE GRATEFUL YOU'RE DOING THAT PLEASE JUST YOUR BILL BASED ON THAT SIR THANK YOU. ANSWER MISTER OPEN I THINK AHEAD. WHAT ECHO THOSE COMMENTS I THINK NORMALLY UP I'M NOT A BIG PROPONENT OF THE LEGISLATURE REGULATING INDUSTRY IN UNLESS IT'S REALLY REQUIRED BUT? I CREDIT REPORTING IS SO CENTRAL TO PEOPLE'S ACCESS TO MODERN DAY COMMERCE THAT I THINK THAT WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO EXERCISE SOME CONTROL OVER THAT AND SO. A LOT LIKE TO TAKE YOU FROM IT BRING THE BILL FOR NAUGHT MAP IS SUPPORTED. THANK YOU. EVERY SAY DITTO TO THAT AND I WILL ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION IN. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT AREA IN FACT I HAVE ANOTHER BILL ALSO. ON A TO TACKLE THIS SEEMED SAME PROBLEM IN AND I'M GLAD THAT THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OPPOSITION AND. OF THIS IS A VERY GOOD THE CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL SO. WITHOUT AYE YOU FEEL FREE UFIDA CLOSE OR IT'S JUST NOT AS YET. I PROBABLY PUBLISHED QUIT WHILE I'M AHEAD BUT I. I WILL SAY THAT IT'S BEEN A REAL PLEASURE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. ARM. SO THE FIRST THING THEY BROUGHT UP WITH THE TIMING I THINK WE'VE GOT THAT RESOLVED. AND SO THIS QUESTION OF AUTHENTIC AUTHENTICATION ET CETERA OUT WE DEFINITELY WE WILL BE WORKING ON THAT WE HAVE ARRANGED A TELECONFERENCE WITH SOME OF THE TECHNICAL PEOPLE. ARE AND I WILL TRY AND HAVE. EXPERTS FROM CONSUMER UNION I HOPE THAT YES YOUR YEAR THERE THAT TOO GOOD. SO ARM WHY I'VE DONE THIS IN OTHER CASES AND. DEALING WITH ENGINEERS IS ALWAYS SOMETHING I'M VERY PLEASED TO DO SO THANK YOU AND ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THEY GET THERE MADAM SECRETARY. I NEED A MOTION ALSO. THE BILL IS MINUTES TO HAVE A SECOND.

WITH LARGE SCALE DATA BREACHES LIKE THE EQUAL FACTS BREACH BECOMING THE NORM OUR RESPONSE TO IDENTITY THEFT MUST BE THOUGHTFUL. BUT THEY TO BREACH NOTIFICATIONS PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION INCLUDING THE CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THE CONSUMER CREDIT REPORT AGES REPORTING AGENCIES THEY DO NOT DESCRIBE THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOL. TO BET THAT PREVENT FINANCIAL FRAUD WHICH. WE BELIEVE IS A SECURITY FREEZE WITH THIS BILL CALIFORNIANS WHO SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN STOLEN WILL BE AWARE THAT CREDIT FREEZES ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM. AND THEY CAN MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ON HOW THEY WANT TO PROTECT THEIR. OF FINANCIAL FUTURE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. PLEASE COME ON UP.

ALEX BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MISTER OBERNOLTE GO AHEAD. SO WHEN I. IN SUPPORT OF YOUR BILL. JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS OBVIOUSLY IF THE PREVIOUS BUILT ARTWORKS BILL WERE TO PASS YOU DID SOME CHATTERING OUT. AMENDMENTS TO AVOID CONFLICTS WITH THAT HOWEVER. YOU'VE GOT SOME LANGUAGE IN YOUR BILL THAT I FEAR WOULD NOT BE SOLVED WITHOUT SHATTERING OUT OF LEMONS AND THAT'S RELATED TO THE FACT THAT OF THE REQUEST. TO CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY FOR SECURITY FREEZE WOULD HAVE TO BE IN WRITING. AND. SO I I WOULD. ENCOURAGE YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS IN WRITING OR ELECTRONIC. JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW THAT CONSUMERS ARE OF PRESERVE THE RIGHT TO DO THAT. AND AND THAT WAS. TAKEN CARE OF IN THE. AMENDMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS THAT MANAGER TAKING TODAY. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION CHAIR AND IGNORANT RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE VERY GOOD. THE RECOMMENDATION IS SAID TO PASS. AND ALL I NEED A MOTION FOR THE BILL. THE BILLS AND SECOND IT. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SHALL I HIGH KILEY. AYE BAKER. AYE BERMAN. AYE CALDERON. IRWIN AYE. AYE LOW IN. OBERNOLTE I REYES. I T.. THAT SEVEN YOUR BILL IS ALL SEVEN ZERO. AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE UP YOUR OTHER BILL NOW A. B. NINETEEN OH SIX THIS ITEM TO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS BILL HAS BEEN A PRODUCT OF EXTENSIVE COLLABORATION BY MY OFFICE AND THE TECH INDUSTRY TO ADDRESS A CRITICAL CYBERSECURITY PROBLEM. ONE THAT IS ONLY FORECASTED TO GET WORSE THIS BILL REQUIRES MANUFACTURERS TO EQUIP CONNECTED DEVICES WITH REASONABLE SECURITY FEATURES APPROPRIATE TO THE DEVICE TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED REMOTE ACCESS OR USE. ON OCTOBER TWENTY FIRST TWENTY SIXTEEN THE WRY BOTNET TOOK DOWN MAJOR PARTS OF THE INTERNET FOR NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE. THE PLAN OF THE HACKERS WAS INUNDATED INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDED BY DYING. REFERRED TO AS A. DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS STOPPING INTERNET ACTIVITY FREEZING ONLINE COMMERCE AND THREATENING THE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE COME TO RELY ON. THIS ATTACK AND OTHER SHOWS THAT BUSINESS AS USUAL IS NOT WORKING AND THOUGH WE HAVE HEARD FROM MANY IN THE INDUSTRY. THAT SAME PER FOR SELF REGULATION AND WE THINK IT IS TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE A MINIMAL LEVEL OF AND SECURITY. THE NUMBER OF AYE A TWO DEVICES HAS ALSO EXPLODED OVER THE LAST YEAR FEW YEARS AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS DESCRIBES. AT ESTIMATES FROM FIFTY BILLION DEVICES BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO ONE TRILLION DEVICES BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THESE CONNECTED DEVICES PROVIDE MANY BENEFITS TO CONSUMERS BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTS BY ALLOWING MORE INSIGHT AND CONTROL TO ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER THERE ARE RISKS BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND FOR SOCIETY WITH THE WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF THESE DEVICES. AS ANYBODY THAT HAS EVER STRUGGLED TO SET UP A. TV ROUTER OR OTHER SMART DEVICE THERE'S AN INCENTIVE FOR COMPANIES TO CREATE. DEVICES THAT ARE PLUG AND PLAY. THIS USUALLY MEANS SECURITY IS EITHER NOT INCLUDED OR IS A LATER OPTION THAT THE SAVVY CONSUMER CAN ENABLE. WITH LITTLE TO NO SECURITIES HACKERS HAVE FOUND A GOLD MINE IN I OR T. DEVICES WHICH THEY IN FACT. AND THEN STRING TOGETHER. INTO BOUGHT NETS TO DO THEIR BIDDING FOR THE MORE I BOUGHT THAT I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF MY REMARKS THE DEVICES WERE PRINTERS SECURITY CAMERAS HOME ROUTERS AND BABY MONITORS. IT IS MY HOPE WITH THIS BILL THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET IN FRONT OF THE WAVE OF BILLIONS OF CONNECTED DEVICES AND MAKE SURE THAT THE ONES BEING SOLD IN CALIFORNIA. ARE REASONABLY SECURE. I UNDERSTAND THAT ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THIS NEW REQUIREMENT MAY TAKE TIME AND ADDITIONAL EFFORT BY MANUFACTURERS TO INCREASE SECURITY OF THEIR PRODUCTS. WHY DO NOT WANT TO DELAY ANY LONGER THAN IS NECESSARY AS? BECAUSE BECAUSE THE RISK TO PUBLIC ONLY INCREASES WITH EVERY NEW I OR T. DEVICE CONNECTED EFFORTS TO APPROPRIATELY. SECURE DEVICES SHOULD BE. ACCOMMODATED THAT IS WHY I'M COMMITTING TO AMEND INTO THE BILL A ONE YEAR DELAY. OF THE EFFECTIVE A DATE MAKING THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL IF IT ACTED TO GO INTO A FACT AND ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. I BELIEVE THAT WITH THE EXTENSIVE WORK WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN WITH THE TECH INDUSTRY AND OTHER PARTNERS ON THIS BILL. THIS COULD BE A MODEL TO EXPORT TO OTHER STATES AND SECURE ALL SMART HOMES AND SMART CITIES FROM BRING BEING LEVERAGED AGAINST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH EFFORTS WHEN IS PLEASE. MISTER CHAIRMAN REYES LARA BUT IT WITH TECH NEXT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN OPPOSE LET'S AMENDED POSITION BUT WITH HIM AM IS THAT MR OUR WHEN JUST EXPLAIN WITH A DELAY IMPLEMENTATION DATE WE ARE MOVING OUR OPPOSITION WILL SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WE HAVE EIGHTY PERCENT A EIGHTEEN PLUS MEMBERS IN OUR ASSOCIATION WE HAVE VARIOUS AYE ANTI DEVICES BEING DESIGNED FOR CONSUMERS TODAY AND WE BELIEVE THIS WE SAW MEASURE MOVING FORWARD WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR NEXT WITNESS PLACE. THAT CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE I AT THE TIME I LETTER WAS DUE FOR BAD WE WERE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHORED THANK HER FOR WORKING WITH US FOR MONTHS ON THIS BILL TO MAKE IT WORKABLE. AND WITH THESE RECENT AMENDMENTS AT THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA BE REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION AND WE'LL BE TALKING WITH OUR MEMBERS TO SEE IF WE CAN GET TO A POSITION OF SUPPORT. I THINK YOU'RE MY CHILD. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. RESEARCHER MEMBERS CHRIS MCKINLEY ON BEHALF OF THE COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WE JOINED THE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. BY AS SOON AS THE AMENDMENTS COME I'M SURE WE WILL REVISE THAT POSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT PLEASE. MARGARET WHAT'S IN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION I'LL ECHO THE ROCK REMARKS OF MR MCCAIN WE A BELIEVE WE TOO WILL BE MOVING TO A NEUTRAL POSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU MATCH NEXT PLACE. RIGHT FEELING GRIEVES WITH THE ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WERE ACTUALLY NEUTRAL THE BILL RIGHT NOW WE JUST HAVE SOME REMAINING. ISSUES TO WORK OUT WERE REVIEWING THE LANGUAGE BUT WE'VE HAD A GREAT. A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE AUTHOR WE THANK HER FOR HER TIME WORKING WITH US. THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. GOVERNOR AND ALL DEROGATORY CALIFORNIA LIFE SCIENCES ASSOCIATION. LIKE TO LET MYSELF BECOME IT'S MAD MAD I THINK THE AUTHOR HERSELF FOR WORKING WITH US. THANK YOU MITCHELL ADDITIONAL WITNESSES EITHER IN SUPPORT OR IN OPPOSITION PLEASE STEP FORWARD HAMM KEVIN MASTERMAN THE ASSOCIATION OF HOME APPLIANCE MANUFACTURERS. SO. WE APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS FOR THE AUTHOR TO TO TALK TO EVERYONE ABOUT THIS INCLUDING US. WE STILL OPPOSE THIS BILL IT'S. FOR A FEW REASONS OUT JUST BRIEF BRIEF ONE IS. IT'S HARD JUST LEGISLATIVE LEAD TO IT TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES BECAUSE. THE LAW MOVES SLOWER THAN TECHNOLOGY SO WE DON'T DISAGREE THAT THERE'S AN ISSUE AND WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT INDUSTRY SHOULD SELF REGULATE. WE'RE SAYING THE BETTER AVENUE IS A. THIRD PARTY STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION WHICH DOES THIS ALL THE TIME IS MORE NIMBLE AND WERE QUICKLY CAN ADDRESS THE INNOVATIVE NEED SO WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS BILL. GOES TOO FAR OR NOT FAR ENOUGH OR COULD HAMPER THINGS THE OTHER THING IS TOM PROBABLY WHY YOU SEE SOME INDUSTRY DIVIDED BECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE THE ONLY BILL THE. ONLY INDUSTRY MAKE REAL OF MANUFACTURES OF MAKE THEIR PRODUCT AND SELL THEM OF THE BRAND THE WAY THE MANUFACTURES TO FIND. ONLY IMPACTS MANUFACTURERS WHO ARE OEMS ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS WHO ALSO SELL THEIR PRODUCT IF THE SOURCE YOUR PRODUCT IN CHINA OR SOMEWHERE ELSE THEN PUT YOUR BRAND ON IT THEN THE WAY THE MANUFACTURES DEFINED COULD NOT BE IMPACTED SO. FOR US IT HITS HOME BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY IMPACTS US. THE REASONABLE SECURITY STANDARD THAT'S JUST A LAWYER'S DREAM AND. AND PEOPLE CAN THAT'LL JUST OPEN US TOO LEGIT LITIGATION AND UNCERTAINTY. AND BY HAVING THE SAFE HARBOR ISSUES WHERE YOU HAVE A PASSWORD THE PASSWORD MIGHT ALREADY BE OBSOLETE NOW HAVE FINGERPRINT AND FACIAL RECOGNITION SO. WE DON'T TO BE LOCKED INTO A SAFE HARBOR THAT MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE THE BEST AUTHENTICATION AND. AND PROTECTION BECAUSE WE HAVE TO STAY ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE BAD GUYS AND LOCKING IT IS NOT HELPFUL. LAST POINT IS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE A FISCAL NOTE THIS'LL OBVIOUSLY IS BEING FORCED BY THE CALIFORNIA AG AND SO THERE'S FISCAL IMPACTS SO. IT WOULD HAVE A FISCAL. IMPACT THAT SHOULD BE SHOULD BE DEALT WITH BY THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. HAVE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. BUT THINK TO THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE AUTHOR ENTER STAFF FOR THE WORK THAT SHE'S DONE ON THIS BILL SO FAR. NOT MANY MISTRAL COOK I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL UNLESS IT IS AMENDED TO DO TWO THINGS. FIRST CREATE A MORE PRECISE DEFINITION A MANUFACTURER. SECOND PROVIDE MANUFACTURERS NOTICES TO WHAT IT WOULD REQUIRED OF THEM BY GRANTING AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE FOR THOSE THAT CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY'VE RESEARCH SECURITY. FEATURES AND IMPLEMENTED IT NEEDS TO SECURE DEVICES BASED ON THAT RESEARCH BUT WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM WE WE DISAGREE ABOUT THE NATURE SO THE SOLUTION MANUFACTURERS ARE NOT THE BAD ACTORS HERE. WE'RE LEADING THE DEVELOPMENT OF CYBERSECURITY SOLUTIONS AT THE TABLE EVERY STANDARD DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION AND PUBLIC PRIVATE SEE. CYBERSECURITY COLLABORATION THE PROBLEM IS AS WE SECURE DEVICES THERE ARE BAD ACTORS THEY'RE KEEPING PACE AND DEVELOPING EQUAL MORE SOPHISTICATED TOOLS TO HACK THEM. WE BELIEVE THE FOCUS SHOULD BE. TOWARD STOPPING THEM NOT IMPOSING A STICK PARA SANCTIONS AND POTENTIALLY ARBITRARY STANDARDS ON THE VICTIMS A A. B. NINETEEN OH SIX INVITES US DOWN THIS ROAD. OF ARBITRARY STANDARDS SETTING WITH ITS REASONABLE TEST OF OF SECURITY FEATURES BUT WITH ALL THIS VERY THING IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WITH THE CALVARY ATTORNEY GENERAL LEASES DATA BREACH RESPONSE REPORT. IN AT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL USED ITS ENFORCEMENT POWER TO PICK A SET OF STANDARDS AND SEE THAT ANYTHING LESS THAN THE STANDARDS WOULD BE DEEMED UNREASONABLE. A THIS SORT OF INFLEXIBLE ARBITRARY STANDARD SETTING WITHOUT DELIBERATE OF LEGISLATIVE PROCESS OR PUBLIC NOTICE AND COMMENT IS SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE AGREES IS THE WRONG WAY TO GO HOWEVER AB NINETEEN OH SIX AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN CREATES A PARALLEL STRUCTURE THAT'LL GET US HERE FIVE. SEVEN TEN YEARS DOWN THE ROAD. SO ARMAMENT IS A COMPROMISE. THAT GETS US CLOSE TO SOLVING THE PROBLEM WE LEAVE THE REASONABLENESS FRAMEWORK AS IT'S WRITTEN INTACT BUT. WE PROVIDE CERTAINTY FOR MANUFACTURERS. THAT CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY DID WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT THEY HAVE. EITHER FOLLOWED INDUSTRY STANDARDS ARE INNOVATIVE NEW AND BETTER STANDARDS. AND AND PROVIDES THEM AND SAFETY AND SECURITY THEY WILL BE HELD IN THE COURT INTO GOTCHA LITIGATION OR FORSMAN ACTIONS SO. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'LL STOP THERE AND LEAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MORE TECHNICAL AYE. DEFINITION. IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. BUT WILL ASK THAT YOU THAT THE AUTHOR CONSIDER ARMAMENTS. INNING ENCOURAGE US TO GET TO A. EQUITABLE SOLUTION FOR ALL PARTIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON DANIEL KENDALL KAISER ON BEHALF OF THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AND PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. TAX. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. A MISTAKE AGO AT THANK YOU. THANK YOU I DO HAVE A QUESTION CERTAINLY FOR THE AUTHOR THIS POINT OF THE DEFINITION OF MANUFACTURE IN THE CONCEPT THAT. AN OEM. COULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAN IF YOU MAY HAVE YOUR REFRIGERATOR THAT CAN CONNECT TO THE INTERNET MADE. IN ANOTHER COUNTRY AND THEN BRANDED AND SELL IT HERE. THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION IS EVER IF YOU CAN HELP BY NOW THAT WAS THAT'S NOT OUR INTENTION OF AND AND SO THIS IS A MATTER OF. DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF HEALTH THE WORDING IS AND WE HAVE EVERY INTENTION TO. TIGHTEN THAT UP UNTIL AND AND AND. YOU KNOW TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE WOULD CERTAINLY IN THE ANALYSIS IT WASN'T A READ THAT WAY THINK YOU AND I ENCOURAGE IF YOU'RE GOING BACK TO THE. DISCUSSION AND CONVERSATIONS TO SEE WHAT ELSE CAN BE DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ISN'T THAT WHAT. SOUNDS LIKE A GAPING PROBLEM BUT IT COULD PROBABLY BE FAXED. M.. SECONDLY IS OFTEN WHEN YOU SEE A REASONABLENESS STANDARD AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. YOU DO YOU WANT TO PUT INTO LAW AYE FLEXIBILITY. BUT THE THE PRACTICALITY OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE HAS A LAWSUIT THEY CAN THEN SUE A COMPANY FOR TO AND THEN TEST IF IT'S A REASONABLE IT'S A QUESTION OF FACT THAT GOES BEFORE A JUDGE OR A JURY. WHICH IS POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS INTO A COURT PROCESS EVEN AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. WHILE. GENERALLY GET SOMEBODY OUT OF COURT. SO I'M THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT THE SAFE HARBOR MIGHT BE A GOOD WAY TO GO BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU CAN HELP US. AT LEAST GIVE SOME AREAS WHERE YOU CAN BYPASS. A THE COURT AND. YOU KNOW TO IN A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND THAT AT TRIAL. THAT IT AND THAT CYBER COST TO GO TO DETERMINE IF THERE'S BEEN A REASONABLE ACTIONS TAKEN. THE FLIP SIDE THE SAFE HARBOR CAN ALSO BE TO. EITHER DAVID OR INFLEXIBLE SO THAT IT'S REALLY NOT A SAFE HARBOR. AND MY CONCERN JUST SEEN HOW. AND I I'D LIKE YOUR BILL I LIKE WHAT IT'S DOING I WANT PROFITS THAT. THEY CAN YOU VISIT ALL ABOUT YOUR INTEREST IN MAKING THIS A SAFE HARBOR MORE FLEXIBLE OR AT THE SUGGESTION OF AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE ATTRACT LEVEL SURPRISED ABOUT HIS HERE. THAT THAT ONLY AGAIN YOU HAVE TO GET THE COURT OR. SOMEONE TO AGREE TO THE FACT THAT THE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE APPLIES IN THAT'S EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. CAN YOU VISITED ALL ON YOUR INTEREST AND I'M WILLINGNESS TO TRY TO MAKE IT IMPROVE THOSE TO REDUCE LITIGATION COSTS. A SO ON A SAFE HARBOR ISSUE. THERE WAS SOME CONSENSUS BETWEEN US AND. THAT THE. COMMITTEE STAFF THAT THAT THERE WAS A SAFE HARBOR CREATED WE TRY TO TIGHTEN UP THE LANGUAGE TO MAKE THAT. A NOT BE THE CASE BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT WAS ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY AND THAT WE WERE NOT LOCKED INTO. FORCING. DEVICE MANUFACTURERS TO USE A PASSWORD WHEN THERE ARE VERY MANY OF MORE ADVANCED METHODS THAT THEY CAN USE AND AND AGAIN IF WE RAN THIS BY. MANY MANY COMPANIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE WERE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH. IN. IN IN THAT AREA AND. AS FAR AS A REASONABLE THE REASONABLE STANDARD GET THE STANDARD REASONABLE NO STANDARD WE DID USE THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THAT WE HAD FLEXIBILITY AND SO. WHILE IT DOES CARRY WITH IT CERTAIN UNCERTAINTY IT IT'S THE UNCERTAINTY THAT ALLOWS US TO EMBRACE INNOVATION AND NEW TECHNOLOGY DOWN THE ROAD AND. WE THINK A COMPANY SHOULD BE EXPLAINED ABLE TO EXPLAIN TO ITS CONSUMERS WHY IT'S CHOICES RELATED TO SECURITY ARE REASONABLE. AND APPROPRIATE TO THE DEVICE AT THEY ARE SELLING AND I THINK THAT IS FAIR FOR A COMPANY TO EXPLAIN TO ITS CONSUMERS ULTIMATELY IF THERE SU THEY HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT TO. YOU KNOW A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE. AND AND LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS LATER YOU MIGHT GET A DETERMINATION OF THAT EITHER IN THE FORM OF A SETTLER CASE AYE. I THINK M. AYE IF IF I COULD. I THOUGHT I'D OFFER TWO CENTS ON THIS PART IS. AT A CERTAINLY A SAFE HARBOR THAT'S FLEXIBLE BUT THAT DOESN'T ESSENTIALLY MEAN ANOTHER PATH IT HAS TO BE LITIGATED. TWO THREE YEARS THROUGH COURT THAT IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND AND THE SAFE HARBOR THAT IS SUFFICIENTLY. HELPFUL SO THAT GOOD ACTORS REALLY DO HAVE A SAFE HARBOR AND. AYE ABSURDLY SUPPORTING THIS TODAY I JUST DO HAVE THAT CONCERN ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF MANUFACTURE YOU VERY ADDRESS THAT. AND HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS REALLY TO NOT BE RESOLVED UNTIL VERY LATE IN THE TRIAL PROCESS IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE THANK YOU AND I. LATELY AGREE WITH YOUR CONCERNS AND WE WILL AND DEFINITELY KEEP WORKING. WITH THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS TO MINIMIZE THAT POSSIBILITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR OBERNOLTE. I WOULD ECHO THEIR CONCERNS BY REYES BY ASSEMBLY WOMAN BAKER UP HAPPY BIRTHDAY BY THE WAY. WELL. YOU SINGING BUT YOU KNOW MY CONCERNS REALLY IT IS SOMEONE THAT THAT'S BEEN IN THE. TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY. MY CONCERNS REVOLVE AROUND THE DEFINITION OF REASONABLE AND YOU'VE GONE OUT OF YOUR WAY IN THE RECITALS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT AUTHENTICATION MEANS WHAT A CONNECTED DEVICE IS WHAT A MANUFACTURING IS. WHAT A SECURITY FEATURE IS AND I REALLY THINK THAT IT'S MISSING A SECTION THAT DEFINES WHAT REASONABLE IS BECAUSE THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO? IS PUT A WORD WITH NO TECHNICAL MEETING IN THERE AND LEAVE IT UP TO ROOMS FULL OF LAWYERS ARGUE ABOUT WHAT'S REASONABLE MUST NOT RUN REASONABLE SO. THESE SOLUTIONS THAT WAS OFFERED BY THE OPPOSITION I THINK. NO MIGHT SOLVE THEIR PROBLEM SOMEONE ENCOURAGE USE THE BILL MOVES FORWARD HERE TO TO MAYBE CONSIDER PUTTING THAT ON. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. SO FIGURE MUCH MISS MULLIN. THINKING WE SHARED FAME IS OFFERING THE BILL I JUMPED INTO THE CONVERSATION MIDSTREAM HERE. I DID WE RESOLVE THE ISSUE AROUND DEFINITIONS. OF MANUFACTURE MY CONCERN IS THAT THE COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE FOR CALIFORNIA HAVE WE. UNRESOLVED THAT IF. WE AND OUR HAVE EVERY INTENTION OF MAKING SURE THE BILL DOES WHAT IT WAS INTENDED TO DO IT WAS NEVER TO DISADVANTAGE. CERTAIN COMPANIES AND SO WHAT WE ARE AND WE NEED TO JUST TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE AND AND. TIGHTEN IT UP BUT THAT IS NOT THE INTENT. BUT I'D FIGURED IT PROBABLY WAS AND JUST WANT TO CLARIFY GOING FOR YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIX THAT DEFINITION. MISTER KILEY CUT. I JUST TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A STEP BACK. IN TRYING TO THINK ABOUT. HOW THIS BILL WOULD WORK IF IT WERE TO BECOME LAW? IS IT YOUR INTENT TO I CREATE A NEW LEGAL DUTY THAT DOESN'T CURRENTLY EXIST. FOR THESE MANUFACTURERS. A NEW LEGAL DUTY. THAT'S RIGHT THAT ARE AS I. YOU KNOW THAT. TO THE WAY THAT THEY HAVE TO AYE APPROACH SECURITY FEATURES. THIS IS. REQUIRING DEVICE MANUFACTURERS TO HAVE SOME SORT OF REASONABLE SECURITY ON THEIR DEVICES SO THAT THEY. ARE I MEAN. THAT AS I MENTION BEFORE WITH THE BIG. BOTNET ATTACK THAT WE HAD. COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IT'S TO PREVENT THOSE TYPE OF THINGS FROM HAPPENING AND AND ALSO. NO PRIVACY PRINT PROTECTION IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THESE DEVICES BEING USED HARNESSED TOGETHER. TO OVERWHELM AND BRING DOWN THE INTERNET BUT IT'S ALSO MAKING SURE THAT. CONSUMERS. ARE NOT EASILY HACKED INTO SO IF YOU HAVE CAMERAS ON YOUR COMPUTERS OR YOU HAVE THE RING DOORBELL JUST MAKING SURE THAT THOSE DEVICES ARE NOT HACKED INTO.THERE IS NO. IT IN GENERAL THERE'S NO MINIMAL SECURITY LEVEL NOW WE DID HAVE THE MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURERS UP AND AND THEY WERE. NEUTRAL ON THE BILL AND IF YOU HAVE AN INDUSTRY THAT ALREADY HAS FEDERAL STANDARDS. THEN THEY CAN ABIDE BY THOSE INSTEAD OF ABIDING BY THAT CALIFORNIA STANDARD BUT WORK FILLING IN WHAT RITE NOW IS A GAPING HOLE. I I GUESS MY QUESTION IS YOU KNOW WE ALL HAVE AT EVERY COMPANY HAS A DUTY I NOT TO CAUSE HARM TO OTHERS THROUGH. UNREASONABLE CONDUCT AND SO. WHAT IS THIS LANGUAGE ADDING TE? THAT EXISTING LEGAL DUTY JUST KIND OF SAYING THAT. A REASONABLE A STANDARD NOW EXIST SPECIFICALLY I WITH RESPECT TO SECURITY FEATURES WITH THEIR CONNECTED DEVICES. WHAT IS THIS ADDING WILL THIS IS ADDING IT IS ADDING THAT REQUIREMENT OBVIOUSLY WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS ALLOWING COMPANIES TO BE COMPLETELY SELF REGULATING ISN'T WORKING SO THERE DOES HAVE TO BE SOME? MINIMAL LEVEL OF REGULATION. RIGHT BUT I MEAN THAT YOU KNOW. A COMPANY CAN BE SUED AS IS. YOU KNOW FOR. THE A IN CONDUCT THAT CAUSES HARM TO CONSUMERS OR TO ANYONE I'VE SHOWN THAT CONDUCT IS UNREASONABLE AND I THINK WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS SAYING IS THAT. THERE'S ALREADY. AN EXISTING DUTY OUTLAW I TO HIGH TO BE REASONABLE. AND SO IF WE WANT TO GIVE THAT FOR THEIR CONTENT. THEN YOU KNOW THAT THE ACTIVITIES OF STANDARD SETTING ORGANIZATIONS MIGHT BE A BETTER WAY TO GO RATHER THAN SORT OF OPENING A NEW. FRONTS. WHAT IS IT IS NOT REASONABLE IN STATUTE THAT WITH THEM LIKELY BL ELABORATED? THROUGH FOR THE REGULATIONS SO WHY WHY IS THIS APPROACH SUPERIOR TO THE ONE THAT THEY'RE PROPOSING. AND. THE IF THEY WOULD PREFER TO USE OF FEDERAL STANDARDS AND THEY HAVE THEIR ORGANIZATION AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT YOU KNOW THEY WORK WITH NEST AND COME UP WITH FEDERAL STANDARDS AND THEY CAN BE. REGULATED. BY THE FEDS BUT RIGHT NOW. MOST DEVICES DO NOT HAVE FEDERAL STANDARDS. BUT DOES THE OPPOSITION JUST WANNA WAY ON THIS WITH RESPECT TO THE ROLE THAT ASK INDUSTRY STANDARD SETTING ORGANIZATIONS COMPLY. SO STANDARDS AND MAYBE IT'S TERMINOLOGY CONFUSION BUT. REGULATIONS VERSUS STANDARD STANDARDS YOU WELL AS A EXAMPLE OF MANY STANDARD TODAY YOU SAFETY STANDARDS AND ON BACK OF MOST COMPUTERS AND EVERYTHING YOU HAVE THAT SO COMPANIES. PUT THE UL STANDARD ON THERE AS A MATT MARKET REALITY. AND THAT STANDARD ORGANIZATION DOES THESE TO CONTINUALLY IS CHANGES AS SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS CHANGE AND GET IMPROVED AND IT'S AN ONGOING PROCESS THAT TYPE OF STANDARD PROCESS THERE'S A U. S. STANDARD FOR SECURITY. THERE'S A NEST PROCESS GOING ON RIGHT NOW FOR PRESS WE'RE JUST SAYING THAT STANDARDS PROCESS NOT OF SELF REGULATED. NOT OUT SOMETHING FROM THE CUSTOMS BORDER PATROL OR HOMELAND SECURITY IT'S A STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS THAT IS USED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. FOR THIS KIND OF EFFORT TO BECAUSE LAWS TAKE TOO LONG FOR EXPENSIVE FOR TECHNOLOGY SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING IS A STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS ALREADY. EXISTS AND THAT IT COULD EVEN BE INTERNATIONALIZE SEE AND YOU REALLY A BROADER CONTROL BUT DOING STATE BY STATE PATCHWORK OF LAWS TO CREATE LITIGATION VULNERABILITIES AND ARE TOO SLOW TO REACT. IN OUR VIEW IS NOT THE IS NOT THE BEST WAY TO DEAL PROTECTION. JUST ONE MORE A QUESTION FROM ISRAEL AND I SEE THERE'S NO NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WHICH I I'M I'M HAPPY ABOUT. I SEE THERE'S NO NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION HERE WHICH I'M HAPPY ABOUT. THERE WAS SOME MENTION OF MAYBE THE AG WILL HAVE SOME ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY HERE I DO YOU THINK THAT'S THE CASE OR DO YOU SEE ANY OTHER ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. BUT THERE IS NO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND YES THE AGE YOU MIGHT HAVE AN ENFORCEMENT BACK. AND WHAT. SO WHAT WHAT OUT OF FORT SMITH ALREADY ENTAIL. I WAS JUST INFORMED THAT IT WAS BNP CODE. SEVENTEEN. TWO HUNDRED. I'M NOT A LAWYER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE ELECTORATE CHIME IN HERE ALSO I I PRESUME THAT MANY MANY OF THE MANUFACTURERS OUT THERE ARE ALREADY PROVIDING SECURITY MEASURES. WHILE OTHERS ARE NOT AT ALL I THINK WITH THIS BILL WILL DO IS ESSENTIALLY SET A BASELINE UPON WHICH DAY BUILT ON WHETHER YOU CALL THOSE TWO CONDITIONS SAFE HARBORS OR. A LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE I THINK THAT BASICALLY SUCH A BASELINE FOR ALL. ON YOU KNOW MANUFACTURES TO COMPLY WITH AND AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW TO ME IT THIS IS A VERY IS GREAT CONCEPT I THINK. YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT WILL PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ALL THESE AYE I'LL TWO DEVICES TO TO BAIT BASICALLY ABIDE BY OUR BECAUSE WE AS YOU MENTIONED WE GONNA SEE BILLIONS OR MAYBE EVEN TRILLIONS OF SENSORS AND. AND. DEVICES TO BE CONNECTED TO THE THE I TT I'LL TEACH. YOU KNOW WITHOUT SOME KIND OF OUR. PROTECTION ON YOU KNOW EVERYBODY COULD POTENTIALLY A RISKS ARE YOU KNOW SECURITY AND I THINK IT THE BILL ALSO IS IN LINE WITH WHAT WE CALL USUALLY. PRIVACY BY DESIGN AND ALSO SECURITY BY DESIGN THE MEETING THAT YOU KNOW FROM THE GET GO MANUFACTURE WOULD INCORPORATE ALL THE SUDDEN ARE YOU KNOW CONCEPTS INTO THE PRODUCT ITSELF. SO THAT THEY WILL BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW SO I THINK I THINK THIS WILL HOW FAR FAR REACHING RAMIFICATIONS. ARE IF WE PROVIDE THE YOU KNOW A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR IT ON IT YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN MENTION ABOUT THOSE TWO CONDITIONS OR. AS SOME HAVE MENTIONED THAT THE SAFE HARBORS AND I THINK WE PROBABLY NEED IN THE FUTURE TO. ARE YOU TO UPDATE THOSE UP. OR MEET THOSE A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE WE DON'T BECAUSE AS YOU MENTION SOMEONE MENTIONED THAT. THE CYBER ALL CRIMINALS ARE GONNA HOUSE MARGO'S IN THE UNIT JUST TO GET AHEAD OF US SO WE NEED TO CONSTANTLY UPDATE THE TO THE SAFE HARBOR OR THAT. THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR. IN THAT REQUIRED SO I'M SIT STILL THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I YOU KNOW IT WOULD ADVISE THAT YOU DO YOU KNOW GOING FORWARD BUT I I THINK THAT. THE BILL DOES PROVIDE THAT KIND OF A BASS LINE OR THRESHOLD FOR. MANUFACTURES TO COMPLY WITH. AND I DO WANT TO MAKE ONE CLARIFICATION IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. AB THE OUR RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS ON THE OF AMENDMENTS REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS ARE AND I HEARD YOU MENTION THAT THAT THE. YOU HAVE ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENT TO THE DELAY IMPLEMENTATION BY ONE YEAR SO WHAT WOULD YOU CONSIDER THAT TO BE PART OF THE AMENDMENT AS WELL IF WE CAN DO THAT RIGHT NOW CERTAINLY. OKAY SO YOU JUST GO FOR THE RECORD YOU KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO BE THE CASE BUT BUT I'M VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT THAT YOU HAVE WITH THE OPPOSITION AND ALL PARTIES I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU YOU DID REACH OUT TO MANY PARTIES. AND TRY TO BUILD CONSENSUS AND I THINK THAT'S VERY ADMIRABLE ON SO. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE I THINK YOU KNOW GOING FORWARD WE MAY NEED TO KIND OF YOU KNOW FINE TUNE A LITTLE BIT MORE. A PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO THOSE TWO ARE JUST SAFE HARBOR LANGUAGE OF A LACK OF BETTER TERM. ON. AND I THINK I'M ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT IN GENERAL AND I HOPE TO YOU KNOW A YOU KNOW TO CAN CONTINUE TO INVOLVED WITH US THE PROCESS AS WELL SO. IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS A. HA I LIKE TO HAVE A MOTION ON. AND. OH YES AND I'LL LET YOU GUYS DO THE CLOSING AS WELL ACTUALLY ASK FOR RIVAL. FIGURE MUCHA MAN SECRETARY PLEASE KALRA. DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR. HI I KILEY. NO. BAKER. I. MEAN I'VE AYE CALDERON. IRWIN CHI I MULLIN AYE AYE OBERNOLTE. NO REYES. I TING. YOU HAVE SIX VOTES OF THE BILL IS OUT CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW THAT BRINGS US TO MISTER OR LEVINE THAT BELIEF YOU HOW OF. ITEM NUMBER THREE THAT'S AB NINETEEN FIFTY. WELCOME ANYTIME YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU SO MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT EIGHTY NINETEEN FIFTY WHICH WOULD REQUIRE WEBSITE OPERATOR. TO DISCLOSE WHETHER THE OPERATOR UTILIZES BOTS TO GATHER PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES THAT FIVE YEARS AGO THIS SAME CODE SECTION WAS AMENDED TO ADDRESS THE NEWER INDUSTRY PRACTICE OR NEW AT THAT TIME. THE USE OF COOKIES. TRACKING COLLECTED DATA AND THE GROWING INDUSTRY PRACTICE OF SHARING INTERNET USAGE DATA WITH THIRD PARTIES. SPECIFICALLY IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AB THREE SEVENTY BY OUR COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MERRITT SUIT SHE. WAS ENACTED TO REQUIRE THAT THE OPERATOR OF A COMMERCIAL WEBSITE OR ONLINE SERVICE DISCLOSE HOW RESPONSE WHAT WEB BROWSERS DO NOT TRACK SIGNAL. THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ANALYSIS OF AB THREE SEVENTY NOTED THE LEGISLATION IS FUNDAMENTALLY A TRANSPARENCY BILL IT DOES NOT REQUIRE WEBSITE I'D REQUIRE WEBSITE OPERATORS TO MAKE ANY AFFIRMATIVE CHANGES. TO THE DATA COLLECTION PRACTICES THE SAME IS TRUE. OF AB NINETEEN FIFTY. I WILL CONCLUDE BY NOTING THAT THE LAST. NOVEMBER GDP OUR REPORT RAN AN ARTICLE TITLED POTS AND PREACHES CLOSING THE SECURITY GAP THE RECOUP THE REPORT HIGHLIGHTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BOTS CONDUCTED. FIFTY TWO PERCENT OF ALL INTERNET TRAFFIC FLOW WITH MORE GROWTH EXPECTED SO THE COMPLEXITY OF SECURITY GROWS THIS MAINLY APPLIES TO BOT DATA TAX BUT IT ALSO APPLIES OF HONOR ABILITIES CREED BY BOUGHT DRIVEN DATA TRANSFERRED. BACK AND FORTH ON COMPANIES INTERNAL NETWORKS THANK YOU I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. OFFERS WHEN A WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE STEP FORWARD. SCENE NINE OPPOSITION. WELCOME. WELCOME. THANK YOU HUTCH HER HER UP SO THAT HIS ACTION. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON MR LEVINE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. SERIBU WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. PRIVACY POLICIES ARE IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS THAT EXPLAIN THE CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION THAT WEB OPERATORS COLLECT ABOUT CONSUMERS IN THE CATEGORIES OF THIRD PARTIES WITH WHOM THEY SHARE THAT INFORMATION. TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS CAN UNDERSTAND PRIVACY POLICIES THEY NEED TO BE AS CLEAR AND CONCISE AS POSSIBLE. THAT'S A POLICY GOAL THAT IT'S BEEN WRITTEN EXPRESSED REPEATEDLY RIGHT HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE. ADDING DISCLOSURES AS TO WHETHER A COMPANY UTILIZES BOTS WOULD LENGTHEN AND CLUTTER PRIVACY POLICIES FOR BENEFIT THAT IS REALLY UNCLEAR. THE LANGUAGE MISTER LEVIN'S REFERRING TO TODAY WOULD BE REQUIRING DISCLOSURE OF BOTS USED TO COLLECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION. AGAIN CURRENT LAW ALREADY REQUIRES. THEM TODAY OPERATORS TO DISCLOSE THE TYPES OF THAT INFORMATION THEY COLLECT AND WHO THEY SHARE IT WITH AND IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW A NOTICE OF. THAT THAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED USING AUTOMATED SOFTWARE AS OPPOSED TO A PERSON IS SOMEHOW MEANINGFUL TO A CONSUMER. THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF WHETHER OR NOT. WEB OPERATOR USED USES BOTS SO THE OPERATOR DOES NOT USE ANY pBOTS THAT HAVE TO DISCLOSE THAT THE PRIVACY POLICY WHICH SEEMS CONFUSING. ON THE BIGGER ISSUES VIRTUALLY EVERY WEB OPERATOR USES IT BOTS IN SOME WAY AND THAT MAKES DISCLOSURES ABOUT THEM. SEEM TO BE IN THIS INSTANCE ESSENTIALLY MEANINGLESS I WOULD RESPECT THE ARGUMENT THIS DISCLOSURE IS ANALOGOUS TO. TO COOKIES. DISCLOSURE ABUSIVE COOKIES WE WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT. IN THAT INSTANCE THAT THE DISCLOSURE ABOUT. OF THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT'S COLLECTED THAT VISITORS. AT THE USERS. THEIR VISITS TO DIFFERENT WEBSITES AND THE TYPES OF ACTIONS THEY TAKE ON THOSE WEBSITES THE LANGUAGE ISSUE HERE THE USE OF BOTS ONLY FOCUSES ON THE METHOD OF COLLECTION. AND THERE'S BEEN NO SHOWING THAT THAT METHOD. IS SOMEHOW NEFARIOUS THOUGH REQUIRING THIS BLANKET DISCLOSURE WOULD CERTAINLY IMPLY THAT. THE REALITY IS THAT THE PROBLEMS WE'VE ALL READ ABOUT THE MEDIA WITH RESPECT TO BOTS INVOLVE THIRD PARTIES UTILIZING BOTS FOR NEFARIOUS PURPOSES. THEY DON'T BOB AUTOMATED SOFTWARE USED BY THE WEB OPERATOR IN CLOSING THE BENEFITS OF THIS BILL SEEM VERY UNCLEAR BUT THE DRAWBACKS OF ADDING UNNECESSARY PROVISIONS TO PRIVACY POLICIES IS SIGNIFICANT SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR. FEAR NO VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. LARA BENNETT WITH TECHNO ASSOCIATE OR COMMENTS WITH THOSE BY COUNTING PER THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. GOVERNOR KILLING THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION ALSO ECHOES COMMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANKS PLEASE. MISTER CHAIR CHRIS MCCARRON ON BEHALF OF THE COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION ALSO POSE THINKS THANK. DANIEL KENDO BECAUSE OUR BEHALF OF THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU MUCH NEXT. MARGARET WAS SAM RAVALLI CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BANKING NETWORK ALSO IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES SEEN AND LOTS OF BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. MISTER OBERNOLTE GO AHEAD. I CARE ABOUT MISTER LEVINE I. UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE I'M CONCERNED WITH HOW BROADLY YOUR BILL DEFINES. THE WORD BOUGHT. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE DEFINITION IS SO BROAD THAT. MOST. SOFTWARE THAT'S DESIGNED FOR INTERACTION WITH THE USER COMMUNITY WOULD FALL UNDER THE DEFINITION OF IT. SO I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE WALL MAY ASK YOU SO IF IF I HAVE MY OWN EMAIL SERVER. AND THE SERVER HAS. THE ABILITY FOR ME TO SET ON AUTO REPLY IF I'M GONNA BE OUT OF TOWN FOR A WEEK. IT SEEMS LIKE THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A BOT UNDER THE DEFINITION OF YOUR BILL IS TO DO WHAT IT OR WHATNOT. I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT WOULD APPLY SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. BIG COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND DOT DISCLOSURE OF THAT SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. JUST BOTS IN GENERAL BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS DOES POINT OUT AND WE. HAVE A THE BILL AS IT IS A BEFORE YOU IS ODD JUST. PASSES A MEANT THAT ARE JUST PASS IT HAD BEEN AMENDED BEFORE COMMITTEE. THE ON HOWEVER THERE ARE AYE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS NOT THAT THE COMMITTEE HAD ASKED ME TO DO TO FURTHER DEFINE WHAT A BOT IS. BUT I WOULD ALSO CONCEDE OUT MUCH LIKE ON A BILL THAT WE HAD BEFORE YOU A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AB TWENTY ONE TWO I WORKED. VERY CLOSELY WITH THE OPPOSITION TO LAND ON DEFINITIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIA DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITY WHICH THIS BILL APPROVED OUR THIS COMMITTEE APPROVED. THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. IN MUCH THE SAME VEIN AND MUCH THE SAME PARTNERSHIP AND IT WITH ALL OF THE BEST GOOD WILL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SOUND POLICY THAT WORKS. OUT TO LAND IN A PLACE THAT WOULD REMOVE THAT OPPOSITION I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THEM OF COURSE BUT WE WOULD THAT WOULD BE MY INTENTION GOING FORWARD. A WE DID A WHOLE THE BILL BACK A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WE WORKED WITH THE COMMITTEE THAT THIS BILL WAS ALSO ASSIGNED TO BUT BECAUSE. WE WOULD HAVE TIME TO GO TO BOTH COMMITTEES WE WORKED WITH. THE INTERNET COMMITTEE. SPORTS TOURISM INTERNET MEDIA COMMITTEE. TO LAND ON THE LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE HERE SO THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE TO BE DOUBLE REFERRED. AS WE WORKED. AS MUCH AS WE COULD WITH THE TWO COMMITTEES TO MAKE IT WORK THAT WE COULD. FURTHER DEFINED THIS BUT I THINK THAT THAT COMMITMENT DOESN'T AND WITH PASSAGE TODAY AND OF COURSE YOUR INPUT WOULD ALSO BE. ARE GLADLY WELCOMED. I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDED I'VE I STILL HAVE. SOME PRETTY MAJOR CONCERNS WITH. THE WAVE DIVIDED AFTER RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE. WITH YOUR INTERPRETATION OF THE BILL BECAUSE I'D KNOW WHERE IN THE BILL TO SAY THAT THE BOT HAS TO COLLECT THE. PERSONAL INFORMATION SO JUST THE FACT THAT ELSEWHERE IN MY COMPANY I COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT. INFORMATION OPENS ME UP TO HAVING TO HAVE THIS DISCLOSURE AND SO MY READING OF THE BILL SAYS THAT. BY IF I HAVE ANY MAIL SERVER YOU KNOW I CAN'T DO AN AUTO REPLY BECAUSE THAT'S A POD. AND SO I I REALLY THINK THAT THAT. WE NEED TO SPEND SOME MORE TIME IN NAILING DOWN THE DEFINITION BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO YEAH TO WORK ON THAT AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TO. TO HELP AND THAT'S WHY I MENTIONED THE. IS SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS THAT WE'RE NOT. ASKED OF ME TO TAKE OUR AMENDMENTS NOT ONLY AM I WILLING TO TAKE THEM IN IN THE FUTURE. UP FOR THE NEXT COMMITTEE BUT ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO REFINE. MS BAKER HAD THANK YOU I'M I SHARE MR OF MINORITIES EXACT CONCERNS BECAUSE THAT I I THINK I'M I'M ASSUMING WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT IS NOT. EFFICIENT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE CONSUMER IN A COMPANY OR RESOURCE RATHER RISE BUT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE DEFINITION GOES AFTER IT DOESN'T LIMIT IT TO PERSONAL INFORMATION. IT'S THE MOST AUTOMATED. EASIEST COMMUNICATIONS WE WOULD HAVE WITH ENTITIES THAT WE DON'T PARTICULARLY THINK WANNA MAKE MORE COMPLICATED. AND. WE ONLY HAVE THE BILL BEFORE US TO VOTE ON TODAY NOT ONES THAT ARE MAYBE AMENDMENTS THERE TAKEN OR NOT AND IT'S GOING ON TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE OTHER ALWAYS APPRECIATE WHEN AUTHORS. REALLY ARE TRYING TO WORK WITHIN THE LEGISLATIVE DEADLINES TO DO THAT. I. IF IT'LL BE REALLY ESSENTIAL I WOULD THINK TO GET THIS. TO GO AFTER THE NEFARIOUS USE YES AND. I I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY IS WHAT'S IN FRONT OF ME HAS. A A DEFINITION THAT IS REALLY. OVER PRIDE AND I THINK YOU YOU'RE RECOGNIZING THAT WITH THE INTEREST IN FIXING AT. THE HOPE THAT WILL HAPPEN. BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF NEFARIOUS. BOTS ARE EVERYONE CALLING OUT THERE. ONE ENCOURAGEMENT IS THAT IN IN THAT DEFINITION BEING CAREFUL NOT TO TOUCH TO MAKE IT SO RIGID THAT TWO YEARS FROM NOW SOME OTHER TERMINOLOGY OR SOME OTHER DEFINITIONS USED IT DOESN'T GO AFTER IT. I'M ALWAYS THE TASK WITH. SOMETHING LIKE THIS IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY AND YOU GET TO DO WHATEVER HE WANTS US. FIGHT EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING YEAH EXACTLY BICU THE. I THINK THAT WE WERE VERY CAREFUL IN THE ORIGINAL BILL. NOT TO BAN THE USE OF POTS. AND THAT IS STILL HERE WE WE DON'T SAY THAT BOTS ARE BAD. ANYWHERE IN MY LEGISLATION WE DON'T LIMIT THE USE OF POTS WE ACTUALLY DON'T. CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR. OF THE BOTS AS WELL OR HOW. ARE THE WEALTHIEST CORPORATIONS IN HISTORY THE WORLD ARE USING BOTS. BUT. IT'S CLOSE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE I GATHER INFORMATION PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION SO WE CAN CHOOSE NOT TO ADVANCE THE BILL. TODAY. AND I COULD GIVE THE CLOTHES FOR YOU KNOW MY OPPOSITION WHICH IS THAT THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE HERE AND YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE NOT. HARMING ANYBODY. WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF HOW THE SPOTS ARE BEING USED AND THAT'S THE GOAL OF THE BILL IS THE INTENT MOVING FORWARD IT'S GOOD TO KNOW AND IT'S VERY HELPFUL IT KNOWING THOUGH THAT THAT DISCLOSURE IS CAN. IS ONLY AS HELPFUL AS IT IS TRULY MEANINGFUL AND SO IF IF I'M GETTING A DISCLOSURE WHEN I GO TO A SITE IN A PRIVACY POLICY THAT SAYS THE CIDER THIS. WHATEVER USES BOTS. AB I THINK WAS UNIVERSALLY THE IMPRESSION OF MOST OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AS SOMETHING NEFARIOUS IS GOING ON AND IT'S JUST BEEN DISCLOSED TO ME WHEN. THAT MAY NOT ONLY NOT BE THE CASE BUT THAT MADE DISCOURAGE ME. AND US FROM HAVING THE TYPE OF TRADE AND COMMERCE WE WOULD WANT TO HAVE BUT I KNOW YOU'RE GOING YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT MORE MEANINGFUL IT'S IT'S AN INTERESTING POINT THAT YOU MAKE I THINK OF THE SAME ARGUMENT COULD HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT COOKIES AND TWENTY THIRTEEN. AND I I THINK THAT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW COOKIES ARE BEING USED OR ALSO HOW WE'LL TO. USE OR ALLOW ACCESS BY COOKIES NOW THAT WE HAVE IN AWARENESS ABOUT IT EMPOWERS CALIFORNIANS EMPOWERS INTERNET USERS AND THAT'S MY HOPE HERE AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR. QUESTION IS SEEING NONE OF LET ME ALSO I THINK YOU ARE. MISSILE LEAN FOR WORKING WITH OUR STAFF ARE AND GENERALLY SPEAKING I I DO NOT LIKE TO LENGTHEN PRIVACY POLICIES AND. IN FACT A FEW YEARS AGO I HAD A BILL TO SHORTEN A PRIVACY POLICIES. BUT IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THE BOXES ARE GENERATING SO MUCH ATTENTION AND IT'S A THE ISSUE OF ARE. OF VITAL IMPORTANCE I I THINK THAT. THAT COMPETITION IS TO GO ON AND ALSO ON WHO WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO. ALSO GO AFTER THOSE. QUESTIONABLE ACTIVITIES OTHER NEFARIOUS UNFIT TO RESULT THERE I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET OUT IN FACT SO. TIGHT DO WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO STEAL OUR MOVE ON IN THAT DIRECTION ALSO SO OUR WITHOUT IT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AND THAT I ACTUALLY WOULD NEED A MOTION FIRST. TRY HAVE A MOTION. IF YOU LIVE YOU KNOW AND IF CLOSER SIDE ANOTHER DAY I WILL WORK WITH YOU IN THE COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE WE GO AFTER. OTHER NEFARIOUS SPOTS THAT TAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL KNOWN WORKING WITH THAT COMMITTEES TO GET THERE. KNOW ME WAITING QUITE LAND ON GOING AFTER ONLY THE EVIL BOTS WHICH IS DISCLOSURE IN GENERAL ABOUT POTS TO RAISE AWARENESS IS MY HOPE THAT WE HAVE A MOTION. AND A SECOND IN THE VOTES TO CONTINUE WORK ON THIS ISSUE THAT CALIFORNIANS TO CARRY GREAT TILL ABOUT. ABSOLUTELY. VERY GOOD AND ONCE WE. AS A COURTESY I'M HAVING TO PROVIDE A MOTION BIG IT WE HAVE A MOTION TO HAVE A SECOND. WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO COME INTO A SECOND AMONG YOUR MOTION HOW THAT.

WERE FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL. I'VE BASICALLY FOR THE REASON THAT ALL THE THE EXISTING SAFEGUARDS CONTAINED IN THE BNP CODE OF FOR THESE PRODUCTS. MAKE SOME SORT OF A TENT TO EXPLAIN. THE EMPTY SPACE WITHIN THE BOX OF THE CONSUMER BUT ISN'T ISN'T BUYING. THE NEW SAFEGUARDS ARE BEING ADDED I'D DO NOTHING TO TO EXPLAIN THE EMPTY SPACE OF THERE IS IS SPACE IN THE BOX THEY ALLOW FOR THAT SPACE TO TO BE THERE AS LONG AS THEY DISCLOSE. AT THE CONSUMER THROUGH A SILHOUETTE OF A FELT LINED THAT YES INDEED THERE'S ANTI SPACE IN THIS BOX BUT. YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT BECAUSE WE TOLD YOU ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOX. THE FOR THESE REASONS YOU KNOW WE CLASSIFY THESE THESE NEW SAFEGUARDS MORE AS A. GOOD CONSUMER I'VE. AB B. SEED NOTE IT'S IT'S IT'S GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICE UP WE DON'T CONSIDER THEM SAFEGUARDS AND WOULD ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. ON THE NEXT PLACE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. SEEING NONE LET'S. COME BACK TO THE COMMUNITY QUESTIONS. COMMENTS. CNN ARM. CHRISTMAS ESSENTIAL WHICH YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT CONCERN JUST BRIEFLY OR THE A PROPONENT IS TO THE FORTY CLOSE. NO. WE CAN BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT. SPACES PRO AT A PREMIUM WHENEVER YOU GO TO A STORE WHENEVER YOU PACKAGE REMEMBER YOU SHIP WHENEVER YOU. BRING FORTH MERCHANDISE LIKE I COULD IMAGINE THAT THERE WOULD BE A MANUFACTURER OR A PACKAGING COMPANY THAT'S GOING TO SAY HEY LET'S GO CREE BIGGER BOXES BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO COST US MORE. AND THAT WE WE COULD DO OF THE CONSUMER. QUITE ON THE CONTRARY OTHER LEGITIMATE REASONS WHY A BOX IS A LITTLE BIT BIGGER THAN THE MITCHELL INSIDE A NUMBER ONE MATERIAL DOESN'T BREAK. LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE A YOUR CHEERIOS. NOW YOU DON'T WANT THEM SMASHED UP IMMEDIATELY AND ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GET A SMALL LITTLE PUSH ON IT. I MEAN IT'S SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A CUSHION THERE TOO OR IF YOU SAY YOU'RE BUYING FLOUR FOR EXAMPLE IT'S GONNA PACK ITSELF DOWN AFTER A LITTLE WHILE. SO YOU GET A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA SPACE THERE. IF SO I I EVEN LIKE THE ONE LIKE THE ECONOMIST ONE THAT'S. TO ME THAT LOOK PRETTY BASIC BECAUSE YOU CAN GET AN ACTUAL SIZE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUR. AT YOUR COMPUTER AND YOU WOULD PUT THE MANUFACTURER OR A. GLORIA STORY. ELIGIBLE FOR A MORE RELIABLE POTENTIALLY JUST BECAUSE YOU LOOK IT UP ON THE INTERNET IT DOESN'T SHOW YOU THE EXACT SIZE SUCH WHY WE PUT THAT IN THERE I THINK THESE ARE COMMON SENSE. APPROACHES BUT I WOULD FINISH OFF JUST BY SAYING I I DON'T KNOW OF ANYBODY WHO WOULD SAY LET'S GO SPEND MORE MONEY MAKE CREATE A BIGGER BOX. IN DEEP SOMEBODY. OKAY WITHOUT YOUR CLOTHES. VERY GOOD.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THIS IS ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY THREE WHICH WOULD EXPAND. EXISTING SAFETY PROTECTIONS IN FEDERAL AND STATE LAW TO APPLY TO RENTAL CAR COMPANIES REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE OF SAFETY RECALLS TO FOOD PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING PROGRAMS AS CURRENTLY DEFINED IN CALIFORNIA'S. INSURANCE COAT. I WILL BE ACCEPTING AUTHORS AMENDMENTS IS NOT IN THE CAMINO HOUSES ON PAGE SEVEN AND FORCE AND NOT ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE EIGHT AT SID TODAY WITH ME AS. PRESIDENT ASIA HAND OUT WITH CONSUMERS FOR AUTO RELIABILITY AND SAFETY IN AND YOU GO. WITH TECHNET. OUR FIRST WITNESS PLEASE GRANT MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I BIRDS VERY SHE HIM PRESIDENT CONSUMERS FOR AUTO RELIABILITY AND SAFETY AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOADS LEADERSHIP IN AUTHORING THIS BILL AND ALSO THE PORT FROM THE. VARIOUS ENTITIES WOULD BE REGULATED UNDER THIS WE FEEL A SENSE OF URGENCY TO GET THIS ENACTED BECAUSE THE EXISTING LAW HEARING CALIFORNIA DOESN'T FIT THEIR BUSINESS MODEL. AND WE WORKED WITH. KELLY HOW KUSA MOTHER VERY CHILLING JACQUELYN HOW OAK WHO WERE KILLED BY A RECALL THE RENTAL CAR ON THEIR WAY HOME FROM. OR HIGH BACK TO SANTA CRUZ. AND IN GETTING ENACTED FEDERAL LEGISLATION SPONSORED BY SENATOR SCHUMER AND CO SPONSORED BY SENATOR BOXER AND SENATOR FEINSTEIN. AND OTHER SENATORS. THAT. YOU BOTH RENTAL CAR COMPANIES WITH FLEETS OF THIRTY FIVE OR MORE VEHICLES FROM RENTING LOANING OR SELLING THEM. TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS THEY HAVE A SAFETY RECALL THERE'S BEEN PERFORMED. AND WE APPRECIATE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GORDON AUTHORED A SIMILAR BILL IN CALIFORNIA THAT. ADDRESSES THOSE WHO POLL REGARDING RENTAL CAR COMPANIES THAT HAVE FEWER FIELD GOALS IN THEIR RENTAL CAR FLEETS. BUT THE MODEL IN THAT EXISTING LAW DOESN'T REALLY FIT THE THE BUSINESS MODEL THAT. THEIR PEER TO PEER RIDESHARING COMPANIES HAVE. AND IT ASSUMES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET NOTICES THE MANUFACTURES RECALL BUT. UNDER FEDERAL LAW THE NOTICE GOES TO THE OWNER OF THE VEHICLE THEY'RE NOT THE OWNER. SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET THAT RECALL NOTICE. IT ALLOWS THE EXISTING LONG CALIFORNIA ALLOWS THEM FORTY EIGHT HOURS. AFTER THEY RECEIVE THE NOTICE TO. REMOVE THE VEHICLE FROM STEPPING IN SERVICE. IT DOESN'T. AGAIN IT DOESN'T FIT THEIR BUSINESS MODEL AND ALLOWS FOR AN INTERIM REPAIR BUT THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO OVERSEE THAT REAP YOUR. AND WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW'S BILL WOULD DO IS REQUIRE ACTUALLY A HIGHER STANDARD AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO SUPPORT THAT A HIGHER STANDARD THAT SAYS. IF IT'S UNDER SAFETY RECALL. THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING IT. AND GETTING IT OFF THE PLATFORM. AND WE HAVE NATIONWIDE ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN MILLION CARS THAT HAVE OPEN SAFETY RECALLS THE MANUFACTURES ARE DOING THINGS LIKE GOING ON FACEBOOK AND GOING DOOR TO DOOR AND MAYORS OF CITIES IN CALIFORNIA DOING OUTREACH IN THE POLICE ARE DOING HOURS. TRYING TO GET THESE CARS FIXED WE SEE THIS BILL AS SOMETHING THAT WILL SAVE LIVES. WE HOPE SOONER BIG BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT TIME. AB IF WE CAN PREVENT MORE FATALITIES AND INJURIES. EVER EVERYONE BENEFITS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WHEN HIS PLACE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ARE UNABLE REPRESENTING TORO THE TRAGEDY THAT MS SHEA HAND DESCRIBED. LED TO THE RENTAL CAR INDUSTRY GOING OUT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ASKING FOR AN EXPLICIT EXEMPTION FROM VICARIOUS LIABILITY WHICH THEY ACTUALLY ACHIEVED. BUT YOU IN CALIFORNIA PASSED A LAW IN TWENTY TEN THAT EXPLICITLY HOLDS. OUT SHARON COMPANIES LIKE THIS. ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE FULL LIABILITY OF OWNERSHIP AND YOU ALSO PASSED A LAW THAT REQUIRES US TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM LEVEL OF INSURANCE. FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS WE DO NOT WANT ANYTHING IN THIS BILL WE ARE HOPING THAT COMMITTEE WILL MAKE THIS DECISION. THAT WOULD LANDED A A FUTURE LEGISLATURE TO REDEFINE US AS RENTAL CAR COMPANIES IT WOULD LOWER THE STANDARD OF LIABILITY. IT WOULD LOWER THE STANDARD FOR INSURANCE IN THE WHOLE REASON WE'RE COMING HERE TODAY TO BACK OUR CONSUMER ALLIES. ON THIS BILL AND ASK FOR YET ANOTHER OBLIGATION ON A HOUSE THAT RENTAL CAR AGENCIES DON'T HAVE UNDER CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW. IS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT. ARE ANYTHING TO HAPPEN TO OUR CUSTOMERS THAT HAPPENED TO THERE'S IN THAT INCIDENT THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. PLEASE COME FORWARD YA ALL BALTIC THE FIRST I'M THIS IS ANDREA ABOUT IT SIR I'M VICE PRESIDENT FOR TECHNET I WILL KEEP MY REMARKS BRIEF. AS YOU KNOW WE REPRESENT OVER EIGHTY COMPANIES IN THE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION SPACE IT IS NOT OFTEN THAT TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ASKED TO BE REGULATED BUT IS THAT IS WHAT WE'RE HERE TODAY TO DO ALL AYE. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE HAVE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU.

KEVIN KILLINGS INTERNET ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT PLACE. MARGARET BLOODSTAIN NOW HAVE GLOBAL MODEL MAKERS ALSO SUPPORT THANK YOU MUCH. NEXT PLEASE. CNN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. IT'S A HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AIRPORTS COUNCIL REPRESENTING THIRTY ONE COMMERCIAL AIRPORTS IN THE STATE. WE'RE NOW NEUTRAL ON THE BILL HOWEVER WE WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE TO ADOPT ALL. OF THE ANALYSIS IS. SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS WE THINK THAT WILL STRENGTHEN. THE BILL THANK YOU. YOU NEXT CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS VERY BROAD ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS. WE REPRESENT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF. PEOPLE IN THIS INDUSTRY. HAVE I NEED TO CLARIFY A COUPLE OF THINGS WE WERE TOLD JUST BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. THAT THE AUTHOR WAS ACCEPTING A DIFFERENT AMENDMENT THEN. HE JUST ACCEPTED. SO. I AS I UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE ACCEPTED WE WOULD REMAIN IN OPPOSITION WHAT I WAS TOLD HE WAS ACCEPTING WOULD HAVE REMOVED OUR OPPOSITION. SO SUDDEN SHIFTED HERE SO I'M GONNA ASSUME THAT WE OPPOSE THIS BILL AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHY. FIRST OF ALL TORO WAS A RENTAL CAR COMPANY UNTIL SIX MONTHS AGO. THEY HAD AN OPERATION IT SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT THEY DECLARED THEMSELVES NOT TO BE A RENTAL CAR COMPANY BECAUSE THEY RENT THEIR CARS ON AN APP. AND STOP FOLLOWING ALL THE RULES INCLUDING ALL THE SAFETY RULES RELATED TO. RENTAL CAR COMPANIES AND ALL THE CONSUMER RULES AND THERE'S MORE TO CONSUMERS THAN CONSUMER RULES AND SAFETY. VAN RECALL ISSUES IF THEY ARE RENTAL COMPANY THEY'RE COVERED BY RECALL BUT THEY ALSO CAN'T RIP PEOPLE LOCKS. THEY ALSO CAN'T THEY ALSO HAVE TO MAINTAIN THEIR VEHICLES IN GOOD WORKING ORDER. THERE IS ALSO A LOT OF THINGS THAT THOUGHT OF ACCIDENTS GET HAPPEN BECAUSE CARS ARE NOT MAINTAINED APPROPRIATELY WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SAFETY RECALLS. SAFETY RECALL SHOULD BE COVERED BUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE AND WHAT WAS THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS IS JUST THE NEXT. ONE OF THESE THINGS WHERE SOMEBODY CREATES AN APP AND SAYS THERE ARE BASICALLY A DEREGULATED BUSINESS SO WHEN THEY COME HERE SAYING THEY'RE ASKING TO BE REGULATED. THEY'RE ASKING TO BE DEREGULATED. EXCEPT FOR ONE THING. AND THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE AND THAT'S WHAT YOU VOTING FOR. NOW. THIS SANTA SCHOOL AIRPORT HAS LITIGATION AGAINST THEM SAYING YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE YOU CHANGE YOUR NAME AND STOP FOLLOWING ALL THE RULES DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE NOT A RENTAL CAR COMPANY. AND THEY SAID WELL WE'RE ONE OF THESE PERSONAL SHARING PLATFORMS AND LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THESE PERSONAL SHARING PLATFORMS AND WHY THEY ARE NOT ONE OF THOSE. YOU CANNOT MAKE A PROFIT. YOU CANNOT HAVE ANY VEHICLE IN COMMERCIAL SERVICE. AND WORSE THAN THAT. THAT EVEN THIS PROVISION. IN THAT INSURANCE CODE PROVISION THAT SAYS AND I JUST WANT TO READ THIS TO YOU THE PRIMARY AND EXCESS INSURER OR INSURERS AND THE OWNERS OPERATORS AND MAINTAINERS OF THE PRIVATE PASSENGER MOTOR VEHICLE. USED IN A PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING PROGRAM SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO NOTIFY AND ENSURED THAT IT HAS NO DUTY TO DEFEND OR INDEMNIFY ANY PERSON ORGANIZATION FOR LIABILITY. FOR ANY LOSS THAT OCCURS DURING THE USE OF THE VEHICLE IN A PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING PROGRAM SO THE PERSON WHO RENTS THE CAR. AS OPPOSED TO THE PERSON WHO OWNS THE CAR DOESN'T HAVE COVERAGE. SO THIS IS NOT A GOOD BILL FOR CONSUMERS LASTLY. IF YOU LOOK AT TOROS WEBSITE IT TALKS ABOUT RENTING A CAR IF YOU WILL IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE HOW THEY'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT PEOPLE IT SAYS MAKE MONEY OFF YOUR CAR. SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY A FOR PROFIT RENTAL CAR BUSINESS. BUT WHAT IS MORE PERNICIOUS ABOUT IT. AND WHAT THE AUTO MANUFACTURERS NO AND YOU NEED TO NOW. ISN'T THIS IS JUST THE NEXT SUB PRIME LENDING DEAL IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT. GET YOURSELF INTO A CAR THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD. AND WE ALL AND THAT'S WHY THE AUTO COMPANIES ARE INVESTING DIRECTLY IN THE SKY IN THE EAST COMPANIES. PUT YOURSELF INTO A CAR THAT YOU CAN AFFORD AND HELP YOURSELF PAY THE LOAN THAT YOU WOULDN'T OTHERWISE QUALIFIED FOR. FOR BEING IN THE HOUSE. TAKE A LOOK AT IT TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR WEBSITE SEE HOW THEY ARE ARE CLAIMING TO ATTRACT PEOPLE. IT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM AND YOU'RE GONNA SEE IT HERE SOME DAY IF THIS THING. TAKES OFF AND IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE CONSUMER RULES OF THE RENTAL CAR INDUSTRY FINE TO HAVE IT. BUT THIS IS THE RENTAL CAR BUSINESS AND ALL THE RENTAL CAR COMPANY SHOULD BE UNDER THE SAME SET OF CONSUMER RULES THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT'S REALLY FAIR AND EQUITABLE. SO AS IT STANDS NOW WE OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. WHEN YOU LABOR FEDERATION. AND SURE MISTER BROUGHT WHICH YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO STAY JUST IN CASE THERE'S QUESTIONS LATER ON EXISTS. IN THE FRONT ROW IF YOU WANT. HE GLANCED AREA BUSINESS YEAR MEMBER SARAH FLOCKS IN THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE ARE ALSO IN OPPOSITION I'M TO THIS BILL GIVEN THAT THE AUTHOR DID NOT TAKE THE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS. WE DO ALIGNED HERSELF WITH MR BROADS COMMENTS AND THINK THAT PERSONAL VEHICLE I'M SHARING PROGRAMS SHOULD HAVE THE SAME CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND LEVEL OF COMPETITION AS RENTAL CAR COMPANIES THANK YOU. THANK IMAGE NEXT PLEASE. JOHN ROSS TO THE HERTZ CORPORATION OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE. SEEING NONE LET'S SO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISTER MONNING GO AHEAD. THEY'VE IS SURE THANK YOU MISTER LOWE SO THAT MISTER BROADER FOR DO SOME DISCREPANCIES OVER AMENDMENTS AGREED TO WERE NOT AGREED TO. CAN YOU ARTICULATE FOR ME SORT OF WHAT THAT DIFFERENCE IS I UNDERSTAND THERE WERE CONVERSATIONS. YOU KNOW RIGHT UP TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY I'M I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND MOVE IT FOR BUT CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR ME. WHAT THAT OUTSTANDING ISSUE IS AND WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON? I THINK YOU VERY MUCH AYE SOME OR MULLIN. AS. YOU MAY HAVE SEEN COMING OUT OF THAT THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WE DID WANT TO INITIALLY HAVE. A CONVERSATIONS WITH RESPECT TO RENTAL CAR COMPANIES AND THAT OF. THESE A PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING PROGRAMS ABOUT FROM TO DO SHARE COMMITTEE NOW WHEAT IS SITTING SIGNIFICANTLY. NARROWED AND TAILOR THE BILL BEFORE US HERE TODAY IS JUST SIMPLY RISK WITH RESPECT TO. THE SUBJECT OF MANUFACTURERS RECALL FOR THESE PERSONAL SHARING VEHICLE PROGRAMS A SO WHAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU HERE TODAY IS JUST SIMPLY REQUIRING. A SUCH APPLICATIONS TO ALSO BE SUBJECTED TO THAT MANUFACTURES RECALLS FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION. OF THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US HERE TODAY. WITH RESPECT TO. THE LANGUAGE HERE. AS. THE COMMITTEE AS AS PRESENTED IN COMMITTEE IF I MIGHT VIA THE CHAIR. JEFF YET OF THE THE INTERPRETATION IS CLASSIFYING THAT OF DEFINING THIS AS OF RENTAL CAR COMPANIES AND THAT'S NOT THE DIRECTION THAT WE. ARE GOING IN AT PRESENT HERE BECAUSE OF WHAT THE DISCUSSION AND DIALOGUE. DID HAPPENED OUT OF JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO ADMIT YOUR SECURITY WE DID WANT TO GET INTO THAT BUT FROM JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IT IS BEEN NARROWLY TAILORED JUST TO. THE RECALL MANUFACTURES RECON REQUIRING THAT OF OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION BEING APPLIED SIMPLY TO. SUCH AN APPLICATION. MISTER CALDERON GO AHEAD. YOU'RE RIGHT. THERE'S THE RECALL YOU KNOW I EITHER THEY'RE DIFFERENT RIDE SHARING COMPANIES IS THE PART OF THIS BILL THAT DEALS WITH RECALL OTHER PART IS THIS QUESTION OF RENT A CAR COMPANY WHAT IT. AND THIS IS REALLY THINK THIS BILL IS TO ADDRESSING WHAT AND RENTAL CAR COMPANY IS OR ISN'T I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO. TO FOCUS ON IS IS SPECIFIC TO ANY VEHICLES ARE OPERATING SPECIFICALLY I TO WRITE A PROGRAM WITH A SUPER LIFTER WHATEVER THAT IF THERE IS A RECALL ON THAT SPECIFIC. VEHICLE THAT IS IN USE THAT THAT CAR SHOULD NOT BE ON THE ROAD PARTICIPATING IN THAT. IN THAT ACTUAL PROGRAM OF RIDE SHARING. INABILITY. ART HARRIS AND GET TOGETHER. IF YOU HAVE A. BUT. BUT YOU KNOW I I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY MISTER BROAD NOW WHEN IT COMES TO OTHER COMPANIES WHETHER THERE'S TORO. AND WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE OPERATING AS A RENTAL CAR COMPANY OR NOT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO. LOOK LOOK INTO. I JUST DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THIS BILL OR NOT BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT MAY BE BEGIN HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE. THAT EFFORT TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE WHETHER IT'S IN THIS BILL OR SOMETHING ELSE BUT I HAPPY A BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO BE PART THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT. THE OPPOSITION HAS BROUGHT UP THAT YOU KNOW WE DO NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO US LEGISLATURE AND TERMS OF WHAT IS DEFINED AS WHAT. AND WHAT SHOULD APPLY TO THIS WHICH SHOULD NOT APPLY TO THIS. MAY I RESPOND MISTER ABSOLUTELY YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT YOU VERY MUCH SOME OCCULT WHEN WE INITIALLY HAD A CONVERSATION WITH RENTAL CAR COMPANIES AND THAT OF. THIS. INNOVATION ECONOMY WITH RESPECT AS A SOMEONE FRIEDMAN. A SUBSEQUENT AGAIN TO THAT OF JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WE DID ADDRESS MANY OF THOSE DIFFERENT ISSUES. BUT WHAT WE HAVE HERE TODAY IS JUST VERY NARROW IN SCOPE AND JUST CONSUMER PROTECTIONS PROVIDED HIM COMPETE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AN EQUALLY COMMITTED. TO YOU AND TO EVERYONE FORCE COMMITTEE AND HAVING FOR THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE FRAMEWORK. OF OUR ON THESE ISSUES AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW I ENGAGED IN MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH RESPECT TO TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES AND THEN GUN FIGHTS WITH TAXICABS AND THEN DID TAXICABS LEGISLATION AND SO. AT THIS IS PERFECTLY THE PURVIEW BUT AGAIN BEFORE US HERE TODAY THAT WE ARE NOT IN THAT DISCUSSION WE'RE SIMPLY DISCUSSING CONSUMER PROTECTION AND REQUIRING THAT. OF THE MANUFACTURES RECALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE. JUST TO OF FOR CLARIFICATION PURPOSES I I KNOW THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION A A AS TO WHAT AMENDMENT AND. WAS ACCEPTED A WHAT TIME IT WAS NOT ACCEPTED I THINK THE AUTHOR I MADE REFERENCE TO PAGES SEVEN AND EIGHT ARE. I THINK HE SAID THAT HE. WOULD ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS TO THE STATE OWNS PAGE SEVEN IN PAY SEVEN WHICH SAYS THAT THE CHANGES TO THE SECTION MADE BY DE ACT. ADDING SO THE REGENCY SHOW NOT APPLY IN ANY MANNER TO PENDING LITIGATION THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE THERE IS A PENDING LET. OUR LITIGATION IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THE GOAL OF ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES FULL OF OF FOR THE FOR THE COMMITTEE WAS. ESSENTIALLY TO ARM PUT LANGUAGE INTO THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF THE LEGISLATION. ARE EITHER PRESIDENT OR AND INTO THE FUTURE SAYS THAT'S THE REASON WHY THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED A COUPLE OF THEIR MEMBERS IN WHICH US. DE WAS WHAT I JUST READ WAS SO HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE AUTHOR I. DE A THE OTHER PROVISION WAS NOT ACCEPTED BY BY THE AUTHOR OF THAT PROVISION SAYS THAT NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL PREVENT A PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARE SHARING PROGRAM FROM BEING DEEMED A RENTAL COMPANY OR RENTAL CAR COMPANY. PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER SECTION AND DOT IS THE PROVISION THAT THE AUTHOR OF IT IS NOT ACCEPTING TODAY ARE JUST FOR THE RECORD AND THE SUBSEQUENT TO THAT THOUGH. DE COMMITTEE DID OFFER A YOU KNOW OTHER LANGUAGE TO THE AUTHOR OF WHO HAS NOT THE WHO HAS CHOSEN NOT TO ACCEPT IT DOWN. SO THAT SO THAT SO WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING FILE FOOTAGE TO FOR THE RECORD. MISTRESS DM QUESTION. YES. IN IN THE THE ANALYSIS THE ONE SECTION THEM THAT IS NOT BE I WANT TO JUST CONFIRM. IS THE SENTENCE IT READS NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL PREVENT. A PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING PROGRAM FROM BEING DEEMED A RENTAL COMPANY A RENTAL CAR COMPANY PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER SECTION. IS THAT THE PART THAT IS NOT BEING ACCEPTED. AS AMENDED. DOES AMENDMENT. TO SOMEONE WHEN YOU'RE REFERRING TO PAGE EIGHT IS THAT CORRECT. THE REGISTER YES THAT'S CORRECT. IT IT A. M.. RIGHT IT WILL BE HAVE HERE BEFORE US IS THE SIMPLY THE MANUFACTURERS RECALL. AND AS WE DISCUSSED IN JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WE DO NOT WANT TO GET INTO THIS DISCUSSION OF THAT THE DEFINITION AS. SOME ARE CALLING ON PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED ABOUT A WIDER CONVERSATION OR SIMPLY SAYING HERE IS THAT NUMBER ONE AS WE SAID IN JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND RESTATE HERE AGAIN. THAT WE WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS WOULD NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON ANY PENDING LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO THE SITTING COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. ON THIS AND THE DEFINITIONS OF THIS AND SO THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO BE VERY. NARROW IN WHAT THIS BILL WILL D AND AGAIN SUBJECT. OF TIPS TO MANUFACTURE RECALL AND NOT GET INTO THAT DISCUSSION BUT AGAIN CLARIFYING THAT NOTHING IN THIS BILL WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE PENDING LITIGATION BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO GET. INTO THAT. BECAUSE IT MIGHT RECOGNIZE THAT. YOU WERE TRYING NOT TO SAY WHETHER TO RENTAL OR NOT. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. BUT I WENT ONLINE YESTERDAY. AND ON TRUE. SAYS. RENT BETTER CARS TRUE CAR RENTAL MARKETPLACE THAT TODAY WHEN I LOOKED AT IT. IT SAYS RENT BETTER CARS BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT WEBSITE. BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THAT DOES GO TO THE VERY HEART OF THE LITIGATION. IN SAN FRANCISCO. ARE YOU WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION FROM LANGUAGE TO ACCEPT. OUR IS IT THE LANGUAGE OR IS IT THE ENTIRE CONCEPT THAT YOU DON'T WANT THAT PARTICULAR SENTENCE IN. SOMEONE AYE OF. BEEN ENGAGING CONVERSATION SINCE THE INCEPTION ABOUT THIS AS A YOU KNOW AGAIN MAY RECALL THERE ARE NUMBER OF AUTHOR AT MYSELF IN SOMEONE FRIEDMAN WITH PROSPECTIVE RENTAL CARS AND WE. CAME UP WITH A FRAMEWORK FROM ACQUIRING SIMILAR CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FEES ALL OF THE ASSOCIATED ISSUE SIMILARLY. BUT OUT OF JUDICIARY GIVEN. THE THE CHAIRPERSON AT THAT TIME I IT WAS THE DESIRE TO BE VERY NARROW IN SCOPE. AT THE SAME TIME HAVE BUYING TIME TO HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION ON A DEFINITION SO IT WOULD BE MY COMMITMENTS AS I MENTIONED IN THE JUDICIARY TO WHICH YOU WERE PRESENT. TO CONTINUE IN THOSE CONVERT FRUITFUL CONVERSATIONS BEGAN HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE UNDER CONSUMER PROTECTION OF PRIVACY OUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A VERY NARROW ISSUE WHICH IS THAT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION. I SHOULD THE SLEEVE COMMITTEE I KNOW THAT THIS WILL BE A CONVERSATION AND SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WITHIN THAT AREA OF JURISDICTION TO DISCUSS LEGALITIES BUT AGAIN. I JUST WANTED TO URGED THE FOCUSED POINT WHICH IS THAT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION BUT AGAIN EQUALLY COMMITTED TO HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS MISTER TANK I. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MR LOW. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT CONSUMER PROTECTION. PORTIONS OF THE BILL I THINK THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY. AT NECESSARY I BY TACKLED MY CONCERNS WITH THIS REYES AYE I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS. THAT WERE TAKEN OUT TO. NOT IN ANYWAYS INFLUENCE THE LITIGATION I DO DO HAVE A CONCERN WITH MY OTHER COUNTY HAD THE SAN MATEO COUNTY HAVE DUBBED THE THREE OF US SHARE. IS THAT THEY ARE THE VOTERS. DECIDED TO RAISE TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS THROUGH OF SLIGHTLY MORE UNIQUE WAY BECAUSE OF SAN FRANCISCO NATIONAL BUT THROUGH RENTAL CAR COMPANY FEES AND THAT WAS ON A MAJOR. HOME MAJOR VOTE OF THE PEOPLE TO RAISE MONEY FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN SAN MATEO. SO. MY CONCERN WITH THIS THIS COMPANY PARTICULAR IN THIS SPECIFIC INSTANCE IS THEY'RE THEY'RE ACTING LIKE A RENTAL CAR COMPANY BUT YET THEY'RE NOT PAYING. THE SAME FEES AND THEY'RE NOT CRITICAL FEES THAT THE VOTERS HAVE DECIDED TO RELY ON FOR. PUBLIC TRANSIT IN THE COUNTY THAT THERE. SKINNER STARTED OPERATION SO I GUESS THE CONCERN IS. GIVEN HOW THE LEGISLATION IS WRITTEN TO SEE TO MAKE IT DEMARCATION OF RENTAL CAR COMPANY VERSUS PERSONAL VEHICLE. SHARING ON. IT AND I KNOW YOU WANNA OPERABLE PUTTING THE WHOLE DISCUSSION ON FEES TOLL LATER IT DOES GIVE ME CONCERN AT THIS JUNCTURE AROUND. HOW THIS WOULD IMPACT YOSEMITE OR COUNTY HARD IMPACTS THE REVENUE COLLECTION AROUND PUBLIC TRANSIT KILLED THAT THE VOTERS ARE PRE CLEARED THEIR NUMBER OF OTHER? FEES THAT WERE DEBATED TO GO GET PUBLIC TRANSIT DOLLARS BUT THIS IS THE ONE THAT WAS REALLY DETERMINED. YES IF I DON'T MAYOR ABSENT GUY THINGS VERY MUCH IS EMERGING AS I STATED EARLIER THIS WAS DOUBLE OVER FOR ABOUT JUDICIARY. MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU HAVE ADDRESSED. WE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN STAKEHOLDER CONVERSATIONS TO FIND PARITY AND MANY OF AND FRANKLY THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENT. BUT BECAUSE OF THE DIRECTION OF THE A COMMITTEE. HOW COMING HERE? THE IT WAS THE PRODUCT OF OF THE COMMITTEE AND I ACCEPTED IT TO NOT GET INTO THAT DISCUSSION. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON THAT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. AND THEREFORE IN ORDER TO GET THIS BILL TO MOVE FORWARD WITH GREAT MARY LEE TAYLOR JUST SIMPLY THE CONSUMER PROTECTION BUT AGAIN. TO ADDRESSING MANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY RAISED AB WE WERE ENGAGED IN THIS CONVERSATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS PARITY AND SIMILARLY ON. OF SOME OF THE MINUTES POLITIES OF LOCAL ENTITIES AND ENGAGING AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A SENSE OF OF. OWNERSHIP AND A COMMITMENT TO SOME OF THE SAME TYPE OF FEES AND REGULATIONS IN WHICH IT AT THAT THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT I THINK. I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S SOME CONCERN FROM. YEAH YOU KNOW WITHOUT. I THINK THERE'S SOME CONCERN THAT. MAYBE THAT THIS BILL BECOMES SOMETHING ELSE IN THE SENATE. I PILED REALLY POP NOT THE CASE BECAUSE I WOULD WANT TO LET. THAT DON'T SUPPORT THE BILL AND THEN IT BECOMES. THIS SEMESTERS AGO AGREEMENT OF COURSE THAT'S OKAY. AT HOME BUT. ALSO THE CONCERN THAT I THINK IS THIS. DOES NEED TO GET RESOLVED SOONER RATHER THAN LATER BECAUSE IT IS AGAIN FAIRLY. CRITICAL ISSUE ON CAPITOL AND YOU KNOW AT OUR LOCAL AIRPORT. AT OUR LOCAL AIRPORT THE FOUR OF US ON AUG GO TO THEIR PART OF IT. AND I THINK IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT ADOPTED COME BURKE RESOLVED. OKAY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR COME QUESTIONS. BUT MR MELINDA HAD. JUST IN IN LIGHT OF. IN LIGHT OF MR THINGS COMMENTS. I TOO WOULD LIKE SOME ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS ON THE REVENUE IMPACTS INSANITY OF COUNTY WHICH HOUSES. SFO. AND AND THE SFO IMPACTS GENERALLY SO ALL OF THE SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. I HAVE NOT PERSONALLY HEARD OUT FROM MY COUNTY. WITH CONCERNS ABOUT REVENUE AND AS THIS NEW MODEL GROWS AND WHAT THAT IMPACT MIGHT BE. AYE AT SFO BUT I WILL BE LOOKING FOR SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. IN THAT REGARD AND I EXPECT A AFTER THE HEARING TODAY YOU HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS. A WITH THE UPON AND SO ON. I BELIEVE WE HAVE MOVED IN SECOND BILL THAT I WAS SUPPORTING IT TODAY BUT I LOOK FOR SOME ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION. AND FUTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT. THE ORIGINAL ON THE RECOMMENDATION WAS AYE WITH THE A MENSA IN BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT. THE AUTHOR HAS ACCEPTED ONE OF THE TWO ON SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS. DOT RECOMMENDATION BECOMES A NON RECOMMENDATION UNJUSTLY RECORD AND AND IF IN YOUR CLOSING. MR LOW IF YOU COULD ALSO ADDRESS THE THE THE REASON WHY THE LATEST SET OF AMENDMENT. WAS NOT WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE. IF YOU SO DESIRE AND JUST LET ME READ FOR THE RECORD OF THE LAST SET OF AMENDMENTS HAS DONE NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL PREVENT A PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING PROGRAM FROM BEING. DEEMED ANY OTHER THE ANY OTHER LEGAL ENTITY PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER SECTION OF THE LAW. ON THAT SIDE OF THE AMENDMENTS EARLY ON THAT DOES NOT MAKE MENTION OF THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW THIS AND MENTION THE FACT RENTAL. SO I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS AS TO WHY YOU KNOW THAT WAS NICE OF ACCEPTABLE TO GO WITH THAT DOUBT YOU KNOW YOU FEEL FREE TO CLOSE IF YOU WANT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THE ACCOMMODATIONS IN THE NON RECOMMENDATION. YES. OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE YOU PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO IN MY INTERPRETATION IS IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH GETTING THE PENDING LAWSUIT WE DON'T GET WANT TO GET IN FRONT OF THAT. AND WE DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THAT DISCUSSION. THIS IS WHITE BEFORE OF PRIVACY THAT AS I MENTIONED TO YOU EARLIER I WAS VERY MUCH WILLING TO ENGAGE IN THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SOME OF THESE AREAS OF ISSUES OF CONCERN. BUT BECAUSE THIS WAS DOUBLE REFERRED. AYE TO JUST HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH FORD IT IS BEFORE US HERE TODAY. AND SO I'M EQUALLY COMMITTED TO THOSE ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW TO ENGAGE IN LOOK AT LOCALITIES AND WHAT THAT IN THE END TAX MIGHT BE. OF BUT AGAIN SPECIFICALLY BEFORE US. IT IF WE WERE TO VOTE NO AND DO NOTHING SAYS CO EXIST THESE THIS COMPANIES TO OPERATE. ACCORDING TO THE DO NOTHING BUT IF WE VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS THEN WE WILL REQUIRE THEM TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE THE SAME. MANUFACTURES RECALL. SO THAT IS VERY NARROWLY TAILORED TO WHAT WE'RE HAVING CONCEPTS WITH BUT AGAIN I AND II BELIEVE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF IN THIS COMMITTEE TO. HAVE FURTHER HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE ENTIRE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. WITH RESPECT TO THIS AREA AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL. SHALL I I I I KILEY. ALRIGHT. BAKER. I BERMAN. AYE CALDERON. I. IRWIN. AYE MULLIN. AYE OBERNOLTE. I REYES. NOT VOTING. TEN. FIGURE EIGHT THOSE. THE BILL'S OUT CONGRATULATIONS. THE MAN ANSWERED. THE BILL. NO LEGAL BEFORE I PRESENT MY BILLS. LET'S. TAKE CARE OF WHO WON ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUE JUST A MINUTE YEAH DEFINITIONS. YOU. CAN SEE. I COULD. YEAH. WADE. WELL. SHARE A. SHE. YEAH. WE NEED SIX. OKAY. WELL I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT WE ASK THAT. YEAH. YEAH OKAY HONESTY THAT. MEANWHILE ANYTHING BECAUSE. ARE I'M GONNA PRESENT MY TWO BILLS I'M GONNA HAND ON THE GALLERY TO VICE CHAIR. KILEY SO THAT I COULD DO THAT. MR SHALL BE PRESENTING. FILE ITEM FOR THAT IS AB TWENTY FIVE ELEVEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. TODAY I PRESENT TO YOU AB TWENTY FIVE ELEVEN. LET ME START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS SELES IT ON PAGES SEVEN AND TEN OF THE ANALYSIS. DE AMENDMENTS ARE PROHIBITS SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES FROM SELLING AND MINERS INFORMATION WITHOUT ACTUAL PARENTAL CONSENT. AND REQUIRE ONLINE RETAILERS TO TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO VERIFY THE AGE OF THE PURCHASE. THE BILL AB TWENTY FIVE ELEVEN ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF WHETHER IT SHOULD BE LEGAL FOR INTERNET COMPANIES TO OBTAIN PARENTAL CONSENT. IN BOILERPLATE TERMS AND CONDITIONS WRITTEN IN LANGUAGE THAT CHILDREN MAY NOT UNDERSTAND. IF A CHILD WALKS INTO BRICK AND MORTAR STORE IN ATTEMPTS TO BUY ALCOHOL* A WEAPONS. STORE WERE CHECK THEIR IDENTIFICATION. IF A CHILD REFUSES TO OFFER PROOF OF AGE. STORE WOULD DECLINE TO SELL THE PRODUCT. THIS IS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA LAW PROHIBITS THE SALE OF SUCH DANGEROUS ITEMS TO CHILDREN. THESE ITEMS INCLUDE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES FIREARMS ARE HANDGUNS AMMUNITION OR RELOADED AMMUNITION. AND AEROSOL CONTAINER OF PAINT THAT IS CAPABLE OF DEFACING PROPERTY. ETCHING CREEN THAT IS CAPABLE OF DEFACING PROPERTY. ANY TOBACCO FOR CIGARETTE OR CIGARETTE PAPERS BLUNT WRAPS OR ANY OF THE PREPARATION PREPARATION OF TOBACCO ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES AND OBSCENE MATTERS. MANY ONLINE RETAILERS FINE PRINT FINE PRINT BOILERPLATE TERMS AND CONDITIONS MAKE NO EFFORT WHATSOEVER COMPARABLE TO THEIR BRICK AND MORTAR COMPETITORS TO OBTAIN AGE VERIFICATION. OR PARENTAL CONSENT TO PREVENT CHILDREN FROM PURCHASING ILLEGAL FIREARMS. THE ONLY A FOR ONE COMPANY MAKES IS TO INSERT THIS LANGUAGE IN ITS FINE PRINT BOILERPLATE TERMS AND CONDITION AS FOLLOWS. IF YOU ARE UNDER EIGHTEEN YOU MAY USE THE SERVICES ONLY WITH THE INVOLVEMENT OF A PARENT OR GUARDIAN. THE DANGERS OF INTERNET COMPANIES DOING NOTHING TO VERIFY EACH OR OBTAIN PARENTAL CONSENT. FOR THE KINDS OF TRANSACTION COVERED BY THIS BILL. HOW VERY REAL A RECENT CASE YOU ARE A NEWS STORY DETAILED HOW A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY? WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE ONLINE A BB GUN THROWING KNIVES AND HUNTING KNIFE ALL WITHOUT HIS PARENTS CONSENT OR KNOWLEDGE. AND HE WOULD LOOK OVER HERE. DOES. THAT'S A PICTURE OF THE GUY AND THAT WAS PURCHASE AND A REAL GUN. YOU COULD SEE THE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE TWO. AND THIS SITUATION A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD WAS ABLE TO BUY THESE ITEMS. BECAUSE THERE WAS NO CHECK. I SEE OF THE PURCHASER WAS OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. NOW SOME SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES OPERATE ALMOST IDENTICALLY WHEN IT COMES TO PARENTAL PERMISSION FOR BEING. ALLOWED TO SELL THE USE OF A CHILD'S NAME AND LIKENESS. TO A THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS. THE WAY ONE COMPANY SUPPOSEDLY OBTAINS PARENTAL PERMISSION FOR USING CHILDREN IN SUCH A MANNER. IS THROUGH THIS LANGUAGE INSERT INSERTED IN THIS BOILERPLATE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN YOU REPRESENT THAT A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN ALSO AGREES TO THIS ON YOUR BEHALF. THIS BILL AB TWENTY FIVE ELEVEN ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE IN A FEW WAYS FIRST IT WILL PROHIBITS SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES FROM SELLING. A MINOR'S INFORMATION WITHOUT ACTUAL PARENTAL CONSENT. IT REQUIRES THAT THE CONSENT BE SEPARATE FROM THE SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITE OR. IT'S A GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITION. IT PROHIBITS PARENTAL CONSENT FROM BEING OBTAINED THROUGH THE MINOR AND PROHIBIT A SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITE. ARE FROM DENYING A MINORS ACCESS TO THE PLATFORM THE FOR FAILURE. OF THE PARENTAL CONSENT. AB TWENTY FIVE ELEVEN FURTHER REQUIRES ONLINE RETAILERS TO TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO VERIFY THE H. OF THE PURCHASER FOR PRODUCTS ILLEGAL TO SELL TO A MINOR. AND TWO ADDITIONALLY PROHIBIT DELIVERY OF THOSE GOODS TO A PERSON LESS UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. WOULD DOT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL AND I HAVE TWO WITNESSES WAS STARTING WITH MISTER ALLEN. HER COLLINI WHO IS THE FATHER OF THE FOURTEEN YEAR OLD THAT I SPOKE ABOUT WHO PURCHASE A WEAPONS ONLINE AND ALSO MR AT HOWARD. WHO IS WITH THE CHILDREN OF CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY INSTITUTE DEL WITHOUT MISTER OR CLEANING GO IF YOU? AS A PARENT I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO LIMIT ACCESS INTERNET AND ONE OF THE SITES ARE SEND VISITS HOWEVER HE'S A TEENAGER. RARELY LISTENS. IT'S NOT PERFECT AND IT ALWAYS FOLLOW OUR RULES. I UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES HAVE FOR KEEPING UP WITH THE ONGOING CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND PROTECTING CONSUMERS. THEREFORE I'M NOT EXPECTING PERFECTION FROM COMPANIES. THAT CONDUCT BUSINESS ONLINE HOWEVER I DO EXPECT COMPANIES TO CONDUCT BUSINESS ONLINE TO BE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD. AS BRICK AND MORTAR BUSINESSES. IT'S HELL TO SPECIAL WHEN IT COMES TO SALES TO MINORS. RIGHT NOW SOME ONLINE BUSINESSES ARE NOT EVEN TRYING TO BE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD. MY SON WAS DIAGNOSED WITH MAJOR DEPRESSION DISORDER MODERATE ANXIETY DISORDER. IMPOSE CONTROL IN CONDUCT DISORDER. MY SON WAS ABLE TO USE A GIFT CARD TO PURCHASE THROWING KNIVES AND HIGH POWERED BB GUN THROUGH AMAZON. MAINLY BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ELECTRIFICATION WHEN PURCHASING THOSE PRODUCTS. WHEN ONLINE RETAILERS LIKE AMAZON ARE SELLING PRODUCTS THEY DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE SELLING AND WHAT CONDITIONS. WHO THEIR SONGS YOU LOOK EMISSIONS MAY HAVE? ALL THE MORE REASON FOR COMPANIES CONDUCTING BUSINESS ONLINE TO TAKE REASONABLE ACTION TO PREVENT SALES TO MINORS. THESE COMPANIES DON'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT. BUT THEY MUST DO BETTER WHEN IT COMES INSURING THE SAFETY OF CONSUMERS. AB TWO FIVE ONE ONE WILL ENSURE THAT ONLINE RETAILERS MUST TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO VERIFY. THE AGE OF THE PURCHASER OF PRODUCTS ILLEGAL TO SELL TO MINOR. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWO FIVE ONE ONE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AT HOWARD SENIOR COUNCIL OF THE CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY INSTITUTE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO SCHOOL OF LAW PLEASED. TO SPONSOR THIS MEASURE BEFORE I BEGIN I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL OF THE HARD WORK AND EXCELLENT WORK. UP PUT IN BY THE A COMMITTEE STAFF AND WENT THROUGH THE CHAIR. THANK THEM FOR THAT. ON. CURRENT LAW HAS PROVEN INSUFFICIENT. TO THE TASK. OF PREVENTING MAJOR COMPANIES FROM SEEKING ONE. TO SELL ITEMS THAT ARE ILLEGAL TO SELL TO CHILDREN. AND TO FROM GETTING PARENTAL PERMISSION. TO USE THE CHILD AS PART OF AN ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN USER CHILD'S FACE AND NAME CARRILLO HAS PROVEN INADEQUATE TO THE TASK TO PREVENT MAJOR COMPANIES. FROM SEEKING TO OBTAIN PARENTAL CONSENT FOR THESE TWO SORTS OF THINGS. BY STICKING IN BOILERPLATE TERMS AND CONDITIONS WORDS THAT ALLOW A CHILD. SILENTLY TO PROMISE TO NOBODY. BUT THEY HAVE THE PARENTS PERMISSION TO DO THOSE THINGS. AS AMENDED THIS BILL APPROACHES THAT PROBLEM WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY NOT ANY KIND OF MEANINGFUL PARENTAL CONSENT IS THE GIVING UP. ANY HOPE OF TRYING TO GET PARENTAL CONSENT THIS BILL AS AMENDED SEEKS TO DO APPROACH THAT PROBLEM INTO VERY NARROW WAYS. FIRST IF AN INTERNET COMPANY ELECTS TO BE AMONG THOSE THAT SELL. ITEMS THAT ARE ILLEGAL TO SELL TO CHILDREN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND MANY OTHER STATES BY THE WAY. THAT ARE LEGAL TO SELL. UNDER THIS BILL AND I'M QUOTING FROM THE BILL. SUCH A COMPANY HAS TO TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO VERIFY AGE. AND QUOTE CANNOT DELIVER OR CAUSE TO BE DELIVERED. THOSE ITEMS. TO ANYONE UNDER EIGHTEEN. WHEN IT COMES TO THE SOCIAL MEDIA FACET OF THE BILL. IT IS AGAIN EXTREMELY NARROW IT ONLY APPLIES TO WIN A COMPANY SEEKS TO ENLIST MY DAUGHTER'S FACE OR MY DAUGHTER'S NAME TO ENDORSE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. WHEN THAT CAMPAIGN IS PAID FOR BY A THIRD PARTY AGAIN QUOTING FROM THE BILL. IT SEE IT ONLY APPLIES WHEN THERE IS A COMPANY THAT IS. PAID BY A THIRD PARTY. TO DISPLAY THE MINOR'S NAME PICTURE OR INFORMATION THAT COULD REASONABLY USED TO IDENTIFY THE MINOR AGAIN THAT APPLIES ONLY IN CIRCUMSTANCES. WHERE A MAJOR COMPANY IS IN LISTING MY CHILD'S FACE AND NAME TO ENDORSE PRODUCTS? HOW DOES THE BILL DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE? AGAIN VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD QUOTE. PRIOR CONSENT PRIOR PARENTAL CONSENT IS REQUIRED AND QUOTE. SECOND PARENTAL CONSENT CAN FOR THAT CAN THAT KIND OF UNIQUE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY AGAIN THE LEVERAGING MY CHILD'S FACE AND NAME FOR ADVERTISING PURPOSES. SHALL BE SEPARATE QUOTE UNQUOTE FROM THE BOILERPLATE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. THAT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE A PROPORTIONAL TO THE THING BEING ASKED. AND THIRD AND MOST OBVIOUSLY THE BILL PROHIBITS PARENTAL CONSENT FROM RESPECTFULLY PREPOSTEROUSLY BEING OBTAINED. BY ASKING A CHILD IN BOILERPLATE TERMS AND CONDITIONS WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE GOTTEN THEIR PARENTS PERMISSION TO BE ON THE SITE. BY QUOTES AND PARENTAL CONSENT SHALL NOT BE OBTAINED THROUGH THE MINOR. THAT'S THE BILL MISTER CHAIRMAN. NOW TWO QUICK OF THINGS IN CONCLUSION AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND YOUR TIME. THE FIRST IS NO AGE VERIFICATION SYSTEM. THAT IS ALL PERFECT. WHEN MY CHILD. BRINGS HOME A PARENTAL PERMISSION SLIP. FOR A. A FIELD TRIP. IT IS PERFECTLY POSSIBLE THAT IF SHE COULD SIGN IT AND SEND IT BACK. ON HER OWN. IT IS PERFECTLY POSSIBLE THAT A CHILD COULD FORGE. A NOTE SAYING THAT THEY WERE ABSENT LEGITIMATELY. THAT'S THE WAY THE REAL THREE DIMENSIONAL. WORLD WORKS AND WE HAVE NEVER IN RESPONSE TO THAT CHALLENGE WE HAVE NEVER SAID. WELL LET'S JUST GIVE UP. SINCE A CHILD COULD FORGE MY SIGNATURE. ON A PARENTAL PERMISSION SLIP LET'S JUST NOT HAVE THEM. SINCE THE CHILD COULD FAKE ID AND ALCOHOL WHICH JUST. FORGET ABOUT AGE VERIFICATION LET'S GIVE UP. AND SECOND. I APPRECIATE ENORMOUSLY THE WORK THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS DONE. UP IN IN ON BEHALF OF THE INSTITUTE WE REMAIN AND I KNOW THAT THE CHAIRS IS ISN'T OF THE SAME MIND. WILLING ABLE EAGER. TO ENGAGE WITH ANY BUSINESS THAT WILL ACTUALLY SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH US AND ENGAGE ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH PRACTICAL PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL I AM EAGER. TO DO IT WE HAVE TO THE EXTENT THAT GROUPS HAVE ENGAGE WITH US. BEEN ABLE SO FAR TO PREVENT OPPOSITION FROM EVERY SINGLE GROUP THAT ACTUALLY ENGAGE WITH US IT IS MY HOPE AND AIM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AS WELL. ON BUT RIGHT NOW THIS BILL REQUIRES ONLY THE THINGS THAT EVERY FOUNDATION ONLY RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS IN OUR OPINION SHOULD DO AND I RESPECTFULLY. FOREVER. I THINK THE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESS IN SUPPORT ME NOW PARCHMENT FOR. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST KATHY RANKIN CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION FOR YOUTH AND CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR CHILDREN'S SAFETY AND HEALTH IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M ELIZABETH COOLEY SEE I'M VICE PRESIDENT OF COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION AND WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. TENACITY LISTS PARENT VOLUNTEER FOR COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION REACHING YOUR FULL SUPPORT. BECAUSE OF HIM THAT I MEAN IS NOT SIMILAR CHILDREN NOW IN STRONG SUPPORT. MORNING CARVEL WITH THEIR AND A STRATEGY GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION CALIFORNIA SINCE. CHAIR MEMBER TRUST BUT THAT THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OR LIVE IN BETWEEN POSITIONS. WE WERE PREVIOUSLY OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE BUT WITH AMENDMENTS OUTLINED ANNOUNCES WERE THEIR OPPOSITION GOING TO NEUTRAL. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MR VICE CHAIRMAN. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE KEVIN KELLY WAS INTERNET ASSOCIATION. FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO SAY THAT THESE ISSUES REGARDING SAFETY MINORS OR SOMETHING THAT. OUR MEMBERS TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY. AND CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW PROVIDES ROBUST PROTECTIONS IN THIS AREA AND FEDERAL LAW. INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS THOSE UNDER THIRTEEN TEENAGERS. ALLOWING A LOT OF CONTROL. FOR MINORS INCLUDING ALLOWING THEM TO REMOVE CONTENT FROM WEBSITES ETCETERA THIS LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN THAT REGARD. THE BILL UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT A STRAIGHT FORWARD AND NARROW I THINK IS IS CAME ACROSS. BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO SELLING. MINERS INFORMATION. AND IT'S NOT JUST WANTED TO ADVERTISING. SO ON THE CONTRARY IT CONCERN IS. THAT THE BILL APPLIES TO MINOR SHARING INFORMATION ON THESE PLATFORMS. AND. SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE. CONSTRUCTED SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH ACCORDING TO YOU ARE YOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES PICTURES YOU'RE TAKING. ACCEPT IRA. SO CONCERNED THAT THE REACHING IMPACT OF THE BILL IN THAT REGARD IS MUCH BROADER. THEN. MAYBE IS THE INTENT. AND ONE THING THAT WAS REFERENCED. IN THE OPENING STATEMENTS OF THE PROPONENTS A SPONSOR. IS A CONCERN ABOUT COMPANIES USING THE LIKENESS OF A MINOR WITH ADVERTISING. NO. IF THAT'S THAT CONCERN HERE IN ASPEN NO CONCERN CALIFORNIA LAW ALREADY REGULATES THAT IT REQUIRES PARENTS WILL CONSENT. IN THAT REGARD THAT'S. WITH THE RIGHT OF PUBLICITY THE RIGHT TO CONTROL WHO YOU ARE IF ANYONE'S MAKING MONEY ON THAT THAT'S ALREADY DRESSED IN CALIFORNIA LAW. SO THIS. THIS BILL ON BOTH PIECES THE SOCIAL MEDIA PIECE IN THE RESELLER PIECE. REGULATES ALREADY REGULATED ACTIVITY ALREADY PROHIBITED CONDUCT AND IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE MECHANICS OF HOW THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL. DOESN'T HELP SHED LIGHT ON WHAT THOSE MECHANICS OR. AND. THERE IS REFERENCE THAT. THE COMPANY SHOULD TAKE REASONABLE MEASURES TO DO THESE THINGS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA PIECE THE BILL REQUIRES PERFECTION. STRICT LIABILITY THAT. THESE WEBSITES FIGURE OUT. THE AGE OF EVERYONE ON THE PLATFORM AND TO THE PARENT HITS. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. WAS VERY CONCERNING TO US. AND THE MECHANICS OF HOW TO DO THAT ESCAPE US AT THIS TIME. THE ONLY THING YOU KNOW THE ONLY WAY IF POTENTIALLY DOING ESCORTING MUCH MORE VERY SENSITIVE INFORMATION THAT I DON'T THINK. MANY PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE WITH HIM COMPANIES. GETTING. AND AGAIN A STRICT LIABILITY ON WEBSITE LEARNING THE TRUE AGE NINETEEN THE OF EVERYONE ON THE PLATFORM. EXTREMELY DIFFICULT THE ONEROUS. IN FUNDAMENTAL WAYS TO CAMINO CSUS NOSE MINERS HAVE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS THERE'S NOT A MAGIC. SWITCH THE FLIPS ONLY TURNED EIGHTEEN. MINORS CAN ENTER INTO CONTRACTS SO THE IDEA THAT TEENAGER MAY NOT BUILDING GAGE ALSO FROM YOUR WEBSITE WITHOUT PROVING WHO THEIR PARENT IS IN OBTAINING THAT PARENTS CONSENT. IS VERY CONCERNING. AND WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE'S A SENSITIVITY OF ISSUES OF THE MINERS HAVING. SHE'S A HOME OF THE MINOR SIMPLY CAN'T GET CONSENT TO ENGAGE ON SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITE. AND AS AS MISTER HOWARD. AND KNOWLEDGE YOU MAY NOT BILL TO BE PERFECT. YOU CAN FORGE THAT PERMISSION SLIP. BEGIN THE BILL REQUIRES PERFECTION WITH A STRICT LIABILITY IN THE FIRST SECTION OF THE BILL. WHEN I REFERENCE THE ROBUST PROTECTIONS THERE IN PLACE IN CALIFORNIA LAW AND FEDERAL LAW. AT SOME POINT ALL OF THOSE PROTECTIONS RELY. RELY ON A REPRESENTATION MADE BY THE USER AT SOME POINT. AND SO. THERE'S A REFERENCE MADE THE QUESTION SHOULD BE ASKED. WE'RE NOT DISAGREEING WITH THAT WERE SAYING WHICH THE PROOF IT'S REQUIRED WHERE'S THE BURDEN HOW'RE WE GOING TO DO THAT THOSE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE. SO THIS BILL TOSSES OUT THE APPROACH OF ENTIRE BODY OF CALIFORNIA LAW TO PROTECT MINORS. AND FEDERAL ON THE ISSUE. TO ADDRESS SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY PROHIBITED. AND CURRENT LAW. SO THOSE ARE CONCERNS REALLY WITH THE SOCIAL MEDIA PIECE IT'S NOT DUPLICATE TESTIMONIAL TO TURN IT OVER. GOOD AFTERNOON A MISTER CHAIR MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AT SERIBU WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. WE WISH TO JOIN IN THE REMARKS OF MR MCKINLEY. IN THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION INCLUDING THE EMPHASIS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING CHILD SAFETY ONLINE. I'M ADDITIONALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF OF THE BILL AIMED AT ONLINE RETAIL SALES WE WOULD EMPHASIZE THE FOLLOWING THREE CONCERNS. FIRST WHETHER THE SALES ONLINE OR NOT IT'S ALREADY ILLEGAL TO SELL THE PROHIBITED ITEMS LISTED IN THIS BILL TO MINORS THE COMPANY VIOLATES THE CURRENT LAW THERE ARE THE SUBJECT TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. SECOND GIVEN THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE LEGISLATING THE MECHANISM BY WHICH COMPANIES COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE COMPANIES TO VERIFY THE AGE OF A PURCHASER WHICH IS BEYOND REQUIRING AN ID CHECK OF THE PERSON AT DELIVERY. WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE PURCHASER? OUR MEMBER COMPANIES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER THEY CAN VERIFY THE AGE OF SOMEONE AT POINT OF SALE. BUYING ONLINE. AND FINALLY THIS LANGUAGES PRESENTED WHEN THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES WENT PUBLIC JUST A FEW DAYS AGO. LANGUAGE SEEKS TO MAKE CHANGES TO A MASSIVE MARKETPLACE. THE BILL WOULD WORK BOWL THIS WOULD REQUIRE A GREAT DEAL MORE THOUGHT AND SUBSTANTIVE POLICY DISCUSSIONS AS TO HOW IT WOULD WORK AN IS THE UNANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY RESULT. FOR EXAMPLE THE NEW LANGUAGE STATES THAT A COMPANY MAY NOT DELIVER PRESCRIBED PRODUCTS TO A PERSON UNDER EIGHTEEN OR WHAT IF A COMPANY. HAS A POLICY NOT TO DELIVER CERTAIN PRODUCTS TO MINOR BUT THEN A THIRD PARTY DELIVERY SERVICE DOES SO ANYWAY WHO IS LIABLE IN THAT SITUATION. ANOTHER CONSIDERATION BE THE FACT THAT COMPANIES WOULD NEED TO BE ABLE TO CREATE A DELIVERY VERIFICATION SERVICE OVERNIGHT IN A REASONABLE. AN APPROPRIATE IMPLEMENTATION DATE WOULD BE TO BE CONSIDERED THERE'S LIKELY MUCH MORE WERE STILL TRYING TO GET A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION. SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS I WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NOVO. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIRMAN REYES LARA BENNETT WITH TECH NET WE ASSOCIATE OUR POSITION WITHOUT OF CAL CHAMBER INTEREST ISSUE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR JUSTIN FANS ARE BEHALF AGAINST CARD APOLOGIES FOR THE LATE OPPOSITION WITH THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS MY CLIENTS OR COUNSEL JUST COMFORTABLE WITH MEAN SAID THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT THE PROVISIONS EXTEND TO ITEMS BEYOND THOSE THAT HER. OF ILLEGAL TO SELL TO MINORS I HAVE TO ENGAGE WITH SPONSORING THE AUTHOR ON THAT ISSUE BUT WE WERE NOT COME. IN IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CONVERSATION UNTIL WE SOLVE THIS MOST RECENT MOMENTS APPRECIATE THAT STAFF TRYING TO WORK ON THAT BUT WILL HAVE TO. REMAIN OPPOSED TO WE CAN WORK THAT OUT WITH MITCHELL COUNCIL TAX. MARGARET CLASSY NUMBER HAVE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION AND WE WERE NOT OPPOSED TO THE PREVIOUS VERSION WITH AMENDMENTS YOU AUTHORS TAKEN AND WE ARE STILL REVIEWING BUT I BELIEVE. SPIRIT OF THE CHAMBER RAISE LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS OF CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION ALSO SHARE AND SO FOR THAT REASON WE NEED TO EXPRESS CONCERN ABOUT THE BELL ON MALES PLANNED UP IN OPPOSITION THANK. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR PUTTING MEMBERS MISTER MALONE. THING WITH SHARON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR BRINGING THE BILL THIS DIFFICULT ISSUE BUT I I THINK IT'S A. A RIGHTEOUS EFFORT I THINK YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. A STRONGER IN THIS AREA I JUST WANTED TO OF AFFORD YOU THE OPPORTUNITY. BEFORE WE GET A MOTION A SECOND TAKE A VOTE ON THIS THING. AND AS I INDICATED I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT BUT THE ISSUES AROUND WORKABILITY. AND HOW YOU DETERMINE. H. HOW YOU CAN. ENSURE THAT SOMEBODY IS WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE. AND. MISTER HOWARD TALKED ABOUT THE IMPERFECT NATURE OF THIS I GET IT. AUTUMN BLIGHT I THINK GOING FORWARD WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THOSE WORKABILITY. ISSUES THE. OPPOSITION ALSO RAISE THE. ISSUE AROUND. DUPLICATION OF EXISTING LAW WE JUST WANT TO GIVE THE AUTHOR THE OPPORTUNITY IN PARTICULAR ON THIS. WORKABILITY PIECE HOW THIS WOULD ACTUALLY WORK IN PRACTICE I'M HAVING A LITTLE DIFFICULTY GETTING MY HEAD AROUND BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND OF FIRST OF ALL LET ME LET ME ON. OUR COMMIT TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE THAT I. LOW FOR TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO SORT OUT SOME OF THE. SOME OF THE WORKABILITY ISSUE SAN AND. OF FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE CONCERN THERE. AND THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT THEIR PROTECTING KIDS AND OUT IT'S BEEN MENTIONED ABOUT THE CURRENT LAW. ARE YOU KNOW THE WHICH IS. ACCORDING TO OPPOSITION SUFFICES. HERE YOU KNOW ONE WHO INCOMES PROTECTION PROTECTING OUR KIDS. THE REALITY IS CURRENT LAW DOES NOT PROTECT OUR KIDS FROM FROM BUYING WEAPONS LIKE THESE ON THE WEBSITE. CURRENT LAW DOES NOT. OF PROTECT OUR KIDS FROM HAVING THEIR NAME. AND ALSO THEIR LIKENESS BEING EXPLOITED. ARE. AND THAT EVEN CURRENTLY. WHAT THEY DO IS THEY TRY TO NOT ONLY REACH OUT THE NOT ONLY THE KIDS BUT ALSO THE KIDS FRIENDS WITHIN THEIR CIRCLES WHAT THEY DO IS? THEY USE THE KIDS NAME AND ALSO THEIR PHOTO TO OF BE USED IN FORGOTTEN IN OUR ADVERTISING DIFFERENT PRODUCTS THAT. THE KID DOESN'T REALLY AND DOORS ARE DOESN'T HAVE. ANY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT. AND CURRENT LAW I THINK A OPPOSITION MADE REFERENCE TO CURRENT LAW AND I THINK YOU ARE USUALLY REFERRING TO AYE SP FIVE SIXTY EIGHT WHICH WAS A STEINBERG BILL. WHICH DOES NOT REALLY ADDRESS THE GENERAL PUBLIC IT'S TARGETED TO KIDS ONLY. AND THERE'S ALSO FEDERAL LAW BUT FEDERAL LAW OWNS ONLY PERTAIN SEE KIDS UNDER THE AGE OF THIRTEEN. ON THE OTHER HAND THIS PARTICULAR BILL ARE ADDRESSES THE GENERAL WEBSITES FOR EXAMPLE WEBSITES THAT ARE USED BY BOTH KIDS AND ADULTS. SO IN THAT REGARD. THERE'S NO LAW CURRENT WEATHER Y. FEDERAL OR STATE OR OTHERWISE THAT WOULD COVER THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION. AND ARE AS TO THE OUR. ASSERTION THAT THERE ARE WE ARE DEPRIVING THE KIT ARE HIS SO RIGHTS EITHER CONSTITUTIONAL OR OTHERWISE THAT IS NOT THE CASE BECAUSE THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT SAYS THAT. I EVEN IF THE KID DOES NOT OBTAIN A PARENTAL CONCERN. HERE SHE SHOULD NOT BE DENIED ACCESS TO THE WEBSITE SO THAT'S CLEARLY SPELLED OUT IN THE LANGUAGE ITSELF. AND THE ONLY DOING NOW IS ESSENTIALLY TO SAY LOOK IF THESE THIRD PARTY PEOPLE WANT TO USE THE TILES INFORMATION. NAMES AND. LIKENESS OF PHOTOGRAPHS THEY HAVE TO GET THE PRIOR PARENTAL CONSENT THAT'S NUMBER ONE. THE OTHER PIECE IS THAT. IF THEY WANT TO BUY SOMETHING ILLEGAL AND THOSE COMPANIES ARE TO HOW THEY ARE. SOMETHING COMPLACENT MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN I MEAN THOSE ARE THE TWO MAJOR ISSUES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. BUT HAVING SAID THAT I DO WANT COMMIT MYSELF TO WORKING WOULD YOU KNOW FOLKS TO YOU KNOW SORT OUT THE THE WORKABILITY ISSUES AND HOW WE. YOU KNOW HOW WE GONNA DO THE CONSENT CURRENTLY. THE BILL DOES NOT PRESCRIBE A PARTICULAR METHOD FOR THE. FOR THE FOLKS TO TO GET CONSENT BUT CURRENTLY DRAFTING HAS NOTHING IS BEING DONE SO ANYTHING THAT WE COULD DO IS BETTER THAN NOTHING. SO SO THAT'S THAT'S TO THAT'S THE THE CHEST OF THE OF THE BILL. AND AND IT'S A TOTALLY REASONABLE BILL IN MY VIEW. IF I JUST. FOLLOW UP ON THAT AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT SOMETHING WHICH IS OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE WE WANNA. A THIS SET THE LOSS AT THE STANDARD ALLOW A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY HERE FOR HOW. HOW THE LAW? IS COMPLIED WITH WHAT MISTER HOWARD YOU WANT SPEECH AT THAT ISSUE. HIS WE HEARD FROM. AT THE OPPONENTS. AS WELL ON THE. SORT OF PRESCRIPTIVE NATURE OF THIS BUT I JUST HEARD THE OTHER SAY WERE WERE NOT. WELL IT IS. WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE. YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE YOUR POISON RISK WITH NO DISRESPECT. WITH AN OPPOSITION THAT WILL ENGAGE. SO EITHER WE COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING VERY PRESCRIPTIVE. WHICH WOULD PROVIDE REGULATED ENTITIES ABSOLUTE CRYSTALLINE CLARITY ABOUT HOW TO COMPLY WITH IT. AND THEN THE OPPOSITION WOULD BE HERE SAYING YOU'RE STIFLING INNOVATION YOUR E. OR PREVENTING US FROM BEING ABLE TO INNOVATE OUR WAY OUT OF A PROBLEM. THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO TAKE THE APPROACH THAT IS CURRENTLY SEEN IN THE BILL WHICH WE SEE. THROUGHOUT MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF LAWS. IT THE AT. THAT IS. EGGMAN REASONABLE STEPS TO VERIFY AGE. I DID THE GENTLEMAN. UP FROM THE OPPOSITION WAS TALKING ABOUT QUESTIONS RELATED TO BURDEN. QUESTIONS RELATING TO PROVE. I MY THAT THAT THE CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY INSTITUTE AND ITS SISTER ORGANIZATION THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEREST. ORG DEEPLY COMMITTED TO BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE A CLEAR LAW. THAT IS NOT IN ANY WAY A GOTCHA. THAT ALLOWS EVERY SINGLE COMPANY WITH ABSOLUTE CLARITY TO BE ABLE TO CONFORM THEIR BEHAVIOR IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. IN ORDER FOR US TO DO THAT IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE FOR THE OPPOSITION. I NEED THEM TO SIT DOWN AND ENGAGE AND SAY WHAT WOULD WORK FOR YOU AND WHAT WOULDN'T. WE ARE ABSOLUTELY EAGER I AM IMPLORING THEM TO DO SO. SO ON THE WORKABILITY ISSUES I CONCEDE THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WORD REASONABLE STEPS TO VERIFY AGE. THAT IS NOT PER SCRIPTED THERE IS SOME UNKNOWABLE THERE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WHAT YOU'RE DOING. IS GOING TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH LAW TO THE EXTENT AS THAT IS A CONCERN. LET'S FIGURE IT OUT. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT ALSO OFFERS THESE COMPANIES A ZILLION DIFFERENT INNOVATIVE WAYS. TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS AGE VERIFICATION EVERYTHING FROM THERE'S A SPIN CLASS THAT DID THAT ONE WOMAN FRIEND OF MINE OWNS YOU GO ONLINE YOU CLICK HERE. YOU IT'S ONE PERSON NOT FACEBOOK NOT IT WAS ON ONE PERSON OWNS THIS YOU GO ONLINE YOU CLICK TO ENROLL IT ASKS FOR YOUR AGE IF THE AGE OF THE PERSON IS YOUNGER IT GOES TO A FORM. IT JUST FILLS OUT. YOU KNOW KIND LONG HERE'S MY EMAIL ADDRESS MY KID CAN DO IT TO MY MIND. THAT'S FINE. AND IT'S A MILLION TIMES BETTER THAN THE STATUS QUO. CURRENT LAW HAS PROVEN TO BE INADEQUATE TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT STATUS QUO. WHICH IS RESPECTFULLY PREPOSTEROUS WHICH NO ONE HERE HAS DEFENDED. WHICH IS IN BOILERPLATE TERMS AND CONDITIONS WHEN FACEBOOK SEEKS TO USE MY CHILD IS A BILLBOARD FOR ADVERTISING. BAY AREA IN BOILERPLATE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND SAY QUOTE IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. YOU REPRESENTED THAT A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN ALSO EXPRESSLY AGREES TO THIS. SO THAT'S THE STATUS QUO. THAT CLEARLY IS NOTHING. WE CAN AS THE FIRST WITNESS SAID DO BETTER WE SHOULD DO BETTER. THIS BILL IS VERY CLEAR. ABOUT THE DIRECTION THAT BETTER SHOULD GO INTO THE EXTENT OF THEIR WORK ABILITY ISSUES I WOULD. YOU EARN UP TO WORK THEM OUT. THANK YOU THAT I'M OF THE BILL. MS BAKER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER FOR THOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO GO A LITTLE BIT DEEPER INTO THE LANGUAGE AT REGARDING. THE. REASONABLE STEPS AND FIRST FALL COMPLETELY AGREE AS A PARENT OF TWO TEENAGERS. WITH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. AND ALSO TO TO MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT IS MEANINGFUL THAT IT'S NOT A. A CONSENT THAT IS SOMETHING MY KIDS ARE JUST GONNA. BE ABLE TO IGNRE WHICH IN MY DO. UP OR THAT IT IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE ANY PURPOSE TO IT BECAUSE MAYBE ESTO BURIED SOMEWHERE. MINDFUL THAT WE THIS THE LEGISLATURE ENDS GOVERNMENT PUTS A LOT OF DISCLOSURE BURDENS ALREADY. THAT GET HIDDEN IN THERE SO WE SOMETIMES CREATE THE PROBLEM OURSELVES. SO WHEN IT COMES TO REASONABLE STEPS. WE HAD EARLIER BILL HERE TODAY WERE HEADS ARE SIMILAR LANGUAGE ABOUT REASONABLENESS AND I BROUGHT UP THE CONCEPT OF A SAFE HARBOR MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN THE BILL BUT THE NEED FOR ONE. AND THIS DOESN'T HAVE WINE AND I I JUST WANNA PLAY OUT A LITTLE BIT. HOW THIS PRACTICALLY HAPPENS IS A COMPANY WILL NOW HAVE TO TRY TO GAS WHAT IS REASONABLE? AND INEVITABLY THERE GONNA PUT TIME AND MONEY AND EFFORT INTO THAT. AND WE WANT THEM TO DO SOME. TIME AND MONEY AND EFFORT INTO PROTECTING OUR KIDS BUT THEN THE LITIGATION THAT COMES LATER IS VERY VERY EXPENSIVE. JUST TO DO A MOTION TO DISMISS WHERE THE YOUNG WHICH THEY WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO GET PAST BECAUSE THE. QUESTION OF REASONABLE S. IS A FACT QUESTION THAT THEN IS A SUMMARY JUDGMENT AGAIN. GUY AND GOD FORBID YOU ACTUALLY GO TO TRIAL YOU'RE LOOKING AT HALF A MILLION DOLLARS. S. AND THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. WHICH DIVERTS RE RESOURCES AWAY FROM BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY PUT IT INTO THE BUSINESS AND COMPLY. HAVING A SAFE HARBOR IS HELPFUL. AYE AYE OF MY FIRST QUESTION BE ARE YOU ARE YOU OPEN TO HAVING SAFE HARBORS THAT. I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T SAY THIS IS THE ONE WAY MAYBE IT'S THE. SPIN CLASS WHATEVER EXAMPLE BUT HERE'S ONE WAY. BUT THE SAFE HARBOR THE GIVES COMPANIES SOME BASIS TO UNDERSTAND WORKING EVEN HAVE A DEFICIENCY A MORE EFFICIENT STARTING POINT. AND SECONDLY. EVEN AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE THAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE KNOWING THAT THE FROM A DEFENSE CAN BE USED UNTIL AGAIN THE FACT QUESTION IS HAPPENED SO A LOT OF MONEY. IS GOING TO STILL BE AN INCENTIVE FOR BUSINESSES TO GET IT RIGHT. CAN YOU COMMENT ON EITHER OF THOSE TWO. POINTS I HAVE YOU MORE AFTER THAT FAILING TO TAKE A STAB AT IT AND I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO MISTER HOWARD. LA WOULD RESPECT YOU FIRST QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT DEL WE'RE OPEN TO HAVING SAFE HARBORS IS DEFINITELY WHERE TO FULLY OPEN TO. A NEGOTIATION AND INCOME COMPOSITION WITH THE OPPOSITION TO SLIDE OUT WHAT THOSE SO YOU KNOW BASIC. SAFE HARBORS WOULD BE CELLS ON YOU KNOW TOOK THAT'S TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE AT THE TERM REASONABLE AS I THINK I THINK. LOW WE HAVE SEEN NO TIME AND AGAIN DURING LITIGATION OTHERWISE. OB THAT WE HAVE OUT WE USED A REASONABLE PERSON STANDARD IN THE IN THE CASE OF NEGLIGENCE SO I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S NOT AS THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE A STANDARD IN PLACE I THINK. LITIGATION THAT'S USE ALL THE TIME SO I YOU KNOW AND FINAL IMAGE YOU SEE THAT. DEBATE THE BILL DOESN'T PROVIDE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. NOW IT IS UP TO THE AG OR THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHO WOULD MAKE THAT DETERMINATION WHETHER OR NOT TO BRING ABOUT TO THE ACTION. SO SO I'LL WHETHER NOT THEY WANT TO USE REASONABLE STATE STANDARD OR OTHERWISE I THINK YOU KNOW BUT BUT. YOU KNOW THAT'S UP TO THEM BUT YET I'M OPEN TO HAVING GOT KIND OF A CONVERSATION AS TO WHETHER NOT SAFE HARBOR WOULD BE NEEDED MISS HOW. THE THE CHAIR AT A FAMILY MEMBER AND THE ANSWER IS YES CIVIL. I LIKE. SAFE HARBORS I THINK THAT THEY STAY IF THEY'RE DONE PROPERLY. STRIKE A REALLY WONDERFUL BALANCE BETWEEN PROVIDING REGULATED ENTITIES COMPLETE CERTAINTY IN COMPLETING THEIR BEHAVIOR WITH THE LAW. BUT ALSO FREEING REGULATED ENTITIES TO BE ABLE TO INNOVATE IN WAYS THAT MAY NOT BE CONTEMPLATED BY THE SAFE HARBOR SO I I LIKE MY ALSO LIKE THE IDEAL THOUGH. OF AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE AGAIN CAREFULLY CRAFTED. IT COULD SERVE NOT TO PREVENT A LAWSUIT BUT TO A BE ABLE TO DISMISS ONE AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY AT LEAST EXPENSE ALSO NOTE. OF FOR THE RECORD THAT NOT ONLY DOES THE BILL NOT PROVIDE FOR A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BUT THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS ELIMINATED. THE A PROVISION OF THE BILL AS WAS INTRODUCED THAT FORBADE ARBITRAGE. THAT FORBADE. COMPANIES FROM. FROM PROHIBITING PEOPLE FROM. CLASSING UP INTO A CLASS. SO INCREASINGLY THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT ARE PUTTING IN PROHIBITIONS. AGAINST PEOPLE. ARE TEAMING UP IN A CLASS ACTION ORIGINALLY THE BILL HAD SOMETHING THAT SAID YOU COULDN'T DO THAT THAT LIKEWISE HAS BEEN REMOVED. BUT ALSO SAID THE BILL WOULD MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THERE CAN BE A CLASS ACTION OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND OKAY HE I WASN'T CLEAR ON WHAT YOU ARE SAYING HOW THE OTHER WAY AROUND PLEASE. THE THE ORIGINAL BILL OF AS WAS INTRODUCED. SAID THAT A COMPANY COULD NOT. PROHIBIT PEOPLE. FROM JOINING UP INTO A CLASS GOT I'VE GOT A FEW MORE QUESTIONS I THINK THAT SONG I THINK YOU AND I. I DON'T WANT TO YES THERE IS A REASONABLE STANDARD ALL THROUGHOUT THE LAW IT'S JUST REALLY REALLY EXPENSIVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT IS AND THESE ARE ALL RESOURCES GOING AWAY FROM. ENTERPRISES THAT ARE OTHERWISE DOING LEGITIMATE WORK AND WE DON'T WE WE DO PLENTY OF CREATING THAT BURDEN ON THEM AND I'M VERY GLAD THERE IS A POT AND HERE. WOODEN UNDERVALUE THE FACT THAT IF THE AG GETS TO DO THIS. SOMETIMES THAT'S. JUST AS BAD BECAUSE THEN YOU'VE GOT A CLAIM FROM AG AGAINST YOUR. YOUR BUSINESS AND TRYING TO DETERMINE REASONABLENESS I DON'T UNDER I'M A DILUTED IMPACT THAT THAT HAS. AND SECONDLY THE THE LANGUAGE WE HAVE THE WORD VERIFY. IT'S NOT JUST THAT THEY HAVE TO TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT THE PURCHASER IS NOT A MINOR OR OR OTHERWISE BUT YOU WANT VERIFICATION. I DON'T KNOW HOW OPEN YOU ARE TO THAT AS WELL HOW COME I TRY TO WATER IT DOWN IT TRULY IS. YOU WANT TO SET A A REACH. REASONABLE WAGE EVEN VERIFY VERIFIES QUITE A HIGH STANDARD WHEN I SAW THAT WORD DIFFICULT TO DO. PEOPLE FAKE ID'S STILL TO THIS DAY I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WOULD HAVE THAT I JUST AS ONEROUS STANDARD THERE. AND. IN ADDITION THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHAT THIS APPLIES TO. SO WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA BUT MY REED OF THE BILL AS IT APPLIES TO ALMOST ANYTHING ON THE INTERNET. AND. I SHARE THE CONCERN IS THAT ME MOMMY DOESN'T LET OUR KIDS ON SESSION HE. I SHARE THE CONCERN OF HAVING YOU KNOW THIS THESE QUESTIONS OF SOCIAL MEDIA BUT. THEY CHILDREN DO YOU USE THE INTERNET A LOT FOR HOMEWORK NOW AND WEBSITES THAT HAVE. THAT THIS WOULD APPLY TOO. AND I WONDER IF YOU CAN CLARIFY JUST HOW BROAD THIS IS BECAUSE ALL THE CONVERSATION SO FAR HAS BEEN ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES. WHATEVER THAT'S DEFINED AS AND. I NOT BASICALLY WHAT I SEE WHICH IS THE ENTIRE INTERNET JUST ABOUT EVERY WEBSITE THIS IS GONNA APPLY TO HIM. BUT. CUT. SOME THROUGH THE CHAIR AGAIN. SO. THE BILL SO. THERE IS A CONUNDRUM WHEN YOU'RE ATTEMPTING. TO REGULATE SOCIAL MEDIA AND THAT IS THERE SIMPLY ISN'T A GOOD DEFINITION. I LOOKED AT EVERY SINGLE ONE. THERE SIMPLY ISN'T A TERRIFIC DEFINITION OF WHAT A SOCIAL MEDIA SITE IS THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE BILL ATTEMPTED TO DO THAT. THE AMENDED VERSION OF THE BILL GIVES UP ON. AND HE'S LIKE INSTEAD OF ATTEMPTING TO REGULATE THE BEHAVIOR OF A COMPANY BASED ON WHAT IT IS. IT'S NOW REGULATES THE BEHAVIOR A COMPANY BASED ON WHAT IT OBJECTIVELY. DOT. AND I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE ABOUT THE BREADTH OF THE BILL FOR THAT VERY REASON THE SOCIAL MEDIA PART QUOTE UNQUOTE THE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOES NOT APPLY DEFINITIONAL. MEANING WHAT IS OR IS NOT A SOCIAL MEDIA SITE IT APPLIES. OBJECTIVELY BASED ON VERBS THAT THE COMPANY DOES QUOTE IS PAID BY A THIRD PARTY TO DISPLAY THE MINOR'S NAME PICTURE OR INFORMATION THAT COULD REASONABLY.  <u><c.green>BE USED TO</c></u> IDENTIFY THE MINOR AND QUOTE. THAT'S THE BILL. IF YOU DON'T DO THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT. OUT ARRANGEMENTS I MEAN ACTUALLY THE BILL SAYS MORE COMPLETELY QUOTE SEEKS TO USE A MINOR'S NAME PICTURE INFORMATION ABOUT A MINOR PURSUANT TO AN ARRANGEMENT. IN WHICH A PERSON OR BUSINESS IS PAID BY A THIRD PARTY TO DISPLAY THE MINOR'S NAME PICTURE OR INFORMATION THAT COULD RESULT IN ABOUT MONEY IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF PROCESS. THIS BILL DOES NOT APPLY. THE WHOLE REST OF THE INTERNET THE ALMOST INFINITE VARIETY OF THE INTERNET THAT DOESN'T DO THAT PARTICULAR KIND OF SELLING MY CHILD'S FACE AND NAME TO THIRD PARTIES. YOU CAN WHATEVER THEY WANT OKAY AND LIKEWISE WITH THE WITH THE OTHER PIECE THAT APPLIES ONLY TO COMPANIES THAT SELL ITEMS ON THE INTERNET THAT ARE ILLEGAL TO SELL TO MINORS OKAY BECAUSE I DO SEE. AND IN THAT FIRST AREA THAT THE. YOU KNOW SIXTIES MINER'S NAME PICTURE OR ANY INFORMATION. ABOUT MY HER SO I'M LOOKING AT THAT AYE I APPRECIATE. IT IT SOUNDS LIKE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE IS. SEEN SOME OF THE NEED ON THIS ISSUE. TO ADDRESS THE RECENT US AND WHAT THE COMPANIES ARE BEING. BOUND BY AYE. GIVE A HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE LESS. DISCUSSION OF WHO'S COMING TO THE TABLE AND WHO ISN'T BECAUSE NOT REALLY PRODUCTIVE BUT THAT THEY'RE JUST BE AN OPEN DOOR AND THAT THERE IS GENUINELY TAKING AS I'M SURE THE CHARITY PENSION DOING. SUGGESTIONS ON THIS TIME BECAUSE I I THINK. IN ITS CURRENT FORM IT REALLY IS. VERY BROAD AND CAN LEAD TO IT AND VERY DIFFICULT STANDARD TO. EMPLOYMENT I. SPECIFYING WHEN I HAVE IS ON THAT I'M ENVISIONING FULFILLMENT CENTERS. THAT IF THEY'RE GONNA SELL IT THEY'RE GONNA DELIVER MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF PRODUCT TO A. HOUSEHOLD YOU KNOW I'VE. PROBABLY ALL GOT AND TOWARDS SOME OF LARGER FULFILLMENT CENTERS DETER. PUTTING A LOT OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS IN THE BOX HOW YOU'RE ANTICIPATING A FULFILLMENT CENTER LAW WOULD BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THAT. ASSURANCE THAT A PRODUCT THAT THE CHILD IS NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE IS NOT DELIVERED TO THE HOUSEHOLD. YEAH ON THAT PIECE WE NEED WE NEED TO. FINE TUNED OUT A LITTLE BIT AS WE GO I THINK I THINK THAT'S US ANTI THAT'S BEEN RAISED RECENTLY AND OUT. OF YOU KNOW WILL YOU KNOW WHO ARE VERY HAPPY TO KIND OF WORK WITH OPPOSITION TO SEE HOW YOU KNOW COULD BE WORKED OUT. SO SO THAT DIDN'T YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD IT'S A LEGITIMATE QUESTION AND HAVE SO BUT I DO WANNA. ARE CLEAR THE AIR ON SOMETHING ON STRICT LIABILITY WHICH IS THE BILL IS NOT IS NOT A STRICT LIABILITY CODE CASE WHATSOEVER SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW. MEMBERS DON'T GET DATA CONCEPT YEAH I THINK WHEN THERE'S. I. LOOK AT IT TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE I DID HAVE THAT QUESTION TO THEM EVERY OF A REASONABLENESS STANDARD. DO YOU YOU'RE LIABLE IF YOU'RE NOT REASONABLE BUT YOU WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT HAVING CONFLICTING LANGUAGE THAT WOULD MAKE. TIP THE SCALE TOWARD STRICT LIABILITY WHICH IS IN FACT QUESTION THANK YOU FOR THE INDULGENCE OF THE TIME I APPRECIATE IT. ARE MISTER BERMAN AND THEM IS IRWIN HOLLISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. FOR BRING THE BILL AYE AYE. FRANKLY. THIS SUMMER BAKER ASK A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD. ME IN MY OFFICE ALSO HAD A LOT OF CONFUSION AS TO WHO THE THE BILL APPLIES TO. BUT YOUR EXPLANATION. AGAIN PROVIDED ANSWERS AND PROBABLY ALSO CREATE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS. THAT WILL FOLLOW UP WITH. I THINK YOU KNOW I I APPRECIATE THE INTENTIONALITY WITH WHICH A LOT OF THE THE CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE. TO THE BILL I STILL THINK I AND I AGREE THAT THE CURRENT SITUATION IS INADEQUATE. AND AND I THINK. YOU KNOW OUR OUR POLICY IN OUR LAWS MIGHT BE. WRITTEN CORRECT BUT THE WAY THAT WE IMPLEMENT THEM AREN'T. AND SO BUT AT THE SAME TIME AND I I DON'T TO BE A DEAD HORSE BECAUSE A LOT OF GOOD QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED AND FRANKLY THAT THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL HAS. DE EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THE CONCERNS THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS. AND IF THIS WERE BILL WERE TO COME TO THE FLOOR WHEN SUPPORTED IN ITS CURRENT FORM. THE I THINK IT'S A GOOD CONVERSATION TO HAVE. I I THINK THAT THE GOALS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE OUR AS. A MISTER MULLIN SAID RIGHTEOUS. I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT TERM TO USE. BUT I THINK THERE'S FAR TOO MUCH AMBIGUITY CURRENTLY IN THE BILL. FOR MY COMPATIBILITY AS BEING THE LAST STEP OR EVEN THE MIDDLE STEP GETTING OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY. I'M I'M COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION KEEP ON GOING. I REALLY DO WANT TO ENCOURAGE. EVERYBODY THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S ACCEPTABLE ON OF HAD A VERY FINE. DEVIL'S ADVOCATE CONVERSATIONS WITH BOTH SIDES OF THE BILL. OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN HOURS. AND I I DON'T THINK IT'S SATISFACTORY TO SAY WE LEAVE IT UP TO TECH TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT. I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. YEAH I DON'T THINK TO BE PRESCRIPTIVE IN THE BILL BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE CREATING LAWS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO TO IMPLEMENT BECAUSE THOSE ARE JUST POISON PILLS THAT ARE TRYING TO. PROHIBIT ACTION. GOT IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING. AND SO. I HAVE CONCERNS. ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW THE AYE AYE. IT'S TRUE THAT WE CAN'T LET THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD AND AND IF WE'RE NOT AT A PERFECT STAGE AT THIS POINT. LET'S FIND THE BEST. WAY POSSIBLE. SAID TO THE CHIEF THE POLICY GOALS OF MAKING SURE THAT MINERS. IN A THEIR LIKENESSES AND USED NOW FOR FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT. NOW AND BE THAT THEY CAN'T ACQUIRE. HAVE AGE RESTRICTIONS ON. SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. REALLY WANT TO IMPRESS UPON THE AUTHOR. TO TO WORK WITH THE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE IMPACTED. TO MAKE SURE THAT. YEAH THEY HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE AND AND. CAN CAN IMPROVE THE CURRENT LANGUAGE. BIBLE SUPPORTED AT THIS TIME. THANKS VERY MUCH YOU HAVE LIKE YOU. THAT WRITTEN DOWN A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF. THAT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I COVERED. I MEAN I GUESS WE KNOW SOMEBODY MENTIONED THAT THEY WERE WORRIED THAT IN TERMS OF THE THAT. THE PURCHASING ITEMS ONLINE THAT IT EXTENDS BEYOND ITEMS WITH AIDS LIMITATIONS. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THE OPPOSITION HAS HAS ANY. THING TO ADD TO THAT ARE OF IF YOU DON'T NEED TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T LIKE. IS IS IS THE POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE. AND THEN. AND THEY ALL LEAVE IT AT THAT FOR NOW THINKS. I THINK. ALI HAVE COVERED THE UTMOST MY. QUESTIONS AND ISSUES AND CONCERNS ARE READY AT AYE BY ONE OF THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD AND WORKING TO AND CREATE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR CHILDREN ONLINE. OBVIOUSLY THE INTERNET HAS A MANY PROMISES AND PITFALLS PITFALLS FOR OUR CHILDREN AND IT'S IMPORTANT AS LEGISLATORS WE SEE HOW. A WEEKEND. ADDRESS OF SO I I THINK YOUR GOALS ARE LAUDABLE I HAVE. STILL A NUMBER OF ISSUES OF WITH THE BILL BUT I AM GOING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY AND AND WE'LL SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN IT GETS ONTO THE FLOOR. AND TO A KIND OF REPEAT WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID I I HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY ENGAGE WITH THE. RETAILERS AND SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES BECAUSE THERE ARE REAL IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES. WITH THE AGE VERIFICATION AND AND I DO THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND. WITH TECH LAW HAVE OF FLEXIBILITY. BUT THERE ALSO HAS TO BE AT LEAST WE HAVE TO SEE AT LEAST ONE REASONABLE WAY TO PERFORM. THE FUNCTION. THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE DON'T FIND OFFENSIVE AND SO YOU KNOW I JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT IS. I'D THERE WAS SOME TALK ABOUT HAVING TO USE LET'S SAY. OF PASSPORTS OR OR OTHER TYPE OF. DOCUMENTATION TO PROVE AGE OUT WE WANT TO GET INTO THAT AREA WE DO NOT WANT THE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES OR ONLINE RETAILERS HOLDING ANYMORE OF OUR PRIVATE INFORMATION SO I THINK ALL THAT NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED. AND WE NEED TO KNOW THAT THERE IS A THAT A PATH FORWARD. TO DO THIS AND SO ALL OF THE AS I SAID I I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I NEED TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN IT GETS TO THE FLOOR. PARTICULAR IMAGE. MR OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT MR CHOW I. DEFINITELY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE ON THE BILL. ARE I HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT I JUST RAISE THE ONES THAT I HAVEN'T HEARD REYES SO FAR SO YOU'VE YOU'VE GOT THE BILL DIVIDED INTO TWO SECTIONS YOU'VE GOT SECTION A. THE DEALS WITH ENDORSEMENTS AND SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES AND SECTION BE THAT DEALS WITH THE SHIPMENT OF PHYSICAL GOODS TO MINORS. AND I REALLY WISH THAT YOUHAD JUST SEPARATED THEM AND DETERMINE TWO SEPARATE BILLS BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE. SECTION BE IS A LOT BETTER BATES THAN SECTION A. I OUGHT SOMEONE OF JUST FOCUS ON SECTION A BECAUSE I GOT SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THAT AND THAT THE REASON WHY I'M SO CONCERNED IS THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT OUR INTENTIONS ARE. HERE WHEN WE CRAFTED BILL BUT THE WORDING OF THE BILL IS CRITICAL BECAUSE ONCE IT GETS OUT INTO THE WILD THE COURTS ARE GOING TO INTERPRET IT BASED ON WHAT WE WROTE THEY'RE NOT WHAT OUR INTENTIONS WERE. AND SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE GET IT RIGHT AND. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE STILL THURMOND FIRST OF ALL WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF A SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITE. I DEFINITELY THINK IT'S CRITICAL TO NAIL THAT DOWN BECAUSE OF WHAT MIGHT BE OBVIOUS TO US SITTING HERE WHAT WE MEAN BY SOCIAL MEDIA AND WEBSITE IS NOT OBVIOUS TO. OUR PEOPLE WHO ARE DESIGNING WEBSITES ARE GIVEN EXAMPLE FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW I RUN A. VIDEO GAME DEVELOPMENT STUDIO RIGHT SO WE HAVE LEADER BOARDS. WHERE YOU POST YOUR HIGH SCORES YOU CAN SEE HOW YOU RANK COMPARED WITH ALL THE OTHER PLAYERS OF THE GAME? IS THAT A SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITE. I THINK THAT A CASUAL OBSERVER WOULD SAY NO BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT A DEFINITION I THINK YOU CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT. MAYBE IT IS. ARE WE YOU DON'T DEFINE REALLY ARE HOW. A. WEBSITE PROPRIETORS SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHEN A MINOR HAS ENTERED PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. SO OUR GIVEN EXAMPLE LIKE THE LEADER BOARD EXAMPLE. USERS ENTER A USER NAME OR HANDLE THAT THEY WANT POSTED ON THERE WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT. THAT YOUR REAL NAME THEM IN SOME CASES IT'S OBVIOUS IT'S NOT. WE HAVE TO REGULARLY POLICE THOSE FOR FOUR LETTER WORDS AND ANATOMICAL REFERENCES RIGHT. A PRETTY CLEAR THAT THAT'S NOT THE REAL NAY BUT SOME PEOPLE PUT THEIR REAL NAMES ARE WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT. YOU KNOW THAT'S A REAL NAME AND THEN ARE ALSO IN SECTION I UNDERSTAND THE INTENTION IS TO. PROHIBIT AN ENDORSEMENT TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP BUT THE WORDING. REALLY DOESN'T SAY THAT BECAUSE ALL IT SAYS IS THAT. IF ANYONE GETS PAID FOR THE DISPLAY OF THAT USERS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. THEN THAT IS ILLEGAL AND FRANKLY THAT THAT COVERS A LOT BROADER FIELD THAN JUST AN ENDORSEMENT RELATIONSHIP I MEAN IF WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH. A ANOTHER COMPANY AT THAT IS A PORTAL FOR OUR INFORMATION AND THEY DISPLAY OUR LEADER BOARDS INITIATES IN EXCHANGE FOR THAT. THEY ALSO PUT AN AD FOR OUR PRODUCTS RIGHT WE ARE ESSENTIALLY GETTING PAID BECAUSE WERE RECEIVING SOMETHING OF VALUE THE ADVERTISEMENT. AND THEY'RE DISPLAYING THEIR PERSONAL HERE IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION EVEN THOUGH NO ENDORSEMENT RELATIONSHIP AS IMPLIED IT'S STILL IN VIOLATION OF THE BILL. BOB DYLAN IN ABOUT MY LAST. KIND OF OUR CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM FOR YOU IS. THAT SECTION A UNLIKE SECTION BE DOES NOT HAVE A REASON ABILITY CLAUSE IN IT. IN OTHER WORDS IT'S ALL A SECTION NAY SAYS IS IF. ARE IF A SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITE DISPLAYS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. YOU KNOW IN ENDORSEMENT ATMOSPHERE ALL THE MINOR THEN THEY ARE GUILTY. RIGHT AND EVEN IF THE MINOR TOLD THEM I'M NOT A MINOR. IN SECTION BE SAYS THAT THERE IS THERE'S A REASON ABILITY THING IF IF IF THEY TOOK REASONABLE STEPS TO TRY TO VERIFY. THAT THAT PERSON WHO WAS A MINOR WAS NOT A MINOR THAN THAN. THAT'S ALL EXPECTED OF THEM BUT THAT IS NOT IN SECTION A. AND SO ARE. YOU KNOW IT AT THE VERY LEAST I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BUT AGAIN I REALLY WISH THAT YOU'D SEPARATED THE TWO BECAUSE. IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER FOR ME TO SUPPORT IT IF IF THIS WAS JUST SECTION BE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AND NOT SECTION NAY JUST BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE SECTION BE IS A LOT FURTHER ALONG. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN WILL LOOK INTO IT AND SEE SEE HOW ARE WE CAN APPROACH IT. THE REASON WHY WE. HAD PULLED A HIPPIE IN ONE BILL WAS BECAUSE I AYE WE THOUGHT THAT THE COMMON THREAD WAS THE CONSENT PIECE PARENTAL CONSENT SO. SO THAT'S WHAT TIED TO TWO PIECES TOGETHER ARE INDEED BOTH DON'T DEAL WITH A SOCIAL MEDIA OUR WEBSITES IN GENERAL SO WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR US TO DO. YOU KNOW BOTH CONCEPTS IN IN JUST ONE BILL. BUT WILL YOU DON'T LAW GO FORWARD TO WILL BE HAPPY TO KIND AYE RECONCILED THE YOU KNOW BOTH A AND B. AND AND SEE HOW WE CAN KIND. OF MAKE SENSE MAKE MORE SENSE. TO THE BILL AS WE GO ALONG THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE. SO I LIKE MR OBERNOLTE HIGH MASS MORE SYMPATHETIC TO THE SECOND PART OF THIS. A QUESTION ABOUT THAT ACTUALLY SO CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN HOW THE I UNDERSTAND IS THAT AGE VERIFICATION PROCESS FOR ALCOHOL PURCHASES ONLINE. THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS HOW DOES HOW DOES THAT WORK AND HOW IT WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE DIFFERENT ANYWAY. IT. ITS CHAIRMAN. AT HOWARD JEWELERS ETHICS INSTITUTE I'M SO THE AGE VERIFICATION THAT HAPPENS WITH ALCOHOL MOST COMMONLY HAPPENS NOT ONLY THROUGH THE INTERNET. BUT ALSO WHEN ALCOHOL WAS DELIVERED. THERE HAS TO BE SOMEBODY WHOSE IDEAS CHECK BEFORE THEY CAN SIGN FOR IT. IN THE WITNESSES SITUATION THE BOX WEAPONS FROM AMAZON SHOWED UP DESTRUCT. IT WAS ON YOUR DOORSTEP OF ARTICLE WHEN YOU CAME HOME FROM LUNCH SO THERE WAS NO REQUIREMENT. THAT ANYBODY WHO IS EVEN POTENTIALLY QUITE UPSIDE FOR BUT THAT'S. THE BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT. TO A LOT OF THE POINTS RAISED. CORRECTLY HERE IN THE COMMITTEE HEARING IT DOESN'T PRESCRIBE ANY PARTICULAR METHOD OF DOING SO BUT THAT'S THE WAY THAT AGE VERIFICATION IS HANDLED WOOD ALCOHOL IT IS NOT. CURRENT LAW IS CLEARLY INADEQUATE. TO THE. TO THE TASK OF REQUIRING SOMETHING EVEN REMOTELY COMPARABLE FOR FIREARMS OR OTHER ITEMS THEIR LEGAL ASSEMBLY CHILDREN YES EVERY OPPOSITION THAT WHAT WOULD BE THE THE PROBLEM WITH SUBJECTING THESE SINISTER LOOKING ITEMS. TO THE SAME. PROCESS AS WE CURRENTLY FROGHALL. WELL PART OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. TALKS ABOUT VERIFYING THE AGE OF THE PERSON PURCHASE ARE AT THE POINT OF SALE. SO RIGHT THERE THERE'S CHALLENGES OF HOUSE SOMEONE HOW A COMPANY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND I THINK A LOT OF THOSE CONCERNS WERE RAISED. WITH RESPECT TO THE THE DELIVERY AGAIN YOU KNOW. THIS CONCEPT WAS JUST PRESENTED TO US A FEW DAYS AGO AND AGAIN THIS IS TALKING ABOUT A HUGE CHANGE IN THE MARKETPLACE WE STILL NEED. TIME TO EXPLORE THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT. CHANGE. THERE ARE YOU KNOW THAT AS I SAID IN MY REMARKS. IF YOU HAVE A COPY LIKE WE NEED TO EXPLORE WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN IF YOU HAVE A COMPANY THAT HAS A POLICY OF WE DON'T. DELIVER THESE ITEMS TO SOMEBODY UNLESS THEY HAVE A SIGNATURE AND THEN YOU HAVE A DELIVERY COMPANY THAT DOES THAT ANYWAY. WHO'S GONNA BE LIABLE JUST THINGS LIKE THAT WE NEED TO SORT THROUGH AND AND FIGURE OUT AND ALTHOUGH. IN THE SITUATION I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON ALCOHOL REGULATION BUT IT'S I KNOW IT'S VERY HEAVILY REGULATED ALREADY. AND SO THEY ARE TO COME TO THE TABLE WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OVERSIGHT. AND THEY'VE ALREADY SPENT A LONG TIME FIGURING OUT HOW TO MAKE THOSE RULES WORK THIS IS KIND OF STARTING FROM SCRATCH INTO THAT NEEDS TO BE REFLECTED IN THIS BILL WITH RESPECT TO IF IF IT WEREN'T FOR DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION THAT SORT OF THING. LOTS OF THINGS WE NEED TO CONSIDER. OKAY WHAT DOES SEEM LIKE WE HAVE A PRETTY CLEAR PRECEDENT AND I WOULD HOPE THAT. WE CAN AT LEAST USE THAT AS A REFERENCE POINT FOR DEVELOPING THIS GOING FORWARD. NOT MY LAST WISHES ON PART EIGHT SO. THAT YOU KNOW I WAS INTO THE DISCUSSION AND IT KIND OF SEEMS TO ME LIKE GUY IF YOU'RE A PARENT YOU KNOW OF ALL THE THINGS YOU KID COULD GET IN TROUBLE DOING ONLINE LIKE. THE PROSPECT THAT A COMPENSATED THIRD PARTY WOULD TAKE SOME PHOTO SHARING FACEBOOK AND PUT IT IN AND OUT IS. SPRITE NOT THAT. HIGH ON THE LIST BUT YOU CLEARLY CAROLINE ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND SO I'M JUST KIND OF WONDERING WHAT IS THE. WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL WHAT'S THE HARM IN THE US THERE ARE THREE HARMS. IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER MISTER CHAIRMAN. THAT IN THE FIRST IS THAT IT DOES. SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION. ON MY ABILITY AS A PARENT. TO HAVE EVEN A PRAYER AT BEING ABLE TO MONITOR MY DAUGHTER'S BEHAVIOR. ONLINE. THE SECOND IN THIS IS QUITE IMPORTANT MY SON I JUST WENT THROUGH THE PAINFUL PROCESS OF HAVING MY SON. APPLY FOR AND GO TO COLLEGE. AT LEAST THAT HE PEACE DON'T FIND BY THE WAY I IT IF I'M MY WALLET THE LIGHTER. THAT UP TO THIRTY PERCENT OF COLLEGES NOW AS A PART OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS. EXAMINE APPLICATION FOR COLLEGE EXAMINE YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE. MY SON APPLIED TO TWENTY COLLEGES. RIGHT THAT MEANS TWENTY DIFFERENT GROUPS ARE LOOKING TO WHETHER NOT WHEN WHEN WE IF YOU MAY HAVE CLICKED LIKE ON A PARTICULAR PRODUCT. HE THAT BUT FACEBOOK IS ASKING PERMISSION TO DO IN THESE BOILERPLATE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF TAKE THAT LIKE. AND WITHOUT REAL KNOWLEDGE OF ANYBODY'S PARENT OR HIMSELF BROADCAST IT TO ALL OF HIS FRIENDS OR ANY PARTICULAR GROUP THAT HE MAY HAVE FOUND A BOX. SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. SOMETHING WHICH IS USING YOUR CHILD'S NAME OR FACE IN A WAY THAT POTENTIALLY COULD AFFECT COLLEGE BUT ALSO SIMPLY AFFECT THE REPUTATION AMONG THEIR PEER GROUP IT'S NOT THE WILL. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT THE TRIPS THROUGH THE OCEANS I GRANT YOU. BUT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT GIVEN BULLYING GIVEN COLLEGE IN GIVEN MY ABILITY IS THE PARENT TO TRY AND BE APPARENT IN THE TWENTY FIRST. I APPRECIATE THAT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT MOST OF THE HARM THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE EXTENT THERE IS HARM IS KIND OF INHERENT IN IN USING THE PLATFORM THEN. IN THAT YOU'RE MAKING DECISION YOURSELF TO RELEASED IMAGES OR INFORMATION INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN WHATEVER. EXTEND THAT IS AMPLIFIED WITH THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS IS GOING TO BE QUITE INFREQUENT AND. SHIP RATHER MINOR IN COMPARISON TO. THE EXPOSURE THAT'S INHERENT IN USING THE PLATFORM ITSELF SO IT KIND OF SEEMS TO ME LIKE. THE REMEDY BEING PROPOSED HERE IS A PRETTY AGGRESSIVE ONE FOR SOME IN THAT. YOU KNOW MAY NOT BE A HUGE PROBLEM BUT ALL AT HIS REYES DID YOU HAVE A A COMMENT I'VE. IT'S CLEAR FROM THE COMMENTS THAT. THERE ARE STILL SOME ISSUES. BUT ONE OF THE THE COMMENTS FROM THE OPPOSITION HOWEVER WAS ABOUT STRICT LIABILITY AND I KNOW. UM'S CHAO YOU'VE INDICATED THAT THERE IS NOT STRICT LIABILITY I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION WHAT IT IS YOU READ. THAT WOULD GIVE YOU THAT IMPRESSION LIKE I DID NOT SEE THAT EITHER IN THE BILL. THANK YOU ALL IN SO THAT. IT'S ACTUALLY EXACTLY WHAT MISTER A SOMEONE OBERNOLTE REFERENCE TO SECTION EIGHT IS NOT HAVE THE STANDARD THAT. THE PLATFORMS THE WEBSITES TAKE REASONABLE MEASURES. IT SIMPLY SAYS THEY HAVE TO DO IT PERIOD. THAT'S A STRICT LIABILITY SECOND SECTION SAYS WE STILL THESE ITEMS YOU HAVE TO DO IT. WAY. TEAM REGIONAL VERIFICATION. THAT IS NOT PRESENT IN THE SECOND SECTION IN THE FIRST SECTION AT ALL DESPITE THE WAY. MISTER HOWARD MAY HAVE REPRESENTED IT IS EXACTLY THE ISSUE THAT MISTER OBERNOLTE REFERENCED. THE TERM RESEMBLES NOT PRESIDENT SECTION AT ALL. NOW RESPECTFULLY STICK TO WHAT I SAID THAT IT IS STRICT LIABILITY. VERY GOOD THEM THE I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH WAS CHAU YOUR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO SPEAK WITH THE OPPOSITION. YOU'VE MADE THAT CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING AND. IT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED. BUT WE ALSO NEED FOR IT TO TO HAVE THE THE GREATER DETAIL THAT WILL BE NECESSARY WHEN WE VOTE ON THIS ONE. UP ON THE FLOOR. ATTACH. SHALL ANY CLOSING REMARKS I A I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY. WE HAVE A MOTION WE NEED A SECOND. THE MOTION IS A DO PASS MADAM SECRETARY. AS AMENDED MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SHALL HIGH HIGH KILEY NOT VOTING NOT VOTING. BAKER. I MARC BERMAN. I CALDERON. IRWIN. MORE. IRWIN I. MULLIN AYE AYE OBERNOLTE. NO REYES. AYE TEN. SIX. EXPERTS THE BILL IS OUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S SAY FOR. NEXT UP IS AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY FIVE THAT IS FILE ITEM NUMBER EIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN HOPEFULLY THIS WILL. DEAL SHORTER. AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY FIVE WOULD PROHIBIT THE OPERATOR OF A COMMERCIAL HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAM FROM INTENTIONALLY SHARING. WHAT IS CLOSING A CONSUMERS INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH MONITORING INFORMATION WITH A THIRD PARTY? WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING CONSUMERS ARE CONSENT. THESE ARE THE FITBIT DEVICES SO. THIS BILL THIS BILL IS TO PICK UP WHERE NEGOTIATION NOW SO LEFT OFF ON FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER RICH GORDON SABIL AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY EIGHT TELL FROM OUR TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN. AND ARM ARE. I AM HOPEFUL THAT THAT WITH THE INPUT OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS WE CAN CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION TO COME UP WITH A STRONG PROPOSAL THAT PROTECTS THE SENSITIVE. HEALTH DATA OF CONSUMERS. ARMED PROTECTION OF MEDICAL HEALTH INFORMATION ISN'T ESTABLISH RIGHT WITHIN OUR COUNTRY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. WE HAVE THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF NINETEEN NINETY SIX WAR HIPAA PLACES THAT WHICH PLACES STRICT. REQUIREMENTS ON THE SHARING OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION AND ALSO PROVIDES PROTECTION TO CONSUMERS BY GIVING THEM THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHO HAS ACCESS TO THEIR HEALTHCARE. ALL DATA IN CALIFORNIA WE ALSO HAVE THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL INFORMATION ACT OR CMI A TO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUAL AS MEDICAL INFORMATION FROM UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE. HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAMS HAVE INCREASED IN POPULARITY THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS SO THESE DEVICES ARE MOST COMMONLY WORN ON A CONSUMER'S RISK. OUR AND OUR CABLE LOW PERFORMING CONSIDERABLE HEALTH MONITORING INCLUDING THE TRACKING OF THE CONSUMERS HEART RATE. OF BLOOD GLUCOSE IN ALSO SLEEPING HABITS. ADDITIONALLY SOME ENCOURAGE USERS TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR MOODS AS WELL AS SO. SEXUAL BEHAVIOR YOU IN. WHILE HIPPO AND CMI A PROVIDE STRONG PROTECTIONS FOR MEDICAL HEALTH INFORMATION THERE IS NOT A SIMILARLY ROBUST FRAMEWORK OF PROTECTIONS FOR HEALTH DATA WHICH IS GENERATED. OUTSIDE OF THE MEDICAL SETTING. IN THIS VOID. COOPERATORS OF COMMERCIAL HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAMS ARE GENERALLY ABLE TO SHARE AND OR SELL THAT CONSUMERS ARE DATA TO THIRD PARTIES. WITH THAT IN MIND THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH THAT IN ORDER TO SHARE A CONSUMERS PERSONAL. IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH MONITORING INFORMATION AND OPERATOR OF A COMMERCIAL HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAM MUST FIRST OBTAIN A CONSUMER'S AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT THAT FULFILLS THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS ONE. THEIR REQUEST MUST BE SEPARATE FROM ALL OTHER AUTHORIZATIONS OR AGREEMENTS TO THE CONSENT. REQUEST MUST INCLUDE THE NAME OF THE THIRD PARTY AND THE REASON FOR THE REQUEST AND FINALLY IT MUST BE MADE CLEAR THAT. A CONSUMERS REFUSAL TO SHARE THE INFORMATION A WOULD NOT PROHIBIT OR LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO USE A COMMERCIAL HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAM. OFF FINALLY THE BILL WOULD PROVIDE A WAIVER OF ANY RIGHTS A PENALTY OR REMEDY A TO THE CONSUMER IN THE CONSENT IS UNENFORCEABLE AND ALSO AVOID AS A MATTER OF LAW. STILL OUT WITH THAT IDEA ASKED WE ARRIVAL. I ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MANTICORAN ON BEHALF OF BOTH PARTIES RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL YET HOWEVER. PREVIOUS ITERATIONS WITH OTHER AUTHORS WE'VE WORKED ON EXTENSIVELY IN RECENT YEARS AND AND LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THE OF DISSECTING AUTHOR PARTICULARLY AROUND. DEFINITIONS AND AND IMPLEMENTATION AND. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR EFFORTS ARE. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WHAT IS AN OPPOSITION? HELLO AGAIN SARAH BOOT ON BEHALF OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. OUR POSITION ON THIS BILL IS OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED I WE DO NOT OPPOSE THE CONCEPT OF THIS BILL THAT PEOPLE SENSITIVE HEALTH INFORMATION WITH THEIR HEART RATE MONITORING DATA. SHOULD HAVE HEIGHTENED PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AND FOR THAT REASON WE DO NOT OPPOSE THE REQUIREMENT. THAT HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAM SHOULD PROVIDE CLEAR AND CONSPICUOUS NOTICE TO CONSUMERS OF THEIR DATA COULD BE SHARED WHICH IS A HIGH STANDARD THAT REQUIRES NOTICE TO STAND OUT FROM THE SURROUNDING TAXED. WE ALSO DO NOT OPPOSE THE CONCEPT OF OPT IN AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT FOR THE SHARING OF THIS INFORMATION. THE CONCERNS WE HAVE THIS FOLDER TO BILL ARE TWOFOLD OUR FIRST INFORMATION COVERED BY THE BILL IS TOO BROADLY INTO VAGUELY DEFINED AS A CONSUMERS. MENTAL OR PHYSICAL CONDITION. THAT DEFINITION CAN COVER SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS AND IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR A COMPANY TO WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE. ON WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION INCLUDING THAT DEFINITION SECOND CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BILL PRESENT PRACTICAL CHALLENGES ARE JUST TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF THEM. THE REQUIREMENT OF SEPARATE. CONSENT COULD RESULT IN MULTIPLE CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION COMPETING FOR THEIR OWN SEPARATE CONSENT. ULTIMATELY LEADING TO USER COULD FATIGUE PRESENTING PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY. THE REQUIREMENT OF CONSENT FOR EVERY TYPE OF PROGRAM SHARES INFORMATION WITH A THIRD PARTY REGARDLESS OF THE REASON THAT PRESENTS PRACTICAL CHALLENGES AS WELL. AND COULD RESULT IN AN EVER CHANGING LISTA ENTITIES THAT WOULD NOT BE MEANINGFUL TO CONSUMERS AGAIN RESULTING POTENTIALLY IN USER FATIGUE. THEN THERE'S OTHER THINGS AS WELL BUT. I WANT TO KNOW THAT TO DATE WE HAVE ENGAGED IN A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE WITH THE AUTHOR AND PRESENTED THE AUTHOR OF THE SUBSTANTIVE SENT A PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT I'VE HIGHLIGHTED A COUPLE MORE. I DON'T WANT TO SUGAR COAT AND IMPLY THAT THERE'S NOT WORK TO DO TO REACH A PLACE OF AGREEMENT BUT THE DIVIDE IS NOT INSURMOUNTABLE HERE AND SO WE HOPE THAT THE AUTHOR WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH US AND MAKE THIS BILL WORKABLE. THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON NATASHA MINSKER FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA ARE CURRENT POSITION IS OPPOSING LESS AMENDED WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE GOAL OF THIS BILL AND ARE EAGER TO WORK WITH. THE AUTHOR TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LANGUAGES OF FINELY TUNED TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. CHRIS MCEWEN BEHALF OF THE COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WE SHARE THE CHAMBERS CONCERNS THANK YOU. LARA BENNETT WITH TECHNET TEN FOR THE LAST TIME TODAY AT LIKE US OSHITA COMMON SENTIMENTS WITH THOSE OF CAL CHAMBER THANK YOU VERY TIME. I FIELDING GRIEVES FOR THE ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION NOT OPPOSE JUST EXPRESSING SOME AYE CONCERNS AND I WANT TO SHARE AN UPDATE. FROM LAST WEEK SO THE VANCE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ADMITTED TRADITIONALLY. REPRESENTS THE THE MEDICAL DEVICES YOU THINK OF ALL TIME CLASS ONE TWO AND THREE MEDICAL DEVICES NOT YOUR. SORT OF COMMERCIAL DIGITAL HEALTH TECHNOLOGY INCREASINGLY WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT. DIGITAL HEALTH SECTOR THAT WE REPRESENT FOR THE HEALTH CARE SETTING AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DRAW MORE MORE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN HEALTH CARE SETTING AND. I THE COMMERCIAL SPACE BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO DO BECAUSE SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY SO NEW. WE DID WANT TO SHARE THAT AS OF LAST WEEK THE FDA HAS ANNOUNCED A NEW REGULATORY PROCEEDING. MOVING INTO THE SPACE IN ATTEMPTING TO REGULATE ALL DIGITAL HEALTH PRODUCTS TOM IRRESPECTIVE OF SETTING. LIKE THEY WOULD FOR MEDICAL DEVICES OUT WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE YET. THAT WAS LITERALLY JUST ANNOUNCE MIDDLE OF LAST WEEK AND SO THE VANCE MICHAEL TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATIONS ONE OF THE. TOP PLAYERS IT'S GONNA TRY TO WORK WITH THE FDA DID TO. IMPROVE THAT SITUATION IMPROVE THAT REGULATORY PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUT THAT. EVERYTHING IS REGULATED AS A SHOULD BE. BUT WE DID WANT TO SHARE THAT WILL CONTINUE REVIEW THAT LANGUAGE WERE REVIEWING THE BILL IN FRONT OF US FURTHER TO TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT THE IMPACTS WOULD BE. A IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT NEW FTE THAT FDA PROCEEDING. AND OF COURSE THAT WOULD ADD ANOTHER LAYER TO THE FDA FTC ENFORCEMENT ABILITY THAT'S THAT'S THERE TODAY. SO HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU ON A DEFINITIONAL CHANGES ARE TWO WEEKS DOWN THE ROAD AND THAT THE CALVARY LIFE SCIENCE ASSOCIATION ALSO SHARES. THAT CONCERN AS WELL THINK. THANK YOU BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE NOW I'M MISTER BERMAN. SO. IT'S LIKE DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN. OF. YEAH DEFTLY RIGHT JUST BECAUSE VERY NECESSARY NEEDED REGULATION AND. OVERLY BROAD AND VAGUE LANGUAGE. THAT THE OPPOSITION RIGHTFULLY AS CONCERNS ABOUT CAN YOU ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED. FROM THE OPPOSITION AND AND WHAT YOUR PLANS ARE TO. AMELIORATE THOSE MOVING FORWARD. UP WHAT THANK YOU AGAIN OF I THINK I WANNA. STATE THAT THIS IS STILL OING TO BE A WORK IN PROGRESS I THINK THERE'S. OF MUCH TO TO TO WORK ON AND. THE AYE IT BUT I'M I'M VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE OPPOSITION IS A HAS A. A PRESENTED THEIR SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT RIGHT NOW I THINK. WEARS BEFORE WE CAN HAVE YOU KNOW THEY SELL YOU IN AND AND CHAMBER NOW WE HAVE BOTH SITES SO SO IT TO GET THE YOU KNOW I THINK WE'RE WE'RE GOOD. BECAUSE WEWE COULD ACTUALLY NARROW THE SCOPE OF THE BILL TO SEE WHAT WHAT IS A WORKABLE SOLUTION. SO. AYE LOW FOR TO WORKING WITH BOTH SITES ARE AND ARE IN I'M COMMITTED TO DOING SO AS WELL AND AND AS FAR AS THE FDA. RULING THAT CAME DOWN AND I JUST BEEN HANDED A COPY OF THAT AS WELL AS WELL JUST FEW HOURS AGO. AND WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT AS WELL AS TO SEE WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING AND HOW WE COULD SPEAK OUT BILL TOO APPIAN LINE WITHOUT THE FDA IS DOING SO. YOU HAVE GOT COMMITMENT FROM ME. WE SHOULD THAT YEAH AND I'D APPRECIATE THE COMMITMENT TO TO WORK WITH WITH ALL PARTIES TO MAKE SURE THAT. THERE WE CAN ALL ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES OBJECTIVES. IN A WAY THAT'S THAT'S MANAGEABLE AND ALSO HOPEFUL FOR THE END USER. CAPS I THINK. MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR UP SO I AGAIN. IT'S REALLY MATTER HERE. ONCE A BILL GETS OUT IN THE WILD. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THE VERBIAGE EXACTLY RIGHT AND I SHARE SOME OF THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF WHAT EXACTLY IS. HEALTH INFORMATION. SO ADULT ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP WORKING ON THAT I I DO HAVE ONE. QUESTION FOR YOU. IN YOUR BILL AMONGST ALL OF THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT THAT IF. A CONSUMER OPTS OUT OF THE DISCLOSURE THEY CONTINUE TO BE ALLOW TO FULL USE OF THE. A OF THE HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAM. ALLEN I WONDER WHY YOU HAD INCLUDED THAT BECAUSE THEN IF YOU THINK ABOUT. ONE OR RUNNING APPLICATION. AND THE THE APPLICATION BECAUSE OF THE YEAR BILL IS EXPLICIT WITH ITS CONSUMERS ABOUT THE FACT THAT. WE ARE GOING TO USE YOUR INFORMATION TO SELL YOU LIFE INSURANCE BECAUSE IF YOU CAN RUN A SEVEN MINUTE MILE YOU'RE REALLY GOOD LIFE INSURANCE RISK IN THEIR PEOPLE THAT WANT TO COMPETE FOR YOUR BUSINESS. SO THEY'RE EXPLICIT ABOUT THAT SO. IF THE APPLICATION CLEARLY IS THE PRODUCT OF. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MAN HOURS OF TIME. MAIN THE THE APPLICATION CREATOR HAS A PROFIT MOTIVE FOR MAKING THAT. WHY IF THEY'RE EXPLICIT WITH CONSUMER SHOULDN'T THEY BE ALLOWED TO SAY LOOK IF YOU WANT TO USE US UNDER THOSE TERMS IT'S FINE? AND IF YOU DON'T THEN YOU HAVE TO PAY US FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT. YES I THINK YOU KNOW I I'M GONNA OPEN I MEAN AS FAR AS OFTEN RESOLVED OUR OTHERWISE I I THINK YOU KNOW A. THE THE INTENT IS TO. YOU KNOW. BASICALLY ALERT THE USER THAT THEY HOW OF OUR RIGHT. TO THEIR OWN DATA I MEAN I I THINK A SO. YOU KNOW SO THE DINNER SHOW YOU KNOW THAT THE THE IMPETUS FOR. FOR THE OPT OUT IS JUST THAT I MEAN I I THINK OUR. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A IS A STARTING POINT I MEAN I I THINK OUR. I'M OPEN TO ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS AS WELL I MEAN I I THINK UP GUYS PAUL YOU. THE VERY BASIC THAT RECONCILING OKAY I THINK THE BILL WOULD BE A LOT CLEANER NOW IF YOU DIDN'T GET INTO THAT WHOLE RELATIONSHIP AND JUST MERELY SAID. THAT THE. APPLICATION PROVIDER HAD TO BE TRANSPARENT WITH WHAT THEY WERE DOING. AND WHAT THE CONSUMER THEN MAKE THE DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT. THAT COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP WAS SATISFACTORY. BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOU'RE DELVING INTO A WHOLE DIFFERENT. ENVIRONMENT YET ALL DIFFERENT ISSUE WHEN WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR PART OF THE BILL. TECH DATA. TIFFANY MS BAKER. THANK YOU I'M I. ALMOST MISSED IT BUT I THINK IT'S THEIR. I BELIEVE YOU YOUR BILL CURRENTLY WAVES BINDING ARBITRATION. THAT I WANNA MAKE SURE WELL I MEAN THE WAY I READ IT IS PAGE FOUR LINES ELEVEN TO FOURTEEN. THAT WHY YEAH IT'S JUST OUT OF THE HEALTH CONSENT I MEAN IT'S JUST THERE. OF IT IT DOESN'T WAIVE ANY ANYTHING ELSE JUST THE CONSENT PIECE THAT IS SO PART OF PART OF THE. PART OF THE LANGUAGE OKAY BECAUSE THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN IN THE LANGUAGE GOING TO MISTER OBERNOLTE IS EXCELLENT POINT THAT LANGUAGE MATTERS IS. A WAIVER OF ANY LEGAL RIGHT PENALTY REMEDY. FORUM WHICH IS BINDING ARBITRATION OR ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE. PRESENTED TO THE CONSUMER IS UNENFORCEABLE AND VOID AS A MATTER OF LAW IN THIS PRE CLASSIC. GET RID OF BINDING ARBITRATION ON WHICH THE INTENT IS JUST TO HAVE THE LANGUAGE APPLY TO THEIR CONSENT BECAUSE NOT NOT YOU KNOW NOT IT ANYTHING ELSE. BUT I'LL BE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO IT TO SEE MAKE SURE THAT IT'S DOZEN YOU KNOW EXTEND BEYOND WHAT WE WANTED. YEAH I THINK YOU THAT THAT WAS MY QUESTION IS I DO THINK THAT IS AND. THAT IS THE AFFECT OF THE LANGUAGE AND APPRECIATE YOUR. WILLINGNESS TO LOOK AT THAT THANK YOU. ELSE. SEARCH OUT JUST BECAUSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK RAGLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.
