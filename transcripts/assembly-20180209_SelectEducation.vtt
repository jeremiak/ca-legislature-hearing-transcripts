00:12:39.825 --> 00:12:40.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

The intent of this hearing is to

00:12:49.802 --> 00:12:50.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
get a greater understanding of

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:52.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
the need for CT and workforce

ground. And businesses who need

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:59.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:01.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
This year I am proud to join the

00:13:01.881 --> 00:13:03.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
author AB seventeen forty three

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:05.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
which is a bipartisan coalition

00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:06.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of members to ensure that we

00:13:06.418 --> 00:13:08.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
continue funding. California's

00:13:08.187 --> 00:13:09.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
career technical and education

00:13:10.055 --> 00:13:12.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
incentive grant program at five

00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:14.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
hundred million every year for

00:13:14.093 --> 00:13:15.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
the next three years.

00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:16.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
We understand that these

00:13:16.395 --> 00:13:18.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
programs are more expensive so

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
we need to invest the adequate

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:21.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
funds of curriculum and tech

00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:24.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
techniques keep up as economy is

00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:26.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
changing so rapidly as you all

00:13:26.205 --> 00:13:27.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
know.

00:13:27.873 --> 00:13:28.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
We would be ill served if we

00:13:28.507 --> 00:13:30.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
created economy of those who

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:32.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
have access to good paying jobs

00:13:32.244 --> 00:13:33.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
and those who do not.

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:34.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
So we must ensure all

00:13:34.346 --> 00:13:35.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Californians have the

00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:36.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
opportunity gain the skills

00:13:36.615 --> 00:13:38.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
necessary to obtain a job that

00:13:38.217 --> 00:13:39.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
provides a economic certainty

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:42.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
and security for their families

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:42.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and we must support a strong and

00:13:42.788 --> 00:13:43.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
growing middle class.

00:13:43.889 --> 00:13:46.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

the Inland Empire in the

sixtieth assembly district

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:09.942 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
as a region in the Inland
Empire.

00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:12.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Our top industries I want to

00:15:12.177 --> 00:15:13.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
share with you are advance

00:15:13.979 --> 00:15:16.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
manufacturing global trade and

00:15:16.148 --> 00:15:18.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
logistics and the health care

00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:18.517 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
industry.

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:19.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
Within.

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:23.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Evolving world of technology

00:15:23.989 --> 00:15:24.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
information and communication

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
technology has been identified

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:28.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
as one of the key emerging

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:29.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
sectors of our time.

00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:31.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
The unemployment rate here in

00:15:32.064 --> 00:15:32.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the sixtieth assembly district

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:35.968 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
is out three point seven
percent.

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:36.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Slightly less than the overall

00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:37.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
state average

00:15:38.003 --> 00:15:40.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
so how do we continue to promote

00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:42.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
these middle to high skilled

00:15:42.408 --> 00:15:44.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
occupations and how do we

00:15:44.243 --> 00:15:46.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
continue to educate the

00:15:46.078 --> 00:15:48.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
necessary work force it takes.

00:15:48.213 --> 00:15:49.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
To meet our industry needs.

00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:52.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So hopefully we can get a little

00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:54.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
closer today and eh identifying

00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:56.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
some of this those solutions

00:15:56.188 --> 00:15:58.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
it's imperative that I recognize

00:15:58.324 --> 00:15:59.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

Turn Norco college into Aurora

00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:27.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
world renowned institution.

00:16:27.986 --> 00:16:30.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Yeah dot three so please feel

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:04.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
similar remarks.

00:17:04.723 --> 00:17:06.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I first of all I'd like to I

00:17:06.625 --> 00:17:06.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
think.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Everybody for coming in welcome

00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:10.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to the beautiful Norco college

00:17:10.362 --> 00:17:11.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
campus.

00:17:12.064 --> 00:17:12.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Were happy to hold these events

00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:14.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
into please that.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
You enjoy coming effort for

00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:16.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
these hearings I think it's a

00:17:17.002 --> 00:17:17.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
it's a win win for for both of

00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:18.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
us.

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:20.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
You know one of the things we

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:22.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
talk a lot about in in higher ed

00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:22.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
is this idea of building

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:26.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
pathways.

00:17:26.178 --> 00:17:27.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It's been a a very very strong

00:17:28.046 --> 00:17:28.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
conversation going on in the

00:17:28.647 --> 00:17:30.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
community colleges and in our

00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:32.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
unified school districts.

00:17:32.084 --> 00:17:34.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And when we think about building

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
pathways or trying to do is

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:38.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
create a very clear.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Pathway of instruction for

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:40.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
students so there so they

00:17:40.659 --> 00:17:42.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
understand exactly what courses

00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:44.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
they need to take.

00:17:44.096 --> 00:17:46.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Courses they don't need to take.

00:17:46.098 --> 00:17:48.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And provide all kinds of support

00:17:48.167 --> 00:17:48.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
around that pathway that helps

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:50.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
keep students

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:52.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
moving in a in a you know a

00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:54.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
productive direction.

00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:56.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
One of the big challenges in

00:17:56.074 --> 00:17:58.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
creating a successful pathway is

00:17:58.143 --> 00:17:58.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
getting to students to think

00:17:58.777 --> 00:18:00.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
early on.

00:18:00.112 --> 00:18:02.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
What the into that pathway looks

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:04.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
like

00:18:04.082 --> 00:18:04.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
and that's where?

00:18:04.516 --> 00:18:08.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Career education comes in.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:08.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
In my mind career education

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Creek technical education is not

00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:12.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
a program. It's a philosophical

00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:16.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
approach to to higher ed every

00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:16.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
single program that we offer on

00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:18.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
campus leads to some kind of

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:20.365 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
career to leading in some

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:20.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
direction.

00:18:20.732 --> 00:18:22.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
And it's.

00:18:22.334 --> 00:18:22.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
It's important that we get

00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:24.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
students to think about that I

00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:26.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
know I know are not all students

00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:27.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
are gonna know exactly what they

00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:28.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
want to do.

00:18:28.373 --> 00:18:30.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
You know I had.

00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:30.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
All kinds of crazy ideas when I

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:32.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
was you know eighteen nineteen

00:18:32.744 --> 00:18:33.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
twenty years old that type thing

00:18:33.412 --> 00:18:34.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
but getting them to think along

00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:36.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
the lines of where this.

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:38.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
This takes us is is really

00:18:38.283 --> 00:18:40.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
critical to our students having.

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:42.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
A successful and

00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:42.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
transformational experience

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
there a couple of things I'd

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:45.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
like to encourage you to think

00:18:45.157 --> 00:18:46.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
about and I know there be more

00:18:46.692 --> 00:18:48.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
details in the room.

00:18:48.293 --> 00:18:50.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
As we go through the hearing.

00:18:50.295 --> 00:18:52.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Up first of all the idea of

00:18:52.397 --> 00:18:54.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
guided pathways are I would like

00:18:54.366 --> 00:18:54.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
to encourage you to continue

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:56.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
funding that program it's

00:18:56.401 --> 00:18:58.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
something that the entire board

00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:58.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
believes is having had a direct

00:18:58.904 --> 00:19:00.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
impact.

00:19:00.205 --> 00:19:02.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
It's something that's all three

00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:04.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
colleges are working on it

00:19:04.176 --> 00:19:04.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
something that corona Norco

00:19:04.776 --> 00:19:06.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
unified Albert unified who rip

00:19:06.578 --> 00:19:08.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
of al unified they're all we're

00:19:08.347 --> 00:19:08.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
all trying to build. A these

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:10.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
pathways.

00:19:10.215 --> 00:19:12.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A second thing of like you know

00:19:12.484 --> 00:19:14.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
a can continue supporting and

00:19:14.253 --> 00:19:16.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
think about is to enrollment.

00:19:16.221 --> 00:19:16.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Are your colleagues in the

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:18.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
unified school district that

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
really thinking deliberately

00:19:20.192 --> 00:19:20.492 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
about programs.

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:24.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
That lead students into careers.

00:19:24.229 --> 00:19:24.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
The technical careers in in in a

00:19:24.897 --> 00:19:26.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
professional careers.

00:19:26.231 --> 00:19:28.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And they once I and I and I want

00:19:28.534 --> 00:19:30.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
to also build seamless pathways

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:32.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
that move from unified school

00:19:32.471 --> 00:19:34.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
districts into the community

00:19:34.206 --> 00:19:36.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
colleges and into jobs or into

00:19:36.308 --> 00:19:38.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the our community colleges and

00:19:38.277 --> 00:19:40.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Anna into the universities.

00:19:40.245 --> 00:19:42.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And this requires you know

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:42.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
unified school this of several

00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:44.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
bureaucracy and we have our own

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
bureaucracy in these of these

00:19:46.485 --> 00:19:48.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
have evolved over. Over decades

00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:50.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and they don't just you know

00:19:50.389 --> 00:19:52.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
sync up release.

00:19:52.257 --> 00:19:54.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
So we we have to be very

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:54.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
thoughtful about how we put

00:19:54.927 --> 00:19:56.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
these together so it's a a a

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:58.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
seamless experience for students

00:19:58.664 --> 00:20:00.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
in the requires. A a great deal

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:02.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
of time and energy and a little

00:20:02.568 --> 00:20:04.303 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
bit of funding.

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:04.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
But I just to give you a quick

00:20:05.003 --> 00:20:06.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
sense of how valuable these are

00:20:06.705 --> 00:20:08.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
we are we have a program here at

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:10.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
JFK where we have students in

00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:12.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
high school my transfer or they

00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:14.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
take college classes through

00:20:14.513 --> 00:20:16.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
dual enrollment. Bomb us last

00:20:16.415 --> 00:20:18.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
year we invested about two

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:18.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
hundred and fifty thousand

00:20:18.984 --> 00:20:22.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
dollars in taxpayer money to put

00:20:22.387 --> 00:20:22.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
that connection together.

00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:24.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And we saved families in the

00:20:24.556 --> 00:20:26.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
region about one point eight

00:20:26.358 --> 00:20:28.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
million dollars and educational

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:28.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
cost because of the.

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:30.495 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
The seamless are because we're

00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:30.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
able to offer this dual

involved in our work.

00:28:33.511 --> 00:28:34.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
That we all can I think

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:36.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
stipulate that while we have

00:28:37.015 --> 00:28:38.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
cortical full economy a full

00:28:38.917 --> 00:28:39.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
employment or near full

00:28:39.417 --> 00:28:41.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
employment we've got a whole lot

00:28:41.152 --> 00:28:41.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
of work to do.

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:43.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Until we can address the poverty

00:28:43.254 --> 00:28:44.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
issues in the income inequality

00:28:44.989 --> 00:28:46.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
issues in California and one of

00:28:46.925 --> 00:28:47.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
the roles of the summit is to

00:28:47.592 --> 00:28:48.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
build understanding and

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:49.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
awareness of how big that

00:28:49.427 --> 00:28:51.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
problem is what the dimensions

00:28:51.162 --> 00:28:52.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
are what we can do about it and

00:28:52.797 --> 00:28:53.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
so. Some of what we do is

00:28:53.364 --> 00:28:54.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
publish things like the

00:28:54.966 --> 00:28:56.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
California elevate California

00:28:56.801 --> 00:28:57.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
index and it helps keep all of

00:28:57.469 --> 00:28:59.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
us focused on just some of the

00:28:59.204 --> 00:29:00.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
issues. So let me just cite a

00:29:01.039 --> 00:29:02.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
couple of them of the items from

00:29:02.807 --> 00:29:03.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that index in nineteen seventy

00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:05.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
five when I was a junior in high

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:06.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
school twenty five percent of

00:29:06.878 --> 00:29:07.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the young men ages twenty five

00:29:07.545 --> 00:29:09.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
to thirty four. Got paid thirty

00:29:09.114 --> 00:29:10.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
thousand dollars or less.

00:29:10.849 --> 00:29:12.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Today holding those dollars

00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:15.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
constant forty one percent of

00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:16.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
men in that age group make

00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:18.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
thirty thousand dollars or less

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:20.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and seventy five dollars. That's

00:29:20.825 --> 00:29:21.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
a huge erosion of our middle

00:29:21.392 --> 00:29:22.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
class.

00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:24.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Five million Californians have

00:29:24.929 --> 00:29:25.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
minimum wage workers according

00:29:25.563 --> 00:29:27.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to the LA Joh and according to

00:29:27.198 --> 00:29:29.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the LA a thirty two percent of

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
those employers are the only.

00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:31.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Wage earner in their family they

00:29:31.569 --> 00:29:33.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
may be the only person in their

00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:35.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
family but and there that

00:29:35.106 --> 00:29:36.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
they're the only wage earner.

00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:37.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
And there seven hundred

00:29:37.375 --> 00:29:39.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
disconnected youth and the state

00:29:39.077 --> 00:29:40.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
of California sixteen to twenty

00:29:41.012 --> 00:29:41.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
four who are at school. Or

00:29:41.546 --> 00:29:42.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
employ.

00:29:42.881 --> 00:29:44.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I'm so we're not at full

00:29:45.016 --> 00:29:46.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
employment and we've got a big

00:29:46.851 --> 00:29:47.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
way to go if what we want to do

00:29:47.485 --> 00:29:48.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
is address these.

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:49.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
One of the things the summit is

00:29:49.521 --> 00:29:51.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
doing in this next year is

00:29:51.256 --> 00:29:53.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
trying to promote the idea of

00:29:53.091 --> 00:29:54.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
putting in state law.

00:29:54.893 --> 00:29:56.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
Metrics and targets for

00:29:56.928 --> 00:29:57.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
addressing these issues of

00:29:57.495 --> 00:29:57.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
income inequality in upper

00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
mobility.

00:29:58.897 --> 00:30:02.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
We've seen the power of the

00:30:02.934 --> 00:30:04.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
efforts to curb greenhouse gases

00:30:04.969 --> 00:30:05.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
in California where we set a

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
goal we set a target we unleash

00:30:07.372 --> 00:30:09.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
the power of the public and

00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:10.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
private sector to. To move

00:30:11.042 --> 00:30:12.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
toward that end and if we're

00:30:12.977 --> 00:30:13.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
serious and we are

00:30:13.378 --> 00:30:15.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
about addressing these issues we

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
should do the same for.

00:30:16.915 --> 00:30:18.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
For unemployment and we should

00:30:19.017 --> 00:30:19.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
do the same for income

00:30:19.517 --> 00:30:21.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
inequality would do should do

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:21.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
the same for reducing poverty

00:30:21.753 --> 00:30:23.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
and. Member Burke we look

00:30:23.254 --> 00:30:23.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
forward to working with you on

00:30:23.922 --> 00:30:26.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
the AB fifteen twenty task force

00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:27.492 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
denigrate some of those metrics

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:29.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and the good work that's already

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
under way to develop similar

00:30:30.895 --> 00:30:31.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
metrics for. Children and family

00:30:31.563 --> 00:30:32.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
and poverty.

00:30:32.931 --> 00:30:35.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And now that it's important for

00:30:35.233 --> 00:30:35.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
us to recognize even as we

00:30:35.833 --> 00:30:37.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
continue to focus on this

00:30:37.268 --> 00:30:38.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
imperative of workforce

00:30:38.937 --> 00:30:39.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
development that it's it's part

00:30:39.604 --> 00:30:41.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
of a system it is only one part

00:30:41.306 --> 00:30:43.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
the system that's gonna be

00:30:43.107 --> 00:30:43.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
necessary for those California's

00:30:43.775 --> 00:30:44.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
to reach those goals.

00:30:44.976 --> 00:30:45.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And if you look at the roadmap

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
for sure prosperity there's a

00:30:47.312 --> 00:30:47.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
lot and there are and what we

00:30:47.912 --> 00:30:49.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
need to do in order to build

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:49.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
houses a to build community

00:30:49.847 --> 00:30:51.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
development and in particular

00:30:51.249 --> 00:30:52.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
and housing.

00:30:52.984 --> 00:30:53.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
It should be noted that that the

00:30:53.685 --> 00:30:55.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
housing crisis is growing much

00:30:55.386 --> 00:30:56.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
faster than wages.

00:30:56.988 --> 00:30:58.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And Wilk in will continue to a

00:30:59.057 --> 00:30:59.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
road.

00:30:59.257 --> 00:31:01.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
The middle class economic

00:31:01.426 --> 00:31:03.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
security if if we don't do

00:31:03.194 --> 00:31:03.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
something about housing two

00:31:03.761 --> 00:31:05.296 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
years ago mackenzie on behalf of

00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:06.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
California for the summit did a

00:31:07.065 --> 00:31:07.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
study that showed that

00:31:07.565 --> 00:31:09.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
California's pay at least at

00:31:09.267 --> 00:31:11.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
least their low estimate fifty

00:31:11.069 --> 00:31:12.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
billion dollars a year more for

00:31:13.037 --> 00:31:13.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
housing than they should. And

00:31:13.671 --> 00:31:15.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
those are by low income families

00:31:15.173 --> 00:31:15.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and that money should be spent

00:31:15.807 --> 00:31:17.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
on education it should be spent

00:31:17.242 --> 00:31:18.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
on their own retirement it

00:31:18.943 --> 00:31:20.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
should be spent on other.

00:31:20.912 --> 00:31:21.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Necessities so you we have to

00:31:21.579 --> 00:31:22.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
remember the relationship

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:23.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
between what you're working on

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:25.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
today and all the other things

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:25.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
that you work so hard on

00:31:25.783 --> 00:31:26.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Sacramento when we do in the

00:31:26.351 --> 00:31:26.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
rear.

00:31:26.918 --> 00:31:29.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And there's also another thing

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
we need to focus on and that is

00:31:31.122 --> 00:31:31.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
that.

00:31:31.322 --> 00:31:32.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
By an estimate done for the

00:31:32.957 --> 00:31:33.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
summit by Stanford University

00:31:33.591 --> 00:31:35.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
were short nine hundred thousand

00:31:35.293 --> 00:31:37.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
median wage jobs if the metric

00:31:37.161 --> 00:31:39.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
was one median wage job for

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:41.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
every household. So we actually

00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:42.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
need to be worried about it

00:31:42.967 --> 00:31:43.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
thinking about what the business

00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:45.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
climate is and what the

00:31:45.136 --> 00:31:46.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
strategies are for growing the

00:31:47.005 --> 00:31:47.505 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
right kinds of jobs in our

00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:48.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
regions throughout the state.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:49.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Now finally the third part is

00:31:49.574 --> 00:31:51.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
this human development and

00:31:51.376 --> 00:31:52.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
workforce development has been a

00:31:53.044 --> 00:31:53.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
key element from the summit

00:31:53.611 --> 00:31:54.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
since day one.

00:31:55.046 --> 00:31:57.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
That our partners in the summit

00:31:57.282 --> 00:31:58.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Bammer have been very involved

00:31:59.017 --> 00:31:59.617 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
in the development of the strong

00:31:59.684 --> 00:32:01.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
workforce program where involved

00:32:01.185 --> 00:32:01.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
in the task force we did

00:32:01.719 --> 00:32:03.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
regional meetings. To help bring

00:32:03.454 --> 00:32:05.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
invoices from six from students

00:32:05.456 --> 00:32:07.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
from disadvantaged communities

00:32:07.358 --> 00:32:08.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
and from the employment

00:32:08.926 --> 00:32:09.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
community so that the

00:32:09.394 --> 00:32:10.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
recommendations that move

00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
forward to the governor in the

00:32:11.663 --> 00:32:13.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
legislature incorporated some of

00:32:13.331 --> 00:32:15.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
those voices we've been involved

00:32:15.199 --> 00:32:17.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
in directly. Implementing the

00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:17.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
strong workforce program not

00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:18.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
because it's an answer but

00:32:19.003 --> 00:32:20.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
because it's an example

00:32:20.938 --> 00:32:21.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
of how we can do it needs to get

00:32:21.639 --> 00:32:23.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
done to make best use of

00:32:23.241 --> 00:32:24.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
available resources.

00:32:24.976 --> 00:32:27.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
To get students from where they

00:32:27.145 --> 00:32:29.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
are to employment and what

00:32:29.113 --> 00:32:29.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
they've trained for on an upper

00:32:29.747 --> 00:32:30.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
mobility track.

00:32:30.982 --> 00:32:33.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
From the work over the last few

00:32:33.117 --> 00:32:33.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
years I think there's for

00:32:33.651 --> 00:32:35.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
lessons that we can draw that

00:32:35.253 --> 00:32:36.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
are part of our prescription

00:32:36.954 --> 00:32:37.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
going forward for all of our

00:32:37.555 --> 00:32:39.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
human development and workforce

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:41.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
development work.

00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:42.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
The first is we we absolutely

00:32:43.061 --> 00:32:43.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
need to continue to make

00:32:43.594 --> 00:32:45.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
progress in this alignment.

00:32:45.096 --> 00:32:47.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Between where students are and

00:32:47.198 --> 00:32:48.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
what skills they have and and

00:32:49.033 --> 00:32:49.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
and not just.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Classes but programs and

00:32:51.369 --> 00:32:52.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
curriculum that will prepare

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:53.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
them.

00:32:53.171 --> 00:32:55.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
For industry valued credentials

00:32:55.273 --> 00:32:55.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
and other industry valued

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
milestones that lead to

00:32:57.208 --> 00:32:59.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
employment.

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:00.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And in that there's still work

00:33:00.978 --> 00:33:01.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
to be done there and some of the

00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:03.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
topic in testimony today here is

00:33:03.414 --> 00:33:05.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
about how to get that align.

00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
The second is we just need to be

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:07.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ruthless about efficiency and

00:33:07.485 --> 00:33:09.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
this isn't from a business

00:33:09.187 --> 00:33:09.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
standpoint of squeezing out

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:11.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
every time. The reality is the

00:33:11.489 --> 00:33:13.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
faster students can move from

00:33:13.458 --> 00:33:15.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
where they are to that living

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
wage job. We're gonna save a lot

00:33:17.462 --> 00:33:19.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
of money and most of that money

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
is theirs

00:33:19.697 --> 00:33:21.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
most of that money is money that

00:33:21.399 --> 00:33:23.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that they lose because they are

00:33:23.201 --> 00:33:24.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
not employed in those jobs

00:33:25.036 --> 00:33:25.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
whether spending too long

00:33:25.603 --> 00:33:27.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
getting through that pipeline.

00:33:27.171 --> 00:33:29.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And so we have to continue to

00:33:29.207 --> 00:33:31.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
find ways about.

00:33:31.175 --> 00:33:33.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
How to accelerate that not so

00:33:33.211 --> 00:33:33.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that it is superficial so it's

00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:35.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
meaningful so get some where

00:33:35.413 --> 00:33:35.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
they have to be but we have to

00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:37.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
recognize that the cost of that

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:39.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
inefficiency is mostly born by

00:33:39.484 --> 00:33:41.119 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the young people in a better
job?

00:33:41.185 --> 00:33:43.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A third is we need to redefine

00:33:43.321 --> 00:33:45.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
access we are proud and we

00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:45.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
should be proud in the state of

00:33:45.957 --> 00:33:47.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
California for defining open

00:33:47.425 --> 00:33:49.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
access particularly community

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
colleges. Around fees and and

00:33:51.195 --> 00:33:53.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
the ability to get and the

00:33:53.164 --> 00:33:53.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ability to keep taking classes

00:33:53.831 --> 00:33:55.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
are to start and stop I'm a

00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:57.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
product of that system I have in

00:33:57.235 --> 00:33:57.769 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
a from a community college.

00:33:57.835 --> 00:33:59.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
But it's about much more than

00:33:59.637 --> 00:34:01.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that because access now is not

00:34:01.406 --> 00:34:03.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
just about getting in the door

00:34:03.441 --> 00:34:03.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
not being fees it's about

00:34:04.008 --> 00:34:05.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
offering what's needed when it's

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:07.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
needed and where it's needed.

00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:09.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
And we need to embrace a

00:34:09.313 --> 00:34:11.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
variety of ways to do that

00:34:11.082 --> 00:34:11.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
including technologies that are

00:34:11.749 --> 00:34:13.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
not only going to allow us to.

00:34:13.418 --> 00:34:15.253 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Do things like on offer online

00:34:15.319 --> 00:34:17.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
classes but offer a but to

00:34:17.255 --> 00:34:19.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
infuse faster competency based

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
classes and a start and and and

00:34:21.292 --> 00:34:23.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
then the link up especially with

00:34:23.094 --> 00:34:23.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
employers and this is another

00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:25.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
part of your. Somatic element

00:34:25.496 --> 00:34:27.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
today so.

00:34:27.131 --> 00:34:27.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
It's really clear not only

00:34:27.732 --> 00:34:29.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
today but especially going

00:34:29.467 --> 00:34:31.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
forward.

00:34:31.135 --> 00:34:31.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
That we're gonna have to find a

00:34:31.803 --> 00:34:33.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
way to double down and build

00:34:33.504 --> 00:34:35.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
even deeper.

00:34:35.273 --> 00:34:37.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Employer educational

00:34:37.108 --> 00:34:39.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
partnerships going forward

00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:41.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
McKenzie did another study last

00:34:41.212 --> 00:34:41.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
year not for the summit that

00:34:41.813 --> 00:34:43.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
just as useful that says and by

00:34:43.648 --> 00:34:45.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
twenty thirty fifteen percent of

00:34:45.316 --> 00:34:47.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the jobs will be replaced or

00:34:47.185 --> 00:34:49.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
obsolete because of machine

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:49.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
learning or automation

00:34:49.587 --> 00:34:51.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
artificial intelligence fifteen

00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:53.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
percent of the jobs.

00:34:53.157 --> 00:34:53.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So we're faced with this dilemma

00:34:53.791 --> 00:34:55.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that right now we've got a whole

00:34:55.493 --> 00:34:55.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
lot of people that need the

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:56.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
skills in order to get better

00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:59.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
jobs.

00:34:59.163 --> 00:35:01.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
And at the same time were

00:35:01.132 --> 00:35:01.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
worried about what those jobs

00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:03.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
but with which jobs are gonna

00:35:03.301 --> 00:35:03.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
disappear and what we need to do

00:35:03.968 --> 00:35:05.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
to prepare those people for it.

00:35:05.169 --> 00:35:07.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
We don't know the answers to all

00:35:07.405 --> 00:35:09.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of those questions but we do

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:09.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
know we can build an

00:35:09.607 --> 00:35:11.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
infrastructure. That allows for

00:35:11.442 --> 00:35:13.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
greater access greater

00:35:13.277 --> 00:35:15.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
efficiency greater adaptability

00:35:15.379 --> 00:35:17.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
and working with partnerships

00:35:17.148 --> 00:35:17.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
with employers to understand

00:35:17.715 --> 00:35:19.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
where those dislocation changes

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:21.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
are gonna happen before the pink

00:35:21.319 --> 00:35:21.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
slips come out and people can

00:35:21.953 --> 00:35:23.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
get para to take those jobs.

00:35:23.187 --> 00:35:25.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
One final word.

00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:27.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And this comes back to another

00:35:27.158 --> 00:35:27.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
thread this come through the

00:35:27.758 --> 00:35:29.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
summit from mark Bassano the

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
former executive officer of the

00:35:31.229 --> 00:35:31.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
southern California association

00:35:31.863 --> 00:35:33.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
a governor of. Governments now

00:35:33.464 --> 00:35:35.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
USCS a longtime member the

00:35:35.533 --> 00:35:37.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
summit network recently wrote a

00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:37.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
book and much after it says no

00:35:37.935 --> 00:35:39.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
once disposable.

00:35:39.203 --> 00:35:41.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Because of the demographic

00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:43.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
trends become because all of us

00:35:43.241 --> 00:35:43.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
baby boomers are going to retire

00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:45.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
and in the work force behind us

00:35:45.643 --> 00:35:47.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
isn't as large. And we actually

00:35:47.612 --> 00:35:49.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
gonna need everybody engaged and

00:35:49.547 --> 00:35:51.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
in our economy if we want our

00:35:51.449 --> 00:35:53.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
economy to grow and we want to

00:35:53.384 --> 00:35:53.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
meet the basic workforce needs

00:35:53.985 --> 00:35:55.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
it's not just about skills it's

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
about the skills for everybody

00:35:57.188 --> 00:35:57.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
who's in that workforce. As I

00:35:57.822 --> 00:35:59.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
mentioned we've got seven

00:35:59.357 --> 00:35:59.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
hundred thousand disconnected

00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:01.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
you we've also got five hundred

00:36:01.692 --> 00:36:03.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
thousand mostly men but men and

00:36:03.594 --> 00:36:05.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
women who are in our criminal

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:07.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
justice system in prison in jail

00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:09.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
on probation or parole. There

00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:09.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
are hundreds of thousands of

00:36:09.934 --> 00:36:11.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
others that are formally

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:13.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
incarcerated not on the systems

00:36:13.471 --> 00:36:13.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
but still face barriers to

00:36:14.038 --> 00:36:15.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
employment. Those are examples

00:36:15.573 --> 00:36:17.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
about how we have to find

00:36:17.441 --> 00:36:18.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
everybody in our community and

00:36:18.075 --> 00:36:19.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
create a pathway the president

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
re said to get them into full

00:36:21.712 --> 00:36:23.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
employment that's our challenge

00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:25.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I think we're up to it thank you

00:36:25.216 --> 00:36:25.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
for the opportunity to give you

Now.

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:15.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Given your position on this

00:37:15.933 --> 00:37:17.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
committee your.

00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:19.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Probably as familiar more

00:37:19.637 --> 00:37:21.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
familiar than I am of the work

00:37:21.505 --> 00:37:23.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
force challenges but I want to.

00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:23.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Put it in the context of an. Of

00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:25.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
an employer.

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:27.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A and what what employers are

00:37:27.745 --> 00:37:29.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
are facing and all of a quote

economics in he said very well

00:37:34.151 --> 00:37:35.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
he said with the stated full

00:37:35.753 --> 00:37:37.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
employment.

00:37:37.355 --> 00:37:39.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Our and your your you mention

00:37:39.457 --> 00:37:39.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
your district being a three

00:37:40.024 --> 00:37:41.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
point seven percent. Of

00:37:41.392 --> 00:37:43.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
unemployment.

00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:45.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A job growth in general economic

00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:45.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
gains will largely be

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:47.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
constrained by the availability

00:37:47.698 --> 00:37:49.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
of of workers

00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:49.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
is is good for workers who might

00:37:49.967 --> 00:37:51.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
achieve.

00:37:51.369 --> 00:37:53.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Pay increases in the coming

00:37:53.571 --> 00:37:54.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
months supporters but poses a

00:37:54.171 --> 00:37:55.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
challenge for firms for

00:37:55.573 --> 00:37:57.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
businesses that want to grow but

00:37:57.708 --> 00:37:59.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
cannot.

00:37:59.377 --> 00:37:59.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Because they're unable to hire

00:38:00.011 --> 00:38:01.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
the necessary workers.

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:03.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Data at the national level

00:38:03.614 --> 00:38:05.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
indicates the job openings in

00:38:05.416 --> 00:38:05.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
general have reached historic

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:09.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
highs is holds true for most

00:38:09.353 --> 00:38:09.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
industries whether they're high

00:38:09.987 --> 00:38:11.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
school.

00:38:11.389 --> 00:38:11.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
A low skilled.

00:38:11.756 --> 00:38:15.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Manufacturing of those services.

00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:19.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
Of. Its it so prevalent

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:20.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
throughout the condom history

00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:21.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
hearing California nationally

00:38:21.565 --> 00:38:23.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
fifty percent of open available

00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:25.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
positions in this country. Go

00:38:25.436 --> 00:38:27.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
unfilled.

00:38:27.405 --> 00:38:28.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Because candidates are available

00:38:28.072 --> 00:38:29.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
at the same time forty percent

00:38:29.707 --> 00:38:31.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
of businesses can't take on more

00:38:31.742 --> 00:38:33.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
work because they can't fill the

00:38:33.544 --> 00:38:34.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
jobs that they need to do the

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:35.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
work.

00:38:35.413 --> 00:38:37.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
So we've got a real mismatch.

00:38:37.448 --> 00:38:39.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Between our talent needs in the

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:41.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
pipeline of new and potential

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:42.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
workers in this this gets into

00:38:42.086 --> 00:38:43.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
what Jim was talking about with

00:38:43.888 --> 00:38:45.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
the retirement.

00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:49.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Of the baby boom generation of.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Our population cohorts coming in

00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:51.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
behind them were.

00:38:51.862 --> 00:38:53.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
You know we don't have the

00:38:53.898 --> 00:38:55.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
robust immigration we've had in

00:38:55.666 --> 00:38:57.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the in the past is a whole lot

00:38:57.501 --> 00:38:58.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
of things that enter into this

00:38:58.102 --> 00:38:59.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
but.

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:00.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
You still result with the same

00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:01.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
problem.

00:39:01.472 --> 00:39:03.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Of low unemployment but.

00:39:03.474 --> 00:39:03.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
The.

00:39:03.674 --> 00:39:05.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Less of an opportunity for

00:39:05.943 --> 00:39:07.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
businesses and the economy to

00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:09.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
grow so we've out what the six

00:39:09.747 --> 00:39:11.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
seventh eighth largest economy

00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:13.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
in the world.

00:39:13.484 --> 00:39:14.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
But we need to have a produce

00:39:14.085 --> 00:39:15.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
another.

00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:17.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Of what one point one million

00:39:17.588 --> 00:39:19.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
jobs of of a.

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
College degrees

00:39:21.459 --> 00:39:22.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
of three twenty thirty in order

00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:25.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
to keep that economy.

00:39:25.496 --> 00:39:27.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Does that economy going out and

00:39:27.531 --> 00:39:29.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
the reality is even.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
For this for for the students

00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:33.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
it is Saddam.

00:39:33.504 --> 00:39:35.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
How is difficult and that's real

00:39:35.973 --> 00:39:37.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
also ran into a mismatch only

00:39:37.575 --> 00:39:39.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
forty percent of the state's?

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:40.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Two point two million young

00:39:40.077 --> 00:39:41.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
adults that so.

00:39:41.512 --> 00:39:43.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Through a about age thirty.

00:39:43.848 --> 00:39:45.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Holden associates degree or

00:39:45.883 --> 00:39:47.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
higher in many lack the skills

00:39:47.952 --> 00:39:49.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
for for success it's even worse

00:39:49.987 --> 00:39:51.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
for underrepresented students

00:39:51.655 --> 00:39:53.457 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
less than ten percent.

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:55.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Of low income adults.

00:39:55.526 --> 00:39:59.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Or the post secondary degree.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:00.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
And you've got similar gaps

00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:01.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
entertainment for.

00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:03.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Of students of color in the

00:40:03.801 --> 00:40:05.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
state where fifty five percent.

00:40:05.536 --> 00:40:07.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A public school students are

00:40:07.838 --> 00:40:08.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
from low income families sixty

00:40:08.472 --> 00:40:09.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
percent.

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Students of color.

00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:13.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
The educational and career

00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:13.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
outcomes

00:40:13.944 --> 00:40:15.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
are inextricably linked to the

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
economy and vice versa were all

00:40:17.882 --> 00:40:19.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
in this together.

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:21.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
So.

00:40:21.552 --> 00:40:23.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Would we want to do about.

00:40:23.554 --> 00:40:25.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
There's lots of strategies in

00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:27.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
her about a lot of today the one

00:40:27.658 --> 00:40:28.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
that I want to.

00:40:28.125 --> 00:40:29.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
Plug in particular.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
As called link learning and you

00:40:32.029 --> 00:40:33.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
may you may have you may have

00:40:33.764 --> 00:40:35.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
heard of this I know that.

00:40:35.566 --> 00:40:36.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Some schools in your districts

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:37.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
of.

00:40:37.568 --> 00:40:39.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Bob are linked learning schools

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:41.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
are about a hundred districts

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:42.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
statewide the do it but I want

00:40:42.306 --> 00:40:43.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
to. Just go into a little bit

00:40:44.008 --> 00:40:47.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
and tell you why we like.

00:40:47.678 --> 00:40:49.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Ugh that we think that it has

00:40:49.647 --> 00:40:51.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the best prospect for providing

00:40:51.649 --> 00:40:53.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
a long term pipeline of well

00:40:53.651 --> 00:40:54.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
qualified students will meet the

00:40:54.351 --> 00:40:55.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
needs of. That the needs of

00:40:55.986 --> 00:40:57.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
employers and of the economy.

00:40:58.022 --> 00:41:01.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
And enabling these.

00:41:01.692 --> 00:41:02.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
High school graduates college

00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:03.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
grads to stay in Californian

00:41:03.928 --> 00:41:05.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
jobs.

00:41:05.696 --> 00:41:07.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Pay well and it of god the

00:41:07.798 --> 00:41:11.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
prospect for upward mobility.

00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:12.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Basic philosophy behind link

00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:13.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
learning.

00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:15.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Is the idea the students work

00:41:16.006 --> 00:41:17.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
harder and dream Baker.

00:41:17.608 --> 00:41:18.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
If there education is relevant

00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:21.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
to them.

00:41:21.612 --> 00:41:23.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
The approach integrates rigorous

00:41:23.747 --> 00:41:25.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
academics the beach meet college

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:26.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
ready standards.

00:41:26.217 --> 00:41:27.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Sequenced high quality career

00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:29.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
technical education work based

00:41:29.987 --> 00:41:31.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
learning.

00:41:31.655 --> 00:41:33.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And the supporting environment

00:41:33.824 --> 00:41:35.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
help students stay on track so.

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:36.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Four components rigorous

00:41:36.193 --> 00:41:37.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
academics.

00:41:37.661 --> 00:41:39.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Career technical education work

00:41:40.064 --> 00:41:42.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
based learning comprehensive

00:41:42.132 --> 00:41:44.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
support services so why focus on

00:41:44.101 --> 00:41:45.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
both.

00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:47.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Career in college we hear a lot

00:41:48.005 --> 00:41:48.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
about well. You know as a but

00:41:48.606 --> 00:41:49.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
just

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
there's a whole bunch of jobs a

00:41:51.909 --> 00:41:53.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
don't need a four year college

00:41:53.744 --> 00:41:55.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
education a. Whole bunch of.

00:41:55.679 --> 00:41:58.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Students who don't go to college

00:41:58.115 --> 00:41:59.617 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
why don't why should we focus
on.

00:41:59.683 --> 00:42:01.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Being college ready well.

00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:03.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Couple reasons one is the

00:42:03.721 --> 00:42:04.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
probability of making a living

00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:05.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
wage.

00:42:05.689 --> 00:42:06.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
In our economy special in

00:42:06.223 --> 00:42:07.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
California.

00:42:07.691 --> 00:42:09.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Without some form of post

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
secondary education is low and

00:42:11.862 --> 00:42:13.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
it's only gonna diminish.

00:42:13.697 --> 00:42:15.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Increasingly career success

00:42:15.933 --> 00:42:17.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
depends on some kind of a post

00:42:18.035 --> 00:42:19.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
secondary degree your credential

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:20.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
whether it's a certificate and

00:42:20.604 --> 00:42:23.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
apprenticeship.

00:42:23.707 --> 00:42:24.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
On associates degree though

00:42:24.308 --> 00:42:25.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
those are all things that are

00:42:25.976 --> 00:42:27.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
provide right here at at at

00:42:27.778 --> 00:42:29.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Norco. Or.

00:42:29.713 --> 00:42:30.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
About shoes degree or or or

00:42:30.314 --> 00:42:31.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
something higher.

00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:33.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
Secondly.

00:42:33.717 --> 00:42:35.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Without an explicit goal.

00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:37.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
For preparing high school

00:42:37.888 --> 00:42:39.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
students for a full range

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:41.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
post graduation opportunities.

00:42:41.625 --> 00:42:43.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
You risk.

00:42:43.727 --> 00:42:47.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Reverting to tracking students.

00:42:47.731 --> 00:42:48.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Tracking students entered into

00:42:48.365 --> 00:42:51.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
choices that an adult thinks.

00:42:51.735 --> 00:42:53.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Is right for that student and

00:42:53.671 --> 00:42:54.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
an adult may decide whether a

00:42:54.271 --> 00:42:55.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
student is ready for college and

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:56.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
we just want to go back there

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
thing that's.

00:42:57.641 --> 00:42:59.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
That's a.

00:42:59.643 --> 00:43:01.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
That's a placer we we we don't

00:43:02.012 --> 00:43:02.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
want to return to.

00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:03.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
So in addition a rigorous

00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:05.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
academics each pathway centers

00:43:05.749 --> 00:43:07.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
on increase student proficiency

00:43:07.618 --> 00:43:07.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
in areas such as.

00:43:08.018 --> 00:43:09.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Critical thinking problem

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
solving.

00:43:11.655 --> 00:43:13.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Information literacy

00:43:13.624 --> 00:43:14.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
collaboration these of the soft

00:43:14.258 --> 00:43:15.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
skills you hear about the boy

00:43:15.859 --> 00:43:16.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
would be to say they are really

00:43:16.493 --> 00:43:17.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
really important.

00:43:17.661 --> 00:43:19.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Once you get into the once again

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:21.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
of the work place.

00:43:21.665 --> 00:43:23.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Not speaking of workplace accord

00:43:23.634 --> 00:43:25.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
part of.

00:43:25.669 --> 00:43:27.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
The learning experience and

00:43:27.638 --> 00:43:28.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Winkler inning is work based

00:43:28.238 --> 00:43:29.606 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
learning.

00:43:29.673 --> 00:43:31.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
This is where.

00:43:31.675 --> 00:43:32.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Students can apply their

00:43:32.176 --> 00:43:33.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
classroom learning.

00:43:33.677 --> 00:43:35.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
In a professional setting and

00:43:35.846 --> 00:43:37.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
gain the real world experience

00:43:37.848 --> 00:43:39.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
in the process they learn what

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:40.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
it takes to being in the

00:43:40.284 --> 00:43:41.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
professional world.

00:43:41.685 --> 00:43:43.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:43:43.687 --> 00:43:45.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And they learn how to interact

00:43:45.923 --> 00:43:46.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
with people.

00:43:46.256 --> 00:43:47.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
On the job the other not

00:43:48.025 --> 00:43:49.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
necessarily working these can be

00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:51.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
job shadowing mentor ships.

00:43:51.929 --> 00:43:53.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:43:53.697 --> 00:43:55.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
Speakers.

internships.

00:43:59.703 --> 00:44:02.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Are but it's all part of a of a

00:44:02.206 --> 00:44:03.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
vote.

00:44:03.707 --> 00:44:05.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Link learning experience the

00:44:05.943 --> 00:44:07.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
become more engaged excited

00:44:07.678 --> 00:44:09.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
about their education.

00:44:09.713 --> 00:44:11.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
And they can.

00:44:11.715 --> 00:44:12.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Really answer and an intuitive

00:44:12.316 --> 00:44:15.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
level.

00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:16.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Why do I need to learn what it

00:44:16.353 --> 00:44:17.654 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
is I'm learning in the
classroom?

00:44:17.721 --> 00:44:19.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
So what's our role in this.

00:44:19.723 --> 00:44:21.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
A. There's.

00:44:21.725 --> 00:44:23.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
Unfortunately.

00:44:23.727 --> 00:44:27.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:44:27.731 --> 00:44:28.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
In under engagement by

00:44:28.232 --> 00:44:29.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
California employers in

00:44:29.933 --> 00:44:31.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
providing workplace experiences

00:44:31.702 --> 00:44:33.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
for youth despite the really

00:44:33.704 --> 00:44:34.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
strong business case for.

00:44:34.238 --> 00:44:36.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Of for making this happen it's a

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
lot easier.

00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:39.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
To grow work.

00:44:39.743 --> 00:44:41.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
That is becoming familiar with

00:44:41.979 --> 00:44:43.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
you rather than going out trying

00:44:43.847 --> 00:44:44.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to recruit it specially across

00:44:44.448 --> 00:44:45.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
state lines.

00:44:45.749 --> 00:44:48.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
US so we are of working with

00:44:48.085 --> 00:44:49.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
link learning alliance.

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

based learning models at their

00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:06.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
employers are. Can use of we've

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:07.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
been doing this for the last

00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:08.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
several years. This year on

please to say that were. Just

00:45:10.174 --> 00:45:12.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
starting up a new network with a

six local chambers of commerce

00:45:13.977 --> 00:45:15.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
that are involved in this.

00:49:28.832 --> 00:49:30.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
and tell consortium is one of

00:49:30.567 --> 00:49:32.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
the programs. That were a

00:49:32.302 --> 00:49:34.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
partner and.

00:49:34.104 --> 00:49:36.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
There are five colleges that

00:49:36.206 --> 00:49:36.606 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
partner with us six

00:49:36.673 --> 00:49:38.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
intermediaries for of those

00:49:38.308 --> 00:49:38.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
intermediaries our work for

00:49:38.875 --> 00:49:40.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
sports.

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:42.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Fourteen school districts

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:44.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
it's for engineering and

00:49:44.147 --> 00:49:46.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
manufacturing that's what the

00:49:46.383 --> 00:49:46.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
school districts are centering

00:49:46.983 --> 00:49:50.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
on and that's what we're doing

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:50.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
linking them in link learning

00:49:50.754 --> 00:49:52.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
linking them to opportunity so

00:49:52.456 --> 00:49:54.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
that they can succeed.

00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:56.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
One program which is a great

00:49:56.426 --> 00:49:58.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
example of a partnership.

00:49:58.161 --> 00:50:00.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Would be our slingshot nursing

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:02.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
program we brought all of our

00:50:02.466 --> 00:50:04.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
hospitals into one room and we

00:50:04.368 --> 00:50:06.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
said what do you need what can

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:08.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
we do to help you. They said we

00:50:08.472 --> 00:50:10.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
need case coordinators case

00:50:10.474 --> 00:50:12.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
managers is various names for it

00:50:12.576 --> 00:50:14.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
they said that's what's going to

00:50:14.311 --> 00:50:14.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
be the demand in the next five

00:50:14.945 --> 00:50:16.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
years.

00:50:16.179 --> 00:50:18.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So that's what we did we brought

00:50:18.415 --> 00:50:20.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
the community colleges and we

00:50:20.283 --> 00:50:22.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
said we need a curriculum

00:50:22.152 --> 00:50:24.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
curriculums been developed. But

00:50:24.154 --> 00:50:24.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
a million dollars the state

00:50:24.721 --> 00:50:26.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
provided order provide this and

00:50:26.556 --> 00:50:28.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
starting this month.

00:50:28.191 --> 00:50:30.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
The first group of case

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:30.627 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
coordinators are gonna be

00:50:30.694 --> 00:50:32.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
trained through our.

00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:34.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Community colleges primarily and

00:50:34.564 --> 00:50:36.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
we're going to have.

00:50:36.199 --> 00:50:38.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Incumbent workers getting

00:50:38.435 --> 00:50:40.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
retrained and upgraded to.

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:42.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Supplement their nursing skills

00:50:42.439 --> 00:50:44.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
would case coordination

00:50:44.174 --> 00:50:44.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
individuals coming out of

00:50:44.741 --> 00:50:46.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
college getting this starting

00:50:46.576 --> 00:50:48.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
this month we're really proud of

00:50:48.578 --> 00:50:50.213 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that initiative took about three

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:50.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
years to get going wouldn't of

00:50:50.947 --> 00:50:52.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
happened without the businesses

00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:54.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
in the room. Telling us what

00:50:54.484 --> 00:50:56.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
they need.

00:50:56.219 --> 00:50:56.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
We have another program locally

00:50:56.853 --> 00:50:58.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
called Errol flex Affleck's

00:50:58.555 --> 00:51:00.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
program couldn't be more proud

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:02.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
of this program.

00:51:02.225 --> 00:51:04.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
It is it started out as a pre

00:51:04.361 --> 00:51:06.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
apprenticeship era era flicks

00:51:06.196 --> 00:51:08.165 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
program for engineering
students.

00:51:08.231 --> 00:51:10.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
And putting them in.

00:51:10.267 --> 00:51:10.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Various aerospace companies

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:12.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
learning.

00:51:12.302 --> 00:51:14.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
How to be an engineer what they

00:51:14.604 --> 00:51:16.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
want to do go to college keep a

00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:18.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
end clued in their education so

00:51:18.708 --> 00:51:20.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
that they can? Of become

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:22.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
successful last week we were

00:51:22.446 --> 00:51:22.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
notified by the federal

00:51:22.946 --> 00:51:24.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
department of labor.

00:51:24.314 --> 00:51:26.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
That we were granted.

00:51:26.249 --> 00:51:28.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
Status as the first

00:51:28.385 --> 00:51:30.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
apprenticeship program

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:30.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
for and aerospace engineers in

00:51:30.854 --> 00:51:32.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
the country

00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:34.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
so that's an out growth of this

00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:36.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
pre apprenticeship program.

00:51:36.159 --> 00:51:38.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Real.

00:51:38.161 --> 00:51:40.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Real happy about that so we're

00:51:40.297 --> 00:51:42.098 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
gonna be taking high school
kids.

00:51:42.165 --> 00:51:42.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Community college individuals

00:51:42.766 --> 00:51:44.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
college individuals incumbent

00:51:44.501 --> 00:51:46.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
workers and making sure that

00:51:46.536 --> 00:51:48.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
they succeeded increase their

00:51:48.405 --> 00:51:48.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
potential.

00:51:48.705 --> 00:51:50.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
That's what boards.

00:51:50.173 --> 00:51:52.609 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Do many of them doing should do

00:51:52.676 --> 00:51:54.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
is be the glue we don't teach

00:51:54.644 --> 00:51:56.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
the engineering the schools

00:51:56.346 --> 00:51:58.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
teach the engineering but we

00:51:58.315 --> 00:51:58.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
made it happen. And we're real

00:51:58.915 --> 00:52:00.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
proud of that.

00:52:00.283 --> 00:52:02.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Era flicks program it's it's

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:04.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
it's overlaying the traditional

00:52:04.554 --> 00:52:06.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
education systems.

00:52:06.323 --> 00:52:08.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Putting on top of that an

00:52:08.425 --> 00:52:10.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
apprenticeship programs so we

00:52:10.293 --> 00:52:10.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
designed this apprenticeship

00:52:10.894 --> 00:52:12.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
program so that the employers

00:52:12.662 --> 00:52:14.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
tell us. What the students need

00:52:14.698 --> 00:52:16.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
to be successful

00:52:16.299 --> 00:52:18.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
and then we bring in the proper

00:52:18.502 --> 00:52:20.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
educational components to make

00:52:20.437 --> 00:52:20.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
sure that success now we're

00:52:21.004 --> 00:52:22.606 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
designing other apprenticeship

00:52:22.672 --> 00:52:24.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
programs?

00:52:24.341 --> 00:52:26.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Using the template of the

00:52:26.376 --> 00:52:26.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
aerospace engineering program

00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:28.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
it's terrific some of the other

00:52:28.812 --> 00:52:30.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
innovative programs that were

00:52:30.514 --> 00:52:31.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
doing that are connected to

00:52:31.114 --> 00:52:34.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
education. Were about to start

00:52:34.317 --> 00:52:36.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the uniquely able project in

00:52:36.386 --> 00:52:36.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
which were taking high

00:52:36.887 --> 00:52:38.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
performing.

00:52:38.355 --> 00:52:40.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Autistic individuals and

00:52:40.557 --> 00:52:42.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
training them to be CNC machine

00:52:42.626 --> 00:52:44.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:05%
es

00:52:44.294 --> 00:52:46.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
we have the employers lined up

00:52:46.296 --> 00:52:46.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
we have the community college

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:48.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
lineup is going to do the

00:52:48.565 --> 00:52:49.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
training and they're going to be

00:52:49.199 --> 00:52:52.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
placed. In businesses because of

00:52:52.435 --> 00:52:52.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
this unique partnership.

00:52:52.969 --> 00:52:54.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
With they with some of our

00:52:54.771 --> 00:52:56.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
community colleges were also

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
taking graduates who have

00:52:58.508 --> 00:53:00.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
disabilities.

00:53:00.377 --> 00:53:00.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And we're gonna be placing them

00:53:01.044 --> 00:53:02.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
in various businesses that are

00:53:02.712 --> 00:53:04.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
already lined up we couldn't of

00:53:04.714 --> 00:53:06.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
done it without this community

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:07.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
colleges but they couldn't of

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:08.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
done it without us.

00:53:08.385 --> 00:53:10.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Because the community colleges

00:53:10.654 --> 00:53:12.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
they don't have to keep

00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:14.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
developing different.

00:53:14.291 --> 00:53:16.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Employer partnerships.

00:53:16.293 --> 00:53:18.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
That's what we do they should

00:53:18.495 --> 00:53:20.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
use us to be able to do that and

00:53:20.463 --> 00:53:20.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
leverage our funds.

00:53:20.897 --> 00:53:22.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
And

00:53:22.265 --> 00:53:24.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
funds we needs of huts

00:53:24.267 --> 00:53:26.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
we had about fifty percent cut

00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:26.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
in funds the last ten years.

00:53:26.937 --> 00:53:30.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
For what we do and it for WYO a

00:53:30.373 --> 00:53:32.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
which is our core funding.

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:34.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
We we were able to spend seventy

00:53:34.578 --> 00:53:36.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
percent of those funds on in

00:53:36.413 --> 00:53:38.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

just give you a. Slightly

00:57:39.355 --> 00:57:40.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
different perspective from an

00:57:40.957 --> 00:57:44.561 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
employer. From a business side.

00:57:44.627 --> 00:57:46.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And and Jan is right aye I speak

00:57:46.596 --> 00:57:47.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
all over the country and people

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:48.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ask me all the time will how

00:57:48.765 --> 00:57:49.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
many jobs did you workforce

00:57:49.332 --> 00:57:51.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
board create. The workforce for

00:57:51.067 --> 00:57:52.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
does not create jobs the

00:57:52.802 --> 00:57:54.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
workforce would break basically

00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:56.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
is like the quarterback in any

00:57:56.573 --> 00:57:57.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
community and as you know

00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:58.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
California has forty seven work

00:57:58.875 --> 00:58:00.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
for sports.

00:58:00.543 --> 00:58:01.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And whenever I'm in Washington I

00:58:01.211 --> 00:58:04.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
was remind legislators that even

00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:05.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
though we're one of fifty states

00:58:05.281 --> 00:58:07.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
one out of every eight people in

00:58:07.116 --> 00:58:07.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
the country.

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:08.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Lives in California.

00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:10.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Somebody wants to listen

00:58:10.887 --> 00:58:11.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
everybody's interested.

00:58:11.387 --> 00:58:12.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
But we connect the people we

00:58:12.956 --> 00:58:14.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
have.

00:58:14.657 --> 00:58:18.461 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Business leaders labor education

00:58:18.528 --> 00:58:20.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
nonprofits government. And we

00:58:20.797 --> 00:58:22.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
train workers we help dislocated

00:58:22.866 --> 00:58:24.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
workers and all the forty seven

00:58:24.934 --> 00:58:26.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
work for sports actually all

00:58:26.769 --> 00:58:27.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
five hundred fifty of the work

00:58:27.403 --> 00:58:29.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
force boards that are funded by

00:58:29.138 --> 00:58:30.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Congress. Also run youth

00:58:30.807 --> 00:58:32.609 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
opportunity centers.

00:58:32.675 --> 00:58:34.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And and in the Inland Empire.

00:58:34.577 --> 00:58:36.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
We have a total of eleven Butte

00:58:36.779 --> 00:58:38.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
centers with almost two thousand

00:58:38.781 --> 00:58:40.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
disconnected youth between the

00:58:40.617 --> 00:58:42.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ages of sixteen and twenty four.

00:58:42.585 --> 00:58:43.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
That all success stories once

00:58:43.186 --> 00:58:44.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
they've gotten enrolled in our

00:58:44.954 --> 00:58:46.522 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
system.

00:58:46.589 --> 00:58:48.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So you've heard a lot of numbers

00:58:48.691 --> 00:58:50.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and most of the stuff that I

00:58:50.593 --> 00:58:51.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
would like to talk about already

00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:52.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
been said so but. Maybe I can

00:58:52.929 --> 00:58:54.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
just give you a slightly

00:58:54.898 --> 00:58:55.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
different spin.

00:58:55.265 --> 00:58:56.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
The.

00:58:56.599 --> 00:58:58.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
College graduates are amazing

00:58:58.935 --> 00:59:00.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
right for your university the

00:59:00.904 --> 00:59:01.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
graduate.

00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:02.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
They can't find a job.

00:59:02.605 --> 00:59:06.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
We have employers call are

00:59:06.576 --> 00:59:08.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
America's job centers everyday.

00:59:08.611 --> 00:59:08.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
Then ask for

00:59:08.912 --> 00:59:10.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
a certain.

00:59:10.647 --> 00:59:12.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Type criteria of workforce.

00:59:12.649 --> 00:59:16.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
We don't have those so.

00:59:16.653 --> 00:59:17.253 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
When I talk about it it sounds a

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:18.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
little weird you know you us

00:59:19.022 --> 00:59:20.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
assembly member Cervantes

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:22.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
mentioned our unemployment is

00:59:22.792 --> 00:59:23.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
down to three point seven which

00:59:23.426 --> 00:59:24.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
is.

00:59:24.761 --> 00:59:26.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Almost considered full

00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:27.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
employment full employment.

00:59:27.397 --> 00:59:29.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
But yet there's so many jobs

00:59:29.098 --> 00:59:30.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
looking for people.

00:59:30.667 --> 00:59:32.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
We can't provide them and

00:59:32.702 --> 00:59:34.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
everybody talks about there's a

00:59:34.804 --> 00:59:35.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
shortage of high skilled workers

00:59:35.471 --> 00:59:36.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
that the shortage of high

00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:38.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
skilled workers there is. But

00:59:38.741 --> 00:59:39.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
for us in the Inland Empire

00:59:39.375 --> 00:59:40.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
there is a shortage of middle

00:59:41.044 --> 00:59:42.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
skilled workers you know if

00:59:42.712 --> 00:59:43.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
they're the forgotten middle

00:59:43.313 --> 00:59:44.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
because we don't really have a

00:59:44.881 --> 00:59:45.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
lot of high skilled companies

00:59:45.481 --> 00:59:46.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
that are looking for.

00:59:46.683 --> 00:59:49.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Big time the majority of the

00:59:49.085 --> 00:59:49.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
folks.

00:59:49.319 --> 00:59:51.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
The in California even that need

00:59:51.287 --> 00:59:53.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
to find jobs a middle skilled

00:59:53.222 --> 00:59:54.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
workers

00:59:54.757 --> 00:59:55.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
we've just got to find a better

00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:56.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
way.

00:59:56.693 --> 00:59:59.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
To do that now of this gentleman

00:59:59.162 --> 01:00:00.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
mentioned.

01:00:00.797 --> 01:00:02.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
The four year universities and I

01:00:02.865 --> 01:00:03.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
hope there's nobody here

01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:04.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
representing a four year

01:00:04.901 --> 01:00:05.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
university because I don't

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:06.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
offend anybody.

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:08.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
I have.

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:10.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
To millennials at home and they

01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:11.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
did both both go to four year

01:00:11.507 --> 01:00:12.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
universities but everybody

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:14.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
doesn't need to go to four year

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:15.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
university so many other.

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:17.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Students that come out of four

01:00:17.146 --> 01:00:18.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
year universities have these

01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:19.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
huge debts and then they can't

01:00:19.315 --> 01:00:20.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
find a job. So I wanna

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:24.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
references survey nine years ago

01:00:24.687 --> 01:00:25.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
when we had the mortgage

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:26.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
meltdown the national workforce

01:00:26.856 --> 01:00:28.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
board did a survey a national

01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:30.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
survey around the country.

01:00:30.727 --> 01:00:32.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And they ask employers if you

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:34.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
have a college graduate looking

01:00:34.831 --> 01:00:36.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
for a job posting you have and

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:38.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
you have a sixty five year old

01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:39.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
older worker because that was

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:41.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
the time when everybody's for

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:42.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
one case were decimated and a

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:43.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
lot of older workers.

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:44.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
Wanted to stay.

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:46.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So we asked them who would you

01:00:46.776 --> 01:00:47.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
hire and seventy five percent of

01:00:47.443 --> 01:00:48.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
them said of course we would

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:49.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
hire the college graduate

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:50.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
because there are you know more

01:00:51.014 --> 01:00:52.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
passion that they have.

01:00:52.749 --> 01:00:53.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
They're more they know more

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:54.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
stuff.

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:56.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Last year we did the same survey

01:00:56.853 --> 01:00:58.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
at seventy five percent of them

01:00:58.855 --> 01:00:59.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
said well heart of the older

01:00:59.422 --> 01:01:00.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
workers.

01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:01.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Because the younger people

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:04.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
nowadays.

01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:05.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
And I think part of this is

01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:07.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
because we decimated the ROP

01:01:07.096 --> 01:01:08.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
programs from the schools.

01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:11.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
When I was going to high school

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:12.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
eighty three percent of the

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:14.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
students in high school had some

01:01:14.904 --> 01:01:16.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
connection to business.

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:18.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Now we did the state board did

01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:20.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
some numbers two years ago and

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:21.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
less than ten percent of the

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:23.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
students in high schools of any

01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:24.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
connection to business.

01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:26.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So when they graduate and when

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:28.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
they go for a job interview.

01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:29.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
They're never St don't know what

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to do so we gotta figure out a

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:32.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
way to connect.

01:01:32.822 --> 01:01:34.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Schools and businesses together

01:01:34.957 --> 01:01:36.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
when I talk about.

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:38.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I see business that doesn't

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:39.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
necessarily mean private sector

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:41.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
employment even though. I'm an

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:43.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
officer riverside counties would

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:44.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
largest community bank but I'm

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:45.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
not just talking about private

01:01:45.635 --> 01:01:46.769 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
sector.

01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:48.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
Government jobs.

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:51.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Healthcare jobs nonprofit jobs

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:52.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
any employer.

01:01:52.842 --> 01:01:54.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
There's a disconnect.

01:01:54.844 --> 01:01:56.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
So.

01:01:56.846 --> 01:01:57.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
When sometimes when I speak in

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
front of young people I remind

01:01:59.282 --> 01:01:59.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
them that employment is by

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:00.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
invitation only.

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:03.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Because they will tell me I have

01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:04.887 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
a degree Y. want to hire me
well.

01:02:04.954 --> 01:02:05.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
You know it there's gotta be a

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:06.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
match.

01:02:06.856 --> 01:02:08.925 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
So you have probably heard of

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:10.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
the sling shot program that

01:02:10.927 --> 01:02:11.461 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
we're doing through the state

01:02:11.527 --> 01:02:12.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
board.

01:02:12.862 --> 01:02:13.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
And we.

01:02:13.096 --> 01:02:14.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:02:14.864 --> 01:02:15.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
That split the country of the

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:17.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
state up into fourteen regions

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:18.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
in the Inland Empire is one

01:02:18.968 --> 01:02:20.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
region so riverside county

01:02:20.837 --> 01:02:21.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
workforce development board and

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:23.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the symbol of the not county

01:02:23.106 --> 01:02:24.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
border working as one.

01:02:24.874 --> 01:02:25.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And what we're doing there is

01:02:25.508 --> 01:02:27.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
basically were convening. And

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:29.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
we've identified to hide them

01:02:29.112 --> 01:02:31.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
growth sectors here healthcare

01:02:31.147 --> 01:02:31.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and manufacturing and what we've

01:02:31.814 --> 01:02:32.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
done is we've brought.

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:35.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A top level folks from those two

01:02:35.218 --> 01:02:36.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
industries together and have

01:02:37.019 --> 01:02:39.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
them tell us what do you need

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:39.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
what workers do you need and

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:41.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
then be done that the.

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Educational institutions and

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:42.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
said.

01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:44.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Okay.

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:46.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Britain prepare curriculum to

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:47.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
match this and then if they come

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:49.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
out and they go through that

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:50.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
certification.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
They're guaranteed a job so

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:54.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
everybody doesn't need to go to

01:02:55.037 --> 01:02:55.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
four year university folks can

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:57.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
get out of high school go to an

01:02:57.306 --> 01:02:59.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
apprenticeship training program

01:02:59.175 --> 01:03:00.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
through that. Trades

01:03:00.877 --> 01:03:01.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and they can start making twenty

01:03:01.544 --> 01:03:03.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
five dollars an hour at age

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:04.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
twenty twenty one twenty two

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:05.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
they can go into aerospace that

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:06.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
can become.

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:09.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Plumbers or electricians or

01:03:09.185 --> 01:03:11.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
auto mechanics and they can have

01:03:11.187 --> 01:03:12.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
family supporting jobs community

01:03:12.889 --> 01:03:13.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
colleges will play a big role

01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:14.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
associates degrees yes.

01:03:14.924 --> 01:03:16.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
But four year universities are

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:18.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
great for some people. We just

01:03:19.061 --> 01:03:20.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
have to not have this bias.

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:21.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
For young people saying all

01:03:21.531 --> 01:03:23.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
you're a failure because you

01:03:23.266 --> 01:03:24.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
don't go to four year university

01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:25.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I'm going to stop there because

01:03:25.535 --> 01:03:27.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I know of was short on time

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:34.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
thank you. For listening.

01:03:34.944 --> 01:03:37.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I think you are right you know I

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
actually have a quick question

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:40.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
since you just since you were

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:41.517 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
when a little shorter thing your

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:43.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
time. How as an employer did

01:03:43.386 --> 01:03:45.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
used get started in working with

01:03:45.421 --> 01:03:47.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the workforce investment board

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:49.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
what was what was that kind of

01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:52.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
catalyst for that?

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:54.897 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
As an employer world was looking

01:03:54.964 --> 01:03:55.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
for workers and I was involved

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:56.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
in the chamber of commerce.

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:58.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
And I had heard that.

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:01.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
There are a this is the nation's

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:02.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
public workforce system

01:04:02.972 --> 01:04:04.941 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
so I called my county
supervisor.

01:04:05.007 --> 01:04:06.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
And had them appoint me.

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:09.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And my wife is still cursing

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:11.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that county supervisor. Thought

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:12.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
that.

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:13.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
We'll tell her we we appreciate

01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:14.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
it.

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:16.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
A pleasure.

01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:19.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So I just hearing our panelist

01:04:19.222 --> 01:04:20.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
in this dire.

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:23.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Discussion it was quite exciting

01:04:23.259 --> 01:04:25.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
for me to hear about. The new

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:27.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
innovative CT models and

01:04:27.263 --> 01:04:28.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
pathways

01:04:28.998 --> 01:04:31.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I that. Is happening now in the

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LA county area czar it unites

01:04:33.302 --> 01:04:34.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
only want to see that.

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:37.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Here riverside county that's

01:04:37.273 --> 01:04:37.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
great you know Jim million

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:38.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
mentioned some.

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:41.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Things that I know riverside

01:04:41.277 --> 01:04:43.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
county is working on. How can we

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:45.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
further ensure that we how about

01:04:45.314 --> 01:04:47.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
middle skilled workforce to hear

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:49.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
what what is it that you need

01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:50.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
from the state legislature?

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:52.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
You can share your thoughts

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:55.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I think. One of the encouraging

01:04:55.458 --> 01:04:57.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
things this morning with the

01:04:57.426 --> 01:04:59.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
budget the new federal budget

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:01.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
because of all this money comes.

01:05:01.163 --> 01:05:03.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
From the vets and the workforce

01:05:03.266 --> 01:05:05.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
dollars a different grants.

01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:07.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Through the labor agency on the

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:07.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
various agencies so.

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:09.505 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
The two year budget actually has

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:11.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
put more money and then what the

01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:13.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
president wanted so now we're

01:05:13.276 --> 01:05:15.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
going to go over the next three

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:15.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
months going to continue to

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:17.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
advocate the appropriations

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:19.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
committees to make sure.

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:21.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
But I I just came back from

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:21.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Washington DC I was there the

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:23.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
last three days and.

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:25.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Ninety percent of the members of

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:27.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Congress we talk to both sides

01:05:27.156 --> 01:05:31.360 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
of the aisle programs in fact
the president

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:33.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
even keeps pushing

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:35.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
apprenticeship programs. So I

01:05:35.164 --> 01:05:36.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
think that the workforce

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:37.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
innovation opportunities act

01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:39.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
funding is going to continue and

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:40.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
there will be more grants

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:41.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
competitive grants and

01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:43.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
California always does well with

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:43.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
those so.

01:05:43.706 --> 01:05:45.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
The state board of the labor

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:47.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
agency will continue to do that

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:48.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I guess one of the challenges we

01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:49.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
have assembly rooms Cervantes

01:05:49.645 --> 01:05:50.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
and you can help us.

01:05:51.013 --> 01:05:53.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And and not to take anything

01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:53.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
away from you but we have to

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:55.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
always compete with the coastal

01:05:55.418 --> 01:05:56.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
counties.

01:05:57.019 --> 01:05:58.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
So we'll have to just have.

01:05:59.021 --> 01:05:59.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Yeah.

01:05:59.221 --> 01:06:03.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Thank you.

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:04.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Can I also chime in on that.

01:06:05.027 --> 01:06:05.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
The Senate but they assembly

01:06:05.661 --> 01:06:07.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
bill I think assembly bill one

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:07.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
one one one.

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:11.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
That I know you support.

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:13.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A assembly member Burke and this

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:15.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
is one that will provide us

01:06:15.071 --> 01:06:15.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
needed resources to be able to

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:17.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
continue doing what we're able

01:06:17.406 --> 01:06:19.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
to do. And another thing that

01:06:19.442 --> 01:06:21.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
can be done by the assembly and

01:06:21.377 --> 01:06:22.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
the Senate is this.

01:06:23.045 --> 01:06:25.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Always look to us to provide us

01:06:25.348 --> 01:06:26.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
more flexibility.

01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:28.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
Because.

01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:29.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
There are so many restrictions

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:31.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
on what we can and cannot do

01:06:31.287 --> 01:06:33.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
most of what we do is is has

01:06:33.356 --> 01:06:35.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
nothing to do with the act

01:06:35.358 --> 01:06:37.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
itself that we're doing. Is to

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:39.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
help the people that we need we

01:06:39.095 --> 01:06:39.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
don't get paid to work with the

01:06:39.762 --> 01:06:41.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
community college is a special

01:06:41.397 --> 01:06:43.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
fine. But we do because we know

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:45.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
we have to so flexibility.

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:47.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
To allow us to be able to

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:49.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
deliver the best services

01:06:49.205 --> 01:06:53.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
possible to our clients.

01:06:53.075 --> 01:06:53.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
You can push for more.

01:06:53.609 --> 01:06:55.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
Career pathways.

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:57.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Programs and for more a industry

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
community college partnerships

01:06:59.415 --> 01:07:00.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
that'll make a big difference

01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:09.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that's what's going to happen.

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:09.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
You know we're and we're working

01:07:09.825 --> 01:07:11.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
on the five hundred million but.

01:07:11.394 --> 01:07:13.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I know it's it's never enough.

01:07:13.596 --> 01:07:15.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:07:15.197 --> 01:07:15.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I have one other question about

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:17.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
soft skills.

01:07:17.099 --> 01:07:19.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I I know you mentioned that that

01:07:19.268 --> 01:07:21.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
was kind of one of the things

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:21.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
you felt link learning was was

01:07:21.804 --> 01:07:23.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
providing and it's one of the

01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:25.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
things we hear rate your lead

01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:27.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
where are. You.

01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:29.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
That are are falling behind and

01:07:29.278 --> 01:07:31.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'm just curious what you see is

01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:33.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the best way to kind of promote

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:33.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
those soft skills to create it's

01:07:33.816 --> 01:07:35.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
one thing for kids to go to

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:37.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
school told. To learn the to get

01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:39.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
there are basic education but it

01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:41.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
this day and age soft skills are

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:41.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
so important kids text messaging

01:07:42.057 --> 01:07:45.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
in interviews things like that.

01:07:45.227 --> 01:07:45.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Who curious what your thoughts

01:07:45.828 --> 01:07:45.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
are?

01:07:46.028 --> 01:07:47.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Yeah I think you hit on at the

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:47.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
it's.

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:49.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
It's on the job of a high school

01:07:49.598 --> 01:07:51.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
teacher to teacher of.

01:07:51.233 --> 01:07:53.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Of a young person.

01:07:53.135 --> 01:07:55.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:07:55.137 --> 01:07:55.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Job readiness skills.

01:07:55.604 --> 01:07:57.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
Of.

01:07:57.139 --> 01:07:59.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
You know.

01:07:59.141 --> 01:07:59.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Maybe somebody could argue it

01:07:59.775 --> 01:08:01.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
should be but it isn't tonight

01:08:01.377 --> 01:08:03.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
which and expected to be. A.

01:08:03.179 --> 01:08:05.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Of that should be.

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:07.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Developed.

01:08:07.183 --> 01:08:09.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Really with the experience at at

01:08:09.652 --> 01:08:11.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
at a work site because there's

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:12.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
nothing that the substance for

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:13.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
that.

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:15.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
In the way you do that.

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:17.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Is by having these of work based

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:19.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
learning opportunities in the

01:08:19.295 --> 01:08:21.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
way you get these work based

01:08:21.163 --> 01:08:21.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
learning opportunities is

01:08:21.697 --> 01:08:23.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
through.

01:08:23.199 --> 01:08:23.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
Some form of its

01:08:23.566 --> 01:08:25.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
it's either Linklater knitting

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:25.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
its arm.

01:08:25.901 --> 01:08:27.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
Of.

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:29.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Any other programs through the a

01:08:29.405 --> 01:08:31.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
incentive grants maybe through

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the governor's. Proposal it it

01:08:33.476 --> 01:08:35.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
really doesn't it really doesn't

01:08:35.177 --> 01:08:35.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
matter how it's done as long as

01:08:35.811 --> 01:08:37.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
there is a.

01:08:37.213 --> 01:08:37.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
Way for the.

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:08:39.215 --> 01:08:41.517 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
For the high schools and to it

01:08:41.584 --> 01:08:42.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
and to a certain extent the

01:08:42.184 --> 01:08:43.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
community colleges

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:45.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to develop these relationships

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:47.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
with employers.

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:47.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And that's where what what were

01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:49.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
you come in on this.

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:49.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
Is.

01:08:49.492 --> 01:08:51.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:55.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Our is providing that. Increment

01:08:55.297 --> 01:08:57.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
of funding because this is.

01:08:57.233 --> 01:08:57.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
More expensive is not part of

01:08:57.833 --> 01:08:59.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
the core.

01:08:59.335 --> 01:09:01.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Mission of of of a high school

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:03.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
it's of the need that

01:09:03.205 --> 01:09:03.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
incremental funding to develop

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:05.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
these.

01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:07.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
These these partnerships and of

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:09.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
a that's where the students were

01:09:09.778 --> 01:09:11.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
and I like to put in one other.

01:09:11.347 --> 01:09:13.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
One other plug.

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:13.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
On the.

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:15.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
That of president Reese

01:09:15.217 --> 01:09:17.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
mentioned a few minutes ago on

01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:17.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
tool enrollment I think that's a

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
that's a.

01:09:19.255 --> 01:09:21.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Which we found that to be a

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:21.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
very successful.

01:09:21.857 --> 01:09:23.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
A way to advance.

01:09:23.459 --> 01:09:25.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:27.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Of the students into thinking

01:09:27.496 --> 01:09:29.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
about the workplace eight.

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:31.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
In a many students of there's

01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:31.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
really great examples in the

01:09:32.034 --> 01:09:35.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Central Valley for example.

01:09:35.271 --> 01:09:35.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Who graduate from high school?

01:09:35.938 --> 01:09:37.606 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Almost have an a a degree and

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:39.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
they are.

01:09:39.275 --> 01:09:43.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Ready to be certified and have

01:09:43.245 --> 01:09:45.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
of a post high school graduate

01:09:45.414 --> 01:09:45.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
degree where they can get into

01:09:46.048 --> 01:09:49.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the workplace or get and it.

Thanks I like to think the first

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:03.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
panel for their comments and we

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:05.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
will move to our second panel

01:10:05.401 --> 01:10:05.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and ask those who are in the

01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:21.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
same bill to come up

01:10:23.285 --> 01:10:23.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%

And before we get started on our

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:47.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
next panel I do wanna invite

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:49.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
everyone in attendance should

join us for a reception shortly

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
after this will have a

01:10:53.382 --> 01:10:53.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
networking reception just down

01:10:53.983 --> 01:10:59.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%

01:11:37.426 --> 01:11:39.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I'm a gadget guy. Automation

01:11:39.662 --> 01:11:43.365 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
man bye by trade and I guess.

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:45.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

still there today.

01:11:53.475 --> 01:12:05.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
So thank you.

01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:07.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
These a lot of this we've heard

01:12:07.856 --> 01:12:09.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
this this afternoon about.

01:12:09.591 --> 01:12:13.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:12:13.462 --> 01:12:15.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
The the fourth industrial robot

01:12:15.864 --> 01:12:17.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
revolution is here and it is

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:17.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
growing.

01:12:18.033 --> 01:12:21.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I had the pleasure of being a

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:22.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
part of the and the and am show

01:12:22.071 --> 01:12:23.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
this week.

01:12:23.472 --> 01:12:25.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And Anaheim there was nineteen

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:27.609 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
thousand manufacturers that were

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:29.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
at the show and I played ping

01:12:29.578 --> 01:12:31.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
pong with the robots and saw all

01:12:31.547 --> 01:12:31.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
kinds of really cool

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:33.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
technologies that's out there.

01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:35.517 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
And I'm thankful that Alexa

01:12:35.584 --> 01:12:37.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
reminded me to get my stuff

01:12:37.586 --> 01:12:39.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
together to come here today and.

01:12:39.521 --> 01:12:41.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
You know and and my uber is and

01:12:41.557 --> 01:12:43.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
and and ways helped me navigate

01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:45.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
my way to this facility. But the

01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:47.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
strength of our economy it's it

01:12:47.663 --> 01:12:49.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
drives the technology

01:12:49.765 --> 01:12:51.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
advancements.

01:12:51.533 --> 01:12:52.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
There's over six hundred

01:12:52.067 --> 01:12:53.769 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
thousand open manufacturing

01:12:53.836 --> 01:12:57.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
positions I today I met with the

01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:58.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
company last week they had

01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:01.376 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
thirty eight jobs that were
open.

01:13:01.443 --> 01:13:01.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Thirty eight they're trying to

01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:03.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
fail

01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:05.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'm seen twelve manufacturers

01:13:05.514 --> 01:13:07.750 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
every single month I have a
team.

01:13:07.816 --> 01:13:07.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

01:13:08.016 --> 01:13:09.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
There's tube like they they

01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:11.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
said earlier there's two point

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
seven million baby boomers that

01:13:13.622 --> 01:13:14.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
are gonna be retiring over the

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:15.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
next decade.

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:17.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
An estimated by two thousand

01:13:17.826 --> 01:13:19.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
twenty five two million jobs and

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:21.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
advanced manufacturing or will

01:13:21.663 --> 01:13:23.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
go on failed.

01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:25.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Another important fact is

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:26.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
there's it takes about ninety

01:13:26.168 --> 01:13:27.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
days for manufacture to recruit

01:13:27.936 --> 01:13:31.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
a highly skilled worker today.

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:32.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
And that current workforces

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:33.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
deficient requiring future and

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:35.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
skills training.

01:13:35.577 --> 01:13:37.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I am and where are we deficient

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
of course it's the technology

01:13:39.548 --> 01:13:41.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
computer skills the problem

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:42.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
solving skills the basic

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:43.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
technical training and math

01:13:43.852 --> 01:13:45.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
skills.

01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:47.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
I like this that this

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:49.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
display I put up here it's it's

01:13:49.558 --> 01:13:51.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
a robot on display but it's that

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:51.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
it's a person who is.

01:13:52.027 --> 01:13:53.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Generating and telling the robot

01:13:53.929 --> 01:13:55.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
what to do but not only that.

01:13:55.798 --> 01:13:57.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
He's doing some innovation

01:13:57.566 --> 01:13:58.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
thinking thinking about that

01:13:58.167 --> 01:13:59.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
process in his supply chain.

01:13:59.601 --> 01:14:01.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
So maintaining the industry

01:14:02.004 --> 01:14:05.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
growth. It will allow us in this

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:07.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
region to position this region

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:09.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
has a major player and advanced

01:14:09.578 --> 01:14:11.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
logistics cement manufacturing

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.448 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
it gives us the competitive
edge.

01:14:13.515 --> 01:14:15.517 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
So what I'm after really is the

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:17.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
manufacturing industry chatter

01:14:17.586 --> 01:14:19.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
aye I want people talking about.

01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:21.590 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I want them to consider. A

01:14:21.657 --> 01:14:23.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
career path in manufacturing

01:14:23.592 --> 01:14:24.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
there's there's so many really

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:27.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
cool technologies that are used

01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:29.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
out there today.

01:14:29.565 --> 01:14:29.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
They need to percent.

01:14:30.065 --> 01:14:31.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
So the impact of what this is

01:14:31.867 --> 01:14:33.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
doing to the manufacturing work

01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:35.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
force gap.

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:37.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I eighty two percent. It it's

01:14:37.539 --> 01:14:39.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
gonna affect customer demand

01:14:39.541 --> 01:14:41.577 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
seventy eight percent it's going

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:42.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
to in fact their productivity of

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:43.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
manufacturing.

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:45.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Our customer service.

01:14:45.881 --> 01:14:49.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A being able to make goods to

01:14:49.551 --> 01:14:51.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that pace that needs to be said

01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:52.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
about the need be made from.

01:14:52.254 --> 01:14:53.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
The impact and the ability to

01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:55.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
innovate to develop.

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:57.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
So what we need we need right

01:14:57.759 --> 01:14:58.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
people we need right skills

01:14:58.327 --> 01:14:59.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
right time a right plan and

01:15:00.062 --> 01:15:01.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
write because.

01:15:01.697 --> 01:15:03.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I love this say they shot here

01:15:03.765 --> 01:15:05.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
this was from the last year I

01:15:05.701 --> 01:15:06.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
took a group of.

01:15:06.101 --> 01:15:07.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Students robotic students and

01:15:08.036 --> 01:15:09.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
gamers students.

01:15:09.705 --> 01:15:11.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Through a company and this is

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:15.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
colony high school. Of it we did

01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:16.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
some really they're holding up a

01:15:16.411 --> 01:15:18.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
little plate here what I like to

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
about this is I'm taking the

01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:21.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
children into a manufacturing.

01:15:21.984 --> 01:15:25.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It environment so they can see

01:15:25.687 --> 01:15:27.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
smell here and and see this

01:15:27.923 --> 01:15:29.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
first hand and and and that's

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:32.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
where I I I love the excitement.

01:15:32.094 --> 01:15:34.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Into to work with these these

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:35.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
children.

01:15:35.731 --> 01:15:36.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So one of the work force needs

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:37.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
there's a list up here of what's

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:39.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
needed here and when I looked at

01:15:40.002 --> 01:15:41.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
this less putting together this

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:42.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
presentation today was like well

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:44.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
there's going to be people in

01:15:44.106 --> 01:15:44.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the room that. You know there's

01:15:44.773 --> 01:15:45.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
there's some of these things we

01:15:45.908 --> 01:15:47.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
cannot a fact so I removed those

01:15:47.976 --> 01:15:49.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
things here and so under the

01:15:49.945 --> 01:15:51.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
skilled production workers. What

01:15:51.813 --> 01:15:53.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
we really need to do is it is it

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:55.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
create an attractive

01:15:55.717 --> 01:15:57.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
attractiveness of this industry?

01:15:57.753 --> 01:15:59.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And the and the access to talent

01:15:59.922 --> 01:16:01.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
goes on to the other side the

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:02.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
engineering research and

01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:03.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
scientists but it was

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:04.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
interesting to look at this data

01:16:04.593 --> 01:16:06.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
as I put this all together for

01:16:06.194 --> 01:16:07.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
you today.

01:16:07.763 --> 01:16:09.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
So what a CMT see doing a

01:16:09.765 --> 01:16:10.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
specifically in the Inland

01:16:10.332 --> 01:16:11.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Empire I've been in the Inland

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Empire a very passionate about

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:14.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
manufactures in the Inland

01:16:14.202 --> 01:16:14.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
Empire.

01:16:14.436 --> 01:16:15.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:17.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Assembly woman thank you for

01:16:17.973 --> 01:16:19.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
shadowing me out and the

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:21.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
manufacturing plants it's an

01:16:21.777 --> 01:16:23.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
honor to have you inside those

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:25.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
plants seen for yourself. Of

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:27.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
what they're making.

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:29.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I my mother moved into my guest

01:16:29.851 --> 01:16:30.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
house about two years ago and as

01:16:30.519 --> 01:16:32.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I drive around the Inland Empire

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'm pointing out there making

01:16:33.889 --> 01:16:34.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
skateboards they're they're

01:16:34.456 --> 01:16:35.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
doing baseball bats they're

01:16:35.991 --> 01:16:36.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
they're making bottles there.

01:16:36.591 --> 01:16:38.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
It's it's a crazy little her way

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:40.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
to drive with me but there's so

01:16:40.195 --> 01:16:41.897 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
many cool things that are

01:16:41.964 --> 01:16:43.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
happening in this region so what

01:16:43.799 --> 01:16:45.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
are we doing. I've organized.

01:16:45.734 --> 01:16:47.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
In this region a CEO group and

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:49.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
for four years now the CEO grope

01:16:49.938 --> 01:16:51.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
their all.

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Manufactures we come together

01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:55.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
once a month and through this

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:56.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
group I've been taking this

01:16:56.311 --> 01:16:58.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
group into schools to speak and

01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
talk about to the youth about

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:01.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
how they started in maybe in

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:02.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
their garage.

01:17:02.384 --> 01:17:03.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:04.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It gets that the students very

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:04.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
excited about this.

01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:07.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:17:07.756 --> 01:17:08.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
I am part of the corona

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:10.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
manufactures council I'm part of

01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:11.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
the fines Hannah manufactures

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
counsel I work very closely work

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:15.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
with the workforce development

01:17:15.731 --> 01:17:17.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
board. And and we have the peer

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:18.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
counsel.

01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:19.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
At through CMT see.

01:17:19.768 --> 01:17:23.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Of we provide recruitment

01:17:23.739 --> 01:17:24.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
services for management in the

01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:26.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
higher technology positions at

01:17:26.174 --> 01:17:27.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
the manufacturing level.

01:17:27.776 --> 01:17:29.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And another thing that I am very

01:17:29.945 --> 01:17:31.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
passionate about his national

01:17:31.913 --> 01:17:33.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
manufacturing day have. Have

01:17:33.849 --> 01:17:35.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
from a sigh of hands who is

01:17:35.884 --> 01:17:37.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
aware of national manufacturing

01:17:37.753 --> 01:17:39.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
day is the very first Friday. Of

01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:41.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
October I speak throughout the

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:43.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Inland Empire about this day and

01:17:43.825 --> 01:17:44.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
what I love about this day is

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:45.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
it's a day were manufactures can

01:17:45.827 --> 01:17:47.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
open up their doors. And allow

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:49.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
the community their suppliers

01:17:49.765 --> 01:17:52.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
their employees families to come

01:17:52.067 --> 01:17:53.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
into that cell manufacturing

01:17:54.002 --> 01:17:55.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
plant and see what's being made

01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:56.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
in this region.

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:57.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:17:57.806 --> 01:18:00.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So we do that we are part of the

01:18:00.108 --> 01:18:01.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
whole make and you make it in

01:18:01.977 --> 01:18:03.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
America program the California

01:18:04.046 --> 01:18:05.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
make program. And of course the

01:18:05.847 --> 01:18:07.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MTC we do have a TP funding for

01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:09.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
incumbent new hire training. And

01:18:10.052 --> 01:18:12.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
that also supports a career

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
ladders.

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:14.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
As an entry as that.

01:18:14.289 --> 01:18:15.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:18:15.824 --> 01:18:17.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I man who focuses on the

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:20.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
manufacturers in this region I

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:22.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
am partnered with the community

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:23.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
college.

01:18:23.832 --> 01:18:25.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I I love working with the Norco

01:18:25.967 --> 01:18:27.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
campus here they have five

01:18:27.803 --> 01:18:28.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
different apprenticeship

01:18:28.336 --> 01:18:30.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
programs that I am I I steer out

01:18:30.238 --> 01:18:32.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
been and and use through my

01:18:32.207 --> 01:18:33.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
manufactures.

01:18:33.842 --> 01:18:36.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I use the Norco branch almost

01:18:36.078 --> 01:18:37.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
like my apple one aye aye. They

01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:38.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
have.

01:18:38.246 --> 01:18:41.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Ways of helping my manufactures

01:18:41.817 --> 01:18:43.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
fill these positions.

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:45.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
As I put this the slide deck

01:18:46.021 --> 01:18:48.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
together there's a lot of things

01:18:48.123 --> 01:18:49.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
that kind of came out of this

01:18:49.958 --> 01:18:51.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and the to and read that I I

01:18:51.893 --> 01:18:52.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
want to point out to you and

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:54.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
that is. The scope of

01:18:54.129 --> 01:18:56.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
productivity is huge when I walk

01:18:56.264 --> 01:18:58.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
into a manufacture there's all

01:18:58.300 --> 01:18:58.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
kinds of ways that we can help

01:18:58.934 --> 01:18:59.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
them grow.

01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:02.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And there's obviously going to

01:19:02.337 --> 01:19:03.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
be some job I've displacement

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:06.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
but I think net net. Automation

01:19:06.074 --> 01:19:07.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
a robotic technologies allow for

01:19:08.043 --> 01:19:09.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
the expansion of human

01:19:09.878 --> 01:19:10.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
consciousness and the expansion

01:19:10.512 --> 01:19:12.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
of jobs and new opportunities in

01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:13.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
this region.

01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:16.251 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%

01:19:20.188 --> 01:19:22.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that's just fascinating to get

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:24.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the children around to see this

01:19:24.092 --> 01:19:24.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
type of technology.

01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:26.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
So some potential solutions for

01:19:26.394 --> 01:19:28.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
manufacturers I'll go to the two

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:30.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that I like the most here. And

01:19:30.098 --> 01:19:32.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
that's the of managing the.

positions and then the redesign

01:19:44.146 --> 01:19:45.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and the recent thinking of the

where they've come from and what

01:21:24.412 --> 01:21:25.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
they've talked about I think

01:21:26.047 --> 01:21:27.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
it's important to note that if

01:21:28.016 --> 01:21:30.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
we continue to teach like we

01:21:30.085 --> 01:21:32.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
used to.

We're going to Robert children

01:21:34.055 --> 01:21:34.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
of tomorrow and if you look at

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:36.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
the the picture that I have a

01:21:36.524 --> 01:21:40.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
better. You see the old.

01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:47.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I think that really talked to

01:21:47.969 --> 01:21:50.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
what we're talking a ballot new

01:21:50.205 --> 01:21:52.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
education. OB new methods of

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:54.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
teaching

01:21:54.075 --> 01:21:56.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
one of my other thoughts on this

01:21:56.077 --> 01:21:56.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
year's I'm about to be the owner

01:21:56.711 --> 01:21:58.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
of a nineteen twenty seven model

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:00.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
eight. And of course that is

01:22:00.515 --> 01:22:02.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
going to be my project in

01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:04.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
retirement stuff history to

01:22:04.386 --> 01:22:06.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
rebuild this now I can rebuild

01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:08.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that but if you ask me to go

01:22:08.356 --> 01:22:10.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
into a two thousand eighteen. Of

Ford F. one fifty forget it I'm

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:14.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
not even gonna look at that car

01:22:14.829 --> 01:22:16.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
so that just tells you the kind

01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:18.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
of skills in the technical

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:20.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
skills that we are now. Teaching

01:25:00.228 --> 01:25:02.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
As we move into robotics

01:25:02.297 --> 01:25:04.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
yeah under coating we also

01:25:04.599 --> 01:25:06.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
include the supply chain

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:08.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
technology program.

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:10.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
We do have another school set up

01:25:10.438 --> 01:25:12.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
in the. Room next door from

A three D. printer in some of

01:25:16.744 --> 01:25:18.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
the project that they've

01:25:18.446 --> 01:25:18.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
developed as well as some of

01:25:19.047 --> 01:25:20.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
these robotics.

01:25:20.281 --> 01:25:22.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
But they plan on.

01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:22.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Demonstrating after this is

01:25:22.917 --> 01:25:24.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
over.

01:25:24.285 --> 01:25:26.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
We have teachers that a ten

01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:28.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

steel engineering.

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:42.804 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Another program that we're

01:25:42.871 --> 01:25:44.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
highlighting in industry sector

01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:46.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that we really are. Are moving

01:25:46.574 --> 01:25:48.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
forward with is the

01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:50.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
transportation industry sector.

01:25:50.311 --> 01:25:52.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
We all of us an automotive

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:54.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
technology program. It whenever

01:25:54.516 --> 01:25:56.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I schools in you can see from

01:25:56.518 --> 01:25:56.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
the pictures.

01:25:56.851 --> 01:26:00.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
There's a simulated electrical

01:26:00.488 --> 01:26:02.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
system trainer taught in our

01:26:02.557 --> 01:26:04.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
automotive technology program

01:26:04.425 --> 01:26:06.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and what's cool about this

01:26:06.494 --> 01:26:08.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
erodes the Chiu the instructor

01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:12.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
can set the system up where a

01:26:12.433 --> 01:26:12.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
student can troubleshoot.

01:26:12.967 --> 01:26:24.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
The electronic system this

01:26:24.546 --> 01:26:25.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
display had every electronic to

01:26:25.179 --> 01:26:25.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%

In a car.

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:26.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
And so the students can

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:26.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
troubleshoot out.

01:26:26.581 --> 01:26:27.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Interior that we've been

01:26:27.148 --> 01:26:36.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
looking to implement for the

have ground school.

01:26:39.894 --> 01:26:40.461 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Of course in that we can get

01:26:40.528 --> 01:26:42.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
students started. In that

01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:43.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

01:31:08.563 --> 01:31:09.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
you know with your the fast said

01:31:09.230 --> 01:31:10.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
that started on October the

01:31:10.631 --> 01:31:11.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
first. To start sending out

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:12.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
communications to high school

01:31:12.834 --> 01:31:14.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
seniors informing them that what

01:31:15.036 --> 01:31:16.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
financial aid was available to

01:31:16.938 --> 01:31:18.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
them so that they could have the

01:31:19.006 --> 01:31:20.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
opportunity. To search and to

01:31:20.875 --> 01:31:22.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
look to see that maybe a four

01:31:23.044 --> 01:31:24.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
year institution wasn't for them

01:31:24.912 --> 01:31:26.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
but a community college or

01:31:26.681 --> 01:31:28.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
vocational technical program was

01:31:28.683 --> 01:31:30.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%

numerous students and families

01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:34.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
that they took that letter to

01:31:34.889 --> 01:31:36.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
their college counselors many of

01:31:36.691 --> 01:31:37.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
them believe that they didn't

01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:38.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
have the financial resources to

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:40.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
go. Many of them when you when

01:31:40.895 --> 01:31:42.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
you ask them about college and

01:31:42.697 --> 01:31:43.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
many of them will tell you that

01:31:43.364 --> 01:31:46.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
college isn't for them. But when

they believe that they can take

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:53.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

students many of these cal grant

01:34:03.504 --> 01:34:04.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
see students.

01:34:04.839 --> 01:34:05.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Do not qualify for the

01:34:05.306 --> 01:34:06.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
entitlement program.

01:34:06.841 --> 01:34:09.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
And there are students that

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:10.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
graduate directly from high

01:34:10.978 --> 01:34:12.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
school who become eligible for

01:34:12.813 --> 01:34:13.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
the high school entitlement

01:34:13.381 --> 01:34:15.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
program but as you may know many

01:34:15.249 --> 01:34:16.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
of the students who. Do not

01:34:17.018 --> 01:34:19.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
enter college immediately after

01:34:19.253 --> 01:34:21.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
high school and two years later

01:34:21.155 --> 01:34:23.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
decide to take the courses

01:34:23.157 --> 01:34:26.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
necessary. To increase their

01:34:26.927 --> 01:34:28.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
training or their skill set.

01:34:28.863 --> 01:34:29.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
They do not qualify for the cal

01:34:29.497 --> 01:34:31.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
grant program and unfortunately

01:34:31.132 --> 01:34:32.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
they lose an opportunity to have

01:34:32.967 --> 01:34:34.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
an entitlement award. Therefore

01:34:35.036 --> 01:34:36.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the cal grant see program is

01:34:36.904 --> 01:34:39.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
very important and it is one of

01:34:39.073 --> 01:34:39.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the programs that they get they

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:41.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
may qualify for and continue to

01:34:41.208 --> 01:34:43.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
receive to. Help to offset the

01:34:43.177 --> 01:34:44.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
costs of those.

01:34:44.979 --> 01:34:47.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Expenses for the uniforms for

01:34:47.081 --> 01:34:48.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
books for any of the supplies

01:34:49.016 --> 01:34:49.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
that they need.

01:34:49.383 --> 01:34:51.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Whether enrolled in their

01:34:51.318 --> 01:34:52.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
vocational your career technical

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
education program.

01:34:54.889 --> 01:34:56.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
We look forward to continue

01:34:56.857 --> 01:34:57.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
working with the legislature to

01:34:57.525 --> 01:34:59.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
see how we can improve the

01:34:59.193 --> 01:35:01.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
program how we can reach out how

01:35:01.395 --> 01:35:03.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
we can make the program more

01:35:03.097 --> 01:35:04.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
available we're very happy to

01:35:05.032 --> 01:35:05.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
see that the increase of the

01:35:05.633 --> 01:35:07.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
award and we're very thankful to

01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:08.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
see that the award was. Increase

01:35:09.036 --> 01:35:10.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
as we do believe that there are

01:35:10.938 --> 01:35:12.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
cost beyond what the students

01:35:12.873 --> 01:35:15.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
can afford to attend in some of

01:35:15.276 --> 01:35:16.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
these programs even with the

01:35:16.944 --> 01:35:18.979 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
with some of the bog fee
waivers.

01:35:19.046 --> 01:35:21.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Some of that the institutional

01:35:21.182 --> 01:35:22.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
aid that's provided to them

01:35:23.017 --> 01:35:24.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
there's still a huge gap for

01:35:24.952 --> 01:35:25.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
many of the students so work and

01:35:25.653 --> 01:35:27.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
continue to work and hope that.

01:35:27.321 --> 01:35:29.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
We can see an increase in these

01:35:29.290 --> 01:35:31.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
programs in terms of the amount

01:35:31.125 --> 01:35:32.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and it continues to get it

01:35:32.893 --> 01:35:34.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
apart that its need thank you.

01:35:34.829 --> 01:35:38.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%

covers the Inland Empire and we

01:36:15.402 --> 01:36:17.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
have another one. That covers

01:36:17.071 --> 01:36:18.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that greater Los Angeles area in

01:36:18.906 --> 01:36:21.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LA so what we do is we install

01:36:21.142 --> 01:36:22.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
solar electricity systems to

01:36:23.010 --> 01:36:24.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
families that qualify depending

01:36:24.845 --> 01:36:25.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

01:37:11.292 --> 01:37:12.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
volunteers are actually looking

01:37:13.027 --> 01:37:14.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
for jobs in the solar industry?

01:37:15.062 --> 01:37:15.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
And they're with us because

01:37:15.663 --> 01:37:17.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
they like the skill so.

01:37:17.131 --> 01:37:19.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
We encourage woman to come on

interns.

01:37:45.693 --> 01:37:48.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
They were both in their late

01:37:49.063 --> 01:37:51.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
teens early twenties.

01:37:51.098 --> 01:37:51.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
They computer that paid

internship with us while they

01:37:53.434 --> 01:37:55.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
were still in the juvenile hall.

01:37:55.202 --> 01:37:56.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And one of them actually moved

01:37:56.971 --> 01:37:58.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
on to our one year solar core

01:37:58.973 --> 01:37:59.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
program so he's now employed

01:37:59.607 --> 01:38:01.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
with us for one year full time

01:38:01.408 --> 01:38:02.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
employment.

01:38:03.010 --> 01:38:05.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Our troops to solar initiative

01:38:05.379 --> 01:38:07.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
provides solar industry

01:38:07.081 --> 01:38:07.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
workforce training to US

service members.

01:38:11.118 --> 01:38:11.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Across the country so this is

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:13.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
not just only happening. In the

01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:15.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Inland Empire or LA but this is.

can see what's out there in

01:39:13.213 --> 01:39:15.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
terms of of jobs and we do

01:39:15.249 --> 01:39:15.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
recognize that not all of them

are gonna go to college.

01:39:17.084 --> 01:39:19.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
But those that do want to go to

01:39:19.219 --> 01:39:20.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
college have something to put on

01:39:21.055 --> 01:39:21.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
their resume and also have other

01:39:21.722 --> 01:39:23.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
careers to think about. Within

01:39:23.457 --> 01:39:25.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
that renewable industry and

01:39:25.292 --> 01:39:27.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
those that don't want to go to

01:39:27.227 --> 01:39:27.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
college get some hands on

01:39:27.795 --> 01:39:29.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
training before they graduate.

01:39:29.330 --> 01:39:31.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
When I going in there and I do

01:39:31.632 --> 01:39:33.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that in class and training for

01:39:33.534 --> 01:39:35.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
the students we do have a

Jobs and also does where they

01:39:49.283 --> 01:39:51.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
would require more education.

01:39:51.218 --> 01:39:53.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Tops in the solar industry are

01:39:53.153 --> 01:39:55.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
continue to grow and the average

four dollars an hour and they

01:40:01.195 --> 01:40:01.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
actually don't require.

01:40:01.695 --> 01:40:05.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
College degrees.

01:40:05.132 --> 01:40:07.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
And I a. National growing

families nationally.

01:40:13.474 --> 01:40:15.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
We continue to promote

industry.

01:40:17.277 --> 01:40:19.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
We've trained over two thousand

How we advocate for state state

01:40:25.753 --> 01:40:27.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and federal policy we've trained

01:40:27.755 --> 01:40:29.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
over four hundred and seventy

nine tribal volunteers are here

01:40:31.425 --> 01:40:33.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
in the Inland Empire?

01:40:33.293 --> 01:40:33.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And the way we do our work is

01:40:33.927 --> 01:40:35.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
throughs.

01:40:35.295 --> 01:40:37.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Local partnerships with CTE

programs Sau with different high

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:41.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
schools.

01:40:41.201 --> 01:40:43.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And with also political leaders

01:40:43.303 --> 01:40:45.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that recognize the importance of

01:40:45.239 --> 01:40:47.141 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
the work that we do here at
Gran.

01:40:47.207 --> 01:40:49.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
And this is actually our

01:40:49.243 --> 01:40:49.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
national numbers with installed

01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:51.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
over forty thousand kilowatts of

01:40:51.678 --> 01:40:53.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
solar nationally.

01:40:53.213 --> 01:40:55.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Saved over three hundred

01:40:55.516 --> 01:40:56.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
million dollars to families

01:40:56.083 --> 01:40:57.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
sweeper.

01:40:57.217 --> 01:40:59.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Overall we've trained over

01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:01.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
thirty five thousand people up

01:41:01.388 --> 01:41:03.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
for jobs in the solar industry

01:41:03.357 --> 01:41:05.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and this our national numbers.

01:41:05.225 --> 01:41:05.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And the numbers again change

01:41:05.826 --> 01:41:07.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
every single day because we have

01:41:07.694 --> 01:41:09.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
installs every single day at our

01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:11.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
office here in riverside we have

01:41:11.532 --> 01:41:13.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
about. Two to three installs per

01:41:13.434 --> 01:41:15.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
week and that every single

01:41:15.202 --> 01:41:17.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
install we have volunteers

01:41:17.204 --> 01:41:17.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
community members that are

01:41:17.771 --> 01:41:19.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
looking.

01:41:19.239 --> 01:41:19.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
To give back to their community

01:41:19.907 --> 01:41:21.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
or also job trainees which or

people that are looking for jobs

01:41:22.242 --> 01:41:27.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%

opportunity to share about great

01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:30.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and though type of work that

01:41:30.517 --> 01:41:43.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
we're doing.

01:41:43.263 --> 01:41:47.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
Did Jeff.

01:41:47.267 --> 01:41:49.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
To look like the other way.

01:41:49.269 --> 01:41:51.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
A island had a question.

01:41:51.271 --> 01:41:53.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
For Catalina.

01:41:53.273 --> 01:41:55.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
What could we need you to help?

01:41:55.375 --> 01:41:57.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Facilitate more utilization of

01:41:57.311 --> 01:41:59.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that the cal grant see program

01:41:59.246 --> 01:41:59.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
is it a function of not in

01:41:59.813 --> 01:42:01.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
enough funds per.

01:42:01.281 --> 01:42:03.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Grander how is it what is the

01:42:03.617 --> 01:42:07.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
actual issue.

01:42:07.287 --> 01:42:11.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
The current process I have our.

01:42:11.291 --> 01:42:13.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Identifying who those students

01:42:13.527 --> 01:42:13.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
are.

01:42:13.727 --> 01:42:15.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
When we identifies students

01:42:15.696 --> 01:42:19.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
eligible for cal grant and bees.

01:42:19.299 --> 01:42:21.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
We identify those students as.

01:42:21.335 --> 01:42:23.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:42:23.303 --> 01:42:25.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Students that have indicated

01:42:25.272 --> 01:42:27.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that they're pursuing a a degree

01:42:27.441 --> 01:42:29.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
at a traditional degree. Those

01:42:29.543 --> 01:42:31.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
students in the calcium program

01:42:31.678 --> 01:42:33.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
bid what we do want is we want

01:42:33.647 --> 01:42:35.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
to give those students who are.

01:42:35.315 --> 01:42:37.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Could qualify for an entitlement

01:42:37.618 --> 01:42:39.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ward that entitlement award

01:42:39.386 --> 01:42:41.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
because it provides them more in

01:42:41.355 --> 01:42:43.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
terms of the tuition and fees.

01:42:43.323 --> 01:42:43.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And it also provides in four

01:42:43.924 --> 01:42:45.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
years of those benefits.

01:42:45.325 --> 01:42:47.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Those students who do not meet

01:42:47.594 --> 01:42:49.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
those qualifications than. And

01:42:49.496 --> 01:42:51.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
up in the pool of applicants for

01:42:51.632 --> 01:42:53.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
the cal grant see program.

01:42:53.333 --> 01:42:55.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Once we identify who those

01:42:55.469 --> 01:42:57.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
students are we send out a

01:42:57.538 --> 01:42:59.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
what's called a supplement that

01:42:59.606 --> 01:43:01.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ask for additional information

01:43:01.341 --> 01:43:01.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
to identify the types of

01:43:01.875 --> 01:43:03.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
programs there and.

01:43:03.377 --> 01:43:05.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And I think sometimes students

01:43:05.779 --> 01:43:07.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
are confused and the types of

01:43:07.648 --> 01:43:08.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
programs are real Bigelow

01:43:08.181 --> 01:43:09.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
enrolling classes they may not

01:43:09.716 --> 01:43:11.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
know that the classes they're

01:43:11.685 --> 01:43:13.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
taking organ and lead to a

01:43:13.453 --> 01:43:15.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
particular. Certificate or

01:43:15.355 --> 01:43:15.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
programs that she if the campus

01:43:15.989 --> 01:43:17.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that an identified as such. And

01:43:17.591 --> 01:43:21.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
so they said will. Indicate that

01:43:21.628 --> 01:43:23.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
they are identify themselves as

01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:25.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
not being eligible for the for

01:43:25.566 --> 01:43:25.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
the casi program.

01:43:25.966 --> 01:43:26.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
If we had a better opportunity

01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:27.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
to.

01:43:27.401 --> 01:43:29.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:43:29.403 --> 01:43:33.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Get date out or identify those

01:43:33.373 --> 01:43:33.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
students better who are in those

01:43:34.041 --> 01:43:35.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
programs them we could directly

01:43:35.809 --> 01:43:37.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
communicate with them and form

01:43:37.644 --> 01:43:39.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
them and process them through.

01:43:39.546 --> 01:43:41.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And inform them that they're

01:43:41.381 --> 01:43:43.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
eligible and just send the funds

01:43:43.483 --> 01:43:45.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
directly to the campus identify

01:43:45.385 --> 01:43:45.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
them on the campus rather than

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:49.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
having to go to this extra step.

01:43:49.423 --> 01:43:49.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Of completing this additional

01:43:50.023 --> 01:43:59.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
form.

01:43:59.433 --> 01:44:00.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
So my question is for Regina

01:44:00.067 --> 01:44:01.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
first off I am very proud to

01:44:01.802 --> 01:44:03.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
have corona Norco unified within

01:44:03.670 --> 01:44:05.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the district and thank you for

01:44:05.539 --> 01:44:07.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
taking me along the tour. Not

01:44:07.507 --> 01:44:07.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
too long ago.

01:44:07.841 --> 01:44:09.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I I actually won a highlight the

01:44:09.943 --> 01:44:13.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
quote you mentioned that I like

01:44:13.413 --> 01:44:13.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
you know how do you see

01:44:13.914 --> 01:44:15.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
education.

01:44:15.449 --> 01:44:21.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
Meet the jobs that.

01:44:21.455 --> 01:44:23.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
Education has of course

01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:25.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
changed tremendously over the

01:44:25.792 --> 01:44:29.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
years.

01:44:29.463 --> 01:44:29.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Probably one of the biggest

01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:31.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
impediments we have to continued

01:44:31.765 --> 01:44:33.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
growth.

01:44:33.467 --> 01:44:33.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
In our programs.

01:44:33.867 --> 01:44:35.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
Course

01:44:35.435 --> 01:44:37.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
financial we need to always work

01:44:37.838 --> 01:44:38.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
on that but.

01:44:38.138 --> 01:44:39.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:44:39.473 --> 01:44:41.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
Burke. Teachers.

01:44:41.475 --> 01:44:43.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
We desperately need industry

01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:47.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
experienced teachers.

01:44:47.481 --> 01:44:49.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
And without that of.

01:44:49.483 --> 01:44:51.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
It's harder

01:44:51.451 --> 01:44:53.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
to teach kids a one of my

01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:55.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
favorite sayings from one of my

01:44:55.722 --> 01:44:57.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
mentors was.

01:44:57.491 --> 01:44:59.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Bob people in my profession

01:44:59.459 --> 01:44:59.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
career technical educators who

01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:01.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
do come out of the industry.

01:45:01.495 --> 01:45:03.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
The more where in education the

01:45:03.864 --> 01:45:05.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
more we learn about education

01:45:05.899 --> 01:45:07.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and the less we work learn about

01:45:08.001 --> 01:45:09.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
our profession.

01:45:09.503 --> 01:45:11.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
So it's essential that we

01:45:11.605 --> 01:45:13.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
continue to to. Have trained

01:45:13.707 --> 01:45:15.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
professionals

01:45:15.475 --> 01:45:17.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
in education. And also to

01:45:17.544 --> 01:45:19.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
provide externships an

01:45:19.546 --> 01:45:20.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
opportunities for current

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:21.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
teachers

01:45:21.381 --> 01:45:23.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
to learn.

01:45:23.517 --> 01:45:25.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Thank you for sharing at my next

01:45:25.719 --> 01:45:27.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

climb on the roof they told me

01:46:56.476 --> 01:46:58.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
no because I'm clumsy. But.

01:46:58.078 --> 01:47:01.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'd I am curious at how where

Yeah I currently am a lot of our

01:47:17.764 --> 01:47:18.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
volunteers actually come through

01:47:18.398 --> 01:47:19.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
partnerships.

01:47:19.566 --> 01:47:21.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And I spoke about that about

01:47:21.835 --> 01:47:22.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
about Ursula futures program but

01:47:22.502 --> 01:47:23.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
we also have.

01:47:23.737 --> 01:47:25.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Partnerships with community

01:47:25.539 --> 01:47:26.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
colleges like college of the

01:47:26.139 --> 01:47:26.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
desert.

01:47:26.373 --> 01:47:27.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
They have.

01:47:27.574 --> 01:47:29.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Peavey program so they don't

01:47:29.810 --> 01:47:31.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
offer the hands on training for

01:47:31.845 --> 01:47:33.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
their students so they send them

A and we're trying anything we

01:52:22.368 --> 01:52:23.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
can do to connect our industry

01:52:23.903 --> 01:52:25.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
and industrial fabrics

01:52:25.905 --> 01:52:27.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
with our education system and

01:52:27.974 --> 01:52:28.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
with the businesses to get that.

01:52:28.675 --> 01:52:29.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
That cohesiveness

01:52:29.909 --> 01:52:33.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
to provide the the curriculum

01:52:33.913 --> 01:52:34.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
and the facility to use our

01:52:34.481 --> 01:52:36.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
experts.

01:52:36.583 --> 01:52:38.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
there's a lot of burden on the

01:52:38.284 --> 01:52:39.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
on the businesses

01:52:39.919 --> 01:52:40.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
a step up and open their doors

01:52:40.553 --> 01:52:42.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and do exactly this I appreciate

01:52:42.222 --> 01:52:43.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
all you gotta do.

01:52:43.957 --> 01:52:44.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
We need more of that.

01:52:44.491 --> 01:52:46.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
On our side I am part of the

01:52:46.493 --> 01:52:48.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

while. I'm and so these

01:52:50.463 --> 01:52:52.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
relationships are key and

01:52:52.132 --> 01:52:53.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
critical for us.

01:52:53.867 --> 01:52:56.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
On we do grow our jobs.

01:52:56.136 --> 01:52:58.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Nationally we have our are

01:52:58.204 --> 01:53:00.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
expanding we're blessed to

01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:02.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
really be expanding and and we

01:53:02.142 --> 01:53:04.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
are having a hard time here so

01:53:04.210 --> 01:53:06.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
anything you ask my son wasn't

01:53:06.079 --> 01:53:07.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
crying high school and. What did

01:53:08.014 --> 01:53:08.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
the?

01:53:08.314 --> 01:53:10.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

from there now at. UT I learning

01:53:16.022 --> 01:53:18.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to be a mechanic so an example

01:53:18.091 --> 01:53:18.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
of how we benefitted from that

01:53:18.725 --> 01:53:19.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
so it's very important think

01:53:19.959 --> 01:53:20.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
what you're doing and please

01:53:20.527 --> 01:53:23.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
continue to more.

01:53:23.897 --> 01:53:27.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
But I thought that's.

teachers.

01:53:38.044 --> 01:53:40.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Because unlike many adult pilots

01:53:40.346 --> 01:53:42.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
borrowing teachers so prep

01:53:42.182 --> 01:53:44.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
teachers. Didn't get the kudos

01:53:44.384 --> 01:53:47.987 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
de richly deserve as we all
know.

01:53:48.054 --> 01:53:50.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Because whether you are a

bunk.

01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:56.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Good teachers make a difference

got a like a partnership cell

01:56:28.214 --> 01:56:28.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and I one minute here I got.

Labor code seventeen seventy

01:56:30.616 --> 01:56:32.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
seven point five I won't go do

01:56:32.552 --> 01:56:34.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
it because we have such a short

01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:36.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
time. But it does three things

01:56:36.255 --> 01:56:38.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
for the construction industry.

01:56:38.157 --> 01:56:38.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Is one is a creates a

01:56:38.624 --> 01:56:40.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
procurement.

01:56:40.159 --> 01:56:42.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Advantage and also performance

01:56:42.128 --> 01:56:42.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
requirement ought to use the

01:56:42.729 --> 01:56:44.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
premises and it saves

01:56:44.364 --> 01:56:46.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
contractors literally thousands

01:56:46.299 --> 01:56:46.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
of dollars.

01:56:46.599 --> 01:56:48.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
When the user presses per

01:56:48.601 --> 01:56:50.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
apprentice it's huge.

01:56:50.269 --> 01:56:52.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Are the other thing that it does

01:56:52.138 --> 01:56:52.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
is it creates a sustainable

01:56:52.705 --> 01:56:54.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

01:56:56.175 --> 01:56:56.609 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
It doesn't exist outside

01:56:56.676 --> 01:56:58.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
construction.

01:56:58.177 --> 01:57:00.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
And it really doesn't exist

01:57:00.246 --> 01:57:00.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
outside the state.

01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:02.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And that's why. California has

01:57:02.415 --> 01:57:04.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
led an apprenticeship for eighty

01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:06.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
years that's on that. Labor code

01:57:06.386 --> 01:57:06.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
was enacted nineteen thirty

01:57:06.953 --> 01:57:10.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
seven.

01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:12.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Most importantly though. Is what

01:57:12.325 --> 01:57:14.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
it does is it provides a public

01:57:14.327 --> 01:57:14.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
commitment to apprenticeship in

01:57:14.994 --> 01:57:16.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
construction and at some we

01:57:16.429 --> 01:57:18.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
don't have any other industry

01:57:18.264 --> 01:57:18.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
yet. And so that's my

01:57:18.798 --> 01:57:20.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
encouragement.

01:57:20.199 --> 01:57:22.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Is to look at look into that

01:57:22.268 --> 01:57:24.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
look into those things at that

01:57:24.170 --> 01:57:24.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
procurement advantage the

01:57:24.704 --> 01:57:26.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
financial incentive.

01:57:26.372 --> 01:57:26.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
And also the performance

01:57:26.906 --> 01:57:34.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
requirements.

01:57:34.213 --> 01:57:36.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

And that helps build a resume

01:58:24.497 --> 01:58:26.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
just likely intent because I

really their skill set.

01:58:32.905 --> 01:58:34.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
But this will be that platform

to.

01:58:36.309 --> 01:58:38.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Compensate for that but it's

America. So I end up here

01:59:02.535 --> 01:59:04.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
because I really want to talk to

01:59:04.303 --> 01:59:04.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
you guys about what high

01:59:04.837 --> 01:59:06.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
schoolers see as the benefits of

01:59:06.806 --> 01:59:08.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
CTE program.

01:59:08.341 --> 01:59:08.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
And it's actually really

01:59:08.875 --> 01:59:10.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
interesting that you guys are

01:59:10.543 --> 01:59:10.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
hitting everything.

01:59:10.977 --> 01:59:12.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Spot on that we are requesting

that we want to see change in

01:59:14.747 --> 01:59:14.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
schools.

but these?

01:59:26.359 --> 01:59:28.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
This isn't necessarily something

01:59:28.794 --> 01:59:30.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that most of us want to go into

01:59:30.696 --> 01:59:32.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
literature. Aye we don't learn

01:59:32.598 --> 01:59:34.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
resume building in our classes

01:59:34.333 --> 01:59:34.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

their GPA so I do you want to

02:00:00.993 --> 02:00:02.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

because that's. The main reason

02:00:04.497 --> 02:00:12.405 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
why a lot of us don't and we're
scared to take them

02:00:12.471 --> 02:00:13.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
because we're scared of how they

02:00:13.139 --> 02:00:14.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
might impact our.

02:01:14.467 --> 02:01:15.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
our RCT program that we have

02:01:15.067 --> 02:01:16.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Norco or one of them. What it is

02:01:17.003 --> 02:01:17.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
it's?

02:01:17.203 --> 02:01:20.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Agricultural lated jobs what

02:01:20.773 --> 02:01:22.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
it's teaching you teaching you

02:01:22.775 --> 02:01:24.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
flora mechanics all those types

02:01:24.677 --> 02:01:26.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
of jobs where you get your hands

02:01:26.679 --> 02:01:27.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
dirty where you're out there

02:01:27.246 --> 02:01:28.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
working.

02:01:28.414 --> 02:01:28.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
So what is teaching us it's

02:01:29.015 --> 02:01:29.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
teaching a step that we can use

02:01:29.649 --> 02:01:30.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
out there in the field.

02:01:30.416 --> 02:01:30.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And so is teaching as not only

02:01:31.050 --> 02:01:32.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
what we need to do to get a job

02:01:32.918 --> 02:01:34.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
but it's also be paying us for

02:01:34.487 --> 02:01:35.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
college. Because is teaching us

02:01:35.154 --> 02:01:36.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
leadership skills

02:01:36.489 --> 02:01:36.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
because it's not only the

02:01:37.056 --> 02:01:38.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
classroom but there's a separate

02:01:38.491 --> 02:01:39.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
part of it which is specifically

02:01:39.158 --> 02:01:40.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
designed for leadership. Is

02:01:40.826 --> 02:01:42.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
assigned a designed to teach us

02:01:42.728 --> 02:01:44.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
how to work together as a team

02:01:44.697 --> 02:01:46.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and to we teams. We can take

02:01:46.732 --> 02:01:48.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
that to our colleges and news

02:01:48.834 --> 02:01:49.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
that there. To.

02:01:49.201 --> 02:01:50.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:01:50.536 --> 02:01:52.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Give me so we can his that there

02:01:52.838 --> 02:01:54.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
and. Help us get more access to

02:01:54.974 --> 02:01:55.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
other things.

02:01:55.307 --> 02:01:56.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
It also gives us a.

02:01:56.542 --> 02:01:58.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Connections to industry and

02:01:58.711 --> 02:02:00.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
other people higher up so I

02:02:00.546 --> 02:02:01.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
could from our program we have

02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:02.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
gone to a.

02:02:02.548 --> 02:02:04.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
We've gone to farms up in the

02:02:04.717 --> 02:02:06.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
central Central Valley region so

02:02:06.585 --> 02:02:07.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
we can learn all those types of

02:02:07.219 --> 02:02:08.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
agriculture that we have there

02:02:08.854 --> 02:02:10.556 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and we've gone through. Some

02:02:10.623 --> 02:02:12.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
mechanic mechanical things I've

02:02:12.525 --> 02:02:13.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
gone to the Lincoln electric

02:02:13.125 --> 02:02:14.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
center out there in Reno Nevada

02:02:14.927 --> 02:02:16.495 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
so we can learn stuff about
that.

02:02:16.562 --> 02:02:18.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And so the future CD we're

02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:20.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
really looking for more at.

02:02:20.566 --> 02:02:22.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
More so funding because we are

02:02:22.535 --> 02:02:22.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
currently it's a very.

02:02:23.002 --> 02:02:24.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:02:24.570 --> 02:02:25.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Very expensive program like our

02:02:25.204 --> 02:02:26.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
table that we just by far one of

02:02:26.939 --> 02:02:28.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
our classrooms it was.

02:02:28.574 --> 02:02:30.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
About four thousand dollars just

02:02:30.543 --> 02:02:32.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
for one table so. It's quite

02:02:32.445 --> 02:02:32.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
expensive so once again thank

02:02:33.045 --> 02:02:34.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
you yes.

02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:36.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

students are you know the

02:03:25.131 --> 02:03:26.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
students in Fontana to be

02:03:26.966 --> 02:03:28.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
exposed to industry than they

02:03:28.868 --> 02:03:31.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
normally Paul wouldn't have been

02:03:31.103 --> 02:03:32.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
exposed to and yes these

02:03:32.838 --> 02:03:34.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
programs are expensive.

02:03:34.573 --> 02:03:36.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
But.

02:03:36.575 --> 02:03:37.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
These students are getting new

02:03:37.209 --> 02:03:38.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
skills that.

You know many other schools

classroom.

02:03:44.583 --> 02:03:46.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Alone just last year received a

into a full on a editing studio

02:03:56.695 --> 02:03:58.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
for all students as well as the

02:03:58.798 --> 02:04:00.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TV production studio where we

02:04:00.866 --> 02:04:02.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
have our own studio in the

02:04:02.701 --> 02:04:03.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
students run everything from the

02:04:03.369 --> 02:04:06.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
lighting. To the audio to the

cameras there directing in
their.

02:04:08.774 --> 02:04:10.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And dubbed the great thing

02:04:10.976 --> 02:04:12.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
about this is that we've been

02:04:13.012 --> 02:04:14.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
able to establish.

02:04:14.613 --> 02:04:18.617 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Externships in internships with

02:04:18.684 --> 02:04:22.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

02:04:58.657 --> 02:05:00.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Our I want to invite you to her

02:05:00.693 --> 02:05:01.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Ripper Valley high schools

02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:02.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
innovation center it is

02:05:02.862 --> 02:05:04.897 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
something that is so progressive

02:05:04.964 --> 02:05:08.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
in its pathways to careers that.

02:05:08.667 --> 02:05:10.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I took along my oldest brother

02:05:10.736 --> 02:05:12.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
he said when he was in college

02:05:12.671 --> 02:05:14.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
he did not have programs. That

02:05:14.773 --> 02:05:15.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
job would have served him as

02:05:15.407 --> 02:05:17.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
well as our high school program

02:05:17.176 --> 02:05:20.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
does.

02:05:20.713 --> 02:05:21.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
As I've been listening to dare I

02:05:21.413 --> 02:05:22.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
wanted to say that I'm concerned

02:05:22.915 --> 02:05:26.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
about hearing the phrase living

02:05:26.685 --> 02:05:27.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
wage linked with.

02:05:27.086 --> 02:05:30.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
Of.

02:05:30.723 --> 02:05:32.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A technical education arm this

02:05:32.858 --> 02:05:34.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
seems to imply a minimum and I

02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:38.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
want everyone to know that it

02:05:38.697 --> 02:05:39.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
can be an exceptional.

02:05:39.198 --> 02:05:42.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Road to liver of better than

02:05:42.701 --> 02:05:44.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
living wages I have a master's

02:05:46.872 --> 02:05:49.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
but both of my sons who have

02:05:49.074 --> 02:05:52.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
what is considered. Considered

02:05:52.711 --> 02:05:54.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
blue collar jobs make far more

02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:56.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
money than I ever had so please

and the intent. Is to.

02:06:20.873 --> 02:06:22.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:06:22.775 --> 02:06:23.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
The kids ready for careers in

02:06:23.375 --> 02:06:23.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
the droning street.

02:06:23.809 --> 02:06:24.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

02:06:24.777 --> 02:06:26.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A two year program the first

02:06:26.745 --> 02:06:28.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
year of the in the first year

02:06:28.847 --> 02:06:29.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
they're going to test for the

02:06:29.448 --> 02:06:29.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
one all seven.

02:06:29.815 --> 02:06:31.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
And the FAA one oh seven is

02:06:31.183 --> 02:06:32.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
remote pilot certification.

02:06:32.785 --> 02:06:33.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And so the hope is that the day

02:06:33.452 --> 02:06:34.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
test for that and six

02:06:34.753 --> 02:06:36.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
the pastor.

02:06:36.789 --> 02:06:37.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Following year they'll go out

02:06:37.423 --> 02:06:40.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and do internships and we have a

02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:41.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
grown to build on how drones are

02:06:41.627 --> 02:06:42.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
being you

02:06:42.761 --> 02:06:44.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
in industry. Out to a bill

02:06:45.064 --> 02:06:46.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
designed modify these drones

02:06:46.765 --> 02:06:47.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that I'm I'm pretty excited but

02:06:47.399 --> 02:06:49.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the problem I think is a bright

02:06:49.101 --> 02:06:50.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
future for the kids.

02:06:50.803 --> 02:06:52.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
This kid is my grandson and I

02:06:52.771 --> 02:06:54.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
brought him over to the program.

02:06:54.840 --> 02:06:55.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Because I think again

02:06:55.307 --> 02:06:57.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
opportunity for all higher wage

02:06:57.142 --> 02:06:57.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
jobs.

02:06:57.343 --> 02:06:58.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
Quite frankly.

02:06:58.844 --> 02:07:00.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
Retirement plan.

02:07:00.846 --> 02:07:03.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So I'm looking forward to that

02:07:03.248 --> 02:07:05.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
and I I will say to know just

02:07:05.284 --> 02:07:06.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
the technical side.

02:07:06.852 --> 02:07:08.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
But many of us teachers

02:07:08.821 --> 02:07:10.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
classroom teachers work very

02:07:11.023 --> 02:07:11.590 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
hard and developing self skills

02:07:11.657 --> 02:07:11.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
for.

02:07:11.857 --> 02:07:14.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
The work.

02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:16.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
No the others beside myself

02:07:16.829 --> 02:07:17.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
always going oh over that with

02:07:17.429 --> 02:07:18.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
the kids.

02:07:18.864 --> 02:07:21.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And I think of as they go to

02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:22.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
this program internships it'll

02:07:22.935 --> 02:07:26.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that'll be reflect so thank you.

02:08:14.953 --> 02:08:16.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
capstone is the global logistics

02:08:16.955 --> 02:08:18.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
where we've partnered with chief

02:08:18.791 --> 02:08:20.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

provides meaning a purpose for

02:08:32.971 --> 02:08:33.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
our kids and that's what

02:08:33.539 --> 02:08:35.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
motivates them to get that

02:08:35.207 --> 02:08:38.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
certification on a two year for

02:08:38.811 --> 02:08:40.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
you. So thank you for idea.

tell you the difference that we

02:08:47.219 --> 02:08:48.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
see in our students since we've

02:08:48.821 --> 02:08:49.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
been able to really spend.

02:08:49.388 --> 02:08:52.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Really honestly money and and I

02:08:52.825 --> 02:08:53.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
get the work force out there and

02:08:53.492 --> 02:08:56.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
really make partnerships and

02:08:56.829 --> 02:08:57.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
develop these.

coming go that we consider the

02:09:03.402 --> 02:09:05.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
flexibility of our LC up a

02:09:05.204 --> 02:09:07.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
funding. Because what we built

02:09:07.372 --> 02:09:09.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
we need it to be sustainable.

02:09:09.341 --> 02:09:11.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I'm we partnered for example

02:09:11.410 --> 02:09:13.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
with great in this room and it

02:09:13.345 --> 02:09:15.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
cost us to do this but we know

what our our students aye it's

02:09:17.316 --> 02:09:19.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
benefiting the entire community

02:09:19.184 --> 02:09:20.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

evaporates.

02:12:07.119 --> 02:12:09.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
It makes our job even harder in

02:12:09.154 --> 02:12:09.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
