JOINT HEARING OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW COMMITTEE AND THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE TO ORDER THE SUBJECT FOR TODAY'S HEARING IS CALIFORNIA'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FINES. SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND FOUR PASSAGE OF PROP SIXTY THREE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT THREE CRITICAL REPORTS HAVE RAISED SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STATE'S FAILURES TO DIRECT SPENDING AND OVERSEE THE SPENDING OF THIS PROGRAM. TODAY'S HEARING WILL FOCUS ON THE ONGOING ACCOUNTABILITY AND CORRECTIVE MEASURES THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE SINCE LAST YEAR'S REPORT FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR CHAIR WITH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING MY COMMITTEE FOR THIS HEARING. AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK MAYOR MAYOR DARRELL STEINBERG AND THE SIGN BURKE INSTITUTE BUT FOR THEIR ONGOING WORK ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE AND TO ASK FOR THEIR INPUT IN AS WE PREPARED FOR THIS HEARING. IT'S NO SECRET THAT CALIFORNIA'S BATTLING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. NEARLY ONE IN SIX CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCE SOME TYPE OF MENTAL ILLNESS. MENTAL ILLNESS HAS TOUCHED THE LIVES OF NEARLY EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA AND I WAITED HAZARD TO GAS NEARLY EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM. BUT OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND IS STRUGGLING. AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF A LACK OF FUNDING IN TWO THOUSAND FOR CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS APPROVED PROP SIXTY THREE MILLION YEARS TAX THAT NOW DIRECTS MORE THAN TWO MINUTES TWO BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR INTO SERVICE AS AN ALL TOLD AS THE AS A STATE WE'RE SPENDING NEARLY TEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR I MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. GET THE CRISIS CONTINUES TO GET WORSE AND WE'RE ALL LIVING WITH THE CONSEQUENCES THERE ARE A BURGEONING NUMBER AS MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE LIVING ON CALIFORNIA STREETS WITH AN ESTIMATED ONE THIRD OF THE INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA ALSO BATTLING A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. THE SAME STORY IN OUR JAILS AND PRISONS WHERE ONE THIRD THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE LIVING BEHIND BARS HAD A SERIOUS MENTAL DISORDER THAT'S A HUNDRED AND 50% INCREASE SINCE TWO THOUSAND. SUICIDE RATES ARE ALSO CLIMBING. MENTAL HEALTH WHICH IS VIRTUALLY EVERY MAJOR PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE HEALTHCARE EDUCATION CRIMINAL JUSTICE HOMELESSNESS. AND I THINK FOR ME THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IS HOW ARE WE FALLING SO SHORT ON SOMETHING THAT IS SO VERY IMPORTANT. AS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY IS ACCOUNTABILITY COMMITTEE I AM PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT WE ARE SPENDING. CALIFORNIA'S TAX PAYERS DOLLARS AS EFFECTIVELY AND AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE. SOUP BUT SIMPLY IN TODAY'S HEARING I REALLY WANT UNDERSTAND WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT. WHAT ARE THE ROOT CAUSES AND WHAT ARE WE DOING TO ADDRESS THEM. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ALL OF OUR PANELISTS FOR BEING HERE TODAY LOOK FOR TO A REALLY ROBUST DISCUSSION. CHAIR WHICH THANK YOU AGAIN FOR JOINING US WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE AN OPENING STATEMENT. YES SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS BETWEEN NORRIS AND THANKS FOR SUGGESTING HEARING. EXAMINING THE MHS M. HSA THE EFFORTS TAKEN TO CORRECT THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED THE STATE'S AUDITOR'S REPORT IS VERY TIMELY. AS YOU SAID OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA'S BROKEN. DESPITE THE EFFORTS AND COMMITMENT OF WELL INTENDED INDIVIDUALS AND NEARLY TEN BILLION DOLLARS ARE MENTAL HEALTH REPORT CARD IS INCREASINGLY REFLECTING THAT WE ARE FAILING IN OUR EFFORTS TO ASSIST CALIFORNIANS WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. WE WERE SUFFERING AND WE HAVE NOT YET FOUND APPROPRIATE SOLUTIONS TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS ARE SUFFERING. AND I WILL NOTE THAT YOUR YOUR NOTE ABOUT YOUR YOUR. YOUR COMMENT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE INCARCERATED HAVING HIGH LEVELS OF MENTAL MENTAL ILLNESS. IN ONE OF MY COUNTY JAILS THAT NUMBER IS 50% OF THE POPULATION YOU MENTION A THIRD SO IT BURIES GEOGRAPHICALLY AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT. SO BEAR WITH ME A MINUTE WHILE I ROUTE REVIEW A FEW OF OUR REPORT CARD STATISTICS. REPORTED BY CAL MATTERS PUBLISHED IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN INDICATES THAT AS AS ARE CHAIR SAID NEARLY ONE IN SIX CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCE SOME MENTAL ILLNESS. WITH ONE IN TWENTY FOUR INEXPERIENCE IN ILLNESSES SO SEVERE IT BECOMES DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO FUNCTION IN DAILY LIFE. CALIFORNIA'S TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD EXPERIENCE MAJOR DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AT A HIGHER RATE THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. SUICIDE AMONG ADOLESCENTS AGE FIFTEEN TO NINETEEN INCREASE 63% TRINITY COUNTY AND MY DISTRICT HAS FOUR TIMES THE NUMBER RESIDENTS DYING BY SUICIDE THAN LA COUNTY. THE LRGEST PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTIONS OF THE STATE OF IN THE STATE OR NOT HOSPITALS THEIR JAILS AND PRISONS WITH WITH HUGE NUMBERS OF PRISONERS CURRENTLY RECEIVING TREATMENT FOR SERIOUS MENTAL MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER. AN INCREASE OF A HUNDRED PER ARE FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS NEARLY ONE IN FOUR PATIENTS THEIR REQUIRES SOME SORT OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE. THE NUMBER CALIFORNIA INMATES DEEMED INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL IN ORDER TO STATE HOSPITALS IS INCREASED 60% IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND WE HAVE A 46% VACANCY RATE FOR PSYCHIATRISTS IN OUR STATE HOSPITAL. SO CLEARLY PEOPLE CLEARLY WE HAVE A DISCONNECT AND HOW WE GET CARE TO PEOPLE A SITE TRACK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL BEDS ARE DECLINING WITH ALMOST HALF A COUNTIES HAVING NO ADULT ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC BEDS IN THE VAST MAJORITY WITH NO PSYCHIATRIC SUCH PSYCHIATRIC BEDS FOR CHILDREN THOSE CHILDREN OFTEN END UP IN EMERGENCY ROOMS FOR DAYS. AND DAYS AND DAYS CALIFORNIA ALSO LAGS BEHIND THE COUNTRY. IN PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY RESOURCE SETTING. AND EVEN IF WE HAVE THE FACILITIES HAVE THE BAD HAVE THE RESOURCES. WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. THAN THOSE THAT DO EXIST ARE LESS LIKELY THAN THEIR OTHER HEALTH CARE. PROG PROFESSIONAL COUNTERPARTS TO ACCEPT INSURANCE. PEOPLE CAN ONLY ATTAIN CARE IF THEY HAVE ACCESS TO CARE AND ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DIFFICULT. AND FRANKLY IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS ACCESS TO ALL HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS DIFFICULT. THE STATISTICS ARE STAGGERING AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT THEY'RE SO BRING THESE MEASUREMENTS DON'T EVEN CLEAN CLEAR THE COMPLICATIONS OF COKE OCCURRING ISSUES SUCH AS HOMELESSNESS AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS. IN FEBRUARY MARCH OF THIS YEAR THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE HELP COMMITTEE'S HELD TO JOIN HEARINGS TO DISCUSS MEDICARE OUR MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM. TODAY WE'RE EXAMINING ASPECTS OF THE IMAGE TO M. H. ESSAYS PROGRAM AND DELIVERY SYSTEM I HOPE TO HEAR TODAY THAT THE STATE THE COMMISSION AND THE COUNTIES OF ALL ADOPTED A NEW STRATEGY OF COLLABORATION AND COOPERATION. THAT THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE AUDIT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED AND PUT THE BAD AND THEY WERE MOVING FORWARD WITH A STRONGER SENSE OF PARTNERSHIP. WITH IMPROVED OUTCOMES AS THE FOCUS AND I JUST WANNA SAY I REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYBODY BEING HERE TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO A ROBUST DISCUSSION. THANK YOU MISTER MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU CHAIR WED. ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AT AND BRIEF OPENING STATEMENTS. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MEMBERS AND YES THIS TOPIC IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME PERSONALLY AS NOT LESS THAN A YEAR AGO OCTOBER. I DID HAVE MY OWN BROTHER WHO STRUGGLED WITH NOT ONLY MENTAL HEALTH BUT ADDICTION ISSUES PASSED AWAY. BUT THAT BEING SAID I FELT HAVE FOUND PARTICULARLY IN THE COUNTY OF ORANGE AND NOT ONLY ORANGE COUNTY BUT I'M ASSUMING OTHER COUNTIES THAT IT'S ALMOST BEEN A LIKE AN ONION WHERE WE'VE HAD TO KIND OF CONTINUE TO PEEL BACK THE LAYERS TO FIND OUT. EXACTLY HOW FUNDS ARE BEING USED FROM THE STATE MHS FUNDS IN OUR CASE ORANGE COUNTY WHY ARE FUNDS WERE IN MANY WAYS NOT USED IN A TIMELY MANNER. BUT WHY NOW THAT THERE IS AN EFFORT TO USE THEM THERE'S A VARIOUS ISSUES WITH SOMETIMES USING THE FUNDS SO MY HOPE THROUGH THIS A HEARING IS THAT WE GET A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE FUNDS CAN BE USED FOR WHAT THE FUNDS CANNOT BE USED FROM BECAUSE WE GET MIXED MESSAGES. FROM THAT AS WELL AND HOW WE START TO TAKE WHAT IS MEANT TO HELP WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IN OUR CITIES IN STATE AND GET THEM TO BE USED SO THAT WE CAN START TO RECTIFY SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE ARE NOT ONLY SEEN EVERY SINGLE DAY BUT THAT ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY. CONCERNING AND IN MANY MY CITIES IN NORTH ORANGE COUNTY THEY'VE ACTUALLY DECLARED A CRISIS FOR HOMELESSNESS AND WE KNOW WITH HOMELESSNESS MANY TIMES SOME OF THOSE THAT ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE INDEED HAVE SOME MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SO I THINK WE HAVE A LOT. TO TALK ABOUT AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THE PANELISTS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA. WITH THAT WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED WITH OUR PANELS IN PANEL ONE THAT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IS GOING TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING. AND THE AN HSA OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION WILL PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON STEPS TAKENSINCE LAST YEAR'S AUDIT A GO AHEAD AND LET OUR PANELIST. PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELVES THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING TO THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. RAMBLES THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR TO CHAIR MEMBERS TOBY DOING I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY. THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US TODAY AND I THINK WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED WITH THE LA L. UPDATE THANK YOU GREAT GREAT AND SO WE HAVE Ã´ SHOULD BE A HAND OUT AND ALL OF YOUR PACKETS THAT WILL FORM THE BASIS OF OUR A MARKS. I'M GONNA OPEN BY TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT FINANCING FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND THEN MY COLLEAGUE GRAN WE'LL SEE WILL DISCUSS THE MOST RECENT AUDIT AS WELL AS PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION. TURNING TO PAGE ONE. THE HAND OUT. AND COME IN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES HAVE A MAJOR ROLE IN PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES PRIMARILY BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING THESE SERVICES TO LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS. INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS ON MEDI CAL. AS WELL AS THOSE WITH THE HIGHEST MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. IN ADDITION COUNTIES ARE LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING MHA PROGRAMS ON THE GROUND. ON PAGE TWO OF THE HAND OUT WE HAVE A FIGURE THAT PROVIDES A HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY OF FUNDING FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. MY REMAINING ROOM REMARKS HERE WILL LARGELY SUMMARIZE OUR WALK THROUGH THIS FIGURE. AS YOU CAN SEE AT THE BOTTOM. ABOUT 80% OF TOTAL FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE STATE GOES TO COUNTIES. GIVEN THEIR LARGE RESPONSIBILITIES WITH THE REMAINING 20% GOING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WHICH ADMINISTERS THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AND IS ALSO PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR. OVERSEEING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE STATE. IN TERMS OF FUNDING ON THE TOP RIGHT YOU'LL SEE THAT FEDERAL FUNDS PRIMARILY THROUGH MEDI CAL COMPRISE THE LARGEST SINGLE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR. COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDING OVER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THESE THESE FUND THIS FUNDING IS ONLY AVAILABLE FOR MEDI CAL SERVICES AND TO ANSWER A COMMITTEE MEMBER'S QUESTION A MAJOR COMPONENT THAT IS NOT FUNDED THROUGH MEDI CAL IS ANY SORT OF HOUSING SERVICES. AS WELL AS CERTAIN RESIDENTIAL SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. MOVING TO THE TOP LEFT LOCAL OF THE FIGURE LOCAL REALIGNMENT REVENUES COMPRISE A MAJOR SOURCE REALLY THE NEXT LARGEST SOURCE OF FUNDING THESE ARE PORTIONS OF THE STATE SALES TAX AND VEHICLE LICENSE FEE REVENUES. THAT THE STATE DEDICATES DIRECTLY TO COUNTIES FOR THEM TO. REALLY AS A FLEXIBLE FUND SOURCE FOR THESE COUNTIES TO PAY FOR THEIR VARIOUS MENTAL HEALTH RESPONSIBILITIES WHICH INCLUDE PAYING FOR THE NON FEDERAL SHARE OF COST. FOR MEDI CAL SERVICES AS WELL AS SUCH SERVICES AS THE RESIDENTIAL CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS AND SO FORTH. THE NEXT BOX TO THE RIGHT SHOWS THE IMAGE OF SAY AND THAT IT IS A MAJOR FUND SOURCE PROVIDING TWO BILLION DOLLARS OR ABOUT 20% OF TOTAL FUNDING WITHIN THE SYSTEM. AND THIS DAMAGE SAY WAS APPROVED BY VOTERS IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR IS FUNDED THROUGH A SALE AN ATTACK SO A 1% TAX ON INCOMES OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE. HOW EXPAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ON HOW THE IMAGE SAY WILL BE USED CAN BE USE LATER IN MY REMARKS. AS YOU CAN SEE THE SMALLEST OF THE FUNDING SOURCES NEXT TO FEDERAL FUNDS IS THE STATE GENERAL FUND. BEING ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND GENERAL FUND IS GENERALLY USED FOR FUNDING PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS ON MEDI CAL. AS WELL AS FUNDING NEW SERVICE REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE BY THE STATE OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CENTS TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. NEXT GONNA JUMP ALL THE WAY TO PAGE FIVE OF THE HAND OUT WHICH SHOWS HOW FUNDING IS CHANGED OVER TIME. THIS SHOWS THAT FUNDING HAS GROWN FAIRLY SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE LAST RECESSION AVERAGING ALMOST 8% ANNUAL GROWTH DURING THIS TIME PERIOD WHICH FOR REFERENCES FASTER THAN THEIR LITTLE MORE THAN 5% ANNUAL GROWTH IN GENERAL FUND REVENUES THAT HAS HAS OCCURRED OVER THIS TIME PERIOD. I'M NEXT GOING TO TURN TO DISCUSSING AN HSA IN GREATER DETAIL. THE IMAGES SAY ESTABLISHES A VARIETY OF PARAMETERS OF HOW THIS FUNDING MAY BE SPENT AND WE SUMMARIZE THIS ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE HAND OUT IN THE FIGURE. SO AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE TOP CIRCLE THE STATE DAMAGE SAY RESERVES 5% OF TOTAL IMAGE SAY FUNDING FOR STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES. THIS FUNDING IS AVAILABLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO APPROPRIATE AND IS OFTEN KNOWN AS THE STATE CAP SO AND WHILE SOME OF THIS FUNDING IS USED FOR SAY DIRECTED MINISTRATION GOING TO THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION OR DH YES. SOME FUNDING IS AVAILABLE FOR GRANT OR OTHER PROGRAMS FOR LEGISLATURE SUCH AS TO SEND GRANTS TO COUNTIES TO HIRE CRISIS PERSONNEL AND SO FORTH SO THIS IS ANOTHER USE OF WITH A OF THAT 5% STAKE CAP DOLLARS. THE LARGER A PART OF THAT THAT THE CIRCLE THERE IS THEN GOES TO COUNTIES THIS 95% AND IT GOES DIRECTLY TO COUNTIES. THIS FUND THIS 95% OF FUNDING MUST BE SPENT IN SPECIFIED PERCENTAGES IN ONE OF THREE WAYS. FOR AND THAT'S AND SO THE BOTTOM CIRCLE ON THIS FIGURE WILL DESCRIBE HOW THIS FUNDING IS ULTIMATELY PRESCRIBED TO BE USED. 76% OF THIS FUNDING MUST BE USED FOR COMMUNITY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS WHICH ARE DIRECT SERVICES OFTEN FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH FAIRLY SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. 19% OF THIS FUNDING MUST BE USED FOR PREVENTION AND EARLY ENTER INTERVENTION INTERVENTION ACTIVITIES AND THEN 5% IS TO BE USED FOR INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS TO TRY TO EXPERIMENT WITH NEW APPROACHES. TO AMELIORATING MENTAL ILLNESS. BUT I'D THESE COULD BE SUICIDE AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS OR OR EVEN SORT OF MORE DIRECT SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING EARLY ONSET SO FOR MAYBE A TRANSITIONAL AGE USE TO RECEIVE SORT OF TREATMENT BEFORE THEIR ILLNESS BECOMES TRULY DEBILITATING. I'M AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THESE THREE BUCKETS THEM WHICH IS A DOES ALLOW COUNTIES TO DEDICATE A MAXIMUM OF 20% OF FUNDING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY IS SERVICES AND SUPPORTS COMPONENT TO SUPPORT THEIR LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN ONE OF FOUR WAYS CAPITAL FACILITY DEVELOPMENT. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ADDRESSING THEIR TECHNOLOGY NEEDS. OR PLACING FUNDING INTO A PRUDENT RESERVE. HOW FINALLY NOTE THAT THE IMAGE SAY REQUIRES THAT IMAGE SAY FUNDING THAT GOES TO COUNTIES BE SPENT WITHIN THREE OR FIVE YEARS WITH ANY UNSPENT FUNDING REVERTING TO THE STATE TO BE REDISTRIBUTED TO OTHER COUNTIES. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS NOW I'M GOING TO PASS IT ALONG TO BRIAN WELLS A TO CONTINUE THANK YOU AS DESCRIBED EARLIER IN FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE STATE AUDITOR RELEASED A REPORT. ABOUT AND FUNDING OVERSIGHT RELATED TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. THE AUDIT IDENTIFIED SEVERAL DEFICIENCIES THAT I WILL SUMMARIZE ONE OF THE MAJOR FINDINGS WAS THAT COUNTIES HAD ACCUMULATED SIGNIFICANT. UNSPENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDS AM I SPEAKING FROM PAGE TEN AND HAND OUT FOR REFERENCE. RELATED TO THIS ISSUE THE AUDITOR FOUND THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAD NOT DEVELOPED A PROCESS TO RECOVER. THE END SPEND FUNDS THAT MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED ARE SUBJECT TO REVISION AND THE AMOUNT OF THOSE FUNDS AT THE TIME OF THE AUDIT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. THE PROCESS IDEALLY WOULD HAVE REDISTRIBUTED THESE FUNDS TO OTHER COUNTIES. BUT I'M NOT BEEN DEVELOPED OR IMPLEMENTED AT THAT TIME. FURTHER THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAD NOT ESTABLISHED GUIDANCE ON HOW INTEREST THAT'S EARNED ON. ON SPENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDS SHOULD BE TREATED FOR PURPOSES A REVERSION. AND ADDITIONALLY GUIDANCE AND NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED ON HOW MUCH RESERVES COUNTIES SHOULD. BE KEEPING AND THE AUDITOR FOUND THAT AN ESTIMATED FIVE FOR THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WERE HELD IN RESERVES AND WHICH THE OUTER CONSIDERED EXCESSIVE. THE NEXT MAJOR FINDING WAS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAD. AT THAT TIME PROVIDED MINIMAL OVERSIGHT OF COUNTIES USE OF IMAGES A FUNDING. SOME ISSUES IN THIS AREA INCLUDED. THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT IN FORCE DEADLINES FOR COUNTIES TO TURN IN THEIR ANNUAL EXPENDITURE REVENUE REPORTS AND IN MANY CASES THESE REPORTS FOR SUBMITTED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER DEADLINES. THE DEPARTMENT HAD NOT COMPLETED FISCAL AUDITS FOR COUNTIES AS OF DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WHICH WAS A NEAR THE TIME THE AUDIT WAS RELEASED I'M AT ALSO NOT IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS RELATED TO THESE PROCESSES. AND FINALLY THE DEPARTMENT HAD NOT IMPLEMENTED A PROCESS TO CONDUCT PROGRAM REVIEWS TO ENSURE THE COUNTIES OPERATIONS WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE ACT. THE AUDIT ALSO HAD SOME FINDINGS RELATIVE TO THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. IN PARTICULAR THE AUDITOR FOUND THAT COUNTIES HAD SOME CHALLENGES IN GETTING. FUNDING PROPOSALS FOR INNOVATION PROJECTS THIS IS ONE OF THE AREASWHERE STATE APPROVAL IS REQUIRED. SOME CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF PROJECTS THE COMMISSION WOULD APPROVE WHICH CONTRIBUTED IN PART TOO DIFFICULT IF BY THE COUNTIES IN SPENDING INNOVATION FUNDS. AND THEN ADDITIONALLY AND THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION AT THE TIME AND NOT IMPLEMENTED PROCESS IS TO YOU OVER AND EVALUATE THE- EFFECTIVENESS OF AN HSA FUNDED PROGRAMS. INCLUDING THE CLICK THE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES. FUNDING FOR CRISIS WORKERS AT MY COLLEGE COLLEAGUE MENTIONED EARLIER. TURNING TO PAGE TWELVE WE'VE INCLUDED A TABLE THAT INCLUDES ALL THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THIS FEBRUARY AUDIT REPORT. AS WELL AS A LISTING OF SEVERAL DEVELOPMENTS STEPS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN RELATION TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS SINCE THE AUDIT WAS RELEASED. I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THESE ITEMS FIRST THE DEPARTMENT HAS SINCE IMPLEMENTED A PROCESS FOR REVERTING. ON SPENT AN HSA FUNDS. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO PASSED A LAW THAT LIMITS RESERVES FOR COUNTIES 233% OF THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT FUNDING OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. AND THAT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED THE DEPARTMENT ALSO HAS IMPLEMENTED A PROCESS TO WITHHOLD A PORTION OF FUNDING FROM COUNTIES THAT SUBMIT THEIR ANNUAL EXPENSE REPORTS LATE. ON THE A SEASIDE. THE COMMISSION HAS IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL PROCESSES AND TOOLS FOR COUNTIES TO USED TO DEVELOP BETTER INNOVATION PROGRAM APPLICATIONS AND THAT THE COMMISSION HAS ALSO LAUNCHED SEVERAL ANTICIPATED DATA TOOLS THAT PROVIDE PUBLIC FACING INFORMATION ABOUT HOW IMAGES A FUNDS ARE SPENT AND SOME INFORMATION ABOUT OUTCOMES. I'LL CONCLUDE OUR PRESENTATION WITH SOME ADDITIONAL OVER ARCHING ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO KEEP IN MIND IN THIS AREA AND THE FIRST IS THAT STATE OVERSIGHT. OF THE IMAGES SAY REMAINS CHALLENGING. STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO STRENGTHEN STATE OVERSIGHT OVER THIS PROGRAM. BUT MANY OF THE STEPS ARE NOT YET FULLY IMPLEMENTED. AND OTHER CHALLENGES REMAIN FOR EXAMPLE FRAGMENTED OVERSIGHT HAVING OVERSIGHT IN TWO DIFFERENT AGENCIES WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE AN ENHANCED LEVEL OF COORDINATION IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE. ANOTHER ISSUE AT AT AT A HIGH LEVEL IS THAT AND SERVICE COORDINATION ACROSS THE MULTIPLE SYSTEMS OF CARE INVOLVED IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH IS ALSO A CHALLENGE THE IMAGES SAY FUNDED ACTIVITIES THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON TODAY MAKE UP ONLY A PORTION OF THE STATE'S PUBLIC COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. AND IN GENERAL THE SYSTEM IS FRAGMENTED WITH A VARIETY OF OVERLAPPING FUNDING STREAMS AND PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS AND TARGET POPULATIONS. AND ADDITIONALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE NOT WIDELY INTEGRATED WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH SERVICES SO YOU CAN HAVE INDIVIDUALS INTERACTING WITH MULTI PUBLIC SYSTEMS AND COORDINATION AMONG THE SYSTEMS IS DIFFICULT. FINALLY THE M. HSA IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN HOW THEY STRUCTURE OPERATE THEIR SERVICES. THIS FLEXIBILITY ALLOWS FOR LOCAL INNOVATION. AN ADAPTATION BUT CAN POTENTIALLY CONFLICT WITH STATE LEVEL INTEREST IN PROVIDING POLICY DIRECTION AND MORE CONSISTENT SERVICES AND OUTCOMES. SINCE THE IMAGES THEY WAS ENACTED BY VOTER INITIATIVE THERE ARE SOME LIMITATIONS ON WHAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO CHANGE THIS BALANCE HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE CAN AND HAS TAKEN SOME ACTIONS TO PROVIDE INCREASED STATE DIRECTION AND ALSO TO INCREASE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT IS PROVIDED TO COUNTIES. TO PROMOTE BETTER OUTCOMES IN THIS WILL BE CONTINUE TO BE AN IMPORTANT THING FOR THE FOR THE STATE TO DO WITH THAT WILL CONCLUDE OUR PRESENTATION HAVING TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT THIS MATERIAL. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS BEFORE WE HEAR AN UPDATE FROM THE IMAGES SAY OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA. AS WAS NOTED THERE'S BEEN MORE MONEY PUT INTO THE SYSTEM OVER THE LAST HANDFUL OF YEARS AND YET WE STILL SEE MANY ISSUES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN RECTIFIED BUT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE COUNTIES. THAT HAVE HAD THE LARGE RESERVE. AND YOU SAID 33% IS WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID. THAT'S CORRECT LEGISLATION WAS PASSED THAT LIMITS THE RESERVES 233% OF THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF MANY SERVICES AND SUPPORT FUNDING THAT THEY RECEIVE AND YET WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE COUNTIES THAT HAD MUCH MORE THAN THAT. AND NOT ALL NOTE ONE THING MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT A LOT OF THE LARGE BALANCES IN COUNTY ACCOUNTS WERE NOT NECESSARILY IN WHAT IS CONSIDERED THE RESERVE THESE WERE UNSPENT FUNDS THAT WERE. MEANT TO BE SPENT WITHIN OTHER AND COMPONENTS OF THE ACT I THINK PRIMARILY OFTEN WITHIN THE INNOVATION COMPONENT OF THE ACTS OF THAT 5% IS RESERVED SO THESE FUNDS WERE REALLY OUTSIDE OF THE PRUDENT RESERVE AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN REVERTED ACCORDING TO FOR THE THREE OR FIVE YET WELL IT STARKLY WAS A THREE YEAR WINDOW. SO YES SO I DON'T I DON'T HAVE A GOOD SENSE MAYBE OUR MAYBE TOBY CAN HELP US IN TERMS OF HOW WHAT THE PRUDENT RESERVE LEVELS ARE BUT THESE ARE SORT OF SEPARATE TO SOME DEGREE SEPARATE ISSUES. THANK YOU AGAIN TOBY LAYING THE EXACT DIRECTOR OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. SO THE AUDITOR'S REPORT. GENERALLY USE OF THE TERM RESERVE FOR UNSPENT FUND BALANCES AND IT REALLY REFLECTS TO DIFFERENT POTS OF MONEY. ONE IS A FORMAL PRUDENT RESERVE THAT IS IN A SPECIFIED BANK ACCOUNT. THAT CAN ONLY BE TOUCHED UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS. AND THAT PRUDENT RESERVE IS NOT SUBJECT TO REVERSION IT IS INTENDED TO BE A RAINY DAY FUND. RECOGNIZING THAT THIS IS A VOLATILE REVENUE STREAM. THERE HAS BEEN A WIDE VARIATION IN THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS THAT COUNTIES WERE HOLDING IN THEIR PRUDENT RESERVE. I JUST PART ME LEGISLATION WAS PASSED TO BELIEVE LAST YEAR. THAT LIMITED AMOUNT OF FUN TO BE HELD IN A PRUDENT RESERVE TO AS THE LA HAS REPORTED A THIRD OF YOUR AVERAGED CSS FUND. THE VAST BULK OF THE DOLLARS THAT LEGISLATORS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND KIND OF SUPERVISORS HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT ARE FUNDS THAT ARE ON SPENT SORT OF HEALTH AND WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE CASH FLOW OR AN INFORMAL RESERVE. THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS ON THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS THAT CAN BE THAT CAN BE LEFT IN THE ACCOUNT. HOWEVER THERE IS A REQUIREMENT ORIGINALLY THE IMAGE TO SAY SAID COUNTIES HAVE THREE YEARS TO USE THE FUNDS. FOR THE FUNDS SHALL BE RETURNED TO THE STATE FOR REDISTRIBUTION TO OTHER COUNTIES. AS PART OF LEGISLATION IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AB ONE FOURTEEN THE THREE YEAR RULE WAS AMENDED TO BE THREE YEARS FOR MOST COUNTIES FIVE YEARS FOR SMALL COUNTIES. THE ARGUMENT WAS THAT COUNTY STATED MORE TIME TO PLAY SMALLER COUNTIES WHO ARE REQUIRED TO DISTRIBUTE THEIR DOLLARS INTO AT LEAST THREE POTS COMMUNITY SERVICES SUPPORTS PREVENTION OR INTERVENTION AND INNOVATION IN THE ARGUMENT WAS THAT. THEY THEY WOULD NEED MORE TIME TO ACCUMULATE FUNDS TO THE FOR INNOVATION SO THEY COULD INVEST IN SIGNIFICANT PROJECTS. THE DATE AT THAT I'M MY MEMORY IS THAT OF THE UNSPENT FUNDS THAT WEREN'T IN A PRUDENT RESERVE THAT WERE BEYOND THE THREE YEAR LIMITATION ABOUT 57% OF THAT WITH INNOVATION MAYBE SIXTY FIVE BUT CLOSE TO HALF WAS PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION OR COMMUNITY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. SO WE THOUGHT THIS CHALLENGE SORT OF ACROSS THE FIND ACROSS THE COMPONENTS OF THE M. HSA I'M WE ALSO SAW MANY COUNTIES THAT DID NOT HAVE A CHALLENGE AND SPENDING DOWN THERE FUND BALANCE BUT A LARGER PROPORTION OF COUNTIES THAT WERE ACCRUING LARGE FUND BALANCES AND IN THIS SORT OF CASH FLOW RESERVE. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS. A IT DOES BUT IT BUT I GUESS WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IS AND TWENTY JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN ON THE FLOOR OF THE SUDDENLY THERE WAS A BILL THAT WAS BEING MOVE FORWARD THAT IF COUNTY TENANTS SPENT THEIR MONEY THAT IT WOULD GO BACK INTO A POOL OF FUNDING AND THEN THEY STILL COULD REAPPLY FOR IT. I WASN'T NECESSARILY AGAINST THAT IN THE SENSE THAT THEY SHOULD BE USING THEIR FUNDS AND BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT USING THE FUNDS THEY ARE PUTTING THEM INTO DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS. AND EVEN FOR THE AUDITOR AND I'M TALKING ABOUT ORANGE COUNTY IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO FIND OKAY WHY ARE THESE IN DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS AND THEN YOU HAVE INTEREST AND ALL THOSE THINGS. BUT I DIDN'T SUPPORT THAT BILL BECAUSE I FELT THAT AT THAT POINT IT WOULD GIVE COUNTIES WHO HAVEN'T REALLY WANTED TO USE THE FUNDS AND THAT'S A PHILOSOPHY ISSUE OR A POLITICAL ISSUE. THE REASON TO SAY WE'LL SEE NOW THE STATE TOOK THE FUN SO WE CAN'T USE THEM SO I PUSHED FOR US TO NOT PASS THAT YOU REMEMBER THAT. AND IT DIDN'T PASSED SO THEN IF YOU CAN JUST GIVE ME UP TO SPEED AFTER THAT THAT DIDN'T PASSED IN JUNE. AND THEN YOU SAID THAT THERE WAS. AND I SHOULD KNOW THIS BUT I'M COMPLETELY FORGETTING THEN DID YOU SAY WE PASSED ANOTHER BILL AND NOW THAT DOES PUT A THREE TO FIVE YEARS. ON IT. ON USING THE FUNDS YES THANK YOU IT'S A LITTLE BIT HISTORY HERE THAT'S IMPORTANT WHEN THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WAS FIRST IMPLEMENTED. THE FUNDS CAME TO THE STATE'S MENTAL HEALTH FUND MEDICAL SERVICES FUND AND IT SAT THERE AND ACCUMULATED COUNTIES DEVELOPED EXPENDITURE PLANS SUBMITTED THEM TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH. FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL. WHEN THE STATE APPROVED AN EXPENDITURE THEY WOULD IN ESSENCE ALLOCATE THOSE FUNDS TO THE COUNTY AND THAT STARTED THE CLOCK THE THREE O'CLOCK AND THE ARGUMENT WAS THAT YOU HAVE THREE YEARS TO IMPLEMENT YOUR PLAN AND IF YOU FAIL TO IMPLEMENT YOUR PLAN. GIVE THE MONEY BACK MUCH LIKE A GRANT. OVER TIME THERE WERE DELAYS IN THE COUNTY IN IN THE ABILITY OF THE STATE TO ACTUALLY REVIEW AND APPROVE A COUNTY PROPOSAL. AT THE SAME TIME REVENUES WERE ACCUMULATING IN THE STATE FUND THE STATE COULD NOT DISTRIBUTE THE MONEY FAST ENOUGH. THE LEGISLATURE CHANGE THE RULES AND DETERMINED THAT THE FUNDS THAT COME INTO THE STATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUND WOULD NOW BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE COUNTIES. THINK OF THIS AS A DIRECT DEPOSIT SO EVERY MONTHDOLLARS COME IN THEY GET DISTRIBUTED TO THE COUNTIES BASED ON A FORMULA. HI MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES CAN ARTICULATE MORE THAN WHAT THAT FORMULA IS AND HOW THAT WORKS. THE RULES REGARDING REVERSION HAD BEEN WRITTEN. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STATE AUTHORIZING A AN EXPENDITURE AND IN ESSENCE WRITING A CHECK WIN THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZED THE LARGE FUND BALANCES AND MOVED TO A DIRECT DEPOSIT STRATEGY THE REVERSION ROLES WERE NOT UPDATED TO REFLECT THAT AND IT CREATED CONFUSION OVER WIND IT'S THE CLOCK STARTS. AND IT AND WE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE A RIVERS POLICY THAT WAS OUTLINED WITH THE CASH FLOW PROCESS THAT WAS NOW IN PLACE. WHEN THE COMMISSION LOOKED AT THIS WE LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE OF FIRST FISCAL REPORTING BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH FUNDS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED SPENT OR ARE LEFT IN THE BANK WITHOUT ACTUALLY GETTING THE REPORTS AND THAT WAS A PROBLEM AND THE AUDITOR IDENTIFIED THAT AS WELL. AND THEN WE LOOKED AT THE ISSUE OF HOW CAN WE CALCULATE UNSPENT FUNDS WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM. WE KNEW BASED ON A REPORT TO WE DID HAVE THAT THERE WERE FUNDS THAT HAD BEEN SITTING IN COUNTY ACCOUNTS GOING BACK EIGHT YEARS AND SO THE THREE O'CLOCK HAD CLEARLY EXPIRED. YET BUT THE STATE DID NOT HAVE A PROCESS FOR ACTUALLY CALCULATING UNSPENT FUNDS AND CAPS FOR BRINGING THOSE DOLLARS BACK THIS PUT THE COUNTIES IN A PARTICULAR BEHIND. BECAUSE THEY WERE RECEIVING THESE FUNDS ON A DIRECT DEPOSIT BASIS. BUT THEY HADN'T SPENT THE MEN OF THE DEADLINE. THEY WERE THE THERE WAS NO PROCESS THAN TO GIVE THE DOLLARS BACK. SO IF THEY WERE TO SPEND DOLLARS THAT THEY LATER HAD TO RETURN TO THE STATE. THEY WOULD BE STOCK HAVING TO FIND ADDITIONAL REVENUES TO PAY BACK THE STATE SO TO SPEAK. THIS WASN'T THE ONLY REASON BUT IT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE STARTED TO SEE LARGE BALANCES BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE PROCESS IN PLACE TO. SPEND THE MONEY QUICKLY IN SOME INSTANCES BUT ALSO TO REVERT THE DOLLARS AT THE POINT IN TIME THAT REVERSION WAS REQUIRED. THE COMMISSION'S WORK THE AUDITOR'S WORK REALLY FOCUSED ON THE STATE PUTTING IN PLACE THE STRATEGY TO CREATE CLARITY. AROUND WHAT THE RULES ARE HOW MUCH MONEY UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS AND HOW THOSE MONIES COME BACK. I'M I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE BILL AS YOU DESCRIBED IT. BUT THE REVERSION ROLE WAS WRITTEN INTO THE ORIGINAL INITIATIVE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR. AND THERE WAS A BILL TO CREATE A MENTAL HEALTH FOR VERSION FUND AND THE RECOMMENDATION THAT THE COMMISSION HAD MADE WAS THAT ANY REVERTED FUND SHOULD GO INTO THAT FUND FOR THREE REASONS ONE WE WANTED TO CREATE TRANSPARENCY AROUND FUNDS THAT WERE SEPARATE TO REVERSION WE FELT THAT. HIGHLIGHTING THAT THE REALITY OF COUNTIES NOT SPENDING FUNDS WOULD CHANGE BEHAVIOR. WE ALSO THE WHAT THE LAW SAYS IS REVERTED FINDS WILL BE REDISTRIBUTED TO OTHER COUNTIES TO MEET ADDITIONAL NEEDS. IN THE TIME WHEN THE STATE WAS APPROVING COUNTY EXPENDITURE PLANS IN WRITING CHECKS THAT MADE TREMENDOUS SENSE THE MONEY IS NOW BACK IN THE BANK ACCOUNT. AND THAT PROCESS WOULD MOVE FORWARD. CURRENTLY FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH A WAITED FORMULA LARGELY BASED ON POPULATION WE WERE CONCERNED THAT. REVERTED FUNDS WOULD JUST GO BACK INTO THE MAIN POT AND WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED IN SUCH A WAY THAT IF A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THOSE FOR INNOVATION FUNDS THEY WOULD LOSE THE INNOVATION STATUS AND BECOME CORE SERVICES FUNDS AND SO WE FELT THAT THE REDISTRIBUTION SHOULD BE INTENTIONAL RATHER THAN JUST BASED ON A WEIGHTED FORMULA. AND WE RAISE THE ISSUE OF THE LEGISLATURE BEING IDENT BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY KEY STATEWIDE PRIORITIES FOR DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE FUNDS. AGAIN SO THAT IT WAS INTENTIONAL. THE SENATOR BELL HAD A BILL THAT ESTABLISH THE FINE FOR REVERSION BUT IT DID NOT PUT ANY REQUIREMENTS OR DIRECTION ON HOW THE FUNDS WOULD BE USED. SO TO MY KNOWLEDGE THE ANY MONEY THAT IS SUBJECT TO RIVERS AND WOULD SIMPLY BE REDISTRIBUTED. IN THAT FORMULA ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE IS THE INTERPRETATION OF THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE THAT SAYS TWO OTHER COUNTIES SO THAT WOULD MEAN IN THE ORANGE COUNTY CASE. WOULD THEY GET A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR OWN FUNDS BACK OR WHAT THE DEPARTMENT BE REQUIRED TO COME UP WITH A WAITED FORMULA THAT REDISTRIBUTED COUNTIES FUNDING FROM A SINGLE COUNTY TO ALL OF THE OTHER COUNTIES WHICH JUST BECOMES. VERY COMPLICATED OVERTIME. WELL I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS INTERESTING TO ME WAS AT ONE POINT THE ORANGE COUNTY OUR AUDITOR WAS NOTING THAT HE BELIEVES THAT THERE WAS UP TO TWO. BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND- IN RESERVES. WHICH WAS VERY UPSETTING TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY AS WE HAD CONTINUED TO SEE A LARGE NEED TO USE THOSE FUNDS. SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE ISSUES BUT THEN IT WAS A TODD GLORIA BILL I DON'T REMEMBER THE NUMBER. AND HE WAS FRUSTRATED WHICH IS WHY HE BROUGHT IT TO THE FLOOR AND IN ADDITION TO THE COUNTY IS BEING ABLE TO RE APPLY FOR THE FUNDS IF THEY WERE REVERTED. THEY WERE ALSO GOING TO ADD SPECIAL DISTRICTS IN I BELIEVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DIDN'T MOVE FORWARD AND- SO MIKE RATIONALE IN ASKING THESE QUESTIONS IS. THAT YOU WERE RIGHT IN THE SENSE THAT MAKING THIS MUCH MORE TRANSPARENT HAS PUSHED. AT LEAST ORANGE COUNTY AND I'M ASSUMING OTHER COUNTIES IN TO STARTING TO USE THESE FUNDS IN A MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE WAY AND I DO GET. YOU KNOW SAY THEY WANT TO BUILD A MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY IN YOUR USING SOME OF THOSE DOLLARS THAT CAN BE USED THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY JUST TAKE. TWO YEARS OR IT COULD STRETCH AND A THREE TO FIVE BUT THE URGENCY HAS BEEN THERE AND NOW I THINK SOME OF THIS PRESSURE IS FORCING THEM. TO USETHEM AND TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT SO THAT'S A GOOD THING WE JUST WANT TO SEE THE MONEY. FROM THE STATE GET TO THE COUNTY AND THE MUSIC. DIRECTOR EWING I THINK NOT THERE'S A GREAT TIME IF YOU CAN JUST YOU KNOW KIND OF GIVE US AN OVERVIEW AND AN INTERACTION OF THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT. AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION AND THE WORK THAT YOU ALL HAVE BEEN DOING PARTICULARLY IN RESPONSE TO. THE AUDIT AND IN RESPONSE TO SOME THE SAME CONCERNS THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA ANOTHER HAVE RAISED THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY I GUESS WHAT I'D LIKE TO. KIND OF PREFACE MY COMMENTS AROUND THE FISCAL TRANSPARENCY PACE WHICH ALL AUG GET INTO A LITTLE BIT OF DETAIL. WITH QUITE OFTEN WHEN WE PRESENT PUBLICLY ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WE REALLY TRY TO HIGHLIGHT THE POLICY SIDE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDING THE FUNDING IS TREMENDOUS IN IN IN THE OPPORTUNITY THAT IT CREATES. BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PIECES TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT THAT ARE REALLY QUITE UNIQUE AND THAT. ALLOWS CALIFORNIA TO STAND APART FROM THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. ONE IS THE MANDATE FOR PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. OF THE DAY THE MAIL HOW SERVICES ACT RECOGNIZED VERY EARLY ON THAT OUR SYSTEM IS WHAT WE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS A FAIL FIRST SYSTEM. BECAUSE MEDIC HOW AND MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE DIAGNOSIS BASED YOU HAVE TO MEET A LEVEL OF SEVERITY BEFORE YOU'RE ELIGIBLE FOR CARE. WE DON'T DO THIS IN OTHER ASPECTS OF HEALTH CARE WE DON'T DO THIS IN IN IN TERMS OF OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS OR THE OTHER WAYS WHICH WE TRY TO SERVE FAMILIES. BUT SO MUCH OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM HAS BEEN BUILT UPON A SYSTEM THAT. THAT THE LITTLE WHO ARE COMMISSION IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND DESCRIBED AS RATIONING ACCESS TO CARE THAT YOU HAVE TO MEET A LEVEL OF SEVERITY. IF YOU'RE IF YOU IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR SERVICES. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT CREATES A MANDATE FOR PREVENTION WHICH IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL. ANDERSON MORE RECENTLY ENACTED LEGISLATION THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN DIRECTED TO ACTUALLY. DEVELOP A STATEWIDE FRAMEWORK AND STRATEGY AROUND PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. BUT IT'S THE POLICY OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF HOMELESSNESS. UNEMPLOYMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS OF JAIL INVOLVEMENT OF EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGES FACING A CHILLED OUR CHILDREN WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF PREVENTION. EARLY INTERVENTION STRATEGY AND THAT'S THAT THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT CULTURAL SHIFT FOR. MENTAL HEALTH FIELD IN GENERAL BUT CERTAINLY FOR AT THE STATE LOCAL FOR OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR COUNTIES IN TERMS OF HOW WE DELIVER MENTAL HEALTH CARE. THE SECOND PIECE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT THAT THAT ALLOWS US TO STAND APART EVEN MORE AND CREATES TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY IS THE INNOVATION COMPONENT TONIGHT I HAVE TO. RECOGNIZE MY COLLEAGUES IN THE ALLEY WE TRY REALLY HARD TO CREATE THESE VISUALS OF HOW THE MONEY FLOWS AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLEXITY TO IT. THERE IS A 5% SET ASIDE FOR INNOVATION THAT'S RUNNING ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AS THE LA COMMENTED THAT IS THE ONE COMPONENT. TO SPEND THOSE DOLLARS WE ALLOW THOSE DOLLARS TO BE SPENT ACROSS FIVE FISCAL YEARS WHICH MEANS THERE'S FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN PLAY FOR INNOVATION. THE REASON THIS IS SO IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE IT'S THIS VERY EXPLICIT POLICY THAT SAYS WE HAVE TO IMPROVE AND IT IS NOT JUST A TOOL THAT'S ACTUALLY MANDATE COUNTIES ARE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP PROPOSALS TO STRENGTHEN THEIR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS USING THESE INNOVATION DOLLARS. SO I WANT TO I WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE IN THAT THE VALUE OF THE M. HSA. INCLUDES THE FUNDS BUT IT'S THE APPROACH TO DELIVERING CARE THAT REALLY IS THE CRUX OF THE ACT FOCUSED ON RECOVERY. AND WITHIN THE P. E. I. COMPONENT IT OUTLINES SEVEN KEY OUTCOMES THAT WE REALLY NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND WELL BEING NOT ILLNESS RESPONSE AND THAT INCLUDES HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT AVOIDING JAIL INVOLVEMENT. AVOIDING THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM MEANING KEEPING FAMILIES INTACT. AND SO IT IT IT IT ALSO INCLUDES REDUCING SCHOOL FAILURE WOULD LIKE TO SAY SUPPORTING EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS I THINK INCREASINGLY WHILE. THEY CHALLENGE OF HOMELESS MENTALLY ILL FOLKS IS THE FACE OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM FOR ADULTS PLUS OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT WHEN IT COMES TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH. I CANNOT SET FOOT ON A SCHOOL WITHOUT A TEACHER OR PRINCIPAL THEIR PARENTS TALKING TO ME ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH. MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF CHILDREN IN OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR RECOGNIZING THAT THIS YEAR AND PASSING THEM IN THE HOUSE DIDN'T SERVICES ACT WITH FUNDING TO INCENTIVIZE THESE COUNTY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP THIS IS PHENOMENAL. SIDE I'M I WANT TO SORT OF GO INTO THIS CONVERSATION PARTICULARLY FOR THE SECOND PANEL TALKING ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT CREATES. WHAT THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN DOING IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY IT'S REALLY BEEN TRYING TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY THREE TRANSPARENCY AND SO IF YOU'VE BEEN TO OUR WEBSITE RECENTLY GAVE YOU SOME HANDOUTS. WHEN WE FIRST SAW THE CHALLENGES OF ON A LACK OF REPORTING IN UNSPENT FUNDS WE BASICALLY DIGITIZED THE STATE'S REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE REPORTS AND PUT THEM ONLINE AN EASY POINT AND CLICK MANNER AND WHAT WHAT FIRST HAPPENED WAS THERE WAS RECOGNITION. THAT COUNTIES HAD NOT BEEN SUBMITTING THEIR FINANCIAL REPORTS THE SECOND ISSUE THAT CAME UP WERE THE LARGE UNSPENT FUND BALANCES. PUTTING THE DATA OUT THERE I WOULD ARGUE MORE SO THAN THE REVERSION POLICY HAS WHAT IS GENERATED THE CONVERSATIONS IN FACT I RECEIVED A CALL. FROM THE THEN CHAIR OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ASKING ME TO CALM AND EXPLAIN THE DATA BECAUSE THE BOARDS HAD BEEN TO THE LEARNED IT TO THIS AM PROBABLY HALF A DOZEN OTHER. COUNTY SUPERVISORS ACROSS THE STATE CALLED IN AND ASKED US FOR SOME GUIDANCE ON THIS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO MAKE READILY AVAILABLE KEY INFORMATION ON REVENUES EXPENDITURES AND UNSPENT FUNDS. AS A AS A COMPONENT TO THAT WE'RE ALSO MAKING AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING FUNDED. INCLUDED IN THAT IS INFORMATION WHO IS ACTUALLY BEING SERVED WITHIN THE REGULATORY LIMITATIONS OF THE COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY WHICH IS FOCUSED ON INNOVATION MP I ONLY. WE ARE ASKING THE COUNTIES TO ACTUALLY GIVE US DETAILED INFORMATION ON WHO IS SERVED BY RACE ETHNICITY LANGUAGE SPOKEN SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY VETERAN STATUS DISABILITY STATUS WHAT WE WANT IS THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND HOW COUNTIES ARE PRIORITIZING USES OF THESE FUNDS. OUR INTENT IS NOT TO TELL COUNTIES WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES ARE OUR INTENT IS TO SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY PLANNING PROCESS THAT IS REQUIRED UNDER THE LAW. WHICH SAYS GO OUT AND ENGAGE THE PUBLIC TO SHAPE DESIGN AND TAILOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM TO YOUR NEEDS. THE COULD THE COMMISSION SEES THAT STRATEGY HAS PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY RATHER THAN THE SIXTEEN COMMISSIONERS DECIDING WHICH COUNTIES ARE DOING IT RIGHT WHICH KIND OF TO DOING IT WRONG THE IDEA IS TO EMPOWER THE PUBLIC TO ACTUALLY ENGAGE. WE HAVE IN OUR SYSTEM INFORMATION ON FUNDING ON SERVICES AND THE THIRD PIECEIS THE OUTCOMES ACHIEVED. WHEN I TALK TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR FROM GOVERNMENT THEY WANT SYSTEMS THAT WORK. AND WHAT THEY WANT TO KNOW IS ARE WE MAKING SMART DECISIONS WITH HOW WE SPEND MONEY. ARE WE MAKING SMART DECISIONS WITH WHAT WE'RE BUYING THE SERVICES WERE PAYING FOR. AND DO THOSE SERVICES RESULT IN YOUR PEOPLE GOING TO JAIL YOUR PEOPLE HOMELESS LIVING ON THE STREETS MORE PARENTS CAPABLE OF. KEEPING THEIR CHILDREN IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD IN AVOIDING THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM X. AT OUR CENTER. WHAT WE'VE SEEN SINCE THEN IS A TREMENDOUS RESPONSE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THE COUNTIES TO STRENGTHEN FISCAL TRANSPARENCY WHEN WE STARTED. THERE WERE ZERO COUNTIES WERE SUBMITTING THEIR FINANCIAL REPORTS ON TIME SOME COUNTIES HAD SUBMITTED REPORTS IN FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS LOTS OF REASONS FOR THAT. SOME UNDERSTANDABLE MANY OF THEM NOT TODAY I THINK WE'RE AT A 100% REPORTING. RIGHT WE SAW VERY LARGE FUND BALANCES AND LITTLE ATTENTION IN TERMS OF THESE DOLLARS THAT WERE SITTING IN THE BANK ACCOUNTS. I CANNOT GIVE YOU AN UPDATE TODAY ON UNSPENT FUNDS AND I CAN EXPLAIN THAT BUT I CAN TELL YOU ANECDOTALLY THAT. COUNTY AFTER COUNTY IS WORKING HARD TO STREAMLINED HOW THEY SPEND THESE DOLLARS TO PUT MORE PROGRAMS IN PLACE. TO SUPPORT THAT AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THIS MORE ON THE SECOND PANEL. WE HAVE BEEN FACILITATING CROSS COUNTY LEARNING COLLABORATIVE'S WE HAVE BEEN INCENTIVIZING PARTNERSHIPS WE HAVE BEEN SORT OF RAISING THE FLAG AND SAYING HEY WHO'S INTERESTED. AND THE COUNTIES ARE BEING VERY RESPONSIVE BOTH IN TERMS OF THEIR USE OF THEIR OWN DATA. TRYING TO STRENGTHEN THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR OWN DATA TRYING TO STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS GET MORE MONEY OUT. THE TRANSPARENCY HAS HAD THE IMPACT THAT WE HAD HOPED IT WOULD HAVE WHICH WAS MORE CONVERSATION MORE UNDERSTANDING. AND MORE OPENNESS AND WILLINGNESS TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND TRY THINGS WE HAVEN'T TRIED BEFORE. TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT THE AUDIT REYES RELATIVE TO THE COMMISSION AROUND STATEWIDE STANDARDS FOR THE TRIAGE PROGRAM AND CLARIFICATION ON INNOVATIONS WE HAVE A DASHBOARD IN FRONT OF YOU THAT SHOWS THE APPROVAL RATES FOR INNOVATIONS THOSE RATES. AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HIGH I THINK IT WAS A LOT OF MISCOMMUNICATION WITH THE COUNTY IS ABOUT. WHAT INNOVATION MEANS. SOME OF THAT WAS A LACK OF CLARITY ON THE COMMISSION'S PART SOME OF IT WAS JUST THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING THIS INFORMATION OUT TO LOTS AND LOTS OF DIVERSE COUNTIES. SO I THINK WE'VE ADDRESSED THAT ISSUE QUITE. COMPREHENSIVELY ON THE TRIAGE PIECE. WHAT THE AUDITOR WAS SAYING IS WHEN WE FIRST ISSUED TRIAGE FUNDS EACH COUNTY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN INTERNAL EVALUATION. AND SO THERE WAS NOT A STATE WIDE PICTURE OF THE DOLLARS BECAUSE THE PICTURE WAS INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES. AND WE HAVE MOVED TOWARDS A STATE LEVEL EVALUATION SO WE CAN TELL A MORE BROAD PICTURE WE LOSE THE NUANCE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN AN INDIVIDUAL COUNTY BUT WE GAIN A BROADER PERSPECTIVE AND- WE HAVE A CONTRACT IN PLACE WITH UCLA AND UC DAVIS. TO SUPPORT A STATEWIDE EVALUATION FOR THE TRIAGE DOLLARS SO WHAT WE ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES WITH THAT BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH DIVERSITY AND HOW THOSE FUNDS HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED. IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO COME UP WITH A SINGLE PICTURE OF HOW THAT IT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED BUT THAT'S THAT'S MY IN AND THERE'S A REPORT IN YOUR PACKET THAT IS THAT REPORT ON THE TRIAGE FUNDS AND- I THINK WE'VE SATISFIED THE AUDITOR THAT. WE'VE MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND GET INTO THE DETAIL OF WHY WE CAN'T TELL YOU THE UPDATE. IN TERMS OF WHAT THE RESERVE BALANCES ARE IT BUT I'M ALSO WOULD JUST LIKE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. AT THE I WOULD LIKE AN UPDATE ON THAT BEFORE WE DIVE INTO THAT. AS YOU SAID PEOPLE KNOW THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN I WHEN I BELIEVE THEY WANT TO THINK THAT WE ARE SPENDING THIS MONEY. SMARTLY I'M PROGRAMS THAT ARE WORKING SO WELL MAKING SURE THE MONEY IS ACTUALLY GETTING SPENT CURLY ENTER IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. RIGHT ARE YOU SPENDING THE MONEY IS NOT THE HARD PART. IT'S GETTING RESULTS SO WHAT ARE WE DOING EITHER YOUR OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE OR OR SOME OTHER BODY. HOW ARE WE TRACKING OUTCOMES AND HOW ARE WE IDENTIFYING BEST PRACTICES RIGHT ONE OF THE QUESTION. LET ME ADD ONE LITTLE PIECE ON THE MONEY AND I DON'T HAVE THE CALCULATION EXACTLY BUT- IF YOU COMPARE THE FUNDS THAT SAT IN THE BANK ACCOUNTS. STATEWIDE AT THAT POINT IN TIME WITH THE FUNDS THAT WERE GENERATED BY THE ACTS. IT'S A VERY IT'S A LOT OF MONEY BUT IT'S A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE THE VAST MAJORITY OF AN HSA DOLLARS ARE GETTING OUT THERE BEING SPENT THERE BEING SPENT QUICKLY. I THINK YOU'RE ASKING THE MORE PERTINENT QUESTION NOT IS ARE WE ACTUALLY GETTING THE JOB DONE BECAUSE WHAT WE SEE EVERYDAY IS MORE MORE PEOPLE ON THE STREET. MORE MORE PEOPLE IN OUR JAILS MORE AND MORE CHILDREN STRUGGLING THE SUICIDE RATES THAT YOU THAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS. HERE'S A WE'RE TRYING TO DO. CLICK THE CAN I AND I PRESENTED IN. MANY BUDGET COMMITTEES IN THE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS THAT JUST CLOSED RECENTLY WE REALLY HAVE THIS FOUR PRONG STRATEGY THE FIRST IS ABOUT DATA. SO ON OUR WEBSITE WE HAVE ONE INDICATOR OF OUTCOMES ASSOCIATE WITH FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ANALYZE THE DATA THAT THE STATE HAS AVAILABLE WE'RE WE'RE NOT INVESTING IN YOU KNOW ALL NEW DATA SYSTEMS HAS A VERY EXPENSIVE WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO IS TAKE EXISTING ADMINISTRATIVE DATA AND LINK IT SO WE HAVE LINKED. DATA FROM THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES WITH DATA FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO LOOK AT CRIMINAL JUSTICE RATES AND WE'RE NOW WORKING TO UNDERSTAND THE SERVICE DELIVERY SO IT'S NOT CHEST WHO'S IN THIS YOU KNOW WHO IS IN A COMMITMENT A WHOLE SYSTEM NOW WHO'S IN JAIL WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED IN THE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND WHICH OF THOSE INTERVENTIONS HAD AN OUTCOME. OF AVOIDING JAIL RIGHT WE'RE NOT THERE YET. I I'LL SHARE WITH YOU THAT THIS IS NOT COMMON PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND AND- SIMPLY TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. I WAS INVOLVED WITH THE DRAFTING THE LEGISLATION TO CREATE CALIFORNIA'S COUNSELING MILLION OFFENDERS WHICH IS NOW THE COUNSEL IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND WE AND LIST I WAS OF LITTLE WHO WERE AT THE TIME WE ENLISTED UC BERKELEY TO DO THAT DATALINK. AND IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WE PUBLISHED THAT IT IS FEASIBLE TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT YOUR MENTAL HEALTH DATA. IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA AND UNDERSTAND WHAT KINDS OF SERVICES DIVERT PEOPLE TO PREVENT. TYPICALLY RE INVOLVEMENT BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING WITH THE POPULATION THAT IS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM INITIALLY. TEN YEARS LATER THE COMMISSION IS NOW DOING THIS AGAIN TRYING TO STAND THAT UP. WE ARE WORKING TO LINK MENTAL HEALTH DATA TO EMPLOYMENT DATA. THE LEGISLATURE GAVE US THE AUTHORITY TO WORK WITH EDT TO ACCESS EMPLOYMENT DATA BECAUSE REDUCING UNEMPLOYMENT AS ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION LANGUAGE OF THE ACT. WE ARE SITTING DOWN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND THE INTERSECTION OF COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH AND OUR SCHOOLS AND DESIGN PARTNERSHIPS. TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN BUT ALSO LOOK AT THE DATA ACROSS THE SYSTEM'S VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE THEIR DATA IS PROTECTED UNDER CERTAIN FEDERAL RULES THE MEN HOT THAT AFFECTS UNDER SEPARATE FEDERAL RULES THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE OPEN THEIR WORKING WITH US WERE ROLLING UP OUR SLEEVES WE WANT TO DO THE SAME THING WITH CHILD WELFARE INVOLVEMENT. HOMELESSNESS IS MORE DIFFICULT WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD ADMINISTRATIVE DATABASE THAT HAS IDENTIFIERS THAT YOU CAN LINK. BUT DURING THE DAY TO WORK IS JUST THE FIRST PIECE IT MEANS WE ARE GOING TO IDENTIFY CHALLENGES. AND IN NEW YOU TAKE OFF THE CHALLENGES WE WANT TO GET MUCH MORE GRANULAR INTO WHAT THOSE CHALLENGES ARE AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. WE THEN WANT TO BE ABLE TO COME ALONG AND SUPPORT IMPROVEMENT SAID THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY. MOVING COUNTIES TOWARDS BEST PRACTICES AND FOR US THAT MEANS THE STATE NEEDS TO PUT IN PLACE A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE STRATEGY WHICH S NOT AS ROBUST AS IT COULD BE TODAY. WHICH MEANS THE STATE NEEDS TO DEVELOP OPPORTUNITIES TO INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES. LAST YEAR WE RECEIVED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS O SUPPORT WHAT WE'RE CALLING IN INNOVATION INCUBATOR. RATHER THAN IN ESSENCE SIGN THE CHECK FOR A PLAN THAT THE COUNTY WROTE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WORK WITH THE COUNTY TO STRENGTHEN THE INNOVATION COMPONENT WE WANT TO USE THE DATA TO IDENTIFY KEY OPPORTUNITIES THAT NEED TO BE IMPROVED. AND THEN BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE COULD USE INNOVATION DOLLARS TO STRENGTHEN CORE PROGRAMMING TO MEET THOSE GOALS THE INTENT IS NOT FOR THE COMMISSION TO TELL THE COUNTIES WHAT TO FUND THE INTENT IS TO SUPPORT BRINGING COUNTIES TOGETHER WHO HAVE SHARED CHALLENGES WHERE WEAKENED SUBSIDIZE THAT CROSS COUNTY CONVERSATION. THAT IS MUCH EASIER THAN HALF ASKING EACH COUNTY TO WRITE A CHECK FOR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS SO YOU CAN GET PEOPLE IN A ROOM. THEY CAN'T SUBSIDIZE EACH OTHER. WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. IN OUR BUDGET LAST YEAR TO LAUNCH THREE COLLABORATIVE INNOVATION PROJECTS. ONE IS FOCUSING ON STRENGTHENING FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS WHICH ARE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF COMMUNITY BASED CARE. AND OUR DATA SHOWING THAT ABOUT 40% OF PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THIS PROGRAMS ARE NOT MEETING GOALS. THE COUNTIES ARE CO INVESTING WITH US THEY'VE RACED PHILANTHROPY PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS AS WELL WE HAVE EIGHTEEN COUNTIES COMING TOGETHER TO LEARN. HOW TO BETTER ANALYZE THEIR OWN DATA HOW TO STRENGTHEN THEIR CONTRACTING WITH THEIR COMMUNITY PROVIDERS AND HOW TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO STRENGTH THAT TO ACHIEVE THE OUTCOMES OF THAT LAW. WE HAVE A GROUP OF FIVE COUNTIES WORKING TO ANALYZE THEIR OWN CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND MENTAL HEALTH DATA ALONG. THE LINES OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE THEY HAVE MUCH MORE DETAILED DATA. AND WE HAVE A MULTI COUNTY PROJECT TO USE PSYCHIATRIC ADVANCE DIRECTIVES AS A WAY TO AVOID THE NEED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT BASED CRISIS CARE. WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR WILL ENGAGE THE COUNTIES. THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WE RECEIVED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET REALLY THAT WAS FOR. WE ARE REQUIRED TO FOCUS ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT. WE SEE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO FACILITATE HOW COUNTIES CAN LEARN TOGETHER AND IMPROVE THEIR SYSTEMS WITHOUT ACTUALLY DIRECTING THEM SAID BEYOND THAT THAT THE LOCAL PRIORITIES THAT ARE THAT. THE VISION OF REALIGNMENT THE THIRD PIECE IS INCENTIVES AND SO MANY OF THE FUNDS THAT YOU PROVIDED US THIS YEAR ON THE SCHOOL MENTAL THESE DIDN'T KNOW HOW SERVICES ACT EARLY PSYCHOSIS FUNDS AND YOUTH DROP IN CENTERS PLUS THE DATA ARE WHAT WE VIEW AS INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE COUNTIES TO ROLL UP THEIR SLEEVES IN MY EARLIER COMMENTS ABOUT HOW RESPONSIVE THE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN. WE'VE HAD A TREMENDOUS RESPONSE FROM COUNTIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE WHO HAVE BEEN VERY APPRECIATIVE THAT WE BOTH RECOGNIZE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THEM TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT WE ALL EXPECT OF THEM. AND THAT THE KIND OF PARTNERSHIP THAT WERE ENVISIONING WITH STATE IS VERY WELCOME IN PART BECAUSE ALL ALL QUOTE THE NORTH COUNTIES THAT SAID THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE CONSULTANTS THEY DON'T HAVE THE BAND WITH OR THE TIME OF THE STAFF. TO ROLL UP THEIR SLEEVES ANALYZE THE DATA. EXPLORE THE WORLD TO LOOK FOR BEST PRACTICES AND THEN TO FIND THE FOLKS WHO CAN HELP THEM IMPLEMENT THEM. AND IF WE CAN OPEN SOME OF THOSE DOORS FOR THEM OR SUPPORT THEIR PEER COUNTIES TO DO THAT THEN THEY CAN BENEFIT AND OTHER COUNTIES LIKE THAT CAN BENEFIT. SO IN THAT'S OUR YOU KNOW OUR OUR BROAD STRATEGY REALLY IS THE DATA AND THEN SUPPORT SUPPORT SUPPORT SUPPORT. I THINK WE'VE GOT SOME OTHER QUESTIONS AT CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR FIRM TO THE LA AND YOU AS WELL FOR SOME REALLY GOOD INFORMATION. COUPLE QUESTIONS TONIGHT. I'M I'M GONNA I'M- THIS IS BY SAYING YOU KINDA ANSWERED THIS BUT IT IS I THEY OBVIOUSLY WERE LACKING DATA AND THAT IS A HUGE HUGE CHALLAN SO FOR ME. IN THE FIVE COUNTIES I REPRESENT RURAL COUNTIES. WE GET IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WE ABOUT THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL. FROM ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR TRINITY COUNTY TO TWENTY MILLION TWENTY ONE MILLION FOR CINEMA COUNTY. CURRENTLY DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THERE'S ANY WAY TO DETERMINE. HOW THIS MONEY WAS SPENT ON THE PROGRAM ON INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS IF THERE IS THEN I'D LOVE TO KNOW HOW WE CAN DO TO DO THAT HOW MUCH MONEY WAS SPENT ON INNOVATION HOW MUCH MONEY WAS SPENT ON P. E. I HOW MUCH MONEY WAS SPENT ON WET. AND SO WE CAN SEE THAT I'M REALLY HAPPY TO HEAR ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN AT LEAST FOR THE COUNTIES I HAVE ROLLING UP THEIR SLEEVES AND TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE SO. ONE QUESTION IS HAVE YOU CONSIDERED SORT OF REGIONAL COLLABORATIVE'S WARS WERE SMALLER GROUPS A COUNTIES COULD ACTUALLY WORK TOGETHER TO FIGURE FIGURE SOME OF THIS OUT BECAUSE. YOU KNOW CLEARLY TRINITY COUNTY IN A TRAINING COUNTY IS NOT LA. NOT EVEN CLOSE THE MAIN AND SO THE CHALLENGES ARE DIFFERENT AND SO THE ONE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH IS ARE JUST A DISASTER FOR SMALLER COUNTIES SO HAVE YOU CONSIDERED ANY SORT OF REGIONAL REGIONAL COLLABORATIVE'S WERE YOU CAN BRING COUNTIES TOGETHER. THAT CAN LEARN NOT LEARN TOGETHER LEARN FROM THAT ABSOLUTELY AND LET ME ANSWER THE ENEMY CAN COMMENT ON YOUR FIRST QUESTION ABOUT BEING ABLE TO FIND WHAT'S BEEN THE ANTENNA BUT RIGHT. SO. ON THE FISCAL TRANSPARENCY TOLD WE HAVE ONLINE RIGHT NOW YOU CANCLICK ON FIVE FISCAL YEARS. ALL OF THE COUNTIES AND THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS THE WET FUNDS ARE NOT BROKEN OUT BUT THE S. S. P. E. I'D INVASION ARE BROKEN OUT AND YOU COULD SEE. HOW MUCH MONEY THEY RECEIVED WHAT THEY SPENT AND WHAT THEY HAD LEFT IN THAT ACCOUNT AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR AND THERE'S A CUMULATIVE TOTAL OKAY SO WEIRD. SOYES WE WANT TO GET THERE THAT IS PART OF THE CHALLENGE OF UPDATING THAT THAT THE RULES AROUND HOW COUNTIES REPORT THOSE DOLLARS THAT WHOLE PROCESS HAVE CHANGED FROM LAST YEAR TO THIS YEAR. AND SO ALTHOUGH SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FIGURES ARE AVAILABLE THEY WERE CÃ¡C THAT UNDER A DIFFERENT METHODOLOGY. AND SO THE HISTORICAL BASE TO CALCULATE THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FUND HAS CHANGED. AND SO WE ARE WE HAVE NOT. PUT THAT INFORMATION ONLINE BECAUSE WE SORT OF DONE APPLES FOR TEN YEARS AND THERE'S AN ORANGE NOW. AND WE WANT TO IN AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY OF THAT. WE'RE JUST NOT THERE YET. IN ADDITION TO THAT OF THE PROGRAM REPORTING TOOL AND THERE'S A HAND OUT IN HERE ON YOUR WEBSITE ON OUR WEBSITE. IT ACTUALLY ALLOWS YOU TO DO A SEARCH OF THIS IS BASED ON THE COUNTY THREE YEAR PLANS. THERE ARE. A COUPLE THOUSAND PROGRAMS IN THERE AND IT IS A PLAN IT'S NOT WHAT THEY DID IT SORT OF HOW THEY'RE MOVING FORWARD MANY THOSE PROGRAMS ARE HISTORICAL PROGRAMS OVER TIME. THIS WILL BE. EXPANDED ITS COUNTIES GIVE US MORE INFORMATION THERE IS IN HERE. SPACE AT LEAST AND WHILE THE DATA COMES IN FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM IN THE BUDGET FOR THE PROGRAM. AND THAT'S WHERE REPORTING ON WHO YOU'VE SERVE WOULD BE ADDED AND SO THE IDEA IS IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHICH PROGRAMS SERVE VETERANS IN YOUR COUNTY YOU CAN CLICK ON. YOUR COUNTY TYPE IN VETERANS IT'LL TELL YOU YOUR BILL TO TELL HOW MUCH FUNDS WENT TO A PROGRAM YOU KNOW VETERANS AN INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS BUT THERE WAS A PROGRAM THAT WAS TARGETED. TOWARDS VETERANS YOU COULD FIND IT SO WE ABSOLUTELY ARE WORKING TO INCLUDE THE BUDGET INFORMATION. I WILL ADD THAT AS THE LA SO ELOQUENTLY POINTED ME TO SAY IS WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE OTHER IS THAT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COUNTY SENATE ARMED HEALTHCARE SERVICES THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A VERY CLEAR VALID RELIABLE ASSESSMENT OF ALL OF THE DOLLARS ALL OF THE SERVICES AND THEN A FULLER AND OUTCOMES. TO GET THERE ON THE OUTCOMES PACE WE ABSOLUTELY ARE ENCOURAGING REGIONAL APPROACHES. IN SOME TYPICALLY WHAT WE DO IS WE SAY HEY WHO'S INTERESTED SOMETIMES THOSE COUNTIES ARE CO LOCATED AND IT IS A REGIONAL IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE THAT I THINK YOU INTENDED. SOMETIMES IT'S SISKIYOU IN LA AND SAN DIEGO IN TRINITY. AND SO WE ARE WE DON'T PICK PARTICIPANTS WHAT WE SAY IS WHO'S INTERESTED AND WE REALLY TRY TO WORK WHERE THERE IS INTEREST. IN BE RESPONSIVE AND TYPICALLY WHAT WE SAY IS WELL WHAT ARE YOU INTERESTED IN DOING AND HOW CAN WE HELP YOU RATHER THAN SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE WANT DONE. YOU KNOW USE THESE DOLLARS TO GO DO IT OUR WAY AND SO IT IS A ACROSS COUNTY COLLABORATIVE BUT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT HAND PICKING. WE ARE HAVING FOLKS STEP UP IT'S NOT ALWAYS IN THE TRADITIONAL GEOGRAPHIC. AT TERM I THINK OF WHAT YOU MEN OF REGIONAL. THE REASON WE WANT CROSS COUNTY ENGAGEMENT. AS WE WANT TO AVOID WHAT I MIGHT CALL THE MENDOCINO MIRACLE. OF MENDOCINO DOING SOMETHING PHENOMENAL AND NO ONE ELSE TRIES BECAUSE IT'S THE WATER OR THE CLEAN AIR OR YOU KNOW SORT OF THE NATURE OF THE COMMUNITY. AND THAT BEST PRACTICE NEVER EXTENDS BEYOND THE COUNTY BORDER. WE ASK THAT THERE BE AT LEAST TWO OR THREE IDEALLY FIVE TO EIGHT COUNTY THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN THESE COLLABORATIVE'S THE IDEA IS THAT IF IT WORKS. IT'S EASIER TO GET TO THAT TIPPING POINT OF EVERYBODY PICKING IT UP BECAUSE IT WAS DONE IN LA AND INFINITY. THE OTHER REASON WE DO IT IS WE WANT THE STATE TO BE RESPONSIVE WHAT THE COUNTIES ARE TELLING US IS THAT INNOVATION ISN'T JUST ABOUT COUNTIES CHANGING THEIR BEHAVIOR IT ALSO MUST INCLUDE THE STATE CHANGING ITS BEHAVIOR. AND SO IF WE CAN HAVE A CRITICAL MASS OF COUNTIES. WE BELIEVE IF THEY'RE COMING TO THE STATE ASKING FOR REFINEMENT OF A REGULATION OR RULE OR A STATUTE THAT THE STATE WILL BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO THAT REQUEST IF IT'S EIGHT COUNTIES THEN IF IT'S TRINITY ALONE. AND SO VERY MUCH CHAIRMAN WOULD WE ARE WORKING TO CREATE THOSE COLLABORATIVE'S. THANK YOU. CUT ONE FINAL QUESTION. SO TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS REALIGNMENT MONEY. IS THIS WORKING. I MEAN THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION FOR YOU GUYS BUT. HOW MUCH DID WE SEE THAT A SPEND. AS A STATE BEFORE. IS THE MONEY IS AT COMPARABLE. AND DO COUNTIES HAVE. THE TOOLS. F. AT THE BILL'S LIKE INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS THAT THE STATE HAD BEFORE REALIGNMENT. SO. I HEAR ALL THE TIME REALIGNMENTS KILLING US WHERE IT'S NOT WORKING YOU KNOW AND IT'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT. THINGS RIGHT. IT'S A TOUGH QUESTION. IS IT WORKING TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS A LOT OF MONEY. I APPRECIATE YOU SAVING THE EASY QUESTION FOR THE LA OUT. HER I'M OF THE ANYBODY WANTS IT TO CRACK IT YOU KNOW SO I I'LL SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS. I'M YES AND NOW RIGHT I MEAN YOU KNOW THE NO ANSWER DO YOU OPENED RIGHT. AT THE SAME TIME WE SEE INCREDIBLE STRENGTH IN WHAT COUNTIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH THE FLEXIBILITY IN THE STRUCTURE REALIGNMENT I THINK OUR ARGUMENT IS THAT WITHIN THE DESIGN OF REALIGNMENT THIS SYSTEM CAN WORK MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN IS WORKING TODAY WHAT'S MISSING IS THE STRATEGY TO ACTUALLY GO FROM HERE'S THE DOLLARS GO DO GOOD WORK TO WHAT WE ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET DONE WE DON'T HAVE CLARITY ON THAT. YOU KNOW IN MY OUT REACH AND SPEAKING I OFTEN WILL COMMENT THAT I WAS THE LOOK TO WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH MEASLES BECAUSE IT IS A CURRENT ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA IN THAT WE HAVE A VERY CLEAR SENSE OF WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO GET DONE IN TERMS OF IMMUNIZATIONS AGAINST MEASLES WE KNOW WHERE THE GAPS ARE. AND WE KNOW THE STRATEGIES USED TO FILL THOSE GAPS. AND IN THE MEASLES CONVERSATION. OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS DON'T SAY MY JOB IS TO GET MEASLES SHOT FOR PEOPLE ON MEDICARE AL. THEY SAY IF WE'RE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL. MY JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY CHILD EVERY ADULT WHO CAN RECEIVE THE VACCINE RECEIVE THE VACCINE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS. WE DON'T HAVE COMPARABLE GOALS IN MENTAL HEALTH WE DON'T HAVE AGREEMENT ON WHAT IT IS WE ARE TRYING TO GET DONE MY EARLIER COMMENTS ABOUT PREVENTION. THERE'S ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR DEDICATED TO PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION WE DON'T YET HAVE AGREEMENT ON WHAT THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF MENTAL HEALTH I WAS TALKING TODAY YESTERDAY. WITH WE HAVE A FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIST WHO IS ACTUALLY IN THE ROOM BACK HERE HIS SPENDING SOME TIME WITH US AS A POLICY FELLOW. AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE TRAINING THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR THE FOLKS WHO ARE IN THAT FIELD AROUND PREVENTION MENTAL IN IN TERMS OF PREVENTING MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. AND IT'S THAT'S RIGHT THERE YOU GO RIGHT. IT'S NOT HAPPENING SO. I THINK. THE PROBLEM ISN'T. REALIGNMENT I MEAN I THINK IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO REVISIT THAT ABSOLUTELY THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE COULD PROBABLY STRENGTH AND THAT. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. WITHIN THE CONTEXT HOW TO CONSTRUCT OF REALIGNMENT WE HAVE NOT REALLY ESTABLISHED AGREED GOALS FOR MENTAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH CARE. WE AREN'T LEVERAGING THE DATA WE HAVE IT IS VERY DIFFICULT IT TAKES US SOMETIMES TWO TO THREE YEARS TO NEGOTIATE A DATA USE AGREEMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN ORDER TO LOOK AT THEIR DATA. AND THEN WHEN WE DO LOOK AT THEIR DATA AND WE FIND THESE CHALLENGES WE THAN WE THAN SAY OR THE COUNTIES SAY. NOW WHAT. AND THE TOOLS WE HAVE ARE VERY LIMITED. AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT WHAT WE- REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON IS STRENGTH IN THIS STRENGTHENING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS THOSE TOOLS AND THE STRATEGIES SO THAT SO THAT COUNTIES HAVE A CLEAR SENSE. OF HOW TO GET TO THE GOALS THAT ARE AGREED UPON. ANOTHER QUESTION THE LA ONCE A CRACK ABOUT. DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. NOT NOT NOT ALLOWED TO ADD A I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT LOCAL FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTATION IN THE ABILITY TO COORDINATE ACROSS PROGRAMS THAT ARE OPERATE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ARE IMPORTANT FEATURES A REALIGNMENT GIVEN THE SIZE AND VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EXIST IN THE STATE. SO THERE DEFINITELY ARE BENEFITS THAT ARE THAT ARE IN THAT SYSTEM AT THE SAME TIME AS IT'S BEEN NOTED ON A COUPLE OF PLACES SO FAR TODAY AND THERE IS A NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND PROVIDING THAT GUIDANCE. AND ADDITIONALLY ONE ASPECT A REALIGNMENT THAT PERHAPS HASN'T BEEN FULLY REALIZED IS LOOKING AT OUTCOMES AND THAT OBVIOUSLY IS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT THING TO DO BUT A LOT COULD BE DONE TO INCREASE THE REPORTING OF INFORMATION UP TO THE STATE LEVEL TO REALLY ASSESS. WHETHER IT'S WORKING OR NOT. AND I AND I WOULD THAT LOOK AT THAT THE IDEA OF THE QUESTION WAS NOT. THIS IS HER TO THROW A BOMB YOU ANSWERED. WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AND I APPRECIATE THAT BOTH OF YOU ANSWER WEB LOOKING FOR. LIKE A LOT OF COUNTIES HAVE FELT. OVERWHELMED BY THE RESPONSIBILITY THEY NOW HAVE AND SO. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PART OF THAT BECOMES A REAL CHALLENGE ESPECIALLY FOR SMALLER CAN EVEN THE LARGER COUNTIES BECAUSE- NOW. YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES AND NOW YOU HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY. AND I THINK IT'S PRETTY OVERWHELMING AND ABSOLUTELY WHEN YOU ADD ALL THE OTHER THINGS IN THEIR LACK OF WORK FORCE AND ALL THESE OTHER FACTORS. IT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF CRIME AND WE'RE REALLY STRUGGLING. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. BEING A LITTLE TALKIE TODAY BUT THIS IS THE JUST SUCH A HUGE ISSUE THAT I THINK INCOME VINCE'S MUCH MORE AREAS THAN WE REALLY BELIEVE IT DOES SO ALWAYS GLAD TO HEAR YOU TALK ABOUT THE STUDENT SERVICES. BUT I MY HOPE IS WITH THE STUDENT SERVICES DISCUSSION IS THAT WE ENROLLED THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS PARTICULARLY IS SUPERINTENDENTS AND PRINCIPALS. TO REALLY START TO UNDERSTAND THESE ISSUES FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE. MUCH MORE THAN THEY DO AND AS WE SAY THAT WE HAVE ONE INSTITUTION TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND THEN OTHER STUFF THAT DURING TALKS OF CRIMINAL. JUSTICE TALKS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE YOU OF EDUCATORS TALKING EDUCATORS MENTAL HEALTH TALKING AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT CROSS DIALOGUE BUT THERE'S THINGS THAT HAPPEN AND VERY VERY YOUNG AGE FOR. CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THAT AS YOU SAID ARE JUST NOT EVEN AND DRESSED IN THE SCHOOLS AND MANY TIMES SCHOOLS ARE WE'RE HERE FOR EDUCATION ACADEMICS. NOT REALIZING THAT IF YOU CAN WORK ON THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE MUCH MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCCESS ACADEMICALLY AND AS A TEACHER FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS ALWAYS I JUST DISTINCTIVELY REMEMBER LOOKING AT. WELL FIRST GREATER LOOKING UP AT ME AND HE HAD A BIG ABSCESS IN HIS TOOTH SO THAT'S ACTUALLY A HEALTH ISSUE BUT IF YOU CAN GET THAT TAKEN CARE OF. THAT'S GOING TO GO A LONG WAY TO. ADDRESS OTHER ISSUES WHETHER IT BE EYE GLASSES AND ALL OF THESE TYPE OF THINGS BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. WE HAVE A VERY PUNISHING. KIND OF SOCIETY WHEN IT COMES TO BEHAVIOR BY CHILDREN AND WE JUST HAD A BILL YESTERDAY. I BELIEVE ON THE FLOOR A FEW DAYS AGO. ABOUT NOT EXPELLING OR SUSPENDING KIDS UNDER FIVE I THINK IT WAS AND- YOU KNOW THAT WE EVEN GO THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE FOR KID THAT ARE FOUR AND FIVE. IT JUST SEEMS OUTRAGEOUS I REACH FOR MY OWN KIDS AND YOU KNOW ALONG WITH ALL THE STUDENTS THAT I'VE HAD AND YES YOU CAN GET FRUSTRATED ALL BUT THERE'S SO MANY THINGS YOU CAN DO. BUT AGAIN I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK AT SOME POINT BECAUSE I MEAN KIDS GET BUT YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S SUSPENDED OR THEY GO TO DETENTION ALL THESE THINGS WE HEARD DECADES AGO THEY'RE STILL DOING SO IF YOU. IF YOU PUT A STUDENT AND DETENTION AND THEY'RE SITTING THERE FOR AN HOUR OR WHATEVER AMOUNT OF TIME. AND THEY'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING HOW IS THAT PRODUCTIVE SO ARE THERE WAYS TO BRING IN UP. INNOVATIVE PRACTICES WHETHER THEY BE YOGA OR OR VARIOUS TYPE OF ACTIVITIES THAT YES THERE REMOVED. BUT THEY'RE NOT PUNISH WHERE IT JUST BECOMES WELL WHY DO I EVEN CARE I WORKED IN A- JUNIOR HIGH WHERE I WAS DOING A LUNCH PROGRAM AND IT WAS KIND OF DETENTION STUFF BUT I THOUGHT I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT. I'M GONNA CREATE LIKE WE CALLED IT A LUNCH BUNCH IN AND BROUGHT IN SPEAKERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AND I ASKED THE KIDS WHO KINDA REPEATEDLY CAME. WHICH THEY'RE USUALLY THE SAME KIDS AND THE KIDS FROM KINDERGARTEN AND THEY SAID I DON'T CARE. YOU KNOW I SO WILL YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. BUT I DON'T CARE WHY SHOULD EVEN BE HERE BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAD. IN THEIR MINDS OF FELT THAT THEY WERE JUST NOT CONNECTED NOT ENGAGED SO WITH THAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE AND I SAY SUPERINTENDENTS AND PRINCIPALS. BECAUSE YES YOU CAN TALK TO THE TEACHERS BUT THE PRINCIPALS AND SUPERINTENDENTS ARE THE ONES THAT IMPLEMENT THE POLICY. AND MAKE IT A PRIORITY SO IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO COME TO CAMPUS AND TALK ABOUT SOME NEW INNOVATION IF THEY CAN'T EVEN GET IN THE DOOR. THERE IT IS IT'S GOING TO GO NO WHERE AND SO THOSE ARE SOME PARTNERSHIPS THAT I THINK THAT COULD BE REALLY HUGE TELEHEALTH I HAD A BILL LAST YEAR. TO START TO SET THE STAGE FOR TELEHEALTH IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS NOW I GOT SIGNED BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S- ANYTHING IS HAPPENING SO THAT'S ANOTHER. QUESTION BUT BECAUSE OF ALL THE ACTIVE SHOOTING ALL THESE TYPE OF THINGS STUDENTS A LOT OF TIMES CAMPUSES WILL SAY WELL WE'RE BRINGING PROFESSIONALS ON THE CAMPUS LIKE. THE DAY AFTER THE WEEK AFTER AND YOU KNOW YOU MAY HAVE TEN STUDENTS THAT GO MAYBE OF A HUNDRED BUT IT'S IMMEDIATELY AFTER. AND WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF THESE ISSUES THAT KIND OF SUSTAIN FROM DRAMATIC EVENTS. CAN SHOW UP SIX MONTHS LATER A YEAR LATER SO THAT AYE TELEHEALTH. THEY COULD IF THEY FOR FEELING ANXIETY COULD GO LOG IN AT SCHOOL. HAVE SOME TYPE OF ADMINISTRATOR BUT THAT YOU HAVE A TELE HEALTH PERSN RIGHT THERE. SO I APPRECIATE THAT. LAST YEAR AT TWO YEARS AGO THE COMMISSION. IT SHOULD AN RFP TO SEE THAT USING SB EIGHTY TO TRIAGE FUNDS SAYING THAT COUNTY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO THE FOR THESE FUNDS BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SCHOOL PARTNER. AND ABOUT 30% ABOUT A THIRD OF THE COUNTIES RESPONDED I MEAN MANY CALLED AND SAID THAT LOVE TO DO THIS BUT I DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY. I THINK THERE IS TREMENDOUS RECOGNITION ON THE PART OF THE COUNTIES IN THE SCHOOLS THAT WE NEED TO DO THIS. THE CHALLENGE AND THINK THIS GETS BACK TO THE QUESTION THAT THAT WITH RAISED EARLIER THERE ARE BEST PRACTICES ALL AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THEY'RE IN POCKETS. RIGHT THERE ARE COUNTIES THAT HAVE BEEN PARTNERING WITH THEIR SCHOOLS ALAMEDA COUNTY FOR YEARS. THEY THROUGH PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION STRATEGIES I HAVE YET TO TALK TO A COUNTY HIS RAISED AN ISSUE WHERE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND SOMEONE WHO HAS THOUGHT ABOUT THAT SAME ISSUE OVER TIME AND IS AND IS EITHER DOING SOMETHING NOW THAT THEY FIND TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE OR IS TRYING SOMETHING NOW. SO WE SEE THIS TREMENDOUS WILLINGNESS IT'S JUST VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THOSE PRACTICES OUT OF THE YOU KNOW THE BOUTIQUE BOX RIGHT THAT THE MENDOCINO MIRACLE AND SPREAD THEM AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO THAT SORT OF INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY ANALYSIS OF IS IT ACTUALLY WORKING AND WHY DOES IT WORK. AND TO DO THAT IN A WAY. THAT WITHIN SHAPE THE OTHER COUNTIES BUT WE'RE VERY OPTIMISTIC BECAUSE THERE'S- A RICHNESS OF. LEADERSHIP AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND IN OUR STATE AGENCIES THERE'S A RICHNESS OF RESOURCES AS YOU TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE M. HSA. AND TODAY MORE THAN EVER BEFORE THERE'S A RENEWED COMMITMENT TO TACKLE SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES. IT'S NOT EASY IT'S ACTUALLY VERY VERY DIFFICULT MOSTLY FOR LONGSTANDING CULTURAL ISSUES OF WE DON'T TO DO THIS AND THEN THESE OTHER ISSUES LIKE INADEQUATE WORK FORCE BARRIERS TO ACCESSING DATA. NO DOLLARS FOR TA OR VERY LIMITED TO I SHOULD SAY VERY LIMITED DOLLARS FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT I THINK CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS ALL OF THOSE ISSUES. THANK YOU AND I THINK BEFORE WE SELECTED FOR A MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL WILL TAKE ONE MORE QUESTION FROM MS CREA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER CHAIR FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING. I ALONG SIDE SENATOR BELL ARE ACTUALLY THE LEGISLATIVE. MEMBERS THAT SIT ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION AND I WANT TO THANK MISTER HEALING. FOR ALL THE WORK THAT HE AND HIS TEAM DUE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD IN OUR MENTAL HEALTH. ABILITIES TO SERVICE THE STATE AND FOR YOUR SPONSORSHIP FOR A. B. FORTY SIX WHICH AIMS THAT WHICH WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR JUST RECENTLY IT'S A BILL THAT I AUTHORED. THAT AIMS TO CHANGE THE LANGUAGE THAT WE USE TOWARDS MENTAL HEALTH THAT PUTS THE INDIVIDUAL FIRST VERSES. THE MENTAL ISSUE OR MENTAL DISABILITY THAT THEY MAY BE FACING. I WANT TO SHARE JUST AN EXPERIENCE THAT I'VE HAD AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES FIRE DEPARTMENT CONVENED A SERIES OF OPEN HOUSES IN THE DISTRICT THAT MYSELF AND OUR CHIEF OF STAFF. ATTENDED WE WENT TO SEVERAL FIRE HOUSES AND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FIFTY ONE. AND THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT CAME UP FOR FIRST RESPONDERS WAS THEIR ABILITY TO MANAGE. A CRISIS IN OUR CITY WHEN IT COMES TO HOMELESSNESS WHEN IT COMES TO ISSUES OF MENTAL HEALTH. WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR ABILITY TO. DO THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TRAINED. AND WANT TO DO VERSUS THE WORK OF. MENTAL HEALTH CAPACITY ON THE GROUND AND SO THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT CAME UP IN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT FIRE HOUSES THAT WE VISITED WAS THE LACK OF RESOURCES WE NEED TO THE POINT OF HOW DOES THE COUNTY AND AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS WORK TOGETHER. TO ENSURE THAT THE FOLKS THAT ARE ON THE GROUND THAT ARE THE FIRST ONES TO DO THE ONE ON ONE CONTACT HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB EFFECTIVELY. THAT WAS VERY EYE OPENING FOR ME BECAUSE FIRST RESPONDERS PARAMEDICS FIREFIGHTERS ARE ARE TRAINED TO DO A VERY SPECIFIC JOB. AND WHAT THE PRICES THAT WERE FACING ONTHE GROUND. IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO DO SO. SO WHILE AND I SAY THIS SPECIFICALLY TO THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES SKID ROW IN PARTICULAR WHICH IS JUST ADJACENT TO MY DISTRICT. THE INCREASE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO ARE NON CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE SEEKING SERVICES HERE IN OUR STATE. AND THIS WAS REPEATED TO ME OVER AND OVER. TAKE A BUS OR HAVE A ONE WAY TICKET FROM THE STATE'S AT THEIR FROM. TO COME TO CALIFORNIA OFTENTIMES LANDING IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES. WHERE THE WE HAVE FORTUNATELY IN THE COUNTY A GREAT PROGRAMS TO ASSIST PEOPLE BUT BE INFLOW IN THE AMOUNT OF FOLKS THAT ARE COMING IN. OUT WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO MANAGE THAT AND IT'S CREATED. A CRISIS THAT'S MORE THAN JUST ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND I WOULD EXPECT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE ALSO COMING INTO OUR STATE FOR SERVICES AND SO IT'S A MUCH BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDING IS GOING AND HOW THE COUNTY IS MANAGING IT. HOW THEY'RE WORKING WITH AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS ACROSS DIFFERENT REGIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FOLKS THAT ARE ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK FIRSTHAND HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY AND I PUT THAT. OUT THERE BECAUSE I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERY MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE TO MEET WITH FIRST RESPONDERS TO ME WITH THEIR LOS ANGELES THEIR FIRE DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS THEIR POLICE DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT. THEY'RE HEARING FROM PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY DO THE WORK ON THE GROUND THAT'S BEYOND THE DEPARTMENTS BUT REALLY THE FOLKS THAT ARE TRYING TO MANAGE THIS CRISIS. THANK YOU. IN TOKYO. AND WITH THAT THANK YOU AGAIN TO OUR PANELISTS WILL GO AHEAD IN OUR WORK NOT THE PARTICIPANTS FOR OUR SECOND PANEL. WHICH WILL FOCUS ON. THE STATE AND COUNTY OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY AND FUTURE DIRECTION AS MUCH AS AN HSA FUNDING. VIEWING IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO JOIN US AND THAT WE COULD GO AHEAD AND HAVE OUR OTHER PANELISTS HE'S GOT AN INCREASED INTRODUCE YOURSELVES THANKS. GOOD MORNING JENNIFER CAN DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THE MORNING BRENDA GRAY ALICIA ASSISTANT DEPUTY FOR BEHAVIOR HEALTH BEACH YES GOOD MORNING DOCTOR ANNIKA KELLY BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTOR SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. GOOD MORNING MICHELLE COVERED AT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING THEY WILL GO AHEAD AND KICK OFF WITH DH CS THANKS. SO I THINK I IN RESPONSE TO THE STAFF QUESTIONS AN OVERALL AGENDA WANTED TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL TO WHAT THE LA RD REFERENCED IN TERMS OF THE AUDIT AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE AS A DEPARTMENT TO IMPROVE BOTH THE OVERSIGHT AS WELL AS THE ACCOUNTABILITY. AT THE MHSAA FUNDS. FIRST WANTED TO JUST ALSO STRESS THAT YOU KNOW TO THE- QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL AROUND. YOU KNOW IS AN HSA EITHER WORKING OR IS IT IS IT WORKING WELL I THINK WHAT WE WOULD SAY AND WHAT WE STRONGLY BELIEVE IS THAT IT. UNLIKE OTHER STATES IS ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE. PARTS ABOUT CALIFORNIA FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT WHEN EITHER. HOLES ARE PROBLEMS ARE IDENTIFIED I THINK WE TYPICALLY AS A STATE STEP IN WITH A UNIQUE SET OF SOLUTIONS. I THINK THERE IS NO OTHER STATE THAT HAS SEPARATE AND UNIQUE AND CERTAINLY NOT AS A SUBSTANTIAL A FUNDING SOURCE AS WHAT THEY MAY JUST SAY IS AND SO. YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT IT DID NOT EXIST I THINK WE WOULD BE IN AN EVEN WORSE POSITION AS A STATE IN TERMS OF. THE VITAL SERVICES AN ADDITIONAL REVENUE THAT IT BRINGS TO THE OVERALL SAFETY NET. SO REALLY WANTED TO JUST KIND OF LAY THAT OUT IN TERMS OF HOW WE VIEW THE FUND AND ITS OVERALL CONTRIBUTION TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH. SYSTEM THAT WE SUPPORT AS A DEPARTMENT OVERALL NOT JUST MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BUT ALSO THE OVERALL SAFETY NET THAT IS. COMPRISED IN OF THIS FUNDS. SO WITH THE AUDIT THERE WERE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS THE FIRST ONE WAS THAT WE NEEDED TO DEVELOP A FORMAL AN HSA FISCAL REVERSION PROCESS. WE DEVELOP THIS THROUGH A COUPLE OF INFORMATION NOTICES. AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY HAVE SUBMITTED FISCAL REGULATIONS TO THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. BUT THAT REVERSION PROCESS AS WAS TALKED ABOUT IN THE FIRST PANEL. WE RE OUT REVERTED AND REALLOCATED APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED AND ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE COUNTIES. AS REQUIRED UNDER AB ONE FOURTEEN. THE BIGGEST OF. COMPLIMENTS OF THAT REVERSION REALLOCATION WERE IN THE P. E. I. FUNDS AND THE INNOVATION FUNDS AT SUPPORT AT THE CSS FUND IS THE ONE THAT IS THE BULK OF THE IMAGE IS A FUNDS THAT GO TO THE COUNTY IS. DIRECTLY FOR SERVICES AND THOSE ARE THE FUNDS THAT WE CONSISTENTLY SEE USED SUBSTANTIVELY AND NOT NOT A LOT IS SUBJECT TO REVISION IN THAT AREA AND SO JUST WANTING TO ALSO STRESS. THAT THE FOR THE FUNDS THEMSELVES ARE BEING USED FOR SERVICES WITHIN THE TIME FRAME THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE TO SPEND THOSE FUNDS AND SO WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT AS IT PERTAINS TO BOTH REVERSION AND REALLOCATION. AFTER TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN WE HAVE STARTED REVERTING FUNDS THAT WERE NOT SPENT OR DID NOT HAVE A PLAN BY THE COUNTIES TO SPEND THOSE BY JULY FIRST. DATE THIS HAS TOTALED. EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND REFLECT UNSPENT. IN TWO AND FIVE AND TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SO AGAIN EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OVER MULTIPLE YEARS WITH FUNDS THAT HAVE RANGE YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE TOTAL OVERALL. ALLOCATION OF THE ACT IN THE YOU KNOW IT ANY THINK THE LOWEST IN THE ROAD AND THE RECESSION WAS SOMEWHERE IN THE SEVEN TO EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN NOW YOU AS WE NOTED WERE UP OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUES. WE HAVE ALSO ISSUED REVERSION NOTICES TO THE COUNTIES THAT'S APPROXIMATELY EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR COUNTIES WITH A POPULATION OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE OR MORE THAT HAVEN'T SPENT THE MONEY AND THEY'RE SUBJECT TO REVERSION AND SO. YOU KNOW AGAIN THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT HAS BEEN BOTH REPORTED IN REALLOCATED TO THE COUNTIES IS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION SOME OF THEM HAVE OBVIOUSLY SUBMITTED PLANS TO THE AWAY SEE FOR USING THOSE INNOVATION FUNDS. AND THEN VERY VERY SMALL AMOUNTS BOTH REMITTED AND OR REVERTED BACK TO THE COUNTIES AND THOSE ARE EIGHT MILLION AN EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION SO JUST WANT TO. I WANT TO JUST NOTE THAT IN TERMS OF I THINK THAT'S A FAIRLY GOOD INDICATOR OF HOW THIS HOW THE FUNDS ARE BEING USE. THE AUDIT HAD ALSO ASKED THAT WE CLARIFY THAT THE INTEREST EARNED ON AND SPENT AN HSA FUNDS WAS SUBJECT TO REVERSION AND SO WE DID THAT THROUGH BOTH AN INFORMATION NOTICE AND INCLUDED IT. IN THE FISCAL REGULATIONS PACKAGE SO THAT HAS BEEN DONE. THE THIRD RECOMMENDATION THAT WE NEEDED TO ESTABLISH AND ENFORCE UPROOTED RESERVE LEVEL. AND SO WE HAVE DONE THAT WE INITIALLY SET THAT AS THROUGH AN INFORMATION NOTICING THAT IT WAS SET AT THIRTY THREE PERCENT. OF THE LARGEST DISTRIBUTION TO THE COUNTY FROM THE IMAGE AS A FUND IN THE FISCAL YEAR. AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY YOU THE LEGISLATURE I CHANGE THAT W. NIGHT CODE TO SAY THAT. THE PRUDENT RESERVE COULD NOT EXCEED 33% OF THE AVERAGE CSS REVENUE RECEIVED IN THE PRIOR FIVE YEARS AND SO WE CHANGE THAT THROUGH A SEPARATE SUBSEQUENT INFORMATION NOTICE. AND THEN WE HAVE ALSO ADDRESS THAT AND THE REGULATIONS THAT WERE FILED WITH THE A. L. THE AUDITOR HAD NOTED. A TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR FUND BALANCE AND THE MHSAA FUND AS PART OF THE AUDIT THAT FROM A STATE FISCAL PERSPECTIVE IS ALMOST LIKE SAYING YOU HAVE AN OPEN LINE OF CREDIT BUT WITH NO CREDIT CHARGED TO THE ACCOUNT AND SO WE WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT ACCOUNT WAS A DIDN'T HAVE ANY CASH IN IT AND THEN BE HAS SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN CLOSED AND I THINK THAT WAS ALSO. SOME OF THE- AFTER EFFECTS OF MOVING THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH THE COMMUNITY PORTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. SO THERE WAS PROBABLY SOME HISTORICAL CLEAN UP THAT JUST HADN'T BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR SO WE APPRECIATED THE AUDITOR. BRINGING THAT TO OUR ATTENTION. AS NOTED AS- WE WERE. ASKED TO SUBMIT YOU KNOW FISCAL REGULATIONS AND IMPLEMENT A WITH WHOLE PROCESS FOR COUNTIES THAT WERE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH SUBMITTING REPORTS. SO JUST RECALL COUNTIES HAVE TO SUBMIT ANNUAL REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE REPORTS TO US AND SOME. OF THOSE HAD NOT BEEN DONE EITHER IN QUITE SOME TIME OR WERE QUITE DELAYED. WE IMPLEMENTED A WITH WHOLE PROCESS BACK IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. SO FOR ANY COUNTY THAT DOES NOT SUBMIT THEIR ARI ARE ON TIME WE WITHHOLD TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THEIR MHSAA ALLOCATION UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THOSE ARI OURS ARE SUBMITTED TO US. WE DON'T HAVE A 100% COMPLIANCE BUT WE ARE AND WE HAVE SEEN. EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF RESPONSE FROM THE COUNTIES AND SO THERE ARE VERY FEW COUNTIES THAT ARE STILL ON A WITH HOLD FOR. FAILURE TO SUBMIT ARI OURS AND WE HAVE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH. THE COUNTIES AS WELL AS THE ASSOCIATION TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT THAT COUNTIES ARE COMPLYING WITH THAT AND THEN ONCE THEY DO FILED ARI OURS WE RELEASE THOSE FUNDS AND SO. ONE COUNTY FILED MULTIPLE YEARS AND WE FINALLY REVERTED THOSE FUNDS LAST MONTH. WE WERE ASKED TO ESTABLISH A PROCESS FOR CONDUCTING COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM REVIEWS AND STARTING THOSE REVIEWS ON THIS IS A PLACE AND TIME OF THE AGENDA THAT WE WOULD NOTE THAT WE CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE ASTRA RESOURCES TO DO THAT WORK AND YOU RESPONDED YOU GAVE US THIRTEEN POSITIONS TO DO BOTH FISCAL AND PROGRAMMATIC OVERSIGHT AND SO THOSE PROGRAM REVIEWS HAVE STARTED WE DID THE FIRST ROUND OF THOSE WE DID FOR COUNTIES IN THE SUMMER AND FALL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THEN WE ARE ON TRACK TO DO COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM REVIEWS FOR UP TO TWENTY IN THE FISCAL YEAR. SO BECAUSE THERE'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WERE NOT ABLE TO GET TO THEM EVERY STEP ALL OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME AND SO WE PUT THEM THROUGH A ROTATING BASIS FROM JANUARY OF TWENTY NINETEEN THROUGH JUNE OF THIS THIS JUST TWO MONTHS AGO WE DID COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM REVIEWS FOR NAPA SAN LUIS OBISPO MAYOR OPPOSE A LOS ANGELES IMPERIAL GLENN KERN ALPINE SKIER RIVERSIDE AND SISKIYOU SOME OF THOSE COUNTIES RECEIVED FINDINGS SO WHEN WE DO THESE COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM REVIEWS WERE LOOKING AT A SERIES OF EITHER PROGRAM AREAS ARE POLICY AREAS AND SIMILAR TO HOW WE WOULD DO AN AUDIT AND MEDI CAL WE WILL ISSUE LIKE AN AUDIT FINDING AND SAY THERE'S A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN THAT'S NEEDED AND SO. WE HAVE DONE THAT WITH SOME OF THESE COUNTIES AND SO WE WILL BE POSTING BOTH THE PROGRAM REVIEW AS WELL AS ANY OF ROTH THE RESPONSES FROM THE COUNTIES BUT I THINK OVERALL AND WE HAVE NOT NOTED ANY SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE THE COUNTIES ARE THE THINGS THAT WERE SEEN CONSISTENTLY IN THE PROGRAM VIEWS AND I THINK THIS ALSO HELPS DETERMINE. THE AREAS IN WHICH WE TRY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. SOME OF THE NARRATIVE AROUND WHAT THE COUNTIES ARE DOING IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW I WOULD AND I SHOULD STEP BACK AND JUST REMIND. THE COMMITTEE THE COUNTIES THEMSELVES WHEN THEY SET OUT EITHER PROGRAMS OR INITIATIVES THAT THEY WANT TO FUND WITH THEIR IMAGES TO SEE AN HSA FUNDS. THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS AND OBVIOUSLY GOING THROUGH LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS IF SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN EITHER BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS OR CITY COUNCIL YOU CAN APPRECIATE THAT SOMETIMES THAT IS A LITTLE BIT LONGER. AND SO THE LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS I THINK IT HAS DEFINITELY BEEN NOTED AS SOMETHING THAT IS SUCCESSFUL THE BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS ALL COMPLY WITH THE WAY IN WHICH THOSE FUNDS ARE. EITHER DEVELOPS DETERMINED OR PROGRAMS AT A LOCAL LEVEL BUT WHAT WE HAVE NOTED ISSOMETIMES THE NARRATIVE AROUND WHAT IS REPORTED TO US IS NOT ALWAYS AS FULLY. ENCOMPASSING AS WE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE JUST BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO SEE WHAT HAS BEEN EITHER APPROVED OR INCLUDED IN IN THE LOCAL PLAN AND SO SOME OF THOSE HAVE COME UP IN IN THE COUNTRY. COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM REVIEWS. I WOULD SAY ALSO THAT. THERE HAVE BEEN AS LACK OF CONSISTENCY AND HOW THEY BOTH A DOCUMENT THEIR PROGRAMS AND WHAT THEY NAMED THEM SO WHEN YOU TRY TO MATCH UP A LOCALLY APPROVED PLAN AND THEN YOU TRY TO MATCH IT UP TO ITS ANNUAL EXPENDITURE REPORT SOMETIMES THEY DON'T MATCH AND SO WE'VE HAD TO GO BACK AND WORK WITH THE COUNTY IS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THEY ARE DOING THOSE TWO DOCUMENTS THAT WE CAN LINK THEM UP AND  THINK THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY. A BIG THING IT'S JUST YOU KNOW THEIR THREE YEAR PLANS AND SO IF STAFF CHANGES OR SOMETHING HAPPENS THOSE TEND TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO TRACK AND THEN LASTLY SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE NOTED IN SMALLER COUNTIES IS THAT YOU HAVE TO EXPAND 51% MORE THAN 51% OF YOUR P. I. FUNDS TO INDIVIDUALS TWENTY FIVE OR YEARS OR YOUNGER. IN SOME COUNTIES NOT LOS ANGELES BUT PERHAPS IN SOME OF A DOCTOR WOODS COUNTIES THERE'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT BIG OF A POPULATION UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE IN ORDER FOR YOU TO DO SOMETHING THAT AREA AND SO THAT'S BEEN SOME OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE RURAL COUNTIES. THE SUCCESS AS I NOTED IN THE PROGRAM REVIEWS IS THAT COUNTIES HAVE BEEN CIRCULATING THEIR THREE YEAR PLAN AN ANNUAL UPDATE FOR PUBLIC REVIEW AND COMMENT. ON THE BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN APPROVING THOSE PLANS. IN FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS COUNTIES HAVE BEEN DESIGNATING A PERSONAL SERVICE COORDINATOR CASE MANAGER FOR EVERY SINGLE CLIENT AS REQUIRED. SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS OBVIOUSLY BOTH IMPORTANT CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THAT. MOST COUNTIES ARE PROVIDING FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP SERVICES TO ALL AGE GROUPS. AND WHAT WE ARE NOTING IS THAT THEY'VE BEEN VERY FEW TREATMENT PLAN ISSUES IDENTIFIED WHEN WE GO IN AND LOOK AT THE TREATMENT PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED. IN MEANING THAT THE CLIENT IS PARTICIPATING IN THE OVERALL DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR- PLAN AS WELL AS ARTICULATING GOALS AND THEIR DOCUMENTING. HOW THE CLAIM IS PROGRESSING IN THOSE GOALS AND THE RESILIENCY IN PERSONAL SERVICE COORDINATOR IS OBVIOUSLY SHOWN TO BE WORKING WITH THAT CLIENT. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE OTHER SUCCESSES THAT WE ARE HEARTENED BY IS THAT SOME. NOT NOT ALL BUT SOME COUNTIES ARE OFFERING HOUSING SUPPORT IN SOME FORM. YOU KNOW OUTSIDE OF AN HSA. WE AT THE- STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM THROUGH A WHOLE PERSON CARE. HAVE BEEN PROVIDING HOUSING SUPPORT. TO MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES I THINK THAT IS HELP TO AUGMENT SOME OF THE WORK AND THE FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN. DONE AND PERFORM THROUGH EMIT AN HSA AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW WHEN YOU STEP BACK AND LOOK AT ALL THE DIFFERENT FUND SOURCES. AND WHAT IS BEEN DRIVEN DOWN AT THE COUNTY LEVEL IN TERMS OF RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. YOU KNOW TO A DOCTOR WOODS EARLIER COMMENT AROUND IT'S BEEN A LOT AND THE RESPONSIBILITY IS SIGNIFICANT. I THINK WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTIES AND HOW THEY ACHIEVE. ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT BOTH COMPLIANCE ISSUES AS WELL AS- OVERALL GOALS TOWARDS CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WITH BOTH. MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SO. I'M HAPPY TO. STOP THERE AND TAKE QUESTIONS BUT CERTAINLY WANTED TO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME AND TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT WE'VE DONE IT WHAT WE FEEL IS BEEN. YOU KNOW A PRETTY GOOD RESPONSE TO THE AUDITOR'S REPORT WE CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPORTANT WORK OF THE AUDITOR TO. CALL THOSE ISSUES OUT FOR US TO. THE THANK YOU AND AS YOU SAID AS THE LA HAD HAD NEEDED AS WELL SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE MADE YOUR- HUGE STRIDES IN TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING THE- LARGELY KIND OF ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES AS IDENTIFIED BY THE AUDIT. THAT DOESN'T IN THAT IS A REALLY GOOD AT THE HEART AS- IS THIS STUFF WORKING. IS THE MONEY HAVING IMPACTED WANTED TO HAVE AND I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHO EITHER ON YOUR TEAM ELSEWHERE. WAKES UP EVERY MORNING AND GO TO BED BED EVERY NIGHT THINKING ABOUT THAT. WELL I WOULD SAY THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE DEPARTMENT THAT PROBABLY GO TO SLEEP THINKING ABOUT IT AND PROBABLY WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT I'M LOOKING AT. A LOT SHE SENDS ME EMAILS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. I THINK THAT. IT HAS BEEN A REALLY LONG ROAD FROM. I CAN RECALL. YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE DONE HEALTH CARE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THE TIMES IN WHICH MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WAS BROUGHT UP. WHEN I FIRST STARTED WORKING IN THIS AREA WAS HARDLY EVER AND EVEN WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IT WAS KIND OF NOTED AS THERE'S THIS. THERE'S THIS ITEM ON THE TENNIS INTO HEALTH BENEFITS THAT SOMEHOW INDICATES THAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THIS BUT- REALLY THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO REDESIGN. OUR SYSTEM AND WE THINK AND SYSTEMS RIGHT. MOST IMPORTANTLY IS HOW DO WE SUPPORT. COUNTIES BROADLY RATE WITH FINANCING DIRECTION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT UNDERLYING ALL OF THOSE BIG SYSTEM THOUGHTS ARE A DEEP ABIDING PASSION FOR THE INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE THAT ARE STRUGGLING IN THOSE COUNTIES AND COMMUNITIES AND I KNOW SO AS DR. MISS QUIRK SILVA INDICATED ALL OF US HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT HAVE OF FAMILY FRIENDS OURSELVES HAVE ISSUES WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT DRIVES A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR DEPARTMENT. I'M NOT JUST IN THE DIVISIONS THAT ARE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR MENTAL HEALTH BUT ACROSS THE- THE DIFFERENT AREAS. WE HAVE A NEW DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THAT I STARTED AS I THINK WE'RE ON WEEK THREE SHE'S ACTUALLY DONE THAT OUR STD CONFERENCE. RIGHT NOW AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO INTRODUCING YOU TO DR KELLY PFEIFFER AND SHE'LL BE WORKING WITH BRENDA MOST DIRECTLY ON A LOT OF THE ISSUES AROUND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. PROBABLY READ IT WE HAVE. WE HAVE REORGANIZED OUR DEPARTMENT AND TAKEN AWAY ANY KIND OF MENTAL HEALTH VERSUS SUBSTANCE USE DIVISION REFERENCE AND WE HAVE COMBINED THEM INTO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. DIVISION BUT I THINK THAT IS ALSO. WE SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANT FOR US AS A DEPARTMENTS TO INDICATE THAT A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE HAVING A SUBSTANCE USE. DISORDER PROBLEM ALSO HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM OR FOR SO AND THE IMPORTANCE IN THE LAW WHICH OF THE TWO. SPECIAL LOOK AT LARGER SOCIETAL ISSUES SUCH AS LISTENERS. SO. IT'S ONE THING TO SAY WORKING AS A TO SAY IT GETTING BETTER AND I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S BOTH. IT IS WORKING FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT WE KNOW THAT THE FUNDING IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO WHAT THE COUNTIES ARE DOING. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BOTH CREATING THE SYSTEMS THAT ACCOUNT FOR THOSE OUTCOMES THERE HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY BEEN A LOT OF MEASUREMENT. PIECES THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY SAVE IS SOMEONE BETTER OFF TODAY THAN THEY WERE TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO AND IF YOU'RE USING JUST VERY. BASIC DATA IT MAY NOT TELL YOU THE FULL ACCOUNTING OF IT AND YOU KNOW A CLASSIC EXAMPLE WHEN I FIRST STARTED THE DEPARTMENT THERE IS A LOT OF ATTENTION AROUND. CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE THAT WERE RECEIVING PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT WERE RECEIVING ONE OR MORE ANTI PSYCHOTICS. AND THE LARGE QUESTION FOR US IS THE DEPARTMENT ALONG WITH SOCIAL SERVICES AND THE COURTS. AND THE COUNTY CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES WAS. ARE THESE CHILDREN BEING MEDICATED APPROPRIATELY AND ALL OF US HAD TO LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND SAY WELL WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE. AND THERE WAS A REALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFORT AROUND DATA MATCHING AND SHARING OF INFORMATION. AND WHEN WE WERE ABLE TO PUT THOSE PIECES TOGETHER AND THEN LOOK AT MEASURES AROUND THE APPROPRIATE USE OF AND MANAGEMENT OF THOSE MEDICATIONS. WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO SEE FROM THE DATA IS THAT CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE ACTUALLY WERE HAVING BOTH BETTER OUTCOMES. AND HAVING BETTER MANAGEMENT OF THOSE DRUGS THAN CHILDREN LARGER MORE LARGELY TREATED IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. SO IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S BOTH AN INTERESTING DATA EXERCISE BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TOOLS FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED IN OUR LARGER PROGRAM. SO TO YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION SAYING DOES THIS WORK IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE IT'S LIKE WILL. WE HAVE TO KIND OF DECIDE YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT THAT WE WANT TO MEASURE WHAT DO WE CONSIDER TO BE SUCCESS AND ARE WE ON A PATH TO GET IN THERE AND I THINK THE ANSWER IS STILL YET TO BE FULLY. BOTH DETERMINED ANSWERED. SO WE ARE IN THE PROCESS AS. I IS BUILDING A FRAMEWORK TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF OUR INVESTMENTS IS THAT I WOULD SAY THE SOPHISTICATION AROUND THE DATA THE SOPHISTICATION AROUND THE USE OF. EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO WORK ALL OF THAT IS EVOLVING THE FIELD ITSELF I THINK IS ALSO EVOLVING THERE'S INCREASING SOPHISTICATION AROUND. THE USE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROFESSIONALS TO HELP MANAGE POPULATIONS I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION IN THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR ROUND PEER COUNSELORS SO SIMILAR TO PROMOTE TORTOISE AND THE MANAGED THE MET AT MEDICAL SIDE OF HELPING YOU KNOW SPECIFIC POPULATIONS I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO DO A LOT OF REALLY GOOD WORK AND THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OF SPACE. AND WE ARE BOTH ENGAGED IN THAT WORK BUT ALSO UNDERSTANDING THAT'S A LONG IT'S A LONG AND EVOLUTION AND IT TAKES A NUMBER OF CONSISTENT YEARS OF BOTH FUNDING AN EFFORT TO GET TO GET FURTHER DOWN THE LINE. THANK YOU I'M THE MAN IN THE INTEREST OF TIME WILL LOOK AT IT AND UPDATING FROM OUR COUNTY FOLKS AND THEN COME BACK TO A- DH CS. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD MORNING CHAIRS AND MEMBERS MICHELLE CABINET WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. I JUST WANT TO START OFF BY THINKING BOTH THE LEGISLATURE'S WELL AS DH CS AND THE OAC FOR ALL OF THE PROGRESS THAT WE BELIEVE WE'VE MADE A SINCE THE AUDIT IN HELPING TO REMEDY. BUT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE FLAGGED BY THAT THE AUDIT I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF OUR FIGHT FIFTY NINE COUNTY AND LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOCAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING AND I'M JOINED. ON TODAY'S PANEL BY DR VERONICA KELLY ARE SAMBAR NAY DINO OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR WHO WILL SPEAK MUCH MUCH MORE. ELOQUENTLY AND FROM THE GROUND ON HOW HOW THE EXPERIENCES OF MANAGING AN HSA FUNDS MY COMMENTS TODAY ARE CENTERED AROUND THE VOLATILITY OF THE IMAGES SAY AS A REVENUE SOURCE FOR LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. AND HOW THIS IMPACTS OUR LEVELS OF UNSPENT FUNDS IMPROVEMENTS AS WELL AS ON GOING CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INNOVATION FUND EXPENDITURES. AND THEN THE OVERSIGHT OF THE IMAGE TO SAY FROM THE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE SINCE LAST YEAR'S AUDIT. AND I WILL HAVE A FEW SUGGESTIONS ON HOW WE CAN STRENGTHEN BOTH A RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR TO REGULATORS AS WELL AS- PROGRAM OVERSIGHT. SO ON THAT THEY HISTORY IN THE VOLATILITY I THINK IT'S HELPFUL FOR US TO LOOK BACK A BIT AND RECALL THAT. THE VOTER APPROVED MILLIONAIRES TAX TO FUND BEHAVIOR OF PROGRAMS OR MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS CAME JUST AT THE RIGHT TIME. WE GOT OUR FIRST DISBURSEMENTS IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE SIX WHICH WAS. JUST OVER A YEAR YEAR AND A HALF BEFORE THE GREAT RECESSION HIT CALIFORNIA AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. AND THAT POINT MHSAA RESERVE REVENUES ARE MUCH LOWER THAN THEY ARE TODAY. I THINK WE WERE STARTED OUT OR TWO AND- THEN AND THEY WERE ALSO THE FIRST FIVE YEARS. OF ANY SIGNIFICANT ME. WHICH IN THOSE YEARS TO USE THE M. HSA TO HELP US ABSORB THE IMPACTS OF THE BUDGET RECESSION. AND IN ADDITION IT SWEPT UP CLOSE TO A BILLION DOLLARS AN HSA REVENUES INTO THE GENERAL FUND TO HELP WITH OVERALL BUDGET STABILITY. THESE ARE SORT OF HISTORIC ACTIONS BUT I THINK THEY ALSO SPEAK TO KIND OF WHAT WE WERE EXPERIENCING. IN THOSE EARLY YEARS OF LIFTING UP THE MHSAA AND WHY IT IS THAT THE IMAGES SAY LOOKS THE WAY IT DOES TODAY. IN THE ROLE THAT IT PLAYS IN OUR OVERALL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SAFETY NET AND DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR US OVERALL IT. YOU KNOW THE IMAGES SAYS ABOUT 20% OF THE OF THE STATE'S INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR COUNTIES IT'S ABOUT A QUARTER. A TWO DAY OF WHAT WE SPEND AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE TO THAT. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I THINK FOLKS CONSIDER COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONFUSING OR COMPLICATED. IS BECAUSE WE ARE NOT. JUST SERVING ONE POPULATION SO YOU KNOW UNLIKE MEDI CAL WORDS THAT YOU KNOW MEDI CAL THE BENEFICIARIES UNDER CERTAIN YOU KNOW. INCOME THRESHOLD COUNTIES RECEIVE REALIGNMENT DOLLARS AS WELL AS GRANTS AND ME TO SAY FUNDS TO SERVE A VARIETY OF POP POPULATIONS DEPENDING ON THE FUNDING STREAM SO WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY YES FOR THE MEDIC HOW POPPY. XIN THAT HAS A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. BUT WE ALSO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN CRISS REGARDLESS OF THEIR PAY YOUR SOURCE RIGHT SO YOU COULD HAVE BE A PRIVATELY INSURED INDIVIDUAL. WHO GETS ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLDER NEEDS CONSERVATORSHIP AND WE ARE SUPPORT SERVICES. IF YOU'RE IN SALES WE ARE SUPPORTING THIS SERVICES AND. SO IT'S EIGHT IT GETS A LITTLE CONFUSED. SO IT'S IT IT'S COMPLICATED IN THAT WAY I THINK OTHERWISE YOU KNOW OF THE QUARTER THE BULK OF OUR FUNDING OBVIOUSLY COMES THROUGH MEDI CAL AND THAT IS OUR CORE POPULATION. NEAR ME TO SAY IS CRITICAL BOTH TO OUR MEDIC HEALTH SERVICES IT BRINGS IN CLOSE TO. A BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION IT'S ALSO CRITICAL TO BE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ARE CRISIS CONTINUE HIMSELF IT'S REALLY AT AND DR KELLY WILL SPEAK MORE TO THAT. SO AS WE TURN THE CORNER AND START TO COME OUT OF THE GREAT RECESSION IN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES EXPERIENCED OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT AND IMPACT THE MHSAA EVOLUTION THE FIRST ONE IS TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT WHERE WE BRING WITH IT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL CHILDREN AND PUTTING UP THE OF NON FEDERAL SHARE FOR OUR CHILDREN IN MEDI CAL THROUGH EPS D. T. THE NEXT ONE IS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH OTHERS HAVE NOTED TODAY. THIS BOTH INCREASES THE NUMBER OF MEDI CAL ELIGIBLES IN OUR SYSTEM AND ALSO THE NON FEDERAL SHARE AND YOU'LL SEE FROM THE LA OWES GRAPH THAT THE NOT THE FEDERAL. PORTION OF FUNDING THAT COMES INTO OUR SYSTEM HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AND WE WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S A GOOD THING WE ALSO EXPERIENCED TO THE CONSOLIDATION A MENTAL HEALTH UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THE ELIMINATION OF WHAT USED TO BE THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH. ON TOP WITH THESE CHANGES SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION IN CALIFORNIA ARE AN HSA REVENUES ALONE HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED SO. DH CS HAS AND ALONG WITH THE LEGISLATURE IMPLEMENTED IN IN THIS PAST YEAR A 33% CAP ON OUR PRUDENT RESERVES IN TERMS OF ALL THAT THE NEW MONEY THAT WE'RE GETTING IN. AND YOU KNOW WE WANT TO NOTE THAT IN ADDITION TO THAT 33% TOP THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALSO PROPOSED THROUGH THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE IN PROCESS RIGHT NOW A MINIMUM RESERVE LEVEL OF TWENTY THREE PERCENT. THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION ACTUALLY COMMENTED TO THE DEPARTMENT THAT WE DO NOT THINK THAT HAVING THE MINIMUMS 23% IS A GOOD IDEA ALONG WITH THE MAXIMUM 33% AND THE REASON IS WITH THE VOLATILITY OF THIS REVENUE SOURCE THE UPS AND THE DOWNS. IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY HARD. THE FISCAL MANAGEMENT STANDPOINT TO FIGURE OUT THAT HERE AND SORT OF MAINTAIN WITHIN THAT AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT WHEN WE DO HIT THE NEXT RECESSION WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT OUR ABILITY. TO REACH INTO THOSE RESERVES TO SUSTAIN PROGRAMS ON AN ONGOING BASIS IF WE'RE REQUIRED AT THAT POINT TO MAINTAIN THAT 23% LOWER AMOUNT AS WELL. SO THAT'S ONE THING I WANTED TO KNOW IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE NEW WAYS THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN TRYING TO ADDRESS THE AUDIT FINDINGS. WE HAVE NOT YET TESTED THE THIRTY 3% MAXIMUM RESERVE LEVEL AND WE WILL FIND OUT IN OUR NEXT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN HOW THAT WORKS FOR US BUT I CAN SAY THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO AGAIN. MAINTAIN CORE PROGRAMS WHEN WE WHEN WE GET INTO A RECESSION AND YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGE FOR US AS OTHERS HAVE NOTED IS WE MUST ENGAGE OUR LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS WE THINK THAT THAT'S A REALLY VALUABLE AND IMPORTANT PART OF THE WAY THAT WE RUN OUR PROGRAMS. AND SO YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY'S ON BOARD WITH WITH HOW WE'RE GOING TO SEE IF SEE THROUGHT OUT MORE CHALLENGING TIMES AND TODAY. IN ADDITION TO THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS FROM THE STATE THIS YEAR COUNTIES AS DCS NOTED HAVE BEEN RECEIVING ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONAL NOTICES TO PROVIDE CLARIFICATION AND GUIDANCE. OUR MEMBERS HAVE ALSO REPORTED TO US ABOUT THE AUDITS THAT ARE BEING DONE IN SEVERAL COUNTIES STARTING AT THE END OF LAST YEAR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD KNOWN IS THAT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THESE AUDITS ARE ABOUT COMPLIANCE WITH OUR SPENDING RULES AND THAT. YOU KNOW. WE HAVE THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT WHEN THEY LOOKED AT THE THREE COUNTIES IN THE AUDIT COUNTIES WERE GENERALLY DOING A GOOD JOB OF MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT OF THEIR EXPENDITURES. ARE MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE TWO REGULATORS AS WELL AS COUNTIES TO HELP US FIGURE OUT WHICH PROGRAMS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE AND THAT REALLY GETS TO A LOT OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY BOTH FROM DH CS AS WELL AS THE AC. I THINK IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT WANTING TO SEE MORE OF THAT ANALYSIS ON WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT AND WHAT WHAT COULD WE CONSIDER COUNTY COUNTY TO COUNTY TO SCALE UP. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT AND NOTICE AND SORT OF RECOGNIZE THE OAC FOR IS THEIR NEW WORK ON SOME OF THIS THESE DATA. MASH UPS THAT TOBY WAS DESCRIBING IN PARTICULAR WE REALLY LOVE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP DATA ANALYSIS IT WAS ASTONISHING FOR US TO SEE THAT FOR PEOPLE WITH HIGH NUMBERS OF ARRESTS GOING THROUGH FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS WHILE THEY WERE IN THE FS P. THEIR ARREST RATE WENT DOWN BY 69% AND FOLLOWING EXIT. EXITING THE OFFICE P. EITHER RACE PRESS RATES WENT DOWN BY 64% I MEAN THAT IS IT A TREMENDOUS RETURN ON IT YES MEN AND I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS WRIT LARGE YOU KNOW OUR COLLABORATIONS OUR PARTNERS AND OUR INTEGRATION REALLY IS ACROSS SO MANY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. OTHERS NOTED AGAIN KELLY WILL SPEAK TO THAT. WITH A LOT MORE GRANULAR PRETTY WELL. THE STATE'S GUIDANCE ON PRUDENT RESERVES HAS BEEN VIEWED AS VERY HELPFUL TO WORK COUNTIES THEY ALSO FELT THAT THEY WOULD BENEFIT FROM CHITONS ON OPERATIONAL RESERVES SO THIS IS AN AREA. NOT RAISED BY THE AUDITOR OR OR BY OTHERS TODAY BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE COUNTY IS BROUGHT TO US THAT THEY THOUGHT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL FOR US. THEY ALSO WOULD LIKE TO ASK THAT OUR REGULATORS CONSULT WITH US MORE IN PROVIDING SOME OF THIS GUIDANCE. AGAIN RIGHT NOW OUR PRUDENT RESERVES CAN ONLY BE USED IN A MAJOR STATEWIDE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND SOME OF OUR COUNTIES NOTED THAT WHEN WE HAVE LOCAL EMERGENCIES OR DISASTERS OR EVEN A LOCAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT ISN'T FELT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THAT THOSE ARE INSTANCES WHERE WE SHOULD WE THINK BE ABLE TO REACH AND TREVOR SERVICE AND USE THOSE. ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE SPENDING HAS BEEN MOST DIFFICULT FOR US AS HAS BEEN NOTED IS IN OUR INNOVATIONS PROGRAMS. AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW THE REASONS FOR THIS ARE MULTI FOLD FIRST IT IT'S OBVIOUSLY MORE CHALLENGING OVER TIME TO COME UP WITH THE NEXT NEW INNOVATIVE THING. YOU KNOW WITH THE AT THE FURTHER WE GET ALONG AN MA TO SAY THE MORE WE CAN LOOK BACK AND SAY WELL SOMEBODY ALREADY DID THAT OR THEY DID IT IN THIS WAY OR THAT. SO THAT'S ONE CHALLENGE AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED SMALLER COUNTIES HAVE LACKEY ADMINISTRATIVE OR STAFF RESOURCES TO COME UP WITH SOME OF THESE INNOVATION PROJECTS. AND THEN TYPICALLY OVER THE OVER THE PAST WE'D HAVE HAD FIVE THREE TO FIVE YEAR PLANNING CYCLES PLANNING THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION CYCLES AND IT YOU KNOW FOR ANYONE WHO'S WORKED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR DONE RESEARCH AND- AND DEVELOPMENT OR START UPS YOU COULD UNDERSTAND THAT THREE TO FIVE YEAR WINDOW TO GO FROM. YOU KNOW START TO END IS REALLY AGGRESSIVE AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT IT'S REALLY NOT IN LA ME WITH WHAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR WOULD DO SO WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE TO OUR TO THE LEGISLATURE TO THE AC AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WHO WORKED WITH US TO. WITHIN THE INNOVATIONS PROJECTS ALLOW US TO A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY ON TIMELINE WE THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO DO A LOT TO HELP US SEE THROUGH EVEN MORE AMBITIOUS INNOVATION PROJECTS WHICH- WHICH IS REALLY THE POINT THERE. WE HAVE TRADITIONALLY ALSO STRUGGLED WITH REALLY SIMPLE. THINGS LIKE GETTING ON THE CALENDAR IT THE OAC. SO YOU KNOW IF ACCOUNTING SORT OF LEE IN IN GIVING THE AC THE HEADS UP THAT THEY WANT TO APPLY FOR AN INNOVATION GRANT OR IF THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN ON THE CALENDAR THEY COULD BE WAITING IN THE QUEUE AND MISS THEIR OPPORTUNITY AND THEY NEED TO KIND OF GO RIGHT BACK TO THE BEGINNING. WE WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE OAC HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS IN TRYING TO CORRECT FOR SOME OF THOSE SIMPLE ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES. AND SO YOU KNOW AS WE STREAMLINED THIS WE HOPE TO SEE THOSE INNOVATION FUNDS MOVING OUT OF THE DOOR AND DOING SO IN A WAY THAT WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO SEE. OUR MEDIC HEALTH. YOU KNOW LEVERAGING THROUGH THE AN HSA IS INCREDIBLE YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT IT'S COR TO ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS AND YOU KNOW I'LL JUST SORT OF JUMP PAST ALL THE THINGS I WAS GOING TO SAY ABOUT WHAT THE IMMEDIACY DOES TODAY BECAUSE I THINK DR KELLY WILL SPEAK TO THAT BETTER BUT YOU KNOW WE DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO BALANCE WHAT WE DO MOVING FORWARD IN TERMS OF OUR COMMUNITY VOICES THAT'S REALLY THE CORE OF THE AN HSA IS SORT OF BEING LOCALLY DRIVEN AND COMMUNITY DRIVEN. WITH OUR OUR FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR PUBLIC DOLLARS AND A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT WE WILL SPEND TO THESE FUNDS TIMELY AND IN A WAY THAT REALLY HAS AN IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITIES AT THE SAME TIME WE DO NEED TO RECOGNIZE A THINK AS A BODY THAT THERE'S A TON OF VOLATILITY IN THESE REVENUE STREAMS THE UPS AND DOWNS ARE REALLY HARD TO MANAGE AROUND AND PREDICT AND SO WHEN YOU START ONE THREE YEAR PLANNING CYCLE YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY END UP GETTING A LOT MORE OR A LOT LESS THAN YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO AS YOU GO THROUGH THAT PERIOD. AND THAT'S MADE PLANNING AROUND SOME OF THESE THINGS FOR GOLD FOR SOME OF OUR LARGER COUNTIES ARE SMALLER COUNTIES DON'T SEEM TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SPENDING DOWN THERE HAVE YOU TO SAY DOLLARS IT BY AND LARGE THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE SPENT BUT FOR SOME OF OUR LARGER COUNTIES THING AT MY CHURCH TO RECEIVE AN HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT SPENT FUNDS ONE OF THE STRATEGY THAT'S BEING LLOYD I THINK. MAYBE MUCH TO THE CHAGRIN OF COUNTY BOARDS SUPERVISING. THEY ARE OVER SPENT RIGHT NOW. THERE PROJECTS AND THEIR PLANS ARE OVER WHAT THEY BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING TO GET IN JUST SO THAT THEY CAN TRY TO LEVEL OUT SOME OF THOSE DIFFERENCES AND SO THAT SPEAKS TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS EARLIER ABOUT HOW WE'RE MANAGING WITH THE UNSPENT FUNDS GREAT THANKYOU AND I WAS ABLE TO SAY WE ARE AT NOON WHICH IS AT THE OFFICIAL AND FOR HEARING SO IF IT'S NUMBERS TO NEED TO STEP OUT. COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND BUT I WOULD LOVE TO STAY AND LISTEN TO ADD DR KELLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS PETRIE-NORRIS AND WOOD AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M BONTA KELLY AND THEY HAVE A HEALTH DIRECTOR FOR SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY AND I REALLY AM HERE TO BE THE LOCAL COUNTY VOICE AS- SOMEONE WHO'S ACTUALLY BEEN ON THE GROUND PROVIDING THE SERVICES AND THEN CONTINUES TO MONITOR THEM. I ALSO WANT TO SPEAK TO OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. AS WELL AS THE CHANGES THAT WE MAKE. ON A DAILY BASIS THE LIVES OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE. SO FIRST RD MOUNT OUR PARTNERSHIP COUNTIES CONSIDER OURSELVES TO BE ACTIVE INVESTED PARTNERS WITH DH CS AND THE AC. WE LOOK FORWARD TO MORE PRODUCTIVE COLLABORATIONS NOTICED NOTING OF CHALLENGES EXT EXPERIENCE BY OUR PARTNERS. AND THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE ANNUAL REVENUE EXPENDITURE REPORT THE ARE ARE. AND PART OF THAT WE'VE WORKED VERY HARD WITH OUR PARTNERS AT DH CS. BECAUSE IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THAT FORM YOU HAVE TO COMPLETE YOUR COST REPORT FORM THEY'RE BOTH DO THE SAME DATE. SO YOU NEED TO HAVE COMPLETED ONE FOLLOWING FISCAL YEAR TO COMPLETE THE OTHER. AND IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THERE HAS BEEN SOME DIFFICULTY WITH THE TEMPLATE ITSELF WHICH IS JUST A VERY LOGISTICAL ISSUE BUT IMPACTS EVERYBODY. AND SO WRONG FORMULAS ON ON BOTH OF THOSE FORMS BANK CONTRIBUTED TO US NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET THE DATE REQUIREMENTS. BUT WE WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH DH CS. SO THAT WE COULD COME A COMPLETE ADJUSTMENTS IF WE NEED TO DO THAT. THE DIFFICULTY IN THAT IS THAT THEY ARE OUR DATA IS PULLED FROM THE OAC PUT ON THEIR DASHBOARD AND THOSE THAT INFORMATION MIGHT NOT BE. INCLUSIVE OF THE ADJUSTMENTS BEING MADE AFTER THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT COST REPORT. BUT WE DO APPRECIATE THE RECENTLY ISSUED GUIDANCE AND PROGRAMMING AND THE RESPONSIVENESS I AM THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BY THE DEPARTMENT TO COUNTIES. ARE COUNTY SAN BERNADINO JUST WENT THROUGH OUR IMAGE AS A REVIEW WE FOUND THE OUGHT THE REVIEWERS TO BE VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE AND VERY OPEN WE JUST COMPLETED THAT'LL LAST MONTH. WE ALSO IS COUNTIES APPRECIATE OUR COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION THEY HAVE BEEN VERY OPEN AND RECEIVING FEEDBACK REGARDING THE INNOVATIONS PROCESS WE APPRECIATE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE CONSENT CALENDAR AS WELL AS STAFF APPROVAL FOR FUNDS. PROJECTS THAT ARE UNDER THE ONE MILLION DOLLAR AMOUNT. FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE I WAS CHARGED WITH THE COMMUNITY PLANNING PROCESS AN ORANGE COUNTY. AND I AT THAT POINT WE REALLY NOTICE THAT THIS WAS A BRILLIANT PART OF THE LEGISLATION. TO BEGIN TO ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS IN A PROCESS WHERE WE ACTUALLY TALKED OUT LOUD ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESS REALLY HELPED INCLUDE INCREASE OUR EDUCATION. OF OUR COMMUNITIES OURSELVES AND ALSO. HELPED A DIS DECREASE STIGMA. WE'VE BEEN DOING STAKEHOLDER PROCESS SEES EVERY YEAR SOME OF OUR COUNTIES TO IT MORE OFTEN WE DO IT EVERY MONTH. FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AND SO WHAT THAT HAS AFFORDED US IS THE ABILITY TO CREATE LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS THAT ALLOWS US TO LEVERAGE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND AS AS AS IMPORTANT FUNDING FROM OUR PARTNERS AND COMMUNITY. THAT INCLUDES OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT INCLUDES OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS BOTH SHERIFF AND LOCAL. OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEM OF CARE OUR FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. COUNTIES WE REALLY DO SEE AN HSA LIKE THE REBAR. THAT IS BENEATH THE BRICKS WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING A STRUCTURE IT HAS NOW BECOME THE ACTUAL STRUCTURE ITSELF THAT REALLY ONLY STRENGTHENS THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WE CAN PROVIDE. AND SO JUST TO MOVE ON TO HOW AN HSA IS WORKING. LET ME JUST ALSO SAY THAT PRIOR TO IN TWO THOUSAND NINE WE GO BACK TEN YEARS IN MY COUNTY WE SERVED THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND ON DUPLICATED CLIENTS A YEAR TODAY WE SERVE OVER SIXTY THOUSAND ON DUPLICATED CLIENTS A YEAR. CERTAINLY THAT WAS WITH THE ADVENT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BUT ALSO AN HSA AND ALSO OUR CHANGING WORLD. AM I JUST A HAS ALLOWED US TO EXPAND OUR PUBLIC SERVICES HAVE TO RESPOND TO VERY COMPLEX NEEDS. OF A VERY DIVERSE POPULATION AND I'M NOT JUST SPEAKING TO ETHNICITY OR LANGUAGE ABOUT DIVERSITY I MEAN. COUNTIES WHERE WE HAVE RURAL URBAN AND FRONTIER AREAS FROM THE LARGEST COUNTY IN THE CONTIGUOUS UNITED STATES WITH OVER TWENTY ONE THOUSAND SQUARE MILES. I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR FRONTIER AREAS. AS WELL AS VERY POPULATED URBAN AREAS. I MIGHT JUST SAY ALLOWS US TO GO BEYOND OUR CURRENT BENEFIT STRUCTURE ON BOTH THE PRIVATE AND THE PUBLIC SIDE WHICH IS AN AMAZING THING IT ADDS FLEXIBILITY FOR SERVICE DELIVERY. IT ALLOWS CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION THAT ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE SERVICES THAT RESEARCH TELLS US ARE ESSENTIAL TO CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS. BUT. SIMPLY ONE INDIVIDUAL SESSION OR BY A PRESCRIPTION PAD. THAT EXTRA THE IMAGE AS A BRINGS ALLOWS US TO ATTEND TO THE WHOLE PERSON AND NOT JUST ONE PSYCHIATRIC EPISODE. FOR EXAMPLE. YOLO COUNTY MATCHES THEIR FIRST FIVE DOLLARS WITH MHSAA AS NEEDED TO PROVIDE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENS TO CHILDREN ZERO TO FIVE AND THE FOLLOW UP SERVICES AS NEEDED IF THE CHILDREN DON'T HAVE INSURANCE OR IT'S NOT CONSIDERED MEDICALLY NECESSARY. IN NEVADA COUNTY THEY ALSO LEVERAGE ARMATURE SAY WITH THEIR SCHOOL PARTNERS TO PROVIDE THERAPIST IN THE SCHOOLS LEVERAGING MHSAA EPS D. T. WHICH IS FULL SCOPE CHILDREN'S MEDIC HOW THEY DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION. AND THEY GET THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ANTE UP THAT IS AN AMAZING COLLABORATIVE THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE WITH OUR REGULAR SYSTEM OF CARE. MON COUNTY WHICH IS OF ANOTHER SMALL COUNTY THIRTEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FOLKS IN THIRTY ONE HUNDRED SQUARE MILES. AND THEY HAD AN ISSUE WITH ACCESS TO SERVICES SO THEY UTILIZE THEIR IMAGES A DOLLARS AND A C. SACK ORDERED PROJECT. TO WORK WITH THE BATON PAY YOU. NATIVE TRIBE AND THEY HAVE A PRO PROGRAM CALLED DINNER AND A MOVIE BUT IT DOES INVOLVE DINNER OR MOVIES SO AND JUST ONE MAKE SURE THAT'S CLEAR. WHERE IT REALLY IS ABOUT OPENING COMMUNITY DIALOGUE AND NOW THE TRIBAL ELDERS ARE THE ONES WHO AND NEW SHAPE THE DIALOGUE WITH NON NATIVE PEOPLE AS WELL AS OUR OWN USE AND WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN AS AN 85% INCREASE. IN TREATMENT SEEKING BY THIS POPULATION WHICH IS AMAZING. KERN COUNTY AND LIKE MANY OF OUR COUNTY IS HOW'S THAT FOR A FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP DEDICATED SPECIFICALLY O OUR SENIOR POPULATION CALLED WISE WELLNESS INDEPENDENT SENIOR IN RICHMOND. OUR SENIOR POPULATION CONTINUES TO GROW AND WE CONTINUE TO IGNORE IT AS A NATION THIS ABILITY FOR THEM TO UTILIZE IMAGE AS A DOLLARS TO LEVERAGE MEDI CAL AND MEDICARE. IS. IMPACTING THAT POPULATION IN A VERY POSITIVE MANNER. AND THEN OF COURSE THERE SAN BERNADINO COUNTY WE'VE BUILT AN ENTIRE CRISIS SYSTEM OF CARE UTILIZING AN HSA DOLLARS WE STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX. CREATING COMMUNITY CRISIS RESPONSE TEAMS THAT INCLUDE CLINICIANS FOR ADULTS CHILDREN ALCOHOL DRUG COUNSELORS AND PEER NAVIGATORS ALL FUNDED THROUGH AN HSA. THEY GO OUT TO COMMUNITY AND RESPOND TO ANY CRISIS AND I WILL TELL YOU WE ARE AMAZING AT IT WHICH IS HIGHLY UNFORTUNATE. WE HAD A TEAM AND AN INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE PRIOR TO OUR DECEMBER SECOND TERRORIST ATTACK OUR C. C. R. T. CRISIS RESPONSE TEAM WAS WHO WAS INITIATED WHO WE DEPLOYED. WHO FOR THE FIRST FORTY EIGHT HOURS OF THAT EVENT WE WERE ABLE TO THEN GET THREE HUNDRED CLINICAL BOOTS ON THE GROUND. IN PART BECAUSE OF THE M. HSA WE THEN WERE UTILIZING THAT KNOWLEDGE TO ASSIST WITH THE LAS VEGAS SHOOTING IN WHICH OUR COUNTY HAD SIX PEOPLE WHO WERE SHOT AND ONE PERSON WHO WAS MURDERED. TO PROVIDE CRISIS INTERVENTION TWO FAMILIES TO OUR COMMUNITIES. ANY FOLKS WOULD ATTENDED THAT EVENT WE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT WE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. IMPACT THE TRAJECTORY OF CRISIS WITHOUT MHSAA AND THEN MOST RECENTLY TO A RIDGE CREST TRONA EARTHQUAKE OF SIX POINT NINE AND SEVEN POINT ONE. OUR CRISIS RESPONSE TEAMS WERE THE FIRST OUT. AND THEY WERE OUT THERE FOR FOUR WEEKS. I IN A TOWN THAT HAD NO WATER. AND ALL OF OUR BUILDINGS EXCEPT OUR ONE COUNTY BUILDING WAS RED TAGGED. WE HAVE THE EXPERIENCE IN THAT BASED ON THE MHS A BEING ABLE TO FUND THOSE SERVICES. AND WE ADDED TO OUR CRISIS SYSTEM OF CARE WE LEVERAGE THE CHAFF A GRAND THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH FACILITIES AND FINANCING ASSOCIATION FUNDS. FOR MENTAL HEALTH WELLNESS UNDER SPD TWO. VIA THE CALIFORNIA TREASURER'S OFFICE. CAL SAMBAR YOU KNOW COUNTY WAS AWARDED TWENTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS WE LEVERAGE TWENTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF MHSAA. TO BUILD FACILITIES PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES. FROM THE MOST NORTHERN PART OF OUR COUNTY IN THE TOWN OF NEEDLES WHICH WOULD BE LAUGHLIN. THE ARIZONA NEVADA CALIFORNIA BORDER IF YOU WERE UP THERE HAVING A NICE SUMMER VACATION WITH YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR CHILD HAD A PSYCHIATRIC BREAK OR YOU I'LL RAN OUT OF YOUR MEDICATION AND HAD A PSYCHIATRIC CRISIS. YOU WILL DRIVE FIVE HOURS TO GET TO THE FIRST LIKE BAD. OUR COUNTY IS ABOUT LARGE AND WE HAVE NO PSYCHIATRIC. HOSPITAL SERVICES FROM THE TOWN OF VICTORVILLE ON UP TO THE CALIFORNIA NEVADA ARIZONA BORDER. SO WE WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. BUILT SIX FACILITIES FOR CRISIS A RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITIES AND TO CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS. WE HAVE DONE THAT WAS IN THE HIGH DESERT AND THE LOW DESERT AND IN OUR CENTRAL PART OF OUR COUNTY EACH CRISIS RESIDENTIAL HAS SIXTEEN BEDS. WE ARE AT 98% CAPACITY ALL THE TIME OUR C. S. USE OUR CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS ARE LIKE AN URGENT CARE WHERE YOU CAN GO AND RECEIVE CARE FOR TWENTY THREE HOURS UP TO TWENTY THREE HOURS WE HAVE TWENTY BEDS IN EACH OF THOSE FACILITIES. FOR DESIGNATED FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN EACH OF THOSE FACILITIES. AND IN THE SEVENTEEN MONTHS WE'VE BEEN OPEN FOR ONE FACILITY I CAN TELL YOU WE'VE DRAWN DOWN FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND FFE. IN ONE FACILITY. WE HAVE ALSO AS AM DIRECTOR EWING POINTS OUT WE ARE REALLY INVESTED IN TELLING OUR STORY AND I WILL BE THE FIRST TO SAY COUNTIES DON'T DO IT VERY WELL BECAUSE OUR BUSY. THAT'S TRULY THE REASON BUT IF WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR C. C. R. T. R. I. I'M SORRY AT OUR CRISIS RESIDENTIAL NOT CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS IN THE PAST YEAR. WITH THOSE OF SIX BASILIDES WE'VE REDUCED HOSPITAL AT AM. M. ET ADMISSIONS AND INPATIENT PSYCH USE BY 52% WE HAVE DECREASED LAW ENFORCEMENT INVOLVEMENT HI TOUCH LOW TOUCH BY 33% WE'VE INCREASED CLIENT PARTICIPATION AND OUTPATIENT SERVICES AFTER THE CRISIS AFTER DISCHARGE FROM OUR PROGRAM BY 40% AND HAVE A SATISFACTION RATE. WE HAVE LEVERAGE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION AND HAVE DONE SO AS MANY COUNTIES HAVE FOR YEARS BEFORE AN HSA P. E. I. IN PARTICULAR ALLOWS US TO INTERVENE EARLY. P. I. SPECIFIC YOU CAN'T HAVE A DIAGNOSIS TO USE P. E. I. FINDS AN EARLY INTERVENTION MEANS THAT YOU'RE INTERACTING WITH SOMEONE WHO MIGHT HAVE A DIAGNOSIS IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS SO WE'VE BEEN VERY FLEXIBLE AND CREATIVE WITH THAT. WE WORK WITH OUR SCHOOL SIMILAR TO YELLOW. IN DOING A SCREENING ASSESSMENT AND REFERRAL TO TREATMENT PROGRAM AS WELL AS AN EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND INTENSIVE SERVICES PROGRAM. FOUR ZERO TO FIVE FOLKS WE LEVERAGE FIRST FIVE LOCAL MATCH P. E. I. LOCAL MATCH FUNDING FROM A LOCAL SALPA. DESERT MOUNTAIN SPECIAL EDUCATION LOCAL PLANNING AREA THEY USE THEIR ELLIE EIGHT DOLLARS WE USE THE IP PST TEA AND WE DRIVE DOWN A FIFTY SO WE CAN MAKE THAT WORK NONE OF THOSE SERVICES WOULD BE A BILLABLE TO MEDIC COW. NOR WOULD THEY BE TO COMMERCIAL SERVICE TO COMMERCIAL INSURANCE. AND IN THOSE PROGRAMS WE SCREEN ALL OF OUR KIDS USING THE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EVENTS SCREENING TOOL. WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT 48% OF THE CHILDREN WHO ARE REFERRED FROM OUR PARTNER IN THE SCHOOL. HAVING A SCORE OF FOUR. THAT'S HIGH TWO IS HIGH. THESE ARE FOR. AND ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT CHANGE TRAUMA THAT'S ALREADY OCCURRED WE DO USE THE CHILD ADOLESCENT NEEDS SURVEY TOOL TO MONITOR WE DO THAT AND SIX MONTH INTERVALS AND POST DISCHARGE FROM PROGRAM. AND WE SAW THE RESILIENCY SCORES OF THOSE CHILDREN INCREASED BY 78% WE HAVE A LEVERAGE MHSAA TO ASSIST IN OUR HOMELESS ISSUE AN OUR COUNTY WE HAVE AN A SYSTEM OF CARE THAT INCLUDES OUR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WHO DO HOMELESS POLICING THEY DO IT IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDED STAFF WE RIDE ALONG TOGETHER. INTO ENCAMPMENTS OUT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE MOJAVE DESERT UNDERNEATH BRIDGES AND OVERPASSES WE LEVERAGE ALL OF OUR PARTNERS IN ORDER TO ATTEND TO BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT SOMEONE AND HOUSING IT IS NOT ENOUGH I'M A SOCIAL WORKER BY TRAINING IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO GIVE SOMEONE A HOME. WE ARE FOLKS NEED TO KNOW HOW TO STAY IN THAT HOME THEY NEED SUPPORT OF SERVICES TO DO SO WE ALSO FIND ARE COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEM FOR THE HOMELESS THIS ARE HOMELESS. PARTNERS THROUGH AN HSA. LIKE MANY COUNTIES WE ALSO FIND CRISIS INTERVENTION TREATMENT WHICH IS EDUCATION TO FIRST RESPONDERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ON WHAT MENTAL ILLNESS LOOKS LIKE AND HOW TO INTERVENE IF THEY COME IN CONTACT WITH SOMEONE WHO IS EXPERIENCING A MENTAL ILLNESS. IT IS A REQUIREMENT OF OUR SHERIFF'S ACADEMY THE EVERYONE WHO GOES THROUGH RECEIVES THIRTY HOURS OF THAT ALL FUNDED THROUGH AN HSA. WE OFFER THAT COURSE AGAIN TO OUR FIRE TO C. H. P. TO PROBATION. AND WE ALSO FIND STRIKE TEAMS TO WORK WITH OUR SHERIFF IN CUSTODY SO THAT THEY CAN DO A WARM HAND OFF OF FOLKS OR EXPERIENCE A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AS THEY LEAVE. THE JAIL SYSTEM SO THAT THEY CAN THEN BE ENGAGED IN OUTPATIENT SERVICES. AND NONE OF THESE SERVICES WOULD BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. AT LEAST TO THE BREADTH AND DEPTH IN WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO USE THEM NOW. AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO LEVERAGE OUR RELATIONSHIPS OTHER FUNDING SOURCES ARE COUNTIES EXPERIENCE OUR EXPERTISE AND OUR OUR PARTNER'S RELATIONSHIPS. THIS MHSAA HAS ALLOWED US AS A SYSTEM TO INTERRUPT A TRAJECTORY OF A PERSON'S MENTAL ILLNESS AND THAT IS INVALUABLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU INDICATE ALL OF OUR PANELISTS AND I JUST OPEN IT UP FOR ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISS SMITH. THANK YOU FOR THAT REALLY THOROUGH AND IMPRESSIVE TESTIMONY IT HELPS INFORM PARTICULARLY AND MEMBERS LIKE MYSELF WHO ARE NEW AND TO HOW THESE RESOURCES ARE USE AND VERY VERY INFORMATIVE BUT IN PARTICULAR MISS CABRERA MISS KAY KELLY YOU SPOKE ABOUT CAPACITY IN BAND WITH WHEN IT COMES TO CRISIS RESPONSE AND IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE THAT I'M A PART OF IT SOMETHING WE'VE EXAMINED I'M SURE ARE ARE THERE CHAIRMAN DOCTOR WOULD COULD SPEAK TO WHAT HIS COMMUNITY EXPERIENCED AND REALLY WANTING TO BE MINDFUL OF THE NEED TO RESPOND RAPIDLY TO EXPAND RESOURCES TO MOBILIZE RESOURCES BUT I THINK THE FACT THAT YOU POINTED OUT THAT THE PRUDENT RESERVE FUNDS ARE NOT ACCESSIBLE FOR THAT. SO IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT INCIDENTS WHERE YOU KNOW OR COUNTIES THAT MAYBE HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS AND WHAT YOU. WOULD RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DO IN RESPONSE. THANK YOU YEAH THE WAY THAT THE ACT IS WRITTEN CURRENTLY WE CAN REACH INTO THOSE PARDON RESERVES FOR STATEWIDE EAT ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS BUT OUR COUNTY SO POINTED OUT THAT. IT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL IF WE COULD ALSO REACH AND FOR LOCAL DISASTERS AND EMERGENCIES AND- UP YOU KNOW JUST AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IN AGAIN IN SOME OF OUR SMALLER COUNTIES THEY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM OF UNSPENT M. H. C. THEY ARE USING IT ALL. AND SO IT YOU KNOW WHEN A LOCAL DISASTER STRIKES ARE ONE OF THE SMALLER COUNTIES THE ABILITY TO USE WHAT IS NOW BEING SET UP WHICH IS THE PRUDENT RESERVE UNDER THERE CURRENTLY LEGAL STRUCTURE WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANTED TO AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. WE ARE USING AN HSA FOR THAT BUT IT'S OTHER COUNTIES MHSAA SO THAT OUR COUNTY HAS RESPONDED TO. CINEMA TO NOW BUT TO BE YOU WE'VE GONE OUT WHEN THE FIRES HAVE HAPPENED WE'VE GONE TO OTHER STATES UTILIZING. THE FUNDING HERE AND IT IS OFTEN TIMES THERE IS ARE THERE A FEDERAL AVENUES TO DO THIS AND- THOSE ARE TIMELY THE FEDS DON'T KNOW WHAT. THE CINEMA COUNTY LOOKS LIKE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT PARADISE IS AND SO THE ABILITY FOR US AS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS WE REACH OUT ACTUALLY THAT'S HOW WE DO IT WE THERE IS A FORMALIZED PROCESS AND UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES. THAT TAKES TOO LONG SO WE'VE JUST REACHED OUT CELLPHONE THE CELL PHONE TO SAY CAN YOU DEPLOY A TEAM HERE BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES THE CRISIS IS IMPACTING THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PROVIDING CRISIS RESPONSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT DIALOGUE THAT WE'RE HAVING AND- TO ATTEST TO THE- HOW. THE PROCESS IS WORKING THE RETURN ON THE MONEY THIS COMING THROUGH THE STATE. WAS ELOQUENTLY OF SPOKEN AS FAR AS- THE DIFFERENT CRISIS RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS THAT ARE THERE. AND JUST TO ADD TO THE IMPORTANCE. OF LOCAL CRISIS WHEN COUNTIES ARE ASKED TO. BUILD THESE RESERVES BUT ONLY BE ABLE TO USE THEM ON STATEWIDE ECONOMIC FACTORS. LOCAL ISSUES HAPPEN WE WERE ON THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS CHAIRMAN DURING DECEMBER SECOND. AND THAT ALLOWED THE CRISIS TEAM TO GET THERE QUICKLY TO START TO GIVE THAT NECESSARY. TREATMENT THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE BUT IT ALSO SHOWED. OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE AND THE WILLING OF RESOURCES TO BE SHARED WITHIN SEMINAL COUNTY TO MAKE SURE THAT. THOSE PROCESSES WERE TAKING CARE OF AND YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IT CAME TO THAT AID SHOWS THE NETWORKING AND HOW THE STATE CAN RESPOND TO THOSE AREAS. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW THE CRISIS RESIDENTIAL AREAS WE TALK ABOUT SAM YOU KNOW COUNTY HAS ALL THE RURAL THE SUBURBAN AND URBAN COMPONENTS OF SALMON YOU KNOW COUNTY. AND TALKING ABOUT NEEDLES AND HOW FAR YOU WOULD HAVE TO DRIVE TO GET FIRST THE FIRST TREATMENT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN'T OVER LOOK WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THOSE THINGS. CRISIS RESIDENTIAL I pBELIEVE ON THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WERE THERE AND IN THIS POSITION HERE WE SPEAK UP ON THOSE ISSUES I THINK CRISIS STABILIZATION. HAVE A COMPONENT THAT CONTINUES TO BE MAY BE OVERLOOKED AS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE BEFORE WE GET TO WHERE WE'RE AT IN A CRISIS SITUATION CRISIS SITUATION OF EMERGENCY ROOMS CRISIS SITUATIONS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVING TO TAKE PEOPLE INTO JAILS WHICH IS ONE OF THE- PRIORITIES RIGHT LOOKING AT. HOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE NOT HAVING MENTAL HEALTH INDIVIDUALS NOW HAVING TO GO THROUGH THAT CYCLE OF JAIL OR AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM THEY THEY SERVE A PURPOSE WE DID ADVOCATE AND SUCCESSFULLY GOT A CRISIS STABILIZATION UNIT OUT IN JOSHUA TREE ON OUR LINE AREA RULE PART OF THE COMMUNITY SAMBIA COUNTY HAS SERVED. THE PURPOSE IT WAS THERE IN SHORT THE MERITS OF THOSE AS FAR AS DATA THAT IS BEING SHOWN HERE SHOWS THAT THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BUT THE STORY OF THAT ACCOUNTABILITY GETTING TO THE LEGISLATURE IS WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT MESSAGE IS BEING HEARD HOWEVER AT THE COUNTY LEVEL YOU'RE WORKING VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE YOUR LEVERAGING THE DOLLARS MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE GOING AFTER. THESE DIFFERENT AREAS AND IN THE COMMUNITY ITSELF SO. IT'S GOOD THAT YOU YOU. BRING THAT OVER I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT IT. THE LOCAL ATMOSPHERE THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES OF ALL FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTIES. IT CHANGES THROUGHOUT THE AREAS AS CHAIRMAN WOULD ALLUDED TO HIS REPRESENTS WORLD COMMUNITIES SO WHAT'S THE NEED THERE RIGHT IS THERE TRULY. UP A ONE PIECE FITS ALL TYPE OF APPROACH TO THIS AND THE ANSWER. IS NOW BUT THE NEED IS THERE SO HOW DO YOU ADJUST THE NEED. TO THE ACTUAL COUNTIES THAT ARE THERE ITSELF. I'M A BIG PROPONENT OF CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS AND I SAY STIPE STABILIZATION YEARS BECAUSE THAT'S THE FIRST. IMPACT THE FIRST THE LINE OF DEFENSE BEFORE YOU GET TO THE CRISIS RESIDENTIAL BEFORE YOU GET TO THE INCARCERATION BEFORE YOU GET TO THE SITUATION WHAT WE SEE SO MANY RATHER ITS ROLE OR OR LARGE. COUNTIES THAT ARE THERE YOU SEE THAT THE HOMELESS POPULATION. BUT WITHIN THAT HOMELESS POPULATION THERE'S A SUB POPULATION OF THOSE THAT HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. IF WE COULD FOCUS ON AND WE DID THIS AT THE COUNTY FOCUSED ON SUB POPULATIONS ARE BRINGING RESOURCES TO THEM. THERE WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AN EFFECT IN A MEASUREMENT BASED ON THE SUB POPULATION THAT'S THEIR- MENTAL HEALTH. CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF THE- BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AS A LECTOR LEADERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND NOW AT THE STATE WIDE AREA OR ELSE YOU WOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS JOINT HEARING DISCUSSING THESE TOPICS THAT ARE FACING. THE POPULATION ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT CRISIS STABILIZATION CRISIS RESIDENTIAL. WE'VE BEEN IN IN SITUATIONS WHERE WE ACTUALLY SEE IT WORK. WE SEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM FAR OUT THERE IN THE DESERT FROM JOSHUA TREE WHO HAD TO TAKE. AN INDIVIDUAL INTO IT A COUNTY HEALTH FACILITY OR THE COUNTY JAIL TWO HOURS TRAVELING. TAKE SOME OFF OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES ARE THERE CRISIS STABILIZATION UNIT DEPENDING ON THE SEVERITY. YOU'RE ABLE TO GET THEM TO THE CRISIS STABILIZATION UNIT AND STABILIZE INDIVIDUAL GETTING THOSE RESOURCES BACK OUT NOT CLOGGING THE EMERGENCY ROOMS AND NOT CLOGGING UP COUNTY JAILS OF THOSE THAT ARE SUFFERING. FROM RIGHT FROM FROM THIS EPISODE IMAGES. ESCALATE THE SITUATION ITSELF. SO THAT THERE IS A BIG A NEED FOR THAT AND WE CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR THOSE AREAS IN THERE IS TRUE MEASUREMENT. TO SEE THAT MOVE FORWARD. AND THAT'S DEALING WITH IN THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND HOW WE MOVE THAT FORWARD. AND I WANT TO BRING FOR AND I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP ON THAT THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES OF BATON IN PARTICULAR. WE KNOW THAT WITHIN THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES THERE IS A TRIBAL COMMUNITIES ARE THERE AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS THAT WE SEE IT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE STATISTICS OF NATIVE AMERICANS IS HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE WITH IN THOSE AREAS RIGHT SO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE REACHING OUT WHEN I TALK ABOUT. CRISIS STABILIZATION CRISIS RESIDENTIAL WE'RE TALKING ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE WHOLE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND THAT DOES INCLUDE THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. SO WE HEARD OUT REACH THOSE DONE AT THE BATON I BELIEVE. BUT WE DIDN'T HEAR. IN AN IN DEPTH IN IN SOME OF THE OTHER DIALOGUE AND I WOUD ENCOURAGE. THAT WE CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE. BECAUSE IF WE'RE TRULY TALKING ABOUT. LORRAINE AND ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES. HOW CAN WE OVERLOOK A POPULATION THAT HAS A HIGHER DATA STATISTIC THAN ANY OTHER GROUP IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE ABOUT THAT. AND TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MORE WE CAN DO. AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY. TO CONTINUE TO GIVE YOU THE CAPABILITIES TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THOSE AREAS. BUT ALSO. COMING FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL WE DO SEE. THE DATA AND THE STATISTICS AND THE OUTCOMES THAT WERE THERE I THINK THAT STORY. NEEDS TO TRANSLATE INTO THE DIFFERENT BRIEFINGS WE GET THE SUCCESSFUL MODELS WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED AT THE COUNTY WE SEEN A SUCCESSFUL MODEL WITH A HOMELESS VETERAN POPULATION ARE HOMELESS WOMEN ON THE STREETS RIGHT AND ARE HOMELESS YOUTH AND IN SEMINOLE COUNTY. BUT IT'S BY TACKLING THOSE SUB POPULATIONS AND I THINK NOW GETTING THE SYNERGY AND IN THE ATMOSPHERE AROUND OUR MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT IN TACKLING THAT. TO SHOW. THE RESULTS OF THAT WORK IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU CONTINUE TO PUT INTO THE BRIEFINGS BECAUSE I KNOW COUNTIES ARE WORKING HARD. COUNTIES ARE WORKING HARD TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BUT YET THOSE SUCCESS STORIES. ARE FAR IN BETWEEN OF GETTING TO THE LEVEL OF THE BRIEFINGS WERE AT NOT TODAY UMMER THANK YOU FOR THAT AND REALLY ENCOURAGE. MORE OF THOSE A CRISIS STABILIZATION PRICES RESIDENTIAL BUT MORE DIALOGUE TO WITH THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION BECAUSE IF THOSE STATISTICS CONTINUE TO CLIMB. THEN WHAT WE TRULY DOING TO CURB THE WHOLE ELEMENT HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VENTURE THANK YOU I SENT A MEMBER AROMAS I BEFORE WE CLOSE DOCTOR WOULD ANY OTHER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. JUST JUST WITH REGARDS TO DISASTERS I'M KIND OF CURIOUS ABOUT HIM AND OBVIOUSLY COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH IN. THERE THERE WEREN'T AND IF I'M WRONG PLEASE SOMEONE CORRECT ME BUT- IN THE IN THE MAJOR FIRES THAT KEPT THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CATAMOUNT MET MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BUT THAT WASN'T DESTROYED. IN THE FIRES HOWEVER CLINICS THAT PROVIDED SERVICES THROUGH MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS OR OR ACTUALLY OR FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS EXCUSE ME. WORD DESTROYED AND SO IT BECAME PROBLEMATIC. FOR THEM TO PROVIDE SERVICES OUTSIDE THEIR EXISTING FOUR WALLS BECAUSE I'M SORRY THAT'S A FRASER PRYCE SHOULD USE THEIR MEN. OUTSIDE THEIR BUILDINGS BECAUSE THAT WASN'T THE LICENSE FACILITIES SO AND THAT YOU KNOW THAT MEANT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE GETTING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THESE FACILITIES WERE NET WORTH ETS EASILY ABLE TO ACCESS THEM AS QUICKLY AS THEY SHOULD SO. ANYBODY HAVE THOUGHTS ON THAT ONE BECAUSE THAT WAS I I'LL GIVE THE EXAMPLE. VISTA CLINIC IN IN SANTA ROSA AT HOME TO TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND PATIENTS. BUT DESTROYED AND THAT'S MORE OR LESS DESTROYED BUT THEY WERE REALLY STRUGGLING WITH GETTING REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES. YES COUPLE THINGS WE UNFORTUNATELY ARE WELL PRACTICED NOW AT HELPING THE COUNTIES WHEN THERE IS A DISASTER IN TERMS OF RECEIVING WHEN THERE'S A FIFTH OF. A DECLARED DISASTER AND APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE ARE CRISIS OF FUNDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE COUNTIES FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND LIKE I SAID UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE BECOME. ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD AT HELPING THE COUNTIES GET THOSE FUNDS IN A TIMELY WAY AND THEY HAVE A VIEW I BELIEVE A YEAR OR SO ONCE THAT I DID. ONCE THEY CAN EXPEND THE FUNDS FOR UP TO A YEAR AFTER THE DISASTER HAS BEEN DECLARED. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY IF THERE ARE CONTINUING NEED WE HAVE I THINK WORKED WITH ONE PARTICULAR COUNTY IN IT PROBABLY WAS AFTER THE CINEMA FIRES WHERE THE FUNDS WERE CONTINUED AFTER THAT ONE YEAR PERIOD. THERE ARE ALSO OPPORTUNITIES UNDER. FEDERALLY APPROVED DISASTERS IN WHICH WE CAN APPLY FOR WAIVERS IN WHICH SERVICES CAN BE PROVIDED AN ALTERNATE SETTINGS. THAT WAS ALSO NOTED IN THE CINEMA FIRE WHERE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY RESIDENTS FOR HAVING TO BE RELOCATED TO EITHER SHELTERS SOMEWHERE IN LIBRARIES. OR OTHER ALTERNATE SITES AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FACILITY STAFF CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND CONTINUE TO DELIVER CARE WE WERE ABLE TO GET FUNDING FOR THAT. WE ARE I THINK PURSUING A CHANGE TO OUR STATE PLAN THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR SERVICES AND DECLARED DISASTERS TO BE PROVIDED OUTSIDE OF THE CLINIC SHOULD THE CLINIC BE TAKEN OFFLINE AND SO. I THINK. THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA BEING WHAT IT IS AND THE FUTURE BEING WHAT IT MOST LIKELY WILL CONTINUE TO BE IS THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO KIND OF MAKE STEPS AND REFINEMENTS. TO ALLOW FOR THOSE PROCESSES TO OCCUR WHEN A DISASTER UNFORTUNATELY TAKES PLACE IN SO I THINK. WE'RE HOPING NOT TO USE IT BUT WE ARE WE'RE TAKING THE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO ADDRESS IT. CAN I JUST HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR DEPUTY DIRECTOR I. CABRERA PART SORRY GREEN LUSH DEPUTY DIRECTOR AGREE LASH ATSU BASED ON THE GOVERNOR'S VISION GOVERNOR NUISANCE VISION FOR IMPROVING CALIFORNIA'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM I TWO QUESTIONS FIRST KNOW WHAT YOUR VISION FOR THE DH CS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH UNIT AND WHAT ROLE DO YOU ENVISION AND THAT CHECK AN HSA PLANE. AS PART OF THAT TRANSFORMATION SO ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION ASSISTANT DEPUTY SO I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR A YEAR AND A HALF RIGHT I WAS A DIRECTOR CAN'T JUST MENTIONED DR KELLY PFEIFFER IS NOW OUR AD DIFFUSE DIRECTOR SO UNFORTUNATELY SHE COULDN'T BE HERE WITH US TODAY SHE'S PROBABLY LISTENING TO US RIGHT NOW. OPTIONS THAT ARE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CONFERENCE BUT I THINK YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF OUR DEPARTMENT'S VISION YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT I THINK WITH OUR RE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT WE'VE JUST RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED IT KIND OF SPREADS OUT THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES WE ARE GOING TO BE MORE STREAMLINED AND BE MORE EFFICIENT. WE WERE VERY TOP HEAVY AND I WAS LIKE VERY DEEP DOWN IN TERMS OF THE WAY OUR STRUCTURE I WAS WITH MEDI CAL AND NON MEDICAL WE PULLED OUT A PART AND SO DOCTOR PFEIFFER WILL BE OVER THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT AREA AND SO AND THEN WITH ALL OF THE RECENT RESOURCES THAT WE'VE JUST RECEIVED A THIRTEEN PETITION THAT DIRECTOR CANNOT JUST MENTIONING. I'M WE'VE GOT AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD OUT OUR OVERSIGHT SH SURE AND TO REALLY FOCUS ON THINKING YOU KNOW ABOUT OUR POLICIES AND SPEND TIME WITH THE COUNTIES WITH THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION OR OTHER STAKEHOLDERS SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT'S A- GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO THINK BROADLY AND WITH OUR OTHER PARTNERS AND OTHER SYSTEMS BECAUSE THAT'S ANOTHER AREA WHERE I THINK WE'RE I'M REALLY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH. OUR CONTINUE WORKING WITH SOCIAL SERVICES OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE PARTNERS TO REALLY STRENGTHEN OUR COUNTY SYSTEMS AND REALLY. LOOKING AT HOW MEDICARE ON NON MEDICARE ALL THE. FULL PICTURE CAN SUPPORT COUNTY IS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF YOU KNOW THE SERVICES THAT CAN. ARE REALLY IMPROVE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WERE MOST IMPACTED AND NOT JUST FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY THINKING BROADLY. JUST BE ON MENTAL HEALTH AND REALLY LOOKING AT THE WHOLE PERSON AND AN ACTUAL PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE AS WELL SO.

AND YET FOURTEEN YEARS LATER THERE REALLY IS STILL NOT A SHARED UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE STATE WIDE OUTCOME SHOULD BE ACROSS ALL OF THE IMAGE TO SAY COMPONENTS SO WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THAT. ANOTHER AREA OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO US IS THE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION COMPONENT THE 20% OF THE I MEAN TO SAY THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IT IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVENE EARLIER IN THE COURSE OF SOMEBODY'S ILLNESS.

REPRESENTATIVES HAVE RAISED CURRENTLY MORE THAN A DOZEN FIRST FIVE IN COUNTY BEHAVIORAL AGENCIES ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO PREVENT.

THANK YOU FOR TODAY'S HEARING MY NAME'S ELIZABETH OF SECURE AND I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION WE WERE WE REPRESENT MORE THAN THIRTEEN HUNDRED HEALTH CENTERS. AND ABOUT SIX POINT NINE MILLION PATIENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATES. ABOUT PROVIDE. COLOCATED PRIMARY CARE BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES. HEALTH CENTERS TAKEN APPROACH TO CARE THAT LOOKS AT THE NEEDS OF THE WHOLE PERSON AND TRY. TO APPROACH THAT CARE AND THAT WAY. CPC IS A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF SB SIXTY SIX AND THIS WOULD ALLOW WE ENFORCEMENT FOR SAME DAY VISITS FOR BEHAVIOR HEALTH AND PRIMARY CARE. INSTEAD OF FORCING PATIENTS TO COME BACK FOR. ANOTHER DAY TO RECEIVE THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH VISITS IF THE HOUSE AND I CAN'T AFFORD TO PROVIDE A ON THE SAME DAY WITHOUT REIMBURSEMENTS. A SAFETY NET PROVIDERS WE PROVIDE CARE TO DIVERSE POPULATIONS WE HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMELESS POP YOU. HOMELESS PATIENTS AND AT LEAST THIRTY FIVE PATIENTS THAT HAVE IDENTIFIED ANOTHER ENGLISH AND OTHER LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AS THEIR PRIMARY LANGUAGE. SO HOWEVER WE ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT ONLY ABOUT NINE COUNTIES HAVE ACCEPTED IT TO PARTNER WITH HEALTH CENTERS TO PROVIDE HERE WERE HEALTH SERVICES TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AND IT WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THIS ON WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SERVING COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE AND BELIEVE THAT HEALTH CENTERS COULD BE A LEVERAGE POINT FOUR COUNTIES TO MAKE SURE THAT SERVICES ARE REACHING.

MADAM CHAIR MISTER CHAIR MARKETS CUSTOMER THE CALIFORNIA PENTA THINK HEALTH NETWORK A STATEWIDE MULTICULTURAL HEALTH ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION COMMUTES THE COLOR AND LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO FACE BARRIERS ACCESSING MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND STILL FACE SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES IN MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES MHSAA PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO FOCUS ON THE ISSUES TO ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY IN OUR PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY IS CURRENTLY ADMINISTERING A SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM THE CALIFORNIA REDUCING DISPARITIES PROJECT WAS THE RDP. WHICH IS FUNDED BY THE M. HSA THE CRT P. IS OF ITS FUNDING AND TESTING NEW STRATEGIES TO SERVE TO ME AS A COLOR AND THE LGBT COMMUNITY HOWEVER THERE IS CURRENTLY NO PLAN TO SUSTAIN THIS. WORK AND INTEGRATE THE SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIES THAT THERE HAVE. HAVE HAVE COME FROM THAT PROJECT INTO THE BROADER MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM ONCE THE FUNDING RUNS OUT.

CHAIR WITH DO YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING REMARKS YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE YEAH FOR FIRST OF ALL JUST THANK YOU TO EVERYONE FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION TODAY OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A PRETTY COMPLICATED ISSUE THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE DELIVERY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE NOT EASY TO SOLVE THAT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS BUT I BELIEVE IT'S TIME FOR A DIFFERENT MINDSET AROUND MENTAL HEALTH AND THE ACCOMPANYING ISSUES. OF INCARCERATION AND STIGMA SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND HOMELESSNESS. IT IT IT FEELS TO ME LIKE WE'VE GOT THESE SILOS WHEN I HEARD YOU SAY. DOCTOR THAT WE YOU WE CAN'T USE THEM AS A M. AT MHS MUCH A MONEY WITH FOR PEOPLE WHO S. ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES OKAY I UNDERSTAND THAT THE MONEY ASIDE IS NOT MEANT FOR THAT BUT IT ALSO BEGS THE QUESTION YOU KNOW HOW DO WE HOW DO WE REALLY BRING TOGETHER ALL OF THESE ISSUES WHICH WHICH IN MANY CASES IT IN MANY INDIVIDUALS ARE TIED TOGETHER. I THINK OF THIS IS WILL PROBABLY A STRANGE ANALOGY BUT I THINK OF YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL WE HAD CONTRACTORS COME TOGETHER TO BUILD A PROJECT WE HAD THE FIRE DEPARTMENT YOU HAD THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAD THE ELECTRIC UTILITY AND THEY ALL TOOK THEY ALL THEY ALL TOOK THEIR BITE AT THE APPLE UNTIL WE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO BRING THEM ALL TO THE TABLE. TO LOOK AT THE PROBLEM MORE HOLISTICALLY LIKE WHAT I HEAR ABOUT WITH THE COUNTY WITH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS. AND SO I YOU KNOW WE HE WE TALK WE HAVE SO MUCH TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS AND- AND BUT THERE'S SO MANY ISSUES THAT THAT LEAD TO THAT. I'D I LONG FOR THE DAY WHEN WE COULD HAVE ALL THE PLAYERS AT THE TABLE TO REALLY LOOK AT THIS HOLISTICALLY AND IF I'M MISSING IF THERE'S THAT IF THAT'S OUT THERE HAPPENING NOW I'D LOVE. TO KNOW ABOUT IT. BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN IT AND I THINK WE'RE MISSING A HUGE OPPORTUNITY. SO YEAH BETWEEN THE HEARINGS SO WE'VE HAD THIS YEAR TODAY'S HEARING I THINK WE HAVE LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR. MANY MORE HEARINGS QUITE FRANKLY. BUT I AND I HOPE THE DYNAMICS THAT SURROUND THESE ISSUES YOU KNOW BEGIN TO SHIFT. THE WAY WE APPROACH THEM AND I LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE HEARINGS AS WE DELVE DEEPER INTO THESE ISSUES AND- AND HOW DO WE BETTER SERVE. THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR- PEOPLE OF OUR STATE.
