PRIORITY IS CLIMATE RESILIENCE.

00:10:35.501 --> 00:10:37.536
THAT PICTURE I IN TOP LEFT

00:10:37.603 --> 00:10:38.904
CORNER IS ACTUALLY THE

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:39.872
CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS.

00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:43.843
PUTTING. THROUGH THE SALMON

00:10:43.909 --> 00:10:46.012
RESTORATION PROGRAM WHICH IS A

00:10:46.078 --> 00:10:47.346
FORTY YEAR PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:50.349
THE- NOT PART OF FISH AND

00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:52.218
WILDLIFE. THE SECOND PRIORITY

00:10:52.284 --> 00:10:54.420
IS PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY WILL

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:55.821
TALK A LOT TODAY ABOUT

00:10:55.888 --> 00:10:57.890
ENDANGERED SPECIES OF FISH.

00:10:57.957 --> 00:10:59.625
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE NEED TO

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:01.427
CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON. KEEPING

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:02.728
SPECIES ALIVE THAT ARE ON THE

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:04.096
BRINK OF EXTINCTION. AT THE

00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:05.631
SAME TIME I THINK WE AT THE

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:06.632
STATE CAN DO MUCH MORE

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:09.468
UPSTREAM. TO KEEP PLANTS AND

00:11:09.535 --> 00:11:10.436
ANIMALS ARE HEALTHY SO THAT

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:11.771
THEY AREN'T. ON THE BRINK OF

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:13.839
EXTINCTION- MANY DON'T KNOW

00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:15.641
THAT WE HAVE MORE VARIETY. MORE

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:17.543
DIVERSITY OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.378
AND ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY.

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:21.414
AND WE'RE ACTUALLY CONSIDERED

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:21.847
ONE OF THE- WORLD'S

00:11:21.914 --> 00:11:23.916
BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS. AND SO I

00:11:23.983 --> 00:11:25.985
AM FOCUSED ON TRYING TO.

00:11:26.052 --> 00:11:27.520
RESHAPE A LOT OF OUR

00:11:27.586 --> 00:11:29.188
INVESTMENTS IN PROGRAMS WITH A

00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:29.755
SPECIFIC FOCUS ON HOW DO WE

00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:31.490

00:11:44.937 --> 00:11:45.838
I THINK THAT MANIFESTS OUR

00:11:45.905 --> 00:11:46.772
AGENCY. IN THEM CALIFORNIANS

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:48.240

OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US THIS IS

00:12:49.535 --> 00:12:51.403
THE LONG TERM DECLINE IN OUR

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.105
SALMON POPULATIONS SO ON THE

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:56.242
LEFT- IS- THE BASELINE AVERAGE

00:12:56.308 --> 00:12:59.178
FROM NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN TO

00:12:59.245 --> 00:12:59.778

THOSE LINES ARE REPRESENTS A

00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:08.320
DIFFERENT SPECIES OF SALMON.

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:24.904
WRONG DIRECTION. I THINK OUR

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.974
GOAL HAS TO BE- TO PIVOT. I AND

00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:31.243
TO RESTORETHE FISHERY. YOU

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.479
ASKED ABOUT A- UPDATE TO THE

00:13:33.546 --> 00:13:35.080
SALMON DOUBLING GOAL THAT WE

00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:37.316
ARE PROPOSING- WITHIN THIS

00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:38.217
DISCUSSION OF ALLEN TERRY

00:13:38.284 --> 00:13:40.920
AGREEMENTS- AND IT IS

00:13:40.986 --> 00:13:42.922
SPECIFICALLY TO DOUBLE- THE

00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:44.590
AMOUNT OF SALMON FROM THAT BASS

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:47.960
LINE- BY TWENTY FIFTY- YOU ALL

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:51.430
PROBABLY KNOW THAT- THE CENTRAL

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:53.332
VALLEY PROJECT IMPROVEMENT ACT.

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:54.466
ARE REQUIRED THAT THE SECRETARY

00:13:54.533 --> 00:13:56.235
OF INTERIOR DEVELOP A PROGRAM

00:13:56.302 --> 00:13:57.570
TO MAKE ALL EASONABLE EFFORTS

00:13:57.636 --> 00:14:01.307
TO DOUBLE THE POPULATION. THAT

00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:03.676
BASELINE POPULATION BY TWO

00:14:03.742 --> 00:14:04.410
THOUSAND TWO. BUT OBVIOUSLY THE

00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:06.879
STATE. MOVED IN THE WRONG

00:14:06.946 --> 00:14:08.881
DIRECTION SO FOR THE LAST

00:14:08.948 --> 00:14:09.715
FIFTEEN YEARS THERE'S BEEN A

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:11.050
SALMON DOUBLING GOAL THAT SORT

00:14:11.116 --> 00:14:12.251
OF FLOATING OUT THERE IN THE

00:14:12.318 --> 00:14:14.420
ETHER WITHOUT A DATE TO TARGET

00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:15.454
TO HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:17.256
TO. IMAGINE A GREENHOUSE GAS

00:14:17.323 --> 00:14:19.391
REDUCTION GOAL THAT SAID 50%

00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:21.393
OF- REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.229
EMISSIONS PERIOD. WELL THE

00:14:23.295 --> 00:14:25.197
QUESTION IS BY WHEN AND HOW DO

00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:26.899
WE ACTUALLY ESTABLISH A PLAN

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:28.667
WITHOUT OR TARGET WITHOUT A

00:14:28.734 --> 00:14:30.636
DATE. SO WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:32.671
THE TWENTY FIFTY IS AMBITIOUS

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:34.840
GIVEN THAT- SHARP INCLINE IN

00:14:34.907 --> 00:14:36.642
THE FACT THAT WE AFTER INVERT-

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:38.877
THE TRAJECTORY. BUT WE ACTUALLY

00:14:38.944 --> 00:14:40.312
THINK THAT IT'S DOABLE AND IT

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:42.047
GIVES US A THIRTY YEAR WINDOW-

00:14:42.114 --> 00:14:44.149
ON WHICH TO DEVELOP A PLAN I'LL

00:14:44.216 --> 00:14:45.184
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY

00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:46.252
WERE BULLISH ON VOLUNTARY

00:14:46.318 --> 00:14:48.087
AGREEMENTS AND WE THINK THE

00:14:48.153 --> 00:14:49.555
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS WHICH- AS

00:14:49.622 --> 00:14:51.090
DISCUSSED ARE FIFTEEN YEARS AND

00:14:51.156 --> 00:14:52.858
LÏNG. ARE ACTUALLY WOULD

00:14:52.925 --> 00:14:55.227
WOULD MOVE US- BACK UP THE

00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:57.062
TRAJECTORY TOWARD THAT THAT

00:14:57.129 --> 00:14:58.564
DOUBLING GOAL I CAN TALK A

00:14:58.631 --> 00:14:59.665
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT IF

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.934
YOU WANT TO GO INTO DEPTH. ON

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:05.271
THAT. SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:07.072
WHAT WE NEED TO RECOVER OUR

00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:09.208
SALMON POPULATIONS GOES WITHOUT

00:15:09.275 --> 00:15:11.744
SAYING WE HAVE TO RESTORE FLOWS

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.646
IN RIVERS IN THE BAY DELTA I

00:15:13.712 --> 00:15:15.681
THINK EVERYBODY FROM WHEREVER

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:17.249
YOU ARE I IN THE ON THE

00:15:17.316 --> 00:15:19.151
SPECTRUM OF WATER STAKEHOLDERS

00:15:19.218 --> 00:15:21.253
AGREES ON THAT WE HAVE TO ALSO

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.755
DO A LOT OF OTHER THINGS I

00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:24.957
IMPROVING AND EXPANDING HABITAT

00:15:25.024 --> 00:15:27.359
WE'VE LOST- MUCH OF OUR- SALMON

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:29.161
SPAWNING IN REARING HABITAT-

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:30.496
OVER THE YEARS WERE

00:15:30.562 --> 00:15:31.697
INCREASINGLY MOVING WATER

00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:33.332
THROUGH THESE THESE CHANNELIZED

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:35.367
RIVERS THAT HAVE LOST THAT

00:15:35.434 --> 00:15:37.670
THEIR NATURAL FLOWS- WE NEED

00:15:37.736 --> 00:15:40.339
TO- PRIORITIZE APPROPRIATE DAM

00:15:40.406 --> 00:15:42.241
REMOVALS INCLUDING THE KLAMATH

00:15:42.308 --> 00:15:44.410
RIVER DAMS. AND BARRIERS TO

00:15:44.476 --> 00:15:46.011
FISH PASSAGE WHICH STRUCK COULD

00:15:46.078 --> 00:15:48.180
TALK MORE ABOUT WE NEED TO

00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:49.748
CONTROL INVASIVE SPECIES

00:15:49.815 --> 00:15:50.983
OBVIOUSLY CONTROVERSIAL THIS

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.651
QUESTION ABOUT THE EXTENT TO

00:15:52.718 --> 00:15:53.819
WHICH INVASIVE SPECIES LIKE

00:15:53.886 --> 00:15:55.587
STRIPED BASS ARE ACTUALLY-

00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:57.456
IMPACTING SALMON POPULATIONS

00:15:57.523 --> 00:15:58.490
BUT I THINK WE RIGHT I

00:15:58.557 --> 00:15:59.391
RECOGNIZE THAT CONTROLLING

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:01.593
THOSE POPULATIONS IS ONE THING

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.062
THAT WE HAVE TO DO. WE ALSO

00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:03.629
HAVE TO IMPROVE OCEAN

00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:05.197
CONDITIONS WE'LL TALK A LOT

00:16:05.264 --> 00:16:06.231
TODAY ABOUT THE HEALTH OF OUR

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:08.100
RIVERS BUT WE KNOW ON THE SAM

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:10.035
AND I REALIZE ON THEHEALTH OF

00:16:10.102 --> 00:16:11.670
OUR FRESH WATER ECOSYSTEMS AND

00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:13.605
ARE OCEAN BASED ECOSYSTEMS. I'M

00:16:13.672 --> 00:16:15.107
REALLY EXCITED WITH THE-

00:16:15.174 --> 00:16:17.109
STRATEGY FOR OCEANS AND COAST

00:16:17.176 --> 00:16:18.544
THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE AND-

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:19.678
MYSELF AND THE OCEAN

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:21.580
PROTECTION- COUNCIL JUST

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:23.982
APPROVED WHICH ACTUALLY HAS. A

00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:25.918
BUNCH OF INVESTMENTS IN

00:16:25.984 --> 00:16:26.952
PRIORITIES TO IMPROVE OCEAN

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:30.856
BIG. BASS WE ALSO NEED TO.

00:16:30.923 --> 00:16:32.725
UTILIZE BETTER NEW ACTIONABLE

00:16:32.791 --> 00:16:34.660
SCIENCE WE SPENT TENS OF

00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:36.962
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON SCIENCE-

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:38.530
OF THE HEALTH OF OUR WATERWAYS

00:16:38.597 --> 00:16:39.932
INCLUDING FISHERIES BUT TOO

00:16:39.998 --> 00:16:41.233
OFTEN IT'S WHAT I CALL COME

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.102
COMPLIANCE SCIENCE OR WORSE YET

00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:46.305
COMBAT SCIENCE WHAT WE NEED IS-

00:16:46.372 --> 00:16:47.639
SCIENTIFIC MONITORING AND

00:16:47.706 --> 00:16:49.308
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT IS

00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:51.643
TRANSPARENT AND THEN INFORMS

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.645
ARE MANAGEMENT WHICH HAS TO BE

00:16:53.712 --> 00:16:55.247
ADAPTIVE WE CAN'T LOCK

00:16:55.314 --> 00:16:56.515
OURSELVES IN THE THESE DECADE

00:16:56.582 --> 00:16:58.650
OLD MANAGEMENT DECISIONS AND

00:16:58.717 --> 00:17:00.919
MANAGED THROUGH. REGULATORY

00:17:00.986 --> 00:17:02.688
DECISIONS THAT GET CHANGED ONCE

00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:04.356
A DECADE OR LITIGATION THAT

00:17:04.423 --> 00:17:06.358
TAKES FIFTEEN YEARS TO GET DONE

00:17:06.425 --> 00:17:08.394
WE HAVE TO WORK TO UTILIZE THE

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.795
BEST CIENCE AN ADAPTIVELY

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:11.463
MANAGE TOWARDS RECOVER OF THESE

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.032
THESE SPECIES. AND THEN LASTLY

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.034
I'LL SAY YOU KNOW WE ARE REALLY

00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:17.970
PRIORITIZING THAT THE PROMISE

00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:20.472
OF COLLABORATION- I THINK WE'LL

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:21.774
HEAR A LOT OF PERSPECTIVE TODAY

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.975
ABOUT THEY WERE THE ROLE OF

00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:24.209
LITIGATION AND OBVIOUSLY

00:17:24.276 --> 00:17:26.178
LITIGATION HOUSE A ROLE IN

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:27.513
PROTECTING OUR FISHERIES. BUT

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:29.114
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IF WE CAN

00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:31.183
ULTIMATELY TRANSCEND LITIGATION

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.718
AND CREATE SOME TYPE OF

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:35.387
DURABLE- A SET OF RELATIONSHIPS

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:37.156
BETWEEN ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:39.124
THAT RESTORES FISHERIES AND

00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:41.560
MEETS OTHER NEEDS I THINK IT'S

00:17:41.627 --> 00:17:42.094
GOING TO BE BETTER FOR OUR

00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:44.663
ENVIRONMENT. SO WE'LL TALK

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.064
TODAY ABOUT WHEN I CALL TWO

00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:47.633
DISTINCT BUT OVER OVERLAPPING

00:17:47.699 --> 00:17:49.034
PROCESS SEES THAT ARE IMPACTING

00:17:49.101 --> 00:17:51.303
THE SALMON FISHERY. ON THE LEFT

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.573
YOU HAVE- WHAT I CALL THE BAY

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.308
DELTA PUMPING RULES OR THEY

00:17:56.375 --> 00:17:58.310
DON'T TO INFRASTRUCTURE RULES-

00:17:58.377 --> 00:17:59.812
THAT EXISTS TO PROTECT

00:17:59.878 --> 00:18:02.181
ENDANGERED SPECIES. SO A LOT OF

00:18:02.247 --> 00:18:02.781
PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THE

00:18:02.848 --> 00:18:04.049
BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS BUT I

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:05.050
ALWAYS LIKE TO TRY TO BREAK IT

00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:06.652
DOWN BECAUSE THAT'S CONFUSES

00:18:06.718 --> 00:18:08.187
PEOPLE SO THIS IS REALLY FROM

00:18:08.253 --> 00:18:09.421
MY PERSPECTIVE. THE RULES THAT

00:18:09.488 --> 00:18:10.722
GET PUT IN PLACE TO PROTECT

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:13.091
ENDANGERED SPECIES- AND THOSE

00:18:13.158 --> 00:18:14.293
ARE RULES THAT ARE REQUIRED

00:18:14.359 --> 00:18:15.594
BOTH BY OUR FEDERAL ENDANGERED

00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:17.029
SPECIES ACT AND OUR STATE

00:18:17.095 --> 00:18:18.430
ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT WHICH WE

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:20.732
KNOW OF AS SEASIDE. AND OUT OF

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:22.501
US HAS OF COURSE RESULTED IN AN

00:18:22.568 --> 00:18:24.603
UPDATED BIOLOGICAL OPINION.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:26.338
THAT UPDATE WAS DIRECTED BY

00:18:26.405 --> 00:18:29.908
PRESIDENT TRUMP- IN LATE TWENTY

00:18:29.975 --> 00:18:31.777
EIGHTEEN AND REYES. TURNS

00:18:31.844 --> 00:18:33.779
WITHIN OUR ADMINISTRATION

00:18:33.846 --> 00:18:34.580
CERTAINLY THE BROWN

00:18:34.646 --> 00:18:38.083
ADMINISTRATION AS WELL- BASED

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:39.785
ON THE WAY THAT THE PRESIDENT-

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:41.253
DIRECTED THAT UPDATE. I E. ON

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.088
IT LET US NOT TO TAKE AN

00:18:43.155 --> 00:18:44.456
EXTRAORDINARY ACTION WHICH IS

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:45.724
TO DECIDE THAT WE CAN NO LONGER

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:48.660
RELY ON THE FEDERAL. RULES THAT

00:18:48.727 --> 00:18:51.630
FEDERAL BIOLOGICAL OPINION. TO

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:53.098
COVER OUR STATE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:53.966
UNDER OUR STATE IN YOUR

00:18:54.032 --> 00:18:58.403
SPEECHES ACT. SO WE IN ESSENCE-

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.640
BEGAN DOWN A PARALLEL PATH-

00:19:01.707 --> 00:19:04.009
SCIENCE BASED INDEPENDENT

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:04.943
ASSESSMENT OF WHAT RIPPLES NEED

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.513
IT OUR E. W. R. INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:19:07.579 --> 00:19:10.148
ABIDE OR COMPLY WITH OUR EIGHT

00:19:10.215 --> 00:19:13.852
INJURES BECAUSE ACT SEASIDE. SO

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:14.419
MY OF THE DISCUSS. THAT YOU

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:15.153
HEARD ON THE FEDERAL. OPINION

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.622
IT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS

00:19:16.688 --> 00:19:18.390
HAS BEEN OUR CONTENTION THAT

00:19:18.457 --> 00:19:20.526
THEY ARE NOT PROTECTIVE ENOUGH.

00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:24.329
AND OF THAT- WE ARE. WE ARE

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:24.930
CREATING A SET OF RULES THAT

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:27.165
ARE DIFFERENT. AND WE IN THE

00:19:27.232 --> 00:19:28.834
FALL EXPLAINED THAT OUR

00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:30.736
PROBLEMS WERE. CLEAR ENOUGH

00:19:30.802 --> 00:19:32.704
WITH THAT THE- PROPOSED

00:19:32.771 --> 00:19:34.373
BIOLOGICAL OPINION THAT IF

00:19:34.439 --> 00:19:35.207
NEEDED WE WOULD FILE

00:19:35.274 --> 00:19:37.309
LITIGATION. WE HAD CONSTRUCTIVE

00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:38.911
DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR FEDERAL

00:19:38.977 --> 00:19:40.779
AGENCY PARTNERS IN RECENT

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:42.147
MONTHS BUT DIDN'T REACH

00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:43.882
RESOLUTION AND SO OBVIOUSLY BE

00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:45.851
FILED THAT- LITIGATION. THE

00:19:45.918 --> 00:19:47.519
SAME TIME CHALK IN THE

00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:48.520
DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE

00:19:48.587 --> 00:19:50.989
ARE FINALIZING A STATE PERMIT

00:19:51.056 --> 00:19:52.591
THIS INCIDENTAL TAKE PERMIT-

00:19:52.658 --> 00:19:55.294
THAT WILL. ENABLE ACCOMPLI

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.062
DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES

00:19:57.129 --> 00:19:58.730
INFRASTRUCTURES OPERATIONS

00:19:58.797 --> 00:20:00.365
COMPLIANCE WITH THE SUN SO

00:20:00.432 --> 00:20:02.768
THAT'S ONE. THE OTHER IS- OF

00:20:02.834 --> 00:20:03.468
COURSE PROTECTING THE

00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:06.738
BENEFICIAL USES OF. OUR OF THE

00:20:06.805 --> 00:20:08.640
SACRAMENTO RIVER SYSTEM IN ALL

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:09.474
OF ITS TRIBUTARY IS THE SAN

00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:11.777
JOAQUIN AND THE BAY DELTA OF

00:20:11.843 --> 00:20:12.678
COURSE WHICH THOSE TO RIVER

00:20:12.744 --> 00:20:15.647
SYSTEMS FLOW INTO. AND FRANKLY

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:20.085
THE STATE IS- DECADE VERDUGO UP

00:20:20.152 --> 00:20:21.787
TODAY IT PLAN TO ACTUALLY

00:20:21.853 --> 00:20:24.056
OPPORTUNITY BENEFICIAL USES IN

00:20:24.122 --> 00:20:26.191
THOSE RIVERS WHICH INCLUDES. ON

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:27.492
THE AND HEALTH OF THE RIVER BUT

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:29.695
I WE CAN. ACTIVITY RAY. WATER

00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:32.731
CA AT STORE. APPS UNDER THE

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:35.000
PORTER ACT NOW AS YOU KNOW I'VE

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:36.368
CHAIR IN THIS MEMBER THERE HAS.

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:38.870
A RACE. PROCESS WAS A NEW. A

00:20:38.937 --> 00:20:41.540
COUPLE FEW YEARS AGO- THAT

00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:43.875
WOULD REQUIRE ON IMPAIR FLOW IN

00:20:43.942 --> 00:20:51.483
THOSE THIS. ARE TO DO TELL. AND

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:52.884
WE HAVE FOCUSING OF ART GEN ON.

00:20:52.951 --> 00:20:54.853
I WANT TO BE AGREE. YEAH THE

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.488
BOMBING I'M SURE THERE STAND

00:20:56.555 --> 00:20:57.155
THEY WERE BE A LEGALLY ENFORCED

00:20:57.222 --> 00:20:59.224
SET OF. ARE TO IN THE HEALTH OF

00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:00.559
THOSE WATER WAYS AS A PLAN OF

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:02.027
IMPLEMENTATION- FOR THAT

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:04.229
REGULATORY ACTION. AND I WANT

00:21:04.296 --> 00:21:06.331
TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:06.965
WHAT THOSE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS

00:21:07.032 --> 00:21:09.801
ARE. SO SECRETARY BLUMENFELD

00:21:09.868 --> 00:21:12.037
FROM CALLIE PA AND I GUESS LAST

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:14.339
MONTH- LAID OUT WHAT WE THINK

00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:16.475
IS A LEGALLY AND SCIENTIFICALLY

00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:18.143
ADEQUATE FRAMEWORK FOR A

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.012
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT. AGAIN YOU

00:21:20.078 --> 00:21:22.114
GO BACK TO THAT A WAY TO

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.849
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THAT THAT

00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:27.919
STATE. LAW REQUIRED UPDATE OF-

00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:30.555
THE BAY DELTA PLAN. AND JUST

00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:33.025
THE BROAD BRUSH- ELEMENTS OF IT

00:21:33.091 --> 00:21:35.627
IS- EIGHT TO NINE HUNDRED

00:21:35.694 --> 00:21:36.695
THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF NEW WATER

00:21:36.762 --> 00:21:37.863
AND I SHOULD SAY THAT THAT IS

00:21:37.929 --> 00:21:40.165
NEW WATER THAT CANNOT BE ERODED

00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:42.267
BY LET'S SAY REDUCED WATER

00:21:42.334 --> 00:21:44.503
EXPORTS FROM THE BIOLOGICAL

00:21:44.569 --> 00:21:46.471
OPINION SO REALLY FOCUSED ON.

00:21:46.538 --> 00:21:47.973
AT ALMOST A MILLION ACRE FEET

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.341
OF NEW FLOWS COMPARED TO

00:21:49.408 --> 00:21:51.276
EXISTING CONDITIONS. ARE

00:21:51.343 --> 00:21:52.511
CALLING FOR THE RESTORATION OF

00:21:52.577 --> 00:21:54.346
OVER SIXTY THOUSAND ACRES OF

00:21:54.413 --> 00:21:56.615
HABITAT- THAT'S AS I UNDERSTAND

00:21:56.682 --> 00:21:58.350
IT ALMOST- TAKING THE YOLO

00:21:58.417 --> 00:22:00.252
BYPASS AND MULTIPLYING IT BY

00:22:00.318 --> 00:22:03.088
ABOUT- A ONE POINT TWO FIVE

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:04.122
THAT'S THE AMOUNT A HABITAT

00:22:04.189 --> 00:22:05.757
THAT WE'RE- TALKING ABOUT WOULD

00:22:05.824 --> 00:22:08.360
BE PART OF THIS- THAT WOULD AND

00:22:08.427 --> 00:22:09.828
THAT. THIS AGREEMENT WOULD

00:22:09.895 --> 00:22:11.463
GENERATE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:13.965
OF NEW INVESTMENT SHARED BY

00:22:14.032 --> 00:22:15.534
WATER USERS WHO FOR THE FIRST

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.868
TIME WITH A SOUTH THEMSELVES

00:22:16.935 --> 00:22:18.470
FOR THESE IMPROVEMENTS STATE

00:22:18.537 --> 00:22:19.237
GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL

00:22:19.304 --> 00:22:21.206
GOVERNMENT. AND THEN IMPORTANT

00:22:21.273 --> 00:22:22.708
AS I MENTIONED ACTUALLY A

00:22:22.774 --> 00:22:24.676
PORTION OF THAT GOING TO NEW

00:22:24.743 --> 00:22:26.244
COLLABORATIVE SCIENCE THAT

00:22:26.311 --> 00:22:29.014
WOULD BE GOVERNED BY- A

00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:30.048
TRANSPARENT COLLECTION OF

00:22:30.115 --> 00:22:31.850
ENTITIES MY VISION IS IT WOULD

00:22:31.917 --> 00:22:33.051
INCLUDE WATER USERS AND

00:22:33.118 --> 00:22:34.019
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION

00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:35.620
GROUPS AND FEDERAL AND STATE

00:22:35.687 --> 00:22:37.923
AGENCIES. TO ACTUALLY-

00:22:37.989 --> 00:22:39.524
DETERMINE WHAT SCIENCE IS

00:22:39.591 --> 00:22:41.226
NEEDED AND USE THAT ALONG WITH

00:22:41.293 --> 00:22:43.729
MONITORING TO ADAPTIVELY MANAGE

00:22:43.795 --> 00:22:45.564
THOSE NEW FLOWS AND THAT ADDED

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:48.266
HABITAT HABITAT. WE THINK THAT

00:22:48.333 --> 00:22:50.969
THIS ACTUALLY EXPANDS THE TOOLS

00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:52.571
THAT WE CAN USE TO BRING BACK

00:22:52.637 --> 00:22:53.638
SALMON AND OTHER FISH

00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:55.941
POPULATIONS SO YOU YOU SAW MY

00:22:56.007 --> 00:22:57.576
LIST OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND

00:22:57.642 --> 00:23:00.946
IN THE INCLUDED NOT JUST FLOW

00:23:01.012 --> 00:23:04.082
BUT HAVE TACK AND ADAPTIVE. AND

00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:06.051
SO THIS COMMENTARY AGREEMENT

00:23:06.118 --> 00:23:07.352
FRAMEWORK WE THINK ACTUALLY CAN

00:23:07.419 --> 00:23:08.653
BRING THOSE TOOLS IN A WAY THAT

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.322
THE SIMPLE WATER BOARD

00:23:10.388 --> 00:23:11.790
REGULATION BUT SIMPLY CONTROL

00:23:11.857 --> 00:23:14.693
THE LEVER ON FLOWS CANNOT.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:15.694
IMPORT WE BELIEVE THE BALLING

00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:17.028
AGREEMENT HAS PROMISED TO

00:23:17.095 --> 00:23:18.897
ACTUALLY COME INTO A FACT IN

00:23:18.964 --> 00:23:20.565
SHORT ORDER REALLY IN THE NEXT

00:23:20.632 --> 00:23:22.667
COUPLE OF YEARS. I THINK ONE OF

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:23.835
THE CHALLENGES OF THE

00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:25.737
REGULATORY PROCESS IS IT

00:23:25.804 --> 00:23:28.740
REQUIRES- ONE THAT THAT THAT

00:23:28.807 --> 00:23:30.008
REGULATORY PROCESS THE WATER

00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:32.177
BOARD- WILL. WILL WOULD HAVE TO

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:34.546
COMPLETE SECONDLY- ESSENTIALLY

00:23:34.613 --> 00:23:37.048
THE- AMENDMENT OF WATER RIGHTS

00:23:37.115 --> 00:23:38.350
IN THE ADJUDICATION OF WATER

00:23:38.416 --> 00:23:39.818
RIGHTS AND I AS I UNDERSTAND IT

00:23:39.885 --> 00:23:41.086
SEVERAL HUNDRED WATER RIGHTS.

00:23:41.153 --> 00:23:42.487
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY LITIGATION

00:23:42.554 --> 00:23:44.623
IN EVERY DIRECTION SO. WHAT

00:23:44.689 --> 00:23:46.958
I'VE HEARD IS THAT YOU KNOW THE

00:23:47.025 --> 00:23:49.227
MOST AMBITIOUS OP I ESTIMATE AS

00:23:49.294 --> 00:23:51.229
TO WHEN NEW WATER COULD COME

00:23:51.296 --> 00:23:52.564
IN- THE RIVER FROM THAT

00:23:52.631 --> 00:23:54.866
REGULATORY PROCESS WOULD BE. A

00:23:54.933 --> 00:23:57.102
SEVEN YEARS BUT I'VE ALSO HEARD

00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:58.236
TEN TO TWENTY YEARS SO FROM OUR

00:23:58.303 --> 00:23:59.538
PERSPECTIVE ONE KEY ADVANTAGE

00:23:59.604 --> 00:24:00.472
OF THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT

00:24:00.539 --> 00:24:02.374
FRAMEWORK BE ACTUALLY GETTING

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.743
THESE IMPROVEMENTS- IN BACK

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:06.645
INTO OUR RIVERS QUICKLY. IF WE

00:24:06.711 --> 00:24:08.180
LOOK AT THAT TRAJECTORY WHAT WE

00:24:08.246 --> 00:24:09.014
THAT DOUBLES THAT SALMON

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.082
DOUBLING GO BY TWENTY FIFTY. WE

00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:13.185
CAN'T FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE

00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:14.452
CAN'T WAIT FIFTEEN YEARS TO

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:15.720
MAKE AND VOEPEL IMPROVEMENTS

00:24:15.787 --> 00:24:18.690
BECAUSE WE I THINK WE ALL

00:24:18.757 --> 00:24:20.225
ASSUME WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:23.495
IF WE MAKE THOSE BARMA. THAT

00:24:23.562 --> 00:24:27.165
YEAH OKAY COME FLY. THE NOTE ON

00:24:27.232 --> 00:24:29.000
THIS IS THE A BREAKDOWN OF HOW

00:24:29.067 --> 00:24:29.568
THAT FIVE BILLION WOULD GET

00:24:29.634 --> 00:24:32.637
SPENT ALMOST ONE SEVEN ON HOW I

00:24:32.704 --> 00:24:34.472
SHOULD MENTION THAT WERE THAT

00:24:34.539 --> 00:24:35.540
BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE THIS

00:24:35.607 --> 00:24:36.508
PRESENTATION OF THOSE IN THE

00:24:36.575 --> 00:24:38.610
AUDIENCE. AND THEN LASTLY- DO I

00:24:38.677 --> 00:24:40.445
WANT TO MORE SLIDES- ONE IS

00:24:40.512 --> 00:24:41.646
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

00:24:41.713 --> 00:24:42.447
WHAT WE PUT OUT THERE IS A

00:24:42.514 --> 00:24:44.850
FRAMEWORK A PROPOSED FRAMEWORK-

00:24:44.916 --> 00:24:46.885
NEXT STEPS- IF WE GET THERE

00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:48.220
WOULD BE DEVELOPING THAT

00:24:48.286 --> 00:24:49.988
FRAMEWORK INTO A PROPOSED

00:24:50.055 --> 00:24:51.756
ENFORCEABLE AGREEMENT. SO

00:24:51.823 --> 00:24:54.125
ACTUALLY THE FINE PRINT- THAT

00:24:54.192 --> 00:24:55.627
WOULD THEN GETS SUBMITTED FOR

00:24:55.694 --> 00:24:57.162
SCIENTIFIC PEER REVIEW

00:24:57.229 --> 00:24:58.330
INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC PEER

00:24:58.396 --> 00:25:00.532
REVIEW OFFER COMMENT AND THEN

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:02.000
UNDERTAKEN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW

00:25:02.067 --> 00:25:04.035
PROCESS UNDERSEA C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;. AND&lt;/c&gt;</u>

00:25:04.102 --> 00:25:05.036
THEN HAVE THE WATER BOARD

00:25:05.103 --> 00:25:06.838
ACTUALLY CONSIDER IT AS A

00:25:06.905 --> 00:25:09.040
PROPOSAL OF IMPLEMENTATION AND

00:25:09.107 --> 00:25:09.741
THEY'D HAVE TO DEVELOP A

00:25:09.808 --> 00:25:11.209
SCIENTIFIC BASIS REPORT SO THE

00:25:11.276 --> 00:25:12.644
POINT IS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.

00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:14.913
IT IT WOULD IT WOULD UNDERGO

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.549
QUITE A LOT OF SCRUTINY. LASTLY

00:25:17.616 --> 00:25:18.116
YOU ASKED ABOUT THEIR MOLINO

00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:21.786
AFTER BAY. I'M IN A LOT OF THE-

00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:22.787
SALMON GROUPS HAVE MADE REALLY

00:25:22.854 --> 00:25:24.556
GOOD POINTS ABOUT LOOK LET'S

00:25:24.623 --> 00:25:25.757
LET'S LET'S PICK THE LOW

00:25:25.824 --> 00:25:26.858
HANGING FRUIT WHILE WE'RE

00:25:26.925 --> 00:25:28.159
NAVIGATING IS MORE COMPLICATED

00:25:28.226 --> 00:25:30.929
SUBJECTS AND THE FACT IS WATER

00:25:30.996 --> 00:25:31.663
THAT GETS THE THERMAL LIDO

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:34.332
INSTANCE THERE- ONE OF THE

00:25:34.399 --> 00:25:35.400
FEATHER RIVER- I'M TO THE

00:25:35.467 --> 00:25:37.402
EXTENT THAT IT REALLY REDUCES

00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:39.437
SUITABLE HABITAT. FOR SALMON A

00:25:39.504 --> 00:25:43.208
LOT OF THE RIVER JUST 1% TO

00:25:43.275 --> 00:25:44.643
THRIVE AND- YOU OUT QUESTION

00:25:44.709 --> 00:25:45.677
BOTH OF YOU ABOUT. WHY CAN'T WE

00:25:45.744 --> 00:25:48.179
ACTUAL MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS- I

00:25:48.246 --> 00:25:50.181
THINK THE BILL THE EXPLANATION

00:25:50.248 --> 00:25:51.950
HAD BEEN THAT WERE WAITING ON A

00:25:52.017 --> 00:25:53.018
FOR LICENSE WHAT I CAN TELL YOU

00:25:53.084 --> 00:25:55.887
TODAY IS WE AGREE WITH YOU. ON

00:25:55.954 --> 00:25:57.088
THE NEED TO ACTUALLY MOVE

00:25:57.155 --> 00:26:00.558
FORWARD ON THIS EFFORT AND-

00:26:00.625 --> 00:26:01.793
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.495
IS DONE ABROAD FEASIBILITY

00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:04.529
ASSESSMENT WHICH IS REALLY

00:26:04.596 --> 00:26:05.864
INITIAL WE THINK IT'S

00:26:05.931 --> 00:26:07.599
APPROPRIATE TO BEGIN THIS YEAR

00:26:07.666 --> 00:26:09.301
A MUCH MORE DETAILED-

00:26:09.367 --> 00:26:11.036
FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT OF THE

00:26:11.102 --> 00:26:12.304
DIFFERENT OPTIONS WHICH IS A

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.272
NECESSARY STEP ON THE CRITICAL

00:26:14.339 --> 00:26:15.073
PATH TO ACTUALLY GETTING THIS

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.342
DONE. I THINK MANY OF US AGREE

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:18.910
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE THE

00:26:18.977 --> 00:26:20.779
IMPROVEMENTS UNTIL THE FOR CREE

00:26:20.845 --> 00:26:21.813
LICENSING HAPPENS WHICH FRANKLY

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.248
IT'S BEEN. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE

00:26:23.315 --> 00:26:24.616
BEEN WAITING ON FOURTEEN YEARS

00:26:24.683 --> 00:26:26.184
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF THESE

00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:28.353
ABILITY- WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.187
DONE A LOT OF PLANNING THAT

00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:30.989
NEEDS TO BE DONE- THAT SHOULD

00:26:31.056 --> 00:26:32.490
BE DONE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH

00:26:32.557 --> 00:26:35.360
STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING SAM AND-

00:26:35.427 --> 00:26:37.462
GROUPS. AND SO I THINK WHAT I

00:26:37.529 --> 00:26:38.830
CAN SAY THAT WHICH IS NEW HERE

00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:42.133
TODAY IS THAT- THAT I CAN GIVE

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.635
YOU MY COMMITMENT TODAY THAT TO

00:26:43.702 --> 00:26:46.638
ACTUALLY START THAT WORK- WHICH

00:26:46.705 --> 00:26:47.172

LOOKING AT THAT FIVE BILLION

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.228
DOLLARS IT YOU CAN EXPAND YOU

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:11.963
HAD ONE CATEGORY OF WATER TYPE.

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.698
NEW WATER PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS

00:27:13.765 --> 00:27:15.800
WHAT ARE YOU ENVISIONING. IN

00:27:15.867 --> 00:27:17.569
THAT CATEGORY SO THERE ARE THE

00:27:17.635 --> 00:27:19.637
NOT THE BLUE- SEGMENT SO THERE

00:27:19.704 --> 00:27:21.172
ARE PROJECTS THAT WERE

00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:24.509
APPROVED- FOR- DEVELOPMENT

00:27:24.576 --> 00:27:26.244
UNDER PROPOSITION ONE WHICH WAS

00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:27.712
THE TWENTY FOURTEEN WATER BOND

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:29.647

CHARACTER EXPANSION- AND SO

00:27:34.719 --> 00:27:36.521
THIS WOULD ACTUALLY BE-

00:27:36.588 --> 00:27:39.124
REALIZING THOSE PROJECTS. ARE

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:42.327
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH- ADDITION

00:27:42.394 --> 00:27:44.062
TO OP SOME GROUND WITH

00:27:44.129 --> 00:27:46.064
GROUNDWATER BANKING PROJECTS

00:27:46.131 --> 00:27:47.899
THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. I'M WE

00:27:47.966 --> 00:27:49.234
ARE NOT IN THAT CATEGORY

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.837
PROPOSING A NEW- AS I DON'T

00:27:52.904 --> 00:27:53.772
THINK ANY NEW PRODUCTS THAT

00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:55.640
HAVE. ALREADY BEEN- CONSIDERED

00:27:55.707 --> 00:27:57.842
THE PROP ONE THING PROCESS.

00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:59.244
THIS IS GOOD THAT WAS MY

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:00.245
UNDERSTANDING I JUST WANTED TO

00:28:00.311 --> 00:28:02.380
MAKE A RECORD. AS ASSEMBLY.

00:28:02.447 --> 00:28:05.450
STONE I WOULD ALSO ADD IN THIS.

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:09.087
GRAPHIC TWO IMPORTANT POINTS

00:28:09.154 --> 00:28:12.157
FOLLOWING YEAH SO THE

00:28:12.223 --> 00:28:14.392
AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY IS.

00:28:14.459 --> 00:28:16.294
PUTTING A COMMITMENT ON THE

00:28:16.361 --> 00:28:18.396
TABLE HERE ABOUT DEMAND

00:28:18.463 --> 00:28:20.698
REDUCTION THAT'S SIGNIFICANT

00:28:20.765 --> 00:28:23.201
SECOND A LOT OF THE FINANCING

00:28:23.268 --> 00:28:25.370
UNDERNEATH THE CIRCLE IS A

00:28:25.437 --> 00:28:28.106
PROPOSED SELF TAX IT'S WATER

00:28:28.173 --> 00:28:29.374
AGENCIES IN DISTRICTS

00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:31.576
INCREASING THEIR OWN RATES FOR

00:28:31.643 --> 00:28:32.844
PURPOSES OF GENERATING THE

00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:34.479
REVENUE TO DO THIS WHOLE SALE

00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:36.548
COMPREHENSIVE ENDEAVOR THAT TOO

00:28:36.614 --> 00:28:38.416
IS ALSO PRECEDENT SETTING. AS I

00:28:38.483 --> 00:28:40.218
RECALL ABOUT 45% OF THAT BY

00:28:40.285 --> 00:28:41.753
BILLION AT LEAST IN THE

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:42.854
FRAMEWORK THAT THE SECRETARY

00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:46.191
BLUMENFELD I SUGGESTED- WOULD

00:28:46.257 --> 00:28:46.724
BE BORNE BY THAT THAT SELF

00:28:46.791 --> 00:28:49.961
ASSESSMENT. GOOD FOR THE TEXT

I WANNA FOCUS IN ON THE RELIEF

00:28:56.701 --> 00:28:58.970
I DIDN'T LIKE TO TRANSITION TO

00:28:59.037 --> 00:29:00.672
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS AND THEN

00:29:00.738 --> 00:29:01.239
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

00:29:01.306 --> 00:29:04.242
BIOLOGICAL PINION SO LOOK AT I

00:29:04.309 --> 00:29:06.344
KNOW YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT YOU

00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:08.580

HERE OF THESE THESE ARE YOUR

00:29:09.547 --> 00:29:12.717
WORDS. BUT IF THEY'RE STANDS

00:29:12.784 --> 00:29:14.786
HAS BEEN. THEY WANTED TO WAIT

00:29:14.853 --> 00:29:17.355
UNTIL FOR CAT ISSUED A LICENSE.

00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:18.890
TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD ON

00:29:18.957 --> 00:29:21.459
EVEN THAT MAJOR PLANNING

00:29:21.526 --> 00:29:25.330

A SHOW- FOR MANY YEARS IN THIS

00:29:33.571 --> 00:29:35.707
SPECIFIC AREA OF THE RIVER IN

00:29:35.773 --> 00:29:37.575
ITS KILLING TEN MINUTES WE KNOW

00:29:37.642 --> 00:29:38.276

WE'D LIKE TO BE A FOCUS IN ON

00:29:42.013 --> 00:29:43.047
IS THAT WHAT IS THAT TIMELINE

00:29:43.114 --> 00:29:45.350
RIGHT- FOR FEASIBILITY IN WHAT

00:29:45.416 --> 00:29:47.252
WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE. IS

00:29:47.318 --> 00:29:48.453

THAT JUST BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN

00:29:55.126 --> 00:29:58.329
A LONG TIME COMING RIGHT AND-

00:29:58.396 --> 00:29:59.864
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE

00:29:59.931 --> 00:30:00.932
TO GET THIS THING MOVING WITH

00:30:00.999 --> 00:30:02.200
THAT TIME LINE LOOKS LIKE AN OF

00:30:02.267 --> 00:30:03.468
HIM ANY COMMENTS ON IT YEAH I

00:30:03.535 --> 00:30:05.236
AFTER SPECIFIC QUESTION AND IT

SOUNDS LIKE IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT

00:30:06.771 --> 00:30:07.438
FOUR TO SIX MONTHS TO HAVE THE

00:30:07.505 --> 00:30:08.840
CONTRACT BE PUT IN PLACE BY THE

00:30:08.907 --> 00:30:11.509
W. R. TO ACTUALLY- FACILITATE

00:30:11.576 --> 00:30:12.877
THE STUDY. BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO

00:30:12.944 --> 00:30:14.078
HAVE A MORE DETAILED FOLLOW UP

00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:15.680

IN. IF WE TACKLE TALK ABOUT A

00:30:24.122 --> 00:30:25.990
LOW HANGING FRUIT PROJECT RIGHT

00:30:26.057 --> 00:30:27.358
I THAT IS GOING TO HAVE A

00:30:27.425 --> 00:30:28.593
DIRECT POSITIVE IMPACT TWO

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.428
SPECIES IS IN PERIL I THINK

00:30:30.495 --> 00:30:31.696
THIS IS ONE OF THEM YEAH AND

00:30:31.763 --> 00:30:32.764

OUR LICENSE THE BETTER AND I

00:30:35.266 --> 00:30:35.967
THINK THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF

00:30:36.034 --> 00:30:37.468
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS BUT ALSO

00:30:37.535 --> 00:30:39.070
MAJOR RECREATIONAL BENEFITS.

00:30:39.137 --> 00:30:39.938
FOR THE OROVILLE COMMUNITY

00:30:40.004 --> 00:30:41.105
THAT'S REALLY BEEN THROUGH THE

00:30:41.172 --> 00:30:42.073
RINGER OBVIOUSLY IN RECENT

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:46.144
YEARS SO ANY ANY- YOU KNOW- ANY

00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:48.112
COLLABORATION WE CAN HAVE ON ON

00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:49.781
MAKING THE CASE TO FOR TERROR

00:30:49.847 --> 00:30:50.315
ATTACKS BUT I THOUGHT WE

00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:52.684
HELPFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.152
REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WANT TO

00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:55.920
GO TO VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS AND-

00:30:55.987 --> 00:30:57.455
LOOK. AT I KNOW THIS IS

00:30:57.522 --> 00:30:59.157
SOMETHING THAT YOU. IN THE

00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:01.292
MINISTRATION OF A WORKING ON-

00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:05.697
AND- IT IS NEVER EASY. RIGHT

00:31:05.763 --> 00:31:07.498
BUT THERE'S CONCERN ESPECIALLY

00:31:07.565 --> 00:31:10.835
WITHIN- ENVIRONMENTAL AND SEVEN

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:11.502
COMMUNITY ABOUT THEIR

00:31:11.569 --> 00:31:13.538
VOLUNTARY. AND WHAT IS THE

00:31:13.605 --> 00:31:15.406
STICK TO BE OF THAT MOVE

00:31:15.473 --> 00:31:17.542
FORWARD WITH COMPLAINTS. AND IF

00:31:17.609 --> 00:31:19.444
WE DON'T SEE COMPLAINTS WHAT

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.312
HAPPENS. CAN YOU GO THROUGH

00:31:21.379 --> 00:31:22.347
THAT BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A

00:31:22.413 --> 00:31:23.948
LOT OF CONCERN IN REGARDS THAT

00:31:24.015 --> 00:31:26.050
SPECIFIC ISSUE YEAH SO LIKE I

00:31:26.117 --> 00:31:27.885
SAID I THINK THAT THE TITLE

00:31:27.952 --> 00:31:29.087
THAT'S NOW SORT OF TAKEN HOLD

00:31:29.153 --> 00:31:30.521
OF THESE SO CALLED VOLUNTARY

00:31:30.588 --> 00:31:31.155
AGREEMENTS IS A BIT OF A

00:31:31.222 --> 00:31:33.258
MISNOMER. BECAUSE THE THESE

00:31:33.324 --> 00:31:34.993
WOULD BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE

00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:36.160
AGREEMENTS AS I UNDERSTAND IT

00:31:36.227 --> 00:31:37.295
FOR THE WATER BOARD TO EVEN

00:31:37.362 --> 00:31:38.563
CONSIDER THIS A PATH OF

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:39.631
IMPLEMENTATION THEY WOULD

00:31:39.697 --> 00:31:40.965
ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE ENFORCEABLE

00:31:41.032 --> 00:31:42.734
SO THIS WOULD NOT BE. YOU KNOW

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.736
ASPIRATIONAL TARGETS THESE

00:31:44.802 --> 00:31:46.938
WOULD BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE

00:31:47.005 --> 00:31:47.739
THERE'S AN OPEN QUESTIONS

00:31:47.805 --> 00:31:50.074
ABOUT. I AND THIS IS WHERE WE

00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:50.908
REALLY THAT THIS THESE

00:31:50.975 --> 00:31:52.076
QUESTIONS COME IN IN IN

00:31:52.143 --> 00:31:53.411
FINALIZING WHAT AT WHAT AN

00:31:53.478 --> 00:31:54.979
AGREEMENT WOULD LOOK LIKE- ARE

00:31:55.046 --> 00:31:57.882
THERE OFF RAMPS FOR EXAMPLE IF-

00:31:57.949 --> 00:31:58.983
THERE AT THE BY A LARGE

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:00.285
BIOLOGICAL TARGETS THAT ARE

00:32:00.351 --> 00:32:01.185
DEVELOPED IN THE SPECIFIC

00:32:01.252 --> 00:32:05.790
AGREEMENT ARE NOT MET- I THINK

00:32:05.857 --> 00:32:06.391
THE WATER BOARD WOULD NOT HAVE

00:32:06.457 --> 00:32:08.059
MUCH IN. AT ALL IN VOLUNTARY

00:32:08.126 --> 00:32:09.961
THE PATHWAYS IMPLEMENTATION

00:32:10.028 --> 00:32:13.464
THERE WASN'T ACTUALLY- A TRUE-

00:32:13.531 --> 00:32:16.067
BINDING- SET OF COMMITMENTS FOR

00:32:16.134 --> 00:32:18.069
IMPLEMENTATION- SO FROM OUR

00:32:18.136 --> 00:32:20.138
PERSPECTIVE WHAT WE'D LIKE IS

00:32:20.204 --> 00:32:22.540
ON ANOTHER SPACE AND TIME TO

00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:24.776
ACTUALLY WORK ON AN ENFORCEABLE

00:32:24.842 --> 00:32:27.378
AGREEMENT THAT REALLY DETAILS.

00:32:27.445 --> 00:32:29.881
ON THE LEGAL ENFORCEABILITY

00:32:29.947 --> 00:32:30.915
TURN TO MAKE A CASE TO OUR

00:32:30.982 --> 00:32:31.983
STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THOSE

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:35.386
CONSERVATION GROUPS THAT THIS

00:32:35.453 --> 00:32:37.755
IS FAR FROM VOLUNTARY THIS IS

00:32:37.822 --> 00:32:40.191
ACTUALLY A- MANDATED. SO JUST

00:32:40.258 --> 00:32:40.892
JUST WALKING THROUGH THIS APP

00:32:40.958 --> 00:32:43.494
YEAH YOUR PATIENCE SO WORK WITH.

00:32:43.561 --> 00:32:45.663
AND OF CONTRACTS ALONG RIGHT

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:48.900
WITHIN DELTA YEP OR WHO ME

00:32:48.966 --> 00:32:50.968
VALUES. ON THAT WATER FLOW

00:32:51.035 --> 00:32:55.606
THROUGH THE DOW. YOU NEED ACTON.

00:32:55.673 --> 00:32:56.474
VERISIGN THAT WE DEDICATE A

00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:59.344
NUMBER OF ACRE FEET. IT GOAL I

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:02.447
I'M I'M I'M OVERSIMPLIFYING I.

00:33:02.513 --> 00:33:05.783
SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN- YOU DON'T

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:08.086
HAVE THOSE FOLKS STEP UP. AGAIN

00:33:08.152 --> 00:33:09.854
WORST CASE SCENARIO RIGHT YEAH

00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:11.489
THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY STEP UP

00:33:11.556 --> 00:33:13.524
TO BE ABLE TO. SIGN UP THE

00:33:13.591 --> 00:33:15.226
UNDER THIS PROGRAM IN SOMETHING

00:33:15.293 --> 00:33:17.195
SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID LITTLE

00:33:17.261 --> 00:33:18.396
BIT DIFFERENT BUT SOMEWHAT

00:33:18.463 --> 00:33:21.466
SIMILAR WE DID WITH THE- DRY

00:33:21.532 --> 00:33:22.867
CREEK BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS FROM

00:33:22.934 --> 00:33:24.769
MCCAIN RUSSIAN RIVER. BUT

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:27.572
CANDIDLY WE HAD CHALLENGES WITH

00:33:27.638 --> 00:33:29.807
LANDOWNERS STEPPING UP SO. WHAT

00:33:29.874 --> 00:33:31.509
HAPPENS THEN. YEAH I MEAN THERE

00:33:31.576 --> 00:33:33.144
WERE THERE THERE NEED TO BE

00:33:33.211 --> 00:33:34.245
CLEAR SANCTIONS THAT WOULD

00:33:34.312 --> 00:33:35.747
PROBABLY BE POTENTIALLY THE

00:33:35.813 --> 00:33:37.982
RIVERS AND- TO AN UNIMPAIRED

00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:40.418
FLOW SCENARIO. SO IT YOU KNOW

00:33:40.485 --> 00:33:42.120
JUST TO BE CLEAR WE'RE NOT ONLY

00:33:42.186 --> 00:33:43.388
TALKING ABOUT WATER CONTRACTORS

00:33:43.454 --> 00:33:44.722
THEY GET THEIR WATER FROM YOU

00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:46.524
KNOW FROM THOSE RIVERS WE'RE

00:33:46.591 --> 00:33:48.025
TALKING ABOUT WATER CONTRACTORS

00:33:48.092 --> 00:33:49.093
THEY GET THEIR WATER FROM THE

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.495
TRIBUTARIES OF THOSE RIVERS

00:33:50.561 --> 00:33:52.530
RIGHT FROM AS FAR NORTH AS AS

00:33:52.597 --> 00:33:53.664
THE SACRAMENTO MEANS DAM IN THE

00:33:53.731 --> 00:33:55.400
U. BAR. ALL THE WAY DOWN YOU

00:33:55.466 --> 00:33:56.567
KNOW NTO THE SAN JOAQUIN

00:33:56.634 --> 00:33:59.003
VALLEY- BUT IT'S VERY CLEAR

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.104
THAT IS NOT GOING TO WORK IF

00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:01.439
THEY'RE ACTUALLY THAT THERE

00:34:01.506 --> 00:34:02.940
AREN'T CLEAR SANCTIONS AND SO

00:34:03.007 --> 00:34:06.444
CHUCK I'M HAPPY IF YOU JUMP IN

00:34:06.511 --> 00:34:07.044
BUT- THE NOTION WOULD BE. THAT

00:34:07.111 --> 00:34:07.712
IF YOU BUY YOUR LEGALLY

00:34:07.779 --> 00:34:09.547
ENFORCEABLE AGREEMENT THEN YOU

00:34:09.614 --> 00:34:10.515
ARE BROUGHT INTO THE REGULATORY

00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:12.250
REGIME SO YOU YOU STILL NEED

00:34:12.316 --> 00:34:13.518
INDIVIDUALS WE HAD A STEP UP

00:34:13.584 --> 00:34:15.420
THOUGH DO BETTER PARTICIPATE.

00:34:15.486 --> 00:34:19.357
SO I THINK THERE THREE FILTERS

00:34:19.424 --> 00:34:20.958
TO YOUR QUESTION FIRST IS.

00:34:21.025 --> 00:34:22.994
UNLESS SUFFICIENT PEOPLE COME

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:26.030
TOGETHER AND EXECUTE. A LEGALLY

00:34:26.097 --> 00:34:28.399
ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT. WE WON'T

00:34:28.466 --> 00:34:30.201
GET THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS SO

00:34:30.268 --> 00:34:32.470
THE SECRETARY HAS DESCRIBED THE

00:34:32.537 --> 00:34:34.739
FRAMEWORK WE HAVE SOME HEAVY

00:34:34.806 --> 00:34:36.541
WORK AHEAD OF US TO TURN THAT

00:34:36.607 --> 00:34:38.142
INTO AN ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT

00:34:38.209 --> 00:34:39.877
THAT'S THE SECOND POINT.

00:34:39.944 --> 00:34:42.747
ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT IN MY MIND

00:34:42.814 --> 00:34:44.315
SHOULD HAVE REMEDIES AND

00:34:44.382 --> 00:34:46.584
CONSEQUENCES IF PEOPLE DON'T DO

00:34:46.651 --> 00:34:49.153
WHAT THEY PROMISED TO DO. AND

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:51.155
THEN THE THIRD FILTER WOULD BE.

00:34:51.222 --> 00:34:52.490
IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO

00:34:52.557 --> 00:34:54.959
COLLABORATE AND DO SOMETHING

00:34:55.026 --> 00:34:55.526
COMPREHENSIVE AND PRECEDENT

00:34:55.593 --> 00:34:57.795
SETTING. THEN THE REGULATORY

00:34:57.862 --> 00:35:00.565
PROCESS ARGUABLY SHOULD APPLY

00:35:00.631 --> 00:35:02.033
TO YOU WHICH IS THE UNIMPAIRED

00:35:02.099 --> 00:35:04.469
FLOW CALCULATION THE SECRETARY

00:35:04.535 --> 00:35:05.069
REFERENCED IN TIMELINE IS WHAT

00:35:05.136 --> 00:35:07.805
ON THAT. WELL THAT'S A GREAT

00:35:07.872 --> 00:35:09.240
QUESTION BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS

00:35:09.307 --> 00:35:10.174
LITIGATION THE BIOLOGICAL

00:35:10.241 --> 00:35:11.442
OPINIONS COMPLICATE THINGS

00:35:11.509 --> 00:35:13.711
YEAH- AND SO YOU KNOW BUT OUR

00:35:13.778 --> 00:35:16.113
FOCUS- LET'S SAY SETTING THAT

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.982
ASIDE FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES

00:35:18.049 --> 00:35:20.017
WAS TO REALLY MOVE TOWARDS- AND

00:35:20.084 --> 00:35:21.953
ENFORCEABLE AGREEMENT. TO BE

00:35:22.019 --> 00:35:22.753
PROPOSED TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.622
SCIENTIFIC REVIEW REALLY IN THE

00:35:24.689 --> 00:35:28.559
NEXT FOUR TO SIX MONTHS. OKAY

00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:31.629
ALL RIGHT. I AND I THINK THE

00:35:31.696 --> 00:35:33.631
LAST THING I'LL SAY NOT BELABOR

00:35:33.698 --> 00:35:34.966
THE POINT HERE IN BECAUSE I

00:35:35.032 --> 00:35:35.433
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:39.070
BIOLOGICAL PENNY AS WELL. IS

00:35:39.136 --> 00:35:41.072
UNLESS. BEING CANDID RIGHT AND

00:35:41.138 --> 00:35:42.206
AGAIN I'M JUST USING MY

00:35:42.273 --> 00:35:43.474
EXPERIENCE MUCH SMALLER PROJECT

00:35:43.541 --> 00:35:44.742
COMPLICATED MUCH SMALLER

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:46.077
PROJECT ON THE RUSSIAN SOME

00:35:46.143 --> 00:35:47.612
DIFFERENT DYNAMICS. UNLESS

00:35:47.678 --> 00:35:49.981
THERE'S DEADLINES GIVEN VERY

00:35:50.047 --> 00:35:50.615
GOOD INDIVIDUALS TO BE ABLE TO

00:35:50.681 --> 00:35:52.884
SIGN UP- AND IF YOU DON'T SIGN

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:54.886
UP THEN THERE IS GOING TO BE A

00:35:54.952 --> 00:35:58.890
STICK THAT'S COMING DOWN. FOLKS

00:35:58.956 --> 00:36:00.091
DON'T TYPICALLY MOVE WITHOUT A

00:36:00.157 --> 00:36:01.292
DEADLINE AND THAT'S WHY

00:36:01.359 --> 00:36:02.560
DISTRICT FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT

00:36:02.627 --> 00:36:03.895
LOOKS LIKE AND THEN HOW YOU

00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:06.030
BACK INTO THAT TOTAL GOAL OF

00:36:06.097 --> 00:36:07.632
WHAT YOU WERE JUST MENTIONING-

00:36:07.698 --> 00:36:10.535
IN REGARDS TO RESTORING SEE-

00:36:10.601 --> 00:36:11.035
SIX SIXTY THOUSAND ACRES

00:36:11.102 --> 00:36:13.170
HABITAT- EIGHT TO NINE OR TO

00:36:13.237 --> 00:36:15.239
THOUSAND. ACRE FEET INTO FLOWS

00:36:15.306 --> 00:36:16.641
BACK IN INTO THAT RIGHT SO

00:36:16.707 --> 00:36:19.176
THAT'S THAT'S I'M JUST TRYING

00:36:19.243 --> 00:36:19.744
TO GET MY HANDS ARE I MEAN I

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.078
WILL SAY THAT. FROM OUR

00:36:21.145 --> 00:36:22.880
PERSPECTIVE WATER USER COMING

00:36:22.947 --> 00:36:23.814
TO THE TABLE IN A VERY SERIOUS

00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:25.249
WAY AS CHUCK MENTIONED YOU KNOW

00:36:25.316 --> 00:36:27.985
THERE. THERE ARE- YOU KNOW.

00:36:28.052 --> 00:36:29.987
TALKING ABOUT- CREATING THEIR

00:36:30.054 --> 00:36:32.189
FIRST SELF ASSESSMENT OF OVER A

00:36:32.256 --> 00:36:33.357
BILLION DOLLARS TO FUND THESE

00:36:33.424 --> 00:36:35.927
IMPROVEMENTS. AND OBVIOUSLY NO

00:36:35.993 --> 00:36:37.194
ONE SIDE ON THE DOTTED LINE OF

00:36:37.261 --> 00:36:38.829
THAT BUT THERE ARE A LOT THAT

00:36:38.896 --> 00:36:40.665
ARE. HAVING BRACE THE FRAMEWORK

00:36:40.731 --> 00:36:42.099
FOR THAT. SO I ACTUALLY THINK

00:36:42.166 --> 00:36:43.868
THAT THEY DO THEY ARE AT THE

00:36:43.935 --> 00:36:44.869
TABLE IN PART BECAUSE OF

00:36:44.936 --> 00:36:46.070
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A REGULATORY

00:36:46.137 --> 00:36:48.105
PROCESS IF THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN.

00:36:48.172 --> 00:36:49.273
LAST THEY'LL SAY I DON'T WANT

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:50.441
TO HIDE THE BALL THOUGH THERE'S

00:36:50.508 --> 00:36:51.242
YOU KNOW REASONABLE PEOPLE

00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:53.277
DISAGREE WITH US AS IT RELATES

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:55.513
TO HOW MY WHAT THE FLOW NEEDED.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.548
VERSUS THOSE OTHER-

00:36:57.615 --> 00:36:58.883
IMPROVEMENTS WHICH GETS ITS

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:00.251
REALLY GOOD SEGUE BECAUSE IT

00:37:00.318 --> 00:37:01.686
LOOKED THIS BIOLOGICAL PAIN IS

00:37:01.752 --> 00:37:03.287
MOVING FORWARD IT COMPLETELY

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:04.388
SCREWS OVER TEMPERATURE

00:37:04.455 --> 00:37:06.991
PROTECTIONS EIGHT SCREWS OVER-

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:08.793
ELIMINATES FLOW PROTECTIONS

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:11.429
RIGHT- AND IS GONNA KILL

00:37:11.495 --> 00:37:15.099
SALMON. SO HOW IN AGAIN THIS IS

00:37:15.166 --> 00:37:16.801
NOT YOU RIGHT THIS OUT FEDERAL

00:37:16.867 --> 00:37:20.237
GOVERNMENT- I MEAN THIS MESSES

00:37:20.304 --> 00:37:22.974
IT ALL UP. YEAH IT LIKE I SAID

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.075
LIKE I SHOWED YOU THAT MEAN

00:37:24.141 --> 00:37:26.410
IT'S SEPARATE BUT OVERLAPPING

00:37:26.477 --> 00:37:27.812
AND SO YOU KNOW FROM OUR

00:37:27.878 --> 00:37:28.679
PERSPECTIVE WE'VE BEEN SO

00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:32.483
FOCUSED ON THIS- ON THIS

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:33.084
FIFTEEN YEAR AGREEMENT BECAUSE

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.186
WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS- GRAPH

00:37:35.252 --> 00:37:36.420
AND WE'RE THINKING HOW THE HECK

00:37:36.487 --> 00:37:37.655
ARE WE GONNA CHANGE THINGS THAT

00:37:37.722 --> 00:37:38.255
WE CAN IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS

00:37:38.322 --> 00:37:39.390
THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS. WE'RE

00:37:39.457 --> 00:37:40.358
GONNA BEAT WE'RE GONNA BE

00:37:40.424 --> 00:37:41.392
LOOKING AT THAT LINE GOING

00:37:41.459 --> 00:37:43.294
LOWER AND FRANKLY CAN'T GO MUCH

00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:44.562
LOWER FOR SOME OF THOSE SPECIES.

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:45.896
SO THAT'S WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON

00:37:45.963 --> 00:37:47.865
BUT- BUT- BUT SENATOR YOU'RE-

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:50.067
YOU'RE RIGHT THIS DOES THIS

00:37:50.134 --> 00:37:52.303
DOES MUCK UP THE WORKS. YEAH

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.572
IN- SO CAN YOU JUST WALK US

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:55.840
THROUGH AND I KNOW YOU CAN'T GO

00:37:55.906 --> 00:38:00.177
INTO GREAT DETAIL ON THIS BUT-

00:38:00.244 --> 00:38:02.313
WALK US THROUGH THE NEXT STEPS

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:03.981
SO OBVIOUSLY SHOT ACROSS THE

00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:06.584
BOW- CALIFORNIA THROUGH

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:07.585
ATTORNEY GENERAL WORKING

00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:08.886
CORNISH WITH YOUR OFFICE IN THE

00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:10.888
GOVERNOR. HAS MOVED FORWARD ON

00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:12.857
LITIGATION AND WHAT YOU WOULD

00:38:12.923 --> 00:38:13.824
HOPE TO BE ABLE TO SEE WITH THE

00:38:13.891 --> 00:38:18.295
GRAND VISION- OF THE PLAN THAT

00:38:18.362 --> 00:38:18.796
YOU'D LIKE TO BE TO SEE

00:38:18.863 --> 00:38:21.298
IMPLEMENTED. YEAH SO I WOULD

00:38:21.365 --> 00:38:24.602
SAY. YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE BEEN

00:38:24.669 --> 00:38:27.805
CLEAR THAT. THAT THESE CONCERNS

00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:29.373
WE HAVE ABOUT THE FEDERAL

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.307
BIOLOGICAL OPINION NEED TO BE

00:38:30.374 --> 00:38:32.109
RESOLVED AND WE'VE ALSO BEEN

00:38:32.176 --> 00:38:33.844
CLEAR THAT IT'S NOT OUR INTENT

00:38:33.911 --> 00:38:36.347
TO SIMPLY LITIGATE TO LITIGATE-

00:38:36.414 --> 00:38:39.216
THAT IF WE CAN ACTUALLY RESOLVE

00:38:39.283 --> 00:38:41.352
OR SETTLE OUR CONCERNS THAT WE

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:43.621
WOULD WELCOME THAT YEAH- AND

00:38:43.688 --> 00:38:45.990
THAT WOULD AT LEAST CLEAR- SOME

00:38:46.057 --> 00:38:47.224
SPACE FOR A COLLABORATIVE

00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:48.259
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE VOLUNTARY

00:38:48.325 --> 00:38:49.860
AGREEMENTS. I THINK THOSE

00:38:49.927 --> 00:38:52.196
CONVERSATIONS- THAT IT'S NOT

00:38:52.263 --> 00:38:54.065
YOU KNOW THE I'D SAY THAT'S

00:38:54.131 --> 00:38:54.965
THAT'S AN OPEN QUESTION AT THIS

00:38:55.032 --> 00:38:57.068
TIME WHETHER THOSE CONCERNS CAN

00:38:57.134 --> 00:38:59.370
BE RESOLVED. IN THE LAST PIECE

00:38:59.437 --> 00:39:03.474
HERE IN AGAIN I APPRECIATE THAT

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:04.041
THE SECRETARY DOING THE TO

00:39:04.108 --> 00:39:04.642
QUESTION PIECE IN THIS WILL DO

00:39:04.709 --> 00:39:06.143
BE A COMMA LOOK. AND I TO THE

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.044
DIRECTOR LOOK FOR THE

00:39:07.111 --> 00:39:08.379
DIRECTOR'S REPORT WHEN YOU'RE

00:39:08.446 --> 00:39:10.281
LOOKING AT SCIENCE BASED

00:39:10.347 --> 00:39:13.451
DECISIONS AND WHAT YOU LIKE ME

00:39:13.517 --> 00:39:15.953
TO IMPLEMENT. I'M THIS HAS

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.421
NOTHING TO DO WITH SIGNS IT

00:39:17.488 --> 00:39:20.191
HAPPENS AGREEMENTS. AND IT

00:39:20.257 --> 00:39:23.227
STINKS AS- THE SECRETARY OF

00:39:23.294 --> 00:39:25.663
NATURAL RESOURCES- ON THE

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:27.565
FEDERAL- INSIDE. THAT

00:39:27.631 --> 00:39:29.333
REPRESENTED MEANING THESE

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:29.934
INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU'RE TRYING

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.470
TO WORK WITH- I'M JUST TRYING

00:39:32.536 --> 00:39:33.838
TO FIGURE OUT. I UNDERSTAND

00:39:33.904 --> 00:39:35.406
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GO. ON

00:39:35.473 --> 00:39:37.408
THESE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS.

00:39:37.475 --> 00:39:38.843
TRYING TO BE ABLE TO GET

00:39:38.909 --> 00:39:43.013
MANDATED. ACTION A- A NEW

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:47.885
OUTLOOK AND NEW SCOPE. BUT THIS

00:39:47.952 --> 00:39:50.254
COMPLETELY SCREWS UP ANYTHING

00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:53.357
THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON. SENATOR

00:39:53.424 --> 00:39:56.127
HERE HERE'S WHAT I'D SAY. I

00:39:56.193 --> 00:39:57.294
THINK YOU KNOW THE SUB I PUT

00:39:57.361 --> 00:40:00.264
MYSELF THROUGH LAW SCHOOL AND

00:40:00.331 --> 00:40:02.700
TO DO FISHERIES RIVER ECOSYSTEM

00:40:02.767 --> 00:40:05.770
WORK. IN MY CAREER IN

00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:07.772
CALIFORNIA SO FAR I HAVE NOT

00:40:07.838 --> 00:40:10.407

00:40:19.984 --> 00:40:22.620
THAT DOUBLING TRAJECTORY. BUT

00:40:22.686 --> 00:40:25.356
RACES SUCH UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE

00:40:25.422 --> 00:40:25.956
OF THE STAKES IN THE DYNAMICS

00:40:26.023 --> 00:40:31.762

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:53.150
CONFLICT WHERE THE STATE WOULD

00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:13.964
AND DIGITIZED THOSE ARE

00:47:14.031 --> 00:47:15.465
EXAMPLES OF THE INVESTMENTS

00:47:15.532 --> 00:47:16.934
THAT'S WHY I STARTED WITH

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.502
BUDGET LET ME TURN TO THAT

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:22.005
OTHER QUICK TOUR CRAP. CRABBE

00:47:22.072 --> 00:47:24.374
HAS PROVOKED THIS DYNAMIC WITH

00:47:24.441 --> 00:47:26.777
MARINE MAMMALS. AS YOU KNOW

00:47:26.843 --> 00:47:27.844
LAST YEAR WE SPOKE ABOUT A

00:47:27.911 --> 00:47:29.646
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THAT HAVE

00:47:29.713 --> 00:47:30.314
BEEN REACHED BETWEEN THREE

STATE RULE WHICH WILL

00:47:41.858 --> 00:47:43.627
MEMORIALIZE A RISK US. AND

00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:45.495
MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. CALL THE

00:47:45.562 --> 00:47:48.465
RAMP. WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS

00:47:48.532 --> 00:47:50.901
WITH MANY LED BY THE LEADERSHIP

PERSON IN SAUSALITO NEXT WEEK

00:48:04.047 --> 00:48:05.115
WHICH IS NOW BEEN CONVERTED TO

00:48:05.182 --> 00:48:07.818
A TELECONFERENCE. WE WILL PUT

00:48:07.884 --> 00:48:10.120
OUT A THIRD INFORMAL DRAFT OF

00:48:10.187 --> 00:48:12.222
THE PROPOSED RULE. THE RULE

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:13.924
DESCRIBES THE STRUCTURE FOR

00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:15.425
DECISION MAKING THE INVOLVEMENT

00:48:15.492 --> 00:48:16.960
OF THE WORKING GROUP WHICH IS

00:48:17.027 --> 00:48:17.794
MULTI DISCIPLINARY

00:48:17.861 --> 00:48:20.530
STAKEHOLDERS. AND TELLS YOU THE

00:48:20.597 --> 00:48:22.733
CRITERIA USED TO MANAGE THIS

00:48:22.799 --> 00:48:24.201
INTERFACE BETWEEN MARINE

00:48:24.268 --> 00:48:27.037
MAMMALS AND THE CRAB FISHERY.

00:48:27.104 --> 00:48:30.407
THAT'S ALL CONSULTATION BEFORE

00:48:30.474 --> 00:48:31.875
WE MOVE TO AN ACTUAL FORMAL

00:48:31.942 --> 00:48:33.277
SUBMISSION TO THE OFFICE OF

00:48:33.343 --> 00:48:35.245
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. TO COMPLETE

00:48:35.312 --> 00:48:36.647
THE RULE MAKING WHICH WILL

00:48:36.713 --> 00:48:38.081
PROMPT YET ANOTHER ROUND OF

00:48:38.148 --> 00:48:39.783
PUBLIC FEEDBACK RESPONSE TO

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:42.386
COMMENTS WE ARE HECK BENT ON

00:48:42.452 --> 00:48:44.554
COMPLETING THIS RULE MAKING BY

00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:45.989
NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY. TO

00:48:46.056 --> 00:48:48.659
SETTLEMENT WE MADE AND IT'S

00:48:48.725 --> 00:48:50.360
ALSO THE PLATFORM IN WHICH WE

00:48:50.427 --> 00:48:51.061
WILL GO TO THE FEDERAL

00:48:51.128 --> 00:48:53.063
GOVERNMENT. AND I WOULD ARGUE

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:55.666
GET THE FIRST EVER. FEDERAL

00:48:55.732 --> 00:48:59.269
ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT PERMITS

00:48:59.336 --> 00:49:00.737
FOR A FISHERY THAT'S FIXED GEAR

00:49:00.804 --> 00:49:03.073
LIKE DUNGENESS CRAB RELATIVE TO

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:04.775
THE WRIST TO MARINE MAMMALS IN

00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:06.910
OCEAN SPACE THAT IS TO ALONE IS

00:49:06.977 --> 00:49:09.346
PRECEDENT SETTING. WE WON'T GET

00:49:09.413 --> 00:49:11.782
THERE. WITHOUT REALLY SOLID

00:49:11.848 --> 00:49:13.850
OPEN TRANSPARENT COORDINATION

00:49:13.917 --> 00:49:15.218
COMMUNICATION WITH THE TRAFFIC

00:49:15.285 --> 00:49:17.921
CRAB FISHERY SO WHAT I BELIEVE

00:49:17.988 --> 00:49:20.157
THE CRAB FISHERY WILL SEE

00:49:20.223 --> 00:49:21.191
BEFORE THEY GET TO THE MEETING

00:49:21.258 --> 00:49:24.227
NEXT WEEK IS A REVISED RULE

00:49:24.294 --> 00:49:25.696
KIND OF A STRAW PERSON THIRD

00:49:25.762 --> 00:49:27.798
VERSION. THAT REFLECTS A LOT OF

00:49:27.864 --> 00:49:29.700
THE INPUT. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:49:29.766 --> 00:49:31.401
A IN HIS ROLE FOR THE WORKING

00:49:31.468 --> 00:49:32.769
GROUP TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A

00:49:32.836 --> 00:49:33.704
GREATER EMPHASIS ON BASS

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:37.140
SCIENCE AND ADDITIONAL ASPECTS

00:49:37.207 --> 00:49:38.108
SO THAT'S COMING. ON A RISK

00:49:38.175 --> 00:49:40.243
ASSESSMENT FRONT YOU KNOW

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:41.244
BECAUSE IT IS SETTLEMENT

00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:42.612
ARRANGEMENT WE NOW HAVE

00:49:42.679 --> 00:49:44.815
CALENDAR MOMENTS. WHERE WE

00:49:44.881 --> 00:49:47.050
CONVENE THIS ADVISORY GROUP

00:49:47.117 --> 00:49:48.852
WHICH IS COMPLETELY COMPRISED

00:49:48.919 --> 00:49:50.554
OF MEMBERS OF THE FLEET THE

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:51.221
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY

00:49:51.288 --> 00:49:53.790
ACADEMICS. AND WE ASSESS THE

00:49:53.857 --> 00:49:56.126
SITUATION AT CERTAIN MOMENTS.

00:49:56.193 --> 00:49:57.194
TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE'S A

00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:00.430
HIGH MEDIUM OR LOW RISK.

00:50:00.497 --> 00:50:01.398
BETWEEN THE FISHERY AND

00:50:01.465 --> 00:50:04.034
ENTANGLEMENT AND THEN MAKE A

00:50:04.101 --> 00:50:06.370
MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATION. OR

00:50:06.436 --> 00:50:08.372
POTENTIALLY A DIRECTOR ACTION

00:50:08.438 --> 00:50:10.207
THAT GROUP MATT IN THE LAST

00:50:10.273 --> 00:50:12.542
COUPLE OF DAYS. THAT GROUPS

00:50:12.609 --> 00:50:14.544
ASSESSMENT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED

00:50:14.611 --> 00:50:17.848
TO ME THAT THE STATISTICS KIND

00:50:17.914 --> 00:50:19.349
OF THE INFORMATION THAT'S

00:50:19.416 --> 00:50:21.084
HAPPENING IN REAL TIME IS THIS

00:50:21.151 --> 00:50:22.886
WORKING GROUP CONCLUDES THE

00:50:22.953 --> 00:50:24.988
RISK OF ENTANGLEMENT IS LOW

00:50:25.055 --> 00:50:26.757
THAT MARINE LIFE CONCENTRATIONS

00:50:26.823 --> 00:50:29.126
RIGHT NOW IS LOW THAT ARE OCEAN

00:50:29.192 --> 00:50:31.228
ENFORCED CONDITIONS THE RISK OF

00:50:31.294 --> 00:50:33.029
THAT PRODUCING THE PROBLEM IS

00:50:33.096 --> 00:50:34.731
LOW AND THAT THE FISHING

00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:38.802
DYNAMICS RISK. IS LOW. SO THE

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:40.871
WORKING GROUP ALSO DID NOT

00:50:40.937 --> 00:50:43.073
RECOMMEND ANY MANAGEMENT ACTION.

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.008
AND THEY RECOMMEND WE KEEP THE

00:50:45.075 --> 00:50:48.845
SEASON GOING PAST APRIL ONE.

00:50:48.912 --> 00:50:49.312
I'M REQUIRED UNDER THE

00:50:49.379 --> 00:50:52.849
SETTLEMENT TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS

00:50:52.916 --> 00:50:53.984
BY MARCH FIFTEENTH WHICH

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:57.354
HAPPENS TO BE A SUNDAY. TO

00:50:57.421 --> 00:50:57.921
AVOID DOING THAT ON A SUNDAY

00:50:57.988 --> 00:50:59.656
WE'RE GONNA. MAKE OUR

00:50:59.723 --> 00:51:01.591
PRONOUNCEMENT TOMORROW THE

00:51:01.658 --> 00:51:03.593
TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.328
RECOMMENDATION AND WHETHER WE

00:51:05.395 --> 00:51:06.730
HAVE A MANAGEMENT ACTION WE

00:51:06.797 --> 00:51:08.899
WANT TO DO IT TOMORROW JUST

00:51:08.965 --> 00:51:09.566
CRIED GIVE CERTAINTY AND

00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:11.001
PLANNING STABILITY. THAT'S THAT

00:51:11.067 --> 00:51:17.107
pTHE FORECAST IS YOU KNOW WE RUN

00:51:17.174 --> 00:51:18.341
COMPLICATED MODELS THERE'S A

00:51:18.408 --> 00:51:20.677
FEDERAL COUNCIL THAT ENGAGES

00:51:20.744 --> 00:51:22.012
MANY IN THE ROOM ON DETERMINING

00:51:22.078 --> 00:51:25.315
THE UP COMING YEAR PREDICTIONS.

00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:28.652
SO THOSE PREDICTIONS ARE MIXED

00:51:28.718 --> 00:51:29.486
FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY OCEAN

00:51:29.553 --> 00:51:32.923
SALMON FISHERY BECAUSE- ON THE

00:51:32.989 --> 00:51:34.691
SACRAMENTO FALL RUN CHINOOK

00:51:34.758 --> 00:51:36.993
SIDE THINGS LOOK TO BE IN

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:39.463
DECENT SHAPE RIGHT NOW. AND DUE

00:51:39.529 --> 00:51:41.198
TO STRONG TURNS LAST SUMMER.

00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:42.666
THE PROTECTIONS WE WOULD

00:51:42.732 --> 00:51:44.267
OTHERWISE PUT IN PLACE FOR THE

00:51:44.334 --> 00:51:46.803
LEGALLY PROTECTED SACRAMENTO

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:49.039
WINTER RUN CHINOOK. WE DON'T

00:51:49.105 --> 00:51:50.874
EXPECT TO HAVE TO PUT SUCH

00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:52.409
STRANGER WAS PROTECTIONS INTO

00:51:52.476 --> 00:51:54.644
PLACE THAT WILL SUBSTANTIALLY

00:51:54.711 --> 00:51:56.146
REDUCE THE FISHING OPPORTUNITY

00:51:56.213 --> 00:51:58.515
IN THE OCEAN. SO IT LOOKS

00:51:58.582 --> 00:52:00.684
PRETTY GOOD IN THE SACRAMENTO.

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:01.318
PARTICULAR COMPARED TO A COUPLE

00:52:01.384 --> 00:52:03.520
YEARS AGO. BUT IF YOU TURN TO

00:52:03.587 --> 00:52:05.755
THE KLAMATH FRONT IT LOOKS NOT

00:52:05.822 --> 00:52:07.724
GOOD AT ALL SO THE CLAIM OF

00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:09.226
FALL RUN CHINOOK STOCK FORECAST

00:52:09.292 --> 00:52:12.329
IS NOT OPTIMISTIC. FULL STOP.

00:52:12.395 --> 00:52:13.797
AND THAT'S FALLING FROM A VERY

00:52:13.864 --> 00:52:16.500
POOR RETURN. THAT IS PROBABLY

00:52:16.566 --> 00:52:17.901
ONE OF THE LOWEST RETURNS WE'VE

00:52:17.968 --> 00:52:19.336
EVER HAD ON RECORD FOR THAT

00:52:19.402 --> 00:52:22.138
RIVER. AND IT IS BECAUSE THAT

00:52:22.205 --> 00:52:24.674
THAT WATERSHED IS IN A DROUGHT

00:52:24.741 --> 00:52:27.143
SCENARIO. AND IT TOO HAS A LOT

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:29.946
OF VERY SIMILAR WATER TENSIONS

00:52:30.013 --> 00:52:31.581
ABOUT WATER MANAGEMENT GOING ON

00:52:31.648 --> 00:52:34.484
BOTH IN A LEGAL ARENA. AND YOU

00:52:34.551 --> 00:52:35.519
KNOW ASSOCIATED WITH STOP FROM

00:52:35.585 --> 00:52:37.120
OREGON DOWN TO THE PACIFIC

00:52:37.187 --> 00:52:40.056
OCEAN. SO WE EXPECT OCEAN

00:52:40.123 --> 00:52:41.691
FISHING OPPORTUNITIES NORTH OF

00:52:41.758 --> 00:52:43.660
POINT ARENA TO BE PRETTY

00:52:43.727 --> 00:52:45.562
LIMITED IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:52:45.629 --> 00:52:46.830
BECAUSE OF THE DYNAMIC THAT'S

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:48.999
PLAYING OUT ON THE CLAIM. SO

00:52:49.065 --> 00:52:51.067
THAT'S A UPDATE ON- PROJECTIONS

00:52:51.134 --> 00:52:54.237
YOU ASKED ABOUT DISASTER. SO WE

00:52:54.304 --> 00:52:55.639
DID GET THE DIRECT PAYMENT OF

00:52:55.705 --> 00:52:57.574
CRAB DISASTER FUNDS OUT LAST

00:52:57.641 --> 00:53:00.043
YEAR. RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:01.945
AT THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS

00:53:02.012 --> 00:53:03.413
FOR THE RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.015
WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

00:53:05.081 --> 00:53:06.516
DISASTER RELIEF. WE'RE

00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:08.885
EVALUATING THEM WORKING WITH

00:53:08.952 --> 00:53:10.320
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:53:10.387 --> 00:53:12.322
HEALTH AND THE PACIFIC MARINE

00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:14.925
FISHERIES COMMISSION. TO FIGURE

00:53:14.991 --> 00:53:16.626
OUT WHAT PROJECTS SHOULD BE

00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:19.129
AWARDED TO IMPROVE THE ABILITY

00:53:19.195 --> 00:53:20.997
OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO DO TESTING

00:53:21.064 --> 00:53:23.833
CAPACITY THIS IS AROUND THE

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:25.569
DEMO A GAS AT ISSUE. WE DO NOT

00:53:25.635 --> 00:53:26.903
HAVE DATES FOR PRO GOVERNMENT

00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:29.005
YET FOR THE DISBURSEMENT OF

00:53:29.072 --> 00:53:30.807
EITHER THE SALMON OR THE

00:53:30.874 --> 00:53:33.143
SARDINE FUNDS TO US. BUT

00:53:33.209 --> 00:53:34.110
KNOWING WE NEED A QUICK

00:53:34.177 --> 00:53:36.279
TURNAROUND I WOULD SAY WE THINK

00:53:36.346 --> 00:53:37.714
WE'VE ALREADY FIGURED OUT THE

00:53:37.781 --> 00:53:40.884
SARDINE DISASTER SPEND PLAN SO

00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:42.285
ONCE IT GETS TO US WE HAVE A

00:53:42.352 --> 00:53:43.320
WAY TO TURN AROUND THE FUNDING

00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:45.121
PRETTY QUICKLY. AND ON THE

00:53:45.188 --> 00:53:47.757
SALMON DISASTER FRONT. WE'VE

00:53:47.824 --> 00:53:48.658
BEEN WORKING ON THIS

00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:50.527
EXPENDITURE PLAN WE'VE GOT

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:53.496
FEEDBACK FROM INDUSTRY- ALL OF

00:53:53.563 --> 00:53:54.731
THAT IS UNDER REVIEW BY US

00:53:54.798 --> 00:53:56.967
RIGHT NOW. WE ARE ON A TIGHT

00:53:57.033 --> 00:53:58.435
TIME LINE TO GET THE

00:53:58.501 --> 00:54:00.570
EXPENDITURE PLAN SET. AND I

00:54:00.637 --> 00:54:02.105
THINK IF YOU WERE ASKED NO OR

00:54:02.172 --> 00:54:04.007
DAVID GOLDBERGER ROB ROSS THEY

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:05.809
WOULD AGREE THAT. GIVEN

00:54:05.875 --> 00:54:07.177
PRIORITIES WE SHIFTED A TOUCH

00:54:07.243 --> 00:54:08.845
TO BE THINKING ABOUT SOME OF

00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:10.780
THE SALMON MANAGEMENT DECISIONS

00:54:10.847 --> 00:54:12.382
WE HAD TO MAKE IT RIGHT NOW.

00:54:12.449 --> 00:54:14.751
WITH THE DISASTER EXPENSE PLAN-

00:54:14.818 --> 00:54:15.552
OUT TO THE BACK BURNER. BUT NOW

00:54:15.619 --> 00:54:17.220
WE HAVE TO BRING IT. BRING IT

00:54:17.287 --> 00:54:19.689
BACK UP TO THE FRONT DOOR. SO

00:54:19.756 --> 00:54:23.159
THAT'S DISASTER. OKAY OPEN

00:54:23.226 --> 00:54:25.762
ACCESS GOOD STORY. IF YOU GO

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:29.366
BACK IN TIME. CALIFORNIA

00:54:29.432 --> 00:54:31.067
EXPERIENCED A DRAMATIC DECLINE

00:54:31.134 --> 00:54:33.803
OF ITS GROUND FISH TOOK IN LINE

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:35.505
ROCK FISH FISHERIES OFF OUR

DEPARTMENT SEVERELY RESTRICTED

00:54:42.712 --> 00:54:43.647
BOTH THE COMMERCIAL AND

00:54:43.713 --> 00:54:45.415
RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO

00:54:45.482 --> 00:54:49.319
FISH FOR THOSE FISH. IT WORKED.

00:54:49.386 --> 00:54:51.087
WE'RE NOW AT A PLACE WHERE JUST

00:54:51.154 --> 00:54:52.288
LAST WEEK AT THE FEDERAL

00:54:52.355 --> 00:54:54.524
COUNCIL OUR DEPARTMENT ALONG

00:54:54.591 --> 00:54:56.226
WITH MANY INDIVIDUALS IN THE

00:54:56.292 --> 00:54:58.928
ROOM WENT PUBLIC AND SAID WE

00:54:58.995 --> 00:54:59.663
THINK THIS GROUND FISH

00:54:59.729 --> 00:55:01.765
POPULATION HAS REBUILT AND

00:55:01.831 --> 00:55:03.967
REVITALIZE SUCH THAT WE OUGHT

00:55:04.034 --> 00:55:05.802
TO PUT AS A HIGH PRIORITY

00:55:05.869 --> 00:55:08.405
OPENING BACK UP THE FISHING

00:55:08.471 --> 00:55:09.472
OPPORTUNITY EXCEPT FOR TROLL

00:55:09.539 --> 00:55:12.042
EVERY OTHER THE- BALL. TO

00:55:12.108 --> 00:55:14.644
REBUILD A COMMERCIAL

00:55:14.711 --> 00:55:15.278
OPPORTUNITY THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN

00:55:15.345 --> 00:55:17.981
OFTEN. IT'S DUE TO THE HARD

00:55:18.048 --> 00:55:19.115
WORK OF THE MEN AND WOMEN

00:55:19.182 --> 00:55:21.685
BEHIND US WHO TOOK THE PAIN OF

00:55:21.751 --> 00:55:23.787
THE RESTRICTION HOPING ONE DAY

00:55:23.853 --> 00:55:25.522
WE WOULD GET BACK TO REBUILD

00:55:25.588 --> 00:55:28.558
POPULATION WE THINK WE HAVE AND

00:55:28.625 --> 00:55:30.427
THAT'S A GREAT STORY. LAST

00:55:30.493 --> 00:55:33.029
NIGHT ACTUALLY YESTERDAY A

00:55:33.096 --> 00:55:34.898
MEMBER OF THE CFA REMARKED TO

00:55:34.964 --> 00:55:37.200
ME THAT THERE COMMUNITY IN HALF

00:55:37.267 --> 00:55:40.336
MOON BAY CHANGED OVERNIGHT. ONE

00:55:40.403 --> 00:55:41.371
MOMENT THEY WERE ABLE TO CATCH

00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:43.106
GROUND FISH THE NEXT WE CUT HIM

00:55:43.173 --> 00:55:46.509
OFF. AND THEY LOST IT. THE IDEA

00:55:46.576 --> 00:55:49.212
OF GIVING THAT OPPORTUNITY BACK

00:55:49.279 --> 00:55:49.846
IS SOMETHING I DIDN'T THINK I'D

00:55:49.913 --> 00:55:53.917
SEE IN MY TENURE. COULD WHAT

00:55:53.983 --> 00:55:55.618
TAX IT'S KIND OF WAY IN THE

00:55:55.685 --> 00:55:56.486
WEEDS BUT IT WAS WHEN YOUR

00:55:56.553 --> 00:55:57.887
QUESTIONS AS YOU KNOW WHAT

00:55:57.954 --> 00:55:59.489
HAPPENS IS WE PUT TINY LITTLE

00:55:59.556 --> 00:56:01.624
MICROCHIPS IN SALMON. HATCHERY

00:56:01.691 --> 00:56:03.960
I'VE ACTUALLY DONE IT. FOR A

00:56:04.027 --> 00:56:06.429

THING. THAT'S WHAT THEY ASKED

00:56:10.333 --> 00:56:12.802
ME TO DO. AND IT'S INCREASE THE

00:56:12.869 --> 00:56:14.304
DATA SAID TO UNDERSTAND HOW

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:16.139
FISHER MOVING. AND IT FUELS THE

00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:17.407
INFORMATION INTO THOSE

00:56:17.474 --> 00:56:18.842
MODELING. EFFORTS I WAS

INTERNAL PROCESS AND PROTOCOL.

00:56:49.205 --> 00:56:51.040

DOESN'T GO OUT TO THE WATER

00:57:12.262 --> 00:57:13.530
BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOME

00:57:13.596 --> 00:57:15.965
SEMBLANCE OF HOPE LEFT RIGHT

00:57:16.032 --> 00:57:17.634
EVERY TIME YOU CAST THAT LINE

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:20.703
OR DROP DECK YEAR YOU HOPE YOU

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:22.205

I'M PRETTY MUCH A SALMON GEEK.

00:57:37.053 --> 00:57:39.289
I WOULD ARGUE THERE'S NO

00:57:39.355 --> 00:57:41.658
GREATER JOURNEY IN NATURE. THEN

00:57:41.724 --> 00:57:43.426
THOSE FISH THEY ARE BORN IN A

00:57:43.493 --> 00:57:46.062
RIVER. THEY SWIM OUT TO THE

00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:48.231
OCEAN YEARS LATER SOMETHING

00:57:48.298 --> 00:57:51.901
CLICKS. IN THEIR DNA AND THEY

00:57:51.968 --> 00:57:53.570
COME BACK TO THE VERY SAME

00:57:53.636 --> 00:57:56.039
PLACE. DESPONDENT START THE

00:57:56.105 --> 00:57:58.241
CIRCLE OVER AGAIN I CAN'T THINK

00:57:58.308 --> 00:58:00.210
OF ANY OTHER CREATURE THAT HAS

00:58:00.276 --> 00:58:02.779

CALIFORNIA AND WHILE THE

00:58:15.225 --> 00:58:17.227

00:59:52.822 --> 00:59:54.624
DIVE IF YOU KEEP IT THAT IN TWO

OUR SECOND PANEL AND I HAVE TWO

00:59:56.826 --> 00:59:59.495
MORE QUESTIONS ON WHAT TO

00:59:59.562 --> 01:00:00.863
EXPECT HERE IN SAUSALITO. THE

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:02.565
TELECONFERENCE I GUESS NOW YEAH

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:05.501
SO. HERE ARE SOME LIKELY

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:06.970
CHANGES I THINK THE COMMUNITY-

01:00:07.036 --> 01:00:08.538
SEE WHEN WE GET TO THE NEXT

01:00:08.604 --> 01:00:10.907
DRAW PERSON DRAFT. WE TOOK UP A

01:00:10.974 --> 01:00:13.643
BIG FOCUS ON WHETHER THE

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:15.178
SECTION OF THE RULE THAT HAS A

01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:17.213
LOT OF DEFINITIONS. WAS

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.781
CREATING AMBIGUITY AND WHETHER

01:00:18.848 --> 01:00:19.949
WE CAN TIGHTEN UP A LOT OF

01:00:20.016 --> 01:00:21.818
THAT. SO I THINK YOU COULD SEE

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:24.120
THAT. WE WANT TO PUT A GREATER

01:00:24.187 --> 01:00:25.555
EMPHASIS ON WHAT BEST AVAILABLE

01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:28.057
SCIENCE MEANS RELATIVE TO THIS

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:28.624
KIND OF STRUCTURED DECISION

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:30.827
MAKING. ONE OF THE MOST

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:32.061
IMPORTANT CRITICISMS OR

01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:33.696
FEEDBACK POINTS WAS WE DON'T

01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:35.365
SEE THE PROMINENT ROLE THE

01:00:35.431 --> 01:00:37.367
WORKING GROUP. YOU'VE RELIED ON

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:39.602
US DON'T CUT IS OUT SO I THINK

01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:41.804
YOU'LL SEE A BETTER DESCRIPTION

01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:43.506
OF THE ROLE OF THAT WORKING

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:44.140
GROUP IN THE STRUCTURE DECISION

01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:46.242
MAKING. WE'VE BEEN THINKING

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:47.477
ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE FINER

01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:49.512
SCALE MANAGEMENT TOOLS INSTEAD

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:52.015
OF. BEING STUCK SHOULD YOU

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:53.683
PURSUE A CLOSURE ACROSS THE

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:56.619
WHOLE COAST. WERE ACROSS THREE

01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:59.422
COUNTIES. IS THE FUTURE OF THIS

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:01.290
GOING TO BE MORE SURGICAL AND

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:02.258
PRECISION BASED WHERE YOU'RE

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:03.693
TRYING TO THINK ABOUT CLOSURE

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.462
HERE BUT GREATER OPENING THEIR

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:07.597
CONNECTED WITH YOU EAL TIME

01:01:07.663 --> 01:01:09.499
MANAGEMENT I THINK THAT WILL

01:01:09.565 --> 01:01:11.467
COME OUT IN THE RULE MORE. I

01:01:11.534 --> 01:01:13.236
THINK YOU'LL SEE.

01:01:13.302 --> 01:01:14.937
UNACKNOWLEDGED MEANT THAT PART

01:01:15.004 --> 01:01:16.572
OF THE CONTEXT OF THIS

01:01:16.639 --> 01:01:18.441
STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING. IS

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.376
TO UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMIC.

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:22.278
ASPECT OF CLOSURES AND

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:25.348
RESTRICTIONS. DUNGENESS CRAB IS

01:01:25.415 --> 01:01:30.019
PROBABLY MUCH LESS RELIABLE BUT

01:01:30.086 --> 01:01:32.822
IT STILL REMAINS ONE OF THE

01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:35.024
MOST LUCRATIVE FOR HARD MARK

01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:37.126
WORKING MEN AND WOMEN TO MAKE A

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:37.627
GO OF IT IN OUR COASTAL

01:01:37.693 --> 01:01:40.029
COMMUNITIES. MY UNDERSTANDING

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:42.465
IS IT IS SOMETHING THEY NEED

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:45.001
CERTAINTY AROUND. SALMON IS NOW

01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:47.403
BECOMING HIT OR MISS AND CAN'T

YOU CAN SEE THE NATURAL ORIGINS

01:16:32.287 --> 01:16:34.256
ALMOST WILL THEIR WAY OVER 40%

01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:35.924

01:17:05.687 --> 01:17:06.855
FEDERAL TRUMP BIOLOGICAL

01:17:06.922 --> 01:17:08.757

01:17:15.764 --> 01:17:16.264
THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER.

01:17:16.331 --> 01:17:17.132
THAT COULD COME OUT OF THE

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:18.633
CENTRAL VALLEY INTO THE

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.869
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS. BUT WHAT

01:17:20.936 --> 01:17:22.604
THEY MIGHT GIVE OUT WOULD BE

01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:24.373
TAKEN BY THE TRUMP BIOLOGICAL

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:26.375
OPINIONS. SO THE BIOPSY

01:17:26.441 --> 01:17:28.610

CROWFOOT JUST TOLD US ABOUT. SO

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:49.464
WE CAN GET THE BENEFITS UNLESS

01:17:49.531 --> 01:17:50.699

BASS LINES FOR THE DOUBLING

01:27:54.969 --> 01:27:56.404
GOALS. TWO TIMES NOTHING IS

01:27:56.471 --> 01:27:57.672
STILL NOTHING THESE NEED TO BE

01:27:57.739 --> 01:28:00.141
MEANINGFUL DOUBLE ANGLES- IN

01:28:00.208 --> 01:28:01.943
THIRTY YEARS. IS A LONG TIME TO

01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:03.544
ACHIEVE THEM PARTICULARLY IN

01:28:03.611 --> 01:28:05.213
LIGHT OF THE FLUCTUATING WATER

01:28:05.279 --> 01:28:07.115
CONDITIONS. AND THE HYDROLOGY

01:28:07.181 --> 01:28:09.450
THAT COULD IF THESE BIOLOGICAL

01:28:09.517 --> 01:28:12.020
OPINIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED-

01:28:12.086 --> 01:28:12.820
RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT

01:28:12.887 --> 01:28:14.722
CURTAILMENT. MAYBE VOLUNTARY

01:28:14.789 --> 01:28:16.324
AGREEMENTS OF THE PATH FOR IT I

01:28:16.391 --> 01:28:17.525
CAN'T SEE HOW THAT HAPPENS WITH

01:28:17.592 --> 01:28:18.860
OF THE STATE WATER BOARD BEING

01:28:18.926 --> 01:28:20.361
PREPARED. TO ORDER UP

01:28:20.428 --> 01:28:22.063
UNIMPAIRED FLOW REQUIREMENTS BY

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:23.431
DATE CERTAIN THESE NEGOTIATIONS

01:28:23.498 --> 01:28:26.401
FAIL. FOUR TO SIX MONTHS IS A

01:28:26.467 --> 01:28:27.802
IS AN AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE TO

01:28:27.869 --> 01:28:29.404
PUT TOGETHER CONTRACT THAT WILL

01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:30.638
BE CLOSE TO TWO YEARS AFTER THE

01:28:30.705 --> 01:28:31.873
STATE WATER BOARD ACTED LAST

01:28:31.939 --> 01:28:33.441
DECEMBER OR DECEMBER TWENTY

01:28:33.508 --> 01:28:36.044
EIGHTEEN. ANDWITH ALL DUE

01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:39.147
RESPECT TO THE RAPID PACE THAT

01:28:39.213 --> 01:28:40.915
THE NEWSROOM MINISTRATIONS

01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:42.116
PROPOSED FOR THIS PROCESS. WE

01:28:42.183 --> 01:28:43.885
NEED ACTION NOW AND WE NEED

01:28:43.951 --> 01:28:46.320
DATE CERTAIN FOR FALL BACKS WE

01:28:46.387 --> 01:28:47.088
NEED TO GO BACK TO THE STATE

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:48.456
WATER BOARD PROCESS. IF

01:28:48.523 --> 01:28:50.358
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS DON'T WORK

01:28:50.425 --> 01:28:52.326
AND I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR-

01:28:52.393 --> 01:28:54.128
STRICT ENFORCEABLE TIMELINE FOR

01:28:54.195 --> 01:28:55.463
THAT ACTION. OUR FISHING

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:56.998
INDUSTRY SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD A

01:28:57.065 --> 01:28:58.399
REPEAT OF THE MISTAKES OF THE

01:28:58.466 --> 01:29:01.536
PAST WE NEED ACTION- AND I

01:29:01.602 --> 01:29:03.504
THANK YOU. ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR

01:29:03.571 --> 01:29:05.106
SUPPORT AS WE MOVE THIS PROCESS

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:06.908
FORWARD. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS

01:29:06.974 --> 01:29:08.409
DROP AND I AM- WOULD LIKE TO BE

01:29:08.476 --> 01:29:10.678
ABLE TO ASK OUR PANEL STRUCTURE

01:29:10.745 --> 01:29:12.280
ANY ITEMS THAT YOU HAVE. I

01:29:12.346 --> 01:29:16.451
THINK. I LOOK. WE HAVE HEARD

01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:18.519
FROM SOME CENTRAL VALLEY

01:29:18.586 --> 01:29:23.191
FARMERS AT THAT THIS WOULD NOT.

01:29:23.257 --> 01:29:24.859
THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE

01:29:24.926 --> 01:29:26.894
ALARMIST THEIR WORDS NOT MINE.

01:29:26.961 --> 01:29:28.763
THAT THERE'S NO WAY THIS WOULD

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:31.733
CAUSE AN EXTINCTION OF IT. I IN

01:29:31.799 --> 01:29:32.667
TWO MINUTES IF YOU ALL DON'T

01:29:32.734 --> 01:29:36.537
MIND- WALK US THROUGH. HOW THAT

01:29:36.604 --> 01:29:39.107
COULD HAPPEN IF THIS BIOLOGICAL

01:29:39.173 --> 01:29:41.409
PLAN OPINION OR IMPLEMENTED.

01:29:41.476 --> 01:29:48.883
FIRST. UP LET ME START OFF-

01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:51.152
THEY SHASTA COLD WATER

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:53.654
MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT THAT BOTH

01:29:53.721 --> 01:29:56.324
MY COLLEAGUES REFERRED TO. WHAT

01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:58.226
WE'RE ON A PATH TO THIS YEAR

01:29:58.292 --> 01:29:59.961
RIGHT NOW GIVEN THE DRY

01:30:00.027 --> 01:30:02.029
CONDITIONS WE'VE EXPERIENCED

01:30:02.096 --> 01:30:04.999
IS- HAS BEEN MODELED TO LOOK

01:30:05.066 --> 01:30:07.235
SOMETHING LIKE WHAT WE

01:30:07.301 --> 01:30:08.669
EXPERIENCED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN

01:30:08.736 --> 01:30:10.338
AND TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN MORE

01:30:10.404 --> 01:30:13.474
THAN 95% OF THE SALMON.

01:30:13.541 --> 01:30:15.143
SPAWNING AND REARING BELOW

01:30:15.209 --> 01:30:18.846
SHASTA DAM WERE KILLED BY WATER

01:30:18.913 --> 01:30:20.681
TEMPERATURES THAT WERE TOO HOT

01:30:20.748 --> 01:30:25.386
90% MORE THAN 95% OF THOSE EGGS

01:30:25.453 --> 01:30:29.457
AND FRY. UNDER THIS BIOLOGICAL

01:30:29.524 --> 01:30:30.992
OPINION EVEN THOUGH

01:30:31.058 --> 01:30:33.027
RECLAMATIONS MODELING SHOWS

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:34.962
THAT IS UNLIKELY EVENT AND IT'S

01:30:35.029 --> 01:30:37.131
GOING TO GET WORSE BECAUSE THAT

01:30:37.198 --> 01:30:37.665
WAS BEFORE WE HAD TO DRIVE

01:30:37.732 --> 01:30:40.268
FEBRUARY. THAT'S ALLOWED THEY

01:30:40.334 --> 01:30:42.236
CAN GO AHEAD AND OPERATE THAT

01:30:42.303 --> 01:30:46.240
WAY AND WIPE OUT A 100% OF THE

01:30:46.307 --> 01:30:47.775
SALMON SPAWNING IN REARING

01:30:47.842 --> 01:30:50.344
BELOW SHASTA. THEY CAN DO THAT

01:30:50.411 --> 01:30:52.313
FOR THREE YEARS IN A ROW. THIS

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:55.383
IS A THREE YEAR LIVED SPECIES-

01:30:55.449 --> 01:30:56.751
YOU WEBER MOB THREE YEARS IN A

01:30:56.818 --> 01:30:58.753
ROW AND WINTER RUN CHINOOK OR

01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:00.688
GOD WHO ONLY SURVIVE BELOW

01:31:00.755 --> 01:31:03.558
SHASTA DAM AND FOREIGN SPRING

01:31:03.624 --> 01:31:05.393
RUN ARE ALSO FOUND THERE AND-

01:31:05.459 --> 01:31:07.895
WILL NOT BE. IMPROVED BY THAT

01:31:07.962 --> 01:31:09.997
SCENARIO. NO I APPRECIATE

01:31:10.064 --> 01:31:11.966
DIRECTS MISSION THANK YOU SO

01:31:12.033 --> 01:31:12.567
LET'S THIS DO ANOTHER LAYER ON

01:31:12.633 --> 01:31:18.005
THAT THERE'S. DEVASTATING

01:31:18.072 --> 01:31:21.342
NOMINAL IMPACT. LET'S TALK

01:31:21.409 --> 01:31:23.578
ABOUT THE ISSUE OF JOBS HOW

01:31:23.644 --> 01:31:25.580
MANY JOBS ARE RELYING ON A

01:31:25.646 --> 01:31:29.116
HEALTHY SALMON FISHERY AND IT'S

01:31:29.183 --> 01:31:29.984
A TOP TIER FISHERY IN THE STATE

01:31:30.051 --> 01:31:31.986
AS WELL SO IF YOU ALL DON'T

01:31:32.053 --> 01:31:34.822
MIND. LET'S JUMP INTO WHAT THE

01:31:34.889 --> 01:31:38.092
ECONOMIC IMPACTS TO LOOK LIKE

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:40.595
FOR I THINK TWENTY THREE

01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:41.195
THOUSAND FOLKS ARE DEPENDENT A

01:31:41.262 --> 01:31:42.330
HEALTHY SEVEN FISHERIES TO WALK

01:31:42.396 --> 01:31:43.931
US THROUGH THAT SHEILA TRIED AS

01:31:43.998 --> 01:31:46.000
WELL OBVIOUSLY SO KENYA CAN

01:31:46.067 --> 01:31:47.735
TALK TO US ABOUT THAT ALSO A

01:31:47.802 --> 01:31:51.339
COUPLE THINGS IN ACOSTA NOAH.

01:31:51.405 --> 01:31:52.773
AT TEN THOUSAND FEET WE'RE

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.175
LOOKING AT TWENTY THREE

01:31:54.242 --> 01:31:55.209
THOUSAND JOBS RELATED TO THE

01:31:55.276 --> 01:31:56.777
SAME INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA

01:31:56.844 --> 01:31:58.579
ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION

01:31:58.646 --> 01:32:00.681
DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN

01:32:00.748 --> 01:32:01.249
A NORMAL YEAR WHEN WE GET A

01:32:01.315 --> 01:32:03.351
DECENT SEASON- A LOT OF THOSE

01:32:03.417 --> 01:32:05.653
JOBS. SIR IN THE COMMERCIAL

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:07.221
SECTOR SUMMER AROUND THE SPORTS

01:32:07.288 --> 01:32:08.589
SIDE AND THAT TAKES INTO

01:32:08.656 --> 01:32:10.691
ACCOUNT MULTIPLIERS TO LIKE THE

01:32:10.758 --> 01:32:12.360
HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS THE

01:32:12.426 --> 01:32:14.262
LAUNCH RAMPS THE MARINAS. THE

01:32:14.328 --> 01:32:16.097
TACKLE SHOPS AT CENTRO THAT ALL

01:32:16.163 --> 01:32:18.366
GET IN ON IT I'M- NOAH CAN

01:32:18.432 --> 01:32:20.134
EXPOUND ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE

01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:21.569
I JUST WANT TO SAY. A LOT OF

01:32:21.636 --> 01:32:22.837
TIMES IT'S NOT OBVIOUS ARE

01:32:22.904 --> 01:32:24.672
VISIBLE BUTOVER ON THE SPORTS

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:25.673
SIDE THERE'S A TREMENDOUS

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.375
AMOUNT OF MONEY BEING SPENT. I

01:32:27.441 --> 01:32:29.010
THINK OF THE NATIONAL MARINE

01:32:29.076 --> 01:32:30.211
FISHERIES SERVICE RECORD SHOWS

01:32:30.278 --> 01:32:32.847
SOMETHING LIKE A HUNDRED TWO

01:32:32.914 --> 01:32:33.481
HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS PER

01:32:33.547 --> 01:32:35.449
PERSON PER DAY THAT THEY GO

01:32:35.516 --> 01:32:37.051
SALMON FISHING. BOATS IN THE

01:32:37.118 --> 01:32:39.320
OCEAN AND INLAND SIDE NURSED

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:41.155
TENS OF THOUSANDS ACTUALLY

01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:42.023
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

01:32:42.089 --> 01:32:44.926
WHO CHASE SALMON. FOR SPORT

01:32:44.992 --> 01:32:47.528
CELL THERE'S A HUGE ECONOMY

01:32:47.595 --> 01:32:49.196
JUST AROUND THE SPORT FISHERY

01:32:49.263 --> 01:32:53.100
NO. JOHN IT IS. CENTER OF OUR

01:32:53.167 --> 01:32:57.571
IN A GOOD YEAR IN THIS DECADE

01:32:57.638 --> 01:32:59.373
YOU CAN EXPECT TO SEE AROUND

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:03.177
PERHAPS. NINE HUNDRED TO NINE

01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:03.678
HUNDRED FIFTY COMMERCIAL

01:33:03.744 --> 01:33:05.913
FISHERMEN INDIVIDUAL BOATS

01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:07.682
OPERATING IN THE SALMON FISHERY

01:33:07.748 --> 01:33:11.385
AND THAT'S THAT'S IN THE BEST

01:33:11.452 --> 01:33:11.986
YEAR THAT WE'VE SEEN IN QUITE

01:33:12.053 --> 01:33:14.355
SOME TIME. ON THE OTHER END IN

01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:16.023
THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES WE

01:33:16.090 --> 01:33:18.225
COULD EXPECT TO SEE FOUR

01:33:18.292 --> 01:33:19.427
THOUSAND FIVE THOUSAND VOTES SO

01:33:19.493 --> 01:33:21.495
IT UNDER BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES

01:33:21.562 --> 01:33:23.864
WE'VE LOST 75% OF THE FLEETS

01:33:23.931 --> 01:33:27.601
CAPACITY- IN REALITY WE HAVE

01:33:27.668 --> 01:33:29.537
PERHAPS A HUNDRED BOATS THAT

01:33:29.603 --> 01:33:31.072
ARE COMPRISING THE MAJORITY OF

01:33:31.138 --> 01:33:32.606
THAT FISHING EFFORT IN A GIVEN

01:33:32.673 --> 01:33:35.509
SEVEN SEASON- AND CERTAINLY THE

01:33:35.576 --> 01:33:37.311
CONSTRUCTION OF THAT EFFORT IS

01:33:37.378 --> 01:33:40.314
NOT- IS. TRACKING THE

01:33:40.381 --> 01:33:44.518
HISTORICAL TRENDS WE ARE LOSING

01:33:44.585 --> 01:33:46.654
FISHERMEN LEFT AND RIGHT TO

01:33:46.721 --> 01:33:50.224
EITHER JUST EXASPERATION OR- TO

01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:51.158
SEEKING OTHER FISHING

01:33:51.225 --> 01:33:52.293
OPPORTUNITIES THIS IS A

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.462
PORTFOLIO FISHERY SALMON IS THE

01:33:54.528 --> 01:33:55.629
TRADITIONAL SUMMERTIME FISHERY

01:33:55.696 --> 01:33:57.298
AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT IT'S

01:33:57.365 --> 01:33:59.166
THERE IS THE THIRD LEG OF THE

01:33:59.233 --> 01:34:00.668
TRADITIONAL SMALL SCALE FISHING

01:34:00.735 --> 01:34:03.604
STOOL SALMON. CRAB ROCKFISH

01:34:03.671 --> 01:34:06.107
WITHOUT ONE OF THOSE LEGS THE

01:34:06.173 --> 01:34:07.875
WHOLE INDUSTRY FALLS APART IF I

01:34:07.942 --> 01:34:09.810
CAN JUST PUT A FINE POINT BOTH

01:34:09.877 --> 01:34:11.479
OF YOU HAVE COASTAL DISTRICTS.

01:34:11.545 --> 01:34:14.248
BOTH OF YOU HAVE COASTAL

01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:16.217
COMMUNITIES. I'M A NATIVE

01:34:16.283 --> 01:34:17.985
CALIFORNIAN I THINK YOU BOTH

01:34:18.052 --> 01:34:18.786
ARE TUNED AND YOU'VE WATCH

01:34:18.853 --> 01:34:20.254
WHAT'S HAPPENED WE HAVE A

01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:21.722
DIVERSE ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA

01:34:21.789 --> 01:34:22.623
IN A LOT OF THE COASTAL

01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:24.458
COMMITTEE. OUT COMMUNITIES WILL

01:34:24.525 --> 01:34:26.227
PERSIST BUT NOT ALL OF THEM.

01:34:26.293 --> 01:34:27.595
YOU'VE GOT SOME IN YOUR

01:34:27.661 --> 01:34:29.797
DISTRICT AND I BELIEVE YOU TO

01:34:29.864 --> 01:34:31.766
ASSEMBLYMAN SO WE'RE NOT JUST

01:34:31.832 --> 01:34:34.135
TALKING JOBS IT'S ALSO- COASTAL

01:34:34.201 --> 01:34:35.636
COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS BELIEVE

01:34:35.703 --> 01:34:36.604
IT OR NOT SOME OF THE INLAND

01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:38.572
COMMUNITIES THAT RELY ON SALMON

01:34:38.639 --> 01:34:39.707
FISHING EVERY FALL. ON THIS

01:34:39.774 --> 01:34:40.875
WITNESS THINGS HAVE REALLY GOOD

01:34:40.941 --> 01:34:42.510
POINT YOU TAKE A LOOK AT RULE

01:34:42.576 --> 01:34:44.412
COASTAL COMMUNITIES IN THE LIFE

01:34:44.478 --> 01:34:46.614
FLIGHT IS FISHING INDUSTRY- AND

01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:49.083
WE ARE COMPLETELY HOST-

01:34:49.150 --> 01:34:50.418
ESPECIALLY OF A DOUBLE WHAMMY

01:34:50.484 --> 01:34:52.620
OF A CHALLENGING CRAB SEASON.

01:34:52.686 --> 01:34:53.954
AND IN NON EXISTENT SALMON

01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:57.091
SEASON ADVANCE IS DEVASTATING

01:34:57.158 --> 01:34:58.292
FOR THE LOCAL ECONOMY. I'D LIKE

01:34:58.359 --> 01:35:01.028
TO TURN TO MISS POOL- QUICKLY.

01:35:01.095 --> 01:35:02.997
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT SALMON

01:35:03.064 --> 01:35:04.932
BUT THIS IS ALSO ABOUT. LARGER

01:35:04.999 --> 01:35:08.669
MAMMALS IN WALES. RIGHT SO TALK

01:35:08.736 --> 01:35:10.004
TO US ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT WE

01:35:10.071 --> 01:35:13.174
SEE. ON THAT FOOD STOCK- OUT IN

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.176
THE OCEAN IS WHAT IS THAT THIS

01:35:15.242 --> 01:35:15.943
IS GOING TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:18.712
IMPACT. FOR THAT FOOD STOCK FOR

01:35:18.779 --> 01:35:21.115
THESE BEAUTIFUL MAMMALS THAT

01:35:21.182 --> 01:35:23.250
ARE FEEDING ON SAME AS WELL.

01:35:23.317 --> 01:35:26.854
WELL THAT'S RIGHT THE- THE TWO

01:35:26.921 --> 01:35:27.354
THOUSAND NINE BIOLOGICAL

01:35:27.421 --> 01:35:29.323
OPINION THAT THIS NEW ONE IS

01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:31.459
REPLACING. WASN'T JEOPARDY

01:35:31.525 --> 01:35:33.194
OPINION FOR ORCAS AS WELL

01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:36.530
BECAUSE- SALMON ARE ORCAS MAIN

01:35:36.597 --> 01:35:39.033
FOOD SUPPLY AND SO WHEN THE

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:41.368
SALMON STOCKS ARE PHÃN NOT

01:35:41.435 --> 01:35:42.303
ONLY ARE THESE GUYS AND ALL OF

01:35:42.369 --> 01:35:45.005
THEIR- CONSTITUENTS. BADLY

01:35:45.072 --> 01:35:50.478
IMPACTED BUT- ALL OF THE- LARGE

01:35:50.544 --> 01:35:52.780
MAMMALS BOTH IN THE OCEAN AND

01:35:52.847 --> 01:35:55.416
UPSTREAM THAT RELY ON THEM FOR

01:35:55.483 --> 01:35:57.551
FOOD FOR REPLENISHING THE SOIL

01:35:57.618 --> 01:35:59.820
FOR. FERTILIZING REDWOOD

01:35:59.887 --> 01:36:03.491
FORESTS ALL OF THOSE- BENEFITS

01:36:03.557 --> 01:36:05.726
ARE GONE. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:36:05.793 --> 01:36:09.630
ALSO TALKING HERE ABOUT- THE

01:36:09.697 --> 01:36:11.198
BIOLOGICAL OPINION FOR DELTA

01:36:11.265 --> 01:36:12.900
SMELT WHICH YOU KNOW IS

01:36:12.967 --> 01:36:16.237
FREQUENTLY CHARACTERIZED AS-

01:36:16.303 --> 01:36:17.771
THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE FOR

01:36:17.838 --> 01:36:20.641
THE DELTA SO IN THAT SENSE THE

01:36:20.708 --> 01:36:22.743
DECLINE OF THE SPECIES FROM YOU

01:36:22.810 --> 01:36:24.645
KNOW NOT TOO MANY DECADES AGO

01:36:24.712 --> 01:36:26.280
IS THE MOST ABUNDANT IN THE

01:36:26.347 --> 01:36:29.416
DELTA ONLY LIVES HERE. TOO NOW

01:36:29.483 --> 01:36:32.653
FUNCTIONALLY EXTINCT BY MANY-

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:34.855
MANY BIOLOGISTS ASSESSMENT THAT

01:36:34.922 --> 01:36:36.423
MEANS WE'RE DOING SOME REALLY

01:36:36.490 --> 01:36:38.192
BAD IN THE DELTA THIS THIS

01:36:38.259 --> 01:36:40.161
SPECIES IS TELLING US HOW THAT

01:36:40.227 --> 01:36:42.163
ECOSYSTEM IS FARING IN ITS NOT

01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:44.398
DOING WELL I THINK THAT IT IS

01:36:44.465 --> 01:36:46.867
IF YOU'RE NOT INVOLVED IN THE

01:36:46.934 --> 01:36:48.669
FISHING COMMUNITY HAVE NO IDEA.

01:36:48.736 --> 01:36:50.971
THAT THE STOCK IN THE

01:36:51.038 --> 01:36:54.175
SACRAMENTO. IMPACTS WESTERN

01:36:54.241 --> 01:36:55.276
STATES IN ALL THE WAY UP TO

01:36:55.342 --> 01:36:58.112
CANADA SO- IF YOU DON'T MIND.

01:36:58.179 --> 01:37:00.381
AT QUICKLY TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:37:00.447 --> 01:37:01.615
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THIS ISN'T

01:37:01.682 --> 01:37:04.118
JUST IMPACT IN OUR NECK OF THE

01:37:04.185 --> 01:37:09.290
WOODS. OUR THAT THAT'S CORRECT.

01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:10.891
I THINK NO I CAN TALK MORE

01:37:10.958 --> 01:37:14.995
ABOUT HIS- MEMBERS OF PC FFA UP

01:37:15.062 --> 01:37:16.830
IN OREGON BUT ARE CALIFORNIA

01:37:16.897 --> 01:37:18.699
THE SACRAMENTO BORN CHINOOK

01:37:18.766 --> 01:37:20.801
SALMON STOCKS SUPPORT THE

01:37:20.868 --> 01:37:22.903
FISHERY UP AND DOWN THE WEST

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:25.573
COAST IT'S NOT JUST CALIFORNIA-

01:37:25.639 --> 01:37:28.842
SO FOR AGAIN SOME IN WASHINGTON

01:37:28.909 --> 01:37:32.346
AND BEYOND- OBVIOUSLY WE ARE

01:37:32.413 --> 01:37:34.815
EXPERIENCING THREATS TO SALMON

01:37:34.882 --> 01:37:37.017
POPULATIONS ALL THE WAY UP TO

01:37:37.084 --> 01:37:39.753
ALASKA FROM DIFFERENT. TRUMP

01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:41.622
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSALS AND

01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:45.259
OTHER THINGS SO. THIS IS REALLY

01:37:45.326 --> 01:37:49.263
A- IT'S NOT JUST IN A THREAT TO

UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA ARE UNIQUE

01:37:51.131 --> 01:37:52.533
TO OUR CHINOOK SALMON RUNS IT'S

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:55.970
A IT'S AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO

01:37:56.036 --> 01:37:57.571

SUPPORT. WITH THE FREE TRIAL

01:38:00.608 --> 01:38:03.244
SO- ABOUT 60% OF THE KING

01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:05.579
SALMON CAUGHT IN THE OCEAN OFF

01:38:05.646 --> 01:38:07.147
OF THE OREGON COAST ALL THE WAY

01:38:07.214 --> 01:38:09.216
UP TO KEEP FALCON WHICH IS

01:38:09.283 --> 01:38:10.484
ALMOST UP TO THE BORDER WITH

01:38:10.551 --> 01:38:12.052
WASHINGTON COME OUT OF THE

FISH FROM CALIFORNIA THAT ARE

01:38:15.889 --> 01:38:17.925
RELIED ON BY OREGONIANS ON THE

01:38:17.992 --> 01:38:19.159
PRIOR QUESTION ABOUT THE

01:38:19.226 --> 01:38:21.295
NUTRITION VALUE- WE'RE ONE OF

01:38:21.362 --> 01:38:22.963
THE RARE PLACES IN THE WHOLE

01:44:05.372 --> 01:44:07.507
FORWARD IN WALES THIS WAS

01:44:07.574 --> 01:44:08.976
COINCIDENT BUT OF A- BECAUSE

01:44:09.042 --> 01:44:09.610
IT'S BEEN SHIPPED THAT WE

01:44:09.676 --> 01:44:10.944
SHOULD THE- DID IN PREVIOUS.

01:44:11.011 --> 01:44:12.879
YEARS WE PROPOSE THAT THESE

01:44:12.946 --> 01:44:13.513
BECAUSE CHANGES COMBINED WITH

RECOVER WELL POPULATIONS

01:44:15.415 --> 01:44:18.352
CONTRIBUTED TO THE EXACERBATING

OF ENTITLEMENTS ROUTE THE

01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:21.355
MARINE HEATWAVE WAS THE PROBLEM

01:44:21.421 --> 01:44:23.523
WITH THE- CELL IT WAS TO

01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:24.191

SHE THAT OCCURRED IN R. COASTAL

01:44:25.525 --> 01:44:27.361
WATERS. WE PRESENT A

01:44:27.427 --> 01:44:28.996
RETROACTIVE ASSESSMENT OF

01:44:29.062 --> 01:44:31.365
ENTANGLEMENT. TO DEMONSTRATE

01:44:31.431 --> 01:44:33.133
THAT COOPERATION OF TEACHERS

RESOURCE MANAGERS AND BUYING

01:44:35.102 --> 01:44:37.804
COULD COME TO THE MINUTE IF YOU

01:44:37.871 --> 01:44:39.706
THINK. AND TANK THE REST BY THE-

01:44:39.773 --> 01:44:41.041
BECAUSE RAY. FISHER APPROACHES

01:44:41.108 --> 01:44:43.210
TWICE A THRIVING FOR COMMUNITY.

01:44:43.276 --> 01:44:44.645
I BELIEVE THAT THIS THIS IS THE

01:44:44.711 --> 01:44:48.649
BEST. AVAILABLE SCIENCE THAT

01:44:48.715 --> 01:44:49.716
WE'RE ALL LOOKING FOR ENSURING

01:44:49.783 --> 01:44:50.450
FOR TO APPLY. AND WE TO BE A

01:44:50.517 --> 01:44:51.885
DOT ABOUT. IN OTHER WORDS A RE

01:44:51.952 --> 01:44:53.687
LIEU. HOW MARINE HEATWAVE

01:44:53.754 --> 01:44:55.055
ALTERS THE STRUCTURE IN AREAS

01:44:55.122 --> 01:44:56.456
OF UP WELLING HABITAT OFF

01:44:56.523 --> 01:44:58.558
CALIFORNIA. COASTAL UPWELLING

01:44:58.625 --> 01:45:00.027
IS THE PROCESS BY WIND BLOWING

01:45:00.093 --> 01:45:01.728
ALONG THE COAST AND THEY DRIVE

01:45:01.795 --> 01:45:03.330
THIS DEEP COLD NUTRIENT RICH

01:45:03.397 --> 01:45:04.765
WATER TO RISE TO THE SURFACE

01:45:04.831 --> 01:45:06.833
THIS NORMALLY. RESULTS IN AN

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:09.603
EXPANSION OF THIS COOL OF RICH

01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:11.371
FOOD WEB THAT EXPANDS A HUNDRED

01:45:11.438 --> 01:45:13.173
KILOMETERS OFF THE COAST THAT'S

01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:15.442
THE TYPICAL CASE WHAT. DURING

01:45:15.509 --> 01:45:17.210
THE MARINE HEATWAVE WE WEREN'T

01:45:17.277 --> 01:45:19.146
ABLE TO WEEK TWO. PERFECTLY

01:45:19.212 --> 01:45:20.280
DESCRIBED THAT BECAUSE OUR

01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:21.915
NORMAL INDICES ARE JUST LOOKING

01:45:21.982 --> 01:45:23.684
AT THE MAGNITUDE OF UP WELLING

01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:24.918
IT'S NOT LOOKING AT THE SPECIAL

01:45:24.985 --> 01:45:26.386
FOOT PRINT OF THE UP WELLING

01:45:26.453 --> 01:45:28.155
HABITAT. SO DURING THE MARINE

01:45:28.221 --> 01:45:30.524
HE WAY WHAT WE NOTICE WAS THIS

01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:32.959
EXTREME COMPRESSION OF THAT

01:45:33.026 --> 01:45:34.561
COOL UP WORLD WATER HABITAT

01:45:34.628 --> 01:45:36.496
ALONG THE COAST JUST TO A

01:45:36.563 --> 01:45:39.866
NARROW BAND. AND THAT CAUSES-

01:45:39.933 --> 01:45:42.536
AN ECOSYSTEM SHIFT AND THE

01:45:42.602 --> 01:45:43.470
ESSENTIALLY THE OFFSHORE

01:45:43.537 --> 01:45:45.706
ORGANISMS ARE MOVING IN SHORE

01:45:45.772 --> 01:45:47.040
AND THE CLUSTER IN THE ONLY

01:45:47.107 --> 01:45:48.642
AVAILABLE COOL HABITAT SO YOU

01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:49.976
CAN THINK OF THIS AS A REFUGE

01:45:50.043 --> 01:45:51.845
IF YOU WILL. THE CALIFORNIA

01:45:51.912 --> 01:45:53.447
CRAB FISHERY WHICH TYPICALLY

01:45:53.513 --> 01:45:55.916
OPENS IN MID NOVEMBER AND BY

01:45:55.982 --> 01:45:58.118
LATE WINTER AND EARLY SPRING

01:45:58.185 --> 01:46:00.687
THE CATCH IS A REALLY LOW AND

01:46:00.754 --> 01:46:01.221
MOST OF THE GEAR HAS BEEN

01:46:01.288 --> 01:46:03.523
REMOVED FROM THE WATER SO WE

01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:05.926
REALLY HAVEN'T HAD. PROBLEMS IN

01:46:05.992 --> 01:46:07.194
THE PAST WITH RICK WAVES

01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:09.296
BECAUSE IT I'M SHIFTING USING

01:46:09.362 --> 01:46:12.632
THIS. TWO THOUSAND IN DUE TO

01:46:12.699 --> 01:46:13.734
THE DELAY OPENING THE CRAB

01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:14.534
FISHING SEE. ALL THE FISHING

01:46:14.601 --> 01:46:15.268
GEAR WHEN OUR RIGHT DOOR THE

01:46:15.335 --> 01:46:17.204
PEAK OR- OF WALES SO THIS MADE

01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:18.972
WORSE WHILE SHORT INCREASE IN

01:46:19.039 --> 01:46:20.941
ENGLAND SIT. WITH UNFORTUNATE

01:46:21.007 --> 01:46:23.677
HI CAUGHT TENSION MAN MADE

01:46:23.744 --> 01:46:25.212
DISEASE AND THE- TWO THOUSAND.

01:46:25.278 --> 01:46:26.913
IS NOT THE HOLES. IN FACT WE

01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:31.084
START SEEING. IN THE SPIKE

01:46:31.151 --> 01:46:34.121
AROUND EGGMAN LATER THE FOR

01:46:34.187 --> 01:46:37.624
TEAM. WELL BEFORE THE BLADE

01:46:37.691 --> 01:46:43.130
CRABS NOT. STAND AS THE RESULTS

01:46:43.196 --> 01:46:45.899
OF HOW THE FEEDING IF YOU'RE-

01:46:45.966 --> 01:46:51.705
WAY. THE. THROUGHOUT THE

01:46:51.772 --> 01:46:52.873
ENSURING OFF YOUR HABITS

01:46:52.939 --> 01:46:54.007
COLLECTIVELY MOVED IN SHORT

01:46:54.074 --> 01:46:55.142
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE FOOD

01:46:55.208 --> 01:46:57.010
WAS THE CRUEL THAT THE NORMALLY

01:46:57.077 --> 01:46:57.911
FEED ON THE OFF SHORE

01:46:57.978 --> 01:46:59.946
ENVIRONMENTS IS MUCH MORE

01:47:00.013 --> 01:47:01.615
WIDELY DISBURSING THE OUTER

01:47:01.681 --> 01:47:03.083
SHELF BRAKES TO A QUESTION YES

01:47:03.150 --> 01:47:04.618
TO TALK RIGHT I'M INTERRUPTING

01:47:04.684 --> 01:47:05.485
I REALLY DO SPACE ONE MAKE SURE

01:47:05.552 --> 01:47:10.457
I'M- E. MADE A COMMENT. SO IT

01:47:10.524 --> 01:47:13.093
EVERYONE. ALL SPECIE. CROWDED

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:15.262
UP CLOSER TO SHORE. RIGHT OUT

01:47:15.328 --> 01:47:16.429
WHERE TRAPS ARE ALSO BEING

01:47:16.496 --> 01:47:21.535
DRAFT. IT'S NOT ABOUT HAVING

01:47:21.601 --> 01:47:23.203
COOL WATER CLOSE TO THE SHORE

01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:24.538
EIGHT DIGIT WALKING THROUGH

01:47:24.604 --> 01:47:26.506
THAT ONE MORE TIME. I'M GOING

01:47:26.573 --> 01:47:27.574
TO GET TO IT AGAIN IN A MOMENT

01:47:27.641 --> 01:47:29.442
OF THIS HOME BYE BYE BIRDIE

01:47:29.509 --> 01:47:32.879
HAPPY TO DO THIS OF IT. BUT SO

01:47:32.946 --> 01:47:36.416
WHEN WE HAVE A HE WAY YEP THIS

01:47:36.483 --> 01:47:38.318
ON SHORE WHICH IS. YOU KNOW

01:47:38.385 --> 01:47:39.786
JUST FROM AFTER GLOBAL WAR

01:47:39.853 --> 01:47:41.188
THAT'S BECAUSE THE NOR PACIFIC

01:47:41.254 --> 01:47:44.191
WARM THAT WE WAR FROM THE OFF

01:47:44.257 --> 01:47:47.127
SHORE ENVIRONMENT ENCROACHES ON

01:47:47.194 --> 01:47:48.094
THE BOUNDARY OF OUR UP WELL

01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:50.564
WATER WHICH IS IDENTIFIED

01:47:50.630 --> 01:47:51.865
PARTICULAR ISOTHERM JUST

01:47:51.932 --> 01:47:54.100
DEGREES CELSIUS SO THAT WARM

01:47:54.167 --> 01:47:56.970
WATER SHRINKS HELPS PUSH THAT

01:47:57.037 --> 01:47:59.105
COLD RECLINING AGAINST THE

01:47:59.172 --> 01:48:00.240
COAST THAT'S THE NARROW BAND

01:48:00.307 --> 01:48:01.341
THAT'S THE ACTUAL MECHANISM. OF

01:48:01.408 --> 01:48:08.381
HABITAT COMPOUND. THIRTEEN

01:48:08.448 --> 01:48:10.717
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE. WELL WILL

01:48:10.784 --> 01:48:12.085
ACTUALLY HAPPEN IN THE TO THE

01:48:12.152 --> 01:48:13.553
THIS AND MOM THIS IN REAL NOW

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:15.689
THAT'S OF WHAT RESEARCH ABOUT

01:48:15.755 --> 01:48:19.793
HAS ITS FASTEN THOUGH COST

01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:26.967
DOCTOR IT I THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

01:48:27.033 --> 01:48:28.368
WHAT THE REALLY THE KEY IT'S

01:48:28.435 --> 01:48:30.136
THE- OF WHY IT'S JUST NUMBER OF

01:48:30.203 --> 01:48:31.671
WELLS THERE'S ALWAYS TO BE. OR

01:48:31.738 --> 01:48:34.140
WELL OUT. OFF OUR COAST MAYBE

01:48:34.207 --> 01:48:35.942
EVEN MORE WHICH REALLY THIS.

01:48:36.009 --> 01:48:38.044
CHAIN IN THE UP WELLING HABITAT

01:48:38.111 --> 01:48:40.280
AND DYING OF THE- IT'S THERE

01:48:40.347 --> 01:48:42.015
ARE. SITE POST THE GREATEST CON.

01:48:42.082 --> 01:48:44.684
BETWEEN A CRAB YEAR AND

01:48:44.751 --> 01:48:47.187
POTENTIAL WELL AND TRYING SO

01:48:47.254 --> 01:48:48.822
THE HAVE COMPRESSION INDEX IT'S

01:48:48.889 --> 01:48:51.358
JUST. TIMES IT ACTUALLY. THE

01:48:51.424 --> 01:48:52.859
VERY. OF THAT UP WELL TO WATER

01:48:52.926 --> 01:48:54.761
AND IT'S NOW WE CAN'T YOU THIS

01:48:54.828 --> 01:48:56.796
SINGLE. WE HAVE A GOING BACK TO

01:48:56.863 --> 01:48:59.165
THE EIGHT RIVER LONG TERM OF

01:48:59.232 --> 01:49:01.334
IT. IT'S A TIME ZERO PROVIDES A

01:49:01.401 --> 01:49:03.403
NEW. REAL TIME MAJOR OF UP

01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:05.839
WELLING HAVE THAT'S NOT AND I'D

01:49:05.906 --> 01:49:07.040
THAT WE CAN. THAT TOOL TO

01:49:07.107 --> 01:49:08.575
DETECT FUTURE LIMITS. IN THE

01:49:08.642 --> 01:49:12.212
HABITAT FOR WELL AND OUR SHOES

01:49:12.279 --> 01:49:17.317
AND FISHED OUT COMMUNITIES. THE

01:49:17.384 --> 01:49:20.086
RESULTS OF STUDY DATA PEAK OF

01:49:20.153 --> 01:49:22.989
MANY THERE'S HAVE BEEN USED FOR

01:49:23.056 --> 01:49:24.591
THE LAST THREE YEARS TO HELP ME.

01:49:24.658 --> 01:49:26.326
ENTANGLED REST IT'S TI&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;

01:49:26.393 --> 01:49:28.728
VALUE THAT. OPS ARE. IN MY- DAY

01:49:28.795 --> 01:49:30.130
BE YOU TO GUIDE DECISION MAKING.

FORMALIZING THIS PROGRAM. AND

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:23.275
MOST IMPORTANTLY WE WERE

AND EFFICIENT REPORTING. WE

02:06:40.659 --> 02:06:41.994
THINK THIS PROGRAM IS A GREAT

02:06:42.061 --> 02:06:43.162
EXAMPLE OF HOW LEVERAGING

02:06:43.228 --> 02:06:44.763

LEADER AND ENTANGLEMENT RISK

02:07:05.484 --> 02:07:08.020
SCIENCE. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT

02:07:08.087 --> 02:07:09.288
THE REGULATIONS TO FORMALIZE

02:07:09.355 --> 02:07:10.289

ISSUE WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE

02:07:19.298 --> 02:07:20.666
AND THE RAMP REGULATIONS MUST

02:07:20.733 --> 02:07:21.667
BE WRITTEN TO ADOPT WITH THIS

02:07:21.734 --> 02:07:23.969

02:09:24.056 --> 02:09:26.125
THEN AS THAT PROGRESSES IT

02:09:26.191 --> 02:09:28.293
BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT THAN FOR

02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:29.795
THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT TO

02:09:29.862 --> 02:09:33.265
FOLLOW SO SETTING UP A SCHEME

02:09:33.332 --> 02:09:33.699
THAT ALLOWS FOR SOME

02:09:33.765 --> 02:09:37.369
FLEXIBILITY. IN ORDER TO KEEP

02:09:37.436 --> 02:09:39.371
TRACK OF AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE

02:09:39.438 --> 02:09:41.607
QUICKLY MOVING SCIENCE AS LONG

02:09:41.673 --> 02:09:44.209
AS WE HAVE A WAY OF BEING ABLE

02:09:44.276 --> 02:09:45.978
TO VERIFY VALIDATE AND MAKE

02:09:46.044 --> 02:09:47.679
SURE THAT THAT SCIENCE IS

02:09:47.746 --> 02:09:49.848
KEEPING UP THAT SHOULD INFORM.

02:09:49.915 --> 02:09:51.850
THE REGULATORY PROCESS THERE

02:09:51.917 --> 02:09:54.486
AND- I THINK WE HAVE THAT

02:09:54.553 --> 02:09:56.388
OPPORTUNITY WITH ESPECIALLY

02:09:56.455 --> 02:09:58.924
HERE TO BE ABLE TO TRY AND DO

02:09:58.991 --> 02:09:59.925
SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT

02:09:59.992 --> 02:10:01.160
DIFFERENTLY THAT HAS TYPICALLY

02:10:01.226 --> 02:10:04.196
BEEN DONE. IN GOVERNMENT BEFORE

02:10:04.263 --> 02:10:06.665
AS LONG AS WE HAVE APPROPRIATE

02:10:06.732 --> 02:10:08.700
LEVELS OF OVERSIGHT. FROM THE

02:10:08.767 --> 02:10:12.137
INDUSTRY AS WELL AS FROM ALL OF

02:10:12.204 --> 02:10:12.638
THE PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE

02:10:12.704 --> 02:10:14.173
INTERESTED IN THESE ISSUES.

02:10:14.239 --> 02:10:15.274
ENSURING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:10:15.340 --> 02:10:18.177
IMPACTS. TALK ABOUT THE SITE

02:10:18.243 --> 02:10:20.979
AND BRING IN THE SCIENCE AND SO

02:10:21.046 --> 02:10:21.547
UNLIKE WHAT WE ARE SEEING AT

02:10:21.613 --> 02:10:23.415
THE FEDERAL LEVEL. WE COULD DO

02:10:23.482 --> 02:10:25.384
SOMETHING. MUCH MORE

02:10:25.450 --> 02:10:27.252
EFFICIENTLY I THINK HERE AND

02:10:27.319 --> 02:10:29.555
KEEP THE STATE ALSO I THINK

02:10:29.621 --> 02:10:31.723
NEEDS TO EXPAND ITS ROLE IN.

02:10:31.790 --> 02:10:33.659
FUNDING EXPERIMENTATION FUNDING

02:10:33.725 --> 02:10:35.861
SCIENCE AND ENSURING THAT WE

02:10:35.928 --> 02:10:37.563
ARE KEEPING THAT INFORMATION

02:10:37.629 --> 02:10:38.730
COMING TO US THAT'S ONE OF

02:10:38.797 --> 02:10:39.932
THINGS WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH

02:10:39.998 --> 02:10:41.266
THAT IS WHEN THINGS THAT. THAT

02:10:41.333 --> 02:10:43.635
WE IS AS A BODY NEED TO PAY A

02:10:43.702 --> 02:10:46.538
LITTLE BIT. MORE ATTENTION TO.

02:10:46.605 --> 02:10:48.707
AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATION.

02:10:48.774 --> 02:10:50.909
LOOKING AT ADAPTIVE PRACTICE

02:10:50.976 --> 02:10:53.178
SAYS AND EVEN STARTING TO

02:10:53.245 --> 02:10:56.181
SEPARATE IN PERMITTING. WHAT IS

02:10:56.248 --> 02:10:57.816
BENEFICIAL TO THE ENVIRONMENT

02:10:57.883 --> 02:10:59.351
INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT EVERY

02:10:59.418 --> 02:11:02.187
PERMITTING ACTION AS- WHETHER

02:11:02.254 --> 02:11:03.522
IT'S POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE

02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:05.390
ENVIRONMENT ALL AS THE KIND OF

02:11:05.457 --> 02:11:07.025
SAME THING SO. WE'RE LEARNING

02:11:07.092 --> 02:11:09.127
WE'RE TAKING STEPS AND THEN THE

02:11:09.194 --> 02:11:10.362
THAT'S WHY THIS TESTIMONY AND

02:11:10.429 --> 02:11:11.897
PERSPECTIVES ARE VERY

02:11:11.964 --> 02:11:15.567
INFORMATIVE TO US AS WE LOOK

02:11:15.634 --> 02:11:16.902
FOR TO REALLY MOVING THESE

02:11:16.969 --> 02:11:19.004
THESE FRAMEWORKS FORWARD AND

02:11:19.071 --> 02:11:20.939
EVEN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT. FISH

02:11:21.006 --> 02:11:23.008
WILD BY FLOODING THE NEW

02:11:23.075 --> 02:11:25.444
AIRCRAFT WELL. BY UTILIZING THE

02:11:25.510 --> 02:11:27.546
SCIENCE IT'S A BIG OCEAN AND

02:11:27.613 --> 02:11:29.448
IT'S SO IT AND THERE'S A LOT TO

02:11:29.514 --> 02:11:31.783
LOOK AT OUT THERE. THE BETTER

02:11:31.850 --> 02:11:32.951
WE UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE THE

02:11:33.018 --> 02:11:34.386
BETTER WE CAN DIRECT THOSE

02:11:34.453 --> 02:11:36.355
RESOURCES TO BE EFFECTIVE. MORE

02:11:36.421 --> 02:11:39.091
QUICKLY AND- MORE APPROPRIATELY

02:11:39.157 --> 02:11:41.059
GIVEN THE AND DID WHATEVER THEY

02:11:41.126 --> 02:11:42.561
THEY THE IMPACTS HAPPENING IN

02:11:42.628 --> 02:11:44.596
THE ENVIRONMENT SO I. VERY MUCH

02:11:44.663 --> 02:11:45.998
APPRECIATE THE EACH OF THE

02:11:46.064 --> 02:11:47.532
PERSPECTIVES HERE I THINK THAT

02:11:47.599 --> 02:11:49.134
FEEDS IN VERY MUCH WHAT WE WERE

02:11:49.201 --> 02:11:49.935
HEARING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION

02:11:50.002 --> 02:11:53.705
EARLIER AND I THINK NOW. FOR US

02:11:53.772 --> 02:11:55.407
AS WELL SETTING STATUTORY.

02:11:55.474 --> 02:11:56.875
POLICY AND FRAMEWORK CENTER

02:11:56.942 --> 02:11:58.443
WHICH REGULATIONS ARE DONE ANY

02:11:58.510 --> 02:12:01.880
WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF. THIS

02:12:01.947 --> 02:12:03.815
AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE

02:12:03.882 --> 02:12:04.683
THE RELATIONSHIPS THE

02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:05.717
PARTNERSHIP THE INFORMATION

02:12:05.784 --> 02:12:09.054
FLOW AND HAVE AS BEST EFFECT AS

02:12:09.121 --> 02:12:10.022
WE CAN REALLY ACROSS THE BOARD

02:12:10.088 --> 02:12:11.490
ON THE FISHERIES. THAT'S WHAT'S

02:12:11.556 --> 02:12:13.692
EXCITING ABOUT THE- TASK FORCE

02:12:13.759 --> 02:12:16.595
IN LOOKING AT. THE HAVING ALL

02:12:16.662 --> 02:12:18.196
THE PARTICIPANTS AT THE TABLE

02:12:18.263 --> 02:12:20.198
AS WE TRY AND SORT THROUGH THE

02:12:20.265 --> 02:12:20.966
CHALLENGES FOR THE INDUSTRY BUT

02:12:21.033 --> 02:12:22.634
ALSO AS WE TRY TO MANAGE OUR

02:12:22.701 --> 02:12:25.037
ENVIRONMENT SO I- THANK YOU FOR

02:12:25.103 --> 02:12:25.837
BRINGING FORTY THESE

02:12:25.904 --> 02:12:28.006
PERSPECTIVES. AND I THINK WE'RE

02:12:28.073 --> 02:12:30.742
WE HAVE A ROADMAP IF WILL STICK

02:12:30.809 --> 02:12:33.278
TO IT. THANK YOU MISTER ASHER

02:12:33.345 --> 02:12:35.681
ANY COMMENTS ON VICE CHAIRS-

02:12:35.747 --> 02:12:37.215
COMMENTS THAT HE SAID. ANY

02:12:37.282 --> 02:12:41.553
FEEDBACK. LIKE TO SAY ONE THING

02:12:41.620 --> 02:12:43.488
ABOUT THE PLANO WE SEEM TO GET

02:12:43.555 --> 02:12:44.122
CHEN THEM ON THE MIKE IF THAT'S

02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:47.959
ALRIGHT. SO SOME OF THE IDEAS

02:12:48.026 --> 02:12:50.562
THAT WE HEAR COMING- FROM

02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:52.230
OUTSIDE INDUSTRY ARE NOT

02:12:52.297 --> 02:12:54.032
PRACTICAL AND WOULD ACTUALLY

02:12:54.099 --> 02:12:56.568
HELP- ADDRESS THE ISSUE ON THE

02:12:56.635 --> 02:12:59.371
OCEAN- ONE OF THOSE IDEAS IS

02:12:59.438 --> 02:13:02.307
ROBUST HERE DOT DOT WE THINK WE

02:13:02.374 --> 02:13:03.775
HAVE MUCH BETTER IDEAS WITHIN

02:13:03.842 --> 02:13:07.012
INDUSTRY AND- IF YOU LOOK

02:13:07.079 --> 02:13:08.146
AROUND OTHER FISHERIES THAT

02:13:08.213 --> 02:13:10.582
HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH THE S. A.

02:13:10.649 --> 02:13:11.283
ISSUES AN APPLICATION PROCESS

02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:13.452
THAT. THE MATH SKILLS USED COME

02:13:13.518 --> 02:13:15.153
FROM INSIDE INDUSTRY SOMETIMES

02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:17.222
AS PART PARTNER FOR OUR

02:13:17.289 --> 02:13:19.791
RESEARCH BETWEEN- DIFFERENT

02:13:19.858 --> 02:13:21.326
GROUPS BUT ALWAYS TESTED BY

02:13:21.393 --> 02:13:23.195
FISHERMEN ON THE WATER. WEEK

02:13:23.261 --> 02:13:24.830
CIRCLE HOOK IN- PELAGIC

02:13:24.896 --> 02:13:26.365
LONGLINE FISHERY THE TROLL

02:13:26.431 --> 02:13:27.933
EXCLUDE OR IN THE TRIAL

02:13:27.999 --> 02:13:29.701
FISHERIES OFF THE WEST COAST

02:13:29.768 --> 02:13:31.136
THESE ARE SIMPLE PRACTICAL

02:13:31.203 --> 02:13:34.272
SOLUTIONS AND THAT'S USUALLY

02:13:34.339 --> 02:13:34.873
WHERE WE'RE GONNA THAT'S WE'RE

02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:36.341
GOING TO. THAT THE MAGIC PILL

02:13:36.408 --> 02:13:37.909
HERE IT'S GONNA BE A SIMPLE

02:13:37.976 --> 02:13:39.578
PRACTICAL LOW COST SOLUTION

02:13:39.644 --> 02:13:41.146
THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE HUGE

02:13:41.213 --> 02:13:43.715
MODIFICATION THE GEAR THAT WE

02:13:43.782 --> 02:13:45.851
ALREADY FISH. AND THAT'S THAT'S

02:13:45.917 --> 02:13:47.953
WHAT WE LIKE THE- JUST LOOKING

02:13:48.019 --> 02:13:51.323
AT MORE CLOSELY. WHETHER IT'S-

02:13:51.390 --> 02:13:52.290
IT'S NOT EVEN NECESSARILY

02:13:52.357 --> 02:13:54.159
FINDING IT'S JUST BEING ALLOWED

02:13:54.226 --> 02:13:54.993
TO GO OUT THERE AND TEST SOME

02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:56.928
OF OUR OWN IDEAS IMPROVE THAT

02:13:56.995 --> 02:13:59.131
WHAT DOES AND DOESN'T WORK AND

02:13:59.197 --> 02:14:00.098
WHAT DIRECTION WE MIGHT WANT TO

02:14:00.165 --> 02:14:01.433
HEAD WITHOUT. PUTTING A PLANE

02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:03.735
IN THE AIR TO MONITOR CRAB

02:14:03.802 --> 02:14:05.170
BOATS WHILE THEY'RE FISHING AND

02:14:05.237 --> 02:14:06.805
ORCHESTRATOR MOVEMENTS AS A

02:14:06.872 --> 02:14:08.640
COMPLETELY IMPRACTICAL IDEA.

02:14:08.707 --> 02:14:09.808
THEY WANT TO USE THAT PLAN FOR

02:14:09.875 --> 02:14:11.877
MORE SURVEYS MORE COMPREHENSIVE

02:14:11.943 --> 02:14:13.845
WIDER SURVEYS AND BETTER

02:14:13.912 --> 02:14:16.581
UNDERSTANDING OF WELL DYNAMICS

02:14:16.648 --> 02:14:17.849
RIGHT ON. IF THEY THINK THEY'RE

02:14:17.916 --> 02:14:19.151
GONNA PUT THE PLANE IN THE AIR

02:14:19.217 --> 02:14:20.419
AN ORCHESTRATED CRAB FLEET

02:14:20.485 --> 02:14:21.853
THAT'S NOT A CRAB FISHERY

02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:24.256
WORKS. BUT I THINK THE IDEA IS

02:14:24.322 --> 02:14:26.124
TO BE MONITORING THE ANIMALS

02:14:26.191 --> 02:14:29.094
OUT THERE. AND I THINK WE ALSO

02:14:29.161 --> 02:14:30.962
HAVE. WELL INTENDED TO SERIOUS

02:14:31.029 --> 02:14:32.431
ISSUE BUT WELL STRIKES FROM

02:14:32.497 --> 02:14:33.965
SOME OF THE COMMERCIALS THAT

02:14:34.032 --> 02:14:35.467
NOT THE FISHING INDUSTRY BUT-

02:14:35.534 --> 02:14:37.469
FROM THE- THE SHIPS THAT ARE

02:14:37.536 --> 02:14:39.104
OUT THERE. SO THAT AIRCRAFT IS

02:14:39.171 --> 02:14:41.039
A RESOURCE REALLY TO MONITOR A

02:14:41.106 --> 02:14:43.742
NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH IS WHY.

02:14:43.809 --> 02:14:44.743
THE BETTER WE UNDERSTAND THE

02:14:44.810 --> 02:14:46.645
SCIENCE AND BEHAVIORS AND SO

02:14:46.711 --> 02:14:49.681
THAT. AS THE WARM WATER AND-

02:14:49.748 --> 02:14:51.850
COOL WATER OF UP WELLING GIVE

02:14:51.917 --> 02:14:53.718
US IDEAS OF ZONES TO LOOK AT.

02:14:53.785 --> 02:14:56.488
TRACKING THE WHALE MOVE MADE

02:14:56.555 --> 02:14:58.723
COULD BE INFORMATIVE TO YOU. ON

02:14:58.790 --> 02:15:00.826
THE WATER SO AND IT'S NOT ABOUT

02:15:00.892 --> 02:15:01.993
TRACKING THE FISHING FLEET AS

02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:03.962
MUCH AS TRACKING THE WHALES. TO

02:15:04.029 --> 02:15:06.364
INFORM THE FISHERY ABOUT WHAT

02:15:06.431 --> 02:15:08.366
THEY'RE FACING A AND IN WHAT

02:15:08.433 --> 02:15:10.368
THAT LANDSCAPE OUT THERE LOOKS

02:15:10.435 --> 02:15:11.069
LIKE. TO MAKE DECISIONS THERE

02:15:11.136 --> 02:15:13.405
SO THAT WE MINIMIZE

02:15:13.472 --> 02:15:14.706
INTERACTIONS BUT I THINK THE

02:15:14.773 --> 02:15:16.374
AIRCRAFT IS THE ALSO BORN AND

02:15:16.441 --> 02:15:18.410
I'M HOPING WILL HELP US WITH

02:15:18.477 --> 02:15:19.911
THE SHIP STRIKE ISSUE. TO BE

02:15:19.978 --> 02:15:21.346
ABLE TO MONITOR OTHER SHIPPING

02:15:21.413 --> 02:15:23.448
AND LAST I THINK THAT'S AN

02:15:23.515 --> 02:15:25.350
IMPORTANT RESOURCE. A SUBSET OF

02:15:25.417 --> 02:15:27.419
THAT IS GOING TO BE HELPING.

02:15:27.486 --> 02:15:29.855
CRAB INDUSTRY HERE. BY

02:15:29.921 --> 02:15:31.122
MONITORING IF THEY KNOW BETTER

02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:32.591
WHERE TO LOOK BECAUSE WE'RE

02:15:32.657 --> 02:15:33.325
USING MORE APPROPRIATE SCIENCE

02:15:33.391 --> 02:15:35.160
REALLY WAS MY POINT. THAT BACKS

02:15:35.227 --> 02:15:39.130
GOING TO NARROW. THE KIND OF

02:15:39.197 --> 02:15:40.632
THEIR TASK AND THEY MAKE IT

02:15:40.699 --> 02:15:42.300
MORE EFFECTIVE AND EASIER TO

02:15:42.367 --> 02:15:43.468
GET YOU THE INFORMATION YOU

02:15:43.535 --> 02:15:45.804
NEED ABOUT THE WELLS AREWHERE

02:15:45.871 --> 02:15:46.505
THE WELLS ARE SO THAT WE CAN

02:15:46.571 --> 02:15:50.041
AVOID THE CONFRONTATIONS YEAH-

02:15:50.108 --> 02:15:51.676
YEAH I'LL JUST CHIME IN AND SAY

02:15:51.743 --> 02:15:53.945
COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH WHAT

02:15:54.012 --> 02:15:54.579
YOU'VE SAID ABOUT SCIENCE BEING

02:15:54.646 --> 02:15:56.848
ABLE TO. STEER OUR RESOURCES

02:15:56.915 --> 02:15:57.849
MORE EFFECTIVELY AND I THINK

02:15:57.916 --> 02:16:00.819
THAT'S A BIG BENEFIT- AND WHAT

02:16:00.886 --> 02:16:01.419
YOU SAID ABOUT THIS BEING AN

02:16:01.486 --> 02:16:03.221
OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO

02:16:03.288 --> 02:16:04.189
REALLY BE A LEADER. IN

02:16:04.256 --> 02:16:05.056
DEVELOPING AN ADAPTIVE

02:16:05.123 --> 02:16:07.526
MANAGEMENT MODEL FOR THIS. THIS

02:16:07.592 --> 02:16:08.159
DYNAMIC AND REALLY CHALLENGING

02:16:08.226 --> 02:16:10.428
ISSUE. AND THE BAND'S POINT

02:16:10.495 --> 02:16:12.597
EXPERIMENTATION AS CRITICAL-

02:16:12.664 --> 02:16:14.499
THE INDUSTRY'S PERSPECTIVE. IS

02:16:14.566 --> 02:16:17.068
CRITICAL AND THE INNOVATION

02:16:17.135 --> 02:16:19.671
THAT WE CAN SEE HERE- COMING

02:16:19.738 --> 02:16:20.305
OUT OF THIS OUT SEE

02:16:20.372 --> 02:16:21.773
EXPERIMENTATION IT WILL BE

02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:22.908
FUNDAMENTAL TO SOLVING THIS

02:16:22.974 --> 02:16:24.910
ISSUE AND- WE KNOW THAT THERE'S

02:16:24.976 --> 02:16:26.278
AN EXPERIMENTAL FISHING PERMIT

02:16:26.344 --> 02:16:28.647
PROGRAM- UNDER DEVELOPMENT HERE

02:16:28.713 --> 02:16:30.782
AND- AND NOT TO PROVIDE A GOOD

02:16:30.849 --> 02:16:32.450
POP WAY FOR THAT. THANK YOU SO

02:16:32.517 --> 02:16:34.986
MUCH- WOULD LIKE TO GO TO MRS

02:16:35.053 --> 02:16:38.156
IN TORA. TAKING YOUR FINDINGS

02:16:38.223 --> 02:16:40.158
AND THE DATA. TO BE ABLE TO

02:16:40.225 --> 02:16:44.496
LOOK. TO MAKING- FUTURE

02:16:44.563 --> 02:16:47.399
PREDICTIONS ON CONDITIONS COULD

02:16:47.465 --> 02:16:49.568
BE BAD COULD BE GOOD BUT TALK

02:16:49.634 --> 02:16:50.969
ABOUT THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD

02:16:51.036 --> 02:16:53.038
ABOUT USING- THE DATA AND HOW

02:16:53.104 --> 02:16:56.641
WE CAN APPLY YOUR RESEARCH TO.

02:16:56.708 --> 02:16:58.410
HAVING BETTER PREDICTIONS AS WE

02:16:58.476 --> 02:17:02.881
MOVE FORWARD. I THINK OVERALL

02:17:02.948 --> 02:17:06.585
IT IT REDUCES OUR- FIND

02:17:06.651 --> 02:17:08.787
UNCERTAINTY IN THE AND INCREASE

02:17:08.853 --> 02:17:10.522
THEIR BILL ABILITY TO DETECT

02:17:10.589 --> 02:17:12.691
FALSE POSITIVE SOMEONE I MEAN

02:17:12.757 --> 02:17:13.525
BY THAT IS SAY SAY WE MAKE A

02:17:13.592 --> 02:17:15.493
DECISION MARCUS SO WITH THAT

02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:17.329
DECISION IS BUT THIS IT'S

02:17:17.395 --> 02:17:19.698
RATHER SEVERE AND- IT'S GONNA

02:17:19.764 --> 02:17:21.066
HAVE SOME SEVERE ECONOMIC

02:17:21.132 --> 02:17:22.500
IMPACTS OF THE FISHERY I THINK

02:17:22.567 --> 02:17:23.969
WE WOULD WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S

02:17:24.035 --> 02:17:25.470
GOING ON IN THE OCEAN

02:17:25.537 --> 02:17:27.272
ENVIRONMENT. IT'S NOT A BLACK

02:17:27.339 --> 02:17:29.307
BOX WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE

02:17:29.374 --> 02:17:31.576
OCEAN WE WITH MODERATE ON

02:17:31.643 --> 02:17:33.311
INCREDIBLE RESOLUTION OF

02:17:33.378 --> 02:17:35.714
SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES BUT

02:17:35.780 --> 02:17:37.082
ULTIMATELY I MEAN THE THING

02:17:37.148 --> 02:17:37.983
THAT'S MISSING FROM TODAY'S

02:17:38.049 --> 02:17:40.485
CONVERSATION ARE HEARING RATHER

02:17:40.552 --> 02:17:42.087
IS CLIMATE IN CLIMATE

02:17:42.153 --> 02:17:44.222
VARIABILITY AND IT IS

02:17:44.289 --> 02:17:45.323
INCREASING THERE'S THAT'S A

02:17:45.390 --> 02:17:46.958
FACT YEAH WITH INREASE CLIMATE

02:17:47.025 --> 02:17:48.159
VARIABILITY THAT MEANS

02:17:48.226 --> 02:17:50.996
INCREASED ECOSYSTEM VARIABILITY

02:17:51.062 --> 02:17:52.831
WHICH MEANS GREATER UNCERTAINTY

02:17:52.897 --> 02:17:54.966
WE DON'T HAVE THOSE TOOLS YET

02:17:55.033 --> 02:17:56.568
WE HAVEN'T BUILT THOSE TOOLS.

02:17:56.635 --> 02:17:58.036
AND I THINK THIS ECHOES BACK TO

02:17:58.103 --> 02:18:01.039
EARLIER WHEN WE WERE- THE

02:18:01.106 --> 02:18:02.207
SECRETARY WAS MENTIONING

02:18:02.273 --> 02:18:05.010
ASPECTS ABOUT- COMPLIANCE

02:18:05.076 --> 02:18:07.178
SCIENCE INCOME COMBAT SCIENCE

02:18:07.245 --> 02:18:08.346
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU

02:18:08.413 --> 02:18:09.781
HAVE THE MANAGEMENT LEADING THE

02:18:09.848 --> 02:18:11.416
SCIENCE WE DON'T INVEST IN

02:18:11.483 --> 02:18:13.318
CREATIVE TRANSFORMATIVE SCIENCE

02:18:13.385 --> 02:18:14.286
TO SOLVE THESE REALLY

02:18:14.352 --> 02:18:16.054
CHALLENGING PROBLEMS AND TO DO

02:18:16.121 --> 02:18:17.288
THIS WE NEED A DIVERSE

02:18:17.355 --> 02:18:18.623
STAKEHOLDER GROUP WE NEED TO

02:18:18.690 --> 02:18:19.524
HEAR FROM OUR FISHING

02:18:19.591 --> 02:18:21.826
COMMUNITIES ARE SCIENTISTS AND

02:18:21.893 --> 02:18:23.561
A CONSERVATIONIST TOGETHER SO.

02:18:23.628 --> 02:18:25.830
SPECIFICALLY THE TOOL BOX THAT

02:18:25.897 --> 02:18:29.000
I CREATED WITH MY COLLEAGUES-

02:18:29.067 --> 02:18:31.169
THAT IS GOING TO BE LIVE IN A

02:18:31.236 --> 02:18:33.405
LIVE THERE FOREVER AND MORE MY

02:18:33.471 --> 02:18:35.573
HOPE IS THAT WE CAN WE CAN

02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:38.243
DEFINITELY SEE THESE LOOMING

02:18:38.309 --> 02:18:40.512
MAJOR PER PERFECT STORMS IF YOU

02:18:40.578 --> 02:18:42.747

GOING TO BE CRITICAL. AND THEN

02:37:10.387 --> 02:37:11.889
WHAT WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT MIKE

02:37:11.955 --> 02:37:13.791
CONROY IS HERE HE'S A PRESENT

02:37:13.857 --> 02:37:15.826
IN THE WEST COAST FISHERIES- OF

02:37:15.893 --> 02:37:16.260
WEST COAST FISHERIES

02:37:16.326 --> 02:37:18.395
CONSULTANTS. HE IS GONNA BE

02:37:18.462 --> 02:37:20.430
FOCUSING ON OFFSHORE RENEWABLE

02:37:20.497 --> 02:37:21.765
ENERGY DEVELOPMENT AND THE

02:37:21.832 --> 02:37:23.534
POTENTIAL IMPACT FISHERIES.

02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:24.401
FISHERMEN IN FISHING

02:37:24.468 --> 02:37:26.303
COMMUNITIES AND HOW TO BE A TO

02:37:26.370 --> 02:37:28.605
AVOID IT. MITIGATED AND

02:37:28.672 --> 02:37:29.606
MINIMIZE AT IMPACT AND THAT'S

02:37:29.673 --> 02:37:32.976
AT A HUGE PRIORITY. FOR THIS

02:37:33.043 --> 02:37:34.978
COMMITTEE AS AT AT FISHING

02:37:35.045 --> 02:37:36.246
COMMUNITIES HAVE ENOUGH ON THE

02:37:36.313 --> 02:37:38.182
PLATE- IN HAVING ADDITIONAL

02:37:38.248 --> 02:37:40.117
CHALLENGES IS THE LAST THING WE

02:37:40.184 --> 02:37:41.919
NEED ALL RIGHT. SO WITHOUT

02:37:41.985 --> 02:37:46.089
FURTHER DO YOU THINK YOU THANK

ACTIVITIES WITH REGARD OFFSHORE

02:38:13.283 --> 02:38:15.485
WIND IN CALIFORNIA. SO I WAS

02:38:15.552 --> 02:38:16.920
ASKED TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS

02:38:16.987 --> 02:38:19.389
OPPORTUNITIES CHALLENGES AND

02:38:19.456 --> 02:38:21.592
STATUS OF WHERE WE ARE RIGHT

02:38:21.658 --> 02:38:24.494
NOW AND SO I WILL DO THAT- IN

02:38:24.561 --> 02:38:26.964
TERMS OF OPPORTUNITIES OFFSHORE

02:38:27.030 --> 02:38:29.032
WIND HAS BECOME A MATURE

02:38:29.099 --> 02:38:31.034
INDUSTRY ACROSS THE WORLD IT

02:38:31.101 --> 02:38:34.371
IT'S A- VERY EFFECTIVE-

02:38:34.438 --> 02:38:35.505
RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGY

02:38:35.572 --> 02:38:37.307
VERY COST EFFECTIVE IT'S BEEN

02:38:37.374 --> 02:38:41.178
DEPLOYED AT SCALE. IN MANY

02:38:41.245 --> 02:38:41.979
PARTS OF THE WORLD.

02:38:42.045 --> 02:38:44.448
PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE-

02:38:44.514 --> 02:38:48.051
INCREASINGLY IN ASIA AS WELL.

02:38:48.118 --> 02:38:52.756
AND WHILE. THE TECHNOLOGY THAT

02:38:52.823 --> 02:38:54.491
WE WOULD NEED IN CALIFORNIA OF

02:38:54.558 --> 02:38:56.293
FLOATING OFFSHORE WIND IS LESS

02:38:56.360 --> 02:38:58.729
DEVELOPED IT'S COMING ALONG AND

02:38:58.795 --> 02:39:00.163
I THINK IN TERMS OF THE

02:39:00.230 --> 02:39:03.133
TECHNOLOGY ITSELF- AND THE

02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:04.534
RESOURCE WE HAVE OFF OF THE

02:39:04.601 --> 02:39:06.670
CALIFORNIA COAST. OFFSHORE WIND

02:39:06.737 --> 02:39:08.205
COULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN

02:39:08.272 --> 02:39:09.973
HELPING THE STATE. MEET ITS

02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:11.508
RENEWABLE ENERGY AND CLIMATE

02:39:11.575 --> 02:39:14.845
GOALS. WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT

02:39:14.912 --> 02:39:16.346
RESOURCE OFF OF THE CENTRAL

02:39:16.413 --> 02:39:18.148
COAST IN AN EVEN BETTER

02:39:18.215 --> 02:39:19.716
RESOURCE OFF OF THE NORTH COAST

02:39:19.783 --> 02:39:20.984
IN TERMS OF THE TECHNICAL

02:39:21.051 --> 02:39:25.656
POTENTIAL AND CAPACITY FACTORS-

02:39:25.722 --> 02:39:26.990
OFFSHORE WIND IS REASONABLY

02:39:27.057 --> 02:39:28.825
COMPLIMENTARY TO THE SOLAR

02:39:28.892 --> 02:39:31.028
GENERATION PROFILE SO. WHAT

02:39:31.094 --> 02:39:34.031
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT-

02:39:34.097 --> 02:39:36.099
WHILE SOLAR GENERATION PEAKS IN

02:39:36.166 --> 02:39:37.334
THE MIDDLE THE DAY OFFSHORE

02:39:37.401 --> 02:39:39.703
WIND CAN ACTUALLY HELP US WITH

02:39:39.770 --> 02:39:42.139
OUR EVENING RAMP WHEN WE ARE

02:39:42.205 --> 02:39:46.143
OTHERWISE- RELYING ON- NATURAL

02:39:46.209 --> 02:39:48.378
GAS FOR THE MOST PART. OF THERE

02:39:48.445 --> 02:39:50.614
ARE SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL

02:39:50.681 --> 02:39:53.850
ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND- IT

02:39:53.917 --> 02:39:55.319
OFFERS US ON THE CENTRAL COAST

02:39:55.385 --> 02:39:57.254
AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE USE OF

02:39:57.321 --> 02:39:59.523
EXISTINGOF TRANSMISSION

02:39:59.589 --> 02:40:00.824
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO THOSE ARE

02:40:00.891 --> 02:40:02.859
SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES. ARE

02:40:02.926 --> 02:40:04.895
THERE ARE ALSO MANY CHALLENGES

02:40:04.962 --> 02:40:06.863
WITH REGARD OFFSHORE WIND OF

02:40:06.930 --> 02:40:08.699
THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO OUR

02:40:08.765 --> 02:40:10.233
EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE SO ON

02:40:10.300 --> 02:40:12.069
THE CENTRAL COAST WE COULD

02:40:12.135 --> 02:40:15.205
PROBABLY ACCOMMODATE. TWO TO

02:40:15.272 --> 02:40:16.740
THREE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF

02:40:16.807 --> 02:40:19.343
OFFSHORE WIND GENERATION IN

02:40:19.409 --> 02:40:21.445
EXISTING. INFRASTRUCTURE AT

02:40:21.511 --> 02:40:23.146
MORRO BAY IN DIABLO CANYON AND

02:40:23.213 --> 02:40:24.448
THAT'S A HUGE POTENTIAL

02:40:24.514 --> 02:40:27.484
BENEFIT. TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES

02:40:27.551 --> 02:40:30.654
AND TO OUR SYSTEM- BEYOND THAT

02:40:30.721 --> 02:40:31.722
HOWEVER WHEN WE LOOK UP AT THE

02:40:31.788 --> 02:40:34.891
NORTH COAST- IT WOULD TAKE

02:40:34.958 --> 02:40:36.793
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT TO

02:40:36.860 --> 02:40:38.495
EXPORT OFFSHORE WIND FROM

02:40:38.562 --> 02:40:42.099
THERE- AND REALLY IT BECOMES.

02:40:42.165 --> 02:40:43.800
NOT ONLY A QUESTION OF COST BUT

02:40:43.867 --> 02:40:45.469
IT SOME DEGREE A QUESTION OF

02:40:45.535 --> 02:40:46.570
FEASIBILITY I THINK IT'S ONE OF

02:40:46.636 --> 02:40:48.972
THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO

02:40:49.039 --> 02:40:50.273
UNDERSTAND MUCH BETTER AND

02:40:50.340 --> 02:40:51.408
WE'RE TAKING SOME STEPS TO DO

02:40:51.475 --> 02:40:54.611
THAT. THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT IS

02:40:54.678 --> 02:40:58.949
COMPLEX. ECOSYSTEMS ARE COMPLEX

02:40:59.016 --> 02:40:59.616
AND ALREADY IMPACTED AND YOU'VE

02:40:59.683 --> 02:41:01.351
HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSION. ON

02:41:01.418 --> 02:41:03.453
THAT TODAY- WE'RE TRYING TO

02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:04.821
ADDRESS THAT WITH PROACTIVE

02:41:04.888 --> 02:41:06.490
DATA COLLECTION SPATIAL

02:41:06.556 --> 02:41:10.827
PLANNING RESEARCH AND OUTREACH-

02:41:10.894 --> 02:41:12.896
THE COMMERCIAL FISHING INDUSTRY

02:41:12.963 --> 02:41:14.965
IS THE INDUSTRY MOST DIRECTLY

02:41:15.032 --> 02:41:17.334
IMPACTED. BY A OFFER WHEN

02:41:17.401 --> 02:41:19.703
DEVELOPMENT AND- FROM WHAT I

02:41:19.770 --> 02:41:21.238
HAVE SEEN LOOKING AT

02:41:21.304 --> 02:41:23.573
EXPERIENCES IN OTHER COUNTRIES

02:41:23.640 --> 02:41:26.943
THERE THERE HAVE BEEN- CREATIVE

02:41:27.010 --> 02:41:30.247
AN IMPORTANT. EFFORTS TO ENGAGE

02:41:30.313 --> 02:41:31.381
WITH THE FISHING COMMUNITY TO

02:41:31.448 --> 02:41:32.983
THINK ABOUT MEDICATION TO THINK

02:41:33.050 --> 02:41:35.452
ABOUT WHAT YOU DO. ABOUT THAT

02:41:35.519 --> 02:41:39.523
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS.

02:41:39.589 --> 02:41:41.425
CERTAIN KINDS OF FISHING

02:41:41.491 --> 02:41:43.427
PARTICULARLY TRAWLING JUST

02:41:43.493 --> 02:41:46.730
REALLY. IS FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD

02:41:46.797 --> 02:41:48.465
FROM FISHERMEN THEMSELVES LIKE

02:41:48.532 --> 02:41:49.066
THAT THERE'D BEEN A WANT TO

02:41:49.132 --> 02:41:51.001
pRISK THEIR EQUIPMENT DOING THAT

02:41:51.068 --> 02:41:52.969
AROUND OFFSHORE WIND FACILITIES

02:41:53.036 --> 02:41:56.973
AND SO- THERE'S A REAL-

02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:00.610
CHALLENGE THERE. AND FOR THAT

02:42:00.677 --> 02:42:03.113
REASON. OBVIOUSLY IN THIS IS AN

02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:04.381
IMPORTANT DISCUSSION TO HAVE

02:42:04.448 --> 02:42:06.616
HERE THE FISHING INDUSTRY HAS

02:42:06.683 --> 02:42:08.085
TO BE AT THE TABLE AND PART OF

02:42:08.151 --> 02:42:10.387
THE PROCESS AS WE LOOK AT WHERE

02:42:10.454 --> 02:42:11.855
DO WE GO WHEN WE'RE DON'T WE GO

02:42:11.922 --> 02:42:13.890
AND HOW MUCH POTENTIAL IS THERE

02:42:13.957 --> 02:42:16.326
AND HOW DO WE GET THIS DONE-

02:42:16.393 --> 02:42:17.794
TECHNOLOGY AND QUSAI I'VE

02:42:17.861 --> 02:42:19.262
MENTIONED BRIEFLY THE LAST.

02:42:19.329 --> 02:42:22.165
ISSUE A MENTION VISUAL IMPACTS

02:42:22.232 --> 02:42:23.633
CALIFORNIA COASTLINE IS.

02:42:23.700 --> 02:42:27.604
IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US IN SO

02:42:27.671 --> 02:42:30.674
MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. IN THE

02:42:30.740 --> 02:42:33.443
PROCESS WITH THE BUREAU OF THE

02:42:33.510 --> 02:42:34.911
FEDERAL BUREAU OF OCEAN ENERGY

02:42:34.978 --> 02:42:36.113
MANAGEMENT WHEN WE WERE LOOKING

02:42:36.179 --> 02:42:38.315
AT WHERE OFFSHORE WIND SHOULD

02:42:38.381 --> 02:42:40.984
GO- THE STATE WAS PRETTY

02:42:41.051 --> 02:42:42.686
ASSERTIVE ABOUT SAYING OFFER

02:42:42.752 --> 02:42:43.753
WHEN SHOULD BE FURTHER FROM

02:42:43.820 --> 02:42:46.022
SHORT TWENTY MILES OR MORE

02:42:46.089 --> 02:42:48.291
FURTHER FROM SHORE AND- THE

02:42:48.358 --> 02:42:49.759
FEDERAL AGENCY WENT ALONG WITH

02:42:49.826 --> 02:42:53.130
THAT. IN ITS INITIAL ITERATION

02:42:53.196 --> 02:42:55.532
OF CALL AREAS OR OR AREAS

02:42:55.599 --> 02:42:58.435
WHERE- LEASING COULD OCCUR YOU

02:42:58.502 --> 02:43:00.604
THE ONE. AGO WHEN THEY'RE

02:43:00.670 --> 02:43:03.607
PERFECT. ALL RIGHT SO. BUT

02:43:03.673 --> 02:43:05.775
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT HAPPENING-

02:43:05.842 --> 02:43:07.244
WE HAD OUR THIRD TASK FORCE

02:43:07.310 --> 02:43:10.514
MEETING ON TUESDAY- THE FOCUS

02:43:10.580 --> 02:43:12.582
OF THAT MEETING WAS TO LOOK AT

02:43:12.649 --> 02:43:15.685
SOME ADDITIONAL POSSIBLE AREAS

02:43:15.752 --> 02:43:18.221
THAT A GROUP OF AGENCIES

02:43:18.288 --> 02:43:20.457
FEDERAL AND STATE CAME UP WITH.

02:43:20.524 --> 02:43:21.958
TO PROBLEM SOLVE ON THE CENTRAL

02:43:22.025 --> 02:43:25.162
COAST BECAUSE THE CALL AREAS

02:43:25.228 --> 02:43:25.762
THAT WE HAD INITIALLY COME UP

02:43:25.829 --> 02:43:29.699
WITH. WERE DEEMED INCOMPATIBLE

02:43:29.766 --> 02:43:31.735
FOR MILITARY ACTIVITIES- SOME

02:43:31.801 --> 02:43:33.403
OF THOSE AREAS GO CLOSER TO THE

02:43:33.470 --> 02:43:34.638
THOSE AREAS IN GENERAL GO

02:43:34.704 --> 02:43:36.540
CLOSER SURE WE WOULD HAVE A MAP

02:43:36.606 --> 02:43:37.874
WITH THE SEVENTEEN MILE LINE

02:43:37.941 --> 02:43:41.278
AND A FIFTEEN MILE LINE. THERE

02:43:41.344 --> 02:43:43.180
ARE VISUAL SIMULATIONS BEING

02:43:43.246 --> 02:43:44.347
PREPARED THIS PUBLIC OUT

02:43:44.414 --> 02:43:45.949
REACHES IT WERE WERE AT THE

02:43:46.016 --> 02:43:47.551
VERY BEGINNING OF INFORMAL OUT

02:43:47.617 --> 02:43:49.719
REACH ON THAT AND I THINK I

02:43:49.786 --> 02:43:51.655
THINK OF. THE LAST THING I'LL

02:43:51.721 --> 02:43:53.256
SAY IS THAT THIS IS NOT JUST

02:43:53.323 --> 02:43:54.991
THE ENERGY COMMISSION WE HAVE A

02:43:55.058 --> 02:43:56.359
STRONG GROUP OF STATE AGENCIES

02:43:56.426 --> 02:43:57.894
WORKING TOGETHER THE OCEAN

02:43:57.961 --> 02:43:59.696
PROTECTION COUNCIL THE ENERGY

02:43:59.763 --> 02:44:00.197
COMMISSION HAVE REALLY

02:44:00.263 --> 02:44:04.034
PARTNERED. ON THIS AND- THE

02:44:04.100 --> 02:44:05.569
OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL IS

02:44:05.635 --> 02:44:07.170
FUNDING A NUMBER OF REALLY

02:44:07.237 --> 02:44:09.606
IMPORTANT. STUDIES THAT ARE

02:44:09.673 --> 02:44:11.174
GOING TO HELP US BETTER

02:44:11.241 --> 02:44:16.313
UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE. AND I'LL

02:44:16.379 --> 02:44:18.048
TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF THEM I

02:44:18.114 --> 02:44:19.616
I'M SURE AS WE GET INTO Q. NA

02:44:19.683 --> 02:44:20.817
BUT THE ONE THAT ALL ALL

02:44:20.884 --> 02:44:22.552
MENTIONED RIGHT NOW. IS THAT

02:44:22.619 --> 02:44:24.754
THE- PC IS CURRENTLY FINALISING

02:44:24.821 --> 02:44:26.122
A GRANT TO THE HUMBLE

02:44:26.189 --> 02:44:27.324
FISHERMAN'S MARKETING

02:44:27.390 --> 02:44:28.925
ASSOCIATION FOR MAPPING

02:44:28.992 --> 02:44:30.560
EXERCISE THAT WOULD DIRECTLY

02:44:30.627 --> 02:44:32.696
INVOLVE US FISHERMEN FROM DAHLE

02:44:32.762 --> 02:44:34.431
NORT HUMBLED MENDOCINO COUNTIES

02:44:34.497 --> 02:44:37.000
AND THEY'LL BE LOOKING AT

02:44:37.067 --> 02:44:38.635

RETROFITTED TO HELP SUSTAIN AN

02:50:26.082 --> 02:50:27.817
OFFSHORE WIND INDUSTRY I

02:50:27.884 --> 02:50:28.418
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S ALSO

02:50:28.484 --> 02:50:29.986
CONCERN AMONG- THE FISHING

02:50:30.053 --> 02:50:31.821
COMMUNITY THAT. THAT COULD

02:50:31.888 --> 02:50:33.856
OVERBURDEN THE FACILITIES THAT

02:50:33.923 --> 02:50:34.424
ARE CURRENTLY THERE FOR THE

HELPING FUND ON. IS IN THIS

03:03:35.938 --> 03:03:39.074
CASE NOT SPECIFICALLY- FISHING

03:03:39.141 --> 03:03:40.943
BUT THERE'S FISHING INVOLVED WE

03:03:41.009 --> 03:03:41.877
ASKED THE BUREAU OF OCEAN

03:03:41.944 --> 03:03:43.245
ENERGY MANAGEMENT TO CREATE A

03:03:43.312 --> 03:03:45.013

AND A SUPPLEMENTAL APPROACH AND

03:04:08.537 --> 03:04:11.874
THAT'S WHY THE OPC. WORK BOWL

03:04:11.940 --> 03:04:14.977

FOR THE STATE TO GET VERY

03:04:27.956 --> 03:04:30.159

ENERGY MANAGEMENT IS THE WAY

03:04:45.040 --> 03:04:46.642
THE PROCESS WORKS SO FOR

03:04:46.708 --> 03:04:49.011
EXAMPLE TO BE A MEMBER OF THIS

03:04:49.077 --> 03:04:51.380

ON THE COMMISSION SHE'S BEEN.

03:05:43.298 --> 03:05:45.234
ALL OVER THIS ISSUE- IN NEW

03:05:45.300 --> 03:05:46.268
MORE THAN WILLING TO BE AN

03:05:46.335 --> 03:05:48.470
INCLUDE- AND IN THE FISHING

03:05:48.537 --> 03:05:50.272
COMMUNITY I THINK THE CHALLENGE

03:05:50.339 --> 03:05:54.076
THAT WE HAVE. IT IS. NUMBER WE

03:05:54.142 --> 03:05:56.411
GOT A- CATCH GOING ON RIGHT NOW

03:05:56.478 --> 03:05:58.547
RIGHT ACROSS THE STATE IN THE

03:05:58.614 --> 03:06:00.883
IN IN ACROSS THE WEST COAST AS

03:06:00.949 --> 03:06:03.986
WELL WE GOT A- GET RID OF THAT.

03:06:04.052 --> 03:06:05.354
AND WE GOT TO FORMALIZE THE

03:06:05.420 --> 03:06:10.492

03:06:14.897 --> 03:06:15.430
BUT I BELIEVE WE HAVE THE SAME

03:06:15.497 --> 03:06:18.066
GOAL WE DEVELOP A FORMAL

03:06:18.133 --> 03:06:21.270
PROCESS. THAT FORMAL PROCESS

03:06:21.336 --> 03:06:23.639
WOULD BE FUNDED. IT WOULD BE AN

03:06:23.705 --> 03:06:29.678
INITIAL STUDY STATEWIDE- WITH

03:06:29.745 --> 03:06:30.846
FIVE TO TEN GOALS THAT WOULD BE

03:06:30.913 --> 03:06:32.981
EMBEDDED WITHIN THAT STUDY THAT

03:06:33.048 --> 03:06:35.617
WOULD BE AN INITIAL REVIEW. AND

03:06:35.684 --> 03:06:36.852
WHO WERE GONNA OFFICIALLY

03:06:36.919 --> 03:06:39.922

BELIEVED TO BE THE CAUSE OF

03:24:59.420 --> 03:25:01.155
THIS YEAR'S POOR ABUNDANCE. WE

03:25:01.222 --> 03:25:02.757
HAVE GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE

03:25:02.823 --> 03:25:04.925
THAT DAM REMOVAL CURRENTLY

CURTAILED. IN THESE DOWN YEARS

03:25:24.412 --> 03:25:26.313
WE LOOK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO

03:25:30.918 --> 03:25:31.919
ALSO LOOK TO STATE AND FEDERAL

WE'RE PROUD OF OUR SMALL PIECE-

03:31:12.593 --> 03:31:13.660
TO DEVELOP A PEER REVIEW

03:31:13.727 --> 03:31:15.996
PROCESS- IN WHICH THE SCIENCE

03:31:16.063 --> 03:31:17.598
AND THE OUTCOME. BENEFITTED

03:31:17.664 --> 03:31:18.999
FROM THE INPUT OF STAKEHOLDER

03:31:19.066 --> 03:31:20.968
PERSPECTIVES SOMETHING THAT IF

ABALONE. KELP WE TAKE A LOOK

03:33:28.195 --> 03:33:30.731

THAT ARE. EATING A LOT OF THE

03:33:56.356 --> 03:33:58.458
HELP THAT'S GREAT- THE PURPLE

03:33:58.525 --> 03:33:59.726
URCHINS CAN LIVE FOR TEN YEARS

03:33:59.793 --> 03:34:01.128
WITHOUT EATING AND THEY HAVE

03:34:01.195 --> 03:34:02.429
TEETH THAT CAN SHE THREW ROCKS

03:34:02.496 --> 03:34:04.498

03:34:04.565 --> 03:34:07.901
VERY PROLIFIC AND- THEY NEED

03:34:07.968 --> 03:34:09.603
THAT TOP PREDATOR TO KEEP FROM

03:34:09.670 --> 03:34:12.673

FISHERMEN OR THAT IS CHANGING

03:34:19.646 --> 03:34:21.048
IN OCEAN CONDITIONS I MEAN I

03:34:21.114 --> 03:34:24.251
TALKED TO MY SALMON- FISHMAN.

03:34:24.318 --> 03:34:24.818
SOMETIMES THEY THEY SAY THAT

03:34:24.885 --> 03:34:25.485
THE ANSWER OR UPDATE THE UP TO

03:34:25.552 --> 03:34:27.521
WELLINGS OF WHICH WE HEARD OUR

OKAY. SOME ASSEMBLY IT'S BODY

03:34:30.624 --> 03:34:31.725
THE WARMING TRENDS ARE STILL

03:34:31.792 --> 03:34:33.627
THERE. BUT FOR THE URGENT

03:34:33.694 --> 03:34:35.596
DIVERS THE OCEAN ACIDIFICATION

03:34:35.662 --> 03:34:36.396
IS SOMETHING TAT HASN'T BEEN

03:34:36.463 --> 03:34:37.898
MENTIONED BUT THAT IS A VERY

03:34:37.965 --> 03:34:39.233
BIG CONCERN SOFTENING OF THE

03:34:39.299 --> 03:34:41.902
SHELLS. MAYBE THAT IS. LEADING

03:34:41.969 --> 03:34:42.502
TO SOME OF THE ISSUES OF THE

03:34:42.569 --> 03:34:44.738
LONGER LASTING ON DEPRESSION

03:34:44.805 --> 03:34:46.073
THAT WE'RE WE'RE FINDING WHERE-

03:34:46.139 --> 03:34:47.574
WITH RECOVERY IS TAKING LONGER

03:34:47.641 --> 03:34:49.443
SO. THERE'S LOTS OF LOTS OF

03:34:49.509 --> 03:34:50.677
ISSUES GOING ON AND PROBABLY

03:34:50.744 --> 03:34:53.513

TWENTY SIXTH MEETING. THAT

03:35:04.157 --> 03:35:05.359
COUNCIL APPROVED ITS STRATEGIC

03:35:05.425 --> 03:35:08.161
PLAN. FOR TWENTY TWENTY THREE

03:35:08.228 --> 03:35:08.795
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IN THE FOUR

03:35:08.862 --> 03:35:09.463
MAIN GOALS WITHIN THAT PLAN

03:35:09.529 --> 03:35:11.598
ARE. CLIMB IT BIO DIVERSE CITY

03:35:11.665 --> 03:35:13.467
EQUITY IN THE BLUE ECONOMY SO

03:35:13.533 --> 03:35:14.935
THE COUNCIL'S REALLY USING NOT

03:35:15.002 --> 03:35:16.703
TO GUIDE ITS COAST IN OCEAN

03:35:16.770 --> 03:35:18.805

OCEAN HEALTH CONVERSATIONS FOR

03:35:24.745 --> 03:35:26.013
MORE THAN A DECADE AND I'LL

03:35:26.079 --> 03:35:27.414
I'LL SEE YOU AND RAISE YOU TO

AND TO SORT OF A NEW WAY OF

03:35:28.849 --> 03:35:30.017
THINKING ABOUT OCEAN HEALTH I

03:35:30.083 --> 03:35:31.551
THINK THE CONVERSATION IS

03:35:31.618 --> 03:35:33.453
INCREASINGLY TURNING TO. TO ONE

03:35:33.520 --> 03:35:34.254
OF OCEAN RESILIENCE AN

03:35:34.321 --> 03:35:36.256
ADAPTATION THAT DRAWS IN THOSE

03:35:36.323 --> 03:35:37.691
THE SOCIAL ECONOMIC AND HUMAN

03:35:37.758 --> 03:35:39.593

PRODUCTIVE VENUE FOR. ADVANCING

03:35:45.032 --> 03:35:48.001
ON WHAT IS AS MY COLLEAGUE HAS

03:35:48.068 --> 03:35:49.703

A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH CARBON

03:36:05.786 --> 03:36:09.256
DIOXIDE. SORT YOU RIGHT NO.

THAT IT IS IT'S JUST CAN WE

03:36:16.363 --> 03:36:18.799
SURVIVE IF IT ABSORBS BEYOND A

03:36:18.865 --> 03:36:19.900
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CARBON

03:36:19.966 --> 03:36:22.869
DIOXIDE THE ORIGINAL FUNCTION

03:36:22.936 --> 03:36:24.037
