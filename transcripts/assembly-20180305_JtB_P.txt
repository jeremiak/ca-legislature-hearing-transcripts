ARBOR CALIFORNIA TAX EDUCATION COUNCIL. A BIT OF CALIFORNIA. TAXPAYERS. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE CO CHAIRS SENATOR HILL ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW. MEMBERS AND STAFF. MY NAME IS ALISON SPIEGEL AND I AM C. TEX COUNCIL. SEE TECH IS HAPPY TO DISCUSS WITH THE COMMITTEE'S ISSUE NUMBER THREE IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER. C. TAC WAS INTENTIONALLY AND THOUGHTFULLY CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE. OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO TO SOLVE A PROBLEM. OTHER THAN EXISTING PROBLEM OF THE DCA TAX REPAIR PROGRAM THAT WAS FAILING. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CREATED SEATAC IT CAREFULLY CONSIDERED MANY DIFFERENT MODELS. WEIGHED THE PROS AND CONS OF EACH. AND SETTLED ON THE CURRENT NON PROFIT MODEL. BY ALL MEASURES C. TECH HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL. WHEN DCA AROUND THE TAX REPAIRS PROGRAM IT WAS COMMON TO SEE BOXES OVERFLOWING WITH APPLICATIONS THAT HAD BEEN SITTING ON PROCESS. FOR A YEAR OR LONGER. AND HEAPS OF UNCASHED CHECKS. THE DC PROGRAM WAS RUN BY SEVEN PEOPLE. IN THE ANNUAL FEES VARIED WILDLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR. IN SOME YEARS THERE WAS NO FEE AND IN OTHERS IT WASN'T AS MUCH AS FIFTY DOLLARS. IN CONTRAST SEATAC IS A MODEL OF PROCESSING EFFICIENCY. WITH A STAFF OF THREE. AND AN ANNUAL INDIVIDUAL REGISTRATION AMOUNT OF ONLY THIRTY THREE DOLLARS. IT IMMEDIATELY PROCESSES REGISTRATION OF TAX PREPARERS. AFTER TAX APPEARS COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION. WHICH IS REPORTED DIRECTLY FROM THE EDUCATION PROVIDERS TO SEATAC. REGISTRARTE TO GO ONLINE PAY THEIR ANNUAL FEE. AND AT THE END OF THE PROCESS THEY ARE NOTIFIED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN REGISTERED. AND ARE ABLE TO BEGIN PREPARING RETURNS IMMEDIATELY. C. TECH IS A PROGRAM THAT HAS WORKED SUCCESSFULLY FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE DECIDED TO CHOOSE THE STRUCTURE. IT CAREFULLY BALANCE THE PROS AND CONS. AS A PRIVATE NONPROFIT CORPORATION SEATAC HAS INCREDIBLE FLEXIBILITY. AND IS ABLE TO PROCESS APPLICATIONS IMMEDIATELY FOR VERY LOW COST. ITS POWER IS IN ITS STRUCTURE. BUT IS A PRIVATE NONPROFIT CORPORATION SEE TECH DOES NOT HAVE SITE AND FIND A FORTY. NOR DOES IT HAVE THE BENEFIT OF GOVERNANCE GOVERNMENT IMMUNITY AS A STATE AGENCY WOULD. IT ALSO IS NOT SUBJECT TO MANY OF THE LAWS APPLICABLE TO STATE AGENCIES. SUCH AS THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT OR THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT. WHILE IT IS NOT SUBJECT TO THESE PROVISIONS. IT ALSO HAS NOT RECEIVED COMPLAINTS FROM REGISTRANTS OR THE PUBLIC THAT IT IS NOT COMPLYING WITH THESE LAWS. THE LEGISLATURE BALLAD OFF BALANCE ALL OF THESE FACTORS WHEN IT CREATED SEA TAC KNOWING WHICH BODIES OF LAW WOULD AND WOULD NOT APPLY. AND WISELY DECIDED ON A PRIVATE NONPROFIT MODEL. ON THE WHOLE C. TECH BELIEVES THAT THE SCALE TIPS SIGNIFICANTLY IN FAVOR OF REGISTRATION OF TAX PREPARERS BY SEA TAC AS A PRIVATE NONPROFIT ENTITY. THE FACT THAT SEE TECH IS NOT SUBJECT TO SOME OF THE SPECIFIC LAWS IDENTIFIED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER. DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE ISN'T PUBLIC ACCESS OR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE ORGANIZATION. ON THE CONTRARY SEATAC IS A VERY TRANSPARENT ORGANIZATION WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR EXAMPLE AS A PRIVATE NONPROFIT CORPORATION WHY IS NOT SUBJECT TO BUDGET BUDGET AUDITS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IT IS SUBJECT TO ANNUAL AUDITS BY INDEPENDENT AUDITORS WHO PUBLICLY REPORT THEIR FINDINGS TO THE BOARD DURING OPEN SESSION. AND HIS REPORTS ARE AVAILABLE ON LINE TO THE PUBLIC. WHILE IT IS NOT SPECIFICALLY SUBJECT TOO BADLY KEEN. MOST OF THE GENDERS FOR BOARD MEETINGS AT LEAST A WEEK IN ADVANCE. IT'S MEETING SCHEDULE IS DETERMINED YEARS IN ADVANCE AND FOR EXAMPLE. ITS MANE OF AMBER DATES AND LOCATIONS FOR ITS TWENTY EIGHTEEN BOARD MEETINGS ARE ALREADY LISTED ON ITS WEBSITE. WHILE IT'S NOT SUBJECT TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT. ITS PROCEDURES FOR DENIAL AND DISCIPLINE ARE CLEARLY ARTICULATED IN ITS STATUTE. SEE TEX STRENGTH AND PROCESSING EFFICIENCY EFFICIENCIES COME FROM ITS STRUCTURE. AS A PRIVATE NONPROFIT CORPORATION. WHERE THE COMMITTEES TO DECIDE TO IMPOSE THE ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS OF STATE GOVERNMENT ON THIS PRIVATE NONPROFIT CORPORATION? IT WILL LOSE MANY OF THE BENEFITS IT HAS GAINED BY THIS MODEL OF OPERATION. C. TECH HAS A PROGRAM THAT WORKS VERY WELL AND SEE TECH BELIEVES THAT IT SHOULD CONTINUE IN ITS CURRENT STATE. C. TECH IS HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEES ON ANY LEGISLATIVE CHANGES THAT IT BELIEVES ARE NECESSARY. THOSE C. TECH DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY ARE NEEDED AT THIS TIME. IN RELATION TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR IDENTIFIED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER. IT WAS NEVER THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT SEATAC BE AN ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. ITS LAWS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN STRUCTURED SO THAT OTHER AGENCIES SUCH AS F. TB AND THE IRS. BE IN CHARGE OF ENFORCEMENT NOT SEATAC. THIS INTENT CAN CLEARLY BE SEEN BY THE FACT THAT SEE TECH DID NOT HAVE ANY ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY BEFORE TWENTY FOURTEEN. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN SEE TAKING THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO DENY APPLICATIONS AND DISCIPLINE REGISTRANTS. IN AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS A LIMITED ISSUE. AROUND THIS TIME SEE TEXT SAW THE LOOPHOLE WAS BEING USED BY FORMER ACCOUNTANTS. WHO LOST THEIR STATE LICENSES LICENSES DUE TO DISCIPLINARY ACTION BEING TAKEN BY THE BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY? IN THESE CASES REVOKED ACCOUNTANTS WERE REGISTERING WITH C. TECH AS TAX PREPARERS. AND SEE TECH HAD NO AUTHORITY TO DENY THE REGISTRATION OR REVOKE THEIR C. TECH REGISTRATION. THIS LOOPHOLE HAS BEEN CLOSED SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN. WELL SEE TECH HAS ONLY TAKEN DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST A HANDFUL OF INDIVIDUALS. THOSE CASES HAVE ALL STEM FROM SITUATIONS WHERE THE BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY TOOK DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST THOSE INDIVIDUALS. C. TAC IS NOT AT ITS HEART AN ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. AND IT BUT IT DOES BELIEVE THAT ADEQUATELY PROTECT THE PUBLIC BY REQUIRING ANNUAL EDUCATION FOR TAX PREPARERS. AND PAYMENT OF A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR BOND. C. TECH DOES NOT CURRENTLY REQUIRE REGISTRANTS TO SUBMIT TO LIVE SCANNED AND DOES NOT GET CRIMINAL HISTORY PORTING FROM THE DOJ OR FBI. INSTEAD SEE TECH RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM THE IRS THE BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY. AND HAS RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM TAKE DATA TREASURY INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR TAX ADMINISTRATION IN THE PAST. C. TAC DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT. IF APPLICANTS AND REGISTRANTS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK FOR C. TECH REGISTRATION. AND ANY SUCH REQUIREMENT WOULD BE QUICK WOULD CREATE OVERWHELMING ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS. THAT WOULD RESULT IN INCREASED CROP COSTS AND A LOSS OF PROCESSING EFFICIENCIES. IF SEATAC WERE TO SUDDENLY REQUIRE AND RECEIVE CRIMINAL BACKGROUND PORTS REPORTS. IT WOULD HAVE TO HIRE ATTORNEYS TO REVIEW THESE REPORTS. AND INTERPRET THEM FOR ALL APPROXIMATELY FORTY THOUSAND REGISTRANTS. THIS WOULD TAKE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME AND RESULT IN A GREATLY INCREASED EXPENSE. THEN THERE WOULD BE AN ONGOING NEED FOR ATTORNEYS TO INTERPRET SUBSEQUENT ARREST NOTIFICATIONS. AS THEY ARE RECEIVED AND TO REVIEW DOJ AND FBI REPORTS FOR NEW REGISTRANTS. APPLICANTS AND REGISTRADA BE REQUIRED TO PAY FEES FOR LIFE SCANS WHICH RANGE FROM FIFTY TO SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS A PERSON. C. TAC WOULD HAVE TO IMPLEMENT A NEW PROCESS AND PROCEDURE FOR SENDING NO LONGER INTERESTED NOTIFICATIONS TO THE DOJ. IN SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE WERE NO LONGER REGISTERED. IT WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE ITS CURRENT COMPUTER SYSTEM AND APPLICATION PROCESSING SYSTEM. SO THAT THESE CRIMINAL HISTORY REPORTS COULD BE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BEFORE REGISTRATION WOULD BE ISSUED. INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT PROCESS OF IMMEDIATELY ISSUING REGISTRATIONS. THE COST IN BOTH TIME AND MONEY. TO IMPLEMENT ALL OF THESE CHANGES WOULD BE STAGGERING. SEE TAX CURRENT SYSTEM WORKS WELL. WITH OTHERS AND GENERALLY IN CHARGE OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY NOT SEATAC. THE VAST MAJORITY OF COMPLAINTS DETECTS RECEIVES ARE FOR UNREGISTERED ACTIVITY. THESE COMPLAINTS ARE REFERRED TO FTP WHO DETERMINES AT ITS OWN DISCRETION WHICH INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO ENFORCEMENT ACTION. C. TAXIS SEES NO NEED TO CHANGE ITS HISTORIC ROLE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT INTO SOMETHING IT WAS NEVER INTENDED TO BE. AT GREAT COST TO THE REGISTRANTS. THE CURRENT SYSTEM WORKS WELL. AND SEATAC DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY LEGISLATIVE CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE IN THIS REGARD. BUT IS HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEES TO EXPLORE THIS ISSUE. WITH RESPECT TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. SUE THE REGISTRATION OF TAX PROFESSIONALS WHO CONTINUE TO. BE REGULATED BY THE CALIFORNIA TAX EDUCATION COUNCIL. HE TOOK OUT THE REMARK TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. SIMPLY STERLING WE BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE IN ITS CURRENT FORMAT. WE HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB WITH PROCESSING REGISTRATION TIMELY AND EFFICIENCY. THERE HAVE BEEN NO COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE THEATER ORGANIZATION. I'M NO CONTROVERSIAL PROGRAMS. WE BELIEVE THAT IF WE ARE ALLOWED TO PERFORM IN ITS CURRENT FORMAT. CONTINUED THE PROPER PROCESSES THAT WE HAVE NOW. AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. FROM YOUR LEGAL TAX PROFESSIONALS. WE ARE OPEN FOR YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND HE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SURE APPRECIATE THE THE OPPORTUNITY AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY ARE YOU MISTER CRAWFORD I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS. IS THE OR THE COMES TO MIND IS THAT THE THE SEA TAC HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR MANY YEARS YOU SEEM TO HAVE A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH. WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES. WHAT WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THE SUCCESS OF THE OF THE THE COUNCIL TO? IT SEEMS LIKE YOU KNOW YOU REGISTER IN A NUMBER THE RIGHT NUMBER PEOPLE YOU'RE GOING AFTER THOSE WHO HAVE HAD. WHO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO BREAK THE LAW OFFICE IN NOT REGISTERING? A WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THE SUCCESS TO. I'VE BEEN ON THE COUNCIL OF FOREIGN. ACTUALLY THE LONGEST SERVING MEMBER. ARE I BELIEVE. GOING BACK IN THE EARLY DAYS. ARM THERE ARE LOT OF COUNTLESS HOURS THAT WE'VE WORKED ON TRYING TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM A SUCCESS. BUT THE PARTNERING WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD WITH THEM AT OUR MEETINGS ON A REGULAR BASIS. OUR WE'RE ABLE TO BRAINSTORM. MEAN THESE TWO REGULATORY AGENCIES. AS TO WHERE THIS HAPPENED AFTER WHIMSY TOOK TOOK OER. THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD OF THE ORGANIZATION THAT TOLD US ABOUT FOOD ARMATURE PLAYERS. IN EXCESS OF TEN THOUSAND. WE IMMEDIATELY UNDERTOOK PROGRAMS TO TRY TO SEE IFWE CAN TO THE PROS INDIVIDUALS TO REGISTER AND THAT'S WHERE WE CAME UP WITH THE SITE AND FIND. THEM ARE PARTNERED WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO GO OUT INTO THE FIELD TO TRY TO GET THE IMAGE APPEARS TO REGISTER. WE HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL. IN THAT TOWN HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR US COMING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. GIVING THEM OUR PARENTS WE CAN HAVE THE OUR. TEETH. WE CAN FIND INDIVIDUALS FOR NOT BEING REGISTERED. WE WOULD NOT BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS WE ARE TODAY. WE THANK YOU AND ONE MORE LIKE A THANK YOU. FROM THE SEQUEL V. YOU RAISE THE ISSUE OF TRANSPARENCY AND AND. OPEN MEETINGS AND AND THE THE DUE PROCESS ISSUES THAT. COME TO MIND IN. THE TRANSPARENCY ISSUES AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF A OF A PUBLIC. BODY THAT WE WE'VE ALL NOTICED AND YOU EXPLAIN SOME OF THOSE. THOSE CONDITIONS AND THAT THE THE WAY YOU DO BUSINESS TO. TO CREATE THE THE OPENNESS OF THE OF THE ORGANIZATION AND THE COUNCIL. DO YOU FIND OR HAVE YOU. EXPERIENCED ANY PROBLEMS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED BECAUSE OF THE. FACT THAT YOUR COUNSEL OTHER THAN A GOVERNMENT BOARD OR EFFECTIVE AGENCY I MEAN YOU YOU'RE IN THE BUSINESS OF. OF REGISTERING PEOPLE NOT IN THE BUSINESS OR NEED YOUR YOUR ROLE IS NOT TO. REGULATE IN THE SENSE OF YOU'RE NOT CREATING REGULATIONS YOU'RE JUST REGISTERING AS A AS A BODY DO YOU SEE. A BETTER THIS IS BEEN A PROBLEM OR CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF YOUR ABILITY TO TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE AND HAS THERE BEEN A PROBLEM DEVELOP BECAUSE OF THAT. I CERTAINLY HAVEN'T SEEN AN ISSUE WITH THAT. I WOULD I WOULD ASK THAT LESTER AND MAYBE CELESTA DRESS THAT IS THEY ARE THE. THEY'RE INVOLVED IN EVERY MEETING BUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY ISSUES RAISED WITHOUT. AND I WOULD LIKE TO ESCORT US WE ARE HEADED MAPPING FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD PARTNERED WITH THE TECH. AREN'T WE WILL NOT HAVE THE TEETH. AND SERVICE NEVER BEEN A PROBLEM WITH THE PUBLIC UNDERSTAND. WHO THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD? THE ENFORCEMENT ARM. AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL MEMORIES ARE FIGHTING THESE A LITTLE BIT PLAYERS. BUT ALSO CORRECT IN THE PINES THEIR ISSUE. OKAY. IN I GUESS WHEN I LOOK AT. YOU KNOW THE. THE COUNCIL WAS CREATED OF TWENTY YEARS AGO. BASED ON CERTAIN CONDITIONS CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND NEEDS BASICALLY OF TRYING TO REGULATE AND A SENSE OF. ADMINISTERING THE THE THE LICENSING AND REGISTRATION OF OF THESE THE PARTICIPANTS. HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING OVER THE TWENTY YEARS THAT HAS CHANGED. IN. THE INDUSTRY THAT WOULD REQUIRE YOU TO CHANGE IN HOW YOU DO BUSINESS OR HOW YOUR STRUCTURED. AND THE. TWENTY. OH EIGHT OF THE IRS DECIDED THAT THEY. LIKED OUR PROGRAM SO MUCH THAT THEY WANTED TO DO SOMETHING NATIONALLY. AND THEY PROCEEDED TO. OFF WANT REQUIRE PETER NUMBERS THEY WANTED TO REQUIRE AND THESE WERE FOR THE NON EXEMPT PREPARERS. AND THEY ALSO WANTED A STANDARDIZED TEST FOR THESE NON EXEMPT PREPARERS AS WELL AS EDUCATION REQUIRED EDUCATION. AND I THINK AT THAT POINT SEATAC. BECAUSE THE IRS DECIDED THAT SINCE WE WERE REVIEWING THE PROVIDERS AND APPROVING THEM. THAT. THEY WERE THEN GOING TO IF THEY GOT A LETTER FROM US SAYING THAT THIS PERSON THIS PARTICULAR SCHOOL IS APPROVED. THEY WOULD AUTOMATICALLY APPROVE IT AS WELL SO. AT THAT POINT SEE TECH DECIDED THAT. WE REALLY. NEEDED TO LOOK CLOSER AT THE SCHOOLS WE WERE APPROVING AND TO REALLY. MAKE A CONCERTED EFFORT THAT ALL THE COURSES WE WERE LOOKING AT WERE. YOU. REALLY A VERY GOOD COURSES AND WE DEVELOPED A WHOLE NEW POLICY FOR THE SCHOOLS THAT WE WERE PROVING. ARE THE CURRICULA OF THE TESTS THAT WERE BEING GIVEN BY OUR PROVIDERS AND I THINK THAT WAS A VERY MAJOR CHANGE WITH SEA TAC. AND THAT WAS WITH THE. THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE IRS THAT THAT'S CORRECT VERY GOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AND THANK YOU FOR ALSO FOR. I THINK YOU'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU'VE DONE BUSINESS AND HOW YOU'VE DONE IT AND AND THE. AND BY THE. I GUESS THE EFFICIENCIES THAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO CREATE BECAUSE OF. THE FACT THAT YOUR COUNSEL AND IT'S MUCH APPRECIATED THANK YOU THINK AFTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AS SOME OF OUR GIFTED. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH I. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. I THINK THIS WAS THE EXTRAPOLATION OF. BOSS OF MINE STATE SENATOR BILL GREEN. I WASN'T WORKING FOR ME AT THAT TIME BUT I MY SIS NAME AS PART OF THE CHAPTER AND THE AUTHOR OF TEN SEVENTY SEVEN. HOWEVER WITH THAT BEING SAID ARE THERE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT STAFFERS ARE RECOMMENDING DO YOU THINK ANY OF THAT IS UNREASONABLE. THE THE ISSUES THAT. THE RECOMMENDATION FIBER. YES I WE. WOULD DO THAT REALLY DRESS THAT SAYS YEAH. IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO ARMED TO THE ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS THAT. ARE. OUTLINED IN THOSE ISSUES ARM IT WOULD IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR US AN AS ALISON POINTED OUT THE COSTS WOULD BE EXCEEDING TOOK MANY OF THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN ABLE FOR FOURTEEN YEARS OUR FEES WERE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. ARMED AND THEN THEY WERE RAISED TO THIRTY THREE DOLLARS WE TRY TO KEEP IT LOW AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE SUCCESSES OF THE PROGRAM TO BE QUITE HONEST WITH YOU OUR FEES ARE LOW. WE GET THE JOB DONE VERY QUICKLY AS FAR AS THE REGISTRATION AND IMMEDIATELY PEOPLE CAN PROCESS. STIR PREPARING OUR RETURNS SO I I THINK SOME OF THOSE WOULD PUT SUCH A BURDEN ON C. TECH THAT IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE. SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS TALKS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY YOU THINK TRANSPARENCY FOR CALIFORNIA'S. THE THE THE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WILL BE BURDENSOME. NO I AS FAR AS THAT I WAS TALKING MORE ABOUT THE THE. YOU KNOW THE INVESTIGATIVE PORTION OF IT I THINK AS HE TOOK ALREADY IS EXTREMELY TRANSPARENT ALL OF OUR YOU KNOW OUR MEETINGS THAT WE HAVE ARE VERY OPEN. WE HAVE A NOTICE PUBLISHED SEVEN SEVEN TWO HOURS IN ADVANCE. ARE YOU SUBJECT TO THE. THE BROWN ACT BUT BACK LOOKING AT. WE TRY TO FOLLOW THE BAGLEY KEENE IS NOT REQUIRED BUT NOT REQUIRED ALLISON HAS POINTED OUT WE DO SEND. WE DO.

THAT THEY COULD CERTAINLY LOOK AT OUR WEBSITE FOR ANY INFORMATION WE HAVE MANY OF OUR POLICIES ONLINE. WOULD PUT OUT NEWSLETTERS ARE TO OUR PREPARERS WHICH THEN THEY PASS ON.

DANGERFIELD JOINING ME THIS MORNING. WRITING. MR. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THANK GOD CHEERS HILL AND LOW AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REPRESENT THE BUREAU OF AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR AND THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS TODAY. HOW FUNNY HAS THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO IMPLEMENT A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM FOR THE REGULATION OF THE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR INDUSTRY? OF AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR WAS ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO WITH AN ACCIDENT OF THE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR ACT. IN FOR CLOSE TO FIFTY YEARS HAS BEEN COMMITTED TO SERVING AND PROTECTING CONSUMERS. IN THIS STATE. WHILE SUPPORTING THE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR INDUSTRY TO CREATE A FAIR AND COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE. AT ITS CORE THE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR ACT ESTABLISHES DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS TO BETTER INFORM AND PROTECT CONSUMERS. IN THEIR TRANSACTIONS WITH AUTUMN WITH REGISTERED AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR DEALER'S. THE BUREAU MEDIATES CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. INVESTIGATES POSSIBLE POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF THE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR ACT AND ITS REGULATIONS AND TAKES DISCIPLINARY ACTION TO ENFORCE VIOLATIONS OF THESE LAWS. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. THE SMOG CHECK PROGRAM WAS ADDED TO THE PAYROLLS RESPONSIBILITIES WITH THE GOAL OF REDUCING AIR POLLUTION CAUSED BY MOTOR VEHICLES. IN ADDITION TO LICENSING SMOG CHECK STATIONS INSPECTORS AND REPAIR TECHNICIANS THE BUREAU CERTIFIES INSPECTION EQUIPMENT. AND THE SCHOOLS AND INSTRUCTORS PROVIDING THE TRAINING FOR LICENSURE. ADDITIONALLY THE BUREAU ADMINISTERS. A CONSUMER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. WHICH PROVIDES REPAIR ASSISTANCE IN VEHICLE RETIREMENT OPTIONS TO CONSUMERS WHOSE VEHICLES CANNOT PASS THEIR SMOG CHECK. WOULD BE A SURPRISE. TO EMPOWER CONSUMERS THROUGH EDUCATION AND AWARENESS OF OUR PROGRAMS. WE ALSO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR AND SMOG CHECK INDUSTRY TO IMPLEMENT CHANGES AND UPDATES TO OUR PROGRAMS. AND TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR ACT. WE FACILITATE AN ADVISORY GROUP THAT MEETS QUARTERLY. WE ALSO HAVE AN AN EDUCATIONAL ADVISORY GROUP COMPRISED OF EDUCATORS SHOP OWNERS AND TECHNICIANS TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO TRAINING ISSUES.

THREE THOUSAND LICENSE BREAK AND LAMP ADJUSTERS THOSE OF THE INDIVIDUALS PERFORMING THE AND MAP AND BRAKE INSPECTIONS AND CERTIFYING THE VEHICLES ARE COMPLIANT WITH. RELEVANT LAWS. SEVEN THOUSAND SMALL CHECK STATIONS ARE ALSO LICENSED BY THE BUREAU. AND TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND SMOG CHECK INSPECTORS AND REPAIR TECHNICIANS. WE ALSO CURRENTLY CERTIFIED APPROXIMATELY FORTY FIVE HUNDRED STAR STATIONS. MEETING SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS TO PERFORM SMOG CHECKS ON THE STATE'S HIGHEST POLLUTING VEHICLES. THOSE OPERATIONS ARE PRIMARILY FUNDED BY A SMOG CERTIFICATE FEE CURRENTLY SET AT EIGHT DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS. AS WELL AS REGISTRATION AND LICENSING FEES AN ANNUAL SMOG ABATEMENT FEE. WE HAVE HAD MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS SINCE THE LAST SUNSET REVIEW. CONDUCTED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS TO THE SMOG CHECK PROGRAM THAT WERE MADE POSSIBLE BY THE LEGISLATURE. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ON BOARD DIAGNOSTIC INSPECTION SYSTEM OR O. S.. HAS STREAMLINED THE INSPECTION PROCESS FOR NEWER MODEL YEAR VEHICLES AND IS IMPROVED. THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THOSE VEHICLES NEEDING REPAIRS. THE BUREAU ALSO HAS IMPLEMENTED REAL TIME BLOCKING OF A SMALL CHICKS SMOG CHECK CERTIFICATE. WHEN FRAUDULENT INSPECTION ACTIVITY IS RECOGNIZED BY THE ON BOARD DIAGNOSTIC INSPECTION INSPECTION SYSTEM. IN CONCERT WITH THIS EFFORT. WE HAVE ALSO ESTABLISHED A SPECIALIZED ENFORCEMENT TEAM. TO PURSUE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION AGAINST DEFENDING STATIONS AND LICENSEES. ENGAGED IN FRAUDULENT SMOG CHECK INSPECTION ACTIVITY. I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT THIS TIME TO RECOGNIZE THE WORK OF PARTNER AGENCIES AT THE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS IN PARTICULAR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND THE DEPARTMENT MOTOR VEHICLES. WHO ASSIST US IN OUR ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS? I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THESE ENTITIES AS WE EXPLORE WAYS TO ENHANCE CONSUMER PROTECTION. ONE IDEA WE HAVE INFORMALLY DISCUSS WITH THE DEPARTMENT MOTOR VEHICLES IS A CHANGE TO THE VEHICLE CODE THAT WOULD ENHANCE THE BEARERS ENFORCEMENT OF THE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR ACT. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE. THIS ADMINISTRATION AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PROGRAMS. AND THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES WE PROVIDE. I WOULD NOW LIKE TO RESPOND TO. SEVERAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY THE COMMITTEE'S. THE FIRST ISSUE I WILL ADDRESS. ISSUE NUMBER THREE. IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER SUBMITTED. MIGHT COMMITTEES IS REGARDING THE ENFORCEMENT WORKLOAD OF THE BUREAU. THE BILL HAS NO NEW PROGRAMS OR PROGRAM CHANGES PLANNED THAT WOULD INCREASE ENFORCEMENT CASE WORKLOAD. AS HAS BEEN THE CASE THE LAST FEW YEARS FOLLOWING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BAR ON OBD INSPECTION SYSTEM TESTING THAT BEGAN IN. TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN. HOWEVER AS VEHICLES CONTINUED TO ADVANCE TECHNOLOGICALLY. AND IF THE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR INDUSTRY IS UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THESE ADVANCEMENTS. ADVANCEMENTS AN ADDITIONAL UNEXPECTED WORKLOAD COULD BE GENERATED. THE BEER REMAINS PREPARED TO SHIFT RESOURCES AS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS CHANGES IN THIS WORKLOAD. IN ADDITION THE BUREAU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO MANAGE AND EXPEDITE THE RESOLUTION. OF ITS CASES. SECONDLY I WILL DISCUSS ISSUE NUMBER FIVE RELATED TO ADVERTISING. SPECIFICALLY WITH RESPECT TO OUR RECENTLY ADOPTED REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE MOBILE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR DEALERS TO INCLUDE THEIR LICENSE NUMBERS OR THEIR REGISTRATION NUMBERS IN THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS. THE COMMITTEE ASKED WHETHER IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO APPLY THAT STANDARD TO ALL REGISTRANTS. AS A NEW REGULATIONS WERE ADOPTED. ON NOVEMBER TWENTY NOVEMBER SIXTEENTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN SUFFICIENT DATA IS STILL NOT AVAILABLE TO DETERMINE THEIR IMPACT ON THE UNLICENSED. MOBILE AUTO REPAIRS. HOWEVER THE BUREAU CONTINUES TO EDUCATE REGISTERED AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR DEALERS AS WELL AS CONSUMERS ON THE NEW REQUIREMENTS. BUT ALSO HAVE BEEN EDUCATING TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITIES ON REGISTERED. YEAH ENTITIES OUT THERE. THROUGH VARIOUS. AT. YEAH. VENUES WE ALSO WILL CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO INFORM PERSONS OR ENTITIES PERFORMING THESE. AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR IS ABOUT THE NEED FOR REGISTRATION AS WELL AS THE NEW ADVERTISING REQUIREMENTS. PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION. ALREADY IS REVIEWING ONLINE ADVERTISING. AND MONITORING CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. TOOK TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE REGULATIONS. BRICK AND MORTAR REPAIR FACILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO POST THEIR AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR DEALER REGISTRATIONS ALREADY IN THEIR SHOP. pEQUIVALENT TO A MOBILE A OR D. HOSTING OF THE REGISTRATION. ON THEIR VEHICLE. WHICH IS ALSO REQUIRED BY THESE REGULATIONS THE ONLINE ADVERTISING IS TYPICALLY THE VENUE BY WHICH MOBILE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR DEALERS ADVERTISE THEIR SERVICES. WHICH IS WHY IT WAS THE FOCAL POINT OF THE NEW REGULATIONS. AS WE COLLECT DATA ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ADVERTISING REGULATION. THE BUREAU WILL DETERMINE IF FURTHER REGULATION CHANGES ARE NECESSARY. LASTLY WITH REGARD TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT THE COMMITTEE HAS REQUESTED AN UPDATE REGARDING THE MINOR SERVICE REGULATION. IS BEING PURSE SUED AND DEVELOPED BY THE BUREAU OF AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR. HAS THE COMMITTEE REPORT NOTES. THE BUREAU HELD A PUBLIC WORKSHOP ON JULY TWENTIETH OF LAST YEAR TO DISCUSS REGULATORY PROPOSAL THAT WOULD HAVE EXPANDED THE EXEMPTION LISTED THAT'S CURRENTLY IN STATUTE TO INCLUDE OTHER SERVICES. DUE TO A LACK OF INDUSTRY CONSENSUS AT THIS WORKSHOP. SCALE BACK THE EXEMPTED SERVICES PORTION OF THE REGULATORY PROPOSAL. HELD ANOTHER PUBLIC WORKSHOP. JUST LAST MONTH ON FEBRUARY TWELFTH. THE BILL IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING COMMENTS THAT WERE RECEIVED AT THE SECOND WORKSHOP. THIS TIME IT'S I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE BUREAU DOES NOT HAVE AUTHORITY TO REMOVE. OR MODIFY THE CURRENT STATUTORY LIST OF EXEMPTED SERVICES. COULD BECOME NECESSARY HOWEVER TO PROTECT CONSUMERS WERE MORE EXPERTISE MAY BE REQUIRED TO WORK ON THE VEHICLE. DO YOU DO ADVANCES IN AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY. MAKING A ONE SIMPLE PROCEDURE. MORE COMPLEX ESPECIALLY FOR CERTAIN MAKES AND MODELS OF VEHICLES. THE BUREAU ONLY HAS A STORY TO EXPAND. OR ADD TO THE STATUTORY LIST OF EXTENDED SERVICES AND REGULATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. AM AVAILABLE TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY AT THIS AT THIS TIME SEEN ON ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM ANY COMPANY MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. MISSIONARY THANK YOU FOR THE. THE. THE ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS ONE OF THE CONCERNS IS. COULD EVER RISEN IN MY DISTRICT IN SOME CONCERN FROM CONSTITUENTS IS THE CLASSIC CAR. PROCESS FOR SMOG CHECK IN HOW THAT PROCESS IS COULD YOU BRIEFLY JUST OUTLINED HOW THAT WORKS TODAY. YEAH AS PROVIDED BY STATUTE. AN EXEMPTION OR I SHOULDN'T SAY AN EXEMPTION. MODIFICATION TO THE SMOG CHECK REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE QUALIFYING IS COLLECTOR CARS I THINK IS THE TERMINOLOGY IN STATUTE. IS AVAILABLE. I BELIEVE THE VEHICLE HAS TO BE INSURED AS A COLLECTOR CAR. REQUIRES THAT THE VEHICLE BE THIRTY FIVE YEARS. MULDER OLDER. AND. IT REQUIRES OR ALLOWS FOR A MODIFIED INSPECTION. TO A ELIMINATE SOME OF THE. PORTIONS OF THE SMOG CHECK REQUIREMENTS. THE ONLY THING THAT THE VEHICLE IS REQUIRED TO PASS ISM A TAILPIPE EMISSIONS INSPECTION. THAT INSPECTION IS PERFORMED AT ONE OF THE STATE'S CONTRACTED REFEREE ENTITIES. THOSE ARE. FACILITIES. ROUGHLY HALF A LITTLE OVER THIRTY THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT ARE. SET UP TO PROVIDE SPECIALIZED INSPECTIONS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE. WHERE A VEHICLE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET A NORMAL INSPECTION AT A? AT A REGULAR SIMPSON LICENSE SMOG CHECK INTO THOSE CARDS TO THIS CLASSIC CARS HAVE TO BE ARE THEY REQUIRED TO MEET THE STANDARDS NOT OF TODAY BUT OF THE DAY THAT THE CAR THE THE VEHICLE WAS. WAS MANUFACTURED RIGHT OUT OF THE STANDARDS WERE AT THAT TIME THAT THOSE ARE THE STANDARDS AT THE END OF TIME THE TIME OF THEIR REGULAR SMOG CHECK STATION WOULD NOT BE EQUIPPED TO DO THAT ARE REQUIRED TO DO IT. IN. YES AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE SOFTWARE IT'S BUILT INTO THE SMOG CHECK MACHINES. ALLOWS FOR MODIFICATION OF THOSE TESTS AT THE REFEREES. IN AND THE OTHER PART IS. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S A LIMITATION OF THE NUMBER OF MILES THAT VEHICLE CAN BE DRIVEN A YEAR. NOT IN STATUTE. IT MIGHT BE A REQUIREMENT OF THE INSURER TO. ALLOW THAT VEHICLE TO BE INSURED AS A COLLECTOR CAR ISIS SAID THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT IN STATUTE FROM OUT NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE. IF. GOOD. ALL OF THIS QUESTION WHICH. I'M JUST INTERESTED IN KNOWING IF YOU'VE GOT A CLASSIC CAR OR DO YOU COLLECT CARS ODD I KNOW THERE'S A A LOT OF NONPROFITS THAT HAVE THESE YOU KNOW. A. BIG CAR COLLECTIONS THAT. YEAH RAISE MONEY FOR THE COMMUNITIES IF THEY'RE NOT DRIVEN AT ALL THERE STILL REQUIRED TO GET SMALLER JACK'S. THIS SECTION TO SET UP THAT REQUIRES A SMOG CHECK TO PROVE THEIR ABILITY TO PASS THE INSPECTION FOR THE VEHICLE RIGHT. THAT'S THE WAY YEAH THAT'S THE WAY IT'S SET UP CURRENTLY IN LAW. THEY BEAT BILL IDEAS ON TIME. WE STILL HAVE TIME. MAYBE. NO CAPACITY ONE MORE COOL. FATAL ONE MORE QUICK QUESTION OF. THE ISSUE THE REFEREES PROGRAM AND THE REFEREE STATIONS THAT YOU HAVE YOUR THIRTY AROUND THE STATE IS THAT CONVENIENT IF YOU FOUND THAT TO BE. A PROBLEM FOR SOME I KNOW THE CONSTITUENT THAT RAISE THE ISSUE WITH ME TODAY TO DRIVE THIRTY MILES TO FIND TO GO TO A REFEREE STATION WITH THIS CLASSIC CAR. THAT WAS THIRTY MILES THERE THREE MILES BACK AT SIXTY MILES HE WAS ONLY A LOT I GUESS BUYS INSURANCE COMPANIES SHOULD MENTION. OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES PER YEAR. SO THAT PUT A LIMITATION ANY USED HALF OF IT TO TO GET TO A SMOG. CHECK STATION HAVE YOU HAD ANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE PROGRAM ACCESS OR ANY CONDITIONS. IN NO WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE ACCESS TO THE. THE FACILITIES THEY ARE SET UP THAT THEY'RE PRETTY EASY TO FIND THEIR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE IT IS A CONTRACT WE HAVE WITH THE FOUNDATION FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO THERE'S A NATURAL TIE INTO THE. THE TRAINING. OF. FUTURE TECHNICIANS AND INSPECTORS FOR THE INDUSTRY SO IT'S REALLY A NICE A. PATHWAY FOR PEOPLE IN THE. CITY SCHOOLS TO GET INTO BUT AS FAR AS. COMMENTS OR COMPLAINTS ABOUT ACCESS TO THE FACILITIES WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY BUT. BE CERTAINLY OPEN TO LOOKING AT OPTIONS CERTAINLY IN THE CASE OF SOMEONE WHO HAS LIMITATIONS. ON THAT IS BEING PLACED ON THEM FOR. MILEAGE. TO REGISTER THE VEHICLE AS A COLLECTOR CAR THAT LOOKING AT MAYBE WE CAN. I HAVE SOME IDEA IT WAYS TO GET OUT TO THE CONSUMER SUPPOSED TO THE CONSUMER COMING TO THE FACILITIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME FOR MANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE WILL NOW OPEN UP THE PORTION OF THIS MEETING FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK. DURING THIS PORTION PLEASE COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE AND YOU'LL HAVE UP TO TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION FOR THE RECORD IF YOU WISH TO DO SO. PLEASE. YES SIR I'M. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M MY NAME ARE GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CHARLIE PETERS. CCLEANER PERFORMANCE PROFESSIONALS. WE REPRESENT PEOPLE WHO DRIVE CARS. AND THE THE LAST COMMENT PROVIDED I FOUND QUITE INTERESTING AND FAT. WHAT DO WE HAVE A ANY KIND OF DATA AS TO WHETHER ANY OF THESE CARS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THESE CARS FAIL THE TASK? AND. WHAT KINDS OF REPAIRS ARE NECESSARY AND WHO'S DOING THAT AND WHAT KIND OF SUCCESS THAT HAVE WITH REPAIRS? IF ANY. IF WE DON'T FAIL ANY CARS AND IT'S KIND OF SILLY THAT. WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION AS TO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE MAYBE THIS NEEDS TO BE ELIMINATED. SOMEBODY'S COLLECTING A LOT OF MONEY AND GOING TO A LOT OF EXERCISE IF WE DON'T FEEL ANY CARS AND WE PROVIDE NO BENEFITS. WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHY A SECOND PART OF THAT QUESTION MIGHT BE? IT'S BEEN AN INDICATION OVER TIME THAT. REMOTE SENSING AS ANOTHER MEANS OF TESTING THESE VEHICLES AS THEY TRAVEL ON THE ROAD. AND THAT THESE CARS ARE NOT. EXEMPT FROM REMOTE SENSING. THE LEDGE COUNCIL PROVIDED THE INFORMATION TO THE ORIGINAL SMOG CHECK REVIEW COMMITTEE. THAT THESE CARS ARE SUBJECT TO THAT. I HAVE PROVIDED TO YOU A. pTHIS COMMITTEE OF THE SUNSET REVIEW COMMITTEE. THE LAST TIME IT WAS CONSIDERED. AND GAVE SOME SPECIFIC KINDS OF PERFORMANCE RESULTS THAT TOOK PLACE. THAT WE SEE NO PROGRESS ON THAT WHATSOEVER. ON THOSE SUGGESTIONS SO WE HAVE PROVIDED TO YOU TODAY. A SUGGESTION THAT WE IMMEDIATELY CEASE AND DESIST COLLECTION OF FINES. FOR THE SPOT CHECK PROGRAM. AND STOP THIS PROCESS. DOES NOT SEEM TO PROVIDE ANY BENEFITS WHATSOEVER. AND SO WE THINK THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA DESERVE MORE CONSIDERATION THAT THEY'RE GETTING AT THIS POINT. I WILL POINT OUT THAT THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS I REQUESTED. TO HIM IN PERSON AND REMOTELY REQUESTING TO MEET WITH THEM HE OBVIOUSLY IS NOT HAS DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE ANY INTEREST WHATSOEVER THANK YOU VERY MUCH CONSUMER ISSUES THANK THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THE MONITORING PUBLIC IN OUR MOCK MEMBERS ARE CUSTOMERS AGREE. WE ARE SUBMITTING FOR YOUR REVIEW TODAY OVER THIRTY THOUSAND CUSTOMER PETITIONS. IN FAVOR PRESERVING THE STATUTORILY EXEMPT PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE BUSINESS SMALL. IT IS ONE THAT DEPENDS ON SPEED AND VOLUME TO PROVIDE COST EFFECTIVE TOP SERVICE. AND HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS REQUIRED BY CUSTOMERS AUTOMOBILE WARRANTIES. IF YOU REMOVE THE SPEED WITH REPAIR ESTIMATE PROCEDURES. VOLUME DROP SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE COST TO CUSTOMERS WOULD GO UP POSSIBLY EVEN DOUBLE. WE'RE ALSO SUBMITTING FOR YOUR REVIEW A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE BUSINESS MODEL THE EXAM PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE SERVICES. DEVELOPED AROUND. THAT SHOULD BE NOTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN MCA MEMBERS THAT ARE STATUTORILY EXEMPT PRIMITIVE AUTOMOTIVE MAINTENANCE PROVIDERS ARE A MPS ARE ANTS. ACTUALLY OFFERED TO BE REGULATED REGULATED BY BAR WITH THE ONLY STIPULATION BEING THAT THEY NOT BE FORCED INTO REPAIR ESTIMATE PROCEDURES THAT DESTROY THEIR BUSINESS MODEL. THE RESULT WAS SB SEVEN SEVEN EIGHT WHICH IS REFERRED TO IN THE BACKGROUND REPORT WE WILL ALSO BE SUBMITTING. IT WAS NEVER ABOUT ABSOLUTE VERSUS BAR. IT'S ABOUT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS HAVING ACCESS TO COST EFFECTIVE PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE VERSES DEFERRING UNNECESSARY MAINTENANCE AND ADDING UP WITH EXPENSIVE REPAIRS. AS IT STANDS TODAY THE AGING OF THE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR ACTS STATUTORY EXEMPTION. PERMITTED A MAINTENANCE CONTINUES TO ACCOMPLISH EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS INTENDED TO DO.

AND THE PROFESSIONAL OPERATORS AT REFINE THEIR DELIVERY INTO A SUCCESSFUL STREAMLINE BUSINESS MODEL EMPLOY THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD PAYING JOBS PEOPLE WHO LOVE OF. THANK YOU YOU EXPECTED PLEASE. AM I GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS BUT RICE I AM PRESIDENT OF CALLIE BC I'M ALSO ON THE BAR EDUCATIONAL COMMITTEE. AND I DID WANT TO SAY THAT THE BAR ADVISORY GROUP IS CRITICAL TO OUR BAR OPERATES WITH WITH INDUSTRY. I WANTED TO SAY THAT BAR WE WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT IT TOO MUCH BUT WHAT THE THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAY IS IN BETWEEN CONSUMERS AND SHOPS. AND AND IN MANY CASES THE SHOPS ARE TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO GOOD WORK SOMETIMES WE. SOMETIMES WE DON'T. OF MANY TIMES CUSTOMERS ARE WRONG AND THE BAR HELPS KIND OF FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WHAT NEAR ME AND IT HELPS TO GET IT DONE SO I'M I'M APPRECIATIVE OF ALL THE WORK THAT THEY DO. I WANTED TO JUMP ON THIS MINOR REPAIRS THING I'D LIKE TO SEE THE LEGISLATOR GIVE THE BAR THE CAPABILITY OF FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO MODIFICATIONS OR CHANGES IN STATUTE. SO RIGHT DOWN THERE TO THEIR HANDS ARE KIND OF TIED AS TO WHAT THEY CAN DO THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE CHIEF WAS TALKING ABOUT. ADDING SERVICES REMOVING SERVICES AND THAT GETS TO BE KIND OF A PAIN BUT THEY'RE THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO SEE IF WE CAN GET SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR THE GENTLEMAN THAT WERE JUST SPEAKING HERE A MINUTE AGO AND ARE FEEL THAT ANYBODY THAT FIXES CARS FOR MONEY. NEED TO HAVE NEED TO BE REGULATED YOU KNOW SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S OUR POINT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU. EXPECT A PLEASE. THANK YOU ARE JACQUELYN DONNA FROM THE HALF OF THE AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE COUNCILS OF CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS COALITION IN THE CALIFORNIA AUTO BODY ASSOCIATION. I'M ALSO ON THE MEMBER OF THE BUREAU OF AUTOMOTIVE. REPAIR ADVISORY THEY'RE SO. IN TERMS OF THE PERFORMANCE ARE DOING A GOOD JOB OF I WANT TO MAKE THREE QUICK POINTS HERE. NUMBER ONE IT WAS TOUCHED ON EARLY BY SPEAKER THE BEER ADVISER COMMITTEE THAT I MENTION I SIT ON THE THAT THAT COMMITTEE IS COMPRISED OF INDUSTRY FOLKS. CONSUMER FOLKS AND IT MEETS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO DISCUSS INDUSTRY ISSUES THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB. AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE. IT'S IT'S A IT'S AN IMPORTANT COMMITTEE IN NEED TO CONTINUE. NUMBER TWO AND I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE DISCUSSED WITH THE DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS. IN TERMS OF AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT TO BE ART. TAKES QUITE A LONG TIME TO HAVE REGULATIONS APPROVE SOMETIME TAKE TAKE FOR FIVE YEARS. THAT'S JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE. SO THAT THAT'S IT THAT'S THE SECOND COM AND THE THIRD COMMENT IS A MINOR SERVICES ISSUE THIS IS BEEN A VERY CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE I TESTIFIED ON THIS FOUR YEARS AGO. THE MINOR SERVICES EXEMPTION WAS PUT IN PLACE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE DURING THE MUSCLE CAR ERA. AND THEY WERE EXEMPTIONS FOR GAS STATIONS BASICALLY IF YOU DID MINOR SERVICES SPARK PLUGS TIRES OF BATTERIES THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TO FALL UNDER THE B. A. R. OVERSIGHT. THINGS HAVE CONSIDERABLY CHANGED OVER THAT'S ALMOST FIFTY YEARS AGO. THE CARS INTO IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY HAS CHANGED. NOW EVEN CHANGING OIL OR AN OIL FILTER REQUIRES. EXPERTISE OF REMOVING COMPONENTS OF CONSUMERS RIGHT NOW ARE NOT BEING PROTECTED. IT'S NOT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR THE OTHER SHOPS THAT DO OIL CHANGES THE SAME SERVICE. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE EXAMINE THIS AND DETERMINE WHICH SERVICES ARE CONTINUE TO DO IT BE MINOR AND WHICH SERVICES NEED TO BE MAJOR AND AN OVERSIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE CLIFF CUSTOM MAY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION. AS THE SORT OF FOLKS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR INDUSTRY THAT DOES EVERYTHING FROM OIL CHANGES A SMALL CHECKS TO COMPLETE ENGINE REBUILT AND ACCEPT OUR WE ARE THE MOST REGULATED. AMONGST FOR. INDUSTRY IN THE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR INDUSTRY SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. WE WANNA THANK DIRECTOR TO DIRECT A WE WANT TO THANK. MISTER GRAFFITO WE BELIEVE THE AGENCY IS WORKING WONDERFULLY THE INPUT THAT WE RECEIVE BACK THE. BACK AND FORTH FEEDBACK LOOK NO ONE IS EVER GOING TO AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THE REGULATOR SAYS BUT THAT'S THE PROCESS THAT'S WHAT WE NEED WE NEED OPENNESS WHEN YOU TRANSPLANTNESS AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WHEN THERE ARE ISSUES. YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THIS MINOR REPAIR ISSUE TODAY I WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MISTER AMALA DONNA WHO SPOKE BEFORE ME. THERE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES HERE CONSUMERS ARE NOT BEING PROTECTED. WE GOT VERY INVOLVED WITH TWO BILLS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN UNFORTUNATELY GOVERNOR SIGNED ONE AND VETOED THE OTHER. I THINK IT'S TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THESE ISSUES YET AGAIN. AND SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE AND AT THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE DAY OF THE COMMITTEES AND ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AGAIN TO TRY TO DERAIL FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. HIS PROFESSIONALISM THAT HE DIDN'T STILL THROUGHOUT THE BUREAU OF AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEE NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK I WANT TO ALSO REMIND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK DURING THE NORM BILL HEARING. UP WITH THIS SAYS WITH RESPECT TO THE SUNSET DATE SO I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TO OUR WITNESSES SPEAKING IN SUPPORT AND THAT WILL NOW CONCLUDE THIS REVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA BUREAU OF AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR. I WILL NOW THEN TRANSITION TO. THE NEXT ITEM THAT WE HAVE LISTED ON OUR AGENDA. WHICH IS THE REVIEW OF THE BUREAU OF A LIKE TRONIC AN APPLIANCE REPAIR HOME FURNISHINGS AND THE THERMAL INSULATION AND SO IF. THE INDIVIDUALS FROM THE BUREAU WOULD PLEASE JOIN US HERE ON THE DICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR COULD FEEL FOR SITTING TIGHT IN KEEPING THAT SEAT WARM OR THE DURATION OF. THE TESTIMONY OF THE DAY. AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE WELL EQUIPPED AND GETTING SOME. SUGAR IN YOU SO THAT YOU'LL BE HERE FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW WITH THAT SAID OUR BUREAU CHIEF OF POLICE DRESSES WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS NICHOLAS ALL OVER THE CHIEF OF THE BUREAU OF ELECTRONIC COMPLIANCE REPAIR. HOME FURNISHINGS AND THERMAL INSULATION. WITH ME TODAY IS BEING HER FELLOW DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REPRESENT THE BUREAU AND RESPOND TO SEVERAL ISSUES AND RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER. BY WAY OF BACKGROUND I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE BUREAU'S HISTORY. FUNCTIONS AND ACTIVITIES. THE GIRL INSURERS. CONSUMER PROTECTION THROUGH ENFORCEMENT OF THREE BODIES OF LAW. THE HOME FURNISHINGS AND THERMAL INSULATION ACT. ELECTRONIC AN APPLIANCE REPAIR LAW. IN THE SONG VERBALLY CONSUMER WARRANTY ACT. AT PRESENT THERE ARE THREE CORE AREAS ON WHICH THE BUREAU FOCUSES ITS WORK. FIRST THE HOME FURNISHINGS AND THERMAL INSULATION PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN ELEVEN. AND INCLUDES THE REGULATION OF MANUFACTURERS. RETAILERS WHOLESALERS AND FLAMMABILITY STANDARDS OF HOME FURNISHINGS MATTRESSES AND INSTALLATION. SECOND. THE ELECTRONIC APPLIANCE REPAIR PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE. IN RESPONSE TO FRAUD IN THE TELEVISION REPAIRED HISTORY. OVER THE YEARS AS TECHNOLOGY HAS EVOLVED. THE PROGRAM'S REGULATORY AUTHORITY EXPANDED TO COVER THE REPAIR OF MAJOR HOME APPLIANCES. AND MOBILE PHONE REPAIR. AND LASTLY THE BUREAU REGULATES% THE SERVICE CONTRACT INDUSTRY BY ENSURING CONTRACTS COMPLY WITH THE SONG BEVERLY. CONSUMER WARRANTY ACT. AND THAT PROPER FINANCIAL RESOURCES ARE IN PLACE TO BACK THE CONTRACTS. FOR THOSE WHO MAY BE LESS FAMILIAR WITH THE SERVICE CONTRACTS. TYPICAL TYPICALLY REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT SERVICES SENATE BILL NINETEEN PASSED LAST YEAR WILL EXPAND THE BUREAU'S LICENSING POPULATION. TO INCLUDE HOUSEHOLD MOVERS. BEGINNING JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. WE'LL DISCUSS HOW THE BUREAU'S IMPLEMENTING THIS NEW RESPONSIBILITY LATER IN MY TESTIMONY. THE BUREAU COMMUNICATES WITH INDUSTRY BY PARTICIPATING IN PUBLIC AND COMMUNITY EVENTS. HOLDING WORKSHOPS ON REGULATORY CHANGES. UPDATING OUR REACH MATERIALS TO EDUCATE STAKE HOLDERS ON THE GIRLS MOST RECENT CHANGES. AND THROUGH HOLDING REGULAR ADVISORY COUNCIL MEETINGS. TO CARRY OUT OUR ENFORCEMENT MANDATE THE BUREAU INVESTIGATES CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT AND REGULATIONS. AND TAKES ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION AGAINST THOSE WHO FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS. SOME RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE BUREAU COULD IMPLEMENTING A NEW WEBSITE THAT REMOVED DUPLICATIVE AND OUTDATED INFORMATION. USING SOCIAL MEDIA TO DISSEMINATE INFORMATION REGARDING CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND RIGHTS. AND HOLDING MORE THAN TWENTY COMMUNITY OUTREACH EVENTS. FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES. DURING TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. I'VE ALSO BEEN WORKING TO FIND PROACTIVE WAYS TO MODERNIZE AND STANDARDIZE. MANDATES AND PRACTICES. FOR EXAMPLE. THE BUREAU'S INTERESTED ALLOWING BUSINESSES TO USE ELECTRONIC MEANS TO COMMUNICATE WITH CONSUMERS REGARDING ESTIMATES. INVOICING AND ORDERS. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS WE FURTHER EXPLORE THIS POSSIBILITY. I WOULD NOW LIKE TO RESPOND TO SEVERAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY THE COMMITTEE'S. FIRST. I WILL DRESS ISSUE NUMBER FIVE FROM THE BACKGROUND PAPER RELATED TO THE BUREAU'S OUT REACH. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION TO DEVELOP AN UPDATED OUT REACH PLAN UTILIZING SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. AND TARGETED INTERNET ADVERTISING. AND BETTER PLACEMENT ON WEB SEARCHES. THE BUREAU CURRENTLY ADMINISTERS PAGES ON FACEBOOK. TWITTER AND LINKEDIN TO FACILITATE. STAKEHOLDER INFORMATION AND SHARING AND THE SHARING OF IDEAS. EXAMPLES OF CURRENT OUT REACH EFFORTS INCLUDE LEVERAGING PARTNERSHIPS WITH DC BOARDS AND GIRLS TO HOST. THEIR HALF OF THE LICENSING WORKSHOPS AND TO DISTRIBUTE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS. PARTNERING WITH THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSING BOARD. TO. PRESENT AT SENIOR SCAM STOPPER VENTS. AND COLLABORATING WITH THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION TO HOST EVENTS FOCUSED ON COMMUNITY OUTREACH AT COLLEGES CITY HALLS AND SENIOR CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SINCE MY APPOINTMENT IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. WE HAVE ALSO PRIORITIZE OUR REACH TO THE INDUSTRY. ZERO STUFF HAS MET WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. TO IMPROVE PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE OF WHERE HAVE THESE PROGRAMS. THESE RECENT INDUSTRY OUT REACH EFFORTS HAVE FOCUSED ON IDENTIFYING OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE ENFORCEMENT IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INDUSTRIES. THE GIRL ALSO REGULARLY CONVENES BETTER VISOR COUNCIL ADVISORY COMMITTEE. TO BOTH INFORM THE WORK OF HALF THE AND TO SOLICIT PUBLIC INPUT. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE COMMITTEE HELD TWO MEETINGS. AND IT'S WORK FOCUSED ON THE TRANSITION OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS MOVERS TO THE GIRL. OUR REACH AND STAFFING. GIVEN THE UPCOMING ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF LICENSING OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS MOVERS THE BUREAU HAS EXPANDED THE BODY TO ADD TO INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES. AS WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE PORTENTS OF PUBLIC ACCESS TO THESE TYPES OF FORMS. WILL BEGIN WEBCASTING ITS COMMITTEE MEETINGS BEGINNING WITH ITS MARCH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MEETING. WE HAVE MADE GREAT PROGRESS TO LEVERAGE THE LIMITED RESOURCES WE HAVE AND UTILIZE TECHNOLOGY IN OUR OUR REACH EFFORTS. THE GIRL LOOKS FORWARD TO MAKING MORE PROGRESS IN THE COMING YEAR. TO ENSURE CALIFORNIANS ARE WHERE. OF THE ROLE OF THE BUREAU. AND THEIR RIGHTS. NOW I WILL DISCUSS ITEM NUMBER SIX FROM THE BACKGROUND PAPER. RELATED TO THE TRANSFER OF THE HOUSEHOLD GOODS MOVERS PROGRAM. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE SIGNING OF SP NINETEEN. AGAIN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. TO FACILITATE A SMOOTH TRANSITION OF DUTIES. IN PREPARATION FOR INTEGRATING THE DIVISION OF HOUSE HOLD GOOD MOVERS TO THE GIRLS JURISDICTION. WE HAVE CREATED A PLAN THAT OUTLINES KEY ADMINISTRATIVE DETAILS WILL WORK ON CLOSELY WITH THE CIA AND THE PC. SOME OF THE FIRST STEPS WE'VE TAKEN FOCUS ON LEARNING THE CURRENT REGULATORY SYSTEM. OBTAINING RESOURCES IDENTIFYING HOW WE NEED TO MANAGE DATA. AND HOW WE NEED TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE INDUSTRY AND PUBLIC AT LARGE ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT CHANGE. WE HAVE EXECUTED AN AGREEMENT TO ALLOW THE BUREAU TO UTILIZE PC HOUSEHOLD GOODS MOVERS PROGRAM REVENUE. TO SUPPORT THE BUREAU AN ONBOARDING NEW STAFF. TO FACILITATE THE TRANSFER OF RESPONSIBILITY. STAFF WILL WORK WITH PC FOR TRAINING ON THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE HOUSEHOLD MOVERS PROGRAM AS CURRENTLY ADMINISTERED. GIVEN THE VAST DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE WAY P. YOU SEE AND DCA PROGRAMS ARE GOVERNED. WE WILL NEED TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT TIME AND EFFORT INTO DRAFTING A NEW SET OF REGULATIONS. WE SEE THIS AS ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES WE ARE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER. BUT FEEL CONFIDENT. BUT AN OPEN AND COLLABORATIVE PROCESS WILL LEAD TO THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE OF PROTECTING CONSUMERS. AND ENSURING ENFORCEMENT TOOLS ARE IN PLACE TO LEGALLY OPERATING BUSINESSES HAVE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. AS THE BUREAU WAS FORMALLY PART OF THE RELEASE THREE PROGRAMS. WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE CA TO ADJUST THE TIMING OF OUR BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PROCESS. WE ARE FORTUNATE THAT THE TIMING OF THIS MAJOR TRANSITION OF AUTHORITY FALLS NICELY WITHIN THIS PROCESS. OUR PLAN IS TO FOCUS ON THE REGULATORY STRUCTURE WE NEED TO EFFECTIVELY CARRY OUT THE HOUSEHOLD GOODS MOVERS PROGRAM. THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN OUR BUSINESS MAPPING PROCESS AND ULTIMATELY GUIDE S TO SELECTING THE BEST IT SOLUTION FOR OUR EXPANDED PROGRAM. IN THE MEANTIME MEANTIME. WE WILL ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS BY USING THE. EXISTING CPC IT SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM IN STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS FOR ELECTRONIC CASE TRACKING. AND WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MAJOR CHALLENGES. LASTLY I WILL SHARE HOW WE ARE WORKING TO ENSURE THE INDUSTRY AND PUBLIC IS AWARE. OF THIS CHANGE IN LAW. THE BUREAU'S FOCUSED ON NOTIFYING INDUSTRY MEMBERS OF THE TRANSFER OF AUTHORITY FROM PC TO THE BUREAU AND PROVIDING CONTACT INFORMATION. FOR THE BUREAU. WE ARE FINALIZING DIRECT OUTREACH TO EXISTING LICENSEES AND CREATING EASY TO USE TOOLS LIKE A FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS FIRE FOR DISTRIBUTION. DIRECTOR PHIL AND I WILL SPEAK AT THE CALIFORNIA MOVING AND STORAGE ASSOCIATIONS ONE HUNDRED YEAR CONVENTION ON APRIL TWENTIETH TO INTRODUCE DC GAMES YOUR LEADERSHIP. PRESENT INFORMATION ABOUT LICENSING AND THE BUREAU'S IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. AND RESPOND TO QUESTIONS. LEADING UP TO JULY ONE. WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON USER FRIENDLY UPDATES TO THE WEBSITE THAT WILL ALLOW THE INDUSTRY TO GET KEY INFORMATION LIKE FORMS. LICENSING A COMPLAINT PROCEDURES. STATUTES AND REGULATIONS. THE WEBSITE WILL ALSO ALLOW. THE PUBLIC TO UTILIZE A LICENSE LOOKUP. AND THE ABILITY TO FILE ON MY COMPLAINTS. WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND SISTER AGENCIES TO SCHEDULE ADDITIONAL HOURS AND EDUCATION EFFORTS. SUCH AS THE LICENSING WORKSHOP AND PARTICIPATING IN PUBLIC EVENTS. NEXT I WILL DISCUSS ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN. RELATED TO LICENSE CONSOLIDATION. FOLLOWING ENACTMENT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY. THE BUREAU COMMISSIONED A MARKET ASSESSMENT STUDY. WHICH WAS COMPLETED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. THE ASSESSMENT FOUND THAT THE BUREAU'S LICENSE TYPE SHOULD BE DETERMINED BY THE BUSINESSES ROLE IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN NOT THE BUSINESSES COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. HOWEVER CALIFORNIA'S MANY FURNITURE MANUFACTURER. WHOLESALER AND IMPORTER LICENSES ARE DETERMINED BY WHETHER THE APPLICANT IS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES. RATHER THAN THE ACTIVITIES THE BUSINESSES PERFORM. WHICH IS THE STANDARD USED BY MANY OTHER STATES. AMENDING THE LICENSE TYPES TO FOLLOW THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE ASSESSMENT. ME SIMPLIFY THE LICENSING PROCESS. AND WOULD ALLOW THE BUREAU TO IMPLEMENT. A CONSISTENT REGULATORY SCHEME REGARDLESS OF THE LICENSEES LOCATION. THE ASSESSMENT ALSO RECOMMENDED THE BUREAU CONSIDER CONSOLIDATING ITS SEPARATE FURNITURE RETAILER. BEDDING RETAILER AND COMBINATION FURNITURE AND BEDDING RETAILER LICENSES. WALL CONSOLIDATING THE THREE LICENSES INTO ONE COMBINED LESSONS WOULD PROVIDE THE POOR WITH LICENSING EFFICIENCIES. THE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMBINED LESSONS WOULD HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATELY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ONLY OFFER FURNITURE OR BEDDING FOR CELL. THERE ARE POTENTIAL CHALLENGES TO IMPLEMENTING EITHER OF THESE CONSOLIDATION. RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING INTENSIVE OUTREACH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. A TRANSITION PERIOD FOR LICENSEES. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CHANGES AND MANY OTHER NECESSARY COMPONENTS TO SUCCESSFUL SHIFT AND LICENSING SCHEMES. WELL THIS IS SOMETHING THE BUREAU MAY CONSIDER IN THE FUTURE. WE ARE FOCUSING OUR CURRENT EFFORTS ON SUCCESSIVELY ON BOARDING THE HOUSEHOLD GOOD MOVERS REGULATORY PROGRAM. IN ADDITION WHILE THE BUREAU WOULD BE INTERESTED IN MOVING TO AN ANNUAL RENEWAL FOR THE EXISTING LICENSE TYPES TO ENSURE A MORE PREDICTABLE REVENUE STREAM ANCHOR TELL FOR SOME COSTS. THIS WOULD ALSO REQUIRE AN INTENSIVE OUTREACH EFFORT. AND HAVE IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES. WITH REGARD TO THE HOUSEHOLD GOODS MOVERS. THE BUREAU HAS IT'S BEEN MANDATED TO CONDUCT A FEE STUDY TO ASSESS THE BEST FEE STRUCTURE. BUT IT IS PREMATURE TO PREDICT WHAT THE STRUCTURE WILL LOOK LIKE OR WHAT WOULD BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE LICENSE RENEWAL CYCLE. FINALLY I WILL DRESS ISSUE NUMBER TWELVE. RELATED TO THE SERVICE CONTRACT WORKING GROUP. WHICH WAS FORMED BY THE BUREAU TO PREPARE A REPORT THAT DETAILS WHAT ASPECTS OF SERVICE CONTRACT STATUTES AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE MODIFICATION. THE WORK GROUP MADE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT THEY PRODUCE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. MANY OF WHICH WOULD STRENGTHEN THE GIRLS OVERSIGHT OF SERVICE CONTRACT ADMINISTRATORS. GRANTED BUREAU ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT TOOLS. AND ENHANCE THE BUREAU'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE CONSUMER PROTECTION. THE BUREAU AGREES IN CONCEPT WITH THE RECOMMENDATION TO STANDARDIZE THE FREE LOOK. FOR SERVICE CONTRACTS. A FREE LOOK PERIOD IS A LENGTH OF TIME WHEN A NEW SERVICE CONTRACT HOLDER MAY TERMINATE. THE CONTRACT WITHOUT PENALTIES. CURRENT LAWS INCONSISTENT WITH SOME PRODUCTS RECEIVING A THIRTY DAY PERIOD AND OTHERS A SIXTY DAY PERIOD. THE WORKING GROUP RECOMMENDED STANDARDIZING THE FREE LOOK PERIOD TO THIRTY DAYS. WHILE THE BOROUGH AGREES THAT STANDARDIZATION IS NECESSARY IN THE INTEREST OF CONSUMER PROTECTION. THE BUREAU BELIEVES THAT A STANDARD SIXTY DAY FREE LOOK. IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE SOLUTION.% THE WORKING GROUP ALSO RECOMMENDED AMENDING THE DEFINITION OF SERVICE CONTRACT TO INCLUDE CONSUMER PRODUCTS. IN FAVOR OF THE CURRENT LIST OF PRODUCTS THE BUREAU REGULATES. THE BEER WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE ANY TECHNICAL INPUT REGARDING A POSSIBLE CHANGE. TO THE STATUTE AS IT WOULD MEAN THAT ALL SERVICE CONTRACTS WOULD HAVE BUREAU OVERSIGHT. AND THEREFORE PROVIDE A PLACE FOR CONSUMERS TO BRING CONCERNS. THE BUREAU SUPPORTS THE WORKING% GROUP'S RECOMMENDATION THAT WOULD REQUIRE A UNIQUE NUMBER AND EVISION DATE ON ALL SERVICE CONTRACTS. THIS CHANGE WOULD BENEFIT INDUSTRY. CREATE TRANSPARENCY FOR CONSUMERS. AND HELP THE BUREAU RECOVER SIGNIFICANT STAFF HOURS THAT ARE CURRENTLY DEDICATED. TO DOING LINE BY LINE COMPARISONS OF DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF CONTRACTS. ANOTHER ISSUE THE WORKING GROUP CONSIDERED WAS TO ADDRESS WHEN SERVICE CONTRACTORS. ARE UNABLE TO FULFILL A REPAIR ON AN ITEM. DUE TO THE LACK OF AVAILABLE PARTS FROM THE MANUFACTURER. IN INSTANCES WHERE THE MANUFACTURER GOES OUT OF BUSINESS OR OTHERWISE FAILS TO SUPPLY THE PARTS FOR LITERATURE. THE SERVICE CONTRACTOR MAY BE LIABLE FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE PRODUCT IN LIEU OF REPAIR. THE BUREAU IS AWARE OF THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNAVAILABILITY OF PARTS. HOWEVER THIS FALLS OUTSIDE OF THE JURISDICTION. I WOULD APPRECIATE. SEE THE OPPORTUNITY TO UPDATE. THE COMMITTEE'S LONGER OPPORTUNITIES AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE SOME GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER QUESTIONS OF ANYONE. SENATOR DROP IT JUST LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT LAST POINT YOU HAD ABOUT SERVICE CONTRACTS IN THAT YOU KNOW YOU SAID THAT SERVICE. YEAH. THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE CONTRACTS IF THERE'S NO PARTS FROM THE MANUFACTURER. MAY BE REQUIRED TO AND YOU HAVE NO. AUTHORITY TO CHANGE THAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT I I DID I DIDN'T MEAN I'VE GOT THAT STRAIGHT. SO WE WE DON'T CURRENTLY. US MANUFACTURERS ARE COVERED UNDER THE SERVICE CONTRACTS CURRENTLY. THAT WOULD TAKE A LEGISLATIVE CHANGE WE COVERED THE OR WE ARE ABLE TO FORCE THE REPAIR. BUT NOT THE REQUIREMENT THAT. FAVORITE PART IS OF A REPAIR. GOT IT REPAIR PART IS YOU PUT A TIME LIMIT IN THERE THAT'S WHAT GETS REASONABLE SO THAT. IT BE MAY BE. EASY FOR YOU TO ADMINISTRATE AND WHEN YOU GET CALLS. YEAH BUT DON'T LOOK AT THIS. THANK YOU OUR LIVE TO OVER TEN YEARS ARE OVER FIFTEEN YEARS OLD. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. YOU KNOW THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME LIKE THAT MANUFACTURES A LOT OF PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE WHERE THEY DON'T MAKE THE REPAIR PARTS ANYMORE AND. THAT'S BEEN EVEN A PART OF THEIR STRATEGY SINCE WE CAN'T GO BACK TO THE MANUFACTURERS IT SEEMS PRETTY TOUGH. IT LEAVES FORWARD. IT MAY BE A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME OR SOME PERIOD OF TIME. IF YOU. REQUIRE THEM TO REPLACE REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING EQUAL I GET THAT IF IT'S LESS THAN TEN YEARS IF IT'S MORE THAN TEN YEARS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE GIVEN THAT. ANY THOUGHT. WE WOULDN'T WE'D BE HAPPY TO EXPLORE THAT WITH THE SERVICE CONTRACT INDUSTRY I MEAN I'M NOT AWARE OF IT AND IT AND EGGS. A TIMELINE THAT IS BEEN OFFERED AT THIS TIME BUT. I MEAN IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING IS ONE OF THE I USED TO BE IN THIS BUSINESS WERE YEAH WE DID SERVICE CONTRACTS AND YOU KNOW WE. WERE WE REPAIRED A LOT OF MAKES IT A LOT OF MODELS AND HAD SERVICE CONTRACTS AND MOST OF THEM YOU CAN GET. A RADIO REPAIR PARTS BIRD HE JUST SEEM TO BE BUT. YOU HAVE YET A REPAIR PART THAT'S WORTH FORTY OR FIFTY BUCKS AND THAT. THE APPLIANCE NOW IS OBSOLETE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET THAT FORTY OR FIFTY DOLLAR PART HE GOT SERVICE CONTRACTOR HAVING TO BUY A FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR ITEM. I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S SOME FOOD FOR THOUGHT. THANK YOU. YES THE DOCTOR CAN. I JUST WANTED. OKAY I JUST WANT THE FAULT ISSUE NUMBER FOR STAFFING I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE. AT RISE AND AND A VACANCIES SIGH NOTED THAT WAS MENTIONED WAS IS THAT. RETIREMENT SENIOR FIELD STAFF. YES TERMS OF WHAT MORE SHOULD WE DO TO HELP ENSURE THAT. THIS. DID YOU DO YOUR WORK YOU NEED TO HAVE THE FIELD STAFF THERE RIGHT AND I I DON'T KNOW THE TERMS OF. EXAMPLES YOU'RE LOOKING OUT WHAT PERCENTAGE YOUR CURRENT STAFF ARE NEARING RETIREMENT AND WHAT ARE YOUR TREATMENT NEEDS.

TALKING ABOUT STAFFING ISSUES. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD. AN ISSUE AND WITH THE FIELD A REPRESENTATIVE THERE HAS BEEN SOME. YOU KNOW A FEW RETIREMENTS. SO SINCE I'VE BEEN THE BUREAU CHIEF WE. CHANGE THE CLASSIFICATION FOR THE FIELD STAFF TO A RE CLASSES TO SPECIALISTS TO GET HER. WHICH IS A MUCH MORE COMPETITIVE.

WE DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS HERE PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING CHERRY HILL CHAIR LOW SENATORS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND STAFF. MY NAME IS REBECCA MAY AND A SERVICE BUREAU CHIEF FOR THE PROFESSIONAL FIDUCIARY SPIRO THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE BUREAU AND ARE PENDING SUNSET. I'M JOINED BY TEAM GRAFFITI LOW DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. THE PROFESSIONAL FIDUCIARY SPIRITS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LICENSURE AND REGULATION OF NON FAMILY MEMBER PROFESSIONAL FIDUCIARY SEE INCLUDING. CONSERVATORS GUARDIANS TRUSTEES AND AGENTS UNDER DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTHCARE AND FINANCES. AS DEFINED BY THE PROFESSIONAL FIDUCIARY ACT. THE BUREAU AND THE ACT FIRST ABOLITION TWO THOUSAND SIX FIVE SP FIFTEEN FIFTY AUTHORED BY SENATOR LIZ FIGUEROA. PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC IS THE PUREST HIGHEST PRIORITY PROFESSIONAL FIDUCIARY IS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVERALL CARE OF THEIR CLIENTS WHETHER IMMEDIATE OR IN THE FUTURE. THEY MANAGE PERSONAL FINANCES BASED ON CLIENT NEEDS OFFERING SERVICES RANGING FROM BASIC BILL PAYING TO STATE AN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. OFFICIAL PRODUCERS ARE ALSO CARE HOUSING AND MEDICAL NEEDS OF SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. THE BUREAU BEGAN OPERATIONS JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND PROTECTS CONSUMERS BY PROMOTING LEGAL AND ETHICAL STANDARDS OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT. ENFORCING MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS PRIOR TO LICENSURE INVESTIGATING ALL COMPLAINTS AND TAKING DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST LICENSEES WHEN APPROPRIATE. ALSO EDUCATE CONSUMERS ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS INCLUDING THEIR RIGHT TO QUALITY SERVICE THROUGH ITS OUTREACH EFFORTS. BUREAU ISSUES ONE LICENSE TYPE THE PROFESSIONAL FISHERIES LICENSE. THE BUREAU HAS ISSUED ONE THOUSAND THIRTY NINE LICENSES SINCE ITS INCEPTION. OF WHO SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY THREE ARE CURRENTLY ACTIVE. THE BUREAU TYPICALLY ISSUES AN AVERAGE OF SEVENTY TWO NEW LICENSES EACH YEAR AND RENEWS AN AVERAGE OF FIVE UNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE LICENSES EACH YEAR. SINCE OUR SUNSET REVIEW IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE BIR HAS INCREASED THE PUREST THE BUREAU CHIEF POSITION TO FULL TIME. AND HIRED A FULL TIME ENFORCEMENT ANALYSTS WE HAVE ALSO COMPLETED A NEW STRATEGIC PLAN FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ARE UNDERGOING AN OCCUPATIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE LICENSING EXAMINATION. THE BUREAU CONTINUES TO EXPLORE WAYS TO INCREASE VISIBILITY AND OUT REACH FOR THE FIDUCIARY PROFESSION WHILE LICENSING NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED FIFTEEN PERCENT SINCE OUR LAST SUNSET REVIEW. WE CONTINUE TO ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS AND CONSUMERS TO INFORM THEM ABOUT THE BUREAU AND THE PROFESSION. WE'RE DEVELOPING AN OUT REACH PLAN WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICE THAT IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR STRATEGIC PLAN SHOULD INCREASE AWARENESS ABOUT BOTH THE FIDUCIARY PROFESSION AND THE FEAR OF. THE BEER ALSO HAS AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHICH EXAMINES THE FUNCTIONS AND POLICIES OF THE BUREAU AND MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS. IN PREPARING FOR SUNSET REVIEW THE BUREAU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO IDENTIFY AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT IN ITS FUNCTIONS. WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS TO CAN INCREASE CONSUMER PROTECTION. AND ONE AREA OF CONCERN IS LICENSEES BILLING THEIR CLIENTS FOR RESPONDING TO CONSUMER COMPLAINTS FILED WITH THE BUREAU. I'M UNAWARE OF ANY OTHER PROFESSION THAT PERMITS THIS PRACTICE. WE'RE EVALUATING THE BEST WAY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. ADDITIONALLY SOME OF THE BUREAU'S REPORTING REQUIREMENTS COULD USE UPDATING AND CLARIFYING THE BUREAU IS KEY. CONSIDERING STATUTORY CHANGES THAT WOULD BETTER SPECIFY THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH A LICENSEE IS REQUIRED TO REPORT TO THE BUREAU CASES. IN WHICH HE OR SHE HAS RESIGNED OR BEEN REMOVED AS A DIRECT RESULT OF A COMPLAINT BEING FILED WITH THE COURT. THESE CLARIFICATIONS WOULD ASSIST THE BEER AND COLLECTING THE INFORMATION IT NEEDS WHILE MAKING IT EASIER FOR LICENSEES TO COMPLY WITH REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. FINALLY THE BUREAU IS EVALUATING WAYS YOU COULD REDUCE BARRIERS TO ENTRY INTO THE PROFESSION BY INCLUDING AN EXPERIENCE ONLY BASED PATHWAY. CURRENTLY ONLY PERSONS WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE ASSOCIATE DEGREE AND THREE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE OR FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE PRIOR TWENTY TWELVE ARE QUALIFIED FOR LICENSURE. PERMITTING APPLICANTS TO USE RELEVANT EXPERIENCE AS A BASIS FOR LICENSURE MAY BROADEN THE LICENSEE POPULATION AND BRING VALUABLE EXPERIENCE BASED INSIGHT TO PROFESSIONAL FIDUCIARY. IN THE COURSE OF THEIR WORK. NOW I'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY THE COMMITTEES IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER. THE FIRST ISSUE RELATES TO THE PUREST POTENTIAL MOVE TO THE PRE SYSTEM. THE BEER WAS PART OF THE ORIGINAL RELEASE THREE OF BREEZE ND CONSISTENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PLAN. IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING WHETHER IT WILL BE USING BREEZE IN THE FUTURE. ALTHOUGH THE BUREAU IS NOT EXPERIENCING ANY BACKLOGS IN LICENSING OR ENFORCEMENT TO OUR CURRENT IT SYSTEM. THE BEER IS WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE LONG TERM SOLUTION. HAS COMPLETED ITS BUSINESS MAPPING. BUSINESS PROCESS MAPPING AND WILL CONTINUE WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO THE CALIFORNIA. I'M SORRY AND WILL WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE TO DETERMINE WHAT IT SYSTEM BEST MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE BUREAU. THIS DETERMINATION SHOULD BE MADE BY THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. UNTIL THE BUREAU AND THE DEPARTMENT TO PLAY THE PURISTS FUTURE SYSTEM THE BUREAU WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT. CURRENT DATABASE SYSTEMS TO MEET ITS CORE BUSINESS NEEDS. COMMITTEE STAFF OF ALSO ASK THE BEER TO WEIGH IN ON SURVEYING LICENSEES TO DETERMINE INTEREST IN ESTABLISHING A BUSINESS. ENTITY LICENSE BUREAU IS OPEN TO CONDUCTING THE SURVEY AND BELIEVES IT IS APPROPRIATE TO APPROACH THIS ISSUE WITH A CAREFUL UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIQUENESS OF THE FIDUCIARY CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. BECAUSE THE PHYSICAL AND FINANCIAL WELL BEING OF THE CLIENT IS SO DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON THE JUDGMENT AND ACTION OF A FIDUCIARY THE BUREAU MUST CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF ALLOWING BUSINESS ENTITIES TO SERVE IN THIS ROLE. THE PURE RECOGNIZES THAT PROVIDING AN ENTITY LICENSE MAY INCREASE CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR CLIENTS IN THE EVENT A FIDUCIARY IS NO LONGER ABLE TO CARRY OUT HIS OR HER DUTIES. OR WANTS TO RETIRE OR MOVE TO ANOTHER PROFESSION. HOWEVER GIVEN THE ROLE OF FIDUCIARY PLACE IN THEIR CLIENTS LIVES THERE ARE POTENTIAL RISKS THAT SHOULD BE MITIGATED. ANY POTENTIAL STATUTORY CHANGES RELATED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ENTITY LICENSE SHOULD INCLUDE SUFFICIENT ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY SO THAT THE BUREAU CAN CONTINUE TO UPHOLD ITS MANDATE TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. REQUIRE LICENSEES TO CARRY ADEQUATE INSURANCE POLICIES AND ENSURE THAT THE FEES ARE SET AND AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECT THE TRUE COSTS OF ADMINISTERING AND NEW LICENSE TYPE. FINALLY THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS THAT THE REGULATION OF THE PROFESSIONAL FIDUCIARY PROFESSION AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE BUREAU BE EXTENDED BY FOUR YEARS. THE BUREAUCRACIES THAT CONTINUED REGULATION OF THE PROFESSION IS NEEDED TO ENSURE CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED. THE BUREAU HAS SUCCESSFULLY UPHELD ITS CONSUMER PROTECTION MANDATE SINCE ITS INCEPTION AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO WITH A FOUR YEAR SUNSET EXTENSION. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR MANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. YOUR HELP THANK YOU VERY MUCH ONE BRIEF QUESTION IS CAN YOU BRIEFLY DESCRIBE OR DISCUSS ANY PLANS THE BUREAU MAY HAVE TO INCREASE OUR REACH. CONSUMES CONSUMERS OR LICENSEES IS THERE ANY EFFORT UNDER WAY TO TRY AND DO THAT YES WE HAVE A TWO FOLD PLAN FIRST IS OUR STRATEGIC PLAN AND WERE OF. OUT REACH IS A BIG PART OF THAT AND THAT'S ALMOST FINISHED OMINOUS IN HIS THAT'S WRAPPED UP WE'LL. GET TOGETHER AND DO LIKE AN ACTION PLANS WILL HAVE DELIVERABLES. ON AGAIN OBJECTIVES FOR OUT REACH. ADDITIONALLY WE'RE PARTNERING WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICE TO COME UP WITH A PLAN FOR OUT REACH AS WELL. AND IN THE MEANTIME I WE ATTEND A LOT OF SENIOR. SENIOR VANCE FRAUD EVENTS. CERTAINLY IF THERE'S THINGS IN YOUR DISTRICTS THAT YOU'D LIKE US TO ATTEND A WORK AWFULLY OPEN TO DOING THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH RICHARD CENTER DOT. YOU HEARD. HER RESPONSE TO YOU ABOUT THE BRIEFS IMPLEMENTATION AT THE BUREAU. YOU KNOW I. I DON'T KNOW I HAVE SOME TROUBLE MAY BE JUST FROM THE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF UNDERSTANDING YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE WITH THAT PROJECT OUT. WHETHER WE INTEND TO IMPLEMENT IT HERE OR NOT. SEEMS TO BE WORDS THAT THAT CAUSED ME SOME. YOUR CONCERN ON THIS ONE AND WHERE YOU ARE ON THIS SO SPECIFICALLY HAS MISSED MAY MENTIONED ARE SHE'S ABOUT TO EMBARK UPON A PROGRAM IS ABOUT. TO EMBARK ON A MUCH MORE DELIVERY OF ROBUST PROCESS TO DETERMINE. WHICH. IT PLATFORM IN FACT IN FACT WILL BE UTILIZED. BY BY PROFESSIONAL FISHER'S BUREAU YET TO BE DETERMINED WHETHER OR NOT THAT IN FACT WILL BE PRES. SHE MENTIONED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT RELEASED THREE PROGRAMS ARE THAT WE'RE IN RELEASED THREE. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY I BELIEVE. SIXTEEN PROGRAMS THAT. ARE STILL GOING TO EMBARK UPON. I'M THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PLAN SO IT IS IT'S VERY POINT I UNDERSTAND THAT. RELEASE ONE AND RELEASED TO. MANY OF THOSE PROGRAMS DID IN FACT SELECT BREEZE ARE ONE PROGRAM. THAT YOU ALL MAY BE AWARE OF SPECIFICALLY THE BEER OF CANADA CANNABIS CONTROL OF IN PART. BY LEARNING. OR HEARD. VIA THE THE LESSONS LEARNED AT HE DEPARTMENT UNDERTOOK IN RELEASE ONE. THE BUREAU OF CATS CAN CONTROL DID NOT SELECT BREEZE AND SO AGAIN MY POINT IS THAT. RATHER THAN. COMPELLING EACH REMAINING PROGRAM AT LEAST THREE TO GO THROUGH TO GO THROUGH ARE TO SELECT BREEZE. THE PROCESS WILL DETERMINE THAT MANY FACTORS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING. WHICH IT PLATFORM WILL IN FACT BE SELECTED FOR THE REMAINING RELEASED THREE PROGRAMS. YET IT MAYBE THIS JUST DESERVES THAT A MORE BROAD DISCUSSION ABOUT BREEZY OUT IN IT IN IN GENERAL AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND IF IF. IF IT DOESN'T MEET THE NEEDS. OF THE BUREAUS. YEAH YOU DON'T WANT TO FORCE A SQUARE PEG IN A YOU KNOW IN A IN A ROUND HOLE I GET THAT BUT I ALSO GET THE FACT THERE'S ONE HELL OF A LOT OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS AND. I THINK WE JUST NEEDTO MAKE DARN SURE THAT IT YET. IT. BUT THERE IS SOME OVERSIGHT THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT IF IT IF IT IS A POSSIBILITY OF IT BEING USED EFFECTIVELY THAT WE GO THAT ROUTE. I PLAYED EVERY SENATOR AND BY DESIGN. THAT IS THE APPROACH FOR THESE RELEASED THREE. PROGRAMS AGAIN VIA THE CURRENT BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PLAN BUT DEPARTMENT. AND OTHERS HAVE DEVISED AT THIS POINT THANK YOU ROCK. THANK YOU SENATOR. ANY THAT. SENTIMENT. THANK YOU BOTH FOR JUST SUCH A QUICK QUICK QUESTION THERE'S A REFERENCE. TO THE SIZE OF YOUR ESTIMATED YOUR LICENSEE POPULATION AND IT'S MUCH SLOWER THAN THE ESTIMATE. OR THE GROWTH ESTIMATE GIVEN AND DIED BACK INTO THE SERVICE ONLY TO THE STATE SO BIG. AND THE WORLD IS SO COMPLICATED WHAT WHAT ACCOUNTS OTHER THAN THE EIGHTY PERCENT OF COST OF A LICENSE TO THE DEAD THAT DELTA BETWEEN. THE HOURS OF WHAT WAS ESTIMATED A FORECAST AND HOW SMALL IT DOES SEEM. LIKE IN A PROFESSION FOR TEACHERS TO PROVIDE A SERVICE THAT IS NECESSARY SO IS IS THERE. A PROBLEM WITH UNLICENSED ACTIVITY. AND IF SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT IT. AND. AT SO AS IN RESPONSE TO HAVING A SMALLER ZERO AS I UNDERSTAND WHEN THE BUREAU WAS FORMED THE ESTIMATES FOR THE NUMBER OF LICENSEES IS BASED OFF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAD A. DISTRIBUTION AND THAT'S WERE PRACTITIONERS AT THE TIME BEFORE THEY WERE REQUIRED TO BE LICENSED AND. WORD THAT SITE AND BELIEVE THAT THAT'S HOW THEY BEAT THE ESTIMATES OF WHAT THOUGH LICENSURE POPULATION WOULD BE. RIGHT BUT IT'S GETS CLEARLY IT'S NOT GROWING PROPORTION TO THE NEW YEAR EVEN THE POPULATION SO WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE PROFESSION. I'M I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US TO BRING MORE VISIBILITY TO THE PROFESSION AND TO THE TO THE BUREAU THERE'S BEEN A. GROWTH SINCE OUR LAST SUNSET REVIEW ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT AN ACTIVE LICENSES SO I THINK THOSE. MEMBER SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS. I NEED FOR THE PROFESSION. I GOT I THINK THAT'S CLEAR AGAIN I KNOW I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND LIKE I'M CRITICIZING I I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S MISSION QUESTION THAT RELATES TO. MORE MARKET FORCES REALLY THAN YOUR OVERSIGHT SO. IT SEEMS SELF EVIDENT TO ME THAT THAT PRESSURE PRODUCERS TO PROVIDE A SERVICE THAT STILL IT HAS TO BE TO THE EXTENT THAT. I DID YOU THE THE PUBLIC VERTICALLY THOSE IN NEED. AREN'T BEING REFERRED TO WERE CALLING UPON PROFESSIONALS. CALLS OUT A PROBLEM BECAUSE THEN CLEARLY YOU THERE FOR A REASON YOU'RE PREVENTING PROBLEMS. WHAT CERTAINLY OPEN TO INCREASING OUR EFFORTS THERE AND MANY AND ABSOLUTELY OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY HAVE? THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENTIMENT ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMES FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. CENA OPEN THE PORTION OF THE HEARING FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM A PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME TO THE MICROPHONE AND YOU ARE LIMITED TO TWO MINUTES IN NAME AND AFFILIATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU ARMCHAIR LOW ENTER HELL AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK. I'M MEREDITH TAYLOR I AM A CALIFORNIA LICENSE PROFESSIONAL FIDUCIARY. I'VE BEEN A FIDUCIARY FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE LICENSED AND I'M HERE TODAY TO. NOT ONLY FOR MYSELF AND FISHERIES BUT ALSO ON THE BEHALF ON BEHALF OF THE FACT THAT PROFESSIONAL FISHERIES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT THE CONTINUATION OF THE PROFESSIONAL FIDUCIARY SPIRO. ON WERE VERY GRATEFUL FOR BEING LICENSED AND FOR THE OVERSIGHT. AND EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE KNOWN ON NECESSARY AND REQUIRED BY LAW FOR FIFTY SHERRY'S. I'M I FEEL IT LEGITIMIZES WHAT WE DO AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. WE ALSO JUST WANTED TO GIVE OUR SUPPORT FOR THREE OF THE ISSUES. UNDER THE CURRENT SUNSET REVIEW ISSUES ARE MENTIONED. ON ISSUE NUMBER TWO UNLICENSED REPRESENTATIVES AND ENROLLED AGENTS. WE CURRENTLY THE BUREAU DOES NOT REQUIRE THE LICENSURE OF AN INDIVIDUAL. WHO ACTS AS A PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OF DISSIDENTS THE STATES AND WE FEEL THAT? THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED ON MOST FISHERIES DO DO THIS KIND OF WORK. AND WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE UNLICENSED WHO ARE DOING THIS KIND OF WORK. THE BUREAU ALSO PROVIDES AN EXEMPTION FOR FROM LICENSURE TO ENROLLED AGENTS. AND RIGHT NOW THEY ARE ABLE TO ACT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THEIR ON. THEIR. JUST AS ENROLLED AGENTS BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT IF YOU ARE DEEMED AS A FIDUCIARY. DOING A LOT MORE WORK BESIDES JUST ACTING AS A RULED AGENT AND DOING TAX RETURNS. SO THAT'S ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WE FEEL SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN OUR ACT. TO THIRD ISSUE IS THE. WHICH WAS MENTIONED THE REGISTRATION OF BUSINESS ENTITIES. WE WANTED TO PROVIDE OUR. JUST INPUT IN SUPPORT OF THAT. IT'S UP RIGHT NOW. INDIVIDUALS ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO REQUIRED AND ALLOWED TO GET LICENSED TO AND WE WANTED TO EXPAND THAT TO ALLOW ENTITIES. TO POSSIBLY BE LICENSED AND. AS WAS MENTIONED. CONTINUITY OF CARE IS AN ISSUE FOR THIS. SECTION OF INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE. AND I JUST WANT ALSO MENTION THE SECURITY OF MULTI GENERATIONAL ESTATE PLANNING THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. WERE ABLE TO STAY WITH THE SAME FIDUCIARY FIRM. ON IT WOULD BE VERY COST EFFECTIVE AND VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR CLIENTS WHO ARE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE. ON IT'S WONDERFUL THAT THEY GET TO KNOW ONE FIDUCIARY IN ONE FISHERY AGENCY AND STAY WITH THEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PUBLIC TESTIMONY ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK. SEE NONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS ME AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH DIRECTOR GRAFFITO AS WELL THAT NOW CONCLUDES THE REVIEW OF THE PROFESSIONAL FISHERIES. ZERO. AND NOW WE WILL MOVE TO THE REVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. DIRECTOR COULD FILL. WELCOME AGAIN. YEAH. PLEASE PROCEED. MAKING SURE THAT REAL. THE JAIL CHAIR LOW MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS INGA FEEL I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS. BEFORE I GET MY FORMAL REMARKS I LIKE TO EXPRESS MY SINCERE GRATITUDE. TO ALL THE SENATORS PRESENT HERE TODAY. VOTED IN SUPPORT OF MY CONCOCT FORMATION LAST WEEK MONDAY ON THE SENATE FLOOR. INTO THE FAMILY MEMBERS BY YOU COULDN'T VOTE FOR MY CONFIRMATION MANY OF YOU DIRECTLY SUPPORTED ME. THROUGH THE WORK WE ACCOMPLISHED WHILE I WAS EITHER IN OR NEAR THE ASSEMBLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR. WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. THANK YOU. I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY. TO DISCUSS THE DEPARTMENT AND SOME ISSUES OF MUTUAL INTEREST. BUT APARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS OVERSEAS THIRTY EIGHT UNIQUE LICENSING PROGRAMS COMPRISE THE BOARD'S COMMITTEES ROSE HAD A COMMISSION. BUT TO GET A LICENSE AND REGULATE OVER THREE MILLION LICENSEES AND MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED PROFESSIONAL AND ONE HUNDRED BUSINESS CATEGORIES. THE DEPARTMENT SERVES AND SUPPORTS THESE THIRTY EIGHT PROGRAMS IN THE AREAS OF ENFORCEMENT. BUDGET. PROCUREMENT. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. LEGAL. COMMUNICATIONS HUMAN RESOURCES STRATEGIC PLANNING AND TRAINING AMONG MANY OTHER SERVICES. SINCE THE DEPARTMENT LAST APPEARED BEFORE THESE COMMITTEES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WE HAVE MADE CHANGES TO INCREASE. TO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF SERVICE THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES TO ALL OF THE LICENSING ENTITIES. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A PROUD A WORKING GROUP WITH MEMBERS OF THE PROGRAMS TO SEEK INPUT AND FEEDBACK. EXPANDED THE BOREDOM BUREAU SERVICES OFFICE DISTRICT PARTNERSHIP SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS PROCESSES AND COMMUNICATION OF BEST PRACTICES ACROSS ALL BOARDS IN YOUR HOUSE. ESTABLISHED A FUTURE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT THROUGH MEMBER THROUGH MENTORSHIP TO ATTAIN YOUNG TALENT AND TACKLE SUCCESSION PLANNING. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH PLANS TO RECONVENE THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE COORDINATION COMMITTEE. TO REVIEW AND UPDATE THE UNIFORM STANDARDS FOR SUBSIDY SUBSTANCE ABUSE LICENSEES. ESTABLISH LICENSING ENFORCEMENT WORK GROUPS TO IDENTIFY AND PROVIDE BEST PRACTICES. ESTABLISH STANDARDS AND IDENTIFY TRENDS TO BENEFIT ALL THE LYSINE ENTITIES UNDER THE DEPARTMENT. DEVELOP AN INTERNAL ONLINE REGULATIONS TRACKING SYSTEM TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY FOR THE BOARDS ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ALL PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS. AND IMPLEMENT TRAINING TO HELP PROGRAMS IMPROVE THE BUDGET CHAIN PROPOSALS SUBMITTED FOR REVIEW. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A FEW MOMENTS TO ADDRESS THE THREE ISSUES THE COMMITTEES HAVE ASKED THE DEPARTMENT TO SPEAK ON. FIRST ALL DRESS ISSUE NUMBER ONE RELATED TO THE DEPARTMENTS PROVIDE A COST TO THE PROGRAMS. BY OUR CALCULATION. DISTRIBUTOR PROGRAM HAS GONE UP BETWEEN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ELEVEN TWELVE. AND TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BY FIFTY THREE PERCENT. IN COMPARISON STATE LEVEL PRO RATA CHARGE TO DCA BY CONTROL AGENCIES. BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES INCREASED BY FIFTY NINE PERCENT DURING THAT SAME TIME. THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO INCREASE IN PRO RATTA OVER THIS TIME PERIOD. HAVE BEEN DUE TO EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND RETIREMENT INCREASES. THE DEPARTMENTS PROVIDE A MODEL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE MODEL USED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FOR EXAMPLE AS I RECALL AND YOU ALL WELL KNOW THE LEGISLATURE WROTE RELIES UPON CENTRALIZED. HUMAN RESOURCES AND FACILITIES THROUGH THREE RULES COMMITTEE AND LEGAL SERVICES THEIR LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL. IN ORDER TO GAIN EFFICIENCIES AND CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE OFFICES. THE DEPARTMENT IS STRUCTURED MUCH THE SAME WAY. THIS YEAR'S PROGRAMS ARE PRIMARILY CHARGE PER RATHER. BASED ON THEIR STAFFING LEVELS SO ALL BOARDS AND AEROSPACE DEPARTMENT THE SAME DOLLAR AMOUNT TO PERFORM CENTRALIZED SERVICE FOR ANY GIVEN POSITION. THIS MODEL ASSUMES AVERAGES AND ALLOWS THE PROGRAMS TO PARTICIPATE IN DCA CENTRALIZED SERVICES. MUCH LIKE AN INSURANCE PROGRAM. LIKE INSURANCE PROGRAMS MEET MAY USE MORE OR LESS. GIVEN SERVICES IN A PARTICULAR YEAR AND ON AVERAGE THE SYSTEMS WORK TO EVERYONE'S BENEFIT. UNDER THIS MODEL COSTS ARE STABILIZED PROVIDING A PREDICTABLE BUDGET. ALLOWING THE BOARDS AND BUREAUS TO USE AS MUCH OF A SERVICE AS A NEED. WITHOUT CONCERNS ABOUT GOING OVER THEIR BUDGET. THERE ARE POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. PART OF ME THERE ARE POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF MOVING TO A USE MODEL. PROGRAMS MAY NOT SEEK SERVICE EVEN IF NEEDED. FOR EXAMPLE THE PROGRAM A PROGRAM YOU CHOOSE NOT TO PUSH A REGULATION PACKAGE BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE DIRECTLY CHARGE FOR LEGAL SERVICES WHEN WE TRY TO HANDLE SENSES SENSITIVE PERSONNEL ACTIONS. WITHOUT HUMAN RESOURCES EXPERTISE. WITHOUT EXPERTISE TO ADVISE ON THESE ISSUES PROGRAMS WOULD BE EXPOSED TO POTENTIAL LIABILITY LIABILITY. AND LARGER COSTS IN THE LONG RUN. AS MENTIONED IN THE BACKGROUNDPAPER. THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM IN PLACE. TO TRACK INDIVIDUAL STAFF TIME SPENT ON SPECIFIC PROGRAMS. IMPLEMENTING SUCH A PROGRAM COULD BE EXTREMELY COSTLY. AND IT WOULD BE A NEW IT SYSTEM AT THE AME TIME WE'RE TRYING TO ROLL OUT THE DEPARTMENT'S BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PLAN. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. AS I NOTED EARLIER WE'VE STARTED A PRO RATA WORKGROUP WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PROGRAMS TO DISCUSS CONCERNS. RESOURCES AN IMPROVEMENT TO SERVICES. DOCUMENTING CERTAIN PROCESSES AND EXPECTED TIME FRAMES MAY ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY. I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK TO ENHANCE THE SERVICES THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES. THE BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF THE BOARDS AND GROSS. NEXT I WILL DRESS ISSUE NUMBER TWO. OF THE BACKGROUND PAPER AND DISCUSS THE LEGAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT PROVIDES TO OUR PROGRAMS. DO YOU SEE AS LONG SERVING GENERAL COUNSEL. RECENTLY RETIRED AFTER MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS. AND THE LEGAL AFFAIRS DIVISION HAS A NEW DEPUTY DIRECTOR DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND NEW MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE TO BUILD UPON PREVIOUS SUCCESSES. THE DIVISION'S NEW MANAGEMENT IS COMMITTED TO SEEKING OUT AN INPUT IN IMPLEMENTING IMPROVEMENTS WHERE NEEDED. ONE AREA FOR IMPROVEMENT THAT THE COMMITTEE IS IDENTIFIED WITH THE TIMELINESS OF ADVICE ON PERSONNEL MATTERS. THE LEGAL AFFAIRS DIVISION PROVIDES ADVICE REGARDING LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT MATTERS TO DCA CENTRALIZED SERVICES AND TO ITS PROGRAMS. ATTORNEYS DRAFT EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS AND PROVIDE ADVICE ON DISCIPLINE MATTERS. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS WORKPLACE VIOLENCE HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS AND WORKERS COMPENSATION. TO ADDRESS TIMELINESS CONCERNS. LEGAL DIVISION IS CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN A LEAN SIX SIGMA BUSINESS PROCESS REVIEW. OFFERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. TO STREAMLINE AND IMPROVE THE HANDLING OF ADVERSE PERSONNEL ACTIONS. THE ULTIMATE GOAL WOULD BE TO APPLY THESE EFFICIENCIES TO ALL PERSONNEL MATTERS. WELL I UNDERSTAND OF THE COMMITTEES ARE INTERESTED IN THE ABILITY OF SOME BOARDS TO HIRE THEIR OWN IN HOUSE ATTORNEY. IT IS THE DEPARTMENT'S POSITION THAT ALL OF ITS CLIENTS SPORTS EMBRYOS ARE BEST SERVED. USING THE TRADITIONAL MODEL OF CENTRALIZED CENTRALIZED LEGAL SERVICES. ATTORNEYS EMPLOYED BY THE DEPARTMENT'S LEGAL AFFAIRS DIVISION ARE SIR ARE SIGNED TO SERVE HAS IN HOUSE LEGAL COUNSEL TO DEPARTMENTS BOARDS AND BUREAUS. HAVE AN ATTORNEY CLIENT RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR BORDER. BUT THEY ALSO WORK IN A COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY CAN DRAWN LEGAL KNOWLEDGE AND PRIOR EXPERIENCE OF OTHER ATTORNEYS WITHIN DEPARTMENT. ALLOWING FOR CONTINUITY CONTINUITY WHEN THERE'S A TURNOVER IN BASE KNOWLEDGE OF ONGOING ISSUES LIKE THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE NORTH CAROLINA. NORTH CAROLINA CASE. ADDITIONALLY. UNLIKE THE WORK OF A LOAN PROGRAM ATTORNEY. THE WORK OF LEGAL AFFAIRS DIVISION ATTORNEYS IS SUPERVISED BY ASSISTANT CHIEF COUNSELS AND OTHER SENIOR ATTORNEYS. ENSURING ACCURACY CONSISTENCY AND THE QUALITY OF THE LEAGUE OF AND THE QUALITY OF THE LEGAL ADVICE. AND BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT HAS MULTIPLE ATTORNEYS ON STAFF. THE LEGAL AFFAIRS DIVISION CAN PROBABLY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ATTORNEY RESOURCES WHEN NEEDED. SUCH AS A SISTER ASSIGN MULTIPLE ATTORNEYS TO ONE CLIENT. PROVIDING MEETING COVERAGE IN THE EVENT OF AN ENEMY UNEXPECTED ATTORNEY ABSENCE. FINALLY LIKE TO DISCUSS THE THIRD ISSUE IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER RELATED TO THE REGULATORY REVIEW PROCESS. OF THE DEPARTMENT. AS A NEW DIRECTOR AT THE DEPARTMENT. THE FLOW AND QUALITY OF REGULATIONS IS SOMETHING I QUICKLY IDENTIFIED. AS A SUBJECT OF IMPORTANT BOTH TO THE PROGRAMS HAD TO THE HEAD TO CONSUMERS AT LARGE. THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO CONSULT WITH THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. TO IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES IN OUR REVIEW PROCESS. WE CURRENTLY PARTNER WITH THEM THROUGHOUT THE YEAR TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S INTERNAL TRAININGS FOR PROGRAM STAFF. AND ALWAYS APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK AN IMPORTANT INFORMATION WE RECEIVE. CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT HAVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES FORTS REVIEW PROCESS BUT THIS IS ONE OF OUR STRATEGIC PLAN GOALS. AS PART OF PROCESS TO ESTABLISH REASONABLE AND EFFECTIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES. THE DEPARTMENT. IS SPEARHEADING A NEW REGULATION TRACKING SYSTEM. THAT WILL INTEGRATE EACH OF THE DEPARTMENT'S KEY REVIEW AREA IS INTO ONE SYSTEM. THIS WILL ENABLE THE DEPARTMENT AND PROGRAMS TO QUICKLY DETERMINE THE STATUS OF A REGULATION. AND TO DEVELOP BENCH MARKS FOR REVIEW DURING EACH STAGE OF THE REVIEW PROCESS. NOT ONLY WILL IT HOLD UP THE DEPARTMENT ACCOUNTABLE FOR IT FOR REVIEW TIME LINES. BUT WILL PROVIDE GREATER TRANSPARENCY TO THE BOARDS AND GROWS AWAITING FEEDBACK FROM THE APARTMENT DURING THIS PROCESS. THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE HAPPY TO REPORT BACK ON THIS ITEM. NEXT. ON THIS ITEM NEXT YEAR DURING THE SUNSET PROCESS. WELL I BELIEVE THAT. REASONABLE TIMELINES AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED. I'M ALSO CONCERNED WITH THE QUALITY OF REGULATIONS. THE DEPARTMENT'S PROGRAMS HISTORICALLY HAVE AT A HIGH PROPORTION OF REGULATION PACKAGE PACKAGES REJECTED BY THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. SO WHILE THE REVIEW TIME LINE LEVELS OF REVIEW ARE NECESSARY TO MEET THE STANDARD OF LAW. I ALSO AGREE THAT ONGOING TRAINING IS CRITICAL TO ANY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS PROCESS. IN ADDITION TO TRAINING THAT. IN ADDITION TO THE TRAIN AT DEPARTMENT OF RIDES TO THE PROGRAM STAFF ON THE REGULATORY PROCESS. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO ENCOURAGES AND PROMOTES THOSE STAFF INVOLVED IN THE REVIEW IN THE REVIEW PROCESS. TO ATTEND THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE FLAWS THREE DAY TRAINING. THIS IS SOMETHING WE WILL CONTINUE TO D AS WE REFINE AND IMPROVE OUR OWN STANDARDS AND PROCESS HE'S. IN CLOSING I BRIEFLY SHARE A FEW OF THE WORDS I STATED DURING MY SENATE RULES COMMITTEE HEARING FOR CONFIRMATION A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. I THINK ALL OF US WOULD AGREE. THAT CALIFORNIA IS THE GREATEST STATE IN THE NATION IN PART BECAUSE OF HOW BOLD YOU FOR THINKING WE CRAFT OUR PUBLIC POLICIES. I LOOK FORWARD TO PORT BARGAINING WITH ALL OF YOU AS WE SHAPE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE FROM. THANK YOU MISTER DIRECTOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THAT SENATOR DODD. SENATOR PAY AND I HAD TO LEAVE THE WANTED ME TO ASK QUESTION THAT I'VE GOT ANOTHER ONE MYSELF BUT THAT. HE WAS FOCUSING ON. STAFFING HE'D NOTICED THAT. IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN WE COME HERE THAT'S A COMMENT. CONCERN WITH THE THE THE THE BUREAU'S ON. THE STAFFING BUT MAYBE NOT. AS HE'S ASKED QUESTIONS. WAS IS THEIR BUDGET REQUESTS YET AND THE ANSWER IS NO ARE YOU. WORKING ON YOUR SOME SORT OF PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. THE STAFFING DOES GET. ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED IN THE BUDGET PROCESS. SO. YES AND NO YES IN THE SENSE THAT WE'RE ALWAYS OPEN MINDED IN TERMS OF HOW TO ADDRESS. STAFFING NEEDS FOR ALL OUR PROGRAMS. NO IN THE SENSE THAT. NOT EVERY STAFF INITIALLY REQUIRES A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. SO I'M VERY OPEN MINDED IN TERMS OF HOW TO DIRECTLY AND EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS STOPPING CONCERNS I'M I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT WORKS VERY CLOSELY. WITH OUR PROGRAMS WHEN IN FACT A STAFFING ISSUE. DOES COME TO OUR ATTENTION. AND YES THANK YOU AND. YOU ON ON THE ISSUE WITH THE. THE. THE B. ALREADY BECOMING AN APARTMENT YOU KNOW THAT WAS A BILL THAT I RAN LAST YEAR AND. I KNOW THAT YOU'RE. YOU KNOW YOU. YOU CAME IN AFTER THE. YOU KNOW ALL THIS STUFF WAS HAPPY BUT I GUESS I'VE GOT IT. RESPONDED. THERE'S A FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR DELTA BETWEEN. WHAT YOU WERE CHARGING? THE BUREAU AND NOW. EVEN WITH THEM GONE THERE'S THERE'S YOU'RE STILL GOT THAT FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS BURIED SOMEWHERE. YET AND I ARE ONE I DON'T MEAN TO SAY BERRY BUT IS EVE GOT IT IN THE BUDGET. THE BOARD IN. IT I GUESS THAT'S CONCERNING TO ME. YOU'RE FOR FOR OBVIOUS REASONS I WONDER IF YOU COULD JUST COMMENT ON YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS AND. IN MOVING DOWN THE ROAD IN THIS REGARD. ANY. PROGRAM THAT LEAVES THE DEPARTMENT IS IT'S CONCERNING. TO ME TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE ARE YOU LEAVING. OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE MINIMAL IMPACT ON EXISTING PROGRAMS ARM IN THE SHORT TERM AND THE DELTA THAT YOU MENTIONED. WHILE. HAS YET TO BE YOU KNOW COMPLETELY DECIDED HOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS. I STATED. MY SORT OF MY POINT. THE APPROXIMATE FIVE MILLION. YOU KNOW HIT TO THE DEPARTMENT. IS A ARGUABLY LARGE SIGNIFICANT A FACTOR FOR ALL PROGRAMS AND SO. AGAIN. TRYING TO DETERMINE SPECIFICALLY HOW TO ADDRESS THAT. NOT ONLY IN THE NEAR TERM BUT MAY BE OVER. YOU KNOW THE MID TERM. ULTIMATELY I'M INTERESTED IN TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THE REMAINING PROGRAMS ARE. OR NOT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE DEPARTURE OF OF THE ARMY. BUSH. THIS COULD BE WHAT WHAT WHAT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I BEAT IT'S IT'S IT'S SOME MORE IT IS TROUBLING TO ME BECAUSE SOME MORE IT SEEMS THAT THERE SEE YELL A STRUCTURAL. ISSUE WITH REGARD TO STAFFING. YEAH WITHIN THE DCA. I THINK THIS IS EVIDENCE. OF THAT AND SO I GUESS. IT IT IS PRETTY HARD IT. HE OUT. THEY HAVE YOU REACT YET TODAY BUT THIS IS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO COME UP. YOU KNOW EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT WE HAVE A REVIEW ON IT OUT YOU KNOW IN THIS AGENCY SO MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE. TO ME THIS IS TOO LARGE OF A DELTA JUST TO GO UNNOTICED AND NOT HAVE US. RESPOND TO. TO ME IT'S A BIG DEAL AND I DON'T SEE HOW OTHER DEPARTMENTS ARE GOING TO BE. GIVEN THIS. PROGRAM AT. YEAH EXTRA SHARE GIVE IT TO THEM AND WHEN THE RULES AND REGULATIONS ARE SUCH THAT. THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE PAYING FOR ANYBODY ELSE'S. SERVICES. I I KNOW YOUR IN THE ALLEY. SUGGESTED THAT. THE YOU THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE LA O. SUGGESTED TO YOU REVISIT PRO RATA CHARGES. AND SO I I I. I I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU EXCEPT FOR THIS IS GOOD EVERY TIME THIS COMES UP I'VE GOT TO BE ASKING THESE QUESTIONS. NOT. NOT LOST ON SOME LOST ON ME ARE WHAT TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING TO TO TO ME. TODAY. SPECIFIC TO AGAIN YOUR LEGISLATION. IN MY REVIEW OF IT. I THINK THE KIND OF A LONG TERM. POTENTIAL OF THE IMPACT. ON THE DEPARTMENT AND ITS PROGRAMS. COULD HAVE BEEN FURTHER I GUESS CONSIDERED VETTED EXCEPT TRUCK. WE ARE NOW OBVIOUSLY. IN CHARGE OF IMPLEMENTING YOUR LEGISLATION AND HOW OBVIOUSLY ADAM IMPACTS. THE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER PROGRAMS. COMPLETELY COMPLETELY RECOGNIZE THAT. THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT SPECIFIC TO. PRO RATA. L. A. O.'S RECOMMENDATION. I'M. WHAT ARGUMENT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED? BUT I THINK IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN TOTALITY OF HOW HE PER USAGE APPROACH. COULD HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE NEGATIVE IMPACT IMPACT ON THE SMALLER PROGRAMS AT DCA. PART OF MY REFERENCE TO PREVIOUS WORK THAT I HAVE DONEBEFORE. I KNOW IT MAY SOUND KIND OF. YOU KNOW ROMANTIC AN INJURY TO ONE IS AN INJURY AT ALL HAS A SMALLER PROGRAM. CONSIDERATION SHOULD ALSO BE. YOU DON'T. CLEAN THOUGHTFULLY CONSIDERED WHEN. WE ARE DISCUSSING THE POTENTIAL TO GOING TO A PER USE MODEL. THEIR ARMS. I'M NOT BE IN. THERE TOO OUR ARGUMENT IS MR FEEL ABOUT IT I DIDN'T ND I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU ON THIS ON THE ON THE SMALLER PROGRAMS. BUT. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT ON THE SMALLER PROGRAMS. IF THEY'RE NOT PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. OR THEIR FAIR SHARE WOULD BE SUCH A GREAT. NEGATIVE IMPACT. YOU KNOW ON ON THEIR SPECIFIC PROGRAM PERHAPS WE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT. BUT UNDER A DIFFERENT LIGHT THEM WERE LOOKING OUT. AT AT AT THESE FEES YELLOW ARE A MORE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOUR MACRO YELL LEVEL. AND CERTAINLY THE OF THE THE DEPARTMENT REAL STUDENTS STAY GOING. THE STATE GOING BACK TO THE BARBER REAL ESTATE WAS A DIRECT FUNCTION OF YOUR PREDECESSORS NOT YOU. THAT HAD JUST IGNORED THIS PROCESS OVER TIME AND I WOULD SUGGEST TO YOU THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY VERY. IMPORTANT TO THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE GET A HANDLE ON. COMPLETELY AGREE AND IN NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM. DIRECTED I EAT BY MY RESPONSES TO SUGGEST ANY KIND OF. ARGUMENT. QUITE QUITE CHERRY. ELEVEN MONTHS THAT I HAVE BEEN AT THE DEPARTMENT. PRO RATA IS ABSOLUTELY AN ISSUE THAT HAS COME TO MY CONTENTION COME TO MY ATTENTION OFTEN END EARLY AND OFTEN AND AS I MENTIONED IN MY COMMENTS. TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS COMPLETE TRANSPARENCIES A SPECIFIC TO PRO RATA TO OUR PROGRAMS. I'LL BE THE FIRST AND I THINK OTHERS HAVE HEARD ME SAY THAT I IN NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM HAVE A MONOPOLY ON GOOD IDEAS. AND I AND I WELCOME. DIRECT COLLABORATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE WITH YOU OTHERS TO. ADDRESS THE ISSUE. I THINK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS OF. WELL YOU KNOW. MR DIRECTOR IN AND THANK YOU SENATOR DOT FOR THOSE THOSE QUESTIONS AND THE CONCERN BECAUSE IT IS IT IS AN ISSUE THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE. THE CHARGING AND THE FACT THAT. IT'S GEORGE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED BOARD PERSONNEL RATHER THAN ON THE ACTUAL COST OF THOSE BOARDS AND AND I I FRANKLYI I DISAGREE WITH THE ARGUMENT I THINK IT'S THE FACT THAT. THAT THERE IS A. YOU KNOW CREATED A COMPUTER SYSTEM OR A CHARGE SYSTEM THAT WOULD ALLOCATE THOSE. THOSE CHARGES TO THOSE PARTICULAR BOARD SHAPIRO'S BASED ON THEIR USAGE. IS A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT WAY OF DOING IT IT REQUIRES CERTAIN CERTAINLY. HE THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO TO CONSERVE FOR THE ABILITY TO FOR THEM TO BECOME MORE EFFICIENT IN THE PROCESS AND THERE'S NO INCENTIVE TODAY. FOR ANYONE TO NOT USE WHATEVER SERVICES THEY WANTED IS CALLED THE CA FOR WHATEVER BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE SOMEBODY THERE TO HELP. THEM AND I THINK THAT'S NOT THE WAY CERTAINLY IT SHOULD BE A AND I FIND THAT IT'S JUST THE FACT THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE A COMPUTER SYSTEM BUT NOW YOU'RE WORKING ON A NEW IT SYSTEM FOR. THE TRACK REGULATIONS MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE A NEW IT SYSTEM TO WORK ON THE PROKHOROVKA CHARGES AND AND ALLOCATE THEM APPROPRIATELY TO THESE. THESE DIFFERENT BOARDS AND AND BUREAUS IT'S THAT IT LACKS EFFICIENCY AND AND AS I SAID AND. AND THE CONSISTENCY OF IT WHICH IS. I THINK. IMPORTANT END OF IT IN THE IDEA OF OF. OF REQUIRING THEM AND AND I THINK SENATOR DODD'S CONCERNS RELATED TO. THE FEAR OF REAL ESTATE AND NOW THE DEPARTMENT IS IS IS CRITICAL TO THE HIGH COST AND THE AND THAT LEADS ME INTO THE OTHER WITH PART WHICH IS RELATED TO THE LEGAL COUNSEL. YOU KNOW THIS SOME OF THESE WERE THE BOARDS HAVE REQUIRED AND ASK FOR. OUTSIDE COUNSEL THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS IT UTILIZES IT VERY EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY. AND THEY'RE STILL PAYING THEIR PARODIC CHARGES FOR FOR THAT USE IN IN THEIR THEIR COSTS BUT THEY NEEDED THOSE THAN THE GENERAL BOARD I KNOW HAD THAT REQUEST. IN WE'VE AUTHORIZED THAT ARE ALLOWED THAT TO TO OCCUR IN DATE IT'D BEEN DENIED BY DCA. WE WANT TO SEE THE BOARDS IN BUREAUS. ACTED AND WORK RESPONSIBLY EFFICIENTLY. CAN ALLOW THEM THE AUTONOMY IN SOME CASES TO DO THAT AS THEY DESIRE. IN THIS CASE IT WAS DENIED AND CONTINUE TO BE DENIED I TALK WITH THE. OTHER SIX SECRETARY PROTEST ON THE ISSUE AND SHE SAID WE'RE JUST GOING TO DISAGREE DECEPTIVE. IT IS A GREAT WELL I MEAN THAT'S. THAT SEEMS TO BE A. ROACH THAT IS A. IS IS NOT THE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE I THINK AND. I THINK IF WE WANT TO SEE SOME GOOD CONSUMER PROTECTION AND APPROPRIATE END AND QUICK RESPONSIVENESS. I MEAN THE DELAYS NOW WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF INVESTIGATIONS AS YOU KNOW WHAT THREE YEARS. TWO YEARS THREE YEARS FOUR YEARS IN SOME CASES. I MEAN THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THAT THE CONSUMER BUT THE A I BELIEVE IT'S JUST AS MUCH BUSINESS AS USUAL WITH THE DCA. AND WE'LL JUST EXPECTED AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS WELL THAT'S JUST IN LIKE A BUREAUCRATIC ANSWER. AND NOT AN EFFECTIVE EFFICIENT GOOD GOVERNMENT ANSWER I THINK WE HAVE THE SENSE THAT REVIEWS EVERY FOUR YEARS AND END WITH THE DC AID. IN THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST THINGS GOVERNMENT DOES. IS WE REQUIRE THAT ALL OF THE BOARD AND FEARS THE FORTY ONE OR HOWEVER MANY OR UNDER YOU AS CLOSE TO THAT. THEY HAVE TO RESPOND AND BE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND TO JUSTIFY THEIR CONTINUED EXISTENCE. AND IF WE CAN'T DO THAT AND REQUIRE THE SPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE AS SENATOR DOES MENTION WITHIN THE. THE THE DCA THE YOU KNOW THE L. A. O. SUGGESTS THE LEGISLATURE COMPEL BC TO REVISIT PRO RATA CHARGES. ASKING COMPEL. AND WE ARE WE IT JUST AS WE ASK FOR THE ATTORNEYS IN THOSE OTHER AREAS AND ENOUGH TO KNOW. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A GOOD ACCEPTABLE RESPONSE THAT WE HAVE TO. OR DO WE HAVE TO ACCEPT IN A WAY THAT THAT I THINK PUTS UNDUE BURDEN ON SOME OF THOSE BOARDS WITHIN DCA THAT WE ALL EXPECT. AND REQUIRE THEM TO DO AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SO I HOPE YOU WILL LOOK AT THAT. THAT ISSUE A LITTLE MORE CLEARLY AND TO ME. WHAT I LOOK AT THE FRANKLIN I THIS IS AT THE THE PRO RATA CHARGES HAVE BECOME A CASH COW FOR DCA? AND IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE THAT WAY UNTIL SOMETHING IS DONE ABOUT IT EITHER THE LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE HAS TO DO SOMETHING. OR DCA TAKES IT UPON THEMSELVES TO TO TO LOOK AT IT AND AND FIND A BETTER WAY. TO ALLOCATE THOSE FUNDS. LEADS THE PART OF THAT IN THE OTHER. SOME QUESTIONS I DID HAVE ONE IS THE DEPARTMENT APPEARS. TO REQUIRE A NUMBER OF MANDATORY CONSULTATIONS OR REVIEW BY. BY DEPARTMENT STAFF IS THERE ANY. CLEAR UNDERSTANDING AS TO. UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES THESE CONSULTATIONS OR. ARE A OUR RECORD REVIEWS ARE NECESSARY JOURNEY CRITERIA ESTABLISHED FOR STANDARDS ARE THE WRITTEN POLICIES OR PROCEDURES WHEN WHEN THESE CONSULTATIONS ARE REVIEWS ARE. ARE ARE NECESSARY. AS IT IS TO. HAPPEN THAT. FOR CHANGE. NOT CLEAR TO ME WHICH CONSULTATION OR VIEWS REFERRING TO. GENTLY SPEAKING WE TRY TO ENSURE THAT. YOU KNOW IF PROGRAMS NEED ASSISTANCE WE TRY TO MAKE IT AS PRODUCTIVE AS POSSIBLE AND MAYBE THERE ARE SOME AN UP FRONT. AREA THAT. WOULD BE NEEDED IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A YOU KNOW PRODUCTIVE HITTER OF OUR PROCESS BUT. I'M NOT AGAIN NOT LOSE THE GENDERS IN THE AGENDAS IN THE MEETINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED AND OTHER THINGS THAT. HAVE TO GO THROUGH DC EIGHT. IN IN IN WE WE DID THAT LETTER THAT THAT WE HAD SENT. ON JANUARY SEVENTEENTH THAT WAS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS THAT IT HASN'T HAVEN'T RECEIVED A RESPONSE YET. TO THAT. CORRECT AND. HER INITIAL DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAD HAD WITH. STAFF. WE KNOW THAT. WITH WHAT'S PROBABLY FIRST. PROTECTED BY THE FIRST STEP IN ORDER TO ENSURE A PRODUCTIVE IN OUR PROCESS. THAT WE SIT DOWN AND HAVE A HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT KIND OF THE TOTALITY. OF OF YOU KNOW EITHER IN THAT SPECIFIC. MEMO OR PREVIOUS. MMHM REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION. FROM YOUR STAFF. AND AGAIN. I WELCOME THAT. IF YOUR PREFERENCE IS A. YOU KNOW BACK AND FORTH IN WRITTEN FORM. PLEASE PLEASE LET US KNOW THAT AS WELL. THE GOAL ULTIMATELY IS TO ENSURE THAT. THERE IS A. PRODUCTIVE COLLABORATIVE PROCESS. TOWARDS. I'M GETTING TO WHAT I THINK ARE IN FACT SHARED COMMON COMMON GOALS AND SHARED A COMMON AREAS OF INTEREST. SENATOR YOU'RE MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT. IMPROVEMENTS AND ACCOUNTABILITY EXCEPT TRY AND. YEAH MAYBE BECAUSE OF. MY ELEVEN MONTHS BEING AT THE DEPARTMENT I'M NOT ABLE TO. I GUESS IDEALLY AS QUICKLY. ACHIEVE. IMPROVEMENTS AND GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY. AS YOU AS YOU AS AS YOU MENTIONED BUT I CAN SAY IN THE LAST MONTH SAID THAT I HAVE BEEN YOU BENT HAVE BEEN THERE. THERE HAVE BEEN SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS RELATED TO TIME FOR A TIME FRAMES OF FOUR FOUR FOR REGULATIONS. THERE HAS BEEN IMPROVEMENTS SPECIFIC TO ADDRESS SEEN. OBSESSED STAFFING ISSUES. FOR FOREIGN FORCE MEANT AND SO. WHILE. WE HAVE YET TO BE. IDEAL IN PERFECT PERFECT ON MANY FRONTS I'M I'M CONFIDENT THAT. WE PUT OUR I PUT MY BEST FOOT PUT FORWARD TRY. TOWARD TRYING TO ACHIEVE WHAT IS IDEAL THAT IS DEMANDED FROM NOT ONLY YOURSELF BUT TECH CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. IN WHICH DIRECTION THE OTHER QUESTION JUST THE IN TERMS OF WHAT I MENTION INTER. RELATED TO CAN CONSULTATIONS AND REVIEWS THE DCA HAVE CONSISTENT. REFERRED DISAPPROVING STAFF REQUESTS WHICH IS YOU KNOW ANY ANY OF THE BCP'S THAT ARE. OUT THERE IS SEARCH CERTAIN. CRITERIA THAT YOU LOOK AT BEFORE THEY ARE APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED SPECIFIC TO THE CDD CBS. SO AS I UNDERSTAND AND I'M LEARNING. YOU KNOW. THE BCT PROCESS IS. ARGUABLY A. YEAH I JUST CLOSED. CONFIDENTIAL PROCESS IN TERMS OF DID YOU KNOW DETERMINING THE OUTCOME. WHAT I AM AWARE IS THAT I BELIEVE IT WAS TWENTY TWELVE WHEN THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE FIRST ISSUE CRITERIA SPECIFIC TO? YOU KNOW. BCP'S HAD I THINK ANNUALLY THEY HAVE REITERATED CRITERIA SPECIFIC TO VOTE FOR SPECIFIC TO BCP'S THAT ARE SUBMITTED BY EACH EACH EACH DEPARTMENT. DO. YOU USE THOSE CRITERIA OR DO HAVE THEIR OWN CRITERIA BASED ON WHAT YOUR NEEDS ARE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT DEFINITELY FACTORED IN HAPPY TO GET THAT. TO YOU A MAN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THIS NOTION OF. I GUESS A HARD AND FAST CRITERIA SPECIFIC TOO BCP'S AT THAT APARTMENT UTILIZES. DOESN'T NECESSARILY EXIST. AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY. NOT ALL CONCERNS PROBLEMS ISSUES. REQUIRE REQUIRE THE CP AND. THAT'S THAT THAT THAT IS A FACTOR THAT GOES INTO THE DECISION IF IF ONE IF A BOARD COMES TO YOU WITH THE BCP AND. AND IT'S. THEY THEY RAISE ISSUES THAT ARE OF CONCERN AND SHOWING WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS A NEED FOR THAT BCP OF THE PERSONNEL CHANGES. HOW DO YOU IF YOU DENY THAT OR PITCH TONIGHT HOW DO YOU WORK WITH THE BOARD? TOO ON WORKLOAD ISSUES BACKLOGS AND INSTALLATION OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES. IF THERE IS A DENIAL OF THOSE AND IF THEY REALIZE THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM. I THINK. IT INVOLVES. GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF HOW. THE YOU KNOW THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY. TRYING TO ACHIEVE ITS ITS DESIRED OUTCOMES ARM IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC. STAFFING LEVELS THAT NEED TO BE TO BE ADDRESSED THEIR NUMBER EXAMPLES IN MY ELEVEN MONTHS AT DCA WHERE. WE'VE ASSISTED WHO WITH FAT VIA ARMED DIVISION INVESTIGATION STAFF BEING HOUSED FOR LACK OF BETTER TERMS IN A SPECIFIC PROGRAM TO IMPROVE. THE ENFORCEMENT TIMELINES. SO IT'S. IT'S A CASE BY CASE BASIS AS YOU COULD IMAGINE. YOU KNOW. THE NEEDS OF ONE PROGRAM COULDN'T BACK AND COULD BE IN FACT DIFFERENT FROM ANOTHER AND. THE DEPARTMENT ALWAYS STRIVED TO BE NUMBER ON THAT REGARD TRYING TO ADDRESS OUR PROGRAM NEEDS. OKAY THEM. YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T IS THEN THE SYSTEM. OF A FINAL MY FINAL QUESTION. YOU CAN'T REALLY COMMENT AND I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO ON ANY PENDING INVESTIGATIONS BUT WHAT CAN YOU. TELL US. HOW THE DIVISION OF INVESTIGATION PRIORITIZES CASES THAT MAY HAVE? CRIMINAL END IN ADMINISTRATIVE VIOLATIONS TO AND WHAT I'M VERY CONCERNED WITH RIGHT NOW IS THAT THERE ARE NUMBER FRAUDULENT SCHOOLS. CLAIMING THEY ARE PROVIDING MASSAGE THERAPY OR COSMETOLOGY YOUR MANA CURING TRAINING. THAT ARE ACTUALLY JUST SELLING PROOF OF PROGRAM COMPLETION DOCUMENTS OR FALSIFYING DOCUMENTS FOR PEOPLE WHO NEVER RECEIVED THAT TRAINING IS THE. DEPARTMENT FOCUSED ON THESE ACTORS AND ON IN A TIMELY BASIS BECAUSE THOSE FRAUDULENT SCHOOLS THAT THAT LEAVES IT TO THEN THE. BUREAUS IN THE DEPARTMENTS IN THE BOOK I MEAN THE BOARDS TO. TO TRY TO IDENTIFY THEM THEMSELVES RATHER THAN HAVING INVESTIGATIONS ONGOING. SURE OF ANY BACKUP OF PER SE THAT. HER DIVISION INVESTIGATION. PER TWENTY TENDS. CONSUMER PROTECTION ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVE KINDA CATEGORIZES. HOW THE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF HOW DIVISION HAVE A DIVISION BECAUSE ABOUT ADDRESS SEEN? POTENTIAL ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. VIA THE CP I ACCEPTED GUIDELINES AGAIN THAT. ENSURES THAT IF IN FACT A PARTICULAR CASE REQUIRES. IMMEDIATE THAT THAT THAT THAT CASE GOES IMMEDIATELY TO THE DIVISION OF EDUCATION VERSUS. STAYING WITHIN. ITS SPECIFIC PROGRAM SO KIND OF ENFORCEMENT ACTION FROM BP. IN SO. TRYING TO. AT ME LEARNING THIS ISSUE TRYING TO IDENTIFY WAYS THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY I GUESS. GET AT THE ISSUE YOU KNOW FURTHER UPSTREAM AS OPPOSED TO A DOWNSTREAM. TO HEAL HARM. ANY DEFINED HARM IF SOMEONE TELLS YOU THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM OR THEY HAVE. A. FRAUDULENT FALSIFIED DOCUMENT THAT'S THE HARM YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. YEAH. TO YOUR POINT HARM IS GUESS IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER. I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH A SPECIFIC DEFINITION OF HARM THAT. HE MAY HAVE. AGAIN MY POINT IN MENTIONING THAT IS THAT I'M A STUDENT WOULD HAVE TO. GUESS AFFIRMATIVE AFFIRMATIVELY APPROACH JOB YOU KNOW PERHAPS BE BEAT BP. BEFORE BE PP YOU CAN ACT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU WE WILL NOW MOVE TO. THE BOARD OF VOCATIONAL NURSING AND PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS THAT DOES CONCLUDE THAT DEPARTMENT BUT. I KNOW YOU'LL STILL BE AROUND DIRECTOR FOR YOUR GOOD WORK WITH RELATED TO THIS BOARD TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. MOVING TO THE FIELD. IT WE WILL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT WHEN WE CONCLUDE WITH THE. ALL OF THE. HAS ADDRESSED BY THE DEPARTMENT TO. DO NOW LIKE TO INVITE THE. THOSE FROM THE BOARD PLEASE COME FORWARD. WORD OF OCCASIONAL NURSING AND PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS. SO. ONE. YEAH.

THE DEPARTMENT FOCUSED ITS INITIAL EFFORTS ON FIVE KEY ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENFORCEMENT AREAS OF THE BOARD. FIRST. I'M GOING VACANCY RATES STAFF WE CAN SEE RATES HAVE ALREADY DECLINED FROM NINETEEN PERCENT IN LATE DECEMBER ONLY THIRTY THIRTEEN PERCENT AS OF MARCH FIRST. BVB T.

LOOKING AT TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE DEPARTMENT STAFF CAN BE THE NPT LEADERSHIP WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE AREAS ALREADY HIGHLIGHTED. CONSUMING AND SOON BEGAN CONDUCTING A REVIEW OF THE LICENSING DIVISION TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT. NOW LET'S TURN OVER OVER THE MICROPHONE. OVER TO MR BEN FRANK. MISTER FRANK WAS SELECTED BY THE DEPARTMENT IN EARLY SIXTEEN TO SERVE AS THE ENFORCEMENT MONITOR FOR THE BOARD TO IDENTIFY ENFORCEMENT ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES. I DIDN'T. PREPARE ANY PREPARED COMMENTS ARE I DID REVIEW THE UP BACKGROUND PAPER PREPARED BY STAFF. OB BOG COMMITTEE STAFF AND I THINK IT DOES N OUTSTANDING JOB OF SUCCINCTLY SORT OF PRESENTING THE CHRONOLOGY OF WHAT. OCCURRED WITH THIS BOARD OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF PERCENT ONE PARTICULAR. THERE WERE. A NUMBER OF VERY SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAT SURFACED. IN OFF FROM A LATE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THROUGH MID TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. OF THOSE PROBLEMS WERE IDENTIFIED. AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND PARTICULARLY DIVISION OF INVESTIGATION. IN INTERVENING AT THE BOARD. AT THAT TIME WAS ABSOLUTELY INSTRUMENTAL IN PREVENTING. AUG THOSE PROBLEMS FROM WORSENING CONTAINING THOSE PROBLEMS. AND UNTIL A MORE SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE COULD BE PUT IN PLACE. YOU KNOW THAT. ARE BASICALLY JUST UNFORTUNATELY THERE WAS ABOUT A YEAR TO A YEAR AND A HALF OF TIME. THAT WAS KIND OF LOST IN TERMS OF. BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE. CONTINUE THE TURNAROUND THAT HAD BEEN BEGUN PREVIOUSLY AT THE BOARD AND AND FURTHER IMPROVE THE BOARD AND INSTEAD. THE EFFORTS WERE FOCUSED ON JUST CONTAINING THE PROBLEMS AND PREVENTING THEM FROM WORSENING. AT THAT TIME AND THAT INVOLVEMENT OF THE APARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS CONTINUED AT REALLY AN UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL IN MY EXPERIENCE. ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE END OF THE YEAR. AND THEN REALLY STEPPED U TO A NEW LEVEL AT THE BEGINNING OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TWO MONTHS AGO. PENDING WITH THE APPOINTMENT OF A. THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER. OF WHO HAD BEEN THE ART DEPARTMENTS CONTRACT OPERA A PROJECT MANAGER FOR THE ENFORCEMENT PROJECT FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS. AS THE BOARD'S EXECUTIVE OFFICER. AND THEN. THE APPOINTMENT THE BEGINNING OF THE OCCUPYING MEANT STARTED OF WORK WITH THE NEW EXECUTIVE OFFICER ON JANUARY TWENTY SECOND. THE ACCELERATED HIRING. OF. AS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED ABOVE I KNEW A LOT OF THE FIRST. PERMANENT ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE OFFICER IN THREE YEARS. AND OTHER CHANGES IN THE MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION AND REALLY. ACCELERATE YOU KNOW ARE JUMPING IN TO PICK UP AND. BEGIN IMPLEMENTING ALL OF THE NEEDED CHANGES OR IMPROVEMENTS THAT WERE NEEDED. WITH ORGANIZATION WITH STAFFING. AND WHAT PROCESSES. AUG CONCURRENTLY THE DIVISION OF INVESTIGATION. AGAIN WITH THE SUPPORT OF DJS LEADERSHIP TEAM AND IT'S FAIRLY BROAD BASED I CAN TELL YOU UP. IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET OFFICE LEDGE OFFERS US. OFF. HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICE OFFICE OF INFORMATION SERVICES AND THE DIVISION OF INVESTIGATION IT'S IT'S KIND OF. ACROSS THE BOARD AT DCA. TRYING TO DO ALL OF THE THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED TO BE NEED TO BE DONE AND NEED TO BE DONE. AND CAN BE DONE NOW. TO ADDRESS THIS BOARD PROBLEMS. AND. THAT HAS CONTINUED. AND IN A VERY INTENSIVE WAY FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS THE ARE AGAIN THE. THE ACTING EXECUTIVE OFFICER KIND OF DROPPED IN MORE TO THE CAPACITY OF A AN ACTING ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE OFFICER PENDING THE APPOINTMENT OF THE PERMANENT. ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE OFFICER WHICH BEGAN I GUESS LAST WEEK. AND ARE THE. ARE THAT INVOLVEMENT CONTINUES THE DEPARTMENT THE DIVISION INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVEMENT CONTINUES WITH THE VERY INTENSE INVOLVEMENT OF SEVERAL STAFF FROM THE DIVISION OF INVESTIGATION. ON A ON A ON A SUSTAINED BASIS. IN ORDER FOR THE IMPORT WITH pMANAGING AND TURNING AROUND ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM. I'LL BE MEETING AGAIN TOMORROW. OUGHT TO HELP ON BOARD THE NEW ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE OFFICER. AND SO THAT PROCESS IS CONTINUING. AND I HAVE. I THINK THERE IS GREAT READ FROM FROM MY OBSERVATIONS IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS I THINK THERE'S GREAT CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM. AT THIS POINT THAT THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO LOOK BACK ON THIS AND SEE. THAT THE CHANGES THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED AS RESULT OF ENACTMENT OF A B. TWELVE TWENTY NINE. ARE ARE ARE ARE HAVING A MEANINGFUL AND LASTING. UP BENEFIT. OFF THE HIGH IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THIS PROGRAM'S LONG STANDING PROBLEMS. THANK YOU MISTER FRANKEN AND THAT WAS THE QUESTION I WAS GOING TO SK YOU HAVE YOU OVER ON THE RIGHT TRACK ARE WE GOING TO. ABLE TO TO MAKE THE CHANGES THAT THAT WE ALL FELT NECESSARY LAST YEAR AND. IT SOUNDS LIKE WE ARE I'VE I HOPE SO. GOODNIGHT FOR THAT'S GOOD GOOD GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER DIRECTOR DID YOU HAVE SOMEONE ELSE THAT YOU WANTED TO. SOME PROVISIONS STATEMENTS. OKAY THEN WE WILL OTHER QUESTIONS ARE. COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. NO ONE HAD ONE QUESTION JUST A. IT I AND I GUESS THE KEY IS IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO. AS A LEGISLATURE TO MAKE ESPECIALLY MICHELLE GOOD JUNIOR. CONCERNS NOW IS. AS THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF TRAINING THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP YOU AND ASSIST YOU I'VE IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE I KNOW AND. AND A LOT OF THE BOARD IS COME TOGETHER AND HELP TO MAKE THAT CHANGE AND SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT YOU. HAVE THAT YOU THINK WE CAN DO. THANK YOU SIR. I CAN I CAN GET TO THAT I I HAD A FEW PHONE IS VERY GOOD THANK YOU. MISTER MISTER CHAIR MISTER CHURCHILL TO YOUR LOVE. MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY PROVIDE THE UPDATES. ON THE STATUS OF BV IN PT I'M LAYING OUT YOUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AS OF JANUARY TWENTY SECOND. I WANT TO SHARE SOME OF OUR ADMINISTER PROGRESS REGARDING HIRING A KEY POSITIONS BUILDING A BETTER CULTURE. IMPROVING COMMUNICATIONS AND STRENGTHENING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WITH ME OF COURSE IS OUR NEWLY REELECTED PRESIDENT TENIENDO SO. WHO WILL PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION ON HOW WE'RE ADDRESSING THAT FORCED HIM ON HIS RECOMMENDATION? AND ARE ALSO NEWLY REELECTED VICE PRESIDENT BRINGS BASTIDE MARTINEZ WHOSE GREATEST SHARE SOME MORE PROGRESS IN OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING. BUT FIRST I I HOPE YOU'LL INDULGE ME BECAUSE. I DO WISH TO EXPRESS MY GREAT GRATITUDE TO MISTER BROPHY LOW AND THE DEPARTMENT AND CLUED IN THE. DIVISION OF INSTIGATION IS FOR. UNSTINTING. AND I USE THAT WORD ADVISEDLY UNSTINTING SUPPORT. TO US IN THIS TIME OF TRANSITION I'M ESPECIALLY GRATEFUL TO MISTER BRIAN CLIFFORD OF DCA. MISS STEPHANIE WHITLEY FROM DIVIDE. WHO HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY FOR MONTHS? TO LAY A FOUNDATION FOR THE BOOK AT THE BOARD TO BUILD FROM. ANTECHAMBER. VERY GOOD COUNSEL VERY VERY SLOW. ON POINT LET'S SAY INSIGHTS FREE AS I AM ACCLIMATING AND I KNOW THAT THEY WILL DO THE SAME FOR. OUR NEW ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE OFFICER. AND ON THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT WHEN I WALKED INTO THE OFFICE ON JANUARY TWENTY SECOND. I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I FOUND THERE. WAS A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE WHO LIKE WHAT THEY DO AND ARE PROUD TO SERVE CALIFORNIA. AND WE CAN ABSOLUTELY BUILD FROM THAT. WHEN I BEGAN THERE WAS STILL QUITE AN ALONG VACANCY REPORT. AND I'M PLEASED TO SAY. THERE ARE MANY THERE ARE SO MANY MORE FIELD DESKS AT THE BOARD NOW PEOPLE LIKE COMING TO WORK. WE HAVE HIGHER AS WE HAVE SAID WE ORGANISE I NOR REORGANIZING YET TO DO. BY DAY I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE VERY FIRMLY ON THE RIGHT PATH AND I THINK A LAWYER FOR. ENDORSING THAT IDEA TO. BUT I AM VERY VERY HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE'VE HIRED. I SUPPOSE I THINK A SUPERBLY QUALIFIED THIS IS AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER. WITH LIMA START ON MARCH FIRST THIS IS DAY THREE SHE'S ALREADY MAKING A DIFFERENCE. SHE BRINGS AS MANY EXPERIENCES IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN LICENSING PRETTY MUCH EVERY PHASE OF LICENSING. CHANGE MANAGEMENT AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS WE HAVE A PERMANENT SENIOR MANAGEMENT AT THE BOARD. WE'RE BOTH EXTREMELY COMMITTED. FIRMLY COMMITTED TO PROVIDING A SUPPORTIVE SAFE AND PRODUCTIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT. BUT I THINK PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGE SO FAR IS IN COMMUNICATIONS. THIS STUFF ALREADY KNOWS AND FEELS COMFORTABLE WITH THEIR EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE RADIO. I THINK THINGS AS SIMPLE AS EMAILING THEM UPDATES ARE CONTINUING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I'M IN THE PROCESS OF HAVING ONE ON ONE MEETINGS WITH EVERY SINGLE STAFF MEMBER. VICKI'S FIRST WEEK HAS INCLUDED ON IS INCLUDING. A MEANS OF THESE TEAMS ARMED WITH A WHOLE LOT OF COOKIES. AND I KNOW THAT MANAGERS ARE HAVING. TEAM MEETINGS REGULARLY AND ONE ON ONES WITH THEIR TEAMS. NEXT UP WILL INCLUDE A REGULAR UPDATES THROUGH SOMETHING THAT. KIND OF RESEMBLES A NEWSLETTER. WE'RE LOOKING TO HAVE MONTHLY BROWN BAGS I THINK SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW THE OUR TEAM IS DIVIDED. IN THREE SEPARATE LOCATIONS ARE BUILDING WHICH. I THINK IS PROBLEMATIC FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND MORALE. SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE COMMUNICATIONS TO THEM WE'RE GONNA GO IN AND SIT IN THEIR OFFICES. JALAPENO WITH LUNCH PEOPLE COULD COME AND. JUST CHAT THEY CAN ASK QUESTIONS OR JUST HANG OUT. WILL BE LAUNCHING. AN EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT SURVEY MOST LIKELY THIS MONTH WHICH WILL REPEAT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. WITH SOME FINE TUNING BASED ON WHAT WE FIND IS. KEY ISSUES THAT THEY'RE IDENTIFIED BY THE SURVEY. AND I WANT TO SAY THE COMMUNICATIONS OF THE BOARD IS EVERY BIT AS IMPORTANT. OUR BOARD MEMBERS REPRESENT THE PROFESSIONALS WE SERVE. AND OF COURSE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEIR EXPERTISE IS ESSENTIAL IN ACHIEVING OUR MISSION. MY GOAL IS TO CONTINUE IMPROVING THAT INCLUSION OF THAT EXPERTISE AND INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY EFFECTIVENESS. OF OUR TIME THAT WE SPEND WITH THEM. IN TERMS OF COMEDIAN BOARD MEETINGS WE'RE GOING TO START BY IMPROVING OUR PREPARATION. FOR MEETINGS. AND IF BY ENHANCING THE CALIBER OF FREQUENCY. OF OUR COMMUNICATIONS AND INTERACTION WITH THEM IN BETWEEN MEETINGS. BLUNTLY. I THINK THAT WE ATE HIS STANDARD OURS AND SHARPEN THE MANNER IN WHICH WE ANALYZE AND PRESENT DATA. IN ORDER TO BETTER PREPARE AND SUPPORT THEIR OVERSIGHT IN POLICY MAKING. WE ARE ALSO LOOKING INTO WAYS TO RESTRUCTURE OUR COMMITTEE STRUCTURES. OF MORE ON THAT AS WE PROCEED. BUT ONE OF THE OTHER TOP PRIORITIES IS OF COURSE ADDRESSING OUR SOLVENCY. OUR STAFF HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE DC BUDGET OFFICE. TO ANALYZE OUR OUR OPERATING EXPENSES AND ANALYZE OUR REVENUE STREAMS. OF THE NEXT STEPS WILL INVOLVE WORKING WITH THE DC LEGISLATIVE OFFICE AND OF COURSE WE ALREADY HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH. BOTH THE SENATE SIMPLY STAFF OFFICES AS WELL. THEY PROVIDED SOME VERY VERY WELL APPRECIATE INFORMATION AND AND A. COUNCIL AS WE DRAFT OUR LEGISLATION TO UPDATE OUR FEE STRUCTURE FOR BOARDS AND REVIEW AND APPROVAL LATER. AND THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE THE NPT. AND COMPLIED SETTING MR FEEL ADMISSION AND COMPLIES WITH. AB TWELVE TWENTY NINE WE HAVE HAD OUR INITIAL MEETING WITH THE OF OUR LAST WEEK. TO DISCUSS THE FUNCTION OPERATIONS. OF OUR ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS. AND OUR FIRST REPORT TO THE DIRECTOR LEGISLATURE.

HAD WORKED WITH STEPHANIE AND WHEN. MR BEN FRANKS HAD. BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE. PROBLEMS THAT AROSE FROM CASES BEING CLOSE INADVERTENTLY BRIAN DID LOOK AT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF DEAL BY. HAS PLACED. THE REVAMPED THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO CORRECT THOSE ERRORS SO THAT. THEY WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. SO. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT FOR THAT IN AND THEN IN LIGHT OF RE STARTING. OF COMMITTEE WORKING LATE TWENTY SIXTEEN BECAUSE PRIOR TO THAT. OUR COMMITTEES FOR THE BOARD OF WORD NOT FUNCTIONING OR WERE SEIZED. AT THAT TIME. THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WITH THE EO WILL BE RECHARGING THE COMMITTEES TO ENSURE THEIR WORK IS ALIGNED WITH RELEVANT STRATEGIC GOALS.

A WE RECEIVED AT THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN STRATEGIC. PLAN GOALS AND WE READ VIEW THOSE AS AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND IDENTIFY WHICH OF THOSE GOALS WOULD BE BEST ADDRESSED BY BOAT RELATED COMMITTEES AND OF COURSE STAFFING THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE GOALS. THOSE GOALS WERE THEN FORWARDED. TO BOARD COMMITTEES ALONG WITH AS SAMPLES OF BENCHMARKS AND METRICS ANOTHER WHICH DELIVER BULL EXPECTATIONS. AND THE COMMITTEES HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH ENSURING THAT THOSE DELIVERABLES ARE REALISTIC. AS WELL AS REASONABLE. AND I JUST WANNAREMIND EVERYONE THAT COMMITTEES THESE RECONSTITUTED COMMITTEES. ARE COMPOSED OF BOARD MEMBERS. AND INCLUDE STAFF. WERE RELATED TO THE EACH COMMITTEE. THEREFORE IT'S STAFF AND BOARD MEMBERS TALKING ABOUT FROM A WORK PERSPECTIVE WHAT IS REALISTIC AND WHAT CAN BE DONE. AND THEN OF COURSE BOARD. BRUCE ARE ENGAGING STAFF AND BETTER WILL BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW WORK IS DONE. ADDITIONALLY TO ENSURE THAT THE THE STRATEGIC PLANNING REMAINS AN ACTIVE PART OF OUR WORK IS A BOARD. WE AS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WILL BE PROPOSING THAT THERE BE A REGULAR. AND SYSTEMIC STRATEGIC PLANNING REVIEW AND UPDATE. SO THAT ONE CAN LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT I CALL LIVING. STRATEGIC GOALS.

LOCATION OR SHEEN AND A PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE NEXT AND FINAL THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU VERY MUCH. THE FINAL ITEM WHICH IS THE. OF THOSE ISSUES ADDRESSED BY THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SO WE HAVE SOMEONE. REPRESENTATIVE FR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO DISCUSS THE RECENT REPORT ON CASE TIME LINES GOOD AFTERNOON. PLEASE AND AFTERNOON. CHAIRMAN HELD HER MELLOW AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON BEHALF OF ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE YOUR BEST SERRA. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY MY NAME IS SERRANO OUT TO PET AND I AM DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. I'M HERE TODAY WITH GLORIA CASTRO WHO'S TO MY LEFT. SHE'S SENIOR ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF DOJ'S HEALTH QUALITY ENFORCEMENT SECTION AND TO MY RIGHT IS LINDA SCHNEIDER WHO IS SENIOR ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF DOJ'S LICENSING SECTION. WE'RE PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE DOJ'S ROLE IN THE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS FOR DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS CLIENT AGENCIES. AND. HOW WE ARE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S FIRST REPORT? REQUIRED UNDER BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE SECTION THREE ONE TWO POINT TWO. I WILL NOW TURN IT OVER TO GLORIA AND LINDA TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF HOW WE FIT INTO DC IS CONSUMER PROTECTION ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVE TIMELINE. AND PROVIDE CONTEXT FOR THE REPORT WHICH IS BASED ON OUR HANDLING OF LITIGATION CASES. GOOD AFTERNOON. BY WAY OF BACKGROUND THE LICENSING SECTION AND THE HEALTH QUALITY ENFORCEMENT SECTION IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE ARE AT THE TWO SECTIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROSECUTING. DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS AGAINST PROFESSIONAL AND VOCATIONAL LICENSEES. BETWEEN THE TWO WE REPRESENT THIRTY EIGHT DC EIGHT CLIENTS. WE TAILOR OUR SERVICES TO EACH OF OUR CLIENTS SPECIFIC NEEDS AND RESOURCES. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE HIGHEST QUALITY LEGAL REPRESENTATION. OUR ROLE IN THE DC ENFORCEMENT TIMELINE IS TO ADJUDICATE DISCIPLINARY CASES FOR OUR CLIENTS. ENFORCEMENT BEGINS WITH THE DC A CLIENT AGENCY RECEIVING A CONSUMER COMPLAINT. AND ENDS WITH A FINAL DECISION REACHED BY THE AGENCY. DOJ'S PART IN THIS PROCESS FALLS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. BEGINNING WITH THE RECEIPT OF THE REFERRAL FROM OUR CLIENTS. ENDING WITH THE EDUCATIONOF THE CASE. AT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. THE DEFINITION OF ADJUDICATION OF OUR WORK AT THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MEANS THAT OUR WORK IS COMPLETED. AND THE MATTER IS THEN BROUGHT BACK BEFORE THE CLIENT AGENCY FOR THEIR FINAL DECISION. ADJUDICATION OCCURS OF ONE OF FOUR WAYS. NUMBER ONE SUBTLE MAN NUMBER TWO DEFAULTS NUMBER THREE SUBMISSION OF THE MATTER TO THE OFFICE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS. AND FOURTH WITHDRAWAL OF THE ACCUSATION. THERE CAN BE MORE THAN ONE ADJUDICATIVE EVENT AND EACH CASE SUCH AS WHEN MORE THAN ONE LICENSEE IS NAMED IN A SINGLE ACCUSATION OR WHEN THE AGENCY DOES NOT A STOP EXCEPT. A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT. OR WHEN THE CLIENT AGENCY NANA TOPSY PROPOSED DECISION BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE. FOR EACH CLIENT THE TOURNEY GENERAL'S REPORT LISTS THE VOLUME. OF ANNUAL ACCUSATION REFERRALS RECEIVED REJECTED OR RETURNED FOR MORE INVESTIGATION. THE REPORT ALSO PROVIDES AVERAGES FOR THE COMPLETION AT EACH STAGE OF THE PROCESS FOR THE CASE IS ADJUDICATED DURING THE REPORTING YEAR. THE PROSECUTION OF A CASE IS AN INTERACTIVE PROCESS BETWEEN THE ASSIGNED DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS WHICH TYPICALLY INCLUDE. CLIENTS LICENSEES AND THEIR COUNSEL WITNESSES AND THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS. THE FIRST STEP IN PROSECUTION IS WHEN A DCA CLIENT REFERS I COMPLETED INVESTIGATION TO THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL REVIEWS THE CASE TO DETERMINE WHETHER DISCIPLINARY ACTION IS APPROPRIATE. AS DISCUSSED IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S REPORT. WHILE THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT INVESTIGATIVE METHODS USED BY DIFFERENT DCA CLIENT AGENCIES TO COLLECT EVIDENCE. EVERY ACCUSATION MATTER REFERRED TO OUR OFFICE IS REVIEWED BY. A DEPUTY TO DETERMINE SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE. SPECIFICALLY A DEPUTY CAREFULLY ANALYZES THE EVIDENCE TO DETERMINE WHERE THE WEATHER IT IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE STANDARD OF PROOF TO SUSTAIN DISCIPLINARY CHARGES.THIS ANALYSIS CAN INCLUDE REVIEW OF EXPERT AND LAZY WITNESS STATEMENTS OR TESTIMONY AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE SUCH AS MEDICAL RECORDS. BECAUSE A LICENSEE A LICENSE AS A PROPERTY RIGHT A LICENSEE HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS. WHICH REQUIRES THAT WE MEET A HIGHER BURDEN OF PROOF BEFORE THE LICENSE IS TAKEN AWAY. MOST OFTEN IT IS CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE TO A REASONABLE CERTAINTY STANDARD. THAT'S A HIGH STANDARD TO MEET. IF THE DEPUTY DETERMINES THE EVIDENCE IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THIS BURDEN. AND THAT ANY STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS DOES NOT BAR PROSECUTION. THEY WILL DRAFT ACCUSATIONS SETTING FORTH THE CLIENT'S JURISDICTION ALLEGES CHARGES AND RELEVANT STATUTES. AFTER SUPERVISORY REVIEW THE DRAFT ACCUSATION IS THEN PRESENTED TO THE DCA CLIENT AGENCY FOR ITS REVIEW AND FILING. IF THE EVIDENCE. IS NOT SUFFICIENT. THE DEPUTY REQUEST FURTHER INVESTIGATION FROM THE CLIENT. AS REPORTED FOR EACH AGENCY IF THIS IS REQUIRED THE COP THAT TIME TO CONDUCT THE SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATION IS INCLUDED IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS. FROM RESITA REFERRAL INTO THE ACCUSATION IS PREPARED BY THE ASSIGNED DEPUTY. WE IN TRUCKLOADS THING WITH OUR CLIENTS DURING THIS INITIAL PHASE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CASE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD IN A DISCIPLINARY PROCESS. IF THE FILING BURDEN IS NOT AN ACCUSATION IS DRAFTED. THIS IS SIGNED TO THE DCA KLEIN AGENCY. THE CLIENT'S OWN STAFF REVIEWS THE DRAFT ACCUSATION AND THEN PRESENTED TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER OR ANY OTHER AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE WHO CAN SIGN AS THE COMPLAINANT IN THE CASE. THE ACCUSATION IS FILED WHEN IT IS SIGNED BY THE COMPLAINANT THE COMPLAINANT BEING IN THE CLIENT AGENCY. THE ACCUSATION MAY LATER BE AMENDED TO ADD AN EXTRA CHARGES. THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS FROM THE RECEIPT OF THE REFERRAL. UNTIL THE ACCUSATION IS FILED IS REPORTED FOR EACH AGENCY IN OUR REPORT. THIS PERIOD INCLUDES THE TIME TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THE EVIDENCE. LEGAL RESEARCH TO DEPART DETERMINE APPROPRIATE CHARGES THE DRAFTING OF THE ACCUSATION. AND REVIEW BY THE CLIENT AND AGENCIES FILING OF ACCUSATION. CASE IS ADJUDICATED BY SETTLEMENT FOLLOWING NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN THE REPORT AS WELL AS DEFAULTS. THE PROCESS OF SETTING A HEARING BEFORE THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS. AND THE TIME IT TAKES TO COMMENCE A HEARING AS REPORTED FOR EACH AGENCY IS A VERY INTERACTIVE PROCESS. FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL MUST ENSURE PROPER VENUE. THE DEPUTY MUST ENSURE TO BE ABLE TO COORDINATE POTENTIAL HEARING DATES WITH OPPOSING COUNSEL ALL WITNESSES INCLUDING EXPERT WITNESSES. AS WELL AS THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS ON CARING CALENDAR. COMPLEX CASES AND THOSE THAT INVOLVE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS GENERALLY TAKE LONGER. BECAUSE IT TAKES MORE TIME TO GET THE HEARING SCHEDULED. AND THERE IS A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN WHEN A HEARING IS SET TO WIN A HEARING COMMENCES. IN THE SIMPLEST CASES THAT DO NOT REQUIRE LIVE TESTIMONY HEARING MAY COMMENCE WITHIN NINETY DAYS OR LESS. ON THE OTHER HAND COMPLEX CASES CAN REQUIRE SEVERAL WEEKS OF HEARING. THE SETTING OF THOSE HEARING DATES ARE DEPENDENT LIKE WE SAID ON MANY SCHEDULES. AND DURING THE TIME BEFORE THE HEARING DISCOVERIES EXCHANGE AND REVIEWED SUBPOENAS WERE SERVED. AND THE FILING OF MOTIONS TO COMPEL EVIDENCE. INTO EXCLUDED ARE CONSIDERED. ALL STEPS IN THIS PROCESS ARE GOVERNED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT. WELL NOW GO FOR A FEW HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE REPORT BUT AS A BRIEF ASIDE WE WANT TO NOTE THAT BECAUSE THE LIFE OF A CASE MAY SPAN MORE THAN ONE FISCAL YEAR. THE REPORT INCLUDES DATA FROM CASES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BEFORE THE START OF THE FIRST DATA COLLECTION PERIOD WHICH WAS JULY FIRST TWENTY SIXTEEN. NOW TO THE MAJOR HIGHLIGHTS. GENERALLY ABOUT TWELVE PERCENT OF ACCUSATION MATTERS ARE RESOLVED AFTER HEARING ON THE MERITS AT THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS. DEFAULTS ARE TAKEN AGAINST LICENSEES IN ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE CASES. FINALLY ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF ACCUSATIONS ARE SETTLED EITHER THROUGH PROBATION TERMS AIMED TO REHABILITATE THE LICENSEE AS DICTATED BY THE CLIENT. DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES. OR BY WAY OF REVOCATION OR SURRENDER OF THE LICENSE. IF PROBATION IS INCONSISTENT WITH PUBLIC PROTECTION. AS EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS THE DISCIPLINE OF LICENSEES SERVES TWO PURPOSES. PUBLIC PROTECTION AND REHABILITATION WHEN APPROPRIATE. THE PROCESS OF BALANCING BOTH THE INTERESTS AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF DUE PROCESS TAKES TIME. A TOURNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS AWARE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS CONSUMER PROTECTION ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVE OF TWENTY TIMES. WHICH SET A GOAL OF THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE TO FIVE HUNDRED FORTY DAYS OR TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS. FROM CONSUMER COMPLAINT THROUGH INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION TO FINAL AGENCY DECISION OR OTHER OUTCOME. WHILE WE WERE NOT INVOLVED IN THE SETTING OF THOSE PERFORMANCE METRICS WE HAVE ALWAYS BALANCE EFFECTIVENESS. AND EFFICIENCY AT EVERY JUNCTURE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS. THIS INSURERS EACH LICENSEE THEIR DAY IN COURT. AS THEIR CASE IS JUDGED INDEPENDENTLY ON ITS OWN MERITS. WE CONSIDER OURSELVES. OUR CLIENTS PARTNERS INEFFECTIVELY MOVING THESE CASES THROUGH THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS. WE HOPE THAT THE PUBLICATION OF THIS REPORT WILL HELP FACILITATE AND THAT CONTINUED DIALOGUE TO FIND EFFICIENCIES ARE POSSIBLE AND ASSIGN RESOURCES WERE NEEDED. IT'S BEEN AN HONOR TO BE INVOLVED IN THE PROTECTION OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMERS. ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. VERY MUCH QUESTIONS. THE COUPLE AND HE IS THE ONE IS IT IS DIFFICULT FROM THE REPORT. TO DETERMINE EXACTLY HOW LONG THE INVESTIGATION WILL TAKE THE. IN ON AVERAGE SHIP FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO BASICALLY HANDLE A CASE FROM THE TIME IT IS REFERRED. TO THE FILING OF AN ACCUSATION UNTIL A HEARING DATE IS SET IN THE FINAL DECISION ISSUED ITS KIND OF THE NUMBERS ARE LISTED BUT THEY'RE NOT. THERE'S NO REAL TOTAL OR A WAY TO LOOK AT EXACTLY HELP LONGER OR AN ORDER SETTLEMENT. CAN YOU GIVE US AN IDEA OF HOW LONG THE CASE CAN TAKE. FROM THE TIME YOU RECEIVE IT UNTIL PROPOSED DECISION IS ISSUED BY L. A. L. J. OR IF IT'S SETTLED. I KNOW EACH AGENCY IS DIFFERENT BUT THE. JUST AN AVERAGE OF HOW LONG IT MIGHT TAKE WOULD BE HELPFUL. IT DEPENDS. YEAH WE WE HANDLE CASES FOR LOTS OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT SUBJECT MATTERS AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT GO INTO EACH CLIENT'S WORK. SO WHEN I SAY IT DEPENDS I DON'T MEAN TO BE CAVALIER. BUT FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE FAST TRACK PROGRAM THAT THE LICENSING STARTED WITH THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING AND BE. PART OF A CASE ON DRESSING AND PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. WE TOOK A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF THEIR CASES THOSE BEING THE ONES THAT ARE THE. CASES THAT DON'T REQUIRE WITNESSES AND WE PUT THEM SORT OF ON A FAST TRACK TO MOVE THEM FORWARD QUICKLY. UNDER THE THEORY THAT WE DON'T WANT THOSE SIMPLER CASE IS TO SIMPLY GET IN LINE BEHIND ALL THE OTHER CASES THAT MAY BE MORE COMPLICATED. SO IN THAT BATCH OF WORK WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE THOSE CASES FORWARD VERY QUICKLY. AND THE INVESTIGATIVE PIECE THAT YOU MENTIONED ISN'T PRESENT BECAUSE THE CASES ARE CASTIGATED ON THE FRONT END BY THE CLIENT AGENCIES AND THEN SENT TO US. AND ONE OF OUR REQUIREMENTS FOR TO GO INTO OUR FAST TRACK PROGRAM IS THAT EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE THERE. SO THOSE CASES WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD VERY QUICKLY AND NOW MAY BE AND AND THE OTHER PART OF IT IS. THAT IF CASES. SETTLE. THEIR GOING TO RESOLVE MUCH MORE QUICKLY THAN A CASES GO TO HEARING. SO IN THAT BATCH OF CASES THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM ARE SETTLED. AND SO WITH ALL OF THOSE THINGS IN MIND THEY CAN BE DONE AND REALLY VERY QUICKLY ON MAYBE AN AVERAGE OF. YEAH NINETY TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS. BUT HEN ON THE OTHER HAND YOU TAKE SOMETHING LIKE. A DENTAL BOARD CASE. WHERE YOU MAY HAVE A VARIETY OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS AGAINST A DENNIS SAID OF EACH HAD TO BEEN INVESTIGATED AND ALL INVOLVED? PATIENT RECORDS AND THAT SORT OF THING AND THAT'S GOING TO MOST LIKELY HAVE OPPOSING COUNSEL THE CASES ARE GOING TO BE MUCH MORE HARD FOUGHT. AND THOSE CAN TAKE MUCH MUCH LONGER. SO NO ONE MESSAGE WE'D LIKE TO BRING BACK IS THAT IT'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. FOR HANDLING OUR CASES NOR WOULD I THINK IT BE HELPFUL TO HAVE JUST A. SINGULAR CONCEPT UP HOW LONG CASES SHOULD TAKE. THEN IN THAT A HIKE I CAN SEE WHERE THAT WOULD WOULD PLAY OUT OF. AND AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFIER DEFINED WITHIN ONE PARTICULAR CASE IN IT YOU KNOW THERE'S NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL OBVIOUSLY IN THOSE BUT. IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN A CONCERN OF OURS IN ONE ISSUE THAT I KNOW IS BEEN RAISED HIS. UNDER THEIR WHEN THEY WERE INSTANCES WHERE BOARDS MAY PROVIDE. DENTAL EVIDENCE OF VIOLATIONS. OF THE LAW IT DIRECTLY TO YOUR STAFF WHICH DOES NOT GO THROUGH A. A IS TO DIVIDE INVESTIGATOR SHOW WHICH IS CLEARLY HERE'S THE VIOLATION. I KNOW THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD HAS ITS OWN INVESTIGATORS AND THEY SOMETIMES WILL DO THAT. BORDER FOR FOR THAT OR FOR FINDINGS DIRECTLY TO YOU. OF WHEN THEY BELIEVE INSPECTORS ARE THERE ON SWORN INVESTOR STAFF OF UNCOVERED MAJOR ISSUES. ARE THERE CERTAIN CASES THAT ALWAYS NEED. A DEPARTMENT OF UPPER DIVISION OF INVESTIGATIONS. INVESTIGATOR. INVESTIGATION. OR CAN YOU ACT ON JUST FACTS THAT ARE BROUGHT TO YOU VIOLATIONS OF OF OF LONG. THAT'S A THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION SENATOR HELL. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS REPORT WILL BE ABLE TO SHOW OUR CLIENTS SPECIFICALLY WITH THEIR OWN CASELOADS. HOW FREQUENTLY THEIR CASES REQUIRE FURTHER INVESTIGATION BEFORE AN ACCUSATION CAN BE FILED? IN THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND PART YOUR QUESTION AS. EVEN THOUGH WE CAN USE DEPUTIES TO ASSIST OUR CLIENTS. FROM TIME TO TIME IT DOES REQUIRE SWORN FOR NON SWORN INVESTIGATOR BECAUSE THEY WILL BE THE WITNESSES IN THE CASE. WE BELIEVE OUR REPORT. WILL ALLOW OUR CLIENTS TO COMPARE THEIR FREQUENCY OF CASES THAT WE HAVE TO SEND BACK FOR MORE INVESTIGATION. MISSION LIGHTER AND I BELIEVE THAT BOTH SECTIONS TOGETHER OR OVERALL AVERAGE IS TEN PERCENT SO CLIENTS CAN COMPARE HOW THEY FALL. WITHOUT AVERAGE. AND WE TRY TO AVOID HAVING TO SEND CASES BACK FOR MORE INVESTIGATION OBVIOUSLY AND. OUR SHOP IN LINDA'S LEAD TO A LOT OF TRAINING OF INVESTIGATIONS INVESTIGATORS AT. WE ALSO PROVIDE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE RECENTLY. LINDA SHOP PROVIDED A BEER AND INVESTIGATORS AND BOTH NORTH AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TRAINING. AS WELL AS PRIVACY PROTECTION TRAINING. AND JUST LAST WEEK OUR OFFICES WERE PROVIDING TRAINING WAS SOLID. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS FOR THEIR ENFORCEMENT ACADEMY SO IT IS A MUTUAL GOAL THAT THESE INVESTIGATIONS BE DONE TO THE BEST QUALITY POSSIBLE AND WE CONSIDER SOULS PARTNERS AND MAKING SURE THAT WHEN THEY SEND US CASES. THEY'RE READY TO GO. WE DON'T BELIEVE IN WASTING TIME EITHER. IT WHEN YOU MENTION NON SWORN WE WERE TALKING RIVERS BEGIN NON SWORN. WITHIN THE DEVICE OR NON SWORN WITHIN THE BOARD. AND THERE'S NOT SWORN INDIA BY A AND H. COULD YOU. BUT IT. AS WE MENTIONED IN OUR REPORT THERE'S. MANY MANY INVESTIGATIVE METHODS THERE'S NON SWORN. AT EITHER WITH THE CLIENT. OR AT DFI. I'M SOME CLIENTS HAVE INSPECTORS FOR EXAMPLE BOARD OF PHARMACY EMPLOYEES INSPECTORS WHO HAPPENED TO BE PHARMACISTS. ON MANY OF OUR CLIENTS AND H. CUTIE. ACTUALLY HELP DESK INVESTIGATION SO OUR LIAISONS TRAIN. DESK INVESTIGATORS ARE NOT SWORN THEY'RE NOT NON SWORN THEIR STAFF MEMBERS AND WE HELP THEM WITH THEIR CASES. AND. OF COURSE YOU'VE ALL HEARD OF pTHERE'S ALSO A A LIGHTER METHOD WHERE IT'S A LIGHTER TOUCH THE LIAISON MAY BE WORKING VERY CLOSELY ON AN ENTRANCES MENTION ORDER WITH DFI INVESTIGATORS AND LINDA'S. SHOP. THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS IS TO COMMUNICATE IF PROCESS IT'S A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS. BECAUSE WE ALL WANT TO ACHIEVE PUBLIC PROTECTION. AND REHABILITATE THE LICENSEES THAT SHOULD BE REHABILITATED THEY'RE GOOD THANK YOU FOR MUCH OF ANY QUESTIONS OF THE QUESTION JEAN NONE WILL NOW OPEN THIS TO PUBLIC COMMENT IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO. CONTRIBUTE OR ASK THE MAKE SOME PUBLIC COMMENT RELATED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. BUT TO PLEASE COME FORWARD. AND WE WERE LIMITED TO MINUTES. GET. PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU TO THE GERMAN HELEN GERMAN LOW IN NUMBERS. MY NAME IS CONNIE VALENTINE AND FROM THE CALIFORNIA PROTECTIVE PARENTS ASSOCIATION. I AM BRINGING AN ISSUE OF GREAT CONCERN ABOUT TWO OF THE. MEMBER AGENCIES. AT THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY IN THE BOARD OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES. THE BACKGROUND IS CHILD CUSTODY DISPUTES. WHEN THEY OCCUR FAMILY COURTS MAY APPOINT PRIVATE EVALUATORS. THEY'RE LICENSED UNDER THESE TWO BOARDS. WHEN THE ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD SEX ABUSE. THESE EVALUATORS ARE SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW CERTAIN PROTOCOLS IN FAMILY CODE THIRTY ONE EIGHTEEN. HOWEVER THEY'RE OFTEN APPOINTED UNDER EVIDENCE CODE SEVEN THIRTY EXPERT WITNESS CODE. AND SEEM NOT TO FOLLOW THESE PROTOCOLS. THESE PROFESSIONALS ARE NOT REGULATED. AND THEY CHARGE WHATEVER THE MARKET WILL BEAR UP TO SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR SINGLE EVALUATION. THE LITIGANTS ARE FORCED TO PAY THESE FEES. THE COURTS DO NOT PAY THEM. THAT PLUS THE PROFESSIONALS HAVE IMMUNITY BECAUSE THEIR COURT APPOINTED. THESE ARE CONSIDERED PREDATORY PRACTICES BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF REGULAR REGULATION. VERY OFTEN THEY'RE PAID BY THE ACCUSED PERSON IN THE CASE. AND THEY RECOMMENDED CUSTODY TO THE ACCUSED. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT SEVENTY THREE PERCENT OF THE PARENTS WHO ARE TRYING TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN. LOST CUSTODY BECAUSE THE COURT FOLLOWED THESE PROFESSIONALS RECOMMENDATIONS. THE PROBLEM IS IS THE OVERSIGHT AGENCIES THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY IN THE BOARD OF ABOVE OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES. SAY THE COURT HAS OVERSIGHT OF THESE PROFESSIONALS BECAUSE THEY'RE QUITE A POINT COURT APPOINTED. HOWEVER THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL SAYS THAT THE PROFESSIONAL OVERSIGHT AGENCIES HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE LICENSED. THIS HOT POTATO HAS BEEN IN PLAY FOR ABOUT A DECADE. SO WE'RE NOW TURNING TO YOU THE LEGISLATURE AND TO THE. DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS TO HELP US SORT THIS OUT. WE'RE NOT SURE WHERE TO GO FROM HERE. I WOULD LIKE ANY KIND OF FEEDBACK YOU'D LIKE TO GIVE US THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE COMMENT NEXT TO. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR HELL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S KATHLEEN RUSSELL WITH THE CENTER FOR JUDICIAL EXCELLENCE BASED SIMMERING COUNTY CALIFORNIA. WE ARE ALSO HERE WITH CONCERNS ABOUT THE BOARD OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES AND THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY. TO BE CLEAR COUNTLESS INNOCENT CHILDREN ARE BEING FORCED INTO LIFETIMES OF SEXUAL SLAVERY OR ONGOING PHYSICAL ABUSE BY A PARENT AS A DIRECT RESULT OF. LICENSEES OF THE BOP IN BBS WHO ARE UTILIZING JUNK SCIENCE. WHICH HAS BEEN. DEBUNKED BY EVERY CREDIBLE MEDICAL LEGAL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATION AT LEAST FIFTY THREE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN HAVE BEEN MURDERED. BY A DIVORCING ARE SEPARATING PARENT IN THE LAST DECADE. FIFTY THREE MURDER CHILDREN IS LIKE THREE OF THE MASS SHOOTINGS THAT JUST OCCURRED AT MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL. THESE ARE SERIOUS CASES. THESE BOARDS HAVE A DUTY TO PROTECTTHE PUBLIC FROM MISCONDUCT BUT THEY'RE FAILING MISERABLY WITH DISCIPLINE RATES THAT MIRROR THOSE THAT WARRANTED. A J. LACK AUDIT OF THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE. JUST O REQUESTS OF THE DCA REGARDING THESE BOARDS. I KNOW THAT LAST YEAR AS PART OF THE BACKGROUND PAPER FOR THE SUNSET REVIEW HEARING. THERE WERE PRIORITIZATION GUIDELINES ISSUED BY THE DC EIGHT TO ITS MEMBER BOARD SENDEROS. WE'VE BEEN TO FOUR OUT OF THE LAST FIVE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY MEETINGS OVER THE LAST YEAR. AND IT APPEARS TO US THAT THESE GUIDELINES ARE NOT BEING UTILIZED ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT WE DEAL WITH IN HERE ON A DAILY BASIS ARE. URGENT. COMPLAINTS AND THEY CONTINUE TO GO AND PERSIST FOR. UPWARDS OF THREE OR FOUR YEARS. THERE'S A WASHINGTON POST MAGAZINE ARTICLE WHICH I'VE SENT TO YOUR STAFF FOR THIS HEARING. WAS EIGHT EIGHT PAGE ARTICLE OF COVER FEATURE STORY LAST MAY THAT CALLS OUT A BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY FOR NOT INVOLVE GETTING INVOLVED IN. WHAT IS ALSO A PROBLEM IS MULTIPLE LICENSEES HAVE MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS THOUGH SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED SO? WE STRONGLY URGE THE DCA TO UPDATE OR REVISE ITS PRIORITIZATION GUIDELINES FOR ALL BOARDS AND BUREAUS. TO ENSURE THAT INVESTIGATIONS OF LICENSEES WITH MULTIPLE URGENT COMPLAINTS BE PRIVATE BE PRIORITIZED ABOVE ALL OTHERS. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PLEASE FIGURE OUT A WAY TO HOLD THE BOARDS ACCOUNTABLE FOR IMPLEMENTING THESE GUIDELINES. WE HEARD AT THE BERKELEY MEETING LAST FALL AT THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY. THE TWENTY ONE LICENSEES HAVE TWO TO FIVE COMPLAINTS PENDING. AGAINST EACH AND. TOTAL ABOUT TOTALS FIFTY COMPLAINTS ONE LICENSEE HAS FOUR COMPLAINTS AND ANOTHER HAS FIVE. AND WE'RE FAIRLY CERTAIN THE WASHINGTON POST MAGAZINE FEATURE WAS DEALING WITH ONE OF THOSE THAT HAD FOUR OR FIVE COMPLAINTS. AGAINST HIM FINALLY. AND WE WOULD ALSO URGE THE DCA TO INSIST THAT THE BOARD OF PSYCH IN THE BBS ADOPTIVE VERTICAL ENFORCEMENT AND PROSECUTION MODEL FOR ALL URGENT CASES INVOLVING CHILDREN. SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT'S USED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA THESE OUR CHILDREN'S LIVES AND THEY'RE OFTEN BEING FORCED INTO. DANGEROUS HOMES OR THEY'RE BEING BEATEN RAPED MOLESTED AND SOMETIMES KILLED SO WAITING THREE TO FOUR YEARS IS DESTROYING CALIFORNIA CHILDREN THANK YOU SPECIAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL LOOK INTO THAT I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TODAY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT AFTERNOON CHERRY HILL THANK YOU FOR HAVING US MY NAME IS KATHERINE CAMPBELL LINE FROM YOUR DISTRICT. AND I'M HERE FOR THE SAME ISSUE I'M HERE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT CHILDREN. ARE BEING ABUSED. THEY'RE BEING. PHYSICALLY HURT. AND THEY'RE BEING. THEY'RE BEING RAPED. BY A PARENT BECAUSE AN EVALUATOR WHO HAS A LICENSE WITH THE BOARD. IS WORKING WITH HIM. I'M NOT SURE WHAT CULTURE THEY'RE WORKING WITHIN. AND THEY'RE WORKING WITHIN A CULTURE THAT THIS IS ACCEPTABLE THAT CHILDREN ARE. ALLOWED TO BE WITH AN ABUSIVE PARENT. IN CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE AN EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT CHANCE OF LOSING CUSTODY IF YOU REPORT ABUSE. DURING A DIVORCE AND THIS HAPPENS I'M IF YOUR CHILD IS NOT BEING PROTECTED. BYE CPS OR WHATEVER IT'S CALLED IN YOUR COUNTY. YOU END UP IN COURT TO PROTECT YOUR CHILD AND THEN YOU WERE LOOKED UPON AS A PERSON WHO. IS OUT FOR REVENGE IS DELUSIONAL IS. TELLING THE CHILD THAT THEY SHOULDN'T LIKE THE OTHER PARENT. WE END UP. HAVING THESE PARENTS GO TO THESE EVALUATORS WITH THESE. BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY AND BOARD OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES LICENSE IS. AND THESE ARE PEOPLE ARE DISMISSING ABUSE AND WHEN REPORTS ARE FILED AGAINST SOME COMPLAINTS. FIRST OFF. THOSE CHILDREN REMAIN WITH THEIR ABUSER. AND THEN YOU'RE HAVING OTHER FAMILY SEE THE SAME EVALUATOR. WE NEED TO PUT INTO PLACE AT AN EVALUATOR. A LICENSEE CAN. CAN BE PUT ON SUSPENSION WHILE THIS IS BEING REVIEWED THREE TO FOUR YEARS. THERE IS NO REASON WHY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO BE HURT. SO WE WANT TO ME POLICIES WE WANT OVERSIGHT FOR THESE BOARDS BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU I HAVE SEEN MANY COMPLAINTS ARE VALID AND HAVE BEEN DISMISSED. AND THERE'S NO REASON FOR THAT SO WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS. AND YOUR. AND WE HOPE THAT WE'RE BUILDING AWARENESS TO BRING POSITIVE CHANGE. INCLUDED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE TESTIMONY YOU ARE BUILDING AWARENESS RIGHT NOW SO THANK YOU WE WILL BE LOOKING INTO. THOSE ISSUES AND THANK YOU FOR COMING FORWARD TODAY. TO LET US KNOW WHICH IS THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT SO THANK YOU AND I WILL SAY I KNOW THIS IS YOUR MEETING BUT I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE DIRECTOR HAS LEFT BEFORE PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU AND WE DID TALK WITH HIM AND AND. WEEKLY LET HIM KNOW THAT HE WAS THAT HE COULD LEAVE BUT WE. INSENSITIVITY THE PUBLIC COMMENT BUT WE WILL TALK WITH HIM ABOUT THIS SO PRESSURED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT AND. NO OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. WE WILL CONCLUDE THE HEARING AND THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND RESPONDED TO THOSE QUESTIONS. THE HONDA THIS WILL CONCLUDE OUR OVERSIGHT HEARING AND OUR SUNSET REVIEW HEARINGS FOR THIS YEAR THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT. AND I WANTED TO SPEAK FOR A ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOW WHO HAD TO GO THROUGH SECTION OR HE WOULD BE HERE AND THANK YOU AS WELL SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. APPRECIATED THIS HEARING IS ADJOURNED
