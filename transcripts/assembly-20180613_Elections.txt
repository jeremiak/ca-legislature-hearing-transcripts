HAS TO DO WITH REDISTRICTING COMMISSION TO LT ME START BY. EXCEPT MEAN AMENDMENT SUGGESTS ANALYSIS AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING SO HARD. WITH MY OFFICE IN THE FOLKS AND COMMON CAUSE AND OTHERS TO. TO IMPROVE THIS BILL. SO THIS BILL BUILDS UPON PASSED LEGISLATION BY GIVING SCHOOL DISTRICTS. COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT SPECIAL DISTRICTS. THE AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH INDEPENDENT HYBRID OR ADVISORY COMMISSIONS. AND IT MAKES VARIOUS CHANGES TO STREAMLINING CLARIFY THE LAW. ALLOWING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO CREATE REDISTRICTING COMMISSIONS. AND BEGINNING WITH THE APPROVAL PROPOSITION ELEVEN NOT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THEM FOREVER HERE. REMEMBERS IT WELL. THAT WHICH THAT CREATED THE CITIZENS WERE DIFFERENT COMMISSION THIS YEAR SEE. INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING MISSIONS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO STRICT LINES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AS YOU ALL KNOW OF COURSE OUR STATE ASSEMBLY ARE SENATOR BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. AND OUR CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS ARE ALL DRAWN BY. THE AS CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING MISSION. NOW. A FOLLOWING ON THAT DRIVEN BY LOCAL NONPARTISAN. REDISTRICTING INTEREST THAT WAS OUT THERE I AUTHORED. L. S. B. ELEVEN OH EIGHT BACKING TWENTY SIXTEEN. WHICH AUTHORIZED ALL COUNTIES AND CITIES TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT OR ADVISORY. REGISTERED COMMISSION HOW CLOSELY. BASED ON THE THE STATEWIDE MODEL SO THIRTEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INCLUDING CITIES OF SAN DIEGO MODESTO OAKLAND SACRAMENTO. HAVE ALL STEPPED UP IN ESTABLISH THESE INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS. MOST BASICALLY MOVES THE REDISTRICTING PROCESS FROM THE ELECTED OFFICIALS THEMSELVES OF SUCH A. DEEPLY VESTED INTERESTED NOW THAT THE LINES ARE DRAWN OVER TO THESE INDEPENDENT. COMMISSIONS NOW THIS BILL BUILDS UPON THAT PASSED EFFORT. BY NOW EXTENDING THIS OPTION THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES WERE NOW EXTENDING IT. SCHOOL DISTRICTS COMMITTEE BECAUSE DISTRICTS AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. AND WE THEN GIVE THEM THE AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH INDEPENDENT HYBRID OR ADVISORY COMMISSION SAYS WILL BRING. MORE TRANSPARENT NONPARTISAN REDISTRICTING TO LOOK AT THEIR SECTIONS ARE THE STATE. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT'LL PROVIDE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WITH THE CHOICE. HAVE UTILIZING INDEPENDENT HYBRID ADVISORY REDUCING COMMISSIONS A DOZEN MANDATE THAT IT DOES THAT THEY DO THEY DO SO. SO. YOU KNOW WITH THAT BEING SAID I CAN TALK TO MARK IN DETAIL BY BY BELIEVE WITH ENJOYS. SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS AND. HAVE A HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE NICHOLAS I DON'T HEAR FROM COMMON CAUSE DOOR ROSE AS WELL FROM LEGAL MY VOTERS. AND THEY'RE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF BILLS WELL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR BERMAN MEMBERS NICHOLAS I DON'T WITH COMMON CAUSE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL. COMING BECAUSE FIRMLY SUPPORTS INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS AS A BEST PRACTICE IN REDISTRICTING STUDIES OF INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS LIKE CALIFORNIA'S COMMISSION. FIND THAT THEY TYPICALLY DO A BETTER JOB THAN LET'S THE BODIES DRAWING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES LONG A NUMBER OF METRICS INCLUDING KEEPING COMMUNITIES CITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS INTACT. PROMOTING PARTISAN FAIRNESS THOSE INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR MINORITY REPRESENTATION. IN CALIFORNIA IS THE AUTHOR MENTIONS SINCE CREATION THE STATE COMMISSION WE SEEN A SURGE OF INTEREST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND CREATING INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS. SAY THEY'RE FOURTEEN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WITH COMMISSIONS MOSTLY CHARTER CITIES. BUT IN RECOGNITION THIS DEMANDS. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE SENDER AUTHORED LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE PASSED S. B. ELEVEN NO WAIT TARTARUS COUNTIES IN GENERAL LAW CITIES TO ESTABLISH COMMISSIONS. IF THEY WANT TO. THIS BILL DOES A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT THINGS MOST IMPORTANTLY IT ALLOWS SELDOM MENTIONED A COMMUNICABLE DISTRICTS SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS CREATE INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS IF THEY WISH TO. WE'VE HEARD ABOUT A NUMBER OF INTEREST FROM SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS AS WELL SPECIAL DISTRICT BOARD MEMBERS INCLUDING THIS COMMITTEE RECEIVING. NUMBER OF LETTERS FROM SUCH MEMBER SAYING THEY'D LIKE THE SAME AUTHORITY THAT WE ARE TO EXTEND TO CITIES AND COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO CREATE THESE COMMISSIONS. WE SEE NO REASON WHY WHICH DEPRIVE THEM OF THE BUILDING IF THEY WANT TO ADOPT A BEST PRACTICE. THE BILL ALSO DOESN'T FINE TUNING ON EXISTING REQUIREMENTS FOR INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS FOR EXAMPLE BY PROHIBITING INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS FROM ENGAGING. IN PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING. THE BILL ALSO RELAXES SOME OF THE COMMISSION ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS THIS IS IN RECOGNITION OF COMMON CAUSE ON THE GROUND EXPERIENCE PARTICULARLY WITH SMALLER MIDSIZE COMMUNITIES. THAT HAVE A SMALLER POTENTIAL POOL OF APPLICANTS SWEAR FLEXING SOME OF THE OLD WILL BE REQUIREMENTS WE CAN MAKE IT EASIER FOR SUCH COMMUNITIES ESTABLISHED INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS. FINALLY THE BILL DOES JUST A FEW A FEW REWARDING IS TO MAKE THE BILL THE EXISTING LEGISLATION OF A CLEAR FOR EXAMPLE BY SPECIFYING THAT. ALL OF THE BILL REFERS TO RE DISTINCT MISSIONS. COMMUNITIES CAN ALSO CREATE DISTRICTING INDEPENDENT DISTRICTING COMMISSIONS WHICH REVIEW COMMISSION THE STATUS OF DISTRICT LINES FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SUPPOSED TO. READ DRAWING THOSE LINES. SO CONCLUDE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS CONTINUED LEADERSHIP AND PROMOTING THE BEST PRACTICES IN REDUCING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. CALIFORNIA'S BEEN JUST A LEADING LIGHT ON INDEPENDENT AFFAIR REDISTRIBUTE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL TO THIS BILL WE CAN CONTINUE. TO BE A LEADING LIGHT ON LOW PURCHASING AS WELL CRAWLEY'S REASON FOR VERY PROUD SPONSORED LEGISLATION IN THE SPORT CLEAR TONIGHT THOUGH. THANK YOU FOR.

DESPITE ALL THIS SIMPLIFICATIONS REMAIN THE PROCESS. THERE IS STILL A LOT OF PAPERWORK THAT IS INEFFICIENT IN OUR SYSTEM OPAL FORMS BEING FILLED OUT AND A LOT OF ADMINISTRATIVE TIME AND EXPENSE BEING CONTRIBUTED TO. A THE PROCESS OF GATHERING REGISTRATION. AND ACTUALLY COUNTING THOSE BALLOTS ACCURATELY THIS BILLS DESIGNED TO SIMPLIFY THE CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION PROCESS. BY ALLOWING US TO USE THOSE PROVISIONAL BALLOT ENVELOPES THAT. BEFORE VOTER REGISTRATION PURPOSES WELL YOU'RE ALREADY REQUIRED TO TO SIGN AN AFFIDAVIT ON ALL YOUR REGISTRATION. AND AS WELL AS THAT PROVISIONAL. BALLOT REGISTRATION. BUT IT'S A TWO STEP PROCESS RIGHT NOW WE FEEL LIKE IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND WILL BE JUST AS TRANSPARENT AND JUSTICE OF FRAUD RESISTANT. TO HAVE TWO SIGNATURES BECOME ONE AND. I'LL KEEP IT SIMPLE IN SHORT THEY'RE IN AND LET YOU ALL ASK ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT IT BUT I'VE FOLKS WHO KNOW A LOT MORE THAN I DO HERE WITH ME TODAY SO.

THAT THE CONDITIONAL REGISTRATION AND VOTING PROCESS ABOUT RAISING COUNTIES TO MERGE THE INFORMATION OF A VOTER REGISTRATION AFFIDAVIT AND THAT PROVISIONAL BALLOT ENVELOPE TOGETHER. ALL THE SAME CHECKS AND BALANCES WILL STILL EXIST AND LAUNCH PAD NOW. THEY SHALL STAY IN PLACE BUT BOTH VOTERS IN POLL WORKERS WILL HAVE A BETTER ELECTION DEXTER% WE BELIEVE AND WE I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I STAND READY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WE'RE READY FOR MOTION OURS AND THE SECOND OF ANYONE WANTS TO MAKE ONE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SECOND THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY MUCH IN THE SECOND. LIEBERMAN VOTERS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MY CHILD ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ST ON A BRING A BACK TO COLLEAGUES FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS VICE YOUR HARBOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP MISTER CHAIR I TWO ISSUES I HAVE THIS ONE IS THE OVERALL ISSUE THE SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION. I'D THAT OTHER STATES THAT HAVE THE SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION I HAVE REQUIREMENTS OF ID OR PROOF OF RESIDENCY OR. OTHER THINGS FIVE WHETHER BE ILLINOIS MINNESOTA COLORADO. CONNECTICUT OR NEW HAMPSHIRE AYE IN OUR SYSTEM STILL HAS A BIG GAP IN THAT. AND SO RATHER THAN NOW YOU KNOW EVEN A STATE LIKE ILLINOIS REQUIRES TWO FORMS OF IDENTIFICATION BUT. BUT WE HAVE THAT GAP. GAP HERE. SECOND ISSUE I WANTED TO BRING UP. BEYOND THAT AND ASK FOR YOUR CLARIFICATION IS IN THE PREPARATION FOR THE BILL WE DIDN'T HAVE LIKE A MOCK. IN TERMS OF WHAT IT DOES WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE AYE EUROPE. ENVELOPE YOU KNOW TYPICALLY LETTER SIZE BUT BUT I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE VOTER REGISTRATION FORM WHICH IS. EVEN LONGER THAN LEGAL SIZE HOOKING KIND OF KIND OF CLAIRE FIRE WALK THROUGH WHAT THAT WHAT THE PROCESS BECAUSE I'M LIKE WONDERING IS IT GONNA BE LIKE AN ENVELOPE LIKE THIS. PROBABLY NOT LIKE THERE IS A BET THAT BUT HOW BUT GET OUT WE KNEW WE HAD THE. I THINK THESE ARE FOR CERTIFICATE DOT ORG BUT. BUT NEVER THE LESS HOW HOW IS THAT ENVISIONED AYE IMPRACTICALITY SO THAT WHEN I GO IN REVERSE OR AND TAKE YOUR SECOND QUESTION FIRST AND DEFERRED THAT TO. OUR FOLKS IN THE REGISTRAR'S JUST TO GIVE A SENSE THERE IF YOU DON'T MIND YEAH SURE I. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER I THINK YOU GET IT WOULD BE A VERY LARGE AND LEFT FOR A FOR SURE I'VE RIGHT NOW MANY COUNTIES USE A OVERSIZED ENVELOP NOT A LETTER ENVELOPE BUT. AN ENVELOPE THAT IS MAYBE THAT THE MID SIZE VERSION OF THE INPUT THAT YOU JUST HELD UP AS THEY AYE AS THE ENVELOPE FOR CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION OR PROVISIONAL. AT BALLOT ENVELOPE AS WELL WHICH ARE TWO DIFFERENT PROCESSES BUT BASICALLY THE SAME THING. AYE AND THE INFORMATION THAT YEAH CAN I BE CONTAINED ON THAT% ENVELOPE SPECIAL USING BOTH SIDES OF THE ENVELOPE. WOULD CERTAINLY HANDLED THE INFORMATION THAT'S REQUIRED ON AN AFFIDAVIT OF REGISTRATIONS. THANK YOU THAT ADDRESS MY QUESTION AND THEN AS TO THE FIRST QUESTION I I THINK WE CAN DEBATE THAT THE MERITS OF. OF SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION I WOULD SAY THIS BILL. IS IN ABOUT THAT IT'S ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS OF OF PROVISIONAL BALLOTING AND AND AND VOTER REGISTRATION MECHANICS BUT. COUNTY STILL HALF TO MAKE THAT CHOICE WHETHER THEY'RE A VOTER CHOICE COUNTY OR. ANOTHER COUNTY THAT'S THAT'S DESIGNATING SPECIFIC SATELLITE LOCATIONS TO DO THOSE SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATIONS. THAT'S THE THAT TRIGGER IS STILL REQUIRED IN LAW THIS DOESN'T REMOVE THAT SO IT'S STILL AT THE COUNTY'S DISCRETION A. TO MAKE THAT DECISION AND I AYE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT THAT. WE'RE SORT OF TRYING TO STAY NARROW ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. I HAVE MY OWN OPINIONS ABOUT THE THE MERITS OF SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION BUT. I I I REALLY YET THAT'S NOT THE THE ISSUE THIS BILL'S TRYING TO SOLVE I WOULD JUST I WOULD OFFER THAT. RIGHT RIGHT GOT. FROM OUR VERY PEOPLE CHIEF CONSULTANT THAT THESE ARE ENVELOPES AT THE POLLS RIGHT SO IT'S NOT AS IF. THAT LARGER. AND LOOK TO POINT NUMBER TWO AS IF THAT LARGER ENVELOPES GOING OUT YOU KNOW THROUGH THE POSTAL SERVICE YEAH RIGHT AND IT OR DO YOU CHIMNEY SANTA DELIVERS YOU KNOW GIANT THINK RIGHT IT'S JUST THERE AT THE POLLS AND SO WE THINK PROCESSING. LOOK IS KEYED NON FISCAL BUT I THINK TO SAVE MONEY AND AND I THINK THAT THE THE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE AND MAY WE CAN DEVELOP THAT NOW HOUSES FOR THE FOURTH FLOOR BACKSEAT THINGS THAT TAXPAYERS SABER SO. ANYA THANK YOU PROCLAIM YET PATIENT OF COURSE. STEINORTH. SO I I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT PROVISIONAL BALLOTS IN GENERAL JUST BECAUSE IT IS KIND OF ONE OF THOSE AREAS WITHIN THE ELECTIONS CODE THAT'S KIND OF DARK. IT'S NOT A LOT OF LANGUAGE AND PROVISIONAL BALLOTS AND SO IT'S LEFT UP TO THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES TO DETERMINE HOW THEY'RE GOING TO PROCESS THEM INDIVIDUALLY WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT DECISION MAKERS. ON HOW PROVISIONAL BALLOTS ARE BEING CAST BECAUSE OUR ELECTIONS CODE IS SILENT MEANS I I THINK THAT'S A GREAT PLACE TO START. MAYBE TO START ACTUALLY PUTTING THE SAME VOTE BY MAIL PROVISIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON PROVISIONAL BALLOT BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU MY SIXTEEN RACE THERE WERE NINE PERCENT OF THE OVERALL ABOUT BALLOTS CAST WERE PROVISIONAL THIRTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT. AND MAJORITY OF THEM WERE FRAUDULENT THE MAJORITY WERE THROWN OUT BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY SPEND TWENTY ONE DAYS PROCESSING THEM THEY CAN COME UP WITH A LEGITIMATE REASON TO ACTUALLY MAKE JUSTIFICATION. THEY WERE LOOKING AT SIGNATURES THEY WEREN'T LOOKING AT ADDRESSES AND WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THOSE WAS JUST A MATTER OF HOW DO WE COUNTIES VOTE. AS BEST AS POSSIBLE WITH SAME DAY REGISTRATION AND THE FACT THAT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS FRAUD IN THE PROVISIONAL BALLOTING SYSTEM WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD WE WANT TO TRY AND MERGE THEM TOGETHER BECAUSE. TRADITIONALLY PROVISIONAL BALLOTS INTENDED FOR TWO PURPOSES. I GOT MY VOTE BY MAIL I FORGOT IT I WANNA GO VOTE I'D AND BRING IT WITH ME I GET A PROVISIONAL. I GO INTO A POLLING PLACE BECAUSE I'M NEAR WORK MY WORK IS NOT WHERE I WHERE I LIVE I'M RUNNING LATE I WANNA GO VOTE BY SHOW WEAPON I SAY HEY. I'M NOT ACTUALLY REGISTERED HERE I'M REGISTERED IT A DIFFERENT POLLING PLACE I'D LIKE TO VOTE PROVISIONALLY. THOSE ARE USUALLY THE TWO REASONS THAT PEOPLE WOULD VOTE PROVISIONALLY SO IN THE CASE WHERE YOU HAVE SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION WHY WOULD WE NEED THIS OVERLAPPING WHEN WE SEE THAT IN MY EXAMPLE SPECIFICALLY. NINE PERCENT OF THE VOTES THAT WERE CAST HALF OF THEM WERE THROWN OUT IS JUST COMPLETELY FRIED. I MEAN I I THINK IT'S A BIGGER PUBLIC POLICY QUESTION THAT. ISN'T IS A VALID DEBATE I I DON'T I THINK. YOU MAY VIEW THE SYSTEM IS IN PERFECT OR. FLAWED AT THIS POINT I DON'T THINK THIS COMPOUNDS THE PROBLEM IF ANYTHING I IT YOU KNOW FOR WHAT YOU SEE IT AS. I THINK IT ACTUALLY. WOULD RESULT IN IN LES MIS A MISS COUNTS OR LESS ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AT THAT POINT A OF OF PROCESSING BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE AS MANY FORMS FLYING AROUND BECAUSE. AT THIS POINT THIRD SORT TWO SETS OF PAPER COMING IN AT ALL SO WHEN THEY HAD TO GO THROUGH AND RECOUNT YEARS THERE AND THEY WERE TRYING TO MATCH THAT. TO THE REGISTRATION FILE RIGHT IN HERE. MISTAKEN IN ONE PLACE SO IF ANYTHING. THAT NINE PERCENT OR WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN. IN IN PURE WOULD BE EASIER TO GET TO I GUESS IS HOW I SEE THIS NAM SO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IS THIS WOULD BE IN LIEU UP SO INSTEAD OF PEOPLE SHOWING UP AND DOING SAME DAY REGISTRATION. THEY WOULD FILL OUT A PROVISIONAL THE PROVISIONAL WOULD ACT OUT YOUR SAME DAY REGISTRATION SO THE SAME DAY REGISTRATION GOES AWAY PROVISIONAL TAKES ITS PLACE. PROVISIONAL TAKES BECAUSE IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT IS TO CUT BACK ON THE AMOUNT OF PAPERWORK THIS ACTUALLY DOES THE OPPOSITE IF IF YOU ARE ELIMINATING SAME DAY REGISTRATION AND REPLACING A PROVISIONAL THAT AXIS SAME DAY REGISTRATION. THAT DOES ELIMINATE ONE ELEMENT BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA CONTINUOUS SAME DAY REGISTRATION AND THEN ALSO HAVE THEM VOTE PROVISIONAL BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IF YOU'RE DOING A SAME DAY REGISTRATION YOU WOULD THEN HAVE TO CAST A PROVISIONAL BALLOTS IN TIME. YOU WOULD HAVE DUPLICATION AT THAT POINT NOW WHAT HAPPENS THEN IF YOU'RE AUTOMATICALLY VOTING VB ADAM YOU FORGOT YOUR VB I'M YOU DON'T RECEIVE YOUR BBM WAS DELAYED WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. YOU FILL OUT A PROVISIONAL NOW ARE YOU DUPLICATING THE EFFORTS AT THE RV BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO THINK THAT THIS HAS TO BE SAME DAY REGISTRATION HOW ARE THEY GONNA MERGING PERCH. TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR REGISTRATION TWO OR THREE TIMES. YOUR MIND BY BY AT LEAST THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO IT SO SO. ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT I. I FULLY UNDERSTAND WORD WHERE YOUR QUESTION IS COMING FROM BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING. SIDE THIS OUR PROCESS OF SAME DAY REGISTRATION. I IS NOT NECESSARILY THEN MOVING TO A PROVISIONAL PROCESS THAT PROVISIONAL VOTING AS YOU MENTIONED HAPPENS FOR ADMITTED FOR REASONS BUT PRIMARILY FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT FORGET THE VOTE BY MAIL OR. WHO JUST FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF GOING TO A DIFFERENT POLLING PLACE ARE NOT ON THE ROSTER AND I WANT TO VOTE THEIR? SAVE A REGISTRATIONS A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT ANIMAL BECAUSE THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT I HAVE DECIDED NOT TO REGISTER BEFORE THAT FIFTEEN DAY CLOSE OF REGISTRATION AND DECIDED. I OR FOR FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT GUY NOW II AFTER THE CLOSE OF REGISTRATION THEY WANT TO COME TO OUR OFFICE AND BE ABLE TO REGISTER. AND VOTE AT THE SAME TIME SO THAT AND THE WORLD IS THAT IF WE'RE MERGING THESE TWO DOCUMENTS OF AN AFFIDAVIT OF REGISTRATION AND AN ENVELOPE. I'VE THAT IS THE PROCESS THEY COME IN THEY COMPLETE THE ENVELOPE. OR THAT AFFIDAVIT REGISTRATION WHICH IS THE ENVELOPE WHICH ALSO REQUIRES THEM TO. PROVIDE SOME PROVISIONAL AIR. VOTING INFORMATION AND THEN THEY OTE IT'S NOT AS IF THEY GO THROUGH STEP ONE AND THEN THEY GO TO A SECOND STEP FROM MORE PAPERWORK BIG CURRENTLY M. THE WAY IT STANDS NOW IF YOU DO SAME DEAD REGISTRATION YOU STILL THEN HAVE TO VOTE BY PROVISIONAL BALLOT. YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO PUT IN IN TRADITIONAL VOTING STREAM THAT IT IS SO THERE IS A DOUBLE STANDARD THERE'S ALREADY A DOUBLE STEP PROCESS THAT'S PUT INTO PLACE WHERE WERE ALREADY BEGINNING TO LEARN. WHAT SAME DAY REGISTRATION MEANS BECAUSE THIS IS OUR FIRST ELECTION CYCLE THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH IT SO NOW ADDING ANOTHER ANOTHER HURDLE? ON BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU MY REGISTRAR VOTER INSANE MEDINA COUNTY THE LARGEST GEOGRAPHICALLY AND MASS IN THE UNITED STATES THE WAY WE HAVE PROCESSED IT IS WHEN YOU TURN IN A PROVISIONAL BALLOT THEY'RE GONNA SEND YOUR VOTER REGISTRATION IN THE MAIL. THEY'RE GOING TO MISS JUST THE PROCESS BECAUSE WE WANT TO COUNT EVERY SINGLE LEGAL FELT THAT THERE IS TO IT TO COUNT. BUT IN THIS SCENARIO THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING IS WE WOULD STILL HAVE THAT LONG FORM THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER SHOWED BUT THEN YOU WOULD ALSO HAVE THE VERY LARGE ENVELOPE. AND THEN YOU WOULD THEN LEAVE IT TO THE REGISTRAR TO TRY AND OVERLAP THOSE TO YOU AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE DUPLICATION BECAUSE TO YOUR POINT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A HARD TIME DETERMINING WHICH ONES COME IN WITH SAME DAY REGISTRATION AND PBM. ISSUE ME AND PROVISIONAL AS IF THEY ALREADY ARE REGISTERED VPM OR THE REGISTER TRADITIONAL POLL VOTING BUT THEY JUST AND SHOW UP TO THE PRECINCT. THINK I MIGHT STILL BE MISSING YOUR PET YOUR LARGER POINT I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT JOHN. I I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT WHAT THE EXPERIENCE IS GOING TO BE FOR VOTER AYE IS NOT GOING TO BE EXACTLY WHAT MAYBE YOUR YOUR THINKING THAT IT IS NOW. AB A PERSON WOULD COME AND THEY WOULD. COMPLETE THIS GUY AFFIDAVIT OF REGISTRATION WHICH IS ALSO PART OF THE ABOUT PROVISIONAL AND BELOW. FOR A CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION EXPERIENCE AYE THEY WOULDN'T BE SENT A VOTER REGISTRATION CARD AFTERWARDS SO THERE'S AND I KNOW. AND AND I'VE JUST. AND A NOTABLY HERE IMPOSTER COUNTY WE DON'T DO THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE VOTER COMPLETED VOTER REGISTRATION CARD WHEN THEY'RE THERE. IF THEY NEED TO FOR IT IF THEY COME IN FOR PROVISIONAL. VOTING EXPERIENCE. MOST THE TIME IF WE CAN SEE THAT THE PERSON WAS ISSUED ABOUT REGISTRY EXUDING A VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT AND JUST NEED A REPLACEMENT VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT. THEY DON'T NEED DIFFERENT IF A LOT OF VOTER REGISTRATION CARD SO THAT I THINK THAT THE STREAMLINING OF THE PROCESS. YOU'RE YOU'RE ENVISIONING A PROCESS THAT REQUIRES MORE PAPERWORK AND I THINK THAT GUY. YOU'RE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IS A A PROCESS THAT REQUIRES LESS PAPERWORK BUT SEAT REALLY. BUT I APPRECIATE ON INTO MY CONCERN IS AND I THINK WE ARE KIND OF TALKING AROUND EACH OTHER IS OKAY SO IF THE TRADITIONAL AND BALK OF PROVINCIAL BALLOTS ARE THE TWO CATEGORIES WE BOTH AGREED ON. AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE NOT TURNED IN THEIR VIVIANE AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE I CHOSEN TO GO TO A DIFFERENT PRECINCT. WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD WE NEED PROVISIONAL BALLOT AND THEN TAKE THE DOUBLE DUTY OF BEING A VOTER REGISTRATION WOULD HAVE F. PERFECTLY GOOD VOTER REGISTRATION FORM? A. WELL BECAUSE I BUT SAY. LET'S ENVISIONED THIS PROCESS WHERE I'D THE PERSON AT I NEEDS TO COME IN AND COMPLETE A PROVISIONAL AND PHILIP. YEAH I AND YET THEY FALL IN THAT SITUATION WHERE I THEY ARE PERFECTLY WERE REGISTERED AND THERE'S NO NEED FOR THEM TO UPDATE REGISTRATION. I THEN. THE ENVELOPE YEAH I THAT REQUIRES THE AFFIDAVIT OF REGISTRATION INFORMATION TO BE COMPLETED. DOESN'T NEED TO BE COMPLETED THAT INSTANCE RIGHT SO YOU HAVE A FORM THAT HAS ALL THE INFORMATION ON IT BUT THERE ARE PARTS THAT YOU MAY NOT NEED TO COMPLETE TO BE ABLE TO. VERIFY THAT THAT BALLOT IS GOING TO BE CAST CORRECTLY SO I IN THAT SENSE I. THE PARTS OF THE ENVELOPE THAT NEED TO BE COMPLETED FOR A PERSON THAT JUST NEEDS A VOTE BY MAIL BECAUSE THEY NEVER RECEIVED IT OR THEY LOST IT OR THEY'VE. MISSED MARK DEBT AND THE NEED OF A SECOND. I CAN BE COMPLETED AND THOSE PEOPLE THAT NEED THE ACT OF THE. FORM FOR AN AFFIDAVIT OF REGISTRATION CAN COMPLETE THE ENTIRE PART OF THE AND. OKAY SO I'M WITH ME IN MY OWN TIME AM MIGHT MY ONLY COMMENT IS I I RESPECT AND UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO MY CONCERN IS IS WHEN WE ACTUALLY GO TO THE REGISTRAR OF VOTERS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT A TRADITIONAL R. O. V. ANY GIVEN TME HAS MAYBE THIRTY TO FORTY EMPLOYEES DURING THE YEAR AND THE MONEY COMES ELECTION TIME THEY HAVE MAYBE SIX HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. AND ALLOW THOSE EMPLOYEES HAVE FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO AN HOUR AND A HALF WORTH OF TRAINING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION WHEN THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AND PROCESSING PROVISIONAL BALLOTS IF YOU'VE EVER GONE THROUGH THAT I'M SURE YOU HAVE. THAT YOU'VE EVER SAT THERE I STOOD THERE FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS AND WATCHED AS THEY GO THROUGH WHEN THEY JUST BASICALLY HAVE OF SOMEONE TRAINED WITH FORTY FIVE MINUTES WORTH OF EXPERIENCE MAKING TERMINATION COUNT DON'T COUNT. COUNT DON'T COUNT GOES THROUGH FOUR DIFFERENT TIMES DEPENDING ON BUT THE PROCESS IS THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL ROV. BUT THAT'S MY POINT YOU HAVE FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT PROCESSES AND TO TAKE A PROVISIONAL BALLOT THAT ARE READY IT'S EXTREMELY CHALLENGING FOR AN RV TO PROCESS ACCURATELY AND THEN ADDED THAT EXTRA DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THEY ARE READY A REGISTERED OR SHOULD BE REGISTERED. I THINK YOU'RE PUTTING A LITTLE MORE BURDEN THAN KEEPING IT STREAMLINED ON A TRADITIONAL REGISTRATION FORM WHERE THEY KNOW WHAT THEIR SINGLE SOURCE RESPONSIBILITY IS ON THAT PARTICULAR FORM. I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A POTENTIAL AREA OF. MISUNDERSTANDING A MISTAKE NOT INTENTIONALLY BUT CERTAINLY. BASED ON THE LEVEL EXPERIENCE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WILL BE PROCESSING THESE BALLOTS. I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE WHAT YOU'RE ATTEMPTING TO ACHIEVE HERE AND I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE COMPLICATING THE SYSTEM EVEN MORE THAN IT HAS. THANK YOU FOR THE FEEDBACK AND THE COLLOQUY IT'S ACTUALLY. SOME HASN'T BEEN REYES THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS SO. I DO APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND CENTER SO WE GOT TO CLOSE. SURE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AT DEPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION I I DO THINK THAT THIS IS A MEASURE THAT WILL STREAMLINE THE CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION PROCESS FOR VOTERS. AS WELL AS FOR ELECTIONS OFFICIALS IF THERE ARE COMPLICATIONS I'M ASSUMING Y. HERE BACK. FROM OUR FROM OUR CLERKS AND AND REGISTRARS. ABOUT THAT AND CAN.
