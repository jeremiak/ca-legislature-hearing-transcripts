AND SO THEN THE FUND AT THE END

00:39:02.606 --> 00:39:04.775
OF NINETEEN TWENTY THE BALANCE

00:39:04.842 --> 00:39:07.411
IS ACTUALLY TEN PUT LITTLE OVER

00:39:07.478 --> 00:39:07.945
IT'S ALMOST TEN POINT SIX

00:39:08.012 --> 00:39:09.780
MILLION.

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:11.782
SO WHETHER STILL IS A STRUCTURAL

00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:14.085
IMBALANCE WITH THE EXPENDITURES

00:39:14.151 --> 00:39:17.588
EXCEEDING THE REVENUES.

00:39:17.655 --> 00:39:19.957
WE HAVE SOME TIME TO SEE HOW THE

00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:21.992
MAIL MIL TAX AND EVERYTHING

00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:25.696
WORKS OUT IT'S WITHIN A 5% --

00:39:25.763 --> 00:39:27.798
TOLERANCE LEVEL [inaudible]

00:39:27.865 --> 00:39:31.302
AND JUST. TO GIVE YOU SOME SOME

00:39:31.368 --> 00:39:33.237
CONTEXT ON THAT LARGE IT SEEMS

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:34.772
LIKE A LARGE --

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:36.574
PRIOR YEAR ADJUSTMENT THAT'S

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.042
BASED ON TWO YEARS.

00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:41.746
AND BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF

00:39:41.812 --> 00:39:43.347
OKAY CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG

00:39:43.414 --> 00:39:45.116
BECAUSE IT IT STARTED BOGGLING

00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:46.350
MY MIND.

00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:49.587
THE WAIT THE THE MILL TAX WHERE

00:39:49.653 --> 00:39:52.223
MIL FEE IS CALCULATED.

00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:55.926
IS NOT BASED ON A CALENDAR A

00:39:55.993 --> 00:39:58.362
YEAR SO IT'S IT HAS A MARCH CUT

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:00.030
OFF DATE.

00:40:00.097 --> 00:40:01.632
SO TRYING.

00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:04.635
TO COORDINATE THAT AND ROLL OVER

00:40:04.702 --> 00:40:07.004
INTO THE NEW FISCAL SYSTEM IT

00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:10.908
WAS A TIMING ISSUE.

00:40:10.975 --> 00:40:12.576
CAN YOU GIVE ME THE UPDATED

00:40:12.643 --> 00:40:15.513
NUMBERS THEN YOU SAY FLOW.

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:16.113
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THERE'S AN

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.281
ADJUSTMENT OF EIGHT POINT NINE

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:18.916
SO RIGHT SORT OF THE NEW NUMBER

00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:20.518
SO THAT GIVES --

00:40:20.584 --> 00:40:22.820
A RESERVE OF TWENTY POINT SEVEN

00:40:22.887 --> 00:40:28.192
MILLION. TWENTY TWENTY POINT.

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:34.431
SEVEN AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

00:40:34.498 --> 00:40:35.065
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LOOKS LIKE IT

00:40:35.132 --> 00:40:36.100
WOULD BE A THIRTEEN POINT

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:37.501
ROUGHLY THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN

00:40:37.568 --> 00:40:40.971
MILLION.

00:40:41.038 --> 00:40:43.040
AND THEN NINETEEN TWENTY IS TEN

00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:44.508
POINT SIX CORRECT.

00:40:44.575 --> 00:40:47.011
SO WE LOST ABOUT TEN MILLION IN

00:40:47.077 --> 00:40:49.079
THE TWO YEAR PERIOD AND PART OF

00:40:49.146 --> 00:40:51.515
THIS TOO IS DANIEL SEE THIS IN

00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:53.684
OTHER BUDGETS AS WELL WHEN WE

00:40:53.751 --> 00:40:58.022
HAVE THE THE PENSION PREPAYMENT.

00:40:58.088 --> 00:40:59.957
THIS IS THIS IS PAYING BACK THAT.

00:41:00.024 --> 00:41:01.025
SO IT'S HITTING ALL OF THE

00:41:01.091 --> 00:41:03.460
SPECIAL FUNDS --

00:41:03.527 --> 00:41:04.929
OFF ALL FUNDS ALL THE WAY AROUND

00:41:04.995 --> 00:41:06.330
ACTUALLY HOW OFTEN DOES THE

00:41:06.397 --> 00:41:07.665
DEPARTMENT FORECAST FUTURE

00:41:07.731 --> 00:41:09.533
REVENUES AND HOW MANY YEARS

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.402
AHEAD.

00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:14.572
DOESN'T DEPARTMENTS PROJECT.

00:41:14.638 --> 00:41:17.208
WE HAD --

00:41:17.274 --> 00:41:20.110
LESLIE YOU MAY WANT TO COMMIT TO

00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:22.146
THAT ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT.

00:41:22.213 --> 00:41:23.214
I THINK WE PROJECT AT LEAST TWO

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.550
YEARS OUT AND MAYBE --

00:41:26.617 --> 00:41:27.151
THREE WESLEY CAN ADDRESS THAT

00:41:27.218 --> 00:41:29.653
FOR SURE.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:30.454
HI LESLIE FORD --

00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:31.622
I'M THE FISCAL OFFICER AT THE

00:41:31.689 --> 00:41:33.190
DEPARTMENT --

00:41:33.257 --> 00:41:37.261
GENERALLY REYES WE FORECAST A

00:41:37.328 --> 00:41:40.764
FIVE YEAR FUND CONDITION.

00:41:40.831 --> 00:41:42.399
SEE FORECAST FIVE YEARS OUT.

00:41:42.466 --> 00:41:43.801
AND WHEN YOU FORECAST TO FIVE

00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:45.436
YEARS OUT DID YOU HAVE AN IDEA

00:41:45.502 --> 00:41:47.037
THAT YOU WERE TWO YEARS BEHIND

00:41:47.104 --> 00:41:50.341
ON THIS ALL MALE OR THE MILL TAX.

00:41:50.407 --> 00:41:52.743
CALCULATION IT'S IT'S HARD TO

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:53.611
UNDERSTAND.

00:41:53.677 --> 00:41:55.479
AND ALMOST NINE MILLION

00:41:55.546 --> 00:41:56.881
ADJUSTMENT.

00:41:56.947 --> 00:41:57.982
THERE WOULD BE FROM TWO YEARS

00:41:58.048 --> 00:42:00.050
PRIOR.

00:42:00.117 --> 00:42:02.887
SO HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT --

00:42:02.953 --> 00:42:05.222
WAS WHAT OCCURRED WAS WHAT --

00:42:05.289 --> 00:42:07.491
JULIE ON I HAD SPOKEN TO IS THAT

00:42:07.558 --> 00:42:09.960
WHEN WE TRANSFERRED OVER FROM --

00:42:10.027 --> 00:42:10.461
THAT CAL STAR SYSTEM THE

00:42:10.527 --> 00:42:12.930
ACCOUNTING SO.

00:42:12.997 --> 00:42:14.598
THAT'S WHERE IT APPEARED IN THE

00:42:14.665 --> 00:42:15.933
TRANSITION SO THE WAY WE

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.534
REVENUES WERE RECORDED IN ONE

00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:19.436
SYSTEM WAS DIFFERENT AND IN THE

00:42:19.503 --> 00:42:20.471
FISCAL SYSTEMS.

00:42:20.537 --> 00:42:22.439
WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE EIGHT POINT

00:42:22.506 --> 00:42:26.010
NINE MILLION BACK TO THE PATENT.

00:42:26.076 --> 00:42:27.478
THAT'S A LARGE ADJUSTMENT.

00:42:27.544 --> 00:42:30.614
BUT THEN FROM THERE.

00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:31.282
THERE WAS A SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR

00:42:31.348 --> 00:42:34.318
DEFICIT THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND

00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:36.153
IT CONTINUES.

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.188
SO THERE'S CLEARLY A STRUCTURAL

00:42:38.255 --> 00:42:40.858
IMBALANCE IN THE DEPARTMENT.

00:42:40.925 --> 00:42:42.693
HOW IS HOW ARE YOU PLANNING FOR

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.395
THE FUTURE SO THAT YOU DON'T END

00:42:44.461 --> 00:42:46.630
UP IN THE RENT?

00:42:46.697 --> 00:42:48.365
SO WE HAVE BEEN MONITORING THE

00:42:48.432 --> 00:42:49.867
FUND OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS

00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:51.235
AND WE HAVE BEEN PAYING

00:42:51.302 --> 00:42:52.670
ATTENTION TO THAT STRUCTURAL

00:42:52.736 --> 00:42:54.972
IMBALANCE AND MAKING SURE THAT --

00:42:55.039 --> 00:42:57.241
WE ARE --

00:42:57.308 --> 00:42:58.609
MONITORING THE MAIL.

00:42:58.676 --> 00:43:00.144
I'M SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:02.780
BESIDES MONITORING WHAT IS BEING

00:43:02.846 --> 00:43:04.415
DONE SPECIFICALLY.

00:43:04.481 --> 00:43:06.350
BECAUSE MONITORING.

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:09.486
STILL GIVES US FROM TWENTY DOWN

00:43:09.553 --> 00:43:11.188
TO THIRTEEN DOWN TO TEN AND

00:43:11.255 --> 00:43:13.457
WE'RE GOING IN A DOWNWARD SPIRAL.

00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:15.559
AND IN JUST A FEW YEARS I

00:43:15.626 --> 00:43:16.593
THOUGHT IS GOING TO BE IN ONE

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.395
YEAR BUT NOW WITH TEN POINT SIX

00:43:18.462 --> 00:43:19.697
IT'LL TAKE A LITTLE LONGER.

00:43:19.763 --> 00:43:21.031
BUT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE HEADING TO

00:43:21.098 --> 00:43:22.266
THE RED.

00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:25.436
WHAT IS BEING DONE TO PLAN TO

00:43:25.502 --> 00:43:27.237
NOT JUST MONITOR BUT TO PLAN TO

00:43:27.304 --> 00:43:28.472
MAKE SURE YOU DON'T END UP IN

00:43:28.539 --> 00:43:31.275
THE REST?

00:43:31.342 --> 00:43:31.875
AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:32.977
SAYING IT IS CONCERNING WHEN YOU

00:43:33.043 --> 00:43:34.178
LOOK WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT BUT I

00:43:34.244 --> 00:43:35.846
THINK THE MYUNDERSTANDING IS

00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:37.014
BEEN NOT BEEN WITH THE

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:38.749
DEPARTMENT NOW FOR THREE ALMOST

00:43:38.816 --> 00:43:39.283
THREE YEARS.

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:40.951
MY UNDERSTANDING HAS BEEN THAT

00:43:41.018 --> 00:43:43.053
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR US TO RUN

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.655
AT THIS TYPE OF STRUCTURAL --

00:43:44.722 --> 00:43:46.390
DEFICIENCY IT'S NOT IT'S NOT

00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:48.125
UNUSUAL TO HAVE THE BALANCE

00:43:48.192 --> 00:43:49.727
GOING DOWN --

00:43:49.793 --> 00:43:53.630
WE HAVE WE THINGS THAT WE DO IN

00:43:53.697 --> 00:43:55.466
OUR OFFICE IS PLAN YEARS AHEAD

00:43:55.532 --> 00:43:56.767
STRATEGICALLY.

00:43:56.834 --> 00:43:58.068
AND WE LOOK AT WHAT TYPE OF

00:43:58.135 --> 00:43:59.970
PROGRAMS WE CAN OFFER AND WHAT

00:44:00.037 --> 00:44:02.940
TYPE OF THAT MONEY WE MAY HAVE

00:44:03.007 --> 00:44:04.742
TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL

00:44:04.808 --> 00:44:06.410
PROGRAMS IN THE OFFICE --

00:44:06.477 --> 00:44:07.778
WE WILL BE MONITORING THAT VERY

00:44:07.845 --> 00:44:09.446
CLOSELY THE SPENDING OF THOSE

00:44:09.513 --> 00:44:11.115
TYPES OF ODD --

00:44:11.181 --> 00:44:13.050
MATTERS THAT BASICALLY WE LIKE

00:44:13.117 --> 00:44:14.952
TO HAVE THAT ARE NOT NECESSARY

00:44:15.019 --> 00:44:15.919
TO THE CORE OPERATIONS OF THE

00:44:15.986 --> 00:44:17.354
PROGRAM SO THAT WILL WORK WILL

00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:18.655
BE HAVE TO WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT

00:44:18.722 --> 00:44:20.290
THAT VERY CLOSELY AS WE MOVE

00:44:20.357 --> 00:44:21.925
FORWARD TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T

00:44:21.992 --> 00:44:23.460
RUN INTO PROBLEMS.

00:44:23.527 --> 00:44:26.096
WHO IS IT IN THE DEPARTMENT THAT

00:44:26.163 --> 00:44:28.966
WOULD BE LOOKING AT THIS?

00:44:29.033 --> 00:44:31.268
AND WOOD SOUNDS OF THE ALARM

00:44:31.335 --> 00:44:33.237
SAYING THIS DOES NOT LOOK GOOD

00:44:33.303 --> 00:44:34.605
WHETHER WE LOOK AT THE NUMBERS

00:44:34.671 --> 00:44:38.175
BEFORE GOING FROM.

00:44:38.242 --> 00:44:38.776
FOURTEEN TO SEVEN TO THREE TO

00:44:38.842 --> 00:44:41.645
FOUR AND NOW IT'S TWENTY TWO

00:44:41.712 --> 00:44:42.279
THIRTEEN TO SIX THERE IS A THAT

00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:43.280
THE IT'S AND WE'RE NOT HEADED IN

00:44:43.347 --> 00:44:44.348
THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:46.417
THE NUMBERS THAT YOU SAW BEFORE

00:44:46.483 --> 00:44:49.053
WAS ACTUALLY NOT OUR DPR FUND

00:44:49.119 --> 00:44:50.654
THOSE NUMBERS WERE OUR OUR

00:44:50.721 --> 00:44:52.156
REGULAR RAZOR.

00:44:52.222 --> 00:44:53.190
WHEN I WAS AROUND REGISTRATION

00:44:53.257 --> 00:44:55.459
FIND AND SO IT DIDN'T COVER ALL

00:44:55.526 --> 00:44:57.795
OF OUR FUNDS ACTUALLY SO THERE

00:44:57.861 --> 00:45:00.364
WERE SOME ISSUES THERE --

00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:02.766
BUT WE HAVE OF COURSE WE HAVE

00:45:02.833 --> 00:45:04.835
OUR PHYSICAL CHIEF WHO'S HERE WE

00:45:04.902 --> 00:45:06.603
HAVE AT THE DIRECTOR WHENEVER

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:08.105
THE NEW DIRECTORS NINE WILL

00:45:08.172 --> 00:45:09.106
CERTAINLY BE LOOKING AT THE FIND

00:45:09.173 --> 00:45:10.441
I LOOK AT THE FINE I'M THE CHIEF

00:45:10.507 --> 00:45:11.942
DEPUTY DIRECTOR NORMALLY AND I

00:45:12.009 --> 00:45:13.510
LOOK AT THE FUND --

00:45:13.577 --> 00:45:15.245
WE HAVE WE WATCH THE BUDGET FUND

00:45:15.312 --> 00:45:16.480
CLOSELY --

00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:19.450
WE HAVE REGULAR MEETINGS ON THE

00:45:19.516 --> 00:45:24.488
SPENDING THE AND I PERHAPS I'M

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:27.324
ASKING THE RIGHT WRONG QUESTION.

00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:29.460
BESIDES MONITORING WHAT IS BEING

00:45:29.526 --> 00:45:31.395
DONE TO PLAN.

00:45:31.462 --> 00:45:32.362
BECAUSE WE'RE HEADED IN THE

00:45:32.429 --> 00:45:34.031
WRONG DIRECTION.

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:36.100
THAT IS MY QUESTION NOT JUST THE

00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:37.401
MONITORING BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU

00:45:37.468 --> 00:45:39.169
SAW THE NUMBERS AND YOU CAN

00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:39.803
MONITOR AND SEE THAT IT'S GOING

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:40.938
DOWN.

00:45:41.004 --> 00:45:42.806
WHAT SPECIFICALLY IS BEING DONE

00:45:42.873 --> 00:45:44.641
TO PLAN SO THAT THE NUMBERS

00:45:44.708 --> 00:45:46.310
DON'T GO DOWN BUT RATHER GO UP

00:45:46.376 --> 00:45:48.212
OR REMAIN STABLE SO THAT WE

00:45:48.278 --> 00:45:49.246
DON'T HAVE?

00:45:49.313 --> 00:45:51.715
SUCH A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE.

00:45:51.782 --> 00:45:54.852
WE WE REVIEW OUR FEES --

00:45:54.918 --> 00:45:56.453
ON A REGULAR BASIS --

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:59.089
AT THIS POINT WE DO NOT INTEND

00:45:59.156 --> 00:46:00.190
TO INCREASE THE FEES BUT THAT'S

00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:01.959
AN OPTION SHOULD WE NEED TO DO

00:46:02.025 --> 00:46:04.361
THAT WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IS

00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:05.462
TO BE ABLE TO CURB THE SPENDING

00:46:05.529 --> 00:46:06.997
IN THE DEPARTMENT --

00:46:07.064 --> 00:46:09.233
AND NOT HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

00:46:09.299 --> 00:46:11.001
ADJUSTMENT OF THOSE FEES BUT

00:46:11.068 --> 00:46:12.169
CERTAINLY THAT IS ALWAYS A

00:46:12.236 --> 00:46:13.937
POSSIBILITY OUR REGISTRATION

00:46:14.004 --> 00:46:15.272
FEES -- ARE

00:46:15.339 --> 00:46:16.840
ADJUSTED TO SUPPORT OUR

00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:19.042
REGISTRATION PROGRAM SO EVEN

00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.710
THOUGH IT ALL GOES IN OUR DEEP

00:46:19.776 --> 00:46:21.345
YOUR FUN WE REALLY LOOK AT WHAT

00:46:21.411 --> 00:46:22.613
THE COST TO THE REGISTRATION

00:46:22.679 --> 00:46:23.881
PROGRAM IS.

00:46:23.947 --> 00:46:24.781
AND WHAT WE HAVE MANY WHAT THE

00:46:24.848 --> 00:46:26.216
FEE AMOUNT IS WE'RE GETTING IN

00:46:26.283 --> 00:46:28.619
ON THAT PROGRAM --

00:46:28.685 --> 00:46:31.989
OUR MILL ASSESSMENT --

00:46:32.055 --> 00:46:34.791
HAS HAS BEEN --

00:46:34.858 --> 00:46:37.361
THAT'S FORCE 80% OF OUR BUDGET --

00:46:37.427 --> 00:46:39.830
WE ARE NOW AT THE MAX ON THE

00:46:39.897 --> 00:46:40.430
MILLS HAS SPENT TWO POINT ONE

00:46:40.497 --> 00:46:41.765
SANTA -- A

00:46:41.832 --> 00:46:43.967
ON EVERY DOLLAR SOLD BUT THAT

00:46:44.034 --> 00:46:45.569
DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN WE

00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:46.637
COULDN'T COME BACK TO TRY TO

00:46:46.703 --> 00:46:47.337
RISE THAT SHOULD BECOME

00:46:47.404 --> 00:46:49.239
NECESSARY ONE OF THE CONCERNS WE

00:46:49.306 --> 00:46:50.707
HAVE OF COURSE IS MOVING FORWARD

00:46:50.774 --> 00:46:52.442
WITH PROGRAMS TO INSTITUTE SAFER

00:46:52.509 --> 00:46:54.077
ALTERNATIVES AND INTEGRATED PEST

00:46:54.144 --> 00:46:55.445
MANAGEMENT MEASURES.

00:46:55.512 --> 00:46:56.513
SO AT SOME POINT IT MIGHT BECOME

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.882
NECESSARY FOR US TO COME BACK

00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:01.118
AND LOOK AT THE MILL ASSESSMENT.

00:47:01.185 --> 00:47:03.320
VERY GOOD IF I MAY I WOULD LIKE

00:47:03.387 --> 00:47:06.023
YOU SAY THAT IT IS NOT UNUSUAL

00:47:06.089 --> 00:47:07.357
TO HAVE THE NUMBERS GO DOWN.

00:47:07.424 --> 00:47:09.259
WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR

00:47:09.326 --> 00:47:10.160
ME.

00:47:10.227 --> 00:47:12.563
MAYBE GOING BACK TEN YEARS IT'S

00:47:12.629 --> 00:47:13.664
SO WE CAN LOOK AT IT AND I

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:16.867
RECOGNIZE THAT IT WILL BE.

00:47:16.934 --> 00:47:18.969
CALCULATED DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE

00:47:19.036 --> 00:47:23.707
OF THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE THE OF

00:47:23.774 --> 00:47:24.942
THE PERIOD --

00:47:25.008 --> 00:47:27.945
THAT YOU IT'S NOW BEEN CHANGED --

00:47:28.011 --> 00:47:30.614
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT IF

00:47:30.681 --> 00:47:32.182
I MAY CERTAINLY TO GET A BETTER

00:47:32.249 --> 00:47:34.017
IDEA OF THIS BECAUSE THIS IS

00:47:34.084 --> 00:47:35.552
ALARMING TO ME.

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:37.187
I UNDERSTAND WE WILL CERTAINLY

00:47:37.254 --> 00:47:38.155
PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT.

00:47:38.222 --> 00:47:39.656
THANK YOU WELL IT'S A LIME

ALARMING TO THE CHAIRS WELL

00:47:40.557 --> 00:47:41.892
THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT THE ISSUE

00:47:41.959 --> 00:47:43.527
UP IN THE FIRST PLACE AND ASK

00:47:43.594 --> 00:47:47.431
YOU TO ADDRESS THAT AND WHILE

00:47:47.497 --> 00:47:50.300
THE SITUATION MIGHT BE NOT BE

00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:54.304
DIRE IN THE IMMEDIATE NEAR TERM --

00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:54.938
THE AT THE ACCOUNT APPEARS TO GO

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:56.740
READ -- IN A

00:47:56.807 --> 00:47:58.108
RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME

00:47:58.175 --> 00:48:02.512
I THINK IT'S TWENTY TWENTY OR

00:48:02.579 --> 00:48:03.847
TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE SO

00:48:03.914 --> 00:48:04.448
TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS PROBABLY

00:48:04.514 --> 00:48:05.616
RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

00:48:05.682 --> 00:48:08.151
IN TERMS OF A PLANNING HORIZON

00:48:08.218 --> 00:48:10.087
AND THE QUESTION --

00:48:10.153 --> 00:48:12.122
THAT'S BEING POSED IS WHAT'S THE

00:48:12.189 --> 00:48:13.957
PLAN TO ADDRESS THAT THEIR

00:48:14.024 --> 00:48:15.792
FRANKLY APPEARS TO BE NO PLAN

00:48:15.859 --> 00:48:20.230
RIGHT NOW OTHER THAN TO WATCH IT --

00:48:20.297 --> 00:48:22.766
WHEN ASKED --

00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:24.468
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT THE PLAN IS

00:48:24.534 --> 00:48:27.371

00:48:27.437 --> 00:48:29.873
REYES FEES OR WE COULD CUT COSTS

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.208
THE FACT YOU KNOW TO SORT OF

00:48:31.275 --> 00:48:32.509
GETTING TO THE HEART OF WHAT YOU

00:48:32.576 --> 00:48:33.610
SAID BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT A

00:48:33.677 --> 00:48:34.511
PLAN.

00:48:34.578 --> 00:48:36.079
THE THOSE ARE THE TWO OPTIONS

00:48:36.146 --> 00:48:36.947
THAT THAT --

00:48:37.014 --> 00:48:38.782
THAT YOU HAVE A AND THAT ANY

00:48:38.849 --> 00:48:40.350
DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN --

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:42.219
A IN ANY GIVEN SITUATION WHEN

00:48:42.286 --> 00:48:43.954
THERE'S GOING TO BE A A

00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:46.556
SHORTFALL SO --

00:48:46.623 --> 00:48:48.292
WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN

00:48:48.358 --> 00:48:51.128

00:48:53.163 --> 00:48:54.631
HEARING SO THAT THERE'S AMPLE

00:48:54.698 --> 00:48:57.401
TIME TO REVIEW IT I'M --

00:48:57.467 --> 00:49:01.204
A LITTLE BIT FRUSTRATED THAT

00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:03.340
THIS YESTERDAY AFTER HAVING

00:49:03.407 --> 00:49:06.943
INQUIRED ABOUT THAT ABOUT IT --

00:49:09.379 --> 00:49:11.481
BIT MORE LEAD TIME IN ORDER TO

EVALUATE THESE THINGS AND AND TO

00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:15.218
I WOULD LIKE THE LA --

00:49:15.285 --> 00:49:17.154

IS -- I

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.162
THINK IT TO BECOME A RECURRENT

00:49:25.228 --> 00:49:26.263
THEME --

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:27.197
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

00:49:27.264 --> 00:49:29.232
DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE ACCOUNTS

00:49:29.299 --> 00:49:30.767

RED AWARE THERE'S BEEN BORROWING

00:49:32.035 --> 00:49:33.603
AND MOVING MONEY AROUND.

AND IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE

00:49:35.339 --> 00:49:36.840
GONNA TRY TO GET TO THE BOTTOM

00:49:36.907 --> 00:49:39.910

THOUSAND HOMES THAT NEEDED TO BE

00:59:18.154 --> 00:59:19.522
CLEANED UP AND THAT THAT COST

00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:20.690
COULD BE CLOSE TO A BILLION

STRUCTURAL DEFICIT.

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:14.604
WITHIN THE HARD WORK OF OUR OUR

01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:16.773
BATTERY FEET OUT THERE WE LOOKED

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:17.940

SOME POINT.

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:31.087
BECAUSE OF THE BATTERY FEE FUN

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:34.957

HEADLINES BUT YOU'RE REALLY

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:53.443
GOING TO LEAVE THIS BEHIND A

01:01:53.509 --> 01:01:54.877
COUPLE OF YEARS.

01:01:54.944 --> 01:01:56.813
THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN HARD IT

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:57.980
HAS IT IT'S BEEN HARD FOR THE

01:01:58.047 --> 01:02:00.483
TNC WERE LEARNING ALONG THE WAY --

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.151
WE NEVER EXPECTED TO BE PERFECT

01:02:02.218 --> 01:02:03.419
BUT WHEN WE SEE THE DEPARTMENT

01:02:03.486 --> 01:02:05.321
OF FINANCE PAYING THESE GAMES H.

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:09.358
AS ADDS TO OUR DISTRUST.

01:02:09.425 --> 01:02:10.326
IT CONTINUES TO MAKE US FEEL

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:10.960

PASS A FEE A TWO THIRDS FEE THAT

01:02:14.664 --> 01:02:16.065
HAD TO MEAN THAT IN THE DECADE.

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:17.033
PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT WAS

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.334
IMPOSSIBLE WERE CRAZY PARTICULAR

JUST KEEP THIS OPEN BUT WE NEED

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:26.275

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:41.050
THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT'S

01:03:41.117 --> 01:03:42.251
NECESSARY AND WE WANTED TO

XCELERATED.

01:03:43.386 --> 01:03:45.521
BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:03:45.588 --> 01:03:48.057

01:03:58.734 --> 01:03:59.635
SOMETHING ELSE.

01:03:59.702 --> 01:04:02.171
AND AND WHY NOT GIVE US THE

01:04:02.238 --> 01:04:03.739
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND USE

GARCIA JUST MADE IS THAT AN

01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:42.511
ACCURATE REFLECTION OF WHAT'S

01:04:42.578 --> 01:04:43.713
GOING ON WITH THAT ACCOUNT.

01:04:43.779 --> 01:04:45.948

THEM WE ARE SEEING SOME TRICKLES

01:10:08.537 --> 01:10:10.205
WE ARE SEEING PEOPLE THAT WALK

01:10:10.272 --> 01:10:11.640
BY SEE SOMEBODY IN THE

01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:12.441
NEIGHBORHOOD GETTING CLEANED UP

01:10:12.508 --> 01:10:13.342
AND SAY.

01:10:13.409 --> 01:10:14.810
ASK ABOUT IT AND ARE GETTING

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:16.779
SAMPLE BUT THE SAMPLING NUMBERS

01:10:16.845 --> 01:10:18.380
ARE DWINDLING --

01:10:18.447 --> 01:10:19.481
BUT WE DO HAVE A SAMPLING

01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:21.684
CONTRACTOR HANG ON HAND AND IF

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:24.153
ANYBODY COMES TO US AS LONG AS

AREA WE WILL SAMPLE THEM.

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:31.293
SO RIGHT NOW WE ARE EIGHTY FIVE

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.062
TWENTY TWO OF OUR EXPERIENCE HAS

01:10:33.128 --> 01:10:35.130
BEEN THAT THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED OR

01:10:35.197 --> 01:10:36.532
SO PROPERTIES MAY OR MAY NOT.

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:38.233
COME INTO THE FOLD --

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.369
BUT AS LONG AS WE ARE IN THE

01:10:40.436 --> 01:10:42.104
FIELD IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY

WE WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER THOSE

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.241
SAMPLING.

01:10:46.308 --> 01:10:47.643
SO THEY NEVER COME INTO THE FOLD

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:49.211
WHEN DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT YOU

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:51.447
WILL COMPLETE THE SAMPLING.

01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:52.514
SO IF THEY NEVER COME INTO THE

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:55.250
FOLD WE WILL WE WILL JUST --

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:57.353
LEAVE IT AT THAT NUMBER WHATEVER

01:10:57.419 --> 01:11:00.723
THAT NUMBER IS WE ME MAY REACHED

01:11:00.789 --> 01:11:02.224
EIGHTY SIX HUNDRED WE MAY REACH --

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:03.892
NINE THOUSAND BUT OUR EXPERIENCE

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:04.827
HAS SHOWN THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS

01:11:04.893 --> 01:11:07.096
GOING TO BE FEW PEOPLE THAT DO

01:11:07.162 --> 01:11:08.731
NOT WANT TO PARTAKE.

01:11:08.797 --> 01:11:10.666
BUT THAT NUMBER CAN CHANGE AS

01:11:10.733 --> 01:11:12.534
PROPERTY OWNERSHIP CHANGES AND

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:14.103
WE WILL CONTINUE OUR OUTREACH

01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:15.971
REACH OUT TO THESE BEYOND WHAT

01:11:16.038 --> 01:11:18.474
WE'VE DONE THUS FAR.

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:20.509
CAN I ADD ON THAT I MEAN I AND

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:21.810
IN ALL FAIRNESS I KNOW THE TSC

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:22.778
AND COMMUNITY GROUPS HAVE WORKED

01:11:22.845 --> 01:11:24.246
REALLY HARD TO BRING EVERYONE

01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:25.881
INTO THE FOLD --

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:27.983
AND CONTINUES TO WORK TO DO THAT

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:28.851
INTO THE FALL UNTIL I HAVE A LOT

01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:30.052
OFDECISIONS I WANT TO BE FOR

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:31.220
AND THAT IS THE SPACE WHERE THE

01:11:31.286 --> 01:11:32.454
TSC HAS BEEN WORKING

01:11:32.521 --> 01:11:34.056
AGGRESSIVELY. TO TRY TO CONVINCE

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:35.824
EVERYONE AND ALL THE PROPERTY

01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:39.228
OWNERS CONTINUOUSLY TO COME INTO

01:11:39.294 --> 01:11:40.496
THE FOLD.

01:11:40.562 --> 01:11:41.530
THE NEXT QUESTION IS HOW DOES

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:42.731
DTS YET.

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:44.867
HOW MUCH DOES THE TSC ESTIMATE

01:11:44.933 --> 01:11:46.101
IT WILL COST TO COMPLETE THE

01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:47.369
SAMPLING AND CLEAN UP OF ALL OF

01:11:47.436 --> 01:11:49.672
THE PARCELS THE REQUIRED CLEAN

01:11:49.738 --> 01:11:50.973
UP WITHIN THE PIAA?

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.041
AND SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE

01:11:52.107 --> 01:11:54.610
EXPECT TO SEE IT TIME GENERAL

01:11:54.677 --> 01:11:58.113
FUND LOANS IN FUTURE BUDGETS --

01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:59.682
SO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER --

01:11:59.748 --> 01:12:01.717
OR I'M I'M NOT SURE I DID I WAS

01:12:01.784 --> 01:12:02.685
AT A COMMUNITY MEETING LAST

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:04.486
NIGHT SO I'M MIXING UP MESSAGES

01:12:04.553 --> 01:12:06.789
PERHAPS BUT SIX HUNDRED AND

01:12:06.855 --> 01:12:07.389
SIXTY NINE PARCELS HAVE BEEN

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:10.225
CLEANED UP AS OF MARCH FIFTEENTH --

01:12:10.292 --> 01:12:13.162
WE ARE WE ARE.

01:12:13.228 --> 01:12:14.596
TARGETING A ANTICIPATING

01:12:14.663 --> 01:12:16.832
CLEANING UP UP TO TWENTY FIVE

01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:19.868
HUNDRED PARCELS BY DECEMBER.

01:12:19.935 --> 01:12:21.203
TWENTY TWENTY AND THE CAP YACHTS

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:22.271
THAT --

01:12:22.337 --> 01:12:24.640
CHIEF OF A **** HE SAID.

01:12:24.707 --> 01:12:28.010
WHETHER AND PEOPLE PERMITTING --

01:12:28.077 --> 01:12:30.112
IF NOTHING HAPPENS THAT THAT IS

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:31.180
THE GOAL THAT IS WHERE WE ARE

01:12:31.246 --> 01:12:31.580
GOING.

01:12:31.647 --> 01:12:35.050
THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS HAVE GONE

01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:38.120
UP THE INFLATION THE COST OF

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:40.255
LABOR THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES

01:12:40.322 --> 01:12:42.758
THAT WE BASED THE HUNDRED

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:43.358
SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS.

01:12:43.425 --> 01:12:45.360
LOAN ON WAS --

01:12:45.427 --> 01:12:48.530
WAS BASED ON CONSTRUCTION COSTS

01:12:48.597 --> 01:12:51.166
THAT WERE OF FROM TWO THOUSAND

01:12:51.233 --> 01:12:52.301
FOURTEEN LATE.

01:12:52.367 --> 01:12:53.936
FOURTEEN ARE TWO THOUSAND

01:12:54.002 --> 01:12:54.770
FIFTEEN AND OUR THAT.

01:12:54.837 --> 01:12:58.974
CLEAN UP WAS CONDUCTED BY EXCITE

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:00.075
CONTRACT --

01:13:00.142 --> 01:13:01.176
CONTRACTING --

01:13:01.243 --> 01:13:03.145
ORGANIZATION HAS DIFFERENT

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:04.713
REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTING

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:06.682
THEN EXCITE DOES ARE CONTRACTING

01:13:06.749 --> 01:13:09.284
REQUIREMENTS HAS ADDED SOME COST

01:13:09.351 --> 01:13:11.987
WE HAVE BONDING REQUIREMENTS.

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:13.055
OF WE HAVE --

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:14.923
PREVAILING WAGES THAT WERE ALL

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:16.892
KNOCKED OUT IN THAT ORIGINAL

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:18.494
COST -- AND

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.529
SO THAT HAS ALL ADDED UP AT AS

01:13:20.596 --> 01:13:22.197
OF TODAY.

01:13:22.264 --> 01:13:23.565
WE BELIEVE THIS THAT THAT THE

01:13:23.632 --> 01:13:25.768
AVERAGE PROPERTIES GOING TO COST

01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:26.735
SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:28.370
THIS IS AN AVERAGE BASED ON WHAT

01:13:28.437 --> 01:13:29.938
WE HAVE DONE SO FAR THESE

01:13:30.005 --> 01:13:31.774
NUMBERS DO CHANGE BECAUSE THE

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.075
SIZE OF THE PROPERTY IS

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:34.042
DIFFERENT.

01:13:34.109 --> 01:13:36.578
THE SOMETIMES THE CONFIGURATION

01:13:36.645 --> 01:13:38.514
OF THE PROPERTY IS SUCH THAT IT

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.549
IS ON A HILLSIDE WHERE WE CANNOT

01:13:40.616 --> 01:13:42.951
USE EQUIPMENT WE HAVE TO USE

01:13:43.018 --> 01:13:44.353
MANUAL LABOR THE COST GOES UP.

01:13:44.419 --> 01:13:46.121
SOMETIMES THERE IS THE LAY OUT

01:13:46.188 --> 01:13:48.690
OF THE PROPERTIES SUCH THAT THE

01:13:48.757 --> 01:13:50.259
EQUIPMENT CANNOT PASS BETWEEN

01:13:50.325 --> 01:13:51.827
THE STRUCTURES AND WE HAVE TO

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:53.095
USE MANUAL LABOR AND THE COST

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:54.029
GOES UP.

01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:55.430
SO THESE ARE THINGS THAT THAT

01:13:55.497 --> 01:13:56.031
THAT.

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:57.766
AFFECT THE AVERAGE BUT THAT'S

01:13:57.833 --> 01:13:59.468
WHAT WE ARE BASING ON AND YES

01:13:59.535 --> 01:14:04.039
THERE IS A THERE IS AS I SAID --

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:04.540
EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED PLUS

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:08.410
PROPERTY SAMPLED WE HAVE A ABOUT

01:14:08.477 --> 01:14:08.944
FORTY FOUR HUNDRED THAT'LL

01:14:09.011 --> 01:14:11.680
REMAIN AND THERE WILL NOT GET

01:14:11.747 --> 01:14:12.948
CLEANED UP EVEN AFTER THE

01:14:13.015 --> 01:14:14.516
AUGMENTATION OF SEVENTY FIVE

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:15.984
MILLION DOLLARS --

01:14:16.051 --> 01:14:18.587
THAT WE'LL NEED A FUNDING.

01:14:18.654 --> 01:14:19.588
SO.

01:14:19.655 --> 01:14:22.925
SO THAT I CAN WRITE IN MY NOTES.

01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:24.993
WHAT IS THE ESTIMATE FOR DETAILS

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:25.761
SEE?

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:28.063
NOW TO COMPLETE THE SAMPLING AND

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:30.065
CLEAN UP.

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:31.533
SO THIS IS THIS IS.

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.869
MATH IS NOT MY FORTE BUT I WILL

01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:36.138
TELL YOU IF YOU DO SIXTY TIMES

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:37.873
OF FORTY FOUR HUNDRED THAT IS

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:39.908
WHAT IS AS OF TODAY.

01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:41.977
BUT BUT LIKE I SAID.

01:14:42.044 --> 01:14:44.479
BUT WE'LL SAY MATH IS NOT MY

01:14:44.546 --> 01:14:46.048
FORTE EITHER WE HAVE SOMEBODY

01:14:46.114 --> 01:14:47.482
WHO WHO CAN DO THIS MATH I

01:14:47.549 --> 01:14:49.051
REALLY WOULD LIKE TO PUT DOWN A

01:14:49.117 --> 01:14:50.118
NUMBER.

01:14:50.185 --> 01:14:52.387
AS TO WHAT THE ESTIMATE IS RIGHT

01:14:52.454 --> 01:14:54.356
NOW -- TO

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:56.458
COMPLETE THE SAMPLING AND CLEAN

01:14:56.525 --> 01:15:00.095
UP OF ALL THE PARCELS.

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:02.064
AS A MAY I ADD A A COMMON HERE

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:03.999
PLEASE YOU DON'T MIND --

01:15:04.066 --> 01:15:05.567
THIS IS A QUESTION THAT'S

01:15:05.634 --> 01:15:08.337
PRINTED IN THE AGENDA.

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:11.740
AND SO IT REALLY BEHOOVES --

01:15:11.807 --> 01:15:14.109
EVERYONE WHO APPEARS BEFORE THIS

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:16.111
COMMITTEE TO BE PREPARED TO

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:17.646
ANSWER WITH SOME LEVEL OF

01:15:17.713 --> 01:15:19.381
SPECIFICITY THAT THE THE

01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:20.749
QUESTIONS THAT ARE POSED.

01:15:20.816 --> 01:15:22.284
THAT'S WHY OUR STAFF BECAUSE TO

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:23.852
THE TROUBLE OF PUTTING THOSE

01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:25.487
QUESTIONS IN THERE --

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:31.360
ALL ASSEMBLY MEMBER REYES --

01:15:31.426 --> 01:15:33.028
TO IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER

01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:34.129
JUST SAY YOU DON'T HAVE THE

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:36.765
ANSWER AND YOU KNOW WE EXPECT.

01:15:36.832 --> 01:15:39.201
THAT ANSWER TO BE PROVIDED --

01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:40.602
NOT YOU KNOW AT THE TIME THE

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:42.371
NEXT HEARING BUT IT WELL IN

01:15:42.437 --> 01:15:44.339
ADVANCE OF THE OF THE NEXT

01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:46.375
HEARING WILL THAT.

01:15:46.441 --> 01:15:47.709
YEAH HELP MISTRESS AND WE CAN

01:15:47.776 --> 01:15:48.810
CERTAINLY --

01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:50.746
PROVIDE YOU WITH THE DATA THAT

01:15:50.812 --> 01:15:52.948
WE HAVE AS OF TODAY'S DATE I

01:15:53.015 --> 01:15:56.285
THINK A THE CHALLENGE THAT SUITS

01:15:56.351 --> 01:15:58.954
HAVING IS THAT --

01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:00.355
WE ASSUME WE'RE GOING TO GET

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:01.924
MORE SAMPLING AGREEMENTS BECAUSE

01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.925
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE

01:16:02.991 --> 01:16:05.027
OUT IN THE FIELD --

01:16:05.093 --> 01:16:07.696
AND AND EVEN AS WERE CLEANING WE

01:16:07.763 --> 01:16:09.998
EXPECT SOME --

01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:13.168
PROPERTY OWNERS TO TO SIGN UP

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:14.636
FOR SAMPLING AS THE SEE THE

01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:16.471
THEIR NEIGHBORS PROPERTIES BEING

01:16:16.538 --> 01:16:19.608
REMEDIATED AND THEN WE WERE WERE

01:16:19.675 --> 01:16:21.310
A LITTLE TENTATIVE ON THE PRICE

01:16:21.376 --> 01:16:22.611
PER PROPERTY WE KNOW THAT THAT'S

01:16:22.678 --> 01:16:24.746
CHANGED OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF

01:16:24.813 --> 01:16:26.181
YEARS BECAUSE OF INCREASED.

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:27.783
INFLATION WITH CONSTRUCTION

01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:29.217
COSTS UNDER CROSS ALL

01:16:29.284 --> 01:16:31.086
CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY NOT JUST

01:16:31.153 --> 01:16:32.754
PERTAINING TO THIS AND IN THE

01:16:32.821 --> 01:16:34.589
OTHER AT ELEMENTS THAT NGUYEN IN

01:16:34.656 --> 01:16:35.958
THE UNKNOWNS WHICH ARE THE

01:16:36.024 --> 01:16:37.392
EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION.

01:16:37.459 --> 01:16:39.995
AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

01:16:40.062 --> 01:16:43.699
PROPERTIES TESTAMENT AND AND WE

01:16:43.765 --> 01:16:45.367
WOULD NEED TO QUALIFY IT WITH

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:46.702
THOSE FACTORS THAT WE'VE ALREADY

01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:48.470
DISCUSSED THE AGENDA ASKED FOR

01:16:48.537 --> 01:16:49.905
AND AN ESTIMATE --

01:16:49.972 --> 01:16:52.808
AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT I'M SORRY --

01:16:52.874 --> 01:16:54.343
TO TO INTERJECT HERE BUT THIS IS

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:57.245
JUST A LITTLE BIT FRUSTRATING --

01:16:57.312 --> 01:16:58.981
I'D.

01:16:59.047 --> 01:17:04.920
HEY AND THE ALL WE NLY EXPECT

01:17:04.987 --> 01:17:06.288
PROJECTION AND IF THERE'S A

01:17:06.355 --> 01:17:08.757
TOLERANCE THAT'S PLUS OR MINUS

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:10.592
OF YOU KNOW CERTAIN PERCENTAGES

01:17:10.659 --> 01:17:12.461
JUST TELL US --

01:17:12.527 --> 01:17:14.029
BUT NOT COMING IN WITH ANY

01:17:14.096 --> 01:17:16.331
INFORMATION AT ALL THIS --

01:17:16.398 --> 01:17:20.502
OF FRANKLY A AN UNACCEPTABLE.

01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:21.603
AND I THINK THAT IF IF YOU GIVE

01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:24.006
ESTIMATES YOU CAN SAVE BASED

01:17:24.072 --> 01:17:25.741
UPON THIS NUMBER.

01:17:25.807 --> 01:17:28.143
AND THESE MANY PARCELS WITH THIS

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:30.345
MANY OF THEM HAVING BEEN --

01:17:30.412 --> 01:17:32.681
SAMPLED IT AND THEN YOU CAN

01:17:32.748 --> 01:17:35.283
QUALIFY IT BUT HONESTLY THIS IS

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:38.620
VERY FRUSTRATING. TO BE ABLE TO

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:39.855
TO TO TO FEEL THAT WE CAN VOTE

01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:43.058
ON SOMETHING. FOR ME ANYWAY I'M

01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:45.494
THE NEW KID ON THE BLOCK BUTTO

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.229
TO ASK ME TO VOTE ON SOMETHING

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:48.663
AND WHEN I HAVE MY COLLEAGUE WHO

01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:52.367
KNOWS THIS INSIDE AND OUT HAVING

01:17:52.434 --> 01:17:53.402
THIS LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION.

01:17:53.468 --> 01:17:55.737
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO

01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:58.173
EVER VOTE. TO ON THIS KIND OF A

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.308
BUDGET ITEM WITH NO ESTIMATES

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:02.677
AND AS THE CHAIR HAS INDICATED

01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:03.445
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:04.146
LISTED.

01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:05.347
ON READING THE QUESTION RIGHT

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:08.016
FROM WHAT WAS PROVIDED TO THE

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:10.185
DEPARTMENT I I AM.

01:18:10.252 --> 01:18:11.119
SO AS OF TODAY WHAT IS THE

01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:13.121
NUMBER.

01:18:13.188 --> 01:18:15.123
IT'S WE WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:17.159
HAVE WE WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE

01:18:17.225 --> 01:18:19.261
APPROXIMATELY FORTY FOUR HUNDRED

01:18:19.327 --> 01:18:20.695
ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES.

01:18:20.762 --> 01:18:22.230
THAT ARE --

01:18:22.297 --> 01:18:24.900
HAVE BEEN SAMPLED BETTER BE TO

01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:26.668
THE CLEANUP THRESHOLD OF EIGHTY

01:18:26.735 --> 01:18:28.603
PARTS PER MILLION AND THREE

01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:29.604
HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE PARTS

01:18:29.671 --> 01:18:33.108
PER MILLION WHICH IS --

01:18:33.175 --> 01:18:35.577
WHAT THE ADDITIONAL SEVENTY FIVE

01:18:35.644 --> 01:18:37.279
MILLION WILL WELL I'LL ENABLE US

01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:39.281
TO CLEAN TO AND WE'RE ESTIMATING

01:18:39.347 --> 01:18:41.550
THAT THOSE FORTY FOUR HUNDRED

01:18:41.616 --> 01:18:42.551
PROPERTIES WILL COST

01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:45.220
APPROXIMATELY SIXTY THOUSAND

01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:46.455
DOLLARS PER PROPERTY TO CLEAN?

01:18:46.521 --> 01:18:48.723
IF I MAY INTERJECT DISAPPEAR THE

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:50.559
SIMPLE MATH THAT'S TO OUR SIXTY

01:18:50.625 --> 01:18:51.760
FOUR MILLION DOLLARS

01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:52.060
[inaudible]

01:22:57.305 --> 01:22:58.306
DOLLARS.

01:22:58.373 --> 01:22:59.774
NOT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:22:59.841 --> 01:23:01.343
IF YOU FEEL THAT THE MONEY

COMING INTO THE BATTERY FEE FUND

01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:05.013
IS NOT ENOUGH.

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.381
THERE'S A MUCH BETTER SOLUTION

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:08.216
THAN THIS THIS SHELL GAME THAT

01:23:08.283 --> 01:23:09.684
WE'RE PLAYING LET'S INCREASE THE

THERE FOR SOME OF THOSE FEES --

01:23:14.322 --> 01:23:16.324
THIS IS GONNA BE AN EXPENSIVE

01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:18.593
PROCESS EXCITE IS ONE OF FIFTEEN

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.428
LEGACY SITES WE KNOW WE HAVE

01:23:20.495 --> 01:23:22.464
MORE WE DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUE

01:23:22.530 --> 01:23:23.465
TO DO.

01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:27.302
GENERAL FUND LOANS WEEKLY THAT

01:23:27.369 --> 01:23:31.639
MY THIS BATTERY FEE FUND IT'S A

01:23:31.706 --> 01:23:33.108
FEW THAT WE PAY EVERY THREE TO

01:23:33.174 --> 01:23:34.676
FIVE YEARS AS A FEW THAT I HAD

01:23:34.743 --> 01:23:35.710

I'M WILLING TO PAY THAT THE TO

01:23:40.548 --> 01:23:41.383
FIVE EVERY TWO TO FIVE YEARS

01:23:41.449 --> 01:23:42.684
EVEN EVER LISTEN MY FAULT TO

01:23:42.751 --> 01:23:45.487
MAKE SURE COMPLETED EASE THAT

01:23:45.553 --> 01:23:47.021
DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES.

01:23:47.088 --> 01:23:47.756
AND HAVE BEEN TREATED LIKE

01:23:47.822 --> 01:23:48.990
ALWAYS I'M FOR GENERATIONS HAVE

01:23:49.057 --> 01:23:51.426
A BETTER FUTURE AND SO I WHICH

01:23:51.493 --> 01:23:53.128
IS RECOMMEND THAT WE DO.

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:54.729
A DIFFERENT TYPE OF MATH.

01:23:54.796 --> 01:23:56.064
AND WE THINK ABOUT THIS IN A

01:23:56.131 --> 01:23:58.066
SMARTER WAY SO THAT WE DO HAVE

01:23:58.133 --> 01:23:59.300
GENERAL FUND DOLLARS OUT THERE

01:23:59.367 --> 01:24:00.869
LEFT FOR ALL THE OTHER THINGS WE

01:24:00.935 --> 01:24:01.770
HAVE TO DO.

01:24:01.836 --> 01:24:03.271
AND WE CREATE A MODEL OF HOW TO

01:24:03.338 --> 01:24:06.207
TAKE CARE OF THESE LEGACY THAT

01:24:06.274 --> 01:24:07.709
MAN MADE DISASTERS.

01:24:07.776 --> 01:24:09.444

01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:10.779
MAKE SURE THAT THE GOVERNOR AND

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:12.480
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT

01:24:12.547 --> 01:24:14.449

COMMUNITY.

01:24:23.124 --> 01:24:24.692
THE CLEANUP IS PICKING UP THE

01:24:24.759 --> 01:24:25.827
MORE MONEY WE PUT IN THERE AT

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:27.629
THE FASTER GETS UNDER THE FASTER

01:24:27.695 --> 01:24:29.164
WE CAN DO THE CLEAN UP.

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:31.566
THE THE LEFT SICKNESS AND THE

01:24:31.633 --> 01:24:32.600
HELP YOU'RE COMMUNITIES ARE

01:24:32.667 --> 01:24:34.803
GONNA HAVE LONG TERM LET IS BAD

01:24:34.869 --> 01:24:36.271
AT ALL LEVELS.

01:24:36.337 --> 01:24:39.374
LET IS BAD FOR KIDS IT DOESN'T

01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:40.675

MAY GAS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND

01:24:43.845 --> 01:24:45.013
OTHER COMMITTEES.

01:24:45.079 --> 01:24:46.514
THIS IS PART OF THE PROBLEM IN

01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:48.283
THIS IS ONE OF MANY PROBLEMS I

01:24:48.349 --> 01:24:49.250
HAVE THIS IS THE REGENCY NOT

01:24:49.317 --> 01:24:50.485
JUST BECAUSE I GO HOME I LIVE IN

01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:52.220

HAPPENED TO ME AND MY NEIGHBORS.

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:54.823

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:56.291
OF OTHER LEGACY ISSUES THAT I

01:24:56.357 --> 01:24:57.959
NEED TO FIGHT FOR AND I'D LIKE

01:24:58.026 --> 01:24:59.694
TO HAVE THIS WILL BE A MODEL FOR

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:01.830
US MOVING FORWARD FOR ALL THE

01:25:01.896 --> 01:25:02.697
OTHER THINGS HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

01:25:02.764 --> 01:25:09.871
CHROMIUM SIX ARSENIC WAY MY

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:11.172

01:31:56.577 --> 01:31:57.979
YOU KNOW IN THOSE IN IN THOSE

01:31:58.045 --> 01:31:58.946
ENSUING YEARS WE HAVE

01:31:59.013 --> 01:32:00.548
IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF NEW

01:32:00.615 --> 01:32:01.415
FRAUD MEASURES THAT WE THINK

01:32:01.482 --> 01:32:02.016
HAVE.

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:04.018
REDUCED ILLEGAL REDEMPTION THAT

01:32:04.085 --> 01:32:05.286
MAY HAVE BEEN RECURRING WHICH IS

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:06.454
ALSO VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:10.157
STATE AND IRIS REFER TO SHARE

01:32:10.224 --> 01:32:11.559
RESPONSIBILITY OVER THAT FUND.

01:32:11.626 --> 01:32:12.093
AT THE SAME TIME THAT RATE

01:32:12.159 --> 01:32:13.261
REPRESENTS A RELATIONSHIP

01:32:13.327 --> 01:32:15.196
BETWEEN BEVERAGE SALES AND

01:32:15.263 --> 01:32:17.031
REDEMPTION AND WE HAVE SEEN A

01:32:17.098 --> 01:32:18.366
TAPE BRING IN SOME CASES OF THE

01:32:18.432 --> 01:32:20.401
BEVERAGE SALES SO REDEMPTION IS

01:32:20.468 --> 01:32:21.102
ACTUALLY BEEN.

01:32:21.168 --> 01:32:22.703
RELATIVELY ARE WE START WITHIN

01:32:22.770 --> 01:32:24.272
AN INCREASE IN BEVERAGE SALES

01:32:24.338 --> 01:32:25.806
REDEMPTION HAS BEEN RELATIVELY

01:32:25.873 --> 01:32:27.208
FLAT -- SO

01:32:27.275 --> 01:32:28.409
WE'RE NOT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE

01:32:28.476 --> 01:32:29.911
OUT WHY WE'RE NOT GETTING MORE

01:32:29.977 --> 01:32:32.747
REDEMPTION GIVEN THAT SALES ARE

01:32:32.813 --> 01:32:33.047
GOING UP --

01:32:33.114 --> 01:32:33.981
IT'S CERTAINLY.

01:32:34.048 --> 01:32:36.083
THAT IS DUE TO THE THE CLOSURES

01:32:36.150 --> 01:32:37.518
OF SOME THE SITE WE DON'T SEE A

01:32:37.585 --> 01:32:38.519
SIGNIFICANT DROP OFF BECAUSE OF

01:32:38.586 --> 01:32:40.521
THOSE BUT WE HAVE SEEN A DROP UP

01:32:40.588 --> 01:32:42.990
BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE CLOSURES --

01:32:43.057 --> 01:32:44.492
WITH RESPECT TO THE THE THE

01:32:44.558 --> 01:32:45.626
SURPLUS I JUST WANTED TO BE

01:32:45.693 --> 01:32:47.561
REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT OUR TERMS

01:32:47.628 --> 01:32:48.829
HERE --

01:32:48.896 --> 01:32:50.798
THANK YOU BECAUSE I'M YEAH I'M

01:32:50.865 --> 01:32:53.301
PRETTY SURE I YOU KNOW MISSTATED

01:32:53.367 --> 01:32:54.936
YEAH WE DO WITHOUT FUND AND AND

01:32:55.002 --> 01:32:56.637
I MAYBE I SHOULD JUST PREFACE

01:32:56.704 --> 01:32:57.371
THIS BY SAYING.

01:32:57.438 --> 01:32:58.806
BE VERY HAPPY TO COME IN A WALK

01:32:58.873 --> 01:32:59.774
THROUGH THE QUARTERLY REPORT IN

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:01.442
IN INTO A DEEPER DIVE INTO THE

01:33:01.509 --> 01:33:02.843
THE FUND CONDITION AND THE

01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:03.377
CONDITION OF ALL THE SUB

01:33:03.444 --> 01:33:04.712
ACCOUNTS AND THE RELEVANT

01:33:04.779 --> 01:33:06.547
FACTORS THAT LIMIT OR RESTRICT

01:33:06.614 --> 01:33:07.715
OUR ABILITY TO USE DIFFERENT SUB

01:33:07.782 --> 01:33:09.517
ACCOUNTS AND WHY THAT MIGHT BE.

01:33:09.583 --> 01:33:15.323
RELEVANT BUT THE THE REFLECTS

01:33:15.389 --> 01:33:16.991
THAT THE FUNNY CONDITIONER --

01:33:17.058 --> 01:33:18.960
FUND -- THE

01:33:19.026 --> 01:33:20.528
FUND -- YEAH

01:33:20.594 --> 01:33:22.797
FUND CONDITION OF TWO HUNDRED

01:33:22.863 --> 01:33:25.132
SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS --

01:33:25.199 --> 01:33:26.701
THE SIXTY FOUR MILLION.

01:33:26.767 --> 01:33:28.069
THAT YOU REFERENCED WAS A

01:33:28.135 --> 01:33:29.804
POTENTIAL PROJECTED SURPLUS BUT

01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:31.038
THOSE AGAIN ALL THESE NUMBERS

01:33:31.105 --> 01:33:32.340
ARE PROJECTIONS AND I CAN TELL

01:33:32.406 --> 01:33:33.841
YOU THAT --

01:33:33.908 --> 01:33:35.543
BASED ON THE MOST RECENT DATA

01:33:35.609 --> 01:33:36.110
THAT WE'RE SEEING SEEING WE

01:33:36.177 --> 01:33:37.611
DON'T.

01:33:37.678 --> 01:33:39.013
THINK THAT NECESSARILY BE COMING

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:40.214
TO FRUITION THINGS COULD BE

01:33:40.281 --> 01:33:41.115
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN

01:33:41.182 --> 01:33:42.583
THAT SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:33:42.650 --> 01:33:44.051
TO NOTE THAT THESE ARE ALL POINT

01:33:44.118 --> 01:33:45.653
IN TIME ESTIMATES --

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:47.521
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN

01:33:47.588 --> 01:33:48.789
MIND THAT EVEN IF THAT FUND

01:33:48.856 --> 01:33:50.925
CONDITION PROJECTED --

01:33:50.992 --> 01:33:52.059
IS ON THE ORDER OF THREE AND A

01:33:52.126 --> 01:33:53.327
MILLION DOLLARS AT ANY GIVEN

01:33:53.394 --> 01:33:54.795
POINT TIME.

01:33:54.862 --> 01:33:56.430
THE WAY THE PROGRAM WORKS WE

01:33:56.497 --> 01:33:58.366
COULD HAVE A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED

01:33:58.432 --> 01:33:58.899
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS NOT

01:33:58.966 --> 01:34:00.368
AVAILABLE TO US BECAUSE WE MIGHT

01:34:00.434 --> 01:34:01.836
BE PAYING OUT.

01:34:01.902 --> 01:34:03.771
IN ADVANCE --

01:34:03.838 --> 01:34:05.373
CRB BEFORE WE'RE GETTING IT BACK

01:34:05.439 --> 01:34:06.507
FROM THE DISTRIBUTOR SO JUST

01:34:06.574 --> 01:34:08.309
BECAUSE THE FUND BALANCES THERE

01:34:08.376 --> 01:34:09.744
DOES MEAN THERE'S A CASH

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:12.947
AVAILABLE FOR US TO EXPAND AND

01:34:13.014 --> 01:34:13.547
THEN FINALLY I WOULD JUST ADD

01:34:13.614 --> 01:34:16.150
THAT --

01:34:16.217 --> 01:34:18.085
THESE NUMBERS CAN CHANGE WILDLY --

01:34:18.152 --> 01:34:19.620
OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR TO

01:34:19.687 --> 01:34:21.989
EVERY SINGLE PERCENT INCREASE OR

01:34:22.056 --> 01:34:23.290
OR EVERY SINGLE PERCENT DECREASE

01:34:23.357 --> 01:34:24.925
BEVERAGE SALES IT'S ABOUT

01:34:24.992 --> 01:34:25.559
FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO THE

01:34:25.626 --> 01:34:26.627
FUND EVERY --

01:34:26.694 --> 01:34:28.496
PERCENT INCREASE REDEMPTION IS

01:34:28.562 --> 01:34:30.031
ALSO ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION

01:34:30.097 --> 01:34:31.165
DOLLARS AND SO.

01:34:31.232 --> 01:34:32.433
IF WE SEE JUST A COUPLE PERCENT

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:35.970
INCREASES ON THOSE SIX THREE

01:34:36.037 --> 01:34:36.604
SIXTY TO EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:37.638
ALL SAID THAT IT'S NOT

01:34:37.705 --> 01:34:39.073
MANIFESTING FOR SO THAT THERE

01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:40.341
ARE WILD SWINGS IN THESE NUMBERS

01:34:40.408 --> 01:34:41.308
A WHILE THEY LOOK LIKE VERY

01:34:41.375 --> 01:34:43.310
LARGE FUND BALANCES WE DO HAVE.

01:34:43.377 --> 01:34:44.745
TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT BUT TO

01:34:44.812 --> 01:34:46.113
COME TO YOUR YOUR YOUR ULTIMATE

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:47.748
QUESTION --

01:34:47.815 --> 01:34:49.483
I THINK WE WE ALL WOULD AGREE

01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:50.651
THAT --

01:34:50.718 --> 01:34:53.054
THERE'S A CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:53.888
WITH THE REDEMPTION CENTERS THE

01:34:53.954 --> 01:34:54.822
RECYCLING CENTERS MISSTATED

01:34:54.889 --> 01:34:56.223
CALIFORNIA AND THERE'S A NUMBER

01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:58.492
OF FACTORS THAT HAVE CAUSED THAT --

01:34:58.559 --> 01:35:00.327
ONE OF THEM ABSOLUTELY IS THAT --

01:35:00.394 --> 01:35:01.762
YOU KNOW THE PUT THE PROGRAM HAS

01:35:01.829 --> 01:35:02.963
NOT BEEN ABLE TO ALWAYS PROVIDE

01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:04.799
THAT THE A PAYMENT THAT REFLECTS

01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:06.267
THE ACTUAL COST OF THOSE

01:35:06.333 --> 01:35:08.135
RECYCLING CENTERS DUE TO THE

01:35:08.202 --> 01:35:09.470
TIMING OF HOW WE HAVE TO DO OUR

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:10.905
CALCULATIONS PER STATUTE.

01:35:10.971 --> 01:35:13.607
ANOTHER IS THAT ONE OF THE MAIN --

01:35:13.674 --> 01:35:14.542
FACTORS THAT ALLOW THESE

01:35:14.608 --> 01:35:16.077
RECYCLING CENTERS TO STAY A FLOW

01:35:16.143 --> 01:35:17.878
IMPROBABLE HAS BEEN THE FACT

01:35:17.945 --> 01:35:19.513
THAT ALUMINUM IS AT BEEN A VERY

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:21.282
VALUABLE COMMODITY FOR THESE

01:35:21.348 --> 01:35:23.017
RECYCLING CENTERS --

01:35:23.084 --> 01:35:24.285
AND AS WE SEE LESS QUICKLY

01:35:24.351 --> 01:35:25.719
UNLESS ALUMINUM IN THE MARKET

01:35:25.786 --> 01:35:27.021
PLACE COMPARED TO OTHER

01:35:27.088 --> 01:35:29.156
PACKAGING TYPES --

01:35:29.223 --> 01:35:30.458
THEIR PROFIT IS IT'S BEEN GOING

01:35:30.524 --> 01:35:31.792
DOWN AND WE'VE ALSO SEEN A

01:35:31.859 --> 01:35:33.594
RECENT VERY SIGNIFICANT DROP IN

01:35:33.661 --> 01:35:34.595
THE PRICE OF ALUMINUM WHICH IS

01:35:34.662 --> 01:35:35.763
PUTTING ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ALL

01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:37.198
THESE RECYCLING CENTERS.

01:35:37.264 --> 01:35:40.034
SO I THINK --

01:35:40.101 --> 01:35:41.569
IT'S IT'S A FAIR QUESTION THE

01:35:41.635 --> 01:35:44.305
TODAY SOMETHING THAT WOULD AGE

01:35:44.371 --> 01:35:46.240
DâN SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE

01:35:46.307 --> 01:35:49.710
COULD THE ONE WE WENT OVER THE

01:35:49.777 --> 01:35:51.545
FINE CONDITION --

01:35:51.612 --> 01:35:53.180
THANK YOU FOR THE RATHER

01:35:53.247 --> 01:35:54.548
DETAILED.

01:35:54.615 --> 01:35:56.450
RESPONSE AND FOR YOU KNOW

01:35:56.517 --> 01:35:57.685
SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON

01:35:57.751 --> 01:36:00.054
ALL AND THE LIMITATIONS ON THE

01:36:00.121 --> 01:36:03.157
FUND AND AND THE CALLS ON THE

01:36:03.224 --> 01:36:04.391
PHONE -- I

01:36:04.458 --> 01:36:06.460
THINK THE UNDERLYING ISSUE HERE

01:36:06.527 --> 01:36:09.530
AT THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:10.998
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW.

01:36:11.065 --> 01:36:14.869
IS HOW DO WE TURN THIS AROUND --

01:36:14.935 --> 01:36:18.405
AND MAKE CALIFORNIA --

01:36:18.472 --> 01:36:21.041
IN THE NATION OF AS AS IT SHOULD

01:36:21.108 --> 01:36:22.343
BE WE'VE BEEN.

01:36:22.409 --> 01:36:24.879
DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME FOR

01:36:24.945 --> 01:36:27.314
FOR MANY MANY DECADES NOW --

01:36:27.381 --> 01:36:28.582
WERE WELL PRACTICED AT IT WE

01:36:28.649 --> 01:36:30.017
SHOULD UNDERSTAND --

01:36:30.084 --> 01:36:31.886
WHERE THE IMPROVEMENTS NEED TO

01:36:31.952 --> 01:36:37.024
BE AND AND THE OF I LOOK FORWARD --

01:36:37.091 --> 01:36:38.826
UNDER THE NEW ADMINISTRATION TO

01:36:38.893 --> 01:36:40.794
TAKING A FRESH LOOK AT THIS

01:36:40.861 --> 01:36:43.697
ISSUE AND FIXING IT --

01:36:43.764 --> 01:36:45.132
WE WE NEED TO BE FLEET OF FOOT

01:36:45.199 --> 01:36:46.700
WHEN -- WE

01:36:46.767 --> 01:36:48.469
LIVE IN A IN A TIME WHEN THINGS

01:36:48.536 --> 01:36:49.570
DO CHANGE.

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:51.605
OF VERY QUICKLY WE DIDN'T KNOW A

01:36:51.672 --> 01:36:53.374
COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT CHINA WAS

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.542
GOING -- TO

01:36:54.608 --> 01:36:56.677
YOU KNOW CHANGE --

01:36:56.744 --> 01:36:58.345
ITS RULES ON WHAT IT WAS WILLING

01:36:58.412 --> 01:37:00.381
TO ACCEPT A MINISTER MEDICALLY

01:37:00.447 --> 01:37:03.918
CHANGE THE THE PLAYING FIELD

01:37:03.984 --> 01:37:08.189
HERE IN OUR ABILITY --

01:37:08.255 --> 01:37:11.525
TO ADAPT AND ADJUST AND A KEEPER

01:37:11.592 --> 01:37:14.195
SYSTEM GOING SEEMS TO BE --

01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:16.664
VERY CALCIFIED AND I THINK THERE

01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:20.134
ARE SOME REASONS FOR THAT BUT

01:37:20.201 --> 01:37:21.602
YOU KNOW I'M GONNA --

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:23.571
TRYING CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE

01:37:23.637 --> 01:37:25.206
THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY ISSUE

AND LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU

01:37:27.908 --> 01:37:29.677

WITH RESPECT TO THIS DAY WHAT

MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT FOR WASTE

01:37:46.694 --> 01:37:48.329

TARGETED --

01:38:14.755 --> 01:38:16.290
SECTOR OF GENERATOR SO WASTE AT

01:38:16.357 --> 01:38:17.825
THE POINT OF GENERATION BECAUSE

01:38:17.891 --> 01:38:18.959
THE WASTE CAN CHANGE FROM THE

01:38:19.026 --> 01:38:20.327
POINT OF GENERATION TO THE POINT

HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO IMPLEMENT

01:41:12.466 --> 01:41:14.368
THEIR MISSION BUT IT'S ALSO BAD

01:41:14.435 --> 01:41:15.969
WHEN CONSUMER MONEY IS LEFT ON

01:41:16.036 --> 01:41:18.272

WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN A NUMBER

01:43:26.867 --> 01:43:28.368
OF POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES

01:43:28.435 --> 01:43:29.703
DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS

THIRTEEN ONE THAT'S OF GREAT

01:52:26.239 --> 01:52:27.874
INTEREST TO ME AS A KERRY

01:52:27.941 --> 01:52:29.642
LEGISLATION ON THIS --

01:52:29.709 --> 01:52:31.111
GENERAL TOPIC AND TO SENATOR

01:52:31.177 --> 01:52:33.279
PORTANTINO I THINK WHOSE --

01:52:33.346 --> 01:52:35.115
WAS THE AUTHOR OF SB FORTY FOUR

01:52:35.181 --> 01:52:36.049
YES I THINK A GRAPHIC AND

01:52:36.116 --> 01:52:38.251
DEFINITELY A HOT SO THIS IS A A

01:52:38.318 --> 01:52:42.622
AND ESTABLISHING A TESTING

01:52:42.689 --> 01:52:44.624
METHOD FOR MICRO PLASTIC SO.

01:52:44.691 --> 01:52:46.659
KIND OF THE FIRST STEP REQUIRED

01:52:46.726 --> 01:52:48.561
OF ANYTHING THAT WE'RE PROPOSING

01:52:48.628 --> 01:52:49.929
TO COULD CONTEMPLATE BOTH WHAT

01:52:49.996 --> 01:52:51.631
IT'S HEALTH IMPACTS WILL BE ANY

01:52:51.698 --> 01:52:53.433
FUTURE REGULATIONS IN ACCORDANCE

01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:54.167
WITH THAT.

01:52:54.234 --> 01:52:55.835
IS NECESSARY ESTABLISHING A

01:52:55.902 --> 01:52:57.537
UNIFORM OUT THAT THAT ANYBODY

01:52:57.604 --> 01:52:59.239
CAN GO OUT AND PERFORM AND WE

01:52:59.305 --> 01:53:00.907
GET A VALID ANSWER BACK FROM

01:53:00.974 --> 01:53:02.308
WHOEVER IS PERFORMING ITSELF.

01:53:02.375 --> 01:53:03.209
ALL RIGHT NOW IN MICHAEL

01:53:03.276 --> 01:53:04.444
PLASTICS THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:53:04.511 --> 01:53:05.712
RESEARCH GOING ON THERE'S A LOT

01:53:05.778 --> 01:53:07.147
OF ACADEMIC METHODS THAT ARE OUT

01:53:07.213 --> 01:53:08.181
THERE BUT THEY ALL PERFORM A

01:53:08.248 --> 01:53:09.282
LITTLE DIFFERENT VALUE AND GIVE

01:53:09.349 --> 01:53:10.683
YOU DIFFERENT RESULTS.

01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:12.685
SO THIS IS A REQUEST HERE IS FOR

01:53:12.752 --> 01:53:14.087
US TO BE ABLE --

01:53:14.154 --> 01:53:15.421
TO BASICALLY DEVELOP A METHOD

01:53:15.488 --> 01:53:16.856
UNIVERSALLY --

01:53:16.923 --> 01:53:19.225
THAT WE CAN THEN DEPLOY AND AND

01:53:19.292 --> 01:53:20.693
START DOWN THE PROGRESS OF

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.228
UNDERSTANDING MICHAEL PLASTICS

01:53:22.295 --> 01:53:23.429
AND AS YOU CAN APPRECIATE THESE

01:53:23.496 --> 01:53:24.731
ARE SUPER COMPLEX BECAUSE THERE

01:53:24.797 --> 01:53:26.432
ARE SO MANY THINGS WHEN YOU SAY

01:53:26.499 --> 01:53:27.167
MICHAEL PLASTICS THAT CAN

01:53:27.233 --> 01:53:28.001
INCLUDE.

01:53:28.067 --> 01:53:29.836
PAINT CHIPS MICROFIBER FROM

01:53:29.903 --> 01:53:31.671
CLOTHING --

01:53:31.738 --> 01:53:33.072
DISSOLVE PLASTIC MATERIALS GOES

01:53:33.139 --> 01:53:34.741
ON AND ON AND SO THIS IS GOING

01:53:34.807 --> 01:53:36.543
TO BE A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE IT'S

01:53:36.609 --> 01:53:37.110
A VERY BROAD THING TO SAY

01:53:37.177 --> 01:53:38.311
MICHAEL PLASTIC IT SEEMS LIKE

01:53:38.378 --> 01:53:39.145
ONE THING BUT I HAVE A FEELING

01:53:39.212 --> 01:53:40.747
THAT IT'S MULTIPLE THINGS WE'RE

01:53:40.813 --> 01:53:42.615
GONNA BE ABLE TO CATALOG DOESN'T

01:53:42.682 --> 01:53:43.049
WORK TOWARDS THEM.

01:53:43.116 --> 01:53:46.452
IT IS VERY COMPLICATED AND IT'S

01:53:46.519 --> 01:53:48.521
AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE CREATED FOR

01:53:48.588 --> 01:53:49.856
UNWITTINGLY FOR OUR FOR

01:53:49.923 --> 01:53:52.258
OURSELVES AND I THINK THE

01:53:52.325 --> 01:53:56.663
SOLUTIONS ARE GOING TO BE --

01:53:56.729 --> 01:54:00.533
A DIFFICULT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW

01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:04.204
EXISTS YET EXACTLY DEFINITELY.

01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:06.139
IF THERE'S NO --

01:54:06.206 --> 01:54:09.542
QUESTIONS WILL MOVE ON A

01:54:09.609 --> 01:54:11.711
FOURTEEN ISSUE NUMBER --

01:54:11.778 --> 01:54:13.947

THIS IS BASICALLY RECYCLING WITH

01:54:28.194 --> 01:54:29.896
IN BUILDINGS NOT GENERALLY

01:54:29.963 --> 01:54:32.298
RECYCLING AS MUNICIPAL WASTE

01:54:32.365 --> 01:54:33.299

BUILDING BEFORE THEY LET GO OF

01:54:45.712 --> 01:54:47.013
IT MAKES SENSE --

01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:48.881

DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WITH

INADEQUATE SEPTIC TANKS SYSTEMS --

01:56:01.087 --> 01:56:01.954
THIS IS FOR THE PURPOSES OF

TO SOURCES OF OF DRINKING WATER

01:56:06.392 --> 01:56:08.461
SO WE NEED TO LOOK BOTH THAT THE

01:56:08.528 --> 01:56:09.128

01:56:09.195 --> 01:56:11.030

SEPTIC TANKS OFTEN SERVE RURAL

LEADING PROPERTY OWNERS WITH NO --

01:56:25.778 --> 01:56:28.181
NO OBVIOUS REALISTIC ALTERNATIVE --

EVEN WHEN I'M PROPERTY OWNERS

01:56:29.749 --> 01:56:31.384

ESTABLISHED COMMUNITY

01:56:32.919 --> 01:56:34.554
COMMUNITIES WITH SEWER SYSTEMS.

01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:35.621
THE COST OF REMOVING THEIR

SEPTIC TANKS CAN RUN INTO TENS

01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:38.991
OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.

01:56:39.058 --> 01:56:41.327
THE CHALLENGES ARE MAGNIFIED BY

01:56:41.394 --> 01:56:43.830
THE FACT THAT FREQUENTLY --

BY SEPTIC TANKS.

01:56:59.278 --> 01:57:00.513
SO THESE RESOURCES WILL ALLOW

PUZZLE FOR ENSURING THAT.

02:16:09.227 --> 02:16:12.063
IS THAT THE THE LACK OF

02:16:12.130 --> 02:16:14.566

THE MAP ABOUT APPLIANCES SYSTEM

02:17:09.888 --> 02:17:11.089
CHALLENGES.

02:17:11.156 --> 02:17:12.290
THE SOLUTIONS FOR COMMUNITIES

WITH ARSENIC CONTAMINATED WELLS

02:17:13.491 --> 02:17:14.893
IN EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY WILL

02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:15.860
BE DIFFERENT THAN THOSE IT'S

02:17:15.927 --> 02:17:17.162
THAN STEPS TAKEN TO ADDRESS

02:17:57.302 --> 02:17:58.603
IT IS JUST AS REAL RISK

02:17:58.670 --> 02:17:59.904
REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE FOR

02:17:59.971 --> 02:18:01.039
PEOPLE IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

02:18:01.106 --> 02:18:02.240
LUCKY ENOUGH TO ALREADY HAVE

ACCESS TO CLEAN AND SAFE

02:18:03.008 --> 02:18:04.342

THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT DO NOT

02:18:07.779 --> 02:18:08.446
YET HAVE ACCESS.

02:18:08.513 --> 02:18:09.914
IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS THE

02:18:23.028 --> 02:18:24.329
THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING

02:18:24.396 --> 02:18:26.064
STATUTORY LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH

02:18:26.131 --> 02:18:27.766
A PROGRAM THE PRICE GRANTS LOANS

DRINKING WATER SOURCES.

02:18:56.561 --> 02:18:57.729
WE HAVE TO ADD ANSWER ANY

02:18:57.796 --> 02:18:58.296
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS YOU MAY

02:18:58.363 --> 02:19:01.466
HAVE.

02:19:01.533 --> 02:19:02.834
LA L. SEAN MARTIN WITH THE

02:19:02.901 --> 02:19:05.737
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND

02:19:05.804 --> 02:19:07.372
KAREN ALICE'S AT THIS AT THIS

02:19:07.439 --> 02:19:09.541
PROPOSAL WE HAVE SOME COMMENTS

02:19:09.607 --> 02:19:11.710
AND SOME ISSUES FOR THE

02:19:11.776 --> 02:19:12.811
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER.

02:19:12.877 --> 02:19:14.179
A FIRST SO IT'S UNCERTAIN THE

02:19:14.245 --> 02:19:15.714
EXTENT TO WHICH THE PROPOSED

02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:18.149
REVENUES WILL FULLY ADDRESS THE

02:19:18.216 --> 02:19:18.850
PROBLEMS.

02:19:18.917 --> 02:19:20.151
THAT ADMINISTRATION IS NOT

02:19:20.218 --> 02:19:21.986
COMPLETED AN ESTIMATE OF THE

02:19:22.053 --> 02:19:23.621
TOTAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

02:19:23.688 --> 02:19:25.256
BRINGING WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE

02:19:25.323 --> 02:19:26.725
CURRENTLY UNABLE TO ME WATER

02:19:26.791 --> 02:19:28.093
QUALITY STANDARDS INTO

02:19:28.159 --> 02:19:29.761
COMPLIANCE --

02:19:29.828 --> 02:19:31.329
ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

02:19:31.396 --> 02:19:33.732
THEY WERE FUNDED LAST FALL TO

02:19:33.798 --> 02:19:35.633
UNDERTAKE A STUDY --

02:19:35.700 --> 02:19:37.302
AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT WILL

02:19:37.368 --> 02:19:39.904
BE COMPLETED IN THE FALL OF TWO

02:19:39.971 --> 02:19:40.405
THOUSAND TWENTY AND IN

02:19:40.472 --> 02:19:41.139
DISCUSSIONS WITH AND THEY

02:19:41.206 --> 02:19:42.607
INDICATED THAT SOME PARTS OF THE

02:19:42.674 --> 02:19:45.243
STUDY MAY BE AVAILABLE SOONER.

02:19:45.310 --> 02:19:46.411
WE KNOW THAT A PRIVATE

02:19:46.478 --> 02:19:48.379
CONSULTING FIRM DID AN ESTIMATE

02:19:48.446 --> 02:19:50.749
AND THEY ESTIMATED IT WOULD COST

02:19:50.815 --> 02:19:51.850
A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION.

02:19:51.916 --> 02:19:53.585
HOWEVER THAT ESTIMATE IS HIGHLY

02:19:53.651 --> 02:19:55.553
UNCERTAIN AND SO IT'S POSSIBLE

02:19:55.620 --> 02:19:56.621
THE ACTUAL COSTS COULD BE

02:19:56.688 --> 02:19:59.124
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER OR LOWER

02:19:59.190 --> 02:20:00.391
THAN THE ESTIMATES THAT ARE

02:20:00.458 --> 02:20:01.926
AVAILABLE TODAY.

02:20:01.993 --> 02:20:03.194
WE ALSO NOTE THAT MOST CHARGE

02:20:03.261 --> 02:20:05.697
PAIRS WOULD NOT BE DIRECT

02:20:05.764 --> 02:20:07.465
BENEFICIARIES OF THE OF THE

02:20:07.532 --> 02:20:08.767
PROGRAM --

02:20:08.833 --> 02:20:10.435
THE MAIN BENEFICIARIES OF THE

02:20:10.502 --> 02:20:11.603
PROGRAM WOULD BE PEOPLE AND

02:20:11.669 --> 02:20:13.404
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND

02:20:13.471 --> 02:20:19.110
SIR BY SMALLER WATER SYSTEMS

02:20:19.177 --> 02:20:20.378
WOULD BE BORNE BY TWO GREAT

02:20:20.445 --> 02:20:22.213
PAIRS ACROSS THE STATE WITH AND

02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:23.348
THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS FOR LOW

02:20:23.414 --> 02:20:26.518
INCOME PERSONS AND CUSTOMERS --

02:20:26.584 --> 02:20:28.052
ASSISTANCE WITH LESS THAN TWO

02:20:28.119 --> 02:20:31.122
HUNDRED CONNECTIONS SO.

02:20:31.189 --> 02:20:32.757
GENERALLY SPEAKING THEIR WEIGHT

02:20:32.824 --> 02:20:34.192
COULD BE SOME BENEFIT TO FOLKS

02:20:34.259 --> 02:20:36.094
SERVICE IN AN AREA WHERE THE

02:20:36.161 --> 02:20:38.363
THIS PROGRAM HAS BROUGHT THE

02:20:38.429 --> 02:20:40.698
WATER SYSTEM INTO COMPLIANCE BUT

02:20:40.765 --> 02:20:42.033
MOST OF THE RATE PAYERS IN THE

02:20:42.100 --> 02:20:43.201
STATE.

02:20:43.268 --> 02:20:44.536
WOULDN'T BE BENEFITING IT TOOK

02:20:44.602 --> 02:20:46.271
FROM IT THIS PROGRAM DIRECTLY IN

02:20:46.337 --> 02:20:49.174
TERMS OF IN MAKING IMPROVEMENTS

02:20:49.240 --> 02:20:51.109
TO THEIR WATER SYSTEM.

02:20:51.176 --> 02:20:52.377
WE ALSO NOTE THAT SOME OF THE

02:20:52.443 --> 02:20:53.478
CHARGE PAIRS.

02:20:53.545 --> 02:20:54.846
WOULD NOT BE AT FAULT FOR THE

02:20:54.913 --> 02:20:56.414
CONTAMINATION BE MEDICAID AND

02:20:56.481 --> 02:20:58.349
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THE

02:20:58.416 --> 02:20:59.350
VAST MAJORITY OF NITRATE

02:20:59.417 --> 02:21:01.219
CONTAMINATION IS CAUSED BY

02:21:01.286 --> 02:21:02.821
AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY SUCH AS

02:21:02.887 --> 02:21:04.889
FERTILIZER APPLICATIONS AND ANIL

02:21:04.956 --> 02:21:07.725
MODERATION SEARCHES AS DAIRIES.

02:21:07.792 --> 02:21:09.360
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO

02:21:09.427 --> 02:21:11.462
HAVE THESE AGRICULTURAL ENTITIES

02:21:11.529 --> 02:21:13.364
PLAY CHARGES CREATES A NICE LINK

02:21:13.431 --> 02:21:15.400
BETWEEN THE OPERATIONS THAT ARE

02:21:15.466 --> 02:21:16.267
THE MAIN SOURCE OF THE NITRATE

02:21:16.334 --> 02:21:17.535
CONTAMINATION.

02:21:17.602 --> 02:21:19.304
AND THE ENTITIES THAT WOULD PAY

02:21:19.370 --> 02:21:20.371
THE CHARGES TO MEDICATE IT

02:21:20.438 --> 02:21:21.539
HOWEVER IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING

02:21:21.606 --> 02:21:22.540
THAT SOME OF THAT NITRATE

02:21:22.607 --> 02:21:24.609
CONTAMINATION WOULD NOT BE A

02:21:24.676 --> 02:21:25.810
DIRECT RESULT OF THEIR

02:21:25.877 --> 02:21:28.046
OPERATIONS IT COULD HAVE BEEN.

02:21:28.112 --> 02:21:29.380
THAT SOME OF THE CONTAMINATION A

02:21:29.447 --> 02:21:31.683
WAS FROM A LEGACY CONTAMINATION

02:21:31.749 --> 02:21:33.751
FROM DECADES AGO --

02:21:33.818 --> 02:21:35.653
WE LOOKED AT ALTERNATIVE SOURCES

02:21:35.720 --> 02:21:36.354
OF FUNDING THAT COULD

02:21:36.421 --> 02:21:38.823
POTENTIALLY BE AVAILABLE TO PAY

02:21:38.890 --> 02:21:39.924
FOR THE PROGRAM.

02:21:39.991 --> 02:21:42.627
I GENERALLY WE DIDN'T FIND WE

02:21:42.694 --> 02:21:44.095
FOUND THAT THERE LIMITED --

02:21:44.162 --> 02:21:46.497
GENERAL FUND IS AN ALTERNATIVE

02:21:46.564 --> 02:21:48.099
FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE PROGRAM

02:21:48.166 --> 02:21:49.834
HOWEVER THE PROGRAM WOULD HAVE

02:21:49.901 --> 02:21:51.736
TO COMPETE WITH OTHER PROGRAMS

02:21:51.803 --> 02:21:57.175
THAT RELY ON THE GENERAL FUND.

02:21:57.242 --> 02:21:57.976
OF FOR SUPPORT [inaudible]

02:21:58.042 --> 02:22:00.178
AND WE DON'T THINK THAT BOND

02:22:00.245 --> 02:22:00.778
FUNDING IS APPROPRIATE FOR FOR

02:22:00.845 --> 02:22:01.913
THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THE ONE

02:22:01.980 --> 02:22:03.147
TIME NATURE OF THAT --

02:22:03.214 --> 02:22:05.383
BOND FUND IT AND THIS PROGRAM

02:22:05.450 --> 02:22:06.951
REQUIRES AN ONGOING FUNDING

02:22:07.018 --> 02:22:07.952
SOURCE.

02:22:08.019 --> 02:22:09.220
AND WE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED ANY

02:22:09.287 --> 02:22:10.822
EXISTING SPECIAL FUNDS THAT

02:22:10.889 --> 02:22:12.357
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO SUPPORT

02:22:12.423 --> 02:22:14.659
THIS PROGRAM IT WOULD HAVE

02:22:14.726 --> 02:22:17.462
SUFFICIENT AVAILABLE FUNDS --

02:22:17.528 --> 02:22:18.096
FINALLY WE ALSO NOTE THAT THERE

02:22:18.162 --> 02:22:21.299
AS BECAUSE OF SAFE HARBOR

02:22:21.366 --> 02:22:22.467
PROVISIONS ABOUT SOME TRADE OFFS

02:22:22.533 --> 02:22:24.202
COMPARED TO THE STATE'S CURRENT

02:22:24.269 --> 02:22:25.570
ENFORCEMENT APPROACH.

02:22:25.637 --> 02:22:27.105
ON THE ONE HAND THE PROPOSAL IS

02:22:27.171 --> 02:22:28.940
STRUCTURED TO BETTER ENSURE THAT

02:22:29.007 --> 02:22:30.541
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

02:22:30.608 --> 02:22:32.977
FUNDING AVAILABLE. FOR WATER

02:22:33.044 --> 02:22:34.646
QUALITY MITIGATION THROUGHOUT

02:22:34.712 --> 02:22:37.348
THE STATE RATHER THAN LIMITED

02:22:37.415 --> 02:22:39.050
AIR AREAS AND IN CERTAIN AREAS

02:22:39.117 --> 02:22:40.952

02:22:47.859 --> 02:22:50.428
GEOGRAPHIC AREA --

02:22:50.495 --> 02:22:51.529
FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE REALLY

02:22:51.596 --> 02:22:53.431
USES CLEAN UP IN A DATE IN ORDER

02:22:53.498 --> 02:22:55.066
FOR NITRATE CONTAMINATION ON THE

02:22:55.133 --> 02:22:57.101
OTHER HAND THE THE PROPOSAL.

02:22:57.168 --> 02:22:58.303
THE STATE WOULD RELINQUISH

02:22:58.369 --> 02:22:59.637
AUTHORITY TO TAKE CERTAIN

02:22:59.704 --> 02:23:00.872

COMMENT I KNOW THERE'S SOME

02:23:27.765 --> 02:23:30.668
FOLKS WHO WANT TO SPEAK ON THIS

BACK UP WITH THAT PLEASE.

02:23:42.380 --> 02:23:44.349
THIS IS A SERIES OF PROPOSALS --

02:23:44.415 --> 02:23:44.649
THAT HAS --

02:23:44.716 --> 02:23:45.183
CREATED A SITUATION WHERE

02:23:45.249 --> 02:23:47.218
EVERYBODY HAS SOMETHING TO BE

02:23:47.285 --> 02:23:51.189
UNHAPPY ABOUT.

02:23:51.255 --> 02:23:52.123
THANK YOU CHAIR BLOOM AND

02:23:52.190 --> 02:23:52.690
MEMBERS CINDY TECH WITH THE

02:23:52.757 --> 02:23:53.324
ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER

02:23:53.391 --> 02:23:55.526
AGENCIES WE HAVE AN OPPOSE

02:23:55.593 --> 02:23:57.628
UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE

02:23:57.695 --> 02:23:59.097
BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE.

02:23:59.163 --> 02:24:00.765
AND THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE WATER

02:24:00.832 --> 02:24:03.468
TAX PART OF THE LANGUAGE.

02:24:03.534 --> 02:24:05.837
WE AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT

02:24:05.903 --> 02:24:07.505
THERE IS A PROBLEM WE AGREE THAT

02:24:07.572 --> 02:24:09.140
THERE NEEDS TO BE ACTION THIS

02:24:09.207 --> 02:24:11.376
YEAR ON THE FUNDING SOLUTION.

02:24:11.442 --> 02:24:14.979
BUT THIS CAN BE SOLVED WITHOUT A

02:24:15.046 --> 02:24:16.047
WATER TAX.

02:24:16.114 --> 02:24:18.149
THE WATER TAX PART OF THE BUDGET

02:24:18.216 --> 02:24:20.184
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS VERY

02:24:20.251 --> 02:24:22.487
SIMILAR TO THE A LANGUAGE THAT

02:24:22.553 --> 02:24:23.855
THE ADMINISTRATION LAST YEAR

02:24:23.921 --> 02:24:26.224
WITH GOVERNOR BROWN ADVANCED.

02:24:26.290 --> 02:24:27.925
YOU'LL RECALL THAT THE FOR THOSE

02:24:27.992 --> 02:24:29.260
OF YOU WHO WERE HERE LAST YEAR

02:24:29.327 --> 02:24:30.795
YOU'LL RECALL THAT THE JOINT

02:24:30.862 --> 02:24:32.263
BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE.

02:24:32.330 --> 02:24:35.833
REJECTED THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL

02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:38.002
WATER TAX LANGUAGE IN IT.

02:24:38.069 --> 02:24:39.937
ON THE MERITS THREE QUICK POINTS

02:24:40.004 --> 02:24:41.739
WE DON'T THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO

02:24:41.806 --> 02:24:43.674
TAX A RESOURCE THAT'S ESSENTIAL

02:24:43.741 --> 02:24:45.910
TO LIVING THE STATE DOESN'T TAX

02:24:45.977 --> 02:24:47.378
YOUR TAP WATER AT HOME IT

02:24:47.445 --> 02:24:48.312
DOESN'T TAX.

02:24:48.379 --> 02:24:49.781
YOUR FOOD WHEN YOU GO TO THE

02:24:49.847 --> 02:24:51.883
GROCERY STORE.

02:24:51.949 --> 02:24:53.951
ANOTHER POINT IS THE HUMAN RIGHT

02:24:54.018 --> 02:24:55.620
TO WATER PROVIDES A RIGHT TO

02:24:55.686 --> 02:24:58.156
BOTH SAFE AND AFFORDABLE

02:24:58.222 --> 02:24:59.924
DRINKING WATER --

02:24:59.991 --> 02:25:02.360
THE TAX IN THE IMPLEMENTATION

02:25:02.427 --> 02:25:04.395
COSTS FOR IT WOULD ADD TO THE

02:25:04.462 --> 02:25:07.198
COST WATER THE WAY IT'S PROPOSED

02:25:07.265 --> 02:25:09.434
IT WOULD HAVE ABOUT THREE

02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:10.735
THOUSAND LOCAL SYSTEMS ACROSS

02:25:10.802 --> 02:25:11.869
THE STATE IMPLEMENT IT.

02:25:11.936 --> 02:25:13.538
SO YOU WOULD HAVE EACH OF THOSE

02:25:13.604 --> 02:25:15.473
SYSTEMS PAYING TO CHANGE THE

02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:17.075
SOFTWARE THAT CAN BE FOR SOME

02:25:17.141 --> 02:25:19.710
SYSTEMS A HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR

02:25:19.777 --> 02:25:20.711
SOME MORE SOME LESS.

02:25:20.778 --> 02:25:23.047
ALSO HIRING A STAFF PERSON IN

02:25:23.114 --> 02:25:24.449
SOME CASES MORE THAN ONE STAFF

02:25:24.515 --> 02:25:27.285
PERSON TO IMPLEMENT THE TAX WHEN

02:25:27.351 --> 02:25:30.388
YOU MULTIPLY THE COST TIMES

02:25:30.455 --> 02:25:31.656
THREE THOUSAND AGENCIES THE

02:25:31.722 --> 02:25:34.025
IMPLEMENTATION COSTS SKYROCKET.

02:25:34.092 --> 02:25:36.060
AND THAT MAKES WATER YOU KNOW IT

02:25:36.127 --> 02:25:39.197
ADDS TO THE COST OF WATER MAKING

02:25:39.263 --> 02:25:40.465
IT ON AFFORDABLE.

02:25:40.531 --> 02:25:41.332
SO FINALLY THE LAST POINT IS

02:25:41.399 --> 02:25:42.700
THIS WOULD BE THE PRESIDENT FOR

02:25:42.767 --> 02:25:44.635
A STATE TAX ON WATER IN

02:25:44.702 --> 02:25:46.404
CALIFORNIA.

02:25:46.471 --> 02:25:48.005
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THERE'S A

02:25:48.072 --> 02:25:50.341
BETTER APPROACH SENATOR CAFIERO

02:25:50.408 --> 02:25:52.677
HAS SB SIX SIX NINE WHICH WOULD

02:25:52.743 --> 02:25:54.312
CREATE THE SAFE DRINKING WATER

02:25:54.378 --> 02:25:55.446
TRUST.

02:25:55.513 --> 02:25:57.748
AND THAT COULD REPLACE THE

02:25:57.815 --> 02:26:00.184
PROPOSED WATER TAX AWKWARD IN

02:26:00.251 --> 02:26:01.786
CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES

02:26:01.853 --> 02:26:03.221
ASSOCIATION ARE SPONSORING THAT

02:26:03.287 --> 02:26:05.456

02:26:05.523 --> 02:26:07.191
TRUST FROM DANIEL GLASS IT.

02:26:07.258 --> 02:26:09.260
BUT IN CLOSING AWKWARD WOULD

02:26:09.327 --> 02:26:11.462
REQUEST THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE

02:26:11.529 --> 02:26:13.664
REJECT THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL

02:26:13.731 --> 02:26:15.900
BECAUSE OF THE WATER TAX PART.

02:26:15.967 --> 02:26:18.102
THE OTHER PARTS WERE OKAY WITH

02:26:18.169 --> 02:26:19.570

YOU KEEP TO WANDER LAST THAT

02:26:37.255 --> 02:26:37.622
WOULD BE.

02:26:37.688 --> 02:26:39.257
GREAT OKAY HERE SOMEBODY ELSE --

02:26:39.323 --> 02:26:40.258

AND YOU KNOW WE'RE IN OPPOSE

02:26:47.999 --> 02:26:49.433
UNLESS AENDED POSITION AS WELL

02:26:49.500 --> 02:26:50.701
BECAUSE OF THE PROPOSED WATER

02:26:50.768 --> 02:26:53.871
TAX THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE SB

02:26:53.938 --> 02:26:54.739
SIX SIX NINE CREATES A SAFE

02:26:54.805 --> 02:26:56.207
DRINKING WATER TRUST USING

02:26:56.274 --> 02:26:58.142
GENERAL FUND DOLLARS DURING A

02:26:58.209 --> 02:26:59.577
BUDGET SURPLUS YEAR --

02:26:59.644 --> 02:27:01.345
WE UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS ABOUT

02:27:01.412 --> 02:27:03.080
UTILIZING GENERAL FUND FOR

02:27:03.147 --> 02:27:05.583
SOLUTION AS AN ONGOING SOLUTION

02:27:05.650 --> 02:27:07.618
BACK TO THE SAFE DRINKING WATER

02:27:07.685 --> 02:27:09.253
TRUST WOULD HAVE A GENERAL AND

02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:11.255
AT ONE TIME OR MAYBE OVER TWO

02:27:11.322 --> 02:27:12.757
YEARS AND FUSION OF GENERAL FUND

02:27:12.823 --> 02:27:14.058
DOLLARS SO IT WOULD NOT BE

02:27:14.125 --> 02:27:15.059
ONGOING.

02:27:15.126 --> 02:27:16.761
IT WOULD JUST BE THAT INITIAL

02:27:16.827 --> 02:27:19.063
INFUSION UNLIKE THE WATER TAX

02:27:19.130 --> 02:27:20.064
PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET TRAILER

02:27:20.131 --> 02:27:22.366

02:35:27.885 --> 02:35:29.353
GOING TO TRIGGER A RACE TO THE

02:35:29.420 --> 02:35:30.454
BOTTOM.

02:35:30.521 --> 02:35:34.091
PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT EXT TERMS

02:35:45.169 --> 02:35:46.003

02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:48.005
COMMUNITIES TO APPLY IF THEY

02:35:48.072 --> 02:35:49.573
MEET A CERTAIN THRESHOLD OF

02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:50.841

02:35:50.908 --> 02:35:52.309
