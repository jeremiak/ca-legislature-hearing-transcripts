AND IF YOU COULD MAYBE HUMOR ME WITH THIRTY MORE SECONDS- INFORMED CONSENT FROM MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS IS A MUST. WHEN PUBLIC OFFICIALS BEGIN MAKING MEDICAL RECOMMENDATIONS IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY GIVE FULL INFORMATION ON BENEFITS AND RISKS AS WELL. IT HAS BEEN WIDELY OBSERVED THAT IN DEVELOPED OR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES REGULAR USE OF PAP SMEARS. AND BETTER OVERALL ATTENTION TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH HAVE ALREADY BROUGHT DOWN RATES OF CERVICAL CANCER. A COUPLE OF THINGS ON THE GARDASIL SHOT ITSELF WE KNOW THAT FOR GARDASIL. THERE ISN'T EVEN COMPLETE CREEK CLINICAL TRIAL DATA WITH APPROPRIATE AND POINTS. TO INDICATE WHETHER OR NOT ANY POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN VACCINE STRAINS OF HPV. IT QUITE SO TRUE CANCER REDUCTION. MERCK WAS ALLOWED BY REGULATORS TO CUT THE TRIAL SHORT AFTER FAST TRACK APPROVAL WAS GRANTED. WE KNOW THAT DURING THE CLINICAL TRIAL DATA WERE AGGREGATED FOR THE GROUP'S GIVEN THE PLACEBO AND THE ALUMINUM ADJUVANT WHEN REPORTED. SO THAT IT LOOKED LIKE ADVERSE EVENTS FOR THE VACCINE ARM OF THE STUDY WERE SIMILAR. THE ADVERSE EVENTS FOR THE BUNCH PLACEBO AND ADJUVANT GROUPS. THIS WAS BEEN REPORTED AS SAFE AS PLACEBO BY THE MEDIA AND INDUSTRY FRONT GROUPS ALIKE. WHEN FURTHER ANALYSIS WILL SHOW SERIES OF EVENTS IN THE ADJUVANT AND VACCINE GROUPS.

TO I DON'T SEE IT BUT- THE COLD AND THE REIMBURSEMENT I'M HEARING A LOT ABOUT- THE VACCINE AND PEOPLE ARE USING THE LANGUAGE VACCINE. AND I FEEL COMPELLED TO SAY THAT THIS IS NOT A TRUE VACCINE IT IS MRNA TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION ONLY. TRADITIONAL VACCINES CONTAIN CHOPPED UP PIECES OF THE VIRUS SO THAT THE RECIPIENT CAN GET IMMUNITY WITHOUT GETTING THE DISEASE. THE MRNA CODE VACCINE CONTAINS GENETIC SOFTWARE THAT CAUSES THE RECIPIENT CELLS TO MANUFACTURE THE NTIGEN ON THEIR OWN WHICH THEY HOPE BUT THEY'RE NOT SURE YET. WELL THEN CAUSE AN IMMUNE RESPONSE IT'S A COOL IDEA BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF IT WORKS OR NOT. BOTH ARE UNPROVEN AND HAVE NOT COMPLETED CLINICAL TRIALS. BECAUSE WHO NEEDS CLINICAL TRIALS WHEN YOU HAVE THE WHOLE WORLD TO TEST THIS THEORY ON. THE FIZER AND MADERA ARE BOTH MRNA TREATMENTS THEY ARE NOT TRUE VACCINES AND THESE COMPANIES ARE TRADED ON WALL STREET WITH HEDGE FUNDS BEING THE MAIN SHAREHOLDERS. AND THEY FUNCTION BY REPROGRAMMING THE RECIPIENT CELLS AT THE CYTOPLASM LEVEL. AND THIS TREATMENT IS ONLY A FEW YEARS OLD. AND SO WE'RE ASKING THE POPULATION. TO TAKE A NEW GENETIC.
