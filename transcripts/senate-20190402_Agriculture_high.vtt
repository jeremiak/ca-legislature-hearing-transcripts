TAKEN A FORMAL POSITION BUT AS

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:08.761
AMENDED WE THINK THE BILL AS A

00:07:08.828 --> 00:07:10.797
VERY POSITIVE STEP IN ALLOWING

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:12.799
FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A

00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:13.966
COMMUNITY SOURCED.

00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:15.868
I BANKS AND THE WHILE STILL

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:16.869
ALLOWING THE TWO EXISTING BLOOD

BANKS TO CONTINUE THEIR

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:19.772
OPERATIONS ARE VETERINARIAN FEEL

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:21.808
VERY STRONGLY THAT COMPLETING

00:07:21.874 --> 00:07:23.476
SHUTTING THEM DOWN WOULD BE.

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:25.311
A REAL PROBLEM AND SO ALLOWING

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:27.513
IT -- TO TO GO FORWARD WE THINK

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.182

NEXT WITNESS.

00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:36.923
GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:38.357
MEMBERS CHAT BRIEFLY ****

00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:40.126
GREENBERG TRAURIG ON BEHALF OF

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:42.695
ANIMAL BLOOD BANK -- ANIMAL

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:44.630
BLOOD BANK IS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF

00:07:44.697 --> 00:07:46.299
COMMUNITY SOURCED BLOOD BANKING

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:48.334
IN FACT THEY OPERATE A COMMUNITY

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:49.902
SOURCED BLOOD BANK IN MICHIGAN --

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.404
I WOULD TELL YOU THAT THERE IS A

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.772
SHORTAGE OF BLOOD NOT ONLY IN

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:53.906
CALIFORNIA.

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:55.575
BUT THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:56.509
WERE COMMUNITY FORCED BLOOD

00:07:56.576 --> 00:08:00.880
BANKS OPERATE SO WE WELCOME --

00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:02.215
QUALITY BLOOD TO THE MARKET.

00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:03.149
I'M WILL DO OUR BEST TO SUPPORT

00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:04.217
COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS.

00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:05.751
A WE DO HAVE THREE CONCERNS

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:08.120
ABOUT THE BILL PRINCIPALLY THAT --

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:09.655
THE CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTION

00:08:09.722 --> 00:08:12.058
THAT EXISTS IN IN CURRENT LAW

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:13.259
AND THAT IS PROPOSED FOR THE

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:14.627
COMMUNITY SOURCE BLOOD BANKS

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:16.128
NEEDS TO BE CONTINUED.

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:18.564
I'M FOR REASONS THAT WERE CLEAR

00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:19.131
TWENTY YEARS AGO AND REMAIN

00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:19.932
TODAY.

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:22.935
I'M ALSO HAD THE BILL WOULD

00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:23.169
CHANGE.

00:08:23.236 --> 00:08:25.338
THE LICENSING REQUIREMENT FROM A

00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:28.140
PERSON QUALIFIED TO RUN A BLOOD

00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:30.710
BANK TO A LICENSED VETERINARIAN

00:08:30.776 --> 00:08:32.812
THAT IS BOTH A TOO STRINGENT

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:34.580
INTO ENGINE TO LENIENT IN THAT

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:35.815
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:37.250
VETERINARIAN TO RUN A BLOOD BANK.

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:38.484
AND JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE A

00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:39.886
VETERINARIAN DOESN'T MEAN YOU

00:08:39.952 --> 00:08:41.153
CAN'T RUN A BLOOD BANK.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.456
SO WE THINK EXISTING LAWS PINE

00:08:43.522 --> 00:08:45.191
AN EXISTING LAW ALSO REQUIRES

00:08:45.258 --> 00:08:46.993
OVERSIGHT BY A LICENSED

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:49.462
VETERINARIAN SO-- HAVING IT RUN

00:08:49.528 --> 00:08:50.630
BY A BY A LICENSED VETERINARIAN

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:53.199
IS DUPLICATIVE.

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:54.934
AND FINALLY.

00:08:55.001 --> 00:08:55.735
THERE'S A PROVISION IN EXISTING

00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:56.936
LAW THAT TALKS ABOUT THE MAXIMUM

00:08:57.003 --> 00:08:57.436
LENGH OF TIME.

00:08:57.503 --> 00:08:58.938
A DONATION IN THE BILL WOULD

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:02.575
CHANGE -- THE WORD OR TAKE AND

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:04.477
THAT PROVISION WAS PUT THERE TO

00:09:04.543 --> 00:09:05.878
ACCOMMODATE THE TWO EXISTING

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:09.415
BLOOD BANKS ONE OF WHICH RELIES

00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:12.351

00:09:12.418 --> 00:09:13.586
EIGHT THEY TAKE.

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:15.988

RESCUED ANIMALS -- AND NOW HAS

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:30.636
TO USE BRED ANIMALS BECAUSE OF

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:32.071
RESCUE ANIMALS ARE NO LONGER

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:33.739
AVAILABLE TO THEM BUT THOSE

00:09:33.806 --> 00:09:35.107
ANIMALS DONATE WHILE THEY'RE

00:09:35.174 --> 00:09:35.975
HEALTHY.

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:37.410
AND WHEN THEY'RE NOT HEALTHY

00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:39.779
THEY CONTINUE ON AS PART OF THE

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:40.346
PACK.
