00:57:24.207 --> 00:57:26.075
DIFFICULT TO COME UP WITH SOME

HOWEVER WHEN THE- OFFICE OF

01:01:16.572 --> 01:01:18.574
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW DETERMINES

01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:21.778
THAT A STATE AGENCY. SIR WORKS

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:22.278
UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:24.814
GOVERNOR ISSUE SOMETHING THAT

01:01:24.881 --> 01:01:25.948
YOU DETERMINED TO BE AN

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:27.350
UNDERGROUND REGULATION IN OTHER

01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:29.519
WORDS IT WAS IMPROPERLY

01:01:29.585 --> 01:01:31.521
PROMULGATED AND SHE WAS IN THE

01:01:31.587 --> 01:01:33.823
AGENCY FAILED TO FOLLOW THE

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:35.725
PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN THE

01:01:35.792 --> 01:01:37.326
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT.

01:01:37.393 --> 01:01:43.132
WHY SHOULD. SOMEONE THIRD PARTY

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:43.666
HAVE TO GO TO THE SUPERIOR

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:47.537

THAT REGULATION. VERY FOR

01:01:49.605 --> 01:01:51.240
QUESTION WHY SHOULDN'T WHY

01:01:51.307 --> 01:01:52.942
SHOULDN'T THE ADMINISTRATION ON

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:56.112

01:01:56.179 --> 01:01:57.713
CORRECT SOMETHING THAT IS

01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:00.283

DETERMINED TO BE IMPROPER. A

01:02:05.254 --> 01:02:08.024
FAIR QUESTION- I DO REPORT-

01:02:08.091 --> 01:02:09.158
BOTH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:10.793
GOVERNOR OPERATIONS WHEN THESE

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.361
OCCURRENCES HAPPEN IN MOST

01:02:12.428 --> 01:02:14.630
INSTANCES WE FIND THAT THE

01:02:14.697 --> 01:02:16.566
AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT- WHEN WE

01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:18.468
MADE A DETERMINATION-

01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:20.269

01:02:20.336 --> 01:02:22.105

NO LONGER BE ENFORCING THOSE-

01:02:25.174 --> 01:02:26.976
IT'S VERY RARE AND HASN'T

01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:27.944
HAPPENED SINCE I'VE BEEN THE

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:28.678
DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE

01:02:28.744 --> 01:02:30.713
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW- WHERE AN

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:32.849
AGENCY HAS. REFUSED TO

01:02:32.915 --> 01:02:34.083
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE FOUND THAT

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:36.419
IT'S AN UNDERGROUND REGULATION-

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:37.286
BUT THEY'RE ALSO SHOULD BE THAT

01:02:37.353 --> 01:02:38.554
BROADER OPPORTUNITY IT

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:40.823
SHOULDN'T JUST BE WITHIN- ELVES

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:42.692
ARE SMALL RESOURCES- INDIVIDUAL

01:02:42.758 --> 01:02:43.626
SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:44.861
SUPERIOR COURT TO ENFORCE THEIR

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:46.262
RIGHTS WHEN I MAY DISAGREE WITH

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:48.264

TAKE THAT TO THE COURT CERTAIN

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:51.067
RIGHT BUT IN THE CASES WHERE

01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:52.235
THERE'S NO DISAGREEMENT WHERE

01:02:52.301 --> 01:02:53.803
YOU'VE ISSUED A DETERMINATION

01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:55.037
THAT THE REGULATION IS AN

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:57.140
UNDERGROUND REGULATION AND WAS

01:02:57.206 --> 01:02:59.041
IMPROPERLY PROMULGATED UNDER

THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES

01:03:00.209 --> 01:03:02.612
ACT. IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU

01:03:02.678 --> 01:03:04.480
FIND THAT THERE ARE NO CHIP

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:06.415
