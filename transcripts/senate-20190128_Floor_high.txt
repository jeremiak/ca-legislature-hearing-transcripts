TO PRESENT THIS RESOLUTION COMMEMORATING THAT FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ORAL SPILL WHICH BEGAN ON JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTH. NINETEEN SIXTY NINE BUT CONTINUED FOR WEEKS. AND THEN MONTHS THERE AFTER. SPILLING AN ESTIMATED THREE TO FOUR MILLION GALLONS OF CRUDE OIL. ALONG THE COAST OF SANTA BABARA DOWN THROUGH A GREAT PORTION OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IT COMPLETELY DESTROYED AND TO SPOIL THE COASTLINE KILLED THOUSANDS OF MARINE LIFE AND WILDLIFE. AND CREATED WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE. THE BEGINNING OF THE MODERN ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT. NOW. A NEWLY DRILLED WELL FROM PLATFORM A IN SANTA BARBARA. BECAUSE THIS FIRE EXCUSE ME THE OIL WELL. IT FAILED CONTAINMENT. THUS BEGINNING THE SURGE OF THOSE MILLIONS OF GALLONS. IT FAILED BECAUSE THE OPERATOR AT THAT TIME UNION OIL. WAS MORE INTERESTED IN SECURING A FEDERAL WAIVER TO AVOID SAFETY REGULATIONS SUCH AS REQUIREMENTS FOR STEEL CASING REINFORCEMENT THAT COULD HAVE PREVENTED. THIS TRAGEDY IT WAS MORE INTERESTED IN THAT THEN IT WAS INTERESTED IN PROPERLY SECURING ITS WELL. AN ACTUAL RESULT WE SAW THIS DEVASTATION. TO OUR ECONOMY TO OUR NATURAL RESOURCE AND TO THE WILDLIFE. AND TO THE BIRDS AND OTHER SANCTUARY. OF THE CREATURES THAT WE AS STEWARDS OF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE PRESERVING AND PROTECTING. AND WHAT WE DO THOUGH.

AN ORGANIZATION THAT EXISTS TO THIS DAY AND THE COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTAL COUNCIL AMONG OTHER GROUPS. THIS BEGAN THE BEGINNING OF BIRTHDAY. AND HOPEFULLY. AS WE LOOK PROACTIVELY INTO THE FUTURE WE WILL RECOGNIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. THAT WE ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM THAT WE REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCE ON OIL WHETHER RICH -- DRILLED OFFSHORE OR ON SURE MAINTENANCE THAT THIS STATE HAS LED THE NATION. IN SEEKING TO ACHIEVE TO BECOME. OUR ENERGY INDEPENDENT USING ALTERNATIVE CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES THAT WE STOP BACKSLIDING THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE CLIMATE CHANGES IN MANY INSTANCES THE RESULT OF BURNING OF THESE FOSSIL FUELS. AND I NOTE I MENTION DEBRIS FLOW AND FIRE. BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS ALSO AFFECTED MY COMMUNITY AND LIKELY MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND AS WE LOOK FORWARD WE ARE SEEING THAT THE MIDDLE OF THIS COUNTRY THIS WEEK WILL BE EXPERIENCING THE COLDEST WEATHER. THAT IT HAS EXPERIENCED IN DECADES IF WE DO NOT REALIZE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE RESPONSIBILITY OF FOSSIL FUELS IN THAT MEASURE THAT WE ARE DESTINED TO REPEAT THESE PROBLEMS.
