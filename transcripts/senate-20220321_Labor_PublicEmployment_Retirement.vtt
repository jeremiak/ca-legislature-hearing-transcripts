THERE IS ANY CHANCE FOR PUBLIC-

00:15:23.622 --> 00:15:24.890
FOR THAT PUBLIC EMPLOYEES TO FIX

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:27.926
A PROBLEM BEFORE- IT IS AN ISSUE

00:15:27.993 --> 00:15:29.028
WOULD YOU BE OPPOSED TO

00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:30.062

PERMIT SO THAT THEY CAN ISSUE A

00:15:38.237 --> 00:15:39.004
WARNING. THERE'S NOT ALWAYS A

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:41.540
RIGHT HERE- AND IN THIS CASE IF

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:43.509
THERE WAS A RIGHT TO CURE THE

00:15:43.575 --> 00:15:44.543
DAMAGE WOULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.612
DONE. BECAUSE ONCE A AN EMPLOYER

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:50.015
HAS BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF- DO YOU

00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:52.551
ANTI UNION- RHETORIC OR ANTI

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:55.554
UNION- SPEECH OR PAPERWORK OR

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:57.623
POSTINGS OR MEETINGS WITH TEIR

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.792
EMPLOYEES RIGHT NOW WITH THE

00:15:59.858 --> 00:16:00.793
CURRENT LAW SAYS IS THAT THEY

00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:02.628
JUST HAVE TO POST INTO A CEASE

00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:03.962
AND DESIST. MANY TIMES IT CAN

00:16:04.029 --> 00:16:05.764
TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE THAT

00:16:05.831 --> 00:16:07.466
SEASON THIS IS THE MAIN PURPOSE

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:09.668
EVEN PUT UP AND THE PROBLEM IS

00:16:09.735 --> 00:16:11.437
THE DAMAGE IS DONE WHAT WE WANT

00:16:11.503 --> 00:16:13.405
TO DO IS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:14.773
THAT THERE'S A PENALTY. SO THAT

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.809
EMPLOYERS DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT

00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:17.943
INFRINGING ON WORKERS RIGHT TO

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.012
FORM A UNION UP WORKERS FEDERAL

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:22.848
RIGHT TO FORM. SO WOULD YOU MIND

00:16:22.915 --> 00:16:23.582
EDUCATING ME BECAUSE I DON'T

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:24.883
KNOW THE PROCESS OF WHAT HAPPENS

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.151
WHEN SOMEBODY ACTUALLY DOES

00:16:26.218 --> 00:16:27.619
SOMETHING OF THIS SORT WHICH IS

00:16:27.686 --> 00:16:28.787
THE CURRENT PROCESS ON THAT AND-

00:16:28.854 --> 00:16:30.656
IT GOES TO PERM. AND THEN

00:16:30.723 --> 00:16:32.925
PERMANENT A RULING OR FINDINGS

00:16:32.991 --> 00:16:34.793
AND THEN IF THEY ARE FOUND THE

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.328
EMPLOYER IS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:39.531
<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;UILTY. OF ANTI UNION ACTIVITIES&lt;/c&gt;</u>

00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:41.166
THEN THEY POST A CEASE AND

00:16:41.233 --> 00:16:42.835
DESIST USUALLY IN THE EMPLOYEE

00:16:42.901 --> 00:16:44.403
BREAK ROOM BUT THAT CAN TAKE

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.705
MANY MANY MONTHS AND LIKE I SAID

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:47.873
BEFORE THE DAMAGE HAS ALREADY

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.608
BEEN DONE. THE EMPLOYEE HE HAS

00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:50.843
ALREADY HEARD ALL OF THE

00:16:50.909 --> 00:16:52.811
RHETORIC AND ALL OF THE ANTI

00:16:52.878 --> 00:16:54.113
UNIONS FEEL SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:58.951
TO DO IS PUT IN A PENALTY TO

00:16:59.017 --> 00:17:00.386

00:44:43.747 --> 00:44:45.382
BE THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME

00:44:45.449 --> 00:44:47.351

00:44:55.092 --> 00:44:57.361
WCI THE CALIFORNIA. WORKERS

00:44:57.428 --> 00:44:58.362
COMPENSATION INSTITUTE DID A

00:44:58.429 --> 00:45:02.433
BRIEF. PERCENT OF CLAIMS

NINETY. 97% OF CLAIMS ARE

00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:12.576
GO BEYOND THE NINETY DAYS

00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:13.710
USUALLY. I'LL TALK ABOUT THIS IN

00:45:13.777 --> 00:45:15.512
A MINUTE IT'S A RESULT OF THE

00:45:15.579 --> 00:45:16.947
PROCESS THAT WE HAVE TO

00:45:17.014 --> 00:45:19.283
UNDERTAKE- YOU REDUCE THAT TO

00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:21.185

ONLY 37% OF THEM HAVE A DECISION

00:45:31.095 --> 00:45:32.930
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND THIS IS

00:45:32.996 --> 00:45:34.631
FOR A REASON. I'M ONE OF THE

00:45:34.698 --> 00:45:36.200
CLAIMS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY

00:45:36.266 --> 00:45:37.067

MEDICALLY AND FACTUALLY OKAY SO

00:45:40.003 --> 00:45:41.872
WE HAVE TO DO AN ACTUAL

00:45:41.939 --> 00:45:43.407
INVESTIGATION- THAT IS DETAILED

00:45:43.474 --> 00:45:45.175
IN NATURE. AND THEN SECOND THE

00:45:45.242 --> 00:45:46.577
LAWS AND THE REGULATIONS OF THE

00:45:46.643 --> 00:45:48.145
STATE. DICTATE THE PROCESS OF

00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:49.680
THE INVESTIGATION AND I'M GONNA

00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:50.814
WALK YOU THROUGH THAT NOW.

00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:52.783
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT ALLOW US TO

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:54.952
CONDUCT. AN INVESTIGATION AND

00:45:55.018 --> 00:45:56.787
THIRTY OR SIXTY DAYS. SO I'M

00:45:56.854 --> 00:45:58.222
FIRST AND FOREMOST- THE

00:45:58.288 --> 00:45:59.456
REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT

00:45:59.523 --> 00:46:00.958
EMPLOYERS- PROVIDE A

00:46:01.024 --> 00:46:02.392
COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION WE

ARE NOT ALLOWED TO RESTRICT THE

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:06.029
INVESTIGATION ONLY. TO PREPARING

00:46:06.096 --> 00:46:07.664
OBJECTIONS WE NEED TO LOOK AT

00:46:07.731 --> 00:46:08.832
ALL OF THE INFORMATION WE MUST

00:46:08.899 --> 00:46:11.135

00:46:11.201 --> 00:46:13.303
THE PERTINENT INFORMATION- AND

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:15.139
WHETHER IT REQUIRES OR EXCUSES

00:46:15.205 --> 00:46:17.541
BENEFITS. AND THEN WE'VE GOT TO

00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:18.709

TIME TO COME BACK- AND THEN

00:46:35.926 --> 00:46:37.694
ULTIMATELY IF THE IF THE CLAIM

00:46:37.761 --> 00:46:39.696
IS GOING TO BE. DENIED BASED ON

00:46:39.763 --> 00:46:41.832
A MEDICAL REASON YOU'VE GOT TO

00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:56.113
HERE'S- WHAT THE REGULATIONS AND

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:59.483
STATUTES SAY TODAY AND THIS IS

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:00.851
UNCHANGED BY THE CURRENT BILL.

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:02.653
ONCE A CLAIM IS FILED THE WORKER

00:47:02.719 --> 00:47:04.421

WE CAN EVEN REQUEST THE PANEL.

00:47:09.793 --> 00:47:11.128
THE STATE THEN HAS TEN DAYS TO

00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:12.696
SEND US THE PANEL. THEN WE HAVE

PICK A DOCTOR BEFORE WE CAN

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:16.767
PICK. THE THIRTY DAYS IS OVER

00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:18.569
RIGHT THERE. UNDER THE SPELL ON

00:47:18.635 --> 00:47:20.971
PRESUMPTIVE CLAIMS. IT'S DONE WE

00:47:21.038 --> 00:47:23.040
CAN NO LONGER PROCEED THE THIRTY

00:47:23.106 --> 00:47:24.541
DAYS IS OVER WE HAVEN'T EVEN

00:47:24.608 --> 00:47:25.542
GOTTEN THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF

00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:27.578
THE STATE'S PROCESS. ONCE A

00:47:27.644 --> 00:47:28.912
DOCTOR IS SELECTED AN

00:47:28.979 --> 00:47:30.047
APPOINTMENT IS SUPPOSED TO BE

00:47:30.113 --> 00:47:31.949
SCHEDULED WITHIN SIXTY DAYS. AND

00:47:32.015 --> 00:47:33.417

DELIVERED THIRTY DAYS AFTER

00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:36.220
THAT. SO WE'RE A HUNDRED AND

00:47:36.286 --> 00:47:37.454
TWENTY DAYS INTO THE PROCESS

00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:38.789
JUST BASED ON THE STATE

00:47:38.855 --> 00:47:40.824
REGULATORY STRUCTURE THIS ISN'T

00:47:40.891 --> 00:47:42.759
AN EMPLOYER STRUCTURE THIS IS

00:47:42.826 --> 00:47:43.560
THE LEGISLATURE STRUCTURE AND

00:47:43.627 --> 00:47:46.763
IT'S THE- DIVISION OF WORKERS

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:48.265
COMPENSATION STRUCTURE. ON TOP

00:47:48.332 --> 00:47:50.601
OF THAT THE STATE AUDITOR DID A

00:47:50.667 --> 00:47:52.502
PANEL AT. AN AUDIT OF THE Q. I.

00:47:52.569 --> 00:47:54.504
ME PROCESS A FEW YEARS AGO- AND

00:47:54.571 --> 00:47:56.006
FOUND THAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT

00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:57.774
THERE WERE- THE NUMBER OF-

00:47:57.841 --> 00:47:59.109
INCREASE WERE UP THIRTY. THE

00:47:59.176 --> 00:48:00.744
NUMBER OF PANEL REQUESTS WAS

00:48:00.811 --> 00:48:02.479
INCREASED THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT.

00:48:02.546 --> 00:48:03.847
THE NUMBER OF DOCTORS AVAILABLE

00:48:03.914 --> 00:48:05.449
WAS DOWN TWELVE PERCENT. THE

00:48:05.515 --> 00:48:07.417
PROCESS IS MOVING SLOWER AND THE

00:48:07.484 --> 00:48:09.386
REPORT QUALITY IS SLOW. SO THIS

00:48:09.453 --> 00:48:10.921
IS THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE

00:48:10.988 --> 00:48:11.955

SIMPLY ADHERE TO IT. MMHM THE

00:48:19.096 --> 00:48:20.797
CURRENT BILL CHANGES NONE OF

00:48:20.864 --> 00:48:22.532
THESE DETAILS IT SIMPLY SAYS DO

00:48:22.599 --> 00:48:24.401
IT FASTER WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY

00:48:24.468 --> 00:48:26.470

JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES. GPS OR

00:48:51.895 --> 00:48:52.996
THE NOT FOR PROFIT MECHANISM

00:48:53.063 --> 00:48:54.431
THAT MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS USE

00:48:54.498 --> 00:48:56.466
TO EFFECTIVELY SELL FUNDS ARE

00:48:56.533 --> 00:48:58.201

THEY ARE SAFELY ABLE TO DO SO.

00:49:06.677 --> 00:49:08.111
THIS BILL DRAMATICALLY DECREASES

00:49:08.178 --> 00:49:10.047
STATUTORY TIME FRAMES. FOR AN

00:49:30.267 --> 00:49:32.202
EMPLOYERS MAY BE FORCED TO DENY

A NIGHTMARE FOR THE INJURED

BEING ORDERED TO REPORT DURING

01:54:55.688 --> 01:54:56.789
THE GETTING FIRED THAT WOULD OF

01:54:56.856 --> 01:54:58.625
COURSE BE PROHIBITED NOW UNDER

01:54:58.691 --> 01:55:00.760
THE LAW PASSED TWO YEARS AGO- OR

01:55:00.827 --> 01:55:01.761
IF THERE'S A WORKER YOU KNOW

01:55:01.828 --> 01:55:03.563
WHEN THERE'S A FIRE BLAZING NEXT

01:55:03.630 --> 01:55:04.764
DOOR ANOTHER IMMINENT DANGER WE

01:55:04.831 --> 01:55:05.898
THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY ILLEGAL

01:55:05.965 --> 01:55:07.533
RIGHT NOW TO MAKE THAT WORK OR

01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:09.035
CONTINUE TO WORK. WE THINK

01:55:09.102 --> 01:55:10.370
THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE AND THE

01:55:10.436 --> 01:55:11.771
EMPLOYER SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE

01:55:11.838 --> 01:55:13.606
HELD ACCOUNTABLE. I'M SO OUR

01:55:13.673 --> 01:55:15.975
CONCERN- TEN FORTY FOUR IS

01:55:16.042 --> 01:55:17.644
LARGELY TWO FOLD- AS A COMEDIAN

01:55:17.710 --> 01:55:19.846
HOUSES NOTES IN A STATE OF

01:55:19.912 --> 01:55:20.880
EMERGENCY CAN LAST FOR A LONG

01:55:20.947 --> 01:55:22.582
TIME BEYOND WHEN THE DANGER IS

01:55:22.649 --> 01:55:24.417
PRESENT. AND WHILE WE APPRECIATE

01:55:24.484 --> 01:55:25.852
THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO

01:55:25.918 --> 01:55:26.853
ADDRESS THIS WE DO STILL HAVE

01:55:26.919 --> 01:55:28.788
SOME CONCERNS. ABOUT THE USE OF

01:55:28.855 --> 01:55:30.323
THE LANGUAGE OF THE EMERGENCY

01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:31.858
BEING ONGOING WHICH WE THINK IS

01:55:31.924 --> 01:55:33.459
VERY GOOD AND COULD COVER SOME

01:55:33.526 --> 01:55:35.028
EMERGENCIES SUCH AS WILDFIRES

01:55:35.094 --> 01:55:36.629
SMOKE OR OTHERS THAT DO LAST

01:55:36.696 --> 01:55:37.964
POTENTIALLY FOR A VERY LONG

01:55:38.031 --> 01:55:40.233
TIME. EVEN MORE CAL OSHA HAS

01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:41.668
DENIED THAT IT IS SAFE TO GO TO

01:55:41.734 --> 01:55:43.903
WORK. A SECOND AND PROBABLY THE

01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:45.171
BIGGEST CONCERN WE HAVE THE BILL

01:55:45.238 --> 01:55:46.906
IS THAT IT GIVES LARGE

01:55:46.973 --> 01:55:47.807
DISCRETION TO EMPLOYEES THAT IF

01:55:47.874 --> 01:55:52.378
THEY WALK AWAY FROM A COMPLETELY

01:55:52.445 --> 01:55:53.346
SAFE WORKPLACE. THERE'S NOTHING

01:55:53.413 --> 01:55:55.348
THERE WE ARE CAN DO. RISK A

01:55:55.415 --> 01:55:56.516
LOSS. HEALTH CARE WORKERS FIRST

01:55:56.582 --> 01:55:57.917
RESPONDERS YOUR OWN LEGISLATIVE

01:55:57.984 --> 01:55:58.618
STAFF COULD WALK AWAY TODAY. IF

01:55:58.685 --> 01:56:01.220
THIS BILL IS IN EFFECT IF THEY

01:56:01.287 --> 01:56:01.921
SAY ANYTHING IS UNSAFE. THE FACT

01:56:01.988 --> 01:56:03.623
THAT THE EMPLOYER IS FOLLOWING

01:56:03.690 --> 01:56:04.590
APPROPRIATE LAWS- IS GOING EVEN

01:56:04.657 --> 01:56:06.726
ABOVE AND BEYOND IS RELEVANT TO

01:56:06.793 --> 01:56:08.561
THE FACT THAT CAL OSHA OR CD PH

01:56:08.628 --> 01:56:09.896
OR WHOEVER SAYS IT IS SAFE TO

01:56:09.962 --> 01:56:10.863
WORK. IS COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT

01:56:10.930 --> 01:56:12.231
THE BILL TAKES THE POWER

01:56:12.298 --> 01:56:13.599
COMPLETELY OUT OF THOSE AGENCIES

01:56:13.666 --> 01:56:15.802
HANDS. AS FAR AS WHAT

01:56:15.868 --> 01:56:16.903
CONSTITUTES A SAFER PLACE.

01:56:16.969 --> 01:56:19.138
FINALLY JUST A PIECE ON

01:56:19.205 --> 01:56:19.739
ENFORCEMENT- THE BILL IS

01:56:19.806 --> 01:56:21.441
ENFORCEABLE UNDER PROJECT. I'M

01:56:21.507 --> 01:56:22.508
PRESENTLY IF YOU HAVE A

01:56:22.575 --> 01:56:24.477
VIOLATION UNDER PAGA FOR

01:56:24.544 --> 01:56:26.512
VIOLATION OF THE HEALTH OR

01:56:26.579 --> 01:56:27.580
SAFETY STATUTE- YOU ARE SUPPOSED

01:56:27.647 --> 01:56:29.148
TO. FOLLOW A DIFFERENT PROCEDURE

01:56:29.215 --> 01:56:30.717
BY WHICH WE MUST HAVE THE

01:56:30.783 --> 01:56:31.984
DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATED- BEFORE

01:56:32.051 --> 01:56:33.753
YOU CAN FILE A LAWSUIT. AND

01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:35.521
BECAUSE THIS DOES NOT PUT THIS

01:56:35.588 --> 01:56:37.023
CODE SECTION IN THAT SAME

01:56:37.090 --> 01:56:38.424
DIVISION AS THE REST OF THE

01:56:38.491 --> 01:56:39.625
HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE IT WOULD

NOT BE SUBJECT TO THAT SAME

01:56:41.761 --> 01:56:42.628
PROCEDURE. WHICH IS ACTUALLY

01:56:42.695 --> 01:56:43.563
WORSE FOR WORKERS BECAUSE

01:56:43.629 --> 01:56:44.764
INSTEAD OF GETTING A CITATION

01:56:44.831 --> 01:56:46.165
IMMEDIATELY THEY WOULD HAVE TO

01:56:46.232 --> 01:56:47.934
WAIT MONTHS RESOLUTION OF A

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:48.968
LOSS. TO ADDRESS AT THE VERY

01:56:49.035 --> 01:56:53.039

01:56:53.106 --> 01:56:53.639
