GOING TO GO AHEAD AND START AS A SUB COMMITTEE WHILE WE WAIT TO- FOR OTHER MEMBERS SAID TO COME I WANT TO WELCOME EVERYONE TO OUR FIRST HEARING OF THE TWENTY TWENTY LEGISLATIVE YEAR AND WE'RE GOING TO START OFF TODAY- WITH A SOME MEMBER HAWKING AND I'M GLAD I'M- SENDING. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY ONE. THE MELENDEZ AS CO AUTHOR OF AB FIFTEEN FIFTY ONE. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY ONE PROPOSES TO THE PROPERTY. WELL KNOWN AS PAYS FINANCING. PAYS FINANCING WAS INITIALLY ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AS A WAY TO HELP HOMEOWNERS FINANCE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY HOME IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS UNFORTUNATELY AT THE TIME OF. ITS ADOPTION THERE WERE VERY FEW CONSUMER PROTECTIONS PLACED IN THE PROGRAM AS A RESULT THE LEGISLATURE HAS HAD TO ADOPT CONSUMER WERE. PROTECTIONS AFTER THE FACT LEAVING CONSUMERS VULNERABLE TO FRAUD. TWO YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AB TWENTY SIXTY THREE WHICH INCREASED ACCOUNTABILITY OVERSIGHT AND RESPONSIBLE LENDING. DESPITE THE LEGISLATURE'S EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ACCOUNTABILITY THERE CONTINUE TO BE REPORTS FROM HOMEOWNERS HOMEOWNERS WHO SIGNED CONTRACTS BUT ARE UNAWARE OF THE IMPACT THE PEACE ASSESSMENT WOULD HAVE ON THEIR TAX BILL. AND THE ABILITY TO REFINANCE OR SELL THEIR HOMES HOMEOWNERS MAY EVEN BE UNAWARE THAT THEY COULD LOSE THEIR HOMES IF THEY FAILED TO PAY PAYS ASSESSMENT. MANY HOMEOWNERS DON'T REALIZE THAT DEFAULTING ON THIS ASSESSMENT COULD PUT THEM IN DANGER OF LOSING THEIR HOMES. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY ONE PROPOSES THREE CHANGES TO THIS PROGRAM INTENDED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER PROTECTION. FIRST IT REQUIRES PIECE CONTRACTORS TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH A HARD COPY OF THE CONTRACT PRIOR TO WORK COMMENCING. RECENTLY THE LA CITY ATTORNEY FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE PACE CONTRACTOR TH CONTRACTOR WAS ACCUSED OF DEFRAUDING LOW INCOME RESIDENTS BY USING THEIR LAPTOPS AND CELL PHONES TO ACCESS ONLINE APPLICATIONS AND ONLY FLASHING LIMITED SNIPPETS OF INFORMATION OUT THERE VICTIMS FROM THEIR SCREENS. REQUIRING A HARD COPY PAPER DISCLOSURE FORM WILL PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONDITIONS OF THE FINANCING AND WILL ENSURE THAT HOMEOWNERS GET THE INFORMATION AND BOTH ELECTRONIC AND HARD COPY FORM. CERTAINLY A HARD COPY WILL ALLOW THE PROPERTY OWNER TO READILY SHARE THE DOCUMENT WITH TRUSTED RELATIVES AND FRIENDS. THIS DISCLOSURE SHOULD BE WELCOMED BY THE PACE PROVIDERS WHO ARE FOLLOWING THE RULES AS A WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT THE HOMEOWNER UNDERSTANDS THE CONTRACT. SECOND THIS BILL PROHIBITS PACE ADMINISTRATORS FROM CHARGING CONSUMERS A PENALTY FOR PAYING OFF THEIR ASSESSMENT EARLY. THERE ARE FIVE PIECE ADMINISTRATORS THAT OFFER FINANCING IN CALIFORNIA. MOST OF THEM HAVE ELIMINATED THE EARLY PAYOFF PENALTY BUT THIS BILL WILL PUT THAT PRACTICE TO END FOR GOOD. THE EARLY PAYOFF PENALTY SIMPLY INCREASES THE COST OF FINANCING AND IS NOT A STANDARD PRACTICE USED BY TRADITIONAL LENDING INSTITUTION. IT ALSO ROBS HOMEOWNER HOME OWNERS OF HARD EARNED EQUITY IN THEIR HOME WHEN THEY ARE SELLING OR REFINANCING PROPERTIES. FINALLY THIS BILL WILL PROHIBIT PACE ADMINISTRATORS FROM CONTRACTING WITH HOMEOWNERS WHO HAVE WHO HAVE REVERSE MORTGAGES. PACE HOME IMPROVEMENT QUALIFY AS SUPER LEADS AGAINST RESIDENTS HOMES OFTEN BANKS ARE UNAWARE THAT RESIDENTS IN REVERSE MORTGAGES ARE TAKING ON THESE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. BECAUSE SUPERMAN'S TAKE PRIORITY AND MUST BE PAID OFF BEFORE A HOME CAN BE SOLD RESIDENTS MAY FURTHER LOSE EQUITY IN THEIR HOMES AND FIND THEMSELVES AND THAT. IN OCTOBER THE MINISTRY- IS ANNOUNCED THEY WOULD VOLUNTEER PLEASE STOP CONTRACTING WITH HOMEOWNERS WITH REVERSE MORTGAGES THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT THAT PRACTICE IS ENDED. IT IS MY HOPE THAT THIS BILL WILL BRING US ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE GOAL OF HOMEOWNERS WHO ENTER INTO PACE ASSESSMENT CONTRACTS. DOING SO WITH FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR ACTIONS AND MAKING PACE A BETTER PRODUCT FOR CONSUMERS WITHOUT A TYPICAL FEES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ANNA BACH AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS- THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALREADY DID A GREAT JOB OF AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT THIS BILL DOES- TO INTO THE MICROPHONE JUST A LITTLE CLOSER TO. SHORE PAYS PROGRAMS ARE UNIQUE FORM OF FINANCING SANCTIONED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ALLOW PROPERTY OWNERS TO FINANCE WATER AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY OR HOME HARDENING EFFORTS WITH A FEW NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS. FINANCING IS ADMINISTERED BY FOR PROFIT PRIVATE ENTERPRISE. YOU PROBABLY HEARD FROM THE BILL'S OPPONENTS THAT REALTORS JUST HATE PACE. WELL LET ME SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT STRAIGHT TODAY REALTORS DO NOT HATE PAYS FINANCING. WHAT REALTORS HATE. IS HEARING FROM HOMEOWNERS. THAT THEY WORK WITH TIME AND TIME AGAIN. THAT THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THEIR PACE ASSESSMENTS. THE MOST NOTABLE PART OF THIS BILL IS THE REQUIREMENT THAT A HARD COPY OF THE DISCLOSURE BE GIVEN TO POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS. IN PRACTICE PACE ASSESSMENT SALES ARE USUALLY DONE IN PERSON. DOOR TO DOOR SALES VIA THE USE OF ELECTRONIC TABLET SUCH AS AN IPAD. NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT. THERE IS AN INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH IN THE PACE BUSINESS MODEL BECAUSE PACE ADMINISTRATOR COMPANIES RELY ON THE CONTRACTORS WHO WILL BE INSTALLING THE PRODUCT TO SIGN CUSTOMERS UP FOR THE FINANCING. HOMEOWNERS ROUTINELY ELECTRONICALLY SIGN CONTRACTS THAT OBLIGATE THEMSELVES. TO TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FIFTY SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A MORE. OF ENCUMBRANCE ON THEIR PROPERTIES AT HIGH INTEREST RATES OF SIX AND A HALF TO EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT WITH A COPY SIMPLY GOING TO THEIR EMAIL ADDRESSES A HARD COPY INSTEAD OF AN EMAIL DISCLOSURE. WILL INCREASE THE CHANCES THAT A HOMEOWNER WILL READ THE DISCLOSURE THOROUGHLY AND LEARN ABOUT THE NUANCES OF THE FINANCING PRODUCT THAT THEY ARE CONSIDERING AND PERHAPS EQUALLY IMPORTANT. A DOCUMENT IN HAND THAT THEY CAN EASILY REVIEW AND DISCUSS WITH FRIENDS RELATIVES OR FINANCIAL COUNSELORS DURING THE THREE DAY RIGHT EVERY SCISSION PERIOD FOR THESE REASONS WE REQUEST I ABOUT THANK YOU THANK YOU. FOR YOUR TIME AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT OF. MY NAME IS LOU THIS THIS MEDINA FROM FRESNO CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY ORGANIZER AND TWO YEARS AGO I EMBARKED IN A COMMUNITY THAT WAS VULNERABLE AND THAT WAS DEFINITELY WANTING TO SAY THE VARMINT BY TAKING ON SOLAR LOANS. SO LOANS ARE THE WAY THEY GOT INTRODUCED INTO PACE LOANS BASIL'S PRESENTED TO THEM BY CONTRACTORS WHEN THE COMMUNITY IS NOT AFFLUENT AND DOESN'T HAVE AN EDUCATION OR EVEN A MIGRANT. A STATUS TO BE IN THE COMMUNITY TO ASK PEOPLE QUESTIONS OR ASK. OR TO KNOW WHAT QUESTIONS TO ASK THEY ARE USUALLY TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. AND THIS BILL I SEE THE VERY SMALL STEP THAT WE COULD TAKE THE STAR HELPING A LOT OF CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA JUST HERE LOAN I ONLY HELP ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH ISSUES OF HOW TO EVEN APPROACH. UNDERSTANDING A PACE SLOWED UNDERSTANDING HOW THEY COULD SAVE THEIR HOMES UNDERSTANDING IF THEY COULD GO TO SLEEP AGAIN AND KNOW THAT THEY WILL ALL THESE COMPANIES FAILED THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE THEIR HOMES. I SEE THAT ASSEMBLY MAN BRINGING FORTH THIS BILL WITH THE HARD COPY IS SOMETHING IS VERY SIMPLE OLD SCHOOL IS OLD SCHOOL WHEN YOU GO PURCHASE A CAR YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO PURCHASE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE A BIG RESPONSIBILITY. YOU GET TOLD THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT YOU TOLD INTRODUCING TO PAY HOW MANY YEARS YOU'RE GOING TO PAY IN THE TOTAL BALANCE WHEN PEOPLE ARE AWARE THAT. WILL MAKE SURE TO ASK MORE QUESTIONS BUT MAYBE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S A REALTOR SEC LOANS LIKE PACE. NEVER EVER TO DOES THE COUNTY ASSESSMENT TELL THE HOMEOWNER DO YOU UNDERSTAND. YOUR PROPERTY IS BEING SET AND WEBER SAYS THE. SO RIGHT NOW IS FOR ME FORTUNATELY. MAYBE HAD THE HOT THEIR HEART IN THE RIGHT PLACE BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THEIR KNOWLEDGE IN THE RIGHT PLACE. IT WE'RE THINKING THE- BILL RIGHT NOW WHO'S CURRENTLY FINALLY THIS YOU'RE GOING TO BE HELPING TO REGULATE THESE LOANS. IT'S GOING TO BE ENOUGH FOR US TO HELP THE CONSUMERS IT'S NOT. THIS BILL ONLY HELPS US TO MAKE SURE THE COMMUNITIES WHO ARE MIGRANT COMMUNITIES LOW INCOME IN FIRST A HOMEOWNERS THEY WANT TO BE HOMEOWNERS FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. KEEP THEIR HOMES PAYS LOANS RIGHT NOW ARE NOT BEING DISCLOSED TO CONSUMERS TO CALIFORNIANS WITH TRANSPARENCY. THERE IS A LOT OF BAD INFORMATION. AND BAD PRACTICES IT ALSO. NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FROM THE LENDERS AND THE CONTRACTORS THERE'S A LOT OF PARTIES INVOLVED IN THIS PAGE LOADS BUT ONLY ONE PARTY ENDS UP DAMAGE AND THAT'S THE HOMEOWNER. I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I. YOU AND WE WILL GO AHEAD AND ESTABLISH QUORUM AS THE OPPOSITION COMES. AT THE END IF WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND CARL. LEON HERE IN HERE CHAN CHAN HERE BEAR CAM CAME HERE BURKE CHOI. CHOI HERE GABRIEL CABLE HERE GLORIA. GRAYSON. GRAYSON HERE MELENDEZ MELENDEZ HERE STONE. STONE HERE WEBER. WEBER MEMBER HERE WICKS WICKS HERE.

WE URGE OUR AYE VOTE. AFTERNOON DELIGHT LE CLOWN BEHALF OF LA COUNTY IN SUPPORT. DANIEL GOOD TERRACE ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. ROBERT WILSON THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE IN SUPPORT. AT THE HILTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA LAND TITLE ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. PATTERNS AWAY HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS COMMINGLED WITH CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU SEEN NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AT WE WILL HAVE. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO STATE YOUR POSITION THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS- HI MY NAME'S JUSTIN STRAWN I WORK AT MORE GREEN ENERGY FUND- HANDS HERE TALK ABOUT FIFTEEN FIFTY ONE. ROUGHLY EVERY OPPOSE THE BILL BECAUSE THIS- THE LANGUAGE SIMPLY REMOVES THE OPTION FOR A PROPERTY OWNER TO RECEIVE THEIR PACE DOCUMENTS AN ELECTRONIC FORMAT. ACTUALLY WHAT'S ALREADY IN STATUTE IS THAT THE PROPERTY OWNER BE PROVIDED A PRINTED COPY AND LESS THE PROPERTY OWNER AGREES TO RECEIVE. THOSE DOCUMENTS IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT. I'M THERE'S BEEN SUITE OF LEGISLATION ALREADY PASSED- THAT IS ADDRESSED ALL OF THESE ISSUES AB TWENTY SIX NINETY THREE SB TWO FORTY TWO AB TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR- THEY'VE ALL ADDRESSED THESE COMPONENTS ESTABLISHING COMPREHENSIVE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. IN THE PACE INDUSTRY- AB TWO ALREADY FOR ESTABLISH THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT AS THE REGULATOR OF ALL RESIDENTIAL- PACE FINANCING ADMINISTRATORS. HAND OUT RIGHT NOW THEY ARE ACTIVELY- IN THE PROCESS OF RULE MAKING ADDRESSING THIS PARTICULAR COMPONENT WITH REGARD TO WRITTEN DISCLOSURES. AS ABOUT TO HOW WE HAVE TO PROVIDE- THESE DISCLOSURES INWHAT FORMAT IT'S ULTRA- AND AGAIN BY REQUIRING THAT THE DISCLOSURE ONLY BE PROVIDED IN PRINTED COPY REMOVES THE OPTION FOR THE PROPERTY OWNER TO ELECT AGAIN THEIR CHOICE JUST PROPERTY OUR CHOICE. TO RECEIVE THE DISCLOSURES AND THAT DOCUMENTATION AND ELECTRONIC FORMAT- AND AGAIN THIS IS CURRENTLY AN ACTIVE ROLE MAKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT SO. WE OPPOSE BILL FOR THAT FOR THAT REASON THANK YOU. ARE NOTHING TO ADD THANK YOU CRYSTAL PROPER FROM MY GREEN HERE I'M AS NEEDED CREEK THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE. INTERFERE WITH THE RENEW FINANCIAL WE CURRENTLY HAVE A POSITION OF OPPOSING LASSEN ENDED ARE WE AGREED- TWO THIRDS OF THE BILL WITH THE OFTEN THE SPONSORS SPECIFIC TO. NO PREMIUM PALE NO PREPAYMENT PENALTIES AS WELL AS THE- PART OF ME. THE GOOD THE STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTIONS RELATED TO THE PREPAYMENT AS WELL AS. SIMON OF TO. AND THE REVERSE MORTGAGES I APOLOGIZE THE ISSUE THAT- WE STILL HAVE AN ISSUE WITH IS RELATED TO THE HARD COPIES OF AS STATED EARLIER DPO IS CURRENTLY PROPAGATING REGULATED TO THAT I'M NOT REQUIRING THE HARD COPY- BUT IF THE CUSTOMER REQUESTS ARE BOTH FOR NEW FINANCIAL- WILL GRANT IT IN ADDITION- IT'S BEEN OUR EXPERIENCE THAT 98% OF FOR NEW FINANCIALS ARE RICH RENEW FINANCIAL. CUSTOMER DECLINE OF TEAMING UP TING IN A HARD HARD COPY- WE BELIEVE THESE THINGS CAN CONTINUE TO BE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR AND- AGAIN BELIEVE THAT'S VERY LAUDABLE OF THIS STRONGER CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR SEEKING IN THIS FOR THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MARCH BET PIECE FUNDING GROUP BY OPPOSING OPEN ENDED. ON THE PREPAYMENT PIECE WE SUPPORT THE- OVERALL OBJECTIVE BUT IT DOES NOT COVER PARTIAL PREPAYMENTS. IN THEORY A HOMEOWNER CAN MAKE A PARTIAL PREPAYMENT OF ONE DOLLAR. IT WOULD COST ME A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS TO FILE THE PAPERWORK WITH THE COUNTY TO RE ADVERTISE THAT ASSESSMENT. SHE WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT IT'S ONLY ON FULL PREPAYMENTS WITHOUT PENALTY PARTIAL PREPAYMENTS MAY HAVE A PENALTY- WISTFULLY SUPPORT THE ABANDONED REVERSE MORTGAGES WE THINK THAT'S A GOOD FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION- WE ALSO ARE OPPOSED TO THE PAPER COPIES BEING MANDATORY. MANY PEOPLE ARE DOING THIS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS AND TO FORCE US TO KILL A TREE TO PRINT IT OUT AND SEND A FEW FED EX- MAY MITIGATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF PACE SO. WE. SO MANDATORY PHYSICAL COPY. THANK THANK YOU. MEMBERS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. DR APATHY FOR RING IS BILL FORD DIFFICULT QUESTIONS AND CLARIFICATIONS AND IS THAT TRUE IN TERMS OF IF IT IS A MANDATE ON HELPING THE PAPER DOCUMENTS SENT TO YOU THAT THE INDIVIDUAL OR THE CLIENT WOULD BE PRECLUDED FROM HAVING. THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO PAPERLESS. THE ANSWER IS YES SITE I BELIEVE HAVING A HARD COPY IS NECESSARY FOR CONSUMERS TO BE PROTECTED IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THE OPTION TO GO ELECTRONIC. MENTAL WHAT ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE OPTION OF HAVING TO GO PAPERLESS IN ADDITION TO THE OPTION OF GOING TO HAVE A HEART PAPER COPY- FOR THE INDIVIDUAL WITH THEIR BEEN OPPORTUNITY IN THE FUTURE I MEAN I'D GO PAPERLESS FOR MY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS I IMAGINE MOST OF US DO YOU ARE MANY MISTER. HOW THE OPTION OF BOTH NO I DEFINITELY HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND WE'VE CONSIDERED IT IT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE AT A TO YOUR BILL- BUT TO BE FAIR I THINK WE NEED TO PLACE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AT THE FOREFRONT TO DO TOO MUCH OF THE FRAUD THAT WE'VE SEEN AND BELIEVES THAT THE HARD COPY BETTER ALLOWS US TO INSURE THAT. BEYOND THE PERSON SEEKING THE LAWN FAMILY MEMBERS AND INFORMATION AND PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO IT. IF I MAY. UM IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING- IF FIVE AND AM WRONG PLEASE CORRECT ME. THE D. V. O. CURRENTLY REGULATES. THIS TYPE OF POLICY. IS IT NECESSARY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE A MANDATE. ON THIS SPECIFIC POLICY- NOW IF THE TPO IS REGULATING IT AS A STANCE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE REGULATIONS WILL BE FROM THE DPO AND- OR NOR WHEN THOSE REGULATIONS WILL BE PROMULGATED. COMMON IN FAIRNESS- THIS DISCUSSION HAS GONE ON FOR LONGER THAN A YEAR WHILE. THERE ARE STILL CONSUMERS WHO ARENOT BEING PROTECTED BY THE PROTECTIONS WITHIN THE SPELL. AND I WOULD ASK THIS COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION BY PASSING THIS BILL SO WE CAN. CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD- THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSES- I'M GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL- TODAY- MY BIGGEST CONCERNS IS ONE OF COURSE- THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CLIENTS TO GO PAPERLESS AND IS MY SINCERE HOPE THAT. WILL KEEP AN OPEN MIND AS THIS BILL MOVES TOWARD. TOWARD THE OTHER COMMITTEES BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR- ADVOCACY OF PROTECTING A CONSUMER PROTECTION. LISTEN pCHAIR MISTER RANDALL WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD TODAY- LORD THIS YOU BROUGHT UP A WONDERFUL POINT TO I THINK THERE'S BEEN MISSING IN THIS CONVERSATION ALONG THE WAY AND IS THAT IS THAT THERE ARE THEIR COMMUNITIES LOWER ECONOMIC COMMUNITIES WHO ARE BEING HURT BY THIS YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE ISN'T A MONTH THAT GOES BY THAT I DO NOT GET AN EMAIL ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM AND I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL IN MY CITY. THAT ONE OF THE CAPSULES OF GOVERNMENT CAME FORWARD PRESENT THIS PACE PERMIT SO FALLEN LOOK AT ALL THE GREAT THINGS IT'S GOING TO DO AND THAT SAYING CAME TO MIND THAT IF SOMETHING SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE IT PROBABLY IS AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS IT'S MARK I DIDN'T VOTE FOR IT I WAS ON CITY COUNCIL BECAUSE I YOU KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING IN YOUR GUT THAT SAYS. DOESN'T SEEM AN EYE AS RIGHT AND WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T SELL THEIR HOMES WE PEOPLE WHO ARE STUCK IN THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND IT'S A SHAME AND PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO O. THE REQUIREMENT THEY GET IT IN A PAPER FORM. I DON'T THINK THAT'S THAT BIG OF A DEAL ON. TREES A RENEWABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY ANYWAY SO YOU KNOW YOU COME ON DOWN YOU GROW ANOTHER ONE- I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE THE RECORDS. I THINK IT'S- DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE IF IT'S THREE YEARS LATER TO GO BACK AND TRY TO FIND YOUR EMAIL. NOT TOO EASY PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE IN SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WHERE THERE'S A LANGUAGE BARRIER SO. YOU KNOW WHAT KEEP A COPY. ON FILE BUT- EAT YOU I THINK THE REALTOR SAID YOU DON'T HATE THIS PROGRAM IDEAL. SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MEMBERS. AS A MEMBER TRIED. OR SO I WHEN I HAD MY OWN COMMENTS- NAY APPRECIATE- ASSEMBLYMAN FROM LA COMING UP WITH THIS OF NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT ALL CONSUMERS SO I KNOW. AND MYSELF WERE DISSIPATES HAS BEEN UP FOR A LONG TIME- HAS BEEN THE CONTROVERSIAL AND DOES SOME ME I'M PRESENTING THAT ISSUES. AND THAT THESE ARE THE WAYS OF TO PROTECT. THE CONSUMERS WHO ARE MORE VULNERABLE IN THE LOWER ECONOMIC ASH ABOUT AND- ORIGINALLY I HAD THAT SAME QUESTION WHY MANDATING PRINTED COPY IN A THAT WAS MY QUESTION BUT THAT NOW LISTENING TO YOU IT IS SO OFFICER. IT SHOULD BE. AND ELECTRONIC COPY AND THE PRINTED COPY AND THAT THEY CAN HAVE A BOTH COPIES TO IN THE AREA THIS IS SO I THINK ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE IS SOMEONE THING- BUT THE CONSUMER PROTECTION IS SO I THINK IT THIS IS ALL MORE. OVERWHELMING. VERY BENEFICIAL FOR THE CONSUMERS TO SO WITH THAT THE I APPRECIATE AND LOOK AT MY BOOK THANK. I DON'T SEE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS- I- I WANT TO START OFF BY ASKING A FEW ACCEPTS THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. GRAHAM THANK YOU AND- I DO HAVE A SUPPORT RECOMMENDATION ON THIS BILL I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AT SINCE LAST SPRING AS TO YOU KNOW KIND OF ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES I HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TALKING WITH THE OPPOSITION I THINK THAT THE QUESTIONS RAISED IN TERMS OF WHETHER THERE'S ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR AN OPT OUT- FOR THOSE WHO JUST. FILE EVERYTHING ELECTRONICALLY AS OPPOSED TO IN PAPER I THINK THAT'S REAL AS WELL- I ALSO HOPE. THAT TO. THIS BILL MAINTAINS ITS NARROW THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN SEEN A NUMBER OF PEACE BILLS ON THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN BILL WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY SIGNIFICANT THE ONE THAT'S BEEN REFERENCE THAT YOU REFERENCE THAT. D. B. O. IS WORKING ON REGULATIONS- ON THE ON- WORKING A REGULATIONS SUBJECT TO- THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN BILL AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS BILL MAINTAIN ITS NARROW FOCUS AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS- AND IF FOR ANY REASON THE SCOPE IS BROADER. I DO WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I WOULD BRING THIS BILL BACK INTO THIS COMMITTEE- ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT PACE OVERALL. IS CERTAINLY THAT THERE'S SOME ELEMENTS BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION THIS COMMITTEE- OF FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS. THERE ARE SOME ELEMENTS THAT- I A THINKER VERY REAL TO THIS ONE THAT WE DON'T HAVE AN ANNUAL REPORT AND WE DON'T HAVE AN ANNUAL REPORT LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS SO MUCH OF THIS IS COMING TO US AND ANECDOTES- AND IN THAT SPIRIT- WE ALSO HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DECIPHER WHAT'S- THE LEGACY VERSION OF PACE. VERSES THAN YOU REFORMED VERSION OF PACE PACE FROM FOUR YEARS AGO IS NOT PACE FROM TO DAY THESE ARE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THERE'S NEW REGULATIONS THERE- DB O. IS IN THE PROCESS IN OUR CONVERSATION. I'M IN THE PROCESS OF THE- FINALIZE THE REX ANYTHING IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE THAT IN THE DISCUSS AND- I'M AND I'M SUPPORTING THE- I THINK. WE CAN DO. SOMETHING I'M- FOR ALL THINK BECAUSE THE INTENT. WERE MEANT TO TRY TO FIND WAYS FOR HOMEOWNERS. TO MOVE INTO RENEWABLE SPACE THAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE THE FUTURE OF THIS PROGRAM BE ABOUT ELIMINATING THAT OPPORTUNITY- SO I HOPE THAT- FOR ANY KIND OF BROADER CONVERSATIONS OUT THERE THAT SOME OF THESE YOU KNOW CONSIDERATIONS- ARE ARE PART OF THE CONVERSATIONS- BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT THAT WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME AS I SEE THIS PROGRAM CONTINUE- I AM EXCITED THAT THIS IS THE FIRST BILL WE'RE ADDRESSING A- NUMBER OF COLLEAGUES TALK ABOUT. YOUR PROTECT THE DISCLOSURES WHICH I KNOW WE WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT AND SO I HOPE THAT I HEAR THAT SEEM TO THE AZAM- IS BILLS COME FORWARD ON THIS YEAR BECAUSE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND DISCLOSURES ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO KIND OF OPENING AT THE LEGISLATIVE YEAR WITH- A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND DISCLOSURE SO THANK YOU.

THERE WAS. YEAH YEAH YEAH. BECAUSE. THANK IS A MEMBER GRAYSON WILL START WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR IN THEM- IT'S A HONORED TO CONTINUE MAKING YOU HAPPY TALKING ABOUT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND DISCLOSURE. HAVING SAID THAT- THIS AFTERNOON I BRING FORWARD AB SIX NINETY NINE RELATED TO CREDIT SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS AS YOU MAY KNOW THESE ORGANIZATIONS OFFER TO REPAIR A CONSUMER'S CREDIT FILE IN EXCHANGE FOR PAYMENT. TYPICAL SERVICES INCLUDE SCORE ANALYSIS BUREAU CHALLENGES AND CREDITOR INTERVENTIONS HOWEVER THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE THE SERVICES LACK CLEAR DISCLOSURES OF WHAT SPECIFIC SERVICES A CONSUMER IS PURCHASING. AND EQUALLY IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES ON WHAT A CSO HAS ACTUALLY DONE ON BEHALF OF THE CLIENT CONSUMERS ARE LED TO BELIEVE THAT BY SIMPLY HIRING THE CS SO THEY WILL BURKE THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CLEAN UP. THEIR CREDIT FILE AND IMPROVE THEIR FINANCIAL STANDING HOWEVER THIS IGNORES THE FACT THAT NOBODY CAN ERASE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF LEGITIMATE UNPAID BILLS WERE BILLS DEBTS FOR BANKRUPTCY. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS BILL WE HAVE SEEN NUMEROUS MEDIA STORIES ABOUT THE COMMON PRACTICES OF THIS INDUSTRY AND THE CONSUMER PROTECTION FINANCE BUREAU HAS FILED. SUIT AGAINST TWO OF THE LARGEST CREDIT REPAIR BRANDS THE C. BECAUSE- THE CFPB HAS ALSO IN. ISSUED AN ADVICE. ABOUT THE ENEMA CONSUME ABOUT HOW TO AVOID QUOTE UNQUOTE CREATIVE MARKETING TACTICS TO BE CLEAR THE AIR THIS BILL IS NOT TO SHUT DOWN CREDIT REPAIR AND I'LL REPEAT THAT IT'S NOT TO SHUT DOWN CREDIT REPAIR. BUT CLEARLY INACCURATE INFORMATION CAN GET TO A CONSUMERS THAT. SIR CREDIT FILE OR OR- THEIR HISTORY AND NAVIGATE ACCESS. TO THAT INFORMATION CAN RESTAURANT IN AND I'M GOING. FOR THE BILL BEFORE. REALLY TAYLOR ENSURING THE CONTENT CONSUMERS HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE INFORMATION TO KNOW WHAT SERVICES THEY ARE PURCHASING AND WHAT ACTIONS A REPAIR ORGANIZATION IS TAKING ON THEIR BEHALF AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS BILL DOES HAVE SOME OPPOSITION FROM THE CREDIT REPAIR INDUSTRY AND I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE HAD SOME VERY GOOD AND PRODUCTIVE MEETINGS AND I THINK THAT WE'RE HEADED DOWN THE RIGHT TRACK I WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL PARTIES AS THIS BILL WOULD- MOVED TO THE SAYS IF IT IS- ABLE TO. OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY I ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN AN ARGUMENT THAT HAS BEEN RAISED THAT THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT ENABLING DEBT COLLECTORS TO AVOID HAVING TO RESPOND TO LETTERS BY A SEAT SO THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT MINE AND ON PAGE SIX NOW ASSIST IT CLEARLY POINTS OUT THE CUSTOMER BENEFITS THAT THE- BILL WILL HAVE. OR BRING. BENEFITS SO HAVING SAID THAT ALSO SEE SUPPORT FROM A NUMBER OF OTHER DATA FURNITURE'S WHO ARE IMPACTED BY INEFFICIENT AND MISLEADING COMMUNICATION THAT BEING SAID I AM VERY COGNIZANT ABOUT NOT CREATING UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND AT THIS BILL I HAVE RICHARD ALL STAKEHOLDERS THAT I AM COMMITTED TO ENSURING THERE IS NO BOOM POLE I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS WILL LIKELY REQUIRE AMENDMENTS TO GRAPHS IN ENVY OF SECTION THREE OF THIS BILL. AND WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO MR CLICK BERG TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU- CLIFF BURKE HERE IN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS- URGING YOUR SUPPORT OF AB SIX NINE NINE. WE BELIEVE AB SIX NINE NINE IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AND THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS COMMUNITY. FROM UNSCRUPULOUS PRACTICES OF CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATIONS. UNFORTUNATELY CERTAIN PRACTICES THE CREDIT REPAIR INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN PROBLEMATIC FOR A LONG TIME IN CALIFORNIA. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED THE CREDIT SERVICES ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. THE LEGISLATURE FOUNDED DECLARED IN ITS FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS QUOTE UNQUOTE CERTAIN ADVERTISING AND BUSINESS PRACTICES OF SOME CREDIT SERVICES ORGANIZATION. HAVE WORK FINANCIAL HARDSHIP UPON THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE THE PURPOSES OF THIS TITLE ARE TO PROVIDE PROSPECTIVE BUYERS IT SERVICES. OF CREDIT SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS WITH THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO MAKE INTELLIGENT DECISIONS REGARDING THE PURCHASE OF THE SERVICES ENTER. THE PUBLIC UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING AND BUSINESSPRACTICE. UNFORTUNATELY TODAY PROBLEMS WITH CREDIT REPAIR INDUSTRY MAIN FRONT PAGE NEWS. THOUSAND AND NOT KEEN. AS UP. I MEAN BURKE SIMPLE TO THE OUT THE GOOD FINANCE PROTECTION BUREAU KEEPS COMPANIES OF THE LATE IN THE FEDERAL LAW. LOOKING ILL IS DECEPTIVE PRACTICES IN CHARGING CONSUMERS WITHOUT DELIVERING RESULTS. NINE PROVIDE FIRST YOUR UP NEXT CAL STATE PROTECTION SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AB SIX NINE NINE REQUIRES CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH INFORMATION ON SERVICES FORM BEFORE CHARGING THE CONSUMER REASONABLE TIMELINESS TO PREVENT ENDLESS CHARGES FULLER DISCLOSURE OF CONTRACT TERMS BEFORE CONTRACTORS EXECUTED IN A LISTING A REGISTERED CONSUMER REPORT REPAIR ORGANIZATIONS ON. THE WEB. IMPORTANTLY. FOR CREDIBILITY OF THE PROCESS A. B. SIX NINE NINE REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF THE REAL SENDER OF THE COMMUNICATION THIS WILL PREVENT CIRCUMVENTION OF THE ACT AND PROTECT CONSUMERS PRIVACY AND KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IS BEING DONE IN THEIR NAME OFTEN TODAY WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE OR AUTHORIZATION AT THE END OF THE DAY AB SIX NINE PROTECT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES PRACTICES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS RECOGNIZED AS TROUBLESOME FOR MORE THAN FOUR DECADES. OR LONGER. WELL THE GOOD NEWS THAT THE C. F. B. IN THE F. T. C. YOU'RE TAKING ACTION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT LEAVE PROTECTION. FROM THESE PRACTICES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF AB SIX NINE NINE WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE AUTHOR YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF AND OTHER COMMITTEE. STAFF AND OTHERS TO AMEND THE BILL TO ENSURE THAT AB SIX NINE NINE IS FAIR AND REASONABLE TO ALL LEGITIMATE COULD REPAIR ORGANIZATIONS. AND NOT UNDULY BURDENSOME. I HAVE WITH ME. CINDY OCWEN WHO IS THE LEGISLATIVE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS. THE MADAM CHAIR AND FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS- AS CLIFF INVENTION OF CURRENTLY SERVING FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION IS AS THE LEGISLATIVE CHAIR I AM ALSO A SECOND GENERATION IT COLLECTION AGENCY OWNER WITH AN OFFICE HERE IN SACRAMENTO AB SIX NINE NINE IS SPONSORED BY THE FORTY INSTITUTIONAL COLLECTORS AS A DIRECT RESULT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY OUR MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF SHIN AGENCIES NATIONWIDE. EACH DAY ELECTION SEES RISK MAP GEN LETTERS FROM THE SPARROWS ON BEHALF OF CONSUMERS DISPUTING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES FIRST STOP ACCOUNTS. HUNDREDS AND SOME TIMES INST IN SOME INSTANCES THOUSANDS MAYBE RECEIVED BY OUR MEMBERS. EACH LETTER APPEARS IN THE SAME FORMAT TYPESET AND REQUEST VALIDATION AND DOCUMENTATION FOR THE REPORTED ACCOUNT AND OR DELETION FROM A CONSUMER'S CREDIT FILE. ALL THE LETTERS CAN TAKE A WET OR ORIGINAL SIGNATURE OF THE CONSUMERS NAME THE DISPUTE ARE PROCESSED BY OUR MEMBERS AND VALIDATION IS MAILED. AS THE CONSUMER REQUESTED. CONSISTENTLY OUR MEMBERS HAVE REPORTED THAT CONSUMERS DID NOT ACTUALLY DISPUTE THE IS AMOUNT ASSIGNED. THEY'VE INDICATED THE SIGNATURE AND THE LETTER IS NOT THEIR SIGNATURE. THEY'VE EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION AND ANGER AS THEIR CREDIT SCORE DID NOT INCREASE AS THE C. R. O. HAD REPRESENTED THEY PAID FOR SERVICES TO IS ZERO R. C. R. O. WITH NO RESULTS. MULTIPLE LETTERS ARE MAILED COST HIM FOR ACCOUNTS PREVIOUSLY VALIDATED AND AT TIMES THEY ARE UNAWARE THAT ACCOUNTS FOR BEING SENT ON PAID ACCOUNTS. ON BEHALF OF CONSUMERS AB SIX NINE NINE IS INTRODUCED BY ASSEMBLYMAN TIM GRAYSON AND SPONSORED BY C. A. C. TO REVISE THE EXISTING NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR ACT. INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES TO CONSUMERS FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIS HERO'S WRIST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. PLEASE COME FORWARD. THIS IS THE FIRST. THANK YOU. SEEN NONE I SEE NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS- JIM GROSS ON BEHALF OF LEXINGTON LAW I HAVE WITH ME OUR CAMERAS WHO IS COUNSEL- TO LEXINGTON LAW- WE ARE- A CREDIT SERVICES ORGANIZATION- WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS LEGISLATION FIRST LET ME THANK- MISTER GRAYSON. WE DID SPEND A VERY PRODUCTIVE OUR IN HIS OFFICE DISCUSSING THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL AND THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SAW A WITH THAT ARE AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK. THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT BECAUSE I THINK THAT HE DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB ON THE LAST PAGE OF THE BILL THE LAST PAGE OF THE ANALYSIS POINTING OUT WHICH PROVISIONS BILL. BENEFIT SIMMERS AND PROVISIONS OF THE BILL BENEFIT DEBT COLLECTORS. IT IS SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL IN MIKE'S. TO HAVE. AN ENTITY SPONSORING A BILL THAT IN FACT. HAS AN INTEREST IN SEEING THE ENTITIES THAT ARE THE TARGET OF THE BILL BE UNSUCCESSFUL. BECAUSE OF COURSE CREDIT REPORTING. EDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATIONS ARE TRYING TO- LEMONADE THE ITEMS THAT ARE NO LONGER DEBTS ECCENTRIC CENTER. BUT I DON'T WANT TO DEVOLVE INTO A DISCUSSION OF WHICH PARTY HAS DIRTY YOUR HANDS HERE I THINK WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IS TO FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT. CONSUMERS. THAT FROM THIS SERVICE AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS LEGISLATION. PROVIDE CLARITY TO THE CONSUMER ABOUT WHAT SERVICES ARE GETTING HOW THEY'RE GETTING THEM AND WHEN THOSE SERVICES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AND KEEPING THEM UP TO DATE ON THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE CREDIT SERVICE ORGANIZATION IS DOING IT. BUT IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE AND WE'VE HAD THESE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR TO FOCUS MORE ON ISSUES THAT CLEARLY ARE DESIGNED TO E. ROAD THE ABILITY OF CREDIT SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS TO DO WHICH THEIR JOB AND IT WAS A PROVISION THAT MISTER BERG MENTIONED. WHICH IS TO. NOT I TO COMMUNICATION TO A DEBT COLLECTOR THAT IMPLIES THAT IN FACT IT IS BEING DONE ARE DIRECTLY BY THE CONSUMER RAN OUT RATHER THAN ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER AS THE DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE GONE ON WITH THE CAN CONSULT AND WITH. THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE CAN. THAT IS A CREATURE OF FEDERAL LAW FEDERAL LAW SPECIFICALLY A LOUSE CREDIT OR ARE DEBT COLLECTORS. TO PUT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PILE. ANY COMMUNICATION THEY RECEIVE. DIRECTLY FROM A CAN CONSUMER SERVICES ORGANIZATION AS OPPOSED TO FROM THE CONSUMER WHICH MEANS IN THAT INSTANCE. THAT BY PUTTING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PILE. IT'S INCLUDED LEVEL BE RESPONDED TO SO BECAUSE OF THAT PROVISION FEDERAL LAW THE COMMUNICATION IS DONE IN SUCH A WAY. TO ENSURE THAT IT IS OPENED BY THE DEBT COLLECTOR AND RESPONDED TO. BY THE DEBT COLLECTOR WE ARE NOT AS THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL AND WE TALKED REYES AND BODY UNDERSTAND VERY WELL IMPERSONATE. THE CUSTOMER. WE HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE CUSTOMER THE CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS. WHY WERE COMMUNICATING AND UNDERSTANDS THAT WE NEED TO DO SO IN A FASHION INSURERS AN ADEQUATE RESPONSE. AND SO THAT IS PROBABLY OUR BIGGEST OBJECTION- I UNDERSTAND THAT MISTER GRAYSON HAS NOT COMMITTED TO AN AMENDMENT ON IT HE WANTS TO GET IT RIGHT AND WE WANT HIM TO GET IT RIGHT. SO WE OPPOSE THIS BILL AS IT IS. AND BELIEVE THAT. I THINK BY FIVE TO THREE MARGIN IN THE NUMBER OF ITEMS THAT ARE- IDENTIFIED BY THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT. THAT ARE THERE ARE THREE GENERAL STATEMENTS HE MAKES ABOUT WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS WE ARE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN WORKING ON THOSE. THE FIVE THERE IN THE BEST. INTEREST OF THE DEBT COLLECTOR NOT SO MUCH BUT WE WILL CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS WELL IF THIS BILL WERE TO MOVE FORWARD. NOW I. MY CLIENT CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS WERE PROVIDE JAPAN IT'S ON HOW OUR BUSINESS WORKS BUT BUT BECAUSE PERHAPS THAT WILL. BE A BIT ENLIGHTENING TO THE MEMBERS. WELL SENSITIVE TO THE PEOPLE BEHIND ME AND. RIGHT AND I HAVE A LOT IN THIS ONE FOR AWHILE. AGAIN MIKE MY APOLOGIES THROW SOMETHING THAT MAY I NEVER COME A MISSING SOMETHING. ALL RIGHT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE SPACE THAT WE WORK IN- BECAUSE UNLESS SOMEONE HAS HAD THE UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE OF DEALING WITH CREDIT REPORTING ISSUES IT'S OFTEN AN AREA THAT MANY OF US ARE BLIND TO. PEOPLE WHO AND TO COME TO US. ON AVERAGE IF WE WERE JUST TO PICK OUT THE TYPICAL PERSON THEY WOULD HAVE. PROBABLY TEN TRADE LINES ON EACH OF THEIR THREE CREDIT REPORTS THAT MEANS THEY'RE DEALING WITH- AS MANY AS THIRTY ITEMS ON THEIR CREDIT REPORTS THEY ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT THEY MEAN WHAT THEIR IMPACT IS AND WHAT OPTIONS THEY HAVE WITH RESPECT TO THOSE ITEMS. UNFORTUNATELY EVEN THE SAME TRADE LINE DOES NOT ALWAYS APPEAR WITH THE SAME NAME- IT'S OFTEN TRUE THAT BALANCES DO NOT LINE UP BETWEEN THE THREE CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES BECAUSE- OF TIMING DIFFERENCES. AND SO PEOPLE WHO COME TO US. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT COME TO US WITH QUESTIONS. AND THEY ARE IN A LOOK THEY ARE LOOKING TO US TO PROVIDE THEM SOME EXPERIENCE SOME PROFESSIONAL HELP SOME GUIDANCE AND HELP THEM UNDERSTAND OPTIONS. THAT COMES IN TWO FORMS ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE ITEMS THAT SPECIFICALLY APPEAR ON THE CREDIT REPORT WHAT IMPACT THEY MIGHT HAVE UNDERSTANDING THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY HAVE LED TO- THOSE CREDIT REPORTING ITEMS AND OFTEN PEOPLE. DO NOT NECESSARILY RECOGNIZE ITEMS ON THEIR CREDIT REPORT THAT'S. OFTEN MORE TRUE IN THE CASE OF COLLECTIONS BECAUSE- CONSUMERS DON'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR DEBT COLLECTOR IT'S AT THEIR NOT CHOOSING TO GO- TO A PARTICULAR ENTITY AND SO- IT MAY NOT BE RECOGNIZABLE- IT ALSO CAN BE A LITTLE DIFFICULT FOR THEM BECAUSE- DEBT TENDS TO MOVE FROM ONE COLLECTOR TO ANOTHER AND SO THE SAME DEBT- ME. GO THROUGH A NUMBER OF COLLECTORS AND A NUMBER OF COLLECTION PROCESSES AGAIN THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS IT MEANS THAT THE CONSUMER MAY NOT RECOGNIZE. ITEMS ON THEIR CREDIT REPORT AND NEED HELP IN INVESTIGATING UNDERSTANDING THE BASIS FOR THEIR CREDIT REPORTING- THEY MAY NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHTS- THEIR SPECIAL PROTECTIONS FOR A MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY- WE SEE PEOPLE WHO GO THROUGH DIVORCE CIRCUMSTANCES THOSE ARE OFTEN VERY COMPLICATED CREDIT REPORTING CIRCUMSTANCES- WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT STUDENT LENDING- SOMETHING THAT'S IN THE- MEDIA CURRENTLY. PEOPLE FREQUENTLY HAVE A CONCERNS ABOUT MEDICAL DEBT AND WHY IT APPEARS ON THEIR CREDIT REPORT AND THEY MAY BE BATTLING IT OUT WITH AN INSURER- AND SO ALL OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES LEAD TO US. AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS ON THEIR BEHALF AND PRIMARILY THAT'S WHAT WE DO WERE ASKING QUESTIONS ON THEIR BEHALF WHY IT IS ON THE CREDIT REPORT. WHAT IS THE BASIS FOR IT TO APPEAR- BECAUSE THAT UNDERSTANDING IS CRITICAL TO THEM BEING ABLE TO TAKE ACTION. THE OTHER PIECES IN AND ASK YOU TO WRAP IT UP THANK YOU. ONE OF THE KEYS IS NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT POSITIVE STEPS WHAT CAN THEY DO TO PUT POSITIVE HISTORY DOWN AND SO WE WORK WITH THEM ON BOTH OF THOSE PIECES PIECES DEALING WITH THE HISTORY. AND WHAT CAN THEY DO GOING FORWARD THAT'S BETTER. THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEEN NINE MEMBERS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. AS A MATTER OF OUR CAN. WELL I WOULD I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL I THINK ITS NAME SEEMS LIKE AN IMPORTANT ADDED CONSUMER PROTECTION IN AN AREA WHERE WE ALWAYS NEED MORE SAID THANK YOU AND THERE'S SOME REALLY STRONG AND GOOD CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN THE BILL I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE IS THERE SEEM TO BE SOME. IF YOU SAID WITH THE OPPOSITION SAID ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. AND I ALSO READ THE PRIVACY AND PRIVACY SO I READ THAT. ANALYSIS AS WELL SO I MAY BE CONFUSING THE TWO BUT- MY- UNDERSTANDING IS THAT AND ENVY WILL BE. ENDED SO THAT IT WILL NOT PASS THE LEGISLATURE AND LESS THEY ARE REQUIRED TO RESPOND TO THE LETTERS THAT COME FROM THE CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES AND YOU BIG. COMMITMENT IS THAT RIGHT. THERE IS LANGUAGE ORDERED THERE HAVE BEEN CONVERSATIONS ON TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO LOOPHOLE THAT. RESPONSE WILL BE REQUIRED OKAY TO- REQUESTER. OKAY THANK YOU. I'M AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION. FOR THE OPPOSITION IS WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF TIME IT. TAKES TO PERFORM ONE OF THESE. FUNDS THIS IS AS I'M TRYING TO SENSE THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY YES. I FROM AN AVERAGE STANDPOINT. TEND TO SEE PEOPLE. SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS- THERE OBVIOUSLY EXCEPTIONS TO THAT PEOPLE WHO STAY LONGER- PEOPLE WHO STAY FOR LESS PERIOD OF TIME. TYPICALLY WE'RE SEEING PEOPLE SIX TO SEVEN MONTHS. OKAY SO THAT'S A HUNDRED EIGHT IS A SIX MONTHS. SO I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THAT I DON'T WANT I MEAN. HAVING SPOKEN TO PEOPLE WHO'VE TRIED TO DO THIS THEMSELVES THAT HAS TAKEN THEM YEARS. TO FIX THEIR CREDIT RATING SO I DON'T WANT US TO BE PUTTING YOU INTO A CORNER YOU CAN'T. CONTRACT FOR SERVICES AND NOT COMPLETE THEM IN THE SPECIFIED AMOUNT OF TIME AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'VE LEFT AMOUNT OF TIME FOR CONSUMERS TO CONTRACT AND COMPLETE. AND THE THING IS SOME OF THAT SEEMS TO BE OUT OF YOUR CONTROL I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WERE YOU. HAVE THE SERVICE. IT'S WHAT. THE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND- A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS. MANY OTHER STATES HAVE ALREADY OF PUT IN STATUTE OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AND THEN ALSO IT DOESN'T SAY HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AND THEN THE RELATIONSHIP IS ACTUALLY OVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS IS WHEN THAT PARTICULAR CONTRACT MAY BE OVER BUT THE SERVICE PROVIDER CAN THEN TURN RIGHT AROUND AND EXTEND IT WITH AN ADDITIONAL CONTACT OR RE ENTER INTO A CONTRACT SO IT JUST SIMPLY BE A- POINT. OF REFERENCE FOR- BOTH THE CLIENT WITH CONSUMER AND THE PROVIDER TO BE A COME BACK TOGETHER READ OR REDO THE TERM OR LOOK AT TERMS AGAINST SIGNED A NEW CONTRACT AND TO THE SERVICES THAT WERE ALREADY PROVIDED THE PREVIOUS CONTRACT THEY CAN TEN YOU INTO AN ADDITIONAL CONTACT. THE TIME IS NEEDED TO CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY RIDE SERVICES. AS MUCH AS ALREADY IN THE EXISTING STATUTE. OKAY A LOT ALREADY BROUGHT IT OKAY THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHOI. ONE OF THE PRESIDENCY ARE IS THAT THE AG ATTORNEY GENERAL IS ALLOWED TO. INCREASE CSOS SO. ANNUAL FEE TO ANY AMOUNT CURRENTLY HANYA DAUGHTERS SO THAT MEANS. WHEN THE FEES COOPER- IT'LL EVENTUALLY HURT THE CONSUMERS IT BECAUSE SO THEY WOULD JUST OF PASS IT DOWN TO CONSUMERS. THIS YES- SO WHY DO YOU WANNA. LEAVE IT OPEN RATHER THAN HAVING A CAP. I BELIEVE IT'S TIED TO COST RECOVERY. AB AND WITH THAT ONGOING DISCUSSIONS ARE ARE IN PROGRESS WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AS WELL SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS IN THAT ON THAT SUBJECT. IT THAT THAT'S A CONTRACT TO RENEW OUR FEES SO LET ME TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS THE WAR. IS A SAID JUSTO REGISTRATION FEE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. I'VE BEEN A FEES THAT. I RETURN TO. THE REGISTRATION FEE FOR REGISTERING CURRENT LAW REQUIRES ALL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NEED TO REGISTER WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT YEAH YES LAW BOB THIS BILL CONTEMPLATES A BIT MORE OVERSIGHT INCLUDING A PUBLICATION ON THEIR WEBSITE OF THE DEPARTMENT JUST AS WEBSITE OF A LIST OF REGISTERED COMPANY SO CONSUMERS ARE AWARE OF. WHO IS A LEGITIMATE COMPANY WHO IS REGISTERED ON THE WEBSITE SO THAT PROVISION WAS ADDED TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO RECOVER THEIR COSTS BUT WE HAVE TALKED WITH. THE M. A. N. E. L. IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO REFINE IT TOO WITH A CAP AT SOME POINT- I THINK THAT'S AN- ISSUE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THERE'S NO INTENT. THERE IS NO INTENT THERE THAT THE FEE WOULD BE. LAW A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON A COMPANY REMEMBER IT'S A PER COMPANY FEE AND EACH ONE OF THOSE COMPANIES MAY BE SERVICING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF CONSUMERS. THE NOTION OF IT ONE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS THAT WOULD BE AN INCREASE COSTS FOR ANYBODY REALLY I THINK IS A MINIMAL WORE. MINIMAL WORRIED BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF. CLIENTS BEING SERVICE IN THE FACT THAT IT'S PER COMPANY PER FEE BUT- THAT WAS THE INTENT WAS JUST TO ENSURE THE DOJ RECOVERS THEIR COSTS. I'M SETTING UP THE WEBSITE INFORMATION YEAH I THINK IF YOU TALK ABOUT SPREADING OUT THE COST OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR REGISTRATION FEE AMONGST ALL THE CLIENTS IT'S- MINIMAL TO YES THE FRACTION OF A PENNY YEAH OR DOES HE IS. THIS YEAR'S OWNS SO REGISTRATION FEE ANNUAL FEE THAT'S WHAT IT IS ABOUT THE. EIJI CAN INCREASE TO ANY AMOUNT THE- RIGHT NOW I'M SURE HUNDRED DOLLARS IS THE WORKING THAT'S THE REASON HUNDRED DOLLARS ABOUT THE- FULL. WHATEVER UNKNOWN REASON IF THE DOUBLE THE FEET TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY HURT THE CONSUMERS TO. SAY THAT'S WHY. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WANNA LEAVE IT OPEN TO. WITH A NOR LIMITATION I HEAR YOUR CONCERN AND SO WE WILL DEFINITELY CARRY THAT IF THIS BILL WAS TO GET OUT HERE UNDER THAT INTO A CONVERSATION MISSION. THANK YOU. ANGEL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.
