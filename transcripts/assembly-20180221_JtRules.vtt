.

00:33:03.215 --> 00:33:06.718 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS PROJECT REPRESENTS

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:07.652 region:rollup2
AN OPTION FOR US TO DO THREE

00:33:06.718 --> 00:33:09.387 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT THING FOR THE

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:10.722 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:33:09.387 --> 00:33:12.257 region:rollup2
ONE IS IMPROVING ACCESS TO THE

00:33:10.722 --> 00:33:12.424 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

00:33:12.257 --> 00:33:14.459 region:rollup2
AND.

00:33:12.424 --> 00:33:15.627 region:rollup2
.

00:33:14.459 --> 00:33:16.995 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT THE BUILDING THE

00:33:15.627 --> 00:33:17.762 region:rollup2
ANNEX WAS BUILT IN FIFTY TWO IT

00:33:16.995 --> 00:33:20.031 region:rollup2
DOES NOT HAVE.

00:33:17.762 --> 00:33:21.967 region:rollup2
SPRINKLERS.

00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:24.336 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO DID THE.

00:33:21.967 --> 00:33:26.104 region:rollup2
EIGHTY A ACCESS IS NOT THERE WE

00:33:24.336 --> 00:33:27.706 region:rollup2
WALK AROUND THE BUILDING THOSE

00:33:26.104 --> 00:33:29.975 region:rollup2
OF US WALK PAST THESE LIFTS ALL

00:33:27.706 --> 00:33:31.476 region:rollup2
THE TIME. NOT REALIZING HELP

00:33:29.975 --> 00:33:33.812 region:rollup2
CONTENT KRISTEN GOOD BE HOW

00:33:31.476 --> 00:33:35.814 region:rollup2
BULKY THEY COULD BE. HOW SOMEONE

00:33:33.812 --> 00:33:37.616 region:rollup2
HAS A A MOTORIZED CHAIR WITH

00:33:35.814 --> 00:33:39.551 region:rollup2
ROOM FOR THEIR CRUTCHES IN THE

00:33:37.616 --> 00:33:41.152 region:rollup2
BACK? THAT THAT THAT MAY

00:33:39.551 --> 00:33:42.120 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY NOT FIT THE LIVES WE

00:33:41.152 --> 00:33:43.154 region:rollup2
PROVIDE.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.456 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S MANY WAYS IN WHICH

00:33:43.154 --> 00:33:46.524 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING IS NOT WELCOME AND

00:33:44.456 --> 00:33:47.459 region:rollup2
ALL CALIFORNIANS THE SHEEN ON

00:33:46.524 --> 00:33:47.893 region:rollup2
THE FLOOR DOES NOT ADDRESS

00:33:47.459 --> 00:33:50.495 region:rollup2
PEOPLE VISUAL OCULAR

00:33:47.893 --> 00:33:53.164 region:rollup2
IMPAIRMENTS.

00:33:50.495 --> 00:33:54.933 region:rollup2
AND EVEN THE THE HARD SERVICES

00:33:53.164 --> 00:33:56.534 region:rollup2
THE QUARTERS AFFECTED NOISE

00:33:54.933 --> 00:33:58.603 region:rollup2
LEVEL THE CAN AFFECT PEOPLE WITH

00:33:56.534 --> 00:34:00.238 region:rollup2
HEARING ISSUE SO THERE'S. MANY

00:33:58.603 --> 00:34:01.673 region:rollup2
WAYS WE MIGHT IMPROVE IT.

00:34:00.238 --> 00:34:02.974 region:rollup2
AND THIS ACTUALLY WOULD BE IN

00:34:01.673 --> 00:34:04.175 region:rollup2
KEEPING WITH THE ORIGINAL INTENT

00:34:02.974 --> 00:34:07.178 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIANS.

00:34:04.175 --> 00:34:08.546 region:rollup2
I.

00:34:07.178 --> 00:34:10.015 region:rollup2
I GREATLY ENJOY THE FACT WHEN

00:34:08.546 --> 00:34:11.016 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ON THE WEST WING AND YOU

00:34:10.015 --> 00:34:13.018 region:rollup2
WALK UP AND DOWN THOSE

00:34:11.016 --> 00:34:14.920 region:rollup2
STAIRCASES.

00:34:13.018 --> 00:34:15.720 region:rollup2
DECORATING THE BOTTOMS OF ALL

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.589 region:rollup2
THE NEWEL POST CARVED IN THE

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.457 region:rollup2
WATER PINEAPPLES.

00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:20.625 region:rollup2
WHICH OUR SYMBOL OF HOSPITALITY

00:34:19.457 --> 00:34:21.860 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE EIGHTEEN SIXTIES YOU

00:34:20.625 --> 00:34:23.094 region:rollup2
HAD TO COME TO.

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:25.297 region:rollup2
THE CUT MILIEU ES FROM HAWAII.

00:34:23.094 --> 00:34:27.265 region:rollup2
AND IT'S

00:34:25.297 --> 00:34:27.832 region:rollup2
IT CAUSES ME REFLECTED. WHEN THE

00:34:27.265 --> 00:34:29.534 region:rollup2
BUILDING OPENED IN THE WEST

00:34:27.832 --> 00:34:31.436 region:rollup2
WING.

00:34:29.534 --> 00:34:32.137 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY WHO WENT ANYWHERE IN

00:34:31.436 --> 00:34:33.905 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING USING THOSE

00:34:32.137 --> 00:34:35.473 region:rollup2
STAIRCASES EVERYWHERE THEY TURN

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:38.009 region:rollup2
THEIR SUPPLYING UPPER REMIND

00:34:35.473 --> 00:34:40.245 region:rollup2
THEM. OF THE WELCOMING MESSAGE

00:34:38.009 --> 00:34:41.813 region:rollup2
OF THE. PEOPLE'S HOUSE.

00:34:40.245 --> 00:34:43.281 region:rollup2
IT IS A MARVEL TO ME THAT THE

00:34:41.813 --> 00:34:45.216 region:rollup2
WEST WING WITH SO MANY GREAT

00:34:43.281 --> 00:34:47.419 region:rollup2
SYMBOLS CONCERNING OUR DEMOCRACY

00:34:45.216 --> 00:34:48.954 region:rollup2
AND WELCOMING PEOPLE.

00:34:47.419 --> 00:34:49.888 region:rollup2
SO RICH WAS SYMBOLISM THAT WE

00:34:48.954 --> 00:34:51.790 region:rollup2
COME IN THE ANNEX AND THE

00:34:49.888 --> 00:34:53.258 region:rollup2
SYMBOLS ARE NOT HERE.

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:55.026 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW THERE IS A TOTAL FAIL TO

00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:56.728 region:rollup2
CARRY FOR THIS VISION OF

00:34:55.026 --> 00:34:57.963 region:rollup2
HOSPITALITY AND THE USE OF

00:34:56.728 --> 00:34:59.698 region:rollup2
SYMBOLS TO CONVEY THE MEANING OF

00:34:57.963 --> 00:35:00.565 region:rollup2
OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT.

00:34:59.698 --> 00:35:02.067 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU GIVE THE ADDICTS ARE

00:35:00.565 --> 00:35:04.336 region:rollup2
JUST NOT THERE.

00:35:02.067 --> 00:35:04.836 region:rollup2
ARE. ALSO WILL JUST THE IDEA OF

00:35:04.336 --> 00:35:06.404 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING GREATER CIVIC

00:35:04.836 --> 00:35:06.638 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT

00:35:06.404 --> 00:35:09.307 region:rollup2
I THINK.

00:35:06.638 --> 00:35:10.442 region:rollup2
.

00:35:09.307 --> 00:35:11.242 region:rollup2
WHEN I FIRST STARTED THE

00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:12.444 region:rollup2

00:35:11.242 --> 00:35:14.646 region:rollup2
SEVEN WHAT THE KIDS HAD TO SEE

WAS ACCOUNTING EXHIBITS.

00:35:14.646 --> 00:35:18.450 region:rollup2
THEN MY FIRST BOSS IN CHARGE OF

00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:19.017 region:rollup2
THE WEST WING ADDED THE MUSEUM

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:20.318 region:rollup2

EXHIBITS IS SO MUCH GREATER.

00:35:29.694 --> 00:35:32.430 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK A BUILDING

PROJECTS ALLOWS US TO WEAVE INTO

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:36.101 region:rollup2

PART OF THE BUILDING.

00:39:10.882 --> 00:39:12.851 region:rollup2

OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS SO?

00:39:32.437 --> 00:39:35.540 region:rollup2

00:40:32.664 --> 00:40:35.566 region:rollup2
AND THINK THE PROJECT RIGHT NOW

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:37.068 region:rollup2
IS WE HAVE BEEN.

00:40:35.566 --> 00:40:38.870 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING A LOT OF

00:40:37.068 --> 00:40:39.404 region:rollup2
COURTHOUSES AROUND CALIFORNIA

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:41.272 region:rollup2
IN THE IN THE LAST FIFTEEN

00:40:39.404 --> 00:40:42.674 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:44.042 region:rollup2
AND THAT ACTUALLY HAS A VERY

00:40:42.674 --> 00:40:45.910 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT BENCHMARK BECAUSE WE

00:40:44.042 --> 00:40:47.812 region:rollup2
KNOW COURTHOUSES.

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:49.380 region:rollup2

00:40:47.812 --> 00:40:50.281 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO IN YOUR TECHNOLOGY.

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.917 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE HIGHER THAN AVERAGE

00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:55.286 region:rollup2
FINISHES THEY NEED TO HAVE LARGE

00:40:52.917 --> 00:40:56.254 region:rollup2
SPACES TO ACCOMMODATE JURY PULLS

00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:58.890 region:rollup2
THE ACTUAL COURTROOM FOR SO

00:40:56.254 --> 00:41:00.491 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES SO REQUIRE. A

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:01.392 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TYPE OF ENGINEERING.

00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:01.959 region:rollup2
TO ACCOMMODATE THE TRAFFIC

00:41:01.392 --> 00:41:03.328 region:rollup2
VOLUMES IT MOVED THROUGH THE

00:41:01.959 --> 00:41:04.796 region:rollup2
COURTHOUSES.

00:41:03.328 --> 00:41:06.764 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS

00:41:04.796 --> 00:41:08.333 region:rollup2
FOR US IN THE LEGISLATURE IS AT

00:41:06.764 --> 00:41:09.867 region:rollup2
THIS MOMENT WE'RE CONCERNED WHAT

00:41:08.333 --> 00:41:11.869 region:rollup2
WE MIGHT DO WITH OUR AN EX.

00:41:09.867 --> 00:41:13.571 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF DATA

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:14.739 region:rollup2
CONCERNING VERY SIMILAR

00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:16.040 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS BEING BUILT ALL OVER

00:41:14.739 --> 00:41:17.809 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND THE COSTS

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:20.044 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THEM.

00:41:17.809 --> 00:41:21.746 region:rollup2
SO ITS NOT WERE NOT QUITE FLYING

00:41:20.044 --> 00:41:24.148 region:rollup2
AS BLIND AS YOU MIGHT FEEL. A

00:41:21.746 --> 00:41:25.850 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH IT SAY IT IS A NEW

00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:27.452 region:rollup2

WHERE FIRM OF AROUND A HUNDRED

00:43:11.355 --> 00:43:15.493 region:rollup2
PEOPLE? AND ONE OF OUR EXPERTISE

00:43:13.958 --> 00:43:16.461 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON

00:43:15.493 --> 00:43:18.429 region:rollup2
ARE THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE OR

00:43:16.461 --> 00:43:19.197 region:rollup2
CAPITOL BUILDINGS.

00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:20.131 region:rollup2
THE TEAM THAT WORKED ON THIS

00:43:19.197 --> 00:43:22.066 region:rollup2
PROJECT.

00:43:20.131 --> 00:43:24.068 region:rollup2
FOR THE STUDY HERE HAS WORKED

00:43:22.066 --> 00:43:25.703 region:rollup2
ON NOW THREE CAPITOL BUILDINGS.

00:43:24.068 --> 00:43:26.003 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE UNITED STATES AND

00:43:25.703 --> 00:43:27.805 region:rollup2
THE WESTERN.

00:43:26.003 --> 00:43:30.741 region:rollup2
SECTOR.

00:43:27.805 --> 00:43:32.577 region:rollup2
IN SOME CASES THE PROJECTS WERE

00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:34.011 region:rollup2
GROUND BEGINNING JUST TO WHERE

00:43:32.577 --> 00:43:35.546 region:rollup2
YOU GUYS ARE OUT RIGHT NOW THE

00:43:34.011 --> 00:43:37.215 region:rollup2
MASTER PLANNING PROGRAMMING.

00:43:35.546 --> 00:43:38.783 region:rollup2
ASPECT IN IN SOME CASES WE WERE

00:43:37.215 --> 00:43:39.984 region:rollup2
BROUGHT IN TO HELP RESCUE.

00:43:38.783 --> 00:43:41.652 region:rollup2
PROJECTS WERE HAVING A HARD TIME

00:43:39.984 --> 00:43:42.720 region:rollup2
CONTINUING.

00:43:41.652 --> 00:43:44.255 region:rollup2
IN THIS CASE HERE WERE ONCE

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.057 region:rollup2
AGAIN INVOLVED AT THE BEGINNING

00:43:44.255 --> 00:43:48.192 region:rollup2
OF THE PROCESS WHICH I THINK IS

00:43:46.057 --> 00:43:51.929 region:rollup2
THE MOST. IMPORTANT PART BECAUSE

00:43:48.192 --> 00:43:53.331 region:rollup2
IT'S YOUR FIRST STEP FORWARD.

00:43:51.929 --> 00:43:54.599 region:rollup2
AS WE AS WE LOOK AT THIS WITH

00:43:53.331 --> 00:43:55.766 region:rollup2
THEIR PROJECTS WE'VE ACTUALLY

00:43:54.599 --> 00:43:57.001 region:rollup2
WORKED ON IN THE PAST WE HAVE A

00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:58.669 region:rollup2
FEW THINGS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY

00:43:57.001 --> 00:43:59.937 region:rollup2
OFFER FROM OUR EXPERIENCE THAT

00:43:58.669 --> 00:44:00.838 region:rollup2
WE THINK ARE. IN BE.

00:43:59.937 --> 00:44:02.540 region:rollup2
USEFUL.

00:44:00.838 --> 00:44:04.008 region:rollup2
THROUGH PROCESS BUT WHAT I CAN

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:06.344 region:rollup2
SAY IS THAT THERE'S.

00:44:04.008 --> 00:44:07.812 region:rollup2
MANY MORE ASPECTS TO DESERT

00:44:06.344 --> 00:44:09.447 region:rollup2
DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING AN

00:44:07.812 --> 00:44:11.149 region:rollup2
EXPANSION TO A CAPITOL BUILDING

00:44:09.447 --> 00:44:13.184 region:rollup2
THEN. YOU MIGHT PARTICULARLY NO

00:44:11.149 --> 00:44:14.185 region:rollup2
AT THIS POINT AND TIME.

00:44:13.184 --> 00:44:15.520 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I WOULD

00:44:14.185 --> 00:44:17.054 region:rollup2
SUGGEST IN ONE OF THOSE FIRST

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:18.723 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT I AM IS NOT

00:44:17.054 --> 00:44:20.391 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY ILLUSTRATED IN A

00:44:18.723 --> 00:44:22.026 region:rollup2
COST TO. FOR CONSTRUCTION BUDGET

00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:23.628 region:rollup2
IS

00:44:22.026 --> 00:44:24.328 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC NOTIFICATION AND THE

00:44:23.628 --> 00:44:26.097 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT WORKED IN THE

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:27.632 region:rollup2
BUILDING NOTIFICATION IT'S VERY

00:44:26.097 --> 00:44:29.233 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AS YOU WORK ON THESE

00:44:27.632 --> 00:44:30.801 region:rollup2
PROJECTS THAT YOU CONSIDER.

00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:32.570 region:rollup2
YOUR INFORMATION.

00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:33.638 region:rollup2
PROCESSING PROGRAMS WE NEED TO

00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:35.106 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE PEOPLE

00:44:33.638 --> 00:44:36.407 region:rollup2
THAT ARE COMING TO VISIT YOUR

00:44:35.106 --> 00:44:37.775 region:rollup2
CAPITOL BUILDING. DURING THE

00:44:36.407 --> 00:44:39.343 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION CYCLE AND DURING

00:44:37.775 --> 00:44:41.512 region:rollup2
THE DESIGN CYCLE BECAUSE THEY

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:43.080 region:rollup2
WANT TO SEE IT FOR ONE LAST TIME

00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:43.981 region:rollup2
AS IT CURRENTLY RESIDES.

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:46.117 region:rollup2
I'M YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU

00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:48.152 region:rollup2

MORE PEOPLE THAN YOU EVER

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:53.357 region:rollup2
THOUGHT INTERESTED IN THIS

00:44:50.655 --> 00:44:54.492 region:rollup2
PROJECT AS YOU MOVE FORWARD.

00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:55.760 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE NEXT THINGS I THINK

00:44:54.492 --> 00:44:57.061 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT WE

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.363 region:rollup2
FIND IN EVERY CAPITOL BUILDING

00:44:57.061 --> 00:45:01.065 region:rollup2
WE'VE EVER. WORKED WITH OR BEEN

00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:02.033 region:rollup2
TO IS THAT NONE OF THEM HAVE

00:45:01.065 --> 00:45:03.501 region:rollup2
ENOUGH MEETING SPACE CONFERENCE

00:45:02.033 --> 00:45:05.736 region:rollup2
SPACE.

00:45:03.501 --> 00:45:06.604 region:rollup2
OR APPROPRIATE HEARING SPACES.

00:45:05.736 --> 00:45:08.539 region:rollup2
GENERALLY SPEAKING.

00:45:06.604 --> 00:45:10.508 region:rollup2
MOST PEOPLE HAVE DONE MUCH LIKE

YOU HAVE THEY'VE ADDED SOME INTO

00:45:10.508 --> 00:45:13.010 region:rollup2
THEIR.

00:45:11.075 --> 00:45:14.211 region:rollup2
CAPITOL COMPLEX SPECIFICALLY

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:15.980 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY'VE HAD TO DO SOME

00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:17.315 region:rollup2
REMOTING TO OF THAT. AND A LOT

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:19.083 region:rollup2
OF THEM HAVE ACTUALLY RESORTED

00:45:17.315 --> 00:45:20.484 region:rollup2
TO THE USE OF ELECTRONICS FOR

00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:23.387 region:rollup2
ALMOST.

00:45:20.484 --> 00:45:25.222 region:rollup2
ALL THEIR INCLUSION OF THEIR A

GENERAL POPULATION. YOU HAVE AN

00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:28.926 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY IN THIS BUILDING TO.

00:45:26.857 --> 00:45:30.161 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY GRASP THE SUBJECT

00:45:28.926 --> 00:45:32.029 region:rollup2
AND MOVE IT FORWARD AND NOT

00:45:30.161 --> 00:45:33.397 region:rollup2
ALLOW FOR BETTER HEARING SPACE

00:45:32.029 --> 00:45:36.767 region:rollup2
BETTER MEETING SPACE.

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:39.036 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING.

00:45:36.767 --> 00:45:40.805 region:rollup2
BUT BUILDINGS ARE SYMBOLS OF

00:45:39.036 --> 00:45:42.707 region:rollup2
THIS TYPE ARE SYMBOLS.

00:45:40.805 --> 00:45:43.874 region:rollup2

THE PEOPLE.

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:55.052 region:rollup2
AS WE WORK ON THESE PROJECTS WE

00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:56.954 region:rollup2
HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT

00:45:55.052 --> 00:45:58.489 region:rollup2
THAT ACTUALLY MEANS.

00:45:56.954 --> 00:45:59.824 region:rollup2
AS WE'RE DEVELOPING.

00:45:58.489 --> 00:46:01.859 region:rollup2
DESIGNS AND THOSE WERE

00:45:59.824 --> 00:46:03.794 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING WHY PEOPLE NEED TO

00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:04.395 region:rollup2
BILL AND THE BUILDING AND HOW

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:06.631 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE NEED TO WORK WITHIN

00:46:04.395 --> 00:46:08.032 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING.

00:46:06.631 --> 00:46:10.868 region:rollup2
MOST OF THE TIME WE FIND IS THAT

00:46:08.032 --> 00:46:11.769 region:rollup2
THERE'S CONFLICTS IN SPACE USE.

00:46:10.868 --> 00:46:13.471 region:rollup2
WE'VE TYPICALLY FOUND THAT

00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:15.006 region:rollup2
THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH SPACE FOR

00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:15.640 region:rollup2
ALL THE FUNCTIONAL NEEDS WITHIN

00:46:15.006 --> 00:46:16.540 region:rollup2
A BUILDING IN THIS BUILDING WAS

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.842 region:rollup2
BUILT.

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:19.844 region:rollup2
SIXTY FIVE YEARS AGO FOR A PART

00:46:17.842 --> 00:46:22.680 region:rollup2
TIME LEGISLATURE.

00:46:19.844 --> 00:46:24.248 region:rollup2
IT DOES NOT CURRENTLY HOUSE WHAT

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.916 region:rollup2
FROM OUR VARIOUS CONVERSATIONS

00:46:24.248 --> 00:46:26.417 region:rollup2
WITH THE USERS WITHIN THE

00:46:25.916 --> 00:46:28.152 region:rollup2
BUILDING HOUSE ALL THE.

00:46:26.417 --> 00:46:29.320 region:rollup2
.

00:46:28.152 --> 00:46:30.421 region:rollup2
CAPABILITY THAT.

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:32.757 region:rollup2
IS A DESIRED WITHIN THE

00:46:30.421 --> 00:46:34.825 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

00:46:32.757 --> 00:46:35.826 region:rollup2
ONE THING OF OF NOTE AND I THIS

00:46:34.825 --> 00:46:37.194 region:rollup2
IS PROBABLY SOMETHING YOU'LL

00:46:35.826 --> 00:46:38.796 region:rollup2
HEAR A LOT ABOUT OVER TIME IS

00:46:37.194 --> 00:46:40.965 region:rollup2
THAT THE BUILDING ITSELF.

00:46:38.796 --> 00:46:43.067 region:rollup2
AS EXTRACTED PREDATES.

00:46:40.965 --> 00:46:44.468 region:rollup2
ALL THE MODERN.

00:46:43.067 --> 00:46:46.270 region:rollup2
BUILDING CODES HEALTH SAFETY

00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:48.005 region:rollup2
CODES.

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:48.172 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBILITY COATS.

00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:50.107 region:rollup2
AND.

00:46:48.172 --> 00:46:51.742 region:rollup2
.

00:46:50.107 --> 00:46:55.513 region:rollup2
I CARRY NEEDS OF THE OF THIS

00:46:51.742 --> 00:46:56.781 region:rollup2
PERIOD OF TIME.

00:46:55.513 --> 00:46:58.249 region:rollup2
ALL THE BUILDINGS WE GOING TO

00:46:56.781 --> 00:46:59.750 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY HAVE.

00:46:58.249 --> 00:47:01.619 region:rollup2
AGING MECHANICAL AGING

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:04.922 region:rollup2
ELECTRICAL.

00:47:01.619 --> 00:47:06.691 region:rollup2
AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

00:47:04.922 --> 00:47:08.025 region:rollup2
AS RETROFITTED TECHNOLOGY NONE

00:47:06.691 --> 00:47:09.126 region:rollup2
OF THESE BUILDINGS WERE BUILT

00:47:08.025 --> 00:47:10.494 region:rollup2
WITH THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE GOING

00:47:09.126 --> 00:47:12.663 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY

00:47:10.494 --> 00:47:13.597 region:rollup2
THINK BACK FIFTY YEARS AGO.

00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:16.100 region:rollup2
THERE WEREN'T CELLPHONES THEY

00:47:13.597 --> 00:47:16.634 region:rollup2
WERE IN PREVALENT USE.

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:18.636 region:rollup2
LAPTOPS WERE AVAILABLE FOR

00:47:16.634 --> 00:47:19.937 region:rollup2
PEOPLE. THERE WERE DESKTOPS AND

00:47:18.636 --> 00:47:21.238 region:rollup2
IF YOU DID HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF

00:47:19.937 --> 00:47:23.274 region:rollup2
HAVING SOME SORT OF LOVABLE

00:47:21.238 --> 00:47:23.808 region:rollup2
COMPUTER YOU COULD CARRY AROUND

00:47:23.274 --> 00:47:24.975 region:rollup2
A COMPUTER AT A FOUR INCH

00:47:23.808 --> 00:47:26.677 region:rollup2
SCREEN.

00:47:24.975 --> 00:47:28.012 region:rollup2
TODAY THEY'RE UBIQUITOUS EVERY

00:47:26.677 --> 00:47:29.280 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO THOSE NEED

00:47:28.012 --> 00:47:31.015 region:rollup2
TO BE THOUGHT OUT WHAT WE NEED

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.750 region:rollup2
TO THINK ABOUT IS WHAT IS GOING

00:47:31.015 --> 00:47:33.417 region:rollup2
TO BE LIKE IN FIFTY YEARS AND

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:34.652 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THEY

00:47:33.417 --> 00:47:35.653 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE CAN SUPPORT THAT

00:47:34.652 --> 00:47:37.655 region:rollup2
IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE NOW WE

00:47:35.653 --> 00:47:39.623 region:rollup2
HAVEA BETTER EYE. ON WHERE GOV

00:47:37.655 --> 00:47:41.726 region:rollup2
OUR COUNTRY IS GOING AND AREN'T

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:43.894 region:rollup2
OUR WORLD IS GOING.

00:47:41.726 --> 00:47:45.229 region:rollup2
OF CURRENT TODAY.

00:47:43.894 --> 00:47:46.697 region:rollup2
IS EVERYBODY IS KEENLY AWARE OF

00:47:45.229 --> 00:47:47.498 region:rollup2
THE SECURITY SECURITY IN THESE

00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:49.166 region:rollup2
KIND OF BUILDINGS AS I SAID

00:47:47.498 --> 00:47:50.801 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BEACONS.

00:47:49.166 --> 00:47:52.436 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE YOU MAINTAIN

00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:54.238 region:rollup2
SECURITY OF ALL THE VISITORS MAY

00:47:52.436 --> 00:47:55.539 region:rollup2
TO MAINTAIN SECURITY OF ALL THE

00:47:54.238 --> 00:47:56.440 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THE BUILDING

00:47:55.539 --> 00:47:58.642 region:rollup2
AND SECURITY TAKES ON MANY

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:59.510 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FACES.

00:47:58.642 --> 00:48:00.144 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:01.479 region:rollup2
BUILDING TAKES INTO

00:48:00.144 --> 00:48:03.714 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION HOW DO YOU HANDLE

00:48:01.479 --> 00:48:05.216 region:rollup2
A BUSLOAD OF VISITORS.

00:48:03.714 --> 00:48:06.117 region:rollup2
AND HOW DO YOU HANDLE THAN A

00:48:05.216 --> 00:48:07.218 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL FIRE WITHIN THE

00:48:06.117 --> 00:48:08.853 region:rollup2
BUILDING AND HOW DOES EVERYBODY

00:48:07.218 --> 00:48:09.587 region:rollup2
GET OUT OF BUILDING THAT'S PART

00:48:08.853 --> 00:48:10.721 region:rollup2
OF SECURITY CONCERNS AT THIS

00:48:09.587 --> 00:48:12.656 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:14.191 region:rollup2
IS ACTUALLY LIMITED AT THIS

00:48:12.656 --> 00:48:15.593 region:rollup2
POINT TIME AND. MARK HERE IN A

00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:17.161 region:rollup2
MINUTE HERE WILL TALK.

00:48:15.593 --> 00:48:18.662 region:rollup2
THROUGH SOME OF THE BUILDING

00:48:17.161 --> 00:48:21.532 region:rollup2
DEFICIENCIES THAT WERE.

00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:23.067 region:rollup2
ILLUSTRATING WITHIN OUR BLOCK.

00:48:21.532 --> 00:48:24.335 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS OF THIS TYPE

00:48:23.067 --> 00:48:26.036 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY HOUSE

00:48:24.335 --> 00:48:27.872 region:rollup2
SEPARATE TENANTS WITH SIMILAR

00:48:26.036 --> 00:48:29.206 region:rollup2
GOALS YOU END UP WITH.

00:48:27.872 --> 00:48:30.207 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE YOU END UP

00:48:29.206 --> 00:48:31.409 region:rollup2
WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN MANY

00:48:30.207 --> 00:48:32.610 region:rollup2
CASES JOINED UP WITH ELECTED

00:48:31.409 --> 00:48:34.311 region:rollup2
OFFICIAL OFFICES ALL IN THE SAME

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:35.146 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

00:48:34.311 --> 00:48:36.447 region:rollup2
THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT FOR

00:48:35.146 --> 00:48:38.048 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT BUT SIMILAR PURPOSES

00:48:36.447 --> 00:48:39.316 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE WORKING TOWARDS AND

00:48:38.048 --> 00:48:40.851 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE MAINTAIN

00:48:39.316 --> 00:48:41.919 region:rollup2
THOSE KIND OF ASPECTS OF. HOW

00:48:40.851 --> 00:48:43.254 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNMENT'S SUPPOSED TO

00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:44.588 region:rollup2
WORK WE NEED TO DEAL WITH WHAT

00:48:43.254 --> 00:48:47.091 region:rollup2
THE CONSTITUTIONAL? OUR

00:48:44.588 --> 00:48:48.793 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS ARE FACILITATE THE

00:48:47.091 --> 00:48:50.961 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO CONSTITUENTS.

00:48:48.793 --> 00:48:52.696 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE

00:48:50.961 --> 00:48:54.465 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE. ALL

00:48:52.696 --> 00:48:55.366 region:rollup2
WORKING IN THE BUILDING AND ON

00:48:54.465 --> 00:48:58.135 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING DURING THE

00:48:55.366 --> 00:48:59.336 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION PROCESS.

00:48:58.135 --> 00:48:59.603 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE. IN THIS IS

00:48:59.336 --> 00:49:01.439 region:rollup2
ONE OF MY.

00:48:59.603 --> 00:49:02.640 region:rollup2
.

00:49:01.439 --> 00:49:04.041 region:rollup2
CABBIE OUTSIDE ALL OF THIS

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:06.010 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE ELECTED

00:49:04.041 --> 00:49:07.745 region:rollup2
TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THIS.

00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:09.046 region:rollup2
GATHERING IN BRINGING TOGETHER

00:49:07.745 --> 00:49:10.214 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY WITH A SIMILAR IN

00:49:09.046 --> 00:49:12.349 region:rollup2
COMMON VISION TO BE ABLE TO

00:49:10.214 --> 00:49:14.985 region:rollup2
PROCEED AHEAD IS PARAMOUNT TO

00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:16.987 region:rollup2
MAKE THE PROCESS MOVE SMOOTHLY.

00:49:14.985 --> 00:49:18.055 region:rollup2
.

00:49:16.987 --> 00:49:19.790 region:rollup2
WHEN WE STARTED THIS PROJECT

00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:21.826 region:rollup2
RESTARTED IT WITH ESSENTIALLY

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:23.761 region:rollup2
FIVE OPTIONS THAT WE'RE LOOKING

00:49:21.826 --> 00:49:25.262 region:rollup2
AT IN NO PARTICULAR BIAS TO ANY

00:49:23.761 --> 00:49:26.363 region:rollup2
ONE OF THESE AS WE STARTED BUT

00:49:25.262 --> 00:49:28.199 region:rollup2
WE WANTED TO START AND THE

00:49:26.363 --> 00:49:29.200 region:rollup2
CONSERVATIVE NATURE.

00:49:28.199 --> 00:49:30.568 region:rollup2
WE START WITH THE IDEA THAT

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:32.169 region:rollup2
MAYBE ALL WE REALLY HAVE TO DO

00:49:30.568 --> 00:49:33.871 region:rollup2
IS FIX IT UP.

00:49:32.169 --> 00:49:34.104 region:rollup2
CAN KEEP THE BUILDING AS IT IS

00:49:33.871 --> 00:49:35.639 region:rollup2
WE CAN.

00:49:34.104 --> 00:49:37.041 region:rollup2
AND IN.

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:38.476 region:rollup2
MOST ARCHITECTS WORTH THEIR SALT

00:49:37.041 --> 00:49:41.011 region:rollup2
CAN SOLVE MOST OF THE.

00:49:38.476 --> 00:49:42.413 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES.

00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:43.581 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S A LOT THAT HAS TO BE

00:49:42.413 --> 00:49:45.082 region:rollup2
DONE IN THIS BUILDING AND

00:49:43.581 --> 00:49:46.884 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF NEED TO EXPRESS

00:49:45.082 --> 00:49:48.886 region:rollup2
DURING OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH

00:49:46.884 --> 00:49:50.621 region:rollup2
THE. USERS OF THE BUILDING THAT

00:49:48.886 --> 00:49:53.090 region:rollup2
WE CANNOT OVERCOME JUST BY

00:49:50.621 --> 00:49:54.124 region:rollup2
FIXING IT UP AS IT IS.

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:56.093 region:rollup2
OUR WE LOOKED AT REMODELING THE

00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:56.994 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

00:49:56.093 --> 00:49:58.295 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY AS INVASIVE

00:49:56.994 --> 00:49:59.363 region:rollup2
AS.

00:49:58.295 --> 00:50:00.464 region:rollup2
PRETTY MUCH THE REST OF WHAT

00:49:59.363 --> 00:50:02.032 region:rollup2
I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT HERE

00:50:00.464 --> 00:50:03.334 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MOVE PEOPLE

00:50:02.032 --> 00:50:05.402 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE BUILDING TO REMODEL

00:50:03.334 --> 00:50:05.903 region:rollup2
MECHANICAL ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS

00:50:05.402 --> 00:50:07.004 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE

00:50:05.903 --> 00:50:08.072 region:rollup2
MAINTAINED.

00:50:07.004 --> 00:50:09.540 region:rollup2
FOR PARTS OF THE BUILDING AND

00:50:08.072 --> 00:50:10.508 region:rollup2
MOST THESE BUILDINGS WERE NOT

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.909 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DESIGNED WITH THE IDEA

00:50:10.508 --> 00:50:13.644 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN SHUT OFF THIS

00:50:11.909 --> 00:50:14.612 region:rollup2
OFFICE IN TURN THIS OFFICE ON

00:50:13.644 --> 00:50:15.946 region:rollup2
HERE. SO.

00:50:14.612 --> 00:50:17.715 region:rollup2
GENERALLY SPEAKING UP TO

00:50:15.946 --> 00:50:19.483 region:rollup2
RELOCATE OUT OF THE BUILDING TO

00:50:17.715 --> 00:50:20.951 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO DO A FULL REMODEL.

00:50:19.483 --> 00:50:23.554 region:rollup2
IT WOULD NOT ACTUALLY.

00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:25.289 region:rollup2
GIVE YOU ALL THE BENEFITS

00:50:23.554 --> 00:50:25.890 region:rollup2
IN THE REMODEL ANY MUCH MORE

00:50:25.289 --> 00:50:27.358 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU WOULD

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:27.524 region:rollup2
GET.

00:50:27.358 --> 00:50:30.194 region:rollup2
IN.

00:50:27.524 --> 00:50:31.328 region:rollup2
SIMPLY CHANGING THE PROBLEMS

00:50:30.194 --> 00:50:34.298 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CURRENTLY NO THERE

00:50:31.328 --> 00:50:35.366 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE BUILDING.

00:50:34.298 --> 00:50:36.567 region:rollup2
THIRDLY AS WE LOOKED AT IT WE

00:50:35.366 --> 00:50:37.968 region:rollup2
SAID THEN ONE OF THE BETTER

00:50:36.567 --> 00:50:39.336 region:rollup2
OPTIONS MIGHT BE ADDING ON TO

00:50:37.968 --> 00:50:41.171 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING SO WE STARTED OUT

00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:43.307 region:rollup2
WITH THE IDEA. THAT WHAT IF WE

00:50:41.171 --> 00:50:44.475 region:rollup2
JUST REMODELED THE PARTS WE HAD

00:50:43.307 --> 00:50:45.876 region:rollup2
IN AND OUT ADD ON TO THE

00:50:44.475 --> 00:50:47.077 region:rollup2
BUILDING WE COULD WE ACTUALLY

00:50:45.876 --> 00:50:48.312 region:rollup2
SATISFY THE NEEDS. THEIR

00:50:47.077 --> 00:50:49.780 region:rollup2
EXPRESSED TO US OR VARIOUS

00:50:48.312 --> 00:50:51.282 region:rollup2
MEETINGS.

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:52.616 region:rollup2
AS IT CAME TO BE WE FOUND THAT

00:50:51.282 --> 00:50:54.184 region:rollup2
IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT WORKING

00:50:52.616 --> 00:50:56.120 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE EXISTING STRUCTURAL

00:50:54.184 --> 00:50:57.087 region:rollup2
GREG WITHIN THE BUILDING. AND

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.355 region:rollup2
THE FLOOR TO CEILING HEIGHTS

00:50:57.087 --> 00:50:59.857 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE BUILDING

00:50:58.355 --> 00:51:01.892 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO FACILITATE BEING

00:50:59.857 --> 00:51:03.227 region:rollup2
ABLE TO APPLY ALL THE DESIRES

00:51:01.892 --> 00:51:05.896 region:rollup2
AND NEEDS THAT WERE EXPRESSED TO

00:51:03.227 --> 00:51:07.531 region:rollup2
US DURING OUR CONVERSATION.

00:51:05.896 --> 00:51:09.600 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY WE CAME TO.

00:51:07.531 --> 00:51:10.067 region:rollup2
AND THE WITHIN THE ACTUAL BILL

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:12.269 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:13.804 region:rollup2
PUT THIS FORWARD IT WAS ABOUT

00:51:12.269 --> 00:51:15.372 region:rollup2
REMOVING AND REPLACING THE

00:51:13.804 --> 00:51:16.974 region:rollup2
BUILDING OR.

00:51:15.372 --> 00:51:18.509 region:rollup2
REMODELING THE BUILDING AND SO

00:51:16.974 --> 00:51:20.444 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY EXPANDED UPON THAT

00:51:18.509 --> 00:51:20.978 region:rollup2
AS WE WENT THROUGH TO SAY WHAT

00:51:20.444 --> 00:51:22.246 region:rollup2
OTHER OPTIONS YOU MAY HELP

00:51:20.978 --> 00:51:24.214 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE.

00:51:22.246 --> 00:51:25.115 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY FALL UPON THEY REMOVE

00:51:24.214 --> 00:51:27.685 region:rollup2
AND REPLACE OPTION WITHIN THE.

00:51:25.115 --> 00:51:29.153 region:rollup2
.

00:51:27.685 --> 00:51:32.056 region:rollup2
REPLACES BUILDING WITHIN.

00:51:29.153 --> 00:51:33.657 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING LOCATION.

00:51:32.056 --> 00:51:35.059 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE ALSO LOOKED AT THE

00:51:33.657 --> 00:51:36.327 region:rollup2
OPTION OF

00:51:35.059 --> 00:51:38.562 region:rollup2
BUILDING A NEW BUILDING OUR NEW

00:51:36.327 --> 00:51:39.129 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS AS SOME PEOPLE MAY

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:40.731 region:rollup2
HAVE SEEN.

00:51:39.129 --> 00:51:41.799 region:rollup2
ALREADY PUBLISHED IT AND DURING

00:51:40.731 --> 00:51:44.602 region:rollup2
POINT TIME IN A DIFFERENT

00:51:41.799 --> 00:51:45.703 region:rollup2
LOCATION.

00:51:44.602 --> 00:51:47.304 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR REPORT HERE AS WE

00:51:45.703 --> 00:51:48.539 region:rollup2
TALK HOPEFULLY WE'LL SEE IS WHY

00:51:47.304 --> 00:51:50.374 region:rollup2
WE CAME TO THEIR CONCLUSIONS

00:51:48.539 --> 00:51:51.375 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAME TO.

00:51:50.374 --> 00:51:53.444 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE ROOM

00:51:51.375 --> 00:51:56.146 region:rollup2
MOVING REPLACE WAS THE ONE THAT.

00:51:53.444 --> 00:51:57.815 region:rollup2
WAS THEM MOST EASY TO SATISFY

00:51:56.146 --> 00:51:59.383 region:rollup2
ALL THE DESIRES OF THE.

00:51:57.815 --> 00:52:00.417 region:rollup2
CODE ISSUES ALL THE SAFETY

00:51:59.383 --> 00:52:00.584 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

00:52:00.417 --> 00:52:02.219 region:rollup2
AND.

00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:03.320 region:rollup2
.

00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:04.588 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE NEEDS FOR THE

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.155 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SQUARE FOOTAGE WITHIN

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:06.957 region:rollup2
THE BUILDINGS WOULD BE CAN.

00:52:05.155 --> 00:52:08.058 region:rollup2
.

00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:09.493 region:rollup2
MORE CONSISTENTLY DONE AND

00:52:08.058 --> 00:52:11.629 region:rollup2
RESOLVE SOME OF THE WAY FUNDING

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:12.863 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT WE ACTUALLY KNOW OF.

00:52:11.629 --> 00:52:13.430 region:rollup2
BUILDING IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION

00:52:12.863 --> 00:52:14.031 region:rollup2
WAS CONSIDERED STRONGLY VOTE

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:15.866 region:rollup2
WAS.

00:52:14.031 --> 00:52:16.300 region:rollup2
.

00:52:15.866 --> 00:52:17.568 region:rollup2
RESOUND ONLY RESENT.

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:19.303 region:rollup2
.

00:52:17.568 --> 00:52:21.705 region:rollup2
I'D TAKEN OFF THE LIST BECAUSE

00:52:19.303 --> 00:52:22.539 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA

00:52:21.705 --> 00:52:24.141 region:rollup2
OF BEING SEPARATED FROM THE

00:52:22.539 --> 00:52:25.376 region:rollup2
CHAMBERS.

00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:27.578 region:rollup2
AND SEPARATED FROM THEIR

00:52:25.376 --> 00:52:27.878 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS AND HAVING TO WALK

00:52:27.578 --> 00:52:30.347 region:rollup2
ACROSS STE.

00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:31.815 region:rollup2
AN AREA OF SURFACE

00:52:30.347 --> 00:52:33.250 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK AND FORTH

00:52:31.815 --> 00:52:34.318 region:rollup2
IN A TIMELY FASHION TO BE ABLE

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:40.190 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT HEARINGS AND

00:52:34.318 --> 00:52:41.825 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING STARTED ON TIME.

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:43.527 region:rollup2
WHAT I'D LIKE TO START WITH ON

00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:46.430 region:rollup2
OUR NEXT SLIDE HERE IS?

00:52:43.527 --> 00:52:48.265 region:rollup2
?

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:49.333 region:rollup2

THAT WERE PROVIDED.

00:52:49.333 --> 00:52:51.402 region:rollup2
PART OF THE WAY THROUGH THE

00:52:50.534 --> 00:52:53.037 region:rollup2
PROCESS YOU'LL FIND IT WITHIN

00:52:51.402 --> 00:52:54.238 region:rollup2

TO US BY ASSEMBLYMAN COOLEY

00:52:57.207 --> 00:53:00.310 region:rollup2
WHICH WE ACTUALLY THOUGHT WAS.

00:52:58.509 --> 00:53:00.911 region:rollup2
VERY APROPOS FOR ACTUALLY MOST

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:02.212 region:rollup2

00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:04.114 region:rollup2
DOING AND I'LL JUST READ IT TO

00:53:02.212 --> 00:53:06.483 region:rollup2
YOU QUICKLY.

00:53:04.114 --> 00:53:07.751 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S NEW

00:53:06.483 --> 00:53:09.486 region:rollup2
CAPITAL ANNEX SHOULD CONVEY THAT

00:53:07.751 --> 00:53:10.888 region:rollup2
TO THE VISITORS.

00:53:09.486 --> 00:53:13.924 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S POSITIVE AND

00:53:10.888 --> 00:53:15.459 region:rollup2
HOPEFUL HOLE FILLED OUTLOOK.

00:53:13.924 --> 00:53:18.295 region:rollup2
FOUNDED UPON A DELIBERATIVE

00:53:15.459 --> 00:53:20.030 region:rollup2
DEMOCRACY WHICH UNFOLDS THERE.

00:53:18.295 --> 00:53:21.832 region:rollup2
BY WELCOMING ALL CALIFORNIANS

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:23.033 region:rollup2
ENGAGING ALL CALIFORNIANS

00:53:21.832 --> 00:53:25.335 region:rollup2
SAFEGUARDING THE FUTURE OF ALL

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:27.538 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS.

00:53:25.335 --> 00:53:28.439 region:rollup2
AND DEMONSTRATING A HEALTHFUL.

00:53:27.538 --> 00:53:31.408 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBLE AND SUSTAINABLE

00:53:28.439 --> 00:53:32.810 region:rollup2
DESIGN.

00:53:31.408 --> 00:53:33.911 region:rollup2
LET ME STOP THERE REAL QUICK SO

00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:35.446 region:rollup2
WHERE ESSENTIALLY WHAT THAT IS

00:53:33.911 --> 00:53:39.116 region:rollup2
SAYING IS THAT THE BUILDING

00:53:35.446 --> 00:53:42.019 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ENGAGING TO EVERYONE.

00:53:39.116 --> 00:53:44.722 region:rollup2
AND BY DEMONSTRATING

00:53:42.019 --> 00:53:45.823 region:rollup2
BEING EXAMPLE FOR YOUR STATE.

00:53:44.722 --> 00:53:46.423 region:rollup2
OF THE KIND OF ARCHITECTURE AND

00:53:45.823 --> 00:53:48.692 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION YOU WOULD LIKE TO

00:53:46.423 --> 00:53:49.793 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:53:48.692 --> 00:53:51.295 region:rollup2
WHILE PRESERVING THE BEAUTY AND

00:53:49.793 --> 00:53:52.396 region:rollup2

00:54:01.405 --> 00:54:04.908 region:rollup2
CAPITALS IN THE NATION.

00:54:03.407 --> 00:54:06.343 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S VERY ASPIRATIONAL

00:54:04.908 --> 00:54:08.412 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY.

00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:09.046 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY ACCURATE AND WHAT

00:54:08.412 --> 00:54:11.348 region:rollup2
A CAPITOL BUILDING WOULD LIKE TO

00:54:09.046 --> 00:54:13.350 region:rollup2
HAVE DONE.

TO FOLLOW THROUGH THE BOOK AND

00:54:37.374 --> 00:54:39.409 region:rollup2
WHY WE DID WHAT WE DID WITHIN

00:54:39.076 --> 00:54:41.278 region:rollup2
THE. REPORT.

00:54:39.409 --> 00:54:43.881 region:rollup2

SO PLANNING STUDY AND SUMMARY OF

00:54:47.751 --> 00:54:52.456 region:rollup2
STUDY EFFORTS.

00:54:50.487 --> 00:54:54.424 region:rollup2
THE PURPOSE FOR THE STUDY.

00:54:52.456 --> 00:54:55.092 region:rollup2
AS WE WERE SETTING OUT.

00:54:54.424 --> 00:54:56.560 region:rollup2
WAS TO ROUTE.

00:54:55.092 --> 00:54:57.761 region:rollup2
REMEDY THE EXISTING BUILDING

00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:00.364 region:rollup2
DEFICIENCIES AND ENHANCE THE

00:54:57.761 --> 00:55:01.665 region:rollup2
ABILITY. OF THE FACILITY.

00:55:00.364 --> 00:55:05.435 region:rollup2
TO MEET THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

00:55:01.665 --> 00:55:06.003 region:rollup2
NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE.

WHAT YOU'LL FIND WITHIN THE

00:55:06.003 --> 00:55:09.673 region:rollup2
REPORT?

00:55:07.437 --> 00:55:10.207 region:rollup2
IS SECTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:55:09.673 --> 00:55:12.009 region:rollup2
INFORMATION GATHERING AND

00:55:10.207 --> 00:55:14.978 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND.

00:55:12.009 --> 00:55:19.249 region:rollup2
GOAL SETTING.

00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:22.152 region:rollup2
WHICH WE CALL DESIGN GOALS.

00:55:19.249 --> 00:55:24.388 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKE.

00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:26.323 region:rollup2
PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS.

00:55:24.388 --> 00:55:27.457 region:rollup2
OF WHICH WE HAVE SOME TWO DOZEN

00:55:26.323 --> 00:55:29.660 region:rollup2
PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS

00:55:27.457 --> 00:55:31.829 region:rollup2
ILLUSTRATED WITHIN THE BOOK.

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:33.664 region:rollup2
A FEW THOSE ARE SUCH THINGS AS.

00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:34.464 region:rollup2
MAINTAINING THE BEAUTY OF THE

00:55:33.664 --> 00:55:36.633 region:rollup2
HISTORICAL.

00:55:34.464 --> 00:55:37.167 region:rollup2
PARK AS WELL AS MAINTAINING THE

00:55:36.633 --> 00:55:40.637 region:rollup2
HIGHER KEY OF THE CAPITOL

00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:41.939 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

00:55:40.637 --> 00:55:43.240 region:rollup2
WHATEVER PLAYING CONSIDERATIONS

00:55:41.939 --> 00:55:44.808 region:rollup2
IS KNOWN STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCIES

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:47.311 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING ITSELF WOULD HAVE

00:55:44.808 --> 00:55:48.979 region:rollup2
BASED ON STUDIES PROVIDED TO US.

00:55:47.311 --> 00:55:50.747 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE DG ES UM FACILITY

00:55:48.979 --> 00:55:52.082 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT.

00:55:50.747 --> 00:55:54.151 region:rollup2
THERE'S KNOWN STRUCTURAL

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:55.219 region:rollup2
DEFICIENCIES FOR SEISMIC AT FOR

00:55:54.151 --> 00:55:57.521 region:rollup2
YOUR TO COMPLY WITH TODAY'S

00:55:55.219 --> 00:55:58.422 region:rollup2
MODERN BUILDING CODES.

00:55:57.521 --> 00:55:59.556 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT I

00:55:58.422 --> 00:56:01.058 region:rollup2
THINK YOU'RE IS PARAMOUNT FOR

00:55:59.556 --> 00:56:03.060 region:rollup2
YOU TO CONSIDER IS.

00:56:01.058 --> 00:56:05.462 region:rollup2
DURING CONSTRUCTION.

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:07.598 region:rollup2
IN ALL CASES EXCEPT FOR FIX IN

00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:08.532 region:rollup2
PLACE.

00:56:07.598 --> 00:56:10.067 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD NEED TO HAVE WHAT WE

00:56:08.532 --> 00:56:11.768 region:rollup2
CLASSIFY SWING SPACES WHICH ARE

00:56:10.067 --> 00:56:13.036 region:rollup2
SPACES WHERE THE PEOPLE IN THE

00:56:11.768 --> 00:56:14.538 region:rollup2
OCCUPANTS OF THE BUILDING AS

00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:15.906 region:rollup2
WELL AS THE PUBLIC THEMSELVES.

00:56:14.538 --> 00:56:17.374 region:rollup2
WOULD BE RELOCATED TO DIFFERENT

00:56:15.906 --> 00:56:19.409 region:rollup2
LOCATIONS.

00:56:17.374 --> 00:56:21.545 region:rollup2
AND THE.

00:56:19.409 --> 00:56:22.846 region:rollup2
THUS PRECIPITATING THE WHOLE

00:56:21.545 --> 00:56:24.214 region:rollup2
PUBLIC INFORMATION SYSTEM SO

00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:25.249 region:rollup2
THEY KNOW WHERE TO GO AND HOW TO

00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:27.451 region:rollup2
USE THE CAPITOL BUILDING DURING

00:56:25.249 --> 00:56:29.486 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION PROCESS.

00:56:27.451 --> 00:56:31.021 region:rollup2
AND. LASTLY I'LL JUST NOTE HERE

00:56:29.486 --> 00:56:32.456 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE TWO DOZEN WE HAVE.

00:56:31.021 --> 00:56:34.424 region:rollup2
THE DIRECT CONNECT OF THIS

00:56:32.456 --> 00:56:35.659 region:rollup2
BUILDING TO THE CAPITOL BUILDING

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:37.628 region:rollup2
ITSELF THE.

00:56:35.659 --> 00:56:38.795 region:rollup2
HISTORIC UP NOBODY.

00:56:37.628 --> 00:56:40.130 region:rollup2
THAT HAS TO BE DONE IN A VERY

00:56:38.795 --> 00:56:41.098 region:rollup2
SENSITIVE SORT OF WAY AND DURING

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.766 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:56:41.098 --> 00:56:43.800 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATIONS IS MAKING SURE

00:56:42.766 --> 00:56:46.003 region:rollup2
THAT YOU HAVE NOT LEFT THE

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:47.537 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT OF THE EXISTING.

00:56:46.003 --> 00:56:49.506 region:rollup2
HISTORICAL CAPITOL BUILDING

00:56:47.537 --> 00:56:50.841 region:rollup2
WHICH WILL MAY BE MAINTAINED.

00:56:49.506 --> 00:56:53.043 region:rollup2
AND IN A STATE WHERE IT CAN BE

00:56:50.841 --> 00:56:55.045 region:rollup2
UTILIZED BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT

00:56:53.043 --> 00:56:56.079 region:rollup2
YOU CAN UTILIZE THE CHAMBERS.

00:56:55.045 --> 00:56:57.447 region:rollup2
YOU CAN UTILIZE THE HEARING

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:58.815 region:rollup2
SPACES IN THE MEETING ROOMS

00:56:57.447 --> 00:57:00.717 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE HISTORIC CAPITAL

00:56:58.815 --> 00:57:01.785 region:rollup2
WHILE THIS CONSTRUCTION GOES ON

00:57:00.717 --> 00:57:02.853 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WILL BE A PLANNING

00:57:01.785 --> 00:57:04.254 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION DURING THE ACTUAL

00:57:02.853 --> 00:57:05.489 region:rollup2
DESIGN.

00:57:04.254 --> 00:57:08.425 region:rollup2
IF I MAY JUMP IN FOR JUST A

00:57:05.489 --> 00:57:11.128 region:rollup2
MOMENT YOU BETCHA ON THIS POINT.

00:57:08.425 --> 00:57:12.329 region:rollup2
A ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE

00:57:11.128 --> 00:57:14.665 region:rollup2
IS WE HAVE TO CHAMBERS

00:57:12.329 --> 00:57:15.632 region:rollup2
THE HISTORIC CHAMBERS.

00:57:14.665 --> 00:57:16.433 region:rollup2
BUT AS SOON AS YOU STEP OUT OF

00:57:15.632 --> 00:57:18.468 region:rollup2
THE CHAMBERS FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:57:16.433 --> 00:57:20.370 region:rollup2
SENATE SIDE.

00:57:18.468 --> 00:57:21.805 region:rollup2
OUR THE MATTED LOUNGE THE DAVE

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:23.774 region:rollup2
* LOUNGE

00:57:21.805 --> 00:57:25.142 region:rollup2
THE SERGEANTS OFFICE ROOM THIRTY

ONE NINETY ONE YOU'RE VERY

00:57:25.142 --> 00:57:29.780 region:rollup2
USEFUL HEARING ROOM.

00:57:26.977 --> 00:57:31.114 region:rollup2
A THESE ARE ALL IN THE ANNEX.

00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:31.982 region:rollup2
SEVERE ADDRESSING THE ANNEX YOU

00:57:31.114 --> 00:57:34.418 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY AFFECT THE

00:57:31.982 --> 00:57:36.486 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONALITY OF THE CHAMBERS.

00:57:34.418 --> 00:57:37.921 region:rollup2
AND SO A LONG TERM STRATEGY HAS

00:57:36.486 --> 00:57:40.557 region:rollup2
TO WE HAD WE RETAIN THAT

00:57:37.921 --> 00:57:42.259 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONALITY. FOR THE MEMBERS.

00:57:40.557 --> 00:57:43.627 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THE OTHER ASPECT OF

00:57:42.259 --> 00:57:45.462 region:rollup2
THIS AND I WANT TO POINT TO THIS

00:57:43.627 --> 00:57:47.831 region:rollup2
CHART DO YOU SEE DOWN THERE THAT

00:57:45.462 --> 00:57:48.966 region:rollup2
COLORFUL CHART ON THE FAR WALL.

00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:50.600 region:rollup2
THAT'S ACTUALLY DO ONE THE

00:57:48.966 --> 00:57:52.202 region:rollup2
UNIQUE VALUE ADS OF THIS REPORT

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:53.303 region:rollup2
DONE BY THIS FIRM.

00:57:52.202 --> 00:57:55.138 region:rollup2
AS HE TALKED TO PEOPLE.

00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:56.606 region:rollup2
THEY'VE.

00:57:55.138 --> 00:57:58.742 region:rollup2
KEPT TRACK OF WHERE TO MEMBERS

00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:59.977 region:rollup2
SPEND THEIR TIME.

00:57:58.742 --> 00:58:01.011 region:rollup2
WHEN A MEMBER RISE IN THE BILL

00:57:59.977 --> 00:58:02.679 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'RE

00:58:01.011 --> 00:58:03.680 region:rollup2
DOING DURING THE DAY.

00:58:02.679 --> 00:58:05.615 region:rollup2
AND THAT CHARTER IS BASS HE

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:07.417 region:rollup2
SHOWS AT THE TOP YOU ENTER YOU

00:58:18.462 --> 00:58:21.098 region:rollup2
WE GET A LOT DONE IN A VERY

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:23.066 region:rollup2
COMPACT SPACE HERE IN

00:58:21.098 --> 00:58:24.568 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:58:23.066 --> 00:58:26.970 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THIS ORIENTATION OF

00:58:24.568 --> 00:58:28.338 region:rollup2
WEST WING ANNEX.

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:30.707 region:rollup2
THAT MAKES EVERYONE OF OUR DAYS

00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:31.708 region:rollup2
EXTRAORDINARILY PRODUCTIVE.

00:58:30.707 --> 00:58:33.343 region:rollup2
AND I WILL SAY IS ACTUALLY

00:58:31.708 --> 00:58:35.112 region:rollup2
PRETTY UNIQUE IS DEFINITELY

00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:36.713 region:rollup2
WASHINGTON MODEL.

00:58:35.112 --> 00:58:37.948 region:rollup2
AND MOST OTHER STATES LAWMAKERS

00:58:36.713 --> 00:58:39.349 region:rollup2
IN THAT HAVE.

00:58:37.948 --> 00:58:40.884 region:rollup2
HIKE ALL OVER THE PLACE TO GET

00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:42.853 region:rollup2
THEIR WORK DONE SO IT'S SORT OF

00:58:40.884 --> 00:58:44.154 region:rollup2
DEGRADES WHAT THEY CAN KNOCK OUT

00:58:42.853 --> 00:58:45.655 region:rollup2
IN A DAY.

00:58:44.154 --> 00:58:47.457 region:rollup2
SO I THINK AS HE TALKS ABOUT

00:58:45.655 --> 00:58:49.226 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE OF. LOOK AT THESE

00:58:47.457 --> 00:58:50.761 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS.

00:58:49.226 --> 00:58:52.929 region:rollup2
I WANT TO JUST PUT A FLAG ON

00:58:50.761 --> 00:58:54.131 region:rollup2
THAT CHART BECAUSE I THINK.

00:58:52.929 --> 00:58:54.698 region:rollup2
THAT REVEALS A LOT ABOUT HOW WE

00:58:54.131 --> 00:58:56.700 region:rollup2
ARE PRODUCTIVE.

00:58:54.698 --> 00:58:59.736 region:rollup2
.

00:58:56.700 --> 00:59:01.238 region:rollup2

INDIVIDUALLY AND IN DIFFERENT

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:10.046 region:rollup2
GROUPINGS TO VISIT.

00:59:08.545 --> 00:59:12.983 region:rollup2
QUITE A FEW CAPITOL BUILDINGS

00:59:10.046 --> 00:59:14.017 region:rollup2
pFUNCTION ALSO AND HOW THEY'VE

00:59:12.983 --> 00:59:15.685 region:rollup2
DONE THEIR RENOVATION PROJECTS

00:59:14.017 --> 00:59:17.421 region:rollup2
I'VE. PERSONALLY BEEN TO ABOUT

00:59:15.685 --> 00:59:19.156 region:rollup2
TWELVE AMONG THE. EASTERN SIDE

YOU'RE CAPITOL BUILDING IS IN A

00:59:26.163 --> 00:59:28.899 region:rollup2
UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE YOU TOOK

00:59:27.397 --> 00:59:30.100 region:rollup2
A HISTORIC CAPITAL AND YOU PUT

00:59:28.899 --> 00:59:32.202 region:rollup2
THE OFFICE BUILDING.

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:33.170 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE

00:59:32.202 --> 00:59:36.773 region:rollup2
CAPITOL BUILDING IN THAT DOES

00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:38.375 region:rollup2
NOT HAPPEN TERRIBLY OFTEN.

00:59:36.773 --> 00:59:39.142 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY I GUESS IS WE WALK

00:59:38.375 --> 00:59:41.044 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR REPORT WE.

00:59:39.142 --> 00:59:43.246 region:rollup2
.

00:59:41.044 --> 00:59:44.014 region:rollup2
LOOK THE TABULAR DATA. AND THIS

00:59:43.246 --> 00:59:45.715 region:rollup2
IS ESSENTIALLY SPREADSHEETS.

00:59:44.014 --> 00:59:47.217 region:rollup2
.

00:59:45.715 --> 00:59:48.118 region:rollup2
WE LOOKED AT THE SURVEYS AND

00:59:47.217 --> 00:59:49.920 region:rollup2
REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE IN

00:59:48.118 --> 00:59:51.421 region:rollup2
THE PAST.

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:53.290 region:rollup2
WE LOOKED AT INFORMATION WAS

00:59:51.421 --> 00:59:54.991 region:rollup2
PROVIDED TO US THAT WAS FROM THE

00:59:53.290 --> 00:59:56.226 region:rollup2
SIXTIES FROM THE SEVENTIES.

00:59:54.991 --> 00:59:57.561 region:rollup2
AND SOME INFORMATION WE HAVE

00:59:56.226 --> 00:59:59.529 region:rollup2
FROM THE EIGHTIES. THAT

00:59:57.561 --> 01:00:00.864 region:rollup2
INFORMATION HELPED FEED OUR

00:59:59.529 --> 01:00:02.065 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE

01:00:00.864 --> 01:00:03.767 region:rollup2
DESIRES AND NEEDS FOR THE

01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:05.969 region:rollup2
CAPITAL WERE OVER A LONG PERIOD

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:07.704 region:rollup2
OF TIME.

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:08.305 region:rollup2
THE WORLD IS CHANGED A LOT SINCE

01:00:07.704 --> 01:00:09.473 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE STUDIES WERE OUT

01:00:08.305 --> 01:00:10.574 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:00:09.473 --> 01:00:12.008 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT WAS A PART TIME

01:00:10.574 --> 01:00:13.677 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AND OF WHICH IT IS

01:00:12.008 --> 01:00:15.178 region:rollup2
NOT NOW.

01:00:13.677 --> 01:00:16.413 region:rollup2
AND THE WAY THAT THE PUBLIC

01:00:15.178 --> 01:00:17.647 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY CAN GET TO AND GET

01:00:16.413 --> 01:00:19.583 region:rollup2
INFORMATION FROM THE CAPITALIST

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:20.717 region:rollup2
CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY.

01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:22.052 region:rollup2
THE SPREADSHEETS THEN TALLY UP

01:00:20.717 --> 01:00:23.753 region:rollup2
THE.

01:00:22.052 --> 01:00:24.855 region:rollup2
WAY THE CURRENT BUILDING WORKS

01:00:23.753 --> 01:00:26.022 region:rollup2
AND THE ADJACENT SEASON ARE

01:00:24.855 --> 01:00:27.958 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY WITHIN THE BUILDING TO

01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:29.392 region:rollup2
LOOK FOR. IT EITHER ADVANTAGES

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:31.428 region:rollup2
OR DISADVANTAGES ASSOCIATED WITH

01:00:29.392 --> 01:00:32.496 region:rollup2
THAT AS WELL AS WHEN WE DID

01:00:31.428 --> 01:00:34.131 region:rollup2
PROJECTIONS. BASED ON OUR

01:00:32.496 --> 01:00:35.365 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS AND BASED ON A

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:37.167 region:rollup2
PROGRAMMING EFFORT WHICH WILL

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:37.934 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT LATER. TO HOW MANY

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:39.703 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:41.571 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING ACTUALLY NEED TELL

01:00:39.703 --> 01:00:42.806 region:rollup2
ME HEARING ROOMS THE BUILDING

01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:43.206 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY NEEDS AND WE WE.

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:44.808 region:rollup2
BALANCE THOSE TWO.

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:46.076 region:rollup2
.

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:47.544 region:rollup2
SPREADSHEETS OFF OF EACH OTHER

01:00:46.076 --> 01:00:49.546 region:rollup2
AND ULTIMATELY.

01:00:47.544 --> 01:00:51.081 region:rollup2
WE.

01:00:49.546 --> 01:00:52.582 region:rollup2
WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF

01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:56.086 region:rollup2
PROVIDING YOU WITH IN THE BOOK.

01:00:52.582 --> 01:00:57.487 region:rollup2
CONCLUSIONS OR RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:00:56.086 --> 01:00:58.488 region:rollup2
SO THE NEXT LIKE PLEASE SO NOW

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:59.823 region:rollup2
WHAT I WANT TO DO IS JUST TALK A

01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:01.424 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT SOME OF

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:02.058 region:rollup2
THOSE EFFORTS WERE TO CREATE

01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:03.126 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE SECTIONS WITHIN THE

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:05.328 region:rollup2
BOOK.

01:01:03.126 --> 01:01:05.996 region:rollup2
.

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:07.564 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION GATHERING

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:08.899 region:rollup2
UNKNOWN DOCUMENTS AS I SAID WAS

01:01:07.564 --> 01:01:10.834 region:rollup2
TO CALL THROUGH HISTORIC

01:01:08.899 --> 01:01:11.101 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTATION.

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:12.836 region:rollup2
GENERATE.

01:01:11.101 --> 01:01:14.404 region:rollup2
.

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:15.839 region:rollup2
INFORMATION BASED ON THE KNOWN

01:01:14.404 --> 01:01:18.208 region:rollup2
AND EXISTING FACILITIES THAT YOU

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:19.576 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY HAVE.

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:21.912 region:rollup2
AND TRY TO ANALYZE WHY IS IT

01:01:19.576 --> 01:01:22.979 region:rollup2
BEING DONE THAT WAY.

01:01:21.912 --> 01:01:24.314 region:rollup2
THERE WAS DIFFICULT FOR US TO

01:01:22.979 --> 01:01:25.782 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY INITIALLY UNDERSTAND

01:01:24.314 --> 01:01:26.883 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHILE THE SINK WHEN

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:28.852 region:rollup2
TOGETHER BUT AS WE WENT THROUGH

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:30.220 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS WHICH WE USE ALL OF

01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:31.521 region:rollup2
THESE SMALL BITS OF DETAILS TO%

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:32.489 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND YOUR GOVERNMENT

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:33.723 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY BETTER THAN YOU

01:01:32.489 --> 01:01:35.025 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND HOW YOU WORK WITHIN

01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:36.560 region:rollup2
YOUR OWN WALLS BECAUSE. YOU'RE

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:37.727 region:rollup2
DOING A JOB AND WE NEED TO BE

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.963 region:rollup2
ABLE TO SEE HOW YOUR GHOSTS ARE

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:41.598 region:rollup2
MOVING AROUND.

01:01:39.963 --> 01:01:43.166 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING IN HIGH LEVEL

01:01:41.598 --> 01:01:44.801 region:rollup2
GOAL SETTING MEETINGS

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:46.202 region:rollup2
THIS RIGHT HERE IS A POIGNANT

01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:47.804 region:rollup2
TIME WITHIN THE PROJECT BECAUSE

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:48.738 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS. WHAT

01:01:47.804 --> 01:01:50.440 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU ASPIRE TO HAVE THIS

01:01:48.738 --> 01:01:52.609 region:rollup2
BUILDING TO?

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.544 region:rollup2
DOES THE CURRENT BUILDING APPLY

01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:55.178 region:rollup2
WELL TO YOUR ASPIRATIONS OF WHAT

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:57.047 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD LIKE THIS BUILDING TO

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:58.114 region:rollup2
DO.

01:01:57.047 --> 01:01:59.249 region:rollup2
WE WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS WE

01:01:58.114 --> 01:02:01.685 region:rollup2
TALK TO.

01:01:59.249 --> 01:02:03.186 region:rollup2
CAPITAL OCCUPANTS AND LEADERS

01:02:01.685 --> 01:02:04.721 region:rollup2
TWO I GENERATE A LIST OF GOALS

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:05.255 region:rollup2
WHICH DANIEL WEAVER WILL WALK

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:07.958 region:rollup2
YOU THROUGH HERE IN A FEW

01:02:05.255 --> 01:02:09.226 region:rollup2
MINUTES.

01:02:07.958 --> 01:02:10.627 region:rollup2
WE CONDUCTED INTERVIEWS AS I'VE

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:11.995 region:rollup2
MENTIONED A COUPLE TIMES THOSE

01:02:10.627 --> 01:02:14.030 region:rollup2
INTERVIEWS WERE YOU INTERVIEWED

01:02:11.995 --> 01:02:15.131 region:rollup2
SOME FIFTY PLUS PEOPLE. AND TALK

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:16.900 region:rollup2
TO MORE THAN THAT BUT.

01:02:15.131 --> 01:02:18.301 region:rollup2
WE DID ACTUALLY ARTICULATE ALL

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.868 region:rollup2
THEIR NAMES BUT MOST OF THOSE

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:20.136 region:rollup2
ARE ILLUSTRATED WITH IN THE

01:02:18.868 --> 01:02:21.271 region:rollup2
BOOK.

01:02:20.136 --> 01:02:22.572 region:rollup2
OF THE PEOPLE THAT SAT DOWN WITH

01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:24.174 region:rollup2
US AND GAVE US INFORMATION WE

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:26.076 region:rollup2
TOLD THEM THAT WE WOULD TAKE

01:02:24.174 --> 01:02:27.644 region:rollup2
THEIR INFORMATION WITHOUT. BIAS

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:29.312 region:rollup2
TO THE INFORMATION AND WE DIDN'T

01:02:27.644 --> 01:02:30.547 region:rollup2
NAME ANYBODY FOR THEIR SPECIFIC

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:31.848 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THEY GAVE US SO THEY

01:02:30.547 --> 01:02:33.817 region:rollup2
FEEL COMFORTABLE IN TELLING US

01:02:31.848 --> 01:02:34.351 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THEY WANTED TO TELL US

01:02:33.817 --> 01:02:35.752 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK WE GOT A VERY

01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:39.022 region:rollup2
HONEST.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:40.557 region:rollup2
AN OPEN CONVERSATION WITH THEM.

01:02:39.022 --> 01:02:42.392 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY WHAT WE DID IS WE

01:02:40.557 --> 01:02:44.427 region:rollup2
GENERATED A. A PROGRAMMING

01:02:42.392 --> 01:02:45.762 region:rollup2
DOCUMENT WHICH ALL ALSO TALK

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:47.197 region:rollup2
ABOUT LATER ON HERE.

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:49.666 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A SPREADSHEET OF

01:02:47.197 --> 01:02:51.768 region:rollup2
DESIRED ROOMS IN SIZES.

01:02:49.666 --> 01:02:52.035 region:rollup2
AND EVENTUALLY HERE AS I SAID WE

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:52.936 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED.

01:02:52.035 --> 01:02:54.471 region:rollup2
.

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:57.107 region:rollup2
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS.

IS THAT YOU WOULD REMOVE AND

01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:04.381 region:rollup2
REPLACE THE EXISTING CAPITAL

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:05.448 region:rollup2
ANNEX.

01:03:04.381 --> 01:03:08.018 region:rollup2
IT STRUCK THE NEW APPROPRIATELY

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:09.285 region:rollup2
SIZED.

01:03:08.018 --> 01:03:11.821 region:rollup2
ENERGY EFFICIENT CAPITAL ANNEX

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:13.056 region:rollup2
IN THE SAME LOCATION.

01:03:11.821 --> 01:03:14.524 region:rollup2
OUR ASSUMPTIONS ARE WITH THAT

01:03:13.056 --> 01:03:16.459 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION THAT YOU WE

01:03:14.524 --> 01:03:18.428 region:rollup2
COMPLY WITH ALL MODERN CODES.

ALL ACCESSIBILITY NEEDS.

01:03:18.428 --> 01:03:21.298 region:rollup2
AND BE VERY INCLUSIVE IN THE

01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:23.233 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:24.567 region:rollup2
SO AT THIS POINT.

01:03:23.233 --> 01:03:26.369 region:rollup2
TIRED HEAR ME TALK ABOUT PASSES

01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:28.004 region:rollup2
ON TO MARK YOUR WHO IS GOING TO

01:03:26.369 --> 01:03:29.673 region:rollup2
WALK YOU THROUGH THE EXISTING

01:03:28.004 --> 01:03:30.874 region:rollup2
BUILDING DEFICIENCIES AND THEN

01:03:29.673 --> 01:03:34.344 region:rollup2
PROGRESSED TO.

01:03:30.874 --> 01:03:37.213 region:rollup2
CASA GRADUATION.

01:03:34.344 --> 01:03:38.615 region:rollup2
THANKS JOHN.

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:39.316 region:rollup2
THIS SLIDE THAT SHOWN IS FROM

01:03:38.615 --> 01:03:41.318 region:rollup2
PAGE TEN

01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:42.419 region:rollup2
THE PLANNING BOOK.

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:43.720 region:rollup2
AND OUR PRESENTATION THIS

01:03:42.419 --> 01:03:44.721 region:rollup2
MORNING IS BASED ON THE BOOK AND

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:46.690 region:rollup2
SO IS JOHN MENTIONED WE WILL

01:03:44.721 --> 01:03:48.291 region:rollup2
OCCASIONALLY SHOW SLIDES DIRECT

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:49.893 region:rollup2
FROM THE BOOK JUST ORIENT YOU AS

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:51.661 region:rollup2
WE GO ALONG.

01:03:49.893 --> 01:03:52.529 region:rollup2
IN ON THIS ON THIS PAGE THERE'S

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.863 region:rollup2
A.

01:03:52.529 --> 01:03:55.899 region:rollup2
TWELVE.

01:03:53.863 --> 01:03:57.767 region:rollup2
.

01:03:55.899 --> 01:03:59.569 region:rollup2
TWELVE DEFICIENCIES ARE TWELVE

01:03:57.767 --> 01:04:00.170 region:rollup2
GENERAL CATEGORIES FOR DEFEAT

01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:01.438 region:rollup2
SEES THAT WE FOUND WITHIN THE

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:02.972 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

01:04:01.438 --> 01:04:03.940 region:rollup2
AND GETTING ALL THE DEFICIENCIES

01:04:02.972 --> 01:04:06.009 region:rollup2
LUMPED INTO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:07.077 region:rollup2
IS A BIT OF A CHALLENGE.

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:08.845 region:rollup2
REALLY WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR

01:04:07.077 --> 01:04:11.047 region:rollup2
HERE'S DEFICIENCIES.

01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:13.016 region:rollup2
BUT LIMIT THE ROLE OF THE ANNEX

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:14.818 region:rollup2
FULLY ACHIEVING ITS.

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:17.053 region:rollup2
ROLE AS A VENUE.

01:04:14.818 --> 01:04:18.788 region:rollup2
FOR GOVERNMENTAL PROCESSES BUT

01:04:17.053 --> 01:04:20.323 region:rollup2
ALSO FOR ALLOWING FOR FOR.

01:04:18.788 --> 01:04:20.890 region:rollup2
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION SO THOSE

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:22.959 region:rollup2
WERE OUR FOCUS FOR BUILDING

01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:24.260 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT.

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:25.228 region:rollup2
IT WILL GO THROUGH THESE

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.162 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALLY NOW BUT THEY'RE

01:04:25.228 --> 01:04:29.132 region:rollup2
LOCATED ON PAGES TEN TO THIRTY

01:04:26.162 --> 01:04:31.000 region:rollup2
OF THE BOOK.

01:04:29.132 --> 01:04:32.369 region:rollup2
FIRST ONE LIFE SAFETY BUILDING

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.971 region:rollup2
CODE DEFICIENCIES WE MENTION

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:35.905 region:rollup2
THIS BEFORE. AND AND PRIMARILY

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:38.074 region:rollup2
TO THE AGE OF THE ANNEX THERE

01:04:35.905 --> 01:04:38.942 region:rollup2
ARE SIGNIFICANT LIFE SAFETY

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:40.376 region:rollup2
DEFICIENCIES THAT EXIST WITHIN

01:04:38.942 --> 01:04:41.644 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING.

01:04:40.376 --> 01:04:43.446 region:rollup2
AND JUST TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW.

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:44.547 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO EXITS

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:46.182 region:rollup2
IT'S WHAT WE MEAN BY THAT IS

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:47.650 region:rollup2
REALLY THE THE ABILITY FOR AND

01:04:46.182 --> 01:04:49.285 region:rollup2
IN INDIVIDUAL WHO WORKS IN THE

01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:50.954 region:rollup2
BUILDING OR A GUEST TO GET TO

01:04:49.285 --> 01:04:52.055 region:rollup2
THAT EXIT.

01:04:50.954 --> 01:04:53.923 region:rollup2
BUT ALONG THE WAY THERE'S GOING

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:54.491 region:rollup2
TO BE EXIT WITH IMPACT

01:04:53.923 --> 01:04:56.593 region:rollup2
IMPAIRMENTS AND WE SEE EXIT

01:04:54.491 --> 01:04:57.427 region:rollup2
WITS.

01:04:56.593 --> 01:04:58.762 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S OF

01:04:57.427 --> 01:05:00.130 region:rollup2
HALLWAYS BUT WERE ALSO TALK

01:04:58.762 --> 01:05:02.232 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT THE DOORWAYS AT A

01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:03.833 region:rollup2
SPACES AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:04.934 region:rollup2
WHAT'S OF STAIRWAYS SO IT'S IT

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:06.336 region:rollup2
IMPACTS THE HORIZONTAL

01:05:04.934 --> 01:05:07.804 region:rollup2
CIRCULATION AS WELL AS THE

01:05:06.336 --> 01:05:10.273 region:rollup2
VERTICAL CIRCULATION.

01:05:07.804 --> 01:05:11.708 region:rollup2
NOT ENOUGH WITH SIMPLY PUT.

01:05:10.273 --> 01:05:13.109 region:rollup2
AS MENTIONED BEFORE THE FIRE

01:05:11.708 --> 01:05:14.310 region:rollup2
SPRINKLER SYSTEM IS NOT

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:16.112 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE THROUGHOUT THE

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:17.680 region:rollup2
BUILDING IT THERE IS A LIMITED

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:18.648 region:rollup2
AMOUNT DOWN IN THAT IN SOME

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:20.350 region:rollup2
PARTS OF THE BASEMENT IS WHERE

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:23.086 region:rollup2
THAT DOES EXIST.

01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:25.355 region:rollup2
AND IF AND ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A.

01:05:23.086 --> 01:05:27.190 region:rollup2
CHO DEFICIENCY IS IF THE IF THE

01:05:25.355 --> 01:05:28.691 region:rollup2
BUILDING WAS BUILT TODAY IF THIS

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:30.460 region:rollup2
ANNEX WAS BUILT UNDERSEA MODERN

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:31.961 region:rollup2
BUILDING CODES IT WOULD HAVE

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:33.430 region:rollup2
MORE LATERAL BRACING MORE

01:05:31.961 --> 01:05:35.064 region:rollup2
SEISMIC BRACING EARTHQUAKE

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:35.698 region:rollup2
EARTHQUAKE BRACING.

01:05:35.064 --> 01:05:37.500 region:rollup2
DID WHAT THIS BUILDING CURRENTLY

01:05:35.698 --> 01:05:39.202 region:rollup2
HAS.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:40.003 region:rollup2
THE SECOND ONE IS NON COMPLIANCE

01:05:39.202 --> 01:05:41.070 region:rollup2
WITH THE AMERICANS WITH

01:05:40.003 --> 01:05:42.639 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES ACT THE EIGHTY

01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:44.340 region:rollup2
EIGHT.

01:05:42.639 --> 01:05:46.309 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE IN

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:47.844 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN LARGELY DUE TO THE AGE

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:49.946 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING. AND AND BUT THESE

01:05:47.844 --> 01:05:51.347 region:rollup2
ARE PROBLEMS THAT IMPACT THOSE

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:53.349 region:rollup2
WHO WORK IN THE BUILDING. BUT

01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:55.452 region:rollup2
ALSO IMPACT.

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:56.085 region:rollup2
ACCESS FOR THE PUBLIC TO GET

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:56.920 region:rollup2
INTO THE BUILDING IN TO MEET

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:58.688 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR MEET WITH THEIR

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:00.123 region:rollup2
LAWMAKERS.

01:05:58.688 --> 01:06:01.691 region:rollup2
SO REALLY ALL PAP O. PUBLIC

01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:02.792 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THIS

01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:04.160 region:rollup2
BUILDING THIS MOST IMPORTANT

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:05.461 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S HOUSE AND IN THE

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.529 region:rollup2
BUILDING SHOULD NOT LIMIT.

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:09.632 region:rollup2
IN IN SOME CAPACITY

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:11.367 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IT DOES.

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:14.103 region:rollup2
THE SPECIFIC SPECIFICS OF THAT

01:06:11.367 --> 01:06:15.605 region:rollup2
ACCESS OR FOR WORK SPACES.

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:16.072 region:rollup2
MEETING AREAS AND TOILET

01:06:15.605 --> 01:06:18.274 region:rollup2
FACILITIES THE TOILET

01:06:16.072 --> 01:06:19.542 region:rollup2
FACILITIES.

01:06:18.274 --> 01:06:20.977 region:rollup2
IS I'M SURE IS GENERALLY KNOWN

01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:21.778 region:rollup2
ARE THERE'S TOO FEW OF THEM AND

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:24.614 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE IN THEIR THEIR TOO

01:06:21.778 --> 01:06:27.050 region:rollup2
SMALL SO JUST ACCESS TO THOSE.

01:06:24.614 --> 01:06:27.317 region:rollup2
IS DIFFERENT IMPEDIMENT.

01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:29.452 region:rollup2
ONE OTHER.

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:31.454 region:rollup2
.

01:06:29.452 --> 01:06:33.022 region:rollup2
SLIGHTLY MORE DETAILED ITEM IS.

01:06:31.454 --> 01:06:34.724 region:rollup2
IN IN HERE IN A ROOM SUCH AS

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:36.459 region:rollup2
THIS THERE'S WAYS TO HAVE A

01:06:34.724 --> 01:06:38.928 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT BETTER ENHANCEMENTS

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:40.964 region:rollup2
FOR IMPROVED ASSISTED LISTENING.

01:06:38.928 --> 01:06:42.665 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE VOTE

01:06:40.964 --> 01:06:44.901 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC WHO COMES IN AND AND

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:46.503 region:rollup2
MAYBE HEARING IMPAIRED.

01:06:44.901 --> 01:06:48.238 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE DESIGN ISSUES IS

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:50.273 region:rollup2
ANOTHER DEFICIENCY THAT WE

01:06:48.238 --> 01:06:52.408 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED IN JUST REAL SIMPLY

01:06:50.273 --> 01:06:54.510 region:rollup2
PUT THE EXISTING. ANNEXES NOT

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:55.678 region:rollup2
ENERGY EFFICIENT.

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:57.313 region:rollup2
THE I THIS BUILDING SHOULD

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:59.148 region:rollup2
STRIVE TO BE A NET ZERO. ENERGY

01:06:57.313 --> 01:07:01.351 region:rollup2
FACILITY.

01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:01.985 region:rollup2
EXISTING ENVELOPE AND EXISTING

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:03.086 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS WITHIN THE BUILDING JUST

01:07:01.985 --> 01:07:05.388 region:rollup2
DON'T.

01:07:03.086 --> 01:07:06.556 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN.

01:07:05.388 --> 01:07:08.258 region:rollup2
ANOTHER FOSTER A COUPLE OF THE

01:07:06.556 --> 01:07:08.825 region:rollup2
FAUCETS OF SUSTAINABLE DESIGN

01:07:08.258 --> 01:07:11.194 region:rollup2
THOUGH IS.

01:07:08.825 --> 01:07:12.528 region:rollup2
MATERIAL ON SYSTEM SELECTION

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:14.530 region:rollup2
IN A SUSTAINABLE BUILDING THAT

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:15.965 region:rollup2
MATERIALS SHOULD BE LONG LASTING

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:17.667 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE TIMELESS EASILY

01:07:15.965 --> 01:07:18.935 region:rollup2
MAINTAINED.

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:20.270 region:rollup2
AND REDUCE GLOBAL GLOBAL WARMING

01:07:18.935 --> 01:07:21.604 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL.

01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:23.706 region:rollup2
AND CURRENTLY NOT ALL THE

01:07:21.604 --> 01:07:25.642 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS IN AND FINISHES IN THIS

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:27.176 region:rollup2
BUILDING MEET THAT CRITERIA.

01:07:25.642 --> 01:07:28.411 region:rollup2
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST IDEALLY

01:07:27.176 --> 01:07:29.946 region:rollup2
IN ASSISTING WILL DESIGN

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:31.514 region:rollup2
BUILDING HERE A BUILDING WITH

01:07:29.946 --> 01:07:33.283 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE DESIGN YOU HAVE.

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:35.084 region:rollup2
FIXTURES THAT ARE LOW WATER USE

01:07:33.283 --> 01:07:36.152 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SINKS

01:07:35.084 --> 01:07:38.321 region:rollup2
WERE TALKING ABOUT TOILETS MORE

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:40.390 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT URINALS.

01:07:38.321 --> 01:07:41.357 region:rollup2
OVERCROWDING IS IS OUR FOURTH

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:42.559 region:rollup2
DEFICIENCY IN THIS IS A

01:07:41.357 --> 01:07:44.694 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT ONE AND WE HEARD

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:45.862 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS.

01:07:44.694 --> 01:07:46.963 region:rollup2
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT DURING OUR

01:07:45.862 --> 01:07:48.431 region:rollup2
INTERVIEWS BUT WE'VE ALSO

01:07:46.963 --> 01:07:49.499 region:rollup2
OBSERVED IT FIRST HAND THAT

01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:51.434 region:rollup2
PROBABLY EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM

01:07:49.499 --> 01:07:53.469 region:rollup2
IS OBSERVED THIS FIRST HAND.

01:07:51.434 --> 01:07:54.470 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY DURING THAT DURING

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:56.606 region:rollup2
SESSION OF COURSE BUT THERE'S

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:58.308 region:rollup2
CONGESTION IN THE HALLWAYS BUT

01:07:56.606 --> 01:08:00.543 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO CONGESTION IN THE

01:07:58.308 --> 01:08:01.811 region:rollup2
BACK WORK AREAS THAT A LOT OF

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:03.379 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC MAY NOT EXPERIENCE OR

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:05.748 region:rollup2
SEE.

01:08:03.379 --> 01:08:07.784 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE'S CODE IMPACTS

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:10.386 region:rollup2
TO THIS OVERCROWDING.

01:08:07.784 --> 01:08:11.554 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO THE THE OVERCROWDING

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:13.289 region:rollup2
CREATES BUILDING OR CREATES

01:08:11.554 --> 01:08:15.591 region:rollup2
BUSINESS INEFFICIENT.

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:17.093 region:rollup2
THE. THIS ENGINE DOESN'T CHURN

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:18.595 region:rollup2
QUITE AS WELL AS IT COULD IF IT

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:20.163 region:rollup2
HAD A LITTLE MORE SPACE A LITTLE

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:21.731 region:rollup2
MORE.

01:08:20.163 --> 01:08:23.633 region:rollup2
MORE ROOMS MORE MEETING ROOMS

01:08:21.731 --> 01:08:24.567 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY.

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:26.069 region:rollup2
AND OVERCROWDING THOUGH DOES IT

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:28.438 region:rollup2
IN

01:08:26.069 --> 01:08:29.339 region:rollup2
TO US LIMIT THE PUBLIC'S ABILITY

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:31.507 region:rollup2
TO COME IN AND.

01:08:29.339 --> 01:08:32.342 region:rollup2
ME WITH THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS

01:08:31.507 --> 01:08:34.610 region:rollup2
OR PERHAPS TESTIFIED A PUBLIC

01:08:32.342 --> 01:08:37.246 region:rollup2
HEARING.

01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:39.282 region:rollup2
NEXT IMAGE PLEASE.

01:08:37.246 --> 01:08:40.550 region:rollup2
A SAFETY OF USER CONCERNS THAT

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:42.685 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:44.320 region:rollup2
HERE IS SECURITY FOR THE

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:45.788 region:rollup2
BUILDING OCCUPANCY GAS.

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:47.123 region:rollup2
AND WE DID DURING OUR INTERVIEWS

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:49.359 region:rollup2
HAVE DISCUSSIONS LIKE THE

01:08:47.123 --> 01:08:50.693 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS ON SECURITY.

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:52.161 region:rollup2
AT THAT DO NEED TO BE ADDRESSED

01:08:50.693 --> 01:08:53.863 region:rollup2
BUT THEY BASICALLY FALL INTO TWO

01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:56.065 region:rollup2
GENERAL CATEGORIES.

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:57.700 region:rollup2
ENHANCING TECHNOLOGY.

01:08:56.065 --> 01:08:59.902 region:rollup2
THE SECURITY SYSTEM SHOULD BE

01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:00.937 region:rollup2
STATE OF THE ART SIMPLY PUT.

01:08:59.902 --> 01:09:02.338 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO THERE'S SOME PHYSICAL

01:09:00.937 --> 01:09:03.306 region:rollup2
ENHANCEMENTS

01:09:02.338 --> 01:09:03.773 region:rollup2
COULD BE DONE TO THE BUILDING

01:09:03.306 --> 01:09:04.974 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THESE ARE

01:09:03.773 --> 01:09:06.509 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:08.344 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE TAKING THE PARKING

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:10.046 region:rollup2
THAT'S CURRENTLY. UNDERNEATH THE

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:11.614 region:rollup2
BUILDING FOOTPRINTS AND MOVING

01:09:10.046 --> 01:09:12.915 region:rollup2
THAT OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THE

01:09:11.614 --> 01:09:14.617 region:rollup2
BUILDING FOOTPRINT THAT'S A A

01:09:12.915 --> 01:09:15.151 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL RESTRAINT RIGHT NOW TO

01:09:14.617 --> 01:09:17.553 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING THAT COULD BE

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:19.022 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED.

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:20.923 region:rollup2
CONFUSING WAY FINDING AND PUBLIC

01:09:19.022 --> 01:09:22.892 region:rollup2
ACCESS AND THESE ISSUES START

01:09:20.923 --> 01:09:23.760 region:rollup2
WITH THE SITE.

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:24.360 region:rollup2
WHEN PEOPLE APPROACH THE

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.728 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:27.530 region:rollup2
I THINK A LOT OF FIRST TIME

01:09:25.728 --> 01:09:29.265 region:rollup2
USERS THEY WANNA GRAVITATE

01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:30.600 region:rollup2
TOWARD THE STORK WEST WING. IS A

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:32.268 region:rollup2
APPROACH THIS THEY REALIZED TO

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.437 region:rollup2
GET IN THEY NEED TO GO OVER TO.

01:09:32.268 --> 01:09:35.972 region:rollup2
A LITTLE DIFFERENT AREA FOR

01:09:34.437 --> 01:09:37.774 region:rollup2
THOSE TO GAIN ENTRY TO THE

01:09:35.972 --> 01:09:39.242 region:rollup2
SECURITY CHECKPOINTS.

01:09:37.774 --> 01:09:40.209 region:rollup2
AND THIS CREATES CONGESTION IF

01:09:39.242 --> 01:09:41.511 region:rollup2
THOSE CHECKPOINTS AND

01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:43.479 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THAT ON THE

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:45.448 region:rollup2
NORTH SIDE THERE'S THE.

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:46.783 region:rollup2
THE COUNTY DISPLAYSTHAT

01:09:45.448 --> 01:09:48.351 region:rollup2
CREATES A BOTTLENECK IMMEDIATELY

01:09:46.783 --> 01:09:50.286 region:rollup2
AFTER ENTRY.

01:09:48.351 --> 01:09:51.888 region:rollup2
BUT INTERNAL CIRCULATION ONCE

01:09:50.286 --> 01:09:53.990 region:rollup2
THEY'RE IN THE BUILDING THERE IS

01:09:51.888 --> 01:09:56.559 region:rollup2
THAT CONFUSION IN A LOT OF THIS

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:57.593 region:rollup2
IS THE SIZE OF THE BUILDING.

01:09:56.559 --> 01:09:58.895 region:rollup2
INHERENT IN THE NATURE OF

01:09:57.593 --> 01:10:00.630 region:rollup2
BUILDING THE SIZE IN ITS

01:09:58.895 --> 01:10:02.532 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WEST WING

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:03.099 region:rollup2
THE THE DIFFERENCES IN ELEVATION

01:10:02.532 --> 01:10:04.367 region:rollup2
BUT JUST THE THE SIZE OF THE

01:10:03.099 --> 01:10:05.001 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:05.635 region:rollup2
SO THAT WAY FINDING IS AN ISSUE

01:10:05.001 --> 01:10:08.738 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD BE

01:10:05.635 --> 01:10:10.506 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ADDRESSED.

01:10:08.738 --> 01:10:10.973 region:rollup2
FEELING TOILET AND PLUMBING

01:10:10.506 --> 01:10:12.875 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS.

01:10:10.973 --> 01:10:14.844 region:rollup2
I MITCHELL BEFORE THERE'S

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:16.846 region:rollup2
INSUFFICIENT TOILET ROOMS.

01:10:14.844 --> 01:10:17.647 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO DRINKING FOUNTAINS THEY

01:10:16.846 --> 01:10:19.382 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE BOTTLED WATER

01:10:17.647 --> 01:10:21.150 region:rollup2
FILLERS IDEALLY ON THEM. AND WE

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:21.717 region:rollup2
USE THE TERM FAILING TOILET

01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:22.785 region:rollup2
THERE BECAUSE WERE AWARE OF

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:23.753 region:rollup2
SOME.

01:10:22.785 --> 01:10:24.787 region:rollup2
FEELING PIPES THAT HAVE

01:10:23.753 --> 01:10:26.689 region:rollup2
LITERALLY BURST THERE'S BEEN

01:10:24.787 --> 01:10:27.924 region:rollup2
SOME LEAKS THERE'S BEEN SOME

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:30.159 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS IN THE BUILDING BETTER.

01:10:27.924 --> 01:10:32.295 region:rollup2
LOCALLY ON ONE FLOOR BUT ALSO

01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:33.563 region:rollup2
IMPACTED THE FLOOR BELOW.

01:10:32.295 --> 01:10:34.964 region:rollup2
AT LEAST AGING MECHANICAL

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:36.466 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS AND DURING THE

01:10:34.964 --> 01:10:37.600 region:rollup2
INTERVIEWS WE WE HEARD A GREAT

01:10:36.466 --> 01:10:39.235 region:rollup2
DEAL ABOUT PROBLEMS WITH THERMAL

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:40.570 region:rollup2
COMFORT.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:47.009 region:rollup2
AND A D. G. S. DID GET

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:48.611 region:rollup2
COMPLIMENTED ON THEIR WRISTS.

01:10:47.009 --> 01:10:54.383 region:rollup2
IT'S PROBLEMS.

01:10:48.611 --> 01:10:55.718 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOOD.

01:10:54.383 --> 01:10:57.120 region:rollup2
A AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST WITH

01:10:55.718 --> 01:10:58.287 region:rollup2
THE AGEING MECHANICAL SYSTEMS

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:02.391 region:rollup2
ARE JUST SIMPLY NOT ENERGY

01:10:58.287 --> 01:11:03.493 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT.

01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:05.762 region:rollup2
UNDERSIZED ELECTRICAL

01:11:03.493 --> 01:11:07.597 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE WE DID ANALYZE

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:09.465 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING AMPERAGE INTO THE

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:09.999 region:rollup2
BUILDING THE.

01:11:09.465 --> 01:11:12.368 region:rollup2
WHAT COOL JUICE INTO THE

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:14.103 region:rollup2
BUILDING AND FOUND IT TO BE

01:11:12.368 --> 01:11:15.838 region:rollup2
UNDERSIZED IN OUR REPORT IT'S IN

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:18.508 region:rollup2
THE REPORTED IT'S IDENTIFIED

01:11:15.838 --> 01:11:20.076 region:rollup2
THERE AND MORE? THE TECHNICAL

01:11:18.508 --> 01:11:21.577 region:rollup2
ASPECTS OF THAT BUT IT IS LOW.

01:11:20.076 --> 01:11:22.078 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO THE POWER DISTRIBUTION

01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:24.247 region:rollup2
WITH IN THE BUILDING IS

01:11:22.078 --> 01:11:25.948 region:rollup2
OUTDATED.

01:11:24.247 --> 01:11:27.650 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE IF THERE

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:29.085 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE A REPAIR DONE IN THE

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:30.453 region:rollup2
BUILDING IT APPEARS TO US THAT A

01:11:29.085 --> 01:11:31.687 region:rollup2
LARGE CHUNK OF THE BUILDING

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:33.656 region:rollup2
MIGHT NEED TO BE TAKEN OFF LINE

01:11:31.687 --> 01:11:34.791 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT REPAIR. IS OPPOSED TO

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:36.759 region:rollup2
A MORE ADVANCED.

01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:38.094 region:rollup2
OR SOME MODERN ELECTRICAL

01:11:36.759 --> 01:11:39.428 region:rollup2
BACKBONE THAT WOULD ENABLE A

01:11:38.094 --> 01:11:41.197 region:rollup2
LITTLE BUT MORE NIMBLE AND

01:11:39.428 --> 01:11:43.533 region:rollup2
TACTICAL ABILITIES TO DO SMALL

01:11:41.197 --> 01:11:44.934 region:rollup2
REMODELS UPGRADES IS THEY NEED

01:11:43.533 --> 01:11:46.102 region:rollup2
IS A NEED TO BE DONE.

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:48.237 region:rollup2
COINCIDENTALLY WITH THAT

01:11:46.102 --> 01:11:49.505 region:rollup2
OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY.

01:11:48.237 --> 01:11:52.375 region:rollup2
IS THE BUILDING HAS GROWN IN

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:53.810 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IS GROWN. THE ACT.

01:11:52.375 --> 01:11:55.611 region:rollup2
A COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS WITHIN

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:57.213 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING AND TO THE OUTSIDE

01:11:55.611 --> 01:11:58.781 region:rollup2
OF THE BUILDING ARE. THERE PUT

01:11:57.213 --> 01:12:00.750 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY COULD FIT.

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:02.618 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS MEET CODE.

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:04.520 region:rollup2
IN IT CLOSETS ARE NOT DENTED

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:06.556 region:rollup2
NOTE HAVE A SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:09.125 region:rollup2
THE TECHNO TECHNOLOGICAL

01:12:06.556 --> 01:12:10.860 region:rollup2
ADVANCEMENTS THAT COULD HAPPEN.

01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:13.095 region:rollup2
INADEQUATE CONFERENCING SPACES

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:14.197 region:rollup2
THIS IS THIS IS A HUGE ONE AND.

01:12:13.095 --> 01:12:16.165 region:rollup2
IT'S A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WITH

01:12:14.197 --> 01:12:17.333 region:rollup2
IN THE ANNEX.

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:19.869 region:rollup2
THERE SHOULD BE MORE FORMAL

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:21.604 region:rollup2
HEARING ROOMS.

01:12:19.869 --> 01:12:24.373 region:rollup2
IN A VARIETY OF SIZES

01:12:21.604 --> 01:12:26.242 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO MORE INFORMAL SPACES.

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:27.810 region:rollup2
IN THE INFORMAL SPACES OR OUR

01:12:26.242 --> 01:12:29.612 region:rollup2
SOME OF WHAT THE PUBLIC DOESN'T

01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:31.013 region:rollup2
SEE BUT WHAT WE'VE OBSERVED IS.

01:12:29.612 --> 01:12:33.049 region:rollup2
IF THERE NEEDS TO BE MEETINGS

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:34.016 region:rollup2
HELD WITHIN WORKERS WHO WORK AT

01:12:33.049 --> 01:12:35.751 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO WORK IN THE BUILDING

01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:37.553 region:rollup2
THERE'S JUST SIMPLY NO. GOOD

01:12:35.751 --> 01:12:40.122 region:rollup2
PLACE FOR THEM TO DO THAT.

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:40.923 region:rollup2
AND ALSO THOUGH THAT LIMITS THE

01:12:40.122 --> 01:12:41.958 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO THE PUBLIC TO COME

01:12:40.923 --> 01:12:43.459 region:rollup2
AND NOW WE'VE HEARD NUMEROUS

01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:45.094 region:rollup2
TIMES OF.

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:46.028 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC COMES IN THERE'S NO

01:12:45.094 --> 01:12:46.229 region:rollup2
GOOD THEY WANT TO MEET WITH

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:47.597 region:rollup2
THEIR.

01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:48.431 region:rollup2
.

01:12:47.597 --> 01:12:49.999 region:rollup2
MEET WITH SOMEONE THERE'S NO

01:12:48.431 --> 01:12:51.667 region:rollup2
GOOD PLACE TO DO THAT THOSE CAN

01:12:49.999 --> 01:12:54.203 region:rollup2
SPELL OUT INTO THE HALLWAY. AND

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:55.504 region:rollup2
NOT AN IDEAL SITUATION.

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:56.706 region:rollup2
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST OTHER

01:12:55.504 --> 01:12:58.374 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AND WORKING SPACE

01:12:56.706 --> 01:12:59.876 region:rollup2
DEFICIENCIES.

01:12:58.374 --> 01:13:00.810 region:rollup2
OF THE WHAT'S ON THE SLIDE THERE

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:02.545 region:rollup2
HAS.

01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:04.080 region:rollup2
A NUMBER OF THOSE ON THE LIST

01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:06.282 region:rollup2
GOT PRIMARILY THOSE MISALIGNED

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:07.450 region:rollup2
FLOORS IS ONE THAT I THINK

01:13:06.282 --> 01:13:08.751 region:rollup2
IMPACTS THE THE FUNCTION OF THE

01:13:07.450 --> 01:13:10.219 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

01:13:08.751 --> 01:13:12.555 region:rollup2
AND THE ALSO THOUGH AMENITIES

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:14.156 region:rollup2
FOR WORKERS FOR ENHANCING THEIR

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:18.027 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO DO THEIR JOBS IN AN

01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:18.928 region:rollup2
EXPEDITIOUS WAY.

01:13:18.027 --> 01:13:20.830 region:rollup2
NEXT UP.

01:13:18.928 --> 01:13:22.798 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO TALK.

01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:25.034 region:rollup2
ABOUT ESTIMATED.

01:13:22.798 --> 01:13:27.136 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTION COSTS.

01:13:25.034 --> 01:13:28.804 region:rollup2
AND ON THE NEXT SLIDE. IN THIS

01:13:27.136 --> 01:13:30.239 region:rollup2
IS FROM PAGE EIGHTY.

01:13:28.804 --> 01:13:32.475 region:rollup2
OF THE PLANNING STUDY BOOK THERE

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:34.443 region:rollup2
WERE THREE.

01:13:32.475 --> 01:13:35.645 region:rollup2
COST EVALUATIONS DONE. THE FIRST

01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:37.046 region:rollup2
IS REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT OF

01:13:35.645 --> 01:13:38.281 region:rollup2
THE ANNEX

01:13:37.046 --> 01:13:39.982 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ONE IS NEW PARKING

01:13:38.281 --> 01:13:41.384 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE.

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:43.119 region:rollup2
IN A NEW VISITOR CENTER AND

01:13:41.384 --> 01:13:44.587 region:rollup2
PUBLIC ACCESS THOSE OF THE THREE

01:13:43.119 --> 01:13:45.655 region:rollup2
COSTS YOU SEE HERE IN THOSE AND

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:47.523 region:rollup2
WE DID THESE THREE SEPARATE

01:13:45.655 --> 01:13:48.991 region:rollup2
COSTS BECAUSE THEY REALLY NEEDED

01:13:47.523 --> 01:13:50.159 region:rollup2
TO BE EVALUATED DIFFERENTLY.

01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:51.327 region:rollup2
FROM ONE ANOTHER AND WE WANTED

01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:53.796 region:rollup2
TO BUDGET AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT

01:13:51.327 --> 01:13:55.197 region:rollup2
FOR EACH ITEM.

01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:58.234 region:rollup2
SO MOVING INTO THE REMOVAL AND

01:13:55.197 --> 01:14:00.403 region:rollup2
REPLACEMENT OF THE ANNEX.

01:13:58.234 --> 01:14:01.404 region:rollup2
THE EVALUATION WAS DONE.

01:14:00.403 --> 01:14:02.171 region:rollup2
PRICING OF AN APPROPRIATELY

01:14:01.404 --> 01:14:04.473 region:rollup2
SIZED.

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:06.375 region:rollup2
NEW ANNEX.

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:08.344 region:rollup2
OUR VALUATION WAS DONE ASSUMING

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:09.111 region:rollup2
THAT NEW ANNEX WOULD BE VACATED.

01:14:08.344 --> 01:14:11.080 region:rollup2
AND THE CONSTRUCTION WOULD BE

01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:13.049 region:rollup2
DONE ALL AT ONCE.

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:14.684 region:rollup2
AND IT IS JOHN MENTIONED EARLY

01:14:13.049 --> 01:14:16.452 region:rollup2
EARLIER JOHN ALLUDED TO ITS ITS

01:14:14.684 --> 01:14:17.954 region:rollup2
MOST EFFICIENT TO DO IT THAT WAY

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:19.956 region:rollup2
WITH WE FEEL ITS MOST EFFICIENT

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:21.123 region:rollup2
FOR THE GOVERNMENT. TO MAINTAIN

01:14:19.956 --> 01:14:22.091 region:rollup2
ITS PROCESSES

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:23.592 region:rollup2
FOR THE BUILDING TO BE

01:14:22.091 --> 01:14:25.127 region:rollup2
HOLISTICALLY DONE AT ONCE. BUT

01:14:23.592 --> 01:14:26.762 region:rollup2
ALSO FROM ITS CONSTRUCTION

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:28.798 region:rollup2
STANDPOINT IT'S MOST EFFICIENT

01:14:26.762 --> 01:14:32.001 region:rollup2
THAT WAY AS WELL TO TRY TO LIMIT

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:33.836 region:rollup2
THE CONSTRUCTION DURATION.

01:14:32.001 --> 01:14:35.371 region:rollup2
SWING SPACES HORSE WILL SPACES

01:14:33.836 --> 01:14:36.706 region:rollup2
FOR RELOCATION THAT JOHN TALKED

01:14:35.371 --> 01:14:38.641 region:rollup2
ABOUT ARE ARE NOT IN THE

01:14:36.706 --> 01:14:40.009 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE. IN THERE'S THERE'S

01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:41.544 region:rollup2
THREE DIFFERENT VEHICLES FOR

01:14:40.009 --> 01:14:42.778 region:rollup2
ACHIEVING THOSE SWING SPACES

01:14:41.544 --> 01:14:43.713 region:rollup2
WHERE WHERE THE WHERE THE

01:14:42.778 --> 01:14:45.114 region:rollup2
BUSINESS NEEDS TO HAPPEN DURING

01:14:43.713 --> 01:14:46.949 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION.

01:14:45.114 --> 01:14:48.851 region:rollup2
AND IT COULD BE NEW CONSTRUCTION

01:14:46.949 --> 01:14:49.985 region:rollup2
COULD BE BUILT NEW NEW SQUARE

01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:52.321 region:rollup2
FOOTAGE COULD BE PROVIDED FOR

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:53.956 region:rollup2
THAT OR IT COULD BE. A EXISTING

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:55.524 region:rollup2
SPACE BE REMODELED WERE THIRD

01:14:53.956 --> 01:14:58.027 region:rollup2
COULD BE.

01:14:55.524 --> 01:14:59.395 region:rollup2
RENTAL RENTING EXISTING SPACES

01:14:58.027 --> 01:15:01.564 region:rollup2
AND AND BASED ON OUR PAST

01:14:59.395 --> 01:15:02.498 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE RENTING IS USUALLY

01:15:01.564 --> 01:15:04.066 region:rollup2
THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:05.601 region:rollup2
GO. BUT THERE MAY BE SOME

01:15:04.066 --> 01:15:07.036 region:rollup2
COMBINATION DEPENDING ON

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:09.038 region:rollup2
AVAILABILITY OUT THERE THAT

01:15:07.036 --> 01:15:10.639 region:rollup2
WOULD DETERMINE THOSE IMPACTS IN

01:15:09.038 --> 01:15:11.240 region:rollup2
THOSE THOSE PRICES.

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:12.341 region:rollup2
SO THAT WOULD BE A STUDY THAT

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:15.011 region:rollup2
WOULD NEED TO BE.

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:17.313 region:rollup2
IT WOULD NEED TO BE DONE.

01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:18.347 region:rollup2
OUR BUDGET CONSTRUCTION COST.

01:15:17.313 --> 01:15:20.082 region:rollup2
FOR REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT

01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:23.786 region:rollup2
ANNEXES APPROXIMATELY FIVE

01:15:20.082 --> 01:15:26.021 region:rollup2
HUNDRED SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS.

01:15:23.786 --> 01:15:28.190 region:rollup2
ON THE NEW PARKING STRUCTURE ON

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:30.860 region:rollup2
THE SLIDE OUR EVALUATION

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:32.395 region:rollup2
INCLUDED REMOVAL OF THE PARKING.

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:33.729 region:rollup2
FROM UNDERNEATH THE BUILDING AND

01:15:32.395 --> 01:15:34.430 region:rollup2
PROVIDING A NEW PARKING

01:15:33.729 --> 01:15:36.365 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE SEPARATE FROM THE

01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:38.434 region:rollup2
ANNEX.

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:39.835 region:rollup2
IN THE SIZE OF THIS WAS DONE BY

01:15:38.434 --> 01:15:40.936 region:rollup2
OUR INTERVIEWS ARE OURS DURING

01:15:39.835 --> 01:15:42.471 region:rollup2
THE INTERVIEW PROCESS TO

01:15:40.936 --> 01:15:44.473 region:rollup2
DETERMINE THE SIZE OF THAT. BUT

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:46.242 region:rollup2
ALSO INCLUDES LOADING DOCK AND

01:15:44.473 --> 01:15:49.111 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PARKING AREA.

01:15:46.242 --> 01:15:50.046 region:rollup2
IF IT IF IT REMAINS ON SITE.

01:15:49.111 --> 01:15:51.313 region:rollup2
IT PROBABLY SHOULD BE

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:51.480 region:rollup2
UNDERGROUND.

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:53.549 region:rollup2
TO.

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:55.284 region:rollup2
.

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:56.886 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN VIEWS TO THE CAPITOL TO

01:15:55.284 --> 01:15:59.388 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN THE CHARACTER. OF THE

01:15:56.886 --> 01:16:00.623 region:rollup2
CAPITOL MALL. IT IT DOESN'T HAVE

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:01.857 region:rollup2
TO BE UNDERGROUND OR IT DOESN'T

01:16:00.623 --> 01:16:03.426 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE.

01:16:01.857 --> 01:16:06.662 region:rollup2
ON SITE IT COULD BE IN SOME

01:16:03.426 --> 01:16:07.763 region:rollup2
ADJACENT LOT ARE ARE ARE COST IS

01:16:06.662 --> 01:16:09.365 region:rollup2
IT SO ASSUMING IT TO BE

01:16:07.763 --> 01:16:11.867 region:rollup2
UNDERGROUND ADJACENT TO THE

01:16:09.365 --> 01:16:13.636 region:rollup2
CAPITAL. AND WE HAVE SOME ROUGH.

01:16:11.867 --> 01:16:15.171 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATION STUDIES OF THIS

01:16:13.636 --> 01:16:17.706 region:rollup2
BUT HAVEN'T DONE ANY GREAT OUT

01:16:15.171 --> 01:16:18.974 region:rollup2
WAIT TO SEE WHERE IT WOULD FIT.

01:16:17.706 --> 01:16:20.342 region:rollup2
A BUDGET COST BUDGET

01:16:18.974 --> 01:16:23.546 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION COST OF THIS SIX

01:16:20.342 --> 01:16:25.614 region:rollup2
AND A HALF MILLION.

01:16:23.546 --> 01:16:28.384 region:rollup2
IN LAST PUBLIC ACCESS VISITORS

01:16:25.614 --> 01:16:29.819 region:rollup2
CENTER FOR THE FIFTY PLUS YEAR

01:16:28.384 --> 01:16:31.987 region:rollup2
LIFESPAN OF THE BUILDING.

01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:34.023 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE PUBLIC

01:16:31.987 --> 01:16:35.925 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO PRIORITY.

01:16:34.023 --> 01:16:37.760 region:rollup2
AND THESE COSTS ADDRESS SITE IS

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:39.295 region:rollup2
THE APPROACH TO THE SITE.

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:41.096 region:rollup2
ACUITY ENTRIES BUT ALSO AREAS

01:16:39.295 --> 01:16:43.766 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE ANNEX.

01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:44.967 region:rollup2
DO COST TO INCLUDE OUR PREFER

01:16:43.766 --> 01:16:46.735 region:rollup2
PROVIDING FOR A NEW VISITOR

01:16:44.967 --> 01:16:47.903 region:rollup2
CENTER. FOR THE PUBLIC.

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:49.638 region:rollup2
AND THIS WOULD BE REALLY AN

01:16:47.903 --> 01:16:51.106 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:52.708 region:rollup2
VISITOR EXPERIENCE IS THEY

01:16:51.106 --> 01:16:53.843 region:rollup2
APPROACHED THE CAPITAL.

01:16:52.708 --> 01:16:55.478 region:rollup2
A COULD FUNNEL THEM INTO THE

01:16:53.843 --> 01:16:56.879 region:rollup2
WEST WING WHERE A GREAT DEAL OF

01:16:55.478 --> 01:16:59.315 region:rollup2
THEM WANT TO GO.

01:16:56.879 --> 01:17:01.317 region:rollup2
THERE'S INTERACTIVE DISPLAYS

01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:02.852 region:rollup2
THAT COULD EARLY BE STAGED IN

01:17:01.317 --> 01:17:04.086 region:rollup2
THAT PROCESS EVEN AS EARLY AS

01:17:02.852 --> 01:17:05.521 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE SCREENING PROCESS

01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:06.956 region:rollup2
FOR THAT GROUP.

01:17:05.521 --> 01:17:09.658 region:rollup2
TO GO THROUGH SO THE EXPERIENCES

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:10.826 region:rollup2
IS A A A GOOD ONE FOR THEM.

01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:11.794 region:rollup2
AND THAT WOULD FREE UP SOME

01:17:10.826 --> 01:17:12.695 region:rollup2
TRAFFIC IT SOME OF THE OTHER

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:15.164 region:rollup2
WORKADAY.

01:17:12.695 --> 01:17:16.866 region:rollup2
ENTRANCES.

01:17:15.164 --> 01:17:18.467 region:rollup2
ALSO THOUGH IN THIS IN THIS

01:17:16.866 --> 01:17:20.202 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS WE LOOKED IT SQUARE

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:22.304 region:rollup2
FOOTAGE WITHIN THE ANNEX FOR

01:17:20.202 --> 01:17:24.340 region:rollup2
WIDER CIRCULATION AREAS.

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:26.408 region:rollup2
PACIFIC WE AREAS WHERE LAWMAKERS

01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:28.144 region:rollup2
CAN MEET WITH THEIR CONSTITUENTS

01:17:26.408 --> 01:17:28.711 region:rollup2
WE WANT WE WANT TO HAVE THOSE

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:30.179 region:rollup2
THAT THE APPROPRIATE SQUARE

01:17:28.711 --> 01:17:32.047 region:rollup2
FOOTAGE.

01:17:30.179 --> 01:17:35.351 region:rollup2
IN THE CIRCULATION SYSTEM SO

01:17:32.047 --> 01:17:36.418 region:rollup2
THAT PUBLIC ACCESS IS GRANTED.

01:17:35.351 --> 01:17:38.387 region:rollup2
OUR BUDGET COST BUDGET

01:17:36.418 --> 01:17:40.222 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION COST FOR PUBLIC

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:41.123 region:rollup2
ACCESS VISITORS CENTER.

01:17:40.222 --> 01:17:44.393 region:rollup2
IS APPROXIMATELY THIRTY MILLION

01:17:41.123 --> 01:17:46.195 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

01:17:44.393 --> 01:17:47.963 region:rollup2
DANIEL WILL TALK NEXT.

01:17:46.195 --> 01:17:50.566 region:rollup2
ABOUT DESIGN GOALS ITS ALTERNATE

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:52.801 region:rollup2
OVER TO HER.

01:17:50.566 --> 01:17:55.204 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MARK.

01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:56.672 region:rollup2
THE NINETEEN DESIGN GOALS FOR

01:17:55.204 --> 01:17:58.274 region:rollup2
THIS PROJECT CAN BE FOUND ON

01:17:56.672 --> 01:18:00.276 region:rollup2
PAGES THIRTY EIGHT TO SIXTY FOUR

01:17:58.274 --> 01:18:03.078 region:rollup2
IN YOUR BOOKS.

01:18:00.276 --> 01:18:04.813 region:rollup2
LEAST GOALS FOR RETIREMENT TO

01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:06.382 region:rollup2
BE THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEAS OF

01:18:04.813 --> 01:18:07.883 region:rollup2
THE PROJECT.

01:18:06.382 --> 01:18:09.718 region:rollup2
I WILL PROVIDE THE FUTURE DESIGN

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:11.687 region:rollup2
TEAM WITH GUIDANCE THROUGHOUT

01:18:09.718 --> 01:18:13.222 region:rollup2
THE DESIGN PROCESS.

01:18:11.687 --> 01:18:14.924 region:rollup2
THE GOALS EMERGED FROM

01:18:13.222 --> 01:18:16.191 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER WORK SESSIONS AND

01:18:14.924 --> 01:18:17.660 region:rollup2
INTERVIEWS THAT JOHN MENTIONED

01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:18.894 region:rollup2
EARLIER.

01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:20.229 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

01:18:18.894 --> 01:18:22.231 region:rollup2
WE RUN THROUGH THESE DESIGN

01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:25.301 region:rollup2
GOALS SO THAT EVERYBODY CAN COME

01:18:22.231 --> 01:18:26.402 region:rollup2
BECOME MORE FAMILIAR WITH THEM.

01:18:25.301 --> 01:18:29.371 region:rollup2
THE FIRST DESIGN GOAL IS

01:18:26.402 --> 01:18:31.040 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY AND OPENNESS.

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:33.275 region:rollup2
MAINTAINING TRANSPARENCY AND

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:34.944 region:rollup2
OPENNESS IS IMPORTANT.

01:18:33.275 --> 01:18:36.812 region:rollup2
OVER TIME WE'VE HAD THE

01:18:34.944 --> 01:18:38.314 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVE NUMEROUS

01:18:36.812 --> 01:18:40.149 region:rollup2
STATE GOVERNMENTS AN OPTION IN

01:18:38.314 --> 01:18:42.384 region:rollup2
OPERATION.

01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:44.486 region:rollup2
BUT MOST ARE NOT AS ENGAGING AS

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:46.255 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:48.224 region:rollup2
THE INTENT OF THE NEW DESIGN IS

01:18:46.255 --> 01:18:50.226 region:rollup2
TO ENHANCE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION

01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:51.927 region:rollup2
IN THE GOVERNMENTAL PROCESS. AND

01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:53.362 region:rollup2
REMOTE ACCESS TO MEMBERS BY

01:18:51.927 --> 01:18:55.397 region:rollup2
REORGANIZING THE OFFICES AND

01:18:53.362 --> 01:18:56.498 region:rollup2
CONFERENCE ROOMS AND PROVIDING

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:59.401 region:rollup2
CLEAR PATHWAYS AROUND THE

01:18:56.498 --> 01:19:03.339 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:04.673 region:rollup2
CIVIC ENGAGEMENT.

01:19:03.339 --> 01:19:06.208 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE PUBLIC

01:19:04.673 --> 01:19:08.110 region:rollup2
FEEL COMFORTABLE WHEN VISITING

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:10.479 region:rollup2
THE CAPITOL AND PARTICIPATING IN

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:13.048 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNMENTAL PROCESS.

01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:14.850 region:rollup2
SOME EXISTING PHYSICAL BARRIERS

01:19:13.048 --> 01:19:15.884 region:rollup2
HINDER THIS ENGAGEMENT

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:17.920 region:rollup2
SUCH AS INADEQUATELY SIZE

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:19.188 region:rollup2
CONFERENCE ROOMS.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.123 region:rollup2
THE NEW DESIGN TO PROVIDE

01:19:19.188 --> 01:19:23.225 region:rollup2
INVITING SPACES TO PARTICIPATING

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:26.262 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS AND

01:19:23.225 --> 01:19:29.999 region:rollup2
SHOWCASE THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE.

01:19:26.262 --> 01:19:31.767 region:rollup2
DIGNITY.

01:19:29.999 --> 01:19:33.802 region:rollup2
DIGNITY AND GOVERNMENT FOSTERS

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:35.371 region:rollup2
PRIDE IN CALL TRY DANITY.

01:19:33.802 --> 01:19:36.972 region:rollup2
EVERYONE WHO WORKS AND AND

01:19:35.371 --> 01:19:38.574 region:rollup2
VISITS CAPITAL SHOULD FEEL A

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:40.542 region:rollup2
SENSE OF DIGNITY DIGNITY AND

01:19:38.574 --> 01:19:41.910 region:rollup2
PRIDE FROM THE TIME THEY ENTERED

01:19:40.542 --> 01:19:43.646 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING UNTIL THE EXIT THE

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:45.414 region:rollup2
CAPITOL GROUNDS.

01:19:43.646 --> 01:19:48.017 region:rollup2
THE ANNEX DESIGN CHAU PROVIDE A

01:19:45.414 --> 01:19:50.452 region:rollup2
QUALITY EXPERIENCE FOR ALL USERS

01:19:48.017 --> 01:19:51.820 region:rollup2
BY INSTILLING DIGNITY AND PRIDE.

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:52.855 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS BY PROVIDING A

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:58.160 region:rollup2
CONNECTION TO CALIFORNIA'S

01:19:52.855 --> 01:20:00.863 region:rollup2
CULTURE AND HISTORY.

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:02.364 region:rollup2
ENTRY IN THE VISITOR EXPERIENCE.

01:20:00.863 --> 01:20:03.799 region:rollup2
AS YOU ALTHOUGH THE CAPITAL

01:20:02.364 --> 01:20:05.401 region:rollup2
HOSTS APPROXIMATELY ONE AND A

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:07.403 region:rollup2
HALF TO TWO MILLION VISITORS A

01:20:05.401 --> 01:20:13.075 region:rollup2
YEAR. INCLUDING TENS OF

01:20:07.403 --> 01:20:15.311 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF SCHOOL CHILDREN.

01:20:13.075 --> 01:20:17.112 region:rollup2
.

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:18.681 region:rollup2
THIS LEADS TO VERY CONGESTED

01:20:17.112 --> 01:20:20.049 region:rollup2
ENTRYWAYS AND HALLWAYS AT THE

01:20:18.681 --> 01:20:21.917 region:rollup2
COUNTY DISPLAYS WHICH WE'VE ALL

01:20:20.049 --> 01:20:23.319 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED.

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:24.987 region:rollup2
THE NEW DESIGN WILL PROVIDE THE

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:26.555 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO DEDICATE AN AREA

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:28.157 region:rollup2
FOR GUESTS AND SCHOOL CHILDREN

01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:30.159 region:rollup2
TOGETHER FOR A MORE MEANINGFUL

01:20:28.157 --> 01:20:31.860 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE.

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:32.928 region:rollup2
THIS DEDICATED AREA SHOULD

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:35.264 region:rollup2
ENGAGE THE GUESTS WITH

01:20:32.928 --> 01:20:37.132 region:rollup2
INTERACTIVE DISPLAYS AND BE ABLE

01:20:35.264 --> 01:20:38.434 region:rollup2
TO ACCOMMODATE LARGE CROWDS.

01:20:37.132 --> 01:20:40.436 region:rollup2
THERE SHOULD ALSO BE CLEAR

01:20:38.434 --> 01:20:40.969 region:rollup2
DIRECT ROUTES FOR THOSE WISHING

01:20:40.436 --> 01:20:42.805 region:rollup2
TO DO BUSINESS WITH IN THE

01:20:40.969 --> 01:20:46.108 region:rollup2
CAPITAL.

01:20:42.805 --> 01:20:47.810 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONALITY.

01:20:46.108 --> 01:20:49.378 region:rollup2
A FUNCTIONAL DESIGN WILL ENABLE

01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:50.412 region:rollup2
USERS TO EFFICIENTLY A

01:20:49.378 --> 01:20:52.581 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLY CARRY OUT THEIR

01:20:50.412 --> 01:20:54.283 region:rollup2
DAILY ACTIVITIES.

01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:55.718 region:rollup2
IS NOT PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE TO

01:20:54.283 --> 01:20:58.053 region:rollup2
RENOVATE THE CURRENT BUILDING TO

01:20:55.718 --> 01:21:00.456 region:rollup2
FUNCTION AS DESIRED DO ITS SIZE

01:20:58.053 --> 01:21:02.424 region:rollup2
AND STRUCTURAL CONFIGURATION.

01:21:00.456 --> 01:21:03.425 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR

01:21:02.424 --> 01:21:04.927 region:rollup2
INTERVIEWS WITH USERS THAT MANY

01:21:03.425 --> 01:21:07.029 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS OCCUR IN THE

01:21:04.927 --> 01:21:08.731 region:rollup2
CORRIDORS. LACK TO.

01:21:07.029 --> 01:21:10.099 region:rollup2
DUE TO LACK OF INADEQUATE

01:21:08.731 --> 01:21:11.500 region:rollup2
MEETING SPACES.

01:21:10.099 --> 01:21:13.068 region:rollup2
IT COMPOUNDS THE CONGESTION IN

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:14.937 region:rollup2
THE HALLWAYS.

01:21:13.068 --> 01:21:17.172 region:rollup2
THE NEW ANNEX DESIGN SHOULD

01:21:14.937 --> 01:21:18.674 region:rollup2
HOUSE ALL DESIRED FUNCTIONS

01:21:17.172 --> 01:21:19.808 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THESE CASUAL

01:21:18.674 --> 01:21:22.277 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION SPOTS IN THE

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:25.347 region:rollup2
CORRIDORS.

01:21:22.277 --> 01:21:26.648 region:rollup2
THE NEXT GOAL IS HIERARCHY.

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:28.150 region:rollup2
HIGHER KEY OF SIGNS ACCORDANCE

01:21:26.648 --> 01:21:30.252 region:rollup2
TO AREAS OF BUILDING THROUGH

01:21:28.150 --> 01:21:32.354 region:rollup2
SHEEP SIZE LOCATION AND LEVEL OF

01:21:30.252 --> 01:21:34.523 region:rollup2
FINISH.

01:21:32.354 --> 01:21:36.258 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLES OF HIGHER KEY EVIDENT

01:21:34.523 --> 01:21:37.559 region:rollup2
IN THE HISTORIC CAPITAL SHALL BE

01:21:36.258 --> 01:21:39.395 region:rollup2
CARRIED THROUGHOUT THE NEW

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:41.029 region:rollup2
DESIGN OF THE AND.

01:21:39.395 --> 01:21:43.132 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY AS YOU MOVE BETWEEN

01:21:41.029 --> 01:21:46.068 region:rollup2
THE TWO BUILDINGS.

01:21:43.132 --> 01:21:47.503 region:rollup2
EVIDENT THAT THE ANNEX WHO WAS

01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:48.003 region:rollup2
NOT COORDINATED ALL ON THE

01:21:47.503 --> 01:21:51.507 region:rollup2
DESIGN WITH THE HISTORIC

01:21:48.003 --> 01:21:52.574 region:rollup2
CAPITAL.

01:21:51.507 --> 01:21:54.543 region:rollup2
HISTORIC CONNECTION AND

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:55.811 region:rollup2
RELEVANCY.

01:21:54.543 --> 01:21:57.246 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY THERE'S VERY LITTLE

01:21:55.811 --> 01:21:59.081 region:rollup2
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE HISTORIC

01:21:57.246 --> 01:22:00.883 region:rollup2
CAPITAL IN THE ANNEX.

01:21:59.081 --> 01:22:02.284 region:rollup2
THE MISALIGNMENT OF THE FLOORS

01:22:00.883 --> 01:22:03.685 region:rollup2
IS MARK DISCUSSED.

01:22:02.284 --> 01:22:05.621 region:rollup2
AND THE SEMI INSTITUTIONAL

01:22:03.685 --> 01:22:07.623 region:rollup2
FINISHES OF THE ANNEX GIVE IT OF

01:22:05.621 --> 01:22:09.324 region:rollup2
DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT FEEL.

01:22:07.623 --> 01:22:09.892 region:rollup2
THE GOAL OF THE ANNEX DESIGN

01:22:09.324 --> 01:22:11.126 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE TO STRENGTHEN THE

01:22:09.892 --> 01:22:12.594 region:rollup2
CONNECTION.

01:22:11.126 --> 01:22:14.730 region:rollup2
BETWEEN AN ACCENT HISTORY

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:15.664 region:rollup2
CAPITAL WITHOUT OVERSHADOWING

01:22:14.730 --> 01:22:17.232 region:rollup2
THE STORK RELEVANCY OF THE

01:22:15.664 --> 01:22:18.567 region:rollup2
CAPITAL.

01:22:17.232 --> 01:22:20.936 region:rollup2
THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BY

01:22:18.567 --> 01:22:22.471 region:rollup2
INTRODUCING SIMILAR MATERIALS

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:23.739 region:rollup2
AND SYMBOLISM THAT IS CURRENTLY

01:22:22.471 --> 01:22:26.074 region:rollup2
FOUND THROUGHOUT THIS STORY

01:22:23.739 --> 01:22:28.243 region:rollup2
CAPITOL. ONE OF THE SYMBOLS IS

01:22:26.074 --> 01:22:30.445 region:rollup2
THE CARVED WOULD BEAR THAT YOU

01:22:28.243 --> 01:22:32.548 region:rollup2
SEE IN THE PICTURE HERE.

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:34.550 region:rollup2
NEXT SLIDE.

01:22:32.548 --> 01:22:36.785 region:rollup2
NATURAL LIGHTEN VIEWS WE HEARD

01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:38.353 region:rollup2
FROM ALMOST EVERY STAKEHOLDER

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:39.721 region:rollup2
THAT NATURAL LIGHTING VIEWS ARE

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:42.024 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE

01:22:39.721 --> 01:22:44.126 region:rollup2
DESIGN OF THE ANNEX.

01:22:42.024 --> 01:22:45.127 region:rollup2
THE NEW DESIGN CHAU USE NATURAL

01:22:44.126 --> 01:22:47.596 region:rollup2
LIGHT THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING

01:22:45.127 --> 01:22:49.131 region:rollup2
TOMORROW HEALTH AND WELL BEING.

01:22:47.596 --> 01:22:50.833 region:rollup2
THE USE OF NATURAL LIGHT ALSO

01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:52.734 region:rollup2
REDUCES THE NEED FOR ARTIFICIAL

01:22:50.833 --> 01:22:55.971 region:rollup2
LIGHT. REDUCING ENERGY

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:58.240 region:rollup2
CONSUMPTION AND COSTS.

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:59.641 region:rollup2
LIFE SAFETY.

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:00.943 region:rollup2
AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED THE ANNEX

01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:02.311 region:rollup2
DOES NOT COMPLY WITH CURRENT

01:23:00.943 --> 01:23:04.513 region:rollup2
BUILDING CODES.

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:05.814 region:rollup2
IN PARTICULAR.

01:23:04.513 --> 01:23:07.850 region:rollup2
IT'S LACKING A FIRE SPRINKLER

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:10.185 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND HAS INSUFFICIENT

01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:11.753 region:rollup2
EXITING OUT OF THE BUILDING.

01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:13.689 region:rollup2
FIRST BANQUET SYSTEM SAVE BOTH

01:23:11.753 --> 01:23:15.757 region:rollup2
AYE BUILDING OCCUPANTS AND

01:23:13.689 --> 01:23:17.459 region:rollup2
FIREFIGHTERS LIVES.

01:23:15.757 --> 01:23:18.460 region:rollup2
THEY CAN ALSO LIMIT DAMAGE TO

01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:20.362 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS STRUCTURES DURING A

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:21.797 region:rollup2
FIRE.

01:23:20.362 --> 01:23:23.332 region:rollup2
THE NEW ANNEX DESIGN SHOULD BE

01:23:21.797 --> 01:23:25.434 region:rollup2
DESIGNED TO MEET OR EXCEED ALL

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:26.535 region:rollup2
BUILDING CODES.

01:23:25.434 --> 01:23:28.003 region:rollup2
IT WILL PROVIDE A SAFE

01:23:26.535 --> 01:23:29.137 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL USERS

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:30.506 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THOSE WORKING IN THE

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:31.740 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

01:23:30.506 --> 01:23:36.612 region:rollup2
TWO GROUPS VISITORS AND SCHOOL

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:41.917 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

01:23:36.612 --> 01:23:43.418 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBILITY.

01:23:41.917 --> 01:23:45.654 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBILITY MEANS PROVIDING

01:23:43.418 --> 01:23:47.456 region:rollup2
EQUAL ACCESS FOR ALL USERS

01:23:45.654 --> 01:23:48.724 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF ABILITY.

01:23:47.456 --> 01:23:50.692 region:rollup2
SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE

01:23:48.724 --> 01:23:53.362 region:rollup2
AMERICAN WITH DISABILITIES ACT

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:54.463 region:rollup2
EIGHTY A. IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:56.431 region:rollup2
THE BILLING HAS UNDERGONE

01:23:54.463 --> 01:23:57.833 region:rollup2
NUMEROUS RENOVATIONS TO IMPROVE

01:23:56.431 --> 01:23:59.735 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBILITY.

01:23:57.833 --> 01:24:01.737 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IT IS NOT BEEN ABLE TO

01:23:59.735 --> 01:24:03.272 region:rollup2
BE BROUGHT FULLY AT TO THE ADA

01:24:01.737 --> 01:24:06.074 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA TITLE TWENTY FOUR

01:24:03.272 --> 01:24:07.976 region:rollup2
STANDARDS. AS THE LAW REQUIRES

01:24:06.074 --> 01:24:09.611 region:rollup2
DUE TO MANY BARRIERS WITHIN THE

01:24:07.976 --> 01:24:10.979 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

01:24:09.611 --> 01:24:11.547 region:rollup2
THE NEW ANNEX DESIGNED SHOULD BE

01:24:10.979 --> 01:24:20.088 region:rollup2
FULLY ACCESSIBLE AND PROMOTE

01:24:11.547 --> 01:24:22.291 region:rollup2

01:24:36.038 --> 01:24:39.508 region:rollup2
LIFT THAT SEEN IN THIS PICTURE

01:24:37.573 --> 01:24:40.275 region:rollup2
HERE'S ONE OF THOSE THAT WE

01:24:39.508 --> 01:24:42.811 region:rollup2
WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO GET RID

01:24:40.275 --> 01:24:45.447 region:rollup2
OF. AND PROVIDE ACCESS TO ALL

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:46.782 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT OUT OF THE WAY AND

01:24:45.447 --> 01:24:49.017 region:rollup2
INCONVENIENT AS THIS WITH

01:24:46.782 --> 01:24:51.987 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IS.

01:24:49.017 --> 01:24:53.889 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE DESIGN.

01:24:51.987 --> 01:24:55.624 region:rollup2
IT IS BEEN STATED THAT THE ANNEX

01:24:53.889 --> 01:24:57.426 region:rollup2
SHOW SET AN EXAMPLE FOR ENERGY

01:24:55.624 --> 01:24:59.461 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY AND BE AMONGST THE

01:24:57.426 --> 01:25:01.897 region:rollup2
MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT CAPITALS

01:24:59.461 --> 01:25:04.199 region:rollup2
IN THE UNITED STATES.

01:25:01.897 --> 01:25:06.001 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE DESIGN NOT ONLY

01:25:04.199 --> 01:25:07.336 region:rollup2
REFERS TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY BUT

01:25:06.001 --> 01:25:09.504 region:rollup2
ALSO EXTENDS TO BUILDING

01:25:07.336 --> 01:25:12.441 region:rollup2
MATERIALS DELIGHT WASTE THE

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:15.010 region:rollup2
BUILDING SITE. TECHNOLOGY AND

01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:17.679 region:rollup2
ALL OTHER BUILDING SYSTEMS.

01:25:15.010 --> 01:25:19.081 region:rollup2
THE GOAL WOULD BE A MINIMUM OF A

01:25:17.679 --> 01:25:21.984 region:rollup2
LEAD SILVER CERTIFICATION ON THE

01:25:19.081 --> 01:25:23.986 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

01:25:21.984 --> 01:25:25.620 region:rollup2
THE NEW ANNEX DESIGN SHOW ALSO

01:25:23.986 --> 01:25:27.489 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE HIM IMPLEMENT.

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:30.025 region:rollup2
AS IN MANY SUSTAINABLE DESIGN

01:25:27.489 --> 01:25:32.394 region:rollup2
MEASURES AS FEASIBLY POSSIBLE.

01:25:30.025 --> 01:25:34.129 region:rollup2
INCLUDING EXPLORING THE USE OF

01:25:32.394 --> 01:25:38.533 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE ENERGY CONSUMPTION.

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:40.736 region:rollup2
SYSTEM SUCH AS SOLAR PANELS.

01:25:38.533 --> 01:25:41.970 region:rollup2
SAFETY OF USERS.

01:25:40.736 --> 01:25:43.639 region:rollup2
MAINTAINING THE SAFETY AND

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:45.374 region:rollup2
SECURITY OF BUILDING USERS IS

01:25:43.639 --> 01:25:48.043 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

01:25:45.374 --> 01:25:49.111 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING FROM BUILDING ACCESS

01:25:48.043 --> 01:25:50.712 region:rollup2
AND EXITING TO PARKING A FIRE

01:25:49.111 --> 01:25:52.481 region:rollup2
SPRINKLER SHOULD BE CONSIDERED

01:25:50.712 --> 01:25:53.749 region:rollup2
IN THE NEW DESIGN.

01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:55.684 region:rollup2
OVER TIME THE BILLING HAS HAD TO

01:25:53.749 --> 01:25:57.686 region:rollup2
ADAPT TO MORE STRINGENT SECURITY

01:25:55.684 --> 01:25:58.220 region:rollup2
MEASURES SUCH AS THE SECURITY

01:25:57.686 --> 01:26:01.189 region:rollup2
PAVILION SEEN HERE. IN THE

01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:02.724 region:rollup2
PHOTO.

01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:04.292 region:rollup2
THE NEW AN ACTUAL BE DESIGNED TO

01:26:02.724 --> 01:26:05.761 region:rollup2
INTEGRATE CURRENT SECURITY

01:26:04.292 --> 01:26:08.030 region:rollup2
MEASURES WITHIN THE DESIGN OF

01:26:05.761 --> 01:26:10.298 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING HAVE BE FLEXIBLE TO

01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:12.267 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATE FUTURE MEASURES.

01:26:10.298 --> 01:26:14.269 region:rollup2
WHY ME?

01:26:12.267 --> 01:26:14.736 region:rollup2
SURE ON.

01:26:14.269 --> 01:26:16.438 region:rollup2
THERE'S A NEW FEDERAL

01:26:14.736 --> 01:26:17.372 region:rollup2
COURTHOUSE.

01:26:16.438 --> 01:26:19.541 region:rollup2
NEW FEDERAL COURTHOUSE IN

01:26:17.372 --> 01:26:19.975 region:rollup2
DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES.

01:26:19.541 --> 01:26:24.913 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:26:19.975 --> 01:26:26.481 region:rollup2
IN SEPTEMBER. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN.

01:26:24.913 --> 01:26:28.483 region:rollup2
ARE LIKE THREE WEEKS MORE OPEN

01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:29.384 region:rollup2
THE DEPUTY US MARSHAL GAVE ME A

01:26:28.483 --> 01:26:31.153 region:rollup2
TOUR OF THIS NEW.

01:26:29.384 --> 01:26:32.320 region:rollup2
NEW FEDERAL COURTHOUSE.

01:26:31.153 --> 01:26:32.888 region:rollup2
AND THE THING THAT STRUCK ME WAS

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:35.357 region:rollup2
HE SAID.

01:26:32.888 --> 01:26:36.892 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:26:35.357 --> 01:26:38.460 region:rollup2
HE WAS IN THE ROOM ON BEHALF OF

01:26:36.892 --> 01:26:39.961 region:rollup2
THE U. S. MARSHALL LOS ANGELES

01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:41.663 region:rollup2
COUNTY ON THAT DAY EVERYONE

01:26:39.961 --> 01:26:42.564 region:rollup2
FIRST FILED IN THE ROOM.

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:44.099 region:rollup2
TO START A CONVERSATION OR NEW

01:26:42.564 --> 01:26:46.334 region:rollup2
COURTHOUSE.

01:26:44.099 --> 01:26:48.136 region:rollup2
AND SO HE HE JUST EXPRESS THIS

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:49.371 region:rollup2
IDEA THAT. IF YOU GET YOUR

01:26:48.136 --> 01:26:50.939 region:rollup2
SECURITY TEAM IN THE

01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:52.274 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION EARLY.

01:26:50.939 --> 01:26:54.009 region:rollup2
THEN YOU ARE ABLE TO HAVE A.

01:26:52.274 --> 01:26:57.079 region:rollup2
EIGHT.

01:26:54.009 --> 01:26:58.080 region:rollup2
REAL STRONG THREE SIXTY VIEW OF.

01:26:57.079 --> 01:26:59.915 region:rollup2
HOW TO MAKE THE SECURITY THING

01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:01.783 region:rollup2
WORK SECURELY?

01:26:59.915 --> 01:27:02.617 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN INTEGRATED IN THE%

01:27:01.783 --> 01:27:03.919 region:rollup2
DESIGN AND THAT'S THE MOST

01:27:02.617 --> 01:27:05.087 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE WAY TO GO.

01:27:03.919 --> 01:27:06.688 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHY LAST YEAR WE HAD

01:27:05.087 --> 01:27:08.957 region:rollup2
OUR.

01:27:06.688 --> 01:27:10.559 region:rollup2
DENNIS CAPTAINCIES PR OWN

01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:12.394 region:rollup2
SERGEANTS IN THE CONVERSATION.

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:14.062 region:rollup2
SO THIS BECOMES A VERY IMPORTANT

01:27:12.394 --> 01:27:16.431 region:rollup2
THING TO DO EARLY BECAUSE IS SO

01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:17.065 region:rollup2
SO NEEDED TODAY AND IT BECOMES

01:27:16.431 --> 01:27:20.435 region:rollup2
MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO START TO

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:21.703 region:rollup2
COME.

01:27:20.435 --> 01:27:23.004 region:rollup2
GREAT THINK YOU AND THAT'S

01:27:21.703 --> 01:27:25.073 region:rollup2
REALLY INDICATIVE OF THE ENTIRE

01:27:23.004 --> 01:27:26.374 region:rollup2
PROCESS WE WOULD WANNA BRING IN.

01:27:25.073 --> 01:27:28.477 region:rollup2
ALL DIFFERENT.

01:27:26.374 --> 01:27:30.378 region:rollup2
ENTITIES SUCH AS SECURITY

01:27:28.477 --> 01:27:31.713 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBILITY AND THE DIFFERENT.

01:27:30.378 --> 01:27:32.881 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE AN

01:27:31.713 --> 01:27:35.083 region:rollup2
INFLUENCE ON THE DESIGN OF THE

01:27:32.881 --> 01:27:36.952 region:rollup2
PROCESS EARLY TO HAVE BEEN A

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:39.654 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL DESIGN.

01:27:36.952 --> 01:27:41.590 region:rollup2
MECHANICAL ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS

01:27:39.654 --> 01:27:42.958 region:rollup2
IS THE NEXT DESIGN GOAL. AS THE

01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:44.659 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE CURRENT

01:27:42.958 --> 01:27:46.261 region:rollup2
MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL

01:27:44.659 --> 01:27:47.863 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS WITHIN THE ANNEX OR

01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:49.898 region:rollup2
INEFFICIENT AND INADEQUATE FOR

01:27:47.863 --> 01:27:51.199 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT BUILDING NEEDS.

01:27:49.898 --> 01:27:53.401 region:rollup2
NEW MECHANICAL ELECTRICAL

01:27:51.199 --> 01:27:54.770 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS ARE NOT ONLY GOOD FOR

01:27:53.401 --> 01:27:56.571 region:rollup2
THE BILLING USERS ARE ALSO GOOD

01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:58.306 region:rollup2
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.

01:27:56.571 --> 01:28:00.208 region:rollup2
THEY PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:27:58.306 --> 01:28:01.743 region:rollup2
REMOVE POTENTIALLY HARMFUL

01:28:00.208 --> 01:28:03.478 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT FROM THE BUILDING AND

01:28:01.743 --> 01:28:05.647 region:rollup2
PROVIDE STATE OF THE ART LOW

01:28:03.478 --> 01:28:07.249 region:rollup2
IMPACT EQUIPMENT.

01:28:05.647 --> 01:28:09.518 region:rollup2
THE NEW AN EXTRA HAVE MODERN

01:28:07.249 --> 01:28:11.386 region:rollup2
ELECTRICAL MECHANICAL SYSTEMS

01:28:09.518 --> 01:28:13.755 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ENERGY EFFICIENT. USE

01:28:11.386 --> 01:28:15.357 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS OF FRESH AIR

01:28:13.755 --> 01:28:18.927 region:rollup2
HAVE USER FRIENDLY CONTROLS AND

01:28:15.357 --> 01:28:21.663 region:rollup2
ARE ADAPTABLE TO FUTURE NEEDS.

01:28:18.927 --> 01:28:23.365 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY.

01:28:21.663 --> 01:28:25.167 region:rollup2
WHEN UNIX WAS CONSTRUCTED THE

01:28:23.365 --> 01:28:26.835 region:rollup2
DESIGNERS COULD NOT SEE OR

01:28:25.167 --> 01:28:28.403 region:rollup2
PREDICT THE ADVANCES IN

01:28:26.835 --> 01:28:30.605 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY AND THE LIFE. OUR

01:28:28.403 --> 01:28:31.973 region:rollup2
LIFETIME WOULD SEE OVER TIME

01:28:30.605 --> 01:28:33.875 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN INTRODUCED

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:36.578 region:rollup2
TO THE BUILDING. BUT IT'S STILL

01:28:33.875 --> 01:28:37.913 region:rollup2
NOT UP TO MODERN STANDARDS.

01:28:36.578 --> 01:28:39.047 region:rollup2
RESIDING IN THE TECH CAPITOL OF

01:28:37.913 --> 01:28:41.016 region:rollup2
THE WORLD WILL PROVIDE THE

01:28:39.047 --> 01:28:42.517 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO TAP INTO THIS

01:28:41.016 --> 01:28:44.286 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE. AND APPLY IT TO

01:28:42.517 --> 01:28:45.754 region:rollup2
FUTURE DESIGN.

01:28:44.286 --> 01:28:47.289 region:rollup2
THE NEW HEADACHES SHOULD BE

01:28:45.754 --> 01:28:49.191 region:rollup2
DESIGNED TO INTEGRATE MODERN

01:28:47.289 --> 01:28:51.726 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY TO ALL SPACES THEY'RE

01:28:49.191 --> 01:28:53.094 region:rollup2
FLEXIBLE DEDICATED PATHWAYS.

01:28:51.726 --> 01:28:55.063 region:rollup2
ALLOWING FOR EASY UPGRADES IN

01:28:53.094 --> 01:28:56.798 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE.

01:28:55.063 --> 01:28:58.133 region:rollup2
A DECENT SEIZE.

01:28:56.798 --> 01:28:59.434 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS THE CHART THAT WAS

01:28:58.133 --> 01:29:01.403 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO.

01:28:59.434 --> 01:29:02.704 region:rollup2
BACK THERE ON THE BOARD.

01:29:01.403 --> 01:29:04.506 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE ANNEXES NINE SHOW

01:29:02.704 --> 01:29:06.007 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THE NEEDS OF ALL

01:29:04.506 --> 01:29:07.275 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS AND FUNCTIONS TO

01:29:06.007 --> 01:29:09.544 region:rollup2
PROVIDE A MORE EFFICIENTLY OUT

01:29:07.275 --> 01:29:10.846 region:rollup2
EVERY USERS. AND MAKE NAVIGATION

01:29:09.544 --> 01:29:12.647 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE BUILDING MORE

01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:14.850 region:rollup2
INTUITIVE FOR VISITORS.

01:29:12.647 --> 01:29:16.251 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA CAPITAL IS UNIQUE

01:29:14.850 --> 01:29:17.719 region:rollup2
IN ITS CURRENT DESIGN AND THAT

01:29:16.251 --> 01:29:19.588 region:rollup2
THE HISTORIC CAPITOL BUILDING

01:29:17.719 --> 01:29:21.489 region:rollup2
WAS EXPANDED UPON IS THE STATE

01:29:19.588 --> 01:29:23.258 region:rollup2
GREW RATHER THAN. BUILDING A

01:29:21.489 --> 01:29:25.193 region:rollup2
SECOND OFFICE BUILDING.

01:29:23.258 --> 01:29:26.027 region:rollup2
THIS ALLOWS ALL ASPECTS OF THE

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:28.029 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT TO WORK CLOSELY

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:29.097 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND HAVE DIRECT ACCESS

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:30.732 region:rollup2
TO THE CHAMBERS AND OTHER

01:29:29.097 --> 01:29:32.334 region:rollup2
CEREMONIAL ROOMS WITHIN THE

01:29:30.732 --> 01:29:33.835 region:rollup2
HISTORY CAPITAL.

01:29:32.334 --> 01:29:35.804 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY THE BUILDING HAS

01:29:33.835 --> 01:29:38.173 region:rollup2
ONCE AGAIN BECOME TOO SMALL TO

01:29:35.804 --> 01:29:39.441 region:rollup2
HOUSE ALL DESIRED FUNCTION.

01:29:38.173 --> 01:29:40.809 region:rollup2
BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:29:39.441 --> 01:29:42.878 region:rollup2
USERS.

01:29:40.809 --> 01:29:44.779 region:rollup2
IT IS DESIRED TO MAINTAIN THIS

01:29:42.878 --> 01:29:46.748 region:rollup2
WORKING ADJACENCY.

01:29:44.779 --> 01:29:48.116 region:rollup2
PRESENCE IN THE BUILDING.

01:29:46.748 --> 01:29:49.918 region:rollup2
BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:29:48.116 --> 01:29:51.453 region:rollup2
USERS THERE IS A DESIRE TO

01:29:49.918 --> 01:29:53.321 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATE GOVERNMENTAL

01:29:51.453 --> 01:29:54.723 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS INTO THE ANTICS.

01:29:53.321 --> 01:29:56.424 region:rollup2
THIS WILL EVERYONE TO HAVE A

01:29:54.723 --> 01:29:57.993 region:rollup2
PRESENCE IN THE BUILDING AND

01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:58.994 region:rollup2
REDUCE TRAVEL TIME BETWEEN THE

01:29:57.993 --> 01:30:01.229 region:rollup2
VARIOUS BUILDINGS THAT ARE

01:29:58.994 --> 01:30:04.366 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY USE.

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:05.900 region:rollup2
MEETING SPACES.

01:30:04.366 --> 01:30:07.802 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY MEETING SPACES ARE

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:09.437 region:rollup2
OFTEN OVERCROWDED.

01:30:07.802 --> 01:30:11.139 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING ALSO LACKS ENOUGH

01:30:09.437 --> 01:30:12.007 region:rollup2
VARYING SIZES A MEETING SPACES

01:30:11.139 --> 01:30:13.808 region:rollup2
INCLUDING INFORMAL CONFERENCE

01:30:12.007 --> 01:30:15.343 region:rollup2
SPACES.

01:30:13.808 --> 01:30:17.178 region:rollup2
UPGRADES TO EXISTING MEETING

01:30:15.343 --> 01:30:18.680 region:rollup2
SPACES AND THE ADDITION OF NEW

01:30:17.178 --> 01:30:20.715 region:rollup2
MEANING SPACES WITHIN THE

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:22.217 region:rollup2
CURRENT ANNEX BUILDING HAS BEEN

01:30:20.715 --> 01:30:23.918 region:rollup2
HINDERED BY THE EXISTING

01:30:22.217 --> 01:30:25.787 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE COLUMN LAYOUT. WHICH

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:27.789 region:rollup2
IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO CREATING

01:30:25.787 --> 01:30:29.391 region:rollup2
LARGE OPEN SPACES.

01:30:27.789 --> 01:30:31.059 region:rollup2
THE NEW DESIGNS OFFER A VARIETY

01:30:29.391 --> 01:30:32.694 region:rollup2
OF MEETING SPACE TYPES AND

01:30:31.059 --> 01:30:36.031 region:rollup2
INCORPORATE MODERN TECHNOLOGY.

01:30:32.694 --> 01:30:37.432 region:rollup2
DISPLAYS.

01:30:36.031 --> 01:30:38.633 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY VISITOR DISPLAYS ARE

01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:40.702 region:rollup2
SPREAD OUT THROUGHOUT THE

01:30:38.633 --> 01:30:42.604 region:rollup2
BUILDING WITH NO DEDICATED

01:30:40.702 --> 01:30:43.905 region:rollup2
CENTERED OR ANTI ONESELF.

01:30:42.604 --> 01:30:45.874 region:rollup2
THE NEW ANNEX DESIGN SHALL

01:30:43.905 --> 01:30:47.509 region:rollup2
STRIVE TO INCORPORATE ENRICHED

01:30:45.874 --> 01:30:49.077 region:rollup2
VISITORS PLAYS TO PROMOTE

01:30:47.509 --> 01:30:50.812 region:rollup2
LEARNING. ABOUT THE STATE AND

01:30:49.077 --> 01:30:52.080 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:53.615 region:rollup2
THE ANNEX DESIGN SHOW ALSO

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:55.016 region:rollup2
CREATE PATHWAYS FOR THOSE

01:30:53.615 --> 01:30:56.718 region:rollup2
WANTING TO EXPERIENCE THE

01:30:55.016 --> 01:30:57.886 region:rollup2
HISTORY OF THE CAPITOL. AND

01:30:56.718 --> 01:30:59.554 region:rollup2
THOSE WANTING TO CONDUCT

01:30:57.886 --> 01:31:00.922 region:rollup2
BUSINESS WITHIN THE CAPITAL TO

01:30:59.554 --> 01:31:03.725 region:rollup2
ALLEVIATE CONGESTION AND

01:31:00.922 --> 01:31:05.994 region:rollup2
CONFUSION.

01:31:03.725 --> 01:31:08.363 region:rollup2
THE LAST GOAL IS CAPITAL PARK

01:31:05.994 --> 01:31:09.731 region:rollup2
AND VIEWS TO THE CAPITAL.

01:31:08.363 --> 01:31:10.966 region:rollup2
THE NEW ANNEX DESIGN CHAU

01:31:09.731 --> 01:31:12.634 region:rollup2
REINFORCED THE HISTORIC

01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:14.069 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF THE SURROUNDING

01:31:12.634 --> 01:31:16.137 region:rollup2
CAPITOL PARK.

01:31:14.069 --> 01:31:17.839 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN DETRACT FROM IT.

01:31:16.137 --> 01:31:19.908 region:rollup2
THE NEW DESIGN CHILL STRIVE TO

01:31:17.839 --> 01:31:22.043 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN VIEWS TO THE HISTORIC

01:31:19.908 --> 01:31:23.812 region:rollup2
CAPITAL. AND PROTECT MEMORIALS

01:31:22.043 --> 01:31:25.814 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE PARK.

01:31:23.812 --> 01:31:27.048 region:rollup2
ANY ADDED STRUCTURES MUST BE

01:31:25.814 --> 01:31:28.783 region:rollup2
SUBSERVIENT TO THIS STORY

01:31:27.048 --> 01:31:30.485 region:rollup2
CAPITAL.

01:31:28.783 --> 01:31:31.953 region:rollup2
TO MAINTAIN THE STATURE IN

01:31:30.485 --> 01:31:35.290 region:rollup2
BEAUTY OF THE GRAND BUILDING AND

01:31:31.953 --> 01:31:36.558 region:rollup2
SURROUNDING PARK.

01:31:35.290 --> 01:31:38.226 region:rollup2
NOW I THINK WE'RE GOING TO MOVE

01:31:36.558 --> 01:31:39.694 region:rollup2
ON TO PROGRAMMING IN WHICH JOHN

01:31:38.226 --> 01:31:46.434 region:rollup2
WILL GIVE YOU A BRIEF OVERVIEW

01:31:39.694 --> 01:31:47.736 region:rollup2
OF THAT PROCESS.

01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:48.536 region:rollup2
WELL DEFINED WHAT PROGRAMMING

01:31:47.736 --> 01:31:50.138 region:rollup2
MEANS.

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:52.073 region:rollup2
BECAUSE PROGRAMMING IS A WORD

01:31:50.138 --> 01:31:53.174 region:rollup2
USED BY ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF

01:31:52.073 --> 01:31:54.642 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES AND.

01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:56.111 region:rollup2
THE A INDUSTRY.

01:31:54.642 --> 01:31:58.747 region:rollup2
PROGRAMMING IS ESSENTIALLY AND

01:31:56.111 --> 01:32:00.949 region:rollup2
EVALUATION OF THE SPACE NEEDS.

01:31:58.747 --> 01:32:02.484 region:rollup2
WITHIN A STRUCTURE.

01:32:00.949 --> 01:32:05.120 region:rollup2
AND THE ADJACENCY IS ASSOCIATED

01:32:02.484 --> 01:32:06.654 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE SPACE MEANS.

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:07.956 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS OF THE

01:32:06.654 --> 01:32:10.425 region:rollup2
ANNEX USERS.

01:32:07.956 --> 01:32:11.893 region:rollup2
.

01:32:10.425 --> 01:32:13.028 region:rollup2
YEAH AND HOW THEY ACTUALLY WORK

01:32:11.893 --> 01:32:15.230 region:rollup2
WITH IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT IS

01:32:13.028 --> 01:32:15.897 region:rollup2
PART OF THE PROGRAMMING PROCESS.

01:32:15.230 --> 01:32:18.333 region:rollup2
THE.

01:32:15.897 --> 01:32:20.001 region:rollup2
ONCE AGAIN THE.

01:32:18.333 --> 01:32:21.770 region:rollup2
DIAGRAM THE SHOWN BACK THERE AS

01:32:20.001 --> 01:32:23.571 region:rollup2
WELL AS ONE DANIEL MENTION IS

01:32:21.770 --> 01:32:25.006 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE END RESULTS OF THAT.

01:32:23.571 --> 01:32:26.174 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS ITSELF NEEDS TO

01:32:25.006 --> 01:32:27.575 region:rollup2
RESOLVE WHO NEEDS TO BE IN THE

01:32:26.174 --> 01:32:28.843 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:29.844 region:rollup2
AND SHOULD BE IN THE BUILDING

01:32:28.843 --> 01:32:31.279 region:rollup2
AND WHO DOESN'T NEED TO BE IN

01:32:29.844 --> 01:32:34.182 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING AND WHO DOESN'T

01:32:31.279 --> 01:32:35.250 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE IN THE BUILDING.

01:32:34.182 --> 01:32:36.785 region:rollup2
OR DOESN'T WANT TO BE IN ITALY.

01:32:35.250 --> 01:32:39.087 region:rollup2
.

01:32:36.785 --> 01:32:40.488 region:rollup2
WE WE.

01:32:39.087 --> 01:32:41.956 region:rollup2
SIX OR THE PROGRAMMING TO FIND

01:32:40.488 --> 01:32:43.358 region:rollup2
OUT HOW MANY SQUARE FEET THE

01:32:41.956 --> 01:32:45.760 region:rollup2
ACTUAL BUILDING.

01:32:43.358 --> 01:32:47.429 region:rollup2
WOULD NEED TO INCORPORATE TO BE

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:49.497 region:rollup2
ABLE TO SATISFY THE.

01:32:47.429 --> 01:32:50.832 region:rollup2
FUTURE OF THE PROJECT IN THE

01:32:49.497 --> 01:32:52.300 region:rollup2
FUTURE NEEDS OF THE PROJECT AND

01:32:50.832 --> 01:32:53.701 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THIS WE'RE TRYING TO

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:54.102 region:rollup2
BE.

01:32:53.701 --> 01:32:55.537 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

01:32:54.102 --> 01:32:56.871 region:rollup2
.

01:32:55.537 --> 01:32:57.872 region:rollup2
INTO THE FUTURE NOT JUST IN WHAT

01:32:56.871 --> 01:33:00.775 region:rollup2
DO YOU NEED TODAY

01:32:57.872 --> 01:33:02.944 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD YOU NEED THE FUTURE.

01:33:00.775 --> 01:33:04.746 region:rollup2
SLIDE.

01:33:02.944 --> 01:33:06.081 region:rollup2
SO.

01:33:04.746 --> 01:33:06.981 region:rollup2
ON THIS SIDE HERE WHAT WE'RE

01:33:06.081 --> 01:33:07.582 region:rollup2
GONNA TALK JUST A LITTLE BIT

01:33:06.981 --> 01:33:09.317 region:rollup2
ABOUT IS.

01:33:07.582 --> 01:33:10.685 region:rollup2
KIND OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE

01:33:09.317 --> 01:33:10.885 region:rollup2
KIND OF PROGRAMMING.

01:33:10.685 --> 01:33:12.420 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:33:10.885 --> 01:33:15.390 region:rollup2
.

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:17.058 region:rollup2
WE PROVIDED.

01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:18.660 region:rollup2
PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WAS A HEAVY

01:33:17.058 --> 01:33:19.394 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD WITH

01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:20.228 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY ABOUT HOW WOULD YOU

01:33:19.394 --> 01:33:21.930 region:rollup2
LIKE TO.

01:33:20.228 --> 01:33:22.997 region:rollup2
ENGAGE THE PUBLIC

01:33:21.930 --> 01:33:24.132 region:rollup2
TO GO TO WHAT SOME OF WHAT

01:33:22.997 --> 01:33:25.433 region:rollup2
DANIEL MENTIONED THAT SOME OF

01:33:24.132 --> 01:33:26.501 region:rollup2
WHAT MARK TALKED ABOUT AS.

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:28.002 region:rollup2
DEFICIENCIES WITHIN THE

01:33:26.501 --> 01:33:30.371 region:rollup2
BUILDING THERE NEEDED TO BE MORE

01:33:28.002 --> 01:33:30.872 region:rollup2
CLEAR AND SPACIOUS AREA FOR THE

01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:32.006 region:rollup2
PUBLIC TO COME INTO THE

01:33:30.872 --> 01:33:33.608 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

01:33:32.006 --> 01:33:36.411 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW THEM TO HAVE THEIR.

01:33:33.608 --> 01:33:38.246 region:rollup2
.

01:33:36.411 --> 01:33:39.380 region:rollup2
USE OF THE BUILDING WITHOUT.

01:33:38.246 --> 01:33:40.915 region:rollup2
BEING DETRIMENTAL TO THE REST OF

01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:41.649 region:rollup2
THE FUNCTIONS IN THERE SO THE

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:43.751 region:rollup2
WAS A HIGHLIGHTED IMPORTANCE.

01:33:41.649 --> 01:33:45.119 region:rollup2
TO GET.

01:33:43.751 --> 01:33:46.287 region:rollup2
PUBLISHED USER AND PUT ON HOW

01:33:45.119 --> 01:33:47.856 region:rollup2
THEY USE BUILDING AND HOW THEY'D

01:33:46.287 --> 01:33:49.257 region:rollup2
LIKE TO USE THE BUILDING AND

01:33:47.856 --> 01:33:50.492 region:rollup2
STATE OF JUST.

01:33:49.257 --> 01:33:51.826 region:rollup2
HAVING US TELL THEM HOW THEY GET

01:33:50.492 --> 01:33:53.394 region:rollup2
TO USE THE BUILDING.

01:33:51.826 --> 01:33:54.829 region:rollup2
PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT SPACES WERE

01:33:53.394 --> 01:33:57.165 region:rollup2
PART OF THE PROGRAMMING EXERCISE

01:33:54.829 --> 01:33:58.666 region:rollup2
WE EVALUATED HOW BIG A SPACES

01:33:57.165 --> 01:34:00.168 region:rollup2
AND HOW MANY SPACES WERE NEEDED.

01:33:58.666 --> 01:34:02.036 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF THAT WAS IN THE

01:34:00.168 --> 01:34:04.806 region:rollup2
WAYS OF MEETING SPACES.

01:34:02.036 --> 01:34:06.741 region:rollup2
I HEARING SPACES AND OTHER.

01:34:04.806 --> 01:34:08.376 region:rollup2
AMENITIES THAT ALLOWED PEOPLE

01:34:06.741 --> 01:34:09.944 region:rollup2
TO ENGAGE IN THEIR GOVERNMENT AS

01:34:08.376 --> 01:34:12.113 region:rollup2
WELL AS JUST VISIT AND HAVE A

01:34:09.944 --> 01:34:13.948 region:rollup2
GOOD TIME IN YOUR BUILDING.

01:34:12.113 --> 01:34:15.183 region:rollup2
BETTER PUBLIC WAITING SPACES.

01:34:13.948 --> 01:34:16.918 region:rollup2
WAS HIGHLY.

01:34:15.183 --> 01:34:19.053 region:rollup2
SOUGHT DURING THE INTERVIEWS

01:34:16.918 --> 01:34:20.388 region:rollup2
AND SO SPACES NEED TO BE.

01:34:19.053 --> 01:34:21.523 region:rollup2
CONFIGURED IN SUCH A WAY WHERE

01:34:20.388 --> 01:34:23.324 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC IS NO LONGER.

01:34:21.523 --> 01:34:24.292 region:rollup2
.

01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:25.760 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO SIT ON BENCHES OUT

01:34:24.292 --> 01:34:26.160 region:rollup2
THE QUARTERS.

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:28.763 region:rollup2
WHICH.

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:30.532 region:rollup2
BOTH INHIBITS EXITING AS WELL

01:34:28.763 --> 01:34:30.532 region:rollup2
AS DOES NOT ACTUALLY PROVIDE

01:34:30.598 --> 01:34:33.401 region:rollup2
.

01:34:32.267 --> 01:34:35.670 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE.

01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:37.572 region:rollup2
AWAITING ENVIRONMENT.

01:34:35.670 --> 01:34:39.107 region:rollup2
WE WE WOULD THINK THAT THERE IS

01:34:37.572 --> 01:34:40.608 region:rollup2
A POTENTIAL FOR LOUNGES EVER

01:34:39.107 --> 01:34:40.909 region:rollup2
SPACES WHERE PEOPLE COULD WATCH

01:34:40.608 --> 01:34:42.310 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:34:40.909 --> 01:34:43.678 region:rollup2
.

01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:44.646 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IN ACTION THAT COULD

01:34:43.678 --> 01:34:47.315 region:rollup2
ALSO FUNCTIONS SOME OF THESE

01:34:44.646 --> 01:34:48.816 region:rollup2
PUBLIC WAITING SPACES.

01:34:47.315 --> 01:34:50.985 region:rollup2
CREATING AN ADDITIONAL HEARING

01:34:48.816 --> 01:34:52.720 region:rollup2
ROOMS OF VARYING SIZES.

01:34:50.985 --> 01:34:54.289 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH GREATER

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:55.857 region:rollup2
ACCESS AND ENGAGEMENT.

01:34:54.289 --> 01:34:57.625 region:rollup2
THE BUSINESS OF THE GOVERNMENT.

01:34:55.857 --> 01:34:59.527 region:rollup2
IT'S HIGHLY DESIRED.

01:34:57.625 --> 01:35:01.563 region:rollup2
WE'VE ADDED IN THE PROGRAM THE

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:03.731 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WERE FOOTAGE.

01:35:01.563 --> 01:35:04.098 region:rollup2
THESE ASPECTS INTO THE PROJECT

01:35:03.731 --> 01:35:05.533 region:rollup2
WHICH ACTUALLY.

01:35:04.098 --> 01:35:07.569 region:rollup2
.

01:35:05.533 --> 01:35:09.604 region:rollup2
IN MOST WAYS BROUGHT ALMOST ALL

01:35:07.569 --> 01:35:11.206 region:rollup2
THE HEARING SPACES BACK INTO THE

01:35:09.604 --> 01:35:12.740 region:rollup2
CAPITAL UNICODE SOLID DATED

01:35:11.206 --> 01:35:14.208 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC LOCATION ALLOWING

01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:16.945 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO GO FROM ONE HEARING TO

01:35:14.208 --> 01:35:18.046 region:rollup2
ANOTHER HEARING. EITHER AS A.

01:35:16.945 --> 01:35:19.781 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT

01:35:18.046 --> 01:35:21.216 region:rollup2
OR THE PUBLIC TRYING TO ATTEND

01:35:19.781 --> 01:35:22.784 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE HEARINGS WITHOUT HAVING

01:35:21.216 --> 01:35:25.320 region:rollup2
TO TRAVERSE THE LAWNS ARE YARDS

01:35:22.784 --> 01:35:27.288 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE.

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:29.724 region:rollup2
MORE COMMON USE AREA.

01:35:27.288 --> 01:35:31.926 region:rollup2
WITH A.

01:35:29.724 --> 01:35:32.527 region:rollup2
PLANNING STUDY IDENTIFIED.

01:35:31.926 --> 01:35:34.729 region:rollup2
INEFFICIENT

01:35:32.527 --> 01:35:37.432 region:rollup2
AND.

01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:38.833 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY A VERY LOW NUMBER

01:35:37.432 --> 01:35:40.068 region:rollup2
OF PUBLIC UTILITIES THAT WERE

01:35:38.833 --> 01:35:40.368 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE.

01:35:40.068 --> 01:35:42.036 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO.

01:35:40.368 --> 01:35:44.172 region:rollup2
.

01:35:42.036 --> 01:35:45.540 region:rollup2
I GUESS

01:35:44.172 --> 01:35:46.641 region:rollup2
WAS NO LIMIT TO THE AMOUNT OF

01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:47.942 region:rollup2
TOILET ROOMS YOU CAN PUT INTO

01:35:46.641 --> 01:35:49.510 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING OTHER THAN YOU

01:35:47.942 --> 01:35:51.179 region:rollup2
CAN'T BE LESS THAN A CERTAIN

01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:52.780 region:rollup2
NUMBER AND YOU GUYS ARE WELL

01:35:51.179 --> 01:35:54.382 region:rollup2
BELOW THE THE LOWEST NUMBER

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:55.650 region:rollup2
FOR AYE TOILET FACILITIES WITHIN

01:35:54.382 --> 01:35:56.584 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING YOU COULD ADD MORE

01:35:55.650 --> 01:35:57.852 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE WOULD SUGGEST IS

01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:59.253 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:35:57.852 --> 01:36:00.722 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE PROGRAMMING WHAT WE

01:35:59.253 --> 01:36:02.056 region:rollup2
DECIDED WAS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING

01:36:00.722 --> 01:36:03.391 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF

01:36:02.056 --> 01:36:05.627 region:rollup2
HEARING SPACES YOU'LL HAVE.

01:36:03.391 --> 01:36:07.328 region:rollup2
A CONSOLIDATED AREA OF TOILET

01:36:05.627 --> 01:36:08.630 region:rollup2
FACILITIES AVAILABLE FOR THOSE

01:36:07.328 --> 01:36:10.164 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF

01:36:08.630 --> 01:36:10.965 region:rollup2
USERS THAT WOULD BE THERE. BUT

01:36:10.164 --> 01:36:11.699 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE

01:36:10.965 --> 01:36:12.967 region:rollup2
BUILDING YOU WOULD HAVE

01:36:11.699 --> 01:36:14.402 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE NUMBERS OF TOILET

01:36:12.967 --> 01:36:16.471 region:rollup2
FACILITIES KNOWS ARE ALL

01:36:14.402 --> 01:36:17.739 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE PROGRAM AS

01:36:16.471 --> 01:36:19.340 region:rollup2
FAR AS NUMBERS GO.

01:36:17.739 --> 01:36:21.409 region:rollup2
CONFERENCE ROOMS WORKROOMS EXIT

01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:23.511 region:rollup2
STAIRS ELEVATORS ALL OF THOSE

01:36:21.409 --> 01:36:25.346 region:rollup2
WHICH FALL WITHIN THE NORMAL

01:36:23.511 --> 01:36:26.014 region:rollup2
EVERYDAY ACCESS POWS.

01:36:25.346 --> 01:36:28.116 region:rollup2
WERE.

01:36:26.014 --> 01:36:29.350 region:rollup2
SEEN IN THE PREVIOUS.

01:36:28.116 --> 01:36:31.219 region:rollup2
IN THIS EXISTING BUILDING AS

01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:32.620 region:rollup2
BEING AN ADEQUATE. AND IN

01:36:31.219 --> 01:36:34.188 region:rollup2
PROGRAMMING THOSE NUMBERS WERE

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:35.056 region:rollup2
GROSSED OUT TO ALLOW FOR.

01:36:34.188 --> 01:36:37.258 region:rollup2
BETTER.

01:36:35.056 --> 01:36:38.593 region:rollup2
DISBURSEMENT THROUGHOUT THE

01:36:37.258 --> 01:36:42.563 region:rollup2
BUILDING AND I'LL OF PEOPLE.

01:36:38.593 --> 01:36:44.532 region:rollup2
I GUESS BETTER ACCESS TO THOSE.

01:36:42.563 --> 01:36:46.100 region:rollup2
CONSISTENCY OF SPACE PLANNING

01:36:44.532 --> 01:36:48.269 region:rollup2
AYE AND DESIGN WAS ONE OF THE

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:50.071 region:rollup2
DESIRES BY MOST OF THE PEOPLE WE

01:36:48.269 --> 01:36:52.106 region:rollup2
TALKED TO. THERE'S TOO MANY

01:36:50.071 --> 01:36:54.475 region:rollup2
INCONSISTENT SPACES.

01:36:52.106 --> 01:36:55.576 region:rollup2
AND IT'S DIFFICULT FROM OFFICE

01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:57.311 region:rollup2
TO OFFICE TO KNOW HOW.

01:36:55.576 --> 01:36:58.980 region:rollup2
HOW THOSE WHO ARE CONFIGURED?

01:36:57.311 --> 01:36:59.914 region:rollup2
AND SO SOME CONSISTENCY WITHIN

01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:02.050 region:rollup2
OUR MODEL WE.

01:36:59.914 --> 01:37:04.018 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED A CERTAIN SIZE OF

01:37:02.050 --> 01:37:04.519 region:rollup2
SPACE FOR A TYPICAL OFFICE A

01:37:04.018 --> 01:37:06.587 region:rollup2
TYPICAL FUNCTION A TO. A

01:37:04.519 --> 01:37:09.190 region:rollup2

01:37:09.190 --> 01:37:11.726 region:rollup2
AND SO ON.

01:37:10.058 --> 01:37:12.860 region:rollup2
WAS ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED AND

01:37:11.726 --> 01:37:14.562 region:rollup2
THAT WAS WHAT WAS IDENTIFIED

01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:16.064 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE SPACE PROGRAM. AND

01:37:17.732 --> 01:37:20.868 region:rollup2
GROSSED UP THE NUMBERS TO ALLOW

01:37:19.834 --> 01:37:22.637 region:rollup2
FOR THE CONGESTION IS IT'S.

01:37:20.868 --> 01:37:24.105 region:rollup2
CIRCULATION AND CERTAIN AREAS

01:37:22.637 --> 01:37:24.639 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE BUILDING TO MAKE SURE

01:37:24.105 --> 01:37:25.673 region:rollup2
THAT IT WAS EASIER TO GET

01:37:24.639 --> 01:37:26.074 region:rollup2
AROUND.

01:37:25.673 --> 01:37:28.142 region:rollup2
WAS SAFE FOR FIRE.

01:37:26.074 --> 01:37:28.943 region:rollup2

AT AT THIS POINT IN TIME THEY

01:37:31.579 --> 01:37:34.882 region:rollup2
THERE IS A. SERIES OF NOTES

01:37:33.514 --> 01:37:36.417 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A

01:37:34.882 --> 01:37:37.518 region:rollup2
LARGE NUMBER PEOPLE SPREAD OUT

01:37:36.417 --> 01:37:39.287 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE QUARTERS IT'S A LOT

01:37:37.518 --> 01:37:40.355 region:rollup2
HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO GATHER THEM

01:37:39.287 --> 01:37:44.125 region:rollup2
TOGETHER IN A.

01:37:40.355 --> 01:37:46.494 region:rollup2
I EMERGENCY SITUATION.

THROUGHOUT FOR THE STAKEHOLDERS

01:38:00.441 --> 01:38:03.945 region:rollup2
AND NEEDED BY THE USERS WITHIN

01:38:02.176 --> 01:38:06.681 region:rollup2

01:38:03.945 --> 01:38:08.816 region:rollup2
OF THE CAPITAL ANNEX BUILDING.

01:38:06.681 --> 01:38:10.218 region:rollup2

EVERYBODY ACTIVE AND HEALTHY.

01:40:04.765 --> 01:40:06.767 region:rollup2
JUST ANOTHER SUGGESTION

01:40:06.167 --> 01:40:07.335 region:rollup2
WELL I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD

01:40:06.767 --> 01:40:09.303 region:rollup2
FIT WITHIN THE SUSTAINABLE

01:40:07.335 --> 01:40:12.573 region:rollup2
DESIGN PRINCIPLES.

01:40:09.303 --> 01:40:15.710 region:rollup2
IT IS EXPECTED THAT. ANYTHING

01:40:12.573 --> 01:40:17.612 region:rollup2
WE DO WILL. PURSUE. APPROPRIATE

01:40:15.710 --> 01:40:18.145 region:rollup2
LEAD CERTIFICATION COMPLY WITH

01:40:23.017 --> 01:40:26.320 region:rollup2
SO BY KEENAN ALL MANNER OF

01:40:25.152 --> 01:40:28.022 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE THAT I THINK WOULD

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:30.658 region:rollup2
BE A PART OF THAT CONVERSATION.

01:40:28.022 --> 01:40:32.460 region:rollup2
.

01:40:30.658 --> 01:40:34.095 region:rollup2

01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:35.696 region:rollup2
GREAT.

01:40:34.095 --> 01:40:37.031 region:rollup2

01:41:04.926 --> 01:41:08.362 region:rollup2
DESIGN WHO WAS SORT OF AWKWARD

01:41:07.061 --> 01:41:10.498 region:rollup2
DID YOU GET ASSEMBLYMEMBERS IN

01:41:08.362 --> 01:41:12.333 region:rollup2

BUT WE DO YOU CAN YOU DIG INTO

01:41:20.207 --> 01:41:23.277 region:rollup2
THE RHYME OR REASON FOR SOME OF

01:41:21.342 --> 01:41:24.345 region:rollup2
THE DESIGN FEATURES.

01:41:23.277 --> 01:41:25.913 region:rollup2
WE DID ACTUALLY LOOK AT ALL.

01:41:24.345 --> 01:41:27.081 region:rollup2
KIND OF HISTORIC DOCUMENTS AND

01:41:25.913 --> 01:41:28.282 region:rollup2

WHAT WE WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT

01:41:31.819 --> 01:41:35.189 region:rollup2
AS YOU GUYS GREW YOU RAN OUT OF

01:41:33.287 --> 01:41:36.591 region:rollup2
SPACE AND PEOPLE JUST TOOK

01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:38.225 region:rollup2
WHATEVER SPACE I COULD POSSIBLY

01:41:36.591 --> 01:41:40.294 region:rollup2
DO AND IT'S MOVED?

01:41:38.225 --> 01:41:41.495 region:rollup2
SHIFTED MANY TIMES THROUGHOUT

01:41:40.294 --> 01:41:43.030 region:rollup2
ITS HISTORY OF BEING HERE IT WAS

01:41:41.495 --> 01:41:44.565 region:rollup2
NOT I DON'T THINK.

01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:46.334 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO HAVE SOME OF THE

01:41:44.565 --> 01:41:48.002 region:rollup2
SPACE IS OCCUPIED AS OFFICE

01:41:46.334 --> 01:41:50.304 region:rollup2
SPACES BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE.

01:41:48.002 --> 01:41:51.272 region:rollup2
DREADFUL OFFICE SPACES AND

01:41:50.304 --> 01:41:51.839 region:rollup2
QUITE HONESTLY I DON'T BELIEVE

01:41:51.272 --> 01:41:52.406 region:rollup2
MOST OF THOSE ACTION COMPLY

01:41:51.839 --> 01:41:54.108 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:41:52.406 --> 01:41:56.043 region:rollup2
BUILDING CODES.

01:41:54.108 --> 01:41:57.244 region:rollup2
OKAY AT LEAST NOT TODAY'S

01:41:56.043 --> 01:41:58.412 region:rollup2
BUILDING CODES AND I'M PRETTY

01:41:57.244 --> 01:41:59.647 region:rollup2
SURE THAT MAY NOT HAVE COMPLIED

01:41:58.412 --> 01:42:01.949 region:rollup2
WITH BUILDING BECAUSE OF THAT

01:41:59.647 --> 01:42:02.149 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC POINT TIME. BUT YOU YOU

01:42:01.949 --> 01:42:02.416 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:04.619 region:rollup2
.

01:42:02.416 --> 01:42:04.952 region:rollup2
I'D.

01:42:04.619 --> 01:42:06.821 region:rollup2
QUOTE UNQUOTE.

01:42:04.952 --> 01:42:07.622 region:rollup2
.

01:42:06.821 --> 01:42:10.157 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING IS A STRAIGHT

01:42:07.622 --> 01:42:11.859 region:rollup2
JACKET FOR EXPANSION AND.

01:42:10.157 --> 01:42:13.628 region:rollup2
WITH THAT THAT MEANS THAT YOU

01:42:11.859 --> 01:42:15.296 region:rollup2
HAVE TO KIND OF FIT WHATEVER YOU

01:42:13.628 --> 01:42:17.198 region:rollup2
CAN WITHIN THE TIGHT ENVELOPE

01:42:15.296 --> 01:42:18.699 region:rollup2
THAT YOU HAVE AND SO.

01:42:17.198 --> 01:42:19.767 region:rollup2
WE CAN IDENTIFY Y. ALTERNATELY

01:42:18.699 --> 01:42:21.302 region:rollup2
PUT ON THERE BUT WE KNOW THAT IT

01:42:19.767 --> 01:42:22.937 region:rollup2
WAS BECAUSE YOU JUST HAD NOWHERE

01:42:21.302 --> 01:42:24.171 region:rollup2
ELSE TO PUT THEM.

01:42:22.937 --> 01:42:24.772 region:rollup2
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WAS EVER

01:42:24.171 --> 01:42:26.607 region:rollup2
THE INTENTION OF WHAT ACTUALLY

01:42:24.772 --> 01:42:27.541 region:rollup2
HAPPENED.

01:42:26.607 --> 01:42:28.109 region:rollup2
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE

01:42:27.541 --> 01:42:30.344 region:rollup2
STRUCTURAL STEEL PROCUREMENT

01:42:28.109 --> 01:42:32.980 region:rollup2
LAW.

01:42:30.344 --> 01:42:34.582 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:35.416 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THAT ONE OKAY. FREE

01:42:34.582 --> 01:42:36.484 region:rollup2
YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK INTO

01:42:35.416 --> 01:42:39.453 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S BEEN KIND OF AN

01:42:36.484 --> 01:42:41.489 region:rollup2
AWKWARD DILEMMA FOR PROJECTS.

01:42:39.453 --> 01:42:43.290 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY CALTRANS AND I JUST

01:42:41.489 --> 01:42:45.359 region:rollup2
WANNA KNOW IF IT'S. ALSO.

01:42:43.290 --> 01:42:48.863 region:rollup2
PERTINENT TO THIS CERTAIN*.

01:42:45.359 --> 01:42:51.332 region:rollup2
LIKE IS NOT GETTING EMAILS FROM.

01:42:48.863 --> 01:42:54.135 region:rollup2
VENDORS THAT HURDLE FRUSTRATED.

01:42:51.332 --> 01:42:56.137 region:rollup2
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT TIMING AND

01:42:54.135 --> 01:42:59.206 region:rollup2
THIS IS MAYBE A MULTI.

01:42:56.137 --> 01:43:01.175 region:rollup2
LONG QUESTION BUT.

01:42:59.206 --> 01:43:03.411 region:rollup2
WHO WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD?

01:43:01.175 --> 01:43:05.646 region:rollup2
IN THE COUNTY OF ORANGE TERMINAL

01:43:03.411 --> 01:43:07.448 region:rollup2
C. TO THE JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT.

01:43:05.646 --> 01:43:08.682 region:rollup2
WE BUILT IT STARTING ABOUT TWO

01:43:07.448 --> 01:43:09.884 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND

01:43:08.682 --> 01:43:10.785 region:rollup2
EIGHT WHEN WE WERE IN A

01:43:09.884 --> 01:43:12.386 region:rollup2
RECESSION WE WERE ABLE TO GET.

01:43:10.785 --> 01:43:14.221 region:rollup2
GREAT BIDS

01:43:12.386 --> 01:43:15.623 region:rollup2
YOU NO ASSEMBLY A CONSTRUCTION

01:43:14.221 --> 01:43:17.792 region:rollup2
COSTS WERE LOWER BECAUSE THERE

01:43:15.623 --> 01:43:19.060 region:rollup2
WAS JUST NOT A LOT OF.

01:43:17.792 --> 01:43:20.194 region:rollup2
GOING ON I WAS TELLING MATURE

01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:21.595 region:rollup2
THAT I WOULD TO WERE. THE

01:43:20.194 --> 01:43:23.264 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION EVERY SIX WEEKS BUT

01:43:21.595 --> 01:43:25.399 region:rollup2
THE HARD HAT ON THE.

01:43:23.264 --> 01:43:26.267 region:rollup2
HARD SHOWS YOU KNOW TO. THE

01:43:25.399 --> 01:43:28.235 region:rollup2
CHOOSE.

01:43:26.267 --> 01:43:29.470 region:rollup2
IN THE END THE EMILY EMPLOYEES

01:43:28.235 --> 01:43:31.806 region:rollup2
WHICH ARE PART OF JUST THANKS

01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:33.074 region:rollup2
FOR HELPING US SO WE WE BUILT

01:43:31.806 --> 01:43:34.475 region:rollup2
THAT WAY UNDER BUDGET.

01:43:33.074 --> 01:43:36.043 region:rollup2
AND SO WE HAVE THESE ECONOMIC

01:43:34.475 --> 01:43:37.445 region:rollup2
CYCLES

01:43:36.043 --> 01:43:38.512 region:rollup2
ITS OATH STATE IS ISSUING BONDS

01:43:37.445 --> 01:43:40.114 region:rollup2
AND EVERYBODY'S BUILDING NEW

01:43:38.512 --> 01:43:41.649 region:rollup2
SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND. ALL THIS

01:43:40.114 --> 01:43:43.684 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES GOING ON WE'RE GONNA

01:43:41.649 --> 01:43:45.686 region:rollup2
HAVE TO COMPETE MAYBE PAY MORE

01:43:43.684 --> 01:43:47.021 region:rollup2
WAIT LONGER. AND AND I'M JUST

01:43:45.686 --> 01:43:48.889 region:rollup2
CURIOUS I KNOW YOU DON'T SEE THE

01:43:47.021 --> 01:43:50.991 region:rollup2
FUTURE BUT HOW DO WE. HOW DO WE

01:43:48.889 --> 01:43:52.426 region:rollup2
TIME IT WERE AT THE OTHER DAY

01:43:50.991 --> 01:43:54.762 region:rollup2
WAS A POINTED WE BUILD THIS?

01:43:52.426 --> 01:43:55.930 region:rollup2
AT THE RIGHT TIME IS WE.

01:43:54.762 --> 01:43:56.464 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS

01:43:55.930 --> 01:43:58.165 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT

01:43:56.464 --> 01:43:59.934 region:rollup2
THING.

01:43:58.165 --> 01:44:02.837 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS VERY QUESTION.

01:43:59.934 --> 01:44:05.172 region:rollup2
WHEN WE DID OUR ANALYSIS FOR.

01:44:02.837 --> 01:44:06.841 region:rollup2
ARC ARE COSTING WHAT WE DID IS

01:44:05.172 --> 01:44:08.375 region:rollup2
WE TOOK INDUSTRY STANDARDS FOR

01:44:06.841 --> 01:44:09.977 region:rollup2
WHAT ESCALATION IS ACROSS THE

01:44:08.375 --> 01:44:11.612 region:rollup2
TEN YEAR PERIOD AND WE TALK AND

01:44:09.977 --> 01:44:13.147 region:rollup2
EVALUATION OF.

01:44:11.612 --> 01:44:14.782 region:rollup2
A WHOLE LOT OF YOUR CAPITOL

01:44:13.147 --> 01:44:16.083 region:rollup2
BUILDING OUR ERA COURTHOUSE

01:44:14.782 --> 01:44:17.518 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS I GOT BUILT OVER THAT

01:44:16.083 --> 01:44:19.253 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF TIME WE DIDN'T

01:44:17.518 --> 01:44:21.288 region:rollup2
EVALUATION ON THAT AND. WHAT IT

01:44:19.253 --> 01:44:21.889 region:rollup2
SHOWED TO US IS THAT YEARS AGO

01:44:21.288 --> 01:44:23.824 region:rollup2
THERE WAS?

01:44:21.889 --> 01:44:25.359 region:rollup2
LESS ESCALATION THEN THERE IS

01:44:23.824 --> 01:44:27.328 region:rollup2
YOUR CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING BUT

01:44:25.359 --> 01:44:28.028 region:rollup2
OVERALL THAT ESCALATION WAS TWO

01:44:27.328 --> 01:44:29.997 region:rollup2
POINT FIVE.

01:44:28.028 --> 01:44:31.398 region:rollup2
I THINK TODAY AND TODAY'S WORLD

01:44:29.997 --> 01:44:32.933 region:rollup2
IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

01:44:31.398 --> 01:44:33.934 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT THAN ALL OTHER TIMES

01:44:32.933 --> 01:44:35.069 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE HAD A SOURCE

01:44:33.934 --> 01:44:35.936 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTIONS CON BECAUSE

01:44:35.069 --> 01:44:37.071 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:38.606 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION GOING ON IN THE

01:44:37.071 --> 01:44:40.307 region:rollup2
UNITED STATES. IN THE PAST

01:44:38.606 --> 01:44:41.709 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS WE DON'T HAVE A

01:44:40.307 --> 01:44:43.477 region:rollup2
CRYSTAL BALL TO TELL US WILL

01:44:41.709 --> 01:44:44.678 region:rollup2
THAT CONTINUE.

01:44:43.477 --> 01:44:46.280 region:rollup2
WE DO KNOW THAT WITH.

01:44:44.678 --> 01:44:47.848 region:rollup2
WITH THIS KIND OF PROJECTS TO

01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:50.351 region:rollup2
BANG AND HOW YOU APPROACH THEM.

01:44:47.848 --> 01:44:52.686 region:rollup2
AS YOU PROCEED TO END OF THE

01:44:50.351 --> 01:44:53.888 region:rollup2
DESIGN CYCLE THE DESIGN CYCLING

01:44:52.686 --> 01:44:56.690 region:rollup2
SELF WILL PROBABLY TAKE.

01:44:53.888 --> 01:44:57.458 region:rollup2
JUST TO GARNER ENOUGH AGREEMENT

01:44:56.690 --> 01:44:58.759 region:rollup2
FROM EVERYBODY THAT WOULD BE

01:44:57.458 --> 01:45:00.361 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN DESIGN CYCLE

01:44:58.759 --> 01:45:01.896 region:rollup2
PROBABLY TWO YEARS AND MAYBE TWO

01:45:00.361 --> 01:45:02.463 region:rollup2
AND A HALF YEARS JUST TO GET TO

01:45:01.896 --> 01:45:03.464 region:rollup2
THE POINT WHERE YOU ACTUALLY

01:45:02.463 --> 01:45:05.366 region:rollup2
READY.

01:45:03.464 --> 01:45:06.667 region:rollup2
TO DO THE CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE

01:45:05.366 --> 01:45:08.602 region:rollup2
THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER LOGISTICS

01:45:06.667 --> 01:45:09.203 region:rollup2
HAVE TWO ONE THREE THAT PROCESS

01:45:08.602 --> 01:45:10.571 region:rollup2
OF SUCH AS WHERE IS EVERYBODY

01:45:09.203 --> 01:45:11.972 region:rollup2
MOVING TO.

01:45:10.571 --> 01:45:12.907 region:rollup2
AND.

01:45:11.972 --> 01:45:14.341 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING ELSE.

01:45:12.907 --> 01:45:15.843 region:rollup2
THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF

01:45:14.341 --> 01:45:17.745 region:rollup2
TELECOMMUNICATION ISSUES THAT

01:45:15.843 --> 01:45:18.979 region:rollup2
COME UP THAT HOW DO YOU REMOTE

01:45:17.745 --> 01:45:20.181 region:rollup2
THOSE TO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN

01:45:18.979 --> 01:45:21.649 region:rollup2
ALL THE SINK SO THERE'S A LOT OF

01:45:20.181 --> 01:45:23.017 region:rollup2
THE JUST SIX THE HASTERT HAPPEN

01:45:21.649 --> 01:45:24.652 region:rollup2
BEFORE YOU CAN ACTUALLY. PUT A

01:45:23.017 --> 01:45:25.853 region:rollup2
SPADE IN THE GROUND.

01:45:24.652 --> 01:45:26.720 region:rollup2
ONCE THAT'S ALL DONE THE

01:45:25.853 --> 01:45:27.655 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION ITSELF WILL

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:29.490 region:rollup2
PROBABLY TAKE ABOUT.

01:45:27.655 --> 01:45:30.090 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS JUST TO MAKE SURE

01:45:29.490 --> 01:45:31.759 region:rollup2
THAT YOU DO IT.

01:45:30.090 --> 01:45:33.427 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY A COULD TAKE A

01:45:31.759 --> 01:45:34.328 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT LONGER BUT I.

01:45:33.427 --> 01:45:35.296 region:rollup2
I CAN'T BELIEVE IN TODAY'S

01:45:34.328 --> 01:45:37.131 region:rollup2
SOCIETY WE CAN BUILD THIS

01:45:35.296 --> 01:45:37.531 region:rollup2
BUILDING IN THREE YEARS.

01:45:37.131 --> 01:45:40.034 region:rollup2
WITH THAT THOUGH.

01:45:37.531 --> 01:45:40.968 region:rollup2
.

01:45:40.034 --> 01:45:43.671 region:rollup2
DEPEND WHAT YOU'RE TRENDS ARE IF

01:45:40.968 --> 01:45:46.140 region:rollup2
YOU DO DECIDE AT THIS POINT TIME

01:45:43.671 --> 01:45:47.274 region:rollup2
OUR ACROSS THE STATE TO.

01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:47.741 region:rollup2
YOU'VE ALREADY DONE A LOT OF

01:45:47.274 --> 01:45:49.310 region:rollup2
THE.

01:45:47.741 --> 01:45:51.445 region:rollup2
THE COURTHOUSE PROJECTS WHICH

01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:53.614 region:rollup2
WAS A SIGNIFICANT.

01:45:51.445 --> 01:45:55.349 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTION EFFORT BUT IF YOU DO

01:45:53.614 --> 01:45:56.917 region:rollup2
REBUILD A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

01:45:55.349 --> 01:45:57.818 region:rollup2
YOUR EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES

01:45:56.917 --> 01:45:59.620 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE NATION ARE YOU HAVE

01:45:57.818 --> 01:46:01.555 region:rollup2
LARGE.

01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:03.791 region:rollup2
DANCES OF CONSTRUCTION THAT GO

01:46:01.555 --> 01:46:06.293 region:rollup2
ON THAT WILL MODIFY POTENTIALLY

01:46:03.791 --> 01:46:06.760 region:rollup2
THE AVAILABILITY OF. LABOR TO

01:46:06.293 --> 01:46:08.362 region:rollup2
WORK ON THE BUILDING.

01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:10.130 region:rollup2
.

01:46:08.362 --> 01:46:11.365 region:rollup2
AND YOU WILL WE WOULD SUGGEST

01:46:10.130 --> 01:46:12.766 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ACTUALLY MODERATE THEN

01:46:11.365 --> 01:46:13.901 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY WHAT THE SCHEDULE IS

01:46:12.766 --> 01:46:15.869 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SO YOU

01:46:13.901 --> 01:46:17.638 region:rollup2
DON'T FORCE ANYTHING TO RAPIDLY

01:46:15.869 --> 01:46:18.539 region:rollup2
THAT CAR COST YOU MORE MONEY AND

01:46:17.638 --> 01:46:19.640 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE GIVING YOU A

01:46:18.539 --> 01:46:20.908 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT LONGER PERIOD TO WORK

01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:22.910 region:rollup2
THIS OUT SO YOU CAN.

01:46:20.908 --> 01:46:24.612 region:rollup2
SPREAD THAT AND. MAKE SURE YOU

01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:25.779 region:rollup2
FIND THE MANPOWER AVAILABLE FOR

01:46:24.612 --> 01:46:26.080 region:rollup2
THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD AS IT

01:46:25.779 --> 01:46:28.616 region:rollup2
MIGHT FALL.

01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:30.618 region:rollup2
.

01:46:28.616 --> 01:46:31.485 region:rollup2
BY THE SAME TOKEN IT MIGHT BE.

01:46:30.618 --> 01:46:33.687 region:rollup2
MORE COST EFFECTIVELY DO A

01:46:31.485 --> 01:46:35.055 region:rollup2
QUICKER AND SO THAT THE ECONOMIC

01:46:33.687 --> 01:46:36.824 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS THAT WOULD ACTUALLY

01:46:35.055 --> 01:46:38.192 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE TAKEN INTO A PLACE.

01:46:36.824 --> 01:46:39.226 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU LOOK FORWARD AND YOU

01:46:38.192 --> 01:46:40.661 region:rollup2
CAN FORECAST AT ALL THOSE

01:46:39.226 --> 01:46:42.730 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS WILL BE BUILT HERE BUT

01:46:40.661 --> 01:46:44.064 region:rollup2
WE COULD FIND A WAY TO ACTUALLY

01:46:42.730 --> 01:46:45.966 region:rollup2
GET THIS MOVING FORWARD EARLIER.

01:46:44.064 --> 01:46:46.767 region:rollup2
YOU'RE BUYING A CONTRACT PRIOR

01:46:45.966 --> 01:46:48.535 region:rollup2

01:46:46.767 --> 01:46:50.004 region:rollup2
ALL THOSE OTHERS IT'S

01:46:48.535 --> 01:46:50.804 region:rollup2
DETRIMENTAL TO YOUR STATE ONE

01:46:50.004 --> 01:46:51.939 region:rollup2
WAY OR THE OTHER SOMEBODY'S

01:46:50.804 --> 01:46:53.007 region:rollup2
GONNA HAVE TO PAY A LITTLE BIT

01:46:51.939 --> 01:46:53.607 region:rollup2
MORE FOR THEIR BUILDINGS IF YOU

01:46:53.007 --> 01:46:54.875 region:rollup2
TRY TO BUILD THEM ALL THE SAME

01:46:53.607 --> 01:46:56.443 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:46:54.875 --> 01:46:58.445 region:rollup2
AND I GENERAL CONSTRAINT JUST AN

01:46:56.443 --> 01:47:00.147 region:rollup2
OBSERVATION FOR MY COLLEAGUES ON

01:46:58.445 --> 01:47:02.116 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE. WE YOU PROBABLY

01:47:00.147 --> 01:47:03.517 region:rollup2
END UP.

01:47:02.116 --> 01:47:05.419 region:rollup2
TIMING THE PROJECT GENERALLY TO

01:47:03.517 --> 01:47:07.154 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU WOULD KICK IT OFF.

01:47:05.419 --> 01:47:08.322 region:rollup2
AND WOULD BE MOVING BACK AND

01:47:07.154 --> 01:47:09.990 region:rollup2
TO THE FALL OF AN ODD NUMBERED

01:47:08.322 --> 01:47:11.358 region:rollup2
YEAR.

01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:13.127 region:rollup2
SO IT'S PROBABLY NOT OPPORTUNE

01:47:11.358 --> 01:47:15.496 region:rollup2
TO BE ENGAGED IN DESTRUCTION OF

01:47:13.127 --> 01:47:17.698 region:rollup2
OFFICES WITH WHOLESALE MOVES.

01:47:15.496 --> 01:47:18.766 region:rollup2

YEAH AND AND THIS IS THIS WAS

01:47:22.469 --> 01:47:24.905 region:rollup2
THE CASE WHEN THEY DID THE WEST

01:47:23.537 --> 01:47:27.007 region:rollup2
WING.

01:47:24.905 --> 01:47:29.243 region:rollup2
YOUR KEY MOVES HAPPEN IN THE

01:47:27.007 --> 01:47:30.878 region:rollup2
FALL YOUR KEY TRANSITION FROM

01:47:29.243 --> 01:47:32.179 region:rollup2
ONE FACILITY TO A NEW FACILITY

01:47:30.878 --> 01:47:33.447 region:rollup2
HAPPEN IN THE FALL OF THAT ODD

01:47:32.179 --> 01:47:34.181 region:rollup2
NUMBERED YEAR.

01:47:33.447 --> 01:47:37.718 region:rollup2
SO I JUST.

01:47:34.181 --> 01:47:38.819 region:rollup2
I SORT OF THINK WE NEED TO.

01:47:37.718 --> 01:47:39.320 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THAT LOOK AT THE STUDIES

01:47:38.819 --> 01:47:42.356 region:rollup2
THAT NEED TO BE DONE THE

01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:44.224 region:rollup2
GROUNDS.

01:47:42.356 --> 01:47:45.559 region:rollup2
THE SWING SPACE AND WE'RE

01:47:44.224 --> 01:47:46.894 region:rollup2
PROBABLY TALKING FOR THE BIG

01:47:45.559 --> 01:47:48.796 region:rollup2
MOVES.

01:47:46.894 --> 01:47:50.531 region:rollup2
THAT NEED TO HAPPEN.

01:47:48.796 --> 01:47:51.532 region:rollup2
TO TRANSITION FROM ONE

01:47:50.531 --> 01:47:52.132 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED SYSTEM WITH ALL THE

01:47:51.532 --> 01:47:53.767 region:rollup2
PARTS WORKING TO SUPPORT OUR

01:47:52.132 --> 01:47:55.102 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT'S.

01:47:53.767 --> 01:47:56.036 region:rollup2
TO ANOTHER ESTABLISHED SETTING

01:47:55.102 --> 01:47:57.471 region:rollup2
WITH ALL THE PARTS WERE TO

01:47:56.036 --> 01:47:59.573 region:rollup2
SUPPORT OUR GOVERNANCE. HAS

01:47:57.471 --> 01:48:01.342 region:rollup2
HAPPENED THE FALL OF NINETEEN

01:47:59.573 --> 01:48:03.711 region:rollup2
TWENTY ONE NINETEEN TWENTY

01:48:01.342 --> 01:48:05.746 region:rollup2
NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

01:48:03.711 --> 01:48:07.514 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU THAT THAT'S BECOMES A

01:48:05.746 --> 01:48:08.682 region:rollup2
PRACTICALITY.

01:48:07.514 --> 01:48:10.017 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE A WORKING TO THE

01:48:08.682 --> 01:48:11.185 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

01:48:10.017 --> 01:48:12.653 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING THE EXECUTIVE AND

01:48:11.185 --> 01:48:15.356 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH.

01:48:12.653 --> 01:48:17.324 region:rollup2
AND THE WELCOMING PUBLIC AND WE

01:48:15.356 --> 01:48:18.926 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO HURRY UP TRANSITION

01:48:17.324 --> 01:48:20.828 region:rollup2
FROM ONE TO THE OTHER.

01:48:18.926 --> 01:48:22.162 region:rollup2
TO FACILITATE PROGRESS THAT'S

01:48:20.828 --> 01:48:24.031 region:rollup2
ANOTHER MARKER. THAT'LL AFFECT

01:48:22.162 --> 01:48:25.599 region:rollup2
WHERE WE.

01:48:24.031 --> 01:48:27.868 region:rollup2
WHERE WE ARE THE CYCLE? BUT WE

01:48:25.599 --> 01:48:29.370 region:rollup2
JUST PERFECT I THINK WE JUST

01:48:27.868 --> 01:48:30.471 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO PROCEED WITH ALACRITY

01:48:29.370 --> 01:48:32.239 region:rollup2
AND DO THE PLANNING STUDIES.

01:48:30.471 --> 01:48:33.574 region:rollup2
.

01:48:32.239 --> 01:48:35.275 region:rollup2
THERE ARE WAYS TO ENHANCE IT ONE

01:48:33.574 --> 01:48:37.411 region:rollup2
OF THE THINGS WE DID OUR PROCESS

01:48:35.275 --> 01:48:40.280 region:rollup2
WAS ON A WEEKLY BASIS I

01:48:37.411 --> 01:48:41.715 region:rollup2
ASSURANCE. CENTER MORLOCK WE PUT

01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:43.684 region:rollup2
TOGETHER STAFF PHONE CALLS.

01:48:41.715 --> 01:48:45.185 region:rollup2
ON A WEEKLY BASIS TO MAKE SURE

01:48:43.684 --> 01:48:46.787 region:rollup2
THAT THE ARCHITECTURAL TEAMS WAS

01:48:45.185 --> 01:48:48.122 region:rollup2
MIDDLE PICK THE BRAIN OF THE

01:48:46.787 --> 01:48:49.056 region:rollup2
TEAM ON THIS AND.

01:48:48.122 --> 01:48:50.791 region:rollup2
TWO SHORT CYCLE THINGS AS MUCH

01:48:49.056 --> 01:48:51.725 region:rollup2
AS POSSIBLE.

01:48:50.791 --> 01:48:52.926 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S SORT OF

01:48:51.725 --> 01:48:53.494 region:rollup2
THINKING WE WANTED TO

01:48:52.926 --> 01:48:54.962 region:rollup2
AGGRESSIVELY ON THE PUBLIC'S

01:48:53.494 --> 01:48:56.897 region:rollup2
BEHALF.

01:48:54.962 --> 01:48:57.865 region:rollup2
AND AND THEN YOU ARE IN CONTROL

01:48:56.897 --> 01:48:59.433 region:rollup2
YOUR SCHEDULE IF YOU'VE DONE

01:48:57.865 --> 01:49:00.334 region:rollup2
YOUR WORK UP FRONT AND YOU CAN

01:48:59.433 --> 01:49:01.969 region:rollup2
PICK THE OPPORTUNE. TIME TO

01:49:00.334 --> 01:49:03.604 region:rollup2
PROCEED

01:49:01.969 --> 01:49:04.838 region:rollup2
EARLIER BAD TURN TO SENATOR

COLLEAGUES I INQUIRED TO WITH

01:49:14.748 --> 01:49:17.584 region:rollup2
REGARD TO CHILDCARE.

01:49:15.783 --> 01:49:18.485 region:rollup2
.

01:49:17.584 --> 01:49:20.254 region:rollup2
AND I HOPE.

01:49:18.485 --> 01:49:21.755 region:rollup2
THAT A PART OF YOUR PLANNING

01:49:20.254 --> 01:49:23.323 region:rollup2
THAT THAT SOME TIME AND EFFORT

01:49:21.755 --> 01:49:24.958 region:rollup2
WILL BE SPENT.

01:49:23.323 --> 01:49:26.760 region:rollup2
IN HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:49:24.958 --> 01:49:28.529 region:rollup2
CURRENT VENDOR THEY'RE DOING AN

01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:29.296 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT OF AVAILABLE CHILD

01:49:28.529 --> 01:49:30.731 region:rollup2
CARE SLOTS.

01:49:29.296 --> 01:49:32.966 region:rollup2
FOR STATE EMPLOYEES IMMEDIATE

01:49:30.731 --> 01:49:34.968 region:rollup2
AREA I KNOW THE FACILITY CLOSE

01:49:32.966 --> 01:49:36.503 region:rollup2
FOR SOMETIME APPEARED OF TIME

01:49:34.968 --> 01:49:37.738 region:rollup2
AND I'M NOT SURE WHY IT IT SEEMS

01:49:36.503 --> 01:49:39.406 region:rollup2
TO US THAT ON THE OUTSIDE

01:49:37.738 --> 01:49:40.541 region:rollup2
LOOKING IN THAT IT'S AN OBVIOUS

01:49:39.406 --> 01:49:42.176 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WOULD BE A DEMAND.

01:49:40.541 --> 01:49:43.577 region:rollup2
I KNOW THEY HAVE A LONG WAY LESS

01:49:42.176 --> 01:49:46.280 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT.

01:49:43.577 --> 01:49:48.515 region:rollup2
SOME THOUGHT GO INTO AND AND

01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:49.283 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION DISCUSSION WITH

01:49:48.515 --> 01:49:52.553 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN THE EARLY CARE AND

01:49:49.283 --> 01:49:55.155 region:rollup2
EDUCATION PROVISION BUSINESS.

01:49:52.553 --> 01:49:56.924 region:rollup2
TO REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND

01:49:55.155 --> 01:49:58.759 region:rollup2
OF CARE WOULD BE.

01:49:56.924 --> 01:50:00.394 region:rollup2
GREATEST UTILIZED BY LEGISLATIVE

01:49:58.759 --> 01:50:02.196 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES.

01:50:00.394 --> 01:50:03.464 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW INFANT CARE S. IS

01:50:02.196 --> 01:50:04.731 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE MORE DIFFICULT

01:50:03.464 --> 01:50:06.100 region:rollup2
TO FIND.

01:50:04.731 --> 01:50:08.068 region:rollup2
IF IT'S.

01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:08.669 region:rollup2
SICK CHILD CARE GIVEN THE

01:50:08.068 --> 01:50:10.504 region:rollup2
NATURE OF OUR WORK IF THAT IS

01:50:08.669 --> 01:50:12.940 region:rollup2
IS.

01:50:10.504 --> 01:50:14.741 region:rollup2
.

01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:15.843 region:rollup2
IT IN GREATER DEMAND I JUST

01:50:14.741 --> 01:50:17.411 region:rollup2
THINK IF WE'RE GONNA INCLUDE THE

01:50:15.843 --> 01:50:18.946 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION IT SHOULD BE

01:50:17.411 --> 01:50:21.348 region:rollup2
THOUGHTFUL AND STRATEGIC AND

01:50:18.946 --> 01:50:24.151 region:rollup2
REALLY APPLY TO THE ACTUAL NEED.

01:50:21.348 --> 01:50:24.952 region:rollup2
OF STAFF AS OPPOSED TO.

01:50:24.151 --> 01:50:26.320 region:rollup2
THE BUSINESS PLAN YOU WOULD

01:50:24.952 --> 01:50:27.988 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN TO JUST BUILD A CHILD

01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:29.823 region:rollup2
CARE FACILITY THAT NEEDS GENERAL

01:50:27.988 --> 01:50:31.091 region:rollup2
LICENSING STANDARDS SO MANY

01:50:29.823 --> 01:50:33.494 region:rollup2
IMPRINT ROOMS AT FEDEX THAT ARE.

01:50:31.091 --> 01:50:35.863 region:rollup2
THE W. THIS OPPORTUNITY TO.

01:50:33.494 --> 01:50:38.332 region:rollup2
CREATE A DESIGN AND THE

01:50:35.863 --> 01:50:40.167 region:rollup2
PROVISION OF THE KIND OF CARE ON

01:50:38.332 --> 01:50:41.969 region:rollup2
THAT THE LEGISLATIVE STAFF

01:50:40.167 --> 01:50:44.505 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY NEED.

01:50:41.969 --> 01:50:45.606 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY COSTLY LA AND AND I

01:50:44.505 --> 01:50:47.608 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT.

01:50:45.606 --> 01:50:49.409 region:rollup2
.

01:50:47.608 --> 01:50:51.545 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE COSTS.

01:50:49.409 --> 01:50:52.212 region:rollup2
CHARGED BY PREVIOUS VENDORS

01:50:51.545 --> 01:50:54.214 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IT'S BEEN COST

01:50:52.212 --> 01:50:55.949 region:rollup2
PROHIBITIVE BASED ON SALARY

01:50:54.214 --> 01:50:57.150 region:rollup2
LEVELS OF PAVE HERE AT THE

01:50:55.949 --> 01:50:59.686 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS THAT WE NEED TO THINK

01:50:57.150 --> 01:51:01.155 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT TOO. I'M CURIOUS IF

01:50:59.686 --> 01:51:03.190 region:rollup2
ANY OF THE OTHER PROJECTS YOU'VE

01:51:01.155 --> 01:51:05.559 region:rollup2
BEEN INVOLVED IN HAVE INCLUDED

01:51:03.190 --> 01:51:06.894 region:rollup2
CHILDCARE FACILITIES AND WHAT

01:51:05.559 --> 01:51:07.995 region:rollup2
YOUR STRATEGY WAS IN.

01:51:06.894 --> 01:51:10.264 region:rollup2
IN BUILDING IT EXPANDED UPON

01:51:07.995 --> 01:51:11.698 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:51:10.264 --> 01:51:13.534 region:rollup2
YEAH IT'S AN INTERESTING

01:51:11.698 --> 01:51:15.102 region:rollup2
SUBJECT AND I I THINK.

01:51:13.534 --> 01:51:16.603 region:rollup2
MOST OF THE SUBJECTS ASSOCIATED

01:51:15.102 --> 01:51:18.672 region:rollup2
WITH DOING A DESIGNED FOR THIS

01:51:16.603 --> 01:51:20.073 region:rollup2
BUILDING WOULD INCLUDE.

01:51:18.672 --> 01:51:21.842 region:rollup2
A VERY DELIVERED A VERY

01:51:20.073 --> 01:51:23.810 region:rollup2
THOUGHTFUL PROCESS FOR EVERY

01:51:21.842 --> 01:51:24.678 region:rollup2
ASPECT OF INCLUDING JUST EVEN

01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:25.379 region:rollup2
HEARING ROOMS AND MEETING SPACES

01:51:24.678 --> 01:51:26.980 region:rollup2
SO.

01:51:25.379 --> 01:51:29.182 region:rollup2
EACH ONE OF THEM HAS A CERTAIN

01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:29.416 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF I GUESS ON AN EMOTIONAL

01:51:29.182 --> 01:51:31.919 region:rollup2
AND A.

01:51:29.416 --> 01:51:33.287 region:rollup2
.

01:51:31.919 --> 01:51:34.621 region:rollup2
I I GUESS A CAREFUL THOUGHT THAT

01:51:33.287 --> 01:51:37.324 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO GO ONTO I'M I THINK.

01:51:34.621 --> 01:51:38.659 region:rollup2
CHILD CARE WE HAVE TALKED.

01:51:37.324 --> 01:51:39.860 region:rollup2
WHEN WE WERE WORKING IN WYOMING

01:51:38.659 --> 01:51:41.395 region:rollup2
WE TALK THROUGH THE PROCESS OF

01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:42.729 region:rollup2
THAT IS THEY HAVE THE SAME

01:51:41.395 --> 01:51:43.797 region:rollup2
SIMILAR PROBLEM THEY HAVE A LOT

01:51:42.729 --> 01:51:45.365 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD LIKE TO

01:51:43.797 --> 01:51:47.134 region:rollup2
HAVE THEIR CHILD CARE. LOCALLY

01:51:45.365 --> 01:51:48.535 region:rollup2
CONVENIENT. GENERALLY SPEAKING

01:51:47.134 --> 01:51:49.536 region:rollup2
THESE TYPES OF BUILDINGS ARE NOT

01:51:48.535 --> 01:51:51.104 region:rollup2
CONDUCIVE CONDUCIVE TO.

01:51:49.536 --> 01:51:52.339 region:rollup2
.

01:51:51.104 --> 01:51:53.774 region:rollup2
CHILD CARE AND SO I I GUESS I

01:51:52.339 --> 01:51:55.642 region:rollup2
WOULD.

01:51:53.774 --> 01:51:57.110 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THAT IF IT WAS GOING TO.

01:51:55.642 --> 01:51:58.512 region:rollup2
.

01:51:57.110 --> 01:51:59.947 region:rollup2
THE PART OF THE PROJECT FIRST

01:51:58.512 --> 01:52:01.682 region:rollup2
AND WE LOOK AT IS IS THERE A.

01:51:59.947 --> 01:52:02.316 region:rollup2
LOCAL ADJACENT THAT IS EASIER

01:52:01.682 --> 01:52:04.251 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:52:02.316 --> 01:52:05.619 region:rollup2
CHILD CARE HAS VERY SPECIFIC

01:52:04.251 --> 01:52:07.354 region:rollup2
RULES ARE DIFFERENT THAN ON

01:52:05.619 --> 01:52:08.522 region:rollup2
OFFICE BUILDING AND SO THOSE ARE

01:52:07.354 --> 01:52:09.790 region:rollup2
SOME CONSIDERATIONS.

01:52:08.522 --> 01:52:10.924 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T MEAN IT CAN'T BE DONE

01:52:09.790 --> 01:52:14.027 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE BUILDING NOW.

01:52:10.924 --> 01:52:15.462 region:rollup2
AND SO AND IT'S IT.

01:52:14.027 --> 01:52:16.063 region:rollup2
I I BELIEVE THERE'S ACTUALLY

01:52:15.462 --> 01:52:17.231 region:rollup2
NUMBERS IN THERE RIGHT NOW FOR

01:52:16.063 --> 01:52:19.099 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT.

01:52:17.231 --> 01:52:20.400 region:rollup2
WE HAVE NOT.

01:52:19.099 --> 01:52:21.868 region:rollup2
THE LIBERTY WE HAVE RIGHT NOW AS

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:23.403 region:rollup2
WE GET TELL YOU GUYS THIS IS

01:52:21.868 --> 01:52:25.072 region:rollup2
WHAT YOUR OPTIONS ARE. AND YOU

01:52:23.403 --> 01:52:26.640 region:rollup2
GET TO TELL US IN THE FUTURE HOW

01:52:25.072 --> 01:52:28.475 region:rollup2
YOU'D LIKE TO USE THOSE OPTIONS

01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:30.244 region:rollup2
AND I I BELIEVE THAT IT'S. IT IT

01:52:28.475 --> 01:52:30.744 region:rollup2
PERFECTLY COULD FIT WITHIN WHAT

01:52:30.244 --> 01:52:32.412 region:rollup2
WE ARE.

01:52:30.744 --> 01:52:33.680 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT AS FAR SQUARE

01:52:32.412 --> 01:52:35.115 region:rollup2
FOOTAGE AND THE.

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:37.351 region:rollup2
THE THOUGHT PROCESS FOR IT IT

01:52:35.115 --> 01:52:38.685 region:rollup2
MEANS THAT YOU WOULD PROBABLY

01:52:37.351 --> 01:52:40.320 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE ON THE FIRST FLOOR.

01:52:38.685 --> 01:52:42.823 region:rollup2
OR IT COULD BE HIGHER BUT

01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:44.191 region:rollup2
GENERALLY SPEAKING THOSE SPACES

01:52:42.823 --> 01:52:46.260 region:rollup2
WHO ARE NEED TO BE ADJACENT TO

01:52:44.191 --> 01:52:46.860 region:rollup2
THE EXTERIOR EXITING SYSTEMS.

01:52:46.260 --> 01:52:47.694 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE IT'S A LOT HARDER

01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:48.829 region:rollup2
TO.

01:52:47.694 --> 01:52:50.397 region:rollup2
GET A WHOLE BUNCH OF YOUNG

01:52:48.829 --> 01:52:52.099 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OUT OF THE BUILDING BIG

01:52:50.397 --> 01:52:53.734 region:rollup2
REASONS INCLUDED. THAN IT IS TO

01:52:52.099 --> 01:52:54.935 region:rollup2
GET ADULTS ON THE BILLING SO

01:52:53.734 --> 01:52:56.870 region:rollup2
USUALLY WHAT GOES ON A LOCAL.

01:52:54.935 --> 01:52:58.972 region:rollup2
I KNOW FIRST FOUR KIND OF EXIT

01:52:56.870 --> 01:53:00.407 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE SO I I THINK IT COULD

01:52:58.972 --> 01:53:02.209 region:rollup2
EASILY ADDED AND AND I THINK

01:53:00.407 --> 01:53:04.444 region:rollup2
THAT ALL OF THE SPACES AND ALL

01:53:02.209 --> 01:53:06.580 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATION WE JUST HAD.

01:53:04.444 --> 01:53:08.615 region:rollup2
FOR REQUIRE EVERYBODY'S.

01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:11.518 region:rollup2
I I I THINK ATTENTION TO MAKE

01:53:08.615 --> 01:53:13.520 region:rollup2
SURE WE MAKE DECISIONS THAT. ARE

01:53:11.518 --> 01:53:14.955 region:rollup2
OUR DECISIONS RESERVE WERE URBAN

01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:16.456 region:rollup2
ECHO OF.

01:53:14.955 --> 01:53:17.924 region:rollup2
WELL YOU GUYS WOULD DESIRE AND

01:53:16.456 --> 01:53:18.792 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHY ALL THE WAY

01:53:17.924 --> 01:53:21.261 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR REPORT WE TALKED

01:53:18.792 --> 01:53:22.863 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT WE HEARD AND IT'S NOT

01:53:21.261 --> 01:53:24.264 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WERE GONNA. TELL YOU

01:53:22.863 --> 01:53:24.798 region:rollup2
HAVE TO DO WILL TELL YOU IF WE

01:53:24.264 --> 01:53:26.767 region:rollup2

01:53:27.401 --> 01:53:30.604 region:rollup2
OPTION WHICH.

01:53:29.369 --> 01:53:32.639 region:rollup2
I THINK THOSE ARE OWES OF.

01:53:30.604 --> 01:53:33.774 region:rollup2
ARE JOB BUT WHAT ACTUALLY GOES

01:53:32.639 --> 01:53:35.242 region:rollup2

OF A CHILD CARE FACILITY THAT

01:53:50.590 --> 01:53:53.894 region:rollup2
THERE WOULD BE AN EXTRA ELEMENT

01:53:52.192 --> 01:53:55.762 region:rollup2
OF DUE DILIGENCE THAT WOULD BE.

01:53:53.894 --> 01:53:57.364 region:rollup2
ON INCUMBENT UPON US TO ENGAGE

01:53:55.762 --> 01:53:58.799 region:rollup2

CONSTRUCTING AND RUNNING

CHILDCARE FACILITIES BECAUSE

01:54:02.469 --> 01:54:05.839 region:rollup2

FACILITY IN THE LLB AS OPPOSED

01:54:17.951 --> 01:54:20.053 region:rollup2
OTHER STATE EMPLOYEES I THINK

01:54:19.553 --> 01:54:21.021 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO DO SOME

01:54:20.053 --> 01:54:22.055 region:rollup2
HOMEWORK.

01:54:21.021 --> 01:54:24.224 region:rollup2

01:54:24.224 --> 01:54:27.561 region:rollup2
AND TO FIGURE OUT WHAT MAKES

01:54:25.392 --> 01:54:29.329 region:rollup2
SENSE FOR LEGISLATIVE EMPLOYEES

01:54:27.561 --> 01:54:30.430 region:rollup2

EXCEPT US I THINK WE HAVE TO DO

01:54:32.432 --> 01:54:34.801 region:rollup2
THAT RELIGION.

01:54:33.266 --> 01:54:36.670 region:rollup2
WELL AND I THINK THAT FITS WITH

01:54:34.801 --> 01:54:39.039 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS YOU KNOW LAST YEAR

01:54:36.670 --> 01:54:41.274 region:rollup2

GENERATION.

01:54:45.645 --> 01:54:47.748 region:rollup2
START BUILDING THE COMMON

01:54:46.646 --> 01:54:51.184 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK OF UNDERSTANDING THE

01:54:47.748 --> 01:54:53.120 region:rollup2
PROCESS THE ISSUES THAT WAS

01:54:51.184 --> 01:54:54.921 region:rollup2
MISTER HART TALKING ABOUT. OTHER

OUR STAFF DIANNE BEUERLEIN SO I

01:55:00.026 --> 01:55:02.462 region:rollup2

OF.

01:55:02.462 --> 01:55:04.698 region:rollup2
