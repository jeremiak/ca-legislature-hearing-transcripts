01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:53.982
A PROVISIONAL BALLOT IS TOTALLY

01:15:54.049 --> 01:15:55.417
DIFFERENT IN THE ENVELOPE ON A

01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:56.718
PROVISIONAL BALLOT HIS SOLE

01:15:56.785 --> 01:15:58.687
PURPOSE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:15:58.754 --> 01:16:01.189
THERE IS A MATCHING SIGNATURE ON

01:16:01.256 --> 01:16:02.624

THERE ISN'T A DOUBLE VOTE.

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:16.505
PURPOSE OF A PROVISIONAL BALLOT

01:16:16.571 --> 01:16:18.073
IS BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING NOT

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:19.441
QUITE RIGHT IN THE RECORDS OF

01:16:19.508 --> 01:16:20.976

COUNTRY DECIDED CORRECTLY SO TO

MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS NOT A

01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:25.614
BARRIER TO SOMEONE WHO'S.

01:16:25.681 --> 01:16:26.882
ENTITLED TO VOTE AND

01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:28.016
LEGITIMATELY CAN THOUGH CAN DO

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:28.884
IT THAT'S WHAT PROVISIONAL

01:16:28.951 --> 01:16:30.686
BALLOTS ARE FOR DAEGU THROUGH A

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:32.120
VERY DIFFERENT LEVEL OF SCRUTINY

01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:33.922
IN THE REGISTRAR'S OFFICE AND

01:16:33.989 --> 01:16:36.591
RIGHTLY SO WE NEED TO KEEP THESE.

01:16:36.658 --> 01:16:38.260
TWO OF FORMS AND PROCESSES

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:39.728
TOTALLY SEPARATE.

01:16:39.795 --> 01:16:40.996
AND IN THE FINAL POINT IS

01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:42.064
THERE'S ERROR.

01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:43.231
THERE'S AIR ALL THE TIMES IN

01:16:43.298 --> 01:16:44.499
REGISTRAR'S OFFICE NOT

01:16:44.566 --> 01:16:46.068
NECESSARILY FRAUD BUT ERROR THAT

01:16:46.134 --> 01:16:48.203
HAPPENS AND REMOVING THE ABILITY

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:49.638
TO HAVE TWO SEPARATE LEVELS OF

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:50.872
SCRUTINY ON WHETHER VOTER

01:16:50.939 --> 01:16:52.474
REGISTRATION IS LEGITIMATE.

01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:53.976
OR PROVISIONAL VOTE CAST IS

01:16:54.042 --> 01:16:55.310
LEGITIMATE COMBINING THEM

01:16:55.377 --> 01:16:56.778
TOGETHER INCREASES THE

01:16:56.845 --> 01:16:57.913
LIKELIHOOD OF ERROR.

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.983
R. VOTE IS TO SACROSANCT. TO

01:17:01.049 --> 01:17:02.751

THIS PROCESS AND I KNOW THAT I

01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:23.017
HAVE A LARGE CONTINGENT OF YOUNG

01:35:23.084 --> 01:35:25.019
PEOPLE FROM STOCKTON WHO --

01:35:25.086 --> 01:35:26.620
WERE ORGANIZING TO PUT A SUGAR

01:35:26.687 --> 01:35:28.422
TAX ON OUR BALLOT AND HAVE COME

01:35:28.489 --> 01:35:29.723

01:35:31.392 --> 01:35:33.327
MET BEFORE.

01:35:33.394 --> 01:35:34.328
SO I WOULD SAY TO THEM I WOULD

01:35:34.395 --> 01:35:35.763
SAY TO EVERYBODY.

01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:37.431
THAT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO LOOK

01:35:37.498 --> 01:35:39.100
AT THE THE LONG GAME AND WHILE

01:35:39.166 --> 01:35:41.202
IT IS A VERY CLEAR EXAMPLE TODAY

01:35:41.268 --> 01:35:43.070
WE SEE OF WHAT DEEP POCKETS CAN

01:35:43.137 --> 01:35:45.206
DO TO OUR DEMOCRACY.

01:35:45.272 --> 01:35:46.941
AND WE SEE TODAY THAT WE ARE

01:35:47.007 --> 01:35:49.110
TAKING A PAUSE IN THE BATTLE

01:35:49.176 --> 01:35:50.711
AGAINST OBESITY.

01:35:50.778 --> 01:35:52.246
BUT IT'S JUST A PAUSE.

01:35:52.313 --> 01:35:54.548
AND THE FIGHT GOES ON AND THE

01:35:54.615 --> 01:35:56.283
MORE THAT WE HEAR THE YOUNG

01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:57.885

01:35:57.952 --> 01:35:59.120
IS TODAY WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS A

01:35:59.186 --> 01:36:02.723
VERY TOP HEAVY DOWN A CORPORATE.

01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:04.592
PUSH DOWN ON DEMOCRACY.

01:36:04.658 --> 01:36:05.926
BUT FOR EVERY ACTION THERE IS A

01:36:05.993 --> 01:36:07.695
REACTION.

01:36:07.761 --> 01:36:08.696

01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:10.891
WHEN I WAS IN THE CITY COUNCIL

01:42:10.958 --> 01:42:13.026
THE CITY OF HEALDSBURG?

01:42:13.093 --> 01:42:14.962
AS THE MAYOR WE WERE THE FIRST

01:42:15.028 --> 01:42:16.563
CITY IN THE STATE TO TRY TO

01:42:16.630 --> 01:42:20.501

01:42:21.702 --> 01:42:23.570
WE FOUND OUT.

01:42:23.637 --> 01:42:24.438
THAT WE COULDN'T DO THAT

01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:24.738
[inaudible]

01:42:24.805 --> 01:42:27.374
BECAUSE STATE LAW PREEMPTED US

01:42:27.441 --> 01:42:29.309
FROM DOING THAT.

01:42:29.376 --> 01:42:30.577
NOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

01:42:30.644 --> 01:42:32.145
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA

01:42:32.212 --> 01:42:33.146
JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE

01:42:33.213 --> 01:42:35.382
UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN RAISING

01:42:35.449 --> 01:42:37.017
MONEY.

01:42:37.084 --> 01:42:40.320
AND FIGHTING FIRST FOR SO TAXES.

01:42:40.387 --> 01:42:41.989
IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN IT

01:42:42.055 --> 01:42:43.590
STARTED TO WORK.

01:42:43.657 --> 01:42:45.792
AND GUESS WHAT.

01:42:45.859 --> 01:42:48.629
ASSUMPTION IS GOING DOWN.

01:42:48.695 --> 01:42:51.331
AND IT'S TERRIFIED THE INDUSTRY.

01:42:51.398 --> 01:42:54.001
SO WHAT THIS MEASURE DIES.

01:42:54.067 --> 01:42:55.435
IS IT BRINGS FULL CIRCLE IT

01:42:55.502 --> 01:42:58.572
BRAINS THAT ISSUE BACK TO THIS

01:42:58.639 --> 01:43:00.474
BODY TAKES IT OUT OF THE HANDS

01:43:00.541 --> 01:43:01.875
THE LOCALS.

01:43:01.942 --> 01:43:02.709
WE'RE CREATING THE NEW TOBACCO

IT'S CALLED THE SODA INDUSTRY.

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:08.048
EVERYTHING'S GONNA HAVE TO GO TO

01:43:08.115 --> 01:43:09.550
HEAR SO NOT ONLY ARE THEY GOING

01:43:09.616 --> 01:43:10.817
TO CONTINUE TO MAKE OUTRAGEOUS

01:43:10.884 --> 01:43:12.185
PROFITS BECAUSE IT'S A VERY

01:43:12.252 --> 01:43:13.987
PROFITABLE INDUSTRY.

01:43:14.054 --> 01:43:14.721
BUT THERE GONNA BE OTHER

01:43:14.788 --> 01:43:16.590
CONCENTRATE ALL THEIR RESOURCES

01:43:16.657 --> 01:43:18.625

01:43:28.936 --> 01:43:30.904
AND YET.

01:43:30.971 --> 01:43:33.774
WE'RE PERPETUATING THAT.

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:36.410
WE CAN'T GET THE MONEY WE NEED.

01:43:36.476 --> 01:43:39.613
THROUGH ART PROCESS. TO GIVE

01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:41.014

THEY MAY WIN THE BATTLE TODAY

01:43:58.865 --> 01:44:02.402
BUT THEY WILL NOT WIN THE WAR.

01:44:02.469 --> 01:44:03.737
CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR YOU

01:44:03.804 --> 01:44:06.106

01:55:42.969 --> 01:55:44.370
COST OF LIVING.

01:55:44.437 --> 01:55:46.739
GET OUR FAMILIES OUT OF THIS 24%

01:55:46.806 --> 01:55:48.141
POVERTY AND GIVE THEM THE

01:55:48.207 --> 01:55:49.876
ABILITY TO HAVE THAT QUALITY

01:55:49.942 --> 01:55:51.411

SHARING.

THEIR PERSPECTIVES IN THEIR

01:56:11.464 --> 01:56:13.366
OPINIONS AND THEIR FRUSTRATIONS --

01:56:13.433 --> 01:56:14.967
WITH WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY AND

01:56:15.034 --> 01:56:15.635
AND THE POSITION THAT WE'RE ALL

01:56:15.702 --> 01:56:17.337
IN YOU KNOW WHEN I FIRST RAN FOR

01:56:17.403 --> 01:56:19.539
OFFICE STARTED MY CAMPAIGN WAS

01:56:19.605 --> 01:56:20.139
TWENTY FIVE WHEN I GOT ELECTED

01:56:20.206 --> 01:56:21.274
AT TWENTY SEVEN WHEN I GOT

01:56:21.341 --> 01:56:22.542
ELECTED I THINK WE ALL.

01:56:22.608 --> 01:56:24.377
GET ELECTED WITH THIS THE SAME

01:56:24.444 --> 01:56:25.445
IDEA WE JUST WANT TO COME UP

01:56:25.511 --> 01:56:27.680
HERE TO DO SOME GOOD. TO COME UP

01:56:27.747 --> 01:56:28.815
HERE TO MAKE PEOPLE'S LIVES A

01:56:28.881 --> 01:56:30.450
LITTLE BIT BETTER TO MAKE SURE

01:56:30.516 --> 01:56:31.551
THAT WE'RE REPRESENTING OUR

01:56:31.617 --> 01:56:32.685
CONSTITUENTS THE WAY THAT THEY

01:56:32.752 --> 01:56:34.187
DESERVE TO BE REPRESENTED.

01:56:34.253 --> 01:56:35.688
A PART OF DOING THAT JOB IS

01:56:35.755 --> 01:56:37.990
MAKING DIFFICULT DECISIONS.

01:56:38.057 --> 01:56:39.359
AND WHAT WE'RE FACED WITH TODAY

01:56:39.425 --> 01:56:40.393
IS A DIFFICULT DECISION

01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:40.693
[inaudible]

01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:43.629
AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE

01:56:43.696 --> 01:56:45.264
PROCESS WE CAN TALK ABOUT

01:56:45.331 --> 01:56:46.432
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT BUT

01:56:46.499 --> 01:56:47.834
IT'S THE POSITION THAT WE'RE IN

01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:49.769
BECAUSE OF THE LAWS THAT WE HAVE.

01:56:49.836 --> 01:56:52.004
AND IT'S TRUE AND THE STATE OF

01:56:52.071 --> 01:56:54.540
CALIFORNIA ANYBODY IN THIS STATE

01:56:54.607 --> 01:56:56.409
WHETHER THEY'RE HERE OR THERE

01:56:56.476 --> 01:56:57.844
OUT OF STATE AS LONG AS THEY

01:56:57.910 --> 01:56:59.379
HAVE ENOUGH MONEY THEY CAN HIRE

01:56:59.445 --> 01:57:00.680
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE TO COLLECT A

01:57:00.747 --> 01:57:01.914
BUNCH OF SIGNATURES AND PUT

01:57:01.981 --> 01:57:03.116
SOMETHING ON OUR BALLOT.

01:57:03.182 --> 01:57:05.618
THAT FORCES ARE HAND AT TIMES OR

01:57:05.685 --> 01:57:07.286
PUTS US IN A POSITION.

01:57:07.353 --> 01:57:09.489
WELL WE HAVE TO MAKE THESE TYPES

01:57:09.555 --> 01:57:11.958
OF CHOICES OR THEY MISINFORM THE

01:57:12.024 --> 01:57:13.926
VOTERS TO MAKE A DECISION THAT

01:57:13.993 --> 01:57:16.996
ULTIMATELY IS POOR FOR THEM.

01:57:17.063 --> 01:57:18.264
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS WE'RE

01:57:18.331 --> 01:57:19.065
TRYING TO SAVE OUR LOCAL

01:57:19.132 --> 01:57:21.467
GOVERNMENTS WERE TRYING TO PUT

01:57:21.534 --> 01:57:22.702
THEM IN A POSITION SO THAT THEY

01:57:22.769 --> 01:57:25.104
CAN PROVIDE THE RESOURCES THAT

01:57:25.171 --> 01:57:26.005
THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE?

01:57:26.072 --> 01:57:28.474
BY THE CAN. TO SERVE THE

01:57:28.541 --> 01:57:29.842
CONSTITUENTS THAT ELECTED THEM

01:57:29.909 --> 01:57:31.477
TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.

01:57:31.544 --> 01:57:33.479
BUT THE REAL PROBLEM HERE.

01:57:33.546 --> 01:57:35.448
IS THIS INITIATIVE PROCESS AND I

01:57:35.515 --> 01:57:36.582
THINK THAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING

01:57:36.649 --> 01:57:38.317
HERE TODAY.

01:57:38.384 --> 01:57:40.686
IS A WHOLE BUNCH OF MY MEMBERS

01:57:40.753 --> 01:57:41.621
THAT ARE UPSET WITH THE POSITION

01:57:41.687 --> 01:57:42.922
THAT WHAT THE WHAT THE SITUATION

01:57:42.989 --> 01:57:44.824
THAT WE HAVE THAT SHOULD BE

01:57:44.891 --> 01:57:46.459
READY TO COMMIT TO REFORMING.

01:57:46.526 --> 01:57:48.761
THAT INITIATIVE PROCESS THAT'S

01:57:48.828 --> 01:57:50.496
WHAT WE NEED TO COMMIT TO DO.

01:57:50.563 --> 01:57:51.731
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW

01:57:51.798 --> 01:57:53.065
WHAT THE INITIATIVE PROCESS IS

01:57:53.132 --> 01:57:54.434
TO US AND AS LEGISLATORS IN THIS

01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:55.701
BODY.

01:57:55.768 --> 01:57:57.036
IT'S EVERY TIME SOMETHING GETS

01:57:57.103 --> 01:57:58.671
PASS ON THAT BALLOT.

01:57:58.738 --> 01:58:01.174
IT HAMSTRINGS US IN A PUTS US

01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:02.542
INTO AN AWKWARD AND UNFORTUNATE

01:58:02.608 --> 01:58:04.210
POSITION IMAGINE YOUR BUILDER

01:58:04.277 --> 01:58:06.145
YOU WANT TO BUILD A HOUSE.

01:58:06.212 --> 01:58:07.346
AND WHEN I SAY I WANT MY HOUSE

01:58:07.413 --> 01:58:08.714
BUILT IN TWO WEEKS THIS IS WHAT

01:58:08.781 --> 01:58:09.949
I WANT TO LOOK LIKE AND I

01:58:10.016 --> 01:58:11.617
EXPLAINED EVERYTHING.

01:58:11.684 --> 01:58:12.819
AND SO YOU HAD THOSE TWO WEEKS

01:58:12.885 --> 01:58:14.587
BEFORE I LEAVE I TAKE YOUR TOOLS

01:58:14.654 --> 01:58:15.788
ANTI ONE OF YOUR HANDS BEHIND

01:58:15.855 --> 01:58:17.557
YOUR BACK.

01:58:17.623 --> 01:58:18.925
STILL HAVE THE SAME TIMELINE NOW

01:58:18.991 --> 01:58:19.792
YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR TOOLS THE

01:58:19.859 --> 01:58:20.993
ONLY HAVE ONE HAND TO DO IT

01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:22.528
THAT'S THE INITIATIVE PROCESS IN

01:58:22.595 --> 01:58:23.729
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

01:58:23.796 --> 01:58:25.131
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS OF THIS

01:58:25.198 --> 01:58:26.732
LEGISLATURE WE ARE BEING.

01:58:26.799 --> 01:58:28.668
HAMSTRING FROM BEING ABLE TO DO

01:58:28.734 --> 01:58:30.036
OUR JOB BY THIS INITIATIVE

01:58:30.102 --> 01:58:31.304
PROCESS AND IT SHOULD BE A

01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:33.406
LESSON TO EVERYBODY THAT GETS

01:58:33.473 --> 01:58:34.607
APPROACHED BY SOMEONE TO SIGN AN

01:58:34.674 --> 01:58:36.709
INITIATIVE.

01:58:36.776 --> 01:58:37.743
PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU'RE

01:58:37.810 --> 01:58:39.545
CITING.

01:58:39.612 --> 01:58:41.481
READ WHAT YOU'RE SIGNING DON'T

01:58:41.547 --> 01:58:43.082

FACE VALUE BECAUSE A LOTTA TIMES

01:58:44.650 --> 01:58:45.651
IF NOT TRUE.

01:58:45.718 --> 01:58:47.520
IT IS NOT A LIE OR TO DISK

01:58:47.587 --> 01:58:49.055
DISTORTION.

01:58:49.121 --> 01:58:50.990
OF WHAT YOU'RE BEING TOLD BUT

01:58:51.057 --> 01:58:51.791
ULTIMATELY WHAT WE FACE HERE

01:58:51.858 --> 01:58:52.725
TODAY.

01:58:52.792 --> 01:58:53.926
IS A DECISION THAT WE HAVE TO

01:58:53.993 --> 01:58:57.363
MAKE ON AN ISSUE THAT IS POLLING.

01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:59.365
AND IT RAINS THAT COULD PASS

01:58:59.432 --> 01:59:01.467
BECAUSE THERE IS NO OPPOSITION

01:59:01.534 --> 01:59:02.702
THAT HAS ENOUGH RESOURCES TO

01:59:02.768 --> 01:59:05.638
FIGHT IT BACK SO WE LET THIS GO

01:59:05.705 --> 01:59:06.472

HAMSTRING FURTHER.

01:59:14.113 --> 01:59:16.115
MUCH FURTHER THAN THEY WOULD BE

01:59:16.182 --> 01:59:17.750
HAMSTRING IT BY PASSING NESS BUT

01:59:17.817 --> 01:59:18.751
THIS ALSO NOW PUTS THE ONUS ON

01:59:18.818 --> 01:59:20.620

IT'S TIME FOR US TO STAND UP.

01:59:23.089 --> 01:59:24.357
IT'S TIME FOR US TO MAKE THIS

01:59:24.423 --> 01:59:26.592
DECISION THIS INDUSTRY WANTED US

BE THE ONES TO MAKE THE DECISION

01:59:31.531 --> 01:59:32.565
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT.

01:59:32.632 --> 01:59:33.499
WE HAVE A SODA TAX IN THIS

01:59:33.566 --> 01:59:35.167
INDUSTRY WHY THINK IT'S NOW TIME

01:59:35.234 --> 01:59:36.469
TO CALL THEM ON IT AND WE BETTER

01:59:36.536 --> 01:59:38.271
COME BACK NEXT YEAR AND HOLD ON

01:59:38.337 --> 01:59:40.606

HERE TO DO IS TO DO THE RIGHT

01:59:46.312 --> 01:59:46.846
THING.

01:59:46.913 --> 01:59:48.314
AND NOW IT'S PRETTY CLEAR WHAT

01:59:48.381 --> 01:59:49.949

INSTEAD I AM TIRED.

02:00:03.729 --> 02:00:05.197
OF THE BASHING OF THE BALLOT

02:00:05.264 --> 02:00:06.365
INITIATIVE PROCESS HERE IN THIS

02:00:06.432 --> 02:00:08.134
CHAMBER.

02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:10.336
THE BALLOT INITIATIVE PROCESS

02:00:10.403 --> 02:00:12.371
WAS INTENDED.

02:00:12.438 --> 02:00:14.173
BYPASS A CORRUPTED STATE

02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:16.075
LEGISLATURE.

02:00:16.142 --> 02:00:17.910
THE WHOLE POINT OF THE BALLOT

02:00:17.977 --> 02:00:20.379
INITIATIVE IS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

02:00:20.446 --> 02:00:22.782
THE PEOPLE DIRECTLY VOTE ON

02:00:22.848 --> 02:00:24.350
ISSUES [inaudible]

02:00:24.417 --> 02:00:26.319
WITH OUT.

02:00:26.385 --> 02:00:27.687
HAVING THIS BODY INTERFERING

02:00:27.753 --> 02:00:30.089
WITH IT.

02:00:30.156 --> 02:00:32.124
AND I WANT TO AVOID SITUATIONS

02:00:32.191 --> 02:00:34.260
IN THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE.

02:00:34.327 --> 02:00:35.761
AS WELL AS PEOPLE WHO WANT TO

02:00:35.828 --> 02:00:37.196
WOULD WANT TO QUOTE REFORM IT

02:00:37.263 --> 02:00:39.398
WHICH REALLY MEANS TO HAMSTRING

02:00:39.465 --> 02:00:41.334
THE BALLOT ISSUE PROCESS WE

02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:42.935
ALREADY HAVE IT SET THE BALLOT

02:00:43.002 --> 02:00:43.869
INITIATIVES BUT FOR BY THE

02:00:43.936 --> 02:00:44.670
CITIZENS.

02:00:44.737 --> 02:00:45.905
ARE PUSH IN THE GENERAL ELECTION

02:00:45.972 --> 02:00:47.740
BALLOT RATHER THAN THE PRIMARY

02:00:47.807 --> 02:00:48.608
ELECTION BALLOT IN A WHOLE

02:00:48.674 --> 02:00:50.576
SERIES OF OTHER LAWS BY THE

02:00:50.643 --> 02:00:52.545
STATE LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO

02:00:52.612 --> 02:00:53.946
HAMSTRING IT.

02:00:54.013 --> 02:00:55.481
AND TO TRY TO OBSTRUCT IT.

02:00:55.548 --> 02:00:56.816
WHICH I BELIEVE IS ABSOLUTELY

02:00:56.882 --> 02:00:58.250
WRONG WE NEED TO BE PROTECTORS

02:00:58.317 --> 02:00:59.619
OF THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE

02:00:59.685 --> 02:01:01.587
PROTECTORS OF THE VOTERS.

02:01:01.654 --> 02:01:02.421
NOT OBSTRUCT ERRORS OF THE

02:01:02.488 --> 02:01:04.223
VOTERS.

02:01:04.290 --> 02:01:05.591
NOW I HEARD THE MEMBER FROM SAN

02:01:05.658 --> 02:01:08.194
JOSE TALK ABOUT THIS PROCESS IS

02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:10.663
BEING A SHAKEDOWN IF YOU WILL

02:01:10.730 --> 02:01:12.198
NOT FIND IT COMICAL.

02:01:12.264 --> 02:01:13.599
THEY'RE TRYING TO AVOID BEING

02:01:13.666 --> 02:01:15.701
OVERTAXED IS CONSIDERED A

02:01:15.768 --> 02:01:16.969
SHAKEDOWN BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE

02:01:17.036 --> 02:01:19.005
LEGISLATURE BUT THAT'S JUST THE

02:01:19.071 --> 02:01:20.406
GENERAL NATURE OF THIS

02:01:20.473 --> 02:01:21.540
POPULATION THAT SEATED AND IF IN

02:01:21.607 --> 02:01:24.944
THIS BODY.

02:01:25.011 --> 02:01:25.811
BUT IF YOU BELIEVE IT'S A

02:01:25.878 --> 02:01:27.413
SHAKEDOWN IF YOU BELIEVE IT'S A

02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:28.314
CORRUPTION YOU DO HAVE AN

02:01:28.381 --> 02:01:31.283
OPPORTUNITY.

02:03:52.358 --> 02:03:54.527
HOWEVER.

02:03:54.593 --> 02:03:56.729
AS THE ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS

02:03:56.796 --> 02:03:59.131

BEING OBESE.

02:04:05.004 --> 02:04:05.504
THERE ARE GOOD SCIENTIFIC

02:04:05.571 --> 02:04:07.706
REASONS FOR THIS.

02:04:07.773 --> 02:04:08.841
WHEN YOU TAKE CARE AND AND

02:04:08.908 --> 02:04:10.776

LET'S GIVE ASSUME INSULIN.

02:04:19.084 --> 02:04:20.586
THAT INSULIN ISN'T NEEDED IT CAN

02:04:20.653 --> 02:04:23.122
LEAD TO INSULIN RESISTANCE.

02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:27.259
IT CAN ALSO LEAD. TO OBESITY

02:04:27.326 --> 02:04:28.828

SO IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A TAX

02:04:37.503 --> 02:04:39.305
IT SHOULD BE ON ALL THESE THINGS

02:04:39.371 --> 02:04:40.673

TO AGREE WITH ME ON THIS BUT

02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:01.927
THERE'S GOOD SCIENCE BEHIND IT.

02:05:01.994 --> 02:05:04.029
AND FURTHER.

02:05:04.096 --> 02:05:05.364
THE USE OF ARTIFICIALLY

02:05:07.466 --> 02:05:08.834

YOU TAKE THIS OFF THE BALLOT

02:07:04.316 --> 02:07:05.985
WHICH WOULD DENY THE ABILITY OF

02:07:06.051 --> 02:07:07.786
CALIFORNIANS TO STOP TAX

02:07:07.853 --> 02:07:09.989

ANYTHING THIS LEGISLATURE GIVES

02:07:25.871 --> 02:07:27.840

RIGHT TO REQUEST THAT A BUSINESS

SO WHY DO WE TAKE ON SUCH A BIG

02:17:07.586 --> 02:17:09.087

DIGITAL PRIVACY IS A

02:18:10.849 --> 02:18:12.550
TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT ONE AND

02:18:12.617 --> 02:18:13.151
IT WILL BECOME.

02:18:13.218 --> 02:18:15.286
EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IN THE

02:18:15.353 --> 02:18:17.522
DECADES TO COME WHEN THE VARIETY

02:18:17.589 --> 02:18:18.657
OF INFORMATION THAT'S COLLECTED

02:18:18.723 --> 02:18:20.358

02:18:23.895 --> 02:18:24.896
APPROPRIATE THE CALIFORNIA'S

02:18:24.963 --> 02:18:26.598

02:18:26.665 --> 02:18:27.365
ISSUE.

02:18:27.432 --> 02:18:29.834
AS THE CRUCIBLE OF COMPANIES

02:18:29.901 --> 02:18:30.702
THAT SPECIALIZE IN THE

02:18:30.769 --> 02:18:32.170

I THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY

02:18:34.673 --> 02:18:37.142
TO LEAD.

02:18:37.208 --> 02:18:39.411
THE EXAMINATION OF THIS ISSUE.

02:18:39.477 --> 02:18:41.413
I ALSO FEEL THAT HERE IN THE

02:18:42.947 --> 02:18:45.050
VENUE FOR THIS DEBATE.

02:18:45.116 --> 02:18:46.584
I THINK WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB

02:18:46.651 --> 02:18:47.919
OF BALANCING THE TRADE OFFS

02:18:47.986 --> 02:18:49.020
BETWEEN PROTECTING DIGITAL

02:18:50.455 --> 02:18:52.190
ENCOURAGING COMMERCE ON THE

02:18:52.257 --> 02:18:52.424

THROUGH A LEGISLATIVE PROCESS

02:18:54.159 --> 02:18:54.659
THEN THROUGH THE INITIATIVE

02:18:54.726 --> 02:18:55.827
PROCESS.

02:18:55.894 --> 02:18:57.562
AND IF YOU WANT PROOF OF HOW

02:18:57.629 --> 02:18:59.397
MUCH PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE ON

02:18:59.464 --> 02:19:00.465
THIS ISSUE.

02:19:00.532 --> 02:19:02.367
LOOK AT THE INITIATIVE THAT THIS

02:19:02.434 --> 02:19:04.135
ISSUE THAT THIS BILL MS METRO

02:19:04.202 --> 02:19:06.171
REPLACE THE INITIATIVES ABOUT

TWO PAGES LONG THIS BILL IS

02:19:07.572 --> 02:19:09.340
ALMOST TWENTY PAGES LONG.

02:19:09.407 --> 02:19:10.108
SO WE HAVE MADE A TREMENDOUS

02:19:10.175 --> 02:19:11.376
AMOUNT OF PROGRESS NO ONE I

02:19:11.443 --> 02:19:12.744

STAKEHOLDERSFOR WORKING SO HARD

02:19:14.345 --> 02:19:15.313

02:19:15.380 --> 02:19:17.082
OF WEEKS.

02:19:17.148 --> 02:19:18.483
NOW HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT.

02:19:18.550 --> 02:19:19.417
IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT

02:19:19.484 --> 02:19:20.919
FRUSTRATING FOR ME.

02:19:20.985 --> 02:19:22.353
THE PROCESS THAT'S BEEN FOLLOWED

02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:23.822
HERE BECAUSE IT IS BEEN AN

02:19:23.888 --> 02:19:25.490
ABBREVIATED PROCESS ABBREVIATED

02:19:25.557 --> 02:19:27.258

02:19:31.763 --> 02:19:32.997
I STILL HAVE SOME SERIOUS

02:19:33.064 --> 02:19:34.766
CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL.

02:19:34.833 --> 02:19:36.301
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRIVATE

02:19:36.367 --> 02:19:38.369
RIGHT OF ACTION IN THE BILL.

02:19:38.436 --> 02:19:40.271
BEING USED FOR PURPOSES BEYOND

02:19:43.575 --> 02:19:44.442
TAKEN UP.

02:19:44.509 --> 02:19:45.910

02:19:49.814 --> 02:19:50.815
POTENTIAL UNINTENDED

02:19:50.882 --> 02:19:52.217
CONSEQUENCES OF THE BILL SO IT'S

02:19:52.283 --> 02:19:54.052
CLEAR THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEEDS

02:19:54.119 --> 02:19:55.019

AND NOT INCLUSIVE.

02:28:00.738 --> 02:28:02.006
I'M THE FIRST ONE TO ADMIT THAT

02:28:02.073 --> 02:28:03.541
THE PROCESS COULD BE BETTER IF

02:28:03.608 --> 02:28:05.276

THE BILL MAY NOT BE PERFECT AND

02:28:19.624 --> 02:28:20.491
