WAITING FOR A QUORUM AND WE WILL HEAR CENTER OWNS BILL. AND WAITING. WE WANT TO HAVE A COUPLE A COUPLE OF RAIN. IT'S JUST A COUPLE RAIN. IT'S ALL RIGHT. WE WILL WE WILL. BEGIN THE MEETING AND OPERATE AS A SUB COMMITTEE UNTIL WE REACH A QUORUM THERE WILL VOTE ON TWO THINGS- WE WILL VOTE ON ITEM NUMBER TWO CENTER ALAN'S BILL IS SB SEVEN FIFTY SEVEN. AND THEN WE HAVE THREE ITEMS ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR I WILL VOTE ON THOSE SO. AT THIS POINT. WE'D LIKE TO. OUR FIRST SET AROUND THE FLOOR AND HE CAN PRESENT HIS BILL AT THIS TIME CENTER. THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE TECHNICAL MOMENT IT'S OUTLINED IN COMMENT SIX OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. OF THIS BILL SB SEVENTY SEVEN IS AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE MODEST REFORMS TO THE STATE HIGHWAY RELINQUISHMENT PROCESS IN THE HOPES OF MAKING IT EASIER FOR LOSS OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. WHO DESIRE TO MANAGE TO MAKE CHANGES TO A PORTION OF A ROAD THAT NO LONGER SERVES. THE PURPOSE OF A TYPICAL STATE HIGHWAY HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY AS LONG AS THERE'S- A STRONG PROCESS IT'S FOLLOWED AND- AND YOU KNOW THE STATE. I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO THE BILL PROPOSES AN ALTERNATIVE PROCESS THAT WOULD PERMIT. THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION TO RELINQUISH PORTIONS OF THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM TO EXCEED YOUR COUNTY- WITHOUT EXPLICIT. LEGISLATIVE ACTION- NOW MY INTENTION IS NOT TO FACILITATE ANY ABDICATION OF CALIFORNIA'S HIGHWAY SYSTEM TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. HI AND SHOULD THE BILL MOVE FOR TODAY I'M VERY COMMITTED TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUING- YEAH SOME OF THE FOLKS AT TEN REPRESENTS- WHO WANT GREATER PARAMETERS AROUND THE SCOPE OF SECTIONS OF HIGHWAYS THAT COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR A LINK WHICH MEANT WITHOUT- EXPLICIT LEGISLATIVE CONSENT. AND ALSO I WANT TO MENTION THAT IT CENTER RUBIO'S. REQUEST I WILL SPECIFICALLY AMEND THE BILL. TO RESTRICT ANY PORTION OF THE SEVEN TEN. SOUTHERN STUB THAT- THAT TERMINATES IN HER DISTRICT FROM BEING RELINQUISH WITHOUT THE LISTENERS APPROVAL BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROVERSIES BETWEEN THE VERY CITIES AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT THE REGIONAL CONCERNS ARE BEING TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THERE- SO FOR. BUT BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE IDEA HERE IS THAT FOR THOSE APPROPRIATE INSTANCES. WHERE IT'S NOT PRACTICABLE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO WORK THROUGH OUR STATE BUREAUCRACY TO MANAGER MAKE IMPORTANT CHANGES TO LOCAL ROADS- THIS BILL WILL MAKE A MODEST BUT IN. REPORT IMPROVEMENTS CURRENT LAW CREATED A TRANSPARENT SYSTEM- THAT- THAT THERE WILL BE LESS BUREAUCRATIC THAN THE CURRENT SYSTEM. AND ALLOW FOR THERE TO BE SOME MORE COHERENCE AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR VOTE. THE USER OF THIS ORDER REFER. THANK. THANK FAVOR OF. TEMPERAMENT INTERNATIONAL OPERATING JUNIORS WE THAT YOU KNOW WE REPRESENT THE CALTRANS MAINTENANCE WORKERS WHO DO MAINTENANCE ON THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. THEN CURRENT LAW REQUIRES ON RELINQUISHMENT AT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED- THAT THAT APPROVAL PROCESS GIVES US SOME INPUT IN THE RELINQUISHMENT PROCESS. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN RELINQUISHMENT- HER TERM MEMBERS IN THEIR TIME SO IT DOES NOT- BUT THIS BILL IN FORTY TAKES THAT IN PUT AWAY FROM US. SO I'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS AUTHORS OFFICER THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND STAFF OF A COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH US. TO CONTINUE TO CRAFT WAY TO GIVE US SOME INPUT ON RELINQUISHMENT PROCESS IF THE LEGISLATURE'S. NOT CAN OFFER OVERSIGHT WE'RE LOOKING FOR A PLACE SOMEWHERE TO HAVE OVERSIGHT AND ADDRESS CONCERNS IF WE HAVE THEM. AND I AND I WE DO AGREE TO OFFER THE NOTION THAT ELECTION PROCESS SHOULD BE STREAMLINED- AND THERE SHOULD BE SOME. RATIONALE TO IT AS OPPOSED TO A HAPHAZARD APPROVAL PROCESS- BUT WE ARE LOOKING TO FOR SOME WAY TO GIVE INPUT IF WE NEED TO FOR MEMBERS ARE DISPLACED FROM THAT WORK. AND MAYBE HAVE SOME NEGOTIATIONS WITH CALTRANS ON THAT ANY I THINK THE AUTHOR HAS. COMMITTED. AT LEAST HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH US MOVING FORWARD ON THAT. AND I THINK THE WAY WHERE WE HAD TO INTRODUCE A BILL TACK TRUE RELINQUISH THE STATE HIGHWAY.
