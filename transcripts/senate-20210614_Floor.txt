A FAMILY BILL ONE TWENTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER TANG AN ACT RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BUDGET BELL. CENTERS SKINNER THANK YOU MEMBERS EIGHTY ONE TWENTY EIGHT IS THE BUDGET BILL FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR. AND IT IS THE RESULT OF A LOT OF HARD WORK SINCE JANUARY I THINK- THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE OR WHO MAY HAVE OBSERVED SOME OF THE BUDGET HEARINGS. THEY HAVE BEEN- THOROUGH THERE BEEN MANY STAKEHOLDERS AND PUBLIC INVOLVED VETTING PROPOSALS AND OF COURSE- INTRODUCING PROPOSALS SO REALLY WANT TO GIVE MY APPRECIATION TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF AND OF COURSE ALL OF YOU WHO ALSO. GIVE YOUR INPUT IN THIS AND OF COURSE THE PUBLIC. WITH THE DECADE OF RESPONSIBLE BUDGET ACTIONS BY THE LEGISLATURE THEREOF IS STUCK IN THE PUBLIC BENEFITS DEVILISH VARIOUS RESERVES AND OTHER ACTIONS ALONG WITH ROBUST FEDERAL STIMULUS CALIFORNIA WAS ABLE TO WEATHER THE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS WITHOUT MAKING. BUDGET CUTS AND YOU CAN RECALL LAST YEAR WE THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN REVENUES AND SO WE PREPARED AND WE PUT WE MADE SOME CUTS WE PUT IN SOME A TRUCKER CATCH BUT WE WERE NOT. WE WERE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THOSE AND SO THOSE ARE RESTORED IN THIS BUDGET AND HAVE BEEN IN SOME CASES OVER THE COURSE OF OUR EARLY ACTIONS. BUT WHAT WE FACE TODAY IS THAT WE ARE IN AN UNPRECEDENTED POSITION TO MAKE TRANSFORMATIVE INVESTMENTS. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BUDGET BILL DOES IT IS A BUDGET BASED ON THE L. E. O.'S REVENUES WHICH AS WE HEARD THIS MORNING IN COMMITTEE. INCORPORATE REVENUES THAT HAVE COME IN THAT CAME IN TOO LATE TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE MAY REVISE. EIGHTY ONE TWENTY EIGHT INCLUDES MUCH OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S MAY REVISE PROPOSALS ALONG WITH PRIORITIES OF THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE TRANSFORMATIVE INVESTMENTS AS I MENTIONED THAT WILL IMPROVE THE LIVES OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. WINDOWS INCLUDES. INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PLACEMENTS FOR CHILD FOR CHILDREN WHO NEED CHILDCARE. BY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AS WELL AS ONE POINT ONE BILLION TO IMPLEMENT CHILDCARE RATE REFORM WHICH MEANS TO PAY OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS BETTER THAN THOSE OF US WHO WATCH THIS PANDEMIC KNOW THAT MANY MORE WOMEN LEFT THE WORKPLACE AND WHY BECAUSE OF COURSE IN THE CLOSURES THEY HAD NO WORD THEY COULD BRING. THE PEOPLE THAT WERE DEPENDENT ON THEM THAT OTHERWISE WERE CARED FOR BY EITHER CHILD CARE PROVIDERS OR SOMEONE ELSE WHEN- EVERYTHING BEFORE PANDEMIC AND SO WHAT HAPPENS WOMEN END UP STAYING HOME AND OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT'S THE CASE EVEN WHEN IT'S- NOT CHILD CARE THAT IS THE PROBLEM BUT ANY OTHER CARE. THAT WE DEPEND ON SOMEONE ELSE TO PROVIDE FOR OUR FAMILY MEMBERS WHO NEED IT SO THIS TRANSFORMATIVE INVESTMENT OF CHILD CARE AND OTHERS THAT I WILL. DESCRIBED IN A MOMENT. WITH SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED WHEN THE LIVES OF ALL CALIFORNIANS BUT ESPECIALLY FAMILIES AND WOMEN. THEY'RE ALL THROUGH REALLY IMPRESSIVE FINANCIAL AID REFORMS INCLUDING THE BIGGEST CAL GRANTS EXPANSION SINCE ITS INCEPTION AND REBOOTING OF THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP TO COVER NON TUITION COSTS FOR STUDENTS. AND THESE TRANSFORMATIVE INVESTMENTS WILL HELP CALIFORNIANS PURSUE THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION DREAMS IN A WAY THAT RESULTS IN THEM OT HAVING TO BE CRIPPLED WITH STUDENT DEBT. WE'VE EXPANDED MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY TO ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS FIFTY PLUS YEARS OF AGE REGARDLESS OF THEIR STATUS BECAUSE THAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WE ARE RESTORING TWO THIRDS OF WHAT REMAINS OF THE CUTS THAT WE HAD TO MAKE IN THAT DEEP DARKEST RECESSION. S. S. I. N. S. S. P. AND THESE ARE MONTHLY PAYMENTS THAT ARE THE LIFELINE MANY CALIFORNIANS DEPEND ON. WE ARE ALSO PHASING IN THE INCREASES TO THE PROVIDERS WHAT THEY'RE PAID WHO PROVIDE THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND SO WHAT THAT'S CALLED IS THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES PROVIDER RATE STUDY. BUT THOSE FOLKS HAVE NOT HAD THEIR RATES FULLY RESTORED AGAIN SINCE THAT RECESSION AND SO WE ARE BEGINNING TO ADDRESS THAT NOT BEGINNING BUT WE HAVE PUT IT ON A PATH TO RESOLVE IT AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE PAID ADEQUATELY AND THE PEOPLE DEPENDED ON THEM. ARE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR NEEDS MET. WE ALSO REMOVED THE PART WE ARE. RESTORING PERMANENTLY THE CARD STORE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES HOURS. WE'VE MADE IMPROVEMENTS TO CAL WORKS PROGRAM TO BETTER SERVE OUR ECONOMICALLY STRUGGLING FAMILIES WE ARE PROVIDING STATE FUNDED NUTRITION BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIANS. WHO ARE IN ELIGIBLE FOR EITHER CALFRESH OR THE FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS SOLELY DUE TO THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. AND TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS THAT WE SEE EACH AND EVERYONE OF US EVERY DAY WITH SO MANY OF OUR NEIGHBORS ON HOUSE AND LIVING IN ENCAMPMENTS ON OUR STREETS OR PARKS OR ELSEWHERE AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT PROVIDES EIGHT POINT FIVE BILLION IN NEW FUNDING FOR HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS. OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS INCLUDING ONE BILLION IN ONGOING FLEXIBLE LOCAL FUNDING. IN RECOGNIZING THAT A FINE OR A FEE TO A PERSON OR A FAMILY WHOSE INCOME IS BARELY ALREADY MAKING ENDS MEET CAN BE GIVEN THE DEATH SPIRAL THAT ENDS PERHAPS IN THEIR LOSING YOUR CAR. WHICH IS THEN THEIR TRANSPORTATION TO WORK SO LOSING A JOB POTENTIALLY OR EVEN A HOME. EIGHTY ONE TWENTY EIGHT ELIMINATES VARIOUS CRIMINAL ADMINISTRATIVE FEES. PORTER SMALL BUSINESSES IN OUR NONPROFIT SO THAT HE CAN GET FULLY BACK ON THEIR FEET. THERE'S ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN ADDITIONAL SMALL BUSINESS AND NONPROFIT GRANTS. THEY'RE ALSO HISTORIC. INVESTMENTS IN RESOURCES IN INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGES IN SUCH THINGS AS DROUGHT WILDFIRE CLIMATE RESILIENCY AND MORE. AND THERE'S EIGHT POINT ONE BILLION AND ANOTHER ROUND OF GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PAYMENTS AND MUCH MUCH MORE. ALL OF THIS. IS WHY WE CONTINUE OUR RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING PRACTICES WITH TWENTY FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION IN OUR TOTAL RESERVES. PAYING OFF FULLY THE EDUCATION DEFERRALS AND MAKING ADVANCE PAYMENTS ON SOME BOND DEBTS. THE BUDGET WE ARE PASSING TODAY REPRESENTS A TWO PARTY DEAL BETWEEN THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY THIS IS THE LEGISLATURE'S BUDGET. WE ARE WORKING HARD TO OBTAIN A THREE PARTY DEAL THAT INCLUDES THE ADMINISTRATION. TODAY WE ARE PASSING A BUDGET THAT STANDS ON ITS OWN IN MEETING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE FOR PASSING A BALANCED BUDGET BY JUNE FIFTEENTH. I KNOW THIS WAS POINTED OUT ON THE FLOOR LAST YEAR. THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES TWO KEY DEADLINE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ANNUAL STATE BUDGET FIRST REQUIRES THE GOVERNOR TO PRESENT A BUDGET BY JANUARY TENTH EVERY YEAR SECOND IT REQUIRES THE LEGISLATURE TO PASS A BALANCED BUDGET. BY JUNE FIFTEENTH OF EVERY YEAR BUT NOTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THE GOVERNOR. TO ONLY PRESENT A BUDGET THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY AGREED TO AND SIMILARLY NOTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THE LEGISLATURE TO ONLY PASS THE BUDGET THAT THE GOVERNOR PRESENTED. SOME TODAY THE LEGISLATURE IS MEETING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION BY PASSING A RESPONSIBLE BUDGET THAT CONTINUES OUR DECADES LONG EFFORT TO BUILD FISCAL RESILIENCY WHILE UTILIZING A HISTORIC LEVEL OF RESOURCES FOR TRANSFORMATIVE INVESTMENTS. THAT WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS FOR CALIFORNIANS. AND OUR STATE AT THIS CRITICAL JUNCTURE AND WITH THIS I ASK FOR YOUR I. VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER MEMBERS WE ARE ON FILE ITEM FORTY NINE ASSEMBLY BILL. ONE TWENTY EIGHT. WHEN I MOVED TO A CENTER MELINDA'S WHY A FOR PURPOSE YOU RICE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- AND THEIR AMENDMENT AT THE DESK FORCE TO MOVE THE ONE TWENTY EIGHT WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT. THANK YOU MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ THE AMENDMENTS. AMENDMENTS BY SENATOR MELENDEZ SAID ONE. SIMILARLY AS YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATORS- FOR WEEKS YOU HAVE HEARD ME MAKE A MOTION AFTER MOTION ATTEMPTING TO BRING US HERE FIVE TO THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE WHICH WOULD END THE GOVERNOR'S DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY ON COATED. THE GOVERNOR'S UNCHECKED POWER SHOULD NOT CONTINUE ESPECIALLY WITH CALIFORNIA SUPPOSEDLY RE OPENING TOMORROW AND IT IS EXACTLY WHY I FIND IT TERRIBLY CONFUSING THAT THIS BODY WILL NOT APPROVE MY RESOLUTION BUT IS PERFECTLY WILLING TO INCLUDE IN THIS VERY BUDGET. A TEMPORARY PAUSE TO THE GOVERNOR TO THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY SPENDING POWERS. AND WIND. WHEN WOULD THE GOVERNOR RECLAIM THESE POWERS IN SEPTEMBER AT THE END OF SESSION. IT IS TIME TO END THE STATE OF EMERGENCY NOW IT MAKES NO SENSE TO TAKE THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY SPENDING POWERS AWAY TEMPORARILY ONLY TO RESTORE THEM DURING A TIME WHEN KEVIN EMERGENCY NO LONGER EXISTS WE ARE ABOUT TO AN ACTOR OUR SECOND STATE BUDGET. SINCE THE GOVERNOR TO PROCLAIM EMERGENCY DUE TO COPE IT. SO HOW CAN HE LOOK AT US WITH A STRAIGHT FACE AND SAY THAT HE STILL NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO EXECUTE EXERCISE EMERGENCY SPENDING POWER. THIS GOVERNOR HAS HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD CODE SPENDING INTO THE BUDGET. AMENDMENT AT THE DESK DO SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE WHICH IS AN EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITY EFFECTIVE JUNE FIFTEENTH. IF THE CRISIS IS INDEED OVER THEN THERE IS NO LONGER A NEED FOR THIS STATE OF EMERGENCY AND THE GOVERNOR'S UNILATERAL AUTHORITY. WE WRITE A LETTER ASKING THE GOVERNOR TO JUSTIFY THE NEED FOR AN EMERGENCY AND TO DISCUSS WHERE THE PERIL OF THIS EMERGENCY CURRENTLY EXISTS. EIGHT STATES HAVE COMPLETELY ENDED THEIR STATES OF EMERGENCY WITH TWENTY MORE CONSIDERING DOING SO BY THE END OF THE MONTH. WE'VE BEEN UNDER THIS EMERGENCY ORDER FOR FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY DAYS SENATOR. THE CAPITAL IS FINALLY OPENING ITS DOORS ONCE AGAIN TO BECOME THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. WE NEED TO TAKE BACK OUR CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY IF THE CRISIS IS OVER ENOUGH TO OPEN THE STATE TOMORROW. THEN THERE IS NO REASON TO ALLOW THE GOVERNOR TO HAVE UNIT WATER- CONTROLLING EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITY UNTIL JUNE OF NEXT YEAR ABSOLUTELY NOT AND SO SENATORS. I ASK FOR YOUR I. VOTE ON THESE AMENDMENTS AND OPPOSE ANY MOTION TO TABLE THEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR MELINDA'S SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PRESIDENT MOVED WITHIN MINUTES OF THE TABLE. THANK YOU SIR HERS BERG CENTER MELINDA'S HAS AMENDMENTS AT THE TABLES IN HERZBERG AS MOVE TO MOVE- LAY THOSE ON THE TABLE.

HIGHS THIRTY KNOWS NINE MOTION PASSES THE AMENDMENTS ARE LAID ON THE TABLE WILL MOVE BACK O THIS BILL IN CHIEF SENATOR SKINNER HAS PRESENTED ON EIGHTY ONE TWENTY EIGHT AND WILL MOVE TO MOTION ARE AT THIS DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT SENATOR NIELSEN YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN OR MEMBERS. I'M GOING TO URGE A NO VOTE ON THE BUDGET. I WILL STIPULATE THAT THERE'S MUCH IN THIS BUDGET. TO BE ATTRACTED TO. MUCH THAT IS POSITIVE. BUT THAT DOES NOT OUTWEIGH WHAT I THINK ARE THE NEGATIVE. ALL THE NEGATIVES THERE'S A STANDARD HERE NOW IT'S A PROCESS THAT DOESN'T EXIST A BUDGET PROCESS. I USED TO BE THAT THE BUDGET WAS SUBMITTED SUBCOMMITTEES WOULD MEET DELIBERATE. THEN THERE WOULD BE A VOTE IN EACH HOUSE- CONFERENCE COMMITTEE TO RECONCILE THE DIFFERENCES IN THE TWO HOUSE. THAT PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LEGISLATE TORS AND PROTECTING THE CITIZENS TO DIRECTLY IMPORT THE BUDGET. WELL FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE NOT HAD A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. IT IN THAT IN A VERY TOUGH BUDGET YEAR. WE DIDN'T HAVE A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND NOW IN A VERY POSITIVE. BUDGET YEAR WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE I ASSUME THAT THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEES IN THE SENATE. THE DAYS ARE DONE. THAT'S A SAD THING BUT IT'S THE REALITY. OF THE TIME. SO NOW WE DEAL WITH A PROCESS. THERE IS COMPROMISE. THIS MORNING IN BUDGET COMMITTEE THE PUBLIC DID GET THE COMMENT I THINK THERE WERE TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE. GOT TO CALL IN FOR ONE MINUTE. AND SAY I'M SO AND SO AND I LIKE TO BUT- I DON'T LIKE THE BUDGET. THAT'S THE EXTENT OF THE PUBLIC INPUT. NO SPECIFICS THAT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO CONVEY. NO OTHER VENUE THROUGH LEGISLATORS AS IN A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. SO THEY'RE FROZEN OUT. NOW I CAN'T BE THE RESIDENT HISTORIAN HERE BUT THIS IS THE FIRST BUDGET. THAT I REMEMBER VOTING FOR OR AGAINST. WHERE IN THE GOVERNOR HAD NOT MADE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE MAJORITY PARTY. THAT'S NOT THE CASE TODAY. YOU'RE BETTING THE FUTURE THAT THERE WILL BE A RESOLUTION WITH THE MAJORITY AND THE GOVERNOR ON MANY ISSUES. I TRUST THEY WILL BE BUT THEY'RE GONNA FOLLOW THEN IN THIS PLETHORA. NOW APPROACH TO NINETY FIVE BILLS NOT BOOKS THAT'S JUST OBSCENE. AND MANY OF THESE PROVISIONS AND BILLS. IN THE TRAILER BELOW DELUGE WILL BE MAJOR POLICY. DON'T GO THROUGH ANY POLICY COMMITTEE HEARING. I DON'T HAVE ANY PUBLIC INPUT IT'S JUST A JOB. THAT IS NO WAY TO CONDUCT THE LEGISLATIVE BUSINESS. MEETING STATUTORY BUSINESS OR LEGISLATIVE OR BUDGET BUSINESS BUT THAT'S THE WAY WE'RE DOING THESE DAYS. THE. IN A YEAR OF NOW SURPLUS LAST YEAR WE HAD A HECK OF A DEATH NO GO AHEAD THE SURPLUS WELL WE'RE STILL DRAWING FROM THE RESERVES EVEN IN THIS YEAR. A SURPLUS. DRAWING FROM THE USERS AND DOING SOME VIRUS NOW WE'RE DOING A LITTLE BIT OF DEBT RETIREMENT BUT NOT NEARLY ENOUGH. WITH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE. AND WHAT WOULD MOST ASSUREDLY DOING IS BUILDING THE BASE FOR THE FUTURE. AND CLOTHING AS RETIRED BY THE GOVERNOR CREATING A BUNCH OF NEW DEPARTMENTS. NOT DEPARTMENTS DO NOTHING IN GOVERNMENT EXCEPT GIRL. THEY DON'T GROW SMALLER THEY EXPAND THEIR AUTHORITIES. EVERY YEAR COME IN FOR MORE HE Y. H. GET BIGGER AND BIGGER. ALL THE ALL NECESSARY I DON'T THINK YOU COULD ARGUE ANY OF ALL OF THE ANY OF THESE WHO ARE WORTHY OF A DEPARTMENT STATUS OR THAT WE WOULD BE CRIPPLED WITHOUT HAVING DEPARTMENT STATUS. FOR THE- BUT THAT IS THE DEAL WERE DEALT WITH TODAY. AND WE ARE A BLIGHT GENE THE BLAST NEW INFLATION. CASH EXPANDING TO THE FIFTY OR OLDER REGARDLESS OF STATUS. IT'S GONNA END UP COSTING UP TO A BILLION DOLLARS. IN FUTURE BUDGETS. A BILLION DOLLARS. NOW IN THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IS NOT NEW BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN EXTENSIVELY REVIEWED. IN COMMITTEE. AND IT'S BEING FORCED UPON US. IN THE CLOSING MOMENTS OF THIS BUDGET. IT'S A PRUDENT BUDGET I WOULD ARGUE NOT. IT'S A HELPFUL BUDGET AND SOME THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO REDUCE ARE GETTING TO BE RESTORED. AND MANY OF US COULD SUPPORT THAT. IF NOT ALL OF US. BUT NOT THE WHOLE PACKAGE AND NOT THE WHOLE PROCESS. AND THUS I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON SENATOR BATES FOLLOWED BY SENATOR MELINDA IS. THEIR FATE THANK YOU HOME MR PRESIDENT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSCORE ALL COMMENTS OF MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM TO HIM- REGARDING- THE REVENUES THE WINDFALL REVENUES. AND MY CONCERN ABOUT THE BUDGET THAT'S BEFORE US DESPITE THE RECORD SITTING WINDFALL REVENUES BOTH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND THIS ONE BEFORE US TODAY STILL BORROW MONEY AND WITHDRAWAL RESERVES TO DRIVE SPENDING EVEN HIGHER. BOTH PROPOSALS FAILED THE FAILED TO RESTORE FUNDING THAT WAS TAKEN FROM THE RAINY DAY FUND LAST YEAR WHEN WE AT THAT TIME WE DID THINK WE HAVE A DEFICIT IN TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THESE CURRENT PROPOSALS INCLUDE WITHDRAWING EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE RAINY DAY FUND IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND IN ADDITION BORROWING FROM SPECIAL FUNDS THE NONPARTISAN LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ADVISED AGAINST THESE IRRESPONSIBLE TACTICS IT SHOULD BE COMMON SENSE TO REVERSE BUDGET SAVINGS ACTIONS NOW. THAT THE BUDGET HAS DRAMATICALLY TURNED AROUND DOES ANYONE REALLY THINK THAT THE VOTERS WHO OVERWHELMINGLY REMEMBER THEY OVERWHELMINGLY VOTED TO CREATE THE RAINY DAY FUND. I THOUGHT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR WOULD NOT FULLY FUND THE RAINY DAY FUND IN A YEAR WHEN WE ARE SEEING RECORD REVENUES EVEN WORSE THIS ANYONE THINK THAT THE VOTERS THOUGHT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR WOULD BE BORROWING. FROM THE RAINY DAY FUND IN A YEAR WITH RECORD REVENUES I THINK NOT FOR THESE REASONS I CANNOT SUPPORT THESE ACTIONS TODAY SO I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES SENATOR MELINDA'S. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT SENATORS THIS IS NOT A BUDGET THIS IS A BLUEPRINT TO MEET TOMORROW'S JUNE FIFTEENTH DEADLINE UNDER PROP TWENTY FIVE THE BUDGET PROCESS HAS NOW BECOME A SESSION LONG AFFAIR WITH VERY LITTLE TRANSPARENCY PROVIDED TO THE PUBLIC. FOR EXAMPLE THIS BUDGET PROVIDES MORE FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS BUT FAILS TO ADDRESS PARENTS CONCERNS BY NOT REQUIRING CHILDREN TO BE BACK IN SCHOOL FULL TIME AND NOT. BE AS SOON AS- THEY CONTINUE USED USE THE BORROWING STRATEGY FROM ONE YEAR WHEN KOBE WAS RAMPANT IN THE STATE DID NOT HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF ITS FINANCES. AND I WILL ADMIT THAT THERE ARE SOME GOOD THINGS IN THIS BUDGET. FUNDING THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN RATE STUDY FOR THE DDS COMMUNITY HELPING SMALL BUSINESSES WITH GRANTS TO RE OPEN. EXPANDING MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT BEDS AND FULLY FUNDING THE BARSTOW VETERANS HOME. BUT THIS IS NOT D. BUDGET. WHY ARE WE CONTINUING TO BORROW MONEY FROM THE RAINY DAY FUND WITH ALL OF THE SURPLUS AND FINDING THAT WE HAVE THAT DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME WE HAVE A DROUGHT DECLARATION WE'RE NOT SPENDING A SINGLE PENNY. NOT A SINGLE PENNY ON NEW WATER STORAGE PROJECTS WITH THE SPENDING PLAN. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE VOTERS WERE SOLD ON A GAS TAX INCREASE TO PROVIDE FIVE BILLION IN SPENDING FOR ROADS THAT REVENUE IS NOW FIFTY BILLION. IS THERE A NEED TO CONTINUE THE TAX ON CALIFORNIANS WHEN GAS IS NOW OVER FOUR DOLLARS A GALLON NEARLY EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE. IS THERE A NEED TO AUTOMATICALLY INCREASE THE GAS TAX NEXT MONTH. ADDITIONALLY WHAT CAN BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN FIXING THE BROKEN SYSTEMS AT EDT WHICH YOU ARE ALL WELL AWARE OF. HOW CAN THIS BUDGET FAILED TO FIX THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FRAUD THAT HAD BEEN ALLOWED. TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF INMATES AND FRAUDSTERS INSTEAD OF UNEMPLOYED CALIFORNIANS WHO ACTUALLY NEED THE ASSISTANCE. AND FINALLY. I FIND IT TO BE NONSENSE TO PAUSE THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITY WHEN WE CAN TAKE IT AWAY PERMANENTLY RIGHT NOW WITHIN I VOTE ON S. C. R. FIVE THE REJECTION OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT I OFFERED MAKE NO SENSE WHEN YOU CONSIDER THEIR INCLUSION AND THIS WITH THE PAUSE BUTTON IN THIS BUDGET. IF YOU WERE WILLING TO TAKE YOUR POWER BACK BUT ONLY UNTIL THE END OF SESSION. WHAT SENSE DOES THAT MAKE. IF THE MAJORITY PARTY IS WILLING TO ABDICATE ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO THE GOVERNOR. THEN WHY HAVE A LEGISLATURE AT ALL. IS OUR ONLY FUNCTION NOW RELEGATED TO PASSING BILLS THAT ONLY ADD NEW TEXT TO THE SHELVES AND SHELVES OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS CURRENTLY IN PLACE IS THAT NOW OUR ONLY FUNCTION. I REJECT THE PREMISE THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS CENTERS TO SACRAMENTO TO MERELY PASSED BILLS INSTEAD OF FIGHTING FOR THE ISSUES AND SPENDING PRIORITIES THAT AFFECT THEM EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND THERE'S A REASON ARTICLE ONE OF OUR CONSTITUTIO OUTLINE THE POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LEGISLATURE FIRST. IT WAS TO ENSURE THE PEOPLE'S VOICE IS ALWAYS HEARD BEFORE AN EXECUTIVE. EXERTED THEIR WILL IT IS TIME TO PUT THE PEOPLE FIRST AND PASS A RESPONSIBLE AND COMPLETE BUDGET. NOT JUST THE OUTLINE OF ONE I WOULD ASK RESPECTFULLY FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SENATOR MELINDA AS ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON ASSEMBLY BILL ONE TWENTY EIGHT. SENATOR TROUBLED. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THE NEXT BUDGET FOR THIS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS BUDGET HAS GOOD INVESTMENTS IN EDUCATION CHILDCARE AND HIGHER EDUCATION. THIS BUDGET ALLOWS ALLOCATE NEW FUNDING FOR HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS INCLUDING A BILLION DOLLARS IN N GOING FLEXIBLE LOCAL FUNDING. IT RESTORES SSI BUDGET CUTS FROM PREVIOUS YEARS TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THE ELDERLY. IT PROVIDES A ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR WATERVIEW REGIS INCREASED FUNDING FOR PARK GRANTS AND A HUNDRED MILLION FOR SPECIAL DISTRICTS. I'M THANKFUL FOR ALL OF THE DISCUSSIONS I'VE HAD WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE TO HIGHLIGHT THESE ISSUES. THANK YOU ALSO FOR THE INVESTMENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND FOR FULFILLING SEVERAL OF MY BUDGET REQUEST. DESPITE ALL THESE GOOD THINGS I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE BEING SENT OUT IN THE STATE WITHOUT ANY ACCOUNTABILITY DETAILS ARE REPORTING ASSOCIATED WITH IT. THERE ARE SEVENTEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN FINES IN THIS BUDGET WHICH LIT WHICH LITTLETON NO DETAIL IS AVAILABLE. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE GIVEN US IS USED EFFICIENTLY. FOR THESE REASONS I'LL BE UPSTANDING TODAY BUT LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING REVISIONS OF THIS BUDGET IN FUTURE TRAILER BILLS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR TROUBLE GET ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON ASSEMBLY BILL ONE TWENTY EIGHT ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING NONE SINNERS CAN I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. THANKS SO MUCH- I APPRECIATE THAT OUR COLLEAGUES FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE- DID PRAISE MANY ASPECTS OF THIS BUDGET. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A GREAT BUDGET BUT ALLOW ME TO CORRECT A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT WERE REFERENCED. FIRST OFF. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT WE HAVE APPROVED A BUDGET BEFORE WE HAVE COME TO THE FULL AGREEMENT- WE PASSED TO A BUDGET LAST YEAR- INSTANCE PROP TWENTY FIVE WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD A NUMBER OF TIMES WHERE. THERE WERE STILL A FEW THINGS TO WORK OUT AND- BEFORE WE ARE AT THE WYNDHAM MEN MINTS THAT WE HAD TO DO- BEFORE WE HAD ASSIGNED BUDGET SO THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL. AND THE OTHER POINT THAT I WANTED TO CORRECT IS THIS ISSUE OF THAT WE THAT THIS BUDGET THAT WHAT THEY ARE SPENDING PLAN. IS BASED ON BORROWING FROM THE RESERVES NOT AT ALL. THERE WAS THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE RESERVES IN THE BUDGET WE THE EXPECTATION OF DROP IN REVENUE. WHICH OF COURSE WOULD FORTUNATELY DID NOT EXPERIENCE AND SO THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. NOT ONLY RESTORES THAT BUT IT INCREASES THE DEPOSITS IN OUR- BSA ARE MEETING OUR BUDGET SURPLUS ACCOUNT OUR SAFETY NET RESERVE IN OUR PROP NINETY EIGHT SCHOOLS RESERVE. AND THE RAINY DAY FUND RIGHT NOW HAS ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION MORE THAN IS CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED SO WE ACTUALLY WITH THE ADOPTION OF THIS BUDGET WILL HAVE THE HIGHEST RESERVES YET EVER IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. SO I JUST WANTED TO CORRECT THAT ONE I'M IN ADDITIONALLY. THERE WERE SOME REFERENCE IN THE- COMMITTEE THAT PERHAPS THIS WAS NOT BALANCE TO THAT WE WOULD BE FACING A DEFICIT IMMEDIATELY NEXT YEAR. IN FACT THE- PROJECTION BASED ON EXPENDITURES HERE ARE FOR A BALANCED BUDGET FOR THE NEXT FOUR FISCAL YEARS. SO I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE VERY PROUD ABOUT I THINK THIS IS A BUDGET THAT REALLY HELPS CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE BEEN SO AS WE KNOW ALL OF US IMPACTED BY THIS PANDEMIC WHETHER IT'S OUR BUSINESSES OUR FAMILIES. THERE ARE NONPROFITS ARE CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS ARE SCHOOLS YOU NAME IT WE HAVE. IN THIS BUDGET. OUR SCHOOLS WILL HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE OBVIOUSLY ARE GOOD NOT ONLY. BRINGING CHILDCARE BACK FULLY BUT GREATLY EXPANDING IT SO THAT THE WOMEN IN THE WORK FORCE CAN RETURN TO THE WORK FORCE WHICH WE KNOW OUR BUSINESSES NOW. OUR BUSINESSES ARE SAYING THAT YOU KNOW THEY'VE DAY CONNIE WANTS TO ROAR BACK AND YET. SOME PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GO BACK TO WORK YET HI THEY CAN'T LEAVE HOME YET BECAUSE OF COURSE. THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE THAT NEED TO BE CAREFUL KERO. SO THIS BUDGET DOES ALL OF THAT AND SO MUCH MORE AND WE SHOULD FEEL SO PROUD OF IT AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS.

ARE WELL WERE TEMPORARILY BACK IN SESSION- BUSINESSES SUPPOSEDLY WILL BE RE OPENING THINGS WILL SUPPOSEDLY BE GOING BACK TO NORMAL THEREFORE. I DON'T SEE ANY REASON TO CONTINUE THE STATE OF EMERGENCY I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS HINTED. THAT HE NEEDS THE STATE OF EMERGENCY TO CONTINUE SO THAT HE HAS THE FLEXIBILITY TO MOVE QUICKLY IN THE EVENT THAT PERHAPS THERE'S A SURGE OR SOMETHING ELSE TAKES PLACE. AND I WOULD. RESPOND TO THAT BY REMINDING YOU HOW QUICKLY WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE WHEN THE PANDEMIC FIRST HIT IN MARCH AND HOW QUICKLY WE WERE ABLE TO PUT THINGS INTO PLACE TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE PUBLIC WAS PROTECTED SO THERE IS NO REASON TO KEEP THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IN PLACE BECAUSE WE CAN MOVE JUST AS QUICKLY.
