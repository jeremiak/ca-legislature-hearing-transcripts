MORE OPEN ON MIGHT SHAKE ROOF.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.808
AND I SAID YOU OKAY NOW WE GOTTA

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:51.577
GET WATER GET OUT YOU KNOW WHAT.

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:52.645
SO.

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:53.846
I WORKED ON LEGISLATION HOW DO

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:55.114
WE PREVENT ELECTRICAL FIGHTERS

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:58.184
HOW DO WE HOW DO WE PREVENT WENT

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.585
OUT WHEN A TELEPHONE POLE WITH

00:06:59.652 --> 00:07:01.053
ELECTRIC APPLIANCES.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.555
HIT AND IT SNAPS HOW DO WE

00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:04.590
PREVENT THE SPARKS.

00:07:04.657 --> 00:07:05.892
AND I WANT TO THANK MY

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:06.993
COLLEAGUES BECAUSE EVERYONE

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:09.962
VOTED FOR THAT BILL. FOURTEEN

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:11.197
SIXTY THREE THREE YEARS AGO BUT

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:14.033
BUT THE GOVERNOR VETOED IT.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.903
AND NOW WE'VE HAD MAJOR FIRES

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:19.906
CAUSED BY ELECTRIC LINES AND

00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:21.274
THAT'S BEEN EMOTIONALLY

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.875
DISTURBING TO ME BECAUSE WE

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:25.711
TRIED. TO DO SOMETHING TO START

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:27.280
HARDENING THESE ASSETS.

00:07:27.346 --> 00:07:29.115
SO YOU DO A LOT OF RESEARCH AND

00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:31.117
YOU SAY WELL WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO.

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:32.285
OBVIOUSLY A FEW.

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:34.086
DECADES AGO WE DECIDED IT WOULD

00:07:34.153 --> 00:07:35.288
BE A GOOD IDEA NOT TO YOU SHAKE

00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:36.956
ROOFS.

00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:39.458
YOU KNOW THAT'S ALL STOPPED --

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:42.795
BUT WHAT'S NEXT AND SO I HAD-SOMEONE IN MY OFFICE.

00:07:42.862 --> 00:07:43.362
WITH AN IDEA AND HE SAID YOU

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:44.197
KNOW IF YOU COULD PUT A WATER

00:07:44.263 --> 00:07:46.332
TANK UNDER THE PROPERTY WHEN YOU

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:48.768
BUILD YOUR MOUNTAIN CABIN OR

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:49.869
WHATEVER IT IS.

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:51.571
I MEAN YOU HAVE SPRINKLERS ON

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:52.171
ALL FOUR CORNERS AND MAY BE IF

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:54.240
IT'S A RECTANGULAR YOU HAVE TO

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:56.442
MORE IN THE MIDDLE.

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:57.777
AND THEN YOU CAN USE YOUR IPHONE

00:07:57.844 --> 00:07:59.712
AND IF OF FIRES COMING.

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:01.013
THE AT THE SPRINKLERS COME UP

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.316
AND THEY SHOOT OUT.

00:08:03.382 --> 00:08:04.584
AND YOU COULD EVEN HAVE THE

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.485
CHEMICAL POWDER THAT YOU COULD

00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:07.286
COMBINE WHICH WOULD BE A FIRE

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:08.554
RETARDANT.

00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:10.857
SO PEOPLE ARE THINKING OF IDEAS

00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:13.593
OTHER THAN NO SHAKE AND MOVE THE

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:15.027
VEGETATION AWAY FROM THE HOMES.

00:08:15.094 --> 00:08:16.195
SO I'M I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:18.497
SOME INNOVATIVE IDEAS OR

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:20.233
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO.

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:24.103
BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS A MOTION

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.104
WAS TOUGH AND NOW WE'VE LOST

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:25.338

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:55.734
THOSE TREES.

00:13:55.801 --> 00:13:57.469
WERE ATTACKED BECAUSE OF FIRE

00:13:57.536 --> 00:13:59.705
WENT SO FAST.

00:13:59.772 --> 00:14:00.272

CANOPY.

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:03.709
SO THE HOPE FOR AREAS LIKE

00:14:03.776 --> 00:14:05.277
PARADISE IS THAT BEAUTIFUL

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:07.580

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:11.403
EFFECTS OF DEVASTATING WILDFIRES

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.405
IN OUR STATE.

00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:14.039
OF THE UP WHAT I THOUGHT I WOULD

NO THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE

00:16:30.556 --> 00:16:32.391
OVERGROWN FORCED AND PROLONGED

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:33.792
DROUGHT HAVE RESULTED IN

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:36.161
UNPRECEDENTED TREE MORTALITY IN

00:16:36.228 --> 00:16:37.896
THE STATE'S FORCED AS WELL AS AN

00:16:37.963 --> 00:16:39.131
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER.

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:42.334
SIZE AND SEVERITY OF WILDFIRES.

00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:44.336
LOSS OF LIFE AND STRUCTURES AS A

00:16:44.403 --> 00:16:45.804
DIRECTOR PROXIMATE RESULT OF

00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:47.473
WILDFIRES.

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:50.109
IS AN ALL TIME HIGH HI.

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:52.077
IN TURN CAL FIRE HAS SET ITS

00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:53.746
FOCUS ON INCREASING THE PACE AND

00:16:53.812 --> 00:16:55.180
SCALE THE FIRE PREVENTION

00:16:55.247 --> 00:16:56.215
ACTIVITIES.

00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:57.750
AS A KEY ELEMENT IN OUR BATTLE

00:16:57.816 --> 00:16:59.017
AGAINST THE DESTRUCTIVE AND

00:16:59.084 --> 00:17:00.853
DEADLY WILDFIRES.

00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:02.688
WE USE THE STATE'S STRTEGIC

00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:04.623
FIRE PLAN AS A ROAD MAP.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.058
THIS PLAN WAS RECENTLY UPDATED

00:17:06.125 --> 00:17:07.826
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND

00:17:07.893 --> 00:17:09.061
SPECIFICALLYCALLS OUT THE

00:17:09.128 --> 00:17:10.562
IMPORTANCE OF FIRE PREVENTION

00:17:10.629 --> 00:17:12.498
AND LAND USE PLANNING.

00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:14.533
OUR WORK IS TO REDUCE THE IMPACT

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.335
IN THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES.

00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:16.869
HAS BEEN LONG PART OF OUR

00:17:16.935 --> 00:17:18.837
MISSION BUT OVER THE PAST YEARS

00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:20.239
WE HAVE DOUBLED DOWN ON THOSE

00:17:20.305 --> 00:17:21.507
EFFORTS.

00:17:21.573 --> 00:17:23.542
IN FACT SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:24.476
TEN WE HAVE NEARLY DOUBLED THE

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:26.545
NUMBER OF ACRES THAT HAVE BEEN

00:17:26.612 --> 00:17:28.380
TREATED BY FUEL REDUCTION.

00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:29.448
WE HAVE TRIPLED THE NUMBER OF

00:17:29.515 --> 00:17:32.084
ACRES TREATED BY PRESCRIBED FIRE.

00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:33.819
AND WE'VE INSPECTED OVER ONE

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:35.921
POINT TWO MILLION HOMES FOR

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:37.556
DEFENSIBLE SPACE CLARENCE.

00:17:37.623 --> 00:17:39.491
FACILITATED OVER ONE HUNDRED

00:17:39.558 --> 00:17:41.093
MILLION GRANT ONE HUNDRED

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.661
MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS FOR

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:45.063
LOCAL FIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.498
AND WE HAVE ASSISTED IN THE

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:48.967
REVIEW AND SUBMITTAL OF THIRTY

00:17:49.034 --> 00:17:50.569
FOUR LOCAL SAFETY ELEMENTS TO

00:17:50.636 --> 00:17:51.970
THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE

00:17:52.037 --> 00:17:53.839
PROTECTION.

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.874
CALIFORNIA'S DRY MEDITERRANEAN

00:17:55.941 --> 00:17:57.476
CLIMATE HAS LENT ITSELF TO

00:17:57.543 --> 00:18:00.446
WILDFIRES. FOR CENTURIES.

00:18:00.512 --> 00:18:01.580
AND WHILE WE MUST TAKE EVERY

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:03.582
STEP TO PREVENT AND SUPPRESS

00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:05.417
HUMAN BECAUSE WILDFIRES WE MUST

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:08.720
ALSO ADAPT TO WILDFIRES.

00:18:08.787 --> 00:18:10.823
ADAPTING TO WILDFIRES IS A

00:18:10.889 --> 00:18:12.124
SYSTEMATIC APPROACH.

00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:13.859
AND AS COMMITTEE MEMBERS KNOW

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:15.394
THERE IS NO ONE SILVER BULLET

00:18:15.461 --> 00:18:16.995
THAT WILL FIX THIS PROBLEM.

00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:18.363
IT'S GONNA REQUIRE HOLISTIC

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:19.364
EFFORTS.

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:20.532
AND IT MEANS PLANNING

00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:22.234
COMMUNITIES ARE HARDENED AGAINST

00:18:22.301 --> 00:18:23.535
WILDFIRES.

00:18:23.602 --> 00:18:24.937
WITH FEW BREAKS IN AND AROUND

00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:26.405
THE COMMUNITIES.

00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:27.973
IT MEANS PROPERTY EVACUATION

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.676
ROUTES WATER SUPPLIES AND FIRE

00:18:30.742 --> 00:18:32.644
PROTECTION RESOURCES.

00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:33.946
IT INCLUDES BUILDING HOMES OUT

00:18:34.012 --> 00:18:35.547
OF MEMBER RESISTANT MATERIALS

00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:37.549
WHILE MAINTAINING A ONE HUNDRED

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:38.884
FOOT DEFENSIBLE SPACE CLEARANCE

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:40.719
BY REMOVING DEAD.

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:43.555
AND OVERGROWN VEGETATION.

00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:45.023
CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE MOST

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.159
STRINGENT WELL IN BUILDING AND

00:18:47.226 --> 00:18:49.261
FIRE CODES IN THE WORLD.

00:18:49.328 --> 00:18:50.762
AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NEW

CONSTRUCTION IN CALIFORNIA'S

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:54.099
WILDLANDS WE REQUIRES BUILDING

00:18:54.166 --> 00:18:55.467
MATERIALS.

00:18:55.534 --> 00:18:57.870
THAT ARE IGNITION RESISTANT.

00:18:57.936 --> 00:18:59.605
THE WELL IN URBAN INTERFACE OR

00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:01.173
WE WE BUILDING CODES ARE

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.242
REVIEWED EVALUATED AND AND

00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:04.910
AMENDMENTS ARE RECOMMENDED AT

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:06.879
REGULAR INTERVALS.

AND EVEN BUILDING TECHNIQUES.

00:19:23.695 --> 00:19:24.930
DURING A RECENT CO DEVELOPMENT

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:27.466
CYCLE WE WE HAD FIVE PROPOSALS

00:19:27.533 --> 00:19:29.134
THAT WERE APPROVED.

00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:30.168
FROM THE WE WE COMMITTEE IN

00:19:30.235 --> 00:19:32.204
THOSE INCLUDED UL LISTED GARAGE

00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:34.039
DOOR --

00:19:34.106 --> 00:19:35.440
WEATHER STRIPPING TO PREVENT

00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:38.210
KIMBER IGNITION IN THE GARAGE.

OVER SKYLIGHTS.

00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:42.781
THESE WERE RECENTLY ADOPTED BY

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:43.615
THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING

00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:45.284
STANDARDS COMMISSION IN IN IS

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.353
ADDED TO OUR CURRENT CHAPTER

SEVEN A BUILDING CODES.

00:19:50.055 --> 00:19:51.323
OF COURSE THE ONE MILLION DOLLAR

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.525
QUESTION IS WHAT ABOUT THE HOMES

00:19:53.592 --> 00:19:56.595
BUILT BEFORE TWO THOUSAND AND

00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:57.796

COST BUILDING RETROFIT LIST.

00:20:00.632 --> 00:20:01.633
WE THINK THIS WILL BE AN

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.001
EXTREMELY HELPFUL GUIDE TO

00:20:03.068 --> 00:20:04.336
HOMEOWNERS ON EASY HOME

00:20:04.403 --> 00:20:05.637
IMPROVEMENTS THAT WILL HARDEN

THEIR HOME AGAINST WELFARE

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:08.307
EMBERS.

00:20:08.373 --> 00:20:10.042
WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO EDUCATE

00:20:10.108 --> 00:20:11.610
AND INCENTIVIZE HOMEOWNERS TO

00:20:11.677 --> 00:20:13.712
UPGRADE THEIR HOMES THAT WERE

00:20:13.779 --> 00:20:14.212
BUILT BEFORE THE CURRENT

00:20:14.279 --> 00:20:15.314
BUILDING CODES.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.882
THE SERVER MUST BE COMMUNITY

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:18.450
BASED TO AVOID INCONSISTENT

00:20:18.517 --> 00:20:21.253
APPLICATION.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.287
BECAUSE ONE HOME THAT IS

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:23.855
COMPLIANT WITH RETROFIT

00:20:23.922 --> 00:20:25.691
CONSTRUCTION AND THE NEXT DOOR

00:20:25.757 --> 00:20:27.359
NEIGHBOR IS NOT.

00:20:27.426 --> 00:20:28.727
IN CLOSE PROXIMITY.

00:20:28.794 --> 00:20:30.028
WELL THEM BOTH HOMES ARE STILL

00:20:30.095 --> 00:20:32.431
AT RISK SO REALLY NEEDS TO BE A

00:20:32.497 --> 00:20:34.232
COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT.

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:35.734
HOME HER NAME IS A CRITICAL STEP

00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:36.969
IN MAKING COMMUNITY FIRE

00:20:37.035 --> 00:20:38.270
RESISTANT.

00:20:38.337 --> 00:20:38.670
IN FACT --

00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:41.306
DAMAGE INSPECTION ANALYSIS OF

00:20:41.373 --> 00:20:44.309
SHOWN THAT 93% OF ALL STRUCTURES

00:20:44.376 --> 00:20:45.577
TO CATCH FIRE DURING A WILDFIRE

00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:48.046
WILL BE DESTROYED.

00:20:48.113 --> 00:20:49.314
TIED CLOSELY TO THE WELL IN

00:20:49.381 --> 00:20:50.983
BUILDING CODES IS A FIRE HAZARD

00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:52.851
SEVERITIES OWNS.

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:55.187
THESE AREAS OR ZONES ARE BASED

00:20:55.253 --> 00:20:57.055
ON THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS SUCH

00:20:57.122 --> 00:20:59.658
AS FUEL SLOPE --

00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:01.793
FIRE HISTORY AND EVEN WHETHER.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.261
OUR FIRE RESOURCE ASSESSMENT

00:21:03.328 --> 00:21:05.397

FIELD TESTING MODEL THAT IS USED

00:21:11.336 --> 00:21:13.338
TO IDENTIFY THREE INCREASING

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:16.908
FIRE HAZARD AREAS OR ZONES.

00:21:16.975 --> 00:21:19.011
MEDIUM HIGH AND VERY HIGH.

00:21:19.077 --> 00:21:20.579
CALIFORNIA HAS BEGUN THE PROCESS

00:21:20.646 --> 00:21:22.514
OF UPDATING THE THE FIRE HAZARD

00:21:22.581 --> 00:21:25.117
SEVERITIES OWNS USING THE LATEST

TECHNOLOGIES AND MAPPING.

00:21:27.152 --> 00:21:28.420
NEW MAPPING WILL INCLUDE NEW

00:21:28.487 --> 00:21:30.589
FACTORS INCLUDE INCLUDING LAND

00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:32.758
LEASE LAND USE CHANGES NEW

00:21:32.824 --> 00:21:34.359
SIGNIFICANT WHEN DATA.

00:21:34.426 --> 00:21:35.994
AS WELL AS A MODEL THAT IS MORE

00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:38.330
SPATIALLY DETAILED.

00:21:38.397 --> 00:21:39.865
MAPS ARE IMPORTANT.

00:21:39.931 --> 00:21:40.799
AND ESPECIALLY IN THE LOCAL

00:21:40.866 --> 00:21:42.734
RESPONSIBILITY AREAS WHERE THE

00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:44.469
VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITIES

00:21:44.536 --> 00:21:46.805
OWN TRIGGERS THE WELL IN

00:21:46.872 --> 00:21:47.272
BUILDING CODES FOR NEW

00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:48.473

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:49.775
OF COURSE THESE CODES APPLY TO

00:21:49.841 --> 00:21:51.476
ALL THREE ZONES IN THE STATE

00:21:51.543 --> 00:21:53.679
RESPONSIBILITY AREA.

00:21:53.745 --> 00:21:55.647
IT'S BEEN ASKED OF THESE MAPS

00:21:55.714 --> 00:21:56.148
SHOULD BE UPDATED MORE

00:21:56.214 --> 00:21:57.949
FREQUENTLY AND THE REALITY IS

00:21:58.016 --> 00:21:59.551
MOST OF THE FACTORS ARE CONSTANT

00:21:59.618 --> 00:22:01.386
OVER THE YEARS.

00:22:01.453 --> 00:22:02.521
WE UPDATE THE MODEL IS NEW

00:22:02.587 --> 00:22:03.955
TECHNOLOGY OR SCIENCE BECOMES

00:22:04.022 --> 00:22:06.324
AVAILABLE. FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE

00:22:06.391 --> 00:22:08.694
JUST COMPLETING NEW DATA ON

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.529

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.465
THESE ISOLATED AND EXTREME WHEN

00:22:13.532 --> 00:22:15.067
THE BANDS HAVE BEEN AT THE ROOT

00:22:15.133 --> 00:22:16.101
OF THE SEVERITY CAUSED BY THE

00:22:21.973 --> 00:22:23.208
SO THIS NEW DATA ON MICRO

00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:26.111
CLIMATES IS AN IMPORTANT CHANGE

00:22:26.178 --> 00:22:27.579
REQUIRING REMAPPING.

OUR WE WE COMMITTEES.

00:24:22.727 --> 00:24:25.130
ANOTHER KEY ROLE THAT --

00:24:25.197 --> 00:24:26.598
ANOTHER KEY PLAYER I SHOULD SAY

00:24:26.665 --> 00:24:28.366
IN THIS EFFORT.

00:24:28.433 --> 00:24:30.502
IS THE ROLE OF THE HOMEOWNER.

00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:32.170
IT IS KEY TO THE FIRE PREVENTION

00:24:32.237 --> 00:24:34.339
AS 95% OF ALL WHILE AND FIRES

00:24:34.406 --> 00:24:36.007
ARE CAUSED BY THE ACTIVITY THE

00:24:36.074 --> 00:24:37.909
PEOPLE.

00:24:37.976 --> 00:24:39.077
THIS MEANS WE ABSOLUTELY NEED

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:40.946
RESIDENTS AND VISITORS TO BE

00:24:41.012 --> 00:24:42.514
EXTRA CAUTIOUS OUTDOORS TO

00:24:42.581 --> 00:24:45.383
PREVENT SPARKING A NEW WILDFIRE.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:46.818
WE KNOW DEFENSIBLE SPACE IS THE

00:24:46.885 --> 00:24:48.153
LAW.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.454
IN OUR EFFORTS HAVE MADE GAINS

00:24:49.521 --> 00:24:50.922
IN COMPLIANCE BUT WE NEED TO

00:24:50.989 --> 00:24:52.724
EDUCATE HOMEOWNERS ON THE

00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:54.559
BENEFITS OF HOME HARDENING.

00:24:54.626 --> 00:24:55.994
IS PROVEN TO DRAMATICALLY

00:24:56.061 --> 00:24:57.195
INCREASE THE CHANCE OF SURVIVING

00:24:57.262 --> 00:24:59.297
A WILDFIRE.

00:24:59.364 --> 00:25:00.732
CALIFORNIA IS READY FOR WILDFIRE

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:01.566
APP.

00:25:01.633 --> 00:25:03.735
IT WILL HELP HOMEOWNERS PREPARE

00:25:03.802 --> 00:25:05.370
FOR A WHILE FIRE IT'S AVAILABLE

00:25:05.437 --> 00:25:06.338
TO TO DOWNLOAD.

00:25:06.404 --> 00:25:07.973

STANDARDS SIDE --

00:26:00.592 --> 00:26:02.093
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.628
STANDARDS THAT APPLY TO NEW

00:26:03.695 --> 00:26:04.863
CONSTRUCTION CORRECT CORRECT.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.264
AND SO.

00:26:06.331 --> 00:26:07.632
WHEN IT COMES TO REBUILDING MY

00:26:07.699 --> 00:26:09.334
UNDERSTANDING IS IT ALSO DOESN'T

00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:13.138
APPLY NECESSARILY TO DIDN'T TO

00:26:13.204 --> 00:26:14.940
REBUILDS OF HOMES THAT CORRECT?

AS WELL AS RETROFIT OBVIOUSLY

00:26:17.309 --> 00:26:18.476
THAT'S GOING TO BE AT THE

00:26:18.543 --> 00:26:19.811
DISCRETION OF THE HOME OR

00:26:21.613 --> 00:26:24.516
AND SO --

00:26:24.582 --> 00:26:26.985
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO ACTUALLY?

00:26:27.052 --> 00:26:30.889
THE PUSH FOR THE STANDARDS ON

00:26:30.956 --> 00:26:32.090
THE REBUILD EFFORTS SO WE DON'T.

00:26:32.157 --> 00:26:33.792
REPEAT THE MISTAKES THE PAST

00:26:33.858 --> 00:26:35.026
WE'RE GOING THROUGH A REBUILDING

00:26:35.093 --> 00:26:36.795
EFFORTS I KNOW THAT SOME OF OUR

00:26:36.861 --> 00:26:37.762
CITIES --

00:26:37.829 --> 00:26:38.797
THAT ARE DEALING WITH THE WILL

00:26:38.863 --> 00:26:40.298
THE FIRE RIGHT NOW WRESTLING

00:26:40.365 --> 00:26:41.933
WITH THIS VERY QUESTION --

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.702
NOT JUST AROUND YOU KNOW DRIVE

00:26:43.768 --> 00:26:45.537
WAYS AND THINGS LIKE THAT UNDER

00:26:45.603 --> 00:26:47.005
FIRE CODE BUT SPECIFICALLY THE

00:26:47.072 --> 00:26:48.406
BUILDINGS THEMSELVES IS THAT AT

00:26:48.473 --> 00:26:49.741
THE DISCRETION OF LOCAL

00:26:49.808 --> 00:26:51.176
GOVERNMENT TO ADOPT THOSE

00:26:51.242 --> 00:26:52.844
STANDARDS OR HOW DOES THAT WORK.

00:26:52.911 --> 00:26:54.045
WELL WE'RE WORKING THAT OUT

00:26:54.112 --> 00:26:55.780
THROUGH OUR WE WE COMMITTEE --

00:26:55.847 --> 00:26:57.582
WE WE HAVE --

00:26:57.649 --> 00:26:59.651
AT OUR LAST MEETING WE WORK IF I

00:26:59.718 --> 00:27:02.387
MAY USE THE TERM --

00:27:02.454 --> 00:27:02.721
SPIT BALLING.

00:27:02.787 --> 00:27:06.391
I THAT COULD BE RELATIVELY LOW

00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:08.326
COST FOR HOMEOWNERS TO IMPLEMENT

00:27:08.393 --> 00:27:10.295
ONE OF THOSE IS IS SCREENING THE

00:27:10.362 --> 00:27:11.963
BENSON NEEDS --

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.264
THAT'S A FAIRLY LOW COST AS A

00:27:13.331 --> 00:27:14.833
MENTION THE GASKET IN IN IN

00:27:14.899 --> 00:27:16.167
GARAGES --

00:27:16.234 --> 00:27:17.469
THAT'S AN AREA THAT HAS BEEN

00:27:17.535 --> 00:27:19.371
IDENTIFIED WHERE AMBER IGNITIONS

00:27:19.437 --> 00:27:21.172
OCCUR -- SO

00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:22.040
THERE ARE THERE ARE THINGS YOU

00:27:22.107 --> 00:27:23.675
CAN DO --

00:27:23.742 --> 00:27:25.076
OBVIOUSLY CHAPTER SEVEN A HAS.

00:27:25.143 --> 00:27:27.212
LISTED STANDARDS FOR FOR GLAZING

00:27:27.278 --> 00:27:30.215
FOR WINDOWS FOR EXTERIOR CITING

00:27:30.281 --> 00:27:31.616
FOR DECKING --

00:27:31.683 --> 00:27:34.319
SO THAT'S A THAT'S AVAILABLE AS

00:27:34.386 --> 00:27:35.387
WELL -- I A

00:27:35.453 --> 00:27:37.389
I THINK THROUGH THE BUT NEW

00:27:37.455 --> 00:27:40.425
CONSTRUCTION IS THE I'M TOUCH ME

00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:41.092
BACK UP.

00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:42.994
CHAPTER SEVEN A IS APPLICABLE TO

00:27:43.061 --> 00:27:44.596
NEW CONSTRUCTION A LOCAL

00:27:44.662 --> 00:27:46.331
ORDINANCE GOOD COULD TRIGGER IT

00:27:46.398 --> 00:27:47.932
THROUGH A REMODEL OF A CERTAIN

00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:49.534
PERCENTAGE FOR EXAMPLE LIKE WE

00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:51.636
DO FOR ROOFING IN SOME AREAS 50%

00:27:51.703 --> 00:27:52.570
OR MORE.

00:27:52.637 --> 00:27:54.472
YOU HAVE TO COMPLY --

00:27:54.539 --> 00:27:56.007
OR OR YOU CAN BE EVEN MORE

00:27:56.074 --> 00:27:56.741
RESTRICTIVE.

00:27:56.808 --> 00:28:00.111
BUT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WORKING ON

00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:01.413
THAT ISSUE [inaudible]

00:28:01.479 --> 00:28:05.350
HOW CAN HOMEOWNERS TO RETROFIT

00:28:05.417 --> 00:28:08.086
THEIR HOMES AND IT'S NOT JUST A

00:28:08.153 --> 00:28:09.721
MATTER OF HOW BUT IT'S ALSO HOW

00:28:09.788 --> 00:28:10.855
TO HOW TO FIND IT?

00:28:10.922 --> 00:28:11.456
YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S A BIG

00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:12.924
ISSUE TO IT.

00:28:12.991 --> 00:28:14.359
UNDER CURRENT LAW IT WOULD TAKE

00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:15.894
A LOCAL ORDINANCE EITHER THROUGH

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:20.899
COUNTY OR CITY TO APPLY CHAPTER

00:28:20.965 --> 00:28:22.500
SEVEN A TO REBUILDING.

00:28:22.567 --> 00:28:24.069
IS THAT CORRECT OR SEVEN DAYS

00:28:24.135 --> 00:28:25.537
ADOPTED BY THE STATE FIRE

00:28:25.603 --> 00:28:27.505
MARSHAL SO IT'S AUTOMATICALLY --

00:28:27.572 --> 00:28:29.674
ENFORCE IT AUTOMATICALLY IT IS

00:28:29.741 --> 00:28:30.942
ENFORCEABLE FOR NEW BUILDINGS

00:28:31.009 --> 00:28:32.143
BUT WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE LEGAL

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.312
PACKED IMPLEMENTATION FOR NOT

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:37.982
FOR RETROFIT BUT FOR FOR REBUILD.

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:39.517
OR IS THERE.

00:28:39.584 --> 00:28:41.419
ONE THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION OKAY.

00:28:41.486 --> 00:28:42.087
TIME ELEVEN TO GET BACK WITH YOU

00:28:42.153 --> 00:28:43.354
IN OKAY GOOD AND WE CAN WE CAN

00:28:43.421 --> 00:28:44.923
TEASE THAT OUT MAYBE IN

00:28:44.989 --> 00:28:45.557
SUBSEQUENT PANELS MY ONE OF THE

00:28:45.623 --> 00:28:46.224
QUESTION.

00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:47.692
WAS ABOUT.

00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:53.364
YOUR YOUR AT SEVERITY MAPPING --

00:28:53.431 --> 00:28:54.566
HI IS THIS SIZE IT GOES RIGHT DO

00:28:54.632 --> 00:28:56.167
WE NEED TO GO HIGHER BUT WHAT IS

00:28:56.234 --> 00:28:58.303
EXTREME I THINK THIS LOOK LIKE

00:28:58.369 --> 00:28:59.504
THAT INCLUDES EXTREME.

00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:00.572
AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE WITH THE

00:29:00.638 --> 00:29:01.673
WIND DATA THAT WE'RE GONNA BE

00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:03.675
COLLECTING WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE

00:29:03.741 --> 00:29:05.677
TO DO MICRO CLIMATES A TWO

00:29:05.743 --> 00:29:06.578
HUNDRED ACRES.

00:29:06.644 --> 00:29:08.313
OR OR TWENTY OR TWO ACRES OR

00:29:08.379 --> 00:29:09.781
LESS -- SO

00:29:09.848 --> 00:29:11.049
IT'S GONNA BE IT'S GONNA BE THAT

00:29:11.116 --> 00:29:13.151
SPATIAL ELEMENT ALONG WITH THE

00:29:13.218 --> 00:29:14.352
WINDS -- IN

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:15.920
A TWO KILOMETERS TWO KILOMETER

00:29:15.987 --> 00:29:17.889
GRID IS REALLY GOING TO GIVE A

00:29:17.956 --> 00:29:20.658
LOT MORE INFORMATION INTO THOSE

00:29:20.725 --> 00:29:21.459
MAPS.

00:29:21.526 --> 00:29:22.127
SO THE QUESTION YOU HAVE SIR IS

00:29:22.193 --> 00:29:23.595
IS WHETHER OR NOT WE NEED TO GO

00:29:23.661 --> 00:29:24.996
AN EXTREME LEVEL --

00:29:25.063 --> 00:29:26.698
I THINK WITH A VERY HIGH FIRE

00:29:26.764 --> 00:29:28.633
HAZARD SEVERITIES OWNSIN THAT

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.635
BEING TIED TO THE BUILDING CODES --

00:29:30.702 --> 00:29:33.404
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD START SO

00:29:33.471 --> 00:29:34.873
WE I FORGET THE NUMBER PROJECTS

00:29:34.939 --> 00:29:37.775
THAT WERE IN YOUR EXPEDITED HAVE

00:29:37.842 --> 00:29:40.311
VEGETARIAN FUEL MANAGEMENT

00:29:40.378 --> 00:29:43.681
STRATEGY. FORTY THIRTY FIVE THAT

00:29:43.748 --> 00:29:45.350
ARE THIRTY FIVE OKAY SO.

00:29:45.416 --> 00:29:46.584
YET THIRTY FIVE PARTY PROJECTS

00:29:46.651 --> 00:29:48.186
THERE BUT THE MAP OBVIOUSLY IS

00:29:48.253 --> 00:29:49.954
MUCH BIGGER SO HOW MUCH WITHIN

00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:52.891
THE VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY

00:29:52.957 --> 00:29:54.392
ZONES DIDN'T WE COVER.

00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:56.127
WITH THOSE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS

00:29:56.194 --> 00:29:57.562
THOSE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS WERE

00:29:57.629 --> 00:29:59.597
IDENTIFIED BY OUR CAL FIRE UNITS

00:29:59.664 --> 00:30:01.566
AS BEING CRITICAL TO PROTECTING

00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:03.268
THE COMMUNITIES IN THEIR UNITS.

00:30:03.334 --> 00:30:05.570
AND SO THOSE ARE ONES THAT THAT

00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:06.437
PRIMARILY HAVE ALREADY BEEN

00:30:06.504 --> 00:30:08.706
PLANNED AND AND FOR THE MOST

00:30:08.773 --> 00:30:10.441
PART PERMITTED AND ARE READY TO

00:30:10.508 --> 00:30:11.609
GO WE'RE READY SHOVEL READY ON

00:30:11.676 --> 00:30:11.843
THOSE.

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:14.212
OKAY SO WE FELT THAT WAS THE

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:14.879
BEST USE.

00:30:14.946 --> 00:30:17.182
AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND SO

00:30:17.248 --> 00:30:18.683
WE'RE WE'RE GETTING READY TO TO

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.351
MOBILIZE ON I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

00:30:20.418 --> 00:30:21.486
PLACES I'VE SOME FOLLOW UP

00:30:21.553 --> 00:30:23.421
QUESTIONS BUT I'LL DEFER TO MY

00:30:23.488 --> 00:30:25.023
FELLOW CHAIR.

00:30:25.089 --> 00:30:26.457
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR FUTURE

00:30:26.524 --> 00:30:27.425
FARMERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:28.526
TAKING THE TIME TO COULD YOU SEE

SIR GOOD TO SEE YOU --

00:30:31.796 --> 00:30:33.097
I THINK THAT AGAIN THERE'S BEEN

00:30:33.164 --> 00:30:34.732
SO MUCH FOCUS OF THE BILLION

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:36.134
DOLLARS THAT MOVE LAST YEAR IN

00:30:36.201 --> 00:30:38.336
REGARDS TO VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

00:30:38.403 --> 00:30:39.704
ENDANGERING BEFORE.

00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:41.306
MAKING KALIFORNIA AROUND

00:30:41.372 --> 00:30:43.208
FIREFIGHTING FORCE OR FORTY

00:30:43.274 --> 00:30:45.443
MILLION RIGHT THING TO DO.

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:47.045
RECALLING THEIR TAX BASE RIGHT

00:30:47.111 --> 00:30:47.979
THING TO DO.

00:30:48.046 --> 00:30:49.614
BLACK HAWK HELICOPTERS ALL THE

00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:50.815
APPARATUS THINK WE NEED TO BE

00:30:50.882 --> 00:30:51.749
ABLE TO GET.

00:30:51.816 --> 00:30:53.284
BACK TO NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE

00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:54.185
STANDARD --

00:30:54.252 --> 00:30:55.186
WHEN IT COMES TO ENGINES BUT

00:30:55.253 --> 00:30:57.889
THAT'S JUST ANOTHER PLUS --

00:30:57.956 --> 00:31:00.925
BUT THE WE'RE STILL TALKING IN

00:31:00.992 --> 00:31:02.193
COMMITTEE ON THE ISSUES OF HOME

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.095
HEARTENING.

00:31:04.162 --> 00:31:06.664
AND I THINK I THINK WE'RE HERE.

00:31:06.731 --> 00:31:07.465
AND I'M NOT GONNA BUT WORDS IN

00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:08.533
YOUR MOUTH AND DISCUSS ANYTHING

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.501
PROBABLY FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:31:10.568 --> 00:31:12.070
WERE NOW THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL --

00:31:12.136 --> 00:31:14.472
STEP IN THIS PROCESS CAN BY THE

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:15.940
HOMEOWNER.

00:31:16.007 --> 00:31:17.041
AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IN

00:31:17.108 --> 00:31:19.978
REGARDS TO HOME HARDENING.

00:31:20.044 --> 00:31:23.848
AT NEW DEVELOPMENT AND WHAT NEW

00:31:23.915 --> 00:31:26.751
STANDARDS ARE WE GONNA REQUIRE --

00:31:26.818 --> 00:31:28.553
WHEN YOU SEE LANDUSE CHANGES IN

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.054
THE MAPPING --

00:31:30.121 --> 00:31:31.556
THE EIGHT WITHIN MAPPING THAT

00:31:31.623 --> 00:31:32.457
YOU'RE TAKING A LOOK AT RIGHT

00:31:32.523 --> 00:31:35.026
NOW THAT'S WITHIN THE COMMITTEE

00:31:35.093 --> 00:31:35.960
WHAT IS THAT ME.

00:31:36.027 --> 00:31:37.161
ARE THERE COULD BE A CHANGE FROM

00:31:37.228 --> 00:31:39.497
AGRICULTURAL --

00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:42.033
TO TO RESIDENTIAL COULD BE YOU

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:42.800
KNOW ANY OF THOSE OWNING CHANGES

00:31:42.867 --> 00:31:44.736
COULD BE FROM.

00:31:44.802 --> 00:31:45.570
FROM.

00:31:45.637 --> 00:31:47.305
FROM THEIR FROM WHILE IN TWO TO

00:31:47.372 --> 00:31:48.473
DEVELOPMENT IN AWHILE AND IS

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:50.908
RESIDENTIAL COULD BE INDUSTRIAL

00:31:50.975 --> 00:31:52.110
COMMERCIAL --

00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:53.344
SO THOSE TYPE OF CHANGES --

00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:55.647
THAT WEREN'T INCLUDED BEFORETHE

00:31:55.713 --> 00:31:57.282
BECAUSE MAYBE THE MAPPING --

00:31:57.348 --> 00:31:59.250
THAT WAS USING THE TWENTY

00:31:59.317 --> 00:32:02.387
FIFTEEN VEGETATION --

00:32:02.453 --> 00:32:03.521
MAPPING.

00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:05.056
DIDN'T SHOW THOSE DEVELOPMENTS

00:32:05.123 --> 00:32:06.691
IN THOSE AREAS AND SO THOSE ARE

00:32:06.758 --> 00:32:07.425
DIFFERENT CHANGES SO YOU'RE

00:32:07.492 --> 00:32:09.027
GONNA HAVE AN ENCROACHMENT OUT

00:32:09.093 --> 00:32:10.295
OF THE WELL AND INTO AN URBAN

00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:11.996
ENVIRONMENT AND SO THAT WILL

00:32:12.063 --> 00:32:12.864
BECOME A VERY HIGH.

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.400
THE MOST LIKELY.

00:32:15.466 --> 00:32:17.168
WHAT TYPE OF RECOMMENDATIONS CAN

00:32:17.235 --> 00:32:21.306
WE EXPECT FOR PRE EXISTING HOMES

00:32:21.372 --> 00:32:21.906
AND STRUCTURES WITHIN THE WHAT

00:32:21.973 --> 00:32:23.675
WE?

00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:26.010
IT'S A TOUGH ONE SENATOR --

00:32:26.077 --> 00:32:26.944
BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY

00:32:27.011 --> 00:32:29.647
DIFFERENT THEORIES VARIATIONS OF

00:32:29.714 --> 00:32:31.149
WHAT IS A RESIDENTS.

00:32:31.215 --> 00:32:33.718
IN IN THE WE WE BUT FOR A SINGLE

00:32:33.785 --> 00:32:34.285
FAMILY HOME --

00:32:34.352 --> 00:32:36.354
YOU KNOW THE I THINK WE NEED TO

00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:38.790
INCENTIVIZE --

00:32:38.856 --> 00:32:40.058
LET ME BE SPECIFIC ABOUT THAT

00:32:40.124 --> 00:32:42.994
AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT A LOT

00:32:43.061 --> 00:32:45.296
A LOT OF HOMES AND RESIDENCES

00:32:45.363 --> 00:32:47.365
THAT THAT TO OUR OUR MOBILE HOME

00:32:47.432 --> 00:32:48.299
PARKS.

00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:49.634
AND SO RETROFITTING THEM IS IT

00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:52.904
IS IT.

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:55.406
THE CHALLENGE IN A SINGLE FAMILY

00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:57.875
HOME -- AND

00:32:57.942 --> 00:32:59.444
AND AND DEVELOPMENT.

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.712
SO.

00:33:00.778 --> 00:33:01.846
YOU KNOW WE WE ARE DISCUSSING

00:33:01.913 --> 00:33:03.414
THIS IN IN OUR WE WE COMMITTEE

00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:05.149
WE NEED TO FIND A WAY PERHAPS TO

00:33:05.216 --> 00:33:06.651
INCENTIVIZE.

00:33:06.718 --> 00:33:08.953
THE THE RETROFITS WE'VE DONE

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.488
THAT AT POST DISASTERS WITH

00:33:10.555 --> 00:33:11.422
EARTHQUAKES.

00:33:11.489 --> 00:33:13.091
WITH THAT DONE THAT IN SOME

00:33:13.157 --> 00:33:14.926
AREAS ONE IS WITH OTHER FLOOD TO

00:33:14.992 --> 00:33:17.595
HAVE WITH OTHER OTHER DISASTERS

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:19.364
AND ANOTHER RISK --

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:20.298
AND HEN THERE SB FUNDING

00:33:20.365 --> 00:33:22.967
AVAILABLE I THINK SOMEHOW TO TO

00:33:23.034 --> 00:33:24.535
HELP OFFSET THE COST.

00:33:24.602 --> 00:33:25.803
THERE WAS A GREAT STUDY THAT'S

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.171
COMING OUT IN AND SOME OF THE

00:33:27.238 --> 00:33:28.873
PANEL MEMBERS BEHIND ME MAY BE

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:30.208
SPEAKING ABOUT THIS THE COST OF

00:33:30.274 --> 00:33:31.309
RETROFITTING.

00:33:31.376 --> 00:33:33.478
OF FROM HAD ONE HEADWATERS

00:33:33.544 --> 00:33:34.979
ECONOMICS --

00:33:35.046 --> 00:33:36.547
YOU KNOW THE THAT IT SHOWS THAT

00:33:36.614 --> 00:33:38.082
THE NEW CONSTRUCTION IT'S FAIRLY

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:42.053
COMPARABLE IF NOT EVEN CHEAPER.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:42.687
TO TO TO BUILD THIS BUT IN THE

00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:44.222
RETRO AREA BECAUSE YOU HAVE

00:33:44.288 --> 00:33:46.624
DEMOLITION COST AND YOU HAVE THE

00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:48.526
BUILDING BECAUSE IT DRIVES IT UP

00:33:48.593 --> 00:33:49.994
SLIGHTLY --

00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:51.429
BUT SO IF WE COULD FIND A WAY TO

00:33:51.496 --> 00:33:53.164
IN AND INCENTIVIZE PERHAPS

00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:55.032
THROUGH INSURANCE OR OR SOME

00:33:55.099 --> 00:33:56.234
OTHER FUN AND WORKING THROUGH

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.902
THE THE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS WE

00:33:57.969 --> 00:33:59.337
HAVE A LOT OF MONEY IN GRANTS IF

00:33:59.404 --> 00:34:00.772
THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN.

00:34:00.838 --> 00:34:01.973
PROVIDE THAT MONEY THROUGH

00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:04.142
THROUGH NONPROFITS TO WORK WITH

00:34:04.208 --> 00:34:05.510
THE LOCALS AND WHO CAN IN TURN

00:34:05.576 --> 00:34:07.044
COULD HELP PRIVATE PRIVATE

00:34:07.111 --> 00:34:11.382
HOMEOWNERS AND LANDOWNERS.

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:13.551
YEAH LOOK I THINK WE WHATEVER IS

00:34:13.618 --> 00:34:15.386
GOING TO BE ESTABLISH IT NEEDS

00:34:15.453 --> 00:34:16.487
TO HAVE THE SAME BIGGER --

00:34:16.554 --> 00:34:19.757
THAT WE'VE HAD ON PUTTING MORE

00:34:19.824 --> 00:34:22.360
APPARATUS ON THE ROAD --

00:34:22.427 --> 00:34:24.128
NEEDS AT THE SAME BIGGER OF

00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:25.396
REMOVING DEAD AND DYING TREES

00:34:25.463 --> 00:34:27.165
ARE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT --

00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:31.335
BECAUSE GOING THROUGH THE THE

00:34:31.402 --> 00:34:33.404
NORTH A FIRE STORM --

00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:34.639
WITH THE CENTER TO MY RIGHT

00:34:34.705 --> 00:34:35.873
GOING THROUGH --

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:37.742
THE TERRIBLE FIRES DOWN SOUTH

00:34:37.809 --> 00:34:39.777
AND AT THE SENATOR WITH THE

00:34:39.844 --> 00:34:41.045
CAMPFIRE --

00:34:41.112 --> 00:34:43.114
TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE IN THERE

00:34:43.181 --> 00:34:44.582
HAS TO BE SOME TYPE FUND THAT WE

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:46.250
SEEN IN FLORIDA --

00:34:46.317 --> 00:34:47.318
THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO HARDEN YOUR

00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:49.120
HOME WHEN IT COMES PRE EXISTING

00:34:49.187 --> 00:34:52.156
STRUCTURES WHEN IT COMES --

00:34:52.223 --> 00:34:55.693
TO HURRICANES I SENT I KNOW THAT

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.861
BUT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO USE

00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:58.529
PACE LOANS --

00:34:58.596 --> 00:34:59.997
THROUGH SPECIAL DISTRICTS I GET

00:35:00.064 --> 00:35:00.698
IT -- TO BE

00:35:00.765 --> 00:35:02.767
ABLE DO HOME HARDENING WHEN IT

00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:04.669
COMES TO HURRICANES AND THAT

00:35:04.735 --> 00:35:06.437
ALSO HELPS WITH THE INSURANCE

00:35:06.504 --> 00:35:07.538
RATING AS WELL.

00:35:07.605 --> 00:35:09.073
AND THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR THE

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.942
TEAM ADMINISTRATOR TODAY --

00:35:11.008 --> 00:35:11.943
IS.

00:35:12.009 --> 00:35:14.979
WHAT TYPE OF POTENTIAL STATE?

00:35:15.046 --> 00:35:16.781
FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP CAN THERE BE

00:35:16.848 --> 00:35:18.282
WHEN IT COMES TO FINDING JUST

00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:20.751
LIKE WE SEEN WITH --

00:35:20.818 --> 00:35:22.887
RAISING HOMES WITH SLIDES YES

00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:24.655
AND OTHERWISE SAY YOU WILL NO

00:35:24.722 --> 00:35:26.691
LONGER BE INSURED BUT YOU HAVE

00:35:26.757 --> 00:35:28.726
TO BE IN IT BY THE WAY THIS

00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:29.961
IMPACTS FOLKS.

00:35:30.027 --> 00:35:31.395
BUT I WORK FOR EVERY DAY RIGHT

00:35:31.462 --> 00:35:33.130
ON THE NORTH COAST BUT WE'RE AT

00:35:33.197 --> 00:35:35.299
THE POINT NOW WHERE WE HAVE TO

00:35:35.366 --> 00:35:38.402
PUT PUBLIC MONEY BEHIND IT IN

00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:39.103
INCENTIVIZE.

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:40.037
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOOK AT

00:35:40.104 --> 00:35:41.372
FOR EXAMPLE.

00:35:41.439 --> 00:35:42.907
IF I'M GONNA REMODEL HALF OF MY

00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:45.343
HOME THAT DAY IN TRIGGERS HOME

00:35:45.409 --> 00:35:46.611
HARDENING THERE HAS TO BE SOME

00:35:46.677 --> 00:35:48.913
TYPE OF TRIGGER TO BE A TO DO

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:49.547
THAT WHAT WHAT IS YOUR REACTION

00:35:49.614 --> 00:35:51.048
TO THAT --

00:35:51.115 --> 00:35:52.083
THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH A

00:35:52.149 --> 00:35:53.484
LOT OF OTHER PROVISIONS IN THE

00:35:53.551 --> 00:35:56.420
CODE AS IT RELATES TO REMODELING --

00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:57.655
YOU HAVE TO BRING IT UP TO CODE

00:35:57.722 --> 00:35:59.123
FOR OF SPECIFIC STANDARDS I

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.158
COULD BE ENERGY COULD BE --

00:36:01.225 --> 00:36:04.595
YOU KNOW BUILDING A FIRE EASY

00:36:04.662 --> 00:36:06.197
FOR EXAMPLE --

00:36:06.264 --> 00:36:07.698
I AGREE WITH YOU WE NEED A SENSE

00:36:07.765 --> 00:36:08.900
OF URGENCY.

00:36:08.966 --> 00:36:10.134
I I THINK --

00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:11.903
YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING IN THE FAR

00:36:11.969 --> 00:36:13.037
MORE CELS UPS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:14.839
YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO

00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:16.407
BRAINSTORM THESE IDEAS.

00:36:16.474 --> 00:36:18.009
AND WE WE HAVE SOME SOME PRETTY

00:36:18.075 --> 00:36:21.012
SOME PRETTY --

00:36:21.078 --> 00:36:22.613
IN WHO WORK WITH THESE PRODUCTS

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:23.748
EVERY DAY AND THEY'RE WORKING

00:36:23.814 --> 00:36:25.349
THEY UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY OF

00:36:25.416 --> 00:36:26.918
THE ISSUE AND AND THEY CAN SEE

00:36:26.984 --> 00:36:28.553
THE DEVASTATION WE'RE TALKING

00:36:28.619 --> 00:36:28.753
ABOUT.

00:36:28.819 --> 00:36:30.221
THE THE BUILDERS --

00:36:30.288 --> 00:36:31.956
THE FORCE MANUFACTURERS THE

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:33.257
BUILDING MATERIALS --

00:36:33.324 --> 00:36:36.294
INDUSTRY IS IS PARTICIPATING IN

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.495
THIS COMMITTEE.

00:36:37.562 --> 00:36:39.530
AND SO THEY HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO

00:36:39.597 --> 00:36:41.098
FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS AS WELL

00:36:41.165 --> 00:36:42.900
ARE WE TALKING GUIDELINES OUR

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:46.571
MANDATES.

00:36:46.637 --> 00:36:50.741
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION --

00:36:50.808 --> 00:36:53.811
MANDATE SEEM TO WORK BETTER.

00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:55.546
BUT NO CAN BE VERY CONTROVERSIAL

00:36:55.613 --> 00:36:57.014
BUT LET IT BUT IT COMES AT A

00:36:57.081 --> 00:37:00.084
COST IN AND THEN.

00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:01.485
YOU KNOW HOW MANDATE TO FUND IT.

00:37:01.552 --> 00:37:03.287
YEAH AND THAT'S WHY --

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:04.989
WHAT I WOULD HOPE IS IF?

00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:07.858
WE ARE GOING DOWN THAT ROAD THAT

00:37:07.925 --> 00:37:10.695
THERE IS JUST AS MUCH FOCUS.

00:37:10.761 --> 00:37:12.730
ON PROVIDING FINANCIAL

00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:14.231
ASSISTANCE FOR HOMEOWNERS.

00:37:14.298 --> 00:37:15.967
AS THERE HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON

00:37:16.033 --> 00:37:17.501
REMOVING DEAD AND DYING TREES

00:37:17.568 --> 00:37:19.270
BECAUSE IT ALL GOES TOGETHER.

00:37:19.337 --> 00:37:21.072
AND ULTIMATELY IT'S GOING TO

00:37:21.138 --> 00:37:22.940
KEEP RESIDENTS SAFE FOR AND IT'S

00:37:23.007 --> 00:37:23.774
GOING TO KEEP.

00:37:23.841 --> 00:37:25.710
OUR PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL

00:37:25.776 --> 00:37:29.146
SAFER AT TIMES I HAVE --

00:37:29.213 --> 00:37:31.282
OF EVACUATION.

00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.949
WHEN IT COMES --

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:35.086
TO EVACUATION ROUTES MANY THESE

00:37:35.152 --> 00:37:36.220
SUBDIVISIONS I KNOW AND I I

00:37:36.287 --> 00:37:37.221
DON'T SPEAK FOR THE REST OF

00:37:37.288 --> 00:37:38.789
STATE BUT I'M SURE AND CENTER

00:37:38.856 --> 00:37:39.190
NIELSEN'S.

00:37:39.256 --> 00:37:41.792
NECK OF THE WOODS AS WELL ONE

00:37:41.859 --> 00:37:42.893
WAY IN ONE WAY OUT.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.396
SO AT A MINIMUM A NEEDING TO BE

00:37:45.463 --> 00:37:46.464
ABLE TO MANDATE IF YOU'RE GONNA

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:47.598
BE DOING SOME TYPE OF RULE

00:37:47.665 --> 00:37:49.333
SUBDIVISION.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:49.967
YEAH YOU HAVE TO TRY TO FIGURE

00:37:50.034 --> 00:37:50.701
OUT.

00:37:50.768 --> 00:37:52.069
HOW TO GET TO GET FOLKS IN A NOW

00:37:52.136 --> 00:37:54.839
AND NOT JUST ON ONE ROAD --

00:37:54.905 --> 00:37:56.273
BUT IT WOULD BE A LOOP HAVE YOU

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.142
BEEN DISCUSSING THAT YES THAT'S

00:37:58.209 --> 00:37:59.610
OUR LAND USE PLANNING IN FACT WE

00:37:59.677 --> 00:38:00.211
HAVE -- IT'S

00:38:00.277 --> 00:38:02.513
A BUDGETED ITEM FOR THIS YEAR

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.547
FOR THE PERSONNEL TO GO OUT AND

00:38:03.614 --> 00:38:05.349
DO A SURVEY OF THOSE EXISTING

00:38:05.416 --> 00:38:06.250
COMMUNITIES.

00:38:06.317 --> 00:38:07.551
AND THEN OUR LAND USE PLANNING

00:38:07.618 --> 00:38:09.587
FOLKS WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE

00:38:09.654 --> 00:38:11.389
LOCALS AS THEY'RE NOT ONLY

00:38:11.455 --> 00:38:12.423
OPENING THEIR SAFETY ELEMENTS

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:13.524
BUT AS ARE CONSIDERING

00:38:13.591 --> 00:38:15.059
DEVELOPMENT INTO THE INTO THE WE

00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:17.128
WE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:38:17.194 --> 00:38:18.362
WE HAVE ACCESS.

00:38:18.429 --> 00:38:20.631
AS IS A RESPONDING AGENCY OR THE

00:38:20.698 --> 00:38:22.066
FIRE DISTRICTS ARE COUNTIES IN

00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:23.134
THAT THEY HAVE SUFFICIENT WATER

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.101
SUPPLY IN THAT THY'RE

00:38:24.168 --> 00:38:25.336
SUFFICIENT FIRE PROTECTION

00:38:25.403 --> 00:38:26.237
RESOURCES.

00:38:26.303 --> 00:38:27.838
BUT WE YOU KNOW WE ALSO THE

00:38:27.905 --> 00:38:29.040
PROBLEM WITH THAT --

00:38:29.106 --> 00:38:30.307
THE CAMPFIRE.

00:38:30.374 --> 00:38:34.979
AND SO WE WANT --

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:36.147
TO WE WE IN FACT ARE CAL FIRE

00:38:36.213 --> 00:38:37.715
UNITS ALREADY HAVE A LIST OF

00:38:37.782 --> 00:38:39.183
THOSE THOSE CRITICAL

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:40.885
SUBDIVISIONS AND SO WILL BE

00:38:40.951 --> 00:38:42.687
FOLLOWING UP WITH THAT AND

00:38:42.753 --> 00:38:44.488
WORKING WITH THE LOCALS AS WELL.

00:38:44.555 --> 00:38:47.191
MY LAST QUESTION IS GOING TO BE

00:38:47.258 --> 00:38:49.660
ON PREVIOUS DECISIONS ON LOCAL

00:38:49.727 --> 00:38:50.795
PLANNING UNDERSTAND THAT WERE

00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:52.530
LIVING WITH THEM.

00:38:52.596 --> 00:38:53.564
WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES

00:38:53.631 --> 00:38:55.266
TOP THREE ISSUES?

00:38:55.332 --> 00:38:57.301
THAT CAL FIREOR MUNICIPAL FIRE

00:38:57.368 --> 00:38:59.904
AGENCIES FACE WHEN IT COMES A

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:00.504
PRIOR DECISIONS AND BUILDING

00:39:00.571 --> 00:39:01.806
WHEN THE WILL BE WHEN IT COMES A

00:39:01.872 --> 00:39:03.874
RESPONSE.

00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:06.043
WHEN IT COMES TO RESPONSE YEAH --

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:06.977
CENTER WILL DO RESPECT I'M GONNA

00:39:07.044 --> 00:39:07.912
HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT

AND THE CPC HAVE BEEN WORKING ON

00:40:33.197 --> 00:40:35.132
THESE MAPS FOR EIGHT YEARS AND

OWN UTILITY SYSTEM IT'S ONLY

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.248
BECAUSE OF THE AND AND THEY KNEW

00:40:51.315 --> 00:40:52.950
IT WAS EXPENSIVE TO UNDERGROUND

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:09.733
CETERA [inaudible]

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.802
ANSEL.

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:13.103
WE'RE FINDING FROM UTILITIES ARE

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:14.338
SAYING WHAT WE GET HARDEN OUR

00:41:14.405 --> 00:41:15.506
ASSETS BUT THAT'S ONLY GONNA

00:41:15.573 --> 00:41:18.209
TAKES CARE 60% OF THE ISSUE.

00:41:18.275 --> 00:41:21.045
I'M BEING TOLD BY THE CPUC YEAH

00:41:21.111 --> 00:41:22.880

EXPENSIVE BUT WE NEED THESE.

00:41:24.248 --> 00:41:26.517
POLLS FOR FIVE G. IN THE FUTURE

00:41:26.584 --> 00:41:28.786
AND ALL THE REST AND THEREFORE

00:41:28.853 --> 00:41:30.621
YOU GOTTA KEEP THESE BACK I HAVE

AND THEY'RE CARRYING HIGH

00:41:38.562 --> 00:41:40.130
VOLTAGE ELECTRICITY.

00:41:40.197 --> 00:41:42.233
SO THAT'S THAT'S THE BIG FEAR

00:41:42.299 --> 00:41:43.434
FOR THE HOMEOWNER IS NOT

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.069

HAPPENS TO SOMEONE THAT IS.

00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:50.608
FALLING ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL IN

IT'S ALL.

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:55.446
MIKE MY QUESTION IS.

00:41:55.512 --> 00:41:57.548
I'M EVE SAID TODAY THAT THE MAPS

ARE DONE.

00:41:58.716 --> 00:42:00.818
AND THAT NOW THEY CAN BE REVISED

00:42:00.885 --> 00:42:03.454
BUT I JUST WANNA KNOW WHY IT'S

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.890
TAKING SO LONG AND WHAT CAN I DO

00:42:05.956 --> 00:42:09.493
AS A SENATOR. TO GET THE UTILITY

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.561
COMPANIES.

00:42:10.628 --> 00:42:12.162
THE GILMORE PROACTIVE I MEAN

00:42:12.229 --> 00:42:13.631
THEY'RE ALL COMING IN NOW

00:42:13.697 --> 00:42:13.964
BECAUSE I'M --

00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:16.066
VICE CHAIR OF ENERGY.

00:42:16.133 --> 00:42:17.635

00:42:19.203 --> 00:42:19.803
SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:21.472
DOING.

00:42:21.538 --> 00:42:23.440
BUT OBVIOUSLY P. JEANNIE FAILED.

00:42:23.507 --> 00:42:25.209
MISERABLY ANOTHER IN CHAPTER

00:42:25.276 --> 00:42:27.144
ELEVEN BANKRUPTCY SO WHAT CAN WE

00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:30.214
DO THAT ENCOURAGES UTILITIES TO

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:32.449
HELP THEMSELVES BEFORE THEY FIND

00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:33.083
THEMSELVES IN CHAPTER ELEVEN AS

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:35.052
WELL.

00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:36.620
THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION I WANT

00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:38.122
TO CLARIFY THOUGH YOU SAID THE

00:42:38.188 --> 00:42:39.590
MAPS ARE DONE AND I THINK YOU'RE

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:40.925
TALKING ABOUT THAT THE THREAT

00:42:40.991 --> 00:42:43.294
DISTRICT MAPS THAT CPUC USES IN

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.929
THE UTILITY ISSUES WHICH IS

00:42:44.995 --> 00:42:46.730
DIFFERENT THAN THE FIRE HAZARDS

00:42:46.797 --> 00:42:48.432
VERITIES ON MAPPING.

00:42:48.499 --> 00:42:49.733
STAR FIRE HAZARD SEVERITIES ON

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.702
MAPPING --%

00:42:51.769 --> 00:42:53.437
IS IS UNDER WAY --

00:42:53.504 --> 00:42:55.406
AND WOULD BE BEGUN THAT PROCESS

00:42:55.472 --> 00:42:57.207
TO UPDATE THAT MAP IN IN THAT

00:42:57.274 --> 00:42:58.509
MAP REFLECTS.

00:42:58.575 --> 00:43:02.379
THE CONDITIONS OF THE WHILE AND

00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:05.349
AND AND AND INTO COMMUNITIES IT

00:43:05.416 --> 00:43:06.850
WARY WORDING CROUCHES.

00:43:06.917 --> 00:43:09.520
THE CPUC AND AND THE UTILITY

00:43:09.586 --> 00:43:10.821
MAPPING --

00:43:10.888 --> 00:43:12.523
WE HAVE AN AMMO YOU WITH WITH

00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:14.792
THE CPUC CAL FIRE DOES --

00:43:14.858 --> 00:43:16.527
WE HAVE A DEDICATED PERSON WHO

00:43:16.593 --> 00:43:18.028
WORKS ALMOST DAILY WITH THEIR

00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:20.331
STAFFING AND THEIR SAFETY

00:43:20.397 --> 00:43:21.832
DIVISION AT CPUC.

00:43:21.899 --> 00:43:23.801
AND WE'VE WE'RE NEARING THE

00:43:23.867 --> 00:43:24.768
COMPLETION OF THE REVIEW OF

00:43:24.835 --> 00:43:26.804
THEIR THEIR WELFARE MITIGATION

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:28.839
PLANS THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO

00:43:28.906 --> 00:43:29.873
SUBMIT -- I

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.275
THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THOSE

00:43:31.342 --> 00:43:32.543
BACK TO CPUC.

00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:34.378
AND THEN I'M NOT SURE THE

00:43:34.445 --> 00:43:35.946
PROCESS AFTER THAT.

00:43:36.013 --> 00:43:38.682
BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO TO

00:43:38.749 --> 00:43:40.250
REVIEW THOSE MAPS AND WE'RE

00:43:40.317 --> 00:43:41.885
MAKING GREAT PROGRESS AND I

00:43:41.952 --> 00:43:42.987
BELIEVE THE DEADLINE IS --

00:43:43.053 --> 00:43:44.688
IS THE NINETEENTH HAVE THOSE

BACK TO CPUC.

00:43:47.157 --> 00:43:49.827
SO IT'S KIND OF TAKEN SOME

00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:51.261
ELEVEN YEARS TO GET THOSE MATT.

00:43:51.328 --> 00:43:53.230
WHAT WHAT MIGHT BE THE REASON?

00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:54.832
FOR IT TAKING SO LONG I'VE THE

00:43:54.898 --> 00:43:56.700

00:44:00.838 --> 00:44:02.740
I I CAN'T RESPOND TO THAT I

00:44:02.806 --> 00:44:03.540
DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WOULD TAKE

00:44:03.607 --> 00:44:04.375
TOO LONG.

GOT TO START IDENTIFYING WHERE

00:44:16.086 --> 00:44:17.054
THE WILD FIRE.

00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:19.056
HIGH RISK ZONES ARE IN.

00:44:19.123 --> 00:44:20.691

00:45:40.437 --> 00:45:42.973
A PART OF OUR WHOLE RESPONSE

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.443
MECHANISMS YES SIR.

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:47.878
ANOTHER THING.

00:45:47.945 --> 00:45:50.681
THAT I HAVE ADVOCATED AND I HOPE

00:45:50.747 --> 00:45:52.249
WE WOULD CONTINUE TO EMBRACE.

00:45:52.316 --> 00:45:54.518
IT WILL REQUIRE.

00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:56.487
MORE SUPPORT FOR CALIFORNIA

00:45:56.553 --> 00:45:59.156
CONSERVATION CORPS.

00:45:59.223 --> 00:46:00.958
BUT I BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE GOING

00:46:01.024 --> 00:46:03.627
TO BE OUR MAIN STAY RESOURCE THE

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:04.528
FUTURE.

00:46:04.595 --> 00:46:06.597
WHERE BY FOR DECADES WE RELY TOO

00:46:06.663 --> 00:46:08.799
MUCH ON IN MAY LABOR?

00:46:08.866 --> 00:46:11.201
INMATE LABOR IS NO LONGER IS

00:46:11.268 --> 00:46:12.069
RELIABLE.

00:46:12.136 --> 00:46:14.304
OR IS AVAILABLE.

00:46:14.371 --> 00:46:16.840
ARE YOU LOOKING AT NEW

00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:18.742
RELATIONSHIPS WITH SEE SEE SEE

00:46:18.809 --> 00:46:19.776
IF WE CAN.

00:46:19.843 --> 00:46:22.112
GET THEM FUND.

00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:23.180
WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP

00:46:23.247 --> 00:46:26.416
WITH THE CCC'S AS IT RELATES TO

00:46:26.483 --> 00:46:27.718
OUR FIRE TACK CRUISE SO.

00:46:27.784 --> 00:46:29.753
SENATOR I WOULD LIKE TO GET BACK

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:31.889
WITH YOU ON THAT DEFERRED THAT

00:46:31.955 --> 00:46:33.290
TO OUR OPERATIONS FOLKS.

00:46:33.357 --> 00:46:34.258
I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO

00:46:34.324 --> 00:46:35.926
PREVENTION DOESN'T SPEAK FOR

00:46:35.993 --> 00:46:37.928
OPERATIONS AND I WANT TO GET IN

00:46:37.995 --> 00:46:38.562
THEY'LL GET AHEAD.

00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:39.897
AT SNAGGING IT WELL IT WAS IT

00:46:39.963 --> 00:46:41.999
WAS IT AN INSTRUCTIVE THAT LAST

00:46:42.065 --> 00:46:44.701
YEAR WE WERE ABLE TO GET A SHE

00:46:44.768 --> 00:46:47.404
SHE SHE CAP OPENED UP IN

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:48.972
PARADISE.

00:46:49.039 --> 00:46:49.940
AND AT LEAST IT WAS TO A DEGREE

00:46:50.007 --> 00:46:50.541
HELPFUL.

00:46:50.607 --> 00:46:53.010
THAT THAT WAS DONE.

00:46:53.076 --> 00:46:56.180
AND ALSO ANOTHER FACTOR IS THE

00:46:56.246 --> 00:46:58.448
SURVEILLANCE TO IDENTIFY THE

00:46:58.515 --> 00:47:00.484
FIGHTERS.

00:47:00.551 --> 00:47:02.252
THAT REQUIRES NO MORE

00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:03.720
APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY.

00:47:03.787 --> 00:47:06.557
CAMERAS IT CETERA. TO IDENTIFY

00:47:06.623 --> 00:47:10.194
FIRES WE USED TO HEAD THE OF

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.995
TOWERS ALL OVER THE PLACE.

00:47:12.062 --> 00:47:14.565
WITH PEOPLE STATIONED THERE.

00:47:14.631 --> 00:47:15.832
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THE FIRE

00:47:15.899 --> 00:47:17.701
SEASON --

00:47:17.768 --> 00:47:20.170
BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS WE'RE

00:47:20.237 --> 00:47:22.206
DEVELOPING A LOT NEW TECHNOLOGY

00:47:22.272 --> 00:47:23.607
THAT CAN GIVE US.

00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:25.642
SURVEILLANCE OUT IN THE FORCE TO

00:47:25.709 --> 00:47:28.045
WILD LANDS.

00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:29.746
THE TO IDENTIFY FIRES.

00:47:29.813 --> 00:47:31.782
SOONER IS THAT CORRECT YES

00:47:31.848 --> 00:47:34.418
THAT'S CORRECT AND THEN ALSO AN

00:47:34.484 --> 00:47:35.786
ISSUE THAT HAS COME TO BEAR

00:47:35.852 --> 00:47:38.121
WE'RE DEALING WITH IT EVEN RIGHT

00:47:38.188 --> 00:47:39.690
NOW IN THE LEGISLATURE.

00:47:39.756 --> 00:47:41.625
AND THAT'S RAPID RESPONSE AND

00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:43.660
COMMUNICATION OF IDENTIFICATION

00:47:43.727 --> 00:47:45.896
AND NOTIFICATION [inaudible] TO

00:47:45.963 --> 00:47:47.831

WELL BACK TO ASIANS.

00:47:49.266 --> 00:47:51.435
THAT IS ALSO A PART OF YOUR PLAN

00:47:51.501 --> 00:47:52.903
FOR THE FUTURE CORRECT I WORKING

POSITIONING AND PLACING

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.178
RESOURCES.

00:48:01.245 --> 00:48:02.713
IN MOST LIKELY MOST VULNERABLE

00:48:02.779 --> 00:48:05.215
HIGH RISK AREAS AND ARE YOU

00:48:05.282 --> 00:48:06.583

00:55:34.264 --> 00:55:36.533
ACTION BEFORE THE DISASTER

00:55:36.599 --> 00:55:38.735

EARLIER.

00:55:41.271 --> 00:55:43.606
EFFECTIVE MEDICATION REQUIRES --

00:55:43.673 --> 00:55:45.608
THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND FIRST OF

00:55:45.675 --> 00:55:46.943
ALL WHAT THE RISKS ARE AT THE

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:48.278
LOCAL LEVEL AND THEN THE

THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHERE WE

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:43.326
ACTUALLY WOULD INCENTIVIZE

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:46.295

THAT.

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:19.929
THEY'RE NOT THINKING.

01:04:44.614 --> 01:04:46.349
RESULTING IN LARGER SCALE

01:04:46.415 --> 01:04:47.717
COMMUNITY FIRE PROTECTION

01:04:47.783 --> 01:04:49.151
EFFORTS OKAY.

01:04:49.218 --> 01:04:50.620
MAYBE WORKING WITH CAL FIRE IN

01:04:50.686 --> 01:04:52.288
IN BEING ABLE TO AND FEMA BEING

01:04:52.355 --> 01:04:54.624
ABLE TO CHANGE THE WHAT COULD BE

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:56.225
DETERMINED TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:58.628
DEFENSIBLE SPACE --

01:04:58.694 --> 01:05:01.430
DOING RETROFITS.

01:05:01.497 --> 01:05:02.965
WITH REGARDS --

01:05:03.032 --> 01:05:05.001
TO TYPES OF ROOFING AND OTHER

01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:08.304
KINDS OF YVHS --

01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:10.006
WINDOWS --

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:11.741
SCREENS KIND OF THINGS --

01:05:11.807 --> 01:05:13.175
EXPLORING THE POTENTIAL FOR

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:14.944
STRATEGIC LANDS PURCHASES AND

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:16.078
HIGH FIRE.

01:05:16.145 --> 01:05:18.314
HAZARD ZONE SIMILAR TO WHAT'S

01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:19.949
THE POINT IN FLOOD PLAINS.

01:05:20.016 --> 01:05:21.651
ALL OF THESE ARE THINGS THAT --

01:05:21.717 --> 01:05:23.653
ARE POTENTIAL WITH REGARDS TO

01:05:23.719 --> 01:05:26.856
HAZARD MITIGATION PROGRAMS AND

01:05:26.922 --> 01:05:31.060
AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW --

01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:32.795
ONE THIS IS NOT JUST A FEDERAL

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:34.897
STATE PROGRAM THIS IS A FEDERAL

01:05:34.964 --> 01:05:36.332
STATE LOCAL --

01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:38.834
NON GOVERNMENTAL COMMUNITY BASED

01:05:38.901 --> 01:05:41.437
LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENGAGEMENT

01:05:41.504 --> 01:05:42.138
WHICH MEANS THAT.

01:05:42.204 --> 01:05:43.039
YOU KNOW --

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:44.473
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT BUILDING

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:46.942
A SUBDIVISION OR HOMES IN A HIGH

01:05:47.009 --> 01:05:48.678
RISK ZONE AREA I DON'T REALLY

01:05:48.744 --> 01:05:50.446
CARE WHAT THE RISK IS BUT?

01:05:50.513 --> 01:05:51.681
WE ARE GOING TO BUILD IN THE

01:05:51.747 --> 01:05:53.182
HIGH RISK ZONE AREA --

01:05:53.249 --> 01:05:55.184
AND YOU COME UP AGAINST --

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:57.586
THE ISSUE OF WE DO WE BUILD WE

01:05:57.653 --> 01:05:59.055
MITIGATE HOW WE MITIGATE.

01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:00.089
AND THEN YOU HAVE DEVELOPERS

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:01.857
THAT ARE WORKING TO MINIMIZE

01:06:01.924 --> 01:06:04.427
THAT EFFORT AND THEN ULTIMATELY

01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:06.495
THE SUBDIVISION GETS BUILT --

01:06:06.562 --> 01:06:08.230
I THINK THAT THERE'S THERE'S A A

01:06:08.297 --> 01:06:12.501
PIECE IN THAT AREA WHERE WE ALL

01:06:12.568 --> 01:06:13.502
NEED TO COLLECTIVELY BE.

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:44.860
BUILDING A A MORE RESILIENT

01:07:44.927 --> 01:07:45.728
COMMUNITIES AS THE BEST WAY TO

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:20.729
ROOM RECOMMEND THAT THE PUBLIC

TO BE USE.

01:10:20.683 --> 01:10:22.051
THOSE PROJECTS COULD BE USED FOR

01:10:22.117 --> 01:10:23.819
DEFENSIBLE SPACE MEASURES SAYING

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:25.120
NEXT IGNITION RESISTING

CONSTRUCTION.

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:29.458
EARLIER THAT YEAR I THINK IT'S

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:32.061
FROM THE QUESTIONS YOU'RE SING

01:10:32.127 --> 01:10:33.596
HOMES -- ONE

01:10:33.662 --> 01:10:34.597
OF THE THINGS THAT --

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:36.098
WE'VE DONE IS PROVIDE MITIGATION

01:10:36.165 --> 01:10:37.800

CODES IN THOSE KIND OF THINGS

01:10:42.838 --> 01:10:44.640
AND WHO DID THAT WAS TRICKY FIRE

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:46.075
DEPARTMENT TOOK ON THAT A GRANT

IN THE AREA. TO TO DO THAT --

01:10:50.479 --> 01:10:51.013
THE OTHER THING --

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.681
THE BIGGEST COMMIT MONEY COULD

01:10:52.748 --> 01:10:54.650
BE USED FOR AS HAZARDOUS --

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:56.885
FUELS REDUCTION --

01:10:56.952 --> 01:10:57.920

NOW WE'RE SEEING THESE ALLTHE

01:13:42.451 --> 01:13:43.786
TIME --

01:13:43.852 --> 01:13:45.521

01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:47.589
CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED THE THE

01:13:47.656 --> 01:13:49.424
ENVIRONMENT CHANGED I THINK THAT

01:13:49.491 --> 01:13:51.026
FIVE YEARS OF DROUGHT WAS A HUGE

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:53.028
FACTOR --

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:53.629
THESE ARE ALL CLIMATE DRIVEN

01:13:53.695 --> 01:13:55.097
ISSUES --

01:13:55.164 --> 01:14:00.969
AND THE WE SCENIC IN KIRK'S MOVE

01:14:01.036 --> 01:14:03.739
OF OF PEOPLE FROM URBAN CENTERS

01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:06.442
TO THOUGH WE WE INTO AREAS WHERE

01:14:06.508 --> 01:14:07.476
THEY'RE GETTING CUT OUT OF THE

01:14:07.543 --> 01:14:10.145
RAT RACE AND THAT THAT PUTS MORE.

01:14:10.212 --> 01:14:11.547
PEOPLE AT RISK --

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:12.881
AND THEN LASTLY --

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:13.782
WE'VE MOVED WE'VE SEEN A

01:14:13.849 --> 01:14:15.651
TREMENDOUS SHIFT TO THE USE OF

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:17.619
TECHNOLOGY THE USE OF CELL

01:14:17.686 --> 01:14:19.388
PHONES FOR COMMUNICATION AND THE

01:14:19.454 --> 01:14:21.623
REQUIREMENT OF HAVING --

01:14:21.690 --> 01:14:23.492
THE BACKBONE OF THE RESILIENCY

01:14:23.559 --> 01:14:24.960
THAT SYSTEM --

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:26.829
THEY WERE ALL UTILIZING --

01:14:26.895 --> 01:14:28.797
BE BE QUESTIONABLE SO THOSE ARE

01:14:28.864 --> 01:14:30.065
THOSE ARE I WOULD SAVE IN IN MY

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:30.899
TIME --

01:14:30.966 --> 01:14:32.334
WHERE WE'RE SEEING A MUCH MORE

01:14:32.401 --> 01:14:34.002
COMPLEX SITUATION YEAH I THINK

01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:35.137
IT'S THE RATES FOR STAND THAT

01:14:35.204 --> 01:14:38.106
ISSUE OF TELECOM IN NEEDING MORE

01:14:38.173 --> 01:14:39.741
RESILIENT SYSTEM WHEN IT COMES

01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:43.011
TO TELECOM KEEPING --

01:14:43.078 --> 01:14:43.912
THOSE OPERATIONS NO MATTER WHO

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:46.515
THE KERRIER IS MOVING DURING --

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:48.283
IN EVACUATION AND OR IN THE

01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:51.186
AFTERMATH AS WE SEE THE SYSTEMS

01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:52.354
EVEN SOME OF THE SMALLER VEINS

01:14:52.421 --> 01:14:53.622
AND PLEASE PUSH BACK ON ME IF

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:54.656
YOU THINK I'M WRONG.

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:57.059
THE SMALLER VENCER COLLAPSING

01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:58.727
ENTIRE REGIONS WHEN IT COMES TO

01:14:58.794 --> 01:15:00.062
SELLING DATA FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S

01:15:00.128 --> 01:15:01.463
THAT'S CORRECT AND I MEAN YOU

01:15:01.530 --> 01:15:02.497
KNOW WE KNOW THAT IN OUR RULE

01:15:02.564 --> 01:15:04.166
AREAS WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:05.033
MOVING.

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:07.436
THE SERVICES ARE ARE NOT YET UP

01:15:07.502 --> 01:15:09.371
TO SPEED ANYWAY --

01:15:09.438 --> 01:15:10.339
AND THEN AND THEN OF COURSE THE

01:15:10.405 --> 01:15:11.807
CAPABILITY THAT EXISTS THERE

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:14.443
EVEN IN A MODERATE OR A SMALLER

01:15:14.509 --> 01:15:16.178
BAD THOSE SYSTEMS --

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:17.713
ARE GOING DOWN AND SO --

01:15:17.779 --> 01:15:19.147
IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT WE ALL

01:15:19.214 --> 01:15:23.051
NEED TO COLLECTIVELY WORK ON BUT

01:15:23.118 --> 01:15:26.221
IT'S IT'S IT'S A ABOUT SOME OF

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:28.223
THESE THINGS AND AT PEOPLE THEY

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:29.658
JUST THEY JUST ALL STEP UP AND

01:15:29.725 --> 01:15:31.860
AND AND CONSIDER.

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:32.527
THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO DEPEND ON

01:15:32.594 --> 01:15:33.328
IT.

01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:34.830
IN OUR LIVES ARE DEPENDING ON IT

01:15:34.897 --> 01:15:36.098
IT HAS TO BE RESILIENT AND

01:15:36.164 --> 01:15:38.166
REDUNDANT.

01:15:38.233 --> 01:15:38.767
THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR MISTER

FEMA MOST THAT HERE IN REGION

01:15:42.604 --> 01:15:44.439
NINE I I THINK I'VE SEEN --

01:15:44.506 --> 01:15:46.475
A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OVER THAT

01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:47.776
TIME OF FIRES.

01:15:47.843 --> 01:15:49.144
I THINK --

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:50.712
MOST NOTABLY IS --

01:15:50.779 --> 01:15:52.481
JUST THE WIND DRIVEN FIRES THAT

01:15:52.547 --> 01:15:53.782
WERE SEEN NOWADAYS THE LAST

01:15:53.849 --> 01:15:55.584
COUPLE YEARS AND FIRE TORNADOES

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:57.185
AND THINGS THAT WE JUST REALLY

01:15:57.252 --> 01:15:59.054
HAVEN'T SEEN EVER BEFORE --

01:15:59.121 --> 01:16:01.223
A AND AND JUST --

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:03.058
THE FIRES NINETY MOVING OUT OF

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:04.559
THE FOREST AREA BUT INTO URBAN

01:16:04.626 --> 01:16:07.996
INTERFACE --

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:10.933
E. YOUNG THE SANTA ROSA JUST A

01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:12.234
BIG CHANGE OVER THE LAST COUPLE

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:15.604
YEARS AT LEAST.

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:18.006
GOT IT --

01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:19.775
WE'RE DUE TO MORE RAPID FIRE AND

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:21.109
TURNED OVER TO THE COMMITTEE

01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:22.644
WHAT CHANGES.

01:16:22.711 --> 01:16:24.079
SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT IN

01:16:24.146 --> 01:16:25.714
REGARDS TO THE LOCAL PLANNING

01:16:25.781 --> 01:16:26.882
DECISIONS [inaudible]

01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:29.685
AND CAN GUIDELINES CUT IT

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:31.720
ANYMORE.

01:16:31.787 --> 01:16:32.821
OR DO WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:35.023
WITH MANDATES WHICH WAS THE SAME

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:36.658
QUESTION FOR THE FARMERS.

01:16:36.725 --> 01:16:39.461
STRICTER.

01:16:39.528 --> 01:16:40.929
WELL I MEAN AS A AS A BUBBLE

01:16:40.996 --> 01:16:44.967
POPPING I MENTIONED YOU KNOW --

01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:46.268
YOUR MEDICATION HAS TO BE AN

01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:48.303
INTEGRAL COMPONENT TO THE

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:50.238
PLANNING PROCESS YOUR GENERAL

01:16:50.305 --> 01:16:51.473
PLANS --

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:54.343
NEED TO HAVE A HAND IN GLOVE

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:56.445
WITH YOUR MITIGATION PLAN --

01:16:56.511 --> 01:16:58.180
I YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE WORD

01:16:58.246 --> 01:17:00.148
MANDATE HAS BECOME.

01:17:00.215 --> 01:17:03.418
ALL YOU KNOW CONCERNING --

01:17:03.485 --> 01:17:05.620
I THINK IN CERTAIN AREAS OF

01:17:05.687 --> 01:17:07.589
PUBLIC SAFETY --

01:17:07.656 --> 01:17:08.824
I DON'T CARE FOR STATE

01:17:08.890 --> 01:17:11.426
GOVERNMENT OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT --

01:17:11.493 --> 01:17:13.228
OR OR RESPONSIBILITY OF A OF A

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:14.463
COMMUNITY YOU HAVE A

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:17.065
RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMMUNITY --

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:18.900
WE ALL SHOULD BE WE ALL SHOULD

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:21.536
BE FOCUSED ON MAKING THAT THE

01:17:21.603 --> 01:17:23.238
MOST SAFE ISN'T SECURE NOW

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:24.473
SOMETIMES --

01:17:24.539 --> 01:17:26.575
COST GETS IN THE WAY --

01:17:26.641 --> 01:17:27.776
AND I THINK THAT THERE'S THERE'S

01:17:27.843 --> 01:17:29.411
GOT TO BE A BETTER DIALOGUE AND

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:30.212
BEING ABLE TO WALK TO WORK

01:17:30.278 --> 01:17:31.213
THROUGH THAT --

01:17:31.279 --> 01:17:33.148
AS WE JUST ARTICULATED HERE

01:17:33.215 --> 01:17:36.451
THERE ARE OTHER KINDS OF THINGS

01:17:36.518 --> 01:17:39.287
TO BUY DOWN THE COSTS --

01:17:39.354 --> 01:17:40.522
SO I THINK THAT --

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:42.190
WERE YOU SEE MANDATE --

01:17:42.257 --> 01:17:42.991
I I THINK FROM A LOCAL

01:17:43.058 --> 01:17:44.326
GOVERNMENT A LOCAL PLANNING

THINK THAT IN THE NEW NORMAL --

01:17:53.735 --> 01:17:55.170
THEY NEED TO BE THINKING AOUT

01:17:55.237 --> 01:17:57.639
AS THEY APPROVE --

01:17:57.706 --> 01:18:00.575
PLANS OR IF THEY'RE LOOKING AT

01:18:00.642 --> 01:18:02.544
APPROVING A PERMIT FOR A RETRO

01:18:02.611 --> 01:18:03.678
FIT -- THAT

01:18:03.745 --> 01:18:05.213
THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE ENCOURAGED

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.782
THAT THAT THAT THERE ACTUALLY IS

01:18:06.848 --> 01:18:08.717
REQUIREMENTS FOR THEM TO

01:18:08.784 --> 01:18:09.351
ACTUALLY BUILD THAT IN THE PLACE

01:18:09.418 --> 01:18:10.385
AND THEN.

01:18:10.452 --> 01:18:10.852
LASTLY THERE HAS TO BE

01:18:10.919 --> 01:18:12.254
ENFORCEMENT --

PRACTICAL --

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:20.382
IF COMMITTEES ARE GOING TO BUILD

01:20:20.448 --> 01:20:21.917

01:22:17.832 --> 01:22:19.734
ON THIS SORT OF HAZARD

01:22:19.801 --> 01:22:21.703

THE TABLE BY NOT TAKING

01:22:28.009 --> 01:22:28.476
ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF THESE

01:22:28.543 --> 01:22:30.612
PROGRAMS.

NEVER GIVE ANY MONEY BACK TO THE

TABLE.

01:22:41.823 --> 01:22:43.058
LIKE A PLACE THAT I I I I THINK

01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:44.125
THAT -- I

01:22:44.192 --> 01:22:48.096
THINK THAT IT HAS TO DO WITH --

01:22:48.163 --> 01:22:49.464
THE KIND OF PRICE SOMETIMES

01:22:49.531 --> 01:22:50.799
WRAPPING UP HOLD.

01:22:50.865 --> 01:22:52.967
VERSUS YOU KNOW PUSH AND PULL --

01:22:53.034 --> 01:22:55.270
THE GET GOOD PROJECTS I THINK

01:22:55.337 --> 01:22:56.938
THAT --

01:22:57.005 --> 01:22:58.440
MAYBE I'M GONNA GET YOU PROGRAM

01:22:58.506 --> 01:23:00.442
IS NOT AS AND THE AVAILABILITY

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:01.943
OF THE RESOURCES ARE NOT AS

01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:04.145
UNDERSTOOD IS THEY SHOULD BE --

01:23:04.212 --> 01:23:06.514
WE WE WE ALWAYS TRY TO FIND WE

01:23:06.581 --> 01:23:08.950
GET THE PROJECTS ACROSS THE

01:23:09.017 --> 01:23:09.851
BOARD --

01:23:09.918 --> 01:23:13.154
DONE BUT I WOULD JUST --

01:23:13.221 --> 01:23:14.389
YOU KNOW IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:23:14.456 --> 01:23:16.157
THE THE COMMUNITIES REALLY NEED

01:23:16.224 --> 01:23:16.791
TO THINK ABOUT BECAUSE THERE IS

01:23:16.858 --> 01:23:17.926
A COST SHARE.

01:23:17.992 --> 01:23:19.361
LET'S BE CLEAR ON THAT RIGHT AND

01:23:19.427 --> 01:23:21.496
SOMETIMES THAT COST YEAR IS HARD

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:22.997
FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO MEET.

01:23:23.064 --> 01:23:24.466
AND SO THEY JUST DON'T GO DOWN

01:23:24.532 --> 01:23:25.867
THAT PATHWAY.

01:23:25.934 --> 01:23:27.102
AND SO WE'VE LOOKED AT WAYS THAT

01:23:27.168 --> 01:23:29.637
MAY BE.

01:23:29.704 --> 01:23:31.473
FEELING THAT COST SHARE THROUGH

01:23:31.539 --> 01:23:33.208
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS OR

01:23:33.274 --> 01:23:35.510
OTHER KINDS OF WAYS TO TO MAKE

01:23:35.577 --> 01:23:36.945
IT EASIER SOME.

01:23:37.011 --> 01:23:38.380
WEALTHIER COMMUNITIES THIS

01:23:38.446 --> 01:23:40.081
SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM SOME ARE

01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:41.649
SMALL RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT

01:23:41.716 --> 01:23:43.084
BARELY CAN DO THAT.

01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:45.920
BENNY LE MORE HELP GETTING THERE

01:23:45.987 --> 01:23:47.322
SO WHAT I WOULD HAVE IMAGINED.

01:23:47.389 --> 01:23:48.256
JUDGE WHAT KIND OF PROJECTS WE

01:23:48.323 --> 01:23:49.691
TALK ABOUT YOUR THE WHAT WHAT

01:23:49.758 --> 01:23:50.492
WHAT ARE.

01:23:50.558 --> 01:23:51.259
I I THINK --

01:23:51.326 --> 01:23:56.064
BY MANY OF MANY OF THE IF IT

01:23:56.131 --> 01:23:58.767
CONTACTS A WALL FIRE IS IS MAYBE

01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:01.269
IT'S REALIGNMENT OF ROADS COULD

01:24:01.336 --> 01:24:02.637
BE -- TO

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:03.938
MAKE YOU KNOW BETTER VALUATIONS

01:24:04.005 --> 01:24:05.407
ALWAYS MAYBE ITSELF ALERT AND

01:24:05.473 --> 01:24:06.741

TO MAKE SO.

01:31:48.369 --> 01:31:50.238
SO THERE ARE PROJECTS WE CAN DO

01:31:50.304 --> 01:31:51.272
WE LOOK AT EVERYTHING FROM A

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:53.407
BENEFIT COST ANALYSIS WE HAVE TO

01:31:53.474 --> 01:31:54.275
MAKE SURE IT COMPLIES WITH DEEP

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:56.043

01:32:07.521 --> 01:32:08.623
WE CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE THE

01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:10.191
MITIGATION MONIES COME FROM

01:32:10.258 --> 01:32:11.292

IF WE HAVE ADDITIONAL WE HAVE

01:32:30.444 --> 01:32:32.146

WE WE HAVE SEEN OUR SHARE OF

01:32:38.319 --> 01:32:42.757
DISASTERS I THINK WE HAVE BEEN

01:32:42.823 --> 01:32:44.058
ABLE.

01:32:44.125 --> 01:32:46.460
TO FIGHT THEM TO REDUCE THE AND

01:32:46.527 --> 01:32:48.963
MITIGATE THE IMPACTS PROBABLY

01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:50.064
BETTER THAN ANY OTHER STATE.

01:32:50.131 --> 01:32:54.568
OUR OUR MUTUAL AID PROGRAM

01:32:54.635 --> 01:32:56.671
EVERYTHING I THINK IS IS THE

01:32:56.737 --> 01:32:58.105
MODEL FOR THE COUNTRY.

01:32:58.172 --> 01:32:59.607
AND APPRECIATE THAT AND I WOULD

01:32:59.674 --> 01:33:01.676
AGREE I DON'T USUALLY SPEAK

01:33:01.742 --> 01:33:03.110
MISTER MCGUIRE LANGUAGE SHE'S

01:33:03.177 --> 01:33:04.879
TOO YOUNG FOR ME BUT THIS IS THE

01:33:04.946 --> 01:33:07.782
DYNAMIC DO WELL HERE --

01:33:07.848 --> 01:33:09.684
IN TERMS OF THE WORK THAT YOU'VE

01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:11.819
DONE BOTH WITH THE STATE THE

01:33:11.886 --> 01:33:13.020
MISTER GELLER TO CHI AND OF

01:33:13.087 --> 01:33:13.888
COURSE --

01:33:13.955 --> 01:33:16.157
WITH FAMOUS WELL --

01:33:16.223 --> 01:33:18.326
BUT THAT BEING SAID TO ME WE WE

01:33:18.392 --> 01:33:19.927
ARE AS GOOD AS WE ARE IN GREAT.

01:33:19.994 --> 01:33:21.462
MEASURE BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD

01:33:21.529 --> 01:33:23.731
EXPERIENCE IN THIS WE'VE SEEN A

01:33:23.798 --> 01:33:25.366
NUMBER OF THESE.

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:27.601
NATURAL DISASTERS FOR DECADES

01:33:27.668 --> 01:33:30.171
AND AND WE ARE GETTING A BETTER.

01:33:30.237 --> 01:33:30.838
SADLY -- AND

01:33:30.905 --> 01:33:34.141
BETTER THROUGH EACH ONE OF THESE --

01:33:34.208 --> 01:33:40.915
BUT I'M I'M KIND OF HOW WE CAN

01:33:40.982 --> 01:33:42.550
ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS IN

01:33:42.616 --> 01:33:43.884
ADVANCE.

01:33:43.951 --> 01:33:45.686
BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE INCIDENTS

01:33:45.753 --> 01:33:47.788
OCCUR AND PEOPLE THINK OVER IT'S

01:33:47.855 --> 01:33:49.657
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN HERE --

01:33:49.724 --> 01:33:51.559
AND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A

01:33:51.625 --> 01:33:54.362
LOT OF THIS HARDENING AND SO

01:33:54.428 --> 01:33:56.297
FORTH ARE EXPENSIVE --

01:33:56.364 --> 01:33:57.698
SO.

01:33:57.765 --> 01:33:59.166
WE ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM I HAVE TO

01:33:59.233 --> 01:34:00.167
SHARE WTH YOU SOMEONE WHO LIVES

01:34:00.234 --> 01:34:02.770
NOT TOO FAR FROM WHERE THE

01:34:02.837 --> 01:34:05.172
THOMAS FIRE ENDED IN WHERE THE

01:34:05.239 --> 01:34:06.540
DEBRIS FLOW OCCURRED --

01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:08.376
INSURANCE.

01:34:08.442 --> 01:34:10.811
IS A REALLY SERIOUS PROBLEM THE

01:34:10.878 --> 01:34:12.580
PEOPLE WHO LIVE WITHIN THOSE

01:34:12.646 --> 01:34:14.048
AREAS ARE FINDING IF THEIR

01:34:14.115 --> 01:34:16.751
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE WILLING.

01:34:16.817 --> 01:34:18.052
TO EVEN.

01:34:18.119 --> 01:34:20.721
EXTEND INSURANCE ARE TRIPLING

01:34:20.788 --> 01:34:22.289
AND QUADRUPLING THE COST OF

01:34:22.356 --> 01:34:24.992
PREMIUMS MAKING FOR SOME PEOPLE

01:34:25.059 --> 01:34:26.427
DIFFICULT IF NOT UNAFFORDABLE.

01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:27.762
OTHERS OF US ARE GETTING NON

01:34:27.828 --> 01:34:29.563
RENEWED.

01:34:29.630 --> 01:34:31.532
BECAUSE WE LIVE IN QUOTE UNQUOTE

01:34:31.599 --> 01:34:32.800
HIGH RISK AREAS.

01:34:32.867 --> 01:34:35.102
SO I I SUSPECT THAT WILL BE A

01:34:35.169 --> 01:34:37.405
LITTLE BIT OF AN INCENTIVE BUT I

01:34:37.471 --> 01:34:39.407
WONDER IF THERE ARE SOME THINGS

01:34:39.473 --> 01:34:41.175
THAT WE CAN DO JUST GIVEN THE

01:34:41.242 --> 01:34:42.977
HUMAN NATURE AS WE ALWAYS TEND

01:34:43.044 --> 01:34:45.246
TO CLOSE THE BARN DOOR AFTER THE

01:34:45.312 --> 01:34:46.480
ANIMALS OF LEFT.

01:34:46.547 --> 01:34:48.783
ANY OTHER INCENTIVES THAT MIGHT

01:34:48.849 --> 01:34:50.217
EXIST THROUGH THE STATE.

01:34:50.284 --> 01:34:52.153
THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:34:52.219 --> 01:34:53.754
TO NOT ONLY GET OUR COMMUNITIES

01:34:53.821 --> 01:34:55.623
TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CANDID

01:34:55.689 --> 01:34:57.224
ABOUT.

01:34:57.291 --> 01:34:58.759
WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO WE HAVE A

01:34:58.826 --> 01:34:59.927
NUMBER OF?

01:34:59.994 --> 01:35:01.362
STREETS IN MY COMMUNITY THERE

01:35:01.429 --> 01:35:03.230
ONE WAY OUT.

01:35:03.297 --> 01:35:04.465
WE WERE UP IN THE HILLS IT'S AT

01:35:04.532 --> 01:35:06.000
THE PROBABLY I THINK FOR THE

01:35:06.067 --> 01:35:06.901
MOST BEAUTIFUL PARTS OF

01:35:06.967 --> 01:35:08.035
CALIFORNIA.

01:35:08.102 --> 01:35:09.336
BUT THERE'S A COST ASSOCIATED

01:35:09.403 --> 01:35:10.671
WITH LIVING THERE.

01:35:10.738 --> 01:35:11.472
AND THESE ARE RISKS THAT PEOPLE

01:35:11.539 --> 01:35:13.607
TELL --

01:35:13.674 --> 01:35:15.443
UNTIL THEY HAPPEN.

01:35:15.509 --> 01:35:17.745
AND IT'S JUST THE HUMAN I GUESS

01:35:17.812 --> 01:35:19.747
WHAT I I'M INTERESTED IN IS THE

01:35:19.814 --> 01:35:21.115
HUMAN NATURE FACTOR.

01:35:21.182 --> 01:35:22.783
THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH WHETHER

01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:24.919
IT'S A CITY PLANNING FINALS BEEN

01:35:24.985 --> 01:35:26.954
BIG RESISTANCE IN IN THE

01:35:27.021 --> 01:35:28.789
MONASHEE TO WORRY ABOUT LIFTING

01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:32.126
HOMES UP FIFTEEN FEET REBUILDING --

01:35:32.193 --> 01:35:34.595
UP AND THE COSTS OF SAUDI

01:35:34.662 --> 01:35:35.396
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ARE

01:35:35.463 --> 01:35:37.231
ENORMOUS A LOT OF PEOPLE AREN'T

01:35:37.298 --> 01:35:37.865
GOING TO WANT TO REBUILD THAT

01:35:37.932 --> 01:35:39.333
WAY AND YET WHAT WE'RE TALKING

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:40.701
ABOUT IS A TOTALLY IMPERFECT

01:35:40.768 --> 01:35:41.735
SCIENCE WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE

01:35:41.802 --> 01:35:44.572
NEXT EVENTS GOING TO BE.

01:35:44.638 --> 01:35:45.172
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO

01:35:45.239 --> 01:35:46.240
BE A TORNADO.

01:35:46.307 --> 01:35:47.241
I MEAN IT'S A YOU KNOW LET'S

01:35:47.308 --> 01:35:49.510
LET'S FACE CLIMATE CHANGES HERE

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:51.946
IN ITS IN ITS WREAKING HAVOC.

01:35:52.012 --> 01:35:54.215
ON THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY --

01:35:54.281 --> 01:35:55.983
WHAT DO WE TELL THE PEOPLE IN

01:35:56.050 --> 01:35:57.818
THE SO CALLED HIGH RISK AREAS

01:35:57.885 --> 01:35:58.953
BECAUSE I CAN'T THINK OF PARTY

01:35:59.019 --> 01:36:00.955
CALIFORNIA TODAY THAT ISN'T HIGH

01:36:01.021 --> 01:36:02.456
RISK -- DO

01:36:02.523 --> 01:36:03.991
WE LET THE INSURANCE COMPANIES

01:36:04.058 --> 01:36:06.894
COME IN AND JUST BURY US.

01:36:06.961 --> 01:36:08.996
WITH HIGH COST INSURANCE

01:36:09.063 --> 01:36:11.699
PREMIUMS TO WE TRY TO WORK WITH

01:36:11.765 --> 01:36:13.934
OUR CITIES AND OUR COUNTIES TO

01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:14.935
FORCE THEM TO DO.

01:36:15.002 --> 01:36:16.203
SOME MAKE SOME VERY TOUGH

01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:20.574
DECISIONS THAT ARE NOT POPULAR --

01:36:20.641 --> 01:36:21.509
THE END AND YET YOUR USER

01:36:21.575 --> 01:36:23.043
THERE'S MONEY WE'RE LEAVING ON

01:36:23.110 --> 01:36:24.411
THE TABLE TO DO THIS.

01:36:24.478 --> 01:36:25.913
MAYBE IT'S MAYBE I'M ASKING A

01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:27.314
QUESTION THAT REALLY IS THE

01:36:27.381 --> 01:36:29.450
RESPONSIBILITY OF OF US AS

01:36:29.517 --> 01:36:31.485

01:36:41.462 --> 01:36:43.130
LET THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY OFF

01:36:43.197 --> 01:36:44.298
THE HOOK HERE.

01:36:44.365 --> 01:36:45.933
ARE THEY RAISING PREMIUMS JUST

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.268
BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED RISK

01:36:47.334 --> 01:36:49.170
FACTOR OR THEY DOING IT TO BE

01:36:49.236 --> 01:36:50.804

THE CHAIR [inaudible]

01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:32.299
THANK YOU. ONE ONE POINT FOR THE

01:49:32.365 --> 01:49:33.033
QUESTION DRILLING DOWN A LITTLE

01:49:33.099 --> 01:49:34.434
FURTHER MAYBE IN FOLLOW UP ABOUT

01:49:34.501 --> 01:49:35.936
WHAT THAT THRESHOLD IS BETWEEN

01:49:36.002 --> 01:49:37.070
MITIGATE HERBAL.

01:49:37.137 --> 01:49:39.039
RISK FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD

01:49:39.105 --> 01:49:40.240
VERSUS.

01:49:40.307 --> 01:49:41.641
IF IT'S TO THICK WHAT'S THAT

01:49:41.708 --> 01:49:44.110
THRESHOLD WHAT RIGHT.

01:49:44.177 --> 01:49:44.711
WHERE DO YOU DRESS THE TALKING

01:49:44.778 --> 01:49:46.713
WITH SOME DEVELOPMENTS IN THE

01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:47.480
SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS?

01:49:47.547 --> 01:49:48.915
THAT'S THAT'S A BIG CONCERN AND

01:49:48.982 --> 01:49:50.016
I THINK THERE'S A WAY TO MANAGE

01:49:50.083 --> 01:49:51.952
THAT OPEN SPACE INTELLIGENTLY IF

01:49:52.018 --> 01:49:52.585
WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DEVELOP THEIR

01:49:52.652 --> 01:49:54.487
BUT IS.

01:49:54.554 --> 01:49:55.755
I'M I'M ASSUMING FROM WHAT

01:49:55.822 --> 01:49:56.856
YOU'RE SAYING IT'S IT'S IT'S

01:49:56.923 --> 01:49:59.492
SORT OF A GRAY AREA IS GRAY.

01:49:59.559 --> 01:50:01.962
COMPLEX AND AND IT DOES REQUIRE.

01:50:02.028 --> 01:50:03.330
I MEAN LOOK I MEAN I DON'T THINK

01:50:03.396 --> 01:50:06.199
IT'S THE FIRST.

01:50:06.266 --> 01:50:07.200
WHEN A BUILDING AT ALL THEY'RE I

01:50:07.267 --> 01:50:07.801
MEAN THEY'RE THE WE HAVE TO

01:50:07.867 --> 01:50:09.903
REALLY DO AN ASSESSMENT AND A

01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:11.504
GOOD STUDY TO DETERMINE?

01:50:11.571 --> 01:50:12.806
WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT KIND OF

01:50:12.872 --> 01:50:15.041
PROGRAMS COULD BE PUT IN PLACE --

01:50:15.108 --> 01:50:16.543
YOU'LL GET A LOOK AT THAT.

01:50:16.609 --> 01:50:17.978
IT KIND OF FUELS BEDS THAT ARE

01:50:18.044 --> 01:50:19.446
THERE WHAT THE WHAT THE FIRE

01:50:19.512 --> 01:50:20.981
HISTORY IS WHAT ONE OF THE

01:50:21.047 --> 01:50:22.816
PREVAILING WINDS ALL OF THESE

01:50:22.882 --> 01:50:23.950
THINGS ARE FACTORS HOW DO YOU

01:50:24.017 --> 01:50:25.251
WANT TO BUILD STRUCTURE YOU WANT

01:50:25.318 --> 01:50:26.353
TO BUILD THERE WHERE THE

01:50:26.419 --> 01:50:26.987
BUILDING MATERIALS YOU'RE GOING

01:50:27.053 --> 01:50:27.654
TO USE.

01:50:27.721 --> 01:50:28.955
HOW MANY PEOPLE WHAT'S THE EGG

01:50:29.022 --> 01:50:30.890
INGRESS AND EGRESS AND SO

01:50:30.957 --> 01:50:32.258
THERE'S THEIR STUDIES THAT CAN

01:50:32.325 --> 01:50:34.160
BE DONE TO TO LOOK AT ALL OF

01:50:34.227 --> 01:50:35.095
THAT AND AND THEN MAKE A

01:50:35.161 --> 01:50:36.763
RECOMMENDATION AS TO WHETHER OR

01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:38.298
NOT -- IT'S

01:50:38.365 --> 01:50:40.166
A VIABLE TO BUILD IN THAT

01:50:40.233 --> 01:50:41.101
PARTICULAR AREA RIGHT SO WE'RE

01:50:41.167 --> 01:50:42.969
NOT JUST SAYING NO WE'RE SAYING

01:50:43.036 --> 01:50:45.305
CONDITION OLE I MEAN THIS RIGHT

01:50:45.372 --> 01:50:46.239
YOU'VE GOT INTIMATELY THE AND

01:50:46.306 --> 01:50:47.574
YOU MAKE A LOOK WE'VE WE'VE

01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:48.575
LOOKED AT ALL THE MEDICAID OF

01:50:48.641 --> 01:50:51.378
ALL THINGS AND THIS IS STILL.

01:50:51.444 --> 01:50:53.046
A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN.

01:50:53.113 --> 01:50:54.547
WE WE SHOULD JUST NOT GO THERE

01:50:54.614 --> 01:50:56.249
AND SO.

01:50:56.316 --> 01:50:56.883
I WITH THE ONE THING WE DIDN'T

01:50:56.950 --> 01:51:01.588
TOUCH ON AND OF ALL THE SORT OF

01:51:01.654 --> 01:51:02.555
MITIGATION --

01:51:02.622 --> 01:51:03.923
TOOLS WE'VE GOT IS ON THE POWER

01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:05.925
SIDE --

01:51:05.992 --> 01:51:08.595
POWER IS LIFE IN IN THESE

01:51:08.661 --> 01:51:10.263
MOMENTS IS WHAT YOU KNOW KEEP IN

01:51:10.330 --> 01:51:13.533
URGENT CARE CENTER ONLINETO DO

01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:15.668
WITH VICTIMS IT'S HOURS ARE CELL

01:51:15.735 --> 01:51:16.803
INFRASTRUCTURE --

01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:18.171
I HEARD AN IDEA AND I WANT TO

01:51:18.238 --> 01:51:20.373
GET YOUR TAKE ON IT IN TERMS OF

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:22.842
HAVING PROPER BACKUP POWER

01:51:22.909 --> 01:51:25.779
SYSTEMS IN PLACE --

01:51:25.845 --> 01:51:27.247
BOTH FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

01:51:27.313 --> 01:51:29.349
AND POTENTIALLY EVEN GOING ALL

01:51:29.416 --> 01:51:30.183
THE WAY DOWN TO RESIDENTIAL

01:51:30.250 --> 01:51:30.750
SCALE.

01:51:30.817 --> 01:51:32.819
BUT NOT I'M NOT SO MUCH ON THE

01:51:32.886 --> 01:51:36.189
GENERATION SIDE PER SE BUT BUT

01:51:36.256 --> 01:51:37.924
STORAGE OF OF THAT --

01:51:37.991 --> 01:51:38.892
BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY GENERATION

01:51:38.958 --> 01:51:40.360
BUT IF WE HAD BATTERY BACKUP

01:51:40.427 --> 01:51:41.861
POWER FOR INSTANCE FOR ALL

01:51:41.928 --> 01:51:42.929
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

01:51:42.996 --> 01:51:44.998
THROUGHOUT THE HI FI SEVERITIES

01:51:45.065 --> 01:51:46.332
ON THE STATE --

01:51:46.399 --> 01:51:48.334
DO YOU SEE THAT IS A IMPORTANT

01:51:48.401 --> 01:51:50.270
TOOL FOR AT LEAST ON THE THE

01:51:50.336 --> 01:51:51.237
RESPONSE I DON'T KNOW DOESN'T

01:51:51.304 --> 01:51:53.006
ACTUALLY MITIGATE RISK

01:51:53.073 --> 01:51:55.508
NECESSARILY BUT WHAT WOULD IN IN

01:51:55.575 --> 01:51:56.743
ENTERING THESE DISASTERS I MEAN.

01:51:56.810 --> 01:52:00.313
THAT THAT POWER CHALLENGE IN

01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:02.015
REBUILD CAN BE WOULD WE BE

01:52:02.082 --> 01:52:02.615
BENEFITTED FROM.

01:52:02.682 --> 01:52:06.319
SORT OF MORE RESILIENT POWER

01:52:06.386 --> 01:52:08.855
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THOSE AREAS.

01:52:08.922 --> 01:52:10.223
ABSOLUTELY CELL.

01:52:10.290 --> 01:52:12.392
BATTERY BACKUP POWER IS A GREAT

01:52:12.459 --> 01:52:13.493
THING THEY HAVEN'T --

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:14.661
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU KNOW

01:52:14.727 --> 01:52:16.296
SOMETHING WHERE EVERY GAS

01:52:16.362 --> 01:52:18.231
STATION HAS EITHER --

01:52:18.298 --> 01:52:19.766
A SMALL GENERATOR CAPABILITY TO

01:52:19.833 --> 01:52:21.334
KEEP THE POWER RUNNING FOR FUEL

01:52:21.401 --> 01:52:23.069
SO THAT PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED TO

01:52:23.136 --> 01:52:23.803
GET FEEL WHEN THEY NEED IT

01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:25.338
BECAUSE WHEN THE POWER GOES DOWN.

01:52:25.405 --> 01:52:27.373
THE POPS SHUT DOWN AND THEY

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:28.942
BASICALLY GO OF GOLD BOB YOU

01:52:29.008 --> 01:52:29.876
KNOW INERT --

01:52:29.943 --> 01:52:31.511
THAT'S A SMALL THING THAT COULD

01:52:31.578 --> 01:52:34.114
HAVE A HUGE IMPACT --

01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:35.715
WITH THE NOW NEW TECH BATTERY --

01:52:35.782 --> 01:52:37.283
SUSTAINABLE LITHIUM BATTERY

01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:39.052
BACKUP CAPABILITIES THAT COULD

01:52:39.119 --> 01:52:40.787
BE EVEN BATTERY --

01:52:40.854 --> 01:52:43.056
IF FLORIDA BAY MANDATED THAT

01:52:43.123 --> 01:52:44.691
THEY THEY PUT A LONG PLACES SAID

01:52:44.757 --> 01:52:46.226
THAT GET GAS STATIONS NEEDED TO

01:52:46.292 --> 01:52:47.293
HAVE A GENERATOR POWER TO RUN

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:49.395
THEIR GAS IS BECAUSE IN FLORIDA.

01:52:49.462 --> 01:52:50.230
WHEN THEY HAVE A HURRICANE

01:52:50.296 --> 01:52:51.965
COMING IN THEY HAVE TO MOVE

01:52:52.031 --> 01:52:53.199
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE?

01:52:53.266 --> 01:52:54.067
THEY WERE HAVING GAS STATIONS

01:52:54.134 --> 01:52:55.201
THAT WOULD YOU YOU KNOW BECAUSE

01:52:55.268 --> 01:52:56.469
THE POWERS GOING OUT THEY JUST

01:52:56.536 --> 01:52:58.037
THEY THEY THEY COULDN'T DO IT SO.

01:52:58.104 --> 01:53:01.274
THEY REALLY LOOK AT LOOK AT THAT

01:53:01.341 --> 01:53:03.376
AND I THINK THAT THERE'S AS OF

01:53:03.443 --> 01:53:04.777
THINGS THAT -

01:53:04.844 --> 01:53:06.212
THAT YOU COULD LOOK AT TO BE

01:53:06.279 --> 01:53:07.580
ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT AND AND YOU

01:53:07.647 --> 01:53:10.884
KNOW CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND

01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:12.752
CRITICAL MEDICAL --

01:53:12.819 --> 01:53:15.989
SENIOR CARE FACILITIES ARE BIG.

01:53:16.055 --> 01:53:17.323
ONE SPEAKER CARE FACILITIES

01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:19.325
GENERALLY OR DO NOT HAVE THE THE

01:53:19.392 --> 01:53:20.593
THE BACKUP POWER --

01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:22.428
IN PLACE AND WHEN WE HAVE

01:53:22.495 --> 01:53:23.863
SOMETHING YOU KNOW WHAT WE LOSE

01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:25.398
THE POWER THERE ARE THE IT'S A

01:53:25.465 --> 01:53:26.432
HUGE.

01:53:26.499 --> 01:53:28.668
PRIORITY FOR US TO GET ANALYST

01:53:28.735 --> 01:53:30.236
TEAMS TO THESE FACILITIES IN AS

01:53:30.303 --> 01:53:32.205
MANY OF THEM AND AS THAT OUR

01:53:32.272 --> 01:53:33.640
SOCIETY AGES GREATLY.

01:53:33.706 --> 01:53:35.308
THERE ARE INCREASING IN NUMBER

01:53:35.375 --> 01:53:36.709
AND SO IT'S IT'S THAT'S

01:53:36.776 --> 01:53:37.544
SOMETHING THAT WE WE

01:53:37.610 --> 01:53:39.045
COLLECTIVELY NEED TO FOCUS ON

01:53:39.112 --> 01:53:41.247
AND AND SO ANY OF THOSE KINDS OF

01:53:41.314 --> 01:53:42.815
MEDICAL HEALTH THINGS SHOULD

01:53:42.882 --> 01:53:43.316
HAVE.

01:53:43.383 --> 01:53:44.884
BACK UP AND WHAT THAT DOES IS

01:53:44.951 --> 01:53:46.319
THAT MITIGATES --

01:53:46.386 --> 01:53:48.555
THE IMPACTS AND QUITE FRANKLY IN

01:53:48.621 --> 01:53:49.889
IN MANY CASES THAT COULD BE A

01:53:49.956 --> 01:53:51.357
MEDIC THAT COULD BE A PROJECT

01:53:51.424 --> 01:53:52.825
THAT COULD BE FUNDED THROUGH THE

01:53:52.892 --> 01:53:54.460
MEDICATION PROGRAM SO THE COULD

01:53:54.527 --> 01:53:56.029
BE FUNDS TO HELP GET THEIR WE

01:53:56.095 --> 01:53:57.130
WOULD LOVE YOUR HELP GOING

01:53:57.197 --> 01:53:59.566
FORWARD ON THAT LIST.

01:53:59.632 --> 01:54:00.533
RIGHT HOW TO ACTUALLY AND IF

01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:01.901
THAT TAKES GETTING BETTER LOCAL

01:54:01.968 --> 01:54:04.704
DATA UP TO THE STATE LEVEL WE'RE

01:54:04.771 --> 01:54:07.607
WILLING TO GO THERE --

01:54:07.674 --> 01:54:10.043
MORE I I PERSONALLY AM BUT IS

01:54:10.109 --> 01:54:11.077
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T EVEN

01:54:11.144 --> 01:54:11.945
KNOW WHERE SOME OF THE SENIOR

01:54:12.011 --> 01:54:13.279
CARE FACILITIES ARE FOR INSTANCE

01:54:13.346 --> 01:54:14.447
AND MANY OF THESE JURISDICTION

01:54:14.514 --> 01:54:16.149
SO WE COME IN WE HAVE A DISASTER

01:54:16.216 --> 01:54:17.417
AND LIKE WHERE DO WE GO.

01:54:17.483 --> 01:54:18.718
WE DON'T KNOW RIGHT SO I I'VE

01:54:18.785 --> 01:54:20.320
HEARD THAT FROM LOCAL FIRE ON

01:54:20.386 --> 01:54:22.555
NUEROUS OCCASIONS --

01:54:22.622 --> 01:54:24.724
HOW TO GET THAT DATA SAID RIGHT --

01:54:24.791 --> 01:54:26.893
SOMETHING WITH HOPEFULLY WORK ON

01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:29.562
GOING FORWARD THANKS AGAIN.

WITH THE CITY OF VENTURA.

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:41.834

01:55:47.173 --> 01:55:48.207
IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY.

01:55:48.274 --> 01:55:50.009
IT DIDN'T LAST IN THAT CATEGORY

01:55:50.076 --> 01:55:51.277
VERY LONG BECAUSE WE'VE HAD A

01:55:51.344 --> 01:55:54.047
LONG HISTORY OF FIRES SINCE THEN --

01:55:54.113 --> 01:55:55.114
JUST THE BASIC FACTS OF OUR

01:55:55.181 --> 01:55:56.516
EXPERIENCE AND ENSURE WE LOST

01:55:56.582 --> 01:55:57.984
FIVE ENGINE TWENTY FOUR SINGLE

01:55:58.051 --> 01:55:59.519
FAMILY HOMES ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:55:59.585 --> 01:56:01.954
MULTI FAMILY UNITS INCLUDING A

01:56:02.021 --> 01:56:03.756
MENTAL HEALTH A MENTAL HOSPITAL.

01:56:03.823 --> 01:56:05.425
IN OUR COMMUNITY --

01:56:05.491 --> 01:56:07.360
I WANT TO FIRST ALSO THANK THE

01:56:07.427 --> 01:56:08.695
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAD A

01:56:08.761 --> 01:56:10.229
TERRIFIC EXPERIENCE IN OUR

01:56:10.296 --> 01:56:11.764
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE --

01:56:11.831 --> 01:56:13.966
BOTH CAL RECYCLE OUR CALVET

01:56:14.033 --> 01:56:15.368
CAUGHT FIRE AND CAL WE **** WERE

01:56:15.435 --> 01:56:17.370
ALL IMPORTANT PARTNERS IN OUR

01:56:17.437 --> 01:56:18.438
SUCCESS --

01:56:18.504 --> 01:56:22.008
AND I KNOW SENATOR JACKSON LEFT

01:56:22.075 --> 01:56:25.645
BUT I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT OUR

01:56:25.712 --> 01:56:26.546
RECOVERY --

01:56:26.612 --> 01:56:28.247
AND I I THINK THE FIRST POINT

01:56:28.314 --> 01:56:30.049
I'D LIKE TO MAKE TO THE PANEL

01:56:30.116 --> 01:56:32.118
TODAY IS ONE OF THE ONE OF THE

01:56:32.185 --> 01:56:33.286
AHA MOMENTS FOR ME IN THE

01:56:33.353 --> 01:56:34.754
RECOVERY SINCE I WAS IN CHARGE

01:56:34.821 --> 01:56:36.022
OF RECOVERY NOT THE FIRE

01:56:36.089 --> 01:56:37.323
FIGHTING PART OF IT --

01:56:37.390 --> 01:56:39.058
AS A COMMITTED ON THE DIRECTOR

01:56:39.125 --> 01:56:40.893
AND THE CITY OF AN A A IS WE

01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:42.095
STARTED WITH THE WITH THE

01:56:42.161 --> 01:56:43.162
RECOVERY ON DAY.

01:56:43.229 --> 01:56:44.731
ONE WE WERE REALLY IN THE FIELD

01:56:44.797 --> 01:56:46.232
LOOKING AT THE EXTENT OF THE OF

01:56:46.299 --> 01:56:47.467
THE DAMAGE AND WHAT WE HAVE

01:56:47.533 --> 01:56:48.768
AHEAD OF US FOR THE RESULT

01:56:48.835 --> 01:56:49.969
PROCESS ON DAY.

01:56:50.036 --> 01:56:51.504
ONE AND THE KEY THE CALIFORNIA

01:56:51.571 --> 01:56:52.839
SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLE AND

01:56:52.905 --> 01:56:54.874
IMPRESSIVE WE HAD EIGHT THOUSAND

01:56:54.941 --> 01:56:56.542
FIREFIGHTERS IN OUR COMMUNITY --

01:56:56.609 --> 01:56:58.311
BUT I'M NOT SURE THE SYSTEM IS

01:56:58.378 --> 01:57:00.146
SET UP TO HELP CITIES FIGURE OUT

01:57:00.213 --> 01:57:02.448
HOW TO RECOVER SO ONE OF THE

01:57:02.515 --> 01:57:03.516
THOUGHTS I HAD IS IT IF IF THAT

01:57:03.583 --> 01:57:04.784
GOT THAT WHOLE COMMAND CENTER.

01:57:04.851 --> 01:57:07.420
CENTER WHICH IS AS YOU ALL UP TO

01:57:07.487 --> 01:57:08.755
TRIXIE IS IMPRESSIVE.

01:57:08.821 --> 01:57:10.423
HAVING A BETTER SENSE OF HOW TO

01:57:10.490 --> 01:57:12.191
HELP CITIES HAVE IT TO RECOVERY

01:57:12.258 --> 01:57:13.993
ACT ON DAY ONE BECAUSE WE HAD TO

01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:14.627
DO THAT.

01:57:14.694 --> 01:57:15.995
OUR COMMUNITY EXPECTED TO

01:57:16.062 --> 01:57:17.597
RECOVER AND REBUILD --

01:57:17.663 --> 01:57:18.564
AND THEY WERE ASKING US THOSE

01:57:18.631 --> 01:57:20.466
QUESTIONS IMMEDIATELY AND WE

01:57:20.533 --> 01:57:22.402
DIDN'T HAVE A REAL PLAN AHEAD OF

01:57:22.468 --> 01:57:23.870
US WE GOT THERE.

01:57:23.936 --> 01:57:26.873
ARE THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIPS BUT

01:57:26.939 --> 01:57:30.009
IT WASN'T ALWAYS I I ALSO WILL

01:57:30.076 --> 01:57:31.611
SAY THAT WE ARE WE DID NEVER

01:57:31.677 --> 01:57:33.079
QUESTION THE IDEA OF REBUILDING

01:57:33.146 --> 01:57:34.113
IN OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE WERE

01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:35.281
SET UP WITH.

01:57:35.348 --> 01:57:36.449
BOUNDARIES --

01:57:36.516 --> 01:57:38.117
WHERE ARE DEVELOPMENT LIMITS

01:57:38.184 --> 01:57:39.051
WERE BASED ON OUR --

01:57:39.118 --> 01:57:40.453
PROTECTION AGRICULTURE AN OPEN

01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:42.588
SPACE SO THE IDEA OF REBUILDING

01:57:42.655 --> 01:57:44.023
WAS AN OBVIOUS CHOICE FOR US AND

01:57:44.090 --> 01:57:45.191
WE DIDN'T SECOND GUESS THAT

01:57:45.258 --> 01:57:46.526
PROCESS --

01:57:46.592 --> 01:57:47.994
SO WE HAD TO GET THERE PRETTY

01:57:48.060 --> 01:57:49.862
QUICKLY A AND SO THAT US SOME

01:57:49.929 --> 01:57:51.097
HELP THROUGH THE COMMAND CENTER

01:57:51.164 --> 01:57:52.799
HOW CITIES CAN MAKE THAT

01:57:52.865 --> 01:57:54.801
TRANSITION TO RECOVER WOULD BE.

01:57:54.867 --> 01:57:55.468
REALLY HELPFUL FROM OUR

01:57:55.535 --> 01:57:56.569
PERSPECTIVE.

01:57:56.636 --> 01:57:57.670
I THINK THE MANY THE COMMITTEE

01:57:57.737 --> 01:57:58.838
MEMBERS OF ASKING THIS QUESTION

01:57:58.905 --> 01:58:00.273
AND DEBT I THINK THE OTHER PART

01:58:00.339 --> 01:58:02.108
MOVING FORWARD TOWARDS.

01:58:02.175 --> 01:58:03.443
PROTECTING OUR NEIGHBORHOODS IS

01:58:03.509 --> 01:58:05.178
WE HAVE TO TALK A LOT ABOUT HOW

01:58:05.244 --> 01:58:06.746
TO PROTECT OUR EXISTING HOMES

01:58:06.813 --> 01:58:07.680
BEFORE THE FIRE.

01:58:07.747 --> 01:58:11.017
ON AND I THINK YOU'VE TALKED A

01:58:11.083 --> 01:58:12.285
LOT ABOUT THAT AND I DON'T NEED.

01:58:12.351 --> 01:58:12.919
TO EMPHASIZE IT TOO MUCH THEY

01:58:12.985 --> 01:58:14.020
THINK YOU'RE HEADING IN THAT

01:58:14.086 --> 01:58:15.054
DIRECTION BUT HOW DO WE MAKE

01:58:15.121 --> 01:58:16.522
SURE THAT HOMES --

01:58:16.589 --> 01:58:18.424
THAT ARE EXISTING BEFORE I FIRE

01:58:18.491 --> 01:58:20.026
ARE BETTER THAT'S PROTECTED ONE

01:58:20.092 --> 01:58:21.627
OF THOSE WAYS IS TO MAKE SURE

01:58:21.694 --> 01:58:23.463
THAT WERE WE HAVE MORE MORE

01:58:23.529 --> 01:58:25.364
ROBUST DEBRIS I SEE MOBILE MORE

01:58:25.431 --> 01:58:26.766
ROBUST --

01:58:26.833 --> 01:58:28.768
REMOVAL OF VEGETATION AROUND

01:58:28.835 --> 01:58:30.269
HOME SYSTEM.

01:58:30.336 --> 01:58:31.604
IN OUR PARTICULAR CASE WE HAD

01:58:31.671 --> 01:58:33.306
WERE VERY GOOD ABOUT THE HOMES

01:58:33.372 --> 01:58:34.774
AT THE EDGE OF THE FIRES ON SO

01:58:34.841 --> 01:58:35.842
IN OUR IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS

01:58:35.908 --> 01:58:37.009
THOSE HOMES AROUND THE EDGES

01:58:37.076 --> 01:58:39.245
WERE VERY MUCH PUSH TO DO THAT

01:58:39.312 --> 01:58:40.646
THAT CLEARANCE EVERY YEAR.

01:58:40.713 --> 01:58:42.415
WE DIDN'T DO SO MUCH OF THE

01:58:42.482 --> 01:58:44.884
HOMES IN THE MIDDLE OF HEY SOME

01:58:44.951 --> 01:58:45.952
OF THE HOMES AT THE EDGES DID

01:58:46.018 --> 01:58:47.220
BETTER THAN THOSE IN THE MIDDLE

01:58:47.286 --> 01:58:48.020
OF THE COMMUNITY.

01:58:48.087 --> 01:58:49.255
BECAUSE WE WERE FACED WITH THE

01:58:49.322 --> 01:58:52.024
HUGE AND VERY FAST FIRE --

01:58:52.091 --> 01:58:53.659
AND THE FLAMES ACTUALLY JUMPED

01:58:53.726 --> 01:58:54.594
THE EDGE AND WENT INTO THE

01:58:54.660 --> 01:58:55.928
COMMUNITIES IN THE MIDDLE AND

01:58:55.995 --> 01:58:56.796
THOSE HOMES IN THE MIDDLE OF

01:58:56.863 --> 01:58:58.431
THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS WERE NOT

01:58:58.498 --> 01:58:59.031
PROTECTED BECAUSE WE DID NOT

01:58:59.098 --> 01:58:59.832
PUSH.

01:58:59.899 --> 01:59:01.434
A ROBUST WAY THAT THEY DO THAT

01:59:01.501 --> 01:59:03.202
CLEARANCE SO I THINK ANYTHING

01:59:03.269 --> 01:59:05.404
THE STATE CAN DO TO HELP

01:59:05.471 --> 01:59:07.039
ENCOURAGE MANDATE --

01:59:07.106 --> 01:59:08.174
OR PROVIDE THE RESOURCES THAT

01:59:08.241 --> 01:59:09.909
CITIES CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF

01:59:09.976 --> 01:59:10.943
MAKING SURE THAT HOMES ARE

01:59:11.010 --> 01:59:13.779
PROTECTED IN ADVANCE OF A FIRE --

01:59:13.846 --> 01:59:14.580
WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL I I THINK

01:59:14.647 --> 01:59:15.982
THE OTHER THING AND WE TALKED A

01:59:16.048 --> 01:59:17.450
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT TOO IS HOW

01:59:17.517 --> 01:59:19.418
DO WE RETROFIT HOMES IN ADVANCE

01:59:19.485 --> 01:59:20.353
OF A FIRE --

01:59:20.419 --> 01:59:21.954
THE BUILDING CODES ARE IN THE

01:59:22.021 --> 01:59:23.055
PROCESS BEING UPDATED TO BE

01:59:23.122 --> 01:59:25.758
EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY.

01:59:25.825 --> 01:59:26.592
TWENTY TWENTY EVERY TIME WE'D UP

01:59:26.659 --> 01:59:27.994
CODES WE LEARN FROM OUR

01:59:28.060 --> 01:59:28.728
EXPERIENCE --

01:59:28.794 --> 01:59:30.530
WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO LEARN

01:59:30.596 --> 01:59:31.731
FROM OUR EXPERIENCE FROM FIRES

01:59:31.797 --> 01:59:33.165
WHAT ADDITIONAL.

01:59:33.232 --> 01:59:35.301
RESTRICTIONS ON ON BUILDING

01:59:35.368 --> 01:59:36.769
CODES THAT WE CAN PUT IN PLACE.

01:59:36.836 --> 01:59:37.270
TO MAKE SURE THAT NEW

01:59:37.336 --> 01:59:38.771
DEVELOPMENT MEETS THOSE HIGHER

01:59:38.838 --> 01:59:40.540
STANDARDS OF BEING MORE

01:59:40.606 --> 01:59:42.074
PROTECTED MORE FIRE RESISTANT IN

01:59:42.141 --> 01:59:43.242
THEIR CONSTRUCTION.

01:59:43.309 --> 01:59:44.277
BUT I THINK THE SECOND PART OF

01:59:44.343 --> 01:59:45.678
THAT IS HOW DO WE GO BACK TO

01:59:45.745 --> 01:59:46.979
RETROFIT EXISTING HOMES YOU ALL

01:59:47.046 --> 01:59:48.314
MENTIONED THAT A LOT ALREADY

01:59:48.381 --> 01:59:49.148
THIS MORNING.

01:59:49.215 --> 01:59:50.483
I THINK THE MORE THE STATE CAN

01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:52.685
DO TO PROVIDE THE REQUIREMENTS --

01:59:52.752 --> 01:59:55.521
IN THE CODE THAT THAT WOULD PUSH

01:59:55.588 --> 01:59:56.656
THOSE -- BUT

01:59:56.722 --> 01:59:58.291
ALSO --

01:59:58.357 --> 02:00:00.059
INCENTIVES TO HELP YOU DO WITH

02:00:00.126 --> 02:00:04.397
THE THE SEISMIC SYSTEM FOR

02:00:04.463 --> 02:00:05.398
FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO HELP

02:00:05.464 --> 02:00:06.866
HOMEOWNERS UNDERSTAND HOW THEY

02:00:06.933 --> 02:00:07.400
CAN MAKE THEIR HOMES MORE

02:00:07.466 --> 02:00:08.568
RESISTANT.

02:00:08.634 --> 02:00:09.902
ON BEFORE FIRE IT WILL STILL

02:00:09.969 --> 02:00:11.904
SAVE THEM AND ALL OF US IN OUR

02:00:11.971 --> 02:00:13.205
RESPONSE THE FIRES OF THOSE

02:00:13.272 --> 02:00:14.140
THINGS HAPPENED I THINK THAT

02:00:14.206 --> 02:00:15.675
WOULD BE A VALUABLE.

02:00:15.741 --> 02:00:17.243
EXPERIENCE I WILL NOTE ON A SIDE

02:00:17.310 --> 02:00:18.277
NOTE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:00:18.344 --> 02:00:19.712
KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT --

02:00:19.779 --> 02:00:21.113
POST FIRE IS --

02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:22.682
WE LOST FIVE AND TWENTY FOUR

02:00:22.748 --> 02:00:23.883
POOR HOMES WE WOULD NOW WE

02:00:23.950 --> 02:00:25.985
SHOULD PERMITS FOR OVER THREE

02:00:26.052 --> 02:00:26.619
HUNDRED OF THOSE HOMES TO START

02:00:26.686 --> 02:00:27.353
CONSTRUCTION.

02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:28.387
THOSE HOMES WILL MEET ALL

02:00:28.454 --> 02:00:29.188
CURRENT BUILDING CODE

02:00:29.255 --> 02:00:31.657
REQUIREMENTS RIGHT TO THE HOMES

02:00:31.724 --> 02:00:33.025
THAT SURVIVED THE FIRE.

02:00:33.092 --> 02:00:34.360
WERE BUILT IN THE EIGHTIES WHEN

02:00:34.427 --> 02:00:35.928
WE HAD THE SEISMIC EVENT THEY

02:00:35.995 --> 02:00:37.129
WILL NOT SURVIVE SO THE THE

02:00:37.196 --> 02:00:38.598
PEOPLE THAT GOT THROUGH THE

02:00:38.664 --> 02:00:39.966
THOMAS FIRE WILL NOT GET THROUGH

02:00:40.032 --> 02:00:41.300
THE NEXT EVENT SO HOW CAN WE DO

02:00:41.367 --> 02:00:42.468
MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

02:00:42.535 --> 02:00:43.669
HOMES THAT ARE EXISTING.

02:00:43.736 --> 02:00:45.204
WHETHER IT'S SEISMIC OR FIRE

02:00:45.271 --> 02:00:47.506
AREAS ARE ARE ARE TAKEN CARE OF

02:00:47.573 --> 02:00:48.641
IN ADVANCE.

02:00:48.708 --> 02:00:49.942
I THINK THE OTHER PART IS IS

02:00:50.009 --> 02:00:51.377
FRANKLY CONTINUING TO PUSH

02:00:51.444 --> 02:00:53.346
CITIES TO BUILD INFILL

02:00:53.412 --> 02:00:53.913
DEVELOPMENT THAT'S WHERE THE

02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:55.381
DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE --

02:00:55.448 --> 02:00:57.116
AND I I CAN SAY THIS BECAUSE I'M

02:00:57.183 --> 02:00:58.517
NOT REPRESENTING THE CITY I WORK

02:00:58.584 --> 02:00:59.885
FOR DURING THE FIRE --

02:00:59.952 --> 02:01:04.957
AND I WORK FOR CITY NOW IT

02:01:05.024 --> 02:01:06.826
DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A FIRE --

02:01:06.892 --> 02:01:08.794
LIKE THE VENTURE DID BUT YOU

02:01:08.861 --> 02:01:10.129
KNOW AND ENSURE IT DOES DO

02:01:10.196 --> 02:01:11.364
INFILL IT'S OUR IT REALLY IS A

02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:11.964
CORNERSTONE OF OUR LAND USE

02:01:12.031 --> 02:01:12.598
POLICY BUT REALLY PUSHING MORE

02:01:12.665 --> 02:01:14.700
CITIES TO DO INFILL DEVELOPMENT --

02:01:14.767 --> 02:01:16.636
AND AND KEEPING THAT EDGE ARE

02:01:16.702 --> 02:01:17.703
PROTECTED FROM DEVELOPMENT SO

02:01:17.770 --> 02:01:18.838
THAT WE'RE NOT PUTTING MORE

02:01:18.904 --> 02:01:20.706
HOMES AND MORE PEOPLE AT RISK I

02:01:20.773 --> 02:01:22.208
THINK THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT --

02:01:22.274 --> 02:01:25.211
EFFORT FROM THE STATE TO HELPCITIES DO THAT --

02:01:25.277 --> 02:01:26.245
I THINK THE MORE THAT YOU CAN DO

02:01:26.312 --> 02:01:28.447
TO HELP AND ENCOURAGE CITIES TO

02:01:28.514 --> 02:01:29.882
EVALUATE THE CLIMATE CHANGE

02:01:29.949 --> 02:01:32.518
IMPACTS OF THEIR RISK POLICIES

02:01:32.585 --> 02:01:33.386
INCORPORATING THE RESULTS OF

02:01:33.452 --> 02:01:34.053
THAT.

02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:35.054
AND THE STATE I THINK CAN

02:01:35.121 --> 02:01:36.789
PROVIDE THE SORT OF DATABASE AND

02:01:36.856 --> 02:01:38.124
MAKE SURE IT'S A DATA DRIVEN

02:01:38.190 --> 02:01:40.059
POLICY DECISION AND THAT DATA

02:01:40.126 --> 02:01:41.193
CAN COME FROM THE STATE TO HELP

02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:44.897
CITIES BECAUSE WE'RE ALL

02:01:44.964 --> 02:01:47.466
STRETCHED TO DO EVERYTHING THAT.

02:01:47.533 --> 02:01:48.501
I THE MORE THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE

02:01:48.567 --> 02:01:50.302
US THE DATA IN ADVANCE SO THAT

02:01:50.369 --> 02:01:51.604
WE UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THAT

02:01:51.671 --> 02:01:52.938
DATA TO DRIVE POLICY AT THE

02:01:53.005 --> 02:01:54.373
LOCAL LEVEL WILL BE IN A BETTER

02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:55.074
POSITION.

02:01:55.141 --> 02:01:56.208
AND THAT DATA WILL ACTUALLY

02:01:56.275 --> 02:01:57.943
PROVIDE BETTER RESULTS FOR US --

02:01:58.010 --> 02:01:59.612
GOING FORWARD.

02:01:59.679 --> 02:02:00.746
AND I I LOOK THE LAST THING I'LL

02:02:00.813 --> 02:02:01.881
MENTION BECAUSE I WANT I WANT TO

02:02:01.947 --> 02:02:03.282
MAKE SURE WE CAN MOVE ON TO YOUR

02:02:03.349 --> 02:02:04.984
OTHER SPEAKERS IS. ONE OF THE

02:02:05.051 --> 02:02:05.584
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE AND

02:02:05.651 --> 02:02:07.119
AND PRACTICALLY FOUND IN OUR

02:02:07.186 --> 02:02:09.155
EXPERIENCE AND AND RECOVERING

02:02:09.221 --> 02:02:10.656
AND REBUILDING FROM THE FIRE IS.

02:02:10.723 --> 02:02:11.957
THE SORT OF A BUILT IN --

02:02:12.024 --> 02:02:13.292
CONFLICT BETWEEN THE THE THE

02:02:13.359 --> 02:02:15.828
DESIRE FOR DISPENSABLE SPACE.

02:02:15.895 --> 02:02:17.697
AND THE DESIRE FOR A LANDSCAPING

02:02:17.763 --> 02:02:18.497
PLAN IN THEM THE MODEL

02:02:18.564 --> 02:02:20.366
LANDSCAPING PLAN ORDINANCE AT

02:02:20.433 --> 02:02:21.734
THE STATE DR --

02:02:21.801 --> 02:02:22.635
INTO SOMETIMES --

02:02:22.702 --> 02:02:24.103
SINCE COMPLECTED AND WE FOUND

02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:25.504
PEOPLE REALLY STRUGGLE WITH HOW

02:02:25.571 --> 02:02:26.806
DO I COMPLY WITH THIS MODEL

02:02:26.872 --> 02:02:28.107
LANDSCAPE ORDINANCE THE STATE

02:02:28.174 --> 02:02:29.675
MADECITY ADOPT.

02:02:29.742 --> 02:02:31.010
AND ALSO THE DEFENSE OF SPACE

02:02:31.077 --> 02:02:32.578
THAT ARE FAR DEPARTMENT ASKED

02:02:32.645 --> 02:02:33.646
THEM TO DO OR DEMANDED AND TO DO

02:02:33.713 --> 02:02:35.314
ITS PART OF REBUILDING SO I

02:02:35.381 --> 02:02:36.882
THINK MAKING SURE THAT THE CITY.

02:02:36.949 --> 02:02:40.219
HAS UNDERSTANDS HOW THOSE

02:02:40.286 --> 02:02:43.622
POLICIES A CONFLICT HOW DO WE

02:02:43.689 --> 02:02:45.191
DEAL WITH THOSE CONFLICTS I'LL

02:02:45.257 --> 02:02:46.692
LEAVE IT AT THAT THIS MORNING

02:02:46.759 --> 02:02:47.226
AND BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

02:02:47.293 --> 02:02:49.228
QUESTIONS.

02:02:49.295 --> 02:02:50.696
VERY GOOD THANK YOU MISTER

02:02:50.763 --> 02:02:51.597
LAMBERT [inaudible]

02:02:51.664 --> 02:02:53.899
CHIEF JARGON.

02:02:53.966 --> 02:02:56.402
SWITCH OVER DR MORITZ.

02:02:56.469 --> 02:02:57.570
WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN HERE THANKS

02:02:57.636 --> 02:02:58.671
TOM?

02:02:58.738 --> 02:03:00.840
YEAH I APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING YOU

02:03:00.906 --> 02:03:02.274
GUYS STARE AT A PICTURE OF ME

02:03:02.341 --> 02:03:03.275
FOR THIS WHOLE TIME SHOULD IN

02:03:03.342 --> 02:03:04.944
SOME FLAMES OR SOMETHING MORE

02:03:05.010 --> 02:03:06.679
INTERESTING --

02:03:06.746 --> 02:03:07.680
I'VE BEEN --

02:03:07.747 --> 02:03:08.981
STATEWIDE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION

02:03:09.048 --> 02:03:10.583
SPECIALIST IN FIRE FOR FIFTEEN

02:03:10.649 --> 02:03:13.152
YEARS -- AND

02:03:13.219 --> 02:03:14.120
DURING THAT TIME I HAVE

02:03:14.186 --> 02:03:15.287
DEVELOPED A RESEARCH PROGRAM ON

02:03:15.354 --> 02:03:17.123
HAZARD MAPPING EXTREME WIND

02:03:17.189 --> 02:03:18.324
EVENTS THAT BECAUSE MOST OF OUR

02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:19.425
LOSSES.

02:03:19.492 --> 02:03:21.260
CLIMATE CHANGE MODELING AND MORE

02:03:21.327 --> 02:03:23.629
RECENTLY ON LAND DEVELOPMENT

02:03:23.696 --> 02:03:24.864
PATTERNS AND HOW THAT.

02:03:24.930 --> 02:03:26.766
PLAYS A ROLE.

02:03:26.832 --> 02:03:28.067
AND I MIGHT THROUGH MAKE SENSE

02:03:28.134 --> 02:03:29.268
PROGRAM A TRY.

02:03:29.335 --> 02:03:30.169
TO TRANSLATE THAT FOR DECISION

02:03:30.236 --> 02:03:32.138
MAKING.

02:03:32.204 --> 02:03:33.506
I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

02:03:33.572 --> 02:03:35.174
AND IT'S COME UP ALREADY TO TO

02:03:35.241 --> 02:03:36.108
SORT OF DISTINGUISH BETWEEN

02:03:36.175 --> 02:03:37.176
WHICH PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO

02:03:37.243 --> 02:03:39.245
SOLVE HERE I THINK IT'S IT'S

02:03:39.311 --> 02:03:41.614
GOOD WHAT I'VE HEARD SO FAR --

02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:42.882
WE WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE

02:03:42.948 --> 02:03:44.717
DO HAVE A WILDLAND FIRE PROBLEM

02:03:44.784 --> 02:03:46.218
OUT THERE RIGHT.

02:03:46.285 --> 02:03:47.720
THERE ARE FORCED LOS CLIMATE

02:03:47.787 --> 02:03:50.089
CHANGE BARK BEETLE KILL DROUGHT.

02:03:50.156 --> 02:03:51.557
THAT WILDLAND FIRE PROBLEM IS

02:03:51.624 --> 02:03:53.592
DAUNTING AND IT HAS A LOT OF

02:03:53.659 --> 02:03:55.928
LAND MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS.

02:03:55.995 --> 02:03:57.496
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE SEPARATE

02:03:57.563 --> 02:03:59.532
FROM WHAT I WOULD CALL OUR HOME

02:03:59.598 --> 02:04:01.467
LOS PROBLEM OUR HOME LIFE LAST

02:04:01.534 --> 02:04:03.135
PROBLEMS --

02:04:03.202 --> 02:04:05.304
THIS IS ONE OF OF WHERE AND HOW

02:04:05.371 --> 02:04:06.839
WE BUILD IT'S ONE OF HOW WE GET

02:04:06.906 --> 02:04:08.307
PEOPLE OUT OF THESE PLACES WHEN

02:04:08.374 --> 02:04:09.575
THERE ARE FIRES.

02:04:09.642 --> 02:04:11.443
AND THIS ISN'T A WILDLAND FIRE

02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:12.812
PROBLEM THIS IS A WILD AND URBAN

02:04:12.878 --> 02:04:15.181
INTERFACE PROBLEM RIGHT SO THESE

02:04:15.247 --> 02:04:15.781
ARE REALLY DIFFERENT PROBLEMS

02:04:15.848 --> 02:04:16.782
AND I THINK THAT.

02:04:16.849 --> 02:04:17.783
TALKING ABOUT THEM AS SEPARATE

02:04:17.850 --> 02:04:20.419
PROBLEMS THIS.

02:04:20.486 --> 02:04:22.454
IS IMPORTANT SO I'M I'M

02:04:22.521 --> 02:04:23.055
ENCOURAGED BY WHAT I'M HEARING

02:04:23.122 --> 02:04:24.890
TODAY.

02:04:24.957 --> 02:04:25.925
THERE ARE THAT MANY HOMELESS

02:04:25.991 --> 02:04:27.693
STUDIES SURPRISINGLY I'VE BEEN

02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:29.461
INVOLVED IN A COUPLE SOME FROM

02:04:29.528 --> 02:04:31.263
AUSTRALIAN SOME FROM CALIFORNIA.

02:04:31.330 --> 02:04:33.132
THIS IS ONE THAT'S GOING TO THE

02:04:33.199 --> 02:04:34.233
FINAL STAGES OF PEER REVIEW.

02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:35.134
I'M LOOKING AT THREE DIFFERENT

02:04:35.201 --> 02:04:36.602
PARTS OF CALIFORNIA OVER FIFTEEN

02:04:36.669 --> 02:04:40.172
YEARS -- AND

02:04:40.239 --> 02:04:41.807
ALSO LOOKING AT THE LAST FEW

02:04:41.874 --> 02:04:43.809
LARGE FIRE EVENTS THIS GRAPH

02:04:43.876 --> 02:04:45.511
HERE BASICALLY SHOWS --

02:04:45.578 --> 02:04:46.912
HOUSING DENSITIES AND THE RED

02:04:46.979 --> 02:04:50.850
BARS ARE THE NUMBER OF THE

02:04:50.916 --> 02:04:52.718
NUMBER OF HOMES LOST DURING

02:04:52.785 --> 02:04:53.986
FIRES.

02:04:54.053 --> 02:04:56.689
AND THE BLACK BARS ARE OUR HOMES

02:04:56.755 --> 02:04:57.990
THAT WEREN'T BURNED RIGHT AND

02:04:58.057 --> 02:05:00.459
WHAT YOU SEE FROM THESE DATA.

02:05:00.526 --> 02:05:02.795
ARE THAT LOWER HOUSING DENSITIES

02:05:02.862 --> 02:05:04.763
AND THIS HAS BEEN REPEATED OVER

02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:06.165
AND OVER IN IN OTHER STUDIES.

02:05:06.232 --> 02:05:08.868
LOWER HOUSING DENSITIES TEND TO

02:05:08.934 --> 02:05:11.203
BE WHERE WE LOSE MOST HOMES.

02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:12.538
RIGHT AND THAT'S DESPITE.

02:05:12.605 --> 02:05:14.373
EXCUSE ME THAT'S DESPITE SOME OF

02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:14.874
THESE.

02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:16.442
RECENT KIND OF CA AS I URBAN

02:05:16.508 --> 02:05:18.444
FIRES WERE WE LOST A LOT OF

02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:20.913
HOMES. THREE TIME IF YOU LOOK AT

02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:22.748
THE BROADER PATTERNS ACTUALLY

02:05:22.815 --> 02:05:24.817
LOWER DENSITY --

02:05:24.884 --> 02:05:26.385
RURAL AREAS ARE PROBABLY THE

02:05:26.452 --> 02:05:28.187
MOST AT RISK AND THAT THAT'S

02:05:28.254 --> 02:05:29.121
KIND OF AN IMPORTANT.

02:05:29.188 --> 02:05:32.124
IMPORTANT POINT.

02:05:32.191 --> 02:05:33.325
I SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME

02:05:33.392 --> 02:05:35.094
THE LAST TWO YEARS TRYING TO

02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:36.795
UNDERSTAND WHAT GOES INTO URBAN

02:05:36.862 --> 02:05:38.497
PLANNING AND LAND USE PLANNING

02:05:38.564 --> 02:05:40.266
WITH RESPECT TO FIRE.

02:05:40.332 --> 02:05:42.001
AND WHAT'S MISSING.

02:05:42.067 --> 02:05:43.769
AND SO ARE.

02:05:43.836 --> 02:05:45.404
WHAT'S BEEN KIND OF SURPRISING

02:05:45.471 --> 02:05:47.873
TO ME IS TO FIND THAT THERE'S A

02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:49.675
LOT OF GOOD.

02:05:49.742 --> 02:05:51.543
EFFORT AN EMPHASIS ON THIS ON

02:05:51.610 --> 02:05:52.578
THE BUILDING CODES AND THAT THE

02:05:52.645 --> 02:05:54.980
SCALE OF AN INDIVIDUAL STRUCTURE.

02:05:55.047 --> 02:05:57.316
BUT AS YOU ZOOM OUT AND LOOK AT

02:05:57.383 --> 02:05:58.751
WHAT'S ON THE BOOKS.

02:05:58.817 --> 02:06:00.886
FOR A CITING A COMMUNITY OR HOW

02:06:00.953 --> 02:06:02.721
IT'S LAID OUT THERE'S ALMOST

02:06:02.788 --> 02:06:04.623
NOTHING ACTUALLY.

02:06:04.690 --> 02:06:06.358
THERE'S NOTHING CODIFIED ASIDE

02:06:06.425 --> 02:06:08.460
FROM INGRESS AND EGRESS AND A

02:06:08.527 --> 02:06:10.229
LITTLE BIT OF OF OUR WATER

02:06:10.296 --> 02:06:11.263
REQUIREMENTS.

02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:13.198
REGULATIONS THERE'S VERY LITTLE

02:06:13.265 --> 02:06:15.567
AT BROADER SCALES ABOUT HOW WE

02:06:15.634 --> 02:06:17.169
SITE AND LAY OUT A COMMUNITY

02:06:17.236 --> 02:06:19.171
WHICH IS KIND OF SURPRISING --

02:06:19.238 --> 02:06:21.573
AND SO AFTER INTERVIEWING AFTER

02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:23.042
LOOKING THROUGH THE LITERATURE

02:06:23.108 --> 02:06:25.444
INTERVIEWING FIREFIGHTERS THAT

02:06:25.511 --> 02:06:26.779
OF WORKING FIVE MARSHALS OFFICES.

02:06:26.845 --> 02:06:27.780
INTERVENING LAND USE PLANNERS

02:06:27.846 --> 02:06:29.715
HOW THEY'VE INTERACTED WITH

02:06:29.782 --> 02:06:30.349
THEIR FIRE PROFESSIONALS AND HOW

02:06:30.416 --> 02:06:31.984
THE HOW THE PROCESS WORKS

02:06:32.051 --> 02:06:34.887
INTERVIEWING THE CALIFORNIA LAND

02:06:34.954 --> 02:06:38.057
USE PLANNING PROGRAM TEAM --

02:06:38.123 --> 02:06:39.525
I REALIZE THAT THERE ARE A LOT

02:06:39.591 --> 02:06:40.993
OF RISK REDUCTION MEASURES WE

02:06:41.060 --> 02:06:43.929
MIGHT CALL BEST PRACTICES THAT

02:06:43.996 --> 02:06:45.731
ARE ACTUALLY NOT CODIFIED IN THE

02:06:45.798 --> 02:06:47.499
NEED TO BE SO WE NEED STRONGER

02:06:47.566 --> 02:06:49.268
LAWS ON THESE ISSUES.

02:06:49.335 --> 02:06:50.502
THERE'S ANOTHER PIECE OF WORK

02:06:50.569 --> 02:06:51.870
THAT -- I AM

02:06:51.937 --> 02:06:53.973
INVOLVED WITH WITH A A COLLEAGUE

02:06:54.039 --> 02:06:55.107
AT BERKELEY THIS IS --

02:06:55.174 --> 02:06:57.076
EARLY EARLY IN THE PERIOD YOU

02:06:57.142 --> 02:06:58.410
PROCESS BUT WE'VE COME UP WITH

02:06:58.477 --> 02:07:00.579
THE TABLE BASICALLY OF OF THESE

02:07:00.646 --> 02:07:02.081
RISK REDUCTION MEASURES WE DON'T

02:07:02.147 --> 02:07:03.515
HAVE TIME TO GO THROUGH THE MALL

02:07:03.582 --> 02:07:04.783
I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW.

02:07:04.850 --> 02:07:06.285
PLEASE GET IN TOUCH WE ACTUALLY

02:07:06.352 --> 02:07:08.721
HAVE COME UP WITH THE A SERIES

02:07:08.787 --> 02:07:10.122
OF THESE THAT MAKES SENSE.

02:07:10.189 --> 02:07:11.724
SOME OF THEM INVOLVE GETTING

02:07:11.790 --> 02:07:13.192
FIREFIGHTERS OR FIRE

02:07:13.258 --> 02:07:15.461
PROFESSIONALS INVOLVED EARLIER.

02:07:15.527 --> 02:07:16.929
IN THE IN THE STRATEGIC PLANNING

02:07:16.996 --> 02:07:18.330
CONVERSATIONS.

02:07:18.397 --> 02:07:19.331
A LOT OF THEM ARE ABOUT THE

02:07:19.398 --> 02:07:20.699
CITING AND THE LAY OUT OF AN

02:07:20.766 --> 02:07:22.534
ACTUAL.

02:07:22.601 --> 02:07:25.404
A NEIGHBORHOOD OR OR SUBDIVISION --

02:07:25.471 --> 02:07:26.138
REDUNDANCIES.

02:07:26.205 --> 02:07:27.706
REFUGES OF LAST RESORT FOR

02:07:27.773 --> 02:07:28.507
PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO GET OUT

02:07:28.574 --> 02:07:30.275
AND CAN'T --

02:07:30.342 --> 02:07:32.478
WATER SUPPLY REDUNDANCIES AN

02:07:32.544 --> 02:07:34.313
AUGMENTED --

02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:36.248
SPRINKLER REQUIREMENTS.

02:07:36.315 --> 02:07:38.083
AND IGNITION MANAGEMENT

02:07:38.150 --> 02:07:40.419
UNDERGROUND UTILITIES SO ALL

02:07:40.486 --> 02:07:42.154
THESE EXIST --

02:07:42.221 --> 02:07:42.921
IN THE LITERATURE OR IN THE

02:07:42.988 --> 02:07:46.158
MINDS OF OF IMPORTANT PEOPLE

02:07:46.225 --> 02:07:46.925
PLAYING ROLES ON THIS BUT

02:07:46.992 --> 02:07:48.293
THERE'S NO A FORTY THERE'S NO

02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:48.994
REGULATORY --

02:07:49.061 --> 02:07:51.163
REGULATORY AUTHORITY FOR THEM TO

02:07:51.230 --> 02:07:52.798
ACTUALLY REQUIRED THESE SO

02:07:52.865 --> 02:07:54.533
THAT'S WHAT THAT'S ONE OF THE

02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:58.637
THINGS THAT'S NEEDED. FOR SO WE

02:07:58.704 --> 02:07:59.605
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THIS

02:07:59.671 --> 02:08:00.672
LOOKING AT THE THE PROBLEM

02:08:00.739 --> 02:08:02.241
SEPARATELY I EVEN THINK THAT IF

02:08:02.307 --> 02:08:04.276
WE LOOKED AT WILDFIRE AS A

02:08:04.343 --> 02:08:05.744
PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUE.

02:08:05.811 --> 02:08:06.645
INSTEAD OF A LAND MANAGEMENT

02:08:06.712 --> 02:08:07.846
ISSUE WE MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT

02:08:07.913 --> 02:08:09.348
SET OF PLAYERS DIFFERENT SET

02:08:09.415 --> 02:08:12.518
CONVERSATIONS --

02:08:12.584 --> 02:08:14.319
AND HE'S COMMUNITY SCALE RISK

02:08:14.386 --> 02:08:15.487
REDUCTION MEASURES WE CAN EXPAND

02:08:15.554 --> 02:08:16.655
THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND

02:08:16.722 --> 02:08:18.624
RESEARCH CRITERIA THAT'S ONE

02:08:18.690 --> 02:08:20.025
PLACE FOR THESE COULD GO.

02:08:20.092 --> 02:08:21.293
AND THAT GIVES THEM SOME WEIGHT

02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:22.995
THEY GIVE SOME SOME.

02:08:23.062 --> 02:08:24.830
SOME AUTHORITY --

02:08:24.897 --> 02:08:26.965
THE GENERAL PLAN ASSESSMENTS

02:08:27.032 --> 02:08:29.601
THAT THAT CAL FIRE DOES.

02:08:29.668 --> 02:08:31.570
THOSE ARE ALL RECOMMENDATIONS.

02:08:31.637 --> 02:08:32.471
RIGHT.

02:08:32.538 --> 02:08:33.038
THEY GET TO WEIGH IN ON THE

02:08:33.105 --> 02:08:34.773
SAFETY ON THAT THOSE COULD BE

02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:36.341
MORE THAN RECOMMENDATIONS THOSE

02:08:36.408 --> 02:08:38.143
COULD BE MANDATORY.

02:08:38.210 --> 02:08:39.545
RIGHT THAT'S NOT MY I THINK

02:08:39.611 --> 02:08:40.979
SHOULD BE STRONGLY CONSIDERED

02:08:41.046 --> 02:08:42.214
ALSO THE LOCAL FIRE MARSHALS

02:08:42.281 --> 02:08:43.549
THAT ARE WEIGHING IN ON THESE

02:08:43.615 --> 02:08:45.117
DEVELOPMENTS.

02:08:45.184 --> 02:08:47.152
THEY'RE ALL RECOMMENDATIONS.

02:08:47.219 --> 02:08:48.620
TO THE DEVELOPER CAN COME BACK

02:08:48.687 --> 02:08:50.055
AND SAY NO I DON'T WANNA.

02:08:50.122 --> 02:08:50.889
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT I DON'T

02:08:50.956 --> 02:08:52.958
WANNA MAKE THAT PERIMETER ROAD

02:08:53.025 --> 02:08:54.426
LOOK LIKE THIS INSTEAD OF THIS

02:08:54.493 --> 02:08:55.427
SO THERE'S NOTHING REQUIRED

02:08:55.494 --> 02:08:56.795
THERE EITHER SO I THINK THE

02:08:56.862 --> 02:08:58.297
LOCAL FIRE MARSHALS.

02:08:58.363 --> 02:08:59.665
COULD BE GIVEN SOME MORE.

02:08:59.731 --> 02:09:00.732
AUTHORITY AND THAT WOULD BE A

02:09:00.799 --> 02:09:03.502
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

02:09:03.569 --> 02:09:04.937

STARTED TEACHING THIS COURSE

02:11:23.775 --> 02:11:26.478
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO.

02:11:26.545 --> 02:11:28.146
IT HAS NOT LIFTED OFF THE GROUND

EIGHT HOUR TRAINING COURSE IT IS

02:11:58.243 --> 02:12:00.379
MY RECOMMENDATION THAT THE LAND

DOES NOT EXIST YET TODAY

02:12:16.662 --> 02:12:17.863
ALTHOUGH SEVERAL MODELS FOR THAN

02:12:17.929 --> 02:12:19.298
DO EXIST.

02:12:19.364 --> 02:12:20.899
BUT THE REQUIREMENT TO BUILD THE

02:12:20.966 --> 02:12:22.801
REQUIREMENT TO UNDERSTAND THIS

02:12:22.868 --> 02:12:24.536
RATHER THAN TRYING TO HAVE FIRE

02:12:24.603 --> 02:12:25.671
FIGHTERS WEIGH IN ON A

02:12:25.737 --> 02:12:28.106
PROFESSIONAL BODY OF KNOWLEDGE.

02:12:28.173 --> 02:12:29.274
WE NEED TO CREATE A

02:12:29.341 --> 02:12:31.076
CERTIFICATION PROCESS IN

02:12:31.143 --> 02:12:32.544
WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE LAND

02:12:32.611 --> 02:12:34.246
USE PLANNING AND ASK OUR

02:12:34.313 --> 02:12:36.148
PROFESSIONALS TO ATTEND THAT AT

02:12:36.214 --> 02:12:37.883
LEAST ONE TIME IN THEIR CAREERS

02:12:37.949 --> 02:12:38.917
SO THAT THEY'RE BRINGING THEIR

02:12:38.984 --> 02:12:40.652
THEIR EXPERTISE IN LAND USE

02:12:40.719 --> 02:12:42.854
PLANNING. TO THE ISSUE AT HAND

02:12:42.921 --> 02:12:45.290
FOR THIS TYPE OF OF RISK.

02:12:45.357 --> 02:12:47.292
AND ARE AND THAT WOULD BE A

02:12:47.359 --> 02:12:49.361
RELATIVELY LOW COST WAY TO

02:12:49.428 --> 02:12:51.063
IMPLEMENT AND THEN CREATE THE

02:12:51.129 --> 02:12:52.764
ABILITY TO MOVE THAT BODY OF

02:12:52.831 --> 02:12:53.465
KNOWLEDGE ACROSS THE

02:12:53.532 --> 02:12:54.633
PROFESSIONALS THAT WILL CREATE

02:12:54.700 --> 02:12:57.002
CONSISTENCY AND ALL OF THE PLANS.

02:12:57.069 --> 02:12:58.603
AND DEVELOP THE THE CONCEPT THAT

02:12:58.670 --> 02:13:02.007
YOU'RE HEARING.

02:13:02.074 --> 02:13:03.675
THANK YOU MAX I ALSO THEN WANT

02:13:03.742 --> 02:13:04.776
TO TALK ABOUT RISK AND

02:13:04.843 --> 02:13:07.346
MITIGATION ANALYSIS.

02:13:07.412 --> 02:13:08.447
WE ARE EMBARKING ON A

02:13:08.513 --> 02:13:10.415
CONVERSATION OF SHOULD WE BUILD

02:13:10.482 --> 02:13:11.450
IN CERTAIN SECTIONS OF

02:13:11.516 --> 02:13:12.684
CALIFORNIA.

02:13:12.751 --> 02:13:14.152
AND WE ARE STARTING TO Q. THAT

02:13:14.219 --> 02:13:15.654
DECISION UP BEHIND THE FIRE

02:13:15.721 --> 02:13:17.556
HAZARD MAPS.

02:13:17.622 --> 02:13:19.391
EXISTING ONES OR NEW ONES THEY

02:13:19.458 --> 02:13:20.625
TELL US.

02:13:20.692 --> 02:13:22.327
A CERTAIN COMPONENT OF THIS

02:13:22.394 --> 02:13:23.862
QUESTION BUT THEY DO NOT TELL US

02:13:23.929 --> 02:13:25.597
WHAT THE RISK IS THEY WILL TELL

02:13:25.664 --> 02:13:26.732
US WHAT THE HAZARDOUS THE

02:13:26.798 --> 02:13:27.866
PROBABILITY OF THE FIRE

02:13:27.933 --> 02:13:29.868
OCCURRING AND THE RELATIVE

02:13:29.935 --> 02:13:31.570
SEVERITY OF THE FIRE ITSELF.

02:13:31.636 --> 02:13:32.938
BUT THEY DO NOT TELL US WHAT THE

02:13:33.004 --> 02:13:34.506
DAMAGES BECAUSE THEY DO NOT

02:13:34.573 --> 02:13:36.274
MEASURE THE MED MEDICATIONS THAT

02:13:36.341 --> 02:13:37.676
WERE ASKING US TO COMPLETE

02:13:37.743 --> 02:13:39.010
THERE'S NO WAY TO PUT THAT

02:13:39.077 --> 02:13:40.612
TOGETHER IN A SYSTEMATIC MODEL.

02:13:40.679 --> 02:13:42.581
SO WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE HERE THIS

02:13:42.647 --> 02:13:43.915
IS WHAT FIRE HAZARD JONES LOOK

02:13:43.982 --> 02:13:45.550
LIKE THEY'RE BIG THEY MAKE IT

02:13:45.617 --> 02:13:47.152
DOWN TO SMALLER ACREAGES BUT

02:13:47.219 --> 02:13:48.220
HEY'RE NOT OF THE PARCEL LEVEL

02:13:48.286 --> 02:13:49.788
AND THEY WILL NOT TELL US

02:13:49.855 --> 02:13:51.857
WHETHER WE CAN BUILD ON THAT

02:13:51.923 --> 02:13:52.457
PARTICULAR PIECE OF GROUND OR

02:13:52.524 --> 02:13:54.025
NOT.

02:13:54.092 --> 02:13:56.895
WHY DO WE NEED TO KNOW THIS?

02:13:56.962 --> 02:13:59.431
IT'S BECAUSE IT'S THE WAY THAT

02:13:59.498 --> 02:14:00.866
OTHERS ARE STARTING TO DO THIS.

02:14:00.932 --> 02:14:02.334
I HOW DID THIS IN ANOTHER

02:14:02.401 --> 02:14:04.403
HEARING COLORADO SPRINGS IS AN

02:14:04.469 --> 02:14:05.937
EXAMPLE OTHER COMMUNITIES IN

02:14:06.004 --> 02:14:07.539
CALIFORNIA HAVE STARTED TO DO

02:14:07.606 --> 02:14:10.075
THIS BUT ANALYZING RISK OF THE

02:14:10.142 --> 02:14:10.842
PARTIAL LEVEL WHERE WE'RE

02:14:10.909 --> 02:14:12.344
MEASURING THE MEDICATIONS THAT

02:14:12.411 --> 02:14:13.578
WERE REQUIRING.

02:14:13.645 --> 02:14:15.113
AGAINST THE HAZARD OF THE FIRE

02:14:15.180 --> 02:14:16.848
BEHAVIOR ITSELF WILL START TO

02:14:16.915 --> 02:14:19.050
TELL US IS IT BUILDABLE OR NOT

02:14:19.117 --> 02:14:21.086
BASED ON AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF

02:14:21.153 --> 02:14:22.320
RISK.

02:14:22.387 --> 02:14:23.588
THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ONCE

02:14:23.655 --> 02:14:24.389
YOU'VE IMPLEMENTED THAT

02:14:24.456 --> 02:14:26.091
PROGRAMME ACROSS THE COMMUNITY

02:14:26.158 --> 02:14:27.426
YOU START TO HAVE DISTINCTIONS

02:14:27.492 --> 02:14:28.560
BETWEEN THOSE THAT ARE

02:14:28.627 --> 02:14:30.595
RELATIVELY LOW RISK AND THOSE

02:14:30.662 --> 02:14:32.697
THAT ARE EXTREMELY HIGH.

02:14:32.764 --> 02:14:34.232
SO I BRING THAT TO YOU AS AN

02:14:34.299 --> 02:14:36.902
EXAMPLE COMMUNITY TO LOOK TOWARD --

02:14:36.968 --> 02:14:38.470
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO DESIGN A

02:14:38.537 --> 02:14:39.571
PROGRAM LIKE THAT.

02:14:39.638 --> 02:14:42.641
YOU HAVE MITIGATION METRICS THAT

02:14:42.707 --> 02:14:45.010
ARE ACCESSIBLE AND INFORM

02:14:45.076 --> 02:14:46.144
HOMEOWNERS --

02:14:46.211 --> 02:14:47.746
YOU'VE HEARD A FEW ABOUT SOME OF

02:14:47.813 --> 02:14:49.281
THE APPS IN OTHER.

02:14:49.347 --> 02:14:52.918
PROGRAMS THAT HOMEOWNERS CAN AT

02:14:52.984 --> 02:14:54.119
AND YOU GET DOWN TO THIS

02:14:54.186 --> 02:14:55.554
QUESTION OF WHAT IS A STRUCTURE

02:14:55.620 --> 02:14:56.855
IGNITION'S ON ASSESSMENT LOOK

02:14:56.922 --> 02:14:58.290
LIKE THIS IS WHAT THE BODY OF

02:14:58.356 --> 02:14:59.458
KNOWLEDGE IS OUT THERE IN THE

02:14:59.524 --> 02:15:00.692
FIRE FIGHTING ARENA.

02:15:00.759 --> 02:15:02.527
AND IN THE PLANNING ARENA THAT

02:15:02.594 --> 02:15:04.362
SLOWLY STARTING TO DEVELOP WHY

02:15:04.429 --> 02:15:05.897
IS THAT IMPORTANT IT'S BECAUSE

02:15:05.964 --> 02:15:07.632
THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY METRICS

02:15:07.699 --> 02:15:09.868
RISK THIS WAY THEY LOOK AT THE

02:15:09.935 --> 02:15:11.002
PARTIAL Là OF ALL.

02:15:11.069 --> 02:15:13.171
THEY LOOK AT WHAT A HOME IS LIKE

02:15:13.238 --> 02:15:14.873
THEY MEASURE IT PARTIAL BY

02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:17.108
PARCEL AND THEN THEY COSTS THAT

02:15:17.175 --> 02:15:18.143
OUT THROUGH THE RATE SETTING

02:15:18.210 --> 02:15:19.578
GUIDELINES WITH THE INSURANCE

02:15:19.644 --> 02:15:20.912
COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.

02:15:20.979 --> 02:15:23.281
SO FOR EVERY PROPERTY IN THIS

02:15:23.348 --> 02:15:24.683
STATE THERE'S AN INSURANCE.

02:15:24.749 --> 02:15:26.351
ALGORITHM THAT IS DETERMINING

02:15:26.418 --> 02:15:28.587
RISK AND THAT IS BEHIND WHAT IS

02:15:28.653 --> 02:15:29.688
GOING ON WITH THE RISK STTING

02:15:29.754 --> 02:15:31.690
POLICIES AND LESS OUR PUBLIC

02:15:31.756 --> 02:15:33.692
POLICY AND OUR PUBLIC MAPPING

02:15:33.758 --> 02:15:36.695
POLICIES ALIGN WITH THE

02:15:36.761 --> 02:15:37.863
INSURANCE RISK SETTING.

02:15:37.929 --> 02:15:40.098
METHODOLOGY WE'LL HAVE A BIGGER

02:15:40.165 --> 02:15:41.366
AND BIGGER DISCONNECT.

02:15:41.433 --> 02:15:43.802
WHICH IS WHY I RECOMMEND IN

02:15:43.869 --> 02:15:45.470
RECOMMENDATION NUMBER TWO THAT

02:15:45.537 --> 02:15:46.671
YOU ADOPT BOTH THE ZONING

02:15:46.738 --> 02:15:48.406
OVERLAY WHICH COULD BE TEAR TO

02:15:48.473 --> 02:15:49.541
THE FIRE HAZARD SEVERITIES ON

02:15:49.608 --> 02:15:51.877
MAPS THAT'S A VERY CAPABLE TOOL

02:15:51.943 --> 02:15:53.445
FOR DOING A ZONING OVERLAY.

02:15:53.512 --> 02:15:55.213
BUT IF YOU WANT TO GET DOWN TO A

02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:58.283
RISK ASSESSMENT YOU NEED A MODEL.

02:15:58.350 --> 02:15:59.518
THAT EVERYONE AGREES TO SO IT'S

02:15:59.584 --> 02:16:01.253
CONSISTENTLY A FORCED ACROSS THE

02:16:01.319 --> 02:16:03.788
STATE THAT'S OF A VERY CAPABLE.

02:16:03.855 --> 02:16:05.924
CAL FIRE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OPR

02:16:05.991 --> 02:16:06.992
NOTE -- YES

02:16:07.058 --> 02:16:08.093
WOULD BE VERY CAPABLE IT

02:16:08.159 --> 02:16:09.327
DEVELOPING THAT MODEL AND IT

02:16:09.394 --> 02:16:10.629
WOULD THEN IMPLEMENT AT THE

02:16:10.695 --> 02:16:12.697
LOCAL LEVEL AND THEN THAT DATA

02:16:12.764 --> 02:16:13.932
WOULD MOVE BACK AND FORTH

02:16:13.999 --> 02:16:15.700
BETWEEN STATE AND LOCALS AT THE

02:16:15.767 --> 02:16:16.902
PERSONAL LEVEL THAT IS

02:16:16.968 --> 02:16:19.604
TECHNOLOGICALLY.

02:16:19.671 --> 02:16:20.405
QUITE DOABLE TODAY.

02:16:20.472 --> 02:16:21.306
LASTLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

02:16:21.373 --> 02:16:23.041
EDUCATION AND ENFORCEMENT WE

02:16:23.108 --> 02:16:24.409
HAVE HAD THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE

02:16:24.476 --> 02:16:27.746
ORDINANCE ON THE BOOKS SINCE.

02:16:27.812 --> 02:16:28.413
NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR NOW I'M JUST

02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:30.015
GOING TO MAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A

02:16:30.081 --> 02:16:31.683
LECTURE MOMENT FOR ALL OF US IN

02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:33.418
CALIFORNIA.

02:16:33.485 --> 02:16:35.387
IF WE HAD ENFORCED DEFENSIBLE

02:16:35.453 --> 02:16:38.290
SPACE CONSISTENTLY WHERE IT WAS

02:16:38.356 --> 02:16:41.660
STATUTORILY REQUIRED SINCE

02:16:41.726 --> 02:16:42.661
NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR WE WOULD NOT

02:16:42.727 --> 02:16:44.029
BE IN THE MESS WE'RE IN TODAY.

02:16:44.095 --> 02:16:45.764
WE WOULD HAVE ISSUES AND WE

02:16:45.830 --> 02:16:47.165
WOULD BE HAVING CONVERSATIONS

02:16:47.232 --> 02:16:48.567
ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING

02:16:48.633 --> 02:16:49.401
WITH LAND USE PLANNING AND SOME

02:16:49.467 --> 02:16:50.835
OTHER THINGS BUT WE WOULD HAVE

02:16:50.902 --> 02:16:52.571
GONE A LONG WAY IN ACCOMPLISHING

02:16:52.637 --> 02:16:53.438
THAT.

02:16:53.505 --> 02:16:57.042
SO STATUTORILY.

02:16:57.108 --> 02:16:58.810
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A MANDATE TO

02:16:58.877 --> 02:17:00.312
REQUIREMENTS I SUPPORT THOSE BUT

02:17:00.378 --> 02:17:02.113
IT'S THE CAPACITY BUILDING AND

02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:04.249
THEN ENABLING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:17:04.316 --> 02:17:06.017
TO ACHIEVE THE RESULTS OF THAT

02:17:06.084 --> 02:17:07.652
STATUTE OR REQUIREMENT OR

02:17:07.719 --> 02:17:08.053
MANDATE.

02:17:08.119 --> 02:17:10.255
THAT WE NEED THIS IS WHAT IT'S

02:17:10.322 --> 02:17:13.825
GOING TO LOOK LIKE.

02:17:13.892 --> 02:17:15.794
AT THE TECHNOLOGICAL LEVEL WE

02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:17.796
NEED A SET OF BOOTS UP EVERY

02:17:17.862 --> 02:17:19.698
DRIVE WAY ON TWO MILLION

02:17:19.764 --> 02:17:21.433
PROPERTIES IN THIS STATE TO HAVE

02:17:21.499 --> 02:17:22.767
A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE

02:17:22.834 --> 02:17:23.902
RETROFIT.

02:17:23.969 --> 02:17:25.637
WHAT THEY NEED TO DO?

02:17:25.704 --> 02:17:26.638
HOW TO ENFORCE THE DEFENSIBLE

02:17:26.705 --> 02:17:28.940
SPACE IT NEEDS TO BE?

02:17:29.007 --> 02:17:30.675
REQUIRED.

02:17:30.742 --> 02:17:32.177
AND WE NEED TO HELP LOCAL

02:17:32.243 --> 02:17:34.145
AGENCIES FUND FOR THAT SO THAT'S

02:17:34.212 --> 02:17:35.680
MY RECOMMENDATION IS PUT

02:17:35.747 --> 02:17:36.815
TOGETHER A THREE YEAR BLOCK

02:17:36.881 --> 02:17:38.617
GRANT PROGRAM THE NUMBER OF

02:17:38.683 --> 02:17:39.217
HOMES THAT NEED TO BE

02:17:39.284 --> 02:17:40.352
ACCOMPLISHED.

02:17:40.418 --> 02:17:41.953
IF YOU ROLL IT OVER A THREE YEAR

02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:43.388
PERIOD YOU NEED TO HAVE A BOOT

02:17:43.455 --> 02:17:45.523
UP BOOTS UP THE DRIVEWAY FOR SIX

02:17:45.590 --> 02:17:46.992
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

02:17:47.058 --> 02:17:48.059
PARCELS.

02:17:48.126 --> 02:17:50.328
A YEAR FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS

02:17:50.395 --> 02:17:51.830
TO START TO MAKE SENSE OF THE

02:17:51.896 --> 02:17:53.164
RISK ASSESSMENT.

02:17:53.231 --> 02:17:56.067
THE RETROFIT AND THE DEFENSIBLE

02:17:56.134 --> 02:17:57.435
PEANUT BUTTER THAT ACROSS THE

02:17:57.502 --> 02:17:59.304
COUNTIES NOT NECESSARILY

02:17:59.371 --> 02:18:00.972
ADJUSTING FOR LEVEL OF PARCELS

02:18:01.039 --> 02:18:01.940
BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE TWENTY

02:18:02.007 --> 02:18:04.442
PEOPLE WORKING SIX MONTHS A YEAR

02:18:04.509 --> 02:18:05.910
FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO

02:18:05.977 --> 02:18:07.212
ACCOMPLISH THAT.

02:18:07.278 --> 02:18:09.314
THAT'S A HEAVY LIFT BUT THAT'S

02:18:09.381 --> 02:18:11.249
NOT AN IMPOSSIBLE LEFT WE COULD

02:18:11.316 --> 02:18:13.685
DO THAT. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

02:18:13.752 --> 02:18:15.654
DOLLARS PER HOUSE IS THE IS THE

02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:17.288
COST OF THE MOST REQUIRED

02:18:17.355 --> 02:18:18.890
RETROFITS.

02:18:18.957 --> 02:18:21.426
A ROOF THE VANCE AND THE SOFFIT

02:18:21.493 --> 02:18:23.328
TO EVE'S PLUS THE DEFENSIBLE

02:18:23.395 --> 02:18:25.263
SPACE WILL COST ABOUT TWENTY

02:18:25.330 --> 02:18:26.097
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU'VE

02:18:26.164 --> 02:18:27.265
HEARD FROM BOTH FEMA AND OUR

02:18:27.332 --> 02:18:29.234
CALLOW YES DIRECTOR. EIGHT

02:18:29.300 --> 02:18:30.001
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS

02:18:30.068 --> 02:18:31.870
CURRENTLY IN THE BUCKET TO HELP

02:18:31.936 --> 02:18:34.105
WITH THOSE IF YOU HAVE A 25%

02:18:34.172 --> 02:18:36.141
COST YEAR WITH THE HOMEOWNERS

02:18:36.207 --> 02:18:37.876
25% COST YEAR TO THE STATE AND

02:18:37.942 --> 02:18:40.045
50% FROM FEMA.

02:18:40.111 --> 02:18:42.313
YOU CAN GET THEIR I WANT TO CALL

02:18:42.380 --> 02:18:44.082
YOUR ATTENTION LASTLY TO JUST

02:18:44.149 --> 02:18:45.950
OFF THE PRESSES THIS MONTH'S

02:18:46.017 --> 02:18:47.752
FIREHOUSE MAGAZINE NATIONAL

02:18:47.819 --> 02:18:50.689
MAGAZINE HAS AN ARTICLE ON HOW

02:18:50.755 --> 02:18:52.190
TO TRIAGE STRUCTURES.

02:18:52.257 --> 02:18:53.525
RELATIVE TO FIRE FIGHTING

02:18:53.591 --> 02:18:55.827
TACTICS AND THEY CATEGORIZE THEM

02:18:55.894 --> 02:18:57.729
INTO.

02:18:57.796 --> 02:18:59.297
NON THREATEN STRUCTURES THOSE

02:18:59.364 --> 02:19:00.565
WITH IGNITION RESISTANT

02:19:00.632 --> 02:19:01.633
CONSTRUCTION AND DEFENSIBLE

02:19:01.700 --> 02:19:03.435
SPACE AND A SAFE PLACE FOR

02:19:03.501 --> 02:19:04.803
FIREFIGHTERS IN THE EVENT OF A

02:19:04.869 --> 02:19:05.637
REFUGE.

02:19:05.704 --> 02:19:06.938
THEY HAVE THREATENED BUT

02:19:07.005 --> 02:19:10.241
DEFENSIBLE AND THEN NON.

02:19:10.308 --> 02:19:12.644
NON DEFENSIBLE STRUCTURES THIS

02:19:12.711 --> 02:19:14.079
IS HOW THE FIREFIGHTERS ARE

02:19:14.145 --> 02:19:15.947
LOOKING AT OUR PROPERTIES HOUSE

02:19:16.014 --> 02:19:17.849
BY HOUSE DURING THE FIREFIGHT

02:19:17.916 --> 02:19:19.951
WE NEED TO DO THIS UP EVERY

02:19:20.018 --> 02:19:21.720
DRIVEWAY GATHER THE DATA MAKE IT

02:19:21.786 --> 02:19:23.288
TECHNOLOGICALLY AVAILABLE TO THE

02:19:23.354 --> 02:19:24.422
FIREFIGHTERS.

02:19:24.489 --> 02:19:25.957
LOCAL GOVERNMENT BACK TO THE

02:19:26.024 --> 02:19:28.159
STATES AND BUILD A COMPREHENSIVE

02:19:28.226 --> 02:19:30.662
SYSTEM AND AND WITH THAT I THINK

02:19:30.729 --> 02:19:32.197
YOU I ALSO WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT

02:19:32.263 --> 02:19:32.897
OUT.

02:19:32.964 --> 02:19:34.933
SENATOR STERN TREEPEOPLE AS

02:19:34.999 --> 02:19:36.668
HAVING A WILDFIRE RESILIENCY

02:19:36.735 --> 02:19:38.937
PROGRAM IN YOUR AREA.

02:19:39.003 --> 02:19:40.839
AND I JUST LIKE TO COMPLIMENT

02:19:40.905 --> 02:19:42.173
THEM FOR THAT VERY GOOD.

02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:44.375
I'M GOING TO THAT.

02:19:44.442 --> 02:19:45.577
THANK YOU VERY GOOD I'LL SWITCH

02:19:45.643 --> 02:19:46.244
IT APPEARS POSE COMING STRAIGHT

TO ME.

02:19:47.846 --> 02:19:48.713
AS CHAIR ANY OF THE MEMBERS

02:19:48.780 --> 02:19:49.013
[inaudible]

02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:50.949
MEDIA QUESTIONS.

02:19:51.015 --> 02:19:54.519
I'VE GOT A FEW BUT WE'LL SHARE

02:19:54.586 --> 02:19:56.387
OKAY WHAT I THINK IT COMES DOWN

02:19:56.454 --> 02:19:58.389
TO IS --

02:19:58.456 --> 02:20:01.526
MAKING A PRIORITY IN MONEY

02:20:01.593 --> 02:20:01.826
[inaudible]

02:20:01.893 --> 02:20:03.561
RIGHT -- IN

02:20:03.628 --> 02:20:05.730
IF THE STATE WERE TO PUT.

02:20:05.797 --> 02:20:07.198
IN FORCE WHAT IS ALREADY

02:20:07.265 --> 02:20:08.666
SUPPOSED TO BE ENFORCEABLE

02:20:08.733 --> 02:20:10.402
ACROSS THE STATE.

02:20:10.468 --> 02:20:12.337
AND PUT DOLLARS TOWARDS IT.

02:20:12.403 --> 02:20:13.872
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE JUST

02:20:13.938 --> 02:20:14.906
TALKING ABOUT --

02:20:14.973 --> 02:20:16.341
EMPIRE MARSHALL'S JUST TAKING A

02:20:16.407 --> 02:20:19.244
LOOK AT THREE YEAR PROGRAM FIVE

02:20:19.310 --> 02:20:21.045
YEAR PROGRAM WATER MAY BE --

02:20:21.112 --> 02:20:23.548
BOTTOM LINE.

02:20:23.615 --> 02:20:25.183
HOW LONG YOU THINK IT'LL TAKE ME?

02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:27.152
SIX OR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

02:20:27.218 --> 02:20:29.087
HOUSEHOLDS IN THREE YEARS.

02:20:29.154 --> 02:20:30.288
IT'S PRETTY AGGRESSIVE JUST

02:20:30.355 --> 02:20:31.489
BEING HONEST IS THE WAY THINGS

02:20:31.556 --> 02:20:33.158
MOVE RIGHT IN THE AT RURAL

02:20:33.224 --> 02:20:35.727
COUNTIES IN URBAN COUNTIES IN

02:20:35.794 --> 02:20:36.628
JUST WAY DIFFERENT.

02:20:36.694 --> 02:20:38.863
PLANS MOVE SO.

02:20:38.930 --> 02:20:39.397
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS IT

02:20:39.464 --> 02:20:41.533
REALISTIC TO HAVE A TIME LINE?

02:20:41.599 --> 02:20:43.434
NO THREE YEARS IS NOT A

02:20:43.501 --> 02:20:44.869
REALISTIC GOAL LINE.

02:20:44.936 --> 02:20:48.139
IT IS A GOOD FIRST WAVE TIME.

02:20:48.206 --> 02:20:49.707
IT'S AN ASSESSMENT PERIOD I

02:20:49.774 --> 02:20:51.376
THINK IF YOU PUT YOUR BACKS TO

02:20:51.442 --> 02:20:53.044
IT IN TEN YEARS TO START TO SEE

02:20:53.111 --> 02:20:53.978
A DIFFERENCE.

02:20:54.045 --> 02:20:55.814
IN THE FIRE METRICS A LOS

02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:58.016
METRICS NO THANK YOU SO WE WHEN

02:20:58.082 --> 02:21:00.084
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT DEFENSIBLE

02:21:00.151 --> 02:21:03.721
SPACE IN JUST TALK ABOUT.

02:21:03.788 --> 02:21:04.923
GERMAN IF YOU DON'T MIND

02:21:04.989 --> 02:21:07.659
COMMENTING ON THAT AS WELL.

02:21:07.725 --> 02:21:08.793
I WOULD ONLY SAY FROM VENTURES

02:21:08.860 --> 02:21:11.029
PERSPECTIVE WE LITERALLY ONLY

02:21:11.095 --> 02:21:12.630
ONLY NOTIFY THOSE HOMEOWNERS AT

02:21:12.697 --> 02:21:13.865
THE EDGE --

02:21:13.932 --> 02:21:15.633
AND WE MET WE MISSED 80% OF THE

02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:17.035
HOMEOWNERS I WERE IN THE FIRE

02:21:17.101 --> 02:21:18.436
HAZARD ZONE BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T

02:21:18.503 --> 02:21:20.538
AT THE EDGE SO WE PRIORITIZE

02:21:20.605 --> 02:21:22.006
WITH LIMITED RESOURCES AND

02:21:22.073 --> 02:21:23.775
FRANKLY IT LIVE LIMITED FOCUS IN

02:21:23.842 --> 02:21:25.410
WOULD THAT BE. FOR EXAMPLE WE

02:21:25.476 --> 02:21:27.812
DEBATE ME NOTICES OR YES OKAY SO

02:21:27.879 --> 02:21:29.080
WHAT DOES IT WE HAVE FORCED THE

02:21:29.147 --> 02:21:30.982
RULES ON PART OF THE PROPERTIES

02:21:31.049 --> 02:21:32.584
THAT WERE SUBJECT TO THE RULES --

02:21:32.650 --> 02:21:34.352
BECAUSE OF LIMITED RESOURCES AND

02:21:34.419 --> 02:21:36.321
THE JUST THE AND IT ACTUALLY

02:21:36.387 --> 02:21:38.523
PROBABLY MORE ALSO TO AVOID TO

02:21:38.590 --> 02:21:40.325
THE PANIC FROM A LARGER GROUP OF

02:21:40.391 --> 02:21:40.825
HOMEOWNERS.

02:21:40.892 --> 02:21:42.560
BUT HAD WE REALLY ENFORCE THE

02:21:42.627 --> 02:21:43.862
RULES ACROSS EVERYBODY THAT WAS

02:21:43.928 --> 02:21:45.430
SUBJECT TO THOSE RULES WE WOULD

02:21:45.496 --> 02:21:46.731
HAVE HAD LESS DAMAGE AND ARE FAR

02:21:46.798 --> 02:21:48.633
SOUNDS BECAUSE THE FIRE JUMPED

02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:49.534
THE EDGES AND WENT INTO THE

02:21:49.601 --> 02:21:49.934
MIDDLE.

02:21:50.001 --> 02:21:50.635
SO WITH THE GRANTS THAT ARE

02:21:50.702 --> 02:21:52.103
BEING THAT ARE BEING MOVED NOW

02:21:52.170 --> 02:21:54.372
BY CAL FIRE ---THAT --

02:21:54.439 --> 02:21:59.544
GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES CAN SECURE --

02:21:59.611 --> 02:22:00.078
WORKING WITH NEIGHBORHOOD

02:22:00.144 --> 02:22:01.679
ASSOCIATIONS FOR EXAMPLE CITIES

02:22:01.746 --> 02:22:02.247
COUNTIES FIRE DISTRICTS --

02:22:02.313 --> 02:22:05.617
CC SIX ADDRESS.

02:22:05.683 --> 02:22:07.151
EATING ADICIONAL PENETRATION

02:22:07.218 --> 02:22:09.153
WITH IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS JEEZ

02:22:09.220 --> 02:22:11.522
WOULD IT BE HELPFUL IF WE DO A

02:22:11.589 --> 02:22:12.891
MORE TARGETED APPROACH.

02:22:12.957 --> 02:22:13.892
WITH CAL FIRE NON ON THOSE

02:22:13.958 --> 02:22:15.527
GRANTS.

02:22:15.593 --> 02:22:17.095
YEAH I THINK THAT I THINK THAT

02:22:17.161 --> 02:22:18.296
WOULD HELP A LOT --

02:22:18.363 --> 02:22:20.331
WE JUST SO YOU YOU ALL KNOW WE

02:22:20.398 --> 02:22:22.500
DID POST A FIRE IN OUR COMMUNITY

02:22:22.567 --> 02:22:24.035
THE NEXT YEAR WE DID NOTIFY

02:22:24.102 --> 02:22:25.303
EVERYBODY WE SORT OF LEARNED

02:22:25.370 --> 02:22:27.038
THAT LESSON --

02:22:27.105 --> 02:22:28.006
BUT I'M NOT SO CERTAIN THAT A

02:22:28.072 --> 02:22:29.574
CITY LIKE OURS COULD SUSTAIN

02:22:29.641 --> 02:22:31.843
THAT ANNUAL NOTIFICATION GOING

02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:33.444
FOR WITHOUT SOME ADDITIONAL

02:22:33.511 --> 02:22:34.946
RESOURCES KIND THANK YOU.

02:22:35.013 --> 02:22:35.680
I THINK FROM RESEARCH STUDIES

02:22:35.747 --> 02:22:37.248
THAT.

02:22:37.315 --> 02:22:39.350
THE SIGNAL DEFENSIBLE SPACE DOES

02:22:39.417 --> 02:22:39.884
ACTUALLY TURNED OUT TO BE

02:22:39.951 --> 02:22:41.686
IMPORTANT SO --

02:22:41.753 --> 02:22:43.288
SO YES I THINK THAT YOU KNOW

02:22:43.354 --> 02:22:44.989
THERE'S NO THERE'S NO QUESTION

02:22:45.056 --> 02:22:46.324
THAT IT'S ENFORCING IT --

02:22:46.391 --> 02:22:48.693
EXPAND THE STEP IN THE RIGHT

02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:50.561
DIRECTION --

02:22:50.628 --> 02:22:52.163
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE VERY

02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:53.331
IMPORTANT BEYOND ABOUT A HUNDRED

02:22:53.398 --> 02:22:54.666
FEET SO THIS IDEA THAT WE'RE

02:22:54.732 --> 02:22:55.900
GONNA DO DEFENSIBLE SPACE OUT

02:22:55.967 --> 02:22:58.436
INTO THE THE THE HINTERLAND AND

02:22:58.503 --> 02:23:00.238
AND DO SOME GOOD ISN'T SUPPORTED

02:23:00.305 --> 02:23:01.406
BY.

02:23:01.472 --> 02:23:02.106
BY THE WITH FEW STUDIES THERE

02:23:02.173 --> 02:23:04.075
ARE -- BUT I

02:23:04.142 --> 02:23:05.743
DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN.

02:23:05.810 --> 02:23:07.278
DO THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE PART

02:23:07.345 --> 02:23:08.746
WITHOUT THE STRUCTURE HARDENING

02:23:08.813 --> 02:23:10.615
PART THEY HAVE TO GO HAND IN

02:23:10.682 --> 02:23:12.216
HAND BECAUSE IF YOU DO

02:23:12.283 --> 02:23:13.818
DEFENSIBLE SPACE USED.

02:23:13.885 --> 02:23:14.852
YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING IN

02:23:14.919 --> 02:23:16.054
YOU SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF

02:23:16.120 --> 02:23:18.356
RESOURCES TO DO IT BUT YOU'RE

02:23:18.423 --> 02:23:19.691
NOT GOING TO GET WHAT YOU WHAT

02:23:19.757 --> 02:23:20.224
YOU.

02:23:20.291 --> 02:23:21.526
NEED TO I'M REALLY GLAD YOU

02:23:21.592 --> 02:23:24.095
MENTIONED THAT AND I THINK SHE

02:23:24.162 --> 02:23:26.798
CANNOT WAIT ON THIS IN THE NORTH

02:23:26.864 --> 02:23:28.132
A FIRE STORM.

02:23:28.199 --> 02:23:30.835
IMMERSE REFINED ABOUT TWO MILES

02:23:30.902 --> 02:23:31.469
AHEAD OF THE FRONT LINES OF THE

02:23:31.536 --> 02:23:32.603
FIRE.

02:23:32.670 --> 02:23:34.339
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH

02:23:34.405 --> 02:23:36.841
THAT WHOLE KMART SHOPPING CENTER

02:23:36.908 --> 02:23:37.442
THIRTEEN HUNDRED HOMES A COPY

02:23:37.508 --> 02:23:38.543
PARK AT THE PARK.

02:23:38.609 --> 02:23:42.547
IS ALMOST THREE MILES AWAY FROM

02:23:42.613 --> 02:23:44.248
ANY TYPE OF GROWTH --

02:23:44.315 --> 02:23:46.517
WITHIN A WEEK AIDS IN THE MIDDLE

02:23:46.584 --> 02:23:48.119
FLIPPING TOWN --

02:23:48.186 --> 02:23:50.288
AND THAT'S THE OTHER ISSUE THAT

02:23:50.355 --> 02:23:52.523
WE ARE SEEN --

02:23:52.590 --> 02:23:54.892
IN WILL ASK THE CHIEF --

02:23:54.959 --> 02:23:57.128
TO AS WELL.

02:23:57.195 --> 02:23:59.163
THE AMBER FLOW THAT WERE SEEN

02:23:59.230 --> 02:24:00.631
FROM THESE FIRES --

02:24:00.698 --> 02:24:02.333
IS IT'S ASTRONOMICAL AS FAR AS

02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:04.869
WHAT HOW FAST THIS IS MOVING IN

02:24:04.936 --> 02:24:05.803
HOW FAR THESE NUMBERS ARE NOW

02:24:05.870 --> 02:24:06.771
FLYING --

02:24:06.838 --> 02:24:09.974
AND PLANNING ON ROOFS MANY

02:24:10.041 --> 02:24:11.009
VEGETATION.

02:24:11.075 --> 02:24:12.043
SO I AYE GREETING REQUIRES A

02:24:12.110 --> 02:24:13.811
HARDENING YEAH AND THAT'S WHY

02:24:13.878 --> 02:24:15.947
YOU DON'T SEE A BIG A BIG SIGNAL

02:24:16.014 --> 02:24:17.715
VEGETATION BEYOND A CERTAIN

02:24:17.782 --> 02:24:19.083
AMOUNT BECAUSE EMBERS CAN BE

02:24:19.150 --> 02:24:20.718
COMING FROM FAR FAR AWAY.

02:24:20.785 --> 02:24:22.186
AND MOST HOMES ACTUALLY DO BURN

02:24:22.253 --> 02:24:24.122
FROM FROM MEMBERS RIGHT AND

02:24:24.188 --> 02:24:26.357
EITHER FROM AWHILE THEN FIRE OR

02:24:26.424 --> 02:24:27.892
FROM A NEIGHBORING HOME.

02:24:27.959 --> 02:24:29.327
THAT'S BURNING SO HARDENING

02:24:29.394 --> 02:24:30.762
HARDEN THE STRUCTURES.

02:24:30.828 --> 02:24:32.463
BUT GO BACK TO TO WHAT I WAS

02:24:32.530 --> 02:24:33.598
FINDING FROM --

02:24:33.664 --> 02:24:35.133
FROM LAND USE PLANNERS ACTUALLY

02:24:35.199 --> 02:24:36.567
LAYING THE COMMUNITY OUT

02:24:36.634 --> 02:24:37.802
DIFFERENTLY.

02:24:37.869 --> 02:24:40.171
HAS A BIG IMPACT AND WE'RE NOT

02:24:40.238 --> 02:24:41.773
WE'RE GENERALLY NOT EVEN

02:24:41.839 --> 02:24:42.840
DISCUSSING THAT AND I THINK

02:24:42.907 --> 02:24:43.975
THAT'S A AN IMPORTANT.

02:24:44.042 --> 02:24:45.243
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THAT'S

02:24:45.309 --> 02:24:46.544
FALLING SHORT OF SAYING YOU

02:24:46.611 --> 02:24:48.179
CAN'T BUILD THERE THAT'S SAYING

02:24:48.246 --> 02:24:49.380
OKAY IF YOU'RE GONNA BUILD THERE

02:24:49.447 --> 02:24:51.315
LET'S DO IT DIFFERENTLY THAT'S

02:24:51.382 --> 02:24:53.351
DO IT SMARTER SO THAT'S ACTUALLY --

02:24:53.418 --> 02:24:54.452
FALLING SHORT OF OF THAT

02:24:54.519 --> 02:24:55.620
DIFFICULT CONVERSATION

02:24:55.686 --> 02:24:55.920
[inaudible]

02:24:55.987 --> 02:24:58.189
THANK YOU.

02:24:58.256 --> 02:25:00.691
KERN WHAT SORRY LOSS --

02:25:00.758 --> 02:25:03.227
SENATOR BILL SORRY YOUR NEXT

02:25:03.294 --> 02:25:03.528
[inaudible]

02:25:03.594 --> 02:25:06.631
OF ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AGO I HAD A

02:25:06.697 --> 02:25:08.933
MEETING IN LOS GATOS SAW ON

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.636
EMERGENCY SERVICES --

02:25:11.702 --> 02:25:12.403
WITH --

02:25:12.470 --> 02:25:14.338

SIR TO THE SAN JOSE WE WERE

02:25:16.107 --> 02:25:17.675
TALKING ABOUT THE THE SANTA CRUZ

02:25:17.742 --> 02:25:19.010
MOUNTAINS.

02:25:19.077 --> 02:25:21.212
IN THE FOOTHILLS ABOVE THOSE

02:25:21.279 --> 02:25:23.114
TOWNS AND THEIR ENOUGH FIRE

02:25:23.181 --> 02:25:26.017
SEVERE THING --

02:25:26.084 --> 02:25:27.318
THAT'S EXISTING --

02:25:27.385 --> 02:25:29.520
FROM THE CAL FIRE THERE IN THE

02:25:29.587 --> 02:25:31.222
WHAT THEY CALL THE RED ZONE.

02:25:31.289 --> 02:25:32.190
THOSE AREAS BECAUSE THERE'S A

02:25:32.256 --> 02:25:35.460
LARGE AMOUNT OF HOUSING THAT WAS

02:25:35.526 --> 02:25:38.930
BUILT TO A HUNDRED YEARS AGO

02:25:38.996 --> 02:25:40.298
FIFTY YEARS AGO ALL UP IN THE

02:25:40.364 --> 02:25:41.566
MOUNTAINS UP THERE.

02:25:41.632 --> 02:25:44.335
AND THERE'S ALSO BEEN SEVERAL

02:25:44.402 --> 02:25:46.304
FIRES AND GONE THROUGH THEIR AND

02:25:46.370 --> 02:25:48.406
THEIR THE REGROWTH --

02:25:48.473 --> 02:25:50.141
IS QUITE THICK.

02:25:50.208 --> 02:25:52.210
UP THERE SO IT'S WE ALSO HAVE A

02:25:52.276 --> 02:25:53.411
THING CALLED THE SAN ANDREAS

02:25:53.478 --> 02:25:55.113
FAULT THERE ARE.

02:25:55.179 --> 02:25:56.814
SO WE HAVE LIKE A COMBINATION OF

02:25:56.881 --> 02:25:59.117
THINGS GOING ON SO WE HAD THIS

02:25:59.183 --> 02:26:00.651
COMMUNITY ME WE HAVE LIKE OVER

02:26:00.718 --> 02:26:02.186
THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE SHOW UP.

02:26:02.253 --> 02:26:05.523
AND THE THE THE THE KINDA ISSUES

02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:09.026
WERE WHAT CAN WE DO TO BEEF UP

02:26:09.093 --> 02:26:09.327
[inaudible]

02:26:09.393 --> 02:26:11.229
THE INSPECTIONS [inaudible]

02:26:11.295 --> 02:26:17.602
OF HOMES ROSE --

02:26:17.668 --> 02:26:20.371
THE PUBLIC LANDS OWNED BY THE

02:26:20.438 --> 02:26:22.273
PARKS DISTRICTS.

02:26:22.340 --> 02:26:24.542
ALL THESE KINDS OF THINGS --

02:26:24.609 --> 02:26:26.210
AN AREA THAT'S ALREADY.

02:26:26.277 --> 02:26:27.411
HAD.

02:26:27.478 --> 02:26:29.580
A LOT OF HOUSING BUILT IN IT BUT

02:26:29.647 --> 02:26:33.117
IT'S IN A REALLY A HI

02:26:33.184 --> 02:26:35.920
PROBABILITY OF FIRE AREA.

02:26:35.987 --> 02:26:37.922
SO HOW DO YOU DO WITH THE THOSE

02:26:37.989 --> 02:26:39.123
KINDS OF AREAS --

02:26:39.190 --> 02:26:41.692
THAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF A

02:26:41.759 --> 02:26:43.561
PLANNING PROCESS --

02:26:43.628 --> 02:26:46.831
SHOULD WE PUT THE STRICTER OF

02:26:46.898 --> 02:26:48.499
LAND USE REQUIREMENTS.

02:26:48.566 --> 02:26:52.503
ON THOSE AREAS OF CCAR'S --

02:26:52.570 --> 02:26:54.005
SHOULD WE HAVE.

02:26:54.071 --> 02:26:56.807
OUR HOME INSPECTIONS OF HOME

02:26:56.874 --> 02:26:58.209
INSPECTIONS WHEN THE HOUSE IS

02:26:58.276 --> 02:26:59.277
SOLD.

02:26:59.343 --> 02:27:00.411
WHAT KIND OF THINGS CAN WE DO

02:27:00.478 --> 02:27:01.879
THE?

02:27:01.946 --> 02:27:03.681
B..

02:27:03.748 --> 02:27:04.849
FIVE FOUR THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE

02:27:04.916 --> 02:27:06.751
IN --

02:27:06.817 --> 02:27:08.219
PREVENTION ACTIVITIES IN THOSE

02:27:08.286 --> 02:27:10.755
AREAS THOSE KINDS OF AREAS.

02:27:10.821 --> 02:27:12.123
YOU KNOW THE SOUND OF YOUR FROM

02:27:12.190 --> 02:27:13.558
AREA TO AREA TALKING BUT I GREW

02:27:13.624 --> 02:27:15.159
UP IN HALF MOON BAY AND MY FIRST

02:27:15.226 --> 02:27:17.295
FIRE STATION ASSIGNMENT WAS FELT

02:27:17.361 --> 02:27:19.263
IN SO I AM.

02:27:19.330 --> 02:27:22.300
AND SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES

02:27:22.366 --> 02:27:25.369
YES YES AND YES ALL OF THE ABOVE --

02:27:25.436 --> 02:27:27.205
ARE ARE YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE

02:27:27.271 --> 02:27:28.906
TRYING TO CREATE A REQUIREMENT

02:27:28.973 --> 02:27:30.041
THAT YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR ALL OF

02:27:30.107 --> 02:27:31.475
THE POINTS OF CONTACT WITH THAT

02:27:31.542 --> 02:27:32.476
PROPERTY.

02:27:32.543 --> 02:27:34.912
YOU KNOW THAT MAKES SENSE SO YOU

02:27:34.979 --> 02:27:36.847
KNOW IF I WERE YOU KNOW WAVING A

02:27:36.914 --> 02:27:37.982
WAND.

02:27:38.049 --> 02:27:39.617
AND I WERE CALIFORNIA AND TRYING

02:27:39.684 --> 02:27:41.118
TO DO THIS AS QUICKLY AS I. POP

02:27:41.185 --> 02:27:42.153
POSSIBLY COULD.

02:27:42.220 --> 02:27:43.020
THEN -- I

02:27:43.087 --> 02:27:45.856
WOULD PUT CONDITION SAY ALL

02:27:45.923 --> 02:27:47.491
SUBSEQUENT DECISIONS ABOUT THIS

02:27:47.558 --> 02:27:48.693
PROPERTY --

02:27:48.759 --> 02:27:50.361
IT NEED TO COMPLY WITH THE WITH

02:27:50.428 --> 02:27:51.762
THE CONDITIONS ATTACHED TO THE

02:27:51.829 --> 02:27:52.964
ZONING OVERLAY --

02:27:53.030 --> 02:27:55.099
AND SO I WOULDUSE THAT AS AN

02:27:55.166 --> 02:27:56.901
EMBEDDING PROCESS AND THEN I

02:27:56.968 --> 02:27:57.768
WOULD --

02:27:57.835 --> 02:28:00.204
TAKE A LOOK AT THE POINTS OF

02:28:00.271 --> 02:28:01.105
SALE.

02:28:01.172 --> 02:28:02.206
BECAUSE THAT IS ANOTHER POINT

02:28:02.273 --> 02:28:03.574
WHERE THE PROPERTY GOES THROUGH

02:28:03.641 --> 02:28:05.076
A PROCESS I KNOW IT'S UNPOPULAR

02:28:05.142 --> 02:28:06.777
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CONTROVERSIAL

02:28:06.844 --> 02:28:08.813
BUT IT IS EFFECTIVE --

02:28:08.879 --> 02:28:09.880
AND THEN I WOULD --

02:28:09.947 --> 02:28:11.215
I WOULD BE THOUGHT MY

02:28:11.282 --> 02:28:12.650
CONVERSATION WITH THE INSURANCE

02:28:12.717 --> 02:28:15.353
COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE THERE ARE.

02:28:15.419 --> 02:28:16.754
A THERE ARE.

02:28:16.821 --> 02:28:18.723
LITERALLY THOSE BOOTS ON THE

02:28:18.789 --> 02:28:20.057
GROUND GOING UP THOSE DRIVEWAYS

02:28:20.124 --> 02:28:20.891
TAKING A LOOK AT THOSE

02:28:20.958 --> 02:28:22.493
PROPERTIES AND THERE IS --

02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:24.862
SOME LEVERAGING OF COMMON

02:28:24.929 --> 02:28:26.597
PURPOSE INCOME AND EXPENSE OF IT

02:28:26.664 --> 02:28:27.732
COULD BE HAD IN PARTNERING WITH

02:28:27.798 --> 02:28:29.934
THE INSURANCE PROCESS AS WELL.

02:28:30.001 --> 02:28:33.271
AND AND THEN TO YOUR QUESTION

02:28:33.337 --> 02:28:33.671
ABOUT.

02:28:33.738 --> 02:28:35.473
THE NEED FOR INSPECTIONS I THINK

02:28:35.539 --> 02:28:37.308
THERE IS GOING TO END UP BEING A

02:28:37.375 --> 02:28:38.709
KIND OF A TWO TIERED APPROACH

02:28:38.776 --> 02:28:40.478
THERE IS AN ASSESSMENT PROCESS

02:28:40.544 --> 02:28:42.947
THAT CAN BE DONE BY RELATIVELY.

02:28:43.014 --> 02:28:44.815
A LESS EDUCATED AND MORE

02:28:44.882 --> 02:28:46.851
COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS OF THAT

02:28:46.917 --> 02:28:48.686
ARE LIKE THE LOCAL FIRE SAFE

02:28:48.753 --> 02:28:50.154
COUNCILS FIRE WAYS COMMUNITIES

02:28:50.221 --> 02:28:51.656
THAT TALK WITH HOMEOWNERS AND

02:28:51.722 --> 02:28:53.424
THOSE ARE PEOPLE THAT USE THE

02:28:53.491 --> 02:28:54.792
COMMUNITY BASED PROCESS.

02:28:54.859 --> 02:28:55.793
JUST TELL TOPIC TO TALK ABOUT

02:28:55.860 --> 02:28:58.496
WHAT THEY AND THEN THERE'S IN

02:28:58.562 --> 02:29:00.197
ENFORCING PROCESS WITH SOMEONE

02:29:00.264 --> 02:29:01.632
WHO COMES UP THE DRIVEWAY AND

02:29:01.699 --> 02:29:02.566
RIGHT TO TICKET.

02:29:02.633 --> 02:29:04.702
IF YOU HAVEN'T COMPLIED WE COULD

02:29:04.769 --> 02:29:06.871
SEPARATE THOSE IN IN IN IN AN

02:29:06.937 --> 02:29:09.173
ENABLE THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS

02:29:09.240 --> 02:29:10.675
WITH COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS

02:29:10.741 --> 02:29:12.243
WHILE THE SAME TIME.

02:29:12.310 --> 02:29:13.244
YOU KNOW SENDING SOME MONEY

02:29:13.311 --> 02:29:14.378
ASIDE FOR THE ENFORCEMENT

02:29:14.445 --> 02:29:17.682
PROCESS IT BECOMES THE MANDATE

02:29:17.748 --> 02:29:19.684
THE STATE --

02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:21.385
I KIND OF ROOM THAT'S KIND OF

02:29:21.452 --> 02:29:24.488
WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT --

02:29:24.555 --> 02:29:26.557
SHOULD THE STATE GET INVOLVED IN

02:29:26.624 --> 02:29:28.659
SUPPORTING THESE --

02:29:28.726 --> 02:29:31.362
PUBLIC INFORMATION ACTIVITIES

02:29:31.429 --> 02:29:34.332
MORE FUNDING AND SO FORTH THAT

02:29:34.398 --> 02:29:35.599
THE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS.

02:29:35.666 --> 02:29:38.202
GO OUT AND DO THESE --

02:29:38.269 --> 02:29:39.937
INFORMATIONAL.

02:29:40.004 --> 02:29:42.340
INFORMATIONAL THINGS FOR

02:29:42.406 --> 02:29:43.741
HOMEOWNERS OR RESIDENTS THAT

02:29:43.808 --> 02:29:46.444
LIVE IN THESE AREAS.

02:29:46.510 --> 02:29:47.611
YEAH YES.

02:29:47.678 --> 02:29:48.913
AND BECAUSE IT'S THOSE COMMUNITY

02:29:48.979 --> 02:29:50.715
BASED GROUPS THAT HAVE THE

02:29:50.781 --> 02:29:52.883
RELATIONSHIPS ARE THAT ARE GOING

02:29:52.950 --> 02:29:55.086
TO HELP ENABLE THIS IN THE MOST

02:29:55.152 --> 02:29:56.120
SOCIALLY.

02:29:56.187 --> 02:29:57.722
JUST LESS DISRUPTIVE WAY

02:29:57.788 --> 02:29:59.523
POSSIBLE AND USING COMMUNITY

02:29:59.590 --> 02:30:00.391
BASED GROUPS.

02:30:00.458 --> 02:30:02.259
ARE TO CARRY THE MESSAGE OUT

02:30:02.326 --> 02:30:03.861
THERE -- BUT

02:30:03.928 --> 02:30:05.696
THROUGH AN ENABLED PROCESS YOU

02:30:05.763 --> 02:30:07.498
KNOW MAKING THOSE AVAILABLE

02:30:07.565 --> 02:30:09.867
FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THOSE GROUPS --

02:30:09.934 --> 02:30:11.602
WILL HELP RATHER THAN JUST THE

02:30:11.669 --> 02:30:13.170
APPROACH OF THE ENFORCING AS THE

02:30:13.237 --> 02:30:16.173
FIRST CONTACT AND AND THAT WILL

02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:18.342
BE IMPORTANT --

02:30:18.409 --> 02:30:19.777
SINCE IT IS TO BE MANNER.

02:30:19.844 --> 02:30:21.445
LONG TIME AGO.

02:30:21.512 --> 02:30:22.680
WHILE AGO.

02:30:22.747 --> 02:30:23.681
I ACTUALLY --

02:30:23.748 --> 02:30:26.584
WAS A PLANNER FOR LOS GATOS.

02:30:26.650 --> 02:30:29.253
AND WE DID THE PUBLIC SAFETY

02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:31.021
PLAN.

02:30:31.088 --> 02:30:32.223
BUT I WAS INVOLVED IN WRITING

02:30:32.289 --> 02:30:34.024
THAT -- THE

02:30:34.091 --> 02:30:36.694
PUBLIC SAFETY PLANS --

02:30:36.761 --> 02:30:39.964
WE DID -- OF

02:30:40.030 --> 02:30:42.299
BEFORE COMPUTERS SUPPORTERS

02:30:42.366 --> 02:30:43.768
CAUSES NAILS STONE AGE WHEN I

02:30:43.834 --> 02:30:45.736
WAS THERE BUT WE DID WHAT WE

02:30:45.803 --> 02:30:46.670
CALL -- I

02:30:46.737 --> 02:30:48.105
DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER THIS --

02:30:48.172 --> 02:30:51.342
OVERLY RISK ASSESSMENTS.

02:30:51.409 --> 02:30:52.343
WITH WE CALLED IT MY CAR AGAIN

02:30:52.410 --> 02:30:53.944
RISK ASSESSMENTS O A FEW MEMBER

02:30:54.011 --> 02:30:54.745
THAT.

02:30:54.812 --> 02:30:57.314
YOU DO OKAY SO SO WE DID --

02:30:57.381 --> 02:31:01.218
THOSE KINDS OF ANALYSIS AND WE

02:31:01.285 --> 02:31:02.653
THE WORSE.

02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:05.256
THE MORE TARGETED AREAS.

02:31:05.322 --> 02:31:06.757
AND THAT THOSE ARE THE AREAS

02:31:06.824 --> 02:31:09.693
THAT WE FOCUS ON FIRST.

02:31:09.760 --> 02:31:12.930
AS THE HIGHEST RHYS AREAS IS

02:31:12.997 --> 02:31:15.065
THAT A GOOD APPROACH --

02:31:15.132 --> 02:31:17.268
TO START WORKING ON THIS PROBLEM

02:31:17.334 --> 02:31:20.571
BY FOCUSSING ON THE HARD THE THE

02:31:20.638 --> 02:31:22.273
ONES THAT HAVE SO MUCH OVERLY

02:31:22.339 --> 02:31:23.841
RISK.

02:31:23.908 --> 02:31:25.342
THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING

02:31:25.409 --> 02:31:27.278
MORE IN AN IMMEDIATE WAY.

02:31:27.344 --> 02:31:28.145
I WOULD SAY YES IT'S REALLY

02:31:28.212 --> 02:31:29.547
ABOUT TRIAGE RIGHT YOU KNOW WHAT

02:31:29.613 --> 02:31:30.347
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

02:31:30.414 --> 02:31:32.716
WHEN I DO THESE RISKS OVERLAYS

02:31:32.783 --> 02:31:34.018
HAVE YOU OVERLAY MULTIPLE RECESS

02:31:34.084 --> 02:31:35.319
WHERE THE PROPHET HAD THE MOST

02:31:35.386 --> 02:31:36.720
POTENTIAL RISK ACROSS DIFFERENT

02:31:36.787 --> 02:31:39.023
CATEGORIES PRIORITIZE THEM FIRST

02:31:39.089 --> 02:31:39.790
BECAUSE YOU GET THE BIGGEST BANG

02:31:39.857 --> 02:31:41.392
FOR THE BUCK IF THE BIGGEST BANG

02:31:41.459 --> 02:31:42.293
FOR YOUR BUCK?

02:31:42.359 --> 02:31:43.327
AND THERE WE AND THEN WE AT THE

02:31:43.394 --> 02:31:46.363
COMMUNITY MEETING WE TALKED

02:31:46.430 --> 02:31:47.231
ABOUT --

02:31:47.298 --> 02:31:48.866
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF INSPECTIONS

02:31:48.933 --> 02:31:51.235
AND REQUIREMENTS AND SO WE

02:31:51.302 --> 02:31:54.171
TALKED ABOUT --

02:31:54.238 --> 02:31:56.607
LIKE I USED TO DO WHAT WE CALL

02:31:56.674 --> 02:31:59.043
SOFT INSPECTIONS.

02:31:59.109 --> 02:32:01.078
THEN A THAT WAS INSPECTION YOU

02:32:01.145 --> 02:32:03.347
GO AND YOU COULD JEWEL THE

02:32:03.414 --> 02:32:05.282
HOMEOWNER TO DO THINGS --

02:32:05.349 --> 02:32:07.017
MISTER CHAIRMAN I WAS GOOD AT

02:32:07.084 --> 02:32:08.018
THAT.

02:32:08.085 --> 02:32:09.386
SO I WOULD I WOULD HAVE LIKED A

02:32:09.453 --> 02:32:11.622
LITTLE DISCUSSIONS WITH PEOPLE

02:32:11.689 --> 02:32:13.424
AND SAY WELL YOU KNOW YOU HAVE

02:32:13.491 --> 02:32:14.458
TO DO.

02:32:14.525 --> 02:32:16.527
THESE KINDS OF THINGS AND THEN

02:32:16.594 --> 02:32:17.628
LATER.

02:32:17.695 --> 02:32:19.930
WE WOULD SAY OKAY WE'RE GOING TO

02:32:19.997 --> 02:32:22.900
SCHEDULE LATER A IN IT --

02:32:22.967 --> 02:32:24.502
HARDER INSPECTION THAT WE'RE

02:32:24.568 --> 02:32:26.971
GONNA MAKE THE REQUIREMENTS.

02:32:27.037 --> 02:32:29.373
IS THAT A GOOD APPROACH SO WE DO

02:32:29.440 --> 02:32:31.008
THE COMMUNITY INFORMATION.

02:32:31.075 --> 02:32:32.176
AND THEN WE DO THE SOFT

02:32:32.243 --> 02:32:34.178
INSPECTION AND THEN WE DO THE

02:32:34.245 --> 02:32:36.046
HARD INSPECTION.

02:32:36.113 --> 02:32:37.982
THAT PROCESS IT'S A THREE STEP

02:32:38.048 --> 02:32:39.617
YEAH THAT'S EXACTLY THE I THINK

02:32:39.683 --> 02:32:40.351
THE BEST WAY TO GET THE

02:32:40.417 --> 02:32:42.119
COMMUNITY TO TO REMOVE CHANGE

02:32:42.186 --> 02:32:42.753
BEHAVIOR.

02:32:42.820 --> 02:32:45.155
I THINK I WOULD ADD ALSO THAT IF

02:32:45.222 --> 02:32:46.257
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE AN INSPECTION

02:32:46.323 --> 02:32:47.892
THE PERSON YOU'RE MOST LIKELY TO

02:32:47.958 --> 02:32:48.726
WANT TO SEE IF YOUR HOUSE IS A

02:32:48.792 --> 02:32:49.727
FIREMAN.

02:32:49.793 --> 02:32:51.362
YEAH RIGHT THERE WELL LIKED --

02:32:51.428 --> 02:32:54.465
FOR THE ADD TO THIS A LITTLE

02:32:54.532 --> 02:32:55.866
SENSE OF URGENCY RIGHT NOW

02:32:55.933 --> 02:32:56.700
BECAUSE OF THAT WHAT WE'VE

02:32:56.767 --> 02:32:58.235
EXPERIENCED LAST COUPLE YEARS I

02:32:58.302 --> 02:32:59.703
THINK THERE'S A MORE COMMON

02:32:59.770 --> 02:33:00.804
SENSE OF URGENCY THAT WE SHOULD

02:33:00.871 --> 02:33:02.039
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT SO THOSE

02:33:02.106 --> 02:33:03.007
HOMEOWNERS THAT.

02:33:03.073 --> 02:33:05.276
SURVIVED THE FIRE MIGHT BE MORE

02:33:05.342 --> 02:33:07.411
PRONE TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS

02:33:07.478 --> 02:33:08.279
TO THEIR HOME TO HARDEN HOME

02:33:08.345 --> 02:33:09.179
TODAY AS A NO WITH THE

02:33:09.246 --> 02:33:10.548
ALTERNATIVE IS IF THEY DON'T DO

02:33:10.614 --> 02:33:11.248
THAT.

02:33:11.315 --> 02:33:12.249
I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR THE

02:33:12.316 --> 02:33:14.652
PLANNERS TO LEARN HELPING SKILLS

02:33:14.718 --> 02:33:15.619
TO JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW AND ON

02:33:15.686 --> 02:33:18.522
THE ON RATHER JUST BEING

02:33:18.589 --> 02:33:19.390
REGULATORS YEAH.

02:33:19.456 --> 02:33:20.124
IT'S IMPORTANT AS

02:33:20.190 --> 02:33:21.225
PSYCHOLOGICALLY FOR THE PLANNERS

02:33:21.292 --> 02:33:22.259
TO THAT HELPING.

02:33:22.326 --> 02:33:25.262
THE POINT BUT MISTER CHAIRMAN

02:33:25.329 --> 02:33:27.264
THE OTHER THE OTHER --

02:33:27.331 --> 02:33:28.632
THE LAST ISSUE I WANNA RAISES.

02:33:28.699 --> 02:33:31.835
SIR OF FUNDING AND WHAT WOULD BE

02:33:31.902 --> 02:33:33.437
THE PRIORITY OF FUNDING AT THIS

02:33:33.504 --> 02:33:35.072
POINT IN TERMS OF THESE KINDS OF

02:33:35.139 --> 02:33:36.340
THINGS WOULD YOU SAY.

02:33:36.407 --> 02:33:37.708
YOU MENTION --

02:33:37.775 --> 02:33:40.244
ONE ASPECT YOU HAVE EITHER THE

02:33:40.311 --> 02:33:41.979
ELEMENTS THAT YOU WOULD YOU HAVE

02:33:42.046 --> 02:33:43.914
TO DO RIGHT AWAY KIND OF KIND OF

02:33:43.981 --> 02:33:45.115
THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO.

02:33:45.182 --> 02:33:46.917
THE DANGER DID THE DANGER AND

02:33:46.984 --> 02:33:48.419
ASKING THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS

02:33:48.485 --> 02:33:50.588
THE PRIORITY BEGS THE HOLISTIC

02:33:50.654 --> 02:33:51.956
APPROACH THAT NEEDS TO OCCUR

02:33:52.022 --> 02:33:53.857
RIGHT OKAY SO --

02:33:53.924 --> 02:33:57.094
SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS.

02:33:57.161 --> 02:33:59.330
DEVELOPING THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE.

02:33:59.396 --> 02:34:01.265
IT'S RELATIVELY LOW COST TO PUT

02:34:01.332 --> 02:34:02.433
THE LAND USE PLANNING

02:34:02.499 --> 02:34:04.134
REQUIREMENTS IN STATURE

02:34:04.201 --> 02:34:06.570
STATUTORY LAW AND CODIFY THEM

02:34:06.637 --> 02:34:09.506
THAT'S A LOW COST SO THAT COULD

02:34:09.573 --> 02:34:11.408
BE DONE LITERALLY THIS SESSION.

02:34:11.475 --> 02:34:15.346
AND THEN APPROACHING THE ONCE

02:34:15.412 --> 02:34:16.880
AGAIN KIND OF EDUCATING THAT

02:34:16.947 --> 02:34:18.115
THOSE PROFESSIONALS OUT THERE SO

02:34:18.182 --> 02:34:19.550
THEY KNOW HOW TO QUICKLY APPLY

02:34:19.617 --> 02:34:20.818
THOSE LAWS.

02:34:20.884 --> 02:34:22.319
AND THEN I WOULD SAY GOING BACK

02:34:22.386 --> 02:34:23.721
TO THIS RETROFIT THE HARDENED

02:34:23.787 --> 02:34:26.190
COMMUNITY OR RESILIENT COMMUNITY

02:34:26.256 --> 02:34:28.359
IS BUILT ON THIS --

02:34:28.425 --> 02:34:30.427
THIS REQUIREMENT THIS NEED THAT

02:34:30.494 --> 02:34:32.229
WE HAVE FOR THE RETROFIT OF BOTH

02:34:32.296 --> 02:34:34.598
THE BUILDING AND THE DEFENSIBLE

02:34:34.665 --> 02:34:36.900
SPACE AND THAT.

02:34:36.967 --> 02:34:38.002
WHICH IS NOT GONNA MAKE MUCH

02:34:38.068 --> 02:34:39.803
PROGRESS ON THE FIRE LOSSES INTO

02:34:39.870 --> 02:34:41.538
WE GO THROUGH.

02:34:41.605 --> 02:34:44.274
THE ENFORCEMENT AND THE ENABLING

02:34:44.341 --> 02:34:45.009
A BOTH RETROFITTING DEFENSIBLE

02:34:45.075 --> 02:34:46.577
SPACE TO JUST HAVE A WARNING

02:34:46.644 --> 02:34:47.645
THESE --

02:34:47.711 --> 02:34:49.013
NICE WAYS OF DOING THINGS WHAT.

02:34:49.079 --> 02:34:50.481
MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK ONE OF

02:34:50.547 --> 02:34:52.216
THINGS WE DISCOVERED IN WHEN I

02:34:52.282 --> 02:34:53.651
WAS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR.

02:34:53.717 --> 02:34:56.954
AND AN AFTERMATH REPORTS ON BIG

02:34:57.021 --> 02:34:58.689
FIRES AND IN THE MOUNTAINS IN

02:34:58.756 --> 02:35:01.759
SANTA CLARA COUNTY WE FOUND THAT --

02:35:01.825 --> 02:35:04.361
OVER 50% OF THE DWELLINGS BURN

02:35:04.428 --> 02:35:05.996
HAD NO BUILDING PERMITS

02:35:06.063 --> 02:35:07.231
WHATSOEVER.

02:35:07.297 --> 02:35:09.299
OKAY SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF

02:35:09.366 --> 02:35:10.768
STRUCTURES THAT ARE.

02:35:10.834 --> 02:35:14.838
NOT PERMITTED AND THAT GOES FOR

02:35:14.905 --> 02:35:16.573
WIRE RINGING --

02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:18.509
THE STRUCTURAL PERMITS OR ANY

02:35:18.575 --> 02:35:19.877
KIND OF PERMITS SAID NO PERMITS

02:35:19.943 --> 02:35:21.745
WHATSOEVER.

02:35:21.812 --> 02:35:24.782
AND THAT IS A PERVASIVE PROBLEM

02:35:24.848 --> 02:35:26.450
ALSO.

02:35:26.517 --> 02:35:29.053
THAT REQUIRES MAYBE A LITTLE

02:35:29.119 --> 02:35:31.155
DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN THE KIND

02:35:31.221 --> 02:35:33.624
OF THE PLANNING --

02:35:33.691 --> 02:35:34.958
PROCESS.

02:35:35.025 --> 02:35:36.794
SOFT --

02:35:36.860 --> 02:35:39.029
SHARKS INSPECTION HARD

02:35:39.096 --> 02:35:40.831
INSPECTION IF WE COULD GO IN AND

02:35:40.898 --> 02:35:42.032
IN MAY BE.

02:35:42.099 --> 02:35:45.502
SCREEN AND REMOVE SOMEHOW

02:35:45.569 --> 02:35:45.803
[inaudible]

02:35:45.869 --> 02:35:49.373
ILLEGAL STRUCTURES AND WIRING.

02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:51.241
THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE A QUICK

02:35:51.308 --> 02:35:52.943
FIX DO YOU DO YOU AGREE WITH THE

02:35:53.010 --> 02:35:56.647
WHAT I'M SAYING.

02:35:56.714 --> 02:35:57.748
I'M NOT SURE I WOULD.

02:35:57.815 --> 02:35:59.116
CALL IT A QUICK FIX JUST BECAUSE

02:35:59.183 --> 02:36:00.751
THAT WOULD REDUCE RISKS AS WHAT

02:36:00.818 --> 02:36:01.552
I'M SAYING.

02:36:01.618 --> 02:36:03.287
BUT OVERALL THE THEN CARE THE

02:36:03.353 --> 02:36:04.855
ILLEGAL STUFF THE AMOUNT OF

02:36:04.922 --> 02:36:06.256
RESISTANCE TO THAT SORT OF QUICK

02:36:06.323 --> 02:36:08.358
FIX WOULD MAKE THE QUICK FIX NOT

02:36:08.425 --> 02:36:09.593
SO QUICK I THINK.

02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:11.261
MY SENSE IS THE MORE THAT WE CAN

02:36:11.328 --> 02:36:13.630
COLLECTIVELY MAKE THIS AN URGENT

02:36:13.697 --> 02:36:14.832
MATTER AND AND ACTUALLY PROVIDE

02:36:14.898 --> 02:36:15.999
THAT WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR

02:36:16.066 --> 02:36:17.735
REGULATIONS AND INCENTIVES FOR

02:36:17.801 --> 02:36:19.703
HARDENING HOMES AND DEALING WITH.

02:36:19.770 --> 02:36:21.238
DEFENSIBLE SPACE TO PROTECT THE

02:36:21.305 --> 02:36:24.608
HOME NOT BEEN BURNED BY THE FIRE

02:36:24.675 --> 02:36:25.676
THAT'S THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE

02:36:25.743 --> 02:36:26.744
BUCK GONE FOR THE NIGHT MY

02:36:26.810 --> 02:36:28.078
APPROACH WOULD BE LIKE IF YOU

02:36:28.145 --> 02:36:30.447
GOT A REALLY.

02:36:30.514 --> 02:36:32.282
SEVERE WRIST AREA.

02:36:32.349 --> 02:36:34.451
AND YOU HAVE SOME.

02:36:34.518 --> 02:36:37.354
BUILDINGS THAT HAD ILLEGAL

02:36:37.421 --> 02:36:38.889
WIRING AND ALL KINDS OF

02:36:38.956 --> 02:36:41.191
HAZARDOUS KIND OF BASICALLY

02:36:41.258 --> 02:36:43.160
HAZARDOUS [inaudible]

02:36:43.227 --> 02:36:44.561
SITUATIONS.

02:36:44.628 --> 02:36:46.997
YOU CAN'T JUST.

02:36:47.064 --> 02:36:49.433
WAIT FOR THAT TO GET BETTER YOU

02:36:49.500 --> 02:36:50.267
HAVE.

02:36:50.334 --> 02:36:51.034
TO RIGHT.

02:36:51.101 --> 02:36:52.202
YOU HAVE TO GO ON DEALWITH A I

02:36:52.269 --> 02:36:53.570
MEAN OTHERWISE YOU'RE JUST

02:36:53.637 --> 02:36:55.305
WAITING FOR AN EXPLOSION TO

02:36:55.372 --> 02:36:56.774
OCCUR BASICALLY.

02:36:56.840 --> 02:36:57.975
I WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK AND

02:36:58.041 --> 02:36:59.042
ADDRESS SENATOR MAGUIRE'S

THE RESPOND ORDERS YOU KNOW THE

02:37:12.356 --> 02:37:14.491
FIREFIGHTING FORCES CRITICAL

02:37:14.558 --> 02:37:18.328
THESE PROVISIONS ARE NOT GOING.

02:37:18.395 --> 02:37:21.365
TO REDUCE THE FIRE IN THE FIRE

02:37:21.431 --> 02:37:23.300
OCCURRENCE ON OUR COMMUNITY ALL

02:37:23.367 --> 02:37:24.768
OF THIS IS DESIGNED THE BUILDING

02:37:24.835 --> 02:37:26.236
THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE

02:37:26.303 --> 02:37:27.371
BUILDING STANDARDS A DEFENSIBLE

02:37:27.437 --> 02:37:27.938
SPACE.

02:37:28.005 --> 02:37:30.073
ARE DESIGNED SO THAT WE REDUCING

02:37:30.140 --> 02:37:31.975
THE NUMBER OF HOUSES THAT ARE

02:37:32.042 --> 02:37:33.310
STARTING TO IGNITE AND

02:37:33.377 --> 02:37:34.745
OVERWHELMING THE FIREFIGHTING

02:37:34.812 --> 02:37:37.414
RESOURCES SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO

02:37:37.481 --> 02:37:37.581
IS.

02:37:37.648 --> 02:37:40.184
IS GET THE FIRE IGNITIONS OF THE

02:37:40.250 --> 02:37:41.718
STRUCTURES DOWN TO A POINT WHERE

02:37:41.785 --> 02:37:43.086
THE FIREFIGHTERS CAN THEN HANDLE

02:37:43.153 --> 02:37:43.954
THOSE.

02:37:44.021 --> 02:37:47.291
AND IT IS THE COMBINATION

02:37:47.357 --> 02:37:49.493
REPARATION IN THE MILITARY TRIMS

02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:50.160
ITS CALLED SHAPING THE

02:37:50.227 --> 02:37:52.462
BATTLEFIELD YOU GET THE THE

02:37:52.529 --> 02:37:53.831
CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND

02:37:53.897 --> 02:37:55.632

02:37:58.802 --> 02:38:00.637
WE'RE NOT GOING TO MITIGATE OUR%

02:38:00.704 --> 02:38:02.673
WAY OUT OF THE RESPONSE

02:38:02.739 --> 02:38:04.975
REQUIREMENT BUT WE CAN MAKE IT

02:38:05.042 --> 02:38:08.846
EASIER FOR THEM TO SUCCEED.

02:39:55.018 --> 02:39:56.753
INPUT THERE AS WELL --

02:39:56.820 --> 02:39:58.255

GOING TO MOVE FORWARD SO --

02:40:00.257 --> 02:40:02.459

02:40:11.134 --> 02:40:12.936
ON OUR HOMES SEEMS TO BE THE

02:40:13.003 --> 02:40:16.139
MOST GRANULAR DETAIL DATA SAID.

KIND OF SHORT CUT TO THAT DATA

02:40:31.621 --> 02:40:33.123

02:46:07.190 --> 02:46:09.726
FRANKLY YES THE IMPACTS OF OF A

02:46:09.793 --> 02:46:10.827
CHANGING CLIMATE WHERE WE'RE

02:46:10.894 --> 02:46:12.195
SEEING OVERALL I MEAN%

02:46:12.262 --> 02:46:13.596
TEMPERATURE INCREASE ACROSS THE

02:46:13.663 --> 02:46:15.065
STATE -- AND

02:46:15.131 --> 02:46:16.266
WE'RE LOOKING AT CHANGES IN

02:46:16.333 --> 02:46:17.500
WEATHER PATTERNS WERE LOOKING AT

02:46:17.567 --> 02:46:19.636
CHANGES IN WHERE VEGETATION

02:46:19.703 --> 02:46:21.571
GROWS WRIST LITERALLY AND REALLY

02:46:21.638 --> 02:46:23.540
AN OVER SIMPLIFIED APPROACH WERE

02:46:23.606 --> 02:46:25.208
SEEING THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:46:25.275 --> 02:46:27.177
FIRE ENVIRONMENT MOVE NORTH.

02:46:27.243 --> 02:46:29.245
IN LATITUDE IN RACING VEGETATION

02:46:29.312 --> 02:46:30.380
MOVE UP.

02:46:30.447 --> 02:46:31.481
IN ELEVATION --

02:46:31.548 --> 02:46:33.049
IN TERMS OF VEGETATION THAT'S

02:46:33.116 --> 02:46:35.051
VERY CONDUCIVE. TO THIS --

02:46:35.118 --> 02:46:39.489
FIRES CYCLE IT'S MORE FREQUENT

02:46:39.556 --> 02:46:40.690
AND MORE DEVASTATING.

02:46:40.757 --> 02:46:41.257
WHAT WE'RE REALLY SEEING IN

02:46:41.324 --> 02:46:41.825
THESE FIRES JUST WE'VE HAD

02:46:41.891 --> 02:46:42.692
DEVASTATING FIRES WE'VE HAD SEEN

02:46:42.759 --> 02:46:44.260
AND WIND DRIVEN WE'VE HAD?

02:46:44.327 --> 02:46:46.029
THE THE OAKLAND HILLS FIRE --

02:46:46.096 --> 02:46:47.931
IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES --

02:46:47.997 --> 02:46:50.367
BUT THE WHAT'S DIFFERENT --

02:46:50.433 --> 02:46:52.402
BURNING WITH JUST INTENSE RATES

02:46:52.469 --> 02:46:54.738
OF SPREAD YOU KNOW FIFTEEN MILES

02:46:54.804 --> 02:46:56.339
IN ONE AFTERNOON FOR ALSO

02:46:56.406 --> 02:46:57.941
LASTING LONGER THEIR BIKES

02:46:58.007 --> 02:47:00.143
POSING FIREFIGHTERS AND THE

02:47:00.210 --> 02:47:02.612
PUBLIC AND COMMUNITIES TO RISK.

02:47:02.679 --> 02:47:03.947
FOR IN THE CASE OF THIS LAST

02:47:04.013 --> 02:47:05.849
SUMMER SIX WEEKS OR MORE WE

02:47:05.915 --> 02:47:06.816
FIGURED THE BETWEEN THE

02:47:06.883 --> 02:47:08.084
MENDOCINO COMPLEX.

02:47:08.151 --> 02:47:09.619
AND THE CAR FIRE BOTH OF THOSE

02:47:09.686 --> 02:47:10.954
FIRES WERE VERY LONG DURATION

02:47:11.020 --> 02:47:12.522
THE THOMAS FIRE.

02:47:12.589 --> 02:47:14.324
IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE

02:47:14.391 --> 02:47:15.792
LONGEST RECORDED RED FLAG

02:47:15.859 --> 02:47:16.726
WARNING.

02:47:16.793 --> 02:47:18.695
THAT I'M AWARE OF THIRTEEN DAYS

02:47:18.762 --> 02:47:20.797
STRAIGHT OF EXTREMELY LOW

02:47:20.864 --> 02:47:23.299
HUMIDITY THESE WIND ARE PRODUCED

02:47:23.366 --> 02:47:25.368
JUST CONDITIONS THAT WERE

02:47:25.435 --> 02:47:27.937
OBVIOUSLY RIGHT. FOR MULTIPLE

02:47:28.004 --> 02:47:29.406
FIRES AND CATASTROPHIC FIRE.

02:47:29.472 --> 02:47:30.774
SO THE CHALLENGE GOING FORWARD

02:47:30.840 --> 02:47:32.175
AND I CERTAINLY YOU KNOW HAVING

02:47:32.242 --> 02:47:33.343
SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING IN

02:47:33.410 --> 02:47:34.511
THE STATE AND BEING PART OF IT

02:47:34.577 --> 02:47:35.879
BUT ALSO WATCHING WHERE THINGS

02:47:35.945 --> 02:47:37.113
ARE GOING --

02:47:37.180 --> 02:47:38.882
AS THE STATE IS RELEASED ITS

02:47:38.948 --> 02:47:40.517
FORTY FIVE DAY REPORT OBVIOUSLY

02:47:40.583 --> 02:47:41.951
VERY AGGRESSIVE LOOK.

02:47:42.018 --> 02:47:43.319
AT THAT SOME VERY TARGETED

02:47:43.386 --> 02:47:45.488
THINGS BUT IT'S THE CAN TO THE

02:47:45.555 --> 02:47:47.290
INVESTMENT THE STATE CONTINUES

02:47:47.357 --> 02:47:48.458
TO MAKE.

02:47:48.525 --> 02:47:51.127
OUR IN THESE KEY AREAS NOW ARE

02:47:51.194 --> 02:47:54.931
AT IS DOCTOR MORRIS SAID THERE

02:47:54.998 --> 02:47:56.065
YOU YOU HAVE THE FORCED.

02:47:56.132 --> 02:47:57.333
WOW MAN ENVIRONMENT AND YOU HAVE

02:47:57.400 --> 02:47:58.134
THIS URBAN FACED ENVIRONMENT

02:47:58.201 --> 02:47:59.969
WHILE THEY ARE CAN BE DISTINCTLY

02:48:00.036 --> 02:48:01.771
SEPARATE I WOULD ARGUE THAT THEY

02:48:01.838 --> 02:48:03.206
WERE OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES ARE

02:48:03.273 --> 02:48:04.507
OFTEN WHERE THEIR OVERLAPPING

02:48:04.574 --> 02:48:05.942
BECAUSE IT ISN'T JUST.

02:48:06.009 --> 02:48:07.677
A COMMUNITY OR SUBDIVISION

02:48:07.744 --> 02:48:08.711
PLOPPED --

02:48:08.778 --> 02:48:10.647
IT IN AN URBAN AREA NEXT TO THE

02:48:10.713 --> 02:48:11.848
WHILE AND WE HAVE COMMUNITIES

02:48:11.915 --> 02:48:14.083
THROUGHOUT.

02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:15.585
THE SIERRA FOOTHILLS OF THAT OUR

02:48:15.652 --> 02:48:18.922
INNER MIX TO THE SO COORDINATING

02:48:18.988 --> 02:48:20.523
THESE ACTIVITIES AND REDUCING

02:48:20.590 --> 02:48:22.592
FUEL LOADINGS USING PRESCRIBED

02:48:22.659 --> 02:48:24.961
FIRE LOSING ALL THESE TOOLS.

02:48:25.028 --> 02:48:26.696
CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON HELPING

02:48:26.763 --> 02:48:28.731
PROTECT COMMUNITIES OR

02:48:28.798 --> 02:48:30.733
STRUCTURES THAT MAY BE WITHIN.

02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:32.402
THE AREA BEING TREATED

02:48:32.469 --> 02:48:34.037
ABSOLUTELY THE WIND DRIVEN FIRES

02:48:34.103 --> 02:48:35.338
THAT WE'RE SEEING --

02:48:35.405 --> 02:48:36.606
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT EIGHTY

02:48:36.673 --> 02:48:38.441
MILE AN HOUR WINDS?

02:48:38.508 --> 02:48:40.310
BLOWING THROUGH CANYONS VERY

02:48:40.376 --> 02:48:41.744
LITTLE CAN BE DONE TO REDUCE

02:48:41.811 --> 02:48:43.179
THAT KIND OF INTENSITY WHEN

02:48:43.246 --> 02:48:44.414
THOSE THINGS ARE OCCURRING AND

02:48:44.481 --> 02:48:46.049
THAT'S WHY.

02:48:46.115 --> 02:48:46.816
EVERYTHING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

02:48:46.883 --> 02:48:47.617
TODAY.

02:48:47.684 --> 02:48:48.885
IT'S SORT OF A WHOLE OF

02:48:48.952 --> 02:48:51.087
COMMUNITY AS YOU HEAR PEOPLE

02:48:51.154 --> 02:48:51.955
TALK ABOUT IT'S THAT IN.

02:48:52.021 --> 02:48:53.223
HOLISTIC APPROACH IT'S ALL OF

02:48:53.289 --> 02:48:55.358
THE ABOVE WE NEED TO BE LOOKING

02:48:55.425 --> 02:48:57.160
AT OBVIOUSLY TREATING VEGETATION

02:48:57.227 --> 02:48:58.561
IN STRATEGIC PLACES AROUND OUR

02:48:58.628 --> 02:48:59.729
COMMUNITIES.

02:48:59.796 --> 02:49:02.065
DEFENSIBLE SPACE ALL OF THAT

02:49:02.131 --> 02:49:03.766
HARDENING THE COMMUNITIES IN AND

02:49:03.833 --> 02:49:04.601
I KNOW THE QUESTIONS GOING TO

02:49:04.667 --> 02:49:05.635
COME LATER ALL DON'T THROW A

02:49:05.702 --> 02:49:06.803
LITTLE BIT OF IT OUT NOW AND WE

02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:07.804
CAN TALK MORE.

02:49:07.871 --> 02:49:09.305
BUT THE IT ALWAYS COMES DOWN TO

02:49:09.372 --> 02:49:10.707
SHOULD WE BE MANDATING OR SHOULD

02:49:10.773 --> 02:49:12.075
WE BE.

02:49:12.141 --> 02:49:13.843
ENCOURAGING THROUGH --

02:49:13.910 --> 02:49:15.411
INCENTIVES AND I I THINK WHAT

02:49:15.478 --> 02:49:16.379
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IS THAT IT'S

02:49:16.446 --> 02:49:18.515
REALLY A COMBINATION OF BOTH AND

02:49:18.581 --> 02:49:21.551
I THINK WHAT WHAT WE'RE FINDING

02:49:21.618 --> 02:49:21.718
IS.

02:49:21.784 --> 02:49:23.386
IS THAT.

02:49:23.453 --> 02:49:25.255
AS OF FIRE MARSHAL MIKE RICH

02:49:25.321 --> 02:49:27.790
WINE TALKED ABOUT THE VERY HIGH

02:49:27.857 --> 02:49:29.125
FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY SOON.

02:49:29.192 --> 02:49:31.094
IDENTIFIED ACROSS THE STATE CAME

02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:32.195
OUT OF THE FIRES --

02:49:32.262 --> 02:49:33.897
YEAR THE OAKLAND HILLS FIRE IN

02:49:33.963 --> 02:49:35.365
THE EARLY NINETIES BECAUSE WHAT

02:49:35.431 --> 02:49:37.700
WE SAW WAS WHILE NGUYEN

02:49:37.767 --> 02:49:39.302
VEGETATION IN AN URBAN AREA.

02:49:39.369 --> 02:49:40.370
ORNAMENTAL VEGETATION AND

02:49:40.436 --> 02:49:41.304
REMEMBER SOT TO PARTNER FOR YOU

02:49:41.371 --> 02:49:44.207
SAW THINGS THAT WERE DRIVING

02:49:44.274 --> 02:49:45.708
FIRE CONDITIONS.

02:49:45.775 --> 02:49:47.410
OUR GREAT LARGE APPROACH TO

02:49:47.477 --> 02:49:49.045
LOOKING IN IDENTIFYING FIRE

02:49:49.112 --> 02:49:50.346
HAZARD BUT WHAT CAN I THINK

02:49:50.413 --> 02:49:51.948
CHIEF JARGON REALLY HIT IT IT'S

02:49:52.015 --> 02:49:53.483
WE NEED TO HAVE THIS DOWN TO THE

02:49:53.550 --> 02:49:56.152
PARCEL LEVEL WE NEED TO BE ABLE.

02:49:56.219 --> 02:49:58.655
TO LOOK AT AN INDIVIDUAL HOUSE

02:49:58.721 --> 02:50:00.123
AN INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT AND

02:50:00.189 --> 02:50:01.457
INITIAL STRUCTURE AND SAY.

02:50:01.524 --> 02:50:04.794
CAN I MITIGATE THE RISK OF FIRE

02:50:04.861 --> 02:50:06.863
LIFE LOSS OF LIFE ON THAT PIECE

02:50:06.930 --> 02:50:07.864
OF PROPERTY.

02:50:07.931 --> 02:50:09.032
BASED ON WHERE I WANT TO PUT

02:50:09.098 --> 02:50:11.668
THAT STRUCTURE LOCATED NEXT TO A

02:50:11.734 --> 02:50:13.336
CANYON THAT THE VEGETATION THE

02:50:13.403 --> 02:50:15.271
PREVAILING WIND PATTERNS ALL OF

02:50:15.338 --> 02:50:17.206
THOSE THINGS INGRESS EGRESS ALL

02:50:17.273 --> 02:50:18.575
THE THINGS YOU FOR TODAY.

02:50:18.641 --> 02:50:19.809
ALL THOSE EVALUATIONS NEED TO

02:50:19.876 --> 02:50:21.377
OCCUR AND IF WE CAN'T GET TO

02:50:21.444 --> 02:50:22.879
THAT PLACE THE NOSE OF THE

02:50:22.946 --> 02:50:24.280
DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT

02:50:24.347 --> 02:50:25.882
ARE HARD ABOUT NOT MAYBE.

02:50:25.949 --> 02:50:28.184
PUTTING A HOME THERE WHAT.

02:50:28.251 --> 02:50:29.519
I DON'T WANT TO BE.

02:50:29.586 --> 02:50:30.753
BUT LITERALLY WATER CORRECT IS

02:50:30.820 --> 02:50:32.188
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS ARTICLE

02:50:32.255 --> 02:50:33.623
THAT QUOTED.

02:50:33.690 --> 02:50:35.024
ME OUT OF CONTEXT SAYING THAT

02:50:35.091 --> 02:50:36.926
THE CHIEF WANTS TO BAN BUILDING

02:50:36.993 --> 02:50:38.561
IN THE WILD MANNER INTERFACE.

02:50:38.628 --> 02:50:39.896
SENATE MCGUIRE SAID I'M BUILDING

02:50:39.963 --> 02:50:41.431
A HOUSE IN THE URBAN INTERFACE I

02:50:41.497 --> 02:50:42.932
KNOW TRUE WELL.

02:50:42.999 --> 02:50:44.300
THE IMPACTS ON THE CHALLENGES

02:50:44.367 --> 02:50:47.036
BUT WE HAVE TO DO IS UNDERSTAND

02:50:47.103 --> 02:50:47.904
THE RISKS.

02:50:47.971 --> 02:50:50.473
MITIGATE THOSE RISKS AND THAT'S

02:50:50.540 --> 02:50:51.040
GONNA BE A COMBINATION OF A

02:50:51.107 --> 02:50:51.941
CARROT.

02:50:52.008 --> 02:50:53.476
AND A STICK AND I THINK THAT'S

02:50:53.543 --> 02:50:54.978
REALLY THE END OF THE DAY WHERE

02:50:55.044 --> 02:50:56.179
WE NEED TO GET --

02:50:56.245 --> 02:50:57.347
TO IS CONTINUING TO HAVE THAT

02:50:57.413 --> 02:50:59.048
DIALOGUE AS TO HOW WE IMPLEMENT

02:50:59.115 --> 02:51:01.217
ALL OF THAT. TO GET TO THAT IN

02:51:01.284 --> 02:51:02.452
STATE AND IT'S THE LEGACY

02:51:02.518 --> 02:51:03.920
CONSTRUCTION THE THE BUILT

02:51:03.987 --> 02:51:05.588
ENVIRONMENT THAT WAS THERE PRIOR.

02:51:05.655 --> 02:51:07.457
TO THE STATE'S VERY AGGRESSIVE

02:51:07.523 --> 02:51:09.425
URBAN INTERFACE BUILDING CODES

02:51:09.492 --> 02:51:10.426
THAT HAS ONLY BEEN IN PLACE FOR

02:51:10.493 --> 02:51:11.728
DECADES IT'S THIS ORDER

02:51:11.794 --> 02:51:13.529
CONSTRUCTION THAT IS YOU'VE ALL

02:51:13.596 --> 02:51:13.863
TALKED ABOUT.

02:51:13.930 --> 02:51:16.566
THIS MORNING IS CONTINUING TO BE

02:51:16.633 --> 02:51:19.969
OUR CHALLENGE IN ONE MINUTE THAT.

02:51:20.036 --> 02:51:20.703
SO WITH THAT I'M GONNA GO AHEAD

02:51:20.770 --> 02:51:22.305
AND SEE TO THE REST OF MY TIME I

02:51:22.372 --> 02:51:23.539
KNOW WE'VE GOT THERE ARE A

02:51:23.606 --> 02:51:24.273
NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:51:24.340 --> 02:51:26.042
QUESTIONS AND WOULD LIKE TO

PEOPLE WITHIN THE TOWN.

02:53:11.447 --> 02:53:13.082
NOT SO MUCH AND THAT'S A THAT'S

02:53:13.149 --> 02:53:14.417
A CHALLENGE --

02:53:14.484 --> 02:53:16.052
MIGHT WERE MY DAUGHTER WAS WHEN

02:53:29.465 --> 02:53:31.501
OF THE CITY --

02:53:31.567 --> 02:53:32.668
LONG BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE IS

02:53:32.735 --> 02:53:34.003
BRING SO WE STARTED BURNING ON

02:53:34.070 --> 02:53:35.738

02:53:49.385 --> 02:53:50.520
THEY COULD TRY TO DO IT THE

02:53:50.586 --> 02:53:53.756
CHALLENGES OF EVACUATIONS YOU'RE

02:53:53.823 --> 02:53:57.293
STUCK IN TRAFFIC. FOR HOURS AND

02:53:57.360 --> 02:53:59.729
THE PROBLEM WASN'T OUR TRAFFIC

02:53:59.796 --> 02:54:01.297
IN THE TOWN OF PARADISE.

02:54:01.364 --> 02:54:02.765
IT WAS DOWN AT THE BOTTOM SKY

02:54:02.832 --> 02:54:05.868
WAY FIFTEEN MILES.

02:54:05.935 --> 02:54:08.671
AWAY AT HIGHWAY NINETY NINE

02:54:08.738 --> 02:54:11.374
WHERE THEY WEREN'T PREPARED FOR

02:54:11.440 --> 02:54:14.243
HAVING. TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY

02:54:14.310 --> 02:54:16.179
THOUSAND VEHICLES SOME ARE MAYOR

02:54:16.245 --> 02:54:18.147
WHO'S A FORGE FORMER CALTRANS

02:54:18.214 --> 02:54:19.582
DISTRICT DIRECTOR KNOWS A BIT

02:54:19.649 --> 02:54:22.118
ABOUT TRAFFIC MOVEMENT SHE SAYS

02:54:22.185 --> 02:54:23.486
THERE'S NO PHYSICAL WAY.

02:54:23.553 --> 02:54:25.188
THAT YOU COULD MOVE THAT MANY

02:54:25.254 --> 02:54:27.356
VEHICLES ON THE SQUARE FOOTAGES

02:54:27.423 --> 02:54:28.825
STREET THAT WE HAVE IN THE

02:54:28.891 --> 02:54:30.359
AMOUNT OF TIME WE HAD.

02:54:30.426 --> 02:54:32.261
THE JUST NO WAY TO DO IT --

02:54:32.328 --> 02:54:33.996
THEY HAVE BEEN ADDED THE UPPER

02:54:34.063 --> 02:54:36.098
REACHES SCAPE ROUTE IN TWO

02:54:36.165 --> 02:54:36.933
THOUSAND EIGHT AFTER THE HUMBLE

02:54:36.999 --> 02:54:40.102
COMPLEX FIRES --

02:54:40.169 --> 02:54:41.537
THAT HELPED A GREAT DEAL.

02:54:41.604 --> 02:54:44.740
BUT WE WE HAD THAT WE USE CONTRA

02:54:44.807 --> 02:54:46.108
FLOW.

02:54:46.175 --> 02:54:48.778
ALL LANES WHAT WAS NORMALLY

GOING OUT OF TOWN BECAME SIX

02:54:52.315 --> 02:54:53.950
LANES GOING OUT OF TOWN.

02:54:54.016 --> 02:54:55.418
BUT YOU WERE HAVING TO DODGE

02:54:55.484 --> 02:54:56.919
FIRST RESPONDERS TRYING TO GET

02:54:56.986 --> 02:54:59.488

THEY DO AN EXCELLENT JOB --

02:55:04.927 --> 02:55:07.330
WE HAD EXCELLENT RESPONSE BUT IT

02:55:07.396 --> 02:55:08.664
WAS -- TRULY

02:55:08.731 --> 02:55:10.466
AB CHALLENGING UP SOME OF THE

02:55:10.533 --> 02:55:13.669
TAKE WASTE JUST QUICKLY --

02:55:13.736 --> 02:55:16.539
AN ADVANCED RAPID WARNING SYSTEM

02:55:16.606 --> 02:55:19.075
IS SOMETHING WE NEED --

02:55:19.141 --> 02:55:21.377
BEEN OUR WE WE COMMUNITIES.

02:55:21.444 --> 02:55:23.679
AND INCIDENTLY ALL THE REBUILD

02:55:23.746 --> 02:55:25.548
IN PARADISE HALF TO MEET WILLIE

02:55:25.615 --> 02:55:27.116
STANDARDS EVERYBODY'S GONNA HAVE

02:55:27.183 --> 02:55:28.384
TO BE SPRINKLER --

02:55:28.451 --> 02:55:30.152
THEY HAVE TO BE THAT NON

02:55:30.219 --> 02:55:31.654
COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS --

02:55:31.721 --> 02:55:33.222
SO THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT

02:55:33.289 --> 02:55:34.757
THAT I VERIFIED THAT THIS

02:55:34.824 --> 02:55:37.226
MORNING WITH THE TOWN MANAGER

02:55:37.293 --> 02:55:39.262
BUT WE NEED TO HAVE MORE --

02:55:39.328 --> 02:55:41.831
AS A DATE THE ADVANCE RAPID

02:55:41.898 --> 02:55:47.236
WARNING SYSTEMS --

02:55:47.303 --> 02:55:48.004
WE HAVE TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE IN

02:55:48.070 --> 02:55:49.138
THE IN THE WET SEASON TO BE ABLE

02:55:49.205 --> 02:55:49.405
TO USE --

02:55:49.472 --> 02:55:50.873
CONTROLLED BURNS ARE PRESCRIBED

02:55:50.940 --> 02:55:52.041
FIRE.

02:55:52.108 --> 02:55:54.677
WITHOUT RUNNING AFOUL OF THE AIR

02:55:54.744 --> 02:55:56.579
QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT'S --

02:55:56.646 --> 02:55:58.281
THAT THE KIND OF CONTROL OUR

02:55:58.347 --> 02:56:00.283
ABILITY TO DO THAT AND AND WE

02:56:00.349 --> 02:56:02.118
NEED TO STAFF CAL FIRE YEAR

02:56:02.184 --> 02:56:03.920
ROUND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR

02:56:03.986 --> 02:56:06.255
TEAMS WORKING ON THAT STUFF

02:56:06.322 --> 02:56:07.690
REALLY NEEDS TO BE A FULL TIME

02:56:07.757 --> 02:56:07.890
THING.

02:56:07.957 --> 02:56:09.525
AND THEN.

02:56:09.592 --> 02:56:10.593
THE OTHER THING WE FOUND IT WE

02:56:10.660 --> 02:56:12.662
NEED TO REALLY LOOK MORE AT IN

02:56:12.728 --> 02:56:14.363
THESE COMMUNITIES.

02:56:14.430 --> 02:56:16.299
IS A BUILDER AT BILL THAT HE TO

02:56:16.365 --> 02:56:18.100
SHELTER IN PLACE --

02:56:18.167 --> 02:56:19.936
CROSS FOR MY MOVIE THEATER TO

02:56:20.002 --> 02:56:22.805
KMART PARKING LOT --

02:56:22.872 --> 02:56:24.240
SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED VEHICLES

02:56:24.307 --> 02:56:26.008
SHELTERED IN PLACE THERE BECAUSE

02:56:26.075 --> 02:56:27.310
THEY COULD NOT GET OUT BECAUSE

02:56:27.376 --> 02:56:29.211
THE TRAFFIC THAT WAS THE SAFEST

02:56:29.278 --> 02:56:30.713
PLACE FOR THEM TO BE.

02:56:30.780 --> 02:56:33.115
CAL FIRE WAS THERE AND THEN WHEN

02:56:33.182 --> 02:56:34.850
IT WAS WHEN THE TRAFFIC IT LET

02:56:34.917 --> 02:56:36.419
UP THEN THEY LET THEM OUT OF

02:56:36.485 --> 02:56:36.819
TOWN.

02:56:36.886 --> 02:56:38.621
AND AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

02:56:38.688 --> 02:56:40.289
NEED TO LOOK AT THAT AND

02:56:40.356 --> 02:56:42.758
IDENTIFY PLACES WHERE --

02:56:42.825 --> 02:56:44.994
THE STRUCTURES ARE SUCH THAT

02:56:45.061 --> 02:56:46.862
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BURN.

02:56:46.929 --> 02:56:47.964
AND AND THAT WE CAN SHELTER RE

02:56:48.030 --> 02:56:51.334
EMPLOYED SURE OFF AND THEN ALLOW

02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:53.002
THE FIRST RESPONDERS TO DO THEIR

02:56:53.069 --> 02:56:54.203
JOB --

02:56:54.270 --> 02:56:55.638
BECAUSE ALL OF THEM THAT ARE IN

02:56:55.705 --> 02:56:58.040
TOWN THAT DAY WERE.

02:56:58.107 --> 02:56:59.542
ONLY WORRIED ABOUT LIFE SAFETY

02:56:59.608 --> 02:57:01.110
GETTING PEOPLE OUT THEY WEREN'T

02:57:01.177 --> 02:57:03.112
FIGHTING THE STRUCTURE FIRES AT

02:57:03.179 --> 02:57:04.380
THAT POINT IT WAS JUST GETTING

02:57:04.447 --> 02:57:05.614
PEOPLE OUT ONE MINUTE.

02:57:05.681 --> 02:57:09.385
OKAY AND THEN LASTLY P. JEANNIE --

02:57:09.452 --> 02:57:11.420
HAS THE IN THEIR IN THEIR

02:57:11.487 --> 02:57:12.989
REBUILD PROCESS --

02:57:13.055 --> 02:57:14.991
IS USING SOMETHING THEY CALL

02:57:15.057 --> 02:57:16.459
TREE RATED WIRING.

02:57:16.525 --> 02:57:18.060
AND I THINK THAT SOMETHING A LOT

02:57:18.127 --> 02:57:19.996
OF THESE FIRES SEEM TO BE

02:57:20.062 --> 02:57:21.497
ATTRIBUTED TO PGA OR THE

02:57:21.564 --> 02:57:24.400
UTILITIES AND AND SOUTHERN

02:57:24.467 --> 02:57:27.503
CALIFORNIA EDISON IS SPENT FIVE

02:57:27.570 --> 02:57:28.137
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PUTTING

02:57:28.204 --> 02:57:28.771
IN.

02:57:28.838 --> 02:57:31.040
TREE RATED WIRING P. JEANNIE HAD

02:57:31.107 --> 02:57:31.707
NOT BEEN DOING THAT THEY'RE

02:57:31.774 --> 02:57:33.342
DOING THAT NOW IN PARADISE BUT

02:57:33.409 --> 02:57:35.411
THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF THAT --

02:57:35.478 --> 02:57:36.712
THAT WIRING.

02:57:36.779 --> 02:57:37.780
AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY

02:57:37.847 --> 02:57:39.548
IMPORTANT AND THEN ALSO THINGS

02:57:39.615 --> 02:57:41.751
LIKE A HIGH IMPEDANCE ARC FAULT

02:57:41.817 --> 02:57:43.119
INTERRUPTERS --

02:57:43.185 --> 02:57:44.854
WHICH CAN STOP THINGS FROM

02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:46.689
SPREADING --

02:57:46.756 --> 02:57:47.256
AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

02:57:47.323 --> 02:57:48.824
BECAUSE LET'S LET'S STOP THE

02:57:48.891 --> 02:57:51.494
IGNITION --

02:57:51.560 --> 02:57:53.229
BUT LOTS OF BUG.

02:57:53.295 --> 02:57:55.164

I HAD FOUR DIFFERENT AREAS I WAS

02:59:30.326 --> 02:59:31.093
GOING TO COMMENT ON THE LEGACY

02:59:31.160 --> 02:59:31.594

HI YOU KNOW. FOR ME THE LONG

02:59:35.531 --> 02:59:37.800
DEAD --

02:59:37.867 --> 02:59:39.335
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA COUNTIES

02:59:39.401 --> 02:59:40.302
IS -- YOU

KNOW THESE FIRE TRAPS ARE

02:59:42.238 --> 02:59:42.805
SERIOUS ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO

02:59:42.872 --> 02:59:44.073
ADDRESS IN OUR LEGACY

02:59:44.140 --> 02:59:46.108
COMMUNITIES.

02:59:46.175 --> 02:59:48.043
YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE NEED

02:59:48.110 --> 02:59:50.713
FOR EVEN COVERS GUTTER COVERS --

02:59:50.779 --> 02:59:53.015
LANDSCAPE REPLACING WOODEN DECKS

02:59:53.082 --> 02:59:54.583
ALREADY THOSE KINDS OF THINGS I

02:59:54.650 --> 02:59:56.051
MY RECOMMENDATION IS LIKE YOU

02:59:56.118 --> 02:59:57.920
FOR BEFORE TO CONTINUE TO WORK

02:59:57.987 --> 02:59:59.989
WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY.

03:00:00.055 --> 03:00:01.290
AND ALSO YOU KNOW WE COULD

03:00:01.357 --> 03:00:02.258
INCORPORATE SOME OF THE

03:00:02.324 --> 03:00:03.726
TECHNOLOGY POSSIBLY IN THE

03:00:03.792 --> 03:00:05.427
FUTURE PROGRAMS WERE PEOPLE DO

03:00:05.494 --> 03:00:06.929
THEIR OWN VIDEO INSPECTIONS OF

03:00:06.996 --> 03:00:08.097
THEIR HOMES --

03:00:08.164 --> 03:00:09.265
THAT GETS FORWARDED ON YOUR

03:00:09.331 --> 03:00:10.699
INSURANCE COMPANY THAT BECOMES

03:00:10.766 --> 03:00:12.501
PART OF YOUR RECORD FOR SHOWING

03:00:12.568 --> 03:00:14.770
YOUR DEFENSIBLE SPACE YOUR YOU

03:00:14.837 --> 03:00:16.105
KNOW YOU'VE MADE IMPROVEMENTS TO

03:00:16.172 --> 03:00:17.640
CATCHER --

03:00:17.706 --> 03:00:19.675
AND GUTTERS COVERED YOU CUT EVEN

03:00:19.742 --> 03:00:20.442
COVERS --

03:00:20.509 --> 03:00:21.443
YOU WEN YOU REPLACE WOOD DECKS

03:00:21.510 --> 03:00:22.611
I MEAN ALL THOSE THINGS COULD BE

03:00:22.678 --> 03:00:23.846
VERIFIED THERE ARE THERE WE GOT

03:00:23.913 --> 03:00:24.880
TO BE THINKING MORE CREATIVELY I

03:00:24.947 --> 03:00:25.748
THINK.

03:00:25.814 --> 03:00:26.382
THEY'RE JUST GOING OUT TO EVERY

03:00:26.448 --> 03:00:27.683
HOUSE AND KNOCKED ON EVERY DOOR

03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:29.185
I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF TOOLS

03:00:29.251 --> 03:00:31.420
TO USE SO LET'S PUT HIM TO USE.

03:00:31.487 --> 03:00:33.322
ANOTHER IDEA WAS TO HAVE

03:00:33.389 --> 03:00:34.990
SOMETHING KIND OF LIKE A A

03:00:35.057 --> 03:00:36.292
NATIONAL FIRE INSURANCE PROGRAM.

03:00:36.358 --> 03:00:37.793
SIMILAR TO NATIONAL FLOOD

03:00:37.860 --> 03:00:39.495
INSURANCE PROGRAM.

03:00:39.562 --> 03:00:40.129
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S BEEN

03:00:40.196 --> 03:00:42.865
TALKED ABOUT BUT I'VE MY FIRE

03:00:42.932 --> 03:00:45.301
FOLKS TELL ME THAT GAINES LIVE

03:00:45.367 --> 03:00:49.205
IN THE WE WE IN THAT PUTS US ON

03:00:49.271 --> 03:00:50.906
THE SCALE I THINK OF OF A FLOOD

03:00:50.973 --> 03:00:52.208
THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE.

03:00:52.274 --> 03:00:53.709
TYPE OF PROGRAM THE OTHER IDEA

03:00:53.776 --> 03:00:55.010
WOULD BE IT'S TAX SEASON.

03:00:55.077 --> 03:00:56.679
NO SIR TAX CREDIT POSSIBILITIES

03:00:56.745 --> 03:00:58.547
SIMILAR LIKE WE DO A SOLAR --

03:00:58.614 --> 03:00:59.114
FOR SOME OF THESE TYPES OF

03:00:59.181 --> 03:01:00.516
IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD BE

03:01:00.583 --> 03:01:03.552
SOMETHING. TO TAKE A LOOK AT

03:01:03.619 --> 03:01:04.520
NEXT THERE IS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

03:01:04.587 --> 03:01:05.521
IN FIRE PRONE AREAS [inaudible]

03:01:05.588 --> 03:01:07.389
I AM.

03:01:07.456 --> 03:01:08.424
YOU KNOW THIS THIS FIRE THAT WE

03:01:08.490 --> 03:01:09.959
HAD THIS THIS WAS A WILDLAND

03:01:10.025 --> 03:01:10.826
FIRE.

03:01:10.893 --> 03:01:12.561
THAT BECAME AN URBAN FIRE AND I

03:01:12.628 --> 03:01:13.629
THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING

03:01:13.696 --> 03:01:15.598
WITH HIS COFFEE PARKER PARADISE

03:01:15.664 --> 03:01:16.532
IN THE COUNTY.

03:01:16.599 --> 03:01:18.167
I YOU KNOW YOU HEARD THE EMBERS

03:01:18.234 --> 03:01:20.269
JUMPING FIVE MILES IF YOU LOOK

03:01:20.336 --> 03:01:21.437
AT THE PROGRESSION MAP OF THE

03:01:21.503 --> 03:01:22.905
FIRE WRITTEN IN RAM PARADISE

03:01:22.972 --> 03:01:24.640
IT'S SWALLOWED PARADISE FROM

03:01:24.707 --> 03:01:25.608
BOTH SIDES.

03:01:25.674 --> 03:01:27.076
AND IT WAS THE SCARIEST THING

03:01:27.142 --> 03:01:29.111
THING TO LOOK AT IN THE

03:01:29.178 --> 03:01:30.646
PROGRESSION --

03:01:30.713 --> 03:01:32.748
BUT THESE ARE ANGRY FIRES AND IT

03:01:32.815 --> 03:01:34.016
TAKES IT'S GOING TO TAKE

03:01:34.083 --> 03:01:35.551
EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE BEEN

03:01:35.618 --> 03:01:36.785
TALKING ABOUT I'M SURE AND MORE.

03:01:36.852 --> 03:01:38.621
AND I DON'T KNOW THE WE CAN STOP

03:01:38.687 --> 03:01:38.921
THE FIRES --

03:01:38.988 --> 03:01:41.123
I THINK YOU DO WHEN THE FIRE

03:01:41.190 --> 03:01:42.925
COMES.

03:01:42.992 --> 03:01:44.560
THAT'S A SOBERING THOUGHT TO

03:01:44.627 --> 03:01:46.428
THINK ABOUT.

03:01:46.495 --> 03:01:47.963
I KNOW THIS FIRE I HAD A VERY --

03:01:48.030 --> 03:01:49.531
POINT COUNTERPOINT CONVERSATIONS

03:01:49.598 --> 03:01:51.100
WHEN MY FIREMAN I SAID WHY DID

03:01:51.166 --> 03:01:52.701
YOU GUYS JUST NOT THIS DOWN FROM

03:01:52.768 --> 03:01:54.370
THE AIR RIGHT WHEN IT HAPPENED.

03:01:54.436 --> 03:01:56.005
AND YET SIX THREE MORNING.

03:01:56.071 --> 03:01:57.840
SAID THE WINDS WERE SO HIGH THE

03:01:57.906 --> 03:01:59.708
SMOKE WAS SO THICK THEY COULD

03:01:59.775 --> 03:02:01.277
NOT GET IN THERE.

03:02:01.343 --> 03:02:02.678
AND YOU KNOW THAT WAS WELL DON'T

03:02:02.745 --> 03:02:05.147
YOU HAVE A SUPER DUPER PLAYING

03:02:05.214 --> 03:02:06.115
THE CAN GET AND YOU KNOW HIM.

03:02:06.181 --> 03:02:06.782
SO ANYWAY --

03:02:06.849 --> 03:02:08.784
IT WAS VERY FRUSTRATING BUT THE

03:02:08.851 --> 03:02:09.351
REAL.

03:02:09.418 --> 03:02:10.552
OF THE FIRST TEN HOURS OF THE

03:02:10.619 --> 03:02:11.553
EMERGENCY RESPONSE WAS

03:02:11.620 --> 03:02:13.055
ESSENTIALLY A LIFE RESCUE EVENT

03:02:13.122 --> 03:02:14.590
ALSO I THINK THERE'S A LOSING

03:02:14.657 --> 03:02:15.991
THAT THE THEY'RE FIGHTING THE

03:02:16.058 --> 03:02:16.659
FIRE THERE ARE FIGHTING THE FIRE

03:02:16.725 --> 03:02:18.193
THEIR THIEVING FIFTY THOUSAND

03:02:18.260 --> 03:02:19.194
PEOPLE'S LIVES.

03:02:19.261 --> 03:02:20.262
THAT'S WHAT WAS GOING ON FOR THE

03:02:20.329 --> 03:02:23.565
FIRST TEN HOURS IN PARADISE IN

03:02:23.632 --> 03:02:25.301
IN THE COUNTY.

03:02:25.367 --> 03:02:26.969
A PARADISE I HAD A CONVERSATION

03:02:27.036 --> 03:02:28.137
WITH THE TOWN MANAGER ALSO AND

03:02:28.203 --> 03:02:29.438
WHEN.

03:02:29.505 --> 03:02:30.572
THINGS PRETTY BROAD STILL IN IN

03:02:30.639 --> 03:02:32.408
OUR AREA BUT I I ASK A QUESTION

03:02:32.474 --> 03:02:34.443
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO ARE YOU GONNA

03:02:34.510 --> 03:02:35.844
REPLANT OR JUST REBUILD.

03:02:35.911 --> 03:02:38.247
AND THE INSTINCT TO THE IN LOVE

03:02:38.314 --> 03:02:39.948
WITH IS TO REBUILD.

03:02:40.015 --> 03:02:40.816
GET IN THE PEOPLE GET BACK ON

03:02:40.883 --> 03:02:41.717
THE PROPERTY YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA

03:02:41.784 --> 03:02:42.985
TAKE AS A YEAR MORE TO CLEAN UP

03:02:43.052 --> 03:02:44.887
THE PROPERTIES.

03:02:44.953 --> 03:02:47.423
SO NOW TO THEIR CREDIT THE TOWN

03:02:47.489 --> 03:02:49.758
IS UNDERTAKING A PROCESS CALLED

03:02:49.825 --> 03:02:51.226
MAKE IT PARADISE.

03:02:51.293 --> 03:02:52.194
ADULT.

03:02:52.261 --> 03:02:52.961
IN THAT CITY COMMUNITY

03:02:53.028 --> 03:02:55.064
ENGAGEMENT PROCESS TO LOOK TO RE

03:02:55.130 --> 03:02:56.031
PLAN.

03:02:56.098 --> 03:02:57.266
ARE THE TOWN IN MAKING A FIRE

03:02:57.333 --> 03:03:00.235
RESILIENT CAM SERVED UP TO YOU

03:03:00.302 --> 03:03:01.537
AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THE TARA

03:03:01.603 --> 03:03:03.772
PARADISE BECOME THE MODEL FIRE

03:03:03.839 --> 03:03:05.374
RESILIENT COMMUNITY.

03:03:05.441 --> 03:03:07.242
SO THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING I

03:03:07.309 --> 03:03:08.210
THINK IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

03:03:08.277 --> 03:03:09.912
UP YOU CARRY RECOVERS DOT ORG IS

03:03:09.978 --> 03:03:11.380
ALSO WEBSITE THAT'S GOT A LOT OF

03:03:11.447 --> 03:03:13.816
GREAT INFORMATION. ONE MINUTE

03:03:13.882 --> 03:03:15.417
OKAY.

03:03:15.484 --> 03:03:15.951
I GOTTA GET INTO LAND USE

03:03:16.018 --> 03:03:16.819
PLANNING LAWS --

03:03:16.885 --> 03:03:18.520
SB TWELVE FORTY ONE WE TALKED

03:03:18.587 --> 03:03:20.856
ABOUT A LITTLE EARLIER IN UNDER

03:03:20.923 --> 03:03:22.291
SB THREE SEVENTY NINE ALSO WE

03:03:22.358 --> 03:03:23.325
HAVE --

03:03:23.392 --> 03:03:24.727
REQUIREMENTS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE

03:03:24.793 --> 03:03:26.662
VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS AN

03:03:26.729 --> 03:03:27.830
ADAPTATION STRATEGIES.

03:03:27.896 --> 03:03:29.498
ALSO THE LOCAL HAS MITIGATION

03:03:29.565 --> 03:03:30.833
PLANS A CONNECTION WITH THE

03:03:30.899 --> 03:03:32.167
SAFETY ON THE TO THE BOTTOM LINE

03:03:32.234 --> 03:03:33.569
THERE IS THAT WE NEED TO CONNECT.

03:03:33.635 --> 03:03:34.670
WITH OUR SAFETY ELEMENTS ARE

03:03:34.737 --> 03:03:36.372
GENERAL PLANTS AND GET SOME REAL

03:03:36.438 --> 03:03:37.806
ACTION ITEMS OUT OF OUR GENERAL

03:03:37.873 --> 03:03:39.708
PLANTS THAT GET SPECIFIC WITH

03:03:39.775 --> 03:03:41.310
WHAT THE TARGETED ISSUES ARE IN

03:03:41.377 --> 03:03:42.378
OUR JURISDICTIONS.

03:03:42.444 --> 03:03:43.879
IN I THINK THE REALITY TO DO

03:03:43.946 --> 03:03:45.080
THAT IS WE NEED SOME FUNDING

03:03:45.147 --> 03:03:46.048
NEED SOME GRANT FUNDING TO MAKE

03:03:46.115 --> 03:03:46.782
THAT HAPPEN.

03:03:46.849 --> 03:03:48.183
SO CONNECTING LH MPS GENERAL

03:03:48.250 --> 03:03:50.719
PLANS SB.

03:03:50.786 --> 03:03:51.620
THREE SEVENTY NINE AND FRANKLY

03:03:51.687 --> 03:03:52.621
WE PROBABLY OUGHT TO THROW IN

03:03:52.688 --> 03:03:54.223
THE U. S. B. ONE THOUSAND

03:03:54.289 --> 03:03:55.357
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE WHILE

03:03:55.424 --> 03:03:56.558
READY BECAUSE WE GOT TO DO THAT

03:03:56.625 --> 03:03:57.526
ANYWAY WOULD WORK.

03:03:57.593 --> 03:04:00.729
ADJUSTING ARSENAL PLANS AND GET

03:04:00.796 --> 03:04:02.398
THAT ALL FIXED.

03:04:02.464 --> 03:04:03.532
I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T

03:04:03.599 --> 03:04:04.566
MENTION SEQUEL.

03:04:04.633 --> 03:04:05.934
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THAT BROUGHT

03:04:06.001 --> 03:04:06.769
UP WHAT'S TODAY I'M SHOCKED --

03:04:06.835 --> 03:04:08.771
BUT A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR SEQUEL

03:04:08.837 --> 03:04:11.340
COULD BE SO ACTUALLY IT'S FIRE

03:04:11.407 --> 03:04:12.374
SAFE COUNCILS ARE IN A VERY

03:04:12.441 --> 03:04:14.710
DIFFICULT POSITION --

03:04:14.777 --> 03:04:15.344
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH

03:04:15.411 --> 03:04:17.112

03:10:06.261 --> 03:10:07.562
OUR PROBLEM DOWN INTO TRYING TO

03:10:07.629 --> 03:10:09.064
DEVELOP INITIATIVES INTO PRE

03:10:09.131 --> 03:10:10.365
EVENT AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

03:10:10.432 --> 03:10:11.500
IDENTIFYING THE PROPERTIES ARE

03:10:11.566 --> 03:10:13.335
RISK ITS MASTER PLANNING A

03:10:13.401 --> 03:10:14.035
GENERAL PLANNING.

03:10:14.102 --> 03:10:15.470
OF COMMUNITIES AND REALLY

03:10:15.537 --> 03:10:17.139
FOCUSING ON THAT THAT

03:10:17.205 --> 03:10:18.807
PREPARATION PIECES MAKING SURE

03:10:18.874 --> 03:10:20.442
EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS

03:10:20.509 --> 03:10:21.977
ARE IN PLACE IS MAKING SURE.

03:10:22.043 --> 03:10:23.478
YOU KNOW FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND

03:10:23.545 --> 03:10:24.045
COMMUNITIES ARE WHERE IT'S

03:10:24.112 --> 03:10:27.015
MAKING SURE THAT DESK I WEIGH IN

03:10:27.082 --> 03:10:29.117
NINETY NINE CAN HANDLE THE THE

03:10:29.184 --> 03:10:30.952
THE TRAFFIC OF WE HAVE TO

03:10:31.019 --> 03:10:32.654
EVACUATE THE TOWN OF PARADISE.

03:10:32.721 --> 03:10:33.889
IS C. EVENT ITSELF IN THE

03:10:33.955 --> 03:10:36.191
ABILITY TO MOBILIZE WHICH WE DO

03:10:36.258 --> 03:10:38.126
A VERY GOOD JOB OF CALIFORNIA IS

03:10:38.193 --> 03:10:39.761
ABLE TO MOVE MORE RESOURCES IN A

03:10:39.828 --> 03:10:40.428
SHORTER.

03:10:40.495 --> 03:10:41.997
TIME THAN ANY PLACE ELSE IN THE

03:10:42.063 --> 03:10:43.832
WORLD BUT THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM

03:10:43.899 --> 03:10:45.000
FOR IMPROVEMENT.

03:10:45.066 --> 03:10:46.535
THEN THE POST EVENT PIECE WHICH

03:10:46.601 --> 03:10:47.936
IS REALLY INTERESTING FACTOR

03:10:48.003 --> 03:10:48.837
TALKING ABOUT THE TOWN OF

03:10:48.904 --> 03:10:50.172
PARADISE IS THAT.

03:10:50.238 --> 03:10:51.840
IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO PLAN

03:10:51.907 --> 03:10:53.375
AHEAD IF WE HAVE AN EVENT LET'S

03:10:53.441 --> 03:10:55.143
NOT DO WHAT WE DID BEFORE

03:10:55.210 --> 03:10:56.444
BECAUSE WE KNOW THE OUTCOME BUT

03:10:56.511 --> 03:10:57.379
LEARN FROM.

03:10:57.445 --> 03:11:00.849
THOSE EXPERIENCES TO CONTINUE TO

03:11:00.916 --> 03:11:05.153
BUILD WHICH IS HOW TO CREATION

03:11:05.220 --> 03:11:06.121
TO THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND

03:11:06.188 --> 03:11:07.422
FIREFIGHTERS WEEK IN ORDER ARMS

03:11:07.489 --> 03:11:08.790
ARE SMART PHONES.

03:11:08.857 --> 03:11:09.558
THE LITTLE THING YOU CARE IN

03:11:09.624 --> 03:11:10.625
YOUR POCKET AS MORE COMPUTING

03:11:10.692 --> 03:11:12.194
POWER THAN WHAT WE PUT MEN ON

03:11:12.260 --> 03:11:13.161
THE MOON WITH.

03:11:13.228 --> 03:11:14.796
AND YET THEY'RE STILL TECHNOLOGY

03:11:14.863 --> 03:11:15.630
THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE

03:11:15.697 --> 03:11:17.098
AVAILABLE TO US THAT WE'RE STILL

03:11:17.165 --> 03:11:19.167
TROUBLING TO TRY TO GET THERE --

03:11:19.234 --> 03:11:20.535
AND THEN THE LAST IS PARTNERING

03:11:20.602 --> 03:11:22.137
WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY

03:11:22.204 --> 03:11:23.572
THEIR LOSSES ARE LOST AS A

03:11:23.638 --> 03:11:25.073
COMMUNITY LOS WERE REALLY ALL IN

03:11:25.140 --> 03:11:27.008

OVER TWO THOUSAND MEMBERS.

03:12:50.492 --> 03:12:52.327
AS THE MEN AND WOMEN ARE SENT

03:12:52.394 --> 03:12:54.629
OUT ABOUT OUT TO BATTLE WITH

03:12:54.696 --> 03:12:56.498
WILDLAND FIRES TODAY.

03:12:56.564 --> 03:12:57.399
THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT

03:12:57.465 --> 03:12:59.434
CREATE HIGH RISK [inaudible]

03:12:59.501 --> 03:13:01.603
CATASTROPHIC FIRES.

03:13:01.670 --> 03:13:03.505
IN THE AFTERMATH OF EVERY MAJOR

03:13:03.571 --> 03:13:05.273
FIRE WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND

03:13:05.340 --> 03:13:07.008
ATTENTION ON SMALL FIXES THAT

03:13:07.075 --> 03:13:08.343
FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY

03:13:08.410 --> 03:13:09.844
OWNERS.

03:13:09.911 --> 03:13:12.714
BILL MATERIALS DEFENSIBLE SPACE.

03:13:12.781 --> 03:13:15.083
PROPER EGRESS TEMPORARY REFUGE

03:13:15.150 --> 03:13:16.952
AND SO FORTH.

03:13:17.018 --> 03:13:18.687
WELL THESE ARE CRITICAL AND

03:13:18.753 --> 03:13:20.422
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS.

03:13:20.488 --> 03:13:22.891
RE RICH WE RISK OVER ENGINEERING

03:13:22.958 --> 03:13:24.359
THINGS.

03:13:24.426 --> 03:13:26.194
IF WE DON'T LOOK AT ALL THE

03:13:26.261 --> 03:13:28.029
FACTORS IN RISK FACTORS.

03:13:28.096 --> 03:13:30.298
THOSE REQS INCLUDE A NUMBER OF

03:13:30.365 --> 03:13:32.934
RESIDENTS IN AN AREA THE

03:13:33.001 --> 03:13:34.035
INFRASTRUCTURE.

03:13:34.102 --> 03:13:37.105
FUEL LOADS PREVIOUS FIRE HISTORY

03:13:37.172 --> 03:13:39.474
AND WEATHER EVENTS.

03:13:39.541 --> 03:13:41.443
THESE MORE EXPANSIVE RICK'S RISK

03:13:41.509 --> 03:13:44.112
FACTORS CAN'T BE VIEWED AS

03:13:44.179 --> 03:13:46.147
STRICTLY LOCAL ISSUES.

03:13:46.214 --> 03:13:49.084
THE IMPACT OF CATASTROPHIC FIRED

03:13:49.150 --> 03:13:50.785
TOUCHES EVERY CALIFORNIA.

03:13:50.852 --> 03:13:52.754
THESE COST OF THESE DISASTERS

03:13:52.821 --> 03:13:55.957
ARE LARGELY BORNE BY ALL OF US.

03:13:56.024 --> 03:13:58.460
IN THE NEW NORMAL AS THEY SAY.

03:13:58.526 --> 03:14:00.562
CALIFORNIA MUST DO MORE TO MAKE

03:14:00.628 --> 03:14:02.430
SURE THE LAND USE POLICY.

03:14:02.497 --> 03:14:03.365
TAKE THESE RISK FACTORS INTO

03:14:03.431 --> 03:14:04.866
ACCOUNT.

03:14:04.933 --> 03:14:06.601
IS IT IT IS.

03:14:06.668 --> 03:14:08.403
WITHOUT SAYING THAT WE SHOULD BE

03:14:08.470 --> 03:14:09.771
LOOKING CLOSELY AT NEW

03:14:09.838 --> 03:14:11.172
DEVELOPMENT IN THE WILDLAND

03:14:11.239 --> 03:14:12.674
URBAN INTERFACE AND OTHER RISK

03:14:12.741 --> 03:14:15.410
AREAS.

03:14:15.477 --> 03:14:16.711
BUT WE MUST ALSO LOOK

03:14:16.778 --> 03:14:18.980
EXTENSIVELY AT THE DEVELOPMENT

03:14:19.047 --> 03:14:19.848
THAT HAS BEEN BUILT OVER THE

03:14:19.914 --> 03:14:24.486
YEARS WITHOUT INTERVENTION.

03:14:24.552 --> 03:14:26.221
WHILE THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THE

03:14:26.287 --> 03:14:28.356
FIRE IMPAIRED US PARADISE WAS

03:14:28.423 --> 03:14:30.358
BEYOND MEASURE WE KNOW THAT THE

03:14:30.425 --> 03:14:31.826
TOWN WAS DEVELOPED HALF A

03:14:31.893 --> 03:14:33.261
CENTURY AGO WITH.

03:14:33.328 --> 03:14:34.763
PERSPECTIVES THAT ARE MUCH

03:14:34.829 --> 03:14:37.065
DIFFERENT TODAY.

03:14:37.132 --> 03:14:39.067
AS WE ASK THE QUESTION.

03:14:39.134 --> 03:14:41.069
SHOULD WE BUILD IT BACK.

03:14:41.136 --> 03:14:42.237
WE HAVE TO LOOK BEYOND LOCAL

03:14:42.303 --> 03:14:43.371
ZONING AND CONSIDER THE BIG

03:14:43.438 --> 03:14:45.173
PICTURE.

03:14:45.240 --> 03:14:46.775
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT FUEL LOADING

03:14:46.841 --> 03:14:49.310
LOCATION ROADS IN AND OUT.

03:14:49.377 --> 03:14:51.212
IGNITION SOURCES AND OTHER

03:14:51.279 --> 03:14:53.248
CASUAL FACTORS.

03:14:53.314 --> 03:14:55.316
ONLY THEN CAN WE DECIDE.

03:14:55.383 --> 03:14:56.951
ON THESE ISSUES SUCH AS SPACING

03:14:57.018 --> 03:14:58.920
ROSE AND STRUCTURAL COMPOSITION

03:14:58.987 --> 03:14:59.988
AND NEW CONSTRUCTION.

03:15:00.055 --> 03:15:01.923
OF COURSE.

03:15:01.990 --> 03:15:03.291
NO ONE SAID PRESCRIPTIONS IS

03:15:03.358 --> 03:15:05.226
FULL PROOF.

03:15:05.293 --> 03:15:06.461
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SANTA ROSA

03:15:06.528 --> 03:15:09.731
FIRE IN.

03:15:09.798 --> 03:15:10.331
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE HAD

03:15:10.398 --> 03:15:12.467
WIDE ROADS PLENTY V. GRESS.

03:15:12.534 --> 03:15:14.135
ANY MANY CASON VERY MODERN

03:15:14.202 --> 03:15:17.439
MATERIALS.

03:15:17.505 --> 03:15:19.240
BUT NO AMOUNT OF PREPARATION OR

03:15:19.307 --> 03:15:21.042
FIRE RESPONSE WAS GOING TO STOP

03:15:21.109 --> 03:15:22.477
THAT FIRE SWARMING THOSE

03:15:22.544 --> 03:15:24.412
NEIGHBORHOODS.

03:15:24.479 --> 03:15:26.014
EVEN HERE THESE EXPERIENCE

03:15:26.081 --> 03:15:28.149
SHOULD OFFER A ROADMAP AS WE

03:15:28.216 --> 03:15:30.251
LOOK TO REBUILD.

03:15:30.318 --> 03:15:32.187
AS THE STATE AS TO THE STATE'S

03:15:32.253 --> 03:15:34.189
ROLE THE FIRST AND FOREMOST

03:15:34.255 --> 03:15:36.224
REQUIRES A REALISTIC AND MORE

03:15:36.291 --> 03:15:38.026
CURRENT ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK

03:15:38.093 --> 03:15:39.094
OF THE STATE AND ALL THE

03:15:39.160 --> 03:15:40.228
COMMUNITIES.

03:15:40.295 --> 03:15:42.630
HAVE WE'VE HEARD CAL FIRES MAPS

03:15:42.697 --> 03:15:44.165
ARE UNDERGOING A REVISION.

03:15:44.232 --> 03:15:45.366
BUT EVEN WHEN THESE MAPS ARE

03:15:45.433 --> 03:15:47.235
CURRIED CAL FIRE IS ONLY

03:15:47.302 --> 03:15:48.937
REQUIRED TO PUBLISH THE DATA ON

03:15:49.003 --> 03:15:50.038
VERY HIGH.

03:15:50.105 --> 03:15:53.775
FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY AREAS.

03:15:53.842 --> 03:15:56.277
WHEN YOU OVER IDENTIFY PEOPLE

03:15:56.344 --> 03:15:57.545
BECOME NUMB TO THE RISK?

03:15:57.612 --> 03:15:59.714
IN OTHER AREAS.

03:15:59.781 --> 03:16:00.648
LIKE HIGH --

03:16:00.715 --> 03:16:02.484
MODERATE FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY

03:16:02.550 --> 03:16:04.752
ZONES.

03:16:04.819 --> 03:16:06.955
CURRENT LAW REQUIRES LOCAL

03:16:07.021 --> 03:16:08.156
GOVERNMENTS TO ADOPT THE COW

03:16:08.223 --> 03:16:11.359
FIRE MAP.

03:16:11.426 --> 03:16:13.561
BUT IN MANY CASES LOCALS LRA

03:16:13.628 --> 03:16:15.964
LOCAL AREAS DO NOT COMPLY INTENT

03:16:16.030 --> 03:16:17.165
PENALTIES ARE NOT SAID

03:16:17.232 --> 03:16:19.067
SIGNIFICANT.

03:16:19.134 --> 03:16:21.970
THESE LAWS NEED MORE TEETH. ONE

03:16:22.036 --> 03:16:24.706
EXAMPLE IS SB THREE SEVENTY NINE

03:16:24.772 --> 03:16:26.508
FROM TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHICH

03:16:26.574 --> 03:16:28.476
REQUIRES LOCAL AGENCIES PROVIDE

03:16:28.543 --> 03:16:30.478
LONG TERM HAZARD MITIGATION SO

03:16:30.545 --> 03:16:33.581
PLANS BY.

03:16:33.648 --> 03:16:34.482
TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO AGENCIES

03:16:34.549 --> 03:16:38.186
THAT DON'T COMPLY WITH ESPYS

03:16:38.253 --> 03:16:38.786
THREE SEVENTY NINE MAY NOT BE

03:16:38.853 --> 03:16:40.855
ELIGIBLE FOR FEMA AID IN THE

03:16:40.922 --> 03:16:42.857
EVENT OF A CATASTROPHIC FIRE OR

03:16:42.924 --> 03:16:45.393
DISASTER.

03:16:45.460 --> 03:16:46.761
WE ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE

03:16:46.828 --> 03:16:48.930
MASSIVE FIRES IN DISASTERS ON A

03:16:48.997 --> 03:16:50.532
REGULAR BASIS.

03:16:50.598 --> 03:16:52.700
BUT THE IMPACT OF CATASTROPHIC

03:16:52.767 --> 03:16:54.369
FIRE STRETCHES WELL BEYOND ONE

03:16:54.435 --> 03:16:56.504
SET OF BORDERS.

03:16:56.571 --> 03:16:59.574
AND THE STATE NEEDS. TO TAKE A

03:16:59.641 --> 03:17:00.875
BROADER VIEW AS WELL.

03:17:00.942 --> 03:17:02.810
WE CAN'T CONTROL MOTHER NATURE

03:17:02.877 --> 03:17:03.845
BUT WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB

03:17:03.912 --> 03:17:05.613
DECIDING WHERE AND HOW TO PUT

03:17:05.680 --> 03:17:09.851
PEOPLE IN THE PATH TO DISASTER.

03:17:09.918 --> 03:17:11.219
I THINK I HAVE A UNIQUE

03:17:11.286 --> 03:17:13.655
PERSPECTIVE ON THE FIRES IN

03:17:13.721 --> 03:17:16.357
CALIFORNIA I STARTED WITH THE

03:17:16.424 --> 03:17:16.958
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WORKING ON

03:17:17.025 --> 03:17:17.792
HAND TRUTH.

03:17:17.859 --> 03:17:19.093
ON THE STANISLAUS NATIONAL

03:17:19.160 --> 03:17:22.030
FOREST I ALSO WORKED. FOR CAL

03:17:22.096 --> 03:17:24.999
FIRE FURTHER ADD THREE YEARS.

03:17:25.066 --> 03:17:26.134
BEFORE I BECAME A FIREFIGHTER

03:17:26.201 --> 03:17:27.402
WITH METRO FIRE [inaudible]

03:17:27.468 --> 03:17:30.939

STRIKE TEAMS.

03:17:40.081 --> 03:17:42.483
ON THE WHICH FIRE.

03:17:42.550 --> 03:17:44.686

03:17:44.752 --> 03:17:46.921
FIREFIGHTERS AND I CAME BACK.

03:17:46.988 --> 03:17:48.623
THAT THIS WAS A CAREER FIRE AND

03:17:48.690 --> 03:17:50.258
I KNOW THAT SOMEONE IS SPOKE ON

03:17:50.325 --> 03:17:52.360
THAT EARLIER.

03:17:52.427 --> 03:17:54.495

03:20:28.182 --> 03:20:29.851
CAN SAY THAT IT IS IT IS

03:20:29.917 --> 03:20:32.487
REQUIRED THAT YOU HAVE TO

03:20:33.855 --> 03:20:35.289
STANDARDS UNDER THE WE SET AN

03:20:35.356 --> 03:20:37.291
MISTER SNOWING SAME SAME THING

03:20:37.358 --> 03:20:38.960
THERE IS THOUGH A MOVE AFOOT.

IN SOME OTHER JURISDICTIONS TO

03:20:41.396 --> 03:20:42.897
USE OF PREVIOUS BUILDING CODE IN

03:20:42.964 --> 03:20:43.798
THAT CONVERSATION CAN BE

03:20:43.865 --> 03:20:46.134
HAPPENING SO UNLESS SOMETHING

03:20:46.200 --> 03:20:47.535
EXTRAORDINARY HAPPENS.

03:20:47.602 --> 03:20:51.773
WE WOULD REBUILD TO THE NEW COAT.

03:20:51.839 --> 03:20:52.874
UNDER EIGHT UNDER A COUNTY

03:20:52.940 --> 03:20:54.275
ORDINANCE OR UNDERSELL

03:20:54.342 --> 03:20:54.909
UNDERSTATES Là UNDERSTATE LAW

03:20:54.976 --> 03:20:55.710
AND IT.

03:20:55.777 --> 03:20:57.044
BUT WE ADOPT THE STATE LAW

03:20:57.111 --> 03:20:59.213
LOCALLY YOU ADOPT THAT WILL BE

03:20:59.280 --> 03:21:01.115

03:21:03.885 --> 03:21:05.887
INTO YOUR BUILDING CODE.

03:21:05.953 --> 03:21:07.522
SO CAN YOU IS THERE A WAY TO GET

03:21:07.588 --> 03:21:08.156
OUT OF IT I MEAN YOU'RE SAYING

03:21:08.222 --> 03:21:08.956
THERE'S A MOVEMENT OF MINIMUM

03:21:09.023 --> 03:21:10.825
STANDARDS UNLESS OR SOME

03:21:10.892 --> 03:21:11.426
LEGISLATIVE RELIEF [inaudible]

03:21:11.492 --> 03:21:14.962
UNDERSTOOD --

03:21:15.029 --> 03:21:17.398
CAN I INTERJECT HERE PLAY A JOB

03:21:17.465 --> 03:21:18.299
JUST RECEIVED SOMETHING THAT

03:21:18.366 --> 03:21:19.434
YESTERDAY OR DAY BEFORE FROM

03:21:19.500 --> 03:21:20.935
SHASTA COUNTY AND THEY HAD

03:21:21.002 --> 03:21:23.104
ROLLED THEIR BUILDING CODES

03:21:23.171 --> 03:21:25.606
AFTER THE CAR FIRE BACK.

03:21:25.673 --> 03:21:26.574
TO THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN

03:21:26.641 --> 03:21:28.342
STANDARDS BUT THEN ADDED IN THAT

03:21:28.409 --> 03:21:32.346
YOU STILL NEED TO MEET WE WE AND

03:21:32.413 --> 03:21:34.315
AND FIRE SPRINKLERS IN THE NON

03:21:34.382 --> 03:21:35.249
COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS.

03:21:35.316 --> 03:21:38.319
SO I PRESUME THAT WAS TO SAVE

03:21:38.386 --> 03:21:41.722
PEOPLE MONEY IN TERMS OF

03:21:41.789 --> 03:21:44.292
ENERGIES ENERGY CALC BECAUSE THE

03:21:44.358 --> 03:21:45.860
COST REBUILDING IN ALL THESE

03:21:45.927 --> 03:21:48.696
AREAS IS IS HORRENDOUS IDEA OF

03:21:48.763 --> 03:21:50.498
BLAKE COUNTY.

03:21:50.565 --> 03:21:51.766
THE VALLEY FIRE FOUR YEARS AGO

03:21:51.833 --> 03:21:54.635
EVAN ACHIEVE 20% REBUILD YET IT

03:21:54.702 --> 03:21:57.972
LA IN AN NAM PARADISE LOST.

03:21:58.039 --> 03:21:58.539
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR --

03:21:58.606 --> 03:22:00.074
PARADISE AND WE GET A LOS

03:22:00.141 --> 03:22:00.708
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND HOMES AND AND

03:22:00.775 --> 03:22:01.709
CONQUER OUT.

03:22:01.776 --> 03:22:02.577
OF IT YET --

03:22:02.643 --> 03:22:04.078
Là AB YEAH HATE TO THINK WHAT

03:22:04.145 --> 03:22:06.747
THAT'S WHAT THAT DOES TO THE

03:22:06.814 --> 03:22:07.849
ECONOMY THERE AND ALL THE PEOPLE

03:22:07.915 --> 03:22:09.417
THAT ARE DISPLACED SO ANYTHING

03:22:09.484 --> 03:22:14.822
YOU CAN DO. TO MAKE IT EASIER TO

03:22:14.889 --> 03:22:15.056
REBUILD.

03:22:15.122 --> 03:22:15.790
I THINK.

03:22:15.857 --> 03:22:16.591

03:22:16.657 --> 03:22:18.292
THE CHAIR AND I A GOING FORWARD

03:22:18.359 --> 03:22:19.594
I MEAN THE TESTIMONY WE RECEIVED

03:22:19.660 --> 03:22:21.062
TODAY.

03:22:21.128 --> 03:22:23.464
IT'S INCREDIBLY COMPELLING AND

03:22:23.531 --> 03:22:25.700
THIS IDEA OF AT LEAST PRIMING

03:22:25.766 --> 03:22:27.201
THE PUMP AND GETTING STARTED ON

03:22:27.268 --> 03:22:28.469
THE INCENTIVE CITING COMING UP

03:22:28.536 --> 03:22:29.871

03:22:29.937 --> 03:22:33.374
A WHOLE SUITE OF OF STATE

03:22:33.441 --> 03:22:34.609
INCENTIVES WHERE WE'RE

03:22:34.675 --> 03:22:36.277
INTEGRATING WITH THE LOCALS BUT

03:22:36.344 --> 03:22:37.778
THE KIND OF YOU KNOW WHETHER

03:22:37.845 --> 03:22:39.547
IT'S IN THE TAX CODE OR WHETHER

03:22:39.614 --> 03:22:40.414
IT'S THROUGH SOME EXISTING

03:22:40.481 --> 03:22:41.649
PROGRAMS WE HAVE I MEAN THERE'S

03:22:41.716 --> 03:22:43.751
ALREADY OF A FAIR AMOUNT OF

03:22:43.818 --> 03:22:45.987
FUNDING APPROPRIATED --

03:22:46.053 --> 03:22:46.787
BUT WHETHER WE NEED NEW

03:22:46.854 --> 03:22:48.389
MECHANISMS TO ADMINISTER SOME OF

03:22:48.456 --> 03:22:50.291
THAT IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA

03:22:50.358 --> 03:22:51.893
BE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT MEAN

03:22:51.959 --> 03:22:52.793
ANY.

03:22:52.860 --> 03:22:54.161
YEAH ANY FEEDBACK YOU ALL MIGHT

03:22:54.228 --> 03:22:56.297
HAVE IN THE FUTURE ON ON WHAT

03:22:56.364 --> 03:22:57.298
THAT STRUCTURE LOOKS LIKE WE

03:22:57.365 --> 03:22:59.166
KNOW THAT EVERY COMMUNITIES ALSO

03:22:59.233 --> 03:23:00.134
DIFFERENT AND BUYING POWERS

03:23:00.201 --> 03:23:02.703
DIFFERENT RIGHT AND SO EVEN IN.

03:23:02.770 --> 03:23:04.105
YOU KNOW TAKE THE WILL THE FIRE

03:23:04.171 --> 03:23:08.376
MALIBU SEMINAL SPRINGS WHICH IS.

03:23:08.442 --> 03:23:10.344
LOW INCOME TRAILER PARK RIGHT

03:23:10.411 --> 03:23:13.080
NEXT TO A MANSION RIGHT AND AND

03:23:13.147 --> 03:23:14.348
THEY'RE NOT THAT FAR APART AND

03:23:14.415 --> 03:23:15.850
WE KNOW THAT THOSE SITUATIONS.

03:23:15.917 --> 03:23:17.418
YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT BIG

03:23:17.485 --> 03:23:18.586
BEAUTIFUL HOME IN THE MOUNTAINS

03:23:18.653 --> 03:23:20.221
OR YOU COULD BE LIVING YOU KNOW

03:23:20.288 --> 03:23:22.657
ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE VERY NEARBY

03:23:22.723 --> 03:23:22.990
AND SO.

03:23:23.057 --> 03:23:25.259
HAD A SORT OF TAYLOR THAT AND

03:23:25.326 --> 03:23:27.395
AND FIND THAT SWEET SPOT I THINK

03:23:27.461 --> 03:23:29.230
WILL BE AN IMPORTANT ISSUE GOING

03:23:29.297 --> 03:23:31.265
FORWARD THERE WERE THIRTY THREE

03:23:31.332 --> 03:23:32.600
MOBILE HOME PARKS THE IN THE

03:23:32.667 --> 03:23:33.668
EFFORT TO BURN DOWN IN.

03:23:33.734 --> 03:23:35.369
OTHER LOT OF MANUFACTURED HOMES

03:23:35.436 --> 03:23:37.471
SO THE HOUSING STOCK IS VERY

03:23:37.538 --> 03:23:38.773
DIFFERENT THAN SHOWREEL WHEN

03:23:38.839 --> 03:23:40.741
THEY CAN COPY PARK YEAH AND IT'S

03:23:40.808 --> 03:23:42.143
AWFUL TO WATCH THE THE ON THE

03:23:42.209 --> 03:23:43.077
MOBILE HOME SITES ESPECIALLY THE

03:23:43.144 --> 03:23:44.845
OLDER HOMES --

03:23:44.912 --> 03:23:45.913
JUST HOW COMBUSTIBLE THEY ARE

03:23:45.980 --> 03:23:47.415
AND HOW DIFFICULT THEY ARE TO

03:23:47.481 --> 03:23:48.649
RETROFIT AND JUST HAVE

03:23:48.716 --> 03:23:52.286
DECIMATING IT CAN BE OUT THERE I

03:23:52.353 --> 03:23:54.255
DID WANT TO GIVE --

03:23:54.322 --> 03:23:55.856
CHIEF PIMLOTT JUST A CHANCE. TO

03:23:55.923 --> 03:23:57.058
TO COME BACK TO US I KNOW YOU

03:23:57.124 --> 03:23:58.292
HAD A FEW OUTSTANDING ISSUES BUT

03:23:58.359 --> 03:24:01.362
I THEY WANT TO COME BACK.

03:24:01.429 --> 03:24:02.897
TO THAT YOU DIDN'T GET TO IN

03:24:02.964 --> 03:24:04.632
YOUR EARLIER REMARKS AS BROWN'S

03:24:04.699 --> 03:24:05.800
JUST EMPHASIZING A COUPLE OF

03:24:05.866 --> 03:24:06.667
THINGS THAT --

03:24:06.734 --> 03:24:08.202
I HEARD TODAY THAT I THINK ARE

03:24:08.269 --> 03:24:09.103
GOING TO BE --

03:24:09.170 --> 03:24:10.738
IMPORTANT ANDERSON SOME THESE

03:24:10.805 --> 03:24:12.106
OUTSIDE THE BOX --

03:24:12.173 --> 03:24:13.774
CONVERSATIONS THAT I THINK WE

03:24:13.841 --> 03:24:15.743
NEED TO BE BE HAVING THAT PLAYED

03:24:15.810 --> 03:24:17.478
OUT IN THE CAMP FIRE --

03:24:17.545 --> 03:24:18.980
BUT ALSO SOME NEW THINGS ONE IS

03:24:19.046 --> 03:24:20.915
THIS THE CONCEPT OF THE

03:24:20.982 --> 03:24:22.216
SHELTERING IN PLACE --

03:24:22.283 --> 03:24:23.384
YOU KNOW THAT HAPPENED JUST

03:24:23.451 --> 03:24:25.052
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT FIREFIGHTERS

03:24:25.119 --> 03:24:26.754
DID AND THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE WENT.

03:24:26.821 --> 03:24:29.056
JUST BECAUSE IN ON THE CAMPFIRE

03:24:29.123 --> 03:24:31.258
AND THEY BE NO THEY GRAVITATED

03:24:31.325 --> 03:24:32.727
TO A PARKING LOT IN A STRUCTURE

03:24:32.793 --> 03:24:33.961
THAT WAS DEFENDABLE AND

03:24:34.028 --> 03:24:35.262
FIREFIGHTERS WERE ABLE.

03:24:35.329 --> 03:24:38.699
TO PROTECT THOSE CITIZENS THEY

03:24:38.766 --> 03:24:40.001
WE EVACUATED.

03:24:40.067 --> 03:24:41.302
YOU KNOW WE LEARNED A LOT FROM

03:24:41.369 --> 03:24:43.404
THE FIRES IN VICTORIA AUSTRALIA

03:24:43.471 --> 03:24:44.372
FROM THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS

03:24:44.438 --> 03:24:46.007
WHERE THE HEY HAD A STAY AND

03:24:46.073 --> 03:24:47.608
DEFEND POLICY WHERE THEY ALLOW

03:24:47.675 --> 03:24:49.010
HOMEOWNERS ENCOURAGE THEM TO

03:24:49.076 --> 03:24:50.478
STAY IN THEIR HOMES.

03:24:50.544 --> 03:24:51.779
WHEN THE FIRE BLEW THROUGH AND

03:24:51.846 --> 03:24:53.381
WHAT HAPPENED IS OVER TWO

03:24:53.447 --> 03:24:54.115
HUNDRED PEOPLE DIED?

03:24:54.181 --> 03:24:55.082
BECAUSE WHEN THE FIRE HIT THE

03:24:55.149 --> 03:24:56.083
COMMUNITY THEIR HOMES THEY

03:24:56.150 --> 03:24:57.585
REALIZE THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE

03:24:57.652 --> 03:24:59.387
WITH FIRE WERE SCARED AND THEY

03:24:59.453 --> 03:25:01.389
ALL CHOSE TO LEAVE AT A TIME

03:25:01.455 --> 03:25:02.189
WHEN THE FIRE WAS ACTUALLY

03:25:02.256 --> 03:25:02.890
PINGING.

03:25:02.957 --> 03:25:03.991
THOSE PEOPLE ACTUALLY DIED OUT

03:25:04.058 --> 03:25:05.893
ON ON ROADS AND SO WE IN THE

03:25:05.960 --> 03:25:06.961
STATE THE FIRE SERVICE

03:25:07.028 --> 03:25:08.429
COLLECTIVELY LOOKED AT A READY

03:25:08.496 --> 03:25:09.397
SET GO.

03:25:09.463 --> 03:25:11.432
A POLICY WHERE IT WAS GET PEOPLE

03:25:11.499 --> 03:25:12.800
OUT DO ALL THE THINGS YOU TO

03:25:12.867 --> 03:25:14.435
PREPARE AND THEN WHEN THE FIRES

03:25:14.502 --> 03:25:16.470
THERE YOU KNOW EVACUATE EVACUATE

03:25:16.537 --> 03:25:18.506
EARLY AND ALLOW FIREFIGHTERS IN

03:25:18.572 --> 03:25:19.373
LAWN FORTUNE TO COME IN AND DO

03:25:19.440 --> 03:25:20.474
THEIR THING.

03:25:20.541 --> 03:25:22.143
I THINK WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THE

03:25:22.209 --> 03:25:24.111
CAMP FIRE IS THAT WE STILL WANT

03:25:24.178 --> 03:25:26.213
TO MAKE SURE THAT EVACUATION IS

03:25:26.280 --> 03:25:27.882
THE FIRST PRIORITY THAT WE DON'T

03:25:27.948 --> 03:25:28.849
WANT PEOPLE.

03:25:28.916 --> 03:25:30.151
SHELTERING IN THEIR BASEMENTS

03:25:30.217 --> 03:25:31.886
LIKE YOU WOULD FOR A TORNADO IN

03:25:31.952 --> 03:25:35.523
THE MIDWEST BUT WE ALSO

03:25:35.589 --> 03:25:36.424
RECOGNIZE.

03:25:36.490 --> 03:25:37.324
MUNIZ WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET

03:25:37.391 --> 03:25:37.925
EVERYBODY OUT THROUGH

03:25:37.992 --> 03:25:38.492
EVACUATIONS BECAUSE OF HOW

03:25:38.559 --> 03:25:40.361
QUICKLY SO WE NEED TO BE LOOKING

03:25:40.428 --> 03:25:41.696
AT THESE IN TERMS OF PRE

03:25:41.762 --> 03:25:43.731
DESIGNATED.

03:25:43.798 --> 03:25:45.232
HARD YOU KNOW HARDENED AREAS

03:25:45.299 --> 03:25:47.201
THAT ARE STAFFED BY FIREFIGHTERS

03:25:47.268 --> 03:25:48.502
ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT OR PUBLIC

03:25:48.569 --> 03:25:50.638
SAFETY OFFICIALS THAT CAN BE

03:25:50.705 --> 03:25:51.305
THERE FOR THE WELL BEING OF THE

03:25:51.372 --> 03:25:52.073
SCREEN THERE.

03:25:52.139 --> 03:25:53.040
THEY'RE NO DIFFERENT THAN --

03:25:53.107 --> 03:25:55.109
I EVACUATION ZONE FROM A FLOOD

03:25:55.176 --> 03:25:56.610
HERE'S WHERE YOU GO IF YOU LIVE

03:25:56.677 --> 03:25:58.879
IN X. PART OF TOWN AND HAVE ALL

03:25:58.946 --> 03:26:00.548
THAT INGRAINED IN EVERYBODY'S

03:26:00.614 --> 03:26:01.782
THOUGHT PROCESS SO THAT AT LEAST.

03:26:01.849 --> 03:26:03.484
THEY KNOW WHERE THEY CAN GO WHEN

03:26:03.551 --> 03:26:04.418
THEY HAVE TO MAKE THAT DECISION

03:26:04.485 --> 03:26:05.453
THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

03:26:05.519 --> 03:26:06.554
THINGS I THINK WE HAVE TO BE

03:26:06.620 --> 03:26:07.922
THINKING ABOUT AS LONG AS RICH.

03:26:07.988 --> 03:26:09.924
AS WELL TALK ABOUT HARDENING OF

03:26:09.990 --> 03:26:13.227
INFRASTRUCTURE ALL WITH ME THAT --

03:26:13.294 --> 03:26:14.628
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED

03:26:14.695 --> 03:26:15.930
TO CONSIDER AS PART OF THIS

03:26:15.996 --> 03:26:17.765
BROADER MITIGATION.

03:26:17.832 --> 03:26:18.833
AND I BELIEVE IT WAS DIRECTOR

03:26:18.899 --> 03:26:19.934
KILLER DUCHIN MAYBE LEASE ONE

03:26:20.000 --> 03:26:21.335
OTHER THAT BROUGHT THAT UP AND

03:26:21.402 --> 03:26:22.536
THAT'S THERE MAY BE AREAS THAT

03:26:22.603 --> 03:26:24.271
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE JUST

03:26:24.338 --> 03:26:25.539
AREN'T DEFENDABLE --

03:26:25.606 --> 03:26:27.541
THAT WHERE WE NEED TO FACTOR

03:26:27.608 --> 03:26:29.910
INTO OUR GENERAL PLANS ARE

03:26:29.977 --> 03:26:31.112
MITIGATION PLANS THAT THEY'RE

03:26:31.178 --> 03:26:32.179
NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO BE

03:26:32.246 --> 03:26:35.049
BUILDABLE ARE THERE OPTIONS. TO

03:26:35.116 --> 03:26:36.417
MAKE AN OPEN SPACE TO ACTUALLY

03:26:36.484 --> 03:26:38.452
PURCHASE THAT OUT WHETHER IT'S

03:26:38.519 --> 03:26:39.086
IMMINENT DOOM IT WHATEVER THAT

03:26:39.153 --> 03:26:40.287
IS --

03:26:40.354 --> 03:26:42.289
UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT DOES

03:26:42.356 --> 03:26:43.858
COME WITH A HUGE LIABILITY FOR

03:26:43.924 --> 03:26:44.925
WHOMEVER NOW BECOMES THE OWNER

03:26:44.992 --> 03:26:46.527
OF THAT PROPERTY WHETHER IT'S

03:26:46.594 --> 03:26:47.995
PUBLIC OR THROUGH AN A AND H.

03:26:48.062 --> 03:26:49.130
AWAY.

03:26:49.196 --> 03:26:50.831
BUT THAT MAY BE ANOTHER OPTION

03:26:50.898 --> 03:26:54.502
TO TRY TO HELP GET SOME OF THESE

03:26:54.568 --> 03:26:55.569
AREAS THAT ARE JUST NOT.

03:26:55.636 --> 03:26:56.537
BUILDABLE FROM A SAFETY

03:26:56.604 --> 03:26:57.204
PERSPECTIVE --

03:26:57.271 --> 03:26:58.873
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS I THINK

03:26:58.939 --> 03:27:01.642
WE'VE REALLY GOT TO BE --

03:27:01.709 --> 03:27:02.777
YOUR LOCAL LAND USE PLANNING

03:27:02.843 --> 03:27:04.445
DECISIONS.

03:27:04.512 --> 03:27:05.412
THIS TIES THAT IS A STATE WIDE

03:27:05.479 --> 03:27:07.982
ISSUE AND WE WORKED REAL HARD ON

03:27:08.048 --> 03:27:09.650
TO US SENATE BILL.

03:27:09.717 --> 03:27:10.217
TWELVE FORTY ONE WAS SENATOR

03:27:10.284 --> 03:27:11.585
KEOGH TO START THIS LAND USE

03:27:11.652 --> 03:27:12.987
PLANNING DISCUSSION AT THE STATE

03:27:13.053 --> 03:27:14.555
LEVEL.

03:27:14.622 --> 03:27:16.624
BUT EVEN TODAY IT'S STILL JUST.

03:27:16.690 --> 03:27:18.592
ADVICE IT'S STILL JUST THE STATE

03:27:18.659 --> 03:27:20.327
AND LOCAL EXPERTS SITTING DOWN

03:27:20.394 --> 03:27:22.329
WITH PLANNING OFFICIALS --

03:27:22.396 --> 03:27:24.098
LOCAL OFFICIALS REALLY NEED TO

03:27:24.165 --> 03:27:25.733
HAVE SOME TEETH TO BE ABLE.

03:27:25.800 --> 03:27:26.801
TO ENFORCE IT SOME OF THOSE

03:27:26.867 --> 03:27:28.002
GUIDELINES WHEN THEY'RE MAKING

03:27:28.068 --> 03:27:30.604
THESE TOUGH DECISIONS IN FORCE A

03:27:30.671 --> 03:27:31.772
PROCESS THAT ALLOWS.

03:27:31.839 --> 03:27:33.374
FOR DOING SOME MITIGATION

03:27:33.440 --> 03:27:34.141
CRITERIA --

03:27:34.208 --> 03:27:35.142
I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE SOME

03:27:35.209 --> 03:27:37.478
AREAS WHERE I THINK WE IN THE

03:27:37.545 --> 03:27:39.280
ENFORCEMENT SIDE.

03:27:39.346 --> 03:27:41.382
SO FOR OUR FIRE FIGHTING

03:27:41.448 --> 03:27:43.150
PERSONNEL THAN HERE.

03:27:43.217 --> 03:27:44.685
I MEAN HAVE YOU HAD EXPERIENCES

03:27:44.752 --> 03:27:47.087
DEALING WITH THAT LOCAL LAND USE

03:27:47.154 --> 03:27:49.190
PLANNING PROCESS WHERE YOU SEEN

03:27:49.256 --> 03:27:49.490
[inaudible]

03:27:49.557 --> 03:27:51.425
THEM LISTEN.

03:27:51.492 --> 03:27:53.527
A DIFFERENTLY WHEN YOU'RE THE IS

03:27:53.594 --> 03:27:54.328

I THEIR PARTICIPATION IN GENERAL

03:28:01.202 --> 03:28:03.037
PLANNING PROCESS I I DON'T KNOW

03:28:03.103 --> 03:28:04.438
HOW MUCH INTERFACES THAT YOU GOT

03:28:04.505 --> 03:28:06.373
IT'S GOT A LOT OF OTHER THINGS

03:28:06.440 --> 03:28:08.108
TO BE DOING TO BUT IS THAT A

03:28:08.175 --> 03:28:10.477
COMPLETE THAT A VIABLE PATH TO

03:28:10.544 --> 03:28:12.746
SORT OF JUST GETTING MORE

03:28:12.813 --> 03:28:13.647
INVOLVED IN THAT GOVERNANCE

03:28:13.714 --> 03:28:14.281
PROCESS.

03:28:14.348 --> 03:28:15.916
IN NO WE WE ARE CURRENTLY

03:28:15.983 --> 03:28:18.052
INVOLVED IN IN THAT A OUR AGENTS

03:28:18.118 --> 03:28:19.453
YOU KNOW FIRE AGENCIES LAW

03:28:19.520 --> 03:28:21.121
ENFORCEMENT ARE ALWAYS INVOLVED

03:28:21.188 --> 03:28:22.623
IN THE GENERAL PLAN IS PART OF

03:28:22.690 --> 03:28:24.425
THE SAFETY ELEMENT IN LOOKING AT

03:28:24.491 --> 03:28:25.826
YOU KNOW THOSE RISKS EXIST IN

03:28:25.893 --> 03:28:27.394
THE COMMUNITY WERE INVOLVED IN

03:28:27.461 --> 03:28:28.829
HELPING DEVELOP THE HAZARD

03:28:28.896 --> 03:28:29.563
MITIGATION.

03:28:29.630 --> 03:28:31.365
PLANS IN PULLING THOSE THINGS

03:28:31.432 --> 03:28:33.334
TOGETHER AND COMMENTING ON THEM

03:28:33.400 --> 03:28:33.868
YOU KNOW WERE SOME OF THE

03:28:33.934 --> 03:28:35.069
CHALLENGES.

03:28:35.135 --> 03:28:36.203
YOU CAN LIE IT'S YOU KNOW

DIFFERENT AREAS YEAH I WAS GONNA

03:28:39.707 --> 03:28:40.274
SAY I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT BUT

03:28:40.341 --> 03:28:40.908
THE CITY.

03:28:40.975 --> 03:28:44.111
SAFETY SIDE ONE THING YOU GET

03:28:44.178 --> 03:28:47.081
DOWN TO THE SPECIFIC IF FORTY

03:28:47.147 --> 03:28:48.515
SOME OF IT COMES BACK TO

03:28:48.582 --> 03:28:50.084
RELATIONSHIPS IF YOU KNOW

03:28:50.150 --> 03:28:51.552
RELATIONSHIPS ARE IMPORTANT

03:28:51.619 --> 03:28:52.353
CRITICAL PIECE.

03:28:52.419 --> 03:28:54.455
BUT THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY

03:28:54.521 --> 03:28:56.190
SOMETHING THAT SOLVE THE LOCKS

03:28:56.257 --> 03:28:57.858
US TOGETHER RADIO WOULD THEN IN

03:28:57.925 --> 03:28:59.226
IN MY PARTICULAR CASE I'M A

03:28:59.293 --> 03:29:00.694
SPECIAL DISTRICT OVERLAYS TO

03:29:00.761 --> 03:29:02.529
CITIES WE HAVE GREAT WORKING

03:29:02.596 --> 03:29:03.998
RELATIONSHIPS WITH BOTH OF THE

03:29:04.064 --> 03:29:05.366
CITIES IN OR JURISDICTION.

03:29:05.432 --> 03:29:06.867
WERE INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN MANY

03:29:06.934 --> 03:29:08.669
OF THE DECISIONS BEING MADE FOR

03:29:08.736 --> 03:29:10.404
NEW CONSTRUCTION OR PLANNED

03:29:10.471 --> 03:29:11.639
DEVELOPMENT --

03:29:11.705 --> 03:29:13.140
MASTER PLANNING STRATEGIC

03:29:13.207 --> 03:29:14.208
PLANNING --

03:29:14.275 --> 03:29:15.609
YOU KNOW WHERE OTHERS YOU KNOW

03:29:15.676 --> 03:29:16.744
IT'S IT'S DEPENDED UPON

03:29:16.810 --> 03:29:18.112
RELATIONSHIPS YOU KNOW THAT WHEN

03:29:18.178 --> 03:29:19.680
YOU'RE A A CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT

03:29:19.747 --> 03:29:20.981
OR A DEPENDENT.

03:29:21.048 --> 03:29:23.083
COUNTY YOU KNOW FIRE DISTRICT

03:29:23.150 --> 03:29:24.218
YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE

03:29:24.285 --> 03:29:25.953
RELATIONSHIPS CAN BE --

03:29:26.020 --> 03:29:27.054
BUT LITTLE MORE COHESIVE BECAUSE

03:29:27.121 --> 03:29:28.222
YOU'RE BOTH REPORTING TO THE

03:29:28.289 --> 03:29:29.556
SAME BOSS AT THE END OF THE DAY

03:29:29.623 --> 03:29:30.858
BUT IT'S ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS

03:29:30.925 --> 03:29:32.559
ABOUT INVOLVEMENT IN WERE YOU

03:29:32.626 --> 03:29:34.395
KNOW WE ARE ABSOLUTELY --

03:29:34.461 --> 03:29:36.931
INVOLVED IN IN BRINGING THAT

03:29:36.997 --> 03:29:38.365
PIECE FORD M. IF IF YOU MAY I

03:29:38.432 --> 03:29:40.401
TOUCH ON THE THE THE CODE PIECE

03:29:40.467 --> 03:29:41.568
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

03:29:41.635 --> 03:29:42.937
MINUTE AGO.

03:29:43.003 --> 03:29:44.271
THAT -- BIT.

03:29:44.338 --> 03:29:45.172
RIGHT NOW THE CITY CALIFORNIA IS

03:29:45.239 --> 03:29:46.640
IN THE PROCESS OF ADOPTING THE

03:29:46.707 --> 03:29:48.943
CALIFORNIA STATE FIRE CODES TO

03:29:49.009 --> 03:29:50.377
THE INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL --

03:29:50.444 --> 03:29:51.512
EVERY THREE YEARS THROUGH THE

03:29:51.578 --> 03:29:52.780
CONSENSUS BUILDING PROCESS

03:29:52.846 --> 03:29:55.215
BUILDS THE MODEL CODE AND IN THE

03:29:55.282 --> 03:29:57.217
CALIFORNIA TAKES THAT MODEL CODE

03:29:57.284 --> 03:29:58.452
IN ROLES IN.

03:29:58.519 --> 03:29:59.987
CALIFORNIA AMENDMENTS AND THEY

03:30:00.054 --> 03:30:00.988
HAVE A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS OF

03:30:01.055 --> 03:30:02.256
BASICALLY BY JUNE THIRTIETH THEY

03:30:02.323 --> 03:30:03.724
NEED TO ROLL OUT THE CALIFORNIA

03:30:03.791 --> 03:30:05.893
FIRE CODE IN WHICH LOCAL

03:30:05.960 --> 03:30:09.830
AGENCIES THEN HAVE A HUNDRED

03:30:09.897 --> 03:30:12.733
EIGHTY DAYS IN A QUESTION THE

03:30:12.800 --> 03:30:14.535
CODE IS THAT THE LOCAL AGENCY

03:30:14.601 --> 03:30:16.470
CANNOT ADOPT A CODE THAT IS LESS

03:30:16.537 --> 03:30:17.371
LENIENT.

03:30:17.438 --> 03:30:19.073
THAN WHAT THE STATE ADOPTS WE

03:30:19.139 --> 03:30:21.275
CAN BE MORE STRINGENT BUT WE CAN

03:30:21.342 --> 03:30:22.609
ONLY BE MORE STRINGENT IF

03:30:22.676 --> 03:30:23.844
THERE'S TOPOGRAPHIC.

03:30:23.911 --> 03:30:26.814
GEOLOGIC.

03:30:26.880 --> 03:30:28.983
CLIMACTIC IN THERE'S ONE MORE

03:30:29.049 --> 03:30:30.985
APOLOGIZE HAVE DINNER THERE'S

03:30:31.051 --> 03:30:32.186
FOUR THERE'S FOUR FACTORS TO

03:30:32.252 --> 03:30:33.354
GIVE US THE ABILITY AND HAD THE

03:30:33.420 --> 03:30:34.788
IN ORDER FOR US TO MAKE.

03:30:34.855 --> 03:30:36.056
A PROVISION IN OUR CODE MORE

03:30:36.123 --> 03:30:37.591
STRANGE IT HAS TO BE DEPENDENT

03:30:37.658 --> 03:30:40.894
ON A SPECIAL RISK OR UNIQUE RISK

03:30:40.961 --> 03:30:42.596
EXISTS IN OUR COMMUNITY MEAN

03:30:42.663 --> 03:30:43.964
TOWN OF PARADISE AND ISSUES AS

03:30:44.031 --> 03:30:45.065
AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE AT SOME POINT

03:30:45.132 --> 03:30:46.400
OF OUR CONVERSATION.

03:30:46.467 --> 03:30:48.669
IT'S SURROUNDED BY A DEEP CAP

03:30:48.736 --> 03:30:49.837
YOU KNOW --

03:30:49.903 --> 03:30:53.073
CANYONS THAT ARE OPEN LAND BLM

03:30:53.140 --> 03:30:55.009
LAND THAT POSES A HAZARD IT'S

03:30:55.075 --> 03:30:57.177
UNIQUE COMPARED TO THE CITY OF

03:30:57.244 --> 03:30:58.712
SACRAMENTO OR THE CITY OF ELK

03:30:58.779 --> 03:31:00.147
GROVE -- BUT

03:31:00.214 --> 03:31:01.382
BUT WE CAN'T ADOPT A CODE IT'S

03:31:01.448 --> 03:31:03.417
LESS LENIENT TO THE WHAT THE

03:31:03.484 --> 03:31:04.251
STATE IS ADOPTED.

03:31:04.318 --> 03:31:06.086
NAY UNIQUENESS REQUIREMENT IS

03:31:06.153 --> 03:31:08.188
THAT A STATE LAW IS THAT IS THAT

03:31:08.255 --> 03:31:09.323
IN STATE LAUNCH THAT YEAH IT'S

03:31:09.390 --> 03:31:10.724
DEFINITELY BUT IT I KNOW IT IS

03:31:10.791 --> 03:31:11.992
IT IS PART OF THE STATE YEAH

03:31:12.059 --> 03:31:13.293
IT'S IT'S PART OF THE FIRE CODE

03:31:13.360 --> 03:31:14.895
IS BUILDING AND WHAT YOU CAN.

03:31:14.962 --> 03:31:16.830
BUILD AND SO THE STATE ADOPTED

03:31:16.897 --> 03:31:17.731
IN THE BEFORE IT ALTERNATELY

03:31:17.798 --> 03:31:19.600
COMES DOWN --

03:31:19.666 --> 03:31:20.834
TO THE LOCAL LIKE I CAN SAY TO

03:31:20.901 --> 03:31:22.269
YOU SPECIFICALLY WHERE THAT IS

03:31:22.336 --> 03:31:23.937
BUT I CAN CERTAINLY GET YOU THAT

03:31:24.004 --> 03:31:25.005
INFORMATION SO TO MISTER TOWNS

03:31:25.072 --> 03:31:26.774
ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING AT THAT'S

03:31:26.840 --> 03:31:27.941
COMING DOWN THE PIKE IT SOUNDS

03:31:28.008 --> 03:31:29.977
LIKE SO HOW HOW HOW DOES BUTTE

03:31:30.044 --> 03:31:30.577
PLANNED.

03:31:30.644 --> 03:31:31.912
BUT WE HAVE A CONVERSATION AHEAD

03:31:31.979 --> 03:31:33.347
OF US ACTUALLY WORK WE WILL BE

03:31:33.414 --> 03:31:34.581
ADOPTING THE NEW COSTA QUESTION

03:31:34.648 --> 03:31:36.450
IS I THINK FOR US IS ARE WE

03:31:36.517 --> 03:31:38.185
GONNA BE MORE STRINGENT ON THE

03:31:38.252 --> 03:31:39.019
LOCAL LEVEL NOT.

03:31:39.086 --> 03:31:41.221
THERE I DON'T KNOW A PATH AS IN

03:31:41.288 --> 03:31:42.756
THE FOR PARAMETERS --

03:31:42.823 --> 03:31:45.192
TO BE MORE LENIENT AND I THINK

03:31:45.259 --> 03:31:46.360
THAT THAT'S A HARD.

03:31:46.427 --> 03:31:52.099
YOU KNOW POINT TO MAKE I THINK

03:31:52.166 --> 03:31:52.699
THE WORK WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE

03:31:52.766 --> 03:31:55.402
DISK NEW.

03:31:55.469 --> 03:31:57.004
MANUFACTURED HOMES THE IN THE

03:31:57.071 --> 03:31:58.305
PAST THE COULD BE.

03:31:58.372 --> 03:32:00.407
AS OLD AS NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN

03:32:00.474 --> 03:32:02.076
AND BE INSTALLED IN THE COUNTY

03:32:02.142 --> 03:32:03.710
THOSE ARE THOSE ARE NOT.

03:32:03.777 --> 03:32:06.113
VERY SAFE IN MY OPINION A UNITS

03:32:06.180 --> 03:32:06.880
TO BE INSTALLING SO WE ADOPTED A

03:32:06.947 --> 03:32:09.416
CO THAT LIMITS THE AGE TO TEN

03:32:09.483 --> 03:32:11.018
YEARS OR NEWER.

03:32:11.085 --> 03:32:11.652
SO THAT'S THE ONE OF THE FIRST

03:32:11.718 --> 03:32:13.187
THINGS WE'VE DONE.

03:32:13.253 --> 03:32:14.054
IN THE COMING THAT'S ALLOWED

03:32:14.121 --> 03:32:15.823
THROUGH STATE LAW.

03:32:15.889 --> 03:32:16.423
IN.

03:32:16.490 --> 03:32:18.358
DO YOU OF WOOD YOU'LL FIND THE

03:32:18.425 --> 03:32:19.093
FOR THE FOR A LOCAL GOVERNMENT

03:32:19.159 --> 03:32:22.196
FOLKS HERE THE THE KIND OF

03:32:22.262 --> 03:32:23.997
TRAINING THAT.

03:32:24.064 --> 03:32:25.032
OUR FORMER AS FAR STATE FIRE

03:32:25.099 --> 03:32:27.301
MARSHAL MENTION FOR HELPING CITY

03:32:27.367 --> 03:32:29.169
PLANNERS AND LOCAL SORT OF TRAIN

03:32:29.236 --> 03:32:31.738
THEMSELVES IN SOME OF THESE BEST

03:32:31.805 --> 03:32:32.840
PRACTICES DO YOU MEAN.

03:32:32.906 --> 03:32:34.641
DO I MEAN YOU YOU YOU ALL ARE IN

03:32:34.708 --> 03:32:36.009
FIRE COUNTRYSIDE IMAGINE THERE'S

03:32:36.076 --> 03:32:38.679
SORT OF A NATURAL INTEREST TO GO

03:32:38.745 --> 03:32:40.747
DO THAT BUT YOU DO GET HAVE YOU

03:32:40.814 --> 03:32:41.315
SEEN THAT SORT OF WITHIN THE

03:32:41.381 --> 03:32:43.550
RANKS THE JUST LACK OF TRAINING

03:32:43.617 --> 03:32:44.885
FAMILIAR.

03:32:44.952 --> 03:32:46.320
I HAVE TWO FIREMAN IN MY OFFICE

03:32:46.386 --> 03:32:48.489
SO THERE'S VERY CLOSE

03:32:48.555 --> 03:32:49.690
COORDINATION WITH YELL FIRE.

03:32:49.756 --> 03:32:50.958
YOU CAN FIRE SO --

03:32:51.024 --> 03:32:53.127
I THINK THROUGH THE CONFERENCE'S

03:32:53.193 --> 03:32:55.295
ASSOCIATIONS BUT THERE'S ALWAYS

03:32:55.362 --> 03:32:57.164
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT.

03:32:57.231 --> 03:32:58.398
I THINK THE I THINK THE FIRE

03:32:58.465 --> 03:32:59.967
CHIEFS IN THE FIRE MARSHALL'S IN

03:33:00.033 --> 03:33:02.269
OUR COMMUNITY WOULD APPRECIATE

03:33:02.336 --> 03:33:03.504
HAVING THE PLANNERS HAVE A

03:33:03.570 --> 03:33:04.938
GREATER UNDERSTANDING.

03:33:05.005 --> 03:33:06.440
OF THAT THAT MAKES IT A LITTLE

03:33:06.507 --> 03:33:08.909
BIT EASIER TO EXPLAIN AND GET

03:33:08.976 --> 03:33:10.844
THINGS ACROSS BOB AND ONE TWELVE

03:33:10.911 --> 03:33:11.745
FORTY ONE PASSED THE FOR THE

03:33:11.812 --> 03:33:13.881

HAVE THAT MORE DIRECT CONTACT

03:33:15.315 --> 03:33:16.617
THE LOCAL LEVEL YOU'RE NEVER

03:33:16.683 --> 03:33:18.152
FULLY MATERIALIZE FROM FROM A

03:33:18.218 --> 03:33:20.254
BUDGET PERSPECTIVES I THINK FROM.

03:33:20.320 --> 03:33:20.988
THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE.

03:33:21.054 --> 03:33:22.189
OBVIOUSLY I WOULD LIKE TO SEE

03:33:22.256 --> 03:33:23.824
THEM HAVE MORE RESOURCES TO

03:33:23.891 --> 03:33:25.759
ENGAGE WITH THE COUNTY AND LOCAL

03:33:25.826 --> 03:33:27.094
PARTNERS ON THAT.

RESEARCHER --

03:33:32.699 --> 03:33:35.002
MAYBE I SHOULD DIRECT THIS --

03:33:35.068 --> 03:33:38.038
TO MERE LAUDER --

03:33:38.105 --> 03:33:38.572
ANYONE COULD GET ANSWERED

03:33:38.639 --> 03:33:40.407
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA TO REBUILD

03:33:40.474 --> 03:33:42.075
HOMES AND THERE ARE A LOT OF

03:33:42.142 --> 03:33:43.010
COMPONENTS TO BUILDING HOMES

03:33:43.076 --> 03:33:44.411
THAT WERE DISCOURAGING THE USE

03:33:44.478 --> 03:33:45.646
OF GAS FOR COOKING.

03:33:45.712 --> 03:33:47.147

DEVICES THAT --

03:33:50.284 --> 03:33:52.686
YOU NEED TO HAVE POWER.

03:33:52.753 --> 03:33:54.488
FOR AND SO THE CULPRIT IT SEEMS

03:33:54.555 --> 03:33:55.889
TO ME WAS HIGH.

03:33:55.956 --> 03:33:58.859
SUPER WHIMS AND POOR.

03:33:58.926 --> 03:34:00.727
UTILITY POLES OF MINES AND

03:34:00.794 --> 03:34:01.595
CONNECTORS [inaudible]

03:34:01.662 --> 03:34:03.463
SO.

03:34:03.530 --> 03:34:05.232
THE OFTEN ROOMS P. JEANNIE AND

03:34:05.299 --> 03:34:07.601
THEIR CHAPTER ELEVEN BANKRUPTCY

03:34:07.668 --> 03:34:10.604
SO -- WHAT

03:34:10.671 --> 03:34:11.638
RECOMMENDATIONS DO YOU HAVE WE

03:34:11.705 --> 03:34:13.574
HAVE COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT

03:34:13.640 --> 03:34:15.342
THAT YOU DON'T SEE POWER POLES

03:34:15.409 --> 03:34:16.677
THERE EVERYTHING'S UNDERGROUND

03:34:16.743 --> 03:34:18.078
IT IT'S ALL?

03:34:18.145 --> 03:34:19.846
YOU DON'T SEE A A WIRE ANYWHERE

03:34:19.913 --> 03:34:21.748
IN THE SKY SO I'M JUST WONDERING

03:34:21.815 --> 03:34:23.116
IS AT I I THINK IN THE END

03:34:23.183 --> 03:34:25.052
THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN

03:34:25.118 --> 03:34:26.320
THAT IN IN PARADISE.

03:34:26.386 --> 03:34:28.322
I DON'T KNOW HOW PRACTICAL IT IS

03:34:28.388 --> 03:34:30.390
IN AND THAT WITH THE TERRAIN

03:34:30.457 --> 03:34:31.458
THAT WE HAVE WITH LAVA

03:34:31.525 --> 03:34:34.194
CAPTIVATED THE GEOGRAPHY IT'S A

03:34:34.261 --> 03:34:36.129
TREMENDOUSLY EXPENSIVE WHO'S

03:34:36.196 --> 03:34:37.831
GOING TO PAY FOR IT --

03:34:37.898 --> 03:34:38.966
WELL WE'RE GOING TO PAY FOR IT

03:34:39.032 --> 03:34:42.803
AND MAKES THE REBUILDING PROCESS --

03:34:42.869 --> 03:34:45.806
MORE DIFFICULT I THINK OF THE S. --

03:34:45.872 --> 03:34:47.608
NO POWER LINES --

03:34:47.674 --> 03:34:49.243
BUT I THINK WE HAVE --

03:34:49.309 --> 03:34:50.911
TO ACCEPTED THERE'S GONNA BE

03:34:50.978 --> 03:34:52.379
SOME THAT --

03:34:52.446 --> 03:34:53.880
IF WE GET THESE TREE HARDEN ONES

03:34:53.947 --> 03:34:55.782
IN AND THEY DO A BETTER JOB OF

03:34:55.849 --> 03:34:57.117
IT -- THAT

03:34:57.184 --> 03:34:58.051
WOULD CERTAINLY BE AN

03:34:58.118 --> 03:34:59.820
IMPROVEMENT BUT THE REALITY IS

03:34:59.886 --> 03:35:03.223
THIS FIRE WAS FROM THOSE HIGH KV

03:35:03.290 --> 03:35:04.992
A LINES THAT YOU SEE.

03:35:05.058 --> 03:35:06.827
A L. ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE

03:35:06.893 --> 03:35:08.996
RANCH I'M LIVING ON IN MY

03:35:09.062 --> 03:35:10.697
TRAILER NOW --

03:35:10.764 --> 03:35:11.465
TO BE GRANTED A FRIEND OF MINE

03:35:11.531 --> 03:35:14.601
OWNS HAS FOUR OF THOSE MAJOR

03:35:14.668 --> 03:35:16.270
TRANSMISSION LINES RUNNING

03:35:16.336 --> 03:35:17.337
THROUGH THE PROPERTIES --

03:35:17.404 --> 03:35:18.572
BUT WILL FAMILIAR AND BUT THAT'S

03:35:18.639 --> 03:35:19.606
WHERE THE POWER THAT'S WHERE THE

03:35:19.673 --> 03:35:23.443
THE FAILURE WAS --

03:35:23.510 --> 03:35:25.078
IN THE P. JEANNIE SYSTEM.

03:35:25.145 --> 03:35:27.180

I'M GONNA DO SOME RAPID FIRING

03:35:29.883 --> 03:35:31.918
AND ASK IF OUR PANELISTS WOULD

03:35:31.985 --> 03:35:34.187

03:35:34.254 --> 03:35:35.856
FIRST OF ALL --

03:35:35.922 --> 03:35:36.857
SO BUILDING OFFICIALS HAVE

03:35:36.923 --> 03:35:38.759
DISCRETION TO BETTER --

03:35:38.825 --> 03:35:41.028
I APPROVE REBUILDS --

03:35:41.094 --> 03:35:43.764
BASED OFF THE STANDARD WHEN THAT

03:35:43.830 --> 03:35:44.731
HOME WAS BUILT.

03:35:44.798 --> 03:35:46.199
AND THERE'S BEEN NO [inaudible]

03:35:46.266 --> 03:35:47.601
NO.

03:35:47.668 --> 03:35:50.137
BASED ON THE STANDARD OF THE

03:35:50.203 --> 03:35:50.871
CODE IN AFFECTED THE TIME THANK

03:35:50.937 --> 03:35:51.805
YOU EACH PERMIT TO BE

03:35:51.872 --> 03:35:53.173

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE

03:35:54.508 --> 03:35:56.777
CLARIFICATION SO --

03:35:56.843 --> 03:35:58.378
SHOULD THERE BE FLEXIBILITY LIKE

03:35:58.445 --> 03:35:59.179
THAT -- WITH

03:35:59.246 --> 03:36:00.714
IN -- THE

03:36:00.781 --> 03:36:05.118
WILL WE WELL THAT'S THE DEBATE

03:36:05.185 --> 03:36:06.320
THAT'S AHEAD OF US I AM NO NO I

03:36:06.386 --> 03:36:07.454
KNOW PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK SO

03:36:07.521 --> 03:36:08.622
I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE GOING

03:36:08.689 --> 03:36:10.023
WITH THAT THE TOUGHER STANDARD.

03:36:10.090 --> 03:36:11.458
IN MAKING OUR HARDENING THE

03:36:11.525 --> 03:36:13.627
STRUCTURES IN THE FIRE ZONE SOME

03:36:13.694 --> 03:36:15.295
CELLS ARE THAT'S WHERE THE

03:36:15.362 --> 03:36:16.697
BATTLE IS IS I BELIEVE ONE OF

03:36:16.763 --> 03:36:18.131
THE BATTLES IS AT ON THE

03:36:18.198 --> 03:36:19.199
BUILDING BY BUILDING.

03:36:19.266 --> 03:36:20.634
PARTIAL BY PARTIAL LEVEL.

03:36:20.701 --> 03:36:22.069
AND SO THOSE ARE THE STANDARDS I

03:36:22.135 --> 03:36:23.070
THINK THAT SHOULD BE.

03:36:23.136 --> 03:36:25.238
TIGHTENED THANK YOU REST OF THE

03:36:25.305 --> 03:36:25.472

IT A DATE EVERY PROVISIONED.

03:36:28.809 --> 03:36:32.479
SPEAK SPECIFICALLY FOR THE FIRE

03:36:32.546 --> 03:36:33.080
CONSIDER MOST FAMILIAR WITH MY

03:36:33.146 --> 03:36:33.714
WORLD.

03:36:33.780 --> 03:36:34.648
EVERY PROVISION WITHIN A FIRE

03:36:34.715 --> 03:36:35.449
CODE IS SOMETHING THAT WAS

03:36:35.515 --> 03:36:37.084
GENERATED BECAUSE SOMETHING BAD

03:36:37.150 --> 03:36:39.019
HAPPENED TO SOMEBODY YOU KNOW

03:36:39.086 --> 03:36:40.320
FROM ADAM HAVING STRICT

03:36:40.387 --> 03:36:41.722
REGULATIONS FOR ASSEMBLY

03:36:41.788 --> 03:36:43.390
OCCUPANCIES. TO RESIDENTIAL

03:36:43.457 --> 03:36:46.660
SPRINKLER SYSTEM RESIDENT NO

03:36:46.727 --> 03:36:48.729
INDIVIDUAL IS DIED IN A

03:36:48.795 --> 03:36:51.131
SPRINKLER RESIDENTIAL OCCUPANCY

03:36:51.198 --> 03:36:51.932
I MEAN THAT'S NOT SOMETHING HAS

03:36:51.998 --> 03:36:53.367
BEEN A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION.

03:36:53.433 --> 03:36:55.035
AS WE BRING THE RESIDENTIAL

03:36:55.102 --> 03:36:56.002
SPRINKLER SYSTEMS TO THE

03:36:56.069 --> 03:36:57.104
FOREFRONT YOU KNOW HIGH PILED

03:36:57.170 --> 03:37:00.640
STORAGE IN WAREHOUSES IS WE ARE

03:37:00.707 --> 03:37:01.942
NOT ALLOWED BECAUSE OF THE THE

03:37:02.008 --> 03:37:03.710
DENSITY OF MATERIALS INCLUDED

03:37:03.777 --> 03:37:05.078
INTO IT SO THAT A SPRINKLER

03:37:05.145 --> 03:37:06.413
EITHER COULDN'T CONTROL IT.

03:37:06.480 --> 03:37:07.914
OR IF THERE WAS NO SPRINKLER

03:37:07.981 --> 03:37:09.983
BECAUSE IT WAS DEVELOPED IT WAS

03:37:10.050 --> 03:37:11.218
EXISTING --

03:37:11.284 --> 03:37:12.786
NONCONFORMING TYPE OF A

03:37:12.853 --> 03:37:14.121
STRUCTURE AN INABILITY TO GET

03:37:14.187 --> 03:37:15.522
THE STREAMS TO THE BACK BUT

03:37:15.589 --> 03:37:17.224
EVERYTHING WITHIN THE CODES HAS

03:37:17.290 --> 03:37:19.960
BEEN DEVELOPED. TO ADDRESS

03:37:20.026 --> 03:37:21.595
SOMETHING THAT WASN'T DONE

03:37:21.661 --> 03:37:23.930
PROPERLY FROM SEISMIC STANDARDS

03:37:23.997 --> 03:37:26.600
IN NEED TO EXIST AS WE LEARN

03:37:26.666 --> 03:37:28.068
MORE WE BRING THOSE UP TO BE TO

03:37:28.135 --> 03:37:29.269
BE NO SO THE STRUCTURES CAN BE.

03:37:29.336 --> 03:37:30.771
MORE HARD AND DID REALLY TO KEEP

03:37:30.837 --> 03:37:31.972
OUR PEOPLE SAFE TO KEEP OUR

03:37:32.038 --> 03:37:33.140
COMMUNITY SAFE TO KEEP OUR

03:37:33.206 --> 03:37:34.341
BUSINESS IS SAFE.

03:37:34.408 --> 03:37:36.309
AND SO TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT A

03:37:36.376 --> 03:37:38.612
PREVIOUS CODE IT'S TAKING.

03:37:38.678 --> 03:37:39.613
KNOWLEDGE THAT WE'VE GAINED

03:37:39.679 --> 03:37:41.214
SINCE ACT CODE WAS ADOPTED IN

03:37:41.281 --> 03:37:42.816
JUST REGARDING THAT ADVANCE OF

03:37:42.883 --> 03:37:44.317
KNOWLEDGE AND I THINK YOU KNOW

03:37:44.384 --> 03:37:44.951
IF YOU'RE.

03:37:45.018 --> 03:37:46.019
THE POINT TODAY I THINK IT IT'S

03:37:46.086 --> 03:37:48.989
YOU KNOW WE WE NEED TO ADVOCATE.

03:37:49.055 --> 03:37:49.489
FOR YOU KNOW THE MODERN

03:37:49.556 --> 03:37:51.091
STANDARDS WERE THERE YOU KNOW

03:37:51.158 --> 03:37:52.893
WHERE THERE COULD BE FLEXIBILITY

03:37:52.959 --> 03:37:54.194
I THINK WAS MENTIONED IS YOU

03:37:54.261 --> 03:37:55.695
KNOW MAYBE SOME OF THE THE

03:37:55.762 --> 03:37:57.864
ENERGY YOU KNOW COMPONENTS OF

03:37:57.931 --> 03:37:59.299
YOU KNOW OF THE ASPECT OF THE

03:37:59.366 --> 03:38:02.869
CODE WITH YOU KNOW WITH REGARD --

03:38:02.936 --> 03:38:03.804
TO WE KNOW THINGS WOULD MAKE

03:38:03.870 --> 03:38:05.372
THAT HOME MORE EFFICIENT I MEAN

03:38:05.439 --> 03:38:06.540
IF WE WERE LOOKING TO MAY TRY TO

03:38:06.606 --> 03:38:07.007
MAKE SOME CONSTRUCTION

03:38:07.073 --> 03:38:08.041
POTENTIALLY.

03:38:08.108 --> 03:38:11.678
LESS EXPENSIVE BUT I DON'T KNOW

03:38:11.745 --> 03:38:14.414
IF THAT'S THE DIRECTION THEN THE

03:38:14.481 --> 03:38:16.016
THEN THE LIFE SAFETY STANDARDS

03:38:16.082 --> 03:38:17.451
YEAH AND THAT'S THAT'S FOR I

03:38:17.517 --> 03:38:18.285
KNOW.

03:38:18.351 --> 03:38:19.886
OUR COMMITTEES BEEN FOCUSING ON

03:38:19.953 --> 03:38:21.621
A ARE THOSE LIKE SAFETY

03:38:21.688 --> 03:38:22.255
STANDARDS AND THERE'S SOME REAL

03:38:22.322 --> 03:38:23.590
CONCERN.

03:38:23.657 --> 03:38:25.492
PARTICULARLY WHAT WE KNOW NOW --

03:38:25.559 --> 03:38:27.227
IN WHAT WE SEEN ON THE GROUND

03:38:27.294 --> 03:38:29.830
WHY WE WOULD ALLOW LOCAL

03:38:29.896 --> 03:38:31.064
DISCRETION.

03:38:31.131 --> 03:38:32.933
IF WE KNOW THE CITY CENTERS ARE

03:38:32.999 --> 03:38:34.801
TRUE THE GOING TO SAVE LIVES

03:38:34.868 --> 03:38:35.702
THIS PRESIDENT THANK YOU WANT TO

03:38:35.769 --> 03:38:38.004
BE A SAYS.

03:38:38.071 --> 03:38:39.039
YES I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT AB.

03:38:39.105 --> 03:38:40.073
ALL THE STANDARDS THEY WERE

03:38:40.140 --> 03:38:41.208
LOOKING AT TODAY [inaudible]

03:38:41.274 --> 03:38:42.809
THERE.

03:38:42.876 --> 03:38:44.644
NOT ONLY ARE YOU LOOKING AT HOW

03:38:44.711 --> 03:38:45.645
YOU CAN MAKE YOUR SAFE

03:38:45.712 --> 03:38:47.347
COMMUNITIES SAFER IN YOUR

03:38:47.414 --> 03:38:48.949
RESIDENTS SAFER BUT THE

03:38:49.015 --> 03:38:51.451
FIREFIGHTERS AND THE POLICE NEED

03:38:51.518 --> 03:38:51.885
TO BUILD YOUR JOB.

03:38:51.952 --> 03:38:54.488
AND BY HAVING THESE PLANS

03:38:54.554 --> 03:38:56.189
IMPLEMENTED AND ENFORCED IT

03:38:56.256 --> 03:38:58.124
GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO

03:38:58.191 --> 03:39:01.061
AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE NOW WHEN-THE WINDS BLOWING SEVENTY EIGHTY

03:39:01.127 --> 03:39:02.295
MILES AN HOUR IT'S VERY

03:39:02.362 --> 03:39:03.029
DIFFICULT.

03:39:03.096 --> 03:39:05.632
BUT WHAT'S MORE DIFFICULT FOR US

03:39:05.699 --> 03:39:07.400
IS WHEN WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING

03:39:07.467 --> 03:39:09.402
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS AND

03:39:09.469 --> 03:39:12.272
EGRESS POINTS ON A ROAD.

03:39:12.339 --> 03:39:14.007
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FUEL.

03:39:14.074 --> 03:39:15.275
AROUND A HOUSE THAT'S BEEN

03:39:15.342 --> 03:39:17.744
ELIMINATED SO THAT WE CAN GO IN

03:39:17.811 --> 03:39:18.678
AND DO OUR JOB.

03:39:18.745 --> 03:39:20.514
AND SO WHAT I ASK IS THAT

03:39:20.580 --> 03:39:22.382
WHATEVER WE DO GOING FORWARD.

03:39:22.449 --> 03:39:23.183
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE

03:39:23.250 --> 03:39:24.718
COMMUNITY IN THE RESIDENCE IT'S

03:39:24.784 --> 03:39:26.419
ABOUT ALLOWING THIS THE

03:39:26.486 --> 03:39:27.921
FIREFIGHTERS IN OUR STATE POLICE

03:39:27.988 --> 03:39:30.323
OFFICERS ENTER STATE DO OUR JOB

03:39:30.390 --> 03:39:31.591
IN DOOM SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY.

03:39:31.658 --> 03:39:33.994
THANK YOU IS PRESENT.

03:39:34.060 --> 03:39:36.663
WHEN I GO TO KEEP IN MIND --

03:39:36.730 --> 03:39:39.165
YOU'VE SEEN IN YOUR CAREER --

03:39:39.232 --> 03:39:40.534
THE SEVERITY OF FIRE CHANGE

03:39:40.600 --> 03:39:42.502
SIGNIFICANTLY.

03:39:42.569 --> 03:39:44.004
ARE GOING FROM BAD TO WORSE.

03:39:44.070 --> 03:39:46.306
SO WHAT CONCERNS HAVE YOU DO YOU

03:39:46.373 --> 03:39:49.342
HAVE FROM WHERE YOU SEEN THE WAY

03:39:49.409 --> 03:39:51.144
THESE FIRES TO BURN.

03:39:51.211 --> 03:39:51.778
IN THE WAY COMMITTEES HAVE BEEN

03:39:51.845 --> 03:39:52.512
DEALT.

03:39:52.579 --> 03:39:53.680
ARE THAT WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF

03:39:53.747 --> 03:39:54.981
THESE COMMUNITIES IF NOT MORE

03:39:55.048 --> 03:39:56.216
ALL OVER THE STATE THAT ARE JUST

03:39:56.283 --> 03:39:57.851
WAITING TO BURN AND THE FACT

03:39:57.918 --> 03:39:59.286
THAT EVERY YEAR IN THE LAST FIVE

03:39:59.352 --> 03:40:00.520
YEARS IT CONTINUES TO GET WORSE

03:40:00.587 --> 03:40:02.355
JUST AS I THINK TIED OTHERS SAID

03:40:02.422 --> 03:40:03.990
HEY WE THOUGHT WE HAD A CAREER.

03:40:04.057 --> 03:40:05.458
FIRE WHEN WE WERE AT THE CEDAR

03:40:05.525 --> 03:40:07.260
FIRE IN TWO THOUSAND THREE EVERY

03:40:07.327 --> 03:40:08.895
YEAR SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN

03:40:08.962 --> 03:40:10.764
WE WERE SEEING CAREER FIRES AND

03:40:10.830 --> 03:40:12.899
THAT THAT'S WHAT CONCERNS ME THE

03:40:12.966 --> 03:40:13.266
MOST.

03:40:13.333 --> 03:40:14.501
WE HAVE ALL OF THIS AGAIN WE

03:40:14.568 --> 03:40:17.270
TALK ABOUT LEGACY.

03:40:17.337 --> 03:40:19.205
EVEN IF YOU FORGOT ABOUT THE NEW

03:40:19.272 --> 03:40:20.607
CONSTRUCTION IS WE HAVE A

03:40:20.674 --> 03:40:22.108
LIABILITY SITTING OUT THERE IN

03:40:22.175 --> 03:40:24.744
OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

03:40:24.811 --> 03:40:25.345
THOUSAND STRUCTURES HAVE IT'LL

03:40:25.412 --> 03:40:25.946
STRUCTURES.

03:40:26.012 --> 03:40:27.581
IN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY --

03:40:27.647 --> 03:40:29.516
ALONE THAT IS EVEN CONSIDER

03:40:29.583 --> 03:40:31.151
THESE OTHER AREAS WITHIN THE LRA.

03:40:31.217 --> 03:40:33.520
ALL OF THEM ARE VULNERABLE AND

03:40:33.587 --> 03:40:34.654
AS TIES WERE TO CONTINUE TO

03:40:34.721 --> 03:40:36.356
EXPOSE FIREFIGHTERS IN THE

03:40:36.423 --> 03:40:37.857
PUBLIC. TO THESE KIND OF

03:40:37.924 --> 03:40:40.260
CONDITIONS AND WE HAVE TO FIND A

03:40:40.327 --> 03:40:41.795
WAY TO TURN THE CORNER.

03:40:41.861 --> 03:40:43.229
I'M LOOKING BACK AND TAKING CARE

03:40:43.296 --> 03:40:45.665
OF WHAT WE'VE GOT NOW IN OWNING

03:40:45.732 --> 03:40:47.200
UP TO THE CHALLENGE.

03:40:47.267 --> 03:40:48.335
WHATEVER THAT MIGHT BE I'M ALL

03:40:48.401 --> 03:40:50.704
ABOUT INCENTIVES IN RE DIRECTING.

03:40:50.770 --> 03:40:52.439
HAZARD MITIGATION MONEY FROM

03:40:52.505 --> 03:40:53.306
FEMA RE DIRECTING AND I KNOW

03:40:53.373 --> 03:40:55.775
THAT FORTY FIVE DAY PLAN TALKS

03:40:55.842 --> 03:40:56.343
ABOUT LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN

03:40:56.409 --> 03:40:57.310
INVEST.

03:40:57.377 --> 03:40:59.412
IN SOME OF THESE RETROFITS WE

03:40:59.479 --> 03:41:00.947
HAVE TO FIND A PLAN --

03:41:01.014 --> 03:41:03.316
AND IT THERE MAY HAVE TO BE SOME

03:41:03.383 --> 03:41:06.720
TO THE FIREMAN'S. TO GET SOME OF

03:41:06.786 --> 03:41:08.088
THIS MONEY TO ENSURE THAT IT

03:41:08.154 --> 03:41:09.422
HAPPENS BUT WE'VE GOT TO FIND

03:41:09.489 --> 03:41:11.725
SOME WAYS. TO HELP HOMEOWNERS

03:41:11.791 --> 03:41:12.993
MAKE THESE CHANGES --

03:41:13.059 --> 03:41:14.628
SO THAT WE CAN START YOU KNOW

03:41:14.694 --> 03:41:15.996
IMPROVING BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

03:41:16.062 --> 03:41:18.231
BIRD THIS YEAR LAST YEAR TO FOR

03:41:18.298 --> 03:41:19.466
QUESTIONS ON THAT SO --

03:41:19.532 --> 03:41:21.568
WERE SEEN HOW FAR THOSE

03:41:21.635 --> 03:41:23.103
IMMERSIVE IMPLYING AND THAT'S

03:41:23.169 --> 03:41:25.238
WHAT'S BEEN CATCHING WE SAW THAT --

03:41:25.305 --> 03:41:28.141
IN PARADISE WE SAW THAT IN SANTA

03:41:28.208 --> 03:41:30.310
ROSA -- SO

03:41:30.377 --> 03:41:32.045
THE BEST WAY TO BE ABLE TO

03:41:32.112 --> 03:41:33.413
MITIGATE THAT HAS A WHAT THE

03:41:33.480 --> 03:41:34.614
MAYOR SAID IS THE SAME THING

03:41:34.681 --> 03:41:36.616
THAT WE SAW SANTA ROSA ONCE THAT

03:41:36.683 --> 03:41:38.018
THING GOT GOING.

03:41:38.084 --> 03:41:39.519
THERE'S NO STOPPING IT WITH THE

03:41:39.586 --> 03:41:40.754
EMBER CAST IS WHAT'S REALLY

03:41:40.820 --> 03:41:43.490
DRIVING THE OF THE INTERIOR

03:41:43.556 --> 03:41:45.025
BURNING OF THE COFFEE PARK.

03:41:45.091 --> 03:41:46.926
ALL OF YOU KNOW PARADISE REALLY

03:41:46.993 --> 03:41:48.595
BERNAMA'S FROM THE INSIDE OUT IF

03:41:48.662 --> 03:41:49.829
YOU WILL BECAUSE THAT WITHIN AN

03:41:49.896 --> 03:41:51.264
HOUR THE ONLY WERE EMBERS

03:41:51.331 --> 03:41:52.599
LANDING INSIDE.

03:41:52.666 --> 03:41:54.234
THE COMMUNITY AND SO I I THINK

03:41:54.300 --> 03:41:55.735
FOR OF THE GERMAN FROM VENTURA

03:41:55.802 --> 03:41:57.303
COUNTY EARLIER TALKED ABOUT IT

03:41:57.370 --> 03:41:59.773
WE SORT OF HAD THIS WE'VE

03:41:59.839 --> 03:42:01.141
HISTORICALLY HAD THIS PERIMETER.

03:42:01.207 --> 03:42:02.142
OF DEFENSE DISCUSSION AND

03:42:02.208 --> 03:42:03.309
THOUGHT PROCESS IF WE KEEP THE

03:42:03.376 --> 03:42:05.045
FIRE OUT OF THE EDGE OF TOWN

03:42:05.111 --> 03:42:06.279
WE'RE GOOD WELL IT'S THAT'S

03:42:06.346 --> 03:42:08.014
REALLY NOT THE CASE ANYMORE AND

03:42:08.081 --> 03:42:09.683
SO WE REALLY NEED TO BE.

03:42:09.749 --> 03:42:11.151
THINKING AND GOING INTERIOR

03:42:11.217 --> 03:42:12.686
SUBDIVISIONS AND COMMUNITIES

03:42:12.752 --> 03:42:13.887
THAT WE THINK.

03:42:13.953 --> 03:42:15.221
ARE NOT IN A WILDLAND FIRE

03:42:15.288 --> 03:42:16.623
ENVIRONMENT ARE BURNING BECAUSE

03:42:16.690 --> 03:42:17.857
OF ORNAMENTAL VEGETATION TO

03:42:17.924 --> 03:42:19.392
BRING BECAUSE OF BUILDING

03:42:19.459 --> 03:42:20.794
CONSTRUCTION --

03:42:20.860 --> 03:42:23.096
THERE WE JUST NEED TO LOOK AT

03:42:23.163 --> 03:42:24.764
HOW WE CAN PROTECT INSIDE COFFEE

03:42:24.831 --> 03:42:26.099
PARK IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE WE

03:42:26.166 --> 03:42:27.333
SHOULD NEVER NONE OF US EVER

03:42:27.400 --> 03:42:28.301
THOUGHT.

03:42:28.368 --> 03:42:29.836
THAT WOULD BURN ON THE OPPOSITE

03:42:29.903 --> 03:42:31.438
SIDE OF THE FREEWAY IN IN A

03:42:31.504 --> 03:42:33.139
DEVELOPED SUBDIVISION BUT WHEN

03:42:33.206 --> 03:42:34.574
WE STEP BACK AND LOOK.

03:42:34.641 --> 03:42:35.942
YOU KNOW IN THE EARLY NINETEEN

03:42:36.009 --> 03:42:37.077
SIXTIES THE HAMLEY FIRE ACTUALLY

03:42:37.143 --> 03:42:39.112
DID BURN THERE IT JUST LOOKED A

03:42:39.179 --> 03:42:39.946
LITTLE DIFFERENTLY AT THE TIME

03:42:40.013 --> 03:42:40.480
SO.

03:42:40.547 --> 03:42:41.281
THERE ARE SOME TOPOGRAPHICAL

03:42:41.347 --> 03:42:43.583
FEATURES AND OTHER THING

03:42:43.650 --> 03:42:45.085
INFLUENCED FIRE BEHAVIOR THERE

03:42:45.151 --> 03:42:47.854
AND SO WE NEED TO GO DEEPER.

03:42:47.921 --> 03:42:48.621
INTO WHAT WE WOULD NORMALLY

03:42:48.688 --> 03:42:50.790
CONSIDER TO BE URBAN AREAS AND

03:42:50.857 --> 03:42:52.225
AND DO SOME MORE ANALYSIS TO

03:42:52.292 --> 03:42:54.594
ENSURE BURKE CATCHING ALL OF

03:42:54.661 --> 03:42:56.096
THESE THESE FIRE PRONE AREAS.

03:42:56.162 --> 03:42:58.465
WE WE PUT A LOT OF WAY ON HAZARD

03:42:58.531 --> 03:42:59.365
MITIGATION DOLLARS.

03:42:59.432 --> 03:43:02.602
BUT THOSE ARE THE EASIEST TO BE

03:43:02.669 --> 03:43:03.770
TO DEAL WITH --

03:43:03.837 --> 03:43:04.904
THE AND IT HAPPENS AFTER

03:43:04.971 --> 03:43:08.174
INCIDENT ANY COULD HAPPEN --

03:43:08.241 --> 03:43:10.610
WERE STILL SEEN DOLLARS THEY

03:43:10.677 --> 03:43:12.545
HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED FROM TWO

03:43:12.612 --> 03:43:13.480
THOUSAND FIFTEEN IN THE VALLEY

03:43:13.546 --> 03:43:13.680
FIRE.

03:43:13.747 --> 03:43:15.582
SO.

03:43:15.648 --> 03:43:17.250
IS THAT REALLY A RELATED TO

03:43:17.317 --> 03:43:18.184
CHIEF DO YOU THINK THAT'S A

03:43:18.251 --> 03:43:19.919
REALISTIC APPROACH.

03:43:19.986 --> 03:43:21.020
WELL I THINK IF WE DON'T

03:43:21.087 --> 03:43:22.222
CONTINUES PURSUE THAT YOU KNOW

03:43:22.288 --> 03:43:23.923
WILL BE REMISS BUT NO IT'S NOT

03:43:23.990 --> 03:43:25.458
GOING TO BE THE ONLY SINGLE

03:43:25.525 --> 03:43:26.893
ANSWER WE CAN BE TO LOOK AT

03:43:26.960 --> 03:43:28.428
OTHER YOU KNOW FUNDING SOURCES.

03:43:28.495 --> 03:43:29.462
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST A

03:43:29.529 --> 03:43:30.964
GOVERNMENT PROBLEM EITHER I

03:43:31.030 --> 03:43:32.832
THINK WE NEED TO BE THINKING AND

03:43:32.899 --> 03:43:34.234
OTHER ENTREPRENEURIAL WAYS TO

03:43:34.300 --> 03:43:35.735
GET SOME OF THIS WORK.

03:43:35.802 --> 03:43:37.971
DONE AND I FOR THE INSURANCE

03:43:38.037 --> 03:43:38.872
INDUSTRY TALKED ABOUT TODAY AND

03:43:38.938 --> 03:43:40.807
OTHERS THIS IS IT ITIS GOING TO

03:43:40.874 --> 03:43:41.641
TAKE ALL.

03:43:41.708 --> 03:43:42.509
EFFORTS --

03:43:42.575 --> 03:43:43.943
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR

03:43:44.010 --> 03:43:46.045
FUNDING SOURCES AND INCENTIVES

03:43:46.112 --> 03:43:47.113
AND SOME REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE I

03:43:47.180 --> 03:43:48.581
WOULD OWN THESE HOMES HAVE SOME

03:43:48.648 --> 03:43:50.784
RESPONSIBILITY TOO BUT YOU JUST

03:43:50.850 --> 03:43:51.651
CAN'T EXPECT A HOMEOWNER TO COME

03:43:51.718 --> 03:43:54.087
IN AND WANT TO MAKE A TWENTY

03:43:54.154 --> 03:43:55.121
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR INVESTMENT

03:43:55.188 --> 03:43:56.890
IN THEIR HOME TODAY --

03:43:56.956 --> 03:43:58.091
TO MAKE IT FIRE SAFE I MEANS

03:43:58.158 --> 03:43:59.526
WE'VE GOT TO FIND WAYS TO

03:43:59.592 --> 03:44:00.894
INCENTIVIZE THAT AND IT'S GOING

03:44:00.960 --> 03:44:01.694
TO TAKE.

03:44:01.761 --> 03:44:05.031
ME A MULTIPLE SOURCES OF FUNDING

03:44:05.098 --> 03:44:05.899
VARIOUS LEVELS.

03:44:05.965 --> 03:44:10.537
THE AND COME BACK TO WHERE IS

03:44:10.603 --> 03:44:12.172
SINCE THIS IN THE PLANNING

03:44:12.238 --> 03:44:15.008
COMMUNITY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY

03:44:15.074 --> 03:44:16.309
WITH FIRE MARSHALS AS WELL --

03:44:16.376 --> 03:44:19.279
ON NOT ALLOWING FOR LOCAL

03:44:19.345 --> 03:44:24.017
DISCRETION WITHIN THE WILL HE

03:44:24.083 --> 03:44:26.686
IT'S A CLUSTER.

03:44:26.753 --> 03:44:27.687
WELL.

03:44:27.754 --> 03:44:29.022
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IN THE LAND

03:44:29.088 --> 03:44:30.557
USE PROCESS LIKE WHEN WHEN WE

03:44:30.623 --> 03:44:31.858
TALK ABOUT THE LOCAL HAS MAGIC

03:44:31.925 --> 03:44:33.126
MITIGATION PLAN.

03:44:33.193 --> 03:44:33.927
AND GETTING INTO THE GENERAL

03:44:33.993 --> 03:44:35.695
PLAN THAT'S WERE WE THEN ENGAGE

03:44:35.762 --> 03:44:37.397
WITH THE PUBLIC IN THE PUBLIC

03:44:37.463 --> 03:44:39.199
POLLS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRE AS

03:44:39.265 --> 03:44:40.466
WELL AS THE COMMUNITY.

03:44:40.533 --> 03:44:42.368
AND THAT'S WE HAVEREALLY HARD

03:44:42.435 --> 03:44:44.304
FOUGHT COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND WE

03:44:44.370 --> 03:44:46.306
IDENTIFY PRIORITIES AND GROWTH

03:44:46.372 --> 03:44:47.607
AREAS ALL THOSE.

03:44:47.674 --> 03:44:49.108
NO NO TRAIN WRECK BUT THEN IT

03:44:49.175 --> 03:44:49.943
BUILDING OFFICIALS DON'T WANT TO

03:44:50.009 --> 03:44:51.744
STAY DAY TO TAKE THAT DISCUSSION

03:44:51.811 --> 03:44:52.412
AWAY.

03:44:52.478 --> 03:44:54.013
AND IN SO FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE HAD

03:44:54.080 --> 03:44:55.582
CONVERSATIONS AND BILLS THAT

03:44:55.648 --> 03:44:57.717
HAVE MOVED IN THE PAST. TWENTY

03:44:57.784 --> 03:44:58.985
FOUR MONTHS --

03:44:59.052 --> 03:45:00.687
WE CAN'T --

03:45:00.753 --> 03:45:02.288
IN AGAIN NOT AT ALL FROM DOESN'T

03:45:02.355 --> 03:45:03.323
OFFICIALS ANY THE BUS BECAUSE

03:45:03.389 --> 03:45:04.357
THEY'RE FANTASTIC.

03:45:04.424 --> 03:45:06.893
AND I JUST LIKE THE LEGISLATURE --

03:45:06.960 --> 03:45:12.565
A LOT OF OPINIONS I IN ANY TIME.

03:45:12.632 --> 03:45:16.736
THERE SIGNIFICAN CERTAIN SO --

03:45:16.803 --> 03:45:18.271
HOW DO WE DRIVE THAT?

03:45:18.338 --> 03:45:19.939
AND AND I APPRECIATE AND

03:45:20.006 --> 03:45:22.208
POIGNANT SPONSOR AND THANK YOU

03:45:22.275 --> 03:45:23.509
I'M NOT A BUILDING OFFICIAL SO

03:45:23.576 --> 03:45:24.244
IT'S OKAY NO I AM.

03:45:24.310 --> 03:45:26.312
BUT BUT IT'S TRUE LIKE WITHIN

03:45:26.379 --> 03:45:27.714
WITHIN YOUR SHOP THOUGH YEAH

03:45:27.780 --> 03:45:29.015
RIGHT.

03:45:29.082 --> 03:45:31.184
YOUR FOLKS ARE SAYING THAT THERE

03:45:31.251 --> 03:45:34.120
ARE SOME THAT WILL SAY WELL IT

03:45:34.187 --> 03:45:35.688
SHOULD BE UP TO LOCALS.

03:45:35.755 --> 03:45:37.056
I IN SOME THAT SAY AS YOU JUST

03:45:37.123 --> 03:45:38.191
SAID IS WE NEED TO BE TAKEN

03:45:38.258 --> 03:45:39.993
THOSE NEW STANDARDS WHAT WE JUST

03:45:40.059 --> 03:45:41.694
HEARD FROM THE CHIEF AND FROM

03:45:41.761 --> 03:45:42.495
THE PRESIDENT.

03:45:42.562 --> 03:45:44.364
SO HOW DO WE DRIVE CONSENSUS WE

03:45:44.430 --> 03:45:44.964
KNOW THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO

03:45:45.031 --> 03:45:46.499
DO.

03:45:46.566 --> 03:45:49.168
WELL TOUGH QUESTION I THINK THAT

03:45:49.235 --> 03:45:51.604
THE THE GENERALLY SPEAKING YOUR

03:45:51.671 --> 03:45:52.238
BUILDING OFFICIALS ARE GOING TO

03:45:52.305 --> 03:45:53.640
BE HARD.

03:45:53.706 --> 03:45:55.475
ADVOCATES FOR A TOUGH BUILDING

03:45:55.541 --> 03:45:57.744
CODE AND I THINK IT'S ONLY AS

03:45:57.810 --> 03:45:59.646
THE THE PRESSURE COMES ON THEM

03:45:59.712 --> 03:46:01.481
INDIVIDUALLY LIKE CASE BY CASE

03:46:01.547 --> 03:46:02.982
WERE YOU SEE THEN THOSE.

03:46:03.049 --> 03:46:04.150
TOUGH DISCUSSIONS HAPPEN ON THE

03:46:04.217 --> 03:46:06.052
LOCAL LEVEL OF ALLOWANCES AND

03:46:06.119 --> 03:46:08.187
THINGS LIKE THAT SO I THINK THAT

03:46:08.254 --> 03:46:09.756
GENERALLY SPEAKING THERE THEY'RE

03:46:09.822 --> 03:46:11.257
NOT THE PROBLEM THEY'RE NOT IN

03:46:11.324 --> 03:46:14.594
THE WAY OF IN FORCING A TOUGH

03:46:14.661 --> 03:46:16.729
BUILDING CODE.

03:46:16.796 --> 03:46:19.599
WE HAD SOME CHALLENGES BUT OKAY

03:46:19.666 --> 03:46:20.700
BUT I'M GONNA SAY THAT AND I

03:46:20.767 --> 03:46:21.701
KNOW THAT ISN'T THAT WERE

03:46:21.768 --> 03:46:22.702
INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT THIS

03:46:22.769 --> 03:46:23.903
YEAR BECAUSE I LOOK.

03:46:23.970 --> 03:46:24.971
IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE LOW

03:46:25.038 --> 03:46:27.106
HANGING FRUIT THE NO BRAINER

03:46:27.173 --> 03:46:29.309
THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL THAT WE

03:46:29.375 --> 03:46:30.777
SHOULD BE ALLOWING

03:46:30.843 --> 03:46:32.745
RECONSTRUCTION AT A LESSER

03:46:32.812 --> 03:46:34.113
STANDARD ESPECIALLY WHEN IT

03:46:34.180 --> 03:46:35.281
COMES A WHOLE HOME HARDENING.

03:46:35.348 --> 03:46:37.116
I AGREE TO CHIEF THERE MAY BE

03:46:37.183 --> 03:46:41.354
SOME THE FLEXIBLE ON BUT WHEN IT

03:46:41.421 --> 03:46:42.789
COMES TO MAKING YOUR HOME MORE

03:46:42.855 --> 03:46:44.357
RESILIENT ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE

03:46:44.424 --> 03:46:45.959
IN THE WILL HE WHY ARE WE EVEN

03:46:46.025 --> 03:46:47.060
HAVING THIS DEBATE.

03:46:47.126 --> 03:46:48.528
CHIEF IT JUST JUST TO CLARIFY

03:46:48.594 --> 03:46:49.963
THAT.

03:46:50.029 --> 03:46:51.931
THE STATE ADOPTED CODE LOCALS

03:46:51.998 --> 03:46:54.133
CAN ONLY BE MORE STRINGENT WE

03:46:54.200 --> 03:46:56.502
CAN'T BE LESS STRINGENT SO WE

03:46:56.569 --> 03:46:58.104
CAN'T BE MORE LENIENT WE CAN

03:46:58.171 --> 03:46:59.238
DISREGARD.

03:46:59.305 --> 03:47:01.074
WHAT THE STATE CODE SAYS WE NEED

03:47:01.140 --> 03:47:02.775
TO DO WITH THE PROVISION THERE

03:47:02.842 --> 03:47:04.177
IS A PROVISION IN THE CODE TO

03:47:04.243 --> 03:47:05.778
GIVES US A LITTLE BIT DISCRETION

03:47:05.845 --> 03:47:07.213
IS CALLED ALTERNATIVE MEANS AND

03:47:07.280 --> 03:47:08.214
METHODS?

03:47:08.281 --> 03:47:09.215
BUT THAT NEEDS TO BE

03:47:09.282 --> 03:47:11.351
DEMONSTRATED THAT WHAT YOU'RE

03:47:11.417 --> 03:47:13.553
GOING TO DO MAYBE TWO LAYERS OF

03:47:13.619 --> 03:47:15.221
SHEET ROCK ON A WALL TO INCREASE

03:47:15.288 --> 03:47:16.956
THE FIRE RATING IN A PARTICULAR

03:47:17.023 --> 03:47:18.057
ROOM WELL THAT'S FOR NEW

03:47:18.124 --> 03:47:19.192
CONSTRUCTION FOR FOR

03:47:19.258 --> 03:47:20.526
RECONSTRUCTION YOU CAN GO BACK

03:47:20.593 --> 03:47:21.694
THOUGH IT WHAT RICANS WILL THE

03:47:21.761 --> 03:47:22.695
DISCOUNT WE HAVE.

03:47:22.762 --> 03:47:24.430
IS EXISTING NON CONFORMING I WE

03:47:24.497 --> 03:47:25.498
HAVE A LOT OF THAT ALL OF OUR

03:47:25.565 --> 03:47:27.000

03:47:27.066 --> 03:47:28.835
IT WAS A COMPLIANT WITH IT WELL

03:47:28.901 --> 03:47:29.669
WE WOULD HOPE LET'S LET'S GO

03:47:29.736 --> 03:47:31.304
WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE THE

03:47:31.371 --> 03:47:32.638
HOME WAS BUILT OVER THE

03:47:32.705 --> 03:47:34.540
DOCUMENTS HE WAS BUILT. TO THE

03:47:34.607 --> 03:47:36.642
CODE THAT EXISTED THE TIME THE

03:47:36.709 --> 03:47:39.078
PERMIT WAS PULLED AND SO IF THAT

03:47:39.145 --> 03:47:40.113
BUILDING HAS NOT GONE THROUGH A

03:47:40.179 --> 03:47:42.015
TENANT IMPROVEMENT OR REMODEL A

03:47:42.081 --> 03:47:45.818
NEW PERMIT PULLED SINCE.

03:47:45.885 --> 03:47:46.319
NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE IT

03:47:46.386 --> 03:47:48.921
COMPLIES WITH WHATEVER NINETEEN

03:47:48.988 --> 03:47:51.290
SEVENTY TWO CODE THAT EXISTED

03:47:51.357 --> 03:47:52.025
THERE NOT SPRING CLEARED DO YOU

03:47:52.091 --> 03:47:54.127

MAYBE SOME OF THE INCENTIVE

03:47:59.132 --> 03:48:00.066
PROGRAMS AND SOME OF THE

03:48:00.133 --> 03:48:01.334
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE'VE

03:48:01.401 --> 03:48:02.835
TALKED ABOUT ESPECIALLY FOR THAT

03:48:02.902 --> 03:48:04.804
STUFF IN THE IN THE WE WE AND AS

03:48:04.871 --> 03:48:09.042
FAR MOTION ORGAN POINT OUT THE

03:48:09.108 --> 03:48:12.045
V. ESTIMATED TO DO GRANT PRO SO

03:48:12.111 --> 03:48:14.080
THAT TO CREATE. TO GET THOSE

03:48:14.147 --> 03:48:17.617
THEIR VOCAL BECAUSE WE DON'T

03:48:17.683 --> 03:48:19.352
HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO GO BACK IN

03:48:19.419 --> 03:48:21.120

RETROACTIVE ENFORCEMENT.

03:48:22.789 --> 03:48:25.291
OF OF OF A MORE MODERN CODE --

03:48:25.358 --> 03:48:26.225
ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE A COULD

03:48:26.292 --> 03:48:27.627
CERTAINLY BE HELPFUL IN SUMMER

03:48:27.693 --> 03:48:29.028
GARDEN IN THAT'S BEEN SOME OF

03:48:29.095 --> 03:48:29.962
THE DEBATE THAT WE'VE HAD IT

03:48:30.029 --> 03:48:32.031
WITHIN OUR COMMITTEE CAN SOME

03:48:32.098 --> 03:48:33.132

03:48:40.606 --> 03:48:41.941
COMMITTEES MORE SO I THINK WORK

03:48:42.008 --> 03:48:44.777
TO KIDA NIBBLING AT IS THAT YOU

A KITCHEN CAN WE REQUIRE THEM TO

03:48:49.115 --> 03:48:50.817
PUT ON BETTER COVERS OR EVEN

03:48:50.883 --> 03:48:52.685
COVERS AND RIGHT NOW NO IS THE

03:48:52.752 --> 03:48:54.220
ANSWER UNLESS THERE WAS

03:48:54.287 --> 03:48:55.521
LEGISLATION.

03:48:55.588 --> 03:48:58.391

03:48:58.458 --> 03:48:59.759
THAT AS ONE IS ONE OF THE

03:48:59.826 --> 03:49:01.260
STRATEGIES ONE OF THE TOOLS AND

03:49:01.327 --> 03:49:02.795
TOOL BELT TO MAKE CALIFORNIA

03:49:02.862 --> 03:49:04.864
MORE SAFE FROM FIRE SAY

HE WAS JUST IT'S ALMOST THREE

03:49:10.036 --> 03:49:11.871
QUESTION BACK BUT IT'S THE

03:49:11.938 --> 03:49:13.873
CONCERNED IT'S IT'S IT MAKES NO

03:49:13.940 --> 03:49:15.575
IT IT'S A NO BRAINER TO ME TO DO

03:49:15.641 --> 03:49:17.276
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WHY

03:49:17.343 --> 03:49:19.278

03:49:19.345 --> 03:49:20.880
SHE WOULD OFTEN TALKED ABOUT WE

03:49:20.947 --> 03:49:22.248
WANT THERE. TO REASON THE CODES

03:49:22.315 --> 03:49:23.683
ARE UPDATED BECAUSE WE LEARNED

03:49:23.749 --> 03:49:25.451
WHAT ISN'T WORKING WILL LEARN

03:49:25.518 --> 03:49:27.019
FROM THESE FIRES AFTER THE

03:49:27.086 --> 03:49:28.488
DAMAGE IS NOT WHAT WE NEED TO DO

03:49:28.554 --> 03:49:30.490
IN THE FUTURE TO MAKE CHANGES.

03:49:30.556 --> 03:49:32.091
YOU KNOW THAT PART I DON'T THINK

03:49:32.158 --> 03:49:35.027

GO BACK OUT TO THESE COMMUNITIES

03:49:36.395 --> 03:49:37.497
BECAUSE THESE KINDS OF LAWS AND

03:49:37.563 --> 03:49:38.798
ORDINANCES CAN BE VERY MUCH

03:49:38.865 --> 03:49:41.400
ARTICULATED AS SLOW GROWTH --

03:49:41.467 --> 03:49:41.901
LOW GROWTH THEIR GROWTH

03:49:41.968 --> 03:49:43.636

IT'S GOING TO COST TWICE AS MUCH

03:49:49.609 --> 03:49:51.043
MONEY TO REBUILD.

03:49:51.110 --> 03:49:52.278
