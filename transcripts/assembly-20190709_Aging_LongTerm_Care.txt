LET ME JUST THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT SB SIX ELEVEN WHICH ESTABLISHES THE HOUSING OLDER PERSONS EFFECTIVELY OR HOPE TASK FORCE. AS PART OF THE STATE'S MASTER PLAN FOR AGING WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT -- WE HAVE WE FACE A TSUNAMI OF SENIORS COMING UP IN THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS. OF THE DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT WILL IMPACT ALL AREAS OF SERVICES -- THE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM ESPECIALLY HOUSING. WE'RE ALL AWARE THAT THE HOW OF THE HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE BUT IT'S GOING EVEN IT ACTUALLY HAS TAKEN A GREATER TOLL ON ARE OVER SIXTY FIVE POPULATION THE FASTEST GROWING -- HOMELESS CATEGORY IS THE OVER SIXTY FIVE SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT PEOPLE HAVING WORKED SPENT THEIR ENTIRE LIFE LIVING IN CALIFORNIA WORKING AND SUPPORTING THE ECONOMY AND THEN TO END UP HOMELESS AFTER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE IT'S IT'S PRETTY HEARTRENDING. ACCORDING TO THE UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH MORE THAN HALF OF LOW INCOME OLDER TENANTS ARE SEVERELY RENT BURDENED SPENDING MORE THAN 50% OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING. THE DISPARITY BETWEEN HOUSING COSTS AND INCOMES IS LEADING TO A RISE IN HOMELESSNESS AMONG OUR OLDER ADULTS. AS POLICYMAKERS DEVELOP SOLUTIONS TO CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS CRISIS GOING TO BE. IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND ITS IMPACT ON OLDER ADULTS. THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE MULTIPLE CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS INCREASED FRAILTY AND LIMITED MOBILITY AND THE NEED FOR IN HOME SERVICES TO MEET THEIR NEEDS AND REALLY THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT IS TO START. TO TO STUDY AND UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED -- AS WE LOOK AT THE ALTERNATIVES THAT WE HAD RIGHT HAVE RIGHT NOW THAT ARE TOTALLY INADEQUATE. AS PART OF THE MASTER PLAN PLAN PROCESS THE HOPE TASK FORCE WILL CONVENE STAKEHOLDERS FROM AROUND THE STATE. TO IDENTIFY POLICY TO HELP OLDER ADULTS AND THOSE WITH DISABILITIES AGE IN PLACE. AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTEGRATE THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES TO PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES. AND TO DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES TO DEVELOP INTER GENERATIONAL HOUSING THAT INCLUDES SERVICES AND SUPPORT FOR A MATURE POPULATION. SO ABOUT WITH ME AS CASE YOUR CONNOR FROM THE STATE TREASURER ON A MAS OFFICE WHO IS A CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND MEGAN ROSE ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE. LEADING AGE CALIFORNIA ALSO A CO SPONSOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR THIS THOSE. ENJOYABLE -- DO PASS AND A SUPPORT SUPPORT FROM BOTH SIDES AND YOU HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. SHARKS THEN I'LL KEEP THIS BRIEF GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE CASE YOUR CAR LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR STATE TREASURER FEE ON A MOCK. I'LL JUST SAY THIS ISSUE IS PERSONAL FOR HER SHE'S HAD BOTH HER PARENTS LIVING WITH HER AND SHE'S BEEN TAKING CARE OF THEM HER MOTHER RECENTLY PASSED AWAY DURING. HER CAMPAIGN AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THE RESOURCES WERE NOT AVAILABLE OR THERE WAS NO STREAMLINED FASHION TO FIGURE OUT WAS ACCESSIBLE. AND SHE'S ONE OF THE HIGHEST RANKING MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA SO IF IT'S HARD FOR HER TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM HOW HARD IS IT GOING TO BE. FOR FOLKS WITHOUT THE RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES THAT WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL SO WE VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS WE THANK THE SENATOR AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR WORKING ON A MASTER PLAN. THAT IS REALLY COMPREHENSIVE WE SEE HOUSING IS A BIG PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE WANT TO FIX AND ALTERNATES TIME OVER TO MEGAN THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MEGAN ROSE WITH LEADING AGE CALIFORNIA WE NEED CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS OVER FOUR HUNDRED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WHO PROVIDE. HEALTH CARE SOCIAL SERVICES AND HOUSING TO OUR OLDER ADULTS OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OLDER ADULTS. AND I THINK THE MAIN THING THAT I WOULD LOVE FOR ALL OF YOU TO TAKE AWAY AS IS THIS ISN'T JUST A BILL ABOUT HOUSING. I WHEN WE TALK TO OLDER ADULTS AND HOUSING WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AS PART OF OUR LONG TERM CARE SYSTEM BECAUSE FOR SENIORS IT REALLY. IS A HOUSING IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT TO PROVIDING HEALTH AND LONG TERM CARE TO OUR OLDER ADULTS AND THIS BILL SEEKS TO BREAK DOWN THE SILOS THAT EXISTS BETWEEN ALL OF OUR GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT WORK WITH OUR OLDER ADULTS. AND BRING THEM TO THE TABLE HAVE THEM START COMMUNICATING TOGETHER SO WE CAN REALLY MODERNIZE AND MAKE OUR SYSTEMS MORE NIMBLE AND MORE ADAPTABLE TO THIS GROWING POPULATION OF OLDER ADULTS AND THAT CARE AND SERVICES THAT THEY WILL NEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR PRESENTATION -- ANYBODY ELSE IN SUPPORT. FAMOUS CHAIRMAN KEEP THE ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA PURPOSES ATION ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. STEPHANIE SAY WITH THE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. AMYLIN MATHIS WITH THE U. D. W. ASKED ME LOCAL THIRTY NINE THIRTY IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. I CAN'T EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE AREA AGENCY ON AGING SANTA CRUZ AND SAN BENITO COUNTY. SPEAKING IN SUPPORT ALSO JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A SEPARATE TASK FORCE TO LOOK AT THIS IT'S FAR TOO BIG AND TOO COMPLEX OF AN ISSUE. TO JUST HAVE A FOLD IN WITH OTHER EFFORT SO WE REALLY THANK ARE THE AUTHORS OF THE BILL AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. OKAY I WITNESSES AND AGAINST AGAINST. NO ANYONE ANYONE MANY SPEAKERS AGAINST. ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MR LACKEY YET JUST REAL QUICKLY CERTAINLY WE ALL ARE VERY MUCH AWARE. OF THE THE AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING PROBLEM AND THE SHORTAGE OF HOUSING AND SO YOU'RE TO BE COMMENDED FOR BRINGING THIS LEGISLATION. HAVE FORCED A TAXI VOTE ON BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION I KNOW THAT. ARE GOVERNOR'S CREATE AT LEAST FIVE TASK FORCES. IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS AND WE JUST LIKE TO KNOW HOW THIS WOULD ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE MASTER PLAN. AND HELD THE FUNDED. SO IT IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE MAT IT'S VERY SPECIFIC ON HOUSING IN IN IN PARTICULAR HOUSING AND THE RELATED SERVICES THAT ARE GOING TO BE NEEDED -- OR SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN ASSIST THE SENIORS TO AGE IN PLACE. AND AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT IN A WAY THAT THAT. ALLOWS INDEPENDENT LIVING WHEN THEY WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT AND THEN TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE SERVICES -- COME IN AND PROVIDE PROVIDE THEM THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN THEIR OWN HOMES OR TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN IT KIND OF AN INDEPENDENT LIVING. ARRANGEMENT RATHER THAN LIVING IN. RATHER THAN BEING FORCED TO LIVE IN -- ASSISTED LIVING SITUATION WHICH IS A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE AND SO THAT THE GOAL HERE IS TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE PIECES THAT WE NEED TO INVEST IN. AND YEAH I MEAN THAT'S IT SURE I WOULD UP IF YOU DON'T MIND SOME OVER I'M HAPPY TO ADD THAT WE BELIEVE THE TREASURER'S OFFICE THAT THE MASTER PLAN. IS AN ITERATIVE PROCESS SO WALL WE ARE VERY MUCH ON BOARD WITH THE THE GOVERNOR'S GOALS OF HAVING A FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED BY OCTOBER FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY WE THINK WHEN THE MEN ARE MASTER PLAN WHEN OUR TASK FORCE COMES BACK WITH THE SPECIFIED AGENDA WE'VE GIVEN THEM TO LOOK AT AGING IN PLACE -- ELDER -- ADULTS ARE LOOKING AT BECOMING WHOLE ARE ABOUT TO BECOME HOMELESS OR ALREADY HOMELESS WE PUT OUT A LIST OF SPECIFIED OBJECTIVES FOR OUR TASK FORCE TO ME AND WE BELIEVE THAT ONCE OUR TASK FORCE COMES BACK. THEY CAN BE WORKED INTO THE GREATER MASTER PLAN BECAUSE A MASTER PLANS ARE GREAT FRAMEWORK BUT YOU REALLY NUTS AND BOLTS TO HOLD IT TOGETHER WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE -- IS PART OF THAT PROCESS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE WITH THIS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS [inaudible] THIS RACE. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR FOR BRINGING THIS -- I THINK THE OUR STATE TREASURER ALSO WITH A VERY PERSONAL STORY. I DO APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE MASTER PLAN BUT YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOUSING AND VERY SPECIFICALLY THE NEEDS OF HOUSING OF OUR SENIORS AND THE DIGNITY -- OF STAYING AT HOME THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE VERY SPECIFIC TO OUR SENIORS IS NOT JUST HOMELESSNESS IN GENERAL IT'S FOR OUR SENIORS SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU YOU HAVE -- PRESENTED THAT. THIS TO US SO THAT IN THE END THE THE THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING DOES HAVE A SPECIFIC INCLUSION OF THIS SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE. GREAT THIS DOESN'T YEAH I ENJOYED TO PASSED THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THE SENATOR -- YEAR AFTER YEAR WITH HOMELESS COUNTS WE ALSO SEE THAT THE FASTEST GROWING SUBSET OF THE HOMES POPULATION IS AMONG SENIORS.

OF GETTING THE THRESHOLD IN SO HE COULD QUITE SIMPLY JUST DROP IT OFF OR WE CAN AT LEAST SAYS A LOOKS LIKE AT LEAST IN RECENT. OUR RECENT HISTORY HAS BEEN TO WHO OF THE TENTATIVE. FUNDED TO TO OUR BUDGET PROCESS BUT IT DOESN'T HURT THAT WHATEVER WE GET TO THE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS HELPED OFFSET. WHAT WE HAVE TO GET FROM OUR BUDGET AND THIS PAST YEAR LOOKS LIKE NINETY ONE THOUSAND WAS THE MOST -- THAT TO THE FUNDED GOTTEN THE THE VCF FOR THE LEGISLATURE GOT AND A WHILE AND THE REALITY IS LEGISLATURE. DOES THAT MAKE UP LEGISLATURE ARE ADVOCATES. ALL YEAR LONG UP THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND SO I THINK IT'S A IT'S A PRETTY GOOD USE OF OUR RESOURCES. TO NOT JUST FUNDED BUT TO ALSO KEEP IT ON THE TO ON THE LIST AND SO DOES THAT CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT INTEREST MAYBE CAN FIND WAYS MARKET A LITTLE BIT MORE SO THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND -- BUT THEY LOOK AT THE OPTIONS WITH THE CAN SHOULD BE TO THAT SPEAK AND BOOST THAT NUMBER OF NINETY ONE THOUSAND SO UP CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE MEASURE AND START EVEN WILL BECAUSE OF UP TO TO SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISS REYES. THANK YOU HI THERE WE HAD THAT DURING OUR BUDGET SUB ONE WE HAD A GREAT ADVOCATE. THAT INSISTED THAT WE PUT SOME MONEY IN THE BUDGET FOR THIS PROGRAM ALSO HAS THE SAME LAST NAME -- AND SHE WAS SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THE THE FUNDING IN THE STATE BUDGET [inaudible] ONGOING FUNDING. THANK YOU FOR THE CORRECTION -- ONGOING FUNDING WHICH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN ADVOCATE TO SAY THAT IT'S NECESSARY IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN -- I DO HAVE A QUESTION. WHY THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD WHY WAS THAT PUT IN? WIND UP THIS CSL ORIGINALLY STOOD UP [inaudible] OF AB. THIRTEEN EIGHTY SIX BY AGNOS IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE DID NOT ESTABLISH ANY THRESHOLD IN FACT THE ORIGINAL INTENT WAS. THAT WE WOULD BE CONTINUOUSLY. FUNDED REMAINING ON THE TAX CHECK OFF IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES THERE WAS THE INTRODUCTION OF A MINIMUM -- IT WAS PRETTY MUCH ESTABLISHED ACROSS THE BOARD ARE ROB. POINT IS THAT. WE FELT IN DO FEEL THAT WE SHOULD BE RULED BY WHAT WAS THE ORIGINAL INTENT. OF THE LEGISLATION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE WITH THIRTEEN EIGHTY SIX AND THAT IT WAS INTENDED TO FIND ADVOCACY EFFORTS OF WHICH THE ANNUAL SESSION LEGISLATOR VISITS FROM THAT KIND OF THING -- FALL UNDER HIM THAT WE WE WOULD REMAIN REGARDLESS. OF A MINIMUM ON THAT PHONE INDEFINITELY SOMETHING CHANGED. IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES TO CHANGE THE THINKING ON THAT WE DON'T AGREE WITH. WITH THAT OBVIOUSLY BUT WE WANTED TO BRING THAT UP TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THE RITUAL INTENT WAS THAT WE HAD NO MINIMUM REMAINED ON THE FUN INDEFINITELY. THANK YOU IN IF I MAY -- MISTER CHAIR. IT IS IT A QUESTION OF THE COST OF MAINTAINING THE FUND OPEN. IS THAT THE ISSUE DO YOU KNOW OF I DON'T KNOW BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH. THE FUNDS FOR THE VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS COME RIGHT OFF THE TOP. OUT OF THE EIGHTY EIGHT FIFTEEN MONIES OKAY SO I'M NOT SURE THAT WOULD REALLY. BE -- AN ISSUE -- AND I WOULD BE SPECULATING IN TERMS OF WHY THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CAME INTO WHY THAT. THRESHOLD WAS ESTABLISHED VERSUS ANOTHER NUMBER A HUNDRED THOUSAND OR FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOWEVER -- YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THERE WERE OVER THIRTY FUN ALMOST THIRTY FUNDS NOW ON THE TAX CHECK OFF AND SOME OF THOSE ARE MADE IN THE MINIMUM AND SOME OF THOSE ARE NOT.

SUPPORT SERVICES THEY NEED -- IT DOES SO BY SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING AGING DISABILITY RESOURCE CONNECTION PROGRAMS. INCREASING THE QUALITY OF SERVICES THEY PROVIDE. AND ENCOURAGING THE EXPANSION OF EIGHTY R. C. PROGRAMS AND TAKEN STEPS TOWARDS CALIFORNIA BECOMING A NO WRONG DOOR STATE. OF A NO RUN OUR STATE IS A SYSTEM THAT ENABLES CONSUMERS TO ACCESS ALL LONG TERM SOCIAL SERVICES OPTIONS THROUGH AN AGENCY ORGANIZATION. COORDINATED WORKER PORTAL IT'S THROUGH THE A. D. R. C. PROGRAMS THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE CONNECTED TO SUPPORT SERVICES NEEDED TO KEEP THEM SAFELY LEAVING LIVING IN THEIR HOME -- TO EXPAND ACCESS TO THESE -- CRITICAL SERVICES THE EIGHTY RC PROGRAMS PROVIDE AS BEFORE FIVE THREE CREATES THE ADR C. INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM -- WHICH WAS -- FUNDED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR. AND THIS PROGRAM ONE SURE THAT MORE CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THEY NEED AND TODAY HAVE VICTORIA JUMP FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF AREA AGENCIES ON AGING HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK -- I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND HOW TRUE PARTNERSHIP AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS TRANSFORMING THE TO THE COMMUNITY AND TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE HI MY 100% BELIEVE IN THE EIGHTY R. C. MODEL. AND THE NO WRONG DOOR MODEL AND SEE THEM AS A COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO PROVIDING A COORDINATED SYSTEM OF INFORMATION AND ACCESS FOR ALL PERSONS SEEKING LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. I'VE BEEN THE DIRECTOR OF INTER COUNTY AREA AGENCY ON AGING SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR AND I KNEW OF THE INDEPENDENT LIVING RESOURCE CENTER IN OUR COUNTY. THE PROVIDE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES BUT REALLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY DID -- OUR INTERACTIONS WERE VERY LIMITED WE SAW EACH OTHER OCCASIONALLY EVERYTHING WAS VERY STYLE LOADWE DIDN'T SHARE ANY CLIENTS IF YOU HAD AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY WENT TO THEM. IF YOU NEEDED MEALS OR IN HOME SERVICES YOU WENT TO ME -- AND REALLY THIS MODEL PLAYS OUT DAILY IN MOST COUNTIES IT IS VERY STYLISH. WE RECOGNIZE THAT TOO MANY PEOPLE WERE COMING THROUGH OUR DOORS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN TO TAKE UP A LOT OF TIME -- BECAUSE THEY NEVER GOT WHAT THEY NEEDED THE FIRST TIME THEY CAME TO US. I'M WITH THE UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH IN THE POPULATION WE KNEW THAT WE HAD TO DO BETTER FOR OUR COMMUNITY. SO IN. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE INDEPENDENT LIVING RESOURCE CENTER DIRECTOR AND I SAT DOWN TO DISCUSS WITH A PARTNERSHIP WOULD LOOK LIKE -- AND WE APPLIED FOR DESIGNATION WITH THE STATE -- AND NOW HAVE A SEAMLESS PARTNERSHIP WHICH TRULY IN NO WRONG DOOR MODEL I'M AN OLDER SHARE WE KNOW ONE STORY ABOUT THE MAGIC OF THE PARTNERSHIP AND WHAT IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE AND HOW IT WORKS. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WE HAVE A SOCIAL WORKER WITH OUR AREA AGENCY ON AGING THAT'S EMBEDDED IN PUBLIC HOUSING THAT WORKS WITH PEOPLE OF ALL AGES THAT ARE HIGHER RISK OF INFECTION -- BECAUSE OF BEHAVIORAL ISSUES AND OTHER FACTORS SO IF YOU LIVE IN PUBLIC HOUSING YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE RULES. IF YOU DON'T THEN YOU KNOW YOUR CHANCES OF BEING EVICTED ARE VERY HIGH SO WE HAVE A SOCIAL WORKER THERE TO PREVENT IT. SO ONE DAY WE RECEIVED A REFERRAL FOR A WOMAN THAT ALL COLD JONES -- AND HER TEENAGE SON BILLY SHE HAD RECEIVED A THREE DAY OF ACTION NOTICE FOR PUBLIC HOUSING. BECAUSE OUR SON BILLY WAS OUT OF CONTROL IT HAD SET A FIRE IN THE BUILDING -- IT WAS FURTHER DISCOVER THE BILLION ATTEMPTED SUICIDE MULTIPLE TIMES AND WAS THREATENING TO KILL HIMSELF AGAIN SO PUBLIC HOUSING THREE DAYS WE'RE GOING TO GO. LIMITED OPTIONS -- HE ALSO STOPPED GOING TO SCHOOL AS WELL SOURCE SOCIAL WORKER CALLED IN THE ASSISTANCE FROM THE INDEPENDENT LIVING RESOURCE CENTER BECAUSE WE ARE AN EIGHTY OR SEE WE HAVE THAT PARTNERSHIP AND WE KNOW WHAT EACH OTHER DOES. SO WE WERE ABLE TO CALL IN THEIR TEAM AND COME UP WITH A PLAN TO PREVENT THE EVICTION AND GET THE FAMILY. THE HELP THAT THEY NEEDED -- A HOMELESS MENTALLY ILL MOM WITH A SUICIDAL TEENAGE SON WOULD HAVE BEEN A TERRIBLE OUTCOME WHICH WE WANTED TO AVOID. SO THEY WORKED WITH BILLY WE WORK WITH JOAN WELL THE INDEPENDENTLY LIVING RESOURCE CENTER WORKED WITH BILLY. IN ADDITION TO HIM NOT GOING TO SCHOOL IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT HE ACTUALLY HAD AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY AND WASN'T CONNECTED TO ANY OF THE SERVICES SO THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT MEMBERS OF OR ANY OF OUR SYSTEM SO THESE ARE NEW PEOPLE TO US FOR WHATEVER REASON -- IT HAPPENS. EVENTUALLY BE DID CONNECT HIM WITH SERVICES WORKING TOGETHER HE WENT BACK TO SCHOOL THE FAMILY GOT THE HELP THAT THEY NEEDED. AND WE WERE ABLE TO KEEP THEM IN PUBLIC HOUSING AND PREVENT THE ACTUAL ADDICTION THIS WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED. YOU KNOW FIVE SIX SEVEN YEARS AGO IN MY COUNTY THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN EVICTED AND WHO KNOWS WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO THE FAMILY -- SO NEED IS NEAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT PEOPLE'S NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE WHEN THEY COME TO US. AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR SYSTEM IS IN PLACE WERE SOME COULD COME INTO THE SYSTEM MULTIPLE WAYS. THROUGH A HOUSING COORDINATOR THROUGH AN INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE LINE. UP AND BE CONNECTED QUICKLY AND SEAMLESSLY TO WHAT PEOPLE NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT AND I BELIEVE THAT AB R. C. AS PART OF THAT SYSTEM. AND SO I ENCOURAGE YOU. TO SUPPORT THIS.
