00:13:47.226 --> 00:13:49.461
WE FORMED A ROOF WE WERE IT WAS

00:13:49.528 --> 00:13:51.297
SO CLOSE TO ACTUALLY DOING

00:13:51.363 --> 00:13:52.965
SOMETHING JUST BECAUSE WE

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:54.200
WANTED TO HELP THOSE WHEN. THEY

00:13:58.037 --> 00:14:01.574
OF THE DAY MISTER CHAIR. OF WE

00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:04.310
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN FEES

00:14:04.376 --> 00:14:06.979
AND COSTS BY CONVERTING AND I

00:14:07.046 --> 00:14:09.381
AND SETTING UP OWN BANK BUT- WE

00:14:09.448 --> 00:14:10.416
FOUND OUT THAT THE FEDERAL

00:14:10.482 --> 00:14:12.885
GOVERNMENT REIMBURSES 80% OF.

00:14:12.952 --> 00:14:14.353

THERE'S A CHANCE THAT THERE

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:45.784
COULD BE LOSSES IN THERE FOR

00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:47.419

TODAY IN TODAY'S CONVERSATION-

00:22:51.103 --> 00:22:51.937

OUR ARE STILL BEING MADE AND I

00:23:18.563 --> 00:23:19.097
THINK THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:20.832
THAT I THINK WE NEED TO CHANGE

00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:22.634
THAT WE DO OF THE BANKING

00:23:22.701 --> 00:23:24.603

THE CORE GROUP THAT HAS TO BE A

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.414
PUBLIC INTEREST AND WE'VE SEEN

00:23:36.481 --> 00:23:38.617

00:23:38.683 --> 00:23:40.919
TURN A BLIND GUY- ON ON ON THE

00:23:40.986 --> 00:23:44.356
NEAT. TO HAVE A TO REENTER. A

00:23:44.422 --> 00:23:46.491

OTHERS. THIS LAST YEAR'S

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:46.918
CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT THE

00:29:46.985 --> 00:29:47.919
POSSIBILITY OF LOCAL PUBLIC

00:29:47.986 --> 00:29:50.221
BANKS. TODAY'S CONVERSATION IS

00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:51.756
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE

00:29:51.823 --> 00:29:55.460
VISION OF A STATE. A STATE

00:29:55.527 --> 00:29:56.694
OTHER BANK THAT KEEP THE PEOPLE

00:29:56.761 --> 00:29:59.731
BY NASH POWER. IN OUR STATE TO

00:29:59.797 --> 00:30:01.432
ENSURE THAT WE ARE JUMP

00:30:01.499 --> 00:30:02.433
STARTING OUR STATE'S ECONOMIC

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.202
RECOVERY. TO CATALYZE THE

00:30:04.269 --> 00:30:06.971
DEVELOPMENT OF. LOCAL FINANCIAL

00:30:07.038 --> 00:30:08.773
INSTITUTIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:09.908
PROVIDING INFRASTRUCTURE

00:30:09.974 --> 00:30:12.243
CAPITAL AND SUPPORT. WE DON'T

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.211
KNOW THAT'S FAR RECOVERY

00:30:13.278 --> 00:30:14.979
EFFORTS HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY THE

00:30:15.046 --> 00:30:16.814
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT CHOSE

00:30:16.881 --> 00:30:18.917
TO USE AS INTERMEDIARIES. THE

00:30:18.983 --> 00:30:19.851
WORLD'S LARGEST COMMERCIAL

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:21.653
BANKS. THESE RECOVERY EFFORTS

00:30:21.719 --> 00:30:22.887
THAT HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY

00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:24.789
INADEQUATE. I WOULD SUGGEST

00:30:24.856 --> 00:30:26.157
THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:30:26.224 --> 00:30:27.392
ESTABLISH THIS YEAR SOMETHING

00:30:27.458 --> 00:30:30.061
THAT BILLS ARE WORKING HISTORY

00:30:30.128 --> 00:30:32.230
OUR EXISTING AYE BANK. AYE AND

00:30:32.297 --> 00:30:33.131
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WITHOUT A

00:30:33.198 --> 00:30:34.599
STATE PUBLIC BANK OU STATE

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:36.201
WILL CONTINUE TO BE DEPENDENT

00:30:36.267 --> 00:30:38.536
ON OUTSIDE FOR PROFIT ACTORS.

00:30:38.603 --> 00:30:39.737
AND WILL BE CHALLENGING

00:30:39.804 --> 00:30:44.108
INSURING THE LONG TERM. AND

00:30:44.175 --> 00:30:44.676
ACCOUNTABLE AND SUSTAINABLE

00:30:44.742 --> 00:30:45.743
RECOVERY. THE VISION OF PUBLIC

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:46.377
BANKING IS TO PROVIDE

00:30:46.444 --> 00:30:47.579
INVESTMENT IN FINANCIAL

00:30:47.645 --> 00:30:49.214
INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROMOTE THE

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.583
PUBLIC GOOD. PUBLIC GOODS- THAT

00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:53.017
INVOLVED DEVELOPING STANDARDS

00:30:53.084 --> 00:30:54.586
TO PREVENT DISCRIMINATION IN

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:56.554
OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKET.

00:30:56.621 --> 00:30:58.089
ENSURING THAT WORKERS AND

00:30:58.156 --> 00:30:59.591
BUSINESSES BENEFIT FROM THE

00:30:59.657 --> 00:31:02.060
VALUE OF THEIR WORK. WE ALSO

00:31:02.126 --> 00:31:03.261
BELIEVE THAT THE STATE PUBLIC

00:31:03.328 --> 00:31:05.563
BANK I WOULD GO BEYOND ECONOMIC

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:06.965
RECOVERY THIS IS AN INVESTMENT

00:31:07.031 --> 00:31:10.134
TO CREATE A LEGACY OF LONG TERM

00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:11.469
FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY FOR OUR

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:13.271
STATE. CREATION OF A BANK WOULD

00:31:13.338 --> 00:31:14.505
BE THE FIRST STEP TO CREATE A

00:31:14.572 --> 00:31:16.474
SHARED INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE

00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:17.809
DEGREE BETWEEN LOCAL

00:31:17.875 --> 00:31:20.812
JURISDICTIONS AND OUR STUDENTS.

00:31:20.878 --> 00:31:22.814
AS MR SANTIAGO ROUTED TO THE

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.549
BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA HAS BEEN A

00:31:24.616 --> 00:31:26.317
CLEAR EXAMPLE IN THIS AREA.

00:31:26.384 --> 00:31:27.885
THEIR BANK HAS CONSISTENTLY

00:31:27.952 --> 00:31:29.520
DELIVERED DOUBLE DIGIT RETURNS

00:31:29.587 --> 00:31:31.556
IN EQUITY TO THEIR STATE EVEN

00:31:31.623 --> 00:31:33.291
DURING THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

00:31:33.358 --> 00:31:35.193
FINANCIAL CRISIS. THIS YEAR THE

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:35.960
BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA

00:31:36.027 --> 00:31:37.629
FACILITATED NORTH DAKOTA HAVING

00:31:37.695 --> 00:31:39.264
THE LARGEST P. P. P. LOAN

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:40.999
FUNDING FOR WORKFORCE IN THE

00:31:41.065 --> 00:31:42.834
COUNTRY. HELPING TO GET THOSE

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.069
LOANS TO THE BUSINESSES THAT

00:31:45.136 --> 00:31:45.603
NEED THEM THE MOST THROUGH

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:47.705
COMMUNITY LENDERS. WE ALSO KNOW

00:31:47.772 --> 00:31:49.507
THAT STATE PUBLIC BANKS WOULD

00:31:49.574 --> 00:31:51.342
BRING REVENUES AND PROFITS TO

00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:52.744
RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.245
LIKE THAT REPRESENT BIBLE

00:31:54.312 --> 00:31:57.215
BANKING MARKETS THAT ARE OFTEN

00:31:57.282 --> 00:31:58.549
IGNORED BY WALL STREET. NOW I

00:31:58.616 --> 00:32:00.952
KNOW WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME

00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:02.453
THIS PAST YEAR TO GET THE

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.921
DETAILS RIGHT AND THAT I WOULD

00:32:03.988 --> 00:32:05.690
SUGGEST IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:06.891
THING THAT WE COULD BE ENGAGING

00:32:06.958 --> 00:32:09.294
RIGHT. I REALLY APPRECIATE. THE

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.595
FACT THAT I THINK THERE'S A LOT

00:32:10.662 --> 00:32:12.297
OF SHARED VISION ON HOW WE DO

00:32:12.363 --> 00:32:13.798
THIS BUT AS WE KNOW THE DEVIL'S

00:32:13.865 --> 00:32:15.900
IN THE DETAIL AND THAT'S

00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:16.534
ENGAGEMENT THEY WERE HOPING TO

00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:18.336
HAVE TODAY. CHAIRMAN REQUIRE

00:32:18.403 --> 00:32:20.204
TALKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGE OF

00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:21.839
DOING THIS DURING THIS PANDEMIC

00:32:21.906 --> 00:32:22.940
IN RECESSION WHICH I GREATLY

00:32:23.007 --> 00:32:24.809
APPRECIATE. WHAT I SUGGEST

00:32:24.876 --> 00:32:26.511
THOUGH IS THAT WE ALSO FOCUS ON

00:32:26.577 --> 00:32:28.546
THE CHALLENGES OF NOT MOVING ON

00:32:28.613 --> 00:32:30.615
THIS DURING THIS TIME. AS WE

00:32:30.682 --> 00:32:31.649
ARE HOPING AND PRAYING FOR A

00:32:31.716 --> 00:32:34.152
SPEEDY AND FAIR RECOVERY. I

00:32:34.218 --> 00:32:35.386
THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT OUR

00:32:35.453 --> 00:32:36.421
COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN CRYING

00:32:36.487 --> 00:32:38.122
OUT FOR HELP. FROM THE LARGEST

00:32:38.189 --> 00:32:39.090
BANKS IN AMERICA AND

00:32:39.157 --> 00:32:42.427
UNFORTUNATELY THAT HELP HAS NOT

00:32:42.493 --> 00:32:43.628
YET COME. ONE FINAL OBSERVATION

00:32:43.695 --> 00:32:45.563
ON OUR WEB VICE CHAIR MORLOCK

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.098
APPRECIATE YOUR PARTICIPATION

00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:49.801
WAS HEARING THAT. AND I KNOW WE

00:32:49.867 --> 00:32:50.835
ALWAYS HAD HEALTHY DEBATES ON

00:32:50.902 --> 00:32:52.570
THESE ISSUES AND ALWAYS HELP.

00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:54.706
TO ENSURE THAT WHATEVER WE DO-

00:32:54.772 --> 00:32:55.973
WE ARE MOVING FORWARD THE BEST

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.810
POLICIES AND HE REFERRED TO THE

00:32:58.876 --> 00:33:00.478
PRIVATE BANK THAT. I WOULD NOTE

00:33:00.545 --> 00:33:01.546
THAT THE BILL THAT WE MOVED

00:33:01.612 --> 00:33:03.348
LAST YEAR PUT IN SO MANY

00:33:03.414 --> 00:33:04.716
REQUIREMENTS FOR LOCAL PUBLIC

00:33:04.782 --> 00:33:06.984
BANKING FROM OUR FRIENDS NOW

00:33:07.051 --> 00:33:09.187
SEES PUBLIC SCRUTINY. THE

00:33:09.253 --> 00:33:11.255
APPROVAL REQUIRES FOR ANY

00:33:11.322 --> 00:33:12.256
PRIVATE SECTOR FINANCIAL

00:33:12.323 --> 00:33:14.025
INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING FDIC

00:33:14.092 --> 00:33:15.860
DEPOSIT INSURANCE COLLATERAL

00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:17.528
REQUIREMENTS EXAGGERATE. THAT

00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:19.364
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IT WILL BE

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:20.598
VERY DIFFICULT FOR LOCAL

00:33:20.665 --> 00:33:22.266
JURISDICTIONS TO MEET THESE

00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:23.568
REQUIREMENTS. AND I DO

00:33:23.634 --> 00:33:25.269
APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE THAT

00:33:25.336 --> 00:33:26.371
THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS THAT

00:33:26.437 --> 00:33:27.505
THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN DO

00:33:27.572 --> 00:33:29.207
BETTER THAN THE PUBLIC SECTOR.

00:33:29.273 --> 00:33:31.609
BUT IN THIS FIELD OF BANKING

00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:32.677
THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE SERVING

00:33:32.744 --> 00:33:34.278
THE PUBLIC. YOU LOOK AT THE

00:33:34.345 --> 00:33:36.114
MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE CRISIS THE

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.749
STUDENT LENDING CRISIS THE

00:33:37.815 --> 00:33:40.051
PREDATORY CONSUMER LOAN CRISIS

00:33:40.118 --> 00:33:42.086
THE FAILURE OF BANKING SERVICES

00:33:42.153 --> 00:33:43.054
FOR MILLIONS OF SMALL

00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:44.021
BUSINESSES DURING THIS

00:33:44.088 --> 00:33:45.356
RECESSION. THE LACK OF

00:33:45.423 --> 00:33:47.125
INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:33:47.191 --> 00:33:48.626
AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THE

00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:50.395
LARGEST BANKS IN THE WORLD IN

00:33:50.461 --> 00:33:52.397

ALLEGEDLY THAT HAVE BEEN MAKING

00:33:54.031 --> 00:33:55.800
UP. FAKE BANK ACCOUNTS THAT

00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:57.535
HAVE BEEN INVESTING IN THE GUN

00:33:58.269 --> 00:34:00.605
INDUSTRY BAD LABOR PRACTICES

00:34:00.671 --> 00:34:01.973

UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FROM ET.

00:34:06.677 --> 00:34:07.345
WE NEED TO LOOK AT REAL

00:34:07.412 --> 00:34:09.480
ALTERNATIVES SO WITH THAT AGAIN

00:34:09.547 --> 00:34:10.548

AND SO- THINGS THAT I THINK WE

00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:23.467
SHOULD BE ALL THINKING ABOUT AS

00:38:23.534 --> 00:38:24.735
YOU HAVE IN THE BANK AN

00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:26.337
INFRASTRUCTURE BANK THAT HAS

00:38:26.404 --> 00:38:27.838
BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR TWENTY

00:38:27.905 --> 00:38:30.341
FIVE YEARS. WHAT YOU'RE ABLE TO

00:38:30.408 --> 00:38:32.977

00:38:33.044 --> 00:38:34.578
AND EXPAND ITS ROLE AND EXPAND

00:38:34.645 --> 00:38:36.947

DEFICIT AND DEFICITS COULD

00:38:47.258 --> 00:38:49.860

THE MARKETS AND PAYING A HIGHER

00:38:58.302 --> 00:38:59.704

RATE SCOTT IN STATE LEVEL WAR

00:39:06.677 --> 00:39:07.611
SHOULD THE STATE PROVIDE THOSE

00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:09.513
DOLLARS AT A LOWER RATE STILL

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.515

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:20.891
CUT STAFF CAN WE LEARN TO SEE

00:39:20.958 --> 00:39:22.860
THE ADVISING COMMUNITY BANKS TO

PROVIDES PRIVATE SECTOR BANKS

00:39:55.559 --> 00:39:57.428

KNOW THE FED STEPPED IN TO PUMP

00:41:32.256 --> 00:41:33.257
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE

00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:34.825
SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY- BUT

00:41:34.892 --> 00:41:35.993
IT WOULD AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.528
CHIU REFERENCE IT WAS VASTLY

00:41:37.595 --> 00:41:39.797
UNEVEN. MEANT MOSTLY IT WAS

00:41:39.864 --> 00:41:41.131
MEDIUM TO LARGER BUSINESSES

00:41:41.198 --> 00:41:42.433
THEY GOT THE MAJORITY OF THOSE

00:41:42.499 --> 00:41:44.435
BECAUSE IT WAS BUILT ON TOP OF

00:41:44.501 --> 00:41:46.270
THE EXISTING STRUCTURE. OF HOW

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:47.705
SMALL BUSINESSES ACCESS IS

00:41:47.771 --> 00:41:49.974
CAPITAL- AND IT'S- PRIMARILY

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.375
THROUGH BANKING RELATIONSHIPS

00:41:51.442 --> 00:41:53.143
WITH MANY OF THE VERY SMALL

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:54.645
BUSINESSES. SIMPLY DIDN'T HAVE

00:41:54.712 --> 00:41:55.980
AND WE KNOW FROM SOME OF OUR

00:41:56.046 --> 00:41:57.581
SURVEYS THAT EVEN NOW AS WE

00:41:57.648 --> 00:41:58.782
LOOK FORWARD IN THE COMING

00:41:58.849 --> 00:42:01.085
MONTHS. I ROUGHLY 40% OF

00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:02.753
ENTREPRENEURS OF COLOR I'M

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:03.654
AREN'T QUITE SURE THEY'RE GOING

00:42:03.721 --> 00:42:05.890
TO MAKE IT. INTO TWENTY TWENTY

00:42:05.956 --> 00:42:07.224
ONE AND BEYOND- AND THAT THE

00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:08.893
KEY PIECE HERE IS THAT

00:42:08.959 --> 00:42:10.794
FUNDAMENTALLY HOW ARE CAPITAL

00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:12.630
MARKETS ARE BUILT FOR THE VERY

00:42:12.696 --> 00:42:15.099
SMALL BUSINESSES. IT DOESN'T

00:42:15.165 --> 00:42:16.734
WORK IT'S NOT BUILT FOR THAT.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.902
AND SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT

00:42:17.968 --> 00:42:19.136
HOW DO WE BUILD BETTER MARKET

00:42:19.203 --> 00:42:20.804
PLACE THAT ACTUALLY MEETS THE

00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:22.273
NEEDS OF THE VERY SMALL

00:42:22.339 --> 00:42:23.774

00:42:27.144 --> 00:42:28.412
ATTITUDE THE VITALITY OF OUR

00:42:28.479 --> 00:42:30.714
NEIGHBORHOODS- AND FINALLY WE

00:42:30.781 --> 00:42:31.448
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE.

00:42:31.515 --> 00:42:35.986
DE. RISKING CAPITAL IT CAN BE A

00:42:36.053 --> 00:42:37.087
EXPENSIVE A MAKE ONE. TO REAL

00:42:37.154 --> 00:42:37.988

MISALIGNED OF PURPOSES AND

00:59:52.322 --> 00:59:52.956
COULD LEAD TO EVEN HIGHER

BORROWING COSTS FOR THE STATE

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:56.059

ILLIQUID INVESTMENTS. AND I.

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:03.066
JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY

01:00:03.132 --> 01:00:04.500
SOMETHING BECAUSE I KNOW WE'VE

01:00:04.567 --> 01:00:05.435
BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:07.637
BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA. AND JOBS

01:00:07.704 --> 01:00:09.205
FROM ONE LAST POINT ASIDE FROM

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:12.308
SKILLS. ADDING TO THIS POINT-

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:13.309
YEAH I THINK WHAT WE EACH

01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:14.544
OTHER. WITH THOSE OF THE

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:15.878
FOUNDING PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH

01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:17.714
THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA I WAS

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:20.116
ESTABLISH AD. WHICH STIPULATED

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:21.384
THAT THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:23.019
ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:24.988
LOCAL BANKS NOT OFFER A

01:00:25.054 --> 01:00:27.457
COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVE. AND SO

01:00:27.523 --> 01:00:29.359
I'M LIKE WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED

01:00:29.425 --> 01:00:32.261
IN THE OF LEGISLATION BEFORE US

01:00:32.328 --> 01:00:33.396

SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS OR

01:00:36.165 --> 01:00:38.434
BUSINESSES- INSTEAD A LOCAL

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:40.236
BANK MUST APPLY TO ACCESS ONE

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:41.371
OF THEIR LENDING PROGRAMS ON

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:43.006
BEHALF OF THE CUSTOMER. BECAUSE

01:00:43.072 --> 01:00:44.474
IT RECOGNIZES LOCAL BANKS

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.708
UNDERSTAND THE COMMUNITIES THEY

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:50.179
SERVE. BETTER THAN A STATE

01:00:50.246 --> 01:00:51.114
ENTITY BECAUSE- AND BEYOND THE-

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:52.448
RED OF THE FOR FROM THE- AIDS

01:00:52.515 --> 01:00:53.483
AS A STATE BANK COULD BE

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:54.484
SUBJECT TO CHALLENGE FOR

01:01:29.986 --> 01:01:31.154
ALL THE DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE

01:23:34.075 --> 01:23:37.045
HISTORY. THE LAST TIME THAT

THIS GAINS TRACTION THAT

01:23:39.547 --> 01:23:40.215
CALIFORNIA WAS THE LATE

01:23:40.281 --> 01:23:44.386
SEVENTIES. I STATE BANK. IT WAS

01:23:44.452 --> 01:23:45.754
LOOKED AT AT THE TIME IS YOUR

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:48.556
CURIOSITY. BUT THEN NOT IS A

01:23:48.623 --> 01:23:51.559
GOOD IDEA. AND IT DID NOT

01:23:51.626 --> 01:23:57.832
ADVANCE. I. I AM REMINDED THAT

01:23:57.899 --> 01:24:01.002
WE ARE TRYING HERE TO REINVENT

01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:03.538
THE WHEEL. AND IS THAT

01:24:03.605 --> 01:24:06.608
NECESSARY I THINK NOT EDT IT

01:24:06.674 --> 01:24:09.844
WAS MENTIONED. EARLIE IN THIS

01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:12.447
TESTIMONY TODAY IF THERE'S ANY

01:24:12.514 --> 01:24:13.948
AGENCY OF GOVERNMENT THAT DOES

01:24:14.015 --> 01:24:18.153
NOT WORK. IT CDD NOW THERE ARE

01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:20.088
MANY WHO DO NOT WORK TO THOSE

01:24:20.155 --> 01:24:22.023
WHO PUT THEIR CONFIDENCE IN ALL

01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:24.259
OF THE ANSWERS BEING A STATE

01:24:24.325 --> 01:24:27.061
ENTITY IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE

01:24:27.128 --> 01:24:29.764
A STATE BANK. THAT IS FRAUGHT

01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:32.200
WITH GREAT DANGER. EDIT

01:24:32.267 --> 01:24:35.236
SUBJECTS THE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:24:35.303 --> 01:24:36.438
BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT THE

01:24:36.504 --> 01:24:41.109
EXECUTIVE BRANCH IF YOU WILL.

01:24:41.176 --> 01:24:44.779
TO A ROLL OF LEGISLATION KNOW

01:24:44.846 --> 01:24:47.248
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT. A BIG PART

01:24:47.315 --> 01:24:50.852
OF THIS. EARLIER AFTER THE

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:53.721
STATE BANK WAS TOUTING SOCIALLY

01:24:53.788 --> 01:24:57.792
CONSCIOUS INVESTING. THAT IS

01:24:57.859 --> 01:24:59.894
RISKY BUSINESS TO SAY THE LEAST.

01:24:59.961 --> 01:25:03.498
ANYONE WILL ATTEST TO THAT. IF

01:25:03.565 --> 01:25:05.166
WE'RE GOING TO DO POLICY THEN

01:25:05.233 --> 01:25:06.134
LET'S DO IT THROUGH THE

01:25:06.201 --> 01:25:08.403
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WHICH IS

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:10.738
MUCH MORE DELIBERATE PROCESS IN

01:25:10.805 --> 01:25:12.340
SETTING UP AN AGENCY OF

01:25:12.407 --> 01:25:14.776
GOVERNMENT WHO GUIDED

01:25:14.843 --> 01:25:20.482
ADMINISTRATIVELY. MERELY BY THE

01:25:20.548 --> 01:25:22.083
ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS

01:25:22.150 --> 01:25:24.385
EARLY SUBJECT TO THE

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:26.488
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT

01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:28.122
BUT THAT SHE GET FROM JACK'S

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:31.993
THE CITIZENS TO GREAT. GREAT

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:36.564
POLICY AND ECONOMIC RISK.

01:25:36.631 --> 01:25:39.834
CALIFORNIA IS A NO GOOD

01:25:39.901 --> 01:25:41.936
POSITION TO BE PROBLEMS MANY

01:25:42.003 --> 01:25:45.240
THANKS. WE ARE TOUTED TO BE FOR

01:25:45.306 --> 01:25:47.041
EXAMPLE THE HIGH TECH CAPITAL

01:25:47.108 --> 01:25:50.245
OF THE WORLD. AND ALMOST NONE

01:25:50.311 --> 01:25:52.981
OF THESE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR

01:25:53.047 --> 01:25:55.984
HI TECH PROJECTS. IT BRACED BY

01:25:56.050 --> 01:25:57.752
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE

01:25:57.819 --> 01:26:01.756
COME IN ON TIME. NOR ON BUDGET.

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:05.293
IT'S BEEN A HUGE EMBARRASSED.

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:06.995
AND ALL THE STATE HAS DONE IS

01:26:07.061 --> 01:26:10.064
TREATED AGENCIES SUPPOSEDLY TO.

01:26:10.131 --> 01:26:11.833
STRAIGHTENED THE MESS OUT IT'S

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:14.035
BEEN AROUND I THINK SIX YEARS

01:26:14.102 --> 01:26:16.437
SEVEN MAYBE EVEN EIGHT YEARS.

01:26:16.504 --> 01:26:17.272
AND ALL IT'S MOSTLY

01:26:17.338 --> 01:26:19.040
ACCOMPLISHED IS TO CHANGE ITS

01:26:19.107 --> 01:26:23.545
NAME. TWO OR THREE TIMES. IF

01:26:23.611 --> 01:26:24.913
CALIFORNIA CANNOT GET CHECKED

01:26:24.979 --> 01:26:27.181
RIGHTS. THAT'S A PRETTY SAD

01:26:27.248 --> 01:26:31.352
STATE. THANK YOU MY POINT IS IT

01:26:31.419 --> 01:26:34.856
BE WARY TO PUT A LOT OF TRUST.

01:26:34.923 --> 01:26:39.260
IN OUR FUTURE AND BANKING IN A

01:26:39.327 --> 01:26:42.764
QUOTE STATE BANK. AND EVEN

01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:46.167
MENTION NORTH DAKOTA. AS

01:26:46.234 --> 01:26:48.136
RELATIVE TO AN ARGUMENT OR

01:26:48.202 --> 01:26:49.771
SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN

01:26:49.837 --> 01:26:52.140
CALIFORNIA IS LUDICROUS. THERE

01:26:52.206 --> 01:26:55.643
IS NO COMPARISON. AND I WOULD

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:57.745
ARGUE THAT NORTH DAKOTA IS

01:26:57.812 --> 01:26:59.547
DEFICIENT SYSTEM IN THE SOUTH

01:26:59.614 --> 01:27:02.216
BUT THAT SAID IT IS MINUSCULE

01:27:02.283 --> 01:27:04.185
COMPARED TO THE COMPLEXITIES IN

01:27:04.252 --> 01:27:06.354
THE MAGNITUDE OF WHAT WE'RE

01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:08.523
DOING HERE CALIFORNIA. SO WHEN

01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:11.192
WE GET EXCITED ABOUT THE

01:27:11.259 --> 01:27:12.961
GENERAL WE'RE GONNA. SO WE CAN

01:27:13.027 --> 01:27:16.564
STILL HARM. PARDON WE'RE JUST

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:17.699
GONNA SHOULD YOU EVER QUESTION

01:27:17.765 --> 01:27:18.900
SO WE CAN STAY ON TIME WE'RE

01:27:18.967 --> 01:27:20.435

NOT I WAS MAKING AN OBSERVATION

01:27:25.239 --> 01:27:26.240
BUT I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE AN

01:27:26.307 --> 01:27:27.775
APPROPRIATE TIME FOR THAT

01:27:27.842 --> 01:27:29.477
OBSERVATION THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:30.712
INDULGENCE I MAY HAVE SOME

01:27:30.778 --> 01:27:32.280
COMMENTS I WILL COME BACK TO

01:27:32.347 --> 01:27:33.781
YOU FOR SURE I SEE I HAVE

01:27:33.848 --> 01:27:35.416
SENATOR CAFIERO WOULD QUESTION

01:27:35.483 --> 01:27:38.219
AND THEN I WILL GO TO SENATOR

01:27:38.286 --> 01:27:43.024

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:43.992
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER

01:27:44.058 --> 01:27:46.094
CHAIR I ATE I DON'T HAVE A

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:46.794
QUESTION I JUST WANT TO SAY

01:27:46.861 --> 01:27:49.097
THAT I AM. THIS IS REALLY BEEN

01:27:49.163 --> 01:27:50.865
A GREAT HEARING AND HAVE.

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:54.802
HAVING SUCH TALENT. AND AND

01:27:54.869 --> 01:27:57.538
EXPERTISE. IN ALL OF THE

01:27:57.605 --> 01:27:59.607
WITNESS THIS IS- IS REALLY

01:27:59.674 --> 01:28:01.376
INCREDIBLE AND I AND I SAY THAT

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:04.245
BECAUSE- I- I THINK THERE ARE

01:28:04.312 --> 01:28:06.648
REALLY GOOD ALTRUISTIC REASONS

01:28:06.714 --> 01:28:08.483
FOR HAVING A STATE BANK. BUT I

01:28:08.549 --> 01:28:10.718
ALSO FEEL JUST AS STRONGLY THAT

01:28:10.785 --> 01:28:12.520
IT'S ALWAYS FRAUGHT WITH DANGER

01:28:12.587 --> 01:28:14.722
WHEN THE STATE OR GOVERNMENT

01:28:14.789 --> 01:28:16.257
WALKS INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

01:28:16.324 --> 01:28:18.760
ARENA AND SAYS WE THINK WE CAN

01:28:18.826 --> 01:28:21.362
DO A BETTER JOB OF IT THAN YOU-

01:28:21.429 --> 01:28:23.164
OR WE HAVE A DIFFERENT GOAL IN

01:28:23.231 --> 01:28:25.433
MIND BY DOING IT OUR WAY AND-

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:26.968
I. I WAS INVOLVED IN THE

01:28:27.035 --> 01:28:29.704
BEGINNING OF A BANK. AND I'VE

01:28:29.771 --> 01:28:32.507
SEEN THE STRUGGLES. AND MAKING

01:28:32.573 --> 01:28:35.109
DECISIONS AND CHOICES-

01:28:35.176 --> 01:28:35.743
THANKFULLY THE BANK STILL

01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:38.413
EXISTS BUT- WE SET IT UP TO BE

01:28:38.479 --> 01:28:40.214
AN ALTRUISTIC BANK AND IN THE

01:28:40.281 --> 01:28:41.783
END I THINK. IT WAS VERY

01:28:41.849 --> 01:28:44.118
DIFFICULT TO GET THERE- FOR

01:28:44.185 --> 01:28:45.853
SOME REAL PRACTICAL FINANCIAL

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.955
REASONS AND SO IF A PRIVATE

01:28:48.022 --> 01:28:49.123
INDUSTRY BANK HAS A HARD TIME

01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:51.392
OF IT- THEN WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE

01:28:51.459 --> 01:28:53.428
OUT WHAT. WHAT THE SOLUTION IS

01:28:53.494 --> 01:28:54.262
I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU

01:28:54.328 --> 01:28:56.197
REALLY- I'M INCREDIBLY

01:28:56.264 --> 01:28:59.100
IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND- AND-

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:00.668
THIS IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY I

01:29:00.735 --> 01:29:01.736
THINK THEY'LL CONTINUE TO BE A

01:29:01.803 --> 01:29:02.670
DISCUSSION BUT THERE ARE SOME

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:05.673
LESSONS LEARNED. I THINK THAT-

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:07.842
THAT THAT WE'LL SEE IN- IN THE

01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:10.144
MUNICIPAL BANKING. ARENA SO

01:29:10.211 --> 01:29:10.945
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THAT'S

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:15.516

UNEXCEPTIONAL DORADO. THANK YOU-

01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:19.887
MISTER- NOT A QUESTION BUT JUST

01:29:19.954 --> 01:29:20.888
MAYBE IN SOME OTHER WAY WE

01:29:20.955 --> 01:29:22.757
COULD ADDRESS THIS I UNDERSTAND

01:29:22.824 --> 01:29:24.859
THAT- THE CURRENT LEGISLATIVE

01:29:24.926 --> 01:29:26.761
VERSION DOES NOT INCLUDE THE

01:29:26.828 --> 01:29:31.032
PMI. M. I. A. FUNDS- SO AT SOME

01:29:31.099 --> 01:29:33.067
POINT WE SHOULD CLARIFY THAT

01:29:33.134 --> 01:29:38.606
BUT- IT IS BOTH A AND R. IS

01:29:38.673 --> 01:29:40.575

TO MAKE SURE IT CAN WORK WHAT

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:10.037
SHOULD WE DO TO MAKE IT WORK

01:30:10.104 --> 01:30:12.540
FOR US BECAUSE FRANKLY TO SAY

YEARS AT THIS RATE AT THIS

01:30:29.657 --> 01:30:33.661
PACE- TO GET THE- FINANCIAL

01:30:33.728 --> 01:30:35.196

02:05:54.046 --> 02:05:55.114
TAKING THESE IMPORTANT POSITIVE

02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:56.215
WAY FROM THE SMALL LOCAL

02:05:56.282 --> 02:05:58.017
FINANCIALS ACCUSED WITHIN FIVE

02:05:58.083 --> 02:06:00.419
YEARS. AND THAT'S THE WAY FOR

02:06:00.486 --> 02:06:00.986
SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT

02:06:01.053 --> 02:06:02.187
THEY SERVE. THE GOAL OF PUBLIC

02:06:02.254 --> 02:06:03.422
BANKS TO SERVE THE COMMUNITIES

02:06:03.489 --> 02:06:04.456
WHICH WHAT CREDIT UNIONS AND

02:06:04.523 --> 02:06:06.892
COMMUNITY BANKS AND SEE IF AYE

02:06:06.959 --> 02:06:07.493
AYES ARE CURRENTLY DOING WITH

02:06:07.559 --> 02:06:09.228
THESE DEPOSITS. I WANT TO SHIFT

02:06:09.295 --> 02:06:10.629
GEARS AND BRIEFLY DISCUSS THE

02:06:10.696 --> 02:06:12.364
WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE THUS

02:06:12.431 --> 02:06:14.867
FAR PUBLIC BANKING. AS WE'VE

02:06:14.934 --> 02:06:15.668
TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT

02:06:15.734 --> 02:06:16.669
ALREADY LAST YEAR THE

02:06:16.735 --> 02:06:18.704
LEGISLATURE PASSED EIGHTY EIGHT

02:06:18.771 --> 02:06:19.571
FIFTY SEVEN WHICH ALLOWS CITIES

02:06:19.638 --> 02:06:20.572
AND REGIONS TO CREATE THEIR OWN

02:06:20.639 --> 02:06:22.041
PUBLIC BANKS AFTER SUBMITTING A

02:06:22.107 --> 02:06:24.576
PLAN. DEPARTMENT FINANCIAL

02:06:24.643 --> 02:06:26.111
PROTECTION INNOVATION. THIS IS

02:06:26.178 --> 02:06:27.246
A MONUMENTAL PIECE OF

02:06:27.313 --> 02:06:28.914
LEGISLATION ONE THAT PRETTY

02:06:28.981 --> 02:06:30.449
MUCH EVERYONE IN THIS VIRTUAL

02:06:30.516 --> 02:06:30.916
ROOM BARS WORKED VERY

02:06:30.983 --> 02:06:33.085
DILIGENTLY ON. ALL FOR A GREAT

02:06:33.152 --> 02:06:34.720
LEAGUE WAS NO DIFFERENT WE WERE

02:06:34.787 --> 02:06:35.454
ABLE TO MOVE TO A NEUTRAL

02:06:35.521 --> 02:06:36.822
POSITION AFTER A FEW ROUNDS

02:06:36.889 --> 02:06:38.557

YEAR MY MEMBER CREDIT USE HAVE

02:06:44.363 --> 02:06:45.898
ONE BIG QUESTION WHY NOW. EVEN

02:06:45.965 --> 02:06:47.099
IF WE ARE NOT IN A COVERT

02:06:47.166 --> 02:06:48.367
SHORTENED SESSION MY MEMBER

02:06:48.434 --> 02:06:49.335
PARTIES WERE STILL LEFT

02:06:49.401 --> 02:06:51.036
WONDERING WHY DO WE NOT SEE HOW

02:06:51.103 --> 02:06:53.072
AB FIFTY SEVEN PANS OUT. NOT

02:06:53.138 --> 02:06:55.107
EVEN A YEAR POST ENACTMENT DATE

02:06:55.174 --> 02:06:55.741
WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE WELL IN

02:06:55.808 --> 02:06:57.476
PUBLIC BANKING. ARE WE CLING

02:06:57.543 --> 02:06:59.244
LOCAL PUBLIC BANKS A SUCCESS

02:06:59.311 --> 02:07:00.913
ALREADY. OR WAS IT REALIZED

02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:03.816
WITHOUT THE STATE PUBLIC BANK

02:07:03.882 --> 02:07:04.750
THE LOCAL MODELS NOT POSSIBLE.

02:07:04.817 --> 02:07:06.485
WITH AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN THERE

02:07:06.552 --> 02:07:08.087
IS POTENTIAL FOR A PARTNERSHIP.

02:07:08.153 --> 02:07:09.088
BETWEEN LOCAL FINANCIAL

02:07:09.154 --> 02:07:10.656
INSTITUTIONS. AND THE LOCAL

02:07:10.723 --> 02:07:12.791
BANKS. AND WE STRONGLY BELIEVE

02:07:12.858 --> 02:07:13.692
THAT WE SHOULD WAIT AND SEE HOW

02:07:13.759 --> 02:07:16.128
THAT PLAYS OUT BEFORE EXPAND

02:07:16.195 --> 02:07:17.463

OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ON THIS

02:07:53.432 --> 02:07:55.367
MATTER WE AGREE WITH THE PRIOR

02:07:55.434 --> 02:07:56.735
COMMENTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:07:56.802 --> 02:07:58.270
IS ALREADY ADDRESSED THE ISSUE

02:07:58.337 --> 02:07:59.938
OF PUBLIC BANKING. LOCAL

02:08:00.005 --> 02:08:01.407
MUNICIPALITIES ASKED FOR THE

02:08:01.473 --> 02:08:02.975
ABILITY TO CREATE PUBLIC BANKS

02:08:03.042 --> 02:08:04.543

02:08:04.610 --> 02:08:06.211
THEM THAT AUTHORITY THIS VERY

02:08:06.278 --> 02:08:08.280
LAST LEGISLATIVE SESSION. WELL

02:08:08.347 --> 02:08:09.715
THE PROPONENTS OF PUBLIC BANKS

02:08:09.782 --> 02:08:11.784
OF DISCUSSES VIRTUES WE STILL

02:08:11.850 --> 02:08:12.751
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE

02:08:12.818 --> 02:08:15.554
PERCEIVED- BENEFITS OUTWEIGH

02:08:15.621 --> 02:08:16.922
THE RISKS PARTICULARLY WHEN WE

02:08:16.989 --> 02:08:18.524
CONSIDER THE GENERAL FUND IS

02:08:18.590 --> 02:08:20.659
THE RESCUE. TO HELP ILLUSTRATE

02:08:20.726 --> 02:08:22.027
THIS VIEW I'D LIKE TO TAKE A

02:08:22.094 --> 02:08:23.095
MOMENT TO SPEAK ABOUT THE

02:08:23.162 --> 02:08:24.830
CURRENT ENVIRONMENT THAT BANKS

02:08:24.897 --> 02:08:26.131
FIND THEMSELVES IN RIGHT NOW

02:08:26.198 --> 02:08:29.701
AND- I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE FOR

02:08:29.768 --> 02:08:31.003
USING BANK TERMINOLOGY. WELL

02:08:31.070 --> 02:08:32.271
THERE ARE PLENTY OF BANKS

02:08:32.337 --> 02:08:34.740
OFFERING SERVICES TO CALIFORNIA

02:08:34.807 --> 02:08:35.808
COMMUNITIES THERE'S A GREAT

02:08:35.874 --> 02:08:37.709
DEAL OF CONSOLIDATION WITHIN

02:08:37.776 --> 02:08:39.545
THE INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW.

02:08:39.611 --> 02:08:41.513
INTEREST RATES ARE AT HISTORIC

02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:43.248
LOWS AND THEY LIKELY WILL BE

02:08:43.315 --> 02:08:44.616
FOR QUITE SOME TIME THIS IS

02:08:44.683 --> 02:08:46.452
RESULTED IN AN INDUSTRY WIDE

02:08:46.518 --> 02:08:48.754
DECREASE IN NET INTEREST INCOME

02:08:48.821 --> 02:08:50.589
WHICH IS AN INDICATOR OF THE

02:08:50.656 --> 02:08:52.491
BANKS PROFITABILITY. ONE OF

02:08:52.558 --> 02:08:53.892
BANKS NET INTEREST INCOME

02:08:53.959 --> 02:08:55.594
DECREASES WHILE THE BANK IS

02:08:55.661 --> 02:08:57.496
TRYING TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE

02:08:57.563 --> 02:08:59.298
CAPITAL RATIOS ONE OF THE ONLY

02:08:59.364 --> 02:09:00.866
LOVERS OF BANK AND PULL AN

02:09:00.933 --> 02:09:02.835
EFFORT NOT TO LOSE MONEY IS AN

02:09:02.901 --> 02:09:05.204
EXPENSE REDUCTION. SO BANKS

02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:06.905
EFFICIENCY RATIO BECOMES VERY

02:09:06.972 --> 02:09:09.108
IMPORTANT. THIS RATIO IS A

02:09:09.174 --> 02:09:10.676
MEASURE OF A BANK'S OPERATING

02:09:10.742 --> 02:09:12.177
EXPENSE SO IT'S A VERY

02:09:12.244 --> 02:09:13.979
CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT FOR THE

02:09:14.046 --> 02:09:15.447
INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW AND THE

02:09:15.514 --> 02:09:17.483
STATE BANK IS GOING TO HAVE ALL

02:09:17.549 --> 02:09:19.585
THE SAME CHALLENGES. ONE OF THE

02:09:19.651 --> 02:09:20.919
QUESTIONS BEFORE THE

02:09:20.986 --> 02:09:23.255
LEGISLATURE IS CAN A STATE BANK

02:09:23.322 --> 02:09:25.357
BE EFFICIENT ENOUGH TO NOT LOSE

02:09:25.424 --> 02:09:27.059
MONEY IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WHICH

02:09:27.126 --> 02:09:29.328
CAN ABSOLUTELY HAPPEN. A PUBLIC

02:09:29.394 --> 02:09:31.597
BANKS OVERHEAD IN COST OF FUNDS

02:09:31.663 --> 02:09:32.898
OR GOING TO BE THE SAME AS A

02:09:32.965 --> 02:09:34.199
PRIVATE ENTITY AND IF THAT

02:09:34.266 --> 02:09:36.034
PUBLIC BANK IS. NOW GOING TO

02:09:36.101 --> 02:09:37.903
MAKE LOW INTEREST LOANS AS IT

02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:39.638
IS PROPOSED TO DO THAT IS GOING

02:09:39.705 --> 02:09:40.973
TO HAVE EVEN MORE OF A

02:09:41.039 --> 02:09:43.008
COMPRESSED NET INTEREST MARGIN

02:09:43.075 --> 02:09:43.709
AND HAVE TO BE EVEN MORE

02:09:43.775 --> 02:09:46.245
EFFICIENT. LAYER ON TOP OF THAT

02:09:46.311 --> 02:09:47.813
THE FACT THAT THE PROPONENTS

02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:49.548
ARE ADVOCATING FOR THIS PUBLIC

02:09:49.615 --> 02:09:51.550
BANK TO ENGAGE IN SOME FAIRLY

02:09:51.617 --> 02:09:53.719
RISKY LENDING ACTIVITY. SO NOW

02:09:53.785 --> 02:09:54.887
THE BANK IS GOING TO HAVE TO

02:09:54.953 --> 02:09:56.555
SET ASIDE EVEN MORE MONEY FOR

02:09:56.622 --> 02:09:58.824
LOSS RESERVES. AND PROVISION

02:09:58.891 --> 02:10:00.926
FOR IT ACCORDING TO REGULATION

02:10:00.993 --> 02:10:01.527
AND THAT'S GOING TO EAT INTO

02:10:01.593 --> 02:10:03.962
ITS CAPITAL. WE DON'T SEE HOW A

02:10:04.029 --> 02:10:06.098
PUBLIC BANK OPERATING IN THIS

02:10:06.165 --> 02:10:07.900
MANNER OUT LIKE BRED BY THE

02:10:07.966 --> 02:10:09.067
PROPONENTS AND CERTAINLY AS

02:10:09.134 --> 02:10:11.570
DESCRIBED. IN AB THREE TEN CAN

02:10:11.637 --> 02:10:13.238
SURVIVE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT

02:10:13.305 --> 02:10:14.406
CERTAINLY A PRIVATE ENTITY

02:10:14.473 --> 02:10:16.708
COULD NOT. AND THAT'S EXACTLY

02:10:16.775 --> 02:10:17.943
WHY YOU'RE SEEING SO MUCH

02:10:18.010 --> 02:10:19.311
CONSOLIDATION IN THE INDUSTRY

02:10:19.378 --> 02:10:20.546
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT'S A VERY

02:10:20.612 --> 02:10:22.080
CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT YOU

02:10:22.147 --> 02:10:26.185
DON'T SEE A LOT OF NEW BANKS.

02:10:26.251 --> 02:10:26.818
STARTING UP FOR THIS PARTICULAR

02:10:26.885 --> 02:10:27.352
REASON. NO WE ARE CERTAIN

02:10:27.419 --> 02:10:28.554
ENCOURAGE TO HEAR THAT PUBLIC

02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:30.722
BANK PROPONENTS ACCEPT THE IDEA

02:10:30.789 --> 02:10:31.823
THAT A PUBLIC BANK NEEDS TO BE

02:10:31.890 --> 02:10:33.458
REGULATED THOUGH THERE SEEMS TO

02:10:33.525 --> 02:10:35.460
BE SOME DISPUTE. AS TO WHETHER

02:10:35.527 --> 02:10:36.662
OR NOT DEPOSITS WOULD BE

02:10:36.728 --> 02:10:39.031
INSURED AS EIGHTY THREE TEN DID

02:10:39.097 --> 02:10:41.033
NOT REQUIRE THAT. WE BELIEVE

02:10:41.099 --> 02:10:43.101
THAT THAT REGULATION IS VITAL.

02:10:43.168 --> 02:10:44.403
VITALLY IMPORTANT TO THE SAFETY

02:10:44.469 --> 02:10:45.737
AND SOUNDNESS OF THE BANKING

02:10:45.804 --> 02:10:47.506
SYSTEM BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT

02:10:47.573 --> 02:10:48.774
A PUBLIC BANK. MUST BE

02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:50.542
REGULATED IN THE SAME MANNER AS

02:10:50.609 --> 02:10:52.878
A PRIVATE INSTITUTION. S. TO

02:10:52.945 --> 02:10:55.047
DEPOSIT INSURANCE SINCE THESE

02:10:55.113 --> 02:10:56.915
ARE IN ESSENCE TAXPAYER DOLLARS

02:10:56.982 --> 02:10:58.750
REALLY GENERAL FUND REVENUE

02:10:58.817 --> 02:11:00.219
THEN THEY SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE

02:11:00.285 --> 02:11:02.487
INSURED. BUT WHAT YOU'RE BEING

02:11:02.554 --> 02:11:04.156
ASKED TO DO AS A LEGISLATURE IS

02:11:04.223 --> 02:11:06.225
NOT JUST CONSIDER THE FORMATION

02:11:06.291 --> 02:11:07.292
OF AN INJURY THAT TAKES

02:11:07.359 --> 02:11:09.194
DEPOSITS AND MAKES LOANS. WHICH

02:11:09.261 --> 02:11:10.262
ARE ALSO BEING ASKED TO

02:11:10.329 --> 02:11:11.230
CONSIDER THE ENTIRE

02:11:11.296 --> 02:11:12.798
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THAT

02:11:12.864 --> 02:11:15.334
ENTITY. FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE

02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:17.736
AREAS THAT THE BANKING INDUSTRY

02:11:17.803 --> 02:11:18.170
HAS EXCELLED IN HIS

02:11:18.237 --> 02:11:20.172
CYBERSECURITY. BANKS OFTEN KNOW

02:11:20.239 --> 02:11:21.573
WHEN FRAUD HAS OCCURRED ON AN

02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:22.808
ACCOUNT BEFORE THE CUSTOMER

02:11:22.874 --> 02:11:24.610
DOES. THE IS VERY COMPLEX

02:11:24.676 --> 02:11:26.612
ALGORITHMS AND FRAUD FILTERS TO

02:11:26.678 --> 02:11:28.513
DETECT FRAUD. YOU JUST DON'T

02:11:28.580 --> 02:11:30.015
SEE A LOT OF DATA BREACHES

02:11:30.082 --> 02:11:31.383
OCCURRING IN THE BANKING

02:11:31.450 --> 02:11:33.552
INDUSTRY. BUT THERE'S A COST TO

02:11:33.619 --> 02:11:35.087
PROTECTING CUSTOMERS. THE

02:11:35.153 --> 02:11:36.421
LARGEST BANKS ARE SPENDING

02:11:36.488 --> 02:11:37.789
NORTH OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION

02:11:37.856 --> 02:11:39.391
DOLLARS A YEAR AND IT

02:11:39.458 --> 02:11:40.158
INFRASTRUCTURE AND

02:11:40.225 --> 02:11:42.427
CYBERSECURITY. SO LEGITIMATE

02:11:42.494 --> 02:11:43.629
QUESTION BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE

02:11:43.695 --> 02:11:45.364
NOW IS DOES THE STATE OF

02:11:45.430 --> 02:11:47.599
CALIFORNIA HAVE THE IT SYSTEMS

02:11:47.666 --> 02:11:49.401
TO SUPPORT A BANKING NETWORK.

02:11:49.468 --> 02:11:51.136
AGAIN THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE

02:11:51.203 --> 02:11:54.539
OF THE NUMEROUS. CHALLENGES OF

02:11:54.606 --> 02:11:55.340
PUBLIC BANK WILL HAVE. THEN THE

02:11:55.407 --> 02:11:56.875
NOTION THAT A PUBLIC BANK CAN

02:11:56.942 --> 02:11:58.410
BETTER SERVE ITS COMMUNITIES

02:11:58.477 --> 02:12:00.045
THAN PRIVATE ENTITIES. BUT

02:12:00.112 --> 02:12:01.613
STATE BANK WOULD HAVE NO BRICK

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:02.981
AND MORTAR PRESENCE IN THEIR

02:12:03.048 --> 02:12:04.983
COMMUNITIES. WE UNDERSTAND THAT

02:12:05.050 --> 02:12:06.151
THE PROPONENTS FOR PUBLIC

02:12:06.218 --> 02:12:07.286
BANKING CONTEND THAT THEY WILL

02:12:07.352 --> 02:12:08.720
PARTNER WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY

02:12:08.787 --> 02:12:10.522
BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS. BUT IN

02:12:10.589 --> 02:12:11.690
ORDER FOR A PUBLIC BANK TO

02:12:11.757 --> 02:12:13.058
EXIST IT WOULD NEED TO TAKE

02:12:13.125 --> 02:12:14.393
DEPOSITS FROM STATE AND LOCAL

02:12:14.459 --> 02:12:16.161
GOVERNMENTS. AND THESE DEPOSITS

02:12:16.228 --> 02:12:17.996
ARE CURRENTLY USED BY COMMUNITY

02:12:18.063 --> 02:12:19.731
BANKS PRIMARILY AS A SOURCE OF

02:12:19.798 --> 02:12:21.066
LIQUIDITY WHICH IS THEN GOING

02:12:21.133 --> 02:12:22.801
BACK INTO THE COMMUNITIES.

02:12:22.868 --> 02:12:24.269
THROUGH LENDING PRODUCTS AND

02:12:24.336 --> 02:12:26.405
SERVICES. THAT WOULD NOT BE A

02:12:26.471 --> 02:12:27.806
PARTNERSHIP IN THAT SENSE AND

02:12:27.873 --> 02:12:29.574
IN FACT IT WOULD BE DEVASTATING

02:12:29.641 --> 02:12:31.510
TO SOME COMMUNITY BANKS. THEY

02:12:31.576 --> 02:12:32.778
WON'T BE AROUND FOR THAT

02:12:32.844 --> 02:12:33.712
PARTNERSHIP TO COME TO

02:12:33.779 --> 02:12:35.447
FRUITION. AND THIS IS A POINT

02:12:35.514 --> 02:12:36.948
THAT I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH

02:12:37.015 --> 02:12:38.450
WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED IT'S

02:12:38.517 --> 02:12:40.919
JUST TAKE AWAY. VITAL LIQUIDITY

02:12:40.986 --> 02:12:41.953
FROM COMMUNITY BANKS THAT

02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:43.889
CURRENTLY HAVE A BRICK AND

02:12:43.955 --> 02:12:44.823
MORTAR PRESENCE IN THEIR

02:12:44.890 --> 02:12:46.658
COMMUNITIES. AND TRANSFERRING

02:12:46.725 --> 02:12:48.593
IT TO A STATE ENTITY THAT HAS

02:12:48.660 --> 02:12:50.095
NO BRICK AND MORTAR PRESENCE IN

02:12:50.162 --> 02:12:52.631
THE COMMUNITY. THAT WE LOST TO

02:12:52.698 --> 02:12:53.165
THE STATE BANKING CHARTER

02:12:53.231 --> 02:12:55.167

FUNDING. OUR FIRST I WANT TO BE

02:13:57.396 --> 02:13:58.563
CLEAR TO THE GROUP THAT THE

CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF

02:13:59.965 --> 02:14:01.133
COUNTY TREASURERS AND TAX

02:14:01.199 --> 02:14:02.868
COLLECTORS IS NOT AGAINST THE

02:14:02.934 --> 02:14:05.036
IDEA OF A PUBLIC BANK. AND WE

02:14:05.103 --> 02:14:06.204
DIDN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND

02:14:06.271 --> 02:14:07.372
MOTIVATION OF THE PUBLIC

02:14:07.439 --> 02:14:09.408
BANKING ADVOCATES. OF THEIR

02:14:09.474 --> 02:14:10.609

02:14:10.675 --> 02:14:12.077
WITH PUBLIC BANK ADVOCATES TO

02:14:12.144 --> 02:14:13.211
COMPLETE THE STUDY IS NEEDED TO

02:14:13.278 --> 02:14:16.415
SEE IF A PUBLIC HEARING THANK

02:14:16.481 --> 02:14:16.848
IS A VIABLE IN THEIR

02:14:16.915 --> 02:14:18.350
COMMUNITIES. WE ALL SERVE THE

02:14:18.417 --> 02:14:19.718
COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE LIVE

02:14:19.785 --> 02:14:21.153
AND WE CAN'T ENVISION THE

02:14:21.219 --> 02:14:22.487
POTENTIAL BENEFITS THAT A WELL

02:14:22.554 --> 02:14:23.889
ESTABLISHED PUBLIC BANK CAN

02:14:23.955 --> 02:14:25.524
PROVIDE TO OUR COMMUNITIES.

02:14:25.590 --> 02:14:26.992
WHERE WE DO DIFFER THOSE STEMS

02:14:27.058 --> 02:14:29.227
FROM HOW PUBLIC BANK IS FUNDED

02:14:29.294 --> 02:14:31.396
AND THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

02:14:31.463 --> 02:14:33.031
THE BIRTH OF A PUBLIC BANK. WE

02:14:33.098 --> 02:14:35.834
HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOPING THAT-WORKS WE ALL HEARD ABOUT THE

02:14:35.901 --> 02:14:38.036
BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA. AND THE

02:14:38.103 --> 02:14:39.504
SUCCESSFUL BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA

02:14:39.571 --> 02:14:41.473
WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN

02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:42.607
NINETEEN AND TOOK OVER THIRTY

02:14:42.674 --> 02:14:44.576
YEARS TO BECOME SUSTAINABLE.

02:14:44.643 --> 02:14:45.944
AND IT DOES NOT SERVE THE SAME

02:14:46.011 --> 02:14:47.579
POPULATION OF CUSTOMERS OF THE

02:14:47.646 --> 02:14:48.980
PROPONENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE

02:14:49.047 --> 02:14:51.283
SEEKING TO SERVE. AND LOCAL

02:14:51.349 --> 02:14:54.186
AGENCIES CAN VOLUNTARILY

02:14:54.252 --> 02:14:55.854
DEPOSIT FUNDS INTO THE BANK.

02:14:55.921 --> 02:14:57.155
CURRENT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT A

02:14:57.222 --> 02:14:58.824
PUBLIC BANKING CALIFORNIA ONCE

02:14:58.890 --> 02:15:01.026
FORMED COULD TAKE ABOUT TEN

02:15:01.092 --> 02:15:01.993
YEARS OR MORE TO BECOME

02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:03.962
SUFFICIENTLY SOLVENT ENOUGH FOR

02:15:04.029 --> 02:15:06.364
LOCAL AGENCY DEPOSIT. AND THIS

02:15:06.431 --> 02:15:07.699
PROCESS OF BECOMING FULLY

02:15:07.766 --> 02:15:10.202
REGULATED COULD TAKE YEARS AND

02:15:10.268 --> 02:15:12.204
BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. THIS

02:15:12.270 --> 02:15:13.905
LONG AND EXPENSIVE PROCESS IS

02:15:13.972 --> 02:15:14.873
WHAT OTHER PUBLIC BASE THE

02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:16.174
FAILED AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE

02:15:16.241 --> 02:15:19.244
HESITANT TO COMMIT LOCAL AGENCY

02:15:19.311 --> 02:15:20.879
TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THROUGHOUT

02:15:20.946 --> 02:15:23.281
THE DISCUSSIONS ON EIGHTY EIGHT

02:15:23.348 --> 02:15:24.850
FIFTY SEVEN AND THEN AGAIN WITH

02:15:24.916 --> 02:15:25.417
EIGHTY THREE TEN WE'VE HEARD

02:15:25.484 --> 02:15:27.219
PUBLIC BEING PROPONENTS PROPOSE

02:15:27.285 --> 02:15:28.653
THE USE OF COUNTY DEPOSITS TO

02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:30.622
FUND THESE BANKS. AND TIME AND

02:15:30.689 --> 02:15:32.924
TIME AGAIN AND TOLD THEM THAT

02:15:32.991 --> 02:15:34.292
WE JUST COULD NOT SUPPORT THIS.

02:15:34.359 --> 02:15:35.427
EACH OF US TAKES AN OATH OF

02:15:35.494 --> 02:15:37.062
OFFICE TO SERVE AND PROTECT.

02:15:37.128 --> 02:15:38.864
TREASURES FROM AROUND THE STATE

02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:40.732
ALSO TAKE AN OATH TO UPHOLD THE

02:15:40.799 --> 02:15:42.334
PRUDENT INVESTOR STANDARD.

02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:43.335
WHICH STATES THAT WE MUST

02:15:43.401 --> 02:15:45.136
INVEST FUNDS OF THAT FIRST AND

02:15:45.203 --> 02:15:47.339
FOREMOST. THE SAFETY OF

02:15:47.405 --> 02:15:49.441
PRINCIPLES OF HEALTH. SECONDLY

02:15:49.508 --> 02:15:50.842
THAT WE NEED A LIQUIDITY NEEDS

02:15:50.909 --> 02:15:52.410
OF OUR COMMUNITIES SPECIFICALLY

02:15:52.477 --> 02:15:54.246
OUR LOCAL SCHOOLS ARE FIRE

NECESSARY FUNDING AT THEIR

02:16:03.188 --> 02:16:04.589
A FINER POINT TO IT THINK ABOUT

02:16:04.656 --> 02:16:06.658
THE COST COUNTIES IN SCHOOL THE

02:16:06.725 --> 02:16:08.460
PER DURING THIS PANDEMIC ALONE.

02:16:08.527 --> 02:16:10.428

THIS REQUIRED MONEY AND WHILE

02:16:19.804 --> 02:16:21.273
WE BELIEVE THERE'S GOING TO BE

02:16:21.339 --> 02:16:22.107
REIMBURSEMENT AT THE FEDERAL

02:16:22.173 --> 02:16:24.576

02:16:37.355 --> 02:16:37.856
PRUDENT WAY TO MANAGE THOSE

HOW MUCH MONEY AND- OVER HOW

02:33:33.571 --> 02:33:34.672
MANY YEARS IT WOULD TAKE TO

02:33:34.738 --> 02:33:38.075
BREAK EVEN- I WANT TO LOOK INTO

02:33:38.142 --> 02:33:39.643
THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT- I

02:33:39.710 --> 02:33:41.612
WAS. HOPING THERE'D BE MORE OF

02:33:41.679 --> 02:33:44.248
THAT KIND O A BREAKDOWN OF

02:33:44.315 --> 02:33:46.717

02:33:48.252 --> 02:33:51.288
OF COMMENTS ABOUT THE RISK-

02:33:51.355 --> 02:33:53.724
THAT THE STATE WOULD BE TAKING

AND OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO LOOK

02:33:56.260 --> 02:33:58.862
AT THAT. BUT THAT WOULD SEEM

02:33:58.929 --> 02:34:00.598
SOMETHING MUCH MORE THAT WE

02:34:00.664 --> 02:34:03.100

OF A RISK BUT IT SEEMS TO ME

02:34:16.313 --> 02:34:18.616
THERE'S NOT MUCH OF A- F A

02:34:18.682 --> 02:34:20.985
COMPETITION HERE WITH- WITH THE

02:34:30.361 --> 02:34:33.497
EXTRAORDINARY CRISIS.

02:34:35.165 --> 02:34:38.335
CRISIS AND YET WE CAN'T USE.

02:34:38.402 --> 02:34:43.007
SOMEHOW USE OUR FUNDS TO ASSIST

02:34:43.073 --> 02:34:44.975
IN SOLVING THAT CRISIS AT LEAST

02:34:45.042 --> 02:34:46.777
NOT ON THE LEVEL I SHOULD SAY

02:34:46.844 --> 02:34:48.779
NOT USING AT ALL AT LEAST NOT

02:34:48.846 --> 02:34:51.015
ON THE LEVEL THAT WE COULD BE

02:34:51.081 --> 02:34:52.683

02:37:40.684 --> 02:37:42.119
THIS IS JUST A SUMMARY IS THAT

02:37:42.186 --> 02:37:44.154
WE'VE WE'VE SET UP SOME. SOME

02:37:44.221 --> 02:37:45.923
OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOME

02:37:45.989 --> 02:37:50.727
MUNICIPAL BANKS. AND IT IT'S AN

02:37:50.794 --> 02:37:52.262
EXPERIMENT REALLY TO SEE

02:37:52.329 --> 02:37:55.599
WHETHER ANY ANY OF THESE-

02:37:55.666 --> 02:37:57.935
ENTITIES ACTUALLY. BECOME

02:37:58.001 --> 02:38:00.137
REALITY WHETHER THERE'S AN

02:38:00.204 --> 02:38:03.574
INTEREST IN INVESTING IN- THE

02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:05.542
INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO BE

02:38:05.609 --> 02:38:06.410
ABLE TO PUT ONE OF THESE

02:38:06.476 --> 02:38:09.446
TOGETHER AND- AND LET'S BE VERY

02:38:09.513 --> 02:38:11.582
CLEAR ABOUT IT IT'S CITY

02:38:11.648 --> 02:38:13.750
INTENDING INCREDIBLY HUGE

02:38:13.817 --> 02:38:15.552
INVESTMENT. OF TIME AND

02:38:15.619 --> 02:38:17.120
RESOURCES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE

02:38:17.187 --> 02:38:19.823
TO. CREATE AN ENTITY THAT HAS

02:38:19.890 --> 02:38:22.860
THE OP THAT THAT HAS THAT THAT

02:38:22.926 --> 02:38:24.361
THE WHERE WITH ALL TO BE ABLE

02:38:24.428 --> 02:38:25.529
TO DO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

02:38:25.596 --> 02:38:28.432
WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT FOR OUR

02:38:28.498 --> 02:38:30.033
COMMUNITY WHETHER IT'S-

02:38:30.100 --> 02:38:31.835
FINANCIAL LITERACY WHETHER IT'S

02:38:31.902 --> 02:38:33.303
LOW INTEREST LOANS WHETHER IT'S

02:38:33.370 --> 02:38:37.007
SMALL BUSINESS LOANS- IT. IT'S

02:38:37.074 --> 02:38:38.876
AN INVESTMENT AND IT'S GOING TO

02:38:38.942 --> 02:38:40.944
COST AND- WHAT I THINK I HEARD

02:38:41.011 --> 02:38:43.380
TODAY IT LEAST FROM FROM THE

02:38:43.447 --> 02:38:45.716
PARTNER WELL AND THEN IF WE DO

02:38:45.782 --> 02:38:46.917
THIS IT'S GONNA BE A

02:38:46.984 --> 02:38:47.918
PARTNERSHIP WITH A NUMBER OF

02:38:47.985 --> 02:38:50.420
DIFFERENT- ENTITIES WHETHER

02:38:50.487 --> 02:38:52.556
THEY BE BANKS OR CREDIT UNIONS

02:38:52.623 --> 02:38:55.158
AND THEN CITIES AND COUNTIES.

02:38:55.225 --> 02:38:57.094
AND- AND SO THAT'S THE

02:38:57.160 --> 02:38:58.362
FRAMEWORK THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:38:58.428 --> 02:39:00.230
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS WORK

02:39:00.297 --> 02:39:02.833
IN AND THEN- AND THEN THE

02:39:02.900 --> 02:39:05.335
FINANCIAL PART OF BEING A CITY

02:39:05.402 --> 02:39:06.670

02:39:06.737 --> 02:39:08.105

LIQUIDITY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE

02:39:15.746 --> 02:39:16.880
THAT THE RESOURCES AT YOUR

FINGERTIPS WHEN IT COMES TIME

02:39:18.849 --> 02:39:20.717

THAT RESPONSIBILITY. AND YOU

02:39:30.861 --> 02:39:32.996
HAVE TO ASCERTAIN THAT IN SO

02:39:33.063 --> 02:39:34.364
WHEN I HEARD IN TERMS OF THE

02:39:34.431 --> 02:39:35.832
STAKEHOLDERS IS THAT THERE ARE

02:39:35.899 --> 02:39:38.035
SOME REAL CONCERNS WITH THAT

A VERY SERIOUS CLLS PROPOSAL

NOTHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT

WE'RE PROPOSING FOR STATE

03:44:33.326 --> 03:44:35.862
PUBLIC BANK THIS ISN'T. AN IDEA

03:44:37.730 --> 03:44:39.666
SERIOUS POLICY PROPOSAL- THAT

OTHER. BANKING ENTITY ARE

03:44:50.009 --> 03:44:51.811
AVAILABLE AND LET'S JUST FACE

03:44:51.878 --> 03:44:52.745
IT NEEDED THE D. CURRENT

03:44:52.812 --> 03:44:57.517
BANKING SYSTEM IS BROKEN. WE

03:44:57.584 --> 03:44:58.585
SEEN GREAT WORK FROM. CREDIT

UNIONS WE SEEM WORKS- TO ME

03:45:00.186 --> 03:45:01.721
BANK- BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT

03:45:01.788 --> 03:45:04.190
IN A GREATER SCALE ALSO WE SEE.

03:45:04.257 --> 03:45:06.793
WE SEE THE ABILITY OF THE STATE

03:45:06.860 --> 03:45:08.862
PUBLIC BANK. DURING UP WITH

03:45:08.928 --> 03:45:12.532
YOUR WITH A CD- ADVISE AT A

03:45:12.599 --> 03:45:14.434
LOCAL LEVEL ARE WE SEEING. THE

03:45:14.500 --> 03:45:16.836
POSSIBILITY ARE YOU CAN EVEN

03:45:16.903 --> 03:45:19.038
ENVISION A SCENARIO WHERE.

03:45:19.105 --> 03:45:20.406
AIRBAGS ALWAYS IN THE FUTURE

03:45:20.473 --> 03:45:22.542
HOUSE- AND LEVERAGE WITH

03:45:22.609 --> 03:45:23.576
COMMUNITY BANKS AND CREDIT

03:45:23.643 --> 03:45:26.212
UNIONS TO DO MORE LOCAL LENDING

03:45:26.279 --> 03:45:27.380
TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND I THINK

03:45:27.447 --> 03:45:29.849
IT'S YOUR IT IF WE WERE TO TALK

03:45:29.916 --> 03:45:31.384
TO SMALL BUSINESS. THERE'S A

03:45:31.451 --> 03:45:34.354
LOT OF LACK AND A LOT OF WANT

03:45:34.420 --> 03:45:36.456
IN TERMS OF NEEDS- THAT WEREN'T

03:45:36.522 --> 03:45:38.625
AVAILABLE TO HIM TO BIG BANKS.

03:45:38.691 --> 03:45:40.526
I MEAN THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE-

03:45:40.593 --> 03:45:41.961
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY I

03:45:42.028 --> 03:45:44.430
THINK THERE ARE BETTER USES. OF

03:45:44.497 --> 03:45:44.998
TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE BETTER

03:45:45.064 --> 03:45:48.334
USES OF OUR STATE- DOLLARS.

03:45:48.401 --> 03:45:50.303
WHEN IT COMES TO HELPING SMALL

03:45:50.370 --> 03:45:51.004
BUSINESSES WHEN IT COMES TO

03:45:51.070 --> 03:45:54.641
HELPING- SMALL FARMERS WHEN IT

03:45:54.707 --> 03:45:56.276
COMES TO HELPING TO BUILD

03:45:56.342 --> 03:45:58.111
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OR JUST

03:45:58.177 --> 03:45:59.445
HELPING US OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC

03:45:59.512 --> 03:46:01.414
OR OR EVEN DURING A NON

03:46:01.481 --> 03:46:02.682
PANDEMIC TONS I THINK THERE'S

03:46:02.749 --> 03:46:04.350
NEEDS TO BE A REIMAGINING. OF

03:46:04.417 --> 03:46:06.786
HOW WE DOING ANY BANKING SYSTEM

03:46:06.853 --> 03:46:08.054
SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING

03:46:08.121 --> 03:46:09.555
THAT CONVERSATION. AS WE

03:46:09.622 --> 03:46:11.257
CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD I KNOW

03:46:11.324 --> 03:46:12.392
THAT WAS A COUPLE OF THE

03:46:12.458 --> 03:46:13.559
TREASURES WERE CLOSE BUT BUT

03:46:13.626 --> 03:46:14.761
CERTAINLY THERE WAS TREASURES

03:46:14.827 --> 03:46:15.895
LIKE THE ONES IN MY OWN

03:46:15.962 --> 03:46:17.630
BACKYARD OTHER AREAS OF

03:46:17.697 --> 03:46:18.164
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE VERY

03:46:18.231 --> 03:46:21.100
SUPPORTIVE. OF A PUBLIC BANKS-

03:46:21.167 --> 03:46:22.769
AND IT MAKES ABSOLUTE SENSE TO

03:46:22.835 --> 03:46:27.006
ANSWER THE QUESTIONS IT. MAKES

03:46:27.073 --> 03:46:28.041
SENSE IT ABSOLUTELY MAKES SENSE.

03:46:28.107 --> 03:46:29.509
EIGHT A BANKING SYSTEM. THAT

03:46:29.575 --> 03:46:30.977
THAT PUTS PEOPLE'S. IN OUR

03:46:31.044 --> 03:46:32.045
COMMUNITY NEEDS ARE SMALL

03:46:32.111 --> 03:46:33.346
BUSINESS NEEDS ARE GOOD

03:46:33.413 --> 03:46:35.014
CULTURAL NEEDS. BEFORE THE

03:46:35.081 --> 03:46:36.316
NEEDS OF PROFITS AND

03:46:36.382 --> 03:46:38.184
STAKEHOLDERS. AND I THINK THAT

03:46:38.251 --> 03:46:39.786
WE HAVE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO

03:46:39.852 --> 03:46:41.554
CREATE THAT HERE. CALIFORNIA

03:46:41.621 --> 03:46:43.189
AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS

03:46:43.256 --> 03:46:44.757
INCREMENTAL CHANGE TO CREATE

03:46:44.824 --> 03:46:46.826
THAT THAT PUBLIC STATE BANK.

03:46:46.893 --> 03:46:48.861
AND WE HAVE A GOOD RAMEWORK

03:46:48.928 --> 03:46:50.997

THE REASONS WHY WE CAN'T DO IT

03:47:07.914 --> 03:47:09.315

03:47:15.588 --> 03:47:17.390
GREAT POTENTIAL AND HAVING. A

LISTENING TO THE PUBLIC.

03:50:32.685 --> 03:50:33.419
PROPERTY SHOULD NOT BE THE MAIN.

03:50:33.486 --> 03:50:34.287
YET THAT'S THEM THE FREEMEN

03:50:34.353 --> 03:50:35.288
UNDERPINNING. A RISK TAKER DO

03:50:35.354 --> 03:50:36.522
SO FOR PROP. AND PAY AND TAX

03:50:36.589 --> 03:50:38.024
ACCORDINGLY. AND I'M CONCERNED-

03:50:38.090 --> 03:50:39.825
AS A LEAD. THAT THE STATE HAS A

03:50:39.892 --> 03:50:41.427
STYLE DRAFT THAT THE GOVERNMENT

03:50:41.494 --> 03:50:43.629
DOES NOT HAVE TO. TO DO

03:50:43.696 --> 03:50:45.598
EVERYTHING THAT WOULD ADDRESS A

03:50:45.665 --> 03:50:47.600
PERCEIVED NEED AND SO WE SHOULD

03:50:47.667 --> 03:50:49.468
PROCEED WITH CAUTION. IF IT

03:50:49.535 --> 03:50:51.737
BANKS ARE VILLAINS WHICH HAS

03:50:51.804 --> 03:50:52.738

REGULATORS WHICH ARE GOVERNMENT

03:50:54.507 --> 03:50:56.075
ARM. MAY BE A PART OF THE

03:50:56.142 --> 03:50:57.944
PROBLEM MAYBE THAT NEEDS TO BE

03:50:58.010 --> 03:50:59.845
RE EVALUATED. SO MY- FAREWELL

03:50:59.912 --> 03:51:01.847
RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE THAT.

03:51:01.914 --> 03:51:03.716
THE STATE CAPITOL SHOULD STICK

03:51:03.783 --> 03:51:04.784
