TO START BY TAKING SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS THAT ARE IN THE ANALYSIS THANK YOU -- IN THE WAR AND WE TAKE THEM IN GEO BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TIME TODAY BUT I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING SO HARD ON THIS ISSUE BOTH. LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR. SO MEMBERS -- THIS BILL. IS IS IS SORT OF A FOLLOW ON TO SEE PACK WHICH IS AN INSTITUTION THAT WE HAD. THE CALIFORNIA POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION COMMISSION. BOB THIS BILL ESTABLISHES THE OFFICE OF HIGHER EDUCATION. COORDINATION ACCOUNTABILITY PERFORMANCE. WHICH WILL ARTICULATE STATE GOALS COORDINATE BETWEEN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND ASSIST THE STATE ESTABLISHING CLEAR HIGHER EDUCATION GENDER SERVE STUDENTS AND MEETS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WORKFORCE DEMANDS. PEPSI BACK WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND CUT COMES OUT OF THE MASTER PLAN. AND IT WAS TO SET OUT TO BE THE STATE'S COORDINATION AND PLANNING BY FOR HIGHER ED. AND YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY THINK IT WORKED DECENTLY OVER THIRTY YEARS AND PROVIDE A FISCAL POLICY VICE THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE. ON POST SECONDARY ISSUES A MONTOR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE STATEWIDE PLANNING. BUT THERE IS A MEMBER OF YOUR ISSUES BEGIN TO EMERGE IN THE EARLY. TWO THOUSANDS ABOT -- THE FUNCTIONING OF C. PACK. AND AS FOLKS REMEMBER. IN TWENTY TEN ALEJO ISSUED A REPORT CALLING FOR ITS REFORM OR REPLACEMENT. THE GOVERNOR BROWN HOUSE. AND IN -- TWENTY ELEVEN TO TWENTY TWELVE HE VETOED FUNDING FOR A FOR C. PACK. ANY CITED THE AGENCY'S INEFFECTIVENESS IN HIGHER EDUCATION OVERSIGHT SO THE ONLY -- CAME BACK RE IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS AND SAID OKAY GREAT. WE GOT TO SEE TECH HAD PROBLEMS WE NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING IN THERE TO REPLACE IT. AND THEY TALK ABOUT REESTABLISHING INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT BODY. AND THEY ALSO SAID THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF OF ANYBODY LEXI PACK THERE'S NO CLEAR ARTICULATION AROUND SPECIFIC STATE GOALS IN A SPECIFIC ENTITY. CHARGED WITH LEADING THE CONVERSATION AND DURING A PUBLIC AGENDA. AND SO BUT THERE WERE SEVERAL TIMES TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE GOVERNOR'S CONCERNS NONE OF THEM. PER SUCCESSFUL ARE WE'RE REALLY HOPING THAT THIS IS THE THIS IS THE MAGIC BULLET THAT WILL SOLVE. THE PROBLEM THIS BILL ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT OFFICE WILL FOCUS ON QUALITY PROGRAM OVERSIGHT REVIEW AND ANALYZE. A VARIETY VARIETY DID INCLUDE GRADUATION RATES AFFORDABILITY FINANCIAL AID O GREEN CERTIFICATION COMPLETION TRANSFER. AND WORK FORCE COORDINATION. IN CONTRAST TO SEE PACK. THE BOARD WILL MAINTAIN INDEPENDENCE FROM THE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE I THINK OF THE GOVERNOR HAD. HAS COMMITTEE COMPOSED OF FIVE MEMBERS THE PUBLIC APPOINTED BY. THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE AND THEN WE'LL HAVE AN ADVISORY BOARD IT'S MADE UP OF OF OF YOU SEE CSU CC PRIVATE NONPROFIT PUBLIC POST. INSTITUTION STUDENTS AND FACULTY AS WELL. AND THEY WILL GIVE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD. SO I THINK THESE CHANGES WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THE WEAKNESSES THAT EXISTED C. PACK. OUR WALL ALSO CARRYING ON WITH THE IMPORTANT CORDONING WORKED AT C. PACK USED. TO I USED TO ENGAGE IN THAT WE REALLY DESPERATELY NEED IN THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL REPORTS ARE OUTLINED ANALYSIS.

PACK WHILE THE BUDGET WAS MODEST THAT NOTHING WAS SPARED AT THE EXTENT THAT THAT TWENTY EIGHT BILLION HAD TO BE FOUND -- I WOULD SAY TO THE CREDIT OF THE INSTITUTIONS. THAT THEY HAVE CONTINUED TO MEET ON AN INFORMAL BASIS THEY I THINK THEY GET TOGETHER EVERY MONTH. AT TO THEIR CREDIT THEY KNOW THE VALUE OF OF CONSULTATION AND COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION -- BUT IT'S IT'S ON AN INFORMAL BASIS AND WHAT'S BEFORE YOU IS A MUCH MORE FORMALIZATION OF OF THIS KIND OF COORDINATION WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT AND WITH THAT TO JOINT CENTER ALLEN ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU CENTER CLEAR THE GLAZER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHARLIEBY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TAYLOR MYERS AND THE POLICY AND RESEARCH ANALYST FOR CALIFORNIA COMPETES HIGHER EDUCATION FOR A STRONG ECONOMY. AN INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT PROJECT THAT HAS LONG SUPPORTED GREATER OVERSIGHT AND COORDINATION IN HIGHER DUCATION TO PROMOTE STUDENT SUCCESS. I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL THREE INTRODUCED BY SENATORS ALLEN ENCLOSURE WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH THE OFFICE OF HIGHER EDUCATION COORDINATION ACCOUNTABILITY AND PERFORMANCE. THE STATEFACES CRITICAL POSTSECONDARY. CHALLENGES INCLUDING RISING COSTS CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS AN INEQUITABLE OUTCOMES NO SEGMENT OR GOVERNING BODY IS CHARGED WITH ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES AND WHOLE. NOW MORE THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME SINCE THE MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION WAS CHARTERED IN. NINETEEN SIXTY THE STATE NEEDS EXPERT LEADERSHIP TO SUPPORT EQUITABLE COLLEGE ACCESS AND COMPLETION FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. WELL THE SEGMENTS OF MADE IMPORTANT EFFORTS TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES AND HIGHER EDUCATION SUCH AS AFFORDABILITY ACCESS AND TIME TO DEGREE FUNDAMENTALLY THESE ARE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMSTHAT TRANSCEND ANY ONE INSTITUTION OR SEGMENT. AND THEY REQUIRE SYSTEMIC SOLUTIONS THE OFFICE ESTABLISHED BY SB THREE COULD TAKE A STATE WIDE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING ISSUES SUCH AS INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY AND SUPPORTING CROSS SECTOR INITIATIVES SUCH AS DUAL ENROLLMENT AND TRANSFER PROGRAMS. SPECIFICALLY SB THREE CREATES THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO DEVELOP STATEWIDE HIGHER EDUCATION GOALS OVERSEE INTER AGENCY EFFORTS AND TO PROMOTE EVIDENCE BASED POLICY MAKING BY USING DATA ACROSS EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE SECTORS. FURTHER SB THREE CAREFULLY THINKS THROUGH THE APPROPRIATE ROLES OF KEY STAKEHOLDERS CREATING AN ADVISORY BOARD WITH STUDENT AND SEGMENT REPRESENTATIVES. THESE FUNCTIONS WILL IMPROVE OUTCOMES ACROSS DIVERSE REGIONS AND STUDENT POPULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM REQUIRES COORDINATED LEADERSHIP AND DATA DRIVEN DECISION MAKING THAT CENTERS THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS. FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT SB THREE AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING CHAIR ELEVEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THERE ARE SEE ON BEHALF OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY. WHERE AN ORGANIZATION THAT'S COMMITTED TO INCREASING COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS IN THE STATE FIRST LIKE TO THANK SENATOR ALLEN AND GLAZIER FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND EXPRESSED OUR SUPPORT OF AB ARE I'M SORRY SB? THREE WE KNOW THAT IN THE COMING YEARS THE STATE MONEY TO GROWING SUPPLY OF EDUCATED WORKERS TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THIS DYNAMIC STATE ECONOMY AND THAT KEY TO FILLING THIS NEED. WILL BE ENSURING THE ACCESS AND SUCCESS OF THOSE POPULATIONS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN UNDERREPRESENTED IN HIGHER EDUCATION. YEAH CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY STANDS OUT AS ONE OF ONLY TWO STATES WITHOUT A STATEWIDE COORDINATING BODY FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. MEANING WE LET THE STATE LEVEL LEADERSHIP RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PLANNING OVERSIGHT AND COORDINATION THE POSITION THE STATE TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES. A BODY THAT IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY ONE SECTOR SEGMENT BUT RATHER UNDERSTANDS THE BROADER NEEDS O THE STATE. I CAN FACILITATE THE NECESSARY. HE'S ME CONVERSATIONS AND ALICE'S AN EXPERTISE TOWARDS THOSE GOALS. WELL IN PERFECT THE CALIFORNIA POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION COMMISSION WAS ABLE TO OFFER ENROLLMENT PROJECTIONS AND ASSESS REGIONAL DEMANDS CRITICAL INFORMATION NECESSARY TO INFORMING POLICY IN BUDGETARY DECISIONS. IN ITS ABSENCE THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AS HAVE OTHERS ARE OFTEN ASKED TO HELP FILL THE VOID IN VARIOUS WAYS THAT IS NEITHER SUSTAINABLE MORE IDEAL IN A STATE WAS SYSTEMS. AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS CALIFORNIA. SB THREE RECOGNIZES THIS CRITICAL VOID AND ESTABLISH A STATE LEVEL LEADERSHIP POSITION TO CONFRONT THESE CHALLENGES. IMPORTANTLY IT ALSO REPRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY AND MEANS FOR THE STATE TO ARTICULATE A LONG RANGE VISION FOR HIGHER EDUCATION WITH CLEAR ACTIONABLE GOALS FOR ENSURING COLLEGE ACCESS STUDENT SUCCESS. IN CLOSING RACIAL AND EGIONAL EQUITY GAPS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO MEETING FUTURE WORK FORCE NEEDS. THANK YOU AND WE RESPECTFULLY AT ARCHER I ABOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

THE BILL BILL HAS BEEN MOVED CENTER ALLEN WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK IT'S KIND OF THING FROM ARE A FANTASTIC SENATE COMMITTEE STAFF. AND THAT WITHOUT I RESEARCH HAS RIVALS VERY GOOD THANK YOU. ALL RIGHTS TO DO PALS TO G. O.. MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. I AM TOO SB THREE THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED A GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION LEYVA AYE LEYVA AYE WELL. WILK I CHIANG GLASSELL. WRESTLE AYE GLAZER. GLAZER AYE MCGUIRE PAN. PAN HI. BUT WE HAVE A A LITTLE BIT OF OUT F ORDER HERE WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK UP -- TO ITEM NUMBER TWO SO CENTER ALLEN I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A COMMITTEE CHAIR. CAN SENATOR GLAZER PRESENT OR DO YOU WANT TO GO DOWN TO YOUR TO NINETY SIX OF WHAT I'M TO DO IS BE HERE WITH SIDES IN A GLAZER FOR SB TWO WERE JOINT AUTHORS OF THIS -- ONE IF THIS DOES GO QUICKLY I'LL TRY THE OTHER BILL IF OTHERWISE I'LL COME BACK -- VERY GOOD WE'RE HAPPY TO ACCOMMODATE YOU HEAR ON THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. SENATOR GLAZER OF PRESENTING SB TO PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. MADAM CHAIR WANTED THANK -- YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF AND YOU FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS LEGISLATION HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE DISCUSSED IN THE ANALYSIS. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A STATEWIDE DATA SYSTEM TO TRACK INDIVIDUAL STUDENT PROGRESS FROM PRESCHOOL THROUGH COLLEGE AND INTO THE WRK FORCE. SPECIFICALLY THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE AN ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE -- THAT WOULD CONVENE A COMMITTEE REVIEW COMMITTEE MADE UP OF VARIOUS EDUCATION STAKEHOLDERS -- TO ADVISE THAT OFFICE THE LEGISLATURE ANY ADMINISTRATION ON THE CREATE EXPIRATION OF THIS DATABASE. AS YOU ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA COLLECTS A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF DATA ABOUT STUDENTS HOWEVER THE DATA COLLECTED. IS MAINTAINING SYSTEMS THAT ARE NOT AT ALL CONNECTED. AS A RESULT OF THESE DISCONNECTS IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT STUDENT PROGRESS IS OFTEN IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCESS. A STARK EXAMPLE OF WHY THIS IS NEEDED. THIRTY TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO QUALIFIED FOR CSU ADMISSION LAST FALL WERE DENIED. BUT WITHOUT A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT BECAME OF THEM DID THEY GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO THEY GO TO A PRIVATE UNIVERSITY DID THEY MOVE OUT OF STATE. THEY JUST ENTER THE WORK FORCE WITHOUT A COLLEGE EDUCATION. THESE INFORMATION GAPS ARE SICK ARE SIGNIFICANT WEAKNESS IN CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT APPROACH WE'RE UNABLE TO ANSWER IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT STUDENT PROGRESS AND OUTCOMES -- AND AT THAT THERE'S MANY EXAMPLES OF THAT THAT UP. OF THESE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT WE CAN ANSWER WITH DATA AND MY WITH THIS IS WILL PROVIDE SOME OF THAT BACKGROUND. OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE BETTER OFF IF THEY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST -- WITH PREVIOUS STUDENTS THEY'LL BE BETTER OFF THE DATA IS AVAILABLE TO THEM PUTTING THEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND WE AS POLICY MAKERS WILL BE BETTER OFF CRAFTING POLICY INFORMED BY DATA. WITHOUT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND PLEASED TO HAVE SOME -- WITNESSES WITH WITH ME TO TESTIFY BUT I WANT TO INVITE MY JOINT AUTHORED A SENATOR ALLEN TO SAY SOME THINGS. THE PERCENT A GLAZER CENTER ALLEN THANK YOU MY MANAGER ME THIS THIS -- MERRY'S VERY NICELY WITH THAT SB THREE NINETY PROJECT THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT OF THAT BILL HI AS YOU'LL NOTICE ON PAGE FIVE I'VE THIS BILL THIS BIZ FOLDED INTO WELL WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE OFFICE OF HIGHER EDUCATION CORONATION. ACCOUNTABILITY PERFORMANCE IS ALL ABOUT DATA COLLECTION SO WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO SERVE OUR STUDENTS. THANK YOU CENTER ALLEN WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE PROCEDURE TWO MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR LEYVA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME -- MY NAME IS RAY YES AND UP TO FIVE AND I'M THE INTERIM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA CAN. PETE'S HIGHER EDUCATION FOR A STRONG ECONOMY I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL TWO INTRODUCED BY SENATORS GLAZIER AN ALLEN WHICH WOULD CONVENE A REVIEW COMMITTEE TO ADVISE ON THE STRAPLESS MEN OF THE STATE ONE LONGITUDINAL STUDENT DATABASE. TODAY THE NEED TO IMPROVE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND OUTCOMES HAS NEVER BEEN MORE URGENT THE DEMAND FOR A HIGHLY SKILLED WORKFORCE GROWS WHILE MOST CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLE WITH BURGEONING INCOME INEQUALITY. OF OPTIONS LAY BEFORE POLICYMAKERS TO BETTER SUIT IF STUDENTS AND FAMILIES BUT CALIFORNIA'S DECISION MAKERS ARE ACTING IN AN INFORMATION VACUUM. THE STATE HAS A VERY LIMITED ABILITY TO DIAGNOSE ITS CHALLENGES IN EDUCATION -- INVEST WISELY IN SOLUTIONS AND THEN COMPREHENSIVELY ASSESS THE IMPACTS OF THOSE INVESTMENTS WITHOUT IN FULLY INTEGRATED TOP TO BOTTOM DATA INFRASTRUCTURE CALIFORNIA'S LEADERS LACKED THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO BEST. SERVE STUDENTS WORKERS AND THE ECONOMY -- WE SUPPORT SB TWO BECAUSE SYSTEMATICALLY INTEGRATING DATA FROM PRESCHOOL TO WORKFORCE IS A KEY STEP FOR CALIFORNIA TO MODERNIZE. THE EDUCATION SECTOR OF THE LACK OF A COMPREHENSIVE DATA SYSTEM PREVENTS POLICYMAKERS FROM PINPOINTING WHERE CALIFORNIANS FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE EDUCATION TO EMPLOYMENT PIPELINE. HOW THAT VARIES BY RACE GENDER REGION AND INCOME AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WHY IT HAPPENED IT'S MIND BOGGLING THAT OUR STATE CAN'T ANSWER SEEMINGLY FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS LIKE? IN A GIVEN YEAR HOW MANY KIND OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES ENROLLED IN COLLEGE IN THE NEXT FALL BECAUSE K. TWELVE AND COLLEGE DATA SYSTEMS DON'T SPEAK. FULLY TO ONE ANOTHER -- THE SEGMENTS ARE ARE YOU. INDEPENDENTLY HOLD RICH DATA BUT THE SEGMENTED APPROACH LIMITS UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE EDUCATION WORK FOR SYSTEMS COMPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER SB TO CREATE AN INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE THESE DATA ACTIONABLE FOR PURPOSES OF IMPROVING OUTCOMES AND REDUCING DISPARITIES -- IT CAREFULLY THINK THROUGH THE INCLUSION OF APPROPRIATE ROLES OF KEY STAKEHOLDERS LIKE THE SEGMENTS SOCIAL SERVICES WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT STUDENT ASSOCIATIONS AND IT ALSO ADDRESSES ISSUES THAT OFTEN ARISE IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT DATA LIKE PRIVACY AND PUBLIC ACCESS -- SO FOR CALIFORNIA PROGRESS IN THIS AREA IS LONG OVERDUE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THE MORNING CERRILLOS WITH EACH PLUS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THERE ARE SEE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY IN SUPPORT. TWENTY MANY RODRIGUEZ WITH THE EDUCATION TRUST WEST IN SUPPORT. GABRIEL GARCIA WITH THE SOUTHEAST ASIA RESOURCE ACTION CENTER ALSO IN SUPPORT. MAY WASHINGTON WITH CAL STATE STUDENTS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING WITH ALL THE OTHER METALLIC IN KATE WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT -- HI ADAM HOW TO BE A UC DAVIS UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT WITH YOU SEE SOME ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT OF LIKE THAT AS A CURRENT STUDENT -- CREATING SUCH DATABASES WOULD BE IMMENSELY HELPFUL AT ALL LEVELS THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. SEEING AND HEARING THAT IS BROUGHT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS YES DOCTOR PAN. I THANK YOU AND CERTAINLY -- APPRECIATE -- THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED BY HAVING ACTUALLY A MORE COMPLETE DATABASE WHERE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO BETTER TRACK -- OUTCOMES AND OTHER TYPES OF MEASURES. BECAUSE ONE QUESTIONS I JUST HAD WAS IS THAT IN TERMS OF THE DATA SAID IT SAYS THE DATA RESIDES WITH THE OWNERSHIP FOR STILL RESIDES WITH EACH SEGMENT. SO -- IN TERMS OF FOOTBALL I GUESS ONE QUESTION WOULD BE IS IS THAT -- IT IS THIS DATA GOING TO BE AVAILABLE. YOU MENTION ANALYSIS AND I'M NOT SURE WHICH KNOW WHETHER THE BODY THAT'S CLOSER TO ITS OWN BY EACH SEGMENT AND THE BODY TO SOAR ACCORDING TO DATA AT THIS OFFICE THE OFFICE WHICH YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT THE PREVIOUS BILL -- AGAIN HAVE THE ANALYTICAL CAPACITY OR GOING TO MAKE THE DATA AVAILABLE YOU KNOW WHAT'S APPROPRIATE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AVAILABLE TO LET'S SAY RESEARCHERS ACCURACY CAN DO MORE DEEP DIVES INTO THE DATA. AND IF IT'S QUOTE OWNED BY EACH SEGMENT IS IS ARE WE GOING TO RUN INTO SOME CHALLENGES WITH SOMEONE'S GONNA GET PERMISSION FROM EACH SEGMENT NORTH ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE COMPILED DATA. SITES I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. THROUGH THROUGH THE CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR PAT I THINK THE HOPE WOULD BE THAT THIS COMMITTEE THAT'S GOING TO BE CREATED TO TO DIG DOWN AND AND FIGURE ALL THESE THINGS OUT WILL INCORPORATE THE QUESTION IF YOU JUST RAISED IN THAT. IN THAT REVIEW AND THAT WOULD BE MY EXPECTATION GOOD QUESTION AND DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW THE IT'S ALL GOING TO FIT TOGETHER BUT THAT'S THEIR ASSIGNMENT IS TO DO THAT UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THIS HIGHER EDUCATION OFFICE. OKAY SIDE EIGHT SO I THINK THAT THE APPRECIATE THAT -- CERTAINLY I UNDERSTAND THE ROLE IN TERMS OWNERSHIP Y EACH SEGMENT -- BUT OUT SO I'M SURE THAT DOESN'T BECOME A BARRIER SO I MEAN WE WANT TO HAVE A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SEGMENT TO SEGMENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE DATA TO INFORM THEIR OWN ACTIVITIES -- SO WHY BE SURE WE'RE NOT STRUCTURING IT IN A WAY IN THE ACTUAL BILL THAT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THE AIMS THAT YOU DESIRE FOR THE BILL AND I THINK MANY OF US WHO. WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THE BILL WOULD LIKE TO SEE AS WELL THANK YOU. THEY'RE GETTING CENTER PAN ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS VERY GOOD WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. WELL I I BY HERE YOU AND I Y. PLOT. AS WELL AS WE WORK TOGETHER AND AS BETWEEN THREE LET'S WE WILL MAKE SURE -- TO TO TO ADDRESS THAT AYE AYE DEALS WITH THE CHANCE TO SEE PACK -- THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD AND SO AM I IT'S THE POINT VERY WELL TAKEN WILL WILL WORK WITH YOU TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE.

FINANCIAL AID THROUGH THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM WHILE THERE I SENT A SILENT CASE IS PENDING AS WE KNOW WE HAVE -- NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS COMING INTO THE STATE WERE FLEEING PERSECUTION THEY ARE FILING FOR ASYLUM IN CURRENT INDICATE ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT THE THAT THERE'S A QUITE ABOUT WHAT BACKLOG MY DUE TO THE LACK OF ASYLUM OFFICERS. NOW -- MANY OF THE SOUNDS OCCURS IN OUR STATE OUR PERSPECTIVE A CURRENT COLLEGE STUDENTS WISHING TO ATTEND THE UNIVERSITY BUT THEY FACE. HURDLES BECAUSE OF SIGNIFICANT COSTS ARE RIGHT NOWTHE FACTS -- IS AVAILABLE FOR STUDENTS SUCH AS US CITIZENS LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENTS THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ALREADY GRANTED ASYLUM IN THE U.

AS A STUDENT I HAVE PERSONALLY LIVES THROUGH TOO MUCH PAIN TO HAVE NOT TAKEN UP THIS OPPORTUNITY TO FLY UP HERE FROM LA. TO SHARE WITH YOU MY EXPERIENCE ISN'T TO TESTIFY. YOU SEE I APPLY FOR ASYLUM IN JULY. TWENTY FIFTEEN IT'S BEEN ALMOST FOUR YEARS AND I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE AN INTERVIEW NOTIFICATION FOR MY CASE TO BE ADJUDICATED. AND THAT HAS LEFT ME WITH NO FINANCIAL AID THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE COLLEGE CAREER. ESPECIALLY DURING A GREAT A TIME OF GREAT FINANCIAL STRUGGLE THAT MY FAMILY HAS BEEN GOING THROUGH. BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF TUITION I HAD TO BECOME A PART TIME STUDENT AND WORKED TWO JOBS I MEAN SIMULTANEOUSLY SUPPORT MYSELF. I SPENT OVER FIVE YEARS INSTEAD OF FOUR THIRTEEN MY COLLEGE DEGREE BECAUSE OF MY PART TIME STATUS. EVEN THEN I'VE HAD TO MAKE SOME SEVERE SACRIFICES AS A STUDENT I'VE HAD TO SKIP MEALS AND RELY ON OUR CAMPUS FOOD CLOSET. I'VE COUCH SERVED FOR THREE MONTHS TO SAVE RENT OF AVOIDED PURCHASING REQUIRED TEXTBOOKS FOR SOME OF MY COURSES. BECAUSE I COULDN'T AFFORD THEM. AND IN EVERY WAY I HAVE DIMINISH MY EXPENSES TO THE VERY BARE MINIMUM NEEDED FOR SURVIVAL. FOR TOO MANY NIGHTS I'VE GONE TO SLEEP. WONDERING HOW WHAT WITH THE NEXT DAY WOULD HOLD. FOR ON TOO MANY INSTANCES I'VE WONDERED. WHETHER PURSUING A COLLEGE DEGREE WAS WORTH THE PAIN THAT I WAS CAUSING MY FAMILY. AND MY EXTENDED FRIENDS. BY CUT BY MAY HAVE COME THROUGH THIS PROCESS WITH MY DEGREE BUT I PERSONALLY KNOW OTHERS IN THE CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHAT OUGHT TO OUT OF PURSUING HIGHER EDUCATION. FOR THE SAKE OF DELAYED INTERVIEWED TIMES FOR ASYLUM CASE AND FOR THE LACK OF FINANCIAL AID. TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR CAL GRANTS WITH INCREDIBLY HELP US TO STAY ENROLLED IN COLLEGE TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD BASIC NEEDS LIKE FOOD AND HOUSING. AND TO COME OUT OF THIS PROCESS EDUCATED READY TO PURSUE A FULFILLING CAREER. JUST ONE LAST COMMENT AS ASYLUM SEEKERS ARE COMMITTED TO STAYING IN THIS COUNTRY WE'RE COMMITTED TO GIVING BACK TO THE STATE. BEING BARRED FROM ATTAINING A COLLEGE DEGREE HURTS US AND THE STATE EQUALITY. TODAY I ASK YOU TO EXERCISE COMPASSION SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS.

GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AS A FORMER EDUCATOR TODAY I AM PROUD TO PRESENT SB FOUR FORTY THREE AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT WILL EXPAND FUNDING TO TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. STUDENTS TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AT THE WAITED SERVE CHILDREN WHO WERE OTHERWISE LEFT OUT OF THE SCHOOL. WHEN THE ENTRY AGE FOR KINDERGARTEN WAS CHANGED UNLIKE OTHER PRE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TIKI PROGRAMS REQUIRE FULLY CREDENTIALED CERTIFIED TEACHERS WHO HAVE BACHELOR'S DEGREES? STUDENTS ANTI K. ALSO BENEFIT FROM AN EMPHASIS ON SOCIAL LIFE STATION MENTAL MENTAL HEALTH SKILLS AND PRINT ISSUES THAT ARE ABSENT FROM OTHER PROGRAMS. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT TAKING HAS A POSITIVE ACADEMIC OUTCOMES. FOR STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATE TAKE IT HAS ALSO BEEN PROVEN EFFECTIVE FOR ALL STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATE WITH EVEN GREATER IMPACT. ON LANGUAGE SKILLS FOR INTERESTING WHICH LEARNERS AND MATHEMATICAL SKILLS FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. THE STATE PROVIDES FUNDING FOR T. CASE STUDENTS WHO ARE BORN BETWEEN SEPTEMBER SECOND DECEMBER SECOND JUST AS THE THEY DO FOR KINDERGARTEN. HOWEVER STUDENTS ANTI CARE ARE ALSO I'M SORRY HOWEVER STUDENTS TO TAKE A WHO ARE BORN DECEMBER THIRD OR LATER ONLY GENERATE FUNDING AFTER THE FIFTH BIRTHDAY. WHILE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ABLE TO BACK FILL THE FUNDING SHORTFALLS BUT THERE GENERAL FUND THIS IS NOT REALISTIC FOR ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THIS HAS CREATED A FUNDING SHORTFALL ONCE AGAIN AND DESCENT OF ISIS SCHOOL DISTRICTS FROM AND FROM THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE THEIR FIFTH BIRTHDAY. IN THE LATER PART OF THE SCHOOL YEAR SB FOUR FORTY THREE WOULD ALLOW BUT NOT MANDATE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO EXPAND THEIR T. K. PROGRAM. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE FUNDING FOR STUDENTS WERE ENROLLED IN TKD AND HAVE THEIR FIFTH BIRTHDAY ONCE AGAIN AFTER DECEMBER SECOND CUT OFF BY ALLOWING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO COLLECT AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. FOR STUDENTS WHO TURN FIVE AFTER DECEMBER SECOND TICKET WOULD EXPAND IN AREAS ARE NOT ABLE TO AFFORD THIS RICH INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM MADAM CHAIR. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE TWO WITNESSES WHO WOULD LIKE TO OFFER THEIR TESTIMONY ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. KAREN MAN SHIP PRINCIPAL RESEARCHER AT THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH AND DOCTOR CHARLES HIM MEN FROM WITH CAMINO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THANK YOU. BECAUSE AND A RUBIO PLEASE PROCEDURE WHICH HAVE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S CHUCK CAM AND I'M IN MY FIFTH YEAR OF SUPERINTENDENT THE WEST UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT -- I ASK FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING A LITTLE UNDER THE WEATHER SO. IF YOU'LL BEAR WITH ME ON THAT -- APPROXIMATELY FOUR YEARS AGO WE HAD A NEIGHBORING SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT WAS UNABLE TO CONTINUE THEIR DAY CARE PROGRAM IN OUR SCHOOL BOARD WANTED TO OFFER UP. OUR TIKI PROGRAM IS A SOLUTION FOR SOME OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. SO THEY DECIDED HIM I WILL TAKE THE TIME OUR BUDGET WAS WAS HEALTHY FOR A SCHOOL DISTRICT SO WE DECIDED TO ALLOW ALL COMERS. WHO TURN FIVE IN THE PREVIOUS SCHOOL YEAR TO COME INTO OUR T. K.? BUT WE DIDN'T REALIZE IS THAT OUR T. K. WOULD GROW BY 60%. SO WE TOOK AN ADDITIONAL 60% OF STUDENTS AND THAT DIDN'T QUALIFY FOR THE FULL YEAR FUNDING OBVIOUSLY THIS BECAME A BURDEN ON OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT WE WERE ABLE TO CARRY IT FOR THREE YEARS. GENTLY WE'VE HAD TO NOW BILL THE WAITING LIST FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR WE WE CAN NO LONGER SUPPLANT -- THAT THE YOUNGER STUDENTS NOW IN OUR MIND. I WILL TELL YOU I'VE I'VE SHARED THE STORY WITH SUPERINTENDENTS ACROSS THE STATE I THINK WE'RE ALL ON THIS PRETTY MUCH ON THE SAME FIELD. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO US THAT YOU HAVE HALF OF THE CLASS OF STUDENTS. IT'S GOING INTO KINDERGARTEN THE FOLLOWING YEAR THAT'S ALLOWED TO HAVE T. K. AND THE PREP WORK GOING INTO KINDERGARTEN. YET WE'RE DENYING THE OTHER HALF OF THAT CLASS THIS GOING INTO THE SAME CLASSROOM THE FOLLOWING YEAR BUT IS THE NINETY K.. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING FOR OUR OUR LIMITED FUNDING -- I'M SURE YOU'RE GONNA HEAR SOME RESULTS VERY SHORTLY THE T. K. PROGRAM IS OF A QUALITY PROGRAM IS CREDENTIALED TEACHERS IT HAS A BASED CURRICULUM. I CAN TAKE FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE -- OUR PARENTS OUR COMMUNITY ARE THRILLED TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY AND I HOPE IN THE FUTURE I WON'T HAVE TO BUILD THAT WAITING LIST BECAUSE IT'S IT'S VERY DESTRUCTIVE TO OUR COMMUNITY -- I TAKE OUT THE LAST SINGLE I WILL CLOSE WITH IS THE OLD ADAGE NO AND I I UNDERSTAND. HOW THIS HOW IT WORKED WITH THE MARIN BOARD OUR OWN BUDGETS? THERE'S AN OLD ADAGE BY SUPERINTENDENTS AND SAY YOU KNOW SCHOOL BOARD CAN DO ANYTHING THEY WANT. THEY JUST CAN'T DO EVERYTHING SO I CAN SEE THAT TO THE COMMITTEE I REALIZE THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGING ENTITIES FOR FOR FUNDING. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- AN EFFECTIVE PROGRAM -- THAT SHOWS SIGNIFICANT RESULTS IN SHOULD BE OPEN TO THE ENTIRE CLASS OF FIVE YEAR OLDS GOING INTO KINDERGARTEN RATHER THAN JUST HALF THANK YOU VERY GOOD THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. A GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KAREN MENTIONED I'M A PRINCIPAL RESEARCHER AT AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH. WITH OUR A. I. R. TEAM I LET THE STATEWIDE STUDY OF TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN FROM 200-014-32000. SIXTEEN AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF WHAT WE FOUND TO INFORM YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS FALL. THE STUDY COMPARED OUTCOMES IN KINDERGARTEN FOR KIDS YOUR AGE ELIGIBLE FOR KINDERGARTEN SO THOSE BORN BEFORE DECEMBER SECOND. TWO KIDS WHO WERE SIMILAR IN AGE BUT JUST MISSED THE AGE CUTOFF FOR TKA MOST OF WHOM ATTENDED ANOTHER CENTER BASED BECAME PROGRAM. THIS IS A VERY RIGOROUS DESIGN FOR STUDY AND INCLUDED OVER SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE FOUND UNDERSTANDING T. K. GIVE STUDENTS A THREE MONTH LEARNING ADVANTAGE OVER THEIR NANTI K. PEERS AND MATH SKILLS A KINDERGARTEN ENTRY. T. K. ALSO SHOULDN'T IMPACT ON STUDENTS LITERACY SKILLS PUTTING THEM AHEAD OF THEIR NANTI K. PAIRS BY SIX MONTHS I CAN -- AN ENTRY AND SHOWING A PERSISTING IN FACT AT THE END OF THE YEAR. A RECENT STUDY BY CHRISTOS AT RAND COMPARING THE TWO K. PROGRAMS OTHER PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS AND SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED. CAME TO SIMILAR CONCLUSIONS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE AND CHILDREN SOCIAL SKILLS AS RATING RATED BY TEACHERS BETWEEN TWO K. IN COMPARISON CREEK STUDENTS. TWO K. HAS A PARTICULARLY STRONG IMPACT TO SENATOR MENTIONED ON SOME STUDENTS TO MAKE UP A REALLY LARGE PORTION OF OUR STUDENT BODY IN CALIFORNIA. WE SAW VERY POSITIVE EFFECTS ON ENGLISH LANGUAGE SKILLS FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS AND ALSO ON MATH SKILLS FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS THAT WE NOTED IN THE STUDY WAS THAT VARIATIONS IN THE SPECIFIC ELEMENTS CITY KAY. SO SMALL CHANGES IN TEACHER CHILD RATIOS CLASSROOM OBSERVATION RATINGS FOR USE OF PARTICULAR INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES SUCH A SMALL GROUPS DID NOT CHANGE THE IMPACT THAT T QUê HAD FOR STUDENTS. SO WE THINK THIS MAY BE BECAUSE THE ELEMENTS THAT TICKET CLASSROOMS ALL HAVE IN COMMON. FOR EXAMPLE LOCATION AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS THAT MAY FACILITATE TRANSITIONS AND KINDERGARTEN -- CERTIFICATED AND WELL EDUCATED TEACHERS THE MAJORITY OF HIM TAUGHT KINDERGARTEN BEFORE. AND ALSO NINE MEANS TESTED CLASSROOMS WHERE CHILDREN OF ALL INCOME LEVELS CAN ATTEND TOGETHER. MAYBE THE MAIN DRIVERS OF THE PROGRAM'S IMPACT. THE STUDY FOCUSED ON CHILDREN IN THE CURRENT T. K. H. WINDOW NOT YOUNGER CHILDREN SUCH AS THIS RESURGENT ET QUEPROGRAMS. BUT BECAUSE WE SEE STRONG AND CONSISTENT IMPACTS OF T. K. FOR CHILDREN WITH THESE WHEN OUR BIRTHDAYS WE BELIEVE THAT THE SUGGESTS THAT DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE AND RESPONSIVE ET QUE PROGRAMS. MAY ALSO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JEFF AKA REPRESENTING THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

I THANK YOU AND AND AT FIRST OF ALL -- SIR RUBIO I'D APPRECIATE -- THAT -- YEAH YEARS -- THAT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IN TERMS OF GETTING MORE -- FUNDING AND SUPPORT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- FOR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN I GUESS THAT THE DID HAVE A QUESTION -- WELL WE DON'T HAVE SOMEONE COMING UP TO TESTIFY. I KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME CONCERN IN THE CHILD CARE COMMUNITY -- ABOUT THIS AND I CAN JUST SPEAK PERHAPS. TO CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CHILD CARE COMMUNITY ABOUT. BASICALLY I THINK THE CONCERN IS THAT WE'RE MOVING TO QUE TO YOUNGER YOUNGER AGES AND AND DOES A PEDIATRICIAN AND I KNOW YEARS AS A TEACHER YOU'D UNDERSTAND THAT -- CHILDREN -- DEVELOPMENTAL CURVE RIGHT SO -- THE THE FOCUS OF THEIR EXPERIENCE -- NATION SHIFT DEPENDING ON WHAT AGE SO WE KNOW HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL -- SHE CERTAINLY HAS VERY STRONG RESULTS -- AND SO FORTH -- BUY ONE BE SURE TO AS WERE YOU KNOW THIS INTERFACE BETWEEN -- SO EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND CHILD CARE AND THE AND NTK IS SOMETHING THAT -- WE WILL BE SURE WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO GET RIGHT SO I MUST THAT WE SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IN TERMS OF FEATURES SCHOOL DISTRICTS GET MORE MONEY. TO HELP SUPPORT THIRTY K. PROGRAM BUT ALSO -- JUST ONE TOUCH ON THE SET THE INTERFACE AND INTERACTION BETWEEN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND TJ. SO CAN YOU SEE PERHAPS THAT CAN YOU ADDRESS ANY CONVERSATIONS YOU HAD ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN FOR YOUR QUESTION AND WE DO HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT I'M GOING TO DEFER TRY EXPERTS HERE TO DISCUSS. THEIR INTERACTION EFFECTS ON DEVELOPMENTALLY READY CHILDREN. PLEASE. THANK YOU SENATOR -- I I'M JUST A REFER BACK TO MY QUICK COMMENT WHICH IS I AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT DEVELOPMENTAL AGE AGES. BUT I ALSO WANT TO REMIND THAT THAT COHORT. OF KINDERGARTNERS IT'S ALL GOING TOGETHER SO YOU'RE WE ARE SEPARATED HALF INTO A DIFFERENT PROGRAMMERS THE TICKET AND WE BELIEVE THE TICKET FOR STRONG BUT I'M GONNA ASK ATTORNEYS CAN IT'S A NEW OVERSEAS OUR TICKET PROGRAM IN THE WEST UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. JUST TO BRIEFLY DISCUSS WHAT TRAINING THE TICKET TEACHERS HAVE TO HELP FACILITATE THAT QUESTION. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU SENATOR -- THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION -- I AND I KNOW THAT THAT. YOU'RE AWARE THAT ARE A T. TEACHERS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE TWENTY FOUR UNITS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. AND WE DO USE THE PRESCHOOL -- CALIFORNIA FRAMEWORK A THEY ARE TRAINED IN THAT AS WELL AS I DO THE MANY MANY DEVELOPMENTAL -- ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM. SO THE READER -- DOESN'T REALLY COME INTO MUCH LATER WHEN YOU WALK INTO OUR T. K. CLASSROOMS THEY LOOK VERY MUCH PLAY BASED AND DEVELOPMENTAL. A VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT MANY OF OUR EVEN OUR KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOMS LOOK LIKE. AND AND AND JUST WANTED TO BE CLEAR THAT -- I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THAT THE TEACHERS ARE INVOLVED IN TJ -- DO A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THESE ISSUES SO THAT'S NOT SO MUCH THE DIRECT CONCERN I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW THIS INTERFACE HAPPENS. AND SO THAT'S WHY I WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATORS THE CHILD CARE FOLKS ABOUT EXACTLY. HOW WE'RE? PUTTING THESE PIECES TOGETHER AND RECOGNIZING THAT -- ACTUALLY OFTENTIMES MANY OF THE STUDENTS THAT -- YOU -- WORK WITH -- YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS IS THE BEST pSHOWS AND SO FORTH AND YOU'RE NOT GETTING FUNDED FOR IT SO A SO WE WON'T BE SURE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS GET SUPPORT -- SAME TIME -- IN THE IT OUT TO YOU THAT -- IN SOME OF THE OTHER ROLES I'VE HAD NO WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WATER STANDARDS FOR LIKE PHYSICAL FACILITIES THAT WERE REQUIRING AND ENTER AND AND AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THAT WE'VE HAD THE ELECTRICITY WE SAID ABOUT EDUCATION. SO JUST. WANNA BE SURE THAT THAT CONVERSATION IS HAPPENING IS THIS BILLS ROLLING FORWARD BECAUSE IT. STILL -- A SUPPORT INTEND TO THE BILL AND BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THERE'S A CONVERSATION THAT. NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN RELATION TO BE SURE THIS BILL SUCCESSFUL THAT I'M NOT QUITE. SURE ABOUT YET SO IF YOU SEE ALL OF YOU BEING HERE AND YOUR TO REPRESENT THE ONE SIDE BUT I'M NOT HEARING THE SOME HEARING FROM SOME FOLKS IN THE ON THAT IT WAS THE OTHER SITES ONLY.

FOR COMING OUT HERE TODAY AND THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS FOR HEAR ME TODAY -- BUT JUST WANT TO CLOSE WITH THE EXPAND ET QUE WILL HELP ELIMINATE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IS FASHION ARE LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES SB FOUR FORTY THREE WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR BIRTHDAY WILL BE TREATED EQUALLY FOR PURPOSES OF FUNDING. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIFLE THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO TO HAVE A MOTION. SO MOVED BY SENATOR DRAWS -- MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ITEM TEN SB FOUR FOUR THREE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA. AYE LEYVA AYE WILK. CHEN THANK CHIANG I'M TO WRESTLE GRESHAM AYE GLAZER. MCGUIRE PAN. CAN I BELIEVE THAT BELONG CALL CALL CENTER RUBIO [inaudible] CENTER SKINNER. PLEASE JOIN US YOU'VE BEEN VERY PATIENT. WE'RE GOING TO HEAR SB. TWO ZERO SIX PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ALSO HAVE MY CO AUTHOR SENATOR BRADFORD. WHO CENTER BRED FOR IF YOU WANNA IT WHICHEVER TO WOULD BE AT THE TABLE OR THE PODIUM IT'S UP TO YOU [inaudible] OKAY YEAH -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS VERY HAPPY TO BE PRESENTING SB TWO ZERO SIX TO YOU TODAY AS WE WRAP UP OR FACE THE LAST WEEK IN MARCH MADNESS -- FIRST I WANT TO START WITH I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS ON HAD A REQUIRING THAT THE AGENTS BE LICENSED AND THAT THEY ABIDE BY ETHICAL STANDARDS. BUT IN LIEU OF AMENDMENT HEY WHAT WE WILL DO IS REMOVE THE REFERENCE TO THE COMPENSATION CAP THE BILL THANK YOU. AND THEN OUT TO PROCEED -- MANY OF US MAY NOT REALIZE BUT COLLEGE ATHLETES STRUGGLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET. IN THE SAME WAY THAT MOST COLLEGE STUDENTS DO TODAY -- BUT UNLIKE OTHER STUDENTS COLLEGE ATHLETES OR DVI ONLY COLLEGE ATHLETES THAT PARTICIPATE IN NC TO A SPORTS ARE THE ONLY CATEGORY OF STUDENTS THAT ARE COMPLETELY BARRED FROM MAKING ANY MONEY FROM THEIR TALENT. SO FINE MUSIC STUDENT. I CAN STILL GET EARNINGS FOR PERFORMANCE IF I'M SO FORTUNATE TO HAVE THAT ABILITY OR THAT TALENT. IF I'M A COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENT I DEVELOP AN APP I CAN MARKET IT MAKE MONEY OFF OF IT. I FIND THE DEBATE TEAM STUDENT AND I'M SO FORTUNATE TO BE ENTREPRENEURIAL ENOUGH TO GET -- TO ALLOW MYSELF TO GET PAID FOR SPEAKING GIGS I CAN DO THAT. AND YET I CAN ALSO COMPETE. IN INTER COLUSA INTERCOLLEGIATE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THAT TOWN I HAVE. ONLY COLLEGE INCOME IS COLLEGE ATHLETES ARE PROHIBITED AND THEY ARE PROHIBITED BY AN ENTITY THAT EARNED IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN OVER ONE POINT ONE BILLION. FOR ITS RELATIONSHIP TO COLLEGE ATHLETES SO THE VERY TALENT THAT THE NC TWO EIGHT AND OTHERS MAKE BILLIONS OFF IS PROHIBITED FROM EARNING ANY INCOME THEMSELVES. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT DOES NOT REQUIRE? OUR COLLEGES TO HIRE THE ATHLETES ARE GIVEN THEM -- HEY RATHER IT PUTS OUR COLLEGE ATHLETES ON THE SAME LEVEL AS OLYMPIC ATHLETES ARE ALLOWED WHICH IS THAT THEY CAN PURSUE SPONSORSHIPS ARE ENDORSEMENTS OR GET AN AGENT -- IN WITHOUT A ONE ALLOW MY WITNESSES TO SPEAK AND THEN I CAN GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS IN MY CLOSER IN QUESTIONS. WHEN MY INNER AND PERHAPS ARMS SENATOR BRADFORD BEFORE THE WITNESSES HE MIGHT ADD AND THEN WE'LL HAVE TO WITNESSES? UNDER BRADFORD PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AND ALSO WANT TO THANK SENATOR SKINNER FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. I'M PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THE FAIR PAY. PAY AND PLAYBACK WHICH IS MORE THAN ABOUT SPORTS IT'S A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE -- AND IT'S ISSUED JUST BASIC FAIRNESS FOR DECADES YOUNG ATHLETES HAVE BEEN GENERATING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES IN CORPORATE SPONSORED BUT MANY. ARE NOT ONLY IN DURING THE DAILY CHALLENGES OF COLLEGIATE. A COLLEGIATE ATHLETES THEY ARE ARE STRUGGLING JUST TO GET DID BY FINANCIALLY IT'S A TIME TO WRITE THIS HISTORIC WRONG. STUDENT ATHLETES OF COLOR SUFFERED DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF THESE COMPENSATION RESTRICTIONS AND OFTEN SUFFER THE LOWEST GRADUATION RATES BLACKMAIL COLLEGIATE. ATHLETES MADE UP ONLY TWO POINT ROAD ACROSS THE SIXTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS THAT COMPRISE THE POWER. FIVE BUT THEY COMPRISE OVER 50% OF THE BASKETBALL AND FOOTBALL TEAMS. FOR HEAVILY FINANCIAL GAIN. INSTITUTIONS ARE HIGHLY PRIORITIZED SPORTS ARE MAKING A GREAT EFFORT TO RECRUIT BLACK MALE COLLEGIATE ATHLETES BUT ARE NOT PROVIDING THEM WITH THE SPORT I MEAN SUPPORT SORRY. ONCE THE INTER COLLEGE OR EVEN AFTER THEY LEAVE COLLEGE THEY NEED BOTH FINANCIAL AND ACADEMIC ASSISTANCE. YOU HAVE WORKERS GENERATING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BUT BEING DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE JUST COMPENSATION. AND AGAIN STUDENT ATHLETES ARE ONLY GROUP OF STUDENTS WITH RESTRICTIONS. ON WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO EARNED BY USING THEIR TALENTS -- FOR THIS IS NOT A EQUITABLE NOR FAIR SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. HE SAID THE BRADFORD WITNESSES OF IN SUPPORT YOU BOTH HAVE TWO MINUTES. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME IS HALEY HANSSON AND I IN THE FORMER STANFORD VOLLEYBALL PLAYER I'M CURRENTLY STILL ENROLLED AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY. I HAD TO MEDICALLY RETIRED DUE TO BRAIN INJURY -- BECAUSE TO DURING MY TIME AS AN ATHLETE THERE I A COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL I WAS A TOP BRING TO CREATE IN THE NATION AND A PLAYER ON THE USA WOMEN'S NATIONAL TEAM. I WENT ON TO EARN AMERICA ALL AMERICAN THE NATIONAL FRESH FOR THE OF THE YEAR HONORS DURING MY FIRST YEAR AT STANFORD AND PLAN TO GRADUATE EARLY IN ORDER TO PURSUE A PROFESSIONAL VOLLEYBALL CAREER OVERSEAS. HOWEVER THAT CREER WAS CUT SHORT BEFORE IT EVEN STARTED -- AT AGE TWENTY I HAD DOES BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF BRAIN INJURY ISSUES AND MEDICAL EXPENSES ARE IN MY FUTURE AND LOST MY ABILITY TO MONETIZE THE FUTURE CAREER I HAD ONCE HOPED OF HOPPING. UNLIKE MOST COLLEGIATE ATHLETES MY FAMILY HAS SPENT MANY MANY MANY MANY MANY HOURS -- AND DEDICATED TIME AND FINANCES OVER THE YEARS IN ORDER TO HELP ME PROGRESS BOTH AS A STUDENT AND AN ATHLETE -- BUT NOW BUT IS OVER IT IS CLEAR THAT EVEN BEING ONE OF THE TOP PLAYERS IN A SPORT WITH PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THOSE INVESTMENT OF TIME AND MONEY WILL PAY OFF. MORE THAN 50% OF DIVISION ONE COLLEGE ATHLETES SUFFER CHRONIC COLLEGE SPORTS INJURIES THAT WILL PLAY THEM FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. THE TRADE OFF FOR PURSUIT OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS ENORMOUS YET WE'RE DEPRIVE BASIC RIGHTS AT THIS MOMENT I HAVE TEAMMATES AND FRIENDS ALL OVER THE WORLD -- I ALL OVER AMERICA WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM SB TWO OH SIX ON BY GAINING THE RIGHT TO SPONSORSHIPS ENDORSEMENTS AND EVEN FUNDRAISING AND I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THAT THIS IS SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR THAT FEMALE ATHLETES WOULD BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM WHERE WE HAVE FEWER PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ON THE OTHER. END AND HAVE A SMALL WINDOW OF TIME WHERE WE ARE PHYSICALLY -- OUT OUR PRIME AND CAN MAKE MONEY IN EVEN SMALL WAYS -- THROUGH ENDORSEMENTS -- MANY ATHLETES OF MANY OF MY PEERS FRIENDS I DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS TO TRAVEL HOME ON SCHOOL BREAKS HAVE PARENTS WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO SEE THEM PLAN CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES DUE TO FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS. AND FEEL PRESSURE TO GO PRO BEFORE FINISHING THEIR EDUCATIONS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. SB TWO OH SIX TO IT'S AN CA COMPETITION LIMITS THAT ARE SO SEVERE THAT COLLEGE ATHLETES CAN'T PROFIT OFF OF THEIR OWN NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS. IT ONLY HURTS PLAYERS LIKE MYSELF WHO LOST THE CHANCE TO MONETIZE SOME OF THE MOST VALUABLE YEARS OF MYLIFE. BUT ALSO HURTS THE AVERAGE COLLEGE ATHLETE WHO IS AN ALLOWED TO THROW CAMP AT THEIR OWN SHOOT OLD JUNIOR HIGH START A SMALL BUSINESS IN THEIR OWN NAME OR EVEN FUND RAISE TO PAY FOR MEDICAL EXPENSES. NO OTHER COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE TREATED THIS WAY MUSICIANS DANCERS ACTORS AND EVEN OTHER ATHLETES THAT ARE NOT A PART OF THE NCAA -- HAVE NO RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR CAPACITIES TO ACCEPT SPONSORSHIPS AND FINANCIAL GUESTS ONLY AND CA ATHLETES ARE PROHIBITED FROM EARNING INCOME FROM THEIR TALENT HARD WORK IN ATHLETICS SUCCESSES. SB TWO OH SIX WOULD HAVE ALLOWED ME TO MONETIZE MY TALENT AND HARD WORK BEFORE I WAS INJURED. CURRENT AND SAY RULES ARE PATENTLY UNFAIR -- THESE THE NCAA IN THEIR MEMBER UNIVERSITIES MAKE MILLIONS OFF OF TV AND CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP DEALS WELL ATHLETES FREE RISK SERIOUS INJURIES A LIFETIME OF EXPENSES AND ARE DENIED COMPENSATION AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR SPONSORSHIP WHILE. MAKING MONEY FOR THESE UNIVERSITIES -- IT IS WORTH MENTIONING THAT ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIPS ARE NOT ENOUGH FOR MANY STUDENT ATHLETES AND ALSO NOT ALL STUDENT ATHLETES ARE ON SCHOLARSHIP -- SO YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE PAYING TO GO TO COLLEGE AND STILL INCURRING THESE EXTRA COSTS -- SOME PEOPLE LOOK PAST THE GRUELING YEARS OF TRAINING HARD WORK IN INJURIES AND ARGUE THAT COLLEGE ATHLETES GET ENOUGH BUT IT IS NEVER ENOUGH TO HELP LESSEN EQUAL PUBLICITY RIGHTS OR BE DENIED THE ECONOMIC AND CIVIL RIGHTS PROTECTIONS AFFORDED DOLLARS OTHER AMERICANS. I ASKED THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE YES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THIS IN SUPPORT YOU HAVE ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS LEFT OF YOUR FOUR MINUTES BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU SO. MAKE IT QUICK PLEASE BUT WAS EXCELLENT TESTIMONY VERY HELPFUL. MY NAME'S ANDY SCHWARTZ THANK YOU -- SENATOR LEYVA AND JUST PLACE YOUR WILK -- AND TO EVERYONE FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY -- MY NAME'S ANDY SCHWARTZ I'M AN ECONOMIST I STUDY HOW COMPETITIVE MARKETS WORK FOR BETTERING SOCIETY AND I AM A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER IN EMERYVILLE CALIFORNIA -- I WANT TO TALK JUST BRIEFLY ABOUT. WHY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT -- IT'S TRUE THAT MOST OF THE ATHLETES IN CALIFORNIA COLLEGES ARE EITHER. OF MINORITIES OR WOMEN BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHETHER YOU ARE POOR OR RICH IF YOU TO NIGER RIGHTS. YOUR TO NIGER RIGHTS AND THE STANDARD SHOULDN'T BE DON'T THESE ATHLETES GET ENOUGH NOW THE STATE OR SHOULD BE WHY ARE THEY GETTING THEIR FULL CIVIL RIGHTS -- COVER COLLEGE ATHLETES EACH OF US BENEFIT FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN FREE ENTERPRISE AND BY DENYING ATHLETES HESE DURING THEIR PEAK FOR MOST OF THEM THEIR PEAK EARNING YEARS. ESSENTIALLY WERE WERE -- SQUASHING ENTREPRENEURIAL CONDUCT AND WE'RE PUSHING PEOPLE IN MANY CASES ON TO FEDERAL OR STATE ASSISTANCE -- SB TO A SIX TWO AND SOME OF THIS DISCRIMINATION -- BY ESSENTIALLY ENDING WHAT IS A A PRICE FIXING CARTEL BY THE NCAA SETTING THE PRICE OF ALL ATHLETES RIGHTS AT ZERO AND SO WHETHER YOU ARE A PERSON WHO BELIEVES IN EQUALITY UNDER THE LAW. OR BELIEVES IN THE THE BENEFITS OF FREE ENTERPRISE I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU AS A SENATOR TO VOTE YES FOR THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE GO THE MICROPHONE NAME ORGANIZATION AND SUPPORT AND CHAIR MAP BROAD FOR THE TEAMSTERS WE DON'T HAVE A LETTER AND THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CAITLYN DEAN WITH POLICY LINK AND THE ALLIANCE FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MARIO GUERRERO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. KEVIN AS IN COALITION CALIFORNIA WILL PROVIDE SERVICE ORGANIZATION THIS BILL IS WAY OVER DEAL WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THANK YOU. MAY WASHINGTON CAL STATE SOONER SO STATION WE SPARTAN CONCEPT. ALEX GOOD FOR UC'S TRANSITION -- WE SUPPORT THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL [inaudible] COME FORWARD. SHE HAS TO MAKE A LITTLE ROOM AT THE TABLE FOR THEM PLEASE GREAT. WELCOME. IF TWO MINUTES EACH BUT WE DID GO OVER A LITTLE BIT ON SUPPORTS ALL LEGAL FOR A LITTLE BIT AS WELL. GREAT THANK YOU. A GOOD MORNING ALEX GRAYS THE ASSOCIATION INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WE REPRESENT OVER EIGHTY INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS IN THE STATE -- I'D LIKE TO START JUST BY -- RECOGNIZING AND THANKING THE SENATOR AND HER STAFF -- FOR TAKING MULTIPLE MEETINGS WITH WITH OUR GROUP AND OTHERS I JUST TO DISCUSS OUR CONCERNS WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE TENOR OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS. SO WE COLLECTIVELY -- HAVE THIRTY ONE INSTITUTIONS THAT COMPETE IN THE NC TWO EIGHT NINE AT THE DIVISIO ONE LEVEL NINE AT THE DIVISION TO LEVEL AND LEVEL. I WANT TO SAY UP FRONT THAT WERE NOT UNIFORMLY OPPOSED TO POLICY REFORMS THAT BENEFITS STUDENT ATHLETES -- BUT LACKING CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE MUST RESPECT THE OPPOSE THIS BILL OUT OF CONCERN -- FOR THE POSITION IT PLACES ARE MEMBER INSTITUTIONS AND I'D LIKE TO SPEND JUST A MOMENT TALKING ABOUT -- DEPOSITION SO FOR PORT AND A TEST WHETHER NOT THEY'VE ACCEPTED FINANCIAL PAYMENTS AND IF THIS BILL WERE TO BECOME LAW -- OUR SCHOOLS WITH AND HAVE ONE OF TO PASS THEY COULD THEY COULD PURSUE. THEY COULD CHOOSE TO SELF REPORT THESE VIOLATIONS AND DEAN OF STUDENT ATHLETES AND ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE UNPAID STUDENT ATHLETES COULD CONTINUE TO COMPETE WITHOUT RISK OF FORFEITED GAMES. THEY COULD ALSO CHOOSE NOT TO REPORT THESE VIOLATIONS IN THE HOPES THAT VIOLATIONS GO UNNOTICED BY THE IN SITU WAY. BUT THAT EXPOSES OUR INSTITUTIONS TO EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES IF AND WHEN DISCOVERED BY THE IN SITU AND IN EITHER INSTANCE. ATHLETIC TEAMS AND POTENTIALLY ENTIRE ATHLETIC DEPARTMENTS COULD VERY LIKELY BE FOUND TO BE IN VIOLATION OF NCAA BYLAWS CITING -- WHAT THEY WOULD REFER TO AS A LACK OF INSTITUTIONAL CONTROL I WHICH TEAM SCHOOLS ARE COMMITTING MAJOR AND REPEATED VIOLATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS HAVE FAILED TO DISPLAY ADEQUATE CONTROL MEASURES? AND EXAMPLES OF THESE TYPES OF PENALTIES AND SEVERITY CAN BE FOUND IN LOOKING AT WHAT HAPPENED TO USC -- IN THE LAST DECADE IN REGARDS THEIR FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL PROGRAMS OUR AMONG OTHER THINGS THEY LOST THIRTY SCHOLARSHIPS. SO THESE PENALTIES CAN INCLUDE VACATED WINS POSTSEASON BANS LOTS OF MEDIA REVENUE WHICH IS REINVESTED TO THE BENEFIT OF ALL STUDENT ATHLETES BROADLY. AS WELL AS REDUCTIONS AS I MENTIONED STUDENT ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIPS WHICH JEOPARDIZES OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE STUDENT ATHLETES DOWN THE ROAD. IN CLOSING I JUST AGAIN WANT TO STRESS OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT OPPOSED REFORMS THAT POTENTIALLY BENEFITS STUDENT ATHLETES THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES OF OF INITIATIVES AFTER THE IN SITU A INTO THE PAC TWELVE OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS THAT THAT OUR INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. HAVE ADDRESS THINGS -- LIKE THE THE GAP AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR SOME STUDENT ATHLETES I BELIEVE IS REFERENCED IN THE ANALYSIS -- BUT AGAIN LACKING OTHER CHANGED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AT THIS TIME WE REMAIN VERY CONCERNED WITH THE IMPACT -- AND POSITION AT THIS PLACES ARE INSTITUTIONS AND AND FOR THOSE REASONS MR SACK WE OPPOSE. THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL POSITION I ENJOY WORKING AS CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY -- WE TO OPPOSE BUT WE ARE ALSO VERY RESPECTFUL AND APPRECIATIVE OF THE TIME THAT THE AUTHOR STAFF HAS PROVIDED US TO EXPRESS OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE BILL ON OUR PROGRAMS OUR CAMPUSES. AT THE CSU WE HAVE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES OF THAT. EXIST ONLY TWENTY TWO OF THEM OFFER ATHLETICS -- NINE OF THEM WERE DIVISION ONE SCHOOLS TWELVE OR DIVISION TO SCHOOLS WE HAVE ONE AND A AYE A SCHOOL WHICH IS MARITIME. AND CHALLENGE DOES NOT OFFER PART -- ATHLETICS AT THIS PART IS PART TIME BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THEIR PROGRAM. WE ARE EQUALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE THE IMPACT OF SB TWO OH SIX WILL HAVE WE KNOW THAT THE ESTIMATE SENATOR IS TRY TO CRAFT A BILL THAT IS INTENDED. TO NOT HARM THE INSTITUTIONS BUT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE NC A AND THE STUDENT ATHLETE ABOUT WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE AND WHAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE INCOMES COMPENSATION -- THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF CHANGES THAT THE NCAA HAS DONE IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND WE HAVE THE COPTER TO BRING OUR CAR AT ONE OF OUR DOCTORS ME WITH THE SENATOR. WE TALKED A LITTLE ABOUT THOSE CHANGES AND FRANKLY I'M NOT HERE. RESIDENT NCAA BUT WHAT I HAVE HEARD FROM FROM OUR CAMPUSES OF THE CHANGES THAT HAPPENED AT THE NCAA HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT. AND MONUMENTAL LAST FIVE YEARS. AND THE THE THE THE BENEFITS ARE ALLOWED TO STUDENT ATHLETES. IT'S CHANGING AND CHANGING OVER TIME AND MAKING POINT BACK TO THE BALKANS LEGATION THAT JUST HAPPENED. THAT IS A CHANGE IN AND WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE STERN ATHLETES AND GOING FORWARD IT'S GOING TO GO ON FOR THE CONDOLEEZZA RICE REPORT THAT JUSTCAME OUT RECENTLY IS GOING TO PROBABLY CHANGE THE WAY WE CAN. PROVIDE -- BUT WE WILL CALL YOU UP TO MANDATE THAT WE WILL HAVE TO GET REPLACEMENT TH	C WILL HAVE TO GIVE. COMPLETION DEGREE FOR POP BASKETBALL PLAYERS SO IF YOU'RE IN THE PROGRAM TWO YEARS AGO TO PLAY IN THE NBA ARE EVERYONE AND PROFESSIONALLY IN YOUR COME BACK STREET. IT'S GOING TO BE A REQUIREMENT -- CAMPUSES THAT THEY HAVE TO ENSURE THEY HAVE A DEGREE IN THE PATH OF THE COME BACK TO THE PROGRAM. THAT -- WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS THAT IS PROBABLY THE FIRST STEP TOWARD ENDS UP PRODUCT? THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION NAME ORGANIZATION. TYLER REGULAR BE AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA -- WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL WE PUT I THINK THE BILL PUTS THE STUDENT ATHLETES AND REALLY -- VULNERABLE AND AWKWARD POSITION THANK YOU. NAME ORGANIZATION AND OPPOSITION PLEASE BRIAN MACKLIN ANY ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. AFFRONT AVAILABLE SUMMER HAVE A STANFORD UNIVERSITY IN IN OPPOSITION. JANET LOPEZ REPRESENTING THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS CENTER DRAWS ON THEN SENATOR PAN -- WELL. I THINK THIS IS A LONG TIME. BUT NEEDED LEGISLATION -- IT'S TOO BAD THAT HAS TO BE THROUGH LEGISLATION BUT BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME. THAT THE COLLEGES SHOULD HAVE MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION OR THE NCAA SO. MY QUESTION IS HOW DOES THIS FIT IN AND HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF HOW THE NCAA. COULD TAKE RETALIATION -- THOSE ARE MY WORDS COULD TAKE RETALIATION AGAINST CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS -- AND DEPRIVE US FROM PARTICIPATING. WHAT WE SAY? ABOUT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE REFORMS HAVE TO COME TO THE NCAA OR FEDERAL LAW. BUT WE NEED THESE CHANGES THE THE WAY OUR COLLEGE ATHLETES HAVE BEEN TREATED IS JUST. IT'S EMBARRASSING. WHEN YOU CONSIDER ALL THE MONEY AND I KNOW THE BIASES AND DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN? ATHLETES IN PARTICULAR. IS VERY EMBARRASSING SO. HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE FACT THAT IS REFORMS REALLY NEED TO HAPPEN AT THAT LEVEL? THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND I WILL -- GIVE YOU A SOME ANSWER AND THEN -- IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE ANTI SWARTS MAY WANT TO ADD TO IT AS HE'S BEEN IN EXPERT WITNESS AT VARIOUS -- LAWSUITS AGAINST THE IN SITU A SO FIRST. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IS CONSIDERED SUCH A BILL. IF THIS WERE THE FIRST TIME WE WERE HAVING A DISCUSSION -- I THINK WOULD BE VERY LEGITIMATE TO SAY HEY LET'S GIVE AND SEE TO A SOME TIME TO REFORM. NOW THAT WE'RE BRINGING ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE LET'S GIVE HIM SOME TIME TO REFORM WELL IF WE LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF NANCY TO A YOU HAD THE BLACK ATHLETES BACK AS LONG AGO AS THE MEXICO OLYMPICS. WERE PROTESTING THE FACT THAT THEY WERE LITERALLY IMPOVERISHED. AND MANY OF THEM. QUIT. THEIR THEIR SCHOOLING AND EVEN QUIT PARTICIPATING AS OLYMPIC ATHLETES BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THEM SO HERE EDWARDS -- IT WELL KNOWN THAT SOCIOLOGIST IN FRONT IT HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS ADDITIONALLY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS ENTERTAINED BILLS HAD BILLS PRESENTED. FOR OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS ON THIS SUBJECT MATTER INCLUDING BY SEVEN SENATOR KEVIN MURRAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE AND AT LEAST TWO OTHER LEGISLATORS. SO THERE BEEN MANY ATTEMPTS NOT ONLY BY CALIFORNIA BUT BY OTHER STATES THAT SENDS A CLEAR MESSAGE TO NC TWO EIGHT AS WELL AS PROMINENT ATHLETES TALKING ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME -- AND THEY HAVE NOT YET CHANGED NOW WHEN I MET WITH OUR FRIENDS FROM THE DIFFERENT COLLEGES WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS THEY'RE ALL LIKE YOU KNOW WILL THE IN SITU A HAS MADE SOME REFORMS AND I'M LIKE YEAH. THEY HAVE MADE SOME BUT LET'S GET HIM TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND I INVITED OUR COLLEGES TO JOIN WITH ME SO THAT CALIFORNIA COULD BE A CATALYST IN A LEADER. IN DEMANDING THE REFORMS BY IN SITU WAY NOW THE BILLS TO BILLS EXPLICITLY PROHIBITS THE AND SEE TO WAY FROM RETALIATING ON CALIFORNIA ATHLETES IN CALIFORNIA COLLEGES. NOW WHETHER THEY DO OR DON'T AND WHETHER IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THIS BILL PASSED THE TAKE IT TO COURT. THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS OF BEING THE CATALYST BUT THE BILL DESIGN NOW. PREVENTS THEM FROM OR PROHIBITS THEM FROM THE RETALIATION. AND I DON'T KNOW FIVE INDY WANTS TO WRITE I JUST WANNA ADD ONE THING REAL QUICKLY ARE ACTUALLY TWO THINGS I WAS HERE IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE BY PUSHING FOR THE STUFF SO I'M SIXTEEN YEARS OLDER NOW WHEN AT WHERE THIS BASICALLY THE SAME SPOT -- EARLIER THIS YEAR THERE WAS A STATE LEGAL CASE DOWN IN LOS ANGELES OVER A DIFFERENT NCAA ROLL CALL THE SHOW BECAUSE RULE WHICH ALLOWS THE NCAA SCHOOLS TO BOOK TO BASICALLY OPPOSE A COLLECTIVE BOYCOTT ON A COACH. IF HE OR SHE IS FOUND TO HAVE VIOLATED THE RULES. THE HEAD OF THE PAC -- TWELVE LARRY SCOTT WHEN TESTIFIED SAID IF YOU IF YOU STRIKE DOWN THIS RULE OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS WILL BE. KICKED OUT OF THE NCAA SO SAME SORT OF THREAT. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN KICKED OUT. THANK YOU SENATE RAZA IS ONE AT THAT I CONSULTED MY EXPERT WHICH IS MY SON MICHAEL -- AND HE VERY MUCH IS ON THE SIDE OF THE COLLEGE ATHLETES. THANK YOU CENTER PAN. I THANK YOU ACTUALLY CAN WE HAVE THE OPPOSITION APPEAR A QUESTION FOR THEM THAT'S ALRIGHT YOU CAN STATE YOU CAN SAY THEY CAN SIT THERE THEY HAVE INTERESTS. THEY'RE STILL TEACHER YET THERE'S ROOM FOR EVERYONE. THERE YOU CAN GO THERE. OKAY CENTER PAN THANK YOU AND AND IT JUST Y. CLARIFY -- YOU KNOW I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THEIR SCHEDULE CLARIFIED THE OPPOSITION IS YOUR OPPOSITION SOLELY BECAUSE YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT AND AND SEE DOUBLE IT WILL DO TO YOU AND THE ATHLETES. ARE DO YOU HAVE ANY FUNDAMENTAL CONCERNS WITH ANY THE POLICY THINGS IN THE BILL SIDE FROM NC DOUBLE A POTENTIALLY SAYING SO. THE IDEA THAT THE THINGS ARE IN THE BILL SUCH AS ALLOWING YOU STUDENT ATHLETES TO BE ABLE -- TO YOU KNOW REPRESENTS BASICALLY REPRESENT THEMSELVES MARKET. OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THINGS THAT I MEAN OTHER STUDENTS CAN DO AND OTHER FIELDS SO I I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT YOUR OPPOSITION IS IT JUST BECAUSE OF NC DOUBLE A OR DO YOU HAVE ANY FUN OTHER FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES WITH. WHAT THE BILL IS REQUESTING? I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING IT IS THE NCAA RULES BUT THERE ARE SOME SOME WORDING IN THE IN THE MEASURE -- RELATED TO WHAT IS NAME LIKE THIS AN IMAGE WHAT WHO WHO CAN PROVIDE THAT OKAY WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS A CUT OFF. OKAY -- THEN THAT'S PROBABLY BETTER AT THE KINDS FROM THE NCAA TO TELL US WHAT I THINK THAT'S AYE ALTHOUGH ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW NOW THAT YOU KNOW THEY'LL BRING IN NC DOUBLE A AGAIN I'M SAYING WHAT IS THE WHAT THE YOU UNIVERSITIES WHAT. THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT SO I SAID LET'S REMOVE NC DOUBLE A I KNOW WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT EVENTUALLY RIGHT. BUT I WANT YOU TO TELL ME -- NC DOUBLE A SAID HAS THIS ROLE I WANT YOU KNOW I ONE KNOWS WEARS YOU SEE WHAT INDEPENDENT COLLEGES WHERE THE LC IT'S ON ON THE FUNDAMENTAL. ISSUES IN THIS BILL THAT THAT'S PUT FORTH ASIDE FROM YES I GOT THE CONCERNED ABOUT I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY WHICH IS THE NC DOUBLE A PART AND WHICH IS THE PART THAT. YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IN THE BILL. THE SOVIET UNION FINALLY SAY JUST JUST AND SEE DELAY BUT DON'T TELL ME NC DOUBLE A RULES ARE MAKING US DO SOMETHING THAT STEP THAT'S A SEPARATE CONVERSATIONS I GOT THAT. SIDES ONE NODE ANY DO YOU HAVE ANY DISAGREEMENT OTHER THING OTHERWISE WHAT THE BILL SAYS. BOB AGAIN THE DEFINITION COMPENSATION WHAT WHAT CORSICA OFF LINE IN THAT. OKAY SO COULD I MEAN I THINK PERHAPS MAYBE THE NEXT THAT THAT THAT MAYBE THAT CAN BE WORKED OUT OKAY ALL RIGHT -- AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE TO LIVE IN THIS UNIVERSE SO THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE. IS -- THE NC A DOUBLE A HAS A GOVERNANCE BODY HER RIGHT. IS BECAUSE OF UNIVERSITIES CORRECT -- HAVE YOUR HAS YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT HAS PRESIDENCY ISSUE HAS PRESIDENT OF UNIVERSITIES WRITTEN LETTERS AND SAID WE WANT YOU TO CHANGE THE RULES. WE WANT TO SUPPORT THESE THINGS BECAUSE WE THINK OUR STUDENTS SHOULD BE EMPOWERED. HAVE YOU LIKE TO TRY TO CHANGE THE RULES AT ALL AND SEE THAT WAY. SENT LETTERS INDICATING THAT WE STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THOSE EXISTING RULES. THIS IS TYLER FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA I WOULD SAY IF IT'S SPECIFIC TO LETTERS BUT I WOULD SAY IN THE GENERAL SPHERE OF THE POLICY CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED. BY THE NC DOUBLE A FOR EXAMPLE WE TALKED ABOUT GETTING SCHOLARSHIPS UP TO FULL COST OF ATTENDANCE AND EVEN INCLUDING. MORE THAN COSTA TENANTS LIKE THINGS -- FOR LAPTOPS WE TALKED ABOUT OTHER EXPENSES THAT THAT GAP BETWEEN COSTA TENSENESS SCHOLARSHIP BUT YEAH I THINK. ABSOLUTELY I CAN SPEAK FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA THAT WE SUPPORT. THAT INCREASE AND WE WANT TO PROVIDE AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO STUDENT ATHLETES WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE FRAMEWORK THAT WE ALL VOLUNTARILY AGREED TO OKAY JOINT. ALL RIGHT SO THE DON'T FORGET I MEAN IT'S IF IT'S A FRAMEWORK YOU DID VOLUNTARILY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME. YOU KNOW FOR BERMAN TO TAILOR NAZARIAN WE WE WE KNOW THAT WE DON'T KNOW WE HAVE EXISTING LAWS WE ALSO CHANGE LOS THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE RIGHT.

CENTER HERTZBERG YOU HAVE BEEN INFINITELY PATIENT WITH US THIS MORNING. PLEASE COME FORWARD. SB TWO SIXTY FIVE BY SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO. TO THE DAY I STOOD AT THIS DíAS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. AND PRESENTED THE CHILD HUNGER PREVENTION AND FAIR TREATMENT ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND RECEIVED. A UNANIMOUS SUPPORT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND EVERY COMMITTEE AT EVERY FLOOR ACTION SINCE THEN. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ON THIS MEASURE AND THE REASON THAT WAS THE CASE MADAM CHAIR. IS BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS THAT JUST SCREAMED OF EQUITY. KIDS WHO GO TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY YOU'RE PAID A BILL ARE GIVEN A DIFFERENT MEAL FOUR OUNCES OF JUICE AND A HALF A SANDWICH. SOME ARE MORE STAMPED IN THEIR HANDS MARK DID NOT TO GIVE ME A MEAL OR SOME PEOPLE THERE SITTING WITH THEIR FRIENDS ALL OF A SUDDEN -- MEAL IS RIPPED OUT IN FRONT OF THEM. A GREGIS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. IN ALL COMMITTEES AND IN BOTH HOUSES BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THIS AND WHAT DID WE LEARN AND WHY AM I BACK I'M A LITTLE EMBARRASSED TO BE BACK HERE TODAY. BECAUSE OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS CHANGE CERTAIN STANDARDS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE CHOSEN TO TRY. TO NIT PICK THE LAW THE FIGURE OUT WAYS TO NOT TAKE CARE OF THESE KIDS NOW I UNDERSTAND OF A PARENT DOESN'T PAY THEIR BILL IT'S ONE THING. BUT YOU DO NOT SHAME A KID IN SCHOOL PERIOD END OF CASE. AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY AND TAKING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENT BECAUSE THE ONE QUESTION ABOUT THIS IT'S FAIRS THIS MAY IN FACT REQUIRE COSTS AND SO WE'LL PUT A SUNSET. AND TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE COSTS ARE FOR DISTRICTS BUT THIS IS A SITUATION WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THIS A FRIEND OF MINE TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE SHOWED ME MEMOS FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO GET AROUND THIS BILL. SO WE'RE BACK. WE'RE BACK IN MORE FILL IN THOSE HOLES AND I REMEMBER WHEN I PRESENTED THIS BILL SENATOR WILL JOIN DON FROM THE DíAS IS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE -- AMONG OTHER REPUBLICANS OR NON DO IT AGAIN. SO WITH THAT -- I'LL HAVE A WITNESSES PRESENT TEN AYE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO YET AGAIN PRESENT ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE. THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG TWO WITNESSES TO MINCE EACH PLEASE. CAN REALLY ROSENBERGER WITH SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION WHERE DOES A POINT TO BE BACK HERE ON THIS ISSUE -- OUR CAFETERIA WORKERS WERE VERY ENGAGE ON THIS IN PART BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT HAVE TO ENFORCE THIS POLICY -- WHAT'S. WHEN WE? FIRST STARTED WORKING ON THIS LIKE A MAYBE A HANDFUL OF SCHOOLS IT'S NOT A HUGE ISSUE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR CAFETERIA WORKERS SHARED A STORY WITH US. OUR WORKERS ARE OFTEN FOOD INTO CARE AND FOR THEM TO HAVE TO ENFORCE THIS ON THE STUDENTS IS DEMORALIZING AND IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO CONTINUE SERVING THE SCHOOLS BUT THEY HAVE TO BECAUSE IT'S THEIR JOB. SO WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU NOT ALLOW LOOPHOLES BUT THEN PUT THE ONUS ON OUR WORKERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JESSICA BARTH Là WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND SPONSOR AND SUPPORT. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD DISAGREE THAT ONE OF MOST DISCUSSING THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN IS THAT A HUNGRY CHILD GOES WITHOUT FOOD -- WHEN THIS ALSO HAPPENS IN A SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT WHEN THERE'S A MEAL ALREADY MADE FOR THEM? THAT'S EVEN MORE DISGUSTING AND WHEN THEY ARE THEN REQUIRED TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL INTO THE CLASSROOM. AND TO PAY ATTENTION. TO BE REPRIMANDED AND DOES THE PLANNED IF THEY DON'T. THIS IS NOT A STATUS QUO THAT ANYBODY IN THE STATE CAN BE PROUD OF LATE WE ALSO ARE DISAPPOINTED BE BACK HERE IN TO SEE -- SOME OF THE SCHOOLS FINDING WAYS AROUND LAST YEAR'S LAW -- AND AND WE KNOW THAT THE ISSUE IS COMPLICATED AND SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE COMMITTEE STAFF TO HELP TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE MOVE THIS FORWARD IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T. BANKRUPT OUR SCHOOLS THE DOESN'T UNDERMINE ECONOMIC SECURITY OF THE WORKERS BUT ALSO DOESN'T LET A KID GO HUNGRY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU GO AHEAD KEVIN AS THE COALITION CALIFORNIA WHAT FOR RIGHTS ORGANIZATION IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I THINK WITH THE DOING THE DOING CHILD ABUSE WHEN THEY DO THIS TO KIDS. AND SHAMEFUL THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND YOU ALL WIN FOR BEING UNDER TIME GOOD JOB. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS PAMELA GIVES REPRESENTING THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED. TURN MEMBERS CUT THE MUSTARD BUT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS IN SUPPORT. MORNING RESIDENTS ALSO ME HALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS IN STRONG SUPPORT. TRACY PATTERSON CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT REALLY GLAD YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES IT'S GREAT. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. CNN IS THEIR OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD MAKE A LITTLE ROOM. THANK YOU WELCOME. GOOD MORNING BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. ELIZABETH ASKED ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS COUNCIL SUPPORTS THE EFFORTS OF THE AUTHOR TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO MALES ARE NOT SHAMED WHEN HAVING UNPAID SCHOOL MEALS. ALL MALE FIGURES HOWEVER WE MUST WE HAVE SOME FISCAL IMPLEMENTATION CONCERNS -- THAT WE'D LIKE TO SHARE. WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH PROVIDING ONLY ONE MEAL OPTION TO ALL STUDENTS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING BECAUSE IT WILL CREATE A FINANCIAL BURDEN ON SO MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WHILE SOME SCHOO DISTRICTS MAY BE ABLE TO USE PARENT TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. DONATIONS TO PAY FOR SCHOOL MIL DEFICITS MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS TAP INTO THE GENERAL FUNDS TO OFFSET THESE COSTS. HI FREE IN REDUCE SCHOOL DISTRICTS COSTS ARE MINIMIZED BY THE COMMUNITY COMMUNITY ELIGIBILITY PROVISION WHICH PROVIDES FREE MEALS TO ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF INCOME STATUS BUT NOT ALL SCHOOL SITES QUALIFY FOR CP. SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS ESTIMATE BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TO A MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO PROVIDE ONLY ONE MEAL OPTION TO ALL STUDENTS. THERE ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE MEAL OPTIONS TO ALL STUDENTS DALY. ANY STUDENT MAY SELECT AN ALTERNATIVE MEAL FOR THEIR MEAL CHOICE HAVING THE SELECTIONS FOR ALL STUDENTS ALLOW. ALLOWS FOR STUDENT WITH INSUFFICIENT FUNDS TO NOT BE DIRECTLY IDENTIFIED WHEN THEY RECEIVE THE CHOICE AS AN ALTERNATIVE MEAL. WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE THE BILL HAS AN EMERGENCY CLAUSE AND WOULD GO INTO EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. THIS WOULD LIMIT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S ABILITY TO PLAN ACCORDINGLY. FOR THE ADDITIONAL COSTS INTO THEIR SCHOOL BUDGET. WE REQUEST THAT SB TWO SIXTY FIVE BE AMENDED TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO COVER THE COSTS FOR UNIVERSAL MEALS IF THERE'S NOT A BUDGET APPROPRIATION TIED. THEN WE REQUEST THE BILL ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE MEAL IF THE ALTERNATIVE MEAL IS AVAILABLE TO ALL STUDENTS DALY. AND WE ALSO ASK FOR A PHASE IN IMPLEMENTATION DATE TO LAW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TIME TO PLAN AND BUDGET ANTICIPATED COSTS AND HAVE ALIGNED WITH THE LOCAL. CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN AND THE BUDGET PROCESS AND FOR THESE REASONS BECAUSE WHAT HOUSING OPPOSE UNLESS I'M IN A POSITION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH AUTHORED A STAFF ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE INTO THE READ ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL NUTRITION ASSOCIATION. CCNA REPRESENTS SCHOOL FOOD SERVICE DIRECTORS -- EMPLOYEES AND INDUSTRY MEMBERS WHO WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE NUTRITIOUS MEALS TO CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN AND TO MAKE SURE NO CHILD IS HUNGRY -- CS IN A IS NEUTRAL ON THE POLICY CHANGES ON THE BILL WE DO HAVE STRONG CONCERNS ABOUT THE COST -- WE APPRECIATE SENATOR AND SPEAKS DESIRE TO ENSURE THAT AN APPROPRIATE PROCESS IN PLACE AND TO ADDRESS -- ENSURE THAT STUDENTS AB WHO THEN PAID NO CHARGES -- ARE TREATED FAIRLY AND NOT SHAMED -- OUR MEMBERS WORK VERY HARD TO PROVIDE -- THE MEALS OUT FOR OUR CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN. THE PREPARE BREAKFAST LUNCH IS AN AFTER SCHOOL SNACKS MANY HAVE SUPPER AND WE CAN BACK PACK PROGRAMS AS WELL THEY DO THE WORK THEY DO. BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE STUDENTS ARE FED AND READY TO LEARN. THEY DON'T DO THE JOB FOR FANFARE BUT BECAUSE THE KILLER CERTAINLY NOT FOR FAME OR FORTUNE BUT BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT CHILDREN. WE WISH THAT WE COULD PROVIDE EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA WITH MEALS FREE OF CHARGE AND WE WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH SENATOR HERTZBERG AND COMMITTEE FOR AN ANNUAL APPROPRIATION TO DO SO -- OUR MEMBERS ALREADY HAVE POLICIES IN PLACE THAT FOCUS ON CONTACTED THE PARENT NOT THE STUDIO. THERE HAVE BEEN -- A NUMBER OF POLICY CHANGES SINCE A. B. SB TWO FIFTY THAT HAVE BEEN GOOD AT CREATING AWARENESS AND WE THINK THAT'S THAT HAS BEEN IMPORTANT. BUT IT'S ALSO HAS INCREASED THE COST DRAMATICALLY. I'M MOST OF THE POLLS HE'S CALL FOR PROVIDING THE SAME MAIL HOWEVER SOME DO PROVIDE AN ALTERNATE MAIL. I WHICH IS ALLOWABLE BASED ON THE INTERPRETATION OF OF SB TWO FIFTY BY THE DEPARTMENT AND OTHERS ARE THE GUYS THAT THAT THE FIELD RECEIVED. INCIDENTALLY AN ALTERNATE MEAL AS MY COLLEAGUE NOTED IS OFTEN CHOSEN BY STUDENTS -- BROTHER THEY PREFER. BUT SADLY UNPAID MEAL CHARGES ARE NOT REIMBURSED BY FEDERAL DOLLARS WE RECEIVED THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM FOR SOME DISTRICTS THAT COST CAN BE ASTRONOMICAL AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS AS YOU'LL SEE BY THE SURVEY DISTRIBUTE THIS WAS A SURVEY. OF OUR MEMBERS OF THEIR COSTS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SB TWO FIFTY AFTER AND CURRENTLY. BUT DEFICIT AT THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR MUST BE COVERED BY A DISTRICTS GENERAL FUND WHICH MEANS THAT OTHER DISTRICT PROGRAMS MAY NOT RECEIVE THE FUNDS THEY NEED. DISTRICTS OF IMPLEMENTED MULTIPLE EFFORTS TO LOWER COST THEY DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO ENROLL STUDENTS IN FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH AND TO INCREASE PROVISION. TO AND C. E. P. PARTICIPATION UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THINGS GOING ON AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL MANY FAMILIES ARE -- WARY OF SIGNING UP AND NOT JUST BASED ON IMMIGRATION STATUS BUT BECAUSE THE FORMS REQUIRED ETHNICITY SOMETHING REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL LAW. OUR FOR OUR FOLKS ACOSTA REDESIGNED AREAS WHERE STUDENTS -- PAY IN HOW THEY PAY. BUT CASTIEL RICE WE'RE CONCERNED BECAUSE OF THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW RELATIVE TO UNPAID DEBT IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE THE COST ISSUE STUDENTS WILL BE AFFECTED BY CUTS TO OTHER GENERAL FUND BASED PROGRAMS. AND MORE SCHOOL DISTRICTS COULD BE PUT IN FISCAL DISTRESS. AND WE AGREE AND UNDERSTAND THE SENATORS AND CAN'T WITH SB. TWO SIXTY FIVE WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS OF HIS STAFF TO WORK WITH US TO ADDRESS THESE THESE COST ISSUES. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HIM IN A STAFF TO DO SO. THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING AND HEARING NONE OPERATE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS CENTER PAN. THANK YOU CENTERS FOR AGAIN -- AND AND I APPRECIATE -- YOUR EFFORTS TO TRY TO SURE THAT FIRST OF ALL CERTAINLY WE SHOULD NOT BE SHAMING STUDENTS -- BUT CAN YOU PERHAPS ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION'S ISSUE ABOUT THE THE THE CUT THE COST AND I THINK AN ANALYSIS WITH THAT I THINK IT DOES POINT OUT THERE'S ACTED RATHER DRAMATIC RISE IN COSTS SO -- CAN YOU PERHAPS SPEAK TO HOW WE SHOULD TRY TO ADDRESS THAT HOW YOU THINK THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AND WITH A KIND OF A YOU KNOW AND AND AND ALSO THE MENTIONED ALTERNATIVE MEALS AVAILABLE TO ALL STUDENTS AGAIN I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT THAT PERMIT. THE STUDENTS TO CHOOSE WHICH MILLER DATE ONLY BE FORCED TO DO THE ALTERNATIVE. MAYBE I SHOULD ASK THE OPPOSITION REAL QUICK TO CLARIFY THEIR AMENDMENT [inaudible] AFTER PROPOSAL. PLEASE PROCEED YES ELIZABETH DESCHANEL CASPER -- YES WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE MEAL OPTIONS TO ALL STUDENTS EVERY DAY FOR THE HOW THE THE MAIL IT BUT WITH THE SENATE INTO UNFORTUNATELY DID NOT HAVE ORDER. PARENTS BEHIND WITH THE HAVE A CHOICE OF EITHER MY OLD IT ONLY HAVE THE ALTERNATE MEAL BOTH. SO THOSE ARE YOU SAYING LEAST ANSWERED ME ALL YOU GOT THAT EVERYONE HAS A CHOICE STILL YES OKAY HOLD ALTERNATIVE MEAL WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO ALL STUDENTS. AND ALSO INCLUDING THE STUDENT WHO'S MAYBE BEHIND PAYMENT COULD STILL PICK UP OKAY EXACTLY IF I WHAT YOUR PROPOSAL IS OKAY THAT BUT THAT IS ONE THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL DOES OKAY. SO I KNOW YOU HAVE TO CLEAR EVERYTHING THE ARK POSITION ARGUES COMPLETELY MISSES THE POINT IT MISSED THE POINT LAST TIME IT MISSES THE POINT WORSE THIS TIME. IT MISSES THE POINT BECAUSE WE HAVE A FEDERAL PROGRAM. THAT PROGRAM STUDENTS CAN SIGN UP FOR AND TO GET THEIR MEALS PAID. FOR IT AND THATS REIMBURSED TO THE DISTRICT OKAY THAT'S PRETTY SIMPLE THIS IS ABOUT THE PARENT AND WE TESTIFIED LAST TIME THAT YOU HAD PARENTS THAT WEREN'T EVEN INFORMED THAT FOR THE THEY WEREN'T EVEN GET A NOTICE. AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS MANAGEMENT WAS SO BAD THAT THEY JUST SIMPLY PUT THE WORKERS IN THE POSITION AND PUT THE STUDENTS IN A POSITION TO RIP OFF THE MEALS OR TO PUT KIM SOMETHING ALTERNATIVE. THE ALTERNATIVE MEAL PROGRAM CAME OUT WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION'S DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE I AM NOT ARGUING WITH THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE MEAL THAT SUPPLIED TO EVERYBODY THIS A LUNCH SHAMING BILL THIS IS A BILL WHERE. YOU NEED TO GET OFF YOUR **** AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO COLLECT THESE BILLS THIS IS AN OFFENSE TO ME THAT THEY'RE OBJECTING TO THE URGENCY BECAUSE ALL WE'RE DOING IN THIS BILL IS SAYING LIVE BY THE LAW. AND DON'T TRY TO PLAY THE LAWYERS GAME TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET AROUND IT THESE NOT WE'RE ASKING FOR THIS A LUNCH SHAMINGBILL. AND THIS IS BASICALLY REQUIRING THESE ADMINISTRATIONS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO COLLECT THE BILL WITH OUT. SHAMING THE KIDS THERE IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM THAT REIMBURSES THEM THE ALTERNATIVE BILL ABILITY FOR OTHER MEALS AS THE BY THE WAY JUST YOU KNOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL JUST BLAST HALF AN HOUR. JUST JOINED A MULTI SUIT LITIGATION AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DEALING WITH FEDERAL NUTRITIONAL STANDARDS WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES BECAUSE THIS IS A FEDERAL PROBLEM DEALING WITH WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO. TO REDUCE THESE KINDS OF BENEFITS TO KIDS BUT THAT'S A SEPARATE A SEPARATE ARGUMENT THE ARGUMENT IS MANAGER DISTRICT IN A WAY THAT DON'T SHAME KIDS END EVERY MORAL LEVEL. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ABOUT AND YES THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME PROBLEMS WERE PARENTS DON'T PICK UP THE TAB YES THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME PROBLEMS WERE MAYBE THAT ABILITY MORE CREATIVE IN COLLECTING THE BILL. AND YES THIS COMMITTEE HAS ADDRESS THAT BY PUTTING A SUNSET ON THIS SO THAT WE CAN THEN DO A DIAGNOSTIC TO MAKE A DETERMINATION GOING FORWARD. BUT TO TO OBJECT TO THIS URGENCY WHEN IN FACT THIS IS THE LAW OF THE LAND IN CALIFORNIA AND THESE FEW DISTRICTS ARE TRYING TO GET AROUND THE LAW SHAME ON THEM. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG.

THE FUNDAMENTAL CAUSES WERE EVIDENT PERVASIVE DISCRIMINATION AND SEGREGATION IN EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION AND HOUSING HAVE EXCLUDED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FROM THE BENEFITS OF ECONOMIC PROGRESS.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN I'M DOCTOR ANTHONY SMILED ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE MERVIN DONNELLY. OUR POLITICAL ECONOMIC INSTITUTE. AND I'D LIKE TO THANK A SENATOR STEVEN BRADFORD FOR HIS SPONSORSHIP OF SP. FOUR TWENTY SIX THE REASON THAT THE MERVYN TIMELY INSTITUTE WANTS TO IMPLEMENT THE TIMELY FELLOWS PROJECT IS TO TRY TO REVERSE THE TREND. A MALE AND ROLL MAN IN UNIVERSITIES IN CALIFORNIA. THE STUDY WAS JUST RELEASED THIS FEBRUARY BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON THE STATUS AND TRENDS IN EDUCATION OF ETHNIC AND RACIAL GROUPS. ARE. THROUGH. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND EVEN THOUGH. HIGH SCHOOL DROP OUT RATE SO MOST WHITES LATINOS AND BLACKS HAVE DECLINED FROM -- TWO THOUSAND TO TWENTY SIXTEEN WHITES FROM A SIX POINT NINE TO FIVE POINT TWO LATINOS FROM. TWENTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT TO FOUR POINT SIX ARE SCREWED ME TO EIGHT POINT SIX AND BLACKS FROM THIRTEEN POINT ONE TO SIX POINT. TWO OUR THERE HAS BEEN TWO POINT THREE MILLION LESS MEN ENROLLED IN COLLEGE THAN WOMEN OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME. IS LARGELY BECAUSE MALES ARE NOT GOING TO COLLEGE THE LOWER SOCIAL ECONOMIC -- DEMOGRAPHY AND SOURCE OF LOS ANGELES IS AN IDEAL SOCIAL LABORATORY TO FOCUS ON THIS POPULATION -- WHERE OF? MEALS ARE DISAPPEARING FROM COLLEGES IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE FEEL THAT IT NEEDS TO BE STUDIED IN REVERSE THE TIMELY INSTITUTE WANTS TO PARTNER WITH HIGH SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- AROUNDIDENTIFYING PARTICULARLY YOUNG MEN WHO WERE NOT ON THE COLLEGE TRACK. DC STUDENTS VERSUS THE A STUDENTS AND TO HELP THEM DEVELOP BOTH LIFE PLANS IN EDUCATIONAL PLANTS THAT WILL HELP THEM TRANSITION INTO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND TO THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. THIS CURRICULUM INCLUDES BROADENING -- THEIR PERSPECTIVE -- INTO A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE BY ENGAGING AND INTERNATIONAL EXCURSIONS AND STUDY ABROAD PROGRAMS WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO DEVELOP THE SAME WORLD VIEW IS MANY OF THE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS THAT THEY COMPETE AGAINST. AND HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHY HIGHER EDUCATION IS IMPORTANT TO THEIR LIFE DEVELOPMENT. AND SO I ASK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF SP FOUR TWENTY SIX THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

OUR FOR THE REASONS CLEARLY STATED I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU SIR CAN SOME OF THE BILL PLEASE. THANK YOU SENATOR PAM AND SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM NINE AS BEFORE TWENTY SIX THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA AYE LEYVA AYE WILK CHIANG LASSELL GLAZER. GLAZER AYE MCGUIRE PAN PAN AYE. THANK YOU WILL LEAVE THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD. SENATOR ROTH. I BELIEVE YOU HAVE THREE BILLS TO PRESENT TODAY. STARTING WITH SB. FOUR SIXTY ONE PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SEE AS YOU WELL KNOW THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM IN THE STATE PROVIDES OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. WITH MUCH NEEDED FINANCIAL AID. HOWEVER OF THE STATUTORY LIMITATION OF FOUR ACADEMIC YEARS OF FULL TIME ATTENDANCE CREATES A LARGE BARRIER. FOR STUDENTS SEEKING TO GRADUATE IN A FOUR YEAR TIME FRAME. SOMETIMES FRANKLY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SIGN UP FOR THE NECESSARY COURSES DURING THE REGULAR ACADEMIC TERM AND SUMMER SCHOOL. BECOMES A NECESSITY NOT AN OPTION. UNFORTUNATELY CAL GRANT DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY DEDICATED FINANCIAL AID FOR SUMMER COURSES. SO THIS BILL WOULD ANSWER THE DEMONSTRATED NEED BY EXPANDING THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM TO ALLOW CAL GRANT A OR B. STUDENTS. TO RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL SUMMER CAL GRANT AWARD FOR UP TO TWO SUMMER TERMS CAPPED AT NIN UNITS FOR PURPOSES OF TIMELY COMPLETION OF A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE. AT U. C. OR C. ISSUE. EXPANDING CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY TO SUMMER SESSIONS WILL ALLOW STUDENTS TO AFFORD SUMMER COURSES REDUCE THEIR FINANCIAL BURDEN. AND GRADUATE IN A FASTER TIME FRAME WITHOUT INCURRING ADDITIONAL DEBT. WE HAVE ENGAGE THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION TO ENSURE pWORKABLE FROM A PROGRAMMATIC STANDPOINT I HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY CHIU COOPER FROM UC SANTA BARBARA AND SHOWED NINO FROM CAL STATE LONG BEACH. CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION REPRESENTATIVE IS ALSO HERE FOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT. CENTER THANK YOU CENTER ROTH WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES -- THE ARMENIAN AS KIM AND I SHARED WITH TO COOK WINEMA FOURTH THERE ARE YOU LIST OF CALIFORNIA BARBER SUIT. THE REASON I'M HERE TODAY IS TO TESTIFY WHY I BELIEVE THAT THIS COMMITTEE SAID PASSABLE. FOR SIX ONE WHICH WAS AUTHORED BY SEN RICHARD ROTH AND WHICH USED EXTEND THE CONTRACT THIS SUMMER. ALASTOR SYLLABLE PASSED TO THIS COMMITTEE AND IT ACTUALLY PASADENA ADAM SUPPORT. NOW THE REASON I BELIEVE A PASTOR THIS COMMITTEE WAS BECAUSE THIS COMMITTEE BELIEVE AND SAW THAT THERE'S SOME PROBLEMS OFTEN THE PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. IT'S A PROBLEM THAT THE MAJORITY OF FOR SOME REASON BLACK AND BROWN PAPA RECIPIENTS AND ROLLED THE UC DID NOT GRADUATE WITH THEM. IT'S A PROBLEM THAT CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO EXPERIENCE A ONE TO ONE MILLION COLLEGE GRADUATION GIFTS ABOUT THE YEAR. TWENTY THIRTY FOR THE WHAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT WE KEEP ON SAYING THAT OUR INSTITUTIONS OF FOR INSTITUTIONS WHEN THE ACTUAL REALITY SUCCESS TO GRADUATION. NOW I HAVE TO WORK AT THE USES BEACON AT TRADE OFFICE AND TO THE REASON IS THAT OF THE POP AND WE DID A CALCULATION. WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT IT WAS TO RECEIVE THE FULL POWER GRANT AS WELL AS THE INSTITUTIONAL GRANT IT'S STILL NOT COULD BE ENOUGH TO COVER THE TUITION CAP SPECIES WITH SOME COURSES? AT THIS BUT WE HAVEN'T START COUNTING THE COST OF HOUSING THE COST OF FOOD TO THE COST OF TEXTBOOKS. SO I HAVE TO SIT THERE AND TELL THE STUDENTS HAVE TO SAY LOOK I'M SORRY -- THAT YOUR CLASS THAT YOU NEEDED TO GET INTIMATE WAS OVER AND ROLLED OR I'M SORRY THAT'S HAD A FAMILY EMERGENCY AND I TAKE A LEAVE OF ABSENCE I'M SORRY THAT YOU SWITCH TO MAJOR. LIKE THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA BUT YOU CAN HAVE TO TAKE ON MORE DEBT. YOU NEVER MISS OUT ON FUTURE EARNINGS BECAUSE YOU CAN AFFORD TO GRADUATE ON TIME YOU CAN FOR SOME COURSES. NOW THERE ARE THAT I'M THE ONE WHO HAS TO TELL STUDENTS THIS BECAUSE THE LAST TWO YEARS AGO I WAS ACTUALLY THAT STUDENT. AND IT'S BETTER TO GET MY FULL PROGRESS BY ME TO GET MY FORCE TO SNOW GRANT. I STILL HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK. I STILL AT TWO FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK AND I STILL HAD TO GET TO SEE SOME SCHOOLS GOSSIPS TO SO THAT I COULD AFFORD EIGHT UNITS OF SOME COURSES. DOUBLE AS I AM HEARING WITH STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA HERE AND THE REASON WE'RE HERE IS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THIS COMMITTEE CAN HELP US GET ONE STEP CLOSER TO FIX THESE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS INHERENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION. THAT'S WHY WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. AS YOU DID LAST YEAR LET YOU COLLEAGUES GLASSER BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT MUCH LIKE THEN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THAT WE NEED TO FIX FINANCIAL AID. THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU WELL SAID NEXT WITNESS. HELLO EVERYBODY MY NAME IS JONI NO ON THE CHAIR FOR THE COUNTIES STUDENTS ASSOCIATION -- KERN STUDENT ACTUALLY GRADUATE STUDENT AT CALIFORNIA STAE UNIVERSITY LONG BEACH -- BUT ALSO A JUST FINISH GRADUATING -- WITH I'M ALUM FROM FROM CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY LONG BEACH AND DEFINITELY A FINANCIALLY RECIPIENT CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS. BUT I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CONCERT SOON SO STATION AND REPRESENTING NEARLY HALF A MILLION STUDENTS -- FIRST I'D LIKE TO THINK THE YOU SEE SENATOR ROTH AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA STUDENT ASSOCIATION -- FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS BILL -- YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR BUT SEASON SAY HAS BEEN REALLY INTERESTED IN PAIN COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL AID REFORM. AND SOME OF THAT IS SOME SOME OF THIS ACTUALLY FITS DIRECTLY IN LINE WITH THAT. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE WE'RE FOCUSED ON IS ADDRESSING SOME OF THE ISSUES WITH THE OVERALL COST OF ATTENDANCE -- MORE IT GETTING RID OF ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE UNNECESSARY AND RESTRICTIVE AN EXCLUSIVE. WE'RE ALSO INTERESTED IN. DEFINITELY INCREASING MORE ACCESS FOR STUDENTS LOW INCOME STUDENTS HAVE A SUMMER CAL GRANT -- FIRST MANY STUDENTS AND SOON LIKE MYSELF -- I'M IT TRANSFORMATION EIGHTY COLLEGE -- YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A TWO YEAR PLAN I WANT TO TRANSFER AND LOTS OF TIMES IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT MORE BEYOND THOSE TWO YEARS.

AS A SOME OF YOU KNOW BACK IN NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OF THE SENATE HELD AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. SELECT COMMITTEE THAT -- I AM PRIVILEGED TO CHAIR AND AT THAT HEARING WE HEARD FROM MANY STAKEHOLDERS ON THE NEED FOR POLICY CHANGES AND INCREASED SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO IMPROVE THE OUTCOME. FOR PARTICIPATING MINOR AN ADULT STUDENTS ENROLLED IN CT WE WERE ALSO MADE AWARE THAT 30% OF WORKERS IN THE UNITED STATES WILL NEED TO CHANGE JOBS OR UPGRADE THEIR SKILLS SIGNIFICANTLY BY. TWENTY THIRTY AND 65% OF PRIMARY SCHOOL STUDENTS TODAY WILL HOLD JOBS IN THE FUTURE THAT SIMPLY DO NOT EXIST TODAY. ACCORDING TO RESEARCHERS CALIFORNIA WILL BE SHORT ABOUT ONE MILLION EMPLOYEES WITH BACHELOR'S DEGREE IS AND PERHAPS MORE OF MORE SIGNIFICANCE TO THIS PROGRAM. ROUGHLY ONE THIRD OF NEW JOBS CREATED IN THE STATE WILL REQUIRE SOME TRAINING BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL. BUT LESS THAN A FOUR YEAR DEGREE. SO TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR C. T. PROGRAMS ARE AGILE THAT THEIR COLLABORATIVE THAT THEY ARE INCLUSIVE AND THAT THEY ARE. EFFECTIVE. WITH REGARD TO THIS BILL SENATE BILL FIVE FIVE FOUR I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES TECHNICAL AMENDMENT. DESCRIBED ON PAGE FIVE OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. IN SUMMER THE BILL INTENDS ON PROVIDING AN ADULT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT WITH THE SAME BENEFIT AFFORDED TO MINOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO WISH TO TOOL AND ROLE IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. RESEARCH BOTH NATIONALLY AND IN CALIFORNIA'S DOCUMENTED THAT DUAL ENROLLMENT IS A POWERFUL STRATEGY FOR INCREASING COLLEGE SUCCESS. AND AFFORDABILITY FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS WE ALSO KNOW THAT OVER OF COLOR. WITH LATINOS MAKING UP 64%. WHEN IT COMES TO ATTENDING A POST SECONDARY EDUCATION PROGRAMS SUCH AS AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE PROGRAM OR A BACHELOR'S DEGREE PROGRAM? ONLY 2% OF THESE ADULTS STUDENTS TAKE PART. WE NEED TO DO BETTER. THIS BILL PROVIDES A STREAMLINED APPROACH FOR HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY STUDENTS TO CAN CURRENTLY IN ROLE IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE BY SIMPLIFYING THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS AND IN SOME CASES WAVING TUITION. AND FEES I HAVE WITH ME TODAY -- MATT MARIN DIRECTOR OF ADULT EDUCATION HIGH SCHOOL PARTNERSHIPS THE CHAFEE COLLEGE AND BRIANNA BRUHNS DIRECTOR OF POLICY AND ADVOCACY WITH THE CALIFORNIA EDGE. COALITION. THANK YOU CENTER ROTH WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BRIANNA FRIENDS AND THEN THE DOCTOR POLICY NOT BECAUSE HE FOR THE CALIFORNIA I'D COALITION. THE IT'S COALITION IS A NONPARTISAN COALITION OF BUSINESS LABOR EDUCATION WORK FORCE AND SOCIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS AND WITH A PROUD SPONSOR IS I'VE SB. FIVE FIVE FOUR AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED RESEARCH SHOWS THAT DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS INCREASE ACCESS TO POST EX POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND TRAINING. THESE PROGRAMS IMPROVE SUCCESS FOR ALL STUDENTS PARTICULARLY YOUNG MEN OF COLOR LOW INCOME AND FIRST GENERATIONS STUDENTS. ONE EXAMPLE OUR INSTITUTION GP COLLEGE OPERATED AN INTERNAL DUAL ENROLLMENT PILOT PROGRAM OFFERING ADULT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ENROLLED IN HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY COURSES THE OPPORTUNITY TO DUEL AND TRULY INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE COURSES. THE SUCCESSES SEEN WITHIN THIS PILOT ENCOURAGE AT THAT ADDS TO WORK WITH SENATOR ROTH TO EXTEND TO ENROLLMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO ADULT SCHOOL STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. HERE TO SPEAK TO THE SUCCESS OF THAT PROGRAM ITS POTENTIAL IS DOCTOR MATTHEW MORE IN OF TV COLLEGE AND I'LL YIELD THE REST OF MY TIME TO HIM. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK OU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK THIS MORNING MY NAME IS MATTHEW MARIN AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF DISTANCE EDUCATION ADULT EDUCATION HIGH SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP SUCH A FEW COLLEGE. THANK YOU -- SENATOR LEYVA FOR YOUR WORK IN OUR DISTRICT TO SUPPORT HIGHER EDUCATION. ORIGINAL SCAN CONDUCTED BY TV COLLEGE AND THE ADULT SCHOOLS OF THE WEST AND ADULT EDUCATION CONSORTIUM FOUND THAT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ONLY TWO HUNDRED AND NINE OUT OF THE SEVENTEEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND THREE ADULTS SCHOOL ENROLLEES IN THE CHAFEE COLLEGE SERVICE STEP. DISTRICT ENROLLED IN A CHIEF YOU COLLEGE CREDIT COURSE. OF THESE MOST FOR ESL ENROLLEES. SO THE NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY AND HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA STUDENTS WERE FAR BELOW THIS PAINTED A DARK PICTURE OF COLLEGE TRANSITION FOR THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO REMAIN IN POVERTY. WITHOUT IN ATTEMPTING TO IMPROVE ON THIS CRISIS OF TRANSITION CHAFEE COLLEGE AND THE ADULT SCHOOLS IN ITS SERVICE DISTRICT EMBARKED ON A RADICAL STRATEGY. WE COLOCATED CREDIT BEARING C. T. E. AND COLLEGE TRANSITION COURSES ADULT SCHOOL CAMPUSES. AFTER ONE SEMESTER VERY LOW ENROLLMENT AMONG HSE AND HSE STUDENTS THE ADULT SCHOOL STAFF EXPRESSED THAT MANY WERE NOT ENROLLING BECAUSE THEY WERE INTIMIDATED BY THE COMPLEXITY OF MATRICULATION. ASSESSMENT AND THE PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION REQUIRED TO OBTAIN FINANCIAL AID SUCH AS INCOME VERIFICATION AND CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS INFORMATION. IN CALIFORNIA SPECIAL PART TIME ADMIT DUAL ENROLLMENT IS A TOOL THAT COLLEGES USED TO ENROLL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TUITION FREE. WITHOUT REQUIRING FINANCIAL AID APPLICATIONS INCOME VERIFICATION RESIDENCY INFORMATION AND A TV COLLEGE ASSESSMENT. EAGER TO OVERCOME THE BARRIERS OF THE PREVIOUS SEMESTERS ENROLLMENT CHALLENGES IN SPRING TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CHAFEE COLLEGE CREATED A STRUCTURE DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAM FOR THE ADULT HSE AND HSE STUDENTS. USING THE SPECIAL PART TIME ADMIN ENROLLMENT PROCESS. THE PROGRAM SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE ENROLLMENT FROM THESE POPULATIONS WAS ADORED BY THE ADULT SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND RECEIVE TREMENDOUS INTEREST FROM OTHER COLLEGES AND ADULTS SCHOOLS. THE SPECIAL ADMIT PROCESS ENCOURAGED A STRONG PARTNERSHIP OF SHARED CULTURE IN PROGRAM OWNERSHIP BETWEEN THE COLLEGE AND THE ADULT SCHOOL. BY GIVING ADULT SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS OR THEIR DESIGNEES LOCAL CONTROL OVER ENROLLMENT IN THE PROGRAM THROUGH THE REQUIREMENT OF THEIR SIGNATURE. ADDITIONALLY STUDENTS WERE NOT REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE INVASIVE FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION PROCESS A KEY BARRIER DISCOURAGING STUDENTS FROM ENROLLING. THE COLLEGE AND THE ADULT SCHOOL ADVERTISE THE CLASSES FREE HELD AN APPLICATION WORKSHOP IN ORIENTATION AND WE ENROLL THE STUDENTS THE FOCUS WAS SUPPORT AS OPPOSED TO INK IDENTITY VERIFICATION. AFTER THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE NOTIFY TV COLLEGE THAT A SPECIAL ADMIT STATUS ONLY APPLIED TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ENROLLED IN HIGH SCHOOLS. AS OPPOSED TO ADULT SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA STUDENTS. WE DISCONTENT WE JUST CONTINUE TO SPECIAL ADMIT ADULT SCHOOL PROGRAM. THE COLLEGE HAS NOW HALTED ITS CREDIT BEARING TO ONE ROMAN ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM DUE TO THESE BARRIERS. SB FIVE FIFTY FOUR WILL MAKE A PATHWAY POSSIBLE TO RESTART THIS IMPORTANT WORK AT CHAFEE AND OTHER COLLEGES IT WILL ALSO PLACE CALIFORNIA AS THE LEADER IN PROVIDING AN EQUITABLE EXPANSION OF DUAL ENROLLMENT.

I BELIEVE THAT THE COMMITTEE STAFF IS DISTRIBUTED TO YOU. TO BE CLEAR I WILL SPEAKING TO THE SPEAKING TO THE CONTENTS OF THE BILL AS AMENDED PER THE STAFF'S RECOMMENDATIONS. THIS BILL SEEKS TO ENHANCE THE EXISTING COLLEGE AND CAREER ACCESS PATHWAYS PROGRAM WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED BY AB TWO EIGHT EIGHT SOME REMEMBER HOLDEN IN. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE CAP IS A SIX YEAR DUAL ENROLLMENT PILOT PROGRAM DESIGNED TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS BY BRINGING COLLEGE COURSES. TO HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES VIA PATHWAY AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCES OFFICE IS REQUIRED TO PREPARE AND AN EVALUATION OF THIS CAP PROGRAM BY JANUARY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE INCLUDING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT. BASED ON FEEDBACK ALREADY PROVIDED BY CAP PARTICIPANTS IT IS CLEAR THAT THE PROGRAM HAS YET TO UNLOCK. ITS FULL POTENTIAL THE NUMBER OF CAP PARTICIPANTS IS FEWER THAN ANTICIPATED AND THE AVAILABILITY OF STUDENT FOCUS SERVICES. SPECIFICALLY ADMISSIONS ASSISTANCE ACADEMIC COUNSELING AN OUT REACH IS LACKING. THIS BILL SIX TO ONE ENSURE THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE EVALUATION IS AS HELPFUL AS POSSIBLE TO EXISTING AND PROSPECTIVE CAP PARTICIPANTS. AND TWO DEMONSTRATES THE VALUE THAT EFFECTIVE AND FULLY FUNDED CAP AGREEMENTS BRING. TO COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. THE BILL ESSENTIALLY HAS THREE COMPONENTS THE FIRST COMPONENT WOULD EXTEND THE CAP PROGRAM FOR AN ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS UNTIL JANUARY. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY SEVEN THE SECOND COMPONENT WOULD ENHANCE THE CURRENT CAP SUMMARY REPORT ROOF WHICH IS REQUIRED FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. BY INCLUDING SEVEN NEW ARAMETERS FOR PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT AMONG THOSE SEVEN ARE WAYS TO REDUCE PAPER BASED REGISTRATIONS IMPROVING THE TRACKING AND MONITORING OF STUDENT PARTICIPANTS. THREE DEMONSTRATING BEST PRACTICES FOR SUCCESSFUL CAP PARTNERSHIPS STATEWIDE. THE THIRD COMPONENT WOULD ESTABLISH A CAP COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM THE GRANTS WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND AWARDED TO THREE CAP PARTNERSHIPS IN THE STATE ONE IN THE NORTH ONE IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE STATE AND ONE IN. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO BE DETERMINED DETERMINED. THAT DEMONSTRATE THE PROPER MIX OF SUPPORT SERVICES FOR ACADEMIC SUCCESS STUDENT PARTICIPATION SUSTAINABILITY AND EDUCATOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT.

SENATE ROTH PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FOR FOR HAVING ME HERE THANK YOU -- CENTER TO LABOR FOR CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU CENTER OFF AND STAFF FOR HELPING WORK ON THIS. A SINNER OFF MITCHELL MY NAME'S BOB BRYAN RESTOCKED RECENT PRESIDENT OF NORCO COLLEGE -- A COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE -- AND WE'RE SO PLEASED TO BE WORKING ON THIS BILL -- AS YOU ALL KNOW THE STATE LEGISLATURES BEEN WORKING ON BILLS FOR A FOR A LONG HISTORY TO HELP STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO COLLEGE EDUCATION WHILE THEIR ROE IN HIGH SCHOOL AND SB. FIVE SIXTY THREE IS ONE OF THE BUILDING BLOCKS IT ADDS TO THAT -- THAT LONG HISTORY -- IT HELPS REMOVE SOME BUREAUCRATIC HURDLES THAT WE FOUND IN THE PROCESS AND IT'S GOING TO HELP -- ADD SOME WRAPAROUND SERVICES WE REALLY NEED TO FIGURE OUT THE THE THIS IDEA OF WRAPAROUND SERVICES -- FOR THESE -- THESE PROGRAMS -- WE'VE BEEN -- WORKING ON THESE SERVICES FOR QUITE AWHILE AND THE REALLY ESSENTIAL AT IF YOU IF YOU WERE TO THINK UP TRYING TO PUT A HIGH SCHOOL IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE TOGETHER THEY DON'T YOUR SINK RIGHT UP -- HIGH SCHOOLS HAVE THEIR OWN KIND OF BUREAUCRATIC SYSTEMS WEIGH EVEN ROLLING STUDENTS SUPPORTING STUDENTS COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE THEIRS AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO PUT THE TWO TOGETHER. AND SO IN ORDER TO PUT THEM TOGETHER YOU NEED TO PROVIDE SOME WRAPAROUND SERVICES -- IN THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO AND ONCE YOU DO THAT A SUCCESS RATES REALLY START TO INCREASE LET ME GIVE YOU. A QUICK EXAMPLE OF THIS. IN THE EARLY ARE TO THOUSANDS WE STARTED OFFERING COLLEGE COURSES TO JFK HIGH SCHOOL TO SMALL HIGH SCHOOL. IN -- IN NORCO. AND BY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE HAD ONE STUDENT GRADUATE. ARE. THEY WOULD THEY WALKED ACROSS THE STAGE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY GOT THERE A A DEGREE SO WHILE THEY WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL THEY FINISHED THE ASSOCIATES DEGREE. IN TWO THOUSAND NINE WE HAD ZERO STUDENTS DO THAT. TWO THOUSAND TEN WE HAD TO STUDENTS WALK ACROSS THE STAGE GET THEIR A A DEGREE AT THE SAME TIME. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN ONE STUDENT TWO THOUSAND TWELVE ZERO STUDENTS TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOR STUDENTS TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ONE STUDENT. TWO THOUSAND FIVE FIFTEEN WE HAD FIVE STUDENTS AND THAT'S THE YEAR WE GOT A GRANT. AND ADDED WRAPAROUND SERVICES INTO THIS PROCESS. BY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ITS STATE AT FIVE STUDENTS. BUT BY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE WRAPAROUND STE -- SERVICES STARTED TO KICK IN AND EIGHTEEN STUDENTS WALKED ACROSS THE STAGE HAVING RECEIVED THEIR A A DEGREE WHILE THEY WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL. LAST YEAR I WAS AT THE GRADUATION TWENTY SEVEN STUDENTS WALKED ACROSS THE STAGE GETTING AN A A DEGREE. AND I SPOKE WITH THE PRINCIPAL THIS MORNING WE'RE ON TRACK TO HAVING THIRTY STUDENTS THIS YEAR WALK ACROSS THE STAGE AND THAT'S A SMALL HIGH SCHOOL THERE'S ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE GRADUATE SO LAST YEAR. 15% OF THE STUDENTS WALKED ACROSS THE STAGE FROM THAT HIGH SCHOOL WITH AN A A DEGREE. AND FORTY EIGHT ALMOST HALF OF THE STUDENTS FINISH THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR WHILE THEY WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL. NOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE COST SAVINGS TO THOSE FAMILIES AND WE'RE WHEN WE'RE WORKING IN A LOW SCS COMMUNITY. IF ALL THE STUDENTS WOULD FINISH HER EIGHT AGREE AND THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR WHILE THEY WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL. HAD DECIDED INSTEAD TO DO THOUGH -- DO THEIR STUDIES AT THE CSU IT WOULD COST THEM THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY THEY SAVED THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. IF ALL OF TEM HAD DID STATE GOING TO SPELL UC'S IT WOULD COST HIM FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO DO THE WORK THAT THEY DID WHILE THEY WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL IN THIS IS FREE EDUCATION NOW WE'VE EXPANDED THAT PROGRAM TO ELEVEN HIGH SCHOOLS. OKAY AND OUT WE HAVE ELEVEN PEOPLE WORKING ON THAT WHO ARE ALL IN GRANTS WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT AS A SYSTEM HOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE. HOW WE'RE GONNA WHAT KIND OF WRAP AROUND SERVICES WE NEED TO PROVIDE IN THE I THINK THIS BILL REALLY WILL HELP US DO THAT THANK YOU? EXCELLENT GREAT STATISTICS OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. EIGHTY ONE ON THE COMMITTEE YES SENATOR PAN -- SO APPRECIATE THOUGH FOR YOU TEND TO AND BRING FOR THE BILL I UNDERSTAND THAT -- WHEN THE QUESTIONS RAISED AN ANALYSIS WAS THE ISSUE ABOUT WELL KNOWN THE EVALUATION ISN'T TAKING PLACE THE LETTER I GOT THE ALSO THE POINT THAT HEY WE KNOW THINGS THAT WERE?

THANK YOU SB. FOUR SIXTY SEVEN PLEASE PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AS THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND FOOD IN SECURITY CONTINUES TO RISE. THE CSU AND YOU SEE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS WITH ACCURATE ESTIMATES FOR THE COST OF ATTENDING THEIR SCHOOLS. AND THE METHODOLOGY THEY USED TO DETERMINE THOSE ESTIMATES. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED ASSEMBLY BILL NINE NINETY AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ WHICH NOW REQUIRES THE C. ISSUE AND YOU SEE THE POST ON THEIR INTERNET WEBSITES. HE ESTIMATED MARKET COST OF AN OFF CAMPUS ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT WELL THIS IS A GOOD FIRST STEP. PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS COULD BENEFIT MORE FROM COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION ON THE EXPENSES THEY WILL FACE WHEN THE IN RURAL. SB FOUR SIXTY SEVEN REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND REQUEST THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. TO PLACE ON THEIR WEBSITES THE CONFERENCE OF COST OF ATTENDANCE INCLUDING THE CURRENT COST OF AN ON OFF CAMPUS TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT IN A SINGLE BEDROOM IN A PRIVATE HOME FOR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS. THIS BILL EMPOWERS PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS TO MAKE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS FROM REVIEWING A PERSPECTIVE SEE ISSUE OR YOU SEEN. MEMBERS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME LAST YEAR I VOTE -- I'D LIKE. TO INVITE OUR WITNESSES TO TESTIFY THROUGH THE CHAIR IS ARE YOU THE CHAIR CURRENTLY YES THANK YOU -- WE HAVE PAGE LOGAN WHO'S A STUDENT AT CAL POLY A SAN LUIS OBISPO AND JAKE ONE CAN SALSA STUDENT AT CAL POLY THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER MINING -- WITNESSES SUPPORT THAT WE ASK THAT YOU TRY BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU WITHIN FOUR MINUTES THANK YOU. THE GREEN BUT THERE YOU GO. HELLO AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND CHAIRMAN AND HONORABLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS PAIGE LOGAN AND I'M A FIFTY YEAR POLITICAL SCIENCE MAJOR I CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF SB. FOUR SIXTY SEVEN I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK SENATOR MONNING FOR AUTHORING INTRODUCING OUR BILL. I'M A FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENT THAT'S MY FAMILY AN I WERE NEVER AWARE OF THE TRUE EXPENSES THAT CAME ALONG WITH THE COLLEGE ATTENDANCE. THE STIGMA BEHIND COLLEGE LOAN DEBT DISSUADED MY FAMILY AND I FOR TAKING OUT SUBSTANTIAL LOANS TO COVER THE COST OF ATTENDANCE ASIDE FROM MY TUITION. WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR ME TO MOVE OFF TO COLLEGE I HAD TO TAKE ON MORE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MYSELF? MY SINGLE MOTHER AND I HAD TO COVER THE EXPENSES OF TO LIVING UNITS WHICH IS GOING TO BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. I WAS PRETTY MUCH FORCED TO FIND A JOB AND WORK AS MUCH AS I COULD WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING MY SCHOOL WORK. I PERSONALLY HAVE TO WORK ABOUT THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY HOURS A WEEK TO SUPPORT MYSELF FINANCIALLY THROUGH COLLEGE. HAVING TO WORK IN ORDER TO EARN A CERTAIN INCOME EACH MONTH LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF UNITS I CAN TAKE EACH QUARTER. HAVING TO FOCUS ON MY FINANCIAL NEEDS HAS RESULTED IN FIND FALLING BEHIND IN MY DEGREE PROGRESS AND UNLIKE -- AND LIKE MANY OTHER COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE OUT CALIFORNIA I'M GRADUATING AS A FIFTH YEAR. FURTHERMORE I DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REACH MY FULLEST POTENTIAL DURING MY UNDERGRADUATE YEARS. UNLIKE MY FELLOW CLASSMATES I CAN AFFORD TO EVEN CONSIDER APPLYING FOR THOSE UNPAID INTERNSHIPS. OR EVEN WITHOUT THOSE AMAZING STUDY ABROAD SEMESTERS. I DEFINITELY STRUGGLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET THESE PAST FIVE YEARS I'VE BEEN UNWILLINGLY STUCK IN MY CURRENT LIVING SITUATION BECAUSE IT'S THE CHEAPEST RUN OPTION I'VE FOUND FOR MY BUDGET. I KNOW I'M NOT THE ONLY STUDENTS SUFFERING WITH THE SIMILAR STRUGGLES. THROUGH MY EXPERIENCES IN CONVERSATIONS WITH MY PEERS ABOUT THESE ISSUES WE HAVE GATHERED AND ORGANIZED AS A CLASS TO CONSTRUCT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND ATTEMPT TO BRING MORE TRANSPARENCY TO THE ESTIMATED COST OF ATTENDANCE PROJECTED BY CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES. HOW CAN CALL JUNE STILL COVERED ENOUGH IN THEMSELVES AND THEIR FUTURES IF THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH THE FINANCIAL BURDENS ON A MONTH TO MONTH BASIS? FINDING PLACES TO RENT BECOMES MORE COMPETITIVE AND EXPENSIVE EACH YEAR I BELIEVE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE ACTION FOR MAKING THE COST OF ATTENDANCE MORE TRANSPARENT. MORE TRANSPARENT COST PROJECTIONS WILL OUR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS TO NAVIGATE THE COST ESTIMATES AND FIND THEIR BESTED PERSONAL NEEDS. I KILEY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT OF SB. FOUR SIXTY SEVEN THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN ARNOLD COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR PROVIDING US WITH THE OPTION TO SPEAK TODAY. I'D LIKE TO START BY EXPRESSING OUR GRATITUDE TOWARDS -- CENTER MONNING AND HIS STAFF FOR THEIR EFFORTS AND WILLINGNESS TO TAKE ON THIS BILL. MY NAME IS TAKE WALKEN'S I AM A FOURTH YEAR POLITICAL SCIENCE MAJOR CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO HERE STRONG SUPPORT AS BEFORE. SIXTY SEVEN AS BEFORE SIXTY SEVEN BUILT UPON PART OF LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED ISSUE AT HAND THROUGH ONE EXPANDING ON AB NINE NINETY TO INCLUDE THE COST OF A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT. AND ONE PERSON BEDROOM IN PRIVATE HOMES ALONG SO THE COST OF A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT IMPOSING THESE COSTS ON RESPECTIVE INSTITUTIONS FINANCIAL AID WEBSITES THAT PROVIDE CATEGORIZE COST OF LIVING ESTIMATES. TO SEPARATE BECAUSE OF COST ESTIMATES OF OTHER BECAUSE LIVING CATEGORIES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE ESTIMATED. BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING LIVING AT HOME OR CURRENT RESIDENTS THE COST OF FOOD BECAUSE THE TRANSPORTATION BOOKS AND SUPPLIES. MISPLACE EXPENSES TUITION MENTORS IN FEES AND THREE INCLUDING A STATEMENT THE STRESS OF THE PRESS -- PROSPECT OF STUDENTS THAT THE COST WAS THAT ARE MERELY ESTIMATES AND THAT THEY ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONDUCT RESEARCH TO ASSESS THEMSELVES AND BETTER OUTLINING THE COST. THAT WILL SATISFY THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. FOR TRANSPARENCY SICK THE BILL WULD ASK THE INSTITUTIONS INCLUDE A DESCRIPTION AS THE HOW THE DATA PRESENTED WAS DERIVED. THROUGH DESCRIBING THE METHODOLOGY INCLUDING THEIR SOURCES UNIVERSITIES ARE HELD TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY WILL ALSO GIVING STUDENTS A SPRINGBOARD AND BEGINNING TO DERIVE THEIR OWN INDIVIDUALIZED COST OF ATTENDANCE ESTIMATES. URGING STUDENTS TO DO THEIR OWN RESEARCH ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE SEEKING OUT COST ESTIMATES ON THEIR OWN CASE BY CASE BASIS. PLACING A LEVEL SHARE RESPONSIBILITY AND UNIVERSITIES AND STUDENTS. DOES THIS LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY ACCESSIBILITY INCONSISTENCY WITH THE STUDENTS IN PLANNING THEIR FINANCIAL PACKAGES WHEN DETERMINING WHICH UNIVERSITIES BEST FIT FOR THEIR FINANCIAL LIMITATIONS. WITH MORE ACCURATE PLANNING STUDENT SUPPORTERS WOULD BE ABLE TO MINIMIZE THE BURDENS THAT COME WITH TRYING TO MAKE THE PROCESS MEN'S GIVEN CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES.

THANK YOU AT YOUR LEYVA AT FIRST TO SAY THE AUTHOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA IT'S THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT THING TO DO. TO PROVIDE THIS TYPE OF DISCLOSURE FULLY SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I ALSO WANT TO I THINK STUDENTS WHO TRAVELED SO FAR FROM IS A CELL AND ELSEWHERE TO BE HERE TODAY IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART. OF US MAKING GOOD CHOICES IS TO HAVE THE INVOLVEMENT OF ALL OF ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES INCLUDING OUR STUDENT COMMUNITY I THINK IT'S VERY HELPFUL THAT YOU HAVE COME HERE AND AND SHARED YOUR EXPERIENCES. I KNOW YOU HAVE WITH THE AUTHOR. I I HAD ONE OTHER OBSERVATION AND AND IT CAME OUT OF A JUST A MOMENT AGO I WAS IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE. GOVERNMENT FINANCING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STUDENT HOUSING AND THE BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THAT THAT WE HAVE WITH THE HOMELESSNESS GROWING AND ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES. THE AFFORDABILITY ISSUE NOT JUST STATEWIDE BUT CERTAINLY -- IT WITH OUR STUDENTS AND OUR CAMPUS IS -- AND A NUMBER OF THE SENATORS -- AND THE PANEL. I TALKED ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT ISSUE AND THAT PART OF THAT DISCUSSION WAS THAT. IN SO MANY CASES OUR OUR CAMPUSES ARE ALMOST LIKE ISLANDS AND WHEN WE ENACT POLICIES AROUND THE STATE DEALING WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS. WE DON'T THINK ABOUT THE STUDENT COMMUNITY AND WITHIN THIS TO CAMPUS COMMITTEE THEY DON'T THINK ABOUT -- OTHER STATE ACTIVITIES AND HOW THEY CAN BETTER LINCOLN CAN ACT AND AND AND TAKE ADVANTAGE AND I'LL GIVE YOU THREE EXAMPLES -- CERTAINLY IN THE AREA OF FOOD -- BASIC NEEDS HUNGER. WE DON'T DO IT ON MENTAL HEALTH LIKE WE SHOULD. PROBLEMS OF MENTAL HEALTH IN OUR COMMUNITY CERTAINLY EXISTED OUR CAMPUSES WHERE WE WORKING BETTER TOGETHER. AND THE ISSUE OF HOUSING IS CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW I TOP EXAMPLE AS WELL WE ARE TRYING TO WE KNOW WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE WE ARE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO DEAL WITH IT INCLUDING SUBSIDIES -- FOR HAVE A HOUSING THAT'S THAT ALLOWS THAT THAT DEALS WITH THE HOMELESS POPULATION AND OTHERS BUT YET WE DON'T BRING THE CAMPUS COMMUNITY IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS -- AND SO IT'S MORE THAN JUST DISCLOSURE WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE IT'S ALSO MAKING SURE THAT OUR CAMPUS COMMUNITIES CAN TAP INTO. OUR STATE RESPONSE TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO HOMELESSNESS -- THAT THAT WE SHOULD BE TOGETHER AND WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S A PART OF OUR CONVERSATION SO THAT'S JUST AN OBSERVATION AS I APPLAUD YOU AND YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER. ANYTHING ELSE ALL RIGHT. EDU MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER. YOUR MONEY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AND JUST BRIEFLY I APPRECIATE SENATOR GLAZERS COMMENTS AND I THINK. ONE OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF THIS EFFORT IS TO SHOW STUDENTS STEPPING UP IN BEING ENGAGED IN I JUST WANT TO APPLAUD THE STUDENTS FROM. NOT JUST CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO THEY'RE THE THEY'RE THE MOTIVE FORCE BEHIND THIS BUT THEN THE COLLABORATION WITH STUDENTS FROM OTHER CAMPUSES. AND WE DO FACE TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES OF OF HOUSING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OF HUNGER. WARNING OF STUDENTS LIVING IN CARS AND THEN TRYING TO DECIDE WHERE TO PARK AT NIGHT SO THAT THEY CAN BE SAFE -- WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT AND I WOULD JUST CLOSE FINALLY ON SAYING. I THINK IT'S IN OUR UNIVERSITIES WHERE WE HAVE THE BRAIN TRUST IN THE INVESTMENT -- TO JOIN US AND SOLVING SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS SO -- AS I HEARD YOUR AYE VOTE I ALSO ENCOURAGE HER STUDENT LEADERS TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THIS ON MANY OTHER ISSUES AS WELL THANK YOU.

WONDERFUL LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO SIMPLIFY THE TRANSFER PROCESS FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO THE UC IN THE C. ISSUE. THEY DO WILL CONTINUE TO REMAIN COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT. FOR SOME STUDENTS TO RESEARCH HAS FOUND A FEW SYSTEMATIC PROBLEMS WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EIGHTY TEAS SUCH AS LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEGREE. BY THE STUDENTS AND CHALLENGES FOR UNIVERSITIES TO CERTIFY WHETHER OR NOT THE TRANSFER STUDENT ACTUALLY HAS THE AT T.. S. B. A FOR WOULD REQUIRE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO IDENTIFY AT T.

GOOD TO KNOW SENATOR PAN. SENATOR JACKSON YOU HAVE SB FOUR NINETY THREE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU AND AND I HOPE I AM IN THE RIGHT COMMITTEE. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SB FOUR NINETY THREE TWO TODAY. THIS IS LEGISLATION THE CODIFIES FUNDAMENTAL TENANTS AND REQUIREMENTS. OF FEDERAL TITLE NINE STANDARDS INTO CALIFORNIA LAW. TITLE NINE HAS BEEN A AN ENORMOUS BENEFIT TO ASSURING A EQUALITY AND EQUITY IN EDUCATION. BUT SADLY IN SOMEWHAT SHOCKINGLY SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND VIOLENCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION IS PERVASIVE. ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY SIXTEEN CAMPUS CLIMATE SURVEY VALIDATION STUDY OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. AN ESTIMATED 62% OF WOMEN AND SAY THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED SEXUAL HARASSMENT ONE IN FIVE WOMEN. AND ONE IN FOURTEEN MEN. EXPERIENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT WHILE IN COLLEGE. HOWEVER DUE TO THE UNDER REPORTING OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE THE RATES ARE LIKELY. MUCH HIGHER. THE PREMISE OF TITLE NINE IS A LACK OF EQUITY MEANS TO SPREAD AND UNEQUAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. AND HOSTILITY CATION -- ENVIRONMENT FURTHER DENIES EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY. THE PASSAGE OF SB NINE SIXTY SEVEN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHICH ESTABLISHED AN AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT STANDARD THE FIRST APPLICATION OF THE YES MEANS YES CONCEPT. IN THE COUNTRY CALIFORNIA TOOK STEPS TO AID COLLEGE AGE MEN AND WOMEN IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND VIOLENCE ON CAMPUS [inaudible] HOWEVER. WE CANNOT BE SATISFIED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT MEASURE INSTEAD WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE NATION IN EDUCATING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE BOTH WOMEN AND MEN. ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF RESPECT AND MAINTAINING HEALTHY PEER AND DATING RELATIONSHIPS. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED REGULATIONS TO TITLE NINE WHICH HAVE NOT YET TAKEN EFFECT. AIM TO CHANGE THE WAY SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO RESPOND TO REPORTS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT IN WAYS THAT ACTUALLY MAKE IT HARDER. FOR SURVIVORS TO REPORT AND THREATEN STUDENTS TO ACCESS TO EDUCATION AFTER THEY DO REPORT. SB FOUR NINETY THREE ADDRESSES COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT IN CALIFORNIA LAW. BY PUTTING IN PLACE GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES FOR SCHOOLS TO USE IN RESPONDING TO ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT INCLUDING NOTICE. AND POSTING REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE STUDENTS ARE AWARE OF THEIR RIGHT. THEIR OPTIONS AND THE PROCEDURES THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED AS WELL AS TRANSPARENCY IN THOSE PROCEDURES FOR INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS IN ORDER TO ENSURE A FAIR AND EQUITABLE PROCESS FOR BOTH PARTIES. AND AS A RECOVERING LAWYER AND AS THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND I AM A STRONG ADVOCATE. IN DUE PROCESS IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND SO THIS BILL REQUIRES COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO PUBLISH THE CONTACT INFORMATION FOR INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS. AND INSTITUTING CORRECTIVE MEASURES THE RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR PREVENTION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AS WELL AS GRIEVANCE PROCESS A GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES PROVIDING FOR THE PROMPT AND EQUITABLE RESOLUTION SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT COMPLAINTS. THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO EMPLOYEES ENGAGED IN THE GRIEVANCE PROCESS. ON TRAUMA INFORMED BEST PRACTICES -- FOR INVESTIGATING SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR ASSAULT COMPLAINTS. AS WELL AS TRAINING IN IMPLICIT BIAS AND THE HISTORY HISTORY OF INSTITUTIONAL RACISM AND RACIAL INEQUITIES IN SCHOOL DISCIPLINARY PROCESS SEES WHAT WE SEE OUT IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN TERMS OF DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES WE ALSO SADLY. SEEN COLLEGES AND THOSE NEED TO BE CORRECTED AS WELL NOW. THERE IS SOME OPPOSITION TO THIS A GROUP OF MOMS WHO WILL. TELL YOU THAT THIS BILL IS FLAWED THAT IT DOESN'T REFLECT THE FINDINGS OF GOVERNOR BROWN'S TASK FORCE THAT USED IN CORRECT STANDARDS FOR FINDING OF FAULT. AND THAT THE TRAUMA INFORMED TRAINING REQUIRED BY THE BILL PREJUDICES THE PROCESS AGAINST RESPONDENTS. THESE CLAIMS ARE JUST SIMPLY NOT CORRECT. NOTHING IN THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE REPORT IS CONTRARY TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF OUR BILL. USE OF THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE STANDARD IS FULLY APPROPRIATE FOR A STUDENT DISCIPLINARY HEARING. AND OP OPPONENTS ARE TRYING TO CONFLATE CRIMINAL PROCESS. AND THE STANDARD OF PROOF WE REQUIRE IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS WITH ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS. THE USE OF TRAUMA INFORMED TRAINING DOES NOT BIASED THE PROCESS AGAINST ANYONE WHAT IT DOES. IS IT INSURES THAT A SURVIVOR IS NOT HARMED OR RE TRAUMATIZED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS THAT THE BILL SETS OUT. AND WITH ME THIS ONE MORNING OUR REPRESENTATIVES VEHICLE RIGHT ADVOCATES THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL. AND G. JERRY A FORMER STUDENT WHO IS HERE TO SHARE HER STORY WITH US. WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS MA HI ABRAHAM AND I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES A CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT. WE PRACTICE UNDER TITLE NINE RELATED CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS TO PROTECT WOMEN AND GIRLS AND WE'VE BEEN DOING SO SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR JUST TWO YEARS AFTER TITLE NINE WAS ENACTED. STUDENTS EDUCATION CIVIL RIGHTS WERE ESTABLISHED TO INSURE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO EDUCATION. THE SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE PUSH OUT OF WOMEN AND GIRLS STUDENTS OF COLOR LGBT Q. I STUDENTS STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. THAT IS EDUCATION CIVIL RIGHTS WERE CREATED AND ARE IN PLACE TO PROTECT STUDENTS WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN DENIED EQUAL ACCESS TO INSTITUTIONS. COVETED BY THE ELITE AND POWERFUL THE PRIVILEGED AND ENTITLED. THESE ARE THE SAME STUDENTS THAT AS EXISTING VOLUMINOUS AND SOUND DATA AMPLY SHOWS STILL FACE THREATS TO THEIR PHYSICAL SAFETY AND ABILITY TO RECEIVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO AN EDUCATION. THE CIVIL RIGHTS ARE UNDER ATTACK AS THE SENATOR NOTED. OF THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IS TURNING CIVIL RIGHTS ON ITS HEAD TO WORK AGAINST THE VERY PEOPLE THAT THESE PRINCIPLES IN THESE RIGHTS ARE MEANT TO PROTECT. AUGUST TOWARD ACCESS AND EQUITY FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE SUFFERED SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT IS THERE FOR IN JEOPARDY. AS BEFORE NINETY THREE IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE CRITICAL GUIDANCE FOR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES SO THAT THEY CAN RESPOND APPROPRIATELY TO ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND VIOLENCE. AND ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS ARE AFFORDED COMMONSENSE. AND FACT SUPPORTED EDUCATION RIGHTS IN THE STUDENT MISCONDUCT INVESTIGATION PROCESS TO THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD TOWARD EQUITABLE ACCESS. EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES OPERATES A NATIONAL HELPLINE THROUGH THAT HELPLINE WE HEAR FROM COUNTLESS STUDENTS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE AFTER THEYHAVE REPORTED SEXUAL ASSAULT TO THEIR SCHOOLS. WE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING MISS GINA G. JERRY -- THIS HOTLINE. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT YOUR WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR EIGHTY YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB FOUR NINETY THREE AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE THE REST OF MY TIME TO MR JERRY. HELLO GOOD MORNING -- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU -- AND MY SUPPORT FOR US BEFORE. NINETY THREE I KNOW FIRST HAND WHY THIS BILL IS NEEDED I WAS RAPED IN COLLEGE I KNOW ALL TOO WELL THE HARM THAT OCCURS WHEN A SCHOOL FAILS TO PROPERLY RESPOND APPROPRIATELY. MY NAME IS GINA COULD JERRY I GRADUATED FROM CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO WITH A DEGREE IN AEROSPACE ENGINEERING IN JUNE. TWENTY EIGHTEEN DURING MY FINAL YEAR I WAS RAPED BY MY SENIOR PROJECT GROUP MADE WHILE WE WERE ON OUR DESIGN REVIEW TRIP TO EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE. I REPORTED MY APE TO THE PROFESSOR THE WEEK AFTER IT HAPPENED AND I HAD TO FACE MY RAPIST EVERY SINGLE DAY IN CLASS. MY PROFESSOR REPORTED IT TO CAMPUS POLICE AND THE TITLE NINE OFFICE. I TO STAY IN TOWN FOR WINTER BREAK AND ASK SHOULD ANXIOUSLY WORK WITH THE PROFESSORS IN SCHOOL TO GET MY RAPIST AT LEAST MOVED OUT OF MY CLASS. BEFORE THE QUARTER STARTED. DURING THE AN INVESTIGATION IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THE TITLE MY OFFICE DIRECTLY. THEY OFTEN DIDN'T ANSWER THE PHONE AND OFFICE WAS FREQUENTLY CLOSED AND LOCKED UNKNOWN WHATEVER ANSWER THE DOOR. SOME OF THE PHONE NUMBERS ARE POSTED ON THE WEBSITE DIDN'T EVEN WORK OTHERS WENT STRAIGHT TO VOICEMAIL AND ANY OCCASIONS THAT THE TITLE NINE OFFICE DID SPEAK WITH ME. THEY WERE HOSTILE I'LL OFTEN CONDESCENDING AND WHEN I ASKED FOR TIME LINES. I WAS REPRIMANDED WHEN I RE ASK QUESTIONS OR DIDN'T REMEMBER INFORMATION. AFTER SIXTY WORKING DAYS NOT INCLUDING WEEKENDS OR HOLIDAYS OR DAYS OFF THE TITLE NINE OFFICE EXTENDED THE INVESTIGATION TIME LINE WITH AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY WORKING DAYS CITING CASE OVERLOAD AS THEN ABOUT A DAY BEFORE THE DETERMINATION WAS SUPPOSED TO BE RELEASED I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER THIRTY DAY EXTENSION BECAUSE OF NEW EVIDENCE BEING CITED. THE NEW EVIDENCE WAS THAT THEY FINALLY INTERVIEW THE PROFESSOR WHO REPORTED IT -- SIX MONTHS LATER. AND I WAS SURPRISED THAT THEY HAD INTERVIEWED HIM UNTIL ONE DAY BEFORE THE INVESTIGATION WAS SUPPOSED TO CLOSE AND THE NEW DEADLINE WAS SET FOR ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE SUPPOSED TO GRADUATE. I DIFFICULTY IN SCHOOL BECAUSE OF THE TRAUMA OF THE ASSAULT ITSELF BUT BECAUSE THE SCHOOL'S RESPONSE SCHOOL DID NOT TAKE THE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE TO ENCOUNTER MY RAPIST IN ORDER TO CONTINUE MY EDUCATION. IN FACT THEY PUT ME INTO THE SAME CLASSES HIM AN ACADEMIC QUARTER AFTER THE RATE. ACCIDENTALLY I GUESS THE SCHOOL TOLD ME THAT I COULD TRY TO COME UP WITH A PLAN FOR MY WHEN MY RAPIST SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO COME ONTO CAMPUS BUT THEY SAID I WOULD HAVE TO DRAFT UP THE SCHEDULE. AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO ALLOW HIM TO BE ABLE TO GO TO ALL THE SAME CLASSES THAT I HAVETO TAKE FOR OUR DEGREE. COMPLETION. I THOUGHT IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE SCHOOL ASKED OUT OF ME AND I DECLINED TO TAKE ON THAT RESPONSIBILITY. I SAW HIM ALL OVER CAMPUS NOT JUST IN THE PLACES WE HAD AEROSPACE ENGINEERING CLASSES BUT ALSO AT THE GROCERY STORE AND OTHER PLACES. AND IT WOULD IMMEDIATELY GIVE ME AN OVERWHELMING SENSE OF PANIC ANXIETY FEAR AND SO MUCH SO THAT I HAD TO MISS MULTIPLE CLASSES ACTS FOR EXCEPTIONS. ETCETERA. I'D BEEN LIED STUDENT ON MY SCHOOLS FORMULA AS THE TEAM WHICH WAS DESIGNING TESTING AND BUILDING A WORKING RACE CAR. I'D BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THIS ACTIVITY FOR FOUR YEARS HOWEVER I HAD TO STEP DOWN FROM THIS POSITION SO THAT I CAN FOCUS ON GETTING THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE ACTUALLY GRADUATING AFTER FIVE YEARS AT CAL POLY. I ALWAYS CONCERNS ON SEVERAL OCCASION ABOUT THE SCHOOLS TITLE NINE PROCESS AND EVEN WALKED INTO THE OFFICE OF THE PROVOST OF THE SCHOOL BUT THEY ALSO SUGGESTED I PROVIDE WRITTEN FEEDBACK ON THE SCHOOLS PROCESS FOR THEM TO CONSIDER AT SOME UNKNOWN FUTURE DATE. OR TOLD ME I WOULD HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE CASE WAS CLOSED EVEN TALK ABOUT IT WITH THEM. THE TITLE -- NINE INVESTIGATOR EVENTUALLY CONCLUDED THAT MY CLASSMATE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RATE. HOWEVER I STILL HAD TO SEE HIM FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR-DURING THE APPEALS PERIOD SO EVEN THOUGH HE WAS RESPONSIBLE. HE WAS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE ATTENDING CLASSES AND FINISH OUT THE QUARTER. A MONTH AFTER I GRADUATED AND THE FRIDAY BEFORE I WAS GOING TO START MY FULL TIME JOB AS A PRODUCTION ENGINEER AT A COMMERCIAL SOLID COMPANY. I WAS NOTIFIED THAT MY RAPIST WHO IS STILL STUDENT HAD APPEALED THE TITLE NINE DETERMINATION AND THAT THE CSU TITLE NINE OFFICE HAD OVERTURNED THE FINDING. FROM THE INVESTIGATION AND NOW FROM MY RAPIST WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. THEY INDICATED THAT BECAUSE I HAD CRIED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INCIDENT AND CALLED MY BOYFRIEND AFTER THE ASSAULT THAT THIS INDICATED I WAS AWARE OF CONSEQUENCES AND FELT GUILTY ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED. THE CSU OFFICE DID NOT CONTACT ME OR AS FAR AS I KNOW ANY OTHER WITNESSES BEFORE OR OVERTURNING THIS FINDING. I WAS TOLD I HAD TEN DAYS TO RESPOND WITH THE APPEAL OF THE NEW OUTCOME. I CALLED THE TUNNEL NINE OFFICE ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS TRYING TO GET MORE INFORMATION WAS UNABLE TO GET A TIMELY RESPONSE. WHEN I DID GET A RESPONSE THEY SAID? THAT THEY WERE SUPERSEDED BY THE CSU TITLE NOT OFFICE AND THEY COULD NOT GIVE ADVICE ON WHAT TO DO BE ON SUGGESTING I RIGHT NOW I FEEL. WHEN THE CSU OFFICE FINALLY CALLED ME BACK CHOOSE VERY STERN AND CONDESCENDING WITH ME OVER THE PHONE AND TOLD ME THAT IT APPEARED I DID NOT KNOW WHAT COERCION AND? SHE ALSO SUGGESTED I CHANNEL MY ANGER AND ENERGY INTO WRITING MY APPEAL. I FINALLY LEARNED OF THE INITIAL DETERMINATION WAS OVERTURNED BECAUSE THE CSU TITLE NINE OFFICE DETERMINED THAT ALTHOUGH I WAS. NOTABLY INTOXICATED I WAS NOT INCAPACITATED ON THE NIGHT NIGHT OF THE INCIDENT. AT LEAST FOUR WITNESSES CONFIRMED THAT THEY WERE WORRIED FOR MY HEALTH AND SAFETY THE NIGHT OF THE INCIDENT DUE TO MY LEVEL OF INTOXICATION. THE CSU TITLE NINE OFFICE REJECTED MY APPEAL. THEY SAID THAT THE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE THAT ARE PROVIDED AND THE WITNESSES I CITED COULD NOT BE INTRODUCED AT THE APPEAL STAGE AND THAT IT WAS NO LONGER RELEVANT TO MY CASE AND WAS NOT CONSIDERED. IF I DIDN'T HAVE SUCH A STRONG SUPPORT NETWORK THAT I DO. I PROBABLY WOULD'VE TAKEN ANOTHER YEAR TO GRADUATE OR DROPPED OUT OR PROBABLY EVEN KILLED MYSELF. I'D SO MUCH FEAR GOING TO CLASSES THAT I BECAME A HOMEBODY I STILL DON'T EVEN GO OUT TO THE GROCERY STORE IT SAFELY DELIVERED TO MY HOUSE BECAUSE I CAN'T GO ON PUBLIC. I'VE TO PRETEND EVERY SINGLE DAY OF MY THE MOST IMPORTANT YEAR OF COLLEGE THAT THIS WASN'T AFFECTING ME THAT SEEING HIM IT DIDN'T EMOTIONALLY HURT ME. AND MAKE ME FEAR FOR MYSELF. THE SCHOOL DID VERY LITTLE TO ENSURE MY SAFETY MY MENTAL HEALTH OR MY ACADEMIC SUCCESS. THE TITLE NINE OFFICER WOULD CALL ME IN THE MIDDLE CLASS ASKING ME TO DESCRIBE VERY SPECIFIC DETAILS ON MY RIGHT ON THE SPOT IN ORDER TO GO BACK TO CLASS AND ACT LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED -- I STILL GO TO THERAPY EVERY SINGLE WEEK TO ADDRESS THE EMOTIONAL TRAUMA NOT ONLY FROM THE RAPE OF FROM MY SCHOOLS PROCESS. AND RESPONSE I STILL HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING AT NIGHT. AND WHAT ALL THIS WAS HAPPENING I TO TELL MY BOSS ABOUT IT BECAUSE I HAD TO TAKE SICK LEAVE TO BE ABLE TO WRITE MY APPEAL. AND CALL THE TITLE NINE OFFICE -- BUT MY EXPERIENCE HIGHLIGHTS ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT MANY COLLEGE STUDENTS FACE. THIS SYSTEM IS SO HORRIBLY BROKEN AND HAS A LONG LASTING IMPACT ON ALL SURVIVORS AND I'M CONCERNED THAT THIS COMPLETE LACK OF UNDERSTANDING AROUND RAPE AND CONSENT -- BUT I'M FEARFUL THAT OTHER CASES THAT ARMED IS. WHAT I THOUGHT OBVIOUS IS MINE WILL BE MISHANDLED AND MISUSE? SO THAT'S WHY I'M USING WHAT PRIVILEGE I HAVE AND I'M THANKFUL THAT IT HAPPENED TO ME IS SO I CAN SPEAK FOR FOR YOU GUYS BECAUSE LIKE WHAT IF MY REGIS WAS VIOLENT. I SAW HIM EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR MY SENIOR CLASS RIGHT AS I LEFT CLASS HE WOULD WALK IN. AND EVERYONE KNEW WHAT HAPPENED IS IS ON THE SENIOR PROJECT DESIGN REVIEW TRIPS SO FORTY TWO PEOPLE WERE THERE. BUT THEY SAW HIM EVERY DAY SO. YOU KNOW THEY DON'T THINK IT ACTUALLY MATTERED OR HE DIDN'T GET ANY REPERCUSSIONS -- SO WITH THAT I'D JUST LIKE TO CLOSE BECAUSE I SUPPORT SB FOUR NINE THREE WHAT IT INCLUDES THE TRAUMA INFORMED TRAINING. IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT EVER REQUIRE THAT COLLEGES HAVE A CLEAR PROCESS IN PLACE FOR RESPONDING TO SEXUAL ASSAULT. IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE A MUCH NEEDED TRAINING ON HOW TO ACTUALLY HANDLE INVESTIGATIONS. TO ENSURE A FAIR PROCESS FOR ALL STUDENTS IN A TIMELY MANNER. FOR THESE REASONS I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY.

I'M A MOM JUSTICE CENTER JACKSON -- STATED NOT ONLY REPRESENTING MY SON WHO WAS WRONGFULLY ACCUSED OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AND ULTIMATELY. KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL. BUT I'M REALLY HERE ALSO BECAUSE HIS TIME IS PAST THAT WAS BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN NOTHING I CAN DO FOR HIM NOW. BUT ALSO I AM REPRESENTING THE OTHER SEVENTY YOUNG OVER SEVENTY YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR FAMILY SUPPORT GROUP WHO ATTENDED A COLLEGE -- A CALIFORNIA COLLEGE WRONGFULLY ACCUSED AND SUSPENDED OR EXPELLED WITH THEIR LIVES CHANGED FOREVER. WE OPPOSE US BEFORE NINE THREE WHICH SEEMS TO BE A DO OVER TO SOME EXTENT OF SB. ONE SIX NINE WHICH WAS ALSO OF COURSE AUTHORIZED BY SENATOR JACKSON AND ULTIMATELY VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN. AND DURING THAT VETO PROCESS -- HE HE PUT TOGETHER AN EXPERT PANEL OF FOLKS TO DIG INTO THIS ISSUES QUICK GOV MORE TO SEE WHAT THINGS. ARE THE RIGHT THING TO DO THEY CAME UP WITH A FORMAL LETTER WHICH ALL OF YOU HAVE IN YOUR OFFICES. THAT WE SENT OVER OVER THE PAST WEEK. THAT TALKED ABOUT TWENTY DIFFERENT ITEMS TO DIG INTO A DRESS AND AS FAR AS WE CAN SEE I'LL SEE IN OPPOSITION TO WHAT SENATOR JACKSON JUST SAID WE'RE NOT SEEING MUCH. OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS PUT INTO SB -- FOUR NINE THREE I CAN ALSO SAY THAT WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS CONCEPT IN THE MOST RECENT SCALE THAT WAS UP HERE TALKING WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION OF INVESTIGATING FIRST OF ALL IT SOUNDS LIKE WHATEVER CAL POLY WAS IT. THEY DID A HORRIBLE JOB HORRIBLE JOB I CAN TELL YOU I'VE BEEN AND I'VE BEEN A A MENTOR OR SOMEONE IN SUPPORT OF SOME OF THESE YOUNG MEN THAT HAVE HAD TO GO UP IN FRONT OF THESE HEARING PANELS PRETTY SCARY. FOR THEM A LOT SCARIER THAN THIS AND SALES A STATE. THEY'RE DOING IT RIGHT I WAS THERE AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND WE WALKED AWAY AND I SAID I'M SORRY. THEY DID IT RIGHT WHAT THE RIGHT WAY. THAT GIRL WAS RAILROADED. AND THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE WE'RE HERE BECAUSE OF THE WRONGFULLY ACCUSED STUDENTS AND A LACK OF DUE PROCESS THAT CONTINUES TO BE IN PLACE. IT WAS IN PLACE AND WOULD BE PERPETUATED IN SB ONE SIX NINE IT WOULD BE PERPETUATED HERE AND SB. FOUR NINE THREE WE URGE EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE. TO CHALLENGE SENATOR JACKSON TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND PUT SOME REAL. OF A TAKE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE VARIOUS GROUPS THIS EXPERT PANEL AS WELL AS OTHER GROUPS. AND WORK ON A BETTER BILL IT CAN BE DONE WE WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH HER ON THIS. I KNOW THAT MOST OF THE CENTERS ON THIS PANEL YOU'VE GOT KIDS. WITH THEIR COLLEGE AGE THERE SENATOR WILK YOU'VE GOT AN ADULT OF SUN TO ADULT WE IDEA APPEARS YOUR DAUGHTER AND YOUR SON -- AND HOPEFULLY THEY WERE ON SKATES DOES THEY WENT TO THEIR COLLEGE CAREERS IN BEING -- ACCUSE OF SOME SORT OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT I CAN TELL YOU FOR OUR KIDS THAT WENT THROUGH THIS SUICIDE SUICIDE IDEATION. SUICIDE ATTEMPTS PTSD. I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT. THE FOLKS I KNOW I KNOW. pMENTION THAT I'M ALSO REPRESENTING. THEY ALSO HAD THE SAME SCARS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN HAVING TO DEAL WITH. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT POTENTIALLY MOVING THIS BILL ALONG I WANT YOU TO THINK OF A FEW THINGS. FIRST SINCE TWO OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN EARLY TWENTY SEVENTEEN ONE CENTER JACKSON FIRST INTRODUCED SB ONE SIX NINE SINCE THEN. THERE HAVE BEEN AT LEAST FIVE CALIFORNIA COURTS OF APPEAL AND NUMEROUS CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT COURTS. HAVE FOUND BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS SEXUAL MISCONDUCT DISCIPLINARY PROCESS FATALLY FLAWED. BUT THEY CREATE AN UNACCEPTABLE UNACCEPTABLE RISK OF BIAS STRAY SO FAR FROM THE PRINCIPLES THAT UNDERLIE OUR DEMOCRACY AND HAVE COMPLETELY OBLITERATED DUE PROCESS THIS IS SINCE THIS SB ONE SIX NINE WAS BORN. THIS IS IN CALIFORNIA ALSO. CALIFORNIA AFRICAN AMERICAN MOTHER. OF AN INNOCENT TRAUMATIZED SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD WHO ATTEMPTED SUICIDE ONCE TOLD US THIS FAMILY SUPPORT GROUP THAT I BELONG. TO FOR US IT'S JUST MORE OF THE SAME AND EXPERTS AGREE CAMPUS SEXUAL MISCONDUCT POLICIES DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT MINORITIES UNDERSERVED IN FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS. I'M NOT SEEING ANYTHING SUBSTANTIAL IN SB -- ONE SIX SKEWS ME FOUR NINE THREE TO CHANGE THAT IT WAS IN ONE SIX NINE EITHER. SO NO MATTER YOUR PARTY AFFILIATION PLEASE PLEASE UNDERSTAND WE WANT YOU TO SAY NO TO THIS BILL. ASK SENATOR JACKSON TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. FISH AND WORK WITH THOSE THAT HAVE BETTER IDEAS WORK WITH THOSE THAT WORKED WITH THIS TASK FORCE AND LET'S MAKE A BETTER BILL WE WOULD LIKE THAT THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE. I LIKE TO BEGIN WAS SENT -- I THINK WE ALL CAN AGREE THAT -- ONE INSTANCE ARE ONE EXAMPLE. OF SEXUAL ASSAULT ON ACCOUNT WHICH CAMPUS IS ONE TOO MANY. I WILL SHARE MY EXPERIENCE WITH YOU GUYS. SIX YEARS AGO TO THE DATE. I WAS FALSELY ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. SO THIS WOULD HAPPEN OF THOSE FALSELY ACCUSED I WAS EXPELLED. WITHOUT ANY PROCESS. WITHOUT ANY HEARING. THERE'S NOTHING JUST BY BOAT SO. WHEN IT COMES THIS ISSUE -- FOUR NINE THREE MY CONCERN IS THE PROCESS. I THINK WE ALL CAN AGREE A LIKE THE WOMAN SAT BEFORE ME SAID THAT THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN AND HER AND I BOTH CAN AGREE. AT THE I WAS SUSPENDED I WAS GIVEN NOTHING. NO PROCESS NOT HEARING ANYTHING OF THE ONLY THING I WAS OF TO DO WAS JUST APPEAL TO THE STATE BOARD OF REGENTS. AND ULTIMATELY LED TO ME -- REPRESENTING MYSELF IN FEDERAL COURT -- CASE DISMISSED. HERE'S WHY. AS WE ALL KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE IS TESTIFIED BEFORE YOU GUYS AWARE OF THE OF DISADVANTAGES THAT COMES WITH -- COME FROM A FAMILY OF LESSER MEANS AND THE ALSO IN HER DISADVANTAGE OF BEING OF AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE. WE HAVE AN AMERICAN MILLION RISK YOU ACCUSE WHETHER SURE NOT OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND HARASSMENT. THE AUTOMATICALLY OPPORTUNITY. NO MYSTERY STORY -- NO TURNING WAS TO REPRESENT YOU. THAT WAS SIX YEARS AGO -- OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST SIX YEARS UP TO A LOT OF OUR WORK IN CONGRESS -- BUT THE STATE LEGISLATURES WELL -- WE RAISE THE ISSUE OF FALSE ACCUSATIONS TO NATIONAL PROFILE. AND THE NATIONAL PROFILE OTHER STATES ARE BEGINNING. TO TO FOLLOW SUIT AND MAKE CHANGES OF MISSOURI -- FOR ONE CALIFORNIA HOPEFULLY -- FOR TO ANDREW SITTING NEXT TO ME SHE WAS JUST A BILL -- ONE SIXTY NINE WE'VE HAD MEETINGS WITH -- CHAIRMAN LEYVA AS WELL AS SENATOR JACKSON AND ALMOST OF RESPECT YOUR EFFORT. BUT I THINK THE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON UP. GETTING THE PROCESS CORRECT. IT'S SO FRUSTRATING SO BEFORE YOU GUYS IN AND OUT HERE THIS ISSUE TURNED INTO A PARTISAN ISSUE THE NECESSARY POLITICAL PARTISAN BUT EITHER YOU'RE A VICTIM ADVOCATE OR YOU ARE A REBEL POLISHES. NOW LET'S ALL AGREE RAPE IS A HARMFUL THAT NEVER GOT THE FOR PROCES WE'RE NOT SITTING HERE ACROSS AND YOU GUYS IN OPPOSITION FROM SENATOR JACKSON WERE SAYING HEY. I ECHO THE WOMAN THE SEVEN FOR ME SAID THE PROCESS IS BROKEN BECAUSE IF YOU'RE HIT WITH A FALSE ACCUSATION. LET ME TELL YOU MY LIFE HAS BEEN EVER SINCE SIX YEARS LATER ONE THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS. ACADEMIC DEATH PENALTY. CAN TRANSFER TO ANOTHER COLLEGE MY UNIVERSITY WAS FORCED ENOUGH TO ALLOW ME TO COMPLETE THE FINAL REMAINING CLASS ONLINE. ADAM THIS IS A BECOME A LAWYER APPLY TO TWENTY LAW SCHOOLS REJECTED BY NINETEEN ONLY ACCEPTED THE ONE AFTER REACHED OUT AND FIND A SYMPATHETIC LAW SCHOOL DEAN THOSE SYMPATHETIC TO MY SITUATION. THAT WAS A STRUGGLE THAT I HAD TO DO TO GET INTO LAW SCHOOL NOW HERE WE ARE ON TURN THE CORNER. AS FAR AS THE PRESS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS CONCERNED AND I'M LOOKING FOR JOBS AND ULTIMATELY AN ADMIN SO THE CALIFORNIA STATE BAR. NOW EVERY JOB THAT I'VE APPLIED FOR INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA STATE BAR THERE IS A BOX THAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK THIS SAYS HAVE YOU BEEN ACCUSED.

HERE IT IS -- INTERNSHIP FOR THE SUMMER IS A RESPECTED LAW FIRMS AND I'M GETTING SO THE SAME KNOWS I GOT SO WHEN I WAS APPLYING. OF POSSIBLE REACHING OUT. A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAD INTEREST IN ME YOU WANT TO BEAT UP ON HIS CAMPAIGN AND THE FIRST QUESTION THAT HE ACTS. OF A VERY SOFT VETTING PROCESS WAS.

WE HAVE TO IN THIS RELATIONSHIP HERE AND I CAN ONLY TELL THEM UNDERSTAND. IN THE NATIONAL LANDSCAPING AS FAR AS CURRENT EVENTS ARE CONCERNED. I THINK WE ALL CAN AGREE THE CLIMATE IS CHANGED -- FALSE ACCUSATIONS ARE VERY REAL REALITY NO ONE WANTS TO BE WEAK ON ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. FALSE ACCUSATION WITHOUT PROCESS THEY AFFECT US ALL -- SITTING STANDING MEMBERS FORMER SENATOR MINNESOTA OUR RANKIN RESIGNED WITHOUT PROCESS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA.

THAT THE STATE CREATE SELENITE PROCEDURES THAT ARE DESIGNED. TO MAXIMIZE THE LIKELIHOOD OF A RELIABLE AND ACCURATE DECISION MAKING CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION NAME ORGANIZATION AND OPPOSITION. JONDO STRONGLY OPPOSED PARENT MAY I TAKE THIRTY SECONDS OF YOUR TIME [inaudible] NO [inaudible] THANK YOU. I'M A CALIFORNIA MOTHER I HAVE A SON AND A DAUGHTER BOTH THAT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES NAME.

AND TRY TO MAKE YOUR PRACTICES IN OR YOU'RE GUILTY PRESUMING FROM THE BEGINNING OF AMBASSADOR GAVE YOU MA'AM WE DO HAVE RULES AND REGULATIONS HERE I'M SORRY YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU. NAME ORGANIZATION OPPOSITION THIS IS NARROW SO I'M ALSO IN STRONG OPPOSITION OF THIS MY SON WAS FALSELY ACCUSED OF A KISS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU OPERATE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS. DOCTOR PAN. SENATE JACKSON I KNOW THAT -- YOU'VE WORKED VERY HARD ON THIS ISSUE AND I KNOW THAT ALSO -- YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO'S -- AS A WHO VERY MUCH VALUES -- THE IMPORTANCE OF THE APPROPRIATE JUDICIAL PROCESS IN FACT TEACHER. THE DISTRICT COMMITTEE -- NIGHT THE OPPOSITION. I THINK YOU MADE A POINT ABOUT -- WHAT THE WITNESSES ACTUALLY I DON'T IS GINGER TEACHER SELF AND YEAH MY NAME IS JOSEPH? OKAY I THANK YOU -- SO CERTAINLY I THINK ON ONE LEVEL I THINK -- ONE CAN ARGUE THAT THERE THIS MAY BE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS BUT SEEMS OUT FREE SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES ON RIGHT I MEAN -- SILICON SOURCES ALL THE PLACES CONTINUE PERHAPS SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO THAT -- THERE THE ISSUE ABOUT -- ON ONE LEVEL OF COURSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SCHOOLS AND THEIR PROCESSES WHICH ARE YOU KNOW WHEN TO SAY AS OUR MINISTRY TO EVENTS AND I FEEL SO WELL THIS ADMINISTRATIVE CRIMINAL WHAT STANDARD TO USE BUT THAT SAME TIME THE LEVEL CONSEQUENCES AND IT'S NOT GOING TO JAIL. FIVE I MEAN CERTAINLY IS VERY SIGNIFICANT TO CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT SURE AND THAT'S WHY WE WILL THAT'S WHY PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS SET UP AN APPROPRIATE ADMINISTRATOR. APPROPRIATE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS. THAT GIVES BOTH SIDES THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THEIR CASE -- THAT MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE PROCEDURES FOLLOWED WHERE THE FACTS CAN BE ASCERTAINED IN A A NON BIASED OR I SHOULD SAY IMPARTIAL. ACCURATE AND FAIR MANNER SO THAT THE PROCESS THAT THEN. IN SHOES IS ONE THAT GETS TO THE ACCURACY OF THE ALLEGATIONS AND THE RESPONSE TO THOSE ALLEGATIONS AND THEN A FINDING BASED UPON A DETERMINATION OF WHETHER IT'S MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE EVENT OCCURRED. AND ALSO IT ADDRESSES THE FACT THAT EACH INSTITUTION -- IS ABLE TO SET FOR THE ITS OWN -- RESPONSES ONCE A FINDING IS MADE. SO WE HEARD THE THE VICTIM OF THIS ASSAULT. TESTIFIED SHE HAD TO SEE THE HER RAPIST EVERY DAY -- AND YOU DIDN'T HEAR HER ASKING TO HAVE THAT PERSON -- REMOVED FROM CAMPUS TRANSOCEAN HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT ON A DAILY BASIS. THE WHOLE NOTION OF TRAUMA BASED -- A SENSITIVITY SO THAT A SHE HAD NEEDS TO TALK WITH PEOPLE AND POTENTIALLY A NEED TO HAVE THERAPY WHICH OBVIOUSLY WE SEE A LOT 34% OF WOMEN WHO ARE RAPED ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES WILL DROP OUT OF SCHOOL. IN GREAT MEASURE THAT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT. ABLE OR NOR SHOULD WE ASK THEM TO HAVE TO FACE. THEIR PERPETRATOR ON A DAILY BASIS OR OFTENTIMES ARE IN THE SAME DORM IN THE SENT THE REQUEST OF THE VICTIM IS LOOK I JUST DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO SEE THIS PERSON. WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING IT CAN BE? A KIND OF A SEVERITY THAT WOULD JUSTIFY -- OF FREQUENTLY TO THE EXTENT THAT SCHOOLS HAVE EVEN BOTHERED TO TRY TO TAKE THESE CASES SERIOUSLY AND I THINK WE HAVE TO START FROM THAT FUNDAMENTAL PRINT PREMISE. IS THAT SCHOOLS ARE STILL THERE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. THIS IS A WHAT THEY ARE AND KNOWN. FOR AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOW REQUIRING THAT THEY TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE STUDENTS WHO ATTEND THEIR SCHOOLS. THIS IS A ROAD MAP TO GIVE THEM OF THE KIND OF TOOLS THEY NEED TO DO THIS RIGHT. THE BES WAY TO DO THIS WOUD BE TO HAVE ALL THESE CASES TAKEN INTO CRIMINAL COURT AND WE HAVE A SYSTEM THERE THAT'S ALREADY WELL ESTABLISHED. BUT MOST OF THESE VICTIMS DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. AND WHAT OUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO STOP THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES ONE IN FIVE WOMEN. ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR CAREER. AND ONE IN FOURTEEN MEN. SO WE HAVE AN EPIDEMIC. THIS BILL TRIES TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT. NUMBER ONE THIS DOES OCCUR. NUMBER TWO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS TO PROCESS FOR BOTH SIDES AND I THINK THAT. THERE IS CHOOSE ME THAT COMMON THREAD EVERYBODY WANTS TO HAVE A FAIR PROCESS THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO IS TO CREATE A FAIR PROCESS. RECOGNIZING THE NEEDS OF VICTIMS AND OF OF SURVIVORS OF RECOGNIZING THAT FOR MOST SURVIVORS RAPE IS A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE. AND THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT IS SUCH. AN TO RECOGNIZE TO THAT THERE ARE SOMETIMES DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW AND THAT THOSE POINTS OF VIEW SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE PRESENTED TO WIN IT TO A AN INDEPENDENT NON BIASED FACT FINDER. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL TRIES TO DO. CAN I RESPOND PLEASE NO THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MA'AM WE WILL ASK YOU TO BE REMOVED IF YOU CANNOT CONDUCT YOURSELF PROPERLY. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE FROM THE COMMITTEE SENATOR DORADO. SENATE JACKSON -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR RAISING THIS ISSUE AND PROCEEDING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. BOB AND I KNOW THAT YOU ARE A STAUNCH CHAMPION FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AND FOR EVERYBODY TO BE TREATED -- RIGHT. WE ALSO KNOW. THAT IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM THAT. THE JAILS AND THE PRISONS ARE FULL OF PEOPLE OF COLOR PRIMARILY MEN OF COLOR BUT THAT IS ALSO PART OF OUR THE BAD SIDE. OF OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM AS WE KNOW THAT RACISM HAS PLAYED A BIG ROLE IN A MUCH BIGGER ROLE THAN IT SHOULD WHICH IS THE OTHER. EXTREME OF HOW VICTIMS AND WOMEN ARE TREATED. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT HOW DO YOU AND AND AND I KNOW YOU YOU JUST MENTIONED MAYBE EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE DUE PROCESS RIGHT RIGHT TO MAKE SURE? THAT EVERYONE STE EVERYONE HAS THAT DAY IN COURT IT WILL DOESN'T FEEL THEY'VE BEEN LEFT OUT I AM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE HERE WHEN I MENTIONED THAT THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO EMPLOYEES ENGAGED IN THIS PROCEDURE. ON BOTH A TRAUMA INFORMED BEST PRACTICES AS WELL AS TRAINING ON IMPLICIT BIAS. IN THE HISTORY OF INSTITUTIONAL RACISM AND RACIAL INEQUITIES IN SCHOOL DISCIPLINARY PROCESS SEES SO THAT WE HAVE THAT. AT SO THAT WE HAVE THAT -- CONSCIOUSNESS AND RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE THEIR ASSUMPTIONS MADE IMPROPERLY -- BASED UPON. RACIAL BIASES -- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MENTION TOO THAT THE DISTANT TEST TAKES AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN. BEING THE VICTIMS OF THE SEXUAL VIOLENCE ARE I THINK EVEN HIGHER THAN A WEEK WOMEN WHO ARE NOT OF COLOR. SO AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE WE WE NEED TO EDUCATE OURSELVES AND WE NEED TO EDUCATE THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO BE ASKED. TO INITIATE AND TO CONDUCT THOSE PROCEEDING SO THAT THEY CAN BE. AS ACCURATE AND THIS FACT DRIVEN AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE. THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OF THE COMMITTEE. VERY GOOD SIR JACKSON WHICH IS OUR MOTION. THANK YOU SENATOR RAZA SENATE JACKSON WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I KNOW THIS IS A DIFFICULT. ISSUE OF THE THAT -- IF IF THIS WERE PERFECT WORLD WOULD BE ABLE TO JUST SORT OF PUT A THUMB PRINT THAN WOULD FIND OUT WHETHER PEOPLE ARE TELLING THE TRUTH THAT WE'RE NOT TELLING THE TRUTH. BUDGET -- THAT ISN'T SO THE WORLD WE LIVE IN BUT WHAT WE CAN DO AND WHAT THIS BILL TRIES TO DO. IS MAKE THIS PROCESS AS FAIR AND ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE -- I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE ALL LOOKING FOR THE SAME RESULTS AS THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IS SOMEONE WHO. HAS SPENT. SEE I'VE BEEN AN ATTORNEY FOR OF NEVER MIND A LONG TIME OVER THIRTY YEARS -- PROBABLY CLOSER -- TO FORTY I AM COMMITTED. TO THE TO THE METHOD BY WHICH WE BRING. TO TO JUSTICE AS ACCURATELY AS FAIRLY AND AS CONSISTENTLY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL THAT WE WILL MAKE IT CLEAR THIS BEHAVIOR IS NOT ACCEPTABLE ON OUR CAMPUSES WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. AND THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WILL NOT HAVE TO HAVE THESE KINDS OF PROCEEDINGS GOING FORWARD SO WE DO KNOW THOUGH THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT IMPEDED STUDENTS RIGHT TO PURSUE AND RECEIVE AN EDUCATION. IN A SAFE NON DISCRIMINATORY ENVIRONMENT THAT'S THE EDUCATION PART OF THIS AND THIS MEASURE PROVIDES A BASELINE PROCESS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS WHEN IT COMES TO ENFORCEMENT OF THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS. TO BE AN EQUITABLE PROCESS AND TO BE TO GIVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO IN TITLE NINE AND ITS IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS. HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR STUDENTS SURVIVORS AND ADVOCATES HELPING TO MAKE OUR CAMPUSES A SAFER SPACE FOR STUDENTS. AND THIS MEASURE I BELIEVE CONTINUE SAID IMPORTANT WORKING WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON THE BILLS WERE MOVED BY SENATOR DORADO MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM FOURTEEN AS BEFORE NINETY THREE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO JUDICIARY LEYVA. LEYVA AYE WILK WILK AYE CHIANG CHIANG I'D WOULD ASAL. JUDGE RASOUL AYE GLAZER MCGUIRE MCGUIRE AYE PAN. PAN AYE. BELIEVE THAT BILL ON CALL BUT IT DOES HAVE ENOUGH VOTES TO GET OUT THANK YOU CENTER JACQUI MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. NEXT UP IS SENATOR BATES. SENATOR BATES PERCY WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PERCENT. SB. FIVE FORTY ONE ARE I AM I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WHICH APPEAR ON PAGE FOUR OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. AS AMENDED SB FIVE FORTY ONE REQUIRES ALL KINDERGARTEN THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS WITH AN ENROLLMENT OF FIFTY OR MORE STUDENTS TO CONDUCT ONE LOCKDOWN DRILL PER SCHOOL YEAR. GIVEN THE UNFORTUNATE THREATS TO CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS TODAY'S STUDENT VOLUNTEERS STAFF TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS CANNOT BE PREPARED ENOUGH FOR THE UNKNOWN. FROM DEVASTATING WILDFIRES TO ACTIVE SHOOTERS ON CAMPUS WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT ALL PEOPLE ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES ARE PREPARED TO ACT IMMEDIATELY WHEN CHILDREN'S UTMOST SAFETY IN MIND. EXISTING EDUCATION CODE REQUIRES ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS TO CONDUCT FIRE DRILLS REGULARLY AN INTERMEDIATE LEVEL AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS AT LEAST TWICE A YEAR. EXISTING STATUTE HOWEVER DOES NOT REQUIRE TRAINING FOR ANY OTHER TYPES OF THREATS THAT MAY OCCUR ON A CAMPUS. THAT MADE JEOPARDIZE THE SAFETY OF ALL ON CAMPUS SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE TAKEN IT UPON THEMSELVES TO PROVIDE THIS TRAINING. BUT IT IS CRITICAL FOR ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS AND CHILDREN TO BE PREPARED FOR EVERY SITUATION. LAST YEAR TREMENDOUS STRIDES ARE WERE MADE IN THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS SCHOOL SAFETY BUT MEASURES A LACK TO A REQUIREMENT TO CONDUCT A LOCKDOWN DRILLS. I AUTHORED SB TWELVE ALL THREE AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT PASSES COMMITTEE ON THE SENATE FLOOR UNANIMOUSLY WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. SB FIVE FORTY ONE IS NEEDED TO ENSURE ALL CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ARE MEETING A BASIC STANDARD TO HAVE ANNUAL LOCKDOWN TRAININGS ON SITE IN ORDER TO BE PREPARED. SERGEANT DERREN VERY I'M OUT WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE IS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES PLEASE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS SERGEANT-- RAM AND I AM PLEASEDTODAY TO REPRESENT THE ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE FORTY ONE WHICH REQUIRES ONE LOCKDOWN DRILL PER YEAR IN ALL K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS WITH FIFTY STUDENTS ARE MORE. IN MY CAPACITY AS A SERGEANT WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT I OVERSEE THE SCHOOL MOBILE SAYS MATT RESOURCE TEAM ALSO KNOWN AS SMART. THIS UNIT RESPONSE ALL INCIDENTS RELATED TO VIOLENCE THREATS OF VIOLENCE POSSESSION AND OUR USE OF WEAPONS UNSTABLE BEHAVIORS AND SUICIDAL ACTIONS ARE TENDENCIES. THAT POSE A THREAT TO OTHERS AT K. TWELVE SCHOOLS. THE ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT'S JURISDICTION INCLUDES THE LARGE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF CAPISTRANO AND SETTLE BACK VALLEY AND PORTIONS OF MANY NORTH ORANGE COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I SUPERVISE ALL OUR SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS AND DALY INTERACT WITH OUR EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS. THE EFFORTS OF SMART AND SIMILAR INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN IDENTIFYING AND ELIMINATING THREATS. FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN SMART FIELDED FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE CALLS FOR SERVICE. WHICH INCLUDED INVESTIGATING THREATS AS WELL AS INVESTIGATING REPORTS OF WEAPONS ON CAMPUS AND OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. THE TEAM MADE A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE ARRESTS OVER THOSE THREE YEARS AND A HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN OF THOSE STUDENTS WERE MANDATED TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR YOUTH OF OUR DIVERSION PROGRAM. EVEN WITH THE BEST OF EFFORTS AND SYSTEMS IN PLACE WE MUST ALWAYS BE PREPARED FOR THE WORST POSSIBILITY. CREATION MEANS PRACTICE STUDENTS FACULTY AND PARENTS. MUST KNOW WHAT TO DO AND WAS EXPECTED IN THE EVENT OF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER OR OTHER INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE. REQUIRE AN ACTIVE THREAT DRILLS WILL SAVE LIVES. WE KNOW THE STRATEGY OF REQUIRED SAFETY DRILLS IN CALIFORNIA THE SCHOOLS SCHOOLS ARE MANDATED. TO TO REQUIRED FIRE DRILLS. EVEN WITH THAT HEARINGS TO STRICT FIRE CODE AND THE USE OF FIRE SPRINKLERS SCHOOL FIRES CAN OCCUR. YES AS A RESULT THE SCHOOL FIRES HOWEVER ARE RARE. STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ARE WELL VERSED IN WHAT TO DO DURING A FIRE AND KNOW HOW TO SAFELY EVACUATE BECAUSE THEY PRACTICE. SIMILARLY WE MUST ENSURE PRACTICES A CRANE WITH REGARDS TO ACTIVE THREATS. AS WE ANALYZE THE TRAGIC SCHOOL SHOOTINGS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ABLE TO IDENTIFY COMMON THREADS IN TACTICS USED BY THE SHOOTERS. AS A RESULT WE ARE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE BEST SAFETY STRATEGIES THAT SHOULD BE EMPLOYED IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE OR REDUCE FATALITIES IN A SHOOTING INCIDENT OR THREAT OCCURRED. IN ONE OF OUR LOCAL CAMPUSES. THE BEST STRATEGIES HOWEVER ARE USELESS UNLESS THE BROADER SCHOOL COMMUNITY KNOWS WHAT TO DO WHEN THEY ARE IN DANGER. THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY'S RUN HIDE FIGHT PROGRAM IS ONE SUCH EXAMPLE OF THE USABLE STRATEGY. IS STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ARE NOT AWARE OF WHAT TO DO HOWEVER THE STRATEGIES MEANING LESS. THE LEGISLATION BEFORE YOU TODAY IS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO CODIFY A RECOGNIZE A BEST PRACTICE INTO LAW. SUCH A REQUIREMENT WILL ENSURE THAT OUR SCHOOLS DEDICATE TIME AT LEAST ONCE PER YEAR. TO PREPARE FOR A MOMENT IN TIME WHICH WE HOPE WILL NEVER OCCUR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY. THANK YOU I APOLOGIZE IT IN SAY TWO MINUTES EACH SO IF YOU CAN SIXTY TWO MINUTES PLEASE PICK IT IS OKAY NOT YOUR FAULT. AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND MY NAME IS YVONNE CARRY ON WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS. ACCESS SUPPORTS SB FIVE FOUR ONE BECAUSE CONDUCTING LOCKDOWN DRILLS AND BEING PREPARED TO RESPOND ACTIVE THREATS SAVES LIVES. NOTHING BETTER EXEMPLIFIES THIS THEN THE STORY OF RANCHO TO HAMMER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL UP IN CORNING CALIFORNIA. IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN A SHOOTER CAME ON A CAMPUS JUST BEFORE THE START OF SCHOOL. MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED ROUNDS WERE SHOT ON CAMPUS AN ATTEMPT TO KILL SMALL CHILDREN AND STAFF. THANK GOD NO ONE DIED THAT DAY. THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY WILL BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU THAT THIS WAS THE CASE BECAUSE THEY WERE PREPARED BY PERFORMING MONTHLY LOCKDOWN DRILLS. THE MOMENT A LOCKDOWN WAS CALLED STUDENTS WERE QUICKLY AN ORDERLY SECURED IN CLASSROOMS AND DOORS WERE LOCKED. THE GUNMAN HAD NO VISIBLE TARGETS AND WAS UNABLE TO GAIN ENTRANCE. ENTRANCE INTO THE CLASSROOMS WERE CHILDREN WERE HIDDEN. IT IS EASIER TO CONVINCE OURSELVES THAT THIS WILL NEVER HAPPEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THERE WILL BE MORE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS AND ALL COMMUNITIES ARE AT RISK. STUDENTS AND STAFF MUST BE PREPARED. THEY MUST BUILD THE MUSCLE MEMORY TO ACT QUICKLY AND BY THEMSELVES EVERY POSSIBLE SECOND. THE TO HIM INCIDENT AS PROOF THAT EVERY SECOND MATTERS IN THESE SITUATIONS. AT RANCHO TO HIM ELEMENTARY THE SHOOTER ANSWERED CAMPUS JUST EIGHT SECONDS AFTER THE LOCKDOWN HAD BEEN EXECUTED. A CLOSE BY SHARING THAT ACTS -- HAS DEVELOPED A SCHOOL CRISIS TO KATE AND AS IDENTIFIED BEST PRACTICES AS AS THEY RELATE -- TO LOCKDOWN DRILLS AND THE AND THESE -- THIS CALL TOOK HIS HOUSE ON OUR WEBSITE. AND WE THINK THE SENDER FOUGHT DURING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE AN ASPIN RIVAL. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR SHARING A GOOD STORY. US SENATOR AT THE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS IN SUPPORT OUR BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT. NONE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE CENTER PAN. THANK YOU AND CENTER BATES FIRST FALL I WANT TO THANK YOU -- FOR PRESENTING THE BILL ONLINE AT WILL NOT PULL THAT OFF CONSENT - AND I APPRECIATE -- WHAT YOUR WITNESS TO PRESENT AND THEN AND I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE -- YOUR YOUR DEDICATION TO CHILDREN AND THEIR SAFETY IN YOUR CAREER AND YOUR WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE SO I DEFINITELY WANT -- TO EMPHASIZE THAT -- MY CONCERN AND IT'S NOT SO MUCH WITH. MY MY I GUESS MY CONCERN ABOUT LOCKDOWN DRILLS AND I AND I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE THE WITNESSES OF SAID. IN TERMS OF IT'S IT'S GOOD WE SHOULD BE PREPARED RIGHT AND SELL NOT OPPOSED TO THAT. BUT I ALSO. TO BE SURE THAT WHEN WE'RE DOING THIS THAT WERE NOT ACTUALLY TRAUMATIZING THE STUDENTS -- AND SOMETIMES EVEN THE SPECKLED IN THE STAFF I THERE'S BEEN SOME NEWS REPORTS ABOUT -- ONES THAT PERHAPS WERE DONE -- OVER TO THE ETHNICALLY -- WHEN HAS TO THINK ABOUT SOME AREAS YOU HAVE YOU'RE TELLING -- ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SOON SO I APPRECIATE TO THAT WE HAD A A POSITIVE SALE AT YOU KNOW THAT THAT DID THE RESULTED AND AND AND AND AND AND A SITUATION WHERE NO STUDENT WAS -- WHAT WAS KILLED I THINK -- WE CAN TALK THE I. NATO THIS BILL ISN'T ABOUT WE CAN TALK ABOUT LARGER POLICIES TO TRY TO WITH THAT MIGHT BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THOSE TYPES OF INCIDENTS IN THE OPPORTUNITY BUT I I DO WANT TO JUST. TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. NO WE WON'T BE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS NOT ACTUALLY CREATING A TRAUMATIZE ARE CREATING FEAR IN. OUR STUDENTS AND OUR STAFF RIGHT THAT WE DO WANT TO TRAIN FOR RIGHT YOU DIFFERENT THINGS -- INCLUDING YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO IF THERE IS A SHOOTER -- AND OTHER TYPES OF SITUATIONS BUT I ALSO AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT AS A PEDIATRICIAN ABOUT YOUNG CHILDREN WHO BASICALLY BEING TOLD -- THAT SOME YOU KNOW THAT -- STE -- THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WANT TO COME TO YOUR SCHOOL AND KILL YOU NOW YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE A CERTAIN TRUTH TO THAT IT'S ACTUALLY THE GOOD NEWS IS IN THE DOLLARS AS I THOUGHTFULLY IT'S FAIRLY INFREQUENT. AND AND WHEN IT DOES HAPPEN THAT WE HAVE PUT THINGS IN PLACE TO PREVENT AY HARM. BUT IT SAME TIME -- I THINK YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO BE VERY. SENSITIVE TO THAT I KNOW THE THE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE SOME GUIDELINES AND I WILL BE SURE THAT. ASIDE FROM IT AND IN ADDITION TO SAYING THAT WE'RE GONNA DO LOCKDOWN DRILLS THAT THE PROCESS PROCESS THERE BE USED BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THEIR PARTNERS AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE. NO VERY GOOD PARTNERS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT OTHERS -- THAT ARE DONE IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT CREATE -- SITUATIONS WHERE THERE COULD BE TRAUMA TO THE STUDENTS -- WHO MAY HAVE ACTUALLY THEMSELVES EXPERIENCE VIOLENCE AT HOME ARE INJURED COULDN'T COMMUNITIES WELL SO CAN YOU PERHAPS PETER THAT MAYBE I DON'T KNOW BUT I I'M NOT I'M NOT A SPECIFIC AMENDMENT BUT PERHAPS IT THAT I THINK A ARE YOU WILL BE OPEN TO WORKING TO PUT? THAT AS PART THE GUIDELINES -- FOR IN TERMS OF IN THE BILL WHEN YOU SAY WE DON'T REQUIRE LOCKDOWN DRILLS. BOTH LEON SENATOR HANNAH DOCTOR POUND. IN FACT I THINK THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS THERE ARE GUIDELINES HERE IS PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE PART OF ALL THE BILL I THAT THAT BE INCLUDED IN BEST PRACTICES AS A EMPLOYEE ALL. FORWARD THEIR PLAN OF ACTION LEAVE THAT TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN ASSESSING OB WITH THEIR THEIR STUDENTS ARE EMOTIONALLY READY FOR SOMETHING LIKE A LOCKDOWN DRILL IT'S THE WAY THEY PRESENTED ISSUE NOW. IS NOT BAD WE'RE GOING TO COME TO SCHOOL AND SHOOT YOU IS THAT THERE CAN BE BAD PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT WOULD CAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS FOR YOU KNOW GOING OUT ON THE PLAYGROUND ON THEIR SIDE. THERE WAS SOMEONE NUMBER IF I THINK THAT WAS AN LA A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHERE SOMEONE IT CREE -- KID COMMITTED A BURGLARY AND LOCALLY -- WAS SOMEWHERE IN THERE IN THE REGION SO THEY LOCKED DOWN THOUGH THE SCHOOL DOWN AND SO IT'S THE WAY THEY PERCENT. DOWN JOB THESE ARE EXCELLENT GUIDELINES IN FACT THERE'S TWO TYPES OF LOCKDOWNS AND SOUNDS THAT THEY'RE RECOMMENDING THE PERIMETER ONE ASKED THE FIRST APPROACH YOU KNOW HERE'S WHAT WE GOT TO KEEP OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITY SAFE AND THIS IS A PRIVATE AREA WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE IT DOWN. TYPE THING SO IT'S THE WAY THEY DO IT BUT THIS IS EXCELLENT I THINK AND I DID NOT SEE THAT BY THE WAY. INTO WE PUT JOB THE PRESENTATION TOGETHER SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT TO ACTUALLY PULL THE BILL FROM CONSENT SO THAT WE CAN HAVE IT ON THE RECORD DISCUSSION THAT THIS SHOULD BE A PART OF THE OUR APPROACH TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TAKE. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT SURVEYS AND THAT REALLY APPRECIATE -- I KNOW SOMETIMES ANNOYING WHEN YOUR BILL AND CONSENT TO GET FULL BLOWN OUT TO BRING EVERYONE AND IT BY REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR REGULAR WELL AS HAVE THIS DIALOGUE AND FOR THAT WITH THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU. WE APPRECIATE YOU DODGE PAN I THINK WE ALL WISH WE WERE JUST KIDS AGAIN HAVE HIM AS OUR DOCTOR MAYBE. OKAY SIR SENATOR BED DANNY WHAT THE BILL FOR THAT. ONE YOU SEE THE DOCTOR PAN ANY OTHER COMMENTS AGREES CENTER DRAWS SO -- THANK YOU A CENTER BASE FOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- WHEN I WAS A KID I NEVER IMAGINED THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE HAVING TO HAVE DRILLS ABOUT A POTENTIAL THIS KIND OF GET INTO THE -- SO THANK YOU FOR THAT -- I'D WANT TO GET INTO TOO MUCH IN THE WEEDS BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT AROUND SHOOTINGS AND IN SCHOOLS -- THERE'S BEEN A BIGGER POLICY ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN. BROUGHT IN -- AROUND THE USE OF GUNS -- THERE'D BEEN PROPOSALS AND SOME OF SCHOOLS IN SOME STATES THAT TEACHERS SHOULD HAVE GUNS THAT. I MEAN YOU KNOW MAYBE MAINTENANCE SHOULD HAVE GUNS AND THE SORT OF STUFF SO. I'M TRYING TO PICTURE. MAKING SURE. HOW OR HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WHILE THIS PREPARATION IS DONE IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE FOR THE CHILDREN PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND EVERY WHERE ELSE? IS THAT IT DOESN'T BECOME AN OPPORTUNITY. TO TALK ABOUT. OTHER POLICY ISSUES AND INCORPORATE THEM IN THAT AND NOT SOME I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT -- HOW DO HOW DO WE? A AND IF IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE HERE BUT HOW DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD PROCEED WITH THAT SO THAT IT DIDN'T AND BECOME AN OPENING FOR ANOTHER POLICY DISCUSSION AROUND GUNS. THAT CERTAINLY WOULDN'T BE MY MOTIVATION WITH THIS BILL IT STRICTLY ON IT TO INSURE THAT MY CHILD YOUR CHILD. ANY CHILD WHO'S IN OUR AUDIENCE SCHOOL OFFENDING IS TOTALLY SAFE AND I THINK THAT OUR HEARTS YOU KNOW ACHE BLEED -- WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS I DON'T WANT A RECOUNT SOME OF THOSE THAT STILL GIVE ME A LUMP IN MY THROAT? SO THAT'S THE ONLY SINGLE INTENT OF THIS BILL THE THE LARGER DISCUSSION REGARDING HOW WE KEEP SCHOOLS SAFER. I THINK CARL WE'VE TALKED ABOUT NEEDLE ARMING SCHOOLS ARE YOU KNOW PUTTING FENCES AROUND EVERY ONE OF MANY MANY THOUGHTS COME FORWARD. BUT PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT INDIVIDUAL YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARD. TO SURVIVE AND THE ONLY WAY WE CAN PREPARE TO SURVIVE WHETHER IT'S IN THE WILDERNESS OR IT'S ON A SCHOOL CAMPUS IS TO KNOW WHAT TO DO. AND THAT IS TO CERTAINLY KNOW HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF AND THOSE WHO ARE. IN WE ARE IN THEIR KEEPING KNOW HOW TO HELP US PROTECT OURSELVES THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO CENTER BATES WHICH LIKE CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE DISCUSSION AGAIN TO SENATOR PAN AND TO THE CONSULTANTS ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR ANA LOOKING AT THESE.

FANTASTIC TEAM UP FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND OF COURSE WILL ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. HI AND I WANNA ALSO SITTING IN THE CHAIR FOR HER WORK ON CHILDHOOD HUNGER. PRIOR TO YOUR TIME IN THIS LEGISLATURE NOW. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT STUDENTS ARE CHALLENGED TO THRIVE IN THE CLASSROOM WHEN THEY'RE RUNNING ON AN EMPTY STOMACH. IN CHILDHOOD HUNGER IS AN EPIDEMIC IN OUR STATE WITH MORE CHILDREN IN POVERTY HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN AMERICA. NEARLY TWO MILLION CHILDREN ARE FOOD INSECURE. PATRICIA SCHOOL MEALS ACCOMPANIED WITH LOCAL CALIFORNIA GROWN FRESH FRUIT AND VEGGIES ARE ESSENTIAL WAY TO ENSURE STUDENTS ARE GETTING THE FOOD THEY NEED TO LEARN AND GROW. THROUGH TEN CENT PER BREAKFAST REIMBURSEMENT SB FOUR NINETY NINE IS WHAT WE CALL A WIN WIN WIN. FIFTY FOUR NINETY NINE INCENTIVIZE THE SCHOOLS TO PURCHASE CALIFORNIA GROWN PRODUCE -- BY PROVIDING THEM ENHANCE MEAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE STATE TO SUPPORT LOCAL FARMERS. THIS SMALL INCENTIVE WILL HAVE BIG IMPACTS THIS DIME WILL PROVIDE STUDENTS BETTER ACCESS TO LOCALLY GROWN HEALTHY UNIVERSAL MEALS CAN SUPPORT OUR LOCAL CALIFORNIA FARMERS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE AUTHORED THE SUCCESSFUL SB. ONE THIRTY EIGHT EIGHT REQUIRED SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH HIGH POVERTY SCHOOL POPULATIONS TO PROVIDE BREAKFAST AND LUNCH FREE OF CHARGE TO ALL THEIR STUDENTS. THIS IS A MUCH NEEDED STEP TOWARD ADDRESSING CHILDHOOD HUNGER IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN THE CLASSROOMS. RESEARCH TIME AND TIME AGAIN IS SHOWN US THAT BREAKFAST IS IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS HEALTH IN ACADEMIC SUCCESS. AFFECTED SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAMS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER TEST SCORES BETTER GRADES IN POSITIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS. IN TO A STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS. STUDENTS IN SCHOOLS THAT OFFERED FREE BREAKFAST BEFORE CLASS SCORED ABOUT 25% HIGHER ON MATH AND READING AS WELL SCIENCE TEST. HOWEVER AS STUDENTS ACCESS TO HELP THE SCHOOL MEALS IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF FOOD AVAILABILITY. IT'S ALSO ABOUT OUTSTANDING BARRIERS TO STUDENTS BENEFITING FROM SCHOOL MEALS AND THAT'S ALSO QUALITY FOOD. CALIFORNIA'S BETTER UTILIZE THE RESOURCES OUR OWN BACKYARD INCLUDING HEALTHY FRESH PRODUCE GROWN IN OUR STATE TO SUPPORT STUDENT HEALTH. IN LEARNING IN ONLY ABOUT 55% OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS PARTICIPATE IN FARM TO SCHOOL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS SERVING LOCALLY GROWN FOODS AN EXTRA COSTS THAT IT TAKES TO BE ABLE TO BUY DIRECTLY FROM A LOCAL FARMER PURCHASE LOCAL. FOOD LOCAL FOODS. EVEN THOUGH IT'S JUST A DIE MORE PER MEAL IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST HURDLES FOR SCHOOLS TO PURCHASE CALIFORNIA GROUND. AS BEFORE NINETY NINE IS MODELED AFTER A PREVIOUS SUCCESSFUL PILOT PROGRAM IT PROVIDES A TEN CENT PER BREAKFAST REIMBURSEMENT FOR CALIFORNIA AROUND FRESH FRUITS AND VEGGIES TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS. IN BACK TO BETTER NUTRITION AND IT PROMOTES PURCHASING BY PURCHASING LOCALLY. VENTURE ISLAND IT RIGHT HERE AND SAY WE'RE GRATEFUL TO MISS PATTERSON USE HERE TO OFFER A TWO MINUTE TESTIMONY SHE'S A DIRECTOR OF THAT LEGISLATION AT THE CALIFORNIA FOOD -- POLICY ADVOCATES AND WE ALSO HAVE DAVID RUDENSTINE HE'S POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE COMMITTEE LINES WITH FAMILY FARMERS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU SO MUCH MANAGER. THANK YOU CENTER MCGUIRE WITNESSES AND SUPPOSE SUPPORT PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE I'M TRACY PATTERSON WITH CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES WERE A STATEWIDE ANTI HUNGER ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION. OVER REALLY GRATEFUL FOR CENTER REQUIRES LEADERSHIP ON AS BEFORE NINETY NINE WHICH WOULD CREATE AND SUSTAIN. EQUITABLE HEALTHY HUNGER FREE SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA -- SO ASSN REQUIRE SAID CHILD HUNGER IS A REAL PROBLEM IN OUR STATE I'M PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME WORKING FOR FAMILIES WHO MIGHT MOVE IN AND OVER THE LINE OF ELIGIBILITY FOR DIFFERENT SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. SCHOOL MEALS THAT ARE FREE FOR ALL IN HIGH NEED COMMUNITIES CAN REALLY HELP FILL THE GP -- IN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE SEEN SOME REAL IMPROVEMENTS THEIR STATE POLICY AT THE FEDERAL OPTIONS CALLED COMMUNITY ELIGIBILITY WHICH PROVIDE FORMULA FUNDING THAT GIVE SCHOOLS REVENUE TO FEED. OUR MEALS FREE OF CHARGE TO ALL STUDENTS -- THIS REMOVE SOME OF THAT UNPAID KNEELED THAT CYCLE THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT EARLIER AND MAKE SURE THAT SCHOOLS GET FUNDING SO THAT THEY CAN BROUGHT PROVIDE THOSE MEALS FREE OF CHARGE TO EVERYONE. AND SO AS BEFORE NINETY NINE SIX TO BUILD UPON THAT PROGRESS AND THEN ALSO ADDRESS SOME OF THE REMAINING BARRIERS THE STIGMA AND QUALITY OF FOOD -- AND SO WHEN WE TALK DIRECTLY WITH YOUTH FAMILY IN SCHOOLS -- THE SAME KINDS OF THINGS COME UP OVER AND OVER STUDENTS WANT MEALS THAT ARE FRESH TASTE GOOD AND THAT DOESN'T MAKE THEM FEEL EMBARRASSED AMONG THEIR PEERS ESPECIALLY WITH MIDDLE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. ARE FAMILIES WANT SCHOOL TO PROVIDE FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT ARE OFTEN FINANCIALLY OUT OF REACH AT HOME. AND SCHOOLS WANT TO FEED KIDS GOOD FOOD AND THEY ALSO WANT TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS AND PAPERWORK THAT SLOWS THEM DOWN -- SO WE'RE THRILLED FOR A CENTER REQUIRES EFFORTS ON AS BEFORE NINETY NINE AND WE URGE YOU FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED. YES MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE -- OUR ORGANIZATION CALF WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FARMS SCHOOL PROGRAMS FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS IN CALIFORNIA. AND I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT ONLY PARTICIPATING WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK HARDER ON THAT -- WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED IN PARTICULAR IN RECENT YEARS ON A HELPING SCHOOL SOURCE LOCAL PRODUCE WE RUN A PROGRAM. IT KIND OF ACTING AS AN INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE SCHOOLS AND FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN WE HELP THE SCHOOLS -- EVERY RIGHT THEIR CONTRACTS -- AND SO -- THEY CAN REQUIRE. THE THE DISTRIBUTORS SAID TO BRING THEM LOCAL PRODUCE THAT IS WORK QUITE WELL -- THE SCHOOLS ALWAYS LACK FUNDING THIS BILL WILL HELP -- IT'S ALWAYS A PROBLEM -- AND THEN OF COURSE THE SHAMING OF THE STUDENTS -- I THINK THIS BILL -- YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT REQUIRES UNIVERSAL FREE BREAKFAST AND LUNCH -- I THINK THAT WILL HELP ON THAT AD WE HEARD FROM SENATOR HERTZBERG ABOUT THAT AND I READ AN ARTICLE -- JUST YESTERDAY THAT IN NORTHERN EUROPE THEY HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM IN PLACES LIKE NORWAY AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. OF THE SHAMING OF STUDENTS -- AND I I NEVER I NEVER REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU KNOW CHILDREN NEED TO ADD TO BE ABLE TO LEARN AND THEY NEED TO GOOD FOOD AND SO MANY OF THESE POOR CHILDREN MOST OF THEIR NUTRITION COMES AT SCHOOL. AND SO I THINK ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO. TO HOPE THAT -- IS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- YOU KNOW AT FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE READY TO HELP WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

MCGUIRE AYE PAN PAN AYE. BILLS ENOUGH TO GET OUT BUT WE WILL KEEP IT ON CALL WE ARE DOWN TO OUR LAST BILL THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU BEEN HERE ALL MORNING WITH US. LAST BUT DEFINITELY NOT LEAST SB SIX SEVENTY FIVE BY SENATOR CHIANG. IN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIRWOMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SB SIX SOME FIVE OR THE CODE ACT. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION IS CARD TO ASSEMBLE A CALIFORNIA COMPUTER SCIENCE STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. A PANEL OF EXPERTS FROM ACROSS THE STATE HAVE WORK TO PUT THE STRATEGIC PLAN TOGETHER. LATE LAST YEAR THE PANEL PUT FORTH A DRAFT OF RECOMMENDATIONS ONE OF THOSE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS IS TO PROVIDE SUSTAIN. DEDICATED FUNDING AND STAFF AT THE STATE LEVEL LOCAL LEVEL TO SUPPORT. COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION EFFORTS IN THE NEXT ONE TO TWO YEARS THIS BILL STAR SET UP FOR BY CALLING FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A GRANT PROGRAM. TO SUPPORT COMPUTER SCIENCE IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE THROUGH NEW LOTTERY FUNDS. CALIFORNIA MAY BE HOMES SILICON VALLEY BUT THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN THE COMPUTING AND TECHNOLOGY FIELDS WILL GO ON FIELD. BECAUSE TODAY'S STUDENTS ARE NOT PREPARED FOR THESE INDUSTRIES. ONLY 12% OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLS OFFER COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES YET OVER 90% OF PARENTS WANT THEIR CHILD TO LEARN COMPUTER SCIENCE IN SCHOOL. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE ONLY SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX GRADUATES WITH DEGREES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES DID NOT PRODUCE A SINGLE NEW TEACHER PREPARED TO TEACH COMPUTER SCIENCE DESPITE THE FACT THAT COMPUTER OCCUPATIONS MAKE UP OVER. HALF OF ALL PROJECTED NEW JOBS IN THE STEM FIELDS. BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND PUT TWENTY TWENTY SIX THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS ESTIMATES THAT. JOBS IN THE COMPUTER AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY WILL OUTPACE JOB GROWTH IN OTHER INDUSTRIES. IT IS PROJECTED THAT DURING THAT TIME FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND NEW JOBS WILL BE CREATED WITH. AN ANNUAL MEDIAN WAGE OF EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA DOES NOT PROVIDE DEDICATED FUNDING FOR RIGOROUS COMPUTER SCIENCE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND COURSE SUPPORT. THIS BILL WOULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF STATE LOTTERY FUNDS THAT MUST BE MADE AVAILABLE TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND COMMIT THOSE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION. IN OTHER WORDS THESE ARE NEW FUNDS FOR SCHOOLS NOT TAKEN AWAY FROM EXISTING FUNDS WERE ADDING NOT SUBTRACTING. THIS IS A SMALL FOR STEP TO ENSURE STUDENTS ARE GETTING APPROPRIATE COMPUTER SCIENCE SKILLS WE NEED TO PROVIDE KIDS WITH THE TOOLS TO SUCCEED IN A DRASTICALLY CHANGING WORLD THAT REVOLVES AROUND CáC. TO QUOTE APPLE CO FOUNDER AND TECH VISIONARY STEVE JOBS. SCIENCE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE OF THE IS A LIBERAL ARTS IT'S SOMETHING EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW HOW TO USE AT LEAST. AND HARNESS IN THEIR LIFE. PLEASE JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO HELP PREPARE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS TO BE COMPETITIVE IN THE WORK FORCE AND BECOME LEADERS AND THE TECHNOLOGY AND COMPUTING INDUSTRY. AND WITH ME I HAVE AND WE HAD TO VOTE WITH CO DOT ORG. THANK YOU CENTER CHAN PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU SENATOR FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS EFFORT GOOD AFTERNOON I HAD MORNING IN HERE BUT NOW IT'S GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS ANDREA DIVO I'M HERE REPRESENTING CO DOT ORG TODAY -- CO DOT ORG IS A NONPROFIT I DEDICATED TO EXPANDING THE AXIS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE IN SCHOOLS AND INCREASING PARTICIPER DISSIPATION BY WOMEN AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES WE BELIEVE EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN COMPUTER SCIENCE. WE HAVE SEEN A RECORD NUMBER OF COMPUTER SCIENCE BILLS INTRODUCED THIS YEAR AND THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION IS ALSO MAKING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TO EXPAND. ACCESS -- WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE K.THROUGH TWELVE COMPUTER SCIENCE STANDARDS AND THE SOON TO BE ADOPTED COMPUTER SCIENCE STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY THIS PROGRESS AND ARE HOPEFUL THAT CALIFORNIA CAN SOON BE SOON BECOME. THE LEADING STATE FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION LEAVING CALIFORNIA TO BECOME THE LEADING STATE WITH THE TALENT TO FEEL OUR FUTURE WORKFORCE. ONE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL FACTOR FOR THIS TO BE ACHIEVED IS TRAIN TEACHERS -- WITHOUT TEACHERS -- BEING ABLE TO TEACH COMPUTER SCIENCE WE DO THAT IS NEEDED. TODAY VERY FEW HIGH SCHOOLS OFFER COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES A RECENT ANALYSIS OF SECONDARY COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSE OFFERINGS IN CALIFORNIA. CONDUCTED BY THE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD INSTITUTE REVEALED THAT TEN OF THE TWENTY LARGEST DISTRICTS IN THE STATE DID NOT OFFER ADVANCED PLACEMENT CAN BE -- SCIENCE AND FIVE OF THESE DISTRICT DID NOT OFFER ANY COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES AT ALL. IN THE DECADE ENDING IN 202473% OF STEM JOB GROWTH WILL BE IN COMPUTER OCCUPATIONS BUT ONLY 3% WILL BE -- IN THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES AND 3% AND LIFE SCIENCES THE GREATEST BARRIER SCHOOLS HAD TO OFFER COMPUTER SCIENCE IS A LACK OF TEACHERS TRAINED TO DO IT. SB SIX SEVENTY FIVE SUPPORTS INCREASE THE MUCH NEEDED MECHANISM TO SUPPORT OUR TEACHERS TO PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT -- AND PROVIDING THE TOOLS THAT ARE NAY ARE NEEDED TO DEVELOP OUR CURRENT TEACHING WORKFORCE TO TEACH COMPUTER SCIENCE THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME TODAY RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEFORE WE GO TO ADDITIONAL SUPPORT CENTER CHAIN DO YOU TAKE THE AMENDMENTS OF THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED. YES YES OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. LEIGH ANGELA READ ON BEHALF OF PROJECT LEAD THE WAY IN STRONG SUPPORT. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION FIRST WANT TO SAY LOVE CODING WE ACTUALLY HAVE A COATING CATERPILLAR FOR OUR DAUGHTER SO -- VERY MUCH -- LOVE THE CONCEPT WITH THE OF WITH THE MEASURES TRYING TO ACHIEVE UNFORTUNATELY CTA DOES OPPOSE THE MEASURE FOR TWO REASONS FIRST OF ALL THE BILL DOES CREATE A CATEGORICAL SO YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY TELLING SCHOOL DISTRICTS YOU CAN'T SPEND THIS THE MONEY THAT YOU'RE RECEIVING FROM LOTTERY FUNDS. ON ANYTHING THAT YOU PRIORITIZE TO YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITY IN YOUR EL CAP PROCESS YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY DIVERT FUNDS IN SPECIFICALLY PUT THEM INTO THIS AREA SO WE DO OPPOSED TO AYE CATEGORICAL IS ESPECIALLY SINCE IT WOULD ELIMINATE LOCAL CONTROL -- BUT EDITION ONLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS DIVERTING LOTTERY FUNDS I AND SO WE WE DO -- OPPOSE THAT DIRECTION WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE DIRECTION THAT THIS WOULD ACTUALLY SHIP LOTTERYFUNDING. WE HAVE ASKED FOR SOME EVIDENCE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY SHOW THAT IF YOU CHANGE THE PRICES OF LOTTERIES IT WOULD REDUCE AN OVERALL SYSTEMIC INCREASE IN FUNDING THAT. RECEIVED A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO IT WAS SEEN THAT EDUCATION FUNDING THROUGH LOTTERY WHICH WE KNOW IT'S A BIT SMALL DID THIS THIS IS A VERY VERY SMALL PORTION VERY VERY SMALL PORTION OF SCHOOLS BUDGETS. BUT NEVER THE LESS THERE WAS A TREND WERE A LOTTERY SALES WERE DECLINING THEREFORE IT THE REVENUE THAT WOULD GO TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WAS DECLINING AS WELL THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. TO INCREASE THE LOTTERY PRIZES IN EVEN THOUGH SCHOOLS WOULD RECEIVE LESS OVERALL BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE MORE SALES CUMULATIVELY SCHOOLS WOULD SEE INCREASED AMOUNTS OF FUNDING. AND SO IT BEFORE IT THOSE CALCULATIONS ARE SHIFTED WE WANT TO HAVE SOME ASSURANCE THAT NUMBERS HAVE BEEN CRUNCHED AND THAT WE WOULD SEE AN OVERALL INCREASE. IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDS THAT ARE GOING TO EDUCATION OTHERWISE THIS IT COULD ACTUALLY LEAD TO AN OVERALL DECLINE IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF LOTTERY FUNDS THAT WE RECEIVED. SO THIS COULD HAVE THE ON AND CHAU IMPACT OF LOWER RANGE OF TOTAL LOTTERY FUNDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS GET IN THE LONG RUN SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT THE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN CRUNCHED IT WE'VE WE HAD AN ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS TO SHOW THE SCHOOLS WILL INDEED RECEIVE INCREASE FUNDING -- IF THAT CAN HAPPEN THAT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT CONVERSATION HOWEVER WE WOULD NOT SUPPORT ACTUALLY CREATING A CATEGORICAL WITH A LOTTERY FUNDS BECAUSE YOU ARE DIVERTING FUNDS. THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE GONE TO SCHOOL SO WE DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT CENTER CHIANG IS TRYING TO HAVE A CREATIVE APPROACH. AND WE DO WE DO LIKE CREATIVE APPROACHES BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE -- SHIFTS IN LOTTERY FUNDS AND WE UNFORTUNATELY DON'T SUPPORT CATEGORICAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. OUR WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE CENTER PAN. I THINK THANK YOU -- SEARCHING AND I'D APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING -- TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE ABOUT -- FREE EQUITY THERE SO THAT MORE STUDENTS WOULD HAVE -- EXPERIENCE WITH -- CODING AND SO FORTH BUT I THINK -- PROPOSED TO THE OPPOSITION'S QUESTIONS I GUESS ASIDE FROM THE CATEGORICAL ISSUE BUT IN TERMS OF THE LOTTERY FUNDING OVERALL I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU SHARED WITH ME THAT THIS IS -- IN IT THIS THIS WITHOUT DIVERT ANY EXISTING LOTTERY FUNDING FROM -- WHERE IT'S CURRENTLY GOING TO EDUCATION SO THIS IS ADDITIONAL BUT I GUESS I'D HAVE TO ASK QUESTION WE DO THIS AND INITIATIVES ALL TIME? ARE YOU WILLING TO PUT IN A BACK FILLED TO ENSURE THAT THAT AMOUNT BECAUSE OF IT ACTUALLY DOES SUPPRESS DIRECT LAW RETURNS. THAT THERE'S THAT WE PROTECT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CURRENTLY GOES EDUCATION THE LOTTERY SO WE'RE CHANGING THE FORMAL WHATEVER. WE PUT IT BACK FILL AND TO BE SURE THAT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO DEPEND FIRST OFF I GUESS THE THE THE REGIONAL FUNDS THEREFORE DON'T. KNOW SHRINK AS WE'RE TRYING TO TO I GUESS GOING TO THAT WELL FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE IS IS THAT IT IS. TO TO MEET INTENT OF WHAT YOU SAID IN TERMS OF FOR THE FUNDING COMING FROM ABSOLUTELY SO SO THE BILL JUST INCREASES THE AMOUNT THAT THE STATE LOTTERY FUNDS -- THAT MUST BE MADE PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO THE TO AT LEAST IN MY ALLOCATE ON THE AVERAGE OF PRIOR FIVE FISCAL YEARS OR AT LEAST AS MUCH WITHOUT LOOKING FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR AND ALSO THIS IS JUST FOR THREE YEARS FOR THE STATE. THE SCHOOL YEARS OF 202-020-2120 TWO TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO TO TWENTY THREE SO IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT GOING IT IS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO TO TAKE FROM. THE EXISTING FUNDS AND THAT'S ALREADY A STATED IN THE BILL OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I I JUST AND I HOPE THAT YOU'LL HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION OF THE OPPOSITION I I'M JUST ALSO SAYING THAT. WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT BACK TO BILL PROVISION TO GUARANTEE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN SO IN OTHER WORDS I WILL GET. DEFINITELY OPEN TO THAT OKAY ALL RIGHT AND AND I MEAN THERE'S ANOTHER WHOLE ISSUE CATEGORICAL BUT I DO WANT THE CONVERSATION CONTINUES I THINK YOU HAVE SOME IDEAS THAT THE LIKE BUT BUT AT LEAST ON THE FUNDING SIDE I WANNA BE SURE WE ACTUALLY TRULY DO PROTECT. BLOODY FUNNY THAT CURRENTLY GOES TO EDUCATION AND THAT WE'RE NOT CUTTING THAT'S DIMINISH BECAUSE WE GOT FEWER PEOPLE DOING THE LOTTERY OR WHATEVER ELSE AND THAT THAT THERE'S A BACK FILL. THAT LEASE IN PLACE AS WELL TO BE SURE THAT THAT FUNDING DOESN'T GO DOWN. THANK YOU AND I I DO WANT TO NOTE YOU KNOW AND I BELIEVE YOU GUYS HAVE PROBABLY GONE THIS CHART A FIFTY IF MY STAFF HAS ENOUGH. YES SO. THE FUNDING THE REVENUES ARE GOING UP SKYROCKETING AND FUNDING TO EDUCATION IS FLAT LINED I'M NOT SOMETHING THAT WE DEFINITELY SHOULD BE LOOKING INTO. AND I JUST WANT TO KIND OF ANSWER THE QUESTION OF OF THE YOU KNOW CATEGORICAL BUT IF WE DON'T ESTABLISH DEDICATED FUNDING LEAVE IT TO L. CFF WE MAY ACTUALLY EXACERBATE THE ISSUES. AROUND EQUITY IN LOW INCOME DISTRICTS AND I THINK THIS IS SUCH AS THE CREDIBLE IMPORTANT -- A POINT TO MAKE IN MAKING SURE OUR KIDS ARE GETTING THE COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS AS WE ALL KNOW THE FUTURE SO. THANK YOU IN THIS BILL IS REFERRED TO GEO AFTER THIS SO MAYBE YOU CAN TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE ELEMENTS THAT ANYTHING ELSE ON THE COMMITTEE. SENATOR DRAWS A YES -- I TO THANK YOU -- REALLY AGREE WITH THAT WITH THE POLICY SIDE OF IT I I THINK IT'S MY GRANDDAUGHTER JUST GOT. INTO A SHE'S TEN AND SHE JUST GOT INTO A A STEM YOU KNOW. KIND OF I GUESS THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IT AND ALL THAT -- AND SHE'S REALLY EXCITED AND THAT'S THE WAY TO GO IT'S NOT JUST HOW TO USE AN IPAD BUT IT'S REALLY TO LEARN. WHAT'S INSIDE THAT COMPUTER HOW DO YOU MAKE IT WORK FOR US SO -- ON THE OTHER HAND I I'M NOT YET COMFORTABLE WITH THE TAKING THE FUNDING FROM THE LOTTERY -- HOW WOULD THAT IMPACT I THINK THERE'S JUST A LOT MORE THAT I NEED TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I'M? I'M WORRIED. THAT WITH A THE GOOD INTENTION ON THE POLICY SIDE THAT THERE'S GONNA BE A IMPACT THAT HASN'T YET BEEN. FIGURED OUT SO -- THAT'S THE PART THAT I'M MOST CONCERNED ABOUT WHILE STILL SUPPORTING THIS AND I DO BELIEVE THAT FROM THE STATE WE HAVE TO PUSH. THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THEY HAVE A LOT OF MANDATES THAT COST A LOT OF MONEY. BUT I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE TO PUSH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ADOPT OF THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS OTHERWISE. IT'S JUST GONNA BE LEFT OUT THERE HANG IN AND ESPECIALLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR GIRLS. ARE NOT GETTING ACCESS TO THIS SO I'M REALLY CAUGHT BETWEEN THE TWO BUT I DON'T WANNA IMPACT OUR OF FUNDING FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION BY DOING THIS IN A WAY THAT I'M I'M STILL NOT FULLY COMFORTABLE WITH. SO -- AGAIN WE ARE NOT TAKING FROM EXISTING FUNDING WE'RE ASKING WE'RE ACTUALLY TAKING MORE MONEY FROM THE PAY OUT -- TO CONTRIBUTE -- TO THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM SO WE ARE NOT DEFINITELY NOT TOUCHING WHAT IS. AS A CURRENTLY THERE. THE CENTER DRAWS OF THANK YOU CENTER CHANNEL CENTER GLAZER. YEAH I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE GOALS THAT YOU SET FOR WHAT WHY WE WANT TO DIRECT MONEY IN THAT WAY AND BUT THERE IS SOME COMPLEXITY TO THIS I KNOW I'M GONNA HEAR THE BILL AGAIN IN GEO AND AND A FEW DAYS -- HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD TODAY BUT UNDERSTANDING I I STILL HAVE SOME HESITATION ABOUT IT. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER AKANE TAKE THAT AS A MOTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYTHING ELSE ON THE COMMITTEE. CENTER CHANNEL JUDGE CLOSE. THIS WANTED. TO MENTION THAT AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD MOST POPULOUS THE NATION CALIFORNIA IS AT RISK. OF LOSING ITS COMPETITIVE EDGE IF WE DON'T ACT NOW AND BY CREATING THIS GRANT PROGRAM -- DEDICATED TO FINDING COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS WE CAN GIVE CALIFORNIA STUDENT GREATER ADVANTAGE TO LEAD IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IN WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE.
