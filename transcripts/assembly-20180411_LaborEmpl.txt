THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HANDS MEMBERS. TODAY I AM PRESENTING AB TWENTY NINE SEVENTY FOUR. A BILL WHICH AIMS TO BETTER POWER SMALL LOCAL BUSINESSES BY ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE ADEQUATE SUPPORT. REPUBLIC CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL REQUIRES LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF EMPLOYERS TO ALIGN WITH PUBLIC CONTRACTING NEEDS THAT WILL SUPPORT LOCAL WORKFORCE OPPORTUNITIES. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED IN THE WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT WHICH SET NEW STANDARDS FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT NATIONWIDE. THE ACT ALONG WITH STATE LAW. REQUIRES OF BOARDS LEAD EFFORTS TO ENGAGE WITH A DIVERSE RANGE OF EMPLOYERS AND STAKEHOLDERS TO ACHIEVE GOALS. THESE GOALS INCLUDE PROMOTING BUSINESS REPRESENTATION ON BOARDS AND DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE LINKAGES WITH EMPLOYERS TO SUPPRT THE UTILIZATION OF THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT CENTERS. SUPPORT ECONOMIC GROWTH. LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S ARE TRULY WORKING AT THE GROUND LEVEL. AND HAVE AN INNATE UNDERSTANDING OF BUSINESS AND WORKFORCE NEEDS. DO TO THEIR LOCAL INTERACTION WITH EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. REGULARLY STATE CONTRACTING CAN BE COMPLICATED. TO ACCESS SUPPORT FOR LOCAL EMPLOYERS AS THEY SEEK TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO GROW AND DRIVE LOCAL WORKFORCE DEMANDS. THIS MAKES IT IMPERATIVE THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO INCLUDE ALL REGIONS OF THE STATE AND EMPOWER THEM WITH THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE TO THRIVE.

WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TO LET THESE. LOCAL BUSINESSES OF SMALL BUSINESSES GETTING EQUAL CHANCE WE AGREE IN THANK YOU SAYS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO JOBS COMMITTEE THURMAN AYE THURMOND AYE FLORA GONZALEZ FLETCHER JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER AYE KALRA. KALRA I. MCCARTY MELENDEZ. MELINDA'S BY THE. YOU BILLS OUT COLLISIONS. WE WILL CALL NEXT ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA TO PRESENT AB TWENTY NINE FORTY SIX LOCAL SERVER READY WHEN YOU ARE. SO CLOSE I CAN MISTER CHAIRMAN THERE'S. AB TWENTY NINE FORTY SIX INCREASES THE STATURE LIMITATIONS WERE FILING A WORKER RETALIATION CLAIM FROM SIX MONTHS TO THREE YEARS AND HAS THE ABILITY TO SEEK ATTORNEY'S FEES. FOR PREVAILING EMPLOYEES. WORKPLACE RETALIATION OCCURS AMPLY EMPLOYERS DISCHARGED THREATEN TO DISCHARGE DEMOTE SUSPEND OR SUBJECT EMPLOYEES TO AN ADVERSE ACTION INCLUDING THREATS OF DEPORTATION. FOR EXERCISING THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE LABOR CODE. RETALIATION IS NOT ONLY PERVASIVE BUT ALSO A GROWING PROBLEM TO THE CURRENT POLITICAL CLIMATE SURROUNDING IMMIGRATION. IN FACT IN ITS TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN RETALIATION COMPLAINT REPORT THE LEGISLATURE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER STATES OF THAT THERE'S A TWENTY TWO PERCENT INCREASE IN CASE ACCEPTED. UP FROM TWENTY THREE UP FROM A TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE TWENTY PERCENT JUMP. THIS NUMBER DOES NOT INCLUDE THE CASE THAT WE'RE NOT BOB FOR VARIOUS REASONS LACK OF AWARENESS. OF THE LENGTH THE STASH LIMITATIONS DIFFICULT DEFINING LEGAL REPRESENTATION. BY THE PAPERWORK OR GATHERING EVIDENCE ALL WITHIN A NARROW SIX MONTH WINDOW. TO THE CURRENT POLITICAL CLIMATE IMMIGRANT WORKERS ARE OFTEN AFRAID TO COME FORWARD WORKPLACE RETALIATION CLAIMS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. HOWEVER. WHEN THEY DO ESPECIALLY GIVEN ARE DUE TO LACK OF AWARENESS OF THE SHORT STATURE LIMITATIONS. OTHER CLAIMS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE TO BE FILED. FURTHERMORE NEARLY FIFTEEN HUNDRED VIOLATIONS OF LABOR CODE ELEVEN NO TWO POINT FIVE WERE CITED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. THIS VIOLATION IS NOT CURRENTLY ALLOW FOR ATTORNEYS FEES FOR PREVAILING EMPLOYEES. THE BURDEN OF PAYING ATTORNEYS FEES CAN BE A DETERRENT FOR AGREE FOR OCCURS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE LOW WAGE EVEN IF THEY HAVE A STRONG CLAIM. AB TWENTY NINE FORTY SIX PROVIDE EMPLOYEES OF A THREE YEAR PERIOD OF TIME TO FILE RETALIATION CLAIM ALIGNING WITH THE TIME TO FILE A WAGE CLAIM TO LEMONADE. ANY CONFUSION. THE ATTORNEYS BE PROVISIONED PROPELLING APPLY USE ENCOURAGES AND PROTECTS WORKERS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL ACTIONS FOR ABUSIVE VIOLATIONS. WITH ME TO PROVIDE SPORTING TESTIMONIES WAS SILVERTONE FROM THE SAMPLER COUNTY WAGE THAT COALITION I RESPECTFULLY ASK. THANK YOU PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF. OF GUYS THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY WAGE THEFT COALITION THAT I COORDINATE AND THAT SPONSORING AB TWO NINE FOUR SIX. I HAD TALKED TO ABOUT FIFTEEN WORKERS ACT PASSED IF THEY WOULD COME AND TESTIFY THEY'RE PREDOMINANTLY UNDOCUMENTED AND THEY'RE TERRIFIED SO I'M SPEAKING ON THEIR BEHALF AND. HOPEFULLY WILL TELL YOU SOME OF THEIR STORIES I'M THE SUPERVISING ATTORNEY OF THE WORKERS RIGHTS CLINIC AT THE CATHARINE AND GEORGE ALEXANDER COMMUNITY LAW CENTER AT SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW. WE SERVE PREDOMINANTLY LOW WAGE IMMIGRANT WORKERS WE ALSO HOLD WE KEEP WEEKLY CLINICS. DREW DURING ALL THREE LAW SCHOOL SEMESTERS WE PARTNER WITH THE VIETNAMESE BAR TO HOLD MONTHLY KILL CLINICS IN THE FILIPINO BAR. TO HOLD QUARTERLY CLINICS WE'VE ALSO INVESTIGATED RETALIATION KIT CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF THE LABOR COMMISSION. IN THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS THAT I SUPERVISE THE CLINIC WE HAVE REPEATEDLY SEEN WORKERS FIRED FOR ASKING FOR UNPAID WAGES AND WE'VE EVEN SEEN WORKERS ASSAULTED WHEN THEY'VE ASKED FOR WAGES. EMPLOYERS HAVE CONSTANTLY MADE THREATS OF DEPORTATION ONE WORKER SOUGHT UNPAID WAGES TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF EMPLOYERS WHO USE DEPORTATION THREATS TO STEAL WAGES ARE ENGAGE IN UNFAIR IMMIGRATION REAL RETALIATION. THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A B. TWO SIXTY THREE AND A. B. SIX SIXTY SIX IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN. ALTHOUGH THOSE WERE CRITICAL FROM CHANGES UP WE ARE STILL SEEING AN INCREASE IN RETALIATION AND IMMIGRATION RELATED THREATS. ESPECIALLY IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE AND. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA GAVE YOU SOME STATISTICS ABOUT HOW THE NUMBER HAD INCREASED TWENTY TWO PERCENT. AND ACTUALLY. FROM TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE TO SIXTEEN THEY'VE GONE UP. SEVENTY PERCENT IMMIGRATION RELATED CASES HAVE INCREASED MARKEDLY ACCORDING TO A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST BY A SOUTH BAY NEWSPAPER. SOUTH BAY MEANING SAN JOSE SOUTH BAY IMMIGRATION RELATED RETALIATION CLAIMS INCREASED FROM SEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN. TO TWENTY ARE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN AND NINETY FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN WE'VE OBSERVED AT OUR WORKERS RIGHTS CLINIC THAT EMPLOYERS ARE EMBOLDENED IN THIS CURRENT POLITICAL CLIMATE. IN SEVERAL OF OUR CASES THE EMPLOYER LEFT THREATS OF DEPORTATION ON WORKERS VOICE MAIL. WENT TO THE WORKERS HUSBANDS WORKPLACE TO MAKE DEPORTATION THREATS AND THREATS OF LOSS OF HOUSING. MADE REPEATED THREATS OVER THE PHONE EVEN WHEN THIRD PARTY LIKE THE HUSBAND WAS ON THE PHONE AND IN ONE RECENT CASE THREATENED TO HAVE THE CLIENT DEPORTED AND KILLED. AND WE ENDED UP HAVING TO GET A RESTRAINING ORDER IN THAT CASE THE BIGGEST BARRIER TO WORKERS IN FILING THESE CLAIMS IS THE SHORT STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND THE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING REPRESENTATION. TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE THE PROCESS. MOST CLIENTS ARE UNAWARE THAT THE STATUTE IS ONLY SIX MONTHS WE'VE HAD SO MANY CLIENTS COME WHERE IT'S BEEN SEVEN MONTHS EIGHT MONTHS NINE MONTHS OR EVEN A HERE. BECAUSE THEY ASSUME THAT IT'S THREE YEARS JUST LIKE THE WAGE CLAIMS AND THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR RETALIATION FOR A DISCRIMINATE RETALIATION PACE IF YOU'RE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT IS TO GO THROUGH A IS AB ONE YEAR AND AT THE D. O. WELL THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IT'S TWO TO THREE YEARS AND IT'S BEEN FRUSTRATING TO MEET WITH THESE CLIENTS. AFTER THE SIX MONTHS. THOSE OPPOSING THE BILL STATE OF THE WORKER HAS THE OPTION OF GOING TO COURT HOWEVER MOST LAWYERS CAN'T ECONOMICALLY AFFORD TO TAKE CASES TO COURT IF THE PLAINTIFF IS A LOW WAGE WORKER WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF BACK PAY. AND WE HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE SUCCESS IN REFERRING WORKERS TO PRIVATE ATTORNEYS ANOTHER BARRIER IS A LACK OF INCENTIVE FOR THE PRIVATE PARTY TAKE CASES BECAUSE THERE'S NO ATTORNEY FEE PROVISION. THERE'S AN ATTORNEY FEE PROVISION FOR PREVAILING PET PLAINTIFFS IN WAGE IN OUR OUR CASES BUT NOT IN RETALIATION CASES SO IN OTHER WORDS IF YOUR EMPLOYER DOESN'T PAY YOU. YOU YOU DO YOU CAN GO TO COURT AND GET ATTORNEY'S FEES BUT IF YOU COMPLAIN THAT YOU'RE NOT GETTING PAID AND YOU'RE FIRED. THERE'S NO ATTORNEYS FEES ALSO OTHER WHISTLEBLOWER STATUTES AND RETALIATION STATUES HAVE ATTORNEY FEES FOR PREVAILING WAGES FOR EXAMPLE THE CALIFORNIA WHISTLEBLOWER ACT. HAS IT AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING RETALIATION PROVISIONS THEY ALSO HAVE ATTORNEYS FEES. AND THIS BILL WILL NOT ONLY HELP WORKERS FAILING FACING THREATS OF DEPORTATION BUT IT'LL ALSO HOPE WORKERS WHO ARE RETALIATED AGAINST BECAUSE THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT EQUAL PAY. CRITICAL HEALTH AND SAFETY PROBLEMS OR SICK PAY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WORKERS FILE THESE CASES AND THE SHORT STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND LACK OF ATTORNEYS FEES ARE BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO JUSTICE. THANK YOU A DID YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES. I'VE SEEN THAT ANYONE ELSE WHO WISHES TO ADD ON SUPPORT TO THIS BILL. PLEASE COME FORWARD. HEY JULIA PARISH WITH LEGALLY THAT WORK WHERE STATEWIDE NONPROFIT THAT REPRESENTS LOW WAGE WORKERS IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON TO COLLECT A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY WITH WORK SAFE FOR PART OF THE LEGAL AID NETWORK WE ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF WORKERS WITH RESPECT TO HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. MARY CRAZE OF THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS ENOUGH FLOORS WITH THE MAINTENANCE COOPERATION TRUST FUND AND WE ALSO SUPPORT THE QUEUE. BRIAN HOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON IT BUT IB RECOMMEND TO SUPPORT. Q. ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD. COULD WE MAKE A SPACE HERE BUT MAKE A SPACE FOR YOU AND THE TABLE. YEAH AYE GOOD AFTERNOON OR CURTIS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION. TO TWENTY NINE FORTY SIX AM SOMETHING THAT WAS MENTIONED BUT JUST TO CLARIFY PROVE ME RIGHT NOW THROUGH THE JEALOUSY THAT JEALOUSY IS NOT ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY THAN INDIVIDUAL NEEDS TO GO THROUGH IN ORDER TO GET CIVIL COR IT'S KIND OF A CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE THEY CAN I'LL FOR. EITHER FILE WITH THE DLC OR THEY CAN FILE IN CIVIL COURT IN CIVIL COURT YOU DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE M. ATTORNEY'S FEES AND IT'S A MORE LITIGIOUS PROCESS OFTENTIMES PEOPLE CHOOSE TO GO THROUGH THE JEALOUSY PROCESS BECAUSE THEY'RE LOOKING JUST FOR. FOR UNPAID WAGES OR THESE ISSUES AND SO THEY DON'T WANT TO UTILIZE THE CIVIL LITIGATION PROCESS BECAUSE OF THOSE REASONS AND HOWEVER THERE IS NO MAGISTRATE OF REMEDY FOR THEM TO FILE WITH THE JEALOUSY FIRST THEY CAN GO AHEAD AND GO AUTOMATICALLY TO CIVIL COURT IF THAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY. THEY CHOOSE AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY STAND ARE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE EXTENSION OF STEP TWO LIMITATIONS AT THE TOP THIS TIME OUR CONCERN IS THE ATTORNEY'S FEES THE DLC PROCESS. IS A. PROCESS ACTUALLY WALKS THE I'VE I'VE BEEN THROUGH IT WALKS THE INDIVIDUAL THROUGH THE PROCESS THE REPRESENTATIVE OFTENTIMES WILL GIVE THEM THEIR OF THE FAKE GIVE LEGAL ADVICE ASSIST THEM WITH. NEGOTIATING SETTLEMENTS AND ALL OF THOSE ISSUES WHERE AN ATTORNEY NORMALLY COULD HELP OUT IN THOSE SITUATIONS THE AND DILISIO REPRESENTATIVE REALLY DOES WALK THEM THROUGH IT THE EMPLOYER DOES NOT HAVE CONTACT WITH THE INDIVIDUAL ON THESE CONFERENCE CALLS. AND THE INDIVIDUAL MEETS WITH THE JEALOUSY REPRESENTATIVE AND THEN THE INDIVIDUAL MEETS WITH THE EMPLOYER AND THEN THE. REPRESENTATIVE DICK DISCUSSES IT WITH THEM AND AND SO I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU ALL KNOW THAT IT IS A A SEPARATE PROCESS I'M HAS THEIR YOU KNOW THESE WALKED THROUGH THE THE ENTIRE PROCESS. AND AND SO THIS WOULD MAKE AT THE DLC PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN A CALIFORNIA AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION ON THIS MEASURE IN. TWO QUICK THINGS ONE IS. THE EARLIER SUPPORT WITNESS THE. A WE DON'T IN ANY WAY CONDONE RETALIATION AND CERTAINLY THE THREATS OF DEPORTATION ARE ARE PRETTY OUTRAGEOUS SO I DON'T WANT OUR OPPOSITION TO. BE PERCEIVED IN ANYWAY AS CONDONING THAT SORT OF ACTIVITY. ALSO THE. AUTHOR AND STAFF AND HIS STAFF HAVE BEEN VERY GENEROUS WITH THEIR TIME ON THIS MEASURE AS MISS CURTIS INDICATED WE DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS PROVISION. WE THINK THAT THE DEAL S. C. PROCESSES OF IT. VERY EMPLOYER FRIENDLY. IN WITH THE AWARD OF ATTORNEY'S FEES IT'LL TURN IT INTO A MUCH MORE ADVERSARIAL PROCESS. IN LOOKING AT SUBDIVISION J. THAT THE BILL. THERE'S NO DEFINITION OF WHAT IS A SUCCESSFUL ACTION. I DON'T KNOW WHAT DOES THAT MEAN A RECOVERY OF SIMPLY ONE DOLLAR. ALSO I WOULD NOTE THAT IT'S A ONE SIDED ATTORNEY'S FEES IT'S NOT FOR BOTH SIDES WHOEVER MAY PREVAIL. AND IS YOUR ANALYSIS NOTES ON PAGE TWO LAST YEAR. A SENATOR HERTZBERG AUTHORED LEGISLATION THAT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY DID OPPOSE BUT IT GRANTED A FERRET AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL POWERS TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. AS WELL AS TO PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS TO WORKERS AND WE THINK THAT THAT BILL LOT OF. BE ALLOWED TO TAKE A FACT I WOULD ALSO NOTE A SINCE THE A SUPPORT WITNESS WAS FROM. A WAGE THEFT AS WELL THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY NOT ONLY WORKED ON AB TWO SIXTY THREE THAT WAS CITED BUT. TWO YEARS AGO. WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH THE PRO TEM TO SUPPORT S. B. FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT THAT GRANTED EXTENSIVE. ADDITIONAL POWERS TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO DEAL WITH WAGE THEFT I AND WE WOULD PREFER THOSE TYPES OF POWERS TO BE IN THE HANDS OF THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. WE THINK AGAIN THAT THE ATTORNEYS FEES PROVISION WILL INCENTIVIZE. UNNECESSARY LITIGATION AND TURN THAT DEAL AS HE PROCESS INTO MORE OF AN ADVERSARIAL ACTIVITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MIKE BELOW APPEARING TODAY FOR THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA THIS QUESTION OF WHAT A PREVAILING THE USE OF THE REALLY GOOD FOOD PRETTY. IT'S AN OPPOSITE. YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON KELLY HIM SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION AQ. GOOD AFTERNOON MATTHEW ON WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION ALSO OPPOSED. WHAT ELSE ADDING ON IN OPPOSITION SEEING NONE LIKE TRYING TO THE MEMBERS SHOWS THAT? THEY THE ROBO AGREE OF THAT THERE IS MORE TIME YOU DO APPROPRIATELY RECONCILE THESE CASES AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THEM. UP POETICALLY THAT I AS IT APPLIES THE ATTORNEY'S FEES REPAIR MEMBER. THAT. WE CAN TALK ABOUT PREVAILING PARTY WHAT HAVE YOU BUT THERE ISN'T A BALANCE OF POWER WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. THE PARTIES THAT ARE WELL LIKE MOVES OVER TO UP TO THE RIGHT AT ME THAT WORKS FOR NON PROFITS THAT WORKS WITH THAT. IRV OPEN THEM ALL LAW CENTER AND OTHER. PRO BONO TYPE EFFORTS BE ABLE TO HIRE ANOTHER STAFF ATTORNEY CIVIC REPRESENT MORE WORKERS THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT FATTY THE COFFERS OF OF LAWYERS ARE REALLY TALK ABOUT THE ABILITY. FOR THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE A VOICE TO HAVE A VOICE AND BASS WITH HIS ATTORNEY FEES WOULD ALLOW FOR AGAIN ARE ONLY SITUATIONS WHERE THE. A DUMP EMPLOYER A ISD FAULT SO WITH THAT RESPECT THE ASPIRIN YOU THE TWO. HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER PRESENT. THREE BILLS. ONLY THREE ONLY THREE. I ORDERED. WE DO NOT. LET'S START WITH HIM CASE. EACH TWENTY EIGHT FORTY ONE AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY ONE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY ONE ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO USE UP TO FIVE PAID SICK DAYS A YEAR WITHOUT FACING WAGE LOSS OR RETALIATION. AS YOU KNOW FOUR YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA SET A NATIONAL STANDARD BY PROVIDING SIX POINT FIVE MILLION WORKERS WITH THE LONG OVERDUE PROTECTION OF THREE PAID SICK DAYS. WE BECAME THE FIRST. STATE IN THE NATION TO ENSURE THAT EVERY PRIVATE SECTOR WORKER WAS ABLE TO EARN PAID SICK DAYS. SINCE THEN. OTHER STATES IN MAJOR CITIES IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING OAKLAND BERKELEY LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO HAVE PASSED MORE EXPANSIVE LAWS GRANTING WORKERS WITH AT LEAST FIVE DAYS OF SICK LEAVE IF NOT MORE. THIS YEAR IN PARTICULAR FLEA RELATED HOSPITALIZATION MORTALITY RATES HAVE BEEN UNPRECEDENTED THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION REPORTS OF PEOPLE WHO FELL ILL WITH THE FLU NEEDED AT LEAST A WEEK TO RECOVER. FOR WORKING FAMILIES STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT PAID SICK DAYS COULD HAVE COST THEM ON AVERAGE THEIR ENTIRE MONTHLY BUDGET FOR GROCERIES. IT'S TIME THAT WE STRENGTH THAN WHAT WE'VE ALREADY CREATED AND ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE THE ADEQUATE NUMBER OF SICK DAYS A YEAR. AND WE THINK IT'S TIME AFTER SEEING THE OVERWHELMING SUCCESS OF THREE DAYS TO EXPAND THAT TO FIVE LIKE SO MANY OF OUR MUNICIPALITIES HAVE ALREADY DONE. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE A FEW TESTIMONIES FROM. TWO WITNESSES. WHO'S IN CHARGE NOW. I. WE. YEAH I'M SORRY I'M TALKING TO TONY AND HE'S GONE. HEY. MY NAME IS HOLLY DEUS I AM I'M LEADER FOR THE SACRAMENTO PAY FOR FIFTEEN AND UNION RIGHTS. AND I AM ALSO A FAST FOOD WORKER OF THEM AND THEY HAVE A CHILD WHO IS TWO YEARS OLD. M.. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLY WOMAN GONZALEZ. FORUM GETTING THE THREE BASIC PAY FOR US. I'VE HAD TO WORK WITH STREP THROAT BRONCHITIS FOOD POISONING PNEUMONIA. M. MY SON WAS REALLY SICK AS A BABY. AND THERE WERE DAYS THAT HE WAS CRYING IN PAIN AND INSTEAD OF BEING THE MOTHER THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN I HAVE TO GO TO WORK BECAUSE IF I MISS ONE DAY A WORK. TO BE A MOTHER THAT'S LATE. A LOT OF MONEY. THAT WERE MISSING SO HURRY BEGIN EMOTIONAL SORRY. AND IT'S REALLY HARD WHEN. YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN WORKING AND BEING A MOTHER I GREW UP WITHOUT A MOTHER AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILD TO MISS OUT. AND SO I KNOW THE STRUGGLES. THE. MY FATHER WENT THROUGH YOU KNOW. AND I'M REALLY HOPING THAT. WE CAN GET THE EMBRACE TO FIVE DAYS BECAUSE. THE FLU SEASON THIS YEAR KILLED A LOT OF PEOPLE. BECAUSE THEY WERE HAVING TO GO TO WORK IF THEY WERE ABLE TO GET PAID TO TAKE TIME OFF WORK THEY WOULD GET THE ADEQUATE MEDICAL ATTENTION THAT THEY WOULD NEED AND THEY WOULD STILL BE HERE WITH US TODAY. THINK. MY NAME IS DONNA LEVITT. BEFORE RETIRING TO YEARS AGO I HEADED THE SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT. WHICH ENFORCES THE COUNTRY'S FIRST PAID SICK LEAVE ORDINANCE. I'M TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY ONE BECAUSE I BELIEVE BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE. THAT AN INCREASE OF THE MINIMUM A CRUEL CAP FROM THREE TO FIVE DAYS IS A MODEST AND MUCH NEEDED IMPROVEMENT TO THE CALIFORNIA LAW. A MINIMUM OF CRUEL CAP OF FORTY HOURS IS NOW STANDARD FOR CITY AND STATE LAWS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE SAN FRANCISCO LAW HAS PROVIDED FOR IN A CRUEL CAP OF SEVENTY TWO HOURS FOR EMPLOYERS WITH TEN OR MORE EMPLOYEES. AND FORTY HOURS FOR SMALLER BUSINESSES. ALTHOUGH EACH STATE LAW IS DIFFERENT PAID SICK LEAVE LAWS IN CONNECTICUT MASSACHUSETTS OREGON ARIZONA AND MARYLAND ALL HAVE PROVISIONS FOR MINIMUM CAPS OF FORTY HOURS PER YEAR. LAWS IMPLEMENTED THIS YEAR IN VERMONT AND RHODE ISLAND WILL PHASE UP TO FORTY HOURS IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEENIN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY RESPECTIVELY. AND THE STATE OF WASHINGTON DOES NOT ALLOW EMPLOYERS TO CAP APPROVALS AT ALL. CALIFORNIA'S LAW IS A LIFE CHANGER FOR LOW INCOME EMPLOYEES BUT IN TOO MANY SITUATIONS WORKERS STILL CAN'T AFFORD TO STAY HOME WHEN THEY ARE SICK OR NEED TO CARE FOR A SICK FAMILY MEMBER. PLEASE SUPPORT AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY ONE TO AMEND THE LAW TO BETTER NEED MEET THE NEEDS OF WORKING FAMILIES. AS YOU KNOW PAID SICK LEAVE IS GOOD PUBLIC POLICY. IT'S GOOD FOR EMPLOYEES FOR EMPLOYERS AND FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESS IN SUPPORT. DEAN SMITH CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP AND MYSTIC VIOLENCE IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY CA DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. MICHELLE POCKET WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. ANGELIQUE WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MICHAEL MCLAUGHLIN AND EIGHTY RPG VOLUNTEER AND WITH THE CAPITAL RESPONSE TEAM.

TAYLOR JACKSON AT THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION AND STRONG SUPPORT. TIM RYAN WITH UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS WESTERN STATES COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. ANYONE ELSE OUTSIDE IN SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION SO MORNING OR AFTERNOON I THINK NOW I'LL LARA CURTIS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND AYE OBVIOUSLY WE ARE SYMPATHETIC TO THE WITNESSES THAT AND DISCUSS THEIR ISSUES TODAY SO WE AND DO APPRECIATE THEM COMING TO THESE. HEARINGS BUT. AT THIS POINT WE ARE ON OPPOSED TO THIS BILL BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT IT IS TOO AND TO MUCH TOO SOON THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES WITH THE PAID SICK LEAVE. ORDINANCE AS IT STANDS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN ADDRESSED. FOR EXAMPLE THEIR NOTICE AND VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER LOCAL ORDINANCES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS FOR EXAMPLE SAN DIEGO ALLOWS YOU TO VERIFY SICK LEAVE AFTER THREE DAYS IS TAKEN. WHILE THAT AND CITY ALLOWS FOR FIVE DAYS OF SICK LEAVE IF THREE DAYS OF TAKEN THE EMPLOYER CAN THEN VERIFY WHETHER OR NOT I'M WITH IT YOU WITH SOME SORT VERIFICATION FROM THE EMPLOYEE. THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT ADDITIONALLY AND THERE ARE IN THE BILL IT SAYS THAT YOU ARE UP TO THREE DAYS OR TWENTY FOUR HOURS WHILE THE FAQS ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING. HAS STATED THAT IT IS WHATEVER IS IN BETTER INTEREST OF THE EMPLOYEE THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY IN THE STATUE AND SO WE WOULD LIKE THOSE ISSUES. DISCUSSED AND THEN OTHER DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS RATE OF PAY THINGS LIKE THAT THAT ARE ACTUALLY DISCUSSED IN THE CURRENT STATUTE THAT NEEDS IN CLARIFYING LANGUAGE AND AND. THEM ADDITIONALLY CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY RECOGNIZED AS BY THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATORS ONE MOST FAMILY FRIENDLY STATES AND AND THERE ARE ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW FOR AND TIME OFF SUCH AS A FAMILY SIT FRONT ALTHOUGH IS EITHER. AND AREAS SO THAT'S OUR IF WE ARE TO OPPOSITION AS OF NOW AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME TODAY THANK YOU. SIR TURN MEMBERS MIGHT BELOW APPEARING FOR THE. CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAW COUNCIL AND THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA I. WANT TO SAY THAT I DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE IN DEPTH WITH MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER WHEN THE FIRST ATOM. OF LAW WAS ENACTED AND SHE WAS REMARKABLY. OPEN CALIFORNIA LAW YESTERDAY I GOT A CALL FROM A HAIR SALON OWNER WHO'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT HE WILL? STYLISTS IF A BASED ON COMMISSION PAY OR PEACE THREE RATE PAY. UP UNDER THE SAN FRANCISCO ORDINANCE AND UNDER THE CALIFORNIA LAW AND HOW THEY'RE DIFFERENT AND HOW THEY INTER RELATE AND IT IS MIND NUMBINGLY COMPLICATED. AND HEAVEN HELP THE PERSON WHO HASTERT. DO BUSINESS IN MULTIPLE CITIES WITH DIFFERENT ORDINANCES AND COMPLY WITH CALIFORNIA LAW SO WE WOULD ARGUE THAT AT AT LEAST IT'S TIME TO HAVE A UNIFORM STANDARD IN CALIFORNIA THAT BUSINESSES CAN RELY ON. AND MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES DO OPERATE IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE. MULTIPLE ORDINANCES AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THEY'RE PULLING THEIR HAIR OUT THIS IS A VERY VERY COMPLICATED. THING AND WE'D LIKE A SIMPLE RULE THAT PEOPLE COULD UNDERSTAND AND I REPRESENT BIG EMPLOYERS WHO HAVE ARMIES OF LAWYERS TO DO IT. PITY THE POOR SMALL BUSINESS WHO HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT ON THEIR OWN OR COUNT ON A ON A PAYROLL COMPANY TO DO IT FOR THEM. SO THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT IN THE WORLD MOST OF OUR COMPANIES PROVIDE MORE THAN THAT THREE DAYS BUT SOMETHING OUGHT TO BE DONE ABOUT UNIFORMITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION. FAITH BRING BORDERS ON BEHALF OF THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE WOULD ALIGN OUR COMMENTS BUT DOESN'T MISTER BELOW THANK YOU. TRUE TO HIS OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF FOOD PRODUCERS IN OPPOSITION. KATIE HANSON CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. MATTHEW ON WESTERN GROWERS ALSO OPPOSE. ANY MERKLEY CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU POST. ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. PROJECT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. TO THE AUTHOR WOULD WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS THE COMMENTARY. ABOUT HOW. YOU KNOW CONSISTENCY ACROSS JURISDICTIONS IN WHAT EIGHT EMPLOYERS CAN REASONABLY EXPECT TO KNOW WHAT THEIR OBLIGATIONS ARE. WELL I THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING AS FAR AS CONSISTENCY RIGHT WHEN AND I DO RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THAT IF YOU ARE RUNNING A BUSINESS IN MULTIPLE CITIES WITH DIFFERENT. AT PAPERWORK REQUIREMENTS. ACCRUAL RATES THAT IT IS DIFFICULT IT'S DIFFICULT TODAY IT WOULD REMAIN DIFFICULT IF EXTENDED TO FIVE DAYS FROM THE STATE. I THINK IT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO ACCEPT THAT FIVE DAYS IS A BETTER STANDARD TO UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE ASKING FIVE DAYS IN THE COME IN AND SEE IF WE CAN TALK ABOUT STREAMLINING BETWEEN THE STATE. AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SOME OF. SOME OF THOSE INCONSISTENCIES WE HAVEN'T HAD WE'VE HAD SOME WE'VE HAD ONE CLEAN UP BILL ALREADY. BUT I WOULD LOVE A TO INVITE THEM INTO THAT DISCUSSION KNOWING THAT WHAT THIS BILL DOES TODAY IS JUST EXPAND THE NUMBER OF DAYS. AVAILABLE TO WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA A RIGHT THAT RT EXIST UNDER LAW FOR THREE DAYS I'M SEMI OF OUR JURISDICTIONS IN AND. PROBABLY MAJORITY OF WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA FALL UNDER A HIGHER STANDARD ARE READY AND BUT IT DOES PROVIDE THEM A GREAT OPPORTUNITY COME IN AND SAY EXACTLY. WHAT CHANGES AT AND I WANNA BE REALLY CLEAR NOT CHANGES IN PREEMPTING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE? EVEN MORE DAYS LIKE SAN FRANCISCO WE HAVE NO INTEREST IN. TELLING A LOCAL JURISDICTION THAT THEY PROVIDE TOO MANY DAYS WE THINK THAT'S UP TO THOSE LOCAL AREAS TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND THIS EVEN FURTHER. BUT WE'D BE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH BUSINESS AND TO A. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO FIND OUT IF WE CAN'T STREAMLINED SOME OF. THAT WHAT THEY ARE SEEN AS INCONSISTENCIES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THOSE BUSINESS GROUPS THANK YOU SIDE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEN THEM THERE IS A MOTION AND A SECOND. WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS. NOW I I I I THINK I I I THINK MR PHILIP PACK FOR HIS COMMENTS BECAUSE I WAS VERY HONEST WHEN WE GET THREE DAYS AND WE DID IT FOR A REASON I WANT TO REMIND FOLKS. WE BECAME THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO NOT LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND ON WE EVENTUALLY A IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WE EVENTUALLY CAUGHT UP OUR PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES ARE IHS THAT'S WORKERS WITH. WITH ARROW WE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE WEEK WE PUT OUR SICK DAYS INTO THAT SO WE ARE THE ONLY STATE THAT DIDN'T EXEMPT ANY EMPLOYEES AND HAVE A A. CLEAR STANDARD ACROSS THE BOARD THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS TO RAISE THAT UP JUST A LITTLE BIT WE ARE CLEAR THAT WE WANTED TO DO THAT WE STARTED WITH THREE SO THAT WE COULD GET. A MINIMUM STANDARD AND WE KNEW WHERE WE WERE VERY HONEST WITH PEOPLE THAT WE ARE COMING BACK IT'S A GREAT TIME TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT WE NEED CLARIFIED IT IT'S IT'S A OPPORTUNITY FOR BUSINESS TO COME IN AND BE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND NOT JUST FIGHT. I WANNA. ALSO THEY THEY DIDN'T BRING UP SOME VERY EXCITED TO HEAR THAT IT'S NOT BEING CALLED A JOB KILLER. BE ACCUSED OF THAT BECAUSE AFTER WHAT'S CALLED A JOB KILLER AFTER THREE DAYS WE'VE SHOWN THAT ACTUAL PRODUCTIVITY. AND ON THE JOB NUMBERS HAVE GONE UP IN CALIFORNIA FOR A PASTOR ARE MANDATORY SICKLY POLICIES AND SO. I THINK THAT THIS IS A JOB CREATOR BILL AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY OF OUR WORKERS SO I'M GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE ON TRANSITION TO ANY DISCUSSION. THANK YOU THIS BILL DOES HAVE AN AYE RECOMMENDATION PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS THURMOND AYE THURMAN AYE FLORA. FLORA NO GONZALEZ FLETCHER I HAVE GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE JONES SAWYER AYE JONES SAWYER AYE KALRA. KALRA I. MCCARTY MELENDEZ. MELENDEZ NO. THAT BILL IS OUT ARE YOU READY FOR THIS AT YOUR NEXT BILL FOR. I WILL AND. TWO A. B. TWO FOUR NINE SIX PRESUMPTION OF EMPLOYMENT TWO FOUR NINE SIX. WE'RE READY WHEN YOU ARE THINKING CALIFORNIA TRACKS A HIGH RATE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING DUE TO THE STRONG ECONOMY LARGE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES IN OUR PROXIMITY TO U. S. MEXICO BORDER. TWENTY TWELVE STUDY CONDUCTED BY SENIOR STATE UNIVERSITY FOUND THAT RATES OF LABOR TRAFFICKING OF IMMIGRANT WORKERS IN THE PROPERTY SERVICE INDUSTRY WERE AMONG THE HIGHEST OF ANY INDUSTRY. DESPITE EFFORTS TO CURTAIL ABUSE AGAINST PROPERTY SERVICE WORKERS ESPECIALLY JANITORS IT'S WELL DOCUMENTED NUMEROUS UNSCRUPULOUS BUSINESS PREY ON MIGRANT WORKERS FOR THIS INDUSTRY BY OFFERING THEM LONG HOURS WITH LITTLE TO NO PAY. THESE JANITORS MANY OF WHOM ARE TRAFFICKED TO THIS COUNTRY ILLEGALLY ARE ALSO COURSE INTO INDENTURED LABOR ENTRAPPED IN JOBS WHICH EMPLOYERS HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER MOST ASPECTS OF THEIR LIFE. LABOR TRAFFICKERS LURE WORKERS BY MAKING FALSE PROMISES OFFERING HIGH PAY EDUCATION TRAVEL OPPORTUNITIES AND ONCE THE WORKER GREECE A JOB THERE INSTEAD AGREED WITH LIES AND HERBAL TREATMENT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEN IS A MESS CLASSIFICATION OF THESE WORKERS THIS MESS CLASSIFICATION PREVENTS EMPLOYERS FROM BEING HELD RESPONSIBLE TO PAY OVERTIME WORKERS COMPENSATION OR NUMBER OF OTHER BENEFITS. IN NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN THE LABOR CODE SECTION TWO SEVEN FIVE ZERO POINT FIVE WASN'T ACTED TO ENSURE THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WERE NOT MISS. CLASSIFIED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OVER EIGHTY YEARS LATER A. B. TWO FOUR NINE SIX WOULD PROVIDE JANITORS AND ALL PROPERTY SERVICE WORKERS THOSE SAME PROTECTIONS A PRESUMPTION OF BEING EMPLOYEES. WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IS. DAN REYES MEN. FROM THE THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN AND NOW FLOOR IS FROM THE MAINTENANCE CORPORATION TRUST ON. TWO OF THE FIRST WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS. I'M DAN REISMAN I MAY DIP YOU JUST RETURNING WITH ALAMEDA COUNTY I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF ALAMEDA COUNTY NANCY O'MALLEY WHO IS THE SPONSOR THIS BILL. I HAVE MY OWN EXPERIENCE I IN THE OFFICE PROSECUTING WORKER'S COMP FRAUD AND LABOR ABUSES BOB FROM A CRIMINAL PERSPECTIVE AND AND WHAT. I KNOW AND I THINK EVERY WORKERS COMP. FRAUD PROSECUTOR KNOWS IS THAT IT OF THE BIG TOOL THAT'S USED IN INVESTIGATIONS OF WORKPLACE ABUSES. ESPECIALLY IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IS THE EXISTING REGIME OF THE PRESUMPTION THAT AN UNLICENSED. SUBCONTRACTORS CONSIDERED AN EMPLOYEE. AND WE WE USE IN THAT IN THAT. CONTEXT WE USE THAT PRESUMPTION TO CREATE WORKERS COMP FRAUD PROSECUTIONS AND AND PAYROLL TAX FRAUD PROSECUTIONS. THE STUDY IN TWENTY TWELVE FROM SAN DIEGO FOUND THAT. THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY. CRIED EVEN MORE INCIDENTS MORE HIGHER RATES OF OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND LABOR EXPLOITATION THEN DID THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IT'S CLOSE BUT IT HAS EVEN MORE AND. AND IT MAKES SENSE FROM WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT LABOR TRAFFICKING AND LABOR EXPLOITATION THAT THAT DARKNESS LACK OF HUMAN CONTACT LACK OF REGULATION IS WHAT. IS WHAT ENCOURAGES THE KINDS OF ABUSES THAT WE SEE IN THOSE INDUSTRIES WE HAVE THIS PRESUMPTION IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IT WORKS VERY WELL TO BRING ATTENTION. NOT JUST FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IN THE CSL BE. AS THAT NINETEEN SEVENTY AB NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT BILL. BRINGS IN THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE PRESUMPTION WE ADD ON ATTENTION FROM. FEED. INSURANCE FRAUD DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE THE. PAYROLL TAX FRAUD DIVISION OF THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT AND ALSO THE ACTUAL WORKERS COMP COMPANIES THEMSELVES WHO NOW ARE GOING TO POLICE THEIR OWN. CLIENTS FOR. FOR FRAUD IN FOR ABUSES AND AND GIVE A REMEDY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WORK WHO ARE INJURED ON THE JOB. WHERE THERE'S IN THE GENERAL INDUSTRY? LIKE THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY SOME COMPLEX. SUBCONTRACTING RELATIONSHIPS UP THE CHAIN OF OF EMPLOYERS. SO FOR THOSE REASONS THE. I. ASK ALL OF YOU TO TO VOTE I THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY. USEFUL FROM EMPLOYMENT FOR IT FROM A POINT PROSECUTION PERSPECTIVE WHERE THERE'S TO PLEASE WORKPLACE ABUSES BUT ALSO TO EXPOSE THE SEVERE EXPLOITATION THAT HAPPENS IN THE DARKNESS IN THESE. LOW WAGE JOBS IN THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ENOUGH FLOOR AS AN ON THE LEGAL DIRECTOR WITH THE MAINTENANCE COOPERATION TRUST FUND FOR A STATEWIDE JANITORIAL WATCHDOG GROUP THAT WAS ORGANIZED BY A RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYERS WHO ARE OUTBID BY LAW BREAKING COMPANIES. AND OUR MISSION IS TO SYSTEMATICALLY ELIMINATE UNFAIR COMPETITION THE JUDGE OIL INDUSTRY WE PARTNER WITH VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES AND DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES TO BRING ABOUT COMPLAINTS IN THE INDUSTRY. AND THIS WORK IS OFTEN COMPLICATED BY CHARACTERISTICS FOUND IN THE INFORMAL UNDERGROUND ECONOMY SOME OF THOSE CHARACTERISTICS ARE NOT HAVING ESTABLISH OFFICE PLAYING SHALL GAINS WITH THE LEGAL ENTITIES TO HIDE THEIR TRUE IDENTITY HIDING ASSETS LACK OF PAYROLL RECORDS CASH PAY. AND MISS CLASSIFYING WORKERS OF THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND THIS GIVES EMPLOYERS IN THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY THE UPPER HAND OVER LAW ABIDING EMPLOYER'S. AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY SIX PROVIDES JANITORS THE SAME PROTECTION OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WERE MISS CLASSIFICATION IS RAMPANT IN THIS IS NECESSARY FOR THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY. AND WITH CLASSIFICATION DOESN'T JUST HURT BUSINESSES AND WORKERS BUT IS ALSO HURTS THE STATE I MOST OFTEN THE STATE LOSES OUT ON TAX PREMIUMS. AND ALSO PAY THE BILL FOR UNINSURED WORKERS THAT ARE INJURED ON THE JOB. FOR EXAMPLE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY THE OWNER OF GOOD NEIGHBOR SERVICES PLED GUILTY TO FELONY TAX EVASION A WORKERS COMP FRAUD. JANET SMITH CLASSIFIED OVER A HUNDRED JANITORIAL WORKERS. AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS TO AVOID PAYING TAXES WORKERS COMP PREMIUM FRAUD. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THIS FRAUD IN THE CASE TOTALED SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND ALSO WORKERS WERE LEFT WITH BUT WITHOUT ANY COVERAGE FOR WHEN THEY WERE INJURED ON THE JOB. AND THERE ARE MANY EMPLOYERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH THE SAME PRACTICE AND SEE GETTING CAUGHT AS JUST THE PRICE OF DOING BUSINESS WE CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH AGENCIES ON THE TYPES OF CASES. BUT WE STILL HAVE NOT FIXED THE PROBLEM EMPLOYERS WILL CONTINUE TO MISS COST BY WORKERS AND THAT IS WHY AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY SIX THE SO CRITICAL TO THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY. WILL PUT THE ONUS ON EMPLOYERS TO SHOW THAT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ARE LEGITIMATE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. AND THIS IS NECESSARY IN AN INDUSTRY WHERE MISS CLASSIFICATION IS RAMPANT IT RESULTS IN WORKERS BEING ROBBED OF BASIC WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS LIKE MINIMUM WAGE OVERTIME ANTI DISCRIMINATION AND WORKERS COMPENSATION WHEN THEY'RE INJURED. MISS CLASSIFY WORKERS FACE A REAL FEAR WHEN YOU ARE LOW WAGE WORKER AND YOU LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK TO SUPPORT YOUR FAMILY. FINAL WAGE CLAIM FOR BEING MISCLASSIFIED MINT MEANS RISKING YOUR JOB EXERCISING WORKPLACE RIGHT TO SIMPLY NOT AN OPTION FOR TOO MANY WORKERS AND THIS ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO CONTINUE THE PRACTICE OF MISS CLASSIFICATION IN THE INDUSTRY. WE NEED TO SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT IN THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY EMPLOYERS THAT BREAK THE LAW BY MISCLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES WILL NOT BE PROTECTED LAW ABIDING COMPANIES NEED A FAIR MARKETPLACE WERE FOLLOWING THE LAW IS A FLOOR NOT THE FEELING. AS IMPORTANTLY WORKERS NEED THEIR RIGHTS TO BE RESPECTED BOTH OF THESE ELEMENTS ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO REGAIN A LAWFUL ORDER IN THE INDUSTRY. AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY SIX WILL HELP ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS AND FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST ARRIVAL ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANYONE WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN EDUARDO SL YOU CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MARY CHRIS WITH THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. NICOLE MARQUEZ WITH WORK SAFE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. BIRTH SILVER TAUPE SANTA CLARA COUNTY WHICH HAVE COALITION IN SUPPORT. YOU IS THERE ANYONE OUTSIDE THE DOOR WHOSE. WISHING THAT ON.

THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON. LET THE RECORD REFLECT THEY WERE HERE TO ADD ON. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. I SEE NONE RETURNED TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. THERE'S A MOTION. I'LL SECOND THERE IS A SECOND MOTION AND A SECOND. I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. THAT'S WHEN I ABOUT. BUT HOW THIS BILL HAS AN AYE RECOMMENDATION PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO JUDICIARY THURMAN AYE AYE THURMAN AYE FLORA GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE JONES SAWYER. KALRA. KALRA AYE MCCARTY MELINDA'S. MELINDA'S I. THE BILL IS OUT CONGRATULATIONS. AND THE REMAINING BILL AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY TWO. MY EASY WEEK. BRINGING THE FIRE NEXT WEEK. HEY. WARNING OF. I DO NOT TRACING. HAY CON. IRATE. AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN TWENTY SIXTEEN A SAN DIEGO BASED COUPLE WAS ARRESTED FOR ENSLAVING AN INDONESIAN DOMESTIC WORKER IN THEIR HOME. FORCING HER TO WORK BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND EIGHTEEN HOURS A DAY WITHNO PAY AND NO DAYS OFF. THE VIEWS THE VICTIM MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY BY RETAINING HER PASSPORT MAKING HER BELIEVE THAT SHE WOULD BE PHYSICALLY HARMED IF YOU DO NOT PERFORM HER DUTIES. IN ANOTHER RECENT CASE IN ORANGE COUNTY A WOMAN WAS ARRESTED FOR KEEPING FIVE WOMEN ONE FROM KENYA AND FOR FROM THE PHILIPPINES AS SLAVES FOR HER FAMILY. TWENTY FOURTEEN URBAN INSTITUTE STUDY THAT MANY VICTIMS OF LABOR TRAFFICKING WERE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STE CALLED TACTICS. TO CONTROL IMMENSELY VICTIMS INCLUDING THE USE OF DOCUMENT SERVITUDE. DOCUMENT SERVITUDE IS A PRACTICE OF AN EMPLOYER WITHHOLDING AND IMMIGRANTS LEGAL DOCUMENTS FOR PURPOSES OF AND MANIPULATING THE EMPLOYEE. WITH THE VAST MAJORITY OF LABOR TRAFFICKING VICTIMS BEEN IMMIGRANTS IT IS VITAL THAT THE CALIFORNIA PROTECT THESE WORKERS BY PREVENTING UNSCRUPULOUS EMPLOYERS FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY TWO HELPS PROTECT WORKERS AGAINST THE MORAL. OR IMMORAL PRACTICE OF DOCUMENT SERVITUDE BY FIRST PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK TO HOLD THE PLAYERS ACCOUNTABLE WHO ENGAGE IN DOCUMENT SERVITUDE AND DETERMINING A VIOLATION AS A MISDEMEANOR AND POTENTIAL OF UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS CIVIL PENALTY. IT ALSO ESTABLISHES A WORKERS BILL OF RIGHTS IN WHICH THE EMPLOYER MUST PROVIDE A COPY TO EVERY WORKER. AS OUTLINED A PAGE TO THE NOW SINCE I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND STAKEHOLDERS TO FURTHER CLARIFY EXACTLY WHICH EMPLOYERS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS BILL. BECAUSE UNLIKE MOST THE BILLS WE DO THIS IS A PROBLEM AND SMALLER EMPLOYMENT SITUATIONS NOT WITH LARGE COMPANIES. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY. IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY TWO IS MARY ARAB AL AND BEAR IT WITH THIS ANY OF COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. THURMOND AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS. SHE SAID I'M VERY OWN VERTAMAE DE PDA FROM THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO. OF THE CBO COUNTY DA SUMMER STEPHAN IS THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL AND I'M HERE ON HER BEHALF. I AM THE TEAM LEADER IN OUR OFFICE FOR. HUMAN TRAFFICKING I'M A SOUND TO THE SAN DIEGO HUMAN TRAFFICKING TASK FORCE AND I'M CURRENTLY THE CHAIR OF THE ADVISORY COUNCIL OF SAN DIEGO ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND CRUCIAL SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN. IN MY TIME WITH HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES I'VE SEEN THAT THESE VICTIMS OFTEN HIDE IN THE SHADOWS THEY LIVE IN THE SHADOWS. I TOO HAVE SEEN TRAFFICKERS WHO WITHHOLD DOCUMENTS ALLOW THEM TO EXPIRE AND THEN HOLD IMMIGRATION STATUS OVER THE HEADS OF THEIR VICTIMS. IN SPEAKING WITH SURVIVORS AND VICTIMS ESPECIALLY IMMIGRANTS I HAVE FOUND THAT THEY OFTEN DO NOT KNOW OUR SYSTEM. OUR LAWS HOW WE ENFORCE OUR LAWS WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE OR EVEN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE FOR THEM RIGHTS. PA AS NOT NEED OF CITIZENS. THEY ARE OFTEN THEN MANIPULATED FIVE TRAFFICKER WHO EXPLAINS OUR SYSTEM TO THEM FOR HIS OR HER ADVANTAGE. FOR EXAMPLE THE TRAFFICKER SAYS. THE DOCUMENTS FOR SAFE KEEPING AND THEN INFORMS THE VICTIM YOU CANNOT GO OUTSIDE INTO PUBLIC WITHOUT YOUR DOCUMENTS. WE KNOW THAT'S FALSE THE VICTIMS DO NOT. IN ANOTHER ONE THE THREAT WAS YEAH HE'LL BE DEPORTED. BUT YOUR CHILDREN STAY IN THE UNITED STATES THE GOVERNMENT WILL KEEP YOUR CHILDREN HERE. IF YOU DON'T GO ALONG WITH WHAT I DO. THIS ALLOWS THE TRAFFICKER TO FURTHER ISOLATE CONTROL THE VICTIMS. WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE JUST ICING. IN THAT SEVENTY ONE PERCENT OF THE VICTIMS OF COME IN UNLAWFUL VISAS. AND THE BY THE TIME THEY ESCAPE SIXTY NINE PERCENT ARE NO LONGER AUTHORIZED. THIS BILL WILL SHINE A LIGHT FOR ALL WORKERS ON THE LIES OF TRAFFICKERS THAT WILL PROVIDE A TOOL TO EDUCATE OUR WORKERS ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS AND TO PROTECT THEM AGAINST THOSE EMPLOYERS. WHO WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM? IT'S ALSO A TOOL TO HOLD THOSE OFFENDING EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTABLE TO HELP STOP THIS CRIME. AND AGAIN CBO COUNTY DA SUMMER STEP IN IS THE SPONSOR THIS BILL AND WE ARE JUST SUPPORT AND I VOTE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT.

READY FOR HIM TO PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY SIX. WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE. SIXTY SIX TODAY IN IT ANNA. TIME IN WHICH THE MEAT TO MOVEMENT HAS TAKEN CENTER STAGE IT'S BECOME CLEAR THAT WE MUST DO MORE. PROTECT SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE. CALIFORNIA. NEEDS TO SET THE BAR HIGHER AND CANNED EXTENDING EMPLOYMENT PROTECTIONS TO SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE IS A COMMON SENSE MUCH NEEDED NEXT STEP TO ENSURING. A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. FOR ALL AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY SIX WOULD GIVE SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE ABILITY TO ACCESS JOB PROTECTED LEAVE ALREADY AVAILABLE FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT. OR STOCKING ADDITIONALLY THE BILL WOULD ALLOW FAMILY MEMBERS TO ACCESS THE SAME PROTECTIONS IF A LOVED ONE HAS EXPERIENCED SEXUAL ASSAULT SEXUAL HARASSMENT STALKING. AND OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SO THAT THEY CAN HELP THEIR FAMILY MEMBER TO ACCESS CRITICAL. SERVICES THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR SURVIVORS WHO ARE MINORS AND MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION OR WHO NEED SUPPORT. GOING TO A COURT HEARING. TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT CREATE ADDITIONAL PAID TIME OFF BUT SIMPLY SAYS THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT SURVIVORS AND IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS CAN CLAIM PAID TIME OFF. I ALREADY OFFERED TO THEM BY THE EMPLOYER OR TAKE UNPAID TIME. DEAL WITH THE TRAUMA THEY HAVE ENTERED. THERE OUR EMPLOYER SAFEGUARD VERIFICATIONS IN THIS BILL AND WHICH A SURVIVOR AND THEIR IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBER MUST PROVIDE PROOF. OF THEIR ABSENCE SUCH AS A POLICE REPORT AYE DOCTORS ARE COUNSELORS NOTE A COURT ORDER OR COURT DOCUMENT. WE'VE HEARD THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THIS COMMITTEE AND WILL WORK WITH THE NEXT COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO AMEND THE BILL TO DEAL WITH AT THE COMMITTEE'S CONCERNS RAISED HERE AND. IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIANS LEAD THE WAY FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT SURVIVORS AND THEIR LOVED ONES TO ENSURE THEY ARE SUPPORTED. IN THEIR TIME OF NEED I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY THREE SIX. THANK YOU READY FOR YOUR FIRST WITNESS. YES I HAVE. WITNESSES YA JULIA PARISH STAFF ATTORNEY WITH LEGAL AID AT WORK AND CHRISTINE SMITH PUBLIC POLICY COORDINATOR CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO AND. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. CHAIRMAN THURMOND AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HEARING MY TESTIMONY TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY SIX. MY NAME IS CHRISTINE MATH BUT THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIPS AND INVESTED VIOLENCE SUPPORTER OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL. THE PARTNERSHIP IS A STATEWIDE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COALITION REPRESENTING TWO HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS SERVING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S HEALTH SURVEY APPROXIMATELY FORTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA WOMEN EXPERIENCE PHYSICAL INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE IN THEIR LIFETIMES. A STUDY DONE BY LEGAL AID AT WORK FOUND THAT NEARLY FORTY PERCENT OF SURVIVORS IN CALIFORNIA REPORTED EITHER BEING FIRED OR FEAR TERMINATION DUE TO. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THE PREVALENCE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND STALKING IN THE UNITED STATES AND SPECIFICALLY CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE OF HARMFUL EFFECT ON THE ABILITY OF SURVIVORS TO MAINTAIN EMPLOYMENT AND FAMILIES TO MAINTAIN ECONOMIC STABILITY. A SURVIVOR FROM THE BAY AREA ASKED ME TO SHARE HER STORY WITH YOU. AT THE AGE OF NINETEEN SHOES PHYSICALLY ABUSED STOPPED AND HARASSED BY HER EX PARTNER. HERE TO HEAR HER WORKPLACE AND HARASS OUR FRIENDS. HER THERAPIST RECOMMENDED A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER BUT IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HER SIBLINGS AND HER FRIENDS HAD EVEN HEARD OF RESTRAINING ORDER. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY LEARN ABOUT IN SCHOOL OR EVEN FROM HEIR PARENTS BUT THOUGH HER SIBLINGS WERE UNSURE OF HOW TO HELP. THEY'RE WILLING TO OFFER ANY SUPPORT SHE NEEDED. RESTRAINING ORDER FORM WAS TRAUMATIZED THEME SHOULD NEVER BEEN IN COURT BEFORE AND COMBINED BE SEEN HER EXIT NEEDS ARE GONE SHOES FILLED WITH FEAR AND ANXIETY. ON THAT DAY THOUGH PERSON LEANS ATTENDED COURT WITH HER. BECAUSE OF THEIR PHYSICAL PRESENCE SHE DIDN'T FEEL ALONE AND SHE FELL IN POWER TO SPEAK BEFORE THE JUDGE. THE JUDGE GRANTED HER THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER AND SHE BELIEVES THAT THIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT HER SIBLINGS EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. HOWEVER FOR MANY SURVIVORS WHO BENEFIT FROM THE SUPPORT OF A FAMILY MEMBER ATTENDING CORPS OR OTHER APPOINTMENTS WITH THEM. THOSE SEEMLY MEMBERS ARE CURRENTLY UNABLE TO TAKE TIME OFF OF WORK AND BASS BARRIERS TO SUPPORTING THE SURVIVORS THAT THEY CARE ABOUT. POP SCENE AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY SIX WORLD OPTIMALLY MEMBERS ACCESS JOB PROTECTION BELIEVE AND ACCOMMODATIONS TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS. SEEKING RELIEF PERTAINING% SERVICES AND COUNSELING WHERE CROSS LEADER WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE THING KILL AND. MY NAME IS JULIE PARRISH M. INTERNET LEGALLY THAT WORK WHICH IS A STATEWIDE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT ADVOCATES ON BEHALF OF LOW WAGE WORKERS AND THINK YOU AND. SO IN OUR BONTA AND ON THAT COMMITTEE FOR HEARING THIS BILL TODAY. I THINK ONE OF THE MAIN GOALS AND PURPOSES THAT THIS BILL CAN ACCOMPLISH IS TO HELP BREAK THE SILENCE THAT WE SEE. AMONG SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL ASSAULT THERE'S A SIMILAR SORT OF STIGMA AND DIFFICULTY FOR PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD AND SEEK AND ACCESS THE SERVICES WE NEED AND WE NEED TO JUST MAKE THAT AS EASY FOR THEM AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT FEARING. OTHER SORTS OF NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. LIKE LOSING YOUR JOB OR. AND YOU KNOW NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE YOUR SISTER COME WITH YOU AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT MOMENT IN YOUR LIFE AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL REALLY HARMONIZES BOTH THE PROTECTIONS. TO ALLOW THE SURVIVOR TO HAVE SOMETIME OFF TO SEEK SERVICES AND GET THAT SUPPORT AND THAT HERE SHE MIGHT NEED. ANTI ONE EXAMPLE FROM OUR HELP PLANE RECENTLY WAS FROM A WORKING WOMAN WHO WORKED IN A RESTAURANT WHO IS AND SEXUALLY HARASSED BY A CO WORKER. AND YOU COMPLAIN TO HER EMPLOYER. AND THE EMPLOYER SORT OF INSTRUCTED THE COR GOING TO DO IT ANYMORE BUT SHE STILL HAD TO WORK IN SORT OF A VERY SMALL PHYSICAL SPACE WITH HIM AND SHE REALLY NEEDED. TIME AWAY ON A TIME AWAY FROM THAT SITUATION AND THERE WASN'T. LIKE AN EASIER APPROPRIATE REMEDY IN EXISTING LAW THAT SHE COULD USE TO HELP HER GET THAT BECAUSE THE EMPLOYER HAD SORT OF STOPS THE HARASSMENT FROM HAPPENING IN CONTINUING WHICH WAS IMPORTANT. BUT IT WASN'T THE FULL. I'M RECOVERY THAT SHE NEED AND SHE NEEDED MORE THAN THAT. INTO THIS BILL WOULD REALLY HELP. PEOPLE IN THAT SITUATION ACCESS MORE OF WHAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE WORKING AND AND BE ABLE TO BREAK THE SILENCE AROUND THESE CRITICAL ISSUES. WE WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. BRIAN HOW WITH CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WEREN'T STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. YOU. THE LARGEST RENT POOREST WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. Q.. SORRY MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CHRISTY. BE OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANGELIQUE WITH ANY SW IN SUPPORT. Q.. NICOLE MARQUEZ WORK SAFE IN SUPPORT. RUTH SOBRE TAUPE SANTA CLARA COUNTY WHICH THEY'VE COALITION IN SUPPORT THEY Q. ANYONE ELSE ADDING ON IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD. HI GOOD AFTERNOON LARA CURTIS WITH CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE FIRST ONE I THINK THEY AUTHORS OFFICE BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN WILLING TO I MEET WITH US AND TAKE TIME TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE. AT LENGTH AND THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE CURRENT LANGUAGE A WITHIN THAT THE. BILL A WE HAVE DISCUSSED AMENDMENTS WE HAVE NOT WE'VE YET TO SEE AN AMENDMENTS ALL DISCUSS GENERALLY OUR CONCERNS AS THE BILL STANDS TODAY. FIRST OF ALL THE EXPERTS AT THE ADDITIONAL FAMILY LEAVE IS A CONCERN FOR US JUST BECAUSE ONCE THAT LEAVE IS TAKEN IT'S PROTECTED AND THEN ANY RAMIFICATION BY ANY ACTION THE EMPLOYER TAKES AFTER THAT WOULD THEN BE TIED TO THAT LEAVING COULD THEN BE IMPLICATED AS. TAKING M. AS I AM RETALIATING AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL FOR TAKING THAT WE SO THAT'S OUR CONCERNS WITH THE FAMILY MEMBER LEAVE. ARE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AS DRAFTED NOW IS THERE ISN'T THE PROTECTIONS AROUND THESE. AROUND FOR THE EMPLOYER AROUND THESE TYPES OF LEAVE THAT THERE ARE FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT DOES REQUIRE A POLICE REPORT OR AND SOME SORT OF CERTIFICATION FROM A MEDICAL PROVIDER. AND THAT'S LACKING IN THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF THE BILL SEWN INDIVIDUAL COULD ASSERT THAT THEY WERE TAKING SEXUAL HARASSMENT LEAVE FOR A SIMPLE GLANCE AND FOR SOMEONE ACCIDENTALLY BRUSHING UP AGAINST THEM IN AN ELEVATOR. I'M BECAUSE THERE'S NO FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THE THE SCOPE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS EXTREMELY BROAD AND NOT ALL SEXUAL HARASSMENT WHILE IT'S ALL USUALLY INAPPROPRIATE NOT ALL SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS ACTUALLY ACTIONABLE UNDER THE LAW. AND SO WITHOUT SOME SORT OF NOTIFICATION OR VERIFICATION FOR THE EMPLOYER AND THIS IS A GOOD THIS COULD BE ABUSED AND THAT'S WHERE OUR CONCERN LIES THAT WE WOULD LIKE SOME VERIFICATION. ADDITIONALLY. THERE IS. THE LANGUAGE IS IN THE LABOR CODE AND FEE HA ACTUALLY. CONTROL SEXUAL HARASSMENT RETALIATION DISCRIMINATION IT'S OUR CONCERNS ARE THERE THAT IT'S WE HAVE DISCUSSED WITH THE AUTHOR. AND LET ME JUST NOTE IT. FOR EXAMPLE IN SECTION ONE OF THE BILL. LABOR CODE TO THIRTY. IN SUBDIVISION DE ONE THE EMPLOYER THE EMPLOYER SHALL GIVE THE EMPLOYER REASONABLE ADVANCE NOTICE OF INTENTION TO TAKE OFF. IN DE TO THEN IT SAYS CERTIFICATION SHALL BE SUFFICIENT IN ANY OF THE FOLLOWING FORMS. A TWO A. B. AND SEE THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT. THAT NONE OF THESE INCLUDE SEXUAL HARASSMENT ONLY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT OR STOCKING. SO THERE IS NO NOTICE REQUIRED ON THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT ASPECT TO THE EMPLOYER SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE RECTIFIED AND AGAIN. IN THE ANALYSIS I THINK POINTS OUT A NUMBER OF ISSUES AND WILL CONTINUE TALKING WITH THE AUTHOR ABOUT. SOME THESE LANGUAGE CHANGES THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION. THE CALL RICE CALIFORNIA FACTORS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE ARE OPPOSED FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED THANK YOU THANK YOU. AFTERNOON KIDDIE HANSON CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WERE OPPOSED FOR THE REASONS STATED THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. SCENE NONE WILL TURN TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. TURNED TO THE AUTHOR IT DID YOU WANT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE. CONCERNS RAISED BY OPPOSITION. YES THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FIRST OFF THANK YOU TO TELL YOUR STAFF AND AND AND COMMITTEE FOR. THE DIFFERENT SUGGESTIONS FOR HOW TO STRENGTHEN THE BILL GOING FOUR TO ONE TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THOSE. ON THE SPECIFIC ISSUE AROUND NOTICE IN AND VERIFICATION ITS AND SAFEGUARDS FOR THE EMPLOYER WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD EVERY INTENTION THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT WOULD REQUIRE. WOULD REQUIRE THE SAME VERIFICATIONS AS SEXUAL ASSAULT AND STALKING AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WE THINK WAS A DRAFTING ERROR THAT IT NOT BE INCLUDED WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO COMMIT NOW THAT THEY ALL HAVE THE EXACT SAME. REQUIREMENTS FOR NOTICE AND VERIFICATION SO. IT WAS I'LL ALWAYS OUR ATTENTION THAT WOULD NEED TO WEAR USE THAT CANCERS NOTRE DOCTOR'S NOTE OR POLICE REPORTER COURT DOCUMENT. THAT TO SUPPORT. YOUR. YOU EAT TO JUSTIFY BEING ABSENT SO I WE WILL FIX THAT IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE AND COMMIT TO THAT NOW THAT WAS NEVER INTENDED TO BE THE CASE IN THIS BILL. OUT WE ALSO ARE WE ARE VERY RESPECTFUL OF IN AND THAT WOULD FROM THE COMMITTEE THAT WOULD INCLUDE EXPANDING THE DEFINITION TO INCLUDE OTHER TYPES OF REST INCLUDING RACIAL AND DISABILITY IN AGE NATIONAL ORIGIN. NATIONAL ORIGIN RELIGION. WHERE I AM VERY INTERESTED IN EXPLORING THAT EXPANSION AND AND APPRECIATE THE? SUGGESTION BY THE COMMITTEE. SO I I THINK THAT HELPS ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE WE'VE HAD CONSTRUCTIVE PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION IN WHICH WERE BOTH LISTENING TO EACH OTHER AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO GET CLOSER. CONCERNS AS WE GO FORWARD. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I ASSUME NINE. TURNING TO THE COMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE'S PLEASURE IS OUR MOTION.
