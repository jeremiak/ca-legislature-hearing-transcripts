BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE STILL HAVE

00:26:09.434 --> 00:26:12.837
CONCERNS WITH SB NINE SEVENTY AS

00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:13.939
IT'S DRAFTED. THE PREMISE OF THE

00:26:14.005 --> 00:26:15.640
BILL REALLY RAISES TWO ISSUES

00:26:15.707 --> 00:26:16.775
THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. THE

00:26:16.841 --> 00:26:18.076
FIRST IS WHO SHOULD PROVIDE THE

00:26:18.143 --> 00:26:20.679
OVERSIGHT DAMAGES SAY. AND HOW

00:26:20.745 --> 00:26:21.780
SHOULD THAT OVERSIGHT BE

00:26:21.846 --> 00:26:24.149
CONDUCTED. THE WAY IT HAS BEEN

00:26:24.215 --> 00:26:25.984
FRAMED IN RECENT WEEKS- TO THE

00:26:26.051 --> 00:26:27.585
FIRST QUESTION IS. HEALTH AND

00:26:27.652 --> 00:26:29.454
HUMAN SERVICES OR THE IMAGES SO

00:26:29.521 --> 00:26:31.856
EASY. BUT WHEN WE LOOK TO WHAT

00:26:31.923 --> 00:26:33.591
THE VOTERS ENACTED IN TWO

00:26:33.658 --> 00:26:34.225
THOUSAND FOUR WHEN THEY PASSED

00:26:34.292 --> 00:26:36.127
NOW SERVICES ACT. IT WAS THE

00:26:36.194 --> 00:26:37.362
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. IT WAS THE

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:39.130
DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH THAT

00:26:39.197 --> 00:26:40.098
WAS ESSENTIAL IN AB THIRTY FOUR

00:26:40.165 --> 00:26:41.967
AB TWENTY THIRTY FOUR THAT WILL

00:26:42.033 --> 00:26:43.301
WERE THE PRECURSORS TO MENTAL

00:26:43.368 --> 00:26:45.270
SERVICES ACT. AND ONE VOTERS A

00:26:45.337 --> 00:26:47.806
CALIFORNIA PASSED PROPOSITION-SIXTY THREE THE DEPARTMENT

00:26:47.872 --> 00:26:50.976
MENTAL HEALTH. WAS THE CRUX OF

00:26:51.042 --> 00:26:53.378
THE BILL. AND WHEN THE DRAFTERS

00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:55.480
DRAFTED PROP SIXTY THREE THEY

00:26:55.547 --> 00:26:57.248
DID NOT SEE HER IN THE COULDN'T

00:26:57.315 --> 00:26:58.516
FORESEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:26:58.583 --> 00:26:59.417
HEALTH WOULD BEEN ONLY.

00:26:59.484 --> 00:27:02.253
ELIMINATED AS A WAS IN TWENTY

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.223
ELEVEN. AND SO WHILE WE STRUGGLE

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:07.025
TO DETERMINE WHAT AGENCIES

00:27:07.092 --> 00:27:09.127
SHOULD PROVIDE PROVIDE OVERSIGHT

00:27:09.194 --> 00:27:11.296
TO THE IMAGES SAY I'D AT THIS

00:27:11.363 --> 00:27:12.731
POINT I ASKED FOR THE PART AND

00:27:12.797 --> 00:27:14.065
I'LL BE BROUGHT BACK I BELIEVE

00:27:14.132 --> 00:27:15.900
THAT IS THE BEST AGENCY OR

00:27:15.967 --> 00:27:18.036
SHOULD BE THE BEST A TO SEE

00:27:18.103 --> 00:27:19.404
EQUIPPED TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT.

00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:21.172
FOR THE IMAGE SAY. MOVING TO THE

00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:22.173
SECOND POINT HOW SURE THAT

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.541
OVERSIGHT BE PROVIDED. WHEN THE

00:27:23.608 --> 00:27:25.477
VOTERS PASSED PROPOSITION SIXTY

00:27:25.543 --> 00:27:26.411
THREE THEY WERE TOLD THAT THREE

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:29.547
YEAR PLANS WILL BE REVIEWED AND

00:27:29.614 --> 00:27:30.215
APPROVED BY THE STATE. THAT HAS

00:27:30.281 --> 00:27:32.784
BEEN SENSE ELIMINATE. TO DATE

00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:34.285
THREE YEAR PLANS GO TO THE STATE

00:27:34.352 --> 00:27:36.054
AND THERE IS NO APPROVAL PROCESS

00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:37.956
DONE WHATSOEVER. AND I JUST LIKE

00:27:38.023 --> 00:27:39.724

EFFECTIVE IN ONLY EVIDENCE BASED

01:12:57.773 --> 01:12:59.675
SUPPORT FOR THIS CONDITION IS

01:12:59.742 --> 01:13:00.609

01:33:19.293 --> 01:33:21.796
THAT MANUAL- AND AGAIN WHAT THIS

01:33:21.862 --> 01:33:23.965
DOES IS IT MANDATES A SPECIFIC

01:33:24.031 --> 01:33:26.167
MODEL OF CARE FOR THAT DISORDER.

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:28.336
AND YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW ALL

01:33:28.402 --> 01:33:29.937
THE DETAILS BUT ONE OF MY HEALTH

01:33:30.004 --> 01:33:31.372
PLANS THE KAISER PERMANENTE A

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:33.441
IS. OPERATING A PILOT PROGRAM

01:33:33.507 --> 01:33:37.178
CURRENTLY- IN THE NAPA SONOMA-

01:33:37.244 --> 01:33:39.714
AREA. I ACTUALLY BELIEVE MIGHT

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:41.716
BE A LITTLE BROADER THAN THAT

01:33:41.782 --> 01:33:42.717
GEOGRAPHICALLY BUT ANY CASE WHAT

01:33:42.783 --> 01:33:44.051
THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE TESTING

01:33:44.118 --> 01:33:45.052
OUT THIS PARTICULAR MODEL OF

01:33:45.119 --> 01:33:47.621
CARE IN TO SEE IF IT WORKS AND

01:33:47.688 --> 01:33:48.889
SO- DO YOU TO YOURPOINT ABOUT

01:33:48.956 --> 01:33:50.458
WHETHER THIS IS PREMATURE NOT I

01:33:50.524 --> 01:33:51.792
THINK YOU KNOW. SINCE THERE IS

01:33:51.859 --> 01:33:53.661
AN EXISTING PILOT PROGRAM IN

01:33:53.728 --> 01:33:55.496
PLACE YOU KNOW WE SHOULD SEE

01:33:55.563 --> 01:33:56.197
WITH THAT YIELDS YOU KNOW BEFORE

01:33:56.263 --> 01:33:57.965
WE ACTUALLY GET TO THIS LEVEL

01:33:58.032 --> 01:34:00.835
SPECIFICITY INTO LAW. THANK YOU

01:34:00.901 --> 01:34:02.737
. OKAY THANK YOU CENTER NUMBER.

01:34:02.803 --> 01:34:04.839
WOULD YOU MIND- ALSO GIVING

01:34:04.905 --> 01:34:07.174
COMMENT ON YOU KNOW THE FACT

01:34:07.241 --> 01:34:07.708
THAT PSYCHOSIS IS ALREADY

01:34:07.775 --> 01:34:11.045
COVERED- AND HOW THIS BILL WOULD

01:34:11.112 --> 01:34:13.781
IMPROVE THE SITUATION. SO HERE'S

01:34:13.848 --> 01:34:16.017
WHERE I AGREE I'M GOING TO TURN

01:34:16.083 --> 01:34:18.352
OUR ATTENTION TO THE CENTRAL

01:34:18.419 --> 01:34:19.353
HEALTH BENEFIT UNDER THE

01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:23.491
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. MIDDLE

01:34:23.557 --> 01:34:24.825
HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE

01:34:24.892 --> 01:34:26.394
TREATMENTS MUST BE COVERED

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:29.196
UNDERNEATH THAT. THIS ISN'T.

01:34:29.263 --> 01:34:31.565
IT'S NOT BEING COVERED WE CAN

01:34:31.632 --> 01:34:33.334
REFER BACK TO THAT KAISER STUDY

01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:35.336
NAPA SOLANO AND SONOMA COUNTIES

01:34:35.403 --> 01:34:36.904
THE TIE THE PROJECT LET ME JUST

01:34:36.971 --> 01:34:39.573
BE REALLY CAN'T DENY LIVES IN

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:40.408
THAT REGION. THAT REGION OF

01:34:40.474 --> 01:34:42.443
KAISER AND I'M A FULL DISCLOSURE

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:44.011
KAISER PATIENT THEY HAVE HAD

01:34:44.078 --> 01:34:46.113
TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES WHEN IT

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:48.916
COMES TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE

01:34:48.983 --> 01:34:49.917
WITHIN THAT REGION OF KAISER.

01:34:49.984 --> 01:34:52.686
TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES. AND JUST

01:34:52.753 --> 01:34:54.355
BEING REALLY BLUNT ABOUT IT HOW

01:34:54.422 --> 01:34:56.223
MANY STUDIES IMPACT THEIR PARTY

01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:58.159
SO WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT WE NEED

01:34:58.225 --> 01:35:00.628
TO DO. WE KNOW THAT THE ONLY THE

01:35:00.694 --> 01:35:03.164
ONLY PEER REVIEWED. TREATMENT IS

01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:06.133
C. S. C. S. AND IT'S NOT BEING

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:09.170
PROVIDED. THE ONLY WAY TO BE

01:35:09.236 --> 01:35:10.905
ABLE TO IF AN INDIVIDUAL HAS OUR

01:35:10.971 --> 01:35:12.807
FIRST PSYCHOSIS EPISODE IS TO BE

01:35:12.873 --> 01:35:14.108
ABLE TO GET THEM THE WRAPAROUND

01:35:14.175 --> 01:35:16.043
TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED TO BE

01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:17.912
ABLE TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET.

01:35:17.978 --> 01:35:19.780
AND WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IF WE

01:35:19.847 --> 01:35:21.549
DON'T GET THAT WRAP AROUND

01:35:21.615 --> 01:35:23.717
TREATMENT. IS THAT IT LEADS TO.

01:35:23.784 --> 01:35:25.986
LOSING A JOB. HOMELESSNESS IN

01:35:26.053 --> 01:35:28.522
SOME CITIES. AND THAT'S REMEMBER

01:35:28.589 --> 01:35:30.791
WHAT WE'RE SPENDING THIS YEAR

01:35:30.858 --> 01:35:32.726
FOR HOMELESSNESS IN THE STATE

01:35:32.793 --> 01:35:34.495
FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS.

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:38.065
FOURTEEN BILLION. FOR WILLING TO

01:35:38.132 --> 01:35:40.034
WRAP MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION

01:35:40.101 --> 01:35:42.103
SERVICES AROUND EACH OF THOSE

01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:42.837
FIFTY THOUSAND UNITS THAT WE'RE

01:35:42.903 --> 01:35:45.072
GONNA BE DANCING BUT WE ARE NOT

01:35:45.139 --> 01:35:46.440
GOING TO SPEND THIRTY EIGHT TO

01:35:46.507 --> 01:35:47.808
FIFTY TWO CENTS A MONTH TO BE A

01:35:47.875 --> 01:35:49.710
PROVIDE THE REFERENCE SERVICES

01:35:49.777 --> 01:35:51.345
SOMEONE NEEDS TO HAVE A

01:35:51.412 --> 01:35:51.946
PSYCHOSIS EPISODE. THE POLY.

01:35:52.012 --> 01:35:54.548
THIS ISN'T ABOUT. PEOPLE IT'S

01:35:54.615 --> 01:35:56.350
TALKING ABOUT PROFIT IT'S

01:35:56.417 --> 01:35:59.220
ALREADY COVERED WE WANT TO TALK

01:35:59.286 --> 01:36:00.521
ABOUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS WE

01:36:00.588 --> 01:36:01.922
CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE DEBATES

01:36:01.989 --> 01:36:03.757
WHEN WE KNOW THE ACA SUPPOSED TO

01:36:03.824 --> 01:36:06.127
BE COVERING THIS SO I'M NOT AT

01:36:06.193 --> 01:36:08.329
ALL TRYING TO GET HOT SYMBOL IT

01:36:08.395 --> 01:36:10.798
IS A YOU AT ALL- BUT I'M JUST

01:36:10.865 --> 01:36:11.398
SHARING MY FRUSTRATION THAT

01:36:11.465 --> 01:36:12.433
LITERALLY WE HAD THE MENTAL

01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:13.701
HEALTH PARITY ACT THAT WE

01:36:13.767 --> 01:36:14.902
THOUGHT WERE GOING TO GET THIS

01:36:14.969 --> 01:36:17.705
SOLVED THEN WE HAVE THE ACA AND

01:36:17.771 --> 01:36:18.739
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SOLVE. AND

01:36:18.806 --> 01:36:19.874
NOW WE'RE BACK HERE IN HEALTH

01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:21.308
COMMITTEE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:23.344
IF THIS IS GONNA BE COVERED BY

01:36:23.410 --> 01:36:25.012
THE HEALTH PLANS OR NOT IT NEEDS

01:36:25.079 --> 01:36:26.714
TO BE AND WOULD ASK FOR AN ADULT

01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:28.315
SO WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IT OR

01:36:28.382 --> 01:36:31.352
YOU'RE NOT DISPUTING THE FACT

01:36:31.418 --> 01:36:32.520
THAT IT IS. TECHNICALLY COVERED

01:36:32.586 --> 01:36:34.355
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS. THE PLANS

01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:36.824
ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING. THE

01:36:36.891 --> 01:36:37.892
COVERAGE IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE-

01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:45.933
SAYING OKAY- SO- I. WELL WE NEED

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.868
TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE

01:36:47.935 --> 01:36:49.603
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS

01:36:49.670 --> 01:36:50.504
REALLY TO ADDRESS THE NEED I

01:36:50.571 --> 01:36:52.907
MEAN. I KNOW YOUR BILL DOESN'T

01:36:52.973 --> 01:36:54.408
ADDRESS THAT BUT WE JUST WE

01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:58.145
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO

01:36:58.212 --> 01:37:00.214
ATTEND TO THE NEEDS OF ALL THE

01:37:00.281 --> 01:37:02.383
PEOPLE WHO NEED IT AND I THINK

01:37:02.449 --> 01:37:03.617
YOU KNOW THAT- WHEN YOUR BILLS

01:37:03.684 --> 01:37:05.119
NOT TRYING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM

01:37:05.186 --> 01:37:06.387
I'M JUST SUGGESTING THAT- WITH

01:37:06.453 --> 01:37:08.756
THIS BILL. THOUGH IT REQUIRES

01:37:08.822 --> 01:37:10.257
THE PLANS TO PROVIDE THE

01:37:10.324 --> 01:37:12.793
COVERAGE IT'S NOT A GUARANTEE

01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:14.828
THAT ONE WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND

01:37:14.895 --> 01:37:16.096
THE HELP THAT THEY NEED

01:37:16.163 --> 01:37:17.031
DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY LIVE BUT

01:37:17.097 --> 01:37:19.667
AGAIN THAT'S NOT WHAT YOUR BILL

01:37:19.733 --> 01:37:21.135
IS TRYING TO SOLVE- THAT THE

01:37:21.202 --> 01:37:23.103
ONLY ONE I WOULD SAY ON THIS HE

01:37:23.170 --> 01:37:25.472
SAID. I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS FOR

01:37:25.539 --> 01:37:26.140
PRIVATE PAY INSURANCE SO IF YOU

01:37:26.207 --> 01:37:29.109
ARE- IF YOUR PAIN WE KNOW THAT

01:37:29.176 --> 01:37:30.544
60% OF THE POPULATION THE STATE

01:37:30.611 --> 01:37:31.979
ARE COVERED BY SOME TYPE OF

01:37:32.046 --> 01:37:33.547
PRIVATE PAY INSURANCE. YOU WOULD

01:37:33.614 --> 01:37:35.683
EXPECT THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE

01:37:35.749 --> 01:37:36.884
TO HAVE. THE CARE NEEDED AS

01:37:36.951 --> 01:37:38.652
PROMISED WITH IN THAT PREMIUM

01:37:38.719 --> 01:37:42.223
WELL I'LL TELL YOU THAT- DELAY

01:37:42.289 --> 01:37:44.124
IN MY DISTRICT AND FROM WHAT I'M

01:37:44.191 --> 01:37:47.695
HEARING FROM PARENTS AND FRIENDS

01:37:47.761 --> 01:37:49.230
THAT. IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND

01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:50.931
SOMEONE TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH

01:37:50.998 --> 01:37:52.433
SERVICES PARTICULARLY TO

01:37:52.499 --> 01:37:54.935
ADOLESCENTS- I MEAN THERE'S JUST

01:37:55.002 --> 01:37:56.437
NOT ENOUGH OF THEM AROUND AND

01:37:56.503 --> 01:37:58.138
THEN WHAT THEY'VE DONE. MOST

01:37:58.205 --> 01:38:00.007
RECENTLY AS THEY'VE CHANGED THE-

01:38:00.074 --> 01:38:04.511
THE CARE TO- NOT IN PERSON. THEY

01:38:04.578 --> 01:38:06.080
WANNA DO REAL NINETY ASSUME.

01:38:06.146 --> 01:38:07.815
WHICH IS KIND OF WHAT GOT A LOT

01:38:07.881 --> 01:38:11.085
OF THESE ANYWAY- SO IT'S

01:38:11.151 --> 01:38:12.319
DIFFICULT YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON

01:38:12.386 --> 01:38:14.288
WHERE YOU LIVE IF THEY'RE NOT

01:38:14.355 --> 01:38:15.923
PEOPLE BUT- AGAIN THAT'S- THAT

01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:17.258
THAT IS NOT YOUR PROBLEM TO

01:38:17.324 --> 01:38:19.493
SOLVE RIGHT NOW I JUST WANTED TO

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:20.261
KIND OF HIGHLIGHT THAT THAT THIS

01:38:20.327 --> 01:38:23.330
IS NOT GOING TO BE- YOU KNOW THE

01:38:23.397 --> 01:38:24.732
SILVER BULLET THAT. THAT TO

01:38:24.798 --> 01:38:27.234
HANDLE THIS PROBLEM- BUT I DON'T

01:38:27.301 --> 01:38:29.136
DISAGREE WITH YOU THAT IF THE

01:38:29.203 --> 01:38:31.572
PLAN SAY THEY'RE GOING TO- COVER

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:32.806
SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT YOU

01:38:32.873 --> 01:38:34.475
KNOW THEY SHOULD PROBABLY DO

01:38:34.541 --> 01:38:36.043
THAT SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO

01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:38.045

01:38:38.112 --> 01:38:39.546
COMMENTS CETERA THANK YOU

01:38:39.613 --> 01:38:42.516
MISTER- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE-

01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:45.753
OPPOSITION TENT. SEEMS TO BE

01:38:45.819 --> 01:38:46.887
FOCUSED ON EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY

01:38:46.954 --> 01:38:50.124
AND- IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY

01:38:50.190 --> 01:38:51.325
PER. INDICATING THE PREPS IS

01:38:51.392 --> 01:38:53.060
BILL OXIS INTO A PARTICULAR

01:38:53.127 --> 01:38:55.496
TREATMENT PROTOCOL WHEN.

01:38:55.562 --> 01:38:56.597
TREATMENT PROTOCOLS MAY CHANGE

01:38:56.664 --> 01:38:58.966
IN A- FOR FARM SUPPORTING THE

01:38:59.033 --> 01:39:01.635
BILL. OF THE BILL. AT THE

01:39:01.702 --> 01:39:03.937
APPROPRIATE TIME- IT'S SORT OF

01:39:04.004 --> 01:39:06.440
BEEN MOVED GOOD SO THEY PUT ME

01:39:06.507 --> 01:39:08.208
ON THE LIST- I GUESS MY

01:39:08.275 --> 01:39:09.910
SUGGESTION IS AS THE BILL MOVES

01:39:09.977 --> 01:39:12.046
FORWARD PERHAPS. YOU COULD

01:39:12.112 --> 01:39:14.348
CONSIDER ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE

01:39:14.415 --> 01:39:16.383
THAT SUGGESTS THAT IF MORE

01:39:16.450 --> 01:39:17.985
EFFECTIVE TREATMENT PROTOCOLS

01:39:18.052 --> 01:39:20.054
ARE SUBSEQUENTLY IDENTIFIED.

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:21.922
THOSE MIGHT BE AS MAY BE

01:39:21.989 --> 01:39:23.924
SUBSTITUTED IN PLACE OF THE ONE

01:39:23.991 --> 01:39:26.427
SPECIFIED IN THE BILL. HEY HAPPY

REVIEWED STUDIES- THAT SAYS IT

01:39:35.135 --> 01:39:38.372
C. C. REALLY IS THE- ONLY AND

01:39:38.439 --> 01:39:40.441
MOST EFFECTIVE. WHEN IT COMES TO

01:39:40.507 --> 01:39:43.310
A AN EARLY PSYCHOSIS EPISODE

01:39:43.377 --> 01:39:44.745
BUT- HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE

EXAMPLE M. IS THAT YOU KNOW IT

EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE PAYING TWO

HUNDRED DOLLARS IT COULD GO UP

02:15:34.993 --> 02:15:39.498
BY 60% BUT I MEAN BY SIXTY AND

02:15:39.564 --> 02:15:43.001

02:15:52.777 --> 02:15:54.145
TO THE INDIVIDUAL WHO'S HAVING

02:15:54.212 --> 02:15:55.947

02:15:56.014 --> 02:15:59.417
BENEFITS FIFTY OR SIXTY CENTS A

02:15:59.484 --> 02:16:02.988
MONTH- I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T GET

02:16:03.054 --> 02:16:04.589
MY ARMS AROUND THE FACT THEY

02:16:04.656 --> 02:16:07.392
WERE OVERCHARGING SOME. WHO NEED

02:16:07.459 --> 02:16:09.628
PHARMACEUTICALS TO BENEFIT

02:16:09.694 --> 02:16:12.097
OTHERS. THAT'S WHAT'S GETTING ME

02:16:12.163 --> 02:16:13.698
AND MAYBE THAT'S THE WAY THE

02:16:13.765 --> 02:16:15.367
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WORKS.

02:16:15.433 --> 02:16:18.603
ACTUALLY THIS IS AN OF JOHN

02:16:18.670 --> 02:16:19.704
LEWIS FROM TROOPER PARR SOMEONE

02:16:19.771 --> 02:16:22.040
ELSE INSURE BURKE IS ON THE

02:16:22.107 --> 02:16:24.676
PHONE- TWO MIGHT BE ABLE TO

02:16:24.743 --> 02:16:25.410
ENSURE THAT ADDRESS THAT

02:16:25.477 --> 02:16:35.353
QUESTION OF DOCTOR CENTER. OKAY

02:16:35.420 --> 02:16:37.222
WE DO HAVE ANYONE FROM THE

02:16:37.289 --> 02:16:38.924
CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS

02:16:38.990 --> 02:16:45.096
REVIEW PROGRAM ON. BLIND. SO

02:16:45.163 --> 02:16:47.265
WHAT I WILL SAY WHICH SORT OF

02:16:47.332 --> 02:16:50.569
CAME OUT OF THE RIVER ANALYSIS-

02:16:50.635 --> 02:16:53.204
IS THAT IN THIS IS A AS IT

02:16:53.271 --> 02:16:54.773
RELATES TO INSULIN WHICH IS A

02:16:54.839 --> 02:16:57.175
COMMON DRUG THAT MOST PEOPLE

02:16:57.242 --> 02:17:00.679
NEED THAT MANY PEOPLE NEED- SO

02:17:00.745 --> 02:17:03.148
INSULIN HAD AN 80% REBATE OFF

02:17:03.214 --> 02:17:05.450
THE LIST PRICE THAT WAS PAID FOR

02:17:05.517 --> 02:17:07.953
BY THE PBM. AND SO RIGHT NOW FOR

02:17:08.019 --> 02:17:09.688
EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA

02:17:09.754 --> 02:17:12.958
AND YOU NEED IT- YOU'D BE PAYING

02:17:13.024 --> 02:17:15.393
AT THE PHARMACY FOUR HUNDRED AND

02:17:15.460 --> 02:17:17.095
TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR THE

02:17:17.162 --> 02:17:17.862
INSULIN. SO IF THIS WERE TO

02:17:17.929 --> 02:17:19.931
GOING TO AFFECT YOU WOULD ONLY

02:17:19.998 --> 02:17:21.800
BE PAYING A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

02:17:21.866 --> 02:17:22.968
DOLLARS SO MY UNDERSTANDING AND

02:17:23.034 --> 02:17:25.070
I AM VERY NEW TO THIS SPACE BUT

02:17:25.136 --> 02:17:27.072
IT IS IN THIS WORLD IS

02:17:27.138 --> 02:17:28.940
INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED AND

02:17:29.007 --> 02:17:32.310
HAIRY- AND- TRUTH BE TOLD

02:17:32.377 --> 02:17:34.646
PATIENTS ARE IN A CHOKEHOLD-

02:17:34.713 --> 02:17:37.248
BETWEEN. PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS

02:17:37.315 --> 02:17:39.784
AND INSURANCE PLANS- AND THE

02:17:39.851 --> 02:17:43.254
PBMS WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS THAT

02:17:43.321 --> 02:17:44.022
THIRTY SIX OTHER STATES ARE

02:17:44.089 --> 02:17:45.890
TRYING TO EXTRICATE THEMSELVES

02:17:45.957 --> 02:17:47.325
FROM THIS CHOKEHOLD AS IT

02:17:47.392 --> 02:17:48.827
RELATES TO REBATES BECAUSE THE

02:17:48.893 --> 02:17:51.830
REBATES WERE DESIGNED. TO GO TO

02:17:51.896 --> 02:17:54.299
THE PATIENT OR THE CUSTOMER NOT

02:17:54.366 --> 02:17:56.901
TO THE PBMS AND SO THERE HAS

02:17:56.968 --> 02:17:58.703
BEEN THERE I KNOW THERE ARE ARE

02:17:58.770 --> 02:18:00.672
SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT. I GUESS

02:18:00.739 --> 02:18:02.974
LATE PRICE BREADING ARE SHIFTING

02:18:03.041 --> 02:18:04.809
THE COST TO GO TO SOMEONE ELSE

02:18:04.876 --> 02:18:06.778
SO THAT THE PPL ESSENTIALLY YOU

02:18:06.845 --> 02:18:07.946
CAN RECOUP THE COST THAT YOU

02:18:08.013 --> 02:18:10.348
WOULD BE LOSING. THEM IF

02:18:10.415 --> 02:18:11.883
SOMETHING LIKE THIS WERE TO GO

02:18:11.950 --> 02:18:13.818
INTO A FACT AND THE INFORMATION

02:18:13.885 --> 02:18:15.687
THAT WE GOT WAS THAT AID THE

02:18:15.754 --> 02:18:16.554
SAVINGS HAVE BEEN UNDER

02:18:16.621 --> 02:18:18.123
ESTIMATED THROUGH CHIPPER. BUT

02:18:18.189 --> 02:18:19.891
IF THERE WERE TO BE A PRICE

02:18:19.958 --> 02:18:21.693
INCREASE IT WOULD BE LESS THAN

02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:24.496
POINT FIVE PERCENT. SO I'M

02:18:24.562 --> 02:18:26.331
CERTAINLY ONLY. MEANS THAT

02:18:26.398 --> 02:18:27.866
THEY'RE GOING TO LOWER THE COST

02:18:27.932 --> 02:18:29.534
OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND I

02:18:29.601 --> 02:18:30.802
THINK YOU KNOW WITH THE AT

02:18:30.869 --> 02:18:32.704
RESPECTFULLY TO THE OPPOSITION

02:18:32.771 --> 02:18:34.139
THERE'S BEEN NO CONFLATION OF A

02:18:34.205 --> 02:18:35.607
LOT OF ISSUES BECAUSE YES THE

02:18:35.674 --> 02:18:37.075
COST OF HEALTHCARE IS INCREDIBLY

02:18:37.142 --> 02:18:38.977
HIGH AND YES THE COST OF

02:18:39.044 --> 02:18:40.111
PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS IS

02:18:40.178 --> 02:18:41.746
INCREDIBLY HIGH. AND YES REBATE

02:18:41.813 --> 02:18:44.149
GOING DIRECT. TO THE PATIENT OR

02:18:44.215 --> 02:18:46.918
TO THE CUSTOMER WHO NEEDS THAT-

02:18:46.985 --> 02:18:48.019
I DON'T KNOW THAT ALL OF THOSE

02:18:48.086 --> 02:18:49.721
THINGS CAN GET ADDRESSED AND I

02:18:49.788 --> 02:18:51.122
KNOW THAT YOU ALL PROBABLY

02:19:08.406 --> 02:19:10.775
IT'S BEEN MOVE A CENTER LEYVA-

02:19:10.842 --> 02:19:12.143
THIRTY COME EITHER AT THE END

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING

02:19:14.245 --> 02:19:15.113
WITH OUR COMMITTEE STAFF- TO

02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:16.748
ADDRESS MANY ISSUES- INTERVIEW

02:19:16.815 --> 02:19:19.350
TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH- THE

02:19:19.417 --> 02:19:21.286
OPPOSITION. AS WELL- TO DRESS

02:19:21.352 --> 02:19:22.787
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY

02:19:22.854 --> 02:19:25.890
RAISE BUT AGAIN THAT YOU I THINK

02:19:25.957 --> 02:19:27.625
THAT THERE ARE. WHAT I GUESS

02:19:27.692 --> 02:19:28.860
MAYBE SHORTHAND I'D SAY IS THAT.

02:19:28.927 --> 02:19:29.828
FROM MY UNDERSTANDING THIS BILL

02:19:29.894 --> 02:19:32.597
WOULD ACTUALLY WELL THERE ARE.

02:19:32.664 --> 02:19:34.065
TWO GROUPS THAT THERE MAY BE

02:19:34.132 --> 02:19:36.534
SOME OVERALL. IN TERMS OF ON THE

02:19:36.601 --> 02:19:38.169
PREMIUM SIDE THERE MAY BE SOME

02:19:38.236 --> 02:19:40.371
UPWARD PRESSURE. BUT ACTUALLY

02:19:40.438 --> 02:19:41.806
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY NEED

02:19:41.873 --> 02:19:44.175
THE MEDICATION- THE ABOUT COST

DIRECTLY TO THEM ACTUALLY

02:19:47.512 --> 02:19:49.814
DECREASES. SO IF YOU'RE THINKING

02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:52.884
INSURANCE SHOULD REALLY HELP YOU

02:19:52.951 --> 02:19:53.818
WHEN YOU'RE SICK. THE SERVER

02:19:53.885 --> 02:19:55.386
HEADS IN THAT DIRECTION- BUT

02:19:55.453 --> 02:19:56.755
OBVIOUSLY IT'S A LITTLE MORE

02:19:56.821 --> 02:19:57.989
COMPLICATED THAT BUT I'M SORT OF

02:19:58.056 --> 02:19:59.424
GETTING THE SHORTHAND- SO

02:19:59.491 --> 02:20:00.458
CERTAINLY I'M SUPPORTING THE

02:20:00.525 --> 02:20:02.927
BILL. WITH THE AMENDMENT SAYS

02:20:02.994 --> 02:20:04.796
THAT YOU ACCEPTED- WOULD LIKE TO

02:20:04.863 --> 02:20:06.097
CLOSE. IN A MINUTE KEEP IT SHORT

02:20:06.164 --> 02:20:07.866
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GET IN

02:20:07.932 --> 02:20:09.000
TROUBLE AND I JUST WANNA BLESS

02:20:09.067 --> 02:20:11.636
ALL OF YOU ALL FOR THE WORK THAT

02:20:11.703 --> 02:20:12.937
YOU DO ON THIS COMMITTEE- BUT IF

02:20:13.004 --> 02:20:14.839
THIS BILL WERE TO PASS. ALMOST

02:20:14.906 --> 02:20:16.407
FOURTEEN MILLION PATIENTS COULD

02:20:16.474 --> 02:20:18.143
BENEFIT BECAUSE AT SOME POINT IN

02:20:18.209 --> 02:20:21.813
TIME FOURTEEN MILLION FOLKS WILL

02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:22.814
BE NEEDING TO FILL A

02:20:22.881 --> 02:20:24.549
PRESCRIPTION. ALMOST NINE

02:20:24.616 --> 02:20:25.450
HUNDRED THOUSAND FOLKS IN

02:20:25.517 --> 02:20:27.318
CALIFORNIA TAKING BRAND DRUGS

02:20:27.385 --> 02:20:28.286
AND ARE IN PLANS WITH

02:20:28.353 --> 02:20:30.321
DEDUCTIBLES AND COINSURANCE AND

02:20:30.388 --> 02:20:31.723
SO THEY WOULD BE DIRECTLY

02:20:31.790 --> 02:20:34.359
IMPACTED WITH LOWER COSTS. AND

02:20:34.425 --> 02:20:35.293
FOUR POINT ONE MILLION

02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:36.594
PRESCRIPTIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY

FILLED IN THE STATE OF

02:20:37.929 --> 02:20:39.364
CALIFORNIA COULD BE MADE MORE

02:20:39.430 --> 02:20:41.399
AFFORDABLE. I ALSO WANT TO

02:20:41.466 --> 02:20:42.767
REITERATE THAT THIRTY SIX OTHER

02:20:42.834 --> 02:20:44.669
STATES ARE LOOKING AT BILLS THAT

02:20:44.736 --> 02:20:46.104
CAN ADDRESS THE FACT THAT THE

02:20:46.171 --> 02:20:49.274
REBATES ARE GOING TO THE PBMS

02:20:49.340 --> 02:20:51.142
AND NOT TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED

02:20:51.209 --> 02:20:51.910
THEM MOST PEOPLE THAT WERE. LOVE

ANOTHER I NEEDING TO FILL A

02:20:56.681 --> 02:20:57.182
PRESCRIPTION. AND WHEN THE

02:20:57.248 --> 02:20:58.950
STATE'S AREN'T ABLE TO DO WHAT

02:20:59.017 --> 02:21:00.118
THEY NEED TO DO ACTUALLY THE

02:21:00.185 --> 02:21:02.153
SUPREME COURTS HAVE STEPPED IN-

02:21:02.220 --> 02:21:05.490

THE CRIMINAL COURT PATHWAYS ARE

02:32:58.002 --> 02:32:59.570
NOT AN ENVIRONMENT FROM ANYONE

SMALL. IN THE CASE EITHER

02:33:44.782 --> 02:33:45.883
BECAUSE OF THE KIND OF THE

02:33:45.950 --> 02:33:47.651
CLIENT CAN'T PARTICIPATE OF THE

02:33:47.718 --> 02:33:49.019
GOVERNMENT ENTITIES CAN'T

02:33:50.654 --> 02:33:53.390
PLAN THAT'S PERSON CENTERED THE

THE PROGRAM. WE WILL NOT CHANGE

02:34:23.487 --> 02:34:25.723
THE SYSTEMS OVERNIGHT BUT WE CAN

02:34:25.789 --> 02:34:27.691
MAKE BIG IMPROVEMENTS WE CAN

02:34:27.758 --> 02:34:29.660

BE FRONT OF MIND WE SHOULD

02:35:52.409 --> 02:35:53.777
OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THESE

REQUIREMENT FOR A HOUSING PLAN

02:36:16.300 --> 02:36:17.401
ALLOWS. THE HOUSING PLAN ALLOWS

02:36:17.468 --> 02:36:18.902
THE NEED FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TO

02:36:18.969 --> 02:36:21.171

02:36:30.681 --> 02:36:32.683
LEVEL OF RECENT INVESTMENT. IN

DEDICATED TO BEHAVIORAL. BRIDGE

02:36:45.429 --> 02:36:48.398
HOUSING- THAT IS MEANT TO TARGET

02:36:48.465 --> 02:36:52.169
EXACTLY THE POPULATION CAR THAT

02:36:52.236 --> 02:36:53.170
COULD BE CARE CORPORATIST

02:36:53.237 --> 02:36:54.638
OFFENSE. BEFORE CLOSING I WANT

02:36:54.705 --> 02:36:57.141
TO HAVE ASK A QUESTION OF MINE.

02:36:57.207 --> 02:36:59.576
AS A CLINICIAN WHO IS LED HEALTH

02:36:59.643 --> 02:37:01.745
CARE PROGRAMS FOR THE HOMELESS

02:37:01.812 --> 02:37:04.515
IN SKID ROW IN LOS ANGELES AND

02:37:04.581 --> 02:37:05.816
THROUGHOUT THAT. PROBATIVE

02:37:05.883 --> 02:37:08.352
OVERSEEN JAIL HEALTH SERVICES

02:37:08.418 --> 02:37:10.854
BOTH IN THE ADULT SYSTEM AND THE

02:37:10.921 --> 02:37:13.023
CHILDREN SYSTEM. WHO HAS STARTED

02:37:13.090 --> 02:37:15.392
AND SUPPORTED DIVERSION PROGRAMS

02:37:15.459 --> 02:37:16.760
FOR THOSE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL

02:37:16.827 --> 02:37:20.497
HEALTH ISSUES WHO ARE CAUGHT UP

02:37:20.564 --> 02:37:21.398
IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. I ASK WHY

02:37:21.465 --> 02:37:23.734
DO WE HAVE TO WAIT SO LONG. WHY

02:37:23.801 --> 02:37:25.235
MUST WE WAIT UNTIL THE BOTTOM

02:37:25.302 --> 02:37:27.871
HAS FALLEN OUT. THE CHARGES

02:37:27.938 --> 02:37:30.040
FILED IN THE ARREST IS MADE WHAT

02:37:30.107 --> 02:37:32.543
IS HE MADE ABOUT THAT. WHERE IS

02:37:32.609 --> 02:37:33.844
THE CIVIL IN THE APPROACH TO

02:37:33.911 --> 02:37:36.246
CIVIL LIBERTIES I KNOW THIS IS A

02:37:36.313 --> 02:37:37.714
HARD ISSUE BUT MAYBE IT'S MY

02:37:37.781 --> 02:37:40.150
CLINICAL BENT MY UPSTREAM IS TO

02:37:40.217 --> 02:37:41.885
HOPE. THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT

02:37:41.952 --> 02:37:43.453
UNTIL THE ONLY SYSTEM THAT IS

02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:45.455
CAPABLE AND WILLING TO SERVE OUR

02:37:45.522 --> 02:37:48.625
SICKEST HAS BARS IN FRONT. THAN

02:37:48.692 --> 02:37:50.460
COLD WALLS ON THE SIDE. WHERE

02:37:50.527 --> 02:37:52.529
THE INVESTMENTS ARE STEEP AND

02:37:52.596 --> 02:37:54.498
THE RETURN ON THOSE INVESTMENTS

02:37:54.565 --> 02:37:55.933
ARE QUICKLY SWALLOWED TO THE

02:37:55.999 --> 02:38:00.270
LACK OF ANY INCURRING COMMUNITY

02:38:00.337 --> 02:38:03.774
. I'LL CLOSE BY JUST SAYING-I

02:38:03.841 --> 02:38:05.676
KNOW THIS IS A HARD ISSUE FOR

02:38:05.742 --> 02:38:07.110
MANY OF US AND- THESE ARE

02:38:07.177 --> 02:38:08.912
CHALLENGING THINGS TO CONSIDER I

02:38:08.979 --> 02:38:11.281
THINK TODAY JUST LIKE YESTERDAY

02:38:11.348 --> 02:38:14.251
AND TOMORROW AS WE WORK SIDE BY

02:38:14.318 --> 02:38:16.720

TODAY OPPOSE- THIS CONCEPT THIS

02:38:28.365 --> 02:38:30.934
FRAMEWORK BUT THAT WE CAN FIND

02:38:31.001 --> 02:38:32.302
COMMON GROUND THAT THOSE

02:38:32.369 --> 02:38:34.037
CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION WILL

02:38:34.104 --> 02:38:35.806
REMAIN OPEN AND THERE'S A

02:38:35.873 --> 02:38:37.474
COMMITMENT TO LOOK AT EVERY

02:38:37.541 --> 02:38:39.343
ASPECT OF THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE

02:38:39.409 --> 02:38:41.111
WE PUT THE CALIFORNIA WAY

FORWARD. A STRONG AND COMMITTED

02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:47.351
WAY TO THE SICKEST OF THE SICK

02:38:47.417 --> 02:38:49.019
ON OUR STREETS- SO WITH THAT-

YEARS I'VE BEEN THE CHIEF OF

02:39:34.765 --> 02:39:35.832
PSYCHIATRY AT ALL IF YOU USE

RECEIVE ABOUT FIFTEEN PATIENTS A

02:39:44.274 --> 02:39:46.043
DAY ON- OVER THE YEARS I'VE

02:39:46.109 --> 02:39:47.344
WITNESSED THE RAVAGES. BECAUSE

02:39:47.411 --> 02:39:51.081
OF. AND RELATED. MULTIPLE

02:39:51.148 --> 02:39:51.949
THOUSAND PATIENTS AND THEIR

02:39:52.015 --> 02:39:53.383
FAMILIES. CHARLIE I THINK MANY

02:39:53.450 --> 02:39:54.451
OF THESE SAME PATIENTS VITAL TO

02:39:54.518 --> 02:39:56.420
THE ER. BROKEN OFTEN WITH THEIR

02:39:56.486 --> 02:39:58.455
EXASPERATED PARENTS. RELATED

02:39:58.522 --> 02:39:59.790
STORIES OF THEIR ILL RELATIVES

02:39:59.856 --> 02:40:01.224
EXPERIENCING OVERWHELMING FOR

02:40:01.291 --> 02:40:03.327
CHRONIC SYMPTOMS. INSPECTIONS

02:40:03.393 --> 02:40:04.394
ARE BROUGHT TO THE HOSPITAL

02:40:04.461 --> 02:40:05.896
USUALLY UP SOMETHING GATORS THE

02:40:05.963 --> 02:40:07.631
CURTAINS THOSE BROTHERS. BUT

02:40:07.698 --> 02:40:08.765
THEN GET BETTER WITH APPROPRIATE

02:40:08.832 --> 02:40:11.468
CARE INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED

02:40:11.535 --> 02:40:15.472
TO THE USE. OF MEDICATION.

02:40:15.539 --> 02:40:17.040
AUTOCRINE MANY PATIENTS GET MUCH

02:40:17.107 --> 02:40:18.175
BETTER WITH TREATMENT BUT I THEY

02:40:18.241 --> 02:40:20.844
READ TO IT'S NOT THEIR MED.

02:40:20.911 --> 02:40:22.446
BECAUSE THEY THINK CARE AND OF

02:40:22.512 --> 02:40:25.816
THE PART OVER. WATCHES HAVE IS

02:40:25.882 --> 02:40:28.552
HARD. I DON'T HEAR TO EXPO ABOUT

02:40:28.618 --> 02:40:31.521
HER SOME WILL. A EPISODE BUT

02:40:31.588 --> 02:40:33.090
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANTED TO YOUR

02:40:33.156 --> 02:40:36.026
TO. MY FOCUS IS ON THAT WE- THAT

02:40:36.093 --> 02:40:37.060
IS MEANT HEALTH IS. FOR DOING

02:40:37.127 --> 02:40:38.895
THE STATE AND THEIR- BY NOT

02:40:38.962 --> 02:40:39.663
PROVIDING THEM WITH ADEQUATE

02:40:39.730 --> 02:40:41.365
TREATMENT WHEN THEY NEED IT AND

02:40:41.431 --> 02:40:43.367
FOR AS LONG AS THEY NEED IT.

02:40:43.433 --> 02:40:44.001
ILLNESSES SUCH AS SCHIZOPHRENIA

02:40:44.067 --> 02:40:46.036
OR DISEASES THAT IMPACT DIRECTLY

02:40:46.103 --> 02:40:47.871
ON THE BRAIN. THE RESEARCH IS

02:40:47.938 --> 02:40:49.106
CLEAR THAT THE LONGER A PERSON

02:40:49.172 --> 02:40:51.341
GOES UNTREATED THE WORST LONG

02:40:51.408 --> 02:40:52.876
TERM OUTCOME OF THE CONDITION.

02:40:52.943 --> 02:40:54.144
THAT MEANS GETTING PEOPLE THE

02:40:54.211 --> 02:40:55.178
CHEAPER THAN KEEPING THEM IN

02:40:55.245 --> 02:40:56.546
TREATMENT IS OF THE UTMOST

02:40:56.613 --> 02:40:58.148
PRIORITY ISSUE WITH NOT ONE IS

02:40:58.215 --> 02:41:00.550
DOUBLE RIGHT BECAUSE THEY HELP

02:41:00.617 --> 02:41:01.618
PROFESSIONAL I BELIEVE A

02:41:01.685 --> 02:41:03.487
PATIENT- MOUNTABLE RIGHT SHOULD

02:41:03.553 --> 02:41:05.622
BE ACCESS TO ATTIC TREATMENT.

02:41:05.689 --> 02:41:07.257
WISHFUL THINKING AT BEST IN

02:41:07.324 --> 02:41:09.259
GROSS NEGLIGENT AT WORST TO

02:41:09.326 --> 02:41:10.694
EXPECT THAT A PERSON WITH SEVERE

02:41:10.761 --> 02:41:13.030
PSYCHOSIS WILL BE ENCOURAGED OF

02:41:13.096 --> 02:41:15.032
WHAT IS BEST FOR HIM OR HER. THE

02:41:15.098 --> 02:41:17.067
REASON IS THAT ALL TOO OFTEN

02:41:17.134 --> 02:41:18.001
THESE PATIENTS LACK MEDICAL

02:41:18.068 --> 02:41:19.770

02:41:26.243 --> 02:41:27.844
DECISION MAKING CAPACITY IS NOT

02:41:27.911 --> 02:41:29.913

WAS WRITTEN WHAT. FROM SEPTEMBER

02:57:21.764 --> 02:57:23.699
. JUDITH BAKER IN THIS COMMITTEE

02:57:23.766 --> 02:57:25.434
IS THAT IT'S INTENDED TO BE

02:57:25.501 --> 02:57:26.202
COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY THAT NOBODY

02:57:26.268 --> 02:57:28.704
WOULD BE FORCED TO PARTICIPATE

02:57:28.771 --> 02:57:30.272
IN CARE COURT. BUT WE ALSO HEARD

02:57:30.339 --> 02:57:32.174
THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE

02:57:32.241 --> 02:57:33.309
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS AND

02:57:33.376 --> 02:57:37.513

MEDICAL DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES

02:57:41.584 --> 02:57:43.686
SO IT'S JUST NOT CLEAR TO ME HOW

02:57:43.753 --> 02:57:44.754
CARE RECORD IS GOING TO BE

02:57:44.820 --> 02:57:46.789
VOLUNTARY. AND HOW THERE'S NOT

02:57:46.856 --> 02:57:48.858
GOING TO BE ANY FORS IF IT'S A

02:57:48.924 --> 02:57:51.227

BEING REFERRED BY OTHER PEOPLE

02:57:54.397 --> 02:57:57.266

02:58:00.903 --> 02:58:02.004

HIS- THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT

FORCE TREATMENT IT'S NOT ABOUT

02:58:06.375 --> 02:58:07.209
FORCED MEDICATION. WE THINK THAT

02:58:07.276 --> 02:58:09.278
IF THAT'S TRUE. THE OPPOSITION

02:58:09.345 --> 02:58:10.880
TO THIS IS GOING TO BE A LOT

02:58:10.946 --> 02:58:13.249

03:25:39.493 --> 03:25:42.296
WOULD POINT TO. A THE WHAT I

03:25:42.363 --> 03:25:43.964
WHAT I ALREADY WENT OVER WHAT WE

03:25:44.031 --> 03:25:46.267

03:25:48.002 --> 03:25:49.970
MAYORS. IF THEY WANT TO HAVE

03:25:50.037 --> 03:25:51.906
DOUBLED I THINK YOU KNOW I THINK

03:25:51.972 --> 03:25:53.908
OUR OUR BODIES CERTAINLY AGREES

03:25:53.974 --> 03:25:58.045
WITH THAT- I THINK WHEN WE TALK

03:25:58.112 --> 03:25:59.847
ABOUT KIND OF A- AMOUNT OF

03:25:59.914 --> 03:26:01.782
PEOPLE WERE TALKING TO SEVEN TO

03:26:01.849 --> 03:26:02.983
TWELVE THOUSAND. NOT ALL OF

03:26:03.050 --> 03:26:04.085
THESE PEOPLE IS NOT TO BE ONE

03:26:04.151 --> 03:26:05.820
SIZE SAW RIGHT THEY'RE NOT ALL

03:26:05.886 --> 03:26:07.855
GOING TO GO TO A BED ED- YOU

03:26:07.922 --> 03:26:08.889
KNOW SOMEONE SAID THE GOING TO

03:26:08.956 --> 03:26:10.891
BE A LOCKED FACILITY KIND OF BY

03:26:10.958 --> 03:26:12.693
DEFINITION IT WILL NOT. BE IN A

03:26:12.760 --> 03:26:14.195
LOCKED FACILITY BECAUSE THEY'RE

03:26:14.261 --> 03:26:15.763
NOT GOING TO BE ON LPS AND NOT

03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:17.865
GONNA BE IN THERE AND IT'S NOT

03:26:17.932 --> 03:26:19.333
AN ACUTE SYSTEM WITH THE-

03:26:19.400 --> 03:26:20.835
DEVELOPING IS A SEPARATE ON

03:26:20.901 --> 03:26:21.902
RAMP. TO OUR SYSTEM THAT IS NOT

03:26:21.969 --> 03:26:23.070
A CUTE BUT IS MORE COLLABORATIVE

03:26:23.137 --> 03:26:25.740
. ALSO JUSTIN THAT. WE CAN'T

03:26:25.806 --> 03:26:27.308
DECIDE WHAT KIND OF HOUSING

03:26:27.374 --> 03:26:28.876
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE BECAUSE IT

03:26:28.943 --> 03:26:30.945
COULD VERY. BUT ALSO IF JUST

03:26:31.011 --> 03:26:32.580
LIKE. WITH CHILD WELFARE. IF

03:26:32.646 --> 03:26:34.882
SOMEBODY IS IN A- SETTING WHERE

03:26:34.949 --> 03:26:36.283
THERE'S MORE SUPPORT A FAMILY

03:26:36.350 --> 03:26:37.852
MEMBER. IS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO

03:26:37.918 --> 03:26:39.353
ALLOW THAT PERSON TO LIVE AT

03:26:39.420 --> 03:26:41.255
HOME. OFTENTIMES FOLKS HAVE.

03:26:41.322 --> 03:26:42.890
FAMILY STILL THAT THEY COULD

03:26:42.957 --> 03:26:44.191
POTENTIALLY LIVE WITH. FAMILIES

03:26:44.258 --> 03:26:45.926
HAVE HAD TO DRAW LINES WHEN

03:26:45.993 --> 03:26:47.128
BEHAVIOR IS OUT OF CONTROL. AND

03:26:47.194 --> 03:26:48.095
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY SUPPORTER

03:26:48.162 --> 03:26:50.131

03:26:55.269 --> 03:26:56.871
CHILD BACK HOME POTENTIALLY. OR

03:26:56.937 --> 03:26:59.507

MENTIONED SO. END OF IT. THE

03:32:53.227 --> 03:32:54.361
PARTICIPANTS GIVEN THE LEVEL OF

03:32:54.428 --> 03:32:56.463
INVESTMENT. GIVEN THE RESOURCES

03:32:56.530 --> 03:32:58.132
WE BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA

03:32:58.198 --> 03:32:59.766
COUNTIES CALIFORNIA CITIES.

03:32:59.833 --> 03:33:02.703
CALIFORNIANS ARE THE ENTITIES

03:33:02.769 --> 03:33:04.771
WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY TO

03:33:04.838 --> 03:33:06.273
SERVE. SOME OF THE MOST

03:33:06.340 --> 03:33:08.408
VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS CAN COME

03:33:08.475 --> 03:33:10.410
TOGETHER TO DELIVER ON ALL

03:33:10.477 --> 03:33:12.279
COMPONENTS OF A CARE CORE PLAN.

03:33:12.346 --> 03:33:13.480
YES I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE

03:33:13.547 --> 03:33:14.848
MIGHT BE SHIFTING AND MOVEMENT

03:33:14.915 --> 03:33:16.383
OF STAFF TO MAKE SURE WE DELIVER

03:33:16.450 --> 03:33:17.918
THOSE SERVICES. BUT AS WE'VE

03:33:17.985 --> 03:33:20.554
TALKED ABOUT BEFORE MAKING SURE

03:33:20.621 --> 03:33:22.322
THIS POPULATION MOVES TOWARDS

03:33:22.389 --> 03:33:24.258
THE FRONT OF MIND TO GET THEIR

03:33:24.324 --> 03:33:27.161
SERVICES IS AN IMPORTANT VALUE.

03:33:27.227 --> 03:33:28.395
SUPPORTIVE CARE COURT I WONDERED

03:33:28.462 --> 03:33:30.697
IF WE COME TOGETHER CAN BE DONE

03:33:30.764 --> 03:33:32.900
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SANCTIONS

03:33:32.966 --> 03:33:34.234
AGREE WITH SENATOR UMBERG THE

03:33:34.301 --> 03:33:36.603
DISCRETION BUT THIS CONCEPT SAID

03:33:36.670 --> 03:33:39.506
IF WE REALLY PUSH OURSELVES TO

03:33:39.573 --> 03:33:41.241
SERVE THIS POPULATION WELL. WITH

03:33:41.308 --> 03:33:43.877
THE COMPLETE PLAN THAT INCLUDES

03:33:43.944 --> 03:33:45.412
THE TREATMENT SIDE IN THE HOUSE

03:33:45.479 --> 03:33:48.515
INSIDE THAT INVOLVES NOT JUST

03:33:48.582 --> 03:33:51.051
COUNTIES BUT CITIES AND OTHERS.

03:33:51.118 --> 03:33:53.720
SO THE HOPE IT OF COURSE BUT

03:33:53.787 --> 03:33:55.522
COMING TOGETHER PRIORITIZE AND

03:33:55.589 --> 03:33:57.925
FOCUSING ON THIS POPULATION AS

03:33:57.991 --> 03:33:59.193
CLEARLY AS INTENTIONALLY AS

03:33:59.259 --> 03:34:00.994
POSSIBLE THE BILL SANCTIONS

03:34:01.061 --> 03:34:02.729
WON'T EVER COME INTO PLAY AND

03:34:02.796 --> 03:34:04.765
THAT PATTERNS OF CHALLENGES CAN

03:34:04.831 --> 03:34:06.333
BE ADDRESSED OVER TIME TO MAKE

03:34:06.400 --> 03:34:07.834
SURE THE RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE

03:34:07.901 --> 03:34:09.836
WE KNOW THIS IS AN EASY. BUT

03:34:09.903 --> 03:34:10.938
THIS IS NECESSARY AND THAT'S WHY

03:34:11.004 --> 03:34:12.839
THIS IS YOU KNOW A DIFFICULT

03:34:12.906 --> 03:34:14.374
PART OF THIS CONVERSATION BUT AN

03:34:14.441 --> 03:34:16.043
IMPORTANT WELL YOU KNOW FOR

03:34:16.109 --> 03:34:18.345
LAWYERS AND I KNOW THE ALTARS

03:34:18.412 --> 03:34:19.980
WON'T. ACTUALLY OCCUR A LAWYER

03:34:20.047 --> 03:34:21.815
WHICH I DON'T CLAIM TO BE. BUT

03:34:21.882 --> 03:34:23.617
FOR LAWYERS THE TERM NON

03:34:23.684 --> 03:34:25.586
COMPLIANCES ABSOLUTE. AND WHILE

03:34:25.652 --> 03:34:27.287
THE COURT MAY HAVE DISCRETION I

03:34:27.354 --> 03:34:29.289
THINK AS WE MOVE THIS BILL

03:34:29.356 --> 03:34:30.224
FORWARD AND I PLAN TO SUPPORT

03:34:30.290 --> 03:34:32.960
IT- WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE

03:34:33.026 --> 03:34:33.994
LANGUAGE OF COUNTIES ARE

03:34:34.061 --> 03:34:35.229
CONCERNED ABOUT IT THEN THERE'S

03:34:35.295 --> 03:34:35.862
PROBABLY SOME REASON TO BE

03:34:35.929 --> 03:34:37.531
CONCERNED. AND THERE PROBABLY

03:34:37.598 --> 03:34:39.533
ARE WAYS TO BUILD OFF RAMPS AND

03:34:39.600 --> 03:34:42.302
THE LANGUAGE OF TO BE TO FURTHER

03:34:42.369 --> 03:34:44.571
DEFINE- CONDITION NON COMPLIANCE

03:34:44.638 --> 03:34:46.106
SO THAT IT'S OBVIOUS IF THE

03:34:46.173 --> 03:34:48.108
COURT IS FACED WITH A SITUATION

03:34:48.175 --> 03:34:50.611
WHERE THE COURT IS EXERCISING

03:34:50.677 --> 03:34:53.780
DISCRETION TO DETERMINE THE- THE

03:34:53.847 --> 03:34:55.616
FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE. THAT

03:34:55.682 --> 03:34:56.917
THE COURT ALSO MUST TAKE INTO

03:34:56.984 --> 03:34:58.819
CONSIDERATION VARIOUS FACTORS

03:34:58.885 --> 03:35:01.154
INCLUDING. AVAILABILITY OF

03:35:01.221 --> 03:35:03.056
FUNDING SUPPORT FROM THE STATE-

03:35:03.123 --> 03:35:05.459
AND STAFFING SUPPORT TO MAKE

03:35:05.525 --> 03:35:06.360
THIS PROGRAM WORK THAT'S MY ONLY

03:35:06.426 --> 03:35:09.796
COMMENT- SENATE ROTH IT'S COME

03:35:09.863 --> 03:35:14.034
IT WILL TAKEN OF. THERE IS-

03:35:14.101 --> 03:35:18.672
NEARLY. THE DISCRETION HAS TO BE

03:35:18.739 --> 03:35:21.375
WHERE A ENTITY OF ITS OWN

03:35:21.441 --> 03:35:23.277
VOLITION DECIDES NOT TO USE

03:35:23.343 --> 03:35:25.112
RESOURCES THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE

03:35:25.178 --> 03:35:27.648
AVAILABLE- THERE ARE SOME

03:35:27.714 --> 03:35:28.715
GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES WE'LL VERY

03:35:28.782 --> 03:35:30.584
FEW IN CALIFORNIA WHO WHO MAY

03:35:30.651 --> 03:35:32.552
NOT BE COOPERATIVE IN MAINE MAKE

03:35:32.619 --> 03:35:34.288
A DECISION NOT TO BE COOPERATIVE

03:35:34.354 --> 03:35:36.256
THOSE OF THE ENTITIES THAT

03:35:36.323 --> 03:35:38.292
UNFORTUNATELY MAY END UP FACING

03:35:38.358 --> 03:35:40.093

MONITORING REALLY LOOKS VERY

03:45:31.150 --> 03:45:32.852
DIFFERENTLY IF THERE ISN'T AN

03:45:32.919 --> 03:45:33.987
ABILITY TO CREATE A

03:45:34.053 --> 03:45:35.655
COMPREHENSIVE CARE PLAN IN THE

SIDE OF THE PARTICIPANT TO THEN

03:45:56.709 --> 03:45:58.344
MONITOR THE INVOLVEMENT AND

03:45:58.411 --> 03:46:00.113
ENGAGEMENT IN THAT PLANT SO IT

03:46:00.179 --> 03:46:03.316
REALLY STARTS OUT THAT PER SIXTY

03:46:03.383 --> 03:46:05.051
DAY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT I LIKE

03:46:05.118 --> 03:46:06.753
TO CALL IT ENDING. IS REALLY

03:46:06.819 --> 03:46:09.222
MUCH. YES IN THE CARE COURT

03:46:09.289 --> 03:46:11.190
PROCESS BUT IT STARTS OUT WITH

03:46:11.257 --> 03:46:13.026
THIS PERIOD OF TIME WHERE

03:46:13.092 --> 03:46:15.695
INDIVIDUALS CAN. REALLY FILL IN

03:46:15.762 --> 03:46:17.130
AND BUILD THE PLAN THE OTHER

03:46:17.196 --> 03:46:19.098
COMPONENT IN THE PLAN OR THE

03:46:19.165 --> 03:46:21.034
WHOLE PROCESS THAT WE HAVEN'T

03:46:21.100 --> 03:46:22.468
TALKED ABOUT TODAY IS THE ROLE

03:46:22.535 --> 03:46:24.070
OF A SUPPORTER. BUT SUPPORTER IS

03:46:24.137 --> 03:46:26.372
AN INDIVIDUAL ALONG WITH THE

03:46:26.439 --> 03:46:28.875
FROM A LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR

AREN'T WORKING NOT CONFINEMENT

03:46:35.214 --> 03:46:37.183
WERE LOOKING A COMMUNITY BASED

03:46:37.250 --> 03:46:38.685
SERVICES WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT

03:46:38.751 --> 03:46:40.219
ART SUBSTITUTE DECISION MAKING

03:46:40.286 --> 03:46:42.121
WE'RE LOOKING AT A SUPPORT OF

03:46:42.188 --> 03:46:43.957
DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND NOT

03:46:44.023 --> 03:46:45.291
SUPPORTER WORKING WITH THE

03:46:45.358 --> 03:46:49.028
CLIENT- WITH THE INDIVIDUAL. CAN

03:46:49.095 --> 03:46:50.596

OVERTIME TAKES THAT INTO ACCOUNT

03:47:00.340 --> 03:47:01.808
THAT HAS AN INDIVIDUAL

03:47:01.874 --> 03:47:03.776
POTENTIALLY STABILIZERS ON

03:47:03.843 --> 03:47:05.912
MEDICATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY THE

03:47:05.979 --> 03:47:06.913
COMPONENTS OF THE CARE PLAN

03:47:06.980 --> 03:47:09.182
WOULD CHANGE OVER THE COURSE OF

03:47:09.248 --> 03:47:11.551
THE YEAR. BUT THE IDEA IS THAT

03:47:11.617 --> 03:47:12.785
IN THAT FIRST YEAR. THE

03:47:12.852 --> 03:47:15.388

03:47:55.194 --> 03:47:58.064
I'M NOT SEEING ANYWHERE IN THIS

03:47:58.131 --> 03:48:00.533
BILL WHERE IT'S- NECESSARILY

03:48:00.600 --> 03:48:05.071
VOLUNTARY- WITH THE EXCEPTION OF

03:48:05.138 --> 03:48:06.372
WHAT YOU OUTLINED OF SOMEONE

03:48:06.439 --> 03:48:07.807
SAYING OKAY YOU'RE RIGHT I NEED

03:48:07.874 --> 03:48:09.442
SOME HELP AND I'M GONNA AGREE TO

03:48:09.509 --> 03:48:10.877
THIS PLAN THEN I UNDERSTAND WHAT

03:48:10.943 --> 03:48:12.111
YOU'RE SUGGESTING ABOUT IF THEY

03:48:12.178 --> 03:48:14.414
RENEGE ON THAT BUT I'M TALKING

03:48:14.480 --> 03:48:16.682
ABOUT. FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT

03:48:16.749 --> 03:48:19.652
AGREED TO A PLAN JUST WHAT ARE

03:48:19.719 --> 03:48:21.287
THE PARAMETERS HERE AND RIGHT

03:48:21.354 --> 03:48:23.456
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

03:48:23.523 --> 03:48:26.259
IT. SO- I THINK THE RIGHT WAY TO

03:48:26.325 --> 03:48:28.327
ANSWER THAT QUESTION IS THAT

03:48:28.394 --> 03:48:31.497
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT-

03:48:31.564 --> 03:48:33.466
INTERESTED OR NOT COMING FORWARD

03:48:33.533 --> 03:48:36.002
IN FONG WORKING WITH THE COUNTY

03:48:36.069 --> 03:48:38.404
THE COURT ON THE PLAN- THEY

03:48:38.471 --> 03:48:40.840
WOULD FALL OUT OF THE PROGRAM IN

03:48:40.907 --> 03:48:43.142
THAT INDIVIDUAL HOPEFULLY WE

03:48:43.209 --> 03:48:45.745
CONTINUE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL TO

03:48:45.812 --> 03:48:48.314
WORK WITH THE INDIVIDUAL FIGURE

03:48:48.381 --> 03:48:50.516
OUT WHETHER THERE'S SOME OTHER

03:48:50.583 --> 03:48:55.321
OPTIONS BUT- YOU. WE ON THE SORT

03:48:55.388 --> 03:48:56.622
OF NORMAL COURSE THAT WE SEE

03:48:56.689 --> 03:48:59.225
TODAY SOME INDIVIDUALS MAY HAVE

03:48:59.292 --> 03:49:01.461
BEEN RECENTLY UNDER FIFTY ONE

03:49:01.527 --> 03:49:02.829
FIFTY HOLDS IN A HOSPITAL THERE

03:49:02.895 --> 03:49:04.497
VULNERABLE TO GO BACK INTO THAT

03:49:04.564 --> 03:49:05.798
PROCESS AND DONNA

03:49:05.865 --> 03:49:07.533
CONSERVATORSHIP PATH WE KNOW

03:49:07.600 --> 03:49:09.068
THAT MANY INDIVIDUALS END UP

03:49:09.135 --> 03:49:10.937
ENCOUNTERING LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:49:11.003 --> 03:49:12.805
MAYBE ARE CHARGED AND ARRESTED

03:49:12.872 --> 03:49:15.875
PLACED IN COUNTY JAIL IF IT'S A

03:49:15.942 --> 03:49:18.444
MISDEMEANOR OR A FELONY. MAYBE

03:49:18.511 --> 03:49:20.480
IN TRIAL A DEFENDANT AND THAT

03:49:20.546 --> 03:49:21.747
HAS ITS OWN PATH SO THERE'S A

03:49:21.814 --> 03:49:23.783
NUMBER OF OTHER PATHS THAT THE

03:49:23.850 --> 03:49:26.619
INDIVIDUALS VULNERABLE FOR THAT

03:49:26.686 --> 03:49:27.553
CARE COURT THE PROCESS OF CARE

03:49:27.620 --> 03:49:31.591
COURT- REALLY REMOVES THEM OUT

03:49:31.657 --> 03:49:33.893
OF THOSE SITUATIONS. AND SO WILL

03:49:33.960 --> 03:49:37.797
THE CONSEQUENCE OF NOT.

03:49:37.864 --> 03:49:39.765
COMPLYING OR PARTICIPATING IN

03:49:39.832 --> 03:49:41.734
THE CARE CORP PLANT IS THAT

03:49:41.801 --> 03:49:44.370
THOSE EXISTING PATHWAYS THE

03:49:44.437 --> 03:49:47.039
TOOLS THAT EXIST TODAY COULD

03:49:47.106 --> 03:49:48.841
COME INTO PLAY DOWN THE ROAD FOR

03:49:48.908 --> 03:49:50.676
THE INDIVIDUAL THE WHOLE IDEA OF

03:49:50.743 --> 03:49:52.812
CARE CORD IS TRY TO. PROVIDE THE

03:49:52.879 --> 03:49:55.581
PROGRAM A SYSTEM THAT OF US

03:49:55.648 --> 03:49:57.316
GOING DOWN THOSE OTHER PATHWAYS

03:49:57.383 --> 03:49:59.852
AND SO. IN THAT SENSE THE

03:49:59.919 --> 03:50:03.389
INDIVIDUAL HAS THE FULL RIGHT TO

03:50:03.456 --> 03:50:05.825
SAY NOT GOING TO COMPLY AND THEN

03:50:05.892 --> 03:50:09.595
THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE DOWN

03:50:09.662 --> 03:50:17.303
THAT PATH SO OUR HOPE IS THAT.

03:50:17.370 --> 03:50:19.605
ALLOWS IT SAID- MAYBE

03:50:19.672 --> 03:50:21.174
STABILIZATION ON MEDICATIONS

03:50:21.240 --> 03:50:22.508
WILL ALLOW IT THAT THAT

03:50:22.575 --> 03:50:24.310
INDIVIDUAL WILL GET THE FULL

03:50:24.377 --> 03:50:26.579
PACKAGE OF SERVICES CAN BE ABLE

03:50:26.646 --> 03:50:28.214
TO BE STABLY HOUSED AND

03:50:28.281 --> 03:50:30.149
SUPPORTED IN THE COMMUNITY. OKAY

03:50:30.216 --> 03:50:32.785
SO LET ME SEE IF I UNDERSTAND

03:50:32.852 --> 03:50:36.322
THIS YOU HAVE. YOU'RE PROBABLY

03:50:36.389 --> 03:50:38.524
GONNA HAVE SOMEBODY IN CUSTODY

03:50:38.591 --> 03:50:41.861
RIGHT. SO NOT NECESSARILY THAT

03:50:41.928 --> 03:50:43.196
THEY SHOULD BREAK BECAUSE I

03:50:43.262 --> 03:50:44.330
BECAUSE I THINK WHAT GOES WITH

03:50:44.397 --> 03:50:46.866
WHAT I HEAR YOU ASKING IS THAT

03:50:46.933 --> 03:50:49.335
IT'S IT SAYS IT'S WILL BE A

03:50:49.402 --> 03:50:51.003
COURT ORDER RIGHT AND SO THEN

03:50:51.070 --> 03:50:52.038
YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT MEANS

03:50:52.104 --> 03:50:53.839
IT'SNOT VOLUNTARY. BUT DO YOU

03:50:53.906 --> 03:50:55.541
SEE WHEN YOU'RE ALSO IN YOUR

03:50:55.608 --> 03:50:56.943
READ THE BILL DO YOU SEE

03:50:57.009 --> 03:50:59.946
ANYTHING IN THERE THAT SAYS THEN

03:51:00.012 --> 03:51:02.148
THIS WILL HAPPEN TO YOU YEAH IF

03:51:02.215 --> 03:51:02.982
THEY'RE IN ELIGIBLE FOR

03:51:03.049 --> 03:51:04.317
DIVERSION I SEE THAT IN HERE

03:51:04.383 --> 03:51:07.253
OKAY THAT MEANS AND THEN WAS DR

03:51:07.320 --> 03:51:07.987
KELLY SAID THEN THEY WOULD BE

03:51:08.054 --> 03:51:10.756
THAT WOULD BE IT WAS TO. RIGHT

03:51:10.823 --> 03:51:12.358
ANY THESE PEOPLE HAVE SUPPORTERS

03:51:12.425 --> 03:51:13.593
WITH THEM. MANAGERS TRYING TO

03:51:13.659 --> 03:51:15.394
HELP THEM. SEE IF THEY CAN MAKE

03:51:15.461 --> 03:51:17.129
THOSE DECISIONS. IF THEY CAN'T.

03:51:17.196 --> 03:51:18.831
THEN THEY WOULD BE RIGHT THERE

03:51:18.898 --> 03:51:20.132
THERE THERE THERE WILL BE NO

03:51:20.199 --> 03:51:22.168
TIME WHERE SOMEBODY WILL SAY.

03:51:22.235 --> 03:51:23.269
THE COURT IS NOW TAKING YOU

03:51:23.336 --> 03:51:24.403
SOMEWHERE ELSE. RIGHT THE COURT

03:51:24.470 --> 03:51:26.872
IS NOW SAYING THIS. BUT IF YOU

03:51:26.939 --> 03:51:29.075
IF YOU REFUSE TO ENGAGE IN THE

03:51:29.141 --> 03:51:31.944
TREATMENT THAT YOU'VE AGREED TO.

03:51:32.011 --> 03:51:33.913
THE POTENTIALLY. YOU WOULD END

03:51:33.980 --> 03:51:34.914
UP IN THE SYSTEM. THAT WE TALK

03:51:34.981 --> 03:51:36.916
ABOUT. WHAT TIME OKAY. THIS BACK

03:51:36.983 --> 03:51:37.950
TO THE PROBLEM THOUGH RIGHT

03:51:38.017 --> 03:51:40.286
BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE OUT THERE

03:51:40.353 --> 03:51:42.221
WHO CAN'T. POSSIBLY KNOW WHAT'S

03:51:42.288 --> 03:51:43.756
BEST FOR THEM THAT'S WHY THEY'RE

03:51:43.823 --> 03:51:46.759
IN THE PREDICAMENT WE HAVE FIFTY

03:51:46.826 --> 03:51:47.893
ONE FIFTY FIFTY TWO FIFTY AND

03:51:47.960 --> 03:51:48.794
THE CONSERVATORSHIP PROCESS.

03:51:48.861 --> 03:51:49.895
OKAY BUT THAT'S THAT HASN'T

03:51:49.962 --> 03:51:51.364
SOLVED THE PROBLEM UP TO THIS

03:51:51.430 --> 03:51:52.698
POINT THAT'S WHY YOU'RE

03:51:52.765 --> 03:51:55.301
INTRODUCING THIS BILL- SO YOU

03:51:55.368 --> 03:51:56.902
HAVE PEOPLE WHO JUST CAN'T MAKE

03:51:56.969 --> 03:51:58.337
THOSE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES

03:51:58.404 --> 03:52:00.773
OR WON'T- AND THEN THE

03:52:00.840 --> 03:52:02.675
CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IF YOU'RE

03:52:02.742 --> 03:52:04.076
SAYING THAT THEY CAN DENY THEY

03:52:04.143 --> 03:52:05.411
CAN SAY NO I'M NOT INTERESTED.

03:52:05.478 --> 03:52:07.046
CARE CORD THE CONSEQUENCE OF

03:52:07.113 --> 03:52:08.881
THAT WOULD BE THAT THEY JUST END

03:52:08.948 --> 03:52:10.149
UP RIGHT BACK IN THE JUDICIAL

03:52:10.216 --> 03:52:11.917
SYSTEM AND THEN RIGHT BACK ON

03:52:11.984 --> 03:52:13.452
THE STREET WHILE WHICH PUTS HIS

03:52:13.519 --> 03:52:14.654
BACK TO BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE.

03:52:14.720 --> 03:52:18.224
YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO- ZONE IN

03:52:18.291 --> 03:52:20.159
ON THE PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY.

03:52:20.226 --> 03:52:23.262
VERY VULNERABLE AND JUST CANNOT.

03:52:23.329 --> 03:52:26.132
MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS RIGHT.

03:52:26.198 --> 03:52:32.605
SO THAT THE STATE- SOMEONE WHO

03:52:32.672 --> 03:52:36.309
IS IN A CUTE SORT OF. PSYCHOSES

03:52:36.375 --> 03:52:39.378
WHO IS SOLUTION ON FOUND IN THE

03:52:39.445 --> 03:52:41.113
MIDDLE STREET AND CAN'T MAKE A

03:52:41.180 --> 03:52:42.948
DECISION THAT PERSON CAN'T MAKE

03:52:43.015 --> 03:52:44.383
A DECISION TO ENGAGING CARE

03:52:44.450 --> 03:52:47.019
COURT BUT THEY COULD BE ON A

03:52:47.086 --> 03:52:48.087
SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD DURING

03:52:48.154 --> 03:52:49.155
THAT PERIOD OF TIME IT COULD

03:52:49.221 --> 03:52:50.956
STABILIZE SEVENTY TWO IS TOO

03:52:51.023 --> 03:52:53.025
SHORT I THINK BUT FOR A LONGER

03:52:53.092 --> 03:52:54.927
GOOD WHERE THEY'RE- STABILIZED

03:52:54.994 --> 03:52:56.462
ONCE THEY'RE STABILIZED THEY CAN

03:52:56.529 --> 03:52:58.264
START TO MAKE DECISIONS. BUT TO

03:52:58.331 --> 03:53:01.467
YOUR POINT- WELL WAIT DOES THAT

03:53:01.534 --> 03:53:03.302
I MEAN I'M SORRY DID YOU WHEN

03:53:03.369 --> 03:53:05.438
PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO BE FOR

03:53:05.504 --> 03:53:06.839
EXAMPLE PICKED OFF FROM

03:53:06.906 --> 03:53:09.508
UNDERNEATH THE BRIDGE IN BASIL

03:53:09.575 --> 03:53:11.711
PLACED IN THE CARE COURT WITHOUT

03:53:11.777 --> 03:53:13.646
ANY KNOWLEDGE CONSENT OR

03:53:13.713 --> 03:53:16.248
AWARENESS THERE OFF. I SUPPOSE I

03:53:16.315 --> 03:53:18.351
SHOULD LET DR KELLY FURTHER

03:53:18.417 --> 03:53:20.152
EXPLAINED BUT- I'M JUST THINKING

03:53:20.219 --> 03:53:21.153
OF YOU KNOW THAT THOSE WHO HAVE

03:53:21.220 --> 03:53:25.291
SEVERE MENTAL ISSUES ARE I MEAN.

03:53:25.358 --> 03:53:26.792
THEY JUST MAGICALLY RECOVER

03:53:26.859 --> 03:53:28.561
AFTER SEVENTY TWO HOURS PROBABLY

03:53:28.627 --> 03:53:29.562
NINE THEY'VE BEEN ON THE STREETS

03:53:29.628 --> 03:53:32.098
SO THEY DON'T THEY WERE GOING TO

03:53:32.164 --> 03:53:35.835
GET HER PLANNED SO- SO FAR. NO

03:53:35.901 --> 03:53:40.005
WE ARE. AND CAL. FIVE DEPENDING

03:53:40.072 --> 03:53:42.108
ON HOW YOU. START YOUR YOU MIGHT

03:53:42.174 --> 03:53:43.909
GO FROM. SEVEN TWO HOUR HOLD TO

03:53:43.976 --> 03:53:45.778
A FOURTEEN DAY HOLD EVEN A

03:53:45.845 --> 03:53:48.013
THIRTY DAY HOLD DOWN A TEMPORARY

03:53:48.080 --> 03:53:49.682
CONSERVATORSHIP PROCESS TO

03:53:49.749 --> 03:53:51.450
CONSERVATORSHIP THAT THE PATHWAY

03:53:51.517 --> 03:53:55.054
THAT. LOT OF CLINICIANS AN ACUTE

03:53:55.121 --> 03:53:57.156
PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES MY MOVE A

03:53:57.223 --> 03:53:59.425
PATIENT DOWN INVOLVING THE COURT

03:53:59.492 --> 03:54:01.994
SYSTEM- NEARLY EVERY STEP OF THE

03:54:02.061 --> 03:54:03.496
WAY IF NOT ENTIRELY EVERY STEP

03:54:03.562 --> 03:54:05.464
OF THE WAY. THE IDEA HERE IS

03:54:05.531 --> 03:54:07.867
SOME PEOPLE TO STABILIZE. IF

03:54:07.933 --> 03:54:09.468
IT'S NOT SEVENTY TOWARDS

03:54:09.535 --> 03:54:11.137
FOURTEEN DAYS MAYBE THEN THE

03:54:11.203 --> 03:54:13.072
RELEASED AND RETURNED RIGHT TO

03:54:13.139 --> 03:54:14.173
THE SITUATION THAT THEY WERE IN

03:54:14.240 --> 03:54:16.342
BEFORE. ONE CONCEPT FOR CARE

03:54:16.409 --> 03:54:17.877
COURT AND WE BELIEVE IT WILL BE

03:54:17.943 --> 03:54:20.079
A COMMON REFERRAL PATTERN IS OUT

03:54:20.146 --> 03:54:22.348
OF. THE SITUATION INTO VICTOR

03:54:22.415 --> 03:54:24.717
COURT PROGRAM WHERE IN A MORE

03:54:24.784 --> 03:54:27.153
STABILIZE PATIENT PERSON FIVE

03:54:27.219 --> 03:54:29.655
CAN PARTICIPATE. MEET THE

TOGETHER BUILD THE PLAN THE CARE

03:54:34.059 --> 03:54:34.960
PLAN ALL THE COMPONENTS WE

03:54:35.027 --> 03:54:38.097
MENTIONED AND HOPEFULLY AVOID

03:54:38.164 --> 03:54:41.333
GOING DOWN. THE CAREEN TOWARD.

03:54:41.400 --> 03:54:43.969
MANY CLIENTS OF ARE EXPERIENCE

03:54:44.036 --> 03:54:47.573
SO- YOU KNOW THAT IS ONE ONE

03:54:47.640 --> 03:54:50.109
CONCEPT THAT WE THINK IS A

03:54:50.176 --> 03:54:52.278
VIABLE PATHWAY FOR THE CARE COR

03:54:52.344 --> 03:54:54.346
PROGRAM AND I THINK DEMONSTRATES

03:54:54.413 --> 03:54:56.215
HOW WE'RE MOVING YOU OUT OF THE

03:54:56.282 --> 03:54:58.651
SYSTEM THAT IS OFTEN ENTIRELY

03:54:58.717 --> 03:55:00.119
INVOLUNTARY WHERE DECISION

03:55:00.186 --> 03:55:02.154
MAKING IS SUBSTITUTED FOR

03:55:02.221 --> 03:55:05.257
CONFINEMENT I OFTEN THE-

03:55:05.324 --> 03:55:06.926
FINANCIAL SIDE OF PLACEMENTS

03:55:06.992 --> 03:55:08.661
INTO ONE THAT IS DEEPLY

03:55:08.727 --> 03:55:10.463
COMMUNITY BASED WORKS TO REALLY

03:55:10.529 --> 03:55:12.698
BRING THE DESIRES AND WISHES AS

03:55:12.765 --> 03:55:14.867
MUCH AS THOSE CAN BE CLEANED AND

03:55:14.934 --> 03:55:16.035
EVOLVED OVER TIME OF THE

03:55:16.101 --> 03:55:19.538
PARTICIPANTS INTO THE PLAN. AND

03:55:19.605 --> 03:55:21.440
FOCUS IS ON HOUSING- THERE'S A

03:55:21.507 --> 03:55:23.676
CORE PILLAR TENANT AND I WILL

03:55:23.742 --> 03:55:25.945
JUST LIFT UP ONE CONCEPT THAT

03:55:26.011 --> 03:55:27.413
WAS MENTIONED EARLIER IT'S

03:55:27.480 --> 03:55:29.181
ABSOLUTELY SORT OF THE ONE TWO

HEALTH CHALLENGES AND WE HOPE

04:11:08.920 --> 04:11:10.155
SECTOR GOLLY TALKED ABOUT. AND

04:11:10.221 --> 04:11:11.089
HE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW.

04:11:11.156 --> 04:11:11.990
THEY'RE NOT IN THE LINE WELL

04:11:12.056 --> 04:11:14.225
LET'S PUT IT AT THE FRONT OF THE

04:11:14.292 --> 04:11:15.994
LINE WHEN IT COMES TO THE

04:11:16.060 --> 04:11:17.128
HOUSING PART BECAUSE ALL THE

04:11:17.195 --> 04:11:19.230
OTHER PARTS ARE GONNA REALLY

04:11:19.297 --> 04:11:19.898
WORK THAT WELL. ABOUT IT. THEN I

04:11:19.964 --> 04:11:21.833
WOULD SAY IS THAT AT LEAST WHILE

04:11:21.900 --> 04:11:22.934
THEY'RE UNDER THE CARE COURT

04:11:23.001 --> 04:11:24.769
PLAN HOWEVER LONG IT ISN'T- AND

04:11:24.836 --> 04:11:26.304
ASSUME YOU KNOW THEIR COPIES OF

04:11:26.371 --> 04:11:27.605
THAT. THAT THEY ARE SURE

04:11:27.672 --> 04:11:29.674
CONTINUED HOUSING SO THAT

04:11:29.741 --> 04:11:30.809
DOESN'T S. IMMEDIATE SANDY SAXON

04:11:30.875 --> 04:11:32.243
PLACE THAT WERE INITIALLY SIGNED

04:11:32.310 --> 04:11:33.878
BUT- THEY CAN'T BE DESTRUCTION A

04:11:33.945 --> 04:11:35.213
PLACE WITH ANOTHER PLACE TO GO

04:11:35.280 --> 04:11:36.748
TO KNOWS YOU CAN'T JUST THIS

04:11:36.815 --> 04:11:38.116
CHARGE AND ON TO THE STREET. NOW

04:11:38.183 --> 04:11:39.784
OF COURSE THEY'LL COOPERATE AND

04:11:39.851 --> 04:11:40.819
OTHER THINGS THEY FALL OUT

04:11:40.885 --> 04:11:42.387
ALREADY IN THE CONSERVATORSHIP.

04:11:42.454 --> 04:11:43.188
ALL THE BUT AT LEAST WHILE

04:11:43.254 --> 04:11:45.490
THEY'RE- IN THE PLAN. SO I GUESS

04:11:45.557 --> 04:11:48.560
I'D- ASK IS THAT. SOMETHING ELSE

04:11:48.626 --> 04:11:50.695
AT THE LEASING CONCEPT IS THAT A

04:11:50.762 --> 04:11:51.362

THE COURT IS NOT DESTROY THE

04:12:38.776 --> 04:12:39.811
FRIENDLIEST PLACE IN THE WORLD.

THIS ON FROM THE IS IT MAY BE.

04:12:46.751 --> 04:12:48.353
AND OUR DESIRE THAT THAT'S NOT

04:12:48.419 --> 04:12:49.854
THE NECESSARILY THE INITIAL

04:12:49.921 --> 04:12:51.890
COUNTER YOU WANT IT CENTER OF

04:12:57.295 --> 04:12:58.396
WE'RE SWAPPING OUT LOWER

04:12:58.463 --> 04:13:00.231
GUIDANCE ON THE COURT. AND THEY

04:13:00.298 --> 04:13:02.133

WHICH IS ACTUALLY AND PERHAPS

04:13:07.839 --> 04:13:08.273
EVEN LESS FRIENDLY THAN

04:13:08.339 --> 04:13:10.508
HOPEFULLY WE CAN. BEAT SO I GET

04:13:10.575 --> 04:13:13.478

FURTHER. AND THE END SO- BUT- OF

04:14:17.508 --> 04:14:19.210
LITTLE CONCERN ABOUT THE- ADDING

04:14:19.277 --> 04:14:21.512

LANGUAGE TO SHORTEN THAT

04:14:25.550 --> 04:14:26.250
TIMELINE RECOGNIZING THAT MAYBE

04:14:26.317 --> 04:14:27.852
IT'S NOT SO MUCH A STRICT LIKE

04:14:27.919 --> 04:14:30.221
YOU'VE BEEN SEEING AN EXCIMER

04:14:30.288 --> 04:14:31.155
MONTH BUT THAT SO THAT THAT YOU

WORK IS CLEARLY DROPPING OFF AT

04:14:39.197 --> 04:14:41.099
THE END BUT THAT THERE ARE BUT

04:14:41.165 --> 04:14:43.801
THAT THERE ARE SOME. I'M GOING

04:14:43.868 --> 04:14:46.304
FLAT OUT MONITORING- FOLLOW UP

04:14:46.371 --> 04:14:48.272

04:14:48.339 --> 04:14:49.307
SEND ARE FILLED. ATTEMPT BY

04:14:49.374 --> 04:14:52.877
FACEBOOK BUT- THAT. THAT THAT WE

04:14:52.944 --> 04:14:54.379
HAVE A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE

04:14:54.445 --> 04:14:56.881
CARE FOR TO CARRY COURT WHEN THE

04:14:56.948 --> 04:14:59.917
LAST TIME THEY ACTUALLY HAD.

04:14:59.984 --> 04:15:04.188
BOTH THREE AGO. YES- IS AS WE

04:15:04.255 --> 04:15:06.691
SPOKE BEFORE I THINK IT'S A

04:15:06.758 --> 04:15:08.059
REALLY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION

04:15:08.126 --> 04:15:10.061
YOU WANT EVALUATIONS THAT ARE

04:15:10.128 --> 04:15:12.196
ARMENIAN FULL YOU GUYS ARE UP TO

04:15:12.263 --> 04:15:14.065
DATE WE UNDERSTAND THE RELAPSING

04:15:14.132 --> 04:15:16.801
REMITTING NATURE ESPECIALLY WITH

04:15:16.868 --> 04:15:18.603
THE TREATMENT OF THE CONDITIONS

04:15:18.670 --> 04:15:21.506
THAT ARE FOCUSED ON FOR CARE

04:15:21.572 --> 04:15:23.174
COURTS SO I THINK IT'S AN

04:15:23.241 --> 04:15:25.910
IMPORTANT ISSUE AS I SAID- WE-

04:15:25.977 --> 04:15:27.612
HAVE A NUMBER OF IN. WILL LIKELY

04:15:27.679 --> 04:15:29.547

SEVENTY TWO FOURTEEN DAY HOLD

04:15:33.384 --> 04:15:35.620
PROCESS HE'S IN CALIFORNIA AND

04:15:35.687 --> 04:15:37.188
THEN JUST TO THE POINT TAT YOU

04:15:37.255 --> 04:15:38.623
MADE ON. THE INVOLVEMENT OF

04:15:38.690 --> 04:15:41.993
COURTS FIVE. WE LOOK- I KNOW THE

04:15:42.060 --> 04:15:45.563
FELONY I S. T. DATA BETTER BUT I

04:15:45.630 --> 04:15:47.865
USED TO KNOW THE MISDEMEANOR S.

04:15:47.932 --> 04:15:51.803
T. DATA WHILE I WAS IN. HOW

04:15:51.869 --> 04:15:55.573
BEFORE 47% OF THE WHO WORK. FOR

04:15:55.640 --> 04:15:57.942
A ADOPTED DOWN IS TO CALL AND

04:15:58.009 --> 04:15:59.477
CONFIRM AND BECOME FELONY ICE

04:15:59.544 --> 04:16:02.714
TEA HAD NO CLINICAL SERVICES NOT

04:16:02.780 --> 04:16:05.016
A SINGLE MEDICAL ENCOUNTER SIX

04:16:05.083 --> 04:16:08.052
MONTHS BEFORE FOR THE SIX MONTHS

04:16:08.119 --> 04:16:08.820
BEFORE THEIR ARREST SO THIS

04:16:08.886 --> 04:16:11.489
NOTION THAT. SO MANY INDIVIDUALS

04:16:11.556 --> 04:16:13.624
DIDN'T HAVE ANY ACCESS TO CARE

04:16:13.691 --> 04:16:15.993
ISRAEL AND SO THE HOPE IS THAT

04:16:16.060 --> 04:16:18.429
WE MAKE SURE INDIVIDUALS WHO

04:16:18.496 --> 04:16:20.598
BEFORE THEY GO INTO THE CRIMINAL

04:16:20.665 --> 04:16:21.799
COURT PROCESS HI THERE IS A

04:16:21.866 --> 04:16:24.669
MISDEMEANOR OR A FELONY WE HAVE

04:16:24.736 --> 04:16:26.037
A CHANCE TO CHANGE THE DATA

04:16:26.104 --> 04:16:27.638
POINTS AND ENSURE SOME OF THE

04:16:27.705 --> 04:16:29.574
MOST. VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS GET

04:16:29.640 --> 04:16:31.075
THE CARE THEY NEED EARLIER

04:16:31.142 --> 04:16:34.112
THANKS- ALL RIGHT AT A SEVE

04:16:34.178 --> 04:16:36.180
MICHELLE COMPARES FETCHES AND

04:16:36.247 --> 04:16:38.750
WAVING US THROUGH A LOT OF TIMES

04:16:38.816 --> 04:16:40.384
I'M HERE FOR IF YOU LIKE I'LL

04:16:40.451 --> 04:16:42.253
GIVE HER A CHANCE TO. GRAB

04:16:42.320 --> 04:16:43.054
STRATEGIST SOME OF THE QUESTIONS

04:16:43.121 --> 04:16:45.056
THAT CAME UP HERE AND THEN I

04:16:45.123 --> 04:16:47.058
MIGHT Q. DOCTORS ARE TECHNICALLY

04:16:47.125 --> 04:16:49.527
TO RESPOND THANK YOU DR PAN AM

04:16:49.594 --> 04:16:50.862
MICHELLE AND I WITH THE COUNTY

04:16:50.928 --> 04:16:51.796
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS

04:16:51.863 --> 04:16:54.165
ASSOC GEN AND ON THAT POINT I

04:16:54.232 --> 04:16:55.733
THINK IT DOES SPEAK TO SOME OF

04:16:55.800 --> 04:16:56.968
THE OTHER ELEMENTS THAT I'VE

04:16:57.034 --> 04:16:58.936
BEEN ANXIOUS TO SERVE TIME IN

04:16:59.003 --> 04:17:01.906
ON- ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO

04:17:01.973 --> 04:17:05.843
FLAG IS THAT. MUCH OF THE WORK

04:17:05.910 --> 04:17:11.482
THAT WE DO AND TO BE HERE. NOT

04:17:11.549 --> 04:17:13.151
UNDER MEDIC UNDER PRIVATE AND-

04:17:13.217 --> 04:17:14.252
THERE WE NEED TO BE CHANGES AT

04:17:14.318 --> 04:17:15.787
THE FEDERAL LEVEL INCLUDING AT

04:17:15.853 --> 04:17:17.889
THE STATE LEVEL TO ALLOW FOR US

04:17:17.955 --> 04:17:19.490
TO REIMBURSE FOR THESE SERVICES

04:17:19.557 --> 04:17:21.726
AND I THIN ONE OF THE BIG FAULT

04:17:21.793 --> 04:17:23.561
LINES HERE IS THAT WE HAVE A

04:17:23.628 --> 04:17:24.796
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

04:17:24.862 --> 04:17:26.697
SERVICES WHO MANAGES INSURANCE.

04:17:26.764 --> 04:17:28.633
MAY PULL INSURANCE CLAIMS NAY

04:17:28.699 --> 04:17:30.635
SAY AHA. COUNTIES HAVE BEEN

04:17:30.701 --> 04:17:31.669
NEGLIGENT THEY'VE DONE NOTHING

04:17:31.736 --> 04:17:35.173
HERE. WHEN IN FACT WHAT HAPPENS

04:17:35.239 --> 04:17:37.608
UNDER CARE COURT S. IS WITH THE

04:17:37.675 --> 04:17:40.278
CASE TODAY IS THAT THE TIME THAT

04:17:40.344 --> 04:17:43.047
WE SPEND OUT IN THE FIELD

04:17:43.114 --> 04:17:45.817
WORKING TO ENGAGE SOMEBODY WILL

04:17:45.883 --> 04:17:46.818
NEVER BE SEEN AS A MEDICAL

04:17:46.884 --> 04:17:49.353
CLAIM. SO THERE WILL BE NO CHILL

04:17:49.420 --> 04:17:50.154
THERE WILL BE NO EVIDENCE OF THE

04:17:50.221 --> 04:17:52.256
WORK THAT HAPPENED THAT WE

04:17:52.323 --> 04:17:52.990
LARGELY FUND THROUGH AN HSA

04:17:53.057 --> 04:17:54.992
DOLLARS. THEY'RE ALSO HAS

04:17:55.059 --> 04:17:57.361
SENATOR EGGMAN KNOWS. NOT WELL

04:17:57.428 --> 04:17:59.831
ACCOUNTED FOR. AND SO WE ARE

04:17:59.897 --> 04:18:02.333
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DEGREE

04:18:02.400 --> 04:18:04.735
OF THE OUTREACH SERVICES THEY

04:18:04.802 --> 04:18:06.037
WERE GONNA HAVE TO DO UNDER CARE

04:18:06.103 --> 04:18:08.206
COURT BECAUSE NONE OF IT IS

04:18:08.272 --> 04:18:08.873
COMPULSORY WE ARE LITERALLY

04:18:08.940 --> 04:18:10.441
GOING TO HAVE TO GO. SEARCHING

04:18:10.508 --> 04:18:13.144
FOR PEOPLE. AND THEN BEGGING FOR

04:18:13.211 --> 04:18:15.246
THEM TO COME AND WORK WITH US

04:18:15.313 --> 04:18:17.281
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO

REIMBURSED UNDER MEDICARE. AND

04:18:40.238 --> 04:18:42.006
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT WITH THE

04:18:42.073 --> 04:18:44.275
MONEY THAT WE HAVE TODAY WE'VE

04:18:44.342 --> 04:18:45.409

HELP REIMBURSEMENT SO- JUST

04:18:56.954 --> 04:18:58.256
WANTED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT SOME OF

04:18:58.322 --> 04:19:00.825

WITHOUT GETTING TO ALL OF THE

04:23:07.238 --> 04:23:08.973
COMPLEXITY IS WHICH I THINK MANY

04:23:09.039 --> 04:23:10.141
OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS IN

04:23:10.207 --> 04:23:11.509
COLLEAGUES UNDERSTAND BOTH

04:23:11.575 --> 04:23:13.244
WITHIN GOVERNMENT AND OUTSIDE OF

04:23:13.310 --> 04:23:14.678
GOVERNMENT BUT THERE'S A

04:23:14.745 --> 04:23:15.980
COMMITMENT TO LOOK AT THAT TO

OUR POLICY COMMENTS THE

04:23:32.897 --> 04:23:34.798
AMENDMENTS SOME HOPING THAT

04:23:34.865 --> 04:23:36.767
THOSE CAN- THOSE WOULD BE

04:23:36.834 --> 04:23:42.139
ADDRESSED IN THE FUTURE- AS.

04:23:42.206 --> 04:23:43.741
WELL AND THE SYSTEM. AND THEN.

04:23:43.807 --> 04:23:46.277
SO WE'VE HAD- WE TALKED ABOUT-

04:23:46.343 --> 04:23:47.578

04:23:54.985 --> 04:23:55.920
TO CONVERSATION WORKING ON THE

04:23:55.986 --> 04:23:57.388
ONE. LANGUAGE THE LANGUAGE THERE

04:23:57.454 --> 04:23:59.423
AND THEN I GUESS FINALLY. AND I

04:23:59.490 --> 04:24:00.124
DO APPRECIATE THE PREVIOUS

04:24:00.191 --> 04:24:01.392
DISCUSSION ABOUT. THE

04:24:01.458 --> 04:24:02.826
VOLUNTARINESS ARE LACK OF

04:24:02.893 --> 04:24:03.894
VOLUNTARINESS AND I KNOW SOME

04:24:03.961 --> 04:24:05.696
QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED AND I

04:24:05.763 --> 04:24:06.864
THINK SOME CONCERNS HAVE BEEN

04:24:06.931 --> 04:24:08.799
RAISED BY SOME OF THE ADVOCATES

04:24:08.866 --> 04:24:10.301
ABOUT- NOW I THINK THERE. ARE

04:24:10.367 --> 04:24:13.103
TIMES WHERE AND JOBS I SUPPORT

04:24:13.170 --> 04:24:15.506
LAURA'S LAW AND STUFF- SO I KNOW

04:24:15.573 --> 04:24:17.241
MAKES SOME PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH

04:24:17.308 --> 04:24:17.942
THAT I THINK THERE ARE SOME

04:24:18.008 --> 04:24:20.878
CIRCUMSTANCES- BUT ESPECIALLY.

04:24:20.945 --> 04:24:23.080
BUT IT'S ALSO A LAST RESORT AND

04:24:23.147 --> 04:24:24.415
I THINK IT I THINK EVERYONE

04:24:24.481 --> 04:24:26.584
AGREES EVEN OF US ARE STILL-

04:24:26.650 --> 04:24:27.818
JUST WANNA BE SURE WE HAVE

04:24:27.885 --> 04:24:29.720
CLARITY IN THE LANGUAGE ABOUT.

04:24:29.787 --> 04:24:31.722
WHATEVER WOULD TRIGGER ARE MAYBE

04:24:31.789 --> 04:24:33.490
NOT IN THE CARE COURT GREAT LIFT

04:24:33.557 --> 04:24:36.093
THE SITUATION BUT- AGAIN TO BE

04:24:36.160 --> 04:24:37.795
SURE WE RESPECT THE AUTONOMY OF

04:24:37.861 --> 04:24:39.897
PATIENTS AND ADULTS ONLY TRULY

04:24:39.964 --> 04:24:45.169
A- LAST RESORT. WHERE THERE'D BE

04:24:45.236 --> 04:24:46.170
CIRCUMSTANCE WHAT THEIR DAD LOOK

04:24:46.237 --> 04:24:57.147
ACTUALLY. RECORDER.

04:24:57.214 --> 04:24:57.715
FIVE MAKE DECISIONS WE JUST

04:24:57.781 --> 04:24:59.850
DON'T AGREE WITH AND- YOU KNOW

04:24:59.917 --> 04:25:02.152
AND SO FORTH AND WE HAVE TO

04:25:02.219 --> 04:25:04.088
RESPECT THAT RIGHT. SO OKAY SO I

04:25:04.154 --> 04:25:06.090
SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS

04:25:06.156 --> 04:25:08.392
I'D LIKE TO SEE IS THAT WITHIN

04:25:08.459 --> 04:25:09.026
MY PROPOSED FORMAL AMENDMENTS-

04:25:14.865 --> 04:25:16.133
REALLY HARD TO WORK OUT. SO BUT

04:25:16.200 --> 04:25:18.769
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS I'D

04:25:18.836 --> 04:25:20.070
LIKE TO SEE MOVING FORWARD. AND

04:25:20.137 --> 04:25:20.904
I'M HOPING THAT- YOU CAN

04:25:20.971 --> 04:25:22.273
COMMITTED TO DOING THAT- THIS

04:25:22.339 --> 04:25:27.578
IS. A SPORT. YES AT THE START.

04:25:27.645 --> 04:25:29.113
RIGHT YEAH I FOLLOW UP WITH

04:25:29.179 --> 04:25:32.883
DOCTOR GALLAGHER. DR AS WE HAVE

04:25:32.950 --> 04:25:37.221
JUST IN THE PAST AND I KNOW YOU

04:25:37.288 --> 04:25:39.923
KNOW MUCH BETTER THAN I. THE- I

04:25:39.990 --> 04:25:41.725
MET BACK IN THE EARLY NINETEEN

04:25:41.792 --> 04:25:43.294
NINETIES RESULTED IN FUNDING

04:25:43.360 --> 04:25:44.962
INEQUITY IN OUR COUNTIES NORTH

04:25:45.029 --> 04:25:46.463
OF SELF SERVING COASTAL TO

04:25:46.530 --> 04:25:50.134
INLAND. AND I'M CONCERNED A

04:25:50.200 --> 04:25:51.402
LITTLE BIT I'M STILL SUPPORTING

04:25:51.468 --> 04:25:54.438
THIS. BOTH FEET IN BUT I AM

04:25:54.505 --> 04:25:57.074
CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT

04:25:57.141 --> 04:25:59.276
THE IT SOUNDS LIKE THE COUNTY'S

04:25:59.343 --> 04:26:00.711
EFFORTS IN THE OBLIGATIONS OF

04:26:00.778 --> 04:26:03.914
COUNTIES. WILL NOT LIKELY BE

04:26:03.981 --> 04:26:06.450
REIMBURSED AT LEAST UNDER THE

04:26:06.517 --> 04:26:09.987
CURRENT RULES. AND I'M CONCERNED

04:26:10.054 --> 04:26:12.723
ABOUT WHERE THE COUNTIES GET THE

04:26:12.790 --> 04:26:14.658
FUNDING. TO DO THE KIND OF

04:26:14.725 --> 04:26:17.328
THINGS THAT ARE CONTEMPLATED BY

04:26:17.394 --> 04:26:21.131
THE CARE ACT OBVIOUSLY VALUABLE

04:26:21.198 --> 04:26:22.333
AND ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS THAT

04:26:22.399 --> 04:26:24.668
NEED IT PERFORMED BUT OF COURSE.

04:26:24.735 --> 04:26:27.037
SOMEBODY HAS TO FIND THE MONEY

04:26:27.104 --> 04:26:31.141
TO COVER THE COSTS. IT IS AND I

04:26:31.208 --> 04:26:32.710
KNOW WE'RE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS

04:26:32.776 --> 04:26:34.812
AND WE'LL HAVE THIS CONVERSATION

04:26:34.878 --> 04:26:37.748
IN A DIFFERENT FORM. BLOOD IT

04:26:37.815 --> 04:26:40.451
WILL THE LIGHTS WHICH BRIEFLY

04:26:40.517 --> 04:26:43.487
DONE ON THE CARE ACT. BEFORE WE

04:26:43.554 --> 04:26:46.990
DETERMINE WHAT THE SOURCE OF THE

04:26:47.057 --> 04:26:48.792
FUNDING WILL BE FOR COUNTIES

04:26:48.859 --> 04:26:51.028
PARTICULARLY THOSE COUNTIES THAT

04:26:51.095 --> 04:26:53.230
ARE UNDER RESOURCE NOW SOME OF

04:26:53.297 --> 04:26:55.232
THEM MAY BE EXPERIENCING A

04:26:55.299 --> 04:26:57.801
SURPLUS OF SOME SORT AND FOR THE

04:26:57.868 --> 04:27:01.138
FIRST TIME IN YEARS BUT I'M SURE

04:27:01.205 --> 04:27:03.140
THAT SURPLUS WON'T GO VERY FAR-

04:27:03.207 --> 04:27:05.609
IF THERE'S NOT ANY ADDITIONAL

04:27:05.676 --> 04:27:09.947
MONEY FLOWING. TO THEM. CAN YOU

04:27:10.013 --> 04:27:13.517
. PROVIDE ANY- WARMTH TO ME ON

04:27:13.584 --> 04:27:16.620
THAT SUBJECT I WILL TO DO MY

04:27:16.687 --> 04:27:19.323
BEST TO ASSIST YOU AND I HAVE

04:27:19.390 --> 04:27:20.124
ENGAGED ON THE SAME CONVERSATION

04:27:20.190 --> 04:27:22.092
IN THE PAST THE FIRST THING TO

04:27:22.159 --> 04:27:24.328
SAY IS THE COMMITMENT WE TALKED

04:27:24.395 --> 04:27:25.863
ABOUT IT EARLIER ABOUT WHAT'S

04:27:25.929 --> 04:27:26.930
BEING WORKED OUT IN TERMS OF

04:27:26.997 --> 04:27:28.832
INVESTMENTS GO INTO SOME OF THE

04:27:28.899 --> 04:27:31.535
NEW COMPONENTS OF THE CARE COURT

04:27:31.602 --> 04:27:34.071
PLAN THE SUPPORTER ROLE AS AN

04:27:34.138 --> 04:27:36.240
EXAMPLE IS SOMETHING THAT. WE'RE

04:27:36.306 --> 04:27:38.442
WORKING ON EXACTLY WHAT THE

04:27:38.509 --> 04:27:41.044
FUNDING THE MATTER THE MECHANISM

04:27:41.111 --> 04:27:42.146
AND HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK BUT

04:27:42.212 --> 04:27:44.047
THAT WILL BE AUGMENTED FATHER

04:27:44.114 --> 04:27:46.083
AUGMENTATIONS ARE ALSO EXPECTED

04:27:46.150 --> 04:27:47.951
WORKING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE

04:27:48.018 --> 04:27:49.853
ARE COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS

04:27:49.920 --> 04:27:52.055
MIGHT BE ON SOME OF THE OTHER

04:27:52.122 --> 04:27:53.223
DEPARTMENTS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL

04:27:53.290 --> 04:27:54.658
THAT MIGHT BE INVOLVED HERE BUT

04:27:54.725 --> 04:27:56.794
I WILL UNDERSCORE I THINK THIS

04:27:56.860 --> 04:27:57.995
WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN SENATOR

04:27:58.061 --> 04:28:00.164
ADMINS COMMENTS THIS DOES NOT

04:28:00.230 --> 04:28:02.299
ADDRESS THE REALIGNMENT IN

04:28:02.366 --> 04:28:04.201
EQUITY THAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING

04:28:04.268 --> 04:28:06.336
HISTORIC OVERTIME I DON'T THINK

04:28:06.403 --> 04:28:08.839
THAT I HAVE THE TOOLS TODAY TO

04:28:08.906 --> 04:28:10.507
ADDRESS THAT FULLY FOR YOU BUT

04:28:10.574 --> 04:28:12.476
THE IDEA THAT. THE RESOURCES IN

04:28:12.543 --> 04:28:17.181
COUNTIES COULD BE AND MAYBE SOME

04:28:17.247 --> 04:28:20.717
OF US BELIEVE SHOULD BE DEPLOYED

04:28:20.784 --> 04:28:22.853
TO. WE ARE. EVEN FIRST A

04:28:22.920 --> 04:28:24.221
PRIORITY I THINK IS PART OF WHAT

04:28:24.288 --> 04:28:26.857
WE ARE FOCUSED ON AND SO- MAKING

04:28:26.924 --> 04:28:28.859
SURE THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING

04:28:28.926 --> 04:28:31.261
COUNTIES BEING CLEAR. SAID THIS

04:28:31.328 --> 04:28:33.163
IS A POPULATION OF PRIORITY FOR

04:28:33.230 --> 04:28:35.165
CALIFORNIA AND ENSURING THAT

04:28:35.232 --> 04:28:37.234
THOSE DOLLARS- EVEN THOUGH THEY

04:28:37.301 --> 04:28:39.703
MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO DO

04:28:39.770 --> 04:28:43.006
EVERYTHING- THE HEAD THAT ARE.

04:28:43.073 --> 04:28:45.242
BILL THAT COUNTY MADE. TO DO

04:28:45.309 --> 04:28:46.610
FOUR FIVE EXPECT THEMSELVES TO

04:28:46.677 --> 04:28:48.645
DO THIS IS A PRIORITY POPULATION

04:28:48.712 --> 04:28:50.848
THAT THOSE DOLLARS SHOULD BE.

04:28:50.914 --> 04:28:52.716
SUPPORTING AND THEN SIMILARLY

04:28:52.783 --> 04:28:56.420
THE CONCEPT AROUND HOUSING TO

04:28:56.487 --> 04:28:57.287
MAKE SURE THOSE INVEST SO WE

04:28:57.354 --> 04:28:59.490
TALKED ABOUT THAT HAVE GONE INTO

04:28:59.556 --> 04:29:01.625
THE STATE BUDGETS OVER THE LAST

04:29:01.692 --> 04:29:02.826
TWO YEARS THAT ARE PROPOSED TO

04:29:02.893 --> 04:29:04.995
AUGMENT. THIS YEAR ONE POINT

04:29:05.062 --> 04:29:06.563
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN BEHAVIOR

04:29:06.630 --> 04:29:08.832
HOPE BRIDGE HOUSING AS PART OF

04:29:08.899 --> 04:29:10.234
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET

04:29:10.300 --> 04:29:11.668
REALLY TARGETING HOUSING

04:29:11.735 --> 04:29:15.138
SOLUTIONS FOR EXACTLY BUT NOT.

04:29:15.205 --> 04:29:17.541
ONLY FOR BUT INCLUDING THE CARE

04:29:17.608 --> 04:29:19.176
COURT POPULATION THAT WE

04:29:19.243 --> 04:29:21.011
ANTICIPATE BEING REFERRED WELL I

04:29:21.078 --> 04:29:23.814
DIDN'T INTEND TO BEAT YOU UP ON

04:29:23.881 --> 04:29:25.015
MENTAL HEALTH REALIGNMENT THAT'S

04:29:25.082 --> 04:29:28.919
A PROBLEM THAT MAY EVEN BE. AT

04:29:28.986 --> 04:29:30.487
LEAST. MODERN TIME BUT BUT IT

04:29:30.554 --> 04:29:32.189
DOES HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT IN

04:29:32.256 --> 04:29:34.358
SOME COUNTIES IN SOME REGIONS

04:29:34.424 --> 04:29:36.627
THE- THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

04:29:36.693 --> 04:29:39.463
AVAILABLE IS- REMAINS WILL FEEL

04:29:39.530 --> 04:29:41.298
WOEFULLY INADEQUATE TO SERVICE

04:29:41.365 --> 04:29:43.300
THE POPULATION GROWS SINCE WE

04:29:43.367 --> 04:29:44.768
WERE DEALING WITH. MENTAL HEALTH

04:29:44.835 --> 04:29:46.069
REALIGNMENT AND IT IT IT

04:29:46.136 --> 04:29:49.339
HIGHLIGHTS THE SITUATION WHERE

04:29:49.406 --> 04:29:50.507
SOME COUNTIES MAY NEED A LITTLE

04:29:50.574 --> 04:29:52.809
HELP- TO DO THESE THINGS

04:29:52.876 --> 04:29:53.877
ASSOCIATED WITH CARE COURT

04:29:53.944 --> 04:29:55.212
BECAUSE THERE SIMPLY ISN'T

04:29:55.279 --> 04:29:57.481
ENOUGH MONEY BETWEEN PROP SIXTY

04:29:57.548 --> 04:29:58.515
THREE AND- MENTAL HEALTH

04:29:58.582 --> 04:30:01.518
REALIGNMENT OF TO FUND WHAT. THE

CONVERSATIONS IS THE BUDGET

04:30:08.625 --> 04:30:09.726

CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO WORK. TO

04:30:11.929 --> 04:30:13.196
MAKE TO GO TO PROVIDE THE

04:30:13.263 --> 04:30:14.798

NUMBER. A LOT OF LONG LIST OF

04:35:49.299 --> 04:35:50.700
ISSUES THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE

THE SPORADIC NATURE OF MENTAL

04:36:04.514 --> 04:36:08.852
HEALTH SERVICES- AND THE LACK OF

04:36:08.919 --> 04:36:09.953
ONGOING FUNDING AT THE STATE

04:36:10.020 --> 04:36:13.423

TO REMEDY. AT LEAST THE INTENT-

04:36:17.594 --> 04:36:19.529

04:36:24.401 --> 04:36:26.269
NOT HAVE THE LEVEL OF DETAIL

04:36:26.336 --> 04:36:30.573

THE COMMITTEE THOUGH THAT. THAT

THIS WORK IN PROGRESS. IS

04:36:45.956 --> 04:36:49.192
NECESSARY TO MOVE AS WERE HAVING

04:36:49.259 --> 04:36:49.826
THESE OTHER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

04:36:49.893 --> 04:36:52.195
CARE COURTS. OR THIS OTHER KIND

04:36:52.262 --> 04:36:53.296
OF TREATMENT THAT WE'RE

04:36:53.363 --> 04:36:55.932
PROPOSING. HI MY MINOR TO HAVE.

04:36:55.999 --> 04:36:57.701
CENTER EGGMAN HAS BEEN FRANKLY

04:36:57.767 --> 04:37:00.103
LEADING. THIS CONVERSATION AS AS

04:37:00.170 --> 04:37:03.406
OUR PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR HERE AND

04:37:03.473 --> 04:37:04.674
- THE BASIC PIECES OF THE BILL

04:37:04.741 --> 04:37:06.309
IS THAT ONE TIMES NOT GOING TO

04:37:06.376 --> 04:37:08.511
DO IT WHEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE

04:37:08.578 --> 04:37:10.013
OF SOMEBODY. FINANCIALLY FOR THE

04:37:10.080 --> 04:37:11.748
REST OF THEIR LIFE. AND PEOPLE

04:37:11.815 --> 04:37:13.583
WHO ARE. DISABLED IN THE STATE

04:37:13.650 --> 04:37:15.251
OF CALIFORNIA DUE TO A

04:37:15.318 --> 04:37:17.053
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY HAVE

04:37:17.120 --> 04:37:20.790
THAT GUARANTEED RIGHT. AND WHEN

04:37:20.857 --> 04:37:22.092
YOU LOOK AT THE REIMBURSEMENT

04:37:22.158 --> 04:37:24.527
RATES THAT. SOMEONE RECEIVED FOR

04:37:24.594 --> 04:37:25.495
THEIR INTELLECTUAL OR

04:37:25.562 --> 04:37:28.031
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY PER BED

04:37:28.098 --> 04:37:29.933
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A NINE

04:37:30.000 --> 04:37:31.034
THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH NINETY

04:37:31.101 --> 04:37:33.336
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH.

04:37:33.403 --> 04:37:34.304
THE CURRENT BOARDING CARE

04:37:34.371 --> 04:37:37.841
LEVELS- A SUBSTANTIALLY LESS

04:37:37.907 --> 04:37:39.609
THAN THAT AND WE'RE THOUSANDS

04:37:39.676 --> 04:37:41.845
THE BED SHORT. AND I THINK THIS

04:37:41.911 --> 04:37:43.446
GOVERNOR'S BEEN BOLD IN THIS

04:37:43.513 --> 04:37:45.281
WITH THIS ONE TIME FUNDING

04:37:45.348 --> 04:37:47.183
PROPOSAL TO LOOK AT BEHAVIORAL

04:37:47.250 --> 04:37:48.118
HEALTH AND TO LOOK AT

04:37:48.184 --> 04:37:51.121
INFRASTRUCTURE- BUT- WHAT WE'RE

04:37:51.187 --> 04:37:51.921
TRYING TO DO WITH THIS

04:37:51.988 --> 04:37:53.823
LEGISLATION. IS OFFER A

04:37:53.890 --> 04:37:56.292
DIFFERENT WAY IN- NOT JUST

04:37:56.359 --> 04:37:58.628
LOOKING AT THE TOOLS OF WHAT

04:37:58.695 --> 04:38:01.931
CARE. WOULD DO- BUT IN CHANGING

04:38:01.998 --> 04:38:03.533
THE UNDERLYING STRUCTURE AROUND

04:38:03.600 --> 04:38:07.771
THE PROGRAM. NO I HAVE. IN OUR

04:38:07.837 --> 04:38:11.708
DISCUSSIONS MISTER CHAIR- YOU

04:38:11.775 --> 04:38:14.411
KNOW I OFFERED SOME SOME IDEAS

04:38:14.477 --> 04:38:17.180
THAT SOUNDED LIKE MIGHT

04:38:17.247 --> 04:38:18.982
ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE CONCERNS

04:38:19.049 --> 04:38:20.083
MAYBE THE COMMITTEE OR MEMBERS

04:38:20.150 --> 04:38:22.018
OF THE COMMITTEE ABOUT.

04:38:22.085 --> 04:38:23.453
LITIGATION RISK AROUND THIS

04:38:23.520 --> 04:38:25.188
LEGISLATION IF YOU CAUGHT A FIRE

04:38:25.255 --> 04:38:28.658
RIGHT IN LAW TO GUARANTEE

04:38:28.725 --> 04:38:30.827
TREATMENT HOUSING. WITH EVERYONE

04:38:30.894 --> 04:38:32.996
JUST START SUING EACH OTHER TO

04:38:33.063 --> 04:38:34.764
LOCK IN THAT RIGHT. COULD THE

04:38:34.831 --> 04:38:36.733
COUNTIES TO THE STATE. COULD

04:38:36.800 --> 04:38:41.271
PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS TO COUNTIES-

04:38:41.337 --> 04:38:42.505
YOU KNOW COULD INDIVIDUALS

04:38:42.572 --> 04:38:44.874
THEMSELVES SEEK RECOURSE. I

04:38:44.941 --> 04:38:47.177
DON'T WANT TO GO THERE YET WITH

04:38:47.243 --> 04:38:48.478
THIS LEGISLATION SO YOU KNOW

04:38:48.545 --> 04:38:51.047
WHAT IF THE BILL DOES MOVE FOR

04:38:51.114 --> 04:38:52.415
TODAY I JUST WANT TO ASSURE

04:38:52.482 --> 04:38:56.152
COMMITTEE THE CHAIR. THAT WE

04:38:56.219 --> 04:38:57.320
WANT TO PRESCRIBE THIS

04:38:57.387 --> 04:38:59.389
LEGISLATION WE WANT TO

04:38:59.456 --> 04:39:01.624
COORDINATE OFTEN CONSTRAIN IT-

04:39:01.691 --> 04:39:03.726
IN A WAY THAT. WOULD NOT GIVE

04:39:03.793 --> 04:39:05.728
ANYONE A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE RIGHT

04:39:05.795 --> 04:39:09.332
OF ACTION- WOULD NOT OFFER THAT

04:39:09.399 --> 04:39:11.768
THAT ABILITY TO. TO SAY STALL

04:39:11.835 --> 04:39:14.671
OUT OR DECIDE THROUGH THE COURT

04:39:14.737 --> 04:39:16.506
SYSTEM AS OPPOSED TO THE BUDGET

04:39:16.573 --> 04:39:19.042
PROCESS EXACTLY HOW- WE GET

04:39:19.109 --> 04:39:20.643
TREATMENT AND HOUSING TO

04:39:20.710 --> 04:39:23.146
EVERYBODY WHO NEEDS IT. BUT I DO

04:39:23.213 --> 04:39:25.949
THINK THERE'S POWER IN CODIFYING

04:39:26.015 --> 04:39:28.518
IN CALIFORNIA LAW THAT THIS

04:39:28.585 --> 04:39:30.620
OUGHT TO BE A RIGHT. THE PEOPLE

04:39:30.687 --> 04:39:36.226
WHO ARE SUFFERING OR HAVE. THE

04:39:36.292 --> 04:39:37.393
GUARANTEE THAT GOES BEYOND A TWO

04:39:37.460 --> 04:39:41.297
YEAR CYCLE. ENDS I APPRECIATE

04:39:41.364 --> 04:39:43.666
THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT THE BILL

04:39:43.733 --> 04:39:45.869
. ENTER A DEBATE THIS BUT- JUST

04:39:45.935 --> 04:39:47.937
FOLLOWING ON AFTER THAT LAST

04:39:48.004 --> 04:39:50.540
LEGISLATION AS- I'M NOT SAYING

04:39:50.607 --> 04:39:54.244
THIS IS THE SOLUTION- I THINK

04:39:54.310 --> 04:39:56.246
THERE COULD BE A MORE TAILORED

04:39:56.312 --> 04:39:57.747
APPROACH WE COULD PROBABLY SOLVE

04:39:57.814 --> 04:39:58.414
SOME OF THESE ISSUES THROUGH THE

04:39:58.481 --> 04:40:00.483
BUDGET PROCESS BUT WHEN WE WHEN

04:40:00.550 --> 04:40:01.818
WE HEAR ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

04:40:01.885 --> 04:40:04.687
EXPIRING TOWARDS. SOME ASSURANCE

04:40:04.754 --> 04:40:06.789
THAT HEARD THE WORD ASSURANCE.

04:40:06.856 --> 04:40:08.725
LET'S PUT THAT INSURANCE. LET'S

04:40:08.791 --> 04:40:10.693
PUT LET'S PUT OUR- OUR MOUTHS

04:40:10.760 --> 04:40:13.363
WERE MONIES. RIGHT LET'S

04:40:13.429 --> 04:40:14.731
ACTUALLY LOCK THAT INTO LAW

04:40:14.797 --> 04:40:16.900
SOMEHOW THE SAME WAY WE DO WITH

04:40:16.966 --> 04:40:18.835
THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER. WHERE

04:40:18.902 --> 04:40:20.870
WE SET IN STATE LAW EVERYONE HAS

04:40:20.937 --> 04:40:22.105
A RIGHT TO SAFE DRINKING WATER

04:40:22.172 --> 04:40:23.773
IN CALIFORNIA. WE DIDN'T ALLOW

04:40:23.840 --> 04:40:25.608
PEOPLE TO GO TO EVERYBODY AND

04:40:25.675 --> 04:40:28.411
LOCK THAT IN WE NEGOTIATED

04:40:28.478 --> 04:40:30.380
SOLUTION OVER COMING YEARS. BUT

04:40:30.446 --> 04:40:33.416
WE PUT OUR INTENT. INTO THE

04:40:33.483 --> 04:40:34.684
CALIFORNIA CODE AND THAT HAS

04:40:34.751 --> 04:40:36.819
POWER AND I HOPE THAT YOU KNOW

04:40:36.886 --> 04:40:38.521
IN OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH ACLU

04:40:38.588 --> 04:40:41.224

TABLE AND TRY TO FIND SOME

04:40:54.070 --> 04:40:55.205

CREATE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

04:51:36.545 --> 04:51:37.513
OR THAT IT WOULDN'T ALLOW

04:51:37.580 --> 04:51:39.181

THEY'RE NOT OFFICIAL COMMITTEE

04:51:57.166 --> 04:51:58.067
AMENDMENTS AND WE'RE NOT GOING

04:51:58.133 --> 04:52:00.202

COMMUNITY I WON'T BE BRINGING UP

04:52:09.211 --> 04:52:10.980
ON THE FLOOR. OUR TRYING TO MOVE

04:52:11.046 --> 04:52:13.182
IT OUT OF OUR HOUSE WITHOUT THAT

04:52:13.249 --> 04:52:16.719
KIND OF- GUARDRAIL IN THERE TO

04:52:16.785 --> 04:52:19.355
REALLY CLARIFY THAT. DESPERATION

04:52:19.421 --> 04:52:23.525
HERE. AND NOT LITIGATION- OKAY

04:52:23.592 --> 04:52:25.494
SO YOU WERE GOING TO AMEND THE

04:52:25.561 --> 04:52:29.365
BILL. TO NOT MAKE IT A

04:52:29.431 --> 04:52:30.900
GUARANTEED RATE IS TO AM I

04:52:30.966 --> 04:52:32.768
UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY I WOULD

04:52:32.835 --> 04:52:35.237
AMEND THE BILL TO NOT AUTHORIZE

04:52:35.304 --> 04:52:35.938
A PRIVATE OR PUBLIC RIGHT OF

04:52:36.005 --> 04:52:39.241
ACTION OKAY- I GET THAT THERE'S

04:52:39.308 --> 04:52:40.542
A- OKAY THAT'S IT I JUST WANT

04:52:40.609 --> 04:52:44.280
ENGINE SURE OKAY. AND SO- WE

04:52:44.346 --> 04:52:47.816
HEARD SOME COMMENTS ABOUT-

04:52:47.883 --> 04:52:49.184
HEARING THE PREVIOUS BILL

04:52:49.251 --> 04:52:50.152
OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE HERE FOR A

04:52:50.219 --> 04:52:52.588
LARGE AREA MOST OF THE TESTIMONY

04:52:52.655 --> 04:52:54.089
IN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A

04:52:54.156 --> 04:52:57.293
SHORTAGE OF- PROVIDERS AND WE

04:52:57.359 --> 04:52:58.694
CERTAINLY HAVE A SHORTAGE OF

04:52:58.761 --> 04:53:00.596
HOUSING OPTIONS FOR THIS

04:53:00.663 --> 04:53:04.333
PARTICULAR AND COMMUNITY SO. I

04:53:04.400 --> 04:53:06.869
GUESS I'M WONDERING HOW. YOU

04:53:06.936 --> 04:53:08.504
PLAN TO ADDRESS THAT I MEAN

04:53:08.570 --> 04:53:10.472
BECAUSE MAKING A STATEMENT DO

04:53:10.539 --> 04:53:12.107
YOU THINK IT'S A RIGHT FOR

04:53:12.174 --> 04:53:13.442
HOUSING IN A RIGHT FOR SERVICES

04:53:13.509 --> 04:53:14.476
IS ONE THING THE FOLLOWING

04:53:14.543 --> 04:53:15.978
THROUGH ON THAT IS SOMETHING

04:53:16.045 --> 04:53:17.680
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SO WHAT IS

04:53:17.746 --> 04:53:20.582
WHAT IS THE PLAN TO BRING THAT

04:53:20.649 --> 04:53:22.985
TO FRUITION. IN YOUR BILL. I

04:53:23.052 --> 04:53:26.422
MEAN I BASE THE LAST DEBATE- I

04:53:26.488 --> 04:53:28.223
YOU KNOW I HOPE THAT THROUGH THE

04:53:28.290 --> 04:53:29.024
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND NOT A

04:53:29.091 --> 04:53:31.026
SEE THROUGH THE JUDICIAL PROCESS

04:53:31.093 --> 04:53:31.927
TO RECTIFY THAT NOW THAT WOULD

04:53:31.994 --> 04:53:34.029
BE MY HOPE I MEAN. THE ANALOG

04:53:34.096 --> 04:53:37.333
BEING ON THE- CLEAN WATER-

04:53:37.399 --> 04:53:41.370
ISSUE. CODIFIED IN TWENTY TWELVE

04:53:41.437 --> 04:53:41.904
HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER IN

04:53:41.971 --> 04:53:45.507
CALIFORNIA. TOOK FOR FIVE YEARS

04:53:45.574 --> 04:53:46.375
OF ADVOCACY NOW THERE'S ONGOING

04:53:46.442 --> 04:53:48.177
FUNDING TO DEAL WITH SAFE CLEAN

04:53:48.243 --> 04:53:49.111
DRINKING WATER ON AN ONGOING

04:53:49.178 --> 04:53:52.181
BASIS. SO IT WOULD TAKE A

04:53:52.247 --> 04:53:52.915
SEPARATE ACT BEYOND THIS

04:53:52.982 --> 04:53:54.984
LEGISLATION AYE AYE I WILL

04:53:55.050 --> 04:53:56.051
CONCEDE THAT THIS IS NOT A

04:53:56.118 --> 04:53:59.955
COMPLETE. BILL BUT- I THINK. THE

04:54:00.022 --> 04:54:01.123
PERSON I THINK IS IT FROM A

04:54:01.190 --> 04:54:02.691
VALUES PERSPECTIVE IT'S

04:54:02.758 --> 04:54:04.827
IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL STATE

04:54:04.893 --> 04:54:07.429
THAT. IT'S INSUFFICIENT TO LEAVE

04:54:07.496 --> 04:54:09.798
ANYBODY BEHIND AND THAT. THE

04:54:09.865 --> 04:54:11.834
ENTIRE LEGISLATURE AND THE

04:54:11.900 --> 04:54:13.802
ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE FOCUSED

04:54:13.869 --> 04:54:17.172
ON SUSTAINED ON GOING FUNDING IN

04:54:17.239 --> 04:54:19.808
THAT REGARD SO- IT THE

04:54:19.875 --> 04:54:21.310
DIFFERENCE THOUGH BETWEEN THE

04:54:21.377 --> 04:54:23.679
PREVIOUS SPELLING YOUR BILL IS

04:54:23.746 --> 04:54:25.647
THAT THE PREVIOUS BILL-

04:54:25.714 --> 04:54:27.683
ADDRESSED A VERY SPECIFIC GROUP

04:54:27.750 --> 04:54:29.051
OF PEOPLE GAYS WHO WERE EITHER

04:54:29.118 --> 04:54:30.853
HAD VERY SEVERE. MENTAL HEALTH

04:54:30.919 --> 04:54:33.622
ISSUES WHERE YOUR BILL- DOESN'T

04:54:33.689 --> 04:54:35.357
IDENTIFY THAT THIS IS JUST

04:54:35.424 --> 04:54:38.160
ANYBODY WHO IS- YOU KNOW DOESN'T

04:54:38.227 --> 04:54:41.830
HAVE HOUSING FOR- BECAUSE I

04:54:41.897 --> 04:54:44.033
DON'T SEE I MEAN YOU TALK ABOUT

04:54:44.099 --> 04:54:45.167
MENTAL HEALTH IN HERE BUT THE

04:54:45.234 --> 04:54:49.738
OLD JUST SAYS THAT- LET'S SEE

04:54:49.805 --> 04:54:51.740
HERE. AN INDIVIDUAL WHO LACKS

04:54:51.807 --> 04:54:53.742
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND MENTAL

04:54:53.809 --> 04:54:55.210
HEALTH SERVICES AND IS OTHERWISE

04:54:55.277 --> 04:54:56.478
NOT LIVING SAFELY IN THE

04:54:56.545 --> 04:54:57.646
COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT

04:54:57.713 --> 04:54:58.847
TO RECEIVE YOU KNOW ALL THESE

04:54:58.914 --> 04:55:00.716
DIFFERENT IPS IT'S NOT SPECIFIC

04:55:00.783 --> 04:55:01.717
TO SAY SOMEONE WHO HAS

04:55:01.784 --> 04:55:03.118
SCHIZOPHRENIA OR SOMETHING THIS

04:55:03.185 --> 04:55:04.420
IS JUST ANYBODY WHO'S WHO'S ON

04:55:04.486 --> 04:55:06.188
HOUSE. WELL NO NOT NECESSARILY

04:55:06.255 --> 04:55:08.157
IT HAS TO BE AND IT ENDED AT

04:55:08.223 --> 04:55:09.858
DANGER TO THEMSELVES OKAY SO

04:55:09.925 --> 04:55:11.760
THAT DOESN'T SAY THAT IT WAS NOT

04:55:11.827 --> 04:55:12.961
LIVING SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY

04:55:13.028 --> 04:55:14.863
SO THAT PRECONDITION. AND I

04:55:14.930 --> 04:55:16.899
WOULD I WAS NOT OKAY BUT HOLD ON

04:55:16.965 --> 04:55:19.101
I MEAN YOU KNOW WORK. IT'S THE

04:55:19.168 --> 04:55:21.403
WORDS ARE DEFINITELY IMPORTANT

04:55:21.470 --> 04:55:23.839
AND SO NOT LIVING SAFELY. IS A

04:55:23.906 --> 04:55:26.675
SUBJECTIVE PHRASE RATE IT IS I

04:55:26.742 --> 04:55:30.145
MEAN FRANKLY IT'S NOT SAFE. IT

04:55:30.212 --> 04:55:32.848
REALLY IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES FOR

04:55:32.915 --> 04:55:34.917
A LOT OF PEOPLE IF YOU REALLY

04:55:34.983 --> 04:55:36.885
LOOK AT IT YOU CAN. BE A FACTOR

04:55:36.952 --> 04:55:38.554
IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND

04:55:38.620 --> 04:55:40.289
SAY NO ONE LIVING ON THE STREETS

04:55:40.355 --> 04:55:42.024
EVEN IF THEY'RE IN. SOME

04:55:42.091 --> 04:55:43.759
SECLUDED DO EVERYWHERE THEY'RE

04:55:43.826 --> 04:55:44.393
PROTECTED LET'S SAY IT'S STILL

04:55:44.460 --> 04:55:47.396
NOT SAFE RATE. SO YOU'RE RIGHT

04:55:47.463 --> 04:55:48.764
YOU'RE RIGHT TO PUT YOUR FINGER

04:55:48.831 --> 04:55:50.566
ON THAT ISSUE AND EVEN OUR

04:55:50.632 --> 04:55:52.367

BE WILLING. TO AMEND THE BILL-

04:55:58.006 --> 04:55:59.475
OR AT LEAST COMMITTED TO MAKING

04:55:59.541 --> 04:56:00.609
THAT AMENDMENT AT THE

04:56:00.676 --> 04:56:03.312
APPROPRIATE TIME- TO CONSTRAIN

04:56:03.378 --> 04:56:06.281
IT. STRICTLY TO. TO THOSE WHO

04:56:06.348 --> 04:56:08.917
ARE SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL- AND

04:56:08.984 --> 04:56:10.352
HAVE NO OTHER RESOURCES AT THEIR

04:56:10.419 --> 04:56:13.188
DISPOSAL. BUT WE WANTED TO LEAVE

04:56:13.255 --> 04:56:15.224
SOME DISCRETION IN DEFERENCE FOR

04:56:15.290 --> 04:56:17.793

04:56:17.860 --> 04:56:19.361
DIRECTORS TO MAKE THOSE KIND OF

04:56:19.428 --> 04:56:20.462
DETERMINATIONS ON THE STREETS.

04:56:20.529 --> 04:56:22.264
THAT THAT WAS THE HARD PART IS

04:56:22.331 --> 04:56:24.700
WE DIDN'T. WE DIDN'T WANT TO

04:56:24.766 --> 04:56:26.602
DEFINE IT JUST BASED ON IF

04:56:26.668 --> 04:56:28.537
SOMEONE SAY IS GRAVELY DISABLED

04:56:28.604 --> 04:56:29.905
BECAUSE YOU TRIGGER THAT A WHOLE

04:56:29.972 --> 04:56:31.974
OTHER RANGE OF QUESTIONS THAT IT

04:56:32.040 --> 04:56:33.275
WOULD ONLY BE ELIGIBLE FOR

04:56:33.342 --> 04:56:34.076
PEOPLE UP UNDER CONSERVATORSHIP

04:56:34.143 --> 04:56:34.776
STORE ELIGIBLE FOR

04:56:34.843 --> 04:56:36.044
CONSERVATIVES. WE DON'T WANT TO

04:56:36.111 --> 04:56:38.413
JUST STAY IN THAT SPACE BECAUSE
