IN ADDITION TO MY THREE SISTERS JANET IN REDDING SHANNON MOUNT SHASTA AND SERRA IN SAN DIEGO. DURING OUR CONVERSATION TODAY I HOPE TO DEMONSTRATE MY PASSION FOR THIS WORK. STRENGTHENING CALIFORNIA'S AGING AND DISABILITY NETWORK IS MUCH MORE THAN A JOB FOR ME. MY SISTERS AND I SHARED CARE GIVING RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR MOM. WHO LIVED INDEPENDENTLY WITH DEMENTIA AND RURAL LAKE COUNTY BEFORE SHE SUFFERED A DEBILITATING STROKE THAT NECESSITATED YEARS A MEDIC CAL FUNDED NURSING HOME CARE. I FIRST HAND CARE GIVING EXPERIENCE WHILE WORKING FULL TIME AND RAISING TEENAGE DAUGHTERS. INFLUENCES MY THINKING AS A STAFF LEADER. AS A DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR IN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. AND AS THE LEAD INTO T. FOR THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING. I'M INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL TO GOVERNOR NEWSOM FOR APPOINTING ME TO THIS ROLE AND I'M EAGER TO ALIGN MY PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE FIVE OLD GOALS AND CALIFORNIA'S MASTER PLAN FOR AGING. NUMBER ONE HOUSING FOR ALL AGES AND STAGES. TO HELP REIMAGINE. THREE INCLUSION AND EQUITY NOT ISOLATION FOR CARE GIVING THAT WORKS AND FIVE AFFORDING AGING. I'LL TALK ABOUT IT DURING OUR TIME TODAY BUT THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING IS CALIFORNIA'S NORTH NORTH STAR AND THE STATE'S TEN YEAR BLUEPRINT TO PREPARE FOR THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY ONE ONE AND FOR CALIFORNIANS WILL BE AGE SIXTY OR OLDER. MY THREE DECADES OF WORK IN SACRAMENTO AS THE NONPROFIT SECTOR LOBBYIST. CONSUMER ADVOCATE AND HEALTH POLICY EXPERT HAS PREPARED ME FOR TODAY'S CONFIRMATION HEARING. TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO I STARTED MY CAREER WITH LEADING H. CALIFORNIA AS THEIR STAFF LOBBYIST FOCUSED ON AFFORDABLE SENIOR HOUSING. ASSISTED LIVING AND NONPROFIT SKILLED NURSING PROVIDERS. FROM THEIR ISLAND UC DAVIS HEALTH SYSTEMS GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS PROGRAM FOR SEVEN YEARS. IN THIS ROLE I GAINED EXPERTISE ON MEDICARE MEDICAID AND VETERANS ADMINISTRATION FINANCING AS WELL AS MEDICAL AND NURSING EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS I SERVED AS GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR THE NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION WHERE I GAVE VOICE TO CALIFORNIANS DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY ALZHEIMER'S AND DEMENTIA. THE MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. IT WAS IN THIS ROLE THAT I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS AN APPOINTED MASTER PLAN FOR AGING STAKEHOLDER AS WELL AS A MEMBER OF THE GOVERNOR'S ALZHEIMER'S PREVENTION AND PREPAREDNESS TASK FORCE. IT IS SUCH A HIGH HONOR TO USE MY PERSONAL. AND PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND I WELCOME QUESTIONS. FROM ALL OF YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH YOUR OPENING COMMENTS AND I THINK I'M GONNA MEDEVACED HERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO START UPS STARTERS OFFICES YOUR WHEEL HOUSE I THINK COMPREHENSIVE A- PRESENTATION OF OUR DIRECTOR NORRIS AND ON THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT SECTOR OF OUR SOCIETY- OFTEN OVERLOOKED. I THINK I AM NOT AS VULNERABLE AS THEY TRULY ARE SO APPRECIATE THAT I AM ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE HOUSING ISSUE AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE MOST VULNERABLE DO INCLUDE OUR SENIORS. ARE WITH FROM THE PANDEMIC AND ALL THAT THAT BROUGHT FORWARD IS CERTAINLY THAT THE GREAT RECESSION SO. AND WONDERING HOW THE DEPARTMENT IS COLLABORATING CERTAINLY OUT OF STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES ARE ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ISSUE FOR OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES COULD YOU. GIVE US SOME IDEA OF THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE THERE IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO YOUR LEGISLATORS AS WE CONTINUE TO- CONFRONT THE HOUSING ISSUE IN OUR STATE YEAH AND THE LACK THERE OF. OF IT FOR CERTAINLY ALL OUR YOUNGER PEOPLE- WHO WILL BE GROWING INTO INDEPENDENCE AND DOWN OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND WHICH ARE. SENIORS ARE CERTAINLY CLASSIFIED. THANK YOU SEE BATES FOR THAT. AND YOU YOU LIKELY KNOW THAT- ADULTS FIFTY AND OLDER ARE THE FASTEST GROWING DEMOGRAPHIC IN OUR STATE AMONG THE HOMELESSNESS POPULATION- NOT A SURPRISE THAT THE NUMBER ONE GOAL IN THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING. IS HOUSING FOR ALL AGES AND STAGES. AND THE STRENGTH OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING IS THE COMPREHENSIVE VIEW THAT IT TAKES WORKING ACROSS AGENCIES- THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY HOUSING AGENCY. TO ADDRESS- B. THE NEEDS OF OLDER ADULTS I'M FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING HOUSING WITH SERVICES AND SUPPORT. AND TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN OUR STATE. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR SISTER DEPARTMENTS AND EIGHT AND AGENCIES- ON HOUSING ISSUES WE WORK MOST CLOSELY WITH OUR AREA AGENCIES ON AGING. AND ARE AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CONNECTIONS THAT ARE ON THE GROUND IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND THEY SERVE AS A KEY REFERRAL POINTS- TO LINK OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. HOUSING OPTIONS- IN MY ROLE AS DIRECTOR I'VE ALSO BEEN NAMED TO THE INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS AND I HAVE- ATTENDED ONE MEETING THUS FAR BUT I'M VERY IMPRESSED. BY THE DIVERSE CROSS SECTION OF EXPERTS AND ADVOCATES WHO SERVE IN THAT. ON THAT- COUNCIL ALONG WITH THE TWO TWO. CABINET SECRETARIES WHO LEAD BACK FROM. HOUSING AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. THANK YOU FOR THAT OUT I JUST STARTED FIVE JUST TO BE TO YOUR- IF I'M SURE YOU. COULD BE VERY AWARE OF IT. VERY VERY AWARE OF THAT THAT THE RENOWNED. A REQUIREMENTS REALLY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SOME COMMUNITIES TO. ADDRESS THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THE AFFORDABILITY AND IN PARTICULAR TO FOCUS ON PARTICULAR GROUPS. THERE ARE SO MANY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. COMMITTEES ON AGING AND SENIOR CENTERS I'M JUST SAYING THAT I THINK IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT THAT THEY GET DIALED AND IF. IF THE OUTRAGE CAN BE EXPANDED TO TALK. THROUGH THOSE OUR COMMUNITY AGENCIES ABOUT THE NEED SPECIFICALLY FOR HIM THOSE COMMUNITIES ON. THE APPROACH TO ALLOWING CERTAIN LEVEL HOUSING THAT WILL ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN VERY IMPRESSED WITH. HOW THE COMMUNITIES CERTAINLY IN MY DISTRICT ARE STARTING TO COME TOGETHER THE CITY. TO ADDRESS MORE AND REGIONAL MANNER WHAT WHAT THEIR DEMOGRAPHICS ARE IN AND IN PARTICULAR AS- WE LOOK AT THE AGE COMPONENT OF THAT. IN REALLY- KIND OF DOUBLE DOWN ON TRYING TO FIND. OR THEY CAN CREATE THE HOUSING THAT ADDRESS US ISSUE THAT ARE NOT JUSTICE TO LIVE WE HAVE. A NUMBER OF THOSE BUT FUN ARE WHO WANT TO REMAIN INDEPENDENT INDIVIDUAL. APARTMENTS LIVING ON THEIR OWN I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF CONTINUING TO BE POSITIVE. AS WE AGE- AND CONNECT WITH OUR COMMUNITY SO JUST TO KIND OF PUT THAT INTO THE HOPPER OFFER. A DISCUSSION AS YOU GO FORWARD ONE LAST QUESTION OBVIOUSLY ARE WITH THE PANDEMIC OF THE- PARTICULAR AGE GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY THE ISOLATION HAS BEEN. THE TWO ENDS OF THE SPECTRUM ARE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THOSE SENIORS- BECAUSE A LACK OF ABILITY TO SOCIALIZE WHICH IS SO VERY IMPORTANT TO GOOD. YOU KNOW MENTAL HEALTH. SO I KNOW YOU HAD THE F. FINDER REMEMBERING IT CORRECTLY A FRIENDSHIP. OF LINE FOR CRISIS AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT pGIVE A LITTLE- UPDATE ON HOW THAT'S WORKED ARE THERE ANY BEST PRACTICES COMING OUT OF THAT- THAT WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IN IN TERMS OF OUR REFERRALS. OF CONSTITUENTS. THANK YOU RAY- WE SHARE CAN ABOUT ISOLATE THAT IS A GOAL IN THE MASTER PLAN FOR ASIAN FOR THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING. INCLUSION AND EQUITY NOT ISOLATION AND THAT CAME OUT OF THE PANDEMIC SO YES THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING IS SO CROWDED THAT THE FRIENDSHIP LINE WAS. WAS OFFERED- FREE OF CHARGE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK TO ALL CALIFORNIANS TO HAVE A- A WARM CONVERSATION WITH A LIVE HUMAN AND TO DATE WE'VE RECEIVED OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND. CALLS THROUGH THE FRIENDSHIP LINE AND THAT CONTINUES TODAY- IN ADDITION WE HAVE MADE DIRECT CONTACT TO. ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE THREE POINT SIX MILLION HOUSEHOLDS. WHERE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SHARE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AVAILABLE TO THEM STATEWIDE REGIONALLY AND LOCALLY SO THAT THEY CAN. CONNECT OR- SENIOR NUTRITION- ALZHEIMER'S SUPPORTS- ABUSE AND NEGLECT SO WE HAVE PROVIDED- POSTCARDS TO HOUSEHOLDS- OF OLDER ADULTS AND WE PROVIDED THOSE IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH. AND WE'RE WE'RE REALLY EXCITED THAT- AS WE SPEAK- WE ARE OPENING UP AGAIN OUR ADULT DAY EALTHCARE CENTERS AROUND THE STATE. AND SENIOR CONGREGATE SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAMS ARE RETURNING TO IN PERSON- ACTIVITIES AND THAT'S ALL MADE POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE HIGH RATE OF VACCINATIONS. AMONG THE- THE SIXTY FIVE PLUS WE'RE AT AN EIGHTY THREE PERCENT. TAX AND THAT ALLOWS OLDER ADULTS AND SAFELY COME AGAIN IN THE CA WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT. TO COMBAT ISOLATION. THANK YOU THERE ARE SEVERAL REALLY GOOD NEWS FOR ALL OF US BUT ANYWAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR DEDICATION IN THIS SPACE IT'S BEEN FULL VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE- THE DEPARTMENT ON AGING AND FOCUSING ON THEIR- END OF THE CONTINUUM SO. YOU'VE BEEN OUT THE HEADWATERS OF THE R. ANDO CERTAINLY I APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT AND YOU WILL HAVE MY SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR OF THE CENTER COM MARKER. MADAM PRO TEM AND- THANK YOU FOR. GOING UP TODAY I IT WAS I THINK WE HAD A VERY NICE CONVERSATION ON MONDAY- OR TUESDAY AND SO IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU HERE- I REALLY JUST HAVE- TWO QUESTIONS- ONE IS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THERE WAS AN ARTICLE IN TODAY'S LA TIMES. REGARDING HOSPICE AND HOSPICE CARE AND WHILE I KNOW IT'S NOT UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING I THINK HOSPICE IS UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- AB IT IS STILL AN ISSUE THAT IMPACTS OUR AGING POPULATION AND SO THE ARTICLE IN THE ISSUES THAT SORT OF RESULTED FROM AN AUDIT. CONDUCTED BY THE STATE YOU KNOW SPEAK TO THE FRAMEWORK OUR SENIORS- AND CARES FOR THE AGING. AND THE VULNERABILITIES OF OUR SYSTEM YOU KNOW- SORT OF IRONICALLY DESIGNED YOU KNOW FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE SO JUST WANTED TO KNOW- AID TO CDA COLLABORATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THEN BE WHAT ROLE KID OF DO YOU SEE- THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING PLAYING IN HOW WE TACKLE THIS ISSUE AROUND PROVIDING- QUALITY HOSPICE CARE. THANK YOU SENATOR COME UNDER THREAT FOR MEETING WITH ME- AND ALSO FOR THAT QUESTION AND YES I'M NOT I'M AWARE OF THAT REPORT THAT WAS ISSUED JUST YESTERDAY. AND YOUARE CORRECT THAT- HOSPICE AGENCIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE OVERSEEN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. BUT IN OUR ROLE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND AS THE LEAD ENTITY FOR THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING WE LOOK AT THE FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE- THAT'S PROVIDED TO OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AT ALL STAGES OF THEIR LIFESPAN. AND HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE CARE ARE CERTAINLY CRITICAL PIECES OF THAT CONTINUUM OF CARE- IN TERMS OF OUR ROLE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING- WE ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO. PROVIDING INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE TO CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES LOCALLY SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE WELL INFORMED CHOICES ABOUT THEIR OPTIONS FOR CARE AT EVERY LEVEL INCLUDING HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE CARE- AND WE'RE VERY COMMITTED AND GRATEFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR FOR SUPPORT. TO SUPPORT A NO WRONG DOOR SYSTEM SO THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN BETTER NAVIGATE ALL OF THE OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM THROUGH A VARIETY OF FUNDING SOURCES INCLUDING MEDICARE. MEDICAID I'LL VETERANS BENEFITS AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE CARE SO OUR ROLE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING IS REALLY TO EQUIP PEOPLE WITH THE INFORMATION AND RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED. TO MAKE THE RIGH CHOICE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES WE DO COLLABORATE. CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. CARE SERVICES AS A MEDIC CAL. PROVIDER IN OUR STATE AND I AT THE MANSION THIS IS NEW INFORMATION THAT WILL BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM AND IN. THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME ON THIS TOPIC. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT. YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALKED- I THINK I TOLD YOU THAT I THOUGHT ONE OF THE MOST OVERLOOKED POPULATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE OUR SENIORS AND YET SO MANY OF US HAVE. STORIES THAT WE CAN SHARE ABOUT PEOPLE IN OUR LIVES WHO ARE- OUR ELDERS. THAT WE LOVE- AND THAT WE YOU KNOW WE LOVE THEM THROUGH EACH STAGE OF THEIR LIFE. IN THIS CHALLENGES THAT WERE FACED AS THEY GOT OLDER IN NEEDED CARE AND SO WE TALKED ABOUT- TWO THINGS. NURSING CARE FACILITIES AND THEN KICK CARE GIVERS HOW WE SUPPORT AND HOW WE SEE OUR CARE GIVERS. AND I KNOW THAT CTA'S RECENTLY CREATED THE OFFICE OF LONG TERM CARE PATIENT REPRESENTATIVE- WHICH I THINK IS SUPPOSED TO HELP FOCUS WITH OUR NURSING CARE ISSUES- AND I KNOW THAT YOU- CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE- PAID FAMILY CARE GIVER. SO JUST WANTED TO GET SORT OF YOUR THOUGHTS BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT ON AVERAGE. THE CARE GIVERS IN THE SPACE ARE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY THEIR FORTY SEVEN FORTY EIGHT YEARS OLD THEY TEND TO BE WOMEN THEY TEND TO BE WOMEN OF COLOR. SO CAN YOU TALK TO- WHAT CALIFORNIA PLANS TO DO TO HELP THIS POPULATION YOU KNOW OUR UNPAID FAMILY CAREGIVERS AS WELL AS SUPPORTING. OUR CARE GIVER STRUCTURE ARE PAID FAMILY CARE GIVER STRUCTURE YOU KNOW THESE FOLKS ARE WORKING REALLY HARD. BURN OUT. UNDER RESOURCE. DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY NECESSARILY HAVE SUPPORTS ARE OFTEN STRUGGLING THROUGH- THIS- WORK ALONE- WITHOUT ALWAYS ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS THAT ARE IMPACTING THEIR LOVED ONES OFTEN TIMES THEIR PARENTS OR THEIR GRANDPARENTS- AND THEN ALSO SORT OF WHAT WE'RE DOING. AND THE NURSING CARE SPACE TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ARE FACILITIES THAT- YOU KNOW HAVE THE CAPACITY- HAVE A STRUCTURE IN PLACE THAT ALLOWS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY. AND SAFETY AND THE CARE- I THINK OF OUR MOST PRECIOUS POPULATION- WOULD LOVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. THANK YOU SO THAT IT THAT IS A TWO PART QUESTION I'LL TAKE THE- WORKS THE CARE GIVER AND WORKFORCE QUESTION FIRST- SO WE DO HAVE FOUR MILLION FAMILY CAREGIVERS AND OUR STATE. AND THOSE ARE UNPAID ROLES AND THEY ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR STATE'S LONG TERM CARE SYSTEM PROVIDING FAR AND AWAY MORE CARE IN HOMES- THAT ARE PAID WORKFORCE AND YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT ABOUT THE DEMOGRAPHIC. EARLY WOMEN WOMEN OF COLOR- WHO ARE CARING FOR LOVED ONES IN THEIR HOME- SO THE WAY THAT THE STATE HAS APPROACH THAT AND WE'RE INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR- THE ANCHOR- FOR OUR STATES- CARE GIVERS. SYSTEM WOULD BE THE ELEVEN CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTERS WE HAVE A NETWORK THAT IS STATEWIDE AND AVAILABLE- IN EVERY COMMUNITY FREE OF CHARGE TO SUPPORT THE CARE GIVER- IN ADDITION- THERE WAS SPENDING IN THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SPENDING PLAN THAT WENT- TO FAMILY CAREGIVERS. AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL FUNDING THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S ALZHEIMER'S PREVENTION AND PREPAREDNESS PLAN I WENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND TO SUPPORT FAMILY CAREGIVERS WITH. TRAINING IN ADDITION- CAL AIMAR MEDIKAL INITIATIVE- NOW INCLUDES RESPITE SUPPORTS AS A MEDIC CAL BENEFIT AND THAT WILL BE HUGE FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. WHO HAVE A LOVED ONE WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE NOW. AND THEN LAST BUT NOT LEAST- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT. PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FOR CAREGIVER SUPPORTS AND TRAINING AND ALL OF THOSE DOLLARS FLOW THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING. AND GO DIRECTLY TO OUR AREA AGENCIES ON AGING AND THEY BASED THIS FIRST THOSE DOLLARS LOCALLY- THROUGH. THROUGH. COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS. IN TERMS OF THE PAID WORKFORCE- AGAIN THE OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES RELY ON THE FULL CONTINUUM OF. WORKERS AND- WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR I'M FOR APPROVING NEARLY A BILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR IN DIRECT CARE WORKFORCE FINDING THAT TODAY IS BEING SPENT ON IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- AT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING WE ARE WORKING WITH HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS LIKE ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE. PROGRAM FOR ALL INCLUSIVE CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND THE MULTIPURPOSE SENIOR SERVICES PROGRAM WHERE WE'RE PROVIDING TRAINING AND STIPENDS FOR THE DIRECT CARE WORKFORCE. AND IN ADDITION CERTIFIED NURSE AIDES WHO PROVIDE THE BULK OF WORK IN NURSING HOMES- THERE'S FUNDING THAT SUPPORTS- CAREER PATHWAYS PIPELINES AND INCENTIVES FOR CERTIFIED PAINS AND THAT IS BEING- OVERSEEN BY. H. CHI. SO THOSE WOULD BE THAT THE INFORMAL AND FORMAL CARE GIVER AND ISSUED ITS AND THEN WE'RE VERY EXCITED THAT THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET INCLUDES ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN FURTHER WORKFORCE INVESTMENT. IS WOULD GO TOWARDS SOCIAL WORKERS NURSES AND COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS. THE SECOND PIECE OF YOUR QUESTION RELATED TO NURSING FACILITIES AND IN OUR STATE WE HAVE TWELVE HUNDRED LICENSED NURSING HOMES. THEY ARE- OVERSEEN BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND MANY OF THEM RECEIVE MEDICAID FUNDING- SO THERE'S A LINK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. OUR ROLE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING IS LIMITED TO THE STATE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN BONTA CASTRO WHO WAS APPOINTED. INTO HER ROLE ON THIS ANYWHERE IS DOING AT. JOB WORKING WITH A- THE THIRTY FIVE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHERE WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE. THIRTY EIGHT CERT VOLUNTEERS AND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY STAFF MEMBERS. WHO REPRESENT THE NEEDS AND INTERESTS AND PREFERENCES AND RIGHTS OF NURSING HOM RESIDENTS THAT THEIR CLIENT IS THE NURSING HOME RESIDENTS. AND OUR OMBUDSMAN THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAVE BEEN DOING A FANTASTIC JOB RE ENTERING NURSING FACILITIES TO SUPPORT- THE RESIDENTS THERE. AND AS YOU MENTIONED WE DID JUST ESTABLISHED THE OFFICE OF THE PATIENT REPRESENTATIVE. BEIJING AND SUSAN RODRIGUEZ HAS BEEN A- NAME TO THAT TO LEAVE THAT OFFICE AND THEY ARE THE FOCUS IS ON INDIVIDUALS WHO RESIDE IN NURSING HOMES WHO HAVE NO FAMILY. NO FRIENDS THEIR UNSUPPORTED AND REPRESENTED AND THE ASSIST- THOSE RESIDENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR HEALTHCARE WISHES AND THEIR RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED. THANK YOU FOR THAT. INFORMATIVE RESPONSE AND- THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR THE TIME THAT YOU GAVE ME EARLIER THIS WEEK AND LOOK FORWARD TO- SUPPORTING YOUR CONFIRMATION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. HE CENTER. THANK YOU US SENATOR LAYERED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR INTO A- TO THE DIRECTOR THANK YOU FOR THE MEETING EARLIER IN THE WEEK- I'M- THURMOND GREAT QUESTIONS AND IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW. UP TO MEMBERS THAT HAVE HAVE RULING. FOR SOME OF THE ISSUES SO LET ME GO TO THE TOP LEVEL OF WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT WHICH IS. A TEN YEAR MASTER PLAN WAS ADOPTED FOR SERVICES WERE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS SHOOTING FOR TWENTY THIRTY- AND IT'S A BLUEPRINT. M. THE ONE THING THE LEGISLATURE DID LAST YEAR IS WE GAVE YOU MANY POSITIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE- THE PLAN. WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT TO SEE THAT'S PRACTICAL THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE PLAN IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WHERE DO YOU THINK. THERE ARE GAPS OR- FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES THAT ARE PART OF THAT PLAN THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO REALLY FOCUS ON AND YOU MAY WELL BE COMING BACK TO US FOR. FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED AND THANK YOU ALSO FOR TAKING THE TIME TO MEET WITH ME IN PERSON- TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I WOULD SAY IT IT IT IS TWO FOLD- WHEN. WE CELEBRATED THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING IN JANUARY THE GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE AND SECRETARY MARK GALLEYS MESSAGE WAS. WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED SO TO YOUR POINT- I'D SAY IN THE MOST FRONT AND CENTER ISSUE TODAY IS THE WORK FORCE CRISIS. AND WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING.ACROSS THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. AS WELL AS WITH THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY HONEST WHEAT AS- INVESTMENTS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER DIRECT WORK. IN SUPPORT SERVICES FRONTLINE WORKERS- CERTIFIED NURSE AIDES- LICENSE BILL. NURSES. OUR WAY AND WE'LL SUPPORT IN AND THEIR- IN COMMUNITIES AND THEN MY SETTINGS AS THE SYSTEM LIVING AND NURSING HOMES AND WE ALSO OLDER ADULTS AND- ARE HIGHER UTILIZE THERE'S A HOSPITAL SERVICES THAT WE NEED THE WORK FORCE AND ALL OF THOSE SETTINGS. ESPECIALLY ALL SERVICES- SO THAT'S THAT IS AND CENTER RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR WILL CONTINUE THOSE INVESTMENTS- IN THIS YEAR'S IN THE PROPOSED. AND WE'LL SEE. MORE WORK WITH COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS SOCIAL WORKERS AND NURSES IN THE ENSUING IN SEVEN YEARS. OUR OUR DEPARTMENT US SPECIFICALLY I WOULD SAY- OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS WILL BE LASER FOCUSED ON THE NO WRONG DOOR SYSTEM THAT I MENTIONED. AND THAT'S WHERE- IT'S PART OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING AND IT'S REALLY PERSON CENTERED- CONSUMER FOCUSED. TO HELP INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHEREVER THEY ARE WHEREVER THEY LIVE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS INFORMATION. I FOUND. THEY GET FIVE. IN MY- ACCESS IN INTERACTIVE- AND- OF COURSE ACCESS INFORMATION. LOCALLY IN PERSON THEIR AREA AGENCY ON AGING OR THEIR AGING AND JUST RESOURCE CAN. EIGHTY C. RIGHT NOW I'M ARE ARE X. HAS- WE'RE VERY PROUD WE NOW THIRTY COUNTIES IN OUR STATE. THAT MEANS TWENTY EIGHT ARE NOT YET COVERED SO THAT WILL BE OUR FOCUS IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS WE TRY TO TAKE THAT STATEWIDE. LET ME FOLLOW UP BECAUSE IT IT SEEMS THAT AND YOU SAID IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT THAT THERE WERE. I'M I'M NOT RECALLING THE NUMBER EXACTLY THREE OR FOUR MILLION REFERRALS OR- OR A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION THAT FORMAT. BUT THENAS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION THAT SERVICES THAT AREN'T FULLY DEVELOPED FOR. ARE ADEQUATE RIGHT NOW SO IF. D. A. THE EIGHT YOU JUST COMMENTED THAT IT IS REALLY WORKFORCE EXPANDING THE WORK FORCE AND CARE BECAUSE THE BOOM. IN ELDERS IS COMING AND SO IS IT REALLY. ALL THE EXISTING KINDS OF SERVICES ARE THERE IT'S THE VOLUME THAT ISN'T THERE AND ITS WORK FORCE THAT IS THE REAL ISSUE ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S AN ADEQUATE VOLUME OF CARE SERVICES AVAILABLE. AN INTERNET I BELIEVE IT IT IS BOTH- IN IN TERMS OF- INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDING OUT OUR STATE'S INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY TO PREPARE FOR TWENTY THIRTY WHEN WE KNOW THE VOLUME WILL BE. AT A LEVEL WE'VE NEVER EVER SEEN IN OUR STATE BEFORE. WE NEED TO INVEST IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT IS AN AREA THAT WILL BE TALKING TO THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT IS HOW WE BUILD- A CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM- A STANDARDIZED INTAKE AND ASSESSMENT PROCESS THAT- WHAT WHICHEVER COUNTY AREA AND- WE CAPTURE IMPORTANT DATA INCLUDING SO G. DATA- DATE ON AIDS- ETHNICITY AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN BE A TRULY DATA DRIVEN- SYSTEM IN OUR STATE. ALSO TO BUILD THAT- WE DO OFFER AN EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER STATEWIDE TODAY BUT TO BE ABLE. AND TO REFER PEOPLE TO THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES AND TO HAVE AVAILABLE IN THE LANGUAGE OF AS CHOICE WILL TAKE SOME CAPACITY BUILDING AND THEN TO YOUR HERE POINT- ABOUT THE WORK FORCE. IF YOU HAVE A CENTRALIZED NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND A REFERRAL PROCESS THAT THAT THE NETWORK IS INADEQUATE AND WE DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT- PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO MEET PEOPLE'S NEEDS OR WE DON'T HAVE THE WORKFORCE AVAILABLE STAFF THOSE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES- WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY BUILDING. AND WORKFORCE OVERLAYS BOTH OF THOSE. WE'RE USING TOGETHER MY CONCERN BUT I'M STILL NERVOUS BECAUSE IT IT SEEMS THAT. BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE REALLY GOOD IN THE REFERRAL SYSTEM AND REALLY GOOD AT THE INFORMATIONAL SYSTEM AND WE'RE REALLY ON SURE THAT THEY'LL BE AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF SERVICES THERE- TO REFORM TO. AN OBVIOUSLY THE WORK FORCE IS A MAJOR ISSUE DO YOU THINK IF WE WERE TO DEVELOP SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL WORK FORCE. THAT WILL GET US THERE OR DO YOU THINK THAT THERE ARE SUCH A LEVEL OF FACILITY SERVICES AND OTHER THINGS THAT THE WORK FORCE IS THE FIRST STEP. AND OTHER STEPS BECAUSE- THIS IS HAPPENING. A. N. ARE WE HAVE FIND OUT WERE IN IT. AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MARCHING DOWN THE PATH A DIFFERENT WAY ON THE WAY TO BEING IN SO HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT'S NOT JUST WORK FORCE BUT HAVING THE BROADER AVAILABILITY OF THESE KINDS OF SERVICE. WHAT THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING WAS A CRITICAL FIRST STEP TO OUTLINE- OUR NETWORK OUR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND TO IDENTIFY GAPS AND MOST CERTAINLY THROUGH THE KOBE PANDEMIC WE HAVE. DISCOVERED WHERE IN OUR STATE WERE LACKING SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR INDIVIDUAL WHETHER THEIR ACUTE CARE. LONG TERM CARE OR HOME CARE- SO WE HAVE LEARNED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS ABOUT INADEQUACIES IN OUR SYSTEM. IT'S NOT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING BUT- THE LEGISLATURE- DID SUPPORT- AT HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES- ROAD MAP THAT WILL BE- EMBARKED UPON BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT WE ARE IN A- IN A ACTIVELY MOVING TOWARDS- S. WHERE WE WILL MAP ALL OF THE SYSTEMS AND SERVICES. ACROSS OUR STATE NOT ONLY MEDICAL SERVICES BUT MANY SERVICES SUCH AS THE ONES PROVIDED BY. THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING THAT DON'T HAVE. AN INCOME THRESHOLD THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE IN THE COMMUNITY BASED ON NEED SO WE ARE- IN THE PROCESS NOW OF MAPPING ALL OF THESE SERVICES SO THAT WE CAN. TELL COUNTY BY COUNTY WHAT IS AVAILABLE AND WHAT IS NOT AVAILABLE AND THEN TO BUILD OUT. A STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF. SERVICES PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND- I WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE YOU AND YOU INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SLOTS IN OUR MSSP WHICH IS THE MULTI PURPOSE SENIOR SERVICES PROGRAM- YOU HAVE CONTINUED TO SUPPORT- SEE BASS THE COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES. PROGRAM THAT'S ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE- SO WE'VE SEEN INVESTMENTS TO INCREASE CAPACITY D. AND WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO. YOU KNOW CONTINUE WITH THOSE INVESTMENTS. I THINK THAT THAT'S MY POINT IS. IS THERE A ROAD MAP TO THE CONTINUE INVESTMENTS THAT'S COMING FROM THIS PLAN. FOR IT ARE WE JUST IDENTIFYING WHERE THERE'S GAPS IN STORE- LEGALLY MOVING TOWARD IT I MEAN HOW ARE WE REALLY. GOING TO ADDRESS WHAT THE GAPS ARE IN THE SYSTEM. WE'RE IN THE BEGINNING STAGES OF- BUILDING THAT ROAD MAP THAT WILL IDENTIFY THE GAPS AND THE NEXT STEP AFTER THAT WOULD BE TO SELL THOSE CLOSE THOSE GAPS- ONCE WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE AND THE LEVEL OF CARE WHAT IS NEEDED- SO WE HAVE. A GOOD DEAL OF ANECDOTAL INFORMATION AND WE CAN CERTAINLY TELL YOU. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING WHICH COUNTIES HAVE ADULT DAY HEALTHCARE CENTERS AND WHICH DO NOT- BUT EVEN IF- WITH A MAP LIKE THAT- IN A LARGE COUNTY YOU KNOW SOME OF THE COUNTIES THAT YOU HAVE. TO SAY THAT WE HAVE ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE IN YOUR COUNTY- IT MIGHT BE A THREE HOUR DRIVE FOR SOMEBODY TO GET ACROSS THE COUNTY ACCESS THAT SO. WE'RE YOU KNOW WE THINK THE FIRST STEP IS NAVIGATION THEN ACCESS. WHETHER IT'S WORK AND THEN WORK FORCE AND THEY ALL GO HAND IN HAND. TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM TO ACCESS THE SERVICES. THAT ARE NEEDED AND- LOOKING AT THE POPULATION YOU KNOW THE DEMOGRAPHIC INDIVIDUALS FOR INSTANCE SIXTY TO A HUNDRED ARE NOT A HOMOGENEOUS GROUP AND THEY ALL DON'T NEED THE SAME THING AT THE SAME TIME SO THERE'S SOME COMPLEXITY TO THIS THAT WILL BE TALKING TO YOU- IN THE LEGISLATURE AND YOUR STAFF AND CERTAINLY WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT HOW WE RIGHT SIZED. OUR NETWORK- FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WELL I CAN'T HELP BUT COMMENT BECAUSE YOU SAID SIXTY TO A HUNDRED PER NIGHT OR BOTH IN THAT GROUP AND WE ARE NOT MUCH OF THIS. IS SO- BUT THE POINT IS I THINK I'M NOT GOING TO BEAT THE DEAD HORSE ANY FURTHER BUT I SPENT ALL THIS TIME. JERRY MEETINGS HOW DO GET TO THE END. JUST HOW DO WE GET TO THE END WE COULD HAVE PROCESS. FOR A LONG TIME BUT THEY'LL BE PEOPLE THAT NEED NURSING HOME SERVICES AND IT WON'T BE THERE SO. SO JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO IDENTIFY. THIS HOW WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO MEET THE NEED HAS SOMEBODY'S GONNA COME TO US AND SAY HERE'S WITH THE GAP IS. THAN THAT AND MY FINAL QUESTION IS RELATED TO THAT AND- THEN I SORT OF INTIMATED TO IT WOULDN'T ASK ANYTHING UNLESS WE- TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE MEETING BUT THIS IS DEVELOPED IN A DIFFERENT WAY STAND. MEMBERS MOVE. TO THE- A VET. IN THE MONTEREY PENINSULA. AND IN DRILLING DOWN TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THIS I'VE HAD ALL THESE MEETINGS WITH CALVET AND OF ALL THESE MEETINGS WITH VETERANS SERVICE OFFICERS AND THEY DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER IN A CLEAR HUESO I FACILITATED. ARE AN HOUR LONG MEETING TO GET TO TALK TO EACH OTHER AND- AND WHAT WAS DETERMINED. IS THERE'S ADEQUATE SERVICES AND MEDICAL DIFFERENT THINGS THERE'S NOT ADEQUATE SKILLED NURSING AND THERE'S NOT ADEQUATE MEMORY CARE FOR VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S A WAITING LIST PEOPLE BEING TURNED AWAY. THEY'RE NOT ENOUGH SLOTS. THE SO. N. AND THEN. AND A VERY UNHELPFUL WAY ONE OF THE ADMINISTRATION PEOPLE SAID AT THE END OF THE MEETING ALL THIS IS THE LEGISLATURE'S RESPONSIBILITY AND THEN THERE WAS NO ROAD MAP OFFERED. FOR HOW WE MIGHT MEET THAT NEED WITHIN VETERANS AND SO. DO YOU WORK WITH THE VETERANS DEPARTMENT ON THEIR LONG TERM MORE MEMORY CARE ISSUES AND ARE THEY PART OF YOUR CONTINUUM OF SERVICES AND IF THEY'RE NOT MEETING THEIR NEEDS DO YOU HAVE THAT INCORPORATED IN YOUR PLAN AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WHAT. I WANT TO. THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING THE TOPIC OF VETERANS AND ABS ABSOLUTELY THAT'S PART OF WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO AND IN A ROAD MAP THAT IS NOT LIMITED ONLY TO. MEDIC CAL GAPS WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT IT'S INCLUSIVE OF OTHER GAPS INCLUDING WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED- IN THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION AND THE VETERANS DEPARTMENT AND- THE- DEPARTMENT WAS VERY ACTIVE IN THE MASTER PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS. AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING RELATED TO VETERANS AND THAT- WE WORK WE DO WORK- IN COLLABORATION. AND YOU'VE HIT ON- SORT OF THE SILOS THAT CONFRONT OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. YEAH THERE THERE'S FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGH MEDICARE AND THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION AND SOCIAL SECURITY AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STATE FUNDED PROGRAMS IN THEIR LOCAL PROGRAMS AND IT. IS IT CAN BE VERY CONFUSING ON THE GROUNDS FOR CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES- SO I WILL TAKE THAT BACK. AND BE SURE TO FOLLOW UP. ON THAT. TO SEE WHERE THINGS ARE THE VETERANS HOSPITAL COMING TO YOUR DISTRICT. YES IT'S I'M NOT NECESSARILY ADVOCATING FOR THE HOSPITAL BUT I AM ADVOCATING FOR THEIR BEING ADEQUATE CARE. FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THOSE CATEGORIES THAT ARE VETERANS HOWEVER IT IS AND I KNOW I'VE TALKED TO ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES WHO THINKS THAT. SB TWO LONG BILLS. OUT TO PROJECT RIGHT NOW AND THAT WOULD BE THE THING THAT THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING AND SO. IT'S THE COVERT BUT IT GETS BACK TO MY CENTRAL CONCERN I'LL JUST CLOSE WITH THE JUST RESTATED I REALLY WANT TO KNOW HOW TO GET TO THE END OF. I WAS THE WAIT TEN YEARS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF A HOSPITAL. IN THE ROLE VETERANS RIGHT NOW WITH WITH THE VOUCHER COULD FIND MEMORY CARE. WHICH THEY NEED URGENT. THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT WE WOULD WANT TO DO AND I AM WORKING FOR. JUST ASSISTANCE RATHER THAN. RACIST HE DOESN'T MATTER THE LEGISLATORS THE ONE COULD FEEL WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR SYSTEM TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE WE LOOKING AT ABOUT THEY- FEEL IN A CLEAR WAY THAT HOPING. IS OUT OF THE. PROCESS A IS NOT MORE PER. BUT BUT SOME. THAT COULD ACTUALLY. THANK YOU FOR BEARING WITH MIKE. I PUSH THANK YOU MATT CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR. IS- URGENCY IS BECAUSE HE HAD A BIRTHDAY YESTERDAY I THINK OUR- OF THE- WITH GREAT WITH GREAT SERIOUSNESS AND RESPECT- IT MISTER MORRIS I'M REALLY GLAD YOU'RE HERE AND- HAPPY TO LISTEN TO THIS CONVERSATION I MADE IT A NUMBER OF NOTES AND THE GOOD THING IS MY COLLEAGUES ASK. ALL THE QUESTIONS ARE TO WHICH I CAN JUST COMMENT ON- I DO THINK LISTEN TO YOUR OPENING COMMENTS AND- YOUR PERSONAL EXPERT. COMBINE WITH. A PHONE YES BURKE THROUGHOUT THIS HEARING THUS FAR. CONVINCES ME THAT YOU WERE YOU WERE DEEP IN EVERY ASPECT OF WHAT'S GOING ON AND UNDERSTAND HOW TO CONNECT THE DOTS AND ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES ASK A QUESTION ABOUT. YOUR PARTICULAR ROLE BUT HAVEN'T ALL THESE OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT TOUCH UPON VARIOUS ISSUES HOW DO YOU HAVE THE INFLUENCE HOW YOU HAVE THE POWER. AND THE ABILITY TO PULL THESE THINGS TOGETHER AND WHETHER YOU FEEL THAT'S GOING WELL THAT WAS THAT'S A KEY QUESTION I WAS THRILLED TO HEAR YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR PARTICIPATION EVEN IF YOU'VE BEEN TO ONE MEETING. IN THE INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS. THIS LEGISLATURE WORKED VERY HARD TO GET THAT INTER AGENCY COUNCIL TOOK US MULTIPLE TRIES TO GET THAT IN PLACE- I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS ON THE WORK FORCE IT'S ONE OF MY BIGGEST WORRIES. BECAUSE EVEN AS WE TALK ABOUT ALLOCATING OR PROPOSAL OF MORE THAN ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. FOR WORKFORCE ISSUES WE KNOW YOU MENTIONED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- MEDICAL STAFF GENERALLY- ALL LEVELS OF NURSING STAFF- MY BIGGEST CONCERN TO CENTER LAYER TO POINT IS HOW WE GET FROM POINT HEY. AND HOW DO THOSE VERY PRECIOUS DOT. WE HAVE TODAY THAT NOT ALWAYS HAD HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GET SPENT. TO GET US TO THE END AND GET THOSE WORKERS- WHO ARE ABLE TO FILL IN THE- THE POSITIONS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES SO. I WILL SAY ALL ALL OF LINK THE WORK FORCE ISSUES IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET TOO. AND I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A CONVERSATION BECAUSE- I CAN ALREADY SENSE OF PEOPLE- ARE GOING TO BE SUPPORTIVE. I CAN'T YOU KNOW. OF THIS APPOINTMENT- WE STILL HAVE THE PUBLIC TO WEIGH IN. BUT I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. YOU KNOW IT WAS GREAT TO HAVE OUR GOVERNOR NEWSOM IN HIS FIRST STATE OF THE STATE SPEECH. UNVEILED HIS SUPPORT AND PLAN. FOR THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING. WE HAD A FORMER SENATOR WHO ALREADY HAD BEEN WORKING ON THAT IN THE SENATE. AND HAD A BILL ARE SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON. AND WE HAD A HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE THAT I APPOINTED SPECIFICALLY WITH THE TASK. OF MEMBERS WHO WHO OVERSAW HEALTH AND HOUSING AND YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH WITH HER. AS WE PUT THAT PLAN FORWARD SO IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT HAVE A PLAN. AND A ROAD MAP. AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT HAVE A FRAMEWORK OF HOW THE INTEGRATION OCCURS IN A STATE AS LARGE AS CALIFORNIA. AND A GAP ANALYSIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. BUT I LINK ALL OF THESE THINGS TOGETHER BECAUSE I REALLY BELIEVE IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US WE GET TO BE THE ONES TO CONFIRM APPOINTEES. WE ALSO GET TO BE THE ONES TO OUR BUDGET PROCESS TO HAVE A TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND COME BACK TO YOU. NEXT IN THIS YEAR AND NEXT YEAR AS AS WE GET TO THE QUESTION THAT THAT CENTER LAYERED WAS ASKING WHAT WHAT WILL YOU ONGOING WE NEED FOR US TO GET THERE AND GET TO THE END. AND I WANT THAT TO BE THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE I FULLY EXPECT THAT WE WILL BE HAVING ANOTHER CONVERSATION WITH YOU PROBABLY IN A BUDGET. PERSPECTIVE OF WHERE ARE WE BECAUSE I THINK. ON ON EVERY ISSUE I FEEL LIKE ONCE CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE RESOURCES WE HAVE NOT HAD THE RESOURCES AS WERE ALL WHERE IN PREVIOUS YEARS. TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THESE THINGS AND WHEN WE DO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THOSE DOLLARS ARE SPENT THE WAY THEY NEED TO BE SPENT TO GET US WHAT WE WANT. FOR OUR CITIZENS. ARM FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS AND- YOU KNOW I HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE NO WRONG DOOR IT'S PART OF THE CHILDREN'S INITIATIVE NOW IT'S PARK. IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S OBVIOUSLY ONE OF OUR NEW. TERMS YOU KNOW- TERMS OF ART IN PROFESSIONAL TERMS IN THE TERMS OF WHERE WE NEED TO GO. I JUST MUCH LIKE YOU SENATOR LAYERED AND ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MEANS SOMETHING AND THAT IT IS CONNECTED SO. I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSES BECAUSE I REALLY REALLY THINK- IT SHOWS THAT YOU ARE WORKING TOWARDS MAKING THIS PLAN- AND IMPLEMENTING IT ARE MANY OF US THROUGH THE PANDEMIC SAW ALL OF THE COMMENTS YOU MENTIONED ABOUT THE LACK OF SERVICES OR THIS ORGANIZATION OR THE INTEGRATION. WE GOT TO SEE FRONT AND CENTRE WHAT THE IMPACT WAS ON SENIORS WHETHER THEY BE EN- SOME TYPE OF CARE FACILITY NURSING HOME OR IN HOME TRYING TO STAY CONNECTED TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD. DESPITE THE RISK AND A NUMBER OF US HAD SITUATIONS WHERE FAMILY MEMBERS NEEDED TO COUNT ON IN HOME HEALTH SERVICES. OF FOR VARIOUS REASONS AND SO. I JUST APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFULNESS AND YOUR EXPERTISE SO- BUT BUT IT ALL TO SAY WE WILL BE TALKING WITH YOU AGAIN IN ANOTHER VENUE TO ASK. ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT MY COLLEAGUES ASKED. WHAT MORE CAN WE DO AND HOW WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR HOW WE DO IT TO MAKE SURE THOSE SERVICES ARE ON THE GROUND- SO I JUST APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR COMMENTS. TODAY AND YOU'RE ANSWERING OUR QUESTIONS WITH THE DEATH AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE TO DO THAT. SO- I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND GO TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC BECAUSE- THEY EXPENDED ALL THE QUESTIONS AND I GOT TO DO MY- COMMENT TO EVERY SINGLE. QUESTION THEY ASK IMPORTANT BECAUSE I HAVE A BIRTHDAY COMING UP- YEAH. AND YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT OUR SENIORS BUT I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF US SITTING HERE THAT MEET THAT DEFINITION MAYBE NOT YOU SENATOR CALM WATER. BUT BUT A FEW OF US A FEW OF US. AND SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THEM BEFORE TALKING ABOUT US. YOU KNOW MADAM CHAIR HAD A HILARIOUS EXPERIENCE WHERE.

WITH ME TODAY IN SPIRIT IS MY TWO YEAR OLD DAUGHTER LUCY AND MY PARTNER J. SENT. BOTH OF WHOM I LOVE DEEPLY AND WHO KEEP ME MOTIVATED TO WORK EVERY DAY TO MAKE THIS WORLD BETTER FOR OUR NEXT GENERATION. IT'S AN HONOR TO BE ASKED TO SERVE CALIFORNIA IN THIS CAPACITY AND TO DO SO AT SUCH A FORMATIVE TIME. IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S CANNABIS INDUSTRY. LESS THAN A YEAR AFTER VOTERS PASSED PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR MAYOR ED LEE ASKED ME TO SERVE AS SAN FRANCISCO'S INAUGURAL DIRECTOR OF THE LOCAL OFFICES CANNABIS. IN THIS ROLE I LED THE DEVELOPMENT OF SAN FRANCISCO'S LOCAL REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THE TRANSITION LEGACY OPERATORS TO THE LEGAL MARKET AS WELL AS ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S EARLY EQUITY PROGRAMS. IN TWENTY NINETEEN I WAS ASKED TO SERVE AS THE GOVERNOR'S SENIOR ADVISER ON CANNABIS WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVING AND REFINING CALIFORNIA'S ADMINISTRATION OF THE MEDICAL AND ADULT USE CANNABIS REGULATION AND SAFETY ACT. THAT SAME YEAR I LED THE ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS TO ASSESS THE CANNABIS FRAMEWORK AND LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR A LARGE SCALE IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE THREE LEGACY PROGRAMS. THE CENTRALIZED OUR EFFORTS AND CREATE ONE UNIFIED POINT OF CONTACT FOR ALL LICENSEES IN STAKEHOLDERS. TAKEN TOGETHER THESE EXPERIENCES UNIQUELY QUALIFY ME TO SERVE AS THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROLS DIRECTOR. AS AN ORGANIZATION OUR VISION IS TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA HAS A STATE THE STATE OF ALL AN EQUITABLE CANNABIS MARKET THAT SERVES AS AN EXAMPLE FOR THE WORLD. I HAVE WASTED NO TIME IN WORKING TOWARDS THIS GOAL ALONGSIDE THE INCREDIBLE STAFF OF THIS DEPARTMENT. INCLUDING DEVELOPING MECHANISMS TO MEASURE OUR PROGRESS AND SUCCESS. I KNOW THAT THERE IS STILL MUCH TO BE DONE TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S TRANSITION TO THAT WELL REGULATED SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE LEGAL MARKET WE ALL WANT TO SEE. AS DIRECTOR IS CONFIRMED I COMMIT TO LEADING THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO MEET THIS OBJECTIVE THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A SMART AND COMPREHENSIVE. REGULATORY SYSTEM BY PURSUING SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS THE UNIQUE BARRIERS CANNABIS OPERATORS FACE AN IMPROVING COORDINATION WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS. LASTLY I AM COMMITTED TO MEETING THIS WORK WITH INCLUSIVITY SO THAT THE LUCIANS WE DEVELOP ARE NOT JUST EFFECTIVE AND EQUITABLE AND TRANSPARENT AS WELL. I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR TAKING OUT MY APPOINTMENT TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CENTER LAYERED YOU WANNA KICK US OFF. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. IN THANK YOU MADAM DIRECTOR FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE AND FOR MEETING WITH ME- TO HAVE A THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION ABOUT THE SUBJECT AND I THINK- I'D LIKE TO. TO ASK A COUPLE OF GLOBAL QUESTIONS AND ONE IS THAT. THERE IS BEEN THE GRADUAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BALLOT MEASURE AND THERE HAS BEEN THE COMBINATION. OF FIVE AGENCIES TO BECOME THE DEPARTMENT- JUST- WHAT ARE THE PRESSING ISSUES IN IN SORT OF FOR MAKING THIS. OUR. JUST INDUSTRY WE GOAL ARE LICENSED AND AVAILABLE ONE WAY THAT THAT IN COMPETING WITH THE UNDERGROUND INDUSTRY IT WORKS BETTER TO COME ABOVE GROUND AND BE REGULATED. SO I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PRESSING ISSUES- THE INDUSTRY ITSELF IS IN A TRANSITION AYE WE'RE SEEING A NUMBER OF OPERATORS I HAD MOVED FROM THE LEGACY MARKET INTO THE LEGAL MARKET- AND THAT FACILITATE CONSOLIDATED BY IT A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE CREATING REGULATED PATHWAYS FOR THOSE OPERATORS TO BECOME LEGITIMATE HOWEVER WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHO HAVE NOT YET CREATED THOSE PATHWAYS. SO I WOULD SAY THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT- OUTSTANDING COMPONENT THAT REQUIRES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SUPPORT FROM THE DEPARTMENT I'M IN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THOSE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO HELP THEM I'M ESTABLISH THOSE PATHWAYS AND CREATE. WE CAN CREATE THOSE PATHWAYS FOR LEGITIMATE BUSINESSES THAT SO THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT COMPONENT. I'M ASIDE FROM THAT AS THE DEPARTMENT IS NOW ESTABLISHED AND STABILIZED- AS WE LOOK AT OUR WORK I HAD A SIGNIFICANT PRIORITY FOR US IS READ REDUCING COSTS. OF PARTICIPATION IN THE LEGAL MARKET I'M WITHIN OUR CONTROL IS TO LOOK AT OUR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AND FIGURE OUT HOW. WE CAN STILL MEET THE OBJECTIVES OF THAT FRAMEWORK WOULD DO SO IN A WAY THAT REDUCES THE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES THAT A NUMBER OF OPERATORS PARTICULARLY SMALL LEGACY INEQUITY OPERATORS. ON FACE SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW- I CAN LESSEN ANYMORE BUT I THINK THOSE ARE THOSE ARE TOP OF MIND PRIORITIES. I APPRECIATE THAT MORE MADE DRIED OUT A LITTLE. I HAVE ONE OF THOSE DISTRICTS WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF CANNABIS GROWN AND THERE'S BIG SERVER THERE'S A LEGACY SMALL OUTDOOR FARMERS AND THEN. IT MONTEREY COUNTY GIVE PRIORITY TO GREENHOUSES AND AS A RESULT THAT'S WHERE. THERE IS A LOT GOING AND I VISITED A GREENHOUSE SOUTH OF CHU ARE COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. AND THE PRICES HAVE PLUNGED BELOW WHAT IS IN ESSENCE THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS THEN. IF THERE PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM. MAKING A CALCULATION TO COME INSIDE THAT DOESN'T. TOTALLY WORK AND I KNOW WHEN OUR CONVERSATION. THERE WERE A WHOLE HOST OF ISSUES THERE WAS THE ISSUE OF HAVING ENOUGH PLACES TO SELL THE PRODUCT TO MAKE IT A COMPLETE CYCLE. THERE WERE WERE ISSUES OF TAXATION AND WHETHER OR NOT. EVERY DIFFERENT LEVEL OF TAXATION MAKES IT HARD TO COMPETE THROUGH THE LEGAL SYSTEM. ARE THERE THINGS IN IN THOSE CATEGORIES THAT YOU MIGHT ADDRESS YOU'VE WE SHOULD ADDRESS TO MAKE SURE WE ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO COME WITHIN THE SYSTEM. SO YOUR POINT ABOUT MARKET HEALTH I THINK IS THE FIRST ONE OUT THERE IS CHALLENGES ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN WE HAVE ENORMOUS PRODUCTION CAPACITY BUT THERE ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT OR I SHOULD SAY SUFFICIENT OUTPUTS OUT FOR CONSUMERS TO ACCESS SAFE TESTED REGULATED PRODUCTS. SO THERE DOES NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF WORK RELATED TO I'M BALANCING- THE MARKET THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND ENSURING THAT THERE ARE SUFFICIENT OUTPUT SO THAT CONSUMERS CAN HAVE SAFE ACCESS. ONTO YOUR QUESTION ABOT TAX REFORM YES I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT IT LOOKS I KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS VERY FOCUSED ON THAT ISSUE- EVIDENCED BY THE NUMBER OF BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD. WELL WE ARE NOT. THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF IS NOT- THE TAX EXPERTS WHERE WE ARE APPROPRIATELY SITUATED TO WEIGH IN ON TAX REFORM IS THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT THE TAX STRUCTURE. PLACES ARE LICENSEES I'M AND AS IT STANDS TODAY THAT TAX STRUCTURE IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX- AND CREATES AN- ADMINISTRATION CHALLENGES FOR OUR LICENSEES AS WE SEE THAT TAX I'LL BE BACK. THIS IS A CHANGE I'M IN IT CAN HAVE. MORE CHALLENGES ON A SMALLER OPERATORS INTO YOUR DISTRICTS SENATOR I'M IT HAS SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES ON IT IS REALLY CUTE WE FELT BY- OUTDOOR SMALL FILTERS SO WE DO BELIEVE THE ISSUE OF TAX REFORM IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE OUT. THIS YEAR WE THINK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR FOCUS ON THAT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO PROVIDING A TECHNICAL SUPPORT NECESSARY TO GET SOMETHING ACROSS THE FINISH LINE THANK YOU- I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS ESTABLISHING A NEW INDUSTRIES- LAUGHTER. I DID A BILL OF THIS DEVICE THE STANDARDS SO THAT THEY WERE PROTESTING ACROSS THE STATE IN THIS YEAR THERE'S A NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE TO DO SICK WHILE MULTIPLE MULTIPLE TIMES AND THEY SHOULD HAVE TO DO ONCE. ARE IN THIS AND I'M TRYING TO DO THAT THIS. YEAR MORE QUESTIONS. I KNOW THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE AN AND FOR. TO AS PART OF THE- AND- ONE OF THE- THINGS WHEN I WAS RESOURCES SECRETARY. IS THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE WOULD PARTICIPATE WITH LOCAL SHERIFFS AND OTHER PEOPLE AND THERE WERE ISSUES OF. EXCESSIVE USE OF PESTICIDES WE WOULDN'T ALLOW ANYWHERE ELSE MASSIVE DIVERSIONS OF WATER. PEOPLE WITH GUNS THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN LICENSED ARE THERE WERE ALL THESE ISSUES INDEED FOR SMIT IN ONE OF THE REASONS I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD TO HAVE THE BALLOT MEASURES LIKE WHAT'S BRINGING IN HOUSE REGULATED NO PESTICIDES NO WATER DIVERSIONS THAT THOSE KIND OF THINGS. YOU'RE HAVING TO STAND UP ENFORCEMENT DIVISION THAT I THINK YOU TOLD ME IT WAS EIGHTY PEOPLE OR SOMETHING HOW'S THAT GOING HOW'S THAT WORKING WHAT KIND OF CASES OR ACTIONS. DO YOU UNDERTAKE OR SPECTER UNDERTAKE THROUGH NINE FORCING A DIVISION. YES WE DO HAVE AN ENFORCEMENT DIVISION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT THAT IS COMPRISED OF I BELIEVE SEVENTY SEVEN SWORN OFFICERS THAT ARE AUTHORIZED WE HAVE. A FIFTY SEVEN CURRENTLY HIRED- THAT ENFORCEMENT DIVISION DOES FOCUS ON CRIMINAL ACTIVITY UNLICENSED ACTIVITY. OUT WE ALSO HAVE INDIVIDUALS I WITHIN OUR COMPLIANCE DIVISION WHO FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING- OUR ENFORCEMENT RELATED TO. HIGH ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. PRODUCTION OF LEGAL PRODUCTION THAT HAS NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS TO THE CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND THE WATER BOARD. I'M IN THOSE COMPLIANCE STAFF SUPPORT ADMINISTRATIVE AND CIVIL PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ACTIVITY SO WE TAKE SORT OF A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH- BUT OUR ENFORCEMENT DIVISION OFF FROM THAT FROM THE CULTIVATION SIDE GENERALLY TENDS TO SUPPORT I C. F. W. AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN IT COMES TO. THE RATIFICATION OF CAMPUS PLANTS ARE SO FOCUSED ENFORCEMENT ON ILLEGAL CULTIVATION ANY LEGAL CULTIVATION THAT IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE ENVIRONMENT. THANK YOU- APPRECIATE YOUR BEARING WITH MY QUESTIONS AND ONCE AGAIN APPRECIATE YOUR SERVICE AND- IN EVEN THOUGH I. KNOW WE'RE STILL GOING TO HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOU WORKING TOGETHER AND ALL THESE EFFORTS. HIS LETTER. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED SENATOR COME MARKER. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEMAN- THANK YOU IT WAS ALSO- THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME EARLIER THIS WEEK TO MEET AND CHAT WITH ME I AM HAPPY THAT YOU'RE HERE TODAY I'M GONNA TRY AND FOCUS MY QUESTIONS- IN. AROUND THE EQUITY FEE WAIVER PROGRAM- SPACE SO I WHEN WE TALKED I SHARED WITH YOU- THAT I AM EXCITED ABOUT A LOCAL BUSINESS THAT IS IN MY DISTRICT ACTUALLY IN THE HEART OF THE THIRTY EIGHTH- THE GROW OUR OUR X. CANNABIS- STORE RUN BY KIKI A SISTER WHO REALLY SHARED HER. ELABORATE EXPERIENCE TRYING TO GET TO THE PLACE WHERE SHE'S ABLE TO OPEN THIS AMAZING FACILITY AND THE SUPPORT THAT SHE HAS FROM ALL OF US TO MAKE SURE THAT IT STAYS OPEN BUT OF COURSE IN THE PROCESS OF LEARNING ABOUT HER JOURNEY. YOU DO HEAR ABOUT- THE CHALLENGES THAT FOLKS HAVE WITH THE FE WAIVER PROGRAM AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION AND WE KNOW THAT IT HAS BEEN PROBLEMATIC IN SOME WAYS. SO IT WOULD BE. JUST SORT OF SHARE ARM YOUR THOUGHTS ON SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT STAKEHOLDERS HAVE IDENTIFIED AS REQUIRING IMPROVEMENT IN THE EMERGENCY CANNABIS EQUITY. FEE WAIVER REGULATIONS AND HOW THESE ISSUES ARE BEING OR HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED. ABSOLUTELY SO THE FEE WAIVER PROGRAM WHICH WAS- HAVE A PROGRAM A PORTION OF THAT. AND THAT WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE- SHORTLY AFTER THE BUDGET AS SEASON LAST LAST YEAR. WAS FOR THE DEPARTMENT WE WERE REQUIRED TO PUT IN PLACE I THROUGH URGENCY REGULATIONS IF YOU EVER PROGRAM BY JANUARY FIRST- AND IN DOING THAT THROUGH THE EMERGENCY REGULATION PROCESS WE DID HERE I SENATOR TO YOUR POINT CONCERNS RELATED TO A COUPLE OF COMPONENTS I SPECIFICALLY OF THAT PROGRAM. AND THE FIRST BEING THE BRIDE APPLICATION OF GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS THAT WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT PROGRAM AND THE SECOND BEING THE GROSS RECEIPTS CAP ON NOTED LEAST FOR RETAILERS OR- ACTUALLY ALL LICENSEES ACROSS THE STATE IN JURISDICTIONS. OUT WHERE IT WAS. IT REQUIRES MORE CAPITAL TO DO BUSINESS- AND WE HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ON THOSE POLICIES ON THE PREFERENCES WE ANTICIPATE MAKING MODIFICATIONS. YOU ARE FEE WAIVER PROGRAM. THROUGH OUR EMERGENCY REGULATION WE ADOPT WHICH WE HOPE TO DO SHORTLY IT IS THE MOST EXPEDITIOUS WAY. TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES AND THEN DOING ADDITIONAL OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT AS WE GO THROUGH THE REGULAR RULEMAKING PROCESS FOR THE FEE WAIVER PROGRAM I'M IN THE LONG RUN AS WELL AS THE DEFERRAL PROGRAM WHICH IS STATUTORILY MANDATED TO COME ON NINETEEN RIGHT FIRST. OF NEXT YEAR. GREAT- YOU MENTIONED ONE OF THE CHALLENGES BEING SORT OF THE BROAD APPLICATION OF THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS AND SO CURRENTLY AND ELIGIBILITY FOR FEE WAIVERS IS BASED ON AN APPLE CAN'T LIVING IN A DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED AREA- THAT IS OVERBROAD. I'M IN DATA FROM THE STATE LIBRARIAN SHOWS THAT THIS DEFINITION ENCOMPASSES ABOUT 80% OF THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE WHO COULD THEORETICALLY QUALIFY. FOR THE FEE WAIVER PROGRAM. SO I'D LOVE IT IF YOU COULD JUST DROP DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFICALLY ON HOW YOU PLAN TO EITHER NARROW THE ELIGIBILITY IN THIS CARE OF THE CATEGORIES SO THAT- THE INTENT OF THE STATUE IS MEANT. ABSOLUTELY YES. SO REALLY LOOKING AT ASTON DISTRACTS SPECIFICALLY SO WITHIN I'M IDENTIFIED COUNTIES HI AND IT A. M. I. LEVELS WITHIN THOSE CENSUS TRACTS AS WELL AS- I BELIEVE GRADUATION RATES- BUT I AM HAPPY TO CIRCLE BACK ON THAT SPECIFIC POINT- SEVERELY NARROWING IT TOO. HIGH CENSUS TRACTS WHERE YOU'VE SEEN THE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE WAR ON DRUGS IMPACTING AND THE COMMUNITY BROADLY- SO THAT WILL NARROW IT AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION OF ARREST. OR CONVICTION FOR THE INDIVIDUAL OR A MEMBER OF THEIR FAMILY. I SO REALLY LOOKING AT THOSE TWO CRITERIA WHICH ARE ADDITIONAL CRITERIA WITHIN THE PAST FEW THREE WAIVER PROGRAMS I'M AS ADDITIONAL WAYS TO NARROW THAT APPLICATION SO THAT WE ARE APPROPRIATELY CHARLIE TARGETING. THESE IN FINITE DOLLARS TOWARDS INDIVIDUALS. FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN MOST DISPROPORTIONATELY. IMPACTED BY THE WAR ON DRUGS. GREAT THANK YOU YOU KNOW AND IN MY CLASS IS VERY BROAD BASED ONE I BECAUSE I AM NOW THINKING BACK TO THE- HEARING I HAD ON A CANNABIS TAX REFORM AND WE HAD A REALLY GOOD A STRONG ARM. DIVERSE GROUP OF PANELISTS TO KIND OF TALK ABOUT THE INS AND THE OUTS OF CANNABIS ACROSS THE STATE FROM CULTIVATION AND PRODUCTION TO DISTRIBUTION AND- RETAIL AND WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN DO BETTER I THINK YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT- YOU KNOW IT SEEMED LIKE THIS WAS GOING TO BE MANNA FROM HEAVEN AND YET WE'RE STILL SORT OF. IN THIS LOG TRYING TO FIND. A BALANCE. FOR WHAT WE WERE EXPECTING AND HOPING FROM LEGALIZING CANNABIS IN THE REALITIES THAT WERE IN. AND THEN IN THE MIDST OF ALL THAT DISCUSSIONS AROUND EQUITY. SO FOR YOU WHAT DOES CANNOT BE CANNABIS EQUITY LOOK LIKE. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE FUTURE. WHAT IS ADEQUATE CAMPUS EQUITY LOOK LIKE I THINK IT LOOKS AT LIKE A DIVERSE MARKET LIKE OWNERS WHO ARE ABLE TO. OWNERS WHO HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED EITHER BY THE STATE OR BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AS HAVING BEEN NEGATIVELY. AND DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTED BY THE WAR ON DRUGS I'M REALIZING ACTUAL OWNERSHIP IN THOSE BUSINESSES AND GENERATING GENERATIONAL WEALTH I THINK IT ALSO MEANS A DIVERSE WORKFORCE- THOSE TWO THINGS I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT AND REFLECTED IN THE NUMBER OF LOCAL EQUITY PROGRAMS AND SOMETHING THAT THE STATE. I'M HAS STARTED TO EXPAND ALBION'S AS THOSE LOCAL PROGRAMS IN PART TO THAT FEE WAIVER PROGRAM SO REALLY A DIVERSE MARKET. GREAT WELL YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR THAT I JUST WANT TO CONTINUE TO ECHO- AND THIS IS NOT ALL PLACED ON YOU BUT YOU ARE HERE. THAT- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ALL WORK TOGETHER THE FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THIS SPACE AND MEANINGFUL TO EVERYONE WHO IS INTERESTED BECAUSE UNTIL WE DO THAT THERE WILL STILL BE AN UNREGULATED MARKET THAT IS THRIVING BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO BE INTERESTED IN. ALL OF THE HOOPS THAT WE ARE ASKING THEM TO JUMP THROUGH TO OPEN UP A BUSINESS. AND REALLY SORT OF MAINTAIN IT ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT ANY KIND OF SUPPORT SO ME AND I WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT. YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW FEDERAL. REGULATIONS AND BANKING WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT LIABILITY AND SECURITY WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT HOW FOLKS STILL HAVE TO DO A LOT OF THIS USING CASH- BUT ALL THOSE ARE STILL STRUGGLES. WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES BETWEEN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH AS IT RELATES TO CULTIVATION WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW THE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES WORK TOGETHER WHEN YOU HAVE SOME PORTION OF THE BUSINESS IN ONE SPACE AND THEN ANOTHER PORTION AND THE OTHER. AND ULTIMATELY. YOU KNOW THERE'S A CONSUMER. THE PERSON WHO JUST WANTS WHAT THEY WANT AND THEY WANT IT FOR A REALLY GOOD PRICE AND THEY DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT ALL OF THE- SAUSAGE MAKING- AND IF IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S TOO ARDUOUS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO SUPPORT THE SAUSAGE MAKING- AND SO. YOU HAVE A LARGE TASK AHEAD OF YOU. TO SORT ALL OF THAT OUT- AND I AM CERTAINLY WISHING YOU LUCK. THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU SENATOR COME AUTOMATIC VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU THANK YOU ON MANAGER- AND WE HAD A VERY- IN DEPTH ROBUST DISCUSSION YESTERDAY WE COVERED A LOT I IN PARTICULAR IN THE ENFORCEMENT AREA DIRECTOR ELIA AND I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH YOUR RESPONSES AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES JUST WENT A LITTLE DEEPER INTO THE ENFORCEMENT A QUESTION REGARDING THE ACTUAL CRIMINAL. CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ACTIVITY WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT DOWN THE OF THE LICENSING ISSUE ARE AND FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS VERY ENGAGE WITH THAT I JUST LIKE TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES- IN AGAIN RETURN TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY WITHOUT REGARD TO REGULATING CANNABIS BUSINESSES IN THEIR JURISDICTION. AND WE TOUCHED A LITTLE BIT ON IT YESTERDAY IN THE DISCUSSION THAT I DIDN'T GET A FEELING THAT YOU HAVE- I GUESS. KNOWLEDGE BEYOND JUST THE PRESENT AS TO WHETHER THERE WILL BE SOME SORT OF PRESSURE FOR STATEWIDE REQUIREMENT THAT PROHIBITS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. FROM HAVING SOME AUTHORITY OVER A CANNABIS ACTIVITIES IN THEIR JURISDICTION AND COULD YOU. JUST GIVE A ON YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT IN THE PRESENT IN WHAT MIGHT BE. GOING FORWARD BECAUSE OF THAT IS. SIGNIFICANT IN MY DISTRICT THOSE IN PARTICULAR I HAVE TO. THAT DO ALLOW IT- AND THEN THE BALANCE OF WRESTLING WITH IT AND HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH ACCESS I THINK I'D MENTIONED THAT TO YOU WHEN WE WERE. MEETING YESTERDAY- HAVING TO DO WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE STRUCTURED WITH ACCESS IN PARTICULAR TO SCHOOLS. ANNA IN PARTICULAR JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOLS SEEM TO BE ALL ON THE SAME ROUTES IN A VERY SHORT. DISTANCE AND ALL SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY AND CERTAINLY IN NORTH SAN DIEGO COUNTY WHICH ENCOMPASSES MY DISTRICT. SO I JUST HAVE TO GO BACK TO THAT QUESTION AND GET AGAIN YOUR PERSPECTIVE. ABSOLUTELY SENATOR. AS I SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME YESTERDAY AND AS I INDICATED IN OUR CONVERSATION I'M AS A LOCAL HAS A FORMER LOCAL REGULATOR I CAN SYMPATHIZE. WITH THOSE CONCERNS- WHEN WE DEVELOPED OUR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN SAN FRANCISCO I WE DID SO WITH AN EYE TOWARDS WANTING TO- HAVE SOME CONTROL AND OVERSIGHT AND UNDERSTANDING. OF THE BUSINESSES THAT WERE OPERATING IN OUR COMMUNITY- AND WE FELT THAT THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT. TO US AS A CITY AND WE WERE NOT CLEAR HOW THE STATE I WOULD SUPPORT US IN THAT EFFORT SO WE CREATED OUR OWN CONTROLS AND MECHANISMS TO ACCOMPLISH THOSE OBJECTIVES. I'M ON THE STATE LEVEL NOW I'LL WHAT WE HAVE WITHIN OUR CONTROL AS A DEPARTMENT. I IS TO SUPPORT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT SHOULD THEY WISH TO PROVIDE. LEGITIMATE PATHWAYS FOR BUSINESSES TO OPERATE WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONS HI INCLUDING THROUGH PROVIDING THEM WITH MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE IN THEIR JURISDICTION- WHETHER THAT BE RELATED TO THEIR LICENSING- BACKGROUND OR OVERALL COMPLIANCE. THROUGH THINGS LIKE TRACK AND TRACE DATA SO THOSE ARE THINGS THAT LIKE I SAID OUR WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT'S CONTROL AND AREAS WHERE WE STAND READY WILLING. TO SUPPORT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ON THAT JOURNEY ANSWERED THROUGH THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND THOSE RESOURCES. THANK YOU AND I THINK THAT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT KINDA IS SOMETHING ISSUE LAYING AND WAITING FOR A FUTURE PROBABLY ROBUST DISCUSSION AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS. OUR TO OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT WOULD REQUIRE CERTAINLY I'M MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IN MANY OF THE CITIES AND MY DISTRICT THEIR CONTRACT WITH THE SHERIFF. IN THOSE COSTS GO UP ANNUALLY SO HAVING A SPECIFIC. ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS OVERSEEING WHAT WOULD BE CANNABIS BUSINESSES AND SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES I THINK IS WHAT WEIGHS HEAVILY ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS A MIND IN AGAIN OF COURSE THE ACCESS TO- THE YOUTH- IT WOULD PROBABLY. BE A SIGNIFICANT ONE TWO THAT JUST PUTTING ON THE RECORD I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT THAT STANDARDS IF THERE'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT EVENTUALLY GAPS TO. OUR MORE DISCRETION- REQUIRED BY THE STATE- I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT STANDARDS ARE SET FORWARD ON WHAT EVIDENCE BASED WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ALLOW- THAT- LACK OF OVERSIGHT OR LACK OF ABILITY TO APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE THAT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. SO WITHOUT HAVING BUT I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOUR KNOWLEDGE VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOUR YOUR ENERGY IN PATTERSON PASSION TO PURSUE OF THE FOB. NEW ADVENTURE IN ON YOUR CAREER YOU WILL HAVE MY SUPPORT OF FOUR YEAR- CONFIRMATION AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR TAKING TIME THE VERY BUSY THERE YOU YEAH YES ALL. RESHAPE THE TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU VICE CHAIR- AND I WOULD AGREE WITH MICHAEL OBVIOUSLY. THE DEATH OF YOUR EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE ON A VERY COMPLICATED- PROGRAM AN ISSUE GIVEN THE LOCAL AND THE STATE- DIFFERING ROLES. I AM I DON'T THINK I HAVE MUCH TO ADD NEW WAVE QUESTIONS IS ALWAYS THE BENEFIT OF GOING LAST BUT- I DO WANT TO UNDERSCORE WHAT SENATOR CALM WATER SAID AND YOU WERE NOT SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT WE HAVE. OBVIOUSLY COLLEAGUES WITHIN THE SENATE THAT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH ABOUT THE EQUITY. OUT WAIVERS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS IN A WAY THAT IS- WELL EQUITABLE I AM I'M FOLLOW UP AT ANOTHER TIME I I'VE LOOKED PARTICULARLY AT THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND PROGRAM FUNDING AND I AND I REALLY FOUND YOU KNOW I'M I'M LOOKING TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THAT AND I MAY WORK WITH MY STAFF I DO HAVE STAFF THERE ARE SIMILAR DESPITE RESOURCES ALLOCATED TO DIFFERENT CITIES. AND WHAT THAT'S GOING TO PRODUCE WHAT THAT'S GOING TO WHAT THE OUTPUT IS GOING TO BE. I DID LOOK AT MY OWN CITY OBVIOUSLY- IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY INTEND TO USE THAT GRANT FUNDING FOR. AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHEN I LOOK AT. AND THEY GET. I THINK AWARDED SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND. WHEN I LOOK AT- I WULD ANTICIPATE THE CITY OF LA WOULD BE. MUCH LARGER. A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED AT MENDOCINO BUT THEN WHEN I THINK ABOUT. CULTIVATION OF CANNABIS I GATHER. DIFFERENT REGIONS IT'S GEOGRAPHICALLY A NEW ISSUE FOR US TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF IN CLEARLY I HAVE COLLEAGUES THAT HAVE A BETTER. WHERE THEY- GRAPHICALLY. WHICH IS SOME MORE RURAL COUNTIES AND THEN OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE GOT LARGE CITY SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES OAKLAND- SO I'LL BE INTERESTED TO SEE THE OUTCOME OF THOSE GRANTS BY THE SAME TOKEN I THEN LOOKED AT THE EQUITY WAIVERS HI GIVEN. DIGITAL NUMBER AND THEN THERE WERE MORE- WAIVERS GRANTED AND I LOOK AT YOU KNOW A HUNDRED TWENTY TWO IN HUMBOLDT AND- SIXTY TWO IN MID THE CNO AND- NINETEEN IN LOS ANGELES SO I. I WANT TO UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND YOU CAN'T BE AN APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON WHEN YOU LOOK AT DIFFERENT. AGAIN BASED ON THE GEOGRAPHY AND THIS ISSUE IS VERY DIFFERENT. FROM THE STANDARD ISSUES WE LOOK AT WHEN YOU APPLY TERMS LIKE EQUITY AND- WHAT RESET ITSELF I WANT TO DELVE INTO THAT A LITTLE MORE AND UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I LOOKED UP THE DECK DEFINITION WITHIN THE CODE AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING OF EQUITY. AND SO- HI HI MAY FOLLOW UP ON THAT BUT I WILL ADD TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID. IN TERMS OF THE COMPLEXITY AND BOY. IT IS REALLY GREAT TO HAVE SOMEONE THAT'S GOT THE BACKGROUND EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE TO DO THIS. AND TO HELP US UNDERSTAND AND ALSO THEN TO QUESTION HOW WE'RE DOING THIS. AND HOW IT MEETS THOSE GOALS IN THOSE MEASURES. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. AND I THINK OF WILL FOLLOW UP OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS.

YOU WERE ABLE TO PUT FORTH SO YOU'LL HAVE MY SUPPORT I JUST HAVE ONE- QUESTION CONCERNED ENOUGH ABOUT THE SPORTS WERE FORCED WAY DURING INITIATIVE. ARM YOUR COMMENT- OF GREAT CONCERN AND INTEREST TO THE BOARD GIVEN THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES AS PROPOSED IN I JUST LIKE TO HEAR A LITTLE MORE. OFTEN YOU ON THAT ISSUE I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHEN YOU ARE SITTING THERE AND YOU UNDERSTAND THOSE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES THAT YOU CAN SHARE THAT WITH US AS WE GO FORWARD. THAT WILL BE COMING ON A BIG ISSUE IN THAT YEAH YOU KNOW ABOUT THE COMING MONTHS. FOR THE LORD HAS YET TO TAKE A POSITION ON FOR INITIATIVES. ARE FILED BY THE- WITH THE AG TO DATE BUT RECOGNIZES THE POTENTIAL. FOR SPORTS WAGERING WILL IT WILL BE SIGNIFICANT AND REQUIRES. OUR ALL OF OUR ATTENTION- I THINK THE ONLY. ONE THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED FOR THE BALLOT EMBRACE BALLOT- IS A CALIFORNIA SPORTS AGERING REGULATION. I'M LAST UNLAWFUL GAMBLING GAMBLING ENFORCEMENT ACT- SO GONNA ACT. WELL I AM SUPPORTIVE OF IT- ARE YOU THINK YEAH IT MEANS A LOT TO THE SPORT AS WELL AS OTHER SPORTS BRINGS I THINK MORE INCOME TWO OF THE STATE- IN IN DIFFERENT WAYS OFTEN TAXES- AND SO- THIS LAN- IF AUTHORIZED- WILL- I THINK IT'LL BE PROBABLY ONLY ONE OF FOUR INITIATIVES LIKELY TO BE THE ONLY ONE THAT WILL BE. ON THE NOVEMBER EIGHTH. SUPPORTIVE OF THOSE SO. TO EARLY TO TELL THERE ARE PROS AND CONS WORK AS WE FURTHER ALONG WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK INTO IT FURTHER AND UNDERSTAND. AND THIS FUTURE BE WILL DEFINITELY TAKE A POSITION LOOKING OUT CERTAINLY I WILL BE LOOKING OUT TO HERE ON THE BOARDS OF REVIEW OF THAT AND CERTAINLY THE DISCUSSION OF THE PROS AND CONS IT SEEMS. MOST OF THE INFORMATION I RECEIVED IS THAT A REAL CONCERNED ABOUT. IMPACTING FROM THE EXISTING- AREAS AND ALSO OF POTENTIAL WITH WHEN WE HAVE THE PROBLEM WITH- YOU KNOW GAMBLING ADDICTION AND IF THAT IS GOING TO INCREASE THAT AND ESPECIALLY AMONGST OUR YOUTH. ARE SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS I'LL BE HOPING TO HEAR MORE ABOUT FROM YOUR BOARD ISSUE- DISCUSSING THOSE PROS AND CONS AND THE CONSEQUENCES.

THE NEXT SURE THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM. UM SO THANK YOU MR AFARIA I APOLOGIZE THAT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO FIND TIME- THIS WEEK TO. MEET BUT I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO READ. SOME OF YOUR STATEMENTS IN YOUR BIO AND- YOU LIKE I HAVE AND- SO I. FROM DECEMBER ONE QUESTION AND A COMMENT BUT THE QUESTION IS THAT- YOU KNOW THE ARGUMENT IS THAT GOOD HORSES ARE NOT COMING TO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE PURSES ARE NOT COMPETITIVE ENOUGH TO LURE THEM AND BECAUSE WE'RE KILLING THEM- YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH I KNOW YOU SAID THERE'S BEEN A FIFTY PERCENT. DECLINE IN A CRIME- FATALITIES WE DID HAVE A KENTUCKY DERBY WINNER- DIæN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO I WANT TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT IN IN IN WHAT WE DO ABOUT THIS. WELL ACTUALLY JUST TODAY AT THE JOCKEY CLUB- RELEASED A STATEMENT- AND TALKED ABOUT. EQUINE FATALITY THROUGH- THE EQUINE INJURY DATABASE- IT WAS RELEASED ON TODAY AND IT'S SAYING THAT THE INDUSTRY SWEEPING EFFORT TO IMPROVE RACING SAFETY ON A NUMBER OF FRONTS CONTINUES TO PAY DIVIDENDS. CALIFORNIA IS BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE WE'VE WE'RE WE'RE DOING SO WELL HERE- WITH AS I SAID R. FIFTY PERCENT- IF YOU WISH YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE ALL THE WAY DOWN. INTO WHERE WE USED TO PRACTICALITIES- I AM PROUD TO SAY- THIS REPORT IS PASSED AS I SAID THIRTY REGULATIONS ENHANCING PROTECTIONS. OVERALL WORK 50% DECLINE IN EQUINE FATALITIES. FURTHER DECREASING ANOTHER 40% JUST SINCE JANUARY ONE- REGULATORY CHANGES THAT INCLUDE THINGS LIKE LIMITATION ON JOINT INJECTIONS OF BEFORE WORKOUTS AND RACES WE MONITOR THIS CONSTANTLY DAILY LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF RIDING CROPS DURING RACE- WE LEAD WE LEAD THE NATION IN A MAIL ORDER STATES ARE FOLLOWING THROUGH- REQUIREMENTS THE FACT. EXAMINATIONS BEFORE WORKOUTS AND REYES. AND LASTLY WE HAVE WE CREATED A REVIEW PANEL- REGARDING A FROM THE FITNESS FROM TRAINING THE DAILY REYES AND THEN THERE'S A REVIEW PANEL TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE FIT ENOUGH TO RACE- YOUR QUESTION IS THERE THERE SEEM TO BE SOME OF THAT A COUPLE YEARS AGO- OF COURSE OWNERS WERE WERE TAKING THEIR HORSES ELSEWHERE- BECAUSE- THANKS THANK RARE RACES IN GENERAL. WE'RE NOT PAYING ENOUGH YOU KNOW NOT GETTING ENOUGH OF THEIR ATTENTION ON THEIR INTERESTS THAT'S STRANGE- THESE STAKEHOLDERS DIFFERENT RACING FACILITIES HAVE RAISED THEIR STAKES OF THEIR RACE RACING UP PERSONS- IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THIS LIST LAST TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THERE WERE MUCH HIGHER THAN TWENTY TWENTY AND PREVIOUS. AND SO WE DID SEE THAT MOMENT MUCH OF AN ACCENT- FROM- YOU KNOW WE OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE ONLY THREE OR FOUR THREE DAYS OF RACING OUT AND THAT WAS ONE OF THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WAS BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC- SOLD THERE ARE YOU KNOW THOSE. THOSE RACES ARE BEING FILLED- BUT THERE ARE THERE'S NOT AS DAYS. WHEN I UP YOURS GOING TO RE. THEY BE READY CERTIFIED A WEEK. NOT NOW SO. DO YOU THINK REALLY YOUR- ORDER KINDA NOT REALLY DO YOU THINK WE'RE GETTING- DO YOU THINK WE'RE GETTING GOOD HORSES. YES YES. WE'RE GETTING GOOD HORSES ALL OF THE WORST. WORST MILLION THREE THREE HORSES JUST WANT TO DO BODY THIS LAST WEEKEND. ONE THANK YOU IN FIRST AND SECOND- CALIFORNIA BRED- CALIFORNIA HORSES. NOT BRED. KENTUCKY BRED THE CALIFORNIA HORSES ONE. A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR RAISED- THE NEW BIKE WORLD CLASS SO WE HAVE HORSES COMING THAT ARE HEARING CALIFORNIA. THAT ARE RACING AND WE HAVE QUITE A FEW. MAJOR RAISE STAKES RACE. AFTER OUR FACILITIES. THE BILL MAHER SAMUDA BOWLING GATE A LAWSUIT. I DON'T SEE AS MUCH OF A DECLINE IN THAT RIGHT NOW. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU I AM. SO LIKE YOU I ALSO SORT OF GREW UP AROUND THIS INDUSTRY- AND SPENT TIME AT SANTA ANITA AND HOLLYWOOD PARK IN DELAMAR I'M UP AND DOWN AND I WILL SAY THAT I'VE SORT OF SEEN IT CHANGE- IN THE QUALITY. OF- OF HORSES AND IN IN THE PURSES AND THERE'S BEEN A SHIFT TO KIND OF TAKE THINGS AS YOU MENTIONED OUT OF THE COUNTRY. AND CERTAINLY BACK TO THE EAST- AND IF THIS IS GOING TO BE AN INDUSTRY THAT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT- YOU KNOW. I DO THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT I HOPE THAT YOUR BOARD WILL. CONTINUE TO BE INTERESTED IN- HOW WE ARE SUPPORTING. JOCKEYS BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT THERE'S A PREVALENCE OF- SUBSTANCE USE AND ABUSE. ARE BASED ON THE PRESSURES AND THE STRESS OF THE JOB- IN THE WEIGHT MANAGEMENT THAT THEY HAVE TO. SORT OF MONITOR- AND MAKING SURE THAT THEIR MEETING REQUIREMENTS TO REYES. AND THEN THE FACT THAT REVENUES HAVE GONE DOWN WITH RACETRACKS ACROSS THE STATE. WHICH IS REALLY IMPACTED- WORKERS ACROSS THE STATE WHO GENERATIONS. OF FAMILIES WHO HAD. LIVELIHOODS BECAUSE OF THIS INDUSTRY WHERE THEY WORK THEY'VE LIVED- YOU KNOW AFTER TRACK. CLOSE TO IT WORKING WITH HORSES- AND NOT WANTING TO. DECIMATE THAT INDUSTRY SO I WOULD JUST ASK THAT- YOU ALL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE I THINK THEY WILL BE PREVALENT- FOR HOW THIS INDUSTRY IS ABLE TO SUSTAIN IN THIS STATE. AND HOW WE ARE ABLE TO ATTRACT- BACK- COMPETITIVE HORSES WHO MAY BE FROM CALIFORNIA OR WHO HATE MAY NOT BUT THE GOAL IS TO HAVE AN EXPERIENCE THAT IS BOTH SAFE FOR THE OWNERS. AND OBVIOUSLY THE HORSES AS WELL AS FOR THE FOLKS THAT ARE STILL INTERESTED- IN- PARTICIPATING AND ATTENDING THESE PARTICULAR EVENTS- SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOU TODAY BUT I JUST NEEDED TO PUT ON THE RECORD MY CONTINUED CONCERNS- WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MY HOPE THAT YOU ALL WILL. CONTINUE TO DEVELOP DELVE INTO THESE ISSUES SO THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER LAYERED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FROM MISTER FARIA APPRECIATE- YOUR SERVICE IN YOUR APPEARING HERE TODAY I WANNA ASK SENATOR CALM WATERS WHO ARE PART OF A QUESTION A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY. AND THAT IS THAT THE F. CLOSE ALAMEDA BECAUSE THERE WAS A SPIKE IN FATALITIES IN TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN THE BOARD DECIDED TO HAVE A- A PLAN TO REDUCE THAT. M. O. THERE WAS A SIX MONTH PERMITTED IT WAS REVERSED IN IT AND GOT TO A YEAR AND THEN GOLDEN GATE FIELDS RACETRACKS ON INCREASE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHERE THERE'S A TOTAL OF TWENTY SEVEN DEATHS FROM MULTIPLE CAUSES AND THERE WAS A DEBATE ON THE BOARD IT'S WITH FORTY THREE AGAIN WITH GOLDEN GATE FIELDS RECEIVING SIX MONTHS VOTED FOR THAT AND THREE VOTED. R. FOR THREE MONTHS IN. A ARE YOU CITED THE FACT THAT THEIR STATISTICS SHOWING THERE'S A GREAT APPROVAL BUT IF THERE WAS TWENTY SEVEN DEATHS AT. AT GOLDEN GATE FIELDS LAST YEAR IT'S TOO SHORT TO DECIDE WHETHER OVER TIME THERE'S A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT SO. HOW DO YOU TALK ABOUT THIS WHAT'S ON THE BOARD AND- WHY YOU THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS REALLY. DOING THE RIGHT INTERVAL FOR REPORTS TO GET ON TOP OF THIS. WELL FIRST LET ME SAY I DIDN'T VOTE TO SUPPORT THANKS MONTHS LICENSE- THIS NEED THIRTEEN THIRTY TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY- AND SHORT TERM LICENSES. THREE MONTHS IS WHAT THE PROPOSAL WAS DISTRUSTFUL POSITIVE LOCAL AND STATEWIDE ECONOMIC IMPACT GENERATED FROM RAISED MEATS. APPROXIMATELY A THOUSAND WORKERS EACH RACING FACILITY. MANY OF WHICH ARE AFFORDED HOUSING ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO AN IMMEDIATE TERMINATION OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT HAVE THE ABILITY REGULATORY ABILITY TO SUSPEND RACING AND TRAINING AT A TRACK AT ANY TIME THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUES- AND WE CONTINUE TO EXERCISE THAT DISCRETION AS WE MONITOR RACING ACTIVITY- I ALSO BELIEVE THAT. WHICH WAS MENTIONED EARLIER FELLOW HORSES IF THEIR OWNERS AND TRAINERS FEEL THERE'S ONLY THREE MONTHS LICENSE THEY WON'T SPEND THE MONEY TO TRANSFER THEM HERE TRANSPORT THEM WHAT THE MOCK. UP THEY HAVE TO HAVE A PERIOD OF TIME OPERATE THEIR BUSINESS- AND THEY WILL MOVE OUT OF STATE. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASON WHY I DIDN'T FEEL THAT THREE MONTHS LICENSE- WE CAN WE CAN WE SEE A SPIKE IN. EQUINE DASSLER. WE CAN WE CAN SHUT IT DOWN AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING I BROUGHT THAT UP IN OUR IN OUR LAST MEETING. THAT WE SHOULD WILL MONITOR IT DAILY WHICH IS WHAT THE FUTURITY STAFF IS DOING AND STORAGE AND WORK AND WE SEE A SPIKE. WE CAN WE ALL TAKE MERGENCY ACTION AND WE WILL WE WILL WE WILL SUSPEND RACING. AND WE WILL LOOK INTO THE MATTER WHICH BERMAN. FIND OUT WHY THEY'RE SUCH AS BY WHAT WE'RE DOING THAT DAILY ANYWAY MY STOCKTON LOS ALAMEDA IS. STILL HAPPENING HOLDEN GATE- BUT WE FELT THAT THEY DIDN'T TURN AROUND- EVAN WAS ADEQUATE- THE WHAT WE SAW. OF HER TURN MATALAN IT'S AN IN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT BALANCE BECAUSE AT SOME POINT AND THERE'S TO JOBS AND IF THERE'S A SPIKE IN HORSES DEATHS GETS WEIGHED AGAINST WHAT THE REAL ISSUE SHOULD BE. WHY ARE SO MANY HORSES DYING AND IS THERE A WAY TO GET ON TOP OF IT AND IF THE GOLDEN GATE FIELDS IS TWENTY SEVEN DEATHS LAST YEAR. R. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S HARD TO MAKE A DEFINITIVE STATEMENT THEY'RE GETTING ON TOP OF IT FOR ONLY TWO MONTHS INTO THIS YEAR MAYBE THERE'S NO DEATHS AT THE FIRST TWO MONTHS. AND THAT COMES TO THE CONCLUSION BUT- I THINK WE AT THE RULES COMMITTEE TO THE CONFIRMATIONS AND THIS TURNS INTO AN OVERSIGHT PROCESS AND I'M- JUST HOPING THAT. YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE A GREAT CONCERN ABOUT THOSE DEATHS AND THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HOPE THE BOARD WILL ACT ON. IT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND- IF IN FACT. THE BOARD IS WILLING TO REALLY TAKE STRONG ACTION BECAUSE THERE'S A SPIKE IN DEATHS OVER THE SHORT TERM. THAT'S A STRONG STATEMENT AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT I JUST HEARD YOU SAY BUT- THE A SHORTAGE YOU CAN MAKE THE RENEWALS. WHEN THERE'S SUCH A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN. IN A CLIENT DEBTS IS SORT OF A STATEMENT THAT YOU WILL BE LOOKING AND THAT THEY HAVE TO DO THAT RATHER THAN FEELING THAT. THEY'RE JUST GOING TO BE GIVEN A PASS UNTIL THERE IS ANOTHER SPIKE SO. I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THIS EXCHANGE SO YOU UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN AND- AND YOU ACTED AS BEST AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU APPRECIATE. ABSOLUTELY FOUNDER WE CAN WE CAN TRAIN YOU SEE CHARLIE CONTINUES TO CLOSELY MONITOR. AND SCRUTINIZE ACTIVITIES AT THESE RACE TRACKS- AND WE WILL TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION. THERE'S NO THERE'S NOT A DAY GOES BY THAT WE ARE ALL OVER I FIRST GOT ON THIS BOARD WAS IT WILL NOT BE BUSINESS AS USUAL IT'S NOT LIKE THE OLD DAYS. AND SINCE THEN WE'VE ENACTED THIRTY REGULATIONS. M. EQUINE DEATHS ARE WAY DOWN. AND SO WE'RE WE'RE PROUD OF THAT NO WE DON'T. WE DON'T I DON'T LIKE TO SEE ONE HORSE. NO ONE ON THIS BOARD AND- BUT IT YEAH- YOU HAVE THESE ISSUES WELL I THINK THERE'S JUST ONE PLACE WHERE MAYBE WE'RE TALKING OVER PASSED EACH OTHER BECAUSE MAYBE IT LOS ONLY TO STARE DOWN BUT AT GOLDEN GATE FIELDS THEY WEREN'T SO DOWN AND THAT IS REALLY RECENT AND SO ARE IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS AND IT CAME UP IN AN EARLIER HEARING TODAY. THIRTY REGULATIONS DON'T MEAN ANYTHING. UNLESS THERE'S AN ABSOLUTE CHANGE IN WHAT THE OUTCOME IS SAID THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE WOULD BE. CONCERNED ABOUT I APPRECIATE WHEN I WAS THERE DOWN WE WERE DOWN FALL PREVIOUS YEAR AFTER LOS ALAMOS. AND SO WELL THAT'S WHAT I MEANT WHEN I SAID THEY WILL WORK ON SOME WAYS IT'S- I'M NOT. NECESSARILY SURE THAT'S THE THRESHOLD YOU ALWAYS WANT TO MEASURE AGAINST IT. I AGREE OKAY ANYWAY THANK YOU FOR THE EXTRA TRIP CHRISTIAN. INTERLAYER THANK YOU ARE YOU PREPARED I WANT I WANT TO GIVE US SENATOR GROVE ENOUGH TIME TO CATCH HER BREATH COMING FROM THE HEALTH COMMITTEE IN A DIFFERENT BUILDING SO. CENTER GROVE THANK YOU GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME AND CATCH MY BREATH AND LET SENATOR LAYERED FINISH. I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND WE HAVE TO HAVE I WAS MY A TWELVE YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER WHO FOLLOWS RESOURCING. AND FANATICALLY SHE EVEN DID A REPORT IN A TIMELINE ON BOB BAFFERT IN MEDINA SPIRIT. I WHICH HE MADE ALL OF US VERY WELL EDUCATED ON- BEEN SINCE I'M NOT HER- YOU GET TWO QUESTIONS- SO THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THESE. SO HOW DO YOU BALANCE ECHOING SAFETY ON THE TRACK OPERATIONS WHEN CONSIDERING WHETHER TO GRANT LICENSES ON TRACKS. AND THAT'S MY QUESTION I DO APOLOGIZE IF THAT'S ALREADY BEEN ASKED BECAUSE I WAS IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE. YOU NEED TO SO YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LICENSE THROUGH A REGULAR TRAINER YES SIR. HOW DO YOU BALANCE THE OPERATIONS OF GIVING WHEN CONSIDERING THOSE LICENSES AT WHAT'S THE PROCESS TO GO THROUGH THAT AND D. IS THEIR BACKGROUNDS ARE REGULATORY PROCESSES WHERE YOU ADD DO BACKGROUND CHECKS ON THE INDIVIDUALS THE TRAINERS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. ABSOLUTELY SIGNIFICANT BACKGROUND CHECKS. OUT YOUR BROUGHT UP. THE TRAINER BOB BAFFERT PAUL PAUL FRANK FRANK- YOU KNOW HE IS HAVING ISSUES OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW WE'VE WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING BACK- BUT- THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT BACKGROUND CHECKS ON EVEN MORE SCREWED THAN SINCE I'VE BEEN ON THE SPORT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS- THAT I AM ENJOYING TO SEE IS THE WITH THE CURRENT LICENSED TRAINERS WE'RE PUSHING AND PUSHING AND DOING MOR CONTINUING EDUCATION. SO NOT ONLY WERE THEY WHEN THEY WERE LICENSED THEY HAVE A CERTAIN EDUCATION THINGS WE'RE CONTINUING TO BROADEN THAT EDUCATION- EACH EACH YEAR EACH SEASON- ALL THESE TRIPS ARE. LICENSED TRAINERS IN THE STATE- AND WE'VE GOT MORE EDUCATION ACTUALLY FOR OWNERS AS WELL FORCE OWNERS. BUT- ACTUALLY I'M NOT SURE OF YOUR ASKING ME A BOB OR JUST IN. NO SIR I WAS JUST MAKING A COMMENT THAT IF MY TWELVE YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER WAS HERE SHE WOULD BE ASKING YOU. ABOUT BOB. AN OF. THERE ARE THERE ARE QUITE A BIT OF THREE MAKE INCLUDING THEIR ASSISTANT TRAINERS AND- BACKTRACKS ABSOLUTELY AND THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE IS THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE AND CONTROVERSY GOING ON ABOUT SPORTS AND WE TRINA BETTING FEDERAL OUT OF HORSERACING TRACKS TO OFFER SUCH BETTING BETTING AND WHAT OVERSIGHT ROLE IF ANY DO YOU THINK THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD SHOULD HAVE- AT OF ANY SPORTS BETTING ACTIVITY. WELL WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THAT EARLIER- I USED YOU KNOW WORD IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL. THE PROS AND CONS WE DON'T KNOW ALL OF THE USERS YEAH WE HAVEN'T SEEN THESE LARGEST LATIUM- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IT'LL BE ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. A TO SEE IF THAT WILL EVEN BE APPROVED OR NOT- AND THEN WE'LL GO FROM THERE THANKS WE HAVE NOT TAKEN THE CRB HAS NOT TAKEN A POSITION ON. BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T KNOW ALL THE FACTS. THERE WILL DEFINITELY WE WILL DEFINITELY BE ALL. YEAH YOU THAT YOUR PLAYER% IN IT LIKE WHAT WOULD THINK YOUR ROLE WOULD BE. WELL I I'M SURE THERE WILL BE BECAUSE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. WHERE YOU BRING AB BRICK AND MORTAR FACILITIES ALSO AND SO. WE WILL BE WE WILL WE'RE GRANTING LICENSES BREKKEN MORE FACILITIES AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT HOUSING YOU KNOW HAVING THIS- WAGERING AS WELL AS SONG OFFLINE ONLINE- THE LITTLE PEOPLE THOUGHT VERY MUCH SO WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY INVOLVED. BUT IT'S JUST TOO EARLY TO TELL I AM NOT AN EXPERT AS TO WHAT YOU KNOW THESE ISSUES WILL BE BOTH PROS AND CONS AND WHAT THE REGULATION RIGHT REGULATORY STOCK CLARK- I SEE THE BENEFIT THOUGH I PERSONALLY FEEL. IT'LL WHAT IS MORE FORCING THEM TO HANDLE THIS BET ON HORSES AT OUR FACILITIES IN THE STATE IS LARGE OUTSIDE OF THE STATE. AND SO THERE'S. ALREADY OUT THROUGH WAGERING- DIFFERENT FACILITY- ALL ONLINE. YEAH YOU CAN BET ON YOUR PHONE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD- AND WE BENEFIT FROM WE DO GET A PIECE OF THAT ANIMAL. SO THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR GROWTH- THANK YOU. AND I THANK YOU SO MUCH I ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN ON THE RULES COMMITTEE FOR AWHILE AND APPRECIATE YOUR SERVICE I REMEMBER PREVIOUS- OUR CONFIRMATIONS AND- UNANIMOUS SUPPORT BOTH AT THE RULES COMMITTEE AND ON THE FLOOR- AND I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND AND SAY I DO THINK IT IS TRUE THAT THE REFORMS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD HAVE. HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS I FOLLOW THIS I REPRESENT ARE A PART OF SAN DIEGO THAT DEL MAR AND THAT HISTORY AND THAT LEGACY SO THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE ON LIMITING THE USE OF RIDING CROP. CHANGES TO THE DESIGN- INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF COURSE COURSES FITNESS BEFORE THE RACES RESTRICTIONS ALL MEDICATIONS. REVIEW OF VETERINARY RECORDS ALL THOSE THINGS YOU TALKED ABOUT THE POOR SOME POOR POST MORTEM. REVIEW OF THE FATALITIES- ARE ALL TOOLS THAT WERE NEEDED TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF DEATHS. ARE BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN IT FLUCTUATE YEAR BY YEAR END AND ALSO. OF THE SCANNERS IN THE TOOLS AVAILABLE- NOT THROUGHOUT THE STATE UNFORTUNATELY I KNOW WE'RE WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS A POSSIBILITY SO I THINK IT HAS WORKED TO MAKE. CALIFORNIA A LEADER WHICH HAS HAD SOME PROBABLY ECONOMIC IMPACTS ON- THE PEOPLE WHO BRING THEIR HORSES HERE TO RACE I THINK OUR OUR STANDARDS ARE HIGHER. NEVER THE LESS I THINK THERE'S MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WITH IT YOU'RE WELL AWARE OF BECAUSE- I WHO STILL THINK. AND THAT IS A BIG EXTREME. BACK TO- SENATOR GLAZERS COMMENT ABOUT LOSS ALAMEDA DOES I REMEMBER WHEN WE SAW OF SPIKE IT WASN'T A SIGNIFICANT SPIKE BUT ANY COURSE DEATH ISSUE SAID IS SOMETHING TO. BE CONCERNED ABOUT BUT I REMEMBER- AFTER A FEW IN SAN DIEGO IN DEL MAR I WENT OUT AND DID A TOUR THE TRACK AND TALK TO FOLKS AND LOOKED AT. EVERYTHING THAT WENT INTO PREPARING A TRACK FOR- NOT ONLY FOR RACING DAY BUT FOR- THE PRACTICE AND THE TRAINING. DO YOU- DID YOU NOTICE- WERE YOU ABLE ON THE BOARD WHEN THAT WHEN THE BOARD OVERTURNED ITS ORIGINAL. ODD DECISION ON THE ONE YEAR LICENSE- RELATED TO LOSS ALAMEDA IS. WAS THERE AN EVALUATION DONE OF THE TRACK- WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME IS THERE ANY. DO YOU WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE FINALITY SAID THAT TRACK WAS OR ANALYSIS DONE AND IMPROVEMENTS MADE TO THE TRUCK CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THAT IF YOU REMEMBER. SOLD OF MOST RECENTLY WITH THESE QUIET AND WE ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE SCIENCE LAST YEAR. AGAIN FUTURE B. HAS HAS BEEN IN DAILY CONTACT WITH LOS ALAMOS- AND IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATE BUT THEY HAVE THE TRACK ITSELF IS IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATE SAFETY ENHANCEMENTS AND CONSULTED EXPERTS AND REYES- BOTH IN THE RACING SURFACES- THEY'VE NOW ASKED THEM VETERINARY RESEARCH THEY'VE ASKED UC DAVIS TO GET INVOLVED STUDYING- INTERESTING THINGS LIKE THE LONG BAR FRACTURES. IN QUARTER HORSES- THAT'S COMING OFF OF- THE WAY IN WHICH QUARTER HORSES RACE- IN FULL- WITH A- TOWBAR- BATTER THAT TECHNICALLY IS A LITTLE OVER MY SKIS- BUT ALL I KNOW THAT- THE BEST EXPERTS IN. THE TRACK SURFACE WHEN ASKED TO LOOK AT THIS LOOK AT IT IMMEDIATELY- AND THEY'VE LOOKED AT ALL LAST YEAR AND- THERE WAS A SPIKE AGAIN AND WE DON'T KNOW WHY I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL- OF THE LARGE BONE. BONES THAT HAVE BEEN- IN THE HORSES THEMSELVES FROM. EITHER PREEXISTING CONDITIONS OR AND SO WE'RE GETTING TO THE BTTOM OF IT. FUTURE B. IS ON IT EVERY DAY LOS AMIGOS CURRENTLY AND SO AGAIN. IF WE DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE. THEY'VE GOT THIS FALL WHETHER IT'S THE TRACK SERVICE WE DON'T THINK IT'S THE TRACK SURFACE. BUT IF IT IS- OR WHAT OTHER REASONS THERE ARE WE WILL. CALL AN EMERGENCY MEETING ARE CHARMING TALKED ABOUT A WEEK AGO WE WERE IN A COUPLE WEEKS AGO ON WORK OR ALL OVER THE FLOOR. THANK YOU HI. KNOW A LOT GOES INTO IT AND I KNOW THE EVALUATION OF THE TRACKS AND THEN I KNOW WHAT THE PROTOCOL IS ON THE TRACK. ON RACE DAY AND- OBVIOUS YEAH. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GETTING MORE. TOOLS I JUST HOPE WE CONTINUE TO PUSH OURSELVES TO DO BETTER AND BETTER AND TO FIGURE IT OUT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IT IS A SCIENCE- IN TERMS OF HOW THOSE TRACKS OR LOOKED AT BUT I. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE WE ALWAYS ARE GOING TO ASK WHEN WE SEE THIS BIKE AND WE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE WAITING FOR ANSWERS FROM THE- THE BOARD AND YOUR EXPERTS THAT TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. I WILL FOLLOW UP ON A QUESTION- THAT. SENATOR GROWTH- ASK ASK. AND TALKED ABOUT RELATED TO- BELFORD AND THE SUSPENSION- I WANTED HOW DO YOU BALANCE THE RIGHT OF DUE PROCESS AND MONITORING OF TRAINERS WITH THE KNOWN HISTORY OF VIOLATIONS BECAUSE I READ IN SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A KNOWN HISTORY OF PROBLEMS THERE. AND ALONG THOSE LINES THEN WHAT IS THE PLAN TO ENSURE THAT THESE HORSES ARE CARED FOR PROPERLY AT HAND I KNOW AND HOW DOES THAT IMPACT EMPLOYEES BECAUSE WHEN YOU TAKE SOMEONE OF THAT STATURE WITH THAT MANY COURSES. AND THEY'RE SUSPENDED IT HAS AN IMPACT ON OBVIOUSLY- THE EMPLOYEES INTO THE TRAINERS BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACT BUT HOW ARE THOSE FORCES THEN. HOW DO YOU BALANCE THAT. AT THE MONITORING OF THE TRAINERS AS WELL AS AS DUE PROCESS. IN A CASE LIKE THIS IS MY THIS IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. MISTER BAFFERT HAS ALREADY OTHER TWO TRAINERS TWO DIFFERENT TRAINERS THAT WILL TAKE OVER HIS ENTIRE STATE- YEAH SANTA ANITA. I WHICH IS PRIMARY BASE OF OPERATIONS- AND SOLD OF I FIGURES YOU KNOW HE'S HE HE HAS TO SHUT DOWN- AND SO I'M SURE THAT THE OTHER TRAINERS WILL TRY AND- GET A HIGHER HIS SOME OF HIS PEOPLE THERE THE- ACT HANDLERS. OR SEIZE THE BACKSTRETCH WORKERS- IF NOT THEY'LL GET WORK SOMEWHERE ELSE YOU'RE ALWAYS NEEDED THERE'S BEEN A SHORTAGE. OF BACKSTRETCH WORKERS. WE THINK BECAUSE A COVERT SUCH SUCKS BUT- YOU KNOW CAT HORSE RACING HAS THE REST RULE- WITH BEN WITH ALL STATE'S RACING AND WITH OTHER COMMISSIONS RACING COMMISSIONS AND SO WE WILL LIVE BY WHATEVER ELSE IS THE SUSPENSION OF NINETY DAYS OF THE KENTUCKY HORSE RACING COMMISSION AS- AS- GIVEN TO. OF THE STRAFFORD WE ALSO WILL LIVE BY THAT AND UP WITH THIS RECIPROCITY RULES. I DON'T. KNOW IF I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. LIKE A PART OF YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU- I ONLY HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION AND UNFORTUNATELY IT HAS TO DO WITH ANOTHER SUSPENSION WHICH IS THE EC ONE MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND I'LL BE QUITE HONEST I DIDN'T KNOW OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD AND THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD. I WONDER I KNOW YOU'RE TWO VERY SEPARATE BOARDS BUT OBVIOUSLY WITH THE SUSPENSION OF- THE DIRECTOR OF THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR- AND THEN OF COURSE THE HORSE RACING BOARD HAS EXPRESSED GREAT CONFIDENCE IN IN. THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR THE EQUINOX MEDICAL DIRECTOR. OUT WHAT IS THIS INTERACTION- BETWEEN THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD AND THEN THE IMPACT IT HAS ON THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD. AND WHAT ROLE DO YOU HAVE IN SELECTING OR APPROVING THE EXONE MEDICAL DIRECTOR I'M JUST CURIOUS. WELL FIRST OF ALL I AM NOT AN EXPERT IN VETERINARY MEDICINE. SO I CANNOT SPEAK TO THE FULL COMPLEXITY OF THESE ISSUES- BROUGHT ON BY THE VETERINARY- BOARD ST BERNARD BOARD AND- SEIZURE VIA OUR HOWEVER I FULLY SUPPORT DR GLORIA- DUTIES PROFESSIONAL EXCELLENCE AND EXPERTISE. IS DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT. TO EQUINE HEALTH AND SAFETY- BEYOND THAT THE BATTER IS RIGHT NOW BEING DECIDED BY THE COURTS. AND- I DON'T- PART OF IT IS A POTENTIAL PENDING LITIGATION SO THE BOARD WERE WERE- I CANNOT SAY FURTHER- YOU KNOW- WHAT WILL BE HANDED DOWN HERE BUT- I'VE I FEEL THAT IT'S- THERE'S DEFINITELY A DISCONNECT- I'M I'M SORRY THAT THEY HAD TO SUSPEND DOCTOR BLAIR. WITHOUT ALLOWING HIM DUE PROCESS- AND WE DO STAND BEHIND- WE I DO. STAND BEHIND DR GLORIA OF THE BORDER THIS VOTE AND PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THEIR UNANIMOUS SUPPORT AND CONFIDENCE IN DR YEAH AS THE EQUINE MEDICAL DIRECTOR. IN DO OUR RESPECTIVE HIM AS ONE OF THE MOST TO FEED VETERINARIANS IN THE COUNTRY- AND FLOW IN OUR CREATION FOR HIS LONGSTANDING COMMITMENT TO. THE ONE OR. AND REALLY ANSWERED OUR ACTIONS I'M SORRY NOW I'M KIDDING I WOULD JUST SAY TO YOU AND YOU KNOW AND ALL THE YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE- DOING CONFIRMATIONS WE MAKE APPOINTMENTS TO ALL OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION BOARDS AS THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE CLEARLY THE GOVERNOR MAKES APPOINTMENTS TO THOSE BOARDS AND ADD TO BE QUITE HONEST I NEVER ACTUALLY. HAVE HAD AN EXAMPLE OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN AN ACTION TAKEN BY. ABOARD THE VETERINARY- BOARD. AND THE IMPACT THAT THEN I SEE IT HAS ON THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD SO THIS IS A FIRST FOR ME TO SEE THIS PLAY OUT OBVIOUSLY IT MAY BE FOR YOU AS WELL BUT FOR US WHEN WE ARE. BONTA MADE THE VISUALS AND THE HORSE RACING HAS STEP. HISTORY OF BEING ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT SAFETY ON TRACKS AND HORSE DEATHS AND THEN WE SEE THE INTERSECTION OF THE VETERINARY BOARD AND SOME QUESTION LIKE YOU I DON'T THINK ANY OF US UP HERE OR IN A POSITION TO- VALUE WAIT AND ACTION BY THE VETERINARY BOARD ANYMORE THAT WAS THEN WE ARE ABOUT ASSESSING RACE TRACK QUALITY AND- THE ISSUE. MIGHT BE THERE BUT I WANT TO RAISE IT TO YOU BECAUSE- WE ARE THE ONES THAT WILL GET THE CALLS ABOUT- HORSE DEATHS AND- WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO OVERSEE AND MONITOR WHAT'S HAPPENING AT AT THE TRACKS. OF WHICH I BELIEVE IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR CALIFORNIA HISTORY AND LEGACY AND OF COURSE I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD ART RIGHTS FREQUENTLY- SO. A DIFFERENT KIND OF INTEREST SO I JUST WANT TO PUT IT TO YOU BECAUSE I KNOW IF THE BOARD HAS EXPRESSED GREAT SUPPORT OF DOCTOR BLADE A AND- AND I HAVE NO REASON. TO THINK THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A BETTER ASSESSMENT OF HIS QUALITIES- THAN I DO. BUT I JUST HAVE TO PUT IT THERE IS A QUESTION AND SAY WE ARE GOING TO PROBABLY CONTINUE TO MONITOR NOW THIS INTERSECTION. HI AS THINGS MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT ABOUT THAT AS WELL- I THINK WE WERE ALL VERY STE. STE ABOUT THAT WOULD YOU JUST EXPLAIN. I'M HOW VETERINARY BOARD YOU KNOW. AND HOW THIS HAPPENED WITH DOCTOR. I DO KNOW THERE IS ON GOING HEARINGS- AND SO- REGARDING THE ACT ACCUSATIONS- REMAINS OF. SO WILL WILL MONITOR THE START WERE VERY MUCH INVOLVED. IN THE MEANTIME THERE TOO YOU KNOW VERY QUALIFIED. PROFESSIONAL. DOCTORS FROM UC DAVIS ARE ARE THEY CAN FOR SETTING AND- DOING GREAT WORK IN IN DR PLACE PLACE WELL IN A THANK YOU AND I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT UC DAVIS IS PROBABLY. THE FOREMOST. SCHOOL AS IT RELATES TO ASK ONE OF CARE- ECCENTRICITY. IF YOU WOULD JUST ON MY BEHALF I WILL NOT SPEAK FOR MY COLLEAGUES BUT IF YOU WILL CARRY BACK TO THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD THAT WE THAT I AT LEAST DID EXPRESS THIS CONCERN ABOUT THE JUXTAPOSITION. AND THE ROLE THAT THE HORSE RACING BOARD TOK IN EXPRESSING THEIR SUPPORT AND YET HERE WE ARE STILL OUT HERE WITH THE CONCERN ABOUT AN ACTION THE VETERINARY BOARD TOOK I THINK I JUST NEED TO SAY THAT FOR THE RECORD. AND CERTAINLY MOVE ON BECAUSE I DO THINK THE RECORD REFLECTS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN PART OF AN INCREDIBLE- CHANGE IN TERMS OF. THE ACTIONS TAKEN AT THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD TO ENHANCE AND SUPPORT THE HEALTH OF HORSES SO I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IS REFLECTED ON THE RECORD TOO BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL OF THAT BUT IF YOU CARRY THAT MESSAGE BACK TO THE BOARD. RELATED TO THIS CONCERN THAT WE CANNOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT IS OBVIOUSLY AND AS YOU SAID- I HEARING PROCESS AND THE COURTS SO. I AND I WANT TO END ON ON BEFORE WE GO TO THE PUBLIC.
