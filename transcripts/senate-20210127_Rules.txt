THIS COMMITTEE IN THE ENTIRE SENATE ROUTINELY DEALS WITH LEGISLATION THAT AFFECTS THE LIVES OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE TODAY WE HAVE THE DUTY TO CONSIDER THE APPOINTMENT OF SOMEONE WHO IF APPROVED BY US AND BY OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY WILL DIRECTLY REPRESENT THOSE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. IT'S A MOMENT THAT REQUIRES OUR UTMOST DUE DILIGENCE. OUR JOB IS MADE EASIER BY THE FACT THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAS APPOINTED TO SERVICE CALIFORNIA'S NEXT SECRETARY OF STATE OUR FRIEND OUR COLLEAGUE. DR SHIRLEY WEBER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DR SHIRLEY WEBER. I'LL HAVE MORE TO SAY THROUGHOUT THE PROCEEDINGS OF COURSE BEFORE ANYONE PARTICIPATING WHO'S NOT FAMILIAR WITH DOCTOR WEBER THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM HER. AND TO HEAR FROM OTHERS ABOUT HER AND HER QUALIFICATIONS AND HER VISION FOR THIS IMPORTANT JOB. UNLIKE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THE GOVERNOR CAN FACE. WHEN OFTEN THERE JUST ISN'T ARE THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD OPTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM THIS APPOINTMENT PROCESS HAS BEEN ONE FOR GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAPPEN TO HAVE AN OVER ABUNDANCE OF GOOD OPTIONS IN FRONT OF HIM. THERE ARE SO MANY POTENTIAL APPOINTEES WHO NOT ONLY HAVE THE EXPERIENCE AND COMMITMENT TO SUCCEED. BUT HE WOULD ALSO REFLECT AND ADVANCE THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND ARE STATEWIDE OFFICES. TODAY WE FOCUS ON THE FUTURE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE AND HOW DR SHIRLEY WEBER WOULD HELP THIS VITAL OFFICE MAXIMIZE VOTER PARTICIPATION. AND MAINTAIN ELECTION INTEGRITY INSURED DISCLOSURE AND TRANSPARENCY IN CAMPAIGNS AND LOBBYING. AND ACTIVELY HELP BUSINESSES WITH THE FORMS AND FILINGS THEY NEED TO START AND SUCCEED. ESPECIALLY DURING THESE TOUGH TIMES AND SO WITH THAT. LET ME ARE WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER DR WEBER. I WANT TO INVITE HER TO MAKE OPENING COMMENTS INTRODUCED-HERSELF AND HER FAMILY. AND THEN I WILL GO TO RULES COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS AND DIALOGUE DR WEBER. WELCOME THANK YOU MADAM OF. PRO TEM AND I'M HONORED TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY AND I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE RULES COMMITTEE FOR- SCHEDULING THIS HEARING ON THIS SO ON THIS PARTICULAR RECOMMENDED APPOINTMENT- I WANT TO INTRODUCE MY FAMILY THAT SHE WITH ME. MY DAUGHTER AKELA WEBER DR KILO WEBER IS HERE. AND MY SON TO KILL WEBER THESE ARE MY HEART IN MY THROB AND THEY REPRESENT. MY FAMILY MY IMMEDIATE COR FAMILY. ALSO WITH THEM IS MY NEPHEW DON. EDWARD NASH JUNIOR. AND MY GRANDDAUGHTER BRIANA BANKS MY DOCTOR GRANDDAUGHTER DID OF NOW HEADS AND SO SHE WAS TWO YEARS OLD. AND SO I HAVE WITH THEM THEY'RE HERE REPRESENTING THE NASCO MAN. OF WHICH IS A HUGE ORGANIZATION A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE WE ARE OF EACH OTHER. AND SO I'M SURE THAT THEY REPRESENT TO MY SIX- BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHO ARE PROBABLY WATCHING ONLINE. AND A HOST OF RELATIVES AND FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS TO KEEP TEXTING ME ABOUT WHAT THEY SEE. SO I AM HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY WITH YOU. I WANT TO GIVE MY THANKS TO THE GOVERNOR- FOR. TAPPING ME ON THE- IN LOOKING AT ME IS THE POTENTIAL REPLACEMENT FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE- TO SAY TO YOU THAT IN SEPTEMBER I HAD NO IDEA THAT I'D BE SITTING HERE TODAY IS REALLY AN UNDERSTATEMENT- BECAUSE I WAS BUSY DOING THE WORK. OF THE ASSEMBLY. DOING THE WORK OF THE SEVENTY NINTH AND MAKING A DIFFERENCE I THINK FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO I WAS HONORED WHEN HE ASKED ME TO THINK ABOUT BEING THE SECRETARY OF STATE. AND I HAD MY VISITATIONS TO LET YOU KNOW FOR SURE. BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S AN AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY. AT ANY TIME YOU THE FIRST AND I HADN'T EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT THE FACT THAT I'D BE THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN TO EVER BE SECRETARY OF STATE- IN A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY YEARS. AND THAT I'D BE THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN. AND ONLY TWO ONE OF TWO WOMEN WHO HAVE ACTUALLY SERVICE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN. SO THAT'S A TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY AND A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY. TO BASICALLY STEP INTO AN AREA. AND TO TRY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE A DIFFERENT KIND OF DIFFERENCES OF ALL ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT I'VE BEEN PROBABLY STEPPING INTO NEW PLACES AND DIFFERENT PLACES MY WHOLE LIFE. ANW ARE THE CHILD OF A SHARECROPPER FROM HOPE ARKANSAS. IN YOUR FAMILY PHILLIES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BECAUSE SOMEONE IS GOING TO LYNCH YOUR FATHER AND HE HAS TO LEAVE HIS FAMILY HIS WIFE AND SIX CHILDREN. AS HE COMES TO CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW THAT YOUR LIFE IS GOING TO BE FEEL WOULD FIRST THE NEW OPPORTUNITIES AND TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES. AND SUCH IS THE CASE HAVE BEEN MY LIFE TO BE RAISED IN THE PUEBLOS OF PROJECTS OF LOS ANGELES. AND HAVE THE BENEFITS OF SOME GREAT TEACHERS AND GREAT MENTORS- THEN TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND GO TO UCLA AND HAVE THE WONDERS OF CALIFORNIA TO GIVE ME TO ALLOW ME TO ACQUIRE THREE DEGREES AND ONLY A HUNDRED A TWELVE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. IS AN AMAZING GIFT THAT MY FATHER COULD NEVER HAVE JUMPED UP AS HE LEFT HOPE ARKANSAS. BUT EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT THE VALUES OF MY FAMILY THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN MY IN MY LIFE. THAT IS IMPORTANT TO BE. EDUCATED IT'S IMPORTANT BE SMART. BUT IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO KIEV AND TO SERVE. AND TO BE A CITIZEN AND TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS OF LOADING. YOU KNOW MY FAMILY OF MY FATHER NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO VOTE. WHEN HE WAS IN ARKANSAS SO HE WAS IN HIS LATE THIRTIES TWENTY FINALLY REGISTER TO VOTE. MY GRANDFATHER ON MY FATHER'S SIDE AND HIS WHAT AND MY GRANDMOTHER. NEVER VOTED IN THEIR LIFE. BECAUSE THEY DIED BEFORE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. IS THAT THEY NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO EVERGOING TO PULL TO VOTE. AND MANY OF MY FATHER'S BROTHERS AND SISTERS WITH THE SAME WAY. MOST OF THEM WERE ALMOST ILLITERATE MY FATHER WAS HE COULD READ A LITTLE BIT BUT NOT A LOT. BUT HE KNEW THE VALUE OF WHAT HE HAD MISSED OUT ON. AND WHY THIS COUNTRY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GIVE IT TO HIM AND HIS FAMILY. AND HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS OF VOTING. SO HE VOTED EVERY ELECTION. AND WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY CAME FOR MY MOM TO WORK ON THE POLE SHE DID. AND WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY CAME BECAUSE WE HAD KNOWN NO LIBRARY NO. REC CENTER IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD TO HOLD A BIG VOTING PLACE. AND THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL NOW HAVE LUNCH FOR BREAKFAST AND LUNCH. BUT THE POLLING PLACE BECAME THREE FIFTY ONE WEST FORTY FIFTH STREET. MY HOME. IN DEPTH THOUGHT VOTING WAS TOO IMPORTANT PUT IN THE GARAGE SO WE MOVED ALL OUR FURNITURE OUT EVERY ELECTION. IN VOTING TOOK PLACE IN OUR LIVING ROOM. SO I GREW UP WITH THE IDEA OF UNDERSTANDING THE VALUE VOTING. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO NOT BE ABLE TO VOTE. I LIVE IN A COMMUNITY THAT HAD LIMITED VOTING IN TERMS OF PEOPLE NOT HAVING FAITH IN THE PROCESS OF VOTING. NOT BELIEVING THAT IT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND DESPITE THAT. MY FATHER MOTHER BELIEVE SO STRONGLY IN VOTING THEY ENCOURAGED EVERYONE TO VOTE. BANKERS ALL OF THE CHILDREN AND THE GRANDCHILDREN THEIR NIECES AND NEPHEWS VOTE. BECAUSE HE REALIZE WHAT LIMIT HE HAD IN DEFENDING HIS LIFE. WHEN HE WAS CHALLENGED AT THE WAY STATION BECAUSE HE WAS THEY WERE CHEATING HIM OUT OF HIS ANNUAL MONEY. AND HE FOUGHT BACK. AND FIGHTING BACK WOULD MAKE HIS DEATH. AND YET HE STOOD FIRM BECAUSE HE BELIEVED IN THAT IT HE KNEW THAT HE WANTED HIS CHILDREN HAVE A PLACE WITH IT WAS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND ACCESS. SO I GREW UP WITH THIS KIND OF A COMMITMENT THAT VOTING IS IMPORTANT. DIGNITY IS IMPORTANT. BEING JUST FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY IS IMPORTANT. AND I KNEW THAT WHEN I FINISH TO UCLA. AND GOT MY FINAL DEGREE AND WAS TEACHING. THAT I WOULD BE WHAT THEY CALL A SCHOLAR ACTIVISTS. I'D BE SOMEONE WHO NOT TO STUDY THE BOOKS AND WENT INTO MY OWN COCOON. AND TAUGHT MY CLASSES. BUT I DO MY BEST TO ELEVATE MY COMMUNITY. TO EDUCATE THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THEY HAD ACCESS TO THOSE THINGS. SO WHEN I'M CONFRONTED WITH THE ISSUE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE. AND THEN THE RESPONSIBILITY IT HAS. IT'S ALMOST KIND OF IRONIC THAT A MAN WHO NEVER WAS ALLOWED TO VOTE. NOW HAS A DAUGHTER WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE VOTES OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT IS TURN OF EVENTS. WHAT A CHANGE. IN CALIFORNIA. AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THAT IS AN AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY THAT IS FILLED WITH MANY CHALLENGES AS WE FACE THE- THE CRISIS TODAY. WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO DISCREDIT VOTING WANT TO ALTER VOTING WANTED MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO VOTE. MAKE IT HARD FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE. AND WE SAW IN THE LAST ELECTION SOME TRAGEDIES THAT WE SAW. BUT WE ALSO SAW CALIFORNIA RISE TO THE OCCASION. YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN A PART OF WITH WRITING LEGISLATION AND I'VE BEEN ON THE BRETTLER ELECTIONS COMMITTEE FOR YEARS. WE WILL LEGISLATION THAT WENT FORTH AND PEOPLE THOUGHT WELL MAYBE WE'LL USE IT MAYBE WE WON'T. YOU HAVE AN OPTION TO DO IT OR NOT TO DO IF YOU WANTED TO MAIL BALLOTS AND SO FORTH AND SO ON. SO WHEN COLE BECAME AND ELECTION. CALIFORNIA WAS PREPARED. YOU KNOW WE HAD A GLITCH IS ENOUGH THINGS THAT FELL APART BUT IN THE END. WITH THE GENERAL ELECTION WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT WE HAD OVER 80% OF OUR PEOPLE VOTING. UNBELIEVABLE AND I CAN REMEMBER TIMES WHEN WE WERE PRAYING FOR FORTY AND FIFTY. WITH 80% VOTING. WE ALSO HAD TO SAVE VOTING. WE HAD MULTIPLE DAYS VOTING AVAILABILITY FOR FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO VOTE. COMFORTABLY WITHOUT HAVING TO BE STRESSED ABOUT VOTING. AND WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT IT. AND I'M HOPING THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS OFFICE THAT WE WILL TAKE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED. AND BEGIN TO INSTITUTIONALIZE MORE OF IT. IN OUR OWN PRACTICES TO MAKE SURE THAT VOTING IS X. PASSABLE. THAT WE REACH EVERY IT NEEDS TO THAT HAS ABOUT. TO WANTS TO. AND THAT MY TASK MAKE SURE WE ALL. HAVE THOSE SAFE PLACE BUT ALSO THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE. AND THAT EVERY CONCERN IS A MAJOR CONCERN. BECAUSE WHEN YOU OVERLOOK THE SMALL THINGS IT IS THE SMALL THINGS THAT THAT THAT KNOCKED YOU OUT. THAT HAVE A TENDENCY TO DESTROY THE GOOD THINGS THAT WE HAVE. AND THERE'S NO QUESTION WE'RE IN A TIME IN OUR HISTORY WE MUST. FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR VOTING SYSTEM IS SECURE. THAT THOSE WHO SHOULD BE VOTING ARE VOTING. THAT WE MAKE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOLKS THAT THERE IS NO INTIMIDATION THERE WAS NO EFFORT TO DESTROY PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO HAVE THEIR INPUT. BECAUSE THEIR VOICE IS IMPORTANT AND I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN YOUR VICE IS TAKEN AWAY. AND SO I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY WITH YOU TO TALK TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I'VE TALKED WITH MOST OF YOU ABOUT ELECTIONS YOU KNOW MY PASSION ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW HOW WE GOING TO WORK VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THINGS WE'VE INSTITUTED WILL CONTINUE TO BE THERE. THAT CYBER SECURITY IS ALWAYS A JOB THAT NEVER ENDS. AND I'VE TALKED TO SEVERAL TIMES OUR CYBER SECURITY FOLKS TO REALIZE THAT. THIS IS THIS IS SOMETHING YOU DO EVERY DAY ALL THE TIME THAT WE HAVE TO STAY ON TOP OF WITH WORKING. WE HAVE TO MAKE A TRUE THOUGH VOTING ROLLS ARE ACCURATE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. AND AND WE'VE SEEN SOME SOME GROWTH IN SOME AREAS BUT CLEARLY WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE SOME CHALLENGES WITH THAT. BUT I'M USUALLY IN INVOLVED IN CONCERNED ABOUT BUSINESS AND MAKING SURE THAT CALIFORNIA IS BECAUSE FRIENDLY BIZ AT BUSY. BUSY FRIENDLY. THAT WE HAVE ALL FOR FORTUNE FORTUNE WE HAVE BASICALLY COMPUTERIZED A LOT ABOUT THINGS BECAUSE OF. THAT ONLY A PUBLIC OF WHAT WAS IN PLACE. AND TO BEGIN TO POSSIBLY ASK BUSINESSES WERE HOW WELL WE'RE DOING. CAN WE MOVE FORWARD. WITH THE WHAT KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES DO WE HAVE TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA IS A PLACE FOR BUSINESS FRIENDLY. AND I. AND I COME AT THAT NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT MOST FOLKS BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE. AND IT IS IN MANY WAYS IN THE STATE. BUT IT'S ALSO THE LIFE OF PEOPLE. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN. MY DAD DROVE FROM FORTY FIFTH AND BROADWAY. OVER TO THE CITY OF COMMERCE. AND SOLVE EVERY YEAR. THE ELIMINATION OF BUSINESSES. THAT. WERE IMPORTANT SO FAR STONE. COULD BE IF. IT'LL BE STEEL HE WORKED IN LAW AND SAW THE COMPANY ONE ONE. AND THE FEAR THAT IT HAD IN THE OF MIND TO THOSE WHO HARD ALL THEIR LIVES TO HAVE SOME KIND OF THE INSECURITY THIS FEAR UNFORTUNATELY FOR MY DAD HE RETIRED FROM THIRTY THREE YEARS AT THE BLISS OF LOCKING IN MARCH OF NINETEEN. NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE. ALEX AND EMMA HAS PLANT CLOSE IN JUNE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE. HE MISSED ABOUT TWO MONTHS. HE WAS SO HAPPY. BUT HE FELT VERY BAD ABOUT ALL THE YOUNG MAN WHO WORKED IN THAT PLANT. WHO WOULD NOT HAVE A PLACE ANYMORE. SO I'M VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO BE BUSINESS FRIENDLY WE NEED TO HAVE GOOD JOBS WE NEED TO BE PUT TO ENCOURAGE THOSE WITH THE ACT. AND TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO BASICALLY DO BUSINESS AND TO LISTEN TO THEM AND THEIR CONCERNS WITH REGARDS TO WHAT WE'RE NOT DOING RIGHT. IN ORDER TO MAKE IT EASIER BECAUSE IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOT JUST AS THE BOTTOM LINE BUT BECAUSE OF THE LIVES OF THE INDIVIDUALS. AND AS A KID I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEBODY LAID OFF. WITH SOMEBODY WHEN THERE'S A CUT BACK. BUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FAMILY WHAT HAPPENS TO THE SECURITY OF THE FAMILY. SO WE'LL BE WORKING TO BASICALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE RESPONSIVE TO THE THOSE ISSUES THAT ARE CRITICAL. AND LASTLY OF COURSE AND MOST FOLKS DON'T KNOW I'M I'M PROBABLY MOST EXCITED ABOUT THE ARCHIVES OF CALIFORNIA. OF YOU KNOW THAT IN ITSELF. JENNIFER AS AN EDUCATOR. FIRES ME UP WAS DELAYED AS ALSO FIRES HIM UP. AND AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE KNOWING WHO YOU ARE IS CRITICAL. KNOWING YOUR PAST. PEOPLE KNOWING WHAT CALIFORNIA WAS ABOUT AND WHAT AND THE CHALLENGES WE FACE IN THE THINGS WE OVERCOME. ARE IMPORTANT. AND THE FACT THAT PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND. THAT THE CIVIC NATURE OF OUR COUNTRY. IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I'M HOPEFUL THAT IN THIS IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE. WE WILL BE ABLE TO HIGHLIGHT OUR OUR- OUR BECAUSE- THEY WILL BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA. BUT WE WILL BE ABLE TO HELP OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD CIVIC EDUCATION. OF OUR TALK TO OUR EDUCATORS ABOUT THAT TO STRENGTHEN THAT IN THE STRENGTH OF THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO BE PROUD OF BEING A CALIFORNIA. AND PROUD OF THE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY UNIQUE. AND IMPORTANT FOR US. AND THAT DRIVES US TO THE END TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE A DECISION THAT IS DIFFERENT WITH REGARDS TO HUMANITY THAT'S THEIR- SUCH AS I'M GOING TO CONCLUDE WITH THAT BY SIMPLY SAYING I AM HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY- AS I. SAID WHEN I FIRST WAS TAPPED ON THE SHOULDER SOMETHING CAN SECRETARY OF STATE. MMHM I DON'T KNOW. AND AS I TALK TO SOME OF MY FRIENDS I SAID WELL. IT COULD BE A GOOD THING. AND AS I LOOKED MORE INTO IT I REALIZED MY GOODNESS. I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS ALL OF MY LIFE. AND THIS IS PROBABLY WHERE I SHOULD BE. BECAUSE THERE'S A TREMENDOUS NEED FOR PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE STRONGLY IN THIS COUNTRY. WHO BELIEVE STRONGLY IN THE RIGHT TO VOTE. WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO VOTE. BUT ALSO UNDERSTANDS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T VOTE. AND TO COME OUT OF THAT GENERATION AND TO SHARE THAT WITH THIS GENERATION. THAT THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ACT THAT WE MUST ENGAGE IN. I WOULD CONSIDER IT AN HONOR TO BE ABLE. TO DO SO. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. THANK YOU DR WEBER- IT IS A GOOD TO HEAR YOUR- IT'S ALSO GOOD TO SEE YOUR FAMILY. LET ME START AND GO TO OUR MEMBERS AND I'M GONNA GO TO SENATOR BATES FIRST BY. SENATOR BATES I'M MAKING AN ASSUMPTION YOU ARE I DIDN'T LOOK FOR YOUR RACE TEN CM ALREADY NOT FOLLOWING MY RULES. BUT HI I WANT TO MAKE SURE- AND START WITH YOU AS WE TYPICALLY HAVE DONE- REMOTELY SO CENTER BATES ALTERNATE OVER TO YOU. THANK YOU. CAN YOU HEAR CAN YOU HEAR EIGHT. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN SENATOR OKAY GREAT AND BY THE WAY ARE. THE SCREEN ON WELL YOU KNOW I MIGHT. THANK YOU IN ON MY COMPUTER DOES NOT MAKE RAISE YOUR HAND ON WAITED SEE THAT. BUT LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING GRADUALLY RETURNS DOT. EVERYWHERE INSURANCE MEDICAL INSURER THE HOBBIT BRAND OF OR THE COURSE OF MY- I'M HERE THIS CONGRESS NAPA. UNDER WARRANTY WONDERFUL CUP EASTERN THE OTHER DAY ARE YOU WHILE SHARING ONE HALF WHEN YOU'RE YOUNGER ALL I KNOW IS HERE. UNDER EXISTING SCRATCHY WATER AREAS AND. CONCERNED ABOUT AND WE SHARE THAT BOTTLE REALLY ONE OF THE- TOPOLA ABOUT WHAT YOU. HERE ARE NEVER OF THE CHAU YES YEARS THAT. THEY ARE COUNTING BALLOTS THAT WAS A BIG ISSUE ARE REGARDING THE ABILITY TO HAVE THAT OVERSIGHT THAT'S GUARANTEED OUR- YOU KNOW MEMBERS OF OUR PUBLIC OF BY ELECTION CURRENT CARD THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE A CLOSE ENOUGH TO OBSERVE SIGNATURES ON BALLOTS. THAT'S PRETTY CRITICAL YEAH WE UNDERSTAND THAT DURING THE CALL THAT THAT WAS PROBLEMATIC. SO I'M SECRETARY VIDEO ACTUALLY RELEASED A NEW VERSION ELECTION OBSERVATION RIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES AND GAVE A LOT OF DISCRETION TO THE INDIVIDUAL- REGISTERED VOTERS AND SOME OF THAT WORK IS SUNDAY BEGINNING BECAUSE IT WAS REQUIRED TO COME TO DEVELOP. THAT AREA DON'T THINK A DESIGNATED AREA WHERE THEY WOULD THEY WOULD STAND WE'RE GOING TO BE COMING OUT OF THE COLD AND YOU ARE. RECALLS HOPEFULLY AS WE APPROACH THE SPECIAL ACTIONS THAT CUTTING OUT THE ANSWER WE ARE THE ACTUAL TWENTY TWENTY TWO ELECTIONS LEAD LIKE YOU TO ADDRESS. HOW YOU WILL ENSURE THAT WHAT IS NOT REQUIRED TO BUY THE ELECTION CODE LEARNING NOT THE OBSERVATIONS LIKE HOW YOU'RE GOING TO ENSURE ACROSS THE BOARD BATCH BATCH OR LET'S SAY THAT VERSION AND I'LL RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR. ELECTION OBSERVERS THIS RETURN TO WHAT WAS AND CHAMPION THAT WENT OFF THE LEGISLATION THAT CREATED THE RIGHTS TO BE ARE WE CAN ARE VISUAL ON YOUR- THE BALLOTS THEMSELVES SO THAT WE HAVE. AN ANSWER TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS INTENTIONALLY SET UP SO THEY COULDN'T SEE AND VALIDATE- ACTUAL- YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT LEADING A LEGITIMATE BALLOTS BECAUSE IT WAS NOT SO BABY NATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA I IT WAS. IN OUR SOME OF. THE ALL OF THE PRE AND SOME OF THE- REGISTER. THAT IT WAS A HUGE ISSUE THE NATION OUR WE'VE GOT A THEIR- IN TERMS OF ROLLING TO AND HOW PEOPLE DIALED YET AND SHE- THE FACT OUR ELECTIONS THIS NAY.

BELIEVE IN THERE'S NO FOR THAT THEN I'LL BE WE GO BACK TO THE RULES THAT WE HAVE- WITH REGARD TO BE BIG OBSERVERS BEING ABLE TO OBSERVE THE ELECTION PROCESS AND SO FORTH AND SO ON SO- BUT I THINK IT'S LONG AS WHEN COLE WOULD WE HAVE TO. OBVIOUSLY THOSE ARE SOME UNUSUAL SITUATIONS THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH AT THE TIME- SO I SEE NO REASON WHY WE WOULD RETAIN OF THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO OBSERVE THAT WE WOULD GO GO BACK ON OUR OUR COMMITMENT TO THE- TO THE LAW THAT WAS THERE. WHAT THEY YOU ARE SURE. BY THINK THE IT GOT A LITTLE. DURING THAT TIME KEEPING HEAR ME MORE CLEARLY. I THINK IT WAS AN- KIND OF AN OLDER. REACTION TERMS OF THE ARE THE ONLY TO OBSERVE AND NOT. BE A- IT. BOB TRANSMISSION ARE YES. SO I'M GLAD THAT YOU WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT I KNOW IN OUR CONVERSATION SHE DID MENTION THAT YOU WOULD TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT MOTOR VOTER.

IS TO WAS SO OF TO ME IN THE TO SUBJECTS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THAT I WANTED TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS TO PUT WHAT YOU SAID ON THE RECORD AND THEN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT DID ALL FOR A BIT BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT. THE COMMITMENT TO EVERYBODY VOTING- OF CYBER SECURITY THE RECOGNITION THAT THERE'S THE BUSINESS SIDE OF THE HOUSE AND I WAS POSITIVE THAT THE ARCHIVES WOULD RISE TO THE LEVEL THAT YOU WOULD MENTION THAT IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT. THE ED AND SO I JUST WANT TO SAY YOU ANSWERED MY QUESTION TO YOU ON THE RECORD IN A VERY GOOD WAY I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH YOUR ANSWERS AND IF AND WHEN YOU ARE CONFIRMED- I DID BILLS ON THE ARCHIVES OF THE ASSEMBLY I WILL FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU A SECRETARY OF STATE THANKS FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE. AND THANKS FOR MAKING YOUR PERSONAL STORY SO IMPORTANT AS A COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY AND VOTING I THINK THAT REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE HELLO MADAM CHAIR SHE ANSWERED ALL MY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU CENTER LATER. THANK YOU- MISTRUST YEMEN SURE WE CAN. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM. SO JUST A COUPLE THINGS JUST ASIDE WE'RE TAKING NOTES AND I'M HOPING THIS WAS AS A COVETING- BUT IN TERMS OF. THE OFFICE. QUICKLY ACCOMMODATING CANNONS WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL SO LIKE- I DON'T KNOW. IN AUGUST A FRIEND OF MINE SHE'S AN EDUCATOR SHE'S NOT A POLITICIAN BUT SHE OPENS UP HER ACCOUNT FOR ELECTION YEAR AND CLOSE IT DOWN AND SHE CALLED ME BECAUSE I GOT THIS PAPERWORK. YOU KNOW AND I'M I'M GONNA MILLION A MEASURE HOW LONG IT'S GONNA TAKE IT TAKE IT I'M A NICE PERSON SHOULD ALWAYS BRING IT BRING AND DROP OFF MY HOUSE AND I WILL PERSONALLY DELIVER IT. ON MONDAY SESSION ONLY BRINGS HER SHE BRINGS TO OTHER CANDIDATES WHICH I DIDN'T ASK FOR AND- SO I DROP HIM OFF THE FIRST PERSON LIKE IT OUR LATER TEXT ME SCOTT THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT'S GREAT AND I WAS IMPRESSED BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE NINETY MINUTES. THE OTHER TWO NEVER EVER. NOTHING AND THEN- I DROP IT OFF A SECOND TIME NOTHING THEY HAD SOMEBODY FIVE FROM SACRAMENTO DROP IN THE BOX NOTHING AND THEN I DID CALL THE SECRETARY STATE AND- TO HIS CREDIT HE HE HOPPED ON THERE. I'M HOPING IT'S A COVERT THING WITH PEOPLE WORKING REMOTELY BUT THAT WAS KIND OF TROUBLING BECAUSE IT TOOK SIX WEEKS AND- SO I JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW THAT. THE OTHER THING. AND NOT THAT HAVE NECESSARILY- WAYS TO FIX IT I DON'T THINK THE WEBSITES VERY INTUITIVE. AND SO. WHICH WEBSITE- THE SECRETARY OF STATE WEBSITE CRITICALLY ON THE ON THE POLITICAL STUFF IT'S QUITE QUITE CONFUSING AT TIMES. I'VE LEARNED HOW TO NAVIGATE IT BUT IN AND I'M SURE YOU GOT HIGHER PRIORITIES BUT I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. THEN WE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE THE PLEASURE OF YOU KNOW ASKING YOU QUESTIONS AND OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE. THE RESPONSIBILITY OF VOTING BUT THEY DON'T ATTACH YOUR QUESTION SO THIS IS ACTUALLY A QUESTION FROM. A COLLEAGUE OF MINE. AND I KNOW YOU HAVE AN ANSWER FOR SO I'M JUST GOING TO BE A HIT OUT THE PARK HOW WOULD YOUR OFFICE ENCOURAGE SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS TO PRE REGISTER AND VOTE IN ELECTIONS. THAT THEY MIGHT QUALIFY TO PARTICIPATE IN PRIOR TO TURNING EIGHTEEN AND THEN THERE'S A SECOND ONE JUST pSTATE WERE YOU IN YOUR OFFICE OFFER SUPPORT TO MR PENALTIES. AND SCHOOL BOARDS CONSIDERING PROPOSALS TO INCLUDE YOUNG PEOPLE. IN LOCAL ELECTIONS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY INCLUDING THEM IN ELECTIONS I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT DIFFERENT PROPOSALS IN THE PAST TO ALLOW UP. AS LOW AS SIXTEEN TO VOTE IN SCHOOL BOARD ELECTIONS THAT'S WHAT I THINK THAT QUESTION MEANS OKAY OKAY- WE DO HAVE AS YOU KNOW IN IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE WE HAVE AN OUTREACH PROGRAM THAT WE'VE ALL OF THAT ARE VOTED ON A COUPLE OF TIMES SO. WITH REGARDS TO INDIVIDUALS GOING INTO OUR SCHOOLS WE HAVE A REGULAR PROGRAM THAT GOES INTO THE SCHOOLS THAT REGISTERED SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD AHEAD OF TIME IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO VOTE- THERE'S OF A PROGRAM THAT DOES THAT I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN IN. IN MY OWN SCHOOLS WITH US SECRETARY PADILLA- IT DOES ADD LINCOLN AND MORSE HIGH SCHOOL WHEN WE WENT INTO BASICALLY ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO VOTE SO. THAT'S A PART OF A PLAN THAT'S A PART OF THE LEGISLATION THAT WE WILL BE PASSED TO ENSURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE EARLY BEGIN TO VOTE AND DO HAT- ONE OF THE MEMBERS ASKED ABOUT THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THE SEVENTEEN SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS VOTING. THAT HAS COME UP A COUPLE TIMES AND OF COURSE MORE RECENTLY WAS ON THE BALLOT AND IT WAS VOTED DOWN. SO IF WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IF YOU NEED A LOT MORE INFORMATION AND IT MAY BE THE FACT THAT. IT WAS ON THE BALLOT IN THERE WASN'T SO MUCH ON ABOUT THE PEOPLE DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO IT AND IT JUST GOT BALLOT FATIGUE CAN DECIDE TO GO DOWN BECAUSE- IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE SOMETHING THAT THEY NEED TO DO THAT MOMENT. BUT THERE'S ONGOING CONVERSATION ABOUT IT AND THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER NOT THOSE WHO ARE IN CERTAIN MUNICIPALITIES ALLOWING. SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS TO VOTE IN LIKE SCHOOL BOARD ELECTIONS VERSUS OTHER ELECTIONS AND- AND WHETHER NOT THAT MEETS THE STANDARD. REGARDS TO THAN THE OVERALL NATIONAL STANDARDS AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT AT SOME POINT. MAYBE LITIGATED WITH REGARDS TO THE VOTING RIGHTS AND WITH THE NOT THERE ARE THESE THAT I KNOW NATIONALLY TO TRY TO GET SOME STANDARDS. WHICH I THINK COULD BE HELPFUL BUT ALSO COULD BE DANGEROUS AT THE SAME TIME. IF YOU HAVE SOME STANDARDS THAT ARE THAT ARE THAT ARE BEING APPLIED BEYOND. WHAT IS REQUIRED RIGHT NOW AND SO- SO I THINK WE'LL STILL HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT BUT I pTHE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD VOTE. BEFORE THEIR ELECTION BECAUSE THEY FELT THEY DIDN'T WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO. ENTER INTO IT UNTIL THEY WERE EATING. YEAH WE HAVE A LOT OF A- CAN. ISSUES WITH. A CAL. YOUR KNOW. AT ONE POINT SAY YOU CAN. SMOKE IT YOU IN THE- TWENTIES. WITH YOU CAN VOTE. IF SEVEN. IF PEOPLE SO IF. CAN YOU SIXTEEN YOU'RE- CAN MAKE THE DECISIONS WHICH CAN MAKE THE DECISIONS ABOUT. BUT SMOKING OR SOMETHING. AND SO WE HAVE A LOT OF THAT GOING ON AND SO. AT SOME POINT THERE ARE WE HAVE WE HAVE A CONVERSATION ALMOST EVERY UNIT IN THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE. AND SOME GETS THROUGH SOME DOES NOT- BUT- I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER RULES ARE WITH REGARDS WITH THAT WE OF THAT THEY'RE ENFORCED. AND THAT WE SUPPORT THEM. GREAT- CAME AGAIN NOT NOT MY QUESTION A COLLEAGUE'S QUESTION BUT THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THAT. SO I WAS SOMEBODY THAT ACTUALLY IN A I WAS IN THE MINORITY IN MY **** IS I'VE- I'VE VOTED TO DO ALL MAIL IN BALLOTS- WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF HER FOR IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC RIGHT ONE. INTO ABOUT 70% OF OUR VOTERS ALREADY GO ABSENTEE BALLOTS SO I FELT LIKE WE WERE IN A PRETTY GOOD POSITION. TO DO THAT AND I KNOW THAT FOR. CHALLENGES IN PENNSYLVANIA AND OTHER PLACES BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE WE HAVE. THE ONE THING I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT- JUST FROM ALL THE CALLS A GUY. IS CLEANING UP THE VOTER ROLLS. BECAUSE ALL THESE BALLOTS ARE FLOODING INCLUDING MY HOUSE THERE'S BALLOTS YOU CAME TO MY HOUSE THERE FOR MY DAUGHTER AND- AND- HER HUSBAND THAT. LIVE LIVE OUT OF STATE AND- SO AND I KNOW WE HAVE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS IN IN L. A. COUNTY WHAT WHAT CAN YOU DO TO TAKE TO CLEAN THAT UP. SO THERE IS MORE CONFIDENCE. YOU KNOW IN IN THE ELECTION PROCESS BECAUSE- IF WE IF WE DON'T GET ELECTIONS RIGHT THEN YOU KNOW WE HAVE NO CREDIBILITY IN IN THE WAY WE GOVERN SO QUESTION YEAH I KNOW THAT THERE'S A THERE'S AN ISSUE IN LA MY UNDERSTANDING WHAT I TALK TO STAFF ABOUT IT IN AND WE'LL LOOK INTO IT IS THAT IT'S GOTTEN BETTER- IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO SCRUB THE ROLE SO MAKING SURE THAT THE- THAT THE REGISTER VOTERS IS DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE BILL OF STATISTICS AND SO WE- SO WE HAVE SOME IDEA OF WHO'S DYING AND WAS LIVING- BUT LIKE SO MANY THINGS I MEAN IF YOU. IF YOU HAVE A RELATIVE A FRIEND WHO LIVES OUT OF STATE I MEAN. WHO KNOWS THEY THEY LAUGH I MEAN OTHER THAN. THE PERSON WHO LEFT IN A DILIGENT ABOUT. BUT THEMSELVES BASICALLY LETTING US KNOW THEY MOVE OR THE FAMILY MEMBERS OR WHATEVER SO. I KNOW THERE'S AN EFFORT TO COSTLY DO THAT AND MAKE SURE WAS SCRUBBING THE ROLES AND- AND IT IS AGAINST THE- IT IS ILLEGAL TO VOTE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE SO WE DO HAVE THAT AS AS AN AS AN OPTION. BUT BUT I KNOW THAT THE L. A. IS WORKING ON IT AND IN THE SAME WAY I HEAR STORY. AS YESTERDAY SOMEONE SAID WELL SOMEBODY GOTTA PUTS A BALLOT FOR SOMEONE WHO NO LONGER IS ALIVE. AND THEN I GOT A NOTICE FROM SOMEONE ELSE'S YEAH BUT MY UNCLE DIED AND I GOT A NOTICE IMMEDIATELY FROM THE- SAYING THAT HE HAD BEEN TAKEN OFF THE ROLE SO. WE'VE GOT TO CLEAN IT UP A LITTLE BIT BETTER. OBVIOUSLY AND WITH THAT AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE- WHEN YOU HEAR THE STORIES OF- EVEN IF THEY'RE SMALL YOU KNOW YOU THINK YOU DO THAT YOU DON'T SEVENTY MILLION BOOKS. AND YOU HEAR ONE PERSON TELL YOU THAT A DEAD PERSON VOTED. I MEAN YOU KNOW. BEEN AT SEVENTEEN BE. ALMOST BECOMES INSIGNIFICANT TO PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE WHO ONE WHO THINK THAT THE SYSTEM'S FAULT SO WE HAVE TO. PAY ATTENTION TO IT WE CAN'T IGNORE IT- BUT ALSO- AND I DON'T MISS IT PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE SALE THAT'S ONLY ONE OUT OF SEVENTY MILLION. BUT WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT AT ONE. THAT WAS THE YEAR. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME RIGHT NOW PRETTY SHAPE THAT AND AGAIN I DON'T KNOW HOW SYSTEMIC IT IS I THINK IT'S PROBABLY MORE PRONOUNCED IN L. A. COUNTY- AUGUST KRANTI MY PIE WHY'D THEY WERE SUED. AND SUED SUCCESSFULLY- SO. NOTHING THING I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THINK THERE'S- WILL COME- IT MIGHT. SO THERE'S- TALKING. THAT I'D BE. IN SO- BECAUSE I WANT TALK ABOUT THE THIRTY. MILLION IN. SOURCE CONTRACT FOR VOTER EDUCATION. SO WHEN APPROPRIATE I WOULD LIKE TO. GET ALL. WORK PRODUCT RELATED TO THE CONTRACT. I AM INTERESTED IN INVOICES MEMOS AND DIRECTIONS GIVEN ON DIGITAL ADVERTISING AND DIRECT MAIL TARGETING. AND THE REASON WHY I WANT THAT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU IS I WENT BACK AND LOOKED AFTER THE ELECTION AND THAT PARTICULAR FIRM ALSO WAS ENGAGE IN FIVE CAMPAIGNS AND THE FIVE CAMPING OUT OF ALL THE CAMPAIGNS IN CALIFORNIA. FOUR OF THEM WERE TARGETED CONGRESSIONAL SEATS AND ONE WAS A TARGETED SENATE C. SO I'M PRAYING THAT WE WERE NOT LEVERAGING TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO ASSIST- SINCE GET KANSEN THAT'S NOT ON YOU BUT I WOULD YOU I JUST LIKE TO SEE THAT. BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO HAVE. YOU KNOW SOME COMFORT THAT IN FACT THAT DID NOT OCCUR. BUT INSTEAD IS A BET MAKE THAT REQUEST TO MY OFFICE I'LL BE DOING WRITING YEAH ABSOLUTELY I DON'T REMEMBER FROM SITTING HERE I KNOW I TOTALLY GET IT. SO SO YOU DO THAT YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CONTRACT SO I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE HAS EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY. TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS TO SECRETARY STATE FOR ANY PROGRAM WITHIN THE SECRETARY'S AUTHORITY. DO WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO. DO WE HAVE AUTHORITY TO DO IT YES OKAY THROUGH OUR BUDGET PROCESS YES OKAY DO YOU BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE HAS EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC AMOUNT TO BE APPROPRIATED FOR THAT PROGRAM. AND THAT YOU WILL HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO SIMPLY CHOOSE THE AMOUNT YOU THINK IS APPROPRIATE TO SPEND. SO ONCE WE'VE AFTER WE'VE AUTHORIZED IT DO YOU HAVE TO STAY WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THAT ANDREAS A WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE APPLICATION SURE RIGHT. YOU BELIEVE- THE JOB OF THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S TO CONFIRM THAT BEFORE ANY PAYMENT IS MADE FROM THE STATE GENERAL FUND THAT THERE MUST BE A VALID APPROPRIATION APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE. I ASSUME THE SECOND THE CONTROLLER WILL YES OKAY THE RESPECTED PENA THE CONTROLLER IN THAT REGARD. IT'S RESPECT WHAT. DO YOU RESPECT THE OPINION OF THE CONTROLLER IN THAT REGARD IN TERMS OF IT THE EXPENDITURES. IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LEGISLATURE TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES RIGHT AND IT'S A RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTROLLER TO DISBURSE THOSE RESOURCES BASED UPON THE- THE LEGISLATION WITH REGARDS TO WHAT THE COMMITTEES THE BUDGET COMMITTEE PRESENTS- DO THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO THEN DECIDE THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE- I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T HAVE AN OPINION ABOUT IT I THINK YOUR ANSWER WAS YES WHICH IS WHAT I'M OKAY OR SEMI PRO RIGHT THAT'S GOOD. SO IF THE CONTROLLER SAYS IT THERE'S NO ABOUT APPROPRIATION FOR PROGRAMS TO U. S. SECRETARY WOULD LIKE TO INSTITUTE WOULD YOU BUY BY HER DECISION. AGAIN IT'S- BOB IF NOT OUTRIGHT BY ME DOING WHAT I KNOW ABOUT ALL OF THIS BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP REMINDING YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING THIS TORRENT GREAT I'M JUST GOING THROUGH I'M JUST I'M JUST TRYING TO FGURE OUT WHERE WE'RE GOING- I'M JUST GOING TO WORK ON GETTING YOU OUR RECORD THAT YEAR I HAD THAT I GATHER THAT I GATHER THAT IS AUTHORIZED BY THE LEGISLATURE I GET I GATHER THAT AND YOU KNOW YOU SAID YES ENOUGH TIMES TO BE THAT I'M SAYS I AM SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER BUT OKAY SOUNDS GOOD WE'RE NOW WE'RE WE'RE GOOD. SO AGAIN HE TOOK A CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT AND AGED AGAIN EVERY TIME I HEAR YOUR STORY BECAUSE IT'S AN INCREDIBLE STORY I- I ALWAYS ENJOY IT AND- I'M SURE YOU WILL BE IN A VERY EFFECTIVE SECRETARY. ST THE- YOUR APPROVAL THANKS. AWARENESS THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIRMAN I THIS MAJORITY LEADER. THANK YOU FOR MUCH JIM MANAGE MEDICAL TERM. YOU KNOW I IN BY YOU'RE DIZZY FOR OFFER I THINK HAS ITS- PASTA.

IT IS SO MANY OTHER ELEMENTS AND JUST AS WE TALKED ABOUT I WAS A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT I CARE DEEPLY IS JOINT AUTHOR OF FOUR FIFTY ON THE VOTE CENTER.

RIGHT JUST SHARE TERMS- WHETHER. THE SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY INTUITIVE WE- BUSINESS LEGISLATURE AND- APPROPRIATED MONEY SOME YEARS AGO TO UPDATE CAL ACCESS. WHICH IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE IT MORE INTUITIVE- THERE'S BEEN MANY MILLIONS AND MILLIONS SPENT. AND I AND I MARRY THAT WITH THE ISSUE THAT WAS MENTIONED ABOUT BUSINESS. YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS FOUR POINT ONE SMALL BUSINESSES A TWO THIRDS OF ALL JOBS IN CALIFORNIA COME FROM SMALL BUSINESSES NINETY NINE POINT EIGHT PERCENT. OF ALL BUSINESSES SMALL BUSINESSES AND THOSE INTERFACE WITH YOUR OFFICE. AND WHETHER THERE LLCS ARE ELLO PEAS OR SMOKES S. TOPSHOP DRESS CORPORATIONS OR WHATEVER THEY ARE. I JUST MARRY THAT WITH THE SAME NOTION ABOUT THE INTUITIVE SENSE OF THE POLITICAL SIDE OF CAL ACCESS. WITH THE POLITICAL SIDE WITH THE BUSINESS SIDE TO MAKE. EVERY DAY YOU KNOW MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE TO FOLKS WHO GOVERNMENT'S INTIMIDATING THE PEOPLE IT SCARED TO GO ON THESE THINGS IS SOMETIMES OF ALL THESE FORMS AND ALL THE STUFF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO. ALL I SUGGEST IS AS YOU. WE UNDERSTAND THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE IS. CARE DEEPLY ABOUT ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION JUST IN EVERY RESPECT BECAUSE YOU'RE SO MUCH. INTERFACING WITH THE PUBLIC NOT JUST IN THE ELECTION SIDE BUT BUSINESS SIDE HE JUST MAKE IT IS EASILY ACCESSIBLE ISN'T TO THEIR FEARS FOR FOLKS AS POSSIBLE. YOU KNOW I REMEMBER SOME YEARS AGO AND WE DID- CAL WORKS THE APPLICATION WAS FORTY THREE PAGES AND WE GOT A HUNDRED FIFTY.

ENDORSE THE- THE ISSUE ABOUT ARCHIVE SAYS A CALIFORNIA STORY AND SOMEONE WHO WENT TO A MODERN NEVER MADE IT THROUGH LIKE YOU DID.

AS WE CONTINUE OUR QUEST FOR EQUALITY AND EMPOWERMENT. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE DEADLY RIOT AT THE UNITED STATES. AT ALL ON JANUARY SIXTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. EXTEND ON FALSE ALLEGATIONS OF VOTING IRREGULARITIES ACROSS THE NATION. GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM'S APPOINTMENT OF DR WEBER COMES AT A CRITICAL TIME IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. CALIFORNIA NEEDS SOMEONE WITH DR WEBBER DEDICATION TO SOCIAL JUSTICE AND COMMITMENT. TO PROMOTING AND PRESERVING DEMOCRACY. SHE WILL ENSURE THAT ALL CITIZENS ARE ABLE TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE. AND WITH HER EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND IN EDUCATION AND CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCACY WILL PROMOTE INITIATIVES ON BETTER EDUCATION AND ELECTION PROTECTION. WE SALUTE DR WEBER'S LEADERSHIP AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE AS THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. AND PROFESSOR EMERITA AFRICAN EXPEDIA'S I SEE ANY OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY. SHE ALSO FOUNDED THE BLACK WOMEN'S INITIATIVE OF DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT I'M SORRY WHICH TRAINS WOMEN HOW TO RUN FOR PUBLIC OFFICE AND ADVOCATES. DIEM PORTENTS ABILITY. CABLE RECOGNIZED DR WEBER OUTSTANDING ACCOMPLISHMENTS BY HONORING HER WITH THE LEGISLATOR OF THE YEAR AWARD. AT OUR ANNUAL LEGISLATIVE. DAY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN.

AND THERE IS NO ONE SHOWING UP IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU MR MODERATOR TOM OKAY. WE WILL NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS COLLEAGUES ANYTHING FURTHER. MOTION FROM THE MAJORITY LEADER THANK YOU- IDEA I DIDN'T HAVE QUESTIONS- BUT I DID WANT TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS. YOU KNOW WHAT IT INCREDIBLE HONOR IT IS TO- HAVE YOU BEFORE US TODAY DR WEBER. YOU KNOW WHEN I- MOVED TO SAN DIEGO I WAS TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD. AND I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE FUTURE WOULD HOLD I MET DR WEBER WHEN I WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD. WHEN SHE WAS TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD- SHIRLEY WEBER WAS ALREADY HELPING STUDENTS WITH THEIR FUTURES. AS A PROFESSOR AT SAN DIEGO STATE AND- I SAW HER OUR PATHS CROSSED WHEN SHE SPOKE AS A PRESIDENT OF THE SCHOOL BOARD. AT A LOCAL OUR LUNCHEON IN SUPPORT OF YOUNG WOMEN PARTICIPATING IN OUR COMMUNITY. I HAVE BEEN CONTINUALLY IMPRESSED BY DR WEBER'S COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION. AND TO SO MANY OTHER ISSUES AFFECTING OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR CITY WHERE WE CAME TO KNOW EACH OTHER OF SAN DIEGO AND OF COURSE IN THE LARGER SOCIETY. SO DR WEBER'S DETERMINATION WAS ON MY MIND WHEN I BECAME SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY. I BELIEVE THE ANNUAL STATE BUDGET IS OUR MOST IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY AS A LEGISLATORS. SO I SPEAKER I NEEDED SOMEONE SPECIAL. TO TAKE ON THE ENORMOUS JOB OF BUDGET CHAIR A BUDGET CHAIR WHO COULD HELP CALIFORNIANS RECOVER FROM THE GREAT RECESSION. AND HE WOULD CONTINUE THE PATH OF RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP IN TERMS OF BUILDING RESERVES. AT THE TIME DR WEBER HAD SAID THE BUDGET IS A MORAL DOCUMENT. IT'S A STATEMENT OF OUR VALUES AND WHERE WE INVEST OUR RESOURCES REFLECTS WHAT WE VALUE AS A SOCIETY. AND WHAT OUTCOMES WE EXPECT IN THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. HER STRONG SENSE OF MORALITY AND PUBLIC SERVICES ONLY ONE REASON DR WEBBER WAS THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THIS JOB. AND SPEAKING OF COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE AS SHE DID AND HER COMMENTS. THAT SHE WAS ALSO THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THE JOB WHEN MY SUCCESSOR AS SPEAKER SPEAKER RENDON. PAINTER TO CHEER THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS COMMITTEE WHERE SHE FOCUSED HER LEADERSHIP ON MANY OF THE KEY ISSUES OVERSEEN. BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE. TWO YEARS AGO AT THE END OF SESSION WE FACED A REAL DILEMMA. WORKING WITH DOCTOR WEBER AND SENATOR BRADFORD AND OTHERS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET HER LANDMARK VITALLY IMPORTANT POLICE REFORM BILL AB NINE THIRTY ONE OVER SOME BIG HURDLES. BUT WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR THAT WOULD NOT BE THE VOTES TO PASS IN OUR HOUSE OR CONCUR IN THE ASSEMBLY. I GAVE DR WEBBER MY WORD. THAT SHE WOULD KEEP WORKING ON THE BILL WE WOULD WORK TOGETHER TO PASS AT THE NEXT SESSION. AND AFTER A YEAR OF DIFFICULT MEETINGS AND PAINSTAKING NEGOTIATIONS WE DID PASS AB THREE NINETY TWO AND WHAT AN INCREDIBLE TRIBUTE. THAT MR LOVELL WAS ON THE PHONE SPEAKING STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS CONFIRMATION. FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. EVERYTHING I LOVE AND RESPECT ABOUT SHIRLEY WEBER WAS ON DISPLAY IN EVERY ONE OF THOSE MEETINGS INCLUDING THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF RECALLS. THE THOROUGHNESS OF HER PREPARATION AND THEIR SHREWDNESS SHE DISPLAYED IN ASSESSING POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS AND HOW THEY WOULD IMPACT THE BILL'S CHANCES OR MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW THEY WOULD IMPACT THE BADLY NEEDED CHANGES THE BILL WOULD BRING ABOUT. OTHERS HAVE NOTED THAT DR WEBER'S APPOINTMENT MAKES HISTORY. I BELIEVE SECRETARY OF STATE SHIRLEY WEBER WILL ALSO DRIVE HISTORY ESPECIALLY IN ENSURING CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP ON VOTING RIGHTS AND VOTER PARTICIPATION. FIFTY YEARS AGO THIS MONTH A YOUNG KID NAMED JERRY BROWN WAS SETTLING INTO HIS NEW OFFICE AS CALIFORNIA SECRETARY OF STATE. BRING UP OUR COPS SAID EARLIER. HE WASN'T TWENTY THREE BUT HE WAS PRETTY CLOSE AND DR SHIRLEY WEBER I SEE A LOT OF THAT SAME INTELLECT AND HUMOR FORTUNATELY FOR ALL OF US NOT A LOT OF LATIN SAYINGS YOU HAVE TO GO TO GOOGLE TO TRANSLATOR UNDERSTAND BUT AGAIN THE ELECT THAT THE INTELLECT AND THE HUMOR. AND DR SHIRLEY WEBER I SEE MORALITY DETERMINATION AND LEADERSHIP AND ALWAYS EMPATHY. N. AND DR SHIRLEY WEBER I SEE CALIFORNIA'S NEXT SECRETARY OF STATE SO DOCTOR WEBER AGAIN IT'S AN HONOR. AND WITH THAT- WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR FROM THE MAJORITY LEADER AND I WOULD URGE A STRONG AYE VOTE. M. SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL. FAITH. NONVOTING HAVE SEEN BATES NOT VOTING HERTZBERG BY.

VERY VERY VERY HIGH- ANY I'M I'M AWARE OF THE NEED TO HONOR ROLLS ON THE- OF APPOINTED OFFICE- AN EXAMPLE THAT COMES TO MIND IS THAT I DID SERVE ON THE UC BOARD OF REGENTS FOR TWO YEARS AS A STUDENT REGION- AND WAS ABLE TO MEET MY DUTIES AS A BOARD MEMBER WHILE AT THE SAME TIME. HONORING THAT THE NEEDS OF MY CONSTITUENCY AND I THINK IF YOU ASK ANYONE THAT SERVED ON THE ON THAT BOARD- THEY HAVE A VERY HIGH RESPECT AND ESTEEM FOR MY ABILITY TO DO JUST THAT- THAT WAS NEARLY TEN YEARS AGO I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT I'VE I'VE LEARNED A LOT- THEY GROWN AS. A LEADER- IN THAT. SPAN OF TIME AND SO- I'M GONNA ON ON MY- EXPERIENCE OF THE BILL MY DUTIES IN THIS YEAR ALL. RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MAYOR TEM. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIRMAN. MR MAJORITY LEADER LET ME ASK YOU TO GO NEXT. THANK YOU BOTH FOR. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO SPEND WITH ME TO INTERVIEW- I JOIN IN THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE SO FAR WITH RESPECT TO YOUR RESPECTIVE REDENTIALS AND I THANK YOU. FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE I THINK THIS IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BOARD I WAS AROUND IN THE DAYS WHEN THIS WAS CREATED AS I MENTIONED TO BOTH OF YOU. AND THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT DOING I WANT TO SHARE THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO ON THE RECORD. IS THAT WE IN THE GOVERNMENT- THOSE OF US WHO WERE SITTING HERE- LIKED IT WERE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. BUT TO THE PUBLIC IN A WAY THROUGH AN ELECTION THE GOVERNOR YOU'RE APPOINTING OFFICERS THE SAME. IN ORDER TO MANAGE GOVERNMENT WE DELEGATE AUTHORITY. TO RESPONSIBLE AND THOUGHTFUL BUCS FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY TO HELP US IN THAT REGARD TO LITIGATE CASES IN THE LIKE. AND I JUST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO IS WE ACCESSIBLE IN THIS AS WORKABLE AS POSSIBLE NEVER TAKE AWAY ANYBODY'S ENTHUSIASM BUT ALWAYS JUST. PHAM UNDERSTAND THAT IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT SIDE THEY ARE ON- SHE SAYS TO EVERYONE WHO INTERFACES US WITH US. IN THE PUBLIC IS SO IMPORTANT AND SO AS- I'M HOPEFUL THAT YOU BOTH WILL BE CONFIRMED I THINK THAT YOUR GREAT APPOINTEES AND CONGRATULATE THE GOVERNOR FOR DOING SO AND YOU FOR. TAKING ON THIS RESPONSIBILITY BUT JUST TO NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET THAT AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY AND HOW EVERYONE LOOKS AT YOU BECAUSE OF THE AUTHORITY THAT YOU HOLD BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHETHER YOU'RE FOR THEM OR AGAINST THEM BUT TO ALWAYS TREAT THEM WITH GRACIOUSNESS KINDNESS AND RESPECT. IF YOU EXERCISE THE POWER OF GOVERNMENT THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MR MAJORITY LEADER NOW YOU KNOW WHY HE'S THE MAJORITY LEADER. I THANK YOU FOR THAT- SENATOR LAYERED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET ME THANK EACH OF YOU FOR MEETING WITH ME AS WELL AND I ALSO KNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT. BOTH OF YOU GOT A POINTED RIGHT AT THE OUTBREAK OF THE PANDEMIC AND I'VE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO DO. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO. R. AS BOARD MEMBERS BECAUSE OF THE LIMITATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED. HAVE A QUESTION FOR EACH OF YOU AND LET ME START WITH MISS I SAID. AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE IN OUR- CONVERSATION. AND I MENTIONED AS THE MAJORITY LEADER DID IT'S- I WORKED RIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE FROM THE CONGRESSIONAL STAFF OF JURY WALDIE. WHO THEN WAS APPOINTED TO THE HEY ALL L. R. B. BY JERRY BROWN SHORTLY AFTER THE BOARD WAS CREATED. AND IT WAS EXPLOSIVE IN THAT ERA. THERE WAS LOTS OF DIVISION THAN YESTERDAY WHEN WE WERE TALKING YOU MENTIONED. THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE HISTORY IN SOME WAYS AND I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO TALK ABOUT THAT PROGRESSION WHY YOU SEE. THE BOARD FUNCTIONING WELL AND PEOPLE GETTING ALONG THE STAKES WERE TRICKS PERIODS IS WITH THAT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER LAYERED I THINK. I THINK I AM ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THAT THERE HAS BEEN SUCH A COLLEGIALITY AS YOU KNOW AS BOARD MEMBERS WE WILL EACH HAVE OUR WN OPINIONS I THINK WE HAVE I HAVE TRIED AND I KNOW THE OTHER BOARD MEMBERS HAVE ALSO WORKED. TO INSTILL A CULTURE OF CIVILITY AND COLLEGIALITY AT THE BOARD SO IT LEAST INTERNALLY WE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT- AS BOARD MEMBERS YOU KNOW IT CERTAINLY. AND PASSAGE OF THE L. R. A. I KNOW IT WAS A VERY FIERCE BATTLE TO GET THIS ACT PASSED IN CREATED TO CREATE THE BOARD. AND THAT SOME OF THOSE TENSIONS YOU KNOW HAD PRECEDED THE CREATION OF THE BOARD FOR OVER A DECADE AND I THINK CONTINUED ON. AND WHILE I DO THINK THERE ARE STILL SOME OF THAT THAT STRIFE I THINK OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE DEVELOPED A WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS. TO ASSURE ASSURE EVERYONE THAT WE ARE- ACTING AS JUDICIAL APPROPRIATELY IS JUDICIAL OFFICERS WITHOUT BIAS BUT JUST FURTHERING OUR DUTIES AND THAT'S A GOLD A TENER BUT I HOPE TO CARRY FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER AND LET ME THEN GO TO. TO MISS FLORES BECAUSE I WAS ORIGINALLY GOING TO ASK. A VERSION OF THE QUESTION THAT- OF SENATOR WELCOME PASSED. BUT LET ME ASK YOU GIVEN THE ANSWER THAT YOU JUST HEARD FROM THE CHAIR. HOW DO YOU PLACE YOURSELF IN THAT COLLEGIALITY AND SORT OF THE ABILITY TO WORK AND LOOK AT THOSE. INTERESTS AND WHAT YOUR DUTIES WOULD BE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I SEE MYSELF AS A BOARD MEMBER AS PART OF A TEAM- I RECOGNIZE THAT I HAVE A SINGLE VOTE- AND I WORK ON TO I BRING A PERSPECTIVE OF BACKGROUND EXPERIENCE THAT INFORMS OUR COLLECTIVE WORK- I DO HAVE GREAT RESPECT AND ESTEEM FOR CHAIR HIS FEET- I'VE WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER A FEW MONTHS WELL. ALMOST SIX EIGHT MONTHS NOW- AND I IS INCREDIBLY GIFTED- AND I THINK OF MYSELF AS A BOARD MEMBER- IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO BE A TEAM PLAYER BUT ALSO TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE VISION- AND WHERE SHE'S DRIVING OUR OUR ORGANS ARE AGENCY- AND- I THINK SHE'S INCREDIBLY. WELL EQUIPPED TO DO SO. IN SO GENERAL WHEN YOU RESPONDED TO SENATOR WILL YOU LOOK YEARS AS YOURSELF AS QUASI JUDICIAL AND THEREFORE IT IS NOT AN ADVOCATE A 100% OF THE TIME AND YOU'RE PARTICIPATING IN A VERY COOLEY COOPERATION OUT BOB. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU BRING TO THIS APPOINTMENT. SAID CORRECT.

WHEN WE DID THAT IT WAS AN AGENCY THAT WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH AN AGENCY THAT HAD TROUBLE ADMINISTRATIVELY IT WAS AN AGENCY THAT HAD TROUBLE BALANCING INTERESTS BETWEEN THE SIDES. AND HE WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN FIXING THE ADMINISTRATION BALANCING IT VERY WELL AND WE EVEN DID A MEASURE OF REFORM THAT HE WAS INVOLVED IN THAT WENT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. AND ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS TODAY IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TAKEN A POSITION ON THIS NOMINATION. THERE SOME PEOPLE FROM THE INDUSTRY THAT HE WORKED WITH IN THE MINING AND GEOLOGY BOARD WHERE NORMALLY YOU WOULD THINK HE'S ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY HAVE ENDORSED- OF DISAPPOINTMENT.
