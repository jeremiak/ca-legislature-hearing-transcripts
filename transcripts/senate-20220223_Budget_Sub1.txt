GOOD MORNING SENATORS JACK'S WELL ON FINANCE- THANKS FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS- UC HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW'S BUDGET WITH YOU THIS MORNING. YOU SEE SINGS IS AFFILIATED WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. WHAT IS GOVERNED BY ITS OWN BOARD OF DIRECTORS LOCATED IN SAN FRANCISCO IT PRIMARILY SERVES STUDENTS SEEKING INTEREST OFFERED FREE BUT ALSO AS A MASTER OF LOS PROGRAM IN A MASTER'S OF STUDIES BOND PROGRAM GENERAL NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS. AND ANNUAL TUITION FOR ITS JURIS DOCTOR PROGRAM THIS YEAR'S FORTY SIX THOUSAND THIRTY THREE DOLLARS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES TWO MILLION DOLLAR ONGOING GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATIONS SUPPORT OPERATIONS BRING HASTINGS TOTAL GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO TWENTY ONE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE OHIO. MORNING COMMITTEE JASON CONCENTRA CELIYO. A FEW WEEKS AGO YOU HEARD US RAISE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED AUGMENTATIONS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. WE DON'T SHARE THOSE SAME CONCERNS- FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED AUGMENTATION FOR HASTINGS THERE'S A FEW REASONS FOR THAT. MOST FUNDAMENTALLY- UNLIKE UC HASTINGS HAS PROVIDED THE LEGISLATURE WITH AN EXPENDITURE PLAN ASSOCIATED WITH THE AUGMENTATION. YOU CAN SEE THAT EXPENDITURE PLAN ON PAGE FIVE OF YOUR AGENDA AND NOT AYE TABLE. YOU'LL SEE THE TABLE TOTALS A LITTLE UNDER FOUR AND A HALF MILLION THAT'S LARGER THAN THE PROPOSED TO MOLD MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION. THAT'S BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO RECEIVING A GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION THE SCHOOL ALSO PLANS TO INCREASE- STUDENT TUITION LEVELS GENERATING ADDITIONAL REVENUE FOR MORE EXPENDITURES. I NEED YOU SHOULD BE GETTING THIS- BUDGET YOUR PLAN HE SINGS ALSO PROVIDES A LEGISLATURE WITH AN INITIAL MULTI YEAR PLAN GIVING SOME SENSE AS TO WHERE IT'S HEADING OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. OTHERS LONG TERM PLANIS NOT A MULTI YEAR CONTACT- AND SO THE LEGISLATURE ISN'T BEING ASKED TO COMMIT TO ANY SORT OF MULTI YEAR AGREEMENT UNDER THIS PROPOSAL. I'M GIVEN THESE FACTORS WE THINK THIS PROPOSAL IS A REASONABLE STARTING POINT- THAT'S SAID THIS IS A STARTING POINT SO WE DO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REVIEW THE BUDGET PLAN BEFORE IT. ENSURE THAT IT ALIGNS WITH LEGISLATIVE PROBLEM. ONE FINAL POINT I WANT TO RAISE- THE SCHOOL IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING INITIATIVE TO CHANGE ITS NAME. AND THE SCHOOL INDICATED TO OUR OFFICE THAT THAT NAME CHANGE COULD COME WITH SOME ADDITIONAL ONE TIME COSTS ARE FOR EXAMPLE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING OUR BUILDING SCIENCE THOSE COSTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE SCHOOLS BUDGET YOUR PLAN SO THAT'S SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE I WANT TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR. EITHER A REVISION OR IN THE FUTURE BUDGET. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- MISTER CHANCELLOR- THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING SANDERS- IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU THIS MORNING- THE CAMPUS IS A VERY STRONG AND GROWING IN A SUBSTANTIAL WAY IS- REGARDING AN EXTRAORDINARY CLASS THIS PAST FALL I WAS STRONG METRICS AND DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS ARE ENTERING CLASS WITH AROUND FOUR HUNDRED I WOULD HAVE IDENTIFYING AS STUDENTS OF COLOR- AND 56% ARE WOMEN.

I AND WITH THAT I WILL TURN THE MICROPHONE OVER TO MY YEAH OKAY. BUT STILL IT. MISTER SORT WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY SENATOR- THIS FALL UP ON MONDAY VAGUE UNAIRED WE ARE PROCEEDING ALL CYLINDERS GO TO CREATE A BILL. IT HINGES ON PART WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND- IT LEADS THEM TO OUR- EFFORTS TO EXPAND THAT CONCEPT. BY SPEAKING FLOOD SB ONE SIXTY NINE MONIES FOR THE RENOVATION OF AN EXISTING STUDENT HOUSING ASSET. THAT ABSENCES RENOVATION WOULD NEED TO BE A VACATED IS OUR OUR PROPERTY AT ONE NINETY EIGHT CALIFORNIA. I ONE HUNDRED MCALISTER'S MADE IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE HIGH RISE- BUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES PROVIDE US WITH THE RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN CORE OPERATIONS WE APPRECIATE OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION. AND THE OTHER NOTEWORTHY ELEMENT THIS YEAR IT'LL BE. OUR FIRST YEAR OF A MODEST FEE INCREASE OF THREE PERCENT- THE FIRST INCREASE IN TEN YEARS A THIRD OF WHICH WE DEDICATED TO FINANCIAL AID. AND WITH THAT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND BEFORE I ASK MY FIRST QUESTION LET ME SAY THAT. THE REASON WE HAVE A COMMITTEE MEMBER ABSENT TODAY'S HE'S TAKING THE BAR SO WE'RE HOPING FOR A 100% THE SUBCOMMITTEE PASS RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO. COMPETE WITH YOURS- LET ME ASK A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND ONE EITHER. TO THE DINNER OR MR SEWARD. IT WAS UNCLEAR FROM OUR AGENDA ITEMS WHAT THE TIMING WAS ON THE NAME CHANGE IS THAT. GOING TO BE RECOMMENDED BEFORE THE MAY REVISE IT BEFORE WE- WOULD HAVE TO CONSIDER A LITTLE BIT TO ACCOMMODATE WHATEVER THE COSTS ARE OF THE NAME CHANGE. WE ARE WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIANG AND WE'RE WORKING WITH SENATOR WIENER- THERE'S A SPOT BILL THAT WAS INTRODUCED IT AB NIGHT AB NINETEEN THIRTY SIX. AS A PLACE HOLDER- NEXT WEEK- I'LL BE IN SACRAMENTO FOR A MEETING WITH THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS CHAIRED BY- CENTER ARE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS- WE ANTICIPATE THAT SOME TIME- HOPEFULLY SHORTLY AFTER THAT- THE- LANGUAGE WILL BE INTRODUCED- AND- RIGHT WOULD TAKE OFF JUST CUT TOO SHORT JUST BY SAYING. WE KNOW INTIMATELY HOW SLOW BILLS MOVE SO. THAT THAT ONE WOULD NOT BE ENACTED OR SIGNED UP ON THAT TO GO INTO EFFECT JANUARY FIRST AND SO WE WOULD JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT TO DO BUT IT I'M NOT SURE WILL KNOW BUT MAY REVISE IS WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY. THAN EVER AND I'M NOT SURE WHO TO ASK THIS QUESTION BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANYBODY FROM. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ON BUT- WHEN THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR DID THE- ALLOCATION FOR HOUSING. THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT FOR USE CSU CAN COLLEGES DOES. THE HOUSE. SKEWS ME THE HOUSING PROJECT AT HASTINGS FALL UNDER THE UC'S ALLOCATION FOR HOUSING. WE'VE GOT TO DO. THE ANSWER IS SANDERS YES THE LEGISLATION- THATAUTHORIZED THE ACT OF PROVIDES FOR ALLOCATION FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AND HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW SO WE ARE PART IN PARCEL- INCLUDED IN THE OF THE SENATE SIDE OR UC- AND HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW DOES NOT SPECIFY HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE TO BE DISTRIBUTED THAT THE LEGISLATURE WHAT IT REALLY MEANS IS THEN AS YOU'RE SUBJECT TO THE INTERNAL UC PRIORITIZATION. IS THAT RIGHT NO THAT'S NOT CORRECT- WE ARE SEPARATE BUDGET BACK LINE ITEMS A WEEK COOPERATE VERY CLOSELY WITH THE NUMBERS TO CALIFORNIA WHAT WE DO NOT ACCORDING EIGHT PERCENT. OF WHAT WE HAVE. I THINK MAYBE MY QUESTION WAS MISUNDERSTOOD BECAUSE I ASKED THE FIRST QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU ARE INCLUDED IN THE UC ALLOCATION AND THE ANSWER WAS YES. WAS THAT NOT YES. WHAT DO I LIKE THAT I THINK YOU SEE IS INCLUDED IN THE A. L. SO THIS. I THINK THAT'S THE REASON THIS IS NOT ON THIS HEARING SO THAT THEY DIDN'T HEAR. A. COMMENT SOMEBODY JUST. WHERE IF I MADE A JACKSON BERMAN FOR- I MEAN SEVENTY BASED PROCESS AND I USED THINGS MAY APPLY FOR. FROM THAT POOL IS. IN UC'S. OUT OF BY- IF YOU. WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE SOME THREE CELL AND I'M STAY FOR TEN AND THE BE ABLE PROVIDE INFORMATION. HERE WE GO. THANK YOU CENTER LAYERED- FORGIVEN MEDIA JUST- IF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DOES NOT REVIEW THE YOU HACE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS UNDER DE UM LAW FOR THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT FUND UC HASTINGS AS PART OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 20% BUT IT IS UP TO THE LEGISLATURE TO CHOOSE WHICH PROJECTS FROM THOSE THAT APPLIED WILL BE FUNDED. MMHM. R. N. WHAT WOULD BE DROPPED DOWN ON THAT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WITH REGARD TO THE UC HASTINGS PROJECT. WHAT IT MEANS SIR IS THAT- THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE FOR BOTH UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PROJECTS INK UC HASTINGS- UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS PUT FORWARD SIX HUNDRED MILLION IN APPLICATIONS AND UC HASTINGS HAS THEIR OWN APPLICATIONS SO WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT- WITH THE EXISTING AMOUNT OF FUNDING. YOU CANNOT FUND ALL PROJECTS SO YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THOSE VARIOUS PROJECTS. I'M SORRY I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND IF. WHERE DOES UC HASTINGS STAND IN THAT. CURRENTLY THE ADMINISTRATION IS MAKING ITS RECOMMENDATIONS TO BE TENDERED TO THE LEGISLATURE MARCH FIRST- WE WERE WAITING- INSIGHTS AS TO HOW WE FARE THAT THAT THE COMPETITIVE PROCESS. I THINK I WOULD JUST MAKE A STATEMENT GIVEN ALL THIS DISCUSSION THAT. I THINK THIS PROJECT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HASTINGS AND IT HAS BENEFITS THAT ARE BEYOND JUST THE HOUSING IN TERMS OF WHAT IT BRINGS AND SO- I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW YOU SEE DOES ITS INTERNAL SCORING OR- HOWEVER I SAID BUT- I THINK THIS PERSON WOULD LOOK VERY FAVORABLY ON THIS AND WE JUST HOPE THAT IT. COMPETES ARE WELL WITHIN THE- UC SYSTEM BUT IT. I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET ANY FURTHER ON THIS- I THINK THAT'S THE BEST WE CAN DO AND THEN- MAYBE WE ARE ONE LAST QUESTION OF THE HASTINGS REPRESENTATIVES AND THAT IS WITH REGARD TO A TUITION INCREASE FROM WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR PACKET IT'S THE FIRST TIME IT'S BEEN RAISED IN EIGHT OR TEN YEARS- HE IS. ARE THERE ISSUES WITH THIS ARE PEOPLE JUST RELIEVED THAT IT HAS BEEN RAISED IN A NUMBER OF YEARS AND HERE COMES OR- I HAVE TO TAKE THAT SOME OF THEIR EMPLOYEES. HEARD VERY LITTLE OF CONCERN FROM OUR STUDENTS- THEY ARE GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVEN'T REYES TUITION AND TEN YEAR AND WE'RE STILL ABOUT 12215% ABOVE THE TUITION RATE FOR OUR SISTER WAFFLES IN CALIFORNIA. OKAY THANK YOU- THAT COMPLETES MY QUESTION SIR ASSEMBLY ROADSHOW BOGEY OF ANY QUESTIONS. NO QUESTIONS SO OF LET ME JUST THANK THE WITNESSES FOR BEING HERE WE APPRECIATE IT I THINK WE% ARE MENTIONED JUST SOME CONCERNS FOR US BUT OTHERWISE THIS SEEMS- TOGETHER SO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. OUR WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO WHICH IS THE FIRST OF. SOME ISSUES WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY. AND IT'S DIGIT DIGITIZATION OF SIGNIFICANT MATERIALS WE HAVE ON THE PANEL JENNIFER LOUIS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JASON CONSTANT TOURISTS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND GREG LUCAS THE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARIAN ARE OUR WILL TAKE THEM IN THAT ORDER- WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER LOW. MISTER KAREN MEMBER DIRECTLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT THE STATE LIBRARY'S AUGMENTATIONS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ARE A CONTINUATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S EMPHASIS ON ACCESS EQUITY AND INNOVATION. AND A PART OF THAT SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT FOR THE STATE LIBRARY INCLUDES DIGITISATION OF SIGNIFICANT MATERIALS FOR A TOTAL OF FOURTEEN MILLION OF WHICH TWELVE POINT SEVEN MILLION AND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND AND ONE POINT THREE FOUR MILLION IN ONGOING JOURNAL FINE. WITH THE ACTUAL COMPLETE WITH MY PRESENTATION I'D BE HAPPY TO GO INTO FURTHER DETAIL AS A REQUEST- WE HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A WOMAN BOND. TO THE OHIO. SO IN OUR VIEW THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU THE DIGITIZATION PROPOSAL- IS REASONABLE OF THE STATE'S LIBRARIES CORE MISSION IS TO PRESERVE HISTORICAL ASSETS AND DIGITISATION FURTHERS THAT MISSION BY FURTHER PRESERVING THE ASSET AND MAKING IT ACCESSIBLE WATER TRONIC THREE. I'M NOT CERTAIN I WOULD DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO PAGE EIGHT OF YOUR AGENDA WHICH CONTAINS A TABLE PROVIDING A MORE INFORMATION ON THE EXACT ACTIVITIES FUNDED UNDER THE PROPOSAL. YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S A MULTI FACETED PROPOSAL IT COVERS SEVERAL DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES ONE THREE AGENCIES TAKE ON MANY DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES THERE'S ALWAYS A RISK THAT- THEY FACE CERTAIN. UNFORESEEN IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES- SOMETIMES AT SPRINGS DIFFICULTY MEETING THEIR MILESTONES. I'M GIVEN THAT WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU APPROVE THE FUNDING APPROVED THE PROPOSAL- BUT IN ADDITION ADOPTED REPORTING LANGUAGE TO ASSIST LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE NEXT YEAR. THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE- MANY OF THE KEY COMPONENTS WOULD LAST OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD SO WE RECOMMEND TWO REPORTS ONE AROUND THE MIDDLE AND ONE TOWARDS THE END. JUST ASSIST WITH LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE STATE LIBRARIAN WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SENATOR GREG LUCAS CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY- I DON'T I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD A I THINK THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S SUGGESTION ABOUT REPORTING IT THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE HAPPY TO DO. AND I THINK IT'S- IT BE. A BENEFIT- NOT JUST IN KEEPING THE LEGISLATURE APPRISED OF OUR PROGRESS BUT- IT HELPS US GET THERE TO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I HAD TWO QUESTIONS AND YOU JUST ANSWERED ONE SO THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE- LET'S JUST DOES THE COMMITTEE NOTE THERE SEEMS TO BE AGREEMENT ON THE NOTION OF REPORTING AND THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO DEAL WITH THAT. LATER IN THE YEAR. END FOR THE LIBRARY AND MY OTHER QUESTION IS SOMEBODY THAT IS A- FAMILY HISTORIAN THE ONE THING THAT WAS UNCLEAR FROM THE AGENDA MATERIALS IS. HOW WILL THE DIGITIZED ITEMS BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC SO ONCE THEY ARE DIGITIZED HOW WILL THOSE ACT ACTUALLY BE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE. WHAT PRIMARILY THROUGH THE STATE LIBRARY'S CATALOG WHICH I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE- THE SPREADSHEET THAT JASON WAS JUST REFERRING TO ON PAGE EIGHT. I MEAN ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE HAVE TO DO IS GET A CATALOG IN A POSITION WHERE WE AND- HAVE IT. SORT OF TOUCH ALL OF THE ITEMS THAT- BUT OUR- ARE BEING HELD BY THE STATE LIBRARY. OKAY SO I CAN I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION YES BECAUSE BASICALLY IF IT'S DIGITIZED IT'S ADDED TO THE CATALOG AND A GOOD KNOWLEDGE THIS DIGITIZED AND THEN ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC CAN ACCESS YOUR CATALOG COMMITTEE FRIGHT I MEAN THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IS SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU GO TO THE STATE LIBRARY'S WEBSITE AND YOU SEARCH THE WEBSITE- AT THE MOMENT RIGHT YOU MAY FIND THINGS THERE. RIGHT BUT YOU WON'T FIND IN THE CATALOG AND SO PART OF THIS PROCESS IS SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU GO TO THE CATALOG AND LOOK FOR THE STATE LIBRARY'S DATABASE OF. EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND PROCLAMATIONS- YOU YOU MAY NOT FIND THAT RIGHT IN THE CATALOG BUT YOU'LL FIND THAT IN THE SEARCH BUT WEBSITE. SO PART OF IT IS IT'S NOT EXACTLY LIKE YOU KNOW EMERGENCY SERVICES LOOKS AT IT BUT- PART OF IT IS THIS IDEA OF INTER OPERABILITY RIGHT SO IF YOU. I DO. SUPPORT ON THE WEBSITE YOU CAN FIND AT AND IF YOU SEARCH ON THE CATALOG YOU CAN FIND WELL. I WOULD JUST SUGGEST IS A FREQUENT USER OF SUCH THINGS THAT SOMEHOW. IN THE PROCESS A USER NEEDS TO TRIP OVER A STATEMENT THAT SAYS. SOMETHING'S ARMAMENT CATALOG DO A KEYWORD SEARCH AND FIND SOMETHING THAT PUTS THAT OUT THERE AND SUGGESTED FOR THEM SO THAT THEY KNOW. NO BIG DEAL IT'S JUST. THE YOU KNOW. IT YOU AND I HAVE TALKED- I DID A BILL I WAS A DIAZ. OVER THE FACT THAT SOMETHING LIKE 8210% OF WHAT'S HELD IN THE STATE ARCHIVES. WHICH IS NOT UNDER YOUR JURISDICTION. ARE HELD IN THE STATE ARCHIVES WAS WAS CONFIDENTIAL AND CLOSE TO THE PUBLIC AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE. PRISON RECORDS FROM THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS SOME CIVIL WAR PENSIONS MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS. THINGS WERE THE PERSON INVOLVED AND THEIR CHILDREN PROBABLY HAD LONG SINCE DIED IF NOT GRANDCHILDREN AND SODA THE CONCERN FOR CONFIDENTIALITY WAS WIFE. INDEED IT IS THE BILL ALLOWED THE ARCHIVIST OPEN THESE AND SO THEY WERE OPENING- AND DIGITIZING THEM. IN A WAY THAT THEY WERE OUT ON THE WEBSITE YOU COULD KEYWORD SEARCH BY NAME YOU COULD FIND A AND IT WAS A WAY IF YOU WERE DOING RESEARCH ON YOUR FAMILY THAT. THAT YOU CAN GET IT OUT THERE IN IN A WAY THAT PEOPLE COULD ACCESS SO. THAT'S ALL ON. DRUGS IT'S NO BIG DEAL. JUST I WOULD HOPE THAT PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE TO KNOW. CERTAIN THANKS TO GO DEEP INTO A TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO THEM SO JUST. THROUGH THAT FILTER. BUT THIS IS A GREAT PROJECT I STRONGLY SUPPORTED. I'M GLAD THAT YOU AGREED TO THE- REPORTED. A CENTER- TROUBLE. ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ONE. JUST THE PERSON SAYS HERE- TO CELEBRATE HAVING IDEA AND THE TIMELINE FOR ROLLING OUT THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSAL. IT'S SET MY RECOLLECTION I I'LL DOUBLE CHECK FOR YOU BUT MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT IT'S OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD. SO THERE'S IT'S SHEARED RIGHT THERE'S ACTIVITIES THAT BEGAN IN THE FIRST YEAR AND THEN THERE'S ONES THAT SORT OF CARRIED THROUGH FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. SO IT'S ONE TIME MONEY THAT'S PARCELED OUT OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD. OKAY AND- BECAUSE THE LINE WOULD BE STARTING ON JULY FIRST OR JULY SECOND PROBABLY BUT- I MEAN IT'S OVER FOR YOUR- WONDERFUL THANK YOU AND THEN MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION WOULD BE FROM LAST YEAR'S I KNOW THAT- I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THIS MORNING THE ALLOCATION OF THE FUNDS THAT WERE GIVEN TO THE STATE LIBRARY LAST YEAR. WAS IT. TWO BILLION DOLLARS OR WAS IT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. THE FUNDING THAT WENT TO THE STATE IRIS LAST YEAR AND I WANTED TO JUST CAN I GET AN UPDATE AS TO- THE PROGRESS THAT HAD BEEN MADE WITH THAT WITH THOSE FUNDS AND HOW THEY HAVE BEEN UTILIZED THIS PAST YEAR. WELL IF WE IF WE HAD GOTTEN TWO BILLION DOLLARS OR OR ONE BILLION DOLLARS- I WOULD HAVE QUICKLY DECLARED VICTORY AND RETIRED- FIGURE OUT THE AMOUNT THE EXACT AMOUNT AND I WAS TALKING TO MY- CONSULTANT AT THAT DO YOU REMEMBER THE AMOUNT. IT CORRECT ME I. SENATOR NOW WE KNOW THAT THAT IF YOU PUT THAT AMOUNT AND YOU CAN GET HIM TO RETIRE. PROBABLY THE MORE SIGNIFICANT. LEADS US. WHERE TO THAT- SENATORS SO THE BALL OF THE MONEY THAT CAME TO THE STATE LIBRARY LAST YEAR WAS- ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S EARMARKED FOR- KIND OF LIFE SAFETY DIRE NEED IMPROVEMENTS TO LOCAL LIBRARY FACILITIES AROUND STATE. AND THERE'S AT THE END OF OUR SECTION THERE'S- THERE'S A SECTION THAT GOES THROUGH TRYING TO FIND THE PAGE FOR YOU- EIGHT SEVENTEEN ON MY AGENDA IT TALKS ABOUT ALL THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS THAT THE LIBRARY RECEIVED MONEY FOR AND- I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON THOSE I SENT A MEMO AS WELL TOO- COMMITTEE LAST NIGHT THAT KIND OF TOUCHES ON MAN THE NEXT BEST AVAILABLE AS WELL. IS THERE A SPECIFIC ONE- NO I WILL REVIEW SO LET ME JUST FOR THE RECORD COMPLETELY NOT ONE OR TWO BILL BILLION DOLLARS. SO WHAT. I GUESS WE'LL JUST HAVE TO. ARGUE THAT THEY CAN BE GOING HE SAID THIS IS ONE THAT WE WON'T GET AN ANSWER TO YOU OFFLINE OKAY PERFECT WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO OFFER SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO THE COMMITTEE. ALWAYS THE LAST ONE UP AGAINST A DOUBLE- I JUST DID ARE THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT THIS PROGRAM THE DIGITIZATION PROPOSAL OVER HOW MANY YEARS I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IT'S A THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME ELEMENTS THAT ARE OVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD AS REGULATED TO. OTHERS A SMALL COMPONENT THAT'S ONGOING SO THERE ARE SOME ONGOING POSITIONS THAT ARE FUNDED YOU CAN SEE THAT AGAIN ON THE ON THE TABLE ON PAGE EIGHT- THERE ARE SEVERAL ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD HAVE SORT OF PERMANENT POSITION SO THAT WOULD BE ONGOING AND THEN THERE ARE A SOMEONE TIME FUNDS THAT WOULD JUST BE ONE TIME JUST AND THE BUDGET YEAR. SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF DIFFERENT ACTUALLY USE BUT YOU COULD THINK OF THEM. I AM VERY FOCUSED THE- PROPOSAL'S REALLY BEING OVER A FIVE YEAR INITIAL FIVE YEAR PERIOD. AND THEN THERE WAS A QUESTION AS TO HOW MUCH FUNDING THE STATE LIBRARY RECEIVED AND I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT AMOUNT IN FRONT OF ME BUT IT WAS ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- MOTION WHICH WAS ONE TIME FUNDING- THE BIGGEST PROPOSAL WAS FOR LIBRARY INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS. I WAS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION AND THEN THERE THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED OR SOME MILLION FOR OTHER LOCAL INITIATIVES AND ON AN ISSUE SIX YOU'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY GET IMPLEMENTATION UPDATE ON ALL THESE ACTIVITIES TO SEE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE. IN A FEW MUCH YOU'RE SAYING IS SHE HAS ANOTHER BITE AT THE APPLE. PRESS OKAY THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS LOOKING AT THE FIRST PAGE OF THE STATE LIBRARY SECTION HERE IN THE AGENDA- IT SAYS FOR A STATE LIBRARY EXPENDITURES TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE. MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN DOLLARS. SO YES SENATOR NOT A BILLION. AND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX OR A TWO THIRDS OF THE WAY THERE. OKAY WELL THANKS CLARIFY CENTER THAT THAT POOL OF FUNDS- THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY REFERENCES AVAILABLE FOR FIVE YEARS I READ THE BOOK THANK YOU. OKAY WE APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S OUR COMMENTS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE AT THE LIBRARY ONLINE JOB TRAINING AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND INTERESTINGLY IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME PANEL SO WHAT LET'S BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HELLO AGAIN MISTER CHAIR AND A MEMBER JENNIFER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AS THE STATE LIBRARIES- ASIANS FOR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TOTALS TWENTY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION AND WITHIN THAT ONE TIME- OF MEDITATION IS THE ONLINE JOB TRAINING AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WHICH COMPOSES OF EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. WHICH IS A CONTINUATION OF ONLINE UP SKILLING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SERVICES TO LOCAL LIBRARY PATRONS CURRENTLY SUPPORTED BY FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT THAT I SHALL CONCLUDE MY PRESENTATION AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I KNOW I HAVE A QUESTION OF A- L. A. O. WE- WON. A REASONABLE WAY TO VIEW THIS PROPOSAL IS TO TREAT IT AS A PILOT SO CURRENTLY THE STATE LIBRARY. IS SPENDING FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. OF FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS ON- LIBRARY BASE WRKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS- THIS PROPOSAL WOULD EXTEND THAT FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWO YEARS FOR THAT WHAT WHAT USING GENERAL FUND SO THAT WOULD GIVE. THREE YEARS OF ACTIVITY THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD THEN EVALUATE THIS A INITIATIVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE THINGS IS PROMISING IS WORTH PILOTING. AND WE THINK THE KEY CHALLENGE HERE IS THAT BECAUSE THE INITIATIVE IS STILL IN ITS FIRST YEAR OF OPERATION IT'S DIFFICULT TO GAUGE THAT- THE STATE LIBRARY STILL COLLECTING INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF PATRONS WHO ARE PARTICIPATING. PATRON DEMOGRAPHICS UPDATE PARTICIPANT OUTCOMES IN THESE PROGRAMS THAT'S DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS AND THE OVERALL IMPACT. THE STATE LIBRARY DID PROVIDE US ONE HE MEASURE WHICH IS THE NUMBER OF COURSE HOURS- COMPLETED THUS FAR- WHICH THEY ESTIMATE WHICH THEY SAID WAS OVER TWENTY THOUSAND COURSE HOURS- GAUGE. THEY SORT OF IMPACT OF THAT WE CONVERTED THAT USING A SORT OF A FULL TIME EQUIVALENT BASIS IT'S A SIMILAR APPROACH WE USE FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I GOT AN ESTIMATE OF ABOUT FORTY FULL TIME EQUIVALENT PARTICIPANTS. NOW WOULD SUGGEST A AVERAGE COST ABOUT OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER FULL TIME EQUIVALENT PARTICIPATE WHICH IS QUITE A BIT HIGHER THAN WHAT THE STATE PROVIDES TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. NOW HE INITIATIVE STILL ONGOING SO IT'S LIKELY THAT MORE COURSE HOURS WILL BE COMPLETED. BUT AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF SORT OF THE DATA AND SOME OF THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE NUMBER OF COURSE HOURS WE THINK IT'S A BIT PREMATURE TO BE SUPPORTING THIS INITIATIVE AT THIS. TIME WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSAL. ONE OTHER POINT I'D LIKE TO. REJECTED THE PROPOSAL WOULD NOT BE THE FINAL WORD ON IT. FOLLOWING THE STATE LIBRARY CONSOLE THE MINISTER IT'S FEDERAL FUNDING COULD STILL IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM COLLECTED ON IT. THEY WERE TO COLLECT A LOT OF THE DATA THAT ADDRESSES MANY OF OUR CONCERNS. THE STATE LIBRARY COULD RETURN THE LEGISLATURE TO FUTURE YOUR- AND REQUEST FUNDING FOR IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE STATE WEBER. IT'S GREAT WORKERS FROM THE STATE LIBRARY. UP. I GUESS THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT WE REQUESTED THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO CREATE A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE WE COULD BETTER ASSESS THE PROGRAM'S EFFICACY AND HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE USING IT AND OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD BE ABLE TO ON AN ANNUAL OR EVEN A SEMI ANNUAL BASIS FINE TUNE WHAT'S BEING PROVIDED. WHAT WE FOUND SO FAR IN THE REASON WE SUBMITTED THE BUDGET REQUEST IS- THANK THANKS ENERGY MAY BE TOO STRONG A WORD BUT NEW PARTNERSHIPS THAT HAVE- MERCH BETWEEN LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- COMMITTEES AND JOB CENTRES SAY I MEAN THE STORY I ENJOYED COMES FROM ANAHEIM. WHERETHE THEIR JOB SANDERS SAID MY GOD YOU KNOW NOW WE HAVE THESE ALL OF THESE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THE PEOPLE TO COME AND VISIT US WE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD THIS ON OUR OWN. AND THAT'S WHY WE ASK FOR THE ADDITIONAL TWO YEARS IS TO DO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT JASON WAS SUGGESTED IT IS JUST WAS GIVING WAS SUGGESTING WHICH IS TO GET A BETTER DETERMINATION OF HOW IT WORKS. ONE YEAR ISN'T REALLY ENOUGH TO. OKAY DOES THAT COMPLETE YOUR COMMENTS YES SEVEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATED AND I THINK THAT. THAT MY ONE QUESTION WAS GOING TO BEAT S. FOR RESPONSE TO THE L. A. OWES OUR COMMENTS AND I THINK THAT THAT'S JUST WHAT THE STATE LIBRARY DID SO- ARE CONSIDERED AND MAY LET ME ASK CENTER ACCIONES BIOGRAPHY OF ANY QUESTIONS. SO WITH THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF LOCAL COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AND- TRADE SCHOOLS ARE HEADING IN THAT IN THAT. SPACE WITH THE LIBRARY COMING INTO WANTED TO DO SOMETHING THAT ARE ON THAT END ARE YOU FOLKS LOOKING TO COMPLEMENT THE LOCAL PROGRAMS ARE YOU FOLKS LOOKING INTO BEING YOUR OWN PROGRAM. SORRY SENATORS MUTED MYSELF- OUR GOAL IS TO COMPLEMENT AND PARTNER WITH LOCAL PROGRAMS THAT'S WHERE THE GREATEST SUCCESS SO FAR IN THE EARLY MONTHS OF EMPLOYING IMPLEMENTING THIS HAVE COME FROM. AND ADDITIONALLY- OVER THE OVER THE YEAR OF THE PANDEMIC MANY MORE PEOPLE ARE ENTERING LIBRARIES THROUGH THE DIGITAL DOORWAY RIGHT THEN THEN THE PHYSICAL DOORWAY. AND SO AN AREA WHERE THE STATE CAN BE OF HELP IS AN STATEWIDE CONTRACTS OR STATEWIDE SUBSCRIPTIONS LIKE THIS WHERE WE CAN MAKE THINGS AVAILABLE EQUALLY TO ALL LIBRARIES. AND ALLOW OLD PEOPLE WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON- HAVE FALLEN OUT OF THE WORK FORCE BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC THEY CAN ACCESS THESE MATERIALS- FROM THEIR HOME AS WELL AS GOING TO A LOCAL JOBCENTRE LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- COMMITTEE S. AS YOU'RE DESCRIBING. OKAY AND DO YOU HAVE THE STUFF TO BE ABLE TO- PROVIDE THIS PROGRAM THE SERVICES. SORRY I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION IN ORDER TO SO ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE- WITH MANY OF THE- AB SCHOOLS THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM IS THE FACT THAT WE'RE- WE'RE GIVING THEM A LOT OF- MONIES. FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CERTAIN PROGRAMS BUT THAT THE CHALLENGE LIES IN. HAVING THE ACTUAL STAFF DETERMINED THESE PROGRAMS SO MY QUESTION TO YOU WOULD BE. DO YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THESE- THESE PROGRAMS IN IN THESE RESOURCES. YES THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES- I MEAN THIS PROPOSAL DOESN'T COME WITH ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL FOR THE STATE LIBRARY. BUT ONE OF THE TERRIFIC THINGS ABOUT- I MEAN SOME OF THESE. SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE IN THIS PLATFORM OR THIS CAFETERIA RIGHT OF. YOU KNOW JOB JOB SKILLS JOB TRAINING JOB DEVELOPMENT BUT THINGS LIKE LINKED IN LEARNING COURSE THERE THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS WHICH ARE. EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE SO PRIMARILY BY THE. SORT OF A YOU KNOW THE PERSONNEL ASPECT IS AND- HELPING SOMEBODY FIND WHAT IT IS THEY'RE LOOKING FOR IF THEY CAN'T FIND IT THEMSELVES IS PRIMARILY A SELF SERVICE SORT OF. CONCEPT SO THE WINDY WAY OF SAYING YES WE HAVE THE- NOW TO BE ABLE TO PUT THIS OUT TO EVERY LOCAL LIBRARY. THANK YOU THANK YOU THE COMPLETE YOUR QUESTION YES THANK YOU. IT AND LET ME JUST NOTE THAT I KNOW THE STATE LIBRARIAN WORKS OUT OF THE CUBICLES ON JUST TO THIRTIES FOUND THE BACKGROUND. CHECKS HAVE THE STATURE THE- ISSUE. OF LET'S MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR WHICH IS LUNCH AT THE LIBRARY AND FASCINATINGLY WE HAVE THE EXACTLY THE SAME PANEL SO LET'S BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HELLO JENNIFER LOUIS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE STATE LIBRARY'S AUGMENTATION- FOR ON GOING TO FIND TOTAL IS EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND. WHICH WITHIN THE SET AMOUNT TO AT LUNCH AT THE LIBRARY IS PROVIDE FOR FIVE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND AND WITHIN THAT THE AUGMENTATION FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION WILL GO TOWARDS LOCAL SYSTEMS TO SUPPORTING MUCH OF THE LIBRARY. I WITH THAT I. SHALL CONCLUDE MY PRESENTATION I'LL BE HAPPY TO GO INTO ANY FURTHER DETAILS- AS REQUESTED OR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE TO THE LA OF. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES A VERY SALIENT ISSUE WHICH IS A FOOD INSECURITY AMONG CHILDREN. AND IT AIMS TO ADDRESS THAT BY INCREASING PARTICIPATION IN THE FEDERAL SUMMER MEALS PROGRAM. GRAHAM OF PROVIDES A FEDERALLY FUNDED MEALS TO STUDENTS AT VERY STATE SITES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THIS PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY FOCUSES ON- ESTABLISHING MORE LIBRARY SITES THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE FEDERAL SUMMER MEALS PROGRAM OBJECTIVE BUT WE HAVE THREE CONCERNS THE FIRST CONCERN AS A CONCERNED YOU PRODUCE REYES IN PAST YEARS WHICH IS THAT THE PROPOSAL IN QUESTION IS A- FAIRLY NARROW APPROACH TO ADDRESS A SUMMER STUDENT SECURITY. THE PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY FOCUSES ON CREATING MORE LIBRARY SITES EVEN THOUGH MANY KINDS OF SITES CAN QUALIFY TO DELIVER- FEDERAL SUMMER MEALS RAISE IS THAT- SOME OTHER STATE ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN. INCREASING PARTICIPATION IN THE FEDERAL SUMMER MEALS PROGRAM. FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE IS CURRENTLY. IMPLEMENTING THE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM WHERE YOU WALK. WHICH SUPPORTS MORE AFTERSCHOOL AND SUMMER LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AT SCHOOLS BECAUSE STUDENTS WOULD BE ATTENDING- SCHOOLS DURING THE SUMMER- IT FOR PARTS OF THE SUMMER THAT WAY THAT COULD RESULT IN AND I'M MORE PARTICIPATION AND FEDERAL SOMEONE YELLS. EXACT IMPACT OF THAT IS HARD TO. GAUGE AT THIS MOMENT. AND THE THIRD ISSUE WE WANT TO RAISES AND THIS IS A COMMON YOU'LL HEAR IS MAKE FOR A LOT OF THE PROPOSALS- IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE PROPOSAL COMES WITH VERY FEW STATUTORY PARAMETERS ACCORDING LANGUAGE OR AN EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM- GIVEN THESE FACTORS WE HAVE WE RECOMMEND TWO MODIFICATIONS TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. THE FIRST IS WE RECOMMEND NARROWING THE SCOPE OF IT AND MAKING THE PROPOSAL LIMITED TERMS. OF FOR EXAMPLE WE SUGGEST. PERHAPS PROVIDING FIVE MILLION THAT COULD BE SPENT OVER THREE YEARS LEGISLATURE TO BETTER SISTER THE IMPACT OF THE AUGMENTATION TO THE LUNCH OF LIBRARY PROGRAMS. BUT ALSO ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE FEW YEARS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF OTHER ACTIVITIES LIKE YOU WALK AND- ASING SUMMER MEAL PARTICIPATION. OUR M. ALERT ACRONYM ALERT EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES I'M SORRY SENATOR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THEIR- FOR NOW. AND THEN THE SECOND MODIFICATION WE RECOMMEND. WOULD BE TO ADOPT MORE STATUTORY GUIDANCE BECAUSE HOUSING PARAMETERS OVER HOW THE FUNDS TO BE SPENT ASTONISHING REPORTING LANGUAGE- AND REQUIRING EVALUATION OF PROGRAM WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH STAFF ON SOME OF THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS ABOUT IT MORE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE STATE BY BURNT. GREG LUCAS FROM THE STATE LIBRARY- YOU KNOW I. ME PERSONALLY AT THE STATE LIBRARY AND A LOT OF LOCAL LIBRARIANS- ARE ARE VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS PROGRAM AND THANK YOU KNOW. I THINK WHAT IT SAYS FOOD INSECURITY IS A SALIENT ISSUE I MEAN THAT UNDERSTATES IT A LITTLE BIT- THERE'S THREE MILLION KIDS IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR- YOU KNOW FREE OR SUBSIDIZED SCHOOL LUNCHES. AND ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 11% OF THEM ARE GETTING MAIL IN THE SUMMER. AND IF YOU'RE HUNGRY YOU CAN'T ALERT. AND THIS THIS MAY BE I FORGOT WHAT THAT LED CHANNELS THING IS. IS THAT AN INCREMENTAL OR NOT A GLOBAL APPROACH BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEING DONE TO TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS. AND THE INCREASE THAT'S PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET ALSO ALLOWS THE LIBRARY TWO ONE. THE HAVE SOMEBODY DEVOTED TO THIS PROGRAM FULL TIME TO HELP LOCAL LIBRARIES DO THE THINGS THAT MAKE THIS PROGRAM A SUCCESS AND- HELP PROVIDE MEALS AND OTHER FOOD SITES WHICH IS. TO CREATE PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL FOOD BANKS WHICH IS TO CREATE. SYSTEMS WHERE WHEN A SCHOOL DISTRICT CLOSES RIGHT BAY HAND OFF THE BATON TO THE LOCAL LIBRARY OR THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB I MEAN THEY DO A LOT OF SUMMER. MEALS AS WELL THE IDEA HERE IS TO TRY AND IMPROVE THE- INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MEALS THAT ARE BOWING TO HUNGRY KIDS IS THIS THE ANSWER NOW. I MEAN LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE ENDED UP PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED A BILL THAT SAYS. ANY KID WHO'S HUNGRY DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR GETS A MEAL. AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS DEVOTED TO THAT IN THE EDUCATION BUDGET ALONG WITH A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION TO MAKE. KITCHEN IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO ACCOMMODATE THAT SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- FEELS LIKE AN ONGOING. APPROPRIATE OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP FEED MORE THAN RIGHT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THE THREE MILLION KIDS YOU SHOULD BE EATING MEALS DURING THE SUMMER IT ISN'T THAT- THE NORMAL SEVEN INVESTMENT. WITH RESPECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH END UP LET ME JUST MAKE A COMMENT BOB THE FORCE IF THERE'S OTHER QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENT AS I WAS TELLING THE STAFF DURING THE BRIEFING THAT WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND WAS BUDGET CHAIR. R. EVERY YEAR THAT AWAY ALL LEGISLATIVE ANALYST WOULD COME TO US AND SAY WE WANT TO INCREASE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FEES SAID EVERY YEAR I'D SAY NO WHAT WHAT WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT BY. THE WAY- ONE YEAR CAME IN A WITH THE SPEAKER AND I. AND SAID IN A RECOMMENDATION THAT'S GOING TO MAKE JOHN WANT TO THROW UP. ONCE AGAIN WE WANT TO RAISE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FEES IT AND- AND WEBER AND SO I REALLY TRULY APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST IN THEIR ROLE AND EVERY YEAR THEY MAKE A RUN AT THIS PROGRAM AND I THINK. THE FACT THAT IT'S HERE'S JUST A STATEMENT THAT WERE COMMITTED TO IT. AND WE WANT TO KEEP GOING SO I THINK THAT'S JUST WHERE WE ARE IN TOUCH WITH ME S. SENATE WROTE SHOWBOAT. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AND SHE HAS. NO QUESTION SO LET ME THANK EVERYBODY. FOR THEIR CAR ON THAT AND THEN WE'LL MOVE TO ISSUE SIX- WHICH IS LIBRARY BUILDING RENTAL COSTS AND- AND IT'S THE SAME PANEL WILL BEGIN WITH OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HELLO JENNIFER LOUIS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ON GOING ON VACATION TO SUPPORT THE STATE LIBRARY- WERE. PROPOSING INCREASED RENTAL COSTS- FOR THE LIBRARY COURTS BUILDING A QUEUE OF TWO POINT TWO MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT TO THE STATE OPERATIONS FOR THE STATE LIBRARY. WITH THE ACTUAL COMPLETE MY PRESENTATION AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU MOVED TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. NO CONCERNS ON THIS PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND YOU APPROVE THE FUNDS GREAT THANK YOU AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE STATE LIBRARY- THAT'S GREAT- BECAUSE FROM THE STATE LIBRARY THAT. THAT'S YOUR HONOR WHAT I THINK ABOUT IT NO WE'RE HAPPY TO KEEP YOU IN CUBICLES. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WILL MOVE TO A AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY PROBLEMS THERE'S NO QUESTION. ON THIS. ONE ISSUE NUMBER SIX THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BUDGET ACT AGREEMENT THIS IS ONE THAT WE JUMP TO A LITTLE BIT EARLIER. IT'S A OVERSIGHT IN THE ONE PERSON TO SPEAK ON MRS OF THE STATE LIBRARY SO MR WORKERS PROCEED- I SENT A MEMO LAST NIGHT THAT SORT OF SUMMARIZES THE COMMITTEE THAT THE KIND OF pEACH OF THESE PROGRAMS. I CAN GO THROUGH THEM IN THE ORDER THEY ARE LISTED AND BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THAT I THINK. THAT THE MATERIAL IS SELF EXPLANATORY IF YOU COULD JUST GO THROUGH A NAME EACH ONE A DO A SENTENCE OR TWO ABOUT IT THAT'S MAYBE A GOOD WAY TO JUST SUMMARIZE IT AND YEAH. HAPPY TO HAVE QUESTIONS. SENATOR OCHO BOGUE LEFT THE ROOM TEMPORARILY AND- IN A SENTENCE OR TWO ABOUT EACH ONE MIGHT ALLOW HER TO BE BACK IN TIME FOR QUESTIONS. OKAY WELL THE FIRST ONE IS THE LIBRARY INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM- FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE MILLION. WE CONDUCTED- WHAT WE CALL A PRE APPLICATION PROCESS LAST FALL IN SEPTEMBER. THE TRYING TO GAUGE WHAT THE- NEED WAS OUT THERE THE DEMAND- AND SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT HAVEN'T BEEN ANTICIPATED- IN THE BUDGET BILL IN TERMS OF SPENDING WE RECEIVED SEVENTY THREE APPLICATIONS- OF WHICH- SIXTY WERE FOR BUILDINGS THAT ARE- EIGHTY EIGHT AMERICANS WITH. DISABILITIES ACT COMPLIANT AND IS. AN AREA WHERE NEITHER REALLY THE STATE NOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDES FUNDS TO ASSIST LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN MEETING THOSE REQUIREMENTS. AND ACTUALLY THAT WAS THE MAJOR ONE SO WANTED TO JUST- ALLUDE TO THE LIBRARY BROADBAND TO DOUBLE BROADBAND ARE WORKING WITH THE OUTFIT CALLED CTC ENERGY AND TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS A THIRD PARTY AGGREGATORS THE STATE HAS THE STATE LIBRARY HAS ENTITY BUT WORKS WITH US IN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SCENIC WHICH THE STATE HAS NOW CONTRACTED WITH TO DO THIS NEW MIDDLE MILE WORK THAT'S GOING ON AND SO THEY'VE BEEN WORKING WITH US TO TRY AND FIND BEES PROJECTS THAT THE THIS POT OF MONEY IS DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE AND THOSE ARE. PROJECTS IN WHICH- YOU CONNECT AS PART OF ONE PROJECT AT LEAST A SCHOOL AT LEAST A LIBRARY PROVIDE TELEHEALTH AND WHERE WHERE WE CAN- INCLUDED TRIBAL NATION EACH OF THOSE ENTITIES GETS A FEDERAL DISCOUNT. AND SO USING THIS MONEY TO ALSO MAKE A DOWN PAYMENT OR A MATCHES WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CALLS IT. ALLOWS A LOT OF PROJECTS ARE OUR EXPERIENCE IS BANNED. IN PARTNERSHIPS WITH SCHOOLS ON THINGS LIKE THIS IT ALLOWS PROJECTS THAT PREVIOUSLY WEREN'T BEING BID ON THE LAST MILE TO GET MORE INTEREST FROM PEOPLE WANTING TO. COME WANTING TO CONNECT WE'RE NOT AS FAR ALONG ON IT AS WE LIKE TO BE BUT PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WORK- WITHOUT. WANT TO RESEARCH A BUNCH OF DATA ACQUISITION CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DIFFERENT PARTNERS THE STAKEHOLDERS NOW THERE'S INTERACTIONS WITH- THE STATE'S MIDDLE MILE WORK. SO MORTON YOU KNOW THAT'S PERFECT FOR A SO LET ME MOVE TO- TO A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND ONE IS THAT A COMMON QUESTION OF LAST YEAR FOREIGN THIRTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS WAS PUT IN THE LIBRARY INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM WHICH YOU WENT OVER A MINUTE AGO. AND INTERESTING Y. E. WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO THE VOTERS APPROVED A LIBRARY BOND ACT IT WAS FOR FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND SO HERE WE ARE WHEN WE HAVE ONE TIME MNEY PUTTING IN THE BUDGET ONE TIME ALMOST EXACTLY WHAT. THE VOTERS HAD APPROVED YEARS AGO AND WE DID IT WITHOUT ANY INTEREST COSTS THE ONE QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT. OF THE PROJECT STARTS IN THE BUDGET YEAR BUT A PROJECTS SUBJECT TO THIS WAS AVAILABLE FOR ENCUMBRANCE UNTIL THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR DOES THAT MEAN THAT THESE FUNDS ARE FULLY SUBSCRIBED AND IT'S JUST A MATTER OF MAKING SURE THEY'RE DONE BY JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IS ALL THIS MONEY OUT THE DOOR. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- THE MONEY CAN BE PUT OUT THE DOOR OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD AND THE INTENT WAS IT IN OUR EXPERIENCE- AT AT THE LIBRARY. YOU KNOW OFTEN THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD BENEFIT MOST FROM THE GRANT PROGRAM ARE THE ONES WHO ARE LEAST PREPARED OR HAVE THE LEAST RESOURCES. YOU KNOW PUT TOGETHER AN APPLICATION AND SO THE THINKING WAS THAT IF WE HAD THIS MONEY TO BE ABLE TO GIVE IT OUT OVER OVER A TIME PERIOD THAT WE BE ABLE TO CATCH AND HELP MORE MORE OF THAT CATEGORY OF LIBRARY OR AT. NO I. DON'T THINK WHAT I WAS JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS I THINK THE IMPLICATION WAS IS THAT THE PROJECTS NEEDED TO BE SHOVEL READY SO THAT THEY CAN NOW. THEY DON'T THEY DON'T NEED TO BE OBLIGATED THIS YEAR AND DON BY JUNE TWENTY TWENTY YEAH I THINK THE FOUR YEAR TIME FRAME IS FOR US TO GET THE MONEY OUT. OKAY AND THAT IS WHAT I WAS THE- PROJECT. SORRY NO THAT'S OKAY THE- PHONE THAT WAS THE ONE THING WAS ON CLEAR AND THEN LET ME. JUST TAKE KNOWLEDGE THAT- WE AND YOU ALREADY GOT ALL THOSE GRANTS OUT THAT. GOOD WORK AND APPRECIATED. AND IN GETTING. OUR R. ON BOTH THE THINGS I'VE ASKED ABOUT I'VE GOTTEN LOTS OF FEEDBACK THE ANA. THE INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES WERE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE- BY THE GRANT PROGRAM FOR INFRASTRUCTURE HIM TO BROADBAND TO AMAZON MOVED TO MY DISTRICT DURING RECESS I HEARD ABOUT IT FROM DIFFERENT LIBRARY SO THAT'S A VERY. A GOOD THING LET ME ASK CENTER- CHAU BOGO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THE SIDE. THANK YOU IT I GUESS I'LL START WITH THE COMMON AND THEN IT'S A FOLLOW UP WITH THE QUESTION SO I READ HERE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT- THE BUDGET SPECIFIES THE STATE LIBRARY SURE REQUIRE A LOCAL MATCH. AND I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS BECAUSE I'M I'M THINKING OF MY- AREAS SUCH AS MY CITY WHICH IS I WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO PASS ANY BONDS- FOR CONSTRUCTION- IT JUST IN GENERAL IN IN OUR AREA EVEN WITH THE SENATOR'S ENDORSEMENT. THIS IS PRIOR TO THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT NOW I'M GLAD TO CLARIFY YEAH- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION BUT MY QUESTION IS- HAVE YOU HAD ANY FEEDBACK OR ANY COMMENTARY FROM OUR LIBRARIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE FOR THEM TO HAVE THOSE MATCHING FUNDS AVAILABLE. OR BE PREPARED TO. IN ORDER TO HAVE ACCESS TO THESE CRAMPS. THE SHORT THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES SO THE BUDGET THE BUDGET BILL CONTEMPLATES A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR MATCH. BUT KIND OF A FEW PARAGRAPHS DOWN FROM THAT IT ALSO DISCUSSES THE ABILITY. BASED ON. IT'S A FORMULA THAT CALCULATES KIND OF THE PER CAPITA NOT KIND OF IT'S A FORMULA THAT CALCULATES THE- CAPITA SPENDING IN A JURISDICTION FOR LIBRARIES. AND SO THE LOWER THE PER CAPITA SPENDING IS IN A JURISDICTION. THE MORE THE LIBRARY CAN REDUCE THE MATCH THAT'S REQUIRED SO THERE IS THERE IS A PROVISION IN THERE THERE'S I THINK THERE'S THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS. OF THE PER CAPITA SPENDING SO WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY- THANKS TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO BE ABLE TO MODIFY THAT MATCH REQUIREMENT BASED ON YOU KNOW HOW WELL HOW WELL RESOURCE. THE APPLICANTS. OKAY AND- SO JUST SO THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND. WHAT SORT OF MATCH WHAT WOULD BE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF MATCHING FUNDS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED BY THE LOCAL LIBRARIES IN ORDER TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE FUNDING THAT YOU HAVE. YEAH YOU KNOW I CAN TELL YOU WITH PRECISION LATERAYE AYE AYE FRANKLY FORGOT MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT SOMETHING BUT IT'S BETWEEN 25% AND 30% ON THEIR PART AND SO IN ORDER TO HAVE SO AND I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING THE- LOCAL MEANS OF. HAVANESE FIVE I'M ASSUMING THESE HAVE TO BE THROUGH LOCAL BONDS IN ORDER TO HAVE ACCESS TO FOR THE FOR THE LOCAL I. RECEIVED GABLE TO HAVE THESE MONIES FOR THE GRANT. OR ARE THERE OTHER MEANS OF LOCAL- LIBRARIES TO HAVE ACCESS TO FUNDS BESIDES UPON IN ORDER TO HAVE ACCESS TO THESE GRANTS YEAH IT'S COMPLETE ONE OF THE COOL THINGS ABOUT THIS IS IT'S FLEXIBILITY SENATOR IT DOESN'T- IT DOESN'T ROB ROY. THE LOCAL MATCH CAN COME FROM ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SOURCES WHATEVER MAKES IT WORK IT JUST CAN'T BE IN CON RIGHT. SO IT HAS TO BE SOME KIND OF A- YOU KNOW. MONEY IN OUR MONETARY SORT OF MATCH. THANK YOU FOR THE SOURCE OF THAT MONEY IS WHERE IT'S WERE COMPLETELY AGNOSTIC ON THAT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF COURSE. Q. AND- THAT COMPLETES ISSUE NUMBER SIX AND COMPLETES OUR OVERVIEW OF THE STATE LIBRARY SO- LET ME THANK EVERYBODY ON THE PANELS WE'RE HERE FOR THESE ITEMS WE APPRECIATED AND WE WILL HOLD ALL THESE ITEMS OPEN AND RETURN TO THEM IN MAY AFTER THE MAY REVISE. A WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN WHICH IS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CLIMATE PROPOSALS- WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE MORNING JACK'S WALTERNATE FINANCE. THIS ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO ADVANCING SOLUTIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SEEKS TO LEVERAGE THE EXPERTISE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM TO FURTHER THOSE EFFORTS. THESEINVESTMENTS INCLUDE ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT RESEARCH AND EDUCATION WORK- NOTABLY TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH GRANTS DOUBLES AS TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER FROM THE ACADEMIC REALM- INTO THE PRACTICAL. FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL UND TO SUPPORT CLIMATE TECHNOLOGY INCUBATORS ON CAMPUSES- WHICH COMPLEMENTS OTHER INNOVATION LAB ACTIVITIES- IN ADDITION PUBLIC ASSISTANCE IF YOU SEE. AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR CLIMATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE TO THE HELLO. THERE'S AND CONCENTRATE SOLELY- ARE YOU PROPOSALS HERE THAT HAVE AN OVERARCHING- OBJECTIVE OF HELPING THE STATE ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES WHICH IS A OVER ARCHING REASONABLE OBJECTIVE- BUT THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION LACKING IN THESE PROPOSALS ARE. BUDGET LANGUAGE AND THE LANGUAGE DOESN'T SET FORTH OBJECTIVES FOR THE FUNDS IT DOES NOT SET FORTH CLEAR PARAMETERS OVER HOW THE FUNDS ARE TO BE USED AS AN ESTABLISH ANY SORT OF RETRACTED REPORTING TO ASSIST WITH LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE RECEIVED PROPOSALS LIKE THIS IT OFTEN FACES PRESSURE TO TRY TO CORRECT FOR SOME OF THESE DEFICIENCIES AND THAT TAKES TIME AWAY FROM LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO CRAFTED ITS OWN BUDGET PACKAGE. SO GIVEN THOSE ISSUES WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE CURRENT- TREAT THIS PACKAGE- AND THEN PRIORITIZE CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THIS PACKAGE DIFFERENTLY PRIORITIZING SOME MORE THAN OTHERS. WE THINK THE HIGHEST PRIORITY AREA HERE COULD BE CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH. SUPPORTING MORE CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH COULD HELP THE STATE ADVANCE- IT'S CLIMATE MITIGATION GOALS. AND HELP WITH- COORDINATE LOCAL LAPTOP- ADAPTATION EFFORTS. BERMAN IS ALSO REASONABLE USE OF ONE TIME FUNDING. THAT'S SORT OF THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN PURSUING MORE RESEARCH WE THINK THERE ARE- SEVERAL CHANGES A LEGISLATURE COULD MAKE TO THE PROPOSAL- TWO KEY AREAS WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE COULD FOCUS ON IS ENSURING. A MORE COORDINATION BETWEEN YOU SEE IN THE STATE'S VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCIES. AND WE ALSO RECOMMENDED JUST MORE STATUTORY GUIDANCE OVER THE GOALS OF THE FUNDS THAT SETTING THE PARAMETERS ARE HOW THE FUNDS TO BE USED AND ESTABLISHING REPORTING LANGUAGE. WITH REGARD TO THE PROPOSED CLIMATE TECHNOLOGY INCUBATORS WE THINK THAT COULD BE TREATED AS A LOWER PRIORITY RELATIVE TO RESEARCH. REPORTING MORE CLIMATE TECHNOLOGY INCUBATORS COULD HAVE SOME OF THE SAME BENEFITS AS SUPPORTING MORE RESEARCH TO THE EXTENT THA IT. FOSTERS THE FORMATION OF NEW INDUSTRIES THAT CREATE NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT HELP ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES. THAT'S WHAT THE STATE HAS MANY NUMEROUS- ECONOMIC INNOVATION INITIATIVES AS MANY EXISTING INCUBATORS INCLUDING A FEW REGULATORS A FOCUS ON CLIMATE ISSUES. THERE'S ALSO JUST A LOT OF BASIC INFORMATION LACKING IN THIS PROPOSAL FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T KNOW THE LOCATION OF THE PROPOSED INCUBATORS OTHER SCOPE OF THE LEGISLATURE WERE INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING THIS PROPOSAL. IT WE THINK IT COULD DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION AND UNIVERSITY TO COME BACK WITH A MORE DETAILED PROPOSAL. FINALLY REGARDING THE WORK FORCE ALMOND OF THIS PROPOSAL- WE THINK YOU COULD TREAT THIS AS THE LOWEST PRIORITY AT THE STATE IS ALREADY FUNDING MANY ONGOING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. AND ALSO FUNDED MANY ONE TIME WORKFORCE INITIATIVES IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. INCLUDING SOME THAT APPEAR TO SHARE SOME SIMILARITIES TO- THE UC PROPOSAL COULD REJECT THIS PROPOSAL WITHOUT TRYING TO PROVIDE. MUCH MORE INFORMATION ON IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MOVED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. GOOD MORNING CENTER LAYERED AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I'M SAY EVER KIND OF REPRESENTING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. I'M A CRISIS IS IMPACTING THE LIVES OF ALL CALIFORNIANS WHILE THE STATE LEADERSHIP HAVE TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS TOWARD MITIGATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IT IS CLEAR THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO BOTH MITIGATE AND ADAPT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL COMMITS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S RESOURCES EXPERTISE INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORKS AND PARTNERSHIPS. TO ADDRESS THE STATE'S NEEDS AND ACCELERATE THE STATE'S PROGRESS TOWARDS CLIMATE RESILIENCY GOALS. THE PURPOSE OF THE THREE PROGRAMS IS TO GENERATE IDEAS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS WELL AS A TRAINED WORK FORCE. TO HELP CALIFORNIANS BECOME MORE RESILIENT TO THE CHANGING CLIMATE. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES AN AMBITIOUS PLAN FOR INNOVATIVE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RESEARCH ON CLIMATE ADAPTATION STRATEGIES. THE PROPOSED ONE HUNDRED MILLION FOR RESEARCH WOULD BE PROVIDED FOR CUTTING EDGE TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE. THESE GRANTS WILL BE UNIQUE AND FUNDING INNOVATIVE CONCEPT WORK NOT FUNDED THROUGH-OTHER STATE AGENCIES ARE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE OBJECTIVE WILL BE TO SEEK NEW KNOWLEDGE THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN PREVIOUSLY EXPLORED. REGIONAL INNOVATION INCUBATORS WILL BE AWARDED BASED ON CONSIDERATIONS OF EQUITY REGIONAL CONTEXT LOCAL TRIBAL AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AS WELL AS ABILITY TO LEVERAGE OUTSIDE INVESTMENTS AND RESOURCES. INNOVATION INVESTMENTS ARE CONCEIVED TO COVER A RANGE OF FIELDS AND ACTIITIES SPENDING AGRICULTURE AND HEALTH TRAINING WHAT BLOOD THE MAKER SPACE ACTIVITIES MULTI DISCIPLINARY NETWORKS OF INCUBATION AND LAB FACILITIES. COMBINED INCUBATOR ACCELERATOR AND CO WORKING SPACES THEY WILL BE OPEN TO INNOVATORS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE UNIVERSITY EAST WITH BROAD PARTICIPATION AND ENGAGEMENT FROM INDUSTRY AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR. REGIONAL CLIMATE WORKFORCE HUBS ARE INTENDED PRIMARILY THE SERVER UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS FROM ACROSS THE STATE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS AS WELL AS ALUMNI WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN ALL THE JOB TRAINING FOR HUB FUNDED ACTIVITIES. YOUR CERTIFICATION TRAINING THROUGH PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT B. R. U. C. EXTENSION AND ON THE JOB TRAINING AT THE INNOVATION HUBS WILL PROVIDE THE TOOLS RESOURCES AND SUPPORT THE PREPARE CANDIDATES FOR A RANGE OF COMMUNITY RESILIENCE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES. INCLUDING FOR NON DEGREE SEEKINGINDIVIDUALS. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVES OF THE UNIVERSITY'S CLIMATE RESILIENCY FUNDING ARE TO CONTRIBUTE TO A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT A VIBRANT ECONOMY AND A JUST AND EQUITABLE COMMUNITIES WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND- I'M I DON'T THINK CENTER GROW TROUBLED HAS ANY QUESTIONS IS THAT CORRECT. THEN INSTEAD OF ASKING QUESTIONS I'M GOING TO MAKE A COMMENT AID THAT IS AS SOMEBODY WHO WAS US SECRETARY FOR NATURAL RESOURCES AND IT WAS MENTIONED- ALIGNING WITH THE AGENCIES IN- THE ELIAS'S COMMENTS I WOULD HAVE DIED FOR THIS APPLICATION THIS. IS THROWING IN OUR A AND I SUPPORT. A THIS. ONE ARM ON CLEAR ON IS I AGREE. ARE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S COMMENT ABOUT THE LACK OF DIRECTION OR LACK OF COORDINATION WITH THE AGENCIES IN. ARE THE IMPORTANT THING IS THE STATE'S POLICY. ALL SEIZE ON CLIMATE ARE BASED ON SCIENCE THE QUESTION IS DO WHAT WE NEED AT THE AGENCIES ALIGNED WITH THE RESEARCHER AND FREQUENTLY I SAW THIS IN THE OCEAN SCIENCE TRUST WHICH IS. OCEAN RESEARCHERS FROM ACROSS THE STATE THE DID RESEARCH IN RELATION TO THE STATE THAT MANY TIMES THEY DID RESEARCH ABOUT WHAT THEY THOUGHT THEIR OWN NEEDS WORK. R. FOR RESEARCH NOT WHAT ALIGNED WITH THE STATE PROGRAMS ON OCEAN AND I THINK THERE'S THE POTENTIAL FOR THAT HAPPENING HERE. AND WE STILL. ARE NEED OUR OUR WAY TO QUANTIFY- GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SAVINGS FROM PROGRAMS THAT AFFECT NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS WE STILL NEED TO KNOW SOME OF THE SCIENCE OF OCEANS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT CERTAIN THINGS. CAN DEAL WITH OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND SO THE QUESTION IS CAN WE USE THIS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY. AND UC'S UNIQUE ABILITIES ON RESEARCH TO ALIGN WITH THE RESEARCH NEEDS FOR STATE AGENCIES AND THE STATE CLIMATE PROGRAM AND I THINK THAT POINT WAS MADE BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND I THINK IT'S EXACTLY RIGHT SO. WHAT WHAT I WOULD HOPE IS I THINK THE THAT IF YOU LISTEN TO THE STATEMENTS PARTICULARLY THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THE BULK OF THE STATEMENT WAS ABOUT CLIMATE AND HOW IT'S CHANGING AND THE NEED TO ADDRESS. BUT I THINK THE DUMB PORTANT THING IS HOW IS THIS RESEARCH AND HOWARD THESE ACTIVITIES GOING TO BE FOCUSED IN RELATION TO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. AND WE JUST HAVE SO MANY THINGS AND THEN THE STATE HAS FACILITATED. ARE AT LEAST FOUR DIFFERENT SCIENTIFIC ASSESSMENT. ARE AND I THINK THE LAST ONE THE FOURTH ASSESSMENT HAS BEEN OUT FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS ALREADY. AND IT REALLY LOOKED AT THE STATE AND IT LOOKED AT. OUR GRID WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO PROTECT OUR GRID GIVEN HEAT AND WILDFIRE IT LOOKED AT SOME OF THE OCEANS ISSUES. THEY LOOKED AT WILDLIFE QUARTERS THE FACT THAT THE CLIMATES ARE CHANGING AND A WILDLIFE WILL HAVE TO MOVE IN WAYS THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEFORE. AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THIS RESEARCH IS FOCUSED AND I THINK THUS FAR. IT'S A GENERAL PROPOSAL SO I HOPE THAT. THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE STATE GENCIES WILL WORK BETWEEN NOW AND MAY TO FOCUS THIS SO THAT WHEN IT COMES BACK TO US. WE HAVE CLARITY ON THESE ISSUES EARLY BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE THE BASIS ON WHICH TO APPROVE THIS AND MOVE THIS FORWARD IN MAY AND JUNE IN THE FINAL BUDGET AND AS I SAID I SUPPORT THIS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT IT'S FOCUSED IN A CLEAR WAY AND SO THAT IS JUST A COMMENT AND I THINK. SORT OF A DIRECTION TO THE STAKEHOLDERS. BEFORE THIS COMES BACK. IN AFTER THE MEASURE THANK YOU WE REALLY ARE- APPRECIATE- YOU BEING HERE AND WE ARE GOING TO MOVE. TWO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT WHICH IS THE FOSTER YOUTH PROPOSALS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND WE HAVE- JACK'S WALLED AGAIN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JENNIFER LOUIS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WITH THE KING FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SAY HOW VIRGIN AND AGAIN FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND ROEMER RIO FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND WILL TAKE THE PANEL IN THAT ORDER- SO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WELCOME BACK TO THE- TO THE COMMITTEE. I THINK THE SAGAMORE JACKSON'S FORMER FINANCE- MICHAEL GENERALLY WILL BE HANDLING THE PRESENTATION THIS PARTICULAR ITEM. THANK YOU. YEAH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET I THINK THE SUPPORT POSSIBLE FORMER PROSECUTOR WE'RE SORT OF HAVING TROUBLE HEARING YOU I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S SOMETHING ON YOUR END OR ARE AND MIGHT OKAY SORRY MY% THANK YOU PARDON ME- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES AN INCREASE SUPPORT FOR FOSTER YOUTH AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH ATTENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY WITH ONGOING GENERAL FUND INVESTMENTS OF SIX MILLION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND TWELVE MILLION AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE. BUT THAT I. SHALL COME MY PRE. AND I AM AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THEN WE'RE GONNA GO ON TO A LISA CAME FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. R. SHE NEEDS TO BE ON MUTE- JASON'S ON MUTED OKAY. I JUST RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM MY COLLEAGUE THAT SHE'S EXPERIENCING SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES- I DON'T THINK WE HAD A WHOLE LOT OF COMMON TO OFFER ON ON THIS ITEM- SO IT BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO AND- BROWN ANSWERING QUESTIONS. OKAY AND THEN WILL MOVE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAID. THANK YOU RECOGNIZING TO UNIQUE OBSTACLES FACED BY FORMER FOSTER YOUTH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL INCLUDES SIX MILLION AN ONGOING FUNDS FOR STUDENT SERVICES AND ACADEMIC ADVISING. SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED A FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. THIS ADDITIONAL SUPPORT WILL ASSIST THEM ON THE PATH TO SUCCESSFUL GRADUATION. THESE STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY OVERCOME TREMENDOUS OBSTACLES IN PURSUING THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS BUT STILL FACE UNIQUE AND SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AS THEY MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS GRADUATION. FORMER FOSTER YOUTH ARE TWO AND A HALF MORE TIMES LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS THAN OTHER STUDENTS. AND FAR MORE LIKELY TO REPORT FOOD INSECURITY ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC ADVISING AND SUPPORT SERVICES WOULD HELP THE STUDENTS GET ACCESS TO RESOURCES THEY NEED TO GRADUATE AND THRIVE. WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SIX MILLION. THREE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE ON TO MR MURRAY- FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. A GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TO RAISE TO DISCUSS THIS YEAR'S YOU PROSECUTE PROGRAMS IN- OUR CAMPUSES. WILL PROVIDE A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF OUR PROGRAMS IN THE SYSTEM WILL START WITH THE NUMBER OF PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY CURRENTLY EXIST. THE TWENTY ONE OF TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES CURRENTLY HAVE A FORMER AND CURRENT BUST YOU PROGRAM. IN ONE IS ACTUALLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT. SO BY THE END OF THIS ACADEMIC YEAR WILL SOON HAVE TWENTY TWO OVER TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES WITH THE PROGRAM. IN REGARDS TO ENROLLMENT THE CSU HAS JUST OVER TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED KERN IN FORMER FOSTER YOUTH THAT HAVE SELF IDENTIFIED IN AND ROLLED ON OUR VARIOUS CAMPUSES. THE ACTUAL NUMBER IS PROBABLY LIKELY TO BE A LITTLE BIT LARGER SINCE THERE'S NO OBLIGATION FOR A FORMER OR CURRENT BUST YOU. THE SELF IDENTIFY OVER DISCLOSES THEY HAD BEEN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. BUT WITHIN THE TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS THAT WE HAVE IN THE SYSTEM OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS ARE SPECIFICALLY BEING SERVED BY A FORMER FOSTER YOUTH PROGRAM. NO THAT'S NOT TO SUGGEST THAT THE REMAINING STUDENTS ARE NOT BEING SERVED THE STUDENTS ARE TYPICALLY SERVED BY OUR EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM. THAT PROVIDES A SAFETY NET FOR THE STUDENTS. TO ENSURE THEIR ACADEMIC SUCCESS. IN REGARDS TO FUNDING THE CAMPS OF EURO TO COME. OF STATE EXT FUNDING TO SUPPORT THEIR PROGRAMS. THE STATE FUNDING IS A COMBINATION OF THE CAMPUS GENERAL FUNDS BUT ALSO A VAST MAJORITY OF THEM ALSO UTILIZE FUNDING FROM THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM TO SUPPORT THEIR EFFORTS. BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE EXTERNAL FUNDING THROUGH GRANTS AND FUNDRAISING. REALLY ADDS UP TO ABOUT 60% OF THE OPERATIONAL AND PROGRAM SUPPORT OF OUR PROGRAMS. YOU KNOW MONEY WERE PROGRAMS DO YOU HAVE STRONG INDICATORS OF SUCCESS MANY THE PROGRAMS ARE SHOWING THAT THERE HAVE UP TO NINETY FOUR PERCENT. OF PERSISTENCE RATES AFTER THE FIRST YEAR IN AS HIGH AS EIGHTY THREE PERCENT. OF PERSISTENCE RATES AFTER THE SECOND YEAR OF ENROLLMENT. NOW THE GRADUATION RATES FOR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH IN NATIONALLY AND THOSE WHO PURSUE COLLEGE IS ONLY ABOUT ONE TO FIVE PERCENT. HOWEVER OUR FUSTY PROGRAMS ON OUR CAMPUSES ARE EXPERIENCING UP TO A 60% GRADUATION RATE I REQUEST YOU THAT THEY'RE SERVING. IN THE OTHER INDICATOR THAT WE LOOK AT ALSO IS THE ACADEMIC STANDING IN MOST OF THE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING WITH STUDENTS AT OUR REMAINING STANDING. ELEANOR TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS VERY SUPPORT SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE OF COURSE OUR PROGRAM STAFFING. NOW AS YOU NOTICE FROM THE INITIAL NUMBERS WE DO HAVE. LIMITATIONS ON CAPACITY MOST OF THE PROGRAMS ARE STAFFED BY ONE THE TWO STAFF MEMBERS AND MOST OF THIS MANY OF THE STAFF MEMBERS. ACTUALLY FUNDED THROUGH GRANTS SUPPORT NOT PERMANENT FUNDING. THE BILL WITH ADDITIONAL STAFFING STABILITY IN FUNDING WE CERTAINLY CAN INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF OUR PROGRAMS. HERE THE IMPORTANT IMPORTANT ASPECT OF OUR PROGRAMS IS ACTUALLY CASELOAD MANAGEMENT IN THIS IS TO ENSURE THAT THE FOSTER YOUTH PROGRAMS ARE FIRST YEAR STUDENTS. ARE CLOSELY MONITORED TO ENSURE THEIR ACADEMIC SUCCESS BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THEY'RE SEEKING THE SERVICES OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM TO ENSURE THAT ACADEMIC SUCCESS AND OUR PERSISTENCE ON CAMPUSES. HOUSING IS ANOTHER CRITICAL AREA THAT ARE SORRY IF YOU COULD BEGIN TO WRAP UP. SURE SURE IN THE OTHER CRITICAL SERVICES IS THE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY HERE A. PROGRAM BECAUSE WELL. THE WEATHER FUNDING TO HELP. AND ENHANCE FOSTER PROGRAMS OUT THREE CAMPUSES AND DEVELOP SUPPORT SUPPORTIVE CAMPUS COMMUNITY IS CERTAINLY WELCOME I DO NEED TO POINT OUT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS AN ADD ON BUDGET ITEM AND NOT PART OF THE CSU TRUSTEES BUDGET REQUEST. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND LET BE A ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ONE. SENATOR TROUBLED SHE HAS NO QUESTIONS AND- I WAS JUST GONNA KNOWLEDGE THAT- THAT WE HEARD THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOSTER. CARE ITEM UNDER COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND I DON'T HAVE A BILL. THAT'S WORKING ON THAT THIS THIS JUST SEEMS FINE AND I DON'T I THINK THE REASON WE DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AS WE'RE GENERALLY SUPPORT SO. LET ME THANK EVERYBODY FOR- OF BEING HERE. AND PRESENTED TODAY. ARE WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO- ISSUE NINE WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM CLIMATE PROPOSALS. ARE WE HAVE JENNIFER LOWERY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE SICKENING- FOR JASON FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND BY SAN JUAN FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY LOGO IN THAT ORDER BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BUT AGAIN JENNIFER LEE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. CLOSE THE FOLLOWING ONE TIME INVESTMENTS AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY TO SUPPORT CLIMATE CHANGE INNOVATION WHICH IS EIGHTY THREE MILLION A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE CONSTRUCTIONOF THE CSU BAKERSFIELD ENERGY INNOVATION CENTER AND FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR EQUIPMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AT CSU UNIVERSITY FARMS WITH THAT I. SHALL CONCLUDE MY PRISON. PRESENTATION AND AN ADMIRABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S. GOOD MORNING TRANSCEND OKAY BE THINKING AND LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THE CONCEALED AN EXAMINATION CENTRE AND THE UNIVERSITY PARK SCHOOL SELECTION HERNANDEZ BEGINNING ON PAGE THIRTY. REGARDING PROPOSED BE REYES CAN. WE DON'T THINK THESE FROM HAVE AND NOTABLE KIND OF. REGARDING THE BAKERSFIELD ENERGY INNOVATION CNTER THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO SUPPORTING KIND SEARCH BASED ON PROJECT DATA PROVIDED BY CSU ONLY A SMALL PORTION ROUGHLY 10% OF THE SPACE IS DEDICATED TO RESEARCH. THE SPACE TO THE LEFT TURN ACCESS TO CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE INCLUDES TEACHING LABS TO SUPPORT B. ENGINEERING PHYSICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT. REGARDING UNIVERSITY FARMS HELLO THE REQUESTED FROM CSU LESTER THE SPECIFIC PROJECTS THAT CAMPUS IS LIKE THE PERSON WITH THE PROPOSED FIFTY MILLION CLIMATE RELATED BENEFITS FOR EXAMPLE A PROJECT TO REPLACE OLDER FARM VEHICLES WITH ELECTRIC VEHICLES. OTHER PROJECTS HARPER THE KIND OF RELATED BENEFITS ARE MUCH LESS CARE FOR EXAMPLE A PROJECT PLAN ASKED FACE TWENTY. THIS ISSUE THE REASON IS PROPOSE IS THAT OUR VIEW DON'T REFLECT THE HIGHER PRIOR CAPITAL PER. YES YOU. FOR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE SO HE WAS THIS WITH LEICESTER THREE OUT PRIOR. NO THOSE PRIORITIES ARE TO THE IN. FOR IN ADDITION CENTER IS YES HE PRIORITY LIST. HOW PROJECTS ABOUT THAT IN AN THIS WITHOUT THAT THE- LIKE CVS INCLUDING SIZE OF DEFICIENCY IS. AS WELL AS THE CONTINUATION OF EXISTING CAMPUS OPERATIONS. OVER THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO PRIORITIZE THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS. WITH THIS IN MIND WE RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE CONSIDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS IN THIS ISSUE HERE AS A LOWER SPENDING PRIORITY. IT COULD CONSIDER REDIRECTING THESE FUNDS TOWARD pTHAT BE A HIGHER PRIORITY CAPITAL PROJECTS IF YOU. OR POTENTIALLY PROJECTS IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE A CLEAR ACCESS TO CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. WE WOULD KNOW THE BOTH OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS THIS ISSUE ARE EXCLUDABLE FROM THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT. INTERNAL CHARITIES OF THE FUNDS VERY LIKELY GOING TO BE AS LONG. OKAY THANK YOU FOR MUCH NOW MOVES TO THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. I CAN MORNING THANK YOU TERROR ALERT MY NAME IS FIVE SEVEN ONE I'M THE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR CAPITAL PLANNING. DESIGN CONSTRUCTION FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE PROJECTS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR TO HELP CALIFORNIA PREPARE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE. THE FIRST PROJECT IS THE CSU BAKERSFIELD ENERGY AND ENGINEERING INNOVATION BUILDING THE PROJECT WAS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AS PART OF THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO. TWENTY THREE BUDGET REQUEST. THE PROJECT IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR OUR BIGGEST BILL CAMPUS. WILL ACCOMMODATE THE NEW ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES ACADEMIC PROGRAM IT'LL PROVIDE SPACE FOR THE GROWTH OF. YOUR SCIENCES PHYSICS AND ENGINEERING THE PROVIDE HANDSON LEARNING SPACE FOR THE FABRICATION OF STUDENT PROJECTS MAKERSPACE. THE UNIVERSITY'S ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES PROGRAM WILL COMPLEMENT THE WORK OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY RESEARCH CENTER AND INDUSTRY PARTNERS IN THE RESEARCH AND STUDY AREAS. OF CARBON SEQUESTRATION OF CARBON MANAGEMENT RENEWABLE ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS AND SMART GRID TECHNOLOGY. HANDS ON LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE STEM FIELDS IS A HIGH IMPACT PRACTICE THAT IMPROVES GRADUATION RATES AND IN TURN. THE TENCEL FOR UPWARD MOBILITY OF STUDENTS COMING FROM ECONOMICALLY CHALLENGED AREAS IN THE BAKERSFIELD REGION. ARTICLE BENEFIT STATE IT BY NO ONLY SO RESEARCH IN CLIMATE CHANGE THAT WILL SUPPORT THE LEGISLATURE SCHOOL IMPROVE GRADUATION RATES DEVELOP STUDENTS READY TO SERVE THE STATE'S WORKFORCE NEEDS. IN THE GREEN JOBS INDUSTRY AND PROMOTE APPLIED RESEARCH IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN TRANSFORMING THE ENERGY FIELD. THE SECOND PROJECT WOULD PROVIDE FIFTY MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDS TO SUPPORT AGRICULTURE PROGRAMS AT CSU FRESNO. CHICO CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO AND CAL POLY POMONA. THE CSU AGRICULTURE PROGRAMS INCLUDE LIVING LABORATORIES THE FARMS ORCHARDS LANDS VINEYARDS FOREST AND ANIMAL UNITS COMING COVERING THOUSANDS OF ACRES THE ESTIMATED AGRICULTURAL FACILITY BACKLOG VERNAL OR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE TOTALS OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION. EACH OF THE FOUR CAMPUSES HAVE IDENTIFIED OVER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PROJECTS TO MODERNIZE FACILITIES AND REPLACE AGED INFRASTRUCTURE AND OR EQUIPMENT THESE PROJECTS HELPED TO ADAPT TO A CHANGING CLIMATE BY PERFORMING RESEARCH INCREASING STUDENT ACCESS AND SUPPORTING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SHOULD ONE TIME ADDITIONAL FUNDS BE AVAILABLE FOR. UNIVERSITY I RECALL TERM PROJECTS. POST FIFTY MILLION IN THEGOVERNOR'S BUDGET WOULD BE EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE FOUR CAMPUSES ARE TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION PER CAMPUS A LIST OF PROJECTS HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND LEGISLATIVE. ANALYST'S OFFICE THAT INCLUDE PROJECTS TO PROMOTE TECHNOLOGY INCUBATION ENABLE CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE AND VALUE ADDED PRODUCTION PRACTICES THESE INCLUDE ENERGY EFFICIENT FARM EQUIPMENT WATER IRRIGATION IMPROVEMENTS. IMPROVEMENTS THE CELLS OBISPO DAIRY PROCESSING LAB FRESNO FARM VEHICLE UPGRADES THE MOTIVE BE THERE PERRY. PROGRAM EXPANSION HELP MITIGATE THE LOSS OF THESE CRITICAL TO CROP COLONIZATION AND INCREASE STUDENT ACCESS AT THE PAUL MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY PHARMACY AS YOU TO GO WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN SIXTY THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF THE NAME STATE SENATOR PAUL ELLSBERG. THANK YOU FOR CAN YOUR CONSIDERATION AND SUPPORT OF THE CSU FACILITIES THAT WILL PROMOTE EDUCATION WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND APPLIED RESEARCH AND- THE. DEVELOPMENT OF CLIMATE CHANGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARMY S. TO GIVEN EQUAL. SHE HAS NO QUESTIONS I WOULD. IN A MODIFIED FORM RENEW MY COMMENTS ABOUT THE UC CLIMATE REPORT PROPOSALS THAT WE HADN'T. NOT ARE I NOTED THAT THERE WAS- IT WAS STATED ABOUT THE GOALS OF WORK FORCE GRADUATION RATE- THAT THE CSU SUPPORTED IN THE BUILDING PLAN THAT THERE'S A BACKLOG OF AG MAINTENANCE AND NEED TO UPDATE THE SYLLABUS. BUT THIS MONEY IS SPECIFICALLY FOR CLIMATE AND CLIMATE RESEARCH AND SO WHAT I WOULD REALLY HOPE IS THAT BETWEEN NOW AND MAY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OUR CONCERNS ARE DRESSED AND THAT WHEN WE HAVE A MORE REFINED PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF US IN THE MAY REVISED. IT IS REALLY CLEAR HOW EACH PART ACTUALLY ADDRESSES CLIMATE AND ACTUALLY ALIGNS WITH THE STATE AGENCIES WORK MORE BECAUSE I JUST DON'T THINK THIS IS A- ARE NOT. TO JAM OTHER THINGS IT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT CLIMATE AND SO WHEN THIS COMES BACK TO US. AND WHEN THE GOVERNOR DOES THE MAY REVISE WHICH REFINES HIS PROPOSALS I HOPE THERE'S CLARITY ON EVERY PIECE OF THIS APPROPRIATION AND HOW IT ALIGNS WITH CLIENT THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT TO US. I THANK EVERYBODY ON THIS PANEL. OUR OUR FOR THEIR PRESENTATION AND FOR BEING HERE. WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ISSUE TEN WHICH IS IMPLEMENTATION MPLEMENTATION. OF THE BUDGET ACT AGREEMENTS WITH REGARD TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. AND THE ONE PANELIST WE HAVE IS RUN STORM FROM CALIFORNIA. STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM ARE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. I THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERS- MY NAME IS RYAN STORM HAS SAID NINE THE SYSTEM VICE CHANCELLOR FOR BUDGET FOR THE OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR. I YOUR GENDER CONTAINS SIX ITEMS AND I WILL VERY BRIEFLY DESCRIBE EACH AND LET ME KNOW WHERE WE STAND ON THEM. THE FIRST IS THE DUAL ADMISSIONS ATHLETE PROGRAM NOW THIS PROGRAM CREATES A GUARANTEE THAT A FIRST YEAR STUDENT WILL BE ADMITTED TO ISSUE CAMPUS TWO YEARS AS A TRANSFER STUDENT. IF THAT'S A STUDENTS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING THE SERVICE YET DEGREE FOR TRANSFER SIMILAR. SORT OF PROGRAM. NOW THE PROGRAM IS- SCHEDULED TO COMMENCE IN THE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR ACADEMIC YEAR IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN SEVERAL PLANNING STAGES HERE. THAT INCLUDES A WORKING ON A COMMUNICATIONS PLAN TO ENSURE THAT HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELORS ARE AWARE OF THIS UPCOMING OPPORTUNITY SO STILL MORE TO COME PROJECT ISN'T COMPLETED AT THIS POINT. THE SECOND ON YOUR AGENDA IS THE HUMBOLDT CAMPUS- TRANSITION TO A POLITECNICA RECIPE. NOW THIS IS NEVER REQUIRE SOME SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS THE ACADEMIC AND CAPITAL PROGRAM- NEEDS TO GROW STEM PROGRAMS BEYOND WHERE THEY ARE TODAY. YEAH THE CAMPUS ORIGINALLY PREPARED A POLYTECHNIC THE PROCESS PERSPECTIVES LAST FALL IN THE TRUSTEES RECENTLY CHANGED THE NAME OF THE CAMPUS CAL POLY HUMBLE IN JULY. AND JANUARY SORRY. ALSO ON THE ACADEMIC SIDE OF THE HOUSE HUMBOLDT IS ON TRACK- WITH PROPOSED AND NEWLY ESTABLISHED ECONOMIC PROGRAMMING FOR THE CAMPUS IS PERSPECTIVES. ALREADY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE HAVE A BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREES APPROVED IN MARINE BIOLOGY AND DATA SCIENCE. IN THE NEXT MONTH THE TRUSTEES WILL CONSIDER APPROVAL POSITIONAL DEGREES- SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS WILL BE. READY TO ADMIT STUDENTS AS EARLY AS FALL TWENTY THREE AND OTHERS WILL BE IN TWENTY FOUR ANDTWENTY FIVE. AGAIN THESE ARE BACHELORS AND MASTERS AND SCIENCES IN AREAS LIKE APPLY FIRE SCIENCE BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPUTER AND INFORMATION. TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING NURSE. ON ACCOUNT OF PRUDENT SIDE OF HUMBOLDT OF THE CAMP STARTED PLANNING FOR INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AND AN UPDATE TO ITS PHYSICAL MASTER PLAN. I COMMUNITY HOUSING FOR STUDENTS SEVERELY LIMITED- ON THE NORTH COAST THEREFORE ACQUISITION AND CONSTRUCTION OF NEW STUDENT HOUSING IS A TOP PRIORITY ALONG WITH A NEW ENGINEERING SLASH HOUSING PROJECT. APPLIED RESEARCH PROJECTS AND FACILITY RENOVATIONS ON FOR THOSE DISCOUNT PROGRAMS. THE TOP- PROJECT- PRIORITY PROJECTS ARE SCHEDULED TO BE COMPLETED IN LATE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND THEN PERHAPS IN OTHER PROJECTS AND FALL BY FALL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE I WANT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES NOTED BY MY COLLEAGUE BY SAN JUAN IS THAT CONSTRUCTION COST ESCALATION IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT NOT ONLY NOT AT THAT CAMPUS AND ELSEWHERE THROUGHOUT THE STATE NOT SHOULD BE SURPRISED AND- THE THIRD ITEM. ON YOUR AGENDA IS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS TO STUDENTS- THE BUDGET ACT PROVIDED THIRTY MILLION TO SUPPORT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS TO LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO ENROLLED T LEAST HALF TIME. THEY DEMONSTRATED AND MERGING SEA NEED IN THEIR UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES. AND DIFFERENT AT LEAST A GRADE POINT AVERAGE OF TWO POINT OUR RECENT TERM. ALL THE FUNDING HAS BEEN DISPERSED BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO THE CAMPUS SO IT'S IN THERE WILL HOUSE THE MOMENT. IN OUR GUIDANCE TWO CAMPUSES WAS BASED ON THE BUDGET ACT LANGUAGE IT WAS YOU KNOW PRETTY COMPLICATED TERMS IF YOU CAN AND WHAT WHO COULD WHO COULD. BE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT. GRANT FUNDING. NOW CAMPUS FINANCIAL AID OFFICES ARE PARTNERED WITH SUCH PLACES AS THEIR BASIC NEEDS- AREAS AND NOT. TO GET THE WORD OUT TO STUDENTS AND SO FAR WE HAVE ABOUT SEVENTY FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS RECEIVED THESE GRANTS. ACROSS TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. I AND- I JUST WANT TO NOTE HERE THAT THIS CAR THAT WAS CREATED IS LAID INTENSIVE. IT HAS TO BE DETERMINE ON A CASE CASE BASIS WE HAVE STOPS. STILL WE HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE OUR CAMPUS IS REACHING OUT TO STUDENTS AND TRYING TO ASSESS WHAT THEIR SITUATION IS. BUT THAT STATE CAMPUSES HAVE PLANS IN PLACE TO EXPAND THE FUNDS BY THE END OF THE ACADEMIC YEAR. SO STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS ON THAT ON THAT PROGRAM. FORESEE IS THE- SALAS SAID THIS WAY YOUR AGENDA BUT IT IS THE GLOBAL. I HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTION EQUITY INNOVATION THAT. PROGRAM HAS CHANGED ITS NAME AND ITS ON THE NORTHRIDGE CAMPUS. NOW THE PURPOSE OF IT IS A FACILITY AND ASSOCIATE KROGER PROGRAM THAT WILL BE TO INSPIRE TRADITIONALLY UNDERSERVED GRADES SIX THROUGH FOURTEEN STUDENTS TO PURSUE A STEM DEGREE. YOUR HANDS ON. IS DESIGN PHASES AND THAT'S UNDER WAY- THE CHALLENGE THOUGH WITH THIS IS THAT THE TOTAL PROJECT COST IS FORTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS THIS POINT. AND ONE TIME FUNDING PROVIDED THEIR BUDGET WAS TWENTY FIVE ONE DOLLAR SO THE NORTHRIDGE CAMPUS IS WORKING ON FUND RAISING TO COVER THE DIFFERENCE IN CONSTRUCTION WILL COMMENCE WHEN THAT OCCURS. THE ITEM IS CSU STANISLAUS. THE STOCKTON CENTER ENROLLMENT ISSUE. THE BUDGET ACT PROVIDED A MILLION DOLLARS TO ENROLL AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED FIFTEEN STUDENTS AT THE CENTER- STAND STATE CONTINUES TO PROMOTE THE STOCKTON CENTER TO ITS LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES LIKE DELTA COLLEGE. LATER THIS YEAR THE CAMPUS WILL FINISH ITS ADMISSIONS CYCLE AND YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF THE ANTICIPATED FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO ENROLLMENT AT THE CENTER. AND RIGHT NOW THE CAMPUS IS IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING SIX FULL TIME FACULTY THAT WILL BE SIGNED IT STOCKTON. EXPAND CURRENT PROGRAMS AND PREPARE NEW PROGRAMS. AS A RESEARCH STUDY ARE IN EDUCATION SOCIAL WORK CHILD DEVELOPMENT IN NURSING AND NEW PROGRAMS- NEW DEGREE PROGRAMS WOULD BE A LOGISTICS SUPPLY CHAIN AS WELL AS OPERATION AND THE CAMPUS THIS POINT IS. THAT IT WILL BE GET BAD AND WRONG GROWTH GOAL BY THE TWENTY TWO THREE HERE. SIX AND FINALLY COMPUTING INITIALLY AT SEA MONTEREY BAY. YEAH GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM IS RECRUIT INCREASE FIRST AND COMPLETION RATES TO COMPETE SCIENCE MAJOR. AND LARGELY FOR UNDERSERVED UNDERSERVED STUDENTS. INITIALLY THE CORPORATE SLABS CURRICULUM WITH DIRECT CONNECTION TO THE TECH INDUSTRY. ALSO IT'S BEEN UNDER WAY FOR A WHILE- IT WAS A GRANT RECIPIENT A SPECIAL WORSE TO BE IN A FEW YEARS AGO FROM THE GOVERNOR'S INNOVATION AWARDS. BUT I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE INITIATIVE HAS DEVELOPED PARTNERSHIPS ALREADY WITH OTHER C. ISSUES YOU SEEM TO BE COLLEGES AND CURRENTLY INCLUDES ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY STUDENTS ACROSS FORTY INSTITUTIONS. AND WITH IT TEN MILLION DOLLARS WE PLAN TO UTILIZE CAMPUS PLANS UTILIZE THAT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS TO SUSTAIN THE PROGRAM EXPANDED SOMEWHAT. NOT INCLUDE MY COMMENTS. THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH US SENATOR- TROUBLE GIVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THE SIDE OF- JUST CLARIFICATION PURPOSES- MR TRUMP WOULD YOU MIND. RESETTING DID YOU SAY THAT THERE WAS A NEW PROGRAM FOR LOGISTICS. YES SO WHAT THE WHAT UNDER THE STOCKTON STOCKTON CENTER WHICH IS IN CENTER ASSOCIATED WITH THE STANISLAUS CAMPUS- THERE WAS A GIRL IT REALLY GROSS- THAT WAS PROVIDED FOR SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT CENTER. INTO THE CAMPUS HAS PLANS TO DEVELOP A NEW DEGREE PROGRAM THERE IN THE CHEST X. AND SUPPLY CHAIN. AND I'M KIND OF CURIOUS HOW DO THEY DECIDE THAT SPECIFICS- CAMPUS- TO DEVELOP THE PROGRAM AND I'M I'M ASKING JUST BECAUSE I'M FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE. AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE INLAND BARS QUITE THE LOGISTICS- WAREHOUSE AB HUB FOR CALIFORNIA PER SE. AND IN MY MIND NOT TAKING AWAY FROM STOCKTON- BUT- WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOGICAL CHOICE TO HAVE THEM UP OF THIS. CALIBER IN A CAL STATE SALMON DINO. YEAH YOU KNOW I'M I'M NOT- REPRESENTING THE ACADEMIC AND STUDENT- SIDE OF OUR HOUSE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SO I DON'T HAVE THE DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE THAT I'M ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES COULD PERHAPS PROVIDE YOU BUT ESSENTIALLY THE SHORTHANDED GOALS IS THAT WHENEVER THERE IS A DESIRE TO DEVELOP A NEW ACADEMIC PROGRAMS IT ORIGINATES AT THE CAMPUS IN ERECTING ORIGINATES WITH THE- THE ACADEMIC FACULTY AS WELL AS THE ADMINISTRATORS ON CAMPUSES. NOW THE CHALLENGE OF COURSE IS THAT YOU NEED FUNDING IN ORDER TO. HIGHER FACULTY AND STAFF TO SUPPORT THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS. AND WHEN YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF EXISTING DEGREE PROGRAMS AND NUMBER FACULTIES SPECIALIZE IN THOSE OTHER DEGREE PROGRAMS DOES TAKE A LITTLE WHILE TO DEVELOP THOSE PROGRAMS. SO IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THAT STANDS STATE WE HAVE THAT- OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE OF ENROLLMENT GROWTH TO- YOU KNOW. EXPAND PRETTY PRETTY CREATIVE BRANDING PROGRAM HERE THE STOCKTON CENTER. BUT I THINK WHAT WHAT FROM YOUR VANTAGE POINT WOULD BE WOULD BE IF IT STARTS AT THE GRASSROOTS ON CAMPUS AND THEN- PERCOLATES UP. THOSE PROGRAMS ARE THEN IF THERE EXAMPLE ON JEOPARDY THERE'S DESIRE TO CREATE A SIMILAR LOGISTICS SUPPLY CHAIN DEGREE PROGRAM. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THE KIDS THAT THE CAMPUS WOULD PUSH UP TO THE CHANCES OFFICE ALTERNATELY THE TRUSTEES APPROVED. THOSE NEW DEGREE PROGRAMS- AND THEN THEY COULD GET GOING TRANSPIRING DEVELOPING SO I'M SURE IF YOU ASKED AT PRESENT TO MOST ROBUST AT SAMPOERNA DINO I'M SURE HE HAS SEVERAL PROGRAMS HE SAID HE WOULD LOVE TO LAUNCH. HOWEVER THIS IS A LIMITATION TERMS OF NOT OF MONEY YOU CAN DO IN ORDER TO TAKE MARCHES PROGRAMS I WILL SAY ONE OTHER THING I WOULD JUST SAY WELL PLAYED. WELL PLAYED VERY SO WELL THE OTHER THING TO OF COURSE IS THAT- THERE'S DEMAND STUDIES TO THAT CAMPUS IS PURSUED THE CITY LOOK TO SEE WHETHER THERE'S ACTUALLY DEMAND ON ON A PARTICULAR CAMPUSES. FOR THOSE TYPES OF DEGREES BEFORE THE LAUNCH THEY DON'T WANT TO WANT SOMETHING NOBODY SHOWS SO THAT'S. ANOTHER ASPECT TO. WELCOME FIRST FROM HELP ME UNDER THE- HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU. S. THE DEMAND IS WHAT I'M SAYING WITHOUT A PER AND- YOU CAN. JUST IT REALLY STARTS WITH THE CAMPUS THEY CAN'T COMMUNITY. ARE BOTH THE BACK. THERE AS WELL AS THAT THE CAMPUS. YEAH NOW ALL OF THEM OBVIOUSLY HOUSE HAVE THEIR FINGERS. ON PULSE WOULD HAVE LOCAL- AND SO. THEY WOULD DO KNOW WHETHER THEY TO. IT MAKES SENSE TO. PROGRAMS SO- BUT IT'S THE CAMP. PERFECT ALL KEEP THAT IN MY- I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A- SUCH AS THAT IN IN OUR AREA TO. OUR LOCAL. JOB. JOB REQUIREMENTS THE YOU. THANK YOU VERY. AND I JUST HAVE A COLUMN. ABOUT- ONE IS A- IS THAT. ARE WITH REGARD TO WHAT'S CENTER ROADSHOW BOGUE JUST ASKED IT'S BECOME REALLY CLEAR TO ME. THIS YEAR THAT. THERE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMATIC DIFFERENT KIND OF PRIORITY. ASSESS FOR THEIR BUDGET WHICH IS THEY'RE ALLOWING THE INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES TO GO DIRECTLY TO LEGISLATORS FOR ITEMS THAT ARE NOT. IN THE CSU'S OVERALL REQUESTED SO THAT'S WHY I SAID WELL PLAYED HE WAS SERVING YOU UP TO THAT PROCESS WHEN HE- HE MADE THAT COMMENT. SENATOR I MUST INTERRUPT. WE WANT TO BE SPECIFIC THAT THIS IS ONLY RELATED TO ONE TIME FUNDING FACT THAT WE NEED TO FIND OUR RECURRING SPENDING BUDGET REQUESTS CONSISTENT WITH THE BOARD WEALTHY ARE YOU. REALLY APPRECIATE THAT- THAT ADDITION THAT IS EXACTLY TRUE AND- IN OUR APPRECIATE YOUR COURAGE AND INTERRUPTING THE CHAIRS WILL A SECOND WEEK- D. R. I WANTED TO SAY THAT THERE'S AN INTERESTING SUBTEXT TO WHAT'S THE STORY OF THEHOUR WITH REGARD TO CAL STATE. STANISLAUS AND THE STOCKTON CENTER IS THAT BEFORE WE HAD THE LAWSUIT IT'S GOTTEN ALL THE HEADLINES AT UC BERKELEY ABOUT ENROLLMENT. WE WERE ASKING AT THIS COMMITTEE. ON HOW NOT. J. JAM ALL EXIST AND RUN INTO CURRENT PLACE AND HOW TO HAVE. FOR EXPANSION AND THAT THE STATE PRESS. OUR ARMED AT STAR IS A WAY TO. ADDRESSED THE HAVE SENT THAT ARE LOW. THAT THE L. EXISTING. THAT MIGHT BE. GENERALLY BUILT OUT AT THEIR MAIN LOCATIONS AND- GROWTH IN A WAY THAT SERVES COMMUNITIES BETTER AT AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE THE LAWSUIT KLOPP THIS WHOLE ISSUE ON THE- THE FRONT PAGE. AND THEN THE THIRD THING THAT I WOULD SAY IS I'M SURE THAT THERE SOME PEOPLE WATCHING AT HOME. THAT WONDER WHY WE WENT THROUGH THIS LIST AND THAT LIST WAS THE IMPORTANT EXERCISE IN ITSELF BECAUSE- WE OF THE LEGISLATURE HAVE TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE. THAT THINGS ARE BEING SPENT WE APPROPRIATE AND JUST AS MR STORM MADE THE COMMENT ABOUT ONE TIME FUNDING THESE WERE ONE TIME FUNDING ITEMS FROM LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. FOR THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR AND THIS IS OUR WAY JUST BY THE FACT THAT HE HAD TO GO THROUGH EACH ONE AND REPORT THE PROGRESS IT'S OUR WAY OF DOING THE OVERSIGHT AND MAKING SURE THAT. THE LIGHT SHINES ON WHAT ARE APPROPRIATIONS WERE AND HOW THEY ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED SO- I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY BEING PRESIDENT. OF FOR THIS ITEM AND- THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THE REPORTS IN THE STATE'S. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO. ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN. WHICH IS INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION OF BUDGET ACT AGREEMENTS AND OVERSIGHT JUST AS THE LAST ITEM BUT THIS TIME FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND THE PANEL SAID TO CONSIST IN ITS ENTIRETY OF LISETTE NAVARETTE FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE- OF WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU CHAIR. CHAIRMAN LAYERED- AND SENATOR- CHEWABLE WAS THAT EVER AN EXECUTIVE YOU INSERT THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGES. HELPING COLLEGES ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO HELP RESIDENTS FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS IMPROVE THEIR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY FOR THEIR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. VERY GLAD THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS MADE SEVERAL AND BASS INVESTMENT IN BASIC NEEDS THE COMMITTEE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN RECEIVING IMPLEMENTATION UPDATE ON FIVE ITEMS BASIC NEEDS TO STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. ZERO TEXTBOOK COST AGREES FULL TIME FACULTY AN EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM FUNDING IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I HAVE PROVIDED A WRITTEN IMPLEMENTATION UPDATE BUT I WILL COVER A FEW HIGH LEVEL POINTS ON EACH OF THESE ITEMS. THE FIRST IS AROUND BASIC NEEDS- THESE RESOURCES A BEN ESSENTIAL THAT- BUDGET INCLUDES A HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME FOR CALIFORNIA CAN COLLEGES TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE BASIC NEEDS SERVICES. IN OUR IMPLEMENTATION WE'VE COUPLED THIS WITH AN INVESTMENT THAT WAS ALSO MADE BY THE LEGISLATURE FOR THIRTY MILLION IN BASIC NEEDS CENTERS. THE GOAL IS TO- BIRD USE EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT GAPS UNDER AMONGST ON A TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENT POPULATIONS TO SUPPORT BASIC NEEDS HELP MAINTAIN FOOD PANTRIES AND ASSIST STUDENTS WITH- CALFRESH ENROLLMENT- SECURE HOUSING AMONGST OTHER CORE NEEDS THAT STUDENTS HAVE IDENTIFIED. THE TEAMSTERS OFFICE UTILIZED A SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS FRAMEWORK AND GUIDING ITS BASIC NEEDS SYSTEM WIDE INITIATIVES I PROVIDED MORE BACKGROUND ON WHAT THIS FRAMEWORK IS AND HOW WE'RE UTILIZING IT TO LEVERAGE LONG TERM INVESTMENTS IN SUPPORT- IN SHORT IT FOCUSES ON FINANCIAL STABILITY. HOLDEN MENTAL HEALTH AND SUPPORT NETWORKS- BETTER. QUARTER TO THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS FOR OR EDUCATE SIX- ITS- EARLY ON IN SOME OF THE- MEASURES AND DATA. IN DOUBLE. CURRENTLY FIFTY. OTHER COLLEGES ALREADY ESTABLISHED PHYSICAL BASIC NEEDS CENTERS AND- THE MAJORITY OF THEM HAVE- INCLUDED ALL THE DETAILS NEEDED- IN THEIR WEBSITES FOR BASIC NEEDS SERVICES AND OTHER COURSE AS INDICATED IN THAT BUDGET INVESTMENT. LET ME SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES I'M OVER IN THE FALL WE CONDUCTED A TOUR OF EIGHT COLLEGES AND I CAN EMPHASIZE THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS STUDENTS IDENTIFIED MOST NEEDING ESPECIALLY AS THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES RECOVER FROM THIS ENDEMIC. THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PROVIDED ON GOING FUNDS OF THIRTY MILLION WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THESE ON GOING FUNDS I WE'VE ALLOCATED THESE RESOURCES ALREADY PROVIDING DISTRICTS BASED FUNDING OF SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. PLUS THE REMAINING BALANCE APPROPRIATED ACCORDING TO THIS TOTAL HEADCOUNT OF THAT OF DISTRICT AND- ON STUDENT NEED- LOOKING AT HEALTH AS THE MEASURE. WE'VE ALSO IN CALL TO LEVERAGE THEIR GUIDED PATHWAYS FRAMEWORK TO USE THESE FUNDS TO DESIGN AND DELIVER REALLY DELIVERY MODEL THAT IS CONNECTED TO OTHER CORE ACADEMIC AND ON SUPPORT SERVICES ULTIMATELY HELPING THEM SUCCEED MEAN VERY RESOURCES ON THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS WEBSITE AND WE CONTINUE AND WILL OFFER MORE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO SEE THIS COLLEGES AND IMPLEMENTATION COLLEGES REPORT ANNUALLY ON THESE FUNDS. LET ME SHARE ABOUT ZERO TEXTBOOK COST AGREES OUR GOALS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ZERO TEST CLUSTER GREASE ARCH REDUCE THE OVERALL COST OF EDUCATION DECREASE TIME TO COMPLETION. ARTIST I REQUEST FOR APPLICATION IS OUT I'M INTERESTED COLLEGES AND- THOSE DISTRICTS WILL RECEIVE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH DEGREE THAT DAY THAT THEY DEVELOP AND MEETS THE CRITERIA. WILL SHARE MORE- AS WE EMBARK ON THIS WORK WE ARE CREATING A TASK FORCE TO EXAMINE SYSTEMIC TEXTBOOK AFFORDABILITY ISSUES AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO SHARE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AS THE TASK FORCE COMPLETED WORK. LET ME MOVE TO INVESTMENT IN FACULTY THE BUDGET ACT- OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE PROVIDED A HUNDRED MILLION I'M GOING TO HIRE NEW FULL TIME FACULTY IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF FULL TIME FACULTY TOWARDS MEETING THE 7525% GOAL DISTRICTS HAD THE OPTION TO ELECT TO DECLINE THE ALLOCATION. OF THESE FUNDS A TOTAL OF SEVENTY TWO OR IT ARE A SEVENTY OVER SEVENTY TWO DISTRICTS ELECTED TO ACCEPT THE FUNDS AND THOSE WERE DISTRIBUTED- IN THE SUMMER IN LATE SUMMER SO THAT COLLEGES AND DISTRICTS COULD BEGIN HIRING- IMMEDIATELY. THE MECCA TO MEASURE TWENTY SEVEN FIVE TWENTY GOAL. AND FROM MY- COMPLY. IS TO THE FACT OF NUMBER KNOWN AS THE FOR. DISTRICTS MUST WITH- FULL TIME. ON DATA ANNUALLY AND WE- DISTRICTS I WORK TOWARDS MEETING THEIR FACULTY APPLICATION NUMBER IN VANCE FALL REPORTING. LET ME CONCLUDE BY PROVIDING AN UPDATE ON EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY PRACTICES THEIR BUDGET PROVIDED TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME- FOR THE TEAMSTERS OFFICE IN THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS TO ALLOCATE TO SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION OF BEST PRACTICES. UTILIZING THE MULTIPLE METHODS- MODEL ON THIS METHOD FOCUSES ON HIRING SPREE HIRING HIRING AND HOST HIRING. I THESE RESOURCES ARE CRITICAL WE USUALLY ONLY HAVE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH DISTRICT- TO IMPLEMENT THE E. O. PROGRAMS EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY PROGRAMS. HOWEVER THESE FUNDS PROVIDED- AN OPPORTUNITY TO EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES THAT CAN ALSO COMPLEMENT THE HIRING THAT IS HAPPENING AROUND FULL TIME FACULTY OR OTHER OR SUPPORT. THEIR- IF YOUR- FOR BACKGROUND. IN ORDER TO GET E. O. FOR DISTRICTS THREE. ON PENALTIES FOR NOT MEETING THEIR FACULTY OBLIGATION NUMBER INSTEAD THIS OUTDATED AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE OF FORMULA MEANT THAT- IN ORDER TO- HIRED UNDER EQUAL EMPLOYMENT DISTRICTS WERE INSTEAD- FOCUSED ON NOT NEEDING ANOTHER CORE MEASURE FOR THESE REASONS WE BELIEVE THAT AN ONGOING ALLOCATION TO FURTHER ADVANCE YOUR PRACTICES. AS PROPOSED IN THE TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE BUDGET IS A FACTOR FOR A LONG TERM STRATEGY THAT PROVIDES PLANING ACCOUNTABILITY AND SOLIDIFIES EFFECTIVE PRACTICES ACROSS ALL OF OUR INSTITUTIONS. I HOPE THIS IS HELPFUL AGAIN MORE DETAILS ARE PROVIDED IN OTHER WRITTEN UPDATED HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE SENATE ROADSHOW BUGTI OF QUESTIONS ON THE SIDE. YES I DO THANK YOU SO MUCH AS I CAN ABOUT THE FOR YOUR REPORT I HAD A QUESTION WITH THE FULL TIME AND PART TIME FACULTY BECAUSE I. SORT OF. ADDRESS THE- IN OUR PAST COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND IN THE SENSE THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS EXPECTATION OF SCHOOLS HAVING A CERTAIN TYPE OF ENROLLMENT AND THEN TRY TO FIGURE OUT OKAY WELL WE HAVE THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WE HAVE FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE STUDENTS BUT MY ALL BUT THE OTHER CONCERNING QUESTION WAS WITH REGARDS TO THE FACULTY ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW. IN POSITION WITH THEM YES THE SHORTAGES THAT WE HAVE IN IN EDUCATION SO MY QUESTION WAS THE FOLLOWING WHAT IS CONSIDERED A FULL TIME FACULTY- AT AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS IT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF CLASSES THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE TEACHING OR IS IT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS- THAT THEY THEY'RE THEY'RE SERVING BECAUSE OF COURSE- AS A FORMER TEACHER I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW. EACH STUDENT TAKES SOME TIME SPECIALLY AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL I'M IS SO JUST GONNA HERE IS WHAT IS CONSIDERED A FULL TIME FACULTY- AT AT. AT YOUR AT YOUR SCHOOL. YEAH COLLEGES- FULL TIME TEACHER LOW. SO SINCE. AT THAT THE TIME CREDIT HOURS OF DIRT FOUR HOURS AFTER. THAT'S NOT MEASURED. ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THEY SERVE INSTEAD IS REALLY LOOKING AT THEIR CLASS LOAD. IN CLASS LOAD YOU MEAN HOW MANY. COURSES THAT THEY'RE TEACHING. YEAH THAT'S LOOKING AT THE CLASSES THAT THEY'RE TEACHING AS WELL AS- THE TIME THAT THAT CLASS NEEDS SO WE DO HAVE SOME BETTER FOR EXAMPLE THREE UNIT CLASSES AS OPPOSED TO ONE UNIT CLASSES. FOR THE- CLASS LOAD IS MEASURED DIFFERENTLY FOR THOSE- BUT- THE A FACULTY MEMBER- HAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HOURS THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE BEING A FULL TIME FACULTY STATUS. AND WHAT WHAT'S THE NUMBER FOR THOSE CLASS WHAT IS THAT KIND OF LOOKS LOOK LIKE. WE HAVE- AND I'M DRAWING A BLANK RIGHT NOW BUT I POLICY HIS- SO THE FACULTY LOAD HOURS IT THE RACE FIVE. IN AND IT'S TOTAL HOURS. IS THAT SEMESTER PER YEAR PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON- THAT CALCULATION HOW IT'S MEASURED- IF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND USEFUL CONTACTS IT WOULD BE JUST BECAUSE IT GIVES ME AN IDEA AS TO HOW MANY. FIRST OF ALL HOW MANY FACULTY YOU FOLKS HIGHER WITH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS BEING ALLOCATED AS WELL AS HOW MANY STUDENTS WILL BE POTENTIALLY SERVING AND HOW MANY CLASSES WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE- YOU KNOW MUCH OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HEAR FROM STUDENTS THAT THEY'RE NOT. ABLE TO. GET THE CLASSES THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO GRADUATE ON TIME SO THIS IS JUST A LITTLE BIT. FOR ME UP JUST A LITTLE HELPFUL IT MIGHT BE FOR AUDIENCE AS WELL TO. UNDERSTAND WHAT IT TAKES TO. TO WHAT TYPE OF TEACHERS WE ARE HOW MANY TEACHERS THAT WE NEED- CLASSES DO WE NEED. AND THE STUDENTS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY. READILY AND APPROPRIATELY F. AB OFFICIALLY SERVE- IN OUR SCHOOLS SO THANK YOU SO MUCH I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. ABSOLUTELY WE'LL FOLLOW UP WITH THAT FREE- FOR CONTEXT AND EXPLANATION AND HAPPY TO. SEE YOU- ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FOLLOWING MEMORY. OKAY THANK YOU ASCENDER I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IN THE FIRST ONE IS AS YOU REPORTED ON THE STUDENT BASIC NEEDS ALLOCATION BASED ON LAST YEAR'S. A ONE TIME PROP NINETY EIGHT PROPOSAL AND WHILE IT DOESN'T REQUIRE A REPORT ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. MORE BEING PRESSED IN THIS BUDGET TO DO ORE FOR BASIC STUDENT NEEDS THOSE ARE WHY THERE MIGHT BE IN TERM REPORT SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE BUDGET HERE AND THEN IF WE ARE BEING ASKED TO DO SOMETHING ADDITIONAL. WE HAVE AN IDEA HOW WE MATCH YOU WITH WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE. ABSOLUTELY CURRENTLY WE CONDUCTED A SURVEY TO GET A SENSE OF- HOW MANY DISTRICTS HAVE IMPLEMENTED. AND ESTABLISH THEIR BASIC NEEDS CENTERS WE CAN FOLLOW UP IN VARIOUS SURVEYS TO GET A SENSE- IMPLEMENTATION. ON ONE AREA WE HAVE SEEN VERY POSITIVE IS AROUND ACCORDING IN MAKING- BASIC NEEDS RESOURCES AVAILABLE- PROMINENTLY. ON WEBSITE SO THAT STUDENTS CAN FIND THEM AS YOU KNOW WEBSITES NOW OR IN MANY WAYS THE WELCOME CENTER FOR COLLEGES- MY STUDENTS TURN TO THOSE FOR. MORE INFORMATION SO. WE'LL GET WE CAN FOLLOW UP ON- STATUS UPDATES- IN ADVANCE OF ME REVISED. OKAY WE APPRECIATE THAT AND THEN. THE NEW SORRY I CAN EVEN WHAT THE ACRONYM FUND STANDS FOR- FACULTY OBLIGATION NUMBER OKAY. M. BUT UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT ABOUT THE WHAT THE ACRONYM WAS FOR BECAUSE THE BUDGET ACT YOU MENTIONED THAT IT. IS DESIGNED SINCE IN SMALL PART TO ADDRESS THAT AND SO. THE THE INCREASE IN HIRING FULL TIME FACULTY HOW WILL YOU BE ABLE TO TELL. WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S AFFECTED THAT NUMBER AT THE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES I MEAN DO YOU KNOW ALREADY THAT ARE YOU WAITING TO COMPILE THAT DATA HOW WILL THAT- BE CLEAR. WE HAVE A TO SHARE MORE DETAILS SO DISTRICTS HAVE TO REPORT ON SOMETHING CALLED THERE THE IS YOU KNOW THAT FACULTY OBLIGATION NUMBER THEY DO THIS EVERY YEAR SO IN ORDER TO- FOR THOSE DISTRICTS THAT DID ACCEPT THE FULL TIME FACULTY FUNDS THEY ALSO ACCEPTED THEIR FACULTY OBLIGATION NUMBER INCREASING AND THEY HAVE TO REPORT ON PROGRESS TOWARDS MEETING THAT INCREASES BY FALL OF EACH YEAR IN SO- WE EXPECT THAT DATED TO COMMAND MOST HIRING HOPPER HAPPENS AROUND THE SPRING TERM. AND SO WE KNOW THAT DISTRICTS ARE BUT I GET THE GIST OF IT IS THAT YOU WANT NOW BY THE TIME OF THE MAY REVISE IF THOSE THAT ACCEPTED MONEY ON THIS ONE FACT HAVEN'T CHANGED FACULTY OBLIGATION NUMBER- THE FACT. OBLIGATION DID GO ON WHAT WE KNOW BY FALL IS WHETHER THEY PER COMPLIANCE WITH THAT INCREASE THAT IS REQUIRED. SO WE DON'T KNOW OR DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. SO YOU HAVE THE FACTS BUT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY COMPLIED. YES WE MEASURE COMPLIANCE IN THE FALL TO ENABLE TIME- FOR HIRING. I'M NOT HIRING HAPPENS AROUND THIS HERO EVEN THOUGH YOU EXCUSE ME FOR INTERRUPTING EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE THE NUMBERS AND- IT IN THE SPRING YOU WON'T KNOW IF THEY COMPLIED TOTAL FALL. ABSOLUTELY SO WE WON'T BE ABLE TO MAKE AN ASSESSMENT OF. WHETHER THIS MONEY ACCOMPLISHED ITS PURPOSE BY THE TIME OF THE MAY REVISE. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY CORRECT BUT UNFORTUNATE. BUT I APPRECIATE THAT. SO ARE THERE ANY MORE QUESTIONS HERE. THEN ONCE YOU TURN YOUR MICROPHONE AND ASK YOUR PHONE SO JUST- SO JUST CONNECT ADDRESSES JUST MOVING FORWARD IN THIS COMEY SYMONETTE I'M HERE NEXT YEAR BUT STILL LOOKING AT. FOLLOWING UP WHETHER OR NOT. THEY WERE COMPLIANT OR NOT THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US TO FOLLOW UP NEXT YEAR YES AND I THINK WHAT I'M GOING TO. TAKE THE RISK OF ANSWERING THE QUESTION SO THE THING ABOUT IT IS THAT WILL BE EVIDENT IN THE FALL OF BY THE TIME WE- WE HAVE THIS HEARING NEXT YEAR IT SHOULD BE SHOULD BE ANOTHER. THE N. ACTUALLY COURSE THE COMMITTEE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE IT. IF IT COMES IN IN THE FALL BEFORE WE START MEETING AGAIN BUT- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT. THEN LET ME THANK YOU AND MAKE THE COMMENT AGAIN THAT FOR THOSE THAT ARE WATCHING AT HOME THAT THIS WAS AS MUCH ABOUT OVERSIGHT AND HAVING THE REPORTERS ABOUT THE SPECIFIC QUESTION SO. WILL MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER TWELVE. WHICH IS THE DREAMER SERVICE INCENTIVE FOR GRANTED THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND WE HAVE ON THE PANEL. GABRIELA CHAVEZ FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JERRY BREMNER FROM THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION. AND LISA CAME FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE WILL START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE MORNING W. LIKE CH√ÅVEZ BUT THAT OF FINANCE- ONE SECOND I'M HAVING SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES HERE. HOW THE COMPANY'S BY DID TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO MODIFY THE COCHRAN BE TREMENDOUS SERVICE INTENDED GROUND PROGRAM TO INCREASE PARTICIPANTS BY BANDS FROM THE QUIBBLING OF TEN DOLLARS OUT WAGE SO THEY QUIT IN OFFICE NON AN HOUR WAGE. AND ALLOW ANY AND IT'S- AND IT ANY EXPENSE FUNDS. TO BE PROVIDED TO THE UC. NCO TO SUPPORT THAT. DREAM NONPROFIT. THANK AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MY ON TO MISTER BURN FROM THE CALIFORNIA STOOD NAY COMMISSION. GOOD MORNING LAYERED AND OKAY ABOVE GOOD TO BE BACK WITH YOU- MISTER COMMISSION IS VERY. FOR ALL. TO THIS SERVICE INSIDE OF HER PROGRAM AND HELP OUR- CALIFORNIA DREAMIN FILER. MOST OF ARE UNDER AND PROVIDE DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO THE COMMUNITY SERVICE THAT THEY UNDERTAKE THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. WE'RE ALSO APPRECIATIVE OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S- BUDGET TO HELP ADDRESS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE HEARD CONSISTENTLY FROM OUR CAMPUS PARTNERS IN THIS FIRST YEAR TREATMENT PLANTATION OF THIS PROGRAM. AROUND THE- THE AMOUNT OF THE FINANCIALLY THAT'S PROVIDED TO STUDENTS AND IN RETURN FOR THE COMPLETION OF THEIR SERVICE HOURS. AND START TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE L. A. R. WAS PROVIDED IN THEIR ANALYSIS BUT I SUSPECT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ILLEGAL SPEECH JUST A MOMENT WE AGREED WITH THE RECOMMENDATION THAT THERE SHOULD BE A FOR THE REVISION OF THE STATUTORY PROVISIONS. AROUND THE REDUCTION OF AWARDS FOR PART TIME ENROLLED STUDENTS MRS BEEN ANOTHER CONSISTENT POINT OF FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR CAMPUS PARTNERS DOES THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO BRING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO- STUDENTS WHO MAY BE ELIGIBLE IN OUR CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT FILERS. AND THEN FINALLY WALL WE JUST TO MAKE COMMISSION DON'T HAVE DATA ON THE DREAM LOAN PROGRAM THAT IS ADMINISTERED BY UC AND CSU CAMPUSES- I DID JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE FACTORS THE DAILY AS- UPLIFTED IN THEIR ANALYSIS AROUND. THE PARTICIPATION RATES IN BETWEEN ONE PROGRAMS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS MAY SHIFT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS AS WE SEE A RETURN TO ON CAMPUS LIVING STATUS FOR STUDENTS. WHO HAVE BEEN AT HOME AND DISTANCE LEARNING DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND WE ALSO ANTICIPATE THERE WILL NOT BE THE SAME LEVEL OF INVESTMENT AND EMERGENCY FINANCIAL AID- THAT CAME ABOUT AS A RESULT OF COKE IN NINETEEN. I'M AND IT'S BEEN VERY LIKELY OFFSETTING- BUT- DREAMLAND. THAT THESE MIGHT. WE'RE ON WE KNOW THAT UNDOCKED STUDENTS FOR. DREAM FILER BASIS DEEPER. AFFORDABILITY THAN PEERS BECAUSE OF THEIR LACK ELEGY. FOR FINANCIAL AID AND THE- ONE PER HAS BEEN A REALLY IMPORTANT TO HELP FILL THAT GAP. AND ENSURE THAT THEIR FINANCIAL AID PACKAGES CAN BE. OFFSET FOR THAT LACK OF FEDERAL GRANT AID OR EVEN FEDERAL SUBSIDIZED LOANS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WILL MOVE TO. A LISA CAME FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU FOR COMING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I SHED TEARS ACTUALLY TWO COMPONENTS THAT THIS PROPOSAL ONE THAT WOULD INCREASE THE AWARD AMOUNT IN THE TRAVERSE FROM CENTCOM PROGRAM AND ANOTHER THAT WAY BE CORRECT ANY UNSPENT FUNDS FROM PROGRAM. THREE MONTH. REGARDING POSTING IN AWARENESS REASON WAY HER PARKING. IN A THAT'S VERY AFTER SO. FOR TAKE BY PROVIDING THE- TO FIFTY DOLLARS HOUR TO STUDENTS PER. AS PROGRAM WE THINK THAT WOULD ALLOW THE PROBE TO. THE STUDENTS AT A RATE THAT'S MORE SIMILAR TO WHAT THE WOULD RECEIVE THROUGH OTHER OF WORK. DR THIS PROPOSAL THAT WHEN THE MARKET. I THE COMMISSION PREVIOUSLY. UNDER THE GOVERNOR PROPOSAL TIME STUDENTS BUT STILL RECEIVE PRO RATED. MEANING THAT A STUDENT HAVE TO RECEIVE GIFTS OF AND KIND OF AND FIFTY OUT IN DEFENSE PER HOUR SERVICE. WE THINK THE BEST WAY TO LIKELY TO LOADING HER CART STUDENTS PARTICIPATE THE PROGRAM AND MOREOVER WE SEE AS RATION FOR. PART KINDS AT A LOW HOURLY RATE THEIR SERVICE AND FULL TIME HOUSE FOR PARKS STUDENTS. ONE OF THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE INTERPRETER TWENTY. FOR JUST INSTEAD OF CASTING LINES. YOU SEEN IF YOU'RE RENTING TWICE IN THE CURRENT FUNDING LAW FOR THIS MEET. AT THIS TIME IS. I HAVING TO. WAY LESSER STUDENTS AWAY FROM THE PROGRAM. IN THE BASED ON A AND- WE SEEN A DEMONSTRATE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND. NOT REASON WE RECOMMEND REJECT SERVICES OF GRAN. DIFFERENT ONES ON HE THE SERVICES OF PARENT. THE LEGISLATURE MADE TO RE ON FUNDING LEVEL CAN PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT IT'S A LINE DEMAND AND THAT THERE ARE MAKES I'M TIME IN THIS PROGRAM AND EACH YEAR. AND YOU'RE SEEING DONALD PAGE SEVEN THAT WE RECOGNIZE- HARM ANDTO COMPLY IS JUST. MAYBE THAT ALL OF YOU OF KNOWLEDGE THAT THAT'S AN ISSUE AND A GOOD KNOWLEDGE THAT SOME OF THE PROPOSALS THIS YEAR OR DECIDE TO ADDRESS IT SO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. THAT OUR HOPE IS TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE THAT. ARE WOULD BE SUPPORT OF AND THEN. WE CAN. MAKE AN ASSESSMENT PROVIDED THOSE ARE APPROVED IN. WHETHER THAT DID IN FACT AFFECT THE PARTICIPATION RATE BECAUSE WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE HUNTER. YES SENATOR JOB. YOU ANY. I DO- AND THIS IS. FOR- I SEE. WHAT IS CLEAR THAT THE YOU SEE IN THE C. YEAR CAN YOU PER THE BY OF THE. TWO FOR. I'M NOT SURE THAT. QUESTIONS. BECAUSE HE SEEMS HE HAS HONOR I DON'T HAVE THE DATA READILY AVAILABLE BY THE. AS REQUIRED ON THE BALANCE OF THEIR DREAMLAND AND IN THEIR USUALLY- ARE QUITE AND SO I COULD FOLLOW WITH YOUR STAFF TO THAT INFORMATION AFTER THE HEARING. AND WE DO ALSO HAVE SOME THAT YOU SEE ESTIMATED ON THE BALLOT SNATCHING PER. I THINK THE I OF THE TO TWENTY. ONE I'M AND IT I RECALL THE BALLOTS WERE QUITE HIGHWAYS SEVERAL TIMES AND WILL SPAN AND I HERE. MARCH AND- THANK YOU TO THE PANEL. WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO OUR LAST ITEM WHICH IS ISSUE THIRTEEN WHICH IS OVERSIGHT ON FOOD NAY- PIECES OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BUDGET ACT IN OUR ONE PANELIST IS CHECK FROM HER FROM THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SURE LAYERED AND I AM I AM PLEASED TO JOIN YOU TODAY TO PROVIDE THESE UPDATES ON- THREE PROGRAMS THAT COLLECTIVELY REPRESENTED ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET AGREEMENT- OUTLINES AND WAS PART OF REALLY WHAT WAS A HISTORIC YEAR IN THE STATE'S INVESTMENT AND FINANCIAL AID IN PROMOTING COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. YOU HEARD FROM ME EARLIER THIS MONTH ABOUT OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CALTRAIN EXPANSION AND WHERE WE ARE IN DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE REVISED MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. THESE THREE PROGRAMS REFLECT MORE TARGETED EFFORTS THAT SERVE A SPECIFIC POPULATIONS IN ADDITION TO YOUR OUTSIDE OF THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS WILL CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. SO ALL START WITH A FEW UPDATES ON THE LEARNING ALIGNED IMPLEMENT PROGRAM WHICH- AS YOUR AGENDA MATERIALS REFLECT- HAD AN APPROPRIATION OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND THE TWENTY ONE BUDGET AND A PROPOSED INVESTMENT OF ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING. AND THIS YEAR'S PROPOSED BUDGET FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND I'M FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROVIDING OUR PUBLIC COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES WITH FUNDS TO CREATE LEARNING A LINE DEPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AS THE NAME WOULD SUGGEST. THAT WOULD PROVIDE UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN EXPERIENCE IN THEIR FIELD OF STUDY OR- THERE ARE FIELD OF% CAREER INTERESTS. THE ROLE FOR THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND THIS PROGRAM IS TO WORK WITH OUR CAMPUS PARTNERS AND DEVELOP A PROGRAM GUIDELINES. THIS YEAR AS THE BUDGET AGREEMENT REFLECTED LAST YEAR THIS YEAR WAS INTENDED FOR- PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT OF GUIDELINES SO THAT IN THE NEXT ACADEMIC YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ACADEMIC YEAR STUDENTS CAN START TO ACTUALLY ACCESS THESE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. MR NATE COMMISSION HAS FORMED A WORKGROUP WITH OUR CAMPUS AND STATEMENT PARTNERS HELP ADVISE US ON WHAT THIS PROGRAM GUIDELINES SHOULD LOOK LIKE AND WORK THROUGH A QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE ALREADY HEARING ABOUT FROM THOSE CAMPUS PARTNERS AND ANTICIPATE HEARING MORE ABOUT AS THIS ROLLS OUT. THIS GROUP IS CURRENTLY MEETING WEEKLY- AND WERE- LOOKING TOWARDS THE END ISSUE ALL RELEASED OF THE PROGRAM- IN THE NEXT- MONTH OR SO. IT WOULD THAT AND- I'LL INTO PER. SIGN ON TO THAT AGREE. BEFORE THE END THIS YEAR. SO THAT THE STUDENTS COMMISSION COULD AWARD- CHIU FOR TWO. CAMPUS THERE SURE FUNDS BASED ON NUMBER OF HEALTH TO. THAT ARE SERVED BY THAT CAN. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT IF PROBABLY THIS IS THE- HURDLE OR THE MOST. FOR A WITH THIS. IS THE- FOR. OUR CAMPUS PARTNERS WHO WE ARE TASKED CREE DOES AND ALL. ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS WITH- EITHER ON CAMPUS OR OFF CAMPUS EMPLOYERS AND THAT AND THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM WE BELIEVE WILL REALLY BE CONTINGENT ON HOW THOSE CAMPUS ENTITIES ARE FINANCIAL AID OFFICES CAN WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH OUR CAMPUS CAREER CENTERS ON HOW THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. IN SUPPORT ALL THAT WORK WE'RE ALSO MINDFUL THAT THERE IS A NEED TO BE PROACTIVE IN CONTACTING EMPLOYER PARTNERS SO THIS DO YOU NEED COMMISSION IS WORKING TO FIND MEANS TO WHICH WE CAN HELP FACILITATE. CAMPUS AN. EMPLOYER CONNECTIONS FROM OUR SIDE AS WELL. ALL NOW TRANSITION TO THE NEXT PROGRAM HERE WHICH IS THE GOLDEN STATE- TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM- THIS IS A MISTER BERMAN OR AYE- FOR BE IT FROM ME TO INTERRUPT BUT- WE ARE TRYING TO END THIS HEARING BY ELEVEN THIRTY. OR SO AND WE START TO TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT SO IF THERE IS ANY. BREVITY IN THESE TWO ITEMS ARE PERSIUS. I WILL KEEP IT CONCISE- CHAIR. SO- WITH THE GOLD DAY TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM WE WERE ALREADY IMPLEMENTING. PRIOR TO THE TWENTY ONE BUDGET AGREEMENT. AND THIS WAS A MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD PROGRAM FIRST INITIATED BECAUSE IT WAS AN EXPANSION OF AN EXISTING PROGRAM TO HELP STUDENTS ENTERING. TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS I MEAN WHO COMMIT TO SERVING AT A HIGH. PRIORITY SCHOOL WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF ON YOU PEOPLE CREATED A STUDENTS WHO COMMITTED TEACHING IN HIGH HERTY FIELD. THIS PROVIDES THEM WITH THE GRANT OF UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TOWARD THE COST FOR THAT TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM. WE ARE ALREADY PROCESSING APPLICATIONS AND AWARDING FUNDS TO STUDENTS SO FAR WE'VE RECEIVED OVER TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED. APPLICATIONS FROM STUDENTS AND JUST THIS YEAR- AND WE HAVE DATA THAT WE CAN SHARE ON THE NUMBER OF DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN AWARDED AS FAR. AND HOW THOSE APPLICATIONS BREAK OUT BY THE TYPE OF PROGRAM IN WHICH THE STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THE SUBJECT AREA. THAT THEY WORK ON TO PURSUE. INSTRUCTION AND THEN I'LL JUST- OUT FOR THE SAKE OF BREVITY YOUR THE OTHER. THIRD PROGRAM. I HAVE A MILLION APPROPRIATION FROM LAST YEAR'S BUT- I'M TOWARD THE GOAL STATE AND TRAINING FOR PROGRAM. THIS IS THE PROBE THAT PER. IN WHAT LAW WORK A RESULT OF THE CODE NINETEEN. CAN DAMAGE WITH UP TO TWENTY HUNDRED GRANT TO OUR- AND EDUCATION PROGRAM AT ONE OF OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS OR- CHIU AND ENTER INTO A TRAINING PROGRAM. FROM A PROVIDER ON THE ELIGIBLE TRAINING PROVIDERS LIST THAT NEEDS DEFINED CRITERIA- IN THE STATUTE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED AROUND THIS PROGRAM- WE'VE BEEN CONSULTING WITH NOT ONLY OUR USUAL SUSPECTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION AROUND THIS PROGRAM BUT ALSO WITH. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT LEADERS GIVEN THE TRAINING COMPONENT OF THIS PROGRAM AND WE'VE ALSO SOLICITED EXPERTISE FROM OUTSIDE OF THE STATE. FROM OTHER ENTITIES THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED SIMILAR. PROGRAMS WHAT WE'VE HEARD VERY CLEARLY FROM ALL OF THOSE PARTNERS IS REALLY THE NEED TO BE MINDFUL ABOUT. HOW WE ROLL THIS OUT AND HOW WE CAN PHASE AND THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM KNOWING THAT THE VOLUME OF APPLICATIONS RECEIVED FOR OTHER PROGRAMS OF THIS KIND HAS. REALLY OVERWHELMED CAPACITY AT TIMES. I'M SO WHAT WE'RE- DOING WITH THIS PROGRAM IS REALLY AN INTENTIONAL ROLLOUT TO A PILOT. PROGRAM WE ARE FORCED BURNING. STUDENT PARENTS WHO ARE ENROLLED ONE OUR PUBLIC. ARE GONNA- ABSENT OR NEVER. EDUCATION SINCE THEY LOST WORK DUE TO GOOD NOW. I'M AND RW THE MOST. STUDENTS THAT WE CAN TARGET AND BACKED APPLY. AND SUPPLE AND- OF THEIR FINE. AID APPLICATION DATA. WILL THEN SHIFT TO START TO SERVICE PARENTS WERE IN OTHER FINANCED- PROGRAMS THAT OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS THAT MAY NOT QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL AID. AND THEN EVENTUALLY IN THE LAST STEP OF THE PILOT PERIOD START TO SERVE- INDIVIDUALS WE'RE ENTERING PROGRAMS- TO THE HIGH ROAD TRAINING PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. OF BEDS- IMPLEMENTED BY THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS BEFORE WE FINALLY DO THE FULL ROLLOUT TO ALL INDIVIDUALS. WHO QUALIFY FOR THIS PROGRAM AND MAY BE SEEKING TO ENTER A TRAINER PARTNERSHIP. A TRAINING OR EDUCATION PROGRAM- AND ALL FINALLY OLDEST NOTED WE EXPECT THIS FIRST WAVE. OF INVITATIONS FOR A LIKELY ELIGIBLE STUDENTS TO APPLY WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WE'RE JUST FINALIZING THOSE MATERIALS AND I'VE BEEN SHARING WITH OUR CAMPUS PARTNERS WHAT THEY SHOULD LOOK OUT FOR AND EXPECT. AS WE START TO YOU. FOR STUDENTS ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU FOR MUCH IN AND LET ME SAY THE- WE DID HAVE A SEPARATE STUDENT AID THE COMMISSION HEARING. SOME OF THESE TO THE SIDE CAME UP IN THAT. AND I DON'T WANT TO DISCOUNT THE FACT THAT WE'RE SHORT ON TIME FOR THE FACT THAT. THESE WERE SIGNIFICANT PROGRAMS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND THAT WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN HOW THEY'RE BEING IMPLEMENTED AND MAKING SURE. THAT THE MONEY THAT WAS APPROPRIATED GOES TO THE PURPOSE OF ONCE SO LET ME JUST SAY I APPRECIATE YOUR- OUR COMMENTS AND WE JUST LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED- INFORMATION. ON THE SUCCESS OF THESE AND I DID NOTE ONE. THAT YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE ED AND MAKING IT A PILOT BECAUSE OF THE CHANCE TO IMPLEMENT IT SO WE'LL JUST CONTINUE TO WANT TO HEAR THOSE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US TODAY- WHAT WE HAVE A VERY LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME BUT- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE PUBLIC COMMENTS SECTION.
