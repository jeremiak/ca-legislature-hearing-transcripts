THE STATE OF HATE THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING AND I'M ASSEMBLYMEMBER RICHARD BLOOM. AND AM HONORED TO SERVE AS CHAIR OF THIS VERY IMPORTANT SELECT COMMITTEE. THIS EVENING OUR TOPIC IS THE CHANGING FACE OF EXTREMISM. SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN WITH HELD SEVERAL HEARINGS AND EVENTS ON THE CURRENT STATE OF HATE WITH DIFFERENT POINTS OF FOCUS AT EACH HEARING. ALTHOUGH WE'VE COVERED DIFFERENT TOPICS OVER THE YEARS A COMMON THREAD REMAINS HATE CRIMES AND OTHER FORMS OF TARGETED VIOLENCE SEEM ONLY TO BE TRENDING UPWARD. I'M SAD TO REPORT THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE WAS THE WORST YEAR OVERALL FOR HATE CRIMES SINCE.TWO THOUSAND ONE. OUR BIGGEST CONCERNS ARE SHARED BY AB HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY LEADING EXPERTS IN THE FIELD. SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A RISE IN LOAN ACTORS THAT COMMIT VIOLENT ACTS THAT SUBSCRIBE TO WHITE NATIONALIST IDEOLOGY BUT WHO ARE NOT NECESSARILY ACTING ON BEHALF OF A PARTICULAR GROUP. THERE'S ALSO THE PROBLEM OF POLITICAL REGIONALIZATION. WE HAVE HOT BUTTON LARGE SCALE ISSUES THAT ARE PLAYING OUT AT LOCAL LEVELS WHERE THEY HAVEN'T BEFORE. WE THINK TARGETED VIOLENCE AND AGGRESSION BEYOND TRADITIONAL HATE CRIME TARGETS PEOPLE X. GOT LIKE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ELECTED OFFICIALS AND OTHER CIVIL SERVANTS. ADDITIONALLY THE CONCERNED ABOUT THE INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TARGETED AGGRESSION AND VIOLENCE SOCIAL MEDIA AND FREE SPEECH IS QUICKLY GROWING. OVER THE YEARS WE'VE HOSTED THESE HEARINGS ONE THING BECAME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR. WE NEED A PERMANENT STATEWIDE CENTRALIZED BODY NOT UNLIKE THE SELECT COMMITTEE TO TRACK AND MONITOR HATE CRIMES TRENDS AND TO RECOMMEND POLICY SOLUTIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO I'M GRATEFUL THAT THIS PAST OCTOBER GOVERNOR NEWSOM SIGNED ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN TWENTY SIX WHICH WAS MY LEGISLATION THAT FORMALLY ESTABLISHES A PERMANENT COMMISSION ON THE STATE OF HATE SOMETHING OF WHICH I AM SO PROUD AND IN THE MONTHS TO COME THAT COMMISSION WILL. FORM AND THE MEMBERS WILL BE APPOINTED TO IT AND ULTIMATELY BEGIN TO HOLD HEARINGS. BUT UNTIL THAT TAKES PLACE THE SELECT COMMITTEE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THIS MUCH NEEDED WORK. WE HAVE A FULL PROGRAM AHEAD OF US THIS EVENING SO- JUST BEFORE WE GET STARTED I'M GOING TO TURN THE MIKE OVER TO MY GOOD FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE MIGUEL SANTIAGO. WHO IS GOING TO WELCOME US INTO HIS DISTRICT WHERE WE ARE HOSTING THE HEARING THIS EVENING AND AFTER THAT YOU'LL HEAR FROM MY OTHER GOOD FRIEND WHO'S HERE THIS EVENING- ASSEMBLER ASSEMBLY MEMBER ELOISE RAMOS- WHO SERVED ON THE COMMITTEE ALONG. WITH MYSELF AND OTHERS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM AND MISS- MAJORITY LEADER REYES FOR COMING DOWN TO THE DISTRICT AND HOSTED A PART OF AN ANTI WHITE WHY IT'S TIMELY AND- WHAT'S IMPORTANT THAT- YOU RECOGNIZED AND HOSTED IN IN. OUR DISTRICT BECAUSE- MOST OF YOU KNOW THAT DURING THE LAST SUMMER WE SAW SOME OF THE MOST- HORRIFIC ACTS- AND I CALLED OF VIOLENCE EVEN THOUGH FROM A MOVE OR VERBAL AS IT RELATES TO. AP I HATE. YOU KNOW OR WE SAW. IN THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT HAS LITTLE TOKYO AND CAREER COUNT. AT WE SAW- WE THOUGHT EVERYTHING FROM FLOWERS- BEING SAID. TO A KOREAN SENIORS WERE WALKING ON THE STREET TWO. BOTTLES OR OR SODA- PHILIPPINE THROWN- WE SAW SOME VIOLENCE WITH THEM HITTING AND THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INCIDENTS AND A CRIME I RECOGNIZE- BUT NEVER DID WE EVER THINK THAT AFTER. ALL WE'VE GONE. IN CALIFORNIA IN PARTICULAR LOS FANS OF HER PROGRESS A LOT HINGES COULD SEE SOMETHING. LIKE WHAT WE SAW HERE RIGHT IN OUR OWN BACKYARD. AND IT'S WITH HEARTFELT- PAYMENT RELEASE THAT I HAD FIT WE SAW THIS ALL ACROSS LOS ANGELES OR- EVEN IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE REPORTS- RECENTLY WERE LOS ANGELES. CITY IS WHERE MOST OF THE- EIGHT- AXE AND CRIME HAPPENED- AND IT'S DISHEARTENING BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW THAT WE'VE GONE A LOT THAT WE MOVED A LOT FOR- IN THIS AREA- WE FOUND A LOT BEHIND- AT THE SAME TIME. AND ARE AREAS FELT THE GUN DEBATE. I MEAN I DON'T KNOW HOW OFF THE FACE A. N. N. AND IT WASN'T JUST ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE SAYING IT BECAUSE WE THOUGHT PEOPLE FROM OUR OWN CULTURE AS WELL WE'VE GOT ONLY AND WE DID IT'S PAINFUL TO HAVE TO SAY BUT IT'S- BUT IT'S TRUE. WHAT WE SAW IN ONE INSTANCE A AND IT WAS WELL DOCUMENTED WERE- API WOMAN WAS ORDERING FOOD. AND WAS BE RATED. AND VIOLENTLY YELLED AT- ALMOST PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED WHILE ENTIRE RESTAURANT- ITS EMPLOYEES AND ITS MANAGER SAT THERE AND JUST WATCH THAT HAPPENED NOT TOO FAR AWAY FROM HERE. YOUR WE THOUGHT A GENTLEMAN- BEAT UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET. WHERE WE SAW. OVER AND OVER- VERBALLY ABUSED OR PHYSICALLY ABUSED- I'VE I CAN'T EVEN I BELIEVE THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION TODAY TO BE FRANK WITH YOU I MEAN I THAT WE EEL LIKE WE'VE GONE SO FAR YET WE HAVEN'T GONE THAT FAR WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT- ART. DISTRICT TOOK ACTION AND IT WASN'T. IT WAS A GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT REALLY WRE WE JOIN THE MOVEMENT WITH AT LEAST IT WOULD JOIN THE MOVEMENT OF BOTH ALL THE WAY FROM KOREATOWN TO LITTLE TOKYO IN AND MARCHING AND CALLING TO ACTION IN AND GRASSROOTS ORGANIZING NONPROFIT ORGANIZING IN CARAVANS UP AND DOWN TRYING TO SHUT THE ALARM OF WHAT WE'VE LEARNED- AT A VERY BASIC CHORDS THAT YOU CAN'T TOLERATE IT AT ANY LEVEL AND YOU CAN'T TOLERATE IT NO MATTER WHAT THE AGES WHETHER A KID IS. FIVE YEARS OF AGE OR EIGHTEEN OR FORTY FIVE YOU CALL IT OUT FOR WHAT IT IS- AND YOU STOP IT WERE ATTACKED N. YOU CAN'T STAND TO BE AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER- WHAT WE FOUND VERY EFFECTIVE. IS THAT WOULD YOU MAKE IT NOT COOL WHEN YOU CALLED OUT FOR WHAT IT IS WHEN YOU SEE SOMEBODY DOING IT THAT SOMEONE ACROSS THE STREET. AND YOU WALK ACROSS THE STREET ENJOYING THAT PERSON IS SOLITARY. IT DOES HELP. AND I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS- THAT WHILE WE PUSH FOR ALL THE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES AND WE SHOULD AND WHY WE PUSH FOR THE BUDGET. I THAT WE HAVE IN IN THERE WAS A PIECE- THAT FUNDED- STOP API- WHICH WAS- WHAT WHICH IS FUNDED THROUGH UCLA THAT THE PROGRAM THAT I KNOW. YOU WORKED ON IN THIS REYES WORKED ON WILL PUSH VERY HARD TO DO WHICH COLLECTS THE DATA THEN THEN QUANTIFIES OUR ABILITY TO SAY THIS IS REALLY A PROBLEM WE KNOW THE PUMP IT'S GOT QUALIFIED IN DATA. AND WE KNOW THAT FOR EVERY PER THING THAT IS REPORTED. THERE ARE LOTS. MORE THAT WERE NOT. I THINK WHAT WHAT WHAT- WHAT WE LEARNED IS IT IS WE'VE GOT A JOINT FOLLOWED AND CALLED OUT FOR WHAT IT IS WHEN IT HAPPENS YOU CAN BE AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER AND THAT THAT HAS BEEN THE LARGEST- I THINK. ONE OF THE LARGEST MOVEMENT TO SUPPRESSION TO THAT SORT OF HATE. IS THAT WOULD YOU SEE IT HAPPEN YOU HAVE TO CALL IT OUT YET THE SHEEN YOU HAVE TO STOP IT NO MATTER WHO IT IS. NO MATTER WHETHER IT'S- YOUR OWN OR SOMEBODY WHO YOU LOVE YOU JUST HAVE TO STOP. AND IT GOES A LONG WAYS TO DO SO. AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S WHEN THE RUBBER HITS THE ROAD IT'S EITHER TYPE OF ACTIONS. THE PEOPLE FEET TOWARD AND IF. IT WOULD RESULT IN ITS REAL MOVEMENT IT'S REAL STOPPING- THIS HORRIBLE DIEASE OF HATE THAT WE'VE NOW SEEN IN OUR STATE. THANK YOU FOR DOING IF I. A LITTLE LONGER THAN I WANTED TO BUT BUT I BUT IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THINK THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WILL HEAR FROM MAJORITY LEADER RAMOS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION. IT'S BEEN A PRIVILEGE TO SERVE. WITH OUR CHAIRMAN ASSEMBLYMEMBER RICHARD BLOOM.

THIS IS A HORRIBLE DISEASE OF HATE THIS IS NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT CAN EXIST AND IT'S GOING TO GO AWAY IT IS A DISEASE WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DIAGNOSE IT AND BE ABLE TO FIND WAYS TO REACH.

AND ABLE TO THE THINGS WERE TRANSNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE FOR MORE THAN TWO DECADES I'VE BEEN RESEARCHING AND PUBLISHING ON THE FAR RIGHT AND OTHER FORMS OF EXTREMIST ACTIVITY AND I LIKE THE FEELING HE'S TODAY ABOUT THE CHANGING NATURE OF HATE NEW S. TO SYMBOLIZE FEW YEARS AND THROUGH THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. YOU KNOW WE HAVE WITNESSED TERRIBLE TERRORIST ATTACKS IN RECENT YEARS WRITING HATE CRIMES AS I SAID DR LET ME JUST TALK ABOUT. RAPIDLY CHANGING IN RECENT YEARS USING THE RISE OF NEW TYPES OF THREATS VIOLENCE INSPIRING CONSPIRACY MOVEMENTS A BURGEONING H. GOVERNMENT PARAMILITARY MOVEMENT THIS AND RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSIDERABLE VIOLENCE AND IT BECOME INCREASINGLY ANTI IMMIGRANT NEEDS MOSLEM. SO STARTING AROUND TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN THIS IS A PICTURE OF THE STERILIZED SYNAGOGUE IN PITTSBURGH THAT IS ON THE WAY BUT WHEN ACTORS ATTACKS BEGAN TO PICK UP COURSE THERE WAS A DIFFERENT TACK AS WELL IT HOW A CALIFORNIA. BUT AND WE HAD A SERIES OF THESE HIGH DEMANDS THE L. PASO WALMART'S UNITS TIMELINE AND THEY'RE OFTEN ARE ATTACKS ON JEWS OR MUSLIMS AND MOTIVATED BY THE RADIOLOGY THE GREAT REPLACEMENT THIS IDEA THAT WHITE AMERICANS ARE SOMEHOW BEING FORCIBLY REPLACED USUALLY THE HANDS OF A JURY CONSPIRACY. BY MUSLIMS REFUGEES HAD OTHER IMMIGRANTS I THIS IS JUST AN AMERICAN PROBLEM THE SAME KINDS OF ATTACHED WITH A BY THE SAME IDEAS THAT HAPPENING WORLDWIDE ACTUALLY THE CHRISTCHURCH NEW ZEALAND MARCH SHOOTINGS WERE DRIVEN BY THE SAME IDEAS. SO THOSE TWO WERE A COUPLE OF TAX IN GERMANY'S IS A WORLDWIDE PROBLEM AT THIS PARTICULAR WHITE SUPREMACIST THINKING THIS RIGHT REPLACING THE CONSPIRACY THEORY EXTENT ENTERING INTO MAIN MAINSTREAM CIRCLES. WE ALSO HAD RISE ANOTHER MOVEMENT THAT IS INVOLVED IN A LOT OF LOAN AFTER VIOLENCE SO CALLED INCEL MOVEMENT OR FOR A VOLUNTARILY CELIBATE THIS IS A MISOGYNISTIC MOVEMENT AND AVAILABLE TOOLS TAX ON WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES DEADLY ATTACKS. IN THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS ABROAD BY PEOPLE. MOTIVATED BY THESE IDEAS. SO IT LOGICAL LOW AFTER RILEY THAT IS A- WE HAVE HAD AT THE SAME TIME AS WELL ONE OF THE FEW GROWING THESE ARE HAPPENING HEY CRIMES. IS A DOCTOR TO TALK ABOUT WE A RISE CONSIDERS YOU- IN A WAY IT HAS BEEN THE CASE IN THE- THIS. AND HE IS A WENT ON A TEAR THIS SORT OF MUNI VERY BELIEVES THAT. DEMOCRATS AND- STAR OR TRY YOU KNOW GET ANY THE CHILD TRAPPED. THIS THIS MOVE WHICH IS OUT IS. INSPIRING BY THE FBI DIDN'T EVEN EXIST UNTIL TWENTY SIXTEEN AT THIS POINT IN THE MOVEMENT OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE SPREAD ACROSS THE INTERNET IN OTHER COUNTRIES AS FAR AWAY AS JAPAN. AND IS EMBLEMATIC OF HOW THE WAITED WEB FUNCTIONS HAS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED HOUSING IS IDEAS AND PROBABLY HAVE ALL SORTS NOT IT IS WISE TO REMEMBER THIS IS A CONSPIRACY STYLE. CAN SPREAD. AND BECOME A RECRUITING TOOL AND RADICALIZED LOTS AND LOTS OF PEOPLE AGED EXTREMIST MOVEMENTS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS CONCERNING HERE'S WERE FIGHTING IN THE IRAQI CIRCLES IN A VERY VERY YOUNG KIDS. THIRTEEN FOURTEEN YEARS OLD ARE. GETTING SUCKED INTO THESE WORLDS. I THERE- OTHER USERS HERE OF COURSE ALONG WITH YOU ONSITE. A TELLS AND PAST AROUND THE BACK. AROUND THE FAIR OF OUR- AND IN A VERY. OTHER SIMILAR. AND ALL WHICH YOU LEAD TO SERIOUS REAL WORLD KIND OF THE DRIVERS OF DRAFT. HATE CRIMES AND OTHER PROBLEMS. SO I JUST. CHAU HERE- SO DATA FROM CENTER FOR DISEASE AND STUDIES THAT MAKES THE POINT THAT THE GENERAL TERRORIST ATTACKS THE DEBATE HAPPENING RECENTLY AT THE TAIL END OF THIS IS TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY HAVE LARGELY COMING FROM THE VIOLENT FAR RIGHT BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY ALSO BETTER THE HOBBIT COMING FROM THE FAR LEFT WE JUST ROUTE AT INTERNATIONAL CRUISE BUT REALLY IN RECENT YEARS OUR BIG PROBLEM HAS BEEN. FAR RIGHT EXTREMISTS. YOUR WORK. FOR TWENTY YEARS THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER AND ONE OF MY- RESPONSIBILITIES WAS PRODUCING THE SPLC'S. HATE MAP. AN INTERESTING INCIDENT HAPPENING IN TERMS OF HATE GROUPS THESE ARE GROUPS THAT- HAPPY HOLIDAYS EXPRESS. SHIP OR OTHER WEBSITES TO DENIGRATES WHOLE OTHER CLASSES OF PEOPLE SO THE LITTLE FOR EXAMPLE ALL JEWS ALL BLACK AND SO ON ONE OF THE TRENDS THAT WE'RE SEEING IT IS THE NUMBER OF HATE GROUPS IS ACTUALLY STARTING TO FALL OFF. BECAUSE THESE MOVEMENTS ARE BECOMING NETWORKS NOT ORGANIZATIONS THERE ARE MOVING ONLINE AND PEOPLE AREN'T NECESSARILY GOING TO BE HARD DURING THAT ORGANIZATIONS. IN THE FUTURE. AB YOU EVERYTHING'S HAPPEN IN THE ON SAY. AND IT IS ALL APPEALING I MEAN JUST LOOK ACT BROKEN OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TO THE IDEA OF THE STATE. WHEN APRIL ARMIES READING TACK PLATFORMS WHICH IS BECOME SOMEWHAT LESS THE CASE IN RECENT YEARS IS PLACES LIKE FACEBOOK AND TWITTER AT HANSON D. PLATFORMING THE WHITE SUPREMACISTS. IN CANCERS ZERO. SO JUST IN A LOT COUPLE YEARS AND SEEN. NUDE MOVEMENTS COME OUT OF NOWHERE ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE BLUE VOICE MOVEMENT. IF IT IS NOT EXACTLY A HIGHLY ORGANIZED SET OF PEOPLE THEIR CELEBRATIONS SAY AIMS TO SORT OF BRING THE END OF OUR DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. AND IT INVOLVES AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE- BUT KEY MEMBERS OF THE LITTLE BOYS KILLED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN OPEN IN TWENTY TWENTY. THEY'RE TEMPTED TO BOMBER- SOCIAL JUSTICE MOVEMENTS LAPLAND MATTER PROTESTS IN LAS VEGAS AND WERE PAINFULLY HIGH BUT THEY'RE ALSO CONNECTED TO A LOT OF VIOLENCE OR OTHER EXPLORATIONS GROUPS. THAT ARE RELATIVELY NEW IN TERMS OF WHAT ANYONE FORMED GROUPS LIKE THE BASE WHICH IS. AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF ARCADIA SO IT WILL BE SEEN AS A KIND OF QUICKLY FORMING NEW TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS IN THE ACT RIGHT WING EXTREMISTS AND WHITE SUPREMACISTS FAITH. AND A LOT OF. VIOLENCE CONNECTED TO THOSE GROUPS. THIS ANOTHER EXAM OF A WORKING TERMS CARE ATTACK BUT NOW ALL IN TWENTY. AND YOU WILL SEE HOW. THE VICE OR RIGHT HAS HAS SPIKED DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME. A LOT OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH REACTION AMONG THE FAR RIGHT TO THE BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTS THERE WERE ALL KINDS OF TERRIBLE THINGS. PERPETRATED BY RIGHT WING EXTREMISTS LIKE CAR TAX DURING THOSE EVENTS NOT JUST ABOUT THE ATTEMPTED BOMBING THAT I JUST MEN BENJAMIN BUT LOTS OF LOTS. WE ALSO DECIDE TWENTY TWENTY GROUPS LIKE THE PROUD BOYS OF THE SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZATIONS BRUTALIZED. THINKING EXPLICITLY ANTI MOSLEM. ARM THAT CAME OUT ONTO THE STREETS IN HUGE NUMBERS INVOLVED THEMSELVES INCREASINGLY VIOLENT COUNTER PROTESTS OR PROTESTS THEY THEMSELVES HELD. IT THERE WAS A LOT OF STREET FIGHTING INVOLVED AND- IT'S BEEN A SERIOUS SERIOUS PROBLEM AND IT'S SORT OF A NEW THING THAT STARTED HAPPENING. YOU KNOW AROUND THE TIME AS THE PANDEMIC TO THE COLD AND WE SAW. THE BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTS. I ASK. A NAY TWENTY TWENTY. WE ALSO THIRTY OTHER REFORM APPROACH OF THE INCREASINGLY BY. THE AND LOCK GALLAGHER LEADS TO THEIR WITH ONE DELICIOUS. IN VERY PLACES AND EVENTUALLY ADD EIGHT VAXXERS THEIR RANKS. AND WE THOUGHT OF LOSING AND LITERALLY ARMENIAN ARMED. WITH NEW PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO WALK OUT IN PROTEST AND SOMETIMES JUST IN SERVICE STORMING FOR EXAMPLE. EIGHT HOUSES. I AND WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A RELATIVELY RECENT PHENOMENON TO SEE PARAMILITARY MILITIA GROUPS. INCLUDING WOMEN WERE OVERLY RACES WORKING WITH WEISS'S PROMISES OR REFLECT THE PROBLEM. ON VARIOUS- POLITICAL ACTIVITIES THAT'S A VERY VERY. DIFFERENT THING IN RECENT YEARS. WE ALSO SAW TERROR WHAT IS HAVE TO OUT OF BECAUSE YOU'RE CRUSHING WHITMER WAS ONE. EXAMPLE WHY TO THE HAPPENING IN TWENTY FOUR. FIVE GROUP OF THE MILITIA- FOLKS WILL AFFECT THEIR WHO IS ALSO ORGANIZED ON FACEBOOK. THIS DATA FROM APPLE IS A DEPICTION OF THEACTIVITY EVOLUTION ARMED GROUPS BETWEEN MAY AND OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. YOU KNOW JUST LOOKING AT THIS YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF HOW SERIES OF NUMBER OF THE BASS WAS AND HOW MUCH ACTIVITY THERE WAS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT SOME OF THE SITUATIONS GOT QUITE OUT OF HAND AND BECAME QUITE DANGEROUS. HI AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A NUMBER OF EVENTS AND REPORTED FATALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH MALICIOUS ACTIVITY BECAME. BECAME A MUCH MORE VISIBLE PRESENCE ON PRESENCE ON THE STREETS AFTER MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY. SO YOU CAN SEE THE BLUE WHERE HE- KEEPERS WHICH IS A LARGE PUBLISHING GROUPS. AND THEIR PROBLEMS. AND FINALLY YOU CAN SEE HERE DECELERATION OF PROBABLY THE BEST THAT HAPPENED IN TWENTY TWENTY AND- TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I'D SAY THE MOST SOME OF THE MOST VIOLENT. SITUATIONS THAT WE HAD IN LATE TWENTY TWENTY INVOLVED PROBABLY INVOLVING THEMSELVES IN PROTEST. IN WASHINGTON DC IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. I THE LEADER OF THE GROUP IS NOW IN JAIL FOR DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY LACKS CHURCHES. IN WASHINGTON DC A GROUP IS BEING SUED SEVERAL SETTLING FOR THE ACTIONS THAT HAPPENED THEN. SO SOME MIGHT END OF TWENTY TWENTY. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TERMS THE STATE OF HATE AND ENERGIZED ENERGIZED WHITE SUPREMACIST MOVEMENT FEATURES NEW TYPES OF OVERTLY. VIOLENT GROUPS. MANY WARNING BROWN WHINING CONTINUES TO GROW ONLINE NAY FED BY REPLACING A CONSPIRACY THEORY. AND PROTEST YOU DURING THIS YEAR'S OF EXTREMIST RELIGIOUS CONSPIRACY THEORISTS WEISS PROMISES WITH EVERYONE AND YOU KNOW SOLUTIONS OF MILEAGE DURING PROTESTS. WE'VE ALSO SEEN RECENTLY A LOT OF ADDITIONAL LOGIN AFTER PLOTS. AND. I HAVE A FEELING AS- I LIVES. THAT ASKING TO COME MORE ALL TO LET REAL LITERALLY IN THE COMING MONTHS.

GOOD MORNING THE CAME AGAIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA EIGHT BILLION CALIFORNIA ACTION- THANK YOU TO THE CEREMONY THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE EVENING- ENABLE IT TO THE SPEAKERS SPECIFICALLY COULD HE COMMENTS ABOUT THE NEED FOR A STATE LEGISLATION HOWEVER SOME ARGUE WITH STATES THAT DON'T HAPPENING CRIME LEGISLATION REQUIRING LEGISLATION. AS WELL AS TEACHING OF EARLIER IT WAS FOR YOUR REMARKS ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS LITTLE PRIVACY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS- ETERNITY I HAVE SUGGESTIONS OR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATION TO PREVENT ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR HARM FOR EXAMPLE THE WINNING RESULTS- OF INCREASED PROFILING OR SURVEILLANCE OR HARASSMENT- FROM THE STATE OR LOCAL ENTITIES PARTICULARLY TO ALREADY MARGINALIZED GROUPS AS A RESULT OF ISLAMOPHOBIA HOMOPHOBIA. AND RACISM TO CANADA. I GOD SAID THIS IS YOUR- TO PROVIDE TO THE SELECTED- I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE QUESTION WAS THAT YOU WERE ASKING BUT I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY ALL IN AGREEMENT- THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS- AS THE- MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE IN THE- HEARINGS GOING FORWARD. AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST ON- I HATED ALL OF ITS FORMS. AND DEATH OF A WITH THE COMMISSION- THE NEWLY FORMED COMMISSION HASN'T TENDED TO DO. NEXT WELL SORRY ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK I THINK THAT- I WON'T LEAVE ROOM TO ASK BUT I CAN GET IN BUT I DIDN'T GET IT WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE COMMITTEE VOTED ON ASIA. HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT FUTURE LEGISLATION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOESN'T RESULT IN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AS WELL WORKING TO HAVE CONTACTED THE HE CRIME. FOR EXAMPLE NOT RESULTING IN INCREASED PROFILING RACIAL PROFILING AND SURVEILLANCE AND HARASSMENT- OF ALREADY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES FOR EXAMPLE HALF FULL TASK FORCES ALLEN- YOU KNOW EITHER URBAN COMMUNITY. COMMUNITY I THANK YOU. SO I THINK ALL OF. ALL LEGISLATORS ARE WELL OF TO TRY AND- AVOID UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THE- I KNOW A MYSTERIOUS AND I BOTH WHEN WE'RE EVALUATING. AND CARRYING LEGISLATION WE TRIED TO DO THAT WE DON'T ALWAYS- ANTICIPATE WITH SOME OF THOSE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ARE- AND IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S NOT UNCOMMON. TO DO WHAT WE CALL CLEAN UP LEGISLATION TO- TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION AFFECT SOME OF THE- I THINK THAT- LANGUAGE THAT MIGHT BE AND- IN- IN A BILL. THAT OCCURRED BECAUSE AS YOU SAY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO- GLAD THAT YOU RAISE THAT ISSUE SOMETHING THAT WE DO THINK ABOUT AND WILL CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE. THE WAY I HAVE THE NEXT BIG REPLACE. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM LINE TWENTY FIVE. GOOD EVENING- TO- ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BLOOM AND RANTS MY NAME'S RICHARD HIRSCH OUT I AM DECIDING CALIFORNIA DIRECTOR OF AMERICAN JEWISH COMMITTEE WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THE COMMUNITY AND TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR PASSING THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE ADDED WE HEARD FROM PREVIOUS SPEAKERS AS WE'VE HEARD. WITH RESPECT TO THE- JUST GUT WRENCHING TESTIMONY AND TESTIMONIALS ABOUT THE 80 DEGREES OF HATE AND PREJUDICE AND INFIDELITY THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCE IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY DURING THE PADDACK ONE THING IS CLEAR TO LOS. ANGELES CA THAT IS THAT HATE IS INDIVISIBLE AND WE MUST STAND SQUARELY SHOULDER TO SHOULDER TOGETHER AND UNIFIED IN THIS SHARED STRUGGLE TO- JUST SEE THE BETTER ANGELS OF OUR STATE AND PROVIDE COMFORT AND A SENSE OF- PEACE OF MIND SECURITY NOT ALL PEOPLE IN OUR STATE. WE SUPPORT WHOLEHEARTEDLY THE CREATION OF A NEW COMMISSION BECAUSE FUNDAMENTALLY THIS IS ABOUT ALLY SHIP THIS IS ABOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT CAUSES EACH OF US A. N.

ALL RIGHT- UNDER OF THIS EARLIER AND- THE- CORRECT. THANK YOU TO GROUPS OUT THERE THAT IS NOT A DEBATE ON VERY FAST FOOD IS KNOWN AS THE L. M. AND KEEP UP. THIS IS A VERY- TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN THE CORRECT INFORMATION THE AGES THERE AND THE INTERNET AT. ONE FIFTEEN NO ACTUALLY STARTED FIRES THAT. AND- YOU KNOW LOOKING INTO PART OF THE REPAIRS. THAT ALONG BUT IT'LL I DON'T KNOW DESIRE. WHICH IS VERY WALKING- THANK YOUNG IRISH NEED NOT APPLY.

A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THE SELECT COMMITTEE HOSTED AN EVENT CALLED- THAT WE ENTITLED TO A STATE OF HATE STATE OF HOPE. WHERE WE WERE PROVIDED. WITH SUCH TROUBLING STATISTICS AROUND HATE CRIMES THAT WERE MITIGATED BY SOCIAL SERVICE SURVEY. DATA THAT SHOWED INTERGROUP RACE RELATIONS WERE ACTUALLY IMPROVING DESPITE THE UPWARD TREND AND HATE CRIME AND- THIS MAY NO LONGER BE THE CASE. UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THESE FACTS AND FIGURES CAN BE OVERWHELMING AND DISCOURAGING AND I'M SURE THAT MANY OF YOU OUT THERE TUNING IN AT HOME. SHARE SIMILAR CONCERNS. SO WHAT DO WE DO HOW DO WE DIFFUSE THAT'S GROWING LEVEL OF HATE HOW DO WE BALANCE FREE SPEECH WITH INCENDIARY HATE SPEECH ON SOCIAL MEDIA HOW DO WE ENSURE. THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US FEEL SAFE. HEARD AND PROTECTED AS LEADERS IN OUR COMMUNITIES HOW DO WE PREPARE HANDLE POTENTIAL CONFRONTATIONS. AND RESPOND TO ACTS OF TARGETED VIOLENCE AS WE CONTINUE TO HOLD HEARING SUCH AS THIS I REMAIN HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL BE GUIDED TOWARDS FINDING ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS. AND MORE ARE WHICH AND MORE WHICH IS TANTAMOUNT TO OUR ABILITY TO CHALLENGE HATE AND VIOLENCE HAS GONE UP SO AS WE CONCLUDE OUR HEARING TODAY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RACE TO HAVE ANY CLOSING REMARKS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE. I THINK TO REPEAT SOMETHING YOU'D SERVICE SAID EARLIER AND THAT'S THAT WE CANNOT NORMALIZE HATE AND EXTREMISM. AND I THINK ONE OF THE COMMENTS FROM SOMEBODY WHO CALLED IN WAS THAT WE DIDN'T WE NEED TO STAND UNIFIED. AND I THINK THAT WE CAN AND WE WILL. YOU MENTIONED EARLIER IGNORANCE AND LACK OF UNDERSTANDING IS OFTEN AT THE ROOT OF THIS HATRED THIS EXTREMISM. AND WE HAVE TO FIGHT AGAINST IT.
