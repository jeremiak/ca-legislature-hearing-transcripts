STAGE ONE CHILD CARE WERE. OF FAMILIES ARE IT MOST IN FLUX TO CREATE THE STABILITY OF TWELVE MONTHS CONTINUOUS ELIGIBILITY IS PROBABLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO ON BEHALF OF STREAMLINING THE PROGRAM ON BEHALF OF OF THE LIVES OF THE FAMILY AND THE FAMILIES OF THE CHILDREN WHO ARE RECEIVING THE CHAPTER SERVICES.

JACKSON AYE PAN NIGHT CAN I AND WIENER. WIENER AYE. SIX AND THE MOTION ON THAT BILL WAS DUE PASSED TO EDUCATION. THE BILL IS OUT VERY MUCH. DO PASSED THE SENATE. SO UP NEXT BEST CENTER COMING AT ALL -- SB. TWO NINE EIGHT WELCOME SENATOR COMING AT ALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THE ANALYSIS. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SB. TO NINETY EIGHT WHICH WILL ESTABLISH SPECIFIC TARGETS THE END DEEP CHILD POVERTY IN FOUR YEARS AND REDUCE TRY CHILD POVERTY BY 50% BY TWENTY THIRTY NINE AND WE'RE GOING TO BE ADJUSTING THAT NUMBER -- DOWN. WHICH WILL PUT US ON A PATH TO REDUCING CHILD POVERTY IN OUR STATE. CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATE IN THE NATION. RECENT COMPREHENSIVE STUDIES SUCH AS THE REPORT BY THE LIFTING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY TASK FORCE AND THE NATIONAL STATE LIFTING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY TASK FORCE -- THIS BILL IS IS CRUCIAL THEIR OF ESSENTIALLY BEEN TWO REASONS THAT THE STATE IS NOT MADE. PROGRESS IN PAST YEARS IT ACTUALLY REDUCING. THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN POVERTY IN THE FORD AND FIFTY THOUSAND CHILDREN. IN DEEP POVERTY IN THE STATE LEGISLATURES DONE A TERRIFIC JOB IN MAINTAINING THE SAFETY NET AND FIGHTING TO EXPAND IT. BUT THE NUMBER AND PERCENTAGE OF CHILDREN IN POVERTY HAS GONE UP AND DOWN A BIT WITH THE ECONOMY BUT NEVER REALLY BEEN REDUCED THEIR TWO REASONS FOR THAT. THE FIRST IS THERE IS NOT BEEN A COMPREHENSIVE EVIDENCE BASED PLAN DATABASE PLAN. TO DID PROVIDE A ROAD MAP. TO ELIMINATE THE CHILD POVERTY IN REDUCE OVERALL CHILD POVERTY BY AT LEAST 50%. THAT IS NOW THEN PROVIDED A BY THE TASK FORCE AND THE PRIORITY BILLS OF ALL BEEN INTRODUCED AS LEGISLATION. BUT THE SECOND CRITICAL POINT IS THERE NEEDS TO BE A STATED STATE GOAL. AND THEN REGULAR MEASUREMENTS THE TRACK THE PROGRESS TOWARDS MEETING THE CALL. SO THAT THIS COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT WHAT ELSE PERHAPS NEEDS TO BE DONE WHAT CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE IN ORDER TO MEET THAT GOAL. SO THE CRITICAL PIECE IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY REDUCING CHILD AND FAMILY POVERTY IN THE STATE. IS NOT JUST IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT THE PASSAGE. OF SB TO NINETY EIGHT SO THAT THERE ARE REGULAR MEASUREMENTS SO THAT YOU CAN TRACK PROGRESS TOWARDS THE GOAL. GOOD AFTERNOON HOME TO TARA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MAHDI THE LUNAR I'M APPARENTLY TO REPRESENTING CAN'T VOICES -- WHEN WE IS FAMILIES UTILIZE SOCIAL SERVICES THE STATE REQUIRES ACCOUNTABILITY FROM US FOR ME -- I MYSELF IN WE AS PARENTS FILL UP HUNDREDS OF FORMS COPIES OF OUR DOCUMENTS -- WE HAVE TO CHECK IF THERE'S ANY CHANGES WE HAVE TO PROVIDE ALL INFORMATION -- IF THE COSTLY PROVE THAT WE ARE STILL ELIGIBLE FOR THESE PROGRAMS. I WAS EVEN PERSONALLY -- PERSONALLY FINGERPRINTED WHEN I APPLIED FOR CAL WORKS TWO YEARS AGO SO YOU HAD TO GIVE UP MY OWN FINGERPRINT. CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTABLE TO PARENTS LIKE ME WHO ARE WORKING HARD TO MAKE ENDS MEET. WE LIKE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT WERE NO LONGER WILLING TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO. THAT IN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. WE SHOULD HAVE TO BE THE HIGHEST RATED HIGHEST RATE OF CHILD POVERTY IN THE NATION. TO THIS BILL PROVIDES A COPY OF ITS APPROACH TO ADDRESSING POVERTY FOR FAR TOO LONG WE HAVE FUND SOME PROGRAMS AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS WHEN IN REALITY. LOW INCOME FAMILIES WHO LIVE IN EXTREME POVERTY NEED ALL OF IT. ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS. TO BUG BECAME THE CAPITOL ONE DAY TOTAL LESSER EVERY MONTH THAT THEY BUDGET THEIR FAMILY INCOME DOWN TO THE LAST DROP OF MILK IN THE FRIDGE. THIS IS THE IMPACT OF LIVING ANTI POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA. ASK YOU DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH A DROP OF OIL COSTS. WELL MY FRIEND YOU BUT DOES. FAR TOO LONG FAMILIES AND CHILDREN BEEN IN BY VISIBLE LIKE MINES IN THE STATE IN OUR SOCIETY WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF POVERTY THEY THINK OF A PICTURE OF A DAHLE AND USUALLY NOT OUR MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN. I'M A SOLE PARENT. IN A SOLO PARENT HOUSEHOLD WITH EXTREME PRICES IN HOUSING AND CHILD CARE MY FAMILY IS ONE OF THE FAMILIES THIS CHIP LEGISLATION COVERS. BEAN INVISIBLE OF SOCIETY ALSO FURTHER PLACES SHAME ACOSTA SEROTYPES UPON CHILDREN AND FAMILIES LET'S OPEN THE BLINDS AND SHINE THE LIGHT AND VOTE HI AND PASSED SB TWO EIGHT ON THREE THREE TWO THREE TWO NINE EIGHT BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY TO GET OUT THE LOWEST POVERTY RATE.

I'M JUST WONDERING HOW DO YOU ENVISION THIS WORKING. SO I MEAN ESTIMATING THE IMPACTS OF VARIOUS POLICY AND PROGRAMS ON CHILD POVERTY IN DEEP POVERTY. TELL ME HOW YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO WORK. THE PART OF THE WORK OF THE LITTLE CHILDREN FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY TASK FORCE WAS TO PROVIDE A RANGE OF CRITERION MEASUREMENTS. THAT HAVE BEEN THE ONES THAT -- THE STANFORD CENTER AND POVERTY INEQUALITY THE BUDGET CENTER PP I SEE HAVE ALL USED. TO PROVIDE ACTUAL MEASUREMENTS BASED ON ESTABLISHED CRITERIA AND THE IDEA IS TO YOU TO ESSENTIALLY USE THOSE SAME CRITERION MEASUREMENTS. SO WE WILL AND IT'S NOTED THAT THE COMMITTEE -- MAY OF SUPPORT MAY SUGGEST SOME KIND OF PHONE AMENDMENT TO CLARIFY THAT SO WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING WITH WHAT ALREADY IS RATHER THAN. CLEARLY WE HAVE ANYTIME ACCOMPLISHED WHAT THE THOSE KIND OF THEORETICAL ASPIRATIONS ARE -- BUT ARE YOU [inaudible] IS IT. AMERICAN PHRASES FRIED -- ARE WE ARE WE LOOKING HERE. TOO DO AN ACCOUNTABILITY FRAMEWORK IS THAT WHAT THIS IS IS THAT YOUR GOAL OR IS IT A PROGRAMMATIC FRAMEWORK. WILL IT. IT'S TWO FOLD OKAY ITS FIRST. TO ACTUALLY MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE GOAL -- THERE IS SO THEY KNOW THE JUST LIKE RUNNING A BUSINESS YOU WANT YOU WANT TO SEE IF WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS WORKING AND WHETHER PERHAPS YOU NEED TO CONSIDER OTHER THINGS THE SECOND IS. TO LOOK AT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE PROGRAMS THEMSELVES TO SEE. THE LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT -- ARE A PROGRAMS WORKING OR THEY AND THEY NOT WORKING ARE THEY BEING COST EFFECTIVE ALL OF THOSE KIND OF ISSUES SO THAT AGAIN YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE GOAL. AND WITH REGARD TO THE MEASUREMENTS AND CRITERIA. THE THE THE WHAT'S THE TASK FORCE USING THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE BILL ARE ARE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN USED THEY CRIED AT YOU MAY WANT TO ADD THEM IN AND AS SOON AS THINGS MOVE FORWARD BUT FOR RIGHT NOW THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE. USABLE PROBLEM WITH MOST BUSINESSES THEIR MEASUREMENTS QUITE SYMBOL ARE THEY MAKING MONEY -- YOU KNOW THESE HEARD THESE CRITERIA A REPORT THAT HELPS US TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEST SPEND OUR OUR VALUABLE TAX DOLLARS AND HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THE MOST BANG FOR OUR BUCK.

THIS BILL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. IN A FOR RICHARD. OF FROM MY CHIEF OF STAFF -- CURRENT FEDERAL LAW. REQUIRES THE GOVERNOR OF EACH STATE TO DESIGNATE A PRIVATE. NONPROFIT CORPORATION FOR THE PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY OF THE RIGHTS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES -- SB THREE NINETY EIGHT WOULD UPDATE THAT STATE LAW REGARDING CALIFORNIA'S PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY AGENCY. TO CONFORM CALIFORNIA LAW THE FEDERAL PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY A AGENCY REGULATIONS THAT WERE ADOPTED IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN THIS BILL ALSO SPECIFICALLY CLARIFIES THAT THE MEANING OF QUOTE UNQUOTE FACILITY OR PROGRAM. INCLUDE THE FACILITY USED TO HOUSE OR DETAIN NON CITIZENS FOR THE PURPOSE OF CIVIL IMMIGRATION CUSTODY. THE STAINING THIS ACCESS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN LIGHT OF A RECENT REPORT BY DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. WHICH IS CALIFORNIA'S AGENCY AND THE SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE. THAT REPORT WAS REGARDING THE TREATMENT OF PERSONS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND OTHER DISABILITIES. IN THE IMMIGRATION THESE TEND TO IMMIGRATION -- DETENTION AT G. E. O. GROUPS ARE THE LAN DOLE ICE PROCESSING CENTER IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. AMONG OTHER FINDINGS THAT REPORT FOUND THAT -- THE LAWN TOLL HAD INADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH CARE. AND MEDICAL CARE FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. MADE ALL THE WORSE BY THE FACILITIES COUNTERED THERAPEUTIC CONDITIONS AND PRACTICES. IT ALSO FOUND THAT THE G. E. O. GROUP SIGNIFICANTLY. UNDER REPORTS DATA ON THE NUMBER OF SUICIDE ATTEMPTS. THAT OCCUR AT ALL DILLON. TO THOUGH THIS MEASURE IS UNOPPOSED CONCERNS WERE RECENTLY RAISED BY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES. AND THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. MY SPONSOR AND I HAVE PLEDGED TO WORK WITH THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. PRIOR TO THE NEXT POLICY COMMITTEE HEARING ON THIS BILL IN SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. NOW FOR WITNESSES CAN SPEAK PLEASE. BETTER CHECK HER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA -- AS WELL AS MAJOR BY CENTER DOOR -- SO DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA'S THE PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY PROGRAM FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE THE LARGEST PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY PROGRAM -- IN THE IN THE COUNTRY -- THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL IS THAT IT TAKES -- WHAT IS FOUND IN THREE BASIC FEDERAL -- DIFFERENT FEDERAL STATUTORY SCHEMES THAT PROVIDES PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY PROGRAMS THE ACCESS. TO FACILITIES TO DETERMINE AND ASSESS THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE DISABILITIES WITH IN THOSE -- WITHIN THOSE FACILITIES SO THAT AUTHORITY EXTENDS TO NOT ONLY -- ENTERING INTO THE FACILITIES BUT CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS WITHIN THOSE FACILITIES SEEKING REPORTS -- ON CONDITIONS WITHIN THE FACILITIES AND THEN ULTIMATELY -- PROVIDING REPORTS -- TO PROVIDE SOME TRANSPARENCY WITH TO WHAT HAPPENS IN THE THE COMMITTEES ARE IN THE FACILITIES. THE AUTHORITY HAS BANNED BY IN LARGE CODIFIED WITH THE AND CALIFORNIA STATE LAW ON IT PROVIDES A LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY -- WITHIN -- WITHIN CALIFORNIA HOWEVER THERE WAS A SET OF REGULATIONS -- FEDERAL REGULATIONS DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY REGULATIONS THAT WERE PROMULGATED IN. NINETEEN FIFTY TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND THIS BILL CODIFIES -- THOSE REGULATIONS ALONG WITH ALL OF THE OTHER STATUTORY AUTHORITY AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES THAT EXTENT OF THIS OF FEDERAL LAW. WE WE DO AS THE CENTER NOTED WE DO ADD -- WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF A FACILITY THE CIVIL IMMIGRATION DETENTION CENTERS -- WE HAVE THAT AUTHORITY -- UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THE TRANSPARENCY IN THAT THAT IS NOTED WITHIN -- STATE LAWS WELL WE HAVE BEEN IN -- MOST OF THE DETENTION FACILITIES UNDER THIS AUTHORITY AND CALIFORNIA AND AND VARYING LEVELS OF OF REVIEW -- WE SPENT TIME IN THE YOLO YOUTH FACILITY AND ADELANTO AS WELL -- AND I WOULD JUST -- NOTE THIS MORNING -- THE LA TIMES HAD REPORTED ON THE TERMINATION -- BY THE CITY WITH A CONTRACT WITH -- ICE AND AS THEY NOTED -- A LOSS OF LAYER OF OVERSIGHT THAT THE THAT FACILITY MAY HAVE -- WE CONTINUE TO HAVE AND WANT TO ENSURE THAT -- OUR STATE LAW -- ACKNOWLEDGES THAT AUTHORITY TO ENTER THOSE FACILITIES WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOUR IPHONE ON THE BILL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS ANDREA RIVERA REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. WE'RE HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE NINETY EIGHT AND IN PARTICULAR -- A SPECIFIC PROVISION OF THE BILL WHICH WOULD EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF A FACILITY OR PROGRAM TO INCLUDE IMMIGRANT DETENTION CENTERS. OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS -- TO INCREASE OVERSIGHT OF IMMIGRANT DETENTION FACILITIES SPECIFICALLY WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB ONE OH THREE AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AB -- ONE OH THREE MANDATES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO MONTOR AND PRODUCE A REPORT ON THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE FOUND IN IMMIGRANT DETENTION FACILITIES. AND THE AG'S OFFICE -- RELEASED THE FIRST REPORT EARLIER THIS YEAR IN FEBRUARY -- AND IN THE REPORT THEY DETAIL THE DIFFICULTIES THAT DETAINEES OFTEN FACE WHEN ACCESSING -- OR ATTEMPTING TO ACCESS -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THEREBY INCREASING THE RISK ON THAT A DETAINEE CAN EXPERIENCE A A MENTAL HEALTH INCIDENT -- AS NOTED BY THE ACLU -- INCIDENCES OF SUICIDE AND DEATH AND IMMIGRANTS TENSION FACILITIES ARE AT AN ALL TIME HIGH. OF FEDERAL OFFICIALS REPORT THAT APPROXIMATELY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY DETAINED WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES AND NEED ASSISTANCE -- HOWEVER -- HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS CONTINUOUSLY -- REPORT -- REPEATED INSTANCES OF DETAINEES NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THE MENTAL CARE THAT THEY DESERVE. AMONG THE MOST RECENT TRAGIC CASES -- MISTER JOSE ANTONIO FRANCO GONZALEZ HE WAS A MEXICAN IMMIGRANT WITH A SEVERE MENTAL DISABILITY. AND HE WAS DETAINED FOR FIVE YEARS WITH NO -- ACCESS TO A LAWYER OR A HEARING -- MISTER FRANKEL GONZALEZ IS FAMILY WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE HIM AND HE WAS UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE TO TO HAS A MENTAL DISABILITY. MISTER FRANKEL GONZALEZ'S CASE RESULTED IN WHAT IS NOW KNOWN AS THE FRANCO ROLLING. REQUIRING LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR DETAINEES THAT ARE MENTALLY IMPAIRED. HOWEVER WE STILL HAVE NO ONE TO VOUCH FOR THE CONDITIONS THAT TAKE PLACE INSIDE THE MENTAL. I'M SORRY INSIDE THESE FACILITIES AND SB THREE NINETY EIGHT ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER -- STATE PROTECTIONS WOULD HELP ENSURE THAT -- THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE DETAINED AND WE NEED -- MENTAL HEALTH ASSISTANCE RECEIVE THOSE SERVICES. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT SB. THREE NINETY EIGHT THANK YOU WE WILL NOW OPEN UP A FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS BILL SB. THREE NINE EIGHT OUR THIS BILL DOES HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IS THERE ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL PLEASE COME UP. RATHER STATE COUNCIL DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES RISING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. KEVIN AS THE COLORS CALIFORNIA WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU.

IS THERE ANYONE -- IS THERE ANYONE ELSE NOT IS WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS THEIR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. NOW OKAY GREAT [inaudible] SO. TWO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR CENTRE BELL [inaudible] OF THIS THIS SIR DISCUSSION TOOK PLACE AND WE HAD A DISCUSSION IN THE MENTAL HEALTH. CAUCUSES -- ABOUT THIS ISSUE IN A PRESENTATION AND HOW HOW WOULD I PUT IT -- I THINK THE GENERAL CONSENSUS WAS OUTRAGE THAT. THESE CONDITIONS EXISTED AND CALIFORNIA -- TO ME HE IS THE KIND OF THING IF IF SOMETHING WAS DONE WITH THE CHILDREN. ESPECIALLY -- I WOULD WONDER WHY WE DO BUSINESS WITH THEM AND MANY OTHER AREAS SO THE KIND OF A QUESTION. WHETHER CONTRACTS THAT WE HAVE AT THE STATE LEVEL. WITH COMPANIES THAT -- ONE OBSERVER LAWS TRIGGER JEWEL IN THIS WAY I KIND OF WONDER WHY WE SHOULD DO BUSINESS WITH THESE ORGANIZATIONS. SO WE STRUCK EARLY WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS BILL. WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO STAND UP FOR THESE SO OF THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE THIS IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES SO. I WOULD STRONGLY URGE SUPPORT FOR THIS. THANK YOU SENATOR DRAWS SO HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO A CLOSE. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO WE HAVE MOTION. AND THE MOTION IS. TO TO PASS THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. DR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FOR TITLE. I RETIRED I STONE. STONE HI BEL. BEL AYE JACKSON. PAN BY PAN AYE WIENER RIGHT WIENER I FIVE ZERO OKAY. THE COUNTESS FIVE ZERO AND WE WILL I'LL HOLD THE BILL AND IT WILL BE ON CALL [inaudible] AND MEMBERS. OUR NEXT BILL WE HAVE SENATOR SKINNER. TWO PRESENTS SENATE BILL. AT THREE THREE SEVEN WELCOME SENATOR SKINNER AND TO YOUR WITNESSES. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANKS SO MUCH. MY WITNESSES WILL COME UP TO THE TABLE JUST START. SIR SB THREE THREE SEVEN DEALS WITH THE FACT THAT IN -- THERE'S A FEDERAL LAW. THAT SAYS IF YOU ARE A FAMILY THAT RECEIVES BENEFITS FOR EXAMPLE -- WE ASK FOR CALIBRATION THAT. IF THERE IS A NON CUSTODIAL PARENT PAYING CHILD SUPPORT BENEFITS. YOU THE FAMILY THAT IS THE CUSTODIAL PARENT ONLY RECEIVES FIFTY DOLLARS OF THE PAYMENT OF THAT CHILD SUPPORT. AND THE REMAINING CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS GOES TO THE GOVERNMENT. TO COVER THESE BENEFITS. AND OF COURSE IF THE NONCUSTODIAL PARENT. CANNOT AFFORD TO MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS THEN FINES INTERESTING CREW AND EVEN TO THE POINT WHERE IT BECOMES A CRIME IS PUNISHABLE BY RIME. SO WHAT SB THREE THREE SEVEN DOES IS TWO THINGS. ONE IT. BENEFITS THE CHILDREN BY SAYING LOOK IF THE NONCUSTODIAL PARENT HAS THE ABILITY TO PAY. THEN THAT PAYMENT SHOULD GO DIRECTLY TO THE FAMILY AND TO COVER THE COSTS OF THE CHILDREN. SO THE FAMILY CAN RECEIVE MORE THAN FIFTY DOLLARS. AND IF THAT CUSTODIAL PARENT. NON CUSTODIAL SKEWS ME GETS IN ARREARS. THAT IT IS NO LONGER A CRIMINAL FACTOR. BUT WE CAN PURSUE AS WE DO WONDER ARE THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER STATUTES IN CALIFORNIA LAW. TO TRY TO HELP COLLECT THAT -- ARREARS CHILD SUPPORT. BUT THAT DIDN'T GET. THAT MAY BE THAT MAY HAVE ARISEN. DUE TO THE THIS FEDERAL LAW CAN BE THE STATE CAN EXPANSION. SO THEN. THERE IS -- DE. NON CUSTODIAL PARENT IF THEY ARE IN A POSITION FINALLY TO BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR AREARS CHILD SUPPORT YOU CAN GO TO THE CHILDREN AND IT HAS A CRUDE. BUT THE SAD OUTRAGEOUS INTERESTS AND SUCH WHICH BASICALLY KEEPS THAT NON. PARENT IN POVERTY AND BE REALLY INABILITY TO PAY FOR THE TRUCK HERE. ARE THE D.. THE CHILD SUPPORT YES OKAY SO THAT'S WHAT IT DOES AND NOW I'M GOING TO ALLOW MY WITNESSES WHO ARE CHRIS TO BROWN. RIGHT FROM THE FINANCIAL JUSTICE PROJECT IN SF AND RENAULT HAMPTON FROM GROWING GREATNESS. ALL RIGHT -- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME MY NAME IS RON I'LL HAVE TO SUPPORT IT STARTED TO BE PRESENTING TODAY -- GROWING UP ONE OF SIX KIDS I EXPRESS HOW HARD IT WAS FOR MY MOTHER RAISING -- DUE TO A FEDERAL STATE CHILD SUPPORT POLICIES MY MOTHER ONLY RECEIVE FIFTY DOLLARS OF THE SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT WAS BEING GARNISHED FROM MY FATHER'S PAYCHECK. THAT MONEY COULD HAVE BEEN -- USED TO AVOID OUR LIGHTS IN WATER BEING CUT OFF AT TIMES. ARE EVEN GOING TO SUPPORT MY COLLEGE EXPENSES WHEN I GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL. IS THAT MY SIBLINGS AND I HAD TOO MUCH WERE A LOT EARLIER THAN WE SHOULD HAVE. TO FEEL THAT FINANCIAL GAP. WHILE MANY OF OUR PEERS WERE FOCUSED ON SCHOOLS WE FOUND WAYS TO FEEL THAT FINANCIAL GAP IN OUR HOUSEHOLD. WE CARRY GROCERIES WE PUMP GAS. WASH CARS IN EVEN SOLD CANDY TO HELP OUT OUR MOM WE MISSED TUTORING OPPORTUNITIES SPORTING EVENTS FAMILY OUTINGS BECAUSE OF CHILD SUPPORT POLICY. SKINNER SAID IT BILL -- THREE THREE SEVEN IS GOING TO ADDRESS OUR HELP TO FIGHT RE DIRECT THAT'S HOW SUPPORT FUNDS DIRECTLY TO THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WHO REALLY NEED THEM AND WHO THOSE FINES ARE INTENDED. FOR MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE DIRECTLY REPRESENTS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT BILL TO PUSH. FOR AND SO THIS WILL ENSURE THAT MOVING FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA DO NOT GET WEALTHY EXTRACTED OUT OF THEIR FAMILIES DUE TO TOSS SUPPORT POLICY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS MY NAME IS CRYSTAL BROWN AND I'M WITH THE FINANCIAL JUSTICE PROJECT AND THE SAN FRANCISCO TREASURER'S OFFICE. WE'VE CO AUTHORED THIS REPORT THAT REVEALS THAT EVERY YEAR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES DO NOT RECEIVE THEIR FULL CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS. THAT'S BECAUSE FAMILIES LIKE RUN ELSE THAT RECEIVE PUBLIC BENEFITS ONLY GET THE FIRST FIFTY DOLLARS OF THEIR CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS. THE REST IS RE DIRECTED TO REPAY THE COST OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE LIKE MEDICAID I'LL AND CAL WORKS. LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA COLLECTED. FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN WHO RECEIVED CAL WORKS THE POOREST CHILDREN IN OUR STATE. ONLY A FRACTION OF THOSE PAYMENTS ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH THE CHILDREN. 90% SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WERE REDIRECTED TO REPAY THE COST OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. THESE POLICIES TAKE VALUABLE RESOURCES FROM LOW INCOME CHILDREN. DISPROPORTIONATELY HARM CHILDREN OF COLOR AND SET UP LOW INCOME PARENTS TO FAIL. WE'VE HEARD FROM COUNTLESS FAMILIES BUT THE SYSTEM DRIVES PARENTS TO WORK IN THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY SO THEY CAN SEND THEIR EARNINGS DUE TO THEIR FAMILY. IT CREATES CONFLICT BETWEEN PARENTS BECAUSE THE CUSTODIAL PARENT OFTEN DOESN'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE NONCUSTODIAL PARENT IS ACTUALLY PAYING ON THEIR CHILD'S BEHALF. OTHER STATES HAVE ALREADY TAKEN A STAND TO WRITE THIS HISTORIC WRONG -- COLORADO IS THE FIRST STATE TO PASS THROUGH 1100% OF PARENTS PAYMENTS THROUGH TO THEIR CHILDREN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS WENT UP. 63%. PARENTS PAID NOT MORE BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT THE MONEY WAS GOING TO WEAR IT SHOULD TO THEIR CHILDREN. I WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF SENATOR SCANNERS SB THREE THREE SEVEN AND I ENCOURAGE THE SENATORS TO WRITE THIS IS STORK WRONG AND PUT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES FIRST. THANK YOU. ARE WE WILL GO AHEAD AND OPEN UP A FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU JUST GIVE OUR FLOW FROM THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY OR SPONSOR AND SUPPORT. CLICK HERE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. KEVIN AS THE COURSE OF CALIFORNIA ROUGH ORGANIZATIONS STRONG SUPPORT -- CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA NAY WILL SPEAK FROM THE POSITION OF A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO BACK IN TWO THOUSAND IS THE FOUNDING DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES WE UNDERSTOOD THEN. THE IMPORTANCE OF DOLLARS GETTING DIRECTLY TO FAMILIES OF THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS AND IT CONTINUES TO BE TRUE. IT'S BEEN A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK BUT THIS IS THE RIGHT BILL TO TRYING TO THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU. HEY THIS BILL HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT BUT DO WE HAVE ANYONE SAYS IN OPPOSITION. TO THE WOULD LIKE TO COME FORWARD [inaudible] NO OKAY. TWO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. SENATOR STONE AND CENTER JACKSON THANK YOU -- MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORSKINNER -- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORD. I'M KIND OF OUTRAGE BY THIS WHOLE PROGRAM THIS IS YOU KNOW I'M NEW ON THIS COMMITTEE AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THE CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY THE NONCUSTODIAL PARENT WERE BEING DIRECTLY BENEFITING THE KIDS -- WE ALL KNOW THAT THE AMOUNT OF HELP THAT. THOSE LIVING IN POVERTY GET FROM THE GOVERNMENT IS AN OFTEN ENOUGH. TO KEEP THEM -- WHILE TAKING CARE FIVE MINS AGO MAN YOU'RE A PRIME EXAMPLE OF THAT AND CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR SUCCESS IN MOVING OUT OF POVERTY -- THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND IT ALLOWS -- CERTAINLY THE NONCUSTODIAL PAYMENT A PAIR TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE DOING THEIR FAIR SHARE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR KIDS. LOTS OF PLANTING THE THE STATE BUDGET THAT IS GIVING MONEY WHAT WHAT ON ANOTHER HAND. SO -- I REALLY. PART YOU BRING IN A FORD I'D I'D EVEN LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR POSSIBLE BECAUSE I FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT YOUR EFFORT HERE TODAY AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO MOVE IT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND APPRECIATE THE WITNESSES STEPPING FORWARD AS WELL. THANK YOU WE WILL -- DO THAT. ANDERSON SENATE JCKSON THANK YOU SO IN A PRIOR LIFE IHAD THE JOYFUL PLEASURE OF TRYING TO COLLECT CHILD SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS I HAD. THIS WAS BEFORE WE EVEN HANDED THIS OVER TO THE DA'S OFFICE AND THEN WE TOOK IT AWAY FROM THE DA'S AND CREATED A SEPARATE DIVISION OF CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT. BECAUSE COLLECTING CHILD SUPPORT HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN ENORMOUS CHALLENGE. SADLY SADLY PARENTS. SHOULD UNDERSTAND AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUPPORTING THEIR CHILDREN -- PART OF THE PROBLEM JUST TO TO SORT OF GIVE SOME CONTEXT TO MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM TEMECULA. WAS THAT IN THE IN THE PAST THE NOTION THAT PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY HAD THE AUDACITY TO COLLECT WELFARE. IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THE WELFARE SYSTEM HAD TO BE REIMBURSED. AND SO THAT MONEY INSTEAD OF GOING TO THESE CHILDREN HAD TO GO BACK TO THE STATE. FOR THESE PROGRAMS -- AT LEAST THAT WAS THE POLICY BACK THEN -- LEVEL OF POVERTY THAT YOUNG CHILDREN OR AND OR THE CHILDREN EXPERIENCE TODAY IS SO APPALLING. OF THAT -- THERE'S QUESTION NO QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING THIS MY ONLY CONCERN NOW -- WILL TWO THINGS ONE IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAMMERED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR YEARS BECAUSE WE WERE NOT OBTAINING THE CHILD SUPPORT COLLECTION RATES THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED. TO SO WE PAID ENORMOUS PENALTIES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE AN AFFECTED CHILD SUPPORT COLLECTION SYSTEM SO THE MONEY COULD GO BACK. TO THE PUBLIC FISKE -- WE THEN I THINK AFTER A LOT OF HARD WORK FIX THE HAVE PROBLEM -- I'M APPALLED FRANKLY THAT WE STILL NOT GIVING THE THE MONEY DIRECTLY TO THE CHILDREN SO I SHARE THAT WITH CENTER STONE BUT THAT WAS THE ARGUMENT IS THAT. IF THE TAXPAYER HAS TO BE PAYING FOR THESE CHILDREN BECAUSE A PARENT WON'T THAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE MONEY THAT WE GET FROM THE PARENTS AND REIMBURSE THE STATE FOR IT AND THE CHILDREN OBVIOUSLY WITH THE ONES WHO SUFFERED. THE BUT THERE'S STILL A CHALLENGE TODAY AND I WONDERED WHAT TWO THINGS ONE IS THAT AS FAR AS FEDERAL LAWS CONCERN BECAUSE WE DON'T COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAW WE GET HAMMERED -- AND I'D RATHER SEE THAT MONEY GOING TO OUR TO OUR KIDS -- THE SECOND CONCERN I HAVE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU MAKE CHILD SUPPORT SO ONEROUS YOU WON'T GET THE NON CUSTODIAL PARENT TO PAY IT. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND. I DON'T WANT TO GIVE NON CUSTODIAL PARENTS EXCUSES NOT TO PAY THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO THEIR CHILDREN. SO I'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN AND THAT'S A BALANCE IF YOU CAN RESPOND BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY HOW DO WE MAKE SURE. AND AND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU BECAUSE I SAW THIS HAPPEN IN IN MY PRACTICE -- YEARS AGO -- THAT THERE ARE NON CUSTODIAL PARENTS WHO JUST AREN'T GOING TO PAY. THEY DON'T WANNA. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT AND SO THEY GO TO THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY THEY DO ALL THEIR BUSINESS AND CASH THEY DON'T. HAVE ANY DESIRE A SADLY TO SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN. THERE'S NOTHING THAT RANKLES ME MORE THAN THAT SO I'M WONDERING WHAT HOW YOU AND I'M SURE THAT RANKLES YOU TOO BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY -- HOW DOES THIS BILL ADDRESS THAT CHALLENGE? OUR MANAGER MAY I ANSWER. THROUGH THE CHAIR [inaudible] PLEASE -- THE BILL DOES NOT. LET OFF THE HOOK THE NON CUSTODIAL PARENT. BUT WHAT IT DOES IS [inaudible] SO THE SO. DE CUSTODIAL PARENT CAN STILL PURSUE THE COLLECTION TO THE NON CUSTODIAL. WHAT IT DOES IS JUST GUARANTEE THAT WHAT EVER THE NON CUSTODIAL PARENT PAYS GOES TO THE CHILDREN? WHICH IS THE ABSURDITY OF OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IN THAT WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY WE THE STATE TO GO AFTER AND COLLECT. BUT THEN WHATEVER IT IS WE DO COLLECT DOESN'T EVEN GO TO THE CHILDREN. AND THE THE REASON WE WERE BEING PENALIZED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BY THE FEDS IS BECAUSE WE WERE WE HAD NOT DISCHARGED THAT DEBT UNDER THE LAW WE WERE ALLOWED TO DISCHARGE THE DEBT BUT WE DIDN'T AND SO INSTEAD WE SHOWED IT DEBT. AND THEN WE HAD -- LOW LOW RECOVERY OF IT. WHICH UNFORTUNATELY LOW RECOVERY IS NOT UNUSUAL BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. BY AND LARGE PEOPLE THAT EVEN THE NON CUSTODIAL PARENT IS NOT NECESSARILY HIGH INCOME. BUT CERTAINLY THERE'S EVIDENCE AS WAS INDICATED THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF COLORADO THAT ONCE THE PARENT UNDERSTANDS THAT THEIR ACTIONS THEIR MONEY IS ACTUALLY GOING TO THE CHILDREN. THEY'RE MORE WILLING TO PAY AND MORE PAYMENT HE ACTUALLY COMES TO THE CHILDREN SO THAT'S OUR HOPE -- AND YES WE WOULD STILL. WE WOULD STILL ALLOW EVERY LEGAL RIGHT FOR THE FAMILY THE THE CUSTODIAL PARENT TO READ. TO RECOVER ANY OF THAT PAYMENT THAT STILL OWED TO THEM. OKAY I JUST -- JUST NOTE THAT AGAIN IT DOESN'T RESOLVE THE ENTIRE ISSUE. BUT I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE. TRYING TO DO AND I APPRECIATED NOW WILL BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL IN THE CENTER STONE ALREADY DID THAT. WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

CONSIDERED NGUYEN PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE COLLEAGUES -- SB. TWO SIXTY EIGHT ELIMINATES THE CASH ASSET TEST IN THE VEHICLE ACCESS ASSET TO THE VEHICLE ASSET TESTING CAL WORKS. ARE CURRENTLY -- FOR CAL WORKS ARE RECIPIENT -- AN APPLICANT IS ALLOWED TO HAVE NO MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. IN CASH ASSETS IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR CAL WORKS IF. A PERSON HAS THE GALL TO ACCUMULATE ANY ADDITIONAL SAVINGS BEYOND THAT -- THEY'RE NO LONGER THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR CAL WORKS. IN ADDITION -- THE VEHICLE ASSET TEST FOR CAL WORKS. LIMITS -- THE VALUE OF SOMEONE'S CAR TO NINE THOUSAND AND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS SO IF THE CAR HAPPENS TO BE WORTH MORE THAN THAT THE CAR THEY USED TO GO TO WORK OR TO SCHOOL -- THEN -- YOU ARE -- INELIGIBLE -- BE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ODD VALUES ASSET TESTS WHICH ARE NOT REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW -- IS HUGE -- A RECENT STUDY BY HOWARD UNIVERSITY ESTIMATED -- COST SAVINGS OF ELIMINATING THE ASSET TO US -- AT A HUNDRED SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. CALIFORNIANS ARE CURRENTLY BEING DISCOURAGED FROM SAVING. MONEY -- BY THIS ASSET TEST. WE SHOULD BE WANTING -- LOW INCOME PEOPLE TO TRY TO MOVE OUT OF POVERTY AND YOU DO THAT -- BY SAVING MONEY -- BUT IF SAVING MONEY MEANS YOU NO LONGER GET BENEFITS -- THAT'S A HUGE DISINCENTIVE TO SAVING -- WE ALSO KNOW -- THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE COURSE NEED THEIR CAR JUST TO SURVIVE. SO WE SHOULD NOT BE CREATING AN INCENTIVE -- NOT TO HAVE A CAR OR TO HAVE A CAR -- THAT BROWN'S DOESN'T WORK SO WELL -- OTHER STATES -- IN THE U. US OF PASSED SIMILAR LEGISLATION -- TO MOVE AWAY FROM HIS ASSET TESTS AND CALIFORNIA SHOULD DO THE SAME AGAIN IT'S NOT REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW -- WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL OR JUST PART OF THE LOWER HALF OF THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. AND BECKY GROSJEAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. A GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS BACK YOUR SON FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS I'M WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB. TWO TO SIXTY EIGHT ON OUR NETWORK OF FORTY ONE FOOD BANKS IN OVER SIX THOUSAND AGENCY PARTNERS HOP AND MISSION TO END HUNGER IN CALIFORNIA -- AND WE KNOW THAT AMONGST THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES THAT ACCESS FREE GROCERIES EVERY DAY. I'M CAL WORKS FAMILIES ARE AMONGST THE POOREST OF THOSE THAT COME TO OUR RESOURCE CENTERS. AND THE COLORS PROGRAM IS JUST ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT THIS THAT OUR STATE HAS IN ADDRESSING DEEP POVERTY. BUT IT'S FLAWED AS YOU HEARD I'M BECAUSE INSTEAD OF ENCOURAGING FAMILIES TO SAVE RESOURCES AND GROW THEIR FINANCIAL STABILITY AND ACTUALLY DISCOURAGES EFFORTS TOWARD SELF SUFFICIENCY -- CURRENTLY THE COLOR EXTRA PROGRAM BASICALLY REQUIRES A FAMILY TO HAVE HIT ABSOLUTE ROCK BOTTOM. BEFORE THEY CAN GET REALLY MODEST. AMOUNTS OF AID AND FOOD BANKS ARE PART OF THE SAFETY NET THAT STOPS IN WHEN PEOPLE REALLY DON'T HAVE OTHER OPTIONS -- AND WHEN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE MEANT TO KICK IN IN THESE TIMES I HAVE FAILED THEM. I'M SO THE IDEA THAT FAMILIES ALREADY LIVING ON THE EDGE OF POVERTY OR DISCOURAGED OR EVEN PENALIZED FOR HAVING MODEST SAVINGS IS BOTH CRUEL ANYTHING COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. I AM SO THE COUNT THE CALORIES GRANTS ARE MEANT TO HELP FAMILIES GET BACK ON THEIR FEET AND IN ORDER TO STAY TRUE TO THAT MISSION -- WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO REPEAL THE ASSET TEST SO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS AS WELL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO ASK ABOUT THE WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY I'M ALSO THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE FOR THIS STATEWIDE CALIFORNIA ASSET BUILDING COALITION -- THAT'S ALSO IN SUPPORT. AS YOU HEARD THIS POLICY AT NOT ONLY DISCOURAGES SAVINGS. BUT IT SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE NOT JUST TAKE OUR SHE SAID PANTS BUT ALSO TO THE COMMUNITY. WE EVE YOU SEEN US IN BUDGET COMMITTEE YOU SEEN US AND POLICY COMMITTEE THAT -- TESTIFY TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE CAO WORKS RECEIVE JUST. NOT EVEN ENOUGH TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS. AND IT'S IT'S DEFINITELY OUR EXPERIENCE THAT THE ASSET TEST -- DOESN'T HURT MOST THE PEOPLE ON A BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO LITTLE. THEY CAN BARELY TAKE CARE OF WHAT THEY NEED TO PAY TODAY I AM NOT TO MENTION PUT AWAY SAVINGS BUT IT DOES HURT THE MOST BY THE APPLICANTS. NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF THE APPLICANTS COMING IN IT'S LESS THAN 1% OF APPLICANTS TO ACTUALLY END UP N -- BEING DENIED BENEFIT BECAUSE OF THIS ROLE. BUT A 100% OF THE APPLICANTS ACTUALLY HAVE TO SHOW THEIR PAPERWORK AND AND EITHER PROVE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ASSETS OR THAT THEIR ASSETS ARE LOW ENOUGH AND A 100% OF THE SOCIAL WORKERS. WHO RECEIVE THOSE APPLICANTS -- HAVE TO DO THE SAME AND THAT'S TIME AWAY FROM HELPING PEOPLE FIND HOMES HELPING THEM REMOVE BARRIERS TO WORK HELPING THEM APPLY FOR THEIR WELFARE TO WORK PLACEMENT. EVERY A 100% OF THE APPLICANTS HAVE TO GOING GET COPIES OF THE BANK STATEMENTS IF THEY DON'T HAVE A BANK STATEMENT THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO PROVE THEY DON'T HAVE A BANK STATEMENT. AGAIN -- YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT THE EFFICIENCIES THAT CAN BE GAINED BY REMOVING THE ASSET TEST AND THE HAVE BEEN GAINED IN STATES THAT HAVE DONE SO AND WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE EFFICIENCIES CAN BE PLOWED BACK INTO THE PROGRAM TO PROVIDE. BETTER SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE COMING IN AND APPLYING FOR ASSISTANCE AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO HIT THE FLOOR. BEFORE THEY GET A LITTLE HELP SO WITH THAT WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO STRENGTHEN OUR SAFETY NET AND AND SUPPORT FAMILIES WHO ARE COMING IN AND SEEKING AID -- ED IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN STABILITY THANKS. THANK YOU WILL NOW OPEN UP. TO PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS BILL DO WE HAVE ANY. ANYONE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MADAM CHIME FRANK MAKE IT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION ONE STRONG SUPPORT -- INCOME AND RESOURCES ARE WHAT PEOPLE NEED TO MOVE TO POVERTY IN OUR WORKERS AND MEMBERS OF RATHER SPEND TIME HELPING PEOPLE MOVE TOWARD SELF SUFFICIENCY GET JOBS. THAN CHASING PAPER THAT SUGGESTS SERVING TO IMPOVERISHED PEOPLE THANKS. AND JUST PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME IN ORDER SEVEN AS THE CHORUS A CALIFORNIA WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION STRONG SUPPORT. GEN AND CAL WORKS WITH STUDENTS WHO ARE ON WELFARE HAVE NORM LAST WEEK OF THE MONTH THEY STARVE THEY HAVE NOTHING TO SAVE. NOW AND THEN SOMEBODY MAKE IT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM A RELATIVE OR WHATEVER AND THEN THEY CUT THEM OFF TO HAVE JUST IT DOESN'T. DOESN'T MAKE SENSE SO WITH SUPPORTERS BUILDING -- CHILD JUST BILL YOUR RIGHTS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY I DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. HERBAL. I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST EVILS OF THE WORKS. SYSTEM -- SAID I NOTICES SEARCH STONE HAS TRIED TO DO WITH THIS I TRY TO DO IT WE WE WE'VE HAD A A PROBLEM IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEES. BECAUSE THEY DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT. ACTUALLY HELPING PEOPLE. CREATE OUT SAYS IS A GOOD THING I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM. I I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE METHODOLOGY OF THE APPROPRIATORS. IN CONCERN THAT CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT WHICH YEAH THIS IS. THIS IS LIKE A HISTORICAL PROBLEM WITH THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEES -- I AM I RIGHT AND CAN YOU COMMENT ON HOW WE CAN OVERCOME. AT THAT THIS INFORMATION I THINK THAT'S IN -- WHAT I CONSIDER A FAULTY WAY OF LOOKING AT? THIS ISSUE FROM THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEES. SENATE RECORD COMMON FOR A LENGTHY PERIOD OF TIME ABOUT THE APPROPRIATION PROCESS WE'VE WE ALWAYS HAVE PROBLEMS WE HAVE AND WE HAVE FAN. TASTIC CURRENT AND FORMER TEARS OF THE PROVISIONS COME TO YOU AND I OF COURSE FOR MEMBERS. OF THE COMMITTEE WITH INCREDIBLE STAFF BUT I I'M. YOU KNOW THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THINGS HAPPEN IN THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS THAT -- IT IT YOU KNOW -- TOM CLEAR WHY AND I THINK SOMETIMES WHENEVER YOU HAVE A BIG PRICE TAG. IT DOES -- IT'S THE DOLLARS BECAUSE FOCUS IN TERMS OF BEING HELD IN SUSPENSE -- SO I WE HAVE MADE A BUDGET REQUESTS I'M NOT GOING TO PUT THE CHAIR OF THAT BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE SPOT RIGHT NOW. THIS IS THE RIGHT HERE -- BUT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY MAKING A BUDGET REQUEST -- AND TRYING TO GET THIS FUNDED IN THE BUDGET AND IF THAT MEANS THAT THE BILL GETS ABSORBED INTO THE BUDGET -- I BE -- HAPPY TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN -- BUT WERE PRETTY DETERMINED TO TRY TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN THIS YEAR. HELLO MISS BARTOLO WOULD LIKE TO I DON'T. WHAT THE MISSION COMMON ABOUT? HOW COME WE'VE HAD HAVE THEY LOOKED AT IT WRONG IN TERMS OF THE WAY THE ANALYZE? THE THE COST I THINK IT SAVES MONEY WHEN YOU [inaudible] THE STATE. ALLOW SAVINGS THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE WE WANT. WE WANT -- TO ENCOURAGE CAL WORKS -- ORANGE TO HELP THEIR CHILDREN AND HAVE A WAY TO HAVE A TRANSPORTATION -- YEAH WILLIAMS SO LOOK FOR CENTER BELT THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA IN THE PAST AND PASS -- LEGISLATION. PROPOSALS -- YOU KNOW I THINK IN GENERAL THERE'S A A PROPENSITY TO TO SITE -- COST PRESSURES WE ALWAYS HEAR THIS THIS COST PRESSURES AS COST PRESSURES AND I ALWAYS. TRY TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THERE'S ALSO SAVINGS PRESSURES -- AND AND THE SAVINGS PRESSURES ON OFTEN GET IDENTIFIED IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE WHEN WE WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW IT WE WON'T HAVE TO SPEND SO MUCH ON HOMELESS ASSISTANCE IF FAMILIES CAN HAVE A LITTLE CUSHION. TO COVER THE RENT WHEN THEIR WAGES ARE SHORT. IF WE CAN LOOK AT THE SAVINGS PRESSURES. FOR THESE TYPES OF OF PROGRAMS FOR AND HOW THEY IMPACT LOW INCOME FAMILIES I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GREAT BENEFIT IN THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO JOIN US AND REQUESTING. THOSE KINDS OF CONSIDERATIONS. OR THROUGH THE BILL THANK YOU. SENATOR STONE AND THEN CENTER MAN THEY GIVE THEM CHAIR -- SENATOR WIENER -- THE ASSESSED VALUE OF MORE THAN NINETY FIVE HUNDRED WITH THE VEHICLE I SENATE'S THE NET VALUE -- OF THE VEHICLES IS BECAUSE I REPORTS HAS ASSESSED VALUE SO YOU CAN HAVE A NINETY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR VEHICLE BUT THE ONLY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON THE VEHICLE THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE DELTA THAT WERE. INGRATIATING THESE PEOPLE WITH RIGHT SO I SO IT'S NOT VALUE. THE CURRENT THE CURRENT -- PROPOSAL IS JUST TO REPEAL THE ASSET TEST AND THEY ASKED AND THE VEHICLE A TEST AS PART OF PART AND PARCEL OF THE ASSET TEST SO JUST REPEAL IT -- AND IT WOULD SAY WE'RE NOT GOING T GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE BLUE BOOK VALUE OF YOUR CAR. OR YOUR SYSTEM A LOT TODAY YEAH UNDER THE THE VALUES ASSESSED AT NINETY FIVE HUNDRED THE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE BALANCES OWED ON THAT IT'S JUST THE AMOUNT THAT YOU OWE WE ACTUALLY. CHANGE THAT LAW WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS AND A COUPLE OF BUDGETS AGO WHERE WE IT USED TO BE THAT THE VALUE OF THE CAR. TOTAL AND WE CHANGED IT TO BE -- JUST THE THE AMOUNT THE PERSON OLD IN THE VALUE. OF ENOUGH VALUE. OKAY. I THINK TELEVISION ABOUT IT YEAH IF I OKAY WHICH IS BETTER -- I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO -- I DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE DISCOURAGED FROM FROM SAVINGS AND TRYING TO LIFT THEMSELVES OUT OF A POVERTY -- I THINK THIS FORCES PEOPLE TO TO LIVE ON THE EDGE WHICH I THINK IS WRONG -- BUT AM I SAYING THIS IS GOING TO BE PREVALENT AMONG THIS POPULATION BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IF SOMEBODY COMES INTO AN INHERITANCE WE ARE IF I MENTION FIVE THOUSAND THAT'S NOT. AS MUCH MONEY AS I WAS THINKING SUMMIT IT A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR SHOULD THERE NOT BE SOME TEST. OF THEIR CASH ON HAND UNDER THE PENALTY OF PERJURY THEY DON'T HAVE TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS CASH ON HAND -- SO THAT. WE DON'T HAVE ANYBODY GAMING THE SYSTEM. I THINK IF YOU. IF YOU HAVE IF YOU COMING OF THAT LEVEL OR A HIGH LEVEL OF WEALTH. COULD BE THE CASE YOU'RE GONNA BE GENERATING INCOME. OFF OF THAT MOST LIKELY AND THAT INCOME MAY BY ITSELF. DISQUALIFY. FOR OVERLOOKED SAID EXTREME EXAMPLE AND IF SOMEONE HURTS MILLION DOLLARS YOU'RE PREGNANT URINE MAKING WAY TOO MUCH YOU CAN BE ONE OF THOSE OF ALL SOMEBODY AUGUSTINE THOUSAND DOLLARS TWENTY THOUSAND THE CAN INTO IT YOU KNW IT RATE TO THE BANK TODAY AT QUARTER PERCENT OR YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET THAT KIND OF MEN COMPRESSION I'M SORRY. DO WE NEED SOME KIND OF A ESTONIA TO MAKE SURE THAT. I GUESS HELPING ALL PEOPLE THAT REALLY NEED OUT I GUESS MY TAKE ON IT IF YOU US OF PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY WHO ARE ON CAL WORKS. AND LET'S SAY BEEN HURT FIFTEEN OR TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THAT'S MONEY BUT LET'S SAY THEY SAY PUT THAT IN SAVING SO KICKING A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR THEY CAN -- PAY SOME BILLS WITH THEIR BEHIND OR WHATEVER OR THEY JUST KEEP IN SAVINGS IN CASE THEY NEED A FOR RENT ONE DAY. I DON'T. THAT DOESN'T DOESN'T BOTHER ME AT ALL I THINK IF A NATURAL LIMIT IF YOU'RE. HAVING TO BE IN HURTING SO MUCH MONEY. THAT IT WOULD REALLY SEEM OBSCENE THEY'RE GONNA THE INTEREST ON THAT IS PROBABLY GOING TO DISQUALIFY THEM. FROM RECEIVING CAL WORKS -- SO I AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT. AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S BEEN NICK'S RAMPS AND OTHER STATES THAT DON'T HAVE TE ASSET TEST. ON BECAUSE FORTUNATELY EVEN. CALIFORNIA WE LIKE TO THINK OF OURSELVES ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF A LOT OF ISSUES BUT I'VE LEARNED SINCE COMING UP HERE THAT THERE A LOT OF ISSUES WERE WERE. LIGHTING OTHER STATES INCLUDING SOME RED STATES -- AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM AND SO FORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE TO BE THE TEST CASE WE KNOW HOW IT'S WORKED OTHER STATES AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S BEEN AN ISSUE. I WOULD JUST SAID THAT THE RESEARCH DOES BEAR THAT OUT THAT -- IN THE OTHER STATES TO HAVE PASSED AS THE TOWN OF ASSET TEST REPEALED THEY HAVE NOT HAVE EXPANSION IN THERE AT TEN OF POPULATION -- AND I WOULD ADD THAT PEOPLE -- PEOPLE WHO INHERIT A LOT OF WEALTH PROBABLY HAVE OTHER WAYS LIKE TAX CREDITS AND THINGS LIKE THAT TO TAKE A NOTE TO BENEFIT AT THIS AND WHEN YOU GO TO APPLY FOR PUBLIC BENEFITS YOU HAVE TO COMPLY WITH. THE WELFARE TO WORK RULES YOU HAVE TO IT A GIVE AWAY ALL THE INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR HOUSEHOLD YOUR PRIVACY THIS IS A VERY IT'S A IT'S A SYSTEM IN WHICH TO OPEN UP ALL YOUR VULNERABILITIES. AND SOMEBODY HAS EXTREME WEALTH THEY WERE NOT SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO THAT KIND OF SCRUTINY IN ORDER TO GET A COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS OF A MONTH THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER WAYS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS GIVING THEM AN EXTRA COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS A MONTH. WITH THAT KIND OF WEALTH -- AT AND FINALLY I WOULD SAY THIS POLICY IF PASSED A LINES ARE ASSET TEST WITH FEDERAL LAW. FOR CAL FRESH AND WITH FEDERAL LAW FOR MEDICARE MEDICARE RECIPIENTS HAT WITH CHILDREN ALSO HAVE WAIVED AS A TEST SO WE ALIGN ALL THREE PROGRAMS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CENTER PAN. THANK YOU AND SAID SHE CALLED ME ON THE FIGURED I THIS. IS NOT BY NAME NOW THAT IT AND I UNDERSTAND THIS IS -- THE IT DOES NOT APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT EVERY MEMBER OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ACTUALLY IS PRESENT RIGHT HERE -- THE BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU. AND I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE CROSSES OF NAY CROSS THE LINE TO THE MONEY SIDE BUT IT IS SO HOW MANY -- HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT TO GET EXCLUDED FROM THE ACID TEST? BIKE I MEAN -- SO I I CERTAINLY GET I GET THE POINT THAT IT COSTS TO STEAL OUR MONEY TO DO IT TO GO AND ASK THE QUESTIONS AND REQUIRE PEOPLE RIGHT PROOF AND ALL THIS OTHER STUFF. AND IN THE END AFTER WE PUT PEOPLE THROUGH THE RINGER FOR THAT HOW MANY PEOPLE DO WE SIMPLY SAVE UP TOO MUCH TOO BAD TO GO AND I REALIZE THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE MAYOR RIGHT NOW SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TRY BUT YOU KNOW I'M. I'M TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF LIKE FROM THAT HE SAID OTHER STATES TO TRY THIS EXACTLY HOW THE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT IT AT ALL -- I'LL ASK ON THIS PORTAL TO ANSWER THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION BUT I THINK THAT WHAT YOU JUST MENTIONED IS IS A BIGGER ISSUE -- IT'S IT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT WHO'S GETTING KICKED OFF IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE SAYING WELL I I BETTER NOT SAVE ANY MONEY OR GOING TO LOSE. MY BENEFITS IT WAS SORT OF THE MESSAGE THAT IT SENDS AND SO THE BABY THEY NEVER GET HER TALKED BUT THEY'RE NOT SAVING MONEY. AND AND IT'S IN OUR LETTER OF SUPPORT BUT IT THAT THE THE EXTENSIVE RESEARH ON THIS TOPIC -- BUT LOOK BUT YOU'RE LOOKING AT LESS THAN 1% OF THE APPLICANTS -- THE WORK OF 100% OF APPLICANTS WITH LESS THAN 1% ACTUALLY EVER BEING DENIED ON THE CURRENT NOW WITH THE CURRENT -- LAW SO SO I'M JUST A YEAR AND THE THINKING ABOUT EVEN ON THE MONEY SIDE REALIZING THIS THE POLICY COMMITTEE BUT BUT SINCE YOU REFERENCE THE BUDGET -- T A PART OF ME IS THIS THINKING LIKE WELL THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'RE SAVING. BY. DECREASING THE OVERHEAD IN THE PROCESS. IS THAT I MEAN AND HOW THAT COMPARES WITH DID NOT OF QUOTE MONEY THAT WE'RE GONNA SPEND EXTRA BECAUSE WE'VE INCREASES OUR CASELOAD I GUESS THAT'S GONNA BE I MEAN OF WHAT WHAT'S GENERATING THE EXPENSE. IN THIS BILL I MEAN I RELIZE THIS IS. THAT'S FRIES THAT THAT'S A LITTLE MAYBE A LITTLE MORE PREP SITE QUESTION BUT AND YOU KNOW BUT I'M JUST THE END AND I THINK PART OF THESE GOING LIKE WELL IT'S ONLY 1% HOW MANY MORE HOW MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE COULD THIS BE TO DO THIS BILL THEN. THE NOT RIGHT AND HOW THE WORD IS APPROPRIATIONS PEOPLE EQUITY HOW DID HOW COME HOW DID THEY SAY WHY DO THEY SEE THIS EXPENSIVE. SO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT LIKE A MEGA EXPENSIVE I AM I'M ASKING SIGNED THE LETTER I THINK IT WAS GOING ON ALRP [inaudible] EIGHT MILLION. OKAY -- IT'S IT'S I DON'T THINK IT'S A MEGA EXPENSE BUT OF COURSE THE WAY THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS WORKS IS. YOU KNOW YOU IT EVEN IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAVE MORE THAN YOU SPEND THAT DOESN'T TAKE YOU OUT. OF SECONDS RIGHT ALL RIGHT WELL WELL WELL AS IT SINCE THERE'S A BUDGET REQUEST OF BE INTERESTED LOOKING AT BOTH SIDES OF THAT. WE DID THAT THANK YOU YOU CENTER CONSIDER JACKSON. THANK YOU -- HI. I APPRECIATED WE'RE TALKING THE POTENTIAL FOR ABUSES TO MINIMUS BUT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES ALL TEXAS AT ONE BAD EXAMPLE AND THEN SUDDENLY A PROGRAM IS UNDERMINED -- AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT EITHER SO I'M WONDERING -- IS THERE SOME KIND OF ON GOING BASIS SO IN OTHER WORDS TO FIGHT -- DISCOVER I HAVE A REACHING OUT. OF BECAUSE I'VE JUST INHERITED. A LET'S SEE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LET'S SAY A HOUSE -- IS THERE SOMETHING UNDER EXISTING CAL WORKS RULES THAT REQUIRES IF I WERE TO COME INTO SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT I WOULD HAVE TO REPORT IT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE IF THAT'S THE CASE HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THIS. I DON'T MY TWENTY THOUSAND I DON'T MIND. THIRTY BUT I'M THE WORD TO AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE THE PEOPLE WHO GET TO TAKE TAX CREDITS AND WHAT HAVE YOU THE THOSE PEOPLE I'M NOT AT ALL CONCERNED BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT PEOPLE WHO IN SOME POINT. FIND THAT THEY GET TO COME INTO SOME LEVEL OF I WILL CALL IT WEALTH BUT SOME LEVEL OF THE THAT YOU KNOW BENEFIT. THAT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH THAT IT MIGHT. HAVE AFFECTED THEIR CAL WORKS IF THEY YOU HAD REPORTED. WELL I I THINK THAT IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THE LET'S SAY. FIFTY THOUSAND A SOME MAY HAVE SOME POINT AGAIN THAT THE INCOME THAT YOU'RE EARNING FROM THAT WEALTH IS GOING TO DISQUALIFY YOU FROM. FROM CAL WORKS AND I I ALSO I DO AGREE WITH THE WITHIN PARCEL OF THAT. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RECEIVING A PRETTY MODEST AMOUNT OF MONEY CAL WORKS IS NOT IN ARE NOT RECEIVING A LOT OF MONEY PER MONTH -- INTO THAT THE AYE I THINK IT WOULD BE. REALLY REALLY EXCEPTIONAL THAT SOMEONE HAS COME INTO SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY SO LET ME GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE ALL RIGHT LET'S ASSUME AS HYPOTHETICAL THAT SOMEONE COMES INTO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM AN UNCLE THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT. THERE ON CAL WORKS TODAY OF ANY ROUTE LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY TO REPORT THAT MONEY. UNDER THIS BILL NOW. TODAY HAVE HOWEVER IF THEY PUT INTO AN ACCOUNT AND THEY DREW DOWN THE MONEY ON A MONTHLY BASIS TO PAY THEIR BILLS IT WOULD IT WOULD BE COUNTED UNDER CURRENT LAW AS INCOME SO IF THE MONEY SAT IN THE ACCOUNT IF THIS BILL PASSED. ON THE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AT THE COUNT THEY DIDN'T TOUCH IT THEY COULDN'T USE IT. BUT IF THE BUT YOU KNOW IT WITH THAT CONTINUE TO RECEIVE AID BUT IF IT IF THEY DO THAT MONEY DOWN -- AT AND MORE THAN OCE THEN THEY WOULD END UP HAVING TO COUNT AS INCOME. UNDER UNDER THE LAW CURRENTLY AND IF PASSED RESOURCES DRAWN DOWN -- FROM AN ACCOUNT ON A REGULAR BASIS COUNT NOT ONLY FOR FOR AT CAL EXPENDABLE ALSO FOR COVERAGE BENEFITS -- SO SO THAT HAVE HAD A SELF REPORT I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE THE AT TWO UNDER CURRENT LAW THEY GOT THE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS -- AND I YOU KNOW I JUST HAS A LIKE LACKEY THEM FOR THEIR UNCLE ACTUALLY MY UNCLES AT WHAT THEY LEAVE ME IS NOT ANY OF THAT -- BUT IF THEY I'M HAPPY TO BE IN ADOPTED. BUT LET'S ASSUME THAT HAPPENS THAT IF THEY GET INSTANCE WHERE DOES AND SUDDENLY OKAY THING WILL BE SO IF THEY GOT THEY GOT THE MONEY TODAY THAT HAVE TO REPORTED TODAY -- AS AN ASSET AND IT WOULD MAKE THEM ELIGIBLE IMMEDIATELY BUT IF THEY GOT IT AND IF THIS BILL PASSED AND THEY GOT THE MONEY THEY WOULDN'T REPORT IT AS AN ASSET THE MINUTE THEY STARTED DRYING IT DOWN TO USE IT THEY HAVE TO REPORT IT AS INCOME -- AND AND THAT INCOME WOULD HAVE TO BECOME A INCLUDE SOUNDS AND CAL WORKS OR SNAP. HOW FASHION COLORS AND SO THAT MY HOPE YOU YEAH IT DOES A YEAR JUST THERE HAS TO BE SOME? SOME PROTECTION THERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW I DON'T HEAR THE WORD WELFARE QUEEN ONE MORE TIME AND YOU KNOW. THAT WHAT THE IF YOU. IF EVERYTHING IS SO OPEN AND NINETY NINE POINT 9% OF PEOPLE ARE FOLLOWING THE RULES IT'S THAT ONE TENTH 1% THAT HURT YOU AND SO I WILL I AM HOPING WE DON'T REALLY HAVE AN ENDO AND THE OTHER STATES TO DO THIS THIS IS NOT BEEN. AN ISSUE SO THAT I CAN ALWAYS BE EXTREME SITUATION. WELL IT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE SO THERE HAS TO BE THERE IS A REPORTING MECHANISM IN ALL UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE BILL. NOT CONTINUE THAT TRADITION AS WATER BELGIUM FOR THE CRIMES. THAT THE THE TYPE OF AREAS WHERE YOU COULD SAVE IS -- IS IN TERMS OF THE SIMPLIFICATION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. IS IT BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CAL WORKS PROCESS THE CAL FRESH PROCESS SO. I THINK -- CHILD CHILD CARE. PROGRAMS YOU WANT TO HAVE THE ELIGIBILITY PROCESS BE ALL THE SAY. AND THAT'S WHAT THE BILL. DOES THAT WHEN THEY HAVE TO THE ELIGIBILITY WORKER AT THE COUNTY WHEN THEY HAVE TO GO BACK AND CHECK ASSETS AND DO ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF. IT'S ADDED COST IT COSTS MORE MONEY IT'S CUMBERSOME AND YOU'RE DOING IT FOR A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMPARED TO CAL FRESH OR CAL. YEAH -- MEDI CAL. SO THE MEDICARE POPULATION IS WAY OVER WHAT TWELVE THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE THE HELL FRESH WATER WITHOUT. FIVE MILLION. FOUR MILLION AND AND AND CAL WORKS. HOW MANY APPLICATIONS IN CALIFORNIA? THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION. SO SO FOR ME TO MAKES THIS PROGRAM CONSISTENT [inaudible] WITH [inaudible] EVERYTHING. AND HAVE A SIMPLIFIED APPLICATION PROCESS IS A THE GOAL TO SAVE MONEY AND WOULD SAVE MONEY SO I THINK THE BILL WOULD ACTUALLY. SAVE MONEY ON THE THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSING OF OF THIS PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE OTHER PROGRAMS YOU WOULD HAVE. TO BE ABLE TO GET A LOT MORE WORK DONE. WITHOUT HAVING. TO GO THROUGH IS CUMBERSOME ASSET. TEST THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU CENTER ANY FURTHER COMMENTS. IT'S NOT WHICH I CALL CENTER IN. THIS REQUEST RIVALS. OKAY THIS IS -- GONNA BE GOING WHERE NEXT. TO A CORPORATION TO A MOTION. THE BILL SENATOR PAN AS MOVE THE BILL TO APPROPRIATIONS IF YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. HURTADO STONE NO STONE NO. BELL BELL I JACKSON. JACKSON AYE PAN HI CAN AYE WIENER. WIENER HI. FOUR ONE FOUR ONE WAY TO KEEP THE ROLE OF THE SENATOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. SENATOR PAN SP. FOUR TO ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- CALIFORNIA'S HOME TO OVER NINE MILLION CHILDREN AND WHILE CHILD WELFARE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PRIORITY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE STILL HAVE THEM ON THE WORST OUTCOME FOR CHILDREN HEALTH EDUCATION JUVENILE DOES JUSTICE. FOR EXAMPLE CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTY FIRST IN FOR PUPILS -- FOR STUDENTS SPENDING WE RANK FORTY THIRD FOR THE RATE OF YOUNG KIDS RECEIVING THE VOLATILE SCREENINGS. ALTHOUGH HELPED CHANGE THAT AND HALF OF KIDS IN CALIFORNIA FOSTER CARE HAVE ENTERED FOR MORE CHILDHOOD ADVERSE EXPENSE OURS AMAZED AS ACES WHICH ARE MORE LIKELY TO LEAD TO CHRONIC DISEASE IN ADULTHOOD -- WE DO HAVE MULTIPLE STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS PROVIDING DIRECT SERVICES THAT AIM TO ALLEVIATE THESE CHALLENGES AND YET -- WE'VE HAD SOME CHALLENGES IN TRYING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE THESE MEASURES OF CHILD WELL BEING. A AYE CHILDREN'S CABINET MADE OF QUE AGENCY LEADERS CAN HELP MOBILIZE EFFORTS AND RESOURCES AROUND STATE PRIORITIES FOR CHILDREN IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND STATE DELIVERY ACROSS THE STATE AND LOCAL DEPARTMENTS. AS BEFORE TWENTY ONE WOULD ESTABLISH THE CHILDREN'S CABINET TO DEVELOP A SHARED VISION AMONG THE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND OR TO IMPROVE CHILD AND FAMILY OUT COMES IN CALIFORNIA. THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION CONSIDERS CHILDREN'S CABINETS A EST PRACTICE AS SET FORTH GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR ESTABLISHING A CHILDREN'S CABINET. I LOOK FORWARD TO USE THAT BY USING THESE GUIDING PRINCIPLES A WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO REFINE THE CHILLS CABINET SPECIFIC GOALS TIMELINE TO MEMBERSHIP IN ORDER. TO ENSURE ITS SUCCESS AND CERTAINLY AS MENTIONED DEAL AS A CHAIR OF A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES I THINK WE SEE ALL THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND WE NOTICED SOMETIMES THE SILOS THEY TEND TO RESIDE IN. AND SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO AGAIN TRY TO BRIDGE THOSE SILOS AND HAVE AN ORGANIZATION WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION THAT WILL DO HIGH LEVEL BUT COORDINATED EFFORTS TO HELP IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR PENNED UP WE HAVE INDEED -- TESTIMONY IN FAVOR PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON DANIEL KENDO KAISER ON BEHALF OF COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK. VIDEO BORN AMERICAN CANYON PEDIATRICS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME FORWARD. IF NOT IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO SB FOUR TWENTY ONE PLEASE COME FORWARD. SIGNAL COME BACK TO OUR FELLOW SENATORS -- A MOTION -- QUESTION. SENATOR JACKSON YEAH I I THINK THIS IS A FASCINATING DEA -- IN AND APPRECIATE THE OUR RESIDENTS -- PEDIATRICIAN. RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE HERE OF HAVING A SOME KIND OF RECOGNITION OF SORT OF THE CONTINUUM WHICH IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE HERE -- I'M WONDERING HOW COULD YOU KIND OF SURE HOW YOU ENVISION THIS HAPPENING. WELL I I THINK THAT -- WE WE DO HAVE A I THINK THE IDEA IS IS THAT -- WE HAVE THE SENIOR LEADERSHIP AND THE VARIOUS AGENCIES THAT TOUCH CHILDREN. AND AND THE IDEA IS IS THAT -- THAT. THAT HOPEFULLY THEY CAN -- THEY WOULD BE SORT OF THE PLACE WHERE AT THE ADMINISTRATION CAN THINK STRATEGICALLY AND THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN CROSS THOSE DIFFERENT SILAS BECAUSE I THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT YOU HAVE DIFFERENT SALAS SO. I USED TO CHAIR SELECT ME ACCIONES SPECIAL NEEDS AND THAT WE HAVE. EDGE SPECIAL ED WAS AN EDUCATION RIGHT AND THEN WE HAD DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES WAS A AND AND AND AND SOCIAL SERVICES AND THEN YOU HAVE -- THAT IT YOU KNOW THE HEALTH AND THE MENTAL HEALTH AND AND AND AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU HAVE THINGS FRAGMENT ACROSS DIFFERENT -- AGENCIES IN FACT ACTUALLY INTERESTING ENOUGH WE HAD ONE OF OUR FIRST HEARINGS -- I WAS OUT SAY THAT MOST OF THE TIME THEY HAD ME TALK TO EACH OTHER AS A FIRST TIME THEY HEARD FROM EACH OTHER WHAT EACH OF THEM WERE DOING FOR PHYSICALLY CHILDREN'S SPECIAL NEEDS SELF BUT GIVEN THAT BUT FIRST SELECT COMMITTEE WAS ABOUT. I THINK WE NEED THIS -- LARGER OWES A WE HAVE THINGS LIKE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL OTHER TYPES OF BODIES WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION THAT BEEN PLACE TO LOOK STRATEGICALLY ACROSS -- THINGS AND I THINK WE NEED ONE FOR CHILDREN SPECIFICALLY AND CERTAINLY HOPE THAT -- WITH THIS -- BILL WELL WELL -- PROMPT THAT KIND OF DISCUSSION AND ALSO LEAD TO EVENTUALLY I AN ORGANIZATION WE WILL WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL ON ON THIS SO -- AS THE BILL WAS FORCED. IF I MAY ONE OTHER QUESTION IS I DON'T RECALL SEEING ARE THERE ANY OTHER STATES THAT HAVE DONE ANYTHING SIMILAR TO THIS. ARE THERE ARE OTHER STATES THAT THE HAVE A CHILDREN'S CABINETS AND AS I MENTIONED IT'S CONSIDERED A BEST PRACTICE BY THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION -- SO THAT IT SO THERE AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE OTHER OTHER STATES THAT HAVE JONES CABINETS CENTER IS THIS MODELED AFTER THE MORE WOULD THIS BE UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA. WELL I THINK WE ARE LOOKING AT USING THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION OF BEST PRACTICES AS A GUIDANCE TO THE DEVELOPMENT THIS OF COURSE AGAIN WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE CURRENT MINISTRATION WHICH WHO HAS EXPRESSED A TREMENDOUS INTEREST IN CHILDREN. AND IN SHAPING IT IN A WAY THAT BEST MEETS THE NEEDS OF OF CALIFORNIA IT'S AMAZING WHAT HAPPENS FROM THE GOVERNOR HAS FOR LITTLE CHILDREN TEN YEARS OF AGE AND UNDER. THE KIND OF CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES CAN THEY YES. WELL THAT'S A GOOD THING THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER ON LIKE YOUR BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITH MOTION BY SENATOR JACKSON IN THE FOR QUESTIONS. IF NOT THOUGH WE'RE GONNA CALL THE ROLL THIS IS GOING TO WEAR. MOTION IS TO PASS TO GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE OKAY. THIS CALL A HELLO STONE BY STONE AYE BELL. BELL I JACKSON. JACKSON AYE PAN HI CAN I WIENER RIGHT WIENER AYE. AS FIVE ZERO FIVE ZERO FIVE ZERO IN ON THE ROLE OF AN CENTER AND THANK YOU FOR GRADUATION. AND THE OTHER BILL HAS A SECOND BILL. VIOLENT TEMPER SB FIVE ONE TWO YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SHARE OF OYSTER MEMBERS -- FOR THE SAKE PERCENT SB FIVE TWELVE AND I THINK OF WHICH TAKES THE FIRST CRITICAL STEP TO CREATING A NEW LONG TERM. SERVICES AND SUPPORTS OUR L. TSS BENEFIT FOR CALIFORNIA. THE NEED FOR THIS LEGISLATION THIS NEW BENEFIT IS URGENT ALMOST EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER OLDER ADULTS ARE INDIVIDUALS WITH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DISABILITIES CURRENTLY LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS POPULATION WILL GROW SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE NEXT DECADE. UNFORTUNATELY MEDI CAL. UNFORTUNATELY MANY CALIFORNIANS LACK ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE L. D. S. A SERVICES. LONG TERM SUPPORT SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ARE NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED BY MEDICARE AND MISS CALIFORNIANS CANNOT AFFORD TO PURCHASE PRIVATE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE. PAYING OUT OF POCKET FOR LTE ASSESSES HOW EXPENSIVE INCREASE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL SOCIAL BURDEN FOR FAMILIES. ALTERNATIVELY AND FORTUNATELY THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST FREQUENT -- SCENARIO CALIFORNIANS MUST SPEND DOWN THROUGH THEIR LIFE SAVINGS TO BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE. AND TO OFFER THIS IS THE PRIMARY MEANS BY WHICH OLDER ADULTS AND INDIVIDUALS DISABILITIES CURLY RECEIVE ACCESS TO PAY LONG TERM SUPPORT SIR AND SERVICES. MEDI CAL IS A CRITICAL SAFETY NET BUT THE SYSTEM IS OVERBURDENED. INDIVIDUAL SHOULD HAVE TO IMPOVERISH THEMSELVES A SPEND THEIR LIFE SAVINGS AND OUR CHILDREN'S INHERITANCE OR FORGO WORKING AND GENERATING EARNED INCOME. IN ORDER TO ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THEY NEED TO LIVE INDEPENDENT HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE. THIS LEGISLATION IS CREATING A FRAMEWORK FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF A LONG TERM. OF A LONG TERM SERVICE OF THE SUPPORTS BENEFIT TO BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS SPECIFICALLY SB FIVE TWELVE CREATES THE INFRASTRUCTURE MODELED AFTER DE CAL SEAVER SECURE CHOICE PROGRAM. FOR WHEN CALIFORNIA'S REDESIGNED AND FINANCE THIS NEW BENEFIT INDEED THE LEGISLATION SPONSORED BY CALIFORNIA AGING AND DISABILITY ALLIANCE WHICH REPRESENTS TWENTY ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF L. D. S. A STAKEHOLDERS. WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD NOW TO PUT THESE CRITICAL PIECES IN PLACE SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD WITH BENEFIT FINANCING DECIDE. SO -- THAT I'D HAVE -- MANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT HERE AND I APPRECIATE THEIR PATIENCE. IN WAITING AT TO THE VERY END OF THE HEARING AND I HOPE THAT HAVE YOUR AYE VOTES NOT WHEN WE CONCLUDE THANK YOU.

TSS COST -- MORE THAN MOST CALIFORNIA'S CAN AFFORD. A A RP RESEARCH FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN SHOW THAT THE AVERAGE ANNUAL COST OF NURSING HOME CARE IS ABOUT DOUBLE. THE MEDIAN INCOME FOR OLDER HOUSEHOLDS. BOB ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN THOUSAND PER YEAR FOR A PRIVATE ROOM AND NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR SHARED FROM. HIRING A HOME CARE PROVIDER AND THIS IS SOMETHING I'M NOT FAMILIAR ABOUT BECAUSE OF MY MOM -- COSTS FOR THIRTY HOURS A WEEK BECAUSE BETWEEN230-002-40000 DOLLARS A YEAR DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE SPENDING ON LOCATION. MOST FAMILY SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD THIS IN FACT ONLY 5% OF CALIFORNIANS. 5%. WERE ABLE -- TO PURCHASE LONG TERM CARE POLICY. SB FIVE ONE TWO IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO ME PERSONALLY. I LOST BOTH MY FATHER AND MY MOTHER IN LAW LAST YEAR. AND OUR FAMILY SPENT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OUT OF POCKET. THE TAKE CARE OF OUR PARENTS. WE ALSO HAVE A HAD TO TAKE TIME OFF FROM WORK.

THE HER A TO SECURE HER IN HOME SERVICES. FELL BECAUSE OF THESE EXPERIENCES I BECAME AN A. R. P.. A. R. P. VOLUNTEER. I HOPE FOR A TIME WHEN FAMILIES WILL HAVE BETTER OPTIONS.

HELLO GOOD EVENING MY NAME'S KRISTINA MILLS AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS WE ARE STRONG SUPPORTER OF SB FIVE ONE TWO AND DAD MEMBER AT THE CALIFORNIA AGING AND DISABILITY ALLIANCE. WHICH I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT IS VERY UNIQUELY POSITIONED IN WORKING WITH PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ACROSS THE LIFESPAN AS WELL AS THE AGENT COMMUNITY TO PUSH SB FIVE ONE TWO FORWARD. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY AS A MEMBER OF THE SACRAMENTO COMMUNITY WHO LIKE ME WAS BORN WITH A DISABILITY AND HAS HAD TO MAKE SOME DIFFICULT CHOICES BECAUSE OF L. TSS SERVICES THAT ARE AND ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO THOSE WITH DISABILITIES [inaudible] WELCOME. GOOD EVENING SENATORS -- AS MENTIONED MY NAME IS KIM LATER UP I AM THIRTY THREE YEARS OLD AND I LIVE WITH A DISABILITY. I WAS BORN WITHOUT ARMS AND LEGS. I ALSO AM BORN AND RAISED HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND I'M A REGISTERED VOTER. I HAVE ALSO BEEN RECEIVING LONG TERM SUPPORTS AND SERVICES SINCE I WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. I'D LIKE TO THANKYOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE SENATE BILL. FIVE TWELVE EVER SINCE I WAS YOUNG I WAS ALWAYS TOLD THAT WORKING FULL TIME AND KEEPING MY LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS IS JUST NOT REALISTIC. HEARING THIS CREATED THE DESIRE WITHIN ME TO WANT TO WORK FULL TIME EVEN MORE. I WANTED TO COME HOME AT NIGHT pMY PART IN CONTRIBUTING AND GIVING BACK TO MY COMMUNITIES. BUT THEN I ALSO DID MY PART AS A TAX PAYING AMERICAN TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR COUNTRY. IF YOU YEARS AGO MY DREAM BECAME A REALITY WHEN I WAS OFFERED MY VERY FIRST INTERNSHIP. SHORTLY AFTER MY INTERNSHIP TURNED INTO A PART TIME JOB. AND EVENTUALLY I WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK FULL TIME. IT WAS A DIFFICULT DECISION FOR ME TO MAKE HOWEVER BECAUSE I KNEW THERE WAS ONLY SO MUCH INCOME I COULD EARN. IN ORDER TO KEEP MY LONG TERM SUPPORTS AND SERVICES. NONETHELESS I OPTIMISTICALLY MOVED FORWARD ALWAYS MAKING SURE THAT I NEVER WENT OVER THE INCOME THRESHOLD. AS TO NOT JEOPARDIZE MY LONG TERM SUPPORTS AND SERVICES. BUT IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN MY FATHER PASSED AWAY. AND I BEGAN RECEIVING HIS SOME OF HIS BENEFITS. THIS MEANT THERE WAS NO WAY I COULD KEEP MY EARNED INCOME. AND MY LONG TERM SUPPORT AND SERVICES. IN THAT MOMENT I WAS FACED WITH A CHOICE. TO EITHER LOSE MY PERSONAL SERVICES WHICH CONSISTS OF MY HEALTH CARE AND MY PERSONAL CARE ATTENDANTS. THAT ENABLES ME TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY. OR I WOULD HAVE TO QUIT MY JOB. A JOB THAT I WORKED SO HARD. FOR A JOB THAT I WAS GROWING MY SKILLS IN. AND WHERE I WAS BUILDING MY COMMUNITY AND NETWORK THROUGH. I FELT HEARTBROKEN THAT I WAS FORCED TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING THAT I WORKED SO HARD. FOR AND I WAS ALSO DISAPPOINTED TO KNOW THAT I WAS GOING TO BE KEPT ON GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE. AND THAT I WAS GENERALLY JUST TAKING A STEP BACKWARDS IN MY LIFE. BUT THERE'D BE NO WAY I COULD AFFORD OUT OF POCKET COSTS WITH HEALTH CARE ON MY EARNED INCOME ALONE. SO I DID QUIT MY JOB. JUST TO MAINTAIN LIVING IN MY HOME AND LIVING INDEPENDENTLY. I AM NOT ALONE THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WERE FORCED TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS EVERY DAY. WHETHER WE CHOOSE TO PURSUE JOBS CAREERS AND EARN INCOME. OR KEEP THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT ALLOWS US TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY IN OUR OWN HOMES. THIS DECISION IS NOT FAIR AND IT'S ALWAYS PLACED ON PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WITH YOUR SUPPORT OF SB FIVE TWELVE THERE WILL BE MORE OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF. WHO SO THAT THEY WILL NOT BE FORCED INTO THESE UNFAIR SITUATIONS? WITH SB FIVE TWELVE THERE WILL BE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO BE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO PURSUE A CAREER WITHOUT RISKING OUR SERVICES. SERVICES THAT WE NEED IN ORDER% TO LIVE THE LIFE WE DESERVE. TO LIVE SAFELY AND INDEPENDENTLY AND OUR OWN HOMES AND WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WE APPRECIATE IT.
