SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS HAVE A HIGHLIGHTED WHAT ATHLETES CAN ACCOMPLISH INSTEAD OF WHAT THEY CANNOT. IT FOCUSES ON HOW OUR DIFFERENCES CAN BRING US TOGETHER INSTEAD OF DIVIDING US. THROUGH EVENTS THAT ARE HELD YEAR ROUND INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL PHYSICAL DISABILITIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO COMPETE IN A WIDE RANGE OF ATHLETIC ENDEAVOR SUPPORTED BY. VOLUNTEERS FRIENDS AND FAMILY. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SUMMER GAMES JUST CONCLUDED -- THIS LAST WEEKEND AND SAW SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY ATHLETES WITH TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE COACHES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ALONE. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS AS FAR MORE THAN JUST REFINED PHYSICAL SKILLS. IT HAS BEEN PROVEN TO HELP THE MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL BEING OF THE ATHLETES INCLUDING PROVIDING NEW SOCIALIZATION OPPORTUNITIES EDUCATIONAL EQUITY. I CREATING BASS TO BEHAVIORAL BENEFITS. THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN A VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITY OR SOMETHING TO DO ON WEEKENDS IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE THE LIVES OF NEARLY. SIX HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND HOW WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IN OUR STATE. IT'S BEEN AN HONOR TO ADVOCATE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE TOO OFTEN FORGOTTEN SACRAMENTO. AND I'LL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THESE MEMBERS OF ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES FOR AS LONG AS I'M HERE. AS YOU WORK TOWARD THE GOOD OF ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS LET'S REMEMBER TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER BY LOOKING FOR THE LONELY ISOLATED.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN A FOUR YEAR OLD BOY A SOUGHT DAMAGES BECAUSE HE SUFFERED NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE AFTER LIVING IN APARTMENT ILLEGALLY COATED WITH LEAD PAINT. WHILE THE BOYS ATTORNEYS ESTIMATED HE SHOULD BE AWARDE THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS THE AMOUNT HE WOULD HAVE EARNED OVER HIS LIFETIME THE LANDLORDS ATTORNEYS ARGUED HE SHOULD ONLY BE AWARDED ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. BECAUSE AS A LATINO HE WAS UNLIKELY TO ATTAIN THE ADVANCE EDUCATION THAT WAS TO GARNER THE LARGER INCOME. THIS PRACTICE IS UNCONSCIONABLE INDIVIDUAL SHOULD NOT BE VALUED BASED ON IMMUTABLE CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS RACE OR GENDER. YEAH UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING TO PLAINTIFFS IN CALIFORNIA COURTROOMS. BECAUSE WOMEN AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS AND OTHERS BURN LESS ON AVERAGE THAN THEIR WHITE AND MALE COUNTERPARTS THE DAMAGES THEY CAN RECEIVE IN THESE LAWSUITS CAN BE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER. SB FORTY ONE WOULD MAKE OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM MORE FAIR BY PUTTING AN END TO THE WIDESPREAD PRACTICE USED BY LEGAL DEFENSE TEAMS TO SHORT CHANGE PLAINTIFFS. IN PERSONAL INJURY AND WRONGFUL DEATH CASES BASED ON RACE AND GENDER. IN THESE CASES JUDGES AND JURIES RELY ON CALCULATION TABLES THAT ECONOMISTS USE TO PROTECT THE PLAINTIFFS LOST EARNINGS AND WAGES BASED ON FEDERAL STATISTICS THAT BREAK DOWN FUTURE EARNINGS ALONG RACE IN GENERAL LINES. ALL CALIFORNIA PLAINTIFFS DESERVE TRUE JUSTICE ALL CALIFORNIANS TO SERVICE STATE THE DON'T LET THE COURTS VALUE PEOPLE BASED ON THE GENDER ON THEIR GENDER OR THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN.

FOR SB THIRTY SENATE BILL THIRTY EXPANDS CALIFORNIANS OPTIONS TO ENTER INTO LEGALLY PROTECTED RELATIONSHIPS BY REMOVING THE GENDERED REQUIREMENTS OF COUPLES WHO WISH TO BECOME PARTNERS. CURRENTLY TO REGISTER AS A DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE. A COUPLE MUST EITHER BE SAME SEX OR OPPOSITE SEX IF ONE PARTNER IS OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY TWO THE HISTORICAL REASON FOR THIS IS BECAUSE LGBT Q. COUPLES COULD NOT PREVIOUSLY GOT MARRIED. SO THEY WERE GIVEN THE OPTION TO REGISTER AS DOMESTIC PARTNERS OLDER OPPOSITE SEX COUPLES WERE ALSO GIVEN THIS PRIVILEGE BECAUSE OF SOCIAL SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS. AND BECAUSE OLDER COUPLES MORE FREQUENTLY LIVE ON A FIXED INCOME. NOW WE CAN FORTUNATELY ALL GET MARRIED AND WE SHOULD ALL ALSO BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO A DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP IF WE SO CHOOSE. IN MODERN LIFE PEOPLE MAKE ALL SORTS OF THE RELATIONSHIP CHOICES REFLECTING THEIR VALUES COMMITMENTS AND LONG TERM PLANS. SB THIRTY REMOVES DISCRIMINATORY BARRIERS FOR COUPLES WHO WISH TO BE CALM DOMESTIC PARTNERS IN RECOGNIZES AND RESPECTS THEIR RIGHT TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN DEFINITION OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP. NOT EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA WANTS TO BE MARRIED BUT MANY DO YOU WANT THEIR RELATIONSHIPS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO BE RECOGNIZED AND TO HAVE LEGAL PROTECTIONS.

SENATE BILL TWO THIRTY THREE BY SENATOR WIENER AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY TO CRIME [inaudible] MEMBERS. THESE THE RETENTION IS KAMLAGER-DOVE YOU MAY OPEN MEMBERS I RISE TODAY AS A CO AUTHOR TO PRESENT S. B. TWO THREE THREE BY SENATOR WIENER. THIS BILL IMPROVES THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF SEX WORKERS BY PROHIBITING THE ARREST OF AN INDIVIDUAL FOR MISDEMEANOR PROSTITUTION RELATED CRIMES WHEN THEY COME FORWARD TO REPORT THEMSELVES THE VICTIM OR WITNESS. OF SPECIFIED VIOLENT CRIMES. SB TWO THREE THREE ALSO ENSURES THAT THE POSSESSION OF CONDOMS MAY NOT BE USED AS EVIDENCE TO ARREST TO PROSECUTE SOMEONE FOR PROSTITUTION RELATED CRIMES. THE CRIMINALIZATION OF PROSTITUTION HAS HAD DEVASTATING AFFECTS ON SEX WORKERS WHETHER THEY ARE SELLING BY CHOICE CIRCUMSTANCE OR BY FORCE. AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THIS CRIMINALIZATION ALL SEX WORKERS ARE VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIMES AND A DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH RATES. OVER 60% OF ALL SEX WORKERS HAVE BEEN VIOLENTLY OR SEXUALLY ASSAULTED WHILE WORKING. IN ORDER TO APPREHEND THESE DANGEROUS CRIMINALS AND RAPISTS THAT ARE PREYING ON THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION WE MUST PRIORITIZE THE SAFETY OF SEX WORKERS. OVER CRIMINALIZING THEM SO THAT THEY CAN FEEL SAFE ENOUGH TO REPORT THESE VIOLENT CRIMES WITHOUT FEAR THAT THEY WILL IN TURN BE ARRESTED FOR PROSECUTE XIN. THE PROSECUTION AND PROSTITUTION ALL THESE PEAS. CONDOMS WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND HELP STOP THE SPREAD OF INFECTION ARE STILL USED AS A TOOL TO CRIMINALIZE SEX WORKERS BY USING THEM AS EVIDENCE WHEN PROSECUTING SOMEONE FOR SEX WORK. WE NOW HAVE REPORTS WHERE TRAFFICKERS IN AN EFFORT TO NOT LOSE MONEY WILL DENY THEY'RE VICTIMS ACCESS TO CONDOMS TO MINIMIZE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL BE CONTACT WITH CONDOMS AND ARRESTED FOR SEX WORK. NOT SURPRISINGLY DATA FROM MULTIPLE COUNTRIES LINK THIS CRIMINALIZATION OF CONDOMS WITH A FIVE FOLD INCREASE IN THE RISK OF HIV OR OTHER SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS. ARRESTING SEX WORKERS WHEN THEY'RE REPORTING THEMSELVES AS A VICTIM OF RAPE OR USING CONDOMS OF AS EVIDENCE TO CHARGE SOMEONE WITH SEX WORK IS BAD PUBLIC POLICY AND DOES NOT IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY. IT IS DETRIMENTAL TO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOMES. SB TWO THREE THREE IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR ENTIRE STATE BY PROTECTING SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND EXPLOITED CONSTITUENTS THIS BACK BILL PASSED OUT OF ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY. UNANIMOUSLY WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE SEEING NO DISCUSSION OR DEBATE MR MURATSUCHI. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER. YOU KNOW I I SUPPORT THE GOALS OF OF THIS BILL [inaudible] IT'S A TRYING TO PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE TO REPORT MORE SERIOUS CRIMES. IT'S TRYING TO PROTECT. VULNERABLE WORKERS THIS QUESTION THE SAX INTO THE INDUSTRY. AND IS TRYING TO PROMOTE CONDOM USE. TO ACHIEVE OUR PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS. AND THAT'S WHY I THINK MANY OF US INCLUDING MYSELF. SUPPORTED THE BILL. THAT THE OUR COLLEAGUE FROM GLENDALE AUTHOR LAST YEAR ASSEMBLY BILL. TWENTY TO FORTY THREE WHICH PROHIBITED THE USE OF THIS TYPE OF EVIDENCE TO PROSECUTE THESE SERB. PROSTITUTION RELATED CASES WHEN THEY ARE REPORTING MORE SERIOUS OR VIOLENT FELONIES. MY CONCERN HERE IS THAT THIS IS CREATING A BAD PRECEDENT AND THIS IS BAD PUBLIC POLICY. WHEN WE START BANNING CATEGORIES OF EVIDENCE? AND AND CATEGORIES OF ARRESTS. THIS BILL SEEKS TO BAN THE ARRESTS. YOU KNOW TO PROHIBIT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS OFFICERS FROM ARRESTING ANYONE WHEN THEY'RE REPORTING. MORE SERIOUS CRIMES. WHAT? I HAVE A QUESTION MY MIND AS TO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF PROTECTIONS ARE THERE. TO PREVENT SOMEONE FROM JUST REPORTING. NO OR CLAIMING TO BE A WITNESS FOR MORE SERIOUS CRIME IN ORDER TO AVOID. THE ARREST FOR THE CRIME THAT THEY WERE. PERSONALLY ENGAGED IN AND SECOND. TO BAN. AN ENTIRE CATEGORY OF EVIDENCE. AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR I KNOW THAT THERE ARE [inaudible] PROCEDURES. FOR EVIDENCE TO BE EXCLUDED PRIMARILY ON THE BASIS OF CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS WHETHER THERE IT'S A VIOLATION OF THE FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHT AGAINST SERVICE SEIZURE. UNREASONABLE SEARCHES SEARCHES AND SEIZURES. BUT I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY. PRESIDENT OF IN A BANDING AN ENTIRE CATEGORY OF EVIDENCE AND SO. I SUPPORT THE GOAL OF THIS BILL. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. THAT IS CREATING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FORMER PROSECUTION [inaudible] PROSECUTORS. AND FOR THAT REASON I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL [inaudible] DOCTOR QUIRK. PROUD CO AUTHOR OF SP TWO THREE THREE I RISE IN SUPPORT. UP. WE DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS ON RULES OF EVIDENCE -- AND A LOT OF THAT IS DONE FOR REASONS OF PROTECTING THE GET PEOPLE AGAINST SELF INCRIMINATION. OUR THIS BY LOOKING AT CONDOMS CAUGHT. WE ARE JUST SAYING IT'S HEALTHIER IF THEY CARRY THEM THAT IF THEY DON'T. AND THAT SHOULD AND RIGHT NOW. I SPOKE WITH THE GROUP YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN THEM AT THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION -- IT WAS A GROUP OF PEOPLE SAYING A SEX WORKER ST SEX WORK IS REAL WORK. AND IT IS A REAL PROBLEM THAT THOSE FOLKS. AS THEY TELL ME ARE SCARED TO CARRY CONDOMS SO WE SHOULD DEFINITELY GO AHEAD WITH THE BELL. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT IT IS ALREADY A CRIME TO REPORT SOMETHING THAT'S AS A CRIME THAT ISN'T. AND I THEREFORE DO NOT THINK WE WILL GET PEOPLE REPORTING CRIMES THAT ARE NONEXISTENT. THANK YOU. THANK GOD QUIRK. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THE ADAM. MS KAMLAGER-DOVE YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FROM BOTH THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH FOR THEIR COMMENTS ON THIS BILL -- AS WE HAVE GONE THROUGH OVER A DECADE OF HAVING CONVERSATIONS PUBLIC POLICY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SAFE SEX WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO NOW SUGGEST THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE CARRYING PROTECTION WITH YOU WHEN YOU ARE ENGAGED IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY -- HAVING CONDOMS ON YOUR PERSON SHOULD NOT BE PERCEIVED AS A CRIME AND GENERALLY SPEAKING -- PROSECUTORS HAVE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO THEY'RE CHARGING OTHER THAN JUST A COUPLE OF CONDOMS IN SOMEONE'S POCKET I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THIS BILL IS BEING SUPPORTED. BY THE DA'S FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALAMEDA AND SAN FRANCISCO AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS GOOD POLICY THIS IS ABOUT TRADING A MISDEMEANOR FOR A FELONY.
