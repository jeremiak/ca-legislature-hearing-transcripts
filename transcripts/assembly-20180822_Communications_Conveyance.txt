WITHOUT NET NEUTRALITY PROTECTIONS THERE IS NOTHING STOP AN INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER FROM SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT THE WALLSTREET JOURNAL OR THE NEW YORK TIMES OR THE LA TIMES.

WITHOUT GETTING ZERO RATED OUT OF EXISTENCE. TEN YOU ARE CALIFORNIA'S ROLE AS THE INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL OF INNOVATION. LOT THIS BILL -- TRACKS THE PROTECTIONS OF THE TWENTY FIFTEEN OBAMA ORDER I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INFORMATION PUT OUT -- TO THE CONTRARY AND I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE -- WE WORKED EXTREMELY HARD -- IT KNOWING THAT BUT WITH THE TRANSITION OF ADMINISTRATIONS OUT WE SAW THE SLOW MOVING TRAIN WRECK OVER THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR -- THAT THE FCC OF WAS PLANNING -- TO ELIMINATE. ALL FEDERAL NET NEUTRALITY PROTECTIONS -- AND SO WE WORKED VERY METHODICALLY WITH FORMER FCCFCC OUR PERSONNEL WITH ACADEMICS WITH MEMBERS OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WITH ADVOCATES OUGHT TO TAKE WHAT WAS A VERY LENGTHY THREE HUNDRED PAGE. FEDERAL ORDER AND REALLY CONSTRUCTED AS A STATE BILL OF COURSE ANY CUT STATE LAW IS NOT GOING THAT LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME AS AN FCC. ORDER FCC IS A UTILITY STYLE REGULATOR THAT'S NOT HOW WE'RE DOING HERE. OF BUT WE WORKED HARD TO TRACK THOSE OPERA TOXINS. OUGHT THIS AYE AYE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA. TO TAKE A STAND HERE FOR OUR RESIDENTS OFF FOR OUR BUSINESSES WE HAVE GARNERED STRONG AND BROAD -- SUPPORT OFFER THIS INCLUDING -- PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FCC CHAIRMAN TOM WHEELER WHO WROTE THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER HE'S REPEATEDLY. EMPHATICALLY ENDORSED THE SPELL. I IN ADDITION -- OUR HEALTH DEMOCRATIC LEADER NANCY PELOSI SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER -- KAMEL HARRIS OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVEA BRACERO WHO HAS WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH US ON CRAFT IN THE BILL. ON A BROAD LABOR COALITION LED BY THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND A SIGNIFICANT LIST OF ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. THAT'S JOHN COLOR CHANGED ACLU. OF THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY THE CAN CALIFORNIA CONSUMER FEDERATION. AND ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AND THEN A FEW WEEKS AGO WE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A BROAD COALITION OF MIDSIZE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES NOT. THE BIG ONES WHO CAN AFFORD TO PAY WHATEVER IS DEMANDED OF THEM. THAT MIDSIZE COMPANIES WHO ARE TELLING US THAT WITHOUT NET NEUTRALITY PROTECTIONS THEY WILL BE ON THEIR MIND AND INNOVATION AND COMPETITION WILL BE ON THE MINDS. OF SO COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK OF FOR YOUR AYE VOTE I'M WITH ME TODAY ARE A THREE WITNESSES ON PROFESSOR SCOTT JORDAN -- FROM UC IRVINE WHO IS THE FORMER CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER AT THE FCC 420-142-2016 WHICH IS ONE OF TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER OF COURSE WAS PUBLISHED -- PROFESSOR BARBER BANSHEE BACK OFTEN STANFORD LAW SCHOOL WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF STANFORD CENTER FOR INTERNET AND SOCIETY YOU'VE HEARD FROM HER. OUT BEFORE AND THEN MITCH STEIGER FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION [inaudible] OFFICER GEORGE. NOW MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SO MANY SCOTT JORDAN I SERVED TO US THAT HE CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST FROM. TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN AS THE FCC'S MOST SENIOR TECHNOLOGIST. I HELPED FORMULATE AND WRITE THE OPEN INTERNET ORDER THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AS WELL AS THE FCC'S REVIEW OF ZERO RATING THAT WE DID THE PREVIOUS THE NEXT YEAR. AND AS WELL AS THE FCC'S VARIOUS ENDEAVORS OF OVERSIGHT OVER IN A CONNECTION. AND SO I WANT TO TALK TODAY TO YOU BRIEFLY ABOUT THE PARALLEL BETWEEN SBA TWENTY TO MIRRORING THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER SO THE FCC ORDER AS IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED SAID NO BLOCKING YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO WHEREVER YOU WANT ON THE INTERNET. NO APPLICATION SPECIFIC THROTTLING YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THE UPS OF YOUR CHOICE. NO THIRD PARTY P. PRIVATIZATION YOU SHOULD DETERMINE YOUR OWN PRIORITY. TRANSPARENCY YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE BUYING THE PERFORMANCE OF WHAT YOU'RE GETTING. AND YOU KNOW ONE REASONABLE INTERFERENCE OR DISADVANTAGE AND I'M GONNA FOCUS PARTICULARLY ON THAT LATTER. ONE YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF CLAIMS ABOUT ZERO RATING. SO I WANT TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT. THE FCC SAID IN THE ORDER. THAT WE WILL EXAMINE ZERO RATING POLICIES UNDER THIS NO UNREASONABLE DISADVANTAGE STANDARD. AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR WE WENT THROUGH AND CONDUCTED A POLICY ANALYSIS. AND WE LOOKED AT VARIOUS KINDS OF ZERO RATING POLICIES. SO WHAT WE HAD SAID WAS THAT ZERO RATING POLICIES THAT LOOK LIKE FREE NIGHTS OR WEEKENDS AT YOUR MEMBER FROM ALL PHONE PLANTS. THERE IS NO HARM IT TO CONSUMER BENEFIT WOULD BE ALLOWED. SP THE TWENTY TWO DOES EXACTLY THE SAME THING. THE FCC LOOKED AT PLANTS WHERE VIDEO WOULD BE ZERO RATED AND OF ALL THAT HE OWES YOUR RATING NOT JUST PARTICULAR VIDEO. THE FCC THAT'S A CONSUMER BENEFIT AND WOULD NOT BE PROHIBITED SBA TWENTY TWO SAYS THE SAME EXACT THING. BUT THEN THE FCC FLAG TO PARTICULAR CASE. WHERE ARE THE VIDEO OF THE I SP ITSELF IS ZERO RATED BUT OTHER VIDEO IS NOT? AND THE FCC SAID THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT. THE RULE AGAINST. UNREASONABLE DISADVANTAGES ABOUT. AND SAID THAT THAT WOULD VIOLATE THAT RULE SP TWENTY TWO DOES EXACTLY THE SAME THING. ON INTERCONNECTION AGAIN YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THIS. BUT EXPLICITLY SAY THE FCC ORDER DID COVER INTERCONNECTION. WHAT IT SAID WAS THAT WHEN YOU BY INTERNET SERVICE FROM YOUR ISP THEY PROMISE TO GET YOU WHEREVER YOU WANT TO GO ON THE INTERNET AND TO BRING THOSE WEBPAGES CONTENT BACK? TO THE PART OF THAT TRANSPORT THAT'S ON THEIR NETWORK IS WERE THE NO BLOCKING OR THROTTLING RULES APPLY. BUT THE PROMISE GOES BEYOND THAT IT GOES TO WHEREVER YOU WANT TO GO ON THE INTERNET. AND INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS A CRUCIAL PART OF THAT. SO THE FCC SAID. IF INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS ARE BEING USED TO BE VERY AID. THE MAIN RULES LIKE NO BLOCKING OR THROTTLING. THAT THAT WOULD ALSO BE PROHIBITED UNDER THE ORDER. AND THE FCC HAS FOLLOWED UP OVER THE COURSE OF THE REST OF THE NEXT YEAR TO BEFORE THE CHANGE AND THE POWERS THAT BE. IN ORDER TO FOLLOW THAT. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU. TO IN OUR QUESTIONS BE HAPPY TO TAKE. I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP ON THE PARALLELS BETWEEN THESE. TO I JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY NOTING THAT THIS IS THE HIGHEST PROFILE TELECOM INTERNET ISSUE THAT EVER CAME BEFORE THE FCC. THERE WERE MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION COMMENTS FILED BY THE PUBLIC INCLUDING MORE THAN TWO MILLION FROM CALIFORNIA. IT'S UNHEARD OF FOR THAT MANY PEOPLE TO GO OUT OF THEIR WAY OUT FILE COMMENTS WITH THE FEDERAL AGENCY ON AN ISSUE LIKE THAT. AND IT'S BIPARTISAN MORE THAN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTION. I CAN'T IT MISTER CHAIRMAN FORGET THE NEXT WITNESS I DIDN'T LIKE ONE THING -- WE HAVE DISTRIBUTED TO THE COMMITTEE -- A ARE A US VERY SURGICAL AMENDMENT DELETING THE LAST THE SENTENCE OF THE BILL OF WHICH IS THE CONTINGENT ENACTMENTS. A LANGUAGE OF THE AMENDMENT DOES NOT I ANYWAY CHANGE I DON'T BELIEVE I HAVE IN THE* HER EYES AND WOOD SOME COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY NOT. IT WITH DOG YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I SPOKE ABOUT IT BUT LATELY YESTERDAY BUT I DON'T. IT WAS GIVEN THE SERGEANTS TO WHAT. IT WILL GO THROUGH THEM RIGHT NOW. YOU MAY WANT EXPLAINED THAT TO YES [inaudible] I OKAY AWESOME MISTER CHAIRMAN TO MEMBERS THE THE AMENDMENT OF THE LEADS SENT BUT ONLY THE LAST SENTENCE OF THE OF THE ENTIRE BILL NO OTHER CHANGES. ARE AND THAT IS THE LANGUAGE THAT MAKES -- ENACTMENT OF SP TWENTY TWO CONTINGENT ON THE ENACTMENT OF US BEFORE SIXTEEN SO IT WOULD AYE IT BOTH BOTH STILL MOVE FORWARD. ON THE JOINT AUTHORED BOTH SIDES HOPE THEY DO -- BUT IT WOULD ELIMINATE THAT ARE CONSIDERED CONTINGENT ENACTMENTS ABOUT LANGUAGE -- IT'S ABOUT SO AND AGAIN IT DOESN'T IN ANY WAY CHANGE THE SUBSTANCE OF THE BILL SIMPLY BELIEVING THE LAST SENTENCE OF THOUGHTS BEEN OUR HISTORY. MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE BILL AS AMENDED. ARE YOU WOULD NEED A SECOND A PROCEED. ONE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE WITH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. CHAIRMAN SANTIAGO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY. MY NAME A SPOT ROUGH AND SHE VIC I'M A PROFESSOR OF LAW AT STANFORD LAW SCHOOL AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR INTO ITS IN SOCIETY THE I'M HERE TO I HAVE A PHD IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND A LAW DEGREE. I'M HERE TODAY AS AN INDEPENDENT ACADEMIC WHO HAS WORKED ON NET NEUTRALITY FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS. THE F. C. C.'S TWENTY TEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN OPEN INTERNET RULES RELIED HEAVILY ON MY WORK. AS DID THE INDIAN AND CANADIAN RULES ON ZERO RATING AND THE EUROPEAN UNION NET NEUTRALITY GUIDELINES. I'LL LEAVE MY TESTIMONY AT THE OUT AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MITCH STEIGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN NET NEUTRALITY AND WORKERS RIGHTS ORGANIZE WHICH ESSENTIALLY IS JUST A WORKERS RIGHT TO COMMUNICATE OUR ABILITY. TO COME TOGETHER TLK ABOUT WAGES BENEFITS WORKING THAT. SO AS LONG AS THERE'S BEEN A LABOR MOVEMENT HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S VERY CENTRAL TO EVERYTHING THAT WE DO AND THE SAD REALITY IS THAT SOMETHING THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE ALWAYS FOUGHT. ARM WHEN WE MET IN PERSON IT WAS ARMED MILITIAS TO BREAK IT UP WHEN WE STARTED COMMUNICATING BY PHONE -- WE NEED AT THE EXCELSIOR DECISION TO CONFIRM OUR ABILITY TO GET A LIST OF WORKERS AND THEIR PHONE NUMBER SO THAT WE CAN CONTACT THEM. AND FAST FOR TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN DO A LOT OF THIS CAN EDUCATION ONLINE -- THAT DRIVE TO FIGHTER BILLION COMMUNICATE CONTINUES RIGHT NOW THERE'S AN APP CALLED WORK IT THAT A LOT OF WALMART EMPLOYEES USE AND TOM. WALMARTS AS A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY TRYING TO KEEP WORKERS FROM DOWNLOADING IT -- AS WE SPEAK THE NLRB IS MOVING TO ALLOW EMPLOYERS TO PROHIBIT WORKERS FROM COMMUNICATING OVER EMAIL -- DURING OVER WORK EMAIL DURING NON WORK HOURS AND SO THIS IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS ALWAYS AN ISSUE AND YOU KNOW WILL BE AN ISSUE AS LONG AS THERE'S A LABOR MOVEMENT AND OVER ARCHING ALL OF THIS NOW IS NET NEUTRALITY WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO CUTE WAS BECAUSE SO. MUCH OF THIS ORGANIZING HAPPENS ONLINE NOWADAYS AND WITHOUT SENATE BILL. EIGHT TWENTY TWO IT'S PRETTY SCARY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT WORLD COULD LOOK LIKE ARM WITHOUT THOSE PROTECTIONS ARE ESPECIALLY FOR WORKERS IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. WHERE IT WOULD BE EXCEPTIONALLY EASY FOR AN EMPLOYER TO SLOW DOWN OR BLOCK THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE ONLINE ALL TOGETHER? AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENED A WIN TELESAT WORKERS THAT WERE ORGANIZING. THEY DIRECTLY BLOCKED WORKERS ACCESS TO WEBSITE THAT THEY WERE USING AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT WE CAN PROBABLY EXPECT MORE OF IF WE KEEP GOING INTO A WORLD WITHOUT NET NEUTRALITY. AND WHEN YOU PILE THAT ON TO ALL THE OTHER ATTACKS THAT WERE FACING. THE FEDERAL LEVEL FROM THE NLRB FROM THIS THE SUPREME COURT -- STATE REGULATORY BARS ARE IN A FEDERAL REGULATORY BODIES AND A LOT OF OTHER AREAS OR BILLION COMMUNICATE OVER FAIR IN A FREE AND OPEN INTERNET IS REALLY KIND OF OUR ONLY HOPE FOR SURVIVAL AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO US AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE YOU. STILL HAVE ABOUT THREE MINUTES IF YOU WANT TO USE IT WE WERE RECOMMENDING TO JUST SIMPLY DO A LOT OF FOR NEXT TIME. WERE AND I'M NOT RECOMMENDING YOU DO BUT NONE THE LESS YOU HAVE IT WERE HOT WHO WERE RIGHT NOT FAIR TO EVERYBODY MISTER JOE HAPPY TO MOVE THE HEARING.

MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF MY NAME IS BILL DIVIDE THAT REPRESENT A TNT. OUR THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. OUR LET ME JUST STATE FOR THE RECORD THAT EIGHTEEN T. SUPPORTS AN OPEN INTERNET AND ARE AND THE NET NEUTRALITY PRINCIPLES ARE ON OUR WEBSITE AND THERE ENFORCEABLE TODAY BY THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL. AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL AGENCIES WITH JURISDICTION. BUT I AM HERE TODAY TO OPPOSE S. B. A TWENTY TWO SIXTY THREE DAYS AGO THIS COMMITTEE HEARD THAT BILL. AND ADOPTED AMENDMENTS TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN OBAMA ORDER. AS YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS STATED ON PAGE NINE QUOTE THIS BILL SEEKS TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL PROHIBITIONS. THAT WERE NOT PRESCRIBED IN THE FINAL FCC RULES. TODAY AS BE EIGHT TWENTY TWO IS BEFORE YOU AGAIN. YES BE A TWENTY TO RESTORES FLAWED LANGUAGE YOU REJECTED JUST TWO MONTHS AGO. TWO ISSUES I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE FIRST BEING ZERO RATING. A TWENTY TWO WOULD WHAT AND POPULAR DRIVE CONSUMER DRIVEN ZERO READING PROGRAMS -- WE HAVE PRODUCED A STUDY. AND FOUND THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE ENJOYED BY THREE POINT SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS FOR SAVING AS MUCH AS THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH USING ZERO READING PROGRAMS. THE STUDY FOUND THE LOST OF THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS WOULD DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT MINORITIES LOW INCOME CONSUMERS. THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FCC ORDER DID NOT BAN ZERO RATING PROGRAMS. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IN AN INTERVIEW WITH FCC CHAIRMAN TOM WHEELER I QUOTE. WE WERE QUITE SPECIFIC IN THE OPEN INTERNET ORDER SAYING WE WEREN'T GOING TO ADDRESS ZERO RATING BECAUSE WE COULD ARGUE IT BOTH WAYS AND OF QUOTE. AND JUST LAST YEAR BY THE WAY I WAS BROUGHT UP HERE EARLIER THE EUROPEAN UNION. AS WELL AS ONE OF THE LAST HEARINGS JUST LAST YEAR THE U. A EUROPEAN UNION CONCLUDED QUOTE THERE APPEARS TO BE LITTLE REASON TO BELIEVE. THAT ZERO RATING. GIVES YOU A RISE TO COMPETITIVE CONCERNS UNQUOTE. THE SECOND BIG ISSUE IN THIS BILL THAT WE OBJECT TO IS INTERCONNECTION. THE FCC ORDER DID NOT APPLY NET NEUTRALITY RULES TO INTERCONNECTION PAGE TEN PARAGRAPH THIRTY OF THE FCC ORDER QUOTE THIS ORDER DOES NOT APPLY OPEN INTERNET RULES TO INNER CONNECTION UNQUOTE. ON PAGE NINETY TWO PARAGRAPH TWO OH TO WE CONCLUDE IT WOULD BE PREMATURE. TO ADOPT PRESCRIPTIVE RULES TO ADDRESS ANY PROBLEMS THAT EVER RISEN OR MAY ARISE AND OF QUOTE. THE INDUSTRY HAS COMPLIED WITH THE OBAMA RULES THAT WERE ADOPTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND CONTINUED IN PLACE THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN THE INDUSTRY DID NOT CHANGE INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS. DURING THAT TIME. TO SUGGEST THAT THE OBAMA RULES PROHIBITED CHARGING FOR INTERCONNECTION WITH AGE PROVIDERS IS NOT TRUE. S. B. A TWENTY TWO IS A RADICAL DEPARTURE FROM THE HISTORICALLY SUCCESSFUL INTERNET POLICY THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE. SINCE THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION ADOPTED LIKE TOUCH REGULATION IN. NINETEEN NINETY SIX LET ME CONCLUDE BY SUGGESTING THIS WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS ANTI COMPETITIVE. AND AND I CONSUMER AND IS SURELY GOING TO BE CHALLENGED UNDER FEDERAL PREEMPTION. IT WILL DRIVE UP YOUR CONSTITUENTS BILLS FOR INTERNET SERVICE. IT WILL PROHIBIT POPULAR FREE DATA PROGRAMS A CONSUMERS ENJOY OVER THEIR WIRELESS PROGRAMS. AND WE BELIEVE IT'LL INCREASE LITIGATION COSTS. AND THE QUESTION I HOPE THE COMMITTEE WILL ASK FOR WHAT BENEFIT. S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO IS BUILT UPON SPECULATION THAT SOMEBODY. SOMEWHERE SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE MIGHT VOLATILE VIOLATE NET NEUTRALITY PRINCIPLES. TODAY THE NET NEUTRALITY PRINCIPLES ARE ENFORCEABLE BY THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS. WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL CREATE A REGULATORY [inaudible] A COMPLIANCE AND A LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT THAT WILL HARM CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AND ACTUALLY WEAKEN CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP. IN TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS CAROLINE MCINTYRE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION. I TOO WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THE MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION AND ALSO SUPPORT AND OPEN INTERNET AND WE ADHERE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF NET NEUTRALITY. THAT HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE BRIGHT LINE PRINCIPLES. BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT OUT WHILE WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THESE ROLES IT IS IN PART BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE STATE IS STEPPING BEYOND. THEIR LEGAL JURISDICTION AND IMPOSING ANY REQUIREMENTS IN THAT SPACE. WE BELIEVE FIRST OF ALL THAT HAD THE STATE IS PREEMPTED OF THE INTERNET IS IN FACT I'M IN INTERSTATE SERVICE AND IS SUBJECT TO THE RULES OF INTERSTATE COMMERCE. BOTH THE FCC UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE CURRENT FCC HAVE ALSO A PARTICULARLY THAT THEIR INTENT TO PREEMPT THE STATES IN THIS SPACE. AND WHILE SAID WHILE AT CHAIRMAN WIENER IS OFTEN CITED AS THE AB PRINCIPLE SUPPORTER OF THIS LEGISLATION NOTING THAT STATE LEGISLATION IS APPROPRIATE. I'D LIKE TO QUOTE FROM AB THE FROM CHAIRMAN LEGAL AIR AS RECENTLY AS THIS MONTH WHERE HE WROTE. IN A PAPER TITLED TIME TO FIX IT DEVELOPING RULES FOR THE INTERNET CAPITALISM. AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND A NATION IN WHICH THE INTERNET IS OBLIVIOUS TO STATE BOUNDARIES A LACK OF UNIFORMITY BETWEEN STATES CAN IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT. BE AT BURDENS AND UNCERTAINTIES I'M COMPANIES THAT IS OUR CONCERN HERE TODAY ABOUT HAVING STATE BY STATE LEGISLATION. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN THE AYE NOT ONLY SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL BURDENS THAT WILL POTENTIALLY UPSET THE OPERATION OF THE INTERNET. BUT INSIGNIFICANT LEGAL CHALLENGES I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO SOME OF THE CLAIMS OF THE THAT THE PROPONENTS HAVE MADE WITH REGARDS TO INTERCONNECTION. I'M THERE ARE CLAIMS THAT INTERCONNECTION IS NOT BEING PROHIBIT. BUT THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL WAS SPECIFIC TO PROHIBITING MONETARY OR OTHER CONSIDERATION FOR INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS. THAT IN FACT GOES BEYOND ITS POINTED OUT BY MISTER DEVINE GOES BEYOND THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER. BUT I WOULD ADD TO THAT THAT ICE PIECE OF MADE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INVESTMENTS WITH THE UNDERSTANDING. THAT THE COST CAN BE RECOUPED. S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO WHICH CHECKED ALL OF THOSE COSTS MANY THAT HAVE BEEN PAID FOR DECADES BY INTERCONNECTION PARTNERS. TWO WHY S. P. CUSTOMERS YOUR CONSTITUENTS. THERE'S ALSO BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THE BILL INCLUDING A SAFE HARBOR. IF SENATOR WE ARE TRULY WANT IT TO CREATE A SAFE HARBOR THEN THE BILL WOULD NOT APPLY TO INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN AND YET IN PLACE FOR YEARS. AND DON'T APPLY ON A STATE BY STATE BASIS. BASICALLY WE ARE BEING ASKED TO IMPOSE UP TO WITH ABBOTT TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENT HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT IS GOING TO UPS THAT CONTRACTS THAT GO WELL BEYOND THE BORDERS OF CALIFORNIA. TO THE EXTENT YOU HAVE ANY RESPECT AT ALL FOR WITH THAT PART OF THE PROCESS. SOME CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO SOME PRESCRIPTIVE APPLICATION AS OPPOSED TO INTERRUPTING EXISTING CONTRACT. SO I DID I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THATWE DO SUPPORT AN OPEN ENDED THAT BUT THE PROVISIONS OF SB EIGHT TO TO GO WELL BEYOND THAT AND GO BUT WELL BEYOND. ANYTHING THAT I THINK ANYONE HERE COULD ENVISION IN TERMS OF THE OPERATION THE BUSINESS OPERATION OF THE INTERNET. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THIS BILL. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBER STEVE CARLTON HER CTIA THE WIRELESS THAT I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES LEFT AS A COURTESY TO LET YOU FINISH YOUR COMMENTS I WILL CUT YOU OFF BUT JUST TO BE FAIR ON BOTH SIDES GET. THANK YOU -- I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS MY COMMENTS TO THE PROCESS THAT GOT US HERE TODAY WHICH I THINK IT'S A BIT MYSTIFYING. BUT THE NEGATIVE IMAGE THIS WILL CREATE FOR CALIFORNIA'S REPUTATION AS A LEADER IN TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION. AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACT IT'LL HAVE ON MUCH NEEDED INVESTMENT NEXT GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES LIKE FIVE G.. THIS BILL THESE BILLS WILL BE HEARING TODAY GO WELL BEYOND THE FCC'S TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER. IT WAS IT WAS SAID THAT THIS IS THIS BILL TRACKS TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER. IT DIDN'T JUST TRACK IT SPEEDS RIGHT PAST IT. PROPONENTS OFFER JUSTIFICATIONS AS TO WHY IT GOES BEYOND THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER NUMBER VARIAS THEN REVERT TO SAYING THAT WEALTHIEST OF THE A BOMB RULES. TO ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES INCLUDING THIS ONE OFFERED AMENDMENTS TO A TWENTY TWO FAITHFUL TO THE OBAMA RULES. THEY WERE REJECTED. AMBER TOLD BUT CAN'T BE THAT SIMPLE. AND THEN AGAIN WE'RE REVERTING TO SAY WHAT THE TO THE OBAMA RULES. AT THE SAME OR DIFFERENT CLEARLY TO STEP. FOR I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY OF YOUR BILLS. WOULD BE SIX STILL ALIVE IN THE SENATE IF YOU REJECTED AMENDMENTS FOR TWO SENATE COMMITTEES. THE BUDGET FOLKS HERE DIDN'T GET WHAT THEY WANTED IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER AND ARE TRYING TO GET IT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TO REGULATORY MODEL THAT INDEED GOES WELL BEYOND SUPPORTED BY. A NUMBER OF NEWS OUTLETS AFTER THE LAST COMMITTEE HEARING INCLUDING THE CHICO PRESS ENTERPRISE WHICH SAID I QUOTE. WINNERS ESPY AB TWENTY TWO GOES EVEN FURTHER THAN THE NOW REPEALED FEDERAL RULES. THE OTHER SUFFERED SIMILAR AFFIRMATION EIGHT TWENTY TWO IS NOT THE TWENTY FIFTEEN OBAMA RULES. BUT WHAT IS A SAYING BACK CALIFORNIA THE CRUCIBLE OF INTERNET AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS INNOVATION INVESTMENT WHOSE GROWTH AND BENEFITS HAVE BEEN PRECISELY BECAUSE OF A LIGHT TOUCH REGULATORY FEDERAL REGULATORY MODEL. WE HAVE BEEN IT CAN NEED TO CONTINUE TO BE THE LEADER ENCOURAGING ENCOURAGING INNOVATION CREATIVITY AND INVESTMENT. NOT THE STATE THAT BRAG THAT HAS THE MOST PRESCRIPTIVE INTERNET REGULATION AND DAMAGING INTERNET REGULATION IN THE COUNTRY IF NOT THE WORLD IS THAT WE WANT TO BE KNOWN. FOR I DON'T THINK SO. PLEASE I DO NOT ONE LET ME KNOW WE HAD TEMAS BERMAN LET YOU CONTINUE THANK YOU. PLEASE TELL A FEAR OF ON REALIZE TARGETED BASIS FOR LAWS THAT WILL CURB NOT STIFLED THE NECK SITE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF DIGITAL INNOVATION. PLEASE DO NOT LET ALARMIST SPECULATION LA RHETORIC TO TRIUMPH OVER REALITY ARGENEAU VOTE ON AS BEGIN. TWENTY TWO IF THE COMMITTEE WOULD INDULGE ME I'D LIKE THAT LET THE LAST WITNESS AT LEAST HAVE A MONITOR SOME. BUSES ANY OBJECTIONS I AS CHAIR I APPRECIATE THAT I'LL BE VERY BRIEF -- I'M JOHN DORY ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA I'M HERE AND UP AT THE DS JUST TO MAKE SURE.

AGAIN. BUT I JUST WANTED TO FOCUS ON THE ASPECTS OF THE BILL WOULD HAVE CHANGED SINCE THEN AND I I SPECIFICALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT. THE PRACTICE OF ZERO RATING BECAUSE TO ME. THE DEBATE WE HAD BEFORE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BUSINESS PRACTICES OF INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS WE CAN COUNT HAVE A PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT BUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ZERO RATING WORK PROHIBITING A PRACTICE THAT. THE RESULT OF WHICH IS GOING TO BE TO TAKE MONEY OUT OF CONSUMERS' POCKETS. SO IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE SAYING TO INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER. YOU'RE CURRENTLY PROVIDING A SERVICE FOR FREE YOU CAN'T TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE FOR FOR YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. BUT THAT IS VERY CONCERNING TO ME SO I WONDERED IF WE COULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE DRILL DOWN ON WHY EXACTLY ZERO RATINGS SO PERNICIOUS. AND WHY YOU FELT IT NECESSARY TO PUT THAT INTO THE BILL A SURE I WILL ARE COMMON IN MIND THAT WE'RE GONNA ASK QUESTIONS THROUGH THE CHAIR HAS CUSTOMARY MAY CONTINUE. KAREN THANK YOU ARE ALL COMMENT ON THAT AND THEN I'LL ASK -- EYEWITNESSES TO ADD ON I ZERO RATING WHICH IS CALLED FREE DATA PLANS IT'S FREE DATA THAT'S NOT REALLY FREE -- AS INITIAL POLICY MATTER UP WHAT ZERO RATING DOES. IS IT REDUCES COMPETITION. WHICH DRIVES UP COSTS OVERTIME SO IF DOT COM AU I DON'T A PECAN INDIVIDUAL BUSES RAN WITH A VERIZON THEY'RE NOT GOING TO THINK THAT THAT'S A VERIZON -- SAYS -- BUT CIVIL RIGHTS AND SAYS IF YOU USE. UP MY VIDEO PRODUCT IT DOESN'T COUNTING ANSWER DATA IF YOU USE AND THESE COMPETITORS PRODUCTS ACCOUNTS AGAINST HER DATA. HOT DOT IS HIGHLY ANTI COMPETITIVE WORK HEY NETFLIX IS PAYING US A BUNCH OF MONEY SOBRE ZERO RATING THEIR PRODUCT NO DATE IF USE NETFLIX. IF YOU USE THE START UP OVER HERE THAT'S OFFERING COMPETITORS STREAM PRODUCT COULD ACCOUNT AGAINST YOUR DATA. AND STREAMING OF COURSE IS VERY DATA INTENSIVE AND SO WHAT IT DOES OVER TIME IT REDUCES COMPETITION IT SQUEEZES THE SMALLER AND MID SIZE COMPANIES. ADULTS I AND IT PICKS WINNERS AND LOSERS AMONG COMPETITION IS REDUCED THAT OVER TIME RAISES PRICES FOR CONSUMERS WE ALSO KNOW BASED ON EXPERIENCES IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE RESTRICTED THIS KIND OF ABUSIVE ZERO RATING. ANTICOMPETITIVE ZERO RATING ODD THAT WHEN ZERO RATING IS RESTRICTED [inaudible] THEN COST OF AN UNLIMITED DATA PLAN COLLAPSES GO DOWN DRAMATICALLY SO THAT'S A SAVINGS FOR CONSUMER. AND DATA CAPS GO UP SO CONSUMERS GET MORE DATA FOR THE SAME PRICE AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS ZERO RATING SO CALLED PRE DATA PLANS WHERE THEY MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OFF THOSE PLANS FRANK ABOUT IS GIVING AWAY FREE DATA SORT OF A MISNOMER. THEY'RE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY OFF OF THOSE QUORUM CORPORATE DATA PLANS. I PRUDENT PLANS HAVE VALUE ZERO RATING HAS VALUE ONLY IF DATA CAPS ARE KEPT LOW. IF YOU MAKE IT EASY FOR WORKING CLASS AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE TO BUY UNLIMITED OR HIGH DATA CUT PLANS IF YOU MAKE IT AN EXPENSIVE. ZERO RATING HAS NO VALUE BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALL THE DATA YOU NEED TO GO WHERE EVER YOU GO. CAN ONLY HAS VALUE WHEN THEY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR MIDDLE INCOME LOW INCOME PEOPLE TO BUY UNLIMITED DATA PLANS. AND WHERE THEY HAVE LOW DATA CUTS SO ZERO RATING IS INTENSELY ANTI CONSUMER. IT REDUCES CONSUMER CHOICE A REDUCES COMPETITION WHICH RAISES PRICES I WANNA COMPANY IF A NETFLIX IS PAYING A TON OF MONEY TO BE ZERO RATED. WHERE IS WHERE THEY PASSING THAT THROUGH? THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE GONNA END UP PAYING MORE BUT IN THE END WHAT THIS BILL IS A BALLOT AND WHAT ZERO RATING IN PARTICULAR IS ABOUT IS AVOIDING -- THAT WITH AND WITH ALL RESPECT TO THE CABLE ASSOCIATION ACCESS TO THE CABLE CUSTOMER AT THEIR CAPITALIZATION OF THE INTERNET. I THINK PEOPLE ARE VERY USED TO GOING ONTO THE INTERNET I'M GOING WHERE EVER THEY WANT TO GO NOT BEING LIMITED WE ARE HEADED TOWARDS A REGIME IN ZERO RATING IS AT THE HEART OF THIS. WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PUSH IN THE PLANS WHERE OKAY THIS IS YOUR PLAN HERE THE FIVE NEW SO NEW SITES THAT ARE PART OF YOUR PLAN? HERE THE THREE SHOPPING SITES IN ONE SEARCH ENGINE. AYE IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE -- AND JONES SAWYER MENTIONED THIS TO ME IV ISSUE OF WHEN -- YOU COULDN'T WATCH CAN'T WATCH DODGERS GAMES OFF CABLE AYE IN LOS ANGELES. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED TOWARDS WITH A COMBINATION OF LACK OF THE BLOCKING RULES. I AND ZERO RATING OUGHT THAT WE CAN'T DECIDE WHAT WE WANT TO SEE WHERE WE WANNA GO WE'RE BEING TOLD AND MANIPULATED AND ZERO RATING IS AT THE HEART OF THAT. LET ME JUST JUMP IN AND IF THE VICE CHAIR AND WEAK NEEDS ANY FURTHER OF OUR QUESTIONS. IT'S PROBABLY. BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION BUT YOU KNOW I I HAVE. TO OBJECT TO THE CHARACTERIZATION OF ZERO RATINGS ANTI COMPETITIVE. A I MEAN IF YOU. IF YOU USE THAT GENERALIZATION THEM LOTS AND LOTS OF THINGS ARE AT A COMPETITIVE I MEAN IF YOU. IF YOU BUY A TICKET TO GOLDEN ONE CENTER AND YOU GO WATCH A BASKETBALL GAME AND YOU SEE AN ADVERTISEMENT ON THE SIDE OF THE ARENA. YOU KNOW BASICALLY YOU'RE SAYING WELL THAT'S ANTI COMPETITIVE THE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT BECAUSE THAT DISADVANTAGES THE PEOPLE THAT ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR THE ADVERTISING MEN I THINK IT'S UNDERSTOOD. AS A CONSUMER THAT THE VALUE OF THAT ADVERTISING. IS SUBSIDIZING THE TICKET PRICE THAT YOU'RE PAYING. THAT'S THE BUSINESS MODEL THAT THE ARENA AND THE TEAM ARE ARE DAUNTING. AND I DON'T THINK IT'S THE PURVIEW OF GOVERNMENT TO GET IN THE WAY OF THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE GONNA TELL A NETFLIX CUSTOMER. THAT THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO WATCH NETFLIX. WITHOUT EFFECTING THEIR DID THE USING THE DATA UNDERNEATH OR DATA CAP. YEAH I MEAN IF IF YOU WANT TO START A A MOBILE PHONE COMPANY AND OFFER HIGHER DATA PLANS OF YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER. NOTHING TO BE GREAT BUT I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT THESE COMPANIES ALL COMPETE IN A COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE. AND I AM THE THE AYE AYE WE ARE INFERIORS AGREEMENT THAT. WHAT THE MARKET REALLY NEEDS IS MORE COMPETITION BECAUSE MORE COMPETITION CLARIFIES A LOT OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS AND IN PARTICULAR FAIR PRICING? WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY HARD TO WRAP OUR ARMS AROUND. I'M THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT I HAVE WITH THE BAN ON ZERO RATINGS THIS. AND IT GOES BACK TO THE STUDY THAT THAT I EIGHTEEN TI WAS REFERENCING IT ENOUGH A IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE STUDY ANYONE THAT HASN'T HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO ITS ITS EYE OPENING. UP AND BASICALLY WHAT IT SAYS IS THAT FOR THE AVERAGE CUSTOMER. YOU WILL COST THEM THIRTY TO FIFTY DOLLARS A YEAR. BY TAKING AWAY ZERO RATING BUT AT THERE AND THAT'S SUBSTANTIAL BUT WHAT'S REALLY EYE OPENING IS THE FACT THAT A THIRD OF LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS. USE ONLY THEIR MOBILE PHONES. TO ACCESS THE INTERNET. AND FOR THOSE PEOPLE YOU WILL COST THEM HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR THAT'S HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD. AND THIS GETS INTO SOMETHING THAT I'M GET REALLY EMOTIONAL THAT WHICH IS THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE. IN THIS BUILDING. THAT RAISE THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. THE I MEAN I THINK WE'RE ALL AWARE WE HAVE THE WORST POVERTY OF ANY STATE THE COUNTRY HERE. AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE DO. IS THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE IN THIS BUILDING THAT RAISE THE COST OF LIVING THE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU SAYS. THE COST OF LIVING CALIFORNIANS WAS IS WHAT'S DRIVING THAT POVERTY RATE AND SO I I WANT US TO THINK REALLY CAREFULLY. ABOUT TAKING AN ACTION THAT'S GOING TO COST LOW INCOME A CONSUMERS HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR THAT'S THAT'S MY BIG PROBLEM. WITH THE BILL AND THAT'S WHY I RESPECTFULLY ALL HAVE TO BE UP IN OPPOSITION BUT I THINK YOU VOTE FOR THE FOR MISTER TECH AND MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I IF I MAY UM TO THE VICE CHAIRMAN. ADDITIONAL. RESOURCES REQUIRED THIS BILL DOES NOT BAN ZERO RATING. IT BANS CERTAIN FORMS OF ZERO RATING THERE OTHER FORMS THAT ARE NOT BANNED. A AND I WILL SAY THE GROUPS THAT ADVOCATE ARGUMENTS IN POVERTY LOW INCOME BILL THE GROUPS THAT ADVOCATE FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE LIKE THE WESTERN CENTER -- ON LAW AND POVERTY AND OTHER ARE NOT ONLY SUPPORTING THIS BILL PUTS SEPARATELY. AND EMPHATICALLY SUPPORTING THE RESTRICTIONS ON ABUSIVE ZERO RATE IN THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WOULD NOT BE EMPHATICALLY SUPPORTING THE ZERO SPECIFICALLY THAT ZERO RATING PORTIONS OF THIS BILL. IF THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD HURT POOR PEOPLE IT'S POOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING HURT WITH THE ZERO RATING PLANS ON HEALTH WOULD I ASK YOU ABOUT PRESIDENT YOU COULD RESPOND THAT STUDY IN PARTICULAR. BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME MAJOR ISSUES WITHOUT STUDY AND SO FORTH. I'M STUDY WITH PUT OUT THERE WE DON'T AGREE WITH THAT AND WE THINK IT'S NOT VALID. I'M GONNA GO ON TO THE NEXT QUESTION OF MISTER BONTA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER FOR BRINGING THIS THIS BILL FORWARD. HEARD A NUMBER OF ARGUMENTS IN THE OPPOSITION THAT I AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO JOIN ISSUE ON SOME THE KEY ARGUMENTS BEING MADE AND AND SORT OF HAVE BOTH SIDES ADDRESS THEM SO WE CAN. HERE THAT SORT OF A REBUTTAL OUR RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS. SO ONE WAY. TO OFFER THE CHAIR. WERE INTERCONNECTION FEES AND ZERO RATING IN. THAT'S THE SEA TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER [inaudible] IS. THIS BILL PREEMPTED. AND THE LEGAL. YEAH I AM. PLEASE COMMENT ON THE ISSUE OF THE PATCHWORK OF OF HIS. STATE REGULATORY REGIMES. IT'S BEEN RAISED [inaudible] I'M ANY. RESPONSE TO THIS BILL HURTING INNOVATION A TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT. AND THEN THAT THIS IS GONNA LITA. I HAVE A LOT OF LITIGATION. SURE ARM IN TERMS OF INTERCONNECTION I KNOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO DIFFERENT OFFICES WHICH WE SHOWED YOU A LANGUAGE I FEEL THIS IS ONE OF THE ODDEST ARGUMENTS I'VE EVER HAD. BECAUSE IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER THERE IS EXACT LANGUAGE SAYING YOU CANNOT USE. THE POINT OF INTERCONNECTION TO EVADE THE PROTECTIONS IN THIS ORDER WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY TAKEN THAT EXACT LANGUAGE. AND PUT IT INTO OUR BILL IT'S IN THEIR IT'S IN WRITING. AT AND I SO WITH THESE REPEATED ARGUMENTS THAT IT WASN'T IN THERE ARE JUST ARCHES FALSE IT WAS ABSOLUTELY THERE. ON IN TERMS OF ZERO RATING THE FCC BEFORE THE CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION SHUT ENFORCEMENT DOWN THE FCC WAS. COMMENCING ENFORCEMENT UNDER THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER AGAINST ISPS BASED ON ABUSIVE ZERO RATING PLANS. SAYING THAT SOME WERE OKAY. BUT OTHERS VIOLATED THE NET NEUTRALITY ORDER SO THAT THE FCC ITSELF BEFORE THE CHANGE OF ADMINISTRATION. WAS MOVING FORWARD WITH ZERO ENFORCEMENT UNDER THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER. IN TERMS OF PREEMPTION COULD WE EAT. THEY ARE GOING TO SUE AND HAVE EVERY RIGHT IN THE WORLD TO TEST ANYTHING THAT THIS LEGISLATURE PASSES AND QUIRK AND PEOPLE TEST ARE BILLS IN COURT ALL THE TIME AND SOMETIMES. STATE PREVAILS SOMETIMES WE DON'T WE THINK WE HAVE A STRONG ARGUMENT THAT THIS IS NOT PREEMPTED CONGRESS HAS NOT. NOT PREEMPTED THE STATE'S ABILITY TO ACT IN THIS AREA AND THE FCC WE THINK WHEN THE FCC ASSIGNED WE'RE ENDING OUR ROLE. IN REGULATING THAT YOUR TRIAL ATTY. AYE WERE ISSUING A PRE AT ADMINISTRATIVE PREEMPTION ON THE FIFTY STATES OUT WE DON'T HAVE THE POWER OUGHT TO DO THAT I'M DEL CSU AND A COURT WILL ULTIMATELY SIDE WE THINK IT'S VERY DEFENSIBLE. I IN TERMS OF THE PATCHWORK AYE HUNT THIS IS ONE AREA WHERE WE A TO HAVING ONE UNIFORM GOOD NET NEUTRALITY STANDARD IN THE U. S.. ARE AND HAD THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS NOT GONE TO THE FCC. AND TO THE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND SAID PLEASE GET RID OF THE TWENTY FIFTEEN OBAMA ORDER. I WOULD I WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY I WOULD NOT HAVE INTRODUCED THIS BILL. I DID YOU KNOW THAT BE I INSTEAD OF JUST. KEEPING TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER INDUCED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REPEAL IT AND THAT CREATED STATE ACTION AND SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE YOU KNOW. THAT I I JUST DON'T BUY THAT ARGUMENT. AND THEN TERMS OF INNOVATION FINALLY. BUT LET'S BE REAL CLEAR. FOR SEVERAL YEARS. I AND FOR YEARS BEFORE THAT -- THESE. HUGE CORPORATIONS WERE ACTING UNDER NET NEUTRALITY RULES AND MAKING [inaudible] MASSIVE PROFITS THE TNT IS PURCHASING TIME WARNER IF MY NUMBERS ARE RIGHT FOR EIGHTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IS WHAT THEY'RE PAYING. TO BUY TIME WARNER. COMCAST OFFERED I BELIEVE SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO BUY FOX WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK I THINK THEY'RE BUYING A SKYPE FOR THIRTY FOUR BILLION A HOBO NUMBERS ARE APPROXIMATELY CORRECT. THIS IS NOT AN IMPOVERISHED INDUSTRY THIS IS INDUSTRY THAT IS MAKING. A NOR AND AND THAT'S FINAL I'LL HAVE THE DECORUM OF THE HOUSE SO IF WE CAN KEEP OUR VOICES DOWN BUT I WOULD APPRECIATE A AYE AYE GOOD FOR SEEMS WE HAD THESE RESTRICTIONS BAIT DID NOT. I IMPEDE THE ABILITY OF THIS INDUSTRY TO INVEST WHEN THEY WERE IN PLACE BEFORE. AND THIS INDUSTRY IS GOING TO BE JUST FINE AFTER THESE RESTRICTIONS I HOPE. GOING TO AFFECT. MISTER POTTER I'M SORRY OF MISTER BONTA DID YOU HAVE A IS NO NO I MEAN LET'S NOT THAT THE TWO SHIPS PASSING IF IT IF IT IF YOU WANT TO JOIN US. ON ANY OF THE OTHER THE ISSUES AND YOU KNOW. I THINK US NOW GO -- TO MISTER PATTERSON TO ONE BE FAIR TO ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO ASK YOUR QUESTION. THE MYSTERY PATTERSON POINT OF VIEW AND I DRESSED UP MISTER BONTA QUESTION YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AT PENN THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION UP MY TESTIMONY. A ZERO RATING I READ A QUOTE DIRECTLY. DIRECTLY FROM CHAIRMAN WHEELER I ALSO SHE IS CALLING ON THE EUROPEAN UNION. BUT APPARENTLY THE NETHERLANDS IN INDIA -- HAVE SOME SORT OF PROHIBITION ON ZERO RATING OR SET SOME SORT OF POLICIES I DON'T THINK THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE FOLLOWING THOSE TWO PARTICULAR COUNTRIES. BUT I QUOTED THE EUROPEAN UNION'S A QUOTE FROM JUST LAST YEAR SAYING THEY SAW ZERO RATING THEY SAW NO COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGES FROM ZERO RATING. OUR I ALSO QUOTED DIRECTLY FROM THE ORDER. WHERE IT SAYS IT DOES NOT APPLY OPEN INTERNET RULES TO INTERCONNECTION? THIS BILL WILL PROHIBIT THE EXCHANGE OF DOLLARS BETWEEN CONTENT PROVIDERS AND I S. P.'S WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MASSIVE NATIONAL CONTRACTS FOR ALL CONTENT ON THE INTERNET AND THAT HAS BEEN OPERATIONAL SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE INTERNET. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A RADICAL CHANGE. BUILT INTO THIS LEGISLATION AND THEN FINALLY -- I'M GONNA AT THE ISSUE OF PREEMPTION. THE OBAMA ORDER INCLUDED EXACTLY THE PREEMPTION LANGUAGE. AND THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION INCLUDED PREEMPTION LANGUAGE AND YOU DO NOT LOSE YOUR AUTHORITY TO ASSERT PREEMPTION BECAUSE YOU PURSUE A LIGHT TOUCH REGULATORY MODEL. INSTEAD OF A HEAVY TOUCH REGULATORY MY SO PREEMPTION IS THERE BOTH DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS. HAVE INCLUDED THAT IN THEIR ORDERS SO THE VERY BIPARTISAN ISSUE. THEY'RE GETTING MISTER PATTERSON HAD AN ADDITIONAL QUESTION -- YEAH UP. I'D THEN I'D I HAVE TO THINK LONG AND HARD ABOUT THIS -- AND MOST THE MEMBERS KNOW THAT I COME FROM A LONG. A HISTORY OF BROADCAST EXPERIENCE. AND WITH LOTS OF EXPERIENCE WITH THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION. AND WHAT IS TROUBLING ME. OF THE MOST HERE. I IS WITH RESPECT. TO FIFTY DIFFERENT STATES. ENGAGING IN A PATCHWORK. I JUST THINK THAT IS INVITING A LONG LONG SERIES. OF LITIGATION A LONG LONG SERIES OF OF HEARTACHE. AND SO MEMBERS I THOUGHT YOU KNOW I I REALLY THINK WE HAVE TO THINK VERY VERY LONG AND HARD ABOUT PASSING THIS BILL THROUGH. I THINK THERE IS CLEARLY A FEDERAL ISSUE A JURISDICTION HERE. I THINK TO THINK OTHERWISE IS TO SUGGEST THAT THE INTERNET. IS NOT THE MOST DATA. WRITTEN LARGE EXAMPLE OF INTERSTATE COMMERCE THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS. SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THIS AND IN MAKING THE DECISIONS THAT WERE. I THINK THIS GUY CREATES MEANT THAT. SERIOUS UNCERTAINTY IN CALIFORNIA. FOR A LONG LONG TIME BUT I THINK. RATHER THAN HELP THE INTERNET IS ACTUALLY GOING TO DO TOUR INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA. HERE'S MY BIGGER CAN BUT BIGGEST CONCERN. APART FROM THE PREEMPTION AND APART FROM SOME OF THESE OTHER FACTORS. WHAT IF WERE NOT CAREFUL WEEK WE ARE GOING? TO CREATIVE OUR STATE. AN ISLAND OF ITS OWN REGULATIONS. THAT IS GOING TO PENALIZE OUR INTERNET USERS AND OUR CONSTITUENTS I AND I'M I'M STRUGGLING WITH. THE NECESSITY. FOR CALIFORNIA'S REACTION TO A MORE FREE AND COMPETITIVE INTERNET THIS LIGHT TOUCH. APPROACH MEMBER LIKE I I I HAVEN'T HAD A LOOK AT THIS REALLY HARD AND LISTEN TO BOTH SIDES. BUT THE FACTS ARE REALLY SELF EVIDENT. UNDER LIGHT TOUCH REGULATION. CALIFORNIA HOME INTERNET PRICES DECREASED BY MORE THAN 50%. FROM 200-082-2050. AND ALTHOUGH MOBILE BROADBAND INCREASES IN CALIFORNIA. THE WIRELESS BILLS ACTUALLY DECREASED. SOMEWHERE NEAR [inaudible] I IN THE IN THE RUSH TO DO THIS. I'M I'M I'M PLEADING WITH US TO SLOW DOWN. I'M PLEADING WITH US NOT TO LOSE SIGHT. OF THE FACT THAT LIGHT TOUCH REGULATION. HAS ALLOWED A FREE MARKET. YOU PRODUCE RAPID INCREASES IN INTERNET SPEEDS. AND SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN INTERNET PRICES. TO ME MEMBERS THIS LOOKS LIKE [inaudible] PROGRESS. I'M CONCERNED THIS BILL TAKES US BACKWARDS AND I'M I'M GONNA HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY VOTE NO. THANK YOU FOR COMMENTS MISTER PATTERSON A WE HAVE MISTER HOLDEN FOLLOWED BY MR MATHIS. THANK YOU SECURE. MOST OF SENATOR I JUST A QUESTION AS RELATES TO THE TESTIMONY FROM THE OPPOSITION AND THAT WAS RAISED ABOUT THE CONTRACTS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION TIME AND HOW THOSE CONTRACTS THERE'S A CERTAIN DEGREE OF EXPOSURE. FOR THOSE ARE RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE ALREADY ESTABLISHED AND HAS THERE BEEN ANY CONSIDERATION. TO AN INLAND IMPLEMENTATION DATE. THAT WOULD -- COINCIDE OR CREATE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE CONTRACTS TO TO LINE UP WITH -- SO THE THE BILL IT IF THEY HAVE A IF THERE THE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT THE THIRD GOES TOWARD THE END OF NEXT YEAR -- THE BILL AT PLEASE GONNA BE CORRECTIVE ARMAND I DON'T BELIEVE OVERRIDES THAT IT WOULD BE FOR THE ENTER ENTRY INTO NEW. OUR OUR CONTRACTS -- NO THIS IS ABOUT THE INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS -- SO THE BUT IT. SO I WOULD SAY FIRST. THE BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS AS SUCH IT JUST BRINGS BACK THE PART OF THE F. C. C.'S REGIME THAT SAID YOU KIND OF VAGUE. NET NEUTRALITY THROUGH INTO CONNECTION PRACTICES AND IT SAYS VERY EXPLICITLY THAT. INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS THAT DO NOT EVADE THE BILL SENATE NEUTRALITY PROTECTIONS. ARE NOT A PROBLEM. SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE FCC SAID IN ITS ORDER THE WAY IT'S SET SPECIFICALLY YOU KNOW WE HAVE. IN PARAGRAPH ONE NINETY THREE WE ARE NOW AVAILABLE TO HEAR DISPUTES REGARDING ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE EXCHANGE OF TRAFFIC WITH A BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS PROVIDER RACE ON THE SECTIONS TO ONE AND TWO TO ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AND THEN AND SECTION TO A SIX THEY SAID. WE WERE REALLY CONCERNED SO THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KIND OF EIGHT ALL RULES THROUGH INTO CONNECTION. I WAS TUITION OF AUTHORITY OVER INTERNET TRAFFIC EXCHANGE PRACTICES ADDRESSES THAT QUESTION BY PROVIDING US WITH THE NECESSARY CASE BY CASE ENFORCEMENT BOATS TO IDENTIFY PRACTICES THAT MIGHT CONSTITUTE SUCH INVASION ADDRESS THEM SO [inaudible] NOW. IF THE ICE PIECE THINK THEY WERE VIA THEIR CONTRACTS WERE VIOLATING THE FCC'S REGIME BEFORE [inaudible] THEN. I DON'T KNOW BUT I WOULD SO RIGHT NOW THE BILL WILL GO INTO EFFECT AND REPLACE THE REGION THAT WAS IN PLACE AND SO THEREFORE THERE WAS NO. SO FAR THE BILL HAS NOT HAD ANY TRANSITION BECAUSE THE RULES JUST WENT OUT OF AFFECT ON JUNE. SEVENTEEN OR SOMETHING SO IT DOESN'T SEEM AS IF IN THE MEANTIME YOU WOULD HAVE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS THAT WOULD NOT VIOLATE. THE TWENTY FIFTH AND I OPPOSE THE AYE AYE BUT YOU DID FAIR TO MISTER HOLDEN DID YOU DID YOU WANT TO CONTINUE [inaudible] BY WHAT. YES IS THE ANSWER THE QUESTION AYE AYE NOT BECAUSE I IT IT IT IS.% TRUE THAT IT WOULD GO INTO EFFECT JANUARY FIRST AND WOULD AFFECT OUR AND CONGRESS PLACE BUT JUST BE VERY CLEAR. THE FCC'S ORDER YOU TWENTY FIFTEEN RULES WERE OFFICIALLY GONE AS OF JUNE I THINK WAS NINE OR TEN THROUGH THEIR BALLOTS WHICH IS ALSO OF COURSE. FIVE MONTHS AFTER WE INTRODUCED THIS BILL THERE'S NO SICK DOES NOT SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE DID SOMETHING THAT WAS A SURPRISE CHANGE IN THE REGULATORY. ENVIRONMENT OTHER WERE BOUND BY THESE RULES AROUND THAT OUR CONNECTION WITH AND WE CAN READ THE LANGUAGE OF WE GET OUT READ IT BEFORE ABOUT HOW -- YOU THE OBAMA ORDER DID SELL YOU CAN'T USE INTERCONNECTION TO OBEY THEM THAT IS CROWDED PROTECTIONS THAT WAS IN EFFECT UNTIL. RECENTLY I AM AND IT EXPIRED WELL AFTER WE INTRODUCED THE BILL WITH THOSE INTERCONNECTION PROTECTION SO THEY CAN ARGUE THAT THEY MADE DECISIONS WERE. BY A CHANGE IN THE REGULATORY -- ENVIRONMENTS [inaudible] USER. I APPRECIATE THAT ITS I TAKE YOUR IT YOU'RE PROBABLY OF MISTER HOLTON COMMITTEE MEMBER TO ASK TO THE BUDGET JUST TO TO SEE IF THAT -- BECAUSE IT CAME UP IN THE SURE THAT IS THAT THE UNDERSTANDING. OF THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN MAC. I WHAT WE RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE FIRST OF ALL I AM CLEARLY WE HAVE A DISAGREEMENT AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER EXPLICITLY DE AND INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS. IT DID NOT. WE HAVE INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS IN PLACE THEY ARE NOT STATE BY STATE AGREEMENTS THEY ARE NATIONAL AGREEMENTS THEY DON'T DISAPPEAR OVERNIGHT. THE FACT THAT THIS BILL WAS INTRODUCED WITH AN INTERCONNECTION PROHIBITION AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE IMMEDIATELY MOVED TO START DISMANTLING OF CONTRACTS. THIS BILL WILL NOT ONLY BE DISRUPTIVE TO THE MARKET WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO ABOUT UNTANGLING THOSE CONTRACTS TO LOOK TO PUT A STRUCTURE IN PLACE WITHIN THREE MONTHS ASSUMING THAT THIS BILL IS PASSED. WITHIN THREE MONTHS IN ORDER TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS PROHIBITION WHICH DID NOT PREVIOUSLY EXIST BY JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY NINETEEN DETERMINE IF IF I MAY LOOK LET ME -- DIRECTED TO MR HOLDEN SINCE HE'S ASKING THE QUESTIONS. SO I'M ENJOYING THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU AT AND BY. A GUY Y. WHICH IS READ DIRECTLY FROM THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER ARE SEARCHING OF AUTHORITY OVER INTERNET TRAFFIC IT'S CHAIN PRACTICES TRAFFIC IT'S CHANGE. THAT INTERCONNECTION R. ASSERTION OF AUTHORITY OVER INTERNET TRAFFIC EXCHANGE PRACTICES INTERCONNECTION ADDRESSES THE QUESTION BY PROVIDING US WITH THE NECESSARY CASE BY CASE ENFORCEMENT HOLES. TO IDENTIFY PRACTICES THAT MAY CONSTITUTE SUCH INVASION OF NET NEUTRALITY AND ADDRESS THEM -- AND SO THE THAT IT IT'S IN HERE. AND OUR CONNECTION WAS IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER WE USE. ESSENTIALLY THE SAME LANGUAGE. TO BE VERY CLEAR ALSO BECAUSE THEY KEEP SAYING THAT S. B. TWENTY TWO BANDS INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS THAT IS ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE IT IS NOT DOWN. INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS WHAT IT SAYS IS YOU CAN'T USE. A POINT AMERICAN ACTION. TO EVADE NET NEUTRALITY. INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. THAT'S HELD NETWORKS. LINK UP BATTLE DATA FLOWS FROM ONE NETWORK INTO COMCAST OR AT AND T. AND THE CONSUMER. SO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BAN THEIR COACH AGREEMENTS NOR DOES IT BUT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS IT WOULD COMPLETELY DEFEAT NET NEUTRALITY. IF THEY IF WE SAID HEY. COMCAST OR A TNT YOU CAN'T BLOCKER THROTTLE ON YOUR NETWORK. BUT YOU CAN DO IT AT THE POINT WHERE DATA FLOWS INTO YOUR NETWORK THE POINT AMERICAN ACTION. THAT WOULD DEFEAT THE PURPOSE THERE WOULD BE NO NET NEUTRALITY I'M THAT'S WHY THE FCC SAID YOU CAN'T USE APPOINT A BETTER CONNECTION TO OBEY NET NEUTRALITY. AND WHAT WE DO HERE THIS IS NOT BANNED INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS ARE AND THEY WERE BOUND BY THESE OBAMA RULES UNTIL -- A LITTLE OVER TWO MONTHS AGO IT WAS JUST AT MID JUNE THAT THOSE RULES EXPIRED. AND ALREADY AT THAT POINT. OUT OF THE SENATE AND WAS YOU KNOW COME INTO TO THIS COMMITTEE SO THERE'S NO SURPRISES HERE THIS DOES NOT UP AND THEIR INTERCONNECTION. AGREEMENTS OUGHT WHAT THIS DOES IS SAID YOU CANNOT SAY IF YOU DON'T PAY ME THIS MONEY IN YOUR TAX AGREEMENT ON THE BLOCK YOUR WEBSITE. I DON'T THINK WE WANT THAT TO HAPPEN AND I DON'T WANT TO DELAY -- HAVING NOT AS A RULE SO THAT THAT'S HOW WE USE HERE MISTER HOLDEN. WOULD WOULD YOU BE KIND OF CLINICAL MYTH WITH MATH. ARE YOU OKAY WITHOUT. CONTINUOUS HOLDEN I APOLOGIZE YEAH I I APPRECIATE THE THE RESPONSE THAT'S VERY HELPFUL -- IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T ALREADY HEARD THE HEALTH WELL MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK THE SENATOR WIENER JUST HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. WHAT THE BILL PROHIBITS? IS A IS IS PAYMENT FOR DELIVERY OF THE CONTENT. STORY KLEE THE INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT THE ESSENCE OF THE AGREEMENT IS THE CONTENT PROVIDER WHETHER IT'S AN AMAZON OR GOOGLE OR SMALL CARRIER OR NETFLIX EXETER. ENTERS INTO A CONTRACT WITH THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THEY PAY FOR VOTE DELIVERY. OF THAT CONTENT TO THE END USER THOSE DOLLARS ARE USED FOR OPERATION MAINTENANCE AND EXPANSIONS OF THE NETWORK THEIR ECONOMIC AGREEMENTS TO ENSURE THE CONTENT PROVIDER IS ABLE TO GET THEIR CONTENT TO THE END USER. EXACTLY AS THEY'VE DESIGNED THAT CONTENT AND THAT THE END USER HAS AN EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE IF YOU NOTICE OVER THE YEARS. DELIVERY OF CONTENT HAS GOTTEN BETTER AND BETTER IT IS BECAUSE OF THESE ENTERED IT INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS. AND THOSE INCLUDE PAYMENT FOR DELIVERY IF YOU REMOVE PAYMENT FOR DELIVERY AS THIS BILL DOES. THEN WE ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT AND DELIVER FOR FREE WHERE DOES THE EXPENSE OCCUR IT GETS MOVED TO THE END USER ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AND THEN FINALLY THE OTHER COMMENT I'VE HAD MY TESTIMONY MULTIPLE TIMES. THE QUOTE FROM THE FROM THE FCC THIS ORDER DOES NOT APPLY OPEN INTERNET RULES TO INNER CONNECTION THE FCC WAS CLEARED TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN MY LAST OBSERVATION. IS THE S. WE OPERATED BEFORE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WITHOUT THE OBAMA RULES WE OPERATED FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS WITH THE OBAMA RULES AND TODAY WE OPERATE UNDER THE CURRENT FCC RULES WE DID NOT CHANGE. ANY INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS REGARDLESS OF WHICH REGIME WE OPERATED UNDER THEREFORE THEY DID NOT PROHIBIT. PAYMENT FOR INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. I DO KNOW IF YOU RAISE YOUR HAND AND I APOLOGIZE. I MISSED RODRIGUEZ. YEAH I WANT TO THANK A SENATOR FOR BRING IN THIS SO. ISSUE TO OUR ATTENTION OBVIOUS IT THAT'S VERY. UNIQUE AND CHALLENGING OTHERS A LOT OF MOVING PARTS VERY COMPLICATED ON HONDA. SHARE WHAT'S REALLY THAT THE ISSUES ARE AND WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING BUT SOMETHING DEAR TO ME AND BECAUSE MY BACKGROUND YEAH MASS IN IN WORKING WITH. FIRST RESPONDERS FOR MANY YEARS. A VERY -- CONCERNED ABOUT THE ARTICLE TODAY IN LA TIMES -- CHAIR IF I CAN JUST READ A FEW SENTENCES FROM THAT [inaudible] THAT'S OKAY -- THE FIRST SINCE IN THE ALLEY CAO LA TIMES TODAY. SANTA CLARA FOR SANTA CLARA COUNTY FIREFIGHTERS WERE CRITICALLY HINDERED BY INADEQUATE INTERNET SERVICE WHILE THEY HELP BATTLE THE MASSIVE MENDOCINO COMPLEX FIRE. IN JULY. THIS THROTTLING HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY SERVICES -- WOODEN QUAN ON AUNT BUT OUT OF THAT IN TRYING TO GET MORE WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IS CONCERNING TO ME -- IT'S KIND YOU -- AN ISSUE THAT IT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT JUST TRYING. SEE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN COMPARE WE'RE DOING HERE BUT QUICK KROGER SUMS IT THERE'S AN ISSUE HERE. IF THE FOR FIRST RESPONDERS. ARE BEING HINDERED BY THE TYPE OF SERVICE AND CONNECTIONS AND SPEEDS. IF IT'S HAPPENING TO THEM. AND THE MOST CRUCIAL NEED OF DOING THEIR JOB OF PROTECTING OUR PEOPLE AND SAVING LIVES AYE I'M HAVING A PROBLEM WITH THAT IT'S JUST MORE OF A COMMENT. CONCERN AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO TO ADDRESS THAT -- BUT I JUST WANTED IT -- TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THIS ARTICLE TODAY THAT. TO ME IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING AS WERE. TALKING ABOUT THIS A IT BILL TODAY IT'S ONE MAKE SURE WE FULFILL YOUR WISH ON THIS RODRIGUEZ WAS IT WAS A DIRECTION -- WAS A QUESTION DIRECTED TOWARDS A MISTER WE KNOW THE AUTHOR OR WAS DIRECTED TO VERIZON I THINK IT'S JUST A COMMENT IN GENERAL. AND OUT OF ANYBODY WANTED TO SPEAK TO IT BUT IT'S JUST BECAUSE THAT WAS TODAY IT CAN WORK YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF UNIQUE I GUESS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SUBSTANCE HONORED. THAT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE AN IMPACT WITH THAT IF YOU LOSE YOU AGAIN ASK THE AUTHOR IF YOU LIKED IT TOO AND OTHER MEMBERS TO COMMENT CONCERNED LET ME. I DO THINK THAT IT IS VERY VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HEAR. FROM THE PROVIDER. TERMS OF BEING USED WITH RESPECT TO THROTTLING IT'S AFTER. IN THE VERY ARTICLE THERE IS AN EXPLANATION OF WHAT HAPPENED AND I THINK WE NEED TO HEAR THAT IN ORDER TO BE FAIR WITH RESPECTED THIS AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE MR MATTERS AND I WAS GONNA BE MY NEXT POINT. SO THANK YOU BUT BUT WHAT I DO ONE ON ENSURES THAT WE DON'T END UP IN A CONVERSATION THAT IS NOT EXACTLY PART INTO THE BILL BEFORE US BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WILL BE A SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING -- DOWN THE LINE IF I'M STICKING DIRECTLY SPECIFIC TO THAT ISSUE YOU WANT TO GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY BONDS IF YOU WISH TO RESPOND. I AND THEN I WANT TO MOVE CONTINUE BACK ON ON THE BILL IF IT'S OKAY WITH EVERYONE NOTHING I'VE YOU YOU MAY IF YOU LIKE I IN THE SURE I ABOUT I WOULD HAVE TO DIE ODD NUMBERS OF THAT WAS VERY DISTURBING I THINK TO TO MANY OF US. ARE AND I I DON'T YOU KNOW I BEFORE I WOULD. NO COMMENT DEFINITIVELY ON WHAT HAPPENED I WOULD OF COURSE WANT TO KNOW. EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED BEYOND WHY I'VE READ IN THE PRESS ABOUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS. REGARDLESS I KNOW VERIZON HAS ITS ITS JOB ITS TAKE ON WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY. I I I I DO THINK THAT IT WAS ANOTHER IT WAS. SORT OF EVIDENCE ONCE AGAIN OF HOW CRITICALLY IMPORTANT INTERNET ACCESS IS TO IT EVERYTHING INCLUDING PUBLIC SAFETY. I AND THAT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO HAVE THROTTLING WHATEVER THE REASON WAS FOR THE THROTTLING -- THAT IT IS IT IT CREATES PROBLEMS AND IN TERMS OF SLOWING DOWN UP BUT AGAIN I AYE BECAUSE ALL I KNOW IS WHAT I READ IN THE PRESS I DON'T WANNA DEFINITIVELY COMMENT ON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS HOW DEEP ARE SILLY ON BEHALF OF VERIZON WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND. TO THE QUESTION. I'M VERIZON IT'S STRONGLY COMMITTED TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND THIS WAS VERY TROUBLING THING TO LEARN YESTERDAY. I AND THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION. HOWEVER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE NET NEUTRALITY. NET NEUTRALITY IS WE HEARD HERE EARLIER TODAY ADDRESSES CONTENT DISCRIMINATION. I AND THERE'S NOT EVEN AN ALLEGATION HERE THAT THIS WAS I AM REDUCING SPEED BASED ON CONTENT. MR IS CONTENT NEUTRAL BASED ON A CUSTOMER. AYE CHOOSING A DATA PLAN THAT HIDE A DATA ALLOTMENT AND WHEN THEY REACH THEIR DATA ALLOTMENT AS AGREED. TO BE SPEED WAS REDUCED. I VERIZON DOES HAVE -- IN INTENDED PRACTICE INTERNALLY WHEREBY AN EMERGENCY SITUATION CAN TRIGGER. I'M THE ESCALATION OF A SITUATION LIKE THIS AND ANY LIMITATIONS ON THAT PARTICULAR DATA PLAN CAN BE REMOVED. IN THIS SITUATION I BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE WAS NOT AWARE OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE AND BATS AND INTENDED PRACTICE. AND SO VERIZON HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS WAS A MISTAKE WE ARE ACTIVELY I'M LOOKING INTO THE SITUATION NOW AND TAKING PROACTIVE STEPS TO ADDRESS THIS MOVING FORWARD [inaudible] I AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO FOLLOWING UP WITH EVERY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE TO INFORM YOU OF WHAT PROACTIVE STEPS WE WILL BE TAKING. HOWEVER THIS IS A VERY SEPARATE ISSUE FROM THE NET NEUTRALITY DEBATE WE'RE HAVING AND THESE PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT THE COMMITTEE IS HEARING TODAY. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I DON'T SEE ANY -- THEREFORE. ON ANY. IT DOES THE AUTHOR WISH TO CLOSE. PAT YES THANK YOU ARE MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK COMMITTEE MEMBERS BOTH. THOSE WHO ARE SUPPORTIVE AND THOSE WHO ARE NOT FOR THE VERY THOUGHTFUL. OUR DISCUSSION TODAY ARE WE ARE YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID BEFORE I REALLY WISH. I THAT I COULD USE THIS BILL FOR SOMETHING ELSE ANA AND I WISH THAT WE HAD A FEDERAL PROTECTION TO PLACE. ARE BY WHAT HAPPENED DIE IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR THAT TOOK EFFECT IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR WAS NOT JUST THE REPEAL OF THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER. IT WAS BASICALLY THE APPEAL REPEAL OF I THINK ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS WORTH OF FCC RULES ARE ON THAT NEUTRALITY BECAUSE TWENTY FIFTEEN WAS NOT THE BEGINNING -- THERE WERE RULES IN PLACE BEFORE IT WAS ALL WHITE TO WHITE. SO RIGHT NOW IT IS EFFECTIVELY IMPOSSIBLE UNDER FEDERAL LAW TO ENFORCE NET NEUTRALITY BECAUSE THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION IS NOT AN EFFECTIVE VENUE IT'S A GREAT AGENCY BUT ON THIS ISSUE IT'S NOT AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO IT. AYE AND SO WITHOUT THE STATE'S STEPPING IN AND WE'RE NOT THE FIRST. THREE STATES HAVE ALREADY PASSED NET NEUTRALITY PROTECTIVE LAWS ARE GOVERNORS HAVE ISSUED EXECUTIVE ORDERS SO IN TERMS OF THE PATCHWORK YOU KNOW WHICH WHICH THE ISPS CREATED BY.

ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU I JUST HAVE THE SAME RULES APPLY. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BILL DIVINE -- STILL WITH A TNT. OF I THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY -- WE DO OPPOSE SP. FOUR SIXTY WE BELIEVE IT'LL INCREASE COSTS TO THE STATE CAPITOL IN CROSS IT'LL INCREASE COSTS TO A CONTRACTORS THE FCC ORDER DID NOT INCLUDE. ANY PROCUREMENT PROVISIONS STATE LOCAL OR FEDERAL -- OBVIOUSLY S. B. FOR SIXTY DOES APPLY NET NEUTRALITY RULES TO PROCUREMENT HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS MANY OF YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW -- ISPS CONTRACTING WITH THE STATE ARE ALREADY [inaudible] REQUIRED. CERTIFY THAT THEY ARE IN FULL COMPLIANCE. ALL STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS BEFORE THEY CAN ENGAGE IN A CONTRACT TO PROVIDE SERVICES WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WE THINK SB FOR SIXTY BY BEING LINKED BACK TO SP A TWENTY TWO ADDS A LEVEL OF CONFUSION. ADDS A LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY. OPENS THE DOOR FOR GREATER PROTEST OVER CONTRACTS AND POSSIBLY PROTESTS DURING THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACT. OUT WE THINK THIS IS THAT'S COST. TO BOTH THE CONTRACTOR AS WELL AS THE STATE AND WE WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE TO REJECT THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CAROLINE MCINTYRE BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION WE ARE ALSO OPPOSED TO THE BILL FOR THE REASONS STATED TAB BY EIGHTEEN T.. I WOULD SIMPLY ADD -- THAT WE DO BELIEVE THE STATE HERE IS PREEMPTED THIS AWHILE ADDS THIS BILL AND THE PROVISIONS OF THE SPELL. ARE CONTINGENT UPON THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THAT WE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED S. B. AND EIGHTY TWO I WILL ALSO ADD THAT THE COURTS HAVE ALSO RULED THAT IT STATE CANNOT USE TO REGULATE HAD DIRECT DIRECTLY INDIRECTLY WHAT THEY ARE PROHIBITED. FROM REGULATING DIRECTLY AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THIS. MISTER CHAIR MEMBER STEVE CARLSON PROCEED TIA WHERE THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY TRADE ASSOCIATION I'M I'D ADD TO THAT THOUGH IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT HOW MANY STATE AGENCIES. THAT -- HAVE YOU KNOW. COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE INTERNET TO THEM THEY DO IT ALL THE TIME PUBLIC SAFETY IS AT THE BIG ONE A SILLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ. AND WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS IS GONNA MAKE THAT WAY MORE COMPLICATED -- IT CHALLENGE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT WE REALLY WANT. IF YOU HAVE. IT'S EIGHT FIFTY DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES ALL. WITH THEIR OWN IDEA OF WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE INTERNET. HOW WAS A CONTRACTOR GONNA KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO SO WE THINK THAT'S GOING TO CREATE ENORMOUS CONFUSION -- IT'S GONNA GO WELL BEYOND EVEN BUT S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO IS GOING TO DO WHICH IS GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT SO WE WOULD. STRONGLY URGE THE CAN TO REJECT THE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST JOHN DORY ABOUT THE CIVIL JUSTICE SO SHE ASIAN. ONE ECHO LITTLE BIT OF WHAT MISTER CARLSON SAID THERE -- BECAUSE FUNDAMENTALLY ON ITS OWN FOR SIXTY DOESN'T HAVE A PRIOR RIGHT PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. BUT BECAUSE EIGHT TWENTY TWO WHICH IS LINKED TO DOES NOT ONLY WILL YOU NOW HAVE EACH AGENCY TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT IS COMPLIANCE -- YOU WILL HAVE INDIVIDUALS BEING ABLE TO SUE AND CLAIM THAT THERE'S NONCOMPLIANCE -- AND DE FOR EVERYBODY'S BEEN LISTENING TO THESE HEARINGS THERE'S DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHAT -- THE LANGUAGE MEANS SO THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE RESOLVED. OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THE COURT SETTING FOR THIS BILL TO ACTUALLY BE EFFECTIVE AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE THINK IT'S A IT'S IT'S CREATING A SYSTEM THAT WILL BE CONFUSING AND EXPENSIVE. AND NOT A BENEFIT TO CONSUMERS. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES OPPOSITE ON OPPOSITION. HELLO MISS ON BEHALF OF CONSOLIDATE COMMUNICATIONS IN OPPOSITION. SARAH BOOT WITH CAL CHAMBER IN OPPOSITION. OUR GLASS YOU HAVE COMCAST. HE WORKS HOW THRILLED YOUR COMMUNICATIONS AND OFFICES. Q. CARMONA WITH* COMMUNICATIONS IN OPPOSITION. BRENDA PALOMINO ON BEHALF OF SPRINT ALSO IN OPPOSITION.

DROUGHT COOK FOR THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES A TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. UPON THE BENTSEN ON BEHALF OF CAL CALM IN OPPOSITION. SUSAN PETERSON LEPER ON BEHALF OF T. MOBILE IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] SOMETIMES OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A SENATOR I TO QUESTION ABOUT THE CONTINGENCY PROVISION OF THE BILL. SO THE CONTINGENCY PROVISION SAYS THAT THE BILL IS CONTINGENT ON THE ENACTMENT OF THE BILL WE JUST HEARD S. B.. TWENTY TWO A A TWENTY TWO SAYS THAT ALL INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE TO ABIDE BY NET NEUTRALITY YOUR BILL SAYS THAT. INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA AFTER BY DIED SO. PRESUMABLY THAT SITUATION WOULD ALREADY BE COVERED BY A TWENTY TWO ARE CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT. CLEARLY IF YOU. THE BILL ITSELF -- POINT TO WHERE YOU'RE A CONFUSE THAT AND I'LL SURELY THROUGH THAT -- SO I SECTION THREE SAYS THIS ACTUAL BE OPERATIVE ONLY OF SENATE BILL EIGHT TWENTY TWO OF THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN REGULAR SESSION IS ENACTED AND BECOMES EFFECTIVE. RIGHT SO EIGHT TWENTY TWO RT SAYS THAT ALL INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE TO ABIDE BY THESE REGULATIONS. YOUR BILL SAYS ONLY THOSE WHO PROVIDE SERVICES TO GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WOULD SO WOULD SEEM LIKE THE PROVISIONS OF YOUR BILL PARTY COVERED BY A TWENTY TWO SO I'M I'M I'M ASKING WHY YOUR BILL IS NECESSARY. AN ADDITIONAL REMEDY IT'S A BACK UP OF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WITH A IF THE NET NEUTRALITY PRINCIPLES ARE ADOPTED AND COULD FIGHT INTO LONG CALIFORNIA. THAT WE DO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL REMEDY THAT MAKES VERY CLEAR EXPLICITLY CLEAR STATUTORILY. THAT WE WON'T ENTER INTO ANY CONTRACTS WITH ANY ISP PROVIDER. OF WITH ANY STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCY -- SO IT'S AN ADDITIONAL BACKSTOPS IF YOU WILL. AND IF I COULD ADD TO AN AUTHOR IS. MISTER WILKEY WOULD DO I BUT I'M STILL CONFUSED SO PLEASE LET ME YEAH SO AND IT IS ONE ADDITIONAL IT IS A REMEDY -- DOT THAT YOU VIOLATE IF YOU BUY INDIVIDUALITY -- THERE'S YOUNG UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW. UP BUT YOU CAN ALSO THIS IS ANOTHER. THE WAY IN WHICH BID TO THE SIDE OF TO VIOLATE THE LAW. I'VE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED EITHER LAWS OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS AROUND THOSE HOLIDAY IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN I BELIEVE THEY'VE ALL INCLUDED. UP BANDS ON PUBLIC CONTRACTS BECAUSE OF THIS IS NOT A NEW THING THEY WERE DOING IT THIS IS WHAT THE STATES HAVE BEEN DOING. A SINCE THE TRUMP FCC GOT RID OF THAT OWNERS HOLIDAY TIME JOB SO I UNDERSTAND. IF THIS WAS AN INCREMENTAL STEP. SO FOR EXAMPLE [inaudible] WE'RE SAYING. THE PUBLIC CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT BUT WE THE STATE WITH TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE GOING TO INSIST THAT OUR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS ABIDE BY THESE REGULATIONS THAT I WOULD UNDERSTAND. BUT WE'RE NOT DOING THAT INSTEAD WERE SAYING EVERYBODY MUST ABIDE AND THEN IN A SEPARATE PIECE OF LEGISLATION. WERE SAYING PEOPLE THEY PROVIDE SERVICE TO THE STATE MUST ABIDE AND THAT THAT'S WHY JUDGES DON'T UNDERSTAND THE NEED OR THE I WOULD BELIEVE THAT IF YOU VIOLATE. SP TWENTY TO THEN YOU'RE RESTRICTED IN YOUR ABILITY TO ENTER INTO A PSYCHOTIC UP OKAY THAT MEANS THEWAY THE WAY I READ IT TWENTY TWO IT SAYS THAT THAT. YOU CANNOT DO BUSINESS IN THE STATE. UNLESS YOU ABIDE BY THOSE REGULATIONS SO I ENJOY THAT BUT I HOPE MUMIA THAT MR BISOGNO MORE TRY OKAY OF THE WILL OF GIVE YOU MORE ONE MORE TRY TO SEE IF A A IF IT'S MUCH MORE. CLEAR AND I APOLOGIZE TO YOU FOR ITS ITS IS NOT IS IS IS A CLEAR PERHAPS IT SHOULD BE. UP THE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER. SEPARATE FROM CONSUMER ITSELF. BUT THIS MEASURE DOES SPECIFICALLY HERE. FOR SIXTY S. FOCUSES EXCLUSIVELY ON OUR STATE AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND THOSE TAXPAYER DOLLARS THAT WE UTILIZE THROUGH STATE BUDGET THAT WE VOTE ON EITHER FOR OR AGAINST. SO IN A VERY EXPLICIT LANGUAGE IT STATES CLEARLY THAT IF IN FACT THE AYE SPEEDS DON'T ADHERE TO NET NEUTRALITY PRINCIPLES LAWS. AS ARTICULATED IN THE VERY ROBUST DEBATE UP PRIOR ON THE SIMPLY -- STATE CENTERS A MEASURE S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO A TWENTY TWO THAT. THE CITY CALIFORNIA WOULD BE PROHIBITED. MAJORING IN TO ANY TYPE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION WITH REGARDS TO ISPS AND THE INTERNET. IF IN FACT THOSE NET NEUTRALITY A PRINCIPLES ARE VIOLATED IN CALIFORNIA IS VERY STRICT PORTRAITURE OUT CENTER I UNDERSTAND WHT THE BILL DOES I JUST DON'T THINK IT DOES ANYTHING THAT EIGHT TWENTY TWO DOESN'T ALREADY DO. THAT IF THEY TWENTY TWO WASN'T THERE I WOULD UNDERSTAND DEBATING THIS IS A HALF MEASURE BUT BECAUSE HE TWENTY TWO WAS THERE AND BECAUSE THIS BILL. IS CONTINGENT ON THE ENACTMENT OF THE TWENTY TWO I JUST DON'T SEE THAT WE'RE WE'RE GETTING ANY FURTHER BY PASSING BUT I THINK YOU'VE HEARD OF FOR US. ANSWERED THE QUESTION. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ANY CLOSING COMMENTS ABOUT THE AUTHOR NO THANK YOU MUCH -- I I THIK THAT WE HAVE REALLY ROBUST DEBATE AND A TWENTY TWO THAT THE MEASURE IS SIMPLE AND STRAIGHT PORT. ARE SLIGHTLY ES WHEN I BOOKED. BEFORE WE CAN GET. TWO AN AYE VOTE WE WOULD NEED A FIRST AND A SECOND. I'LL MAKE THE MOTION. WE NEED A PSYCHIC YOU MISS CALENDAR.
