S.. SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE THE NON EXCITING COMMUNITY COLLEGE ISSUES TODAY. CARE TO A. IN A PAIR OF SORRY IS THE TRUTH. APPEAR TO US TO YESTERDAY. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T SELL A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. YEAH THE WORKFORCE OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION. SEGMENT IN OUR COUNTRY AND. A FEW IMPORTANT ISSUES TO DISCUSS TODAY. CAPITAL OUTLAY. OUR COLLEGE UPROMISE LE FUNDING. PROGRAM FOCUSED ON X. INCREASING ACCESS TO COMMUNICABLE SIX WEEK LOTS LAST YEAR THE SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS AND PLEASE AT THE. GOVERNOR SIGNED THE BILL THE IN THE YEAR. AS WELL AS OF A FEW OTHER. ISSUES WITH DEFERRED MAINTENANCE INNOVATION AWARDS STAFFING AND THE VETERANS RESOURCE CENTER. SO WITH THAT LET'S START WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE. PROP FIFTY ONE CAPITAL OUTLAY. LOW. I'M MANY CATS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THANK YOU OF SOMETHING MEMBER MCCARTY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAPITAL OUTLAY PROPOSAL. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES FIFTY NINE POINT TWO MILLION IN GEO BOND AUTHORITY FOR SIXTEEN CONTINUING AND FIVE NEW PROJECTS. THAT ADDRESS CRITICAL FIRE LIFE SAFETY ISSUE STATEWIDE. ALL BUT ONE PROJECT WILL BE FUNDED FROM THE PROP FIFTY ONE ON SO RECENTLY PASSED. OVER ALL THESE PROJECTS WOULD OBLIGATE APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED MILLION OF THE TWO BILLION AND PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE BONDS PROVIDED FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION HERE ON THE ADMINISTRATION. SO THEY JUST GO INTO THAT THE. DIMINISH CITIZENS RATIONALE FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS. ACROSS ALL DEPARTMENTS STATE WHY NOT JUST COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS THAT FUNDS FOR NEW PROJECTS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO ISSUES. SUCH AS FIRE LIFE SAFETY OR COURT MANDATES. BUT WE WOULD NOTE THAT VIOLATES SAFETY DOES NOT NEED TO BE THE SOLE CRITERION FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROJECTS. TO BE CONSIDERED FOR FUNDING. BUT I SHOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER. IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERS WHETHER REQUESTING DISTRICT AND PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF MATCH WHETHER THERE ARE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT PREVENTED DISTRICT KIDDING. AN EXAMPLE OF THE LATTER WOULD INCLUDE. READ WHAT'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT THAT'S A. SMALL DISTRICT THAT HAS SOME SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS RESULTING FROM A RECENT SEISMIC ANALYSES. I CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY THE ADMINISTRATION LEVEL EXPECTS WILL BE LOCAL MATCHING FUNDS AS PART OF THE FUTURE REQUESTS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION PAYS A THREE CONTINUING PROJECTS. TWO IN SAN FRANCISCO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND ONE IN PASADENA COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. OF THE FIVE YEAR PLAN NOTES THAT THE COMMITTEE CALLED SO CALIFORNIA FIGHTER PLANET NOTES THAT THE COMMUNICABLE EDGES. OF REPORTED OVER TWENTY BILLION AND INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. WITH ONLY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION REMAINING AND PROP FIFTY ONE. OF WE BELIEVE THAT STATE INVESTMENT SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THOSE PROJECTS THAT ADDRESS THE CRITICAL FIRE LIFE SAFETY NEEDS. AND WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU LA JOH. GOOD AFTERNOON A GROUP BROUGHT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE DON'T OF ANY PARTICULAR CONCERNS WITH THE PROJECT EVER CHOSE THEM. BY THE ADMINISTRATION INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. I'M ARE OUR MAIN CONCERN IS THAT THE THE GOVERNOR FUNDS TO FEW PROJECTS I'M CONSIDERING THAT THE SIZE OF THE PROP FIFTY ONE BOND WHICH WAS TWO BILLION DOLLARS. AND THE PROJECTS INCLUDED IN THE IN THE BUDGET. AT UP TO ABOUT SEVEN PERCENT OF THE A COMMITTEE BECAUSE PROP FIFTY ONE I'M FUNDING SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER AUTHORIZING. A MORE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROJECTS AND DEVELOPING A MULTI YEAR PLAN FOR SPENDING THOSE AND WE THINK THAT WOULD. HELP OUR CREE CERTAINLY FOR THE COLLEGES AND ENSURE THAT THE VOTER APPROVED BONDS ARE SPENT. IN A TIMELY MANNER AND WE WE HAVE BEEN REVIEWED THEIR YOUR AGENDA INCLUDES. THE NINE PROJECTS THAT THAT ARE THE CHANCES OF WAS APPROVED THAT WE'RE NOT. INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET WE DON'T WE DON'T REVIEW ALL THOSE TELL YOU WHICH ONES YOU THINK ARE THE THE ONES THAT YOU SHOULD. UNFUNDED WE DO THINK THAT THAT GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE WE SHOULD CONSIDER ADDING ADDITIONAL ONES OKAY. LET ME ASK YOU JUST A QUESTION RIGHT THERE SO CERTAINLY WE SEE THE LIST ON ON THE STAFF REPORT. AND. YOU KNOW THEY ALL SEEM LIKE WITHOUT PROJECTS ANOTHER MANY OTHERS I'M JUST CONFUSED HOW COULD WE APPROVE THEM. IF THE BONDS HAVE TO BE. SOLD BY THE GOVERNOR SO HOW DOES THAT HELP IF WE APPROVE IT BUT THE. COVER DOES NOT TAKE THE FINAL ACTION. BECAUSE I GET TO. RIDE THE GOD IS ONE OF THE TOWNS DIDN'T NOT NONE OF THIS CAN HAPPEN COMPLETELY YET UNILATERALLY I THINK THERE IS. THAT THE LEGISLATURE CABIN IN THE BUDGET APPROPRIATE. BOND FUNDS FIVE FOR THIS PURPOSE BUT IT DOES REQUIRE THEN THE ADMINISTRATION YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT TURNED TO SELL THESE BONDS SO THERE DOES NEED TO BE SOME COORDINATION. INVOLVED ARM IN AND AND I THINK IF I'M THAT THAT WOULD BE A PART OF THE THE THE TIME THAT WE DO THINK THAT IF YOU YOU DO ADD. BUT THE BILL LANGUAGE OR OTHER LANGUAGE THAT MAKES VERY CLEAR YOUR INTENT BUT THROUGH. COULD BE GREENER. CERTAINTY THAT THESE PROJECTS WOULD BE ULTIMATELY APPROVED UNFUNDED I'M TO THE PROCESS. YEAH I'M SO IF I CAN JUST ADD ON THAT SO WHILE THE PROJECTS LISTED JUST DON'T DON'T. DON'T REALLY FIT WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION'S CRITERIA OR ULTIMATELY THAT FALL WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S ABILITY TO SUSTAIN OR VETO PROJECT. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE SUSTAINED WE WOULD EXPECT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROJECTS AND THEN AS NECESSARY SO THOSE BONDS. OKAY COMMUNITY COLLEGES PERFECT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR CHRISTIAN OSPINA WITH THAT COMPANY COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. UP WE APPRECIATE THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT NEARED AGENDA OF OUR REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS ON BEHALF OF BOARD OF GOVERNORS. IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY AS SECURING FUNDING FOR THE PROP PROJECTS WERE PUT INTO THE IN THE SYSTEMS BUDGET REQUEST. AS OUR AGENDA NOTES I AM PREPARING ARE SOME MIDDLE FOR ADOPTION BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE FOCUSED ON PROJECTS THAT WERE UNFUNDED AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. SO THOSE REPRESENT OUR HIGHEST PRIORITIES OF THE PROJECTS IN THE QUEUE. OUR PROPOSAL INCLUDES THIRTY PROJECTS FIFTEEN CONTINUING PROJECTS AND FIFTEEN NEW PROJECTS BUT ONE WAS WITHDRAWN RECENTLY. AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FUNDS ONLY FIVE OF THEM SO WE'RE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION A JUSTIFIABLE WE HOPE SOME ADDITIONAL PROJECTS ARE INCLUDED IN THEIR SPRING PROPOSALS. BUT ARE ASKING THIS BUDGET PROCESS IS THAT YOU APPROVE THE REMAINING PROJECTS NOT REQUEST. AND I WANNA MAKE SURE TO REITERATE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEED IN OUR SYSTEM. OUR FIVE YEAR PLAN WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS LAST FALL PROJECTS IN NEED OF TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD. FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. OF THAT ABOUT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF NEW FACILITIES ABOUT TWELVE BILLION IS FOR MODERNIZATION OF EXISTING FILLED FACILITIES. OVER TEN YEARS WE ESTIMATE THAT NEED GROWS TO ABOUT FORTY TWO BILLION. AND SO AS YOU KNOW MEETING INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS A RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S BEEN SHARED BY THE STATE IN THE DISTRICTS. AND WE ACCOUNT FOR THAT WE ASSUME THAT ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF THE NEED IS ADDRESS WITH LOCAL FUNDS. AND ACCOUNTING FOR. LOCAL FUNDS AND PROP FIFTY ONE BOND FUNDS WE ESTIMATE IN OUR PLAN THAT WE'D NEED ABOUT SEVENTEEN BILLION IN ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. SO AS I DISCUSSED IN A PREVIOUS HEARING OVER THE LONGER TERM WE THINK A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO BEST MEET THOSE NEEDS MAKE SENSE. YOU KNOW CHANCELLOR OAKLEY'S BEEN WILLING TO REFORM EXISTING PRACTICES IN OTHER AREAS TO MEET THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. AND WE. WE HOPE TO WORK WITH YOU IN THIS AREA TO SEVER WE THINK THIS IS A SHORT TERM CONVERSATION IN THE BUDGET ABOUT GETTING THE PROJECTS FUNDED BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE A LONG TERM CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO MEET. INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS FOR APOLOGIES. THANK YOU. WE HAVE A MEMBERS THE ONE THAT SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE FROM THE PUBLIC. WELL. THANK YOU I CHAIR MEMBERS MARK MCDONALD WITHOUT MCCALLUM GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE LOS RIOS SAN DIEGO. NOT SENTENCING TO ON YUBA COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. I THINK YOUR ANALYSIS DOES A VERY GOOD JOB OF LAYING OUT THE ISSUE. THE. BOARD OF GOVERNORS HAS A COMPETITIVE PROCESS THAT SELECTS THE PROJECTS AND HAS KNOWN TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND SO WE SUPPORT THAT PROCESS AND WOULD SUPPORT YOU APPROVING ALL OF THESE PROJECTS ONCE AGAIN AS HE DID LAST YEAR THANK YOU. IS THE CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS PABLO MONS ASSOCIATE VICE CHANCELLOR FACILITIES MANAGEMENT FOR THE LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT I'M HERE TO URGE YOU TO FUND ALL FOURTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGE AT CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS RECOMMENDED BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THIS WOULD INCLUDE FUNDING OUR NATOMA CENTER PROJECT. IS LOCATED ADJACENT TO ENTER COME HIGH SCHOOL. OF SO THE ADDITION OF CLASSES AND SERVICES OFFERED IS A RESULT OF THE PROJECT'S COMPLETION WOULD ALLOW THE COLLEGE TO EXPAND SUCCESSFUL COLLABORATION WITH THE HIGH SCHOOL THAT PROVIDES A PATHWAY TO COLLEGE WIENER COME STUDENTS. AS WELL AS WORKING ADULTS THE NATOMA CENTERS IS POSITION TO LEAD OUR DISTRICT AND EFFORTS IN INTEGRATING DUAL ENROLLMENT GUIDED PATHWAYS COLLEGE PROMISED AN INNOVATIVE NEW APPROACHES TO OUR PARTNERSHIP. THEREFORE THE CENTER'S UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP A NEIGHBOR INCOME HIGH SCHOOL COMBINED WITH ITS TRACK RECORD IT INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO FACILITATING STUDENT SUCCESS. MAKE THIS THE IDEAL NEW FACILITY. AN IDEAL LOCATION TO INTEGRATE THESE IMPORTANT STATE REFORM INITIATIVES SO WE ASK THAT YOU HONOR THE WILL OF THE VOTERS AND FUND ALL FOURTEEN OF THESE PROJECTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON REBEKAH CURLY ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACILITY COALITION WE ARE ALSO URGING YOU TO FUND ALL FOURTEEN OF THE NEW CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS IN THE EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR. AS RECOMMENDED BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WHEN VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE THAT THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT THEY AUTHORIZED FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WAS FOR CONSTRUCTION. RENOVATION RECONSTRUCTION AND THE EQUIPPING OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACILITIES SO AS YOU CAN SEE THAT'S MUCH BROADER THAN JUST THE NARROW HEALTH AND SAFETY LANDS THAT FINANCES USING. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ALWAYS PRIORITIZES HEALTH AND SAFETY FIRST THOUGHTS THAT FIRST CATEGORY THAT THEY FIND SO WE BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULD BE HONORING THE WILL OF THE VOTERS BY APPROVING ALL FOURTEEN PROJECTS WE THINK THAT THE COSTS OF DELAY. OUTWEIGH ANY POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF WEEDING INCREASING INTEREST RATES CONSTRUCTION COSTS WALL DECREASE YOUR PURCHASING POWER AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO I'M A ESSENTIALLY FUND FEWER PROJECTS WITH YOUR TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO LONGER THAT YOU MIGHT. THINK YOU. SIMPLICITY ON BEHALF OF FACULTY ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ENERGY TO OUT FULLY FUNDED THE FOURTEEN PROJECTS THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING JENNIFER BAKER AT THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION ALSO REPRESENTING THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT OF MOVING THESE PROJECTS FOR WORD WE CONCUR THAT WE NEED TO SEE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM PROP FIFTY FOUR FIFTY ONE RELEASE AND WE THINK THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDED. WITHIN STOP AND ON THE LA EL IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ADEQUATELY REFLECTED DIRECTION OF THE VOTERS THANK YOU. AFTERNOON LIZETTE EVER WITH THE CAMINO COLLEGE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA ONE ALIGN MY. POINTS WITH A LOT OF THOSE THAT ALREADY MENTIONED IF YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT OVERALL THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ANTICIPATE TO A TWENTY NINE POINT NINE BILLION IN FACILITIES NEEDS. WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR A SMALL PORTION OF THOSE AND AGREED THAT I'M OUR COLLEGES ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE INCREASING COSTS OF CONSTRUCTION THE LONGER WE WAIT FOR THESE PROJECTS TO BE RELEASE OF THANK YOU. AGAIN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE LAST YEAR. OKAY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MR MESSAGE. AND EIGHT RESPONSE SITE I THINK I KNOW YOUR ANSWER BETTER. THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE CONSERVE ONLY GONNA GET HIGHER. YEAH I MEAN. THANK THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND AND WHILE WE DO REALIZE THERE IS. THAT THERE IS INFLATION OVER TIME OF OUR PRIORITIES IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MOST CRITICAL PROJECTS. SO WE'RE AT THIS TIME ONLY ABLE TO SUPPORT THOSE UNDER FIRE LIFE SAFETY. SURE AND I I GUESS THAT MAY BE A FOLLOW UP. TO THAT IS THAT. YEAH THAT THAT MEASURE PASS IN THE BONDS HAVE BEEN ISSUED SO THERE'S JUST THIS. GAP THAT'S JUST WAITING AND SO THIS IS THAT LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR'S TERM SO. IS IT IS YOUR INDICATION THAT FUTURE GOVERNORS WOULD FOLLOW THE SAME DESIRE WITH THEY. YOU KNOW OR DID YOU THINK THAT. FINANCE WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. I I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE DIRECTION OF FUTURE GOVERNOR SARAH BUT IS IT THE GOVERNOR'S DESIRE TO TO JUSTIFY AND. LIFE AND SAFETY PROJECTS AND AND NOTHING ELSE AND JUST. BUT TO THE NEXT UP THROUGH THE NEXT ROUND BECAUSE THAT THE. CAPACITY FOR. THE STATE TO ISSUE THE BONDS PASTOR REMAINS. WHAT CHANGES A YEAR FROM NOW? YEAH AGAIN. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE DIRECTION THAT THE PROVIDED BY FUTURE GOVERNOR. AND IN DEFEAT IT BUT I I DO THINK WAS IT AS A GOOD POINT AS COSTS GO UP BUT. NOW INTEREST RATES GO UP AND THE FED RAISED INTEREST RATES THIS MORNING. SO IF YOU WERE GOING TO DO THESE PROJECTS EVENTUALLY IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO YOU WANNA DO THEM NOW WHEN IT'S. WHEN IT'S CHEAPER TO ASK TO BORROW MONEY RIGHT. UP POTENTIALLY ON THERE COULD BE SOME CONCERNS ON HOW SHARP SPIKE AND THEN BONDS COULD BE VIEWED. BASED ON. CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL CAP FOR A GIVEN A GEO BOND SALE. OKAY. THANK YOU YOU DOING YOUR JOB YOU'RE DOING WELL. I. OKAY WELL WE WE RESPECTFULLY I DISAGREE AND WE KNOW THAT WE CAN PUSH. SOME THESE PROJECTS FOR WOULD JUST ME WE DO SO BUT REALIZE IN THE DAY. IT'S ON IT'S THE THE ADMINISTRATION. AND THEIR AND THEIR ROLE AS FAR AS ISSUE. THANK YOU. SO WITH THAT LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO IN THIS IS THAT. NOW LET'S TAKE THEIR OFFERS. MCCARTY HERE. OBERNOLTE. MURATSUCHI. VOEPEL. OKAY THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER TWO THAT THAT CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE FUNDING IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE REALLY. INTRIGUED ABOUT TO PUSH LAST YEAR AND WAS. PLEASE A THAT WAS IN IN THE FINAL. BUDGET ACTION BUT WE WERE ABLE TO TACKLE IT THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS LATER IN THE YEAR. SO WITH WITH THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR IMPLEMENTATION THAT. AND. CERTAINLY SUPPORT THIS EFFORT TO WANTED TO GIVE THAT PERMIT A FINANCING THE COMMITTEE CALLED AS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO TALK ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION. STARTING WITH THIS YEAR SO LET'S START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I HAVE READ SO HE SAT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES FORTY SIX MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB NINETEEN AND CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE CONSISTENT WITH AB NINETEEN COLLEGES COULD USE THIS FUNDING TO WAIT SOME. OR ALL OF THE FORTY SIX DOLLAR PER UNIT FEE FOR ALL FIRST TIME I RESIDENTS STUDENTS ENROLLED IN AT TWELVE UNITS OR MORE PER SEMESTER DURING THE FIRST YEAR. AND TO SUPPORT PROMISE SEEN OUR PRACTICES TO ADVANCE AS SPECIFY STUDENT SUCCESS SCHOOLS. WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WHILE THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE CURRENTLY DEFINES FULL TIME* OF. CREDIT UNITS UP PURSE MASTER. STUDENT CREATED THIRTY UNITS THIRTY PROGRAM APPLICABLE UNITS PER YEAR TO GRADUATE IN TWO YEARS SO THE ADMINISTRATION EXPECTS THAT ONCE COMMITTEE COLLEGES IMPLEMENT GUIDED PATHWAYS. AT THAT ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO TAKE. FIFTEEN UNITS PER SEMESTER THIRTY I UNITS PER YEAR I'VE TO FURTHER ENCOURAGE THAT TIMELY COMPLETION. THINK UN HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. AND WHAT ABOUT WHAT THE LA WHAT WE DID HAVE ANY A PARTICULAR CONCERNS HERE WITHOUT THE ESTIMATES ARE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET REASONABLE AND ARE IN LINE WITH THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION. AND CHRISTIAN ALSO UNDER THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HOLDERS TALKED BRIEFLY ABOUT METHODOLOGY WHILE WE'RE STILL FINALIZING OUR APPROACH. BUT OUR PLAN IS TO DISTRIBUTE FUNDSTO COLLEGES BASED ON THEIR COUNTS OF FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT ALREADY COVERED BY THE FEE WAIVER. IN THE YEAR FOR WHICH FUNDS ARE BUDGETED SO FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE DISTRIBUTE FUNDS USING TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN COUNTS. OUGHT TO DO SO WILL NEED A MECHANISM TO ADJUST OUR APPORTIONMENT SPIT LE AS THOSE NUMBERS. HAVE BECOME FINALIZED OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR OF THE FLEXIBILITY IN THE THEIR PROPRIOCEPTIVE. AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ALLOWS IS FOR US TO DO THAT HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT OTHER MECHANISMS AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU AUTHOR WITH A FEW SO CERTAINLY. AGAIN. VERY PLEASED BY THIS I THINK IT'S A. GAME CHANGER MAKING COMMUNITY COLLEGE. FREE ON TO THE TO THE MASSES IN GRAD STUDENTS COULD GO GET THE. FORMALLY BOB WEAVER BUT THE YEARS I THINK THIS THE GREAT. MARKETING OPPORTUNITY TALK ABOUT COLLEGE PEOPLE WHO. MAYBE NECESSARILY WERE SITTING ON THE SIDELINES WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY IN ONLINE DISCUSS WE NEED TO GET. STRANDED POPULATION AS FAR AS HIGHER EDUCATION BACK IN THE GAME IN A ROLLING IN THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE I THINK THIS HAS. A TREMENDOUS. UPSIDE AND I DID WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE. THE ACTIVITIES THAT THAT WERE LAID OUT IN THAT LEGISLATION OF COURSE SO. I HAVE HAD HOW. HOW DO YOU FOLLOW UP TO MAKE SURE THAT? THE COLLEGE AND COMPLETED THE ACTIVITIES AS FAR AS ELSA BELIEVES IN THAT KIND OF THINK THAT NUMBER ONE THE NUMBER TWO. IS IT PER THE COLLEGE. DISTRICT OR THE ACTUAL INDIVIDUAL COLLEGE. THE OUR INTENT RIGHT NOW WE'VE BEEN AYE TRACKING ON A COLLEGE BASIS. AND SO COLLEGES I THINK THE TWO THAT ARE. HAVE BEEN. OF PRIMARY CONCERN HAVE BEEN AROUND THE PARTICIPATION IN THE FEDERAL LOAN PROGRAM. AS A HAVE THE UPDATE I RECEIVE TODAY THINK RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TWENTY TWO COLLEGES I CAN SYSTEM OF YOUR AGENDA THAT. JIM DON'T CURRENTLY PARTICIPATE IN THE LOAN PROGRAM I THINK MOST OF THOSE ARE EXPLORING PARTICIPATION BUT WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT AND WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU. WITH UPDATED INFORMATION IS THAT MOVES FORWARD. THE OTHER ONE THAT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO US IS PARTICIPATION IN THE GUIDED PATHWAYS STRUCTURE THE FRAY OFF FOLLOWING THAT FRAMEWORK. OF AT THIS POINT MOST CALL IT ALL COLLEGES HAVE INDICATED THAT THEIR. GOING DOWN THAT PATH I THINK THE EXPECTATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW MOVING FORWARD AND SO WILL WE'RE GONNA BE MONITORING THAT BUT I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS THAT. AS WE BUILD AND. YOU KNOW COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS WHO ENTER. ON A PATHWAY TO SUCCESS SO. I THINK WE WE SEE THAT IS CRITICAL TO THE PROGRAM WE THINK WE'RE ON. GOING DOWN THE RIGHT PATH WE'RE GONNA MONITOR THAT. SO THE ONLY THAT ACTIVITY THAT MAYBE QUESTION RIGHT NOW ARE THESE COLLEGES THAT THAT HAVE NOT PARTICIPATED WITH THAT. FEDERAL LOAN THAT'S CORRECT AND JUST JUST MAYBE COULDN'T HELP US WHY WOULD A COLLEGE. NOT HAVE BEEN DOING THIS ALL THESE YEARS. THIS IS ANECDOTAL AND CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW HAVEN'T TALKED BROADLY ENOUGH I THINK. ONE IS KIND OF. BELIEFS ABOUT LOANS AND AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERN ABOUT. LOAN PRACTICES AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT I THINK THE OTHER. IS ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S TIED TO PRODUCE MISSION IN THE FEDERAL LOAN PROGRAMS AND NOT. NOT WANTING SAID TO TAKE ON. THAT HAVE A POPULATION OF STUDENTS WHO ARE TAKING A LOANS WHERE. COHORT DEFAULT RATES ARE USED AS A MEASURE OF INSTITUTIONAL SUCCESS I THINK THE THIRD PART IS ALSO JUST THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF. SPENDING THE LOAN PROGRAM. LOANS ARE AREN'T ALWAYS PROUD LED THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE AS MUCH AS YOU SEE THIS IS HERE PRAISE APPLE IT JUST WASN'T A PRIORITY. BUT AND AND I THINK THE I THINK THE BE BIGGER ISSUE IS PROBABLY THAT IT CREATES BURDENS BOTH ON. THE CAN OF A WORKLOAD STAFFING BURDEN BUT ALSO IN A. A CONCERN THAT INSTITUTIONS WHO HAVE HIGH COHORT DEFAULT RATES. LIKE. THERE ARE PUT POLICIES TIED TO TO THAT MEASURE AND SO WE COULD. GET THEM IN TROUBLE FOR THE PURPOSES OKAY. QUESTIONS FOR MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HOW DO WE. YEAH MISS WALDRON. SO I WAS INTERESTED TO READ IN THE LA NEWS ANALYSIS OF THIS THEIR THE CONCERN ABOUT THE PERENNIAL TENSION BETWEEN. WANTING TO GRAB MORE STUDENTS ACCESS TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ON THE ONE HAND BUT ALSO NEEDING TO ENSURE STUDENT SUCCESS ON THE OTHER HAND BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY DOES US NO GOOD AS A SOCIETY. TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE COME IN NOW IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN WHAT THEY'RE ENDEAVORING TO ACHIEVE SO I AND WHAT AS YOU KNOW WE ALREADY STRUGGLING WITHOUT OF THE LIGHTED LATEST STATISTICS I READ. SAY THAT FOR ONLY FORTY PERCENT AND PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS THAT COME IN EITHER. ACHIEVE A TWO YEAR DEGREE. IN AN EDUCATIONAL CERTIFICATE OR TRANSFER OUT TO HAVE HIGHER. INSTITUTION WITHIN SIX YEARS SO YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S. REALLY A RED FLAG IN MY MIND AND SO FAR. I'M WONDERING HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LARGE NEW INFLUX IN FIRST YEAR STUDENTS TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. IF I HAVEN'T MENTIONED IT YET I THINK THIS IS KIND OF YOU KNOW. THEIR VISION FOR SEX SUCCESS BECOMES KIND OF OUR HAS BEEN OUR. TENTATIVE YOU KNOW NORTH STAR OVER THE PASSING OF SINCE IT WAS ADOPTED LAST YEAR I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW I. I THINK WE WOULD SAY WE DON'T SEE THESE TWO PRIORITIES AS INTENTION THAT I THINK. ACCESS IS IMPORTANT IT'S HISTORICALLY BEEN IMPORTANT AS IMPORTANT AS PART OF A MASTER PLAN. BUT THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE AND WE HAVE. THERE WE HAVE MADE OUR CORE. OUT MISSION OVER THE NEXT COMING YEARS IN THIS CHANCELLOR HAS MADE HIS CORE MISSION TO ADDRESS THESE. CHALLENGES OF STUDENT SUCCESS THAT IT'S YOU KNOW OUR VISION FOR SUCCESS SCHOOLS ORDER INCREASE TRANSFERRING COMPLETE DIED INCREASED COMPLETIONS DE PEOPLE INTO THE WORKFORCE AND. AREAS THAT ARE. CONSISTENT WITH THEIR PROGRAM OF STUDY AND CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS BOTH. ACROSS A STUDENT. RACIAL ETHNIC GROUPS BUT ACROSS ALSO. REGION SO I THINK THIS IS KIND OF A CENTRAL PART OF THIS GUIDED PATHWAYS IS THE WAY IN WHICH WE HAVE. YOU KNOW STRUCTURED OUR SYSTEM TO DEATH THERE THAT ARE YOU KNOW GUIDED PATHWAYS IS THAT IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO MOVE FROM. THE KIND OF AYE CAFETERIA STYLE MODEL OF OF EDUCATIONAL DELIVERY. TO ONE THAT IS FOCUSED ON IDENTIFYING WITH THE STUDENTS EDUCATIONAL GOAL IS UPON ENTRY. CREATING A PATHWAY FOR THEM TO GET THEIR PROVIDING THE SPORTS THING NEED TO DO THAT SO THAT SO I WOULD SAY THIS IS OUR THAT IS OUR CENTRAL MISSION I THINK GETTING MORE FOLKS THROUGH THE DOORS IS IMPORTANT BUT WE. WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THEY GET OUT WITH A WITH A DOT COM. BUT THE DEGREE CREDENTIAL TRANSFER. WHATEVER THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOAL WAS. WELL I MEAN WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM OBVIOUSLY WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING WHICH IS TO PROVIDE THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF ACCESSIBILITY TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM ON THE ONE HAND. AND THE MAXIMUM SUCCESS FOR STUDENTS ON THE OTHER BUT. I HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH YOU THAT THIS IS NOT THIS INFLUX OF NEW STUDENTS IS NOT GOING TO AFFECT OUR SUCCESS RATE IN FACT. IF YOU WANT MY PREDICTION I THINK THAT THAT READ THE FORTY SEVEN PERCENT RATE THAT I JUST COULD I THINK THAT'S GONNA GO DOWN. AS A RESULT OF THIS INITIATIVE AND I THINK IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL. THAT IT'LL GO DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY SO I I MYSELF AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING SURE. THAT WE DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE HERE WHICH IS NOT TO HAVE A BUNCH A PEOPLE GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUT TO HAVE THEM BE SUCCESSFUL. AND THAT'S WOMAN WHEN YOU'RE GAUGING THE OVERALL HEALTH OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE SOCIETY SOCIETAL BENEFIT THAT WERE ACHIEVING. THAT SHOULD BE THE METRIC THAT WERE FOCUSED ON NOT NUMB THE NUMBER FOR STUDENTS TO COME IN BUT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO WHO LEAVE SUCCESSFULLY. AND IT ALL AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT I THINK THAT THAT'S THE METRIC WE OUGHT BE LOOKING AT. SO IT A FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO THE OHIO. ON THE THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA DOES THIS HELP ADDRESS YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE LINK BETWEEN THOSE TWO NUMBERS. BUT IN TERMS OF THE THE FUNDING FOR MEDICAL WE THINK THAT IS A WAY TO HELP ENSURE THAT REGARDLESS WITH HAPPENING ON THE IN ROOM INSIDE. KNOW WHETHER REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE COMING AND WHETHER THEY'RE COMING IN BECAUSE OF VERY RECEIVE A FEW WAIVER OR. YOU KNOW UNDER EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WOULD NOW RECEIVE THE WAIVER THAT WE DO HAVE A INSTANCES FOR COLLEGES TO REALLY FOCUS ON OUTCOMES SO. I THINK I'M. WE DON'T THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE OR THE OTHER WE WE THINK IF YOU DO HAVE A FUNDING FOR MY THAT'S MORE ALIGNED. TO. YEAH AND FOCUSED ON HOW STUDENT SUCCESS THEN YOU CAN. IS SURE THAT COLLEGES ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION PROVIDING THE SUPPORT AND I THINK THE REQUIREMENT OF GUIDED PATHWAYS WITHIN THE MISSIVE IT WITH THAT MAYBE NINETEEN ALSO. HELPED WITH THAT THEY CUT THE COLLEGES QUIRK WHO AGREED TO TAKE THE FUNDING IN AND ALLOW OTHER STUDENTS TO COMMIT ARE ALSO AGREEING. TO DO TO IMPLEMENT GUIDED PATHWAYS TO TRY TO HELP SUPPORT SOON SO WHEN THEY COME IN THEY HAVE BETTER DIRECTION IN TERMS OF WHAT THEIR EDUCATION PLANS AND HOW THEY WANT TO. ABOUT WHAT THEIR GOALS ARE SUBJECT BE COULD HELP SUPPORT THE MISSION THAT THE COMPLETE. ALRIGHT WELL I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT OVERALL IF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE ACHIEVES A HIGHER NUMBER OF STUDENTS. THAT ARE SUCCESSFULLY GETTING THROUGH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THEN WE ALL WENT. BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON THAT OBJECTIVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU ANY. YEAH PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS MARK MCDONALD MCCALLUM GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE A NUMBER OF LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. INCLUDING LAS RIOS. SAN DIEGO SAN FRANCISCO ONE OF FIRST DIVE THANK THE CHAIR IN THIS COMMITTEE. REGARDING THEIR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE LAST YEAR. WE THINK THAT THIS IS A GREAT PROPOSAL AND WOULD URGE YOU TO FIND THAT WE ALSO SUPPORT. THE METHODOLOGY THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS USING TO DISTRIBUTE THE FUNDS WE THINK THAT THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO IT. MISTER OBERNOLTE TO ADDRESS YOUR CONCERNS AT THE END OF. THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION LAST YEAR. THERE WAS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE STATE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO IMPLEMENT STUDENT SUCCESS PURPOSE PROCEDURES IN ORDER FOR THE COLLEGES TO RECEIVE THESE FUNDS AND THOSE ARE INCLUDED IN AB NINETEEN. WHICH WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED HERE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CHAIR MEMBERS ALL HUDDLED AROUND WHAT THE WYOMING GROUP REPRESENTING NEXT AND CALIFORNIA WE SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN M. WERE VERY. UCH IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL THINKING. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAMES KAI JACKSON WITH SINGLE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL TO FUND THE. COMMUNITY COLLEGES PROMISE A WE HAVE A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SAN DIEGO A COMMUNICABLE EDGES DISTRICT AND WE ANTICIPATE A ABOUT THREE THOUSAND SEND YOU UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT STUDENTS. MOVING ON THIS YEAR TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SUCCESSFULLY EXITING THE PROGRAM AND WE JUST WANTED TO OUR EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT OF THE. THE STAFF'S COMMENTS THAT THIS FUNDING OF COMMUNICABLE IS PROMISES IS A CRITICAL STEP TO INCREASING ACCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND DATA THIS IS THAT AN ITEM THAT WE'RE GONNA. FINALIZED LATER IN THE BUDGET PROCESS TO HOLD THIS ISSUE A BUT I JUST I WILL NOTE TO MISTER OBERNOLTE. WHAT ONE OF THE? ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT LAST YEAR DURING THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND DURING THE BILL CAME UP TO MR SANTIAGO. ALWAYS. IS THAT HAVING IT FOCUSED ON FULL TIME. PARTICIPATION HAD A DRAMATIC INCREASE AND IN SUCCESS OF STUDENTS WHO GO PART TIME FORGET THE NUMBER BUT THERE. ACCESS RATE WAS I BELIEVE NO LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE THIRTY PERCENT SUITS TO GO FULL TIME. WAS GONE NORTH OF OF A FIFTY PERCENT I BELIEVE AND SO THE THAT THE THOUGHTS HERE IS. HOW PEOPLE COME IN? AT THE GATE AND TO HAVE IT FREE AND FULL TIME WILL PUT THEM ON A BETTER. PATH TO SUCCESS AN ADDITION TO THAT STUDENT SUCCESS MEASURES WHICH A PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION AS WELL. WITH HER SO THANK YOU. YES I ISSUE NUMBER THREE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AT RIGHT SO TO KEY SO WITH THAT DEPARTMENT FINANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS PROPOSES A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE POINT TWO MILLION I'VE PROPOSITION AT GENERAL FUND. AYE PROPOSITION EIGHT EIGHT GENERAL FINANCE AS SETTLE UP ONE TIME FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND INSTRUCTIONAL EQUIPMENT FOR THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES. AND CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR YEARS IN ADDITION TO SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE COLLEGES COULD USE THESE FUNDS FOR HAS ARE HAZARDOUS STEPS AND THE BEAT MEN ARCHITECTURAL BARRIER REMOVAL PROJECTS WATER CONSERVATION PROJECTS AND LIBRARY MATERIALS I THINK YOU. THANK YOU LA A. A GROUP BOTH THE LA. I WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING THE GOVERNOR'S UP PROPOSAL AND WE DO THINK THAT THIS HELPS TO PAY DOWN THE EXISTING BACKLOG OF PROJECTS ARE COLLEGES AND ALSO PROVIDES FOR A CHRISTIAN. BY DEDICATING SOME OF THE ONGOING PROBLEM THE EIGHT TO ONE TYPE ACTIVITIES IF THERE IS A DOWNTURN I'M IN IN THE COMING YEAR. I'M WILL ALSO RECOMMEND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE. REJECT SOME OF THE OTHER ONE TIME PROPOSALS IN THE BUDGET OR WANT TO DEDICATE ADDITIONAL ONE TIME FUNDING. IF FROM EIGHTEEN NINETEEN PROP NINETY EIGHT. TO PROVIDE SUCH A CHRISTIAN WE WOULD RECOMMEND ARE DOING SO THROUGH THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ITEM. CHRIS THANK YOU CAN MANY COLLEGES WHICH LOST ONE OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. YOU KNOW I THINK WE. AGREE THAT THIS ADDRESSES AN IDENTIFIED NEED. INTERESTS REPORT ARE AT OFFICE ESTIMATED WORTH MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS IN FACILITIES MAINTENANCE NEEDS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. I JUST KNOW THAT YOUR AGENDA. TALKS ABOUT HOW COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS IN ADDITION TO USING THESE FUNDS FUND. MAINTENANCE FROM GENERAL PURPOSE RESOURCES LOCAL BOND FUNDS AND OTHER PROGRAMS. AND IN YOUR AGENDA NOTES THE ON AND OFF FUNDING FOR THIS CATEGORICAL PROGRAM SO I THINK AS WE HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE FUNDING FORMULA AND RELATED ISSUES WE SHOULD. KEEP IN MIND WHAT KINDS OF INCENTIVES WERE CREATING A ROUTE MAINTENANCE ANOTHER BASIC HOUSE. OKAY. QUESTIONS. YEAH PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE. SEEING NONE EVERYONE LIKES DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND SEEMS TO BE A GOOD USE OF. ONE TIME PROP NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS FOR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO STOP. WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AS WELL. ISSUE NUMBER FOUR INNOVATION AWARDS. AND RIGHT SILKY SO THAT A PRIVATE FINANCE AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO PROVIDE INNOVATION AWARDS TO COMMITTEE COLLEGES AND THESE INNOVATION AWARDS PUT. A FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON INNOVATIONS ARE REDUCE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS FOR STUDENTS FROM TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS AS WELL AS REGIONAL ACHIEVEMENT GAPS CONSISTENT WITH THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. SO AS I'VE ADDED BY CHANCE ROSS MANYA. AB DESCRIBE THAT LAST JULY AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ADOPTED THE VISION FOR SUCCESS AT THE VISION A CALLS FOR THE SYSTEM TO INCREASE COMPLETION AND TRANSFER RATES TO REDUCE. THE NUMBER OF AXIS UNITS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CAREER TECHNICAL STUDENTS TO BECOME EMPLOYED IN THEIR PHILLIP STUDY AND REDUCE EQUITY GAPS AND REGIONAL GAPS ACROSS ALL OF THESE MEASURES. THE PROPOSED INNOVATION AWARDS PROGRAM IS CRAFTED IN THE WAY TO FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON INNOVATIONS THAT REDUCE EQUITY AND REGIONAL GAPS FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS INCLUDING LOW INCOME STUDENTS STUDENTS WERE CURRENT AND FORMER FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. STUDENTS WITH DISABILITY DISABILITIES FORMERLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AND STUDENTS FOR VETERANS I'LL OVER WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF EXISTING EFFORTS TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES AT THE GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM IS FOR PROVIDE COLLEGES. UP FUNDS TO IMPLEMENT INNOVATIONS THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN ABLE TO TEST AND IMPLEMENT. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WOULD ADMINISTER THAT THESE AWARDS AND THE CHANCE OR ON THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS WOULD I MAKE THE AWARDS AND. I ALSO KNOW THAT THERE IS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN THE TRAILER BILL ABOUT GENERALLY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WOULD REPORT ON THE ACTIVITIES SUPPORTED BY THE FUNDS. AND THEY GENERATE FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WOULD REPORT A SUMMARY OF THE OUTCOMES OF THE STUDENT POPULATION AND THE MEASURES THAT WERE USED TO. OUT QUANTIFY THE REDUCTION OR ELIMINATION OF ACHIEVEMENT IN EQUITY GAPS. I THINK YOU. THANK YOU ALEJO. YES WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL I THINK I'M MORE CONCERNED IS THAT IT PROVIDES LARGE SUMS OF. A MONEY TO A SMALL NUMBER OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND WITHOUT REALLY A MECHANISM FOR IF THERE ARE INNOVATIONS FOR DISSEMINATING THEM ACROSS THE STATE. I'M THE COLLEGES ARE IDEA BOMBING A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES MANY OF THESE ARE ALSO INTENDED TO TO. AT REDUCE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS SO WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSAL AND IF YOU DO WANT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR ONE TIME PURPOSES WITH THE RECOMMENDS OF FUNDING ARE. INCREASING THE DEFERMENT THAT. THANK YOU PROFESSOR. ALL PROVIDE BOTH AN OVERVIEW OF OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AWARDS AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND THEN SOME POTS IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL I'M SO IS YOUR AGENDA NOTES AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET APPROPRIATED TWENTY MILLION TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS FOR THESE AWARDS. OF THIS YEAR OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN ON SCALING INNOVATION ALSO THE AWARDS ARE DESIGNED TO SUPPORT BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATIONS A COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE DISTRICTS THAT IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS. DEMONSTRATE REVOLUTIONARY LEARNING YOUR STUDENT SUPPORT MODELS ARE SO STABLE AND CAN BE SCALED REGIONALLY OR THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE EXPECT OF THE AWARDS WILL BE BETWEEN ONE MILLION DOLLARS AND FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEY'RE INTENDED TO HELP RECIPIENTS SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SELECTED PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. THE APPLICATION DEADLINE IS MONDAY WE RECEIVED SIXTY FIVE APPLICATIONS AND OUR OFFICE INTENDS TO BEGIN REVIEWING THEM SHORTLY. AND THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS WILL ANNOUNCE THE WINNERS OF THE MAY MEETING. MOVING OUT OF THE. CURRENT PROPOSAL. YOU KNOW AS WE'VE DISCUSSED THE GOVERNOR BOARD OF GOVERNORS ADOPTS THE BUDGET EACH FALL. AND THIS PROPOSAL WASN'T INCLUDED IN OUR BUDGET WE THINK THOUGH THAT IT SENSIBLE AND SUPPORTS THE GOALS INCLUDED IN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. OF ALSO SAY THAT WE THINK IT'S RES THAT'S A REASONABLE WAY TO SUPPORT CAPACITY BUILDING IN THE SYSTEM ESPECIALLY AS WE DISCUSS ANY FUNDING FORMULA. LAST WEEK WE CONVENED A MEETING OF. US OF RESEARCHERS TO TALK ABOUT. ISSUES RELATED TO THE FUNDING FORMULA AND ONE OF THE MAIN POINTS OF THE RESEARCHERS MADE WAS THAT SUCCESS OF FUNDING FORMULA CHANGES. ARE TYPICALLY RELATED TO THE CAPACITY OF COLLEGES TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES AND SO WE THINK THE INNOVATION WORDS CAN HELP TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY. OKAY. THANK YOU. I LET ME START OUT WITH A QUESTION FOR FROM LA SO THAT I I HEARD YOUR RECOMMENDATION TO. TO OPPOSE THIS AND REDIRECTED TO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND. AND THAT YOU GET THE SAME RECOGNITION YOU HAD A YEARS BACK AND I THINK NOW IS STILL BE DIFFERENT IS. IF YEARS AGO OVERTURE WHAT THEY WOULD DO NOW THEY'VE DONE IT AND WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING SO. THE THE DESCRIPTION FROM THE COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. BREAKTHROUGH PROJECTS REVOLUTIONARY PROJECTS. HAVE WE HAVE WE SEEN ANY OTHER ONES IN LAST YEAR'S THAT THAT THAT MEET UP WITH THAT. THOSE LOFTY GOALS WE HAVE AND THE LIVING YET I THINK THERE PUT THE FOR THE FIRST RIGHT MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRST ROUND OF INNOVATION AWARDS WERE REALLY ABOUT. BROUGH WORDING. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THAT WERE ALREADY AND. HAD ALREADY ADOPTED INNOVATIVE PRACTICES SO THAT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WE THOUGHT. WE CHANGE I THINK THAT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT FINANCES IN THE MYTH OF COMPILING I'M INFORMATION FROM THE THE FIRST ROUND OF. A BECAUSE THAT RECEIVED THE INNOVATION AWARDS. WHERE WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO THAT IMPLEMENT SOMETHING NEW SO WE HAVE AN SEEN ANYTHING QUITE YET THAT GIVES US A SENSE OF? WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE WORDS I AM WHAT THE OUTCOMES BEEN AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY OF THAT HAS HAS KIND OF? BEEN DISSEMINATED ACROSS THE STATE. OKAY AND THEN FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THIS WASN'T IN THE COMMUNICATIVE BUDGET REQUEST. WHAT WAS THE REASON THAT THAT? IF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE SITE THIS WITH. WHERE THE END OF INCLUSION IN THE BUDGET? SO THAT WE THE WAY WE'VE AFTER THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS THAT THIS PROPOSAL ALIGNS WITH THE GOALS OF THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. AND WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT INNOVATION IS IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS. ACHIEVEMENT GAPS FOR INSTANCE WE SEE A LOT OF INNOVATIONS THAT STAR AT. COLLEGE LEVEL AT THINGS LIKE THE COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM MULTIPLE MEASURES AND THEN I HAVE HAD THE POTENTIAL BEING SCALED. ACROSS. AT THE SYSTEM AND WE OFTEN HEAR THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO INNOVATE AND TO TEST NEW IDEAS AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL SO THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT BRINGS TOGETHER STAFF FACULTY. AN OPPORTUNITY TO. RECEIVE A GRANT TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING NEW SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO ADDRESS. VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUES LIKE ACHIEVEMENT GAP SO WE REALLY SAW THIS ALIGNED. OUT WITH THE VISION FOR SUCCESS IN THOSE SCHOOLS AND THAT GOOD USE OF ONE TIME FUNDING. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEE. ARTS ITCHING. I SEE THAT. THIS STAFF REPORT INDICATES THAT THERE WAS WITH TO BE A. REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE. INTENDED TO SHOW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRST ROUND OF INNOVATION AWARDS. YES THERE WERE IN THE PROCESS OF. COLLECTING THAT INFORMATION IN OUR OFFICES. WILL WILL PROPRIETY THAT INFORMATION THIS YEAR. OKAY SEEING NO OTHER. QUESTIONS WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AS WELL. ISSUE NUMBER FIVE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE STAFFING. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARING MCCARTY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MOLLY BECAUSE OF WORK WITH DEPARTMENT FINANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWO MILLION ONGOING NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL STAFFING CAPACITY AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. TO SUPPORT RECENT INITIATIVES AND INVESTMENTS THE STATE HAS MADE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. OUR STAFF REVIEWED RECENTLY ENACTED LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT INVESTMENTS THAT ARE PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. TO IDENTIFY WORKLOAD THAT WOULD FURTHER SUPPORT THE CHANCELLOR'S EFFORTS TO PROVIDE GREATER LEADERSHIP AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS. BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING NEW RESOURCES TO BUILD STAFFING CAPACITY TO HELP ACHIEVE THE GOALS AND PRIORITIES OUTLINED IN THE CHANCELLOR'S MISSION FOR SUCCESS. THESE FUNDED POSITIONS WOULD SUPPORT THE FOLLOWING SEVEN PROGRAM AREAS. ONE POSITION TO COORDINATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSED NEW FUNDING FORMULA. THIS INDIVIDUAL WOULD BE TASKED WITH WRITING THE REGULATIONS PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COLLEGES TO HELP THEM TRANSITION TO THE NEW FORMULA. MONITORING THEIR PROGRESS AND WORKING WITH COLLEGES WHO ARE NOT ACHIEVING STUDENT OUTCOMES. THAT THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA REWARDS. SIX POSITIONS INCLUDING ONE ADMINISTRATOR TO DEVELOP AND SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSED ONLINE COLLEGE. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WILL SEE CONSIDERABLE NEW WORKLOAD AND HELPING THE ONLINE COLLEGE GET UP AND RUNNING. INITIALLY THE ONLINE COLLEGE WILL HAVE NO STAFF AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WILL BE TASKED WITH DEVELOPING THE GUIDING PRACTICES AND PRINCIPLES. WRITING THE NEW REGULATIONS HOPING WITH THE ACCREDITATION PROCESS DOING OUTREACH AND DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE CAREER PATHWAYS THAT THE ONLINE COLLEGE WILL OFFER. AS A ONLINE COLLEGE BECOMES FULLY OPERATIONAL THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WILL HAVE A CONTINUED ROLE IN REVIEWING DATA TO EVALUATE THE SUCCESS OF THE ONLINE COLLEGE. AND HELPING DISSEMINATE THE BEST PRACTICES AND POLICIES OF THE ONLINE COLLEGE TO THE OTHER HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN COLLEGES TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTIVENESS PARTICIPATION INITIATIVE. WE WOULD NOTE THAT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS CAN ONLY BE USED TO PROVIDE LOCAL ASSISTANCE AND THERE'S A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN ACTIVITIES THAT CAN BE FUNDED THROUGH PROP NINETY EIGHT. AND THE ADDITIONAL STATE OPERATIONS WORK LOAD THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WHICH MUST BE SUPPORTED BY NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. OUR PROPOSAL INCLUDES FUNDING TO POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BOMBING OF THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE AB NINETEEN WHICH WE DISCUSSED EARLIER TODAY. THE ADDITIONAL STAFF WOULD DEVELOP REGULATIONS ANDALLOW THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE GREATER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THE LOCAL COLLEGES. AND DETERMINE THE ELIGIBILITY OF COLLEGES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATION REQUIRES COLLEGES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FEDERAL LOAN PROGRAM TO PROVIDE GREATER FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO STUDENTS. AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SHOULD BE HELPING THEM ESTABLISH SUCH A LOAN PROGRAM. ONE POSITION TO SUPPORT COLLEGE EFFORTS TO EFFECTIVELY USE MULTIPLE MEASURES TO BETTER ASSESS IN PLACE STUDENTS INTO COURSES. AS REQUIRED IN AB SEVEN OH FIVE WHICH WAS RECENTLY ENACTED. THIS PERSON WOULD DEVELOP REGULATIONS PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP COLLEGES IMPLEMENT THE NEW MULTIPLE MEASURES. ASSESSMENT AND PLACEMENT PROCEDURES. ONE ADMINISTRATOR IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WORKFORCE AN ECONOMIC DIVISION TO COORDINATE AND SUPPORT THE K. THROUGH TWELVE CT  <u><c.green>COMPONENT OF THE</c></u> STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. TWO POSITIONS TO CONTINUE WORK ON THE GUIDED PATHWAYS IMPLEMENTATION. THIS INITIATIVE WAS INITIALLY FUNDED IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT AND FUNDING WAS PROVIDED FOR ONE ADMINISTRATOR AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. TO COORDINATE GUIDED PATHWAYS ACTIVITIES HOWEVER THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE NEEDS ADDITIONAL STAFFING TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF LOCAL COLLEGES AS THE EMPLOYMENT GUIDED PATHWAYS THAT THEIR CAMPUSES. ONE POSITION EACH IN THE ACCOUNTING AND HUMAN RESOURCES DIVISIONS OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY OF THESE UNITS WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERSTAFFED RESULTING IN DELAYS IN PROCESSING CONTRACTS SUBMITTING REIMBURSEMENT CLAIMS AND HIRING NEW STAFF. THE TWO MILLION WOULD ALLOW THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO FILL FIFTEEN AUTHORIZED BUT VACANT POSITIONS WHICH BE WOULD BE RECLASSIFIED. AND REDIRECTED TO MEET THE PROPOSED STAFFING NEEDS WE'VE DESCRIBED. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAS EXISTING POSITION AUTHORITY FOR THESE POSITIONS BUT NEEDS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO HIRE THE STAFF WE HAVE IDENTIFIED. AS CRITICAL IN HELPING THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SUPPORT LOCAL COLLEGES EFFORTS TO HELP STUDENTS SUCCEED. THANK YOU AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. HOWEVER BOTH LA OR WE HAVE COULD THREE RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THIS. I'M SO WE KIND OF BROKE OUT THESE THE REQUEST IN TERMS OF THREE THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES ONE THIS FUNDING FOR. SERVE EXISTING WORKLOAD TIGHTER INITIATIVES ARE THE ADOPTED. SECOND ONE IS ONLINE COLLEGE IN THE THIRD IS THE FUNDING FOR THE FUNDING FORMULA AND THE CITY E. K. TWELVE CITY. SO ON THE FIRST PIECE FOR FUNDING FOR EXISTING ABOUT WORK WHAT WE WOULD WRECK RECOMMEND REJECTS AND. WE WE DIDN'T GET A LOT OF WORK WITH THE TALENT THAT JUST BY THE ONGOING WORK WOULD NEED. AT THE CHANCES OF US AND WE ARE UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE WAS A REVIEW LAST SPRING AND THAT THAT THERE WERE SOME POSITIONS INCREASED. LAST MAY WHAT WE DO KNOW THAT THE TOUGHEST OPPOSITE INDICATED THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT WAYS THAT THEY MIGHT. RESTRUCTURE THE THOUGH ORGANIZATION TO FURTHER I'M SUPPORT. BECAUSE DISTRICTS AND IF IF THERE IS A MORE DEDUCTIBLES IN THE FUTURE WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER IT. IN TERMS OF THE ONLINE COLLEGE WE WOULD RECOMMEND. WILL NOT PROVIDING ANY STATE OPERATIONS FUNDING RELATED TO ONLINE COLLEGE. A LOT OF THE ACTIVITIES ARE UP TO THOUGHTS ARE MORE THE TYPE OF ACTIVE ACTIVITIES AT A COLLEGE WOULD BE. UNDERTAKING THESE ARE NOT OUR OVERSIGHT ROLE OF THE. OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SO IF THERE IS ANY NEED TO. FOR THAT WORK WHEN WE THINK THAT SHOULD BE FUNDED WITH THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED TO THE COLLEGE SO IF THERE IS CHAPTERS OFFICE STAFF HAVE TO DO WE WOULD RECKON THERE'D BE A REIMBURSEMENT. SOME KIND OF A REIMBURSEMENT MODEL I USE FOR THAT PURPOSE. WEIGHT WITH WITH REGARDS TO THE KEY TO ALL OF A. THE E. PROGRAM POSITION IN THE FUNDING FORMULA WE REDUCE BEHOLD RECOMMENDATION AND THOUGHT THAT THE NEED FOR THOSE POSITIONS WILL REALLY DEPEND. SIGNIFICANTLY ON ULTIMATELY WHAT. WHAT PROPOSALS YOU ADOPT FOR EXAMPLE IN THE FUNDING FORMULA IF YOU HAVE A VERY COMPLICATED MORE COMPLICATED? APPROACH YOU MIGHT BE MORE STUFF THAN JUST ONE UMBER ALTERNATIVELY IF YOU ARE ARE ADOPTING A NEW. FUNNY FOR ME BUT ALSO CONSOLIDATING CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS IN ELIMINATES MOST REQUIREMENTS YOU MIGHT. BE ABLE TO REDIRECT EXISTING POSITIONS ALL ULTIMATELY HOW MANY YOU NEED WILL DEPEND ON THE ULTIMATE POLICIES ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU CHRISTMAS WHEN YOU KNOW THE CHANCES OFFICE WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WE THINK IT REFLECTS THE GROWING ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. PART OF THOSE ARE CHANGES MADE BY THE GOVERNOR OF THE LEGISLATURE IN PART OF THOSE ARE CHANGES IN THE APPROACH BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND CHANCELLOR OAKLEY. ALL KNOW TO FUNDAMENTAL SHIFTS THAT CHANGE OUR THINKING ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE STATE OFFICE THE FIRST AS I MENTIONED IS THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ITS GOALS BUT IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTS COMMITMENTS THAT OUR OFFICE IS MADE. AND AND ONE BIG SHIFT IS A MORE ACTIVE ROLE FOR OUR OFFICE NOT WITH REGARD TO COMPLIANCE. WOULD STATE RULES AND STATE LAWS BUT ON LEADERSHIP SUPPORTING CAPACITY BUILDING DIVISIONS. SAYS IN PART THAT OUR OFFICE WILL FOSTER YOU'D BE USE OF DATA IN KOREAN EVIDENCE TAKE OWNERSHIP OF GOALS AND PERFORMANCE ENABLE ACTION AND THOUGHTFUL INNOVATION AND LEAD THE WORK OF PARKING YOUR CAR CROSS SYSTEMS. THE SECOND SHIFT AGAIN IS SOMETHING WE'VE MENTIONED. AND THAT'S THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GUIDED PATHWAYS FRAMEWORK WHICH YOU SUPPORTED IN THE CURRENT YEAR'S BUDGET. WELL THAT WORK IS BEING DONE AT THE COLLEGES ARE OFFICES ALSO TRYING TO MODEL HOW WE TREAT CLEAR PATHWAYS TO EDUCATIONAL GOALS. ARE ONE EXAMPLE IS THAT WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO TEAR DOWN THE FALSE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN ACADEMIC AFFAIRS AND STUDENT SERVICES. THROUGH THE CREATION OF A NEW EDUCATIONAL SERVICES ORGANIZATION. AND SO THAT WORK IS ONGOING IT MAY ALTER. HOW WE WOULD ALLOCATE THE RESOURCES THAT ARE PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CHANCELLOR OAKLEY HAS BEEN IN ISRAEL FOR MORE THAN A YEAR BUT MANY OF US ON THE TEAM INCLUDING ME? ARE EVEN THEY WERE AND WERE BEGINNING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD THE LINE ALL OF OUR RESOURCES INCLUDING OUR EXISTING RESOURCES BUT ALSO ANY ADDED RESOURCES IN THE BUDGET. TO MEET THE VISION GOALS BOB AS WE GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS WE'RE HAPPY TO REPORT TO YOU. OUR PROGRESS TO YOU ALL AND I THINK WE WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE THE LA DOES POINT THAT. YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC. WORKLOAD JUSTIFICATIONS ON A POSITION BASIS I THINK WE CAN. YOU KNOW. TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT BENCHMARKING AGAINST OTHER ORGANIZATIONS BUT YOU KNOW WE THINK THE NEED IS THERE AND WE HOPE THAT WE CAN I'M JUST FIVE ACT YOU OVER THE COMING MONTHS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ESTIMATES RICHIE. SO. IN TERMS OF THE. K. THROUGH TWELVE. CORD TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM I I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET THE IN MY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS WITH THE FULL. SUPPORT OF THE THE CHANCELLOR. I THINK WE WOULD DEFER TO YOU ON THAT DECISION IT'S A ROLE THAT WE HAVEN'T HISTORICALLY PLAYED WE ARE. WERE HAPPY TO PLAY WHATEVER ROLE THAT. YOU ALL DECIDE I THINK WE AGREE ON THAT. THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AROUND COORDINATION OF K. TWELVE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS AROUND REGIONAL WORKFORCE NEEDS HOW YOU STRUCTURE THAT. YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION. MAINLY WE HAVE I BELIEVE OVER NINE HUNDRED SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YEAH I OKAY AB NINE HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND. AND. IT IT DOESN'T SEEM REALISTIC THAT WE WOULD HAVE WANTED MINUTES STRAIGHTER. FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO COORDINATE THESE REGIONAL CT  <u><c.green>WORK FORCES OR WHERE</c></u> PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT DOES THE CHANCES OFFICE HAVE OPINION ON THAT. ALL I CAN DEFERRED TO THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE. RATIONALE I WOULD SAY THAT. TO THE EXTENT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS CHARGED WITH. ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM I THINK WE WOULD. BELIEVE THAT THERE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES NEEDED IN ANY CASE I THINK WE WOULD RELY HEAVILY ON OUR PART EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS OF THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION. BUT. BUT IF THAT IS A ROLE THAT THAT YOU ALL CHARGES WITH BUT I THINK WE NEED. WILL NEED RESOURCES TO DO THAT. IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU'RE REALLY FIGHT A FIGHT HAD TO NEW ROLE THERE. I THINK WE RESPECT THE FACT THAT THESE ARE FOLKS THAT THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION. WORKS WITH WORKED WITH REGULAR. I THINK THIS IS YOU BRING UP A GOOD POINT MISTER MURATSUCHI THAT A FEW OF THESE ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR OTHER ACTIONS THE ONLINE. DEBATE WHICH. IS A BIG DEBATE AS YOU SAW YESTERDAY. AND AND THEN THE FUNDING FORMULA WHICH WILL GET TO AND THEN THAT THE CT PROPOSAL AND SO I THINK ALIVE THESE. ARE PREMATURE WE WE WE WHAT WE ONE ACT NOW ANYWAY HOLD US OPEN BUT. THAT LOOKS LIKE ABOUT HALF OF THESE ARE PREDICATED BY WHAT WE DO WITH THE OTHER ITEMS. BUT I WILL NOTE THAT THAT THAT YOU KNOW ONE THE REASONS THAT WE LIKE. THE EXISTING STRUCTURE OF THE THINKING PROGRAM GOING THROUGH CD SO NOW. WE HAVE SOME IT'S HARD TO THAT AS WELL. MISTER MARK MISTER BELL PAL. YES ARM. I'M THE NEW GUY ON THE COMMITTEES GO UP STILL TRYING TO CONNECT ALL THE DOTS. THE TWELVE IT'S THE FIFTEEN POSITIONS THEY WERE FUNDED AT ONE TIME WORK THEY. ALL TAKE A STAB AT THE SO I THINK. YES THE ANSWER IS. YOU OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR CONTROL AGENCIES BUDGET INCLUDING OUR AGENCIES TO ISSUE CONTROLLED ON A DOLLAR BASIS IN YOU. ALSO CONTROLLED ON A POSITION BASIS OVER TIME. AGENCY BUDGETS INCLUDING OURS. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS THAT WERE FUNDED AND THE NUMBER AND WHERE THE DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT. BECOMES A LITTLE MORE DISJOINTED SO WE HAVE A POSITION WE HAVE A SITUATION NOW WHERE WE HAVE AUTHORITY TO HIRE. ADDITIONAL POSITIONS BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO FILL THOSE POSITIONS BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW ALONG. A SET OF INCREMENTAL WAYS IN WHICH. THOSE TWO NUMBERS HAVE BECOME MORE DISTORTED OKAY BECAUSE. I SUPPORT THESE FIFTEEN POSITIONS. DRAWING ON PAST EXPERIENCE IN GOVERNMENT. WE WOULD OFTEN USE VACANT POSITIONS TO TRANSFER THAT MONEY TO OTHER USES SO IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED HERE IT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND OVERSIGHT OF JUST INCREMENTAL DECISIONS OKAY AND AND I'M NOT CRITICIZING AT ALL BECAUSE IT'S A NORMAL PRACTICE IN. ANY ORGANIZATION SO JUST SO YOU KNOW I WOULD SUPPORT THE EXCERPTED ADDITIONS ESPECIALLY DEPENDING UPON THE DIRECTION WE GO ON THE ONLINE COLLEGE BECAUSE IF IT'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH ISSUE. AND YOU NEED SUPPORT SO. THIS WEEK THANK YOU FRED SIR. THANK YOU THANK YOU I WILL NOTE THAT RELATIVE LEE NIMBLE TWO MILLION STUDENTS LASTED TWO HUNDRED POSITIONS. UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE. THOUSAND STUDENTS. ABOUT A THOUSAND POSITIONS. NO COMMENT I'M SURE THEIR SWISS. YES BUT THAT KNOW IT'S APPLES AND ORANGES BUTI KNOW THAT. AT THAT TIME. VERY EFFICIENT AT RQ LA CALLED SYSTEM QUESTIONS. OKAY THIS ISSUE AGAIN WILL BE. HELD OPEN LAST ISSUE WE WANTED TO. JUST CIRCLE BACK ON THAT TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT IN THE MONIES WE. WE ARE AND PUT THE BUDGET RELATED TO VETERANS RESOURCE CENTERS. THANK YOU ALL MY COLLEAGUES. WALKING UP ARTISTS MAKE SOME INTRODUCTORY COLUMN COMMENTS WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE'S ACTION WITH REGARD FOR VETERANS STUDENTS. YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT BEYOND VETERAN RESOURCE CENTERS. WE'RE WORKING TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF VETERANS ACROSS ORGANIZATION. THAT WERE SPENDING TIME CONSIDERING HOW WE RECOGNIZE THE KNOWLEDGE SKILLS AND ASSETS THAT VETERANS BRING TO OUR INSTITUTIONS AND AS CHANCELLOR OAKLEY MENTIONED YESTERDAY OUR OFFICES. THINKING ESPECIALLY HARD AYE ABOUT COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION WHICH WE THINK CAN HAVE AN IMPORTANT PACKED FOR VETERANS GIVEN. THE SKILLS THEY'VE LEARNED. WHILE SERVING SOUL INTRODUCED DAVID LAWRENCE WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR VETERANS SERVICES IN OUR OFFICE AND HOPE PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE USE OF FUNDS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN PARTY MEMBERS COMMITTEE APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE TWO FIVE MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATIONS THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET. IN SUPPORT OF THE CREATION OF NEW OR AUGMENTATION OF EXISTING BETTER RESOURCE CENTERS. AS YOU KNOW ONE WAS IN ONGOING FUNDING IN THE OTHER IS A ONE TIME COMPETITIVE GRANT FUNDING. SO ALL START WITH THE ONGOING FUNDING THE. THE BUDGET LANGUAGE AROUND THE ONGOING FUNDED REQUIRED OUR OFFICE TO COME UP WITH THE MINIMUM SAYS STANDARDS FOR HIGH FUNCTIONING BETTER RESOURCE CENTER. SO WE TURN TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE VETERANS SERVICES ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHICH IS MADE UP OF INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE STATE OF THE LOCAL LEVEL. WHO REALLY? ARE LEADING OUR SYSTEM WITH REGARDS TO DEVELOPING BETTER RESOURCE CENTERS PROVIDING SERVICES FOR VETERANS ON CAMPUS. AND THAT GROUP. GOT TOGETHER AND CAME UP WITH THIS MINIMUM SAYS STANDARDS WHICH WE RELEASED TO THE SYSTEM. I'M NOT ONLY DO THEY MEAN DID THEY COME UP WITH THE MINIMUM SAYS STANDARDS THEY ALSO CAME UP OF THE FUNDING FORMULA FOR. DISTRIBUTING THEIR ALLOCATING THAT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING FUNDS. SO. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE FUNDING COLLEGES WERE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A CERTIFICATION FORM THAT INCLUDED THOSE MINIMUM SET THE STANDARDS AND IDENTIFY WHAT STANDARDS THEY CURRENTLY MEET. AND THE THINKING BEHIND THAT WAS THAT IT SHOULD THIS FUNDING CONTINUE WE CAN ASK THEM TO DO THAT FROM YOUR YEAR IN THE COMPARATIVE. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE TO PRIOR TO. ENSURE PROGRESS IS BEING MADE TOWARDS MEETING THOSE STANDARDS. SO WITH REGARDS TO THE FUNDING FORMULA IT WAS FAIRLY SIMPLE THE FIRST YEAR WHEN I TOOK THIS POSITION OVER KNOCKED OVER THE GOAL WAS TO GET THE FUNDING OUT BE THE STATE DEPARTMENT SYSTEM ANNEX OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT WAS IN JANUARY. SO WE QUICKLY CAME UP WITH THAT OF VERY BASIC FORMULA. THE FOR TWENTY PERCENT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A ONE MILLION DOLLARS WAS DIVIDED EVENLY AMONGST EACH COLLEGE AT SOME IS CERTIFICATION FORM REQUESTING FUNDING. THE REMAINING FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WAS ALLOCATED BASED ON. EACH COLLEGES PRO RATED SHARE OF THE TOTAL NUMBER STUDENT VETERANS CERTIFIED BY EVERY COLLEGE THAT SIMILAR CERTIFICATION FORM DURING THE STATE FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. SO THE BASS LIKE OPPONENT WAS THERE TO PROTECT SMALL COLLEGES THAT DON'T SERVE ARE A TON OF VETERANS. AND AND SOME OF THE RESULTS OF THAT ALLOCATION BECAUSE THE FUNDS HAVE BEEN HAVE GONE OUT THEY WENT OUT AS I SAID IN. IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR THE SMALLEST ALLOCATION WAS IN ABOUT TEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE DOLLARS AND WHAT PALAVA DAY. PALO VERDE SERVED. CERTIFIED EIGHT VETERANS DURING THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN FISCAL YEAR SEE MY SAY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IS NOT A LOT OF PETER LAB OR RELEASED BY. HERE ELEVEN ABOUT A RESOURCE. THE LARGEST ALLOCATION WHAT PALOMAR COLLEGE PALOMAR CERTIFIED OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED VETERANS IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND THEY RECEIVED A HUNDRED FIFTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH WAS. YOU KNOW I HEALTHY ALLOCATION. WITH HER GARCIA ONE TIME FUNDING. WE'RE IN THE FINAL STAGES OF COMPLETING THE REQUEST FOR APPLICATION FOR THOSE FUNDS. AND ANTICIPATE RELEASING THAT BY THE END OF MARCH. AND HAVE MEANING GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS OF COLLECTING APPLICATIONS REVIEWED THE SCORE THE APPLICATIONS AND ANNOUNCE THE THE SUCCESSFUL APPLICANTS. I BY THE END OF MAY SO THAT IS THE GOAL WITH REGARDS THE. THE THE GRANT FUNDING AT THIS TIME. OVER ALL THE DO YOU VIEW THAT THERE IS THERE IS THAT THERE'SA NEED OUT THERE IBC SEVENTY THOUSAND. VETERANS AND OUR COMMUNICATIVE AS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER AND THAT I THINK THAT. MORE HELP AND MORE THE MERRIER SO. IF THERE WAS A DESIRE. WHAT KID BUT CAN BE DONE? OFFICIALLY. IN IN THE IN THIS CONTEST FEEL. I ABSOLUTELY THERE'S. I NEED TO ACTUALLY JUST RECENTLY CAN TARGET OF OUR SYSTEM AND OUR NUMBERS OF ACTUALLY SWORN EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND STE IN BETTER AND SO. AS YOU SEE IT'S CLIMBING. NINETY FIVE OR NINETY SEVEN OF OUR COLLEGES ACTUALLY HAVE BETTER RESOURCE CENTERS BUT THE ISSUE IS. SISTERS BEEN A FUNNY PART THIS YEAR THE THERE WILDLY INCONSISTENT IN SIZE AND IN STOPPING AND SERVICES OFFERED. SO I THINK. I THINK THE ONGOING FUNDING IS IS PROBABLY THE MOST EFFICIENT VEHICLE FAR OFFICE TO GET THE FUNDS OUT SO IF THERE WERE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. GRANT FUNDING IS IS IS ALWAYS GREAT BUT IT'S A VERY LABOR INTENSIVE PROCESS TO CREATE THE RFA AND THEN I GET THE PEOPLE YOU NEED TO TO SCORE THOSE AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA GIVE HIM AS MUCH MONEY OUT TO AS MANY PEOPLE SO. I THINK. FROM MY STANDPOINT I WOULD SUGGEST THE ONGOING FUNDING VERSUS GRANT FUNDING SO EVERYBODY GETS A LITTLE BIT OF PIECE OF THE PIE I THINK THAT WOULD. NOT BE THE BEST BUS ROUTE MY OPINION NOW IS THE FOR IS WE AYE WE WANTED AND TOWARD A COMMITTEE BECAUSE THE FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN UP IN ROCKLIN WHAT'S AGAINST TERRORISTS HERE EXACTLY. AND WE WE WENT AND VISITED THAT VETERANS RESOURCE CENTER. AND IT WAS THE FIRST THE OVER THE YEARS I TALKED ABOUT THE FACILITY THAT THEY CAN THAT THEY CREATED THERE AND THEN COURSES STAFFING. SO SOME OF THESE. HUNDRED FIFTEEN OR SO COLLEGES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THAT MAYBE DON'T HAVE IS IS IT REALLY NEED RESOURCES TAKE GREAT IT IS THAT THEY NEED A. SOLELY A PORTABLE BUILDING THERE OR IS IT STAFFING THAT THEY CAN HAVE A PLACE IN EXISTING. COLLEGE CAMPUS WHY ETHNIC A REALIST IT'S ALWAYS. ITO THE TOUGH PART TO GET IS A SPACE ON CAMPUS. YOU KNOW THAT'S TOUGH I YOU KNOW WITH NINETY SEVEN BECAUSE HAVING AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME LEVEL OF SUCCESS HEARING GAINES SPACE ON CAMPUS SO WERE WERE SHORT EIGHTEEN COLLEGES THIS POINT IT WORKS IF. SEVENTEENTH THAT ARE FOURTEEN FIFTEEN ONLINE BUT. SO I THINK JUST. FUNDING TO TO YOU KNOW EXPAND THOSE SINNERS TO YOU KNOW IT AS THE GROUP REALLY. REVISE YOUR GROUP REALLY RECOMMENDS HAVING SEPARATE OFFICES WITHIN THE CENTER SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE PRIVACY FOR COUNSELING OR THE OR BENEFIT CERTIFICATION. AND PROBABLY I WOULD GUESS MANY OF THOSE DON'T HAVE PRIVATE OFFICES SOME MORE ADVANCED ONES DO BUT SO YOU KNOW SOME. TEN PREVENT FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM WOULD WOULD WOULD BE BENEFICIAL BUT THEN ALSO STAFFING. GROUP RECOMMENDED ONE FULL TIME DIRECTOR LATIMER STAFFORD VA WORK STUDY STUDENTS WHICH IS A GREAT PROGRAM BECAUSE WE GET STUDENT VETERANS PAID FOR DOING WORK BUT. YOU CAN'T HAVE A DECENT A COUPLE ERA MAYBE WORKS STAY STUDENT YOU NEED A DIRECTOR OF SOME SORT OVER OVER THE. OKAY COULD I I WOULD JUST ADD I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION ALSO TO HAVE AS PART OF THE FUNDING FORMULA CONVERSATION IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF CATEGORICAL SPENT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. WE THINK IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU CREATE THE RIGHTS RIGHT INCENTIVES AROUND HOW TO SERVE THIS POPULATION OF STUDENTS ANOTHER POPULATION OF STUDENTS THAT WE THINK. YOU KNOW. REQUIRE NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. ABOUT. YET SOME. I'M WEARING TWO HATS ON THIS ONE BECAUSE I'M ALSO THE VICE CHAIR OF THE VETERANS CAN. SO JUST IN A NUTSHELL LIKE THE ELEVATOR SPEECH. MANY OF THE VETERANS. WENT INTO THE MILITARY RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. SO THEIR LIFELINE LITERALLY THEIR LIFELINE IS THAT WHEN THEY GET OUT THERE FOUR YEARS MINIMUM BEHIND EVERYBODY ELSE OKAY PEOPLE ARE GRADUATING FROM BERKELEY. WHILE A LOT OF THESE KIDS ARE STARTIN TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO THERE FOUR YEARS BEHIND RIGHT OUT THE GATE. AND THEY NEED TO GET A JOB. AND THEY NEED TO GET IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THAT'S THE MAIN THING. WE HAVE A VETERAN SUICIDE RATE OF TWENTY TWO. PER DAY IN THE UNITED STATES DON'T KNOW REALLY WHAT IT IS IN CALIFORNIA. DON'T HAVE THAT. BUT ONCE YOU GET THE VETERANS ON TRACK. THEY ACTUALLY AND YOU YOU WOULD HAVE THE NUMBERS MORE THAN I WOULD. THEY TEND TO STICK WITH. MANY OF THEM ARE MARRIED AND THEIR SPOUSES SENATE IN THE SCHOOL AND WORK THEY'RE NOT. GOOF OFF SO THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AND. THE FLAT RATES I THINK ARE VERY EFFECTIVE I'VE BEEN TO MANY OF THE VETERANS CENTERS THEY'RE NOT JUST TO ASSIST VETERANS IN THEIR SCHOOLING. OF MANY OF THEM HAVE PTSD MANY OF. ARE CAUGHT IN A TRAP LIKE LITTLE RATS IN THE VA SYSTEM. AND THEY GET TOGETHER AND COMPARE NOTES AND THEY GET EDUCATED IN ALL HOW TO ACCESS ALL THEIR BENEFITS. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN INSTEAD OF BEING TRAPPED LIKE A RAT. THEY'RE WORKING TOGETHER AND ACTUALLY GETTING SOME OF THEIR BENEFITS AND GETTING SOME OF THEIR APPEALS TAKING CARE OF. SO THESE VETERAN SENATORS ARE OFTEN FOR PEOPLE OF A LIFE RING IT'S A LIFE RAFT FOR. AND I THINK. JUST MY OPINION OBSERVATION I THINK THE TRACK WERE ON IS VERY GOOD. IF WE STAY AT THE FLAT RATES THAT WAY. EACH COLLEGE EACH COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAN A. TAILOR THEIR PROGRAM. TO THE VETERAN COMMUNITY BECAUSE IN SAN DIEGO YOU HAVE NAVY MARINES QUE THAT'S ONE CULTURE A SUBCULTURE. OTHER AREAS WE HAVE AIRFORCE WE HAVE ARMY WE HAVE NATIONAL GUARD EXCEPT SO EACH VETERAN CULTURE. CAN BE DIFFERENT IN THAT AREA AND ALSO THEY CHANGE EVEN IF IT'S SO. MARINE NAVY CULTURE THEY MIGHT BE DIFFERENT IN THE DIFFERENT AREAS. THAT'S JUST THE NATURE OF HUMAN BEINGS SO. I COMMEND YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING. MORE FEEL MORE IS ALWAYS BETTER RIGHT BUT. NEXT YEAR. I'M I'M KEENLY GOING TO LISTEN ASSUMING ON HERE. I AM KEENLY GOING TO LISTEN TO WHAT YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE IF WE NEED TO EXPAND IT. OR IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH THE FUNDING WE HAVE BECAUSE THESE VETERANS CENTERS. THEY'RE FRUGAL THEY DO A LOT WITH VERY LITTLE THAT I GIVE YOUR HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT MISTER VOEPEL. AGAIN HOW ABOUT I GIVE YOU HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT. YOU HEARD WITH THAT SO I THINK WE'RE OPEN TO POTENTIALLY. LOOKING AT THIS IN THE MAY REVISE AND MAYBE AUGMENTED SO MAYBE IF YOU CAN. HELP US COME UP WITH WHAT'S NEEDED IS IT MORE STAFFING IS ARE THE FACILITIES AND WHERE THE SPECIFIC NEEDS ARE SO I JUST. YEAH THROWING MONEY TO THROW MONEY AROUND. I'D BE GLAD TO AND AS YOU KNOW I'M A FISCAL CONSERVATIVE IN EVERY PENNY HAS TO COUNT THANK YOU YES SIR OKAY. SO WITH THAT WE WILL. HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AS WELL. AND. THANK YOU ALL FOR THE PARTICIPATION TODAY. THANK YOU. MILITARY SOURCE. FOR PAGE
