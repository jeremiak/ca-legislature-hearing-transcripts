01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.622
THIS BILL RE FLAX. OF THE

01:03:46.689 --> 01:03:48.891
ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE BILL BUT

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:52.228
ALSO TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:53.029
THE COMMENTS AND CONCERNS OF

01:03:53.095 --> 01:03:55.064
THE OPPOSITION. MY STAFF AND I

01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:56.999
HAVE WORKED MANY HOURS MANY

01:03:57.066 --> 01:03:59.402
DAYS AND REALLY HAVE REALLY

01:03:59.468 --> 01:04:01.904
COME TO A NICE AGREEMENT THIS

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:04.073
BILL DOES TWO CRITICAL THINGS

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:06.075
FIRST AND ALLOW THE SMALL SMALL

01:04:06.142 --> 01:04:07.376
NONPROFIT PERFORMING ARTS

01:04:07.443 --> 01:04:08.945
ORGANIZATIONS TO INTER INTER

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:11.447
GRANT PROGRAMS. AS WE KNOW THE

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:13.549

ABLE TO OPEN LAST YEAR AND

01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:20.323
REALLY RELY ON FUND RAISING

01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:22.058
EFFORTS AND SO THIS BILL REALLY

01:04:22.124 --> 01:04:24.493
IS A LIFELINE TO HELP THEM STAY

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.262
OPEN AND HELP THEM TAKE CARE OF

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:28.130
THEIR EMPLOYEES. UNDER THIS

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:31.100
PROGRAM THIS BILL FOCUSES ON

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:32.902
THE SMALLEST MOST VULNERABLE IN

01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:36.038
OUR COMMUNITIES AND IT DOES

01:04:36.105 --> 01:04:38.808
REALLY GIVE THEM. SOME HOPE SO

01:04:38.874 --> 01:04:39.308
THEY CAN CONTINUE AND BE

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:41.644
SUCCESSFUL. ONCE IT'S

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:42.578

AND IT WILL ALSO BE COST

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:51.420
NEUTRAL AS THEY ENTER INTO THIS

01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:53.155
MASTER PROGRAM. BY CREATING

01:04:53.222 --> 01:04:54.724
ECONOMIES OF SCALE

01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:55.424

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.060
CUT DOWN ON THEIR

01:04:58.127 --> 01:05:00.129
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS BY USING

01:05:00.196 --> 01:05:02.398
THE SAME PROGRAM. HOLLY'S I

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:03.766
ALSO WANT TO SHARE THAT THIS IS

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:07.536
A LITTLE BIT PERSONAL. TO ME. I

01:05:07.603 --> 01:05:09.505
GREW UP IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:13.542
AT A TIME. WHERE DRUGS VIOLENCE

01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:14.176
EVERYTHING YOU DON'T WANT YOUR

01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:15.678
LITTLE GIRL NEXT TO WAS VERY

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:18.180
PREVALENT. AND I WAS A VERY

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:20.616
CREATIVE CHILD VERY EXPRESSIVE

01:05:20.683 --> 01:05:22.351
AND I WAS ABLE TO PUT THAT

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:25.721
ENERGY INTO. POSITIVE WAYS AND

01:05:25.788 --> 01:05:28.958
I FOUND THE ART. AND SO LUCKILY

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:30.893
BECAUSE I HAVE THAT OUTLET I

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.695
WAS ABLE TO DO POSITIVE THINGS

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:36.565
WITH MY LIFE. BUT I ALSO KNOW.

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:37.767
THAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE

01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:39.702
REALLY NOT ONLY HELPFUL TO

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.604
THEMSELVES BUT ALSO TO THE

01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:44.307
SURROUNDING BUSINESSES AND

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:47.877
COMMUNITIES- I STARTED ABOUT

01:05:47.943 --> 01:05:49.545
TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN FASSEL

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:51.814
SAID ONO. AND THE HEART OF

01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:54.050
BOYLE HEIGHTS CAME BACK IN A

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:55.918
COMMUNITY THAT WASN'T DESIRABLE

01:05:55.985 --> 01:05:58.854
AT THE TIME. AGAIN IT WAS A LOT

01:05:58.921 --> 01:06:00.656
OF GANGS AND DRUGS AT THE TIME

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:04.026
BUT I SAW THE LABOR OF LOVE. OF

01:06:04.093 --> 01:06:06.929
THESE ORGANIZATIONS NOT JUST IN

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:08.097
BOYLE HEIGHTS BUT ACROSS OUR

01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:13.002
STATE AND THERE IS ABOUT. TWO

01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.636
THOUSAND THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:15.438
THIS PROGRAM. I'M AND I ALSO

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:17.406
WANTED TO SHARE THAT WHEN I WAS.

01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:19.642
THEIR ACOSTA TWENTY YEARS AGO

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:22.211
IT WAS INCREDIBLE TO SEE HOW.

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:24.213
HOLE FIFTEEN A LOPEZ WHO OPENED

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.448
THIS LITTLE THEATER EMBRACED

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:26.949
ALL THOSE ARTISTS THAT DIDN'T

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:29.085
HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE LITERACY TO

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:30.286
TOOK ALL THOSE KIDS THAT DIDN'T

01:06:30.353 --> 01:06:32.221
HAVE A PLACE TO GO. I REALLY

01:06:32.288 --> 01:06:34.824
OFFERED A SAFE PLACE FOR THEM

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:37.159
TO COME AND LEARN. REALLY IT

01:06:37.226 --> 01:06:38.394
ALSO GAVE A VOICE AND A

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:40.496
PLATFORM TO ALL THOSE ARTISTS

01:06:40.563 --> 01:06:42.665
THAT DIDN'T HAVE EXPERIENCE.

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:45.601
THEY WANTED TO GO FURTHER. BUT

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:47.803
I ALSO KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:50.406
JUST ABOUT MONEY. IT REALLY IS

01:06:50.473 --> 01:06:52.575
ABOUT EQUITY IN ACCESS TO THOSE

01:06:52.641 --> 01:06:54.643
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AS

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:58.147
WELL AS SOCIAL JUSTICE I KNOW.

01:06:58.214 --> 01:06:59.682
ADDITIONALLY THE PERFORMING

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:01.550
ARTS HAVE BEEN A POWERFUL TOOL

01:07:01.617 --> 01:07:03.619
FOR THOSE VOICELESS AND

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:05.488
HISTORICALLY MAJOR SOCIAL

01:07:05.554 --> 01:07:06.055
MOVEMENTS IN OUR NATION'S

01:07:06.122 --> 01:07:08.257
HISTORY HAVE. RELIED ON

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:10.793
PERFORMING ARTS TO ELEVATE THE

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.162
COSTS AND TELL THEIR STORIES WE

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:13.896
CAN GO BACK TO THE WOMAN

01:07:13.963 --> 01:07:15.464
SUFFRAGE WHEN THEY WERE

01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:17.500
ENGAGING WEALTHY AFFLUENT

01:07:17.566 --> 01:07:19.802
FAMILIES TO JOIN THEIR CALLS

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:22.037
AND HELP THEIR MOVEMENT TO

01:07:22.104 --> 01:07:23.606
BRING EQUAL RIGHTS TO WOMEN.

01:07:23.672 --> 01:07:24.774
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WAS

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.442
ALSO KNOWN AS AN ERA OF

01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:28.944
CREATIVE ACTIVISM. THEY USED

01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:30.579
EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER THEY

01:07:30.646 --> 01:07:32.782
USE THEATER STRONG IMAGERY

01:07:32.848 --> 01:07:35.317
POETRY SPOKEN WORD. BECAUSE

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:37.253
THEY WANTED TO CONVEY THEIR

01:07:37.319 --> 01:07:39.221
STORY AND WHAT THEY NEED IT. IN

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:41.424
RETURN AT THE OPERA COMPASS

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:44.226
EMAIL. IS A SMALL NONPROFIT

01:07:44.293 --> 01:07:46.429
THAT STARTED IN THE FIELD AND

01:07:46.495 --> 01:07:49.064
HELPED ORGANIZE THE FARMWORKERS

01:07:49.131 --> 01:07:50.866
TO GET BETTER PAY AND BETTER

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:53.936
WORKING CONDITIONS. AND DURING

THIS PANDEMIC A LOT OF THE

01:07:55.271 --> 01:07:56.739

ARE NOW THREATENED TO CLOSE

01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:00.543
WERE USED BY COMMUNITIES TO

EDUCATE. FOR EXAMPLE PROCESS

01:08:02.978 --> 01:08:04.447

NINETEEN. SO TO ME IT IS

01:08:14.256 --> 01:08:16.125
UNDENIABLE. THAT PERFORMING

01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:17.660
ARTS GO HAND IN HAND WITH

01:08:17.726 --> 01:08:19.462

01:08:19.528 --> 01:08:21.497
CRITICAL ROLE IN OUR SOCIETY.

HEART OF IT IT WAS A COMEDY

01:13:00.509 --> 01:13:02.377
REALLY ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE-

01:13:02.444 --> 01:13:04.012

DEVELOP TO THE SHOW IN SMALL

01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:18.494
THEATERS THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES.

01:13:28.303 --> 01:13:29.571
AS A YOUNG ARTIST WHERE I

01:13:29.638 --> 01:13:31.306
STARTED WERE IT WAS IN THE

01:13:31.373 --> 01:13:33.876
SMALL THEATERS. AND NOT

01:13:33.942 --> 01:13:35.677
EVERYONE GETS ACCESS TO THE

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:37.679
RESOURCES I WAS ABLE TO HAVE.

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.081
AND MOST ARTISTS WHEN THEY'RE

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:40.449
NOT WORKING COUPLE EVERYTHING

01:13:40.516 --> 01:13:42.651
THEY HAVE SO THEY CAN GO BACK

01:13:42.718 --> 01:13:44.453
TO THE THEATER TO WORK. ON

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.188
THEIR CRAFT BECAUSE THESE

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.090
THEATERS ARE INCUBATORS FOR

01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:50.292
IDEAS AND THEY GROW ARTISTS SO

01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:52.895

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:54.663
WHAT THEIR VOICES AND HOW TO

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:56.365
HAVE A VOICE IN THE LARGER

01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:59.468
INDUSTRY. THEATER COMPANIES.

AND THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS

01:14:04.306 --> 01:14:06.341
VITAL BUT WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT

01:14:06.408 --> 01:14:08.343
TO ME IN MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT

01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:10.012
THEY ARE BUILDING COMMUNITY.

01:14:10.078 --> 01:14:11.547

01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:17.653

01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:19.288
THAT THEN PERMEATE TO THE REST

01:14:19.354 --> 01:14:21.423
