01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:42.031
SEE GENOCIDE AS LEGITIMATE.

01:01:42.098 --> 01:01:43.232
INDEED THERE IS NO BETTER

01:01:43.299 --> 01:01:44.834
EXAMPLE THAN THE WORDS OF ADOLF

01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:46.702
HITLER WHO IN THE YEARS PRIOR TO

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:48.871

THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE MUST

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.248
SPEAK OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE.

01:01:59.315 --> 01:02:00.983
WE MUST REMEMBER HISTORY AS IT

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:03.086
ACTUALLY HAPPENED AND CONDEMN

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:05.388
HATE IN ALL OF ITS FORMS.

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:06.522
IN RECENT WEEKS THE ARMENIAN

01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:07.757
COMMUNITY AND MY DISTRICT IN THE

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:09.292
WEST SAN FERNANDO VALLEY HAS

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:10.793
BEEN TARGETED BY HATE.

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:11.928
THIS IS NOT ONLY A MATTER OF

01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:15.031
HISTORY. TO ARMENIAN SCHOOLS IN

01:02:15.098 --> 01:02:16.099
THE WEST SAN FERNANDO VALLEY

01:02:16.165 --> 01:02:17.400
WERE VANDALIZED WITH TURKISH

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:18.534
FLAGS.

01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:19.969
THE EQUIVALENT OF HANGING ****

01:02:20.036 --> 01:02:22.138
FLAGS AT A SYNAGOGUE FOR A

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:23.372
JEWISH SCHOOL.

01:02:23.439 --> 01:02:24.707
INCIDENTS LIKE THESE REMIND US

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:25.741
THAT WE MUST REMAIN CONSTANTLY

01:02:25.808 --> 01:02:27.410
VIGILANT.

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:28.845
ONLY BY BEING HONEST ABOUT THE

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:30.446
HORRORS OF THE PAST CAN WE HOPE

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:31.681
TO PREVENT FUTURE ACTS OF

01:02:31.747 --> 01:02:32.648
GENOCIDE.

01:02:32.715 --> 01:02:34.183
IN THAT SPIRIT AND ON BEHALF OF

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:35.885
THE JEWISH CAUCUS I RESPECTFULLY

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:39.689

01:02:49.765 --> 01:02:51.033
THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:53.503
CAUCUS.

01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:54.637
WE APPLAUD THE EFFORTS OF THE

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:56.272
ARMENIANS FOR THEIR PURSUIT OF

01:02:56.339 --> 01:02:58.040
TRUTH AND JUSTICE FOR THE

01:02:58.107 --> 01:02:59.408
ARMENIAN DURING THEIR MEDIANS A

01:02:59.475 --> 01:03:00.810
GENOCIDE.

01:03:00.877 --> 01:03:02.311
AND THE EXPERIENCE OF ARMENIANS

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:04.013
UNDER THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE IS NOT

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.748
MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE

01:03:05.815 --> 01:03:07.884
EXPERIENCE OF AFRICAN SLAVES OR

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:09.986
NATIVE AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:11.354
IT IS REALLY QUITE INTERESTING

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.089
THAT WE ARE HERE TALKING ABOUT

01:03:13.156 --> 01:03:15.057
THIS THE GENOCIDE.

01:03:15.124 --> 01:03:16.559
AND ONCE AGAIN COMMITTING

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:17.960
OURSELVES TO NEVER LETTING THIS

01:03:18.027 --> 01:03:20.029
HAPPEN AGAIN.

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:21.264
WE KNOW SO MANY WHO HAVE

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:23.766
SUFFERED THIS FORM OF GENOCIDE.

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:25.401
THIS ATTACK ON A INDIVIDUALS

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:26.969
THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR CULTURE

01:03:27.036 --> 01:03:28.104
IN THIS NATION.

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:29.038
THE OTHER DAY I WAS READING AN

01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:31.407
ARTICLE IN THE UNION TRIBUNE AS

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:32.241
WE WERE CELEBRATING.

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:33.809
A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OR FOUR

01:03:33.876 --> 01:03:35.578
HUNDRED YEARS I GUESS IT IS FOR

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:36.812
THE ECONOMY AYE INDIANS AND

01:03:36.879 --> 01:03:39.248
THEIR CONTACT WITH AMERICANS --

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:40.416
WHO CAME HERE AND IT WAS

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:42.218
INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY TALKED

01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:44.320
ABOUT THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT THE

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:45.154
THOUGHT WAS THAT THEY WOULD JUST

01:03:45.221 --> 01:03:47.790
SIMPLY X. -- EXTERMINATE THE

01:03:47.857 --> 01:03:49.258
COMEY AYE INDIANS.

01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:50.326
AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DO

01:03:50.393 --> 01:03:51.594
THAT BUT THEY HAD BASICALLY

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:52.962
REDUCE THEIR NUMBERS DOWN TO

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:54.297
VERY SMALL NUMBERS.

01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:55.765
AND PUT THEM INTO PLACES THAT WE

01:03:55.831 --> 01:03:57.433
NOW CALL RESERVATIONS IN AREAS

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.568
THAT ARE ALMOST DESOLATE WITH

01:03:58.634 --> 01:04:00.269
REGARDS THE ABILITY TO GROW

01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:01.037
CROPS.

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:02.338
AND THE THOUGHT WAS A WILL JUST

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:03.706
EXTERMINATE THEM AND WE'LL JUST

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:04.707
MOVE ON BECAUSE THEY WERE

01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:06.576
OBVIOUSLY NOT USEFUL TO THEM

01:04:06.642 --> 01:04:07.944
ANYMORE ONCE THEY HAD NURTURED

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:09.345
THEM BACK TO HEALTH.

01:04:09.412 --> 01:04:10.546
BECAUSE THOSE WHO WAS THE

01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:11.814
SPANIARD TO CAME HERE WERE ILL

01:04:11.881 --> 01:04:12.715
WHEN THEY ARRIVED IN THIS

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:14.116
COUNTRY IN THIS COUNTRY AND SO

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:15.551
THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:16.185
EXTERMINATE THE INDIANS A CALL

01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:17.620
ME I BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:19.021
MUCH MORE POWERFUL IN THEM THE

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:21.123
COSTUME TO SURVIVE AND TO LIVE.

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:22.825
WE KNOW OF THE MILLIONS WHO DIED

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:23.893
IN THE MIDDLE PASSAGE COMING

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:26.128
FROM AFRICA TO THE UNITED STATES.

01:04:26.195 --> 01:04:27.897
THAT OFTENTIMES OVER 50% OF THE

01:04:27.964 --> 01:04:29.999
CARGO WAS THROWN OVERBOARD OF

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:31.167
PEOPLE COMMITTED SORT OUT

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:33.069
SUICIDE IT DIDN'T SURVIVE THE

01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:34.637
MIDDLE PASSAGE TO COME HERE.

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:36.038
AND AFTER THAT STILL THE KIND OF

01:04:36.105 --> 01:04:37.707
DEGRADATION THAT OCCUR TO TAKE

01:04:37.773 --> 01:04:38.874
AWAY THEIR IDENTITY THE TAKE

01:04:38.941 --> 01:04:40.643
AWAY THE SENSE OF PURPOSE AND

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:42.411
FOCUS AND SO WE'VE SEEN THIS

01:04:42.478 --> 01:04:44.213
COUNTRY BASICALLY PARTICIPATE IN

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.314
THIS WHOLE ISSUE.

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:47.683
OF GENOCIDE IN VARIOUS WAYS AND

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:49.018
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS

01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:50.152
AROUND THE WORLD WE HAVE TO

01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:51.387
RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:53.155
DEVASTATING EXPERIENCE.

01:04:53.222 --> 01:04:54.457
A LASTING EXPERIENCE THAT NOT

01:04:54.523 --> 01:04:56.325
ONLY OF IMPACTS THE FOLKS AT

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:57.860
THAT MOMENT BUT FOR GENERATIONS

01:04:57.927 --> 01:04:59.629
AND GENERATIONS TO COME.

01:04:59.695 --> 01:05:01.264
IT IS SO IMPERATIVE THAT WE TALK

01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:02.531
ABOUT OUR HISTORY IT IS STRONG

01:05:02.598 --> 01:05:04.400
THIS FORM SO THE WE TALK ABOUT

01:05:04.467 --> 01:05:05.701
THE COURAGE OF THOSE WHO

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:07.570
SURVIVED WHO WERE DETERMINED TO

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:09.705
MAINTAIN THEIR SENSE OF HUMANITY.

01:05:09.772 --> 01:05:11.073
AND NOT BE VICIOUS IN THE

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.042
PROCESS BUT ALSO TO MAINTAIN

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:14.744
THEIR CULTURE AND TO ACTUALLY

01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:16.012
GROW AND DEVELOP FROM WHAT

01:05:16.078 --> 01:05:17.013
THEY'VE EXPERIENCED.

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:18.914
IT IS -- INTERESTING AS WE STAND

01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:20.416
HERE TODAY THAT WE ARE STILL

01:05:20.483 --> 01:05:21.917
TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE.

01:05:21.984 --> 01:05:23.352
AND WE ARE FACED WITH SO MANY

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:24.920
HATE CRIMES AND SO MANY THINGS

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:30.393
THAT ARE HAPPENING THAT WE HAVE

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:31.761
A TENDENCY TO IGNORE THE TAPPED

01:05:31.827 --> 01:05:32.395
ON INDIVIDUALS.

01:05:32.461 --> 01:05:32.962
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IN MY

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:34.463
FAMILY THE BURNING OF THE OF THE

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:35.064
CHURCH IN IN PARIS AND SOMEONE

01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:36.265
SAID TO ME BUT WHAT ABOUT THE

01:05:36.332 --> 01:05:37.266
THREE BLACK CHURCHES THAT WERE

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:38.434
BURNED IN THE UNITED STATES

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:40.069
DOING ONE WEEKEND.

01:05:40.136 --> 01:05:40.970
I MEAN THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:42.972
HAVE TO CONFRONT THAT ARE HERE

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:44.573
WITH US AT THIS MOMENT.

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.042
AND IF WE DON'T THEN WE ARE NO

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:47.043
BETTER THAN THOSE WHO

01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:48.844
PARTICIPATED IN THE IN THE

01:05:48.911 --> 01:05:50.846
GENOCIDE THEMSELVES BECAUSE WERE

01:05:50.913 --> 01:05:52.181
TURNING OUT I AWAY FROM THE

01:05:52.248 --> 01:05:53.716
SMALL THINGS BUT THEY'RE REALLY

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:55.451
VERY LARGE THINGS AND VERY

01:05:55.518 --> 01:05:56.852
SYMPTOMATIC OF A NATION.

01:05:56.919 --> 01:05:58.354
THAT REFUSES TO DEAL WITH ITS

01:05:58.421 --> 01:05:59.355
HISTORY.

01:05:59.422 --> 01:06:01.290
AND ITS PRESENT AND THEREFORE

01:06:01.357 --> 01:06:03.125
OBVIOUSLY WILL HAVE CONTINUED TO

01:06:03.192 --> 01:06:04.727
DAMAGE THE FUTURE.

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:05.928
I'VE SAID ON THIS FOR MANY MANY

01:06:05.995 --> 01:06:07.396
TIMES AND WE HAVE TO BE VIGILANT

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:09.432
WE MUST CONTINUE TO WATCH ALL OF

01:06:09.498 --> 01:06:10.533
THOSE THINGS THAT HAVE A

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:12.234
TENDENCY TO DESTROY US.

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:13.669
AND OUR HUMANITY AND OUR SENSE

01:06:13.736 --> 01:06:15.304
OF DEMOCRACY IN FAIRNESS AND

01:06:15.371 --> 01:06:18.174
pTHAT HATRED AND INCLUSION IN

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.375
THIS NATION IS LIKE A RARE

01:06:19.442 --> 01:06:21.577
FLOWER THAT HAS TO BE CONSTANTLY

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:23.079
REMEMBERED AND NURTURED AND

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:25.614
CARED.

01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:27.216
FOR BUT HATRED IS A WEEK.

01:06:27.283 --> 01:06:28.217
DISCRIMINATION IS A WEEK AND A

01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:30.286
GROWS BEST IN THE COLLECT AND WE

01:06:30.353 --> 01:06:31.354
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL THAT WE'RE

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:33.823
NOT NEGLECTING WHAT WE SEE THAT

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:35.758
WE ROOTED OUT AND WE CONTINUE TO

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:37.593
GROW THAT WHICH IS WONDERFUL.

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:38.461
I THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR

01:06:38.527 --> 01:06:40.262

IS IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO

01:07:02.385 --> 01:07:04.687
RECOGNIZE.

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:06.288
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:07.723
THAT WE CONTINUE TO CALL IT WHAT

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:09.825
IT IS?

01:07:09.892 --> 01:07:12.228
THAT WE CALL THIS THE GENOCIDE.

01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:24.373
LITTLE BIT THIS MORNING IS.

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:39.021
CHURCH AND GETTING THE NEWS OF

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:41.424
WHAT HAPPENED IN SRI LANKA.

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:43.359
WHERE THREE HUNDRED OVER THREE

01:07:43.426 --> 01:07:45.261
HUNDRED OTHER CHRISTIANS WERE?

01:07:45.327 --> 01:07:47.930
MURDERED AS THEY WORST.

01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:49.265
PRACTICING THEIR FAITH JUST LIKE.

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:51.434
ME AND MY FAMILY WERE.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.002
THAT MORNING AS WE LOOK AT

01:07:53.068 --> 01:07:54.703
WHAT'S HAPPENED IN CHARLESTON

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:55.004
[inaudible]

01:07:55.070 --> 01:07:56.505
IN PITTSBURGH.

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:59.341
IN NEW ZEALAND.

01:07:59.408 --> 01:07:59.942
AND ALL THESE THINGS THAT ARE

01:08:00.009 --> 01:08:01.110
HAPPENING IN.

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:02.144
RIGHT HERE IN THE PRESENT

01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:02.445
[inaudible]

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:03.779
AGE.

01:08:03.846 --> 01:08:06.382
IN OUR PRESENT ERA.

01:08:06.449 --> 01:08:08.150
WHERE ARE FOR WHATEVER REASON

01:08:08.217 --> 01:08:08.751
PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN TO A POINT

01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:09.919
WHERE THIS?

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:11.587
THE WORDS EVEN THE WORDS THAT

01:08:11.654 --> 01:08:13.889
PEOPLE ARE USING TO DE HUMANIZE

01:08:13.956 --> 01:08:15.157
WHERE YOU CAN DE HUMANIZE

01:08:15.224 --> 01:08:17.860
SOMEONE AS THE ENEMY.

01:08:17.927 --> 01:08:20.062
WE START TO EVEN TALK ABOUT

01:08:20.129 --> 01:08:21.330
OURSELVES EVEN AS AMERICANS

01:08:21.397 --> 01:08:22.698
TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE AS

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:25.367
AN ENEMY.

01:08:25.434 --> 01:08:26.769
RATHER THAN SOMEONE THAT MAY WE

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:29.038
JUST HAVE A DISAGREEMENT WITH.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.406
AND SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:31.841
WE REALLY NEED THIS TO START

01:08:31.907 --> 01:08:33.275
THINKING ABOUT AS AS LEADERS IN

01:08:33.342 --> 01:08:36.779
OUR COMMUNITY -- AS PEOPLE WHO

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:38.481
ARE TRYING TO CREATE A BETTER

01:08:38.547 --> 01:08:40.783
WORLD FOR OUR CHILDREN -- IS

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.885
THAT.

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:43.953
YEAH WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:45.588
HOW WE START TALKING ABOUT EACH

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:47.323
OTHER AND HOW.

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:51.527
WE START BUILDING UP EACH OTHER --

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:53.028
AND THAT WE DON'T WE STOP THIS

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:53.929
YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT'S REALLY

01:08:53.996 --> 01:08:56.131
EASY TO GO DOWN A PATH.

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:57.166
AND WE SEEN IT THROUGHOUT

01:08:57.233 --> 01:08:58.434
HISTORY IS REALLY EASY TO GO

01:08:58.501 --> 01:08:59.969
DOWN A PATH WHERE YOU BEGIN TO

01:09:00.035 --> 01:09:03.472
DE HUMANIZE A GROUP.

01:09:03.539 --> 01:09:04.507
AND IT GETS TO A POINT WHERE

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:05.574
WE'VE WHERE YOU'VE SEEN THE

01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:09.512
ATROCITIES THAT HAVE OCCURRED.

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:11.847
AND WE NEED TO CALL OUT EVIL

01:09:11.914 --> 01:09:13.616
WHEREVER IT EXISTS.

01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:15.184
WHEN WE SEE THAT EVIL WHEN WE

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:16.752
SEE THE STARTING IS IN THE IN

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:18.621
THE CALLS?

01:09:18.687 --> 01:09:20.322
IT'S IT'S NOT ALL THAT SUBTLE.

01:09:20.389 --> 01:09:22.258
WE HAVE PEOPLE OUT THERE CALLING

01:09:22.324 --> 01:09:24.460
FOR THE DEATHS OF CERTAIN GROUPS.

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:25.928
THIS CANNOT BE ALLOWED WE CAN'T

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:27.696
HAVE THIS KIND OF DIALOGUE WE

01:09:27.763 --> 01:09:29.164
CAN ALLOW OUR DIALOGUE TO

01:09:29.231 --> 01:09:31.166
CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH.

01:09:31.233 --> 01:09:32.268
AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:33.536
SO IMPORTANT TODAY THAT WE THAT

01:09:33.602 --> 01:09:35.037
WE REMEMBER.

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:36.238
THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE WHAT LED

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:37.907
UP TO IT.

01:09:37.973 --> 01:09:40.309
HOW IT GOT TO THAT POINT?

01:09:40.376 --> 01:09:42.545
HOW EVEN TODAY?

01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:44.947
THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT DENIES.

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:47.349
WHAT IT IS DONE?

01:09:47.416 --> 01:09:48.517
AND HOW IT NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT

01:09:48.584 --> 01:09:50.252
IN THE LIGHT JUST LIKE SO MANY

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:50.886
OTHER THINGS NEED TO BE BROUGHT

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:53.155
TO LIGHT.

01:09:53.222 --> 01:09:54.557
AND THEN WE NEED TO LOOK BACK AT

01:09:54.623 --> 01:09:57.259
OURSELVES AND LOOK IN THE MIRROR.

01:09:57.326 --> 01:09:59.228
AND SAY HEY HOW DO WE ENSURE

01:09:59.295 --> 01:10:00.829
THAT WE HAVE A DIALOGUE.

01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:03.132
WE CAN DISAGREE ON THINGS WE CAN

01:10:03.198 --> 01:10:03.699
HAVE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:06.902
DIFFERENT [inaudible]

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:10.673
RELIGIONS -- BUT WE NEED TO ALSO

01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:12.474
AT THE TIME AT THE SAME TIME

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:15.010
LEARN TO LIVE WITH EACH OTHER.

01:10:15.077 --> 01:10:16.245
AND HAVE A RESPECTFUL AND A

01:10:16.312 --> 01:10:18.414
CIVIL DIALOGUE AND I WORRY ABOUT

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:19.582
THAT.

01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:21.717
AS IT CONTINUES TO DENIGRATE.

01:10:21.784 --> 01:10:23.018
NOW IN OUR COUNTRY BUT

01:10:23.085 --> 01:10:23.619
THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE

01:10:23.686 --> 01:10:25.220
WORLD.

01:10:25.287 --> 01:10:27.189
THAT WE TRY TO LIFT THAT BACK UP.

01:10:27.256 --> 01:10:28.223
AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE OUR

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:29.124
NATION HAS BEEN A BEACON OF

01:10:29.191 --> 01:10:30.492
LIGHT.

01:10:30.559 --> 01:10:32.261
AS BEING THAT.

01:10:32.328 --> 01:10:34.263
THAT NATION THAT CAN LIFT UP THE

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:35.998
DIALOGUE THAT CAN LIFT UP. TO

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:37.733
THE HIGHEST IDEALS WE NEED TO

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.134
CONTINUE TO DO THAT.

01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:40.803
AND SO I RISE WITH MY MY

01:10:40.869 --> 01:10:41.870
COLLEAGUES TODAY SUPPORT THIS

01:10:41.937 --> 01:10:44.373

THAT KIND OF HIGHER SPIRIT

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:49.411
[inaudible]

01:10:49.478 --> 01:10:52.615

THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHULA

VISTA WHO NOT ONLY EVERY YEAR

01:12:06.588 --> 01:12:08.390
GIVES AN IMPASSIONED SPEECH.

01:12:08.457 --> 01:12:10.059
BUT ALSO THE REFERENCES THAT SHE

01:12:10.125 --> 01:12:12.728
HAS MADE -- I OFTEN WONDER ABOUT

01:12:12.795 --> 01:12:14.563
THE EXPERIENCE OF ARMENIANS

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:18.667
VERSUS AFRICAN AMERICAN SLAVES --

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:21.370
WHILE BOTH ARE TRAGIC.

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:23.739
I SOMETIMES FEEL.

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:26.241
AS ARMENIANS WE WERE THERE WAS

01:12:26.308 --> 01:12:28.811
AN EFFORT TO ERADICATE.

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:31.680
BUT THOSE OF US WHO SURVIVED

01:12:31.747 --> 01:12:33.415
STILL NO WHERE OUR LANDS ARE.

01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:36.251
STILL NO WHERE WE COME FROM

01:12:36.318 --> 01:12:36.552
[inaudible]

01:12:36.618 --> 01:12:39.021
STILL NO.

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:40.789
AS YOU WILL SEE THERE IS A BOOK

01:12:40.856 --> 01:12:42.558
ON ALL OF YOUR DESKS.

01:12:42.624 --> 01:12:44.493
THERE'S FIGHTS OVER SEND

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.962
SPENDING OVER CENTURIES OF WHAT

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:48.897
PAGES OF WHAT MANUSCRIPTS WERE

01:12:48.964 --> 01:12:49.765
STOLEN.

01:12:49.832 --> 01:12:51.734
AND FOR WHAT.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.836
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT WAS SOLD

01:12:53.902 --> 01:12:55.170
TO WITH THIS MUSEUM WHERE THAT

01:12:55.237 --> 01:12:56.772
MUSEUM AND NOW THEY'RE ALL BEING

01:12:56.839 --> 01:12:57.639
WEEK.

01:12:57.706 --> 01:12:59.608
RECOLLECTED AND BEING PUT INTO

01:12:59.675 --> 01:13:02.911
BACK INTO ONE ONE PLACE.

01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:06.415
SO THERE IS A CON CONTINUATION.

01:13:06.482 --> 01:13:07.750
TO THE HISTORY.

01:13:07.816 --> 01:13:08.784
THROUGH THE FACT THAT WE

01:13:08.851 --> 01:13:11.053
SURVIVED.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.122
AND WE WERE ABLE.

01:13:13.188 --> 01:13:15.758
TO LAKE CLAIM AND CONTINUE TO

01:13:15.824 --> 01:13:17.693
FIGHT AND PURSUE THAT CLAIM.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:18.961
WHEN I TALK TO MY AFRICAN

01:13:19.027 --> 01:13:20.229
AMERICAN FRIENDS AND THIS IS

01:13:20.295 --> 01:13:21.430
GOING BACK TO THE TIME WHEN I

01:13:21.497 --> 01:13:22.898
WAS A TEENAGER?

01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:24.733
AND TRY TAKES ASK WILL DO YOU

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:25.834
KNOW WHERE YOUR FAMILY CAME FROM

01:13:25.901 --> 01:13:27.436
INITIALLY.

01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:30.672
AND TO HAVE THAT FAMILIAR OLD.

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:33.041
BOND NOT BEING ABLE TO BE

01:13:33.108 --> 01:13:34.543
STRETCHED BEYOND JUST YOUR

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:36.345
GRANDPARENTS GENERATION.

01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:37.446
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE NEVER

01:13:37.513 --> 01:13:38.781
FELT.

01:13:38.847 --> 01:13:39.982
I'VE NEVER KNOWN HOW HARD THAT

01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:43.385
IS. TO HAVE A TO HAVE

01:13:43.452 --> 01:13:43.685
[inaudible]

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:45.287
A LINE.

01:13:45.354 --> 01:13:47.156
COMPLETELY BROKEN AND NOT EVEN

01:13:47.222 --> 01:13:49.591
KNOW WHERE YOU'RE FROM.

01:13:49.658 --> 01:13:51.860
AND WHEN WE SWEEP ISSUES LIKE

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:53.729
THIS UNDER THE CARPET.

01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:55.130
WHICH IS HAPPENING BECAUSE OF A

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:56.331
COUPLE OF THINGS COLLEAGUES

01:13:56.398 --> 01:13:58.233
LET'S BE HONEST.

01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:01.036
IS SHE POLITICS ITS OIL.

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:04.907
THAT'S WHAT IT IS. TO THIS DAY.

01:14:04.973 --> 01:14:05.841
THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT

01:14:05.908 --> 01:14:06.141
[inaudible]

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:07.543
WILL [inaudible]

DEMOLISH.

01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:12.014
OR BREAK A PART.

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.551
TAKE DOWN CROSSES.

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:18.220
DESTROY ANY TYPE OF CULTURAL

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:26.595
IT'S YOU CAN SEE IT ON YOU. TO

01:14:26.662 --> 01:14:28.564

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:30.465
THAT DESTRUCTION HAPPENS IN

01:14:30.532 --> 01:14:33.101
ORDER TO REVISE HISTORY TO SAY

01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:34.636
THAT THIS ANGEL PEOPLE ANCIENT

01:14:34.703 --> 01:14:36.338
PEOPLE WHO LIVED THERE FOR FIVE

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:38.073
THOUSAND YEARS.

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:40.275
REALLY WAS NOT THERE IT'S ALL.

01:14:40.342 --> 01:14:42.611
FICTION.

01:14:42.678 --> 01:14:45.013
THIS IS HAPPENING.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:47.449
IN OUR LIFETIMES.

01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:49.284
THIS IS HAPPENING WHILE WE HAVE

01:14:49.351 --> 01:14:50.786
THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE

01:14:50.853 --> 01:14:53.155
CAPABILITY TO SEE WHAT'S WHAT

01:14:53.222 --> 01:14:55.557
AND WHERE EVERYTHING IS.

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:57.392
AND IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW SO

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:59.328
YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE.

01:14:59.394 --> 01:15:00.929
WHAT THE MONTH OF APRIL TO ME

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:02.564
FEELS LIKE BECAUSE IT'S THIS

01:15:02.631 --> 01:15:05.067
TREMENDOUS WEIGHT?

01:15:05.133 --> 01:15:07.936
EVERY TIME MARCH ENDS AND APRIL

01:15:08.003 --> 01:15:10.205
BEGINS.

01:15:10.272 --> 01:15:12.307
AND IRONICALLY APRIL IS SUPPOSED

01:15:12.374 --> 01:15:14.176
TO BE THE MONTH OF REBIRTH.

01:15:14.243 --> 01:15:15.544
IT SUPPORT WE JUST CELEBRATED

01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:18.780
NOR IS LESS THAN A MONTH AGO.

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:19.348
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE TIME

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:20.849
THAT.

01:15:20.916 --> 01:15:22.184
LIFE IS BLOOMING AND

01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:23.919
REGENERATING [inaudible]

01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:26.622
AND YET. TWO WEEKS AGO WE

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:27.890
RECOGNIZE THE CAMBODIAN

01:15:27.956 --> 01:15:28.190
[inaudible]

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:29.925
GENOCIDE.

01:15:29.992 --> 01:15:30.926
NEXT WEEK WE'RE GONNA BE

01:15:30.993 --> 01:15:34.529
RECOGNIZING THE JEWISH HOLOCAUST.

01:15:34.596 --> 01:15:36.965
AT SOME POINT WE WILL BE ALSO.

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:38.800
MAKING SURE EVEN THOUGH IT'S IN

01:15:38.867 --> 01:15:41.436
SPOKEN WORDS IN ALL OF OUR ALL

01:15:41.503 --> 01:15:43.772
OF OUR COMMENTS THE RWANDAN

01:15:43.839 --> 01:15:45.807
GENOCIDE WAS ALSO IN APRIL.

01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:47.509
ALONG WITH THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE.

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:48.377
IT.

01:15:48.443 --> 01:15:50.145
EVERYONE OF THEM HAVE HAPPENED

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:51.880
IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT.

01:15:51.947 --> 01:15:55.651
IN ONE CASE. ONE WAS KILLED ON

01:15:55.717 --> 01:15:58.220
THEIR OWN LAND IN ANOTHER CASE.

01:15:58.287 --> 01:15:59.588
ONE MAD MEN WENT AROUND ALL THE

01:15:59.655 --> 01:16:01.056
OTHER COUNTRIES AND MADE SURE

01:16:01.123 --> 01:16:02.658
ALL THE DIE ASPIRIN COMMUNITIES

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:05.294
WERE KILLED IN ANOTHER.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.095
THE ONLY REGION KILLED ITS OWN

01:16:07.162 --> 01:16:08.664
PEOPLE IN ANOTHER AREA TWO

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:09.698
TRIBES THAT HAVE BEEN LIVING

01:16:09.765 --> 01:16:11.900
TOGETHER FOR CENTURIES.

01:16:11.967 --> 01:16:13.268
WE'RE COMMITTING THE ATROCIOUS

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:15.070
HORRIFIC ACTIVITIES WITH AGAINST

01:16:15.137 --> 01:16:18.173
ONE ANOTHER -- AND UNFORTUNATELY

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.608
HERE ON OUR OWN LAND.

01:16:19.675 --> 01:16:21.610
WE STILL YET.

01:16:21.677 --> 01:16:23.145
TO A DRESS APPROPRIATELY WHAT IS

01:16:23.211 --> 01:16:25.347
HAPPENED. TO THE INDIGENOUS

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:26.915
PEOPLES OF THE UNITED STATES.

01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:28.383
BEFORE THE UNITED STATES OF

01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:30.385
AMERICA WAS ESTABLISHED

01:16:30.452 --> 01:16:30.686
[inaudible]

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:34.456
SO -- I I THINK ALL OF YOU FOR

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:35.490
STANDING.

01:16:35.557 --> 01:16:39.061
UP I I JUST WANT TO MAKE.

01:16:39.127 --> 01:16:41.663
THERE ARE TWO PROFOUND COMMENTS

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:43.398
THE STATEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:16:43.465 --> 01:16:44.733
MADE OVER TIME THAT I THINK

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.769
SPEAK VERY WELL TO THIS ISSUE.

01:16:47.836 --> 01:16:49.204
ONE IS THAT I I CAN'T HELP BUT

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:50.939
TO REMEMBER THE POINT WORDS OF

01:16:51.006 --> 01:16:52.774
DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING WHEN

01:16:52.841 --> 01:16:54.309
YOU SO ACCURATELY STATED IN THE

01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:56.011
END.

01:16:56.078 --> 01:16:57.179
WE WILL REMEMBER NOT THE WORDS

01:16:57.245 --> 01:16:58.780
OF OUR ENEMIES BUT THE SILENCE

01:16:58.847 --> 01:17:01.783
OF OUR FRIENDS.

01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:03.685
AND THAT AN INJUSTICE IN ONE

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:06.521
PLACE IS AN INJUSTICE EVERYWHERE.

01:17:06.588 --> 01:17:08.857
RAISING THE SECOND.

01:17:08.924 --> 01:17:10.559
ONE BUT THE OTHER ONE FROM

01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:11.960
PHILOSOPHER AND WRITER MILAN

01:17:12.027 --> 01:17:13.128
KUNDERA.

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:14.396
THE STRUGGLE OF MAN AGAINST

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:15.998
POWER IS THE STRUGGLE OF MEMORY

01:17:16.064 --> 01:17:18.233
AGAINST FORGETTING.

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:19.701
ALL OF US HERE IN THIS CHAMBERS

01:17:19.768 --> 01:17:23.238
KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED.

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:25.374
BECAUSE OF OUR POSITIONS WE HAVE

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:28.043
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR EXPOSURE.

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:30.312
BUT MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS.

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:33.548
LIVING IN THE FIFTY LARGEST

01:17:33.615 --> 01:17:35.217
ECONOMY OF THE WORLD THAT HAS

01:17:35.283 --> 01:17:37.052
THE BENEFITS AND THE RICHES.

01:17:37.119 --> 01:17:38.120
OF INFORMATION AT THEIR

01:17:38.186 --> 01:17:40.222
FINGERTIPS.

01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:42.324
STILL DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THESE

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:44.126
ISSUES.

01:17:44.192 --> 01:17:45.560
AND THE LONGER THEY GO ON NOT

01:17:45.627 --> 01:17:46.995
KNOWING.

01:17:47.062 --> 01:17:49.831
THAT'S UNFORTUNATELY WHAT ALLOWS.

01:17:49.898 --> 01:17:51.333
HORRIFIC ACTIVITIES TO HAPPEN

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.535
BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HOLD PEOPLE

01:17:53.602 --> 01:17:55.504
ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT THEY DID.

01:17:55.570 --> 01:17:57.005
IF WE DON'T TAKE STEPS TO MAKE

01:17:57.072 --> 01:17:59.941
SURE THAT PEOPLE PAID THE PRICE.

01:18:00.008 --> 01:18:01.043
FOR THE ACTIVITIES THAT THEY

01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:01.910
COMMITTED THE HORRORS THAT THEY

01:18:01.977 --> 01:18:03.478
COMMITTED.

01:18:03.545 --> 01:18:05.247
IN THIS CASE WHEN MY COLLEAGUE

01:18:05.313 --> 01:18:07.649
FROM ENCINO SPOKE ABOUT THE

01:18:07.716 --> 01:18:09.084
FLAGS BEING PUT UP.

01:18:09.151 --> 01:18:12.087
MANY OF US EVEN HERE WOULD SAY.

01:18:12.154 --> 01:18:13.989
WHY DOES A FLAG IGNITE SUCH

01:18:14.056 --> 01:18:15.290
HORRIFIC MEMORIES [inaudible]

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:18.360
COLLEAGUES.

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:20.796
WHEN HITLER TOOK OVER GERMANY HE

01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:22.631
CHANGED THE FLAG?

01:18:22.697 --> 01:18:24.833
AND PUT THE SWASTIKA ON THE FLAG.

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:26.168
WHEN HITLER FELL?

01:18:26.234 --> 01:18:28.770
THE FLAG WENT AWAY.

01:18:28.837 --> 01:18:30.972
SYMBOLIZING THAT THE REGIME.

01:18:31.039 --> 01:18:32.741
IS GONE.

01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:34.109
WE WILL NEVER TRY TO BRING THAT

01:18:34.176 --> 01:18:36.244
BACK AGAIN.

01:18:36.311 --> 01:18:39.381
THE TURKISH REPUBLICS FLAG.

01:18:39.448 --> 01:18:41.516
IS STILL THE SAME.

01:18:41.583 --> 01:18:43.518
FROM PHOTOS YOU CAN EVEN LOOK AT

01:18:43.585 --> 01:18:45.987
WHEN THEY WOULD MASS HANG.

01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:48.256
COMMUNITY LEADERS IN TOWNS AND

01:18:48.323 --> 01:18:49.925
CITIES IN ARMENIA.

01:18:49.991 --> 01:18:52.294
HISTORIC LANDS OF ARMENIA.

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.362
AND YET THE CLAIM THAT THE

01:18:54.429 --> 01:18:55.931
GOVERNMENT HAS CHANGED THE

01:18:55.997 --> 01:18:58.200
SYMBOLS HAVE CHANGED.

01:18:58.266 --> 01:18:59.901
AND THAT THEY ARE REFORMED AND

01:18:59.968 --> 01:19:02.671
THAT WAS IN THE PAST.

01:19:02.737 --> 01:19:05.073
IF WE LET THE PAST CONTINUE TO

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:08.043
NOT BE RESOLVED.

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:11.113
AND TO CONTINUE TO HAUNT --

01:19:11.179 --> 01:19:12.948
IT'LL ONLY IMPACT THIS GOING

01:19:13.014 --> 01:19:14.883
INTO THE FUTURE AND WE WILL

01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:16.485
NEVER BE ABLE TO OVERCOME THE

01:19:16.551 --> 01:19:17.919
CHALLENGES IN FACT.

01:19:17.986 --> 01:19:19.454
THE CHALLENGES WILL BECOME WORSE

01:19:19.521 --> 01:19:21.123
OR AND WERE SIR OVER THE YEARS

01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:24.226

REMEMBERS THE DEVASTATING

02:32:24.502 --> 02:32:26.670
CAMPFIRE FROM NOVEMBER LAST YEAR

02:32:26.737 --> 02:32:28.706
IT WAS THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE AND

02:32:28.772 --> 02:32:30.207
THE DEADLIEST WILDFIRE

02:32:30.274 --> 02:32:31.742
CALIFORNIA STATE HISTORY.

02:32:31.809 --> 02:32:33.911
IT WAS ALSO THE NATION'S MOST

02:32:33.978 --> 02:32:37.548
COSTLY DISASTER IN.

02:32:37.615 --> 02:32:38.215
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ALONG WITH

02:32:38.282 --> 02:32:39.917
MANY OF YOU I TOOK A TOUR OF THE

02:32:39.984 --> 02:32:42.019
DEVASTATED TOWN OF PARADISE IN

02:32:42.086 --> 02:32:42.920
JANUARY.

02:32:42.987 --> 02:32:44.922
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLY EMOTIONAL

02:32:44.989 --> 02:32:47.258
EXPERIENCE FOR ME TO SEE.

02:32:47.324 --> 02:32:48.492
THE DEVASTATION IN THAT

02:32:48.559 --> 02:32:49.994
COMMUNITY WITH WHOLE

02:32:50.060 --> 02:32:52.630
SUBDIVISIONS SUPERMARKETS.

02:32:52.696 --> 02:32:54.565
BURNED TO THE GROUND.

02:32:54.632 --> 02:32:56.200
BUT THE MOST AFFECTING PIECE OF

02:32:56.267 --> 02:32:57.701
TESTIMONY THAT WE HEARD THAT DAY

02:32:57.768 --> 02:32:59.403
WAS FROM THE FIRST RESPONDERS

02:32:59.470 --> 02:33:00.571
WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:33:00.638 --> 02:33:02.706
EVACUATING PEOPLE OUT OF THE

02:33:02.773 --> 02:33:03.474

PARADISE HAS FOR EGRESS ROUTES

02:33:05.910 --> 02:33:07.678
THE END YET THE SPREAD OF THE

02:33:07.745 --> 02:33:09.446
FIRE WAS SO RAPID.

02:33:09.513 --> 02:33:12.016
THAT OVER 50% OF THE STRUCTURES

02:33:12.082 --> 02:33:13.450
THAT BURNED IN THAT FIRE WERE

02:33:13.517 --> 02:33:15.185
IGNITED WITHIN FOUR HOURS TO THE

02:33:15.252 --> 02:33:16.453
IGNITION OF THE FIRE.

02:33:16.520 --> 02:33:17.855
SO THERE WAS NO TIME TO GET

02:33:17.922 --> 02:33:18.422
PEOPLE OUT OF THE TOWN OF

02:33:18.489 --> 02:33:20.257

02:33:22.192 --> 02:33:24.161
ADVANCED SO RAPIDLY.

02:33:24.228 --> 02:33:25.296
THAT PEOPLE ABANDONED THEIR

02:33:25.362 --> 02:33:26.997
VEHICLES AND ALL FOUR OF THOSE

02:33:27.064 --> 02:33:28.265
ROUTES WERE COMPLETELY CLOGGED

02:33:28.332 --> 02:33:30.000
WE HEARD SURVIVORS TALK ABOUT

02:33:30.067 --> 02:33:31.235
SHELTERING IN THE MIDDLE OF

02:33:31.302 --> 02:33:32.403
MEADOWS.

02:33:32.469 --> 02:33:33.571
SHELTERING IN THEIR VEHICLES IN

02:33:33.637 --> 02:33:35.072
THE MIDDLE OF INTERSECTIONS

02:33:35.139 --> 02:33:35.639
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE BIGGEST

02:33:35.706 --> 02:33:37.608
STRETCH OF ON VEGETATED GROUND

02:33:37.675 --> 02:33:38.876

THANKFULLY FOR MOST OF THEM OF

02:33:40.277 --> 02:33:41.278
THAT STRATEGY WORKED.

02:33:41.345 --> 02:33:43.280
BUT WE WILL NOT BE SO LUCKY IN

02:33:43.347 --> 02:33:44.715
