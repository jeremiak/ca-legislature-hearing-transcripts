THERE ARE MANY SERIOUS THREATS WE FACE THAT ARE CONSTRAINED BY NATIONAL BORDERS. AND AFFECT EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS MADE THAT CLEAR. THE CLIMATE CHANGE CRISIS IS NO DIFFERENT. BECAUSE OF CALIFORNIA'S PROXIMITY TO CHINA IT BENEFITS OUR STATE GREATLY IF CHINA IS ABLE TO REDUCE ITS T. X. T. EMISSIONS. CHINA CURRENTLY IN ITS 28% OF THE WORLD'S CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS. MEANWHILE WE HAVE OUR OWN AIR POLLUTION CHALLENGES IN CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION THE LOS ANGELES AREA IS THE SMOGGIEST METRO AREA IN THE COUNTRY. FOR THE TWENTY FIRST TIME IN THE LAST TWENTY TWO YEARS. IN FACT NINE OF THE TEN SMOGGIEST COUNTIES IN THE COUNTRY ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH SAMPOERNA DINO RIVERSIDE AND LOS ANGELES. COUNTIES BEING THE FIRST SECOND AND THIRD WORST IN THE NATION. TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND REDUCE EMISSIONS WE MUST HAVE STRONG PARTNERSHIPS AROUND THE WORLD. IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN FORMER CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR EDMUND G. BROWN JUNIOR HELPED LAUNCH THE CALIFORNIA CHINA CLIMATE INSTITUTE. TO PROMOTE CLIMATE ACTION THROUGH JOINT RESEARCH TRAINING AND DIALOGUE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND CHINA. THE INSTITUTE IS PARTNERING WITH LEADING ACADEMIC AND GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES IN CHINA. AND PROVIDING A PLATFORM TO BUILD THESE VIRTUALLY NEEDED PARTNERSHIPS. THE INSTITUTE ADVANCES JOINT POLICY RESEARCH ON MAJOR CLIMATE ISSUES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED. TO CARBON LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION ZERO EMISSION V. HOLES ALL CARBON PRICE CLIMATE ADEPT AND RESILIENCE SUSTAINABLE LAND USE AND CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE AND LONG TERM CLIMATE GOAL SETTING AND POLICY ENFORCEMENT.

PUTS THE LEGISLATIVE STAMP OF APPROVAL ON OUR INTELLECTUAL AND ACADEMIC EFFORT TOWARD CHRISTIAN LAW UNIVERSITY WITH MINISTRY SHIA THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR.

WE HAVE A PROBLEM- WITH CLIMATE CHANGE WE MUST REDUCE AND ELIMINATE A CARBON EMISSIONS AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ADAPT. AND INTRODUCE- GREAT RESILIENCY INTO OUR FORESTS ARE OUR CITIES OUR WATERS ARE COASTAL AREAS. IT IS QUITE A CHALLENGE AND IT CAN'T BE DONE. WITHOUT COOPERATION WITH CHINA CHINA IS EMITTING A 28% UNITED STATES IS EMITTING A. 13% HISTORICALLY WE THE EMITTED MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE AND PUT MORE SHE TWO IN THE ATMOSPHERE STILL.

THANK YOU CHAIR IS SAID GOVERNOR BROWN STILL ON THE LINE PER QUESTION DO WE KNOW IF GOVERNOR I'M NOT- OKAY VERY GOOD PLEASE PROCEED CENTER GLAZER THANK YOU A GOVERNOR I UNDERSTAND YOUR PROFESSOR- NOW DO YOU PREFER BEING ADDRESSED AS PROFESSOR BROWN OR GOVERNOR BROWN. THAT QUESTION IS IT SELF I LIKE BEING GOVERNOR ALTHOUGH I'M GLAD NOT TO BE THERE NOW OKAY THANK YOU GOVERNOR AYE WE- I APPRECIATE YOUR ABILITY I'M NOT BEING FOR FREIGHT IS A PROFESSOR THEY ONLY GIVE ME PSYCHIC INCOME. THAT IS A WONDERFUL TOUCH DOWN- OF MEMORIES THANK YOU GOVERNOR AND THANK YOU FOR LENDING YOUR POWERFUL VOICE TO THIS ISSUE OF CLIMATE- YOU BEEN RELENTLESS AND- AND CLEAR ABOUT THE THREAT IT FACES AND I'M I'M- HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I. I DID WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION THAT- HAS SOME PEOPLE CONCERNED AND ALLOW YOU TO ADDRESS IT AS IT RELATES TO THIS BILL- THAT THAT CONCERN REVOLVES AROUND HUMAN RIGHTS- IN PARTICULAR OF RECENT NOTE THAT. THE CONCERN ABOUT THE HOW THE UIGHURS ARE BEING TREATED IN IN THE COUNTRY COULD YOU. SPEAK TO THAT IF YOU WISH. YEAH VERY MUCH SO I KNEW THIS IS OF DEEP CONCERN. THAT IS OF CONCERN TO ME IN TO. ANYBODY WHO REALLY KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON- THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS GOING ON IN CHINA. AS THAT I DON'T LIKE. IT ENDED TOO OF ALL THE COLUSA. HIM JUST WHICH WE DON'T LIKE EITHER. BUT THE FACT IS A CLIMATE. IS A PLANETARY CHALLENGES IN EXPONENTIAL CHALLENGE. DURING THE COLD WAR WITH RUSSIA WHEN WE GET SEVERE- DISAGREEMENT. IN THE FEAR OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM- TAKING OVER THE WORLD- AMERICANS STILL ENTERED INTO. A NUCLEAR AGREEMENT TO MAKE THE WORLD SAFE FROM A% NUCLEAR ACCIDENT OR NUCLEAR WAR WE HAVE THE ANY SIMILAR. TO IT IN CLIMATE. CLIMATE IS A THREAT TO PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD. HEY WE CAN'T SOLVE IT WE CAN'T EVEN GET CLOSE TO SOLVING IT WITHOUT CHINESE EFFORT REAL CHINESE EFFORTS. IN REDUCING ELIMINATING THE COAL- REDUCING THE OIL IN THEIR GAS JUST LIKE WE HAVE TO DO THE SAME THING. SO WE'RE FACING HERE A PLANETARY CORRECT. AND WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT IT DEAL WITH IT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE- ATTEMPTING. AT THE- CALIFORNIA CHINA CLIMATE INSTITUTE WE'RE NOT GOING TO WE CAN SOLVE. ALL THE PROBLEMS THE WORLD BUT WE CAN ADVANCE SERIOUS. INTELLECTUAL INQUIRY IN HOW WE DEAL. WITH CARBON EMISSIONS HOW WE ADAPT TO THE RISING TEMPERATURES RISING SEA LEVEL AND THE DISRUPTIVE- WHETHER EVENTUALLY WERE ALL IN JANUARY. SO IT'S A POSITIVE AND- SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT. BUT YOU CAN OPPOSE PEOPLE. CALL PREFER. AND YET ON A CALM THREAT AND A COMMON GOAL. WHICH CLIMATE CHANGE. PRESENTS DOUBLE CHINA AMERICA WE CAN FIND. LIMON A GO. GOING FORWARD AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS. WE TO CAN- WORKING ALL AT A JOINT PROBLEM WE JOINT STRATEGY SO THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING IT DOESN'T MINIMIZE ANY EFFORT TO- PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA OR ANYWHERE ELSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- PROFESSOR I MEAN HE'S BEEN GOVERNOR BROWN PRECIADO- YOUR INSIGHT AND THAT STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS ISSUE HERE AND ACROSS THE- STREET CAMPAIGN CONTROL NO I MEAN SENATOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS THANK YOU GOVERNOR BROWN WE APPRECIATE YOU CALLING IN. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS GREAT I MISS ALL OF YOU. COME BY SOMETIME SELDES GREAT THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ARE COMMON IN THE COMMITTEE. YES SENATOR MCGUIRE YOU SO MUCH VERY GOOD FROM CHAIR INTO AND BRIGITTE THE QUESTION THAT THE GOOD SENATOR FROM RENEE DANCE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WANTED TO BE ABLE TO ALSO ASK- SOONER CHAT IS A MEMBER CHAO SO LOOK. I THINK THAT THE CONCERN IS THAT THAT IS PROBABLY A 100% AGREEMENT AT THESE TWO NATIONS NEED TO WORK CLOSER TOGETHER ON ALL ISSUES OF CLIMATE- NOW THOUGH- BUT WE SEE A FOCUS EVENT COMPLETE EXTERMINATION OF A CULTURE WITHIN THE COUNTRY COUNTRY. OF CHINA WITH UIGHUR MUSLIMS. IT IS OF GREAT CONCERN AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I KNOW OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW IS FOCUSING IN ON ONE OF YOUR TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO DISCUSS HAT BECAUSE- CLIMATE CHANGE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS OF OUR TIME IN IF YOU'RE WE ARE MUSLIM IN THAT COUNTRY. CHINA IS THE GREATEST THREAT TO YOUR FAMILY AT THIS TIME SO IF YOU DON'T MIND COMING ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THERE ARE GROWING CONCERNS PLEASE ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION SENATOR AND I WISH I COULD REPEAT WHAT THE GOVERNOR. SAID EARLIER BUT ESSENTIALLY I AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR I IN THE SENSE THAT- YOU KNOW- EASIER CHINA MAY HELP POLICIES THAT WE DO NOT ALL AGREE WITH AND OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THIS IS HUMAN RIGHTS IS ONE OF THOSE- YEAH. AND I UNDERSTAND THE SENTIMENT AND SAID EXPRESSED BY YOURSELF AND ALSO THE CALLERS. YEAH BUT- I THINK WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO OUR SEPARATE ISSUES LIKE THE GOVERNOR SAID AND IDENTIFY WHO WANTS THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THEM ON AND CLIMATE CHANGE DEFINITELY IS ONE OF THOSE. GUYS AS I STATED EARLIER- AND THE GOVERNOR- CHINA CURRENTLY EMITS LIKE 20% OF THE WORLD'S CARBON DIOXIDE THAT'S KIND OF STUFF THAT WE KIND OF SECONDARY SINGLE DAY. NOW THAT TRANSLATES TO TEN OP BILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE SUIT YOU KNOW AND GIVEN THE PROXIMITY THAT WE ARE WITH CHINA. TO IT BENEFITS GREATLY FOR YOU KNOW FOR US TO WORK WITH DOWN. AND YOU KNOW THE GET THEIR NUMBERS THAT TO. IS MANAGER. SO 2% THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT REALLY NOTHING TO SNEEZE AT. SO YOU KNOW THIS ONE AREA THAT WE CAN WORK IN FACT THAT'S WHAT THE CONFEDERATE IS. TO BY THE GOVERNOR AN EXISTENTIAL. THREAT TO THE CLIMATE DOT AND YOU KNOW THE SPECIFICS THAT YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS I CITED EARLY ALSO INDICATE THAT AS WELL. SO I DO UNDERSTAND THE SENTIMENT. EXPRESSED SIDE SO- BUT I THINK THIS IS ONE AREA THAT WE CAN WORK ON STAR WITH CHINA. THE SIMPSONS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SENATOR PAM. THANK YOU AND I HAVE TO MAY ALSO SHARE THE CONCERNS OF MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS- WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE UIGHURS WE CAN ALSO TALK ABOUT THE DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS IN HONG KONG WHAT'S HAPPENING IN HONG KONG AS WELL- THE BILLING. OF TAIWAN AS WELL. FOR ANY FROM ENTERING THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION- SO THESE ARE CERTAINLY SIGNIFICANT SERMONS- HOWEVER I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU HERE IS THAT- THE INSTITUTE ITSELF- WHICH- IS- WHICH- YOU SEE YOU BUSINESS PARTNERSHIPS. IS THAT. IT THEY JUST WANT TO CLARIFY- I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S NOT FUNDED BY THE STATE. ITSELF RIGHT IT'S IT WOULD BE UC COLLABORATING. WITH THE UNIVERSITY AND- IN CHINA IT DOLLARS IT WITH THE GOVERNMENT. ARE CURRENTLY THE ICE OUT IT'S GOT TO THE GOVERNMENT. I'LL BE GLAD TO COMMENT LIBRARIES THE MONEY WE'VE- THIS ISSUE. PRIVATE MONEY COMING FROM NONPROFIT HEWLETT. HAS CONTRIBUTED IT'S ABOUT A TWO MILLION DOLLAR OPERATION- HEWITT- IS THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR AND WE HAVE WE HAVE OTHERS BLOOMBERG- IN DISCIPLINES NO MONEY. FROM A CHINESE ENTITIES. OKAY FOR THIS TO GO. OKAY TEN AND THIS IS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN YOU SEE AND- THE- THREE MORE UNIVERSITY IN BEIJING THE BIGGEST. MOST IMPORTANT UNIVERSITY IN CHINA ONE OF MOST UNIVERSITIES IN THE WORLD ALL RIGHT SO THE TOTAL BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER I DO SAY SO MYSELF MY PHILOSOPHY IS WHAT I CALL POLITICALLY REALISM THERE ARE CERTAIN- THREATS THE VIRUS- THE DANGER OF NUCLEAR WAR OR MISTAKE OR MISCALCULATION- CYBER ASSAULTS- ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. MILITARIZATION SPACE THAT AFFECTS EVERYBODY ON PLANET EARTH AND WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO CHIP AWAY AT EACH OF THOSE PROBLEMS FOR THE BILL IN GOLFERS THERE HAVE BEEN SERIOUS- SCHOLARS WHO WERE SAYING THAT THE POTENTIALITY OF HUMAN EXTINCTION IS NO REAL- TO BE ORDERED FROM OXFORD ESTIMATES WE HAVE A ONE IN SIX CHANCE. IN THIS CENTURY OF THE UNRECOVERABLE COLLAPSE THE CIVILIZATION ONE OF THE KEY CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS THREAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE THE GOVERNMENTS IN CHINA WILL COME AND GO WE'VE BEEN ENEMIES WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS THE SAME IS TRUE OF OTHER COUNTRIES GERMANY AND JAPAN WE'VE GOT TO WORK ON THIS LONG TERM THREAT THE OVER HERE. LONG AFTER. THE CURRENT CROP OF LEADERS IN- GOING FORGOT. A WELL I WAS BABY HEALTH APP CREATE THAT FOR FROM THE GOVERNOR I GUESS WAS A SAY IS THAT- FROM I UNDERSTAND THIS REALLY IN ANY WAY A CROSS UNIVERSE. CALL WITH BETWEEN YOU SEE AND THE UNIVERSITY COULD YOU KNOW CLEARLY- YUP CHINA IS I THINK RIGHT NOW THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. PERHAPS THERE'S EVEN SOME TALKING TO BECOME THE LARGEST ECONOMY- IT'S COULD BE PART OF THE WORLD CLIMATE CHANGE IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM- CAL AND TWELVE CERTAINLY WE DO NEED TO SORT OUT THESE OTHER ISSUES AS A COUNTRY THE UNITED STATES WITH THE- GOVERNMENT OF- OF- OF. MAIENSCHEIN THAT- IT THE CERTAINLY WE ALSO NEED TO ALSO COOPERATE AS WELL TO TAKE TO ADDRESS THESE EXISTENTIAL THREATS SO. I APPRECIATE THAT- USE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA- WITHOUT STATE FUNDING BUT IS GOING TO ACTUALLY LEAST WORK WITH- ACADEMICS IS WELL OVER AND- IN CHINA OVER IT WITH THEIR LEADING UNIVERSITY AS WELL TO TRY AT LEAST DEVELOP. SOLUTIONS THAT CAN THAT TRY TO ADDRESS THIS EXISTENTIAL THREATS SO. THAT APPRECIATE YOU PRESENTING THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER PAN CENTER TOWBOAT. GOOD MORNING. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHILD I HAVE A QUESTION- WITH THE HISTORY OF THE THIS COLLABORATION HOW- HOW RECEPTIVE AND EFFECTIVE HOW RECEPTIVE HAS. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT BEEN TO THE FINDINGS OF THIS COLLABORATION IN THE PAST. WHAT THEY'VE BEEN WHAT THEY'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR TEAM IN FACT I KNOW THAT THE LAST YEAR- THERE WAS THE TRAINING SYMPOSIUM THAT TOOK PLACE. BETWEEN THE TWO AND- THERE HAVE BEEN ALSO TWO DIFFERENT SEPARATE DIALOGUES OUT THAT TOOK PLACE NOW THERE'S ALSO I UNDERSTAND- THE STUDY BEING DONE ON A NET- ON- CARBON NEUTRALITY- AND THAT'S BEING WORKED ON SO IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN WORKING WELL LOOK BETWEEN THE TWO IN FACT WHEN WE INTRODUCED A BILL ORIGINALLY IT WAS LIKE A YEAR AND A HALF AGO- BUT BECAUSE OF A PANDEMIC WE WERE NOT ABLE TO PURSUE. WITH THE BILL BECAUSE IT BECOMES HOUSING COMMITTEE SO YOU KNOW IT HAS BEEN WORKING- WELL END UP YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO KIND OF ADD ANY MORE TO IT I THINK THAT'S YEAH I WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE IT LOOK- WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST THE CITY CALIFORNIA'S ACTUALLY BEEN IN CHINA HAS WORKED ON BUILDING EFFICIENCIES. AND WORKING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF CARBON PRICING- AND THAT'S BEEN POSITIVE NOW ARE YOU ASKING ME IF I SEEM BIG- RESPONSES THE VINCE WAS NO I HAVE IT IN WE MOVED CHINA IS NOT DOING ANYWHERE NEAR ENOUGH NORRIS CALIFORNIA. THE UNITED STATES DOES THE WORLD LOOK WE'RE CHIPPING AWAY NO GUARANTEE THAT WE DO IS SIX FEET AND MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT WILL WORK WITH CHINA JOINT IS RUN BY THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA THAT'S THE WAY IT IS BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS. CALIFORNIA IS LITERALLY FACING- REAL DANGER AND FOREST FIRES I'M SITTING HERE WONDERING WHETHER ALL YOU MAY BE ABLE TO STAY HERE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS BECAUSE THE THREAT OF FIRE THE- OAK TREES USED TO BE GREEN AND I GREEN RIGHT NOW- THE- CHAPARRAL IS TURNING BROWN AND DYING WE'RE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIRST ADAPTED ACT AND WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE THE GROWING. THAT THE CONTINUING BUT THE GROWING THREAT. AND THEN FACE THE CHOICE THE RUSSIA AND THE U. S. EUROPE AND EVERYBODY ELSE SO YEAH YOU READY TO DO GOOD. HOW MUCH- IT. WHAT I'M DOING THE I CAN BY THE TO SOME GOOD. SCIENTISTS CAN NOW WITH OUR. HELPING BUT- IN COMING BACK IN THE AT THIS THE YEAR TWO. IS HE PRETTY. WHAT WE'RE DOING- THIS IS FREE- YOU DOING MY WILL. SERVICE CENTER. AND QUITE TRYING I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF WE GOT A COUPLE. VOTES BECAUSE THE POLITICAL ACTION THROUGH THE OF OUR COUNTRY IS GOING TO UNDERMINE THIS EVEN MORE THAN CHINA SO I APPEAL. TO YOUR SENSE OF- OF COMMITMENT- TO OUR DEMOCRACY TO OUR COUNTRY WORKING ON SOMETHING THAT- IS NOT PERFECT- BUT I CAN TELL YOU. BASED ON MY LONG EXPERIENCE OF FIFTY IN A ROW POLITICS THIS IS A POSITIVE- HALFWAY THERE WERE FALLING AND IT WILL BE EASY OTHER THAN THAT- AS LONG AS I'M. CHAIRMAN OF THE INSTITUTE. THANK YOU GOVERNOR CENTRAL TO. THE HAVE ANYTHING. GREAT THANK YOU VERY. BOB YES CENTER DOLLY AND THEN CENTER CORTESE. GOSH DARN THIS IS WENT FULL CIRCLE NOW- MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILL THIS. THE CONVERSATION IS REALLY DRAFTED INTO. A LOT OF OTHER THINGS SO- BUT I WANT TO JUST MAKE A COMMENT THAT IN IN MY PERSPECTIVE I THINK THE GOVERNOR BROUGHT UP A REALLY GOOD POINT ABOUT YOU KNOW FIRE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT- THIS NOT IN THIS COMMITTEE MUCH BUT- YOU CALIFORNIA'S LED THE WAY. WHEN IT COMES TO. LEADING THE WORLD IN. THE BILL YOU TO BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE PROACTIVE IN FIGHTING OFF CARBON EMISSIONS. I WOULD SAY WE'VE DONE WE'VE SPENT THAT MONEY WE'VE TAX THE PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESSES OF CALIFORNIA AND WE'VE RUN A LOT OF THEM OUT AND MANY OF THOSE COMPANIES AND CORPORATIONS HAVE. GONE TO CHINA WHERE IT'S A LOT EASIER- TO MANUFACTURE AND PRODUCE THE PRODUCTS THAT WE ALL USE- IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY DON'T. DO THE SAME THINGS WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO IT'S PUT CALIFORNIA AT A MAJOR DISADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO BEING ABLE TO. PRODUCE THE THINGS THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED HERE AND PROMOTE THE JOBS HERE- AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS THAT WE FOCUS ON THINGS THAT ARE- NOT ALWAYS THE BEST PRIORITY OF THE WAY WE SPEND THE MONEY WE HAVE. I KNOW SOMETHING THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS BEEN. IT'S NOT JUST GOVERNOR BUT GOVERNOR BROWN HAS BEEN VERY ADAMANT ABOUT IT IS THE BULLET TRAIN AND- AND THAT IS IT IS IN MY OPINION HAS BEEN. THE WORK THE BEST CASE OF THE WORST AMOUNT OF MONEY I EVER SPENT ON TRYING TO REDUCE CARBON- AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'LL EVER BE COMPLETED IN. AND ANYWAY I THINK THAT'S THE OF SODOMY FOLKS ON AND TAKE THOSE RESOURCES AND SPEND THEM ON AREAS WHERE WE KNOW. WE CAN REALLY REDUCE CARBON WHICH IS. FORCED BUYERS. AND SO I THINK THIS DISCUSSION HAS GONE IN THE DIRECTION OF NOT REALLY CLOSE TO WHAT THE BILL. FOR THE GOAL OF THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO DO AND SO FOR THOSE REASON I'M NOT GONNA BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF GOOD POLICY DISCUSSION HERE- THAT. IS NOT IN THIS COMMITTEES EVEN RAIL AND SO MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND- MAYBE WE CAN GET THE GOVERNOR- GOVERNOR BROWN TO COME AND DEBATE SOME OF THOSE. OPTIONS THAT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. ON OUR RELATIONSHIP. WITH CHINA. IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH. THE HUMANS THAT ARE PROVIDING THE THINGS WE USE OVER THERE AND THAT THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE AND THE BASICALLY SLAVES LET'S FACE IT MOST. POPULAR SAY WHAT IT REALLY IS. AND WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE HUMAN. SIDE OF THIS THING AND NOT SO MUCH- THE DIFFERENCES IN. HOW WE- GET THE PRODUCTS WE NEED AND THE COST THE COST OF. WHAT HAPPENS IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT OUR FRIENDS AT THE END F THE DAY THEY'RE TAKING OUR JOBS. AND OUR POLLUTING OUR AIR THE SAME TIME WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT MUCH MOVEMENT AT ALL. IN THEM AND HAVING THE ABILITY. TO BE ABLE TO DO THE RIGHT THING TO CURB. YOU KNOW THEIR MISSIONS. THANK YOU. DOLLARS CENTER CORTESE. IT IS THE GOVERNOR BROWN I'M GONNA GO TO CENTER CORTESE. I WANTED. OFFER RESPONSE TO MY SENATOR THERE. BUT ALL RIGHT WE'LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE WE'RE GIVING YOU A LITTLE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE YOU ARE FORMER GOVERNOR WE WOULDN'T NORMALLY ALLOW THAT LET'S GO TO CENTER CORTESE FIRST. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AND I'LL BE BRIEF IT'S ONE OF. THANK OF THE OFFER PERSONALLY- SHIP- I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T LOSE SIGHT THAT THIS IS A UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. PROGRAM AT THE HEARTIT'S WHY IT'S HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE. I THINK- IT WOULD BE SCARY IF WE WERE TO GET IN THE WAY OF. OF OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM HAVING DIALOGUE- ON AN INTERNATIONAL BASIS REGARDLESS OF. OF POLITICAL PARTISANSHIP OR OR OTHER ISSUES. OF ON AN ISSUE LIKE THIS. WE ARE COULD HAVE ANY. DIALOGUE ON THE DEAD PLAN. IN IN ORDER PEOPLE AND THIS- ON THE POLITICAL SIDE TODAY THIS IS A HUMANITARIAN ISSUE YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY THE PLANET'S GONNA SURVIVE. BUT THE QUESTION IS WHETHER HUMANITY'S GONNA SURVIVE. AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF TIME FOR POLARIZATION AND I THINK THIS IS A GREAT. EXAMPLE OF MOVING FOR THE KIND OF DIALOGUE THAT. WE SHOULD ALL BE ENGAGED IN AS QUICKLY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN- TO ADDRESS OF THE CLIMATE ISSUE SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING AFFORD THEN I'M I'M PROBABLY HAPPY TO CAST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU FOR COMING THANK YOU CENTER CORTESE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE'RE GOING TO GO TO YOU FOR YOUR CLOTHES WOULD YOU BE OPPOSED TO GOVERNOR BROWN HELPING YOU WITH YOUR CLOTHES NO NO NOT AT ALL PLEASE CLICK. GOVERNOR YOU GOT ONE MINUTE OKAY LET METELL YOU THE FACTS ALL YOU FOLKS KNOW ABOUT RAISING MONEY. I RAISE TWO MILLION BUCKS FOR THIS THING I WOULD RAISE MILLIONS MORE WHERE DOES THAT MONEY GO IT GOES TO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WE'RE HIRING PEOPLE WE HAVE THREE PHD. WE HAVE. STUDENTS THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE GETTING INSTRUCTION AND BENEFITS EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS BECAUSE OF THIS- INSTITUTE BECAUSE THE MONEY WILL RAISING.

OF THIS- TELL ME OF COLUSA- THE HERE ARE SUFFERING AND THEY'RE GONNA SUFFER MY- IN THE FIGHT. AND THE LACK OF WATER WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND THIS IS A VERY TINY MODEST EFFORT BUT IT'S ALL GOOD AND THERE'S NOT A SINGLE THING WRONG WITH IT. AND ARE YOU URGE YOU TO AT LEAST UP STAYING AND THINK ABOUT IT A LITTLE LONGER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOVERNOR- DO WE HAVE A MOTION. CENTER GLAZER I COULD MAKE A QUICK COMMENT IN MY MAKING THE MOTION THAT YES THIS BILL. ONLY IT JUST AUTHORIZES THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO ESTABLISH IT THAT'S ALL THAT THIS BILL DOES. SO FOR THERE'S A LOT OF SOURCE WORLD POLITICS IN OUR WORLD SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED TODAY- AND I JUST WOULD NOTE THAT- YOU KNOW FOR THE IF. FOR THOSE WHO CARE ABOUT CLIMATE. THAT THIS IS A VERY MODEST AT THE SHOW THAT RECORD THE RECOGNIZE THAT AND I WOULD MOVE THAT BILL TODAY.

TO RECEIVE VOTING POWER GIVEN BOTH STUDENTS VOTING RIGHTS- AS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KNOW WHEN A STUDENTS APPOINTED TO THE BOARD. THEY SERVE A YEAR AS A NON VOTING MEMBER OF THE BOARD AND AT THE COMPLETION OF THAT YEAR THEN THEY BECOME THE VOTING STUDENT REGION. THIS BILL WOULD INVEST BOTH STUDENTS WITH A VOTE- DOES THAT STUDENT REGION WOULD BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AS A VOTING MEMBER FROM THE START- AS WE ALL KNOW THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS PLACE TO DRAMATIC BURDEN ON THE UNIVERSITIES TEN CAMPUS SYSTEM. AND IT'S FORCING OUR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS TO MAKE HARDER AND HARDER DECISIONS ABOUT. THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT STUDENTS ARE THE ONES WHO KNOW MOST ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY ARE FACING. AND THEIR VOICES WILL BE ESSENTIAL IN TACKLING THESE CHALLENGES AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS. STUDENTS BRING DIVERSE EXPERIENCES SPECIAL PERSPECTIVES. AND THEIR UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO OFFER THE BOARD DATED A FEEDBACK ABOUT THEIR UNIVERSITIES. AND HOW THEY FUNCTION IN MANY IMPORTANT PLACES. S. C. A. FIVE WILL ALLOW ONE ADDITIONAL VOTING STUDENT REGENT. AS YOU KNOW WELL THERE'S TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS AT THE UC. AND A SECOND STUDENT VOICE- IS WARRANTED TODAY HAVE.

HI THANK YOU SO MUCH- I'M ALISON A SECOND YEAR STUDENT AT UC SANTA BARBARA. CALIFORNIANS VESTED IN ENTIRE EDUCATION SYSTEM ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT EVERYONE IN OUR STATE WOULD BE BEST OFF WHEN EVERYONE HAS A CHANCE TO REALIZE THE FULL MEASURE OF THEIR TALENT. THE COLLEGES CSU AND UC ALIKE SYMBOLISES OF ALWAYS BEEN ESSENTIAL TO MAKING GOOD ON THAT MISSION TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL. THE UC STUDENT REGENT STARTED THE BOARD'S BASIC NEEDS COMMITTEE WHICH SPARKED DEBATE ON THE BOARD AND IN THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT HOW TO MAKE SURE STUDENTS FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO THRIVE. THEY DON'T NEED A CONVERSATION ON TUITION HIKES PROTECTING THE MISSION OF OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND CSU THE LEGISLATURE RT FROM THE NEED FIRST YEAR REPRESENTATION BY CODIFYING VOTING MEMBERSHIP FOR TWO STUDENT TRUSTEES AT EACH. IT'S TIME TO DO THE SAME AT THE UC BY PASSING AS SHE DID FIVE. BECAUSE THE BOARD OF REGENTS ALWAYS DOES TO COMMITTEE BRIT COMMITTEE BREAK OUT SIMULTANEOUSLY STUDENTS ONLY HAVE A VOTING REPRESENTATION ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD COMMITTEES AT THIS TIME. WHEN THE UC WORSE FOR STUDENTS IT WORKS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS BUT PASSING AS SHE FIVE THE LEGISLATURE TO BRING US A STEP CLOSER TO GUARANTEEING FULL ADEQUATE YOU REPRESENTATION ON THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

REMINDER PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO AT THIS TIME TO SHOW OPPOSITION FOR SCA FIVE. AND I'M NOT I'M SURE NOBODY IS GOING UP THANK YOU MR MODERATOR FOR IT WILL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE DISEASE SENATOR PAM. THANK THANK YOU- AND CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE GOALS OF THE STRIKES THAT DID ONE CLARIFY- BECAUSE AN ANALYSIS IT INDICATES THAT THE VOTING MEMBERSHIP ACTUALLY INCREASES BY TWO SO IS THAT. BUT YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE'S ONE VOTING STUDENTS SO WE'RE TAKING THE OTHER STUDENTS SO I'M JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE PERHAPS YOU CAN ALSO DRESSES THAT. HELLO STUDENTS SELECTED I UNDERSTAND SELECTED BY THE REGION'S THEMSELVES THIS THIS AMENDMENTS ACTUALLY GIVE SOME FLEXIBILITY SO THAT IF PERHAPS THE SUSAN CELLS CAN VOTE FOR THEIR OWN REPRESENTATIVES INSTEAD OF THE BODY ITSELF BASICALLY POINTING SOMEONE TO THERE'S TO THEMSELVES. PLEASE THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR PAN IN REGARD TO THE FIRST QUESTION- THE STUDENT REGENT THAT SELECTED TODAY IS AN OPTIONAL. IT'S AN AUTHORIZATION BY THE CONSTITUTION BUT IT'S AN OPTIONAL CHOICE BY THE BY THE BOARD. AND SO- THE BOARD MAKE UP IS TWENTY FIVE BUT THE BOARD HAS ALLOWED A STUDENT TO BE DESIGNATED AS A VOTING MEMBER- BY CHOICE THIS MEMBER THIS MEASURE. WOULD ACTUALLY. TELL THAT DESIGNATE TO VOTING STUDENTS- AS A CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE AND THAT'S WHY THE MEMBERSHIP INCREASES TO TWENTY SEVEN. TO TWENTY FIVE- IN REGARD TO THE SELECTION AND STUDENT AND LIKE TO ASK. OF MY WITNESSES SAID THEY COULD ADDRESS THAT THAT THAT PROCESS IF IT IF IT WOULD YES A CHALLENGE FOR YOU STILL ON THE LINE. AND JUST JUST TO CLARIFY I'M JUST SAYING THAT IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE ACE S. C. A. DOES IT ACTUALLY SPEAK TO THE SELECTION OR DOES IT SILENCE ON SELECTION PROCESS SO. IT'S PRETTY CHEAP THE TESTIMONY ABOUT HOW THEY'RE DOING IT. NOW BUT DOES IT CONSTRAINED- SELECTION. ORDERS BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING COSTUMES AENDMENT IS YOUR IS A PERMISSIVE EOUGH TO ALLOW ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF SELECTION THAT PERHAPS COULD BETTER REFLECT THE STUDENT VOICE STAND. THAT REGION SOME CELLS ESSENTIALLY POINTING THE STUDENT A DAYLIGHT. TO THEIR OWN BODY TO VOTE. ALL OF THE AUTHOR ANSWER BUT I BELIEVE IT'S OPTIONAL. I'M SCOTT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WHAT COMMITTED TO THE ISSUE THAT YOU RAISED- AND AS FAR AS I KNOW IT'S NOT ADDRESSED IN THE BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN THAN HAPPY TO- AT WELCOME ANY SUGGESTIONS OR THOUGHTS ABOUT IT AND- WOULD ENCOURAGED BY THE STUDENT LEADERSHIP TO ALSO WEIGH IN ON THAT. BUT I THINK YOU RAISE AN IMPORTANT POINT AND I'M I'M- VERY INTERESTED IN. TRYING TO WORK THAT ISSUE AN APPROPRIATE WAY. OKAY I WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT IT'S AS YOU'RE IN SOME INDIA CA. OF COURSE CUT TO TWO MEN THAT WOULD CONSTRAIN AND SAY THAT THE ONLY WAY TO SELECT THE STUDENT IS THE- REGION'S THEMSELVES OF POINTING AT. IT SILENT IN THE- IF THE OPPORTUNITY WHICH WE MAY ADDRESS WHETHER IT'S AND LEGISLATION OR OTHER. MECHANISMS TO ADDRESS THAT ARE YOU SEE ITSELF AND ADDRESS THAT. THAT'S FINE- I JUST WANNA BE SURE THAT THERE WASN'T LANGUAGE INDIA C. ITSELF. PERTAINING TO STUDENT REGENT THAT WOULD MANDATE THAT THE- REGENTS THEMSELVES ARE THE APPOINTING BODY FOR THE STUDENTS REASONS. AS I READ IT IS SILENT SO I THINK YOU I THINK YOUR CONCERNS- ARE FINE. ANY OTHER. SKEWS ME. YES AND- TROUBLED. SO MUCH A QUESTION BUT MORE OF A COMMENT- SENATE WHICH IS WHY OF THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS MOTION AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IT JUST MAKES ABSOLUTE SENSE I I'M SURE THAT WHEN. THE SYSTEM WAS ORIGINALLY IMPLEMENTED THE BODY COUNT WAS IT AS AS LARGE AS WE HAVE NOW SO WE HAVE MORE STUDENTS THAT ARE BEING REPRESENTATIVE AND HAVING ADDITIONAL VOTING MEMBERS ON THERE JUST MAKES LOGICAL SENSE SO THANK YOU.
