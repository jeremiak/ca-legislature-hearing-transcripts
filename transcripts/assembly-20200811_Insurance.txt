CENTER HELLO WELCOME YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE YOUR INDULGENCE THIS MORNING WITH SO MUCH GOING ON. THANK YOU. SHOULD I PROCEED YEAH PLEASE GO AHEAD CENTER THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY NINE A BILL THAT. SEEKS TO PROVIDE NECESSARY MEDICAL CARE FOR OUR FRONT LINE WORKERS FIGHTING COVERT NINETEEN. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY TAKING THE AMENDMENTS. DISCUSSED IN THE ANALYSIS THE STRIKE THE FIVE AND 5% LANGUAGE. AND REPLACE THIS LANGUAGE WITH A PLACEHOLDER TO GIVE US MORE TIME TO WORK ON OUTBREAK OF LANGUAGE. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF. ACTUALLY YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. TO YOU AND IN OUR COLLECTION. COLLABORATION ON THIS THIS LEGISLATION- AND THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH ME AND- OUR STAFF ON THESE ISSUES UNDER THIS TIGHT SCHEDULE. FOR THE SAKE OF BREVITY OUT I WILL NOT BEGIN WITH A LONG DISCUSSION OF COVERT NINETEEN. WE'VE ALL LIVED IT AND ARE CONTINUING TO LIVE IT. SINCE MARCH MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND AMERICANS HAVE DIED OF OVER NINETEEN THAT'S NEARLY THREE TIMES THE AMERICAN CASUALTIES OF WAR OF THE VIETNAM WAR. AND GREATER THAN ALL OF THE AMERICAN CASUALTIES DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR WHILE MUCH MEDIA ATTENTION HAS BEEN ON THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES OF THIS. PANDEMIC THE SCALE OF HUMAN. IS UNPRECEDENTED IT DIFFICULT TO OVERSTATE. AND THAT'S WHY MISTER CHAIR I AM SO GLAD THAT WE CAME TOGETHER TO CO AUTHOR SB ELEVEN FIFTY NINE. THIS BILL EXTENDS A COVERT NINETEEN REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION. TO BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR WORKERS. BUT IT DOES SO CAREFULLY TO BALANCE THE NEEDS OF WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS IN CALIFORNIA. SIMPLY PUT THE BILL DOES THREE THINGS. FIRST SB ELEVEN FIFTY NINE CODIFIES THE GOVERNOR'S RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDER COVERING ALL ESSENTIAL WORKERS A JULY FOURTH. SECOND THIS BILL EXTENDS A PRESUMPTION TO FRONTLINE WORKERS FOR COVERT NINETEEN INFECTIONS AFTER JULY FOURTH. THIS INCLUDES PEACE OFFICERS FIREFIGHTERS EMTS AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. FINALLY SB ELEVEN FIFTY NINE EXTENDS A PRESUMPTION TO WORKERS IN THE EVENT OF A COVERT NINETEEN OUTBREAK AT A WORK SITE. THIS IS YOUR IS THE WORKERS WHO ARE AT A HIGHER THAN THE GENERAL PUBLIC. ARE COVERED BY WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTION WHICH WOULD INCLUDE WORK PLACES THAT DID NOT HAVE APPROPRIATE SOCIAL DISTANCING AND MASK POLICIES. I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO FINALIZE THIS LANGUAGE AND PROTECT AS MANY VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS AS POSSIBLE. THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY ADDRESSES THE OCCUPATIONAL TOLD THE PANDEMIC. AND MAKES CALIFORNIA'S WORKPLACES SAFER. THEREFORE NOTING THE URGENCY OF THE MOMENT I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE ON S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY NINE. THERE'S A MOTION AND SECOND TO. TO PASS THE BILL ONE HIGHLIGHT WHAT SENATOR HILL SAID- HE'S PROPOSING TO DELETE THE LANGUAGE THAT DEALS WITH THE FIVE AND FIVE RULE AND THEN HE'S- ASKING FOR THE AMENDMENT THAT WITH THE SO CALLED INTENT LANGUAGE- AND WILL EXPECT MORE DETAIL AT SOME POINT. BEFORE THE END OF THE SESSION ON THAT THEY'RE STILL DISCUSSIONS GOING ON- AND SO FORTH- COMMITTEE MEMBERS DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ABOUT THE BILL AT THIS POINT BEFORE WE IVITE TESTIMONY. MISTER MAYES. YES I DID I CAN I GOT A LETTER FROM THE- FROM THE FIREFIGHTERS-% YESTERDAY- THAT THEY BROUGHT UP SOME GOOD POINTS AND SINCE- THE AUTHOR HAD SAID THAT THIS WAS A WORK IN PROGRESS. THE ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO THE TO BE ABLE TO POINT OUT ARE SOME OF THE THEIR ITEMS ONE OF THEM- IS TO PROVIDE COVERAGE RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY. A TO EXTEND PROTECTION BEYOND SEPARATION OR TERMINATION AT THE PROTECT PROTECTION OF PERSONALLY FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE ORDERED TO QUARANTINE. IS ACTUALLY SEVERAL OTHER ITEMS ON HERE WITHOUT GOING THROUGH ALL OF THE MEASURE YOUR YOU'LL HAVE THE LETTER BUT THEY ACTUALLY MAKE AN AWFUL LOT OF SENSE TO ME AND SINCE THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS WE'VE GOT SOME. LANGUAGE TO AMEND TODAY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE A LOOK- AT THE AT THEIR BY PROPOSALS AS WELL. THANK YOU MISTER MAYES ANY OTHER QUESTIONS TO MR CHAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR INDULGENCE- I WANTED A CLARIFICATION TERMS OF SOME EVENTS THAT WILL BE- BROUGHT TO THE TABLE BY APPRECIATE SENATOR HILL FOR BRING THIS. BILL TO THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE BUT IN THE EVENT AND EMPLOYEES IS EXPOSED SO THEIR COVERT POP UP AUTHORED EMPLOYEES AS REQUIRED FOR QUARANTINE UNDER THIS BILL AND THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS- WANT UNDERSTAND IF THE EMPLOYER WOULD RECEIVING ADDITIONAL PAID LEAVE. FOR THE RECOMMEND FOURTEEN DAY QUARANTINE OR WOULD IT BE EMPLOYEE HAVE TO BE USING THEIR ACCRUED SICK TIME. WHAT. JIM WHAT WAS THE QUESTION OF THAT HAPPENING IS THEY'RE SICKLY SICK TIME IS THAT WOULD BE A QUESTION WAS. YES OKAY VIA- THE- YEAH WE'RE GOING TO REIMBURSE FOR SICK LEAVE- IF- FOR THOSE WHO MUCH QUARANTINE SO THEY YET I MEAN THAT'S- THAT'S A COMMONSENSE CHANGE THAT- WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO HAMMER OUT THE DETAILS. WITH THE LABOR AND THE EMPLOYERS AT THIS POINT BUT THAT WITH THEIR QUARANTINE THEY SHOULD BE. COMPENSATED AND REIMBURSED FOR THAT TIME. AND THAT'S THE GOAL AND WE JUST NEED TO GET THE FINE TUNING OF THAT TO PUT IT TOGETHER. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION VERY APPROPRIATE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR FOR- FOR CLARIFYING THAT MISTER GIBSON HAS A QUESTION. BURKE THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS MORE OF A STATE I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD WE BELIEVE THAT IS PRETTY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER HAS ALREADY- TO GET THE GOVERNOR PUTTING FORTH AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO SPEAK TO THIS AND THANK THE SENATOR FOR PICKING THIS UP BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE. INDIVIDUALS EMPLOYEES SHOULD BE PROTECTED- IN THIS MATTER AND HAPPY THAT HE ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENTS IT SEEMS ABSOLUTELY REASONABLE I SAW THIS PRIOR AND AGAIN IT'S ONE BIG THREE LEADERSHIP ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MR GIBSON. MISCON LONGER. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FORWARD THIS- REALLY IMPORTANT BILL I HAVE ALSO BEEN RECEIVING LETTERS AND TAKING CALLS FROM ADVOCATES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE- AND WANTED I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU COULD- ADDRESS.

SPECIFICALLY PROTECT THE WORKERS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON AS WE GO FORWARD SO WE WILL HAVE THE LANGUAGE ONE THREE IN THE NEXT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE WE'RE- TWO WEEK TIME FRAME.

THAT WHEN A JUDGE THE VALUE THE LAW THEY HAVE TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF THE INJURED WORKER IN PROVIDING BENEFITS TO THE INJURED WORKER. TO THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CLAIMS ARE BEING ACCEPTED RIGHT NOW THERE'S TWO MAJOR REASONS THAT THEY'RE NOT I WANT TO TOUCH ON THOSE BRIEFLY BECAUSE THEY SHOULD BE ELIMINATED. ONE PEOPLE FILE CLAIMS WHEN THEY'RE NOT SURE THEY'RE ACTUALLY SICK THEY KILLED THOUGH THEY HAVE NO EXPOSURE AND SO THEY NEED TO GO AHEAD AND FILE A CLAIM. AS A PROTECTIVE MEASURE UP COMPLETELY REASONABLE- WHAT HAPPENS A LOT OF THE CASE THAT THEY NEVER GET SECOND I NEVER CAST BECAUSE THE POCKET OF THE CODE THAT. WE ARE REQUIRED BY LAW AT THAT POINT TO ACT ON THOSE CLAIMS EITHER ACCEPT OR DENY THEM WITHIN THE STATUTORY PERIOD. OF THOSE PLANS ULTIMATELY DENIED. THE OTHER MAJOR CATEGORY THAT WE'VE SEEN SOMEWHERE- YOU KNOW NORTH OF TEN PERCENT. IS IN THE ACTUAL CLAIM FORM. THE INJURED WORKER TOLD US THAT THEY DIDN'T GET IT AT WORK. SO THEY WILL FILE A CLAIM FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION ON THE CLAIM FORM THEY'LL SAY I GOT PREVENT FROM. MY WIFE MY SPOUSE MY CHILD WHATEVER IT STATE THEY GIVE US A FACTUAL BASIS. FOR IT NOT OCCURRING AT WORK. I ON SECTION TWO. WHICH I UNDER. IS THE BILL'S. WITH VERY QUICKLY THIS CHAIR WE TWO MAJOR CONCERN. WHY X. BROAD. 60% OF THE- COLA. THAT THE- CLAIMS COATED INFECTION ARE. INSIDE OF THE CATEGORIES OF EMPLOYEES COVERED BY SECTION TWO OF THE BILL. SO WE JUST DON'T SEE A NEED. TO CREATE A COMPLICATED. TRIGGER ON TRIGGER OFF MECHANISM THAT REQUIRES A BUNCH OF DATA TRACKING- FOR DIRECT OF THE EMPLOYEES WHERE. THE DATA WOULD INDICATE THAT THERE IS NOT A HIGH CONCENTRATION. OF INFECTIONS OR A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF RISK. THERE'S ONE MAJOR ISSUE THAT I DO WANT TO RAISE- ROLLED INTO THIS CLUSTER. APPROACH THAT HAD MAJOR CONCERNS MY NUMBER IS NOT AS- IF WE HAVE TO SIMILARLY SITUATED EMPLOYEES SAY THERE'S- DAY DO THE SAME JOB THEY WORK IN THE SAME LOCATION. BUT ONE OF THEM BABY GOT SICK DURING THE PERIOD. TRANSACTION THE ONE DIDN'T MAYBE THE FACT FOR BOTH. ARE NOT CLEAR. AS AN EMPLOYER WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PICK UP ONE AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO PICK UP THE OTHER AND IT PUTS US IN A SITUATION OF TREATING VERY SIMILAR EMPLOYEES VERY DEFINITELY. THAT'S EXTRAORDINARILY PROBLEMATIC FROM THE WORK. PERSPECTIVE SO WITH THAT. WE URGE YOU TO VOTE FOR THE MEASURE DESPITE THE FACT. I'M OPPOSED TO IT- IT'S A STRANGE POSITION AND I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. WE REALLY PREPARED ALL. FIFTEEN DOT. WE. TO REACH. AN OUTCOME WE CAN. ALL BE PROUD OF AS WE BEFORE THANK YOU CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER SCHMIDT. IN I'VE WAS A ONE OTHER PER IN. SORT OF PRIMARY OPPONENT.

YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AB CAN MEET IF YOU WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR AND HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER BECAUSE WE UNDERSTOOD THAT DURING THE SHUTDOWN PAGE INTO PANDEMIC THERE WAS A NEED TO ADDRESS THE RISK ISN'T TO WORKERS. THAT THEY WERE UNDERTAKING JUST BY LEAVING THEIR HOMES- IN INTERACTING WITH THE PUBLIC BUT SINCE THEN THE LOCK DOWN THE LARGELY BEEN LIFTED IN WORKPLACES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMPLEMENT APPROPRIATE SAFETY MEASURES SO WE NO LONGER SEE THE NEED FOR A BROAD AND EXPANSIVE PRESUMPTION EXCEPT PERHAPS FOR THE MOST ESSENTIAL EMPLOYEES THAT HAVE UNSTRUCTURED CONTACT WITH THE WITH THE PUBLIC ESPECIALLY PRESUMPTION THAT EXTENDS OVER THREE YEARS INTO THE FUTURE GIVEN HOW DRASTICALLY OUR LIVES CHANGED IN JUST A FEW MONTHS- BUT THAT BEING SAID THAT THE INTEREST. WILL BE THIRTY NINE ARTICLE WAS BEEN TO WORK WITH THE OFFICE ON THE SCOPE OF THE BILL WOULD BE HEARD TODAY AND THE EVENTUALLY CONTENT GOING TO BROADEN THE BILL EVEN FURTHER PLACES COUNTIES AND OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN JEOPARDY OF. NOT CAUGHT TO OUR- OKAY. HELP FUND WORKER PROGRAM.

THIS COMMITTEE- AS A MATTER OF LAW- IS VERY- COMFORTABLE WITH THE REVIVAL PRESUMPTION ASIF AS IT AFFECTS OUR PEACE OFFICERS- AND FIREFIGHTERS- AND IT MAKES A PERFECT SENSE- IN IN REGARDS TO REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION FOR THAT CARE WORKERS MAKES PERFECT SENSE AS WELL. I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT SECTION THREE- AS THE WAY THE FORMULA THAT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN REGARDS TO ALL EMPLOYEES THAT NOW COURSE HAS BEEN AMENDED THERE'S INTENT LANGUAGE THAT THAT'S THERE AND BECAUSE OF MY AFFECTION FOR THE AUTHOR- HAD MY AFFECTION FOR THE CHAIR- AND STAFF I KNOW THAT YOU GUYS WILL BE WORKING DILIGENTLY- AS WE AS WE MOVE THROUGH.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK THE CENTER FOR BRING THIS BILL FORWARD- IT'S IMPORTANT FOR FIRST RESPONDERS ARE FIREFIGHTERS OR POLICE OFFICERS THEY DON'T HAVE A CHOICE TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE THEY'RE GOING TO HOMES THEY'RE SUPPOSED DAY IN AND DAY OUT AS FAR AS OUR HEALTHCARE WORKERS GOAL OF MY DAUGHTER'S IN THERE SHE'S A ARE IN A HOSPITAL DOWN HERE A COUPLE MILES AWAY AND PEOPLE GET SICK THEY GO TO HOSPITALS SO THEY SEE THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED DAY IN AND DAY OUT. IT IS TOUGH IN REDUCING THE DEATH AND WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS AND TO ME IT'S A SMALL LAST TO MIX WE PROTECT OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS WHO ARE VITAL AND- RIGHT NOW THE CURVAS HOPEFULLY FLATTENING BUT THOSE FOLKS DON'T HAVE A CHOICE THEY HAVE TO GO TO WORK THERE DEAL WITH THE FORMAL SICK PEOPLE. SO FOR THE- VOTING I. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER- COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY OTHER STATEMENTS OR QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR. I'M A JOINT AUTHORED TOO SO I GUESS I'M IN THE SAME BOAT A MISTER COOLEY HAS A STATEMENT OR QUESTION. BECAUSE THIS IS TIED TO CLOVER THIS IS ACTUALLY A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH IS INTENSE NOW. AND IN GENERAL WE DO THINK A LITTLE TALE ALL. BY SOME MEANS HERD IMMUNITY VACCINE SO IT ACTUALLY IS DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF THE OTHER ERRORS WHICH WE'VE EXPANDED PRESUMPTIONS. OR RESPECT FOR CONTINUITY OVER TIME THE GENERAL AND SO THE FAX SO I THINK FOR PEACE OF MIND TO SUPPORT PEOPLE WHO ARE. FIGHTING THE BATTLE I THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE. BUT  DO THINK AS POLICY MAKERS IT'S WELL TO NOTE THAT THIS IS A- CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH OVER TIME. WE DO ANTICIPATE WON'T BE WORSE AND VERY LIKELY WILL BE DIFFERENT THE WAY IT UNFOLDS AS A PRESUMPTION.
