TWENTY EIGHT NO SIX THE MEASURE PASSES MEMBERS BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT ITEM I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU ALL TO GIVE A BIG SENATE WELCOME TO SOME OF CENTER WHITE HOUSE THESE NEIGHBORS FROM MARJORY DRIVE IN FREMONT WELCOME TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE. WE ARE STILL ON SENATE THIRD READING MOVING TO FILE ITEM THIRTY FOUR SENATOR WIENER. SENATOR WIENER REJECTED PRESENT YOUR BILL. MANDAMUS PLEASE READ FOLLOWING THIRTY FOUR. SENATE BILL ELEVEN OH SIX BY SENATOR WIENER AN ACT RELATING TO RESENTENCING CENTER WIENER. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH RUNNING PRESIDENT- COLLEAGUES- S. B. ELEVEN OH SIX THE FRESH START ACT I WILL HELP PEOPLE TO CLEAR THEIR CRIMINAL RECORDS BY ENSURING THAT OUTSTANDING RESTITUTION AND RESTITUTION FINES ARE NOT A BARRIER TO EXPUNGE. ARE CURRENTLY PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE FREQUENTLY DENIED EXPUNGEMENT EVEN IF THEY'RE OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY OUTSTANDING RESTITUTION AND RESTITUTION FINES RESTITUTION THAT IS OFTEN THE ONLY THING HOLDING SOMEONE BACK FROM CLEARING THE RECORD AND FINING. AND HOUSING- ADDITIONALLY WHEN SETTING RESTITUTION AMOUNTS QUARTER NOT REQUIRED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A PERSON'S ABILITY TO PAY THAT RESTITUTION THIS MEANS THAT VICTIMS OF CRIME WHO WERE AWARDED RESTITUTION OVERWHELMINGLY RECEIVED EITHER NOTHING OR A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE RESTITUTION. BECAUSE OF THE TENANTS SIMPLY LACKS THE RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY PAYER. CARLAW COURTS TO THAN A REQUEST FOR EXPUNGEMENT EVEN IF THE INDIVIDUAL IS OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE IF THEY HAVE ANY OUTSTANDING UNPAID RESTITUTION. ON A CORK AND THEN I EXPANSION ON THIS BASIS EVEN IF THE DEFENDANT IS LIVING IN POVERTY. THIS KIND OF BARRIER TO REENTRY DOES NOT INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT SOMEONE WILL PAY THE RESTITUTION IN FACT BLOCKING SOMEONE FROM CLEARING THEIR RECORDS MAKES IT EVEN LESS LIKELY THAT THEY'LL EVER BE IN A POSITION TO PAY THE RESTITUTION. I WANT TO BE VERY VERY CLEAR. S. B. ELEVEN OH SIX DOES NOT IN ANY WAY REDUCE OR ELIMINATE A PERSON'S RESTITUTION THE AMOUNT THAT A PERSON WAS A RESTITUTION THIS BILL DOES NOT TOUCH. THE RESTITUTION OWED- NOR DOES IT IMPACT THE COURT'S ABILITY TO ENFORCE RESTITUTION ORDERS IT SIMPLY. PROVIDES THAT UNPAID RESTITUTION WILL NOT BE A BARRIER. TO EXPLAINS RUN- SERVICE SOMEONE CAN RE ENTER. SOCIETY AND GET THEIR LIFE BACK ON TRACK COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR NIVEAU. THANK YOU CENTER WIENER MEMBERS JUST. AND OR DEBATE SO NIELSEN. AT A PRESS LADIES IN GENTLEMEN SENATE HOW MUCH MORE DISTRICTS CAN THIS LEGISLATURE KEEP UPON OUR VICTIMS. THE OF. WHO HAVE TO SUFFERED A LOSS OF SOME KIND AT THE HANDS OF A CRIB OFFENDERS. AND NOW THEY WON'T EVEN MAYBE HAVE TO PAY RESTITUTION. I'VE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME AND FOR MOST OF HISTORY AT LEAST MY HISTORY. THESE INDIVIDUALS NEVER PAID RESTITUTION ANYWAY. AND DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION MADE LITTLE ATTEMPT TO EVER RECOVER THE RESTITUTION- OWED TO VICTIMS VICTIMS MEANING SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THEM THEIR LIVES OR THEIR PROPERTY. AND NOW WE DON'T REQUIRE MAIL. WE LESSEN THE SENTENCES FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING EVEN FOR THE WORST OFFENDERS. WE DON'T PUT PEOPLE IN PRISON VERY MUCH ANYMORE. AND NOW WE'RE GONNA THE NIGHT RESTITUTION. WHICH MOST CRIMINAL OFFENDERS HAVE NOT AND WILL NOT PAY ANYWAY ALWAYS JUST REMOVING THE JUDICIAL DISCRETION. WOW I SO WHAT DOES THAT SAY TO THE JUDGES NOW YOU'RE ON THE SPOT HUH. THE DISRESPECT OUR VICTIMS LIKE OUR LEGISLATURE HAS DISRESPECTED OUR VICTIMS ANOTHER LADIES AND GENTLEMAN I URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU CENTER NELSON SENATOR MELINDA. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT WHAT THE RESTITUTION COSTS ACTUALLY GO TOWARD THIS IS NOT- YOU KNOW SOME BIG PAY OUT THAT A VICTIM GETS THE USER THE MONEY PAID IN RESTITUTION GOES TO THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO PAY FOR THINGS LIKE EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS TO PAY FOR THINGS LIKE IF THEY HAD TO RE LOCATE. BECAUSE THEIR PROPERTY THEIR HOME WAS DAMAGED- BECAUSE- YOU KNOW OUT OF FEAR FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY THEY HAD TO RELOCATE THEIR FAMILIES THIS IS USER BIG EXPENSES THE VICTIMS FAMILIES ARE VICTIMS THEMSELVES MUST ENCOURAGE AND THAT IS WHAT IS BEING AFFECTED HERE. I'M THE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT IS. THE MADE BY THE- DISTRICT ATTORNEYS TO SAY. I'M IN THE THEY SAID THE MANY EXPUNGEMENT IN RELATED POST CONVICTION REHABILITATION STATUTES PROVIDE CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS. FINISHED WITH THEIR SENTENCES A CLEAN SLATE. TO APPLY FOR JOBS GET BENEFITS AND GENERALLY RE INTEGRATE INTO SOCIETY AS PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS. AND THAT IS A USEFUL BENEFIT PROMOTE THEM IN SOCIETY BUT- TAKING AWAY THE REQUIREMENT THAT THESE DEFENDANTS COMPLETE THE RESTITUTION ORDER TO VICTIMS. IN THE FINE THAT THEY MUST PAY BEFORE OBTAINING RELIEF FAVORS THESE DEFENDANTS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE VICTIMS. AND IT PLACES A HARD STOP IN THE FACE OF TRUE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. THE COURTS HEARING THESE MOTIONS ALREADY HAVE THE DISCRETION TO GRANT OR DENY THEM. EVEN IF RESTITUTION IS UNPAID. TAKING THAT DISCRETION COMPLETELY WAY NOT ONLY MAKES A SOCIAL CHOICE. IN FAVOR OF DEFENDANTS OVER VICTIMS BUT ALSO IN FAVOR DEFENDANTS OVER THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT IN THE STATE. REMOVING DISCRETION TO CONSIDER RESTITUTION FINES AFFECTS NOT ONLY THE COURTS. BUT IT AFFECTS VICTOR. DIRECTLY IN INDIRECTLY BECAUSE THOSE FIND HELP PAY THE STATE'S VICTIM COMPENSATION. AND DIRECTORS TO XIN TO VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIME I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THAT WHEN YOU'RE VOTING ON THIS BILL AND I WOULD- URGE IN NOVA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MELINDA SAN. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM HERE IS. WHEN THE COURT ORDERS RESTITUTION AS PART OF THE SENTENCING PROCESS. AND THE INDIVIDUAL HAS COMPLETED ALL OF THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO FINISH THIS EXCEPT PAY THE RESTITUTION. MORE TIMES THAN NOT THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE DIFFICULTY GETTING A JOB. IN THIS ARGUMENT THAT MY FRIENDS WHO ARE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ARE MAKING IS RATHER CIRCUITOUS IT'S CIRCULAR. VICTIMS NEED THE MONEY KORUGAR RESTITUTION YOU SHOULD BE PAYING RESTITUTION BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE WE'RE NOT GOING TO EXPLAINS THE SENTENCE SO YOU CAN GET A JOB AND PAY THE RESTITUTION. AND HOW IN THE WORLD IS AT WORK. AND WE CAN SAY JUDGES AND I HAVE FRIENDS THAT OUR JUDGES HAVE THE DISCRETION TO DO THAT BUT LISTEN TO THE PRESSURE THAT WE PUT ON OURSELVES HERE ONE SIDEOR THE OTHER. THE PRESSURE IS PUT ON A JUDGE IN A COURT. AND WE EXPECT THE JUDGE TO WITHSTAND THE PRESSURE AND DO THE RIGHT THING SOMETIMES THEY DO BUT SOMETIMES THEY DON'T BECAUSE JUDGES STAND FOR REELECTION AS WELL. AND THEY CANNOT ENGAGE IN THE TYPE OF PARTISAN POLITICAL CAMPAIGNING BUT WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO DEFEND THE POSITIONS THAT WE TAKE. IN THIS CHAMBER SO I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I THINK. WHEN A PERSON HAS SATISFIED THE SENTENCE OF THE COURT HAS IMPOSED FOR THE CRIME THAT WAS COMMITTED. THE AND I'M I THINK VICTIMS DESERVE RESTITUTION I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE MONEY GETS TO THE VICTIMS. BUT INDIVIDUALS DESERVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET A JOB TO EARN THE MONEY. TO PAY THE RESTITUTION. ORDER SO I REASONABLE THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU CENTER ROF MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING NINE CENTER WINNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I SAID IT IN THE BEGINNING BUT APPARENTLY I NEED TO SAY IT AGAIN. THIS BILL DOES NOT IN ANY WAY REDUCE THE RESTITUTION IS OWED BY ONE PENNY THE BILL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HOW MUCH YOU ARE IF THIS IS SIGNED INTO LAW ANYONE WHO OWES RESTITUTION WILL CONTINUE TO- THE SAME AMOUNT OF RESTITUTION WHICH CAN'T BE DISCHARGED IN BANKRUPTCY. BY THE WAY. SO TO SUGGEST THAT THIS SOMEHOW IMPACTS PEOPLE. PEOPLE'S OBLIGATION TO PAY RESTITUTION IS SIMPLY FALSE WHAT THIS BILL DOES DO IS TO SAY WE WANT TO ACTUALLY HELP YOU GET BACK ON YOUR FEET SO THAT YOU CAN GET YOUR LIFE BACK TOGETHER. AND IF PEOPLE CAN'T GET THEIR LIFE BACK TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN EXPUNGEMENT. AND THEY CAN'T GET A GOOD JOB MAYBE THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE HOUSING. BEN THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO PAY FOR A LOT OF THINGS AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO PAY. RESTITUTION AND LET'S BE CLEAR OVERWHELMINGLY PEOPLE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR. THEY WERE PROBABLY POOR GOING INTO PRISON AND THEY'RE DEFINITELY ALMOST CERTAINLY POOR COMING OUT OF PRISON AND TO SAY TO THEM YOU OF THIS RESTITUTION AND WE'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO HELP YOU GET YOUR LIFE BACK TOGETHER BECAUSE YOU'RE POOR AND YOU CAN'T PAY THE RESTITUTION SO YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN YOUR RECORD AND SO YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET A GOOD JOB. HOW DOES THAT HELP VICTIMS THAT DOES NOT HELP THE VICTIMS THAT HARMS VICTIMS- THIS IS A GOOD PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND I ASK FOR YOUR AUTO. THANK YOU CENTER WINNER OF SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
