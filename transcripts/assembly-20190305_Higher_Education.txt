THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE A PRESENT BEFORE YOU AB TWO THIRTY NINE WOULD EXTEND THE SUNSET ON CURRENT LAW TO ALLOW CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. NURSING PROGRAMS TO UTILIZE THE MULTI CRITERIA SCREENING TOOL FOR ADMISSIONS BY THIS MULTI COULD. CRITERIA SCREENING TOOL ALLOWS NURSING PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE IMPACT ON MISSIONS BY ASSESSING A CANDIDATE'S QUALIFICATIONS. AND THEREFORE DECREASES ATTRITION RATES BY ENSURING THE ENTRANCE TO THE PROGRAMMER ADEQUATELY PREPARED TO UNDERTAKE THE COURSE REQUIREMENTS. THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE BUT THE BILL. WITNESSES AND IN SUPPORT. A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRED MEMBERS JUSTIN SILICON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES BOARD OF GOVERNORS THE SPONSOR OF AB. TWO THIRTY NINE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE MULTI CRITERIA SCREENING TOOL WAS DEVELOPED BY NURSING PROGRAMS IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IN ORDER TO LOWER ATTRITION RATES. AND IT IMPROVE SUCCESS RATES FOR ALL STUDENT GROUPS. AND OVER THE YEARS THE PARTICULARS SINCE. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHEN THIS -- MULTI CRITERIA SCREENING TOOLS LAST RE AUTHORIZE WE SEEN AN INCREASE IN PROGRAMS -- USING THE TOOL -- YOU TO SEE MORE PROGRAMS ADD ON AS WE GO FORWARD -- I HAVE WITH ME DOCTOR CAROL MOUNTAIN NURSING DIRECTOR AT SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL ON HOW. THE MULTI CRITERIA SCREEN TOOL. THE BENEFITS OF IT -- AT THE COLLEGES THANK YOU. CHASING MY NAME AGAIN. I'M DOCTOR CAROL MOUNTAIN I'M FROM SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE WE USE THE MULTI SCREENING CRITERIA AS DO MANY OF OUR SISTER SCHOOLS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WE FOUND IT VERY SUCCESSFUL IN HELPING US TO DECREASE OUR ATTRITION RATES AND TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS ARE PREPARED FOR THE RIGOR OF THE NURSING PROGRAMS. SOME OF THE INFLUENCING FACTORS THAT HAVE COME TO PLAY IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AS THE FOCUS ON SAFE PATIENT CARE. THE NEED FOR A STAFF HIGH FACULTY TO STUDENT RATIOS THAT ARE MANDATED BY OUR CLINICAL AGENCIES AND ARE LIMITED QUALIFIED FACULTY TO TEACH THE STUDENTS. SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE BRING STUDENTS INTO THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE FULLY PREPARED AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NEXT TWO YEARS ARE GOING TO BE LIKE FOR THEM -- THE MULTI CARTER'S SELECTION -- PROVIDES THIS AVENUE FOR STUDENTS TO BE PREPARED FOR THE RIGORS OF OUR PROGRAM AND TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO REMEDIATE BEFORE COMING INTO THE PROGRAM. SO THAT THEY CAN BE PREPARED TO NOT ONLY BE COMPLETE AS OF OUR PROGRAM BUT TO PASS AND COLLECTS AND THE PRAXIS AS REGISTERED NURSES SO WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THIS BILL AND HOPE THAT IT WILL STAY WITH US THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SUPPORT. OKAY I THINK WE THE THE RULES THAT I READ WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF BUT I THOUGHT I COULD JUST LISTEN. THE YEAH THIS IS WHO THEY ARE AND OKAY. ALRIGHT BUT LET ME LET ME KNOW WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OKAY. AND IF THERE ARE -- NO WHICH IS IN OPPOSITION AND AND THEN [inaudible] WILL BEGIN. WITH THE WITNESSES AND AND SUPPORT WHEN IT COME UP AND GIVE THEIR NAMES. AND INNOVATION THAT THERE WITH HER MARK MCDONALD MCCALLUM GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE KERN AND FOOT DE ANZA COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS THAT BOTH UTILIZE THIS PROCESS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION RIGHT. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. HER COMMENTS AS CHAIR. PLEASE YEAH I DON'T WANNA HEAR SOME DETAILS ABOUT THE YOUR YOUR YOUR MULTI CRITERIA SCREENING -- MEASURES SO -- HALL RECORDS OF WHAT IT IS. SO WE USE THE A STUDY THAT WAS DONE BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. AND WE LOOK AT THEIR STUDENTS OVERALL GPA SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT ENGLISH PSYCHOLOGY -- NUTRITION NUTRITION NOW THEY TAKE CONTRITION WELL SOME SCHOOLS DO NUTRITION SO AND AT LIKE ANTHROPOLOGY OR SOCIOLOGY SO THAT'S ONE CATEGORY THEN IN A SEPARATE CATEGORY YOU HAVE YOUR SCIENCES WHICH IS MICROBIOLOGY -- ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY AND WE KNOW THAT FOR THAT IF A STUDENT GETS A B. AVERAGE A THREE POINT NO IN THOSE THREE CLASSES WHETHER IT'S DONE BY GETTING ALL BEES OR IN A A C. A B.. IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER BUT IF THEY HIT THAT BE AVERAGE. THAT THEN THEIR CHANCES OF COMPLETING THE PROGRAM AND PASSING AND COLLECTS IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER. SO AT SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE I'M NOT SURE ABOUT DELTA BUT MOST OF THE SCHOOLS DO IT THE SAME WE GIVE POINTS -- FOR BEING A VETERAN WE GIVE POINTS -- FOR SPEAKING A SECOND LANGUAGE HARDSHIP WHICH MOST OF OUR STUDENTS TO HAVE HARDSHIP AND WE DEFINE THAT VERY BROADLY -- JUST DEPENDING FIRST GENERATION GOING LOW INCOME -- THEY GET POINTS IF THEY HAVE ANOTHER LIFE IN A RESTAURANT THERAPIST OR YOU'VE BEEN A FULL BOTTOM MISSED YOU GET ADDITIONAL POINTS FOR THAT AND THEN WE USE THE TEAS TEST ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THAT. SO IT'S A ED TEST THAT DETERMINES BASIC PROFICIENCY IN READING AND SCIENCE AND MATH. AND WE EVERY SCHOOL HAS A WAY THAT A STUDENT CAN REMEDIATE THEIR TEAS TEST THAT HAS TO BE PUT IN PLACE. BUT THAT TEST HELPS TO KNOW THAT THE STUDENT IS PREPARED FOR THE AMOUNT OF READING THAT GOES ON WE MIGHT ASK THE STUDENT TO READ A HUNDRED PAGES A WEEK. EASILY AND SO THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO READ AND COMPREHEND THAT INFORMATION AND THE TEAS TEST IS ONE WAY FOR THEM TO DETERMINE IF THEY NEED TO TAKE AN ADDITIONAL READING CLASS OR IF THEY NEED -- TO STUDY UP ON MATH OR SCIENCE BEFORE THEY COME INTO THE PROGRAM SO THAT WHEN THEY COME INTO OUR FIRST SEMESTER THEY ARE PREPARED FOR THE THE RIGOR AND THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY BASICS. THAT HAVE TO BE KNOWN TO BUILD ON TOP OF THAT DOES THAT EXPLAIN IT TO YOU. YES IS THIS SO. MUCH THAT CRITERIA SCREENING MANAGER IS -- THRALL THE OLD. A COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO WITH A NURSING PROGRAMS. WHAT A STORY OF THEM -- AND SOME ARE IN THE PROCESS OF INSTITUTING IT RIGHT NOW -- THE SMALLER COLLEGES WHERE THEY HAVE LESS RESOURCES YOU HAVE TO DO A STUDY AT TO SAY THESE ARE THE FACTORS THAT WE CAN PUT IN PLACE RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENT AROUND OUR COLLEGE AND WHAT EFFECTS IT. SO SOME OF THE SMALLER SCHOOLS IS THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO IT BUT AS MORE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE PUT THIS IN PLACE. EVERYBODY IS ON BOARD ALL OF THEM ARE WILL HAVE INSTITUTED EVENTUALLY. OBVIOUSLY I WERE TO SUPPORT THE IS -- A. B. TWO THIRTY NINE BUT UP BY PASSING THIS MANAGER -- WOULD IT THE MANDATE THOUGHT ALL THE COMMIT COLLEGES SO TO COMPLY. NO THERE'S NO MANDATE AND THE BILL IT'S IT'S IT'S OPTIONAL FOR DISTRICTS TO UTILIZE THIS. SO THAT WAY I BELIEVE WAS FORTY MATTER WAS THE VALUE OF THIS TODAY THAN IF WE DO PASS. SO I THINK TO ANSWER YOUR PREVIOUS QUESTION I BELIEVE THIS IS AN FORTY TWO OF THE NURSING FORTY TWO NURSING PROGRAMS CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED AM CST. AND WHAT IT DOES IS BASICALLY DESIGNED TO ALLOW THOSE STUDENTS TO HAVE THE MOST SUCCESS IN ACTUALLY GRADUATING FROM THESE NURSING PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO IMPACTED. YOU'VE SEEN THE RISE AND HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH CARE NEEDS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE OF SURE. IN YOUR DISTRICT AS WELL AND SO WITH THIS CRITERIA DOES IS IT ALLOWS A LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO UTILIZE AM CST SO WE CAN. HAVE HIGH GRADUATION RATES FOR THESE NURSING PROGRAMS AND FULFILL THAT NEED THAT WE ALL HAVE IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE ENTIRE STATE. AND THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW THOSE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO DEVELOP THE M. C. S. T. PROGRAM IF THEY HAVEN'T DONE SO ALREADY. AND FOR THOSE COLLEGES THAT HAVE IT TO CONTINUE TO OUR HEALTH CARE NEEDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. YES SENSE OF THIS SOUNDS GOOD THAT AND ARE NOT A SURE THAT THE GRADUATION RATE THE WOULD BE HIGH. BECAUSE ALL WHILE WE IF WE MAKE IT -- MANDATED HELPFUL. MANY COLLEGES WITH THE NURSING PROGRAM SO WARMLY -- GIVE THEM ANY HARDSHIP. NO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM EVERYONE IN SUPPORT IS WERE ALLOWING EACH OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- TO MOVE ALONG THIS PATH AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING THEY'RE CONTINUING TO MOVE THAT WAY THE PROGRAM STARTED WITH A FEW COMMUNITY COLLEGES IT'S GROWN TO FORTY TWO NOW. AND WE'RE HOPING IT'LL GO -- THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE. DROWNED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING WE DID NOT WANT TO MANDATE IT BUT WE WANTED ALLOW. THE FLEXIBILITY FOR THOSE SMALLER COMMUNITY COLLEGE JUST OF THAT TO DEVELOP THEIR AM CST PROGRAMS. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ADJUSTER LEVER CATION MISTER CHAIR -- UNDERSTAND THIS IS HAVE AN AYE AYE RECOMMENDATION IT DOES -- DOES OKAY ON BOTH SIDES ON BOTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH SUPPORT SUPPORT.

AND DUAL ENROLLMENT DOES THAT FOR STUDENTS VERY MUCH. FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I'M GLAD YOU HAVE. AND WITH THAT -- WILL CALL THE ROLL I HAVE A QUESTION BEFORE. BOARDING ALL RIGHT. IS TO HOLD ON I HAVE A QUESTION I OBVIOUS TO SUPPORT THAT BECAUSE I A US -- NUMBER OF THE PLO. I KNOW OUR IRVINE VALLEY COLLEGE COMMITTEE COLLEGES IN US IN IRVINE. THEY HAVE A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE A PARTICULAR ATTACKMAN HIGH SCHOOL. OF FOR THE DOOR ENROLLMENT. AND THEN I A WASN'T QUITE SURE WHY -- A A AT THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE OPENED UP BUT AND THE WHAT DEVELOPED A RELATIONSHIP BUT TO RECEIVE THE STUDENTS OF FROM ONE PARTICULAR HIGH SCHOOL. WHERE YOU WILL BE -- ALLOW ANY YOU CAN APPLY FOR TO WORK IN ONE MONTH OUT OF THE CHOICE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO WITHOUT. HAVING. TO RELY UPON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COLLEGES DISTRICT COURT AND HIGH SCHOOL DEVELOPER THAT KIND OF AGREEMENT. IT. OF AND THAT THERE'S A PROBABLY MORE SPECIFIC TARGETED ANSWER THAT I'M GOING TO TURN TO OUR WHATEVER'S RESPONSES. TO ELABORATE ON BUT CANCERS YES IN TERMS OF IT BEING A VERY. ALL OF THE THE THE COLLEGES WITH THE COLLEGE IN THE DISTRICT. THAT THOSE STUDENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO ATTEND. IN THEIR DISTRICT OF THAT WOULD GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY EXPOSURE TO A DUAL ROLE IN AND THEN THE AGREEMENTS WOULD BE BETWEEN. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND IN THAT AREA AND WITH THE THE A K. THROUGH. TWELVE THE SCHOOL TO SO THEY HAVE THEIR AGREEMENTS AND THEY WOULD. DETERMINE -- LOCATION SUBJECT MATTER INSTRUCTORS. THAT OF SUBJECTS WOULD BE TAUGHT AND THOSE KIDS WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY NOW IF THAT COMMITTEE COLLEGE HAS A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP THAT'S SEPARATE FROM. FROM THIS BILL OKAY BASICALLY MY QUESTION IS -- ASSIST SHARON -- OF THEIR CHOICE HELP WALK FORCES. ALL RATHER THAN BEING BOUND. FIVE WHICH COLLEGES. WE'RE OCT SEPT. A CERTAIN HIGH SCORES AND THEN ALSO ONLY CERTAIN COURSES. BUT ARE I WOULD RATHER -- WOULD LIKE TO SEE. JUST A 100% FREEDOM. FOR STUDENTS SO THEY CAN NOT. OF CHOOSE THEIR COLLEGE FORCE AND THEY WANNA TAKE. SO THE THIS BILL IS ADDRESSING ONE TYPE OF DOING MOMENT OPTIONS AT THE WHICH IS DAY COLLEGE AND CAREER ACCESS PATHWAYS. WHICH PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK UNDER WHICH COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN PARTNER -- ON A SET OF COURSES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO STREAMLINE AND MAKE IT FASTER FOR STUDENTS TO GET THROUGH -- IT VERY SPECIFIC CLASSES THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO BE READY FOR COLLEGE AND EVENTUALLY STORY AND THE LACK OF THAT KIND OF A CONTRACT WHAT WE LOCATION SHIP BUT THEN THOSE CHILDREN SO EVEN IF THEY DESIRE. TO ENROLL MORE BENEFITING FROM THIS BILL NOT WILL NOT HAVE AN OPTION TO LITERATURE YEAH ANOTHER TYPE OF DOING MOMENT THAT DOES EXIST IS ONE THAT -- IS -- JUST AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS TO SELECT A COLLEGE TO ATTEND THAT DOES HAVE A CAP ON HOW MANY STUDENTS CAN PARTICIPATE IN THAT. BUT IT DOES PROVIDE THE FREEDOM THAT YOU'RE REFERRING -- TO IF THAT SOMETHING THAT IS OF INTEREST -- THIS IS STREAMLINED AND IT'S NEED MOST IN ORDER TO BE READY AND PREPARED -- AND AND A COST EFFECTIVE WAY FOR THEM TO START WORKING TOWARDS TRANSFERRED DEGREES. SOUTH. AND I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH MORE DETAILS ARE VERY SPECIFIC TO THE CASE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE MY SECOND QUESTION IS SO WHAT -- ORALLY -- THE AGREEMENT THE DETERMINE HOW MANY -- CREDIT HOUR LIMITATION WAGES JORDAN. YEAR WALK BY SOME BUS MASTER THEY CAN TAKE GOAL OR IS SET UP TO THE STUDENT. AT SO I UNDER CALLED IN CRACKS PATHWAYS STUDENT CAN TAKE UP TO FIFTEEN UNITS. I PER SEMESTER. WHICH IS JUST ABOVE THE FULL TIME LOAD YEAH. UNDER THIS UNDER THIS PROGRAM YOU HAVE I MEAN IT'S VERY UNIQUE YOU'VE CREATED A COLLEGE GOING CULTURE WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES AND YOU ALSO HAVE STUDENTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY. GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL WITH A A DEGREES. AS WELL I UNDERSTAND NOW OKAY MY QUESTION WAS THE WET WET -- THAT THE CREDIT LIMITATION. IS -- SET BY THE MONTEL WHY IS SET UP TO INDIVIDUAL STUDENT. YES -- UNDER C. CAPITA AT FIFTEEN UNITS -- SO THAT BECAUSE THE STUDENTS ARE ARE ARE ALSO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS -- AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT RESEARCH HAS SHOWN REALLY WORKS IS THE IN TERMS OF THE BALANCE THANK YOU. WE HAD A MOTION BY. DOCTOR CHOI SECOND BY DOCTOR RUMBULA -- MADAM SECRETARY IF YOU WOULD PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. MEDINA. MEDINA AYE CHOI HI CHOI I ARAMBULA. ARAMBULA I BLOOM. BLOOM I GABRIEL. GABRIEL I IRWIN. IRWIN I HIGHLY. KILEY I LEVINE. LEVINE I LOW. LOW I PATTERSON. SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO I WEBER [inaudible] WEBER I ELEVEN ZERO THE BILL IS OUT. THEIR ADDRESS ROBERT THANK YOU COMMITTEE WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ANY AB MEMBERS. THE NEXT BILL AB ONE FORTY MISS CERVANTES. WELCOME IS WOULD WANT THIS. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AB ONE FORTY TODAY THIS BILL IS A RE INTRODUCTION OF AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY SEVEN WHICH THIS COMMITTEE APPROVED LAST YEAR. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE MADE VALUABLE INVESTMENTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION SEVERAL UNDERGRADUATES EACH YEAR RELY ON FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS TO ENROLL AND COMPLETE. COLLEGE YET IT IS BORN DISPROPORTIONATELY BY VULNERABLE GROUPS OF STUDENTS SUCH AS FIRST GENERATION HOW GRANT STUDENTS AFRICAN AMERICANS HISPANICS AND LATINOS GRADUATES. THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS IN DEBT FOR CALIFORNIA. FOR CALIFORNIA GRADUATE OUT OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGES 50% WHAT THE TOTAL DEBT AVERAGE A 220-007-0080 FIVE DOLLARS PER GRADUATE. STUDENT LOAN COMPANIES OFTEN PROVIDE SIX MONTHS GREAT GRACE PERIOD BEFORE THEY ARE REQUIRED TO REPAY BACK THEIR LOANS. HOWEVER DATA SHOWS THAT SIX MONTHS IS GENERALLY NOT ENOUGH TIME FOR MANY STUDENTS WHO ARE LOOKING AT TRANSITION INTO THE WORK FORCE AND HAVE CHALLENGES. IN THE NEEDED JUST TO POST GRADUATE LIFE IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT TUITION FREE AND DEBT FREE ARE NOT SYNONYMOUS AND STUDENT DEBT. SHOULD REMAIN A CONCERN THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE MUST ADDRESS. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE INSUFFICIENT TIME STUDENTS HAVE TO CONSIDER CAREER OPTIONS AND HINDERS EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES WHAT STAGGERING STUDENTS. ABILITY TO EXPERIENCED ABILITY AND MAJOR LIFE EVENTS AB ONE FORTY WILL PROVIDE TWO YEARS A DEBT RELIEF FOR A FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN. TO RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATE WHO MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA. THIS PROGRAM IS ALREADY BE ADMINISTERED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB ONE FORTY WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS CHAIRED JURIES JERRY SO FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION. AND MELISSA BESET BY A STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MERCED -- AGO BIRTH. GOOD AFTERNOON -- CAN EVEN MEMBERS AND GERMANY NOW MY NAME IS SURGERY SO THAT THE I'M THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR GOVERNMENT. SORRY X. SIX AS SYSTEM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIPHATE'S IN ASSOCIATION. FIRST ONE OF THESE FOR THE YEAR -- WHICH REPRESENTS NEARLY HALF A MILLION CSU STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE. I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES FOR A IN THE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES FACING CSU STUDENTS WITH AB. ONE FORTY WELL THE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES FACING TODAY'S COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE DIVERSE AND DEEP -- TUITION IS RELATIVELY LOW IN THE CSU -- BUT ONLY 22% OF THE TOTAL COST OF COLLEGE IS TUITION IN THE CSU. THIS IS WHITE STUDENTS TODAY AREN'T JUST STRUGGLING TO GET A GOOD GRADE ON A MID TERM BUT ALSO STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE BILL PAY THE RENT WITH BEING HOMELESS. FIGURING OUT HOW THE FEED THEMSELVES ON A REGULAR BASIS WITH FORTY OVER 40% OF OUR STUDENTS STRUGGLING TO FEED THEMSELVES. THIS IS THE THESE ARE THE REASONS THAT COLLEGE STUDENTS ACROSS SEGMENTS THE CALIFORNIA CALLING ON THE LEGISLATURE AND HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS TO FIX OUR FOR ARE BROKEN FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM. HOWEVER AT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED WHILE WE ARE WORKING TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS IN THE CURRENT FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM WE MUST ALSO ADDRESS THE CURRENT CRISIS THE STUDENT LOAN DEBT -- WHICH THE CALIFORNIA KICKSTART MY FUTURE LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM SEEKS TO DO. THE GROWTH IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT TODAY UNDERSCORES THE DIRE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES FACING TODAY'S COLLEGE STUDENTS -- WHICH ARE UNIQUE -- WHICH ARE UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACING TODAY STUDENTS -- UNIQUELY. A FEW THERE IS A APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT -- NATIONALLY WHICH IS LARGER THAN ALL AUTO LOAN DEBT AS WELL AS ON LARGER THAN ALL CREDIT CARD DEBT. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS STUDENT LOAN DEBT HAS TRIPLED ON TO ITS CURRENT AMOUNT. AND FINALLY -- IT SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE LEAD THE NATION AND SOON LEARNED THAT WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS AMONGST APPROXIMATELY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION BORROWERS. NOT ONLY IS THE TOTAL LOAN -- DEBT AN IMPORTANT FIGURE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BUT WHO WHO HOLDS THE DEBT IN CALIFORNIA IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND -- AND AGAIN AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED THIS IS REFLECTED AND THAT BURDENS THAT FALL MORE HEAVILY ON UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS IN THE SET -- IN THE SEE IT CSU AS WELL AS LOW INCOME STUDENTS. ARE ORG ALONG WITH -- THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS PUBLISHED REPORT IN THE WINTER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHICH INVESTIGATED THIS ISSUE -- OF WHO HOLDS DEBT IN THE CSU. IT FOUND THAT SIX IN TEN STUDENTS WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE WHO BORROWED HAD COME FROM FAMILIES OF INCOMES NO GREATER THAN TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR ANNUALLY. ADDITIONALLY -- WHILE FIFTY BIRDS ARE HOW SPENDING A LOT ROGER IT'S AT 57% AND BLOCKING OUT AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS AT 76% HOLDING DOT. EVEN THOUGH THE AVERAGE -- DEBT FOR CSU STUDENTS IS BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE THIS REPORT SHOWS THAT WHO HOLDS THAT THAT IS THE THE GREATER CHALLENGE THAT WE MUST. ADDRESS AGAIN LASTLY THE RESEARCH ALSO DONE BY TAKE A SHOW THAT FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS PAL RECIPIENTS AN UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS ALL SHOWED HIGHER RATES OF STUDENT LOAN DEFAULT. FOR THESE REASONS A PROGRAM LIKE THE ONE CREATED BY A BEFORE -- ONE FORTY IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO GIVE STUDENTS A BIT OF FINANCIAL RELIEF WHILE THEY ESTABLISH THEIR CAREERS AND HELP THEM BETTER MANAGE THEIR LOAN DEBT AS THEY ULTIMATELY ARE ON THE ROAD TO FULLY PAY OFF THEIR LOANS -- WE ARE YOUR YESVOTE ON AB ONE FORTY TODAY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEDINA AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS MELISSA THE SERRA AND I'M A FOURTH YEAR PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR AT UC MERCED AND THE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AID WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA STUDENT ASSOCIATION. WHICH REPRESENTS TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND STUDENTS OF THE UC SYSTEM AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES FOR ALLOWING US TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB. ONE FORTY AB ONE FORTY IS IMPORTANT TO ME AND TO USE THE ESSAY BECAUSE IT ENSURES THAT FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE STUDENT BORROWERS ARE NOT HINDERED BY STUDENT LOANS. AND HAVE THE RESOURCES TO SUCCEED AND THE POST GRADUATE LIFE THE COST OF ATTENDING COLLEGE IS MORE THAN TUITION ALONE AS IT INCLUDES COSTS FOR FOOD AND HOUSING. 44% OF YOU SEE UNDERGRADUATES ARE FACING FOOD AND SECURITY AND THESE COSTS CAN LEAD STUDENTS TO TAKE OUT STUDENT LOANS. ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT THE FACTS FROM STUDENT DEBT AT THE UC. NEARLY THREE OUT OF EVERY FIVE YOU SEE STUDENTS GRADUATE WITH SOME LEVELS OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT. THE AVERAGE STUDENT LOAN DEBT AT THE UC DOLLARS. MOST CONCERNING BELOW IS CAN THE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS AT THE UC GRADUATE WITH THE MOST AMOUNT AT THAT AT TIMES WOULD NEARLY DOUBLE OR TRIPLE. THE AMOUNT OF DEBT THAN THAT OF THE HIGHER INCOME COUNTERPARTS. CITY LET STUDENT LOAN DEBT ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS BAR WAS OF COLOR. AT MY CAMPUS UC MERCED WHICH IS A HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTION WERE NEARLY THREE FOURTHS OF THE STUDENTS ARE FIRST GENERATION. AND THREE FIFTHS OF WHOM ARE POWER RECIPIENTS OVER 70% OF STUDENTS GRADUATE WITH THAT WHICH IS A STAGGERING NUMBER AND I BELIEVE THAT AB ONE FORTY WILL HELP THE BEST HELP SUPPORT. THE STUDENTS WHO ARE FACING LOANS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. RON WRAPPING UP IN CALIFORNIA WE HAD ORIGINALLY TEACHERS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU FATHER FOR PROVIDING LEADERSHIP ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE WITH THE BILL CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIR OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER SOMEONE TENNIS A OF UNDERSTAND. THE INTENT OF YOUR P. L. HELPING -- SHOULDN'T IS. ALLEVIATE THE THEIR BURDEN. WHEN THEY GRADUATE THE? I'M COLLEGES SO. WITH THE SCORE DEBT [inaudible] BUT THE INCOME DRIVEN REPAYMENT PLAN -- IS A DESIGNED TO MAKE US SUCH A DANCE STUDENT LOAN -- MANAGEABLE BY REDUCING THE BARREL IS SAW. A PAYMENT AMOUNT -- AS MUCH AS A IN ALL. TACK DURING ALL THEY ARE CIRCUMSTANCES -- AND THAT ALLOWING PAYMENTS TO COLE S. ROY IS A ZERO DOLLARS. AND THE OVER THE PERIOD. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THEY ARE ALL SOUL MANY KINDS OF LAW -- AS CHILDREN SCHOLARSHIPS AND LOAN PROGRAM SO -- TO A FOR THEM TO GRADUATE. NOW WHEN THEY GRADUATE. THEY ARE EQUIPPED. TO GET A JOB IN THE IT FIELD. I'M VERY CURIOUS. YOU MENTIONED FIRST GENERATION. IMMIGRANTS WHICH I AM. AND MINORITY PEOPLE WALK OUT OF THE PEOPLE. WILL HAVE MORE LIKELY -- TO HAVE -- OF MORE DEBT SO THAT ORDER. AND THIS ONE YOU'LL BE IT IS A LIMITING WHEN THE STUDENTS SO -- INCOME IS TO LESS THAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- THEN THEY WOULD BE YOU ARE ELIGIBLE. I'M I'M CURIOUS. WITH THE STATE -- SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION TO WALK RIGHT TO IT. WE'RE LIKELY END UP BUT WITH THE SUCH ALERT LOW PAID JOBS NO WHY. AT THAT WOULD BE MY FIRST QUESTION AND THEN I HAVE SOME SIMPLE QUESTIONS. WELL AS WE KNOW I DIFFERENT PARTS OF OUR STATES ARE DOING BETTER THAN OTHERS AND IT'S A REGIONAL ISSUE AS WELL SO DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO COLLEGE. HOW WERE YOU GRADUATES AND A LOT OF STUDENTS HAVE TO LOOK FOR FOR WORK? OUTSIDE OF THEIR AREA THAT THEY GRADUATED AND AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING YEAR AFTER YEAR WITH GRADUATES -- BUT THE OVERALL ISSUE IS CONCERNING. ARE GROWING CRISIS IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. STUDENT LOANS ARE THE SECOND LARGEST CONSUMER DEBT SEGMENT AND HAVE SURPASSED HOME EQUITY. A REVOLVING DEBT AUTO LOANS AND CREDIT CARD DEBT BALANCES SHORTLY AFTER THE RECESSION. AND SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I BELIEVE WE AS A LEGISLATURE MUST LEAN AND ON AND ADDRESS. AND WE MUST TO DO THIS BY PASSED SEED POLICIES I THAT ADDRESSES VERY ISSUE. I WILL THOUGH TURN IT OVER -- TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY SHOULD THEY WANT TO ADD ON I MEAN I I WOULD REITERATE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS COMMENTS I'D SAY THAT SEEING THE THE THE GROWTH IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST TEN YEARS AND SING AT TRIPLE I THINK UNDERSCORES. HOW BIG OF A CRISIS THIS IS AGAIN IN THE CSU IT AS YOU WOULD ASSUME WITH A LOW TUITION RATE AND THE FACT THAT MANY OF OUR STUDENTS DON'T PAY TUITION THAT IT WOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE BUT? AFFORDING THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE AND BEING ABLE TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA WHILE PURSUING A DEGREE HAS BEEN A UNIQUE CHALLENGE TODAY IN A WAY THAT IT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS AGO JUST SEEING THAT GROWTH AND STUDENT LOAN DEBT. YOU KNOW MY QUESTION WAS -- STILL RUNS OUT NOT. ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS TO RINSE OUT GRADUATING WITH IT -- WITH THE TUITION DEBTS. YUP COLLEGES ARE EXPENSIVE. AND MY A MY TWO MAJOR QUESTIONS WORLD WHY CERTAIN SECTORS OF THE POPULATION [inaudible] ON A ARE STRUGGLING IN A PAYING. AND WITH THE SAME EQUAL OR DEGREE SO WHEN THEY GRADUATE WE ADOPT OUR LOAN FORGIVENESS A PROGRAM. NOT A SCHOLARSHIP NUMBER -- TWO WAS THAT THE ALREADY. INCOME DRIVEN NOT A REPAYMENT PLAN -- ALLOWS -- TO BEFORE THE INDIVIDUALS HEY. THIS SO YOU'RE AFTER YEAR. HALL. ALLOWING THEIR LIVING EXPENSES. A AND THEN ONE OF THE COMFORTABLE AMOUNT OF AND SO -- NOW STATE THAT COMES IN. AS MUCH AS OF FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. WE WE WE TRY TO PROVIDE AS MUCH SCHOLARSHIP ORDER THE LOAN. AND THEN I'VE I THINK THIS SHOULD BE. OF MORE ENCOURAGING FOR THEM TO GET A JOB AND ENCOURAGING -- BUT THE EMPLOYERS TO PAY -- RESPECTABLE. A SALARY WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE A MAJORITY WOULD BE -- UNDERGRADUATE THE CHILDREN. OF GRADUATES TO WE ARE SPEAKING ABOUT THE AND THE MOST CASES OUT OF THE B. K. R.. O. DIDN'T DISSIPATE THE THEIR BASIC SALARY PROBABLY MINIMUM THRESHOLD DOSE. THOUSAND DOLLARS BELOW. HERE. BUT THE WHY IS CERTAIN. GROUP BOB POPULATION THAT YOU MENTIONED. THEY THEY THEY ARE. UP. MORE SUFFERING FROM THIS -- THEY NEED A LEG UP. I'LL EXPLAIN MY SITUATION FOR EXAMPLE -- YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS GROWING UP -- MY PARENTS HAVE COME HERE TO THIS COUNTRY THEN HOW MUCH -- MONEY -- DO KNOW THE EDUCATION -- BUT I'M IS GET THROUGH SCHOOL SYSTEM -- I WENT TO UCLA -- WE HAD I HAD TO TAKE A LOAN. PLAIN AND SIMPLE BUT I ALSO HAD TO HELP -- WITH FAMILY INCOME BECAUSE IT WASN'T ENOUGH -- OFF MY PARENTS A MINIMUM WAGE -- TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR RENT AS DID MY BROTHER -- BUT I THINK THE THE THESE THE SIMPLE ANSWER IS -- THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. IT'S IT'S A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT. AND I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM WITH PASSED A BILL THAT HELPS US WITHIN TWENTY COMES THE DEBT BECAUSE IT IS THE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES. FACING THIS COUNTRY -- BUT I DO WANT TO STICK TO THE QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING I. I'LL AND ANSWER FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE -- HOUSE POOR PEOPLE CHOOSE THE POOR -- YOU KNOW THIS IS A NO DIFFERENT THAN THE YOU KNOW YOU YOU WOULD CHOOSE TO BE A TO HAVE SCHOOL LOANS AND YES I DID WORK I WORK FULL TIME -- AND I WHEN I WAS GOING TO UCLA MOST OF THE TIME -- BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH TO MAKE BILLS -- IT WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE THE BILLS SO I HAD TO TAKE LOANS AND YES I DID TAKE FINANCIAL AID -- BUT I DON'T REMEMBER THE NUMBERS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD THE CHAIR CAN CORRECT ME. BUT IT'S GOT TO BE ABOUT WHAT IS IT THIRTY TWO THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR -- FOR STUDENT GOING TO UC SYSTEM AND IT'S A WAS A TWENTY FOUR TWENTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS -- THE GO TO THE CSU SYSTEM FOOT THAT'S PRETTY EXPENSIVE -- AND IF YOU COME FROM A WORKING FAMILY AGAIN OF THE STATE YOU JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY YOUR POOR. IT ADDS UP AND SO -- THERE'S A REASON WHY PEOPLE GET LOANS. AND AND AND I'M ALSO FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE ALL THE THINGS THAT A LONG CAN PROVIDE -- AFTERWARDS RIGHT YOU CAN DIFFER YOU CAN GET CERTAIN THINGS BUT THE BASIC ANSWERS. PEOPLE POOR OR THE CAN. FOR MY GO BACK TO THE OTHER BIG. WHAT A COMMON ANSWER ABSOLUTELY THIS IS A STORY THAT WE HEAR ACROSS THE STATE WHEN STUDENTS COME TO OUR OFFICES IN THE CAPITAL IN THE DISTRICT OFFICE TO SHARE WITH US WHAT THEIR GREATEST BURDENS ARE? AND AS A LEGISLATOR IS MY RESPONSIBILITY. TO TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WHICH IS WHY THIS BILL IS BEFORE YOU TODAY. THANK YOU. YEAH JUST A FOR YOUR INFORMATION TO FORMAL ONE PIECE OF INFORMATION I'LL BE INTRODUCING AB -- THREE FIFTY TO ENCOURAGE. ALL THE PARENTS SO OUR RELATIVE SO IT Y. E. IL OR OUT. ANY EVEN COMPANIES. TO ANY. IN ALL YOUNGSTERS TO SAVE MONEY CAUGHT THE IRS OF FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN. AND A CALIFORNIA IS STILL ONE THE ONE OF THE FEW -- STAY SO WHICH DOES NOT TEXTED DEDUCTION -- EVEN THOUGH THE GROWTH OF THE FUND -- IS NOT GONNA BE TAXABLE WRESTLING SAID THAT THE AMOUNT THIS USED. TO FOR EDUCATION PURPOSES SO WHEN THEY GO TO COLLEGE. SO WHAT ARE BE INTRODUCING -- A MORE SAVINGS PLAN AND THE ENCOURAGING PARENTS TO PARTICIPATE THE SO THAT THE BURDEN WOULD BE NOT TO THE GOVERNMENT UP BUT THE ENCOURAGING. UP PARENTS SO OF THE TO STOP EARLY AND THE GOVERNMENT IS -- INCENTIVIZING. THAT THE IF I SAVE A ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS TODAY. AT THE END THAT THE PORTION OF WOULD BE TAX CREDIT A TAX -- DEDUCTIBLE SO AS AN ENCOURAGEMENT. SO. I I AM MORE IN IN IN THAT -- OF PROVIDING A SCHOLARSHIP SO EARLY ON AND I ONCE YOU GRADUATE. YOU HAVE ALREADY VOTING POWER RATHER THAN. COUPLE MONTHS UNTIL YOU DIE WE IF SO. WHAT THE GRADUATE IF I WOULD HAVE A AND I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED? NOT SEEN ANYWHERE QUESTIONS RESERVE WANT THIS -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. WHAT IT THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IN -- THE BILL FORD I ATE A AGREE WITH YOU THE AMOUNT OF DEBT THAT STUDENTS HAVE. AFTER GRADUATION FROM COLLEGE -- IS PRESENTING MANY CHALLENGES TO THEM -- AMONG THEM -- THE ABILITY TO BUY A NEW HOUSE AND PURSUE THE AMERICAN DREAM.
