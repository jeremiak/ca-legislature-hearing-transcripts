INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT ALSO PROVIDE VIDEO FRANCHISE SERVICE TO REPORT VERY SPECIFIC TYPES OF BUSINESS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. FIRST OF ALL AS I INDICATED THAT THE ONLY APPLIES TO ONE TYPE OF THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER IN SO IT IS NOT TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AS WE UNDERSTAND IT SENATORS AND CAN'T BE INFORMATION IS TO BE REPORTED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHERE BROADBAND FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN THIS SERVICE. IS ACTUALLY AVAILABLE. THE END. THAT SECTION TWELVE WOULD BE THE INDUSTRY TO REPORT HOWEVER IS INCONSISTENT IMPART AND DUPLICATIVE IN PART OF INFORMATION THAT THE INDUSTRY IS BEING REQUIRED TO REPORT TO THE FEC PERSPECTIVE THE BROADBAND DATA ACT FOR PURPOSES OF BROADBAND MAPPING. WE HAVE REQUESTED AMENDMENTS- AND FOR THE SENATORS CONSIDERATION AND AXAPTA COMMITTEE CONTENT CONSIDERED THE SAME. TO AMEND THE BILL TO ONLINE AND LYNETTE THE REPORTING OF INFORMATION TO THE C. P. U. C. TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THAT INFORMATION THAT IS BEING REPORTED TO THE SEC. PURSUANT TO THE BROADBAND DATA ACTING AND THAT THE REPORTING WHY TO ALL INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS ALL FACILITIES BASED INTERNET BROADBAND PROVIDERS EQUALLY- WE'D ALSO LIKE CLARIFICATION THAT ANY INFORMATION REPORTED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION WOULD IN FACT.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL NOW BREAK BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. SCOUTER SENATOR- OBVIOUSLY- BOTH OF US ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND ENSURING THAT WE EXPAND- ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET- IN OUR CONSTITUENCIES- TO THE TO THE POINT OF THE OPPOSITION THAT THIS IS KIND OF TARGETED MORE TOWARDS THE VIDEO SERVICE PROVIDERS AND DOESN'T NECESSARILY INCLUDE YOU KNOW ALL THESE OTHERS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE SAME. ISSUE YOU KNOW TELECOMMUNICATIONS- I MEAN WHERE YOU HAD SOME OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS IN TERMS OF MAY MAKING AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AND ALSO- KIND OF MAKING IT SIMILAR TO WHAT THE WAY THAT THEY REPORT TO THE FEC. FCC WOULD BE- HOW THEY WOULD REPORT TO THE PC. WE'RE JUST GONNA JUMP IN FOR ONE MOMENT- SENATORS SO- ALL ALL I TO ANSWER IF YOU WANT JUST TO JUST TO POINT OUT YOU KNOW WE ARE WE HAVE A VERY NARROW SLICE OF THIS BILL THAT'S WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THIS COMMITTEE AND SO THOSE ISSUES WERE- YOU KNOW DEBATED ROBUSTLY AND YOU KNOW PRIOR COMMITTEE AND SO I JUST WANNA GIVE YOU DON'T. YOU SHOULD FEEL FREE TO RESPOND IF YOU CAN BUT THE WHAT WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON TODAY IS A VERY STE NERO SLICE OF THIS BILL IS A RESIDENT AT DEALS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY NOW TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT IS. FOR MY PURPOSES AND OBVIOUSLY KAREN ABOUT THE ISSUE AND HAVE AND NOT HAVING BEEN IN THAT COMMITTEE I JUST WANT TO GET SOME INFO. AT THAT NUMBER BOTH THAT THE COMMON IN THAT THE- THE ISSUE BOB LET ME JUST SAY THAT- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT THEIR REGULATION THERE REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND THE SEPARATION BETWEEN WHAT THE STATE CAN REGULATE AND WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN REGULATE. THEY REGULATE THAT THE INTERNET- AND- UNTIL THEY MAKE THE DECISION THAT IT'S NOT JUST AN ENTERTAINMENT- INTO- REGULATORY PROCESS UNTIL THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A- IS MUCH MUCH. MORE IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMY AND IT'S AT COMMERCE ISSUE- WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO REGULATE THOSE ENTITIES THAT ARE JUST PROVIDING INTERNET SERVICES WHAT WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO REGULATE. IS THE ART THE VIDEO- THE VIDEO SERVICES AND SO- THE REASON WE CAN GET INTO LOOKING AT WHERE THE SERVICE IS BEEN PROVIDED QUITE FRANKLY. IS THIS PANDEMIC HAS AT SENDING US ALL HOME AND THEN REQUIRING. EDUCATION TO HAPPEN THROUGH THE INTERNET REALLY. HIGHLIGHTED THE FACT THAT OUR SERVICES ARE NOT. EQUALLY. OR- RIGHT IN EVERYTHING COMMUNITY AND OP LIKE IT SHOULD BE SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF ISSUES RELATED TO HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THERE- THAT I WON'T GO INTO BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WHAT WE CAN REGULATE. IT IS THE VIDEO SERVICES AND WE KNOW WHERE THOSE ARE LOCATED- BASED ON THE BUNDLING THAT'S BEEN DONE. WITH WITH THE PACKAGES THAT ALSO PROVIDE INTERNET INTERNET SERVICES SO. WHAT PART OF THE CHALLENGE WITH HOW. INFORMATION IS REPORTED TO THE CPSC. IS THAT IT'S DONE AS A SERVICE AREA SO A COMPANY COMES IN THIS IS I'M GONNA PROVIDE SERVICE TO THIS AREA. I'M ON I DIDN'T BRING MY MAPS BECAUSE THIS IS THAT'S NOT THE SUBJECT AREA OF THIS- COMMITTEE BUT I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHOW YOU. IF WE WITH SOME REAL SPECIFIC DATA WHAT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN. WHAT THE- COMPANY SAY THEY'RE PROVIDING IN A SERVICE AREA AND THEN. WELL THE INFORMATION WHEN YOU COMPARE IT TO WITH THE SEC IS GETTING. ON ON IT LOOKS LIKE SWISS SWISS CHEESE IS WHAT IT AMOUNTS TO. THESE COMPANIES. THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN IT AS PART OF THE P. C. P. C- HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THEY WERE GIVEN A VERY VALUABLE FRANCHISE. AND THE FRANCHISE TOOK AWAY THE ABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TO HAVE A SAY IN HOW BAD VIDEO CONFERENCING SERVICES IT WAS DEPLOYED I REMEMBER BECAUSE I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL THEY HAD TO NEGOTIATE WITH US. AND AND INSTEAD THEY GOT A STATE WIDE FRANCHISE AND THE AGREEMENT THEY MADE AT THE TIME WAS THEY WOULDN'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY. AND SO THE C. P. U. C. IS RENEWING THEIR FRANCHISE AGREEMENT AND YET THEY'RE THEY'RE BEING GIVEN DATED THAT IS. NOT DOES NOT GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO KNOW WHETHER THERE THERE'S COMMUNITIES BE DISCRIMINATE OR NOT. SO THIS BILL PUTS LOCAL GOVERNMENT BACK AT THE TABLE DURING THOSE THOSE REVIEWS OF THE OF THE LICENSING. SO MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO- REGULATE ALL OF THE COMPANIES WE JUST DON'T HAVE THAT AUTHORITY. CURRENT LAW IN- IN TERMS OF FEDERAL PREEMPTION SO YEAH AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BY VIRTUE OF. JUST THE WAY THINGS ARE AND THE WAY THINGS ARE SET UP- ME ABOUT TO THE STATE LEVEL AND FEDERAL LEVEL- THE WAY THAT WE REGULATE THINGS. I GUESS THE ISSUE IS THAT. ALL THESE PLAYERS ARE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND HAVE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. AND IN FACT I MEAN NOW I MEAN IT I THINK IT'S EVEN BEEN EXPANDED YOU KNOW WITH THEM. YOU KNOW THE- STARLIGHT TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT ON- NEARBY. YOU KNOW I MUST COMPANY THAT HE STARTED. IT MAY BE THAT WE YOU KNOW THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY GET HIGHER SPEEDS THERE IS AN ARTICLE RECENTLY THAT- IN TAMA COUNTY WHICH I REPRESENT- THIS IS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE INTERNET SPEEDS BY OVER 510050% AT WHICH WOULD BE HUGE RIGHT AND SO MAYBE IT'S NOT A FIBER OPTION YOU KNOW A LOT OF THESE COMPANIES ARE. THERE IN THE FIBER WORLD RIGHT. AND YEAH BUT YOU TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND NEW TO AND WIRELESS AND OTHER. ENTITIES THAT ARE REALLY PART OF THIS I FEEL LIKE IT'S KIND OF. WE'RE ONLY FOCUSING ON ONE PART WHEN THERE'S A BIGGER PICTURE HERE YOU KNOW SO THAT'S WHY. ONE OF MY CONCERNS I GUESS GOING FORWARD AND FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE CRACKED THAT NUT IF YOU WILL- UNDERSTOOD- AND THEN ONE OTHER ISSUES FROM THE LOCALS WHICH IS YOU KNOW BECAUSE THIS IS ADDITIONAL COST IN THE WAY THAT FRANCHISE FEES WORK IS THIS COULD GET COME INTO JUST THE OVERALL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCREASES IN THEIR ONLY OBLIGATED TO GIVE SO MUCH. IT COULD IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY REVENUE THAT GOES BACK TO. HIS PC TAKES A CHUNK OFF THE TOP OF THAT. RIGHT IF THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE MORE BECAUSE OF THIS YOU KNOW. THE PROVISIONS THIS BILL IS THAT LESS MONEY THAT'S GOING TO GO BACK TO. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. I DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANY ISSUE OF REACHING FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAT. THAT EITHER CHANGED IN THIS BILL OR THAT ARE. PROPOSED TO BE CHANGE IN THIS BILL OKAY. THANK YOU MR GALLAGHER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. JUST MAKE A COMMENT THAT I JUST APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF TRYING TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN I REALIZED IT TOOK SOME CREATIVITY AND DEAL WITH THE LEGAL CHALLENGES EXETER- BUT- WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THERE'S A REAL NEED SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR FOR. PUSHING THANK YOU SIR APPRECIATE THAT. ALL RIGHT SEE NOTE NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I WANT TO. JUST CLARIFY WITH THE AUTHOR JUST TO MAKE SURE CLEAR YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE- THE- MMS IN THE ANALYSIS IS THAT CORRECT CORRECT OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THE BALLOT FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THE AMENDMENTS- IN APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE THIS IS A- CRITICAL ISSUE THE IMPORTANCE OF WHICH HAS ONLY BEEN HIGHLIGHTED DURING THE PANDEMIC WHICH YOU AND I DISCUSSED. AND WE KNOW THAT THIS IS ONE OF MANY BROADBAND BILLS THAT ARE MOVING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW AND I THINK YOUR BILL IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT BROADER CONVERSATION. YOU KNOW OUR COMMITTEE TODAY'S CONSIDERING ONLY A VERY NARROW PART OF YOUR BILL- THE FALLS UNDER THE SPECIFIC SPECIFIC JURISDICTION OF THE COMMITTEE. AND ON THOSE ISSUES I BE I STRONGLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE LEVERAGED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AND WITH THAT I'M I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY SO THANK YOU FOR BEING A FORD. AND DIED YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU AND IT JUST KNOW THAT I CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY TO TRY TO GET IT RIGHT AND I THINK THE SECTION THAT WAS- CALLED OUT IS A SECTION THAT DEALS WITH THE ISSUES THAT THE COMMITTEE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT WE'VE AGREED TO TAKE AMENDMENTS.

ANY TIME THEIR DATA IS SHARED WITH A THIRD PARTY. AND CAN AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND DELETE THEIR DATA AT ANY TIME.

MISTER COLONEL AT THE PARTICIPANTS ARE QUEUED UP AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT THIS TIME WE WILL TURN TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ARE PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION IS CAMA DIMITRI FROM TECHCONNECT WHO WILL BE APPEARING BY PHONE. GOOD AFTERNOON SURE MEMBERS WHEN IT CAME TO BE TRIMMED EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIANS SOUTHWEST THE TECHNO. TECHNO THE NATIONAL BIPARTISAN NETWORK OF TECHNOLOGY CEOS AND SENIOR EXECUTIVES THAT PROMOTES THE GROWTH THE INNOVATION ECONOMY. AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. SB FORTY ONE INNER SEEKING TO AMENDMENTS AN EXCEPTION SECTION OF THE LANGUAGE. WELL WE UNDERSTAND THE GOAL DOCTORS TO PLACE IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS AROUND DIRECT TO CONSUMER GENETIC TESTING DATA. GIVE A COUPLE OF OUTSTANDING CONCERNS. THE LATEST AMENDMENT STILL IN STILL BE NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE WE HAVE RAISED PREVIOUSLY WHICH IS THAT GENETIC DATA AS DEFINED IS TO BROADEN THAT INCLUDES ANY DATA DERIVED FROM RESULTS. WHICH IS WHY WE ARE SEEKING TO ADD OR CONDITION AN EXCEPTION SIX. DEFINITION IN CONJUNCTION WITH HOW BROADLY A DIRECT TO CONSUMER GENETIC TESTING DATA COMPANY IS ALSO DEFINED. IN THE EVEN A CASUAL CONVERSATION THE WORKPLACE RESULTING FROM THE TAX MONEY TAKEN OR ANY GENETIC PASSED WILL BE IN THE SCOPE OF THE BILL. IT'S CERTAINLY HELPFUL THAT THERE IS NO EXCLUSION. DISEASE IN THE LATE AMENDMENT BUTTON DEFINITION OF GENETIC DATA INCLUDES DATA RESULTING FROM. IT GOES BEYOND JUST THE PAST. GARCIA SECOND AMENDMENT HERE'S SOME SINNERS WHICH ELIMINATE WHY WE'RE SEEKING THE EXCEPTION OF ANY TO WORKPLACE SAFETY. AMPLE ONE EMPLOYER DECIDE THAT ALWAYS NEED TO HAVE A NEGATIVE COVER TEST RESULT TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS IN PERSON COVERED HAS RELY ON GENETIC DATA IN MIGHT RELY ON THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE CERTAIN PROTEINS OR OTHER MARKERS OF COVERAGE. RATHER THAN THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF THE VIRUS ITSELF. IT'LL TO EMPLOYER DECIDES TO ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO OPT INTO SPECIAL WORK ARRANGEMENTS I HI THE LOCATIONS AT THE MEASURE. THURMOND COMPROMISED UNABLE TO GET VACCINATED OR TAKE MEDICATION INTERFERES WITH THEIR ABILITY TO BUILD COMMUNITY SOME OF THESE EMPLOYEES MIGHT OPT AND BASED ON TEST RESULTS FROM BLOOD OR OTHER GENETIC DATA. PERHAPS IMPORTER WOULDN'T KNOW THE UNDERLYING REASON. BUT HOW WOULD THIS BILL LOOKS WOULD OFTEN DATA COLLECTED BY THE EMPLOYER. THE LAST EXAMPLE THE CDC DETERMINES THAT PREFIX VACCINATIONS NOT ENOUGH TO STOP THE SPREAD OF COVETING REQUIRES ANYBODY TESTING. OR NEGATIVE CODE ATTACHED AS WELL AS THE FOUR EMPLOYEES CAN GATHER IN GROUPS IS THE DON'T COVER FUTURE POSSIBILITIES EXPENSE. YOU FURTHER HOUSE HAS ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE WHICH STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF ENABLING EMPLOYERS TO BE ABLE TO USE. THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION. NAY RAISES CONCERNS WITH YOUR STAFF REPORTER CONVERSATIONS AGAIN WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU WE WILL NOW TURN TO ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN THE HEARING ROOM. SEEING NONE WE WILL GO TO THE REMOTE TESTIMONY LOCATION ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AT THE REMOTE TESTIMONY LOCATION. SEE NON LET'S GO TO THE PHONE LINES MISTER OPERATOR ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ON THE PHONES. THANK YOU RIGHT TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION FOR SB FOUR ONE PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO AT THIS TIME. WHEN FILED BY ZERO. MISTER CHAIR NOBODY IS QUEUING UP. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO AT THIS POINT LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS IN A MISTER CUNNINGHAM WAS EAGER TO ASK A QUESTION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND THIS QUESTION CAN BE ANSWERED BY THE SENATOR OR- OR ONE OF THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ACTUALLY TWO QUESTIONS- SUPPORT OF THE BILL I THINK IT'S GREAT BILL NEXT TIME WE DID IT. WE NEEDED IT FOR A LONG TIME- MY FIRST QUESTION MORE OF THE BASIC LEGAL QUESTION THAT I DIDN'T SEE ANSWERED IN AND ALSO IS. THE SAY I TAKE A GENETIC TESTS AND I SEND IT TO ANCESTRY OTHER. PROVIDER WHO WHO OWNS THE ROAD TEST RESULTS THEMSELVES LIKE WHO HAS TITLE TO THAT. I'VE JUST ALWAYS WONDERED THAT I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS CURIOUS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR THE QUESTION I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION EITHER PERHAPS- IF THERE IS A- ONE OF THE WITNESSES ON MIGHT BE ABLE TO RESPOND THAT WOULD BE GREAT. SO LET ME ASK. MR ENGELHARDT IF HE KNOWS THE ANSWER IF NOT WE CAN GET IT TOO. YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO THERE THERE'S NO TITLING PROCESS FOR GENETIC DATA- SO IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO A QUESTION OF WHO'S IN CONTROL OF THAT INFORMATION. AND EVERY STEP IN THE PROCESS THE CONSUMER HAS CONTROL IF THEY WANT TO DELETE THEIR DATA DESTROY THEIR BIOLOGICAL SAMPLE THEY CAN REQUEST THAT AND WE COMMIT IN WRITING TO DO THAT WITHIN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DAYS. AND WE DON'T USE THEIR DATA FOR ANY PURPOSE THAT WE HAVEN'T DISCLOSED UP FRONT OR THAT THEY HAVE NOT PROVIDED SEPARATE EXPRESS CONSENT FOR SO. WHILE WE MAY HAVE THEIR DATA AND USE IT FOR PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT AND TO FIGURE OUT. YOU KNOW WHAT GENES ARE AFFILIATED WITH CERTAIN ETHNICITIES OR WHAT NOT TO PROVIDE MORE ACCURATE ETHNICITY ESTIMATES. AT ALL TIMES THEY CAN TAKE THAT DATA OUT OF OUR SYSTEM CLOSE THEIR ACCOUNT HAVE EVERYTHING DELETED THEY'RE IN CONTROL. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER THAT'S VERY HELPFUL MY SECOND QUESTION IS- UNDER THIS BILL LET'S SAY I TAKE A TEST AND- IT COMES BACK IN THAT AND IT'S AND I DON'T HAVE BEEN DELETED AND YOUR FIRM ANOTHER FIRM HAS CUSTODY OF IT. CONTROL OF IT- AND THEN I WANT IT CONVEYED AT SOME POINT TO THE SAID DR BECAUSE I'M WORRIED I MAY HAVE PRECURSORS TO PARTICULAR TYPE OF- ILLNESS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I'D LIKE TO HAVE IT. TESTED MEDICALLY TO FIND THAT OUT IS THERE IS THERE ANYTHING THAT EITHER PROHIBITS OR AUTHORIZES OR ALLOWS THAT TYPE OF. SUBSEQUENT CONVEYANCE UNDER UNDER THIS BILL. SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUST TO CLARIFY YOUR QUESTION SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I WANT. SAY ANCESTRY TO COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH THE PHYSICIAN IS OUR MECHANISM TO DO THAT THAT YOUR QUESTION YEAH OURS ARE PROHIBITED FROM FOR ILLNESS IT UNDER I DON'T BELIEVE IS PROHIBITED BUT MR ANGLE HEARTS GOING TO CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. NO I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION SO EITHER INSISTING OR TWENTY THREE AND ME HAVE A PROCESS TO DIRECTLY COMMUNICATE A CONSUMERS GENETIC DATA TO A THIRD PARTY LIKE A PHYSICIAN- IF A CONSUMER WANTED TO DO THAT WHAT WE WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT THEY EITHER PRINT THE REPORTS OFF OF THE WEBSITE AND TAKE THOSE TO THEIR PHYSICIAN OR EMAIL THOSE TO THEIR PHYSICIAN. OR THEY CAN DOWNLOAD THEIR RAJIN ADDICT DATA THEMSELVES AND TRANSMIT THAT OVER TO THE PHYSICIAN NOW WE PROVIDE MANY WARNINGS ABOUT DOWNLOADING YOUR DATA BECAUSE ONCE IT'S OFF OUR SYSTEM. WE CAN'T PROTECT HOW IT'S TREATED ON YOUR LAPTOP OR ON EMAIL OR WHATNOT FROM FROM ANY OTHER INTERFERENCE BUT THEY DO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THAT THEMSELVES WE DO NOT DIRECTLY TRANSMIT THAT DATA TO MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS SO. OKAY THE- THAT SAYS. MY CONCERN THERE AND I THINK THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE THE- CUSTOMER USE OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT IS IN CONTROL OF THAT AND THEN CAN TAKE IT APPARENTLY TO A DOCTOR AND I THINK THERE'S SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL UTILITY FOR. PEOPLE IN THE HEALTH CARE FOR THAT BEING ABLE FOR THAT BEING A LOT. AND AS LONG AS THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT'S- GETTING IN THE WAY OF IT THAT SOUNDS LIKE. A PROBLEMS- NOT A PROBLEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M GLAD WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT YOUR SUPPORT. SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE VOTE FORWARD UP ONE QUESTION AND A COMMENT- SO DOES THIS IS APPLIED RETROACTIVELY TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE. ALREADY TAKEN THESE TESTS ARE JUST MOVING FORWARD OR BOTH IT. IT IS PROSPECTIVE OKAY- I LOVE THIS BILL AND I DO TWENTY THREE ME AND I'M SORT OF PSEUDO OBSESSED WITH ALL THIS KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU GET WHEN YOU- DO THESE TESTS SOME OF IT IS INTERESTING AND HELPFUL SOME OF IT'S A LITTLE RANDOM BUT- I THINK IT'S VERY FASCINATING I'M REALLY GLAD YOU'RE DOING IT. I LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS DATA IN PARTICULAR IS PROTECTED WITH THE UTMOST. OF PRIVACY CONCERNS OF THANK YOU FOR DOING THE BILL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORKS. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OKAY WELL SEEING NONE THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRING FOR THIS THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND THANK YOU FOR PERSON YOUR PERSISTENCE AND WORKING ON THIS ISSUEOVER THE PAST TWO YEARS- I THINK IT'S HARD TO THINK OF ANYTHING THAT'S MORE PERSONAL OR MORE REVEALING THAT OUR GENETIC INFORMATION AND THAT'S LIKELY TO BE EVEN MORE SO AS SCIENCE PROGRESSES IN OUR- UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN GENETICS INCREASES AND SO. WITH THE PROLIFERATION OF THESE DIRECT TO CONSUMER GENETIC TESTING COMPANIES IT'S CRITICAL THAT CONSUMERS ARE PROVIDED WITH APPROPRIATE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AND WE SURE THAT SUCH SENSITIVE INFORMATION IS PROTECTED FROM UNWANTED USES AND DISCLOSURES. AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE GIVEN THE CURRENT LIMITATIONS ON MEDICAL PRIVACY LAWS OUTSIDE OF THE HEALTH CARE CONTEXT I WANT TO. THANK YOU FOR OFFERING THIS BILL WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND WITH COMMITTEE STAFF TO CRAFT AN AMENDMENT- THAT ADDRESSES THE CONCERNS RELATED TO COVER NINETEEN TESTING THAT WERE IN THE GOVERNOR'S.
