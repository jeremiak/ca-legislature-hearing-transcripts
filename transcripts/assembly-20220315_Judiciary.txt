ALL RIGHT OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. REDRESS THANK YOU I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD ONE OF THE COMMENTS FROM THE- AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN THAT THEY HAD PRESENTED. WAS AT THE GAPS REMAIN FOR WOMEN OF COLOR. ADD TO RECOGNIZING FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THEY GAVE IS THAT THE PIPELINE FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR RECEIVING DOCTORAL DEGREES IS DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW. ONLY FIVE POINT 4% OF DOCTORATES ARE AWARDED TO BLACK STUDENTS AND MORE THAN A DOZEN FEELS DIDN'T HAVE A SINGLE BLACK DOCTORAL RECIPIENT. IT'S TRUE FOR OTHER PROFESSIONS AND LIGHT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS RECOGNITION. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE KNOW SOMETHING GOOD HAS HAPPENED. BUT WE'VE GOT A WAYS TO GO JUST AS YOU MENTIONED THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE THIS BOERNER HORVATH YOU MAY CLOSE YES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET BUT ONCE WE ESTABLISH A QUORUM WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE IT UP. THANK YOU. WILL MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER TWO AB SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX MS BURKE AHEAD. GOOD MORNING MORNING THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO FIRST THANK THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE WORK WITH US ON THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS CONSTITUTIONAL AND EFFECTIVE I'M ACCEPTING THE CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE AND BALLOT ENTITIES ITS PROTECTION. I WANT TO START BY SAYING. THAT OUR CONSTITUTION IS CLEAR HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT WE ARE A STATE THE BRITAX A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO ACCESS ABORTION WORKING TO TAKE THAT RIGHT AWAY FROM WOMEN BUT WE AS A STATE ARE CLEAR AND MUST REMAIN VIGILANT IN ENSURING THAT EVERYBODY IN OUR BORDERS IS PROTECTED IN THEIR RIGHT TO ACCESS AN ABORTION. THE QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER ABORTIONS WILL HAPPEN AS WE KNOW WHEN WE'VE SEEN THE DATA HAS RECENTLY SHOWN. THEY WILL HAPPEN. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER WE RISK AND RUIN THE LIVES. OR WHETHER WE PROTECT THEM. WHETHER ABORTION WILL BE SAFE. OR DANGEROUS WHETHER CHOICE WILL BE LEGAL OR FINANCIALLY RUINOUS. WITH ABORTION LEFT UP TO THE STATE IS UP TO A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA AND OUR PARTNERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO SUPPORT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE TO STAND UP FOR THAT RIGHT. I'M PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX A MEASURE THAT WILL PRO ACTIVELY PROTECT CALIFORNIANS FROM CIVIL LIABILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS TO RECEIVE PROVIDE OR EIGHT AN ABORTION CARE. AB SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX A SYMBOL. IT DECLARES THAT ANY CIVIL ACTION FOR EATING IN OR RECEIVING AN ABORTION. IS CONTRARY TO THE PUBLIC POLICY OF CALIFORNIA AND IS THEREFORE UNENFORCEABLE IN OUR STATE COURTS. THE PUBLIC POLICY EXEMPTION OF THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE STATES. THAT THE STATES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO APPLY IN OTHER STATES LAW THAT VIOLATES ITS OWN LEGITIMATE PUBLIC POLICY AS I'VE SAID THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION IS CLEAR THAT THE RIGHT TO AN ABORTION IS PART OF THE PUBLIC POLICY INTEREST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S WE HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO ENFORCE CIVIL PENALTIES THAT VIOLATE ABORTION RIGHTS PROTECTED IN OUR CONSTITUTION. WHEN A PREGNANT PERSON'S CHOICES ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES QUESTIONED THE LIVES OF ALL PREGNANT PEOPLE ARE AT STAKE. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT WOMEN AND PROVIDERS THAT ARE ENSURING ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. THIS WILL PROVIDE THOSE PROTECTIONS AND CONTINUE TO MAKE CALIFORNIA A SANCTUARY FOR THOSE WHO SEEK REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE. WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL OUR SELENA SANDOVAL IN OBGYN PROVIDER UC SAN DIEGO AND DIEGO ZAMBRANO A PROFESSOR OF LAW AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY. THANK YOU I DO HAVE THOSE TWO WITNESSES LISTED BOTH WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE SALINAS AND OF ALL ARE YOU WITH US. YES I'M HERE GO AHEAD PLEASE.

I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING DISTRICT NINE OF THE AMERICAN CONGRESS OF THE APPLICATIONS AND DATA COLLEGES. WHO CO SPONSORING ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX. AS STATED ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX PROVIDES PROTECTION TO ABORTION PATIENT AND CLINICIAN. BY PROHIBITING CIVIL ACTION FROM ANY OTHER STATE LAW CAN BE APPLIED TO THOSE IN CALIFORNIA. AS A PHYSICIAN WHO PROVIDES FULL SPECTRUM ABORTION CARE I CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT THE PROTECTIONS ARE NOT MOST IMPORTANT. AS YOU ALL KNOW THE CURRENT POLITICAL CLIMATE IS ALLOWING FOR UNPRECEDENTED. UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNTS OF LEGISLATION ATTACKING THE PRODUCTIVE RIGHT. IN CALIFORNIA MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE ARE YOU SEEN PATIENTS TRAVELING FROM TEXAS UNDER SB EIGHT SAID TAKE CARE. OKLAHOMA PASSED SIMILAR LEGISLATION AND WE'RE CONFIDENT THE TREND WILL CONTINUE. AN ESTIMATED THIRTY SIX MILLION PEOPLE WHO CAN GET PREGNANT WILL LOSE ACCESS TO ABORTION IF THE SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS ROE V. WADE. I HAVE BEEN PER ON THE EFFECT OF LIMITING ACCESS TO ABORTION. PATIENTS ARE FORCED TO THE LEADER CARE THERE TRAVELING HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS FILED. REACHING EIGHTEEN MASSIVE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES JUST UNDERGO A SIMPLE INTAKE MEDICAL PROCEDURE. AND UNFORTUNATELY THE PATIENT OF THE LUCKY ONES THE ONES WITH THE PRIVILEGE AND THE MEANS TO ACTUALLY TRAVEL OUT OF. STATE CRAP EVEN MORE CONCERN IS THE REASON LEGISLATORS LEGISLATION PRESENTED IN THE VERY. THAT'S SUPPORT CIVIL SUITS AGAINST ANYONE PERFORMING AN ABORTION ON THE VERY RIGHT. I THINK MY PATIENTS THAT DEVALUE THEY COME TO ME WITH THE NEED FOR A SERVICE I CAN PROVIDE AND I WILL NEVER INTERROGATE I TEACH US ABOUT THEIR STATE OF ORIGIN. I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES TREAT THEIR PATIENTS WITH THE SAME RESPECT UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NO LONGER THEORETICAL AND LEGISLATION LIKE THIS WITH A CALIFORNIA PROVIDERS AT RISK. WE KNOW ABORTION IS A MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN CALIFORNIA BECOMING A FIFTY THAN IN DESTINATION BAKER PROTECTING REPRODUCTIVE RIGHT. I'M HONORED TO SERVE MY PATIENTS BUT I CAN ONLY CONTINUE TO DO THAT SAFELY WITH THE CORPORATE PROTECTION. PLEASE ALLOW MY COLLEAGUES AND I THE PEACE OF MIND TO FOCUS ON THE PATIENT SITTING IN FRONT OF US EVERY DAY. HELPS PROTECT ABORTION ACCESS IN CALIFORNIA BY PUTTING IT ON US AND WE BUILT SIXTY SIXTY SIX. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND THEY WE HAVE TO. SEVERAL YES GOOD MORNING TEARS DOWN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE.

CHALLENGE THANK YOU B. B. SIX. I BELIEVE THE BILL COMPLIES WITH THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION AND WOULD SURVIVE A CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE. THE BILL REPORT DISCUSS WITH THEM THE POTENTIAL ISSUE IF THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE OF ARTICLE FOUR SECTION ONE OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. UNDER THAT CAUGHT THE TO WRITE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE OTHER STATES STATUTE PUBLIC RECORDS AND COURT DECISIONS. AND AT FIRST GLANCE IT WOULD SEEM TO FORECLOSE THE POSSIBILITY THAT CALIFORNIA COULD DECLINE TO ENTERTAIN KIDS UNDER OTHER STATES BOX. HOWEVER THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE DOES NOT AYE AND QUIET AND CONTAINED THROUGH WELL RECOGNIZED EXCEPTION. THE PUBLIC POLICY EXCEPTION IN THE PENAL JUDGMENTS EXCEPTION. AND I THINK THE COURT WOULD UPHOLD AB FIFTEEN EXPECT UNDER THE WELL RECOGNIZED EXCEPTIONS. FOR THANK YOU SIX SIX THE ONE PROHIBITS CALIFORNIA COURTS FROM ENTERTAINING CLAIMS UNDER ANTI ABORTION LAWS LIKE TEXAS SB EIGHT. THAT PROVISION IS MOST LIKELY CONSTITUTIONAL UNDER THE PUBLIC POLICY. EXCEPTION WHICH SPEEDS THAT. PETER NOT OBLIGATE TO OF AND OTHER STATE LAWS. AND THE OF THE LAW RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO PREGNANCIES THIS. WITHIN CAL OWN JEREMY PUBLIC POLICY. AND THANK CALIFORNIA MAY WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PIANO JUDGE EXCEPT. LEVEL FAITH AND CREDIT CARD. PREVENTED COURTS FROM SB SPELL JUDGMENT. INVESTIGATED CALIFORNIA IS NOT BOUND TO REPORT ANYCLAIMS UNDER SB EIGHT OR OTHER COMPATIBLE LOS. TOONTOWN MY BELIEVE THE LAW WOULD SURVIVE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES. AND THEREFORE SUPPORT AB.

I AM GO AHEAD GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SUSAN ARNOLD I AM AN ATTORNEY AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF OUTREACH AT THE RIGHT TO LIFE LEAD AMERICA'S FIRST PRO LIFE ORGANIZATION WE OPPOSE AB ONE SIX SIX SIX THE BILL BLATANTLY VIOLATE THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE OF THE U. S. CONSTITUTION ARTICLE FOUR SECTION ONE OF THE CONSTITUTION STATE QUOTE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT SHALL BE GIVEN IN EACH STATE TO THE PUBLIC ACTS RECORDS AND JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF EVERY. OTHER STATE. IN COURT HAS APPLIED THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE TWO JUDGMENTS AS RECENTLY AS NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT IN BAKER VERSUS GMC EXPLICITLY STATING QUOTE THIS COURT. HAS HELD THAT CREDIT MUST BE GIVEN TO THE JUDGMENT OF ANOTHER STATE ALTHOUGH THE FORM WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO ENTERTAIN THE SUIT ON WHICH THE JUDGMENT WAS FOUNDED. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT MEANS YOU CAN'T IGNORE OTHER STATE LAWS EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM YOU MUST RESPECT THEM. A. B. ONE SIX SIX SIX DOES THE OPPOSITE IT DISRESPECTS OTHER STATE LAWS THAT DON'T FIT THE RADICAL ABORTION AGENDA ALLOWING PEOPLE CONVICTED OF AN ILLEGAL ABORTION IN ANOTHER STATE TO ESCAPE JEFF THIS. HEAT IS VIRTUE SIGNALLING DRESSED UP IN A BILL. WHAT IF TEXAS DECIDED TO IGNORE CALIFORNIA'S RECOGNITION OF SAME SEX MARRIAGES. MAKE IT CLEAR CALIFORNIA'S SAME SEX MARRIAGES UNENFORCEABLE NO IT CANNOT. AND AB ONE SIX SIX SIX CANNOT PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH STATE JUDGMENT TO ENFORCE EITHER. AND CONSIDER THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF THIS ILL CONCEIVED BILL BUT THE USERS IN OTHER STATES COULD TRAFFIC WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND MINORS. WORSE THEM TO GET ABORTIONS TO COVER EVIDENCE AND THEN THE FLEET TO CALIFORNIA TO AVOID CIVIL JUDGMENT. HOW DOES THAT PROTECT WOMEN IT DOES NOT. FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE YOU TO VOTE NO. ON AB ONE SIX SIX SIX. THANK YOU YOUR HONOR ROLL CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS I EXPLAINED IN MY SUBMITTED LEGAL OPINION LETTER AND TESTIFYING TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL ATTORNEY THE LITIGATOR EXPERIENCE WITH MEDICAL MALPRACTICE LAWSUITS I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON AB ONE SIX SIX SIX BECAUSE IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND WILL HARM WOMEN. FIRST THE BILL IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL ARE BASED CALIFORNIA IS PART OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS BOUND BY THE U. S. CONSTITUTION IS NOT A NATION OF A LAW INTO ITSELF AS SUCH IT IS OBLIGATED TO DEMONSTRATE RESPECT FOR THE PUBLIC LAW THE STATE COURT JUDGMENTS ABOUT THEIR STATE JURISDICTION. THIS BILL VIOLATES ARTICLE FOUR SECTION ONE OF THE US CONSTITUTION AND TO FADE AWAY IN THE OF OTHER STATE. SECOND CALIFORNIA DOCTOR BRAZENLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL POLICY OF HOSTILITY TOWARD THE LAWS OF OTHER STATES BOTH ARE FACIAL VIOLATIONS OF THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE IF ENACTED. BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL ATTORNEY I CAN ASSURE YOU CALIFORNIA WILL SPEND A LOT OF MONEY DEPENDING THIS BILL AND WILL LEAD TO THAT THE U. S. SUPREME COURT. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE OUR TAXPAYER MONEY ON DEFENDING THE INDEFENSIBLE SECOND THIS BILL WILL HARM WOMEN. WITH OVER BROAD LAW DOES NOT NEARLY IMPACT THE FETAL HEARTBEAT LAWS OF OTHER STATES RATHER IT'S SWEEPING LANGUAGE ATTEMPTS TO CREATED AN IMPENETRABLE SHIELD FOR THE ASSETS OF CALIFORNIA DOCTORS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN ONE OTHER STATES COURTS HAVE COMMITTED MEDICAL MALPRACTICE EVEN IF OTHER WOMEN OR GIRLS HAVE BEEN HARMED OR KILLED IN OTHER STATES BECAUSE THE MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE OR RECKLESSNESS. IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNJUST TO DENY PEOPLE BEEN HARMED IN MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE ELSEWHERE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE CIVIL DAMAGES IN CALIFORNIA IT ALSO PROVIDES ADJUSTABLE LIABILITY PROTECTION FOR OTHER BAD ACTORS INCLUDING SEX TRAFFICKERS. UNLAWFULLY. COERCED WOMEN AND GIRLS. WORKS INJURED PERSON TO NOT BE DENIED BAIL LEGAL REMEDIES. INCLUDING CIVIL. THIS BILL IS SIMPLY AND ADJUST I STRONGLY URGES COMMITTEE TO VOTE NO BECAUSE IT YES EIGHTY SIX ONE SIX SIX SIX WILL HARM WOMEN. UNITS FACIALLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU OPERATOR YOU MAY CLOSE THE LINES AND I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE- COMMITTEE. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S CONSTITUTIONAL TENSION HERE AND I THINK THE ANALYSIS DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB OF. LAYING THAT OUT AND- I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT OF. THE QUESTION OF US RESPECTING EVEN THOUGH. SOME OF THE LAWS THAT ARE BEING PROMULGATED OTHER STATES I DON'T THINK WE HEAR NECESSARILY HAVE RESPECT FOR THEM BUT- THIS IS ABOUT RESPECT FOR OUR LAWS OUR CONSTITUTION THAT'S THE BALANCE HERE AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK MAKES THIS. APPROPRIATELY CONSTITUTIONAL AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE EXCELLENT ANALYSIS RIGHT MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF ALSO I. REALLY APPRECIATE THE NOW SAYS AND IF IT IS A VERY CLEAR PUBLIC POLICY. EXEMPTION TO YOUR APPOINTMENTS OR SHARE THAT- YOU KNOW WE HAVE OUR OBLIGATION TO OUR RESIDENTS OUR COMMUNITY ARE WOMEN- AND WE'RE NOT GONNA ALLOW OTHER STATES TO DICTATE- HOW WE SEE FIT IN. PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITY AND THE PEOPLE LIVE IN OUR STATE AND- AND DOES THAT WOULD BE UNDER OUR JURISDICTION AND SO- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I KNOW IT'S A- CAN BE VERY CONTENTIOUS TO BRING- FOR BILLS IN THIS ARENA. BUT IT'S SO IMPORTANT AND SO VERY IMPORTANT AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL- THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO STEM THE TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR- WHERE WHERE WE STAND UP NOT ONLY AS A STATE BUT WHERE OUR VALUES AE- IN TERMS OF. PROTECTING A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE- AND OF WOMEN'S- SAKSHAM NATION- OVER THEIR LIVES IN THEIR BODIES. AND AS EVERY MOTIONS SURE OTHERS NOT LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION. SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION AS THEIR SECOND. AND A SECOND THANK YOU. REDRESS PROTEGER. OKAY THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT CIGNA YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR HIS COMMENTS I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE EXCELLENT ANALYSIS AND- I THINK IT DOESN'T INCREDIBLE JOB OF LAYING OUT EXACTLY WHAT. WE BELIEVE TO BE THE CASE HERE WHICH IS THAT ALTHOUGH THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE IS ABSOLUTELY PART OF THE CONSTITUTION AND ONE THAT OUR STATE ENFORCES EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS AND IT THIS CLEARLY FALLS UNDER THAT EXCEPTION. AS MISTER DIMARTINO SAID AND THEN ALICE'S REITERATES BOTH BECAUSE THESE LAWS ARE PENAL IN NATURE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BRINGING THESE SUITS DO NOT UNDER CALIFORNIA'S LAWS HAVE STANDING THEY HAVEN'T BEEN INJURED. I'M IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE A CLEAR PUBLIC POLICY EXEMPTION AND WE HAVE NO LAWCENTER BOX THAT WOULD DO THIS IN OUR OWN STATE BETTER K. STATE COURT WOULD ENFORCE AND SO AS A RESULT WE DO NOT NEED TO ENFORCE THOSE IN OTHER STATES. I WOULD LIKE TO CORRECT THE RECORD ON ONE THING THAT WAS SAID BY THE OPPOSITION AS A LONGTIME ALLY OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WHEN SOME STATES DID ALLOW FOR GAY MARRIAGE. THOSE WHO WERE MARRIED IN THE STATE'S WERE NOT GIVEN THE BENEFITS OF THOSE MARRIAGES AND OTHER STATES AND I DON'T WANT THE RECORD OF HISTORY TO BE UNCLEAR ON THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS WHAT HAPPENED AS THE SISTER OF SOMEONE WHO IS MARRIED HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND WAS NOT GRANTED THOSE PRIVILEGES IN WISCONSIN. I WANT THAT TO BE CLEAR- I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THAT LANGUAGE AS WE WORKED ON WITH- THE COMMITTEE WAS CRAFTED TO ENSURE THE MALPRACTICE SUITS WHERE SOMEONE. IS INJURED BECAUSE THE DOCTOR DOES NOT DO THEIR JOB AS THEY SHOULD. DOES NOT FALL UNDER THIS LAW AS YOU WILL READ THAT LANGUAGE OF THE LIGHT IS. NARROW IN SCOPE TO JUST THOSE THAT ARE ASSISTING IN. OR GIVING SOMEONE AN ABORTION NOT SOMEONE WHO DOES SO WHILE COMMITTING MALPRACTICE. I'M AND WITH THAT I JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY SAYING THAT. I AM SO GRATEFUL TO BE CALIFORNIAN AS A WOMAN AS A MOTHER OF A YOUNG DAUGHTER. I LIVE IN A STATE THAT WILL FOREVER GIVE MY DAUGHTER I HOPE NOT THOUGH I SHOULDN'T SAY FOREVER. THE RIGHT TO CONTROL HER OWN FUTURE AND HER OWN BODY AND TODAY WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO ENSURE THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS IN ANY OTHER STATE IN THIS UNION. THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO GRANT THOSE RIGHTS TO THE WOMEN AND GIRLS THE STATE AND WE WILL SAY TO EVERY SINGLE PROVIDER IN OUR BORDERS WE'VE GOT YOUR BACK BECAUSE WE BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS PROVIDING.

B. EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN MINS BONTA MORGAN MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS ALSO CARRIED LIKE TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HELP WITH THESE AMENDMENTS. IN TWENTY TWENTY IN RESPONSE TO A GROWING NUMBER OF EXISTING CALIFORNIA HOMES BEING ACQUIRED BY INVESTOR CORPORATIONS THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED SB TEN SEVENTY NINE WHICH PROVIDED A SPECIAL WINDOW FOR RESIDENTS OR NON PROFITS TO MATCH OR EXCEED THE BID OF INVESTORS AT FORECLOSURE AUCTIONS. HOWEVER DESPITE THE LAW HOUSING ADVOCATES HAVE OBSERVED FOR PROFIT ACTORS CONTINUE TO FIND WAYS TO DEFY AND MANIPULATE CURRENT LAW IN THEIR FAVOR. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN AT LEAST ONE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CASE ALL PRESENT BIDDERS AT AN AUCTION WERE URGED TO SIGN A WAIVER FORM. ATTESTING THAT THEY WERE PERSPECTIVE OWNER OCCUPANTS AND WOULD USE THE PROPERTY AS THEIR PRIMARY RESIDENCE EVEN WHEN CERTAIN BIDDERS HAD NO INTENTION OF DOING SO. THESE ACTIONS EFFECTIVELY PRECLUDED THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ACTUAL PROSPECTIVE HOMEOWNERS TO PLACE A BID ON THESE HOMES IN OTHER CASES ILLEGITIMATE NONPROFITS PURCHASE THESE HOMES WITH NO INTENTION OF PROVIDING HOUSES HOUSING FOR FAMILIES ONE SUCH ILLEGITIMATE NONPROFIT SLIPPED A HOME AT A 12% PROFIT. AFTER ONLY OWNING IT FOR A FEW SHORT WEEKS AND WITHOUT MAKING ANY IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PROPERTY TO JUSTIFY THE PRICE INCREASE. MY BILL EIGHTEEN EIGHT EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN THE HOUSING THE HOMES IN COMMUNITY HANDS ACT WAS RESOLVED IMPLEMENTATION GAPS IN THE EXISTING FORECLOSURE INTERVENTION ON INSURING FOR CLOSED HOMES BE PRIORITIZED FOR RESIDENTS AND THE COMMUNITY NOT CORPORATIONS. SPECIFICALLY AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN ROBOT REVISES THE DEFINITION OF AN ELIGIBLE NONPROFIT BUYER EXPANDS AFFIDAVIT AND DECLARATION. REQUIREMENTS FOR ELIGIBLE BIDDERS STRENGTHENS ENFORCEMENT AND REQUIRES THAT IN SPECIFIC CASES UNITS BE MAINTAINED AS AFFORDABLE TO LOWER IN COME. ALL AS EIGHTEEN AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN AS A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE WAY FOR A STATE TO PROMOTE HOMEOWNERSHIP PRESERVATION. TO ENSURE PROPER IMPLEMENTATION OF pINTERVENTION LAW AND HELP KEEP HOMEOWNERSHIP AND HOUSING WITHIN THE REACH OF FAMILIES. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE REALTORS ASSOCIATION TO ADDRESS THEIR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AND HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL OF THE AMENDMENTS THEY REQUESTED. THERE'S ONE OUTSTANDING ISSUE THAT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO AGREE ON AT THE TIME IN TIME FOR TODAY'S HEARING BUT WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO REACHING A CONSENSUS. THANK YOU AND AS WITNESSES PERMITS FOR IT WITH ME TODAY I HAVE ANY KINDS OF SHAKE WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY LAND TRUST NETWORK A CALL ON SERVE THIS BILL. AND MIKE BALOCH WITH THE UNITED TRUSTEES ASSOCIATION. I THANK YOU AND BOTH WITNESSES ARE HERE IN THE ROW SO PLEASE. FIVE THANK YOU SO MUCH HONORABLE CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS AMY HIGHNESS SHEIKH WITH WILDCAT CONSULTING REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY LAND TRUST NETWORK TODAY. THE COMMUNITY LAND TRUST MODEL IS BASED ON ACQUIRING PROPERTY AND STEWARDING THE LAND IN PERPETUAL TRUST FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WE DO THIS THROUGH OUR NINETY NINE YEAR GROUND LEASE WE RETAIN OWNERSHIP OF THE LAND UNDERNEATH THE STRUCTURES WE ACQUIRE AND WE LEASE OR SELL THE STRUCTURES ON TOP OF THE LAND FOR A PHOTO. AFFORDABLE HOUSING NATURALLY WE WERE QUITE EXCITED WHEN SB TEN SEVENTY NINE THE HOUSING FOR HOME OWNERS NOT CORPORATIONS ACT WENT INTO EFFECT JANUARY FIRST OF LAST YEAR. ONE OF OUR AFFILIATE CLT IS PARTNERED WITH TENANTS JOCELYN FOREMAN FROM PINOLE CALIFORNIA TO ACQUIRE THE HOME SHE HAD BEEN RENTING AS THE FIRST TO KNOWN SB TEN SEVENTY NINE ACQUISITION. WE THOUGHT WE COULD HELP THOUSANDS OF JOCELYN FOREMAN'S ACROSS THIS GREAT STATE WHEN THE FORECLOSURE INTERVENTION HOUSING PRESERVATION PROGRAM WAS FUNDED IN JUNE OF LAST YEAR TO HELP NONPROFIT PARTNERS. NONPROFITS PARTNER WITH ASPIRING LOW INCOME HOMES HOME OWNERS TO ACQUIRE PROPERTIES THROUGH THE S. B. TEN SEVENTY NINE PROCESS HOWEVER IN ATTENDING MORE FORECLOSURE AUCTION SOME THINGS BECAME CLEAR EXACTLY WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA HAD- US. LINEATED HERE ABOUT THE OF FRAUDULENT SB TEN SEVENTY NINE WAIVER FORM AND ALSO THE FRAUDULENT NON PROFITS BEHAVIOR ARE EXACTLY WHY WE URGENTLY NEED AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN THE HOMES IN COMMUNITY HANDS ACT WE THANK THE AUTHOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER BONTA FOR HER VISIONARY LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU THAT'S WORTH PLEASE MR TURN MEMBERS MIKE BILLOWED ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED TRUSTEES ASSOCIATION. FORECLOSURE TRUSTEES ARE REALLY THE TIP OF THE SPEAR ON THE S. B. TEN SEVENTY NINE PROCESS AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE THE ONLY ACTOR IT'S AND THEY'RE SLOWLY ADMINISTERING THIS. THIS PROGRAM. SO IT IS THE FORECLOSURE TRUSTEE AFTER THE TRUSTEE'S SALE WHO RECEIVES THE NOTICES OF INTENT TO BID. WHO TAKES THE ACTUAL BIDS AND EVALUATES THEM THE VALUE WAIT THE BONA FIDES OF THE NONPROFIT ENTITY AND SO IS THE WHOLE PROCESS THROUGH TO COMPLETION. THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLING ME AND TALKING ABOUT SHADY NON PROFITS THAT APPEARED TO BE ATTEMPTING TO ABUSE THE SYSTEM ACTUALLY I'VE ACTUALLY RECEIVED CALLS MYSELF IN MY OFFICE. FROM ALLEGED NON PROFITS THAT SOUNDED SHADY TO ME. SO THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT. THAT TRUSTEES ARE ACTUALLY GETTING SUED ABOUT THESE ISSUES TODAY AND I'LL JUST GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF ONE. SO THE TRUSTEE TOOK A BED FROM A NON PROFIT INVESTIGATED THE NONPROFIT LOOK AT THEIR ORGANIZATION DOCUMENTS AND SAW. THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE ORGANIZATION DOCUMENTS OF THE ORGANIZATION. THEY GOT SUED BECAUSE THE LAW SAYS THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE ORGANIZATION MUST BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THE ASSOCIATE AND THE ORGANIZATION DOCUMENTS IDN'T SAY PRIMERICA IT JUST SAID IT WAS ONE OF THE PURPOSES SILK LITIGATION IS COMING OUT OF THIS PRO. PROGRAM AND WE THINK THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL WILL HELP IMPROVE THE PROCESS- TO THE BENEFIT OF THE PUBLIC AND FRANKLY TRUSTEES AND FOR THAT WE WOULD ASK FOR AN IPHONE. THANK YOU.

I HAD I WILL WAIT FOR YOUR WINDOWS TO COME UP. THE BEST TEAM IN PERSON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT AB SIXTEEN EIGHTY SIX A BILL THAT WOULD CLARIFY REFERRAL CRITERIA CONCERNING DEPENDENT CHILDREN PLACED IN FOSTER CARE AS WIDE AGREEMENT. WITHIN THE CHILD WELFARE COMMUNITY THAT THE BEST THING FOR MOST CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE TO BE REUNIFIED WITH THEIR FAMILIES. HOWEVER SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WILL. BEGIN MAKING STATES RECOUP THE COST OF FOSTER CARE FROM PARENTS OF FOSTER YOUTH. A CONTRADICTORY PRACTICE THAT GOES AGAINST THE STATED GOAL. OF REUNIFYING FAMILIES CALIFORNIA DATA SHOWS THAT MANY PARENTS ARE REQUIRED TO PAY THESE EXPENSES. EXPERIENCE EXTREME POVERTY. THE PRACTICE IS WRONG FOR MANY REASONS WHEN PARENTS HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR CHILD'S DAYCARE CHILDREN MEANING CARE ALMOST SEVEN MONTHS LONGER. THAT IS NECESSARY WE SAY THAT WE SUPPORT FAMILY REUNIFICATION ARE CURRENT LAWS MAKE IT HARDER FOR FAMILIES TO DO JUST THAT. REUNIFY IT ALSO HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT. ON BLACK BROWN POINT INDIGENOUS FAMILIES. EVEN MORE SO THAN OTHERS. WE SAY THE MONEY'S TAXPAYER DOLLARS WISELY TO INVEST IN PROGRAMS THAT WORK FOR FAMILIES BUT THE RESEARCH SHOWS THE TRYING TO COLLECT PAYMENTS FROM CPS INVOLVED FAMILIES COST TAXPAYERS MORE THAN THE GOVERNMENT COLLECTING PAYMENTS BACK FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR IN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WE ACTUALLY COLLECT TWENTY SEVEN CENTS. AB SIXTEEN EIGHTY SIX REQUIRE FAR WELL FOR AGENCIES TO PRESUME THAT PAYMENT A FOSTER CARE COSTS. UNNECESSARILY EXTEND CHILDREN'S TIME IN FOSTER CARE. WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE CASE AND PRACTICE. AT THE EXPENSE OF CHILDREN. IS POLICY CLARIFIES BUT THAT THE CLARIFICATION THIS POLICY WILL ENSURE THAT THE DECISION ABOUT REFERRALS ARE MADE MORE UNIFORM ACROSS ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA WHICH WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES REQUIRED TO PAY FOR THE CHILD STAY IN FOSTER CARE BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF REFERRALS PARENTS SEEKING TO BE REUNITED WITH THEIR FAMILIES WILL BE ABLE TO USE. THAT THAT INCOME INSTEAD OF PAYING IT BACK TO THE COUNTIES TO BUILD THEIR HOMES AND TO BUILD A HEALTHY AND THRIVING ENVIRONMENT. FOR THEM AND THEIR CHILDREN. I'M JOINED TODAY BY. SABRINA FORTE DIRECTOR OF POLICY AND IMPACT LITIGATION ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS. AND KATHY SINGLING MCDONALD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. OF ON BEHALF OF THE CHILD WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION TO TEST. THANK THANK YOU I DO HAVE THOSE TWO WITNESSES LISTED SABRINA FOR TODAY ARE YOU WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE. YES I'M HERE GO AHEAD PLEASE WHEN YOU WORK. MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS THE BRING OF WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE CHEC ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS THE CROWD COSPONSORED EIGHTY IN EIGHTY SIX. HAS THE OPERATOR WE SEEM TO HAVE SOME. HEY BEFORE TO GO AHEAD. ALL RIGHT GOOD MORNING HERE NUMBER THAT IS THE THING OF WHY CAN BE HALF OF THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS THE PASSCODE ON THIRD EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY SIX I WANT TO SHARE THE STORY OF ONE INDIVIDUAL EREKAT WHO CLAIM TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB SIXTEEN EIGHTY SIX TODAY BUT WAS UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE AT THE LAST MINUTE- DAUGHTER WAS PLCED IN FOSTER CARE IN AUGUST THE TWENTY NINETEEN. AFTERWARD SHE CALLED THE COURT TO RESPOND TO IN ORDER TO PAY FOR THE COST TO PROVIDERS HERE ORDERED TO TAKE NINE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE DOLLARS MONTHLY FEE BUT HARD TO REDUCE HER AMOUNT TO FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH. LASTED FOR THE REST OF THE TIME HER DAUGHTER WAS IN CARE PLUS ANOTHER FOUR MONTHS AFTERWARDS ERICA KEEPS PLAN REQUIRED FOR COMPLETE MULTIPLE THIRD OFFENSE SHE DID EVERYTHING SHE COULD TO GET HER CHILD BACK TAKING PARENTING CLASSES MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION AND PARTICIPATING IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAM. THE CARD TO HOLD ON TO HER HOUSING WITH AN EXTRA. FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. SHE COULDN'T MAINTAIN HER. THE COUNTY. MANY TIMES. FOR HER TO SHOW AT THE PIANO OTHER MEETINGS THAT WE'RE ALWAYS APPROVED BY KERN. LEADING TO HER BEING MY GO. ERICA OPEN AT LEAST REUNIFY WITH HER AND NEARLY TWO YEAR. BUT ONCE THE COMMITTEE TO THAT PARA PAY FOR PROCTER GOES AGAINST CHILD WELFARE PRESIDENT FOR MAINLY TO PROTECT AND HELP CHILDREN AND FAMILY REUNIFY. WE AGREE WITH ERR AND DEAR I MONEY SIX EIGHT THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND THE CENTRAL HERE IN THE ROOM THANK YOU MISTER SHE FIRST CENTER MCDONOUGH WITH THE COUNTY WHAT DIRECTOR OF SUCH. AS THE OTHER NOTED THIS BILL CLARIFIES PAYMENT REFERRAL CRITERIA FOR PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN ARE PLACED IN THE FOSTER CARE. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM CAN BUT IT'S NOT REQUIRED TO MAKE A REFERRAL FOR PAYMENT M. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT IT WOULD NOT BE A BARRIER TO BE UNIFICATION. THIS LAW WHICH TO W. D. A. ACTUALLY COSPONSORED A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO HAS REDUCED REFERRALS BUT THEY DO STILL OCCUR ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. THIS BILL WOULD CLARIFY THAT SEE THE BEST MUST PRESUME THAT PAYMENT OF SUPPORT BY THE PARENT IS LIKELY TO POSE A BARRIER TO BE UNIFICATION. AND THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH RESEARCH FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS THE CHILD WELFARE INVOLVED. PARENTS PAY THEIR CHILD TO RATIONING CARE LINCOLN'S FOR SIX POINT SIX MONTHS AND THIS IS EVEN WORSE FOR FAMILIES OF COLOR WHO ARE OVER REPRESENTED IN CHILD CALIFORNIA'S CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. FAMILIES WERE SUPPORTED BY PUBLIC SYSTEMS ARE BETTER ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY REUNIFIED WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND CONVERSELY ENFORCING PAYMENTS BY FOSTER BY PARENTS WHO ARE FINANCIALLY STRUGGLING ALREADY. GENERALLY JUST SERVES TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO REUNIFY SO THIS CLARIFICATION EFFECTIVELY NARROWS THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WILL MAKE REFERRALS. AND IT WILL IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR FOSTER YOUTH AND THEIR BIOLOGICAL FAMILIES BY EATING FAMILY REUNIFICATION WHILE KEEPING CALIFORNIA LAW WITHIN FEDERAL PARAMETERS. THANK YOUNG WE URGE OUR I THOUGHT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT OPERATOR WILL NOW GO TO THE PHONE LINES FOR ANYONE WHO'D LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR A BI.

OF THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU YOU HAVE A MOTION IS THEIR SECOND. AND A SECOND THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE. ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE THIS RIDE YOU MAY CLOSE THE RESEARCH IS VERY CLEAR THAT. THE LIKELIHOOD OF TOUCHING THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM ONLY DISRUPTS CHILDREN'S LIVES AND INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU TOUCH OTHER SYSTEMS LIKE THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM- AB SIXTEEN EIGHTY SIX WILL ENSURE THAT FAMILY UNIFICATION AS LONG WHAT NO LONGER DISRUPTED BY INCREASING FINANCIAL BURDENS. LEVIED ON FAMILIES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY FOSKETT STRONGLY ASK THIS COMMITTEE TO JOIN. JOIN ME IN MOVING THIS BILL. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE THE MOST IN A SECOND THAT MOTIONS TO PASSED TO THE COMMITTEE ON HUMAN SERVICES. KALRA STONE AYE STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM NO DAVIES. HOLDEN HOLDEN I KALRA KALRA AYE KILEY. KILEY NO MAIENSCHEIN MENTION I REYES. RIVAS RIVAS AYE WICKS. THAT STILL NEED ONE MORE VOTES WILL PUTON CALL THANK YOU THANK YOU. FOR RIGHT I REMEMBER FIVE AB SIXTEEN SIXTY THREE MISTER MAIENSCHEIN. OKAY. THANK GOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AS PROPOSED IN THE ANALYSIS AND THANKING THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR DILIGENT WORK I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB SIXTEEN SIXTY THREE THE PROBATE CONSERVATORSHIP REFORM AND SUPPORTED DECISION MAKING ACT AS MANY OF US SAW DURING THE HIGHLY PUBLICIZED BRITNEY SPEARS THIRTEEN YEAR BATTLE TO TERMINATE HER CONSERVATORSHIP. THE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA IS IN DESPERATE NEED OF REFORM. THOSE WHO AREMOST LIKELY. TO ENTER INTO A PROBATE CONSERVATORSHIP ARE PERSONS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AS WELL AS THOSE WITH AGE RELATED DISABILITIES SUCH AS DEMENTIA OR ALZHEIMER'S. PRIOR TO MY TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE I CLERKED FOR SAN DIEGO SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE WHO OVERSAW CONSERVATIVE SHIPS. DURING THAT TIME I SAW HOW EASY IT IS TO ENTER A SUCH A CONSERVATORSHIP AND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO LEAVE. I SAW THE POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE AND THE NEED FOR REFORMS I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING EVERY CONSERVATORSHIP ARE VARIED AND UNIQUE. THE DECISION TO SEEK A CONSERVATORSHIP IS NOT AN EASY ONE THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF CONSERVATORSHIP THAT ARE WORKING WELL FOR EVERYONE INCLUDING THE CONSERVATIVE AND IF THAT IS THE CASE THIS BILL DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO CHANGE THAT. HOWEVER THERE ARE CONSERVATORSHIP SO THAT ARE HARMFUL AS YOU WILL HEAR FROM ONE OF OUR WITNESSES TODAY OR UNNECESSARY MANY WELL MEANING FAMILIES ENTERED. CONSERVATORSHIP BECAUSE THEY'RE MISTAKENLY TOLD IT IS THE ONLY OPTION TO PROTECT THEIR LOVED ONES. WHEN A PERSON ENTERS A CONSERVATORSHIP ALL RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES ARE TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM AND PLACED IN THE CONTROL OF THEIR CONSERVATORY. WHEN THE COURT IS MAKING A DECISION TO STRIP AN INDIVIDUAL OF THEIR BASIC CIVIL LIBERTIES IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THIS ACTION ONLY BE TAKEN. IF IT IS THE LAST RESORT AB SIXTEEN SIXTY THREE SIX TO REFORM THE PROBATE CONSERVATORSHIP SYSTEM. INSTITUTING A MORE THOROUGH PROCESS AND ENSURING MEANINGFUL ALTERNATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED AND PRIORITIZED. FIRST IT JOINS BUT WILL THEY BE SIXTEEN SIXTY THREE WOULD JOIN EIGHTEEN OTHER STATES IN RECOGNIZING SUPPORTED DECISION MAKING AS A LESS RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVE. THE COURT MUST CONSIDER BEFORE GRANTING A CONSERVATORSHIP.% SUPPORTED DECISION MAKING IS A CONCEPT THAT OUT REALLY ALL OF US USE EVERY DAY WE A SEEK ADVICE FROM OUR FRIENDS AND FROM OUR FAMILY ABOUT DECISIONS. WHETHER THEY'RE BIG OR THEIR SMALL MAYBE BUYING A HOUSE CHANGING CAREERS OR EVEN OUT WHAT WE WANT TO EAT. RELYING ON OUR TRUSTED NETWORK HELPS US TO MAKE DECISIONS BUT ULTIMATELY WE ARE THE ONES WHO MAKE THE CHOICE. SUPPORTED DECISION MAKING AFFORD THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY TO THOSE WITH DISABILITIES AND ALLOWS AN INDIVIDUAL TO IDENTIFY TRUSTED SUPPORTERS TO HELP THEM MAKE AND COMMUNICATE DECISIONS. WHILE PROTECTING THE RIGHTS AND PRESERVING THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE CHOICES AND DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES. NEXT AB SIXTEEN SIXTY THREE CREATES A CONSERVATORSHIP ALTERNATIVES PROGRAM TO IDENTIFY CONSERVATORSHIP PETITIONS WERE LESS RESTRICTIVE OPTIONS MAY BE APPROPRIATE. IT ALSO ENSURES CONSERVATIVES MAINTAIN A CHOICE IN THEIR LIVES BY REQUIRING CONSERVATIVES TO CONSULT WITH CONSERVATIVES ON DECISIONS. AND TO MAKE DECISIONS ALIGNED WITH CONSERVATIVES COMMUNICATED WISHES. LASTLY AB SIXTEEN SIXTY THREE WILL MAKE CONSERVATORSHIP EASIER TO AND BY ENSURING CONSERVATIES KNOW THEIR RIGHTS. AND REQUIRE HEARINGS OF A CONSERVATIVE REQUEST TO TERMINATE THE CONSERVATORSHIP. I WANT TO THANK THE BROAD COALITION INCLUDING DISABILITY RIGHTS ADVOCATES AGING COMMUNITY ADVOCATES CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN THE FREE BRITNEY L. A. MOVEMENT FOR THEIR ON GOING WORK. TO MAKE THIS BILL THAT PASSED IN THE STRONGEST IT CAN BE. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO OF CONTACT MY OFFICE TO PROVIDE VALUABLE INPUT ABOUT THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. AND WE HAVE WORK TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS AB SIXTEEN SIXTY THREE IS VITAL LEGISLATION TO PROTECT AN INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS OVER THEIR LIVES. AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE HERE WITH ME TODAY TO SHARE THEIR STORIES ARE VENUS YES AND NINA SPIEGELMAN. THANKYOU. WE HAVE BOTH WITNESSES IN THE HEARING ROOM TODAY THE FIRST WITNESS PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD DAY TO ALL MY NAME IS VENUS GUEST AND I'M AN ADVOCATE FOR PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT REFORM IN CALIFORNIA NATION WHY. I'M A BOARD MEMBER OF THE UNITED SENIORS OF ALAMEDA COUNTY APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT AND BOARD OF SUPERVISOR NATE MILEY. WHY AM I IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE SIX SIX THREE. BECAUSE MY PARENTS EXPERIENCE PHYSICAL OR FINANCIAL ABUSE BY THE SUPERIOR COURT OF ALAMEDA COUNTY IN BERKELEY. WHEN JUDGE THOMAS BURDEN APPOINTED A TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP NICK MACHEL TERRON IN TO CARE FOR MY EIGHTY FOUR YEAR OLD MOTHER WITH DEMENTIA. INSTEAD OF PLACING HER IN THE LOVING AND CARING HANDS OF ME HER DAUGHTER. MY BEAUTIFUL THRIVING MOTHER DECLINED AND DETERIORATED NGUYEN NUMBER ONE. THE CONSERVATORSHIP ABRUPTLY SNATCHED MY MOTHER OUT OF A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WHERE SHE WAS THRIVING WITH PHYSICAL THERAPY MEDICAL STAFF ACTIVITIES AND A HEALTHY DIET. THE CONSERVATIVE WHO THEN PLACE MY MOTHER IN AN ISOLATED SUB STANDARD RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY WITH NO MEDICAL ATTENTION. AND MY MOTHER HAD GOOD INSURANCE. NUMBER TWO. THE CONSERVATORSHIP CONFISCATED MY MOTHER'S CALPERS RETIREMENT AND SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS THAT WERE NOT USED FOR MY MOTHER'S CARE AND THAT'S STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION WITH SOCIAL SECURITY. NUMBER THREE THE CONSERVATOR AND HER ATTORNEY ATTEMPTED TO SELL MY MOTHER'S. AND MY PARENTS EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR RENTAL PROPERTY TO PAY A SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR COURT FEES AND THE CONSERVATIVE THREATENS THE TENANTS TO GIVE HER THE RENTAL INCOME. NUMBER FOUR THE CONCERT OR GAVE MY MOTHER THREE TO SIX MONTHS TO LIVE WHEN SHE WAS NOT DYING SHE WAS NOT TERMINALLY ILL. AND FOUR YEARS LATER MY MOM SURVIVED. ON FEBRUARY FOURTEENTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT LOVE DAY CAUGHT VALENTINE'S DAY. WE HER FAMILY RESCUED MY MOTHER FROM THE RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY AND OUT OF THE HANDS OF ALL PUBLIC SERVANTS OF THE COURT WHO FILLED OUR FAMILY. WE TOOK HER HOME AND YES THE NATIONALLY THERE WAS FAMILY CONFLICT IN COURT BUT WE UNITED IN ENOUGH TIME TO SAVE MY MOTHER'S LIFE THE CONSERVATIVE JUDGE ATTORNEYS WERE NOT HAPPY BUT MOM WAS SAFE WE WERE HER VOICE WE BECAME HER SUPPORTIVE DECISION MAKING TEAM. MY MOTHER PASSED ON THANKSGIVING DAY TWENTY TWENTY ONE FREE AT HOME AT PEACE IN HER WARM BED AND WITH HER LOVING FAMILY THIS IS HOW AB ONE SIX SIX THREE COULD AND WOULD SUPPORT THE PEOPLE FAMILY FIRST. THANK YOU THANK YOU WELCOME PLACE GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS NINA SPIEGELMAN AND I'M THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR DISABILITY VOICES UNITED A CO SPONSOR OF AB SIXTEEN SIXTY THREE BUT MOST IMPORTANT I AM A SINGLE MOTHER OF A TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD SON WITH AUTISM AND HIGH SUPPORT NEEDS I AM ALSO MY SON'S CONSERVATIVE- AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. I UNDERSTAND THE INTENSE DESIRE BY PARENTS OF DISABLED ADULTS WITH COMPLEX NEEDS TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN I BELIEVE THIS BILL HELPS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES TO BE MORE PROTECTED AS WELL AS EMPOWERED FIRST LET ME BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES NOT DO IT DOES NOT END EXISTING PROBATE CONSERVATORSHIP OR ABOLISHED FUTURE CONSERVATORSHIP IT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY THE POWER OF CONSERVATIVES TO MAKE CHOICES FOR THEIR CONSERVATIVE HE'S AND IT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANYONE TO USE SUPPORT DECISION MAKING. HERE IS WHAT THE BILL ACTUALLY DOES. AB SIXTEEN SIXTY THREE ENSURES THAT CONSERVATORSHIP IS THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVE AS CURRENT LAW REQUIRES. IT MAKE SURE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES UNDERSTAND AND CONSIDER THE FULL RANGE OF OTHER OPTIONS BESIDES CONSERVATORSHIP. THE BILL PUTS ONE OF THOSE OPTIONS SUPPORTED DECISION MAKING INTO CALIFORNIA LAW FOR THE FIRST TIME. IT LETS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES CHOOSE TRUSTED SUPPORTERS TO HELP THEM MAKE DECISIONS. MY SON CAN BUILD A CIRCLE OF SUPPORT HE WILL BE AROUND LONG AFTER I AM GONE IT WILL EMPOWER HIM TO BUILD NEW SKILLS BY PARTICIPATING AND PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PERSONAL GROWTH. BEYOND THE OPPORTUNITIES IT WILL PROVIDE FOR MY SON I SEE AB SIXTEEN SIXTY THREE AS GROUNDBREAKING CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION. THIS BILL SAYS THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND OLDER ADULTS SHOULD BE RESPECTED AND EMPOWERED IT QUESTIONS THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO PROTECT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IS TO STRIP AWAY ALL OF THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS. IT SAYS CONSERVATORSHIP SHOULD BE RARE AND THE LAST RESORT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN FOR BEING SUCH AN INCREDIBLE CHAMPION FOR THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO PASS THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT CIVIL RIGHTS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR A BI SIXTEEN SIXTY THREE.
