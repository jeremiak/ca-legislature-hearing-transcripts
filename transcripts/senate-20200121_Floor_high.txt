THE OR DISCUSS N THIS ITEM DEBATE DISCUSS SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THE VOTERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION HAVE OFFERED THEIR OPINION WITH RESPECT TO SCHEDULE MARIJUANA AS A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG. THE VOTERS HAVE DECIDED THAT FOR PURPOSES OF STATE A CALIFORNIA MARIJUANA IS LEGAL. BUT THERE IS A MECHANICAL PROBLEM AS IT RELATES TO. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE HERE TRY TO PROTECT OUR PUBLIC SAFETY THE ASSISTANT MAJORITY LEADER TELLS ME STORIES OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS BURIED IN BARRELS AND COMMUNITIES THAT HE REPRESENTS. WE HAVE ALL SORTS OF STORIES READ OUR NEWSPAPERS AS THE AWFUL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA ARE TRYING TO ENGAGE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE ACTIVITY AND YET BECAUSE- OUR MARIJUANA REMAINS A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG THE FEDERAL BANKING SYSTEM CANNOT TAKE THAT MONEY. AND WE HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN THAT REGARD ALSO WITH RESPECT TO COLLECTING TAXES AND HAVING EXTRA COSTS THAT ARE EXTRAORDINARY TO THE GOVERNMENT IN PROVIDING SECURITY AND C. H. P. TAKE A AT PROVIDING THE ESCORT SERVICES TO PROVIDE CASH TO GO TO THE BANK SIX GREATEST SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT PROBLEM ONE OF THE ONE HAND THE VOTERS.

THERE WAS NO RUN ON OF ABUSE OF CANNABIS WE HEARD OF NO STORIES BUT WE UNDERSTOOD IT GAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT EXTRA TO CRIMINALIZE. BLACKAND BROWN PEOPLE IN THE FIRST TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE CONVICTED OF IT WORK WHAT BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY SO THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE. CANNABIS IS A PLANT.

THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I MEMBERS- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION AND I IN LISTENING TO THE COMMENTS SO FAR WAS SITTING THERE THINKING TO MYSELF. I HAVE TO ADMIT I'M I'M NINETY. BECAUSE I HAVE CONTINUE TO GO ALONG FROM BACK FROM YOU pKNOW BOTH CHILDHOOD MY HIGH SCHOOL DAYS COLLEGE DAYS AS AS I. BROUGH INTO VARIOUS PROFESSIONS THINKING THAT CERTAIN THINGS CERTAIN RIGHTS THAT WE ACHIEVED WE'RE JUST WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO BACKWARDS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HIM. SO I THINK ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE HI I REMEMBER BEING LAUDED BECAUSE BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO I WAS THE FIRST GIRL ELECTED TO MY STUDENT BODY PRESIDENCY MY HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN SHORTLY THEREAFTER NOT VERY MANY YEARS AFTER WE HAD WOMEN ASTRONAUTS WE HAD A WOMAN ON THE SUPREME COURT SO I JUST FIGURED OKAY WHAT BY THE TIME I WAS THE AGE I AM NOW WE NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANYMORE WOMEN'S FIRST BECAUSE- THERE'D BE WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN. READ NUMBERS ALL. THE IN EVERY. NOT SO. THEN OF COURSE RIGHTS I WATCHED AS A CHILD. CREDIBLE EFFORT TO RE SECURE VOTING RIGHTS THAT WERE GRANTED AFTER THE CIVIL WAR AND- I WATCH THE VIOLENCE THAT ENSUED AND OF COURSE THIS WEEKEND I WEN TO THE MARTIN LUTHER KING EVENTS AND THIS WAS THAT CONTINUED BY AND OF COURSE THE HONORING OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS NOT JUST A MATTER OF THE VICTORY OF VOTING RIGHTS BUT SO MANY OTHER THINGS TO SEVERAL CIVIL RIGHTS THAT WE NOW SEE BEING REVERSED. BUT WITH VOTING RIGHTS WE ARE SEEING COUNTIES AND STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY STRIPPING THOUSANDS OF VOTERS FROM THE ROLLS SO WE'RE HAVING TO RE FIGHT ALL OF THAT AND THEN HERE AGAIN I'M A FRESHMAN IN COLLEGE WHEN ROE VERSUS WADE.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR SKINNER ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. SENATOR WINNER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE RESOLUTION AND IN SUPPORT OF ROE V. WADE- ROE V. WADE IS SO CENTRAL TO OUR AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM- WHICH STAND FOR THE BASIC PROPOSITION THAT PEOPLE- IN THIS SOCIETY GET TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN LIVES INSTEAD OF HAVING OTHER PEOPLE MAKE THOSE DECISIONS FOR THEM- AND I WAS SAYS AS A GAY MAN WERE AND OUR COMMUNITY WE'VE BEEN TOLD FOR MANY YEARS WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO OR NOT DO WITH OUR BODIES. AS NONE OF ANYONE'S BUSINESS WHAT WE ARE USING FOR OUR OWN LIVES AND THE FACT THAT ANYONE WOULD TELL A WOMAN YOU MUST CARRY A PREGNANCY TO TERM I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU WONDER WHY YOUR SITUATION IS OR WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE FOR YOU TO HAVE A CHILD RIGHT NOW OR WHAT YOUR DOCTOR IS ADVISING YOU. IT'S A THAT WE'RE GONNA SAYS TELL YOU THAT ARE GOING TO BE FOR FORCED TO CARRY THAT BE TO TERM YOU'RE GOING TO BE FORCED. TO GIVE BIRTH TO THAT CHILD BY THAT DIE IS TO SO NONSENSICAL. AND THE OFFICER OF WHAT. ANYONE WOULD ADVOCATE FOR IN A FREE SOCIETY AND YOU KNOW WE MUST FIGHT TO PROTECT ROW WE HAVE- A VERY DANGEROUS APPEAL- IN THE US SUPREME COURT NOW JUNE MEDICAL SERVICES VERSUS KEY. THAT IF THE SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS THAT. LAW IN LOUISIANA IN LOUISIANA THERE WILL BE ZERO LOCATIONS IN THE STATE OF LOUISIANA WHERE A WOMAN CAN ACCESS ABORTION SERVICES AND WE WILL SEE THIS SPREAD AS WE ALREADY ARE. LIKE WILDFIRE ACROSS STATE WERE MOSTLY MEN. ARE DIRECTING WOMEN THAT THEY MUST GIVE BIRTH AND THEY CAN'T OF ACCESS TO THESE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES- WE KNOW THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SUPPORTS A RIGHT TO CHOOSE- AND WE MUST PROTECT ROW. THANK YOU.

THAT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE IS STILL UNDER ATTACK I AM SHOCKED THAT I'M FIFTY TWO YEARS OLD AND IT'S STILL AN ISSUE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT WILL CONTINUE MAKE SURE ALL WOMEN HAVE ACCESS. TO CHOICE AND ACCESS TO MAKING DECISIONS AND THEIR OWN BODY AND WE DO KNOW THAT 70% PLUS OF AMERICA'S AMERICAN SUPPORT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE SO WE CANNOT LET A MINORITY DICTATE WHAT A WOMAN CAN DO WITH HER OWN BODY.
