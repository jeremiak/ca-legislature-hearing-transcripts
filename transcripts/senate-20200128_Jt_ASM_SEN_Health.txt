TOGETHER AND TRYING TO THE PROP BASIC FIRST. NOW THAT. THE HOW SIZE MAKES. BEEN A LEGISLATIVE ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME BUT IN TOLD NOW IS MUCH BEEN FOCUSED ON THE STATE FOR HOSPITAL REMAINS. NOW THAT ALL ALL AND I DONE LOOKS BILL USUALLY BUT NOW THAT ALMOST ALL POSSIBLE TO MET THE STAND WE NOW START TURNING ATTENTION THEN UNDER THE HOUSE MOST. REMAIN OP CHANNEL A FOLLOWING IN. IT'S WHAT WE ARE FORTUNATE IN I'M ALWAYS WELL WE'VE HAD STILL HAD SOME EARTHQUAKES INSERT PARTS OF STATE HAVE BECAUSE US SERIOUS THE- REPORTS OF. SOME EVER TODAY'S THE POPE BEING FOR ZACH IN THE PORT ROLE HOSPITAL PLAY IN THE NBA OF KNOWLEDGE COURSE WILL BE GET BUT AS A PLACES WHERE CAN COORDINATE. RESPONSES BUT WELL WE HAVEN'T FOCUSES ON THE NEXT IT IS MY THIS IS. A TO HEAR FROM PADA OTHERS A EGGS WHAT IT TO REQUIRE HAAS TO RE OPERATION I WILL HEAR FROM SO LOCAL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS FOLLOW NATURAL DISASTER TO THE GUARD ARE ABLE TO BE FOUND IN THE IMPACT EMERGENCY RESPONSE WHEN A HOSPITAL NEEDS TO ACT YOU. LOOKING EFFECTIVE THE HOUSE OF THOSE WHO IN THE SKILLED TRADES PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY DO THE TO MAKE HOSPO EARTHQUAKE SAFE NOT MAKE NOTE TO I GUESS ONE OF CONFLICT POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF IN IS THAT IS A I DO IT ASIAN WORK IN HOUSE SO. IN MY- IN WATER IS NEED TO. IS RUNNING ARE HALF THE FOR BE SO WITH THAT LIKE TO BACK OVER TO THE CHAIR WOULD AND I FOR ROOM FROM OTHER MEMBERS SALUTE LASER ARE TO HAVE OTHER MAY WHO LIKE MAKE ANY ROOM THE ROOM. SEEING NONE NUMBER I THINK WE LET. WHICH PAUL COLEMAN WITH THE OFFICE OF STATE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT WHICH OVERSEES HOUSE SO BECOME TO GIVE US AN OVERVIEW OF THE TO REQUIRE AND COMPLY SO YOUR CALL. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON. LIKE TO TALK ABOUT. THE STATUS OF HOSTILE SIZING SAFETY TODAY AND THE REQUIREMENTS GOING FORWARD FIRST OF ALL MY NAME IS PAUL COLEMAN OF THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND- ARE THE OPPOSITE. MIGHT HELP. OF IS THE BUILDING. OF CALLED BUILDING APART. FOR HOSPITALS AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. AND SO WE START WITH WHY IS IT WISE HOSPITAL SEISMIC SAFETY IMPORTANT. AND THE LEGISLATURE'S FOUND THE PASSES IMPORTANT FOR THE SAFETY OF THE PATIENTS THE STAFF. AND THE VISITORS THAT ARE IN THOSE BUILDINGS. THIS ALSO PART HIGH RISK OF. PATIENT HARM WITH EVACUATION. OF THE MOST CRITICALLY KILL. ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE DEPEND ON LIFE SUPPORT. THOSE ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE ME ASSIST TO EARTH A TONES TIME WHEN THEY'RE NEEDED MOSTLY TO BE BE THERE FOR THEM. ZERO PLANS PROVIDE TERM SALUTE. THE ADDRESS IMMEDIATE. WHEN CARE FOR THOSE AFFECTED BY EVENT. IS IN THE HOSPITAL BUILDING UP AS A DISK CAN TAKE A DAY OR- THE DIGITAL STUFF SO REQUIRED- OF. REMOVAL BUT THEM AND DESTROYED BUILDING BEFORE CONSTRUCTION NO ONE. POSSIBLE POSSIBLE DELAYS INSURANCE OF FUNDING AND OTHER INSURANCES. PROLONGED OR EARTH RECOVERY IF IN EVERY LONG TERM ECONOMIC WELL BEING AS WELL AS ACCESS FOR THE COMMUNITY ONE SO MORE EARTHQUAKE ANOTHER. ALSO COLLAPSED. IN FIFTH DEATHS. THERE TWO ROWS OF THE ACT FINISH ACT AND THOSE WERE TO PREVENT LOSS OF LIFE. THE HOSPITALS WERE TO OPERATE AFTER AND- THE ONLY THE SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACT REQUIRED HOSPITAL BUILDING TO BE EXPLICITLY TIME AND REVIEWED FOR SIDE. AND WHILE 24% OR ALMOST A QUARTER OF THE TOP LEAGUES IN AFFECTED AREA A RED TAG IS A THE HE THANK THE POSTER WHEREAS BACK TO SHOWS THAT THE ACT WAS AFFECT. IN ORDER THE QUAKE WHICH AND SEND TWO OF THEM THE TO FACILITY OF PATEL'S. FOR COUNTIES RIGHT THANK YOU FOR TELLING. AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ECONOMIC LOSS THE ACT WAS AMENDED. SO THIS IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS SENATE BILL NINE TWO FIFTY THREE WHICH ALSO HAD. TO PHASES PHASE ONE. ACUTE CARE SERVICES FROM BUILDINGS THAT ARE RISK OF COLLAPSE. INITIALLY THERE WAS A TWO THOUSAND EIGHT DEADLINE- FOR THAT TO OCCUR. AND THEN THERE WAS EXTENSIONS TWENTY THIRTEEN AND SO WHEN EXTENSION OF AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER UP TO THE CURRENTLY WE HAVE EXTENSIONS ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FOR THAT FIRST PHASE. FOR THESE MEMBERS ARE OBLIGATED REGULATIONS THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. UPON APPROVAL THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION. UNDER THESE REGULATIONS OFFER CREATED STRUCTURAL AND NONSTRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES. AS WITH THE ACT SO ALTURAS HOOKER BUILDINGS ARE SIGNED BOTH A STRUCTURAL AND A NON STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE CATEGORY. THE STRUCTURE CATEGORIES RANGE FROM VERY- MAY BE AT RISK OF COLLAPSE IN A STRONG EARTHQUAKE. THE HIGHEST LEVEL THAT INDICATES BUILDINGS ARE REASONABLY CAPABLE OF PROVIDING SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC FOLLOWING A STRONG EARTHQUAKE. THERE ARE SIX STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES FOR HOSPITAL BUILDINGS AS PC ONE BUILDINGS ARE THOSE AT RISK OF COLLAPSE IN A STRONG EARTHQUAKE. AS WE SEE TO BILLINGS DO NOT SIGNIFICANT JEOPARDIZE LIFE BUT MAY NOT BE REPAIRABLE OR FUNCTIONAL. FOLLOWING A STRONG EARTHQUAKE. AS WE EE THREE FOUR FORTY AND FIVE BUILDINGS. ARE REASONABLY CAPABLE OF PROVIDING SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC AFTER NOTS EARTHQUAKE. AS OF DECEMBER TWENTY FOUR TWENTY NINETEEN THERE WERE THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT ACUTE CARE BUILDINGS ON FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN CAMPUSES. THAT WERE SUBJECT TO THE ACT HOSTILE CAMPUS THE TYPICALLY COMPRISED OF MULTIPLE BUILDINGS. SO EVERY BUILDING ON THE CAMPUS THAT PROVIDES A TO CARE SERVICES MUST COMPLY WITH THE SEISMIC SAFETY ACT. UNDER FORTY SEVEN BUILDINGS OR FOUR POINT SEVEN OF THE TOTAL BUILDINGS. ARE CURRENTLY RATED AT SPC ONE OR COLLAPSE HAZARD. CONVERSELY THAT MEANS THAT MORE THAN 95% OF THE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN CHANGED FROM THAT CLASSIFICATION TWO SPC TWO OR TWO OR HIGHER CLASSIFICATION- INDICATING THAT THE HOSPITAL INDUSTRY HAS DONE A GOOD JOB AT MOVING THOSE BUILDINGS. OUT OF THAT CATEGORY. THE DEADLINE TO THE NEXT LEVEL WHEREAS PC TWO WAS ORIGINALLY TO A TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. AND LATER WITH SIX INCHES ALSO SET UP TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THERE ARE SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX BUILDINGS CURRENTLY THAT ARE RATED. AS PC TO. THAT IS A TWENTY POINT 6% OF THE HOSPITAL BILLING INVENTORY. THESE BUILDINGS MAY OFFER TO CARE SERVICES UP TO TWENTY THIRD BUT OUR NOTE AND NO LONGER PROVIDE ACUTE CARE SERVICES GOING BEYOND TWENTY THIRTY. FINALLY THERE ARE TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE BUILDINGS OR SEVENTY FOUR POINT SEVEN ALMOST THREE QUARTERS OF THE HOSPITAL BUILDINGS. ARE RATED SPC THREE FOUR FORTY OR FIVE. AND THEY ARE STRUCTURE COMPLIANT BUILDINGS THAT OFFER KIDS. IT WAS THE TWENTY THIRD. IN ADDITION TO THE STRUCTURE STANDARDS ARE FIVE NONSTRUCTURAL STANDARDS. THESE ARE CALLED NON STRUCTURE PERFORMANCE CATEGORY CLASSIFICATIONS. AND WHAT NONSTRUCTURAL NEEDS ARE THOSE SYSTEMS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO PATIENT CARE. AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE SUCH AS THE HVAC OR THE MECHANICAL HEATING AND COOLING IN VIOLATION SYSTEMS- MEDICAL GAS THE STORAGE SO IT. IS THE POWER. FUEL STORAGE. TEMPLES WILL OF WHAT WOULD BE NON STRUCTURAL ISSUES. IN ALL BUILDINGS MOSTLY IN PC FOUR OR FORTY AND FIVE BY TWENTY THIRTY. ABOUT A 30% OF THE GENERAL TO CARE BUILDINGS MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY STANDARD FOR MPC FOUR OR FIVE TODAY. I WAS ALSO ASKED TO BRIEFLY DESCRIBE OFFERS EMERGENCY EVENT RESPONSE. ARSENAL FACILITIES DEVELOPMENT VISION PROVIDE SUPPORT AND EXPERTISE IN THE EVENT OF AN EARTHQUAKE FAULT OR OTHER DISASTER. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA STATE MERCY PLAN OUR SPOT PROVIDES RAPIDLY MUCH THE STRUCTURAL FIRE LIFE SAFETY AND CRITICAL BUILDING SYSTEMS INSPECTIONS OF HOSPITALS AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. OFTEN STAFF CONDUCT POST DISASTER BUILDING INSPECTIONS THE TERM CARE WHETHER BUILDING SAFE FOR CONTINUED- FUNCTIONAL- OPERATION SERVICES. AND CRITICAL BUILDING SYSTEMS THE FUNCTIONALITY. ARE WE ALSO POSED VISIBLE TAGS RED YELLOW OR GREEN ON THE BUILDINGS AFTER OUR INSPECTION TO INDICATE WHERE THE BUILDING THE FOR OCCUPANCY OR HAS LIMITED USE OR IS UNSUITABLE FOR USE OR OPERATION AT ALL. SURE HAVE TO HEALTH THAT IS UNDER OUR FUNDERS BE. IT BECAUSE OF A OR HAS JUST. THE BILL MUST BE INSPECTED BY OUR FRAUD PRIOR. TO THE BILLING BEING USED OR REOCCUPIED. ALL FOUR CORNERS INSPECTIONS WITH THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE AFFECTED FACILITIES. POST IS ASTER OFF OUR PRODUCT CAUSES THE APPROVAL AND PERMITTING OF REPAIR AND RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS FOR HOSPITAL FACILITIES AFFECTED BY THE DISASTER TO EXPEDITE THE RESTORATION. OF THE SERVICES AND SERVICE TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. OSWALD RESPONDED TO TEN DISASTERS IN TWENTY NINETEEN. INCLUDING WILD FIRES EARTHQUAKES IN POWER SHUT OFFS. THE BASIC OPERATING PRINCIPLE FOR ALZHEIMER'S RESPONSE IS TO SHELTER IN PLACE IF IT IS SAFE TO DO SO. TERRESTRES ALL STATES IN THE COMMAND STRUCTURE. EVAPORATION SO UNSAFE OR HOUSES HOSPITAL KILL NURSING RED TAGGED BUILDINGS REQUIRE RESOURCES FROM THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AUTHORITY THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES SERVICES. SUCH AS AMBULANCES AIR TRANSPORT MEDICAL PERSONNEL MEDICATIONS AND EQUIPMENT AND WILL JUST DROP ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IN ACTED AREAS. THAT CONCLUDES MY- I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. I THINK THIS COLEMAN. I THINK VERY MUCH- HAD SEVERAL QUESTIONS- BUT- AND APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION- SO FIRST OF ALL BUT OKAY SO FIRST OF ALL AND IN YOUR CHARTS AND THE- DO YOU PROVIDE. I PRESUME THAT THE PERCENTAGES ARE BASED ON THE NUMBER FACILITY NOT TERMS OF NUMBER AND SO WITH DOLLARS IN. IN TERMS. THESE ARE STATEWIDE- IN TERMS OF ACTUAL TOTAL BED COMPOUND THE THAT'S TIED IT THAT'S IN EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT. CATEGORIES IS. THAT IS THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE AT THIS TIME BECAUSE HOSPITALS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT TO US TO WHAT'S HIS ARE IN EACH BILL EACH OF THE PHONES OKAY. NOT NECESSARILY NO SERVICE LEARNING GOING OR THOSE REMOTE EACH OF THESE BUILDING AS FAR AS CLASSIC. AND OKAY SO I WOULD THINK AND- PERHAPS MAYBE. WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION THE HOSPITAL TO SEE ABOUT HOW IT SO YOU SAY YOU DON'T WE GET THAT AT ALL. WE WILL. NOT A- ONE LIMITED BUILDING THERE WAS A BILL SENATE BILL FOR NINETY NINE. THAT REQUIRED HOSPITALS THAT WERE STILL OF SPC ONE BUILDINGS AT THAT TIME. INDICATE WAS SERVICES WHEN THEIR BUILDINGS BUT IT WAS A FAIRLY SMALL SUBSET OF TOTAL BUILDINGS. OF ALL OF. THIS SO I. I WOULD BE PARTICULARLY. PER GEOGRAPHIC AREA SO YOU ONE YES SENSE OF. IN A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF THOSE AN EARTHQUAKE EXACTLY WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE ACTUAL CLINICAL CAPACITY WOULD BE AFFECTED BECAUSE- BILL YEARS DEPENDING ON WHAT'S UNDER DAY ARE THEY ARE AT AT THE TIME- SO I'M HOPING WE CAN ACCESS. AND INFORMATION WE CAN GET THAT OUT AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT. MAKING NOTE THAT A 20% OF HOSPITAL BUILDINGS ARE SPC TWO AND WILL PRIME NEED EITHER RETROFIT TO S. B. C. FOUR D. OR BE REPLACED BY NEW BUILDING CAN YOU MAYBE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S INVOLVED RETROFITTING OF BUILDING FROM S. P. TWO TWO FORTY- DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE IS WHAT. IS REPLACE THE BUT IF YOU WERE TO IT I NEED YOU HAVE. A BUILDING TO GET TO BECAUSE- ACTUAL THING HOW HOW MUCH OF IS A TO GET A BUILDING FOR ESPYS TO SB C. FORTY. WELL THAT WAS VERY BUILDING SPECIFIC- FOR NUMBER REASONS. WE HAVE SPC TWO BUILDINGS THAT WERE BUILT- BACK IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS WE HAVE ONE THAT'S BUILT IN NINETEEN OH TWO FOR EXAMPLE- SO THESE ARE HAVE A QUITE A- OF TIME THAT THESE. BUILDINGS WERE CONSTRUCTED UNDER ALL OF THE BUILDINGS CONCERT TO. ACT I HAVE TO DIFFERENT PLEASE WELL IT DEPENDS ON HOW MANY STRUCTURE DEFICIENCIES A PARTICULAR BUILDING HAS. KIND AS HOW MUCH NEED TO BE MADE THOSE BUILDINGS GOVIA TWENTY AT THIS TIME THE- SOME OF THE MAY ACTUALLY SOME OF SOME BUILDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN TO BECOME SPC FORTY WITH ANY STRUCTURAL WORK AT ALL JUST SHARPENING THEIR PENCILS AND SHOWING THAT THE BUILDING I WORK AS IS- THAT IS NOT THE CASE FOR THE MEN IN THE PUBLIC MOST OLDER IT CHOOSE THE BILL. OPPOSED TO THE- ORDER TO MOVE THE SERVICES TO DIFFERENT BILL. THAN THEIR OWN MOST LIKELY BE SOME WORK INVOLVED BUT WHAT WE'RE ALSO FINDING OUT IS THAT IS HOSPITALS DO THIS WORK. THEY REALIZE THAT IS IT'S A GOOD TIME TO START REPLACING INFRASTRUCTURE THOSE ARE AGING- UGH I'M THE IT ALSO REALLY FALL. IN BRING THE POSSIBLE UP TO MORE MODERN HEALTHCARE CAPABILITIES- NEWER EQUIPMENT- BECAUSE OF THAT NATURE SO. SOMETIMES TO PARSE HOW MUCH OF THAT. IS I SEISMIC RELATED AND HOW MUCH IS BECAUSE THE HOSPITAL HAS OTHER. REASONS FOR DOING THE DIGITAL WORKS WITH THE FORM AT THE SAME TIME. ALSO THERE IS A QUORUM THAT AS A DO THIS WORK. IF THE BUILDING DOES NOT CURLY MEET ALL OF THE STATE'S ACCESSIBILITY STANDARDS FOR WHAT THE BUILDINGS. MUST ALSO CORPORATE THE WORK. WITH THE COST. SO IT'S DIFFICULT- IT'S LIKE A SEA TO GIVE US AN ACTUAL COSTS ON A PER BASS BECAUSE EVERY. I WILL BE HAVE NOT REQUIREMENTS. PLEASE BE ON THE WHOLE LIFE LOCATION THE BUILDING SINCE I ARE MORE SEISMICALLY PRONE OTHER LOW. ALSO IF YOU'RE RIGHT ON SENATOR THIS FALL YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A MUCH HIGHER STANDARD TO MEET THEN IF YOU'RE IN A VERY LOW SEISMIC SONG OKAY SO JUST TO CLEAR THANKS THAT'D YOUR LAST REMARK. YOU MAY NOTICE. DIFFERENT DO HAVE- DIFFERENT SEISMIC RISK SELL FOR EXAMPLE BEING HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I'LL BE A FAULT SON YOU KNOW TO THE EAST TO THE WEST BUT NO OVER MORE WITH A FLOOD HERE VERSES WITH THE BUILDING THE EFFORTS TO GO AREN'T OTHER. ISMS SO IN TERMS OF THE- DEANDRE SINCE THE SEISMIC REQUIREMENTS TODAY ACTUALLY TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE SEISMIC RISK SO IT'S THIS SO IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT IF YOU BUILT A HOSPITAL ONE LOCATION VERSUS ANOTHER LOCATION YES SIR PART OF THE- OF. THE VALUATION THAT MUST BE MADE BY THE HOSPITAL STRUCTURE ENGINEER IS BASED ON. THE ACTUAL LOCATION THE SEISMICITY OF THE LOCATION SO A BUILDINGS THAT'S IN A LOWER SEISMIC ZONE OR OR LOCATION THEN WILL HAVE A LOWER BASE YOUR- REQUIREMENT OR LOW REQUIREMENT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH. THAT A BUILDING THAT IS LOCATED AND THEY ARE HIGHER SEISMIC ZONE. I SAW THE AD STANDARD TO WHAT HE DOES BILL I CHANGE VICE LOCATION OKAY. ALL RIGHT. AND THEN. YOU HOSPITAL BUILDINGS ARE ONLY S. PC THREE INSTEAD OF FOUR FIVE HAVE A GREATER CHALLENGE IN MEETING THE HIGHER LEVELS OF THE NPC REQUIREMENTS SO YET STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS NONSTRUCTURAL CRIMES STAR NEEDED BY TWENTY THIRTY. WELL IS IT OKAY WE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE OFFICE DID WAS IN THE TWENTY. SIXTEEN CODE WE INTRODUCED A NEW. CATEGORY OF NONSTRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE CALLED IN PC FORTY RIGHT AND THAT ONE IS VERY SIMILAR TO PC THREE WITH WITH ACTUALLY SOME ITEMS MOVED. SAMPLE UNDER IN THE PC PREVIOUSLY- THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT CABINETS IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS HAD TO BE. ANCHORED SUCH MATTER TO THE WALLS WHICH WOULD REQUIRE REMOVING THESE CABINETRY- DURING OPEN. PUTTING FRAMING AND INPUT LET'S BACK AND SO- WHAT WE CONCLUDED WAS THAT. IF THE CAT IS BUILT ON THE WALL NOW FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS IS. AND THAT THAT WAS COSTS THAT MAY NOT NEED TO BE SPENT. SO THAT'S WHAT KIND OF PRODUCT IN PC FORTY- BECAUSE WE HAD A NUMBER OF YEARS BEHIND US NOW TO SEE WHAT WAS PRACTICAL BECAUSE LOSSES WHATEVER'S PRACTICAL SOCKS. WE HAD A SENSE OF SOMETIME TO DETERMINE WHAT WE'RE IT'S REALLY PRACTICAL TO BE DONE SO WE SAID IF. I'M NOT. ALL IN. IN A PATIENT WITH. BILL WOULD BLOCK A RE. EXCEPT THEN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IT'S AN COULD PROPERLY OTHERWISE. BECOME IT'S GOOD TO GO. THAT'S EXAMPLE OKAY AND SO- WE HAVE MADE SOME. LIKE SEE SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES. TO MAKE THOSE TO THOSE MORE COST EFFECTIVE FOR ALL SPC CATEGORIES ACROSS THE BOARD. OKAY PRECIADO AND THEN FINALLY- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE- THE- NBC REQUIREMENTS. AS WE KNOW AS WITH MY- YOUR HOSPITAL EIGHT AND IT'S CONNECT. TO ELECTRICAL LINES SEWER LINES WATER LINES BECAUSE AFTER ALL HOSPITALS NOT. AN ISLAND RIGHT AT. THE EXIT RIGHT. TO WHAT HERMANCE NOW IF YOU AN EARTHQUAKE THOSE THE COULD BE DISRUPT THEMSELF SO IT'S NOT WITHIN THE HOSPITAL IT'S THE CONNECTIONS TO THE HOSPITAL'S SO HE JUST SPEAK TO GIVEN THE STANDARDS OF A HOSPITAL OF YOU HAVE THAT EARTHQUAKE THAT HAPPENS NOW THE SEWER LINES IS DISRUPTED WATER LINES ARE DISRUPTED COLLINES OTHER THINGS. IT'LL IS STILL EXPECT TO OPERATE ON ITS OWN LIKE INDEPENDENTLY WITHOUT THOSE CONNECTIONS ARE WE CAN CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS. ALL FOR THE HOSPITAL TO BE ABLE TO DO AN EVENT THAT THERE'S DAMAGE I MEAN OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT LEADS TO THE HOSPITAL PROVIDING SERVICES. YES SIR. OF NBC FIVE ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE AND THAT'S WHY SO BY TWENTY THIRTY ALL HOSPITALS HAVE TO BE IN PC FIVE. M. WHAT IS REQUIRED IS FOR EXAMPLE FOR FUEL FOR THE GENERATORS- THEY MUST HAVE SOME OF THE TWO HOURS A FEW ON HAND- THEY MUST HAVE STORAGE OF WATER- FOR PATIENTS STAFF AND VISITORS LIMITS HAVE STORED CAPABILITY. OF DEALING WITH THE BOYS STORY. BECAUSE THE SEWER LINES AS YOU SAID MAY BE BROKEN OR OR AND NOT USABLE- SO THE A TEN AS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE AND WHATEVER'S PRACTICAL IT TO MAKE SURE THE HOSPITAL CANNOT RATE- BEYOND THE- THE EVENT- IF THOSE OTHER SERVICES THEY BECOME. DISABLED OR NOT AVAILABLE OKAY SO THE EIGHT SO THE CONCEPT IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL THAT A HOSPITAL SHOULD BE OF THE OPERATIONAL FOR SOMETHING SOME TWO. IN ICE. AND SORT YES. WITH THE I. THAT I TWO THE NAFTA. IT'S REACHED. OTHER MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS. I'M I DO SO I DON'T KNOW PLEASE ADVICE ONE GIVE. TO RUN AWAY YET PLEASE- SO A COUPLE QUESTIONS A PERSONAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND APPRECIATE- DOCTOR PANTS QUESTIONS AS WELL- SO HOW DOES THE UPDATE HAS BUILDING CODE UPDATES THAT HAPPEN EVERY THREE YEARS A FACT- THIS PROCESS AND IN SEISMIC SAFETY FOR HOSPITALS. WELL AS I MENTIONED WE LOOK AT- WHAT APPROACHES CAN BE TAKEN. TO BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE FOR HOSPITALS TO COMPLY AND THROUGH THIS APPROACH- THERE WE HAVE HAD- HAS THIS INTRODUCED. WHICH IS A PROGRAM THAT WAS- CREATED INITIALLY BY FEMA. AND WE'VE ALSO- INTRODUCED AS PC FORTY- IN PC FORTY AND OTHERS AND WE DO THOSE THROUGH REGULATIONS- THROUGH THE BILLING CENTERS COMMISSION AND THERE IS A LIKE YOU SAID A THREE YEAR CYCLE THEN THERE'S AN INTRO EIGHTEEN MONTH CYCLE THAT WE CAN CATCH UP ON THINGS BUT- HOUSE AS- BILLS HAVE BEEN PASSED REGARDING HOSPITAL CITING SAFETY- SOMETIMES. THERE'S BEEN AN URGENCY AD THAT SUCH THAT THE BILL HAS. ALLOWED US ARE PROVIDED- US TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS WHICH CAN BE DONE OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL. THREE YEAR CYCLE. BUT WE WOULD LOOK AT THE- EVENTS THAT HAPPENED FOR EXAMPLE AND KATRINA. THEY HAD ISSUES WITH GENERATORS BECAUSE THEY WERE IN THE FLOOD PLAIN. SO IS RESULT THAT WE PUT IN OUR BUILDING ABOUT. THAT ELEVATOR. DOLLARS I'M SORRY GENERATOR SO. HAVE YOU CANNOT BE IN THE FLOOD PLAIN THAT THEY HAD TO BE ABOVE THE FLOOD PLAIN. SO THAT IS ON THE BUILDING CODE- THE FIRE AND ALL THAT. THE BILL IS A HUNDRED OUTSIDE ERROR NOT HAVE THE PEOPLE OF SHUTTING SMALL FROM COMING THE BUILDINGS. SO WE'VE DOES ALLOW THAT AND THE CODE GOING FORWARD SO AS THESE- EMERGENCIES AND THESE- DISASTERS OCCUR. THERE WE DO LOOK AT ARE THE CODES- ADEQUATE TO COVER. THOSE EVENTS AND IF SO IF NOT THEN WE WILL- PUBLIC- CODE CHANGES TO THE BILLING CENTERS COMMISSION. SO WHEN HOSPITALS RETROFITTING AS OPPOSED TO A REBUILDING. OUR THE SEISMIC- COMPLIANCE STANDARDS DIFFERENT- BASED ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HOSPITAL OR WHAT'S BEEN RETROFITTED FOR EXAMPLE. MY DISTRICT IS RURAL. A LOT OF ONE IN TWO STORY WOODEN STRUCTURES- WITH THE RETROFIT REQUIREMENTS BASED ON. CURRENT CONSTRUCTION IN WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE FOR. THE DIFFERENCE AND WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT A LOT OF SKYSCRAPERS IN MY DISTRICT. YES YOUR CORRECT THAT NEVER BUILDINGS HAVE DIFFERENT BILL. AND DIFFERENT STRUCTURE DEFICIENCIES AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE. A SIX ESPECIALLY SINGLE STORY WOOD FRAME STRUCTURES HAVE FARED A FAIRLY WELL DURING EARTQUAKES AND NOT THAT MANY KNOWS THE THOSE- HAVE COLLAPSED- IN AND SO TO THAT EXTENT OF WHAT THE OFFICE IS PROPOSING TO DO. IS TO LOOK AT THOSE KINDS OF STRUCTURES THE AND SEE IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO SOME OF LIKE- RESIDENTIAL THERE ARE SOME PRESCRIPTIVE STANDARD RESIDENCES RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION TO MEET. THE STANDARDS COULD WE COME UP WITH SOME PRESCRIPTIVE STANDARDS FOR THESE KIND OF BUILDINGS SO THAT THEY CAN- DO IT ON A LESS COSTLY. MORE COST EFFECTIVE MANNER. TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT THESE BUILDINGS MAKE SURE. FOR BETTER AND THERE'S SOME. SUPPOSED TO A- NON DOCTOR CON THE OLD OF. MULTI STOREY BUILDING OR OTHER BILL THAT APPEARED BE MORE FRAGILE DURING AN EARTHQUAKE AND HAVE MORE STRUCTURAL DAMAGE. WELL THE X. I. BREAK BRING THAT UP BUT WHAT WHAT OUR PANELISTS TODAY'S FROM MAD RIVER HOSPITAL IN IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY AND- THAT AREA OF THE HUMBLE COAST IS EXPERIENCE TO THE TOP TEN. EARTHQUAKES IN THE LAST TWENTY THIRTY FIFTY YEARS WHATEVER I'M ACTUALLY SINCE PROBABLY SINCE THE BUILDING OF A HOSPITAL. IN THEAT THE HOSPITAL REMAIN STANDING FIFTY PLUS YEARS LATER IT MADE ME THINK ABOUT YOUR CABINET ON THE WALL. AND WONDERING YOU KNOW WITH WITH WITH HISTORIES LIKE THAT IN CERTAIN AREAS WE ALSO KNOW SEISMIC EVENTS OR OR HAPPEN IN MULTIPLE WAYS IT COULD BE A SPECIALTY COULD BE SLOW ROLLING THERE'S ALL SORTS OF THESE THINGS. AND SO YOU KNOW WE LOOKING AT YOUR RURAL COMMUNITIES AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE A HOSPITAL BECAUSE YOU'RE POSSIBLE CAN OF. RETRO WE- YEAH I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO SAY ANYTHING ON THIS BUT I DO WONDER SOMETIMES A WEEK. REMAKE A JOB AT THAT. THAT THAT THAT CAN MAY NOT HAVE A HA. IN BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T POSSIBLY AFFORD IT- IS AND THAT'S THAT'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING WILL HAVE TO. GRAPPLE WITH AND IN OUR WORLD BUT I KNOW IN MY DISTRICT- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SINGLE STORY WOODEN STRUCTURES AND I KNOW THEY ALL FAIR DIFFERENTLY. IN SEISMIC EVENTS AND SO I JUST MY HOPE IS THAT THAT THERE IS SOME- REALISTIC LOOK AT THAT TIME. TECH IS A NICE GUY. HE IS. IT IN SOME PLACES WE DON'T EVEN HAVE ELEVATORS AND CITIES BECAUSE- THEY DON'T WORK. YEAH THEY WORK BUT- WE DON'T NEEDED SOME OKAY THANK YOU BUT I THINK THE PRESSURE. ANY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER COMPETITION OKAY SO WE'RE GONNA BE UP OUR NEXT PANEL ON STATE LOCAL AGENCY RESPONSIBILITIES- SO PLEASED TO HAVE HEIDI'S US NINE NINE ACRE THAT'S CORRECTLY A DEFEAT DIRECTOR CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY CALVET APART PUBLIC HEALTH WELCOME AND BRIAN HENDRIX AND PRESIDENT OF THE U. S. IN STRAIGHT SETS XIN CALIFORNIA. WELL LOOK FOR TO YUR PRESENTATIONS. AND IF YOU CAN AND WILL I'M SURE PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS SO WE ASK IF YOU CAN TRY TO KEEP YOUR PRESENTATIONS OF THREE MINUTES APPRECIATED. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS HEIDI STEIN OCCUR AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND I WAS ASKED TO SPEAK HERE ON AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT OUR RESPONSE IS INTIMATE AND EVENTS OF EMERGENCY FROM C. PH. SO CITY PH WORKS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH- YES IN OUR SPOT IN THE HOSPITAL PROVIDERS DURING EMERGENCY EVENTS TO DETERMINE THE SAFE OPTION FOR THE FACILITIES STAFF PATIENTS AND COMMUNITY. FIRST AND FOREMOST OUR PRIMARY GOAL IS TO MAINTAIN AS MUCH ACCESS TO SAVE HEALTHCARE AS POSSIBLE. AXIS IS CRITICAL BOTH DURING THE EVENT AND AFTER THE EVENT. SO THE OPTIONS WE CONSIDER IN THIS ORDER. ARE ONE FIRST AND FOREMOST SHELTER IN PLACE TO REMAIN ACCESS AND SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY. TO A PARTIAL EVACUATION TO SPECIFIC LINES OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES- THIS LAST SUMMER- FOR THE JULY IF YOU REMEMBER WE HAD A HOSPITAL RIDGECREST. WAS AFFECTED BY THE- EARTHQUAKE AND THAT IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF A PARTIAL EVACUATION WHERE THE EMERGENCY ROOM WAS PRONE TO VERSION THE HOSPITAL'S EVENTUALLY EVACUATED BUT THE DISTINCT PARTS NET FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. REMAINED TRAIN AND PLACE IN PART TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PATIENTS WERE NOT TRANSFERRED SOMETIMES TRANSPLANT PATIENTS ACTUALLY CAUSES MORE HARM. AND THE LAST BUT NOT LEAST OUR LAST OPTION TO TAKE IS A FULL DIVERSION AND OR EVACUATION OF THE FACILITY. THE FACTORS THAT WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ARE ONE THE ACUITY LEVEL OR THE LEVEL OF- TYPES OF PATIENTS THE AMOUNT OF PATIENTS IN THE HOSPITAL OR AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. I MEAN ARE THEY AMPLE TORY- SELF CAPABLE OF SELF PRESERVATION- OR NON AMBULATORY THIS OR DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT THAT NEEDS TO FOLLOW THEM OTHER CORPSMAN QUORUM ABILITIES OR THINGS THAT COULD HARM THEM. IN TRANSFERRING. YOU LOOK AT THE DEMOGRAPHIC REGION RURAL VERSUS URBAN WE'RE LOOKING AT DISTANCE TO OTHER FACILITIES TAKES STELLAR. WE'RE LOOKING AT A- IN ALL FOR TRANSPORT AND HOW THIS AFFECTS SINCE THE SERVICES IN THE AREA. THE NEXT THING WE REVIEW IS A FACTOR TYPE OF EVENT AND THE RISK LEVEL OF IF THERE COULD BE MORE FURTHER FOR THREATS TO THE FACILITY OF THE COMMUNITY. IN THE CASE OF AN EARTHQUAKE YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF EXTRA AFTERSHOCKS RIGHT NOW WE ARE DEALING WITH INFECTIOUS OUTBREAKS WE ALSO OF COURSE DEAL OF FIRES FLOODS ACTIVE SHOOTERS ALL OF THESE ARE HANDLED CASE CASE BECAUSE OF THE TO IT. WE THEN. IN TO AYE NORMALLY REACH OUT DIRECTLY THE CEO OF A FACILITY. AND DISCUSS WITH THE FACILITY SITUATION IS. WHAT TYPES OF DAMAGE HAVE A SUSTAINED. AND I WORK WITH US PUT IN THE DESERT IN DETERMINING. THE ABILITY TO BE THERE QUICKLY FIX THE DAMAGE OR FIND OTHER ALTERNATE SPACES THAT CAN BE COMPLIANCE. WE I TALK ABOUT STAFFING SUPPLIES AND WHAT IS THE EMOTIONAL TENER OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT MEANING. ARE THERE STAFF AFRAID TO COME IN OTHER STAFF TWENTY TO BE WITH THEIR FAMILIES AT THIS TIME. UP WITH THE COMMUNITY SITUATION HOW CATASTROPHIC WAS THE EVENT DID IT HIT SEVERAL FACILITIES ALL AT ONCE AND IF SO WE NEED A TRIAGE THE FACILITIES TO WHICH ONES CAN REMAIN STANDING OPEN. TO YOUR QUESTION EARLIER YOU ASKED ABOUT WATER IF EVERYONE LOST WATER BUT THESE TWO HOSPITALS HAVE ENOUGH WATER TO BE ABLE TO- COME UP WITH OTHER OPTIONS THEN WE WORK WITH THAT. SAID DEPENDS ON THE SITUATION OF HOW WIDESPREAD- THIS EVENT CAUSES- THINGS TO BE DISABLED. WE LOOK AT HOW MANY AVAILABLE FACILITIES AND OUR COMMUNITY SPACES SHELTERS CAN BE CREATED OR USED. ACCESS TO CARE OPTIONS FOR PATIENTS IN NEARBY COMMUNITIES THE EVENT OF- THE RECENT FIRES WE OFFER WILL COME UP WITH MAKESHIFT SHELTERS IN THE COMMUNITY AND WE'RE WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS- AND THE PROVIDERS TO TRANSPORT. THIS PATIENT SAFELY. SEE THE PAGE FOR THE FACILITY ON ANY SUPPLY STAFFING OR ASSESSMENT NEEDS AND SEND A TEAM OF TRAINED STAFF TO THE LOCATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IF AT ANY POINT PARTIAL OR FULL DIVERSION AND OR EVACUATION OCCURS CD PEACH WORKS IN CONCERT WITH THE FACILITY EMSA AND LOCAL COUNTY HEALTH OFFICERS AND SPECIFIC NEEDS TRANSPORT PLANTS AND COMMUNICATES CONSTANTLY THE C. PH MEDICAL HEALTH COORDINATION CENTER. WAS WITHOUT THE AND EIGHT CC. THE MAC'S HE PLAYS A COORDINATING ROLE IN EMERGENCY EVENTS WITH THOSE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE ADDRESSING THE MEDICAL NEEDS OF THE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. AND THE CENTER CLOSELY WITH THE STATE. AGENCY OPERATIONS WITH A LOW MARGINS PERSONNEL. AGAIN MAINTAINING ACCESS- AND PRESERVING SERVICES. WORKS CREATIVELY WITH FACILITIES AN ARCH PART IN FINDING UNIQUE SOLUTIONS TO EACH SITUATION IN SOME CASES THIS RESULT IN CRAFTING AND APPROVING TEMPORARY TITLE TWENTY TWO REGULATION PROGRAM FLEXES TO FIND ALTERNATE MEANS OF SAFETY COMPLIANCE. CAJUN OUR SPOT STAFF WORK TOGETHER ON SITE AND RE POPULATING AFTER AN EVENT FOR THE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES TO ENSURE SERVICES CAN BE CONTINUED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. CONSIDERATIONS AGAIN FOR FULL PARTIAL ARE PHASED IN RE POPULATION INCLUDE REMOVING THE TO EAT DIVERSION- WORKING UP STAFFING LEVELS AGAIN INTERNAL SYSTEMS UTILITIES. AND FACILITY SPACES SUPPLIES COMMUNITY NEED AND DISTANCE TO NEXT FACILITY TYPE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT'S WHAT THIS. A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS BRIAN HENDRIX AND I AM THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATOR AND NAPA COUNTY AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. REPRESENTING THE THIRTY THREE LOCAL EMS AGENCIES FROM AROUND THE STATE. LIKE MANY OF MY EMS ADMINISTRATOR COLLEAGUES AYE AYE SIR IS THE MEDICAL HEALTH OPERATIONAL AREA COORDINATOR FOR NAPA COUNTY WILL LOCAL STATUTORY RESPONSE FOR PLANNING AND READ. TO AND HEALTH RELATED AMONG THESE DISASTERS WITHIN OUR COUNTIES OR OPERATIONAL AREAS. THIS RESPONSIBILITY INCLUDES PLANNING FOR IN RESPONSE TO CATASTROPHIC EARTHQUAKES. MY GOAL IS TO SHARE OF RULE COUNTIES EXPERIENCE AS IT RELATES TO DISASTER RESPONSE. THE SOUTH NAPA EARTHQUAKE STRUCK. MY COMMUNITY IN AUGUST OF TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND WHILE THE EARTHQUAKE DID COST MEXICAN DAMAGE IN OUR COMMUNITY WE WERE FORTUNATE THAT THE EVENT DID NOT CAUSE MAJOR DAMAGE TO EITHER. OF OUR LOCAL HOSPITAL AGAIN IN A RURAL COUNTY. THROUGHOUT THE AND OUR HOSPITALS WERE ABLE TO CONTAIN THE SERVICES THAT THEY WERE ALREADY PROVIDING AND WE'RE ALSO ABLE TO QUICKLY RAMP. THEIR SERVICE AND PROVIDE CARE TO KLAY IT'LL END IN THE HOURS THAT ALLOWED THAT EVENT. HOUSE AND LOCAL MASS EIGHT ARE KEY PARTNER AND- FOR. INCLUDING SEISMIC EVENTS. THIS COORDINATION INCLUDES PARTICIPATION AND LOCAL HEALTH CARE COALITIONS THROUGH THE FEDERAL AND STATE HOSPITAL PREPAREDNESS PROGRAM AND PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PROGRAMS. THE MEDICAL AND HEALTH RESPONSE TO LARGE EARTHQUAKES IS COMPLEX AND REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT RISK RESPONSE RESOURCES. FOR THIS REASON OUR DISASTER PLANNING RELIES ON OUR HOSPITALS SURVIVING EARTHQUAKES EARTHQUAKE OF BANDS AND BEING ABLE TO MAINTAIN ALL OF THEIR DAY TO DAY FUNCTIONS. HI BILLS THAT EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT. OR WE ARE TO SHUT DOWN SERVICE LINES ARE LIKELY REQUIRE IT WILL ALSO LIKELY REQUIRE EVACUATION OF SOME OR ALL OF THEIR PATIENTS. BECOME PART OF SERIES. POSSIBLE EVACUATIONS RICK SIGNIFICANT PATIENT PLANNING RESOURCES REDUCING THE AVAILABILITY OF THOSE SOURCE AND THE COMMUNITY AND ALSO TACTIC. THE MURDER THE THAT THANK YOU. OUTSIDE OF THE IN AREA. NO FOR. THE PEOPLE OF TRANCE TO LOCAL FOLLOWING EARTHQUAKE FOR THIS REASON IT IS CRITICAL THAT HOUSE CERVI SIZED EVENTS AND ALSO TO BE PAY. THAT SO PRESENT AT FIRST FOR CARE. EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES PLANNING FOR DISASTER CENTERS ON TRANSPORTING PATIENTS IN THE AFFECTED AREA TO HOSPITALS OUTSIDE OF THE AFFECTED AREA USING BOTH GROUND AND AIR AMBULANCE RESEARCH IS. DREADED HELPS TO REDUCE THE ACUTE IMPACT HOSPITAL FACILITIES ALLOWS THE HOSPITALS TO FOCUS ON THEIR EXISTING PATIENT AND THE PATIENT'S ITSELF PRESENT FOLLOWING THE EVENT. A KEY ASSUMPTION AND MEDICAL AND HEALTH AFTER PLANNING ALSO RELIES ON HOSPITALS WORKING WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES KEEP THEM ON THE JOB UNTIL THEY ARE RELIEVED BY OTHER PERSONNEL. STAFF AVAILABILITY AND IT'S CRITICAL TO MAINTAINING THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE THE RIVER THROUGHOUT THE ACUTE IMPACTS OF A SEISMIC EVENT OR OTHER DISASTER. HOSPITALS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS TO HELP AUGMENT STAFFING SHORTAGES RELATED DISASTER EVENTS AND THIS MAY INCLUDE USING THEIR NORMAL STAFFING PROCESS BRINGING IN STAFF FROM- WITHIN IN HOSPITAL SYSTEMS OF THE APPLY TO DIGNITY KAISER TENANT AT CETERA- FROM AFFILIATED HOSPITALS OUTSIDE OF THE AFFECTED AREA THROUGH THE USE OF THE CALIFORNIA OR FEDERAL MEDICAL. ASSISTANCE TEAMS. HI THE MESSAGE THESE ANOTHER PART TYPICAL PLAN FOR THE STAFFING CONTINGENCIES THROUGH THEIR LOCAL HEALTH CARE COALITIONS. IN THE PLANNING FOR DISASTER WE MUST ALSO CONSIDER DAMAGE TO OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MADE LIMIT ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY RESOURCES THAT WOULD TRANSPORT PATIENTS OUTSIDE OF OUR COMMUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE IN A COMMUNITY LIKE NAPA WE MAY QUICKLY BECOME ISOLATED IF THERE IS DAMAGE TO OUR ROADS OR BRIDGES IF THE DISASTER EARTHQUAKE IMPACTS A LARGER REGIONAL AREA LIKE THE GREATER BAY AREA EMERGENCY TRANSPORTATION AND THE DESTINATION WHERE PATIENTS ARE TRANSPORTED TO WILL BE EVEN FURTHER AWAY FROM PAPPA FOR THESE REASONS. THE RAPID ARRIVAL OF ADDITIONAL MEDICAL TRANSPORT RESOURCES IS NOT AN OPTION THAT WE CAN RELY ON IN THESE EVENTS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PROVIDE TESTING CAN BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS HAVE. THANK YOU OF COURSE. FIRST IT IT SURE WOULD pIN NAPA- THE EARTHQUAKE AND FOURTEEN IS IT WHAT'S THE CONSTRUCTION WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE HOW TALL IS IT. YEAH SO- AT DIFFERENT BUILDINGS THERE ARE DIFFERENT SIZES I THINK WE TALK ABOUT IT FIVE STORIES RIGHT SO SMALL COMMUNITY- AND- THE DIFFERENT BUILDINGS IN DIFFERENT PHASES THAT MEET DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE- AS WE HEARD THERE'S MULTIPLE BUILDINGS THAT EACH ONE OF THESE SITES AND THEY- THEY WERE ALL IN VARYING STAGES. OF COMPLIANCE WITH- THE VERY REQUIREMENTS AT THE TIME OF THE TWENTY FOURTEEN EARTHQUAKE AND TODAY. IN THE MAGNET TO THE QUICK QUICK WAS WHAT OF THE- HEY WE WITH SIX I CAN'T REMEMBER. WHAT IT WAS- AFTER THE DECIMAL OKAY OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. IN THE QUESTIONS OKAY AT THAT A COUPLE QUESTIONS SO. AS YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL- THAT WOULD CHANGE TWENTY THIRTY STANDARDS- ONLY REQUIRE HOSPITAL'S EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SURGICAL SUITE AND POST SURGICAL SERVICES TO BE CONTINUOUSLY OPERATE. AND FOR ONLY SEVENTY TWO HOURS. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT. THAT WOULD MEAN FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES EVENT OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE SO IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHAT. WHAT KIND OF SERVICES NEED TO DEVELOP A DOCTOR PEOPLE SELF TRANSPORTING- ALSO I THINK THE OTHER THING I MIGHT WANT TO JUST TOUCH ON TO IS THAT. I DON'T BELIEVE CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG WITH- OTHERS BUILDING- HAVE THE SAME REQUIREMENTS AS WE'RE PUTTING OUT HOSPITALS SO IT COULD BE THAT. OF ALL THE PUBLIC FACILITIES ARE AVAILABLE IN THE- IN THE HOSPITAL MAY BE THE ONLY ONE THAT IS STANDING STABLE OPERATIONAL LIKE CITY HALL MIGHT BE COMING DOWN THE FIRE TO. THE OFFICE OR THE POLICE STATION MIGHT BE COMING DOWN SO- AND I DON'T KNOW IN YOUR EXPERIENCE NAPA SO WHAT THAT MEANS FOR A HOSPITAL. OPERATOR THIS BOOK BUT ALL THOSE WERE THE FEW MAJOR POP. THESE THAT NAY. HOPEFUL UNDER THE STANDARDS WITH BE OP. IN EMERGENCY. SO I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S A GREAT QUESTION HOSPITAL'S END UP BEING THESE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE COLLECT AFTER DISASTERS ACTUALLY AND SO THE FACT THAT THAT DID THE HOSPITALS HAVE DONE SO MUCH TO- MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SAFE FOR THE SEISMIC EVENTS AS- IS REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST CITY HALL OF THE FIVE. NATIONS WHERE PEOPLE COLLECT HOSPITALS AND UPPING THE CATION I- I WOULD I WOULD OFFER THE TWENTY THIRTY REQUIREMENTS THAT REQUIRE EMERGENCY SERVICES- TO CONTINUE CONTINUE TO BE PROVIDED- IS HELP AT IT'S A SEVENTY TWO HOUR WINDOW WRAPPED IN IT AND THAT THAT. UP WHICH IS. US TO RESOURCES TO COME FROM FURTHER AWAY TO HELP- THEN MEET THAT AND GAP- IF A HOSPITAL DOES HAVE TO FULLY BACKED UP BEING ABLE TO CARE FOR. IT IS THE MOST EMERGENT IT IS UP SELF BORDER AREA I THINK. THAT'S OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY WE- WE TRY TO WORK WITH THE FACILITIES TO AT LEAST REMAIN PARTIALLY OPEN OR HAVE CERTAIN SERVICE LINES OPEN. IN TO REMOVE DIVERSION AS AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE I BELIEVE IN THE RIDGE CREST EARTHQUAKE LAST SUMMER- THE EARTHQUAKE HIT ON FOR THE JULY. WITH THIS THURSDAY FROM SERVING RIGHT. AND WE WERE ALREADY TRYING TO COME UP TO SPEED TO BE POPPED BY SATURDAY SUNDAY- THE TIME FRAME IT REALLY. HE STOPPED AND EVACUATION FOR. THE CEO THEMSELVES SELF BACKING THEY CHOSE TO AND AGAIN IT WENT BACK TO DO THAT FEAR OR THE- STAFF COMING BACK. AND WASHED WAS THAT SIDE TEAM IS THERE SIGHTS ON WORKING THEM. TO MAKE THAT THEY HAD THEY TO AT LEAST RE OPEN. OKAY AND JUST TO CLARIFY. IN REGARDS TO USE YOU MENTIONED DEAL THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS CHILDREN PLACE PARTIAL FULL EVACUATION- AT AND UPS ECT AGES INVOLVED BUT WHO ACTUALLY MAKES THAT DECISION FOR THE HOSPITAL IS THAT THE HOSPITAL. SHIP IT'S- COURTESY IT SHOULD. COME IN WHO MAKES THE DECISION TO SAY WELL YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO DO A PARTIAL EVACUATION WE EVACUATE THE WHOLE. IT'S OUR STATE BUT IT HAS TO ANY THE HOSPITAL LEADER CAN STATE NO WE'RE GOING TO- WE'RE GOING TO EVACUATE WE CAN SAY- YOUR GREEN TAX BY ARCH POD. YOUR PERFECTLY FINE AT LEAST FROM OUR STANDPOINT FOR OPERATIONS BUT IF THEY FEEL LIKE THEY STILL WANT A TO A TO WAIT. FOR OTHER REASONS THEN THEY MAY CHOOSE THAT OPTION AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT CASE- THERE'S OTHER CONVERSATIONS THAT HAPPENED ALONG THE WAY WHERE IT'S A JOINT. DECISION LAST WEDNESDAY. THANK YOU WE HI AND WHAT. THEY HAD A UP WHY MAIN FOR OVER SEVENTY TWO HOURS AND THEY WERE WORKING ON CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO BE ABLE TO STILL KEEP OPERATIONS OPEN BUT AFTER HAVING A PHONE CALL WITH THEM SAYING HEY LOOK THIS IS NO LONGER SAFE THEY AGREED AND BECAUSE OF SEVENTY TWO HOURS THE CAT THEY HAD ALL THE TRANSFERRED MOST OF THEIR AND SAFELY OTHER STERN. SO WITHOUT. JUST REMAINING ENTRANCE FOR SIX. MOST THE TIME CONVERSATION THAT WERE IN AGREEMENT ITS RARE EARTH IT WOULD HAVE TO COME DOWN TO THE STATE SAYING NO THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NOT SAFE BUT THERE ARE CASES IN HISTORY WHERE THAT HAS HAPPENED. SO I MEAN I GUESS IT BE HELPFUL TO THINK ABOUT- CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT IT'S A CONVERSATION SOMEONE HAS TO MAKE A DECISION AND WHAT KIND OF FACTORSGO IN THAT DECISION I CERTAINLY. UNDERSTAND THAT- EVERYONE'S TRY TO DO THE RIGHT THING BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE MAY. BE NERVOUS LIKE WELL I'M CONCERNED ABOUT LIABILITY YEAH SO EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY SAY YOU KNOW WHAT AND THAT'S THE THINGS THAT DON'T SEEM TO. VERSUS THE VISUAL SPOTS IN THE INSTITUTION OF. THE COMMUNITIES THEY WILL WE NEED THIS IS TO OPERATE YOU KNOW THINGS ARE NOW SOME PEOPLE ARE STILL COMING ETCETERA AND THEY'RE LIKE WELL I'M WORRIED THAT I'M GOING TO GET. DEL SOMETHING ELSE IS HAPPEN AND HOW WE- ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS. DOES TO BE SURE AT THE HEART. CAN PLAY. ROLE IN NEEDS AS A SITE FOR- FOR RECOVERY AND CARE FOR PEOPLE DURING DURING A DISASTER. OKAY OCEANS HI. NINETY THREE WEEKS PANEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. A MUCH WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL WHICH IS- ON THE HOSPITAL PERSPECTIVE SO- TOM- BUT TO RAT CATHERINE AUSTIN SCOTT. KELLY MAY THIRD JED RIDING CRAIG WAGONER PLEASE COME ON UP. IT WILL HAVE YOU GUYS SELF INTRODUCES YOU- AS YOU SPEAK IF YOU DON'T MIND. THREE AS WITH THE PREVIOUS PANEL- WILL ASK IF YOU CAN KEEP YOUR COMMENT OR YOUR- PRESENTATION TO ROUGHLY THREE MINUTES AND THEN WE'LL WE'LL HAVE QUESTIONS FOR YOU TO. OKAY MR WATER AT I HOPE I SAID THAT RIGHT I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE IF I DO YOU NO PROBLEM THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME'S TOM MUCH READ. I'M A SENIOR PHYSICAL SCIENTIST WITH THE RAND CORPORATION. AND OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS I'VE BEEN RESEARCHING DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE- RAN THE NONPROFIT NONPARTISAN RESEARCH ORGANIZATION HEADQUARTERED IN SANTA MONICA. CALIFORNIA IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO EMPHASIZE NOT A WE'RE AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH ORGANIZATION WE'RE NOT HERE REPRESENTING ANY HOSPITAL OR- ASSOCIATION I'M GONNA BE RISING RESULTS OF A STUDY I COULD LEAD RAND WAS SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE TO RANT PREVIOUS. HI OF COMPLYING. THIRTY THAT. SB NINETY FIFTY TWO. OUR STUDY ALSO EXAMINE THE AFFORDABILITY THE HOSPITALS OF THIS ANTICIPATED SPENDING AS WELL AS OPPORTUNITY FOR AN CHALLENGES TO COMPLIANCE. I'M AS WE'VE SEEN OF NINETEEN FIFTY THREE REQUIRES A BY TWENTY THIRTY. HOSPITAL BUILDINGS THE PROVIDED TO CARE SERVICES MUST BE ABLE TO REMAIN OPERATIONAL AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE. I CAN SKIP A LOT OF THIS ABOUT WHAT THEY ASSUME THAT ALL SPC ONE BUILDINGS WOULD BE REMOVED FROM ACUTE CARE SERVICES AND DO NOT INCLUDE THEM IN OUR PROCESS. SO WE PRODUCE TO COST ESTIMATES THAT WERE DESIGNED TO REPRESENT THE UPPER AND LOWER BOUND TO FUTURE COSTS THE LOW END ESTIMATE IS FOR UPGRADING ENTIRELY THROUGH RETROFITTING OF EXISTING. BUILDINGS INVESTMENT FOR STRUCTURAL UPGRADING IS ENTIRELY THROUGH NEW CONSTRUCTION OF REPLACEMENT REPLACEMENT BUILDINGS ALONG WITH NONSTRUCTURAL UPGRADING THROUGH RETROFITTING OF ALL BUILDINGS THAT REQUIRE ONLY NONSTRUCTURAL SO IN OTHER WORDS BE FACING STRUCTURAL AND UPGRADING WAS IT ONLY NEED NONSTRUCTURAL WE USE THIS BRACKETING APPROACH BECAUSE MOST. AS WE WITH IN THAT THEY DID NOT YET KNOW WHETHER THEY WOULD PURSUE RETROFITTING REPLACEMENT OR SOME COMBINATION AS OF SEPTEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN BUILDINGS AND THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE HOSPITALS. STATEWIDE REQUIRED- SEISMIC UPGRADING. WE ESTIMATED THAT THE STATE WIDE COST FOR COMPLYING WITH SB NINETEEN FIFTY THREE RANGES FROM THIRTY TWO BILLION FOR THE RETROFITTING OF APPROACH AND A HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE BILLION FOR REPLACEMENT. WE INDEPENDENT VALIDATED A REPLACEMENT COST ESTIMATE USING DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES IN JANUARY RESULTS THAT WERE CONSISTENT WITH OUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATE. REINFORCING OUR CONFIDENCE IN OUR COST ESTIMATES. OUR IN OUR ANALYSIS ALSO ESTIMATE EXAMINE HOW WELL HOSPITALS COULD AFFORD THIS ESTIMATED SPENDING WE RATED EACH HOSPITAL ACCORDING TO FINANCIAL HEALTH INDEX THE CONSIDER SEVERAL FINANCIAL INDICATORS THEN THRESHOLD VALUES ARE DEFINED TO SIGN INDEX SCORES TO ONE OF THREE CATEGORIES- NO INDICATION OF FINANCIAL DISTRESS POTENTIAL FOR FINANCIAL DISTRESS AND SEVERE- FINANCIAL DISTRESS. AND APPLYING THE SCORING SYSTEM WE FOUND THAT 22% OF CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS ARE CURRENTLY IN SEVERE FINANCIAL DISTRESS AND FINANCIAL DISTRESS. GREATER FINANCIAL DISTRESS OCCURS DISPROPORTIONATELY AMONG PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC HOSPITALS AND AMONG HOSPITALS THAT SERVE HIGHER PROPORTIONS OF MEDI CAL PATIENTS. TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF SEISMIC UPGRADING COSTS ON THE HOSPITAL FINANCIAL HEALTH WE COMPUTER HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL HEALTH INDEX SCORES TO INCLUDE RETROFITTING COSTS AS A LIABILITY. AFTER RE COMPUTING THE PERCENT OF HOSPITALS IN SEVERE FINANCIAL DISTRESS INCREASE FROM 22% 240% AND THIS INCREASE IS DISPROPORTIONATELY BORNE BY INDEPENDENT PRIVATE HOSPITALS. COMMUNITY ACCESS BILLS AND PUBLIC HEALTH CARE DISTRICT HOSPITALS. IN ADDITION TO BEING PUT INTO FINANCIAL DISTRESS THESE HOSPITAL OWNERSHIP TYPES ARE COMPARATIVELY LESS COMPARATIVELY LESS CAPABLE. OF ABSORBING FINANCIAL DISTRESS WHICH MAGNIFIES THE IMPACT OF THE INCREASE IN DISTRESS ON OVERALL AFFORDABILITY. AND THIS REPRESENTS AND ANY INEQUITABLE IMPACTS OF DEFECTIVE SB NINETEEN FIFTY THREE COMPLIANCE ON CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND I'M LOWER SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUS POPULATIONS SERVED BY THESE KINDS HOSPITALS. OUR ANALYSIS ALSO EXAMS AND EXAMINE SOME ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO MEETING THE GOALS OF SB NINETEEN FIFTY THREE. SUCH AS ALTERNATIVE FINANCING MODELS REGIONALIZATION AND REVISED SCHEDULING AND I'D BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER THERE'S INTERESTS. ARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE SCOTT. AFTERNOON CAPTAIN SCOTT I KNOW HOW TO PUSH A BUTTON GOOD AFTERNOON CAPTAIN SCOTT WITH CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION I JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS BEFORE- OUR HOSPITALS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH THE SEISMIC MAN I'M FOR AS YOU FROM OFF WE'VE GOT NINETY. HOSPITALS THAT MEET IN STANDING REQUIREMENTS SUCH ISSUE THAT WHILE IT'S TAKEN A LONG TIME TO GET THERE- AS YOU HEARD FROM OFF FOR THEIR VARIOUS ROADS WE HAD TO TAKE IN AND WE ARE FINALLY THERE- INCOME XIN COUPLE YEAR. NOT BE A TO AND EMPLOYEES INCIDENT MANDATE SECONDLY- WE'VE BEEN ASKED THE QUESTION WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THIS TEN YEARS AWAY- IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR NOW BECAUSE IT TAKES AT LEAST TEN YEARS TO DO THE KIND FOR FITTING AND MORE IMPORTANTLY REPLACING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR TWENTY THIRTY THE MAJORITY OF OUR HOSPITALS WILL LIKELY BE A REPLACEMENT- IT TAKES A COUPLE YEARS TO WORK THROUGH THE PLAN A COUPLE YEARS TO WORK THROUGH THE LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS. PLAYERS TO WORK THROUGH THE OFF PROCESS ON A COMPLEX PROJECT LIKE THIS AND THEN AT LEAST FOUR YEARS TO BUILD SO FOR US TO CUT TWENTY THIRTY MANDATE OUR HOSPITALS ARE CONTEMPLATING THIS NOW WHICH IS WHY THE HOSPITALS ARE- AND WILLING TO TALK ABOUT IT I'M AND LASTLY I. WE WILL TO TALK ABOUT. I'M THANKS FOR A HOUSE THERE AND IS WITH US ON THEIR VARIOUS WAYS WHICH WE MAY OUR DOES PLAN BUT WE ARE PLANNING SEISMIC TODAY OUR HOSPITALS PLAN- AND TO OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES RELATED TO A BIG EARTHQUAKE TODAY THEY'RE NOT WAITING FOR TWENTY THIRD PLANNING AN EXERCISE IN THESE TODAY AS WAS POINTED OUT BY THE SECOND PANEL SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT I'M MORE HOT. ARE WORKING YOU READY. FOR THE BIG EARTHQUAKE AT ANY GIVEN TIME SO I'D LIKE TO- IF I COULD DO A QUICK INTRODUCTION I'M TODAY YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE THREE HOSPITALS WE HAVE CRAIG WAGONER FROM. COMMUNITY COMMUNITY REGIONAL IN CLOVIS REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER WILL TALK ABOUT THE MULTIPLE BILLIONS OF THEY WILL FACE- FROM CINEMA VALLEY- MULTIPLE BILLIONS I APOLOGIZE FOR THE BE. HI KELLY MY OTHER- CO CINEMA VALLEY- WHO ALSO TALK ABOUT- FUNDING ISSUES AND THEN THE EFFORTS THEY HAD TO REBUILD THEIR KEY DE. AND THEN FROM MAD RIVER CHAD BREAD BECAUSE A RULE HOSPITAL AS YOU DISCUSSED UP NORTH WHO HAS UNIQUE ISSUES RELATED TO THE RETROFIT OF A SINGLE STORY BUILDING. SO WHY DON'T WE START WITH KELLY. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M KELLY MOTHER CEO AT CINEMA VALLEY HOSPITAL- SNOWMOBILE HOSPITAL IS A DISTRICT HOSPITAL TO SMALL ACUTE CARE FACILITY GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED. THIRTY MINUTES FROM THE LOCAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND WE HAVE DOUBLE THE SENIOR POPULATION THAT MOST HAVE. WERE THE LARGEST EMPLOYER WE HAVE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ECONOMIC IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITY. WE HAVE A SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE AND MOST OF THE PHYSICIANS RELY ON US FOR SUPPORT AT THE HOSPITAL WAS NOT THERE. WE DON'T THINK MANY PHYSICIANS WOULD BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO STAY IN THE COMMUNITY. RESOURCES HAVE ALREADY ALWAYS BEEN LIMITED WE ARE ONE OF THOSE HOSPITALS THAT IS IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS AT TIMES BUT ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO THE COMMUNITY DECIDED TO INVEST IN THE HOSPITAL. THEY PASSED A PARCEL TAX WE WERE THEN EIGHT TO FOUR THE OPERATE. IT CAN YOU TO. IT'S FROM MEDICAID. AND MEDICARE. ABOUT THAT SAME TIME WE HAD TO WIN NOW KNEW WE WERE GOING TO BE ALIVE NOW WE HAD TO FACE THE SEISMIC. ISSUE WE TRIED SEVERAL TIMES A BY THE THIRD TIME WE PASSED AT THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR. GEO BOND. THAT WASN'T ENOUGH TO REPLACE THE HOSPITAL BUT IT WAS CERTAINLY ENOUGH TO GET US TO AT LEAST BE SAFE FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE. OUR FIRST PRIORITY AND THEN WE CHOSE THE EMERGENCY IN SURGERY DEPARTMENT TO REPLACE INPUT AND IT TO A TWENTY THIRTY BUILDING. SO WE BOTH MET THE INTENT OF THE CODE TAKING THOSE ESSENTIAL SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED BY THE COMMUNITY. AND IN THE TWENTY THIRTY BILL. LOOK AT A FOR TWENTY. WE HAVE IN TOWER THAT HAS A NOW CENSUS TEN. WE KNOW THAT IN EMERGENCIES WE'VE SUFFERED THEM THROUGH THE FIRES BEFORE THAT WE CAN EASILY TRANSFER PATIENTS OUT THERE ARE SURROUNDING HOSPITALS AND WE'VE ESTIMATED THAT THE COST OF REPLACING ARE IMPATIENT TOWER IS OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT OUR UNITY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT ANOTHER BOND IN ADDITION TO THE TAXES AND WE WOULD HAVE TO CLOSE IF WE HAD TO MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY EXPECT. WE'RE A THING WHICH I THINK AND IT ALL AS AN ALTERNATIVE. IS EMERGENCY IN SURGERY COMPLY WITH THE TWENTY THIRTY GUIDELINES AND THEN WE ARE ABLE TO OFFER THE ESSENTIAL SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE WHICH IS MOSTLY OUTPATIENT. THANK YOU. HI THERE I'M CHEN READ DIRECTOR OF ANCILLARY SERVICES AND SAFETY AT MAD RIVER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL AND- I'M HERE REPRESENTING MAD RIVER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL I BROUGHT A COUPLE OF PICTURES- I BELIEVE SENATOR PAN HAD HAD ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT- ONES THAT LOOK LIKE IN SOME HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WHAT IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE AND FEEL LIKE FOR OUR SINGLE STORY WOOD FRAME HOSPITAL. WHICH IS IT A SEE TO IT IF IT WERE ACTED SO WE'VE ACTUALLY AS A ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD POINT IT OUT FOR US WE'VE ALREADY HAD THREE EARTHQUAKES I THREE LARGE INTO HOSTILE NINETY SEP TO THE FIRST NINETY EIGHTY I WAS SEVEN POINT FOUR MEG AND IN THE NIGHT SIXTY TWO WE HAD A SEVEN WE WANT A MORE. WE HAD A SIX EARTHQUAKE AND DOT BACK TO THOSE. ALL HEADS BOB INSTRUCTION NOT A BROKEN NINETY A CRACK PIPE. SO AS A SINGLE STORE RURAL WE SHOULDER A BIG COST IF WE'RE TO PURSUE TWENTY THIRTY COMPLIANCE AND ONE OF THE ELEMENTS MANY ELEMENTS FOR SEISMIC COMPLIANCE IS THE THING CALLED MICRO PILES AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IMAGES WHEN MICHAEL PYLE LOOKS LIKE IN A HOSPITAL. THE NEXT IMAGE. RIGHT COULD BE THAT. ALL RIGHT I GOT MULTIPLE SKILLS ALL THE BAD EXES HERE THOSE ARE THE AREAS WITHIN OUR HOSPITAL THAT REQUIRE A MICRO PILE. IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE BEAUTIFUL BUT YOU SEE THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT THOSE KIND OF TWO THINGS IMPACTING PATIENT CARE AND SO WE'VE GOT HUGE DISTRACTIONS GOING ON WHILE WE'RE TRYING TO SHUFFLE PATIENTS AROUND WE HAVE TO CLOSE CERTAIN SECTION OF THE BUILDING. AND THEN. BILL MIKE PYLE SO THIS IS JUST ONE SMALL ELEMENT AND MEANWHILE AS WERE CLOSING ON THIS PATIENT CARE AREAS WERE ALSO LOSING REVENUE FOR OUR- LITTLE. AS THE RURAL HA. WE THIS YOU KNOW WHAT MATTERS MOST WITH WHERE WE PUT OUR MONEY AND WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY DAY PATIENTS THERE WHAT WE ACTUALLY IT IS NEW RADIOLOGY EQUIPMENT WE NEED NEW ERROR HANDLERS. WE NEED A VERY SIMPLE THINGS LIKE RESTROOM UPGRADES NEW FLOORING- GOING AFTER THIS- THIS REGULATION AND TRYING TO ACHIEVE IT- WE HAVE TO SHOW UP BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. F. REST TO REALISTICALLY VETERAN MAKE IT AHA. I'M THAT'S NOT SU. PLASTIC FOR A HALF ARE SO NINE THE CLOSE. AND THIS IS FOR A YOU KNOW FOR A SINGLE STORY WOOD FRAMED- A BUILDING THAT HAS SUCCESSFULLY SURVIVED THREE OF QUAKES MAJOR EARTHQUAKES UP TO THIS POINT. WE'RE URGING YOU ARE REQUESTING THAT YOU GIVE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION FOR- HOSPITALS LIKE OURS THAT- TO NOT HOLD TO THAT TWENTY THIRTY REQUIREMENT- ESPECIALLY FOR SINGLE STORY WOOD FRAME HOSPITAL LIKE OURS WITHOUT YOUR HELP- WE'RE NOT SURE THAT WE COULD STAY OPEN- WE WOULD HAVE TO CLOSE THE HOSPITAL WE WORRY THAT OTHER FOLKS OBVIOUSLY HERE AT. WITH THIS NAPA CLOSER HOSPITAL AS WELL. IT DOESN'T SERVE OUR COMMUNITY IT DOESN'T SERVE PATIENTS. WE NEED TO INVEST MONEY IN PATIENT CARE NOT NECESSARILY ELIMINATED IN THIS CASE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S CRAIG WAGONER ON THE CEO OF COMMUNITY REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER LOCATED IN- DOWNTOWN FRESNO AND JUST- THREE THINGS I'D LIKE TO COVER THIS AFTERNOON- ONE IS OUR- UNIQUE REGION IN THE PATIENTS WE SERVE OUR COMMITMENT TO SAFETY IN RED READY MISS AND ALSO OUR SEISMIC RISK IN FRESNO- ARE FOR COUNTY REGION WHICH INCLUDES- FRESNO KING MADERA. TULARE COUNTIES- SUFFERS OF COURSE AND DISPROPORTIONATE HEALTH BURDENS INCLUDING SOME OF THE HIGHEST PART OF THE- IN THE STATE TO AT TWENTY FIVE PER PAN AND EMPLOYMENT AT EIGHT PERCENT. AND HEALTH THIRTY SUCH AS OBESITY DIABETES AND WE SERVICE VERY DIVERSE- POPULATION- THIS SPEAKS MORE THAN A HUNDRED DIFFERENT LANGUAGES INCOMES FOR FROM A VARIETY OF CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS. AT SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE ED. UP GRAPH FOR THE. ALL UP IN FRONT OF YOU COMMUNITY RIDGE MEDICAL. IS A LOT SAFETY NET HAAS IN THE STATE ONLY SO. TO LA COUNTY USC- FOR MEDI CAL DISCHARGE- WE RUN A COMPREHENSIVE LEVEL ONE TRAUMA CENTER BURN CENTER PEDIATRIC TRAUMA NEONATAL ICU. WHICH SERVES THE REGION BETWEEN LOS ANGELES AND- SACRAMENTO. BY GOVERNMENT INSURANCE 53% OF THOSE PATIENTS- HAVE MEDI CAL AND WE PROVIDE ACTUALLY A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE- THAN MOST HOSPITAL REGION TAKEN REFERRALS FOR CLINICS. OTHER OUTLETS IN HOT WHEELS RECEIVING ABOUT SIX HUNDRED PATIENTS MONTH- IT. IS A HIGH LEVEL CARE TRANSFERS. CAN YOU YOU REGIONAL IS ALL SO HOME. TO UCS FOR AS GRAD MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM WHICH WE TRAIN ABOUT THREE HUNDRED- AND MEDICAL AND GRADUATE MEDICAL STUDENTS A YEAR AND WE GRADUATE ABOUT A HUNDRED PHYSICIANS ANNUALLY FOR. A PATIENT ANDEMPLOYEE SAFETY OF COURSE IS EXTREMELY- IMPORTANT TO US AND WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TWO HUNDRED AND WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY STANDARDS IN COMPLETED CONSTRUCTION OF A FIVE STOREY TRAUMA IN CRITICAL CARE BUILDING IN TWO THOUSAND OR- IS COMPLY. TWENTY STANDARDS HOWEVER. A TWO OF OUR PATIENT CARE BUILDINGS NOT MEET THE TWENTY THIRD STANDARDS AND IS PROJECTED ON THE SCREEN AND YOU'LL SEE THE HASHED OUT- AREAS THAT'S A SIX. SEVENTEEN OUT OF OUR SIX EIGHT FIVE BEDS OR 90% OF. WILL TO BE REPLACED AT BECAUSE OF OVER TO BE. DOLLAR AS ONE OF THE NINE LICENSE COMPREHENSIVE HOSPITALS IN OUR STATE OUR TRAUMA% CRITICAL CARE BUILDING HOUSES EMERGENCY SERVICES- WITH SURGICAL SUITES POST SURGICAL SERVICES AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE NINETY SIX HOURS OF UTILITIES AND SUPPLIES EXCEEDING THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR- REQUIREMENT IN BECAUSE OF OUR CRITICAL CARE BUILDING IF A SEISMIC ACTUATION OUR BASES. WE'RE DECISION TO DESTINATION LOCATION FOR EMERGENCIES AT TIMES OF DISASTERS WE ARE REGULARLY PLACED ON CALL TO RECEIVE PATIENTS IF HOSPITAL EVACUATIONS ARE NECESSARY AS WITH THE SITUATION. FOR THE RETURN RIDGECREST EARTHQUAKE IN KINCAID FOR A FIRE AND CALIFORNIA. OUR HOSPITAL IS LOCATED IN THE VICINITY TRADITIONALLY CHARACTERIZED BY LOW TO MODERATE SEISMIC ACTIVITY BUT WE HAVE BEEN CORRELATED WITH HIGH SEISMIC RISK IS WE ARE SITUATED BETWEEN THE EASTERN SIERRA NEVADA FAULT IN THE DISTANT. SAN ANDREAS FAULT WHICH INCLUDES THE WESTERN PORTION OF FRESNO COUNTY SO UNFORTUNATELY WE REPEAT THE SAME BROAD BRUSH- AS OTHERS THAT MAY BE DIRECTLY LOCATED NEXT TO A FAULT LINE SO OUR REGION DEPENDS ON THIS HOSPITAL THE SAFETY NET HOSPITAL TO BE READY AT ALL TIMES. BUT OUR SAFETY NET STATUS MAKES IT CHALLENGING. FUND TO BE IN DOLLARS OF COSTS TO MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY SEISMIC STANDARDS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS SENATOR MONNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN JOINT CHAIRS AND STAFF FOR ORGANIZING THIS- QUESTION FOR THE LAST WITNESS- FROM COMMUNITY REGIONAL YOU HAVE THE REPLACEMENT COST IT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IS THERE AN OPTION FOR RETROFITTING REINFORCEMENT SOMETHING SHORTER FOR PLACE YES- THE RETROFIT THAT YOU JUST A LITTLE OVER ONE BILL. ABOUT HALF THE PROJECT ADDRESS MUCH AND VERY INVASIVE AS WELL MMHM. AND I KNOW WE HEARD FROM THE PRIOR PANEL. EACH HOSPITAL SITE IS DIFFERENT EACH CAMPUS IS DIFFERENT THERE'S NOT. A UNIFORM FIX I'M WONDERING IF- ALLOWING ANY GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN THE EVALUATION OR RANKING- COULD. COULD ADAPT BETTER TO THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THE DIFFERENT HOSPITALS- MAYBE FOR THE CJ REPRESENTED SURE- I THINK I'D ACTUAL PROBABLY DEFERRED OFF PUT MORE IS I'M NOT A STRUCTURAL ENGINEER BUT I THINK- AS WE HAVE- MATURE TO SEISMIC MANDATE- PARTICULARLY THE US STAY STANDING MANDATE- SO HAVE THE REQUIREMENTS I THINK WE ARE NOW DOWN TO A PLACE WHERE. WE WHEN YOU TALK FULLY OPERATIONAL- AND WHAT IS OPERATIONAL EXCUSE ME REASON WHAT FOR CATIA OPERATIONAL IT NOW GETS DOWN TO- WHETHER THE BUILDING WILL BE ABLE TO OPERATE AFTER A DISASTER AND I AND I ALWAYS STRUGGLE WITH. FOLKS AT THE STATE AND I HOUSE HOW OPERATED WITH THE BUILDINGS WE HAVE TODAY AFTER DISASTERS. SO I THINK THAT OUR SQUAD STRUGGLING OR OUGHT NOT SHOWING OFF BODS WORKING FOR STANDARD THAT FROM AN ENGINEERING STANDPOINT. I'M CAN ASSURE THAT LEVEL OF SECURITY- AND I THINK WE APPRECIATE THAT BUT AT THE SAME TIME OUR HOSPITALS HAVE. SCHOOL EXPERIENCE OF HAVING SURVIVED VARIOUS DIFFERENT DISASTERS WITH THE STRUCTURES WE HAVE TODAY SO WE CAN PROBABLY TAKE A LOOK BASS- THE- MANDATE SHORED. I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIND IS THE BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT WE- WHAT WE KNOW WE DO IN DISASTERS ALREADY. WITH THE STRUCTURES AND WE HAVE TODAY- KNOWING THAT THEY'LL STAY STANDING- AND WHAT IS ENGINEERING WISE THE RIGHT. YOU KNOW OR THE- THE- REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO OPERATIONAL THANK YOU AND I THINK NOT SO MUCH FOR THIS PANEL BUT MAYBE MORE OF A COMMENT I KNOW A LOT OF THE- SAFETY PRECAUTIONS. FOLKS LINED XIN BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES EMPLOYEES AND STAFF- BUT WHETHER THERE'S CALCULUS IN THE TERMS. YOU FACILITY IS NOT OPERATIONAL OR REQUIRES PATIENT EVACUATION. IF THERE'S ANY CALCULATION IN THE RAND REPORT OR OTHERS. OF IMPACT YES LOST JOBS ECONOMIC. TO MAYBE THE REPRESENTATIVE IN THE RAND REPORT. GREAT QUESTIONS BUT NO WE DIDN'T LOOK AT THAT AT ALL SO ON FOR SO I CAN'T REALLY COMMENT. SO I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD ONE OF THE BOUNCING AXES. IN SAFETY WORKER SAFETY IMMEDIATE RISK BUT THEN ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF. THIS PLACE TO NOT ONLY PATIENTS BUT THIS PLACED. POLICE IN TIME OF CRISIS SO DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON IT WOULD ONLY ARGUE THAT THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE IS BEING HIT BY THIS EARTHQUAKE REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT AN EIGHT POINT NO SO TO THE EARLIER- POINT I THINK IT WAS OF DOCTOR PANS- THE HOSPITAL- MAY BE OPERATIONAL BUT THERE MAY BE NOTHING OR NOT MUCH AROUND IT THAT'S OPERATIONAL. THROUGH WHAT WHAT ARE WE RETURNING TO OR SING SOME OF THAT IN PARADISE UNFORTUNATELY AND THERE'S OF THAT IN OTHER COMMUNITIES IT TOOK NAPA DOWNTOWN WILD THREE YOU KNOW TO RE- GAIN THEIR STATURE I THINK THERE ARE STILL SOME BUILDINGS THAT MIGHT BE AT RISK SO I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO ALSO LEVELS AT OUR SCHOOLS IN THE- UNITIES FARM UNDER. MAKE ME IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE ALL. I'M NO WATER NO POWER NO SEWAGE. AND THERE CAN YOU. THERE ARE. LESSONS LEARNED MEAN FROM THE- WILD FIRE JUST ASK. I THINK DE PAN EARLIER QUESTION TO THREE AND FOR. IN REBOUND IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE FUEL TO KEEP GENERATORS GOING FOR SEVENTY TWO HOURS. BUT IT'S- IT'S IN ADDED CATASTROPHE OF THOSE POWER LINES AREN'T RESTORED IF. SEWERS OUT IF WATER SO TO THINK THAT HAS TO BE PART OF THE- CALCULUS OF. IN SPAIN DISASTERS AS WELL BUT- THANK YOU FOR CHAIRS WHO. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION ACTUALLY IS MISTER COLEMAN FOR MUCH BUT THE MIND COMING BACK UP TO THE PODIUM. THANK YOU. THE **** YEAH I WANNA THANK THE PRESENTERS FOR THEIR PRESENTATIONS. SO. YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE HOSPITAL'S TALKING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES BECAUSE OF CEDARS COMPETING DEMANDS FOR RESOURCES- AND- YOU KNOW ONE IS OF COURSE ASSURING WE HAVE A- BOTH A SAFE FACILITY FOR THE PATIENTS THAT ARE IN THE FACILITY AT THE TOP AND THE SIXERS STRIKES WELLS OF COURSE THE WORKERS WHO ARE WORKING IN THAT FACILITY AS WELL. JUST CLARIFY I UNDERSTAND THAT THE TWENTY THIRTY STANDARD IS FOCUSED ON THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT THE SURGICAL SUITES AND POST SURGICAL SERVICES BEING UP OPERATE FOR SEVENTY TWO HOURS SO THAT'S THAT. AND ACTUALLY FOR- MISTER- COLEMAN- THAT DAY GET THAT CORRECTLY THAT AND THAT IS THAT FOR THE NONSTRUCTURAL SIDE OF THINGS. CURRENTLY THE LAW REQUIRES ALL ACUTE CARE SERVICES TO BE- FUNCTIONAL INSOFAR AS PRACTICAL. OKAY THAT NOT JUST THOSE PARTICULAR SERVICES ALL ACUTE CARE SERVICES ALL RIGHT SO THAT MEANS THE ENTIRE- HOSPITAL YOU ANY BUILDING THAT IS PROVIDING A TWO CAR SERVICE FOR EXAMPLE. IF YOU HAVE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND SURGICAL- THEY NEED CLINICAL LABS THE PHARMACY IS THERE A LOT OF OTHER. COMPONENTS OF A HOSPITAL THAT STILL NEED TO FUNCTION AND FOR THOSE TO BE ABLE TO FUNCTION AS WELL SO FOR ALL THOSE ANCILLARY. SERVICES OKAY RIGHT NEXT. ONE FIVE SO IN TERMS OF. WE'RE LOOKING AHEAD THIRD NOW WE TALK ABOUT THE SPC TO TWENTY OF ALL THE BUILDINGS IS NOW WE HAVE TO WE HAVE STRUCTURAL OF THE NONSTRUCTURAL AND- SO IN TERMS OF. ISN'T WELL MAYBE IT'S MORE QUESTION FOR THE HOSPITALS AND HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION IS AND I REALIZE THAT IT'S A MUTUAL BURDEN BUT AS THE MAIN BURDEN R. COSTA MAYBE THE RIGHT PERSON TO TALK ABOUT THIS- THE DOCTOR FOR A TOUR AT IS THE MAIN BURDEN. TO GET STRUCTURAL POINT- SO BASICALLY BRING THE SPC TO IN COMPLIANCE OR IS THE STARS AT THE NONSTRUCTURAL THE NPC REQUIRE THAT'S THE MAIN CHALLENGE FOR A FINANCIALLY FOR HOSPITALS THAT SHE'S. AT YEAH. YEAH SO AS FAR AS- TOTAL CHALLENGE I ANSWER FINE ARE ESTIMATES WHAT OR IT WAS AROUND HALF OF IN THE FITTING. AND HALF THE STRUCTURAL AND HALF WAS NONSTRUCTURAL OKAY- AS FAR AS THE OTHER IMPACTS TO HAVE TO TALK TO THE HOSPITAL'S. YEAH I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT- I THINK THE STRUCTURAL- PIECE REPRESENTS- WHAT WE SEE IS THAT LARGER FINANCIAL SORT OF STEEL BEAMS AND CONSTRUCTION PIECE AND THE NONSTRUCTURAL- CREATE SOME CHALLENGES- OPERATIONALLY AS WELL WE SORT OF PUT IT IN A COUPLE OF BUCKETS SO WE HAVE HOSPITALS THAT EVEN IF THEY- ARE. BEING FOR THE INITIAL PIECE- THEY HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH THEIR OF BEING LANDLOCKED AND MOVING SERVICES AROUND SO IF HOSPITALS THAT MIGHT HAVE SIX BUILDINGS AND YOU CAME OUT AND IF YOU NEED TO RETROFIT FOR OF THE BUILDING. LOOK AT THIS PIC. NEED TO BE DIRECTOR OF. CURRENTLY HAS SERVICES AND ITS UNIT TO MOVE ONCOLOGY TO A BUILDING THAT WILL MEET THE REQUIREMENT- AND DOC OF WHAT. IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE DOWN IN OFFICE BUILDING TO PUT UP WITH IT TO MOVE DOC RETURN. THE CAT EIGHT A FACT CAN BE EQUALLY IS JUST TO SIR SO WE HOSPITAL THE FIT AND BUCKET. AND AS YOU HEARD TODAY WE HAVE HOUSE THAT FOR IN THE BOX OF JUST NOW BEING ABLE TO AFFORD IT SERVE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT BOX OF ISSUES FOR HOSPITALS- DEPENDING ON THE REGION IN THE TYPE OF HOSPITAL. THE NONSTRUCTURAL CREATES. RACIAL CHALLENGES IT AND POP WOULD KNOW THIS AS WELL BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE ARE YOU TO TEAR OPEN A WALL- AND IT'S THE PLUMBING PAGES AND NOT I'M STOCK IN TRADE OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES AS WELL. I SORRY I JUST WANNA CLEAR. THE NO FOR STATE. SURE AT A GIVEN HOSPITAL IT'S A MUCH MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE FOR AS PC THE REASON IT'S ABOUT HALF STATEWIDE AS FAR FAR MORE BUILDINGS NEED ONLY NONSTRUCTURAL- BRATCHER UPGRADING. SO FOR THE **** STATEWIDE IT'S ABOUT HALF AN HAPPEN FOR A BUILDING IT'S FAR MORE EXPENSIVE TO THE STRUCTURAL ON THE OTHER ONES ARE SPC TO THE NEED TO DO STRUCTURE UPGRADES RIGHT. OKAY AND THEN I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT- MISS COLEMAN I KNOW AND WHEN YOU PRESENTED. WE TALKED ABOUT INCORPORATING THE SEISMIC RISKIN TERMS OF WHAT. WE'RE HEARING STORIES VALLEY'S FROM AT LEAST OF THE PEOPLE PRESENTED HERE MY HOSPITAL STILL STANDING IN OPERATION WE'VE HAD THREE EARTHQUAKES ETCETERA- SO CAN YOU. CAN SIGN ALL THE STANDARD. THIS WILL PRESENT THE FACT THAT THERE. HOUSE ARE STILL STANDING. AFTER EARTHQUAKES IN YOU'RE SAYING WE STONE TO REST YOUR HOUSE. CAN YOU. PERHAPS ADDRESS HOW ASH IS A- THE ISSUE. THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL MOST OF THESE BUILDINGS HAVE NOT SEEN WHAT WE CALL THE DESIGN EARTHQUAKE OKAY SO THEY MAY HAVE SEEN SOME LARGE EARTHQUAKES SIX POINT ALL UP IN SOME IS SET UP TO SEVEN- BUT MANY OF THESE LOCATIONS ARE CAPABLE OR OUR FAULTS ARE CAPABLE OF AN EIGHT HOUR. OR LARGER EARTHQUAKE THAT THESE HAVE NOT BEEN SUBJECTED. AND OF COURSE THAT THE LIGHTER MEXICO. RECKONS A MATTER OF WIND THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NOT IF IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BASED ON. WHAT GEOLOGISTS TELL US. AND SO- THAT IS TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IN THE STRUCTURAL CAPACITY THE BILLING SECONDLY AS I MENTIONED- IN THESE BUILDINGS ARE BUILT FOR THE ACT. OF THOSE STRUCTURAL CODES. DID NOT HAVE A COVER OF LATERAL RESISTANCE OR SEISMIC SAFETY. AND SO MANY OF THESE BUILDINGS HAVE STRUCTURAL WEAKNESSES. THAT IF. THEY ARE. EXPOSED TO THESE DESIGNER QUAKES- COULD HAVE CATASTROPHIC EVENT OF RESULTS. OKAY AND PERHAPS MAYBE- THE HOSPITAL'S MIGHT. AND IF YOU WANT A RISK. TO THAT TERMS OF FEAR CONVERSATIONS DAS POTTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE CONSULTANTS REGARDING. I MEAN I KNOW YOUR HOSPITAL DID SURVIVE SEVERAL EARTHQUAKES I. SEE GOT- WHICH DOMINO'S TALKING THAT MS FROM THE MAD RIVER MAYBE CAN ADD AND I REALIZE YOU'RE COMPETING DEMANDS BUT NO WHAT WE HEARING IS THAT WEALTH FROM THE LARGER ONE I MEAN I REALIZE YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN THE LARGER ONES GOING TO HIT AND HOW MANY YEARS THAT WILL TAKE BUT TH SAME TIME. GOD FORBID. SOMETHING HAPPENS- WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE THAT RISK AGAINST. IMMEDIATE NEEDS CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT WHAT I CONVERSATIONS YOU'VE HAD WITH US FIVE OR OTHER CONSULTANTS ABOUT THE RISKS THAT. THE YOUR TOP STRUCTURE HAS TO A LARGE EARTHQUAKE EVENT THAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN YOUR COMMUNITY WHY NO THEY WEREN'T ACTIVE CON ALL CAN SPEAK TO IS THAT WE'RE NOT CONVERSATION WITHOUT HOT AND WE'VE BEEN COLLABORATING AND GAVE GIVEN MEDIA FEEDBACK ON THE RECENT CHANGES. HAS SOME OF THE EXAMPLES HE MENTIONED IN HIS IS TALK WE'RE WE'RE BECAUSE WE WERE SEEING SEEN CABINETS IN OUR BROOM CLOSETS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TEAR UP THE WALL IN THE BROOM CLOSET. AND THEN DO WHAT AND IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE SO WE'RE ACTED ABSOLUTELY NEXT CONVERSATION. SPEAKING ABOUT THE BIG. THE CALL ON THAT SPECIFICALLY BUT IT SEEMS. UNIQUE THAT THE HOT. BEING TO BE ON KIND AT THE SAID OF THE ENTIRE SO. RIGHT AS A VERY NEW REQUIRED FOR HAAS. AND WE ACTUALLY TO PLAY OUR- BUT PUT ALL RESPOND. IN HOSPITALS DOES HE LIKE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESPONSIBILITY PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE'S NO- SUPPORT. AT IN OUR CASE WE ARE A STANDALONE PRIVATE HOSPITAL. WE DON'T HAVE ANY DISTRICTS SUPPORT. SO THAT PRESENTS A UNIQUE CHALLENGE OKAY AND I THINK AND IF THEY HAVE MADE SOME REMARKS EARLIER OUT THE FACT THAT- THE HOSPITAL'S PAY THE ONLY BUILDINGS WERE PUTTING THIS KIND OF STANDARD SO- SEEMS BUT WE HAVEN'T. REALLY PUT IN A- THAT THE HOSPITAL THE- DRIVING STRUCTURE. AN EVENT A LARGE EARTHQUAKE. SIMILAR TO OF THE ACTUALLY OUT ALSO I THINK. IT'S MAYOR WAGNER I REMEMBER YOUR NAME CORRECTLY DO WANT TO SPEAK TO THESE YOU TALK ABOUT YOU WE HAVE THE PICTURE OF YOUR HOSPITAL HERE. IN TERMS OF- YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE IN OUR SPOT OR OTHER TYPES OF CONSOLES REGARDING. SURELY THE SAFETY OF YOUR PATIENTS AND STAFF- IN THE EVENT OF A YOU KNOW AT THAT THE- POSSIBLE EARTHQUAKE IN YOUR COMMUNITY THAT THE SIZE THAT. YES CERTAINLY YES WE COMMISSIONED A- INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY TO COME IN AND LOOK AT. THOSE BUILDINGS THAT YOU SEE HASH MARK OUT THERE NOW- TO COMPLETE A SEISMIC STUDIES STRUCTURAL STUDY FOR US. AND ACTUALLY THE- WILL AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH US BUT- ON THAT STUDY- IN AND- ARE AWAITING COMMENTS BACK SO. WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE THAT CONVERT THATCONVERSATION AS WELL- OUR- OUR BIG CONTENTION IS OF COURSE IN FRESNO. WE DON'T BELIEVE THERE WILL I KNOW I'M PREDICTING THE TRYING TO PREDICT THE FUTURE HERE BUT- WE SOMEBODY HAS TO YEAH. WE DON'T BELIEVE THERE WILL EVER BE AN EIGHT POINT OH. EARTHQUAKE IN FRESNO- WERE IT WE ARE AND WE ALSO COMMISSION SOMEBODY TO DO. A SEISMIC ZONE STUDY FOR IS- THAT TELLS US WE ARE IN A VERY LOW SEISMIC. AREA. WHICH MEANS THAT- THE ENTIRE COUNTY IS PAINTED AS THE YOU KNOW. HIGHER RISK- SEISMIC AREA. IN THE FRESNO IS KIND OF BALLING. OR KIND ROLLED INTO THAT SAME CATEGORY AS WELL WITH IT WHERE IT'S NOT SO AND- MISTER COLEMAN- DOES THE LAW GIVES YOU SOME FLEXIBILITY IN REGARDS. THE CANDY YOU KNOW THEY MAKE THE CASE THAT LAST EYES BECAUSE WE WERE A REAL RESPONSE MORE AND- YEAH I KNOW SEVEN POINT OVER SIX POINT OVERS AN EIGHT POINT- BECAUSE OF GIVEN OUR LOCATION DE THAT'S THAT. THE FACT THAT. YOUR VALUE WITH NEED TO THE YES SIR. OF WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL HIS PC FORTY WHICH IS A DAMAGE CONTROL RIGHT- CATEGORY THE LAWS HOSPITAL BUILDINGS TO GO BEYOND TWENTY THIRTY. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT EXISTING BUILDINGS THAT WERE BUILT FOR THE ACT. CANNOT BE MADE A COMPLAINT WITH CURRENT CODE IT'S JUST NOT FEASIBLE NOT PRACTICAL. IN THIS- PARTICULAR PROGRAM DOES TAKEN STEPS WITH FEDERATION THE VERY SITE SPECIFIC- GROUND MOTIONS. AND THOSE ARE GIVEN TO US BY THE USPS AND THE- CALIFORNIA GEOLOGICAL SURVEY. AND THAT ALSO AND THE BUILDING CODE SO THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS THAT AND THE STANDARDS THAT WE USE IN DETERMINING. THE SEISMICITY OF A LOCATION AND IT IS VERY- SUBSPECIFIC NOW SO POSSIBLY IN THE PAST AND LOOKING AT AS PC TO ANOTHER'S WHERE. IT WAS MORE OF A- A TRIAGE OR OR JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THIS BUILDING FRONT IN THE OVERALL SCHEME OF BUILDINGS OF THE SIMILAR NATURE- WE DO START TO DRILL IN TO GET A LOT. MORE SPICES SITE PACIFIC. AND ALSO WHEN I MENTION ABOUT A DESIGNER'S QUICK I DON'T. GIVE ME THAT EVERY FAULT. IT'S GOING TO HAVE AN EIGHT POINT. THE POINT WAS. SOFTBALL ARE ACTIVE OTHERS AND ARE GOING TO BE PRONE TO LARGER MAGNET. OF QUAKES AND OTHERS AND SO WE DO THINK THAT AND- AS HE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION OKAY APPRECIATE THAT AND FIND. OUT JUST A REALLY QUICK I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. I'M THE TWENTY TWENTY STANDARD REQUIRES US REQUIRED HOSPITALS TO REMAIN STANDING. IN IT IN A DESIGNER OF QUICK SO IN AN EIGHT POINT NO SO OR DESIGN STANDARD. SO YOUR REMAIN STANDING IN A LARGE EARTHQUAKE. CORRECT RIGHT SO AHEAD WE TALK ABOUT IS THE FULLY OPERATIONAL HOUSES ONE THAT HAS US THAT'S WHAT HAS THE COST EXPENSE FOR THESE HOSPITALS BUT I DON'T WANT THAT SO GET GOING THE MYSTICAL WE CAN ANSWER THE SIZE OF THE EARTHQUAKE YOU HAVE TO DO RIGHT I THINK THERE'S SOME CONFUSION AS TO WHAT IN THIS PC TO BUILDING ACTUALLY MEANS OKAY AS PC TO BUILDING 78% OF THE SPC TO BILLING FOR RE CATEGORIZE THROUGH FOR- HAS US. IN HOUSES WAS A PROGRAM DEVELOPED BY- FEMA ANGER OF WHAT'S CALLED HAZARDS U. S. AND THAT WAS INITIALLY AUTHORIZED FOR USE BY THEN GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER AS A SCREENING TOOL TO DETERMINE WHICH OF THESE SPC ONE BUILDINGS WERE THE WORST BUILDINGS THAT SHOULD HAVE IMMEDIATE ACTION TAKEN UPON THEM AND SO THAT SCREENING TOOL- DID NOT DRILL DOWN IN THE SITE SPECIFIC ASSIST FACILITY THAT- WE DON'T READ DRILL DOWN NOW ON WE HAD SOME DEALINGS FOR EXAMPLE THAT BECAME TO SEE TO BECAUSE THEY WERE ACTUALLY EVALUATED CALL VALUE IT. AND ALL ACTUALLY DRILL DOWN TO LOOK AT AND EVALUATE THOSE STRUCTURES DO THEY HAVE STRUCK DEFICIENCIES THAT CAN STILL REMAINING THAT COULD RESULT IN A PARTIAL COLLAPSE OR A PAGE UP FOR UP. FROM THE BEST WAY FOR ME TO THIS TO READ. FROM FEMA WHAT THIRD OF A OF A DUE TO BE AS A I MAY. BRIEF. IN THE IN THE HOUSE. PROBE THEY THE UNTIL WAS TO CREATE THESE SEAT GO INTO WHAT'S CALL A LIFE SAFETY LAW AND THIS IS THE DEFINITION OF LYE SAFETY BY FEMA LIFE SAFETY MEANS THE POST EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE STATE IN WHICH SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE STRUCTURE HAS OCCURRED BUT SOME MARGIN AGAINST EITHER PARTIAL OR TOTAL STRUCTURAL COLLAPSE REMAINS SOME STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS AND COMPONENTS MAY BE SEVERELY DAMAGED BUT SHOULD NOT RESULT IN LARGE FALLING DEBRIS HAZARDS EITHER WITHIN OR OUTSIDE THE BUILDING INJURIES MAY OCCUR DURING THE EARTHQUAKE HOWEVER IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE OVERALL RISK OF LIFE THREATENING INJURIES. AS A RESULT OF STRUCTURAL DAMAGE IS LAW COST TO REPAIR THE STRUCTURE. HOWEVER FOR ECONOMIC REASONS THIS MAY NOT BE PRACTICAL WHY THE DAM INSTRUCTOR IS NOT AN EMINENT COPS RISK. IT WOULD BE PRUDENT TO IMPLEMENT STRUCTURAL REPAIRS OR INSTALL BRACING PRIOR TO RE OCCUPANCY AND THAT'S FROM FEMA TWO SEVENTY THREE THAT. THAT'S A SPICY TOO RIGHT AND THE OTHER. IT'S A YEAH THAT'S RISKY SEE TO READ AND THEN WE NEED TO MOVE PEOPLE SPC FOR OUR FOR A FORTY RIGHT EXACTLY WHICH FORTY THEM WOULD. REDUCE SOME OF THESE RICH THAT I MENTIONED ARE FINE- FOR STC TO BILLS. AND THAT'S TO REMAIN OPERATIONAL. AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IN BALANCE IS WHAT IS IT AGAIN THE RISK TO THE PATIENT AND THE EMPLOYEE TO. SENATOR MY STANDARD VERSUS WHAT IT IS FULLY OPERATIONAL OR WHAT AN OPERATIONAL POST AN EARTHQUAKE AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THAT BALANCE IS WHAT WE BUILDING TO- IS THE- BUILDING- SO GOING TO. BE IN A SPACE WHERE AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE IT'S NOT A- IT'S NOT JEOPARDY TO AND CAN STILL MANAGED SERVICES SO I THINK WHEN I. TRY TO DRILL DOWN THOUGH AND IT IS THAT I THINK YOU KNOW AGAIN. TWENTY THIRTY YEARS CAN BE OPERATION. SONNY THAT TERMS OF THE- SIZE THE AFTER WORRY ABOUT. YOU ARE LOW. AT NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL ACROSS THE STATE YOU ARE TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE AXE SIZE RISK IN EACH INDIVIDUAL AREA. YES YOUR LETTER CORRECT. OKAY THAT'S THAT'S THE POINT I WAS TRYING TO CLARIFY AND THEN FINALLY- THAT- IS ALSO IS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT HOW STRUCTURAL IS THE BIG EXPENSE SO MOVING SB T. TO THE FORTY OR FIVE- BUT IN TERMS OF THE BURDEN OF ACTUALLY. BEYOND STRUCTURAL TRYING TO BE COMPLIANT WITH THE NONSTRUCTURAL STANDARDS. ARE THEIR MAJOR I MEAN I'M SURE THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS THAT SOME FINANCIAL BURDENS THAT HOW MUCH OF THAT CONCERN IS THAT SO ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE STRUCTURAL POINT THERE. THAN TRYING TO TRUSTS COME TO COMPLY TO NONSTRUCTURAL STANDARDS HOW MUCH OF A BURDEN IS THAT. IN OTHER REQUIRE. DO IT THE SAME TIME SO YOU DON'T REALLY SEPARATE THEM SO IF YOU HAVE A BUILDING SPC TO YOU DO THE NONSTRUCTURAL AS WELL SO IF YOU'RE REBUILDING YOU WOULD DO THE NONSTRUCTURAL AS WELL SURE RETROFITTING ANYONE OPENING. WE HAVE A LOT OF MONEY BUT IF THE I MEAN WE A LOT OF PEOPLE FOR A FORTY YEAR RIGHT IT MIGHT BE A NOW IT'S A PEOPLE READY AT FOR THE ARE FIVE THEY'RE FINE ARE AT THEIR DIVISIONAL INVESTMENTS THEY NEED TO MAKE TO. THE NYSE THEY MIGHT STILL HAVE BEEN PC TO DO BUT MOST OF THE TIME YOU DO IT TOGETHER OKAY WHAT ABOUT THIS FOR AWHILE OKAY SOUNDS THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE WELL THERE'S A BURDEN THAT SEEMS TO BE MANAGED. WELL WELL NOW THAT THAT'S QUITE YEAH THEIR LOVE WE TALKED OVER NON STROKE WRITING IF THIS AGAIN THIS IS WHERE YOU GET BY TO WHAT GOING ON WITH EACH DIFFERENT HOSPITAL SO YOU CAN HAVE A HOSPITAL THAT IS US THREE OR FOUR THAT HAS SIGNIFICANT NONSTRUCTURAL ISSUES AND NEED TO OPEN UP WALLS FOR THAT AND THIS IS WHERE I'M LOOKING AT PAUL ONLY BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW EVERY HOSPITAL IT TOO NEARING WHAT PULLS DO. ALSO OPERATIONAL STANDARDS INCLUDE. THE IN THE WATER YEAH THAT'S REQUIRED THAT COULD BE DEPENDING ON HOW AND WHEN THAT STORAGE IS REQUIRED THAT COULD BE AN ISSUE FOR THE HOSPITAL. I'M STORING THREE DAYS F FUEL COULD COULD CREATE SOME CHALLENGES AS WELL SO- I DEFERRED UPON THE ON THE- NONSTRUCTURAL BUT WE HAVE HEARD FROM OUR HOSPITALS THAT STUFF. CREATING SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL ISSUES TO RETROFIT TO THAT SPACE AS WELL OKAY. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. THINK THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN. JUST A QUESTION. HOW OFTEN ARE THIS SITE HOW HOW FOR THE SEISMIC STUDIES DONE AND HOW OFTEN DOES. IT LOOK AT THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT BECAUSE I'M HEARING ROM A HOSPITAL CEO HERE THAT THEY WENT OUT AND DID THEIR OWN SEISMIC THAT APPEAL TO YOU SO THAT DOESN'T. FEEL RIGHT SOMEHOW WE'RE RECORD- SO HELLO. STAND THAT. TYPICALLY THE HOSPITALS WILL DO WILK- CONTRACT WITH DESTRUCTION DURING FIRM. TO DO SEISMIC EVALUATIONS ON THEIR SITE. AND A MAN INVOLVED YOUR TECHNICAL- INVESTIGATIONS AS WELL. WITH REGARDS TO SOIL IN SEISMICITY. AND THEN THEY WILL SUBMIT THAT TO US FOR OUR REVIEW. AND IN SOME CASES- THE HOSTELS IN OR NEAR MAY COME UP WITH. THE WORK THAT WE FEEL IS- ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT'S ACTUALLY NEEDED- HOWEVER IF THE HOSPITAL AS WANTING TO DO THAT MUCH WORK THAN THAT IT'S ALLOWED- FOR EXAMPLE ON. ON THE. I WON WITH BLUE. AND RIVER FOR EXAMPLE I. YOU KNOW I'M I'M CURIOUS AS TO THE PURPOSE OF THE MICHAEL PILES IN A ONE STORY BUILDING SO THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE NEED HAS FOR THE DISCUSSION ON SO- YEAH WE DO WE DO LOOK AT THAT AND WE DO QUESTION IT AND SOMETIMES WE WILL. BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES TO HOSPITALS AS TO MAYBE LESS EXPENSIVE WAYS TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE THEN WHAT- THEIR INJURES MAY HAVE HAVE COME UP WITH SO I GUESS I GUESS WHAT I GUESS WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH THEM IS A LITTLE BIT. IS THAT. AND I AND I DON'T WANT TO GET. IT YOU KNOW I JUST. THAT IS A HOSPITAL PEOPLE YOU PROBABLY. ARE PROBABLY A LITTLE. RELUCTANT TO POKE AT THE PAIR- QUITE FRANKLY. AND I THE I WOULD BE- BUT BUT I'M TRYING TO. WELL I'M YOU KNOW I'M SERIOUS I AM BEING SERIOUS SO I'M NOT YOU PERSONALLY MISTER COLEMAN- BUT- BUT I DO BECAUSE OF REGULATORS AND I AND I DO. SO I AM I AM. I AM WONDERING IF. SO YOU. PRETTY YOU GOT TO READ HOSPITALS TO BILL DOLLARS THIS IS A SAFETY NET HOSPITAL SO WE ALREADY KNOW THE DISEASE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES- IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BUILD THAT WHERE THE RESEARCH COMES FROM AND THAT'S A BIG QUESTION ABOUT ASKING FOR AN ANSWER BUT THAT IS A BIG QUESTION HERE BUT I'M ALSO A LITTLE YOU KNOW IF WE IS THERE REQUIRE. THIS AND AT OUR BY STATUTE IN AND LOS. THAT I DO WONDER. ARE WE- ARE WE NOT- WHITE WHERE WE NOT DO BEING A LITTLE BIT MORE- SO WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR- PROGRESSIVE IN THE WAY WE LOOK AT- AS TIMES CHANGE AND SCIENCE CHANGES AND THINGS SO I'M NOT I'M NOT ENGINEERS NO IN. A YOU KNOW I GOT LIKE I CAN BOUNCE MY BOOK- AND I AND I. AM LOOKING FOR BIG. THROUGH A BIG PICTURE OF. SURVIVABILITY HERE I THINK OF THE NATURAL DISASTERS IN MY DISTRICT- AND THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL- MOST RECENTLY FIRES AND I THINK OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE EVACUATED. AND THE HOSPITAL STAFF AND THE AND THE DOCTORS AND EVERY DID FABULOUS JOBS MEAN NO NO NO REAL BAD OUTCOMES OF ANYTHING THAT I'M AWARE OF AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAJOR EVACUATIONS- I WONDER IF AT SOME POINT. WE HAVE A HOSPICE. THAT'S FIVE EIGHT POINT OH EARTHQUAKE BUT BECAUSE OF COMMUNITIES AND- YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE A DOCTOR TO GET THERE. YOU DON'T HAVE STAFF WHO CAN GET THAT IN MANY CASES OUR CAN WITH THE FIRES BECAUSE OF ELECTRICITY. LACK OF **** IN CASES WATER BECAUSE OF RURAL RURAL AREAS BIG RELY ON PUMPS- THEIR WELLS. WE GO TO WORK AS THAT SCHOOL IN SESSION AND SO I FOR ME I'M LOOKING FOR THIS BALLOT IS SAYS WE ABSOLUTELY HOSPO SURVIVE IN A OVER BUT WE ALSO KNOW TO KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT CREE AS AT WE IT EVEN IF IT SURVIVE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO RUN HOSPITAL BECAUSE- UP. OF THE OF THE PEACE NOW NOT A SKIN FOR AN ANSWER I'M JUST I'M JUST KIND OF KIND OF KIND MAKING A STATEMENT THERE- I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THE COMMUNITY REGIONAL IS A HUGE ECONOMIC DRIVER FOR THAT FOR THE FRESNO REGION- WHERE HE NOTED THAT SIXTY MILLION IN REVENUE FROM CINEMA VALLEY WITH A MAP IN THAT RIVER- CLOSE. FIVE THIS IS A RECALL. SEVENTY EIGHT SEC. BECAUSE ADDED UP UP BUT I GUESS FOR ME A PART OF THIS IS AT THE KNOW IS THERE ARE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THIS OR IS EVERYTHING HOW IS EVERYTHING GOING TO BE. YOU KNOW EXACTLY AS AS ENGINEERS AND EVERYONE TO CREATE WHAT WE WOULD POTENTIALLY LOOK AT AREAS WHERE IN A HOSPITAL CEASE TO EXIST BECAUSE THERE IS NO ABILITY TO FINANCE THEM SO WITH THREE EXAMPLES HERE I WONDER HOW MANY OF THEM ARE GOING TO- BE ABLE TO SEE I'VE AND WHAT'S THAT MEAN FOR A COMMUNITY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR CAN WHEN YOU LOSE A HOSPITAL- IN ONE COMMUNITY I'M NOT ONE OF THESE- SMALL COAST HOSPITAL- THREE HUNDRED EMPLOY THREE AND PEOPLE WORK FOR THE HOSPITAL TO THE THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE WORK FOR THE HOSPITAL- IN A SMALL SMALL TOWN- WHEN PEOPLE AYE POSSIBLE SERVICES IS. THERE THEY'RE REMOVE CLOSER TO SERVICES SUB. I'M NOT I'M NOT AND WITH THIS BE CRITICAL AND NOT AND NOT POKING IT. AT THINGS. BUT I'M WE'RE KIND OF LOOKING FOR A BIG SOLUTION HERE THAT THAT BALANCES THE SAFETY AND EVERYTHING. BUT DOESN'T PUT ESPECIALLY SOME OF OUR SAFETY NET HOSPITALS AND RURAL HOSPITALS OUT OF BUSINESS- SOMETIMES WITH I FEEL LIKE A PART I JUST REALLY FEEL LIKE A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY- I DON'T NEED. TO WHISPER THAT IT YES. AND SO THAT'S THE THAT'S A CONCERN WE HAVE SO. SHE THAT SORRY THAT WAS A BIT OF A SOAP BOX. BUT A MORE STATEMENT AND THEN. SO QUESTION SO ANY QUESTIONS THIS WELL A QUESTION. OKAY OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE REALLY PROJECT UP. BUT OKAY AND ACTUALLY IS THIS- PANELS LEAVING AYE I WOULD I WOULD ALSO JUST MAKE NOTE TO AND I APPRECIATE- CHAIR WOODS COMMENTS- WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HOSPITALS AND THE COMMUNITY AND DURING DISASTERS BUT I THINK BECAUSE I THINK- MY THINGS ALSO WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT- WE HAVE THE STANDS WE NEED TO HOSPITALS THERE AND SOME OF THE HOSPITAL'S DISAPPEAR EVEN BEFORE DISASTER WE HAVE LOST SOMETHING- JOBS ACCESSTO HEALTH CARE CENTER. ALL RIGHT SO OUR NEXT PANEL IS. ON HEALTH CARE PROVIDER CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE AND I WANT TO WELCOME UP STEPHANIE ROBERSON DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION. JIM ONES- MEMBER AT AT- FROM TARZANA MEDICAL CENTER AND MEMBER OF S. YEAH YOU AND ALSO SAYS ARE DIAZ LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR OF STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL WELCOME AND APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND ASK THAT IF YOU COULD AND- LIKE THE OTHER WITNESSES IF YOU TRY TO KEEP YOUR REMARKS TO THREE MINUTES FOR YOUR PRESENTATION OF SURE WILL HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES- AFTERWARDS WITH QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WELCOME. THANK OU FOR THE INTRODUCTION- OF A GERMAN. GERMAN WOOD TRIM AND PAN. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- AND STAFF STEPHANIE ROBERSON ON BEHALF OF THE CNA- I WANT TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE I WANT TO BRING UP THE NUMBER OF MINE WHO- WORKS AND- QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL IN NAPA. WHERE THE SEISMIC EVENT HIT VARGAS OF LAST YEAR WITH EXPERIENCE FLOODING DOORS COMING OFF ITS HINGES ON HOW THEY LOST ONE LIFE AND OVER TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE SUSTAIN INJURIES AND I BET BECAUSE ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGE THAT COMMUNITY CELS AS YOU KNOW- CHAIRMAN THAT WAS A QUITE A DEVASTATING EVENT. BUT BEFORE SHE CAN BE THERE TODAY AND OFFERS HER APOLOGIES- AS YOU KNOW FROM THE GOOD BACKGROUND MATERIALS THAT YOU ALL HAVE BEEN HAVE REPAIR THE HOSPITAL INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA FIRST BECAME AWARE OF THE DIRE CONSEQUENCES OF ALLOW. MOST TIES WITH BEEN SICK SINCE THE SEVENTIES. QUICKLY SEVENTY FOUR. THE ALFORD ALQUIST SEISMIC WAS IN INTO TO PLAY. SAFETY ON THE INDUSTRY'S TOP PRIORITY LIST FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. AND REQUIRE THEM TO PLAN ACCORDINGLY. ON THIS LAW WAS IN RESPONSE TO SILMAR QUAKE THATKILLED OVER SIXTY PEOPLE AND CLAPS ONE HOSPITAL. THE INDUSTRY ESSENTIALLY IGNORED THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND HOW HAVE THEY- BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THEIR BEEN SCORES OF SEISMIC SAFETY BILLS- PASSED ON THE BOOKS CA SEVEN. BIG MAJOR BILLS BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY NINE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND MANY OTHER SMALLER EXTENSION BILLS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE THAT GIVEN THE INDUSTRY. THESE EXTENSIONS EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW HOW SIZE AND KLAY ACTIVE THIS STATE IS THE FIRST ACTUAL EVENT WAS RECORDED IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY NINE. BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO THOUSAND FOR A DAMAGING SEISMIC EVENT. OCCURRED AVERAGE AT LEAST SPUR GEAR. CREST AS YOU KNOW HOW LAST JULY. AROUND THE SAME TIME THIS IS. COUNT AT A SEISMIC RELIEF BILL WAS PROPOSED. IT'S ABOUT A FEW DAYS ON BAR SO CALIFORNIA. PLEASE X. EARTHQUAKE HIT. SO I WANT ABOUT SOME THINGS ARE ALL IF YOU WILL IS AT YOU DON'T KNOW THE ACCESS TO TAX EXEMPT FIND A BY TAX DOLLARS HOSPITAL FEES WHICH SEE MORE FROM OUR HOUSE. IT IS THE SAME HOSPITALS THAT USE THESE FUNDS AREN'T RETURNING SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF CHARITY CARE DOLLARS BACK TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE. THESE ARE SOME OF THE SAME HOSPITALS THAT RECEIVE TAX EXEMPT BONDS. AND IN THE PAST DIDN'T USE A PENNY FOR SEISMIC RETROFIT. WE ARE IN TWENTY TWENTY AND WE FINALLY ARE CLOSING IN ON RETROFITTING SOME OF THE MOST DANGEROUS BUILDINGS LIKELY THE PANCAKE AND EXCITEMENT IN THAT WE'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN. NURSES ARE IN THE STREETS AT THESE INANCING MEETINGS AND AT LOCAL CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS. I DON'T WANT. A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON SEISMIC COMPLIANT. WHEN AN ENTITY ACQUIRES A HOSPITAL USUALLY THESE DAYS AS A HEDGE FUND. THEY HAVE NO PLANS TO RUN THESE HOSPITALS AS HOSPITALS. THE FIRST TELL THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT THEY CAN'T MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SALE THAT MEANS SEISMIC THAT MEANS WOMEN'S HEALTH- KEEPING CERTAIN DEPARTMENTS OPEN STAFF OBLIGATIONS ALL OF THAT. IN THE G. IS DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB PUSHING VERY HARD TO MAKE THESE NEW BUYERS PONY UP ON CONDITIONS- RECENT DEALS THAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD IN THE NEWS AYE KPCC WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY OWNED BY VERITY WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY OWNED BY DAUGHTERS OF CHARITY. FELL THROUGH WHEN BANKRUPTCY COURT THIS DYNAMIC MEMBERS WE FEEL IS A HUGE PROBLEM AND IT HAS RESULTED IN THE OLDEST HOSPITAL AND LOS ANGELES CLOSING ST VINCENT'S HOSPITAL. I DON'T THINK A REBUILD WILL HAPPEN- AND WE HAVE HIGHLY TRAINED TRADESMAN READY TO DO THE WORK. THIS FULL SERVICE HOSPITAL WILL BE LIKELY REPAIR PLACE BY PSYCH SERVICES MUCH NEEDED DEFINITELY BUT WE LOSE YET ANOTHER FULL SERVICE HOSPITAL. ALSO WERE FIGHTING IN HOSPITALS WANT TO CONTINUE TO COME TO THE LEGISLATURE AND ASK FOR RELEASED WE HAVE TO SCRUTINIZE MORE I THINK YOU'RE DOING THAT. DEFINITELY DOING THAT'S NOT A CRITICISM BUT WE NEED TO DO MUCH MORE ANOTHER REAL IMPACT AND SEISMIC COMPLIANCE IS EVIDENCED BY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILL NAME THE FACILITIES BUT- STRUGGLING AUSTAL AA IS SEEKING A BONTA PAY FOR SEISMIC. FINANCING MEANWHILE UP STRUGGLING HOSPITAL WAY IS SEEKING THIS BOND MEANWHILE I FINANCIALLY SOLVENT HOSPITAL BE IS RUNNING AN ACTIVE CAMPAIGN TODAY TO HAVE VOTERS WORK AGAINST THE MEASURE BECAUSE HOSPITAL BE ONCE ALL THE PATIENTS. THUS STRUGGLING HOSPITAL A THAT IS A PROBLEM. I THINK THAT HI THAT ACTIVITY SHOULD BE DENOUNCED AND I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE PUT TO STOP IMMEDIATELY. COMMUNITIES DESERVE MORE WE TALK ABOUT WORK FORCE IN THIS BUILDING AND WHAT HAPPENS THE NEXT TIME THE HOSPITAL CLOSES OR GETS ACQUIRED BY HEDGE FUND WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE PATIENTS. WHAT HAPPENS ARE HIGHLY TRAINED WORKFORCE WHAT'S THE RIVER RESULT. AND WE BELIEVE A REPUTABLE DEVASTATION TO THE FABRIC AND THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. ARE WITH RESPECT TO THE TWENTY THIRTY STANDARD AND ALL CLOSE- IN THE POSSIBILITY FOR CHANGES TO THE INTEGRITY OF THE SEISMIC SAFETY LAW WE BELIEVE SHOULD NEVER BE EXPLORED. TO MUCH DIFFERENT STANDARD THAN EXTENSION CURRENT PROPOSALS BY THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION SEEK TO UNDERMINE ALIVE BY ENSURING WHICH YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD- IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS CERTAIN PARTS OF THE HOSPITAL. TO REMAIN STANDING AFTER AND THE EXCITEMENT THAT. HOSPITALS ARE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW MALL STRIP MALLS WE BELIEVE ALL THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY NEEDS TO OBVIOUSLY HAPPEN. BUT THIS IS WHERE. PATIENTS WORKERS THE PUBLIC VISITORS COME IN. AND WE NEED THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE PROVIDING THE TREATMENT THAT'S LINKED TO ALL THE ESSENTIAL SERVICES YOU CAN'T HAVE A FEW ESSENTIAL SERVICES NOT. TO THE REST AND MAKES NO SENSE TO US. SO DO TO THAT IN DUE TO PATIENTS WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET OUT DOING DUE TO THEIR MOBILITY WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A NO GO ON POLICY- PLEASE CONSIDER. THESE THOUGHTS AS YOU MOVE FORWARD ON THIS AND WE HAVE STRONG CONCERNS THIS BILL THIS TO. A SIZE SIX TEAMS FOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR. THANK YOU. X. WITNESSED. VETERANS MY NAME IS JIM I'M GONNA READ NURSE FOR FOUR YEARS I IN SO FERNANDO IN I WORK AT TARZANA HOSPITAL I'VE WORKED IN ALMOST EVERY DEPARTMENT IN THE HOSPITAL EXCEPT FOR LABOR AND DELIVERY AND WOMEN'S. WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES SO THE ONLY ONES I COULDN'T GO TO I'VE LIVED MY ENTIRE LIFE IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY AND I REMEMBER WHEN THE EARTHQUAKE OF SEVENTY ONE HIT IT WAS MY SENIOR YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL WE SAW THE GROUND COMING IN WAYS HOW IT LIFTED UP OUR HOME AND DROPPED IT ON. WE LIVE IN EARTHQUAKE WERE YOU TO IT. IN NINETEEN. THERE WAS FILLED WITH THE SOUNDS OF. GLASS CRACKLING IN EXPLODING MY WIFE'S- PINK GLASS COLLECTION TOTALLY WENT INTO THE KITCHEN. I TRIED TO CALL THE HOSPITAL BUT I COULDN'T GET THROUGH THERE WAS NO TELEPHONE LINE AT THAT TIME AND THERE WAS NO CELLPHONES BACK THEN. PEOPLE WERE PANICKING MY WIFE TOLD ME GO GET SOME WATER I WENT OUT AND PEOPLE WERE DRIVING. THROUGH THE INTERSECTION WITH NO LIGHTS AND COMPLETELY. AT FULL SPEED SERVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS PANICKED. ONCE I FINALLY DID GET. INTO THE HOSPITAL ALL ELECTIVE SURGERIES HAVE BEEN CANCELED THE EMERGENCY ROOM. WAS COMPLETELY PACKED WITH PATIENTS AND INJURED AND PEOPLE WERE COMING IN TO BE TREATED. ON MY WAY INTO THE HOSPITAL THERE WAS APARTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN COLLAPSED. AT THAT YOU CAN SEE RIGHT OFF OF THE FREEWAY AT RECEIVABLE OF ART. OUR HOSPITAL UNLIKE MANY OF THE OTHERS WERE STANDING WE TREAT US TO PATIENTS AND AS THE AFTERSHOCKS WARM WE COULD WATCH THE IV POLE SWAY. AND WE COULD PICK HOW HOW HEAVY THAT EARTHQUAKE ACTUALLY WAS FOLLOWING AT. AND EACH ONE CAME IN THE EMERGENCY IN AN EMERGENCY OF THIS MAGNITUDE HOSPITALS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE COMMUNITY. WE ARE THE ONLY LIFE LINE OF OUR COMMUNITY AN EMERGENCY SITUATION. HOSPITALS IN THE PLACE WITH THE INJURED WHO TRADED WHERE PEOPLE IN DISTRESS CAN RECEIVE COMFORT AND WHERE THOSE WERE SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER COME TO. WE HAD MANY PEOPLE COME IN THE AND DONE ONLY HAD PHYSICAL INJURIES BUT WERE PURE PANICKED. AND SO THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR IT. BABY STILL NEED TO BE BORN THERE'S STILL COMING IN FOR LABOR AND DELIVERY STROKES HEART ATTACKS BURST APPENDIX CONTINUE TO HAPPEN WE STILL HAD EMERGENCY SURGERY. YESTERDAY BEFORE I LEFT THE HOSPITAL I HAD SIX EMERGENCY SURGERIES THAT I HAD TO RECOVER. THOSE WITH THINGS THAT COULDN'T GO AWAY THAT HAD TO BE DONE AND THEY WOULD HAVE SHOWN UP IF WE HAD AN EARTHQUAKE THAT DAY. A GROUP THAT. CRITICAL CARE WORKING NEVER PULSE. I HAVE FRIENDS WHO WORK AT NORTHRIDGE HOSPITAL WHEN THE TRIAGE WAS SET UP IN THE PARKING LOT THE PATIENTS WERE ALL TAKEN OUT OF THE HOSPITAL NORTHRIDGE'S A LARGER HOSPITAL IN TARZANA. AND THE PATIENTS WERE OUT IN THE PARKING LOT FOR IT THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND IF YOU CAN POSSIBLY AVOID IT YOU DO NOT WANT TO ALL OF A SUDDEN HAVE TRAUMATIZED PEOPLE OUT IN AN AREA WHERE YOU'RE LITERALLY GOING YOU'RE GOOD YOU'RE BAD YOU'RE GONE. THAT'S IT. LIVES ARE LOST WHEN A HOSPITAL CANNOT BE FULLY FUNCTIONAL. IT WAS THIS EVENT THE MOTIVATED CALIFORNIA TO ASSESS THIS SAFETY OF ITS COMMUNITIES IN AN EMERGENCY REQUIRE THAT MOST AT RISK HOSPTALS BE RETROFITTED AND UPGRADED TO WITHSTAND THE DAMAGE. IT IS A HARD WON WISDOM ALLOW BORN A PAINFUL EXPERIENCE AND WE CANNOT WE CAN A- SUMMER PROPOSAL WE YOU CAN READ TRIPIT PART OF A HOSPITAL EXPOSE RESTED CATASTROPHES. A COMPLEX SYSTEM LIKE A HOSPITAL WORKS IN MANY WAYS HOW CAN AN EMERGENCY ROOM FUNCTION IF THE SUPPLY ROOM IS COLLAPSED IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. HOW CAN THE RECOVERY ROOM IF YOU CANNOT PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH PART IN WORK TOGETHER OUR PARTS ALL WORK TOGETHER IF I DO NOT HAVE THE LAB TO TAKE IN TELL ME WHAT THE PATIENT'S HEMOGLOBIN AS I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE TO TRY TO GET SOME BLOOD TO GIVE THAT PATIENT THAT COMES TO ME IN THE RECOVERY. ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAVE TO TUNE IN WHEN. SURGERY HAS PATIENTS IF AT THE EARTHQUAKE TIME. AND THEY WE- HAVE THE STRUCTURE IN PLACE FOR THE E. R. TO GET THE PATIENT. THE PATIENT COMES TO SURGERY AND COMES TO US. I GET HIM IN RECOVERY ROOM AND I FILL UP TO. THE SPACES THAT WE HAVE IN THE RECOVERY ROOM YET. THE FLOORS ARE NOT CAPABLE OF TAKING THEM. THEN EVERYTHING STOPS. WE CANNOT TAKE IN ANOTHER PATIENT SO THE FLOW OF THOSE STRUCTURES WITH IN THE HOSPITAL AND I DO UNDERSTAND. THAT EACH HOSPITALS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN THAT FLOW IN EACH COMMUNITY. BUT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETELY FUNCTION WITHIN THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE IT. HOSPITALS HAVE HAD A QUARTER OF A CENTURY TO COMPLY WITH THIS LAW. SOME HAVE SUMMER THRIVING BUT OTHERS HAVE EVEN AS THEY'VE BEEN REWARDED FOR THEIR PAYOFFS TO SEE CEOS I WORK FOR TENET HEALTHCARE. AND THAT OKAY THANK YOU AND WE WILL ENSURE TO BE MORE IT'S JUST OPPORTUNITIES WHEN YOU IN A- SERBIAN SO EACH EACH WITNESSES TEND TO GO MORE OUT FIVE MINUTES YOU CAN. STEP THANK YOU I'LL I'LL I'LL TRY TO KEEP IT BRIEF- HARD TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE- PREVIOUS TESTIMONY- STRUCTURE- BUT WE ARE THANKFUL TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY HERE TO ADDRESS- OF THE JOINT- COMMITTEE- AND TO DISCUSS THE MANY ISSUES AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO THOSE ISSUES PRESENTED BY HOSPITALS ORGANIZED LABOR. AND OF COURSE STAKEHOLDERS- I SHOULD BEGIN UP FRONT BY SITTING THAT WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF MAINTAINING CALIFORNIA'S REQUIREMENT TO BUILD AND OPERATE HOSPITALS TO MEET THE SEISMIC STANDARDS. OF COURSE SUCH COMPLIANCE OF COMING FROM THE STABLE INJURIES IS THE SECRET WE DOWANNA. BUILD THOSE BUILDINGS AND REPRESENT A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR A LOT OF MEN WOMEN AND APPRENTICES ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THAT'S NOT ALL OUR ENTIRE INVOLVED IN AS WELL- MUCH OF THE WORK INVOLVED IN HOSPITAL CONSTRUCTION IS SIMILAR TO ANY OTHER LARGE SCALE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. THESE PROJECTS HOWEVER ARE ALSO COMPLEX AND REQUIRE HIGH LEVELS OF POSITION AND SKILLS FROM VARIOUS CONSTRUCTION CROPS. AS YOU'VE HEARD CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS AND ACCESS TO FINANCING FOR HOSPITAL MEDICAL FACILITIES PRESENT UNIQUE CHALLENGES. TO DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION TEAMS. IN ADDITION TO SEISMIC REQUIREMENTS NEW PROJECTS ARE ALSO BUILDING TO LEAD STANDARDS FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY USING HEALTHY BUILDING MATERIALS INSTALLING WATER CONSERVATION SYSTEMS INCORPORATING FILTERED OUTSIDE AIR SYSTEMS ARE RESULT. IN A SETTING THAT PROMOTES THE HEALTH OF SAFETY A HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PATIENTS STAFF AND VISITORS. CREATIVE CONTRACTING INCLUDING INTEGRATED PROJECT DELIVERY TEAMS THE USE OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODEL OR BAM. MEDICAL GAS PURITY PIPING SEISMIC BRACING AN AWESOME BED SPECIALTY TRADE TEAMS ARE ALL ASPECTS OF TODAY'S HOSPITAL CONSTRUCTION. HOWEVER NO ONE DISPUTES THAT A HOSPITAL PROJECT THAT IT HERE'S TO LOCAL STATE AND BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS IS MORE LIKELY TO WITHSTAND AN EMERGENCY. SITUATION AND HAVING AND HAVING THE BEST TRAINED WORKERS BUILDING THE FACILITY WILL HELP INSURE QUALITY AND STABILITY. WE DID ALL- HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE IN THIS AND A GERMAN MENTIONED ON TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT OR SO WHEN WOMEN ARE SORE TEENAGER CONVENED- A SERIES OF MEETINGS ACROSS THE STATE. WE WERE PART OF THOSE MEETINGS BACK WE PARTNER WITH THE LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY. VERY STAKEHOLDERS TO ORGANIZE WHAT WE CALL THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE CONSTRUCTION SUMMIT. THE PURPOSE OF THE SUMMIT WAS TO BRING HOSPITAL OWNERS GENERAL CONTRACTORS SUBCONTRACTORS AND BUILDING TRADES WRAPS. TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY AND FIND SOLUTIONS THE MAIN ISSUES AND CHALLENGES AT THE TIME THAT INVOLVED HOSPITAL HEALTH CARE FACILITY CONSTRUCTION. I MENTION THIS AS AN OTION TO ESTABLISH A SIMILAR CONVENING AIMED AT ADDRESSING THE ISSUES RAISED TODAY. WE SHOULD EXPLORE STREAMLINING FOR PROJECT DELIVERY THAT SAVES TIME AND HOSPITAL RESOURCES. AND THE RESULTING COMPLIANCE WITH SEISMIC REQUIREMENTS. WE'RE LOOKING TO LIKE SITUATIONS LIKE AB NINE HUNDRED THE ENVIRONMENTAL OF PROJECTS LEADERSHIP PROJECTS WHERE THERE'S- JUDICIAL REVIEW THAT SHORTEN- WE'RE LOOKING AT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FINANCING AUTHORITY IN SEEING HOW YOU CAN EXPAND ACCESS TO THOSE RESOURCES- WE SUGGEST THE STATE WIDE BOND- WE'VE ALL KIND OF KNOWN ABOUT THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD AND WHAT IT DOES FOR SCHOOLS IN TERMS OF MATCHING FUNDS. WHY NOT EXPAND THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO A LOT OF THESE HOSPITALS THAT ARE TRYING TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE HAVING OR STRUGGLING WITH FINANCING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY HEROES OF MENTIONED BY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES- CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS BOTH THE FINANCING BUT ALSO NOT- SACRIFICE HEALTH AND SAFETY IS ALSO CRITICAL HERE SO WE URGE- THAT CONVENING TO TAKE PLACE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS QUESTIONS. OF A CHURCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR YOUR PERSPECTIVES AND INFORMATION I APPRECIATE MISTER DE AS A- BOB MY QUESTION WAS GOING TO BE OKAY. WHAT DO WE DO- WE HAVE MANY HOT WE HAVE MANY HOSPITALS NOT NOT ALL HOSPICE WE HAVE WE HAVE MANY HOSPITAL CERTAINLY SO MANY IN MY DISTRICT THAT ARE STRUGGLING JUST TO REMAIN VIABLE AND OPEN AS THEY ARE. LET ALONE MEETING THE SAFETY STANDARDS- THAT ARE COMING- AND- IF FOR SOME OF THEM THIS MAY BE THE STRAW THAT BREAKS THE CAMEL'S BACK AND SO- APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE OFFERED- SOME SOLUTIONS THERE AT. A STATEWIDE BOND- COULD BE THE MOTHER OF ALL STATEWIDE BONDS- IF THE NUMBERS BETWEEN THIRTY TWO BILLION AND A HUNDRED AND WHATEVER. GOT THE THAT NUMBER- OUT THERE WOULD BE PRETTY PRETTY. PRETTY BIG BOND- MAYBE BEYOND OUR CAPACITY AS A STATE QUITE FRANKLY- I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT BE QUESTION FOR OTHER PEOPLE BUT I IN THAT THERE ARE OTHER RESOURCES AS WELL SO. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- NOT THAT OF COURSE LOOKING AT SCHOOL FACILITY BONDING IS IT IS THE ONLY OPTION AGO BUT- SINCE LIKE EARLY TWO THOUSAND MAYBE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL SCHOOL BONDS- A YEAR YOU ARE LOOKING AT A- A CONSTRUCTION- TO A PROGRAM THAT HAS MATCHING FUNDS THAT HAS. SORT RAGED. THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS HERSELF IN STATE FINANCING WITH MATCHING FUNDS AND OTHER FEDERAL RESOURCES. THAT CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE THAT AMOUNT- TAX EXEMPT FINANCING AND CONDUIT FINANCING IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT COULD BE LOOKED AT IN EXPANDED. AS WELL AS YOU KNOW SOME STREAMLINING FROM SOME OF THE LOCAL APPROVAL PROCESSES AS ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS AS YOU. YOU KNOW WE KNOW WE FULL WELL WHAT IT MEANS FOR STADIUMS WHAT IT COULD MEAN FOR SPECIFIC HOSPITAL PROJECT WITHOUT SACRIFICING ACTUAL SEQUEL BUT- HELPING COMPLIANCE- AND STREAMLINING MOVE THE PROJECT FASTER. DO EITHER WOULD EITHER YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO ADD TO THAT. THANK YOU MISTER DE AS A CHRISTIAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY BROTHER AND SISTER DE IS OVER HERE I'M IN PART OF MY COMMENTS I MENTION CHAFF THAT CALIFORNIA HEALTH FACILITIES FINANCING AUTHORITY I MEAN THESE BONDS HAVE BEEN DETECTED THEM BONTA BEEN USE NUMEROUS TIMES. IN FACT I THINK CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS AND SOME OTHERS THEY RELEASE SEVERAL BONDS OVER TIME I THINK THE NEXT PHASE OF THEIR FUNDING IS MOVING SO THAT IS DEFINITELY A VIABLE OPTION TO EXPLORE SO I WOULD JUST ECHO THOSE COMMENTS AND THEN OBVIOUSLY KEEPING THE OPPORTUNITIES OPEN FOR THE LOCALS TO. HIM TAX THE LOCALS WITHOUT INTERRUPTION WOULD BE HELPFUL TO KEEP THESE HOSPITALS OPEN WHAT I TO DO YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN I APPRECIATE THAT TOO I DO WONDER I MEAN SOME OF MY RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE POOR- TAX. IT'S HARD TO SQUEEZE MONEY OUT OF WHERE THERE IS A MONEY AND SO WHEN I START THINKING ABOUT SAFETY NET HOSPITALS AND RURAL HOSPITALS THAT. I'M ALREADY STRUGGLING THE BONDS AND THOSE ARE THAT'S GREAT BUT I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE HOW IF THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH THAT AND THEN YOU ADD BOND PAYMENTS ON TOP OF THAT I'M SURE THAT HOW WE HOW WE GET THERE AND SO I APPRECIATE APPRECIATE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM BUT I. NOT ALL HOSPITALS ARE CREATED EQUAL- NOT ALL OF SEISMIC ZONES ARE CREATED EQUAL AND- AND- YOU KNOW I'M I'M NOT AN ADVOCATE FOR ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH IS TO- COMPLEX PROBLEMS AND SO- I THAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE LOOKING REALLY HOLISTICALLY AND EVERYTHING AS WE DO THIS. THANK YOU FOR. HAVE QUESTIONS YES A SUMMER. LIKE JUST SAVE THOUGHTS IT IS FROM. AND I JUST I JUST FOR. AND MAYBE YOUR INPUT TO THAT WHEN I TO THE HOSPITAL'S MY JUST I'VE ONE HOSPITAL THAT WAS GOING TO THE SEISMIC YOU KNOW UPGRADES AND THEN THEY HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLANS AND IT ENDED UP THEY DID A BOND AND BUILT A BRAND NEW HOSPITAL RATHER THAN TRY. DO WITH OLD TOWER AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THEY HAD- SO WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THAT. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE OLD FACILITY BUT I HAVE ANOTHER HOSPITAL THAT IS NEW. THAT ACTUALLY WHEN WE TOURED IT- THEY HAVE DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE KIND OF SWITCH OFF AND USE IN A DIFFERENT WAY. SO WHEN YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT. MAYBE PRIORITIZING CERTAIN AREAS TO BE YOU KNOW SEISMICALLY RETROFIT IN LEAVING THE OTHERS. IN A WAITING THEM YOU KNOW WHEN- YOU MENTIONED ABOUT THE SUPPLY ROOM THAT'S A THOUGHT PROVOKING THING BECAUSE IT MADE ME THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS ONE THE HOSPITAL. USES THIS AREA FOR- A RECOVERY ROOM SOMETIMES AND AS YOU KNOW SOME TYPES OF OTHER SERVICE I CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS- OTHER TIMES SO. IT'S NOT LIKE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD ISOLATED TO CERTAIN AREAS THAT NEED TO BE. YOU KNOW THE RETRO FITTED VERSUS OTHERS. AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SEE THAT ANOTHER BUT THAT THE- THOUGHT OF THE SUPPLY ROOM BEING THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE SOMETHING THAT WOULDN'T BE PRIORITIZED GENERALLY I DON'T KNOW. WE'VE DONE THAT AT OUR FACILITY WHERE. DURING THE DAY THE CATH LAB THE- CARDIO VASCULAR LAB HAS THE RECOVERY AREA AND THEN AT NIGHT THEY OF CONVERTED THAT OVER TO AN URGENT CARE AREAS SO THAT THEY TOOK PRESSURE OFF OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM. YEAH THAT'S WHAT I THINK THE IS THE ONE AREAS A TRIAGE OR- THE OVER FLOW FROM THE EMERGENCY ROOM SOMETIMES AND AS WE COVER ROOM OTHER TIMES. SO THAT AREA MIGHT BE NOT NECESSARILY PRIORITIZED IF YOU LOOK AT IT IN ONE USE THE COULD BE IN ANOTHER. SOME. NINE THANK YOU- AND I ALSO THINK THE- OUR PRESENTERS HERE I MEAN I THINK WE'VE REFERENCED EARLIER IN THE HEARING- THE IMPORTANT ROLE- HOSPO OFTEN PLAYS IN THE COMMUNITY. DURING A DISASTER BEYOND WHAT THE NORMALLY VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN A HOSPITAL PLYS IN- JUST IN EVERYDAY LIFE AND THEN THE ROLE AND CERTAINLY STAFF THAT WORK IN THE HOSPITAL AND- AND IN A NO THERE LAW HOSPITALS AND THERE ARE MANY OF THEM IN VARIOUS STATE SOMEWHERE DOING VERY WELL OTHERS. AREN'T SO BE SO WELL- AND I THINK THAT IS- BUT- WHEN A DISASTER STRIKES- pTHEY DON'T GO AND SAY IS A PUBLIC IS A PRIVATE IS IT WHATEVER ELSE AND- AND I THINK YEAH I APPRECIATE YOU SHARING YOUR STORIES. ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN NORTHRIDGE WE ALSO HEARD FROM THE OTHER HOSPITALS THE MAN'S PEOPLE COME TO THE HOSPITAL RIGHT THEY MAY COME TO THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE THEY ARE INJURED OR SOMEONE- FAMILIES INJURED BUT THEY MAY BE COMING THE HOSPITAL JUST FOR NEWS WHAT'S GOING ON. RIGHT IT'S- IT'S A IT'S CONVENIENT PLACE FOR PEOPLE AS WELL AND IT'S NOT JUST FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY BE RESIGNING NEIGHBORHOOD IT'S US. ALSO THAT FOR THE FOR SPONSORS COME RAZOR PEOPLE TO ADDRESS HELP I THINK THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE FOR THE HOSPITAL TO BE ABLE TO ACT IN THAT FUNCTION WE CAN HAVE A DEBATE WHETHER YOU KNOW HOW. THE HOSPITAL SHOULD BE THE CENTER FOR THAT- EVER IS IT'S A CITY HALL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT I THINK WITH THIS WAY. RIGHT NOW. PERMIT ME GOOD. THE ROLE THAT OUR HOSPITALS DO PLAY. AND SHOULD PLAY A THIS ASK. GIVE THE- THIS TYPE TO SERVE THERE. AND SO WITH THAT I THINK THERE IS AN ARGUMENT TO BE MADE THAT- SOME OF PARTICULAR HOSPITALS OR STRUGGLING THAT THERE MAY BE SOME NEED FOR PUBLIC SUPPORT BECAUSE AFTER ALL THEY'RE SERVING A FUNCTION. THAT GOES BEYOND SIMPLY. A ORG EMAIL AN INSTITUTION THAT'S PROVIDING HEALTH CARE RIGHT- DURING AN EMERGENCY AND- SO THERE'S THAT SORT OF PUBLIC SPHERE OF. OF THAT. SAME TIME. I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE AS I WAS LISTENING CAREFULLY TO OUR- FROM OUR PERSON FROM OSHKOSH IT IS THAT. I THINK WELL WE MIGHT THINK ABOUT VARIOUS PUBLIC FINANCING OPPORTUNITIES WHETHER IT'S BONDS ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS TO HELP HOSPITALS THAT STRUGGLING. I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT- THE ANY SORT OF PUBLIC FUNDS THAT WE USE LET THOR COULD BE ARGUED IT CIVILLY TO ORDER. SERVICE FUNCTION ERIC TO MEET THE. THIRTY GOT THE IDEA OF HAVING A BILL TO. BUILD SOME LITTLE EXTRA ARE SOME NICER PERSON LIKE THAT. THAT'S BUT- LET I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO KEEP IN MY THAT LEAST WE'RE LEVERAGE. PUBLIC RESOURCES THE THEY CAN ARE THAT WITH THEIR OWN FRIED FINANCE BUT WE NEED TO THE I THINK IN TERMS OF- TRYING TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH OF THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED FORTY THREE BILLION IS REALLY DIRECTLY RELATED TO. THE TWENTY THIRTY STANDARDS VERSES- OTHER THINGS AND I RECOGNIZE WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING SOMETHING NEW RIGHT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT. UBM MAKES SENSE IT'S CHEAPER TO ADD ON TO THAT- BUT I THINK WE NEED TO. THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO- FIGURE OUT AS WELL AND THEN. THEN WHEN IT COMES TO- SO EXACTLY HOW MUCH THAT WOULD BE YOU KNOW WHAT ROLE THAT A PUBLIC FINANCING. WOULD WOULD BE INVOLVED I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE MGHT WANNA LOOK AT AGAIN IS THAT THERE'S HOSPITAL'S EARNED DIFFERENT RANGES RIGHT SO WE HAVE SOME THAT ARE DOING BETTER THAN OTHERS BUT I THINK PARTICULAR SAFETY NET. HOSPITALS THE OTHER PART THAT I ALSO MIGHT WANT TO MENTION IS THAT WE TALK ABOUT FINANCING AND HOW THE HOSPITAL PAYS BACK ANY SORT OF LOAN. THAT THEY MAY HAVE- OUR SAFETY NET HOSPITALS ARE OFTEN MORE DEPENDENT ON. STATE XIN REIMBURSEMENT FUNDING HAS THEIR FUNDING STREAM LIKE MEDI CAL. SO WE MIGHT WANT TO HAVE TO LOOK AT. WHAT'S MEDI CAL'S ROLE- AND WE DO GET A FEDERAL MATCH FOR SOME OF THE MEDICAL SPENDING. NOW IS THERE IN TERMS OF FROM ENSURING THAT WE PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE FINANCING STREAM. FROM THE PATIENT CARE RECOGNIZES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF PATIENT CARE I MEAN WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS TRYING TO PROTECT. THE PATIENTS FIRST AND THEN THE STAFF FOR TAKING CARE OF THEM. DURING A DISASTER AND THAT STAFF IS ALSO NEEDED SO WE WILL KEEP THOSE PATIENTS SAFE AND THAT'S THAT'S ALSO NEED TAKE CARE OF OTHER PATIENTS MAY BE COMING AND SO WE- NEED HOSPITAL. GETTING CAN TAKE PEOPLE GETTING INJURED WITHIN THE HOSPITAL- AND- OR NOT BE ABLE TO DELIVER THE HELP THEY NEED BECAUSE OF SLOW. IN IT UNABLE TO. RIGHT SO I THINK THAT PART OF THE GOAL OF THE TWENTY THIRTY STANDARDS SO THAT. WE ACTUALLY CAN MAKE USE OF ALL THE PROFESSIONAL. SO THAT'S AVAIL. ON SITE BE ABLE TO CONTINUE DELIVER SERVICES. SO IN MY MIND AT LEAST SOME. I DON'T I DON'T THINK WE WANT THE CONVERSATION SHOULD BE ABOUT. GIVE UP ON THE THIRTY STANDARD I THINK THE- BEES. THAT THERE. AND CAN WE- TO HELP. PLEASE AND THE P. WORKED WELL TO GET TO THAT. ARE USING YOU KNOW PRUDENTLY. FOR SOME A PUBLIC TO TRY TO HELP THEM IS TO YOU NEED SYSTEM I THINK MANY OF THE HOSPITALS AND PARTICULARLY RURAL COMMUNITIES OR BEGAN OFTENTIMES DEPENDENT ON PUBLIC FOR. REIMBURSEMENTS ANYWAY IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. OF THE WORD TIME ON DIFFERENT SIDES YEAH AS AS AS ITS STATE AND ALSO WHAT COUNTIES AND THEY'LL PLAYING MULTIPLE ROLES IN TERMS OF- HOW THAT HOW THAT WORKS- SO- SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF. YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS A CONVERSATION WE NEED TO CONTINUE BUT- I DO WE WANT TO CAUTION AND THAT- WE WE'VE DECIDED AS A LEGISLATURE WE ESTABLISH THESE I MEAN THIS IS EXISTING LAW TWENTY THIRTY STANDARDS AND I ALSO APPRECIATE. HEARING FROM. I WAS COMMON FROM AJ BUT THAT WE WANT YOU KNOW WE WANNA TRY TO. BIG SURE THAT WERE FOCUSING ON- YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL RISK IS RIGHT WHEN NOT USING A ONE SIZE FITS ALL BUT- ULTIMATELY FOR THAT COMMUNITY WE NEED TO BE SURE TO HOSPITALS ABLE TO FUNCTION. THE OTHER THING I ALSO PERHAPS THEY CAN ALSO SAY AND- AND PERHAPS MAYBE COMING ON AND I KNOW YOU MADE SOME REMARKS IS THAT. HOW DO WE AS FOR HOSPITALS ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO TO TRY TO MINIMIZE THE COST OF THEM GETTING THERE SO- LITTLE YOU KNOW. TO ASK FIGHT A LITTLE BIT LIKE CAN WE YOU KNOW WHAT. I MEAN I WAS INVOLVED IN SOME HOSPITAL AYE AYE WITH WASN'T DIRECTLY INVOLVED BY WITNESS SOME HOSPITAL CONSTRUCTION WHEN I WAS AT UC DAVIS AND SO WE WANT TO BE SURE WE MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST SAFETY STANDARDS- BUT- CAN WE'D- LIKE. FACILITATE THAT NOW I'M NOT TAKING S CISIONS AND THINGS THAT OFTEN CAN CAUSE DELAYS THAT AND INCREASED COSTS- SPECIALLY- IF. COME OUT YEAH. AT LEAST ONE OF THE PRICE OF THE METALS GATHERS YOU KNOW THE VARIOUS PARTS WAS GOING UP DAY BY DAY AND YOU'RE SITTING THERE WAITING FOR DECISION AND NOW IT'S TWO MONTHS LATER NOW. IT'S GOT A BIT MORE EXPENSIVE TO BUILD IT THAN IT WAS BEFORE HIM FOR THE SAME DESIGN- MAYBE WE CAN TRY TO DO SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES AS WELL TO TRY TO HELP REDUCE. THE COST WHAT TRAIN CHIEF THE GOALS SO- I KNOW IT KIND OF GAVE MORE OF A SPEECH THAT QUESTION BUT- I AM CAN YOU MAYBE- PERHAPS- OUR WITNESSES CAN. REFLECT IS THAT APPROACH THAT YOU THINK THAT- FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THAT WE CAN WE CAN ACHIEVE. AND YOUR ORGANIZATIONS SUPPORT FOR THAT. THEN THE IS IN THE- REBUILDING. THE HOSPITAL. CAN DOWN AND THEY PUT IT OFF THEY PUT IT OFF THEY PUT IT OFF. THEY FINALLY SOLD THE HOSPITAL N TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO PROVIDENCE PROVIDENCE SAID THEY WERE GOING TO REBUILD IT. AND BACK AT THE TIME WE WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE ROUGHLY A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO REBUILD THE HOSPITAL. WELL JUST RECENTLY. PROVIDENCE TOOK IT THEY FINALLY BROKE GROUND THEY PUT ARE DOING THE RETROFIT THEY'RE TEARING DOWN. THE FRONT HALF OF THE HOSPITAL THIS WEEK. AND CEDARS SINAI HAD TO COME IN WITH A OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR BY AND IN O IT SO THAT DELAY IN THAT WHOLE PROCESS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU JUST SAID. THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS EVERYTHING THEN IT WOULD HAVE COST TO REPAIR IT BACK AT THAT TIME. WAS HAS TRIPLED. AND YET FOR ALL THAT PERIOD OF TIME WE'VE BEEN SITTING WITH THE HOSPITAL THE DOESN'T DOESN'T COMPLY WE HAVE AREAS IN THE HOSPITAL THAT I CAN SHOW YOU WHERE THE STAIRCASE WAS TWISTED. DURING THE INITIAL EARTHQUAKE BUT IT'S STILL THERE IS ONE CHANGE. IT SO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IT IS DONE IN A TIMELY MANNER TO PROTECT OUR PATIENTS. YEAH I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS YOU KNOW YEAH YOU DELAY PROJECTS IT'S GOING TO COST MORE LATER WE'VE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR YEARS AS WE HAVE THESE DEBATES- IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T HIM. MAKE THINGS CHEAPER AND THEN YOU GET TO A CERTAIN POINT WHERE YOU JUST DO JUST A FOR JUST A FULL NEW HOSPITAL BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY CHEAPER THAT WAY THEN TO- RETROFIT THE PART- AND I THINK ALSO AND IN SOME OF MY COMMENTS I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW. IN INSTANCES WHERE THERE'S A HAND OFF FOR SALE FROM HOSPITAL TO HOSPITAL I THINK IT KIND OF WHO WAS TO LOOK AT THOSE TRANSACTIONS TO WE'VE BEEN TALKING INTERNALLY IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO WITH. DEPARTMENT OF- MY DD PH KINDA STREAMLINED LICENSING WHERE- THE PREVIOUS BUYER IS BUYING THE HOSPITAL THAT HAS RETROFIT ISSUES CAN QUICKLY DO THIS THEY CALL ONE HAND OFF. AT DOT COM THIS WOMAN LATE THE HOSPITAL. DOES LITTLE NEW ONES THINGS ARE. IN OF OFF BOOK IF YOU WILL ISSUES WERE FINE. OUR PROBLEM THAT ALSO LEAD TO DELAYS SO THINGS OF THAT NATURE WITH. SOME THAT WILL BE HELPFUL TO US. THERE IS ANOTHER THING THAT CAME TO MIND BUT- THOSE TYPES OF THINGS WOULD BE IT WOULD BE INTERESTING I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANOTHER HOOK- I KNOW THAT WE- KIND OF WALK CAREFULLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EXPANDING ANY OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S KIND OF POWERS AROUND THE STUFF- BUT ALSO. TO YOUR POINT ABOUT YOU KNOW THESE DIFFERENT TRANSACTIONS YOU KNOW THE PREVIOUS THE THAT WOULD BE PERSPECTIVE BUYER HAS TO PONY UP A LOT OF CASH TO STAY YES DO. YOU KNOW EACH WITH A HOT WEATHER SEISMIC OBLIGATIONS PENSION OBLIGATIONS ALL THAT SOME OF THAT STUFF FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS AND HOW. DOES THAT- YOU KNOW KIND OF FLOW A LITTLE BIT MORE SMOOTHLY WITH THESE THESE LEAST DIFFERENT TRANSACTIONS WE'RE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT WAYS WE CAN PROVIDE. ON HIS. YOU MIGHT BY ONE DAY AND THEN. THE NEXT THING FALLS APART AND THEN YOU HAVE THAT HOSPITAL THAT NOT ONLY NEEDS TO BE ACQUIRED BUT HAS SAID SO SIZE RETROFIT ON THE BOOKS HAS TO BE MET SO HOW COULD WE WORK WITHIN THAT FRAMEWORK TO MAKE THINGS MORE STREAMLINED TO WE'VE BEEN JUST WRESTLING WITH THOSE GUYS IDEAS SO THIS TRANSACTION ISSUES YEAH. YEAH I'LL JUST SAY THAT WE WOULD UPS PARTICIPATE IN LOOKING AT WHATEVER SOLUTIONS AND SECOND- COME OUT OF WORKING TOGETHER WITH OF COURSE LABOR AND BUSINESS AT THE TABLE TO YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT THE SITUATION YEARS MENTION WHICH IS COMPLIANCE BUT ALSO EASING HOW THEY GET THERE SO WE HAVE OUR COMMITMENT THAT WE WOULD BE AT THAT TABLE TO TRY TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION. THANK YOU. RIGHT NOW ANY OTHER QUESTIONS- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS. IT THE END OF. OKAY SO I'M GONNA SO NOW I THINK- WE'RE MOVING ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT SO LEAVE THE TURN IT GAVEL THAT YOU'RE WITH YEAH THANK YOU SO WE'D LIKE A PUBLIC COMMENT IF YOU CAN KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO A MINUTE THAT WOULD BE GREAT I KNOW THAT'S NOT WE WON'T I'M NOT GONNA BE HARD ON YOU. BUT BUT IF PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME. HELLO MY NAME IS THE OVERSEAS. WE ALWAYS ALREADY FOR AND PEOPLE NORTH CALIFORNIA WORK AT NORTHRIDGE HIGH. OF I WAS THERE FOR THE NINETY FOUR EARTHQUAKE I SAW WHEN I WALK WHEN I DROVE INTO THE HOSPITAL THE G. TOWER BY THIS PARKING STRUCTURE WHERE I PARK AT THE WHOLE FACADE WAS GONE THE ONLY THING THAT SEPARATED THE PATIENTS IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD WAS THE SHEET ROCK. THOSE PATIENTS WERE MOVED OUT OF THAT BUILDING THE OPERATING ROOM WHERE I WORK WAS OUT OF SERVICE BECAUSE A WATER BREAK IN THE OPERATING ROOM WE MOVE SUPPLIES DOWN TO OUR AMBULATORY SURGERY CENTER IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS. BUT BECAUSE- OF THE- OF DAMAGE THAT WAS DONE TO THE HOSPITAL INTO THE OPERATING ROOM WE COULDN'T DO IT UNTIL LIKE THE NEXT DAY BUT WE WERE ALL READY TO DO IT TO TAKE CARE FOR PATIENTS THAT WERE COMING IN. AND TRUST ME THE PATIENTS WERE COMING IN AND DROPS ARE NICK YOU BABIES OUT- NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE PATIENTS THEY WERE TAKEN DOWN FIVE FLIGHTS OF STAIRS TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. AND THEY WERE ALL SHELTERED ON THE FLOOR ON BLANKETS UNDER SHELVES IN OUR EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE THE DAY ARE THEY ABLE CENTER WAS DAMAGED. THE HOSPITAL. HAD OUR HOSPITAL NOT BEEN RETRO FOR IT PRIOR TO THAT EARTHQUAKE. THAT HOSPITAL WOULD NOT BE STANDING TODAY. SO I URGE YOU TO PLEASE DO NOT GIVE UP ON THE STANDARDS THE SEISMIC STANDARDS FOR THE EARTHQUAKE BECAUSE IT DOES SAY BUILDINGS BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT SAVES LIVES PATIENTS EMPLOYEES THAT ARE THERE TO CARE FOR THOSE PATIENTS SO PLEASE I URGE YOU. TO WHATEVER WHAT EVER IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO WORK BUT THE HOSPITALS THAT NEED THE FUNDS. WORK WITH THEM. BUT WE DO NAY SEISMIC RETROFITTING OUR REPLACEMENT OF HOSPITALS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE. IT'S A LITTLE BRING IT BACK- WHICH I TO CLOSE SO. I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE WITNESSES WHO CAME 2% TODAY AND I REALLY APPRECIATED- THE VERY IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVES AND INFORMATION YOU'VE SHARED WITH- ARE- JOINT- ASSEMBLY HEALTH THE- COMMITTEES- AND- I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES FOR US TO- TO WORK ON. IN RELATION TO THIS ISSUE OF SEISMIC SAFETY BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY THIS IS ABOUT HOW O WE KEEP OUR PATIENTS SAFE HOW DO WE KEEP THE STAFF WHO WORK IN THE HOSPITAL SAFE. AND HOW DO WE KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE ESPECIALLY IN THE DISASTER- TO SURE THAT THERE IS- THERE AT THAT THE FACILITIES THERE IN THE COMMUNITY OR ABLE TO CONTINUE TO SERVE THE COMMUNITIES- AND DURING THAT AS ASTOR AND I WILL- I. CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT BY THE WAY JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE A DISASTER DOESN'T MEAN ALL THE NORMAL THINGS IN LIFE. IMMEDIATELY STOP EITHER PEOPLE STILL DELIVER BABIES DAHLE STUFF HEART ATTACKS AND STROKES IN ADDITION TO ALL ANY INJURIES OR OTHER EVENTS THAT HAPPENS RESULT DISASTER SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT- WE HAVE OUR- HOSPITALS BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO FUNCTION. THE SAME TIME I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT- IN DOING SO THE HOSPITAL IS A SERVING A BROADER COMMUNITY FONG AND- AND THAT- PERHAPS WILL BE AS STATE NEED TO THINK OF SOME DIFFERENT OP. WE CAN'T PARTICULARLY SUPPORT- SAFETY NET HOSPITALS HOSPITALS THAT- ARE STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY TO BE SURE THEY CAN BE THESE VERY IMPORTANT STANDARD. I GUESS I THINK EVERYONE ARE PRESENTED AND THIS IS UP IN A VERY POOR HEARING TO HEAR FROM ALL OF YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR PAN FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE AND- ANY PARTICIPATION IN. AND YOUR FIRST AS A PROVIDER WHICH I THINK IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT- APPRECIATE THANK YOU EVERYBODY WHO CAME IN PRESENTED TODAY THIS IS A COMPLEX PROBLEM- AND- WE- THIS THE OVER-HERE THIS IS A HEARING TO. TO LOOK AT- THE COMPLEXITY OF THE THIS IS NOT ABOUT A SPECIFIC BILL THIS POINT ALTHOUGH THERE IS A BILL OUT THERE IS PENDING IN. AND I THINK SOME OF THE COMMENTS HERE MAY HAVE SOME INFLUENCE OVER OVER HOW THAT HOW THAT ULTIMATELY PLAYS OUT. FOR ME- AND I AND I DON'T MEAN TO BEAT A DEAD HORSE COULD- WHICH IS STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE. BUT YOU KNOW I THINK THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN SOME OF OUR OUR MORE RURAL AREAS AREN'T ARE LITTLE DIFFERENT. AND SO THE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH IS REALLY ARE A STRUGGLE FOR ME- SOMEONE HOSPITALS ARE STRUGGLING- THEY'RE NOT LIKELY TO BE ACQUIRED. MORE LIKELY TO CALL THOSE. THEN IS THAT WOULD MEAN FOR COMMUTE WHAT IS IT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE. WAS THAT MEAN FOR THE PEOPLE WHO- GO THERE. WE KNOW THAT. IN OTHER AREAS OF THE- WHERE HA. CLOSE IT LIVE. IN CASES THE OF THE UNIT. THE DOES. WELL WITH THAT IN THE LONG RUN SO. GOAL WE WANT TO SAY FOSTER. THE CAN WE- THESE. OF AT THE DAY WE ALL WILL. IT'LL. WE. WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME FOR.
