VERY GOOD THANK YOU SIR. MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER TURNOVERS MODICUM ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY ALAMEDA AND SUPPORT THANK YOU OKAY THANKS SO MUCH. LET'S SEE NO OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF ANY IN OPPOSITION. WELCOME MR MCCAIN I THINK MAYBE WE DON'T MIND FREEING UP THANK YOU SENATOR. YES. OKAY GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WELL CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TERRY MCHALE WITH ERIN READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING A COALITION OF OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION IS. I'M GOING TO TAKE THE ADVICE OF BILL CRAVEN WHO TOLD ME TO DO THREE THINGS THIS MORNING. HE SAID FIRST OF ALL SAY SOMETHING NICE ABOUT SENATOR GLAZER. I CAN TELL YOU THAT'S A VERY EASY THING TO DO HE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY RESILIENT THIS IS THE THIRD TIME. THAT WE HAVE SEEN THIS BILL. HE IS AN OUTSTANDING THE INDIA HAS TO FIX LOOKING BETTER AND BETTER. SECOND OF ALL BILL SAID BRIEFLY EXPLAIN WHY YOU ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. SENATOR GLAZERS AN EXCELLENT LEGISLATOR. THIS IS A BAD BILL IN THIS IS A BAD BILL FOR TWO REASONS FIRST OF ALL THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE HEARD IT AND THE REASON IT HASN'T PASSED BEFORE IS NOT BECAUSE THERE'S A REAT AFFINITY FOR V I RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S ALWAYS LIKE REPRESENTING THE RED HEADED STEP CHILD. BUT THEY DO A GREAT JOB AND WE'VE RUN LEGISLATION ONLY EIGHT OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PARKS ARE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION PARKS. THE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS SAYS THAT WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE WAY TO BE. IS A NATIONAL EXAMPLE OF HOW TO DO IT RIGHT. WE HAVE MORE SCIENTIST WORKING ON A WAY TO BE THAN ANY OTHER PART OF THE PARKS. WE HAVE MITIGATION PROCESS I SAW THAT THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN STAFF ALSO WANT TO SAY THIS ONLY WHEN STAFFERS BEEN GREAT TO DEAL WITH AND I APPRECIATE THEIR COURTESIES. THERE'S PICTURES IN WHICH WE SHOW THE DAMAGE THAT EIGHT FEET DOES. THE TRUTH IS THERE'S TWO TRUTH TO THAT ONE IS THAT THOSE PATHWAYS SHOW THAT YOU CAN RECREATE SAFELY. AND SECOND OF ALL THERE WAS LEGISLATION LAST YEAR THAT SAYS WHEN WE DO THAT KIND OF DAMAGE WE MITIGATE. SO WE TAKE CARE OF IT LATER R. O. H. B. PARKS ARE THE CLEANEST EXAMPLE OF HOW H. B. RECREATION SHOULD BE DONE. THE SECOND REASON WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. IS THAT IT SETS A VERY DANGEROUS PRECEDENT. PARKS DID EVERYTHING THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PARK COULD BE USED FOR OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION. MANY OF THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE BILL WHO ARE SUPPORT THIS BILL IN A PROPOSAL A TV AT THE TIME. THAT IT WAS SET ASIDE FOR A WAY TO BE RECREATION TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GOT RIGHT OF WAYS FOR THEIR OWN PROPERTY. THEY MADE SURE THAT THE VERY WOULD TAKEN CARE OF AND NOW THEY OPPOSE THE IDEA OF HAVING IT IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. IF YOU ALLOW THIS BILL TO GO THROUGH EVERY SINGLE TIME STATE PARKS SETS ASIDE A PARK FOR A PARTICULAR REASON. AN EXCELLENT LEGISLATOR CAN STEP FORWARD AND SAY WE DON'T WANT TO DO IT IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD WE WANT TO REVISIT THE PROCESS WE WANT INEXPENSIVE X. EXHAUSTIVE RE VISIT. OF AN ISSUE IT'S A BAD IDEA IT'S A BAD PRECEDENT WHICH HE HAS DONE EVERYTHING THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO IT'S AN AREA THAT THAT WORKS FOR H. B. RECREATION IN AGAIN ONLY EIGHT OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PARKS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME YOU SEE AND WHAT. CITY WHAT WAS THE THIRD THING CRAVEN TOLD YOU DO BECAUSE A BRIEF FOR OUR EXPLORATION LASER AND THEN YOU LET THIRD ALL THE THIRD THING WAS TO ASK THAT YOU NOT VOTE FOR THIS. HE HE DIDN'T SAY. IT WAS IN HIS. THIRTIES HAD TO DO A CLOSE UNDERSTOOD VERY GOOD THERE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. OKAY MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE JAMES EMBARRASSING ON BEHALF OF THE BETA CALIFORNIA MOTORCYCLE USERS. AND THE CALIFORNIA MOTOR DO MOTORCYCLE DEALERS ASSOCIATION. THAT SELL AND SERVICE THE MOTORCYCLES AND THE EQUIPMENT TO BE USED. AND TERREUS ELOQUENTLY OUTLINED OUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK WE'RE GONNA STEPS QUORUM NOW THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR BEING HERE SO JUST TAKE PAUSE FOR A BRIEF MOMENT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE CENTERS TURN HERE. JONES JUST PRESENT ALLEN FORGES CABALLERO COMING OVER HERE HERTZBERG HUESO. HUESO HERE JACKSON MONEY MONEY HERE. VERY GOOD WE HAVE A QUORUM MEMBERS QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SEEING NONE A YES SEE ONE. WELL I WILL I WILL MAKE THE COMMENT BECAUSE I. THE CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATION THE LAST TIME IN AND I'LL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AT THIS THIS BILL DID CAUSE ME SOME PAUSE FOR EXACTLY THE REASON THAT WITH ARTICULATED BY THE OPPOSITION YEAH AND I AM STRUCK BY THE. I'M STRUCK BY THE COMMENT THAT. YOU KNOW WE SUPPORT HD BUT NOT HERE IT'S A LITTLE BIT SIMILAR TO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE LIKE TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE SUPPORTED BUT NOT HERE AND THEN IT BECOMES NOT REALLY ANYWHERE. A SO MY CONCERN IS THAT IT MAY MAKE IT IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE FOR US TO FIGURE OUT. HOW DO WE CREATE RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE WRITERS OF H. B. VEHICLES H. VEHICLES ALL OVER THE STATE SO THAT IF WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE WE'RE NOT ASKING THEM TO DRIVE SIX HOURS TO GO SOME PLACE. TO BE ABLE TO RECREATION FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS AND THEN THEY HAVE TO DRIVE SIX HOURS BACK AND I SAID I'M I'M I I'M NOT AND I KNOW EACH BE ENTHUSIAST. WHO'S GOT TIME BUT- BUT BUT I DO HAVE STAFF HI CHAU IT'S LIKE. HIS WOULD BE GREAT TAKE ME OUT. ESPECIALLY ON A DAY LIKE TODAY. BUT BUT I KNOW PEOPLE THAT THAT THAT ARE AND WHAT THEY TELL ME IS THAT THEY REALLY HAVE TO TRAVEL A LONG DISTANCE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO. TO ENJOY THE SPORT AND TO ME AND IT'S A IT'S A FAMILY RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITY AND YOU CAN TAKE YOUR KIDS THAT ARE AT AT A VERY YOUNG AGE. AND SPEND TIME TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT'S WE WANT THAT AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS IS A- I'D A DISTRICT BELL AND I RESPECT THAT AND I AM. I'M I'M I'M AN EXPERT ABOUT TODAY BUT I AM A LITTLE BIT TROUBLED BY THE DANGEROUS PRECEDENT THAT WE ARE SITTING WHICH IS TO PICK AND CHOOSE AND DECIDE. YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE GOING TO OVER RULE THAT WISE WE GIVE THAT THE AUTHORITY DID THAT TO OUR DEPARTMENTS AND AT SOME POINT WE NEED TO. THEN LISTEN TO THEM SO. THOUGHT FOR A- UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH A- STRUCTURE. LARA I JUST I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT SENATOR COVER YOUR JUST RUINED MY DAY. I THOUGHT I WAS IN H. B. ENTHUSIAST AND THEN I JUST REALIZED I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO DO IT. SO MAYBE I'M NOT ANYMORE AND MAYBE NEED TO RECONSIDER THAT BUT I HAVE NOW THAT SHE HAS SAID THAT WHEN I GET HOME. I'VE GOT SEVERAL EACH BE PARKS IN MY AREA THAT I WILL I GET TO NOW. BUT THERE DO YOU WANT TO SHARE SOME. SERIOUS CONCERNS FOR THE TRADITIONS OF THE SENATE AND THIS BILL IN PARTICULAR YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL THE TRADITIONS IN PRACTICE OF THE LEGISLATURE AT LEAST THE SENATE USED TO BE THE BILL'S TELLING COMMITTEE OF THE OTHER HOUSE WOULD NOT ALL OF A SUDDEN BE PUT INTO A LAKE GOTTEN AMEND. AND YOU KNOW HERE WE ARE IN THE LAST THREE DAYS OF SESSION AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE WE'RE WE WANT TO VIOLATE THAT TRADITION SB SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN WHICH IT WAS AND I DIFFICULT IS MAJOR WAS HELD IN THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND I WOULD ARGUE APPROPRIATELY. THAT SHOULD BE THE END OF IT WE SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE LISTENING TO THIS A LAST MINUTE GOTTEN AMEND. WE EITHER HAVE TRADITIONS AND IN THE SENATE THAT WE'RE GONNA LIVE BY RULES AND PRACTICES. OR I'VE AFRAID TO THAT THE SENATE IS GIVING UP A PORTION OF ITS INTEGRITY. BY HAVING THIS COME UP AT SUCH A LATE TIME. SECONDLY AND MORE TO THE POINT OF THE BILL OF THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS HAS HAS BEEN SHARED ALREADY THIS MORNING ARE EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC. THE AREA ENCOMPASSED BY THIS BILL WAS PURCHASED WITH OAG FUNDS AND IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE USED FOR HV PURPOSES. THE STATE WILL BE GOING OUT BACK ON ITS COMMITMENT ONCE AGAIN AND I'M AFRAID THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL BE SET AND I JUST DID NOT SET THAT PRESIDENT THAT THIS LAND WAS APPROPRIATELY PURCHASED PROPERLY PLANNED. AND I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER POINTS I'D LIKE TO DRIVE. A LITTLE BIT EVEN MOREAS THE MITIGATION ON THESE TYPES OF PARKS. WELL I'VE BEEN IN A LOT OF THEM AND I AGREE WITH THAT MR MCHALE THAT. THE R. O. H. V. PARKS IN CALIFORNIA ARE PRISTINE AND- WHAT THAT WOULD WITH THESE ALWAYS FREE PARKS I THINK SOMETIMES YOU LOSE THE FOCUS ON THAT ON. WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE WITH THE WHICH HE PARKS. IS IT WE PLAN THEM WE PUT THEM IN A PARTICULAR PART OF THE STATE. THEY PROVIDE A RECREATION AVENUE FOR FOLKS OUR STATE IN IS CENTER COPIER POINTED OUT WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE DRIVING SIX HOURS. TO GET TO THESE RECREATION AREAS. ARE AND WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU WHEN YOU BUILD AND- ANNOYS ME PARK LIKE THIS THAT'S MANAGED PROPERLY THIS PLAN THE PEOPLE GOING USE IT. AND THEN IT TAKES THE PRESSURE OFF. OTHER PROPERTY OTHER LAND THAT IS NOW ABLE TO MAINTAIN ITS MOST PRISTINE. AB SITUATION BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ILLEGALLY OFF ROADING NOW I'M NOT MAKING AN EXCUSE FOR PEOPLE TO GO ILLEGALLY OFFROAD I I'VE I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT SUPPORT THAT. BUT WHEN WE WHEN WE GIVE THEM. PROPERLY MANAGED IN PLAN AREAS TO GO TO IT DECREASES THE AMOUNT OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY IN THOSE AREAS AND. AND WHAT NINETY NINE POINT 9% OF OFF ROADERS WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND GO TO THE RIGHT PLACES AND IN JOY THEIR STATE AND SO I AM HOPEFUL THAT THE THIS COMMITTEE WILL TURN THIS BILL DOWN AND THAT WILL GET THIS ALWAYS THREE PARK PROPERLY BUILT. AND USED FOR PEOPLE DIRECTORY IN THAT AREA THE STATE THANKS VERY MUCH OKAY THANK YOU MISS RICE FOR OTHERS YES THERE WAS A JUST GENERALLY AND THIS BILL DOESN'T HAVE A PROVISION THAT REQUIRES. IF THIS LAND IS SOLD THAT'D BE REPLACED WITH ANOTHER RECREATION AREA. I IMAGINE IF THIS IS SOLD FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES IF THEY- HAVE FOUND THAT THERE IS ENORMOUS BAR BERMAN VALLEY IN THIS LAND AND IT IS SOLD. IS THERE A REQUIREMENT THAT THIS ASSET BE REPLACED IN TERMS OF ANOTHER RECREATIONAL AREA. BECAUSE I DON'T SEE THAT IN IN IN THE ANALYSIS SAID THE BILL DOESN'T REQUIRE. ANYTHING OF THE STATE PARKS IS PURELY GIVES STATE PARKS THE RIGHT TO SELL THE LAND FOR AT LEAST AS MUCH AS IT WAS PURCHASED FOR. SO TO GET THEIR MONEY BACK I UNDERSTAND THAT MONEY GOES BACK TO BE OFFERED VEHICLE PORTION TO USE AS THEY WELL WE'RE NOT MANDATING HOW STATE PARKS WILL DO THAT BUT- I IMAGINE THEY WOULD USE IT TO CREATE OFFERED VEHICLE OPPORTUNITIES BUT I WANT TO. ALSO SAY THAT YOU KNOW SENATOR GLAZER AND HIS DRAFTING OF THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS BILL WAS THOUGHTFUL IN MAKING SURE THAT WE DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR OFFERED FOR LEGAL OFFERED VEHICLE NEXT DOOR. I MEAN CONTINUOUS WITH THIS LAND THERE IS LEGAL OPPORTUNE DE THE NOBODY IS TOUCHING. AND WE CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. AND IT IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MAP OF THE DIABLO RANGE. WHICH COMES OFF MOUNT DIABLO IN DOWN THE STATE THIS IS A PINCH POINT FOR THE ANIMALS THAT ARE MIGRATING. AND WHEN WE TURN THIS INTO AN OFFERED VEHICLE PARK WE WILL CLOSE THAT MIGRATION PATTERNS. AND CURRENTLY THIS PIECE OF THE LAND IS USED BY THOSE ANIMALS. AND AGAIN THERE'S IN NEIGHBORING PIECE OF LAND THEY ARE LEGALLY ALLOWED TO AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE ALLOWED TO. RECORD ON THEY WON'T HAVE TO DRIVE ANY FURTHER THAN THEY CURRENTLY DRIVE. BUT YOU KNOW THIS PIECE OF LAND LIKE YOU SAID HAS INCREDIBLE. IMPORTANCE TO THE BIODIVERSITY OF THE DIABLO RANGE AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE THIS PIECE BUT OF COURSE THEY HAVE THE MONEY THEY WILL HAVE THE MONEY RETURNED TO THEM. TO CREATE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. YOU KNOW I WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE SUPPORT. THE BILL SHOULD THERE BE SOME. I'M PLACE. AND WORK ON TERMS OF A REQUIREMENT OF. THE IN EITHER A NEARBY ORIGINATION AREAS THIS P. REPLACES PART OF KIND OF THE- MAIN ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION IS VERY IMPORTANT AND IF THIS IS BEEN FOUND TO HAVE ENORMOUS ENVIRONMENTAL VALUE I THINK THAT SHOULD. DOT THAT SHOULD TAKE PRECEDENCE HOWEVER. IN REGARDS TO THESE RECREATION AREAS I'VE ALWAYS NOTED THAT HAVE BEEN. AN AREA WHERE PEOPLE WOULD RECREATION WILL WOULD ENSURE THAT PEOPLE DON'T. OF. I DON'T INTEND TO DON'T TRY TO RECREATION AREAS THAT ARE SENSITIVE HABITAT WHERE THEY SHOULDN'T BE RECREATION AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN A PROBLEM IN MY DISTRICT BECAUSE I HAVE A VERY LARGE DISTRICT THAT OCCURRED AT THAT INCLUDES SOME SOME VERY IMPORTANT BARMAN HABITAT THAT AFFECTS CERTAIN SPECIES THAT ARE OF THREATENED AND- ENDANGERED. AND PEOPLE JUST GO OUT THERE RECREATION BECAUSE THEY DON'T THEY HAVE VERY VERY LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES AND SOME VERY LARGE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. WHERE YOU CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY AND MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO GO OUT INTO THE OPEN SPACE AND ENVIRONMENT AND CAUSE HARM. AND SO ANY CHANCE THAT WE CAN DO THAT THAT. HAS ENVIRONMENTAL VALUE AND IF IT'S WORKED INTO A PLAN. THAT COULD WE COULD ENSURE THAT. ONCE YOU SELL THIS LANNISTER TO TRY TO DEVELOP ANOTHER THE SAME PEOPLE THAT. HELP YOU ACQUIRE IS LOUDER THAN OPPOSE THAT MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE STATE TO REPLACE THE SASSER UNLESS IT'S UNLESS IT'S PART. OF AN AGREEMENT THAT SHOULD THIS LAND BE SOLD THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO PUT THOSE MONIES IN THOSE FUNDS BECAUSE THOSE FUNDS COULD BE RIGHT UP. IN LAWSUITS. OF FOR YEARS AND I'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN WITH. URBAN PROJECTS LIBRARIES AND PARKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT TO GET. HELD UP IN IN LITIGATION FOR YEARS. THROUGH KIND OF THE SEQUEL PROCESS OF SEQUEL WE WANT TO WE WANT USED TO PROTECT LAND BUT IT'S OFTEN SICK WAS OFTEN ABUSED. AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WITH REGARD TO THIS MEASURE THROUGH THE CHAIR CENTER. PLEASE I'M STILL ACTIVATIONS THAT CENTER HUESO ONE IS THAT THE OFF ROAD VEHICLE COMMISSION. MADE OF ENTHUSIASTS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND REC ARE IN CHARGE HERE NOT THAT NOTHING IN THIS BILL CHANGES THAT THEY GET TO DECIDE WHAT'S BEST. FOR THIS PROJECT OR TO LET MAKE A DECISION THAT MAYBE WOULD BE BEST TO SELL THE LAND OKAY SO THEY THEY REMAIN IN CHARGE NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. SECOND THING IS THAT ANY MONEY THAT'S DEPOSITED BACK INTO THE H. B. FIND BY LAW IS RESTRICTED IN ITS USE. UNLESS WE CHANGE THE LAW IT HAS TO BE A PROVIDED FOR THAT ACTIVITY WHEREVER IT'S DE DESIGNATED TO BE USED FOR AS I MENTIONED I WANTED TO BE USED FOR THAT ACTIVITY NOT TRY TIED UP AND LAWSUITS WELL THAT'S OF COURSE THE PROBLEM THAT THEY'RE FACING TODAY. IS THAT THE LAND IS TIED UP IN WHAT. AND THAT THE- DEPARTMENT DOES AN OPTION TODAY IF THEY SAID WE WERE SPENDING MILLIONS ON THE LAWYERS. THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THERE'S ALREADY OFF ROAD% RIGHT THERE. A MINUTE AWAY THAT PEOPLE CAN USE WITH DECLINING. ATTENDANCE SO WE CAN STILL MAINTAIN THAT ACTIVITY RIGHT THERE IN THE AREA FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ENJOYING IT. BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO SPEND MILLIONS IN LAWYER FEES NOW. WHEN WE CAN CUT OUR LOSSES AND FIND ANOTHER PLACE THAT'S MORE AMENABLE FOR THIS ACTIVITY. SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL PROVIDES THAT ONLY THAT OPTION. UP TO DO EXACTLY WHAT I THINK YOU'RE ENCOURAGING Là. OKAY THANK YOU OTHER MEMBERS COMMENTS QUESTIONS SEEING NONE. BY YOU ALL TO CLOSE AYE AYE I WOULD JUST SAY VERY BRIEFLY YEAH THE RESTRICTED USE UNDER CURRENT LAW ON THAT IT WHICH WE TRUST FUND HOPEFULLY WILL SETTLE SOME OF THESE ISSUES I SHARE SOME OF THE ENTHUSIASM OF MY VICE CHAIR ACTUALLY. RAMBLED AROUND ENOUGH TO LOW WELLS AND AT SOME HAIRY EXPERIENCES IN THE SLOT CANYONS ON MY OWN HV ADVENTURES. AND THIS WEEK I KNOCKED HILL WELLS OUT IN. SORRY I'M A GRINGO. LOCAL DEAL WELL OKAY THE SYMPTOMS. AND I THINK LOCAL LOCAL CONTROL AND SORT OF THIS THIS LOCAL INPUT IS CRITICAL SO HEARING FROM YOUR SUPERVISOR AND YOU KNOW SORT OF THE COUNTY AS WELL AS LOCAL MEMBERS IS COMPELLING IN THIS CASE IN TERMS OF DETERMINING WHAT USES OUR BEST IN YOUR BACKYARD AND NOT JUST SAYING NO BUT SAYING WHERE AND SERVER THAT REASONABLY SUPPORT THE MEASURE TODAY AND APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING IT BACK IN ITS TERMS A PROCESS YOU KNOW I CAN ONLY COMMENT ON THE POLICY COMMITTEE HERE IN TERMS OF HOW THE PROCEDURAL RULES COMMITTEE. PROCESS GOES ISN'T IS A LITTLE BIT OF MY PAY GRADE BUT AS A POLICY MATTER I THINK IT'S SOUND AND WELL BAKED AND I APPRECIATE YOUR BRING AFFORD TO ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE. THANK YOU I'M- YES I URGE YOU ALL TO JOIN US OUT IN OUR DISTRICTS TO GO TO CARNEGIE AND ENJOY THE OFFERED VEHICLE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE THERE AND THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THERE FOR THOSE AND AS SENATOR JOHN SAID MOST IF NOT ALL USES LEGALLY AND STAY ON THAT LAND AND SO YOU KNOW WE LIKE TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE LAND NEXT DOOR AT THAT TIME THE ANIMALS SO DESPERATELY NEEDS OUR- I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ISLAND. OKAY VERY GOOD THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION PLEASE CALL TH ROLL. CENTER STERN AYE STERN AYE JONES. JONES NO ALLEN. FORGES HEAVIER. HEAVIER AYE HERTZBERG.
