00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:23.234
GO OUT OF THE RENTAL BUSINESS.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.902
AND THIS WILL HELP PREVENT THE

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:26.404
MORE EGREGIOUS ABUSES THAT

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:28.172
ENCOURAGE LANDLORDS TO EMPTY

00:38:28.239 --> 00:38:30.274
ENTIRE BUILDINGS IN ORDER TO

00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:32.677
EVADE RENT LIMITATIONS.

00:38:32.743 --> 00:38:34.111
THIS WILL ALSO REDUCE THE

00:38:34.178 --> 00:38:36.480
INCENTIVE FOR LANDLORDS -- TO TO

00:38:36.547 --> 00:38:38.282
ALICE A PROPERTY AND THEN LET

00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:39.617
MUCH NEEDED HOUSING UNITS LIE

00:38:39.684 --> 00:38:42.153
FALLOW FOR MORE THAN FIVE YEARS

00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:43.688
SIMPLY SIMPLY SO THAT THEY CAN

00:38:43.754 --> 00:38:45.222
RE RENT THE UNITS AT MARKET

00:38:45.289 --> 00:38:46.123
RATES.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:48.025
IT WILL -- THE BILL WILL CLARIFY

00:38:48.092 --> 00:38:49.760
THAT THE ACT PROHIBITS THE

00:38:49.827 --> 00:38:51.595
RETURN TO THE RENTAL MARKET OF

00:38:51.662 --> 00:38:53.030
LESS THAN ALL THE UNITS IN THE

00:38:53.097 --> 00:38:55.332
SAME WAY THAT THE WITHDRAWAL OF

00:38:55.399 --> 00:38:56.867
LESS THAN ALL THE UNITS IS

00:38:56.934 --> 00:38:57.935
PROHIBITED.

00:38:58.002 --> 00:38:59.837
IN OTHER WORDS ONCE ANY UNIT IS

00:38:59.904 --> 00:39:01.205
RETURNED TO THE RENTAL MARKET

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:02.807
THE ENTIRE PROPERTY IS

00:39:02.873 --> 00:39:04.875
CONSIDERED BACK ON THE RENTAL

00:39:04.942 --> 00:39:06.610
MARKET FOR PURPOSES OF THE ACT.

00:39:06.677 --> 00:39:08.679
FINALLY THE LAW -- WILL MAKE

00:39:08.746 --> 00:39:10.815
EXPLICIT THAT THE PAYMENT OF A

00:39:10.881 --> 00:39:12.550
PENALTY DOES NOT EXTINGUISH THE

00:39:12.616 --> 00:39:14.518
LANDLORDS OBLIGATION TO COMPLY

00:39:14.585 --> 00:39:15.619
WITH THE LAW.

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:17.254
I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE'VE

00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:18.656
REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE

00:39:18.723 --> 00:39:20.324
CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF

00:39:20.391 --> 00:39:22.727
REALTORS ON AMENDMENTS THAT WE

00:39:22.793 --> 00:39:24.128
WILL TAKE IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE.

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:25.529
AND THAT WERE CLOSE TO REACHING

00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:26.897
AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA

00:39:26.964 --> 00:39:29.100
APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WHICH I

00:39:29.166 --> 00:39:30.735
HOPE TO HAVE RESOLVED BY THE

00:39:30.801 --> 00:39:31.802
NEXT HEARING IN A

00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:32.970
PARENTHETICALLY.

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:34.805
I WOULD SAY THAT -- LAST YEAR

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:36.774
WHEN I CARRIED THIS BILL -- WE

00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:38.743
HAD WORKED OUT TO AMENDMENTS

00:39:38.809 --> 00:39:40.144
WITH THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION

00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:42.113
SO I THINK THERE'S A GOOD REASON

00:39:42.179 --> 00:39:43.514
TO BE OPTIMISTIC THAT WE WILL

00:39:43.581 --> 00:39:48.419
HAVE A FULL AGREEMENT WITH --

00:39:48.486 --> 00:39:49.887
BOTH THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION

00:39:49.954 --> 00:39:51.122
AND THE REALTORS -- AS OF THE

00:39:51.188 --> 00:39:52.356
NEXT HEARING -- THIS BILL GETS

00:39:52.423 --> 00:39:53.657
TENANTS SOME SECURITY AND

00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:55.826
KEEPING THEIR HOMES -- IN A TIME

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:57.528
WHEN HOMELESSNESS FOR OUR POOR

00:39:57.595 --> 00:39:59.330
SENIORS DISABLED AND EVEN

00:39:59.396 --> 00:40:01.098
WORKING CLASS IS A REALITY THAT

00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:02.666
IS JUST A PAYCHECK OR RENT

00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:04.368
INCREASE AWAY DUE TO LACK.

00:40:04.435 --> 00:40:06.170
OF READILY AVAILABLE AFFORDABLE

00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:09.473

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.842
YOUR WITNESSES.

00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:12.810
GOOD MORNING OF MY NAME IS

00:40:12.877 --> 00:40:14.712
ALLISON RING A DEPUTY CITY

00:40:14.779 --> 00:40:15.312
ATTORNEY FOR THE CITY OF WEST

00:40:15.379 --> 00:40:17.314
HOLLYWOOD -- UNFORTUNATELY WHAT

00:40:17.381 --> 00:40:19.550
WE'RE SEEING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:40:19.617 --> 00:40:20.818
IS A GROWING BELIEF AMONG

00:40:20.885 --> 00:40:22.720
LANDLORDS THAT THEY CAN EMPTY

00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:25.022
THE BUILDING BY USING ELLIS AND

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:26.891
THEN CHERRY PICK WHICH UNITS TO

00:40:26.957 --> 00:40:28.559
PUT BACK ON THE RENTAL MARKET

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:30.961
WHILE HOLDING BACK.

00:40:31.028 --> 00:40:36.000
OTHERS -- THE INCENTIVE IS.

00:40:36.066 --> 00:40:37.668
TO GET AS MANY TENANTS OUT OF

00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:38.969
THE BUILDING BEFORE SERVING

00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:40.805
ELLIS NOTICES BECAUSE OF THE

00:40:40.871 --> 00:40:42.907
UNIT IS VACANT WHEN THE ELLIS

00:40:42.973 --> 00:40:45.042
NOTICES SERVED THERE ARE NO RENT%

00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:46.944
RESTRICTIONS ON THAT UNIT GOING

00:40:47.011 --> 00:40:48.145
FORWARD.

00:40:48.212 --> 00:40:51.315
SO SOME LANDLORDS ARE USING THAT

00:40:51.382 --> 00:40:54.118
AMBIGUITY IN THE ELLIS ACT TO

00:40:54.185 --> 00:40:55.519
GET RID OF AS MANY TENANTS AS

00:40:55.586 --> 00:40:57.721
POSSIBLE THEN SERVE ELLIS NOTICE

00:40:57.788 --> 00:41:00.825
ON THOSE TENANTS WHO STAY.

00:41:00.891 --> 00:41:02.193
AND THE TENANTS WHO REMAIN ARE

00:41:02.259 --> 00:41:03.828
TYPICALLY THOSE THAT ARE MOST

00:41:03.894 --> 00:41:05.496
VULNERABLE TO HOMELESSNESS

00:41:05.563 --> 00:41:06.564
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.165

TENANTS THAT ARE THE TARGET OF

00:41:11.535 --> 00:41:13.103
THIS TACTIC.

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:14.371
AND SO ONCE THE ELLIS NOTICES

00:41:14.438 --> 00:41:15.840
ARE SERVED IN THOSE TENANTS ARE

00:41:15.906 --> 00:41:16.941
VICTIMS.

00:41:17.007 --> 00:41:18.509
THE LANDLORD WILL THEN RE RENT

00:41:18.576 --> 00:41:21.178
ONLY THOSE UNITS THAT ARE

00:41:21.245 --> 00:41:22.313

00:41:22.379 --> 00:41:24.181

00:41:25.616 --> 00:41:28.085

THIS WAS CALLED IN A OUR WITNESS

00:55:32.495 --> 00:55:33.663
OF DEBORAH YOU YOU MENTIONED

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:35.532
THAT THE AMENDMENT WILL TAKE

00:55:35.598 --> 00:55:39.436
AWAY WHAT 75% OF OF WHAT.

00:55:39.502 --> 00:55:41.604
CAN YOU CLARIFY THAT THE SIXTEEN

00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:42.972
IF IF THE AUTHOR ACCEPTS THE

STATEWIDE DATABASE THAT SHE

00:55:52.949 --> 00:55:57.387
WANTS NOT THAT WE WOULD SUPPORT

00:55:57.454 --> 00:56:01.491
IF SHE HAD A BACK IN.

00:56:01.558 --> 00:56:03.960
SECOND I CAN'T.

00:56:04.027 --> 00:56:04.427
BUT I DON'T THINK IT

00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:05.095
ACCOMPLISHES WE HAVE ARGUED THAT

00:56:05.161 --> 00:56:06.963

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:09.365
OUT THERE -- ON PUBLIC WEBSITES

00:56:09.432 --> 00:56:10.500
ON THE SENSES THE DATA THAT YOU

00:56:10.567 --> 00:56:11.334

TO COME INTO A SYSTEM.

00:56:20.009 --> 00:56:22.145
IS REALLY -- NOT NECESSARY I

00:56:22.212 --> 00:56:22.712
THINK WE GET THE DATA OTHER

00:56:22.779 --> 00:56:32.122
PLACES IN A MORE ECONOMICAL WAY.

00:56:32.188 --> 00:56:33.223

00:57:10.126 --> 00:57:12.028
DATABASE CAN -- COMPLIES WITH

00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:14.764
ALL STATE LAWS -- ON ON IN TERMS

00:57:14.831 --> 00:57:16.800
OF PRIVACY -- AND TO BE CLEAR

00:57:16.866 --> 00:57:17.867
THE DATA THAT WE WOULD BE

00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:19.202
SUGGESTING THAT WE'RE COLLECTING

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:21.237

00:57:21.304 --> 00:57:23.740
AT SPECIFIC TWO APARTMENT UNITS --

00:57:23.807 --> 00:57:25.809
WE DON'T NEED THE ACTUAL ADDRESS

00:57:25.875 --> 00:57:27.177

NUMBER OF BEDROOMS AND THE RENT

00:57:37.353 --> 00:57:40.590
IS X. -- AMOUNTS AND HAS CHANGED

00:57:40.657 --> 00:57:41.424
YEAR OVER YEAR I DON'T THINK

00:57:41.491 --> 00:57:42.826
THAT THAT WOULD VIOLATE THE

00:57:42.892 --> 00:57:44.961
PRIVACY OF OF ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO

00:57:45.028 --> 00:57:47.831

00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:55.839
FORD WOW WE ALL KNOW THAT

00:57:55.905 --> 00:57:56.472
RENTERS AND TENANTS ARE IN THE

00:57:56.539 --> 00:57:57.440
MOST.

00:57:57.507 --> 00:57:59.108
INTENSE CRISIS THAT THEY HAVE

00:57:59.175 --> 00:58:00.543
BEEN IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY AND

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:02.145
WE'RE HAVING MANY DISCUSSIONS

00:58:02.212 --> 00:58:03.746
ABOUT DIFFERENT IDEAS OF HOW TO

00:58:03.813 --> 00:58:05.448
ADDRESS THE CRISIS -- AND I

00:58:05.515 --> 00:58:07.016
THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE ON BOTH

00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:08.484
SIDES OF THE EQUATION THAT

00:58:08.551 --> 00:58:10.086
HAVING DATA HAVING FAX WOULD

00:58:10.153 --> 00:58:11.421
BETTER INFORM THIS.

00:58:11.487 --> 00:58:13.356
UP ONE THING I I I DO UNDERSTAND

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:14.190
FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT YOU

00:58:14.257 --> 00:58:15.558
BELIEVE THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES

00:58:15.625 --> 00:58:16.893
FOR US TO RECEIVE THIS DATA.

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:18.094
I HAVE TO ADMIT THATI HAVEN'T

00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:20.563
SEEN THEM AND SO IF YOU WANT TO

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:21.965

SEE WHATEVER YOU FEEL LIKE WE

00:58:25.401 --> 00:58:27.904
CAN CLEAN -- BUT SINCE WE

00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:28.838
HAVEN'T SEEN THAT I THINK WE

00:58:28.905 --> 00:58:30.740
HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH SOME

00:58:30.807 --> 00:58:32.342

THRESHOLD -- AND CERTAINLY

00:58:41.618 --> 00:58:43.353
UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS GOING --

00:58:43.419 --> 00:58:44.621
TO IT MEAN THAT WE WILL HAVE

00:58:44.687 --> 00:58:45.955
LESS DATA BUT I THINK HAVING

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:47.390
SOME DATA IS BETTER THAN HAVING

00:58:47.457 --> 00:58:49.692
NO DATA AND WITH THAT -- GLAD

00:58:49.759 --> 00:58:51.427

00:58:51.494 --> 00:58:53.496

WITH THE OPPOSITION BUT ACTUALLY

00:59:02.438 --> 00:59:06.576

POLICY POINTERS ONE EMPHASIZED

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:34.604
IS A SUMMER WORK SAID THIS IS

01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:35.371
REALLY ORIGINAL BILL FOCUSED ON

01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:37.273
THE HIGH COST AND FRANCISCO BAY

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:37.940
AREA AS A PILOT -- AND THE GOAL

01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:38.908
OF COURSE TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR

SUBSIDIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:46.249
NOT ENOUGH REALLY TO COMPETE IN

01:04:46.315 --> 01:04:47.783
THE MARKET FOR HIGHER UP PRICE

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:49.085
MARKET RATE UNITS TO TRY TO

01:04:49.151 --> 01:04:50.953
CREATE A NEW BELOW MARKET RATE

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.555
IS WE BELOW MARKET RATE UNITS.

01:04:52.622 --> 01:04:54.624
WITHOUT HAVING TO USE STATE AND

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:55.958
LOCAL SUBSIDIES AND THAT'S THE

01:04:56.025 --> 01:04:56.626
OTHER KEY POINT THE REASON THAT

01:04:56.692 --> 01:04:57.927
WE'RE REALLY HERE.

01:04:57.994 --> 01:04:58.594
IN PARTICULAR IN SUPPORT OF THE

01:04:58.661 --> 01:04:59.962
BILLS WERE SEEN A MOVEMENT AT

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:01.964
THE LOCAL LEVEL AT THE STATE

01:05:02.031 --> 01:05:03.232
MORE PRESSURE TO DIVERT.

01:05:03.299 --> 01:05:05.534
FINITE AND PRECIOUS AFFORDABLE

01:05:05.601 --> 01:05:06.802
HOUSING RESOURCE DIPPED OF

01:05:06.869 --> 01:05:07.803
HOUSEHOLDS OF HIGHER AND HIGHER

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:08.070
INCOMES.

01:05:08.137 --> 01:05:09.805
AND WE REALLY TO TARGET THOSE

01:05:09.872 --> 01:05:11.374
RESOURCES -- AT LOWER INCOME

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.509
HOUSEHOLDS FOR A 100% AFFORDABLE

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:15.144
HOUSING SO THE IDEAS CAN WE COME

01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:17.113
UP WITH ANOTHER PROGRAM THAT

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:18.514
DOESN'T REQUIRE TO TREAT THOSE

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:19.415
THOSE THOSE FIGHTING PRESSURES.

01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:21.317
RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

01:05:21.384 --> 01:05:22.652
THIS BELOW MARKET RATE.

01:05:22.718 --> 01:05:23.986
HOUSING AVAILABLE FOR THOSE WITH

01:05:24.053 --> 01:05:25.621
HIGHER INCOMES IN THAT WE THINK

01:05:25.688 --> 01:05:26.222
THAT'S A BETTER PUBLIC POLICY

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:27.023
APPROACH.

01:05:27.089 --> 01:05:29.125
AND THAT'S THE REASON WE'RE HERE

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:30.393
FOR EXAMPLE SB TO OR FROM THE

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:31.127
SOURCE FUNDING.

01:05:31.193 --> 01:05:32.962
DID ALLOCATE SOME FUNDING FOR

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:34.397
MIDDLE INCOME AND IS YOU KNOW

01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:35.431
GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS ALSO

INCOME PROGRAM WHICH GOES UP

01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:42.772
210020%.

01:05:42.838 --> 01:05:44.640
OF A IN MY SO WE THINK THOSE

01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:45.808
EFFORTS ARE FINE BUT THERE WON'T

01:05:45.875 --> 01:05:48.344
BE SUFFICIENT SUBSIDIES REALLY

01:05:48.411 --> 01:05:49.912
TO MAKE HEM UP TO THAT HAVE A

01:05:49.979 --> 01:05:50.579
LOT OF THE SCALE.

01:05:50.646 --> 01:05:52.014
SO WE THINK A PROGRAM LIKE THIS

01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:53.316
IS APPROPRIATE PARTICULARLY IN

01:05:53.382 --> 01:05:54.917

AND OUT OF THAT STUDY OUT OF

01:54:10.210 --> 01:54:11.211
THAT REFLECTION WHAT THEY REALLY

01:54:11.277 --> 01:54:12.779
DISCOVERED IS THAT AS YOU JUST

01:54:12.845 --> 01:54:14.547
HEARD THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY

01:54:14.614 --> 01:54:17.150
COLLEGE KIDS THAT ARE PURSUING.

01:54:17.217 --> 01:54:18.751
COLLEGE EDUCATION AT TRINA THE

01:54:18.818 --> 01:54:20.820
DREAM OF RECEIVING THAT DIPLOMA

SO WHAT WAS BORN OUT OF THAT WAS

01:54:26.025 --> 01:54:27.594
A PRODUCT THAT I AM CAL HAS BEEN

01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:29.028
REFERRING TO IS PURPOSE BUILT

01:54:29.095 --> 01:54:30.396
STUDENT HOUSING.

01:54:30.463 --> 01:54:32.565
IN FORM AND FUNCTION IN EVERY

01:54:32.632 --> 01:54:34.601
WAY IT LOOKS JUST LIKE ON CAMPUS

01:54:34.667 --> 01:54:36.002
DORMS.

01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:37.904
IT IS A SINGLE KITCHEN SINGLE

01:54:37.971 --> 01:54:39.939
COMMUNAL -- COMMUNAL LIVING ROOM

01:54:40.006 --> 01:54:42.041
AND IS SURROUNDED BY INDIVIDUAL

01:54:42.108 --> 01:54:43.843
ROOMS THAT ARE EACH INDIVIDUALLY

01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:46.279
RENTED EACH INDIVIDUALLY LOCKED.

01:54:46.346 --> 01:54:47.714
THEY THEN PARTNER UP WITH THE

01:54:47.780 --> 01:54:49.916
COLLEGE OR THE UNIVERSITY AND

01:54:49.983 --> 01:54:51.384
THE ADVERTISED THE PRODUCT

01:54:51.451 --> 01:54:53.319
ADVERTISE IT TO THE STUDENTS --

01:54:53.386 --> 01:54:55.388
AND THEY TRY TO WORK WITH THE

01:54:55.455 --> 01:54:57.023
COLLEGE TO GET IT LISTED AS

01:54:57.090 --> 01:54:59.158
OVERFLOW FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT

01:54:59.225 --> 01:55:00.460
SECURE ON CAMPUS HOUSING.

01:55:00.526 --> 01:55:02.228
UP PURPOSE BUILT HOUSING IS NOT

01:55:02.295 --> 01:55:04.230
DESIGNED FOR FAMILIES IT'S NOT

01:55:04.297 --> 01:55:05.765
CONDUCIVE FOR FAMILIES THAT'S

01:55:05.832 --> 01:55:07.567
THAT'S WHY IN THE FIVE TO SIX

01:55:07.634 --> 01:55:08.134
PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY

01:55:08.201 --> 01:55:08.701
BUILT.

01:55:08.768 --> 01:55:11.004
NO FAMILY HAS REQUESTED TO LIVE

01:55:11.070 --> 01:55:13.273
IN ANY OF THE SITUATIONS NOR DO

01:55:13.339 --> 01:55:13.873
WE EXPECT THEM EVER TO IN THE

01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:14.941
FUTURE.

01:55:15.008 --> 01:55:16.976
SO WE BELIEVE THAT -- THIS IS A

01:55:17.043 --> 01:55:18.745
RIGHT BALANCE TO SAY -- THERE

01:55:18.811 --> 01:55:20.380
NEEDS TO BE AN UNDERSTANDING

FIRST REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES

02:03:42.515 --> 02:03:44.383

02:03:44.450 --> 02:03:45.985

CONSTRUCTION 31% ON DEBT SERVICE

02:03:56.796 --> 02:03:59.331
AND SO ON THE LA -- FOUND THAT

02:03:59.398 --> 02:04:00.900
REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES HAD TWO

02:04:00.966 --> 02:04:02.935

THEY ALSO TENDED TO USE EMINENT

02:04:12.144 --> 02:04:15.915
DOMAIN -- TO TAKE PROPERTIES AND

02:04:15.981 --> 02:04:18.884
THEN LEAVE THOSE PROPERTIES --

02:04:18.951 --> 02:04:21.821
AN USED FOR YEARS AND YEARS ALL

02:04:21.887 --> 02:04:22.354
YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT

02:04:22.421 --> 02:04:25.090
DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO ON CASE

02:04:33.465 --> 02:04:36.068
REDEVELOPMENT MODEL IS REQUIRES

02:04:36.135 --> 02:04:39.205
BONDING AGAINST FUTURE PROPERTY

TAX INCREMENT.

02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:43.309
WITH THAT THAT IS A HIGH RISK

02:04:43.375 --> 02:04:46.111
BUDGET STRATEGY BECAUSE IT

02:04:46.178 --> 02:04:48.581
DEDICATES IT REQUIRES THE STATE

02:04:48.647 --> 02:04:50.316
ESSENTIALLY TO BACK FILL THE

02:04:50.382 --> 02:04:52.284
SCHOOL REVENUES FOR THIRTY OR

02:04:52.351 --> 02:04:53.686
FORTY YEARS.

02:04:53.752 --> 02:04:56.255
AND THIS IS BY THE WAY AND ONLY

02:04:56.322 --> 02:04:57.790
30% OF THAT BACK FILL GETS SPENT

02:04:57.857 --> 02:04:59.658

02:08:29.001 --> 02:08:30.569
FUNDS AND PROPERTY TAX VALUES

02:08:30.636 --> 02:08:32.738
WILL GO UP SO IF WE DON'T MAKE

02:08:32.805 --> 02:08:35.574
AN INVESTMENT -- ZERO TIMES ZERO

02:08:35.641 --> 02:08:37.876
IS NOT GONNA LEAD TO ANY GROWTH --

02:08:37.943 --> 02:08:38.710
ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT

02:08:38.777 --> 02:08:41.213
THIS BILL IS WE PUT IN MANY.

02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:43.715
SAFEGUARDS TO AVOID THE ABUSES

02:08:43.782 --> 02:08:45.217
OF THE PAST AND I DO UNDERSTAND

02:08:45.284 --> 02:08:46.652
GIVEN WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST

02:08:46.718 --> 02:08:47.753
THERE JUST A LOT OF CONCERNS

02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:48.921
THAT PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT WHAT WE

02:08:48.987 --> 02:08:50.122
DO IN THE FUTURE.

02:08:50.189 --> 02:08:51.824
WE DELIBERATELY PUT AND DETAILED

02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:53.826
RECORD RICKY RECORD KEEPING AN

02:08:53.892 --> 02:08:55.327
INDEPENDENT AUDIT REQUIREMENTS

02:08:55.394 --> 02:08:57.763
FINES FOR VIOLATIONS SIGNIFICANT

02:08:57.830 --> 02:09:00.365
GOVERNANCE PROVISIONS -- ROBUST

02:09:00.432 --> 02:09:02.101
PROVISIONS AROUND REPLACEMENT

02:09:02.167 --> 02:09:02.868
ANTI DISPLACEMENT TO REALLY

02:09:02.935 --> 02:09:04.403
ADDRESS WHAT HAPPENED IN THE

02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:09.408
PAST BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO

02:09:09.475 --> 02:09:09.808
OBVIOUSLY GO BACK.

02:09:09.875 --> 02:09:11.043
BUT MY PERSPECTIVE THE BABY DID

02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:11.610
GET THROWN OUT WITH THE BATH

02:09:11.677 --> 02:09:12.244
WATER AS I THINK YOU MAY KNOW

02:09:12.311 --> 02:09:13.879
FROM REDEVELOPMENT HISTORY --

02:09:13.946 --> 02:09:15.114
THE INTENT TO WIN THE

02:09:15.180 --> 02:09:17.983
LEGISLATURE VOTED TO END ASPECTS

02:09:18.050 --> 02:09:19.418
OF REDEVELOPMENT WERE NOT ENDED

02:09:19.485 --> 02:09:21.186
THERE WAS ESSENTIALLY A STRIPPED

02:09:21.253 --> 02:09:22.654
DOWN VERSION REPLACEMENT BUT

02:09:22.721 --> 02:09:24.256
BECAUSE OF A LAWSUIT.

02:09:24.323 --> 02:09:25.224
EVERYTHING ENDED UP GETTING

02:09:25.290 --> 02:09:26.492
THROWN OUT AND WE ARE NOW IN THE

02:09:26.558 --> 02:09:28.260
PLACE THAT WE ARE AND SO OUR

02:09:28.327 --> 02:09:29.928
GOAL IS TO KEEP WHAT.

02:09:29.995 --> 02:09:31.196
WE NEED FROM SO CALLED

02:09:31.263 --> 02:09:32.898
REDEVELOPMENT ATTACKS AND COMMIT

02:09:32.965 --> 02:09:34.800
FINANCING BUT TO ENSURE THAT --

02:09:34.867 --> 02:09:36.935
THAT THE EXCESSES OF THE PAST

02:09:37.002 --> 02:09:38.971
ARE NOT BROUGHT BACK.

02:09:39.037 --> 02:09:39.838
GOT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE

02:09:39.905 --> 02:09:41.874
EFFORT TO TO TRY TO REIN IN SOME

02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:43.208
OF THE THE ABUSES THAT WE SAW.

02:09:43.275 --> 02:09:44.543
THAT YOU KNOW IT SAYS THAT 30%

02:09:44.610 --> 02:09:45.744
OF THE MONEY HERE'S TO BE SET

02:09:45.811 --> 02:09:46.845
ASIDE FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING SO

02:09:46.912 --> 02:09:48.714
WHERE WERE MY THE OTHER 70% WIND

02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:50.315
UP CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WE TO

02:09:50.382 --> 02:09:51.350
FIND THAT VERY CAREFULLY

02:09:51.416 --> 02:09:52.951
WHATEVER YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND TO

02:09:53.018 --> 02:09:54.586
BE SORT OF INFRASTRUCTURE YOU

02:09:54.653 --> 02:09:55.454
NEED TO BUILD.

02:09:55.521 --> 02:09:57.756
AROUND HOUSING TO MAKE CHASE A

02:09:57.823 --> 02:09:59.391
COMMUNITY WORK THAT'S WHAT WE

02:09:59.458 --> 02:10:01.093
WOULD SET IT ASIDE FOR ONE THING

02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:02.127
I'LL JUST SAY ABOUT THAT NUMBER

02:10:02.194 --> 02:10:03.629
IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT IN

02:10:03.695 --> 02:10:05.831
REDEVELOPMENT ONE POINT NO.

02:10:05.898 --> 02:10:07.833
THE NUMBER WAS 20% -- THERE'S

02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:08.867
ANOTHER BILL MOVING IN THE

02:10:08.934 --> 02:10:10.269
SENATE THAT SUGGESTING THAT

02:10:10.335 --> 02:10:11.803
NUMBER OUGHT TO BE 50% WE

02:10:11.870 --> 02:10:13.005
THOUGHT TO SORT OF STRIKE IT

02:10:13.071 --> 02:10:15.674
DOWN THE MIDDLE 30% 70%.

02:10:15.741 --> 02:10:16.542
I AM OPEN TO WHAT THAT NUMBER

02:10:16.608 --> 02:10:18.510
SHOULD BE BASED ON WHAT THE

02:10:18.577 --> 02:10:20.445
CONSENSUS OF THE BODY IS BUT WE

02:10:20.512 --> 02:10:21.346
CERTAINLY THINK GIVEN THE

02:10:21.413 --> 02:10:22.447
HOUSING CRISIS AND THE

02:10:22.514 --> 02:10:23.849
INFRASTRUCTURE CRISES THAT WE'RE

02:10:23.916 --> 02:10:24.783
IN RIGHT NOW.

02:10:24.850 --> 02:10:27.419
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING MORE

02:10:27.486 --> 02:10:28.854
THAN WHAT WE ARE DOING.

02:10:28.921 --> 02:10:30.289
IT DOES THE BILL -- CONTAIN ANY

02:10:30.355 --> 02:10:31.657
OTHER CONSTRAINTS ON THE USE OF

02:10:31.723 --> 02:10:32.791
EMINENT DOMAIN I SUPPOSE WHAT

02:10:32.858 --> 02:10:33.292
YOU JUST SAID COULD BE

02:10:33.358 --> 02:10:34.426
CONSIDERED ONE CONSTRAINT IN

02:10:34.493 --> 02:10:35.827
TERMS OF THE TYPE OF PROJECTS

02:10:35.894 --> 02:10:37.029
WHERE THERE'S A THEIR SUBJECTS

02:10:37.095 --> 02:10:38.697
THAT WERE CONDEMNATION CAN BE.

02:10:38.764 --> 02:10:40.432
USED AS A TOOL BUT OTHER OTHER --

02:10:40.499 --> 02:10:41.833
LIMITS -- IN THIS BILL THAT

02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:43.635
DIDN'T EXIST IN THE PREVIOUS

02:10:43.702 --> 02:10:44.803
REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WE DON'T

02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:48.073
ADDRESS THAT IN OUR BILL -- WE'D

02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:49.474
BE IT JUST WASN'T A TOPIC WE

02:10:49.541 --> 02:10:51.109
THOUGHT WE NEEDED WHAT WE WE

02:10:51.176 --> 02:10:52.811
OUGHT TO ADDRESS IN THIS BILL

02:10:52.878 --> 02:10:55.047
WHAT I WILL SAY IS THERE ARE --

02:10:55.113 --> 02:10:55.948
MANY CHALLENGES TO MOVING

02:10:56.014 --> 02:10:57.282
FORWARD WITH EMINENT DOMAIN

02:10:57.349 --> 02:10:58.650
THERE ARE.

02:10:58.717 --> 02:11:00.385
MANY HURDLES THAT A LOCAL

02:11:00.452 --> 02:11:01.787
JURISDICTION IS TO GO THROUGH

02:11:01.853 --> 02:11:04.923
BUT THAT WASN'T OR HAS NOT BEEN

02:11:04.990 --> 02:11:06.725
A FOCUS OF THIS BILL -- YEAH I'D

02:11:06.792 --> 02:11:08.694
ENCOURAGE THAT TO BE -- YOU KNOW

02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:09.628
SOME OF THE WE GIVE SOME

02:11:09.695 --> 02:11:10.529
ATTENTION TO BECAUSE I THINK

02:11:10.596 --> 02:11:13.065
THAT THERE WAS A TRACK RECORD OF

02:11:13.131 --> 02:11:14.266
IT BEING USED IN SOME WAYS THAT

02:11:14.333 --> 02:11:16.969
WERE -- PRETTY -- FOR BAD FOR

02:11:17.035 --> 02:11:17.603
PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE

02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:19.438
PAST -- IF FINAL QUESTION YOU

02:11:19.504 --> 02:11:20.706
KNOW -- THIS IN ANOTHER WAY ON

02:11:20.772 --> 02:11:22.808
THAT POINT WE DO HAVE PROVISIONS

02:11:22.874 --> 02:11:23.976
THERE WERE MANY TIMES WHEN

02:11:24.042 --> 02:11:25.377
EMINENT DOMAIN WAS USE THAT

02:11:25.444 --> 02:11:27.246
ENDED UP DISPLACING SENSITIVE

02:11:27.312 --> 02:11:28.880
AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES.

02:11:28.947 --> 02:11:31.283
AND AND WITHOUT ANY SENSE OF

02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:32.050
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN OF THOSE

02:11:32.117 --> 02:11:33.418
COMMUNITIES AFTERWARDS AND WE DO

02:11:33.485 --> 02:11:35.220
HAVE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL TO

02:11:35.287 --> 02:11:36.255
DEAL WITH THAT.

02:11:36.321 --> 02:11:38.557
OKAY IT'S GOOD TO HEAR -- AND

02:11:38.624 --> 02:11:39.491
THERE'S A STATISTIC GOT MISTER

02:11:39.558 --> 02:11:40.359
NEVER MENTIONS FROM THE

02:11:40.425 --> 02:11:41.560
CALIFORNIA BUDGET PROJECT THAT

02:11:41.627 --> 02:11:42.928
ONLY ABOUT 11%.

02:11:42.995 --> 02:11:44.263
OF THE FUNDS I PREVIOUSLY WOULD

02:11:44.329 --> 02:11:45.430
IN THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION YOU

02:11:45.497 --> 02:11:47.299
HAVE ANY SENSE OF OF WHY THAT

02:11:47.366 --> 02:11:48.867
WAS SO LOW AND HOW THAT.

02:11:48.934 --> 02:11:50.002
IS BEING ADDRESSED HERE I THINK

02:11:50.068 --> 02:11:51.770
YOU JUST BE THE NUMBER I I THINK

02:11:51.837 --> 02:11:53.639
THAT'S CORRECT -- I DON'T

02:11:53.705 --> 02:11:55.107
DISPUTE THE NUMBER I THINK THE

02:11:55.173 --> 02:11:56.808
REALITY IS -- THE STATE AND WAS

02:11:56.875 --> 02:11:58.076
NOT IN THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT

02:11:58.143 --> 02:11:59.911
WE'RE IN NOW AND BOY IF WE COULD

02:11:59.978 --> 02:12:00.479
HAVE TWO AND A HALF BILLION

02:12:00.545 --> 02:12:02.281
DOLLARS TO SPEND ON HOUSING I

02:12:02.347 --> 02:12:06.051
HAVE A FEELING OUR COLLEAGUES

02:12:06.118 --> 02:12:08.987
WOULD KNOW HOW TO USE IT.

02:12:09.054 --> 02:12:11.223
WE HAVE A OF MOTION AND ANY

02:12:11.290 --> 02:12:12.924
SECOND ON THE FLOOR ANY OTHER

02:12:12.991 --> 02:12:14.159
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM

02:12:14.226 --> 02:12:15.627
COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

02:12:15.694 --> 02:12:17.396
I GUESS JUST HAVE -- ONE GERMAN

02:12:17.462 --> 02:12:18.997
IN IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS YOU

02:12:19.064 --> 02:12:20.432
HAD MENTIONED THAT -- YOU TO

02:12:23.001 --> 02:12:26.438
OF SOME OPPOSITIONS -- I'D.

02:12:26.505 --> 02:12:27.105
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A FLOOD

02:12:27.172 --> 02:12:29.341
IF YOU DO YOU KNOW IF -- THE

02:12:29.408 --> 02:12:30.709
CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL

02:12:30.776 --> 02:12:32.177
FIREFIGHTERS IN THE THE CTA.

02:12:32.244 --> 02:12:34.513
ARE THEY STILL NEUTRAL IN THIS

02:12:34.579 --> 02:12:37.082
OR OR TO THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU

02:12:37.149 --> 02:12:38.517
ACCEPTED DID I BRING HIM TO TO

02:12:38.583 --> 02:12:40.252
NEUTRALITY OR IT'S IT'S A GOOD

02:12:40.319 --> 02:12:41.687
QUESTION THERE THEY'RE NOT HERE

02:12:41.753 --> 02:12:44.389
I I DON'T KNOW. FOR SURE -- THE

02:12:44.456 --> 02:12:45.357
ISSUE THAT THEY HAD REYES WERE

02:12:45.424 --> 02:12:46.892
AROUND SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND

02:12:46.958 --> 02:12:48.226
MAKING SURE THAT WE WERE KEEPING

02:12:48.293 --> 02:12:49.928
THEM WHOLE AND THAT WAS THE

02:12:49.995 --> 02:12:51.096
INTENT OF THE MOMENT SO WE'VE

02:12:51.163 --> 02:12:52.931
TAKEN AT THE REQUEST OF THE

02:12:52.998 --> 02:12:54.232
COUNTY SPECIAL DISTRICTS IN

02:12:54.299 --> 02:12:55.434
SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:56.168
THAT THEIR PROPERTY TAX

02:12:56.234 --> 02:12:58.136
ALLOCATION WOULD BE IMPACTED SO

02:12:58.203 --> 02:12:59.538
WE'VE TAKEN THOSE MOMENTS I DO

02:12:59.604 --> 02:13:01.807
HOPE IT GOES A LONG WAY TOWARD

02:13:01.873 --> 02:13:05.744
ADDRESSING THOSE CONCERNS BUT I

02:13:05.811 --> 02:13:06.345
JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE

02:13:06.411 --> 02:13:07.212

ALL KNOW IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN

02:13:14.786 --> 02:13:15.520
THIS WAS A VERY DIFFICULT

02:13:15.587 --> 02:13:16.888
CONVERSATION I THINK THERE'S

02:13:16.955 --> 02:13:18.590
BEEN A LOT OF BUYER'S REMORSE --

02:13:18.657 --> 02:13:21.860
BUT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW --

02:13:21.927 --> 02:13:24.129
TO TO USE A ROBUST TOOL TO BUILD

02:13:24.196 --> 02:13:25.530
A HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE

02:13:25.597 --> 02:13:26.531

ASKING FOR SOMETHING IN THIS

02:13:32.304 --> 02:13:33.772
AREA AND SORE HOPE IS THAT WE

02:13:33.839 --> 02:13:35.307

02:13:35.374 --> 02:13:36.908
THIS TAKES LOOK FOR TO FUTURE

02:13:36.975 --> 02:13:38.310
CONVERSATIONS ON WAYS THAT WE

02:13:38.377 --> 02:13:39.511
CAN KEEP IMPROVING THIS.

02:13:39.578 --> 02:13:41.813
BUT AT THIS POINT I CERTAINLY

02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:43.582

HOUSING CRISIS IN THE BAY AREA --

02:14:52.617 --> 02:14:54.920
AS ALL OF YOU I BELIEVE KNOW OUR

02:14:54.986 --> 02:14:57.088
REGION HAS BEEN THE EPICENTER OF

02:14:57.155 --> 02:14:58.490

THE BAY AREA FACES IS CRISIS FOR

A NUMBER OF REASONS BUT ONE IN

02:15:12.771 --> 02:15:14.539
PARTICULAR AS A REGION WE HAVE

02:15:14.606 --> 02:15:16.541
FAILED TO PRODUCE HOUSING AT ALL

02:15:16.608 --> 02:15:17.809
INCOME LEVELS WE FAILED TO

02:15:17.876 --> 02:15:19.344
PRESERVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

02:15:19.411 --> 02:15:20.479
WE FAIL TO PROTECT RESIDENTS

02:15:20.545 --> 02:15:22.414
FROM DISPLACEMENT AT A TIME WHEN

02:15:22.481 --> 02:15:24.616
JOB CREATION HAS BEEN AT A

02:15:24.683 --> 02:15:25.951
RECORD HIGH WITH OUR REGION.

02:15:26.017 --> 02:15:27.786
WELL HOUSING IS A REGIONAL ISSUE

02:15:27.853 --> 02:15:29.955
THAT REQUIRES POLICY AND FUNDING

02:15:30.021 --> 02:15:31.323
COORDINATION THERE HAS NOT BEEN

02:15:31.389 --> 02:15:33.258
THIS REGIONAL APPROACH IN THE

02:15:33.325 --> 02:15:33.925
BAY.

02:15:33.992 --> 02:15:35.293
INSTEAD WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND

02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:36.528
ONE CITIES AND NINE COUNTIES

02:15:36.595 --> 02:15:38.964

02:15:40.232 --> 02:15:41.633
ADDRESS THE CRISIS.

02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:42.934
THE CONCEPT FOR THIS BILL CAME

02:15:43.001 --> 02:15:44.402
FROM A DIVERSE COALITION F BAY

02:15:44.469 --> 02:15:46.571
AREA HOUSING STAKEHOLDERS THAT

02:15:46.638 --> 02:15:47.572

02:15:47.639 --> 02:15:48.707
WHO CAME TOGETHER TO ASK THE

02:15:48.773 --> 02:15:50.442
STATE TO EMPOWER OUR REGION TO

02:15:50.509 --> 02:15:51.843
HELP OURSELVES?

02:15:51.910 --> 02:15:53.778
BECAUSE NO PUBLIC ENTITY IN THE

02:15:53.845 --> 02:15:54.613
BAY AREA HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON

02:15:54.679 --> 02:15:56.114
HOUSING THIS BILL WOULD

02:15:56.181 --> 02:15:57.449
ESTABLISH A REGIONAL HOUSING

02:15:57.516 --> 02:15:59.117
ENTITY WHICH WE REFER TO AS THE

02:15:59.184 --> 02:16:00.752
HOUSING ALLIANCE FOR THE BAY

02:16:00.819 --> 02:16:01.753
AREA.

02:16:01.820 --> 02:16:03.388
LIKE PREVIOUS STATE BILLS IT

02:16:03.455 --> 02:16:04.656
CREATED THE BAY AREA TOLL

02:16:04.723 --> 02:16:05.857

AN ENTITY FOCUSED ON A REGION'S

02:16:14.466 --> 02:16:15.500
HOUSING NEEDS.

02:16:15.567 --> 02:16:16.835
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT OUR REGION

02:16:16.902 --> 02:16:18.703
ALONE NEEDS AN ADDITIONAL TWO

02:16:18.770 --> 02:16:19.905
AND A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS A

02:16:19.971 --> 02:16:21.773
YEAR TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING

OUR REGION TO RAISE REVENUES

02:16:33.184 --> 02:16:33.718
WITHOUT FURTHER BURDENING THE

02:16:33.785 --> 02:16:34.452
STATE.

02:16:34.519 --> 02:16:36.388
THESE REVENUES WOULD BE ADDITIVE

02:16:36.454 --> 02:16:37.455
TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDING

02:16:37.522 --> 02:16:38.790
ALREADY AVAILABLE IN THE REGION

02:16:38.857 --> 02:16:40.058
AND THE ENTITY WOULD NOT DIVERT

02:16:40.125 --> 02:16:44.229
ANY EXISTING FUNDING STREAMS

02:16:44.296 --> 02:16:45.096
FROM LOCAL JURIST TIONS.

WITH THESE FUNDS THE ENTITY

02:16:45.730 --> 02:16:47.098

SAY IT AGAIN WE HAVE AN

02:23:34.906 --> 02:23:36.941
AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IN THE

02:23:37.008 --> 02:23:38.343
STATE OF CALIFORNIA LISTEN THE

02:23:38.409 --> 02:23:40.211
ONLY 30% OF CALIFORNIANS CAN

02:23:40.278 --> 02:23:41.746
AFFORD A MEDIAN PRICED HOME IN

02:23:41.813 --> 02:23:42.647
THE STATE.

02:23:42.714 --> 02:23:44.515
IT COSTS THREE HUNDRED AND

02:23:44.582 --> 02:23:45.083
THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON

02:23:45.149 --> 02:23:46.985
AVERAGE TO BUILD AN AFFORDABLE

IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA

02:23:50.355 --> 02:23:52.256
IT'S OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:23:52.323 --> 02:23:53.057
DOLLARS TO BUILD A UNIT OF

02:23:53.124 --> 02:23:54.592
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

02:23:54.659 --> 02:23:56.761
SO IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT WE NEED

02:23:56.828 --> 02:23:59.097
MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND

02:23:59.163 --> 02:24:00.198
MEMBERS WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE

02:24:00.264 --> 02:24:02.467
LEGISLATURE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY

02:24:02.533 --> 02:24:04.369
IN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL

02:24:04.435 --> 02:24:04.936
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

02:24:05.003 --> 02:24:06.938
BUT WHEN ONLY 30% OF

CALIFORNIANS CAN AFFORD A MEDIAN

02:24:08.439 --> 02:24:12.276
PRICED HOME ADVOCATING -- FOR

02:24:12.343 --> 02:24:13.745
NEW PERSONAL TAXES WHICH ARE

02:24:13.811 --> 02:24:15.346
VERY REGRESSIVE WHICH DIRECTLY

02:24:15.413 --> 02:24:17.081
IMPACT PROPERTY OWNERS ARE NOT

02:24:17.148 --> 02:24:19.117
GONNA DO ANYTHING TO PROVIDE

02:24:19.183 --> 02:24:20.518
ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

02:24:20.585 --> 02:24:22.020
AND AGAIN WE DO BELIEVE THE

02:24:22.086 --> 02:24:23.588
LEGISLATURE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY

02:24:23.654 --> 02:24:25.390
THEY CAN LOWER IMPACT FEES THEY

02:24:25.456 --> 02:24:27.158
CAN REFORM INCLUSIONARY ZONING

02:24:27.225 --> 02:24:28.659
TO ACTUALLY PROMOTE UNIT

02:24:28.726 --> 02:24:29.594
DEVELOPMENT.

02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:31.295
THEY CAN REMOVE COSTLY MANDATES

02:24:31.362 --> 02:24:32.630
A NEW DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING RENT

02:24:32.697 --> 02:24:34.665
CONTROL AND SOLAR PANELS ON NEW

02:24:34.732 --> 02:24:36.467
HOMES -- THEY CAN REMOVE

02:24:36.534 --> 02:24:38.469
REGULATORY BURDENS ON SEQUEL

02:24:38.536 --> 02:24:39.704
LOST -- MAINTAINING ALL OF ITS

02:24:39.771 --> 02:24:41.572
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS WHICH

02:24:41.639 --> 02:24:43.941
WE WOULD BE IN SUPPORT OF WE

02:24:44.008 --> 02:24:45.410
NEED TO TAKE THE STEPS MEMBERS

02:24:45.476 --> 02:24:47.345
AND NOT JUST LOOK AT AUTHORIZING

02:24:47.412 --> 02:24:48.780
NEW REVENUE SOURCES TO FIX THIS

02:24:48.846 --> 02:24:49.647
PROBLEM.

02:24:49.714 --> 02:24:51.783
REVENUE HAS A PIECE TO THAT WE

02:24:51.849 --> 02:24:53.451
DIDN'T TAKE A POSITION ON THE

02:24:53.518 --> 02:24:55.219
HOUSING BOND LAST YEAR WHEN IT

02:24:55.286 --> 02:24:56.387
WAS ON THE BALLOT.

02:24:56.454 --> 02:24:58.022
YOU KNOW REVENUE DOES HAVE A

02:24:58.089 --> 02:25:00.091
ROLE TO PLAY IN THIS BUT IT'S

02:25:00.158 --> 02:25:01.759
NOT THE ONLY ROLE I THINK THIS

02:25:01.826 --> 02:25:03.161
LEGISLATURE CAN DO MORE NEEDS TO

02:25:03.227 --> 02:25:05.863
DO MORE BEFORE WE ADVANCEMENT

02:25:05.930 --> 02:25:09.867
PROGRAMS SUCH AS THIS TASK FOR

02:25:09.934 --> 02:25:11.903

02:25:27.018 --> 02:25:28.352
APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE FROM

02:25:28.419 --> 02:25:30.254
HOWARD JARVIS SO THIS BILL DOES

02:25:30.321 --> 02:25:31.055
NOT.

02:25:31.122 --> 02:25:32.757
AUTOMATICALLY AUTHORIZE REVENUES

02:25:32.824 --> 02:25:34.225
WHAT IT DOES IS IT ESTABLISHES A

02:25:34.292 --> 02:25:35.893
REGIONAL BODY MADE UP OF LOCAL

02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:37.595
ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT COULD

DECIDE AMONG A VARIETY OF

02:25:39.397 --> 02:25:40.832
POTENTIAL REVENUE OPTIONS.
