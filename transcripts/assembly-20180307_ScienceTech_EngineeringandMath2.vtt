ACTIVISM.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:21.901 region:rollup2
IT LOOKS LIKE THIS IT SHOULD BE

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:23.002 region:rollup2
IN PACKETS YOU HAVE AND WE HAVE

00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:24.470 region:rollup2
HARD COPIES FOR ANYBODY WHO

00:18:23.002 --> 00:18:26.372 region:rollup2
WANTS.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:28.140 region:rollup2
MORE I'M JUST GOING TO WALK YOU

00:18:26.372 --> 00:18:29.408 region:rollup2
THROUGH IT VERY BRIEFLY AND THEN

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.110 region:rollup2
TURN IT OVER TO SOME OF OUR

00:18:29.408 --> 00:18:32.945 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES WHO CAN TELL YOU

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.714 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW THESE PRACTICES. HAVE

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:36.282 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WORKED OVER THE LAST

00:18:34.714 --> 00:18:38.651 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS.

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:40.553 region:rollup2
FIRST WE START WITH WHY IS

00:18:38.651 --> 00:18:42.188 region:rollup2
EARLY NOW IMPORTANT SOME PEOPLE

00:18:40.553 --> 00:18:43.489 region:rollup2
SEEM TO THINK THAT IT'S NOT AS

00:18:42.188 --> 00:18:45.925 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AS THINGS LIKE

00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:48.861 region:rollup2
LITERACY. AND IT'S REALLY KEY

00:18:45.925 --> 00:18:51.330 region:rollup2
FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS ONE IS

00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:52.732 region:rollup2
MATH PROFICIENCY AT KINDERGARTEN

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:54.033 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE AS

00:18:52.732 --> 00:18:56.702 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT A PREDICTOR OF EARLY

00:18:54.033 --> 00:18:59.972 region:rollup2
OF FUTURE ACADEMIC SUCCESS. IN

00:18:56.702 --> 00:19:01.874 region:rollup2
ALL DISCIPLINES AS LITERACY.

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:03.843 region:rollup2
ARE AND YET IT'S TAUGHT A

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:06.479 region:rollup2
FRACTION OF THE AMOUNT.

00:19:03.843 --> 00:19:08.748 region:rollup2
BY KINDERGARTEN THERE'S ALREADY

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:10.783 region:rollup2
A DEMONSTRATED ACHIEVEMENT GAP

00:19:08.748 --> 00:19:12.318 region:rollup2
GUESS WHAT CORRELATED TO THINGS

00:19:10.783 --> 00:19:13.853 region:rollup2
LIKE INCOME AND.

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:16.222 region:rollup2
ETHNIC.

00:19:13.853 --> 00:19:19.325 region:rollup2
I BACKGROUND AND THOSE KINDS OF

00:19:16.222 --> 00:19:21.160 region:rollup2
SOCIO ECONOMIC FACTORS. THE GAP

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:22.661 region:rollup2
FIVE STARTS OUT A KINDERGARTEN

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.363 region:rollup2
AT TWENTY MONTHS

00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:26.065 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KIDS WHO

00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:27.366 region:rollup2
ARE LIKE SIXTEEN MONTHS OLD. AND

00:19:26.065 --> 00:19:29.468 region:rollup2
THEY'VE GOT A TWENTY MONTH.

00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:32.338 region:rollup2
HANDICAP WHEN THEY WHEN THEY

00:19:29.468 --> 00:19:34.707 region:rollup2
GET TO FORMAL SCHOOLING KELLY

00:19:32.338 --> 00:19:36.776 region:rollup2
GETS WORSE AS STUDENTS WHO FLEW

00:19:34.707 --> 00:19:39.812 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:19:36.776 --> 00:19:41.614 region:rollup2
A.

00:19:39.812 --> 00:19:43.516 region:rollup2
A MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

00:19:41.614 --> 00:19:45.117 region:rollup2
SCHOOL STUDENTS GRADUATE FROM

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:47.053 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL UNPREPARED. AS

00:19:45.117 --> 00:19:48.754 region:rollup2
DOCTOR ARISTA POINTED OUT FOR

00:19:47.053 --> 00:19:51.123 region:rollup2
COLLEGE LEVEL MATH.

00:19:48.754 --> 00:19:53.092 region:rollup2
I THIS COST THEM TIME AND MONEY

00:19:51.123 --> 00:19:55.728 region:rollup2
IS BOMB SOME OUT THEY GET

00:19:53.092 --> 00:19:56.996 region:rollup2
DEPRESSED AND OFTEN THAT'S.

00:19:55.728 --> 00:19:58.998 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN NOT

00:19:56.996 --> 00:20:00.1000 region:rollup2
COMPLETING THE FOUR YEAR DEGREE

00:19:58.998 --> 00:20:02.301 region:rollup2
IN SIX YEARS OR ANY OTHER NUMBER

00:20:00.1000 --> 00:20:04.270 region:rollup2
OF YEARS.

00:20:02.301 --> 00:20:06.539 region:rollup2
I AS W KNOW CALIFORNIA'S

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:08.274 region:rollup2
ECONOMY IS DRIVEN BY STEM STEAM

MILLION ENTRY LEVEL JOBS YEAH

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:13.512 region:rollup2
REQUIRE IT IN STEAM.

00:20:12.111 --> 00:20:15.448 region:rollup2
.

00:20:13.512 --> 00:20:17.716 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINES COMING UP WITHIN THE

00:20:15.448 --> 00:20:19.652 region:rollup2
NEXT FIVE YEARS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:22.488 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYERS WHO'VE SIGNED ON

00:20:19.652 --> 00:20:24.657 region:rollup2
TO OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS

PROVIDE AMPLE TESTIMONY ABOUT

00:20:24.657 --> 00:20:30.663 region:rollup2
THE.

00:20:28.494 --> 00:20:32.098 region:rollup2
I COME FROM BAYER CORPORATION

YOU KNOW AND LEAD SORT OF

00:20:32.098 --> 00:20:36.268 region:rollup2
CHARACTERIZE IT AS STARVATION

00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:38.270 region:rollup2
MODE THAT EMPLOYERS ARE AND. FOR

LOCAL TALENT ESPECIALLY IN A

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.473 region:rollup2
HIGH COST OF LIVING AREA LIKE

00:20:39.305 --> 00:20:42.808 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

00:20:40.473 --> 00:20:43.642 region:rollup2
I AND FINALLY CALIFORNIA RANKS

00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:46.145 region:rollup2
AT THE BOTTOM THE HOUSE FOR

00:20:43.642 --> 00:20:47.813 region:rollup2
YEARS. AYE FOR THINGS LIKE

00:20:46.145 --> 00:20:50.116 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE

00:20:47.813 --> 00:20:52.985 region:rollup2
DEGREE COMPLETION ESPECIALLY

00:20:50.116 --> 00:20:54.253 region:rollup2
AMONG STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND WE

00:20:52.985 --> 00:20:56.422 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY NEED TO FIX THAT

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:58.491 region:rollup2
AND WE CAN'T.

00:20:56.422 --> 00:21:00.459 region:rollup2
SO I A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE

00:20:58.491 --> 00:21:02.161 region:rollup2
ACTUAL POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:04.697 region:rollup2
WINE IS TO BEGIN BY LAUNCHING A

00:21:02.161 --> 00:21:06.265 region:rollup2
BROAD PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN.

00:21:04.697 --> 00:21:09.902 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:11.837 region:rollup2
MATH EDUCATION. AND HOW FUN IT

00:21:09.902 --> 00:21:13.572 region:rollup2
CAN BE ARE AND HOW IMPORTANT IT

00:21:11.837 --> 00:21:15.207 region:rollup2
IS IS A FACTOR IN FUTURE ADULTS

00:21:13.572 --> 00:21:18.010 region:rollup2
SUCCESS.

00:21:15.207 --> 00:21:20.012 region:rollup2
I DO TOO IS PROVIDE PARENTS AND

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:22.014 region:rollup2
CAREGIVERS WITH AFFORDABLE MATH

00:21:20.012 --> 00:21:23.716 region:rollup2
EDUCATION RESOURCE SINCE. ARM

00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:25.484 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN THAT ARE FUN MATH

00:21:23.716 --> 00:21:28.120 region:rollup2
EDUCATION THAT AN EARLY AGE IS

00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:29.255 region:rollup2
FUN. AYE TRACK I MEAN I'M AN

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.423 region:rollup2
ENGLISH MAJOR BUT IT MIGHT EVEN

00:21:29.255 --> 00:21:33.092 region:rollup2
BE MORE FUN THAN LITERACY SO.

00:21:31.423 --> 00:21:34.727 region:rollup2
GET WAY THAT YOU'VE GOT TO TELL

00:21:33.092 --> 00:21:35.594 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT THEY DON'T KNOW IT

00:21:34.727 --> 00:21:37.496 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S THE POINT OF THE

00:21:35.594 --> 00:21:38.264 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION IS TO GET THAT

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:41.066 region:rollup2
WORD OUT.

00:21:38.264 --> 00:21:42.568 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY IT'S IN THIS GETS A

00:21:41.066 --> 00:21:44.270 region:rollup2
LITTLE MORE COMPLEX BUT WE CAN

00:21:42.568 --> 00:21:46.405 region:rollup2
DO IT. BY INCREASINGLY

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:48.407 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING AND EXPERTISE OF

00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:50.376 region:rollup2
EARLY EDUCATION PROVIDERS ARM

00:21:48.407 --> 00:21:52.211 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S STARTING IN PRESCHOOL

00:21:50.376 --> 00:21:53.646 region:rollup2
AND CHILDCARE.

00:21:52.211 --> 00:21:55.781 region:rollup2
IT MEANS PROFESSIONAL

00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:57.449 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS. ARE IT

00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:59.251 region:rollup2
MEANS RETHINKING CREDENTIALING

00:21:57.449 --> 00:22:00.886 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS IN INCENTIVIZING

00:21:59.251 --> 00:22:03.289 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION. IT MEANS

00:22:00.886 --> 00:22:05.591 region:rollup2
INSTITUTING MOSCOW'S ASSESSMENTS

00:22:03.289 --> 00:22:07.493 region:rollup2
OF STUDENTS EARLY ON SO THAT WE

00:22:05.591 --> 00:22:08.828 region:rollup2
CAN TELL WHAT'S WORKING AND

00:22:07.493 --> 00:22:09.595 region:rollup2
WHERE THE GAPS NEED.

00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:12.164 region:rollup2
TO BE FILLED.

00:22:09.595 --> 00:22:12.698 region:rollup2
.

00:22:12.164 --> 00:22:14.033 region:rollup2
I THINK IT LEAVES ONE MORE

00:22:12.698 --> 00:22:16.368 region:rollup2
THING.

00:22:14.033 --> 00:22:18.337 region:rollup2
I KNOW BECAUSE IT'S SO THESE

00:22:16.368 --> 00:22:20.206 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE START. I DO

00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:21.974 region:rollup2
NOT THIS COMPLETE SOLUTION TO

00:22:20.206 --> 00:22:23.375 region:rollup2
STEM EDUCATION WE CAN TALK ABOUT

00:22:21.974 --> 00:22:26.312 region:rollup2
THAT MAYBE AT SOME OTHER FUTURE

00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:28.314 region:rollup2
MEETING BUT THEY'RE DOABLE AND

00:22:26.312 --> 00:22:31.650 region:rollup2
WOOD HEALED YOU ARE MISS RESULTS

STUDY.

00:22:33.085 --> 00:22:36.589 region:rollup2
SEAN HOW IT WORKS.

00:22:35.821 --> 00:22:38.591 region:rollup2
REGULAR SESSION AND THERE'D BE

00:22:36.589 --> 00:22:40.292 region:rollup2

00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:55.734 region:rollup2
HEY REPUBLIC STABLE HOOD IS THE

00:23:53.732 --> 00:23:57.469 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY BASED INITIATIVE THAT

00:23:55.734 --> 00:23:58.737 region:rollup2
RECEIVED A PROMISED NEIGHBORHOOD

00:23:57.469 --> 00:24:00.673 region:rollup2
AWARD IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN.

00:23:58.737 --> 00:24:02.408 region:rollup2
AND WE WERE WHEN THE FIRST FIVE

00:24:00.673 --> 00:24:03.909 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES IN THE COUNTRY WE

00:24:02.408 --> 00:24:05.744 region:rollup2
WERE THE ONLY PUBLIC UNIVERSITY

TO LEAD ONE OF THE AWARDS.

00:24:05.744 --> 00:24:09.682 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT A PART OF IT HAD

00:24:07.246 --> 00:24:10.516 region:rollup2
A LOT OF FAITH IN THE COMMUNITY.

00:24:09.682 --> 00:24:11.684 region:rollup2

SHOULD BE ENGAGED IN THIS WORK I

00:24:12.918 --> 00:24:16.622 region:rollup2
SAY. UNIVERSITIES MUST BE

00:24:15.054 --> 00:24:17.756 region:rollup2
ENGAGED IN THIS WORK THIS IS THE

00:24:16.622 --> 00:24:19.758 region:rollup2
WORK.

00:24:17.756 --> 00:24:20.492 region:rollup2
OF EDUCATION.

00:24:19.758 --> 00:24:21.961 region:rollup2

IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:28.801 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN.

00:24:27.232 --> 00:24:30.169 region:rollup2
THE DATA THAT I'M GOING TO SHOW

00:24:28.801 --> 00:24:31.837 region:rollup2
YOU TODAY IS FROM THE FIRST FIVE

00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:33.505 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:24:31.837 --> 00:24:35.441 region:rollup2
OF OUR WORK WE HAD A TRANSITION

00:24:33.505 --> 00:24:37.109 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:24:35.441 --> 00:24:38.877 region:rollup2
AND BASED ON THE COMMITMENT OF

TOGETHER APPLIED FOR ANOTHER

00:24:40.446 --> 00:24:45.217 region:rollup2
AWARD AND RECEIVED THE GOOD NEWS

00:24:43.082 --> 00:24:46.852 region:rollup2
JERRY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THAT

00:24:45.217 --> 00:24:48.454 region:rollup2
WE WERE A SECOND A WORDY. TO

00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:50.322 region:rollup2
SCALE UP THE WORK TO A NEW

00:24:48.454 --> 00:24:52.925 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOOD UP THREE SENSES

00:24:50.322 --> 00:24:53.826 region:rollup2
CAME UP THREE CENSUS BLOCK AREA.

00:24:52.925 --> 00:24:55.160 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S IN THE TENNIS AND

00:24:53.826 --> 00:24:56.362 region:rollup2
QUARTER NOW.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.763 region:rollup2
SO BUT I BELIEVE THE SUCCESS OF

00:24:56.362 --> 00:24:59.331 region:rollup2
THIS WORK

00:24:57.763 --> 00:25:00.599 region:rollup2
IS DUE IN PART TO THE

00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:02.234 region:rollup2
INTENTIONALITY OF THE

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:05.604 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE HAD.

00:25:02.234 --> 00:25:07.039 region:rollup2
TO WORK DIFFERENTLY TOGETHER.

00:25:05.604 --> 00:25:09.007 region:rollup2
NOW WE'VE HAD COLLABORATIVE AND

00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:10.542 region:rollup2
GRANT AWARDS FOR DECADES.

00:25:09.007 --> 00:25:12.444 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT IS IT DIFFERENT ABOUT

00:25:10.542 --> 00:25:13.879 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHAT WE TELL YOU WHAT IS

00:25:12.444 --> 00:25:15.247 region:rollup2
TO TRADITIONAL.

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:17.182 region:rollup2
USUALLY PARTNERS ARE GIVEN AN

00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:18.417 region:rollup2
AWARD EVEN IF YOU REQUIRE

00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:20.119 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION THERE GIVEN AN

00:25:18.417 --> 00:25:21.320 region:rollup2
AWARD. AND THEN EVERY PARTNER

00:25:20.119 --> 00:25:23.822 region:rollup2
GOES OFF

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.290 region:rollup2
PERFORMS ITS SERVICES PROVIDES

00:25:23.822 --> 00:25:27.025 region:rollup2
ITS IT SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:29.228 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE THEY'LL MEASURE IT AND

00:25:27.025 --> 00:25:29.762 region:rollup2
THEN PEOPLE OFTEN WORK THE SAME

00:25:29.228 --> 00:25:31.030 region:rollup2
AS IF THEY HAD NEVER BEEN

00:25:29.762 --> 00:25:33.632 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:36.301 region:rollup2
AND SO WE HAVE WHICH A TYPICALLY

00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:39.872 region:rollup2
HAVE IS PROVIDING INTERVENTIONS

00:25:36.301 --> 00:25:42.307 region:rollup2
THAT ONLY HAVE ISOLATED IMPACT.

00:25:39.872 --> 00:25:44.076 region:rollup2
OKAY AND AND WHAT WE HAVE REALLY

00:25:42.307 --> 00:25:46.412 region:rollup2
WORKED HARD TO DO.

00:25:44.076 --> 00:25:47.646 region:rollup2
IS CREATE COLLECTIVE IMPACT

00:25:46.412 --> 00:25:49.381 region:rollup2
AS AN ORGANIZATION OF THE

00:25:47.646 --> 00:25:51.083 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE TO PERFORM LARGE

00:25:49.381 --> 00:25:52.117 region:rollup2
SCALE.

00:25:51.083 --> 00:25:53.919 region:rollup2
SOCIAL CHANGE NOT TO PERFORM IT

00:25:52.117 --> 00:25:56.722 region:rollup2
TO ENABLE IT.

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:58.123 region:rollup2
OKAY. AND THE SEARCHING THROUGH

00:25:56.722 --> 00:26:00.325 region:rollup2
THE STRATEGIC COORDINATION OF

00:25:58.123 --> 00:26:01.994 region:rollup2
SERVICES. MUTUALLY REINFORCING

00:26:00.325 --> 00:26:03.762 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES

00:26:01.994 --> 00:26:04.730 region:rollup2
AND ALIGNMENT OF SOLUTIONS

00:26:03.762 --> 00:26:06.632 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN DUPLICATION OF

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.232 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS

00:26:06.632 --> 00:26:08.834 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ALL OF THESE

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:10.402 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE NOW PART

00:26:08.834 --> 00:26:12.271 region:rollup2
OF THIS WORK WE STARTED WITH TEN

00:31:55.013 --> 00:31:58.316 region:rollup2
COULD DO THIS.

00:31:56.915 --> 00:32:00.218 region:rollup2
BUT CREATING THE SMOOTH

00:31:58.316 --> 00:32:02.721 region:rollup2
TRANSITION PATHWAYS MAKE SHOW

00:32:00.218 --> 00:32:04.022 region:rollup2
THEM IT'S POSSIBLE.

00:32:02.721 --> 00:32:06.625 region:rollup2
AND I THINK I NEED TO CLOSE TO.

00:32:04.022 --> 00:32:07.526 region:rollup2
I'M DONE THERE'S MORE GO AHEAD

00:32:06.625 --> 00:32:08.927 region:rollup2
AND TAKE A LOOK AT HEALTH

00:32:07.526 --> 00:32:10.562 region:rollup2
EMPOWERMENT THIS IS A TO THE ONE

00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:11.963 region:rollup2
PART PART ABOUT THIS IS A TO

00:32:10.562 --> 00:32:12.964 region:rollup2
GENERATION APPROACH. YOU WE ARE

00:32:11.963 --> 00:32:14.866 region:rollup2
JUST WORKING WITH THE KIDS ARE

00:32:12.964 --> 00:32:16.234 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE FAMILIES AND

00:32:14.866 --> 00:32:17.669 region:rollup2
YOU'LL SEE ON THAT LAST NETWORK

00:32:16.234 --> 00:32:19.037 region:rollup2
THAT HOW MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:21.139 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL EDUCATION THE PARENTS

00:32:19.037 --> 00:32:21.640 region:rollup2
OF ALSO HAD SO THANK YOU VERY

DEAN. A SAY THAT KIND OF THING

00:32:40.659 --> 00:32:43.228 region:rollup2
AND FOR TALKING ABOUT RESULTS

00:32:41.827 --> 00:32:44.229 region:rollup2
BASS ACCOUNTABILITY HOW DO WE

00:32:43.228 --> 00:32:45.096 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT ANYBODY IS BETTER OFF

00:32:44.229 --> 00:32:46.631 region:rollup2
CAN WE PROVE IT.

00:32:45.096 --> 00:32:48.366 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE QUESTIONS IN JUST A

00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:50.135 region:rollup2

00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:21.266 region:rollup2
IN THE EARLY SERVE GRADES.

00:33:19.631 --> 00:33:22.467 region:rollup2
THE GOAL OF THE STANDARDS IS TO

00:33:21.266 --> 00:33:24.536 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT WE HAVE WELL

00:33:22.467 --> 00:33:25.537 region:rollup2
INFORMED CITIZENS TO PREPARE FOR

00:33:24.536 --> 00:33:26.972 region:rollup2
COLLEGE AND CAREERS AND

00:33:25.537 --> 00:33:28.573 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND APPRECIATE THE

00:33:26.972 --> 00:33:30.108 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC ENTERPRISE. THAT'S

00:33:28.573 --> 00:33:31.843 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY NOT BEEN THE CASE

00:33:30.108 --> 00:33:33.612 region:rollup2
IN OUR SCIENCE STANDARDS AND THE

00:33:31.843 --> 00:33:34.880 region:rollup2
PASTOR ST SCANNERS BEEN TAUGHT

00:33:33.612 --> 00:33:36.915 region:rollup2
AS A BODY OF KNOWLEDGE FOR

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.383 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO MASTER. AND THEN TO

00:33:36.915 --> 00:33:40.785 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO TRANSLATE THAT

00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:42.888 region:rollup2
MASTERY OF CONTENT BACK IN A WAY

00:33:40.785 --> 00:33:45.190 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN PRESCRIBED IT WITH

00:33:42.888 --> 00:33:46.291 region:rollup2
THE ONE ANSWER ONLY APPROACH.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:48.093 region:rollup2
THE INJUSTICE CALLS FOR

00:33:46.291 --> 00:33:49.561 region:rollup2
REFOCUSING QUE TWELVE SIGNS FOR

00:33:48.093 --> 00:33:51.363 region:rollup2
IMPROVED COLLEGE PREPARATION

SOCIETY TO MAKE INFORMED

00:33:53.498 --> 00:33:56.368 region:rollup2
DECISIONS.

00:33:55.033 --> 00:33:57.402 region:rollup2
TO ACCOMPLISH AS THE INJUSTICE

00:33:56.368 --> 00:33:58.603 region:rollup2
FOCUSES ON DEVELOPING THE

00:33:57.402 --> 00:33:59.771 region:rollup2
HABITANTS

00:33:58.603 --> 00:34:00.739 region:rollup2
SKILLS THAT SCIENTISTS AND

00:33:59.771 --> 00:34:02.107 region:rollup2
ENGINEERS USE IN THEIR DATED A

00:34:00.739 --> 00:34:03.441 region:rollup2
LIFE.

00:34:02.107 --> 00:34:05.243 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WILL SHIP FROM LEARNING

00:34:03.441 --> 00:34:06.544 region:rollup2
ABOUT SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING TO

00:34:05.243 --> 00:34:09.814 region:rollup2
FIGURE IT OUT AND MAKING SENSE

00:34:06.544 --> 00:34:11.016 region:rollup2
OF PHENOMENA AND LOCAL PROBLEMS.

00:34:09.814 --> 00:34:12.684 region:rollup2
THIS DEEPER FOCUS ON

00:34:11.016 --> 00:34:13.885 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING AND APPLICATION

00:34:12.684 --> 00:34:14.719 region:rollup2
REQUIRE NEW APPROACHES TO

00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:16.254 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL LEARNING FOR

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:17.789 region:rollup2
TEACHERS AND A RECOGNITION THAT

00:34:16.254 --> 00:34:19.891 region:rollup2
BECOMING AN EFFECTIVE SCIENCE

00:34:17.789 --> 00:34:21.459 region:rollup2
TEACHER OR STEM TEACHER IS A

00:34:19.891 --> 00:34:22.761 region:rollup2
CONTINUOUS PROCESS THAT.

00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:24.496 region:rollup2
STRETCHES FROM PRE SERVICE

00:34:22.761 --> 00:34:25.864 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES AN UNDERGRADUATE

00:34:24.496 --> 00:34:27.165 region:rollup2
YEARS TO END OF A PROFESSIONAL

00:34:25.864 --> 00:34:28.667 region:rollup2
CAREER.

00:34:27.165 --> 00:34:30.936 region:rollup2
I LIKE HIGHLIGHTS SEVERAL KEY

00:34:28.667 --> 00:34:33.204 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL LEARNING FEATURES

00:34:30.936 --> 00:34:35.240 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE NEEDED TO REALIZE.

00:34:33.204 --> 00:34:36.441 region:rollup2
STEM QUA HIGH QUALITY STEM

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.243 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS.

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:39.644 region:rollup2
AND TEACHERS.

00:34:38.243 --> 00:34:41.680 region:rollup2
ONE WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT.

00:34:39.644 --> 00:34:43.214 region:rollup2
TEACHERS ARE GOING TO MAKES

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:44.849 region:rollup2
NEED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT SHIFTS

00:34:43.214 --> 00:34:46.184 region:rollup2
IN THE WAY THAT CONTENT AND THE

00:34:44.849 --> 00:34:47.652 region:rollup2
MATTER THAT THEY DELIVER CONTENT

00:34:46.184 --> 00:34:49.354 region:rollup2
IN THEIR CLASSROOMS IF STUDENTS

00:34:47.652 --> 00:34:49.621 region:rollup2
ARE TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN

00:34:49.354 --> 00:34:51.723 region:rollup2
THESE TO.

00:34:49.621 --> 00:34:54.025 region:rollup2
NEW SET OF STANDARDS.

00:34:51.723 --> 00:34:55.961 region:rollup2
AND THAT SHIFT IT'S GOING TO

00:34:54.025 --> 00:34:57.362 region:rollup2
HELP THEM REQUIRE THEM TO THINK

00:34:55.961 --> 00:34:58.363 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT HOW THEY LEARN

00:34:57.362 --> 00:35:01.733 region:rollup2
SCIENCE ESPECIALLY IN THEIR

00:34:58.363 --> 00:35:03.001 region:rollup2
UNDERGRADUATE YEARS. TYPICALLY.

00:35:01.733 --> 00:35:05.403 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO DESIGN PROFESSIONAL

00:35:03.001 --> 00:35:06.705 region:rollup2
LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. THAT

00:35:05.403 --> 00:35:08.840 region:rollup2
ALLOW TEACHERS TO GRAPPLE WITH

00:35:06.705 --> 00:35:10.909 region:rollup2
BOTH THE SCIENCE OR STEM CONTENT

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.877 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS TO THINK ABOUT HOW

00:35:10.909 --> 00:35:14.245 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THINK AND LEARN ABOUT

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:16.214 region:rollup2
THE CONTENT AREA.

00:35:14.245 --> 00:35:17.515 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO ALSO A PROFESSIONAL

00:35:16.214 --> 00:35:19.050 region:rollup2
LEARNING THAT I INTRODUCES NEW

00:35:17.515 --> 00:35:21.119 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACHES THAT'S

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:22.721 region:rollup2
GROUNDED IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:24.356 region:rollup2
CONTENT WHETHER IT'S SCIENCE OR

00:35:22.721 --> 00:35:25.657 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING AMOUNT.

00:35:24.356 --> 00:35:26.925 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE THOSE AYE INSTRUCTIONAL

00:35:25.657 --> 00:35:28.893 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES BE DELIVERED IN

00:35:26.925 --> 00:35:30.495 region:rollup2
ISOLATION IT'S REALLY HARD FOR

00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:31.096 region:rollup2
TEACHERS TO MASTER THAT AND

00:35:30.495 --> 00:35:32.097 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT WHAT IS THAT MEAN

00:35:31.096 --> 00:35:32.597 region:rollup2
AND THE CONTENT.

00:35:32.097 --> 00:35:35.900 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR

00:35:32.597 --> 00:35:36.901 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.203 region:rollup2
LEARNING EXPERIENCES FOR

00:35:36.901 --> 00:35:39.337 region:rollup2
TEACHERS TO BE CLOBBERED IN

00:35:38.203 --> 00:35:40.939 region:rollup2
SUPPORT TEACHERS AND WORKING

00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:41.539 region:rollup2
TOGETHER TO UNDERSTAND APPLY AND

00:35:40.939 --> 00:35:42.941 region:rollup2
REFLECT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION

00:35:41.539 --> 00:35:44.809 region:rollup2
OF.

00:35:42.941 --> 00:35:46.277 region:rollup2
R. SCIENCE STANDARDS AS WELL AS

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:48.780 region:rollup2
OUR UP AND COMING NEW COMPUTER

00:35:46.277 --> 00:35:50.515 region:rollup2
SCIENCE STANDARDS.

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.917 region:rollup2
WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE A ONE

00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:54.653 region:rollup2
SIZE FITS DOZEN BURKE.

00:35:52.917 --> 00:35:56.287 region:rollup2
TEACHERS ARE UNIQUE ON THE HAVE

00:35:54.653 --> 00:35:57.789 region:rollup2
UNIQUE NEEDS AND TEACHERS IN

00:35:56.287 --> 00:35:59.824 region:rollup2
ELEMENTARY MIDDLE AND HIGH

00:35:57.789 --> 00:36:01.092 region:rollup2
SCHOOL HAVE. VERY UNIQUE NEEDS.

00:35:59.824 --> 00:36:02.193 region:rollup2
.

00:36:01.092 --> 00:36:03.595 region:rollup2
AS WE BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT

00:36:02.193 --> 00:36:04.963 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL LEARNING IT ALSO

00:36:03.595 --> 00:36:08.133 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE DESIGNED AS PART OF

00:36:04.963 --> 00:36:10.669 region:rollup2
A COHERENT SYSTEM OF SUPPORT.

00:36:08.133 --> 00:36:11.770 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY IN THINKING ABOUT.

00:36:10.669 --> 00:36:13.104 region:rollup2
SINCE RECORDS TALK THAT EARLY

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:14.539 region:rollup2
MATH INITIATIVE AN EARLY

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:15.607 region:rollup2
SCIENCES I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:17.609 region:rollup2
IT.

00:36:15.607 --> 00:36:18.443 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW THIS

00:36:17.609 --> 00:36:20.011 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO START IN THE EARLY

00:36:18.443 --> 00:36:22.013 region:rollup2
SAID GRADES.

00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:23.281 region:rollup2
AND OUR ELEMENTARY STUDENTS ARE

00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:24.616 region:rollup2
GIVEN INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES

00:36:23.281 --> 00:36:26.718 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR LITERACY

00:36:24.616 --> 00:36:29.454 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT.

00:36:26.718 --> 00:36:31.022 region:rollup2
THEN COMES ELT AND MOUTH. AND

00:36:29.454 --> 00:36:32.624 region:rollup2
OCCASIONALLY SCIENCE AND A

00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:34.359 region:rollup2
RECENT STUDY THAT WE DID ALAMEDA

00:36:32.624 --> 00:36:36.494 region:rollup2
COUNTY WE SERVER DISTRICTS

00:36:34.359 --> 00:36:36.961 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY. AND QUE TO TEACHERS

00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:39.397 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:40.298 region:rollup2
ABLE TO PROVIDE ON AVERAGE

00:36:39.397 --> 00:36:41.700 region:rollup2
THIRTY MINUTES OF SCIENCE

00:36:40.298 --> 00:36:43.468 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTION WEEKLY IF IT'S

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:45.203 region:rollup2
OCCURRING AT ALL. AND UP TO

00:36:43.468 --> 00:36:46.905 region:rollup2
FORTY FIVE MINUTES IF IT'S IN

00:36:45.203 --> 00:36:48.373 region:rollup2
THE THREE THREE FIVE.

00:36:46.905 --> 00:36:49.507 region:rollup2
WE SEE A HIGHER NUMBER MINUTES

00:36:48.373 --> 00:36:51.042 region:rollup2
OF COURSE IN FOURTH AND FIFTH

00:36:49.507 --> 00:36:52.510 region:rollup2
GRADE BECAUSE HISTORICALLY

00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:54.779 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT OUR SCIENCE

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:55.880 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT HAS TESTED.

00:36:54.779 --> 00:36:57.782 region:rollup2
TEACHERS REPORT THAT THERE ARE

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.084 region:rollup2
NOT PERMITTED AT TIMES TO TEACH

00:36:57.782 --> 00:37:01.319 region:rollup2
SCIENCE THAT THEY NEED TO FOCUS

00:36:59.084 --> 00:37:02.720 region:rollup2
ON THE LITERACY. BUSINESS OUT OF

00:37:01.319 --> 00:37:03.955 region:rollup2
SCIENCE STANDARDS ARGUE THAT WE

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:05.690 region:rollup2
DEVELOP LITERATE STUDENTS

00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:07.592 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE CONTEXT OF SCIENCE

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:08.860 region:rollup2
MATH APPLICATION. AS CAROLYN

00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:10.695 region:rollup2
MENTIONED ARE CAN ALSO MENTIONED

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:13.164 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE GREAT WAY FOR

00:37:10.695 --> 00:37:14.632 region:rollup2
LITERACY TO DEVELOP.

00:37:13.164 --> 00:37:16.267 region:rollup2
FOR OUR SCHOOLS BOTH THE NUMBER

00:37:14.632 --> 00:37:17.669 region:rollup2
AND AGREE A CHANGES REQUIRED TO

00:37:16.267 --> 00:37:19.537 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT THESE NEW STANDARDS IS

00:37:17.669 --> 00:37:21.206 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT.

00:37:19.537 --> 00:37:22.307 region:rollup2
A CONSIDERABLE PREPARATION TIME

00:37:21.206 --> 00:37:24.042 region:rollup2
IS NEEDED BEFORE AND AFTER

00:37:22.307 --> 00:37:25.477 region:rollup2
FORMALLY ADOPTION FOR BOTH SIDES

00:37:24.042 --> 00:37:26.911 region:rollup2
EDUCATOR IN SCHOOL LEADERS

00:37:25.477 --> 00:37:27.912 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE SHIPS TO

00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:29.614 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN PROFESSIONAL

00:37:27.912 --> 00:37:31.616 region:rollup2
LEARNING.

00:37:29.614 --> 00:37:32.984 region:rollup2
PILOT WORK CONTINUES SHE CHANGES

00:37:31.616 --> 00:37:34.452 region:rollup2
MOST DISTRICTS RECOGNIZE THAT

00:37:32.984 --> 00:37:35.386 region:rollup2
THEY NEED PARTNERS

00:37:34.452 --> 00:37:37.589 region:rollup2
TO INITIATE AND SUSTAIN THIS

00:37:35.386 --> 00:37:38.656 region:rollup2
WORK.

00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:40.158 region:rollup2
MANY PROGRAMS AND STRUCTURES IN

00:37:38.656 --> 00:37:42.093 region:rollup2
THE STATE STRUGGLE WITH

00:37:40.158 --> 00:37:43.361 region:rollup2
INCONSISTENT FUNDING THOUGH. ON

00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:44.762 region:rollup2
YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE AWARE THAT

00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:46.231 region:rollup2
OUR CALIFORNIA MATH SCIENCE

00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:47.932 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP GRANT THAT REALLY

00:37:46.231 --> 00:37:49.234 region:rollup2
FUNDED AND SUSTAINED A LOT OF

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:51.703 region:rollup2
WORK ACROSS THE STATE.

00:37:49.234 --> 00:37:54.172 region:rollup2
OR NONEXISTENT THIS COMING YEAR

00:37:51.703 --> 00:37:55.373 region:rollup2
AND SO THE EXPERTISE AND THE

00:37:54.172 --> 00:37:57.675 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES THAT EXISTED THERE

00:37:55.373 --> 00:37:58.910 region:rollup2
HAVE GONE AWAY AND DISTRICTS ARE

00:37:57.675 --> 00:37:59.944 region:rollup2
LEFT GRAPPLING WITH THESE.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:02.447 region:rollup2
THESE VERY COMPLEX SET OF NEW

00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:03.748 region:rollup2
STANDARDS.

00:38:02.447 --> 00:38:04.816 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT ONE MODEL

00:38:03.748 --> 00:38:06.084 region:rollup2
THOUGH THAT'S BEEN SUPPORTING

00:38:04.816 --> 00:38:07.986 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL LEARNING NEEDS US

00:38:06.084 --> 00:38:09.954 region:rollup2
HAS A GREAT SUCCESS.

00:38:07.986 --> 00:38:10.889 region:rollup2
AS MENTIONED EARLIER.

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:12.056 region:rollup2
I'M AT ALAMEDA COUNTY OFFICE

00:38:10.889 --> 00:38:12.791 region:rollup2
SAID BUT I'M ALSO A CAL STATE

00:38:12.056 --> 00:38:13.892 region:rollup2

AT THE COUNTY OFFICE.

00:38:33.211 --> 00:38:36.314 region:rollup2
WORKING COLLECTIVELY TOGETHER WE

00:38:34.879 --> 00:38:38.483 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WRITE.

00:38:36.314 --> 00:38:40.618 region:rollup2
FOR FUNDING AND.

GRANT.

00:38:43.154 --> 00:38:46.224 region:rollup2
ONE OF OUR BIGGEST FUNDING.

00:38:44.656 --> 00:38:47.759 region:rollup2
WAS INTERPRETED MIDDLE SCHOOL

00:38:46.224 --> 00:38:49.561 region:rollup2
SCIENCE FOTOS AND US HAVE FUNDED

00:38:47.759 --> 00:38:50.461 region:rollup2
WAS TARGETING STUDENTS AND

00:38:49.561 --> 00:38:51.596 region:rollup2
TEACHERS THAT ARE OF

00:38:50.461 --> 00:38:53.464 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY BEEN

00:38:51.596 --> 00:38:55.099 region:rollup2
UNDERREPRESENTED IN STEM. AND

00:38:53.464 --> 00:38:57.168 region:rollup2
ELEVEN OF OUR DISTRICTS IN THE

00:38:55.099 --> 00:38:58.469 region:rollup2
SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. THE

00:38:57.168 --> 00:38:59.971 region:rollup2
RESULTS FROM THAT.

00:38:58.469 --> 00:39:02.841 region:rollup2
WORK I'VE BEEN PRETTY

00:38:59.971 --> 00:39:04.642 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL RECEIVED ON TEACHER

00:39:02.841 --> 00:39:06.144 region:rollup2
AND STUDENT CONTENT GAINES AS

00:39:04.642 --> 00:39:07.512 region:rollup2
MEASURED ON PRE AND POST.

00:39:06.144 --> 00:39:08.646 region:rollup2
WE SEE THAT TEACHERS ARE UP

00:39:07.512 --> 00:39:10.248 region:rollup2
TAKING NEW INSTRUCTIONAL

00:39:08.646 --> 00:39:11.049 region:rollup2
PRACTICES AND STUDENTS ARE

00:39:10.248 --> 00:39:12.417 region:rollup2
REPORTING.

00:39:11.049 --> 00:39:13.718 region:rollup2
A GREATER.

00:39:12.417 --> 00:39:15.086 region:rollup2
IDENTITY OF SCIENCE AND MORE

00:39:13.718 --> 00:39:16.921 region:rollup2
EFFICACY.

00:39:15.086 --> 00:39:18.723 region:rollup2
WE ALSO SEE A SHIFT IN AND AND

00:39:16.921 --> 00:39:20.391 region:rollup2
FACULTY PRACTICES AS OUR

00:39:18.723 --> 00:39:21.092 region:rollup2
FACULTIES ENGAGE IN THIS

00:39:20.391 --> 00:39:23.328 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE OF PRACTICE WITH

00:39:21.092 --> 00:39:24.529 region:rollup2
TEACHERS. AND WITH ON THE

00:39:23.328 --> 00:39:25.863 region:rollup2
PETITIONS THAT THE COUNTY OFFICE

00:39:24.529 --> 00:39:27.432 region:rollup2
THEY BEGIN TO THINK AND REFLECT

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:27.966 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT THEIR UNDERGRADUATE

00:39:27.432 --> 00:39:32.337 region:rollup2
STUDENTS NEEDS IN ORDER TO

00:39:27.966 --> 00:39:32.570 region:rollup2
LEARN.

00:39:32.337 --> 00:39:33.538 region:rollup2
A NEW.

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:35.373 region:rollup2
GRANT.

00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:37.208 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO

00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:38.343 region:rollup2
USE WE HUNDREDS SESSION FROM

00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:39.878 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL AND MIDDLE SCHOOL

00:39:38.343 --> 00:39:42.046 region:rollup2
AND ELEMENTARY RECOGNIZING THAT

00:39:39.878 --> 00:39:43.348 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THE GREATER NEED AND SO

00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:45.016 region:rollup2
WE HAD CALIFORNIA MUST P. WHICH

00:39:43.348 --> 00:39:46.451 region:rollup2
WAS FOCUSING ON TEACHERS IN

00:39:45.016 --> 00:39:47.752 region:rollup2
GRADES THREE THROUGH FIVE.

00:39:46.451 --> 00:39:49.254 region:rollup2
AND MEASURED BY THE EXTERNAL

00:39:47.752 --> 00:39:50.455 region:rollup2
EVALUATION BECAUSE OF OUR

00:39:49.254 --> 00:39:52.023 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL

00:39:50.455 --> 00:39:53.491 region:rollup2
WE HAD THE SECOND HIGHEST COURT

00:39:52.023 --> 00:39:55.026 region:rollup2
OF CONTENT CANYON FOR TEACHERS

00:39:53.491 --> 00:39:57.996 region:rollup2
AND NEW PRACTICES ACROSS THE

00:39:55.026 --> 00:39:59.063 region:rollup2
STATE. IN JUST TWO YEARS WHAT'S

00:39:57.996 --> 00:40:01.366 region:rollup2
UNIQUE ABOUT THIS PROFESSIONAL

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:03.635 region:rollup2
DEFAULT MODEL IS IS NOT JUST

00:40:01.366 --> 00:40:04.502 region:rollup2
CONTENT DELIVERY FOR TEACHERS.

00:40:03.635 --> 00:40:06.070 region:rollup2
IT'S CONTENT WITH NEW

00:40:04.502 --> 00:40:07.472 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES THAT

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:09.207 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE CONTENT.

00:40:07.472 --> 00:40:10.708 region:rollup2
WITH INTENSIVE FOLLOW UP DURING

00:40:09.207 --> 00:40:12.644 region:rollup2
THE ACADEMIC YEAR WERE TEACHERS

00:40:10.708 --> 00:40:13.978 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN LESSON STUDY WHICH IS

00:40:12.644 --> 00:40:16.648 region:rollup2
A CYCLE OF INQUIRY.

00:40:13.978 --> 00:40:18.149 region:rollup2
AND ADMINISTRATIVE DEVELOPMENT.

00:40:16.648 --> 00:40:19.250 region:rollup2
WE BRING TOGETHER LEADERS AT THE

00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:20.551 region:rollup2
DISTRICT INSIGHT LEVEL WITH

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:22.820 region:rollup2
THESE TEACHER LEADERS THINK

00:40:20.551 --> 00:40:24.355 region:rollup2
ABOUT TRANSFORMATIONAL PRACTICES

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:25.356 region:rollup2
THAT ARE REALLY GOING TO MAKE

00:40:24.355 --> 00:40:27.859 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES IN THE WAY THAT

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:29.961 region:rollup2
SCIENCE HAS TALKED.

00:40:27.859 --> 00:40:31.396 region:rollup2
ON.

00:40:29.961 --> 00:40:32.730 region:rollup2
THERE'S ANOTHER.

00:40:31.396 --> 00:40:34.198 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT'S HAPPENING AT THE

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:35.199 region:rollup2
COUNTY OFFICE AND I'D LIKE TO

00:40:34.198 --> 00:40:36.267 region:rollup2
JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT AND ONE OF

00:40:35.199 --> 00:40:38.002 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUES IS COMPATIBLE BUT

00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:39.003 region:rollup2
MORE IN DETAIL.

00:40:38.002 --> 00:40:40.305 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE ALIGNMENT BAY

00:40:39.003 --> 00:40:41.906 region:rollup2
AREA THE ALIGNMENT VERY SICK

00:40:40.305 --> 00:40:43.007 region:rollup2
CLOBBERED OF IMPACT INITIATIVE

00:42:31.716 --> 00:42:36.754 region:rollup2
WORK A LOT OF THE CSU CAMPUSES

00:42:34.752 --> 00:42:37.288 region:rollup2
ARE DOING REALLY INNOVATIVE

00:42:36.754 --> 00:42:39.557 region:rollup2
VALUABLE WORK IN THIS VERY

00:42:37.288 --> 00:42:42.393 region:rollup2
FIELD.

00:42:39.557 --> 00:42:44.162 region:rollup2
SO TO AND THEN.

00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:46.330 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS YOU

00:42:44.162 --> 00:42:46.697 region:rollup2
KNOW SHORT CHANGING BUTTON

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:49.734 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY BUT.

00:42:46.697 --> 00:42:51.769 region:rollup2
DIDN'T TAKE ANYWAY SUPPORTING

00:42:49.734 --> 00:42:53.905 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING THE CAL STATE

00:42:51.769 --> 00:42:55.406 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM PARTICULARLY

00:42:53.905 --> 00:42:56.874 region:rollup2
FURTHER VALUE IN TRAINING

00:42:55.406 --> 00:42:59.844 region:rollup2
TEACHERS.

00:42:56.874 --> 00:43:02.113 region:rollup2
WOULD BE AN ENORMOUS STRUCTURAL

00:42:59.844 --> 00:43:04.782 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT IN EDUCATION IN ALL

00:43:02.113 --> 00:43:07.251 region:rollup2
FIELDS BUT PARTICULARLY STEM.

00:43:04.782 --> 00:43:09.086 region:rollup2
THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD JUST

00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:10.054 region:rollup2
MAKE WHENEVER THEY WANTED TO.

00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:11.823 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S AN ACCURATE IN

00:43:10.054 --> 00:43:13.925 region:rollup2
RIGHTEOUS SHAMELESS PLUG UP AND

00:43:11.823 --> 00:43:16.427 region:rollup2
RIGHT ON TIME THAT. IT'S TRUE.

00:43:13.925 --> 00:43:16.961 region:rollup2
WE HAVE GREAT INSTITUTIONS OF

00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:17.895 region:rollup2
HIGHER LEARNING THAT NEED

00:43:16.961 --> 00:43:20.598 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT.

00:43:17.895 --> 00:43:22.300 region:rollup2
IN IN THE CSU SYSTEM. AYE IN

00:43:20.598 --> 00:43:24.368 region:rollup2
THE UC SYSTEM AND I COMMITTEE

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:26.838 region:rollup2
COSTUMES ARE ALL FANTASTIC. ARE

00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:28.272 region:rollup2
CLEARLY TODAY'S PANEL IS A A

00:43:26.838 --> 00:43:29.507 region:rollup2
TESTAMENT TO CAL STATE EAST BAY

00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:31.642 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THAT INVESTMENT HAS

00:43:29.507 --> 00:43:32.844 region:rollup2
BEEN MEANT. AND I SURE HOPE THAT

00:43:31.642 --> 00:43:34.111 region:rollup2
THE ENROLLMENT JUST SHOT UP IN

00:43:32.844 --> 00:43:35.313 region:rollup2
THIS WAS A GREAT COMMERCIAL CAO

00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:36.681 region:rollup2
YEAH.

00:43:35.313 --> 00:43:39.317 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU ALL DO

00:43:36.681 --> 00:43:39.717 region:rollup2
I'M I WANT YOU THE QUESTIONS BY

COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

00:43:39.717 --> 00:43:42.753 region:rollup2
.

00:43:41.252 --> 00:43:44.489 region:rollup2
TERROR SAW CHAU SPEAKING OF CAL

00:43:42.753 --> 00:43:45.389 region:rollup2
STATE EAST BAY.

00:43:44.489 --> 00:43:47.391 region:rollup2
I'M JUST WONDERING.

00:43:45.389 --> 00:43:49.861 region:rollup2
IF THERE IS ARE YOU UNDER

00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:51.362 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN IN STEM

00:43:49.861 --> 00:43:53.231 region:rollup2
AT THE ACCOUNTS THAT YOU SPACE.

00:43:51.362 --> 00:43:54.732 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HISTORICALLY WOMEN HAVE

00:43:53.231 --> 00:43:56.734 region:rollup2
ALWAYS BEEN ON THE REPRESENTED

00:43:54.732 --> 00:43:59.570 region:rollup2
IN COMPUTER SCIENCE THEM WHAT'S

00:43:56.734 --> 00:44:02.340 region:rollup2
UP STEAM AYE EDUCATION SO AND IF

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:04.509 region:rollup2
SO ARE WAY DOWN HOW DO WE

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:06.244 region:rollup2
RECTIFY THAT SITUATION. OF FOR

AND ALSO THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

00:44:11.015 --> 00:44:14.886 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU SHOULD.

00:44:13.584 --> 00:44:16.420 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT WE'RE VERY DIVERSE WE

00:44:14.886 --> 00:44:18.289 region:rollup2
HAVE ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT WOMEN

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:19.624 region:rollup2
IN IN THE UNIVERSITY AND WE HAVE

00:44:18.289 --> 00:44:21.626 region:rollup2
GOOD REPRESENTATION IN THE

00:44:19.624 --> 00:44:23.528 region:rollup2
SCIENCES WE ARE HIRING WOMEN

00:44:21.626 --> 00:44:24.595 region:rollup2
INTO THE FIELDS WE. IN OUR

00:44:23.528 --> 00:44:26.330 region:rollup2
PHYSICS DEPARTMENT THE LAST

00:44:24.595 --> 00:44:28.499 region:rollup2
THREE HOW FOR HIRES THREE HAVE

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:30.434 region:rollup2
BEEN WOMEN TO MINORITIES AND SO

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:31.702 region:rollup2
WE'RE REALLY WORKING VERY HARD

00:44:30.434 --> 00:44:33.404 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF DIVERSIFYING OUR

00:44:31.702 --> 00:44:34.939 region:rollup2
FACULTY. AND MAKING SURE THAT

00:44:33.404 --> 00:44:36.474 region:rollup2
THEY CAN REPRESENT.

00:44:34.939 --> 00:44:38.442 region:rollup2
THE FACES OF OUR STUDENTS AS

00:44:36.474 --> 00:44:40.144 region:rollup2
WELL AND THEN TO REALLY WORK

00:44:38.442 --> 00:44:41.412 region:rollup2
TOWARDS THEIR GRADUATION AND SO

00:44:40.144 --> 00:44:42.947 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING A LOT OF EFFORTS IN

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:44.782 region:rollup2
TERMS OF TRYING TO. ENCOURAGE

00:44:42.947 --> 00:44:46.417 region:rollup2
PEOPLE INTO THE FIELDS.

00:44:44.782 --> 00:44:48.286 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE STARTING AT THE SCHOOLS

00:44:46.417 --> 00:44:50.621 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND TEACHING THEM IN

00:44:48.286 --> 00:44:52.056 region:rollup2
THROUGH. THE SCIENCE DAYS AND

00:44:50.621 --> 00:44:53.824 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE THAT THAT BAYER AND

00:44:52.056 --> 00:44:54.926 region:rollup2
OTHERS HAVE HELP TO SUPPORT WE

00:44:53.824 --> 00:44:56.127 region:rollup2
ARE GETTING MORE PEOPLE

00:44:54.926 --> 00:44:57.495 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN THE FIELDS AND

00:44:56.127 --> 00:44:59.130 region:rollup2
LEARN EATEN THEM KNOWING ABOUT

00:44:57.495 --> 00:45:00.264 region:rollup2
IT. SO IT'S REALLY BUILDING THAT

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:02.900 region:rollup2
PIPELINE IN THERE ONCE THEY'RE

00:45:00.264 --> 00:45:02.900 region:rollup2
WITH US TRIED PROVIDE SERVICES

00:45:02.967 --> 00:45:06.938 region:rollup2
SUCCEED.

THANK YOU.

00:45:06.938 --> 00:45:11.175 region:rollup2
LIQUIDATED CLAD ONES ONTO IT

00:45:09.307 --> 00:45:12.343 region:rollup2
YEAH ONE OF THE THINGS TO LEARN

00:45:11.175 --> 00:45:14.745 region:rollup2
THAT WE THINK BROADLY ABOUT IS

00:45:12.343 --> 00:45:16.213 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE AN IDENTITY

00:45:14.745 --> 00:45:18.015 region:rollup2
AS A SCIENCE CAPABLE PERSON.

00:45:16.213 --> 00:45:19.250 region:rollup2
MULLIN TALK WITH EDUCATORS OFTEN

00:45:18.015 --> 00:45:21.285 region:rollup2
WILL SEE THESE AMAZING STUDENTS

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:21.819 region:rollup2
BOTH MALE AND FEMALES THAT COME

00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:23.187 region:rollup2
THERE ARE CLASS.

00:45:21.819 --> 00:45:24.855 region:rollup2
RARELY DO WE RECOGNIZE AND SAY

00:45:23.187 --> 00:45:26.958 region:rollup2
THAT YOU MAKE A GREAT EDUCATOR A

00:45:24.855 --> 00:45:28.292 region:rollup2
SCIENCE EDUCATOR WILL SAY THAT

00:45:26.958 --> 00:45:29.994 region:rollup2
YOU'LL MAKE A GREAT SCIENTISTS

00:45:28.292 --> 00:45:31.562 region:rollup2
MIGHT MAKE A GREAT ENGINEER.

00:45:29.994 --> 00:45:33.264 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT IS TEACHERS

00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:36.601 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT THEIR IDENTITIES

00:45:33.264 --> 00:45:36.601 region:rollup2
SPECIAL OUR ELEMENTARY WHICH HAS

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:39.604 region:rollup2
TEACHERS.

00:45:38.302 --> 00:45:41.572 region:rollup2
AS THEIR IDENTITY IS SCIENCE

00:45:39.604 --> 00:45:43.207 region:rollup2
CAPABLE AND THAT THEY CREATE

00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:44.675 region:rollup2
ROBUST LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES

00:45:43.207 --> 00:45:46.444 region:rollup2
FOR STUDENTS AND THEN ME AND

00:45:44.675 --> 00:45:47.712 region:rollup2
FEMALE STUDENTS IN THOSE GRADES

00:45:46.444 --> 00:45:49.547 region:rollup2
FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG IN THOSE

00:45:47.712 --> 00:45:50.815 region:rollup2
COURSES AND SUPPORTED. IN

00:45:49.547 --> 00:45:52.249 region:rollup2
ENGAGING AND SINCE MAKING AND

00:45:50.815 --> 00:45:53.484 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR IDEAS COUNT THEM WE

00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:55.853 region:rollup2
WILL SEE MORE STUDENTS INTO

00:45:53.484 --> 00:45:56.420 region:rollup2
READING COLLEGE PREPARED AND

00:45:55.853 --> 00:46:00.324 region:rollup2
FEEL LIKE THAT'S A PLACE TO

00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:01.459 region:rollup2
BELONG.

00:46:00.324 --> 00:46:02.660 region:rollup2
I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE

00:46:01.459 --> 00:46:03.427 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION THAT WE STARTED

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:05.730 region:rollup2
WITH ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:07.331 region:rollup2
MATH AND EARLY LEARNING AND MATH

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:08.833 region:rollup2
LITERACY AND MISS OFFENDER WHEN

00:46:07.331 --> 00:46:09.767 region:rollup2
YOU TALKED ABOUT MATH FUN I HAVE

00:46:08.833 --> 00:46:11.769 region:rollup2
TO ADMIT.

00:46:09.767 --> 00:46:13.804 region:rollup2
I HAD FLASHBACKS

00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:16.374 region:rollup2
TO SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH MY

00:46:13.804 --> 00:46:17.875 region:rollup2
YOUNGEST THAT. I THINK GRUELING

00:46:16.374 --> 00:46:18.676 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

00:46:17.875 --> 00:46:20.344 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S JUST ME A LOT OF

00:46:18.676 --> 00:46:22.013 region:rollup2
CRYING.

00:46:20.344 --> 00:46:24.181 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET

00:46:22.013 --> 00:46:26.584 region:rollup2
TO HER MATH PACKET CLOWN CAN THE

00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:28.886 region:rollup2
YOU TALKED ABOUT MATH LITERACY.

00:46:26.584 --> 00:46:30.287 region:rollup2
A KINDERGARTEN.

00:46:28.886 --> 00:46:31.322 region:rollup2
IT INTO THAT MEAN BY.

00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:32.990 region:rollup2
TIME THE STUDENT STARTS

00:46:31.322 --> 00:46:33.524 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN OR BY THE TIME

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:34.191 region:rollup2
THEY'VE COMPLETED CAN THE

00:46:33.524 --> 00:46:36.060 region:rollup2
GARDEN.

00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:37.762 region:rollup2
AND WHAT COMPONENTS ARE REALLY

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:38.329 region:rollup2
ADVOCATING I KNOW THAT SO MUCH

00:46:37.762 --> 00:46:40.164 region:rollup2
OF LITERATURE TALKS ABOUT.

00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:42.967 region:rollup2
.

00:46:40.164 --> 00:46:44.335 region:rollup2
OR LITERACY IN GENERAL AND USING

00:46:42.967 --> 00:46:46.170 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN IS A TIME TO REALLY

00:46:44.335 --> 00:46:48.172 region:rollup2
SOCIALIZE STUDENTS TO SCHOOL AND

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:48.773 region:rollup2
NOT OVERWHELMING THEM. OR

00:46:48.172 --> 00:46:49.807 region:rollup2
INTIMIDATING THEM WHAT ARE WE

00:46:48.773 --> 00:46:51.809 region:rollup2
ASKING.

00:46:49.807 --> 00:46:52.743 region:rollup2
OUR STUDENTS TO KNOW AND LEARN.

00:46:51.809 --> 00:46:56.047 region:rollup2
BY KINDERGARTEN AS RELATES TO

00:46:52.743 --> 00:46:57.682 region:rollup2
MATHEMATICS.

00:46:56.047 --> 00:46:59.917 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SOME OF MY CONTENT

00:46:57.682 --> 00:47:03.187 region:rollup2
EXPERTS TO BACK ME UP ON THIS.

00:46:59.917 --> 00:47:04.989 region:rollup2
IT'S EASIER THAN I THOUGHT

00:47:03.187 --> 00:47:07.658 region:rollup2
BEFORE I STARTED UNDERSTANDING

00:47:04.989 --> 00:47:10.227 region:rollup2
THE STUFF I IT'S NOT.

00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:12.063 region:rollup2
PRE ALGEBRA BY AGE THREE OR

00:47:10.227 --> 00:47:13.531 region:rollup2
ANYTHING LIKE THAT THEIR

00:47:12.063 --> 00:47:15.566 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL MATH YEAR

00:47:13.531 --> 00:47:18.069 region:rollup2
INTELLECTUAL CONCEPTS THAT COME

00:47:15.566 --> 00:47:22.940 region:rollup2
WITH MATH THINGS LIKE GROUPING.

00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:24.809 region:rollup2
AND. PARA RANCIC'S EDUCATION WHO

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:27.211 region:rollup2
HAVE TIES SUBITO ICING.

00:47:24.809 --> 00:47:27.411 region:rollup2
ANYBODY KNOW IT SUMA TYSON MEANS

00:47:27.211 --> 00:47:28.612 region:rollup2
ZERO.

00:47:27.411 --> 00:47:29.313 region:rollup2
YOU ARE.

00:47:28.612 --> 00:47:29.847 region:rollup2
PLAYING A BOARD GAME.

00:47:29.313 --> 00:47:30.548 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT.

00:47:29.847 --> 00:47:31.382 region:rollup2
THAT DIETING

00:47:30.548 --> 00:47:32.083 region:rollup2
ROLL

00:47:31.382 --> 00:47:33.584 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT HOW MANY

00:47:32.083 --> 00:47:36.020 region:rollup2
SPEAKING.

00:47:33.584 --> 00:47:37.088 region:rollup2
THAT ACTUALLY.

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:40.391 region:rollup2
DIE.

00:47:37.088 --> 00:47:42.360 region:rollup2
THERE ARE.

00:47:40.391 --> 00:47:43.294 region:rollup2
SO THERE SYMPATHETIC.

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.563 region:rollup2
KIDS CAN LEARN THROUGH

00:47:43.294 --> 00:47:46.197 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES.

00:47:45.563 --> 00:47:46.897 region:rollup2
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THERE

00:47:46.197 --> 00:47:47.865 region:rollup2
SIMPLY.

00:47:46.897 --> 00:47:48.899 region:rollup2
HAVING A.

00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:50.334 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT HAPPY

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:51.068 region:rollup2
BENEFITS

00:47:50.334 --> 00:47:52.303 region:rollup2
COUNTING THEIR NOT HAVING

00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:52.937 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES

00:47:52.303 --> 00:47:55.039 region:rollup2
PLAYING GAMES THEY'RE NOT HAVING

00:47:52.937 --> 00:47:57.041 region:rollup2
USED.

00:47:55.039 --> 00:47:58.743 region:rollup2
WITH OUR GROUP BEING AND HAVING

00:47:57.041 --> 00:47:59.343 region:rollup2
THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH ADULTS

00:47:58.743 --> 00:48:01.278 region:rollup2
IN THEIR LIVES THAT ALLOW THEM

00:47:59.343 --> 00:48:02.880 region:rollup2
TO.

00:48:01.278 --> 00:48:05.015 region:rollup2
SO SAY POINTING OUT OF THE BLUE

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:06.951 region:rollup2
THINGS IN HER ROOM OR A LOT OF

00:48:05.015 --> 00:48:08.586 region:rollup2
LITTLE KIDSTHEY CAN COUNT TO

00:48:06.951 --> 00:48:11.489 region:rollup2
THREE. AND THEN THERE'S

00:48:08.586 --> 00:48:13.257 region:rollup2
SOMETHING HARD ABOUT FOUR AND

00:48:11.489 --> 00:48:14.625 region:rollup2
HARD ABOUT GETTING INTO YOUR ARE

00:48:13.257 --> 00:48:16.227 region:rollup2
THE TO YOUR OTHER HAND AND

00:48:14.625 --> 00:48:18.996 region:rollup2
LEARNING SIX THIS IS THAT YOU

00:48:16.227 --> 00:48:20.631 region:rollup2
KNOW VERY YOUNG AGES. SO IF

00:48:18.996 --> 00:48:24.401 region:rollup2
PARENTS ARE KIND OF AWARE OF HIS

00:48:20.631 --> 00:48:26.170 region:rollup2
STUFF IT'S VERY EASY TO DO AND

00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:28.439 region:rollup2
THEN THE STUDENTS YOU KNOW THEN

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:30.274 region:rollup2
THEY CAN GROUP AND PATTERN AND

00:48:28.439 --> 00:48:32.309 region:rollup2
DO ALL THAT STUFF. THAT BUILDS

00:48:30.274 --> 00:48:35.379 region:rollup2
LATER WHEN THEY WHEN THEY GO AND

00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:36.013 region:rollup2
SUMA TIES. SYMPATHIZING.

00:48:35.379 --> 00:48:37.181 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING ON MY FACEBOOK RIGHT

00:48:36.013 --> 00:48:38.616 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:48:37.181 --> 00:48:39.316 region:rollup2
HOW HOW DO WE HOW DO WE

00:48:38.616 --> 00:48:41.752 region:rollup2
SYMPATHIZE?

00:48:39.316 --> 00:48:43.220 region:rollup2
AFTER WAS INTERPRETED YEAH YEAH

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:44.889 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTOOD THAT WE COULD DO

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:46.123 region:rollup2
THAT BUT NO UNTIL I HEARD YOU

00:48:44.889 --> 00:48:47.491 region:rollup2
DESCRIBE IT I'VE NEVER HEARD THE

00:48:46.123 --> 00:48:48.893 region:rollup2
PHRASE.

00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:50.060 region:rollup2
I GUESS MY QUESTION RELATES TO

00:48:48.893 --> 00:48:51.862 region:rollup2
THE LAST THING THAT YOU SAID

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:53.264 region:rollup2
THAT PARENTS WHEN THEY KNOW. HOW

00:48:51.862 --> 00:48:55.266 region:rollup2
DO WE PACKAGE THIS IN WAYS THAT

00:48:53.264 --> 00:48:56.834 region:rollup2
PARENTS CAN SUE THE TIES WITH

00:48:55.266 --> 00:48:58.235 region:rollup2
THEIR KIDS THAT THEY CAN DO

00:48:56.834 --> 00:49:00.237 region:rollup2
GROUPING? IN WAYS THAT DON'T AN

00:48:58.235 --> 00:49:02.306 region:rollup2
INTIMIDATE THEM OR CALL ON THEIR

00:49:00.237 --> 00:49:03.240 region:rollup2
OWN EXPERIENCES IT MIGHT HAVE

00:49:02.306 --> 00:49:05.543 region:rollup2
BEEN NEGATIVE.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:07.344 region:rollup2
ALLEGEDLY YEAH.

00:49:05.543 --> 00:49:08.779 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE HELP PARENTS TO DO

00:49:07.344 --> 00:49:10.014 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:11.949 region:rollup2
ABOUT HERE TODAY?

00:49:10.014 --> 00:49:13.417 region:rollup2
I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT TODAY AND

00:49:11.949 --> 00:49:15.586 region:rollup2
I'D BE HAPPY TO SEND THAT WE'VE

00:49:13.417 --> 00:49:17.688 region:rollup2
DONE A FLYER DATES IN THREE

00:49:15.586 --> 00:49:20.191 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ENCOURAGING

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:21.826 region:rollup2
PARENTS TO DO THAT. AND IT'S

00:49:20.191 --> 00:49:23.461 region:rollup2
INTENDED IT HAS IT'S STILL IN

00:49:21.826 --> 00:49:24.628 region:rollup2
ITS EARLY STAGES BUT WE'RE

00:49:23.461 --> 00:49:27.231 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE ECONOMIC

00:49:24.628 --> 00:49:29.600 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT ALLIANCE AYE. IT'S

00:49:27.231 --> 00:49:31.669 region:rollup2
TO BE DISTRIBUTED AT PEDIATRICS

OFFICES AND PRESCHOOLS AND

00:49:31.669 --> 00:49:36.674 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE THAT TO SHOW HOW

00:49:33.871 --> 00:49:38.309 region:rollup2
SIMPLE AND FIND IT CAN BE AND

00:49:36.674 --> 00:49:40.311 region:rollup2
THEN TO LINK TO RESOURCES THAT

00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:41.979 region:rollup2
YOU CAN GO ON AND YOU KNOW IF

THAT INVOLVES TEACHING.

00:49:49.687 --> 00:49:53.424 region:rollup2
ADULTS

00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:55.226 region:rollup2
NOT TO BE AFRAID OF MATH ME NOT

WE'RE DOING THAT. I.

00:50:04.802 --> 00:50:07.705 region:rollup2
AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM CIRCLE

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:09.306 region:rollup2
ARABS AND IT'S CALLED MATH

00:50:07.705 --> 00:50:10.574 region:rollup2
REALLY MATH GAMES

00:50:09.306 --> 00:50:11.742 region:rollup2
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT OUR

00:50:10.574 --> 00:50:14.411 region:rollup2
FACULTY AND BRUCE OF PUT

00:50:11.742 --> 00:50:16.780 region:rollup2
TOGETHER. TO SHOW CARE GIVERS AS

00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:19.183 region:rollup2
WELL AS LITTLE KIDS ARM THE FUN

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:20.885 region:rollup2
STUFF.

00:50:19.183 --> 00:50:22.553 region:rollup2
AND I'LL JUST ADD ONE OF THE

00:50:20.885 --> 00:50:24.288 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PIECES OF.

00:50:22.553 --> 00:50:25.789 region:rollup2
OF HELPING PARENTS SEE WHAT

00:50:24.288 --> 00:50:27.291 region:rollup2
THEIR CAPACITY IS IS JUST

00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:28.158 region:rollup2
TALKING TO THEM HAVING THEM

00:50:27.291 --> 00:50:29.560 region:rollup2
TAKING THEM THROUGH SOME OF

00:50:28.158 --> 00:50:31.762 region:rollup2
THESE MATH ACTIVITIES.

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:33.864 region:rollup2
PARENTAGE EDUCATION.

00:50:31.762 --> 00:50:35.466 region:rollup2
IS AS IMPORTANT

00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:37.568 region:rollup2
AS A CHILD'S EDUCATION YOU

00:50:35.466 --> 00:50:39.236 region:rollup2
EDUCATE YOUR PARENTS TO EDUCATE

00:50:37.568 --> 00:50:41.105 region:rollup2
YOUR CHILDREN AND PROVIDE IT

00:50:39.236 --> 00:50:42.740 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM SO WE

00:50:41.105 --> 00:50:44.708 region:rollup2
OFFER ALMOST AS MUCH IN

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:46.610 region:rollup2
PARENTING EDUCATION. IN OUR

00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:47.378 region:rollup2
PRESCHOOLS IN OUR ELEMENTARY

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:49.179 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS.

00:50:47.378 --> 00:50:50.447 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY EVEN AT THE UNIVERSITY

00:50:49.179 --> 00:50:51.682 region:rollup2
LEVEL WE HAVE A PATHWAY THAT

00:50:50.447 --> 00:50:52.716 region:rollup2
INVOLVES PARENTS STARTING IN THE

00:50:51.682 --> 00:50:54.518 region:rollup2
TENTH GRADE.

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:56.153 region:rollup2
WHERE AND STARTING TO BUILD A

00:50:54.518 --> 00:50:57.922 region:rollup2
COLLEGE CULTURE WITH THEM BUT

00:50:56.153 --> 00:50:59.123 region:rollup2
REALLY EARLY ON IN THE

00:50:57.922 --> 00:51:00.758 region:rollup2
PRESCHOOLS? THIS PARENT

00:50:59.123 --> 00:51:02.359 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONS ARE SUCH RICHARD

00:51:00.758 --> 00:51:03.727 region:rollup2
PERTINENTES TO TAKE THEM THROUGH

00:51:02.359 --> 00:51:05.296 region:rollup2
THE MATH GAMES.

00:51:03.727 --> 00:51:07.164 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T THINK WHEN WE THINK

00:51:05.296 --> 00:51:08.866 region:rollup2
OF EDUCATION WE DON'T TYPICALLY

00:51:07.164 --> 00:51:10.367 region:rollup2
THINK OF PARENT EDUCATION WHO

00:51:08.866 --> 00:51:12.002 region:rollup2
THINK OF IT AS ó THEY HAVE A

00:51:10.367 --> 00:51:13.771 region:rollup2
DEGREE OR NOT ARE THEY GRADUATED

00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:15.005 region:rollup2
MY SCORE NOT. ITS CONTINUAL. AND

00:51:13.771 --> 00:51:17.875 region:rollup2
WHEN THE KIDS WHO THEIR PARENTS

00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:19.510 region:rollup2
LEARN AND ENJOY IT. THEY ALSO

00:51:17.875 --> 00:51:20.544 region:rollup2
THAT'S A MODEL FOR THE KIDS.

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:22.580 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY A MATTER OF

00:51:20.544 --> 00:51:24.281 region:rollup2
EMPOWERING THE PARENTS.

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:25.749 region:rollup2
IN IN THE HP AND ONE OF THE PROP

00:51:24.281 --> 00:51:27.217 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS IS WORKING WITH THE

00:51:25.749 --> 00:51:28.485 region:rollup2
PARENTS TO TEACH THEM AND THAT

00:51:27.217 --> 00:51:30.220 region:rollup2
ADVISORY BOARD THAT CAROLYN

00:51:28.485 --> 00:51:32.156 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT. IS A PARENT

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:33.624 region:rollup2
ADVISORY GROUP THAT COMES TO THE

00:51:32.156 --> 00:51:34.858 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY TO MEET PAY CHOSE TO

00:51:33.624 --> 00:51:36.060 region:rollup2
MEET UP AT THE UNIVERSITY ON

00:51:34.858 --> 00:51:38.228 region:rollup2
SATURDAYS CAROLINE MEETS WITH

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:40.230 region:rollup2
THEM. AND THEY WANT ONCE A MONTH

00:51:38.228 --> 00:51:41.699 region:rollup2
AND THEY WANT TO P. THEY'VE

00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:42.399 region:rollup2
TAKEN THE UNIVERSITY AS THEIR

00:51:41.699 --> 00:51:44.535 region:rollup2
HOME.

00:51:42.399 --> 00:51:46.136 region:rollup2
IT'S THEIR UNIVERSITY AND BUT IT

00:51:44.535 --> 00:51:48.205 region:rollup2
IS EMPOWERING THEM TO KNOW THE

00:51:46.136 --> 00:51:49.373 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS TO ASK IN THE THINGS

00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:50.874 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN DO AND THEY

00:51:49.373 --> 00:51:51.942 region:rollup2
EMBRACE IT.

00:51:50.874 --> 00:51:53.978 region:rollup2
LIKE YOU WERE GONNA ASK OUR

00:51:51.942 --> 00:51:54.578 region:rollup2
FRIENDS THE FIRST FIVE TO CHANGE

00:51:53.978 --> 00:51:56.547 region:rollup2
YOUR WHOLE CAMPAIGN YOU KNOW

00:51:54.578 --> 00:51:57.514 region:rollup2
THEY TALK ABOUT TALK READ SEEING

00:51:56.547 --> 00:51:58.983 region:rollup2
THAT TALK ABOUT THE BRAIN

00:51:57.514 --> 00:52:00.884 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR AND HOW EARLY IT WE

00:51:58.983 --> 00:52:03.320 region:rollup2
MUST EXPOSE KIDS EARLY. IS GOING

00:52:00.884 --> 00:52:06.490 region:rollup2
TO BE TALK READ SEEING SUMA TIES

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:07.725 region:rollup2
YEAH AN AD THAT WE CAN AND THAT

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:08.993 region:rollup2
IS.

00:52:07.725 --> 00:52:10.194 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA FIND ANOTHER WAY TO

00:52:08.993 --> 00:52:11.362 region:rollup2
SAY SUMA TIES SO IT FITS

00:52:10.194 --> 00:52:13.297 region:rollup2
INTO THE COMMERCIAL ON HOW TO

00:52:11.362 --> 00:52:15.165 region:rollup2
TALK READ SAYING SUPERSIZED.

00:52:13.297 --> 00:52:16.233 region:rollup2
COULD YOU SAY ONE LAST WORD ON

00:52:15.165 --> 00:52:17.835 region:rollup2
THE AREA OF PROFESSIONAL

00:52:16.233 --> 00:52:19.269 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS IN THIS

00:52:17.835 --> 00:52:21.972 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION COMES UP A LOT.

00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:23.073 region:rollup2
FOR TEACHERS WHO DON'T HAVE AN

00:52:21.972 --> 00:52:25.509 region:rollup2
IT BACKGROUND.

00:52:23.073 --> 00:52:27.845 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE SUPPORT EDUCATORS ON

00:52:25.509 --> 00:52:30.247 region:rollup2
TO BEING GAUGED AND PREPARING

00:52:27.845 --> 00:52:31.749 region:rollup2
STUDENTS? FOR STAND FOR.

00:52:30.247 --> 00:52:33.684 region:rollup2
BEING INVOLVED IN THE

00:52:31.749 --> 00:52:34.852 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION EVEN WHEN THE

00:52:33.684 --> 00:52:36.854 region:rollup2
EDUCATORS THEMSELVES ON HAVING

00:52:34.852 --> 00:52:37.755 region:rollup2
IT BACK.

00:52:36.854 --> 00:52:39.857 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

00:52:37.755 --> 00:52:42.192 region:rollup2
SO IT COMES ON THE SUMMATION OF

00:52:39.857 --> 00:52:44.294 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION SO AT OUR COUNTY

00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:46.263 region:rollup2
OFFICE LIKE MANY COUNTY OFFICES

00:52:44.294 --> 00:52:49.133 region:rollup2
WE HUB INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE AN

00:52:46.263 --> 00:52:51.201 region:rollup2
IT ENGINEERING AND MAKER SPACE.

00:52:49.133 --> 00:52:52.703 region:rollup2
MENTALITY BACKGROUND AND

00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:54.571 region:rollup2
TRAINING AND REALLY THINKING

00:52:52.703 --> 00:52:57.141 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW DO WE BREAK DOWN THE

00:52:54.571 --> 00:52:59.143 region:rollup2
SILOS OF EDUCATION WHERE. IT'S

00:52:57.141 --> 00:53:01.111 region:rollup2
MATH PERIOD AT SCIENCE PERIOD

00:52:59.143 --> 00:53:02.913 region:rollup2
ITS TECHNOLOGY TIME MORTON

00:53:01.111 --> 00:53:05.516 region:rollup2
INSTEAD HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT

00:53:02.913 --> 00:53:07.885 region:rollup2
THE UTILIZATION AND LEVERAGING

00:53:05.516 --> 00:53:09.987 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY. IN WAYS THAT HELP

00:53:07.885 --> 00:53:12.322 region:rollup2
YOU MAKE SENSE OF THE SCIENCE

00:53:09.987 --> 00:53:14.324 region:rollup2
THE MOUTH AND THE LITERACY. AND

00:53:12.322 --> 00:53:16.326 region:rollup2
AND AND UP OF THE APPLICATION OF

00:53:14.324 --> 00:53:17.928 region:rollup2
THAT TECHNOLOGY SO WHAT WE'VE

00:53:16.326 --> 00:53:20.497 region:rollup2
DONE IS WE'VE PARTNERED WITH

00:53:17.928 --> 00:53:22.533 region:rollup2
EXPERTS WHO. ARE TEACHERS WHO

00:53:20.497 --> 00:53:24.334 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO WORK WITH

00:53:22.533 --> 00:53:26.070 region:rollup2
OTHER TEACHERS THE POWER OF

00:53:24.334 --> 00:53:27.304 region:rollup2
TEACHERS LEADERSHIP. AND

00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:28.338 region:rollup2
TRAINING OF TEACHERS IN A WAY

00:53:27.304 --> 00:53:31.041 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY COME IN AND THEY

00:53:28.338 --> 00:53:32.409 region:rollup2
LEARN THROUGH APPLICATION HANDS

00:53:31.041 --> 00:53:33.711 region:rollup2
ON. AND THE CREATE.

00:53:32.409 --> 00:53:35.312 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT'S RELEVANT TO

00:53:33.711 --> 00:53:36.480 region:rollup2
THEIR DATED A PRACTICE AS A

00:53:35.312 --> 00:53:38.215 region:rollup2
TEACHER THAT THEY'RE GONNA TAKE

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.183 region:rollup2
BACK IN USE IN THE CLASSROOMS.

00:53:38.215 --> 00:53:40.517 region:rollup2
IS ONE OF THE BEST APPROACHIS

00:53:39.183 --> 00:53:42.553 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE FOUND BUT IT DOES

00:53:40.517 --> 00:53:44.655 region:rollup2
REQUIRE US TO.

00:53:42.553 --> 00:53:44.988 region:rollup2
MOVE AWAY FROM A SOLID APPROACH

00:53:44.655 --> 00:53:47.257 region:rollup2
OF.

00:53:44.988 --> 00:53:49.560 region:rollup2
CONTENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT

00:53:47.257 --> 00:53:50.761 region:rollup2
AROUND.

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:52.963 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE I THINK A REALLY

00:53:50.761 --> 00:53:54.331 region:rollup2
GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS AND WHEN WE

00:53:52.963 --> 00:53:55.933 region:rollup2
WERE PUZZLING OVER HOW DO YOU

00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:57.000 region:rollup2
DRAW MORE FEMALES IN SCIENCE

00:53:55.933 --> 00:53:59.436 region:rollup2
EARLIER ON.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.771 region:rollup2
WE HAD SOME FACULTY OFFICE OR

00:53:59.436 --> 00:54:03.006 region:rollup2
SCIENCE AND SCIENCE AT FACULTY

00:54:00.771 --> 00:54:05.109 region:rollup2
WERE PUZZLING OVER THIS. AND WE

00:54:03.006 --> 00:54:07.811 region:rollup2
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK.

00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:10.013 region:rollup2
TO GET SOME SOLAR SUITCASES

00:54:07.811 --> 00:54:11.949 region:rollup2
IN OUR WATER PHYSICS PROFESSOR.

00:54:10.013 --> 00:54:14.585 region:rollup2
WAS ABLE TO GET SOME FUNDING TO

00:54:11.949 --> 00:54:17.087 region:rollup2
ORDER REAL SOLAR SUITCASES AND

00:54:14.585 --> 00:54:19.223 region:rollup2
TEACH THE CONCEPTS OF PHYSICS.

00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:20.791 region:rollup2
BY BUILDING THE SOLAR SUITCASES

00:54:19.223 --> 00:54:23.026 region:rollup2
THEY DID THIS WITH A GROUP OF

00:54:20.791 --> 00:54:24.027 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.

00:54:23.026 --> 00:54:25.696 region:rollup2
MORE THAN HALF OF THEM WERE

00:54:24.027 --> 00:54:27.731 region:rollup2
FEMALE.

00:54:25.696 --> 00:54:29.600 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE PURPOSE WASN'T LET'S

00:54:27.731 --> 00:54:31.635 region:rollup2
LEARN PHYSICS LET'S LEARN

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:33.337 region:rollup2
SCIENCE THAT CAN BE APPLIED IN

00:54:31.635 --> 00:54:35.072 region:rollup2
MEANINGFUL PURPOSEFUL WAYS.

00:54:33.337 --> 00:54:37.508 region:rollup2
THE STUDENTS AND THAT'S THE KEY

00:54:35.072 --> 00:54:39.109 region:rollup2
THEY FOUND NO WOMEN DROPPED OUT

00:54:37.508 --> 00:54:40.844 region:rollup2
NO YOUNG WOMAN DROPPED OUT. THEY

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:42.246 region:rollup2
LOVED IT THEY THEN TOOK THE

00:54:40.844 --> 00:54:44.681 region:rollup2
SOLAR SUITCASES TO SOME OF OUR

00:54:42.246 --> 00:54:46.550 region:rollup2
PROMISE. TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD

00:54:44.681 --> 00:54:48.552 region:rollup2
MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS.

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:50.554 region:rollup2
BRAVE TRYING TO PILOTED AS AN

00:54:48.552 --> 00:54:52.289 region:rollup2
AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM AGAIN HALF

00:54:50.554 --> 00:54:54.091 region:rollup2
THE CLASS WAS WOMEN WERE WITH

00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:55.592 region:rollup2
HALF OF THE CLASS NINE YEAH MORE

00:54:54.091 --> 00:54:56.593 region:rollup2
THAN ACTUALLY HAVE CLASS.

00:54:55.592 --> 00:54:59.129 region:rollup2
THERE WAS AN AFTER SCHOOL

00:54:56.593 --> 00:55:00.798 region:rollup2
PROGRAM NOT ONE STUDENT FOR SIX

00:54:59.129 --> 00:55:02.199 region:rollup2
WEEKS MISSED

00:55:00.798 --> 00:55:03.801 region:rollup2
A CLASS BECAUSE THEY WERE

00:55:02.199 --> 00:55:04.601 region:rollup2
BUILDING IN A HANDS ON WAY

00:55:03.801 --> 00:55:06.370 region:rollup2
SOMETHING INTERESTING AND

00:55:04.601 --> 00:55:07.704 region:rollup2
PURPOSEFUL.

00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:08.906 region:rollup2
IS THERE SOLIS SUITCASES WERE

00:55:07.704 --> 00:55:10.140 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE SHIPPED TO A COUNTRY

00:55:08.906 --> 00:55:11.742 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY SAW PICTURES OF THE

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:13.177 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WHERE THAT WOULD BE

00:55:11.742 --> 00:55:14.278 region:rollup2
USING THESE IN THEIR CLASSROOMS

00:55:13.177 --> 00:55:16.013 region:rollup2
CROP OVERSEAS.

00:55:14.278 --> 00:55:17.514 region:rollup2
SO THE FACULTY NOW HAVE BUILT

00:55:16.013 --> 00:55:19.616 region:rollup2
THIS

00:55:17.514 --> 00:55:21.418 region:rollup2
APPROACH INTO THEIR THEIR

00:55:19.616 --> 00:55:23.287 region:rollup2
CURRICULUM.

00:55:21.418 --> 00:55:25.122 region:rollup2
FOR IT NEXT YEAR AT THE

00:55:23.287 --> 00:55:26.223 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY LEVEL AND AGAIN

00:55:25.122 --> 00:55:27.825 region:rollup2
TAKING A BACK.

00:55:26.223 --> 00:55:30.561 region:rollup2
I THINK KEEPING THE INTEREST OF

00:55:27.825 --> 00:55:32.396 region:rollup2
FEMALES. ARE OF GIRLS IN SCIENCE

00:55:30.561 --> 00:55:33.997 region:rollup2
IT HAS TO BE HANDS ON PASTOR

00:55:32.396 --> 00:55:35.399 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL AND I WOULD SAY IT NOT

00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:37.301 region:rollup2
EVEN JUST FOR WOMEN FOR MEN TOO.

00:55:35.399 --> 00:55:38.368 region:rollup2
FOR YOUNG MEN.

00:55:37.301 --> 00:55:40.103 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A MIX OF NON SCIENCE

00:55:38.368 --> 00:55:41.805 region:rollup2
MAJORS

00:55:40.103 --> 00:55:42.773 region:rollup2
ALSO THAT ARE THE STUDENTS AT

00:55:41.805 --> 00:55:43.841 region:rollup2
THE UNIVERSITY WASN'T ALL

00:55:42.773 --> 00:55:45.008 region:rollup2
SCIENCE PAGE NEWS BUSINESS

00:55:43.841 --> 00:55:46.410 region:rollup2
MAJORS IT WAS PEOPLE IN THE

00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:47.678 region:rollup2
SOCIAL SCIENCES.

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:49.513 region:rollup2
TAKING THAT CLASS AND THINKING

00:55:47.678 --> 00:55:50.013 region:rollup2
WELL I CAN DO THIS I CAN LEARN

00:55:49.513 --> 00:55:51.648 region:rollup2
ABOUT SCIENCE AND I CAN

00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:53.016 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER.

00:55:51.648 --> 00:55:54.184 region:rollup2
BUT THE OTHER PART OF IT WAS THE

00:55:53.016 --> 00:55:55.786 region:rollup2
SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY

00:55:54.184 --> 00:55:57.854 region:rollup2
COMPONENT OF IT. OF REALLY

00:55:55.786 --> 00:55:59.856 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THAT PART IN WHAT

00:55:57.854 --> 00:56:00.791 region:rollup2
THE SOLICITOR EXTRA GONNA DO TO

00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:03.193 region:rollup2
THESE PEOPLE IN COUNTRIES THAT

00:56:00.791 --> 00:56:03.727 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE ELECTRICITY AND DON'T

00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:04.595 region:rollup2
HAVE POWER AND DON'T HAVE

00:56:03.727 --> 00:56:10.901 region:rollup2
LIGHTING.

00:56:04.595 --> 00:56:11.468 region:rollup2
KEEP DO NOT SOLICIT CASES ARE.

00:56:10.901 --> 00:56:14.037 region:rollup2
THANK YOU WE.

00:56:11.468 --> 00:56:15.639 region:rollup2

CHANGE OUR NAME FROM STEM TO

00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:03.814 region:rollup2
STEAM. ALTHOUGH I KNOW DEPENDING

00:58:02.179 --> 00:58:05.682 region:rollup2
ON WHERE YOU ARE IN THE STATE OF

00:58:03.814 --> 00:58:07.184 region:rollup2
THE A COULD BE ARTSY COULD BE

00:58:05.682 --> 00:58:08.685 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURE SO.

00:58:07.184 --> 00:58:10.087 region:rollup2
THAT MIA GENERATE LITTLE THE

00:58:08.685 --> 00:58:11.355 region:rollup2

BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND

00:58:24.468 --> 00:58:29.573 region:rollup2
PHILANTHROPY. TO REALLY IDENTIFY

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:31.208 region:rollup2
SCALE AND SO STAINED EFFECTIVE

00:58:29.573 --> 00:58:32.743 region:rollup2
STEM TEACHING AND LEARNING.

00:58:31.208 --> 00:58:34.544 region:rollup2
HOW WE WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH

00:58:32.743 --> 00:58:36.313 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN AFFILIATED REGIONAL

ACROSS THE STATE THAT STRETCH

00:58:37.581 --> 00:58:40.350 region:rollup2
FROM STRESS SHASTA COUNTY THE

00:58:38.915 --> 00:58:42.719 region:rollup2
SAN DIEGO AND OF COURSE THAT

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:44.588 region:rollup2
INCLUDES US YES YOU EAST BAY?

00:58:42.719 --> 00:58:47.190 region:rollup2
THROUGH POLICY ADVOCACY

00:58:44.588 --> 00:58:48.759 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIONS OUT REACH WE

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:50.293 region:rollup2
STRIVE TO ENSURE THAT ALL

00:58:48.759 --> 00:58:51.962 region:rollup2
STUDENTS BUT ESPECIALLY THOSE

00:58:50.293 --> 00:58:53.563 region:rollup2
WHO'VE BEEN UNDERSERVED AND

00:58:51.962 --> 00:58:55.699 region:rollup2
UNDERREPRESENTED. IN STEM

00:58:53.563 --> 00:58:57.467 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINES TO HAVE ACCESS TO

00:58:55.699 --> 00:58:59.302 region:rollup2
THE HIGHEST QUALITY STEM

00:58:57.467 --> 00:59:00.637 region:rollup2
EDUCATION POSSIBLE.

00:58:59.302 --> 00:59:01.738 region:rollup2
COME I'D LIKE TO START WITH A

00:59:00.637 --> 00:59:03.473 region:rollup2
FEW.

00:59:01.738 --> 00:59:06.343 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT DATA POINTS.

00:59:03.473 --> 00:59:07.511 region:rollup2
JUST TO FRAME MY COMMENTS.

00:59:06.343 --> 00:59:09.446 region:rollup2
I THINK MOST FOLKS ARE AWARE OF

00:59:07.511 --> 00:59:10.781 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANCE OF STEM OR STEAM

00:59:09.446 --> 00:59:12.582 region:rollup2
TO OUR ECONOMY.

00:59:10.781 --> 00:59:14.451 region:rollup2
SEVEN OF THE TEN FASTEST

00:59:12.582 --> 00:59:16.253 region:rollup2
GROWING OCCUPATIONS IN STEM

00:59:14.451 --> 00:59:18.088 region:rollup2
FIELDS.

00:59:16.253 --> 00:59:19.689 region:rollup2
SEVEN OF THE TEN EXCUSE ME

00:59:18.088 --> 00:59:21.358 region:rollup2
FASTEST GROWING OCCUPATIONS ARE

00:59:19.689 --> 00:59:22.959 region:rollup2
IN STEM FIELDS.

00:59:21.358 --> 00:59:24.861 region:rollup2
AND IN BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:59:22.959 --> 00:59:26.663 region:rollup2
EIGHT AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN STEM

00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:28.365 region:rollup2
JOBS IN CALIFORNIA GREW BY

00:59:26.663 --> 00:59:29.533 region:rollup2
NINETEEN PERCENT. AND I THINK

00:59:28.365 --> 00:59:30.901 region:rollup2
THAT GROWTH IS CERTAINLY

00:59:29.533 --> 00:59:32.803 region:rollup2
PROJECTED TO.

00:59:30.901 --> 00:59:34.771 region:rollup2
AT LEAST MAINTAINED IF NOT

00:59:32.803 --> 00:59:36.940 region:rollup2
INCREASE.

00:59:34.771 --> 00:59:39.643 region:rollup2
NOW DESPITE THESE NUMBERS OUR

00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:41.511 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS DON'T OFFER COURSES THAT

00:59:39.643 --> 00:59:44.247 region:rollup2
ARE CRITICAL FOR STEM EDUCATION

00:59:41.511 --> 00:59:45.348 region:rollup2
AND PREPARING FOR STEM CAREERS.

00:59:44.247 --> 00:59:47.717 region:rollup2
SO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR

00:59:45.348 --> 00:59:48.685 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS DON'T OFFER CALCULUS.

00:59:47.717 --> 00:59:50.353 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN PERCENT DON'T OFFER

00:59:48.685 --> 00:59:51.521 region:rollup2
PHYSICS

00:59:50.353 --> 00:59:53.490 region:rollup2
AND TEN PERCENT DON'T OFFER

00:59:51.521 --> 00:59:55.859 region:rollup2
CHEMISTRY.

00:59:53.490 --> 00:59:58.361 region:rollup2
SO. IN ADDITION THOUGH TO THIS

00:59:55.859 --> 01:00:00.230 region:rollup2
LIMITED ACCESS TO STEM COURSES

00:59:58.361 --> 01:00:01.298 region:rollup2
WE ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:03.633 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS IN STEM

01:00:01.298 --> 01:00:06.470 region:rollup2
EDUCATION. THAT ARE MOST.

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:08.205 region:rollup2
PRONOUNCED BY RACE AND ETHNICITY

01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:10.407 region:rollup2
AND THIS TRANSLATES INTO MAJOR

01:00:08.205 --> 01:00:12.375 region:rollup2
INEQUITIES FOR OUR STUDENTS.

01:00:10.407 --> 01:00:13.110 region:rollup2
THE SO THIS IS BASED ON THE

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:15.846 region:rollup2
NATIONAL.

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:18.315 region:rollup2
REPORT CARD SOME NAY DATA.

01:00:15.846 --> 01:00:20.016 region:rollup2
BUT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN EIGHTEEN

01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:22.085 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF AFRICAN AMERICAN AND

01:00:20.016 --> 01:00:23.487 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN PERCENT OF LATINO

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:24.921 region:rollup2
FOURTH GRADERS WERE PROFICIENT

01:00:23.487 --> 01:00:26.456 region:rollup2
IN MATH.

01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:28.191 region:rollup2
BY THE EIGHTH GRADE THOSE

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:29.493 region:rollup2
NUMBERS DROPPED TO FOURTEEN

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:31.595 region:rollup2
PERCENT AND THIRTEEN PERCENT

01:00:29.493 --> 01:00:32.929 region:rollup2
RESPECTIVELY.

01:00:31.595 --> 01:00:34.931 region:rollup2
THE NUMBERS FOR SCIENCE ARE

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:36.666 region:rollup2
EQUALLY TROUBLING.

01:00:34.931 --> 01:00:38.368 region:rollup2
PROFICIENCY FOR OF AFRICAN

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:41.671 region:rollup2
AMERICAN AND LATINO STUDENTS IN

01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:43.473 region:rollup2
GRADES FOUR AND A REMAIN STATIC

01:00:41.671 --> 01:00:45.575 region:rollup2
AT ABOUT ELEVEN PERCENT.

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:47.611 region:rollup2
SO WE SEE THAT WE HAVE A

01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:49.713 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND

01:00:47.611 --> 01:00:51.248 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF MAKING PROGRESS AS

01:00:49.713 --> 01:00:52.883 region:rollup2
CHILDREN PROGRESS THROUGH THEIR

01:00:51.248 --> 01:00:55.252 region:rollup2
ORIGINAL EDUCATIONAL CAREERS

01:00:52.883 --> 01:00:57.521 region:rollup2
WERE ACTUALLY MOVING.

01:00:55.252 --> 01:00:59.289 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ARE BACKWARD OR WERE

01:00:57.521 --> 01:01:01.158 region:rollup2
STAYING THE SAME.

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:03.660 region:rollup2
SO FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:05.529 region:rollup2
NETWORK THE ISSUES OF ACCESS

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:07.864 region:rollup2
EQUITY AND STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT

01:01:05.529 --> 01:01:10.767 region:rollup2
IN STEM EDUCATION HARI STATEWIDE

01:01:07.864 --> 01:01:12.002 region:rollup2
CONCERN. AND ONE THAT WE BELIEVE

01:01:10.767 --> 01:01:13.603 region:rollup2
ARE REQUIRES STATEWIDE

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:15.972 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP.

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:18.542 region:rollup2
HAS A STATE CALIFORNIA MUST

01:01:15.972 --> 01:01:20.177 region:rollup2
MAKE STEM EDUCATION A PRIORITY

01:01:18.542 --> 01:01:22.178 region:rollup2
AND INVEST ACCORDINGLY.

01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:23.446 region:rollup2
SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO.

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:24.781 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT

01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:26.583 region:rollup2
THE BENEFITS OF EARLY MATH

01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:27.951 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTION AND I WOULD LIKE TO

01:01:26.583 --> 01:01:29.819 region:rollup2
GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO THE FOLKS AT

01:01:27.951 --> 01:01:31.188 region:rollup2
FIRST FIVE I KNOW THAT I'VE

01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:33.490 region:rollup2
RECENTLY SEEN SOME OF THEIR.

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:35.892 region:rollup2
NEW COMMERCIALS RUNNING WHERE

01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:37.360 region:rollup2
IT IS BOTH TALK READ SING AND

01:01:35.892 --> 01:01:39.529 region:rollup2
COUNT.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:41.498 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE TO GET THEM TO MAYBE

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:41.898 region:rollup2
BROADEN THAT LITTLE BIT BUT I

01:01:41.498 --> 01:01:43.099 region:rollup2
THINK THERE IS AN

01:01:41.898 --> 01:01:46.136 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.

01:01:43.099 --> 01:01:47.404 region:rollup2
THAT THAT MATH LITERACY IN THE

01:01:46.136 --> 01:01:49.072 region:rollup2
EARLY GRADES IS INCREDIBLY

01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:50.807 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:53.577 region:rollup2
WE CERTAINLY KNOW BASED ON

01:01:50.807 --> 01:01:55.145 region:rollup2
BRAIN RESEARCH ECONOMIC ANALYSES

01:01:53.577 --> 01:01:56.413 region:rollup2
THAT INVESTING IN OUR YOUNGEST

01:01:55.145 --> 01:01:58.348 region:rollup2
CHILDREN YIELDS THE MOST

01:01:56.413 --> 01:02:00.016 region:rollup2
POSITIVE IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM

01:01:58.348 --> 01:02:01.985 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

01:02:00.016 --> 01:02:03.787 region:rollup2
EXPOSURE TO HIGH QUALITY

01:02:01.985 --> 01:02:05.689 region:rollup2
ENGAGING MATH AND SCIENCE

01:02:03.787 --> 01:02:07.324 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTION IN THE EARLY YEARS

01:02:05.689 --> 01:02:08.925 region:rollup2
HELPS TO CREATE A MORE POSITIVE

01:02:07.324 --> 01:02:09.826 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION WITH THE SUBJECTS.

01:02:08.925 --> 01:02:10.760 region:rollup2
AND PROMOTE GREATER STUDENT

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:14.130 region:rollup2
INTEREST.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:15.899 region:rollup2
.

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:17.400 region:rollup2
TRINA HAD MENTIONED I THINK.

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:19.836 region:rollup2
THE.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.738 region:rollup2
BENEFITS OF EARLY MATH SKILLS

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:23.940 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT COMPREHENSION. A OF

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:25.508 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE MATH

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:27.711 region:rollup2
SKILLS AND CONCEPTS IS ACTUALLY

01:02:25.508 --> 01:02:30.046 region:rollup2
A STRONGER PREDICTOR OF LONGER

01:02:27.711 --> 01:02:31.681 region:rollup2
TERM ACADEMIC SUCCESS EVEN MORE

01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:32.215 region:rollup2
SO THAN LITERACY. I THINK THIS

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:33.883 region:rollup2
RESEARCH COMING OUT OF UC

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:36.253 region:rollup2
IRVINE.

01:02:33.883 --> 01:02:38.521 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY SUBSTANTIATES THIS

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:40.724 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS ELSEWHERE.

01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:42.892 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE.

01:02:40.724 --> 01:02:44.894 region:rollup2
MATH AND SCIENCE CURRICULUM ALSO

01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:46.630 region:rollup2
PROVIDES ENGLISH.

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:48.465 region:rollup2
LEARNERS WITH CONCRETE

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:50.567 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES.

01:02:48.465 --> 01:02:51.568 region:rollup2
PRACTICE REFINED THEIR SPEAKING

01:02:50.567 --> 01:02:53.236 region:rollup2
LISTENING CRITICAL THINKING

01:02:51.568 --> 01:02:54.971 region:rollup2
SKILLS.

01:02:53.236 --> 01:02:56.740 region:rollup2
SO THE QUESTION ISN'T SO MUCH

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:58.308 region:rollup2
WHETHER KIDS ARE READY TO ENGAGE

01:02:56.740 --> 01:03:01.077 region:rollup2
IN THE SUBJECTS HAVE AN EARLY

01:02:58.308 --> 01:03:02.679 region:rollup2
AGE BUT RATHER OUR COMMITMENT TO

01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:04.414 region:rollup2
PROVIDING THE NECESSARY ACCESS

01:03:02.679 --> 01:03:06.182 region:rollup2
AND SUPPORTS FOR HIGH QUALITY

01:03:04.414 --> 01:03:08.685 region:rollup2
STEM INSTRUCTION.

01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:10.620 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT T. K. BUT ESPECIALLY

01:03:08.685 --> 01:03:11.221 region:rollup2
THE ELEMENTARY GRADES.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:16.993 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS WHY THE CALIFORNIA

01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:18.762 region:rollup2
THEM EDUCATION AND INCREASED

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:20.063 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FOR EDUCATORS IN STEM

01:03:18.762 --> 01:03:22.599 region:rollup2
SUBJECTS.

01:03:20.063 --> 01:03:24.267 region:rollup2
AS POLICY PRIORITIES.

01:03:22.599 --> 01:03:24.901 region:rollup2
A RECENT REPORT I THINK THIS IS

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:27.137 region:rollup2
FROM THE.

01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:28.738 region:rollup2
A NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:31.408 region:rollup2
FOUND THAT AMONG ELEMENTARY

01:03:28.738 --> 01:03:33.143 region:rollup2
EDUCATORS ONLY ABOUT A THIRD

01:03:31.408 --> 01:03:35.545 region:rollup2
REPORTED HAVING COMPLETED AT

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:36.813 region:rollup2
LEAST ONE COURSE. IN THE STEM

01:03:35.545 --> 01:03:38.515 region:rollup2
SUBJECTS OF LIFE.

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:41.451 region:rollup2
EARTH AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES

01:03:38.515 --> 01:03:43.687 region:rollup2
DURING THEIR EDUCATION PROGRAMS.

01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:45.989 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS WHY WE SUPPORT SOME

01:03:43.687 --> 01:03:46.890 region:rollup2
VERY SPECIFIC STEPS THAT WE

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:49.392 region:rollup2
THINK WILL HELP ADDRESS THE

01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:51.094 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF TEACHER TRAINING THE

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:53.763 region:rollup2
TEACHER PIPELINE AND REALLY

01:03:51.094 --> 01:03:55.999 region:rollup2
BUILDING OUT A MUCH MORE ROBUST.

01:03:53.763 --> 01:03:56.533 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SERVE MORE TO

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:57.200 region:rollup2
SUPPORT STEM TEACHING AND

01:03:56.533 --> 01:03:59.002 region:rollup2
LEARNING.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:00.170 region:rollup2
SO FIRST

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:02.439 region:rollup2
A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:03.540 region:rollup2
STEM TEACHERS PRINCIPALS AND

01:04:02.439 --> 01:04:05.175 region:rollup2
SCHOOL LEADERS IN THE ELEMENTARY

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:07.644 region:rollup2
GRADES.

01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:09.946 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO EXPAND THE PIPELINE

01:04:07.644 --> 01:04:12.482 region:rollup2
OF NEW STEM TEACHERS BY FUNDING

01:04:09.946 --> 01:04:13.817 region:rollup2
MORE TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS

01:04:12.482 --> 01:04:15.852 region:rollup2
I'M I THINK THIS IS A POINT THAT

01:04:13.817 --> 01:04:18.154 region:rollup2
CAME UP EARLIER IN TERMS OF THE

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:19.689 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT THE CSU CERTAINLY

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:20.757 region:rollup2
AT THE FOREFRONT WEEDS I'VE BEEN

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:22.692 region:rollup2
TALKING WITH FOLKS FROM CAMPUSES

01:04:20.757 --> 01:04:25.028 region:rollup2
IN THE. CSU CHANCES OFFICE AS TO

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:25.862 region:rollup2
HOW WE CAN REALLY DRAMATICALLY

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:27.997 region:rollup2
INCREASE THOSE EFFORTS.

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:30.867 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO FUND INCENTIVES TO

01:04:27.997 --> 01:04:33.136 region:rollup2
ATTRACT NEW AND RETAIN EXISTING

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:34.938 region:rollup2
TEACHERS TO MAKE THIS PROFESSION

01:04:33.136 --> 01:04:36.773 region:rollup2
APPEALING AND TO COMPETE QUITE

01:04:34.938 --> 01:04:38.141 region:rollup2
HONESTLY FOR THE BEST AND THE

01:04:36.773 --> 01:04:41.177 region:rollup2
BRIGHTEST FOR BEING LURED AWAY.

01:04:38.141 --> 01:04:42.412 region:rollup2
BY CAREERS IN IN TACK AND AND

01:04:41.177 --> 01:04:43.546 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT THE DISPARITIES

01:04:42.412 --> 01:04:45.014 region:rollup2
THERE IN TERMS OF OF THE

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:46.750 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC REWARDS BUT THERE ARE

01:04:45.014 --> 01:04:47.784 region:rollup2
OTHER REWARDS. IN TERMS OF

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:48.885 region:rollup2
COMING INTO THE TEACHING

01:04:47.784 --> 01:04:50.487 region:rollup2
PROFESSION THAT WE REALLY NEED

01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:51.755 region:rollup2
TO TALK UP.

01:04:50.487 --> 01:04:53.656 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO PROVIDE GREATER

01:04:51.755 --> 01:04:55.425 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO STEM INSTRUCTION FOR

01:04:53.656 --> 01:04:56.926 region:rollup2
STUDENTS IN RURAL SCHOOLS AND

01:04:55.425 --> 01:04:58.461 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS WE KNOW THAT THERE IS

01:04:56.926 --> 01:05:01.097 region:rollup2
GREAT DISPARITY IN TERMS OF.

01:04:58.461 --> 01:05:02.766 region:rollup2
THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS THAT

01:05:01.097 --> 01:05:03.566 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTION IN THAT RANGES

01:05:02.766 --> 01:05:05.902 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING FROM.

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:07.804 region:rollup2
THE DIGITAL DIVIDE TO THE

01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:09.272 region:rollup2
ACCESS OF.

01:05:07.804 --> 01:05:11.141 region:rollup2
AP COURSES AND A WHOLE HOST OF

01:05:09.272 --> 01:05:12.142 region:rollup2
OTHER ISSUES THAT WE THINK WE

01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:13.877 region:rollup2
NEED TO ADDRESS.

01:05:12.142 --> 01:05:15.478 region:rollup2
WE WANNA SEE AN INCREASED

01:05:13.877 --> 01:05:17.614 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:19.416 region:rollup2
EDUCATION IN TERMS OF STEM

01:05:17.614 --> 01:05:21.050 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONS WE KNOW THAT.

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:22.786 region:rollup2
THE GROWTH.

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:24.187 region:rollup2
WITHIN JOBS THAT REQUIRE

01:05:22.786 --> 01:05:25.021 region:rollup2
COMPUTER SCIENCE TRAINING OR

01:05:24.187 --> 01:05:27.357 region:rollup2
DEGREES.

01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:28.825 region:rollup2
IS AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT IF

01:05:27.357 --> 01:05:30.727 region:rollup2
NOT MORE OVER THE NEXT.

01:05:28.825 --> 01:05:33.163 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS.

01:05:30.727 --> 01:05:34.731 region:rollup2
WE ALSO WANT TO SEE A STUDY OF

01:05:33.163 --> 01:05:36.533 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF INSTRUCTIONAL TIME

01:05:34.731 --> 01:05:38.001 region:rollup2
IT'S BEING SPENT ON MATH AND

01:05:36.533 --> 01:05:40.437 region:rollup2
SCIENCE.

01:05:38.001 --> 01:05:42.238 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN WORK TO BALANCE THAT

01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:43.540 region:rollup2
OUT SO THAT STUDENTS DO GET THE

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:44.874 region:rollup2
SKILLS THEY NEED FROM A VERY

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:46.910 region:rollup2
EARLY AGE WITHIN THEIR

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:47.610 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL CAREER. TO BECOME

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:49.979 region:rollup2
MORE PROFICIENT AND.

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:51.414 region:rollup2
DO WELL ACADEMICALLY AS THEY

01:05:49.979 --> 01:05:54.317 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD.

01:05:51.414 --> 01:05:56.152 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE ITEMS ARE DRESSED.

01:05:54.317 --> 01:05:56.786 region:rollup2
OR WILL BE ADDRESSED IN

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:57.921 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE EIGHTY

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:59.355 region:rollup2
SIX.

01:05:57.921 --> 01:06:01.958 region:rollup2
BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER THURMAN.

01:05:59.355 --> 01:06:03.059 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA STEM NETWORK IS

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:04.594 region:rollup2

BILL RIGHT.

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:27.350 region:rollup2
WE ARE ASKING FOR A TWO HUNDRED

01:06:26.216 --> 01:06:29.018 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS INVESTMENT.

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:30.753 region:rollup2

01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:33.490 region:rollup2
AND MORE PROFESSIONAL

01:06:31.221 --> 01:06:35.625 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT ARE AROUND STEM AND

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:39.362 region:rollup2
A FOCUS. ON RURAL.

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:41.798 region:rollup2
AREAS THAT HAVE NOT HAD ACCESS

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:44.801 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SO MUCH OBSERVE STUART

01:06:41.798 --> 01:06:45.335 region:rollup2
I WENT OVER TO OUR COLLEAGUES ON

01:06:44.801 --> 01:06:46.369 region:rollup2
THE DEMOCRAT SILVA FOR FEW

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:48.338 region:rollup2
REMARKS.

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:49.706 region:rollup2
GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY AND NINE

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:51.541 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON THIS

COMMITTEE. I DO HAVE SOME

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:54.510 region:rollup2
COMMENTS AND THEN A FEW

01:06:52.575 --> 01:06:55.845 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS AND AS I CAME IN LATE

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:58.114 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T HEAR ALL OF

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:58.748 region:rollup2
THE PRESENTATION BUT THERE WERE

01:06:58.114 --> 01:06:59.182 region:rollup2
A FEW THINGS THAT JUMPED OUT AT

01:06:58.748 --> 01:07:01.551 region:rollup2
ME.

01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:04.354 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN A A. B. ELEMENTARY

01:07:01.551 --> 01:07:05.755 region:rollup2
TEACHER FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:06.789 region:rollup2
AND I.

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:08.291 region:rollup2
I JUST WANNA SEE WHO'S IN THE

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:09.492 region:rollup2
AUDIENCE DO WE HAVE ANY

01:07:08.291 --> 01:07:12.395 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLES OUT THERE. IN THE

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:14.797 region:rollup2
AUDIENCE.

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:20.069 region:rollup2
ANY TRUSTEES PART OF TRUSTEES.

01:07:14.797 --> 01:07:21.905 region:rollup2
A ANY SUPERINTENDENTS.

01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:24.140 region:rollup2
OKAY IT'S GOING THROUGH. SO

01:07:21.905 --> 01:07:25.508 region:rollup2
FIRST EARNED IN AGAIN I'M JUST

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:27.343 region:rollup2
I'M I'M GONNA TRY NOT TO TAKE

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:28.344 region:rollup2
TOO MUCH TIME HERE BUT.

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:30.580 region:rollup2
.

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:32.282 region:rollup2
IN THIRTY YEARS YOU SEE SWINGS

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:34.083 region:rollup2
FROM.

01:07:32.282 --> 01:07:36.185 region:rollup2
WAY BACK IN THE EIGHTIES WHEN I

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:38.054 region:rollup2
STARTED TEACHING THAT WE DID

01:07:36.185 --> 01:07:39.656 region:rollup2
MATH THEIR WAY I DON'T DOES

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:41.224 region:rollup2
ANYBODY REMEMBER MATH THEIR WAY.

01:07:39.656 --> 01:07:42.892 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE A FEW PEOPLE MATH

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:44.561 region:rollup2
THEIR WAY WAS ACTUALLY EARLY

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:47.163 region:rollup2
CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:49.732 region:rollup2
THAT FOCUSED ON HANDS ON MATH.

01:07:47.163 --> 01:07:51.801 region:rollup2
WHERE KIDS WERE COUNTING

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:53.736 region:rollup2
TOUCHING MEASURING ALL OF THESE

01:07:51.801 --> 01:07:55.672 region:rollup2
THINGS ARE HUGE AMOUNT OF

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:57.173 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT AND KIT SIN? AND ALL

01:07:55.672 --> 01:07:59.342 region:rollup2
OF THESE THINGS TEACHERS SPEND

01:07:57.173 --> 01:08:02.178 region:rollup2
THEIR WEEKENDS COLORING LITTLE.

01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:03.513 region:rollup2
BEINGS MAKING FACES ON I'M

01:08:02.178 --> 01:08:05.281 region:rollup2
COLLECTING THINGS ON THE WHOLE

01:08:03.513 --> 01:08:06.950 region:rollup2
EMPHASIS WAS THINGS LIKE MAKING

01:08:05.281 --> 01:08:07.884 region:rollup2
PATTERNS SO EVENTUALLY WHEN THEY

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:10.019 region:rollup2
GOT OLDER.

01:08:07.884 --> 01:08:10.853 region:rollup2
THEN THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND SOME

01:08:10.019 --> 01:08:13.656 region:rollup2
OF THESE.

01:08:10.853 --> 01:08:16.059 region:rollup2
KIND OF PATTERNS YOU SEE AND

01:08:13.656 --> 01:08:17.660 region:rollup2
HIGHER ED IN MATH AND. THEN WE

01:08:16.059 --> 01:08:19.562 region:rollup2
WENT ALL THE WAY BACK TO

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:23.333 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING WAS KIND OF PAPER

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:24.567 region:rollup2
PENCIL AND VERY RIGOR AND WE'RE

01:08:23.333 --> 01:08:27.604 region:rollup2
NOT DOING THIS PLANE

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:29.472 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTAL STUFF AND THEN WE

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:31.140 region:rollup2
CUT IT. BACK THE OTHER WAY AND

01:08:29.472 --> 01:08:32.141 region:rollup2
BY NOW WE'RE MOVING BACK THE

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:34.310 region:rollup2
OTHER WAY SO.

01:08:32.141 --> 01:08:36.579 region:rollup2
WHEN I HEAR ABOUT THINGS LIKE

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:39.082 region:rollup2
TEACHER TRAINING AND

01:08:36.579 --> 01:08:40.416 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL DIE IN A. AYE AYE I

01:08:39.082 --> 01:08:42.151 region:rollup2
DO WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:44.420 region:rollup2
TEACHERS BECAUSE EVEN SOMETHING

01:08:42.151 --> 01:08:47.056 region:rollup2
THAT YOU JUST SAID ABOUT LIKE

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:48.791 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH TIME IS SOMEBODY REALLY

01:08:47.056 --> 01:08:49.125 region:rollup2
SPENDING ON MATH OR SCIENCE IN

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:49.826 region:rollup2
THEIR CLASS.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.393 region:rollup2
I WOULD ASK ALL OF YOU TO DO THE

01:08:49.826 --> 01:08:51.027 region:rollup2
MATH EQUATION OF HOW MANY

01:08:50.393 --> 01:08:52.562 region:rollup2
MINUTES ARE MANDATED FOR EACH

01:08:51.027 --> 01:08:54.530 region:rollup2
SUBJECT AND THERE'S ABSOLUTELY

01:08:52.562 --> 01:08:56.766 region:rollup2
NO WAY THAT TEACHERS CAN DO

01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:59.035 region:rollup2
EVERY SINGLE THING. THAT IS

01:08:56.766 --> 01:09:01.571 region:rollup2
REQUIRED EVEN BY THE STATE FOR

01:08:59.035 --> 01:09:03.339 region:rollup2
CURRICULUM WHETHER BP. UP P. E.

01:09:01.571 --> 01:09:04.240 region:rollup2
HERE ARE ACTOR ALL OF THESE

01:09:03.339 --> 01:09:07.710 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:09.545 region:rollup2
DONE AYE AND DO YOU KNOW A HUGE

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:10.813 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT AS YOU'RE SAYING. NOW

01:09:09.545 --> 01:09:12.181 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN TEACHERS

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:14.150 region:rollup2
DID QUITE A BIT OF THEMATIC

01:09:12.181 --> 01:09:15.418 region:rollup2
TEACHING THAT ALLOW THEM TO

01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:17.220 region:rollup2
MAYBE PULL IN SOME LITERATURE

01:09:15.418 --> 01:09:18.988 region:rollup2
LITERACY AND THINGS THAT MIGHT

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:21.791 region:rollup2
MAYBE THEY WERE DOING MATH ALONG

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:24.060 region:rollup2
WITH THAT. BUT THE THE OVERALL

01:09:21.791 --> 01:09:26.129 region:rollup2
ARCHING THING IS WE WANT THIS

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:27.063 region:rollup2
CURRICULUM YOU KNOW IT'S GOOD WE

01:09:26.129 --> 01:09:28.464 region:rollup2
KNOW IT'S GOOD THE KIDS KNOW

01:09:27.063 --> 01:09:30.767 region:rollup2
IT'S GOOD YOU SEE AN ENGAGEMENT

01:09:28.464 --> 01:09:32.635 region:rollup2
YOU SEE A RESPONSE BUT THEN THE

01:09:30.767 --> 01:09:34.570 region:rollup2
WHOLE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY.

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:36.939 region:rollup2
IS AND THAT'S WHY I ASKED ABOUT

01:09:34.570 --> 01:09:39.142 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLES ADMINISTRATORS AND

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:39.609 region:rollup2
TRUSTEES THEY WANT HIGH TEST

01:09:39.142 --> 01:09:41.177 region:rollup2
SCORES.

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:43.112 region:rollup2
AND EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY THEY

01:09:41.177 --> 01:09:44.914 region:rollup2
WANT ENRICHED CLASSROOMS AND

01:09:43.112 --> 01:09:46.482 region:rollup2
THEY WANT EVERYBODY GOING FROM

01:09:44.914 --> 01:09:47.016 region:rollup2
GROUP TO GROUP BUT COLLABORATIVE

01:09:46.482 --> 01:09:48.818 region:rollup2
THINKING AND ALL OF THESE

01:09:47.016 --> 01:09:50.586 region:rollup2
THINGS.

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:52.488 region:rollup2
BOTTOM LINE IS THEY WANT.

01:09:50.586 --> 01:09:54.490 region:rollup2
HIGH TEST SCORES AND THE WAY THE

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:56.125 region:rollup2
STATE TESTS KIDS AND ALL THE

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:58.094 region:rollup2
OTHER TESTING THAT DISTRICTS ARE

01:09:56.125 --> 01:10:00.163 region:rollup2
PUTTING ON TEACHERS SO IT'S NOT

01:09:58.094 --> 01:10:02.532 region:rollup2
JUST THE STATE TETE TESTY BUT

01:10:00.163 --> 01:10:04.067 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS

01:10:02.532 --> 01:10:06.102 region:rollup2
THAT PUT THEIR OWN TESTING ON.

01:10:04.067 --> 01:10:07.603 region:rollup2
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE CURRICULUM

01:10:06.102 --> 01:10:09.605 region:rollup2
BOOKS THAT PUT TESTING ON. IN

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:11.307 region:rollup2
ORDER FOR THOSE KIDS TO DO WELL

01:10:09.605 --> 01:10:12.508 region:rollup2
THIS STUFF GETS CUT OUT SOME OF

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:14.477 region:rollup2
THE DISCONNECT HOW YOU THAT WE

01:10:12.508 --> 01:10:17.246 region:rollup2
CAN GO AROUND IN CIRCLES TALKING

01:10:14.477 --> 01:10:19.048 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS AND WE CAN TALK FOR

01:10:17.246 --> 01:10:20.550 region:rollup2
WEEKS AND DAYS. BUT THE TRUTH IS

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:22.718 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO GO INTO THOSE

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:24.253 region:rollup2
CLASSROOMS AND YOU HAVE TO SEE

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:27.056 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT IS EXPECTED WITH THE

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:29.559 region:rollup2
TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND TO

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:31.761 region:rollup2
EVEN GET JUST IMAGINE THIRTY

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:33.529 region:rollup2
THIRD GRADERS. ON TO ALL KINDS

01:10:31.761 --> 01:10:36.332 region:rollup2
OF COMPUTER STUFF AND FINING THE

01:10:33.529 --> 01:10:38.167 region:rollup2
CHARGERS THAT WORK AND FINDING

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:38.901 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHO'S COMPUTER DOESN'T

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:42.004 region:rollup2
LOAD UP AND WHO DOESN'T KNOW

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:43.940 region:rollup2
THEIR NUMBER TO GET AND. THESE

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:45.775 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO BE IN THERE TO SEE

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:47.744 region:rollup2
THIS AND IT ISN'T THAT IT CAN'T

01:10:45.775 --> 01:10:49.846 region:rollup2
HAPPEN BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE ALL

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:51.314 region:rollup2
THE OLD STUFF AND SAY NOW WE'RE

01:10:49.846 --> 01:10:52.014 region:rollup2
GOING TO DO ALL THIS NEW STUFF.

01:10:51.314 --> 01:10:54.117 region:rollup2
AND THEN WHEN YOU TELL TEACHERS

01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:57.086 region:rollup2
LET'S GET RID OF THE OLD STUFF

01:10:54.117 --> 01:10:58.087 region:rollup2
AND START THE NEW STUFF. THEN

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:58.721 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING MORE AND MORE IN

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:00.690 region:rollup2
TRAINING AND THEY NEVER REALLY

01:10:58.721 --> 01:11:01.390 region:rollup2
GOT IT GET GOOD AT ANYTHING THE

01:11:00.690 --> 01:11:04.260 region:rollup2
TEACHERS THEMSELVES.

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:05.495 region:rollup2
SO I YOU KNOW HAVE FOR MY OWN

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:07.396 region:rollup2
CHILDREN MY LAST WHEN THE

01:11:05.495 --> 01:11:09.632 region:rollup2
GRADUATING FROM CAL STATE THIS

01:11:07.396 --> 01:11:11.400 region:rollup2
THE MASTER. THEY CAME FROM ALL

01:11:09.632 --> 01:11:13.236 region:rollup2
OF THOSE SWINGS YOU NOW FROM

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:15.638 region:rollup2
WHOLE LANGUAGE WHERE CHARTS WERE

01:11:13.236 --> 01:11:16.973 region:rollup2
FALLING OFF THE CLASSROOM WALLS

01:11:15.638 --> 01:11:19.475 region:rollup2
AND EVERYBODY'S READING

01:11:16.973 --> 01:11:21.477 region:rollup2
LITERATURE IN GROUPS AND STUFF

01:11:19.475 --> 01:11:23.212 region:rollup2
TO NOW WE'RE DOING THE WROTE. UP

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:26.015 region:rollup2
WITH WE'VE GOT A NEW PHONICS

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:27.784 region:rollup2
ONLY. AND THAT YOU KNOW BUT

01:11:26.015 --> 01:11:29.418 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I WAS A TEACHER I READ

01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:31.654 region:rollup2
TO THEM FROM THE TIME THEY WERE

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:33.856 region:rollup2
IN PRESCHOOL I HAD EARLY READERS

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:35.625 region:rollup2
IN KINDERGARTEN. BUT IT WAS LIKE

01:11:33.856 --> 01:11:38.528 region:rollup2
THE FIRST FIVE WHERE WE READ WE

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:40.563 region:rollup2
SAYING WE GET BUT AGAIN. NOT

01:11:38.528 --> 01:11:42.198 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY DOES THAT SO

01:11:40.563 --> 01:11:43.199 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING IN HERE THE PIPELINE

01:11:42.198 --> 01:11:45.401 region:rollup2
I DON'T DISAGREE WITH ANY OF IT

01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:47.303 region:rollup2
BUT I GUESS AS THE PANELS GO ON

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:48.838 region:rollup2
AND I HEAR PEOPLE. JUST THAT

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:49.105 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW WE HAVE TO TAKE THE

01:11:48.838 --> 01:11:51.107 region:rollup2
REALITY.

01:11:49.105 --> 01:11:52.708 region:rollup2
WITH WHAT WE WANT.

01:11:51.107 --> 01:11:54.310 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GET

01:11:52.708 --> 01:11:56.412 region:rollup2
THERE I JUST WOULD LOVE TO HAVE

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:57.480 region:rollup2
SOME TEACHERS HERE BECAUSE IT

01:11:56.412 --> 01:11:59.248 region:rollup2
ISN'T THAT THEY SHOULDN'T. I

01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:59.782 region:rollup2
MEAN IN MY OPINION YOU SHOULD

01:11:59.248 --> 01:12:01.417 region:rollup2
SPEND ALL DAY ONE DAY JUST

01:11:59.782 --> 01:12:03.653 region:rollup2
DOING.

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:05.621 region:rollup2
PROJECT BASED LEARNING AND HAVE

01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:07.156 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING OUT ON THE TABLES AND

01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:08.624 region:rollup2
THEY'RE PUTTING THINGS TOGETHER

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:09.725 region:rollup2
IN THEIR FIXING THINGS AND THEN

01:12:08.624 --> 01:12:11.360 region:rollup2
MAYBE A WHOLE NOTHER DAY WE'RE

01:12:09.725 --> 01:12:13.563 region:rollup2
DOING ALL LITERATURE. BUT IF YOU

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:15.965 region:rollup2
GO INTO A CLASSROOM THEY HAVE TO

01:12:13.563 --> 01:12:17.466 region:rollup2
HAVE THE STANDARDS UP AND NOW

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:20.002 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING EMAIL DE AND NOW

01:12:17.466 --> 01:12:21.437 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING OUT P. E. SO. JUST

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:25.274 region:rollup2
KEEP THAT IN MIND HE KEEPS

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:26.409 region:rollup2
SMILING SO I KNOW HE KNOWS

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:27.310 region:rollup2
SOMETHING FFF. AFTER THE IT'S

01:12:26.409 --> 01:12:29.078 region:rollup2
NOT TO BE NEGATIVE I LOVE

01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:33.549 region:rollup2
EDUCATORS I LOVE ALL OF THE

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:34.083 region:rollup2
OPTIONS UP THERE BUT IT'S TO BE

01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:36.852 region:rollup2
PRACTICAL.

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:37.720 region:rollup2
THANK YOU YEAH I THINK THAT.

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:38.955 region:rollup2
SIMILAR KRYSTLE OR ON POINTS

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.923 region:rollup2
OUT. THAT THERE ARE SOMETIMES

01:12:38.955 --> 01:12:43.125 region:rollup2
PRACTICAL BARRIERS THAT NEED TO

01:12:40.923 --> 01:12:43.759 region:rollup2
BE CONSIDERED EVEN WHEN IT COMES

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:44.460 region:rollup2
TO THE BEST RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

01:12:43.759 --> 01:12:45.962 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:47.797 region:rollup2
YEAH AND I CAN'T FORGET THE

01:12:45.962 --> 01:12:49.899 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION THAT SCENE I HAD

01:12:47.797 --> 01:12:51.200 region:rollup2
ABOUT KIDS KEY BEING GIVEN

01:12:49.899 --> 01:12:53.803 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS INCOMPLETE.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:55.137 region:rollup2
BEING GIVEN GREAT COMPUTERS AND

01:12:53.803 --> 01:12:56.772 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO MOUSE TO WORK WITH

01:12:55.137 --> 01:12:58.674 region:rollup2
THE COMPUTER. OF THIS NO

01:12:56.772 --> 01:12:59.108 region:rollup2
KEYBOARD TO THINGS THAT ARE

01:12:58.674 --> 01:13:02.078 region:rollup2
MISSING.

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:03.379 region:rollup2
AND WE OFTEN DO HERE TEACHER

01:13:02.078 --> 01:13:05.615 region:rollup2
SAY THAT IF THEY WERE TO

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:06.749 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT ALL THE REQUIREMENTS

01:13:05.615 --> 01:13:07.717 region:rollup2
THAT COME DOWN FROM THE STATE

01:13:06.749 --> 01:13:09.318 region:rollup2
BOARD OF EDUCATION AND THE

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:11.554 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE. THERE WOULD BE

01:13:09.318 --> 01:13:13.422 region:rollup2
ENOUGH HOURS IN THE DAY TO DO

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:14.924 region:rollup2
THAT AND SO AN ARMY JUST JUMP IN

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:16.626 region:rollup2
AND THE ONE THING THAT REALLY

01:13:14.924 --> 01:13:18.561 region:rollup2
JUMPS OUT AT ME AS A STATE

01:13:16.626 --> 01:13:20.997 region:rollup2
TESTING FOR THIRD GRADE. ART

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:24.267 region:rollup2
REQUIRES THAT THEY ACTUALLY

01:13:20.997 --> 01:13:27.336 region:rollup2
WRITE AN ESSAY ON THE COMPUTER A

01:13:24.267 --> 01:13:28.137 region:rollup2
THREE PARAGRAPH KIND OF WELL PUT

01:13:27.336 --> 01:13:30.273 region:rollup2
TOGETHER ESSAY AT THIRD GRADE.

01:13:28.137 --> 01:13:31.474 region:rollup2
MOST OF I WOULDN'T SAY ALL BUT A

01:13:30.273 --> 01:13:33.342 region:rollup2
GOOD AMOUNT CAN DO THAT AND

01:13:31.474 --> 01:13:35.912 region:rollup2
PAPER AND PENCIL IT'S STILL

01:13:33.342 --> 01:13:38.281 region:rollup2
ROUGH BUT THEY CAN DO IT. BUT A

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:39.015 region:rollup2
GOOD MAJORITY CANNOT DO IT ON

01:13:38.281 --> 01:13:40.917 region:rollup2
THE COMPUTER BECAUSE THEY

01:13:39.015 --> 01:13:42.118 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T HAD ANY TYPE OF

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:43.953 region:rollup2
KEYBOARDING.

01:13:42.118 --> 01:13:46.289 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF THE SCHOOLS AND

01:13:43.953 --> 01:13:47.923 region:rollup2
THEY DO HAVE THE KEYBOARDS.

01:13:46.289 --> 01:13:50.192 region:rollup2
FOR THE TEST BUT THEY SAVED THE

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:51.360 region:rollup2
KEYBOARDS BECAUSE THEY DON'T

01:13:50.192 --> 01:13:52.295 region:rollup2
WANT THEM RUINED.

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.764 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE

01:13:52.295 --> 01:13:56.499 region:rollup2
THE SAME STATE TEST YOU YOU HAVE

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:58.200 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THOSE THINGS SO THEY

01:13:56.499 --> 01:14:00.369 region:rollup2
DON'T GET THE PRACTICE NOW SOME

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:02.471 region:rollup2
OF THE FAMILIES WHO KNOW ABOUT

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:03.873 region:rollup2
THAT LET THEM GO ON LINE AND YOU

01:14:02.471 --> 01:14:05.708 region:rollup2
KNOW WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO

01:14:03.873 --> 01:14:07.043 region:rollup2
THAT BUT AGAIN WE KNOW THERE. IS

01:14:05.708 --> 01:14:09.178 region:rollup2
WHERE THE GREAT DIVIDE HAPPENS I

01:14:07.043 --> 01:14:10.947 region:rollup2
AM THAT SHE MEANT GAP THERE WILL

01:14:09.178 --> 01:14:13.349 region:rollup2
BE FAMILIES THAT WILL PUT HIM ON

01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:13.883 region:rollup2
ONLINE AND AND YOU KNOW HELP

01:14:13.349 --> 01:14:17.119 region:rollup2
THEM LEARN THAT.

01:14:13.883 --> 01:14:19.488 region:rollup2
SO IT IT'S AGAIN THAT ASKING OR

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:20.990 region:rollup2
MAKING OR MANDATING AND THEN THE

01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:22.558 region:rollup2
REALITY.

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:23.859 region:rollup2
SO I'M GONNA RECOMMEND WE DO TWO

01:14:22.558 --> 01:14:25.294 region:rollup2
THINGS ONE.

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:27.263 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND IRE ARE

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:28.731 region:rollup2
GONNA WORK ON SOME THINGS LONG

01:14:27.263 --> 01:14:30.700 region:rollup2
TERM WITH THE STATE BOARD OF

01:14:28.731 --> 01:14:32.134 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND. OUT THERE NEEDS

01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:34.036 region:rollup2
TO BE AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:35.371 region:rollup2
HOW TO IMPLEMENT. ALL OF THESE

01:14:34.036 --> 01:14:38.007 region:rollup2
GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:14:35.371 --> 01:14:38.874 region:rollup2
THE STATE BOARD RECENTLY CAME

01:14:38.007 --> 01:14:42.378 region:rollup2
UP WITH A GREAT.

01:14:38.874 --> 01:14:42.712 region:rollup2
BLUEPRINT IN ANOTHER AREA HOW

01:14:42.378 --> 01:14:45.181 region:rollup2
TO IMPLEMENT.

01:14:42.712 --> 01:14:45.848 region:rollup2
NEW BEST PRACTICES AROUND

01:14:45.181 --> 01:14:47.683 region:rollup2
BILINGUAL EDUCATION.

01:14:45.848 --> 01:14:50.653 region:rollup2
I THINK WE NEED A SIMILAR ROAD

01:14:47.683 --> 01:14:52.054 region:rollup2
MAP FOR MANY TOPICS INCLUDING UP

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:53.889 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO AROUND STEM.

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:54.690 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE SO THAT WE FIGURE

01:14:53.889 --> 01:14:56.959 region:rollup2
OUT HOW TO MANAGE ALL THE

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:59.061 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS AND PROVIDE THESE

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:59.729 region:rollup2
GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS IN WAYS

01:14:59.061 --> 01:15:02.498 region:rollup2
THAT ACTUALLY.

01:14:59.729 --> 01:15:03.232 region:rollup2
CAN BE ACHIEVED FOR STUDENTS

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:05.034 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:15:03.232 --> 01:15:07.670 region:rollup2
THAT'S A LONG TERM WORK THAT'S

01:15:05.034 --> 01:15:08.404 region:rollup2
A LONG TERM HOME ASSIGNMENT I'M

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:09.005 region:rollup2
EXCITED TO WORK WITH THE

01:15:08.404 --> 01:15:09.972 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SUNDAY

01:15:09.005 --> 01:15:10.473 region:rollup2
GONNA BE KEEPIN IT REAL. AND

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:11.440 region:rollup2
BRINGING SOME PRACTICAL

01:15:10.473 --> 01:15:13.242 region:rollup2
INSIGHTS.

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.877 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT YOU'VE EXPERIENCE IN

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:18.214 region:rollup2
THE CLASSROOM TO HELP US REMOVE

01:15:14.877 --> 01:15:18.781 region:rollup2
THE BARRIERS TO GET AWAY OF

01:15:18.214 --> 01:15:19.015 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MAKING THESE THINGS

01:15:18.781 --> 01:15:20.282 region:rollup2
HAPPEN.

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:21.717 region:rollup2
I'LL ASK EACH PANELIST IF YOU

01:15:20.282 --> 01:15:23.252 region:rollup2
HAVE A FOUGHT TO A CORPORATE

01:15:21.717 --> 01:15:24.787 region:rollup2
THAT IN YOUR PRESENTATION.

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:25.855 region:rollup2
IF NOT WE'LL SAVE IT FOR THE

01:15:24.787 --> 01:15:27.056 region:rollup2
QUEUE IN A.

01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:28.958 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:15:27.056 --> 01:15:30.326 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE GET TO THE PANELISTS.

01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:32.261 region:rollup2
MRS STUART VIA IF YOU WANNA

01:15:30.326 --> 01:15:33.262 region:rollup2
JUST A MINUTE TO ADDRESS US SOME

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:35.865 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW WE DO

01:15:33.262 --> 01:15:36.465 region:rollup2
THAT WHILE WE DO THAT AND THEN

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:36.732 region:rollup2
WE'LL MOVE THROUGH THE REST OF

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:38.100 region:rollup2
THE CAMP.

01:15:36.732 --> 01:15:39.735 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY AND AND THANK YOU

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:40.870 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN THURMAN SO I THINK.

01:15:39.735 --> 01:15:42.171 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:43.105 region:rollup2
RAISES SOME VERY VERY GOOD

01:15:42.171 --> 01:15:44.740 region:rollup2
POINTS.

01:15:43.105 --> 01:15:46.208 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK AT LEAST IN MY

01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:48.177 region:rollup2
MIND THAT THIS IS AN EITHER OR

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:49.178 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION I THINK BOB

01:15:48.177 --> 01:15:51.480 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:15:49.178 --> 01:15:53.082 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:54.650 region:rollup2
TEACHERS TKD EIGHT. I THINK IT

01:15:53.082 --> 01:15:56.986 region:rollup2
IS REALLY MORE ABOUT HOW DO WE

01:15:54.650 --> 01:16:00.790 region:rollup2
INTEGRATE OF MATH AND SCIENCE

01:15:56.986 --> 01:16:02.391 region:rollup2
AND STEM. WITH IN E. LA AND AND

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:03.859 region:rollup2
AND MATH QUITE HONESTLY BECAUSE

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:04.860 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT'S WHERE THE FOCUS

01:16:03.859 --> 01:16:07.029 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TESTING.

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:09.098 region:rollup2
SO IT'S IT'S IT'S THAT

01:16:07.029 --> 01:16:09.698 region:rollup2
INTEGRATION AND A HOLISTIC

01:16:09.098 --> 01:16:10.633 region:rollup2
APPROACH AS OPPOSED TO ADDING

01:16:09.698 --> 01:16:11.500 region:rollup2
ON.

01:16:10.633 --> 01:16:12.835 region:rollup2
I ALSO THINK THAT THERE

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:14.637 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

01:16:12.835 --> 01:16:16.005 region:rollup2
OUT OF SCHOOL TIME MANY OF OUR

01:16:14.637 --> 01:16:17.840 region:rollup2
REGIONAL NETWORKS ARE REALLY

01:16:16.005 --> 01:16:19.742 region:rollup2
LEVERAGING WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:21.444 region:rollup2
OF SCHOOL. AND AND AND WORKING

01:16:19.742 --> 01:16:22.411 region:rollup2
HARD TO ENSURE THAT THAT IS

01:16:21.444 --> 01:16:23.813 region:rollup2
CONNECTED STRONGLY TO WHAT'S

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:25.281 region:rollup2
HAPPENING DURING THE SCHOOL DAY

01:16:23.813 --> 01:16:26.882 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S SOME SOME STRONG

01:16:25.281 --> 01:16:29.051 region:rollup2
LINKAGE THERE. AND THEN THERE

01:16:26.882 --> 01:16:29.652 region:rollup2
ALSO INFORMAL OPPORTUNITIES

01:16:29.051 --> 01:16:30.686 region:rollup2
AROUND STEM THAT I THINK COULD

01:16:29.652 --> 01:16:32.521 region:rollup2
BE LEVERAGED.

01:16:30.686 --> 01:16:35.925 region:rollup2
GREAT INTEREST AROUND MAKER

01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:36.492 region:rollup2
SPACES SO I THINK IT IS REALLY

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:36.759 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW DO WE CONNECT THE

01:16:36.492 --> 01:16:39.595 region:rollup2
DOTS.

01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:41.330 region:rollup2
THE MANY OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:44.200 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO US TO TOUCH PARENTS

01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:46.168 region:rollup2
FAMILIES AND AND AND STUDENTS.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:48.737 region:rollup2
SO THAT THEY GET A MUCH.

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:49.972 region:rollup2
BETTER EDUCATION THERE'S

01:16:48.737 --> 01:16:51.273 region:rollup2
GREATER EXPOSURE AND THEY

01:16:49.972 --> 01:16:52.808 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GET TO WHERE THEY NEED

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:53.409 region:rollup2
TO BE IN TERMS OF THEIR UP

01:16:52.808 --> 01:16:54.477 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE AND ACHIEVEMENT SO

01:16:53.409 --> 01:16:55.110 region:rollup2
I%

01:16:54.477 --> 01:16:57.079 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL TIME

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:58.347 region:rollup2
TO RESPOND. OUT THANK YOU KNOW I

01:16:57.079 --> 01:16:59.415 region:rollup2
THINK YOU RAISE A GOOD POINT WE

01:16:58.347 --> 01:17:01.050 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED IT BRIEFLY EARLIER IN

01:16:59.415 --> 01:17:01.383 region:rollup2
THE FIRST PANEL IMPORTANCE OF

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:04.253 region:rollup2
INTEGRATING.

01:17:01.383 --> 01:17:05.855 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SITE CONCEPTS IN IN

01:17:04.253 --> 01:17:06.655 region:rollup2
OTHER ASPECTS OF THE CURRICULUM

01:17:05.855 --> 01:17:07.356 region:rollup2
AND I AGREE IT'S NOT AN EITHER

01:17:06.655 --> 01:17:09.925 region:rollup2
OR.

01:17:07.356 --> 01:17:12.394 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION AND.

01:17:09.925 --> 01:17:14.763 region:rollup2
TO YOUR POINT ABOUT TOM HOW WE

01:17:12.394 --> 01:17:15.297 region:rollup2
USE A NIGHT CLASS TIME.

01:17:14.763 --> 01:17:17.099 region:rollup2
.

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:19.335 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY AND I

01:17:17.099 --> 01:17:20.703 region:rollup2
ARE GOING FORWARD A BILL THAT

01:17:19.335 --> 01:17:22.438 region:rollup2
WOULD FOCUS ON HOW WE PROVIDE

01:17:20.703 --> 01:17:24.273 region:rollup2
MORE STEM SUPPORT DURING THE

THE PRESENTATIONS THAT OCCURRED

01:24:48.984 --> 01:24:52.854 region:rollup2
TODAY. ANDTHE COMMITMENT OF

01:24:50.953 --> 01:24:53.355 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE TO REALLY

01:24:52.854 --> 01:24:55.724 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING A MAJOR MAJOR

01:24:53.355 --> 01:24:57.693 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:24:55.724 --> 01:24:59.461 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK. TO ADDRESS THAT

01:24:57.693 --> 01:25:01.330 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WE ALSO HAVE TO THINK OF

01:24:59.461 --> 01:25:03.932 region:rollup2
ALL THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT

01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:05.834 region:rollup2
HEALTH EDUCATION IS HEALTH. BUT

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:07.569 region:rollup2
WHEN A FAMILY HAS NO ROOF OVER

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:08.837 region:rollup2
THEIR HEAD WHEN THERE'S NO FOOD

01:25:07.569 --> 01:25:10.872 region:rollup2
ON THE TABLE.

01:25:08.837 --> 01:25:12.641 region:rollup2
WHEN THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:13.241 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AT ALL AND WITH

01:25:12.641 --> 01:25:14.843 region:rollup2
THERE'S SO MUCH STRESS PLACED

01:25:13.241 --> 01:25:16.678 region:rollup2
ON.

01:25:14.843 --> 01:25:18.547 region:rollup2
I HAVE DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING

01:25:16.678 --> 01:25:20.082 region:rollup2
HOW WE'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT ALL

01:25:18.547 --> 01:25:22.351 region:rollup2
THE WONDERFUL THINGS WE'VE HEARD

01:25:20.082 --> 01:25:24.353 region:rollup2
TODAY WHICH ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO

01:25:22.351 --> 01:25:26.388 region:rollup2
BE IMPLEMENTED AND HOW IF WE

01:25:24.353 --> 01:25:28.457 region:rollup2
WANT TO ADDRESS EQUITY. THOSE

01:25:26.388 --> 01:25:30.459 region:rollup2
KIDS THAT ARE THE MOST STRESSED

01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:32.628 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO BE THE LEAST LIKELY

01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:34.663 region:rollup2
TO BENEFIT FROM THIS SO I THINK

01:25:32.628 --> 01:25:36.698 region:rollup2
IS WE THINK OF OUR PLAN.

01:25:34.663 --> 01:25:38.767 region:rollup2
OF HOW WE IMPLEMENT THIS WE

01:25:36.698 --> 01:25:40.836 region:rollup2
REALLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. THE

01:25:38.767 --> 01:25:42.637 region:rollup2
KIDS THAT ARE MARGINALIZED IN

01:25:40.836 --> 01:25:44.272 region:rollup2
OUR SOCIETY AND THAT THAT REALLY

01:25:42.637 --> 01:25:45.807 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND

01:25:44.272 --> 01:25:47.376 region:rollup2
BROUGHT INTO THIS.

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:48.910 region:rollup2
DECADES AGO WITH THE NATIONAL

01:25:47.376 --> 01:25:50.345 region:rollup2
INSTITUTES OF HEALTH FUNDED

01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:52.180 region:rollup2
SOMETHING CALLED SCIENCE

01:25:50.345 --> 01:25:54.716 region:rollup2
EDUCATION PARTNERSHIPS

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:56.485 region:rollup2
SEPA AND WE HAD ONE IN OAKLAND.

01:25:54.716 --> 01:25:58.253 region:rollup2
AND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:25:56.485 --> 01:26:00.155 region:rollup2
THE TEACHER'S ROLE I REMEMBER

01:25:58.253 --> 01:26:02.090 region:rollup2
ARE MAJOR ISSUES TEACHERS SAID

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:03.759 region:rollup2
THEY LOVE THIS THEY DON'T HAVE

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:05.293 region:rollup2
ANY TIME IN THE DAY. AND WHEN

01:26:03.759 --> 01:26:07.696 region:rollup2
CAN WE DO THIS AND WAS THERE A

01:26:05.293 --> 01:26:09.164 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT FROM FROM THE HIGHER

01:26:07.696 --> 01:26:10.966 region:rollup2
REPS TO REALLY PRIMITIVISTS SO

01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:12.868 region:rollup2
WE WENT TO AFTER SCHOOL AND WE

01:26:10.966 --> 01:26:15.370 region:rollup2
ALSO SHOWED THAT. PARENTS NEED

01:26:12.868 --> 01:26:17.072 region:rollup2
TO BE PART OF THE WHOLE PROCESS.

01:26:15.370 --> 01:26:18.774 region:rollup2
AND WHEN I CAME IN TODAY I SAW

01:26:17.072 --> 01:26:20.375 region:rollup2
THESE ALL THESE YOUNG CHILDREN

01:26:18.774 --> 01:26:21.677 region:rollup2
RUNNING AROUND DOWNSTAIRS WHERE

01:26:20.375 --> 01:26:24.212 region:rollup2
AND I THOUGHT. THERE ARE

01:26:21.677 --> 01:26:26.481 region:rollup2
PROBABLY NOBEL LAUREATES IN THAT

01:26:24.212 --> 01:26:28.550 region:rollup2
GROUP THEY ARE NEVER GIVEN THE

01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:31.253 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN TO REALLY

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:33.088 region:rollup2
DEVELOP TO WHAT THEY CAN. AND IN

01:26:31.253 --> 01:26:34.956 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE HAD AS

01:26:33.088 --> 01:26:37.259 region:rollup2
PILOT PROJECTS A CHILDREN'S IN

01:26:34.956 --> 01:26:40.395 region:rollup2
OAKLAND WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THE

01:26:37.259 --> 01:26:40.862 region:rollup2
QUALITY OF THOSE CHILDREN. AND

01:26:40.395 --> 01:26:43.065 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE TEENAGERS

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:44.132 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY.

01:26:43.065 --> 01:26:46.268 region:rollup2
IF YOU TRY TO CREATE

01:26:44.132 --> 01:26:47.436 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM. THOSE

01:26:46.268 --> 01:26:48.737 region:rollup2
THAT ARE GOING TO WORK HARDEST

01:26:47.436 --> 01:26:49.771 region:rollup2
ARE THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY

01:26:48.737 --> 01:26:51.206 region:rollup2
WORKING HARD TO SUPPORT THEIR

01:26:49.771 --> 01:26:53.008 region:rollup2
FAMILIES.

01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:54.676 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE TO REALIZE IF YOU

01:26:53.008 --> 01:26:55.811 region:rollup2
HAVE ANOTHER PROGRAM WHAT ARE

01:26:54.676 --> 01:26:57.379 region:rollup2
THEY GOING TO DO FOR THEIR

01:26:55.811 --> 01:26:59.114 region:rollup2
OVERALL TO KEEP THEIR FAMILIES

01:26:57.379 --> 01:27:01.483 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND I THINK IS WE THINK

01:26:59.114 --> 01:27:03.218 region:rollup2
OF THESE NEW EDUCATIONAL THINGS.

01:27:01.483 --> 01:27:05.854 region:rollup2
THERE HAVE TO BE SOME RESOURCES

01:27:03.218 --> 01:27:07.689 region:rollup2
TO DO IT SO WE HAVE A PROGRAM

01:27:05.854 --> 01:27:10.092 region:rollup2
THAT AT OUR RESEARCH INSTITUTE

01:27:07.689 --> 01:27:11.960 region:rollup2
IT'S FUNDED BY THE AND I H. IT'S

01:27:10.092 --> 01:27:13.228 region:rollup2
FINE ADVICE ARM. CALIFORNIANS

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.963 region:rollup2
INTO FOR REGENERATIVE MEDICINE

01:27:13.228 --> 01:27:16.465 region:rollup2
SURROUNDED BY DORIS DUKE IT'S

01:27:14.963 --> 01:27:17.766 region:rollup2
ALL WRITTEN UP IN THE MATERIALS

01:27:16.465 --> 01:27:20.602 region:rollup2
THAT YOU HAVE BUT IT HAS A

01:27:17.766 --> 01:27:22.738 region:rollup2
STIPEND. AND AS FOR UNDERSERVED

01:27:20.602 --> 01:27:24.739 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AND IF IF WE DIDN'T

01:27:22.738 --> 01:27:26.308 region:rollup2
HAVE THE STIPEND THEY COULDN'T

01:27:24.739 --> 01:27:28.310 region:rollup2
TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY. I'M

01:27:26.308 --> 01:27:28.543 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY SUPPORT THEIR

01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:30.212 region:rollup2
FAMILIES

01:27:28.543 --> 01:27:32.114 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THE KIDS THAT THAT

01:27:30.212 --> 01:27:33.548 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO. SAY

01:27:32.114 --> 01:27:35.217 region:rollup2
THERE'S ANOTHER CAREER AND IT'S

01:27:33.548 --> 01:27:37.185 region:rollup2
AMAZING.

01:27:35.217 --> 01:27:38.386 region:rollup2
I CAPABILITIES THEY HAVE AND

01:27:37.185 --> 01:27:39.855 region:rollup2
THEIR HOPE AT THE END OF

01:27:38.386 --> 01:27:41.723 region:rollup2
DECEMBER THAT THEY COULD DO

01:27:39.855 --> 01:27:43.358 region:rollup2
SOMETHING MORE THAN THEY THOUGHT

01:27:41.723 --> 01:27:46.161 region:rollup2
THEY COULD DO BEFORE. AND I

01:27:43.358 --> 01:27:47.529 region:rollup2
THINK OF ALL THE PRESENTATIONS I

01:27:46.161 --> 01:27:49.531 region:rollup2
HEARD TODAY WHICH WERE WONDERFUL

01:27:47.529 --> 01:27:52.033 region:rollup2
HOPE IS ALL PART OF IT. HERE'S

01:27:49.531 --> 01:27:53.468 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE YOUR LIFE

01:27:52.033 --> 01:27:55.537 region:rollup2
BETTER AND I'M I'M REALLY PROUD

01:27:53.468 --> 01:27:56.738 region:rollup2
OF THAT ANOTHER PROGRAM WE HAVE

01:27:55.537 --> 01:27:58.406 region:rollup2
IS IT'S CALLED THE CHAMPS

01:27:56.738 --> 01:27:59.708 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WHERE WE WORK WITH THE

01:27:58.406 --> 01:28:02.844 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND GIVE A

01:27:59.708 --> 01:28:04.112 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY THESE ARE ALL THAT I

01:28:02.844 --> 01:28:06.414 region:rollup2
THINK ATTACHED IN YOUR BROCHURE

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:08.583 region:rollup2
OUT FOR STUDENTS TO GET CREDIT

01:28:06.414 --> 01:28:10.719 region:rollup2
WORKING AT THE HOSPITAL. EYES

01:28:08.583 --> 01:28:12.387 region:rollup2
DOING. MEDICAL THINGS THINKING

01:28:10.719 --> 01:28:13.989 region:rollup2
ABOUT CAREERS IN MEDICINE SO WE

01:28:12.387 --> 01:28:16.358 region:rollup2
HAVE A SCIENCE PROGRAM AND WE

01:28:13.989 --> 01:28:18.026 region:rollup2
HAVE A CAREER PROGRAM.

01:28:16.358 --> 01:28:19.694 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IF YOU TAKE A LOOK

01:28:18.026 --> 01:28:21.329 region:rollup2
AT ALL THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS

01:28:19.694 --> 01:28:23.165 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN

01:28:21.329 --> 01:28:24.766 region:rollup2
THEIR MANY WONDERFUL ONES THEY

01:28:23.165 --> 01:28:25.801 region:rollup2
ALL DO THIS.

01:28:24.766 --> 01:28:26.701 region:rollup2
AND THEY CALL THEM A LITTLE

01:28:25.801 --> 01:28:28.203 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT BUT EVERYBODY HAS A

01:28:26.701 --> 01:28:29.738 region:rollup2
PROGRAM

01:28:28.203 --> 01:28:30.739 region:rollup2
ALL THE UNIVERSITIES HAVE

01:28:29.738 --> 01:28:32.541 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

01:28:30.739 --> 01:28:34.276 region:rollup2
AND IN THE HEALTH SYSTEMS AND

01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:35.911 region:rollup2
ALL THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS WE

01:28:34.276 --> 01:28:37.913 region:rollup2
NEED TO COORDINATE THAT TOGETHER

01:28:35.911 --> 01:28:40.215 region:rollup2
I HEARD SO MANY WONDERFUL THINGS

01:28:37.913 --> 01:28:41.883 region:rollup2
TODAY. THAT IF WE CAN NETWORK

01:28:40.215 --> 01:28:43.919 region:rollup2
THIS WITH YOUR BILL.

01:28:41.883 --> 01:28:45.921 region:rollup2
WE COULD REALLY MAKE THIS STATE

01:28:43.919 --> 01:28:47.355 region:rollup2
THE LEADER IN THE WORLD AND I I

01:28:45.921 --> 01:28:49.257 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO TRY

01:28:47.355 --> 01:28:51.459 region:rollup2
TO ACCOMPLISH. AND I AND I THINK

01:28:49.257 --> 01:28:52.427 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO DO WITH THE TERM YOU

01:28:51.459 --> 01:28:54.062 region:rollup2
USED WHICH.

01:28:52.427 --> 01:28:55.530 region:rollup2
DOCTOR NEVER ARE AND I ARE

01:28:54.062 --> 01:28:56.665 region:rollup2
FACED WITH EVERY DAY IS BEST

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:58.166 region:rollup2
PRACTICE.

01:28:56.665 --> 01:29:00.135 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE BEST PRACTICE TO

01:28:58.166 --> 01:29:02.270 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH THIS AND I THINK WE

01:29:00.135 --> 01:29:04.372 region:rollup2
CAN DO THIS HERE AND I THINK IF

01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:05.640 region:rollup2
YOU TAKE? ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE

01:29:04.372 --> 01:29:07.375 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE HAVE IN THIS

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:09.010 region:rollup2
STATE AND WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING

01:29:07.375 --> 01:29:11.313 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A REALLY REALLY

01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:13.415 region:rollup2
WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY. AND WE

01:29:11.313 --> 01:29:16.284 region:rollup2
NEED TO REALLY ADDRESS MORE THAN

01:29:13.415 --> 01:29:18.186 region:rollup2
JUST EDUCATIONAL GAP IF WE WON

01:29:16.284 --> 01:29:19.888 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL EQUITY.

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:22.157 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT COULD OCCUR

01:29:19.888 --> 01:29:25.093 region:rollup2
IF WE DON'T LOOK AT THINGS LIKE

01:29:22.157 --> 01:29:26.962 region:rollup2
HOUSING FOOD A JOB OPPORTUNITIES

01:29:25.093 --> 01:29:28.496 region:rollup2
I GAVE.

01:29:26.962 --> 01:29:30.031 region:rollup2
THE A I'M NOT PATTING MYSELF HER

01:29:28.496 --> 01:29:32.067 region:rollup2
BETTER HAVE A COUPLE YEARS AGO I

01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:33.268 region:rollup2
WAS FORTUNATE TO GET A TED TALK

01:29:32.067 --> 01:29:34.869 region:rollup2
ON POVERTY IS A DISEASE OF

01:29:33.268 --> 01:29:36.438 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

01:29:34.869 --> 01:29:37.973 region:rollup2
AND IT IT SIDE YOU TO BET IT'S

01:29:36.438 --> 01:29:39.708 region:rollup2
BETTER BETTER REALLY TALKS ABOUT

01:29:37.973 --> 01:29:40.709 region:rollup2
EDUCATION FITTING AND IF YOU

01:29:39.708 --> 01:29:42.711 region:rollup2
DON'T ADDRESS THE POVERTY

01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:44.346 region:rollup2

DOCTOR LEVINE SAYS YOU KNOW KIDS

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:15.737 region:rollup2
HAVE TO HAVE HOPE AND IT REALLY

01:31:13.635 --> 01:31:17.205 region:rollup2
STARTS WITH THE VERY BASICS.

01:31:15.737 --> 01:31:20.375 region:rollup2
WHEN I STARTED TEACHING AT

01:31:17.205 --> 01:31:23.078 region:rollup2
TWENTY. ONE OR TWENTY TWO YEARS

01:31:20.375 --> 01:31:24.579 region:rollup2
OLD I. I ACTUALLY TAUGHT IN

01:31:23.078 --> 01:31:25.680 region:rollup2
PHILLY TEN AT WHAT WE'D CALL

01:31:24.579 --> 01:31:28.350 region:rollup2
HILL SCHOOL IN FULLERTON

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:29.651 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAS HILLS AND AND SO IT

01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:32.053 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE UPPER.

01:31:29.651 --> 01:31:34.956 region:rollup2
TYPE OF SCHOOL WITH THE.

01:31:32.053 --> 01:31:36.024 region:rollup2
OF THE LOT OF FAMILY ENGAGEMENT

01:31:34.956 --> 01:31:37.692 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN

01:31:36.024 --> 01:31:39.394 region:rollup2
AT THAT SCHOOL THERE WASN'T ANY

01:31:37.692 --> 01:31:41.463 region:rollup2
ISSUES AT ALL BUT IT DEFINITELY

01:31:39.394 --> 01:31:43.198 region:rollup2
WOULD MOST OF THE MOMS AT THAT

01:31:41.463 --> 01:31:45.100 region:rollup2
TIME. YOU KNOW IN THE EIGHTIES

01:31:43.198 --> 01:31:47.002 region:rollup2
WERE STAYING HOME AND SO HOLD

01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:49.471 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT. AND THEN

01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:51.506 region:rollup2
I CHOSE TO TO MOVE TO THE SCHOOL

01:31:49.471 --> 01:31:54.008 region:rollup2
I ACTUALLY ATTENDED IN FULLERTON

01:31:51.506 --> 01:31:55.777 region:rollup2
A WHICH IS A TITLE ONE SCHOOL

01:31:54.008 --> 01:31:57.779 region:rollup2
AND SPENT MOST OF MY UP YEARS

01:31:55.777 --> 01:31:59.781 region:rollup2
TEACHING THERE. AND WHEN I FIRST

01:31:57.779 --> 01:32:01.316 region:rollup2
STARTED TEACHING MY WHOLE KIND

01:31:59.781 --> 01:32:03.284 region:rollup2
OF PASSION FOR TEACHING WAS

01:32:01.316 --> 01:32:05.954 region:rollup2
ABOUT CREATIVITY IT WAS ABOUT.

01:32:03.284 --> 01:32:08.923 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT I LIKE TO DO

01:32:05.954 --> 01:32:12.727 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT BE OUR TOUR LIKE I

01:32:08.923 --> 01:32:16.097 region:rollup2
SAID VIETNAM. BIG CINEMATIC

01:32:12.727 --> 01:32:20.969 region:rollup2
THINGS ON LITERATURE RAN AND

01:32:16.097 --> 01:32:23.271 region:rollup2
WRITING AND AND YOU KNOW AND AND

01:32:20.969 --> 01:32:26.041 region:rollup2
MAYBE I WEAVER DURING THE MASS

01:32:23.271 --> 01:32:29.511 region:rollup2
OUR WAY SO YOU KNOW I REALLY

01:32:26.041 --> 01:32:31.279 region:rollup2
ENJOYED THAT TOO. BUT THERE WERE

01:32:29.511 --> 01:32:33.314 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON IN

01:32:31.279 --> 01:32:35.784 region:rollup2
EDUCATION WE DIDN'T HAVE

01:32:33.314 --> 01:32:38.119 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS THIRTY YEARS AGO

01:32:35.784 --> 01:32:40.522 region:rollup2
ABOUT ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND THINGS

01:32:38.119 --> 01:32:42.190 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT. WHEN I MOVE BACK TO

01:32:40.522 --> 01:32:44.159 region:rollup2
THE SCHOOL THAT I HAD ACTUALLY

01:32:42.190 --> 01:32:46.728 region:rollup2
GONE TO.

01:32:44.159 --> 01:32:48.263 region:rollup2
OF COURSE IT WAS A WHOLE

01:32:46.728 --> 01:32:53.535 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

01:32:48.263 --> 01:32:54.069 region:rollup2
ISSUE AND EVEN THOUGH THOSE.

01:32:53.535 --> 01:32:54.702 region:rollup2
IT DEMOCRATS AS WERE VERY

01:32:54.069 --> 01:32:56.271 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO ME I LEARNED VERY

01:32:54.702 --> 01:32:57.505 region:rollup2
QUICKLY THAT IF A KID OR A

01:32:56.271 --> 01:32:58.106 region:rollup2
STUDENT HAS AN ABSCESS BECAUSE

01:32:57.505 --> 01:32:59.007 region:rollup2
THEY HAVEN'T HAD DENTAL CARE.

01:32:58.106 --> 01:32:59.641 region:rollup2
OR LIKE YOU SAY THEY DON'T KNOW

01:32:59.007 --> 01:33:03.044 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY'RE SLEEPING. ARM AT

01:32:59.641 --> 01:33:04.879 region:rollup2
NIGHT LOW'S ARE ALL THINGS THAT

01:33:03.044 --> 01:33:06.714 region:rollup2
HAPPEN IN THEIR DAY BEFORE YOU

01:33:04.879 --> 01:33:08.083 region:rollup2
EVEN GET TO THE CURRICULUM.

01:33:06.714 --> 01:33:10.652 region:rollup2
BEFORE YOU EVEN GET TO THE BEST

01:33:08.083 --> 01:33:12.020 region:rollup2
PRACTICES. AND WAY BACK TWENTY

01:33:10.652 --> 01:33:13.822 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO SOME OF YOU MIGHT

01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:14.923 region:rollup2
REMEMBER THERE WAS A GRANT.

01:33:13.822 --> 01:33:16.424 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE STATE CALLED HEALTHY

01:33:14.923 --> 01:33:19.294 region:rollup2
START

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:21.863 region:rollup2
AND THIS THIS GRANT WAS REALLY.

01:33:19.294 --> 01:33:23.364 region:rollup2
FORM TO MAKE CONNECTIONS WITH

01:33:21.863 --> 01:33:24.666 region:rollup2
IN YOUR DISTRICT SO WHAT WHETHER

01:33:23.364 --> 01:33:26.367 region:rollup2
IT BE BUSINESS.

01:33:24.666 --> 01:33:28.169 region:rollup2
OR OTHER CONNECTIONS THAT

01:33:26.367 --> 01:33:30.672 region:rollup2
DIDN'T START A NEW PROGRAM THAT

01:33:28.169 --> 01:33:32.240 region:rollup2
BUT YOU WOULD BE A LIAISON IN

01:33:30.672 --> 01:33:33.975 region:rollup2
YOUR COMMUNITY TO GO OUT.

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:35.343 region:rollup2
AND MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS SO

01:33:33.975 --> 01:33:36.611 region:rollup2
ONE CONNECTION WE MADE IN IN

01:33:35.343 --> 01:33:38.346 region:rollup2
FULLERTON WAS SOUTHERN

01:33:36.611 --> 01:33:40.114 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SCHOOL OF OPTOMETRY

01:33:38.346 --> 01:33:41.216 region:rollup2
WAS RIGHT THERE. SO WE WERE ABLE

01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:44.319 region:rollup2
TO CONNECT

01:33:41.216 --> 01:33:46.120 region:rollup2
THEM TO DO EYEGLASS EXAMS AND SO

01:33:44.319 --> 01:33:48.189 region:rollup2
SURE ENOUGH WHAT DID WE FIND OUT

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:50.091 region:rollup2
THAT A LOT OF OUR FIRST GRADERS

01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:52.193 region:rollup2
NEEDED GLASSES AND WORK. SO IT

01:33:50.091 --> 01:33:53.528 region:rollup2
WAS KIND OF GOING BACKWARDS IN

01:33:52.193 --> 01:33:56.264 region:rollup2
DOING SOME OF THE HOLISTIC

01:33:53.528 --> 01:33:58.299 region:rollup2
ISSUES OUT WE WEE ABLE TO BUILD

01:33:56.264 --> 01:34:00.468 region:rollup2
A HEALTH CLINIC RIGHT BEHIND OUR

01:33:58.299 --> 01:34:01.469 region:rollup2
SKILL SCHOOL BECAUSE THEN I WENT

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:03.137 region:rollup2
ON CITY COUNCIL ON I REALIZED

01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:04.873 region:rollup2
HEY. WE CAN GET THINGS DONE WE

01:34:03.137 --> 01:34:07.108 region:rollup2
PUT LIGHTING AND SO THAT THE

01:34:04.873 --> 01:34:09.043 region:rollup2
KIDS COULD DO SOCCER AFTER

01:34:07.108 --> 01:34:10.478 region:rollup2
SCHOOL THAT THE CITY PAID AND IT

01:34:09.043 --> 01:34:13.214 region:rollup2
WAS A PARTNERSHIP.

01:34:10.478 --> 01:34:15.450 region:rollup2
BUT IT WHAT REMAINS IS SOME

01:34:13.214 --> 01:34:17.218 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THINK HOLISTICALLY OR.

01:34:15.450 --> 01:34:19.053 region:rollup2
I'M I'M DEATHLY KIND LIKE A

01:34:17.218 --> 01:34:20.855 region:rollup2
HOLISTIC KIND OF PERSON AND THEN

01:34:19.053 --> 01:34:22.690 region:rollup2
OTHERS BECAUSE OF THE TRAINING

01:34:20.855 --> 01:34:24.192 region:rollup2
OR BECAUSE OF WHATEVER THEY SEE

01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:25.527 region:rollup2
THEIR LANDS THROUGH MIGHT SAY

01:34:24.192 --> 01:34:27.128 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT MY JOB.

01:34:25.527 --> 01:34:29.264 region:rollup2
THAT'S A SOCIAL THING WE DON'T

01:34:27.128 --> 01:34:30.765 region:rollup2
DO SOCIAL THINGS WE DON'T HAVE

01:34:29.264 --> 01:34:33.835 region:rollup2
COUNSELORS ON SCHOOLS WE DON'T.

01:34:30.765 --> 01:34:35.570 region:rollup2
IT ISN'T OUR JOB TO ASK

01:34:33.835 --> 01:34:37.238 region:rollup2
THOSE KIND OF QUESTIONS AND

01:34:35.570 --> 01:34:39.073 region:rollup2
LATER EVEN ALLOW UP TO THE LAST

01:34:37.238 --> 01:34:40.875 region:rollup2
FEW YEARS OF TEACHING WHICH IT

01:34:39.073 --> 01:34:42.210 region:rollup2
WAS ONLY FOR ME IS. LESS THAN IT

01:34:40.875 --> 01:34:44.546 region:rollup2
ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO.

01:34:42.210 --> 01:34:46.581 region:rollup2
ONE I'D HAVE STUDENT PARENT

01:34:44.546 --> 01:34:47.815 region:rollup2
CONFERENCES IT WOULD ALWAYS USED

01:34:46.581 --> 01:34:49.517 region:rollup2
TO BE YOU WOULD TELL THEM HOW

01:34:47.815 --> 01:34:51.052 region:rollup2
THEY WERE DOING IN SCHOOL.

01:34:49.517 --> 01:34:52.186 region:rollup2
AND THEN IT BECAME THIS WHOLE

01:34:51.052 --> 01:34:53.421 region:rollup2
THING OF JUST GIVEN THE SCORES

01:34:52.186 --> 01:34:56.124 region:rollup2
AND ALL THIS STUFF.

01:34:53.421 --> 01:34:57.425 region:rollup2
BUT MY LAST FEW YEARS I DIDN'T

01:34:56.124 --> 01:34:59.794 region:rollup2
DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS I TOOK

01:34:57.425 --> 01:35:02.363 region:rollup2
OUT A NOTEBOOK AND ASKED THEM.

01:34:59.794 --> 01:35:04.599 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS GOING ON BECAUSE OVER

01:35:02.363 --> 01:35:06.367 region:rollup2
AN OVER THE PARTICULARLY IN THE

HOMELESS WE HAD PARENTS WHO

01:35:11.439 --> 01:35:15.343 region:rollup2
WEREN'T GETTING HEALTH CARE WE

01:35:12.974 --> 01:35:16.911 region:rollup2
HAD A DREAMER KIDS WHO WERE

01:35:15.343 --> 01:35:18.313 region:rollup2
OLDER STUDENTS OF MINE NOW

01:35:16.911 --> 01:35:20.381 region:rollup2
TRYING TO GO TO COLLEGE AND I

01:35:18.313 --> 01:35:21.482 region:rollup2
WOULD JUST WRITE THIS LIST. AND

01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:23.551 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I HAD BEEN THE HEALTHY

01:35:21.482 --> 01:35:25.119 region:rollup2
START COMPORTED NADER AS A

01:35:23.551 --> 01:35:26.554 region:rollup2

DO CHANGE

01:35:31.426 --> 01:35:35.230 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AND THEN THEY'RE FREED

01:35:33.194 --> 01:35:37.098 region:rollup2
UP FROM ALL THIS ANXIETY OF A

01:35:35.230 --> 01:35:39.667 region:rollup2

THINGS HAVE BEEN RECTIFIED WITH

01:35:51.379 --> 01:35:55.883 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATION. NOW TEACHERS

ARGUABLY AS HAS BEEN STATED IN

01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:36.757 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE REGIONS THAT IS MOST

01:41:34.889 --> 01:41:38.526 region:rollup2
DENSELY POPULATED WITH CAREERS

01:41:36.757 --> 01:41:40.595 region:rollup2
IN TECHNOLOGY SCIENCE. AND

ILLUSTRATES SOME OF THOSE

01:42:02.984 --> 01:42:05.786 region:rollup2
BARRIERS.

01:42:04.752 --> 01:42:07.722 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT AND WERE IT NOT FOR

01:42:05.786 --> 01:42:08.255 region:rollup2
MY FAMILY AND MY COMMUNITY

01:42:07.722 --> 01:42:09.957 region:rollup2
SUPPORT I WOULDN'T BE HERE

01:42:08.255 --> 01:42:11.792 region:rollup2
TODAY.

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:13.194 region:rollup2
I WAS BORN IN MOBILE ALABAMA

01:42:11.792 --> 01:42:15.396 region:rollup2
DURING THE NATIONAL SHAME OF JIM

01:42:13.194 --> 01:42:16.764 region:rollup2
CROW SEGREGATION.

01:42:15.396 --> 01:42:18.699 region:rollup2
FORTUNATELY WE MOVE TO

01:42:16.764 --> 01:42:20.568 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WHERE I COMPLETED K.

01:42:18.699 --> 01:42:21.102 region:rollup2
THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION HERE IN

01:42:20.568 --> 01:42:22.403 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO COUNTY IN NORTH

01:42:21.102 --> 01:42:24.238 region:rollup2
HIGHLANDS.

01:42:22.403 --> 01:42:25.873 region:rollup2
AND I WAS AN EXCELLENT STUDENT

01:42:24.238 --> 01:42:26.874 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL IN MATH AND SCIENCE

01:42:25.873 --> 01:42:29.210 region:rollup2
BUT I WAS ENCOURAGED.

01:42:26.874 --> 01:42:30.444 region:rollup2
FACT.

01:42:29.210 --> 01:42:31.712 region:rollup2
ONE TEACHER SAID YOU'RE YOU ARE

01:42:30.444 --> 01:42:33.381 region:rollup2
REALLY SMART YOU COULD BE A

01:42:31.712 --> 01:42:34.882 region:rollup2
GREAT EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT AND

01:42:33.381 --> 01:42:37.752 region:rollup2
HAD ME TAKING SHORTHAND AND

01:42:34.882 --> 01:42:38.352 region:rollup2
TYPING WHICH I USED WHEN THEY IN

01:42:37.752 --> 01:42:39.153 region:rollup2
MEDICAL SCHOOL AS I WAS TAKING

01:42:38.352 --> 01:42:41.589 region:rollup2
NOTES.

01:42:39.153 --> 01:42:43.190 region:rollup2
BUT DESPITE THAT I REALLY I

01:42:41.589 --> 01:42:45.559 region:rollup2
FOUND MY WAY.

01:42:43.190 --> 01:42:46.727 region:rollup2
AND TEACHERS AND COUNSELORS WITH

01:42:45.559 --> 01:42:48.062 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN UNCONSCIOUS BIAS YOU

01:42:46.727 --> 01:42:49.363 region:rollup2
KNOW THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT

01:42:48.062 --> 01:42:50.498 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE THIRD GRADE

01:42:49.363 --> 01:42:52.133 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY FOR BLACK MEN.

01:42:50.498 --> 01:42:53.467 region:rollup2
TEACHERS

01:42:52.133 --> 01:42:55.302 region:rollup2
I HAVE BEEN COURAGEOUS BIASES

01:42:53.467 --> 01:42:56.804 region:rollup2
AGAINST OUR KIDS AND SO IN THE

01:42:55.302 --> 01:42:58.372 region:rollup2
CONTEXT OF TEACHING.

01:42:56.804 --> 01:43:00.408 region:rollup2
ABOUT STEM PEOPLE HAVE

01:42:58.372 --> 01:43:02.677 region:rollup2
PRECONCEIVED BIASES ABOUT WHO'S

01:43:00.408 --> 01:43:05.913 region:rollup2
GONNA SIX SALAR SUCCEED IN THESE

01:43:02.677 --> 01:43:08.249 region:rollup2
AREAS AND WHO WHAT WHO WILL NOT.

01:43:05.913 --> 01:43:10.851 region:rollup2
I HAD THE BENEFIT A. OF A

01:43:08.249 --> 01:43:12.920 region:rollup2
PERSISTENT I MOTHER WHO ACTUALLY

01:43:10.851 --> 01:43:14.555 region:rollup2
BAT REALLY HELPED ME TO

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:16.524 region:rollup2
PERSEVERE AND AYE I DEVELOPED

01:43:14.555 --> 01:43:18.759 region:rollup2
THAT PERSEVERANCE ALONG THE WAY.

01:43:16.524 --> 01:43:21.228 region:rollup2
AND.

01:43:18.759 --> 01:43:22.863 region:rollup2
WITHOUT HAVING HAD A ROLE MODEL

01:43:21.228 --> 01:43:25.366 region:rollup2
I HAD NEVER SEEN A BLACK WOMAN

01:43:22.863 --> 01:43:26.934 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN I HAD NO ROLE MODELS I

01:43:25.366 --> 01:43:29.370 region:rollup2
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE PATHWAYS TO

01:43:26.934 --> 01:43:30.471 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY. GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL.

01:43:29.370 --> 01:43:32.239 region:rollup2
SO I FOUND MY WAY TO PHARMACY

01:43:30.471 --> 01:43:33.741 region:rollup2
SCHOOL.

01:43:32.239 --> 01:43:35.142 region:rollup2
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL I WAS IN A

01:43:33.741 --> 01:43:37.311 region:rollup2
SENIOR POSITION OF PHARMACY

01:43:35.142 --> 01:43:39.380 region:rollup2
SCHOOL THAT I SAW MY FIRST HAND

01:43:37.311 --> 01:43:40.948 region:rollup2
THE ROLE OF A PHYSICIAN AND

01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:42.483 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE TEAM AND I.

01:43:40.948 --> 01:43:44.585 region:rollup2
WHAT REALIZE THAT THAT WHOLE

01:43:42.483 --> 01:43:46.253 region:rollup2
HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO DO THAT I

01:43:44.585 --> 01:43:48.089 region:rollup2
GAINED CONFIDENCE THAT I? HAD

01:43:46.253 --> 01:43:50.024 region:rollup2
LACKED BEFORE.

01:43:48.089 --> 01:43:52.760 region:rollup2
SO WITHOUT ROLE MODELS WITHOUT

01:43:50.024 --> 01:43:54.929 region:rollup2
MENTORS WITHOUT A PATH THAT

01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:57.031 region:rollup2
COULD BE EASILY NAVIGATED IT WAS

01:43:54.929 --> 01:43:57.932 region:rollup2
CIRCUITOUS FOR ME TO FIND MY WAY

01:43:57.031 --> 01:44:00.000 region:rollup2
AND THESE.

01:43:57.932 --> 01:44:02.403 region:rollup2
KINDS OF INEQUITIES REALLY

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:05.005 region:rollup2
PERPETUATE TODAY THEIR BARRIERS

01:44:02.403 --> 01:44:06.373 region:rollup2
THAT PERPETUITY INEQUITIES.

01:44:05.005 --> 01:44:07.341 region:rollup2
MANY YEARS LATER I NEVER WOULD

01:44:06.373 --> 01:44:08.743 region:rollup2
HAVE ENVISIONED THAT IN TWO

01:44:07.341 --> 01:44:10.177 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND TEN I WOULD BECOME

01:44:08.743 --> 01:44:11.579 region:rollup2
THE FIRST.

01:44:10.177 --> 01:44:13.347 region:rollup2
AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN TO EVER

01:44:11.579 --> 01:44:14.415 region:rollup2
BE A VICE CHANCELLOR. AT THE

01:44:13.347 --> 01:44:16.217 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN

FRANCISCO HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:44:16.217 --> 01:44:19.386 region:rollup2
YEARS HISTORY.

01:44:17.785 --> 01:44:21.756 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOU ASK YOURSELF WHY SO

01:44:19.386 --> 01:44:23.224 region:rollup2
SLOW YEAH. WHILE.

01:44:21.756 --> 01:44:24.525 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW FOR YOU FIND THAT

01:44:23.224 --> 01:44:26.627 region:rollup2
LITTLE HAS CHANGED IN THIRTY

01:44:24.525 --> 01:44:28.729 region:rollup2
YEARS STEM CAREERS IN THE U. S.

01:44:26.627 --> 01:44:30.064 region:rollup2
CONTINUED TO LACK THE DIVERSITY.

01:44:28.729 --> 01:44:31.532 region:rollup2
THE PERCENTAGE OF AFRICAN

AMERICANS EMPLOYED INSTANT

01:44:31.532 --> 01:44:36.470 region:rollup2
CAREERS HASN'T CHANGED OVER THE

01:44:33.901 --> 01:44:38.205 region:rollup2
PAST THREE DECADES.

01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:39.740 region:rollup2
WE FIND HAS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

01:44:38.205 --> 01:44:42.076 region:rollup2
EARLIER THAT THE EDUCATIONAL

01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:44.044 region:rollup2
GAPS BEGAN SO EARLY IN MATH.

01:44:42.076 --> 01:44:45.513 region:rollup2
WITH MATH BEING A PREDICTOR AND

01:44:44.044 --> 01:44:47.882 region:rollup2
THAT THESE DISCREPANCIES

01:44:45.513 --> 01:44:49.416 region:rollup2
CONTINUE PERSISTENT EXPAND. OVER

01:44:47.882 --> 01:44:50.918 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:44:49.416 --> 01:44:52.419 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY ONLY TWENTY NINE

01:44:50.918 --> 01:44:54.121 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN

01:44:52.419 --> 01:44:56.223 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF HISPANIC

STUDENTS.

01:45:03.964 --> 01:45:06.734 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS REGIONAL

01:45:04.798 --> 01:45:08.802 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION TO EXPAND AND

01:45:06.734 --> 01:45:11.472 region:rollup2
STRENGTHEN STEM THE UNIVERSITY

01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:25.252 region:rollup2
AS WITH YOU THAN THEIR FAMILIES

01:45:24.218 --> 01:45:26.554 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES.

01:45:25.252 --> 01:45:28.589 region:rollup2
TO REALLY IDENTIFY AND PROMOTE

01:45:26.554 --> 01:45:30.191 region:rollup2
THE CHANGES NECESSARY TO CREATE

01:45:28.589 --> 01:45:31.659 region:rollup2
A SEAMLESS SYSTEM CREATING THAT

01:45:30.191 --> 01:45:33.427 region:rollup2
PATHWAY.

01:45:31.659 --> 01:45:34.895 region:rollup2
AND AS WE'VE HEARD ONE OF THE

01:45:33.427 --> 01:45:37.131 region:rollup2
MOST IMPORTANT FINDINGS FOR

01:45:34.895 --> 01:45:39.099 region:rollup2
UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS

01:45:37.131 --> 01:45:41.368 region:rollup2
IS THAT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO

01:45:39.099 --> 01:45:43.270 region:rollup2
PURSUE A STEM CAREER. IF AT AN

01:45:41.368 --> 01:45:44.638 region:rollup2
EARLY AGE THEY SEE PEOPLE WHO

01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:46.607 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE THEM.

01:45:44.638 --> 01:45:47.174 region:rollup2
THEY'RE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND

01:45:46.607 --> 01:45:49.710 region:rollup2
THEIR SOLVING PROBLEMS WITH

01:45:47.174 --> 01:45:51.712 region:rollup2
STEM.

01:45:49.710 --> 01:45:52.947 region:rollup2
SO WE KNOW THAT WE NEED SOME

01:45:51.712 --> 01:45:55.282 region:rollup2
INTENTIONALITY FOR THESE

01:45:52.947 --> 01:45:56.984 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES WE HAVE

01:45:55.282 --> 01:45:59.186 region:rollup2
TO START EARLY WE HAVE TO CREATE

01:45:56.984 --> 01:46:00.621 region:rollup2
AND CURATE THEIR CURIOSITY AND

01:45:59.186 --> 01:46:01.989 region:rollup2
INTEREST WE HAVE TO HAVE

01:46:00.621 --> 01:46:03.490 region:rollup2
ENGAGING ACTIVITIES.

01:46:01.989 --> 01:46:04.692 region:rollup2
FOR THEM WITHIN THEIR

01:46:03.490 --> 01:46:06.393 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND FOR THEIR

01:46:04.692 --> 01:46:08.796 region:rollup2
FAMILIES WE HAVE TO CREATE A

01:46:06.393 --> 01:46:10.464 region:rollup2
CULTURE THAT'S WELCOMING

01:46:08.796 --> 01:46:12.967 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE AND FOSTERS A

01:46:10.464 --> 01:46:15.336 region:rollup2
POSITIVE SELF IMAGE FOR STUDENTS

01:46:12.967 --> 01:46:15.936 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE TEACHER DEVELOPMENT.

01:46:15.336 --> 01:46:17.972 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO

01:46:15.936 --> 01:46:19.506 region:rollup2
WE.

01:46:17.972 --> 01:46:22.009 region:rollup2
BREAK DOWN THESE BARRIERS THESE

01:46:19.506 --> 01:46:22.610 region:rollup2
UNCONSCIOUS BIAS BARRIERS THAT.

01:46:22.009 --> 01:46:24.745 region:rollup2
REALLY.

01:46:22.610 --> 01:46:27.248 region:rollup2
FOSTER THE STEREOTYPE THREAT

01:46:24.745 --> 01:46:29.717 region:rollup2
THAT OFTEN OF MINORITIES FEEL.

01:46:27.248 --> 01:46:31.185 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE IN THESE FIELDS.

01:46:29.717 --> 01:46:32.753 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO OFFER THE HANDS ON

01:46:31.185 --> 01:46:35.322 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES WITHIN THE FELL OF

01:46:32.753 --> 01:46:36.557 region:rollup2
THE FIELD AND WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:46:35.322 --> 01:46:38.959 region:rollup2
INFORMAL LEARNING DE.

01:46:36.557 --> 01:46:40.394 region:rollup2
KEEP THESE ARE KEY TO REALLY

01:46:38.959 --> 01:46:41.929 region:rollup2

WE THINK ABOUT THAT WE'RE

01:46:44.465 --> 01:46:48.102 region:rollup2
WORKING IN THE BOYS AND GIRLS

01:46:45.599 --> 01:46:50.004 region:rollup2
CLUBS AND. IN THE YMCA TO REALLY

BRING THE SCIENCE EDUCATION TO

01:46:50.004 --> 01:46:54.141 region:rollup2
THOSE PROGRAMS THIS WHILE. WE

01:46:51.839 --> 01:46:55.509 region:rollup2
HAVE TO PROVIDE STEM MENTORS AND

01:46:54.141 --> 01:46:57.778 region:rollup2
NETWORKS THAT ARE CULTURALLY

01:46:55.509 --> 01:46:59.747 region:rollup2
ALIGNED. AGAIN YOU NEED TO SEE

01:46:57.778 --> 01:47:00.814 region:rollup2
OURSELVES IN THESE ROLES WE HAVE

01:46:59.747 --> 01:47:03.083 region:rollup2
TO EDUCATE AND ENGAGE OUR

01:47:00.814 --> 01:47:04.652 region:rollup2
FAMILIES ON THE DIMMER DIVERSE

01:47:03.083 --> 01:47:06.020 region:rollup2
AND EMERGING STEM CAREERS. AS

01:47:04.652 --> 01:47:07.688 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FAMILIES ARE SO

01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:08.455 region:rollup2
CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS STUDENT

HIRING ENGIEERING TAX

01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:32.019 region:rollup2
BUT THAT THE VETS A HAD NOT HAD

01:51:29.349 --> 01:51:33.420 region:rollup2
THE EXPERIENCE OF. OF BEING ABLE

01:51:32.019 --> 01:51:34.188 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THE ACCELERATED MATH

01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:36.490 region:rollup2
THAT WAS NEEDED FOR THIS

01:51:34.188 --> 01:51:37.858 region:rollup2
POSITION SO THE COLLEGE WAS

01:51:36.490 --> 01:51:39.459 region:rollup2
FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO CREATE THAT.

01:51:37.858 --> 01:51:41.528 region:rollup2
AND NOW WE HAVE A ROBUST

PROGRAM AND WE WERE ALL ABLE TO

01:51:41.528 --> 01:51:46.033 region:rollup2
BRING OTHER FINALISTS FROM OUR

HAVE A POOL OF EMPLOYERS WHO ARE

01:51:47.768 --> 01:51:49.703 region:rollup2
HIRING FROM THIS TRAINING

01:51:48.569 --> 01:51:51.471 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:51:49.703 --> 01:51:53.840 region:rollup2
WE SEE THIS AS A MODEL OF

01:51:51.471 --> 01:51:55.776 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY WITH OUR EDUCATORS

01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:57.344 region:rollup2
PREPARING PEOPLE FOR WORK AND

01:51:55.776 --> 01:51:59.646 region:rollup2
THEN PULLING ARM PLAYERS

01:51:57.344 --> 01:52:00.714 region:rollup2
TOGETHER FOR HIRING. ANOTHER WAY

01:51:59.646 --> 01:52:02.783 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:52:00.714 --> 01:52:04.051 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING

01:52:02.783 --> 01:52:06.954 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THE MILLIONS

01:52:04.051 --> 01:52:08.655 region:rollup2
OF DOLLARS THAT. OF ANY OFF CAN

01:52:06.954 --> 01:52:10.090 region:rollup2
BUT THEY CAN OPEN THEIR DOORS SO

01:52:08.655 --> 01:52:11.558 region:rollup2
THEIR OPENING THEIR DOORS THEY

01:52:10.090 --> 01:52:13.360 region:rollup2
REALIZED THAT THERE ARE MANY

01:52:11.558 --> 01:52:15.629 region:rollup2
INFLUENCERS IN A YOUNG PERSON'S

01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:17.631 region:rollup2

MEMBERS ARE. INFLUENCERS WE KNOW

01:52:20.234 --> 01:52:25.372 region:rollup2
THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE WE

SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE

01:52:33.914 --> 01:52:37.751 region:rollup2
MESSAGING TO PROMOTE STEM

01:52:35.682 --> 01:52:39.519 region:rollup2
THROUGH THOSE INFLUENCERS IS

01:52:37.751 --> 01:52:41.388 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL. WILL

WITH THEM AT CAREER STEM

01:52:53.066 --> 01:52:58.405 region:rollup2
AWARENESS WE WANT THE EMPLOYEES

01:52:55.469 --> 01:52:59.806 region:rollup2
WHO ARE YOUNGER. CREW CAME FROM

01:52:58.405 --> 01:53:01.074 region:rollup2
INNER CITY NEIGHBORHOODS THAT

01:52:59.806 --> 01:53:02.843 region:rollup2
LOOKED LIKE THEM THAN WE HAVE

01:53:01.074 --> 01:53:04.378 region:rollup2
TAUGHT TUESDAY MATH PIERCINGS

01:53:02.843 --> 01:53:07.114 region:rollup2
BUT THE STUDENTS CAN RELATE TO

01:53:04.378 --> 01:53:07.581 region:rollup2

LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER SO

01:56:10.831 --> 01:56:14.301 region:rollup2

I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY

01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:50.390 region:rollup2
EASY FOR US TO DO.

01:58:48.054 --> 01:58:51.358 region:rollup2
I ANYTHING FURTHER FROM THE

01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:53.026 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE A ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:58:51.358 --> 01:58:54.894 region:rollup2
QUIRK SILVA.

01:58:53.026 --> 01:58:56.463 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK WHEN I CAME AND I

01:58:54.894 --> 01:58:58.698 region:rollup2
WAS EXPECTING TO BE THINKING

01:58:56.463 --> 01:58:59.265 region:rollup2
ABOUT STEM.

01:58:58.698 --> 01:59:01.534 region:rollup2
AS THAT'S THE TITLE OR DOING

01:58:59.265 --> 01:59:03.503 region:rollup2
AND.

01:59:01.534 --> 01:59:05.372 region:rollup2
BUT IT REALLY DOES REMIND ME

01:59:03.503 --> 01:59:07.374 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY OF GOING BACKWARDS AND

01:59:05.372 --> 01:59:08.975 region:rollup2
I MANAGED IT OFF HAND BUT I

01:59:07.374 --> 01:59:10.577 region:rollup2
THINK IT COULD ACTUALLY BE A

01:59:08.975 --> 01:59:12.879 region:rollup2
SOLUTION TO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

01:59:10.577 --> 01:59:14.748 region:rollup2
ABOUT IS. TWENTY TWENTY YEARS

01:59:12.879 --> 01:59:16.149 region:rollup2
AGO IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:59:14.748 --> 01:59:18.184 region:rollup2
THE STATE ACTUALLY FUNDED

01:59:16.149 --> 01:59:19.919 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN

01:59:18.184 --> 01:59:21.888 region:rollup2
THROUGH A GRANT PROCESS. A

01:59:19.919 --> 01:59:23.189 region:rollup2
HEALTHY START COORDINATOR. AND

01:59:21.888 --> 01:59:26.292 region:rollup2
THE HEALTHY START COORDINATOR

01:59:23.189 --> 01:59:28.361 region:rollup2
LIKE I SAID WE'RE NOT FOCUSED ON

01:59:26.292 --> 01:59:29.963 region:rollup2
STARTING A NEW PROGRAM IT WAS

01:59:28.361 --> 01:59:31.264 region:rollup2
MAKING THOSE CONNECTIONS WITHIN

01:59:29.963 --> 01:59:35.201 region:rollup2
THEIR.

01:59:31.264 --> 01:59:37.504 region:rollup2
CITIES OR REGIONS AND FOR. MANY

01:59:35.201 --> 01:59:39.272 region:rollup2
OF THEM IT WAS OF COURSE YOU

01:59:37.504 --> 01:59:41.141 region:rollup2
KNOW LIKE I MENTIONED I GLASS

01:59:39.272 --> 01:59:43.343 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES BUT THERE'S ALSO

01:59:41.141 --> 01:59:45.111 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES AND OTHERS THAT WANT

01:59:43.343 --> 01:59:46.746 region:rollup2
LIKE YOU SAY THEY'RE THERE THEY

01:59:45.111 --> 01:59:48.448 region:rollup2
JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO.

01:59:46.746 --> 01:59:49.149 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT BE CONTRIBUTE

01:59:48.448 --> 01:59:52.485 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT BE.

01:59:49.149 --> 01:59:54.454 region:rollup2
JOIN TOGETHER AND IN I THINK

01:59:52.485 --> 01:59:56.089 region:rollup2
THERE'S EXAMPLES EVERYWHERE OF

01:59:54.454 --> 01:59:58.758 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY'S ABLE TO GET.

01:59:56.089 --> 02:00:00.360 region:rollup2
PORT FOR A ONE TIME EVENT.

01:59:58.758 --> 02:00:01.161 region:rollup2
AND THEY WILL DO THAT BUT TO

02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:04.164 region:rollup2
REALLY.

02:00:01.161 --> 02:00:05.865 region:rollup2
MOVE FURTHER THAN THAT AND

02:00:04.164 --> 02:00:07.634 region:rollup2
BUILD A RELATIONSHIP AND HAS TO

02:00:05.865 --> 02:00:09.335 region:rollup2
BE KIND OF TWO FULL BECAUSE

02:00:07.634 --> 02:00:11.838 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE. IT'S LIKE CAN YOU

02:00:09.335 --> 02:00:13.673 region:rollup2
GIVE US THE US THEY DO AND THEN

02:00:11.838 --> 02:00:15.108 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOU'RE KIND OF DONE BUT

02:00:13.673 --> 02:00:17.644 region:rollup2
AS THE CHAIR OF THE JOBS

02:00:15.108 --> 02:00:19.012 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE. WE CONTINUE TO.

02:00:17.644 --> 02:00:20.547 region:rollup2
.

02:00:19.012 --> 02:00:21.781 region:rollup2
IT'S AN ODD LOOK AT YOU KNOW

02:00:20.547 --> 02:00:24.584 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE FUTURE WORKFORCE

02:00:21.781 --> 02:00:26.186 region:rollup2
GONNA LOOK LIKE. AND ARE WE

02:00:24.584 --> 02:00:26.753 region:rollup2
PREPARING OUR STUDENTS FOR THOSE

02:00:26.186 --> 02:00:30.023 region:rollup2
FUTURE JOBS WE KNOW THAT. WE

02:00:26.753 --> 02:00:31.825 region:rollup2
ARE.

02:00:30.023 --> 02:00:34.494 region:rollup2
MOVING IN ONE WAY BUT THERE'S

02:00:31.825 --> 02:00:36.463 region:rollup2
OTHER AREAS WERE NOT DOING WELL

02:00:34.494 --> 02:00:38.665 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S BEEN A BIG EMPHASIS

02:00:36.463 --> 02:00:40.400 region:rollup2
ON. KIND OF RE LOOKING BACK AT

02:00:38.665 --> 02:00:41.367 region:rollup2
CT  <u><c.green>WHICH IS A WHOLE NOTHER</c></u>

02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:42.669 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WE WON'T GET INTO

02:00:41.367 --> 02:00:44.604 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:00:42.669 --> 02:00:46.473 region:rollup2
BUT THE POINT IS NOT EVERYBODY'S

02:00:44.604 --> 02:00:47.941 region:rollup2
GOING TO GO DOWN ONE PASSED AWAY

02:00:46.473 --> 02:00:49.709 region:rollup2
AND STE TO MAKING SURE THAT

02:00:47.941 --> 02:00:51.544 region:rollup2
STUDENTS UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S

02:00:49.709 --> 02:00:53.680 region:rollup2
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES WHETHER IT'S

02:00:51.544 --> 02:00:55.415 region:rollup2
THE TWO YEAR THE FOUR YEAR OR.

02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:56.983 region:rollup2
ARE PRACTICAL.

02:00:55.415 --> 02:00:58.785 region:rollup2
WELL PAIN PROFESSIONS

02:00:56.983 --> 02:00:59.853 region:rollup2
BUT

02:00:58.785 --> 02:01:01.721 region:rollup2
THERE COULD BE A SIDE

02:00:59.853 --> 02:01:03.690 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AND ALL OF THIS IS

02:01:01.721 --> 02:01:04.924 region:rollup2
MAYBE WE REALLY DO LOOK MAYBE IT

02:01:03.690 --> 02:01:06.459 region:rollup2
ISN'T A HEALTHY START CAREER

02:01:04.924 --> 02:01:08.928 region:rollup2
COORDINATOR BUT MAYBE IT'S

02:01:06.459 --> 02:01:11.898 region:rollup2
SOMETHING. LIKE A NAVIGATOR THAT

02:01:08.928 --> 02:01:13.666 region:rollup2
COULD WORK THROUGH.

02:01:11.898 --> 02:01:15.635 region:rollup2
IN THAT CASE IT WAS OUT OF THAT

02:01:13.666 --> 02:01:17.604 region:rollup2
I THINK QUE EIGHT SCHOOLS OUT

02:01:15.635 --> 02:01:19.806 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY. MAY KNOW TEACHERS

02:01:17.604 --> 02:01:21.241 region:rollup2
WOULD APPLY BUT THEIR JOB WAS TO

02:01:19.806 --> 02:01:24.444 region:rollup2
REALLY BUILD A BUILD UP.

02:01:21.241 --> 02:01:25.945 region:rollup2
A COLLABORATIVE AND SO TWENTY

02:01:24.444 --> 02:01:27.714 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO WE STARTED THE FULLER

02:01:25.945 --> 02:01:28.481 region:rollup2
CHEN COLLABORATIVE AND THAT

02:01:27.714 --> 02:01:30.650 region:rollup2
STILL EXISTS.

02:01:28.481 --> 02:01:32.085 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S BEEN EVERYTHING FROM

02:01:30.650 --> 02:01:33.920 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MAJOR GARDENING

02:01:32.085 --> 02:01:35.655 region:rollup2
PROJECTS TO LIKE I SAID UP

02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:38.458 region:rollup2
MEDICAL CLINIC BUT ALL TYPES OF

02:01:35.655 --> 02:01:40.160 region:rollup2
THINGS. BUT IT ISN'T JUST KINDA

02:01:38.458 --> 02:01:41.828 region:rollup2
NONPROFITS THAT HAVE AND THEN

02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:43.429 region:rollup2
BITE ITS LEADERS YOU KNOW

02:01:41.828 --> 02:01:44.564 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S THE LOCAL COUNCIL

02:01:43.429 --> 02:01:46.733 region:rollup2
SO THEY REALLY GET AND

02:01:44.564 --> 02:01:48.968 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT ARE THE

02:01:46.733 --> 02:01:51.137 region:rollup2
NEEDS WHAT CAN WE DO. BUT YOU

02:01:48.968 --> 02:01:53.173 region:rollup2
COULD FOCUS AT MORNING BUSINESS

02:01:51.137 --> 02:01:55.408 region:rollup2
TYPE OF STEM FOCUS IT DOESN'T

02:01:53.173 --> 02:01:56.709 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE. QUOTE HEALTH RELATED

02:01:55.408 --> 02:01:58.444 region:rollup2
OR HOLD PASSED IT

02:01:56.709 --> 02:02:00.547 region:rollup2
SO THAT COULD BE AN IDEA BECAUSE

02:01:58.444 --> 02:02:02.515 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

02:02:00.547 --> 02:02:04.751 region:rollup2
THAT WAS BASICALLY PAYING. UP

02:02:02.515 --> 02:02:06.119 region:rollup2
THE SALARY FOR. AND I DON'T EVEN

02:02:04.751 --> 02:02:07.654 region:rollup2
THINK IT WAS EVERY DISTRICT I

02:02:06.119 --> 02:02:10.590 region:rollup2
THINK IT WAS THE DISTRICTS THAT

02:02:07.654 --> 02:02:13.059 region:rollup2
APPLIED. NAM I'M NOT SURE WHAT

02:02:10.590 --> 02:02:14.394 region:rollup2
IT COSTS THE STATE AND WHY THEY

02:02:13.059 --> 02:02:14.928 region:rollup2
STARTED DOING IT.

02:02:14.394 --> 02:02:17.130 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:02:14.928 --> 02:02:18.865 region:rollup2
DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY HERE NOW I

02:02:17.130 --> 02:02:20.433 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THERE IS I I JUST

02:02:18.865 --> 02:02:22.235 region:rollup2
HEARD TODAY THERE'S A LETTER

02:02:20.433 --> 02:02:23.670 region:rollup2
CIRCULATING TO REQUEST A PILOT

02:02:22.235 --> 02:02:26.039 region:rollup2
TO REESTABLISH THE HEALTHY START

02:02:23.670 --> 02:02:26.539 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IT WOULD BE AT THE

02:02:26.039 --> 02:02:27.073 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF TWENTY MILLION

02:02:26.539 --> 02:02:28.107 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

02:02:27.073 --> 02:02:29.309 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THAT THE COALITION

02:02:28.107 --> 02:02:31.177 region:rollup2
THAT IS.

02:02:29.309 --> 02:02:33.179 region:rollup2
MOVING THIS FORWARD IS IS

02:02:31.177 --> 02:02:34.347 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR OUT LEGISLATORS

02:02:33.179 --> 02:02:36.049 region:rollup2
WHO'D BE WILLING TO SIGN ON TO

02:02:34.347 --> 02:02:37.383 region:rollup2
THAT LETTER AND HELP TO. TO

02:02:36.049 --> 02:02:38.718 region:rollup2
BRING THAT EFFORT IRONING

02:02:37.383 --> 02:02:40.019 region:rollup2
SOMETHING AND SO.

02:02:38.718 --> 02:02:41.888 region:rollup2
MY STAFF HASN'T EVEN HEARD

02:02:40.019 --> 02:02:43.356 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS ONE YET NOW BUT.

02:02:41.888 --> 02:02:43.923 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE COME OUT OFA

02:02:43.356 --> 02:02:45.458 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND OF WORKING WITH

02:02:43.923 --> 02:02:46.860 region:rollup2
HEALTHY START PROGRAMS THAT WE

02:02:45.458 --> 02:02:49.195 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THEY ARE EXCELLENT.

02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:50.530 region:rollup2
COMPLEMENT TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING

02:02:49.195 --> 02:02:54.400 region:rollup2
TO DO HERE AND STUFF. AND MAYBE

02:02:50.530 --> 02:02:55.435 region:rollup2
pHEALTHY START BECAUSE PEOPLE

02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:58.872 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY THINK OF.

02:02:55.435 --> 02:03:01.341 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HEALTH AS A BUT THE

02:02:58.872 --> 02:03:03.309 region:rollup2
IDEA IS HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY.

02:03:01.341 --> 02:03:05.278 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW DO YOU HAVE GOOD

02:03:03.309 --> 02:03:06.546 region:rollup2
LIBRARIES DO YOU HAVE GOOD PARK

02:03:05.278 --> 02:03:08.414 region:rollup2
SPACE AND A HAVE AND THAT'S

02:03:06.546 --> 02:03:10.483 region:rollup2
WHERE THOSE. THOSE BRIDGES ARE

02:03:08.414 --> 02:03:12.418 region:rollup2
BILL BUT I COULD SEE THAT BEING

02:03:10.483 --> 02:03:14.220 region:rollup2
VERY EFFECTIVE SO THAT YOU COULD

02:03:12.418 --> 02:03:16.022 region:rollup2
BUILD COLLABORATIVE SO THAT THE

02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:18.558 region:rollup2
MODELS YOU'RE TRYING TO SHOW OR

02:03:16.022 --> 02:03:19.492 region:rollup2
EVEN WHAT YOU'VE DONE. YOU COULD

02:03:18.558 --> 02:03:21.194 region:rollup2
COME TO TALK TO THESE

02:03:19.492 --> 02:03:23.663 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE THAT HAVE BEEN

02:03:21.194 --> 02:03:24.230 region:rollup2
BUILT BECAUSE IT IS REALLY HARD

02:03:23.663 --> 02:03:25.064 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE TO COMMUNICATE.

02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:26.766 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE

02:03:25.064 --> 02:03:28.735 region:rollup2
I MEAN AS MUCH AS YOU TRY TO DO

02:03:26.766 --> 02:03:31.537 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT BUT

02:03:28.735 --> 02:03:33.072 region:rollup2
GIVING PEOPLE. IN ESSENCE THE

02:03:31.537 --> 02:03:33.673 region:rollup2
TOOLS ARE THE BACKGROUND AND

02:03:33.072 --> 02:03:35.508 region:rollup2
THAT IT GIVE SOMEBODY A PLACE

02:03:33.673 --> 02:03:37.010 region:rollup2
TO.

02:03:35.508 --> 02:03:38.912 region:rollup2
MOVE TOWARDS.

02:03:37.010 --> 02:03:40.513 region:rollup2
I'LL JUST SAY THE LAST THING IS

02:03:38.912 --> 02:03:41.881 region:rollup2
I KNOW A LOT OF STUDENTS IN

02:03:40.513 --> 02:03:42.916 region:rollup2
HIGHER ED HAVE A REALLY

02:03:41.881 --> 02:03:44.484 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TIME GETTING THE

02:03:42.916 --> 02:03:46.819 region:rollup2
INTERNSHIPS.

02:03:44.484 --> 02:03:47.954 region:rollup2
THAT THEY NEED THERE ARE MANY

02:03:46.819 --> 02:03:49.355 region:rollup2
OF THEM ARE REQUIRED IN THEIR

02:03:47.954 --> 02:03:51.324 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL BUT

02:03:49.355 --> 02:03:53.092 region:rollup2
ALSO IN COLLEGE.

02:03:51.324 --> 02:03:55.228 region:rollup2
AND THAT EXPERIENCE IT SOUNDS

02:03:53.092 --> 02:03:56.195 region:rollup2
GRAY. EVERYBODY LOVES THE IDEA

02:03:55.228 --> 02:03:58.798 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY

02:03:56.195 --> 02:04:00.733 region:rollup2
KNOCKING ON DOORS TO TRY TO GET

02:03:58.798 --> 02:04:02.268 region:rollup2
AN INTERNSHIP A IT'S NOT ONLY

02:04:00.733 --> 02:04:05.104 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFICULT BUT THEN

02:04:02.268 --> 02:04:06.572 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES SIX BARYONS. IS YOU

02:04:05.104 --> 02:04:09.509 region:rollup2
KNOW I'M ANSWERING PHONES ARE

02:04:06.572 --> 02:04:10.109 region:rollup2
FILING PAPERS SO I THINK THERE

02:04:09.509 --> 02:04:11.077 region:rollup2
COULD BE A LOT OF WORK DONE ON

02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:12.345 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:04:11.077 --> 02:04:14.447 region:rollup2
WE'RE THAT WE'RE GONNA BRING

02:04:12.345 --> 02:04:16.249 region:rollup2
THIS TO A CLOSE I AM AND I KNOW

02:04:14.447 --> 02:04:17.517 region:rollup2
THAT STUNNED MANY ON THIS PANEL

02:04:16.249 --> 02:04:18.751 region:rollup2
ARE DOING OTHER PANELS BECAUSE

02:04:17.517 --> 02:04:19.786 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA SEE SOME OF THEM IN

02:04:18.751 --> 02:04:21.988 region:rollup2
LESS THAN A MINUTE.

02:04:19.786 --> 02:04:24.958 region:rollup2
AND SPEAK ON THOSE PANELS BUT

02:04:21.988 --> 02:04:25.525 region:rollup2
NOT THIS YEAR SOME APPRECIATION

02:04:24.958 --> 02:04:25.858 region:rollup2
FOR THIS PANEL AND THE RICH

02:04:25.525 --> 02:04:26.192 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION.

02:04:25.858 --> 02:04:28.528 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAD.

02:04:26.192 --> 02:04:29.929 region:rollup2
.

02:04:28.528 --> 02:04:31.731 region:rollup2
AS ALWAYS I'M THANKFUL TO MY

02:04:29.929 --> 02:04:33.299 region:rollup2
