THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB TWENTY ONE FIFTIES PURPOSES TO LIMÃ³N EIGHT THE AMBIGUITY AND APPREHENSION THAT HANGS OVER ALL DIGITAL LASTED BUSINESSES AND THE POTENTIAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION THEY MAY BE SUBJECT. AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY FOCUSES ON ONE ISSUE IN PARTICULAR WHEN SHOULD A DIGITAL LASTED BE CLASSIFIED AS A SECURITY. AND PROCESS FROM THE TERMINATION IS SIMPLY INADEQUATE CONSISTING PATCHWORK OF REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS COURT DECISIONS AND EXEMPTIONS MADE ON BY CASE BASIS. THE RATE IN WORK USED AS THE P. FOR THE A I NINETEEN SIX STUDENTS PROTEST KNOWN AS HOW WE TEST. WAS NOT. A GOOD LOOK AT THE. THE COMING OF THE HOW DO NOT TRANSLATE INTO. WAY TO WIDE RANGE OF DIGITAL. AND BECAUSE HOW WE HAD TO DO VISUAL TEST IT CAN ONLY BE APPLIED BY A JUDGE AFTER ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT. THIS MAKE IMPOSSIBLE FOR DIGITAL OUT BUSINESS TO ACTIVELY HAVE LEGAL CERTAINTY ABOUT THEIR REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITIES LEAVING THEM TO PROCEED AT THEIR OWN RISK OF LEGAL ACTS. THE SEC MADE STEPS TOWARD THE DRESS FUSION LAST YEAR THEY RELEASED A SET OF GUIDELINES FOR BUSINESSES SEEKING TO COMPLY WITH SECURITIES LAW THEY HAVE ALSO STATED THAT MAJOR DIGITAL ASSETS LIKE GOOD POINT OR NOT. SECURITY WOW THIS FOR BUSINESS. WITH A REFERENCE GUIDE IN CLEARLY INDICATES THAT CERTAIN DIGITAL LAST. SHOULD NOT BE TREATED LIKE SECURITIES GUIDELINES ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE LEGAL CERTAINTY AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY SIX TO CLOSE THAT GAP DRAWING ON THE CRITERIA LAID OUT IN THE WE TEST. AS A AS WELL AS A GUIDELINE TO DECISIONS TO PROVIDE A CLEAR FIVE VICTIMS VERSION OF HOW WE- USE ON EXISTING RIGHT SINCE THAT IS SUITABLE TO THE WORLD-OF DIGITAL ASSETS. CALIFORNIA HAS LONG BEEN A LEADER IN TECHNOLOGY IN A IN A REGULAR GEN. AB ANYONE THE TOPPER. TO CONTINUE. THIS HAS BEEN COOL. THAT IT IS NOT OPPOSED THE REGULATION IT SIMPLY NEEDS REGULATORY CLARITY FOR THE VARIOUS DIGITAL ASSETS THAT DO NOT FIT INTO THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK. AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY IS ABOUT GIVING BUSINESSES A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO DO BUSINESS IN OUR STATE. THIS CLEARLY IS NEEDED NOW THAN EVER WE LOOK BUILD OUR ECONOMY AND A POST PANDEMIC WORLD. NEED TO BE WHEN ALL WE CAN TO STIMULATE JOB. AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR A CONSTITUENTS WALL ENSURING ADEQUATE CONSUMER PROTECTION THERE IS NO BETTER WAY TO DO THAT THEN PROVIDE CLARITY TO AN END. RED TO ACCEPT. AND THERE IS NO BETTER PLACE TO DO SO- THEN IN CALIFORNIA THE NATION'S LEADER IN TECHNOLOGY PEOPLE ALREADY DOING THIS THE WORKING IN THIS. FIELD EVERY SINGLE DAY NOT JUST THESE BUSINESSES BUT CONSUMERS WE CHOSE THIS PATH BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING MORE. CLARITY AND-IT WAS SOMETIME REGULATION IN PLACE WHEN IT COMES TO THESE DIGITAL ASSETS. SEC HAS ALREADY MADE DETERMINATIONS BASED ON GUIDELINES ACCEPTING THINGS LIKE THAT POINT AND IF YOU'RE A YOUNG BUT THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING. PLACED IN LAW BY US PASSING THIS LAW WE RUN AFOUL OF NO BETTER LAW THERE IN BETTER. REGULAR SEASON THESE SPECIFIC ARE COMMODITIES OTHER THAN EXISTS IT'S AT WHAT IS A EXIST IN TERMS OF HOW SECURITIES ARE REGULATED BUT THESE DIGITAL ASSETS DO NOT FIT. IN THOSE CATEGORIES THE SAME WAY THAT EXISTING COMMODITIES IS A LASSEN OR OTHER ASSETS THAT ARE CONSIDERED SECURITIES DO SO THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. ONE IS GOING TO BE. WEST COAST AND- ARE GOING TO BE THE LEADER OF THE FINANCIAL. WROTE AND IF YOU WILL. WHAT'S NEXT IN TERMS OF THE WORLD OF FINANCE AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO I JUST FRAMEWORK. TO BE A LEADER. THAT CAN LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WE'RE NOT GOING BEYOND THE PALE BECAUSE PAUL.

GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS WILL HOLD UP THE I AM A SENIOR DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE I'VE BEEN A PROSECUTOR FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS AND DEDICATED MY LIFE AND CAREER TO PROTECT THE VICTIM. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS I HAVE SPECIAL PROSECUTING MAJOR FRAUD AND I WILL CRIME CASES AND HAVE BECOME AN EXPERT IN THE AREA OF CRYPTO. BLOCKCHAIN AND WEBER. TODAY I'M- IN MY- IS THE CO CHAIR OF THE HIGH TECH COMMITTEE FOR THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. ONE THOUSAND PROSECUTORS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT STRIVE TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. LET ME START BY SAYING I'M AN ADVOCATE FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY ESPECIALLY BLOCKCHAIN AND DIGITAL CURRENCY UNDERSTATEMENT SECURE REGULATION. UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL ENDANGERS THE SAFETY OF CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AND INVESTORS AND DESTROYED EXISTING SECURITIES REGULATIONS WE NEED AS PROSECUTORS TO PROTECT VICTIMS OF FRAUD IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL IS RIDDLED WITH BACON AND THE US TECHNOLOGY TERMS TO PROVIDE. CLARITY THIS BILL LESION ALLEN FRAUD INSIDE CRIME AT A TIME WHERE. NEED ESTAMOS DURING A DOWNTURN.

MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS FOR EITHER THE WITNESSES ARE THE AUTHOR PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONE. TO BE RECOGNIZED AND I SEE ASSEMBLYMEMBER BARRICADE HANNAH AND THEN. MEANT THAT IS ONLY NUMBER STONE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO I WOULD JUST LIKE THE AUTHOR TO ADDRESS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S. IF SECURITIES LAWS ARE THE PRIMARY WAY THAT THEY'RE GOING AFTER BAD ACTORS IN THIS SPACE AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE ANALYSIS. SITES THAT OVER 80% AND BE THERE FRAUDULENT I'M CONCERNED THERE ISN'T A WAY. TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. ARE THERE ALTERNATIVES. I MEAN WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT PROVIDING A BLANKET EXEMPTION FOR ALL THE TO LHASA FOR FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IN THIS BILL. BUT I AM AGAIN AND WHAT I WHAT I WOULD WHAT I WOULD CONTEND IS. IS THAT YOU KNOW. RIGHT NOW THERE IS A LACK OF CLARITY IN EXISTING LAW WHEN IT COMES TO HOW YOU PROSECUTE. OR HOW YOU GO AFTER IN AND CATEGORIZE THE SPECIFIC ISSUES AND- WITHOUT THAT CERTAINTY I THINK IT. IT I CERTAINLY FROM A DISTRICT PERSPECTIVE COULD UNDERSTAND HAVING A LACK OF CERTAINTY IN A LACK OF CLARITY BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU MORE OPTIONS TO PROSECUTE. AN INDIVIDUAL FROM ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE I WOULD SAY. THAT THERE ARE PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WHEN YOU DO GO OUT PLEASE. THERE IS SPECIFICALLY LATE AT LAW EXACTLY WHY. THE LAW STATES IN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT QUALIFIES A SECURITY WHAT I CALL. SECURITY WHEN HE TO DO LAST WE'RE NOT ANYTHING WHEN IT COMES TO CONSUMER FOR. NOT IMPACT AT ALL ALL TRYING TO DO. IS ALLOW. LAW THE OP. TO CONSIDER ATION THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY AND HOW IT APPLIES. TO PEOPLE AT WORK IN DEALING WITH EVERYTHING WITH THAT AND I. THERE'S. THERE IN EXIST LAW WHEN IT COMES TO THE DID ALLOW. WE ARE PROVIDING THAT CLEAR. WHICH I THINK IS AND- FROM A BUSINESS FOR. ALL DAY LONG WE HEAR ABOUT. UNDER YEAH. CLEARLY WE NEED TO CLARIFY ASKING FOR REGULATION WE JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT ARE WE- AND WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING. THAN WHAT THE AT THE- IS. BEEN WORKING ON. SO THEY PROVIDE GUIDE. THEY'VE EXEMPTED BIT. THEY'VE EXAM SO THEY THEY A. X. THING IF HIM THE STATE DONE A THE BETTER GOVERNMENT OF THE FED. LATER AS HE SAW HAS AND THE REASON WHY WHICH THIS. IS BECAUSE- THERE IS THE SEC IS GOING TO MAKE AN ACTUAL. THERE TO MAKE AN ACTION A DIRECT THAT WERE MAY THIS. RIGHT NOW Y. O. CALL. VERY FEW OTHER STATES THEY WERE. DONE AND I NOT AWARE OF ANY ISSUES THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THOSE STAY. THAT ALONG THE LINE THE DISTRICT IS OPERATE AGAINST. I WOULD AYE AYE AYE WITH ONE AMEND DISAGREE BUT- WE'VE TRIED TO WORK THEM FROM DAY ONE WHEN THEY HAD REYES SIMPLER. AND IF THAT'S WE WILL HAVE. TWO OF THEM AND I THINK IT ALSO. THERE'S THAT. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH DB OUR WHO IS THE STATE RAY. IN THIS. SO AND WE'RE NOT A CAR. WITH THEM YES. AND THEY DID NOT RE THE SAME OF COMES. THAT THE DA IS RAY THAT THE DAY. ATTORNEY ESOS OF RAISING. WHEN COMES TO THE AND FOR THEY'VE BEEN. TO HOW DO WE PROVIDE MORE PLAYER. SO WE KNOW AS A REGULATOR WERE WE CAN GO AND SO THAT BUSINESSES ARE. ON THEY CAN'T CAN'T DO. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW. IT'S GOING TO GET TO A PLACE WITH GOING TO BE AS FOR THIS BILL. NOT ENTERED IN MIND ABOUT A QUESTION WE HAVE SESSION IF YOU'RE ON THE PHONE MISTER GUPTA SO I GUESS MY DEAR. OKAY HI UNDER. WAS THAT. YOUR SAY THE MECCA YOU HOW FOR GOING AFTER THESE. BAD ACTORSIS SECURITIES LAW SO WE CARVE OUT. AND THESE BLOCKING TECHNOLOGIES FROM SECURITIES LAW THEN WE HAVE NO MECHANISM WITH WHICH TO GO AFTER THEM MY UNDERSTANDING RIGHT. NO THIS IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY TOOLS THAT WE HAVE AND THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK THAT IS HOW WE TEST WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE LEGAL TECHNICALITIES. THE CLARITY IS PROVIDED BY THE HOW WE TAX THAT HE HAS BEEN HELD A GOOD LAW FOR SO LONG BECAUSE IT PROVIDES THE CAT AND IT'S RIGHT THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN. BALANCING THE SAFETY CONSUMERS AND INVESTORS BUT ALSO BALANCING THE INNOVATION OF BUSINESSES TO PROMOTE NEW BUSINESS AND NEW BUSINESS IDEAS. THE MAIN REASON I HAVEN'T OUR OUT OF TOUCH THEN HELLO. IN SPACE THANK. IN ANY OTHER TYPE TECHNO. IS BECAUSE IT NOT NEED. THE FLEXIBILITY TO HOW TEST OUR IT TO A TO ANY TYPE OF BUSINESS AND I CAN TELL YOU AS THE KEY. I SPOKE THE TV WITH WELL THIS SPEAKING TO. MISTER SOL. AND THEY SPECIFICALLY HOW NOT TAKEN UP ON THIS BILL AND THEY AGREE TO ME THEY HAVE A E. EDIT OR COMMENTS TO THE OF THIS BILL AND THIS BILL IS RIDDLED WITH ON CLARITY MEANING. VERY IN THIS BILL DEATH. FULLY OPERATIONAL MORE ACTIVE BONDS OFFICE THE DEFINING THEY SAID THE WORKING ON IT I. TO DEFINE IN NO WHAT CENTRAL THIS ALL THE TECH TERMS ARE THAT RELATE TO BLOCK CHAIN THEY HAVE IT IF THEY THEY HOPE TO GET THAT. LATER THIS BILL PROVIDE NO. THIRTY FOUR ONE. THE PROSECUTION BY THE AT THE STATE AND THE REASON THIS IS BETTER LEFT AT THE KEY IS BECAUSE- THEY CAN PROVIDE NATIONAL GUIDANCE FOR EVERYONE ON THE TECHNOLOGY. FROM THE CALIFORNIA PERSPECTIVE THE HOUSE HAS SERVED US WELL FOR ALMOST A CENTURY AND IN SPEAKING TO ALL THE SECURITY EXPERTS THAT I SPOKE TO AND- JUST TO BE FAIR I SPOKE TO. CRYPTOCURRENCY BLOCKCHAIN EXPERTS AS WELL I SENT THEM THE TEXT OF THE BILL AND THEIR CONTENT THIS WAS THIS DID NOT PROVIDE THEM ANY GREATER CLARITY. SO ALL I'M SAYING TO YOU ALL HERE TODAY. LET'S TAKE ALL LET'S HAVE MORE. BUT HAVE MORE CHANCE. BE LET OFF ARE. MR CALL. ARE SORRY AS MEMBER RUNS PUT WORK VERY. AND THIS. TURNS IN DEPTH. OF THE TECHNOLOGY SO THAT THEY CAN BE VETTED BY NOT JUST THE DA'S OFFICE BUT ALSO THE PUBLIC AN EXPERT SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A GOOD BILL THAT'S RIGHT TO GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN. SECURITIES LAW. CONSUMER AND INVESTOR AND PROMOTING INNOVATION RIGHT NOW EXISTING SECURITY WHAT DOES THAT WE DON'T NEED TO SWEEPING EXEMPTION JUST FOR DIGITAL ACT THAT ARE NOT EVEN TO FIND IT DOESN'T DEFINE CLEAR WHAT DO I HAVE TO TALK THANK YOU SIR GIVE THAT YOU ANSWER A QUESTION AND I SO I WILL. THE BILL TODAY I RESPECT YOUR CONCERN ABOUT GAPS IN PROTECTING CONSUMERS ESPECIALLY GIVEN WHAT THE ANALYSIS AS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF CONSUMERS WHO ARE ITEMIZED IN THIS SPACE. SO THAT THE AUTHORS COMMITTED TO BEING TO THE HOW IT GEN AND CLARIFYING A LOT OF THE LANGUAGE. SO I WOULD URGE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR SOUNDS LIKE HE IS. OPENS FINDING HEAD. I CAN'T SEE. AND WHO. BY THE TIME IT GETS TO THE FLOOR WE CAN GO TO A PLACE WHERE IT. STRIKES ACOSTA COUNTRY TECH CONSUMERS AND- BUSINESSES THRIVE. FIGURE AT ALL I WILL SAY I WAS I WAS ON THE PHONE YESTERDAY WITH THE VIDEO. WE'RE STILL WORKING ON TERMS WERE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THIS COMMITTEE WILL CONTINUE WORK THIS BUT THIS COMMITTEE. ON ANY OTHER CLEARLY THAT NEED TO BE PROVIDED IN TERMS OF TERMS. BUT I ALSO WANT TO RAISE CAUTION. THAT PUTTING TO MENTION DEFINITIONS ON TOO MANY DIFFERENT TERMS. THAT ALSO I VIEW AS A POISON PILL BECAUSE YOU'RE SETTING YOURSELF. UP FOR FAILURE LONG TERM. BEING TOO PRESCRIPTIVE. AROUND A TECHNOLOGY THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE. TO EVOLVE AND CHANGE AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT. CUSTOMERS THAT ARE INJURED BY PRODUCTS AND OFFERINGS OF AN ASSET. BEEN A I'M CAN STILL. YOU SALEABLE LEGAL. PUTTING BETTER. RESERVE THE TRADE PRACTICES LAW. THANK YOU NICK WE HAVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE. THANK YOU THAT MAKES ACTUALLY A LITTLE MORE NERVOUS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THE PROBLEM WITH THE LACK OF CLARITY HERE. IS THAT ABSENCE APPROPRIATE DEFINITIONS FOR WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH THE DIGITAL ASSET REGULATORS ARE FALLING TO THE SECURITIES LAWS BECAUSE THAT'S KIND OF ALL THEY HAVE AND I THINK WHAT THIS SPACE IS LOOKING FOR IT IS CLEAR DEFINITION OUT WHAT IS SECURITY IS OR ISN'T AND IF WE'RE NOT. TO FRAMEWORK FOR INVESTIGATING AND PROSECUTING FRY IN THIS CATEGORY. THERE JEFF I WE'RE BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY JUST EXEMPTING THEM FROM A TOOL THAT THAT THEY ARE USING. THESE ARE MORE LIKE. OTHER CURRENCIES IN PEOPLE INVESTING CURRENCIES ALL THE TIME THEY ARE USES IT INVESTMENT PRIMARILY YES THEY USE FOR IT FOR EXCHANGE OF GOODS OR GOODS AND SERVICES BUT MOSTLY THEY'RE IN INVESTMENT AND THEIR TRADED THAT MOST PEOPLE WHO ACQUIRE THESE ARE OUR TRADING THEM FAIRLY ACTIVELY TRYING TO MAKE EVEN MORE MONEY. ON THEM AND- FOR SOMEONE WHO SOPHISTICATED OR SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE RISKS YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S REALLY NOT AN ISSUE. BUT WE DO HAVE IT THERE'S LESS OF A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE IS TRYING TO SELL WHAT WE THINK OF AS A TRADITIONAL SECURITY. BE BECAUSE THAT IS. THAT IS AN INVESTMENT IN AN ORGANIZATION THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE VERY WELL MANAGED THERE MAY NOT SURVIVE IN A COULD BE SO BE SOLD A BILL OF GOODS AND REALLY LOSE A LOT OF GROUND. SO THE CLEAR DIFFERENCE HERE BETWEEN A SECURITY AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WITH THE JULY SINCE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I'M NOT SURE. TYING THINGS TO THE HOW WE TEST BECAUSE YES IT'S BEEN LONG STANDING WITH RESPECT TO SECURITIES BUT REALLY TALKING ABOUT. A BIT OF A DIFFERENT ANIMAL. I'D BE A LOT HAPPIER IF WE WERE HANDING TVO THE AUTHORITY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT REGULATORY SCHEME WOULD BE AND- I THINK IF WE JUST FALL BACK- YOU KNOW IN ALL DUE RESPECT MISTER CALDERON BUT YOUR STATEMENT THAT IF WE OVER DEFINITE. DEFINITIONAL ICE THINGS. WE CREATE. A MASS. I'VE COMPLETELY THE OTHER WAY AROUND IT'S THOSE DEFINITIONS THAT PROVIDE THE CLARITY OF ME LIKE YOU'RE- YOU'VE THROWN. YOUR SPONSORS OF THROWN SOME SOME WORDS IN HERE THAT THEY MAY UNDERSTAND WITH LEGAL SYSTEM DOESN'T. FULLY OPERATIONAL NETWORK I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS. AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY DOES REALLY EITHER AND IT'S NOT THE FACT THAT IT'S A NETWORK YOU'D BE BETTER OFF DEFINING WHAT A DIGITAL ASSET IN THIS CASE IT. DIGITAL CURRENCY BECAUSE THAT THE NARROW. SET OF. PRODUCT REALLY THAT WE'RE- ABOUT HERE THERE ARE. OTHER DIGITAL ASSETS HERE THAT COULD GET SWEPT UP AS WE'RE TRYING TO EXEMPT THE JEWEL CURRENCIES. FROM THAT FROM BEING CATEGORIZED AS A SECURITY SO. THAT'S REALLY ONE OF MY WORRIES HERE IS THAT INSTEAD OF PROVIDING CLARITY WE'RE PROVIDING CLARITY BY JUST SAYING DON'T WORRY ABOUT THIS SET OF RULES. WELL HAT'S NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS SHOULD SOMETHING GO WRONG AND SHOULD THEY BE TALKED INTO ACQUIRING. THESE CURRENCIES AND THEN THE BOTTOM FALLS OFF THESE ARE VERY VERY VOLATILE CURRENCIES THEY GO UP AND DOWN ALL TIME YOU CAN WATCH. THE LITTLE SUB MARKETS THAT THEY HAVE THESE THINGS. THAT IN THE THEY FLUCTUATE REALLY ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT- MY FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION HE IS THOUGH AND I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD SIT IN YOUR OPENING THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT. THEATER ENTRY REBUTTABLE FOR SOME. AND THE RECORD CAN BY COMMITTEE WHICH I GREATLY OKAY. MAKE THAT STAND ACTUALLY WILL CLEAR AND SEE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE IS. WORKABLE ARE YOU TAKING THAT AS AN AMENDMENT SO YEAH SO WHAT WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE THEY PROVIDED A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE WITH- WITH A LITTLE BIT BEYOND THAT WE PRESENTED THAT TO THE TV OUT. AND SO WE'RE GONNA SUGGESTION BACK FROM THE V. L. BUT ULTIMATELY WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW WILL NOT. CHANGE WERE WAITING FOR OUR FEEDBACK BACK IN THE BE ON A SPECIFIC THESE. OKAY BECAUSE IF THIS IF THIS SEVEN ENTRY STANDARD STAYS I CAN'T SUPPORT IT WILL NOT THAT. IT IS GOING TO CHECK OKAY I'M GONNA SUPPORT IS THAT AT THIS POINT. BUT I THINK YOU'RE ON THE WRONG TRACK WITH THIS BY JUST CREATING A BROAD EXEMPTION AND ESPECIALLY WITHOUT. ACTUALLY DEFINING WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT YOUR DEFINING CONTACTED BEHAVIORS RATHER THAN. ASSET ITSELF. AND THAT'S WHY I THINK YOU SHOULD GO IF THIS IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN FOR BOTH PROTECT CONSUMERS. AND PROVIDE CLARITY FOR THE INDUSTRY THAT'S DEVELOPING AROUND DIGITAL CURRENCIES AND HOW BY I THINK THAT WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER WAY TO GO. THANK YOU MATTER THEY GET THEM YES REMEMBER WICKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON AN IBM. CHECK THE INTENT OF THIS FOR YOUR THIS IS A NEWER TECHNOLOGY AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT THAT INTERACTS WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND SO I THINK THAT'S IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I DO WANT TO EXPRESS OF THE CONCERNS THAT. BOTH MISTER BACK OF OUR HAND AND MARK STONE- EXPRESSES WELL I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY SITE WANT TO SUPPORT THE CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE ON BUT DO WANT URGED WE AT GRAMMAR AND CLARITY RUN SOME OF THE LET US AND I WAS NOT AWARE THE OPPOSITION. TODAY SO I DESK AND AS WELL. EVEN WORK WITH OFF THE- SOME OF THESE CONCERNS THE MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE LAWYERS WAY BETTER TO DO IT THAN I DO- SOME OF THOSE ISSUES SO APPRECIATED. THANK YOU THINK ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. IRATE I THINK YOU US ONLY EVER CALDERON A WE RECEIVE NOTICE OF THE OPPOSITION I YESTERDAY I WAS BRIEFED ON AT ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT AND SO UNFORTUNATELY THE ANALYSIS IS NOT ABLE TO THAT- THE ANY KIND OF. PROVIDE A DISCUSSION ABOUT OPPOSITION- I DO THINK THAT MISTER GUPTA HAS RAISED SOME IMPORTANT ELEMENTS THAT NEED O BE CONSIDERED- IN THE BILL AND I TRUST THAT THE AUTHOR IS GOING TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING IN ENGAGED WITH. LEE WITH DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION OF OUR STATE- I HAD A PROTECT CONSUMERS AND ALSO TRY TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE'RE SUPPORTING- YOU KNOW YOU'RE INTO TO FAIL. SO WITH THAT I DO HAVE A AND I RECOMMENDATION- AND AGAIN I REALLY REALLY ENCOURAGE JUST CONVERSATION- WITH THE OPPOSITION WHO I THINK HAS. MADE SOME- IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS ABOUT WHERE THIS COULD LEAD IF IT'S NOT DONE IN IN SUCH A WAY THAT- CONSIDERS THEIR EXPERIENCE AND BACKGROUND WITH PROCESS SOME OF THESE CASES. SO WITH NO FURTHER QUESTIONS THAT I'D LIKE TAXES ONLY NUMBER CALDERON IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. THIRTY MEMBERS APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK. WITH THE D. B. L. AND THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE THIS IS MOST LIKELY GOING TO LOOK DIFFERENT TO PROVIDE A LOT MORE CLARITY. AND ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT HERE TODAY TO THANK YOU TIMES LIKE. AND I BOTH.

THANK YOU HI THIS IS SIMPLY AN EXTENSION I FIRST WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMUNITY DO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TO MAKE THIS AB- FIVE YEAR SUNSET AND IT IS SIMPLY AN EXTENSION OF A PILOT PROGRAM THAT SERVES TO PROVIDE RESPONSIBLE LENDING FOR NUMBER BUSINESSES AND SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES LAST NIGHT WHAT THANK YOU. THAT WAS LIKE TO THE POINT- SAID NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE MODERATOR DO WE HAVE A I WANT TO REMIND THE WITNESSES THAT YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH FIRST WITNESS IN SUPPORT WILL BE TESTIFYING OVER THE PHONE MODERATE CONNECT. NICK BURKE LINE IS OPEN YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS NICK PORK AND I'M THE LEADER OF THE CONSUMER FINANCE PROGRAM AT THE PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WE HAVE RESEARCHED ACADIAN SMALL DOLLAR LOAN MARKET INCLUDING SURVEYS NUMEROUS FOCUS GROUPS AND EXTENSIVE REVIEW OF ACADEMIC AND REGULATORY DATA. OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT CRITERIA FOR CONSUMER SUCCESS WITH SMALL LOANS ARE THESE. HAVING ENOUGH TIME TO REPAIR. TO SMALLEST PAYMENTS. THREE AMORTIZATION THAT IS EACH PAYMENT REDUCES THE PRINCIPAL AND FOR FAIR PRICES. WHICH MEANS IN THIS CONTEXT ACOSTA THAT IS A MERE FRACTION OF WHAT PAID A ANOTHER SUBPRIME LENDERS CHARGE SIMILAR CUSTOMERS. THE PILOT PROGRAM IN QUESTION MEETS THESE CRITERIA THEREFORE BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS PIECE SUPPORT MAKING THE PILOT PROGRAM. PERMANENT SADLY CALIFORNIA'S FLOODED WITH DANGEROUS WAYS TO BORROW MONEY INCLUDING FEE BASED OVERDRAFT UPON AND RENT TO OWN. AND OF COURSE PAYDAY LOANS IN CALIFORNIA THE TYPICAL CUSTOMER WHO BORROWS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS RETAIL IS SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLARS TO THE LENDER BY THE TIME THEY FIND THEIR WAY OUT OF THAT DEBT SIX MONTHS LATER. THAT'S FOUR THIRTY FORTY THOUSAND FINANCE CHARGES. BUT UNDER THE PILOT PROGRAM THE SAMEPERSON COULD BORROW DOUBLE THE AMOUNT AND PAY ONLY ABOUT NINE DOLLARS IN CHARGES THAT SIX TIMES LAST. AND THE BENEFIT OF CLEARLY DISCLOSED PROPERLY AMORTIZING INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS. WHILE MOST PAYDAY LOAN. AS OF 310024100% MOST PILOT LOANS HAVE A P. R.'S FIT. DB OVER SHOW THAT THE- EVERY MAN LOW AND MOST PILOTS. WERE INCREASING THEIR CREDIT SCORES. THE PROGRAM IS NOT PERFECT AND IT DOES NOT NEED ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS THE PEW HAS PUBLISHED BUT THE PROGRAM IS SOUND. IRONICALLY ONE OF THE GREATEST WEAKNESSES MAYBE IT'S FIXED INTEREST RATE STRUCTURE WHICH MAY THREATEN ITS LIABILITY OVER TIME ONE POSSIBLE MEASURE TO BOOST THE PILOTS. AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE CREDIT WOULD BE TO KEEP THE CURRENT FEE STRUCTURE IN THE PROGRAM BUT CHANGE THE INTEREST RATE STRUCTURE TO MATCH AB FIVE THIRTY NINE SET FOR CONSUMER FINANCE LOANS LAST YEAR. THAT NEARLY ENOUGH TO LAW WHICH OF COURSE CHAIRWOMAN LIMÃ³N SPONSORED CAPPED CONSUMER FINANCE INTEREST RATES AT THE SIX TEN PLUS THE- FUNDS RATE. IN EITHER ON SECURED LOAN MADE TO PEOPLE OR NO CREDIT SCORES. WE FIND THE DELINQUENCY RATES A MODEST CREDIT SCORES INCREASED- LOCAL ACROSS THE BOARD WERE WIDELY. AND LOAN COSTS ARE LOW COMPARED TO THE OTHER OPTIONS ON THE MARKET. BASED ON THIS ANALYSIS AND ON YEARS OF RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD Q. SUPPORT MAKING THE PILOT PROGRAM PERMANENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU OUR SECOND WITNESS IN SUPPORT IS VAN COLLUDED SKI WHO WILL BE ALSO BE ABLE TO TESTIFY OVER THE PHONE AB MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE CONTACT US WITH VAN PALLADIAN SKI AND I'M SO SORRY FOR MY MISPRONOUNCING OF THE LAST NAME.

A BAR HAVE AN AVERAGE INCOME OF THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR 40% OF OUR APPLICANTS HAVE NO CRITICAL HI YEAH MICHAEL SCORE THOSE ARE AND THEY DO. NOT HAVE A PRIVATE SCHOOL. EVERY IS LESS THAN FIVE EIGHT FIVE HUNDRED EACH. ARMY IS NEVER BEEN MORE THAN DOING THE NINETEEN FIRST THE PILOT PROGRAM IS THAT SHE CAN PRESS ABOUT COME.

THANK YOU FOR THE TV THERE'D BEEN A TOTAL OF ONLY EIGHT CONSUMER COMPLAINTS FILED OUT OF TOWN AND. THIRTY ONE THOUSAND NINE ONE. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND THOUSAND. SEPARATE ONE TWO NINE. ALL ALTHOUGH TO COMPLAIN TO A DIFFERENT. LIKE A LOW LEVEL OF COME OVER ANYTHING BUT LACKS NOW LAST YEAR WE GO AGAIN SIXTEEN ABOUT FINER PARTNERS IN THE DITCH THAT MADE UP A STORM OF PEACH. UNLIKE FINALS ARE NOT A LOT RIGHT LONG CALCULATE NEGOTIATE WON'T TURN AND IT FEELS LIKE AND SHE GOT CAPS NEVER PASSED ON TO THE BAR AND NOT TIED TO ANYONE ABOUT. BY DESIGN THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE MUCH STRICTER THAN DOUBLE. CLICK WITH. ONE THERE IS A PILOT PROGRAM DRAMATIC IMPROVED ACCESS MORE FOR. TURN TO A LONG. WHY DO YOU DEFINE IS THE RATIO PAID A LONG STORY. TO STORES OFFERING I DID PROGRAM LONG NOW TWO POINT FOUR TO ONE. WITHOUT TWENTY YEARS DURATION EIGHT.

LANGUAGE AS AUTHOR INDICATED- THE BILL LANGUAGE DOES NOT SPECIFY THAT THE OUTSTANDING JOB IT MUST BE A FINAL JUDGMENT WHERE THERE'S NO APPEAL PENDING AND THE TIME TO APPEAL HAS LAPSED. WHERE THE CONCEPT IS USED IN THE LABOR. MUCH TIME LANGUAGE USED IN SURE THIS IS A FINAL. AND ARE OFF. LET CITES THE FIVE.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND YOU ADDRESS THIS IN YOUR PRESENTATION OPPOSITION ALSO CALLED OUT. BUT I'M JUST PULLING UP TO THE ACTUAL PHRASE ITSELF JUST FOR CLARITY AND EMPHASIS. WHERE IT SAYS THAT AT LEAST THE STRINGENT AS STATE LAW AND I THINK THE CONCERN IS. THE PROVISION FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO- IN ACT THE AUTHORITY OF LOCAL LAWS A CONSISTENT WITH STATE LAWS. AND I BELIEVE YOU'VE ALREADY STATED THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK ON THAT AND- AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. YES IN AN IMPACT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CREATE. A NEW PROVISION IF YOU WELL WE JUST WANT TO STREAMLINE THE ABILITY OF THE WORKER WHO FILES- A CLAIM UNDER A LOCAL JURISDICTION TO NOT HAVE TO FILE THE SAME CLAIM UNDER THE STATE. BANKING. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTION MEMBERS. SEE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AS A MEMBER GONZALEZ WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES AS- IN WHICH THAT IS ALWAYS A PROBLEM AND WE CAN PULL OUT A HUNDRED EXAMPLES OF TIMES WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS HAPPENED AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE IT OFTEN HAPPENS IN A IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. LIKE MINE. BUT IN PARTICULAR WE KNOW AS BUSINESSES WERE FACING TOUGH TIMES AND SHUT DOWN THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW A WHOLE HOST OF WHICH THAT CLAIMS. I'M SOME FILED FOR FEDERAL AT HELP. CLAIMING THAT THEY WERE PAYING PAYROLL WHEN THEY WEREN'T US SOME JUST NEVER ISSUE THAT LAST CHECK IN THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ONGOING ISSUE AS PEOPLE TRY TO START UP AS NEW COMPANIES NOW IS THE TIME.

MANAGER AT YOUR PLEASURE THANK YOU VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY BRING BEFORE YOU AB TWENTY FIVE A ONE TO ADDRESS THE VERY DIFFICULT FINANCIAL SITUATIONS THAT MANY CALIFORNIA FAMILIES ARE EXPERIENCING TODAY DUE TO NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THE CORONA VIRUS CAUGHT UNPREPARED NOT ONLY FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO FROM A CONSUMER FINANCIAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVE SINCE THE LAST RECESSION LIVING EXPENSES HAVE INCREASE MUCH FASTER THAN WAGES AND CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLD ENTERED IN THIS PANDEMIC WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF DEBT. THAN WE HAVE EVER SEEN. THE RAPID DETERIORATION OUR ECONOMY AND LABOR MARKET ARE HAVING A DEVASTATING FINANCIAL EFFECT ON THE FAMILIES. WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROJECTING A TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION DECREASE IN PERSONAL INCOME STATEWIDE THIS YEAR. FOR FAMILIES WERE BARELY GETTING BY THE FOR THIS CRISIS HOW ARE THEY GOING TO COPE WITH THIS TEMPORARY REALITY UNTIL WE CONTAIN THE VIRUS AND CAN SAFELY RETURN TO NORMAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. AB TWENTY FIVE A ONE SIX TO PROVIDE THESE FAMILIES WITH TIME TO WEATHER THE STORM. THE BILL DOES NOT FORGIVE OR CANCEL ANY DEBT. INSTEAD IT REQUIRES LENDERS TO OFFER FORBEARANCE OR A TEMPORARY DELAY IN MAKING PAYMENT ON MORTGAGES CAR LOANS PACE ASSESSMENT CONTRACTS AND PAYDAY LOANS. AS THE EMERGENCY SUBSIDES AND PEOPLE CAN RETURN TO WORK THE BILL PROVIDES THE PATHWAY BACK FOR CONSUMERS TO RESUME AND MAKING THEIR LOAN PAYMENTS. I DID NOT INTRODUCE AB TWENTY FIVE OH ONE BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IS THE PROBLEM. I INTRODUCED AB TWENTY FIVE FORWARD BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PART OF THE SOLUTION. UNLIKE HOUSEHOLD. OUR BANKING SYSTEM ENTER THE PANDEMIC WITH STRONG CAPITALIZATION LEVELS PARTIALLY DUE TO THE REFORMS THAT NGUYEN IN PLACE AFTER THE LAST CRISIS. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO MANY LOW COST SPENDING OPTIONS THAT PROVIDE LIQUIDITY IN THE SYSTEM. BY PROVIDING FORBEARANCE AND FLEXIBILITY TO HOUSEHOLDS THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM CAN HELP FAMILIES WHOSE FINANCIAL LIVES HAVE BEEN DISRUPTED BY THIS EMERGENCY. USING FINANCIAL TOOLS LIKE FORBEARANCE WE CAN AVOID UNNECESSARY FOR CLOSURES EVICTIONS DISPLACEMENT AND REPOSSESSION THAT WILL HARM OUR PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS AND SLOW OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY EFFORTS TOMORROW. TODAY YOU WILL HEAR VARIETY OF CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THIS BILL. AND LET ME BE CLEAR THIS BILL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND I APPRECIATE THE VERY CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE HAD WITH MANY OF THE OPPONENTS THUS FAR. I CAN MEET TO YOU THAT I WILL WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO REFINE THIS BILL IN A MANNER TO MITIGATE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND TO PROTECT AGAINST MORAL HAZARD WHEN BARS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FOR BEARING. EVEN IF YOU DO NOT NEED IT. BUT LET ME ALSO BE CLEAR THAT THIS IS THAT IF WE DO NOT TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO ADDRESS THE ONGOING FINANCIAL CRISIS BEING EXPERIENCE IN MILLIONS OF HOUSEHOLDS IN THIS STATE. IF OF CAL. ECONOMY BEING OF A RED. IS AT STAKE. IF WE DO NOTHING. WE RISK ALLOWING A WAVE OF FORECLOSURES REPOSSESSIONS AND FINANCIAL RUIN THAT WILL NOT ONLY HARM CONSUMERS. WILL ALSO RESULT IN A PROLONGED PERIOD OF ECONOMIC DISTRESS THAT WILL PUT MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AT RISK OF FAILURE AS WELL. WE CANNOT SIT BACK AND TRUST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM ALONE. IF THIS BILL ADVANCES OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING DILIGENTLY TO FIND THE BEST POSSIBLE BALANCE OF PROTECTING CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. AND MAINTAINING THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS. OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU FOR YOUR REMARKS OF FOR SUPPORT ONCE IS LIKE TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT THE TEST WAS LIMITED TO MINUTES EACH OUR FIRST WITNESS IN SUPPORT WILL BE TESTIFYING OVER THE PHONE A MODERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE CONNECT US WITH LISA SECOND WILL TESTIFY ON ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIVE.

MODERATE OUR SECOND WITH A AND ALL IS MISTER SCOTT GOVERNOR. ALSO BE OR THE PHONE THIS IS FOR MY PLAY CONNECT US WITH MISTRESS GOVERNOR. YOUR GOVERNOR YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU KAREN MEMBERS GOVERNOR BEHALF WITH THE FINANCIAL SERVICES WITH ASSOCIATION HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. FOR YOUR INFORMATION THE IS COMPRISED PRIMARILY A SMALL CONSUMER FINANCE LENDERS LICENSED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. OF SPEAK SPECIFICALLY THE AUTO PROVISIONS IN THE BILL. WE UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE TO HELP BORROWERS ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY COVERT AND OUR MEMBERS ARE OFFERING FOR PARENTS WHERE APPROPRIATE. SEE IF THAT'S A MEMBERS ARE NOT IN THE CAR SALES BUSINESS. AND IN THEIR BEST INTEREST TO TRY AND HELP THEIR CUSTOMERS VERSUS HAVING TO RECOVER THE VEHICLE. REPRODUCTION IS ALWAYS THE LAST RESORT. AS MR GOLD MENTIONED A KEY PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL HAS TO DO WITH THE SCOPE. AB TWENTY FIVE OH ONE DOESN'T JUST PROVIDE FOR PARENTS TO PEOPLE DUE TO COPE IT. PROVIDES FOR PARENTS TO ANYONE WHO ASKS. REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE AND WITH NO VERIFICATION REQUIRED. THIS INCLUDES BORROWERS WHO WERE IN ARREARS BEFORE THE CRISIS EVEN BEGAN. FOR SMALL LENDERS LIKE MY MEMBERS A LARGE UPTICK IN FORBEARANCE IS MEANS OF BANKRUPTCY. UNLIKE BANKS MOST CFLS OR SECURITIZED TO UTILIZE CREDIT WANTS TO SO WE'LL TAKE LANDING. THEY ARE NOT CAPITAL A LOT CAPITALIZED. THERE IS NO FORBEARANCE FOR LENDERS WITH CUSTOMERS STOP PAYING FOR NINE TWELVE FIFTEEN MONTHS. IF A LENDER CAN'T PAY THEIR BILLS I CAN'T TO SOLICIT NEW LOANS WHICH DAMPENS THE CREDIT MARKET ESPECIALLY FOR THE NON PRIME BORROWERS WHO ARE GENERALLY SERVED BY THESE INSTITUTIONS. OTHER MORTGAGES AND AUTO LOT OF ONE TOGETHER HERE THE KEY DIFFERENCE IS THE CARS ARE DEPRECIATING ASSET. ALLOWING BORROWERS TO GET ADDITIONAL YEAR FREE USE WILL DRIVE DOWN THE VALUE AND GUARANTEE LICENSE FOR LENDERS. ADDITIONALLY IT'S UNCLEAR WHY ARE BORROWER WOULD RESUME MAKING PAYMENTS ON A DEPRECIATING ASSET ONCE THE FORBEARANCE IS EXPIRED. ARGUABLY THE BILL EVEN ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO WALK AWAY FROM THEIR DESKS. I ESTABLISHING A POST FORBEARANCE REVIEW PROCESS THAT WILL SURELY BE GAMED. FINALLY THERE'S THE MATTER OF A TOTAL BAN ON REPOSSESSIONS. IF FARMERS TURNED TITLE TO FOR BEAR MISTER GOLDMAN THE CONCERN WAS RISING MONNING YOUR TEN MINUTES ARE ARE CURRENTLY UP THANK YOU SO MUCH.

THANK YEARS MODERATOR A NEW MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF SO PLEASE REFER MIKE FUNDS BE RECOGNIZED. DESCRIPTION THANK YOU OF THIS DEVICE CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO THE GOOD WORK OF- MANAGERS WELL ON YOUR GOOD WORK- AS FAR AS YOUR PASSION OF FOR THE CONSUMER I DO HAVE THREE QUESTIONS AND THROUGH THE VICE CHAIR I ALSO HAVE SOME- SOME COMMENTS IF I COULD SEPARATE THOSE ASK MY QUESTIONS AND THEN I'LL STATE MY CHRISTMAS AFTER ALL THE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED. TO THE QUESTION THROUGH THE LENS OF CONSUMER PROTECTION CONSUMER OPTIONS AND TIME MEETING AND BECAUSE DANCE AROUND THE END OF THE COVERT NINETEEN EMERGENCY ORDER COMBINED WITH THE COVERAGE PERIOD THAT'S AND BILL. SURE THE CONSUMER HO ANNOT AFFORD TO MAKE THESE PAYMENTS. ARE PROTECTED AND LENDERS REMAIN IN BUSINESS TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES TO THE CONSUMERS. AYE AYE IN OTHER WORDS HOW DO- OR HOW DOES THIS BILL ENSURE SOLVENCY WHILE PROVIDING CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE THAT ARE IN DIRE NEED. SO I THINK THAT THAT'S THE BILL ITSELF RIGHT THAT'S PART OF THE CONVERSATION- I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU IS A BILL THAT. IS BIG ON CONSUMER PROTECTION AND- IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE HAD WITH OPPOSITION CERTAINLY THERE HAVE BEEN SOME VERY SPECIFIC IDEAS ABOUT HOW. THAT GOAL CAN BE ACHIEVED THERE'S FOR DIFFERENT SECTORS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL AND SO EVERY SECTOR HAS A DIFFERENT PRINTER XIN I HAVE BOTH CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED. OKAY ARE A REALLY GOOD SITE EIGHT. MY NEXT QUESTION A QUESTIONS FOR. WITH A OF COMMENTARY. I EQUALLY CONCERNED ABOUT CREDIT UNIONS. SO BASED ON MY CONVERSATIONS WITH CREDIT UNIONS IN MY DISTRICT UNDER THE PROVISIONS THIS BILL. THIS BUT MY CAN. CAN EXPECT TO SEE FROM THE CREDIT UNION AND I. THAT THE EXT OUT OF THE REACH COMPACTED WITH PROVISIONS THAT THE BILL. THEY ESTIMATE THEY WOULD ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND FOUR. IN AND IT'LL WHICH ISN'T READER OF ONE POINT 57% REDUCING CAPITAL LEVEL TO A POINT. SEVEN PER. BETTING EXTRA GREAT RISK REGULATOR. CORRECT ACTION. RED THEIR CAPITAL WAS REDUCED TO A POINT I PERCENT SO THEY WOULD SEE SO MEDIA STOPPING IN MORE A AND LINDA THEY WOULD COME FREE INCREASES TO OFFICE THE LOSS OF INTEREST EARNED ON MORTGAGE LOANS CUT OPERATING EXPENSES AND SADLY THIS WOULD MEAN ABOUT THE LOSS OF A- LOSS OF EMPLOYEES OF UP TO ABOUT 25% AN IMMEDIATE REDUCTION IN INTEREST EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE POTS NOW IMPACTING 70% OF THE MEMBERS. WHO RELY ON EARNED AND THERE TO PAY FOR SUPPLEMENT AWAY OR RETIREMENT SO HERE WE'RE DEALING WITH A FEW ISSUES CONSUMER LOSS OF ACCESS TO IT'S AN AUTO LENDING ADDITIONAL PEOPLE THAT WILL BE FILING FOR UNEMPLOYMENT COMMUNITY LENDERS WILL STOP AT OR SEVERELY REDUCE LENDING CREDIT ARE LIMITED TO HOW THEY GENERATE REVENUE WHICH COMES FROM RETAINED EARNINGS WHICH PRIMARILY FOR MAKING LOANS SO WITH THAT BEING SAID WHAT CONCERT PATIENT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE IMPACT ON CREDIT. RICH SURE NUMBER. WE'LL CALL SEVERE FIND IN SO IF CREDIT YOU CEASE TO LAY AND FOR ALL AND HOW WHERE WILL CONSTITUENTS THEN GO TO FOR FINANCIAL HELP SET THREE POINTS FIRST AND THIS IS WHAT WILL COME FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT CLEAR WE KNOW WHAT'S COMPASS FAR SO WE CAN'T SPECULATE ON THAT I THINK ALL TAKING IT WEEK BY WEEK I'M AT THE SECOND POINT IS. THE NUMBERS SPECULATE THAT YOU'VE GIVEN IS CONSIDERING THE BILL AS IS WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF WHAT IN THE ANALYSIS AND SOME AMENDMENT AREAS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON. SO I THINK THAT IT'S PRETTY UNFAIR TO ASSESS IT- KNOWING THAT THE ANALYSIS STATES THAT THERE ARE SOME AREAS OF AMENDMENTS- AND THEN I FORGOT THE THIRD POINT. SO SORRY THERE WAS. ONE LAST QUESTION IF I MAY AND ANOTHER COMMENDABLE PROVISION OF THE BILL IS THE ONE TO ENSURE SOME RENTERS RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FOR POWER OF FOR PROFIT FROM PROPERTY OWNERS WHO RECEIVED MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE HAVING WORKED ON THE ANTI RENT GOUGING AND JUST BECAUSE THE VICTIM POLICIES LAST YEAR I AM ACUTELY AWARE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF RENT AND- SHOES. SO HAVE HAS THERE BEEN CONSIDER XIN TO HOW THE RITUAL PROVISIONS WILL INTERACT WITH THE MYRIAD OF STATE AND LOCAL REGULATIONS AROUND TENANTS TENANCY INCLUDING A. EIGHT FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO THE ALICE ACT AND MULTIPLE OTHER RENT CONTROL ORDINANCES YES AND THE REASON THAT YOU DON'T SEE WHAT RICK RENTS RELIEF IS DEFINED IT BECAUSE THIS BILLS ONLY BEEN IN PRINT- YOU KNOW JUST UNDER TWO WEEKS AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS BILLION TO HEAR FROM SEVERAL BOOKS. FOR SIGNING WHAT RAP BEEF. IT WOULD AND WE- SOME OF US DO MORE WORK IN THE HOUSE SPACE AND WITH AND OF THEIR OF WHAT IT COMPLY LIKE AND THAT WILL OUT OF AN AGO SHE DEAF SO THEY THOSE CONVERSATION I DEFINITELY WILL BE HAPPENING BUT IT'S PURPOSELY NOT DEFINED TO GIVE US MORE TIME TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT THAT FINISHED LOOK LIKE WITH STAKEHOLDERS AT THE TABLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND I'LL RESERVE MY COMMENTS FOR AFTER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. ALSO IN THE DARK IN. THANK YOU HAVE A I SHARE I'M I WANT THINK THE CHAIR FOR HER WORK IN THIS SPACE I THINK ALL OF US KNOW THAT WE DON'T JUST HAVE A- HEALTH CRISIS ON OUR HANDS WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC CRISIS ON OUR HANDS AND CALIFORNIANS ARE GOING TO STRUGGLING FOR THE- FUTURE WE DON'T KNOW HOW. AND SO IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE PROVIDE PROTECTIONS TO THEM FOR THAT THEY DON'T END UP HOMELESS AND OTHERWISE AND PROTECTED. AND THAT BEING SAID I SHARE THE CONCERNS OF ASSEMBLY EMBER GRAYSON ABOUT REALLY STRIKING BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING. I'M AND PROTECTING OUR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH THE CREDIT. CALIFORNIA SHINNING AS BEAUTIFUL SAID IT THIS PANDEMIC SO THAT THE PEACE OF THE BILL I AM MOST CONCERNED ABOUT IT THE AND. FOR THE FOR. IT'S WRITTEN THAT TO CAN LEAD TO A FOR ONE THAT THE FIRE EITHER RIGHT. OR OR TELLS THE LENDER THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING HARDSHIP AND THEY PROVIDE NO ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION THE OTHER IS THAT THEY GO SIXTY DAYS WITHOUT PAYING AND THEN THEY GET FORBEARANCE. BOTH OF THOSE SEEM. NOT LIKE THE STRONGEST PROTECTION IF YOU WILL FOR THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING FOR PARENTS TO THE CALIFORNIANS THAT NEED IT WHICH I THINK IS THE BALANCE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THIS BILL IS MAKING SURE THAT THOSE THAT NEED IT. GET THE FORBEARANCE AND THOSE THEY CAN PAY CONTINUE TO PAY AND ALLOW THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO HAVE THE CASH FLOW TO SUPPORT ALL OF THEIR BORROWERS. SO I GUESS I WOULD ASK YOU TO SPEAK TO THOSE PROVISIONS AND WHAT YOU'RE THINKING IF THERE IS MOVEMENT THERE SO THAT WE HAVE A BETTER BALANCE AND WE ACTUALLY KNOW WE'RE PROTECTING THE CALIFORNIANS THEY NEED IT. THANK YOU AND SO CURRENTLY WHAT HAPPENED AND I THINK THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT AS YOU HAVE- A LOT OF DIFFERENT TO A PROCESS SEES AND PROTECTIONS IN PLACE SO SOME PEOPLE QUALIFY FOR PARENTS. I'M HERE FEDERAL BLACK OWNS. DO YOU CARES AXIM DO THE CALIFORNIA'S EXECUTIVE ORDER AND THEN. JUST DON'T AND HAVE TO JUST WILL FULLER WORK- MARK HOLDER. WHEN IT IS THAT WE CAN WE THIS. I CAME IN TATIAN. AND THAT IS REALLY HARD TO REACH. SO I'VE GIVEN THE EXAMPLE FOR EXACT. ABOUT EDT- WE AT LEAST MY DISTRICT MAYBE NOT OTHERS ARE EXPERIENCING SOME CHALLENGES WITH THE- BIG WORKLOAD OF EDT SO GETTING PROPER DOCUMENTATION FROM ET DE IS VERY DIFFICULT SO YOU PUT A CONSUMER IN A PLACE. WHERE SOME OF THIS DOCUMENTATION THAT SOME FOLKS ARE ASKING FOR THAT SOMETHING. YEAH MORTGAGE HOLDERS ARE ASKING FOR IS VERY DIFFICULT. AND SO THE REASON WE STARTED THERE IS REALLY JUST AS A STARTING POINT. I'M A FEW HOURS AGO I GOT A GREAT IDEA. I'M FROM A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION ABOUT A DIFFERENT WAY THAT IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE DONE. WHICH IS A BALANCE- BUT I THINK AGAIN IT'S A ONE OF WITH MULTIPLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WHEN WE THINK OF MORTGAGE HOLDERS. IT'S NOT JUST. YOU HAVE. GOOD HOLDERS. I THINK IT. THIS IS THE STARTING POINT OF THE CONVERSATION. AND WHAT I WANT TO ENSURE. IS THERE IS SOME STANDARDIZATION FOR CALIFORNIANS. RIGHT NOW. BY LUCK IF YOU GET THE RIGHT PERSON. AND YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE ABLE TO. USE THE PROTECTIONS OR- CAN YOU NEED TO GET. WE HAVE WORKED WITH. IN THE STATE IN THE LAST EIGHT WEEKS WE HAVE EITHER GONE THREE D. O. COME TO. THEY PAY TO OTHER MEMBERS AND YOU KNOW MEMBERS OF OUR HOUSE HAVE SENT THEM OVER TO BANKING. WHO SAID WAIT I SHOULD QUALIFY BUT SOME OF THIS THAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR. IS NOT DOABLE SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT LUCKILY YOU KNOW IN THE BANKING AND FINANCE. ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE WERE ABLE TO MAKE A CALL I KNOW WHO THE PLAYERS ARE BUT WE- DO IT FOR EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S THE GOAL OF THIS BILL TO STANDARDIZE IT SO CERTAINLY NO DOCUMENTATION- AND THE SIX MONTH NON PAYMENT IS READY FLOATING OUT THERE IT'S NOT STUFF THAT WE TOOK FROM NOW WHERE IT'S FLOATING. THERE AND IT'S PART OF THE INCONSISTENT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. DO IT BETTER ANY INTEREST IF YOU ARE. AGO I HEARD A GREAT FROM ONE OF MULTIPLE. AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ABOUT A WAY THAT COULD COVER BOTH- SOMETHING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF IT LOOKED LIKE AN AFFIDAVIT. RIGHT AND WITH THAT MEET THE FEDERAL YOU KNOW OBLIGATE TORY. PROOF BUT ALSO WITH THAT THEN YOU KNOW SOMEONE SIGNED THE AFFIDAVIT YOU TO SAY. YES I CERTIFY AND I AGREE THAT I LEGITIMATELY HAVE. A CODE NAME TO RESPONSE OKAY. IT'S ALL PART OF NEGOTIATION. AND THIS BILL WAS INTENTIONAL AND STARTING WITH SOME OF STRONGEST TUMOR PROTECTIONS. AND NOT PUTTING THE PROOF OF BURDEN ON THE CONSUMER- I AM CONFIDENT THAT AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. SOME OF IT WILL CHANGE. IT WILL BE WHERE DOES INSTEAD. AND THE- HOLDERS THAT CHOOSE TO BE AT THE TABLE TO. TWO OF. WORKING I THINK. I'M JUST EVEN IN SOME OF THE OP. THERE'S SOME FOLKS WHO HAVE LESS INTEREST- IN YOU KNOW TRYING TO WORK IT OUT THEY FEEL THE WHOLE BILL AS A WHOLE NEEDS TO DIE. AND BUT THEN THERE'S OTHERS WERE REALLY LOOKING AT SPACES THAT CAN. BE WORKED ON AND SO WE ARE AT HAVING THOSE CONVERSATION AND IF THIS BILL MOVES FOR TODAY- EIGHT DEFINITELY AMONG THINGS WE ARE CONSIDERING. THANK YOU I MEAN. I SHARE SOME IMMIGRANTS. OTHER CONCERN ALSO ABOUT OUR LOCAL CREDIT UNIONS AND THEY'RE PROVIDING INCREDIBLE FOR PARENTS TO MANY CUSTOMERS THE NUMBERS THAT THEY CAN HEAR PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. AND EVEN WITHIN THAT THEY'VE SEEN PEOPLE WHO TAKE IT. THIS CITY. IN NEEDS THE FOUR FRIENDS BY ARE IT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN. TO THEM AND I AND I. THEIR DESIRE TO PROVIDE IT TO THOSE WHO NEED IT AND NOT TO THOSE WHO DON'T I THINK WE NEED TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE TODAY. I WE- ARE PLACED. SPECIAL AND THIS. BECAUSE I IS CRITICAL. OUR INPUT OUR FINANCIAL INTRO BASS FISHING CASH FLOW ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT THE TO BE CLEAR THAT THE ISSUE OF IN THE TO AND OF A GOVERNMENT RESOURCE IS EXISTENCE IN EVERY THING THAT WE DO AS A GOVERNMENT AND I THINK THAT WE CAN LOOK- AT OTHER SECTORS WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS FOR TRIED PROVIDE GRANTS FRIEND RIGHT RIGHT THIS IS INSIDE REALLY DEALER SINCE AS A WHOLE. RAFFLES WITH REALLY A SMALL FEW AND YOU KNOW INDIVIDUALS WHO TAKE ADVANTAGE- I THINK THE TRUTH IS THAT OUR NUMBERS IN CALIFORNIA WITH FOUR POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE EILING FOR UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE STATE- WOULD BEG TO SAY THAT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ASKING FOR HELP. VETERAN CHAIR- DOCTOR REPORTER. OKAY THANK YOU I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS I KNOW THIS IS- TRYING TO PROTECT OF CONSUMERS SO HOMEOWNERS AND TENANTS AND OPEN SOME RELIEF- BY ASKING IS SIX MONTHS OF ALL FOUR BEARERS AND ALSO ARE YOU CAN ASK FOR EXTENSION OF A AND OF THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS WHICH IS SIX MONTHS OF SUPPORT OR UP TO OR EAR. I IF FARM UNABLE TO PAY MY LOANS TODAY SIX MONTHS LATER WHAT YEAR LATER. DO YOU THINK THE I'M IN MY LOAN MY PAYMENT- HAVE BEEN NOT JUST ACCUMULATING. AND THEN SIX MONTHS LATER YOU LATER. I HAVE TO PAY THE LOAN BACK THE LUMP STARTS TO DO AT THE SAME TIME ON PAID ONCE JUST ACCUMULATED A MONTEL ORDERED JUST A COMPOUND. AND THAT THAT WOULD MAKE MY FINANCIAL SITUATION A LOT WORSE. AND THAT THERE MAY BE SOME PEOPLE OR MAY HAVE ALL. BUSINESS AND RECOVER OR LAUNCH HAS SCHEDULED TO SOME SOME WAYS SO SOME PEOPLE MAY YET BENEFIT BUT THE MAJORITY TO MY ESTIMATES THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL SOLUTION FONDA AFTER SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR SO THAT'S MINE- QUESTION HOW YOU HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT. AFTER SIX MONTHS A YEAR SECOND QUESTION IS A THIS HAS ALL HOME FOR HOMEOWNERS IN ATTENDANCE. AND A NINE A- SOON THAT ARE YOU MEANT TO TENANTS A BY RESIDENTIAL TENANTS. HOWEVER MORE THOUGH WHETHER YOU AT YOUR TEN ON SO OR SO BUSINESS TOWN TO. ARE THE IN A BUSINESS TALENTS- THE RENT IF I DON'T PAY I HAVE A RIGHT TO ASK FOR NOT TO CHARGE ME AND ATTENDS STADIO FOR ALL YEAR. AND THE YOUR LATER I CAN FILE A BANKRUPTCY. AND THEN THE- PROPERTY OWNER OBVIOUSLY WE'RE SO FOR A LOT MORE AT THAT TIME RATHER THAN FACING. THE PROBLEM SO. AS WE GO BINDING ON MONTH TO MONTH IF THE STOCK. SO CAN YOU DEFINE THAT. WHAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY TEN OCT SURE SO THE TWO THE TWO PARTS I THINK YOU ASKED ABOUT THE LUMP SUMS WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD YOUR RENTS- OR YOUR MORTGAGE FOR THREE MONTHS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PAY IT BACK MONTH FOR IT ASSUMING THAT THE FORBEARANCE THE THREE MONTH AND SO THAT'S ACT ONE OF THE KERN THE CONVERSATION PERHAPS. THE REAL IMPORT POINT B. THEY'RE ALL EXISTING DISTANCE THE EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A FRIEND A FEDERALLY BACKED LOAN LIKE SALLY MAY- OR THE MAC THEY'VE ALREADY SAID THAT LUMP SUM PAYMENT WILL NOT BE. I SO YOU WON'T HAVE TO PAY THE THREE MONTHS. OF MORTGAGE YOU PAY ON THE FOUR MONTH THEY'RE GOING TO WORK OUT A PAYMENT PLAN. HOWEVER YOU HAVE OTHER AYE LENDERS WHO HAVEN'T SAID THAT YET AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG POINTS OF THIS. PARTICULAR BILL THAT IT'S GOING TO WORK IT OUT FOR CALIFORNIANS- AND YOU DO HAVE EXAMPLES AGAIN A FEDERALLY BACKED. LENDERS WHO ARE SAYING THAT THEY'RE GONNA DEAL WITH LUMPS- SLUM SOME PAYMENTS IN THE FORMS OF PAYMENT. AFTER RIGHTS A STARTING MONTH FOR INSTEAD OF PAIN LET'S JUST SAY IT WAS A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH I MEAN WE KNOW MORTGAGES IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT THAT. THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY ALL THREE THAT AND MONTH FOR YOU COULD PUT YOU IN PAYMENTS AND SO THIS IS PART OF WHAT THIS. BILL IS DOING IT'S FORCING A CONVERSATION AROUND THOSE EXACT ISSUES THAT WE ALREADY HAVE EVIDENCE ARE INCONSISTENT- HE YOU KNOW NOT JUST AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT HERE. IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL- IT'S REALLY NOW UP TO YOUR BANK HIT OR MISS ON WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO GET. THE BENEFIT AND PROTECTION OF A LUMP SUM PAYMENT. YOUR SECOND QUESTION WAS ABOUT COMMERCIAL TENANTS. AND YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE IN THIS THAT HAS QUESTIONS A COMMERCIAL TENANTS BUT THIS BILL DOES NOT COVER COMMERCIAL LOANS OR TENANT. ON AND IT DOES SO. NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S A CONVERSATION TO BE HAD THERE BUT YOU KNOW THE TRUTH IS THAT WITH FOR PROVISIONS IN IT THERE'S ALREADY. A HOT. THIS RENTS THEN CERTAINLY. TENANTS IT'S NOT AND COMMERCIAL BUT THEY'RE NOT IN THIS BILL- AND WE DID EXPLORE WHETHER OR NOT WE COULD DO THAT- BUT AGAIN WE START TO THE FOUR THINGS THAT CONSTITUENTS IN CALIFORNIA OVER EIGHT WEEKS HAVE BROUGHT TO US THE MOST AND COMMERCIAL IT IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT WORKING SPACE BUT CERTAINLY MERIT THE CONVERSATION AND I WISH I COULD DO MORE AND I COULD EXPAND ON THAT THEY'RE DIFFERENT CODES IN LOS. BUT YOUR TRANSUNION WORKS THAN A SUMMER GABRIEL YOUR PLEASURE. IT THIS IS JUST A COMMENT I WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL IT'S NOT AN EASY ONE- BUT YOU WERE NOT AN EASY TIMES RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE LOOKING AT- POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE BEING EVICTED- OF FORECLOSURE CRISIS WORSE THAN WE SAW IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. AND THERE ARE VERY FEW VEHICLES IN THE ASSEMBLY THAT I THINK ARE REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY TRYING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND ONE I KNOW IT'S COMPLICATED THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT. CONCERNS I FAITH IN YOUR ABILITY TO THINK THROUGH AND I WILL PROBABLY VOTE FOR THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. AND I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS BILL DOESN'T STOP FOR CLOSURES IT DOESN'T STOP AUTO REPOSSESSIONS IT DOESN'T STOP PERMANENT DAMAGE TO CREDIT IT IS SLOWING IT DOWN. ON WE HAVE EVIDENCE EXPERIENCE FROM OUR LAST AND RESULT IN BY TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS AND I THINK THAT THE REASON IT'S EVEN FROM HER IN IS WE HAVE SO MUCH EVIDENCE. THANK YOU FOR WHERE. BLAME AND THERE'S THAT WE MAY SEE HOMELESS. INCREASED BY 45% IN THIS STATE AND THIS IS ONE TOOL TO FORCE THE DISCUSSION HOW SLOW AT DOWN THIS BILL NO THE PEOPLE TO GET RENT DON'T WE LOVE. AND DON'T GET FOR OF. BIGGER THAN JUST THINKING HEY. YOU KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMON HAS THIS BILL IT'S LEGITIMATELY FORCING A CONVERSATION WITH OUT A VEHICLE A BILL AS A VEHICLE. WE DON'T HAVE A CONVERSATION AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT IT'S DOING AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN THE FIRST WEEK OF IT IN PRINT WE'VE HAD LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS. LOTS OF IDEAS SOME THAT ARE EASIER THAN OTHERS TO TALK ABOUT AND SOME THAT ARE YOU KNOW LESS EASY. AT TWO TO ACCEPT OR TO THINK ABOUT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY CLEAR THAT. YOU KNOW I PUT CONSUMERS FIRST- WHERE THIS LEGISLATURE WILL END UP I'M NOT SURE. RESERVE A ROOM AT THE BORDER. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR AND- THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR FOR FREE FOR THIS BILL- AND- FOR THE CONVERSATIONS THAT THE WE HAD ABOUT IT I CERTAINLY APPLAUD YOUR EFFORT TO HELP HOMEOWNERS AND- CONSUMERS AND BORROWERS AND YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT FOLKS IN THE STATE ARE STRUGGLING. MIGHTILY WERE SEAT ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS I THINK WHAT'S STRIKING TO ME IS JUST THE NUMBER FOUR COULD NEVER STRUGGLE BEFORE WHO ARE NOW STRUGGLING PEOPLE WHO'VE NEVER HAD TROUBLE MAKING A PAYMENT- WHO NEVER HAD TROUBLE PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR NOW FINDING THEMSELVES IN A VERY CHALLENGE. IN DIFFICULT WORLD- I APPRECIATE THE INTENT HERE- I ALSO APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION WE HAD ON ON SUNDAY LOOKED OUT OF MY PHONE WAS OVER AND YOU AND I WERE ON THE PHONE FOR OVER AN HOUR. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR GRACIOUSNESS AND- WALKING WALKING THROUGH WITH ME A LOT OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. I DO WANNA SO SEE MYCOMMENT WITH I GUESS MICHAEL MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE EAST BAG. MAYBE BOTH FROM THE CITY OF WALNUT CREEK OR OR YEAH BUT YOU KNOW AYE AYES I SHARE WITH YOU I HAVE REAL CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL BOTH ABOUT THE- BUT SOME OF. THE TAIL AND A THE BROADER ROAD. HELLO IS THIS SOME OF. CONSEQUENCES MIGHT BE. THE SAME PROVIDE RELIEF AND FORTY TO FOLKS WE MAY BE ON IT CONSEQUENCES THE THAT HURT OTHERS LIKE A YOU ARE CALLING FROM ON A CREEK MENTIONED YOU KNOW THAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO EMPLOYEES ARE CREDIT UNIONS WOULD BE LAID OFF IT'S A FUN HAVING SOME FOLKS TO STATE YOUR HOME TO PAY YOUR TO MOTHER TO MY COMMUNITY ARE ARE BEING LAID OFF YOU KNOW THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BALANCING CALIBRATE REALLY REALLY CAREFULLY- AND I AND I THINK THE BALANCE THIS. IS SOMETHING THAT PARDON SO I WANT TO SURE WHERE DO THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPEN THAT WE ARE ARE DOING THEM IN A WE WERE NOT ORDER THE PIC THERE'S AND OURS I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOUR BILL DOES THAT BUT I WORRY ABOUT. LOOKING AT THE BROAD SWEEP. THIS ONE. THAT WE HAVE A PATCHWORK THEIR- REALLY HELP SOME. AND NOT HELP OTHER AND- THERE MIGHT NOT BE A LOT OF CONSISTENCY BEHIND THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT THE CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS ARE. ARE VERY WARRANTED- WHEN I ALSO WORRY A LITTLE BIT YOU'RE YOU'RE FOR THEIR- OTHER POINT ABOUT. ABOUT FREEBIES THAT- SOME OF THE MESSAGING AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING THIS ABOUT YOUR BILL BUT SOME THE OTHER PROPOSALS ARE GIVING FOLKS THE WRONG APPROACH THERE IS THERE. ARE THERE ARE. AFFECTED BUT THERE'S A MAGIC WAND APPROACH OUT THERE THAT THE LEGISLATURE GOING TO WAIVE ITS MAGIC WAND AND- THEIR ECONOMIC WOES ARE GOING TO GO OUT AND- AND THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN'T DO FOR LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL REASONS AND I THINK IT'S- FAIR TO. TO FOLKS ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW TO. TO GIVE THEM THE IMPRESSION THAT THERE ARE SOME MAGIC ONE WE CAN WE- IF IT'S- MAKE. EVERY THERE SO. YOU KNOW. IF YOUR WILL. TO HAVE A- CONVERSATION. I THINK. TOM YOU KNOW. THE THINGS ARE. IMPORTANT THERE ARE WHAT. THEY NEED. YES LEAVE US TO BE TARGETED TO THE ARE AND HOW NO ONE IN ROOM MEMBERS OF CONTINUED FOR THEIR CELL WE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE GET REALLY WE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE GET RELIEF THE BURDEN SHOULD BE ON CONSUMERS TO GO TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY HAVE SUFFERED FINANCIAL HARDSHIP IF WE'RE GOING TO THEN PLACE A HARDSHIP ON OUR CREDIT UNIONS ARE ON OTHER LENDERS AND SO I THINK WE HAVE TO BE TO TARGETED- AND TOP RATED AND NOT APPROACH IN MY I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW FAILURE DO THAT WE JUST END UP DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD. I'M AND WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF KIND OF CONSEQUENCES FROM THE SALT AND SAID I'M YOU KNOW I THIS IS AS YOU SAID A REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION THAT'S WHAT I KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS IS PERFECT PASSED FORWARD. YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST. THE BEGINNING I THINK YOU SEE. WHEN YOU DISSIPATE CAN'T ROOM REVISIONS THIS THE TO OPEN TO CAN THE PER. THAT ARE INDUSTRIES AND FOLKS ARE BROUGHT TO THE TABLE THAT NOT ALL ASSET CLASSES ARE THE SAME THAT ON ALL LOANS WITH THE SAME THAT NOT ALL CONSUMERS ARE EQUALLY SITUATED AND SO. YOU KNOW BEING BE BE COMING UP WITH A MORE- YOU KNOW THOUGHTFUL APPROACH- I THINK IS ONE AND I WOULD SAY A LOT OF THIS IS I ADMIRE YOU AS A VERY SMART AND FULL POLICYMAKERS THINK THE FOLKS IN VENTURA COUNTY AND MARK COUNTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LOOK AT HOW DO PUBLIC SERVICE. AND ANY NUMBER EARLY NIGHT FOUR IN THE SPACE BE A VERY FAST POLICY MAKER AND BRING PEOPLE TO THE TABLE AND FIND WAYS TO. USE AND REACH COMPROMISE HOPEFUL YOUR TO THIS CALL PRINCE. HI I KNOW THAT HAVE THEM IN GOOD FAITH. THAT FOLKS WHO. THIS BILL WILL HAVE THE YOUR FAITH. I REALLY HOPE WE GET TO A- WHERE THEY THIS BILL BE. CUT RATED I CAN ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTED SO. I'M GONNA. TODAY BECAUSE THIS CALM. HAS TO CONTINUE YOU DESERVE. YOU TO CAN THIS CALL. IN LEAVE THE CONVERSATION. AND HOPING WE'RE GONNA GET TO A SPOT WHERE THIS IS WHERE THIS IS A BILL THAT THAT EVERYBODY CAN GET BEHIND IT'S A THIS IS GONNA BE A GOOD THING. PEOPLE INDUSTRY ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS IN A THAT THE YOU KNOW AND JUST A- IT IS DIFFICULT. AND I FELT THAT AS MY TERROR AS- AS MY ROLE AS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE- IT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO ALSO RAISE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS THAT DIFFICULT TIMES. AND I YOU ALL PROBABLY SAW I DROPPED. EVERY OTHER BILL THAT I WAS WORKING ON. I TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. AND I DIDN'T DO IT- AND BECAUSE I HAD PLANNED ON DOING IT. COVERT HIT ALL OF US WE'VE ALL BEEN DEBT. YOU KNOW DELTA AND I. A CARD. AND THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT AND SO. I DO THINK IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS THE LEGISLATURE TO NOT HIDE. FROM DIFFICULT CONVERSE. AND THAT BUT TO HAVE. THEM AND FOR THE GOOD OF. OUR SHE WENT VERY CON. IF YOU CAN. CAN PAY. HELLO SO AS- KNOW AS MUCH AS I. SAID WE DON'T WANT TO. ADD DAMAGE YOU. KNOW FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IT WE CAN'T. TAKE A BATH. YOUR NOT REALLY FAST. AND LOSERS AND PER DAMAGE PET. THAT ALSO DOES NOT. HELP FINANCIAL IN. AND THERE IS A LOSE LOSE HERE. AND WITH THAT AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES- IS AGAIN IT EXTENDS THE PERIOD OF PAYMENT IT DOESN'T FORGIVE THEM IT EXTENDS IT- AND CERTAINLY WE ARE COMMITTED TO HAVING THE CONVERSATIONS. I THINK THIS KIND. AND THE INDUSTRY PARTNERS CAN ALSO BE AT THE TABLE I TO HAVE THESE HEALTHY CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE NEEDED IF WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING- THEY'RE GOING TO HURT. WHEN OUR CONSUMERS LOSE THEIR HOMES WHEN OUR CONSUMERS HAVE THEIR CARS REPOSSESSED WHEN OUR CONSUMERS CAN'T PAY BACK ANYTHING- THAT IS GOING TO HURT THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE SAME REFER PATIENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IN EXAMPLES HE- HAPPEN BUT JUST FOR A DIFFERENT REASON. BECAUSE WE'VE NOT PROTECTED OUR CONSUMER FOR THE COUNCIL INSTITUTION. DOCTOR WEBER OCCUR PLEASURE YES- I WANT TO THANK YOU ALSO FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK- AS POINTED OUT THERE ARE. THAT THAT EVERYONE IS AFFECTED BY WHAT IS TAKING PLACE AND SO THERE AREN'T ANY REALLY- OF PERSONS WHO ARE. OF WHO CAN X. GATE THE IMPACT OF WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN THE IN THE STATE AND IN THE NATION. SO I THANK YOU FOR THAT AND IT ALSO MEANS A LOT OF ISSUES AND CONCERNS OF MY LEASE OF ALREADY RAISE THAT I AGREE WITH IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE. THAT WE KNOW WHO THE TARGET HELPING IN WHO WE AND WE DON'T DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD. IN TERMS OF THE PROP ITSELF. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE RECOGNIZE OF THAT. THIS IS CREE BY A- AND WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS. FOR IT I MEAN WE HAD NO CHOICE IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN TERMS OF HEALTH IN THE STATE. BUT THIS WAS A DIFFERENT KIND OF ECONOMIC PROBLEM THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF CRISIS THAT WE FACED. AND IT WAS NOT BECAUSE THIS RECESSION WAS NOT BECAUSE THE MARKET FAIL IN WASN'T BECAUSE YOU KNOW INDUSTRY CHANGED AND TECHNOLOGY CAME IN AND SOMETHING DIFFERENT HAPPENED. WE BASICALLY IT WAS MAN MADE IT WAS MADE BY US TO STOP. TO STOP THE ECONOMY AND TO PUT PEOPLE OUT OF WORK AND WE'VE DONE A LOT OF THINGS TO TRY TO COMPENSATE FOR IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE PEOPLE WERE ELIGIBLE. TO GET UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE WOULD NEVER THOUGHT THEY'D EVER BE NEEDING UNEMPLOYMENT WHO HAD BUSINESSES AS BARBERS AND COSMETOLOGIST AND SO FORTH AND SO ON. FOUND THEMSELVES WITHOUT OKAY SO THIS IS A SITUATION WE CREATED AND THE SAME IS TRUE WITH THE BANKING INDUSTRY THINGS OF. THAT CREATED EVEN FOR THEM SO THEY TO CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE. TO PRESS. NOT AS IT. OUR WE AS A LET. CREATED AND TAKE RESPONSE FOR THAT BECAUSE IT WAS A HIGHER CALLING IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND THE AND THE OVERALL GOOD OF THE STATE ITSELF IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE WE WOULD DEAL WITH THE PANDEMIC AND THERE WERE NOT A LOT OF CHOICES. AND I'D LOVE TO HAVE A PERFECT. BIGGER BUT THE REALITY IS ALL THIS HAPPENED VERY FAST THESE KINDS OF DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'RE HAVING TODAY ARE THINGS THAT TAKE YEARS TO COME. ABOUT TO HOPEFULLY TO ADDRESS. A CERTAIN ISSUES. BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME BECAUSE IT IS HERE IT IS NOW WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME WE HAVE TO SHUT DOWN AND SEND PEOPLE HOME. WE DIDN'T WE HAD WE DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME WAS DECIDED KIDS CAN GO BACK TO SCHOOL. SO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE- SAYS IN SEOUL. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW AND I KNOW MY- MANY OF MY BANKING INDUSTRY'S PARTICULAR MY CREDIT UNIONS THAT I'VE WORKED WITH AND- ARE STRUGGLING WITH THIS BECAUSE OFTENTIMES ARE LUMPED IN WITH BANKS AND THEY REALLY AREN'T BANKS AND- AND THEY WANT TO BE HEARD THEY WANT TO BE SEEN BUT THEY ALSO WANT TO BE HELPFUL. AND I HOPE THAT WE WILL BE WILL CONTINUE. TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND MAINLY I'M VOTING FOR BECAUSE THE CONVERSATION HAS TO HAPPEN. WE CAN'T JUST PRETEND THAT THIS STUFF IS IN REAL. THAT IS NOT THE LIVE SOLVE ITSELF IF. NOT IT WILL MAKE THINGS WORSE FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED UNLESS THERE'S SOME. CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THESE THINGS TAKE PLACE SO- AND HOW DO WE- HELP THOSE. NEED HELP AND- WE KEEP THOSE FROM. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM WHO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM. AND THAT. ALWAYS HAPPENS IF YOU STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THOSE. WHOSE TRUE ME THE- EVEN IF. COME FALL THE TAPE. WILL SEE IT. WHAT YOU DO OKAY. ONE OF THOSE. BUT I TO THANK FOR. BRING IT FOR BECAUSE IS SOMETHING THAT I HAVE REST WITH MYSELF AS- I. TALK BACK. WE COME BACK. ALL THESE THE- DOUBLE ONE OF. OKAY YOU HAVE TO PAY THIS DON'T HAVE. THAT WHOLE. ON HOLD ON. AND WE- YOU KNOW RICH SHOULD HAVE REALIZED. WE DO. THE CLINTON. ALL OF THE- WE DID. HAVE. WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO. ON FINDING. GOOD SO. ISSUE KNOWING THAT WHATEVER WE DECIDE TO DO WHAT. BE WE HAVE TO PUT EVERY EFFORT IN MAKING IT HAPPEN AT I THANK YOU FOR. FOR DOING THAT AND I HOPE ALL OF OUR OUR- OUR INSTITUTIONS WILL WORK WITH US TO BASICALLY. GET THE BEST SOLUTION WE CAN FOR EVERYONE THAT'S INVOLVED. THANK YOU THANK YOU. SO IN THE REASON YOU VICE CHAIR FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY JUST MAKE SOME COMMENTS AND I WANTED TO STATE THAT I HAVE THE HIGHEST REGARD FOR THE GOOD WORK OF MY COLLEAGUE AND- MADAM CHAIR FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE I'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU IN THE PAST AS WELL AS MY GOOD COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE COMMITTEE. NOT SINGLE AND HAS BEEN UNTOUCHED BY THE IMPACTS OF COVERT NINETEEN YET I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED THE WORST THE THAT STEP TO CALM AND HAVING SAID THAT ON THE SURFACE LEVEL WE CAN SEE THE IT ACT HERE IN THIS BUILDING WHERE THE LEGISLATIVE SCHEDULE HAS SHIFTED AND CONDEMN WERE MANY COMMITTEES LIKE THE ONE WE'RE SITTING AND ARE ONLY GIVEN ONE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET THE IMPORTANT. AT TO MEET ALL IMPORTANT DINETTE UP AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY SO ON A DEEP LEVEL THE CROWD IS FOR STITCHES AND TRICK ACOSTA ST ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH LOST JOBS AND LAYOFFS DECREASED SALARIES AND UNEMPLOYMENT CHECKS THE DON'T COVER THE FULL LOSS OF INCOME FOR THEIR FAMILIES. SO THE INTENT OF THIS BILL FROM MENTAL AND I BELIEVE IT'S ABSOLUTE HERE AND THE AUTHOR SHOULD BE PRAISED FOR HER PASSION AND CONCERN FOR THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE FACING FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS BY THE BY COVERED EIGHTEEN HOW UBER THERE ARE SOME REAL CHALLENGE POSED BY. IN ONE CITY. FOUR I. PRODUCTS THE- ARE VERY UNIQUE APPROACHES. AND UNDID O'CLOCK. AS WAS MY BY A- OF THE POLICIES THAT WE PASS. HERE CAN UNDERMINE THE INTEGRITY OF A VERY COMPLEX ECONOMIC SYSTEM. BUILT TO SERVICE THE VERY NEEDS OF THE CONSUMER THERE WERE TRYING TO PROTECT. SO ALL OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL ARE TIED TO THE END OF THE EMERGENCY ORDER A DATE THAT IS A NOBLE. AND POTENTIALLY VERY DISTANT INTO THE FUTURE. THE CERTAINTY OF LAW OF HOW LONG THIS BILL WOULD BE IN EFFECT CREATES UNBEARABLE RISK FOR VARIOUS CREDIT SERVICES AND LENDER'S. THAT COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN THE ELIMINATION OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS THE CONSUMERS NEED ESPECIALLY IN TIMES THAT WE ARE AT THEM. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT I BELIEVE THAT IF YOUR INTENT TO ADDRESS AND THE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS OVER. THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THESE FINANCIAL PRODUCTS DISAPPEARING WOULD BE SO GREAT. THAT IT ALMOST GUARANTEES AWESOME JOBS DEEP SEVEN. RETURN AND EVEN RESTRICTIONS UPON CREDIT UNIONS AND VEHICLE CHIRLA SPACE. THIS BILL. AUDIBLE AS AT ORDER REACH AUTOMOBILES ASSET. INSTEAD OF LIABILITIES WHICH POSES A RISK FOR LENDERS AND THREATENS THE OF THE DATA. OFF PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS. WITH CONCERT LESS ABLE FINANCE CAR CAL. SALES A COP SALES WILL BOOK. TO EXPERIENCE THE ASTOUNDING DECREASES THAT WE'VE SEEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CRISIS. THE SALES DECLINE IS WOULD POTENTIALLY DE. TO THE ALL SO INTO. THIS TO PAGE FUND THE SEASON. ENDS IN CARSON TAX WILL. AB IN. AND TO THE CITY'S LIKE THE CITY MY THIS. OCCURRED THE DAY. ON ALL. BREAK TAX PROVIDE SERVICES. THREE THAT'S A GROUP OF PORTION OF THE BILL ALONE MAY ASTRUM BUT THIS IS JUST ONE CA OF MANY AS IT STANDS SEVERAL QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS REMAIN UNANSWERED AND OR UNDER DRESSED WHICH YOU HAVE COMMITTED TO HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS AND IF THIS BILL IS TO MOVE FORWARD SO I WILL BE VOTING TODAY TO ADVANCE THE BILL FOR THE CONCERNS I'VE OUTLINED ABOVE I DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CONTINUING IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CHAIR AND THE BILL'S PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS TO HOPEFULLY GET TO A PLACE WHERE I CAN SUPPORT IT- IN THE LEGISLATION. IN THE FUTURE IF IT WAS TO REACH BEFORE SO WITH THAT THANK YOU. MAKERS GRAYSON AND NOT SURE IF I MAY HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS MYSELF- MY FIRST QUESTION THAT I HAVE- DEALS WITH. THE URGENCY CLAUSE IS I UNDERSTAND RIGHT NOW THE BILL DOES NOT HAVE A SEE CLIENTS. AND TERMS OF TIMING. IT'S NOT GOING TO IMPACT OUR CURRENT COVE IN NINETEEN. VICTIMS SO IT'S GOING ALL WAIT WE TO NEXT YEAR SO- IF YOU COULD RUN THROUGH THE RATIONALE BEHIND THAT SO RIGHT SO THAT'S ACTUALLY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CONSUMERS HAVE BROUGHT FORWARD IN TIME AND USE YOU THINK THERE'S A- WRONG LET. THE I FOR PAUSE AND I WOULD CAUTION TO SAY THAT IT'S GONNA CLOTHING. FOR RIGHT NOW THAT ARE DEALING WITH SOME KIND OF IMPACT ON WHETHER THIS IS PASSED WITH THE URGENCY OR WHETHER THIS APPLIES- ON THE FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THERE IS STILL VALUE AND THERE ARE STILL CONSUMERS THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM IT. ON MY NEXT QUESTION DEALS WITH THE PEACE PROGRAM SO PACE PROGRAM I CURRENTLY IN YOUR BILL AS I UNDERSTAND IT RIGHT NOW THEY ARE RECEIVING RELEASE- FROM THEIR PROPERTY TAXES. SO WHY WOULD YOU INCLUDE- THE PEACE PROGRAM ALSO IN THIS BILL SO AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THERE SOME COUNTIES IN OUR STATE I THAT HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF THAT CITY AND CITY. CHALLENGES WITH PROGRAM AM I EVEN EIGHTY THAT WE SHOULD PROVIDE HELP I PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH FIFTY. MODERNIZE IN A GREEN WAY- YOU KNOW IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WAY HOWEVER- IF SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS THAT HAVE COME FORWARD AT THAT ARE. PART OF THE REASON THAT. PACE IS INCLUDED- YOU HAVE COUNTIES THAT WILL ALLOW IT ALL TOGETHER JUST BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN DISCREPANCIES- WITH. THE WAY THAT IT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND THERE'S BEEN CHALLENGES DIRECTLY TO THE CONSUMER- AND SO CERTAINLY THAT IS WHY- WE ALSO FELT THEY NEEDED TO BE INCLUDED I BELIEVE AND WHERE THE PACE PROGRAM I IS TRYING TO GET. A CONSUMERS AND HOMEOWNERS IN CALIFORNIA THE IDEA OF RENOVATING I IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WAY SOMETHING THAT TO IS IMPORTANT TO ME I BUT I NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT EVEN THOUGH I LIKE A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION EVEN THOUGH I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THE MISSION- THE EVIDENCE. IS CONSISTENT IS THERE A NOR THAT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. LU ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS I WAS QUESTIONS ACTUALLY FOR THE KIND A CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS INDUSTRY. MR MODERATE IF YOU COULD- HELP ME FIND A MISTER DANGLED LEE WHO IS I BELIEVE ON THE LINE HE TESTIFIED. EARLIER ON. MS WILL MILLION ONE FORTY BUT. VISIBLE ONLY CAN YOU HEAR ME. IS MR DANGLED ME ONLINE. DO NOT SHOW HIM ONLINE OKAY- NO WORRIES AND I WILL- TALK TO A ANOTHER NUMBER THE FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS MIGHT MY QUESTION- IS. NO CURRENTLY WE'RE LIVING IN A PRESIDENT TIMES- FOUR POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS- ON UNEMPLOYMENT- MILLION PEOPLE ON THE FRINGES AND A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET DEFICIT. AND I WANT TO KNOW OF FROM- THE FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS AND EVERY MISTER GOVERNOR OR OR OR KEVIN GOLD HOW WILL- THE IMPACT- OF THE BILL- IMPACT NON PRIME CONSUMERS AND IF YOU COULD SPEAK A MORE ARMY HOW THIS IMPACT. OF THE BILL WILL BE IMPACT THEIR INDUSTRY. IS THERE SOMEONE ONLINE- MR GOVERNOR MR GOLD YEAH. BUT IN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS IS SCOTT. CERTAINLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS IS SCOTT GOVERNOR- THE MAJORITY OF NON PRIME BORROWERS AGAIN I'M SPEAKING THE AUTO SPACE. ARE NOT SERVED BY TRADITIONAL BANKS THEIR SERVE BY GENERALLY CFLS- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE'RE SECURITIZED WE RELY UPON LINES OF CREDIT. WE DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF EXTENDING OUT. WHAT FORBEARANCE FOR TWELVE FIFTEEN EIGHTEEN MONTHS WHO KNOWS HOW LONG- BECAUSE WE HAVE TO CONTINUE PAYING OUR INVESTORS DURING THE SITUATION SO TO THE EXTENT- WE DON'T GET PAID. A FAIR NUMBER OF MY MEMBERS WOULD DISAPPEAR AND EVEN THOSE WHO ARE ARE BROWN HAVE ALREADY SEEN AN UPTICK IN THEIR COST OF MONEY. SO IF WE GO AWAY FIRST YOU'RE GONNA HAVE LESS ACCESS FOR NON PRIME BORROWERS THE OUTER SPACE. AND SECONDARILY THE PRICES ARE GOING TO GO UP BECAUSE OUR COST OF CAPITAL IS NOT THE INVESTORS TO CALIFORNIA'S RISKY WITH A MEASURE LIKE THIS- ESPECIALLY NAKED TALKING YOU KNOW INTO TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO. IT WOULD HAVE A SEVERE IMPACT ON OUR SECTOR. MR CARE KEVIN GOLD CALIFORNIA BANKERS IF I COULD JUST ADD ON BRIEFLY- AT LEAST WITH RESPECT THE MORTGAGE PROVISIONS SERVICERS CONTINUE TO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO ADVANCE PAYMENTS TO INVESTORS. SO THAT DOES ABSOLUTELY HAVE AN ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THOSE MORTGAGE SERVICERS OTHERS PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THAT ALSO REQUIRE THE ADVANCEMENT OF PROPERTY TAXES IN HAZARD INSURANCE WHICH WILL ALSO HAVE A CONSEQUENCE. AND LONGER TERM YOU'VE BEEN ON THE DURATION YOU KNOW WHICH I THINK- SEVERAL MEMBERS OF FOCUSED IN ON- IN TERMS OF MORE WITH THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. THE LONGER YOU HAVE NON PAYMENT- THE BIGGER IMPACT IT MAY HAVE ON A BANK BALANCE SHEET WITH RESPECT TO NANAK RULES- AND THEN YOU START TO GET INTO TROUBLE DEBT RESTRUCTURE ISSUES PARTICULARLY- THAT COMES TO MIND IN A MULTI FAMILY PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. AND WITH RESPECT TO THE TROUBLED THAT RESTRUCTURES THAT STARTS TO HAVE IMPACTS ON A BANKS CAPITAL. ONE SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE VERY TECHNICAL ISSUES. AFTER HE THE QUEST BECAUSE THESE ARE THE THINGS NEED TO BE DISCUSSED- IN THE SCOPE OF BROADER- STAKEHOLDERS DISCUSSIONS. I WOULD STRONGLY URGE- THAT THE CANADIAN AND THE LEGISLATURE LOOK AT TO GET TO GET WORK THAT WAS DONE. DURING THE LAST ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THE HOMEOWNER BILL OF RIGHTS WHICH IS REFERENCED. IN PRIOR- DISCUSSIONS WELL THE SIGNIFICANT EFFORT. THAT WAS ADOPTED IN IN TWENTY TWELVE TO CREATE THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION. FOR BORROWERS IN MORTGAGE SERVICERS TO DISCUSS- FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ALTERNATIVES SO. I WOULD JUST UNDERSCORE THAT THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK THERE'S A LOT OF- FOUNDATION HERE THAT THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT IN A- AT THIS ALL. MOVED THROUGH THE- AND SPOKEN FAN ON- THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RELIEF TO PROVIDE. THANK YOU FOR ASKING THE QUESTIONS AND IF I COULD GO BACK TO THE MODERATOR THIS MY FINAL QUESTION AND- ALL WILL LEAD TO- THAT MANAGER DO ARE CLOSING- MOTOR IF YOU COULD PLEASE OPEN LINE ONE SIXTY FOR MR DAN BALMY. THIS LINE IS OPEN PLEASE PROCEED. OF MR WILL ME- CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES MR VICE CHAIR I CAN HEAR YOU THANK YOU AS WILL APPRECIATE YOUR TIME- I HAD A THE SPECIFIC QUESTION FOR YOU- I WANT TO GIVE A SCENARIO- SO MORE SPECIFICALLY. THE MAXIMUM FEE IS CHARGED CAN YOU ROUGH IT'LL TELL US HOW MUCH A COPY OF THAT FEE TO FOR THE WELL BEING. A ONE DOLLAR LOAN. SO FOR A ONE HALL A ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR LOAN THE COST TO GIVE THAT LOAN OUT RIGHT NOW OUR DATA SHOWS IT'S FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER HUNDRED TO ISSUE THAT LONG. AND IN TERMS OF YOUR INDUSTRY HOW THE IN YOUR PERSPECTIVE IT WILL IMPACT YOUR INDUSTRY AND MORE PROBABLY BASIS. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR THIS WILL IMPACT OUR INDUSTRY PRETTY SEVERELY AS WE LOOK AT THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE IN THIS BILL BOB ALL THOSE OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. BOB FORECLOSURES REPOSSESSIONS OF THAT SORT OF THING A PAYDAY LOAN IS AN UNSECURED AVERAGE LOAN SIZE OF TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR DOLLARS. THERE IS NOT ANY- COLLATERAL BEING OUT FOR THE LOAN QUITE SIMPLY IF THIS BILL- CONTINUES ON IT BECOMES LAW OUR MEMBERS WILL TO STOP OFFERING THE PRODUCT AND STORE FRONTS WILL CLOSE. THOUSANDS OF JOBS WILL BE LOST. WHERE IT'S LIKELY THAT WE'RE EVEN GONNA SEE SOME PULL BACK FROM LENDERS AT THIS BILL KEEPS GOING FORWARD BECAUSE LENDERS WILL WANT TO REDUCE THE RISK. ASSUMING THAT THIS BILL BECOMES LAW AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE DATA SHOWING CONSUMERS. ARE BEING RESPONSIBLE AND LENDERS ARE BEING RESPONSIBLE SIR WILL HAVE THEIR OWN DOES EXACTLY THE LANDING IS DOWN MR WILL UPON HIS INSURANCE. GET LAST YEAR WILL CHEN I APOLOGIZE I JUST BEEN REMINDED THE RULES- IN TERMS OF CALLING I WOULD BE ON THE WAY TO- CALLED ME TO USE. BUT APPRECIATE YOUR TEST MONEY WITH THAT I'M GOING TO- TO GIVE BACK TO THE MADAM CHAIR SEE IF SHE WANTS TO DO A CLOSING. THANK YOU AS VICE CHAIR- AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE I DO WANT TO MAKE A ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION- IN TERMS OF. THE HOMEOWNER BILL OF RIGHTS THAT WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE I WAS RIGHT IT'S IN THE RE. THAT IS DOES NOT MEET THE INTENT OF SECULAR BILLS BECAUSE FIRST AND FOREMOST THAT DID NOT MANDATE ANY FORM OF FOUR BUT ALSO OKAY. I DID NOT COVER. IT WILL COVER. KEEP I'D INTO THERE WERE NOTHING THERE FOR MULTIPLE YOU ARE FOR TEN IN AND IT ALSO APPLY THE FIRST LEAN OF MY SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE REASON WHY IF THIS IS NOT JUST AN EXTENSION OF THE HOMEOWNER BILL OF RIGHTS I FROM TWENTY TWELVE AT SO IN CERTAINLY THAT WAS MONUMENTAL LANDMARK LEGISLATION- AND THAT CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTANT FOR CONSUMERS- BUT WE- IN A DIFFERENT PLACE NOW. SO WITH. MEMBER I ASK YOU TO FAST FORWARD TO ONE YEAR. OUR ECONOMY CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE BECAUSE EVERY TIME THE DISEASE FLARES UP WE ARE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STRONG PHYSICAL DISTANCING ORDERS. UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINS STUBBORNLY HIGH. FAR HIGHER THAN THE GREAT RECESSION. DOZENS AND DOZENS OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARE CALLING TO TELL YOU THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED A NOTICE OF DEFAULT AND THAT THEIR SERVICE PLANS TO FOR CLUES. THE END OF THAT THEIR SERVICE OUR PLANS TO FOR CLOSE THEIR HOME. THEY TELL YOU THAT THEIR CAR HAS BEEN REPRESENTS THEY TELL YOU THAT THEY HAVE FALLEN BEHIND ON OTHER DEBT. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY TO THEM. WILL YOU BE WILLING TO ADMIT THAT YOU PUT YOUR FAITH IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND LOAN AND THE GENEROSITYOR LACK OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROTECT THEM. WHAT PROPOSALS DID YOU ALL BRING TO THE TABLE. TO HELP FAMILIES STAY IN THEIR HOMES AND STABILIZE THEIR FINANCIAL SITUATION. THIS BILL ENVISIONED THE DIFFICULT TIMES THAT CALIFORNIA FAMILIES ARE FACING NOT ONLY THE CHALLENGES OF TODAY BUT ALSO LOOKING MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD IT IS MY HOPE THAT THE ECONOMY REBOUNDS IT IS MY HOPE THAT VERY FEW FAMILIES WILL FACE THE FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS THAT REQUIRE THEM TO LIE ON THE PROTECTIONS PROVIDED IN THIS BILL. THE FACE THE REAL POSSIBILITY THAT THE WORLD WILL NOT WORK OUT THAT WAY. THIS BILL IS NOT PERFECT AND I COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE IT BETTER BUT AS CHAIR F THIS COMMITTEE I CANNOT SIT BACK DURING THE BIGGEST ECONOMIC CRISIS IN DECADES WITHOUT OFFERING A PROPOSAL THAT SEEKS TO PRESERVE THE HEALTH AND FINANCIAL WELL BEING OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. I THINK THOS OF YOU THAT ARE PUTTING YOUR TRUST IN ME TODAY AND ALLOWING FOR CONSTITUENTS TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WILL KEEP THEM IN THEIR HOPES IN THEIR HOMES WHAT WILL ENSURE THAT THEY DON'T LOSE THEIR CARS AND WHAT WILL ENSURE. THAT THEY DON'T GO INTO FINANCIAL RUIN I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I HAVE A. DO I HAVE A MOTION SECOND. A MOTION BY SOMEONE BEFORE WICKS- SECOND BY SOME OF OUR CAYENNE- WITH THAT- WAS MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. AB TWO FIVE ZERO ONE THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS LYMPHOMA. THE LOAN I CHEN. GEN NO VALOR QUE HAN BAUER-KAHAN I BURKE. CERVANTES CERVANTES AYE CHOI. CHOI NO PHONE. PHONE NO GABRIEL GABRIEL I GRAYSON. GRAYSON NOT VOTING STONE STONE I WEBER WEBER HI WICKS WICKS I. THE BILL HAS SEVEN VOTES. THANK YOU MANAGER ARE THE BLOSSOM VOTES AND GETS OUT WITH THAT AND WE'LL GO TO NEXT FILM ON SOME NUMBER TWO WEEKS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS HERE AND I FIRST OF ALL AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF- AND THE CHAIR FOR ALL THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL IT'S- I KNOW NOT BEEN AN EASY ONE FOR SOME OF US AND I'VE TALKED TO ALL OF YOU AT LENGTH- OVER THE PAST WEEK OR SO. BUT IT IS BEEN PROJECTED THAT THE EMPLOYMENT RATE IN CALIFORNIA WE OVER 20% WHEN THE STATE'S NEW UNEMPLOYMENT REPORT. IS RELEASED. BEFORE HAS RECEIVED FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS DURING THIS COVER NINETEEN PAT. PANDEMIC THE FOUR POINT FIVE. MILLION UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS REPRESENT TWENTY THREE POINT 3% OF THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE OF NINETEEN POINT THREE MILLION. WITH A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT THAT IS COME FROM COVER NINETEEN. MORE MORE PEOPLE MANY OF WHOM HAVE NEVER BEFORE BEEN IN SUCH SEVERE THAT. WILL FACE EVEN WORSE FINANCIAL SITUATIONS. MANY OF THESE FOLKS WILL TURN TO DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES TO HELP THEM. SOME OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE TARGETED LOAD CAN CUT LOW INCOME CONSUMERS TO ROLL THEM INTO SOME OF THE CONTRACTS THAT THEY SIMPLY. CANNOT AFFORD AND THESE COMPANIES HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY REGULATED BECAUSE OF LOOPHOLES AND LICENSING LAW IN CALIFORNIA. MANY OF THESE COMPANIES ADVERTISE OUR SERVICES KAREN TING SAVINGS FOR CONSUMERS. IN ADDITION SOME DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES HAVE CHARGED OUTRAGEOUS FEES AND ARE NOT GUARANTEED SAVINGS TO CONSUMERS. THERE FOR MANY OF THESE CONSUMERS ARE IN A WORSE FINANCIAL SITUATION WITH WRECKED CREDIT LAWSUITS FROM CREDITORS AND JUDGMENTS AGAINST THEM. THE COMBINATION OF ADVERSE FINANCIAL SITUATIONS AND HAVING DAMAGE CREDIT SCORES ULTIMATELY PREVENTS MANY CONSUMERS FROM RENTING A HOUSE OWNING A HOME. GETTING A JOB AND MORE. AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FOUR OVER BY THE NEEDED REGULATIONS REPORTING MECHANISMS LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS TO ESTABLISH THIS IS A REAL. THE WILL PROTECT VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY DURING THIS CRISIS. THIS BILL AND I WANNA BE VERY CLEAR. UNLIKE IN NINE STATES pPROHIBITED THESE TYPES OF PRACTICES IS NOT A BILL TO PROHIBIT PRIVATE DEBT SETTLEMENT ACTIVITIES I WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH HIS COMPANY'S ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS CALIFORNIA. INSTEAD AB TWENTY BEFORE TENDS TO BE A TRANSPARENCY AND GUARD RAILS FOR THE DEATH SO INDUSTRY. THE CHANGES TO LAWS THAT ARE PROPOSED IN THIS BILL ARE COMPARABLE TO SEVEN OTHER STATES HAVE RECENTLY PASSED LEGISLATION TO REGULATE THAT SOME COMPANIES. AND IS TO BE NOTED THAT THE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO DO A LITTLE BUSINESS IN THE SEVEN STATES. AND WORKING ON THIS BILL THE OPPOSITION AND I HAVE DISCUSSED POTENTIAL MOMENTS. WHICH WERE DISCUSSED AS LATE AS TEN O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT. INCLUDE STRIKING A PROVISIONS REGARDING THE VOTING CONTRACTS. TO THE STRIKING OF PERCENT ON THE ABILITY TO PAY STANDARD. AND THREE STRIKING THE 5% NUMBER ON THE FEE CAP ON THE PERCENT OF SAVINGS MODEL WITH THE COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO. WORK EIGHT TO COULD THAT THE CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION TO FIND A WORKABLE NUMBER FOR BOTH SIDES. WE ARE IN AGREEMENT ON THE FIRST TWO SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AND I WILL GLADLY BE TAKING THOSE. ON THE THIRD SUGGESTED A MOMENT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE SPONSORS AND I ARE STILL OPEN TO WORKING TOGETHER ON. A WITH THE OPPOSITION TO GET TO SOLUTION THAT SATISFIES SATISFIES ALL PARTIES. THIS BILL SPONSORED BY THE HEALTHY LAWN CONSUMER COALITION AND IS SUPPORTED BY COALITION. THE VAST AND DEEP OF LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS A CONSUMER JUSTICE GROUPS AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION. THIS BILL IS ABOUT PROVIDING BASICS TO CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS INTO SURE REGULATIONS OVER BAD ACTORS IN THIS INDUSTRY. MANY OF THESE COMPANIES ARE MAKING A PROFIT OFF THAT'S A VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS AND THESE CUSTOMERS ARE SUFFERING FROM A LACK OF REGULATIONS AND PROTECTIONS. CALIFORNIA'S ALWAYS BEEN A CHAMPION CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THESE CONCERNS ARE PROTECTED ESPECIALLY NOW AS WE NAVIGATE. THE COKE TEAM RECESSION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SOMEONE OVER WITH HER TESTIMONY- NOW FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND LIKE REMIND OUR ONCE IS A TEST MORE THAN TO TWO MINUTES EACH. AND OF MISTER MODERATOR IF WE CAN GO TO OUR FIRST WITNESS IN SUPPORT. BE SHARON JAMAL YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME SHERRIN FOOTBALL AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE CONSUMER DOCTOR'S CLINIC AT THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY LAW CENTER I WANT TO REPEAT THAT THIS BILL IS NOT PUTTING THAT COMPANIES OUT OF. RATHER WE ARE ESTABLISHING GUARD RAILS TO PROTECT PEOPLE THE CLIENT YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT IN MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TO MONEY NEXT YOU ARE NOT GOOD CANDIDATES FOR DEBT SETTLEMENT. AND THEN MANY CLIENTS LIKE HER WHO SEEK HELP SHOCKED WHEN THEY'RE SERVE WITHOUT LAFAYETTE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE SPENDING LARGE MONTHLY PAYMENTS DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES. THIS BILL WILL MAKE SURE THAT LONG CONSUMERS ARE NOT INVOLVED IN A PROGRAM THAT THEY CANNOT PAY FOR AND THAT WILL ONLY MAKE THEIR FINANCIAL SITUATION WORSE. IT WILL INCREASE DISCLOSURE IT WILL MANDATE REGISTERING AND REPORTING TO THE PPO SO WE CAN SEE HOW THE INDUSTRY IS DOING AND FOR FILLING UP PROMISES TO CALIFORNIA. ALL OF THESE ARE PRINCIPLES THAT ANY. WORK PLAYERS IN THE DEBT SETTLEMENT INDUSTRY GUIDE AND DO YOU AGREE WITH. THE BILL ALSO WOULD CHANGE THE RATE STRUCTURE FOR DEBT SETTLEMENT TO REQUIRE THAT A COMPANY. HE NOT THINK YEAH AND I JUST STATING PROVIDE THE PMR. THAT WILL FINANCE OF THE COMPANY. AND THE AND THE COMPLETE. THE MORE THE COMPANY. THE MORE THAT EARN. WITH THAT. SAFEGUARD YOU HAVE THE BEST AS WE HAVE ONE OUR CLIENTS OF ENDING AT DEEPER IN DEBT AND THEY WERE WHEN THEY- AND WITH CREDIT. AND. MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO SECURE WELL PAYING JOBS AND STABLE HOUSING. IT IS ESSENTIAL AS THE EXTENT OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WE ARE AND I'M FULL THAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE FACED WITH THAT THAT THAT THEY HAVE ACCUMULATED IN ORDER TO SURVIVE. BUT THE ONE. ACTIONS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- GROUP OF US BACK. IN THAT SOME INDUSTRY. DO NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF DESPERATE CONSUMERS WE HAVE A CHANCE TO PUT GUARD WELCOME PLACE NOW BEFORE THE HARM IS DONE. WE URGE YOUR EYES OUT. THANK YOUR TESTIMONY ARMS WATER IF YOU COULD CLOSE TO THE A SECOND WHEN IT'S IN SUPPORT. YES AND MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IN PLACE OF VIRGINIA MARADA WE WILL HAVE.

THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR HERE- PUTTING GOOD WORK TODAY- SO WELL I JUST HAD A QUESTION FOR ONE OF THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION FOR MURDER GUIDE STEEN CCIDENT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION ABOUT THIS INDUSTRY NIGHT I CERTAINLY WHEN I FIRST LOOKED AT THIS WAS WAS YOU KNOW HOW TO MISIMPRESSIONS ABOUT HOW THIS INDUSTRY WORKS AND THE CUSTOMERS ARE SO JUST CURIOUS IF YOU. GIVE US A LITTLE BIT COLOR ABOUT THAT'S UP TO THE CUSTOMER. DURING THIS ISSUE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GABRIEL THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION I'M GOING TO DEFER TO SHE BOMBS HE'S ACTUALLY- WITH THREE MINUTES ON CAN TAKE THIS QUESTION. THANK YOU NUMBER AND THANK YOU MARGARET. ASSEMBLYMEMBER THE TYPICAL DEBT SETTLEMENT CUSTOMER IS WHAT WE CALL HOST PRIME- IT TENDS TO BE A DUAL INCOME HOUSEHOLDS MAKING A- ABOVE AVERAGE INCOME INTO A FINANCIAL HARDSHIP HAS TAKEN PLACE THAT TYPICALLY IS ONE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY HAS. SOME OR ALL OF THEIR INCOME THEY HAD AN UNFORESEEN MEDICAL EVENT OR SOME OTHER BIG LIFE EVENT LIKE A DIVORCE AND IN THE EVENT HAS A PROFOUND BUT TEMPORARY IMPACT ON THEIR FINANCIAL STATE WHICH MEANS THAT THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY ALL OF WHAT THEY ARE TO THEIR PICTURE CREDITOR. FOR SOMETHING. OR THE MUCH OF THE OTHER PART OF THIS BECAUSE THE TEMPORARY IS OUR RATES OF RECIDIVISM ARE INCREDIBLY LOW AT FREEDOM IT'S LESS THAN 1% BUT LESS THAN 1% OF CONSUMERS WHO WOULD COME BACK TO US HAVING COMPLETED US ALL THE PROGRAM. THIS IS NOT A PRODUCT FOR LOW INCOME CONSUMERS- IT I THEIR PROBLEM THAT IS- ON THE SPECTRUM OF DEBT SOLUTIONS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN CREDIT COUNSELING AND BANKRUPTCY. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I JUST OF MY MISTER VICE CHAIR MAKE A FEW COMMENTS- AND I'VE I JUST FIRST WANTED TO START WITH THE TO THINKING ALL. MEASURE YOU KNOW THE FINE. ASSISTANCE ONE THAT IS RIGHT RUBIO SAN AND- YOU KNOW FOR PREDATORY BEHAVIOR. AND I THINK WE'VE SEEN A LOT IN THIS COMMITTEE OF YOU KNOW THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIAS ARE OFTEN THOSE ARE TARGETED AND EXPLOITED. IN WAYS THAT ARE REALLY REALLY DAMAGING AND PUT THEM INTO- CYCLES OF A DAD AND PARTY THERE JUST. TORN FULL TIME FOR TRUMP. VERY VERY MUCH OF. YOUR ATTENTION FOCUSED OF THESE ISSUES AND- WE'VE BEEN A- CHAMP ON THEM. SAYS WHEN I GET A WE JUST TOOK ECHO MY COMMENTS WITH THE TWO. YOUR YOUR AT THE MAY MANY CON. WE HAD ABOUT THE BILL I AWFUL. MEN'S I THIS ISSUE INITIALLY WERE WITH OF THAT PERSON THAT WE YOU KNOW LIKE TO BE LOOKING AT AT A PREDATORY BEHAVIOR IN AND AN UNSAVORY INDUSTRY CAME AWAY WITH A LITTLE BIT OF A MORE NUANCED IMPRESSION ABOUT WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT AND THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY ACTORS IN THE SPACE THAT ARE PROVIDING VALUABLE SERVICES TO CALIFORNIANS AND HELPING PEOPLE WHO ARE IN NEED- AND THEN CERTAINLY I THINK THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE THAT THEY'RE BAD ACTORS WILL GIVE ME SOME PAUSE WISE AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS WITH THE SMALL. THERE ISN'T A LOT. RESEARCH OR DATA. RENTS ON HOW WHY. DODD USER BEHAVIOR MAY BE. RIGHT SO WE DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW AND SO I WAS LIKE SORT OF SCRATCHING MY HEAD IS THIS IS THIS A COMPELLING CASE FOR- FOR BROAD BASED REGULATION OR IS THERE A COMPELLING CASE HERE FOR MAYBE JUST MORE INCREASE ENFORCEMENT TO TRY TO. REALLY ABOUT AFTER WITHOUT. IMPOSING BE NEGATIVE ACTS OR NEXT EXTERNALITIES UNNECESSARY COSTS ON THE FOLKS WHO ARE RUNNING LEGITIMATE BUSINESSES SO- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE ALL THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE ENGAGED IN VERY ROBUST CONVERSATIONS WITH. FOLKS ARE PUBLIC. TEAMS LIKE YOUR- LINE OF BREAST. I'M I CERTAINLY WANT TO STAND IN THE WAY THAT PROP. I THINK INTENTIONS HERE ARE. ARE VERY GOOD AND SO I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY.

THERE ARE VERY GOOD ACTORS IN THE SPACE WHO ARE TRULY HELPING PEOPLE WHO PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO NEED THE HELP COMING OUT OF THIS CRISIS OR IN THE MIDDLE THIS CRISIS. I ALSO DO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE RIGHT AND SO IT'S FIGURE OUT WHERE THAT LINE IS AND HOW DO YOU CREATE- SURGICAL AT STRATEGIC REGULATION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT HAVING AN ANTENNA CONSEQUENCES WILL STILL PUTTING.
