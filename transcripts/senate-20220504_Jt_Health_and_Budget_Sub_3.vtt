RESPONDING TO THE QUESTION

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:40.030

BASED ON CURRENT ENROLLMENT- IT

00:47:02.419 --> 00:47:03.787

THAT WE'RE- TO DO. THINGS

ME THE PIE- TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

00:51:22.979 --> 00:51:23.547
THIS THIS DEFAULT AS WELL. BE

00:51:23.613 --> 00:51:24.948

COOPS AND I'M- IT IN A

00:51:29.953 --> 00:51:31.221
NATIONALLY WASN'T INCLUDED IN

00:51:31.288 --> 00:51:32.022
THE PLANS WERE SAYING THAT'S

00:51:32.088 --> 00:51:34.491
TERRIBLE DO YOU HAVE TO INCLUDE.

00:51:34.558 --> 00:51:36.259

WILL FURTHER DESTABILIZE THE

00:51:46.336 --> 00:51:47.370
PROVIDER NETWORK IS THAT WHAT

00:51:47.437 --> 00:51:50.974
I'M HEARING. YES LET ME CLARIFY

00:51:51.041 --> 00:51:54.678

THAT THE ENROLLMENT RULES THAT

00:51:56.847 --> 00:51:59.182

00:51:59.249 --> 00:52:00.984

THINKING THAT PROVIDERS- SO I

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:28.011
THINK IT'S A MATTER OF- NEEDING%

00:52:28.078 --> 00:52:29.379
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO

00:52:29.446 --> 00:52:31.515
EVALUATE THAT. AND THEN.

00:52:31.581 --> 00:52:33.950
ADDITIONALLY QUESTIONS AS TO IF

00:52:34.017 --> 00:52:37.087
KAISER WAS GOING TO GROW BY 25%

00:52:37.153 --> 00:52:42.759

PROBABLY HAVE LOT OF OPEN

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:51.768
QUESTION ABOUT WHAT BEING

00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:52.636

00:53:02.445 --> 00:53:03.613
WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST MAKE

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.948
NOTE THAT THE OTHER ISSUE THAT

00:53:05.015 --> 00:53:06.650
THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:53:06.716 --> 00:53:08.485
RATE SETTING FOR QT IS REALLY

00:53:08.552 --> 00:53:10.520
NOT AS RELATED TO THIS PLAN AS

00:53:10.587 --> 00:53:13.890
YOUR OVERALL ISSUES WITH. RATE

00:53:13.957 --> 00:53:17.227
SETTINGS FOR QT. SO THERE IS A

00:53:17.294 --> 00:53:18.762
DIRECT LINKAGE BETWEEN THIS

00:53:18.828 --> 00:53:20.931

00:53:20.997 --> 00:53:23.567

PROPERTY TODAY AND THE FLAWS

00:53:30.774 --> 00:53:32.976
THAT WE- SEE IN THAT PROCESS.

00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:35.445
BUT THE PROPOSAL WILL EXACERBATE

00:53:35.512 --> 00:53:37.380
THOSE ISSUES. BECAUSE IT REMOVES

00:53:37.447 --> 00:53:39.616
A HEALTHIER SUBSET. OF MEMBERS

00:53:39.683 --> 00:53:41.484
BEING SERVED BY LOCAL PLANS OR

PLANTS WITH THAT EVEN MORE DISK

00:53:47.624 --> 00:53:50.427
. I YOU POPULATION. BUT I THINK

00:53:50.493 --> 00:53:52.195
IT REALLY MEANS THAT WE NEED-

00:53:52.262 --> 00:53:54.631
GUARDRAILS. IF THAT WAS A

00:53:54.698 --> 00:53:57.067
PROCESS BY WHICH HE YES ENSURE

00:53:57.133 --> 00:53:58.268
THAT THE REFACTORED CONSIDERED.

00:53:58.335 --> 00:53:59.636
ADEQUATELY AND APPROPRIATELY IN

00:53:59.703 --> 00:54:08.378
THE RESETTING PROCESS. OKAY SO.

00:54:08.445 --> 00:54:09.846

TO GO AHEAD CENTER- I A N. AND

00:54:13.883 --> 00:54:14.618
THEN BUT DON'T FOR YOUR

00:54:14.684 --> 00:54:16.820

VERY TO CONTINUE THE COME.

00:54:27.397 --> 00:54:28.498
BECAUSE I AM HEARING THAT THE UP

00:54:28.565 --> 00:54:30.500
BY. THAT NSS AND DON'T ASSIST

00:54:30.567 --> 00:54:32.002
OPPOSE THE JUST HAVE THE- TO

00:54:32.068 --> 00:54:33.503
HAVE ITS REALLY HIGH TO GET

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:34.771
TAKEN CARE CONGRESS. BECAUSE

00:54:34.838 --> 00:54:35.872
IT'S A MATTER OF GETTING IN TO

00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:37.440
SEE IF THEY ACTUALLY OPPOSED

00:54:37.507 --> 00:54:39.409
ONCE THEY SEE THE DETAILS ALL

00:54:39.476 --> 00:54:41.077
RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO AT

00:54:41.144 --> 00:54:42.846
LEAST ME PAS ON THAT ISSUE. BUT

00:54:42.912 --> 00:54:43.546
ANOTHER QUESTION THAT I HAD JUST

00:54:43.613 --> 00:54:44.681
INITIALLY WAS. GIVEN THAT WE'RE

00:54:44.748 --> 00:54:47.183
HEARING FROM JUST EVERY INDUSTRY

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:47.784
HOW OTHERS WORK FOR SHORTAGES

00:54:47.851 --> 00:54:49.819
HOW ARE YOU GONNA. FILL THE SEAT

00:54:49.886 --> 00:54:52.288
HELD A POSITION SAID THERE'S AN

00:54:52.355 --> 00:54:54.691
INFLUX OF ENROLLEES BUT THEN.

00:54:54.758 --> 00:54:56.459
OUR IS- SOMEWHAT SADDENED WITH

00:54:56.526 --> 00:54:58.495
WHAT I HEARD IN TERMS OF HOW

00:54:58.561 --> 00:55:00.630
THESE OTHER FACILITIES TRAIN

00:55:00.697 --> 00:55:02.032
PEOPLE AND THEN THEY END UP

00:55:02.098 --> 00:55:04.167
LEAVING AND- THEN EVEN COMPETING

00:55:04.234 --> 00:55:07.237
WITH- SIGNING BONUSES AND- AND I

00:55:07.303 --> 00:55:08.938
THINK THAT THAT IS SOMETHING

00:55:09.005 --> 00:55:12.108
THAT DOES GIVE ME GREAT PAUSE

00:55:12.175 --> 00:55:13.543
BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT AS-

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:16.880
THEY- FACED AT THAT. TO TEACH

00:55:16.946 --> 00:55:17.881
MEDICAL SYSTEM. WE WHEN THERE

00:55:17.947 --> 00:55:21.651
ARE RECRUITING. TOP NOTCH. AND

00:55:21.718 --> 00:55:23.186
GIVING THESE YOU KNOW BIG

00:55:23.253 --> 00:55:25.021
BONUSES. THEY ARE TAKING QUALITY

00:55:25.088 --> 00:55:26.556
PROVIDERS AWAY FROM THE SMALLER

00:55:26.623 --> 00:55:28.291
FACILITIES AND I THINK THAT

00:55:28.358 --> 00:55:29.959
SOMEWHERE IN THERE WE HAVE TO

00:55:30.026 --> 00:55:34.264
EXPLORE THE ABILITY TO MAYBE.

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:36.533
CAPS IN ABILITY TO THE TO RECOUP

00:55:36.599 --> 00:55:42.005
FROM. THESE FACILITIES AT.

00:55:42.072 --> 00:55:43.440
PERSONNEL AND NOW THEY LOSE IT

00:55:43.506 --> 00:55:44.641
IS THAT CAN MORE IN I THINK THAT

00:55:44.708 --> 00:55:47.610
WE AS A- OR TO THAT. IF WE ALLOW

00:55:47.677 --> 00:55:50.346

BE MORE COMPETITIVE IN HIRING

00:56:36.326 --> 00:56:37.927

NECESSARY TO PAY. AND TO COMPETE

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:04.587
WITH THOSE IN THE COMMERCIAL

00:57:04.654 --> 00:57:05.789
MARKET PLACE WHICH WILL BE

00:57:05.855 --> 00:57:07.590
DIFFICULT IT'S CERTAINLY. AN

00:57:07.657 --> 00:57:09.025
ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING

00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:11.060
WITH. SINCE I CAME UP HERE

00:57:11.127 --> 00:57:12.862
ALMOST TEN YEARS AGO. BUT WITH

00:57:12.929 --> 00:57:13.997
SOMETHING WE NEED TO PURSUE AND-

00:57:14.063 --> 00:57:15.698

RECONCILE THE OPPOSITION. WITH

00:57:21.805 --> 00:57:24.140
THE PROPOSAL. AND WHAT I HEARD

00:57:24.207 --> 00:57:27.777
FROM. THE DIRECTOR WAS. WITH

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:30.246
REGARD TO FQHCS I WAS TOLD THAT

00:57:30.313 --> 00:57:31.748
ONE OF THE CONCERNS WAS THAT

00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:33.283
THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW KAISER

00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:35.518
TO START. BOOKING SLOTS SO TO

00:57:35.585 --> 00:57:38.054
SPEAK OR TAKING- TAKING

POSITIONS- AND HAVING TO KAISER

00:57:41.224 --> 00:57:42.091
PATIENTS BECAUSE OUR MEDICAL

PATIENTS CARED FOR AN FQHC

00:57:44.427 --> 00:57:46.896
FACILITIES. AND WHEN I HEARD WAS

00:57:46.963 --> 00:57:49.032
NO THE PROPOSAL'S GONNA. LIMIT

00:57:49.098 --> 00:57:51.067
THE USE OF FACILITIES IN THIS

00:57:51.134 --> 00:57:53.102
CASE A PROPOSAL TO KAISER BRICK

AND MORTAR FACILITIES NOT. FQHCS

00:57:55.672 --> 00:57:57.507
SO THAT WOULD SEEM TO ONE

00:57:57.574 --> 00:57:59.576
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. I WAS TOLD

00:57:59.642 --> 00:58:01.711
WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT

00:58:01.778 --> 00:58:04.647
THAT- LET THE LOCAL PLANS ARE

00:58:04.714 --> 00:58:06.349
GONNA BE LEFT WITH THE SICKEST

SEVENTEEN COUNTIES SUBSTANTIAL

00:58:18.795 --> 00:58:20.463
NUMBER OF COUNTIES I GUESS MY

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:22.131
QUESTION IS ISN'T KAISER

00:58:22.198 --> 00:58:23.733
TREATING THE SAME PATIENTS TODAY

00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:25.635
THAT KAISER WILL BE TREATING.

00:58:25.702 --> 00:58:27.904
TOMORROW IN THE IN THE AT LEAST

00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:29.906
IN SOME SENSE OF THE WORD AND

00:58:29.973 --> 00:58:31.975
HOW DOES THAT LEAVE THE LOCAL

00:58:32.041 --> 00:58:32.942
CLANS WITH QUOTE THE SICKEST

00:58:33.009 --> 00:58:35.211
PATIENTS. IN IN THIS CASE THE

00:58:35.278 --> 00:58:36.713
CASE IS GOING TO BE TRUE THEIR

00:58:36.779 --> 00:58:38.281
LIMITS ON. THE NUMBER OF

00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:39.849
PATIENTS THAT- AND WHO THE

00:58:39.916 --> 00:58:42.185
PATIENTS ARE THE TRANSITION TO

00:58:42.252 --> 00:58:44.254
KAISER IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.

00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:46.623
AND THE 25% INCREASE OVER FIVE

00:58:46.689 --> 00:58:48.358
YEARS IS REALLY NOT MUCH OF AN

00:58:48.424 --> 00:58:49.692
INCREASE IN MY GUESS IS A

00:58:49.759 --> 00:58:51.861
SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE 25%

00:58:51.928 --> 00:58:53.763
WILL BE. THOSE KAISER COMMERCIAL

00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:56.065

WOULDN'T BE GOING TO. THE LOCAL

00:59:01.771 --> 00:59:03.806
PLANS ANYWAY SO IF YOU HAVE A

00:59:03.873 --> 00:59:05.708
LIMIT ON FQHC USAGE AND YOU

00:59:05.775 --> 00:59:08.111
HAVE. TO PROVIDE FOR RISK

00:59:08.177 --> 00:59:09.612
ADJUSTED CAPITATION AND

00:59:09.679 --> 00:59:11.981
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME.

00:59:12.048 --> 00:59:14.284
MATHEMATICS THAT NEEDS TO GO

00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:15.084
INTO THAT TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS

00:59:15.151 --> 00:59:17.120

PARTICULAR PROPOSAL OTHER THAN.

RIGHT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME

00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:45.248
SECURITY DIFFERENCE THERE THAT

00:59:45.315 --> 00:59:46.950
NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR THE

00:59:47.016 --> 00:59:48.484
LOCAL PLANS WON'T GET TO TAKE

00:59:48.551 --> 00:59:50.687
CREDIT FOR THE CARE THAT KAISER

PROVIDES. THESE PATIENTS AND WE

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:56.192

OF THE ISSUES YOU RAISE WHICH

01:00:55.885 --> 01:00:58.454
IS. HAIDAR CONTRACTING WITH

WANT TO START WITH THAT- ALSO. I

01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:11.100

LANGUAGE IS ADOPTED ON THAT

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:56.079
PARTICULAR ISSUE I THINK IT

01:01:56.145 --> 01:01:58.214

OF THE RESPECTIVE MEMBERSHIP

01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:58.007
THAT WE SERVE- SO AGAIN IT'S

01:02:58.074 --> 01:03:00.343
LANGUAGE AROUND PROCESS. TO

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:02.545
ENSURE THAT THE RATE YOU IN FACT

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.213
MATCH THE REST WHICH LEAVES YOU

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.215
NOT TODAY. SO IF WE IN FACT

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:07.650
WE'VE FOOD IF WE IN FACT GET IT

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:10.052
RIGHT WITH RESPECT TO THE RISK

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:12.255
ADJUSTED CAPITATION FORMULA. TO

01:03:12.321 --> 01:03:13.923
PROPERLY ACCOUNT FOR WHO'S

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:18.161
TREATING- IN. TERMS OF ACUITY.

01:03:18.227 --> 01:03:21.230
THAT SHOULD SAY. THAT PARTICULAR

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:27.336
ISSUE CORRECT. YES I THINK IF WE

01:03:27.403 --> 01:03:29.071
HAVE PROPOSED PACIFIC LANGUAGE

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:31.207
ON THAT AND SHOULD THAT BE

01:03:31.274 --> 01:03:33.409
INCLUDED IN THE TRAILER BILL OR

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:36.913
POLICY BILLS- I THINK THAT WOULD

01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:39.982
ALLEVIATE THE CONCERNS AROUND-

01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:41.984
THE RATE ISSUES GIVEN THAT THERE

01:03:42.051 --> 01:03:44.487
WOULD BE TRANSPARENCY AND A

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:47.723
PROCESS- SO AGAIN ANYTHING IT

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:49.125
GOES BACK TO THE AMENDMENTS THAT

01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:50.726
WE PROPOSE AND THOSE BEING

01:03:50.793 --> 01:03:53.196
CONSIDERED AND ADOPTED. RIGHT

01:03:53.262 --> 01:03:55.097
LET ME AS ONE OF THE THING AND

01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:56.632
NOBODY'S I DON'T THINK ANYBODY

01:03:56.699 --> 01:03:58.100
SPOKEN ABOUT IT BUT THIS

01:03:58.167 --> 01:03:59.735
ADMINISTRATIVE FEE WHERE THERE'S

01:03:59.802 --> 01:04:01.904
CONTRACTS IN THEIR SUBCONTRACTS

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:03.906
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHAT

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:04.774
WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE SHIFTING

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.175
FROM A SUBCONTRACTING MODEL TO

01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:07.877
IT THE CONTRACT MODEL SO INSTEAD

01:04:07.944 --> 01:04:09.979
OF A LOCAL PLAN HAVING

01:04:10.046 --> 01:04:10.913
RESPONSIBILITY AND THEN SUB

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.848
CONTRACTING BECAUSE YOUR CARE

01:04:12.915 --> 01:04:14.350
FOR KAISER RELATED PATIENTS

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:15.785
CAUSES GETTING THE CONTRACT

01:04:15.851 --> 01:04:18.487
DIRECTLY. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT

01:04:18.554 --> 01:04:20.256
THE ADMINISTRATIVE FEE DO WE DO

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:22.124
WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS

01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:23.159
ADMINISTRATIVE FEE IN THE

01:04:23.226 --> 01:04:25.661
PROPOSAL THE LOCAL PLANS NEED TO

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:28.097
HAVE TIME TO WEAN THEMSELVES THE

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:32.401
PLANS OFF OF THE. ADMINISTRATIVE

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:35.037
FEE WHATEVER IT IS. SO I'D SAY I

01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:35.738
MEAN AT FIRST ON THE

01:04:35.805 --> 01:04:36.973
ADMINISTRATIVE FEES ARE

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:39.408
DEPENDENT I THINK A LOT OF.

01:04:39.475 --> 01:04:41.911
MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THEIR- AND

01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:43.379
I THINK IT'S BEEN YOU KNOW THE

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:46.082
AMOUNT THAT IS RETAINED BY LOCAL

01:04:46.148 --> 01:04:48.517
PLAN HAS BEEN MISSTATED. AND SO

01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:50.987
JUST TO CONFIRM LOCAL PLANS

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:52.788
TODAY RETAIN 2% AS YOU

01:04:52.855 --> 01:04:55.858
INDICATED- AND AN ADMINISTRATIVE

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:58.661
RATE- TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:01.163
ADDITIONAL. COSTS ARE NOT

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:03.165
PASSED. HI THERE BECAUSE HI

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:05.701
THERE IS NOT- PROVIDING CERTAIN

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:06.902
SERVICES THAT ARE COVERED BY

01:05:06.969 --> 01:05:08.604
MEDICARE OUT OF THAT ADDITIONAL

01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:10.539
FUNDING ACTUALLY GOES TO

01:05:10.606 --> 01:05:12.041

01:05:19.448 --> 01:05:20.750
CLARIFY THAT OUT OF. THE GATE

01:05:20.816 --> 01:05:22.518
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:23.886
QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS ABOUT IT.

01:05:23.953 --> 01:05:24.887

01:10:08.437 --> 01:10:10.940
BIG PROPOSAL AND ITS NEW- AND

01:10:11.006 --> 01:10:13.208

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:16.111
OF ONE OF THE PIECES THAT UP FOR

01:10:16.178 --> 01:10:18.080
ME IS IMPORTANT IS SINCE TO

01:10:18.147 --> 01:10:20.015

AGGREGATE RATE- AND TO ADD TO

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:24.553
THE CARE THAT WE HAVE IN OUR

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:27.122
COMMUNITIES KNOWING THAT WE ME-

01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:29.058
BUT YOU KNOW WE MAY OR MAY NOT

01:10:29.124 --> 01:10:30.693
BENEFIT FROM A PLAN LIKE THIS.

01:10:30.759 --> 01:10:33.429
AND WHILE THE STATE BENEFITS-

01:10:33.495 --> 01:10:36.298
YOU KNOW I DO WONDER WE AND WE

01:10:36.365 --> 01:10:38.000

THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:55.651
THE STATE BUT I STILL THINK ARE

01:10:55.718 --> 01:10:57.353
VERY IMPORTANT COUNTIES. WITH

01:10:57.419 --> 01:10:59.221
VERY DIFFERENT COMMUNITY

STRUCTURES. OF CARE THAT ARE

01:11:02.124 --> 01:11:04.093
INTO GOING TO POTENTIALLY BE A

01:11:04.159 --> 01:11:05.894
PART OF THIS SO ONE OF THE

01:11:05.961 --> 01:11:07.896
QUESTIONS I ASKED AND THIS IS

01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:10.165
FOR THE DIRECTOR- IS WHY NOT

RECEIVED AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.908
IMPLIED. BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT

01:11:19.975 --> 01:11:23.812
IN A SYSTEM OF CARE- DISRUPTING

01:11:23.879 --> 01:11:25.381
EVEN IF THE DISRUPTION HAS A

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:27.983
POSITIVE OUTCOME- EATING CAUSES

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:30.052
A MOMENT OF CONCERN AND-

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:31.553
CERTAINLY CONFUSE YOU KNOW A

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:33.922
LACK OF CLARITY SO I WANT TO

01:11:33.989 --> 01:11:35.891
RECAST THAT. WHY NOT JUST

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:38.861
EXEMPTS. CLUB COUNTIES THAT

01:11:38.927 --> 01:11:42.164

BUSINESS SO. IT WOULD BE

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.214
EXPANDING AS WE TALKED ABOUT THE

01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:00.449
TWENTY TWO THIS WOULD BE THE

01:12:00.516 --> 01:12:02.551

HAPPY TO CREDIT ENGAGE IN THOSE

01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:19.768
CONVERSATIONS TO CONSIDER HOW TO

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:20.869
PROVIDE THAT. BUT INTERACTION WE

01:12:20.936 --> 01:12:23.272

01:12:31.647 --> 01:12:33.649
IF COMMUNITIES AND COUNTIES FEEL

01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:35.250
THE NEED TO BE EXPLICITLY TOLD

01:12:35.317 --> 01:12:37.152
YOU'RE NOT IN. JUST BECAUSE IT

01:12:37.219 --> 01:12:38.887

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:47.096
PRECEDENT FOR OTHER TYPES OF

01:12:47.162 --> 01:12:47.996
MODELS- I THINK COMMUNITY SHOULD

01:12:48.063 --> 01:12:50.232
BE AWARE WHETHER EACH YOU KNOW

01:12:50.299 --> 01:12:51.633
IT COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.902
THEM- SO. FOR ME THAT

01:12:53.969 --> 01:12:55.804
DISTINCTION AS MEANINGFUL- TO

01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:57.406
STATE WELL YOU'RE NOT ON THE

01:12:57.473 --> 01:12:59.208

THIS IS- FOR ALL REALLY INVOLVED

01:13:13.489 --> 01:13:15.557
AND WHOEVER WANTS TO JUMP IN. WE

01:13:15.624 --> 01:13:17.092
ARE NOT SEEN A DIRECT BILL IN

01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:19.495
FRONT OF US HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT

01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:20.896
THERE'S TWO PATHS THAT ARE BEING

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:22.097
EXPLORED A DIRECT BILL- THAT'S

01:13:22.164 --> 01:13:23.532
COMING THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY. AS

01:13:23.599 --> 01:13:25.267

WHERE IS THE NEGOTIATION AND HOW

01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:36.912
FAR WEAK. AND TRULY THAT HAS NOT

01:13:36.979 --> 01:13:38.914
HAPPENED WITH THIS. IT HAS NOT

01:13:38.981 --> 01:13:41.817
HAPPENED AND I AM CURIOUS WHAT

01:13:41.884 --> 01:13:43.185
ARE. WHAT'S THE PROCESS FOR

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:44.720
AMENDMENTS ARE WE REALLY. TO

01:13:44.787 --> 01:13:47.956
MOVE SOMETHING FORWARD- WITHOUT

01:13:48.023 --> 01:13:49.658
TAKING THIS INPUT AND SOMEONE.

01:13:49.725 --> 01:13:51.760
DELIBERATELY TELLING US WHERE WE

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:53.896
ARE WITH AMENDMENTS- THEY'RE

01:13:53.962 --> 01:13:55.397
JUST IN THIS CONVERSATION

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:56.632
THERE'S BEEN SUGGESTIONS FOR

01:13:56.698 --> 01:13:58.167
MULTIPLE TYPE OF AMENDMENTS IN

01:13:58.233 --> 01:14:00.569
THE FORM OF CLARITY. WHEN ARE

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:02.371
THOSE GOING TO GET IN A BILL OR

GONNA BE PROPOSED FOR THAT

01:14:04.506 --> 01:14:06.175
THAT'S AGREED UPON. SO I'M

01:14:06.241 --> 01:14:08.443
HOPING THAT SOMEONE CAN TELL US-

01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:10.512
WHAT THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS IS

01:14:10.579 --> 01:14:13.649

KNOW IF OTHERS SPEAKERS WANT TO-

01:14:25.861 --> 01:14:27.696

DOCTOR ARE USED AS POINTED OUT

01:14:33.535 --> 01:14:34.036
BEFORE. THERE'S CURRENTLY A

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:36.738
VEHICLE IN THE ASSEMBLY- IN FACT

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:38.674

THIS MAY BE PART OF BUDGET

01:14:56.825 --> 01:14:57.726

01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:02.351
PART OF THIS EQUATION AND YOU

01:17:02.417 --> 01:17:03.785
KNOW AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT

01:17:03.852 --> 01:17:06.455
EVEN THOUGH THERE'S INFORMATION

01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:07.022
OUT THERE- WHETHER IT'S A

01:17:07.089 --> 01:17:08.457
FACTUALLY OR INFORMATION OUT

01:17:08.523 --> 01:17:09.624
THERE OR EVEN PROPOSED

01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:11.193
AMENDMENTS NONE OF THAT IS LAW.

01:17:11.259 --> 01:17:13.028
IT'S NOT LONG UNTIL IT'S IN A

01:17:13.095 --> 01:17:15.163
YOU KNOW IT'S IN A TRAILER BILL

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:19.134
LANGUAGE OR- IN. THE BILL ITSELF

01:17:19.201 --> 01:17:21.436
AND SO FOR ME WITHOUT SEEING ANY

01:17:21.503 --> 01:17:23.538
MOVEMENT ON EITHER OF THOSE I

01:17:23.605 --> 01:17:27.042
DON'T KNOW. WHERE WE ARE AT WITH

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:28.110
THAT AND- IN IN THIS

01:17:28.176 --> 01:17:29.978
CONVERSATION ALONE THERE'S A LOT

01:17:30.045 --> 01:17:32.514
OF VERBAL AGREEMENTS ON POINTS

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:34.282
THAT COULD BE CLARIFIED BUT I'VE

01:17:34.349 --> 01:17:36.818
NOT YET SEEN THOSE PUT INTO

01:17:36.885 --> 01:17:38.520
EITHER FORM OF THE LAW. AND

01:17:38.587 --> 01:17:40.088
PERHAPS THEY WON'T SEE THOSE ANY

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:41.757
TIME SOON- BUT I JUST WANT TO

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:43.725
ENCOURAGE US TO NOT RELY ON

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:45.427
INFORMATION FOR FACT SHEETS

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:47.229
BECAUSE THAT IS NOT THE

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:48.263
EQUIVALENT OF A LAW- IN TERMS

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:50.332
OF. YOU KNOW WHERE THESE

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:52.734
NEGOTIATION GOES- AND FINALLY

01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:54.503
ALL JUST SIT YOU KNOW AND IF

01:17:54.569 --> 01:17:55.771
SOMEONE WANTS TO MENTION THE CAB

01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:57.472
AT ALL CLOSE WITH. JUST

01:17:57.539 --> 01:17:59.574
GENERALLY SAYING THAT TO ME THIS

01:17:59.641 --> 01:18:02.277
IS NOT. I WOULD BE RAISING THESE

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:03.512
ISSUES WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS

01:18:03.578 --> 01:18:04.880
KAISER PERMANENTE HEY SO THIS IS

01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:06.448
TO ME IS NOT ABOUT KAISER

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:10.352
SPECIFICALLY AND- THERE'S NOT A

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:12.220
LACK OF TRUST WITH THAT THE

01:18:12.287 --> 01:18:14.956
ENTITY. THIS IS SIMPLY RIFAT

01:18:15.023 --> 01:18:16.458
REFLECTING THE PERSPECTIVE OF A

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:18.660
LEGISLATOR WHO HAS HAD TO PIECE

01:18:18.727 --> 01:18:22.531
TOGETHER HEALTH CARE- AND WHO

01:18:22.597 --> 01:18:24.900
AND WHEN YOU BRING IN MODELS

01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:25.500
THAT COULD POTENTIALLY DISRUPT

01:18:25.567 --> 01:18:27.936
THAT- YOU. END UP WITH PEOPLE

01:18:28.003 --> 01:18:30.539
WHO DON'T HAVE CARE. AND THAT'S

01:18:30.605 --> 01:18:32.641
TO ME AT THE CORE OF WHERE THESE

01:18:32.707 --> 01:18:34.076
COMMENTS COMMENTS ARE COMING

01:18:34.142 --> 01:18:35.944
FROM- I ALSO YOU KNOW WE OFTEN

01:18:36.011 --> 01:18:39.481
SEE VERY WELL INTENTIONED- BILLS

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:41.483
AND IDEAS COME FORWARD- BUT I

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.452
THINK IT'S UPON US TO JUST MAKE

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:45.320
SURE THAT FOLKS DON'T FALL

01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:47.122
APART- IT YOU KNOW. AND

01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:49.357
COMMUNITIES DON'T END UP WITH

01:18:49.424 --> 01:18:51.159
GOOD INTENTIONS THAT TRANSLATE

01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:53.995
TO. SOMEONE NOT GETTING THE CARE

01:18:54.062 --> 01:18:54.763
THEY NEED BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:56.498
SEE SOMEONE OR BECAUSE THE

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:57.933
MODELS CHANGE- BECAUSE

01:18:57.999 --> 01:18:59.901
REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE. ARE

01:18:59.968 --> 01:19:02.070
SUCH THAT. IT'S NOW CAUSED

01:19:02.137 --> 01:19:05.140
ACCESS ISSUES SO- YOU KNOW THOSE

01:19:05.207 --> 01:19:07.008
ARE MY COMMENTS AND I WANT TO

01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:09.010
THANK EVERYONE EVERYONE HAS BEEN

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:11.413
ON ALL SIDES OF THIS HAS BEEN

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:14.015
INCREDIBLY- HELPFUL THEY'VE BEEN

01:19:14.082 --> 01:19:16.351
RUDE PROACTIVE IN REACHING OUT-

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:17.986
AND I WANT TO COMMEND FOLKS FOR

01:19:18.053 --> 01:19:20.789
ALLOWING US TO REALLY. DIG DEEP

01:19:20.856 --> 01:19:26.194
INTO THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE.

01:19:26.261 --> 01:19:28.497
THANK YOU SIR LIMÓN. I WOULD

01:19:28.563 --> 01:19:32.334
MAKE NOTE- DATS- COURSE PERHAPS

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.602
THE OTHER PARTY SHOULD JUST

01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:34.703
MENTION IS I THINK YOU BROUGHT

01:19:34.769 --> 01:19:37.105
UP CEREMONY IS THAT YOU HAVE THE

01:19:37.172 --> 01:19:37.672
PORTION THAT ACTUALLY WERE

01:19:37.739 --> 01:19:39.975
PUTTING INTO CODE. SO WHAT SO

01:19:40.041 --> 01:19:41.343
WHAT I BUDGET TRAILER BILL A

01:19:41.409 --> 01:19:42.477
BILL AND THEN THERE'S OTHER

01:19:42.544 --> 01:19:44.679
PARTS IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S MORE OF

01:19:44.746 --> 01:19:46.681
AN AGREEMENT IS GONNA BE DONE IN

01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:48.683
OTHER WAYS BUT YET IT'S NOT AND

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:49.684
LAW AND I THINK CERTAINLY SOME

01:19:49.751 --> 01:19:50.785
PEOPLE RAISE THE QUESTION OF.

01:19:50.852 --> 01:19:52.554
HOW FORCIBLE IS THAT RIGHT IT'S

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:54.122
ADDRESS SO- SO ONE OF THINGS

01:19:54.189 --> 01:19:55.790
THAT WE MAY NEED TO LOOK AT IS

01:19:55.857 --> 01:19:57.459
WHAT WE ACTUALLY ARE PUTTING

01:19:57.526 --> 01:19:59.194
CODE WHAT HOW MUCH OF THE

01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:01.830
PROPOSAL IS NOT BEING PUT IN

01:20:01.897 --> 01:20:05.033
TRUST ME YOU KNOW WHAT'S BETTER.

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:07.002
OKAY IF I JUST AS- B. CENTER

01:20:07.068 --> 01:20:08.837
LAMONT JUST FOR MY OWN. TO SO I

01:20:08.904 --> 01:20:10.138
CAN UNDERSTAND GOING. INTO

01:20:10.205 --> 01:20:13.041
TAKING THIS FORWARD- YOU'RE

01:20:13.108 --> 01:20:15.510
CONCERNED ABOUT IF THE COUNTY IS

01:20:15.577 --> 01:20:17.045
NOT IT DOES NOT HAVE A KAISER.

01:20:17.112 --> 01:20:18.780
BRICKS AND MORTAR AND OR PART OF

01:20:18.847 --> 01:20:20.982
THAT. THAT IF THE COUNTY IS NOT

01:20:21.049 --> 01:20:23.018
INVOLVED HELP ME UNDERSTAND HOW

01:20:23.084 --> 01:20:24.452
HOW YOU FEEL LIKE THAT THAT THEN

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:26.421
IMPACTS THEIR LOCAL CARE SYSTEM

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:28.490
IS IT ON THE BORDER ISSUES OR IS

01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:30.659
IT ON SO IT COULD BE I MEAN IT

01:20:30.725 --> 01:20:31.693
COULD BE AND I THINK EVERY

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.562
COUNTY IS VERY DIFFERENT- RIGHT

01:20:33.628 --> 01:20:34.429
YOU HAVE DIFFERENT EMPLOYERS

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:36.364
WITH DIFFERENT PROVIDERS THAT DO

01:20:36.431 --> 01:20:37.899
MULTI COUNTY WORK- AND SO WHEN

01:20:37.966 --> 01:20:39.367
YOU HAVE. ANY LIKE SANTA BARBARA

01:20:39.434 --> 01:20:41.102
COUNTY THAT HAS NO KAISER PER SE

01:20:41.169 --> 01:20:42.871
IS NOT IS GOING TO BE EXEMPT IS

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:44.673
NOT GOING TO BE INVOLVED FOR A

01:20:44.739 --> 01:20:47.108
SONG CAL LOCAL SYSTEM- BUT THEN

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:47.709
YOU HAVE INTERCOUNTY I MEAN I

01:20:47.776 --> 01:20:49.811
HAVE HIGH COMMUTER SO ALL OF

01:20:49.878 --> 01:20:50.845
THIS STARTS TO GET INTERTWINED

01:20:50.912 --> 01:20:52.480
VERY QUICKLY RIGHT IN TERMS OF

01:20:52.547 --> 01:20:53.515
WHERE YOU LIVE AND WHERE YOU

01:20:53.582 --> 01:20:54.916
WORK FROM YOUR EMPLOYER IS.

01:20:54.983 --> 01:20:56.551
WHERE YOU HAVE ACCESS THE

01:20:56.618 --> 01:20:58.720
PROXIMITY OF MILES- AND SO FOR

01:20:58.787 --> 01:21:00.855
ME I THINK ONE OF THE PIECES OF

01:21:00.922 --> 01:21:02.524
CLARITY THAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:05.894
IF THIS APPLIES TO- IF THIS

01:21:05.961 --> 01:21:07.662
DOESN'T APPLY TO A COUNTY

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:09.030
PLEASED TO SAY THAT- AND DON'T

01:21:09.097 --> 01:21:10.966
SAY WILL IT ONLY APPLIES TO ACTS

01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:12.934
SAY IT DOESN'T APPLY TO Y. I

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:14.002
THINK THAT THAT'S PARTICULARLY

01:21:14.069 --> 01:21:15.136
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT HELPS US

01:21:15.203 --> 01:21:17.572
UNDERSTAND. WHAT CARE IS

01:21:17.639 --> 01:21:19.574
AVAILABLE OR WHAT IS NOT A MAN

01:21:19.641 --> 01:21:23.411
WHO THIS PARTICULARLY MAY OR MAY

01:21:23.478 --> 01:21:26.248
NOT DISRUPT. THANK YOU. AND JUST

01:21:26.314 --> 01:21:28.450
. SIR DID YOU HAVE TO VERY

01:21:28.516 --> 01:21:29.751
RELATED TO THIS BEFORE THE A

01:21:29.818 --> 01:21:32.621
LABEL HEALTH OKAY ALL RIGHT SIR

WELL OKAY THERE'S A LOT HERE SO

01:21:38.093 --> 01:21:39.928
I WOULD SAY THAT- I LEARNED A

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:41.396
LONG TIME AGO THAT WE PICK

01:21:41.463 --> 01:21:43.331
WINNERS AND LOSERS IT GENERALLY

01:21:43.398 --> 01:21:44.966
DOESN'T WORK AND I WOULD SAY

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:47.202
THAT CLEARLY HERE PEOPLE FEEL

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:49.404
THAT KAISER IS A WINNER AND THAT

01:21:49.471 --> 01:21:51.473
OUR LOCAL PLANS ARE THE LOSERS

01:21:51.539 --> 01:21:54.142
WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S TRUE IT

01:21:54.209 --> 01:21:54.776
SEEMS THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE THE

01:21:54.843 --> 01:21:57.312
FEELING. ALSO PEOPLE DON'T FEEL

01:21:57.379 --> 01:21:58.980
LIKE THEY'VE BEEN HEARD IS WHAT

01:21:59.047 --> 01:22:01.750
IT SEEMS TO ME AS WELL AND WHEN

01:22:01.816 --> 01:22:03.451
YOU HEAR PEOPLE SOMETIMES YOU

01:22:03.518 --> 01:22:05.186
FIND OUT THAT MAYBE WHAT YOU

01:22:05.253 --> 01:22:06.955
THOUGHT WAS RIGHT ISN'T RIGHT

01:22:07.022 --> 01:22:08.990
AND MAYBE WE CAN FIND A WAY TO

01:22:09.057 --> 01:22:11.693
RESOLVE ISSUES OR AT LEAST MAKE

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:12.927
PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE AN

01:22:12.994 --> 01:22:14.462
OPPORTUNITY TO VOICE THEIR

01:22:14.529 --> 01:22:20.669
CONCERNS I WANT. AT EVERYONE'S

01:22:20.735 --> 01:22:23.371
OPEN TO TALK BUT I FEEL LIKE

01:22:23.438 --> 01:22:25.240
BOTH SIDES ARE STILL COMPLETELY

01:22:25.307 --> 01:22:27.575
IN THEIR OWN CAMPS AND NEITHER

01:22:27.642 --> 01:22:29.244
SIDE WILL PACERS HAPPY BUT I

01:22:29.311 --> 01:22:31.079
DON'T FEEL LIKE OUR LOCAL PLANS

01:22:31.146 --> 01:22:32.914
ARE HAPPY OR FEEL GOOD ABOUT

01:22:32.981 --> 01:22:34.549
THIS PROCESS ONE AND I DON'T

01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:36.484
THINK ANY OF US FEEL I CERTAINLY

01:22:36.551 --> 01:22:37.585
DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE PROCESS

01:22:37.652 --> 01:22:38.620
ONE THING YOU WAKE UP ONE

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:40.522
MORNING AND FIND AT THESE

01:22:40.588 --> 01:22:42.190
NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN GOING ON

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:42.857
AND THEN YOU'RE JUST TOLD- THAT

01:22:42.924 --> 01:22:45.560
THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:47.162
TO CEREMONIES POINT WE HAVE

01:22:47.228 --> 01:22:48.596
NOTHING IN THE LAW WE HAVE

01:22:48.663 --> 01:22:50.165
NOTHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN

01:22:50.231 --> 01:22:52.667
DO TO TRY AND MAKE IT BETTER OR

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:54.769
TRY AND GET TO A POINT WHERE

01:22:54.836 --> 01:22:56.971
EVERYBODY'S A LITTLE HAPPY AND A

01:22:57.038 --> 01:22:58.807
LITTLE UNHAPPY. SO I HAVE A

01:22:58.873 --> 01:23:01.643
COUPLE QUESTIONS- THE FIRST ONE

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:03.411
IS FOR YOU- DIRECTOR BASS

01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:05.547
YESTERDAY WHEN WE MET YOU SAID

01:23:05.613 --> 01:23:08.183
KAISER DOES NOT CROP CONTRACT

01:23:08.249 --> 01:23:11.986
OUT TODAY. EXCEPT FOR MAYBE

01:23:12.053 --> 01:23:13.722
TRAUMA. SO MY QUESTION IS THAT

01:23:13.788 --> 01:23:14.889
IS THAT ACTUALLY TRUE BECAUSE

01:23:14.956 --> 01:23:16.458
THEN I'VE ALSO HEARD FROM LOCAL

01:23:16.524 --> 01:23:18.360
PLANTS THAT KAISER CONTRACTS OUT

01:23:18.426 --> 01:23:20.295
ALL THE TIME. BECAUSE I THINK

01:23:20.362 --> 01:23:22.397
MIKE MY ORIGINAL QUESTION WAS-

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:24.666
WHY IS IT THAT MORE PEOPLE CAN'T

01:23:24.733 --> 01:23:27.202
BE OPEN. TO BEING ENROLLED AT

01:23:27.268 --> 01:23:29.537
KAISER IF YOU HAVE MEDICARE WHAT

01:23:29.604 --> 01:23:31.573
IS IT ONLY HAVE TO BE- SOMEONE

01:23:31.639 --> 01:23:33.775
WHO IS ALREADY HAS TIES OR IS A

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:35.377
MEMBER OF THE FAMILY. AND THEN

01:23:35.443 --> 01:23:37.412
THE RESPONSE WAS IT BECAUSE IT

01:23:37.479 --> 01:23:38.880
DOES NOT CONTRACT OUT EXCEPT FOR

01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:40.915
MAYBE TRAUMA. SO DOES CALL IT

01:23:40.982 --> 01:23:43.084
KAISER CONTRACT OUT FOR

01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:47.589
SERVICES. OTHER THAN TRAUMA. I

01:23:47.655 --> 01:23:49.190
THINK THAT QUESTION YESTERDAY

01:23:49.257 --> 01:23:51.326
REALLY. THE DO CONTRACT THAT WE

01:23:51.393 --> 01:23:52.627
KNOW THE CONTRACT FOR TRAUMA

01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:53.928
HOSPITAL SERVICES I THINK THAT

01:23:53.995 --> 01:23:57.232
THE POINT. COM ABOUT. CARE AND

01:23:57.298 --> 01:23:59.768
EAT THE TEACHER THE BABY'S TAKE

01:23:59.834 --> 01:24:01.102
A PRIMARY CARE WITHIN THEIR

THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE SOME

01:42:08.922 --> 01:42:09.456
INPATIENT ACUTE IT IS WHICH I

PROVIDERS THEN I JUST THINK WE

01:42:20.868 --> 01:42:22.603
NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT WE

01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:24.938
DON'T ENCOURAGE THEM TO POACH

01:42:25.005 --> 01:42:25.572
EVEN MORE FROM THE LOCAL PLANS

01:42:25.639 --> 01:42:27.140
JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:42:27.207 --> 01:42:30.410
ABLE TO HAVE MORE PROVIDERS

01:42:30.477 --> 01:42:31.111

01:42:31.178 --> 01:42:34.248
LOT MORE WORK. WE ARE MY OF MY

01:42:34.314 --> 01:42:35.682
NEXT AND HOPEFULLY FINAL

01:42:35.749 --> 01:42:37.784
QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH LOOKING

READING THE MATERIAL AND I GUESS

01:42:39.186 --> 01:42:41.788
THIS GOES TO THE DIRECTOR TO

01:42:41.855 --> 01:42:43.357

01:42:57.504 --> 01:42:59.406
CREDITED WITH THE LOWER ACUITY

01:42:59.473 --> 01:43:02.242
OF- KAISER MEDICARE PATIENTS

01:43:02.309 --> 01:43:04.211
BECAUSE OF THE SUBCONTRACTING

01:43:04.278 --> 01:43:04.912
ARRANGEMENT WHEN THAT

01:43:04.978 --> 01:43:06.713
SUBCONTRACTING ARRANGEMENT GOES

THAT. SO WE'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR

01:43:23.730 --> 01:43:24.965
WITH OUR COVERAGE OF QUALITY

01:43:25.032 --> 01:43:26.500

UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE METRICS

01:43:49.089 --> 01:43:50.791

THAT CHANGES IMMEDIATE DOES THAT

01:44:13.513 --> 01:44:14.681
ALSO MEAN THAT THERE IS AN

01:44:14.748 --> 01:44:16.883
IMMEDIATE CHANGE FOR THE LOCAL

PATIENCE ISN'T THAT GOING TO

01:44:43.577 --> 01:44:44.645
HAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT IF

THEIR SANCTIONS IT RESULT FOR

01:44:46.346 --> 01:44:47.614

NUMBER OF LIVES FOR. IN QUALITY

01:46:35.756 --> 01:46:38.425
MEASURES I DO. AN ALBUM.

01:46:38.492 --> 01:46:40.961
REQUIREMENTS BUT THOSE WOULD BE

01:46:41.027 --> 01:46:42.796
REPORTED DIRECTLY- AND THEN DID

01:46:42.863 --> 01:46:43.697
QUALITY SCORES THAT ARE

01:46:43.764 --> 01:46:45.198
CURRENTLY BEING RECORDED SO I'VE

01:46:45.265 --> 01:46:46.900
HAD A VERY HIGH QUALITY SCORES

AS- INDICATED BY THEM EARLIER. I

01:46:49.169 --> 01:46:50.203
MEAN BY DEMONSTRATED ON OUR

01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:52.873
QUALITY OF REPORTS ONLINE. BUT

01:46:52.939 --> 01:46:54.741
THOSE WOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE

01:46:54.808 --> 01:46:56.543
LOCAL PLAN. IN THIS WOULD BE

01:46:56.610 --> 01:46:58.378
DIRECTLY ORIENTED JUST TO KAISER

01:46:58.445 --> 01:47:00.447
AND THEREFORE A DEPENDING ON HOW

01:47:00.514 --> 01:47:02.682
THOSE BOARDS ON AVERAGE HITTING

01:47:02.749 --> 01:47:04.251
OF THE LOCAL PLANS- THEY COULD

01:47:04.317 --> 01:47:06.920
SEE A DECREASE- REGARDLESS OF

01:47:06.987 --> 01:47:09.256
THAT THE- PLAN WOULD BE

01:47:09.322 --> 01:47:11.224
RESPONSIBLE FOR. ALL OF THE

01:47:11.291 --> 01:47:12.492
LIVES THAT THEY'RE UNDER THE

01:47:12.559 --> 01:47:14.161
QUALITY SCORES AND IF THEY ARE

01:47:14.227 --> 01:47:16.296
BELOW A CERTAIN LEVEL I WOULD BE

01:47:16.363 --> 01:47:16.897
HOLDING THE MANAGED CARE PLAN

01:47:16.963 --> 01:47:18.165
ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THE QUALITY

01:47:18.231 --> 01:47:20.367
SCORES OF THE DAY ARE SUBMITTING

01:47:20.433 --> 01:47:21.168
TO THE DEPARTMENT WHICH CAN

RESULT IN CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN

01:47:22.469 --> 01:47:24.171
OR SANCTION. DEPENDING ON WHAT

WORK WITH- PLANS. IN REGARDS TO

01:47:45.358 --> 01:47:48.795
THAT ****

01:47:48.862 --> 01:47:50.797
TRACTION OF THE KAISER PATIENTS.

01:47:50.864 --> 01:47:52.866
KAISER RECEIVES NO ADVERSE

01:47:52.933 --> 01:47:54.868
IMPACT OF COURSE BECAUSE OF

01:47:54.935 --> 01:47:56.603
PREVENTATIVE CARE AND THE WAY

01:47:56.670 --> 01:47:58.205
THEY'VE DESIGNED KAISER'S

01:47:58.271 --> 01:47:59.072
PROGRAM. LOCAL PLANS HAVE BEEN

01:47:59.139 --> 01:48:00.740
BENEFITING FROM THE KAISER

01:48:00.807 --> 01:48:02.142
PATIENTS BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN

01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:03.844
THE PRIME CONTRACTOR.

01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:05.812
SUBCONTRACTING TO KAISER WE'RE

01:48:05.879 --> 01:48:06.913
GOING TO REMOVE THAT THE LIGHT

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:08.415
SWITCH GETS FLIPPED OFF. THE

01:48:08.481 --> 01:48:10.350
QUALITY MEASURE SCORES GO INTO

01:48:10.417 --> 01:48:12.485
THE TANK. AND WHAT. WHAT'S THE

01:48:12.552 --> 01:48:14.721
TRANSITION PLAN FOR THE LOCAL

01:48:14.788 --> 01:48:16.690
PLANS. IN OTHER WORDS TAKE IT TO

01:48:16.756 --> 01:48:18.658
TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND TO

01:48:18.725 --> 01:48:19.960
GIVE THE LOCAL PLANTS THE

01:48:20.026 --> 01:48:22.662
OPPORTUNITY. TO SOME HELP

01:48:22.729 --> 01:48:25.565
IMPROVE BUT QUALITY IMPROVE

01:48:25.632 --> 01:48:28.869
QUALITY MEASURES AND PERFORMANCE

01:48:28.935 --> 01:48:30.570
VIS A VIS THE BENCHMARKS THAT

01:48:30.637 --> 01:48:33.240
ARE SET AND FRANKLY FROM OF

01:48:33.306 --> 01:48:34.741
NOTHING'S FAIR CERTAINLY NOT IN

01:48:34.808 --> 01:48:35.876
SACRAMENTO AND CERTAINLY NOT

01:48:35.942 --> 01:48:38.445
UNDER THE DOME BUT I THINK WE

01:48:38.511 --> 01:48:39.913
NEED TO APPLY SOME FAIRNESS

01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:41.648
MEASURE TO THIS AND HAVE SOME

01:48:41.715 --> 01:48:43.683
SPOOL UP OF THIS PARTICULAR

01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:46.052
ASPECT OF THE PROPOSAL IN ORDER

01:48:46.119 --> 01:48:48.521
TO GIVE LOCAL PLANS THE ABILITY

01:48:48.588 --> 01:48:50.957
TO MEET THE TEST. AND IF YOU

KNOW IF THIS PROPOSAL GOES UNITS

01:48:54.027 --> 01:48:57.063
INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY ONE OF

01:48:57.130 --> 01:48:57.797
TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE WERE

01:48:57.864 --> 01:49:01.201
JULY ONE OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY

01:49:01.268 --> 01:49:02.469
THREE THAT'S PROBABLY ENOUGH

01:49:02.535 --> 01:49:04.037
TIME NOT ENOUGH TIME RATHER NOT

01:49:04.104 --> 01:49:06.406
ENOUGH TIME TO TURN THE TITANIC

01:49:06.473 --> 01:49:09.576
HERE SITES I WOULD JUST POINT

01:49:09.643 --> 01:49:12.679
OUT ONE THING ALSO SO- IT WOULD

01:49:12.746 --> 01:49:15.382
BE ONE IT UP FOR JANUARY ONE OF

01:49:15.448 --> 01:49:16.816
TWENTY FOUR TO THAT LEVEL MORE

01:49:16.883 --> 01:49:17.751
TIME TWO THINGS THE LOCAL PLANTS

01:49:17.817 --> 01:49:19.286
CURRENTLY NO I WHAT THEIR

01:49:19.352 --> 01:49:20.620
QUALITY SCORES ARE WITH AND

01:49:20.687 --> 01:49:21.721
WITHOUT HEISER TODAY SO THAT

01:49:21.788 --> 01:49:23.223
WOULD HAVE THE INFORMATION TO BE

01:49:23.290 --> 01:49:25.625
ABLE TO- TO WORK TOWARD SOME OF

01:49:25.692 --> 01:49:28.161
THOSE- IMPROVEMENTS I THINK. OF

01:49:28.228 --> 01:49:29.696
THE THING I WOULD SAY IS HI

01:49:29.763 --> 01:49:30.530
THERE COULD ALSO BE A

01:49:30.597 --> 01:49:32.065
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED RIGHT NOW

01:49:32.132 --> 01:49:34.100
THEY ALSO FOUGHT SUBMIT ALL

01:49:34.167 --> 01:49:35.535
THEIR SCORES AND WHILE THEY ARE

01:49:35.602 --> 01:49:38.505
A HIGH SCORE IN CERTAIN MEASURES

01:49:38.571 --> 01:49:40.373
AND METRICS WITH THE DEPARTMENT

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:41.908
THEY COULD BE UNDER A CERTAIN

01:49:41.975 --> 01:49:43.176
THRESHOLD- NOW THAT THEY ARE

01:49:43.243 --> 01:49:45.745
THEN DIRECTLY CONTRACTED WITH AT

01:49:45.812 --> 01:49:50.650
THE STATE. MEASURES. ENTER

01:49:50.717 --> 01:49:52.919
ACCOUNTABLE ALL- IF THEY ARE LOW

01:49:52.986 --> 01:49:54.587
IN SEARCH MEASURE BUT THE LAW

01:49:54.654 --> 01:49:56.523
THE FIFTY FOR. WE WILL ALSO BE A

01:49:56.589 --> 01:49:58.325
DAY WOULD BE EXPOSED NEW CRAP

01:49:58.391 --> 01:49:59.893
ACTION AND- SAYING. IMMEDIATELY

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:02.062
I JUST LIKE ANY OF OUR OTHER

01:50:02.128 --> 01:50:02.696
DIRECT CONTRACTORS AREN'T THEY

01:50:02.762 --> 01:50:04.097
ALSO GET THE BENEFIT WITH ARE

01:50:04.164 --> 01:50:05.465
NOT EXCEEDING UNDER THE

01:50:05.532 --> 01:50:07.133
SUBCONTRACT BECAUSE WE HOLD THE

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:08.702
PRIVATE PLAN. A GLOBAL SO IT

01:50:08.768 --> 01:50:10.503
GOES BOTH WAYS I THINK YOUR

01:50:10.570 --> 01:50:12.272
POINT IS NOTED IN REGARDS TO THE

01:50:12.339 --> 01:50:14.107
TRANSITION AND HOW WE ARE

01:50:14.174 --> 01:50:17.410
FACTORED THOSE THINGS IN. A TO

01:50:17.477 --> 01:50:22.248
ALLOW FOR ALL INTO T. UNDERSTOOD

01:50:22.315 --> 01:50:23.183
. THREE AND ASSUMED AS MOVING

01:50:23.249 --> 01:50:25.352
FORWARD WELL I. WELL I THINK

01:50:25.418 --> 01:50:27.587
IT'S LIKE THAT USED TO BE IS

01:50:27.654 --> 01:50:29.089
ADVERSELY IMPACTED AS A LOCAL

01:50:29.155 --> 01:50:31.057
PLANS ARE I GUESS IT IS

01:50:31.124 --> 01:50:32.425
CONCEIVABLE THAT KAISER WILL

01:50:32.492 --> 01:50:34.594
ALSO SUFFER SOME ADVERSE IMPACTS

01:50:34.661 --> 01:50:36.896
WELL INCLUDE KAISER IN MY- IN MY

01:50:36.963 --> 01:50:39.299
REQUEST IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHEN

01:50:39.366 --> 01:50:40.000
WE'RE IMPOSING A CHANGE LIKE

01:50:40.066 --> 01:50:43.236
THIS. IT CAN BE SIGNIFICANT AND

01:50:43.303 --> 01:50:45.238
MY ONLY CONTEXT IS HAVING BEEN

01:50:45.305 --> 01:50:46.740
ON HOSPITAL BOARDS WHERE WE'VE

01:50:46.806 --> 01:50:48.375
DEALT WITH QUALITY MANAGEMENT

01:50:48.441 --> 01:50:50.410
BENCHMARKS AND PERFORMANCE AND

01:50:50.477 --> 01:50:51.978
CERTAINLY FROM THE SEVERAL

01:50:52.045 --> 01:50:53.413
HOSPITALS AND I'VE- BEEN

01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:55.815
INVOLVED WITH IT IT'S IT DOESN'T

01:50:55.882 --> 01:50:59.419
HAPPEN OVERNIGHT TO GO FROM RED

01:50:59.486 --> 01:51:01.087
TO GREEN. AND SO MY QUESTION IS

01:51:01.154 --> 01:51:03.323
HOW MUCH TIME YOU GIVING LOCAL

01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:04.524
PLANS AND I'LL INCLUDE KAISER IN

01:51:04.591 --> 01:51:06.860
THE STATEMENT. TO IMPROVE TO GO

01:51:06.926 --> 01:51:08.595
FROM RED TO GREEN IN THE CERTAIN

01:51:08.661 --> 01:51:10.397
AREAS AND I DON'T THINK IT

01:51:10.463 --> 01:51:12.465
SHOULD BE JANUARY ONE OF TWO

01:51:12.532 --> 01:51:15.068
THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR FOR JUST

01:51:15.135 --> 01:51:17.437
TALKING ABOUT IT TODAY THE FACT

01:51:17.504 --> 01:51:19.406
THAT PLANS ARE ABLE TO SEPARATE

01:51:19.472 --> 01:51:20.006
OUT. THE NON KAISER PATIENTS.

01:51:20.073 --> 01:51:21.875
WHEN IT COMES TO QUALITY.

01:51:21.941 --> 01:51:22.976
IMPROVEMENT BENCHMARKS IN THE

01:51:23.043 --> 01:51:24.477
PROCESS DOESN'T REALLY DO IT.

01:51:24.544 --> 01:51:26.913
FOR ME. SO I'M ASKING I GUESS

01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:28.148
YOU AND WE WILL DECIDED HERE

01:51:28.214 --> 01:51:30.016
TODAY. THE WHEN WE'RE MOVING

01:51:30.083 --> 01:51:31.718
THIS PROPOSAL FORWARD THAT WE

01:51:31.785 --> 01:51:34.888
GIVE SOME THOUGHT. AT LEAST IN

01:51:34.954 --> 01:51:37.257
THIS AREA TO PROVIDING. SOME

01:51:37.323 --> 01:51:40.927
STRING. ON THE LOCAL PLANS

RELATED TO QUALITY AND BENCHING

01:51:51.204 --> 01:51:52.038
. SURE WILL DEFINITELY TAKE THAT

01:51:52.105 --> 01:51:54.207
BACK IN THINK THROUGH HOW WE CAN

01:51:54.274 --> 01:51:55.608
DO THAT WE WOULD ALSO NEED TO

01:51:55.675 --> 01:51:58.678
CONSULT WITH OUR ALLIES CMS

01:51:58.745 --> 01:52:00.013
POTENTIALLY AS WELL YOU KNOW

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:01.815
THEY HAVE BROUGHT EXPECTATIONS

01:52:01.881 --> 01:52:03.716

THAT AND HER CAST. THAT HAD BEEN

02:00:20.046 --> 02:00:21.714
KEPT. RECOMMENDATIONS HOW

CORRECT THE NOT UTILIZED OR

02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:26.319
ISSUE. WE ARE WE TO HEAR FROM

THE STATE LOOK FOR TO HAVING

02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:29.355
THOSE THE FACTIONS. REGARDING

02:00:29.422 --> 02:00:32.058
THE HOW YOU RIGHT- THERE ARE A

02:00:32.124 --> 02:00:34.226
VARIETY OF. THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED

02:00:34.293 --> 02:00:36.495
THAT COULD BE AND YOU ATTENTION

02:00:36.562 --> 02:00:37.997
AND MAKE A RISK ADJUSTMENT

02:00:38.064 --> 02:00:40.199
REALLY OFFICE REDEVELOPMENT

02:00:40.266 --> 02:00:42.735
SMART. FOREST PRODUCTS SOMETHING

02:00:42.802 --> 02:00:46.939
LIKE A HIGH. FOR HI BUILDER BUT

02:00:47.006 --> 02:00:49.609
- POLICE- YOU KNOW I DON'T TO

02:00:49.675 --> 02:00:54.380
GET. RATE SETTING COMPLEX AND-

02:00:54.447 --> 02:01:06.459
WITH THAT AT ALL. IT IS. WHERE

02:01:06.525 --> 02:01:09.595
DID YOU MEET HOW FOR UNLIKE

02:01:09.662 --> 02:01:12.264
OTHER MEN THE STATE HAS

02:01:12.331 --> 02:01:14.934
DESPERATE SHE OF THE MAY. THAT

02:01:15.001 --> 02:01:17.937
COURAGE FROM PLAN TO PLAN WE CAN

02:01:18.004 --> 02:01:24.810
- THESE. ANYWAY JEFF.

02:01:24.877 --> 02:01:26.579
METHODOLOGY THAT WE WOULD ACCEPT

02:01:26.646 --> 02:01:28.981
I THINK WE KNOWLEDGE THAT NO

02:01:29.048 --> 02:01:30.883
SINGLE METHODOLOGY IS GOING TO

02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:33.019
BE A 100% ACCURATE BUT MY

02:01:33.085 --> 02:01:33.586
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT IS

02:01:33.653 --> 02:01:35.421
COMMON PRACTICE. TO MAKE

02:01:35.488 --> 02:01:37.556
ADJUSTMENTS TO THAT THE CORRECT

02:01:37.623 --> 02:01:38.924
FOR FLOOD AND THAT IS WHAT WE'RE

02:01:38.991 --> 02:01:40.526
ASKING FOR OKAY ALL RIGHT THAT

02:01:40.593 --> 02:01:41.827
THAT'S HELPFUL TO KNOW I WOULD

02:01:41.894 --> 02:01:43.429
MAKE NOTE THAT CALIFORNIA'S A

02:01:43.496 --> 02:01:44.897
FAIRLY LARGE STATE SO WE'RE THE

02:01:44.964 --> 02:01:46.766
MOST POPULOUS IN THE COUNTRY FOR

02:01:46.832 --> 02:01:48.134
I THINK WE HAVE THE LARGEST

02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:50.870
MEDICAID POPULATION OF ANY- ANY

02:01:50.936 --> 02:01:53.606
STATE- AND SO. IN SOME WAYS AT

02:01:53.673 --> 02:01:55.408
LEAST WE HAVE BIG NUMBERS ON OUR

02:01:55.474 --> 02:01:56.976
SIDE TERMS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

02:01:57.043 --> 02:01:58.711
CORRECTIONS AND SO FORTH- MAYBE

02:01:58.778 --> 02:02:00.913

ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGING WITH- MANY

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:02.341
THINGS THAT ARE IN THEIR COURT%

02:03:02.408 --> 02:03:04.009
REGARDS TO GETTING BACK TO THE

02:03:04.076 --> 02:03:05.311
DEPARTMENT ALSO FOR THESE

02:03:05.377 --> 02:03:06.879
CONSIDERATION IN PIECES. BUT

02:03:06.946 --> 02:03:09.148
ALSO SAY IS WE ARE ALSO USING A

02:03:09.215 --> 02:03:11.016
BROAD ASSUMPTIONS THAT WILL BE

02:03:11.083 --> 02:03:15.020
APPLIED ACROSS ALL PLANS WE ARE.

02:03:15.087 --> 02:03:16.388
LOOKING PASSED. I'M MAKING THIS

02:03:16.455 --> 02:03:22.294
WORK FOR ONLY LOCAL. PLANS ARE.

02:03:22.361 --> 02:03:24.296
YEP ROB- ACTUAR- APPROPRIATE

ADJUST WITHIN OUR RATES- THAT

02:03:25.898 --> 02:03:27.433
CAN BE A- BY BOTH CMS. AND THAT

02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:30.803
CAN ASSERT- IN OFTEN. SEEN THAT

02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:31.670
ESPECIALLY WITH SOME OF THE

02:03:31.737 --> 02:03:33.405
UTILIZATION PROPOSALS BEING PART

02:03:33.472 --> 02:03:35.307
THERE'S NOT AN ACTUAL DIFFERENCE

02:03:35.374 --> 02:03:36.575
BETWEEN LOCAL PLANTS IN THEIR

02:03:36.642 --> 02:03:38.344
COMMERCIAL PLANTS. IT IT BURIES

02:03:38.410 --> 02:03:40.412
A CROSS OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:03:40.479 --> 02:03:42.214
IS WE'RE TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER

02:03:42.281 --> 02:03:44.650
BROADLY AT TO FIND A WAY TO.

02:03:44.717 --> 02:03:46.318
APPROPRIATELY ADJUST BY QB WE

02:03:46.385 --> 02:03:48.921
THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT. WE ALSO

02:03:48.988 --> 02:03:50.623
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

02:03:50.689 --> 02:03:53.058
BUILDING IN. A FOR HIRE CUTIE.

02:03:53.125 --> 02:03:54.994
COPULATION THAT THAT WILL TAKE

02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:56.562
MORE WORK ON QUALITY THOSE ARE

02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:57.663
THINGS THAT WE'VE ALSO SHARED

02:03:57.730 --> 02:03:59.799
WITH THE LOCAL PLANS. IN REGARDS

02:03:59.865 --> 02:04:00.866
TO HOW WE WANT TO MAKE THESE

02:04:00.933 --> 02:04:02.835
ADJUSTMENTS BECAUSE WE KNOW WITH

02:04:02.902 --> 02:04:03.903
THE HIGHER QB POPULATION.

02:04:03.969 --> 02:04:06.205
ACHIEVING EQUALITY SCORES IS

02:04:06.272 --> 02:04:07.973
CHECK MORE CHALLENGING AND WE

02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:11.043
ARE MAKING. A DOES IT. MEAN

02:04:11.110 --> 02:04:12.211
THOSE RESERVATIONS WITH THEM SO

02:04:12.278 --> 02:04:13.879
I THINK. THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY

02:04:13.946 --> 02:04:16.315
COMMITTED TO. MAKING SURE THAT

02:04:16.382 --> 02:04:17.750
THE X. YOU DID JUST MENTION THE

02:04:17.817 --> 02:04:19.285
RISK ADJUSTMENTS WITHIN OUR RATE

02:04:19.351 --> 02:04:20.953
SETTING IS APPROPRIATE. AS YOU

02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:22.822
CLEARLY HEARD- THIS IS SOMETHING

02:04:22.888 --> 02:04:25.825
THAT ALL MEDICAID UP PLANS TO

02:04:25.891 --> 02:04:27.560
HAVE TO JUST FOR WHAT I WOULD

02:04:27.626 --> 02:04:33.866
JUST SAY IS CALIFORNIA'S NOT. HI

02:04:33.933 --> 02:04:34.533

02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:36.368
THE DO AS WELL- SO JUST POINT

02:04:36.435 --> 02:04:38.070
THAT OUT AND AT HIGHS ARE SMALL

02:04:38.137 --> 02:04:41.207
IT'S A SIMILAR ACROSS ON THE

02:04:41.273 --> 02:04:42.875
OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS WHEN

02:04:42.942 --> 02:04:44.777
WE LOOKING AT OUR STAFF AND SAN

02:04:44.844 --> 02:04:46.045

02:04:48.948 --> 02:04:51.984
PROJECTED TO BE HIGHER RISK THAN

02:04:52.051 --> 02:04:53.485
THE COUNTY AVERAGE FOR CHILDREN

02:04:53.552 --> 02:04:55.120
AND ADULT POPULATIONS AND THEIR

02:04:55.187 --> 02:04:56.989
COUNTERPARTS BUT I WOULD KNOW

02:04:57.056 --> 02:04:58.424
THEIR LOWER RISK FOR SENIORS AND

02:04:58.490 --> 02:05:00.793
PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES SO WE

02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:05.164

ULTIMATELY. EIGHT I WILL TALK

02:05:26.619 --> 02:05:27.686
ABOUT KAISER CONTRACT I THINK

02:05:27.753 --> 02:05:28.854
IT'S MANY LIKE IS THAT THIS

02:05:28.921 --> 02:05:30.789
ISN'T MUCH ABOUT THE SPECIFIC

02:05:30.856 --> 02:05:31.857
PLANS WANT THAT WHATEVER PLANS

02:05:31.924 --> 02:05:33.125
ARE BEING TREATED FAIRLY THEY

HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO

02:05:35.728 --> 02:05:37.463
TAKE CARE OF THE PATIENTS RIGHT.

02:05:37.529 --> 02:05:39.398
THAT WE'RE NOT HAVING THESE.

02:05:39.465 --> 02:05:42.001
AVERTED PLANNED- THIS IS- THAT

02:05:42.067 --> 02:05:43.269
TAKES CARE OF A LOWER JUDY SAID

AND- AND- AND HIS STUFF. UP BUT

02:05:46.705 --> 02:05:48.340
THIS IS GETTING DISPROPORTION

02:05:48.407 --> 02:05:49.074
ABOUT OF THE FUNDING AND

02:05:49.141 --> 02:05:51.410
THEREFORE DISADVANTAGING- NO

02:05:51.477 --> 02:05:53.879
SICKER PATIENTS SO- IT IN MY IN

02:05:53.946 --> 02:05:56.782
MY MIND. BE SURE THAT WE HAVE AN

02:05:56.849 --> 02:05:58.517
APPROPRIATE- DISTRIBUTION L.

02:05:58.584 --> 02:06:00.352
RACE RISK ADJUSTMENT IS GONNA BE

02:06:00.419 --> 02:06:02.221
REALLY IMPORTANT AND- I KNOW

02:06:02.288 --> 02:06:03.589
THAT DEPARTMENTS AS ARE WORKING

02:06:03.656 --> 02:06:04.623
ON IT. I HEAR FOR THE LOCAL

02:06:04.690 --> 02:06:07.126
HEALTH PLAN SAID. IF THERE IS A

02:06:07.192 --> 02:06:10.329
YOU KNOW DISTORTION AT THE

02:06:10.396 --> 02:06:12.665
TAILS- AND VOTE IS IF WHAT WE

02:06:12.731 --> 02:06:14.867
CAN TRY TO CORRECT FOR. BUT

02:06:14.934 --> 02:06:15.801
HOLDEN AND- BUT CERTAIN DOES

02:06:15.868 --> 02:06:17.636
INDICATE. THAT- GIVEN SOME OF

02:06:17.703 --> 02:06:19.271

ALSO HISTORY. THAT KAISER

02:06:22.908 --> 02:06:24.276
PERHAPS WOULD HAVE A HEALTHIER

02:06:24.343 --> 02:06:25.678
POTENTIALLY HEALTHIER POPULATION

02:06:25.744 --> 02:06:27.613
IN THE END WE WANNA BE SURE THAT

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:29.014
ANY PLAN WHETHER IT'S KAISER. AS

02:06:29.081 --> 02:06:30.282

OUR PATIENTS- THE- SO DOES

02:06:37.923 --> 02:06:40.726
FOLLOWS ON TO A RATE SETTING- SO

02:06:40.793 --> 02:06:42.027
WHEN THE QUESTION SO OF COURSE

02:06:42.094 --> 02:06:43.862
WE'RE MOVING TO REGIONAL RATE

02:06:43.929 --> 02:06:45.130
SETTING HUNDRED A NEW

RATE THAT KAISER GETS PAID IS

02:06:53.539 --> 02:06:56.175
THAT LIKE A SIMULATION OF THE-

02:06:56.241 --> 02:06:57.977
VARIOUS LOCAL WITH A RISK

02:06:58.043 --> 02:07:02.748
ADJUSTMENT VENTURA- THAT JUST.-HOURS AT A STATEWIDE SAME RATE

02:07:02.815 --> 02:07:04.550

YOU KNOW GONE HAVE THEIR RATES

02:07:07.786 --> 02:07:10.389
SET BASED ON WHERE THEY ARE IF

02:07:10.456 --> 02:07:11.023
THE LOCALITY IN. WHICH REGION

02:07:11.090 --> 02:07:15.394

RATE IS IT GOING TO BE. BUILT

02:07:20.499 --> 02:07:21.734
WELL I GUESS ONE COULD ARGUE

02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:23.502
THAT IF THEY JUST GET ONE

02:07:23.569 --> 02:07:24.603
STATEWIDE RATE THAT'S NOT QUITE

02:07:24.670 --> 02:07:26.071
THE SAME AS- SAYING THAT WELL

02:07:26.138 --> 02:07:27.606
ACTUALLY YOUR RATES CAN BE BASED

02:07:27.673 --> 02:07:28.741
ON YOU HAVE X. NUMBER OF

02:07:28.807 --> 02:07:30.909
ENROLLEES IN THIS AREA IN THIS

02:07:30.976 --> 02:07:31.744
REGION AND THAT'S REGIONALLY IN

02:07:31.810 --> 02:07:33.579

INFERRED ON HYGIENE. ONE THING I

02:14:45.710 --> 02:14:47.546

02:14:47.612 --> 02:14:50.315

02:19:47.979 --> 02:19:50.215
BY PLAN BOB AND ONE OF THE-

02:19:50.281 --> 02:19:52.117
THINGS WE ENCOUNTERED WAS IN ONE

02:19:52.183 --> 02:19:53.451
OF THE PLANTS IN THE AREAS THAT

02:19:53.518 --> 02:19:54.652
ONE OF THE COUNTIES WHERE WE'RE

02:19:54.719 --> 02:19:57.756
WHERE WE REALIZED THAT THERE WAS

02:19:57.822 --> 02:19:59.124
A HUGE SPECIALTY NEED AND WE

02:19:59.190 --> 02:20:01.926
STARTED TO DIVE IN. IT WAS A

02:20:01.993 --> 02:20:02.694
PLAN THERE THAT THEY HAD ALREADY

02:20:02.761 --> 02:20:04.929
STARTED WORK ON SO WE SO PART OF

02:20:04.996 --> 02:20:06.531
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

02:20:06.598 --> 02:20:07.832
KAISER IS NOT THERE TO NECESSARY

02:20:07.899 --> 02:20:09.434

SYSTEM THAT THEY'RE TO BE A

02:20:10.869 --> 02:20:12.737
VALUE ADD SO PART OF THE LEVEL

02:20:12.804 --> 02:20:14.372
OF COMPLICATION AS WELL AS PLANS
