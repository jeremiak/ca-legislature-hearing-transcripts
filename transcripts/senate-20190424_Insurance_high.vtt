TERM INSURANCE COMMISSIONER.

00:07:50.703 --> 00:07:52.004
THIS IS THE LOMA PRIETA

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:53.606
EARTHQUAKE SO IF WE HAD ANOTHER

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:55.141
LOMA PRIETA EARTHQUAKE IN

00:07:55.208 --> 00:07:56.442

ALL THE CAPITAL IN THE ACCOUNT

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.278
WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT.

00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:01.280
IF WE HAD A NORTHRIDGE

00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:03.049
EARTHQUAKE IN CURRENT DOLLARS.

00:08:03.115 --> 00:08:04.116
B. INSURANCE AND CAPITAL WOULD

00:08:04.183 --> 00:08:05.418
COVERAGE.

00:08:05.484 --> 00:08:07.220
IF WE HAD A SAN FRANCISCO

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:08.955
EARTHQUAKE.

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:10.890
IN CURRENT DOLLARS IT WOULD

00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:12.692
COVER HERE.

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:14.827
AND THEN A ONE IN TWO HUNDRED

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:15.928
FIFTY YEAR EARTHQUAKE WHICH

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.263
WOULD BE FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.865
IN CURRENT DOLLARS IS ONLY AT

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:21.100
THE POINT AT WHICH THIS

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.468
CONTINGENT LIABILITY.

00:08:22.535 --> 00:08:23.769
KICKS IN.

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:24.804
THAT'S IT.

00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:26.839
THE QUESTION FOR ALL OF US AS WE

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:30.076
TEND AS PUBLIC POLICY MAKERS TO

00:08:30.142 --> 00:08:32.011
TRYING TO BE HONORABLE TO THE

00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:33.779
FOLKS THAT WE REPRESENT WHEN WE

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:35.448
KNOW ALL THAT WE HAVE TO

00:08:35.514 --> 00:08:37.450
MODERNIZE HE SYSTEM WHEN YES

00:08:37.516 --> 00:08:38.384
THERE WERE DIFFERENT STANDARDS

00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:40.519
OF THE TIME THIS WAS GREAT

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:40.987
TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO.

00:08:41.053 --> 00:08:41.487
WHEN YOU HEAR THOSE OLD

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:43.089
ARGUMENTS BUT THE WORLD HAS

00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:44.824
CHANGED AND INTEREST WHICH IS

00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:45.992
GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT?

00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:48.361
CAN WE REDUCE BY A HUNDRED

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:49.862
MILLION DOLLARS THE AMOUNT OF

00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:51.163
MONEY WE'RE SPENDING.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:56.669
ON REINSURANCE AND PUT THAT.

00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:58.571
INTO BRACING BOLD -- PLACES

00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:00.172
PRIORITIZE WHERE THERE'S A HIGH

00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:01.274
PROPENSITY FOR EARTHQUAKE SMART

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.642
POLICY.

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:04.143
THE COST OF THAT.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.480
IS THIS VERY MINUSCULE.

00:09:07.546 --> 00:09:09.048
CONTINGENT LIABILITY ON

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:11.417
INSURANCE POLICIES.

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:13.219
UP HERE AT THE TOP AND YOU HAVE

00:09:13.286 --> 00:09:15.221
TO GET TO A ONE IN TWO HUNDRED

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:16.555
FIFTY YEAR EVENT BEFORE THAT

00:09:16.622 --> 00:09:17.423
KICKS IN.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.758
ALL THESE OTHERS CREEKS ALREADY

00:09:18.824 --> 00:09:21.494
PAID FOR BY THIS EARLIER DEAL.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.363
IS IT IS IT THE BOTTOM LINE IS.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:25.197
IS THE PERFECT [inaudible]

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:26.799
NO.

00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:28.501
IF ANYTHING WE DO IN GOVERNMENT

00:09:28.567 --> 00:09:30.503
PERFECT BUT WE'RE IN A SITUATION

00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:32.438
WHERE WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:33.806
FACE AN EARTHQUAKE.

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:36.442
AND WE HAVE TO BE SMART ABOUT IT.

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:38.945
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WHEN THEY

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:40.313
CAN WE SPENT SIX MONTHS GOING

00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:41.247
THROUGH THE STUFF DURING THE

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:42.815
BREAK AND I'M GIVING HIM A HARD

00:09:42.882 --> 00:09:45.184
TIME KICKING THE TIRES.

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:45.785
THERE'S AN ISSUE AS TO WHETHER

00:09:45.851 --> 00:09:46.385
THESE ATTACKS.

00:09:46.452 --> 00:09:48.321
I KNOW THAT THE ANALYSIS THAT

00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:48.854
WAS WRITTEN AND NOW BEING

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:50.356
WRITTEN FOR MY UNDERSTAND WE'VE

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:52.024
BEEN CONCEPTS ALSO STATION WITH

00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:54.660
THE ALLEGE COUNSEL'S OFFICE TO

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:55.227
TRY TO GET THEM TO RE WRITE

00:09:55.294 --> 00:09:56.195
THEIR THINKING.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.164
MY ARGUMENT IS A TAXES YOU YOU

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.799
GET YOUR YOUR OBLIGATION TO PAY

00:09:59.865 --> 00:10:01.901
SOMETHING AND IT GOES TO PAY FOR

00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:03.769
CERTAIN GOVERNMENT SERVICES THIS

00:10:03.836 --> 00:10:05.271
IS A CONTINGENT OBLIGATION.

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:07.239
THAT OCCURS AFTER EXTRAORDINARY

00:10:07.306 --> 00:10:09.008
CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE QUESTION

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:10.309
IS FROM A PUBLIC POLICY

00:10:10.376 --> 00:10:12.078
PERSPECTIVE IS IT THE RIGHT

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:13.012
THING TO DO.

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:14.347
WANTS TO ENGAGE IN A DISCUSSION

00:10:14.413 --> 00:10:15.715
OF WHETHER TO TAX I KNOW THAT

00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:17.216
WORDS A BAD WORD.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:19.018
I ALSO DO NOT WANT TO PUT ON ANY

00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:20.619
MEMBER OF EITHER PARTY IN THIS

00:10:20.686 --> 00:10:21.420
HOUSE.

00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:22.989
THE OBLIGATION TO VOTE FOR TAX

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:24.457
BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE THE

00:10:24.523 --> 00:10:26.592
ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE THIS IS

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:28.027
OF CASE OF FIRST IMPRESSION.

00:10:28.094 --> 00:10:30.129
MY IDEA IS POTENTIALLY IT THIS

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:31.330
GETS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY

00:10:31.397 --> 00:10:32.665
TO PUT A PROVISION IN.

00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:34.300
THAT BASICALLY SAYS THIS WILL GO

00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:35.534
INTO EFFECT UNTIL THERE'S A

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:37.169
JUDICIAL DETERMINATION THAT THIS

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:38.204
IS NOT A TAX BECAUSE I DON'T

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:42.074
WANT TO PUT ANYBODY IN A

00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:43.275
POSITION THAT THIS IS A TAX.

00:10:43.342 --> 00:10:44.610
BUT THE IDEA IS AND WHAT PEOPLE

00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:45.211
ARE SAYING OH MY GOD OF THESE

00:10:45.277 --> 00:10:45.778
POLICIES ARE GONNA BE UPSIDE

00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:47.213
DOWN YEAH WHAT'S THE WORLD IN

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:47.813
LOOK LIKE.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.749
AFTER A LARGER THAN IF YOU ADD

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:51.751
UP LOMA PRIETA AND SAN FRANCISCO

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:52.485
WE GOT SOMETHING BIGGER THAN

00:10:52.551 --> 00:10:53.486
THAT.

00:10:53.552 --> 00:10:54.887
WHAT'S THE IMPACT TO EVERYBODY

00:10:54.954 --> 00:10:55.721
IN CALIFORNIA DIRECTLY OR

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:57.289
INDIRECTLY NOT JUST THE HOMES

00:10:57.356 --> 00:10:58.858
THAT ARE THAT THAT ARE THAT ARE

00:10:58.924 --> 00:11:00.326
UPSIDE DOWN BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN

00:11:00.393 --> 00:11:01.227
DESTROYED.

00:11:01.293 --> 00:11:02.695
AND WE CAN HELP PREVENT THAT

00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:04.663
WHAT WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THE

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.332
CONSEQUENCES TO COMMUNITY.

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:07.066
ALL THE OTHER ELEMENTS OF

00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:09.468
COMMUNITY AND AND BUSINESS AND

00:11:09.535 --> 00:11:10.870
THE LIKE ALL OF THIS IS

00:11:10.936 --> 00:11:13.005
IMPORTANT I'M JUST SEEING HERE

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:14.173
AND SAY AND THIS IS A VERY

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.109
CREATIVE WAY WITHOUT TAKING CASH

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:19.378
OUT OF THE BUDGET. TO BE ABLE TO

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:20.479
TO I WANTED TO SECURE TIES THIS

00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:22.381
ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS OUT IN

00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:23.616
THE STREET IMMEDIATELY.

00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:24.950
THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT THAT

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:26.152
BUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A

00:11:26.218 --> 00:11:28.187
YEAR AND BRACING BOLD ANYBODY IN

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:29.522
NEEDS IT PRIORITIZE AREAS WITH

00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:30.990
HIS ROUTE WITH US ISSUES

00:11:31.057 --> 00:11:32.058
INVOLVING.

00:11:32.124 --> 00:11:34.126
OUR HIGHEST LEVEL OF RISK THIS

00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:35.728
IS CREATIVITY IT'S BEST.

00:11:35.795 --> 00:11:37.163
IT'S A WAY TO USE FINANCING AT A

00:11:37.229 --> 00:11:38.564
DIFFERENT LEVEL.

00:11:38.631 --> 00:11:40.299
I'M TELLING YOU AS AS SO I AM

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:41.500
NOT LOOKING TO PUT ANYBODY IN

00:11:41.567 --> 00:11:42.968
HARM'S WAY WITH RESPECT TO THIS

00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:44.637
TAX ISSUE I THINK THAT IT WASN'T

00:11:44.703 --> 00:11:45.871
ANALYZED IN A PROPER WAY.

00:11:45.938 --> 00:11:47.873
I'M GONNA PUT EVERY BELL AND

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.474
WHISTLE ON THERE TO MAKE SURE

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:49.575
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN I THINK

00:11:49.642 --> 00:11:50.943
YOU'RE GONNA HEAR LEE HAD VERY

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.178
PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH

00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:53.079
THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY BECAUSE

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:54.346
THEY RAISE A VERY IMPORTANT

00:11:54.413 --> 00:11:54.780
ISSUES.

00:11:54.847 --> 00:11:57.583
THAT WE AGREE TO NOBODY'S TRYING

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.519
TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN FIGURE

00:12:00.586 --> 00:12:02.288
OUT A WAY.

00:12:02.354 --> 00:12:02.755
TO NOT.

00:12:02.822 --> 00:12:03.489
ONLY PEOPLE OUT OF MIGHT BE

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.191
UPSET THE PEOPLE THAT A HUNDRED

TWENTY INSURANCE CARRIERS FOR

DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AS HOW

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.530
WE BEING CREATIVE WHEN IT COMES

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:45.264
TO USING.

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:47.399
CURRENT MARKET MARKET MECHANISMS

00:12:47.466 --> 00:12:49.401
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MAJOR

00:12:49.468 --> 00:12:50.836
ISSUES THAT WE ARE GOING TO

00:12:50.903 --> 00:12:53.005
EVENTUALLY FACE -- THAT ARE

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:54.340
HAVING TO DEAL WITH KEPT

00:12:54.406 --> 00:12:55.875
CATASTROPHES AND JUST TO REMIND.

00:12:55.941 --> 00:12:57.910
OUR COMMITTEE HERE IS THE REASON

00:12:57.977 --> 00:12:58.978
WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE

00:12:59.044 --> 00:13:00.846
SITUATION WAS BECAUSE AFTER THE

00:13:00.913 --> 00:13:03.048
NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE WE THEN

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:04.583
MOVED TO HEAVILY REGULATE.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.352
THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WHEN I

00:13:06.418 --> 00:13:07.753
CAME TO THE PRODUCTS THEY WERE

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:08.888
SELLING WHEN THEY CAME TO

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:10.756
EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE AND WHAT WE

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:11.857
HAVE NOW IS.

00:13:11.924 --> 00:13:13.826
A MARKET THAT HAS LARGELY

00:13:13.893 --> 00:13:15.661
ABANDONED CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE

00:13:15.728 --> 00:13:17.730
FACT THAT IT WAS JUST NOT VIABLE

00:13:17.796 --> 00:13:19.431
TO DO THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT IN

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:20.699
CALIFORNIA.

00:13:20.766 --> 00:13:22.268
IT LEADS US.

00:13:22.334 --> 00:13:24.236
TO BE CREATIVE AND HOW WE NOW

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:26.672
APPROACH THE SITUATION WHICH IS

00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:28.574
DIRE WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT IS

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.609
GOING TO HAPPEN THE NEXT TIME WE

00:13:30.676 --> 00:13:32.011
HAVE A MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE.

00:13:32.077 --> 00:13:33.145
PRETTY MUCH AS WHICH THAT NOW

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:34.580
PEOPLE GONNA BE LEFT TO THEIR

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:35.681
OWN DEVICES.

00:13:35.748 --> 00:13:37.416
NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVE THE

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:39.418
PRODUCTS TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.086
THEM FULLY BE PROTECTED WHEN IT

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:42.521
COMES.

00:13:42.588 --> 00:13:43.989
TO PROTECTING YOUR HOME AFTER AN

00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:44.690
EARTHQUAKE AND THAT'S JUST THE

00:13:44.757 --> 00:13:46.825
REALITY SO THIS IS ONE ATTEMPT

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:48.360
TO TRY TO GET US TO MODERNIZE AN

00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:49.595
EXISTING PROGRAM.

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:51.630
THAT WE FEEL IS IMPORTANT AND

00:13:51.697 --> 00:13:52.998
AGAIN AS SENATOR HERTZBERG

00:13:53.065 --> 00:13:54.867
MENTIONED WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:13:54.934 --> 00:13:57.503
WE USE DATA -- AND SCIENCE TO

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.371
BACK UP WITH A HOMES THAT WOULD

00:13:59.438 --> 00:14:00.806
BE PRIORITIZE IN THIS OF THE

00:14:00.873 --> 00:14:02.241
NEED A CERTAIN TIME OF WHEN THEY

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:03.142
WERE BUILT.

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:05.511
IF THEY'RE CLOSER TO OF

00:14:05.578 --> 00:14:06.645
EARTHQUAKE FAULT -- THOSE ARE

00:14:06.712 --> 00:14:08.147
THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE

00:14:08.214 --> 00:14:09.815
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IMMEDIATELY

00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:10.649
BECAUSE WE KNOW THOSE ARE THE

00:14:10.716 --> 00:14:12.618
FOLKS THAT ARE MORE AT RISK.

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:14.920
AND AS WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW

00:14:14.987 --> 00:14:18.290
TO WE IN BE CREATIVE AND EMBRACE

00:14:18.357 --> 00:14:19.725
IS DUE TO THESE NEW PROGRAMS WE

TO BE ABLE TO BE MORE CREATIVE

00:14:26.465 --> 00:14:28.100
WHAT THE RESOURCES WE CURRENTLY

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:32.738
HAVE.

00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:34.506

00:14:51.123 --> 00:14:52.391
DISCUSSIONS IF THE BILL SHOULD

00:14:52.458 --> 00:14:53.892

HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET TO A

00:15:44.209 --> 00:15:45.210
STANDSTILL.

00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:46.712
THE CALIFORNIA COULD BUY OR SELL

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.747
A HOME BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET

00:15:48.814 --> 00:15:49.815

FLEXIBLE POLICIES WE SURE MORE

00:16:08.867 --> 00:16:10.069
THAN A MILLION HOMES.

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:11.370
AND OUR EARTHQUAKE BRACE SYMBOL

00:16:11.437 --> 00:16:13.138
PROGRAM PROVIDES THREE THOUSAND

00:16:13.205 --> 00:16:14.440
DOLLARS TO ABOUT TWO THOUSAND

00:16:14.506 --> 00:16:17.076
CALIFORNIANS EACH YEAR TO HELP

00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:18.410
THEM RETROFIT THEIR HOME.

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:19.478
THESE RETROFITS BY THE WAY COST

00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:20.713
ABOUT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED

00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:21.714
DOLLARS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.649
AND ON AVERAGE ABOUT FIFTY FIVE

00:16:23.716 --> 00:16:25.684
HUNDRED IN THE NORTH.

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:26.785
ALL CALIFORNIANS ALL

00:16:26.852 --> 00:16:28.654
CALIFORNIANS WITH A QUALIFYING

00:16:28.721 --> 00:16:30.389
HOMES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A GRANTS

00:16:30.456 --> 00:16:32.358
NOT JUST SEE POLICY HOLDERS OF

00:16:32.424 --> 00:16:33.692
THE SEVENTY EIGHT HUNDRED BETTER

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:35.361
FITS THAT WE HAVE FUNDED SO FAR.

00:16:35.427 --> 00:16:37.196
ALMOST SIX THOUSAND WERE FOR

00:16:37.262 --> 00:16:38.964
HOMES THAT ARE NOT INSURED WITH

00:16:39.031 --> 00:16:40.733
CA.

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:42.034
BUT THERE ARE OVER ONE MILLION

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:43.068
HOMES THAT NEED THIS BASIC

00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:44.703
RETROFIT AND MILLIONS OF OTHER

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.805
TYPES OF RESIDENTIAL HOMES -- IT

00:16:46.872 --> 00:16:48.140
WE HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO

00:16:48.207 --> 00:16:49.641
ADDRESS DUE TO LIMITED FUNDING.

00:16:49.708 --> 00:16:50.809
SENATOR HERTZBERG BILL WOULD

00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:52.811
EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE THE

00:16:52.878 --> 00:16:54.880
NUMBER RICH OFFENSE CA COULD

00:16:54.947 --> 00:16:55.514
FIND EVERY YEAR.

00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:56.281
HOW?

00:16:56.348 --> 00:16:58.150
BY LETTING US REDUCE HOW MUCH WE

00:16:58.217 --> 00:16:59.585
SPEND ON REINSURANCE.

00:16:59.651 --> 00:17:00.786
SO THAT THAT MONEY COULD BE

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:03.455
SPENT INSTEAD ON RETROFITTING

00:17:03.522 --> 00:17:04.590
HOMES.

00:17:04.656 --> 00:17:05.457
SAYS WE WERE FOR WE HAVE SPENT

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:07.192
ABOUT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ON

00:17:07.259 --> 00:17:09.161
REINSURANCE WHILE RECEIVING BACK.

00:17:09.228 --> 00:17:11.196
TOTAL TO A FIFTY THOUSAND

00:17:11.263 --> 00:17:12.598
DOLLARS IN CLAIMS PAID.

00:17:12.664 --> 00:17:14.099
WITH THIS BILL WE WOULD SAY

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:15.467
BETWEEN SEVENTEEN HUNDRED

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:16.468
MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR AND

00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:18.003
THAT AMOUNT WOULD BE DIRECTED

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:20.873
DIRECTLY. TO RETROFITTING HOMES

00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:22.674
IN HIGH SEISMIC AREAS.

00:17:22.741 --> 00:17:24.176
AT THE SAFETY NET FOR THE CA

00:17:24.243 --> 00:17:25.344
WOULD BE SET UP.

00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:27.279
IF WE HAVE A MASSIVE HISTORIC

00:17:27.346 --> 00:17:29.314
EARTHQUAKE ONE TWICE AS DAMAGING

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:31.049
AS NORTHRIDGE FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:17:31.116 --> 00:17:32.851
SEABOARD COULD AUTHORIZE A SMALL

00:17:32.918 --> 00:17:33.552
ASSESSMENT.

00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:35.888
ABOUT 1% ON CERTAIN TYPES OF

00:17:35.954 --> 00:17:37.356
INSURANCE POLICIES IN HIGH

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:39.825
SEISMIC AREAS THE PROBABILITY.

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:41.794
OF A 1% ASSESSMENT IS EXTREMELY

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:46.532
SMALL. ONE THIRD OF 1%.

00:17:46.598 --> 00:17:48.367
IT WOULD TAKE A HISTORIC MEGA

00:17:48.434 --> 00:17:49.601
EARTHQUAKE TO TRIGGER THE

00:17:49.668 --> 00:17:51.570
MAXIMUM 5% ASSESSMENT AND THE

00:17:51.637 --> 00:17:53.005
PROBABILITY OF THAT IS ALMOST

00:17:53.071 --> 00:17:53.906
ZERO LITERALLY.

00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:57.543
LESS THAN ONE FIFTH OF 1%.

00:17:57.609 --> 00:17:59.111
ANY ASSESSMENT HOWEVER UNLIKELY

00:17:59.178 --> 00:18:00.612
WOULD ONLY A TEST POLICIES IN

00:18:00.679 --> 00:18:01.914
HIGH SEISMIC AREAS.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.582
HAVE THE COUNTIES IN A IN THIS

00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:04.883
EARTHQUAKE PRONE STATE.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.218
AND THOSE HIGH SEISMIC AREAS ARE

00:18:06.285 --> 00:18:08.320
EXACTLY WHERE SAVINGS AND

00:18:08.387 --> 00:18:09.788
REINSURANCE WILL BE INVESTED. TO

00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:11.256
THE BILL COMMUNITIES ARE MORE

00:18:11.323 --> 00:18:12.858
RESILIENT TO A CATASTROPHIC

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:14.259
EARTHQUAKE.

00:18:14.326 --> 00:18:15.327
SO.

00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:16.295
WHAT DO YOU CALL A POTENTIAL

00:18:16.361 --> 00:18:18.497
ASSESSMENT THAT IS ALMOST

00:18:18.564 --> 00:18:20.065
CERTAINLY NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN?

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:22.501
A NINETY NINE POINT 7%

00:18:22.568 --> 00:18:24.269
PROBABILITY THAT NO ONE WILL

00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:27.539
EVER PAY EVEN A 1% ASSESSMENT.

00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:28.574
IS THAT A TAX.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.442
SOME SAY IT IS.

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:32.744
BUT IF YOU CONSIDER THAT JUST

00:18:32.811 --> 00:18:34.480
THE EXISTENCE OF THAT POTENTIAL

00:31:53.044 --> 00:31:53.878
GOING TO BE AN ASSESSMENT.

00:31:53.945 --> 00:31:55.446
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AFTER ALL

00:31:55.513 --> 00:31:57.015
THESE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE

00:31:57.081 --> 00:31:58.616
BEEN SPENT IT'S QUICK AS TO BE

00:31:58.683 --> 00:31:59.617
SO BIG.

00:31:59.684 --> 00:32:01.119
YOU KNOW I MEAN IN TERMS OF HOW

00:32:01.185 --> 00:32:02.186
IT WORKS SO IT'S REALLY A LEGAL

00:32:02.253 --> 00:32:04.222
FICTION WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:06.024
CONFUSE FINANCIAL MECHANISM TO

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:10.094
BE ABLE TO CREATE CASH. TO TO TO

00:32:10.161 --> 00:32:11.095
BE ABLE TO DO AS MUCH GRAYSON

00:32:11.162 --> 00:32:13.064
VOLTRON THE STATE OF POSSIBLE IN

00:32:13.131 --> 00:32:15.333
THIS RACE WE HAVE BETWEEN NOW

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.501
WHEN AN EARTHQUAKE.

00:32:16.567 --> 00:32:21.039
SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE

00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:22.774
SO WE'RE USING THE THE THE VALUE

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.209
OF THE REINSURANCE FUND TO

00:32:25.276 --> 00:32:27.111
INVEST HEAVILY INTO THE BRACE

00:32:27.178 --> 00:32:29.881
AND AND BOLD -- WE USING ABOUT

00:32:29.947 --> 00:32:32.317
LESS THAN A THIRD OF IT OKAY.

00:32:32.383 --> 00:32:33.785
WE'RE STILL HAVING REINSURANCE

00:32:33.851 --> 00:32:34.952
TO BE ABLE TO CREATE THE

00:32:35.019 --> 00:32:37.021
FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE

00:32:37.088 --> 00:32:38.222
SEVENTEEN STACK TO SEVENTEEN

00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:40.124
POINT SIX WE'RE JUST REDUCING

00:32:40.191 --> 00:32:41.492
THAT NUMBER AND THEN WE'RE

00:32:41.559 --> 00:32:43.428
PUTTING AT THE TOP SO WE GET TO

00:32:43.494 --> 00:32:45.029
SEVENTEEN POINT. SIX FOR A ONE

00:32:45.096 --> 00:32:45.897
IN FOUR HUNDRED YEAR EVENT

00:32:45.963 --> 00:32:47.765
HORIZON TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE

00:32:47.832 --> 00:32:50.134
WE HAVE THE RATING AGENCIE.

00:32:50.201 --> 00:32:51.869
APPROVAL TO BE ABLE TO BORROW AT

00:32:51.936 --> 00:32:53.304
THAT TRIPLE A RATE.

00:32:53.371 --> 00:32:55.573
SO FOR CONVENIENCE AND I'M NOT

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.941
ADVOCATING THIS BUT FOR

00:32:57.008 --> 00:32:58.176
CONVENIENCE.

00:32:58.242 --> 00:32:59.877
WE HAVE NON PARTICIPATING

00:32:59.944 --> 00:33:03.414
ENTITIES BEING DRAWN INTO THIS --

00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:05.116
CORRECT CORRECT ON BOTH BY THE

00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:05.983
WAY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE TRADE

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.852
WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IS THAT NON

00:33:07.919 --> 00:33:10.788
PARTICIPATING ENTITIES RIGHT.

00:33:10.855 --> 00:33:12.357
THEY'RE NOT PARTICIPATING BUT

00:33:12.423 --> 00:33:14.525
WHAT WHAT I BELIEVE CITED ON THE

00:33:14.592 --> 00:33:16.561
REASON WITH WITH THE SO A A

00:33:16.627 --> 00:33:18.496
COMMISSIONER LARA AND TREASURE A

00:33:18.563 --> 00:33:19.197
MARK.

00:33:19.263 --> 00:33:20.598
I TOOK THIS BILL ON IS BECAUSE

00:33:20.665 --> 00:33:22.400
WHAT'S DIFFERENT HERE THEY'RE

00:33:22.467 --> 00:33:23.801
TALKING ABOUT IS STACK WILL

00:33:23.868 --> 00:33:25.703
GUESS WHO'S AVOIDING THE STACK

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:26.504
IT'S THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE

00:33:26.571 --> 00:33:27.205
AUTHORITY.

00:33:27.271 --> 00:33:29.340
AND THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING

00:33:29.407 --> 00:33:31.042
TO ALLOW PEOPLE WHO ARE NON

00:33:31.109 --> 00:33:34.746
PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE

00:33:34.812 --> 00:33:36.047
EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE.

00:33:36.114 --> 00:33:36.848
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE SOCIETAL

00:33:36.914 --> 00:33:37.749
STANDPOINT THE MORE PEOPLE THAT

00:33:37.815 --> 00:33:39.083
ARE BRACED IN BOLD THE BETTER

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.052
CHANCE WE HAVE GOING FORWARD AS

00:33:41.119 --> 00:33:42.153
A SOCIETY.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.488
EVERYBODY GETS.

00:33:43.554 --> 00:33:44.722
ACCESS TO THE BRAZEN BOWL

00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:46.824
PROGRAM YOU CAN BE ASSURED IN

00:33:46.891 --> 00:33:48.059
THE PROGRAM YOU AN BE SURE

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:49.360
OTHER PROGRAM OR YOU COULD NOT

00:33:49.427 --> 00:33:50.495
INSURED AT ALL WHAT'S THE

00:33:50.561 --> 00:33:51.863
DIFFERENCE BY THE WAY AND I I

00:33:51.929 --> 00:33:52.764
LOVE THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:56.033
SWING YOU SWING FOR THE FENCE

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.301
HERTZBERG.

00:33:57.368 --> 00:34:02.206
GOD BLESS YOU -- WHAT WHY

00:34:02.273 --> 00:34:05.843
WOULDN'T WHY WOULDN'T IT BE?

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.645
A MANDATORY.

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:08.980
A SCENARIO FOR MANDATORY

00:34:09.046 --> 00:34:10.615
COVERAGE.

00:34:10.681 --> 00:34:11.649
SO IF WE'RE LOOKING CRITICAL

00:34:11.716 --> 00:34:13.050
ZONES THAT ARE VULNERABLE IT

00:34:13.117 --> 00:34:14.352
WHETHER THEY BE EARTHQUAKE

00:34:14.419 --> 00:34:15.620
WHETHER THEY BE FIRE.

00:34:15.686 --> 00:34:18.222
THAT THERE NOT BE A MANDATORY

00:34:18.289 --> 00:34:21.359
COVERAGE. FOR ALL THOSE THAT --

00:34:21.426 --> 00:34:25.096
PURCHASE OR OWN -- PROPERTIES IN

00:34:25.163 --> 00:34:27.231
THOSE AREAS DOES THAT NOT ALONE

00:34:27.298 --> 00:34:28.733
IF YOU HAD A MANDATORY SYSTEM

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.134
WITH THAT NOT ALLOW FOR THAT

00:34:30.201 --> 00:34:31.803
REINSURANCE BOTHERED THAT THE

00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:33.471
THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE FOUR

00:34:33.538 --> 00:34:34.672
CORNERS OF THE DEAL THAT WAS

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:36.674
EXPRESSED THAT HAPPENED TWENTY

00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:37.942
FIVE YEARS AGO.

00:34:38.009 --> 00:34:39.710
WAS THE IDEA THAT HOMEOWNERS

00:34:39.777 --> 00:34:40.912
INSURANCE MARKETS WERE JUST

00:34:40.978 --> 00:34:42.213
BLOWN UP OKAY.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.382
AND SO WE CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:45.316
OF THE EARTH REGULATORY AND YOU

00:34:45.383 --> 00:34:46.617
COULD BE A PARTICIPATING OR NON

00:34:46.684 --> 00:34:47.752
PARTICIPATING.

00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:49.053
IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.121
WANT TO BUY THE INSURANCE I FEEL

00:34:50.188 --> 00:34:51.489
A BUSINESS QUITE FRANKLY LOTS OF

00:34:51.556 --> 00:34:53.658
BUSINESSES YOUR LENDERS REQUIRE

00:34:53.724 --> 00:34:54.358
YOU TO BUY.

00:34:54.425 --> 00:34:55.927
RIGHT BUT IF I'M SOMEBODY

00:34:55.993 --> 00:34:57.862
THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT EXCEPT

00:34:57.929 --> 00:34:59.130
FOR MAYBE DRIVING YOU'D HAVE

00:34:59.197 --> 00:35:00.932
INSURANCE TO DRIVE RIGHT THAT

00:35:00.998 --> 00:35:01.899
YOU HAVE INSURANCE ON YOUR

00:35:01.966 --> 00:35:03.267
BUILDING IS YOUR ASSET YOU COULD

00:35:03.334 --> 00:35:04.335
DO WHAT YOU WANT WITH IT.

00:35:04.402 --> 00:35:06.604
UNLESS THERE'S A LENDER OR AGAIN

00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:07.338
JUST LIKE WITH RESPECT TO

00:35:07.405 --> 00:35:09.073
DRIVING IS A PUBLIC POLICY

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.175
REASON WHY YOU HAVE INSURANCE SO

00:35:11.242 --> 00:35:12.610
I SUSPECT THAT.

00:35:12.677 --> 00:35:13.444
THE SAME PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:35:13.511 --> 00:35:14.779
OPPOSING THIS NOW I DON'T KNOW

00:35:14.846 --> 00:35:16.447
OTHER PUT NEW PEOPLE OPPOSE IT

00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:17.315
BECAUSE IF YOU ONLY AND THEY

00:35:17.381 --> 00:35:18.349
THAT SHARON'S.

00:35:18.416 --> 00:35:19.750
YEAH AND WE WE HAD THIS TO

00:35:19.817 --> 00:35:21.319
DISCUSSION THANK YOU WE HAVE

00:35:21.385 --> 00:35:22.753
THIS DISCUSSION WITH HEALTHCARE.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.155
EVERYTHING WHEN IT COMES TO

00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:26.290
SOCIETAL COVERAGE IS BASED ON

00:35:26.357 --> 00:35:28.192
VOLUME AND WHAT YOU'RE ACHIEVING

00:35:28.259 --> 00:35:30.962
IS VOLUME. FOR THOSE THAT ARE

00:35:31.028 --> 00:35:33.030
NOT EVEN IT NECESSARILY --

00:35:33.097 --> 00:35:34.532
DISSIPATING I'M WONDERING IF THE

00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:35.900
VOLUME OF MANDATING

00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:37.735
PARTICIPATION WHICH SHE THE SAME

00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:41.906
END WHILE STILL ALLOWING -- THAT --

00:35:41.973 --> 00:35:47.879
NUTS AND BOLTS ARE GRAYSON BLAKE

00:35:47.945 --> 00:35:49.313
SYMBOL [inaudible]

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:53.050
GRAHAM -- TO TO TO MOVE FORWARD.

00:35:53.117 --> 00:35:54.218
GIVE ANY THOUGHT I I DON'T I

00:35:54.285 --> 00:35:55.286
MEAN I IT'S A GIGANTIC LEE

00:35:55.353 --> 00:35:55.853
DIFFERENT ISSUE.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:56.754
THAT SWING IN FOR THE THE

00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:58.055
STRATOSPHERE BECAUSE IF YOU'RE

00:35:58.122 --> 00:35:59.957
NOW IT RAISES SO MANY LEGAL AND

00:36:00.024 --> 00:36:01.459
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES TO MANDATE

00:36:01.526 --> 00:36:03.794
SOMEBODY TO HAVE EARTHQUAKE

00:36:03.861 --> 00:36:05.596
INSURANCE ON THEIR PROPERTY.

00:36:05.663 --> 00:36:06.831
INVITE ICAL ZONES.

00:36:06.898 --> 00:36:07.932
WELL YOU COULD ARGUE FOREVER

00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:09.333
REASONS CRITICAL ZONES OR

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.434
WHATEVER CRITICAL ZONES I

00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:11.736
USUALLY RAISE A WHOLE HOST OF

00:36:11.802 --> 00:36:13.471
OTHER ISSUES WE'RE TRYING TO DO.

00:36:13.538 --> 00:36:14.605
IN THE SCHEME OF SWING FOR THE

00:36:14.672 --> 00:36:16.774
FENCES THE CLOSE FENCES AND JUST

00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:18.543
BEING CREATIVE FINANCIALLY TO BE

00:36:18.609 --> 00:36:21.412
ABLE TO IN THE AREA WHERE THE

00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:23.381
RISK IS NOT GONE OF COURSE I

00:36:23.447 --> 00:36:24.448
WE'VE ALL LIVED THROUGH THE

00:36:24.515 --> 00:36:25.983
PERFECT STORM AROUND HERE.

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:28.119
BUT IT'S A REMOTE COST VERSUS A

00:36:28.185 --> 00:36:30.154
DIRECT IMMEDIATE BENEFIT OF AN

00:36:30.221 --> 00:36:32.723
IMPENDING PROBLEM WATER WE DO.

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.492
I CERTAIN SITTING IN THIS JOB

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:36.427
AND SAYING YOU KNOW I WANT TO

00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:37.695
EVERYTHING I CAN'T IT'S HARD

00:36:37.762 --> 00:36:39.163
BECAUSE NO CONSTITUENCY FOR THE

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:40.932
FUTURE UNTIL IT BLOWS UP AND

00:36:40.998 --> 00:36:42.500
EVERYBODY RUNS AROUND SAYS OH MY

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:43.834
GOD ON FIXING THE PROBLEM.

00:36:43.901 --> 00:36:45.503
WORK THIS TO ME IS A THOUGHT FOR

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.104
THE WAY IF WE GET TWENTY YEARS

00:36:47.171 --> 00:36:48.439
OF THIS STUFF RIGHT THERE

00:36:48.506 --> 00:36:49.840
MILLION HOUSES.

00:36:49.907 --> 00:36:51.242
YOU GOT MILLION HOUSES YOU'VE

00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:52.510
SUBSTANTIALLY MITIGATED

00:36:52.577 --> 00:36:53.945
SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS SOCIETY

00:36:54.011 --> 00:37:00.184
ACROSS THE BOARD NOW YOU CAN OF

00:37:00.251 --> 00:37:00.751
EARTHQUAKE AND SEVEN MINUTES

00:37:00.818 --> 00:37:01.786
FROM NOW.

00:37:01.852 --> 00:37:02.753
IN WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON THIS

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:02.954
BILL.

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.255
RIGHT.

00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:05.456
THAT IS THE IRONIC BUT THAT

00:37:05.523 --> 00:37:05.890
WOULD NOT BE GOOD.

00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:07.224
BUT THE POINT IS YOU NEVER KNOW

00:37:07.291 --> 00:37:09.327
AND OUR JOB IS TO GET AHEAD OF

00:37:09.393 --> 00:37:10.995
THE GAME FIGURE IT OUT.

00:37:11.062 --> 00:37:12.229
I THINK WHAT THEY'VE COME UP

00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:13.531
WITH THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER

00:37:13.598 --> 00:37:14.966
THE THAT THE EARTHQUAKE

00:37:15.032 --> 00:37:16.467
AUTHORITY IS PRETTY BRILLIANT.

00:37:16.534 --> 00:37:18.102
AND I'M WILLING TO SWING FROM

00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:20.338
THE FENCES THE PUSH IT GIVEN THE

00:37:20.404 --> 00:37:21.472
CONSTRAINED ABOUT THE TAX STUFF

00:37:21.539 --> 00:37:22.873
THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.208
THINK THAT THE LEGAL OPINIONS.

00:37:24.275 --> 00:37:26.544
ARE WRONG AND IF NOT I WANT TO

00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:27.445
PUT WHAT'S CALLED A VALIDATION

00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:28.980
ACTION THAT SAYS BECAUSE I WANT

00:37:29.046 --> 00:37:30.348
TO PUT PEOPLE IN HARM'S WY

00:37:30.414 --> 00:37:31.182
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THIS WERE

00:37:31.248 --> 00:37:32.783
ABOUT HERE TAX IS A DIRECT

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:33.618
RELATIONSHIP.

00:37:33.684 --> 00:37:35.052
OF I MET EXTRACTING MONEY FROM

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:37.388
SOMEBODY FOR GOVERNMENT PURPOSES

00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:38.856
I'M EXTRACTING A HYPOTHETICAL

00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:40.858
AMOUNT OF MONEY AFTER ALL OF

00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:42.193
THESE THINGS WITH A RISK PROFILE

00:37:42.259 --> 00:37:43.561
IS SO LOW.

00:37:43.628 --> 00:37:44.662
I'M NOT SO SURE THAT'S WHAT THAT

00:37:44.729 --> 00:37:46.897
MEANS BUT I I I'M VERY SENSITIVE

00:37:46.964 --> 00:37:47.365
TO IT.

00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:50.635
AND I'M NOT GONNA RUN PEOPLE TO

00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:51.636
THE WALL OVER.

00:37:51.702 --> 00:37:52.770
ALL IN ALL IN HERE -- I WANT TO

00:37:52.837 --> 00:37:54.271
CERTAINLY STUDY THIS -- I THINK

00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:56.674
IT IS VERY INTERESTING -- I

00:37:56.741 --> 00:37:59.176
THINK THAT YOUR CONCERN ABOUT

00:37:59.243 --> 00:38:01.512
EARTHQUAKES IS WHAT I SHARE

00:38:01.579 --> 00:38:03.147
ABOUT WILDFIRES.

00:38:03.214 --> 00:38:05.316
IN THE CENTRAL IN INTERIOR OF

00:38:05.383 --> 00:38:08.152
CALIFORNIA -- THE AND SO IS WE

00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:10.087
LOOK UPON THIS WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:38:10.154 --> 00:38:10.988
THE SAME.

00:38:11.055 --> 00:38:13.858
THE THE THE SAY THE SAME ISSUE --

00:38:13.924 --> 00:38:15.126
PLEASE BY ANALOGY THE ONLY

00:38:15.192 --> 00:38:16.727
DIFFERENCE I WOULD SUGGEST IS

00:38:16.794 --> 00:38:18.029
THE ARGUMENT THAT WAS MADE IS

00:38:18.095 --> 00:38:19.463
THAT THERE'S GONNA BE PREMIUM

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:21.732
COST NEXT YEAR ON WILD FIRE

00:38:21.799 --> 00:38:22.533
INSURANCE.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.902
UNDER THIS PROPOSAL THERE IS NO

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:28.339
PREMIUM COST UNTIL A THERE'S AN

00:38:28.406 --> 00:38:29.607
EVENT.

00:38:29.674 --> 00:38:30.908
BE BECAUSE THE IDEA OF INSURANCE

00:38:30.975 --> 00:38:32.810
UP FRONT IS TO PROTECT IT BE IT

00:38:32.877 --> 00:38:34.779
HAS TO BE BIGGER THAN FIFTEEN

00:38:34.845 --> 00:38:35.613
BILLION BOX.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.815
RIGHT AND SEE IT'S CONTINGENT

00:38:37.882 --> 00:38:39.517
WHICH WHAT THAT NUMBER IS WE

00:38:39.583 --> 00:38:41.252
DON'T REALLY KNOW AND THERE'S A

00:38:41.318 --> 00:38:42.787
LOT INTERVENING FACTORS WITH

00:38:42.853 --> 00:38:44.855
THERWISE A CAR. TO ME IT'S JUST

00:38:44.922 --> 00:38:46.757
SMART FINANCIAL PLANNING AT A

00:38:46.824 --> 00:38:47.391
PLACE WHERE WE'RE NOT SPENDING

00:38:47.458 --> 00:38:50.428
CASH SAVING CASH AND USING THE

00:38:50.494 --> 00:38:52.363
SAVINGS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:54.565
ALMOST AS IF YOU ARE CREATING.

00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:58.302
A CATASTROPHE IN CASUALTY

00:38:58.369 --> 00:38:58.602
[inaudible]

00:38:58.669 --> 00:39:00.404
SUPER FUND.

00:39:00.471 --> 00:39:02.440
THAT MAYBE SHOULD NOT HOLD HEAR

00:39:02.506 --> 00:39:03.140
ME OUT.

00:39:03.207 --> 00:39:05.576
THAT SHOULD NOT THAT SHOULD NOT

00:39:05.643 --> 00:39:08.412
BE TRIGGERED BUT ONLY UPON.

00:39:08.479 --> 00:39:10.514
BAD EVENT SO YOU TALKED ABOUT

00:39:10.581 --> 00:39:12.083
THAT NEXUS.

00:39:12.149 --> 00:39:13.017
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IT DOES YES

00:39:13.084 --> 00:39:14.919
A GOOD LIST OF AND HOW EXACTLY

00:39:14.985 --> 00:39:16.754
SO I'M WONDERING IT WAS IT

00:39:16.821 --> 00:39:18.289
CONTEMPLATED BY THE AUTHOR --

00:39:18.355 --> 00:39:20.991
THAT THIS ONLY BE LIMITED.

00:39:21.058 --> 00:39:23.527
TO EARTHQUAKES I ENDED DID YOU

00:39:23.594 --> 00:39:26.030
THINK THROUGH OTHER SCENARIOS

00:39:26.097 --> 00:39:27.431
CATASTROPHIC FLOODS OF

00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:31.068
CATASTROPHIC FIRES.

00:39:31.135 --> 00:39:33.704
THAT'S THE ONE IN SUPER FUN WELL

00:39:33.771 --> 00:39:34.338
YOU KNOW EMERGENCY SUPER THING

00:39:34.405 --> 00:39:34.939
YOU COULD DO THAT I HAD THAT

00:39:35.005 --> 00:39:35.906
DISCUSSION WITH THE INSURANCE

00:39:35.973 --> 00:39:37.141
FOLKS YESTERDAY.

00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:38.676
AND YOU KNOW THERE'S THE BAND

00:39:38.743 --> 00:39:40.077
WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:39:40.144 --> 00:39:41.412
SOCIALIZE ALL COSTA BOSS THE

00:39:41.479 --> 00:39:42.313
BOARD.

00:39:42.379 --> 00:39:43.914
I THINK IT'S I THINK THAT THE

00:39:43.981 --> 00:39:45.716
EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY GIVES. TWO

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:47.651
THINGS ONE IS A VERY DIFFERENT

00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:49.120
DYNAMIC BECAUSE IT'S AN EXISTING

00:39:49.186 --> 00:39:50.721
MATURE TWENTY FIVE YOUR ENTITY

00:39:50.788 --> 00:39:52.022
WITH A LOT OF CASH IN THE BANK.

00:39:52.089 --> 00:39:54.158
AND UP THE PRE EXISTING PROGRAM

00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:55.926
TO THE PRE EXISTING PROGRAM IS

00:39:55.993 --> 00:39:57.795
TO FIND A BRACE AND BOWL THREE

00:39:57.862 --> 00:39:59.263
MITIGATION IN ALL THESE OTHER

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:00.798
FIELDS.

00:40:00.865 --> 00:40:02.133
YOU YOU START DEFINING WHAT THAT

00:40:02.199 --> 00:40:03.901
MEANS IN FIRE AND CUTTING DOWN

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:05.436
THIS AND DOING THAT WHAT'S

00:40:05.503 --> 00:40:06.804
COVERED AND WHAT'S NOT COVERED.

00:40:06.871 --> 00:40:08.639
YOU OF TEN THOUSAND COVERAGE

00:40:08.706 --> 00:40:10.341
LAWYERS TRYING T FIGURE IT OUT.

00:40:10.407 --> 00:40:11.575
AND SO THE CONSEQUENCES IT

00:40:11.642 --> 00:40:13.110
DOESN'T REALLY COMPARE APPLES TO

00:40:13.177 --> 00:40:15.246
APPLES TO ME IT'S A IT'S A IT'S

00:40:15.312 --> 00:40:16.814
A IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A CURVE

00:40:16.881 --> 00:40:17.414
BALL.

00:40:17.481 --> 00:40:18.549
IT DOESN'T REALLY DIRECT WHAT

00:40:18.616 --> 00:40:20.084
WENT ON THIS SITUATION YOU HAVE

00:40:20.151 --> 00:40:22.386
A VERY DIRECT DYNAMIC IN THE

00:40:22.453 --> 00:40:24.622
EXISTING MATURE ORGANIZATION.

00:40:24.688 --> 00:40:25.923
EVIDENCE IS A WILLINGNESS TO

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.658
EXTEND IT TO OTHERS IN A VERY

00:40:27.725 --> 00:40:28.659
DIRECT.

00:40:28.726 --> 00:40:30.895
LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IF WE

00:40:30.961 --> 00:40:32.263
COULD CREATE A LARGER POOL IN

00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:33.931
THAT REGARD IT'S ULTIMATELY

00:40:33.998 --> 00:40:35.032
GOING TO HAPPEN BUT I DO THINK

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:35.633
THAT.

00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:37.701
WHETHER IT'S FIRES OR MUDSLIDES

00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:39.370
OR ALL THESE OTHER DYNAMICS.

00:40:39.436 --> 00:40:41.472
THOSE THINGS YOU CAN'T FIGURE

00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:43.674
OUT A SHORT WINDOW THIS TO ME

00:40:43.741 --> 00:40:45.109
YOU CAN START THIS PROCESS AND

00:40:45.176 --> 00:40:46.777
IN TWO YEARS NOW IF YOU DIDN'T

00:40:46.844 --> 00:40:47.978
LIKE IT YOU COULD SHUT OFF AND

00:40:48.045 --> 00:40:49.280
THEY GO NOT A BIG DEAL AND

00:40:49.346 --> 00:40:50.881
THERE'S NEVER ANY RISK.

00:40:50.948 --> 00:40:53.350
YOU CAN PUT A COUPON AT EIGHT

00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:54.885
SOME KIND OF LIMITATION ON IT I

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:56.220
THINK I JUST WANT TO TRY TO GET

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:56.954
AS MANY HOUSES BOLTED AS

00:40:57.021 --> 00:40:57.721
POSSIBLE.

00:40:57.788 --> 00:41:04.662
WITH CREATIVE FINANCING AND

00:41:04.728 --> 00:41:05.229
THEY'RE WILLING TO DO IT AND

00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:06.330
THEY'RE SMART ABOUT IT.

00:41:06.397 --> 00:41:07.965
IT DOESN'T WORK YOU KNOW IT

00:41:08.032 --> 00:41:09.266
DOESN'T WORK BETTER I SHOULD ON

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:10.134
THE ROOMS AND IT'S GREAT.

00:41:10.201 --> 00:41:10.734
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU

00:41:10.801 --> 00:41:11.669
VERY MUCH I LOOK FORTY TWO

00:41:11.735 --> 00:41:12.269
DIVING AND THIS IS I FIND VERY

00:41:12.336 --> 00:41:12.903
INTERESTING VERY INTERESTING IN

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:14.205
THIS CREATIVE.

00:41:14.271 --> 00:41:16.707
THANK YOU OUR SENATOR GALGIANI --

00:41:16.774 --> 00:41:18.642
FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR --

00:41:18.709 --> 00:41:20.077
THIS IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:21.278
ISSUE AND I WAS IN SOUTHERN

00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:22.513
CALIFORNIA WHEN.

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.981
THE EARTHQUAKE OCCURRED YES I

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:26.550
WAS SIGNED SYMPATHETIC TO IT --

00:41:26.617 --> 00:41:28.185
BUT I APPROACH THIS WITH SOME

00:41:28.252 --> 00:41:30.654
SKEPTICISM AND I I WANTED TO

00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:32.590
SHOW YOU THE LENS THAT THAT I'M

00:41:32.656 --> 00:41:33.624
LOOKING AT THIS BILL FROM.

00:41:33.691 --> 00:41:36.293
NOW ON MY DISTRICT WE HAVE

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.628
SEVENTEEN HUNDRED MILES OF LEVEE

00:41:37.695 --> 00:41:39.330
AND SELL HOMEOWNERS AND

00:41:39.396 --> 00:41:40.431
SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN

00:41:40.497 --> 00:41:42.499
COUNTIES HAVE TO BUY FLOOD

00:41:42.566 --> 00:41:43.968
INSURANCE BECAUSE WE'RE AT RISK.

00:41:44.034 --> 00:41:45.903
IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WE

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:47.771
SUFFERED A CATASTROPHIC FLOOD

00:41:47.838 --> 00:41:49.440
AND MANY INDIVIDUALS LOST THEIR

00:41:49.506 --> 00:41:50.808
HOMES THERE WERE MILLIONS AND

00:41:50.875 --> 00:41:52.076
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CROP

00:41:52.142 --> 00:41:53.043
DAMAGE.

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:55.079
SINCE THAT TIME THERE BEEN MORE

00:41:55.145 --> 00:41:56.947
HOMES BUILT AND THE FOR THE AREA

00:41:57.014 --> 00:41:59.149
THAT WAS FLOODED IN.

00:41:59.216 --> 00:41:59.783
NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN BUT WHAT

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:04.288
THE LEGISLATURE DID THERE ARE A

00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:05.522
COUPLE THINGS THAT HAPPENED.

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:06.657
ONE THE FEDS HAVE SENSE REQUIRED

00:42:06.724 --> 00:42:07.658
THAT HOMEOWNERS AN THESE FLOOD

00:42:07.725 --> 00:42:11.328
ZONES ARE REQUIRED REQUIRED TO

00:42:11.395 --> 00:42:12.796
PURCHASE FLOOD INSURANCE.

00:42:12.863 --> 00:42:14.932
AND THEY CANNOT PURCHASE A HOME

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:17.134
UNLESS THEY HAVE IT -- MINE COST

00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:18.736
ME CLOSE TO FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS

00:42:18.802 --> 00:42:20.871
A YEAR IT'S NOT TOO MUCH BUT I I

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:22.806
PAY AS A THAT'S BECAUSE THE BANK

00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:24.208
RECORDS CENTER.

00:42:24.275 --> 00:42:25.776
DO YOU WANT TO BUY WITHOUT FLOOD

00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:27.978
INSURANCE IF YOU PAY CASH YOU

00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:28.445
WOULD HAVE TO BUY IT.

00:42:28.512 --> 00:42:29.980
BUT I KNOW I LIVE IN A FLOOD

00:42:30.047 --> 00:42:31.882
ZONE SO I WANT TO PROTECT MYSELF.

00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:33.817
ALSO WANT TO PROTECT MYSELF --

00:42:33.884 --> 00:42:34.418
THE SECOND THING THAT HAPPENED

00:42:34.485 --> 00:42:35.753
WAS THAT.

00:42:35.819 --> 00:42:37.388
PASSED THE SENATE BILL FIVE IN

00:42:37.454 --> 00:42:39.623
EITHER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN OR TWO

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:40.524
THOUSAND EIGHT AND IT SAID THAT

00:42:40.591 --> 00:42:42.259
OKAY WE RECOGNIZE THAT IN

00:42:42.326 --> 00:42:44.228
CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE THERE.

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:46.830
THEY ARE FLOOD ZONES AND IF

00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:48.799
BUILDERS WANT TO CONTINUE TO

00:42:48.866 --> 00:42:50.301
BUILD IN THOSE FLOOD ZONES.

00:42:50.367 --> 00:42:52.136
AND CITY GOVERNMENTS COUNTY

00:42:52.202 --> 00:42:53.938
GOVERNMENTS WANT TO CONTINUE TO

00:42:54.004 --> 00:42:55.506
PROVE DEVELOPMENT IN THESE HIGH

00:42:55.572 --> 00:42:57.508
RISK AREAS THEN THERE NEEDS TO

00:42:57.574 --> 00:43:00.210
BE A A TIME LINE.

00:43:00.277 --> 00:43:02.046
AND THEIR LEAD NEEDS TO BE --

00:43:02.112 --> 00:43:04.281
REQUIRE A STEP PROCESS WHERE THE

00:43:04.348 --> 00:43:05.416
BUILDERS IN THE LOCAL

00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:06.517
GOVERNMENTS COME UP WITH THE

00:43:06.583 --> 00:43:08.786
PROCESS BY WHICH THEY CAN ENSURE

00:43:08.852 --> 00:43:10.254
THAT ANY NEW CONSTRUCTION.

00:43:10.321 --> 00:43:11.855
WOULD NOT BE PLACING NEW

00:43:11.922 --> 00:43:13.123
HOMEOWNERS.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.225
AT GREAT RISK SO IN OTHER WORDS

00:43:15.292 --> 00:43:16.627
THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A PLAN TO

00:43:16.694 --> 00:43:18.462
MAKE SURE THAT ANY OF THE NEW

00:43:18.529 --> 00:43:20.164
HOMES AND A HIGH RISK AREA.

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:22.766
WOULD HAVE TO BE -- BUILT IN

00:43:22.833 --> 00:43:24.535
SUCH A WAY THAT THEY WOULD

00:43:24.601 --> 00:43:28.205
ABSOLUTELY NOT BE AT RISK SO --

00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:31.108
WHAT I'M I'M LOOKING FOR IN THIS

00:43:31.175 --> 00:43:32.643
I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BUT THAT'S

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.712
MY MINDSET AND I'M WONDERING?

00:43:34.778 --> 00:43:36.747
THAT YOU KNOW WHILE THERE'S THIS

00:43:36.814 --> 00:43:38.849
ASSESSMENT THAT SEEMS SEEMS KIND

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:40.751
OF OPEN ENDED MAYBE IT'S IS IT

00:43:40.818 --> 00:43:43.520
TEN YEARS IT WOULD GO AWAY.

00:43:43.587 --> 00:43:45.122
ASSESSMENT AFTER THERE WAS A

00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:47.391
GIGANTIC EARTHQUAKE IT WOULD BE

00:43:47.458 --> 00:43:49.426
THE LAST PART OF MONEY TOUCH.

00:43:49.493 --> 00:43:51.962
IF IT GOT HIT AND THEN IT WOULD

00:43:52.029 --> 00:43:53.731
LAST OKAY UP TO TEN OKAY SO SO

00:43:53.797 --> 00:43:54.932
I'M JUST I'M WONDERING IF

00:43:54.999 --> 00:43:57.634
THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE BILL.

00:43:57.701 --> 00:44:00.604
THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT.

00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:03.207
GOING FORWARD WE WOULDN'T BE

00:44:03.273 --> 00:44:08.112
DOING THE KINDS OF CONSTRUCTION

00:44:08.178 --> 00:44:09.613
AND THAT WOULD.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:10.914
PLACE HOMEOWNERS AT SUCH A RISK

00:44:10.981 --> 00:44:12.416
IF THERE WERE AN EVENT IN OTHER

00:44:12.483 --> 00:44:13.317
WORDS THE THE YOU SHOW ME

00:44:13.384 --> 00:44:15.786
PICTURES OF THE STRUCTURES THAT

00:44:15.853 --> 00:44:17.321
REQUIRE THE BRAZEN BOLT.

00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:18.622
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WOULD

00:44:18.689 --> 00:44:20.591
PROHIBIT THAT KIND OF

00:44:20.657 --> 00:44:22.226
CONSTRUCTION GOING FORWARD WHEN

00:44:22.292 --> 00:44:24.261
WE KNOW THAT UNLESS WE PUT MORE

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:25.529
MONEY TOWARD IT WE'RE GONNA JUST

00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:28.399

AN EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE.

00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:16.286

IS CONTINUED ASSESSMENT GOES TO

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:28.699
THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF CA

I MEAN THAT'S THE LEGAL KIND OF

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:00.897
THEORY WHAT'S BEING DONE HERE IS

00:50:00.964 --> 00:50:02.866
TO SAY THAT CONTAGION ASSESSMENT

00:50:02.933 --> 00:50:04.434
WHICH WILL NEVER.

00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:06.737
TAKE A FACT GIVES US THE ABILITY

00:50:06.803 --> 00:50:09.206
TO NOT BY AGE REINSURANCE OTHER

00:50:09.272 --> 00:50:12.142
YEAH BECAUSE THERE'S IF WE HAVE

00:50:12.209 --> 00:50:12.743
A CONTINGENT OF SAYS MATT THAN

00:50:12.809 --> 00:50:13.443
THAT.

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:14.811
GOES IN THE PLACE OF REINSURANCE

00:50:14.878 --> 00:50:16.747
AND THEN THEY'LL TAKE THAT MONEY

00:50:16.813 --> 00:50:18.382
AND PUT IT INTO A BRACE INVOLVED.

00:50:18.448 --> 00:50:20.283
AS AS WE SAID BEFORE WE DON'T

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:21.618
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BASED

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:24.521
RESEMBLED -- I THINK THERE IS --

00:50:24.588 --> 00:50:27.624
ISSUE WHERE -- YOU CAN COMBINE

00:50:27.691 --> 00:50:29.659
RETROFIT -- FOR EARTHQUAKE AND

00:50:29.726 --> 00:50:32.062
COMBINE AND RETROFIT FOR

00:50:32.129 --> 00:50:32.896
WILDFIRE.

00:50:32.963 --> 00:50:35.432
AND THEN EVERYBODY.

00:50:35.499 --> 00:50:37.033
AND THE STATE WOULD HAVE SOME

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:38.935
INTEREST AS OPPOSED TO BEING AN

00:50:39.002 --> 00:50:44.541
EARTHQUAKE AREA OR FIRE AREA OR

00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:46.476
WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE.

00:50:46.543 --> 00:50:48.712
DISTRICT HAS THE YOU KNOW OF NO

00:50:48.779 --> 00:50:50.347
IT'S A BENEFIT -- THE ADVERSE

00:50:50.414 --> 00:50:51.748
DEAL BEING BOTH EARTHQUAKE AND

00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:52.516
FIRE.

00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:53.817
SO YEAH [inaudible]

00:50:53.884 --> 00:50:55.952
WHAT BUT?

00:50:56.019 --> 00:50:57.554
BUT BUT IF I BATRES QUAKE

00:50:57.621 --> 00:51:00.190
INSURANCE MONEY YOUR COMPANIES

00:51:00.257 --> 00:51:02.492

THE THE SENATE OF THE ASSESSMENT.

00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:16.440
THE THE LIKELY ASSESSMENT THAT

00:51:16.506 --> 00:51:17.374
THAT COULD HAPPEN SOMEDAY

00:51:17.441 --> 00:51:18.742
BLESSING HALF A PERCENT

00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:19.409
PROBABILITY THAT EVER WILL BUT

00:51:19.476 --> 00:51:21.044
IT BIT THEM ON THAT WOULD BE

00:51:21.111 --> 00:51:23.046
MADE ON ON ALL THE LINES LISTED

00:51:23.113 --> 00:51:24.648

BUT THAT'S BECAUSE IN EXCHANGE

00:51:34.124 --> 00:51:35.192
WE'VE BEEN OUT THERE

00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:36.660

EVERY YEAR UNTIL THAT VERY

00:51:39.296 --> 00:51:40.497
UNLIKELY EVENT OCCURS.

00:51:40.564 --> 00:51:41.731
AND IF YOU SEE THE POINT SO

00:51:41.798 --> 00:51:43.467
EVERY HOMEOWNER IN CALIFORNIA

00:51:43.533 --> 00:51:44.968
HIGH SEISMIC ZONE WOULD BE

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:46.870
ELIGIBLE FOR THIS THIS RETROFIT

I DO NOT HAVE A SEAT POLICY

00:51:54.744 --> 00:51:55.378
THAT'S BECAUSE THIS PUBLIC

00:51:55.445 --> 00:51:56.513
ENTITY.

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:57.581

00:51:57.647 --> 00:51:58.615
AT IT WE'RE HERE TO MAKE

00:51:58.682 --> 00:52:00.283
CALIFORNIA A SAFER AND OUR

00:52:01.418 --> 00:52:02.686
PROGRAMS FOR EVERYONE.

00:52:02.752 --> 00:52:04.321
IT WOULD BE FOR EVERYONE TO IF

00:52:04.387 --> 00:52:05.255
WE COULD PUT MORE MONEY BEHIND

00:52:05.322 --> 00:52:06.790
SO WE COULD RICH FIT MORE OF

00:52:06.857 --> 00:52:08.124
THEIR INSURANCE HOMES IT AND

00:52:08.191 --> 00:52:09.559

WHO IS THAT WITH THEM THAT IS

00:52:14.831 --> 00:52:16.299
IRRELEVANT IF PEOPLE ARE

RETROFIT IT MAKE IT SAFER?

00:52:25.008 --> 00:52:25.542
THE TRADE OFF FOR THAT IS AN

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:26.109
ASSESSMENT ON ABOUT TWELVE

00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:26.743

YES ME AND I THINK IT'S

00:52:31.348 --> 00:52:32.249
IMPORTANT TO NOTE IN THE

00:52:32.315 --> 00:52:33.750
SCENARIO THAT YOU OUTLINED WITH

NOT TO PURCHASE EARTHQUAKE.

00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:47.163
YOU IN THE EVENT OF AN

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:48.798
EARTHQUAKE WOULD BE PAYING AN

00:52:48.865 --> 00:52:50.400
ASSESSMENT ON YOUR HOMEOWNER'S

00:52:50.467 --> 00:52:52.836

00:53:02.078 --> 00:53:03.647
IF IT WAS ALRIGHT.

00:53:03.713 --> 00:53:04.247
I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT IT

00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:05.415
BUT REMEMBER I MEAN.

00:53:05.482 --> 00:53:08.018
IF IT HAPPENED TO BE UNDER --

00:53:08.084 --> 00:53:10.253
OLDER THAN A HOME BUILT IN

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:10.854
NINETEEN EIGHTY OF COURSE AS

00:53:10.921 --> 00:53:11.955
WELL AND AGAIN WE'RE NOT ANTI

AND WE WANT TO GET THESE HOMES

00:53:16.459 --> 00:53:17.427
RETROFITTED.

00:53:17.494 --> 00:53:18.962
IT IS PURELY THE NON

PARTICIPATING INSURER ASSESSMENT

00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:22.766
THAT WE DO NOT SUPPORT LET'S

GET FINANCING FOR THE PROGRAM SO

00:53:27.604 --> 00:53:28.104
THAT WE CAN GET THESE HOMES

00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:28.905
PROTECTED.

00:53:28.972 --> 00:53:30.941
WHAT IS THE COST OF RETROFITTING

00:53:31.007 --> 00:53:33.677
A SAY IT'S A HALF A MILLION

00:53:33.743 --> 00:53:36.680
DOLLAR HOME?

00:53:36.746 --> 00:53:37.347
THE CURRENT REGS VISIT WERE ABLE

00:53:37.414 --> 00:53:38.214
TO DO ARE JUST FOR HOMES THAT

00:53:38.281 --> 00:53:39.883
SIT ON TOP OF A CRAWL SPACE M.

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:41.751
M. AT HALF A MILLION.

00:53:41.818 --> 00:53:42.519
THE BE ABOUT OF AT AMP AT A

00:53:42.586 --> 00:53:44.020
PRICE DIRECTOR IN SOUTHERN

00:53:44.087 --> 00:53:45.255
CALIFORNIA COST BETWEEN THREE

00:53:45.322 --> 00:53:46.690
AND FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:53:46.756 --> 00:53:48.024
IS MORE IS HIGHER IT IS MORE

00:53:48.091 --> 00:53:49.359
EXPENSIVE THE BAY AREA BECAUSE

00:53:49.426 --> 00:53:50.160
OF HIGHER COST OF LABOR

00:53:50.226 --> 00:53:52.062
MATERIALS COST BUT FIVE OR SIX

00:53:52.128 --> 00:53:52.862
THOUSAND BUCKS.

00:53:52.929 --> 00:53:54.531
SO OUR GRANTS PROVIDE THREE

00:53:54.598 --> 00:53:55.865
THOUSAND DOLLARS REIMBURSEMENT

00:53:55.932 --> 00:53:57.767
TO PEOPLE ARE SELECTED AT IN

00:53:57.834 --> 00:53:59.402
COULD BE THE PROGRAM SO IN

00:53:59.469 --> 00:54:00.337
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WERE ABLE TO

00:54:00.403 --> 00:54:01.571
COVER KIND OF MOST OF THE COST

00:54:01.638 --> 00:54:02.539
OF THE RETROFIT.

00:54:02.606 --> 00:54:04.074
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IT GOES A

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:05.642
LONG WAY TO A SITTING THE FIVE

00:54:05.709 --> 00:54:07.010
OR SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THAT

00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:07.877
A PERSON ENTERS.

00:54:07.944 --> 00:54:10.580
SO IT'S A GOOD PROGRAM STARTED

00:54:10.647 --> 00:54:11.147
TWENTY FOURTEEN WE KNOW RIP

00:54:11.214 --> 00:54:13.083

AT ALL OUR HOMES THAT ARE NOT CA

00:54:18.788 --> 00:54:20.857
INSURED -- IN AND WE HAVE MADE A

00:54:20.924 --> 00:54:22.359
DIFFERENCE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS

00:54:22.425 --> 00:54:23.493
IN WHICH IS PROGRAM BEEN

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:25.328
OPERATING NOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS

00:54:25.395 --> 00:54:25.929
WE'VE MADE THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS

00:54:25.996 --> 00:54:27.163
MORE RESILIENT.

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:28.698
WHICH WANT TO EXTEND THAT TO IT

00:54:28.765 --> 00:54:34.204
TOO IS THAT THE ALL OF THE HIGH

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:36.906
SEISMIC AREAS IN THE STATE.

HAVE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF

00:54:50.387 --> 00:54:52.188
QUESTIONS.

00:54:52.255 --> 00:54:53.690
BUT BE STRAIGHT WITH YOU THIS

00:54:53.757 --> 00:54:55.625
COMES AT A TIME WHERE I'M TRIPLE

00:54:55.692 --> 00:54:57.661
BOOKED AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME.

00:54:57.727 --> 00:54:58.862
IN TERMS OF BEING HERE HAVING TO

00:54:58.928 --> 00:55:00.530
BE OTHER PLACES.

00:55:00.597 --> 00:55:02.232
I JUST -- I'VE READ THIS

COMING OVER INSURE IT WITH ME.

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:07.003
BUT IS VERY COMPLEX AND IT'S

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:07.871
CHALLENGING TO GET MY HEAD

00:55:07.937 --> 00:55:09.305
AROUND IT AND YOU'VE DONE A GOOD

00:55:09.372 --> 00:55:10.707
JOB OF TRYING TO EXPLAIN IT TO

00:55:10.774 --> 00:55:13.176

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:14.411
YOU THAT.

00:55:14.477 --> 00:55:15.745
BUT THIS DOES COME AT A TIME

00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:17.547
WHERE WE'VE HAD REALLY A MATTER

00:55:17.614 --> 00:55:18.782
OF DAYS TO TRY TO STUDY

00:55:18.848 --> 00:55:20.383
SOMETHING VERY COMPLEX AND VERY

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:21.051
SERIOUS.

00:55:21.117 --> 00:55:25.055
NOW I I GIVE YOU ENORMOUS PROPS

00:55:25.121 --> 00:55:26.890
FOR IDENTIFYING A PROBLEM -- BUT

00:55:26.956 --> 00:55:27.524
IS NOT ONE NECESSARILY THAT CAN

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:28.792
BE SOLVED BY WHAT YOU PUT ON THE

00:55:28.858 --> 00:55:30.694
TABLE BUT YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED A

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.028
PROBLEM YOU'VE IDENTIFIED.

00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:33.396
THE LOSS OF PREMIUMS THAT WE

00:55:33.463 --> 00:55:34.931
PAID OUT OVER TWENTY YEARS FIVE

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:35.965
BILLION DOLLARS.

00:55:36.032 --> 00:55:37.300
AND WHAT DO WE GET OUT OF THAT

00:55:37.367 --> 00:55:38.601
YOU KNOW A QUARTER OF A MILLION

00:55:38.668 --> 00:55:40.103
DOLLARS OR WHATEVER IT THE PAY I

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:42.305
I GET WHY IN HINDSIGHT.

00:55:42.372 --> 00:55:43.239
YOU LOOK AT THAT CIRCUMSTANCE

00:55:43.306 --> 00:55:44.874
AND YOU SAY HEY THAT WASN'T

00:55:44.941 --> 00:55:46.476
REALLY A GOOD DEAL WE COULD USE

00:55:46.543 --> 00:55:47.844
THAT MONEY AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:55:47.911 --> 00:55:49.979
BUT WE WE CAN'T MAKE POLICIES

00:55:50.046 --> 00:55:51.748
IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW I SHOULD HAVE

00:55:51.815 --> 00:55:53.183
INVESTED IN THAT STOCK OKAY.

00:55:53.249 --> 00:55:55.018
AND SO I APPRECIATE WHY IT'S

00:55:55.085 --> 00:55:56.720
FRUSTRATING TO TO SEE ALL OF OUR

00:55:56.786 --> 00:55:58.955
PREMIUMS ON THE EARTHQUAKES

00:55:59.022 --> 00:56:00.757
GOING TO RE INSURANCE.

00:56:00.824 --> 00:56:01.257
RIGHT.

00:56:01.324 --> 00:56:02.826
WE'VE COVERED THAT OBLIGATION

00:56:02.892 --> 00:56:04.360
BUT WE GOT NOTHING REALLY OUT OF

00:56:04.427 --> 00:56:05.729
IT THAT WE CAN CONTINUE ON I I

00:56:05.795 --> 00:56:07.497
SHARE THAT FRUSTRATION IT IS.

00:56:07.564 --> 00:56:09.999
IT IS WORRISOME BUT AT AT AT THE

00:56:10.066 --> 00:56:11.201
FUNDAMENTAL TO THAT

00:56:11.267 --> 00:56:12.869
CIRCUMSTANCES OUR WILLINGNESS TO

00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:14.337
TAKE RISKS.

00:56:14.404 --> 00:56:15.805
RIGHT AND YOU HAVE A PROPOSAL ON

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:17.107
HOW YOU WANT TO MANAGE THE RISK

00:56:17.173 --> 00:56:18.408
BUT THAT'S AT THE FUNDAMENTAL

00:56:18.475 --> 00:56:20.677
ELEMENTS OF THESE CHOICES THAT

00:56:20.744 --> 00:56:21.344
WE MAKE.

00:56:21.411 --> 00:56:26.816
I ON IN THIS IN THIS SPACE OKAY --

00:56:26.883 --> 00:56:29.152
THE I THINK THE BRAZEN BALL

00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:30.453
WHICH OF COURSE IS AN INCREDIBLY

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:32.088
WORTHY PROGRAM. FOR ME AT LEAST

00:56:32.155 --> 00:56:33.757
IS AN ENORMOUS DISTRACTION.

00:56:33.823 --> 00:56:35.358
I SUPPORT BRACE SIMPLE AND

00:56:35.425 --> 00:56:36.726
EFFECTIVE IT'S A PRIORITY OF THE

00:56:36.793 --> 00:56:37.827
STATE TO BRACE INVOLVED IN

00:56:37.894 --> 00:56:39.095
WHAT'S TAKE A HUNDRED MILLION

00:56:39.162 --> 00:56:41.264
OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND ONE TIME

00:56:41.331 --> 00:56:43.166
AND GET IT ALL DONE RIGHT -- BUT

00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:44.634
I I'VE I'VE SEEN IN MY

00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:46.836
LEGISLATIVE CAREER AND BEYOND.

00:56:46.903 --> 00:56:48.271
HI.

00:56:48.338 --> 00:56:49.639
WHATEVER WHATEVER IT IS OKAY

00:56:49.706 --> 00:56:52.008
WHATEVER IT IS BUT I HAVE SEEN

IS NOT NECESSARILY -- ABOUT

00:57:45.662 --> 00:57:46.796
MODERNIZING.

00:57:46.863 --> 00:57:48.498
I IT'S NOT ABOUT.

00:57:48.565 --> 00:57:50.300
TAKING LESS CASH OUT OF THE

00:57:50.366 --> 00:57:52.535
BUDGET -- BUT BUT IT'S REALLY

00:57:52.602 --> 00:57:54.170
THERE'S LOTS OF CHOICES IN THAT

00:57:54.237 --> 00:57:56.072
SPACE THERE REALLY IS AND THIS

00:57:56.139 --> 00:57:57.140
IS ONE OF THOSE CHOICES WERE YOU

00:57:57.207 --> 00:57:59.876

00:57:59.943 --> 00:58:01.644
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS -- BACK

TAX OR WHAT HOW WE WANT TO

00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:05.081
CHARACTERIZE IT AND THAT'S HOW

00:58:05.148 --> 00:58:06.149
WE'RE GONNA MAKE UP -- AT BEING

00:58:06.216 --> 00:58:08.251
ABLE TO SKIM OFF THE MONEY.

00:58:08.318 --> 00:58:09.752
THAT WE CAN USE FOR A GOOD

00:58:09.819 --> 00:58:11.521
PURPOSE WHATEVER ITS BRACE

00:58:11.588 --> 00:58:12.622
INVOLVED OR WHATEVER IT IS.

00:58:12.689 --> 00:58:13.857
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A GREAT

00:58:13.923 --> 00:58:15.558
CONVERSATION TO HAVE I I THINK

00:58:15.625 --> 00:58:17.126
IT'S EXCELLENT AND I AND I THINK

00:58:17.193 --> 00:58:19.028
THERE'S A LOT OF THERE'S A LOT

00:58:19.095 --> 00:58:20.964
OF OPTIONS IN THAT SPACE REALLY.

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:22.632
THIS COULD BE A GREAT.

00:58:22.699 --> 00:58:23.433
ONE THIS DID THIS FOR ME AT

00:58:23.499 --> 00:58:25.034
LEAST THIS IS JUST THIS IS AN

00:58:25.101 --> 00:58:25.835
OPTION.

00:58:25.902 --> 00:58:27.337
AND IS A LOT OF WAYS TO DECIDE

00:58:27.403 --> 00:58:29.639
HOW WE WANT TO MANAGE THAT RISK

00:58:29.706 --> 00:58:31.107
AND MAKE THOSE CHOICES.

00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:32.976
IN THAT SPACE AND IT'S A WERE

00:58:33.042 --> 00:58:33.977
THE WERE THE WERE THE

00:58:34.043 --> 00:58:43.453
CONVERSATION BUT I DO FEEL --

00:58:43.519 --> 00:58:44.821
THE I. UNDER PRESSURE. TO MAKE A

00:58:44.888 --> 00:58:46.122
CHOICE TODAY ABOUT SOMETHING

00:58:46.189 --> 00:58:46.689
THAT I AGREE WITH YOU IS AN

00:58:46.756 --> 00:58:46.923
ISSUE.

00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:47.624
IN THE CONTEXT OF A LOT OF

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:48.725
THINGS INCLUDING HOW WE'RE GONNA

00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:49.525
HAVE MANAGE FIRE RISK IN OUR

00:58:49.592 --> 00:58:50.159
STATE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT'S

00:58:50.226 --> 00:58:51.127
RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.

00:58:51.194 --> 00:58:51.761
RIGHT NOW IN FACT A MATTER OF

00:58:51.828 --> 00:58:52.896
WEEKS OR SO TO SOLVE THAT

00:58:52.962 --> 00:58:54.664
PROBLEM HOW WE GONNA MANAGE

00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:55.531
VIRUS.

00:58:55.598 --> 00:58:56.833
SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY WORTHY

00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:58.534
CONVERSATION AND I SO ADMIRE

00:58:58.601 --> 00:58:59.836

FEEL THAT THIS PRESSURE OF A

00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:04.874
CHOICE TODAYIS A WORRISOME ONE

00:59:04.941 --> 00:59:05.875
FOR ME.

00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:07.110
THAT'S MY HONEST FEEDBACK ABOUT

00:59:07.176 --> 00:59:08.645
CAN I JUST MANAGER WENT JUST

YOUR ISSUES VERY MUCH BUT WHAT I

00:59:16.486 --> 00:59:18.354
WOULD SUGGEST IN THIS DYNAMIC IS

00:59:18.421 --> 00:59:19.756
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I

00:59:19.822 --> 00:59:21.457
INVENTED YESTERDAY.

00:59:21.524 --> 00:59:22.325
THERE'S OR CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE

00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:23.960
AUTHORITY THERE'S A TWENTY FIVE

00:59:24.027 --> 00:59:24.794
YEAR TRACK RECORD.

00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:25.962
THE AUTHORITY IS CONTROLLED BY

00:59:26.029 --> 00:59:26.763
THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE

00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:28.498
TREASURER IN A FIFTEEN HUNDRED

00:59:28.564 --> 00:59:29.132
STAFF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER'S

00:59:29.198 --> 00:59:29.732
OFFICE.

00:59:29.799 --> 00:59:30.867
THEREFORE THE PROFESSIONALS OF

00:59:30.934 --> 00:59:32.435
THIS IS THEIR ANALYSIS THEIR JOB

00:59:32.502 --> 00:59:33.703
THEIR HOMEWORK.

00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:35.171
NOTHING IS HAPPENING HERE WHAT

00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:36.406
WE'RE DOING SOMETHING WE WERE

00:59:36.472 --> 00:59:37.907
INVENTING SOMETHING BRAND NEW OR

00:59:37.974 --> 00:59:39.876
CHANGING THE LAW THERE'S NEVER

00:59:39.943 --> 00:59:41.077
BEEN TESTED OR STUDIED.

00:59:41.144 --> 00:59:42.912
THEY SPENT YEARS WORKING ON THIS

00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:45.048
THING AND AND THEIR PROFESSIONAL

00:59:45.114 --> 00:59:46.783
OPERATION THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

00:59:46.849 --> 00:59:48.484
TAKE ANY RISK. TO ADVERSELY

00:59:48.551 --> 00:59:50.186
AFFECT THE INSURANCE POLICY

00:59:50.253 --> 00:59:52.155
HOLDERS OR ANYBODY ELSE YOU'VE

00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:53.957
GOT UNBELIEVABLE FRAZIER

00:59:54.023 --> 00:59:55.725
APPLICATIONBY THE WAY IT WAS

00:59:55.792 --> 00:59:56.626
APRIL FIRST LET'S TWELFTH AT

00:59:56.693 --> 00:59:58.061
THIS AMENDMENTS CAME IN BUT IN

00:59:58.127 --> 00:59:59.429
ANY EVENT THE DISCUSSIONS HAVE

00:59:59.495 --> 01:00:01.431
BEEN GOING ON WITH THEM AND

01:00:01.497 --> 01:00:02.098
EVERYBODY ELSE'S EVERYBODY

01:00:02.165 --> 01:00:03.533
BEHIND IT KNOWS ABOUT THIS FOR A

01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:04.200
LONG.

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:06.035
TIME AND SO I WOULD JUST SUGGEST

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:07.503
THAT THIS IS THAT YOU'RE CORRECT

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:09.772
ALWAYS TO BE IS A LAST MINUTE

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:12.108
YOU'RE CORRECT ALWAYS I GUESS

01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:12.809
THE STORY THAT FEELING RUSHED

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:13.843
ALL I'M TELLING YOU IS THERE'S A

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:15.511
VERY STRONG FRAMEWORK WITH THE

01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:16.579
GOVERNOR.

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:17.981
INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND THE

01:00:18.047 --> 01:00:20.416
TREASURER ALL OF WHOM HAVE A

01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:22.385
GIGANTIC STAFF THAT WORK THROUGH

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:24.454
THIS IN GREAT DETAIL AND BELIEVE

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.089
ME IF YOU'RE RISK AVERSE THEY

01:00:26.155 --> 01:00:27.390
ARE TRIPLE RISK AVERSE BECAUSE

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:28.624
THAT'S THEIR NATURE.

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:30.360
AND SO THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE I

01:00:30.426 --> 01:00:31.394
THINK IN TERMS OF WHAT THE

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:33.129
DISTINCTION IS WITH RESPECT TO

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:34.430

01:00:35.531 --> 01:00:37.200
COCKAMAMIE IDEA.

01:00:37.266 --> 01:00:38.935
THAT HAD NOT HAD THE FRAMEWORK

01:00:39.002 --> 01:00:41.070
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN IT BECAUSE

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:42.238
THEY'VE THEY'VE REALLY SCRUB

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:44.240
THIS AND THEY CAN GIVE YOU THE

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:45.742

TRYING TO BE RESPONSIBLE IN

01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:26.495
THINKING THIS THROUGH THROUGH AN

01:04:26.562 --> 01:04:28.831

EVERYTHING IS GONE.

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:41.177
AND THEN THERE'S A THE REASON

01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:42.612
WHY WE CAPITA TEN YEARS OF AT A

01:04:42.678 --> 01:04:43.879
CERTAIN LIMóN POLICY ALONG

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:45.615
THESE POLICIES IS TO GIVE PEOPLE

01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:46.882

GOING ON FOREVER.

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:49.652
IN THE EVENT THAT HAPPENS NOW%

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:51.120
QUITE FRANKLY JUST LIKE WHAT'S

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:52.288
HAPPENING WITH THE WILD FIRES

01:04:52.355 --> 01:04:53.823
PEOPLE ARE SAYING ALL THIS IS

01:04:53.889 --> 01:04:55.091
GREAT LIABILITY THE TRUTH OF THE

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:56.359
MATTER IS YOU DON'T PAY ALL THE

01:04:56.425 --> 01:04:57.693

CONTINUE TO GET RE GENERATED SO

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:04.367
I WOULD SUGGEST REAL QUITE

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:05.668
FRANKLY THAT THE THAT THE ODDS

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:07.036
ARE EVEN LESS.

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:08.137
BECAUSE YOU DON'T PAY ALL

01:05:08.204 --> 01:05:09.438
DOLLARS ON DAY ONE IT'S NOT LIKE

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:11.107
A DEATH BENEFIT SOMEBODY PASSES

01:05:11.173 --> 01:05:12.341

PROVIDE THIS PROGRAM ACROSS THE

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:28.824
BOARD TO SO MANY MORE PEOPLE

01:05:28.891 --> 01:05:29.525
BECAUSE IF THERE IS AN

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:30.860
EARTHQUAKE WE CAN TALK ABOUT

01:05:30.926 --> 01:05:32.161
RISK ALL DAY LONG.

01:05:32.228 --> 01:05:33.496
BUT OUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE

01:05:33.562 --> 01:05:35.665
PUBLIC AND HERE'S A WAY THAT

01:05:35.731 --> 01:05:37.099
DOESN'T COST ANYBODY A DIME.

01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:38.901
I TO DIE IN THAT WILL HAVE THE

01:05:38.968 --> 01:05:40.736
IMMEDIATE IMPACT TO PROTECT THE

01:05:40.803 --> 01:05:42.805
PUBLIC ON A HYPOTHETICAL RISK.

01:05:42.872 --> 01:05:45.007
AT THE BACK AND AFTER FIFTEEN

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:47.143
BILLIONS PAID AND I WOULD ARGUE

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:48.177
THESE EVEN WORSE THAN THAT AND

01:05:48.244 --> 01:05:49.312
WHAT HAPPENS IS THE INSURANCE

01:05:49.378 --> 01:05:51.247
INDUSTRY IS COMFORTABLE OF

01:05:51.314 --> 01:05:52.882
COURSE IN THEIR DEAL SINCE WHAT

01:05:52.948 --> 01:05:54.150
THE PICTURES COMMISSIONER SAID

01:05:54.216 --> 01:05:55.484
WHICH IS WE'VE GOT TO BE

01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:56.752
CREATIVE.

01:05:56.819 --> 01:05:59.121
AS WE FACE THESE RISKS THAT'S

01:05:59.188 --> 01:05:59.488
SIMPLE.

01:05:59.555 --> 01:06:01.557

01:06:11.901 --> 01:06:13.836
REAL POSSIBILITY TO TRY TO MAKE

01:06:13.903 --> 01:06:14.437

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:33.022
IN BEING SOMEONE WHO'S PUTTING A

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:34.690
TAX BILL ON THE SENATE FLOOR I

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:36.192
BELIEVE THAT THE OPINION THAT

01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:48.704
TRY.

01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:49.372
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SOLVE THAT

01:06:49.438 --> 01:06:50.039
I'M TRYING TO DO WHAT'S CALLED A

TO MAKE A DETERMINATION FIRST

01:06:56.712 --> 01:06:58.047
BEFORE THIS GOES INTO LAW.

01:06:58.114 --> 01:06:59.749

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:39.715
I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IS

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:42.184
BRACING VULTURE CORE MISSION IS

01:08:42.251 --> 01:08:44.887
THE CA.

01:08:44.954 --> 01:08:46.989
MHM ETCETERA FOCUSING ON BRACING

01:08:47.056 --> 01:08:48.824
BOLT AND I THOUGHT I AM A POLICY

01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:50.092
HOLDER BY THE WAY.

01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:52.962
AND I THOUGHT SEE A WAS AN

01:08:53.028 --> 01:08:54.129
EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE COMPANY.

01:08:54.196 --> 01:08:54.663
WE ARE ABSOLUTE OF QUAKE

01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:56.165
INSURANCE WE'D RICHER MORE THAN

01:08:56.232 --> 01:08:57.199
MILLION HOMES WE DO HAVE THIS

01:08:57.266 --> 01:08:58.901
LEGISLATIVE MANDATE.

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:00.002
THAT WE PROMOTE MITIGATION AS

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:01.203
WELL SO THIS IS.

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:02.571
THIS IS REALLY A MATTER OF

01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:04.073
ALLOWING US TO AND SHE'S A

01:09:04.139 --> 01:09:05.574
REINSURANCE SAVING SO WE CAN

01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:06.609
BETTER FIT MORE HOMES BUT I MEAN

01:09:06.675 --> 01:09:07.810
IT'S WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:09.612
SOCIAL POLICY HERE NOT.

01:09:09.678 --> 01:09:11.747
AN INSURANCE COVERAGE YOU YOUR

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:17.686
YOUR GROUP OF FILLING A SOCIAL --

01:09:17.753 --> 01:09:19.154
POLICY OBLIGATION THAT SOMEBODY

01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:20.256
PUT ON YOU IS SEE A TO RETROFIT

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:21.657
HOMES THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO IS

01:09:21.724 --> 01:09:24.593
SEE A POLICY HOLDERS RIGHT -- WE

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:25.728
ARE THE ANY WE DON'T HAVE TO DO

01:09:25.794 --> 01:09:26.595
IN THIS ISSUE THAT -- IT WE WE

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.097
WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE LEGISLATIVE

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:28.864
MANDATE TO WORK TOWARDS

01:09:28.931 --> 01:09:30.633
MITIGATION AND THE WAY THAT

01:09:30.699 --> 01:09:31.367
WORKS IS.

01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:32.368
THAT THE LET THAT SUCH AS THAT

01:09:32.434 --> 01:09:33.469
CREATED US.

01:09:33.536 --> 01:09:35.170
MANDATES THAT 5% OF OUR

01:09:35.237 --> 01:09:36.972
INVESTMENT INCOME GO INTO IT

01:09:37.039 --> 01:09:39.108
LOST ME THE GOING TO FIND MANY

01:09:39.174 --> 01:09:39.875
FUNDING MITIGATION.

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:41.076
AS WE DEVELOP THIS PROGRAM AND

01:09:41.143 --> 01:09:42.444
WE'RE DOING TWO THOUSAND HOMES

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:44.914
BUT THERE'S OVER THE AT IS OVER

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:46.115
FIVE MILLION HOMES THAT NEED TO

01:09:46.181 --> 01:09:47.850
BE RETROFITTED SAID GETTING MORE

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:49.685
THAN YOUR OWN LAW SHE MANY RIGHT

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:50.786
EVERYBODY ELSE THAT'S RIGHT.

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:53.756
INSURED IN THE UNINSURED WAS

01:09:53.822 --> 01:09:55.257
RIGHT.

01:09:55.324 --> 01:10:00.362
SO I'M I MEAN I WATCHED WANTED --

01:10:00.429 --> 01:10:02.064
THIS GOOD IT'S A NOBLE EFFORT.

01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:02.665
SO THEN THAT LEADS TO MY NEXT

01:10:02.731 --> 01:10:03.232
QUESTION AND I'M TRYING TO

01:10:03.299 --> 01:10:03.832
ANALYZE WHY ARE WE DOING THIS

01:10:03.899 --> 01:10:04.433
NOW.

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.901
IF IT'S A HUNDRED YEAR VENTURA

01:10:05.968 --> 01:10:06.769
FOUR HUNDRED YEAR VENTURA FIFTY

01:10:06.835 --> 01:10:08.270
YEAR EVENT.

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:09.805
WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT IT?

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:11.140
IF AND WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS

01:10:11.206 --> 01:10:12.541
AND DECIDE WHO NEEDS TO BE

01:10:12.608 --> 01:10:14.443
ASSESSED AND WHETHER THE GENERAL

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:15.945
FUND CAN COVER THE LOSS OR WHY

01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:19.248
ARE WE ARE WE VOTING ON THIS NOW.

01:10:19.315 --> 01:10:21.083
BECAUSE SIDE TO SAY WE SHOULDN'T

01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:23.218
WAIT IS A NINETY NINE POINT 7%

01:10:23.285 --> 01:10:25.187
PROBABILITY OF A SIX POINT SEVEN

01:10:25.254 --> 01:10:26.288
EARTHQUAKE THAT SIZE IN

01:10:26.355 --> 01:10:26.956
NORTHRIDGE.

01:10:27.022 --> 01:10:28.290
HAPPENING AGAIN SOMETIME THE

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:29.992
NEXT THIRTY YEARS THEY THEY

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:30.793
DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN AND

01:10:30.859 --> 01:10:31.327
WHERE.

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:32.227
QUESTION I APOLOGIZE NO

01:10:32.294 --> 01:10:35.130
DISRESPECT BUT I THINK THE

01:10:35.197 --> 01:10:36.165
ANSWER THE QUESTION AS THE

01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:37.566
RATING AGENCIES JUST LIKE WERE

01:10:37.633 --> 01:10:38.567
FACING WITH INVESTOR OWNED

01:10:38.634 --> 01:10:40.002
UTILITIES BANKRUPTCIES ARE

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:40.903
SAYING.

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:43.238
IN ORDER TO GIVE THE TRIPLE A

01:10:43.305 --> 01:10:45.107
RATING THAT'S REQUIRED.

01:10:45.174 --> 01:10:48.377
WE NEED. ONE IN FOUR HUNDRED

01:10:48.444 --> 01:10:51.380
YEAR OF AND COVERAGE OKAY THAT'S

01:10:51.447 --> 01:10:52.514
SEVENTEEN POINT SIX BILLION

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:55.784
DOLLARS WE MEET THAT COVERAGE BY.

01:10:55.851 --> 01:10:58.621
THE HUGE SWATH OF REINSURANCE.

01:10:58.687 --> 01:11:01.023
IF IT FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:02.358
IF WE COULD CREATE THIS

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:03.892
CONTINGENT LIABILITY ON THE

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:06.028
STACK WE ARE TOLD BY THE RATING

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:08.230
AGENCIES THAT THEY WILL MAINTAIN

01:11:08.297 --> 01:11:10.165
OUR RATING. FOR THAT BORROWING

01:11:10.232 --> 01:11:11.500
AND THE AND THE WORK OF THE AT

01:11:11.567 --> 01:11:12.601
THE ITS CRICKET OR YOU CAN BE

01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:14.536
MAINTAINED AS TRIPLE A WITHOUT

01:11:14.603 --> 01:11:16.472
HAVING TO WRITE A CHECK. FOR THE

01:11:16.538 --> 01:11:18.807
RE INSURANCE LOWER IN THE STACK

01:11:18.874 --> 01:11:20.476
THAT SAVES A HUNDRED MILLION SO

01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:22.845
THAT THE RATING AGENCIES WILL

01:11:22.911 --> 01:11:24.413
LEGALLY RELY.

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.815
ON THE CONTINGENCY LIABILITY AS

01:11:26.882 --> 01:11:28.751
AN ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:31.020
TRIPLE A RATING THAT'S ALL WE'RE

01:11:31.086 --> 01:11:35.658
TRYING TO DO WELL AS IF I WERE

01:11:35.724 --> 01:11:37.092
AN AIRPLANE OWNER THAT LIVED IN.

01:11:37.159 --> 01:11:38.460
FRESNO FOR EXAMPLE IF THAT'S NOT

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:39.528
AN EARTHQUAKE ZONE I DON'T KNOW.

01:11:39.595 --> 01:11:40.929
I MIGHT SAY WELL WHY ARE YOU

01:11:40.996 --> 01:11:41.530
GOING TO CAN ASSESS ME ON

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:43.432
CONTINGENCY WHY DON'T YOU DO A

01:11:43.499 --> 01:11:45.601
COUPLE THINGS WANTED TO RAISE

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:46.835
THE PREMIUM ON THE C. E. A

01:11:46.902 --> 01:11:49.071
POLICY HOLDERS TO BUILD A

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:50.572
SURPLUS.

01:11:50.639 --> 01:11:52.307
I'M SORRY THE THE OF I DON'T

01:11:52.374 --> 01:11:53.709
THINK FRESNO WAS IN HIGH SEISMIC

01:11:53.776 --> 01:11:55.678
AREA I'M ENTIRELY SURE ABOUT.

01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:56.278
SEVEN NEW SO THERE WOULD BE NO

01:11:56.345 --> 01:11:57.746
ASSESSMENT.

01:11:57.813 --> 01:11:59.181
ALL ON MY AIRPLANE OKAY CAM IS

01:11:59.248 --> 01:12:01.784
ONLY ASSESSMENTS IN HIGH RISK

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:03.652
ZONES.

01:12:03.719 --> 01:12:05.054
THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT'S A WE CAN

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.021
PERFORM MUCH OF HIS MEETING IF I

01:12:06.088 --> 01:12:07.089
COULD JUST GET BACK TO THE

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:08.190
QUESTION YES.

01:12:08.257 --> 01:12:09.191
IN TERMS TO CLARIFY OKAY MY

01:12:09.258 --> 01:12:11.093
QUESTION HAD TO DO WITH WHY ARE

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:11.694
WE DOING IT NOW.

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.429
AND IF THE EVENT OCCURS IN

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:14.763
TWENTY FIVE YEARS OR THE EVENT

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:16.098
OCCURS IN FIFTY YEARS THE

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:17.499
CALIFORNIA BUDGET INSTEAD OF

01:12:17.566 --> 01:12:19.435
BEING TWO HUNDRED BILLION MIGHT

01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:21.370
BE SIX HUNDRED BILLION.

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:22.371
BECAUSE CENTER THAT IS TOO LATE

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:23.572
AND WENT OVER WHO IN UNTIL AFTER

01:12:23.639 --> 01:12:24.940
THE EARTHQUAKE OCCURS IN HOUSES

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:26.208
TUMBLE OFF THEIR FOUNDATION

01:12:26.275 --> 01:12:27.676
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T RETROFITTED.

01:12:27.743 --> 01:12:28.610
WE WOULD HAVE MISSED AN

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:29.278
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A HOME SAFER

01:12:29.344 --> 01:12:31.747
THAT'S MY POINT THE DRIVER HERE.

01:12:31.814 --> 01:12:34.383
IS NOT ANYTHING ELSE ANYTHING

01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:35.851
OTHER THAN THE BRAZEN.

01:12:35.918 --> 01:12:37.553
BALL PROGRAM AND IF THAT'S THE

01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:39.388
DRIVER THAN LETTER WE FIND A

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:40.255
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS SOME

01:12:40.322 --> 01:12:42.891
PLACE ELSE AS OPPOSED TO PUTTING

01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:44.326
A CONTINGENT IS.

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:45.461
ON AIRPLANE OWNERS AND AND

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:48.230
PEOPLE WHO OWN UP CONDOS IN

01:12:48.297 --> 01:12:49.798
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS WHERE

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:50.299
THEY'RE GOING TO PAY THE

01:12:50.365 --> 01:12:53.135
ASSESSMENT ON THEIR ON THEIR

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:54.269
THEIR HOME AT THEIR CONDO.

01:12:54.336 --> 01:12:56.205
POLICY AND THEN PAY THE

01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:57.306
ASSESSMENT THAT THE HOMEOWNERS

01:12:57.372 --> 01:12:59.608
ASSOCIATION PASSES ON TO THEM IN

01:12:59.675 --> 01:13:00.943
THE HOMEOWNERS FEE.

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:01.777
SEE WHAT I'M SAYING.

01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:03.846
YES YEAH THE REASONS AS CENTER

01:13:03.912 --> 01:13:05.881
IF I COULD REAL QUICKLY.

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:07.249
AG IS WE WANT TO DO SO THE

01:13:07.316 --> 01:13:08.417
REASON IS IS THAT BECAUSE THIS

01:13:08.484 --> 01:13:09.818
GETS A HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR.

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:11.453
AND THAT IF IN THE EVENT IS IN

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.187
TWENTY YEARS WE WILL NOW HAVE

01:13:12.254 --> 01:13:14.189
BOLTED TWO BILLION DOLLARS WORTH

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:16.058
OF AND MAY BE ALMOST ALL THE

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:17.259
HOMES OF THE TO BE BOLTED IN

01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:18.927
CALIFORNIA. TO THE RISK AT THE

01:13:18.994 --> 01:13:20.329
TIME OF THE EVENT WILL BE

01:13:20.395 --> 01:13:21.797
DRAMATICALLY LESS AND WE WILL

01:13:21.864 --> 01:13:22.998
HAVE MITIGATED THAT.

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:24.633
AND IT'S NOT A ONE HUNDRED

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:25.501
MILLION DOLLAR COST REYES AND

01:13:25.567 --> 01:13:26.935
BOLD IT'S BILLIONS.

01:13:27.002 --> 01:13:28.771
AND SO HUNDRED MILLION THE YEAR

01:13:28.837 --> 01:13:31.774
OR A SAVINGS EVERY YEAR AND THE

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.742
THE IDEA IS THAT WERE BASICALLY

01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:35.811
SAVING IT BY REDUCING THE COST

01:13:35.878 --> 01:13:38.080
OF THE THE THE PREMIUMS TO THE

01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:40.215
REINSURANCE COMPANIES ON THE ONE

01:13:40.282 --> 01:13:40.916
HAND.

01:13:40.983 --> 01:13:42.084
AND ON A MORE MARING THAT

01:13:42.151 --> 01:13:43.218
IMMEDIATE PROTECTION AND

01:13:43.285 --> 01:13:45.888
IMMEDIATE MITIGATION AGAINST THE

01:13:45.954 --> 01:13:46.922
VERY HIGHLY UNLIKELY.

01:13:46.989 --> 01:13:48.123
THEORETICAL FOUGHT THAT YOUR

01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:50.626
AIRPLANE MIGHT GET TAXED IF YOU

01:13:50.692 --> 01:13:51.760
LIVE IN A MIGHT GET SET THE FEE

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:52.995
ON IT.

01:13:53.061 --> 01:13:54.596
IF YOU LIVE IN A HIGH ZONE A

01:13:54.663 --> 01:13:55.464
HIGH A HIGH EARTHQUAKE ZONE YOU

01:13:55.531 --> 01:14:01.370
UNDERSTAND THE OPTIC FOR US THE

01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:03.939
OPTIC IS WE'RE IF PEOPLE DON'T

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:05.841
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A OF THE

01:14:05.908 --> 01:14:06.341
ASSESSMENT IS ON IS ON A

01:14:06.408 --> 01:14:07.276
CONVENTION [inaudible]

01:14:07.342 --> 01:14:08.277
THE CONTINGENCY.

01:14:08.343 --> 01:14:10.212
WE'RE GOING TO VOTE ON SOMETHING

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:11.480
AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT A FEE ON

01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:13.081
SOME BORDER WHATEVER YOU CALL IT.

01:14:13.148 --> 01:14:14.349
YOUR ASSESSMENT ON SOMEBODY'S

01:14:14.416 --> 01:14:15.784
ACTIVITY OR PROPERTY.

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:18.754
IT HAS NO NEXUS.

01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:21.323
TO ALTON BRACE FOR EARTHQUAKES

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:22.524
OR ANYTHING ELSE BUT THAT IT'S

01:14:22.591 --> 01:14:23.125
NOT LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO SEE

01:14:23.192 --> 01:14:24.860
THE ASSESSMENT AND THEN THEY'RE

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:25.861
GONNA HAVE A BILL INCREASE BILL

01:14:25.928 --> 01:14:27.262
NOT GONNA HAPPEN WHAT'S GOING TO

01:14:27.329 --> 01:14:28.897
HAPPEN IS AFTER FIFTEEN BILLION

01:27:43.725 --> 01:27:44.959
THIS IS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

01:27:45.026 --> 01:27:46.361
THAT THE BIGGER CARRIERS GET

01:27:46.427 --> 01:27:47.662
OVER THE SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZE

01:27:47.729 --> 01:27:48.763
CARRIERS THAT ARE.

01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:49.664
COMMITTED TO THE STATE OF

01:27:49.731 --> 01:27:50.898
CALIFORNIA THEY DON'T HAVE A

01:27:50.965 --> 01:27:52.834
CHOICE TO PULL OUT OF THE STATE

01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:54.836
FOLLOWING A CATASTROPHE AND

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:55.637
RIGHT BUSINESS AND FORTY OTHER

01:27:55.703 --> 01:27:56.904
NINE STATE TO STAY IN BUSINESS.

01:27:56.971 --> 01:27:59.073
MY CARRIERS HAD TO STAY IN

01:27:59.140 --> 01:27:59.707
BUSINESS AND CONTINUE TO WRITE

01:27:59.774 --> 01:28:01.376
BUSINESS -- ON A DAILY BASIS

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:03.111
FOLLOWING NORTHRIDGE WERE THEY

01:28:03.177 --> 01:28:04.245
SUPPORTIVE OF THE CREATION TO

HOMEOWNERS MARKET FOR SURE.

01:28:07.782 --> 01:28:08.950
BUT THEY WERE ALSO VERY

01:28:09.017 --> 01:28:10.051
COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT IT

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:12.220
ALSO MADE THE BIGGER CARRIERS

01:28:12.286 --> 01:28:13.388
MORE COMPETITIVE.

01:28:13.454 --> 01:28:15.023
THAT WOULD SEE A JUST ANNOUNCED

01:28:15.089 --> 01:28:17.992
A RATE DECREASE IN DECEMBER.

01:28:18.059 --> 01:28:19.560

PROGRAM IT DOES HELP ALL PEOPLE

01:28:36.944 --> 01:28:37.478
IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE ARE VERY

01:28:37.545 --> 01:28:39.113
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS NEW NOTION.

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.182
OF CHANGING TWENTY TWO PLUS

01:28:41.249 --> 01:28:43.685
YEARS OF KIND OF A DEAL BETWEEN

01:28:43.751 --> 01:28:45.987
THE NON PARTICIPATING INSURERS

01:28:46.054 --> 01:28:48.222
AND THE PARTICIPATING ANSWERS AS

01:28:48.289 --> 01:28:49.724
I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY WE

01:28:49.791 --> 01:28:51.225
WHEN WE CREATED THE SEE A I WAS

01:28:51.292 --> 01:28:52.760
HERE FOR WE'VE MADE IT VERY

01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:54.128
CLEAR THAT THE FOUR WALLS AROUND

01:28:54.195 --> 01:28:55.663
THE C. E. A WERE.

01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:57.165
DESIGNED TO PROTECT BOTH

01:28:57.231 --> 01:28:59.534
PARTICIPATING INSURERS AND NON

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:00.835
PARTICIPATING INSURERS

01:29:00.902 --> 01:29:02.870
PARTICIPATING INSURERS DO NOT

01:29:02.937 --> 01:29:04.872
WANT NON PARTICIPATING INSURANCE

01:29:04.939 --> 01:29:06.808
POLICY HOLDERS ENTERING THE C.

01:29:06.874 --> 01:29:08.543
E. A THROUGH THOSE FOUR SOLID

01:29:08.609 --> 01:29:10.244
WALLS THAT WERE BUILT. TO

01:29:10.311 --> 01:29:12.213
PROTECT THE P. EYES BUT NOW THE

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:14.348
P. EYES ARE CA ARTS TRYING TO

01:29:14.415 --> 01:29:16.184
COME OUT FROM OVER THE FOUR

01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:18.619
WALLS INTO THE NON PARTICIPATING

01:29:18.686 --> 01:29:21.255
ENSURE SPACE. FOR THEIR BENEFITS

01:29:21.322 --> 01:29:23.357
AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CA

01:29:23.424 --> 01:29:24.759
AND GRANTED THE BENEFIT OF

01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:26.494
OTHERS THAT CAN EMBRACE YOU KNOW

01:29:26.561 --> 01:29:27.628
BE PART OF RECENT POLLS.

01:29:27.695 --> 01:29:29.497
BUT IT IS BEYOND JUST BRACING

01:29:29.564 --> 01:29:32.333
BOLD IN MY CARRIERS OPINIONS ARE

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:33.634
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY A NEW

01:29:33.701 --> 01:29:35.036
PRESIDENT AND SOMETHING IT TOOK

01:29:35.103 --> 01:29:36.571
US YEARS TO CREATE THE CA SIX

01:29:36.637 --> 01:29:37.972
TWO YEARS REALLY.

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:39.373
THREE QUITE FRANKLY TO REALLY

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:40.475
CREATE IT AND GET IT BUILT AND

01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:41.342
OUR BIGGEST CONCERN WAS THE

01:29:41.409 --> 01:29:42.777
EARTH WAS GONNA SHAKE ON DAY ONE

01:29:42.844 --> 01:29:44.612
AND WE'VE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH THAT

01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:46.080
HAS NOT WHERE YOU'RE REALLY

01:29:46.147 --> 01:29:50.318
SAYING IS.

01:29:50.384 --> 01:29:51.919
IS ME IS THE BENEFIT.

01:29:51.986 --> 01:29:53.087
OF THE BRACE AND BOLT.

01:29:53.154 --> 01:29:54.822
DOESN'T COMPARE WITH WHAT YOU

01:29:54.889 --> 01:29:55.223
FEEL THAT THAT.

01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:56.557
THE NEGATIVE DOWNSIDE WOULD BE

01:29:56.624 --> 01:29:58.426
OF THE SENTENCE.

01:29:58.493 --> 01:29:59.827
SOMEHOW BREAKING THE CORNERSTONE

01:29:59.894 --> 01:30:00.561
OF THE FOUR WALLS.

01:30:00.628 --> 01:30:02.630
THAT IS CORRECT [inaudible]

01:30:02.697 --> 01:30:10.238
HEY.

01:30:10.304 --> 01:30:13.307

01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:24.418
CUSTOMER.

01:30:24.485 --> 01:30:27.021
BUT WE WERE AT THE UP SEVENTY

OUR NEXT WE'RE GONNA GO TO

01:31:14.235 --> 01:31:16.437
SENATOR BRIDGES PLEASE. THIRTY

01:31:16.504 --> 01:31:20.541
SPOKE -- IS THE BRAZEN BOLD

01:31:20.608 --> 01:31:25.847
PROGRAM -- MANDATORY.

01:31:25.913 --> 01:31:26.614
IT'S NOT.

01:31:26.681 --> 01:31:27.615
AND THAT SEEMS TO BE BASED ON

01:31:27.682 --> 01:31:28.950
THE QUESTIONS I HEARD FROM

01:31:29.016 --> 01:31:31.419
CENTER -- GLAZER AND MAYBE

01:31:31.485 --> 01:31:33.120
CENTER ROTH.

01:31:33.187 --> 01:31:34.689
TO IS THAT ONE OF IS THAT THE

01:31:34.755 --> 01:31:37.458
MOST IMPORTANT OBJECTIVE.

01:31:37.525 --> 01:31:41.362
OF FOR YOU US HERTZBERG YES ALL

01:31:41.429 --> 01:31:41.562
RIGHT.

01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:42.663
SO.

01:31:42.730 --> 01:31:44.365
THIS IS NOT QUITE THE ON POINT

01:31:44.432 --> 01:31:46.500
BUT WE'VE A NITRATE PROBLEM.

01:31:46.567 --> 01:31:48.636
IN THE VALLEY.

01:31:48.703 --> 01:31:49.470
AND ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE

01:31:49.537 --> 01:31:52.607
HAD IS SEPTIC SYSTEMS IN LEAKAGE

01:31:52.673 --> 01:31:54.342
AND SO ON AND SO FORTH.

01:31:54.408 --> 01:31:54.909
SO THE PROGRAM THAT WAS PUT

01:31:54.976 --> 01:31:56.844
FORWARD -- WAS REALLY QUITE

01:31:56.911 --> 01:31:59.380
SIMPLE THAT THIS WAS A

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:01.716
COLLECTIVE PROBLEM -- EVEN

01:32:01.782 --> 01:32:03.484
THOUGH IT INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS

01:32:03.551 --> 01:32:06.153
WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR LEAKAGE AND

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:07.321
SO ON AND SO FORTH.

01:32:07.388 --> 01:32:10.758
AND SO HOOKING UP TO A MAIN LINE

01:32:10.825 --> 01:32:12.159
AS OPPOSED TO A SEPTIC SYSTEM

01:32:12.226 --> 01:32:14.662
WAS THE OBJECTIVE HOW DID YOU

01:32:14.729 --> 01:32:16.697
ACHIEVE THAT IN AN EQUITABLE WAY --

01:32:16.764 --> 01:32:19.800
THAT -- MADE THAT THREE TO FIVE

01:32:19.867 --> 01:32:20.434
THOUSAND DOLLAR.

01:32:20.501 --> 01:32:22.904
PRICE TAG PALATABLE WHICH SOUNDS

01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:24.839
LIKE YOUR BRACE PROGRAM IS

01:32:24.906 --> 01:32:26.207
AROUND THAT YES.

01:32:26.274 --> 01:32:28.476
GIVE OR TAKE.

01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:29.644
THE BILL THOUGH [inaudible]

01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:32.313
WHAT'S THAT.

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.015
BUT IF YOU LAST YEAR OKAY

01:32:34.081 --> 01:32:34.315
[inaudible]

01:32:34.382 --> 01:32:35.349
YOUR MIND.

01:32:35.416 --> 01:32:36.584
I GUESS THE IDEA WAS IS THAT IF

01:32:36.651 --> 01:32:40.187
WE GAVE -- INDIVIDUALS THREE TO

01:32:40.254 --> 01:32:40.688
FIVE YEARS.

01:32:40.755 --> 01:32:41.989
MAYBE SOME MEASURE THE FINANCING

01:32:42.056 --> 01:32:44.191
MECHANISM IF NECESSARY.

01:32:44.258 --> 01:32:46.594
OR UPON A PURCHASE A TRANSFER OF

01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:47.361
TITLE.

01:32:47.428 --> 01:32:50.231
THAT IT BE MANDATORY THAT YOU

01:32:50.298 --> 01:32:54.268

[inaudible]

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.541
OKAY.

01:33:00.608 --> 01:33:03.644
SO HOW IS THAT NOT ACHIEVING

01:33:03.711 --> 01:33:07.048
WHAT YOUR GOAL IS. FOR LEASE

01:33:07.114 --> 01:33:08.182
PART OF THIS AT LEAST PART OF

01:33:08.249 --> 01:33:09.984
THIS PROGRAM.

01:33:20.628 --> 01:33:22.596
CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN EARTHQUAKE

01:33:22.663 --> 01:33:24.298
ZONES.

WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHEN THEY

01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:27.702

WRITE THE CHECK.

01:33:29.036 --> 01:33:31.839
OUR JOB IN GOVERNMENT IS TO GET

THEY'VE GOT TO PAY.

01:33:40.014 --> 01:33:41.649
BUT THEN WHEN THEY FAIL TO COVER

01:33:41.716 --> 01:33:42.783

AND IN OTHER WORDS AND SO THE

01:33:51.359 --> 01:33:53.361
QUESTION HERE IS IT'S EASY TO

01:33:53.427 --> 01:33:55.229

01:34:09.477 --> 01:34:10.644
POINTS IN MY CLOTHES BUT BUT

01:34:10.711 --> 01:34:13.447
CLEARLY THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO

01:34:13.514 --> 01:34:15.049
GET IS BEHIND IT LITERALLY IF

01:34:15.116 --> 01:34:17.251
YOU CAN GET TWENTY TWENTY FIVE

01:34:17.318 --> 01:34:17.885
THOUSAND HOMES A YEAR BASS AND

BULL AND WE HAVE A TEN YEAR

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:20.454
EVENT TO RISE AND THIS IS A

01:34:20.521 --> 01:34:22.890
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON MITIGATING.

01:34:22.957 --> 01:34:25.226
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH WITH

01:34:25.292 --> 01:34:25.760
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS

01:34:25.826 --> 01:34:27.294
SOCIETY BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING TO

01:34:27.361 --> 01:34:28.963
HAPPEN IS JUST LIKE EVERY IS

01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.797

THEY'RE WET WHEN THEY'RE

01:34:37.638 --> 01:34:38.272
COMPOUNDS ARE COMPLETELY

01:34:38.339 --> 01:34:39.340
DESTROYED.

01:34:39.407 --> 01:34:40.708
BUT ALL THESE OTHER THINGS OCCUR

01:34:40.775 --> 01:34:41.475
AND WE'RE GOING TO SIT THERE AND

01:34:41.542 --> 01:34:42.777
TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT AND THE

01:34:42.843 --> 01:34:44.745
MORE WE CAN DO TO MITIGATE THAT

01:34:44.812 --> 01:34:47.415
UP FRONT EARLY BEFORE THE

01:34:47.481 --> 01:34:48.649
CATASTROPHE.

01:34:48.716 --> 01:34:52.486
IS WHAT MOTIVATES ME TO PROPOSE

01:34:52.553 --> 01:34:55.756
OPPOSE THIS BILL LYNN LIMIT.

01:34:55.823 --> 01:34:56.223
OF FINISH WITH THIS.

01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:57.625
YOU A THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD BE

01:34:57.691 --> 01:34:58.292
A POLICY.

01:34:58.359 --> 01:35:00.861
OR PROGRAM THAT WOULD BRING

01:35:00.928 --> 01:35:02.029

ANOTHER THE BASEBALL PROGRAM

01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:14.141
THAT EXISTS IS VERY MINIMAL AND

01:35:14.208 --> 01:35:14.909
ONLY DOES COUPLE THOUSAND A YEAR

01:35:14.975 --> 01:35:16.277

THE SAVINGS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

01:35:19.613 --> 01:35:20.614
NO I I GUESS THE WHERE'S THE

01:35:20.681 --> 01:35:22.016
OWNERS THE IDEA THAT WE HAD IN

01:35:22.083 --> 01:35:23.050
THE VALLEY WAS THE ONUS WAS ON

IS THAT NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU

01:35:28.289 --> 01:35:29.857
CONTEMPLATED OR MAYBE DISCARDED

01:35:29.924 --> 01:35:31.225
IT BUT WHEN YOU DO CALL TO PLAY

01:35:31.292 --> 01:35:32.660

01:35:32.726 --> 01:35:33.994
FOUND ON STUFF LIKE THAT I

01:35:34.061 --> 01:35:35.429
CONTEMPLATED THE FACT THAT.

01:35:35.496 --> 01:35:37.965
WITHOUT IMPOSING UPON OTHER

01:35:38.032 --> 01:35:39.333
IMPORTANT CRITICAL FUNCTIONS OF

GOVERNMENT TO ASK FOR BILLIONS

01:35:41.535 --> 01:35:43.070

IF WE DON'T DO IT NOW WHEN.

01:36:39.126 --> 01:36:41.896

CENTER HYPOTHETICALLY AND WE

01:36:50.971 --> 01:36:52.006

LITERALLY CUT IN HALF THE DAMAGE

01:37:00.981 --> 01:37:02.383
IS GOING TO BE DONE BY A BIG

01:37:02.449 --> 01:37:03.050
EARTHQUAKE.

01:37:03.117 --> 01:37:05.352
BECAUSE WE'RE DOING PREVENTATIVE

01:37:05.419 --> 01:37:07.321
MEASURES LIKE GOING OUT AND

01:37:07.388 --> 01:37:08.622
SPENDING MONEY TO CLEAR I HELD A

01:37:08.689 --> 01:37:10.491
BIG HEARING WHEN I WAS CHAIRMAN

01:37:10.558 --> 01:37:11.559
OF NATURAL RESOURCES.

01:37:11.625 --> 01:37:12.459
TALKING ABOUT CLEARING OUT THE

01:37:12.526 --> 01:37:14.061
TREES NO ONE WANTED TO PAY

01:37:14.128 --> 01:37:15.129
ATTENTION NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN

01:37:15.196 --> 01:37:16.664
THE TREES ARE BURNING AND

01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:18.065

IT'S HARD TO HAVE A CONSTITUENCY

01:37:27.308 --> 01:37:28.909
FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE WE'RE

01:37:28.976 --> 01:37:31.378
TRYING TO BE PREVENTIVE AND IT'S

01:37:31.445 --> 01:37:32.413
EASY TO THROW ROADBLOCKS BUT IF

YOU HAD A HALF A MILLION HOMES

01:37:33.614 --> 01:37:35.416

THE DAMAGE THAT WOULD BE DONE IN

01:37:38.419 --> 01:37:39.820
THOSE EARTHQUAKE WRITTEN AREAS

01:37:39.887 --> 01:37:41.188
WOULD BE DRAMATICALLY LESS AND

01:37:41.255 --> 01:37:43.624
PEOPLE WOULD BE LESS IMPACTED IN

01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:49.330
TERMS OF THEIR LIVES THAT'S ALL

01:37:49.396 --> 01:37:49.897

FORWARD ON TO THE FLOOR IF IT'S

01:38:33.507 --> 01:38:34.575
A TAX WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE AND

01:38:34.642 --> 01:38:35.342
NUMBER TWO IF THE SUBSTANTIAL

01:38:36.944 --> 01:38:37.645
ANSWERED.

01:38:37.711 --> 01:38:38.612
TRYING TO DO I THINK A

01:38:38.679 --> 01:38:39.713
RESPONSIBLE THING I WANT TO

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:41.548
CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION IF I HAD

01:38:41.615 --> 01:38:43.217
A HORRIBLE MEETING LAST NIGHT

01:38:43.284 --> 01:38:44.818
WITH THE INDUSTRY FOLKS I FELT

01:38:44.885 --> 01:38:45.719
THERE WAS NO HOPE.

01:38:45.786 --> 01:38:47.354
BUT WE DISCUSSED A NUMBER OF

01:38:47.421 --> 01:38:49.923
THINGS IT'S NOT EASY -- BUT OKAY

01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:51.358
IT'S NOT EASY LET'S FIGURE IT

01:38:51.425 --> 01:38:53.427
OUT AND LET'S DEAL WITH THE

01:38:53.494 --> 01:38:54.962
ISSUES THAT CENTER MORLOCK HE'S

01:38:55.029 --> 01:38:55.829
CORRECT HE DEALT WITH THIS IN

01:38:55.896 --> 01:38:57.197
ORANGE COUNTY I DON'T THINK IS

01:38:57.264 --> 01:38:58.399
ANALYSIS WORKS HERE.

01:38:58.465 --> 01:38:59.366
AND I'LL HAVE A CONVERSATION

01:38:59.433 --> 01:39:00.801
OFFLINE BECAUSE WE SPEND TOO

01:39:00.868 --> 01:39:01.335
MUCH TIME IN THIS HEARING

01:39:01.402 --> 01:39:02.836
ALREADY BUT I JUST WANT TO BE

01:39:02.903 --> 01:39:04.772
ABLE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS

01:39:04.838 --> 01:39:05.539
I THINK IT'S A I THINK THESE

01:39:05.606 --> 01:39:06.907
PEOPLE ARE PROFESSIONAL.

01:39:06.974 --> 01:39:08.342
I THINK THE ORGANIZATION IS

01:39:08.409 --> 01:39:09.476
WORTHY I THINK YOU CAN PUT THE

01:39:09.543 --> 01:39:10.644
CHECKS AND BALANCES IN THEIR

01:39:10.711 --> 01:39:12.212
NECESSARY THAT EVERY QUESTION

01:39:12.279 --> 01:39:13.480
HERE THAT WAS ASKED.

01:39:13.547 --> 01:39:15.049
I CERTAINLY HAVE CONFIDENCE IN

01:39:15.115 --> 01:39:16.684
THE ADVOCATES THAT ARE OPPOSING

01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:17.951
THEY'RE GREAT THE HONORABLE

01:39:18.018 --> 01:39:19.186
PEOPLE AND I THINK THE REAL

01:39:19.253 --> 01:39:20.854
ISSUES THAT THEY RAISED I CAN

01:39:20.921 --> 01:39:22.489
SEE SOLUTIONS FORWARD.

01:39:22.556 --> 01:39:23.290
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IT DOESN'T

01:39:23.357 --> 01:39:25.259
HAPPEN BUT I JUST THINK IT'S OUR

01:39:25.326 --> 01:39:27.628
OBLIGATION TO GIVE IT A SHOT AND

01:39:27.695 --> 01:39:29.029
AND AND I I DON'T THINK I WOULD

01:39:29.096 --> 01:39:30.130
SAY IT WOULD SENATOR GLAZERS

01:39:30.197 --> 01:39:31.832
SAID WHICH I I JUST DON'T FEEL.

01:39:31.899 --> 01:39:32.766
AN EINER SO HE SAYS ON THE

01:39:32.833 --> 01:39:34.201
PRESSURE STUFF BECAUSE THIS IS

01:39:34.268 --> 01:39:36.003
AN ORGANIZATION ALREADY EXIST

01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:37.104
THAT'S BEEN THINKING THIS STUFF

01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:38.539
THROUGH IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY.

01:39:38.605 --> 01:39:40.607
AND I FEEL PRETTY COMFORTABLE

01:39:40.674 --> 01:39:41.175
AND I I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN

01:39:41.241 --> 01:39:42.443
SPENDING WHAT SIX MONTHS ON THIS
