ONE THAT BROUGHT A TRI CITIES AND GENOCIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE. VERY LITTLE OF CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN SLAVERY DURING THE MISSION PERIOD IS CAPTURED IN OUR HISTORY BOOKS SPANISH MISSIONARIES AND THE MILITARY SUB DUDE AND ENSLAVED CALIFORNIA'S NATIVE AMERICANS TO FORCED LABOR. AND DISPLACED FAMILY MEMBERS IN THEIR QUEST TO QUALITY COLONIZE THE ALREADY INHABITED CALIFORNIA. A MENTALITY THAT CARRIED FORWARD TO THE STATE'S EARLIEST LEADERS WITH THE FIRST GOVERNOR SETTING PAID BOUNTIES TO FORMALISATION IS AIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHO EMBARKED ON A DELIBERATE POLICY OF GENOCIDE. AS DEFINED BY POST HOLOCAUST HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNALS. WHAT PANEL CENTER SERVES AS A CONSTANT REMINDER OF THAT ERA A VIEWING CALIFORNIA INDIANS AS LESS THAN HUMAN. SOME ARGUE THAT SERRA SHOULD NOT BE JUDGED BY TODAY'S VALUES YES AS EARLY AS FIFTEEN THIRTY THE SPANISH KING CARLOS SAID I FOR BATES LEVER SLAVERY DUE TO MISTREATMENT OF INDIANS. AND IN FIFTEEN THIRTY SEVEN PAUL PAUL THE THIRD ISSUE AN ETIQUETTE TRYING TO EN MASSACRES AND SLAVE MEN OF INDIAN PEOPLES AND AGAIN FRENCH NAVY CAPTAIN JOHN FRANCIS THE GALA UPON ARRIVING IN MONTEREY BAY. MONTEREY BAY IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SIX WAS APPALLED BY THE MISSIONARIES ABUSE OF NATIVE AMERICANS RIDING CORPORAL PUNISHMENT IS INFLICTED ON THE INDIANS OF BOTH SEXES WHO NEGLECT THE EXERCISE OF BEAUTY AND MANY SINS WHICH IN EUROPE ARE LEFT TO DIVINE JUSTICE.

TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN POPE FRANCIS APOLOGIZE FOR THE MANY GRAVE SINS COMMITTED AGAINST THE NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE OF AMERICA AND ASKED FOR FORGIVENESS. YES FIFTY YEARS HIS STATUE HAS STOOD IN THE CAPITAL PART AS A CONSTANT REMINDER TO THE NATIVE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA OF THE ATROCITIES COMMITTED AGAINST THEM AND THE HORROR TREATMENT INFLICTED UPON THEM DURING THE SO CALLED COLONIZATION SPANISH PERIOD. THIS BILL WILL PAVE THE WAY FOR THE VOICES OF THOSE WHO WERE OPPRESSED IN SLAVE AND FORCED TO LABOR. TO BUILD THE MISSIONS TO ONCE AND FOR ALL HAVE A VOICE. A VOICE THAT WILL TELL A FACTUAL ACCOUNT OF HISTORY AND HAS BEEN WHAT THAT HAS BEEN ONE SIDED FOR MANY YEARS NOW IS THAT TIME FOR THAT VOICE TO BE HEARD. THIS BILL WILL BRING IN A NEW ERA ONE WHERE CALIFORNIA'S ELECTED DIRECTED OFFICIALS TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT THE WRONGS OF THE PAST AND TO RECOGNIZE THE IMMENSE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PEOPLE HAVE PAID TO THIS GREAT STATE. YEAH THE AMOUNTS PLUS. THAT CAME WITH IT. AB THREE THREE EIGHT WELL AUTHORIZED THE CONSTRUCTION OF A LONG OVERDUE MONUMENT TO THE TRIBES TO CONTINUE TO CALL THIS PLACE HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA HOME IT WILL BRING A LONG OVERDUE END TO THE MEMORIZATION OF A MAN WHO SET FORTH THE MENTALITY OF TREATING CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE AS LESS THAN HUMAN.
