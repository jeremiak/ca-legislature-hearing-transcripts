TEN EIGHTY FOUR WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR ONCE WE HAVE A QUORUM IS ESTABLISHED. IN ORDER TO MOVE THROUGH OUR AGENDA -- IN A QUICK MANNER PLEASE NOTE THAT WE ALLOWED TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. TO WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION BEYOND THESE LIMITS PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME YOUR ORGANIZATION AND POSITION FOR BREVITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WE HAVE -- WE'RE GOING TO ACT AS A SUB COMMITTEE AT THIS POINT SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND START. IN OUR FIRST BILL THIS AFTERNOON IS ITEM NUMBER. FOUR AB FOR EIGHTY FIVE MISTER MEDINA. WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. TODAY I RESENT AB. FOR EIGHTY FIVE AB FOR YOU FIVE SIX TWO IS EXPAND ON CURRENT LAW TO INFORM THE PUBLIC WITH MORE DETAILED INFORMATION. WHEN LOCAL DISTRICTS APPROVED TAXPAYER FUNDED SUBSIDIES FOR WAREHOUSE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS? REACH RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT WAREHOUSES ARE NOT BENEFITING THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT THEY'RE BUILT IN. THE ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE REPORT ENTITLED UNFULFILLED PROMISES. ECONOMIST STATE THAT AMAZON FULFILLMENT CENTERS ARE INEFFECTIVE AND PROVIDING NET JOB GROWTH. SOME OF THE JOBS ARE TEMPORARY SEASONAL. AND FUTURE PLAN FOR AUTOMATION CAUSING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO FLUCTUATE. AND THROWING FAMILIES INTO ECONOMIC INSTABILITY. THIS BILL IS AIMED AT HOLDING THOSE COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PROMISES MADE WHEN SUBSIDIES WERE BEING ASKED. FOR WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS SERRA FLOCKS FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. AND SHERRY OUR HOUSE JEAN FROM THE WAREHOUSE WORKERS RESOURCE CENTER [inaudible] WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THEIR FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND LABOR FEDERATION HAS A LONG HISTORY OF ADVOCATING FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY AND JOB STANDARDS ON PUBLIC SUBSIDIES BOTH AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. AND THIS BILL CONTINUES THAT TRADITION AND ONE OF THE REASONS WE DO THAT IS BECAUSE EVERY DOLLAR THAT GOES OUT IN A LOCAL SUBSIDY TO A BUSINESS. IS A DOLLAR THAT CAN'T BE USED FOR OTHER PRIORITIES LIKE PARKS ROADS SCHOOLS AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SAY WE'RE GOING TO GIVE A TAXPAYER SUBSIDY TO A BUSINESS. THAT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY ARE GETTING A RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT AND TO BE CLEAR THE DISCLOSURE REQUIRED IN THIS BILL. ONLY APPLIES WHEN A WAREHOUSE TAKES A SUBSIDY OF OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. IF THEY DON'T WANT TO DISCLOSE ANY OF THE INFORMATION THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THE LOCAL SUBSIDY -- THEY CAN GET SUBSIDIES IN OTHER PLACES OR JUST LOCATE AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT REALLY SAYS OKAY. WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A SUBSIDY WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF JOBS YOU'RE CREATING WHAT ARE THE QUALITY ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE BENEFITS ARE THE TEMPORARY ARE THEY PART TIME. AND WE WANT TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION IN A PUBLIC MEETING SO THE COMMUNITY WILL KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE THESE MILLION SQUARE FOOT WAREHOUSE IS MOVING IN WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE GETTING. BECAUSE THE LAST THING WE WANT IS FOR LOCAL TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO BE GOING TO A WAREHOUSE THAT BEEN PAYS SO LITTLE THAT WORKERS AND UP ON MEDI CAL OR OTHER PUBLIC BENEFITS BECAUSE THAT IS DOUBLE DIPPING AND IT DOESN'T. IMPROVE THE ECONOMY IN THOSE AREAS. I WANT TO FOCUS ON FOR PARTS OF THIS BILL THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WAS IN THE BILL LAST YEAR THAT THE COMMITTEE HEARD. WHICH I THINK IMPROVE THE BILL ONE IS THAT WE REQUIRING REPORTING ON ANY PLANS FOR AUTOMATION. TO KNOW WHAT JOBS ARE GOING TO BE ELIMINATED WE ARE ALSO SET OUT ASKING FOR REPORTING TO GO BIZ THE STATE AGENCY SO WILL BE EASY FOR US TO SEE. GET A PICTURE OF WHERE SUBSIDIES ARE GOING ACROSS THE STATE WERE ASKING IF THERE IS ANY JUST FOR THIS THE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DISCLOSE IF THERE'S ANY KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY OR CLAW BACK. AND INCLUDED IN THE CONTRACT AND LASTLY THERE IS A BAN ON NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT SIGNED BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE WAREHOUSE -- AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS DURING NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACT PARTLY THAT COMES OUT OF THE FACT THAT AMAZON. WENT THROUGH AND DID A COMPETITION GOT ALL THIS INFORMATION FROM COMMUNITIES AND THEN NO ONE OF THE COMMUNITY WAS ALLOWED TO KNOW WAS IN THE DEAL THEY MADE THEM SIGN NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS WHICH WE THINK IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY. ANTI DEMOCRATIC ANTI TRANSPARENT FOR THAT REASON WE'RE PROUD TO SUPPORT. THANK YOU WELCOME THANK YOU -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SHERRY ARE COST YOU I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE WAREHOUSE WORKER RESOURCE CENTER. WE'RE A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION BASED IN THE INLAND EMPIRE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING WAREHOUSE WORKERS ESPECIALLY LOW WAGE WORKERS WAREHOUSE WORKERS IN THE SECTOR AND THEIR FAMILIES. THROUGH EDUCATION ADVOCACY IN ACTION -- THEM HERE BECAUSE THIS BILL IS SOMETHING THAT WILL. ESPECIALLY BENEFIT OF FOLKS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE REGION BUT ALSO ACROSS INLAND HEALTH SOUTHERN ISLAND CALIFORNIA -- LAST TWENTY YEARS WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION IS BECOME A KEY SECTOR OF THE INLAND CALIFORNIA ECONOMY -- OVER FIVE HER MILLION SQUARE FEET OF WAREHOUSING SPACE THE POINT OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE -- HAVE COME INTO THE INLAND REGION IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THERE'S OVER -- TO FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE ARE EMPLOYED IN WAREHOUSES. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT LEADERS HAVE CLAIMED THAT LOGISTICS THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR JOB GROWTH IN THESE AREAS. AS A RESULT MUNICIPALITIES ARE OFFERING MAJOR TAX INCENTIVES INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER SUBSIDIES TO EMPLOYERS TO SITE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. ACCORDING -- TO ONE SOURCE GOOD JOBS FIRST OVER FOUR POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN SUBSIDIES HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO FREIGHT LOGISTICS COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AT THE SAME TIME THE QUALITY OF THE JOBS CREATED BY THESE FACILITIES IS INCONSISTENT ON CLEAR. RESEARCH BY UCLA INTO THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FOUND THAT OVER HALF THE WAREHOUSE JOBS IN THESE FACILITIES IN ONTARIO. WERE EMPLOYING WORKERS WERE INPUT CLING MAJORITY OF WORKERS THROUGH STAFFING AGENCIES AT OR CLOSE TO MINIMUM WAGE WITH NO BENEFITS. NO CONSISTENCY OR ABILITY TO KNOW IF YOU'LL HAVE WORK THE NEXT DAY A LITTLE ON THE NEXT WEEK. THESE CONDITIONS ARE UNACCEPTABLE. LAST YEAR THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION SUPPORTED BY REGIONAL BUSINESS GROUPS OF UP TO REPORT ON THE REGIONAL ECONOMY IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. I FOUND THAT WHILE WAREHOUSE JOB WHAT WAREHOUSE GROWTH HAS -- DRIVEN EMPLOYMENT GROWTH AND IN THE INLAND EMPIRE FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. IN THAT PERIOD. WAIT WAIT JUST AN EARNINGS OF ACTUALLY DROPPED AND THE POVERTY RATE HAS IT ACTUALLY INCREASED -- FIT FOCUSING OUR REGIONAL ECONOMY ON THIS SECTOR HAS ACTUALLY BEEN DETRIMENTAL SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND BROOKINGS RECOMMENDED TO THE ECONOMIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCY. I COMING TO THAT UP DEVELOPING AGENCIES OF THE REGION THAT THEY STOP FOCUSING AS MUCH ON WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION AND LOOK AT OTHER INDUSTRIES LIKE MANUFACTURING. WE THINK THAT THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR US TO LOOK AT THE WAY HOUSING HAS BEEN BUILT A NEW WAREHOUSE AND IS COMING INTO THIS REGION. AND ASK FOR TRANSPARENCY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE TO BE GOOD JOBS -- THIS BILL IS JUST A SMALL STEP IN THAT DIRECTION TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF JOBS ARE BEING CREATED HOW MANY -- AND WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE MADE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES -- THE CURRENT DISCLOSURE LAWS ARE INADEQUATE AND THAT NUMBER OF NUMBER QUALITY OF JOBS ARE NOT THAT ARE BEING CREATED NOT CLEAR -- WITH SEVERAL INSTANCES IN EXAMPLES OF THAT HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITY -- QVC -- OP OPEN THE WAREHOUSE IN ONTARIO IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THERE IS TO BOTH STATE CALIFORNIA COMPETES BUT ALSO LOCAL SUBSIDIES FROM THE CITY OF ONTARIO -- THE CITY OFFERED FIFTY TO THIS DAY THE COMPANY 55% OF THE TAX REVENUE TO BE RETURNED TO THE COMPANY -- THEY TOLD THE STATE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE OVER NINE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES BY NOW BUT I DRIVE BY THAT FACILITY ALMOST EVERY DAY ON THE WAY TO WORK. AND THERE'S NEVER MORE THAN FIFTY OR SIXTY CARS IN THE PARKING LOT -- TO ISSUE MERCHANT HOME SHOPPING NETWORK LAST YEAR HOME SHOPPING WHAT NETWORK RECEIVED -- SIMILAR TAX ABATEMENT FROM THE CITY OF FONTANA RIGHT NEXT DOOR 50% OF THE TAX -- BIZRATE RETURNED IN FONTANA TO HOME SHOPPING NETWORK NOW THAT SAME COMPANY THAT NOW MERGED COMPANY IS OFFERING TO FACILITIES -- WITH THESE TAX ABATEMENTS BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW MANY JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED AND WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE TO THE COMMUNITY. AND FINALLY AMAZON ONE OF THE RICHEST COMPANIES OF THE WORLD IS PLAYING THIS GAME. AFTER RECEIVING SIGNIFICANT STATE TAX INCENTIVES IN TWENTY TWELVE TO OPEN IN SEVERAL FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE -- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THEY RECEIVED -- ABATEMENTS FOR THE CITY OF FRESNO FOR UP TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. WINNERS IN THE CITY OF FRESNO SUPPOSED TO THIS BILL AND WE ASK WHY WHY ARE WE ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR IS TRANSPARENCY ABOUT. THE SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. RESCUE FOR INFORMATION ABOUT PLAN FOR GROWTH GROWTH. IN INCLUDING AUTOMATION US SOME THAT'S COMING REALLY QUICKLY IN THE SECTOR. WE'RE ASKING WHY CITIES NEED TO HOLD NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS WITH DEVELOPERS WAREHOUSE OPERATORS ABOUT THESE KEEP WORKING CONDITIONS FOR THE SECTOR -- THANK YOU.

UNPRECEDENTED SUCCESS WITH THREE AECOM ARE CENTERS -- COMING TO OUR REGION THESE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE HELP CHIP AWAY AT AWAY AT THE GENERATIONAL POVERTY THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED -- WENDY AND WE HAVE AT LEAST FOUR THOUSAND ESTIMATED NEW JOBS BECAUSE OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS.

THE BILL REMAINS ON CALL THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXTEL. NINE FORTY FIVE YES YOU MAY BEGIN. YEAH FOR ME AND MY WITNESSES APPEAR [inaudible] YEAH. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR HER TO PRESENT AB NINE FORTY FIVE AM ENSURE IT WHICH WOULD ALLOW LOCAL AGENCIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THEIR SURPLUS FUNDS THAT THEY MAY INVEST IN SECURE FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS CALLED RECIPROCAL DEPOSITS. THIS BILL DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT AGENCIES DO THAT BUT IT WOULD BE PERMISSIVE IF IT MAKES FINANCIAL SENSE FOR THAT AGENCY A CURRENT LAW PLACES MANY RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE INVESTMENT OF SURPLUS FUNDS. FROM LOCAL LOCAL AGENCIES MAY INVEST IN THOSE RESTRICTIONS INCLUDE ENSURING THE INVESTMENTS MUST BE MUST HAVE HIGH LIQUIDITY AND DO NOT POSE A HIGHER RISK TO THE LOCAL AGENCY. THE BILL DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF THESE RESTRICTIONS IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS BUT DOES INCREASE THE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE USED FROM AGENCIES SURPLUS FROM 20%. TO FIFTY A CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION WHICH HAS SUCH A CAP ON THESE RECIPROCAL DEPOSITS. WE ARE SANDERS A NEED FOR CAUTION BUT THIS IS A SMART MEASURE WHICH ALLOWS OUR LOCALS. TO INVEST WITH COMMUNITY BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS INSTITUTIONS ARE GOOD EMPLOYERS GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITIES PROVIDE FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITIES TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE OFTEN TURNED AWAY FROM THE BIG BANKS. INCREASING THE CAP WILL MEAN THAT THESE CUTS COMMUNITY BANKS WILL HAVE MORE ABILITY TO GIVE OUT CREDIT FOR THINGS LIKE SMALL BUSINESS LOANS. THIS WILL HAVE A DIRECT MULTIPLIER EFFECT ON OUR LOCAL ECONOMIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WITH ME ARE TO A LOCAL ENTITIES -- WORKING ON BANKING ISSUES FOR MANY YEARS FOR THE SACRAMENTO AREA STEPHEN FLEMING CO RIVER CITY BANK AND JAMES BECKWITH. EXECUTIVE VP FIVE STAR BANK. OKAY GO AHEAD WITNESSES AND SPARKLE AT OB THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON JAMES BACK WITH THEM ACTUALLY THE PRESIDENT AND CEO FIVE STAR BANK. NO WORRIES THEM SOME WOMEN BOB I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THAT I WANTED -- TO EXPRESS -- MIGHT USE ABOUT THIS IF I COULD -- THIS BILL ALLOWS SO IT WILL ALLOW FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY ON BEHALF OF THOSE -- TREASURES MUNICIPAL OFFICERS IN TERMS OF UTILIZING RECIPROCAL DEPOSITS. CURRENTLY BOB SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND MUNICIPALITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO COLLATERALIZED. PUBLIC DEPOSITS WHICH IS A REQUIREMENT BY LAW WITH THREE DISTINCT COLLATERAL SOURCES MIND THAT'S MUCH SECURITIES QUALIFIED INVESTMENT SECURITIES. LETTER CREDIT FROM FHL BE OF SAN FRANCISCO AND RECIPROCAL DEPOSITS. WE THANK OUR BY ALLOWING AN INCREASE BOB FROM THIRTY TO FIFTY IN REMOVING THE SUNSET WHICH THIS BILL -- REQUIRES IS A VERY GOOD THING FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO FOLKS IN THE CAPITAL REGION -- BODY YEAR AGO STEVEN I PUT TOGETHER A PROGRAM CALLED RISE RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENTS FOR A STRONG ECONOMY. SIMPLY IT WORKS LIKE THIS WE TAKE MUNICIPAL DEPOSITS OR TO SPECIAL DISTRICT DEPOSITS ARE COUNTY DEPOSITS. IN COLLATERALIZED THEM. UNDER THE THREE METHODS WHICH I JUST SHARED WITH YOU. AND WE AGREED TO TURN AROUND AND LEND THOSE MONEYS BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. TO DATE WE HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THOSE TYPES OF DEPOSITS IN IN OUR INSTITUTIONS AND WE PLAN TO OUT ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION BACK INTO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. SO WE BELIEVE. THAT THIS INCREASE IN ALLOWING A GREATER USE OF RECIPROCAL DEPOSITS. WILL ALLOW FOR GREATER USE OF OF LOCAL DEPOSITS PLACED IN LOCAL COMMUNITY BANKS. THIS IS NOT A REQUIREMENT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DISCRETIONARY ON BEHALF OF THE THE TREASURES IN THE NESTLE PAUL OFFICERS THEY CAN UTILIZE ANY -- THREE COLLATERAL PULLS IF YOU WILL. AND WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD POLICY FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- THANKS JAMES AND THANKS TO THE COMMITTEE FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY -- AS IN THE KID I'M STEVE FLEMING PRESIDENT RIVER CITY BANK BASED HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AB NINE FORTY FIVE IS IMPORTANT TO US I'LL BE AT WE ALL AT LEAST -- WEEK WE ON THE BANKING SIDE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE IT'S A BIT OF A A NERDY GEEKY -- BANKING KIND OF KIND OF BILL -- BUT STILL NEVER LESS IMPORTANT TO US -- RIVER CITY BANK. IN -- NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE WE'RE THE LARGEST BANK IN IN SACRAMENTO -- BUT WERE RELATIVELY SMALL COMPARED TO THE NAME BRAND NATIONAL BANKS THAT JUST YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH. WHERE WESTERNERS A COMMUNITY BANK JUST LIKE FIVE STAR BANK -- WHICH MEANS THAT WE HAVE A A NEAR OR GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS FOR OUR OUR TARGET CUSTOMERS THEN THE THE LARGEST BANKS IN OUR CASE IT HAPPENS TO BE CUSTOMERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. PUBLIC SECTOR ENTITIES ARE IMPORTANT. FOR US IN TERMS OF OUR TARGET MARKET -- WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN JUST LAST YEAR THE CITY DAVIS I MADE A DECISION -- TO MOVE THEIR BANKING RELATIONSHIP TO RIVER CITY BANK FROM ONE OF THE NATIONAL BANKS WHOSE NAME YOU YOU YOU WILL SEE ON THE NEWS QUITE OFTEN -- PROPS MORE IMPORTANT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE THE THE BANK -- THE LEADING BANK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR ENTITIES CREATED UNDER THE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION LEGISLATION. WE BANK FIFTEEN OF THE TWENTY CC ENTITIES ACROSS THE STATE WHOSE MANDATE REALLY IS TO DELIVER A HIGHER CONTENT TO OF CLEAN ENERGY -- FOR US WHICH WE WE ALL KNOW IS IMPORTANT AND ALSO -- REDUCE PRICES FOR FOR RATEPAYERS SO WE'RE PROUD OF OUR ASSOCIATION WITH THOSE PUBLIC SECTOR ENTITIES. AB NINE FORTY FIVE IS -- IS A GOOD DEAL FOR OUR PUBLIC SECTOR IN THERE FOR PUBLIC POLICY -- AND IT'S A GOOD DEAL FOR OUR BANKS IT'S A GOOD DEAL FOR THE PUBLIC SECTOR -- BECAUSE WE CAN PAY A HIGHER RATE OF INTEREST ON THOSE DEPOSITS -- WHICH OF COURSE ARE OUR CUSTOMERS APPRECIATE THOSE DEPOSITS IS JAMES NOTED CAN BE MAINTAINED AND LIQUID ACCOUNTS -- SO THE TREASURES HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THE LIQUIDITY OF THEIR INVESTMENTS -- THEY ALSO ARE THERE'S NO SAFETY ISSUES THERE -- AND IT ALLOWS US TO LEND MORE MONEY OUT -- WITHOUT HAVING TO COLLATERALIZED THOSE DEPOSITS WE HAVE MORE ABILITY TO LEND NINETY INTO OUR COMMUNITIES WHICH PROMOTES ECONOMIC GROWTH. AND JOB CREATION SO FOR THOSE REASONS -- WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI NINE FORTY FIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS KEVIN GOLD WITH THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE THE SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE. THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING UP FOR IN THE COMMITTEE FOR SPENDING TIME CONSIDERING THIS MEASURE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. ARTICLE THAT'S THE NUMBER OF HAVE THE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BANKING NETWORK WE ALSO THINK ALSO BRINGS FORWARD AND ASKED FOR AYE VOTE. ROBERT WILSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. OKAY THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER TERRY MEMBERS KAREN LAYING OFF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURER'S AND TAX COLLECTORS. TO BE CLEAR THE COUNTY TREASURER'S. HAVE NOT ASKED FOR THIS LEGISLATION AND THEY DID NOT FIND THAT THE CAP NEEDS TO BE RAISED NONE OF THEIR MEMBERS ARE COMPLAINING THAT THE 30% CAP. IS RESTRICTING THEIR ABILITY TO INVEST WITH THESE BANKS. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT TYING UP WITH THE SURPLUS FUNDS BEING HALF ABOUT HALF ON A DAILY BASIS OF THE SCHOOLS DOLLARS IN AN INSTRUMENT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE LIKE WITH THE THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT TYPES THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS WITH ALLOWING THAT INSTRUMENT AT WHAT'S CONSIDERED SURPLUS MAY ACTUALLY BE. CAPITAL DOLLARS FIRST SCHOOLS CONSTRUCTION PROJECT AND THEY'RE JUST THE BILLS ARE DUE YET SO. IF A BILL IS DUE AND THOSE FUNDS ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE IN THE PUTS PRESSURE ON OTHER POOL PARTICIPANTS AS IDENTIFIED IN THE ANALYSIS. SO WE'RE FINE WITH ELIMINATING THE SUNSET. BUT AGAIN THIS IS THE COUNTY TREASURER'S WHO ARE THE TARGET OF THIS BILL ARE NOT IDENTIFYING A PROBLEM WITH THE CURRENT CAP. THAT THE RESTRICTIONS ON A LOT EXIST BECAUSE ORANGE COUNTY WENT BANKRUPT AND WE ARE REQUIRED TO ABIDE BY IT VERY SPECIFIC INVESTMENT CRITERIA WE NEED TO SPREAD THE RISK WE SHOULD NOT BE CONCENTRATING IT AND WE DON'T REALLY SEE HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH. THE LAW AS IT RELATES TO SPREADING THE RISK. OF BY PUTTING 50% OF THE POLLING ONE THING SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED TO REMOVE THE CAP FOR FOR WITH EVERY MOVE THAT I'D DEADLINE FOR THE SUNSET WERE FINE WITH THAT. ON THE PROGRAM SEEMS TO BE WORKING BUT AGAIN THERE'S NO DEMAND FOR THIS INCREASE AND WE VIEW IT AS BEING CONSISTENT WITH OTHER PARTS OF THEIR STATUTORY MANDATE SO WITH THAT WE ASK FOR YOUR PUT THEM WITH AMENDED -- MOTION THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. QUESTION TO THE COMMITTEE GOOD. TO THE LAST WITNESS NOW. WHEN I WAS MAYOR OF THE CITY? OUR CITY AND I'VE ALSO OBSERVE THE COUNTIES COULD PICK. MANY DIFFERENT -- FUNDS TO BE. STASH THEIR MONEY. SOME ARE MORE LIKE MONEY MARKET FUNDS OTHERS ARE LIKE THIS. SO. I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT YOUR CONCERN IS WHEN YOU HAVE FREEDOM OF CHOICE OVER SO MANY DIFFERENT INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES OR JUST SIMPLY TRYING TO PRESERVE YOUR CAPITAL. AT THE THE PROMISE OF THE MEASURE IS 50% IN ONE OF ANYTHING THERE'S I CAN PROMISE YOU THERE'S NOT 50% OF THE COUNTY TREASURY. AND ANY OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES INVESTED IN ONE THING AND 30% SEEMS. A PRETTY HEALTHY NUMBER OF THIS THAT THE SURPLUS DOLLARS 50% COULD GET INTO YOU COULD GET INTO REAL TROUBLE. AND BECOME ILLIQUID UNDER THE CITY REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE RELATED. TO AFTER ORANGE COUNTY WENT BANKRUPT IT'S SAFETY FIRST THE RETURN OF PRINCIPLE NOT RETURN ON PRINCIPLE. AND THEN LIQUIDITY AND THEN YOU'LL NOT BE THE THIRD THING YOU CONSIDER BUT LIQUIDITY MUST BE READILY AVAILABLE AND THE 50% OF THE DOLLARS ARE INVESTED IN ONE THING. IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT -- TO TO ACCESS IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE INSTRUMENT IS. MR TERROR THE FORCE TO COME AS PLEASE. SO MY COMMENT TO THAT IS THEY ALL THE ENTITIES HAVE A WIDE VARIETY WHERE THEY WANT TO PUT THEIR MONEY AND FREEDOM OF CHOICE. SO. JUST BECAUSE IT'S 50% IN ONE FUND. HEY MAYBE YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT. YOUR MONEY IN THAT ONE FUN. BUT YOU HAVE A MUCH WIDER CHOICE IN ALL SORTS OF OTHER FUNDS WHICH I PERSONALLY WOULD FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH A FIVE AS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR OR ANY OTHER LEADER MAKING THOSE DECISIONS -- SO THAT'S MY COMMENT TO YOU TO THE AUTHOR -- I THINK THIS IS A WONDERFUL BILL. AND I THINK IT HELPS BRING CALIFORNIA UP. TO THE LEVELS INTERESTS UNITED STATES [inaudible] END NEXT. SESSION I WOULD LIKE TO SEE 75% THANK YOU [inaudible] BABY STEPS [inaudible] OKAY. NO THE QUESTIONS. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO ANNOUNCE TO THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO BE. ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR EVEN THOUGH SHE'S NOT HERE YES. OKAY YOU RECALLS. YES THANK YOU IT AND MAYBE MISTER VOEPEL LIKE TO BE A CO AUTHOR AS WELL AWESOME AND YES SIR OF YEAH RESERVE. YES AND AGAIN I I APPRECIATE THE THE CONCERN BUT THIS IS -- PERMISSIVE AS WE STATE IN THE END THERE ARE NUMBER OF RESTRICTIONS ARE IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THESE ARE A RISKY INVESTMENTS I THINK THIS IS A A REASONED RESPONSE IN ADDITION. TO EXTEND THE SUNSET TO MODERNIZE THIS POLICY TO PUT US IN LINE WITH OTHER STATES THROUGHOUT THE NATION ASK YOUR EYE THANK YOU. VERY GOOD SECRETARY WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

CURRENT LAW PREVENTS SINGLE FAMILY LOTS FROM BEING SUBDIVIDED HABITAT FOR HUMANITY MONTEREY BAY HAS WORKED WITH THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE TO BUILD EIGHTY USE THAT ARE OWNER OCCUPIED.

FAMILIES A WE'VE GOT A LOT OF A SINGLE AND AND TO CARRY IT -- TO TO HOME A TWO PERSON HOUSEHOLDS NOW THAT CAN'T BE SERVED WITH THE THREE OR FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE ANYMORE.

ACTUALLY HAVE A TRACK RECORD ALREADY OF EIGHT HOMES -- THREE OF THEM HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN SOLD BACK TO HABITAT WE FIX THEM UP AND SOLD THEM TO NEW FAMILIES -- WHAT'S NICE ABOUT THE PROGRAM IS IT OFFERS PERMANENT AFFORDABILITY FOR THOSE HOMES NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES THEY TRANSFER BACK AND FORTH -- SO HOW BOTH FOR OUR COUNTY AND FOR BUTTE COUNTY NOW WE HAVE SITES AVAILABLE TO DO THIS AGAIN AND WE'D LIKE TO HAVE. A WITH THIS BILL IN PLACE THAT WILL ALLOW US TO TO BUILD SOME EXCESS REBELLING UNITS I THINK ACROSS THE THE COUNTRY OR ACROSS THE STATE NOW -- LOCAL AND STATE ORDINANCES ARE ENCOURAGING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TO USE AND THIS WILL OPEN THE DOOR FOR SOME OF THOSE UNITS TO BE -- PERMANENTLY AFFORDABLE WITH HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU.

UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SOME BARRIERS TO EIGHTY YOU CONSTRUCTION THAT STILL REMAIN AND A. B. EIGHT EIGHT ONE SIX REDUCE THOSE BY. UPDATING AND CLARIFYING THE STATUTE THEM. THE MEASURE DOES A FEW THINGS FIRST IT CLARIFIES SEVERAL DEFINITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING THE DEFINITION OF PUBLIC TRANSIT. AND EIGHTY IS DISTANCE FROM TRANSIT ON THE TYPES OF EXISTING STRUCTURES THE CAN BE CONVERTED TO EIGHTY YEARS. SECONDLY IT REMOVES PROVISIONS THAT HAVE GIVEN CITIES. SOME -- A REASONABLY BROAD DISCRETION FOR DENYING EIGHTY YOU PERMITS AND FINALLY IT REMOVES THE OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT A IN THE EXISTING STATUTE WHICH SUBJECTS EIGHTY YEARS TO REQUIREMENT THAT IS NOT EXIST FOR ANY OTHER. KIND OF HOUSING AND COULD RESULT IN EIGHTY IS BEING DEMOLISHED. THAT CREATES A LONG TERM UNCERTAINTY AROUND A UNITS FUTURE AFTER IT HAS BEEN BUILT. THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AT A FIVE YEAR SUNSET TO OWNER OCCUPANCY PROVISIONS SET.

THE PROPERTY TAX WELL FOR EXEMPTION HELPS REDUCE THE ANNUAL OPERATING COSTS OF LOW INCOME HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS AND IS CRUCIAL TO ENSURING THE FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY. OF LOW INCOME HOUSING. BUT THE EXEMPTION DOES NOT INCLUDE THE BELARUS SPECIAL TAX WHICH CAN BE AS MUCH AS A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT PER YEAR. CALIFORNIANS NEED ONE POINT FOUR MILLION MORE AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOMES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF LOW INCOME. HOUSEHOLDS AND RENTERS NEED TO EARN THREE AND A HALF TIMES THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE TO AFFORD THE AVERAGE MONTHLY RENT.

ELEVEN HUNDRED WELCOME WELCOME HOW ARE YOU. FIFTEEN STILL STANDING. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM HERE ON THIS WEDNESDAY PRESENTING AB ELEVEN HUNDRED WHICH WILL ALIGN THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE. WITH LOCAL PARKING ORDINANCES TO SUPPORT ELECTRIC VEHICLE. CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. WHEN AN EEVEE CHARGING STATION IS INSTALLED AT A PARKING SPACE THE BUILDING CODE DEFINES EXPLICITLY? IT IS A CHARGING SPOT AND NO LONGER A PARKING SPOT. THE BUILDING CODE ALSO REQUIRES THAT ONE OF THE FIRST FOUR CHARGERS INSTALLED IN A LOT TO BE INSTALLED IN A VAN ACCESSIBLE SIZE SPACE. WHICH PHYSICALLY REQUIRES COMBINING TO NORMAL SIZE SPOTS. THESE REQUIREMENTS RESULT IN MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REQUIRING EVEY CHARGING COMPANIES TO CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PARKING SPACES TO OFFSET THE LOST PARKING SPACE. TO MEET LOCAL PARKING REQUIREMENTS. BUILDING AN ADDITIONAL PARKING SPACES OFTEN COSTLY OR TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE CAUSING CHARGING PROJECTS TO BE DROPPED ENTIRELY. SUCH TECHNICAL ISSUES CREATE ARBITRARY BARRIERS TO STATION DEPLOYMENT WHICH IS INCONSISTENT WITH OUR LONG TERM CLIMATE GOALS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SOMEONE IS A POWER THESE INCLUDING SO NO MIND SACRAMENTO COUNTIES AND THE CITIES OF STOCKTON AND LOS ANGELES TO NAME A FEW. HAVE RECOGNIZE THESE ISSUES AND HAVE PASSED ORDINANCES TO FIX SOME OF THEM. HOWEVER MOST OTHER MUNICIPALITIES HAVE NOT TAKEN SUCH MEASURES. WE NEED TO HELP COMMUNITIES ACCESS THIS IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY TO INCREASE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN E. VIS. A. B. ELEVEN HUNDRED HELPS ACHIEVE THIS BY CLARIFYING THAT PARKING STALLS WITH EVEY CHARGING STATIONS CAN STILL COUNT TOWARDS PARKING REQUIREMENTS AND WOULD ALSO ALLOW VAN ACCESSIBLE EVEY SPACES TO COUNT AS TWO SPARKING PARKING SPACES. FOR PURPOSES OF COMPLYING WITH PARKING REQUIREMENTS. TODAY WITH ME AND SUPPORT IS COREY BOLAS WITH THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING ASSOCIATION WELCOME CURRENT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS CORBELS WITH THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING ASSOCIATION -- WE ARE COMPRISED OF LEADING COMPANIES THAT DESIGN MANUFACTURE INSTALL AND OPERATE -- EVEY CHARGING EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES MOST OF OUR COMPANIES ARE HEADQUARTERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- SO THE STATE HAS VERY AMBITIOUS EVEY DEPLOYMENT GOALS OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION BY -- TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FIVE MILLION BY TWENTY THIRTY BUT ALSO AN AMBITIOUS EVEY CHARGING DEPLOYMENT GOAL OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PUBLIC CHARGERS BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY EMBRACE THOSE GOALS -- BUT IT IS ALSO GOING TO MEAN THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO INCREASINGLY FOCUS ON REDUCING BARRIERS TO DEPLOYMENT. AND THE ISSUES LAID OUT BY THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARE REALLY HUGE ONES FOR US IN TERMS OF INSTALLING PROJECTS. AND WE LOSE SCORES OF PROJECTS EVERY YEAR TO THESE TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT SHE'S TOUCHED ON AND JUST BECAUSE OF THE ADDED COSTS BY BUILDING ANOTHER PARKING SPACE OR IT'S BECAUSE IT'S OFTENTIMES TECHNICALLY IN FEASIBLE WE WE WE JUST CAN'T DO IT BASED ON HOW THE SPACE IS BUILT OUT -- AND IN THE CASE OF DEFINING A PARKING STALL AS A CHARGING STALL AND THE CAR IS STILL PARKED WALL YOU'RE CHARGING SO THE PARKING SPOT AS WE KNOW IT ISN'T LOST IT IS STILL THERE -- IN THIS IS NOT A UNIQUE ISSUE IN ANY ONE CITY OR COUNTY IT'S WHERE EXPERIENCE IT EXPERIENCING IT ACROSS THE STATE -- IN MANY PLACES AND WHILE I'M A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS HAVE TAKEN ACTION TO FIX THOSE TECHNICAL ISSUES THOSE ARE IN THE MINORITY -- AS THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS POINTED OUT -- SO THE END RESULT IS WE MISS OUT ON TONS OF PRIME LOCATIONS TO INSTALL CHARGERS AND THAT'S JUST. NOT HELPFUL AS IT RELATES TO OUR DEPLOYMENT GOALS SO -- THIS BILL WILL FIX THOSE ISSUES AND HELP TAKE THIS A STEP FORWARD IN THAT DIRECTION SO WE RESPECTFULLY OR DRIVE OUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

BOERNER HORVATH I RAMOS. THREE OF US THREE OF US FIVE ROBERT RIVAS. ROBERT RIVERSIDE VOEPEL. VOEPEL HI. BILLS AT SEVEN ZERO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU RE TRIP UP HERE -- NEXT WE WILL HAVE ITEM NUMBER SEVENTEEN AB FIFTEEN FIFTY ONE ASSEMBLYMEMBER DAILY WELCOME. WITH THE STATE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS BILL PROPOSES TO CHANGES TO THE PROPERTY ASSESSED CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAM WHICH IS ALSO KNOWN AS PACE IT REQUIRES PACE ADMINISTRATORS TO PROVIDE PROPERTY OWNERS WITH A ONE PAGE DISCLOSURE FORM. PRIOR TO ENTERING INTO A CONTRACT THE FORMAL CONTAIN BASIC AND IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INFORMATION. SECONDLY THIS BILL PROVIDED PROHIBITS PACE ADMINISTRATORS FROM CHARGING PROPERTY OWNERS A PREPAYMENT PENALTY. THE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISHED PACE PROGRAM BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WE'VE MADE A NUMBER OF IMPROVEMENTS IN FINE TUNINGS TO PACE OVER THE YEARS. THIS BILL BUILDS UPON PREVIOUS LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS TO PROPERTY OWNERS CONSIDERING A PACE AGREEMENT. WITH ME TODAY IS ANNA BUCK REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. WELCOME THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ANNA BACK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS AB FIFTEEN FIFTY ONE DOES TWO THINGS ELIMINATES THE ABILITY OF A PACE ADMINISTRATOR COMPANY -- TO CHARGE A PREPAYMENT PENALTY AND IT ADDS AN ADDITIONAL HARD COPY CONSUMER FRIENDLY DISCLOSURE THAT MUST BE SIGNED BY A CONSUMER PRIOR TO AGREEING TO FINANCING -- AS YOU ALREADY KNOW PACE IS A UNIQUE FORM OF FINANCING SANCTIONED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ALLOWS PROPERTY OWNERS TO FINANCE WATER AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. AND NOW HOME HARDENING EFFORTS -- WITH A FEW NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS FINANCINGS MINISTERED -- BY FOR PROFIT PRIVATE ENTERPRISE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS DUE TO NUMEROUS CONCERNS WITH THE INDUSTRY'S MARKETING AND DISCLOSURE PRACTICES. PAGE WAS BROUGHT TO THE LEGISLATURE'S ATTENTION CA ARE HAS CO SPONSORED OR SUPPORTED. NUMEROUS PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF BRINGING THE INDUSTRY UNDER REGULATORY CONTROL OF THE TV -- AND HAS BROUGHT MANY CONSUMER PROTECTION PROTECTIONS TO THE INDUSTRY INCLUDING AN ABILITY TO PAY ANALYSIS WHICH DID NOT PREVIOUSLY EXIST. HOWEVER AN INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST STILL EXISTS WITHIN THE PACE PROGRAM STRUCTURE BECAUSE PASTE ADMINISTRATOR COMPANIES RELY ON CONTRACTORS WHO WILL BE INSTALLING THE PRODUCTS. TO SIGN CUSTOMERS UP FOR THE FINANCING. THE FINANCING IS REPAID THROUGH A LINE ITEM ON THE PROPERTY TAX BILL INCREASE SUPER PRIORITY LEAVE ON THE IMPROVE PROPERTY. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THESE PRODUCTS RESULT IN A SECURED DEBT AND THAT'S HAVE VERY LITTLE RISK TO THE LENDER THE INTEREST RATES ARE HIGH AT SIX AND A HALF TO EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT. ADDITIONALLY SOME ADMINISTRATOR COMPANIES CHARGE FEES AND PREPAYMENT PENALTIES WHEN A HOMEOWNER DECIDES TO PAY OFF THEIR PACE LEAN. BECAUSE FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC WILL NOT PURCHASE A MORTGAGE THAT HAS A HIGHER LEAN PRIORITY THEN THERE'S PAYS ASSESSMENTS MUST BE PAID OFF PRIOR TO THE SALE OR REFINANCE OF THE PROPERTY. AND ADDITIONAL PREPAYMENT PENALTY ONLY SERVE TO A ROAD HARDER INEQUITY IN THE PROPERTY AND WE BELIEVE IT'S POOR PUBLIC POLICY TO ADD EXTRA FEES AND PENALTIES TO A GOVERNMENT ENDORSED FINANCING PROGRAM. MEANT TO SERVE THE PURPOSE OF PROMOTING ENERGY EFFICIENCY. THE BILL ALSO CREATES A CONSUMER FRIENDLY EASY TO READ DISCLOSURE THAT STATES IN AND RESTATES ESSENTIAL TERMS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS. ALL CAPS IS USE THAT TIME IN THE DISCLOSURE THING A VERY IMPORTANT TERMS. BECAUSE HOMEOWNERS HAVE A RIGHT TO BE FULLY INFORMED OF ALL THE RELEVANT FACTS OF THIS FINANCING ESPECIALLY SINCE THEIR INCOME BRING. THEIR VERY MOST IMPORTANT ASSET THEIR HOME -- WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO THE INDUSTRY GROUPS AND ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH THEM ON THE TERMINOLOGY IN THE DISCLOSURE HOWEVER WE DO SEE THIS DISCLOSURE AS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE BILL -- FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. CNN ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHRIS ROGERS UP WITH WHITE GREEN ENERGY FUND WHY GREEN IS THE LARGEST PACE PROVIDER IN THE NATION -- BASED OUT OF BEAUTIFUL CINEMA COUNTY. WE AS YOU HEARD -- HAVE A BILL IN FRONT OF US THAT HAS FUNDAMENTALLY TO DIFFERENT PARTS THE FIRST PART IS THE PREPAYMENT PENALTY IN THE DISCLOSURE IN OUR CONFIRM TERMS PHONE CALL. OF THAT PREPAYMENT PENALTY OUT WIDE GREEN ENERGY FUND HAS MATURED AND HAS ACTUALLY ELIMINATED OUR PREPAYMENT PENALTY AND THAT'S BECOME THE INDUSTRY STANDARD WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT PORTION OF THE BILL. THE SECOND ASPECT OF THE BILL IS THE DID THE DISCLOSURE FORM THAT IS PROVIDED TO THE HOMEOWNER IN THE BEGINNING -- AS YOU WILL SEE FROM THE THE CHART THAT I PASSED OUT YOUR STAFF ALSO HAVE RECEIVED THIS CHART WE'RE HAPPY TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE. NOT ONLY IS THE DISCLOSURE FORM REDUNDANT WITH THE EXISTING DISCLOSURE FORM IT WOULD BE REDUNDANT WITH THE PROPOSED SECONDARY DISCLOSURE FORM THAT IS BEING PROPOSED BY THE CSL BEYOND SOLAR PROJECTS. IT IS ADDITIONALLY REDUNDANT WITH OUR CONFIRM TERMS PHONE CALL -- IF YOU WILL PERMIT ME FOR A MOMENT IF YOU WERE TO USE A PACE ASSESSMENT TODAY NOT ONLY DO YOU NOW HAVE THANKS TO THIS COMMITTEE AND THE GREAT WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS pREGULATING THE ADVERTISING THE CONTRACTOR TRAINING DISPUTES AND AS WELL AS THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. BUT IF YOU WERE TO HAVE A HOMEOWNER I HAVE A CONTRACTOR PROPOSE -- CHANGES HERE HOME FOR ENERGY PURPOSES. THEY WOULD THEN HAND OFF NOT FROM THE CONTRACTOR BUT TO A PACE ADMINISTRATOR WHERE IT'S SIX BAILABLE A TO A PACE COMPANIES TO TALK WITH SOMEBODY ABOUT THE FINANCING. YOU WOULD GET A DISCLOSURE FORM THAT CONTAINS EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF THIS SECONDARY DISCLOSURE FORM AS YOU CAN SEE IN STATUTE ALREADY -- YOU WOULD -- AT THAT POINT BE ABLE TO GET A COPY OF THE CONTRACT THAT'S BEING PROPOSED. YOU WOULD THEN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO NOT SIGN IT THERE TAKE IT ACT TALK WITH OTHER FOLKS ABOUT IT COME BACK. WHEN YOU DECIDED THAT IT WAS RIGHT FOR YOU TO UTILIZE PACE FINANCING TO MAKE CHANGES TO YOUR HOME YOU COULD SIGNED THAT CONTRACT? AS SOON AS YOU SIGNED THAT CONTRACT TO COME SO PACE ADMINISTRATOR WHO VERIFIES NOT ONLY THAT THE IMPROVEMENTS ARE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF OF THE PACE INDUSTRY. THAT IT IS NOT OVER PRICING FOR WHAT WE TYPICALLY SEE FOR THOSE EIGHT MAKE SURE THAT YOU SPEAK THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE -- THAT THE CONTRACT IS IN -- SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE TERMS IT MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY IT ACTUALLY LOOKS AT THAT THE PAGE PROVIDER LOOKS AT YOUR DEBTS VERSES IN YOUR OBLIGATIONS VERSUS YOUR INCOME. IT LOOKS AT WHETHER YOU HAVE ANOTHER PACE ASSESSMENT THAT LOOKS AT THE HISTORY OF YOUR PROPERTY. I IT. GOES THROUGH AND IT MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE -- DELINQUENT -- TAXES IT MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE PROPER UNDERWRITING CRITERIA. ONCE ALL OF THAT IS DETERMINED WE DO A CONFIRM TERMS PHONE CALL. WHERE WE STILL CALL YOU BACK WE WALKED BACK THROUGH WITH YOU THOSE SAME DISCLOSURES MAKING SURE YOU KNOW YOUR OBLIGATION MONTHLY? MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THAT YOU STAFF AN IMPOUND ACCOUNT. IT MAKE SURE AGAIN THAT YOU SPEAK THE LANGUAGE THAT THE CONTRACT IS IN -- SO THAT WE KNOW FOR SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WE ASK AT THE END OF THE PHONE CALL DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE OBLIGATION THAT YOU'RE TAKING ON BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED. IF YOU SAY YES YOU THEN HAVE THREE MORE DAYS OF THREE DAY RIGHT TO CANCEL FOR YOU CAN CANCEL WITH NO PENALTY. THAT'S NOT WHERE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND IN THE PACE INDUSTRY IF THE CONTRACTOR THEN WOULD DO THE WORK ON THE HOME. IF THERE IS AN ISSUE IF THERE IS A WORKMANSHIP ISSU OR IF THE WORK IS NOT ACTUALLY BEEN DONE WE DON'T PAY THE CONTRACTOR UNTIL YOU IS THE HOMEOWNER SIGN OFF. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WORK IS DONE ADEQUATELY -- THERE ARE OTHER EXISTING -- PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN LAW SUCH AS TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTORS THERE'S A WHOLE PROCESS TO KICK OUT NEGATIVE -- CONTRACTORS FROM THE PROGRAM NOT JUST FROM ONE PROVIDER BUT ACROSS THE INDUSTRY THE D. B. L. HAS OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT SO JUST THE CSL BE -- AND I APOLOGIZE THIS IS GOING ON SO LONG IT TAKES EVEN LONGER TO DO ALL THESE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAN TO LIST THEM -- IT SO I WILL POTS THEY'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AS I SAID WHY GREEN AS OPPOSED TO LESS AMENDED. IF THE REDUNDANT FORM WAS REMOVED FROM THE PROCESS WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT ADDS ANY VALUE IT DOESN'T ADD FOR CONSUMERS UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE PREPAYMENT. PAYMENT -- BàN WITHIN THE BILL -- BUT AS IT EXISTS WE ASK FOR A NO VOTE UNLESS AMENDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OF WITNESSES OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE YES. I HAVE A QUESTION -- IF THE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR IS REQUIRED TO ALSO HAVE. OR PROVIDE THESE DISCLOSURES -- IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES SUCH AS SPANISH. IF THAT'S PART OF YOU THAT THAT YES IT IS -- IT IS THE IN RECALL IT'S IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL AND STATE LAW. OKAY THANK YOU AND AND AGAIN IF -- THE CONTRACT WAS IN ENGLISH AND THAT ARE CONFIRMED TERMS PHONE CALL. REACHES THE HOMEOWNER IN THEIR SPEAKING SPANISH AS THEIR PRIMARY LANGUAGE WE WOULD FLAG THAT MAKE SURE THAT THEY GOT AN ACTUAL COPY IN SPANISH OF THE CONTRACT AND WALKING THROUGH IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND. OKAY THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS READY -- I NEED AN ENTERTAINING MOTION REMOTE SHOULD GET. SO THE FACT. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. I'M WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT WITH PLEASURE THAT WHY GREEN.

AB FORTY SIX ARE SURPLUS LAND BILL FIRST FOR ME TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF IN THE CHAIR FOR THEIR WORK ON THE BILL AND HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS -- ALSO I'M COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING CONCERNS REGARDING LOCAL ZONING DESIGNATION SO WILL BE MEETING WITH VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS TO TRY TO FIND A WORKABLE. SOLUTION THIS IS A FOLLOW UP I JUST THIS IS A FOLLOW UP TO MY LEGISLATION IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THAT -- GAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS THE FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL ON SURPLUS PUBLIC LANDS. UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE SAW IS ONCE THAT LAW WENT INTO EFFECT -- SO JURISDICTIONS TRY TO CIRCUMVENT IT I JUST TO SPECIFIC EXAMPLES CALTRAIN -- IN IN THE BAY AREA DID NOT OFFER A SITE -- BY ITS HE WORE PARK STATION TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS AND STAND WORK EXCLUSIVELY WITH A MARKET RATE DEVELOPER -- THE CITY BURLINGAME THE CREDIT HEALTH DISTRICT ON THE SIDE OF A PLUMBER PUBLIC HOSPITAL WITH A PROPOSED TO BUILD A SENIOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER WITH NO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO AGAIN WE WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE HAVE -- MANY OF OUR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES HAVE SURPLUS PUBLIC LAND WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT HOUSE THEY DISPOSE OF THAT THAT THEIR PRIORITIES REALLY ARE LINED WITH OUR PRIORITIES WHICH HAVE TO BE AROUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO AGAIN WE HAVE TO CLARIFY POSITION BY PROVISIONS I WOULD CREATE WE'RE ASKING THE QUESTION TO STATEWIDE DATABASE AS WELL AS BUILDING ON THE COVERAGE EXECUTIVE ORDER FOR STATE INVOLVEMENT AND ALSO LEVERAGING. HOUSING ELEMENT LOT MOST USE AND EFFICIENCY OF THE SURPLUS LAND ACT WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON CHEROKEE ARE CURRY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS PATRICK ALTHOUGH AND I'M WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE FORTY YEAR OLD THE FOR THE HOUSING ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION -- WITH SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEMBERS REPRESENTING BUSINESSES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. PLANNERS AND JUST REGULAR PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE AN AFFORDABLE PLACE TO CALL HOME -- AND WE THINK THAT AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX WILL HELP US GET THERE ESPECIALLY IN THE BAY AREA. NO ONE CAN DENY THAT OUR THAT OUR STATE IS FACING AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING EMERGENCY. WE HAVE THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF HOMELESS PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY AND WE RANK BILL HIGHEST IN TERMS OF POVERTY RATE WHEN HOUSING COSTS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT -- BUILDING MORE AFFORDABLE HOMES FOR SENIORS VETERANS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE AND PUBLICLY OWNED LAND PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN MAKING THAT HAPPEN. SO. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIANG SIDE CLARIFIES AND STRENGTHENS THE CAROL CALIFORNIA SURPLUS LAND ACT THE LAW THAT HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR FIFTY YEARS. BUT THAT HAS SUFFERED FROM SPOTTING ENFORCEMENTS -- THE PURPOSE OF THE SURPLUS LAND ACT IS TO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC LAND IS USED FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD. WHEN IT IS NO LONGER NEEDED FOR GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSES -- BY PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT ARE DISPOSING OF THAT PLAN TO PRIORITIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AND OPEN SPACE ON THAT PLAN. UNDER CURRENT LAW -- WHILE LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO DO THIS LIKE I SAID FOR FIFTY YEARS THERE HAS BEEN -- SPOTTING ENFORCEMENT AND THE AND THIS BILL FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX ADDRESSES MANY OF THE ISSUES WITH GETTING THE LAW AND FORCED. SUCH AS FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX WILL CREATE A STATEWIDE DATABASE OF PUBLICLY OWNED SITES AND HOW THEY ARE CURRENTLY BEING USED. THIS IS TO PROVIDE CLARITY ON WHAT LAND EVEN EXISTS -- IF YOU ASK MANY LOCAL AGENCIES THEY DO NOT FULLY KNOW WHAT THEY OWN -- IT WILL CREATE A PROCESS FOR STATE PLANS THAT MIRRORS THE PROCESS FOR LOCAL AGENCIES AND DISPOSING OF THEIR LANDS TO PRIORITIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW. STATE LANDS AND LOCAL AGENCY ON LANDS ARE FOLLOW DIFFERENT TRACKS AND SO IT CREATES AS ST THE SAME PROCESS PURPLE. IT CLARIFIES THAT PUBLICLY OWNED LAND IS NOT SURPLUS IF IT IS SERVING ANY GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSE -- AND SO THIS THIS PROVIDES CRITICAL CLARITY THAT IF YOU BOUGHT THE LAND FOR A PARKER IF YOU BOUGHT THE LAND FOR SCHOOL AND YOU'RE USING THE LAND FOR PARKER SCHOOL. AND HAD MAKING I'M A MOTION TO DO SO THAT LAND IS NOT SURPLUS IT IS BEING USED FOR GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSE. AND IT ALSO HAS SOME CRITICAL EXEMPTIONS -- THERE'S OVER SEVENTEEN OF THEM HOME SO I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM BUT CRITICAL EXEMPTIONS TO ENSURE THAT LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSE IF THE LAND IS BEING USED FOR LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSES THAT THOSE ARE EXEMPTED OUT OF THE SURPLUS LAND ACT. AND SO THIRTIES ANOTHER TECHNICAL CHANGES AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THOUSANDS OF ACRES IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE MOMENT MAINLY BEING USED AS PARKING LOT OR SITTING EMPTY CAN BE USED TO HOUSE. ARE LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO LIVE HERE. AND SO -- BY PASSING THIS BILL WE ARE GOING TO HELP TO BRING TO LIFE A PROMISE THAT THE STATE MADE OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO. THAT PUBLIC LANDS OUGHT TO BENEFIT THE PUBLIC GOOD SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU. WELCOME CHAIR IDEACURRY -- HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS A FRIEND GOT EAGLE HERE WITH BURBANK HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE NONPROFIT -- FORCIBLE HOUSING DEVELOPER -- WE HAVE LED THE NORTH BAY I COMMUNITIES -- IN MAINTAINING QUALITY SUSTAINABLE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE. DEVELOP A LAND IS ONE OF THE LARGEST OBSTACLES AND SIGNIFICANT HURDLES. IN BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND OFTEN TIMES IT'S NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS THAT ARE LEFT WITH THE PARCELS THAT ARE MOST DIFFICULT TO BUILD. OFTENTIMES PASSED BY MARKET RATE DEVELOPERS. BUY MORE OFFICIALLY TRANSFORMING HOW PUBLIC LANDS INTO PUBLIC COULD NOT PROFIT HOUSING DEVELOPERS LIKE US CAN DO MORE -- WE DO BELIEVE THAT BY CLARIFYING AND STRENGTHENING THE KEY PROVISIONS OF THE SURPLUS LAND ACT. WOULD BE ABLE TO CREATE MORE AFFORDABLE HOW HOMES IN OUR COMMUNITY. THE ISSUE IS ONLY BECOME GREATER -- IN THE NORTH BAY -- THE RECENT LOSS OF THOUSANDS OF HOMES -- WITH THE WILD FIRES OVER LAST COUPLE OF YEARS -- AND WITH FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE CURRENTLY ON A WAIT LIST -- WE MUST LOOK AT ALL AVAILABLE TOOLS AND PUBLIC LANDS CAN AND DO PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN REBUILT AND ARE REBUILDING EFFORTS. AS A FORMER SUPERVISOR IN THE COUNTY OF CINEMA I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING ON THE COUNTIES HOUSING FOR ALL PRIORITIES. FOCUSING ON THE RE USE OF SELECT COUNTY OWNED PROPERTIES FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT THAT COULD BRING UP TO THIRTEEN HUNDRED UNITS INTO THECOMING YEARS -- THERE IS GREAT ALIGNMENT WITH WHAT THE COUNTY IN CITIES AND CINEMA COUNTY ARE DOING -- IN COLLABORATION WITH CITIES WERE ALSO ESTIMATING THE DEVELOPING OF TWO THOUSAND ADDITIONAL UNITS INVOLVING PUBLICLY OWNED PARCELS THERE SANTA ROSA JUNIOR COLLEGE AS WELL AS A SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE HAVING THE SAME CONVERSATION. I LIKE THAT MY REMARKS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT THAT OCCURRED TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AGO THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA OWNED A VACANT UNUSED PARCEL. THAT WAS DâN DONATED TO HABITAT FOR HUMANITY. THAT HABITAT WAS ABLE -- TO FOR BUILD ITS FIRST HOME -- THROUGH THIS PARTNERSHIP AND EVEN THOUGH I WAS TEN YEARS OLD WHEN THIS IT TOOK PLACE -- I KNOW IT SO WELL BECAUSE IT WAS MY FAMILY THAT ACTUALLY HAD THE CHANCE TO LIVE IN THAT HOME -- FOR MY IMMIGRANT PARENTS WHO ONLY RECEIVED A GRADE SCHOOL EDUCATION FOR MEDICAL THIS WAS A PIVOTAL POINT AND GAME CHANGER AND CERTAINLY ONE FOR ME.

ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS ROUNDER ROSTER CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION WE ARE RESPECTFULLY POST MUST AMENDED TO THE MEASURE. OUR PRIMARY CONCERN IS THE APPLICATION OF THE SURPLUS LAND ACT TO LEASES -- THIS IS PROBLEMATIC FOR PUBLICATION SEES THAT DO HAVE VALID REASONS TO LEASE OR OTHERWISE PROTECT THE LAND THAT THEY OWN FOR INSTANCE MANY OF OUR HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS. THE STOP THEIR FACILITIES TO MEDICAL PROVIDERS FOR REDUCED RATE THIS PROVIDES A PUBLIC BENEFIT AS WELL AS HELP SUPPORT THEIR MISSION. SECONDLY. OF OUR CEMETERY DISTRICTS LEASE UP THEIR LAND TO FARMERS PRIOR PRIOR TO USING THE LAND FOR FUTURE. FUTURE BURIALS THIS IS A LOW IMPACT WAY OF USING THE LAND IT RESULTS IN NOT HAVING TO TEAR OUT HOUSING OR AFFECT PEOPLE ONCE THE LAND COMES BACK TO THE DISTRICT AB FOR FUTURE BURIALS. WE WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND THE COMEDIAN AUTHOR FOR TODAY'S AMENDMENTS WHICH REMOVE LEASES FROM THE SCOPE THE BILL IN THE SURPLUS LAND ACT. I WE DO STILL HAVE CERTAIN OUTSTANDING ISSUES ON THE BILL -- FIRSTLY WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BILL HAVE A PROCESS THAT ALLOWS AGENCIES. DISCRETION TO DETERMINE WHAT LANDIS ACTUALLY SURPLUS TO THE MISSION AND PURPOSE. AND SECONDLY AGENCIES DO YOU HAVE A NEED FOR INFORMAL AND FORMAL NEGOTIATIONS -- MEETING WITH DEVELOPERS ME WITH REAL ESTATE AGENTS THIS HELPS THEM ASSESS THE MARKET VALUE OF THEIR LAND AND MAKE GOOD DECISIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC. SO WITH THAT WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE BILL SO FAR. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THIS DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. I HAS THEIR BRIDGE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS ARE WE WERE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDMENT AMENDED TO THE ORIGINAL BILL AND HAVE NOT YET HAD. THE TIME TO LOOK OVER THE AMENDMENTS BUT WE DO THINK THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US OUR OUR PRIMARY CONCERN. IS ALIGNED WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION IN TERMS OF OUR HOSPITAL LEASES -- WE WANT THE ABILITY TO USE OUR HOSTAGE TO LEASE LAND FOR HEALTHCARE PURPOSES WHEN IT MAKES SENSE -- BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE -- AND READING OVER THE AMENDMENTS AND OUT WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

AND THE SECOND. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE DISTRICT THING IS JUST VERY QUICKLY REALLY THANK -- THE COMMITTEE'S WORK ON THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE WELL LEASES THAT THAT'S BEEN REMOVED. AGAIN JUST READ REALLY QUICKLY I THINK IN TERMS OF MARKET VALUE WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO DETERMINE MARKET VALUE -- FOR EXAMPLE A MARKET APPRAISALS TOLLEY A REASONABLE WAY TO DO THAT -- IN TERMS OF DISCRETION THAT THE CHALLENGES WITH DISCRETION AS WE'VE SEEN THE PAST AS IF YOU GIVE THE DISTRICTS THE DISCRETION UNFORTUNATELY. THEY'LL BASICALLY SAY NOTHING A SURPLUS I THINK THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES -- SO AGAIN. HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE WE HOPE THAT WE CAN OBVIOUSLY IF WE CAN REACH AGREEMENT LEAST ISSUE. HOPING THAT WE CAN FIND AGREEMENT ON SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES MOVING FORWARD BUT RESPECT FAST FIVE I THOUGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- HI. THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS LISTENING ANALYSIS THIS IS AN AMBITIOUS BILL I SUPPORT YOUR WORK ON TIGHTENING UP TO STATUTES RELATED TO SURPLUS LAND FOR BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES.

THREE OF US THREE OF US I ROBERT RIVAS. ROBERT RIVERSIDE VOEPEL VOEPEL I OUT SEVEN ZERO CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU REMOVE UNDER ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROBERT RIVAS ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN AB. TWELVE FIFTY FIVE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR COLLEAGUES -- SHOULD COMMITTEE STAFF WORK ON THE ANALYSIS I DO SO -- EXCEPT THE AND THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS -- THIS BILL ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE FIFTY FIVE BUILT UPON THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. TO CREATE A DIGITIZED INVENTORY OF SURPLUS STATE PROPERTY. I THAT COULD BE USED FOR FOR WHAT HOUSING AND SO THE IDEA BEHIND THIS BILL IS TO CREATE A SEARCHABLE INVENTORY OF SURPLUS LOCAL -- THE LOCAL -- THE GOVERNOR PROPERTY THAT FOCUSES ON INFILL AND HIGH DENSITY PROJECTS -- AND SO IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE DECISIONS ON WHAT TO DO WITH THE SURPLUS PROPERTY ARE ENTIRELY LET THE LOCAL CONTROL. AND SO THE GOAL IS TO HELP CREATE UNEXPECTED OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMART PROJECTS. TO HELP MEET OUR HOUSING NEEDS -- AND ACCORDING TO THE BILL -- OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES WOULD REPORT -- THE INFORMATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES WHICH WOULD CREATE -- A DATABASE -- I AND I HAD BEEN WORKING WITH -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEEING AND I'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM ARE BILLS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT -- AND SO CERTAINLY -- LOOK FOR TO MAKE SURE THAT -- YOU KNOW. WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO TWO OUT WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND THEN -- I DO HAVE A WITNESS HERE WHO -- IS HERE IN SUPPORT SO. THANK YOU. WELCOME. BUT I'M CHAIR MEMBERS JENNIFER SPECK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATIONOF REALTORS WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE THE EFFORTS BY THIS ON WOMEN WILL HELP -- TO STREAMLINED THE EFFORTS BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER BY IDENTIFYING LOCAL SITES AVAILABLE FOR A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. I'M IT MAY ALSO RESULT AS WE CREATE AND POPULATE THE TGS DATABASE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXCHANGE LAND BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE GOVERNMENT IF ANOTHER SITE IS NECESSARY. IT'LL FACILITATE THAT COMMUNICATION IF WE KNOW WHAT EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE HAPPENING ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE LAURIE JOHNSON ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SALINAS AND SUPPORT GOOD MOVE. ARE THERE ANY -- WITNESSES OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. YES -- COULD YOU MOST CITIES A HAVE TO ALREADY REPORT THE SITES OF THEIR IDENTIFYING FOR HIGH DENSITY DEVELOPMENT IN THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATES. SO WHAT IS THE INTENTION OF DOING ADDITIONAL REPORTING THAT CAUSES A MINISTRY OF COSTS FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IF THEY'RE ALREADY BEING IDENTIFIED IN THE HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATES. SO THE REASON WE HAVE THIS BILLS BECAUSE THESE PROBABLY AREN'T BE IDENTIFIED IN -- CERTAINLY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALREADY DO AND SO THE WHAT SO WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT IS ABOUT UNEXPECTED OPPORTUNITIES AND SO REALLY MAKING SURE THAT WE FOLLOW IN THE GOVERNOR'S -- YOU KNOW EXECUTIVE ORDER TO IDENTIFY SURPLUS STATE PROPERTIES -- THIS WILL TAKE A STEP FURTHER TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALSO HAVE THESE OPPORTUNITIES -- AND THAT WOULD ADDRESS A SIGNIFICANT NEED YOU KNOW ALTERNATELY IT'S ABOUT ESTABLISHING UNEXPECTED PARTNERSHIPS -- AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MEET OUR HOUSING GOALS BASED ON OUR IN OUR ARENA NUMBERS -- AND SO THIS IS JUST ANOTHER TOOL IT'S ANOTHER TOLD TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WE'RE ATTACKING -- AND YOU KNOW THIS A HOUSING CRISIS AND DO EVERYTHING WE CAN FROM YOU KNOW A STATE STANDPOINT AND WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT THIS. IS WE ARE MAINTAINING LOCAL CONTROL THE ALTERNATELY THESE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE GOING TO DO WHEN THEY'RE GONNA MAKE THE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR LAND USE PATTERNS AND AND YOU KNOW WHAT CAN YOU HAVE IF THAT THEY IDENTIFY THESE INFILL OPPORTUNITIES. IT'S ENTIRELY UP -- TO YOU KNOW THEIR DISCRETION. SOMEONE IF I MIGHT. THIS BILL WORK FANTASTIC -- THE SOMEONE NUMBER TINGS BILL WHICH IS GONNA BECAUSE DH CD TO ACTUALLY DO THE COMPILATION RIGHT NOW THE INFORMATION AS REPORTED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- TO DHC DEEP BUT THERE'S NOTHING DONE WITH IT AFTER THAT AND THE GOAL AT THIS POINT IS TO CREATE THAT ONLINE USABLE REPOSITORY -- SO IT'LL BE A PARTNERSHIP IN THE IN BETWEEN AS WOMEN REVERSES BILL AND IS A MEMBER KINGS BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INFORMATION IS GIVEN THE TGS. AND THEN PROVIDED THE PUBLIC IN A FORMAT THAT'S EASILY SEARCHABLE. OKAY I UNDERSTAND I THINK -- COMING FROM AN AREA WHERE HOUSING IS DIFFICULT AND FINDING A VERY BUILT OUT AND FINDING MORE PROPERTIES IS EVEN MORE TO WELL I THINK THERE'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE HURDLE. THAT THE CITIES OF MY DISTRICT WOULD FACE AT THIS TIME I WILL NOT BE VOTING ON THE BILL BUT I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU.

YET THAT WE CAN SOLVE THIS HERE REPRESENTING THE CITY OF FAIRFIELD WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OKAY. WHAT THIS IS IN OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- SURE AGUIAR-CURRY AND INVOICE AND VICE CHAIR. MY NAME'S GOING FROM I AM -- REPRESENTING THE SOLANO COUNTY ORDERLY GROWTH COMMITTEE TODAY. WE ARE OPPOSED AB FIVE THIRTY UNLESS AMENDED WE'VE HAD -- CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH THE IT STAFF WITH -- THE CHAIR AT WITH SIR DISTRICT AND WITH LOCAL PLAYERS AND SOLANO COUNTY. THE SLAUGHTER COUNTY EARLY GROWTH COMMITTEE IS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL OVER MANY DECADES IN TERMS OF KEEPING SOLANO COUNTY'S FARMERS OPEN SPACES WELL PROTECTED -- THOSE OF YOU WHO LIVE OR VISIT THE BAY AREA FROM SACRAMENTO WHEN YOU DRIVE THROUGH SOLANO COUNTY. IN FROM DIXON THE VALLEJO IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT -- PORTIONS OF OUR COUNTY THE REMAIN GREEN UNDEVELOPED IN VERY PRODUCTIVE FARMLAND FOR MANY DECADES. AND THIS ABOUT A PROCESS THAT HAS NOT BEEN EASY IT'S INVOLVED -- POLICIES POLITICS -- MANY ELECTIONS INITIATIVES AND OCCASIONALLY LAWSUIT WHAT WE SEE TODAY WITH THE LEGISLATION THAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU. IS THE SUBTLE LANGUAGE SHOULD SETTLING WHICH THAT WOULD OPEN UP A RURAL SOLANO COUNTY TO THE POSSIBILITY. OF UNWISE -- SPRAWL TYPE DEVELOPMENTS IN ON CURRENTLY WITH ME WELL PROTECTED FARMLANDS IN SOME CASES WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH PROJECTS IN THE COUNTY. IS THEY'VE BEEN STOPPED OR STALLED BECAUSE THE INABILITY TO DO ADEQUATE SEWAGE TREATMENT WE ALSO TIMES OF PROBLEMS WITH -- PROJECTS HAVE HAD TROUBLE GETTING -- WATER THEY WANT MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLIES WE HAVE A STRONG POLICY IN SOLANO COUNTY. OF OF WHAT IS URBAN SHALL BE MUNICIPAL AND WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT POLICY CONTINUES. THE THE LANGUAGE THAT WE RECOMMENDED IT WHICH WE HOPE YOU WILL RECEIVE VIA LETTERS THAT HAVE BEEN SENT IN BY THE EARLY GROWTH COMMITTEE. IS THAT TO AMEND THE LANGUAGE OF THAT LANDS IN THE UNINCORPORATED PART OF SOLANO COUNTY WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DELIVER BIO SALAS TO THE FAIR TEXAS IN PLANTS. WHAT TO DO WITH THE FAIRFIELD TO SOON PLAN IN TERMS OF PROCESSING IS EXCELLENT THE DOING OF THEY'RE DOING A WONDERFUL JOB OF TAKING BY ALL SOLID MATERIALS? RUNNING IT THROUGH AN ADDITIONAL PROCESSING STEP -- AND THEN HAVING HIGH QUALITY FERTILIZER THE GET SENT OUT TO THE TO THE FARMS IN OUR REGION WE WE THINK THAT'S JUST TERRIFIC. THE QUESTION BECOMES WHERE THAT MATERIAL COMES FROM. SO WE URGE YOU TODAY TO VOTE NO ON FIVE THIRTY UNLESS IT'S AMENDED CAN CAN CONSISTENT WITH. THE MEMBERS THAT WE HAVE SENT TO YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I I SHOULD PROBABLY ANNOUNCED THAT WHICH WE'LL GET TO MAINE AND WITNESSES. EITHER SIDE AND THE REST WERE JUST. IF OKAY EXPRESSIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS NOR DECIDE I REPRESENT THE SECTION OF FAIRFIELD THAT WILL BE MOST IMPACTED BY THESE CHANGES. THE ADDITION OR THE INCLUSION OF COUNTY PROPERTY. SO PROPERTIES OUTSIDE OF THE CITIES [inaudible] WILL. INCLUDE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS.% AND WE ARE READY SEVERELY IMPACTED. IN OUR AREA WE'VE GOT APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HOMES. OUR CITY HAS BEEN PROLIFIC IN WORKING ON DEVELOPMENTS WHICH IS WONDERFUL THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT IT. WE'VE GOT FOUR SCHOOLS. IN OUR AREA. WHERE THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED CHILDREN THE MAIN ROAD? THAT PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE SCHOOLS. IS JUST TWO LINES YOU HAVE TO COME TO A FULL STOP BEFORE YOU CAN ACCESS. THE FREEWAY. THE ROADS IN ADEQUATE TRAFFIC FLOW IS INADEQUATE. BUT THEN ON TOP OF THAT WE'VE GOT A SCHOOL DISTRICT. THAT HAS ONLY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. TO INCREASE CAPACITY [inaudible] AND WE ARE ALREADY HAVING PROBLEMS AT OUR SCHOOLS WHERE THEY ARE. BEING TURNED AWAY TO OTHER. SCHOOLS IN THE DISTRICT. THE SCHOOL CANNOT INCREASE ITS CAPACITY WE'VE GOT IN OTHER PARTS OF FAIRFIELD NEAR THE NEW TRAIN STATION WHERE THERE BE APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND NEW HOMES. AND AGAIN THIS IS THE SAME SCHOOL SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO INCREASE. SERVICE TO ALL THESE NEW HOMES THAT ARE BEING APPROVED NOT ALLOWING. THE GREEN THE SKIS ME SPECIFIC MIDDLE GREEN VALLEY. TO CONNECT TO THE SEWER SYSTEM IS NOT GOING TO STOP THE PROJECT. THEY CAN GO AHEAD AND BUILD IT. THERE ARE NO SUBJECTS. SYSTEMS THAT WE USE THEY'LL BUILD THEIR OWN SEWER SYSTEM AND WHAT WE NEED. IS TIME. THERE IT WILL TAKE TIME FOR THEM TO DO THAT AND WE NEED THAT TIME BECAUSE WE ARE ALREADY IN TROUBLE. WE JUST CANNOT ACCOMMODATE. THESE ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED HOMES WITH WE JUST DON'T HAPPEN THE THE THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT. PEOPLE SPEND BRING THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL. I HAVE A PARENT WHO DESCRIBED IT AS I COULD HAVE BEEN TO SAN FRANCISCO AND BACK BUT NO I'M STUCK IN ALL THIS TRAFFIC. BECAUSE WE HAVE LIKE I SAY IN ADEQUATE COULD ROADS. AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. THE WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY AT THE SCHOOLS HOW IS IT THAT. THESE FOUR HUNDRED HOMES WHICH BY THE WAY THEY'RE NOT AFFORDABLE HOMES THE HOMES THAT THAT ARE APPROVED IN CITY. THERE ARE MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE IF YOU'RE GONNA COMPARED THEM -- THIS WILL HELP VERY AFFLUENT PEOPLE. TO THE DETRIMENT OF THOSE OF US WHO ARE REGULAR RESIDENTS. WE DON'T WANNA HAVE. A CRISIS AND THIS IS. JUST SETTING UP THE CRISIS IT'S ALREADY A PROBLEM. THIS IS A TERRIBLE CRISIS I HOPE. OF THAT YOU WILL VOTE FOR THE MEASURES THAT. X. EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR MIDDLE BRING VALLEY BEING ALLOWED TO CONNECT. BECAUSE THAT ALSO IS JUST. THE START THERE ARE OTHER. DEVELOPERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN DOING THE SAME THING AND AGAIN SAME PROBLEMS. WE DON'T HAVE THE ROADS WE DON'T HAVE DISCO CAPACITY. PLEASE THINK ABOUT US. LESS WEALTHY PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO LIVE IN OUR AREA AND A FOUR EIGHT A DISASTER WITH OUR SCHOOLS THANK YOU. ANY OF THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. HI I'M AMY HEART AND THEN THE SOLANO COUNTY REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR GREEN DOT ALLIANCE -- WE'RE A NONPROFIT BASED IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA AND WE WORK AT THE INTERSECTION OF OPEN SPACE PROTECTION AND SMART GROWTH -- WE ARE ALSO -- TAKING THE POSITION OF OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THIS LEGISLATION COULD UNINTENTIONALLY OPEN UP PRIME AGRICULTURAL LAND TO DENSER DEVELOPMENT -- TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ESTHER PRIOR AND I REPRESENT RAFEAL HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION. WHOSE MEMBERS RESIDE IN SIOUX SOON VALLEY WHICH IS AN UNINCORPORATED AREA OF SOLANO COUNTY. I HOPE THE COMMITTEE HAS RECEIVED THE COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE LOCAL RESIDENTS IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. I OPPOSE AB FIVE THIRTY UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI MY NAME'S LORDS HER SICK. I'M A UNINCORPORATED RESIDENCE SOLANO COUNTY. AND I OPPOSE EIGHTY FIVE THIRTY UNLESS AMENDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE COMMITTED YOU. MY NAME'S LERI WELL CHAD ELEVEN ROB FAIL. IN AYE OPPOSES SAID AND THE CITIES OF AMENDED BY THE ORDERLY GROW WHAT WHAT THE ORDERLY GROWTH. RECOMMENDS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE. OKAY WE NEED A MOTION TO PASS AS AMENDED -- TO ADD URGENCY CLAUSE OKAY. THANK YOU -- I YOU KNOW I HEARD THIS THE OPPOSITION I HEARD A LOT ABOUT. SCHOOLS AND ROADS -- BUT THIS IS ABOUT. SEWER SERVICE -- I HEARD ONE SPEAKER -- EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT -- THIS BILL OPENING UP THE PRIME AG LAND TO DEVELOPMENT. I'M. NOT QUITE SURE HOW THAT HAPPENS AS A RESULT OF THIS BILL CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT. SO I ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE ASKING -- FOR THAT NOT I'M NOT ASKING ABOUT THEM AND I'M ASKING HOW THE BILL AS IT'S PROPOSED SHORE CAT -- WOULD WOULD DO THAT SAID THE LEGISLATION ALLOWS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF PACKAGE SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANTS AND WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT THOSE PACKAGE SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANTS COULD BE BUILT. OUTSIDE OF EXISTING URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARIES AND SOLANO COUNTY -- FURTHER LEADING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS THAT WOULD BE CREATING SPRAWL IN THE COUNTY SO THAT'S IN IT IT WOULD BE ON PRIME AG LAND SURROUNDING SOLANO THANK YOU -- I'D LIKE BECAUSE OF THE AUTHORS EXPERTS TO WITNESSES TO RESPOND TO THAT IF FOR A IF YOU LIKE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. TO CLARIFY THE GENERAL PLAN OF THE COUNTY IS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS OF SOLANO COUNTY ALMOST 75% IN THIS DISTRICT APPROVED. NO ZONING NO AGRICULTURAL ZONING CAN BE CHANGED WITHOUT A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE. AND SO WHAT MONDAY TALK ABOUT URBAN SPRAWL THE CANNOT TAKE PLACE UNLESS THE GENERAL PLAN IS AMENDED OR VOTED ON BY THE PUBLIC AND SO. IT DOES NOT CREATE URBAN SPRAWL THERE'S A DESIGNATED AREAS AND COUNTY THAT CAN BE DEVELOPED THAT'S ALL THAT CAN BE. DEVELOPED IN THE COUNTY. THEN THE THE OTHER -- CONCERN I HEARD WAS THAT. SOMEHOW -- THE SEWERS -- SEWER SERVICE WAS GOING -- TO AND THAT BEING BROUGHT FROM ONE AREA INTO ANOTHER AREA AND MAYBE YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE BETTER THAN I JUST TRIED. TO ARTICULATE A CAN YOU RESTATE THAT AND SURE. A FURTHER EXPLAIN SURE DOING CRIME AGAIN SO THE THE FAIRFIELD TO SOON SEWER DISTRICT PLANT WHICH BY DEFINITION FEARFUL TO SENATE WAS BUILT TO ACCOMMODATE TO CITIES. BUT OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS GREG. THEY'VE IMPORTER THE NEW TECHNOLOGY -- CAME OUT OF CANADA THIS IS THE TO TRAFFIC TECHNOLOGY THAT RUNS -- BILE SALTS BOTH FROM THEIR PLANT AND FROM OTHER PLANTS AROUND THE BAY AREA THEIR TRUCKED INTO THE FAIRFIELD TO SOON PLANT. TO TREAT THOSE BIOSOLIDS TO IT TO A HIGHER DEGREE OF CLEANLINESS PURITY. THE BECOME A HIGHER QUALITY FERTILIZER I THINK IS PROBABLY YOU KNOW EMINEM MUCH WITH MUCH OF WHILE SOLDIERS WHO TREATMENT PLANTS. IS APPLIED LAND APPLIED ACROSS. THE STATE PROBABLY ACROSS COUNTRY HEARING AREAS TO USE AS FERTILIZER. SO THE ABILITY TO BRING IN THAT MATERIAL RIGHT NOW IT'S PROBABLY NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE EXISTING SEWER DISTRICT LEGISLATION. WERE NOT WHEN IT COMES FROM OTHER -- OUTSIDE AREAS OUTSIDE OF FAIRFIELD TO SOON. WE THINK IT'S A FINE IDEA TO BRING AND STUFF FROM. MUNICIPAL SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANTS THAT SERVE YOU INCORPORATED AN URBANIZED AREAS. IN IN THE RURAL AREAS WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF THE PROPOSED AND SOLANO COUNTY -- SUPERVISORS BERRY AND I GO BACK AND FORTH REGULARLY ON DEVELOPMENT ISSUES. BUT THERE'S BEEN REGULAR PROPOSALS TO HAVE -- FANCIER SEPARATE TYPE SYSTEMS AFTER PUMPED OUT PACKAGE SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANTS THAT THEN THEY HAVE TO GET RID OF THEIR MATERIAL THAT THEY CAN'T BRING IT UP TO A HIGH ENOUGH QUALITY. ON SITE TO HANDLE WITH THE REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD REQUIRES SO IF THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SOMETHING OF A LOWER QUALITY TREATMENT SYSTEM ON SITE. AND THEN HOLD THE MATERIALS TO THE FAIRFIELD TO SOME PLANT. GOOD ENVIRONMENTALLY AFTER PROJECTS BEEN BUILT. BUT IF THAT ENCOURAGES AND INCENTIVIZE IS PROJECTS TO BE BUILT IN THAT PLACES WE HAVE A CONCERN THAT'S ALL OUR CONCERN IS. DON'T INCENTIVIZE THE POTENTIALITY. OF PUTTING SUBDIVISION DEVELOPMENTS ON FARM LET. AND WHAT IF I COULD GET A RISK I MIGHT OUT TONIGHT I'M CERTIFICATION THE BILL DOESN'T ADD THE PROVISIONS TO PUT IN THE SORT OF PACKAGE TREATMENT PLANTS THAT ALREADY EXISTS THOSE CAN BE DONE. REGARDLESS OF THIS BILL IF THE COUNTY APPROVED THE PROJECTS THEY CAN BUILD THESE ON SITE TREATMENT SYSTEMS AND THEY CAN. TRUCK THAT TO ANY OTHER FACILITY THIS BILL WOULD ONLY PREVENT THEM FROM TRACKING IT TO THE IT AS AMENDED BY. THE ORDERLY GROWTH PEOPLE. WOULD ONLY PROHIBIT THAT FROM COMING TO THE FAIRFIELD TOO SOON SEWER DISTRICT NOT TO THE PLANTS IN BACK OF BILL OR DELAYED OR BENICIA OR ANY OTHER PLANT THROUGHOUT SOLANO COUNTY SO THAT. THIS DOES NOT HELP THAT PARTICULAR PROVISION. OKAY -- I THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE I I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL I UNDERSTAND THERE'S OPPOSITION TO THIS I'VE SEEN THIS KIND OF OPPOSITION -- COME UP ALL ACROSS THE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- WHEN -- FOLKS DON'T WANT TO SEE DEVELOPMENT TO HAPPEN I UNDERSTAND IT I GET IT -- BUT WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A HOUSING CRISIS. AND TO WE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT. I DON'T SEE THAT THIS IS A RESPONSIBLE SIMPLY BECAUSE SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN -- THE OPPOSITION SEEMS VERY SPECULATIVE TO MAY AND TO AND PLEASE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL. SUMMARY YES AND I JUST YOU KNOW I A I CAN QUOTE THE COMMENTS YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION AND THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT YOU KNOW THE RISK OF OF THIS YOU KNOW. POTENTIAL -- THE DEVICE FOR THE BUILDINGS GOOD PLANNING I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S A SOMETHING THAT'S WELL GROUNDED -- IN THE ANALYSIS BUT YOU KNOW THE THINGS I HEARD ABOUT ROAD ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE. YOU KNOW -- HAD A YOU KNOW. NOT BEEN IN THIS ROOM IN HER THOSE COMMENTS I'D BE LIKE NOW THEY TALKING ABOUT THE SALINAS VALLEY AS MY DISTRICT. A BECAUSE WE SUFFER -- AS WELL -- AND IT'S THESE KIND OF CONDITIONS THAT HAVE -- THEY'VE DEPRESSED THE HOUSING IN OUR AREA AND REALLY. THROUGHOUT ALL OF CALIFORNIA AND WHAT'S THE END RESULT FOR US I MEAN WORK COUNTY MONTEREY COUNTY IT LEADS THE STATE IN STUDENT HOMELESSNESS. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING IN OVERCROWDED -- YOU KNOW HOUSES THERE -- IN. THE THESE TERRIBLE CONDITIONS -- AND SO REALLY -- YOU KNOW WE NEED TO DO MORE TO SUPPORT OUR FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES AND IN PROPER PLANNING IS PART OF THAT PROCESS SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. AS CHAIR SYSTEM REAL QUICK ON THE ASPECT OF THE LAUGHED BECAUSE IN THE AREAS THAT INCREASING THE SPEED OF INFLUENCE OR IS IT STILL A PROCESS. THE NEED TO GO THROUGH LEFT -- AND THEN UPON THE COMPLETION OF THAT AND APPROVAL OF THAT THESE PLANS GOING TO INTO EFFECT. CAN BE OBVIOUSLY WE I ALWAYS ENCOURAGE LEFT GO WHEN YOU CAN BECAUSE IT GIVES US ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE PUBLIC OUTREACH IN THIS THAT PROCESS WILL HAPPEN. IN THESE INDIVIDUALS AS WELL CAN -- BE AT THOSE THAT THE TABLE THOSE AS WELL LEFT BECAUSE IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS THEY IT THE THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THIS WITH THE GENERAL PLAN WITH US SOLANO COUNTY. FOR QUITE SOME TIME IS ACCEPTED BY THE RESIDENTS THEY VOTED ON IT -- THEY'VE HAD LOTS OF PUBLIC OUT REACH BUT THIS THEY'VE EVEN AGREED TO DO THE SECOND STEP. THANK YOU.
