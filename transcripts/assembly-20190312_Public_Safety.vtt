CONTINUE TO DO SO.

00:31:16.808 --> 00:31:18.343
BUT CLEARLY ONE OF THE PROBLEMS

00:31:18.409 --> 00:31:19.811
IS THAT --

00:31:19.877 --> 00:31:21.446

WAS NOT AWARE AND BUT WE REALLY

00:35:11.676 --> 00:35:13.110
WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT

00:35:13.177 --> 00:35:14.145
EVERY.

00:35:14.212 --> 00:35:16.380
COUNTY REACHES OUT TO THE

00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:17.482

CONSEQUENCES THE HARDSHIP OF

00:39:46.951 --> 00:39:48.586

EXPENSIVE IT IS TO PROSECUTE A

00:39:55.793 --> 00:39:56.761
FELONY.

00:39:56.827 --> 00:39:57.928
CHILDREN HAVE LOST THEIR MOTHER

00:39:57.995 --> 00:39:59.663

MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND KNOCKS

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.001
ON THE DOOR.

00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:52.236

I'LL CARRY THOSE WITH ME FOREVER --

00:43:03.213 --> 00:43:05.482
SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE THE

00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:07.217

00:43:08.585 --> 00:43:09.853
ANY MANNER --

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.188
BUT TO HEAR THAT IT WAS FROM

00:43:11.255 --> 00:43:12.389
SOMEBODY.

00:43:12.456 --> 00:43:14.024

00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:16.260
REMEMBER?

00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:17.328
JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S BEEN

00:43:17.394 --> 00:43:19.763
ARRESTED FIVE TIMES FOR DRIVING

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:21.765

00:43:21.832 --> 00:43:22.900

00:43:22.967 --> 00:43:24.101
THOUSANDS OF TIMES THEY'VE

00:43:24.168 --> 00:43:25.135
DRIVEN.

00:43:25.202 --> 00:43:26.637
AND GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT.

00:43:26.704 --> 00:43:28.238
I BELIEVE THE STATISTIC IS ON A

00:43:28.305 --> 00:43:30.307
FRIDAY OR SATURDAY NIGHT --

00:43:30.374 --> 00:43:32.276
ONE IN EVERY TEN CARS AROUND YOU

00:43:32.343 --> 00:43:34.545

00:43:34.611 --> 00:43:34.812
DRIVING.

00:43:34.878 --> 00:43:38.615
SO -- AFTER

OUR HOME DETENTION PROGRAMS I

00:43:46.824 --> 00:43:48.158
WAS THE ONE TO PUT POLICIES IN

00:43:48.225 --> 00:43:49.593
PLACE TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO COME

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:50.761
OUT OF JAIL.

00:43:50.828 --> 00:43:52.329
AND I COULD MONITOR THEM BY

00:43:52.396 --> 00:43:53.364
PUTTING ALCOHOL BRACELETS ON

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:55.099
THEM TO FREE UP THOSE PRISON

00:43:55.165 --> 00:43:56.100

00:43:56.166 --> 00:43:58.268
JAIL CELLS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

BUT WHEN YOU GET TO YOUR FIFTY

00:44:04.541 --> 00:44:06.110
WHY EVEN THE GUYS THAT I PUT THE

HAVE TO TREAT IT.

00:44:19.189 --> 00:44:20.424
BUT AT SOME POINT WE HAVE A

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:24.261
RESPONSIBILITY TO DRAW THE LINE

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:25.996

WHEN SENTENCES IMPOSED.

00:47:08.292 --> 00:47:10.093

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.128

00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:14.198
DENYING COURT DISCRETION --

00:47:14.264 --> 00:47:16.433

YEARS WITHOUT A RELEVANT TO FANS.

00:47:27.311 --> 00:47:28.512

CALIFORNIA HAS ONLY RECENTLY

00:47:35.953 --> 00:47:37.487
BEGUN TO TURN AWAY FROM THE PATH

00:47:37.554 --> 00:47:39.056

00:48:09.853 --> 00:48:11.722
THE PAIN THAT YOU'RE TALKING

00:48:11.788 --> 00:48:14.791
ABOUT THE OF DEALING WITH PEOPLE

00:48:14.858 --> 00:48:16.526
WHO WERE IF ANA.

00:48:16.593 --> 00:48:19.229

00:48:21.765 --> 00:48:23.333
THIS AS YOU ACKNOWLEDGE IS A

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.435
SICKNESS ON ALCOHOLISM IS A

00:48:25.502 --> 00:48:26.870
DISEASE.

00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:30.440
AND HARSHER PUNISHMENT WILL NOT

00:48:30.507 --> 00:48:33.176
PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM

00:48:33.243 --> 00:48:34.144

00:48:34.211 --> 00:48:36.513
ABUSE.

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:38.715
WITH THAT I WOULD STAY ON TO SAY

00:48:38.782 --> 00:48:41.084

BE CHARGED AS A FELONY AS

00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:48.792
FELONIES HAS NOT WORKED.

00:48:48.859 --> 00:48:51.194
UNDER THE CURRENT ALL LAW THE

00:48:51.261 --> 00:48:54.564
PROSECUTORS NOW HAVE THE ABILITY

00:48:54.631 --> 00:48:55.666
TO DO THAT.

00:48:55.732 --> 00:48:57.401
AND THEY EXERCISE THEIR

00:48:57.467 --> 00:49:00.470
DISCRETION AS THEY SEE FIT.

00:49:00.537 --> 00:49:04.641
ON THIS WOULD TAKE AWAY BOTH THE

00:49:04.708 --> 00:49:06.576
DISCRETION OF THE PROSECUTORS

00:49:06.643 --> 00:49:09.313

00:49:23.493 --> 00:49:24.828
COMMUNITY [inaudible]

00:49:24.895 --> 00:49:29.499
THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS BILL

00:49:29.566 --> 00:49:31.268
WHICH ARE REALLY HARMFUL ARE THE

00:49:31.335 --> 00:49:34.705
MANDATORY HELMET --

00:49:34.771 --> 00:49:35.505
THAT.

00:49:35.572 --> 00:49:37.974
IMPOUNDING SOMEONE'S VEHICLE FOR

00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:39.876
NINETY DAYS IN MANY CASES FOR

00:49:39.943 --> 00:49:41.878
POOR PEOPLE AS THE EQUIVALENT OF

00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:43.180
FORFEITURE.

00:49:43.246 --> 00:49:44.848
AND THAT'S NOT EVEN DEALING WITH

00:49:44.915 --> 00:49:47.117
THE FACT THAT THIS --

00:49:47.184 --> 00:49:49.319
ON A PROPOSED BILL HAS

00:49:49.386 --> 00:49:51.021
FORFEITURE THAT.

00:49:51.088 --> 00:49:53.590
OF LOSING A CAR TO THE AVERAGE

00:49:53.657 --> 00:49:54.658
FAMILY.

00:49:54.725 --> 00:49:55.892
IS --

00:49:55.959 --> 00:49:58.495
DEVASTATING IN MOST COMMUNITIES

00:49:58.562 --> 00:50:01.698
YOU CANNOT GET TO WORK OR SCHOOL.

00:50:01.765 --> 00:50:02.599
ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION OUTSIDE

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:06.837

00:50:20.517 --> 00:50:21.752
STATEWIDE SO EFFICIENT COALITION

00:50:21.818 --> 00:50:23.253
SLURS BOTH IN PRIVATE PRACTICE

OPPOSITION TO THE BILL UP REALLY

00:50:29.493 --> 00:50:30.794
ARE OPPOSITION IS VERY NARROW.

00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:32.529
WE ARE CONCERNED WITH

00:50:32.596 --> 00:50:34.097
ELIMINATING THE DISCRETION THAT

00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:35.632
EXISTS NOW CURRENT LAW.

00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:36.700
THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR ATTORNEYS

00:50:36.767 --> 00:50:39.636
THAT IT'S VERY RARE WHEN A JUDGE

00:50:39.703 --> 00:50:40.971
REVIEW DA'S GOING TO TAKE.

00:50:41.037 --> 00:50:42.539

00:50:48.745 --> 00:50:50.046
IN THE BILL PLACE A FOR MORE. TO

00:50:50.113 --> 00:50:51.348
THE DISCRETION NOW IS IS REALLY

00:50:51.415 --> 00:50:52.582
APPROPRIATE --

00:50:52.649 --> 00:50:54.217
AND IT'S WORKING THE OTHER THING

00:50:54.284 --> 00:50:55.752
IS THAT DO YOU EYES AND WE'RE

00:50:55.819 --> 00:50:56.887
TALKING ABOUT.

00:50:56.953 --> 00:50:58.922
SOMEONE WHO COMES TO COURT WHERE

00:50:58.989 --> 00:51:00.123
THERE'S BEEN NO INJURY IN THE

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:02.359
PRIOR DO YOU EYES I THINK THAT'S

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:07.497
IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT --

00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:08.131
BUT DO YOU AYE IS ONE OF THOSE

00:51:08.198 --> 00:51:08.965
OFFENSES WERE DISCRETION IS ROOM

00:51:09.032 --> 00:51:09.866
PROBABLY MOST APPROPRIATE.

00:51:09.933 --> 00:51:11.435
BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF DRIVE

00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:14.404
THERE ARE A LOT OF CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:51:14.471 --> 00:51:15.739
DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES COMES DO

00:51:15.806 --> 00:51:17.274
YOU AYE UNLIKE OTHER OFFENSES

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.742
YOU OFTENTIMES ARE DEALING WITH

00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:19.876
SOMEONE WHO HAS ADDICTION

00:51:19.943 --> 00:51:20.911
OFTENTIMES IT'S SOMEBODY WHO

00:51:20.977 --> 00:51:22.345
GETS MULTIPLE DO YOU EYES IN A

00:51:22.412 --> 00:51:24.181
VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

00:51:24.247 --> 00:51:25.549
BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN ADDICTION

00:51:25.615 --> 00:51:28.685
THEY GET YOUR SEVEN YEARS OF

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:30.821
SOBRIETY THEN THE RELAPSE AND

00:51:30.887 --> 00:51:32.322
THEN THE YET ANOTHER DO YOU WHY --

00:51:32.389 --> 00:51:33.857
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE OTHER FOLKS

00:51:33.924 --> 00:51:35.425
WERE JUST OUT THERE.

00:51:35.492 --> 00:51:36.426
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER

00:51:36.493 --> 00:51:38.929
AGAIN AND NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE

00:51:38.995 --> 00:51:39.529
OF THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE THERE

00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:40.497
TO GET TREATMENT.

00:51:40.564 --> 00:51:42.299
JUDGES HAVE THE DISCRETION NOW

00:51:42.365 --> 00:51:44.501
DO YOU HAVE THE DISCRETION NOW

00:51:44.568 --> 00:51:46.136
IN THE EXERCISE OF DISCRETION.

00:51:46.203 --> 00:51:47.871
REALLY ACTUALLY THE VERY YOU

00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:49.039
KNOW APPROPRIATELY MOST OF THE

00:51:49.105 --> 00:51:50.574
TIME NOT ALWAYS BUT MOST OF THE

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.242
TIME -- AND

00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:53.643
IT'S THIS KIND OF OFFENSE.

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:55.145
WHERE DISCRETION MAKES THE MOST

00:51:55.212 --> 00:51:56.379
SENSE BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUCH A

00:51:56.446 --> 00:51:57.981
WIDE VARIETY OF TYPES OF

00:51:58.048 --> 00:51:59.583
DEFENDANTS SUCH OPEN COURT?

00:51:59.649 --> 00:52:00.851
SO WE DO UNDERSTAND THERE ARE

00:52:00.917 --> 00:52:03.086
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A FELONY

00:52:03.153 --> 00:52:04.020
THIS CAN BE FOUND TO BE

00:52:04.087 --> 00:52:05.722
APPROPRIATE AND HAPPENS ALL THE

00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:07.257
TIME RIGHT NOW.

00:52:07.324 --> 00:52:08.892
SO THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF THAT

00:52:08.959 --> 00:52:10.427
THE DISCUSSION BE NEWS SO FOR

00:52:10.494 --> 00:52:11.962
THOSE REASONS.

00:52:12.028 --> 00:52:13.396
WERE OPPOSED WE WE DON'T NOT DO

00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:15.899
I THINK IT SHOULD BE MANDATORY

00:52:15.966 --> 00:52:17.234
SHOULD REMAIN.

SO FOR THOSE REASONS WERE

00:52:28.545 --> 00:52:28.745

THANK YOU MISTER FLORES SO I

HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I AND

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:55.238
FORTUNATELY --

00:52:55.305 --> 00:52:57.474
WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL

00:52:57.541 --> 00:52:58.074
FOR SOME OF THE REASONS THAT

00:52:58.141 --> 00:53:00.043
WERE STATED THINK UNDER CURRENT

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:01.578
LAW NOW --

00:53:01.645 --> 00:53:03.613
AFTER THE THIRD SORT OF OFFENSE

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.348
THE FOURTH CAN BE CONSIDERED A

00:53:05.415 --> 00:53:06.850
FELONY AND I THINK WITH THAT

00:53:06.917 --> 00:53:08.552
THERE IS TIME WITH THEM AS P.

00:53:08.618 --> 00:53:10.387
MANDATED STATE PRISON --

00:53:10.453 --> 00:53:12.088
BUT I DO WANT TO GO BACK TO SOME

00:53:12.155 --> 00:53:13.356
OF THE COMMENTS AROUND THE

00:53:13.423 --> 00:53:14.624
EMPOWERMENT IN THE SEIZURES OF

00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:16.259
THE CAR I ACTUALLY WONDER IF

00:53:16.326 --> 00:53:18.962
THIS IN FACT IS CONSTITUTIONAL.

00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:20.430
A RECENT SUPREME COURT HEARING

00:53:20.497 --> 00:53:22.999
TIM'S V. INDIANA.

00:53:23.066 --> 00:53:24.167
GREES WITH THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT

00:53:24.234 --> 00:53:25.035
WHICH SAYS YOU CANNOT HAVE

00:53:25.101 --> 00:53:26.703
EXCESSIVE SEIZURES --

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:29.039
AND THAT APPLIES TO FEDERAL LAW

00:53:29.105 --> 00:53:32.809
BUT ALSO TO STATES AS WELL --

00:53:32.876 --> 00:53:35.245
THERE'S NO SORT OF DISCRETION

00:53:35.312 --> 00:53:37.147
AROUND.

00:53:37.213 --> 00:53:39.649
HOW THAT TRANSPORTATION FITS

00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:41.151
INTO -- YEAH

00:53:41.217 --> 00:53:44.054
HOW FAMILIES ARE ABLE TO SURVIVE --

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.723
AND SO YOU KNOW SEIZING IT DOES

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:48.725
THE FAMILY HAVE ONE CAR IS THAT

00:53:48.792 --> 00:53:49.292
THEIR ONLY MODE OF

00:53:49.359 --> 00:53:51.328
TRANSPORTATION VERSES MULTIPLE

00:53:51.394 --> 00:53:53.563
CARS -- BUT

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:55.265
MY CONCERN HAS TO BE AROUND

00:53:55.332 --> 00:53:56.633
EXCESSIVE SEIZURES WE KNOW THAT

00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:57.901
30% OF THE SEIZURES HAPPEN IN

00:53:57.968 --> 00:53:59.002
BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES

00:53:59.069 --> 00:54:00.604
OFTENTIMES THEY'RE WORKING CLASS

00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:02.672
AND POOR COMMUNITIES --

00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:03.173
AND THIS IMPACT WOULD BE

00:54:03.239 --> 00:54:06.009
DEVASTATING --

00:54:06.076 --> 00:54:07.877
TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE SO WITH

00:54:07.944 --> 00:54:08.612
THAT -- I

00:54:08.678 --> 00:54:09.679
JUST WANTED TO REGISTER MY

00:54:09.746 --> 00:54:11.047
CONCERNS WITH THAT I DON'T KNOW

00:54:11.114 --> 00:54:11.881
IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT

00:54:11.948 --> 00:54:13.416
THE EXCESSIVE SEIZURE PORTION OF

00:54:13.483 --> 00:54:15.051
THIS BILL.

00:54:15.118 --> 00:54:16.386
SO YEAH WE'VE WE'VE LOOKED INTO

00:54:16.453 --> 00:54:17.787
THAT THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF IT

00:54:17.854 --> 00:54:18.955
AND ALL OF OUR PEOPLE WE'VE

00:54:19.022 --> 00:54:20.123
TALKED -- TO

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:21.558
IT IS CONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE

00:54:21.625 --> 00:54:23.526
PRIOR TO THIS THE SEIZURE OF THE

00:54:23.593 --> 00:54:24.995
VEHICLE THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO

00:54:25.061 --> 00:54:26.196
THROUGH A COURT OF LAW.

00:54:26.262 --> 00:54:27.297
THIS IS SOMETHING SO THEY WOULD

00:54:27.364 --> 00:54:29.199
HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT AND ONCE

00:54:29.265 --> 00:54:30.033
AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.235
SOMEONE WHO'S ON THEIR FIFTY WHY

00:54:32.302 --> 00:54:33.269
SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

00:54:33.336 --> 00:54:34.404
THEY COME INTO THE FIRST ONE AND

00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:35.538
WE'RE SEIZING IT THIS IS

00:54:35.605 --> 00:54:36.473
SOMETHING AFTER THE FIFTY WHY.

00:54:36.539 --> 00:54:37.440
AFTER YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THE

00:54:37.507 --> 00:54:39.442
JUDICIAL PROCESS THE JUDGE WOULD

00:54:39.509 --> 00:54:40.677
HAVE DISCRETION AT THAT POINT.

00:54:40.744 --> 00:54:42.612
SO BECAUSE OF THAT YOU KNOW WE

00:54:42.679 --> 00:54:43.446
DO BELIEVE.

00:54:43.513 --> 00:54:44.948
I'M SORRY JUDGE WOULD NOT HAVE

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:45.915
DISCRETION THAT POINT START

00:54:45.982 --> 00:54:47.917
PRIOR TO IN THE CURRENTLY HOW IS

00:54:47.984 --> 00:54:49.653
THE THE JUDGE WOULD HAVE

00:54:49.719 --> 00:54:50.754
DISCRETION WITH THIS --

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:51.888
WE WOULD MAKE IT MANDATORY

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:54.791
ABSOLUTELY BUT WE DO BELIEVE IT

00:54:54.858 --> 00:54:55.258
FALLS IN LINE WITH THE

00:54:55.325 --> 00:54:57.093
CONSTITUTION IS.

00:57:32.382 --> 00:57:35.118
AND IT WAS HIS DAUGHTER.

00:57:35.185 --> 00:57:37.587
HIS DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING.

00:57:37.654 --> 00:57:38.855
AT A PARTY THAT SHE WAS NOT

00:57:38.922 --> 00:57:40.790
SUPPOSED TO BE OUT.

00:57:40.857 --> 00:57:42.425
THE DRUNK DRIVER WAS EJECTED AND

00:57:42.492 --> 00:57:45.261
NON INJURED SEVEN OVER THERE.

00:57:45.328 --> 00:57:46.663
I DON'T KNOW HOW THE CAPTAIN

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:54.671
BUT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING

00:57:54.737 --> 00:57:56.239
ABOUT THAT DAUGHTER WILL NEVER

00:57:56.306 --> 00:57:58.141
BE THE SAME.

00:57:58.208 --> 00:57:58.641
SHE'S GOT DRAMATIC BRAIN

00:57:58.708 --> 00:58:00.476

00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:05.682
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HARDSHIPS

00:58:05.748 --> 00:58:08.084
I I WANT TO MAKE IT VERY VERY

00:58:08.151 --> 00:58:09.452

WE HAVE VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:52.814
IT AND WE NEED MORE TOOLS TO DO

THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE IT

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:38.620
IS DUPLICATIVE.

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:42.324
I FEEL LIKE WE ARE FIND TRYING

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:44.526
TO JIGSAW LAWS ON TOP OF EACH

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:47.262
OTHER TO SQUEEZE OUT.

01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:50.098
ANY KIND OF LIGHT POSSIBLE SO

01:17:50.165 --> 01:17:53.001
THAT WE CAN CONTINUE DOWN THE

01:17:53.068 --> 01:17:54.669
ROAD OF MASS INCARCERATION.

01:17:54.736 --> 01:17:57.039
IN THE GOAL IS NOT TO CREATE A

01:17:57.105 --> 01:17:59.441
NANNY STATE WHERE NO ONE HAS THE

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:02.344
ABILITY TO WALK OR LIVE FREE LEE

01:18:02.411 --> 01:18:03.678
THE GOAL IS ACTUALLY TO SET

01:18:03.745 --> 01:18:05.247
PARAMETERS SO PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO

01:18:05.313 --> 01:18:07.682
DO THAT WITHOUT BEING AFRAID OF

01:18:07.749 --> 01:18:09.251
LAW ENFORCEMENT WITHOUT BEING

01:18:09.317 --> 01:18:12.154
AFRAID OF PROSECUTORS WITHOUT

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:12.487
BEING AFRAID.

01:18:12.554 --> 01:18:13.622
OF THE D. A..

01:18:13.688 --> 01:18:15.357
AND WE'RE ACTUALLY MOVING DOWN

01:18:15.424 --> 01:18:17.292
THAT ROAD WHICH IS VERY

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:19.227
DANGEROUS I THINK THIS IS

01:18:19.294 --> 01:18:21.029
DUPLICATIVE I THINK IT IS OVER

01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:22.431
BURDENSOME I THINK IT

01:18:22.497 --> 01:18:24.499
COMPLICATES THINGS DRASTICALLY

01:18:24.566 --> 01:18:26.568
AND IT ALLOWS FOR FOLKS --

01:18:26.635 --> 01:18:29.137
WHO ARE PROSECUTING TO FIND MORE

01:18:29.204 --> 01:18:30.405
AND MORE WAYS TO PUT?

01:18:30.472 --> 01:18:31.973
VICTIMS IN JAIL BUT ALSO JUST

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.742
PUT PEOPLE WHO THEY DON'T LIKE

01:18:33.809 --> 01:18:36.445
OR DON'T UNDERSTAND INTO JAIL.

01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:38.447
FURTHER EXACERBATED MY CONCERNS

01:18:38.513 --> 01:18:40.615
BY SOME OF YOUR COMMENTS ARE

01:18:40.682 --> 01:18:43.385
SPECIALLY JURORS NOT NEEDING TO

01:18:43.452 --> 01:18:44.186
ASK THE QUESTION WHEN I HEAR

01:18:44.252 --> 01:18:45.153
THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.189
THAT TRANSLATES TO ME THE

01:18:47.255 --> 01:18:49.658
ERASURE OF DUE PROCESS --

01:18:49.724 --> 01:18:50.992
AND IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE

01:18:51.059 --> 01:18:52.461
PUNISHED UNIFORMLY FOR THE

01:18:52.527 --> 01:18:54.096
CRIMES THEY COMMIT.

01:18:54.162 --> 01:18:56.498
THE REALITY IS IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:59.167
FOLKS ARE PROSECUTED.

01:18:59.234 --> 01:19:01.837
BASED ON THE REPRESENTATION THAT

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:04.239
THEY'RE ABLE TO AFFORD IN SO WE

01:19:04.306 --> 01:19:06.241
HAVE TO GET TO A POINT WHERE THE

01:19:06.308 --> 01:19:09.444
BIAS AND THE PRIVILEGE IS TAKEN

01:19:09.511 --> 01:19:11.646
OUT OF THE REPRESENTATION THAT

01:19:11.713 --> 01:19:13.415
YOU'RE AFFORDED SO I HOPE THAT

01:19:13.482 --> 01:19:14.749
IN THIS PROCESS.

01:19:14.816 --> 01:19:17.018
THE AMENDMENTS ARE TAKEN AND

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:18.753
THAT THESE KINDS OF CONCERNS ARE

01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:20.655
REALLY LISTEN TO BECAUSE WE'RE

01:19:20.722 --> 01:19:22.691
CREATING A SITUATION WHERE.

01:19:22.757 --> 01:19:23.959
THE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:19:24.025 --> 01:19:25.293
INCARCERATED ARE GOING TO

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.696
CONTINUE TO BE INCARCERATED THIS

01:19:27.762 --> 01:19:29.030
IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE

01:19:29.097 --> 01:19:31.533
COMPLEXION OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.835

THAT THE TESTING IS TRULY

01:32:13.127 --> 01:32:14.462
NECESSARY.

01:32:14.528 --> 01:32:15.730
IN A CORRECTIONAL SETTING THE

INVOLUNTARY TESTING ARE

01:32:17.999 --> 01:32:18.799
HEIGHTENED.

01:32:18.866 --> 01:32:20.368
AN INMATE MAY HAVE VERY GOOD

01:32:20.434 --> 01:32:22.203
REASON TO REFUSE TESTING AS THE

SIMPLY ON THE BASIS HAVE BEEN

01:32:28.576 --> 01:32:30.278
KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN TESTED.

01:32:30.344 --> 01:32:31.846
EXISTING LAW BALANCES THESE

01:32:31.913 --> 01:32:33.214
IMPORTANT CONCERNS WITH THE

01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:34.882
RIGHTS OF CORRECTIONAL EMPLOYEES

01:32:34.949 --> 01:32:36.250

01:32:37.752 --> 01:32:40.521
GAS ATTACK OR OTHER CONTACT WITH

01:32:40.588 --> 01:32:41.889
AN INMATE'S BODILY FLUIDS.

01:32:41.956 --> 01:32:43.190
TITLE EIGHT OF PART THREE OF THE

01:32:43.257 --> 01:32:44.358
PENAL CODE BEGINNING WITH

01:32:44.425 --> 01:32:45.993
SECTION SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.194
REQUIRES REPORTING OF ANY

01:32:47.261 --> 01:32:49.030
INCIDENT IN WHICH AN OFFICER OR

01:32:49.096 --> 01:32:51.032
EMPLOYEE COMES INTO CONTACT WITH

01:32:51.098 --> 01:32:52.600
AN INMATE'S BODILY FLUIDS.

01:32:52.667 --> 01:32:54.101
ALLOWS THE OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE

01:32:54.168 --> 01:32:55.403
TO REQUEST TESTING OF THE IN

01:32:55.469 --> 01:32:57.505

01:32:57.571 --> 01:32:58.205
C..

01:32:58.272 --> 01:32:59.907
AND SETS OUT THE PROCEDURES AND

01:32:59.974 --> 01:33:01.475
STANDARDS BY WHICH THE DECISION

01:33:01.542 --> 01:33:02.944
WHETHER OR NOT TO ORDER TESTING

01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:04.412
MUST BE MADE.

01:33:04.478 --> 01:33:07.448
THE CHANGES PROPOSED IN AB TWO

01:33:07.515 --> 01:33:08.015
NINETY FOUR WITH REGARD TO

01:33:08.082 --> 01:33:09.784
TESTING AND REQUESTS FOR TESTING

01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:12.019
ARE SIMPLY NOT NECESSARY.

01:33:12.086 --> 01:33:12.653
AS THE OFFICERS ALREADY HAVE THE

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:15.556
RIGHT TO TESTING UNDER EXISTING

01:33:15.623 --> 01:33:16.257
LAW.

01:33:16.324 --> 01:33:17.792
AND THEY WILL CREATE CONFUSION

01:33:17.858 --> 01:33:19.160
ABOUT WHETHER AND HOW THE

01:33:19.226 --> 01:33:20.361
EXISTING PROVISIONS OF LAW

01:33:20.428 --> 01:33:22.697
REGARDING TESTING APPLY TO THE

01:33:22.763 --> 01:33:24.765
THE REQUEST THAT SEEM TO BE

01:33:24.832 --> 01:33:26.267
NEWLY AUTHORIZED UNDER.

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:28.135
THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL.

01:33:28.202 --> 01:33:29.437
WE WOULD ASK THAT THE BILL BE

01:33:29.503 --> 01:33:31.205
AMENDED TO REMOVE THE LANGUAGE

01:33:31.272 --> 01:33:33.207
OF SECTION TWO FORTY THREE POINT

01:33:33.274 --> 01:33:35.209
NINE C. THREE WHICH THAT'S WHAT

01:33:35.276 --> 01:33:37.144
WHICH STATES THE OFFICERS RIGHT

01:33:37.211 --> 01:33:38.713
TO REQUEST TESTING AS WE BELIEVE

01:33:38.779 --> 01:33:40.214
THAT IS DUPLICATIVE OF EXISTING

01:33:40.281 --> 01:33:42.383
LAW. TO RESTORE THE EXISTING

01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:44.185
LANGUAGE OF SECTION TWO FORTY

01:33:44.251 --> 01:33:45.786
THREE POINT NINE C. TOO SO THAT

01:33:45.853 --> 01:33:47.254
IT CONTINUES TO REFER TO

01:33:47.321 --> 01:33:49.023
HEPATITIS AND TUBERCULOSIS

01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:52.326
WITHOUT HIV BECAUSE HIV TESTING

01:33:52.393 --> 01:33:54.962
IS COVERED UNDER SECTION SEVENTY

THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER

01:34:09.777 --> 01:34:13.914
WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

01:34:13.981 --> 01:34:15.383
MARGOT GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA

01:34:15.449 --> 01:34:17.618
PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION

01:34:17.685 --> 01:34:19.153
WANNA THANK THE OFFER FOR THE

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:20.988
AMENDMENTS AND WE'RE WITHDRAWING

01:34:21.055 --> 01:34:21.622
OUR OPPOSITION.

01:34:21.689 --> 01:34:25.393
THANK YOU.

01:34:25.459 --> 01:34:27.228
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR

01:34:27.294 --> 01:34:30.564
COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS

01:34:30.631 --> 01:34:30.865
[inaudible]

01:34:30.931 --> 01:34:31.132
MR QUIRK.

01:34:31.198 --> 01:34:32.133
WHAT AT FIRST OF ALL I AM VOTING

01:34:32.199 --> 01:34:33.601
FOR THE BELL BUT I DO WANT TO

01:34:33.667 --> 01:34:34.402
KNOW?

01:34:34.468 --> 01:34:36.137
WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THE

01:34:36.203 --> 01:34:37.638
PROCEDURE.

01:34:37.705 --> 01:34:39.373
AND WHY DO YOU HAVE CONCERNS

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:42.510
ABOUT IT.

01:34:42.576 --> 01:34:44.211
SO I I WILL SAY THAT I THINK

01:34:44.278 --> 01:34:45.980
THAT EVEN EXISTING LAW IS

01:34:46.047 --> 01:34:50.217
SOMEWHAT CONFUSING BECAUSE THERE

01:34:50.284 --> 01:34:53.687
IS A SECTION TWO FORTY THREE

01:34:53.754 --> 01:34:55.089
POINT NINE WHICH THE BILL AMENDS

01:34:55.156 --> 01:34:58.426
WHICH MAKES PROVISION FOR TAX

01:34:58.492 --> 01:34:59.927
FOR INVOLUNTARY TESTING.

01:34:59.994 --> 01:35:02.496
WHEN SOMEONE IS THE VICTIM OF A

01:35:02.563 --> 01:35:05.199
GASSING ATTACK WITH TESTING FOR

01:35:05.266 --> 01:35:07.334
HEPATITIS OR TUBERCULOSIS AND

01:35:07.401 --> 01:35:10.471
SETS OUT WHAT THE PROCEDURES ARE --

01:35:10.538 --> 01:35:12.039
FOR FOR MAKING THAT DECISION AND

01:35:12.106 --> 01:35:14.141
AN IMPOSING THAT TESTING AND

01:35:14.208 --> 01:35:15.342
THEN THERE'S THE SEPARATE FOR IT

01:35:15.409 --> 01:35:17.111
AND THERE'S THE STATEMENT IN

01:35:17.178 --> 01:35:18.446
THAT PROVISION THAT SAYS.

01:35:18.512 --> 01:35:19.680
NOTHING IN THIS SUBDIVISION

01:35:19.747 --> 01:35:21.882
SHALL BE CONSTRUED THE THE

01:35:21.949 --> 01:35:23.417
OPERATION OF TITLE EIGHT

01:35:23.484 --> 01:35:26.987
COMMENCING WITH SECTION. SEVENTY

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:28.222
FIVE HUNDRED I AM UNCERTAIN

01:35:28.289 --> 01:35:30.224
FRANKLY HOW THOSE TWO PROVISIONS

01:35:30.291 --> 01:35:32.493
OF LAW OPERATE NOW BUT I THINK

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.028
ADDING TO THAT.

01:35:34.095 --> 01:35:35.996
HIV TESTING UNDER TO FORTY THREE

01:35:36.063 --> 01:35:39.266
POINT.

01:35:39.333 --> 01:35:40.501
NINE CREATES FURTHER CONFUSION

01:35:40.568 --> 01:35:42.303
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED SPECIFICALLY

01:35:42.369 --> 01:35:44.071
IN THE CASE OF HIV TESTING AND

01:35:44.138 --> 01:35:47.508
THEN ADDING THE THE STATEMENT OF

01:35:47.575 --> 01:35:49.043
THAT THE OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE

01:35:49.110 --> 01:35:50.544
SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO REQUEST

01:35:50.611 --> 01:35:53.614
THE IN MAY BE TESTED --

01:35:53.681 --> 01:35:55.816
IT IT LEAVES IT UNCLEAR AS TO

01:35:55.883 --> 01:35:57.017
WHETHER THAT RIGHT TO REQUEST

01:35:57.084 --> 01:35:59.720
TESTING IS SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF

01:35:59.787 --> 01:36:01.222
THE EXISTING PROVISIONS --

01:36:01.288 --> 01:36:02.790
REGARDING PROCEDURES FOR SUCH A

01:36:02.857 --> 01:36:04.725
REQUEST OKAY SO I STRONGLY

01:36:04.792 --> 01:36:06.093
SUPPORT YOUR BILL MISTER

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:07.194
RODRIGUEZ.

01:36:07.261 --> 01:36:09.864
JUDGES CAN DO STRANGE THINGS.

01:36:09.930 --> 01:36:11.799
SO IT'S PROBABLY BEST YOU WORK

01:36:11.866 --> 01:36:14.068
WITH YOUR TECHNICAL EXPERTS

01:36:14.135 --> 01:36:17.171
BECAUSE IF AREN'T THE ACLU SEES

01:36:17.238 --> 01:36:19.006
THAT THERE'S SOME AMBIGUITY A

01:36:19.073 --> 01:36:20.474
JUDGE MIGHT SEE IT.

01:36:20.541 --> 01:36:22.109
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IF YOU

01:36:22.176 --> 01:36:23.644
GAS SOMEBODY YOU LOSE YOUR RIGHT

01:36:23.711 --> 01:36:25.112
TO PRIVACY I DON'T KNOW THAT THE

01:36:25.179 --> 01:36:26.914
ACLU WOULD SUPPORT ME ON THAT

01:36:26.981 --> 01:36:30.751
BUT I THINK THAT'S VERY SIMPLE.

01:36:30.818 --> 01:36:31.619
THERE MAY BE REASONS YOU CAN'T

01:36:31.685 --> 01:36:32.987
PUT IT THAT WAY BECAUSE OF

01:36:33.053 --> 01:36:34.355
SOMETHING OR OTHER IN OUR

01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:36.991
CONSTITUTION BUT IT PROBABLY

01:36:37.057 --> 01:36:38.459
HELPS TO SIMPLIFY.

01:36:38.526 --> 01:36:41.195
ARE IN SOME WAY AND AS YOU GO ON

01:36:41.262 --> 01:36:42.596
FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT BELL I

01:36:42.663 --> 01:36:46.467
JUST URGE YOU TO LOOK AT THAT

01:36:46.534 --> 01:36:46.734
THANK YOU.

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:48.702
THANK YOU.

01:36:48.769 --> 01:36:49.670
QUESTIONS MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE SO

01:36:49.737 --> 01:36:51.038
I TO WILL BE SUPPORTING --

01:36:51.105 --> 01:36:54.708
THE BILL I JUST HOPE THAT --

01:36:54.775 --> 01:36:57.878
IN THE PROCESS OF HOPEFULLY THIS

01:36:57.945 --> 01:36:59.547
AND MAYBE NOT OTHER BILLS MOVING

01:36:59.613 --> 01:37:01.282
FORWARD THAT THERE'S ALSO SOME

01:37:01.348 --> 01:37:03.317
CONSIDERATION GIVEN AROUND WHAT

01:37:03.384 --> 01:37:05.052
HAPPENS AFTER TESTING HAPPENS

01:37:05.119 --> 01:37:06.086
BECAUSE I WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE

01:37:06.153 --> 01:37:08.455
CONCERNS OF FOLKS ARE TESTED FOR

01:37:08.522 --> 01:37:10.624
HIV OR SOME OTHER --

01:37:10.691 --> 01:37:11.125
DISEASE AND THEN THERE'S

01:37:11.192 --> 01:37:13.460
RETALIATES THERE'S FURTHER

01:37:13.527 --> 01:37:15.763
DISCRIMINATION OR STIGMATISATION

01:37:15.829 --> 01:37:17.198
AS IT RELATES TO YOU KNOW SOME

01:37:17.264 --> 01:37:18.532
OF THE THINGS THAT MIGHT BE

01:37:18.599 --> 01:37:20.000
REVEALED FROM THE TESTING.

01:37:20.067 --> 01:37:21.302
IF THEY'RE ALREADY VOLATILE

01:37:21.368 --> 01:37:23.037
UNSTABLE.

01:37:23.103 --> 01:37:26.574
FACILITIES AND EXACERBATING THAT

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:28.108
WITH SOME ADDITIONAL.

01:37:28.175 --> 01:37:30.277
DRAMA BECAUSE OF SOME RESULTS OF

01:37:30.344 --> 01:37:31.645
A TEST --

01:37:31.712 --> 01:37:32.813
YOU KNOW COULD KIND OF

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:34.648
XCELERATED EXACERBATE AN ALREADY

01:37:34.715 --> 01:37:35.916
UNSTABLE --

01:37:35.983 --> 01:37:37.551
SITUATION SO WHY WOULD HER HOPE

01:37:37.618 --> 01:37:38.586
THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME THOUGHT

01:37:38.652 --> 01:37:40.354
GIVEN TO KIND OF THE AFTERMATH

01:37:40.421 --> 01:37:41.455
OF TESTING BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:42.590
CERTAINLY TRYING TO PREVENT.

01:37:42.656 --> 01:37:45.259
GAS THINGS FROM HAPPENING BUT

01:37:45.326 --> 01:37:46.660
YOU KNOW.

01:37:46.727 --> 01:37:48.195
SQUARELY THINGS HAPPEN IN THOSE

01:37:48.262 --> 01:37:50.130
FACILITIES ONCE FOLKS HAVE

01:37:50.197 --> 01:37:52.233
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

01:37:52.299 --> 01:37:53.867
THE FEMALE LOOK AT AS WELL THANK

01:37:53.934 --> 01:37:54.735
YOU THANK YOU.

01:37:54.802 --> 01:37:56.937
MISTER CHAIR I THINK ONE OF THE

01:37:57.004 --> 01:37:58.072
WITNESSES HAS --

01:37:58.138 --> 01:38:00.941
CAN PERHAPS ELUCIDATE WHAT THE

01:38:01.008 --> 01:38:03.110
CURRENT PROCEDURES ARE.

01:38:03.177 --> 01:38:04.278
I MEAN.

01:38:04.345 --> 01:38:05.012
FIRST OF ALL THE INVADERS

01:38:05.079 --> 01:38:07.147
PROTECT FIRST OF ALL THE INMATE

01:38:07.214 --> 01:38:08.716
IS PROTECTED BY.

01:38:08.782 --> 01:38:10.150
THE RULES OF HIP.

01:38:10.217 --> 01:38:12.786
SO IF THEY DO GET TESTED IT

01:38:12.853 --> 01:38:13.887
BECOMES PART OF THEIR MEDICAL

01:38:13.954 --> 01:38:15.289
RECORD.

01:38:15.356 --> 01:38:17.324
AND HIS.

01:38:17.391 --> 01:38:18.025
HELD CONFIDENTIAL.

01:38:18.092 --> 01:38:22.730
WITHIN --

01:38:22.796 --> 01:38:25.733
I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT RELATES TO

01:38:25.799 --> 01:38:27.368
LEADING THE VICTIM NO.

01:38:27.434 --> 01:38:30.838
BUT IT CERTAINLY --

01:38:30.904 --> 01:38:32.806
IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T

01:38:32.873 --> 01:38:33.107
[inaudible]

01:38:33.173 --> 01:38:34.942
DOESN'T.

01:38:35.009 --> 01:38:37.711
PUT THE VICTIMS AND HEALTH

01:38:37.778 --> 01:38:38.646
RECORD.

01:38:38.712 --> 01:38:41.282
OUT IN THE GENERAL POPULATION OF

01:38:41.348 --> 01:38:42.549
THE INMATES IT DOESN'T.

01:38:42.616 --> 01:38:47.788
I DON'T SEE THAT AS BEING AN

01:38:47.855 --> 01:38:52.426
ADDED IMPAIRMENT TO THE IN MAY --

01:38:52.493 --> 01:38:53.494
IT'S GENERALLY HELD

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:56.697
CONFIDENTIALLY AND RETALIATION.

01:38:56.764 --> 01:38:59.466
BY THE INMATE POPULATION IS NOT

01:38:59.533 --> 01:39:01.402
AN ISSUE.

01:39:01.468 --> 01:39:02.803
RETALIATION BY.

01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:04.638
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS SOMETHING

01:39:04.705 --> 01:39:06.907
THAT WE TRAIN AGAINST ALL THE

01:39:06.974 --> 01:39:07.675
TIME.

01:39:07.741 --> 01:39:10.044
AND WOULD DO VERY WELL WITH THAT

01:39:10.110 --> 01:39:12.780
IN CORCORAN STATE PRISON.

01:39:12.846 --> 01:39:14.748
AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT IT'S NOT

01:39:14.815 --> 01:39:17.951
AN ISSUE [inaudible]

01:39:18.018 --> 01:39:19.787
YES.

01:39:19.853 --> 01:39:20.754
ANY OTHER.

01:39:20.821 --> 01:39:22.823
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS.

I I KNOW HOW SERIOUS.

01:39:45.946 --> 01:39:47.314
THIS IS --

01:39:47.381 --> 01:39:49.216
ALSO THE THE DISCUSSION WHICH I

01:39:49.283 --> 01:39:50.718
THOUGHT WOULD BE.

01:39:50.784 --> 01:39:52.152
PART OF THE LABOR NEGOTIATION

01:39:52.219 --> 01:39:53.954

THAT'S SOMETHING YOU DO IN

01:40:00.394 --> 01:40:02.596
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.

I DID.

01:40:04.531 --> 01:40:05.933
IT WAS MENTIONED TO ME EARLIER.

01:40:05.999 --> 01:40:08.202
THAT THAT WAS IN THAT WAS AN

01:40:08.268 --> 01:40:10.471
ISSUE WHICH IS UNFATHOMABLE TO

01:40:10.537 --> 01:40:13.107
ME THAT YOU WOULD NOT WORK VERY

01:40:13.173 --> 01:40:14.475
HARD TO GET.

01:40:14.541 --> 01:40:16.377
SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN GAS --

01:40:16.443 --> 01:40:18.412
A NEW UNIFORM AND MAYBE THERE'S

01:40:18.479 --> 01:40:20.214
SOMETHING IN THERE THAT --

01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:22.383

THAT THAT ONE ACTUALLY DID MAKE

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:29.056
ANY SENSE TO ME WHICH IS WHY.

01:40:29.123 --> 01:40:30.324
WE NEED.

01:40:30.391 --> 01:40:31.825
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PERSON

01:40:31.892 --> 01:40:35.696
THAT'S GETS GAS THAT WE MAKE

01:40:35.763 --> 01:40:37.064

01:40:37.131 --> 01:40:38.766
THAT WE DO WHATEVER TESTING WE

NEED TO DO TO ENSURE THAT I

01:40:40.834 --> 01:40:41.969
BELIEVE.

01:40:42.035 --> 01:40:43.904
THAT THE THE MEMBERS AND THE

01:40:43.971 --> 01:40:47.474
ACLU ARE CONCERNED NOT ONLY --

01:40:47.541 --> 01:40:49.076

I WANTED TO APPLY WHEN I WAS

MY EXPERIENCE ON PAROLE LIMITED

01:45:12.472 --> 01:45:13.774
ME FROM GOALS.

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:15.042
THERE WERE MANY TIMES THAT I WAS

01:53:59.365 --> 01:54:00.733
NON VIOLENT OFFENSE.

01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:02.468
IN ADDITION THERE ARE WELL OVER

01:54:02.535 --> 01:54:03.803
ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND

NOT ON PAROLE BUT WHO ARE ONE

01:54:09.075 --> 01:54:09.909
STEP AWAY.

01:54:09.976 --> 01:54:11.644
FROM A CONVICTION NOT FOR

01:54:11.711 --> 01:54:13.680
ANOTHER SEX OFFENSE BECAUSE

01:54:13.746 --> 01:54:15.815
THEY'RE RE OFFENSE RATE FOR

01:54:15.882 --> 01:54:17.350
SOMEBODY TO COME ANOTHER SEX

01:54:17.417 --> 01:54:19.953
OFFENSE WHILE ON PAROLE IS LESS

01:54:20.019 --> 01:54:21.187
THAN 1%.

01:54:21.254 --> 01:54:22.822
AND THAT IS A STATISTIC FROM CDC

01:54:22.889 --> 01:54:24.224
ARE IT'S NOT MY PERSONAL OPINION

01:54:24.290 --> 01:54:25.725
IT'S NOT THE PERSONAL OPINION OF

01:54:25.792 --> 01:54:28.328
THE ORGANIZATION THIS IS CD CDC

01:54:28.394 --> 01:54:30.830
OUR STATISTICS.

01:54:30.897 --> 01:54:32.232
ARE THE CURRENT OUR BILL

01:54:32.298 --> 01:54:33.866
LANGUAGE ALSO WE BELIEVE WOULD

01:54:33.933 --> 01:54:36.269
NOT SURVIVE JUDICIAL SCRUTINY --

01:54:36.336 --> 01:54:38.304
ANTACID STAFF HAS --

01:54:38.371 --> 01:54:40.573
STATED VERY WELL A PAGE SEVEN OF

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:42.275
THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS --

01:54:42.342 --> 01:54:43.476
THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH EQUAL

01:54:43.543 --> 01:54:45.545
PROTECTION CLAUSE SO AND UNDER

01:54:45.612 --> 01:54:49.148
THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE --

01:54:49.215 --> 01:54:50.416
IT DEMANDS THAT LIKE THINGS BE

01:54:50.483 --> 01:54:51.918
TREATED ALIKE SO IN THIS

01:54:51.985 --> 01:54:53.152
SITUATION PEARL THEY SHOULD BE

01:54:53.219 --> 01:54:54.654
TREATED ALIKE AND IT DOESN'T

01:54:54.721 --> 01:54:55.855
MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHETHER OR

01:54:55.922 --> 01:54:56.956
NOT THEY'VE BEEN CONVICTED OF A

01:54:57.023 --> 01:54:58.157
SEX OFFENSE AGAIN.

01:54:58.224 --> 01:54:59.626
I MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED FIFTY

01:54:59.692 --> 01:55:01.060
YEARS AGO WE HAVE PEOPLE ONOUR

01:55:01.127 --> 01:55:02.428
SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY WHO'S BEEN

01:55:02.495 --> 01:55:03.830
THERE FOR MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS

01:55:03.896 --> 01:55:05.231
I PERSONALLY AWARE OF SOME OF

01:55:05.298 --> 01:55:06.699
THOSE INDIVIDUALS.

01:55:06.766 --> 01:55:08.835
SO THE ALSO THE LAWS --

01:55:08.901 --> 01:55:09.469
NGUYEN.

01:55:09.535 --> 01:55:10.970
THINGS ONE LIKE THINGS ARE NOT

01:55:11.037 --> 01:55:12.472
BEING TREATED ALIKE THE WAY THE

01:55:12.538 --> 01:55:15.608
pIS THERE A RATIONAL BASIS THE

01:55:15.675 --> 01:55:17.176
FACT IS THERE IS NO RATIONAL

01:55:17.243 --> 01:55:19.078
BASIS FOR THIS DISTINCTION --

01:55:19.145 --> 01:55:20.580
BECAUSE AS I SAID THE RATE OF RE

01:55:20.647 --> 01:55:22.548
OFFENSE FOR A SEX OFFENDER IS

01:55:22.615 --> 01:55:24.751
LOW ON PAROLE IS LESS THAN 1%

01:55:24.817 --> 01:55:27.287
AGAIN A CDC ARE STATISTIC AND

01:55:27.353 --> 01:55:28.921
NOT MY PERSONAL OPINION.

01:55:28.988 --> 01:55:31.090
I'M IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT

01:55:31.157 --> 01:55:32.191

01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:39.332

01:58:35.274 --> 01:58:37.343
IT SEEMS BOTH COUNTER INTUITIVE

01:58:37.410 --> 01:58:39.412

LAST TIME ON SUPERVISION MEANS

01:58:56.195 --> 01:58:57.763
THAT IT IS LESS LIKELY THAT A

MR QUIRK --

02:01:27.647 --> 02:01:29.815
SO I UNDERSTAND THE POSITION OF

02:01:29.882 --> 02:01:31.450
THE ALLIANCE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL

02:01:31.517 --> 02:01:32.918

02:01:58.511 --> 02:02:01.881

02:05:35.661 --> 02:05:37.229

02:06:52.805 --> 02:06:53.172
TO HELP.

02:06:53.238 --> 02:06:55.007
AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE WHICH

02:06:55.074 --> 02:06:56.442
IS WHAT THIS DONE.

02:06:56.508 --> 02:07:00.379
AND IN LASTLY --

02:07:00.446 --> 02:07:00.913
I WANT TO SET THE RECORD

02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:01.747
STRAIGHT.

02:07:01.814 --> 02:07:05.451
AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHO ASKED

02:07:05.517 --> 02:07:06.919
FOR THE AUDIT.

02:07:06.986 --> 02:07:09.755
OF CDC OUR PROGRAMS LET'S MAKE

02:07:09.822 --> 02:07:10.756
IT VERY CLEAR.

02:07:10.823 --> 02:07:13.826
THE PURPOSE OF IT WAS ONE TO

02:07:13.892 --> 02:07:15.494
FIND OUT OF CDC ARE.

02:07:15.561 --> 02:07:17.496
COULD QUANTIFY HOW EFFECTIVE IT

02:07:17.563 --> 02:07:18.397
IS.

02:07:18.464 --> 02:07:20.866
DAY THEIR PROGRAMS ARE.

02:07:20.933 --> 02:07:22.001
ONE MAYBE THE PROS ARE HAFTER

02:07:22.067 --> 02:07:24.837
PROGRAMS DIDN'T HAVE A MECHANISM

02:07:24.903 --> 02:07:25.838
TO TO DETERMINE WHETHER NOT THEY

02:07:25.904 --> 02:07:27.573
WERE EFFECTIVE OR NOT AND THOSE

02:07:27.639 --> 02:07:28.874
ARE ONCE THEY KIND OF SLAM.

02:07:28.941 --> 02:07:30.209
BUT THE COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR IN

02:07:30.275 --> 02:07:34.847
SOME OF THEY GOT HIGH MARKS ON

02:07:34.913 --> 02:07:36.749
STILL NEEDS SOME WORK TO DO TO

02:07:36.815 --> 02:07:38.050
BE ABLE TO SHOW THEIR

02:07:38.117 --> 02:07:39.351
EFFECTIVENESS AND THAT WAS A

02:07:39.418 --> 02:07:40.786
REAL PURPOSE.

02:07:40.853 --> 02:07:42.855
OF THE AUDIT NOT TO SLAM CDC ARE

02:07:42.921 --> 02:07:44.857
NOT.

02:07:44.923 --> 02:07:46.158
TO SAY THAT THEY DON'T DO IT

02:07:46.225 --> 02:07:47.559
CORRECTLY.

02:07:47.626 --> 02:07:49.194
BUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO FIND

02:07:49.261 --> 02:07:51.663
OUT WHICH PROGRAMS ACTUALLY WORK

02:07:51.730 --> 02:07:52.197
AND WHICH ONES WE NEED TO

02:07:52.264 --> 02:07:53.232
IMPROVE.

02:07:53.298 --> 02:07:54.800
ME SAY THAT ONE MORE TIME.

02:07:54.867 --> 02:07:56.068
IT WAS TO FIND OUT WHICH

02:07:56.135 --> 02:07:57.569
PROGRAMS WORKED SO WE CAN

02:07:57.636 --> 02:07:59.104
CONTINUE THOSE AND THEN WHICH

02:07:59.171 --> 02:08:01.607
ONES NEEDED IMPROVEMENT SO WE

02:08:01.673 --> 02:08:03.142
CONTINUE CONTINUE THOSE.

02:08:03.208 --> 02:08:05.244
AND IF THERE WAS SOME THAT AFTER

02:08:05.310 --> 02:08:06.678
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND MONEY.

02:08:06.745 --> 02:08:08.480
THAT THEY DIDN'T WORK WE WOULD

02:08:08.547 --> 02:08:10.249
LET THEM GO BY THE WAYSIDE AND

02:08:10.315 --> 02:08:12.551
SO THIS THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF

02:08:12.618 --> 02:08:14.420
REHABILITATION WE WANT TO MAKE

02:08:14.486 --> 02:08:15.988
SURE THAT IS THE BEST NOT ONLY

02:08:16.055 --> 02:08:17.589
CALIFORNIA BUT BEST IN THE

02:08:17.656 --> 02:08:18.590
COUNTRY AND HOPE FOR THE BEST IN

02:08:18.657 --> 02:08:19.224
THE WORLD.

02:08:19.291 --> 02:08:22.528
THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE

02:08:22.594 --> 02:08:25.931
AUDIT NOT TO SLAM CDC ARE.

02:08:25.998 --> 02:08:27.332
AND AND TO MOVE FORWARD THERE

02:08:27.399 --> 02:08:28.534
WILL BE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:29.568
DOLLARS BE POURED INTO

02:08:29.635 --> 02:08:31.570
REHABILITATION THIS IS WHY THIS

02:08:31.637 --> 02:08:32.838
IS SO IMPORTANT.

02:08:32.905 --> 02:08:34.406
BECAUSE THE REHABILITATION

02:08:34.473 --> 02:08:36.341
PROGRAMS WILL IMPROVE AND CDC

02:08:36.408 --> 02:08:36.809
ARC.

02:08:36.875 --> 02:08:39.278
AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

02:08:39.344 --> 02:08:41.513
ADDRESS ALL THE CONCERNS.

02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:48.353
EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE IN STAN --

02:08:48.420 --> 02:08:49.855
THEY HAVE A SPECIAL TREATMENT

02:08:49.922 --> 02:08:51.156
THAT THEY NEED THAT'S DIFFERENT

02:08:51.223 --> 02:08:53.125
FROM A REGULAR INMATE AND WE

02:08:53.192 --> 02:08:54.726
NEED TO ADDRESS THAT ALSO

02:08:54.793 --> 02:08:56.929
BECAUSE THAT'S WHY WHEN THEY

02:08:56.995 --> 02:08:57.496
LEAVE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT

02:08:57.563 --> 02:08:58.664
PROBATION.

02:08:58.730 --> 02:08:59.665
THEY CAN'T THEY CAN'T LIVE

02:08:59.731 --> 02:09:01.033
ANYWHERE THEY WANT THERE'S JUST

02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:02.968
DIFFERENT AND SO WE NEED TO TAKE

02:09:03.035 --> 02:09:04.503
THAT ALL IN CONSIDERATION AS MR

02:09:04.570 --> 02:09:06.138

02:09:06.205 --> 02:09:07.139

WE NEED TO TAKE ALL OF THAT IN

02:09:08.607 --> 02:09:10.709
CONSIDERATION SO THAT WE CAN GET

02:09:10.776 --> 02:09:11.777

CALIFORNIA.

02:13:56.828 --> 02:13:58.530

02:14:29.795 --> 02:14:31.096

02:14:31.163 --> 02:14:32.964

BUT WE'RE DOING A BETTER GUN OUT

02:16:51.736 --> 02:16:53.305
GUNNERS CALIFORNIANS AND I

02:16:53.371 --> 02:16:55.206
ACTUALLY HAD.

02:16:55.273 --> 02:16:56.041
TO WRITE THIS ONE DOWN TO MAKE

02:16:56.107 --> 02:17:01.846
SURE I AM IN OUR OUR POINTS --

02:17:01.913 --> 02:17:03.415
WE WE OPPOSE A G. R. FIVE FOR

02:17:03.481 --> 02:17:05.383
THE SAME REASON THAT --

02:17:05.450 --> 02:17:07.319
WE OPPOSED A BIASED AND

02:17:07.385 --> 02:17:08.653
POLITICIZED RESEARCH.

02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:10.388
OFTEN IT'S ANOTHER NEITHER

02:17:10.455 --> 02:17:12.157
FACTUAL OR SINCERE IN ITS

02:17:12.223 --> 02:17:14.960
JUSTIFICATION CALIFORNIA HAS.

02:17:15.026 --> 02:17:16.895
A G. R. FIVE NOTES HAS SOME OF

02:17:16.962 --> 02:17:18.563
THE MOST EXTENSIVE AN INTRUSIVE

02:17:18.630 --> 02:17:20.065
GUN CONTROL LAWS IN THE COUNTRY.

02:17:20.131 --> 02:17:21.366
AND YET THOSE LAWS OF FAILED TO

02:17:21.433 --> 02:17:23.101
PREVENT MASS MURDERS AND ACTS OF

02:17:23.168 --> 02:17:24.603
TERRORISM COMMITTED BY EVIL

02:17:24.669 --> 02:17:26.838
PEOPLE ASKING CONGRESS TO USE.

02:17:26.905 --> 02:17:28.239
THE EXAMPLE OF CALIFORNIA GUN

02:17:28.306 --> 02:17:30.141
LAWS AS A TEMPLATE FOR FEDERAL

02:17:30.208 --> 02:17:32.644
LAWS WOULD GUARANTEE THE SAME

02:17:32.711 --> 02:17:34.412
FAILURES ON A NATIONWIDE BASIS.

02:17:34.479 --> 02:17:36.448
A JUROR FIVE DECLARES THAT THE

02:17:36.514 --> 02:17:39.384
RATE OF GUN YEARS AT A RATE

02:17:39.451 --> 02:17:39.985
FASTER THAN THE REST OF THE

02:17:40.051 --> 02:17:40.819
COUNTRY.

02:17:40.885 --> 02:17:42.220
AND ATTRIBUTES THAT TO GUN

02:17:42.287 --> 02:17:43.888
CONTROL LAWS THE RESOLUTION

02:17:43.955 --> 02:17:45.624
FAILS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CRIME

02:17:45.690 --> 02:17:47.058
RATES BEGAN TO DROP.

02:17:47.125 --> 02:17:48.460
WHEN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTED

02:17:48.526 --> 02:17:50.261
STRONG PENALTIES FOR VIOLENT

02:17:50.328 --> 02:17:52.864
CRIMES WITH LONGER SENTENCES NO

02:17:52.931 --> 02:17:54.866
ONE DISPUTES THAT A SMALL

02:17:54.933 --> 02:17:56.368
PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION?

02:17:56.434 --> 02:17:58.403
ACCOUNT FOR MOST OF THE GUN

02:17:58.470 --> 02:18:00.171
DEBTS IN THE STATE.

02:18:00.238 --> 02:18:01.606
AFTER SUICIDE.

02:18:01.673 --> 02:18:02.774
AND IT STANDS TO REASON THAT IF

02:18:02.841 --> 02:18:04.709
YOU INCARCERATE THOSE WHO HAVE

02:18:04.776 --> 02:18:05.877
COMMITTED VIOLENT CRIMES AND

02:18:05.944 --> 02:18:07.212
KEEP THEM OFF THE STREETS.

02:18:07.278 --> 02:18:09.347
THE VIOLENT CRIME WILL GO DOWN

02:18:09.414 --> 02:18:10.749
IN RECENT YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS

02:18:10.815 --> 02:18:13.418
UNFORTUNATELY RIZ REVERSED THAT

02:18:13.485 --> 02:18:15.053
TREND OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS.

02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:16.588
AND IS NOW REDUCING --

02:18:16.655 --> 02:18:19.324
PENALTIES AND AND SENSES EVEN

02:18:19.391 --> 02:18:21.059
FOR VIOLENT OFFENDERS WHO USE A

02:18:21.126 --> 02:18:22.293
GUN TO COMMIT THEIR CRIMES NOT

02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:23.695
SURPRISINGLY.

02:18:23.762 --> 02:18:25.463
THE SAME CENTER FOR DISEASE

02:18:25.530 --> 02:18:27.365
CONTROL REPORT QUOTED IN THE

02:18:27.432 --> 02:18:29.200
RESOLUTION STATES THAT CRIMINAL

02:18:29.267 --> 02:18:30.101
GUN DEBTS.

02:18:30.168 --> 02:18:32.303
ARE ON THE RISE IN THE LAST TWO

02:18:32.370 --> 02:18:34.372
YEARS HERE IN THE STATE OF

02:18:34.439 --> 02:18:35.173
CALIFORNIA.

02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:36.574
A SINCE THE LEGISLATURE

02:18:36.641 --> 02:18:38.443
IMPLEMENTED EARLY RELEASE --

02:18:38.510 --> 02:18:40.211
TYPE POLICIES SO IT'S FOR THESE

02:18:40.278 --> 02:18:42.614
IN AN AND OTHER REASONS THAT WE

02:18:42.681 --> 02:18:44.416
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES THIS

02:18:44.482 --> 02:18:46.518
RESEARCH --

02:18:46.584 --> 02:18:47.886
A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR

02:18:47.952 --> 02:18:49.387
THE RECORD AND RE WITH NATIONAL

02:18:49.454 --> 02:18:52.424
RIGHT SO SEE XIN IN OPPOSITION --

02:18:52.490 --> 02:18:53.324
I BROUGHT.

02:18:53.391 --> 02:18:54.392
OUR CALIFORNIA GUN LAWS BOOK

02:18:54.459 --> 02:18:55.593
HERE THIS WAS DRAFTED BUYER

02:18:55.660 --> 02:18:57.328
ATTORNEYS IT'S OVER SIX HUNDRED

02:18:57.395 --> 02:18:58.697
PAGES.

02:18:58.763 --> 02:19:00.565
AND IT DOESN'T COVER EVERYTHING

02:19:00.632 --> 02:19:03.168
BEING A GUN --

02:19:03.234 --> 02:19:04.602
AND I GET CALLS AND I KNOW MY

02:19:04.669 --> 02:19:05.970
COLLEAGUES HERE GET CALLS EVERY

02:19:06.037 --> 02:19:09.240
WEEK. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:19:09.307 --> 02:19:10.508
CONFUSED ON HOW TO COMPLY WITH

02:19:10.575 --> 02:19:12.077
THE LAW THEY WANT TO COMPLY WITH

02:19:12.143 --> 02:19:13.044
THE LAW.

02:19:13.111 --> 02:19:14.879
AND THERE ARE TIMES WHERE I GET

02:19:14.946 --> 02:19:16.214
PEOPLE THAT CALL ME WHO HAVE

02:19:16.281 --> 02:19:17.015
SOMETHING THAT THEY MAY HAVE

02:19:17.082 --> 02:19:18.550
LEARNED LEGALLY PURCHASE IN THE

02:19:18.616 --> 02:19:19.784
STATE AT ONE TIME.

02:19:19.851 --> 02:19:22.020
THAT'S NOW NO LONGER LEGAL AND

02:19:22.087 --> 02:19:23.021
THERE THEY MIGHT BE FACING

02:19:23.088 --> 02:19:25.223
CHARGES ARE THEY INADVERTENTLY

02:19:25.290 --> 02:19:26.791
VIOLATED SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY

02:19:26.858 --> 02:19:30.295
A NON VIOLENT ACT JUST BECAUSE

02:19:30.361 --> 02:19:31.996
OF THIS JUST.

02:19:32.063 --> 02:19:33.798
ONCE A LOT OF OF SO MANY LAWS ON

02:19:33.865 --> 02:19:35.934
ON HOW YOU CAN CARRY HOW TO

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:36.601
STORE --

02:19:36.668 --> 02:19:38.002
WHAT TO PURCHASE WHO YOU CAN

02:19:38.069 --> 02:19:39.871
LONG TO WHO YOU CAN'T ACCEPT OR

02:19:39.938 --> 02:19:41.106
ECCENTRIC CETERA?

02:19:41.172 --> 02:19:43.041
AND I THINK THAT THE PENALTIES

02:19:43.108 --> 02:19:44.442
REALLY SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THE

02:19:44.509 --> 02:19:46.578
CRIMINALS AND AND THESE ALSO

02:19:46.644 --> 02:19:47.445
JUST SO ONEROUS ON THE LAW

02:19:47.512 --> 02:19:48.146
ABIDING.

02:19:48.213 --> 02:19:50.048
AND MEANWHILE WE HAVE THIS ACT

02:19:50.115 --> 02:19:51.950
PROGRAM THAT HAS TEN THOUSAND

02:19:52.016 --> 02:19:53.585
PLUS KNOWN PROHIBITED PERSONS ON

02:19:53.651 --> 02:19:54.352
THERE.

02:19:54.419 --> 02:19:55.153
THAT WE'RE JUST NOT DOING A

02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:55.720
GREAT JOB OF CLEARING THE

02:19:55.787 --> 02:19:57.756
BACKLOG AND SO I DON'T THINK THE

02:19:57.822 --> 02:19:58.957
CALIFORNIA'S THE MODEL ON THAT I

02:19:59.023 --> 02:20:00.158
THINK WE NEED TO GET TOUGHER ON

02:20:00.225 --> 02:20:02.293
THOSE PROHIBITED PERSONS AND

02:20:02.360 --> 02:20:02.894
THOUGHT WHEN OPPOSITION THANK

02:20:02.961 --> 02:20:04.395
YOU.

02:20:04.462 --> 02:20:05.230
MISTER CHAIRMAN ROY GRIFFIS

02:20:05.296 --> 02:20:05.697
SPEAKING ON BEHALF THE

02:20:05.764 --> 02:20:06.865
CALIFORNIA RIFLE ANDPISTOL

02:20:06.931 --> 02:20:08.933
ASSOCIATION WERE ALSO IN STRONG

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:10.502
OPPOSITION TO THIS MARKET REPEAT

02:20:10.568 --> 02:20:12.504
MY COLLEAGUES ALREADY SAID BUT

02:20:12.570 --> 02:20:13.171
ONE THING THAT REALLY ANGERS ME

02:20:13.238 --> 02:20:15.006
MANY OF YOU KNOW MY BACKGROUND

02:20:15.073 --> 02:20:15.740
THIRTY TWO YEARS IN LAW

02:20:15.807 --> 02:20:16.875
ENFORCEMENT POOR I TOOK THIS

02:20:16.941 --> 02:20:18.009
POSITION.

02:20:18.076 --> 02:20:18.676
KILLING CRIMINALS UNDERSTAND IS

02:20:18.743 --> 02:20:20.278
TOUGH PENALTIE AND WHO WE ARE

02:20:20.345 --> 02:20:21.813
MAKING MORE LAWS AGAINST LAW

02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:23.348
ABIDING WHILE THE SAME.

02:20:23.414 --> 02:20:24.716
COMMITTEE HERE ROLLED OUT SENATE

02:20:24.783 --> 02:20:26.651
BILL SIX TWENTY A COUPLE YEARS

02:20:26.718 --> 02:20:28.620
AGO WHICH JUST ROLLS BACK THE

02:20:28.686 --> 02:20:31.556
FOLKS THAT CHOOSE IN THEIR MIND.

02:20:31.623 --> 02:20:33.758
TO USE A FARM THE COMMISSION OF

02:20:33.825 --> 02:20:36.227
A OF A CRIME AND WE'RE MAKE I'M

02:20:36.294 --> 02:20:37.228
WE HAD ONE MORE BREAKING THE LAW

02:20:37.295 --> 02:20:38.630
ABIDING WON'T WON'T FOR THOSE

02:20:38.696 --> 02:20:39.430
REASONS.

02:20:39.497 --> 02:20:41.099
WE OPPOSE THIS MEASURE CHAIRMAN

02:20:41.166 --> 02:20:42.600
THANK YOU.

02:20:42.667 --> 02:20:43.067
ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN

02:20:43.134 --> 02:20:47.338
OPPOSITION.

02:20:47.405 --> 02:20:48.840
MEMBERS ON DíAS.

02:20:48.907 --> 02:20:50.642
WORKS I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE

02:20:50.708 --> 02:20:51.676
BILL -- AND

02:20:51.743 --> 02:20:53.211
REGARDING THE COMMENTS ABOUT HOW

02:20:53.278 --> 02:20:54.879
DIFFICULT IT IS FOR LAW ABIDING

02:20:54.946 --> 02:20:56.681
GUN OWNERS.

02:20:56.748 --> 02:20:57.615
TO AND USE GUNS YOU KNOW MY

02:20:57.682 --> 02:20:58.983
DAD'S A HUNTER.

02:20:59.050 --> 02:21:00.552
HE GREW UP HUNTING I GREW UP IN

02:21:00.618 --> 02:21:03.087
HUNTING FAMILY HE'S NOT A LAWYER

02:21:03.154 --> 02:21:04.522
HE SOME AUS FIGURED OUT HOW TO

02:21:04.589 --> 02:21:06.457
OWN GUNS LEGALLY DOES JUST FINE

02:21:06.524 --> 02:21:08.026
SO I THINK MOST FOLKS.

02:21:08.092 --> 02:21:09.460
CAN FIGURE IT OUT I THINK THIS

02:21:09.527 --> 02:21:11.129
IS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE THAT WE

02:21:11.196 --> 02:21:12.697
HAVE TO SEND TO WASHINGTON DC --

02:21:12.764 --> 02:21:14.299
THAT WE NEED STRICTER GUN BOUNCE

02:21:14.365 --> 02:21:15.633
PREVENTION MEASURES TO PROTECT

02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:17.068
OUR CITIZENS --

02:21:17.135 --> 02:21:18.536
I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY TIMELY

02:21:18.603 --> 02:21:20.171
GIVEN THE FACT THAT HR EIGHT

02:21:20.238 --> 02:21:21.372
JUST PASSED --

02:21:21.439 --> 02:21:22.907
IN THE HOUSE WITHIN THE LAST

02:21:22.974 --> 02:21:24.008
COUPLE WEEKS I WAS THE FIRST

02:21:24.075 --> 02:21:24.709
TIME AND IT PASSED WITH

02:21:24.776 --> 02:21:27.545
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT BY THE WAY

02:21:27.612 --> 02:21:29.347
REPUBLICANS WERE ON THAT BILL.

02:21:29.414 --> 02:21:30.448
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE

02:21:30.515 --> 02:21:31.416
ACTUALLY TAKEN SOME PROACTIVE

02:21:31.482 --> 02:21:33.251
MEASURES AT FEDERALLY --

02:21:33.318 --> 02:21:35.253
YOU KNOW AFTER TWENTY TWENTY

02:21:35.320 --> 02:21:36.354
LITTLE KIDS FIVE YEAR OLDS WERE

02:21:36.421 --> 02:21:37.455
KILLED --

02:21:37.522 --> 02:21:38.890
DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND AND

02:21:38.957 --> 02:21:40.358
TWELVE WE DIDN'T ACT AS A

02:21:40.425 --> 02:21:42.260
COUNTRY AND HOW MANY MORE DUST

02:21:42.327 --> 02:21:43.294
WE NEED TO HAVE BEFORE WE

02:21:43.361 --> 02:21:45.563
ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION --

02:21:45.630 --> 02:21:46.297
SO I THINK --

02:21:46.364 --> 02:21:46.931
THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT I HOPE IT

02:21:46.998 --> 02:21:47.498
SENDS A MESSAGE TO THE U. S.

02:21:47.565 --> 02:21:50.635
SENATE HOPE WILL BE VOTING ON

02:21:50.702 --> 02:21:52.103
THE BACKGROUND CHECKS BILL SOON.

02:21:52.170 --> 02:21:53.805
THAT WE HAVE TO ACT AND WE HAVE

02:21:53.872 --> 02:21:55.273
TO ACT NOW TO PROTECT FOLKS IN

02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:56.507
OUR COMMUNITIES FROM GUNS AND TO

02:21:56.574 --> 02:21:58.843
KEEP THEM OUT OF THE WRONG HANDS

02:21:58.910 --> 02:21:59.944
SO I WILL PROBABLY SUPPORT THIS

02:22:00.011 --> 02:22:00.578
