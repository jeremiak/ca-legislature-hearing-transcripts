AND TO HAVE THIS TREMENDOUS CHANCE TO HELP LEAD AND GUIDE THE STATE ALONG WITH THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE ARE REALLY JUST A TREMENDOUS HONOR.

BAD ELECT YOU IN THAT I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING APPOINTED TO SERVE TO REALLY THAT THERE'S NO HIGHER HONOR IN MY MIND AND AS I SPOKE TO SOME OF YOU -- IT'S ALSO JUST A GREAT DEAL OF FUN TO BE ABLE TO SEE HOW THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF IMPLEMENTING CAN IMPACT AND CHANGE PEOPLE'S LIVES -- SO WITH THAT I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO TODAY'S CONVERSATION -- AND REALLY YEAR MANSI HERE'S A COM WHERE WE CAN COMPLETE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND REALLY MAKE MEANINGFUL AND COULD CHANGE -- FOR PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON OUR SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR MODDING WANT WE START IN YOUR DIRECTION. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND DOCTOR LET ME OFFER MY CONGRATULATIONS AS WELL ON THE GOVERNOR'S APPOINTMENT AND CONFIDENCE IN YOU. SHOULD IT OUR CHANCE TO TALK BRIEFLY THIS MORNING AND GET BETTER ACQUAINTED. PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN YEAR. PAST HISTORY NOT ONLY ADMINISTERING SOME LARGE ORGANIZATIONS BUT IS A PEDIATRICIAN. TUNE INTO THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN IN OUR STATE IN. SOME OVER MAYBE FUTURE PRIORITIZATION BUT LET ME START WITH THE QUESTION JUST ABOUT THIS SCALE THE SCOPE THE SIZE OF THIS AGENCY MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS OVER THIRTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. WHAT'S YOUR ADMINISTRATIVE VISION BEFORE WE GET TO YEAR MAYBE. PUBLIC HEALTH AND COMMUNITY HEALTH STATE HEALTH. HOW DO YOU MOVE INTO AN ORGANIZATION LIKE THAT IN DEVELOP? SYSTEMS THAT MIGHT. SOME MIGHT RESIST WHO WERE. ARE STUCK IN OLD HABITS AND OLD WAYS. SURE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- YOU ARE RIGHT THIS IS A TREMENDOUS IN LARGE ORGANIZATION WITH A VERY DIVERSE MISSION. EVERYTHING FROM HEALTH CARE DAY HUMAN SERVICES -- TO REALLY MANAGING A NORMA SITE T. PROJECTS SO THERE'S A LOT OF CULTURAL CORRALLING THAT IS NECESSARY -- HAVING HAD A CHANCE TO DO AT A DIFFERENT SCALE BUT STILL A LARGE SCALE IN LOS ANGELES. REALLY I THINK WHAT I'VE LEARNED IS LEADERSHIP MATTERS A GREAT DEAL -- AND BEING ABLE TO CLEARLY ARTICULATE A VISION. OF WHERE WE WANT TO GO AND REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE HISTORY OF HOW WE GOT TO THE CERTAIN MOMENT ARE THINGS THAT I PLAN TO DO WHEN HAVE EXPERIENCE DOING. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS -- USING EVERY OPPORTUNITY WHETHER IT'S YOUR DIRECTORS MEDIAN OR AN EMAIL TO ALL STAFF TO REALLY CONSISTENTLY BEAT THE DRUM OF A VISION OF COLLABORATION PARTNERSHIP USING OUR ASSETS BOTH PEOPLE DATA. PHYSICAL ASSETS DODD FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS TO REALLY MOVE IN A SPECIFIC DIRECTION TO LIFT UP ALL BOATS AND IT DOESN'T TO START WITH WHAT I SAY -- IT STARTS WITH WHAT AGENCY LEADERSHIP DOES AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT HEADS. AND IDENTIFYING LEADERS ABOUT SUPPORTING OUR EXISTING LEADERS AND IDENTIFYING NEW LEADERS IN VACANT POSITIONS WHERE WE CAN REALLY TRUST THE THERE ARE WELL ALIGNED. WITH THAT GOAL AND VISION AND CREATING AS MANY VENUES AS POSSIBLE THERE'S A LOT THAT'S GREAT THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING -- WITHIN THE AGENCY THAT CREATES CROSS DEPARTMENT COLLABORATION AND I WANT TO FIND AND IDENTIFY MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT WHETHER IT'S ON THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS OR I'LL BREAK PREVENTION OR THE YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES THAT REALLY FALL IN THE BELLY WORK OF THE HEALTH AND HUMAN. SERVICES AGENCY I SEE TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO DO MORE AND MORE OF THAT AS WE GO EIGHT IN IN YOU CITED SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE TALK SOME ABOUT -- HABSI OUTBREAKS THE THE FEVER -- UNFORTUNATELY ESTABLISHED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT NOW GROWING PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT IN THE SALINAS VALLEY -- YOU TOUCHED ON HOMELESSNESS. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU TALKED ABOUT IN OUR CONVERSATION WAS. HOW YOU COORDINATE WITH COUNTY? DEPARTMENTS IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY SO KINDA ZEROING IN ON THAT PUBLIC HEALTH MISSION. HOW DO YOU SEEN A YEAR LEADERSHIP -- HELPING US BETTER ANA ADDRESS SOME OF THESE PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS. SHE SURE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION OUR AS WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS MORNING SO MANY THINGS IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH ROUND DON'T KNOW A BOUNDARY. THEY DON'T FOLLOW THE COUNTY BORDER THEY DON'T FOLLOW THE CITY BORDER. THEY EXTEND AND SO THE STATE HAS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE -- IN WORKING WITH LOCAL COUNTY LEADERSHIP AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH ARENA TO ENSURE THAT THE ISSUES AT THE LOCAL LEVELARE MANAGED AS WELL AND COME PROPERLY AS POSSIBLE. THAT MEANS THAT BOTH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RESOURCE SUPPORT AND REALLY BEING A TOP PARTNER FOR EXAMPLE -- WHEN DO WE DECLARE A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY OR WHAT ARE THE STEPS THAT DEFINE THE DECLARATION OF A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY? AND THEN ENSURING THAT AS WE ACCOUNT FOR ONE HOW THINGS WE KNOW HOW DISEASES SPREAD AN OUTBREAK SPREAD BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH COUNTY IS WHO ARE KIND OF AT THE NEXT LINE OF CONCERN. SO THAT WERE AS PREPARED AS POSSIBLE SO I THINK IS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE THAT THE STATE CAN PLAY AN PARTNERING WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. TO MEET THAT LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH NEED BUT THEN THIS BROADER STATE NEED AS WELL. THANK YOU AND I KNOW OTHERS HAVE QUESTIONS TO OF THIS CLOSE WITH THE QUESTION IT GOES BACK TO CHILDREN IN PUBLIC HEALTH WE TALK SOME ABOUT -- CHALLENGES OF WHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS A PUBLIC HEALTH EPIDEMIC OF YOU SO BE CITY PREVENTABLE DIABETES -- HAD A WE IS A STATE GET IN FRONT OF THAT AS AS OPPOSED TO USING OUR LIMITED RESOURCES TO TREATING ILLNESS AND DISEASE. HAD A WE GET TO THE FRONT END OF PROMOTING HEALTH AND PREVENTION. SURE I THINK EIGHT EIGHT IF WE DEPEND ON THE PHYSICIANS AND CLINICIANS TO DO THAT WORK IT'S TOO LATE WE NEED TO HAVE THIS BE A COMMUNITY FOCUSED INITIATIVE. DIED IN EXERCISE WE NOW ARE TWO VERY KEY COMPONENTS -- WE HAVE TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE MIGHT NOT BE GREAT ACCESS TO EXERCISE SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAMS HEALTHY FOOD OPTIONS ALL THE THINGS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN DOING. BUT I THINK -- AS WE SORT OF ENTER THE NEW FRONTIER BE MORE AGGRESSIVE OVER -- SOME OF THE CONTRIBUTORS WHETHER THAT'S THE SORT OF SWEETENED BEVERAGE INDUSTRY OR WHETHER THAT THE PENAL ON HEALTHY FOODS THAT SO MANY COMMUNITIES HAVE EASIER ACCESS TO THAN HEALTHY FOODS. THERE'S A VERY MEANINGFUL ROLE WE HAVE TO PLAY AGAIN SUPPORTING LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO IMPLEMENT MONITORING AND SURVEILLANCE OF WHERE WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON THE DISH. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND AGAIN I JUST WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU IN THANK YOU FOR STEPPING UP. TO HELP LEADER STATE IN THESE VERY IMPORTANT ARENAS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SENATOR MINING IS SENATOR BATES THANK YOU OF AND LET ME ADD TO AYE ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE GOOD SENATOR ON TO MY LEFT. YOU HAVE AN AMAZING RESUME AND I WAS LOOKING AT THINKING AND YOU WANT TO DO THIS JOB SO. WE KNOW WITHOUT DOUBT CERTAINLY HAS -- PROBABLY A COMMITMENT TO THE PASSION THAT YOU HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE HAVE. A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR GOOD HEALTH AND JOB CERTAINLY A GOOD FUTURE BECAUSE OF THAT. I'VE BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN THE SILVER A LIVING HOME ISSUE IN THE OPIOID CRISIS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE IN MY DISTRICT WHICH IS SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY AND NORTH SAN DIEGO COUNTY. A LOT OF FUN YOUNG PEOPLE DYING HA FROM OUTSOLE I AM INTERESTED IN HEARING IF YOU HAVE SOME IDEAS ABOUT HOW WE CAN APPROACH. THE SOBER LIVING HOME ISSUE OF CERTAINLY THE FEDERAL ISSUES KIND OF OVERLAY BEING ABLE TO GET MORE OVERSIGHT NOT FULL MATCH THE REGULATORY. FIBER OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE MEETING THE PROMISES THAT THEY MAKE AND I YOU HAD -- LOT OF EXPERIENCE I BELIEVE READING YOUR RESUME IN LA. WITH THIS COULD YOU SHARE SOME IDEAS ON HOW WE HAVE FORMED A TASK FORCES A SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT TASK FORCE AND WE WILL LOOK FORWARD. TO PERHAPS YOU VISITING US FOR THE TIME TO SHARE SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON RESOURCES WE MIGHT REACH OUT TO THAT MAYBE A FEW MINUTES TO GIVE ME SOME IDEAS ON ALL OF THAT BECAUSE IT'S DRIVING IS YOU KNOW IN OUR COMMUNITIES HOMELESS. THE SUICIDE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE ALL OF THAT IS KINDA WRAPPED TOGETHER IN A MAJOR PROBLEM OUR COMMUNITIES ARE FACING. SO AGAIN FIRST THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND THE INVITATION I WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO JOINING YOU IN WHATEVER VENUE MAKES SENSE TO SHARE THOUGHTS AND AND REALLY DIALOGUE ABOUT THE ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S A COMPLICATED. ONE IT'S AN EMERGING -- ONE AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH THIS SORT OF GROWTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CHALLENGES IN COMMUNITIES WHETHER IT'S OPIATES ARE MAPPED OR OTHER. OTHER -- DRUGS ARE ADDICTIVE IN EASILY ABUSED -- AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS INTERESTING OPPORTUNITY OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO FOCUS ON IT WHETHER IT'S AROUND THE OPIATE SPECIFICALLY FOR DRUG MEDI CAL FOR EXAMPLE BROADLY SPEAKING. AND IT CREATES THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BRING NOT SO MUCH MORE REGULATION AS MUCH AS AN EXPECTATION AND A SET OF QUALITY MEASURES THAT HELPS DEFINE A GROWING INDUSTRY WHAT WE'VE MOVED AWAY. WHAT WE'RE MOVING AWAY FROM IS A SOLUTION YOU ORGANIZED A YOU KNOW HODGEPODGE TO THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE -- IN SOME WAYS A NETWORK THAT HS A CERTAIN STANDARD EXPECTATIONS THAT PEOPLE WHO LIVE NEAR THESE HOMES CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS WHO PEOPLE WHO SEND THEIR LOVE ONES -- TO WON THE SETTINGS CAN REALLY HAVE AN EXPECTATION AS TO WHAT THAT PERSON IS GOING TO RECEIVE WE'RE A WAYS AWAY FROM THAT CERTAINLY STATEWIDE THERE'S POCKETS OF THE STATE THAT ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT CHALLENGE LA IS ONE OF THEM SO I'M FAMILIAR WITH THAT. BUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT BROADLY SPREAD AND SOME OF THE ARTICLES I KNOW WE ALL TRACK CONSTITUENTS TO COME AND SHARE WITH YOU THE SAD STORIES OF LOVE ONES WHO WERE. PUT IN THESE PLACES EXPECTING TO HAVE GOOD OUTCOMES AND THEN WE OF TRAGEDY AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE ARE SOLUTIONS TO THAT THAT START WITH. HAVING SOME EXPECTATIONS QUALITY MEASURES AND THEN SOME OPPORTUNITY TO SAY LOOK IF YOU MEET THESE THE FUNDING WILL BE THERE TO SUPPORT YOU IN THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT. THANK YOU FOR THEIR RESPONSE YOU WILL SEE ME OR HEAR FROM ME I'LL FREQUENTLY. AS WE WRESTLE WITH THIS BECAUSE I KNOW IT TO ME AT THE COMMON DENOMINATOR OF A LOT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH FIVE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE FACING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. TRULY A FULL THANK YOU DOCTOR AND YOU WILL HAVE MY SUPPORT THANK YOU I LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE CONVERSATIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES. MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU PRO TEM. WHERE TO START? SO I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT PAGE EIGHTEEN OF THE LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES AUDIT. ALL I MEMORIZED PAGE SEVENTEEN YEAH I KNOW I DIDN'T GET TO EIGHTEEN I'M SORRY REALLY I'M ONLY KIDDING ANYWAY SO WE SO WE SO WE DISCUSS THE ISSUE AND I AND A YOU WANT YEAH I KNOW YOU WALKED OFF WITH A COPY SO. BASICALLY I HAD TO CONSTITUENTS OF ONE THAT WAS MURDERED BECAUSE NOW IT'S THE CORSETED DEMAND OTHER ONES ALLEGEDLY MURDERED A TEN YEAR OLD BOY AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY. SHOULD AND PULLED OUT A HOPE OF HOME ALONE A LONG TIME AGO THEIR THEIR THEIR TRAGIC STORIES -- MEETING WITH THE AUDITOR RECENTLY AFTER THE REPORT CAME OUT. THE ONE QUICK THERE'S NOTHING WE DO LEGISLATIVELY SO WAS ALL KIND OF LIKE SYSTEMATIC. ANSWER THE QUESTION I HAD FOR HER WAS IS LA COUNTY AND OUT LIAR THAT THEY'RE JUST SO LARGE AND UNWIELDY OR DO YOU THINK THIS A PROBLEM EVERYWHERE AND HER ANSWER IS SHE DID KNOW SO. JUST. IT'S ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS IN LA COUNTY WAIT WHETHER YOU THINK IT'S A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM ACROSS THE STATE AND AND WHAT. DO YOU PLAN TO DO ABOUT IT IF IN FACT IT IS A PROBLEM STATEWIDE. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- SO. I KNOW YOU TO VOTE BY RESUMES IN BACKGROUND BUT I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING AS A PEDIATRICIAN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM -- INFORMALLY IN SAN FRANCISCO IS A COMMUNITY PEDIATRICIAN TAKING CARE PLENTY OF THE KIDS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM BUT MORE FORMALLY IN LOS ANGELES -- AS PART OF A CLINIC SYSTEM THAT TAKES CARE OF SPECIFICALLY KIDS IN. FOSTER CARE. AND I THINK UNFORTUNATELY IT IS -- IT'S LIKELY A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM. HI I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT. THE WORK OF CHILD WELFARE DEPARTMENTS THE SOCIAL WORKERS -- IT IS HARD WORK IT IS -- THERE ARE THERE CHALLENGING STORIES SOMETIMES THE STAFF DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE SUPPORT AND UP TO DATE TRAINING THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PICK. PICK UP EVERY ISSUE THAT A CHILD MIGHT BE FACING I THINK THEY OFTEN WORKING CONDITIONS WHERE KIDS ARE MOVED AROUND WE TALK IN THE DOCTOR IN THE MEDICINE WORLD ABOUT CONTINUITY -- WE DON'T. SORT OF VALUE OR EMPHASIZED CONTINUITY IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM NEARLY ENOUGH. SINGLE KID WILL MAYBE HAVE THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT SOCIAL WORKERS IN THE COURSE OF THE YEAR AND THAT IN ITSELF ALLOWS YOU TO DROP THE BALL SO THERE ARE IN THE SYSTEM MANY OPPORTUNITIES. TO DROPPING ISSUE AND IT'S REAL PROBLEM AND I THINK IT COMES AROUND OUR SYSTEMSTHAT. AND THESE THESE ARE PROGRAMS ARE BASED ON WHETHER THOSE OF THE I. T. SYSTEMS OR THE TRAINING PROGRAMS AND THEN IT ALSO COMES DOWN TO SUPERVISION -- I KNOW THAT THE REPORT YOU SHARED WITH ME AND IT'S NOT A SURPRISE TO ME THAT EVEN WHEN THE CASE CARRYING THE CASELOADS OF THE INDIVIDUAL -- SOCIAL WORKERS ARE ADEQUATE SOMETIMES THEY DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT BECAUSE SUPERVISORS ARE SPREAD TOO THING SO I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS AND WE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND OUR CHILD WELFARE BRANCH. CAN DO TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMPANIES TO ENSURE THAT SOME OF THE VERY CLEAR AREAS OF CONCERN ARE SHORED UP SO THAT WE CAN AT LEAST SAID EVERYBODY UP FOR THE OPTIMAL SUCCESS AND I THINK THE AUDIT. REFLECTS THAT AND MY SUSPICION IS THAT THESE ARE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WOULD SERVE THE ENTIRE STATE FAIRLY WELL. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR -- FOLLOW QUESTION -- I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN ON THE FRONTLINE IN TERMSOF THE THE DATA ON FIVE FOSTER YOUTH. ONLY ONLY 4% -- GO ON TO GRADUATE AND GET A GET A BA AND TOO MANY ARE HOMELESS AND TOO MANY OR ARE INCARCERATED. AND AND COURSE IN IN MY CASE I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS BEING FROM LA COUNTY ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE FOSTER YOUTH IS IN I IN MY DISTRICT. SO JUST CURIOUS YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS IN THE PROGRAM AND MAYBE A VISION MOVING FORWARD THAT CAN HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT. ON ON THIS COMMUNITY THAT THE NEEDS ALL THE HELP THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THEM. YOU KNOW THERE ARE THERE ARE SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES I THINK COULD OFTEN BECAUSE CHILD WELFARE DEPART. DEPARTMENTS HAVE REALLY TWO RELATED BUT DISTINCT MISSIONS CHILD PROTECTION AND THEN ENSURING KIDS IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM THRIVE -- AND AS WE THINK ABOUT THE SECOND GROUP RIGHT KIDS WHO ARE. IN FOSTER CARE OUT OF HOME PLACEMENT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT A MORE NORMALIZED CHILDHOOD -- THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THE KIDS GET A CHANCE TO BE IN CHOIR CODED DANCER BEYOND THAT SPORTS TEAM WE SOMETIMES OVERLOOK THAT CHANCE TO MAKE THAT CONNECTION. BECAUSE WERE SO OVERWHELMED WITH TEST SOME OF THE OTHER BREAD AN BUTTER ISSUES I WOULD LOVE TO SEE US MOVE TOWARDS. THAT -- SUCCESS NOT JUST HEY DID WE GET THEM SAFELY TO EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY FOUR BUTWHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE FOR THEM IN WHERE WHERE THE OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THE STORY. OF THE CHILD IN IN THE SYSTEM WHO MEETS THAT CULTURE THAT CHOIR INSTRUCTOR WHO REALLY PULLS A MOP AND SUPPORTS THEM. AND SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO FULFILL THAT VISION I THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE HOLISTICALLY THEM WE HAVE IS A SYSTEM AND I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. THE DEPARTMENT TO EXPLORE WAYS TO DO THAT. LIKE A LIKE A FOSTER YOUTH GRANT FOR EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES YOU THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. I'VE HEARD SOMEONE -- PICKS THAT IDEA AND I I THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT. ONE ALL RIGHT. I PROMISE I'LL TAKE IT AS AN ENDORSEMENT. ON THE WAY REALLY REALLY ENJOYED OUR TIME TOGETHER AND YOU'VE GOT A BIG CHALLENGE BUT I KNOW I KNOW THAT YOU'RE UP TO THE TASK AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD -- TO VOTING TO CONFIRM THE TODAY THANK YOU DOCTOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER ROTH THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM. MISTER SECRETARY CONGRATULATIONS EXTRAORDINARILY WELL QUALIFIED AND FRANKLY WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

TO YOU KNOW DO ONE ON ONE WITH YOU -- I NEED TO CLARIFY THAT IT HAS TO DO WITH WHETHER YOUR INTERPRETATION OF THE REGULATION REALLY GOES TO WHAT MISS ROTH KEY SAID ABOUT. REFLECTING WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT TWICE SO I INTEND TO DO JUST A LITTLE CLOSER LOOK AT THAT. ON BECAUSE THAT WAS SOMETHING BROUGHT UP ACTUALLY ON IS REALLY TWO YEARS AGO HI AND STILL KIND OF FLOATS OUT THERE WHEN. I WASN'T REALLY YOU KNOW. INVOLVED IN ALL THEY ALSO KNOW THAT I HAVE HIGH REGARD FOR WHAT YOU DO AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO YOUR JOB AND JOB. WHEN WE GET TO THE FLOOR I'LL HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AT THAT TIME?

TREMENDOUS LEVEL OF SERVICE TO OUR STATE. AND I DO HAVE JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL HELP. EDUCATE ALL OF THIS IN. TO THOSE% IN THE PUBLIC THAT MAY BE LISTING. AND I'D START WITH MS BROWN SKIN. ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT MACHINE I HAVE A HISTORY THAT GOES BACK TO OUR LAW SCHOOL DAYS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO WERE MISTER GLACIS NOW SERVES AS A PROFESSOR -- SO IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AND TO SEE THE AMAZING CAREER THAT THAT YOU'VE BUILT. ON BUT I THINK LURKING AROUND SOME OF CONCERNS PUBLIC PERCEPTION WHATEVER. HELP ME UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SEE HOW YOU FIND BALANCE BETWEEN EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE INTERESTS LAWS DESIGNED TO PROTECT EMPLOYEE RIGHTS BUT FOR THEM TO BE EFFECTIVE. YOU NEED TO IN INCLUDING JOHN EMPLOYER INTERESTS LANDLORD TENANT. HOW DO YOU IN YOUR WORK OW DO YOU -- INCORPORATE THOSE INTERESTS. TO A SURE THAT REGULATIONS ARE CLEAR SHE SAID IN CAN BE FOLLOWED AND PROVIDE DIRECTION TO BOTH EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. WELL I THINK -- ANNA SPEAKING FOR MYSELF BUT I THINK I SPEAK FOR EVERYONE ELSE ON THE COUNCIL TO IS IT WE PLACED SO CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE PUBLIC COMMENTS THAT COME IN. AND WHAT FROM WHICHEVER SIDE I MEAN AND THERE ARE SIDES EVERYONE -- EVERYONE IS I CONSIDER EVERYONE I LOOK AT IT I PUT MYSELF IN THEIR SHOES I LOOK AT WHETHER IT CAN BE. WHETHER WHETHER WHAT WE'RE DOING IS ENFORCEABLE IS IT COMPREHENSIBLE AS I SAID BEFORE IS THAT WORKABLE. AND EIGHT YOU KNOW IT IT AS A LAWYER WERE TRAINED TO LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE ALL THE TIME BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THE WEAKNESSES OF YOUR CASE IS. OUR JUSTICE AND YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE STRENGTHS ARE. AND SO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL SIDES AND FIGURE OUT WHETHER THAT WORKS AND VERY RARELY DOES A FIRST DRAFT I MEAN NEVER HAS A FIRST DRAFT ENDED UP AS A FIRST DRAFT IN THE WE GO THROUGH SO MANY VERSIONS OF THESE REGULATIONS AND IT'S BECAUSE WE KEEP. GETTING REPEATEDLY -- PUBLIC COMMENTS. FINALLY THE PUBLIC COMMENTS WILL SAY OKAY YES WE CAN LIVE WITH THAT OR YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THEY CAN'T AND WE MAKE WE DO MAKE A DECISION AT THE END. BUT WE ALWAYS TRY TO STAY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE DO BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED. AND WE HAVE A YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN AMAZING SET OF CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS IN THIS IN THE STATE AND I THINK THE LEGISLATURE HAS DECLARED. A IT'S PUBLIC POLICY AND WE ALWAYS TRY TO TRY TO ALWAYS SIT HERE TO THAT. THANK YOU IN. MAYBE WHILE YOU HAVE THE MIKE JUST A FOLLOW UP FOR FRIEDMAN SPREAD SKI IS -- AN ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY HOURS A MONTH YOU MIGHT DEVOTE TO THIS WORK IT'S LARGELY VOLUNTARY AND IF YOU HAD A MAGIC WAND WHAT. WHAT? COULD WE DO. TO OFFER MORE SUPPORT IN THE SUCCESS OF YOUR MISSION. WELL IT IT IT ABSENT FLOWS -- WHEN I WHEN I WAS WHEN -- SURE AND I WERE WORKING ON THE ONE ONE ONE THREE FIVE A FIRST DRAFT OF THOSE REGULATIONS WHICH WILL BE GOING AWAY ALL I WOULD SAY I SPENT. I MEAN I DON'T EVEN CAN'T EVEN ESTIMATE MAYBE. THIRTY HOURS A WEEK TWENTY HOURS A WEEK I MEAN A HUGE AMOUNT OF HOURS IN ADDITION. TO MY DAY JOB. AND THEN YOU KNOW PARENTING AND THINGS OF THAT SORT -- SO IT IT VERY SOME RIGHT NOW WE'RE WAITING WE'RE WAITING FOR A WHALE -- TO HEAR BACK FROM THEM ON THE REGULATIONS SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF YOU KNOW THERE IS DOWN TIME. SO IT'S NOT CONSTANT BUT WHEN YOU ARE WORKING ON THESE THINGS WE SPEND. WE SPEND ALL I MEAN WE DO ALL THE RESEARCH THE READNG OF THE EVERY COMMENT ALL OF THAT SO IT IT TAKES AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TIME. THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES AN AMAZING STAFF -- THEY HAVE THEY ARE THEY ARE AMAZING. BUT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH. AND IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IF THERE WAS A LITTLE MORE. THAT'S BUT DATE THEY DO WHAT THEY CAN AND I'M I'M SO GRATEFUL TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT -- IN INDIA PH AND WHAT IT DOES FOR US. BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE. A LITTLE MORE HELP TO AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE -- AND ALE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW YES. I SHIPS -- TRANSCRIPT A REVIEW THE THE REGULATIONS BEFORE THEY THEN. THANK YOU AND MAKE SURE IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING TO THAT MAYBE BACK TO KIND OF THE CORE QUESTION OF HOW YOU. HOW YOU? LISTEN TO TAKEINTO ACCOUNT THE CONCERNS OF EMPLOYERS LANDLORDS AT CITRUS SO THAT WHAT YOU DO PRODUCE IS. SOMETHING THAT IS CLEAR AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE. I WANT TO ECHO EVERYTHING MISS BRODSKY SAID -- AS A LITIGATOR FOR MANY YEARS THANK YOU FOR FRUSTRATED WHEN I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT A REGULATION SAYS SO ONE OF MY GOALS IS TO TRY AND MAKE SURE. IT'S VERY HARD TARGET TO HIT THAT IT'S AS CLEAR AND AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE AND I THINK I SPEAK FOR ALL OF US WE SAY THAT IS PART OF THE GOAL THAT WE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION. TO WE LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY WE MAKE CHANGES BASED ON COMMENTS FROM. EVERY STAKEHOLDER AND I MUST SAY IN MANY CASES IT IS NOT TWO SIDES IT IS THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON AN ISSUE AND ULTIMATELY THERE IS A BALANCING TEST BUT WE LEARNED A LOT FROM ALL OF THEM AND INITIAL QUESTION THE FIRST STAFF WE GO A WHOLE. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT -- I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT ISSUE SO THAT'S VERY COMMON. I WOULD SAY. I BRING NOT ONLY MAKES FRANCIS LITIGATOR BUT I'M ALSO A LANDLORD AND I WORKED ON THE MANAGEMENT SIDE AS A MANAGER IN MY AGENCY FOR MANY YEARS SO. I'VE ALSO HAD SOME ABILITY TO SEE MOST OF THESE THINGS FROM BOTH SIDES. RELEASE OR TALK ABOUT HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT REGULATIONS -- ULTIMATELY IT IS TRYING TO DO WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE DIRECTED IN TERMS OF A STRONG COMMITMENT TO CIVIL RIGHTS THAT IS.
