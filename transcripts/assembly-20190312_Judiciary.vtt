00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:40.090
TO DEMAND THAT OTHERS USE THEIR

00:42:40.157 --> 00:42:42.159
PRONOUN A PREFERENCE.

00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:44.695
THE FIRST ISSUE IS OF MORALITY.

00:42:44.762 --> 00:42:46.764
IT IS WRONG TO TEACH FOSTER KIDS

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:48.933
THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO FORCE

00:42:48.999 --> 00:42:51.969
OTHER PERSONS TO SAY WORDS THAT

00:42:52.036 --> 00:42:53.504
THAT PERSON DOESN'T BELIEVE.

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:54.905
IN ANY OTHER CONTEXT THIS WOULD

00:42:54.972 --> 00:42:56.941
BE UNTHINKABLE.

00:42:57.007 --> 00:42:59.310
WHEN A CHILD OR EVEN ADULT TRIES

00:42:59.376 --> 00:43:00.611
TO MAKE ANOTHER PERSON SAY

00:43:00.678 --> 00:43:02.646
SOMETHING THAT CONTRADICTS THAT

00:43:02.713 --> 00:43:04.748
PERSON'S BELIEF SYSTEM?

00:43:04.815 --> 00:43:06.116
IT'S RUDE AND OBNOXIOUS.

00:43:06.183 --> 00:43:07.384
BUT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT GETS

00:43:07.451 --> 00:43:09.420
INVOLVED AND TRIES TO MANDATE

00:43:09.486 --> 00:43:11.121
THE WORDS THAT COME OUT OF A

00:43:11.188 --> 00:43:12.122
PERSON'S MOUTH.

00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:14.058
IT'S TO RAN A COAL.

00:43:14.124 --> 00:43:15.726
THE FIRST AMENDMENT DOES NOT NOT

00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:17.328
ONLY PROTECTS OUR FREEDOM TO

00:43:17.394 --> 00:43:19.129
SPEAK WORDS THE GOVERNMENT

00:43:19.196 --> 00:43:20.297
DOESN'T LIKE.

00:43:20.364 --> 00:43:21.532
BUT THE PROHIBITS THE GOVERNMENT

00:43:21.598 --> 00:43:23.701
FROM COMPELLING US TO SAY WORDS

00:43:23.767 --> 00:43:25.803
OR PROMOTE IDEAS WE DON'T

00:43:25.869 --> 00:43:26.804
BELIEVE.

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:28.372
THIS COMMITTEE LEARNED THAT THE

00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:30.841
HARD WAY LAST YEAR WHEN THE US

00:43:30.908 --> 00:43:32.676
SUPREME COURT INVALIDATED ONE OF

00:43:32.743 --> 00:43:35.212
ITS LAWS THIS COMMITTEE APPROVED

00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:37.147
SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

00:43:37.214 --> 00:43:38.882
HERE IS WHAT JUSTICE ANTHONY

00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:40.751
KENNEDY SAID WHEN HE AND FOUR

00:43:40.818 --> 00:43:42.786
OTHER JUSTICES STRUCK DOWN THE

00:43:42.853 --> 00:43:44.989
REPRODUCTIVE FACT ACT.

00:43:45.055 --> 00:43:46.857
AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

00:43:46.924 --> 00:43:48.158
AND I QUOTE.

00:43:48.225 --> 00:43:49.693
GOVERNMENTS MUST NOT BE ALLOWED

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:52.329
TO FORCE PERSONS TO EXPRESS THE

00:43:52.396 --> 00:43:54.898
MESSAGE CONTRARY TO THEIR

00:43:54.965 --> 00:43:56.100
DEEPEST CONVICTIONS.

00:43:56.166 --> 00:43:58.235
FREEDOM OF SPEECH SECURES

00:43:58.302 --> 00:43:59.770
FREEDOM OF THOUGHT AND BELIEF.

00:43:59.837 --> 00:44:02.773
THIS LAW IN PERIL OF THOSE

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.274
LIBERTIES CLOSE QUOTE.

00:44:04.341 --> 00:44:06.844
NO ONE WANTS TO BE FORCED TO SAY

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:08.445
WHAT THEY DO NOT BELIEVE.

00:44:08.512 --> 00:44:10.981
WHEN YOU FORCE TRANSGENDER PRO

00:44:11.048 --> 00:44:13.250
SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES THAT GENDER

00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:14.685
IS BINARY?

00:44:14.752 --> 00:44:16.854
AND DETERMINED BY BIOLOGY YOU

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.255
ARE COMPELLING SPEECH.

00:44:18.322 --> 00:44:19.423
IT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE THE

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:21.191
CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH

00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:23.193
FOSTER FAMILIES FOR THOSE

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:24.928
CHILDREN NEEDING THEM.

00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:25.929
DURING THE LAST HEARING

THROUGH THAT --

00:54:30.533 --> 00:54:32.569
BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S BEEN

00:54:32.636 --> 00:54:35.071
POINTED OUT SOME OF THESE THINGS --

00:54:35.138 --> 00:54:35.972

HERE'S DEFINITELY THINGS THAT

00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:17.747
COULD BE A REASONABLE USE OF A

00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:19.549
PARENT UTILIZING THEIR AUTHORITY

00:55:19.616 --> 00:55:21.418

SOMETHING DIFFERENT? FOR FOSTER

00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:38.735
PARENTS AND WE WOULD EXPECT --

00:55:38.802 --> 00:55:40.804
THEN WE WOULD EXPECT OF

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:42.505
OURSELVES AS PARENTS.

00:55:42.572 --> 00:55:44.140
PARENTING OUR OWN CHILDREN --

00:55:44.207 --> 00:55:45.141
SO I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY

00:55:45.208 --> 00:55:47.043
THINK ABOUT THAT BEFORE WE JUST

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:48.545
ESTABLISHED THIS IS SOME SORT OF

00:55:48.611 --> 00:55:49.846
RIGHT -- AND

00:55:49.913 --> 00:55:51.981
I THINK WITH WITH WITH REGARD TO

00:55:52.048 --> 00:55:52.849
THE GENDER IDENTITY ISSUE I KNOW

00:55:52.916 --> 00:55:54.484
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING IS

00:55:54.551 --> 00:55:57.087
VERY SENSITIVE. TO A LOT OF

00:55:57.153 --> 00:55:58.855
PEOPLE --

00:55:58.922 --> 00:56:00.457
BUT THERE ARE CASES WHERE YOU

00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:02.325
KNOW WHERE THERE'S GENDER

00:56:02.392 --> 00:56:05.862
DYSPHORIA AND AND THAT ACTUALLY --

00:56:05.929 --> 00:56:09.099
THE CHILD ENDS UP GOING BY THEIR

00:56:09.165 --> 00:56:10.734
BIOLOGICAL SEX BY THE TIME THEY

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.435
REACH ADULTHOOD --

00:56:12.502 --> 00:56:14.370
AND SO.

00:56:14.437 --> 00:56:15.672
AND THERE MAY BE ISSUES WE KNOW

00:56:15.739 --> 00:56:17.240
THAT FOSTER USE DEAL WITH A LOT

00:56:17.307 --> 00:56:19.109
OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES

00:56:19.175 --> 00:56:21.511
AS WE KNOW ACES --

00:56:21.578 --> 00:56:23.146
THERE COULD BE A YOU KNOW OTHER

00:56:23.213 --> 00:56:24.681
THINGS GOING ON THAT IS PART OF

00:56:24.748 --> 00:56:26.449
A COUNSELING --

00:56:26.516 --> 00:56:28.585
REGIMEN AS PART OF SUPPORTING

00:56:28.651 --> 00:56:29.953
THAT USE IN GETTING THROUGH THIS

00:56:30.019 --> 00:56:31.654
THEY MAY HANDLE THAT DIFFERENTLY

00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:32.222
THAN.

00:56:32.288 --> 00:56:35.125
SAY THE PEOPLE ON THIS COMMITTEE.

00:56:35.191 --> 00:56:36.593
THANK YOU SHOULD HANDLE THAT.

00:56:36.659 --> 00:56:38.394
AND YOU KNOW I DON'T REALLY

00:56:38.461 --> 00:56:39.496
THINK THAT THAT'S OUR PLACE TO

00:56:39.562 --> 00:56:40.797
DETERMINE.

00:56:40.864 --> 00:56:43.566
YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT NAMES YOU

00:56:43.633 --> 00:56:45.168
SHOULD USE.

00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:46.302
YOU HOW YOU SHOULD DEAL WITH

00:56:46.369 --> 00:56:48.004
THAT SITUATION AND A AND IT I

00:56:48.071 --> 00:56:50.140
THINK IT IS VERY SPECIFIC TO THE

00:56:50.206 --> 00:56:51.741
CHILD THAT'S INVOLVES NOT EVERY

00:56:51.808 --> 00:56:53.710
CHILD IS THE SAME WE ALL KNOW

00:56:53.777 --> 00:56:56.179
THAT WE ALL SAY THAT --

00:56:56.246 --> 00:56:58.581
BUT WE SEEM TO HAVE A PROBLEM.

00:56:58.648 --> 00:57:00.183
DOING THAT IN PRACTICE WHEN

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:01.951
WE'RE WHEN WE'RE PASSING LAW --

00:57:02.018 --> 00:57:03.820
SO YOU KNOW I JUST THINK THAT AT

00:57:03.887 --> 00:57:05.889
THIS TIME APPOINTED TIME WITH

00:57:05.955 --> 00:57:06.923
WHERE THIS BILLS THAT IT'S

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:08.124
PREMATURE AND I THINK THERE'S A

00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:09.392
LOT OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE

00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:12.095
WORKED THROUGH --

00:57:12.162 --> 00:57:14.464
THAT COULD ACTUALLY IMPEDE.

00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:16.533
THE ABILITY OF OF FOSTER PARENTS

00:57:16.599 --> 00:57:18.201
TO PROVIDE THAT.

00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:20.570
THAT SAVE SPACE THAT STRUCTURED

00:57:20.637 --> 00:57:21.738
SPACE THAT PLACE IS GOING TO

00:57:21.805 --> 00:57:24.641
BRING THIS CHILD TO ADULTHOOD.

00:57:24.707 --> 00:57:26.276
AND INTO A PRODUCTIVE LIFESTYLE

00:57:26.342 --> 00:57:27.610
LONG TERM --

00:57:27.677 --> 00:57:28.812
AND SO I KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO

00:57:28.878 --> 00:57:30.380
DO THAT.

00:57:30.446 --> 00:57:31.714
AND THAT'S WHY I WOULD JUST SAY

00:57:31.781 --> 00:57:33.049
HEY I THINK THIS ME SOME MORE

00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:35.285
TIME NEED SOME MORE DISCUSSION.

00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:35.985
AND I YOU KNOW CAN'T BE

00:57:36.052 --> 00:57:37.554
SUPPORTER OF IT IN ITS CURRENT

00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:40.990
FORM.

00:57:41.057 --> 00:57:42.125
HI THANK YOU MISTER GIBSON FOR

00:57:42.192 --> 00:57:42.725
BRINGING THIS FORWARD I WOULD

00:57:42.792 --> 00:57:44.327
POINT OUT TO THE COMMITTEE THAT

00:57:44.394 --> 00:57:45.695
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS

00:57:45.762 --> 00:57:47.230
EVERYONE OF THE RIGHTS THAT'S

00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:48.031
LISTED.

00:57:48.097 --> 00:57:49.666
HAS A STATUTORY OR REGULATORY

00:57:49.732 --> 00:57:50.900
REFERENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:53.036
THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS BILL

00:57:53.102 --> 00:57:55.905
THAT ESTABLISHES ANY NEW RIGHTS.

00:57:55.972 --> 00:57:58.675
OR OBLIGATIONS THEY ARE ENTIRELY

00:57:58.741 --> 00:58:02.078
EXISTING IN CALIFORNIA LAW THE

00:58:02.145 --> 00:58:05.014
VALUE OF THIS STATEMENT.

00:58:05.081 --> 00:58:07.684
AND WHY A THERE'S NOT A QUESTION

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:08.818
OF CONSTITUTIONALITY WHERE

00:58:08.885 --> 00:58:09.919
THERE'S NOT A QUESTION THAT WERE

00:58:09.986 --> 00:58:11.855
IMPOSING ANYTHING.

00:58:11.921 --> 00:58:12.555
IS THAT IT IS A VERY.

00:58:12.622 --> 00:58:16.359
CLEAR SO FOR FOSTER KIDS TO BE

00:58:16.426 --> 00:58:18.995
ABLE TO SEE WHERE THEIR RIGHTS

00:58:19.062 --> 00:58:20.797
ARE ENUMERATED BECAUSE THEY

00:58:20.864 --> 00:58:22.532
ALREADY EXIST IN STATUTE EXISTED

00:58:22.599 --> 00:58:23.666
REGULATION.

00:58:23.733 --> 00:58:26.336
THERE'S NOTHING NEW IN HERE SO I

00:58:26.402 --> 00:58:28.438
DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY THEY

00:58:28.504 --> 00:58:29.072
SHOULD MOVE FORWARD I DON'T SEE

00:58:29.138 --> 00:58:31.040
WHY.

00:58:31.107 --> 00:58:33.509
WE NEED TO WAIT FOR ANYTHING IN

00:58:33.576 --> 00:58:34.577
ADDITION I THINK YOU'VE DONE A

00:58:34.644 --> 00:58:35.345
VERY GOOD JOB WITH THIS MISTER

00:58:35.411 --> 00:58:39.749
GIBSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND

00:58:39.816 --> 00:58:40.917
ALL RIGHT MISTER GALLAGHER.

00:58:40.984 --> 00:58:42.852
I MEAN IF IF I MIGHT --

00:58:42.919 --> 00:58:43.987
YOU KNOW WE HAVE SOME GREAT

00:58:44.053 --> 00:58:46.122
PEOPLE UP HERE WHO DO ANALYSES

00:58:46.189 --> 00:58:47.790
AND AND AND MY GIVE THEM A LOT

00:58:47.857 --> 00:58:49.158
OF CREDIT FOR WHAT THEY PUT

00:58:49.225 --> 00:58:50.827
TOGETHER BUT AN ANALYSIS OF THE

00:58:50.894 --> 00:58:52.128
COMMITTEE IS NOT LIKE THE END

00:58:52.195 --> 00:58:53.162
ALL BE ALL.

00:58:53.229 --> 00:58:55.765
AND HEY THAT'S THE FINAL ANSWER --

00:58:55.832 --> 00:58:57.333
NO AND AND I GUESS THE OTHER

00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:59.369
PART WOULD BE.

00:58:59.435 --> 00:58:59.636
YOU KNOW.

00:58:59.702 --> 00:59:01.271
YOU KNOW IF THIS IS TRUE THAT IS

00:59:01.337 --> 00:59:04.607
ALL STATUTORY REGULATORY THAN

00:59:04.674 --> 00:59:05.208
THAT WOULD NEGATE THE NEED FOR

00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:06.342
THE BILL.

00:59:06.409 --> 00:59:07.310
BECAUSE OF ITS ALREADY IF IT'S

00:59:07.377 --> 00:59:08.378
ALREADY ESTABLISHED LAW WHY ARE

00:59:08.444 --> 00:59:10.113
WE DOING ANOTHER LAW. TO JUST

00:59:10.179 --> 00:59:11.714
REPEAT THAT I SUSPECT THAT

00:59:11.781 --> 00:59:13.283
THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT THE CASE AND

00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:14.784
THAT'S WHY I'M MANY OF THE

00:59:14.851 --> 00:59:15.952
CONCERNS BEEN REYES AGAIN IF YOU

00:59:16.019 --> 00:59:17.320
LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS AND I'M NOT

00:59:17.387 --> 00:59:19.188
SAYING THE ANALYSIS IS IS WHAT

00:59:19.255 --> 00:59:20.223
ESTABLISHES THAT.

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:21.491
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT EACH OF THE

00:59:21.557 --> 00:59:22.659
PROVISIONS.

00:59:22.725 --> 00:59:27.597
THAT ARE LAID OUT IN IT IS KEYED

00:59:27.664 --> 00:59:28.965
TO EXISTING STATUTES OR SIZE YOU

00:59:29.032 --> 00:59:29.499
WOULD NEED TO GO READ THE

00:59:29.565 --> 00:59:31.334
STATUTES AND EACH REGULATORY

00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:33.303
REFERENCE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE

00:59:33.369 --> 00:59:35.138
ALL OF THE PROVISIONS ARE.

00:59:35.204 --> 00:59:36.906
AND GIVEN THAT THERE IS A LACK

00:59:36.973 --> 00:59:38.608
OF UNDERSTANDING EVEN HERE OF

00:59:38.675 --> 00:59:40.009
THE CONNECTIVITY TO THE

00:59:40.076 --> 00:59:41.244
STATUTORY FRAMEWORK INTO THE

00:59:41.311 --> 00:59:43.246
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THINK HOW.

00:59:43.313 --> 00:59:45.415
DIFFICULT THAT IS FOR A FOSTER

00:59:45.481 --> 00:59:46.749
CHILD TO NAVIGATE.

00:59:46.816 --> 00:59:49.218
THE VALUE OF THIS BILL THE VALUE

00:59:49.285 --> 00:59:51.054
OF THIS STATEMENT OF FOSTER

00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:52.488
CHILD'S BILL OF RIGHTS IS SO

00:59:52.555 --> 00:59:55.325
THAT IS CLEARLY PUT IN ONE PLACE.

00:59:55.391 --> 00:59:57.694
FOR REFERENCE THIS IS A DOCUMENT

00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:58.995
THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED.

00:59:59.062 --> 00:59:59.729
TO FOSTER CHILDREN WHO ARE IN

00:59:59.796 --> 01:00:01.698
THE CARE OF THE STATE.

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:04.567
SO THAT THEY AT LEAST HAVE A

01:00:04.634 --> 01:00:06.469
CLEAR STATEMENT THAT OF WHAT

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:08.104
THEIR RIGHTS ARE THEY CAN PURSUE

01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:08.972
THAT.

01:00:09.038 --> 01:00:10.873
IF OTHERWISE NECESSARY BUT

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:12.642
THERE'S NOTHING REALLY IN HERE

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:15.244
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS ALREADY WELL

01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:16.646
ESTABLISHED MR.

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:17.814
TO THANK YOU.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.549
I WASN'T GOING TO SPEAK ON THIS

01:00:19.615 --> 01:00:21.484
BUT FIRST WELL GLAD TO HAVE

01:00:21.551 --> 01:00:22.085
MISTER GALLAGHER BACK IN THE

01:00:22.151 --> 01:00:23.086
COMMITTEE --

01:00:23.152 --> 01:00:25.221
AND I WOULD LIKE --

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:27.023
TO TO SAY A FEW THOUGHTS ON THIS.

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:28.358
VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THE

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:32.395
AUTHOR IS ADDRESSING THE REALITY --

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:32.895
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:36.399
CHILDREN WHO OPPORTUNITY TO BE

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:37.867
WHO THEY ARE --

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:39.268
I DISCUSS THIS BILL WITH MY WIFE

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:40.770
LAST NIGHT SHE MANAGES A FOSTER

01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:43.006
CARE PROGRAM AND SHE WILL TELL

01:00:43.072 --> 01:00:43.606
YOU.

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:46.943
AND THE COMMUNITY OF FOLKS WHO

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:47.744
WORK WITH FOSTER CARE CARE

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:49.679
CHILDREN WILL TELL YOU JUST HOW

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:51.447
MUCH INCREDIBLE HURT THERE HAS

01:00:51.514 --> 01:00:52.648
ALREADY BEEN --

01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:54.450
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT

01:00:54.517 --> 01:00:55.685
CHILDREN CONTINUE TO BE DENIED

01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:57.353
THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WHO THEY

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:59.088
ARE AND THE SUGGESTION THAT WE

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:00.556
SHOULD NOT ADDRESS THAT AS

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:01.991
QUICKLY AS WE CAN --

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:04.027
IT IS ONE THAT I SIMPLY DISAGREE

01:01:04.093 --> 01:01:05.028
WITH I ALSO WANNA JUST TAKE THE

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:06.496
MOMENT I KNOW THERE WERE SOME

01:01:06.562 --> 01:01:08.231
REFERENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THE

01:01:08.297 --> 01:01:09.265
SUPREME COURT.

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:10.800
HAS WAITED ON THIS IS AND I

01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:12.468
THINK ARE THE OPPONENTS OF THIS

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:14.137
BILL WOULD KNOW THAT BILL WAS IN

01:01:14.203 --> 01:01:16.139
A VERY DIFFERENT CONTEXT I DON'T

01:01:16.205 --> 01:01:17.540
THINK ONE COULD SAY --

01:01:17.607 --> 01:01:18.941
THAT THE CONTEXT OF THE NEW FLU

01:01:19.008 --> 01:01:20.777
DECISION HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:21.377
THE SUBJECT THAT WE'RE TALKING

01:01:21.444 --> 01:01:22.378
ABOUT TODAY.

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:24.247
AND I WOULD ALSO SAY --

01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:26.315
RESPECTING THE PERSPECTIVE THAT

01:01:26.382 --> 01:01:27.417
IS BROUGHT BY THE OPPONENTS I

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:29.352
KNOW -- IT

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:30.920
COMES FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE OF

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:34.357
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE CHRISTIAN I

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:34.991
WOULD JUST SAY AS A CHURCH GOING

01:01:35.058 --> 01:01:35.825
CHRISTIAN [inaudible]

01:01:35.892 --> 01:01:36.559
MYSELF.

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:37.660
THE GREATEST COMMANDMENT THAT WE

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:39.595
HAVE IS TO LOVE AND I THINK

01:01:39.662 --> 01:01:42.698
FUNDAMENTALLY THIS BILL IS ABOUT.

01:01:42.765 --> 01:01:44.801
IS ABOUT SAYING THAT WE RESPECT

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:46.402
AND LOVE CHILDREN THE FOSTER

01:01:46.469 --> 01:01:49.038
CARE SYSTEM AND WE WANT THEM. TO

01:01:49.105 --> 01:01:49.639
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WHO

01:01:49.705 --> 01:01:52.608
THEY WANT WITH THAT.

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:53.709
HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND

01:26:23.578 --> 01:26:25.380
THAT IS FAIRLY CLEAR THAT IT

01:26:25.446 --> 01:26:28.016

01:26:28.082 --> 01:26:29.884
WE LOOK AT WHERE WE'VE ALLOW

01:26:29.951 --> 01:26:32.053
THESE PRIVILEGES BEFORE.

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:34.155
THE THE NATURE OF COMMUNICATIONS

01:26:34.222 --> 01:26:35.690

01:26:35.757 --> 01:26:37.225
OF THE INDIVIDUALS IS IS WHAT WE

01:26:37.292 --> 01:26:38.726
LOOK AT THE I THINK THE

01:26:38.793 --> 01:26:40.528
OPPOSITION THAT WAS COLOR BRINGS

01:26:40.595 --> 01:26:41.162
UP AN INTERESTING POINT IN THAT

01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:42.330
THIS.

01:26:42.397 --> 01:26:45.633
PRIVILEGES HELD SORT OF BY TWO

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:46.100
DIFFERENT POTENTIALLY

01:26:46.167 --> 01:26:48.403
CONFLICTING AREAS AND I THINK

01:26:48.469 --> 01:26:50.271
FROM MY STANDPOINT THE BILL IS

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:51.406
SATISFACTORY I'M RECOMMENDING

01:26:53.308 --> 01:26:53.775
OUT TODAY.

01:26:53.841 --> 01:26:55.643
I THINK THAT'S ONE CRITICISM YOU

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:57.211
MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT HIS

01:26:57.278 --> 01:26:58.947
IN EACH OF THESE CASES IT IS THE

01:26:59.013 --> 01:27:00.448
DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION

01:27:00.515 --> 01:27:01.849

ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE CONCERN

01:27:12.594 --> 01:27:13.861
BUT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

01:27:13.928 --> 01:27:15.330
WORTH LOOKING AT AS THE BILL

IN THE VIEW OF OUR MEMBERS WE

01:33:39.613 --> 01:33:41.682
THINK THIS BILL IS SO RADICAL IN

01:33:44.785 --> 01:33:45.987
THAT IT WILL EFFECTIVELY

01:33:46.053 --> 01:33:47.555

01:34:31.465 --> 01:34:32.767

CALIFORNIA ALREADY PROVIDES

01:36:04.692 --> 01:36:05.993
IT'S JUST AN INVITATION TO

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:21.142
WHERE NOW UNDER CURRENT LAW THE

01:36:21.208 --> 01:36:22.676
EMPLOYER HAS TO HAVE SOME NOTICE

01:36:22.743 --> 01:36:24.278

EMPLOYEE IF THERE IS IS?

01:36:25.579 --> 01:36:27.248
PROBLEMATIC AND THEN DIDN'T DO

01:36:27.314 --> 01:36:29.283
ANYTHING TO CHANGE THIS

01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:31.185
BASICALLY SAYS IT'S A WAR SO

STRICT LIABILITY FOR CASES ARE

01:36:38.425 --> 01:36:39.226
ALMOST.

01:36:39.293 --> 01:36:46.700
IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEND SO --

01:36:46.767 --> 01:36:49.603
POINT AND WILL DRIVE THE

01:36:49.670 --> 01:36:50.905
INSURANCE INDUSTRY AWAY FROM

THIS KIND OF COVERAGE IN THAT

01:36:52.273 --> 01:36:53.974
WILL ACTUALLY RESULT IN

01:36:54.041 --> 01:36:55.075
SITUATIONS.

01:36:55.142 --> 01:36:56.410

01:41:39.393 --> 01:41:40.294
IT'S IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:42.496
OPPOSITION AND I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:41:42.563 --> 01:41:43.497
IS IS FISCAL.

01:41:43.564 --> 01:41:45.732
BUT ONE THINGS THAT.

01:41:45.799 --> 01:41:47.401
WE LOSE IF WE ONLY LOOK AT

01:41:47.468 --> 01:41:50.070
FISCAL IS THE DAMAGE AND IN THE

01:41:50.137 --> 01:41:51.738
INDIVIDUALS THE VICTIMS WHO WHO

01:41:51.805 --> 01:41:52.973
HAD BEEN HURT.

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.441
AND LOOKING FORWARD I WOULD HOPE

01:41:54.508 --> 01:41:55.776
WE PUT IN PLACE ALL OF THE

01:41:55.843 --> 01:41:57.511
PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES TO

01:41:57.578 --> 01:41:59.146
PREVENT THIS FOR THE FUTURE.

01:41:59.213 --> 01:42:00.481
BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:42:00.547 --> 01:42:01.882
LIVING.

01:42:01.949 --> 01:42:04.384
TRYING TO LIVE WITH A GREAT DEAL

01:42:04.451 --> 01:42:06.119
OF EMOTIONAL TRAUMA AND OTHER

01:42:06.186 --> 01:42:09.223
ISSUES AND SINCE IT SEEMS TO BE

01:42:09.289 --> 01:42:10.557
IN OUR CULTURE.

01:42:10.624 --> 01:42:12.559
THE REMEDY FOR ALL KINDS OF HARM

01:42:12.626 --> 01:42:14.127
IS MONEY.

01:42:14.194 --> 01:42:15.629
WRITE A CHECK AND YOU'RE ALL

01:42:15.696 --> 01:42:17.064
BETTER WHICH WE KNOW IS NOT

01:42:17.130 --> 01:42:18.298
EXACTLY TRUE.

01:42:18.365 --> 01:42:19.566
I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE TO DO AND

01:42:19.633 --> 01:42:21.368
SO ARBITRARILY KIND OF CLOSING

01:42:21.435 --> 01:42:24.872
THE DOOR. TO AND THEN STATURE

01:42:24.938 --> 01:42:26.139
LIMITATIONS ARE ARBITRARY

01:42:26.206 --> 01:42:27.407
STATEMENTS EIGHT CLOSING THE

01:42:27.474 --> 01:42:30.744
DOOR. TO DO THAT THE ONE REMEDY

01:42:30.811 --> 01:42:32.779
MONEY THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT WE

01:42:32.846 --> 01:42:34.081
CAN PROVIDE.

01:42:34.147 --> 01:42:34.982
IS.

01:42:35.048 --> 01:42:36.083
IS A REAL CHALLENGE SO I

01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:37.684
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE FISCAL

01:42:37.751 --> 01:42:40.153
IMPACT I THINK THAT'S BUT THAT'S

01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:41.889
NOT THE QUESTION HERE.

01:42:41.955 --> 01:42:42.956
SINCE THE APPROPRIATIONS OR

01:42:43.023 --> 01:42:44.691
SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING TO NEED TO

01:42:44.758 --> 01:42:45.926
DEAL WITH THAT.

01:42:45.993 --> 01:42:47.928
FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT

01:42:47.995 --> 01:42:49.363
ENSURING THAT VICTIMS.

01:42:49.429 --> 01:42:51.098
HAVE REDRESS THAT'S REALLY WHAT

01:42:51.164 --> 01:42:52.966
THIS BILL IS ABOUT AND THAT'S

01:42:53.033 --> 01:42:53.400
WHY I ENJOY THAT AYE

01:42:53.467 --> 01:42:54.668
RECOMMENDATION.

01:42:54.735 --> 01:42:55.569
OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM

01:42:55.636 --> 01:42:58.872
COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

01:42:58.939 --> 01:43:01.008
RIGHT SIGNAL SKINS US TO MAKE

01:43:01.074 --> 01:43:01.742
LOVE WELL --

01:43:01.808 --> 01:43:02.409
IN SOME WAY I'M HEARTENED THAT I

01:43:02.476 --> 01:43:04.278
FINALLY GOT AN ESTIMATED COST

01:43:04.344 --> 01:43:05.612
FROM SCHOOLS IN ANOTHER WAY I'M

01:43:05.679 --> 01:43:06.813
HORRIFIED.

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:08.415
BECAUSE IF WE THINK THAT BECAUSE

01:43:08.482 --> 01:43:10.050
OF COVER UPS THAT THEY CLEARLY

01:43:10.117 --> 01:43:12.486
KNOW ABOUT IN INCIDENCES OF

01:43:12.553 --> 01:43:15.055
ABUSE THAT THEY CLEARLY KNOW

01:43:15.122 --> 01:43:15.255
ABOUT.

01:43:15.322 --> 01:43:16.223
THAT THERE'S HUNDREDS OF

01:43:16.290 --> 01:43:17.324
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DAMAGE OF

01:43:17.391 --> 01:43:18.425
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF DAMAGE OF

01:43:18.492 --> 01:43:19.326
SUITS THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

01:43:19.393 --> 01:43:21.194
BE AND I HEARD THIS THEY'RE JUST

01:43:21.261 --> 01:43:23.430
GOING TO HAVE TO BE SETTLED --

01:43:23.497 --> 01:43:25.432
THAT THAT THE LACK OF EVIDENCE

01:43:25.499 --> 01:43:27.401
GOES ON BOTH SIDES AFTER YEARS

01:43:27.467 --> 01:43:28.936
SO IF THEY'RE SUGGESTING THESE

01:43:29.002 --> 01:43:30.938
NUMBERS I I WOULD SUGGEST THAT

01:43:31.004 --> 01:43:32.105
THEY'VE KNOWN ABOUT THIS FOR A

01:43:32.172 --> 01:43:32.739
LONG TIME AND THEY'VE HELD THE

01:43:32.806 --> 01:43:35.175
KEYS TO CHANGING BEHAVIOR.

01:43:35.242 --> 01:43:37.477
I HAVE ANOTHER BILL TO TO DEAL

01:43:37.544 --> 01:43:39.713
WITH THAT SITUATION BUT IT'S

01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:41.281
MONEY IS IT IS NOT.

01:43:41.348 --> 01:43:42.115
THE PANACEA OUR SITE SHOULDN'T

01:43:42.182 --> 01:43:44.151
BE.

01:43:44.217 --> 01:43:46.453
BUT UNTIL YOU MAKE PEOPLE HURT

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:48.021
THIS BEHAVIOR DOESN'T STOP AND

01:43:48.088 --> 01:43:49.923
WE'VE SEEN THAT THIS WAS THIS

01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:51.692
WAS TALKED ABOUT YEARS AGO IN

01:43:51.758 --> 01:43:52.960
THIS BUILDING PEOPLE MIL.

01:43:53.026 --> 01:43:53.260
YOU KNOW --

01:43:53.327 --> 01:43:55.295
WE CAN WE CAN OPEN UP FOR A YEAR

01:43:55.362 --> 01:43:57.464
AND WILL TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF

01:43:57.531 --> 01:43:58.398
HURT AND THEN WE'LL MOVE FORWARD

01:43:58.465 --> 01:44:01.535
AND YET THIS CONTINUES TO HAPPEN.

01:44:01.602 --> 01:44:03.103
I WOULD I WOULD CLEAN THAT

01:44:03.170 --> 01:44:05.372
PROTECTING OUR CHILDREN IS THE

01:44:05.439 --> 01:44:06.506
MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO

01:44:06.573 --> 01:44:07.975
AND PROTECTING OUR CHILDREN IN

01:44:08.041 --> 01:44:10.177
PARTICULAR FROM CHILDHOOD SEXUAL

01:44:10.243 --> 01:44:11.244
ASSAULT.

01:44:11.311 --> 01:44:12.279
SOMETHING THAT WILL STAY WITH

01:44:12.346 --> 01:44:13.380
THEM AND WE KNOW STAYS WITHIN

01:44:13.447 --> 01:44:14.815
THEIR ENTIRE LIFE.

01:44:14.881 --> 01:44:16.717
IN AN UPSET EVERY ASPECT OF

01:44:16.783 --> 01:44:18.051
THEIR LIFE AND WE'RE SEEING MORE

01:44:18.118 --> 01:44:19.620
AND MORE THAT IT TAKES YEARS AND

01:44:19.686 --> 01:44:21.421
SOMETIMES DECADES TO DEAL WITH

01:44:21.488 --> 01:44:22.889
THAT TYPE OF PAIN.

01:44:22.956 --> 01:44:24.925
IF WE DON'T GET SERIOUS ABOUT

01:44:24.992 --> 01:44:26.960
THE COVER UP OF ADULTS WHO ARE

01:44:27.027 --> 01:44:28.395
HURTING CHILDREN SOMETHING THAT

01:44:28.462 --> 01:44:30.497
HAS HAPPENED SYSTEMATICALLY IN

01:44:30.564 --> 01:44:32.099
THIS COUNTRY FOR FAR TOO LONG IN

01:44:32.165 --> 01:44:33.100
THE STATE.

01:44:33.166 --> 01:44:35.402
THEN WE WILL NEVER STOP IT IN

01:44:35.469 --> 01:44:36.803
THE FUTURE.

01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:37.504
SOMEBODY WHO ABUSES HAS ON

01:44:37.571 --> 01:44:41.308
AVERAGE OF FIFTY ONE VICTIMS

01:44:41.375 --> 01:44:41.975
FIFTY ONE YEAH I WANT TO PUT IN

01:44:42.042 --> 01:44:42.943
PLACE SOMETHING.

01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:43.977
THAT'LL PREVENT.

01:44:44.044 --> 01:44:45.445
