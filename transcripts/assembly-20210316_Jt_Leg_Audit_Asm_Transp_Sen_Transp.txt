NOW MOVING UNDER HEARING TODAY WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE AUDITOR AND THE AUDIT REPORT RELEASED JUST LAST MONTH TITLED. CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD IMPROVE PROGRAM MEASUREMENT WOULD HELP CALIFORNIA WORK MORE STRATEGICALLY TO MEET ITS CLIMATE. FIRST I WANT TO THANK US SENATOR BRADFORD FOR REQUESTING THIS AUDIT REGARDING THE TRANSPORTATION RELATED GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION PROGRAMS OVERSEEN BY CARB. IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE THE CALIFORNIA'S ME TREMENDOUS STRIDES IN REDUCING GHG. IMPROVING PUBLIC HEALTH FOR MANY AND ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE. HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL LARGE AREAS OF OUR STATE I KNOW LIKE FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY FOR INSTANCE I WHERE I RESIDE THAT WHERE THE AIR QUALITY RANKS AMONG THE WORST IN THE NATION. POLLUTED AIR IS LINKED TO A VARIETY OF HEALTH CONCERNS RANGING FROM. SERIOUS DISEASES OR EVEN PREMATURE DEATH NOT ONLY ARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS LIVING IN POLLUTED AREAS WHERE THEY ARE EXPERIENCING HIGHER HEALTH RISKS BUT SOME ARE ALSO LIVING IN EXTREME POVERTY. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS HAVE CARRIED THE DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE. THEREFORE IT IS CRITICAL THAT IN ADDITION TO REDUCING HG EMISSIONS. THE PROGRAMS OVERSEEN BY CARP SHOULD ALSO ACHIEVE SOCIAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS. PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE RESIDING AND DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. MOREOVER I BELIEVE THAT GHG POLICIES AND PROGRAMS IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR MUST BE APPLIED FAIRLY AND EQUITABLY IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE EFFECTIVE. HOWEVER IN LATE TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE RELEASED A REPORT ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND BENEFITS. OF CALIFORNIA STATUTORY GHG EMISSION GOALS AND THAT LEFT ME AND MANY OTHERS WITH MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS. OR FOUND THAT THE OVERALL ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND BENEFITS OF THESE PROGRAMS AND POLICIES ARE LARGELY UNCLEAR. THE ALEJO'S FINDINGS LEFT ME WONDERING. HOW THE STATE COULD SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AIMED AT LOWERING GHG BULAK PROGRAM MEASUREMENTS TO GUIDE ITS INVESTMENTS. THE OTHER REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED BY THE STATE AUDITOR LAST MONTH CERTAINLY RAISES SIMILAR QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS SPECIFICALLY IT FOUND THAT CAR HAS NOT DONE ENOUGH TO MEASURE THE GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS- IN ITS INDIVIDUAL TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY IT HAS NOT COLLECTED OR EVALUATED SUFFICIENT DATA TO ALLOW TO DETERMINE WHETHER. OR HOW ITS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS WITHOUT PROGRAM MEASUREMENTS WE DO NOT KNOW THE VALUE FOR EACH DOLLAR WE ARE INVESTING TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE ARE HAVING THE BEST IMPACT FOR THAT DOLLAR IN OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. ADDITIONALLY THE REPORT FOUND THAT CARBON IS NOT CONSISTENTLY COLLECTED OR ANALYZED DATA TO DETERMINE WHETHER SOME OF ITS PROGRAMS PROVIDE THE SOCIAL SOCIAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIANS LIVING IN ENVIRONMENTALLY DISADVANTAGED DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS LOW AND MODERATE INCOME COMMUNITIES. I LOOK FORWARD TO A REPOSE ROBUST AND MUCH NEEDED DISCUSSION TODAY REGARDING THE AUTO REPORT- WITH. WITH THE AGENCY IN DOING A POEM IN IMPLEMENTING THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE GOALS AT THIS TIME I DO WANNA MENTION ANOTHER HOUSEKEEPING. ITEM BEFORE WE PROCEED FORWARD A FEW HOUSEKEEPING ITEMS TO ENSURE WE CAN HEAR FROM EVERYONE ASKED THE PANEL KEEP THE PRESIDENT PRESENTATIONS TO THE TIME ALLOTTED. AND- WHAT THAT'LL ME GO AHEAD INVITE EITHER ASSEMBLY MEMBER FREE OR SENATOR GONZALEZ FOR OPENING REMARKS. AND OKAY WELL I FIRST WANT TO THANK MY CLLEAGUES FOR BRINGING LIKE THIS A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC AND FOR ALLOWING CARP TO HIGHLIGHT THEIR WORK AS WELL AND FOR US TO DO A DEEP DIVE A LITTLE BIT INTO THEIR WORK I'VE CLIMATE CHANGE- RIGHT NOW IS CERTAINLY ON EVERYONE'S MIND IN FEW BELIEVE IN SCIENCE WHICH I DO AND LISTEN TO SCIENTISTS CLIMATE CHANGE AND CLIMATE IMPACTS IN THE FUTURE IF WE DON'T TAKE RADICAL ACTION ARE GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT THIS THAT ANYONE IN RECENT MEMORY HAS EVER FACED. IT'S SOMETHING THAT I WORRY ABOUT EVERY DAY I WORRY ABOUT MY DAUGHTER AND THE PLANET THAT SHE'S GOING TO INHERIT I WORRY ABOUT OUR OWN STATE AND OUR CONSTITUENTS AND THERE WILL HOW THEY WILL ADJUST TO CLIMATE CHANGE TO DROUGHT TO THE TYPES OF CROPS THAT WERE ABLE TO ARE NOT ABLE TO GROW IN CALIFORNIA TO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO OUR COASTLINE TO OUR COMMUNITIES THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TAKE EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY. NOW THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR HAS STRUGGLED FOR MANY YEARS WITH GHG REDUCTIONS IN THE CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE IN. IN MY MIND IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE TYPE OF FUEL THAT'S USED. IT'S ALSO HAS- HAS TO DO WITH LAND USE POLICIES. AND HOW WE ALLOW PEOPLE ARE DOING ALLOW PEOPLE TO MOVE AROUND THEIR COMMUNITIES- IT'S ABOUT WHERE WE LIVE IT OUT WE CAN AFFORD TO LIVE IT'S ABOUT WHAT WE- NEED TO GET TO HAVE OUR LIVES. BEYOND A MANY OF THESE ISSUES GO WELL BEYOND CARBS OR CARBS OF THIRTY. AND SO I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THERE'S A LOT OF FACTORS THAT GO INTO. HOW PEOPLE MOVE AROUND THE COMMUNITY HOW THEY DRIVE AND WHAT CAR WAS ABLE TO DO AND NOT ABLE TO DO. THAT I WANT TO SAY JUST KIND OF OUTSIDE OF THIS TOPIC A LITTLE BIT I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE MOVE FORWARD THAT WE DECIDE LOW A LOT OF THESE CONVERSATIONS TRANSPORTATION LAND USE HOUSING. THEY'RE ALL PART OF A LARGER. CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO BE MORE HOLISTIC. I AM CHAIRING A NEW SELECT COMMITTEE AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT T COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE. AND I INVITE ALL OF YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT. I DO TODAY WANT TO DIVE INTO TALK ABOUT FEASIBLE REALISTIC CHANGES THAT CAN BE MADE. WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ANSWERS TO SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS MIGHT VERY WELL BE ON NOBLE. AND I HOPE TO COME AWAY TODAY WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION. CAN WORK TOGETHER. TO BETTER TACKLE- THIS HUGE CHALLENGE AND OUR GOALS AND THANKS AGAIN FOR. HOLDING THIS HEARING. THANK YOU OUR CHAIRWOMAN- FRIEDMAN WILL MOVE NOW TO WHERE SENATE TRANSPORTATION CHAIR SENATOR LENA GONZALEZ. THANK YOU SHARE SALAS- I'D LIKE TO FIRST START BY THINKING YOU- THE CHAIR OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE AS WELL AS CHAIR. OF THE ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE LAURA FRIEDMAN- WHO'S BEEN A PARTNER WITH ME OVER THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS AND TRANSPORTATION ISSUE AND POLICIES- AS WE KNOW STATEWIDE MORE THAN TWENTY EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN AREAS THAT EXCEED. OZONE AND PARTICULATE MATTER STANDARDS ONE OF THOSE HAPPENS TO BE IN MY OWN DISTRICT- THERE ARE MANY LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER POLLUTION LEVELS WHICH HAVE SERIOUS HEALTH. IMPACTS MY DISTRICT INCLUDES THE PORT OF LONG BEACH IN PART OF THE SEVEN TEN CORRIDOR WHICH ARE HUGE JOB DRIVERS. BUT THEY ALSO CREATE SEVERE AIR QUALITY CHALLENGES SO WE NEED A STRATEGIC AND DEDICATED INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY AND PROGRAMS TO DEVELOP CLEAN FREIGHT CORRIDORS AND GET CLEAN. HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES IMPORT EQUIPMENT AND USE- ALONG OUR CORRIDORS FOR BETTER AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. AND ON THE LIGHT DUTY SIDE HALF OF ALL EV'S SOLD IN THE U. S. HAVE BEEN RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE. THAT EVERYONE CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE ZERO EMISSION FUTURE ADDRESSING BARRIERS. ENSURING AGAIN THAT LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS ARE AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE. THE LEGISLATURE HAS CREATED OR FUNDED MANY PROGRAMS TO ACHIEVE THESE BENEFITS AND OF COURSE THIS YEAR WE'RE CONSIDERING A ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR. ACROSS INCENTIVES AND INFRASTRUCTURES. I'M ENCOURAGED THAT THE AUDIT HAS FOUND SOME- OPPORTUNITIES WHERE- THEY'VE EXIT EXCEEDED MINIMUM SPENDING REQUIREMENTS FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK DEEPER THAN THAT LET HIGH LEVEL METRIC AT THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE NOW AND ENSURING THAT THEIR INTENDED. OUTCOMES ARE REALLY ACHIEVING WHAT WE NEED FOR THESE COMMUNITIES. WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A LOT MORE TO DO. AND ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND ENSURING THAT THEY'RE TOUGH QUESTIONS AND ANALYZING THE RIGHT INFORMATION AND USING IT TO IMPROVE EXISTING PROGRAMS CAN DEFINITELY HELP US GET HERE AND I KNOW THIS COMMITTEE CAN CERTAINLY DO THAT. WITHOUT AGAIN I WANT TO SAY THANK. THANK YOU SENATOR- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO CENTER LAYERED THE VICE CHAIR OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE ACCESS. CAN UP. JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE BUT AT THAT. THIS POINT I'D LIKE TO UPDATE. THE ACCESS CODE THE ACCESS CODE HAS BEEN UPDATED FOR THE CALL IN NUMBER OF THE CALL IN NUMBER AGAIN WAS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN THE UPDATED ACCESS CODE IS FORTY TWO ZERO TWO. THIRTEEN FIFTEEN. AGAIN THAT ACCESS CODE IS. FOUR TWO ZERO TWO ONE THREE ONE FIVE AND WHAT THAT WILL MOVE TO SENATOR ALERT PLEASE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHIP. ARM THE N. R. I APPRECIATE HAVING A HEARING AND BE HERE WITH POST TRANSPORTATION CHAIRS AS WELL. I WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE OF FIFTEEN YEARS pADOPTED AND IT WAS BASICALLY A BI PARTISAN EFFORT PASSED BY A DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED BY REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR. TO DO. AT THE STATE LEVEL WHAT WAS WALKED AWAY FROM AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. THERE WERE THE KEY AUTO ACCORDS AND AB THIRTY TWO BASICALLY SAID WE WOULD APPLY THOSE TO CALIFORNIA IN THE ABSENCE OF OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WALKING AWAY FROM THEM. AND IT'S SET THE GOAL THAT WE WOULD BY TWENTY TWENTY GO BACK TO THE EMISSIONS LEVEL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LEVEL BY NINETEEN NINETY. ARE THAT BILL PLACED THE AUTHORITY FOR THAT PROGRAM AND ALL THE SUPPORTED FOR FISCAL AND- AN ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD THAT'S WHAT BROUGHT US HERE TODAY. AND WE HAVE MET THOSE GOALS OF THAT VERY HIGH GOAL WAS MET SO AND NOW THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE GOVERNOR HAS SET NEW GOALS ON BOTH THAT AND OTHER CLIMATE ACTIVITIES. SO IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE THAT WE DO A CHECK IN A CHECK IN ABOUT WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES WORKING AND IT'S EFFECTIVE WHETHER INJURE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GOALS. ARE BEING MET WHETHER WE HAVE MEASUREMENTS TO SEE. BUT IT'S ALSO APPROPRIATE NOT TO TAKE OUR PIE OFF THESE GOALS THAT IS WHAT IS IN FRONT OF US. BECAUSE THE NATION LOOKS TO CALIFORNIA FOR OUR LEADERSHIP ON THESE ISSUES AND WE'VE PROVIDED SO I THINK THIS HEARING. WILL GIVE US A GOOD CHANCE TO HAVE A CHECK AND BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE DON'T TAKE OUR EYE OFF OF WHERE WE HAVE TO HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR ALLOWING ME TO MAKE OPENING COME BACK THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED WITH THAT- WE WILL GO. AHEAD AND MOVE TO OUR FIRST HAND ALL THIS IS A ITEM TWO OVERVIEW OF THE ID OF THE CAL AIR RESOURCES BOARD WE HAVE JOINING US OUR CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR ELAINE HOWLE- TAMMY LOZANO OF PRINCIPLE AND MARK- RIGHT RT AUDIT SUPERVISOR KNOWS WE'RE GETTING READY FOR THEM. I DO WANT TO JUST MENTION AND THANK- THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE IN ATTENDANCE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN SENATOR GONZALEZ ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER SENATOR LAYER ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG. SENATOR DOLLY AND REMOTELY WE HAVE I BELIEVE TWENTY THREE MEMBERS JOINING US REMOTELY THAT'S ASSEMBLY MEMBER KILEY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL SENATOR BACKER CENTER GLAZER SENATOR HERTZBERG SENATOR NELSON. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON ASSEMBLY MEMBER NAZARIAN SIMPLY MEMBER WHEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARS AND ONE MEMBER WICKS SENATOR BATES. SENATE ARCHER LETTER THE SENATOR MCGUIRE CENTER MELENDEZ SENATOR MAN SENATOR RUBIO. SENATOR SKINNER SENATOR MCCASKEY SENATOR ALAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA ASSEMBLY MEMBER EARLY. AND WHAT THAT WAS GOING TO MOVE. TO OUR- CALIFORNIA REESE BOARD PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS- I'M MY NAME'S ELAINE HALL IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR AND MARK RANDY AND I WILL BE PRESENTING INFORMATION RELATED TO AN AUDIT WE ISSUED IN FEBRUARY R. AS TO CAR AND ITS EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT AB THIRTY TWO AND OTHER PROGRAMS AND SO WE HAVE THREE KEY ISSUES THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER AYE WE PROVIDED A PACKET OF FOR A FOUR PAGE PACKET TO THE COMMITTEE- I'M GOING TO BE REVIEWING AND GOING OVER THE FIRST PAGE AND THEN MISTER REGNERY WILL STEP YOU THROUGH THE- FOLLOWING THREE PAGES AND BASICALLY WHAT THOSE PAGES WILL DO WILL ILLUSTRATE. EACH OF THE KEY KEY ISSUES THAT I'M GOING TO DISCUSS SO THE FIRST ISSUE AS AS SOME OF THE MEMBERS THAT INTRODUCED IT. NUMBER FRIEDMAN MISTER SALAS AND GONZALEZ IS THERE ARE IMPORTANT PROGRAMS THAT CALIFORNIA ADMINISTERS- BUT WHAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IN THE FIRST ISSUE IS WHETHER OR NOT CARD IS ABLE TO. PROPERLY MEASURE THE EFFECT OF THOSE PROGRAMS AND WE HAVE REGULATORY PROGRAMS REQUIRED PROGRAMS AND THEN WE ALSO CERTAINLY HAVE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND THOSE PROGRAMS AND MANY CASES WORK TOGETHER. ON THE ISSUE WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA IS CARD DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY OR DOESN'T AT THIS POINT IN TIME. HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF MEASURING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHAT GHG EMISSION BENEFITS AS CALIFORNIA RECEIVING FROM ITS REGULATORY PROGRAMS VERSES IT'S INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THE REASON THAT'S IMPORTANT IS AS CALIFORNIA. DECIDES TO INVEST MORE AND MORE DOLLARS INTO INCENTIVE PROGRAMS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE INVESTING IN THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE MOST BENEFICIAL TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE IN REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS AND CERTAINLY- CREATING- SOCIOECONOMIC BENEFITS OFFER COMMUNITIES DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES SO THE FIRST KEY ISSUE IS. WHETHER OR NOT CARD AND WE FOUND A CAR DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY RIGHT NOW WE THINK THEY CAN AND SHOULD. BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE BENEFITS DERIVED FROM ITS REGULATORY PROGRAMS VERSUS ITS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. THE REASON THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL IN ADDITION TO INVESTING IN THE APPROPRIATE PROGRAMS IS. A WE HAVE A VERY AGGRESSIVE. ALL OF READ. GHG EMISSIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY AND IT HAS TO BE REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY WE'RE GONNA SPEAKING ABOUT TRANSPORTATION SECTOR THAT'S SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE AUDIT COMMITTEE MR BRADFORD'S REQUEST ASK US TO LOOK AT. BECAUSE THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. PASSENGER VEHICLES TRUCKS- HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS ETCETERA. ARE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA GREENHOUSE GASES- SO THAT'S THE SECTOR THAT CALIFORNIA REALLY NEEDS TO FOCUS ON IN FACT THAT SECTOR OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS CONTINUES TO SHOW AN INCREASE IN EMISSIONS RATHER THAN A DECREASE IN THE NATION SO. THERE REALLY DOES NEED TO BE A FOCUS ON THIS PARTICULAR SECTOR AND THOSE REGULATORY PROGRAMS AS WELL AS THE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS SO THAT'S THE FIRST ISSUE THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT- AND MR WRITER REAL STEPPING THROUGH SOME MORE SPECIFICS RELATED TO THAT. THE SECOND ISSUE IS THE SOCIO ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THE LEGISLATURE CLEARLY HAD INTENTION AT SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS WOULD BENEFIT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LOW INCOME YOU LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES- AND ACTUALLY REQUIRED CARD TO INVEST A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FUNDING IN THOSE COMMUNITIES 25% DISADVANTAGED. 10% AND LOW INCOME IN THE AGGREGATE CALIFORNIA IS DOING THAT WE ARE INVESTING A LOT. MORE THAN THAT THOSE PARTICULAR PERCENTAGES. THE PROBLEM WE FOUND WITH THIS PARTICULAR AREA IS CARD NOT DOING AS GOOD A JOB AS IT SHOULD AND IS REQUIRED TO DO TO MEASURE WHETHER OR NOT THOSE SOCIOECONOMIC BENEFITS ARE OCCURRING IN THOSE COMMUNITIES- I'M SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT- LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. AND SOME OF THE JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT THAT CARB INTENDED TO ESTABLISH AND FUND WHETHER OR NOT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDING JOB TRAINING TO INDIVIDUALS IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES SO THEY CAN GAIN EMPLOYMENT IN THIS INDUSTRY. IN ADDITION THERE WERE SOME REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO JOB CREATION HI OF JOBS THAT THESE PROGRAMS SUPPORT. AND SO WE EXPECTED TO SEE BETTER MEASUREMENT BY CARD AS TO THOSE BENEFITS AND IN FACT CARBS OWN GUIDELINES FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN THEY ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN REQUIRED THEM TO TRACK SOME OF THIS INFORMATION. AND MAY NOT ARE NOT DOING AS GOOD A JOB IN TRACKING AND CERTAINLY REPORTING THIS INFORMATION TO LEGISLATURE AS THEY COULD AND SHOULD BE DOING. SO IN THE AREA OF SOCIOECONOMIC BENEFITS EVEN THOUGH IN THE AGGREGATE AGAIN THEY ARE INVESTING IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN LINE CAN COMMUNITIES THE IMPORTANT ASPECT IS ARE THEY MEASURING. BY INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES BY REGIONS WITHIN THE STATE ARE THEY MEASURING TO DETERMINE WHETHER JOBS ARE BEING CREATED JOB TRAINING IS BEING SUPPORTED INDIVIDUALS ARE RECEIVING BENEFITS- THAT MAKE THEIR LIVES BETTER. ONE PARTICULAR PROGRAM AS AN EXAMPLE WE MENTIONED IN THE REPORT IS A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THIS IS A PROGRAM WHERE LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS CAN EITHER RECEIVE A GRANT OR FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO BE ABLE TO PURCHASE. A A. AS ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE- AND WHERE WE'RE EXPECTING CARP TO BE ABLE TO TRACK THAT INFORMATION IS HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS ARE RECEIVING THOSE TYPES OF LOANS IS THE LOAN BEING PAID OFF BECAUSE ONE OF THE BENEFITS TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS NOT JUST THE VEHICLE. BUT ACTUALLY INCREASING THEIR CREDIT WORTHINESS OR THEIR FINANCIAL SITUATION BECAUSE NOW THEY HAVE A VEHICLE THAT MAY AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO GET A JOB- AND REDUCE THEIR TRANSPORTATION COST THOSE SORTS OF THINGS THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT. I THINK THE LEGISLATURE IN ENACTING LEGISLATION ARE PASSING LEGISLATION BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND AGAIN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN REALLY EXPECTED CARB I TO BE TRACKING THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION AT THIS MORE SPECIFIC. LEVEL RATHER THAN JUST IN THE AGGREGATE. THE THIRD AREA IS. TO THE FOR TWO AREAS IN THAT. THE INFORMATION THAT CARP REPORTS TO THE LEGISLATURE CLEARLY THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. TO THE LEGISLATURE IN CALIFORNIA THE ADMINISTRATION IN CALIFORNIA- AND TO BE ABLE TO BE PARTNERS WITH CARBS THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO HAVE THE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS AS TO. WHERE WE INVEST OUR MONEY AS HAVE BEEN- GONZALEZ INDICATED WHERE DO WE GET THE BACK BEST BANG FOR THE BALLOT BOX USE ME AS A STATE. AND IF WE ARE MEASURING THE BENEFITS OF THESE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS WE DON'T KNOW AS A STATE WHETHER OR NOT THOSE ARE THE PROGRAMS WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OR WE DON'T KNOW WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO MODIFY THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM TO MAKE IT MORE BENEFICIAL. TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO THE PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND CERTAINLY TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS SO WE HAD A MULTITUDE OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO OUR THE LEGEND TO THE ACT A. R. B. E. R. R. REQUIRING BETTER TRACKING OF DATA BETTER AND- ANALYSIS OF DATA. SEPARATING THE RESULTS OF THEIR REGULATORY PROGRAMS VERSUS THEIR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS PROVIDING ALL OF THIS INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PUBLIC SO PEOPLE REALLY DO UNDERSTAND. WHICH PROGRAMS ARE WORKING WHICH PROGRAMS PERHAPS ARE NOT WORKING AS WELL MAYBE NEED TO BE MODIFIED OR MADE MAYBE NEED TO BE ELIMINATED. SO I'M GONNA HAND IT OVER TO MR REINER HE'S GONNA STEP YOU THROUGH THE NEXT THREE. PAGES IT'S JUST THREE MORE PAGES OF THE GRASS OF THE GRAPHICS PACKAGE- AND THOSE THREE PAGES WILL ILLUSTRATE SOME OF WHAT I WAS JUST DISCUSSING. SOME HANDED OUT TO MARK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS MEMBERS OF THE CA FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS MARK OR DO YOU HAVE A THE OFFICE YOU PROVIDE ON THE PROJECT- AS THE STATE UNDERSTAND I'M GONNA WALK YOU THROUGH IN SLIGHTLY MORE DETAIL SOME OF THE ISSUE AREAS THAT SHE COVERED AND TOUCH ON OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THOSE AREAS- THE FIRST REALLY TO TALK ABOUT HAS TO DO WITH THAT THE STATE OF EMISSIONS AND IN CALIFORNIA AND I WON'T BE LABOR THAT DISCUSSION BECAUSE HONESTLY FOLKS ARE FAMILIAR AND WE COVERED SOME OF THAT ALREADY. BUT IF YOU WOULD TURN TO PAGE TWO OF YOUR PACKET YOU'LL SEE A FIGURE WE PRESENT IN THE REPORT THAT SHOWS THAT ALTHOUGH YES THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY JG ARE REMISSIONS GOALS HAVE BEEN MET THE COMPANY IS A LONG. WAY TO GO IN HIS TWENTY THIRTY GOALS AND BEYOND. I THINK WE AS A MOST RECENT DATA. CALIFORNIA USED TO REDUCE TOTAL GHG EMISSIONS BY ANOTHER FORTY PERCENT. GIVING HERE TO REACH ITS TWENTY THIRTY GOALS. AND HAS BEEN DISCUSSED TRANSPORTATION IS A HUGE. HUGE ELEMENT TO THAT THAT EFFORT. ARE CURRENTLY TRANSPORTATION ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 40% OF EMISSIONS IN THE STATE AND IT HAS BEEN. THAT MOST STUBBORN SECTOR IN TERMS OF NOT WANTING TO. FOLLOW SOME OF THE GAINS WE'VE SEEN. IN ELECTRICAL POWER GENERATION FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE BENEFITS OF SOLAR AND HYDROELECTRIC SO. TRANSPORTATION CONTINUES TO BE AN AREA WHERE WE HOPE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR GETTING RETURN ON INVESTMENT. TO THAT END OUR OPERATES A WIDE RANGE OF PROGRAMS DIRECTED AT DIFFERENT SECTORS OF TRANSPORTATION- SUCH AS DIFFERENT VEHICLE TYPES PASSENGER VEHICLES LIGHT DUTY TRUCKS ALL THE WAY UP TO HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS IN TRANSIT BUSES. EVEN FREIGHT AND SHIPPING- AND THOSE THOSE OBJECTIVES ARE. COVERED- GOALS LIKE THAT THE OBJECT CAR WANTS TO SEE. THAT SHE EVEN THOUGH IN THOSE THE VEHICLE AREAS IN- TO TRAINS. WHO REDUCTIONS IN OVERALL TRANSFER. GEN TO DO THAT AT THE STATE SAID. CARDS PROGRAMS BONTA JR TO CATEGORIES. REGULATORY AND IT'S FOR. ALSO READ- GROUPS OF BOTH ACROSS A WIDE RAGE OF YOU TYPE AND CHECK IF AREAS- REGULATION REGULATORY PROGRAM CONSIST OF THE RIGHT. AND THE- AND MEASURE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE REGULATIONS- GENERALLY THOSE REGULATIONS MAY BE DIRECTED ACT. VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS- SOME SOME KIND OF OUR NASCENT- REGULATIONS DIRECTED AT SOME SOME OF THE FRESHEST TIME. BUT THEY WOULD REQUIRE THE PRODUCTION IN SOME CASES THE SALE OF YOUR SPECIFIC TYPES OF CLEAN VEHICLES. OR MANDATE THE OVERALL EFFICIENCY- CLEANLINESS OF MANUFACTURERS OVERALL OFFERINGS OF VEHICLES. AND THEN THE INCENTIVE SIDE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE GENERALLY DIRECTED ACT INSURERS KNOWS MIGHT BE INDIVIDUAL CALIFORNIANS LOOKING TO BUY A NEW VEHICLE. ARE THEY MAY BE TRANSFERRED HE'S OUR COMPANIES. IN INTERESTED IN MORE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES SUCH AS TRUCKS AND BUSES. AND THE VERY PURPOSE OF THOSE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IS TO MOTIVATE CONSUMERS TO GO OUT AND PURCHASE THE COMMUTER VEHICLE ON THE OTHERWISE WHAT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SWEETER TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS AND DISCUSS TODAY IS GETTING THOSE CLEANER VEHICLES OUT ON THE ROAD AND KEEPING THEM THERE. THAT IS GOING TO GENERATE THE REDUCTION OVER WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAPPEN. THAT WE NEED TO SEE IN THE TRAFFIC. SO WITH THAT ALL ASKING TURN TO PAGE I GET LITTLE IN. AN OF SOMEBODY FROM AND HOW THEY- WHAT ARE FINE WERE RESPECT OUR- I'M IN STRAIGHT ABOUT. SO WE ARE FOCUSED ON HERE IS THE- OBJECTIVE RELAY TO ZERO EMISSION. AND CAL- YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT'S AN F. YOU EXAMPLE PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH WITH VEHICLES IN THE PROGRAMS. BUT AS I LIED TO YOU KNOW OUR TEAM REVIEWED- PROGRAMS ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT VEHICLE TYPES INCLUDING. AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT TRUCKS AND BUSES SO WE'RE OBVIOUSLY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS. BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THEM ILLUSTRATING OUR CONCLUSIONS WILL FOCUS ON UNDESERVEDLY ZERO ZERO. EMISSION VEHICLE OBJECTIVE HERE THAT- THE OBJECTIVE AS PUT FORTH IN CAR SCOPING PLAN AND THIS IS BACKED UP BY A SERIES OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS. IS TO PUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION JENSEN CALIFORNIA ROADS FIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. TOTAL FIVE MILLION ON THOSE ROADS BY TWENTY THIRTY THAT'S AN AMBITIOUS GOAL. IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THAT FARMERS OPERATING PROGRAMS THAT BOTH. IT SHOULD BE TOWARD THIS OBJECTIVE SO THAT'S WHAT THE STATE ARE WE SAYING THESE PROGRAMS. WORK TOGETHER OR AND POTENTIALLY OVERLAP- AND WEIRD OUR CHARGE WAS TO LOOK AND SEE HOW WELL CARVE DESIGNS AND MEASURES THOSE PROGRAMS TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS THESE OBJECTIVES. IS OBJECTIVES ARE GOING TO GET US TO OUR TWENTY THIRD GOAL. ON THE REGULATORY SIDE. OF THE MOST NOTABLE REGULATORY PROGRAM THERE IS DOES THAT REGULATION. THAT REQUIRES CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS TO- SUIT YOU- MANUFACTURE AND SELL CERTAIN PROPORTIONS OF VEHICLES. INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA. EVERY YEAR SO PROPORTION OF THEIR TOTAL SALES HAS TO BE. FOUND OUT. JEFF IS THEIR VEHICLES. I'M THE- INSECTICIDE CAR OPERATION AND PROGRAMS THAT ARE TARA AT THE STATE SAME. THOSE ARE SOME OF THE KNOWN PRO ARE. PETE THAT'S A VEHICLE READING PROGRAM AND THEN- THERE ARE ALSO SOME PROGRAMS ARE SLIGHTLY SMALLER IN SIZE. INCLUDING THE GREEN CROSS FOR ALL PROGRAM AND THE- FINANCING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. BUT IN ALL CASES THOSE PROGRAMS PROVIDE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO CONSUMERS TO MAKE TO. TO A MOTIVATE THEM TO pALREADY YOU'RE SEEING THE OVERLAP IS A REGULATION THAT REQUIRES THE SALE OF THESE VEHICLES IN PART AND THEN MONEY PROVIDED TO CONSUMERS. TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO PURCHASE THE VEHICLES. THOSE ARE THE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN CRIMES CONTROL THEY'RE ALSO NUMBERS PROGRAMS ARE OUTSIDE OF CRIMES DIRECT CONTROL INCLUDING FEDERAL TAX INCENTIVES CONSUMER PREFERENCES. THE STATE PROGRAMS LIKE THE HIGH OCCUPANCY VEHICLE LANES- SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE OVERLAPPING THE COMPLICATION STARTS. OUR UNFORTUNATELY ARE REVIEWED ON A CAR DOES NOT DO ENOUGH TO COORDINATE ITS MEASUREMENT OVERLAPPING REGULATORY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS- THAT HAS TO DO WITH ON THE FRONT END IT DOESN'T DO ENOUGH IN THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION. ANOTHER AND THAT IS WHEN THEY DEVELOP A REGULATION PROGRAM THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY LOOKING FOR THE INFLUENCE OF THE OF THE- INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND VICE VERSA THEY'RE NOT ACCOUNTING FOR REGULATORY PROGRAMS THAT MIGHT REQUIRES THEMSELVES WHEN THEY PUT INTO PLACE SOMETHING LIKE CTRP OR RATHER WHEN THEY GO BACK TO THE TABLE AND DETERMINE WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE FINE CTRP MAKE ANY CHANGES TO IT. THAT ISSUE CARRIES ON THROUGH THE MEASUREMENT OF THESE PROGRAMS WE FOUND. THAT WHEN THE WAY THE CAR MEASURES COMPLIANCE WITH ITS REGULATORY PROGRAMS DOES NOT TRANSLATE EASILY HOW IT TALKS ABOUT ITS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. THAT IS THE COMPLIANCE WITH THIS REGULATORY PROGRAMS ARE NOT FOCUSED ON THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES NECESSARILY WHERE IS THAT IS HOW CAR TRACKS REPORTS ON THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM SO ALREADY. CARP HAS PUT ITSELF IN A POSITION WHERE IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ITS TWO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO TALK TO ONE ANOTHER IN TERMS OF THEIR OUT. AND THEN THERE'S A LARGE QUESTION RELATED TO CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AGAIN THE PURPOSE OF THESE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IS TO GET CONSUMERS TO DO THINGS THAT THEY WOULDN'T OTHERWISE DO BY MAKING IT MORE ATTRACTIVE PROPOSITION. HOWEVER WE FOUND THAT CAR GENERALLY CANNOT DEMONSTRATE THAT ITS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS TO THAT. ONE REASON THEY CANNOT IS THAT CRIME GENERALLY DOESN'T ACTUALLY ASK ITS PARTICIPANTS WHETHER OR NOT- THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM WAS WAS INSTRUMENTAL OR OR WAS THE DECIDING FACTOR IN THEIR DECISION TO PURCHASE. AND SO IF THAT'S NOT THE CASE THEN IT DIFFICULT FOR CARP TO ASSIGN CREDIT FOR THAT PURCHASE TO THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM- THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE AGAIN ALL THESE BENEFITS FLOW FROM THE INFLUENCE OF THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM ON A PURCHASE DECISION. AND KNOWING HOW EFFECTIVE THAT PROGRAM IS REQUIRES DISENTANGLING THAT BENEFIT FROM FROM SOMETHING LIKE THE REGULATIONS. IN THE CASE OF CRP WHICH IS THE ONE PROGRAM WE REVIEWED WHERE CAR ACTUALLY- MEASURES AND SURVEYS ITS PARTICIPANTS ABOUT WHAT MOTIVATED THEM TO PURCHASE THE VEHICLE. ABOUT HALF OF PEOPLE SLIGHTLY SLIGHTLY LESS THAN HALF PEOPLE SAY THEY WOULD HAVE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE EVEN WITHOUT THE CVR PETE REBATE. AND SO- WHAT WE WHAT WE NOTED HOWEVER IS THAT CARPET DONE VERY LITTLE IN THAT PROGRAM OR ANY OF ITS OTHER RELATIVES RELATED PROGRAMS TO DETERMINE. BASICALLY TO DETERMINE WHAT THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF THE PROGRAM'S EFFICACY AND TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM THAT WAITING YOU KNOW INCREASED IT'S THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MOTIVATING CONSUMERS TO DO YOU TAKE A STEP THEY WOULDN'T OTHERWISE DO YOU. REDUCE THE NUMBER OF WHAT WE CALL THE REPORT. THREE RIDERS- BUT- THE SO IN ORDER TO EXECUTE ARMIES TO BE COLLECTING MORE INFORMATION ON NOT JUST AS PARTICIPANTS BUT ALSO OTHER FACTORS THAT MIGHT DRIVE DECISIONS RELATED TO- CONSUMERS PURCHASES SUCH AS THESE EXTERNAL FACTORS LIGHT FEDERAL TAX CREDITS IS IN PREFERENCE IT'S BETTER AND SO I'M REALLY HAS A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN THAT AREA. AND THESE THESE HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR SHORT TERM REPORTING IT FOR LONG TERM REPORTING ABOUT GHG EMISSIONS ON THE SHORT END MISTER AUDITOR'S ALLUDED TO AT THE BEGINNING. THANK BY SHOULD AND VIA THAT PROGRAM PAYS FOR CHIU IT'S- EMISSIONS REPORTING TO A LEGISLATURE CARBON OVERSTATING. THE I. GHG EMISSIONS AND ITS PROGRAMS ACHIEVE. AN IN SHORT IS TAKING CREDIT FOR CPR BEFORE EVERY DEBATE YOU THE ARCHITECT IS OUT. WITHOUT TAKING ACCOUNT FOR THE INFLUENCE OF THINGS LIKE REGULATIONS REQUIRING SALE WITHOUT TAKING ACCOUNT FOR THINGS LIKE CONSUMER PREFERENCE THAT. WOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM TO PURCHASE THE VEHICLE EVEN WITHOUT CPR. THAT HAS A SHORT TERM OF ALSO OBSCURE. THE PROGRAM'S COST EFFECTIVENESS BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE TAKING CREDIT FOR LARGER AND LARGER AMOUNTS OF GHG REDUCTIONS THEM BACK SO WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR. BOB I MAKE THEM LOOK MORE COST EFFECTIVE OR EFFICIENT THAN THEY MIGHT IN REALITY. AND THESE HAVE LONGER TERM CONSEQUENCES IN TERMS OF CARDS. ARE USING THESE PROGRAMS YOU- GENERATE. BUT STILL SUSTAINABILITY IN THE AMONG THESE ARE THESE NEW TECHNOLOGY VEHICLES SO BRINGING USING INCENTIVES TO BRING HIM. ZYRTEC KNOWLEDGE YOUR SPRING CLEAN BUS TECHNOLOGY TO THE POINT WHERE INCENTIVES ARE NO LONGER NEEDED AND THEY CAN BE ON THE FAST TRACK TO ACHIEVING THOSE OBJECTIVES ABOUT THE PUTTING THOSE VEHICLES. OUT THERE ARE SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM IMPLICATIONS FOR PROGRAM DESIGN AND FOR REPORTING THE LEGISLATURE. THAT. STEM FROM THESE GAPS WERE IDENTIFIED. AS A RESULT WE MAKE US YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT AS BEEN SPENT STATED YOU KNOW FOCUS ON IMPROVED DATA COLLECTION% APPROVED DATA ANALYSIS SOME OF THOSE ARE AS SIMPLE AS COORDINATING THE METRICS BEING USED. OTHERS ARE RELATIVELY SIMPLE IN TERMS OF EXPANDING CARDS SURVEY ACTIVITIES AND ENSURING THAT IT'S COLLECTING INFORMATION FROM PARTICIPANTS WERE ALREADY YOU KNOW WILLING PARTICIPANTS RECEIVING A FINANCIAL BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM. AND THEN YOU KNOW USING THOSE IN THAT INFORMATION ABOUT BEHAVIOR ABOUT THE REGULATORY PROGRAMS IMPACT. ON AN INTERIM BASIS IMPROVE THE MEASUREMENT OF THE PROGRAM'S GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN REPORTS THE LEGISLATURE AND BECAUSE WE EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE TO POTENTIALLY BE AN ONGOING PROCESS. IT ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT CAR KEEP IT SUPPORT IN THE LEGISLATURE APPRAISE ITS PROGRESS WHERE IS IT ABLE TO IDENTIFY THIS INFORMATION IS HAVING PROBLEMS COLLECTING SOME INFORMATION. THAT WAY THE LEGISLATURE HAS MORE TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF THE TOOLS IT'S USING TO ALLOCATE THIS MONEY THIS MONEY EVERY YEAR AND CAN POTENTIAL YOU KNOW PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO OUR- GIFT CARD IS RUNNING UP AGAINST ADMINISTRATIVE OTHER HURDLES. IN PERFORMING IN PERFORMING- DISTANT ENHANCED MUCH. SO THE LAST AREA I'LL SPEAK ABOUT TODAY HAS TO DO WITH- THE SOCIAL ECONOMICAL ASSOCIATE WITH SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. AS BEEN STATED THERE ARE SOME BROAD GOALS THAT CAN PERTAIN TO THE ENTIRETY OF THE CAP AND TRADE'S FUNDED PROGRAMS IN THE STATE BUDGET PERTAIN TO THINGS LIKE JOB CREATION AND THE ON THE THIRD DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY AND LOW INCOME AND MIDDLE INCOME FROM ANY EXCUSE ME. SENDING REQUIREMENTS THAT- THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED- HOWEVER THERE ARE ALSO VERY SPECIFIC PROGRAM- GOALS THAT CARP HAS DEMONSTRATED OR HAS RATHER- CLEAN FOR ITS PROGRAMS THAT RELATE TO THINGS LIKE INCREASING PARTICIPANTS CREDIT SCORES THE STATE AUDITOR SUMMARIED IN HER REMARKS. BY ENABLING PARTICIPANTS TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE OF THEIR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE NOW THEY HAVE ACCESS TO A RIDESHARE PROGRAM ALLOW THEM TO GET TO DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS OR GROCERY. STORE THEY COULDN'T PREVIOUSLY ACCESS. EVEN CLAIMS A MAXIMIZE. YOU KNOW PROBABLY MAXIMIZING PARTICIPANTS ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE NOW THEY HAVE A MORE RELIABLE LESS EXPENSIVE SOURCE OF TRANSPORTATION. I CAN GET THEM TO TWO JOBS THEY CAN OTHERWISE WORKING GET THEM GET THEM THEY'RE RELIABLY. HOWEVER WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT CARD IS ACTUALLY MEASURING AND REPORTING IT REALLY IS JUST LIMITED TO THOSE LEGALLY REQUIRED DOLLAR SPENDING AND DISADVANTAGED LONG. MINUTES NORTHERN PARDON METRICS BUT THEY'RE AT THE PROBABLY THE HIGHEST LEVEL YOU KNOW THE BROADEST LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT CAR COULD POSSIBLY BE REPORTING IN SOME OF THESE AREAS. AND SO WHEN OUR TEAM WENT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING BETWEEN THIS GAP ABOUT THE BENEFITS THESE PROGRAMS ARE SUPPOSED TO CONFER. AND WHAT'S ACTUALLY COMING OUT OF CAR. WE FOUND THAT THERE ARE TWO BASIC REASONS WHY THIS IS A CURRENT. THE FIRST IS THAT CAR MIGHT NOT JUST. IT MIGHT NOT BE COLLECTING THE DATA IN NEEDS TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE INTENTION OF THE PROGRAM. THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE OF WHAT THE STATE HONOREE FOR TWO REGARDING THE LOAN REPAYMENT NUMBERS FOR ITS FINANCING SYSTEM PROGRAM. WE ASKED WHY CAR CAN'T MEASURE THE LOAN REPAYMENT IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY WERE TO BACK UP ITS CLAIMS ABOUT INCREASED CREDIT SCORES. HARPALUS WELL THEY DON'T THEY DON'T CONTROL THE LOANS THEMSELVES. SO AS A RESULT THEY DON'T KNOW WHETHER- PARTICIPANTS ARE ASKED TO BE PAYING OFF ONE. NO WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY ENCOURAGE CARPET DO WHATEVER IT COULD TO ACCESS THAT INFORMATION THROUGH ONE OF ITS THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATORS ARE YOU KNOW USING ITS AUTHORITY. OR LOOK FOR REMEDIES TO DO SO IN ANOTHER WAY WITH THE HELP OF THE LEGISLATURE WHAT HAVE YOU. THAT MINIMUM WE WOULD NOT EXPECT HARD TO DESIGN A PROGRAM AND MAKE CLAIMS ABOUT THAT PROGRAMS I THINK YOU SEE THAT CAN'T BACK UP. WITH THAT. ON THE OTHER HAND. THERE ARE SITUATIONS IN WHICH CARP HAPPIER LATELY HAS ACCESS TO IT YOU COULD BE USING TO MEASURE AND REPORT IS PROGRAMS BUT IT JUST HASN'T DONE SO. I EXAMPLE THERE HAS TO DO WITH ITS CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM- THAT PROGRAM- PAYS PAYS. FOLKS TO SCRAP OLD INEFFICIENT VEHICLES TO REPLACE THEM WITH WITH NEWER USED. VEHICLES INCLUDING SATURN HYBRID VEHICLES. AND PART OF THE ASSUMPTION THAT PROGRAM IS. NOW THIS INDIVIDUAL HAS A MORE RELIABLE SOURCE OF TRANSPORTATION NOW THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO GET TO JOBS AND JOB INTERVIEWS. WITH THIS YEAR FINANCIAL BENEFIT TO THEM. THAT'S THAT'S GOOD BEYOND THE SECOND OR THIRD ORDER BEYOND JUST PROVIDING. THEM YOU ACCESS TO A VEHICLE SO. HI RECOGNIZED WE KNOW TO BE NOTE BECAUSE NOT ONLY DOES IT MAKE THE CLAIM THAT THIS IS THE PROGRAM'S INTENT. BUT IT DESIGNED A FOURTEEN DIFFERENT OCCASIONS WHEN ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS WITH LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS. IT DESIGN SAMPLE SURVEY QUESTIONS THAT TRYING TO GET AT THESE VERY ISSUES. HOW MUCH HOW HOW HAS YOUR INCOME CHANGED SINCE YOU'VE GOTTEN YOUR VEHICLE HOW LIABLE AS YOUR NEW VEHICLE HOW MUCH DOES IT COST YOU TO MAINTAIN YOUR NEW VEHICLE IS THATMORE OR LESS THAN USED. RIGHT RUSSIANS ARE VERY PERTINENT TO BE BIG THE I YOU KNOW THE THEORY BEHIND THE PROGRAM'S SECOND THIRD LEVEL BENEFITS. HOWEVER WE WANT TO LOOK AT THAT SURVEY DATA WE FOUND CRIME ISN'T ACTUALLY COLLECTED. AND NO AND NO AND NOT ONLY DO THEY NOT COLLECTED BUT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY REQUIRE. THEIR DISTRICTS TO ASK THOSE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS SO KARMAZIN KNOW WHAT QUESTIONS THEY ARE DISTRICT IS ACTUALLY ASKING. THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME UNRELATED QUESTIONS IT'S A MIX OF QUESTIONS- SO. FAR MAY HAVE A TROVE OF VERY USEFUL DATA CENTER MAY HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S COMPLETELY UNUSABLE YOU KNOW SEVERAL YEARS. INTO THIS PROJECT. SO CAN TO CONNECT THE TENER DRESSED BE. THIS OF ISSUES BY. WE PUT TOGETHER WE THINK ARE PRETTY CALM. SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS OF MISTRUST IN THE LEFT SIDE. THOSE INCLUDE. ARE GOING THROUGH AND- DOESN'T. RICHARDS IT EXPECTS TO OPT. THESE THAT ARTICLE JUST GO BE GHG REDUCTIONS THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF TRANSPARENCY. TO ALLOW PARTICIPANTS AND THAT AND STAKEHOLDERS IN THE LEGISLATURE KNOW WHAT THE EXPECTATION FROM THESE PROGRAMS BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FROM ACCOUNTABILITY STANDPOINT BECAUSE THESE PROGRAMS. IT COSTS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE TO OPERATE. THE FINANCING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM COSTS ABOUT SEVEN TIMES AS MUCH TO REDUCE ONE TONNE OF GHGS SOMETHING LIKE. T. V. R. P. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THERE'S A LOT MORE INVESTMENT AND NOT JUST THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE. BUT ALSO THE TO THE PARTICIPANTS- YOU KNOW THERE'S HIGHLIGHTED LARGE STAFFING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH. WALKING PARTICIPANTS THROUGH THE LOAN PROCESS COACH YOU ABOUT FINANCIAL LITERACY BUT AS I'VE ALLUDED TO ALREADY THAT'S KIND OF WHERE THE INVESTMENT STOPS AND WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT WAS. A SIZEABLE DOLLAR INVESTMENTS ARE ACTUALLY PAYING OFF. LIKE OUR STUDENTS. OBVIOUSLY THE WE WOULD LIKE CALL TWO GO USE THAT THAT. AND MAKE SURE THAT MADE METRICS WITH USABLE DATA. THAT CAN THAT CAN BE USED TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND TO EXPORT ON. YOU KNOW WHETHER PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY WORKING AS A BASE TO MAKE YOU BASED ON THE LOGIC MODELS AND CREATIVE. AND FINALLY USE THAT INFORMATION TO RECOMMEND HAS ALREADY BEEN ALLUDED TO IN THIS DISCUSSION. THIS PROGRAM IS REALLY WORKING IT'S REALLY PAYING OFF IN TERMS OF THE SOCIOECONOMIC SIDE IT'S WORTH THE ADDED INVESTMENT VERSES. WE NEED TO TREAT THIS OTHER PROGRAM WE NEED TO WE NEED TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT THESE TYPES OF BENEFITS ARE ACTUALLY REASONABLE TO EXPECT MUCH TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. AND SO FORTH SO- ON BOTH ON THE GHGS INTERNET RECKONER SIDE. THE REAL END GOAL OF ALL OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO PROVIDE GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND GREATER TOOL FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND FOR CAR. USE TO PURSUE THE DIVERSE BUT IMPORTANT GOALS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS SET FORTH IN ITS AMBITIOUS. CARBON REDUCTION PLANS. AND SO WITH THAT I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO AND ALL THE QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- WITH THAT I KNOW THERE'S A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS WE'LL START WITH QUESTIONS HERE IN THE ROOM AND THEN WILL MOVE TO. REMOTE PARTICIPATION FOR THE MEMBERS THAT ARE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY THAT HAVE QUESTIONS. AND WITH THAT I GUESS I'LL GO AHEAD AND JUST KICK US OFF AND MAYBE I'LL JUST ASK SOMETHING THAT- THAT YOU GUYS BOTH TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AND I MISS HOW MENTIONED IT BUT THE TWENTY FIFTEEN CARP. GUIDELINES TO TRACK. THE BENEFITS THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT- WHAT WAS THE REASON WHY CARVE- DID NOT FOLLOW THESE GUIDELINES THAT WERE OUTLINED BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. YOU KNOW WHAT DID THEY SAY AS A REASON WHY THEY DIDN'T DO THIS. THEY PROVIDED US TWO REASONS MISTER SALAS ONE WAS. THE COMPLEXITY THE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING A WAY TO MEASURE JOB CREATION AS A FUNCTION OF THE INVESTMENT ITS PROGRAMS ARE MAKING HOWEVER WE KNOW WE'VE GOT THAT IN OUR TEXT BY SAYING WHAT THEY ULTIMATELY SETTLED ON WAS A FAIRLY STANDARD AND WIDELY USE INPUT OUTPUT- MODEL THAT HAS BEEN USED IN THIS AREA FOR A LONG TIME SO- WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE YOU KNOW THE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY WAS REALLY A LIMITING FACTOR IN THEIR ABILITY TO ROLL THIS OUT- THE OTHER ISSUE THAT THEY- WANTED TO. IS THESE GRANT AGREEMENTS I WOULD ADD TO THAT BUT THEY ENTER INTO WITH THE THIRD PARTIES THAT ADMINISTER A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS IN THE FIELD AND THEY HAD SAID WELL BASED ON THE TIMING OF SOME OF THESE AGREEMENTS WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO IN INSERT REQUIREMENTS INTO THESE AGREEMENTS THAT COMPEL THE ADMINISTRATORS TO REPORT THIS INFORMATION TO US. AND YOU KNOW WE POINTED OUT THAT YOU KNOW NOT ONLY HOW MANY OF THESE AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO POST. TWENTY FIFTEEN BUT THAT. I'M THE AGREED THE AGREED THAT WE WERE. CARP AS A MAN THOSE AGREE ON YOUR TO. FOR THINGS LIKE EXTENDING TIME EXTENDING DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND SO FORTH SO WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE CARP TO REVISIT THOSE ARRANGEMENTS WITH ITS ADMINISTRATORS SAY. HEY WE'D LIKE YOU TO THE PERFORMANCE RELATIVELY- YOU KNOW WILL COST A PIECE OF ANALYSIS FOR US SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE WE'RE FILLING OUR OBLIGATION. TO STATE LAW BUT ALSO TO OUR OWN FUNDING GUIDELINES- AND SO WE'RE YOU KNOW ANTICIPATING THAT QUICKLY CARVEL PURSUE BOTH OF THOSE REMEDIES YEAH. THANK YOU SO. TO THE FIRST POINT THE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY YOU'RE SAYING- YOU BELIEVE THEY CAN STILL PROVIDED THAT INFORMATION IN TO THE SECOND POINT- WHEN THEY AMENDED ALL THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTERED CONTRACTS THEY COULD ADD AN AMENDMENT IN THERE TO ACTUALLY BUILD IN THE DATA THAT WAS REQUIRED. UNDER LEGISLATION. CORRECT HELLO OKAY I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT ONE OF THE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT YOU GUYS TALKED ABOUT IN THE REPORT AB AND THAT'S THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM THE CVR P. PROGRAM WHICH YOU KNOW IS THE SME WAY PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO APPLY FOR REBATES IF THEY PURCHASED BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES HYDROGEN FUELED ELECTRIC VEHICLES OR PLUG IN HYBRID ELECTRIC LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES ARE ZERO EMISSION- MOTORCYCLES AND WHEN I LOOKED AT THE REPORTER WAS NEARLY ONE BILLION IN CAPITAL RATE FUND THAT HAVE BEEN SPENT ON THE PROGRAM. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT. WHAT PERCENTAGE WAS ACTUALLY SPENT AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. SURE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER OVER THE LIFE OF THE PROGRAM ONE ONE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THE PROGRAM ACTUALLY PREDATES THE REQUIREMENT IN STATE LAW SO IT PREDATES THE LEGISLATION THAT THAT PUT THOSE THAT CREATED THE AC I DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES- SO WHAT I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN RECENT YEARS- THOSE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY LOW COMPARED TO SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS CARVE OPERATES. I BELIEVE IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO FOR YOUR ACCOUNT YOUR TWENTY NINETEEN JUST THE MOST RECENT YEAR ON WHICH CAR WAS REPORTED THAT THE RP WAS AROUND TEN OR SPENDING WHEREAS SOME OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE THE- TRUCK AND BUS ABOUT YOUR PROGRAM WERE MUCH MUCH HIGHER AROUND FORTY OR EVEN UP TO FIFTY PERCENT- AND THEN I'D ALSO NOTE THAT IN PREVIOUS YEARS OUR CAR WAS WAS REPORTING. A LARGER POOL OF CTRP SPENDING IN THOSE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HOWEVER THAT WAS UNDER A PREVIOUS- VERSION OF THE LAW AND THE KINDS FROM CATTLE YEAH ALLOWED PARDON OTHER AGENCIES TO TAKE CREDIT FOR SPENDING THAT DIDN'T TAKE PLACE DIRECTLY INSIDE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BUT RATHER IN A IN A JOINING OR FINDING COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE IN THIRTY BENEFIT ENVIRONMENTALLY FROM FROM THE INVESTMENT ANYWAY. NOTABLY THE LEGISLATURE I AM TWENTY- TWENTY SIXTEEN CAME THROUGH AND SAID NO WE DEFINITELY WANT TO FOCUS THE SPENDING IN THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES THAT'S WE WANT TO SEE THE BENEFITS BUT NCPR PIECE CASE THAT THAT SEEMS TO HAVE COINCIDED WITH THAT A PRETTY MARKET REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF DOLLARS BEING SPENT INTO MANAGEMENT. CON THANK YOU AND I DON'T HAVE MY STAFF- PULL UP SOME OF THE NUMBERS AND I KNOW FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THE CV RP THE REBATE PROGRAM- MORE THAN 80% WHICH WAS THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WAS SPENT. OUTSIDE OF THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND SO I JUST WANTED TO ASK TO SEE IF YOU HAD LOOKED AT THAT SPECIFICALLY IF NOT THAT WE CAN MAKE. SURE WE'RE ASKING CARP WHEN THEY COME UP AFTER. AND I JUST I WOULD NOTE SIR THAT THAT THAT HE PERCENT AS I. OVER THERE DISTANT COMMUNITY SPENDING SO. THEY THEY CLAIM FORTY TWO MILLION JUST ABOUT WHEN USED. IN EIGHTY PER OF ACTIVE PLACE OUTSIDE. OF THE DISK MANAGEMENT AND SELF SO. IT'S A LITTLE EVEN MORE NOTABLE THAN THANK YOU HAVE GOT IT SOME OF THE FORTY TWO MILLION THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO SPEND IN A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY 80% OF THAT WAS SPENT OUTSIDE OF A DSADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. OF THAT POCKET OF MONEY. THAT'S WHAT I GOT IT. YES SIR. OKAY AND THEN YOU HAD MENTIONED- AND MISSILE ALSO TALKED ABOUT IT. BUT THE OVERLAP IN THE% PROGRAMS. AB DID THEY IS WAS THERE ANY METRIC THAT CARD PROVIDED TO ADJUST FOR THE OVERLAP IN THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU GUYS WERE WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE AUDIT REPORT. NO SO YOU KNOW WE LOOK AT EVERY PROGRAM WE WENT TO WE WENT THROUGH IN DETAIL THE REGULATORY- JUSTIFICATION DOCUMENTS AND THEN MANY OF THE FUNDING. THAT'S ON THE REGULATORY PROGRAM SIDE AND THEN. ON THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM SIDE ALL OF THE MATERIALS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FUNDING PLANS FOR CARP POSES FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM. LOOKING FOR ANY REALLY ANY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. OR ANY FORMAL KIND OF EIGHT AND NOW IT'S JUST OF THAT OVERLAP WHICH IS YOU KNOW VERY STARK IN MANY CASES AND DID NOT FIND IT- I WILL NOT AND THIS IS IMPORTANT I DON'T THE CONCLUSIONS YOU REACH AN ODD IT. IS THAT THE REASON CARP GAVE ON THE REGULATORY PROGRAM SIDE WAS. THAT IT WANTS TO DEVELOP STANDARDS REGULATIONS AND RULES THAT ARE ACHIEVABLE WITHOUT THE HELP OF INCENTIVE PROGRAM- BECAUSE IT DOESN'T KNOW WHETHER INCENTIVE POGRAMS LIKE CBRC WILL EXIST IN PERPETUITY. OR WHETHER THERE'LL BE ENOUGH MONEY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE INDUSTRY THAT'S BEING AFFECTED. AND SO WE YOU KNOW WE KIND OF GAVE CARD BENEFIT DOWN SO THAT'S A REASONABLE APPROACH WHAT THAT WHAT THAT MEANS ALMOST BY DEFINITION IS THAT. THE INCENTIVE DOLLARS SHOULD BE CREATING REDUCTIONS ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT YOU REGULATIONS WHICH YOU ALONE AND THAT'S WHERE WE REALLY EXPECTED TO SEE AN ANALYSIS FROM CLARK ABOUT. OKAY WE HAVE C. B. R. P. WE KNOW WE HAVE IS THAT REGULATION THAT'S SUPPOSED TO STAND ON ITS OWN IN TERMS OF ITS EFFECTIVENESS. WHAT ELSE THE C. B. R. P. BRING TO THE TABLE IN TERMS OF VEHICLE SO. AND THERE IS SOME INDICATION IN STATEWIDE DATA THAT- IS THERE ARE BEING THERE ARE MORE IS THAT IS BEING SOLD IN THE REGULATIONS CURRENTLY REQUIRE. A CAR HASN'T DONE ANY ANY FORMAL EFFORT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THAT'S THE RESULT OF CVR PETE WHETHER THAT'S THE RESULT OF. THE CONSUMER PREFERENCE WHETHER THAT'S THE RESULT OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS ETCETERA SO THERE STILL ARE PRETTY MUCH IN THE DARK ABOUT THE MARGINAL BENEFIT AT THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO BRING TO THE TABLE. CALLACHAN NOT OVERLAP DO YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO RECREATE A POLICY. THAT ENSURES CLEAR OUTCOMES FOR THOSE. WE DON'T HAVE A LEGISLATE RECORD. I DIRECTOR AT THIS. WE TRIED TO BE- WE TRY TO GET AWAY BEING OVER THE- ABOUT THE PROCESS THAT CARD SHOULD- SHOULD. SHIP APPROACH THAT'S WHERE ANOTHER WE WORK. VERY PRESCRIPTIVE ABOUT THE TYPES OF CONSIDERATIONS SHOULD MAKE. PART OF THAT IS YOU KNOW THEY'RE THESE THIS ISSUE MAY OR- MAY OR MAY NOT APPLY IN A MEAT PIE MORE OR LESS GIVEN TO SPECIFIC PROGRAM GIVEN THE SPECIFIC VEHICLE. WE INTENTIONALLY LOOK AT PROGRAMS THAT WE THOUGHT HAD A HIGH RISK OF OVERLAP OR POSSIBLE. DUPLICATION OR REDUNDANCY- AND IN ANOTHER ISSUE ANOTHER REASON RATHER IS THAT CAR MADE YOU KNOW HAS SIGNIFICANT WORK TO DO TO THINK ABOUT. HOW THESE PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED. IN ORDER TO STIMULATE THE GREATEST ACTIVITY ON THE BACK END BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE METRICS THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR. THAT SAID- YOU KNOW IF THERE IF THERE IS A ROLE FOR LEGISLATIVE. OVERSIGHT OR OR- EVER KIND OF BELIEVE THAT CAR IS DOING THAT. NO WE CAN CERTAINLY. KEEP PROVIDING. SURGICAL SYSTEMS THAT YOU MIGHT NEED. THANK YOU I HAVE A QUESTIONS REMAIN A DEFERRED OF COLLEAGUE IN THE ROOM- FOR THEIR QUOTE. OF I DO WAY TO ASK. MEMBERS KNOW THAT ARE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY IF YOU WANT TO GET ON THE LISTS TO ASK A QUESTION. I BELIEVE THE QUICKEST AND MOST EFFICIENT WAY IS TO JUST TEXT. ME AND I THINK MY NUMBER WAS PROVIDED TO EACH OF THE MEMBERS- TEXT ME AND I'LL GET YOU AND Q. FOR A LINE OF QUESTIONING SO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE. TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN THAN TO SENATOR GONZALEZ SENT TO SENATOR DOLLY. THANKS AT FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE AUDITOR AND THANK SENATOR BRADFORD FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IT'S CRUCIAL. THAT WE HAVE GOOD QUANTITATIVE DATA TO UNDERSTAND THESE PROGRAMS THAT IMPROVE THE MOVING FORWARD I THINK THAT SHOULD BE EVERYBODY'S GOAL. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE FROM. THE AUDITOR HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THE DEFICIENCIES IN THE REPORTS. I JUST HAVE A FEW QUICK QUESTIONS- FIRST OF ALL. ANOTHER STATEMENT I. DO THINK THAT WHEN IT COMES TO. I'M LOOKING AT THE ISSUE WITH DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THE SORT OF UNDER UTILIZATION OF. THE INCENTIVES I THINK T'S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE USE DATA TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE PROBABLY THAT THERE. VERY WELL MIGHT BE BARRIERS. BEYOND THE INCENTIVE THAT PREVENT THOSE COMMUNITIES FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE. OF THE PROGRAM- THE INABILITY TO INSURE A CAR IN ABILITY TO STORE CAR CHARGER CARD IS A LOT OF THINGS BEYOND THE PROGRAM ITSELF. SOME OF WHICH COULD BE VERY WELL OUT OF CARDS CONTROL AND I REALLY LIKE THE COMMON FROM THE AUDITOR. ABOUT LOOKING AT MOBILITY AND EQUITY- YEAH AND SERVING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF. HAVING AN EYE TOWARDS NOT JUST SAYING WE WANT EVERYBODY IN THESE COMPANIES TO. PURCHASE A VEHICLE OR BE ABLE TO BUT TO SAY WE WANT EVERYBODY IN THESE COMMUNITIES TO HAVE VERY GOOD CONVENIENT MOBILITY OPTIONS. THAT ARE- PROVIDE THEM BETTER MOBILITY MODE TO MOBILITY NEEDS TO BE THE GOAL NOT ANY PARTICULAR TYPE OF VEHICLE- SO. MY QUESTION IS IF AND WHEN MORE COMMON IN THE MY QUESTION EITHER CALL COMMENT IS THAT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAD HIGHLIGHTED AS POTENTIAL QUESTIONS TO ASK PEOPLE IN THESE COMMUNITIES ABOUT. THEIR FINANCIAL STATUS BEFORE HAVING A CAR AND AFTER INCOME. I DO THINK COULD BE SEEN BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE CAN OF THAT COMMUNITIES BEING VERY INTRUSIVE QUESTIONS SO I THINK THAT IT'S NOT THAT EASY. TO GET PARTICIPATION WITH THAT KIND OF LINE OF QUESTIONING FOR ANYBODY THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY INVASIVE QUESTIONS. SO MY QUESTION IS. THAT I WONDER WHETHER. THAT THAT A LOT OF THESE IMPACTS ARE ONLY BE ON CARBS. KIND OF JURISDICTION UP BEYOND THEIR ABILITY TO REALLY ASCERTAIN. AND I'M WONDERING IF THE AUDITOR HAS ANY SUGGESTIONS OF WHO REALLY SHOULD BE DOING THIS pLOOKING AT THIS BECAUSE I SAYS LISTENING TO I WONDER WHETHER CARP IS THE CORRECT. BODY TO DO SO EVALUATION OF THOSE KINDS OF IMPACTS SO THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION. CERTAINLY SO. I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT'S OUR INTENTION TO RULE OUT THE ASSISTANCE FOR THE PARTICIPATION OF ANY OTHER ENTITY AND AS WE AS WE INCLUDE IN OUR REPORT CARD IS UNDER CONTRACT WITH YOU SEE AND OTHER ENTITIES AND- I WITH THE- THE AIM OF. OF A ATTEMPTING TO HAVE IMPROVED SO MUCH DATA COLLECTION- BUT I THINK WHAT WE KEEP COMING BACK SO WE KEPT COMING BACK TO IN OUR ANALYSIS WAS IN. UNDERSTANDING THE BARRIERS THAT THAT YOU THAT YOU RAISED ABOUT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS ARE ACCESSING THESE. THOSE QUITE YOU KNOW THE QUESTIONS YOU'RE REFERENCING ARE ARE ARE CARDS ONLY DESIGNED SO. IT APPEARS THAT THERE'S AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT CARL WHEN THEY DESIGNED THESE PROGRAMS AND THAT THEY CREATE A LOGIC MODEL THAT SHOULD BE MEASURABLE- THAT THEY EXPECT TO HAPPEN- WE JUST HAVEN'T SEEN. THE LEVEL OF EFFORT ON THE BACK AND SO YOU KNOW IF WE HAD MORE OF THAT EFFORT TRIAL AND ERROR TO ASSESS AND WE KNEW MORE ABOUT WHAT- IN ACTUALITY WHAT THE BEARS HAVE BEEN TO CARD DATA COLLECTION IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR US TO SPEAK TO. WHO THE RIGHT PERSON IS IF IT'S NOT CAR BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT KIND OF A- A REALITY WE WERE ABLE TO EVALUATE. SO YOU DON'T HAVE ANY ANY IDEAS OF KIND OF WHAT THE RIGHT. WHO WHAT THEIR IDENTITY WOULD BE SAID TO DO THIS KIND OF ANALYSIS OR EVEN TO THE DATA COLLECTION BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S- DONE TO MY- CAR. TO ME. WELL IT'S NOT JUST CAR. CAR PARTY. CAR PAYS- ERR DISTRICTS AND ALL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO ADMINISTER. THESE PROGRAMS TO INTERFACE WITH PARTICIPANTS TO HANDLE. ALL OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS SEES. AND SO ON THEY MAY NOT BE CARVE ON THE GROUND ASKING THESE QUESTIONS. BUT THAT WOULD BE YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND OF A NATURAL. YOU KNOW INROAD INTO- YOU KNOW WORKING WITH PARTICIPANTS REMAINING BE. COLLECTING DATA WHATEVER IT MAY BE RELEVANT TO THE PROGRAM BUT WHAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IS APPROPRIATE KIND OF FORESIGHT IN OVERSIGHT I'M CARP TO ENSURE THAT IS POSITIONING ITSELF. TO REQUIRE THAT DATA COLLECTION TO HELP ITS PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS KNOW WHAT TO COLLECT AND CERTAINLY TO REVIVE IT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S BEING COLLECTED SO AGAIN I WOULD I KIND OF JUST. LIKE A BETTER PHRASE DEFERRED TO THE FACT THAT- THERE DO SEEM TO BE A RESOURCES IN PLAY AND WITHOUT HAVING SEEN- EVIDENCE OF IT BEING UNSUCCESSFUL IN THE NEXT LEVEL OF EFFORT IT'S HARD FOR US TO SPECULATE ABOUT WOULD BE A MORE. A RESOURCE OKAY I ASK BECAUSE YOU KNOW I DO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE BETTER DATA AND WE HAVE THE DATA AS WE EVALUATE- THESE PROGRAMS. AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION FOR NOW IS- WHAT IS YOUR OFFICE AND BUSINESS THE IDEAL OUTCOME FROM THIS AUDIT. IS IT TO HAVE CARBS SPEND MORE TIME ON PROGRAMMATIC YOU KNOW QUALIFICATIONS AND- VALUATIONS OR IS IT TO ELIMINATE THE PROGRAM SAID AREN'T REALLY DIRECTLY. REDUCING EMISSIONS. I IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A GOOD. POINT OF THE AUDIT IS AT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE PROGRAMS INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER RIGHT. BECAUSE NO ONE PROGRAM IS GOING TO KIND OF BE THE SILVER BULLET YOU'RE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT POLICY. CAN THIS ONLY BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE QUANTIFICATION OF THE IMPACTS OF THE PROGRAM OR IS IT. JUST AS IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE SORT OF A BETTER NARRATIVE OF HOW ALL THESE PROGRAMS WORK TOGETHER AND THE REGULATORY SIDE WORK TOGETHER. THANK YOU. I THINK THE NARRATIVE. THE NARRATIVE IS RELATIVELY IN PLACE IN SOME CASE RIGHT THAT THE LOGIC MODELS DO YOU KNOW THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE NOT UNREASONABLE AND OF PROGRAM BY PROGRAM BASIS IT'S NOT- I DON'T WE DIDN'T APPROACH THIS WITH THE ANY SORT OF PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW WHETHER WHETHER IT DOES OR DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO ON THE ONE HAND COMPELS CERTAIN TYPES OF PRODUCTION AND SALE ON THE OTHER HAND REALLY TRY TO HELP PEOPLE. BRING CALIFORNIA PASSED WHAT REGULATIONS CAN REALISTICALLY ACHIEVE ON THEIR OWN I DO THINK AT THIS POINT REALLY DOES COME DOWN TO BEING INTENTIONAL ABOUT LEARNING FROM WHAT FOR MEASURING WHAT PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO ACHIEVE IN THESE DIFFERENT WAYS AND WE ARE DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES. AND BEING INTENTIONAL ABOUT WHETHER THOSE PROGRAMS ARE ADDING THE MAGNITUDE OF BENEFITS THAT THAT THE STATE WOULD EXPECT AND FUNDAMENTALLY IN TERMS OF OUR PRODUCTS WE WOULD HOPE THAT THAT IS INFORMATION. FOR THE LEGISLATURE THAT JOINS. EVERYWHERE DATA ABOUT. YOU KNOW THESE OF INCENTIVE PROGRAMS PROVIDE THESE TYPES OF BENEFITS RELIABLY MAYBE THESE DO NOT AS MUCH WE SHOULD WE SHOULD INVEST MORE IN PROGRAMS ACCESS AND CONSIDER REVISIONS TO PROGRAM WHY I THINK THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IS THAT THE SAME SORT OF LIMITATION EDELWEISS MEASUREMENT WISE REPORTING WHY. ARE KIND OF PRESENCE ACROSS THE ENTIRE RANGE OF INCENTIVE PROGRAMS BE REVIEWED AND SO THE LEGISLATURE IS AS IT IS FORCED TO TAKE AT FACE VALUE THE YOU KNOW THE RELATIVE EFFICACY OF THOSE PROGRAMS WHEN IN FACT THOSE DON'T ACTUALLY THOSE MEASUREMENTS DON'T ACTUALLY TELL THE STORY ABOUT HOW THE PUSH AND PULL WITH REGULATIONS OR THE- THE INFLUENCE FROM OUTSIDE OF CARDS CONTROL WHETHER IT BE FROM OTHER STATE PROGRAMS OR FEDERAL PROGRAMS. SO IT DON'T START A SAYS IT IS TO CLARIFY IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU'RE SAYING THAT REALLY THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THE AUDIT IN THE END OF THE DAY IS FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THAT BIGGER PICTURE OF HOW THESE PROGRAMS. INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER. RIGHT SO IT'S NOT REALLY TIED TO SAY THAT ANYONE PROGRAMS NOT WORKING IT'S- IT IS TO DEVELOP THAT DATA SET THAT GIVES US THAT THAT HOLISTIC PICTURE. WE WOULD HOPE THAT THAT DATA SAID WOULD TASK THE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOW THESE PROGRAMS FIT TOGETHER. AND GIVE THE IN THE LEGISLATURE INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE GETTING BANG FOR THEIR BUCK WHERE THEY'RE GETTING RETURN ON INVESTMENT. SO THE LISTENER CAN MAKE INFORMED AND RELIABLE DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE TO PUT OUR RESOURCES IN THE PURSUIT OF THE CALLS SO YES. UNDERSTANDING ROGAN'S WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO ACCOMPLISH IS A KEY STEP. BUT YOU KNOW THAT IN AND OF ITSELF IS NOT GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE. YOU KNOW CLEAN BASS MAKES RELIABLE INVESTMENTS NOW IT MIGHT ONLY BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW US TO GET TO TWENTY THIRTY AND THEN LOOK BACKWARDS AND SAY. YOU KNOW WE'RE OUR ASSUMPTIONS CORRECT YES OR NO. THAT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S A SUFFICIENT PLACE FOR THE STATE TO KIND OF. WAIT AROUND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIMPLY WOMAN FRIEDMAN- SOUNDS LIKE THREE WITH MORE DATA YOU HAVE YOU CAN DETERMINE. THE MOST BANG FOR THE BUCK IS KIND WITH THEIR- TALKED ABOUT WITH THE WILL OF THE CENTRE GONZALEZ AND THEN WILL MOVE TO- SON. SENATOR DOLLY THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER THAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG AND SENATOR MCCASKEY. YES THANK YOU- THANK YOU CHAIR SALASAND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS- PANEL. MOST OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I ASK ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN ANSWERED BUT- I JUST WANT TO DRILL DOWN ON ON ONE PARTICULAR PROGRAM THAT YOU'D MENTIONED WHICH IS THE LOAN REPAYMENT INCREASE CREDIT SCORES GOAL- AND I GUESS THE- DISCUSSION THERE WAS THAT THEY- DON'T. FROM CARBS PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THEY DON'T CONTROL THE LOANS BUT CAN YOU GIVE US MORE. ON WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS COULD BE PUT FORWARD IN ADDITION TO JUST STATING FLATLY THAT THEY CAN'T CONTROL THE LOANS I MEAN WHAT. I MEAN THIS I THINK IS A BIG FACTOR IN. OBVIOUSLY THIS THIS PROGRAM AS WELL. IT DEFINITELY SO YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY POSSIBLY MINUS REMARKS KIND OF SHOWED UP YOU WEREN'T FULLY CONVINCED BY THAT YOU KNOW LACK OF OWNING A LOAN AS A AS A TRUE LIMITING FACTOR AND- YOU KNOW UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL YOU KNOW. INVASIVENESS OF QUESTIONS YOU KNOW WE ARE ENCOURAGED HARD TO DO WHAT I CAN TO WORK WITH THIS PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS TO SAY. YOU KNOW ARE YOU A SUCCESSFULLY REPAYING YOUR LOAN I MEAN THE CARB CARB ALTERNATIVE WE IDENTIFIED THE FREQUENCY- REPOSSESSIONS OF VEHICLES IS ANOTHER POTENTIAL- TOOL THEY COULD USE BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THEY'VE LOOKED AT FORMALLY WHEN WE RAISE THAT WITH THAT MAKE IT KIND OF WENT AND LOOKED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED AND- AND SO IT'S A SMALL SMALL PROGRAM THUS FAR SO WE HAVEN'T REALLY. UTILIZE THIS DATA TO TRY AND EXTRAPOLATE ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVE THE PROGRAM IS. A HUNDRED AND THAT WAS WELL IT IT'S A HIGHLY PROGRAM SO IT'S KIND OF RELATIVELY SMALL BY ITS NATURE AND WHAT BETTER TIME TO BE USING TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PROGRAM'S RELATIVE. SIZE TO BE CREATIVE ABOUT. HOW GOING TO CALL THE GAP. WHITE WHERE YOU ARE NOW AND WHAT YOU THINK THE PROGRAM IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE TO ITS PARTICIPANTS IN TERMS. IT'S PAST SUPPORT SO. WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO USING A REASONABLE STANDING OR PROXY FOR. CREDIT SCORES BUT CAR IS KIND OF WELL SHORT OF THAT. AND I MEAN THE LAST THING I'LL SAY ABOUT THIS PROGRAM SINCE YOU'VE EXPRESSED INTEREST IS. ALREADY OVER THE PROGRAM DATA THAT CAR DOES COLLECT. THE SUGGEST THAT THERE'S PRETTY WIDE VARIATION IN THE LOAN INTEREST RATES THAT THE PROGRAM IS INVOLVED. SO YOU DON'T MISS ANY LOANS ACHIEVED THROUGH THE PROGRAM DIRECTLY BUT WE SAW ALONE DESPITE YOU KNOW UPWARDS OF25% ON SOME OF THESE OTHER VEHICLE. DITIONS AND SO I GUESS I'M- TRY TO DIVORCE FROM WHAT'S DIRECTLY INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF CARDS CONTROL WE DO FEEL LIKE IT'S IN OUR CONTROL IS TO BE. VERY PROACTIVE AND RESPONSIVE TO WHAT THEY'RE SEEING IN THAT THERE THE SITE IS THAT ALONE THAT WE WANT TO ASSOCIATE WITH OUR PROGRAM IS THAT A LOAN THAT PROVIDES. THE PARTICIPATE WITH THAT TYPE OF OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE AND IF NOT THEN WE NEED TO SEE INTERVENTIONS AND WE NEED TO SEE THEM. AT THE PILOT PROGRAM STAGE BEFORE THERE IS A DECISION MADE TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM LARGER OR ALTERNATELY NOT TO PURSUE IT SO I HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. YES YOU DID AND I JUST WANNA SAY THANK AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED TO THE POINT I GUESS I'M TRYING TO MAKE AS WELL AS THAT YOU KNOW. THERE'S SO MANY OTHER ISSUES THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED BECAUSE OF LACK OF OVERSIGHT WHICH IS THESE HIGH INTEREST RATES WHICH PUTS PEOPLE DEEPER IN. DEBT AND THAT- A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT SITUATION THAN THEY NEED TO BE- SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND SO I'LL LEAVE IT THERE BUT WELL I WHAT I WILL SAY IS I'M JUST SORT OF. TAKEN ABACK BY THE LACK OF DATA COLLECTION THIS LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM THAT SHOULD BENEFIT PEOPLE AND THEN THE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR TRENDS SHOULD BE A GOAL AS YOU MENTIONED. I NEED THAT DATA TO BE ABLE TO ASSUME- THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS WORKING OR NOT AND BE ABLE TO ADJUST POLICIES FROM THERE ON SO THANK. YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR ANSWERING THAT QUESTION. I YOU SENATOR BECAUSE- I KNOW SENATOR BRAD- HOW A LOT OF CONCERN WHEN WE- INITIALLY TALKED TO BE ABOUT THE AUDIT ABOUT THE SOCIAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS- THAT CARBS CLAIMING SO THINK PRESS. ASKING THAT QUESTION ON BEHALF OF SENATOR BRADFORD AS WELL. I WAS MOVED TO SENATOR DOLLY POLICE. I THINK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I. WANTED TO- JUST FIRST OFF THANK GOD- SENATOR LAYERED FOR HIS OPENING COMMENTS IT'S BEEN TWELVE YEARS SINCE TWO THOUSAND. AND EIGHT WHEN WE WHEN THEY PASSED AB THIRTY TWO AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A BEER THE ONLY MEMBER SITTING THAT ACTUALLY WAS HERE THAN THAT WHEN I HAPPEN I'M NOT SURE- BUT IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT- SO AND SINCE THEN WE HAVE WE HAVE SEVEN AS OF OCTOBER LAST YEAR. THERE WERE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA. AT THE AUTHORS REPORT NOTED ALL THE STATE'S ZAB GOALS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED THROUGH EXECUTIVE ORDER FIRST GOVERNOR BROWN WITH ONE POINT FIVE MILLION BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND THEN FIVE MILLION BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND THE GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S EXECUTIVE ORDER DIRECTED THEY ARE BE TO ACHIEVE A HUNDRED PRESENTS HAVE CELLS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. WHICH IS FOURTEEN YEARS FROM NOW SO AT THE RATE WE WENT IN THE PAST AND THE RATE WE'RE GOING. MY QUESTION IS NUMBER ONE WHAT. WHAT STATUTORY AUTHORITY WILL BE RELIED ON TO ADOPT REGULATION TO BAN THE SALES OF INTERNAL BUSTIN CAN ENGINE BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AS DIRECTED BY THE GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. SO I GUESS I CAN SAY THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER WASN'T WASN'T A PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE AUDIT HOWEVER I'M I'M DEFERRED. ON THE F. LEGAL COUNSEL HERE I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN SPEAK TO OR NOT IT WASN'T- ADDRESS FOCUSED. THAT WASN'T A DIRECT FOCUS OF OUR OUTAGE. BUT IN SO FAR AS WHAT KIND OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY THE LEGISLATURE CAN PASS WHAT IT WANTS TO AS LONG AS IT'S NOT IN CONFLICT WITH FEDERAL LAW.I MIGHT THAT'S MY POINT IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HASN'T PASSED THESE HAVE BEEN DONE BY EXECUTIVE ORDER SO THAT WAS MY QUESTION ACTUALLY. AND SENATOR IT MIGHT BE- PRUDENT UPON US WILL ASK CARP THAT QUESTION WHEN THEY WHEN THEY COME UP SINCE WILL BE THE IMPLEMENTING BODY. OKAY THAT'S MY ONLY QUESTION FOR RIGHT NOW THAN. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR WITH THAT WILL MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THIS IS KIND OF REMINISCENT OF. MY ROLE AS THE CHAIR OF TRANSPORTATION THE FOR ALMOST SIX YEARS AND- BEFORE THAT THE CHAIR OF ACCOUNTABILITY MINISTRY TO REVIEW WHICH I HAD MY FIRST CAR APPEARING IN THE DISTRICT. EIGHT YEARS AGO AND- HE MIGHT BECAME THE CHAIR OF TRANSPORTATION WE WERE MADE AWARE OF THE FIFTY PLUS TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS THAT WERE ADMINISTERED BY CARBON- AND- WE DID HAVE HEARINGS TO ASCERTAIN. WHAT THEIR METRICS OF PERFORMANCE PLUS. AND AFTER HAVING TO HAVE I BELIEVE IT WAS THREE SUBSEQUENT HEARINGS TO GET THE INFORMATION. THE SAME KIND OF RESULTS JUST CAME OUT OF THIS AUDIT IT'S LIKE DEJA VU. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE ASKED THEM IN THE HOUSE YOU KNOW WHAT WAS THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROGRAM. DID YOU ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM HOW MUCH DOES IT COST. AND WHAT WAS THE- METRIC TONNAGE THAT WAS REDUCED. NOBODY HAD ANY KIND OF DATA WHATSOEVER TO TELL US. WE WOULD HAVE HOUGHT THAT THROUGH THAT PROCESS WITH THE TRANSPORTATION. COMMITTEE THAT THAT WOULD HAVE EVOLVED. BUT IT SEEMS TO COME FORWARD THAT. THERE'S THIS KIND OF VIEWPOINT THAT HAVE WILL JUST COME TO YOU AND WE'LL DO WHAT WE WANTED TO. AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT. THE MONIES THAT HAVE BEEN SPENT SINCE. CAP AND TRADE IS BEEN INVOLVED. 25% OF CAP AND TRADE GOES TO HIGH SPEED RAIL. ANOTHER 25% OF CAP AND TRADE GOES TO TRANSIT. WE HAVE GONE THROUGH A HUGE RECESSION FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND RECOVERED LATE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND AN ARMED WE JUST HAD A HUGE PANDEMIC. BUT THERE WAS NEVER ANY RELIEF FOR GOALS OR ANYTHING THROUGH INDUSTRY SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN PEOPLE FOR REGULATION TO COMPLY. THERE WAS NO COMPASSION WHATSOEVER IT WAS ONLY ONE GOAL. AND YOU HAD TO COMPLY NO MATTER WHAT. I'VE SEEN BUSINESSES COMPLETELY DEVASTATED BECAUSE OF THE TRUCK AND BUS ROLL. PEOPLE LATER ON IN LIFE THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO RE INVEST. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN EQUIPMENT SO THEY CAN FINISH OUT THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS OF THEIR- YOU KNOW WORKING LIFE- I AM SO HAPPY THAT WE WERE FINALLY I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST AUDIT OF THIS AGENCY. L. I AM HAPPY AND I CAN'T THINK THE STATE AUDITOR AT A NOT FOR MAKING THIS. EFFORT WHO IS ALSO A FANTASTIC UMPIRE. THROUGH THE JOINT BASEBALL SOFTBALL UP BUT- MISTER CHAIR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS WAS CLEARLY OUTLINED IN THE TRANSPORTATION HEARINGS IS THIS EXACT EXAMPLE WHAT WAS CLEARLY BROUGHT FORWARD IN THE A LOT OF. WE HAVE THE ROLE AS A AS A BODY TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT FOR THE MONEY THAT IS SPENT. WHEN YOU LOOK SENSE CAP AND TRADE DISPENSED INSTALLED IN TWELVE TWENTY THIRTEEN I THINK INVESTMENT WAS STARTING TO BE MADE. TWELVE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS HAVE BEEN INVESTED TO REDUCE I THINK APPROXIMATELY FORTY FIVE MILLION METRIC TONS OF. CARBON WHICH IS VERY VERY BOTTOM PLATES VERY. I AM VERY PROUD OF THAT. BUT IN THEIR SCOPING PLAN THEY DON'T IDENTIFY NATURAL CARBON EMISSIONS. AND SO THAT FORTY FIVE MILLION METRIC TONS AND TWELVE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS SPENT. WITH NEGATED BY THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA WANT TO TALK ABOUT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. EVERYTHING IN CALIFORNIA WAS A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY WITH ALL THAT SMOKE. SIXTY EIGHT MILLION METRIC TONS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- NEGATING SEVEN YEARS OF INVESTMENT. SEVEN YEARS WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE BIGGEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK AND INVESTMENT TAILPIPE EMISSIONS ARE IMPORTANT BUT IF YOU KEEP THROWING BAD MONEY AFTER GOOD. AND THEN WE HAVE THESE NATURAL OCCURRING WILDFIRES IN SANTA CRUZ AND ALL OF THESE AREAS ARE DEVASTATED. WE ARE NOT MAKING ANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS WHAT SO EVER. TAKE TWO STEPS FOUR AND FIVE PACK. TWO HUNDRED MILLION METRIC TONS OF BEEN ADMITTED AND THREE YEARS OF WILDFIRES. WE NEED TO RETIRE PRIORITIZE TO BE ABLE TO CATCH UP ON THE LARGEST CARBON EMITTER. AND BE ABLE TO COME BACK. AND SAY OKAY WE'VE GOT A HANDLE ON THIS NOW. WELL WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORK TOWARDS THAT. MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE YOUR LETTING ME SPEAK MY PIECE THANK YOU SEVEN MEMBER FRAZIER I THINK YOU JUST HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE FRUSTRATIONS OF MEMBERS HAVE I KNOW YOU SAID YOU HAD A NUMBER OF HEARINGS. ON CARBON STILL SAYING THE LACK OF DATA I THINK IS WHAT THE AUDIT REPORT IS. KIND OF ALLUDED TO SO THAT WE CAN MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS- WITH THAT WILL MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I WANT. BUILD OFF OF- SOME QUESTIONS THAT- THE ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION CHAIR MENTIONED ABOUT WHETHER. CAR BIZ RIGHT ENTITY- TO EVALUATE ITS PROGRAMS AND I'VE HEARD FROM I GUESS IT READING THAT THE AUDIT REPORT THERE IS SOME PROGRAMS THAT THAT I IDENTIFIED THAT INDICATE THAT CAR CAN COLLECT THE DATA AND IT DOESN'T. AND THEN THERE ARE SOME PROGRAMS THAT STATE THAT INDICATE THAT CAR DOESN'T HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO COLLECT THE DATA RIGHT NOW I'M INTO IT KIND OF COVERS THAT SPECTRUM- SO I GUESS AND FROM MY UNDERSTANDING AND OF COURSE WHAT ON. WHAT THE TRANSPORTATION CHAIR FROM THE SENATE HAS SAID IS THAT WE KNOW WE'RE EVALUATING IN THE BUDGET YOU KNOW BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT ARE GOING TO BE GOING TO HE'S PROGRAMS BUT WE CAN'T AS A LEGISLATURE EVALUATE WHETHER THINGS ARE WORKING OR NOT. AND YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE GOT. PROGRAMS THAT CARVER SAYING WORKS BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE TO BACK IT UP AND THEN THERE. BOB GRAHAM'S THAT DON'T HAVE ANY DATA WHATSOEVER SO. HOW DO I JUST SUPPOSE THAT REALITY WITH THE TIMELINESS OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS RIGHT NOW. SO AND SO HOW DO I HOW DO I EVALUATE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE. YOU ASKING FOR AN ANNUAL REPORT. BUT WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS NOW. I CERTAINLY. HAS WITH THE WITH THE CHALLENGE THERE AND I CAN ONLY SAY IN TERMS OF THE TIMING OF OUR REPORT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THOSE ARE ARE IN PART A FUNCTION. WHAT KIND OF THE LACK OF A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR MANY OF THE PROGRAMS- I JUST WANT TO BACK UP SLIGHTLY TO CLARIFY THAT I THINK. YOU KNOW THERE IS A SPECTRUM OF LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY POTENTIAL LEVEL OF EFFORT TO SOME OF THIS DATA BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE IDENTIFIED REPORTED ON MANY THAT ARE SQUARELY WITHIN THE CAR CANNOT ACCESS. THAT ARE HAS NO WAY OF THE- HEATING OR- IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN- CARB IS NOT DEMONSTRATED THE EFFORT FROM OFFER TO DO SO. SO THAT THAT LACK OF DATA COLLECTION- THAT LACK OF A PROGRAM AND YOU KNOW DESIGN OR SYSTEMS BUILT INTO PLACE TO BE. HERE IT IS AND TO BE RESPONSIVE TO DATA WHEN IT COMES AND OTHER P. BEHAVIORAL DATA. BUT- BE- THEY ABOUT. THE NEW YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF. BEING STOLEN CALIFORNIA RIGHT YOU KNOW IT'S A THAT COME TO REGULAR. OF TO THE SYSTEM THAT'S CURRENTLY BEING USED. THE WILL TAKE TIME FOR CAR TO PUT IN PLACE. AND TO. TEST YOU KNOW THE- THEIR ASSUMPTIONS KNOW WE'VE- WE IDENTIFY I THINK THE REPORT WHERE THERE'S LOW HANGING. AND WE EXPECT TO BE. JUDICIOUS IN AND CRY. OF GETTING AFTER THAT STUFF FIRST AND FOREMOST AND- MAKING- YOU KNOW LARGE CONCLUDE. FOR FROM THAT THERE COLLECTION THEY IF THEY WERE AND THEIR SIR EFFORTS. THAN YOU KNOW YOU COULD YOU COULD TEST SOME BASIC ASSUMPTIONS AT LEAST ON THE SUBJECT. SIDE CATCH THE VERY QUICKLY. BUT I'M FOR. YES THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE INTERNET. AND A COMPLEX PROCESS DID NOT THAT. SO I THINK YOU KNOW. FINANCIER QUESTIONS I CAN THERE IS YOU KNOW THE LEGACY OF THE TIME LAG BETWEEN WHEN SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE GONE IN. PLACE THE MONEY THAT'S BEEN SPENT ON THEM AND WHEN WE FIND OURSELVES NOW. SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT NOT ISN'T THE SITUATION OF MISSED OPPORTUNITY WITH RESPECT TO THAT AND- THAT WAS CERTAINLY. NOT FRUSTRATING TO US AS A TEAM BUT WE TRIED TO- BE STRATEGIC AND BE DIRECT ABOUT WHERE CARP SHOULD GO IN ORDER TO. RECTIFY THAT GOING FORWARD. SO I'M I'M- I APPRECIATE THAT- AND- THAT PERSPECTIVE I GUESS- I KNOW I'M GONNA CHANNEL MY- FRUSTRATIONS I THINK FOR- THROUGH THE- WHAT WAS SAID- TO THE FORMER TRANSPORTATION CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY. THAT YOU KNOW YOU WOULD THINK THAT THESE THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT INTO MOTION. A DECADE AGO. AND NOW WE'RE- OVER A DECADE IN AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW OR WE MAY NOT HAVE THE ABILITY. TO KNOW WHETHER THESE PROGRAMS OR EVEN AN ACTIVE OR NOT. AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME THE VERY AGENCY THAT IS. NOW GONNA COME BEFORE US AS A LEGISLATURE IS ASKING FOR MORE MONEY. TELLING US TO THESE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE WORKING OR NOT- SO I THINK THAT'S THE BIG CHALLENGE WE HAVE AS- THROUGH THIS AUDIT AND AS- THE VICTIMS RAISING COMMITTEES AND THROUGH- THE BUDGET PROCESS. IS WE ARE TRYING TO GET. THE CAR BACK TO- GIVE US REAL TIME INFORMATION WHICH IS CRITICAL- AND IF WITH AT THE SAME TIME ALSO. UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY MAY NOT BE VERY OBJECTIVE. IN TERMS OF WHETHER. THE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING OR NOT. I'VE NEVER HAD AN AGENCY TESTIFIED BEFORE. US THAT SAID THEIR PROGRAMS ARE WORKING. THE SAY THAT THERE WORKING ANYMORE FOR. AND WHEN YOU'VE INDICATED THAT THE FACT THAT. THE OBJECTIVES AND THE AND THE- AND THEM- OF THE PROGRAMS ARE NOT ALIGNED WITH THE GOALS AND THE REPORTS- THAT'S VERY DISCONCERTING FOR SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF AND I'M SURE OTHER MEMBERS LEGISLATURE. WHO- PRIDE THEMSELVES ON TRYING TO HOLD ON AGENCIES ACCOUNTABLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOGGY AND I KNOW YOU SERVE UP BUDGET COMMITTEE WITH MAYBE YOU. MIGHT BE PRUDENT TO ASK CAR WITH THEY WANTED TO FOR SOME OTHER BUDGET TO THIS DATA COLLECTION FROM THE THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS WELL AND THIS MAY BE ADDED. TO THE CHAIR MAY BE SOMETHING WHERE YOU KNOW SUB SIX MAP THAT. WILL DO SOME PART PROGRAM EVALUATION AS WELL WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO OUR REMOTE PARTICIPATION- SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI. GETS ON THE WHITE HOUSE KIANA. OKAY WILL COME BACK TO SENATOR WHITE HOUSE YOU LET'S MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON. CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES PLEASE PROCEED MR THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DON'T KNOW IF THIS QUESTION WAS ALREADY ASK LET ME. ASK IT AND I JUST RELY ON YOU JUST TELL ME ABOUT THIS IS QUESTIONS BUT ASK ALREADY ACCORDING TO THE AUDITOR'S REPORTS PAGE THIRTY TWO ONE CAUGHT YOUR ATTENTION PAGE THIRTY TO- THIRTY THROUGH THIRTY THREE YOUR PREVIOUS REPORTED- TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO PAY TWO POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS REBATE TOTALING FIVE POINT. SIX BILLION TO GET FIVE MILLION THEY- ON THE ROAD TO MEET THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS HOW DO YOU HOW DID YOU DETERMINE. THAT YOU WHAT NEEDS OF THE TO SPEND FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN PUBLIC FUNDING TO ACHIEVE THE GOVERNOR'S TARGET TARGET WITHOUT COLLECTING THE VALUATION ARE THE RELEVANT DATA NEEDING- THAT WAS NOTED IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT. IS EVIDENCE DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION. YES SIR BARCELONA CLARIFY THE I'M NOT SPEAK ON OF AUDITORS IT'S REALLY THAT IS BUT I COULD I COULDN'T COVERAGE FOR I WAS PERSPECTIVE I'M HAPPY O TALK ABOUT THAT ISSUE IN THE REPORT IF YOU'D LIKE ME TO. WOULD YOU PLEASE YES SIR SO- THE WAY CARD OBTAINED THAT NUMBER IS THAT THE QUESTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE IS A VERY PERTINENT ONE WHICH WAS. WE HAVE THIS GOAL. IT'S REALLY THE QUESTION WE'VE BEEN ASKING. IN A SENSE WHAT WILL IT TAKE RESOURCE WISE TO GET US TO THAT GOAL. AND WHAT WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED CARD TO HAVE IN RESPONSE WAS TO NOTE. WELL IF WE KNOW IF WE MAKE AN INVESTMENT ON THE FRONT END HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW WE'LL GET OUT IN TERMS OF VEHICLES ON THE BACK END. BUT INSTEAD BECAUSE CARL HASN'T. CONDUCTED THE TYPES OF DATA ANALYSIS THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY. WHAT CAR DID WAS THE INVERSE OF THAT. THEY JUST ASSUMED YOU KNOW A SCENARIO IN WHICH FIVE. MILLION VEHICLES WILL BE SOLD. AND THEN YOU JUST HISTORICAL DATA TO SAY WELL WE ON AVERAGE PAY FOR ABOUT ONE OUT OF TWO IS THAT IS THAT ARE SOLD IN THE CALIFORNIA. IN CALIFORNIA TO SEE THE R. P. THEREFORE WILL JUST DO THE MATH. AND SO THAT TO US IS A BUDGETING EXERCISE. IT'S NOT AN EXERCISE IN TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. WHAT THE PROGRAM IS SET TO DO WHICH IS YOU. MONEY I FRONT TO GET A RETURN ON THE SUFFICIENCY OF THAT VEHICLE MARKET GOING FORWARD. OKAY SO WHAT IN YOUR OPINION WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE. A TAXPAYERS MONEY IN ORDER TO REACH YOUR GOAL. TO REACH THE GOVERNOR'S GO. I'M AFRAID I CANNOT SPEAK TO THAT NOW IF CARP WERE TO HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVELY GIVEN REBATE IS AT YOU KNOW BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT ON AVERAGE WHAT IS A REMAKE IT YOU IN TERMS OF NOT JUST REAL GHG EMISSIONS. BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF MARKET RESPONSE IN TERMS OF HOW WE INVEST NOW TO DRIVE. PRICES DOWN BUT WE KNOW WHEN WE'VE MADE SUFFICIENT- INVESTMENTS THAT INCENTIVES MAY NOT KNOW HOW TO BE NECESSARY IF I HAD DONE THE RESEARCH TO KNOW OUR INCENTIVE AMOUNTS THE MOST AFFECTED THEY COULD BE. THEN WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO RUN THOSE NUMBERS FOR YOU SERVER RIGHT NOW. TARGET OR NOT YOU KNOW WHAT AND WHAT ALL THAT ANYBODY COULD GIVEN ITS LACK OF DATA WHICH IS TO SAY WELL WE'RE JUST REVERSE THE QUESTION KIND OF ON ITS ON ITS HERE AND RESPOND BACK ABOUT YOU KNOW. GIVING HISTORICAL. TRENDS WHAT THIS WOULD LOOK LIKE IN BUDGET TURNS. OKAY THANK YOU TEACHER I WANT TO HAVE OUT OF THE QUESTION BUT- YEAH. RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SIMPLY MEMBER GIPSON PERHAPS WE CAN CIRCLE BACK TO THOSE QUESTIONINGS OF CARB WHEN WE BRING UP THE NEXT PANEL. WITH WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO. LET ME ASK FEDERAL ACCOUNTS HE'S ON THE LINE. IF NOT THEN WE WILL MOVE TO SENATOR BACKER. RIGHT. THANK YOU WHICH ONE TO BUY IT CONFIRM HERE M. THE HEADLINES WERE QUITE DRAMATIC EXIT IS NOTHING HERE SHOWS THAT CARBS PROGRAMS ARE COURT CORRECT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT AN E. D. D. S. SITUATION WITH SIGNIFICANT WASTE IT SEEMS LIKE THE MAIN FINDING IS THAT CORBYN CLICKED AS MUCH DATA AS THEY SHOULD- PROBABLY IN. BENEFITS AND POSSIBLY COULD BE OPTIMIZING THE USE THE FUNDS BETTER IS THAT SEPARATE. YES THAT'S CORRECT IN THE SENSE THAT WE YOU KNOW WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE SUFFICIENT DATA TO MAKE INFORMED DETERMINATIONS ABOUT THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF PROGRAMS OR HOW EFFECTIVE THEY ARE COMPARED TO OTHER USES JEFFERIES OF THE MONEY. FOR THAT REASON YOU KNOW WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE IN OUR REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT PROGRAMS THAT SHOULD GO AWAY PROGRAMS THAT SHOULD BE EXPANDED WE CERTAINLY WOULD LOOK TO MAKE THOSE TYPES OF RECOMMENDATIONS WHERE THE DATA ARE AVAILABLE SO- OUR CONCLUSION HERE IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THERE SOMEWHERE ON THE SPECTRUM BETWEEN. YOU KNOW EFFECTIVE AT ALL BUT THE EVIDENCE REALLY ISN'T ISN'T THERE TO SHOW US WHERE ARE NOT CONTINUE ON A GIVEN PROGRAM WOODLAND WHICH OF COURSE INHIBITS STATE'S ABILITY TO PICK THE WINNERS AND ENSURE WE- RECONSIDER THE LOSERS. THAT'S RIGHT YES AND I'M OFFERED. IN CHILE JIMMY QUESTIONS ASKED A RELATIVE BANG FOR THE BUCK BUT- I JUST WANTED THAT CAUGHT ON THE RECORD THAT WE'RE NOT SAYING CRISTINA BAD JOB. WHICH IS LOOKING FOR- ACCESS TO MORE. DATA AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE OPTIMIZING AS WELL AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR WE'RE GONNA THANK YOU I THINK THIS FACT CONCLUDES THE WHO I HAVE ON THE LIST TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE STATE AUDITOR LAWCENTER Y. CASKEY IS ON- IF NOT I WILL THANK THE AUDITOR AND HER TEAM- MR RYAN ALREADY THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- THE- OVERVIEW OF THE OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AND WITH THAT ME ASK ONE MORE TIME IF CENTER THE WHITE HOUSE GUISAN. RESPONSE FOR THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. WE HAVE RICHARD CORY THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER JENNIFER PRESS CHIEF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION COMMUNITIES DIVISION SAID THE VERGE S. CHIEF MOBILE SOURCE CONTROL DIVISION. AND LET'S GO AHEAD AND- BEGIN WITH THE NEXT PANEL PLEASE. MISTER COREY. YES THANKS THANKS SHERRY AND I HAVE BEEN HAVING SOME- CONNECTIVE ANY ISSUE SO DR BURGESS WILL BACK ME UP IF I DROP OFF DURING MY REMARKS BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO YOU. AND THE MEMBERS AND THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE STATE AUDITOR. IN HER TEAM FOR THEIR WORK ON THE ON IT OVER THE PAST YEAR. AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE AUDITORS FINDINGS AND OUR COMMITMENT OUR COMMITMENT TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS WHICH I'LL BE DISCUSSING IN A MOMENT. BUT FIRST I'D LIKE TO START BY DISCUSSING CARDS TRACK RECORD IN REDUCING EMISSIONS AND IMPROVING AIR QUALITY. OVER THE LAST COUPLE DECADES WE'VE SEEN OZONE IN THE SOUTH COAST INSTANTIATED GRAYSON SIGNIFICANTLY MORE OF THE REGION IS NOW MEETING FEDERAL AIR QUALITY STANDARDS. FOR OZONE THIS OCCURRED WHILE THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES MILES TRAVELLED DRIVEN. POPULATION AND ECONOMY CONTINUE TO GROW DRAMATICALLY. SIMILAR WE WERE SAYING MUCH LESS PARTICULATE MATTER IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY BY COLLABORATING WITH THEIR DISTRICT ON A RECENT STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO EXCEL RATE REDUCTIONS FROM AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT. TRUCKS BUSES RESIDENTIAL WOOD BURNING WE SEE LOWER PM TWO POINT FIVE LEVELS ACROSS THE- WITH ALL ALSO SEEN TREMENDOUS REDUCTIONS ARE TOXIC EXPOSURE. FROM DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER HEAVY METALS AND TOXIC VOCS OVER THE PAST DECADES EXAMPLES SINCE NINETEEN NINETY. CANCER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DIESEL PM HAS DECREASED BY OVER SEVENTY PERCENT. WELL DIESEL VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED INCREASED. 80% FINALLY THE RESULT IN CALIFORNIA'S GREENHOUSE GAS PROGRAMS IS CLEAR WAS CALIFORNIA CHIEF IT'S TWENTY TWENTY GHG TARGET. ONE SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER. SHORT WHILE AGO BY FOR YEARS OR YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. OUR WE RECOGNIZE MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO MEET OUR CLIMATE IN AIR QUALITY GOALS AS 90% OF CALIFORNIANS AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED. STILL BRING ABOUT HEALTHCARE. WE AGREE THAT THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE MORE IMPLEMENTING MEASURES TO SUPPORT THE TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION MOBILE. AND OTHER SOURCES. AN UNPRECEDENTED SCALE AND SCOPE INSIDE OF THE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS I WILL NOTE THAT WE HAVE THE MOST CHALLENGING AIR QUALITY PROBLEMS IN THE COUNTRY. AND SOME OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS GHG REDUCTION TARGETS. AND HAS BEEN THE CASE FOR DECADES FEDERAL AND STATE LAW REQUIRES REQUIRES MULTIPLE STRATEGIES TO WORK TOGETHER. WE ARE REPORT NOTES OVERESTIMATES GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS THAT INDIVIDUAL TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS AND SHE- WHEN THE AUTOMATED NUMBER FINDINGS FOCUSED ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN REGULATIONS AND INCENTIVES TARGETING THE SAME EMISSIONS OR QUESTIONS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS TO BETTER ISOLATE. THE BENEFITS OF EACH. NO DOUBT MORE DATA AS WELL AS FURTHER ANALYSIS OF DATA THAT IS COLLECTED IT WILL BE IMPORTANT IN DIESEL. BUT THERE ARE SOME NEW ONES AROUND THIS-ISSUE SOME BACKGROUND MAY BE HELPFUL. AS PART OF OUR CONTROL STRATEGY AND HER LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION WE ACQUIRED MULTIPLE COMPLEMENTARY STRATEGIES SOME REGULATORY AND OTHERS AND SENATE BASED. DESIGN WORK TOGETHER TO COLLECTIVELY REDUCE EMISSIONS. AS AN EXAMPLE IS THE STATE'S THEIR STRATEGY WAS DISCUSSED STATE ZIP REGULATION REQUIRES THAT MANUFACTURERS TO PRODUCE THESE VEHICLES FOR SALE THEY'RE ALSO INCENTIVES SUCH AS CTRP THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT. CARPOOL LANE ACCESS TO ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIANS TO BUY AND DRIVE SETS IN PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE THE VEHICLES CAN BE CAN AND CHARGED. REMOVE ANY ONE OF THESE PIECES WOULD HAMPER EARLY DEPLOYMENT IS S. AS NOTED YET HAPPENS ADS IN THE UNITED STATES ZAB MANUFACTURE BACK SEVERAL MANUFACTURERS OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ALL THE WAY UP TO TRUCKS COMING CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURING COMING TO CALIFORNIA. THE L. A. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION WILL SAY ON ON RECORD THAT'S BECAUSE. THE STATE'S POLICIES HERE. I WELL THIS COMP POLICY A GENERATE AS NEED AS NEEDED APPROACH FOR TRANCE THE- SECTOR ZERO MOTIONS IT'S CHALLENGING TO ACCURATELY ATTRIBUTE BENEFITS. TO EACH INDIVIDUAL COMPONENT THE STRATEGY AS WELL AS DISCUSSED LAST NOW. TO HELP EXPLAIN HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS IMAGINE YOU'RE SERVING A CONSUMER. WHO RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS APP. DID THEY PURCHASE IT BECAUSE THE CTRP. BECAUSE THE VEHICLE WAS DUE TO IS YET DOES THAT REGULATION. BECAUSE OF ACCESS TO AN HOV LANE STICKER. THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT RECENT INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. ET PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS OR PERHAPS% ALL OF THE ABOVE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR IS A TRICKY THING TO NAIL DOWN SO IF YOU SURVEYS SOMEONE AND ASK WHY DO YOU PURCHASE THAT YEAH. IT'S LIKELY A COMBINATION OF THINGS NOW NOT RESPOND THE CLEAN CUT RESPONSE ARE PAYING 10% FEDERAL TAX CREDIT AND SO ON. THAT'S THE CHALLENGE. HI THIS ISN'T HOW CAN. GENERALLY OPERATE IN FURTHER ACADEMIC LITERATURE IS DEMONSTRATING THAT FREQUENTLY CONSUMERS ARE GENERALLY UNABLE TO QUANTIFY. CHOICES AT THIS LEVEL. OF COURSE THIS DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T DO OUR BEST TO FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT METHODOLOGY AND APPROACH TO MEASURING PROGRAMMATIC IMPACTS. NOR DOES IT NEED WEEK NOTHING MORE WE CAN AND WE WILL. BUT IN THE CASE OF INCENTIVES AND CONSUMER CHOICE JUST WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THE CHALLENGES. THAT ARE PRESENT. WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING OUR BEST TO IMPLEMENT THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS. SOME MAY TAKE SOME TIME ONCE RESOURCE BUT BEFORE I MOVE ON I WANTED TO LOOK AT OUR MISSION INVENTORY DOESN'T COUNT FOR THE COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES AND VOICE OVER COUNTY OF EMISSIONS BENEFITS TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA'S EMISSIONS OF CRITERIA POLLUTANTS. EMISSIONS OF GHGS. EMISSION INVENTORY. QUANTIFIES THE AMOUNT OF FOSSIL FUEL USED IN TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AND THE RESULTING EMISSIONS FROM DARKNESS. WHICH POLICIES LED TO THE DISPLACEMENT OF FOSSIL FUEL VEHICLES WITH JABS. SENATE MAJORITY HAS A CRITICAL ROLE IN BOTH TRACKING OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS OUR EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS AND IDENTIFY WHERE WE NEED TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS IN SHORT. EMISSION REDUCTIONS WE'RE SEEING IN OUR AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE PROGRAM FOR DECADES ARE REAL AND BORN OUT BY FEDERAL RATHER FUEL CONSUMPTION IN AIR QUALITY DATA. HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THE GENERAL ISSUES I'LL NOW TURN OF THE ADDITIONAL AUDIT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS SPECIFIC ON THE FINDING THAT THERE AREAS WHERE ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS. WOULD HELP KERR MORE STRATEGICALLY IMPLEMENTED IN SEVERAL BANDS WE AGREE. HAVING MORE DATA IS ALSO BENEFICIAL AS A FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THE DATA THAT IS COLLECTED WHEN DESIGNING IMPLEMENTING AND EVALUATING CALIFORNIANS THE MOTION CONTROL STRATEGIES. AND WE ALREADY STARTED ADDRESSING THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND I'M COMMITTED TO DO MORE IN THE NEXT YEAR FOR FURTHER DRESSED ON. IT'LL TAKE MORE TIME TO THE WORST AND TIME TO WORK THROUGH THE PUBLIC PROCESS DETERMINE THE MOST EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE MECHANISMS TO COLLECT AND ANALYZE. ALL DATA AND INFORMATION AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO DO IT. A NUMBER OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL LIKELY COME WITH AN ASSESSMENT ADDITIONAL STAFFING AND RESOURCE WILL BE NECESSARY TO AVOID. RECKON RESOURCES AWAY FROM. REGULATORY EFFORTS TO FURTHER REDUCE OXIC AIR POLLUTANTS FROM TRUCKS SHIPS. REPUBLICAN SOURCES. IN REGARD TO THE AUDITORS FINDING REGARDING SOCIO ECONOMIC BENEFITS FOR CALIFORNIANS ARE CAR EQUITY PROGRAMS. THAT WHILE WE AGREED THAT WE SHOULD IMPROVE OUR DATA COLLECTION PROCESS TO BETTER QUANTIFY IMPORTANT BENEFITS THESE PROGRAMS REMAIN CRITICAL FOR EQUITY PURPOSES WHILE PURSUING THEIR CLIMATE GOALS. CARDS EQUITY PROGRAMS ARE DEVELOPED AND MODIFIED THROUGH AN ANNUAL PUBLIC PROCESS WHICH INVOLVES INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS PARTICULARLY EQUITY STAKEHOLDERS AND REACH OUT TO INCLUDE. IN THE METHOD. AS WELL AS GUIDED BY LEGISLATORS. FOR EXAMPLE THE CHARGE HEAD INITIATIVE PASSED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN BY FORMER. PRO TEM SENATOR- DELEON AND CLEAN CARS FOR ALL. A STATUE BY SYMBOL MEMBER GROUP. FOR THE EQUITY PRO MORE THAN ANY OTHERS VOICES OF THOSE EQUITY GROUPS AND COMMUNITIES THAT STANDARD BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM MUST BE CENTRAL TO PROGRAM DESIGN. TODAY MANY OF THE SOCIO ECONOMIC BENEFITS ASSEMBLY QUALITATIVE AS NOTED. THESE INCLUDE BENEFITS SUCH AS MORE RELIABLE ACCESS TO CLEAN TRANSPORTATION FOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS IMPROVE FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES TRACTOR REPLACEMENTS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. CLEANER TRUCKS ARE MOST IMPACTED ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE MOVEMENTS. OUR CARBON KNOWLEDGES THE AUDITORS FINDINGS QUANTIFICATION SOCIO ECONOMIC BENEFITS ACROSS EQUITY PROGRAMS WOULD PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO DETERMINE WHO WHO MATIC SUCCESS. AS FOR APPLYING. WE'LL WORK THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO SO IN A WAY THAT IS SUPPORTIVE OF THE GROUPS ZENSAR ADDITIONALLY THE ARTIST HONORED AUDITOR FOR FILTER CHARGE AND LOOK AT THE PROGRAMS TO THE LANDS WAS A RATHER LANSING GHGS. I MUST ALSO NOTE THE TRANCE. SECTOR IS OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF GHGS. ROOMS THAT FORM- OZONE AND TOXIC POLLUTANTS LAST. MOST OF OUR MEASURES ARE DESIGNED REDUCING EMISSIONS OF OZONE FORMING AND TOXIC BLOOMS AS WELL AS JUNE CHOOSE. FOCUSING ON A TRIPLE PLAY. PLUS UNDERSTATING THE BENEFITS WHEN SIMPLY LOOK AT THREE GHG PERSPECTIVE NO DOUBT MEETING ARE HEALTHY. ALL THE INCLINE TARGETS WILL REQUIRE US TO PUSH HARDER ON THE SECTOR WE WILL. WE AGREE THAT THE AUDITOR WITH THE HONOR THAT REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS FROM THE SECTOR IS IMPORTANT. AND MORE WE NEED TO BE DONE TO DRIVE DOWN EMISSIONS TO MEET OF THE TWENTY THIRTY AND BEYOND TARGETS. WILL ALSO EXAMINE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS INCLUDING DRIVING DOWN EMISSIONS FROM THE STATE'S LARGEST STATIONARY SOURCES SUCH AS REQUIREMENTS. AND NATURAL GAS EMITTERS IS THEIR CHIEF SOURCE OF ROOMS AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO OZONE TOXIC POLLUTANTS RECOMMENDED TO DO SO AS WE UPDATE THE STATE'S SCOPING PLAN THAT IS COMING UP. IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS IT WILL BE LAUNCHED. OUR LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING THE ON AMPLE ROCK. WILL LAY TO THE DATA COLLECTION- WITH ME TODAY ARE AT TWO DIVISION CHIEFS FROM CARMEN WHO OVERSEE A NUMBER OF THE PROGRAM'S DISCUSSED IN THE AUDIT. CITY BURGESS WHO OVERSEES MOBILE SOURCE CONTROL DIVISION ENGINE FOR RESCUE OVERSEAS ASSISTING ANIMAL TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNITY WAS DIVISION AND WITHOUT SHARE I CONCLUDE MY REMARKS. RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER COREY AND I KNOW WE HAVE A NUMBER OF- QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS AND APPRECIATE YOUR OPENING COMMENTS. AND I WE'RE GONNA GO TO JUST MOVE INTO QUESTIONINGS WILL START WITH MEMBERS HERE IN THE IN THE ROOM AND I'M GONNA DEFER. TO SENATOR BRADFORD WHO IS CHAIRING ANOTHER COMMITTEE. AND THAT NOW IS JOINT ASSISTANT BRADFORD. THANK YOU CHAIR SALAS AND I WANT TO THANK THIS COMMITTEE FOR YOUR COURAGEOUS LEADERSHIP- THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE FOR APPROVING MY REQUEST LAST YEAR TO AUDIT CAR. AS WE ALL KNOW ALL NOMINAL THIS AUDIT WAS NOT ONLY NECESSARILY NECESSARY BUT LONG OVER DUE. WHEN I READ YOUR REPORT I HAVE TO ADMIT I WASN'T SHOCKED. BUT ONLY AMAZED THAT IT WAS WORSE THAN WE COULD'VE EVER ENVISION. BECAUSE OF THIS COMMITTEES THAT MAKE COMMUNITIES I SAY THAT I REPRESENT I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE FAILURE OF THE CAR PROGRAMS TO TRANSLATE THE STATE POLICIES INTO REAL RESULTS ON THE GROUND. THIS AUDIT REVEALED SOMETHING EVEN MORE PROBLEMATIC WHICH IS A LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY RESPONSIVENESS AND RESPECT OF THE LEGISLATURE. IT IS BAD ENOUGH FOR THE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS TO BE PRIORITIZED OVER PEOPLE. THEY HEAR THE REPORT BY MISTER CURRY AT AS THE REPORTS AUDIT STATED IT'S INDEFENSIBLE AND ALMOST INSULTING. ARE THERE ARE MANY ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS TODAY AND I WELCOME THAT CONVERSATION BUT- I HAVE TO GET TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE BUT I JUST WANT TO RUN TO SOMETHING REAL QUICK- I DON'T THINK MISTER CURRY FOR BEING HERE TODAY BUT I WOULD LIKE TO START. WITH HOW CARP EVALUATED SOCIAL. ECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENTS OF ITS PROGRAMS CAR STATE IN RESPONSE TO THIS AUDIT THAT YOU SURVEYS FOCUS GROUPS. AND OTHER DATA TO EVALUATE PROGRAM EQUITY CAR BOSSES STATED. THAT STAFF WILL EVALUATE WHETHER TO MODIFY FUTURE GRANT SOLICITATION THROUGH JUST MORE MATRIX. ARBOR THIS AUDIT FOUND CAR DOES NOT. CONSISTENT CONSISTENTLY COLLECT DATA TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S EQUITY PROGRAMS ACTUALLY PROVIDE SOCIAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS. AS INTENDED. ANOTHER EXAMPLE CAR FINANCING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM INTENDS TO HELP LOW INCOME CONSUMERS FINANCE CLEAN VEHICLES INCREASE THEIR CREDIT SCORES YET IN FIVE YEARS THIS PROGRAM BY CAR HAS NOT COLLECTED NOT ONE SCINTILLA OF DATA THAT ALLOW IT TO REPORT ON THE BENEFITS THAT THEY CLAIM THE A G. CARBS SLIDE PARTICIPANT. LOAN REPAYMENT RATES AS A MEASURE OF SUCCESS YET THE AUDIT FOUND CARP DOES NOT COLLECT DATA ON THOSE RATES IT DOES NOT EVEN HAVE ACCESS TO THE LOAN DATA. THIS IS A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF CARP USING AND I'M GOING TO CHANGE IT PIMPING LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AS POSTER CHILD FOR THEIR POLICIES WITHOUT FOLLOWING THROUGH THE DELIVER ON THE RESULTS THAT ARE PROMISED TO THESE COMMUNITIES. IN FACT CARBS GRIPES ME IN FACT THE AUDIT DESCRIBES CARP EVALUATION OF SOCIOECONOMIC BENEFITS AND THIS PROGRAM AGAIN AS DISINGENUOUS AT BEST. GIVEN THAT WHY SHOULD THIS LEGISLATURE TAKE CARP SERIOUSLY WHEN YOU STATE YOU WILL BE RESPONSIVE TO AUDIT FINDINGS. FRANKLY I THINK YOUR TRACK RECORD GIVES UP CALL FOR ALARM. THAT WE ALL SHOULD BE CONCERNED WITH. ARE YOU I MEAN EVEN STATE RECORD LAW REQUIRES YOU TO ON YOUR CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM DESIGNED PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES RESULT IN JOB CREATIONS AND THAT THOSE JOBS TO BE TRACKED THIS IS STATE LAW BUT THREE YEARS LATER. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CARP UPDATED GUIDELINES SPECIFIED JOB CREATION AND TRAINING SHOULD FOCUS ON DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES HOWEVER DESPITE ALL THIS TIME. AND SUPPOSED TO LIVE WORK THAT WAS DONE I THOUGHT IT BOB KARP HAS FAILED TO DO SO IN A TIMELY AND COMPREHENSIVE WAY. THIS AUDIT REVIEWED NINE PROGRAMS WOULD JOB REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. AND ONLY THREE HAD ANY JOB DATA AT ALL. TWO OTHERS HIT DATA COLLECTED BUT NOT REPORTED THIS REFLECTS A FUNDAMENTAL FAILURE TO DELIVER ON THESE IMPORTANT EQUITY GOALS THAT CARPET SELF IDENTIFIES AS IMPORTANT. A LOT OF ALL OF THIS AND ALL THE AUDIT FINDINGS I THINK WE HAVE TO SERIOUSLY RECONSIDER THAT THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND AUTHORITY. THE STATE HAS GIVEN CAR UNTIL YOU CAN ACTUALLY MEET THE STATUTORY AND PROGRAMMATIC GOALS. THE FAILURES IN THIS AUDIT TO GO BEYOND SIMPLY MISSING DATA OR INEFFECTIVE. I MEAN I SHOULD SAY THE FAILURES IN THIS ARTICLE BEYOND SIMPLY MISSED MISSING THAT ARE INEFFECTIVE ANALYSIS. THIS AUDIT REVEALS A FUNDAMENTAL FAILURE OF ACCOUNTABLE. TO BE ACCOUNTABLE NOT ONLY TO THE PUBLIC BUT TO THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY AND TO YOUR ALL GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OUR CLIMATE GOALS ARE AMBITIOUS AND DEMAND BETTER USE OF ALL. IF WE'RE WANTED G. VENOM THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR CARP GIVEN ITS POWER AND ITS VALUE TO LIVE UP TO ITS POWERS OVER THE LAST. TWO DECADES. CURRENT THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD- YOU'RE A SPECIFIC QUESTION IN THERE BUT DEFINITELY MAJOR POINTS- WITH HOW YOU FEEL. MY QUESTION IS WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SHOW ANYTHING FOR BUT CONTINUE TO. WASTE CONSTITUENTS MONEY- MISTER COREY PLEASE- EVERY DOLLAR IN THE LEGISLATURE HAS APPROPRIATED WHETHER IT BE FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES MISSION TRUCKS LOWER MISSION CLEANER TRACTORS IS ACCOUNTED FOR DOCUMENTED PUBLICLY SOLICITED SOMEONE US PUBLIC SOLICITATION GOES OUT REPORTED THOSE PROGRAMS THAT LED TO A CORDON PURCHASES THAT ARE OPERATING IN LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES DIESEL TRUCKS TWO ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS. LOWER MISSION TRACTORS AND REDUCING PM TWO POINT FIVE IN THE BALLOT IN THE VALLEY. CLEANER EQUIPMENT THAT'S OPERATING IN OUR MOST IMPACTED COURTS RAIL YARDS AND WAREHOUSES EVERY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT EVERY RECIPIENT OF THOSE DOLLARS INAPPROPRIATE BY THE LEGISLATURE DOCUMENT COUNTY BOARD. IN RECORDED ON. KERN APPROPRIATE AND PER GUIDE THAT IS SUBJECT TO PUBLIC REVIEW METHOD METHODS THAT WE GO TO DOCUMENT WE'RE GOING TO TRY. NO A REPORT THE SOLICITATION WHICH IS ULTIMATELY ACTED ON BY OUR BOARD THE PUBLIC HEARING SO WELL DOCUMENTED WELL REPORTED THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH ANY. LEGISLATOR OR YOUR STAFF GO THROUGH ALL THE SPECIFICS OVER EVERYONE OF THOSE DOLLARS. THANK YOU MISTER COREY UNDER THANK YOU I'M GONNA GO BACK AND FORTH BODY CLEARLY DOESN'T SUPPORT A SINGLE THING THAT HE JUST SAID I HAD NONE OF THIS HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED AS CLEARLY STATED IN THE AUDIT. WILL MOVE ON I ACTUALLY HAVE A QUESTION IF WE MAY MISTER COREY I KNOW IN TWENTY NINETEEN WILL YOU KNOW YOU SAID YOU SAID THAT WITH LEGISLATORS AND WE DID THAT AND YOU'VE GIVEN ME INFORMATION I KNOW THE INFORMATION THE CAR PROVIDED TO MY OFFICE OR THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE- CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM- BY LOOK WHERE DISTRICTS. AND SO WITH THAT DATA SHOWED IS- ERR DISTRICTS LIKE THOSE IN THE BAY AREA RECEIVED YOU KNOW MAJORITY OF THE FUNDING WHEN I LOOKED AT THE DATA WAS NEARLY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WENT TO THE BAY AREA I COMPARED THAT JUST TO SOME AREAS AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND KERN RECEIVED ONLY FOUR HUNDRED AND ELEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS WHICH IS ABOUT POINT ZERO SIX PERCENT. OF THE FUNDS AND IMPERIAL WRIST IMPERIAL VALLEY IMPERIAL COUNTY ACTUALLY RECEIVED EVEN LESS ONLY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS IN REBATES SO THIS TELLS ME IS THAT THOSE LIVING IN AREAS WITH BETTER QUALITY RECEIVING MUCH MORE FUNDING TO IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY WHILE AREAS WITH HIGH POLLUTION LEVELS OR SEEMINGLY GIVEN LESS ATTENTION AND FUNDING. SO YOU KNOW ASKS THE AUTO EARLIER YOU KNOW WHY WAS WERE DESIGNATED FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SPENT OUTSIDE OF THOSE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. YOU CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND WHY THAT'S THE CASE. I THINK- THE COMMITTEE WOULD APPRECIATE IT. YEAH WE ARE THE CTRP PROGRAM IS ONE LEGISLATIVELY APPROPRIATED TO INSANE EARNED VALUE CONSUMER PROGRAM BASICALLY TO SUPPORT LEASES OR SALE WHICH IS FIRST COME FIRST SERVE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE TO THE ENTIRE STATE- LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION IN A NUMBER OF LAWS AND PASSED THE DEFINING ITS OPERATION I AND IT THERE'S ALSO A LOW INCOME ELEMENT C. A. R. P. WHICH WILL BE LOOK OVERALL CD R. P. AND SAY WELL HOW MUCH IS GOING TO. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME. YES ABANDONED LOW INCOME TO GET SMALLER 5% BUT A BLANK LAY OUT YOUR QUESTION I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION ABOUT LOOKING AT. CTRP AND RELATED PROGRAMS FARMER. WHICH IS CLEANER TRACTORS GENERAL 80% OF THAT ACTUALLY GOES INTO THE VALLEY. I TO REDUCE DIESEL PM AND OTHER TOXIC POLLUTANTS HEAVY DUTY PROGRAMS FOR HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS ARE OVER 70% OF THOSE END UP OPERATING IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO DOES VARY BY PROGRAM WILL DO VARIES BY. THE WAY THIS BILL BASIC DESIGN. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT TRUCKS YOU LOOK AT TRACTORS. ARE DOMINATING LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN SEEKING ARCADY ARE BOTH LOCAL TAX AND LOW. INCOME IS ABOUT 25% THANK RISK WOULD YOU JUST WITH THAT I THAT A- OLDER VEHICLE WE TAKE OFF THE ROAD WOULD HELP IMPROVE AND MAKE CALIFORNIA REACH ITS CLIMATE GOALS FASTER. I WOULD IN FACT I WOULD ADD TO THAT AND SAY THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM. WHICH BASICALLY IS DIRECTED AT LOWER INCOME FOLKS. THEY BRING OUT LOW THEY BRING AN OLDER DIRTIER VEHICLE RECEIVED A IN THIS IS ALSO STATE APPROPRIATED LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATED. FUNDING TO GET A MUCH CLEANER VEHICLE THE VEHICLES ARE REPLACING OR OVER TWENTY YEARS OLD. ON AVERAGE YOU'RE GETTING A VEHICLE THAT'S THAT'S ABOUT FOUR YEARS OR NEWER AND FAR FAR CLEANER FACT THAT THE HIGHEST SELLING VEHICLES. WILL ABORT CLEAN CARS FOR ALL DIRECTED LOWER INCOME FOLKS. ARE RIGHT PLUGINS ARE HYBRID HYBRID VEHICLES AND EVEN ELECTRIC VEHICLES. SO YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN IT TAKES THE OLDER ARE YOUR PEOPLE OFF THE ROAD. IN AND GETS LOWER INCOME PEOPLE IN A NEWER. BETTER PERFORMING VEHICLE THAT STAYS IN FUTURE. AND SO I WOULD IMAGINE THAT MISTER COREY THAT WOULD BE THAT CVR P. PRO HELPS CAL. REACHES CLIMATE GOALS- THAT'S CORRECT ASSUMPTION I'M SO. BASED OFF YOUR ANSWER. THAT IS OKAY SOMETHING. I JUST WANT TO ASK BECAUSE I WAS TO WITH OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE AND- THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF CARP IS GOING TO BE PUSHING FOR AN ALLOCATION OF FUNDS FOR THE C. V. R. P. PROGRAM BECAUSE IN THE GOVERNOR'S INITIAL BUDGET IT'S ELIMINATED. AND SO FROM CARBS PERSPECTIVE TRYING TO MEET MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS WILL YOU BE PUSHING TO REINSTATE THAT MONEY INTO THE BUDGET ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION. THAT WOULD THE COURSES YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION IN CONSULTATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE THAT'S SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIC APPROPRIATION- IN A PLAYED OUT IN THE BUDGET PROCESS BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS. WE KNOW WE NEED MORE ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN LONDON LET ME BE REALLY CLEAR ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK THE NEXT GUY THE MESSAGE WAS MUTED. DURING THE CONVERSATION. NOT ONLY DO WE NEED ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO TRANSITION TO REDUCED YIELDS CLINICIANS. WE CAN'T GET TO OUR HEALTH BASED AIR QUALITY STANDARDS STANDARD YOU TALK ABOUT IN THE VALLEY AND SOUTH COAST. WITHOUT TRANSFORMING THE TRANSPORTATION. YOU DO THE ANALYSIS IT CAN'T HAPPEN. I AM IN NO DOUBT I TALKED ABOUT THE FACT WE ARE HAPPY TO COUNTRIES EV'S. AND WE HAVE THE MAJOR. THE MAJOR EVEY MANUFACTURE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE. ZERO EMISSIONS FORKLIFTS AND YOUR MISSION BUSES AND TRANSIT BUS MANUFACTURERS COMING TO CALIFORNIA. BUT THE POINT THAT THE AUTHOR MAY GOD BE. WITH THIS AGREEMENT WE NEED MORE WE NEED TO KNOW FASTER. APPRECIATE THAT AND- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IT'S LUKE'S THE LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION FOR SOME OF THE MEMBERS THAT REPRESENT. SOME OF THE HIGHER POLLUTION AIR DISTRICTS AND ONE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE FUNDS. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT TWO HUNDRED AND NEARLY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION GOING TO THE BAY AREA. AND POINT 006% GOING TO PLACES LIKE KERN COUNTY WITH. FOUR HUNDRED AND- ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IT. IT DOESN'T SEEM. THERE BE IS PRIOR. THOSE NANA AREAS TO RECEIVE SOME OF THIS FUNDING TO HELP OFFSET AND HELP CALIFORNIA MEET ITS GOALS- BECAUSE I MEAN IF CALIFORNIA WERE TO ADOPT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE WAY IT IS WITHOUT-THE C. V. R. P. PROGRAM THE FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR REBATE WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL THOSE LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS- IF THEY CABS- PARTAKE IN THE SEVERE P. PROGRAM. HI THIS IS JENNIFER GRASSO THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD IT LOOKS LIKE RICHARD ADAMS INTERNET CONNECTIVITY. HAS AT WORKING OUT MANY I AM. DR BURGESS DID YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT SENIOR PAYING- JUST THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND THINGS LIKE TEND TO BE HERE- AND FOR LETTING ME PINCH HIT FOR A FOR A MISTER COREY. SO I'LL JUST WRITE THAT YOU SEE THE R. P. EXISTS ALONGSIDE A NUMBER OF OTHER EQUITY PROGRAMS INCLUDING CLEAN CARS FROM WHICH WE'VE DISCUSSED TODAY. THAT'S RESULTED IN ELEVEN THOUSAND CAR SCRAPPED REPLACED ON THE ROAD AND THAT FUNDING GOES TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS- AND PRIORITY COMMUNITIES THE FINANCING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WHICH IS ALSO BEEN DISCUSSED AS BENEFITTED TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED. LOW INCOME CONSUMERS AND I DO WANNA TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CRACK SOMETHING I HEARD EARLIER WHICH HAS TO DO WITH THE INTEREST RATES INTEREST RATES IN THIS PROGRAM ARE CAPPED AT 8212% AND THE AVERAGE CONSUMER RECEIVES. A RATE OF. ABOUT FIVE POINT 6% THANK YOU- I DON'T THINK THAT A- WHAT HAPPENS TO LOWER CUSTOMERS THEY DON'T RECEIVE THE SENIOR P. REBATE. UNIMAGINED THEN THEY'D BE PRICED OUT AND THEN AGAIN. I KNOW MISTER COREY SAID. YOU KNOW IT'S ON A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS BUT THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE IN ALIGNMENT WITH. TRYING TO GET THE MOST AMOUNT OF REDUCTIONS ARE BANG FOR BUCK- THAT THE AUDITOR TALKED ABOUT IN SOME OF THESE HIGH ATTAINMENT AREAS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT. WHY WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT. YEAH CHAIRMAN THIS IS A MISTER COREY RICHARD I JUST READ JOIN YOU MIGHT SIGNAL WAS INTERRUPTED SO IF ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE YOUR QUESTION THAT THEY CAN RESPOND. TO MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE QUESTION IS THAT IT'S RELATED TO OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOW INCOME PARTICIPANTS TO PARTICIPATE AND RECEIVE A CLEANER VEHICLE IT'S NOT THROUGH THE CVR P. PROGRAM. ONE ADDITIONAL PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT I THINK MIGHT BE HELPFUL AND IS RELEVANT HERE WHICH IS THAT CLEAN FUEL REWARDS PROGRAM. WHICH IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT COMES FROM OR ELSE IF THIS PROGRAMS UTILITIES ACROSS THE STATE HAVE COME TOGETHER TO OFFER FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS ON THE HOOD- FOR IT CONSUMERS LOOKING TO PURCHASE A NEW VEHICLE SOTHAT THAT IS ALSO ANOTHER AVENUE FOR FOLKS WHO ARE LOOKING TO PURCHASE A CLEAN. NEW VEHICLE IN ADDITION TO FINANCING ASSISTANCE. IN THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM. I'M WHAT THOSE ADDITIONAL PER. BECAUSE YOU KNOW DAUGHTER AND MENTIONED OVERLAP. ARE WE STILL HEARING. THESE PROGRAMS TOWARDS THESE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE LEASES COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DEFINITELY A- HIGH ATTAINMENT. POLLUTED AREAS OF THE STATE. WE ARE IN LET ME- SPEAK SPECIFICALLY CHAIR OF THAT QUESTIONS ARE THINKING ABOUT A FEW QUESTIONS ONE. INKHEART IS FOR ALL PROGRAM DIRECTOR DR BURGESS JUST JUNE. DIRECTED AT GETTING LOWER INCOME FOLKS WE HAVE OLDER DURING YOUR VEHICLES IF THEY REPLACE WE GET INTO FOUR IN TERMS OF TAKING AN OLDER VERY VEHICLE OFF THE ROAD GETTING AND THEN I CALLED NICOLE THERE IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THE POINT THAT WE MADE ABOUT FARMER 80% OF FARMER MISDIRECTED THE VALUE TO GET INTO CLEANER TRACTORS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT. ALSO THE VALUES YOU WELL NO SUBSTANTIAL LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES COMMUNITY A COLOR HEAVY DUTY FOCUS ON CLEANER TRUCKS WAS CLEAN PRODUCTS PREDOMINANTLY OPERATE IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES I THINK IT'S OVER 70% SO THOSE REDUCTIONS OF DIESEL PM WHICH DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT THOSE COMMUNITIES. NETWORK WAREHOUSES RAIL YARDS IMPORTS RECEIVE A DISPROPORTIONATE BENEFIT FROM THOSE RCURSOS. PROGRAM THROUGH ACTIONS. HELLO RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CREATE DO HAVE THIS LOOK ABOUT THEIR REAL TO ABOUT MEMBERS OF BROUGHT UP- AND LET ME JUST A FOR TO THOSE MEMBERS SASS REMASTER QUESTIONS- SENATOR DOLLY I KNOW YOU HAD A QUESTION EARLIER. THAT I BELIEVE WAS MORE DIRECTED TOWARDS- THIS PANEL. I KNOW FIRST FIRST ARE LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT I I'M- SOMEBODY WHO'S I'M A FARMER BY THE WAY IN. THE END WE HAVE THE CARL MOYER PROGRAM WHICH WAS BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS VERY SUCCESSFUL I AGREE WITH YOU. THAT BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE A COMMENT FIRST THE VALLEY WERE. MISTER SALAS REPRESENTS HIS IS IN A BASIN WHERE IF YOU TOOK EVERY SINGLE PERSON OUT OF OUT OF THE COUNTY KERN COUNTY YOU WOULD STILL HAVE POLLUTION THERE BECAUSE IS TRANSPORTED. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR AND THAT THAT'S TRANSPORT FROM THE WESTERLY WINDS THAT COME FROM THE COAST AND WE JUST SAW. IN THE COMMENTS OF THE CHAIR MADE ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY SPENT. MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW BAY AREA FOLKS DRIVE A TESLA AND GET ENOUGH THAT IN THE IN THE CARPOOL LANE AT THE EXPERIENCE OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE GET. REALLY DISADVANTAGED PEOPLE IN DESERVES AND YOU'RE RIGHT THERE TO FOR IF YOU GET HIM OUT OF THE BAD CAR AND YOU GET HIM INTO A CAR THAT IS MORE AFFORDABLE IS GREAT BUT THERE'S CHARGING SYSTEMS THAT NEED TO BE AVAILABLE THERE'S THOSE THINGS BUT- BUT I WANT TO GET TO MY MAIN POINT MY MAIN POINT IS. I ASKED EARLIER WAS. AS AUDITORS REPORT NOTED ALSO. THE STATE'S ZAB GOALS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED BY EXECUTIVE ORDER. THE ORDER THE FIRST ORDER WAS WITH GOVERNOR BROWN ONE AND A HALF MILLION. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND FIVE MILLION BY TWENTY THIRTY. GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S EXECUTIVE ORDER DIRECTS THE ARB TO ACHIEVE A 100% ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE CYNDER LAIR CORRECTED ME AB THIRTY TWO WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX. FOURTEEN YEARS FORTY SIX FIFTEEN YEARS WHICH FOURTEEN YEARS TILL TWENTY THIRTY FIVE FIRST OF ALL THE FIRST QUESTION IS WHAT STATUTORY AUTHORITY WE'LL BE RELYING ON TO ADOPT REGULATIONS TO BAN THE SALES OF INTERNAL BUS DIDN'T IT COMBUSTION ENGINES BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AS THERE AS A DIRECT. AS DIRECTED IN GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION. YEAH LET ME- GO READ OUT THAT THE- WHAT WHAT WE WILL BE DOING IN IN HELPING UNDERSTAND REGULATION. SO THE DEREGULATION IS A MANUFACTURER A REQUIREMENT FOR PRODUCTION IT'S NOT A BAN OF THE USE AND OPERATION OF INDIAN USE. IC ENGINE BUT TO YOUR QUESTION AUTHORITY AB THIRTY TWO. STATE LAW FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT WE CAN'T GET TO THE HEALTH BASED AIR QUALITY STANDARDS THAT YOU TOUCHED ON IN THE VALLEY WITHOUT TRANSITION CLEANER TRANSPORTATION SO THOSE LAWS THAT FOCUS ON OZONE. AND TWO POINT FIVE TOXICS AND GHGS ALL HAVE A BEARING ON SUPPORTING A TRANSITION TO A CLEAN TRANSPORTATION MOST OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING BOTH THROUGH REGULATIONS AND INCENTIVES BECAUSE YOU ALL HAVE NOTED. WE NEED FAR MORE- I LIKELY INJUNCTION CARS WE HAVE TODAY. OKAY NOW MIGHT RIGHT I WANT TO MAKE ANOTHER COMMENT WHAT YOU WHAT YOU HEARD EARLIER YOU WERE ON I GUESS. YOUR EARLIER SO I REPRESENT THE FIRST SENATE DISTRICT WHICH IS TAHOE THE OREGON BORDER ALL THE WAY DOWN TO SACRAMENTO WHICH IS MOSTLY FORESTED IN OUR WATERSHEDS. WHICH HAS BEEN SPEWING OUT CARBON WE HAD FOUR POINT TWO MILLION ACRES LAST YEAR BURNED IN CALIFORNIA AND MANY MILLIONS THE YEARS PASSED SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE HAD BIGGEST FIRES IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. AND MORE DEVASTATION IN HOMES AND IT IMPACTED AND DEATHS. WHICH WE DON'T EVEN COUNT IN OUR CARBON OUTPUT. IT TO MEET THESE GOALS SO I KNOW THAT'S NOT YOUR DEPARTMENT I'M RUNNING A BILL THAT WILL REQUIRE YOU TO COUNT THAT HOPEFULLY WILL GET PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW. THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE WHICH IS SOMETHING I HOPE YOU CAN ANSWER AFTER READING THIS AUDIT REPORT AND THERE'S MANY MORE THINGS I COULD TALK ABOUT THERE'S JUST VERY FRUSTRATING I THINK. SENATOR BRADFORD. DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF ARTICULATING THE FRUSTRATION THAT I THAT THAT IS HAPPENING HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. BUT TO MEET THOSE TWENTY THIRTY FIVE GOALS. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT WE GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING BETTER THAN WHAT THIS AUDIT REPORT SAYS. AND WE'RE NOT GONNA BE HAVE THE ABILITY TO BUY. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE. THIS IS ANY FACTORS WON'T HAVE A NEW ONE I SHOULD SAY. AND WE'RE GONNA RELY ON. PRETTY SOON. THE COMBUSTIBLE. WILL OUT SOME POINT. AND WILL BE FORCED TO BUY ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE IN CALIFORNIA HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MEET THAT GOAL. RIGHT SO FIRST ELEMENTARY YOUR QUESTION RECOGNIZING THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CHALLENGE IT'S SIGNIFICANT THERE'S JUST NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET A SUGAR COAT IT'S- EASY. BUT YOU WILL GET THE FACT THAT. THE CURRENT PURCHASES TODAY ABOUT OF NEW VEHICLES THAT ARE ZERO ABOUT 8% IN THE TWO AND THE NUMBER OF MODELS IN VEHICLES AND AFFORDABILITY AND RANGE AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE PRODUCING VEHICLES IN THE STATE AND- PUTTING IN CHARGING STATIONS THE RAMP UP THE INCREASES ON PRESIDENT. BOTH THE PRODUCTION MANUFACTURING THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE STATE AND THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES SO REGULATION. IN CENTER PARTNERING WITH OTHER STATES PARTNERING WITH THE MANUFACTURERS I SUPPORT FOR CONTINUED INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL DOLLARS CONSUMER WORK CONSUMER EDUCATION EVERYONE OF THOSE ELEMENTS ARE GOING TO BE NECESSARY FOR THIS TRANSITION MOMENTS FUNDAMENTAL NOT JUST TO GHGS NIGHT REALLY WANT TO UNDERSCORE THIS POINT BECAUSE I THINK THAT TENDS TO BE THE FOCUS OF THESE CONVERSATIONS WHEN. THE FOCUS ON A BE ON REDUCING KNOX EMISSIONS TOXIC EMISSIONS WITH POLLUTANTS BASICALLY CONTRIBUTE TO OZONE AND PM TWO POINT FIVE THAT SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSE PUBLIC HEALTH. NOT UNDER THE SICK OF THE STATE THE CHALLENGE BUT THERE'S REAL RESULTS IN PROGRESS IN CALIFORNIA IS UNPRECEDENTED HOW IT'S MOVED FORWARD. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY- THIS CAR IF I COULD JUST ASK A CLARIFYING QUESTION TO MISTER DALI- COMING BECAUSE I THINK HE'S MISTER DALI AT MIGHT BE REFERRING TO WHAT I'M THINKING OF IS- PAGE THIRTY TWO THIRTY THREE OF THE AUDITOR'S REPORT. WHERE IT WAS REPORTED IN OUR BUDGET COMMITTEES THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO PAY OUT TWO POINT ONE MILLION- REBATES WHICH IS ROUGHLY ABOUT FIVE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. TO GET FIVE MILLION ORE IS THAT THIS. YOU KNOW ON THE ROAD JUST TO MEET THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. SO I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CARP COME UP WITH THE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS PUBLIC FUNDING TO ACHIEVE THAT IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE DATA THAT THE AUDITORS REPORT IS SAYING THAT. YOU'RE LACKING. NOT VALID THANK THEY YOU JERRY THIS WAS. STRAIGHT UP. IT WAS A QUESTION. THAT WE RESPONDED TO. WITH A FAIRLY SIGNATURE SIMPLISTIC. RESPONSE BASICALLY IT WAS. ASSUMING A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS AND THAT HARD TO SAY JAB SEEK STEVIE RP. AND IT WAS BASICALLY DURING. THE- DURING STRAIGHTFORWARD. IN UNDER- MARC AND HIS CHARACTER WAS FAIR DIGITAL WAY HE SAID THAT WE ARE RESPONDED TO THAT QUESTION SO THAT'S TO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THROUGH THE C. V. R. P. PROGRAM THAT'S CURRENTLY NOT FUNDED. SACRAMENTO YOU MAY THERE'S NOT AN APPROPRIATION IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET I THINK IS WHAT YOU KNOW THERE'S FUNDING FOR CTRP STILL BEING PAID OUT BUT IT'S CURRENTLY NOT THE BUDGET THAT'S A CORRECT STATEMENT AND I KNOW THAT YOU ALL ARE TALKING MINISTRATION AND FORMER FINANCE CORRECT YEAH AND YOU KNOW I'M JUST SAYING IF IT'S A PROGRAM THAT WORKS THEN WE SHOULD PROBABLY THE GOVERNOR PROBABLY SHOULD ADDED IN HIS INITIAL BUDGET BUT OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO TARGET THOSE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WITH THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF POLLUTION. SO I APPRECIATE THAT MR KOREAN AND I DIDN'T HEAR EXACTLY THE ANSWER TO SENATOR DOLLIES- FIRST QUESTION THOUGH WHICH WAS THE- THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO GO AHEAD AND ADOPT THE REGULATIONS FOR THE BANNING OF THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE WERE THAT AUTHORITY LIES ARE WHICH YOU ARE RELYING. YEAH THANK YOU TO ACTUALLY THOUGHT I DID RESPOND. FIRST THING I SAID WE DON'T BAN. ENGINES WHAT WE DO IS E TALK REGULATIONS. REQUIRING THAT MANUFACTURERS PRODUCE A PROGRESSIVELY. LEASING PERCENTAGE OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ARE VERY DIFFERENT THINGS. BUT IF YOUR QUESTION THEN IS WILL ON WHAT AUTHORITY. I STATE AUTHORITY TOXICS. CRITERIA POLLUTANTS THE AUTHORITY AB THIRTY CHANNEL FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT AUTHORITIES CHEAP ARE IMMUNE AIR QUALITY STANDARDS SO. I'M NOT AUTHORITY BOARD BOX HE'S DIESEL PM OR- AND ACTIVATE SHE'S ESTABLISHED AT BOTH THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL SO MULTIPLE CITATIONS THERE. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION IT DOES GET A LITTLE CONFUSING WHEN WE SEE PRESS RELEASES ISSUED BY. THE VERY SAID MINISTRATION AGENCIES AND FROM- THE DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT USE DIFFERENT LANGUAGE- WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO SENATOR GONZALEZ TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG AND I KNOW SOMEONE MEMBER GIPSON- STILL HAS THIS QUESTION FROM THE PREVIOUS PANEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MISTER COREY- EIGHT I THINK YOU'D MENTIONED IN THE VERY BEGINNING THAT YOU ARE TAKING ACTION ON SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND FINDINGS FROM THE AUDIT SO CAN YOU ELABORATE ON WHAT THOSE. ACTIONS ARE SO FAR I MEAN I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT IN HERE BUT- PLEASE CHECK SOME LIGHT ON THAT. YES THANK YOU WE TRY TO BREAK IT DOWN IN TERMS OF WANT WHERE THEIR OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SHORT RUN TO GET. BETTER QUALITY AND MORE COMPLETE DATA. I IN WHAT IS THE MECHANISM FOR DEALING. ONE IS THE SOLICITATIONS THAT WE GO THROUGH FOR A GRANT FROM INSTANCE. SO INCLUDING X. X. STRENGTHENING THAT EXPLICIT LANGUAGE. TO THE GRANT AGREEMENTS THAT WE HAVE WITH. ADMINISTRATORS OR ART RECIPIENTS. IN THREE THE DATA WE HAVE IN TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING ANALYSIS OF THOSE IN THE IMMEDIATE NEAR TERM THINGS THAT. JUMPED OUT AT US WHERE WE CAN. STRENGTHEN OUR THE ONE COLLECTION OF DATA INTO THAT THE- ANALYSIS OF DATA THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE. THERE CERTAINLY IS MORE AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF UPDATES IT WILL BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE AUDITOR. BUT THOSE ARE THE THOSE ARE THE- A FEW EXAMPLES. OF JUMPED OUT TO ME IMMEDIATELY. OKAY THANK YOU AND CAN YOU I'M A LITTLE BIT TO THE JOB TRAINING COMPONENT BECAUSE WE- HADN'T HEARD ABOUT IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL AND- IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THEY SOAK SOCIO ECONOMIC PROGRAMS AND BENEFITS. YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T REALLY HEARD MUCH OF WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE JOB TRAINING FRONT. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO ASK MY COLLEAGUE DR VIRGINS TO SPEAK TO. THANK THANK YOU SO MUCH A QUESTION- SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE JOBS QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY I THINK IT WAS MENTIONED THAT THE LEGISLATION START COLLECTING THAT DATA FOR ALL CARPENTRY FUNDED PROGRAMS INCLUDING ONES THAT CARP. THAT PASSED FIFTEEN IN TWENTY NINETEEN THERE WAS A TOOL WAS MADE AVAILABLE FOR ALL OF US WE STARTED USING THAT SO WE'VE STARTED USING THE TOOL WE LOOK FORWARD TO REPORTING MARC MORE JOB STATE AT OUR UPCOMING FUNDING PLAN. AND WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING INTERNALLY TO YOUR BEEF UP OUR SURVEYS WITH RESPECT TO HOW EXACTLY WE QUERY THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO OBTAIN THAT INFORMATION- I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT MAYBE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO CURRENTLY BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HELP OF COURSE UNDER SCORE THAT WILL BE MOVING FORWARD- AND DOING A MORE ROBUST JOB OF ENSURING THAT OUR GRANTEES COLLECT THAT DATA. SO LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION YOU KNOW LIKE ALL AGENCIES YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THAT WE'VE YOU KNOW APPLIED THE METHODOLOGY FOR HOW TO COLLECT THIS DATA APPROPRIATELY BUT WILL BE ABLE. TO BEEF IT UP AND WILL BE LOOKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE INCLUDED ALL OUR GRANT AGREEMENT SO WE CLICK JOBS DATA. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK CENTER GONZALEZ WILL MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG AND THEN TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON THE QUESTION TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM KERN COUNTY- IN TERMS OF THE CLEAN VEHICLE ASSISTANCE REBATE PROGRAM- WHICH PROVIDES- HAS YOU KNOW GRANTS AND AFFORDABLE FINANCING- SO TO HELP INCOME QUALIFY CALIFORNIANS. PURCHASE NEW OR USED HYBRID AND DEATHS RIGHT. SO JUST SO I'M CLEAR R. ALL SENDS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE GRANTS UNDER THIS PROGRAM. I'M GONNA ASK OUR DOCTOR BURGESS CHICKEN RESPOND IT'S A PROGRAM SHALL HAVE MORE DETAIL ON. RIGHT SO THROUGH THE STATE RIGHT FINANCING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM- THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT VEHICLES THAT ARE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE EVERYTHING FROM HUNDRED TO PLUG IN VEHICLES- AGAIN I'VE HEARD THIS CHARACTERIZED AS A LITTLE PROGRAM I DO WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT THIS IS REALLY A LOAN LOSS PROGRAM SO WE LOOK TO. PARTNER WITH BANKS- TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE BACKING THAT'S NEEDED TO PROVIDE COMPETITIVE RATES TO FOLKS WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT OTHERWISE. SO THEN- SO ARE YOU I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE AND I GUESS MAYBE YOU CAN JUST CLICK BY SO. WHEN I LOOKED UP AT THE WEBSITE THE CLEAN VEHICLE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WEBSITE. AS OF AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY THERE WAS SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRANTS. FOR A TOTAL OF THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN SPENDING AND THEN. LAST WEEK AS OF JANUARY OR AS OF JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE I GUESS MAYBE THAT'S THE MOST RECENT- ON THE WEBSITE. IT WAS ONE THOUSAND SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT GRANTS FOR A TOTAL OF EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION. DOLLARS AND I'M SURE THERE'S AND IF YOURS ARE THEIRS AT THAT THOUSANDS OF OTHER ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS PENDING WITH SO I GUESS THAT NUMBER COULD BE. MAYBE TEN MILLION DOLLARS AS OF TODAY ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT SURGE OF. APPLICATIONS YES THIS IS. A VERY POPULAR PROGRAM AND WE'VE EXPERIENCED A SURGE BEFORE- AND SO YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED. WILL BYERS HAVE RECEIVED LOANS- AND NOT NOT TO BREAK THE NEWS EARLY BUT WE WILL BE GOING INTO A RESERVATION MODE- FOR THIS PROGRAM- SHORTLY SO THEN WHAT IS THE INCOME ELIGIBILITY. OF THE NETWORK SO ALL OF THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE OF THESE GRANTS- DO YOU KNOW THE- THE AVERAGE INCOME OF THOSE APPLYING. THE AVERAGE INCOME OF PARTICIPANTS IS- THIRTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS WITH AN AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD SIZE OF JUST OVER TWO PEOPLE. BUT IF YOU'RE A FAMILY OF FOUR WHAT'S IT DID THAT THAT INCOME LIMIT WE GO UP TO LIKE A HUNDRED FOUR THOUSAND. IS THAT CORRECT. IS MY INTERPRETATION CORRECT. I'M SO SORRY I WOULD NEED TO DOUBLE CHECK THAT AND GET BACK TO YOU SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WAS THAT THERE WAS A CHANGE WITH THAT INCREASE THE INCOME LIMIT. 64100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL SO THAT IF SOMEONE OF THOSE IF THERE WAS A FAMILY OF FOUR ON THE WEBSITE IT SAID THAT YOUR AND YOUR INCOME ELIGIBILITY PRETTY HARD FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. IS THE IS THE WEBSITE CORRECT. RIGHT FOR HIM YES THE 4100% OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IS CORRECT- AND I DID AFTER I WAS GIVING YOU PREVIOUSLY BASED ON ACTUAL APPLICANTS SO THE IN TERMS OF OUR ACTUAL PARTICIPANTS THE AVERAGE INCOME. IS THIRTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND YES- YOU ARE CAPPED AT 4100% OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL FOR PARTICIPATION OKAY AND WITH THAT BORDER PERCENT WAS THAT THE RECENT CHANGE WAS ALWAYS THERE. IN THE PROGRAM. WITH THE INCOME LIMIT INCREASE WAS THAT ALWAYS AT THEIR HOME WAS THAT CHANGED RECENTLY. YOU DON'T NEED TO DOUBLE CHECK THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU. YOU DON'T KNOW IF THE PROGRAM CHANGED OR NOT. YOU KNOW THE PROGRAM RECENTLY REOPENED AS I MENTIONED WE EXPERIENCED A SURGE PREVIOUSLY. AND SO IN THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE REOPENED THE PROGRAM TO DO STATEWIDE- BUT IT IS ALWAYS BEST FOR HER PERCENT OR FINANCING ASSISTANCE. OKAY I GUESS IT MIGHT BE MY CONCERN IS. A WHAT DO YOU HAVE SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE APPLYING FOR LOANS AND REBATES THAT THEY ARE INDEED. YOU KNOW LOW INCOME. YES GREAT QUESTION SO YES WE DO WE DO HAVE THE STATE PLACE WE DO PARTNER WITH OUR GRANTEES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING CHECKS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. AT AND THIS IS TRUE ACROSS ACROSS OUR PROGRAMS. FINANCING ASSISTANCE OR OTHERWISE. YOU COULD YOU COULD YOU OUTLINE WHAT THOSE SAFEGUARDS WOULD BE OR WHAT THEY ARE. I'M HAPPY TO LOOK INTO TO THAT THE SPECIFIC DOCUMENTATION THAT WE ASK OF OUR PARTICIPANTS. OKAY I MEAN THIS IS CERTAINLY A CONCERN RIGHT GIVES ONE SENATOR BRADFORD WAS OUTLINING IS THAT YOU KNOW MATTHEW PRETTY BASIC QUESTIONS AND I GUESS. YOU KNOW. I DON'T WANT WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ELIGIBLE AND WE WANT RIGHT PEOPLE TO BE UTILITIES I HAVE PROGRAM AND- YOU DON'T SEEM TO KNOW WHAT'S IT GOING TO HAVE TO ENSURE THAT. THERE'S NO FRAUD AND ABUSE IN THE PROGRAM- AND I ONLY SAY THAT AND I GOES YEAH IT'S LEADING UP TO THIS QUESTION WHICH IS. YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE SEEN SOME ONLINE COMMENTS IN AND SOME OF THE WEBSITES THAT INDICATED THAT. WEALTHY CUSTOMERS ARE ACCESSING THE PROGRAM. AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT. BE CONCERNED BY THOSE REPORTS BUT AGAIN WE DO ELIGIBLE ELIGIBILITY CHECKS BUT- IF THERE'S SPECIFIC CONCERNS THAT THIS IS BEING GAME SOMEHOW I'M HAPPY TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION WITH YOU IN YOUR OFFICE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN. OKAY- YOU KNOW IT THAT AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING ABOUT WHERE I THINK I JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHTED THIS IS A TRANSPARENCY ISSUE RIGHT I THINK IT I WANT I WANT TO QUOTE MR LAWRIE WHICH AT THAT. HE HE HE ANSWERED MISTER BRADFORD BY SAYING THAT EVERY DOLLAR. SPENT HARD IN THESE PROGRAMS ARE WELL DOCUMENTED. AND WELL RECORDED. SELL IF IT IS WELL DOCUMENTED AND WELL REPORT THEN THERE BETTER NOT BE ANY FRAUD OR ABUSE IN THIS PROGRAM- AND YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE ALSO SEEN ON ON COMMENT BOARDS AND ON ONLINE MESSAGE BOARDS THAT. INDIVIDUALS ARE PERMITTING THEM TO HUNT TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR HOME CHARGER CREDIT YOU'RE USING THEIR TARGET CREDIT. BUYING CHARGERS AND PORTABLE CHARGERS. AND THEN SELLING THEM ON EBAY. THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT ALLOWED IN THE PROGRAM IN THE SAN. AGAIN I'M HAPPY TO LOOK INTO THESE ALLEGATIONS I MEAN YOU'RE YOU'RE BRINGING UP SOME THINGS. VERY CONCERNING AND SOME INTERESTED IN LOOKING INTO THAT YEAH I DO WANT TO UNDERSCORE AT THE WAY THE FINANCING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WORKS AS WE GO THROUGH THE PRE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR EVERYONE WHO PARTICIPATES IN THE PROGRAM. WE LOOK AT THEIR INCOME TAX DATA AND THEN APPROVED. TO PARTICIPATE SO IF THAT IS NOT OCCURRING IN THE WAY THAT I LINED OUT OR YOU'RE AWARE OF SOME SOME GAMING I. WOULD WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. OKAY I MASS DON'T WANT NOT BUT IT SOUNDS TO ME THAT- OKAY MAYBE SOME LOOPHOLES AND THERE MAY BE SOME SAID CAR CHALLENGES- AND THIS IS VERY DISCONCERTING THAT- YEAH YOU'RE NOT. OUTLINING THE SAFEGUARDS OR THE SYSTEM OF THE STATE OF SAFEGUARDS IN HAND NO PROBLEM YOU'RE TOUTING. AS SUCCESSFUL- SO THAT'S THAT'S VERY TROUBLING TO ME. THANK YOU MISTER PUBLIC I MAY BE A LITTLE BIT- NERVOUS BUT I GUESS THE THING THAT I'M TRYING. TO DO MY BEST UNDER SCORE IS THE HIGHEST WHICH WE DO PRE APPROVE EVERY APPLICATION WE DO CHECK AND COME TAX RETURNS. AND WORK TO PRE APPROVAL. OR THEY ATE IN THE FINANCING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY PROOF OF GAMING SYSTEM BUT AGAIN WAYS OPEN TO A CONVERSATION. YEAH AND I AM NOT LOOKING AT ME I DO INTEND TO PUT ON THE SPOT AND AS AND OTHER PEOPLE ON ON- AND CAR BUT- I THINK THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AS WE- DISCUSSED. I MEAN IF THERE IS A DISCUSSION WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE OF PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO THIS PROGRAM- I THINK WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THESE THEM CHALLENGES CAN I ASK HOW HOW MUCH IS LEFT IN THE CLEAN VEHICLE.. I'M LEFT THIS TO BE. SINCE SIR. I GUESS BROKE AS I AM. WHERE ARE ABOUT TO RUN OUT OF MONEY AND ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE'RE ENTERING INTO TO A RESOLUTION. SOME OF THE MENTIONED THERE HAS BEEN A SEARCH ON THE PROGRAM. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE THE KEY MARKET. SO THAT THE PROGRAM IS STEPS OUT RAPIDLY. RAPIDLY RUNNING OUT OF RESOURCE. SO HOW MUCH WOULD BE SPENT WHOLE PROGRAM. HOW MUCH IS THAT THE HOW AND HOW MUCH WAS A YOU GUYS ANTICIPATING SPENDING BECAUSE I AM GOING BACK TO WHAT THE CHARITY INDICATED GIVE. ME WHAT IS IT WHAT THE NUMBERS AND- TWENTY ONE LESS LESS THAN COUNTY AND HE AND I REPRESENT THE SAME AREAS SO- WE CERTAINLY ARE NOT VERY SENSITIVE TO THE FACT IS IF. IF THIS PROGRAM IS NOT TECHNICALLY WORKING. WITHOUT WORKING AND CRANK OUT. SO YOU CAN PROVIDE ME THE INFORMATION I. APPRECIATE IT THANK MISTER. THANK YOU MR FONG- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ASSEMBLY GIPSON WHO IS PARTICIPATING REMOTELY LET ME ASK THERE'S ADDITIONAL MEMBERS. THAT HAVE QUESTIONS PARTICIPATING REMOTELY IF THEY CAN JUST. SEND ME A QUICK MESSAGE TAX. WOOD THE MOST EFFICIENT AND SO WILL MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADJOURNMENTS SALAS- ICE I WOULD ABSOLUTELY LIKE TO GET A RESPONSE TO A SIMILAR FARMS QUESTION REGARDING HOW MUCH MONEY IS LEFT IN THE PROGRAM- I WOULD THINK THAT YOU APPEAR BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE- THIS QUESTION WILL BE GREATLY ANTICIPATED. AS PART OF YOUR PRESENTATION SO CAN YOU PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION CALL SOMEBODY AND FIND OUT THERE'SNO FOR YOU ON THIS LINE THAT SOMEBODY SHOULD BE TEXAN SOMEBODY A RESPONSE TO MEMBER FONG'S QUESTION THAT I AM ABSOLUTELY CURIOUS TO HEAR A RESPONSE TO. SO IT'S POSSIBLE I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING THE QUESTION BUT THERE'S BEEN ABOUT FOURTEEN WHICH COMPANIES HOW MUCH MONEY IS LEFT IN THE PROGRAM. IT SHOULD LET ME TRY AND TAKE IT STANDS I THINK I AM TRACKING THE QUESTION BECAUSE THERE'S THREE PROGRAMS THEY WERE TALK ABOUT DIFFERENTLY. I WITH RESPECT TO C. B. R. NG IT'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION LEFT. WITH RESPECT. WITH RESPECT TO LOW INCOME C. B. R. P. WE JUST MOVED IT'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION SO BOTH OF THOSE ARE ABOUT I AM IN THE BALLPARK DID YOU CAN CORRECT ME BUT I THINK THAT WAS THE QUESTION IS ONE OF THE REMAINING DOLLARS IN THOSE TWO PROGRAMS AND THAT THOSE ARE APPROXIMATE AND I WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THE PRECISE NUMBERS BUT THOSE ARE. THOSE ARE PROXIMATE ON THE SPOT RESPONSES IT SHOULD BE CORRECT. AS I UNDERSTAND SYDNEY INDICATED THAT- YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO INTO RESERVE MOLD OR- BECAUSE THIS MONEY TO GET READY TO RUN OUT WAS THAT CORRECT. I DON'T THIS DINNER CHECKED VERY QUICKLY I HAD THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE STATEWIDE FINANCING SYSTEMS PROGRAM WHICH IS ABOUT TO GO ON A RESERVATION MODE AND WE ONLY HAVE ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS LEFT THEIR HEADS THE RESERVATION MODE. MISTER COREY YOU MENTIONED HOW MUCH WE HAVE LEFT REMAINING IN THE C. B. R. P. POT- IF THERE IS OTHER PROGRAMS ON THE TABLE THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN DOLLAR AMOUNTS I'M HAPPY TO CHIME IN THERE BUT APOLOGIES IF COST CONFUSION. GRIPS MOVING ON UP I WOULD ALLOW MY COMMENTS WERE- SENATOR BRAD BURKE- I JUST FEEL ABSOLUTELY SINCE I'VE BEEN ELECTED. OUR CAR HAVE I BELIEVE IN MY OPINION AND MY OPINION HAS TOTALLY DISRESPECT THIS LEGISLATURE. IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE A BAD TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO. IT RESPECT OF THIS LEGISLATURE- FOR THAT FOR THAT REASON LET ME POSE THIS QUESTION. BUT THOSE PROGRAMS WHICH ARE INTENDED FOR SOCIAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS. AUDIT FINDS THAT IT WOULD ACCEPT. IT WOULD EXPECT CARD TO DEMONSTRATE. PROGRAM VALUED BY CLEARLY DEFINING. AND MEASURING SOCIAL ECONOMIC. BENEFITS IT SOUNDS LIKE. CAR HAS MANY. OF TOOLS OF. BUT SUCH AS THE CLEAN THE CLEAN CAR FOR ALL SURVEY BUT IT FAILED TO REQUIRES IT. Y QUESTION TO MR COREY CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY CAR HAS FAILED IN ITS STATUTORY OBLIGATION. SEVEN LET ME OUR FIRST MAKE AN IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE YOUR YOUR FOCUS IS RIGHTLY SO ON SOCIAL. CANONIC SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO CLEAN TRUCKS WITH RESPECT TO CLEAN CARS FOR ALL THOSE VEHICLES ARE OPERATING IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THE COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE THEY'RE SAYING THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE AND UP AND DOWN THE STATE ON EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IS CONCERNEDABOUT DIRTY TRUCKS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THESE DOLLARS SUBSTANTIAL ARE CLEANING UP TRUCKS NOT ENOUGH DOLLARS BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF TRUCKS CLICK GETTING CLEANER TRUCKS ON THE ROAD REDUCING DIESEL PM A CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM YOU GET TALKING IT CALLED OUT DIRECTED AT LOW INCOME FOLKS GETTING AND THEN MUCH CLEANER. LOWER EMITTING VEHICLES NOW WITH RESPECT TO YOUR JOBS QUESTION IT WAS A FAIR CRITICISM ARE WE COLLECTING DATA FROM CONSUMERS THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM ABOUT THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS IN ADDITION TO THE CALL CLEAN CAR THAT THEY GOT. AYE THAT'S CHALLENGING AND MY POINT IS EITHER GOOD KNOWLEDGE IT STRAIGHT UP GETTING THAT DATA IT WAS NOT COMPLETE WE NEED TO GET IT. AND SOME CONSUMERS MAY BE. NOT AS WELL TO SHOW IT BECAUSE IT ARE PERSONAL AND FOR. RELATED ISSUES BUT- YOU KNOW I AM COMMITTED TO FOLLOW UP AND BASICALLY HAVE SURVEYS THAT ASKED THAT DATE YOU KNOW SO IT'S NOT ABOUT THE CLEANER VEHICLES YOU'RE GETTING. IT'S ABOUT JUST GETTING THE CLEANER VEHICLE CREATE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES JOBS AND SO ONE THAT THAT THAT DATA IS MUCH MORE CHALLENGING TO GET OUT AND WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON. OKAY WHAT MISTER CHAIR IF I MAY FOLLOW UP JUST ONE LAST QUESTION. GET ARE GIVEN ARAFAT THE AUDIT'S FINDINGS ARE JUST FINE- THE FACT THAT THIS BODY IS IN THE PROCESS OF A DAY OF ADOPTING SOME CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURES THEY ARE EARLY ACTION. HOW CAN HOW CAN THE LEGISLATURE JUSTIFY EXPANDING. TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BEFORE THE AUDITORS RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ADOPTED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. CLEARLY ALTAMONT APPROPRIATIONS IN EUROPE IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S COURT BUT I WOULD MAKE THIS OBSERVATION AND I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE. I CALIFORNIA HAS THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND HAS MADE ENORMOUS PROGRESS UNDENIABLE PROGRESS IN IT AS THE POPULATION INCREASED THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES AND SO FORTH. PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD COME HERE TO SEE HOW WE'RE DOING IN ADDITION TO THOSE IMPROVEMENTS AND WE STILL HAVE AREAS WITH THAT HOW. MUCH MORE IMPROVEMENT. CALIFORNIA IS A MAGNET. FOR CLEAN CAR- MANUFACTURES ZERO MISSION ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS ZERO MOTION. FORKLIFTS ZERO EMISSION BUSES. IT IS A DIRECT RESPONSE FROM THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LEGISLATURE IN ITS COMMITMENT TO CLEAN AIR AND THE FACT THAT IS SUPPORTING PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE SERVING AS A MAGNET FOR MANUFACTURING AND JOBS COME TO CALIFORNIA YOU DON'T HAVE TO BELIEVE ME LOOK AT THE I. L. A. R. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION AND OTHER ECONOMIC OUTFITS THAT LOOK AT THIS DATA INDEPENDENTLY AND SAY THE SAME THING. I'D HURRY UP. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU BELIEVE THAT CONCLUDES THAT YOU'RE QUESTIONING MISTER GIBSON. YES RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA RETURN IT BACK TO YOU- MEMBERS ON THE DIETS I JUST HAD. TWO QUICK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS- ONE THAT WAS RAISED EARLIER ABOUT. THE ACCOUNTABILITY A LOT OF THIS IS STEMMING FROM THE LACK OF DATA THAT WAS OUTLINED IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT NEEDING SOME OF THE STATE IT WAS INDICATED. THAT THAT CAR HAS THE FUNDING THE AUTHORITY AND SOME OF THESE THIRD PARTY CONTRACTS- TO TRACK THE EFFICACY OF SOME OF THE PROGRAMS WERE DISCUSSING TODAY- BUT- I JUST WANTED TO GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE MISTER COREY- WHY ISN'T THE DATA AVAILABLE IF. YOU GUYS ARE CONTRACTING WITH INDIVIDUALS TO PROVIDE THIS DATA. WELL THANK GOODNESS FOLLOW UP IS WHAT DATA ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE LET ME BE CRYSTAL CLEAR ON THIS DATA ON THE VEHICLES THAT ARE BEING FUNDED. WHETHER THEY'RE NEW OR USED CLEANER VEHICLES THE DATA OUT WHERE THOSE VEHICLES ARE GOING. THE TOTAL AT YOU BENEFITS AND MISSION REDUCTIONS OVERLY OVERALL PROGRAM IT'LL DAY THAT'S COLLECTED SO AND RECORD AND OUR MISSION INVENTORY I THINK THE REAL QUESTION THAT REALLY GOT TO THE HEART OF THIS IS SOME OF THE HARDER GAME. TO COLLECT QUALITY DATA INTO A COMPREHENSIVE WAY HI MY BIRDS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL. I DETERMINING THAT LOW INCOME INDIVIDUAL DIDN'T CREATE NEW JOB OPPORTUNITIES TO THEIR CREDIT SCORE INCREASE. THAT'S THE KIND OF DATA THAT WE DON'T HAVE AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TRY AND GET IT AND HONESTLY WE MAY NOT BE THE BEST AGENCIES CORRECT MAYBE WORKFORCE AND LABOR DEVELOPMENTS SOME OF THAT LEGISLATORS POSE THAT QUESTION. WE'RE GOING TO HELP ON THAT AND I'VE REACHED OUT TO SOME LEGISLATORS AND OTHERS REALLY EXPLORING HOW CAN WE FULLY BE RESPONSIBILITY AUDITORS QUESTION. QUESTIONS ARE DO IT AN INEFFECTIVE IN MEANINGFUL WAY AND DO IN AN AREA WHERE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT EXPERTISE. JOB CREATION THAT'S WATER ARE VERY OF EXPLOITATION THERE CERTAINLY ARE PEOPLE MAKE CAREERS OUT OF THIS THERE WERE WHERE THEY WERE. ALREADY TALKING TO WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME HELP. GOT IT NINE. THAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE AT THE END OF DAY WERE JUST TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING THEM BANG FOR THE BUCK A FOR TRYING COLLECT THIS. TO EFFECTUATE CHANGE IN SOME OF THESE MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES MOST. POLLUTED COMMUNITIES AND OBVIOUSLY THE DATA ABSTRACT THE POLICY OF THE FUNDING. TO GET THE GOALS THE CLIMATE GOALS AND REALLY THE- HOPEFULLY THE POSITIVE HEALTH ASPECTS WE CAN HAVE IN SOME OF THESE MOST. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- SO YOU KNOW I THINK THE END OF THE DAY A LOT OF US ARE LOOKING FOR YOU KNOW ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE EQUITY FOR THESE A LOT OF TIME IN NON ATTAINMENT. HIGHLY POLLUTED COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE. LET ME JUST ASK ONE FINAL QUESTION- AND THAT'S JUST OF THE AUDIT THE AUDIT MADE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS I BELIEVE AROUND FOURTEEN. AND I JUST WANTED TO ASK- ARE YOU PLANNING ON IMPLEMENTING ALL OF THOSE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA DO THE CHECK INS WITH THE AUDITOR COMES BACK AND CHECKS IN ON THE PROGRESS WELL THE RECOMMENDATIONS OUTLINED IN THE AUDITED WHAT STEPS HAVE YOU TAKEN TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND WERE YOU PLANNING ON IMPLEMENTING ALL OF THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS.

THE YEAR% WALKING STRONGER THAN THAT AND WE'RE ALREADY REACHING OUT TO OTHERS OTHER EXPERTS HOW CAN WE BE FULLY RESPONSIVE THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS. AND DO IN A WAY THAT HONESTLY. THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I TALKED ABOUT WHICH INCLUDE HOW DO YOU DISENTANGLE. WHAT MOTIVATES A CONSUMER TO MAKE A DECISION WHEN THERE'S MULTIPLE. PROGRAMS INTERACT THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE WHETHER WE'RE GETTING A NEW CAR AND WE'RE GETTING REDUCTIONS IT'S HOW ARE YOU ATTRIBUTING THOSE BENEFITS. THAT'S COMPLEX. ECONOMIC BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOME HELP TO BREAK IT DOWN AND WORK THROUGH IT. YEAH WE UNDERSTAND THOSE CHALLENGES THANK YOU MISTER KOREA THE CAB FROM SOME OF THE MEMBERS QUESTIONING THOSE THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PROGRAMS WERE- BENEFITING INDIVIDUALS AND LOWER. SOCIAL ECONOMIC SITUATIONS. AND I KNOW SOME OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BROUGHT UP ON INCOMES OVER A HUNDRED YOU KNOW SIX FIGURES. AND THEY SEEM TO BE SKEWED TOWARDS. HELPING THOSE INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGHER INCOMES AS OPPOSED TO LOWER INCOMES. SO WE'RE GONNA LOOK VERY EAGERLY EAGERLY AT THE NEXT UPCOMING REPORTS BUT JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND THAT. THE NUMBER OF THE LEGISLATORS THAT YOU HEARD HERE TODAY ARE LOOKING AT THOSE THAT LOW SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND HOW THE PROGRAMS ARE BENEFITING THE INTENDED PLACES. YOU KNOW I BROUGHT UP THE EXAMPLE OF 80% EARLIER BEING SPENT OUTSIDE OF THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY BUT- THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS I THINK I KEEP CONTINUE TO HEAR FROM. SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE. I WITH THAT LET ME ASK YOU HAVE ANY. REMARKS I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANY MORE QUESTIONS.

ALEXANDER ON BEHALF OF CAL START YOUR MEMBER BASED NONPROFIT. AND ALSO PROPOSED DISCLOSURE WE ARE THE ADMINISTRATOR- THE H. THAT HEAVY DUTY THAT YOUR INCENTIVE PROGRAM I RESIDE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY BUT WE ARE HEADQUARTERED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY- THANK YOU HEARD A LOT ABOUT EASIER P. ANY CARD EQUITY PROGRAMS WHICH ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO HELP START- BUT WE DID WANT TO SPEAK A BIT MORE ABOUT THE HEAVY DUTY PROGRAMS WHICH ARE ALSO DISCUSSED IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT. AND HEALTHCARE ADVOCATE FOR ECOSYSTEM APPROACH TO DECARBONIZING TRANSPORTATION AND WE REALLY EMPHASIZED ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD. I NEED FRANKLIN HAS BETTER ALSO PAIRED WITH REGULATION AND THAT GIVING DIRECTION TO MANUFACTURERS AND FLEETS I'M WE FIND THE AUDITORS RECORD IN SOME CASES EARLY MISSTATES THE CAUSE AND EFFECT FOR MEDIUM AND. HEAVY DUTY THAT PURCHASES. I HERE MISSION VIA PURCHASE AND ALSO. MAJOR AIR ECONOMIC BENEFIT. OF CLEAN VEHICLE FOR. I AM SURE HOPE THERE ON THE LINE YOU'LL HEAR FOR ANOTHER. LIKE DAN WHO PURCHASED VEHICLES BUT THE ASSISTANCE BUT H. THAT. AS WELL AS MANUFACTURING BRINGING VERY ADVANCED VEHICLE TO MARKET THANK YOU I'M FAIR. THANK YOU THANK YOU RIGHT NEXT BUBBLE COMMONPLACE. MAXIMO TO LINE TWENTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD- GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS CHRIS LOWELL CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION- WANTED TO RESPOND AS ONE PART OF THE AUDIT- REGARDING WHETHER ZERO EMISSION OF COMMERCIAL TRUCKS WOULDN'T FOCUS IN THE ABSENCE OF INCENTIVES I'M AS YOU MAY KNOW- CARB EARLY PROPOSES TO ACQUIRE NEARLY ALL COMMERCIAL TRUCKS IN CALIFORNIA. ZERO EMISSION BY TWENTY FORTY. GIVEN THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF TRUCKING COMPANIES OR SMALL BUSINESSES AND GIVEN THAT YOUR MISSION TRUCKS ARE TYPICALLY TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A TRADITIONAL DIESEL. INCENTIVES TO BUY DOWN VEHICLE AND CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE COST A CRUCIAL PART OF THE SPEECH STRATEGY. THE BOYS ARE MISSION TRUCKS. COMMERCIAL TRUCKS ARE VERY DIFFERENT THAN CARS AS ARE THE DECISION TO GO INTO WHAT TECHNOLOGY PURCHASE. COMMERCIAL TRUCKS MUST MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE FOR THEIR OPERATORS AND INCENTIVES ARE A CRUCIAL PART OF MAKING THE BOTTOM LINE WORK. WE SUPPORT THE ARTISTS CALL FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY BUT ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE NEED OVERALL. FOR SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INCENTIVES UP TO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS MORE TAXES FOR CALIFORNIA TRUCKERS IN THIS EFFORT I COULD QUITE YOUR MISSION TRUCKS THANK YOU. THANK. YOU OUR NEXT PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE. MAXIMO LOCAL THIRTY PLEASE BY. GOOD EVENING BACKGROUND ON THE AFTER THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL CALIFORNIA I WANTED TO BRIEFLY EXPRESSED YOUR DISMAY REGARDING SOME OF THE FINDINGS FROM AUDIT. PARTICULARLY AROUND THE BOARD STANDARD EVALUATE THIS ACCIDENTS PROGRAMS ON REQUIRED JOB CREATION AND TRAINING. AS YOU KNOW BECAUSE PRESIDENTS HAVE DRAMATIC IMPACTS ON THE LIVELIHOOD OF OUR MEMBERS AS WELL AS FOR OTHER INDUSTRIAL TRANSPORTATION SECTOR UNION STREET WHICH REASON IT'S PARTICULARLY TROUBLING TO READ DESPITE CLEAR DIRECTION MANDATES REQUIRING JOB DATA REPORTING CARD WAS ONLY KEEPING AFTER A SMALL FRACTION OF THE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS- LIKE WHY CAN COLLEGES DOES INCLUDE JOB TRAINING AS A PROGRAM BENEFITS DOES NOT ALWAYS REQUIRE ITS PROGRAM MINISTERS TO PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRAINING. OR HOW IT BENEFITS PARTICIPANTS GIVEN THE NUMEROUS WAY CARD PROGRAMS IMPACTOR MEMBERS JOBS THE BOARD BEEN DIFFERENCE TO JOB CREATION TRAINING IS CERTAINLY TROUBLING WE WOULD ASK THE BOARD WERE TO NEARLY REMEDY THESE INADEQUACIES. MEANING FOREIGN THANK YOU. THANK YOU PUBLIC COMMON PLEASE. AXOLOTL LINE SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK THIS IS WITH GAVIN THE COAL FOR CLEAN AIR WE SPONSORED THE BILL THAT REQUIRES INVESTMENTS IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO THIS TOPIC IS OF GREAT INTEREST TO US AND WE AGREE WITH THE AUDITORS THAT WE NEED MORE DATA PARTICULARLY ON IMPACTS ON CONSUMER BEHAVIOR ON QUANTIFYING SOCIAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS LIKE JOBS AND- DEMONSTRATING BENEFITS THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WHILE THIS ANALYSIS GOES FORWARD WE SHOULD NOT HAVE PARALYSIS OF ANALYSIS AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BENEFITING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES GERMAN SALAS YOU HAVE BEEN A BIG SUPPORTER OF CLEAN CARS FOR ALL WHICH IS PROVIDING CLEAN SAFE MOBILITY FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IN YOUR DISTRICT AND OTHER DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PROGRAMS LIKE THAT. ARE CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED. SECONDLY WE ARE. ABOUT FALLING SHORT OF OUR EMISSION REDUCTION NEEDS FOR AIR QUALITY AND GREENHOUSE GASES SO WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO DO MORE TO REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM OIL REFINERIES. AND TO REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. AND FINALLY- IT'S A MYSTERY TO ME WHY THIS AUDIT IS SO FOCUSED ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND SO LITTLE ON AIR QUALITY AND PUBLIC HEALTH. MANY OF YOU MEMBERS HAVE TALKED ABOUT YOUR CONCERN WITH AIR POLLUTION BUT YOU DIDN'T ASK THE AUDITOR TO ADDRESS THAT AND THAT'S A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT TO US THANK YOU. THANK YOU OUR NEXT PUBLIC COMMENT PLACE. ZACKS ABOVE ALL TRYING SEVENTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. A GOOD AFTERNOON DANIEL BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF CARE CLUB CALIFORNIA THE OTHER RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DO A LOT MORE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR EVER EVER GOING TO MEET OUR GOALS AND FLOW THE CLIMATE CRISIS. HE EVEN THOUGH THE AUDIT FOCUSED ON GHG IT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE NEED TO GET FATO FUEL COMBUSTION ENGINE OFF THE ROAD FOR EVER GOING TO GET CLEAN UP. THE STATE SENATORIAL AIR POLLUTION. EXPECTING SINGLE AGING TO STOP CRISIS THE ON REALIZE. THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO DO TAKE MORE AGGRESSIVE ACTION TO OUR PLATE POLLUTING. FOSSIL FUEL VEHICLES. WITH ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. THE LEGISLATURE MEANT TAKE BOLD ACTION SUCH AS SUPPORTING THE GOVERNOR'S CLEAN TRANSPORTATION BUDGET PROPOSAL AND CANNOT AFFORD TO SUPPORT HALF MEASURES. MIKESELL CALLED THE NEAR DEIR AL VEHICLES. ALL STATE AGENCIES AND THE LEGISLATURE MUST DO MORE TO PROTECT OUR PLANET. AND COMMUNITIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE. MAX HELLO CAROLINE THIRTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FOR THE CHANCE JIM CATHOLICS FOUNDER AND CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER AT MOTIV POWER SYSTEMS STARTED ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO WE'VE GROWN TO OF IMPLYING ABOUT A HUNDRED PEOPLE MOST IN CALIFORNIA. RUNNING TO SMALL MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND- HERE IN STOCKTON WE PROVIDE ALL ELECTRIC TRUCKS AND BUSES THAT I LIKE TO SAY WE FREE FLEETS FROM FOSSIL FUEL BUT WE DON'T DO IT ALONE WE RELY HEAVILY ON CARDS A TRICKY PROGRAM I THINK TRUCK AND BUS ORDERS WOULDN'T HAPPEN WITHOUT H. THAT. CUSTOMERS WOULD BUY GASOLINE AND DIESEL- ONE EXAMPLE THE BAKERY IN ALAMEDA WHO SEEING INCREASED DEMAND DURING COBIT THEY WANT TO GO ELECTRIC BUT THEY'RE ONLY. ABLE TO CONSIDERED BECAUSE THE NATURE. AND ARE NINE ELECTRIC. FOR THE COMMUNITY RESOURCE PROJECT IN SACRAMENTO THEY'RE DEPLOYED PROVIDING HOME ENERGY AUDITS WEATHER WEATHERIZATION AND H. BACK SERVICES. TO LOW INCOME RESIDENTS IN THE AREA. OF BY SACRAMENTO. AND THAT ARE SOME OF THE WORST IN THE COUNTRY AND THEN. EMAIL BAKERIES LARGEST BAKERY IN THE WORLD THERE NOW ROLLING OUT ELECTRIC DELIVERY TRUCKS TARGETING A HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED PER YEAR BASED ON THE SUCCESS OF TWENTY FIVE ELECTRIC TRUCKS. THAT THEY BOUGHT ONLY DUE TO A TRIP. WITHOUT THAT THOSE WOULD BE GASOLINE AND THE NEXT ONE COULD ALSO BE GASOLINE. MOST OF OUR CUSTOMERS DOMICILE THEIR VEHICLES IN MARIN URBAN AREAS TO THE IMPACT. AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT HAS BEEN- YEAH. LARGE MOST OF THESE VEHICLES- IMPACT THOSE COMMUNITIES HEAVILY. AND YEAH. REALLY I WOULD SAY THIS PROGRAM ISN'T JUST PUTTING ELECTRIC TRUCKS ON THE ROAD. REALLY RETRAINING ELECTRIFICATION AS A VIABLE OPTION PRETTY SWEET CUSTOMERS AS THEY LOOK TO THE FUTURE THANKS THANK YOU- NEXT PUBLIC COMMENT PLACE. SCHERING EVEN AT THE WE HAVE A THAT LEFT IN THE QUEUE NEXT MOVE TO LINE THIRTY SEVEN. GO AHEAD. I AM WILL BARRETT WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY- WE AGREE THAT CARD COULD PROVIDE MORE DATA AND ANALYSIS TO ENSURE THE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO MAXIMIZE BENEFITS ESPECIALLY IN OUR TO. ADVANTAGE IS NEEDED AND- WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE WANT TO SEE THESE BENEFITS ARE REFLECTED IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION THAN CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS AND TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT. THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT. SO WHEN EVERYONE TALKING AND WE'RE TALKING TODAY ABOUT THE SOCIETAL BENEFITS. PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS OF REGULATIONS THAT HAVE GOTTEN THEIR MESSAGE HERE AGAIN THESE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE SCOPE OF THE ODD NOT A GEHRY AS DISAPPOINTING. AS NOTED THAT THE AT THE OUTSIDE OF THE MEETING- BY MR STALIN. KERN COUNTY HAS THE MOST DIFFICULT AIR POLLUTION CHALLENGES IN THE UNITED STATES ACCORDING TO THE LUNG ASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL STATE OF THE AIRPORT. OVER THE TWENTY YEARS OF OUR REPORT KERN COUNTY HAS BENEFITED GREATLY FROM PRODUCTION DRIVEN BY CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD REGULATIONS AND LOCAL MEASURES. BUT WE KNOW THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO AND THAT'S WHY THE WONDERS OF THE ASSEMBLY THE CALIFORNIA MIGHT BE MORE AND DO MORE QUICKLY TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND REDUCE CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS AND TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT. THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE CARPET THAT THE STRONGEST TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE STANDARDS PLANAR ERROR. AND THAT THE INCENTIVE INCENTIVES THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED SHOULD ACCELERATE THE BENEFIT THE PACKER TURN OVER TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES ESPECIALLY IN OUR MOST IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. LIKE THOSE ENVISIONED THROUGH THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM HEAVY DUTY ELECTRIC TRUCK AND BUS PROGRAM. CARTON ALSO DO MORE TO TRACK IN THE PANEL TO BENEFIT THE REGULATORY BURDENS INVESTMENT PROGRAM. BUT WE DO HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THE AGENCY IS EQUIPPED TO DO THAT WITHOUT DISTRACTING FROM ITS PUBLIC HEALTH COMMISSION A COMMISSION THE CHAIRED BY THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CARVE REPORTING OUT ON THESE- CORRECTIVE ACTION AND- CORRECT RECORDS AS NEEDED. SO WE ALSO INCLUDING CALL ON THE LEGISLATURE TO NOT ONLY PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO CARVE ON TRACKING ANALYSIS. BUT THE SUPPORT CARD AND STRENGTHENING AND CELEBRATING DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTION. MEASURES INVESTING INTO IN ADDITION THE- ZERO TECHNOLOGIES AND INTEREST. AND HELPING MARKETS COMMUNITY THAT ARE AL RESIDENTS WITH MORE EFFICIENT AND HELP YOUR KIDS WITH A CHOICES.

I'M HERE TO RESPOND TO THE AUDIT REPORTS QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER CARBS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS INFLUENCE CUSTOMER'S BEHAVIOR DOCTORS INFORMED PURCHASE DECISIONS ABOUT LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES ARE VASTLY DIFFERENT THAN THOSE INFLUENCING HEAVY DUTY FLEETS. WITH REGARD TO HEAVY VEHICLES ON THE H. THAT PROGRAM I CAN STATE BEYOND A DOUBT THAT THE PROGRAM SUPPORTS FAILED THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN WITHOUT IT. WE HAVE HAD MULTIPLE CASES WHERE WHERE CUSTOMERS HAVE STIPULATED THEIR PURCHASE BASED ON THE ABILITY OF OBTAINING HFM SENTENCED. EVENSON SAYS WERE RELATED TO PASS SALES OF NATURAL GAS VEHICLES. NOW THAT WE HAVE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE ZERO EMISSION BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES WHICH ARE EXPONENTIALLY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN DIESEL VEHICLES- PAGE PROGRAM HAS BECOME EVEN MORE CRITICAL TO THE- TO THE DECISION OF FLEETS TO PURCHASE THAT. WE HAVE BATTERY ELECTRIC CLASS EIGHT TRUCKS FOR SALE TODAY WHICH ARE AVAILABLE FOR DELIVERY THIS YEAR I'M HERE TO EMPHASIZE THAT WITHOUT ROBUST SUPPORT FOR PURCHASE INCENTIVES LIKE THE H.
