00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.828
MANNER CAN MITIGATE THE DAMAGE

00:09:55.895 --> 00:09:58.197
TO VICTIMS. I FURTHER FEEL THAT

00:09:58.264 --> 00:09:59.732
IT COULD DISCOURAGE THE SHARING

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.834
OF PHOTOS THAT WERE POSTED IN A

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:04.637
MOMENT OF ANGER OR HATE. IT IS

00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:05.705
OFTEN JUVENILES THAT MAKE THESE

00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:07.807

. BY ENACTING THIS LEGISLATION

00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:14.647
WE COULD CREATE ACCOUNTABILITY

00:10:14.714 --> 00:10:16.482

RENDERED BY OUR JURY. THERE'S A

01:25:37.131 --> 01:25:38.032
PARTICULAR REASON WHY THE LIST

FATHER IS ELDERLY. AND ONE OF

01:46:37.858 --> 01:46:39.292
THE BENEFITS OF HAVING THIS

DEVICE IS THAT HE CAN YELL INTO

01:46:41.762 --> 01:46:44.765

SOMETHING OR GET A TELEPHONE

01:46:50.003 --> 01:46:52.339
NUMBER. PRIVACY IS ONE OF THOSE

01:46:52.405 --> 01:46:53.540
SITUATIONS WHERE THERE IS A

01:46:53.607 --> 01:46:57.244
PUBLIC BENEFIT. AND THERE IS A

01:46:57.310 --> 01:46:59.546
PRIVACY DRAWBACK AND THERE'S A

01:46:59.613 --> 01:47:01.815
BALANCE THERE IN SOMEWHERE IN IT

01:47:01.882 --> 01:47:04.985
CHANGES ALL THE TIME ON IN ANY

01:47:05.051 --> 01:47:06.853
GIVEN SCENARIO. THAT'S WHY

01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:10.357
PRIVACY SUCH A STICKY WICKET-

01:47:10.423 --> 01:47:11.725
WE'VE SEEN IT IN TWENTY

01:47:11.792 --> 01:47:13.794
NINETEEN- WHEN WE WERE DEALING

01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:14.828
WITH ALL THESE LEGISLATIVE

01:47:14.895 --> 01:47:16.062
ISSUES IN JUDICIARY AND ON THE

01:47:16.129 --> 01:47:18.165
FLOOR AND THEN OF COURSE THERE

01:47:18.231 --> 01:47:20.033
AFTER PRIVACY IS ONE OF THOSE

01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:23.904
THINGS THAT. WE SHOULD EMBRACE-

01:47:23.970 --> 01:47:26.339
AS THE- A LEGISLATIVE SPACE

01:47:26.406 --> 01:47:27.974
BECAUSE SO MUCH IS CHANGING SO

01:47:28.041 --> 01:47:30.677
QUICKLY WE NEED TO KEEP UP WITH

01:47:30.744 --> 01:47:33.747
THE GOOD ACTORS IN THOSE- THAT

01:47:33.814 --> 01:47:35.816
MAY NOT FIT THAT BILL AS WELL. I

01:47:35.882 --> 01:47:39.085
BELIEVE THAT- THE AUTHOR HERE IS

01:47:39.152 --> 01:47:41.655
DOING. A YEOMAN'S JOB OF TRYING

01:47:41.721 --> 01:47:43.323
TO CREATE A BALANCE THAT LOOKS

01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:46.159
AFTER. THE INDUSTRY'S NEEDS.

01:47:46.226 --> 01:47:47.627
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT

01:47:47.694 --> 01:47:49.729
DANCING TO THESE TECHNOLOGIES.

01:47:49.796 --> 01:47:50.697
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE

01:47:50.764 --> 01:47:53.266
ALLOWING A. I. TO BECOME AN

01:47:53.333 --> 01:47:55.702
EVERYDAY COMPONENT OF OUR LIVES.

AND LORD KNOWS IF YOU'RE A

01:47:56.603 --> 01:47:59.206

AND THAT'S THE FURTHEST REACHES.

01:48:00.907 --> 01:48:05.078
OF HOW AI IS BEING USED. IN THE

01:48:05.145 --> 01:48:06.746
MORNING VARIOUS WAYS. WE'RE NOT

01:48:06.813 --> 01:48:08.849
IN THAT SITUATION WE DO HAVE TO

01:48:08.915 --> 01:48:10.984
LOOK AFTER. THE- PERCEIVED

01:48:11.051 --> 01:48:12.719
RIGHTS IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL

01:48:12.786 --> 01:48:15.789
PROTECTED RIGHTS THAT WE HAVE

01:48:15.856 --> 01:48:17.057
WITH THE IDEAS OF PRIVACY IN THE

01:48:17.123 --> 01:48:19.192
HOME. SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT

RESOLVED MAYBE SOME CAN BE BE

01:48:43.450 --> 01:48:45.285
