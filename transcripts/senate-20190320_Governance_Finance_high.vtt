OPPOSED SP --

00:30:18.516 --> 00:30:19.050
ONE TWENTY EIGHT ONE REITERATE

00:30:19.117 --> 00:30:21.152
FIRST OF ALL MEMBERS THAT AND

00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:22.620
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT A NEW TAX

00:30:22.687 --> 00:30:24.355
THIS USES EXISTING PROPERTY TAX

00:30:24.422 --> 00:30:25.290
REVENUE.

00:30:25.356 --> 00:30:26.424
THEY'RE NOT SURE WHICH OPPONENTS

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:27.525
MADE THAT ARGUMENT BUT IT'S

00:30:27.592 --> 00:30:30.662
CERTAINLY NOT US --

00:30:30.728 --> 00:30:32.096
JUST BY WAY OF CONTEXT SENATOR

00:30:32.163 --> 00:30:34.799
BAIL DID INTRODUCE SB SIX TWENTY

00:30:34.866 --> 00:30:36.434
EIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN

00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:37.835
HARRY JARVIS ALSO DID OPOSE

00:30:37.902 --> 00:30:40.104
THAT BAIL --

00:30:40.171 --> 00:30:41.906
FOR THE REASON PRIMARILY THAT A

00:30:41.973 --> 00:30:43.541
IT FAILED TO SET A TWO THIRDS

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:46.644
VOTE REQUIREMENT FOR LONG TERM-DAD -- AND

00:30:46.711 --> 00:30:48.346
OBVIOUSLY THIS BILL IN ITS ANY

00:30:48.413 --> 00:30:49.914
VOTER APPROVAL SO OBVIOUSLY WE

00:30:49.981 --> 00:30:50.915
WOULD CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THE

00:30:50.982 --> 00:30:52.684
BELL WERE CONCERNED MEMBERS THAT

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.052
SP ONE TWENTY EIGHT REALLY DOES

00:30:54.118 --> 00:30:56.087
DISREGARD OVER A HUNDRED YEARS

00:30:56.154 --> 00:30:57.188
OF PRECEDENT.

00:30:57.255 --> 00:30:59.557
REGARDING THE ISSUANCE OF VOTER

00:30:59.624 --> 00:31:00.959
APPROVED AT IN THE CALIFORNIA

00:31:01.025 --> 00:31:02.360
CONSTITUTION AND REALLY THE

00:31:02.427 --> 00:31:04.862
STATES ALL THE WAY BACK TO

00:31:04.929 --> 00:31:05.330
EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE

00:31:05.396 --> 00:31:07.065
PRACTICALLY ALL BONDS NOT ALL

00:31:07.131 --> 00:31:08.800
BUT CERTAINLY THE LARGE MAJORITY

00:31:08.866 --> 00:31:10.101
HAVE ACQUIRED A SUPER MAJORITY

00:31:10.168 --> 00:31:11.069
THRESHOLD.

00:31:11.135 --> 00:31:15.073
OF 55% OR HIGHER TO BE APPROVED --

00:31:15.139 --> 00:31:16.574
AND I THINK THAT MAINTAINING

00:31:16.641 --> 00:31:17.875
THAT SUPER MAJORITY THRESHOLDS

00:31:17.942 --> 00:31:19.244
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:21.012
THIS IS DAD THAT'S GOING TO

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:23.214
REMAIN ON THE BOOKS --

00:31:23.281 --> 00:31:25.116
FOUR YEARS AFTER THE I FD BOARD

00:31:25.183 --> 00:31:26.751
WHICH IS CONSISTING OF LOCAL

00:31:26.818 --> 00:31:28.319
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS PRIMARILY

00:31:28.386 --> 00:31:29.887
HAS TURNED OUT.

00:31:29.954 --> 00:31:30.555
THEY'VE APPROVED IT THEY TURNED

00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:32.790
OUT THIS DATA IS ON THE BOOKS

00:31:32.857 --> 00:31:35.159
FOR AS LONG AS FORTY FIVE YEARS.

00:31:35.226 --> 00:31:36.694
AND BECAUSE OF THAT THERE NEEDS

00:31:36.761 --> 00:31:38.363
TO BE VOTER ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:31:38.429 --> 00:31:39.931
IN ADDITION E. I. F. T. BONDS

00:31:39.998 --> 00:31:41.933
ARE NOT THE SAME AS LOCAL

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.804
GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND.

00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:47.272
OKAY --

00:31:47.338 --> 00:31:48.039
LOCAL GEO BONDS HAVE THE FULL

00:31:48.106 --> 00:31:48.906
FAITH AND CREDIT OF A LOCAL

00:31:48.973 --> 00:31:50.275
GENERAL FIND BACK IN THE BLIND

00:31:50.341 --> 00:31:51.676
YEAH I F. T. BOND THAT'S NOT THE

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:52.910
CASE THEY DON'T HAVE THE FULL

00:31:52.977 --> 00:31:53.978
FAITH AND CREDIT.

00:31:54.045 --> 00:31:55.513
OF THE MUNICIPALITY BACKING UP

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.881
THE SPONSOR IS NOT THAT

00:31:56.948 --> 00:31:58.483
ASSURANCE AND WE DO THINK THAT

00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:59.951
CREATES A MUCH GREATER RISK FOR

00:32:00.018 --> 00:32:02.687
TAX PAYERS AS WELL AS HIGHER

00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:04.022
INTEREST COSTS --

00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:05.590
I WILL SAY IN REGARDS TO THE

00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:07.325

YOU KNOW WE ARE PLEASED

00:32:10.495 --> 00:32:11.362
OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT'S AN

00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:13.064
AMENDMENT IN THE BILL BECAUSE IT

00:32:13.131 --> 00:32:15.566
DOES PROVIDE SOME PROCESS FOR

00:32:15.633 --> 00:32:17.201
TAXPAYERS TO SPEAK.

00:32:17.268 --> 00:32:19.137
INTO THE I FD BONDS IN THE

00:32:19.203 --> 00:32:20.772
SITUATION THEY'RE IN BUT IT'S

00:32:20.838 --> 00:32:23.207
NOT THE SAME AS AN ACTUAL VOTE.

00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:24.309

E. I. F. T. FORMATION IT'S

00:32:29.314 --> 00:32:31.249
DEFINITELY NOT THE SAME AS AN

00:54:30.467 --> 00:54:33.570
CONCERN NOT ABOUT THE ISSUE BUT

00:54:33.637 --> 00:54:35.505
ABOUT THE BIGGER PICTURE THANK.

00:54:35.572 --> 00:54:37.540
GOVERNOR BROWN --

00:54:37.607 --> 00:54:40.143
FOR HARD TO CHANGE OUR LAW WITH

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:41.645
RESPECT TO REDEVELOPMENT

00:54:41.711 --> 00:54:42.846
AGENCIES.

00:54:42.912 --> 00:54:45.081
IN MY VIEW FOR THREE IMPORTANT

00:54:45.148 --> 00:54:46.816
REASONS FIRST.

00:54:46.883 --> 00:54:49.319
HE AND HIS ROLE AS THE MAYOR OF

00:54:49.386 --> 00:54:51.554
THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CITY WAS

00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:53.623
INFORMED BY.

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:55.125
ABUSES IN OTHER THINGS THAT HE

00:54:55.191 --> 00:54:56.426
WAS CONCERNED ABOUT LOCAL

00:54:56.493 --> 00:54:57.427
GOVERNMENT AND THE VELLUM

00:54:57.494 --> 00:54:58.828
DEVELOPERS.

00:54:58.895 --> 00:55:00.630
TO HE WAS CONCERNED THAT --

00:55:00.697 --> 00:55:03.133
USING TAX INCREMENT FINANCING

00:55:03.199 --> 00:55:04.668
ADVERSELY AFFECTED EDUCATION

00:55:04.734 --> 00:55:06.436
WHICH WE JUST HEARD.

00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:07.837
AND COULD DO SO IN THE FUTURE.

00:55:07.904 --> 00:55:09.673
AND THIRD THE COUNTIES WERE

00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:10.907
BEING ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE

00:55:10.974 --> 00:55:12.275
SOCIAL SAFETY NET FUNDS THAT

00:55:12.342 --> 00:55:13.977
WERE AVAILABLE.

00:55:14.044 --> 00:55:16.246
SO THE QUESTION BECOMES IN AREAS

00:55:16.312 --> 00:55:17.447
WHERE THROUGH AN INFRASTRUCTURE

00:55:17.514 --> 00:55:21.117
DEVELOPMENT OR THE LIKE HOW DO

00:55:21.184 --> 00:55:22.886
YOU GET FUNDING TO GET THERE --

00:55:22.952 --> 00:55:24.688
THERE HAS BEEN AND WE'RE IN THE

00:55:24.754 --> 00:55:26.222
PROCESS OF DEALING WITH THE

00:55:26.289 --> 00:55:27.791
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THIS NOTION

00:55:27.857 --> 00:55:29.225
OF OPPORTUNITIES OWNS.

00:55:29.292 --> 00:55:31.027
OPPORTUNITIES OWNS USES INSTEAD

00:55:31.094 --> 00:55:33.697
OF TAX FUND A PROPERTY TAX MONEY.

00:55:33.763 --> 00:55:36.299
WHICH IS SO MUCH STRESS ON IT.

00:55:36.366 --> 00:55:39.536
UTILIZES INCOME TAX AND THE

00:55:39.602 --> 00:55:41.337
BENEFIT OF THAT IS BECAUSE THE

00:55:41.404 --> 00:55:42.605
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHANGED THE

00:55:42.672 --> 00:55:43.540
LAW THAT MAKES LESS

00:55:43.606 --> 00:55:44.441
DEDUCTIBILITY FOR US IN

00:55:44.507 --> 00:55:46.109
CALIFORNIA.

00:55:46.176 --> 00:55:48.178
BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS IS THAT IT

00:55:48.244 --> 00:55:49.345
THERE'S ACTUAL INCENTIVE IN

00:55:49.412 --> 00:55:51.781
CALIFORNIA UTILIZE INCOME TAX.

00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:52.982
TO ACHIEVE THE DELIVERABLES YOU

00:55:53.049 --> 00:55:54.017
DON'T REALLY CARE WHERE THE

00:55:54.084 --> 00:55:55.151
MONEY COMES FROM YOU CARE ABOUT

00:55:55.218 --> 00:55:56.920
A DEDICATED REVENUE STREAM THAT

00:55:56.986 --> 00:55:58.655
GROWS AS FINANCE WILL THAT WILL

00:55:58.722 --> 00:56:00.056
ALLOW THE THE OBJECTIVE TO BE

00:56:00.123 --> 00:56:02.392
ACHIEVED WITHOUT ADVERSELY

00:56:02.459 --> 00:56:03.026
AFFECTING OTHER IMPORTANT SOCIAL

00:56:03.093 --> 00:56:03.760
ISSUES.

00:56:03.827 --> 00:56:05.095
AND SO I KNOW THE GOVERNOR JUST

00:56:05.161 --> 00:56:06.529
SPOKE RECENTLY THERE'S BEEN

00:56:06.596 --> 00:56:07.630
CONFERENCES ALL OVER THE PLACE

00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:09.032
IS PEOPLE HUSTLING EVERYWHERE

00:56:09.099 --> 00:56:10.567
THE REGULATIONS ARE.

00:56:10.633 --> 00:56:12.702
UNDER REVIEW WE'RE WORKING FULL

00:56:12.769 --> 00:56:14.104
TIME IN THIS AREA AND SO.

00:56:14.170 --> 00:56:15.939
ALL I'M SUGGESTING IS IT IN MY

00:56:16.005 --> 00:56:17.140
PURPOSE OF MY COMMENTS IS NOT TO

00:56:17.207 --> 00:56:19.309
LOSE ANY OF THE JUST TO SIGN

00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:19.809
POST THIS ISSUE FOR THIS

00:56:19.876 --> 00:56:20.910
COMMITTEE.

00:56:20.977 --> 00:56:22.178
BOTH WITH RESPECT ON THE TAX

00:56:22.245 --> 00:56:23.480
ELEMENT AND TO TRY TO THINK

00:56:23.546 --> 00:56:25.248
THROUGH IN RE ENGINEER AS WE GO

00:56:25.315 --> 00:56:26.349
FORWARD.

00:56:26.416 --> 00:56:27.417
PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT

00:56:27.484 --> 00:56:28.485
WE DON'T HAVE A DEDUCTIBILITY OF

00:56:28.551 --> 00:56:31.221
SOMEBODY'S TAXES AT THE AT A

00:56:31.287 --> 00:56:32.555
BECAUSE THE FEDERAL LAW THAT

00:56:32.622 --> 00:56:34.157
THERE COULD BE SOME INTERESTING

00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:36.326
AND EASY WAYS. TO ACHIEVE THE

00:56:36.392 --> 00:56:37.761
EXACT DELIVERABLES THAT YOU WANT

00:56:37.827 --> 00:56:39.095
TO ACHIEVE THEIR ALTERNATIVE

00:56:39.162 --> 00:56:40.263
MECHANISM.

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:42.065
BUT I DO THINK PARTICULARLY

00:56:42.132 --> 00:56:45.135

OF CONTINUING THIS DISCUSSION

00:56:52.475 --> 00:56:54.177
BUT I JUST WANT TO SIGN POST IS

00:56:54.244 --> 00:56:55.745
BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT WE'RE IN

00:56:55.812 --> 00:56:57.447
A IN A IS A A PLACE WHERE --

00:56:57.514 --> 00:56:59.215

00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:19.896
STARTING OFF AT TWO HUNDRED

00:58:19.963 --> 00:58:20.897
MILLION NOT FIVE AND A HALF

00:58:20.964 --> 00:58:22.632

00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:01.237
IN THE ASSEMBLY.

00:59:01.304 --> 00:59:02.672
WE WERE GOING FROM I THINK WHEN

MILLET BILLION SO IT WAS IT WAS

00:59:12.448 --> 00:59:14.183

00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:15.752
CUT BACK [inaudible]

00:59:15.818 --> 00:59:18.888
OF DAD IT RESULTED AND WE HAD TO

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:20.823
REALLY.

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:22.725
MASSIVELY CUT ALL KINDS OF

00:59:22.792 --> 00:59:23.960

00:59:30.066 --> 00:59:32.268

AS OPPOSED TO REDEVELOPMENT HAS.

00:59:36.973 --> 00:59:39.309
A SERIES OF THINGS INCLUDING THE

00:59:39.375 --> 00:59:41.611
RE MENTIONING A MEMBERS WE JUST --

00:59:41.678 --> 00:59:43.313

00:59:43.379 --> 00:59:45.081
PROTECT SCHOOL FUNDING.

00:59:45.148 --> 00:59:47.216
NOW THE SCHOOL'S ARGUMENT WE'RE

00:59:47.283 --> 00:59:47.850
GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

00:59:47.917 --> 00:59:48.851
THEM ON THIS.

00:59:48.918 --> 00:59:53.389
IS THAT YOU'RE STILL MAKING.

00:59:53.456 --> 00:59:55.858
THE GENERAL FUND POT LOWER.

00:59:55.925 --> 00:59:59.796
THAT ARGUMENT WOULD STILL APPLY --

00:59:59.862 --> 01:00:01.698
FOR OPPORTUNITY CELLS AS WELL IT

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:03.333
WOULD IT WOULD IT WOULD.

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:04.400
YOU KNOW THEIR THEIR ARGUMENT OF

01:00:04.467 --> 01:00:06.936
THE GENERAL FUND BEING --

01:00:07.003 --> 01:00:08.805
LESS RESOURCES PUTS MORE

01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:11.975
PRESSURE ON SCHOOL FINANCE.

01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:13.343
SO THAT'S THAT'S THE ARGUMENT

01:00:13.409 --> 01:00:14.978
BUT THE BILLITSELF THAT

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:16.512
ARGUMENT COULD BE APPLIED TO ANY

01:00:16.579 --> 01:00:17.814

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.349
OF GENERAL FUND MONEY THAT'S

01:00:19.415 --> 01:00:21.050
OUTSIDE THE SCHOOLS HOW ABOUT

01:00:21.117 --> 01:00:22.352

YOU KNOW I JUST YOU KNOW BRING

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:28.491

ON THAT ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:00:31.227 --> 01:00:32.428

BILLION DOLLARS JUST IN ONE YEAR?

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:39.869
AND AND AND THAT YOU SAID YOU

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:40.636

01:00:40.703 --> 01:00:42.005
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OF COURSE TO

01:00:42.071 --> 01:00:44.874

THE TAX INCREMENT PROGRAM.

01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:02.025
SO THE LEGISLATURE AS OPPOSED TO

01:01:02.091 --> 01:01:03.526
REDEVELOPMENT WOULD JUST KIND OF

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:04.961

LEGISLATURE TO DO THAT --

01:01:21.811 --> 01:01:22.979
THE THIRD THINK THE THIRD THING

01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:26.749
REDEVELOPMENT.

01:01:26.816 --> 01:01:28.251
REDEVELOPMENT --

01:01:28.317 --> 01:01:30.620
REALLY WAS FURTHER MORE IT

01:01:30.686 --> 01:01:31.754
DIDN'T HAVE ANY ACCOUNTABILITY

01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:33.656
MEASURES THIS BILL HAS A LOT OF

01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:34.991
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES IT

01:01:35.058 --> 01:01:36.826
SPECIFIES WHERE THE MONEY HAS TO

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:38.661
BE SPENT IT REQUIRES THEM TO

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:41.998
COME UP WITH A A PLAN TO SUBMIT.

01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:43.032
THAT OUTLINES WHERE THE MONEY'S

01:01:43.099 --> 01:01:44.467
GOING TO BE SPENT.

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.536
IT ALLOWS A COMMITTEE TO REVIEW

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:47.837
THAT IT ALLOWS A COMMITTEE TO

01:01:47.904 --> 01:01:49.539
SAY IF YOU ARE COMPLETING YOUR

01:01:49.605 --> 01:01:52.575

MUCH IT.

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:20.036
SO.

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:21.404
SO -- THIS

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:22.972
HAS USES DIFFERENT.

01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:24.941
AND BY SETTING UP THE PARAMETERS

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:27.176
OF WHERE WE WE WANT TO SPEND THE

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:28.511
MONEY -- WE

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:30.213
ARE BENEFITING CERTAIN THINGS

01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:31.581
AND TARGETING THE MONEY TO

01:02:31.647 --> 01:02:32.949
CERTAIN THINGS THAT'S WHY.

01:02:33.015 --> 01:02:34.584
THE MAJORITY THE MONEY WILL BE

I WAS TRYING TO DO.

01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:19.922
IT WAS TO RAISE THIS ISSUE IN

01:04:19.989 --> 01:04:21.624

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:41.244
METHODOLOGIES COULD BE A MORE

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:42.445
EFFECTIVE WAY THAT FACT CREATE

01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:44.313
MORE HOUSING --

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.481
WHICH THE GOVERNOR TALKED ABOUT

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:47.316
THE OTHER DAY IN IN IN YOUR

01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:48.851
DISTRICT --

01:04:48.918 --> 01:04:51.954
SO SO THE THE THE A A AND AND A

01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:53.990
LARGER DYNAMIC OF PEAK SHAPING

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:55.758
THE JUST THE LAST POINT I WANT

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:57.260
TO RAISE IS THAT THE WHEN YOU

01:04:57.326 --> 01:04:58.261
TALKED ABOUT.

01:04:58.327 --> 01:04:59.328
WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU

01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:00.329
SUFFERED THROUGH WHEN YOU WERE

01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:03.432
HERE AND I WASN'T AT THAT TIME --

01:05:03.499 --> 01:05:05.067
WAS WAS THE THE VOLATILITY OF

01:05:05.134 --> 01:05:06.602
THE OF THE REVENUE SYSTEM THAT

01:05:06.669 --> 01:05:08.104
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS COMMITTEE

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.038
FOR YEARS.

01:05:09.105 --> 01:05:11.307
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE HAD A

01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:13.743
3% DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY AT

01:05:13.809 --> 01:05:15.378
23% DOWNTURN IN THE BUDGET.

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:17.246
THAT COMES FROM THE MECHANISMS

01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:18.648
THAT WE USE TO FIND THE STATE

01:05:18.714 --> 01:05:20.549
AND THE CHALLENGE THAT HAS.

01:05:20.616 --> 01:05:21.951
THE GENIUS OF THE OPPORTUNITY

01:05:22.018 --> 01:05:24.253
ZONE ELEMENT AS IT INTEGRATES

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.322
WITH PROP NINETY EIGHT AND ALL

01:05:26.389 --> 01:05:28.090
OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS AS I WANT

01:05:28.157 --> 01:05:28.958
TO JUST.

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:30.660
AGAIN I'M NOT DIGGING AS DEEP AS

01:05:30.726 --> 01:05:31.961
YOU HAVE A JUST ONE TOP WANTED

01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:33.296
FOR THE DISCUSSION THIS

01:05:33.362 --> 01:05:34.797
COMMITTEE IS ITS PEAK SHAPE.

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:35.965
BECAUSE IN ESSENCE WHAT IT DOES

01:05:36.032 --> 01:05:37.767
IT DEALS WITH CAPITAL GAINS THAT

01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:39.135
WE DON'T DEAL WITH SO WE CAN

01:05:39.201 --> 01:05:40.636
CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE SE SERVICE

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:45.374
TAX THAT WOULD GO LIKE THIS.

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:46.208
GET RID OF THE PEKING.

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:48.010
USE THIS TO HELP COMMUNITIES

01:05:48.077 --> 01:05:48.577
THAT OPPORTUNITY ZONES THIS

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:49.945
COULD ALL BE PART OF A LARGER

01:05:50.012 --> 01:05:51.947
DISCUSSION FINALLY TOUCH THIS

01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:52.815
BECAUSE IT'S IN THE WORLD THAT

01:05:52.882 --> 01:05:53.716
I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH IN TRYING

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:55.117
TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION TO THIS

01:05:55.184 --> 01:05:56.719
COMMITTEE MY FORMER CAPACITY.

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:57.887
OF WHICH YOU'VE BEEN WITH US FOR

01:05:57.953 --> 01:05:59.255
OVER FOUR YEARS WHEN I WAS HERE

01:05:59.322 --> 01:06:00.723
ORIGINALLY AND JUST TO THROW ON

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.291
THE TABLE FOR THINKING BECAUSE I

01:06:02.358 --> 01:06:03.526
KNOW THAT YOU THINK ABOUT THIS

01:06:03.592 --> 01:06:05.294
STUFF I THINK THIS IS ALL ABOUT

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:06.796
VOTING FOR THE MOVE THE BILL.

01:06:06.862 --> 01:06:10.566

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:12.134
SOLUTION FOR YA.

01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:13.002
I THINK CENTER WINNERS TAKEN --

01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:14.737
CHARGE OF GETTING THAT --

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.405
WORKING ON THAT THIS IS THIS IS

01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:17.740
A PIECE OF IT THOUGH.

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:19.141
THIS THIS IS SO ALL RIGHT AN

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:21.077
OPPORTUNITY ROSE COULD BE

01:06:21.143 --> 01:06:22.511
ANOTHER PIECE WE NEED A LOT OF

01:06:22.578 --> 01:06:24.313
IT WE GOT WE'RE WE'RE SUCH AND

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.848
SUCH BAD TROUBLE WE NEED TO DO A

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:27.883
LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. TO TO

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:29.652
SOLVE THAT PROBLEM PROBLEM.

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:31.020
THANK YOU IT IS AN INTERNAL

01:06:31.087 --> 01:06:34.690
COMBUSTION INDOCIN WINNER I

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:35.758
THINK THE ONE ISSUE.

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:36.359
WHEN CENTER BELL AND I WERE

01:06:36.425 --> 01:06:37.126
LOOKING AT THE ISSUE OF

01:06:37.193 --> 01:06:37.860
OPPORTUNITIES --

01:06:37.927 --> 01:06:38.427
THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS IN

01:06:38.494 --> 01:06:40.730
NUMBER ONE LOOK AT WERE

01:06:40.796 --> 01:06:42.665
OPPORTUNITIES OWN SEVEN PLACE IT

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:44.100
BENEFITS THE WEALTHIEST WITHIN

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:45.434
THE COMMUNITY.

01:06:45.501 --> 01:06:47.336
AND THEN THERE IS A HUGE HIT TO

01:06:47.403 --> 01:06:49.372
THE STATE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE

01:06:49.438 --> 01:06:52.375
IT CAPS GAINS TO THE STATE

01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:53.976
GENERAL FUND --

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:54.510
TO TWENTY FORTY SEVEN AND

01:06:54.577 --> 01:06:55.745
THERE'SNO WAY TO BE A CONTROL

01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:56.379
THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE TO

01:06:56.445 --> 01:06:58.647
CONFORM WITH NEW TAX CODE WITH

01:06:58.714 --> 01:06:59.982
THE FEDS.

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:00.683
SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A HUGE

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.284
HIT -- AS WE

01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:04.286
MOVE FORWARD ON THIS OPPORTUNITY

IT AS WELL AS FAR AS THAT FLOW

01:07:34.617 --> 01:07:36.819
IN BECAUSE IT DOES CAP GAINS.

ANYTHING GOING FORWARD THROUGH

01:07:38.587 --> 01:07:41.190
TWENTY FORTY SEVEN BUT I KNOW

01:07:41.257 --> 01:07:42.024

PARK OR WHO'S.

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:07.343
TRY TO PULL THE STUFF TOGETHER --

01:09:07.409 --> 01:09:08.444
TO RESPOND.

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:09.678
I THINK THE THE RESPONSE I'D

01:09:09.745 --> 01:09:11.313
GIVE TO THAT IS THAT ALL OF THE

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:12.248
ITEMS YOU JUST MENTIONED ARE

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.149
FORMS OF TAX INCREMENT FINANCING

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:15.985
BUT BUT ALL OF THEM SHARE THE

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:17.720
COMMON CONSTRAINT THAT.

01:09:17.786 --> 01:09:20.523
THE FUNDING THAT CAN GO TO THEM.

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:21.924
IS PURELY VOLUNTARY AND MAIN

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:23.359
MAINLY BASED ON ON LOCAL

01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:24.493
GOVERNMENT --

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.394
SHARE AND THAT'S THAT'S WHEN THE

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:26.862
CHALLENGES WE HAVE WITH THESE

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:28.130
NEW TOOLS.

01:09:28.197 --> 01:09:29.431
IS THAT THE THE SHARE THAT LOCAL

01:09:29.498 --> 01:09:30.799
GOVERNMENTS RECEIVE.

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:32.201
JUST ISN'T ENOUGH TO MAKE A GO

01:09:32.268 --> 01:09:34.770
OF A MEANINGFUL --

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.171
WHAT IS REQUIRED TO ACTUALLY

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:37.206
ISSUE BONDS AND FINANCE PROJECTS

01:09:37.273 --> 01:09:38.874
SO?

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:39.942
THAT'S THE UNIQUENESS OF THIS

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:42.378
BILL IT PROVIDES A MECHANISM TO

01:09:42.444 --> 01:09:43.812
INCREASE THE PULL OF FUNDING

01:09:43.879 --> 01:09:45.014
THAT WE GO TO THE TAX INCREMENT

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:45.781
STREAM --

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:47.750
PUTS THE STATE AND IN CONTROL OF

01:09:47.816 --> 01:09:48.484
IT -- TO

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:49.552
MAKE SURE THAT IT'S RESPONSIBLE

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:50.853
SO IT DEALS WITH SORT SORT OF

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.688
THAT THAT MAIN ISSUE THAT ALL OF

01:09:52.755 --> 01:09:54.290
THOSE MECHANISMS YOU MENTION

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:55.691
SHARE.

01:09:55.758 --> 01:09:57.526
WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE BILL --

01:09:57.593 --> 01:09:58.961
IN THROUGH THE YOU KNOW ALL THE

01:09:59.028 --> 01:09:59.895
MATERIAL.

01:09:59.962 --> 01:10:02.131
IT SEEMS EXTREMELY COMPLEX AND

01:10:02.197 --> 01:10:02.965
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU DID A LOT OF

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:04.934
WORK AND MAYBE TRY TO ANSWER TOO

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.069
MANY QUESTIONS ARE PERTINENT.

01:10:07.136 --> 01:10:10.606
SO MUCH BUT I I WAS CURIOUS WHY

01:10:10.673 --> 01:10:15.210
IS IT SUCH A SO MASSIVE.

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:18.414
THE BILL IS NOT HOUSES IT'S TWO

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:19.515
HUNDRED THE BOTTOM LINE IS THERE

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:24.053
IS THERE IS A A BUILD UP OVER

01:10:24.119 --> 01:10:24.954
TEN YEARS.

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:27.122
FROM TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:29.792
COMPARED TO FIVE POINT FOUR

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:31.226
BILLION AND REDEVELOPMENT FUNDS.

01:10:31.293 --> 01:10:32.895
WHEN IT WHEN THE THE LAST YEAR

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:34.263
REDEVELOPMENT?

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:37.132
SO IT BUILDS UP. TO A CAB IN THE

01:10:37.199 --> 01:10:39.935
BILL OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS TEN

01:10:40.002 --> 01:10:41.036
YEARS FROM NOW BUT I AM I REALLY

01:10:41.103 --> 01:10:42.404
SO IT'S NOT.

01:10:42.471 --> 01:10:44.673
IT'S NOT A YOU PUT INTO THIS

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.075
BILL THERE'S THERE'S SO MUCH

01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:47.576
RICHER YOU'RE YOU'RE TAKING INTO

01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:48.911
ACCOUNT IT JUST SEEMS SO.

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:50.913
COMPLEX I UNDERSTAND HOW YOUR

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:54.316
PHASING IT THE OUT OF ON OKAY I

01:10:54.383 --> 01:10:55.851
CAN GIVE YOU AN ANSWER IS

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:56.652
SIMILAR TO WHAT IS SAID TO

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:58.020
CENTER HERTZBERG.

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:00.456
WE ARE VERY AWARE I AM

01:11:00.522 --> 01:11:01.991
PERSONALLY VERY AWARE.

01:11:02.057 --> 01:11:03.792
OF ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT

01:11:03.859 --> 01:11:05.628
REDEVELOPMENT --

01:11:05.694 --> 01:11:06.595
HAD.

01:11:06.662 --> 01:11:07.896
WITH THERE'S A LOT OF STUDIES ON

01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:09.431
THIS.

01:11:09.498 --> 01:11:12.034
OUR REDEVELOPMENT WAS NOT GOOD

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:13.168
IN TERMS OF RETURN ON ITS

01:11:13.235 --> 01:11:14.670
INVESTMENT I MEAN THERE'S A LOT

01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:16.005
OF MISTAKES IT WAS.

01:11:16.071 --> 01:11:17.840
MONEY THAT SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT

01:11:17.906 --> 01:11:19.708
COULD HAVE BEEN USED IN A BETTER

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:21.310
WAY MAYBE.

01:11:21.377 --> 01:11:23.379
PERHAPS IN TERMS OF AN ECONOMIC

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:25.547
DEVELOPMENT TO DEFINE OUR

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:27.883
SCHOOLS FOR EXAMPLE --

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:29.618
YES AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WE USED

01:11:29.685 --> 01:11:31.286
IT FOR WITH REDEVELOPMENT.

01:11:31.353 --> 01:11:33.355
THE HOUSING REQUIREMENT WAS ONLY

01:11:33.422 --> 01:11:35.758
20% IT DID REQUIRE THEM TO SPEND

01:11:35.824 --> 01:11:37.092
THE MONEY IT REQUIRED THEM TO

01:11:37.159 --> 01:11:38.460
SET ASIDE THE MONEY.

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:40.696
IN A LOT OF CITIES DID SET ASIDE

01:11:40.763 --> 01:11:42.231
THE MONEY BUT THEY NEVER SPENT.

01:11:42.297 --> 01:11:43.832
YOU KNOW THEY KEPT THOSE BOUNCES

01:11:43.899 --> 01:11:44.967
VERY HIGH.

01:11:45.034 --> 01:11:47.670
AND OUT OF THIS BILL DEALS WITH

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:49.672
THE VERY THE REASON WHY.

01:11:49.738 --> 01:11:52.041
THIS BILL SOUNDS COMPLICATED IT

01:11:52.107 --> 01:11:53.442
REALLY ISN'T BUT IT DEALS WITH

01:11:53.509 --> 01:11:55.277
THE PROBLEMS THAT WORK WITH THAT

01:11:55.344 --> 01:11:58.313
WE WERE RECOGNIZED AND WITH

01:11:58.380 --> 01:11:59.114
LESSONS WE LEARNED.

01:11:59.181 --> 01:12:00.849
AND BAD REDEVELOPMENT FINANCING

01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:02.951
OF THE PAST.

01:12:03.018 --> 01:12:05.487
AND THAT'S WHAT I ANSWER TO

01:12:05.554 --> 01:12:06.588
SENATOR HERTZBERG HAS YET TRIED

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:07.790
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING --

01:12:07.856 --> 01:12:11.427
SO IT CREATES A ANSWER TO THE

01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:12.928
PROBLEMS.

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:14.329
AT AN EVENT IF YOU REALIZE IT'S

01:12:14.396 --> 01:12:15.864
WE CAN'T JUST HAVE A SIMPLE BILL

01:12:15.931 --> 01:12:17.566
THAT ALLOWS REDEVELOPMENT.

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:18.767
I DON'T I WOULD VOTE FOR IT

01:12:18.834 --> 01:12:21.437
MYSELF I THINK THAT WE THAT

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:22.838
OCCURRED IN THE PAST I LIVE SO I

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:24.039
HAD TO I HAD TO DO IT A

01:12:24.106 --> 01:12:25.140
DIFFERENT WAY.

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:27.109
AND AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DO

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:29.178
IT NO A NEW WAY IN ORDER TO

01:12:29.244 --> 01:12:30.446
REFLECT HARD WORK AND SO I'M

01:12:30.512 --> 01:12:31.714
SORT OF POKING AND ASK YOU A

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.415
LITTLE BIT CAN'T WE CAN'T GO

01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:34.683
BACK TO WHERE IT WAS.

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:38.887
BUT STATE OVERSIGHT I'M GETTING

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:39.455
A LITTLE CYNICAL ABOUT STATE

01:12:39.521 --> 01:12:40.322
OVERSIGHT.

01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:41.924
WE WILL GET.

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:43.058
STATE AUDITOR REPORTS AND

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:44.660
NOTHING HAPPENS WE HAVE ELLIE --

01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:46.762
REPORTS NOTHING HAPPENS NOW THE

01:12:46.829 --> 01:12:48.163
ONLY OVERSIGHT I'M SEEING ON

01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:49.832
HOUSING IS I HAVE THE ATTORNEY

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:51.600
GENERAL SUING ONE OF MY CITIES.

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:53.802
YEAH SO ARE THAT THAT DOESN'T

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:56.038
SEEM LIKE A A COLLABORATIVE

01:12:56.105 --> 01:12:57.940
EFFORT WITH THE PARENT COMPANY

01:12:58.006 --> 01:12:59.742
AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES --

01:12:59.808 --> 01:13:01.744
COULD YOU HAD.

01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:02.878
TELL ME IN THROUGH THIS WHOLE

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:04.446
PROCESS WHAT YOU ENVISION AS

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:05.547
STATE OVERSIGHT NOW IT'LL BE

01:13:05.614 --> 01:13:07.182
EFFECTIVE OTHER SOME VERY STRICT

01:13:07.249 --> 01:13:08.817
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES IN THE

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:09.551
BILL.

01:13:09.618 --> 01:13:11.487
IT HAS OTHER OVERSIGHT HAS AN

01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:13.288
APPROVAL PROCESS FIRST OF ALL

01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:14.223
THEY CAN'T DO IT UNLESS THE

01:13:14.289 --> 01:13:16.024
SUBMIT IT AND GET IT APPROVED

01:13:16.091 --> 01:13:17.326
THERE HAS TO BE A PLAN.

01:13:17.392 --> 01:13:18.894
THEY HAVE TO BE SPECIFIC IN

01:13:18.961 --> 01:13:20.162
TERMS OF WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:21.663
IT HAS TO BE FOR THE FIVE

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:23.232
PURPOSES WHICH ARE IDENTIFIED IN

01:13:23.298 --> 01:13:24.199
THE BILL.

01:13:24.266 --> 01:13:25.734
IT HAS TO HAVE FISCAL

01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:27.436
ACCOUNTABILITY AND PROGRAM%

01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:29.338
ACCOUNTABILITY AND IF IT DOESN'T

01:13:29.404 --> 01:13:32.474
RELATE TO THE FIVE GOALS THAT WE

01:13:32.541 --> 01:13:33.008
HAVE.

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:33.976
IN TERMS OF THE BILL IT WON'T

01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:35.577
GET APPROVED I'LL HAVE TO GO

01:13:35.644 --> 01:13:36.979
BACK AND RE WRITE IT.

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:38.046
AND THEN ONCE IT'S APPROVE

01:13:38.113 --> 01:13:39.982
THERE'S AN ANNUAL REVIEW THERE'S

01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:41.550
AN ANNUAL REPORT THAT HAS TO BE

01:13:41.617 --> 01:13:42.918
SUBMITTED NOT ONLY TO THE

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:44.153
COMMITTEE BUT TO US.

01:13:44.219 --> 01:13:46.555
THE LEGISLATURE THERE HAS TO BE --

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:51.093
A REVIEW OF THEIR PROGRESS

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:54.196
READING THE THE PURPOSES OF OF

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:56.498
THE PLAN THAT THEY SUBMITTED --

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:58.367
AND ALL THAT STUFF IS REVIEWED

01:13:58.433 --> 01:13:59.768
ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:01.236
ON A REGULAR BASIS AND I THINK

01:14:01.303 --> 01:14:02.604
IT IT PROVIDES.

01:14:02.671 --> 01:14:04.840
A VERY GOOD SET OF

01:14:04.907 --> 01:14:06.809
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES --

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:08.744
FILLABLE FISCAL AND FROM A

01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:10.078
PROGRAM STANDPOINT.

01:14:10.145 --> 01:14:11.947
MISTER CITY MANAGER YOU'RE READY

01:14:12.014 --> 01:14:13.549
TO PUT UP WITH ALL THAT.

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:14.683
YOU KNOW JUST THINKING THAT THAT

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:16.218
THE IT REMINDS ME OF A MORE LIKE

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:17.920
A GRANT APPLICATION PROCESS

01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:19.721
ANGELA ANNUALLY --

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:21.557
I THINK SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:22.391
THE CITIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING

01:14:22.457 --> 01:14:23.258
TO MAKE MAKE --

01:14:23.325 --> 01:14:24.893
THE NEW PROGRAMS WORK --

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.962
THIS WOULD.

01:14:27.029 --> 01:14:29.131
BE A GAME CHANGER POTENTIALLY SO.

01:14:29.198 --> 01:14:32.000
I THINK I'M READY TO RESTORE IT.

01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:33.969
ONE WAY THE MONEY EXPRESSES

01:14:34.036 --> 01:14:35.370
RUSHER SIN WHEN.

01:14:35.437 --> 01:14:37.606
WITH ADDITIONAL COMMENTS I HAVE

01:14:37.673 --> 01:14:38.841
A FEW -- BUT

01:14:38.907 --> 01:14:40.442
ONCE IF WE HAVE ADDITIONAL

01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:41.243
COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:41.543
[inaudible]

01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:43.011
ALL RIGHT [inaudible]

01:14:43.078 --> 01:14:44.913
SO.

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:47.516
CENTRE BELL --

01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:49.151
I WANT TO ECHO WHAT YOU HAD SAID

01:14:49.218 --> 01:14:52.321
THIS BILL HAS BEEN BASED IN

01:14:52.387 --> 01:14:55.057
EVIDENCE AND TESTIMONY FROM.

01:14:55.123 --> 01:14:56.925
OUR REPRESENTATIVES BIG CITIES

01:14:56.992 --> 01:14:58.126
AND SMALL.

01:14:58.193 --> 01:14:59.761
RURAL COUNTIES AND URBAN.

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:03.498
I AND ALL WALKS OF LIFE BUSINESS

01:15:03.565 --> 01:15:05.734
TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES.

01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:07.202
AND I THINK THAT --

01:15:07.269 --> 01:15:08.604
REASON WHY WE'RE SEEN LOCAL

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:09.872
GOVERNMENT SUPPORT THIS IS

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:11.240
BECAUSE THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT

01:15:11.306 --> 01:15:12.608
WILL WORK FOR THEM.

01:15:12.674 --> 01:15:13.709
AND WHAT WE HEARD --

01:15:13.775 --> 01:15:15.310
INCENTER MORLOCK WAS AT THIS

01:15:15.377 --> 01:15:16.612
SAME HEARING THE SAME JOINT

01:15:16.678 --> 01:15:18.680
HEARING LOSS ANGELES THAT THERE

01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:20.549
IS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP.

01:15:20.616 --> 01:15:21.183
FROM THE DISSOLUTION OF

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:24.253
REDEVELOPMENT IN A RICE --

01:15:24.319 --> 01:15:25.921
ADDRESS CORRELATION IN A RISING

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:27.923
STATE.

01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:29.424
WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE

01:15:29.491 --> 01:15:31.126
ABSOLUTE CRISIS THAT WE HAVE OF

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:32.261
THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION

01:15:32.327 --> 01:15:36.398
AFFORDABLE HOMES IS SEEN BETWEEN?

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:36.965
TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY TWENTY

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:37.900
FIVE AND THE MODERATE.

01:15:37.966 --> 01:15:39.835
LOW IN VERY LOW CATEGORIES WE'RE

01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:41.069
NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO GET THOSE

01:15:41.136 --> 01:15:42.771
BUILT WITHOUT AN ONGOING REVENUE

01:15:42.838 --> 01:15:45.040
SOURCE FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES

01:15:45.107 --> 01:15:45.340
[inaudible]

01:15:45.407 --> 01:15:48.577
I ONE OF THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCES

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:50.412
WHEN IT COMES TO OPPORTUNITIES

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:52.447
OWNS IN THIS BILL IS AT OR

01:15:52.514 --> 01:15:55.350
MANDATING THAT 50% 50%.

01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:57.152
OF ALL FINDING HAS TO GO TOWARDS

01:15:57.219 --> 01:15:58.287
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT IS A

01:15:58.353 --> 01:16:00.422
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FROM WHAT WE

01:16:00.489 --> 01:16:01.156
SAW.

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:03.592
IN PREVIOUS ITERATIONS OF WHAT

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:05.127
FOLKS CALLED REDEVELOPMENT SO WE

01:16:05.193 --> 01:16:06.495
GOT TO PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR

01:16:06.561 --> 01:16:08.096
MOUTH IS IN THIS CRISIS.

01:16:08.163 --> 01:16:09.464
THE REASON WHY WE ADVANCE STATE

01:16:09.531 --> 01:16:11.099
OVERSIGHT IS BECAUSE LET'S BE

01:16:11.166 --> 01:16:13.669
HONEST ARE THERE WERE A FEW NOT

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:15.003
VERY MANY BUT THERE ARE A FEW

01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:16.138
BAD ACTORS.

01:16:16.204 --> 01:16:17.673
WHO GAME THE REDEVELOPMENT

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:21.543
SYSTEM AND WE WANT TO BE A LEARN

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:22.811
FROM THOSE PREVIOUS MISTAKES?

01:16:22.878 --> 01:16:24.246
THAT IS WHY WE'RE GONNA HAVE

01:16:24.313 --> 01:16:25.681
DIRECT STATE OVERSIGHT.

01:16:25.747 --> 01:16:27.549
OVER THESE FUNDS AND WHICH

01:16:27.616 --> 01:16:28.951
PROJECTS ARE GONNA BE APPROVED

01:16:29.017 --> 01:16:30.419
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY NOT

01:16:30.485 --> 01:16:31.286
APPROVED --

01:16:31.353 --> 01:16:32.421
AND IT'S ABOUT PUTTING

01:16:32.487 --> 01:16:34.790
SAFEGUARDS IN TO ENSURE THAT WE

01:16:34.856 --> 01:16:36.091
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:37.726
TO GET THE JOB DONE ESPECIALLY

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:38.427
WHEN IT COMES TO AFFORDABLE

01:16:38.493 --> 01:16:39.261
HOUSING.

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:40.996
AND THERE ARE STRATEGIC OFF

01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:43.231
FRANCE WAS IN THAT BILL SO WHEN

01:16:43.298 --> 01:16:44.032
WE DO HIT A SIGNIFICANT

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:45.567
RECESSION.

01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:46.702
IN A FISCAL EMERGENCY IS

01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:48.937
DECLARED --

01:16:49.004 --> 01:16:51.039
THAT FINDING SO THAT WE'RE NOT --

01:16:51.106 --> 01:16:52.507
IMPACTING --

01:16:52.574 --> 01:16:54.443
PUBLIC EDUCATION BY THE WAY

THE EFFECT OF THAT IF YOU JUST

01:29:29.964 --> 01:29:30.765
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THE

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:32.300
BUSINESSES BUT THINK ABOUT THE

01:29:32.366 --> 01:29:33.768
CITY OR THE COUNTY NOW YES THEY

01:29:33.835 --> 01:29:35.236
ARGUE THERE'S A COUPLE COUNTIES

01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:36.003
DON'T HAVE PERMITS.

01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:38.539
OKAY WE'RE SOLVING 98% OF THE

01:29:38.606 --> 01:29:40.174
PROBLEMS AND YOU KNOW IN TERMS

01:29:40.241 --> 01:29:41.709
OF THE SITUATION IN MOST CITIES

01:29:41.776 --> 01:29:43.377
DO AND ALL THESE PERMITS ARE

01:29:43.444 --> 01:29:44.679
REQUIRED IN CITIES.

01:29:44.746 --> 01:29:46.914
BUT THE REALITY IS WITH A COUPLE

01:29:46.981 --> 01:29:48.916
MORE LINES YOU KNOW INTEGRATED

01:29:48.983 --> 01:29:51.619
STATE LOCAL AND FEDERAL

01:29:51.686 --> 01:29:52.820
SITUATIONS.

01:29:52.887 --> 01:29:54.622
AND YOU KNOW JOKE AROUND WITH MY

01:29:54.689 --> 01:29:56.791
STAFF AND IF THE BUT YOU KNOW IF

01:29:56.858 --> 01:29:58.626
THERE COULD BE AN ARGUMENT WELL

01:29:58.693 --> 01:29:59.761
JUST A SHOULDN'T HAVE IT BE A

01:29:59.827 --> 01:30:02.430
BURDEN TO A CITY OR COUNTY.

01:30:02.497 --> 01:30:03.798
TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT A FEDERAL

01:30:03.865 --> 01:30:04.832
LAW ONE OF THE FEDERAL

01:30:04.899 --> 01:30:06.067
GOVERNMENT SAID EVERYBODY IN

01:30:06.134 --> 01:30:07.235
CALIFORNIA HAD TO WEAR BLUE

01:30:07.301 --> 01:30:09.270
SHIRTS IT MIGHT NOT BE RELEVANT.

01:30:09.337 --> 01:30:10.505
BUT THIS IS A LAW THAT'S

01:30:10.571 --> 01:30:12.807
ABSOLUTELY DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO

01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:15.409
LIABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:30:15.476 --> 01:30:16.744
THAT THEY'RE HAVING A BIG HEART

01:30:16.811 --> 01:30:19.480
ATTACK OVER SO IT SEEMS TO ME

01:30:19.547 --> 01:30:20.281
YOU KNOW YOU ALWAYS GET THE

01:30:20.348 --> 01:30:20.882
ARGUMENTS.

01:30:20.948 --> 01:30:22.517
THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE'VE ALL

01:30:22.583 --> 01:30:23.451
BEEN INVOLVED WITH FOR A LONG

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:25.153
TIME LOCAL GOVERNMENT --

01:30:25.219 --> 01:30:26.687
IT'S A NEW COST ALL WHAT'S NEW

01:30:26.754 --> 01:30:28.089
BURDEN BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH

01:30:28.156 --> 01:30:29.290
TO ME.

01:30:29.357 --> 01:30:33.995
THE BENEFIT OF THIS THING AND

01:30:34.061 --> 01:30:37.031
THE REASON IT MAKES SENSE LAWS.

01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:38.766
AT THE FRONT END OF A PERMIT

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:40.201
AGAIN NOT A FOUR COUNTIES THEY

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:42.003
DON'T HAVE PERMIT REQUIREMENTS

01:30:42.069 --> 01:30:43.204
FOR BUSINESS LICENSES.

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:45.339
BUT BUT MOST WITH EVERYBODY ELSE

01:30:45.406 --> 01:30:48.109
WE HAVE AND SECONDLY WE'VE WE'VE

01:30:48.176 --> 01:30:49.177
BASICALLY DEALT WITH A MUCH

01:30:49.243 --> 01:30:50.711
LARGER PROBLEM THAT ALSO AFFECTS

01:30:50.778 --> 01:30:51.946
THE LIABILITY OF LOCAL

01:30:52.013 --> 01:30:53.080
JURISDICTIONS.

01:30:53.147 --> 01:30:55.116
SO THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES A

01:30:55.183 --> 01:30:56.684
RICKY DID ESSENCE REQUIRES THOSE

01:30:56.751 --> 01:30:58.786
THINGS IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE IN IN

01:30:58.853 --> 01:31:00.221
ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE.

01:31:00.288 --> 01:31:01.689
AND QUITE FRANKLY PRETTY

01:31:01.756 --> 01:31:03.758
EFFECTIVE I THINK IN TRYING TO

01:31:03.825 --> 01:31:05.526
THINK THROUGH GOVERNMENT IN A

01:31:05.593 --> 01:31:07.328
WAY THAT INTEGRATES THESE VERY

01:31:07.395 --> 01:31:09.197
IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICIES AT

01:31:09.263 --> 01:31:10.398
EVERY LEVEL.

01:31:10.464 --> 01:31:12.099
AND I WOULD WRECK I WOULD

01:31:12.166 --> 01:31:13.901
SUGGEST THAT ONE OF THE GREAT

01:31:13.968 --> 01:31:15.803
CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AS X.

01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:17.171
THINGS RICK CELEBRATING AT THE

01:31:17.238 --> 01:31:18.372
RATE THEY ARE.

01:31:18.439 --> 01:31:20.508
AND WE IN GOVERNMENT ARE NOT AS

01:31:20.575 --> 01:31:22.443
EXHILARATING AS QUICKLY IS TO

01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:24.745
TRY TO CREATE THE THE CUSTOMER

01:31:24.812 --> 01:31:25.613
EXPERIENCE THE BUSINESSES

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:26.414
WHATEVER.

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:27.849
EASIER WE SEE ALL THIS NEW

01:31:27.915 --> 01:31:29.884
TECHNOLOGY DOING THAT THIS IS A

01:31:29.951 --> 01:31:31.285
PLACE WHERE.

01:31:31.352 --> 01:31:32.653
SOMEBODY MIGHT NOT NEED NO THEY

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:34.121
NEED THE PERMIT RIGHT AND THEN

01:31:34.188 --> 01:31:35.156
THE GAULS AND SOMEBODY COMES

01:31:35.223 --> 01:31:38.092
AFTER IN LOS ANGELES IS ONLY.

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:41.262
FIVE INVESTIGATORS FOR WHAT.

01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:41.829
SIXTY THOUSAND SIX THOUSAND

01:31:41.896 --> 01:31:43.197

01:31:47.335 --> 01:31:48.102
ANY EVENT.

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:48.736
THE POINT IS THAT IT MAKES IT

01:31:48.803 --> 01:31:49.604
EVEN EASIER IN MY JUDGMENT IS

01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:51.005
MUCH AS WE CAN INTEGRATE THESE

01:31:51.072 --> 01:31:52.640
REQUIREMENTS AND PARTICULARLY

01:31:52.707 --> 01:31:53.875

THAT'S SO IMPORTANT AND AS SUCH

01:31:55.943 --> 01:31:57.445
IMPACT ON ALL THE PARTIES

01:31:57.511 --> 01:31:58.779

ROLLING UNDER THE PERMIT THAT IS

01:33:11.786 --> 01:33:12.353
THE ONLY OBLIGATION WITH THIS

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:12.987
BILL --

01:33:13.054 --> 01:33:14.322
SECOND I JUST WANT TO ILLUSTRATE

01:33:14.388 --> 01:33:16.057
WHY THIS BILL IS IS IS REALLY

01:33:16.123 --> 01:33:21.195

01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:22.363
GREAT JOB --

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:23.497
SO WHEN A RIVER BECOMES OUR

01:33:23.564 --> 01:33:24.699
WATER WAY BECOMES TOO POLLUTED --

01:33:24.765 --> 01:33:25.833
THE REGIONAL BOARDS SET WHAT'S

01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:27.568

REGIONAL BOARD WILL DO IS ASSESS

01:33:30.638 --> 01:33:32.673
WHAT IS THE LIMIT OF THE AMOUNT

01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:34.241
OF LET'S JUST SAY METALS.

01:33:34.308 --> 01:33:35.876
WE CAN PUT IN THE RIVER --

01:33:35.943 --> 01:33:37.712
WITHOUT IMPAIRING IT AND SO WE

01:33:37.778 --> 01:33:39.046
COME UP WITH THAT LOAD LIMIT AND

01:33:39.113 --> 01:33:40.114
THEY FIGURE OUT EVERYONE IN THE

01:33:40.181 --> 01:33:41.649
WATERSHED THAT IS WORSE THAT IS

01:33:41.716 --> 01:33:43.784
DISCHARGING INTO THAT RIVER SO

01:33:43.851 --> 01:33:45.152
LET'S TAKE A LATE --

01:33:45.219 --> 01:33:46.921
THEY'VE A METALS TEAM DEAL.

01:33:46.988 --> 01:33:48.956
SO THEY SETTLE A LOAD TARGET AND

01:33:49.023 --> 01:33:49.790
THEN THEY FIGURE OUT EVERYONE

01:33:49.857 --> 01:33:51.292
THIS THIS CHARGING IN THERE AND

01:33:51.359 --> 01:33:53.227

01:34:03.604 --> 01:34:05.039

THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:07.975
THE MUNICIPALITIES ARE --

01:34:08.042 --> 01:34:09.810
TO COMPLY WITH THIS PERMIT WHICH

01:34:09.877 --> 01:34:11.879
JUST CREATES AN INEQUITABLE

01:34:11.946 --> 01:34:13.314
SITUATION BUT ALSO WE'RE NEVER

01:34:13.381 --> 01:34:14.949
GOING TO GET THE WATER WAYS TO

01:34:15.016 --> 01:34:16.984
MEET THAT LOW TARGET IF 80% OF

01:34:17.051 --> 01:34:18.252
THE IN INDUSTRIES THAT ARE

01:34:18.319 --> 01:34:19.854

01:34:30.331 --> 01:34:32.366

01:38:10.884 --> 01:38:12.186
SIXTEEN SO A THIRD OF THE STATE

01:38:14.922 --> 01:38:16.490
A CURRENT BUSINESS LICENSE SO

01:38:16.557 --> 01:38:17.958
THEY WOULDN'T FALL.

01:38:18.025 --> 01:38:19.460
UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS

01:38:19.526 --> 01:38:21.128
BILL IN ADDITION THERE ARE

01:38:21.195 --> 01:38:22.563
NUMBER OF OTHER COUNTIES THAT WE

01:38:22.630 --> 01:38:24.331
ONLY REQUIRE A BUSINESS LICENSE

01:38:24.398 --> 01:38:25.899
FOR CERTAIN ACTIVITIES --

01:38:25.966 --> 01:38:27.368
THAT THEY WANT TO HAVE

01:38:27.434 --> 01:38:29.203
ADDITIONAL REGULATORY AUTHORITY

01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:30.871

01:38:36.477 --> 01:38:37.278
EXAMPLE --

01:38:37.344 --> 01:38:38.879
SO A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES THAT

01:38:38.946 --> 01:38:40.848
MIGHT NOT FALL UNDER THE

01:38:40.914 --> 01:38:42.349
INDUSTRIAL STORMWATER PERMIT.

01:38:42.416 --> 01:38:45.419
I AND THEN FINALLY THERE ARE

01:38:45.486 --> 01:38:48.689
ALSO A NUMBER OF COUNTIES --

01:38:48.756 --> 01:38:52.226
THAT HAVE AID MUNICIPAL --

01:38:52.293 --> 01:38:54.228
EXCUSE ME A MINISTERIAL PROCESS

01:38:54.295 --> 01:38:57.264
TO ISSUE A BUSINESS LICENSE AND

01:38:57.331 --> 01:38:58.432
THAT IS ESSENTIALLY AN OVER THE

01:38:58.499 --> 01:38:59.900
COUNTER PROCESS AS YOU ALL KNOW

01:38:59.967 --> 01:39:01.669
BUT COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:39:01.735 --> 01:39:02.803
IT REQUIRES THE BUSINESS TO FILL

01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:04.238
OUT AN APPLICATION.

01:39:04.305 --> 01:39:05.873
SUBMIT A FEE --

01:39:05.939 --> 01:39:07.441
AND PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE

01:39:07.508 --> 01:39:10.411
PAPERWORK AND THAT COUNTY THEN --

01:39:10.477 --> 01:39:13.414
ISSUES THE PERMIT SO THAT WE DO --

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:15.149
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO STAFF A

EFFORTS --

01:39:19.353 --> 01:39:20.554
WE DO THINK THAT THE WAY IT'S

01:39:20.621 --> 01:39:21.822
CURRENTLY DRAFTED IT WOULD

01:39:21.889 --> 01:39:23.257
CHANGE THAT MINISTERIAL PROCESS

01:39:23.324 --> 01:39:24.825
AND IT REQUIRES TO ROUTE THAT

01:39:24.892 --> 01:39:26.593
PERMIT TO AN APPROPRIATE STAFF

01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:27.695
PERSON THAT COULD THEN.

01:39:27.761 --> 01:39:29.630
VERIFY -- WE

01:39:29.697 --> 01:39:32.866

DEMONSTRATING THAT THEY HAVE

01:39:37.004 --> 01:39:38.038
THAT PERMANENT --

01:39:38.105 --> 01:39:39.440
IN PLACE SO THAT WE CAN KEEP

01:39:39.506 --> 01:39:41.175
THAT MEANT MINISTERIAL PROCESS

01:39:41.241 --> 01:39:42.876
IN PLACE AND NOT REALLY GOES AND

01:39:42.943 --> 01:39:44.845
SPEAKS TO SORT OF THE CUSTOMER

01:39:44.912 --> 01:39:47.047

01:39:48.415 --> 01:39:49.817
INDUSTRIAL STORMWATER PERMIT

01:39:49.883 --> 01:39:51.118

01:39:55.222 --> 01:39:56.323
THING.

01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:58.258
THE ONE STOP SHOP FOR A BUSINESS

01:39:58.325 --> 01:39:59.493
