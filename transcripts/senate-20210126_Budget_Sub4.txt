PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL AND PATIENT TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES SO THAT THEY CAN BE HEARD. IN TODAY'S HEARING WE WILL REVIEW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND WORKERS. THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE GRANT SUPPORT TO SMALL BUSINESSES IMPACTED BY COVERED NINETEEN AND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY RESTRICTIONS. FOR THE LOW INCOME WORKERS THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS WHICH CONSISTS OF TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE A SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR REFUND. TO TAXPAYERS WHO RECEIVED THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN TAX YEAR. AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBER FILERS WHO RECEIVED THE CREDIT FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TAX YEAR. SMALL BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY THE IMPACT OF THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC. AS THE AGENDA POINTS OUT AN OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY SHUTTERED AND MORE THAN 40% A CALIFORNIA'S SMALL BUSINESSES REPORT REQUIRING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE MONTHS AHEAD. THE PANDEMIC HAS ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED LOW WAGE WARNER EARNERS. MANY LOW WAGE WORKERS WERE EMPLOYED IN THE VERY INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN HIT THE HARDEST. ADDITIONALLY WORKERS THAT FILE THEIR TAXES WITH INDIVIDUAL TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OF A MAJORITY OF THE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO DATE. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE EFFORTS TO IMMEDIATELY PROVIDE RELIEF TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE SORELY NEEDED AND MUCH APPRECIATED. THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO ACT QUICKLY TO ENSURE WE DO OUR PART TO GET RELIEF TO BUSINESSES AND WORKERS MOST IN NEED. TODAY'S INFORMATIONAL HEARING IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR THE DETAILS OF WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING AND TO HEAR FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND CONSTITUENTS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THE LEGISLATURE DOES ACT. WE'RE DOING SO IN A MANNER THAT MAXIMIZES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS CRITICAL STATE SUPPORT. WE WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR ROLLING OUT THE SMALL BUSINESS GRANT PROGRAM PHASE ONE ABOUT A MONTH AGO. WHICH GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS IN REAL TIME ABOUT LESSONS LEARNED AND GOALS AND METRICS SO WE CAN BE. PREPARED FOR FACE TO. ADD MORE RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES. AS I INDICATED TO YOU PREVIOUSLY WE WILL TAKE NO VOTES TODAY THIS IS ONLY AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THESE TWO PROPOSALS. BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO ASK CENTER NIELSEN IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE A STATEMENT. IF I MAY BE OUT OF HERE YES. AS WE COMMENCE THE DELIBERATIONS ON THIS BUDGET. THERE'S AN OBSERVATION IN GENERAL THAT I MUST MAKE. THERE SEEMS TO BE A TREND OF ADMINISTRATIONS PEARLS AND PARTICULARLY THIS ONE. TO SUBMIT TO THE LEGISLATURE BOLD IDEAS. UNDEFINED. AND THE ADMONISHMENT TO THE LEGISLATORS AS WELL TRUST US WE'LL WORK IT ALL OUT. WILL HANDLE THE DETAILS JUST AUTHORIZED THE EXPENDITURES. ALMOST A BLANK CHECK AS FACT WHAT THEY'RE ASKING. AND THAT REALLY DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OBVIOUSLY THE TRAVESTY THAT'S OCCURRING IN GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW. OUR IN PART THE RESULT OF THE LEGISLATURE NOT INSISTING ON SUCH MEASURES GOVERNING THE BUDGETS AND THE ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION OF THE AGENCIES OF STATE GOVERNMENT. IT IS TIME FOR US TO THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO REST THAT AUTHORITY BACK INTO THE HANDS OF THE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES. WE WILL HAVE TO BE HAPPILY WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO FILL IN THE BLANKS BUT I'M NOT SUPPORTING ANYMORE THESE BIG NEW ORGANIZATIONS. OR IF YOU WILL NEW AGENCIES BEING CREATED. WITHOUT ANY INSISTENCE ON THE LIBERALS AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY AND THEY'RE JUST SIMPLY IS NO TRUST THAT THE AGENCIES WILL GET IT RIGHT BECAUSE CLEARLY THEY HAVE IT SO IT'S OUR JOB AS MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE THE VERY FIRST. IN OVERSEEING AND THEN RIDING INTO THE TRAILER BILL IS VERY SPECIFIC MEASURABLES AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN. WE'RE GOING TO START WITH OUR FIRST. PANEL SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF GRANTS I'D LIKETO INVITE FROM G. DIMITRA CHIEF OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WELCOME THANK YOU- I WOULD DEFER TO MY CLIENT AS MY COLLEAGUE ABOUT THIS MONTH I'M GO BASE TO START THIS DISCUSSION. VERY GOOD. IDEAS ABOUT BOOTHS MINE THE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE WELCOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR AND THANK YOU ALL FOR. GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS PROGRAM IT'S BEEN- BUT IF IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE AS WELL AS REPRESENT HELLO S. B. A. THE CALIFORNIA OFFICES SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATING GO BASED ON THIS REQUEST OF THE GOVERNOR'S ADDS FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE CALIFORNIA RELIEF GRANT. AT AS YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN DEPLOYING THE INITIAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM AND REQUEST AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FOR GRANTS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES BOTH FOR PROFIT FOUR POINT ONE MILLIONSTRONG IN THE STATE- AND NONPROFITS APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND STRONG IN THE STATE. 'M ALL IMPACTED BY CODE NINETEEN I KNOW SENATORS ARE YOU PROBABLY HAVE WITNESSED IN YOUR OWN DISTRICTS THAT SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN SEVERELY IMPACTED BY KOBE NINETEEN ESPECIALLY THOSE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE RESULTING HEALTH GUIDANCE AND CLOSURES- AS WELL AS THE CHANGING MARKETPLACE AND CONSUMER DEMANDS- STUDIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY ESTIMATED YOU KNOW THIRD CLASS OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE AT RISK OF CLOSURE. HIGHER FOR BIG PEOPLE OF COLOR I WITH THE RECENT STUDY BY SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY WHO I KNOW YOU'RE HEARING FROM LATER TODAY ESTIMATING 41% OF AFRICAN AMERICAN FIRMS ARE AT RISK OF CLOSURE- YET OUR ECONOMY IS LARGELY DEPENDENT. ON THE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO EMPLOY NEARLY HALF OF OUR WORKFORCE AND CREATE TWO THIRDS OF OUR NET NEW JOBS- SO GOING INTO THIS PANDEMIC THEY WERE ALREADY FACING LOW CASH FLOW LEVELS IT WAS ESTIMATED BY J. P. MORGAN CHASE THAT NEARLY HALF HAD ONLY TWO WEEKS OF CASH FLOW. PANDEMIC A SO CLEARLY ARE ARE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO ARE ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY IS AS WE SAY OUR OUR I NEED OF OUR SUPPORT DURING THIS TIME OF AT NINETEEN SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN ADAPTING AND PIVOTING YOU SEEN IN YOUR COMMUNITIES REALLY CREATIVELY ATTEMPTING TO MANAGE AND DISASTER FOR TEN MONTHS. EXPERIENCING DROPS IN REVENUES RISING DEBTS- AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE MARKET PLACES AS WELL THAT'S A ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THE THROUGH THIS ALL THAT THEY'VE WANTED GRANTS. NOT LOANS TO CARRY THE THROUGH THE PENNED. AND THE SECOND CRISIS- MY- IN HIS. ADMINISTERING CALIFORNIA RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM STRUCTURE BASED ON STUDIES OF NATIONAL AND LOCAL BEST PRACTICES THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS GRANT PROGRAMS DEPLOYED ACROSS THE NATION- THAT WE HAVE BEEN TRACKING- THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS MANY IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL- AND WE- LEARNED FROM THOSE NETWORKS. LESSONS LEARNED AS WELL AS- INFORMED OUR PROGRAM DESIGN BASED ON ON THOSE KEY BEST PRACTICES- WE AS WELL WORKED WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THAT INITIAL PROGRAM DESIGN WITH PRIORITIES AROUND. BALANCING SIMPLICITY AND EASE OF USE WITH OVERSIGHT AND CONTROLS TO MITIGATE ANY FRAUD OR AND CHALLENGES IN THE SYSTEM- AS WELL EMPHASIZING SPEED GETTING THESE GRANTS ON THE GROUND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I'M QUICKLY SCALING ACROSS THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WOULD HAVE THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO SURVIVE AND- AND SERVE AS A BRIDGE UNTIL ADDITIONAL FEDERAL RELIEF FOR OTHER PROGRAMS COULD BE AND PUT INTO PLACE. I WE HAVE BEEN PRIORITIZING. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM THE MOST IMPACTED BUSINESSES LOOKING AT GEOGRAPHIC IMPACT OF THE CODE NINETEEN GUIDANCE AS WELL AS INDUSTRY AND- A HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED STATUS OUR MOST VULNERABLE BUSINESSES IN OUR STATE. AS THE DATA HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY'RE AT. RISK IN ADDITION TO THAT THE PROGRAM DOES I WAS FOCUSED ON LEVERAGING THE EXISTING STATE RESOURCES- OUR BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO THE CALIFORNIA NETWORK OF SMALL BUSINESS CENTERS- AS WELL AS FRANKLY THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICES ALL CENTERS OF INFORMATION. AND RESOURCE TO SMALL BUSINESSES. WE KNOW THAT CONNECTION TO RESOURCES IS A HUGE CHALLENGE PRE PANDEMIC ENTERING PANDEMIC. AND WANTED TO ENSURE THAT WE REALLY WERE ABLE TO PARTNER IN THIS PROCESS WITH A NETWORK OF STRONG PARTNERS TO STRENGTHEN THE ECOSYSTEM LONG TERM AND LOOK TO OUR RECOVERY AS WELL. AND SO THAT SMALL BUSINESSES COULD BE CONNECTED TO PARTNERS ON THE GROUND FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BEYOND THE GRANT PROGRAM ITSELF- WE AT YEAR END AND FINALLY JUST THAT THE PROBE. WOULD NOT BE FIRST COME FIRST. MOST OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN AYE IT'S CREATED A LOT OF CHALLENGES FOR THE SMALLEST OF SMALLER THE MOST AT RISK TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO THE PROGRAM IN TIME. AND SO IMPORTANTLY THIS WAS AND NOT TO BE A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS PROGRAM. AT NOR ROLLING BASIS AT LEAD L'INDUSTRIE AS AN INTERMEDIARY THAT WAS AWARDED BY A COMPETITIVE BID PROCESS- TO HELP ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM. A SELECTION COMMITTEE WAS WAS THAT DEPLOYED TO- SELECT COMPETITIVELY ONE OF THE FINALISTS FOR THE INTERMEDIARY. POSITION L'INDUSTRIE IS A CDFI- ALSO RAN OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS ACROSS THE NATION- THERE WERE ONE OF THE LARGEST C. DIFF ISLANDERS IN SOME OF THE KEY FEDERAL PROGRAMS. AND SO HAS A HISTORY AND A PERFORMANCE HISTORY THAT WE- ARE PROUD TO PARTNER WITH AS WELL AS THEIR COMMITMENTS TO MISSION IS A COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL. INSTITUTION CDFI. COMMITTED TO HELP UNDERSTOOD SMALL BUSINESSES. WE WE AS WELL WE'RE PLEASED TO PARTNER WITH FIVE HUNDRED DIRECT AND INDIRECT PARTNERS ON THE GROUND- IN SO IN ADDITION TO OUR SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER NETWORKS ARE WOMEN'S BUSINESS IN A NETWORK THAT IS FUNDED ALREADY BY THE STATE TO- DEPLOY RESOURCES AND COMMUNITY- WE WENT BEYOND THAT TO OTHER C. D. F. I.'S OTHER NONPROFIT BASED ON ORGANIZATIONS CHAMBERS EXCEPT REST OF THAT WE CAN GET TO AS MANY BUSINESSES ON THE GROUND SCALE QUICKLY. EFFICIENTLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ANOTHER ADDED BENEFIT OF COURSE OF WORKING WITH THE CDFI SAID THEY HAVE THAT YOU KNOW FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONAL- GET A CAPACITY TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE IMPLEMENTING CONTROLS- INCLUDING YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO VERIFY TAX RETURNS DO BACKGROUND CHECKS WITH CLEAR AND SECRETARY OF STATE- YOU DO THAT THAT YOU KNOW VERIFY YOUR BANK ACCOUNTS AND DO CREDIT CHECKS OF THOSE THOSE THINGS WERE IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDS WERE ACTUALLY GETTING TO THE BUSINESSES THAT WE WERE HOPING. TO SERVE BASED ON ALL OF THESE PRIORITIES AND FOCUSES OF THIS PROGRAM- AND THE STRENGTH OF OUR INTERMEDIARY PARTNERS WE HAVE SEEN SUCCESSES IN ROUND ONE OF THE PROGRAM TODAY I KNOW THAT THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL REALLY HELP US BETTER MEET THIS HUGE I'M NOT AND YOU DEMAND THAT WE'RE SEEING ON THE GROUND- AS YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE ANNOUNCES PROGRAM IN NOVEMBER THIRTIETH WE OPEN THE GRANT PORTAL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BY DECEMBER THIRTIETH- APPLICATIONS FOR ROUND ONE OPENED. I AND HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO HELPING AS MANY AS POSSIBLE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THROUGH THE SYSTEM OVER THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND APPLICATIONS WERE RECEIVED- IN LARGE PART THANKS TO THIS NETWORK I REFERENCED OF PARTNERS THEIR DAILY WEBINARS IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES OVER A HUNDRED WEAPONIZED TO DATE IN OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND BUSINESSES TRYING TO DATE BASED ON ROUND ONE WE CAN SEE THAT THE MONEY IS ACTUALLY GETTING INTO THE HANDS OF IMPACTED BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE. OVER THREE QUARTERS OF THE GRANTS AWARDED TO DATE HAVE GONE TO DISADVANTAGED OR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TWO THIRDS TO HIGHLY IMPACTED. INDUSTRIES AND WE HAVE SEEN EQUITY ACROSS THE STATE. OF COURSE ALL OF THE STATE BEING AND A STATE HOME ORDER THE TIME. SO WHILE WE HAVE SEEN THESE SUCCESSES- YOU KNOW ALL THOSE ENGAGED HAVE CONTINUALLY MADE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PROCESS AND WILL CONTINUE IN THAT SPIRIT. OF ITERATION AS WE WALK INTO ROUND TWO WHICH WILL OPEN ON FEBRUARY SECOND. THE DISPLAY THE REMAINING HALF OF THE INITIAL A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM- SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT IN AND WANT TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE TO- THE BROWN ONE PROCESS AND HOW IT'S GONE- ON TECHNOLOGY IMPORTANTLY REMEMBER THAT THIS IS NOT FIRST COME FIRST SERVE. A LOT OF PROGRAMS HIT A CERTAIN NUMBER AND SHUT DOWN- OR- YOU KNOW OR JUST LIMITED BECAUSE OF CAPACITY. SO WE KEPT THIS OPEN NO MATTER WHAT SO THAT BUSINESSES FELT THAT THEY HAD A FAIR SHOT TO ACCESS THE FUNDS- AND DEBT AND ABOUT BECAUSE OF THAT- DAY ONE WITH THAT MASSIVE DEMAND THAT WE HAD WE HAD OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SUCCESSFUL APPLICANTS GO THROUGH ON DAY ONE ALONE- AND HAPPIER TENS OF THOUSANDS TRY TO WALK IN THE FRONT DOOR AT THE SAME TIME- WE ACTUALLY. SPLIT THE SYSTEM INTO- PROCESSES ONE APPLYING TO GET EVERYBODY IN THE FRONT DOOR TO UPLOADING DOCUMENTS TO THEN ALLOW FOR. OF FOLKS TO COME BACK AND REVISIT THEIR APPLICATION IN THE FUTURE- YOU KNOW WHILE THIS CREATED SOME. CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF USE OUR PARTNERS ON THE GROUND WERE ABLE TO WALK FOLKS THROUGH- THE PROCESS AND STILL GET THESE GREAT RESULTS- WE KNOW WE'VE SEEN ON OUR REGION MARKETING THAT OUR PARTNERS HAVE DEVELOPED A THE WEAPON OURS AS I MENTIONED- PROMOTED EXTENSIVELY ON SOCIAL MEDIA. EXTENSIVE EARNED MEDIA AND OFFERED MULTIPLE LANGUAGES- BUT WE'VE CONTINUALLY ADDED MORE VIDEOS AS WE'VE GONE ALONG. AND WE FEEL STRONG IN ROUND TWO THAT WILL HAVE THE CAN IN ADDITIONAL- TRANSLATED DOCUMENT. EXCUSE ME TRANSLATED DOCUMENTS TO HELP OUR SMALL BUSINESSES ACCESS THIS PROGRAM- WE'VE SEEN L'INDUSTRIE RESPONDS THROUGHOUT THIS BY ADOPTING- INCREASING THEIR CAPACITY THE- EXPANDING THEIR CALL CENTER SERVICES. WHEN HIT. MASSIVE- OVERLOAD OF THIS IS. AND- WE'RE PLEASE. WITH WITH THE RESULTS SHOWING ALL THOSE DELIBERATE ITERATIVE ITERATIVE CHANGES THAT WE'VE MADE THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES IN THIS PROGRAM- AS I'VE SAID THE DEMAND WAS HUGE OVER THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND APPLICATIONS. RECEIVED YOU KNOW AND WHILE THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL HELP US NEEDS SOME OF THAT DEMAND OF COURSE YOU KNOW WE CANNOT MEET ALSO IMPORTANTLY. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE REACHING THE MOST IMPACTED BUSINESSES AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO- WE'VE REVIEWED THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IS REPORT. AND HAPPY TO IN IN NOW JUST. DEFER THE TIME TO ANSWERING SOME OF THOSE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. AS WE DIVE INTO THE PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE USE OF THOSE FUNDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON. BY THE MAKE A PRESENTATION ARE YOU JUST HERE FOR TO ANSWER QUESTIONS TECHNICAL QUESTIONS WE'RE JUST HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU SENATOR ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ONE WILL MOVE ON TO- BRAND WHETHER FOR THE SENIOR FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE FOR COMMENTS. WELCOME THANK YOU THIS IS BRIAN WEATHERFORD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE PREPARED- AS THE ADMINISTRATION MENTIONED ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN HAND OUT WITH WITH INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON OUR ON OUR WEBSITE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND FOLLOWING ITS AT ALLINA DOT CA DOT GOV- THERE IS A LOT OF AKRON IN THE HANDOUT SAID JUST TURNING TO PAGE SIX. WE MENTIONED SOME OF THE CONCERNS ON THIS PAGE THAT WERE RAISED BY APPLICANTS AND PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS AND THE ADMINISTRATION- BEGAN TO ADDRESSING THESE CONCERNS IN THE PRESENTATION- WE JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT ESTABLISHING A BRAND NEW PROGRAM OFTEN INVOLVES ON FIFTEEN IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES AND SO SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT- WE NOTE AND THAT OTHERS HAVE NOTED- MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES. HOWEVER SOME STAKEHOLDERS ALSO FELT THAT BETTER COMMUNICATION AND NOT REACH FROM THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE THIRD PARTY VENDOR- WELL THE PROGRAM IS BEING IMPLEMENTED COULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE POTENTIAL ISSUES BEFORE. THE PROGRAM BEGAN. A TURNING THE PAGE SEVEN. THE ARMS THE LEGISLATURE IN CONSIDERING HOW TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL STATE RELIEF TO BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS- SHOULD- TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE TARGET THESE FUNDS TO THOSE ENTITIES THAT WERE MOST WE'D LIKE TO KNOW THE TARGETING IS IMPORTANT FOR TWO REASONS. THE FIRST THE GRANDSON LIKELY TO REACH ALL ELIGIBLE ENTITIES AS PROGRAMS CURRENTLY DESIGNED- SO WE ESTIMATE THAT THESE ON THE FIRST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS ALLOCATED IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY WILL PROVIDE FOR BETWEEN THIRTY THOUSAND AND FIFTY THOUSAND GRANTS. AND EXPANDING THE PROGRAM BY FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WOULD UNDERSTANDABLY ROUGH THE DOUBLE NUMBER OF GRANTS THAT CAN BE- AWARDED AND- NONETHELESS IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT MANY OF THE ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE A GRANT AS WE ESTIMATE THERE ROUGHLY- TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ACTIVE SMALL BUSINESSES AND- MOST IMPACTED INDUSTRIES ALONE IN THE STATE. AND OBVIOUSLY WITH US SINCE SINCE WE PREPARE THIS FOR THAT MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND APPLICANTS APPLY TO THE PROGRAM ED IN JUST THE FIRST ROUND. IN ADDITION TARGETING COULD LIMIT DUPLICATION- THEY'RE TARGETING TO LIMIT DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS SO. THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS- ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO ALL BUSINESSES- WE KNOW BUSINESSES THEN DEFAULTED ON PREVIOUS SB A LOANS OR THAT ARE UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS MAY BE INELIGIBLE FOR. THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS AND SO THE STATE COULD TARGET THE MOST AND IMPACTED IN. INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. AS AN EXAMPLE OF BETTER TARGETING NOW THE CALIFORNIA RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM DOES INCLUDE- TARGETING. AND- THAT SHOULD BE ON UNDERLINE- WE DO KNOW AT THIS POINT IT'S IN FACT THIS EFFECTIVENESS AND CLEAR AS WE HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW ANY- OF THE AGGRESSIVE BEEN AWARDED OR THE DETAILS OF THE CONTRACT. SO. IN ADDITION- BECAUSE BECAUSE WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH EXACTLY HOW THESE OTHER SPARTANS BEING RUN. ON BASED ON COMMISSION THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED TO US TODAY. WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS ABOUT HOW AND WHETHER THE STATE OR THE THIRD PARTY VENDOR. WILL VERIFY THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED BY THE APPLICANTS IN PLACE- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT PROCESS HE'S BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO DETECT FRAUD. SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD- WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER PROVIDING ONE TIME FINANCIAL RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS THAT WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC PROVIDED THOSE FUNDS CAN BE APPROPRIATELY TARGETED. AND WHETHER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS THE BEST WAY TO DO SO IS NOT YET CLEAR- YOU KNOW THE INITIAL TIME AND PROCESS FOR AWARDING THE GRANTS WAS ARGUABLY JUSTIFIED GIVEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT OF THE TIME. ON THE OTHER HAND WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RECENTLY MAKING A SECOND ROUND OF TPG LOANS AVAILABLE AND- FINANCIALLY FOR FURTHER ASSISTANCE FORTHCOMING YOU THINK IT MAY BE PRUDENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DEFER ACTION. ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL UNTIL THE FOLLOWING STEPS CAN BE TAKEN. FIRST WE UNDERSTAND DATA HAS BEEN COLLECTED ON THIS PROGRAM BUT IT HASN'T BEEN BROADLY SHARED WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE SO WE THINK THIS ON INFORMATION BUT ONLY NEEDS TO BE MADE- MORE TRANSPARENTLY AVAILABLE BUT ALSO- EVALUATED- TO FIND WAYS TO. IMPROVE THE PROGRAM ALTHOUGH IT IS- REASSURING TO HEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS IT'S- CONTINUALLY MAKING IMPROVEMENTS BASED ON ON THE DATA BUT BECAUSE TO BRING IN- PARTNERS AND- THE LEGISLATURE AND- AT LEAST A TO SOME EXTENT I GUESS THAT IS HAPPENING BUT- WE HAVEN'T REALLY. BEEN INVOLVED OURSELVES SO-IN ADDITION TO ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY- THE RESEARCHERS LEGISLATURE CAREFULLY CONSIDER- OTHER QUESTIONS THAT WE LIST ON PAGE NINE OF OUR HAND- SO GIVEN THE STATE'S MORE LIMITED CAPACITY FOR- FOR FINANCIAL AND FISCAL ASSISTANCE- AND- THE LIMITED ROLE IN GENERAL OTHER WAYS TO COMPLEMENT AND NOT DUPLICATE FEDERAL EFFORTS. SECOND OR THE THIRD PARTY VENDORS PROCESSES TO ADEQUATELY VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF APPLICANTS IN THE ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION. ARE THEY ABLE TO- TO DO THAT- QUICKLY AND ACCURATELY AND PREVENT PRIVATE. THIRD SHOULD THE PROGRAM'S DEFINITION OF A SMALL BUSINESS ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENCES AMONG. DIFFERENT SECTORS OR SHOULD CONTINUE TO APPLY A SINGLE DEFINITION OF. ARE CURRENTLY IT'S TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IN ANNUAL REVENUES AT THE RIGHT DEFINITION AND- TO BE CONSIDERED MOVING FORWARD. A FOURTH SHOULD THE GRANT BE COUNTED AS TAXABLE INCOME SO WITHOUT ACTION THESE GRANTS WILL BE COUNTED AS TAX ONE COMPORT STATE TAX PURPOSES HOWEVER WE DO UNDERSTAND THE MINISTRATION IS LOOKING AT. MAKING THESE AREPUTTING FORTH LANGUAGE TO MAKE THESE TAX EXEMPT. AND LASTLY- WE QUESTION THE NEED FOR A SET ASIDE ONLY FOR CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS UNDOUBTEDLY MUSEUMS AND OTHER CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPACTED ENTITIES BUT AS SUCH. IT SEEMS UNREASONABLE THEY WOULD NECESSARILY ADDED THAT THEY WOULD RISE TO THE TOP AND- PROGRAM WHICH IS. BASED ON NEED SO IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR ON THAT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OR- THAT THERE'S A SPECIFIC NEED FOR A SET ASIDE. ON AND THAT'S THE END OF MY PREPARED REMARKS ON HAPPY TAKING QUESTIONS. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ON THAT THAT CONCLUDES THE- PRESENTATION IN REGARDS TO THE- TO THE PROGRAM I'M GONNA SEE IF WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE SECOND PART OF THIS. PARTICULAR PANEL- AND I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS- IS GOING TO BE TO- MISCUES MON AND- THE INITIAL ROLLOUT OF THE- THIS GRANT PROGRAM WAS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND THERE IT THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY. FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. REQUESTED CAN YOU CAN YOU TELL US. HOW YOU ENDED UP. DECIDING ON THAT NUMBER AND IF THERE'S A GOAL IN MIND IN TERMS OF HOW MANY BUSINESSES YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD. OVER WITH THAT AND- I MEAN I IS THAT IS THAT THE RIGHT NUMBER WE REALLY LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE MUCH LARGER GIVEN THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS THAT YOU RECEIVED. YES THE I MEAN NUMBER APPLICATION APPLICATIONS RECEIVED AS I SAID THAT I ACTUALLY COMPLETED- ELIGIBLE APPLICATIONS AT THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND- IT OVER FOR. A BILLION IN DEMAND B. B. S. YOU KNOW WE LOOKED AT OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WERE ROLLED OUT THE LARGEST PROGRAMS IN THE NATION TO PENNSYLVANIA- AS WELL AS- LOS ANGELES COUNTY- AND THAT YOUR ESTIMATED. THAT THE DEMANDS OF CALIFORNIA WE KNOW THAT WE COULD NOT FILL IT COMPLETELY BUT WE'RE HOPING TO BRIDGE. UNTIL ADDITIONAL FUNDS COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE AND FEDERAL LEVEL- I WILL KNOW THAT. YOU'RE REGARDLESS TEN MONTHS OF HAVING TO DEAL WITH THAT YOU KNOW THIS THIS PANDEMIC. EVEN IF EVEN IF THE BUSINESSES RECEIVED ANOTHER GRANT R. P. G. P. OR I'D ALL IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ENOUGH. TO SUSTAIN THEM FOR THOSE TEN MONTHS AND SO- YOU KNOW WITH ALL THOSE THINGS WERE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW SOME CHALLENGES IN BEING ABLE TO ACCESS- AND GET FORGIVENESS ON SME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS- IN THAT. THIS IS WHAT THE STATE'S CAPACITY COULD HANDLE OF COURSE THERE'S NO- THE NUMBERS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. FURTHER WITH THE NUMBERS ARE. ARE NOT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES OR A PROJECTION IT WAS IT'S REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET SOME RESOURCES I GUESS I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT- WON'T IT IT THE IN TOTAL IT'S A LITTLE OVER A BILLION DOLLARS AND I'M I'M TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF. A BILLION TWO BILLION THREE BILLION IS THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO IS WHEN YOU GO OUT WITH THE GRANT PROGRAM YOU GO OUT WITH YOU YOU SET UP EXPECTATIONS AND I'M WONDERING IF- IF YOU KNOW WE TOOK THAT INTO CONSIDERATION IN TERMS OF THEIR OF THE NUMBERS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING. AND I GUESS WHAT I REALLY WANT TO DO IS TO SAY HOW DO WE GET IT RIGHT SIZED- GIVEN. ALL THE OTHER OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE HERE AT THE STATE. AND THE DEMANDS ON THE MONEY WHICH WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE AN INTENSE. BUT I I'M I. I GUESS WHAT IWANT TO OF AVOID. IS WE KNEW THAT THE MONEY THAT WE PUT OUT FOR UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS IS GOING TO BE INSUFFICIENT- AND SO IT SETS UP EXPECTATIONS AND THEN 10% OF THE POPULATION GETS A CHECK IN THE RESTAURANT AND I'M TRYING TO AVOID. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE MAKE THAT. CALCULATION GIVEN WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW AND MOVING THIS PROGRAM FORWARD. YES I MEAN WE KNEW THAT THAT WOULD BE INSUFFICIENT. AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE DEMAND EVEN AND RON WENT ALONG AND SO. THEY'RE FOUR POINT ONE BUSINESSES IF YOU HAD IN THE NUMBER. WHICH ARE ALLEGED FIVE WILL C. THREES AND SEE SIX IS A BETTER. THERE ARE AND YOU KNOW AT LEAST FORTY. SO CLEARLY THIS IS AN AND OF THOSE OF COURSE REAL. AT TO FIVE AND- AN HIGHLY IN- THIS WAS NO ENOUGH. TO MEET. BUT IT WAS A HOPE TRY TO STAY. MANY INTEND UP TO. OF THE DEMAND- IF HE'S A- FUNDS ARE PRETTY. AND I KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF. WANTS TO ADD AN- FURTHER SUBJECT- SO THAT'S A GOOD. I THINK. YOU KNOW- I'M- WE KNOW THE DEMAND IS GREAT. AND YOU KNOW THE RACE. AREN'T LIMITED FROM WE CAN- SO IT'S YOU KNOW WITH WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OUT THE PROPOSED FUNDING IS. AND IT'S JUST THE WAY POINT FOR BILLION SPECIFIC TO SPOT. JUST SHOWS THE ADMIN- COME. TO UP THE EFFECT. BUSINESSES AS THEY GO THROUGH THIS TIME. TIME AND SO MUCH OF WE ARE PER. IS TO IT IMMEDIATELY ABOUT. TO GET THAT IMMEDIATE HELP. TO BUSINESS TO SET. THEM AND THEY- THIS IS ALSO GOING TO BE IN ADDITION TO THE ADDITIONAL UP. FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THAT BRIAN MENTIONED AND THAT WAS APPROVED ACTUALLY IN LATE DECEMBER. AB PROVIDES. A NATIONWIDE THREE NINE TEN BILL DOLLARS FOR THE PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM. FIFTEEN MILLION FOR THE LIVE VENUES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO. OPEN AT ALL. AND I'M FIFTEEN BILLION FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES OF THIS IS JUST- OUR ATTEMPT TO. TRY TO BRIDGE GAP A LITTLE BIT BETWEEN THE NEED AND WHAT WE CAN ACTUALLY. PROVIDE AND NOW THAT I HAVE. ON THE AS WELL IT TO JUST. THAT THE FEDERAL. WILL CAN. TO PROVIDE- FEDERAL RESERVE. IN AREA AND ARE. CAN COME UP ALONGSIDE IN MAY FELT IN THE NEED. THAT ARE NOT MET THROUGH THE FEDERAL PROGRAM IS THAT IT LEAST IT. CONTEMPLATED IN THIS. YES THAT'S PART OF IT YES WE ARE HOPING TO- WORK M. ALONGSIDE THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. I'M TO PROVIDE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THE PEOPLE AND EFFECTIVE BUSINESS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M ALSO- IT IN IN YOUR STATEMENT- MISCUES MON YOU INDICATED THAT- THAT THE FIRST GRANTS THAT ARE BEING ROLLED OUT. SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE PROPOSAL FOR GEOGRAPHIC INDUSTRY AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES CAN YOU GIVE US. YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE DATA ON THAT OR IS THAT SOMETHING YOU CAN PROVIDE AYE AYE. AM I AM- VERY SENSITIVE TO THE G. A. DISTRIBUTE- THIS WASN'T YOUR PROGRAM BUT QUITE FRANKLY THE MONEY THAT WENT OUT TO COUNTIES- TONY SINCE. INDICATE THAT THE WE DO AS PART OF THAT- CARE ACT DISTRIBUTION INDICATED THAT MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT WE'RE SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANTLY SHORT CHANGED IN TERMS OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS AND SINCE I AT MY DISTRICT IS MOSTLY RURAL- IT DID THAT THERE IS A SENSE AND A FEELING THAT- RURAL COMMUNITIES ALWAYS END UP. GETTING THE SHORT END OF THE STICK WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCES AND THAT FLOWS THROUGH THE STATE AND SO- CAN YOU GIVE US SOME INFORMATION ON THE GEOGRAPHIC- DISTRIBUTION AS WELL AS THE INDUSTRY'S- THAT HAVE BEEN I. AND IN TERMS OF THAT BUT UNDERSERVED I WAS THE IMPRESSED BY THE NUMBERS THAT YOU CITED- AND I LOOKING AT MY NOTES THAT IT THREE QUARTERS OF THE- OF THE GRANTS WENT TO DISADVANTAGED- SMALL BUSINESSES AND TWO THIRDS TO THE HIGHLY IMPACTED INDUSTRIES AND IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THOSE. THOSE TWO ISSUES THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT ACTUALLY A THREE ISSUES. YES OF COURSE SENATOR AND WE ARE PRIORITIZE THOSE IMPACTED AREAS- AND L'INDUSTRIE OUR INTERMEDIARY HAS HAD STRONG PERFORMANCE AND IN THOSE AREAS IN THE PAST AND SO- YOU KNOW THOSE THOSE CALCULATIONS WERE MADE AS THEY ASSESS THE FULL GRANT- POOL OF APPLICANTS AT ONCE THE APPLICATION CLOSE- FOR THE UNDERSERVED SMALL BUSINESSES YOU KNOW WE DEFINE THAT. ALIGNS WITH OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHICH IS- PEOPLE OF COLOR WOMEN RURAL AS WELL AS- AS WELL AS VETERAN OF BUSINESSES AS WELL AND THEN IN ADDITION TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LMI TRACKS THAT EXIST AROUND THE STATE SO. THE ALL OF THOSE ARE INCLUDED. IN THE TOTAL PERCENT OF COURSE THERE'S CROSSOVER AND THEY'RE DEFINITELY YOU KNOW VETERANS WERE ALSO PEOPLE OF COLOR EXCEPT TRAP BUT THAT THAT THREE QUARTERS IS- INDIVIDUALLY TOTAL- THE AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE IMPACTED INDUSTRIES WE PRIORITIZED IT PRIORITIZED INDUSTRIES IMPACTED BY CORPORATE NINETEEN OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE DEFINED IS HIGHLY IMPACTED. THOSE ARE THE ONES I WAS REFERENCING IN TERMS OF TWO THIRDS WENT TO HIGHLY IMPACTED INDUSTRIES THAT SAID. A FEDERAL DEFINITION BUT IT INCLUDES- YOU KNOW CERTAIN INDUSTRY CODES LIKE PERSONAL CARE AND EVERYTHING WITHIN THAT RESTAURANTS AND OTHER EATING PLACES A CHILD CARE SERVICES A RETAIL CLOTHING STORES SPECIALTY FOOD- AND THEN THE REMAINDER OF THE GRANTS WENT TO OTHER IMPACTED INDUSTRIES- BUT WE WERE. GLAD TO SEE THAT HIGHLY IMPACTED INDUSTRIES ALSO- YOU ROSE TO THE TOP IN TERMS OF THEM IN TERMS OF DOLLARS RECEIVED. THE- AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION GEOGRAPHY AND ESPECIALLY IMPACT BY COPA NINETY. WERE FOUND. I WITH THE STATE COMPLETELY. AT A STATE HOME OR I'VE ALL. AT ALL ALL CAO WERE IN. AND SO- YOU SEE AND IT JUST. OF THIS- WHICH ALSO TO THE ABILITY THESE PAR ON THE TO SEE- INTO- INTO COME. AKAU. ACROSS THE STATE FOR BUSINESS OUTREACH ON OUTRAGE. SO WE DID A- ACROSS THREE WE DO FOR SOME FURTHER DE- THAT WOULD AND TO. DO THE LEGISLATIVE. LAST FROM FINANCE ARE HOPEFUL YOU ENOUGH TO REVIEW THAT IS ENJOY. WHAT WERE TRYING TO IT SHE AND WHAT WE WERE ABLE. AND THEN- WAS THERE SOME. IT WAS PART OF THE- ALSO WERE THOSE PER IN SAID RECEIVED FEDERAL ASSISTANCE AND PAST. THE BUSINESS'S OUR OUR ARE WHAT OTHER GRAN OR PER THEY RECEIVE AS WELL WHAT THEY'RE- DROPS WERE- AND SO THAT THOSE- IMPACT COULD BE- PROCESS YEAH. CHANNEL WITH THE HIM FOR AS WELL FROM THE IN. I OKAY VERY GOOD. SENATOR NAY. YOUR RECORD IS MINE ARE THESE DISTRIBUTION- MOAMMAR. IN A CON. OR MEMORANDUM OF UNDER WHAT IS THE FOR MAY OF- AFFECTING THEN TRAIN OF MY AND WHAT KINDS OF REQUIRE ARE IMPOSED. ON THE END OF WHO GETS THE GIRL- WHAT ARE THE LEVEL WHAT MUCH THEY DO. TWO COULD TO GET THE BEST. I SEE YOUR YOU ARE THE END OF SMALL ALREADY CRIME YES WE DON'T WANT TO GET ON A BIG FOR THING THAT SO RAMP AND GOV TODAY. HOWEVER WE GO TO AND THE AND THEY'VE IS VAL AND THAT THEY ARE IN FACT DISTRICT THE MONEY AND THE WITH THEY'RE REPRESENT WAS. CRACKS THAT WE DO SOME. THIS IS AS I MENTIONED- AT BEN OF WORK WITH THAT A FINANCIAL TO. IN THIS CASE A WE NEED TO BE FUND INSTITUTIONS THAT THERE ACCUSTOMED THE LONG. TO CHECK ABOUT SO THERE ARE NONE THERE ARE BACKGROUND CHECK IN PLACE TO CLEAR- THAT ARE DONE CREDIT CHECK. AS WELL AS- AS CHECK ON SEX OF STATE OR OTHER YOU KNOW LOCAL. CHANGE SO THAT WE CAN ABOUT. THIS IS NICK BUSINESS AB BENEFIT OF THIS FOR. I BY STRUCTURE IS THE BUSINESS HAD BE OPERATE IN THOUSAND NINETEEN WHICH WE CANNOT SEE. TAX WHICH AND SO THOSE ARE. IN ADDITION SO THERE ARE STEM- YEAH. CHECKS TO MAKE SURE THIS IS AN- INVALID. I IN TO PREVENT FROM WASTE AND ABUSE I. ADDITIONALLY OF COURSE THERE IS A LOT OF THAT. FROM THE BEST IN TERMS OF USE OF FUNDS WE ASKED THEM TO OUR YOU KNOW CONFIRM THE THEY WOULD BE. THIS ARE L. FOR. ADDITION OF THIS PROGRAM AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING ON THE GROUNDS- IF THROUGH OUR PARTNERS AS WELL WHO HAPPENED A XIN SHIPS ARE IN MANY CASES WITH THESE. WITH THESE ENTITIES. ARE THESE FORMALIZED IN SOME MANNER THEN YOU HAVE INDIVIDUALS ASSIGNED TO OVERSEE THIS AND THEN REPORT. DO YOU TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND TO THE LEGISLATURE AS TO OUR PROGRESS. WITH OUR ELECTED LEADER INDIVIDUALLY THANK YOU SENATOR YES OUR OUR INTERMEDIARY AND USUALLY UP FRONT AND TRACKS ALL THOSE CHECKS THAT I WAS MENTIONING TO YOU INVALIDATES THOSE I'M ON AN INDIVIDUAL APPLICANT BASIS- A AND DAY AND VERIFIES THAT THE APPLICANT HAS TO WHEN APPLYING- VALIDATE AND CERTIFY THOSE VIA THE USE OF FUNDS EXCEPT TRACK AND THEN WHEN THEY SIGNED THEIR CONTRACT RECEIVED- FUNDS IS STILL ACTED THEY ALSO HAVE TO VALIDATE. ALL THAT INFORMATION AND CERTIFY THEIR USE EXCEPT. I ALL THAT IS WHAT I MIGHT HAVE MISSED THIS BUT WHO THE INTERVIEW OR THAT THROUGH THE HOME THIS IS REPORTED ARE THEY WITHIN YOUR AGENCY OR ANOTHER INDEPENDENT pOUTSIDE- INTO T. A COMMUNITY BUILDING FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CALLED THE REGISTRY AND SO IT IT IS- EXTERNAL CONTRACT THAT WE HAVE. AND COMPETITIVELY BID TO SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION OF THIS PROGRAM AND DESERVE CONTRACT HAVE DELIVERABLES- IN IT AND TIME LINES. CORRECT CORRECT WE HAVE DELIVERABLES SCHEDULES AND WELL AS YOU KNOW A COMMITMENT TO DELIVER I PRIORITIES ON IT WITHIN THAT CONTRACT FACT. AND WHAT IS YOUR MEANS OF- TRANSMITTING SUCH INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. AT THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'VE THAT SUBMITTED SOME INFORMATION TO THE BUDGET. COMMITTEE AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AS WE GET THROUGH ADDITIONAL ROUNDS OF THIS PROGRAM. OKAY BUT THE ONE THANK YOU I'M I'M DRAWING ON THAT BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING AND I'M GOING TO KEEP A VERY CLOSE EYE ON. AND THEN IT'S OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY AND IN THE TERMS OF ITS BUDGET AUTHORITY- THIS COMMITTEE WILL HAVE TO BE VERY FASTIDIOUS ABOUT THAT AND AS YOU KNOW OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE BUDGET COMMITTEES OF THE SENATE HAVE BEEN VERY VERY. ON THE TO OVERSIGHT- NOT JUST TO GIVE US A REPORT AND WE'LL FILE IT AWAY BUT WE WE'VE HAD OVERSIGHT HEARINGS AND WE'RE GETTING INTO THE- OF MINUTE AND THE MYTH MINUSCULE. AND WE'RE REALLY LOOKING OVER THE. TO KEEP TRACK OF THIS THIS IS A LOT OF MONEY. GOING OUT. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IT IS GOING OUT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROMISE. AND THE FILL UP LET ME IF I MAY MISTER WHETHER FOR COULD YOU- PIPE IN HERE TOO AS TO. YOU OUTLINED A NUMBER OF VERY VALID AREAS OF CONCERN. ARE YOU SATISFIED AT THIS POINT. THAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE IN THE FORMATION AND THE ORGANIZATION AS DESCRIBED BY THE DIRECTOR. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU POINTED OUT SOME DEFICIENCIES AND WE NEED TO BE ON TOP OF THOSE I THINK THAT'S MY POINT I'M NOT BEING ACCUSATORY BUT THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ASSURE YOU. WE'VE RAISED OUR CONCERNS THAT WERE. WERE RAISED TO US- AND THEY- THEY IT SOUNDS LIKE THE ADMINISTRATION IS BEGINNING TO ADDRESS THOSE AND WE'VE ALSO RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT- TRANSPARENCY AND- ADMINISTRATION HAS BEGUN TO FLOW DOCUMENTS TO US- SO FOR EXAMPLE OUR OFFICE RECEIVED. THE CONTRACT. A COPY OF THE CONTRACT. A YES AFTERNOON BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE FOR EXAMPLE TO REVIEW IT SO YOU HAVE- HOPEFULLY OVER THE COMING. DAYS YOU HAVE A CONTENT. WE DID RECEIVE A COPY OF THE CONTRACT COULD YOU TO TRANSMIT THAT OR- IF I MAY ASK FINANCED TO TRANSMIT THAT. TO THE CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. SO WE GET THE KIND OF REVIEW THE CONTRACT OURSELVES. YES I'D BE HAPPY TO DO THAT IF. I WANT TO VERIFY THAT THE THAT I DID I. IF I DO APOLOGIZE MY INTERNET WAS I WAS OUT YESTERDAY SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT HECTIC IN HE AFTERNOON- UNDERSTOOD BUT ON. WELL I'M SORRY TO HAVE TO MAKE THIS OBSERVATION BUT I HAVE LITTLE TRUST. AND SO I NEED MORE VERIFICATION AND THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING TO IN YOUR CONTRACTS WITH YOUR PROVIDERS. AND TRACKING THE SUCCESS OR THE LACK OF SUCCESS. OF WERE OF THAT MONEY IS DIRECTED. AND MOST ASSUREDLY I'M AS CONCERNED AS OUR CHAIR IS ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION FAIRLY ACROSS THE STATE. IT IS THE NORM NOT THE EXCEPTION THAT THE RURAL AREAS ARE NEGLECTED. WE'VE SEEN THAT MOST RECENTLY IN A SO CALLED WEBSITE SINCE THEN PUT UP FOR. THE TO ASSIST OUR OUR CITIZENS SO THAT WEBSITES ONLY AVAILABLE TO ONE COUNTY ENOUGH TAKE UP TO SIX MONTHS FOR THE OTHER. FIFTY SEVEN COUNTIES THE TO ACCESS THAT. THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME SO WE'RE GONNA NEED A LOT OF THAT OVERSIGHT WE THANK YOU FOR BEING FOR SERIOUS ABOUT THAT AND RAISING THESE CONCERNS. AND THEN BE ADVISED I'M GOING TO CERTAINLY BE WATCHING IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER NELSON. SENATOR NIELSEN- ON ON NOT ON THAT ISSUE- I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ON. THE PHONE CALL WHERE L'INDUSTRIE WAS INTRODUCED AND WROTE THE PROGRAM WAS ROLLED OUT AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT TIME. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH LINDA STREETS- QUALIFICATIONS WITH THEIR THEIR MISSION AND- THE FACT THAT THEIR TO THEIR- LICENSE AS A CDFI. SAYS A LOT ABOUT WHAT THEIR MISSION AND THEIR GOAL IS AND SO I'VE BEEN- I I'M I'M VERY HOPEFUL THAT THIS PROGRAM RUN SMOOTHLY AND THAT THEY'VE GOT THAT. THE EXPERTISE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY MEET THE- THE STATED PURPOSE FOR WHICH THIS GRANT PROGRAM WAS SET UP. BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE TRANSPARENCY SOME REALLY GLAD TO HEAR THAT THE CONTRACT- YOU HAVE A COPY OF THE CONTRACT AND- WILL GET A CHANCE TO REVIEW THAT TO MAKE. SURE THAT THERE ARE DELIVERABLES- THAT WE CAN. VERIFY A THE KIND OF ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY SENATOR NIELSEN- AND- AND I AND I THINK THAT- AS THIS PROGRAM ROLLS OUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME ISSUES RAISED BY SOME OF THE- SOME OF THE- PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS ABOUT THE FIRST ROUND OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS. AND I'M I'M VERY INTERESTED IN. IN HEARING WHAT KIND OF IMPROVEMENTS YOU CAN SEE TO THE PROGRAM THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE IT EITHER MORE ACCESSIBLE OR- OR YEP MORE ACCESSIBLE ACTUALLY IS REALLY WHAT IT WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT I THINK THAT. THAT THE- I'VE BEEN IMPRESSED WITH THE SPEED AT WHICH- THIS PROGRAM IS ROLLED OUT AND THAT THE- PROFESSIONALISM OF L'INDUSTRIE BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE OUT- A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT ACCESS THAT- THAT NEED TO BE DEALT WITH SO IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT THEN WILL MOVE ON TO- SENATOR SKINNER'S QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR YES AND- YOU KNOW THE IT WAS A COMPETITIVE BID PROCESS THAT SELECTED L'INDUSTRIE OUR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS WAS PUT OUT ON CAL THE PROCURE. I WITH THE STATEMENT OF WORK TO FIND- WHICH YOU WILL FIND MIMICKED IN THE CONTRACTS SO IT WAS IS. A PUBLIC PROCESS FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE- V. THE- THE ADDITIONAL- THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE WHAT WE FOUND TO BE REALLY EFFECTIVE AS IS THE CDFI NETWORKS THAT ARE COLLABORATING TOGETHER- ARE YOU. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NETWORKS THAT ARE COLLABORATING TOGETHER- THEY'VE HAD TIME TO RAMP UP STAFF IN MANY CASES THEY'VE DONE MULTIPLE WEBINARS THAT ARE AVAILABLE NOW FOR CONTENT- WE'VE BEEN THAT EFFECTIVE IN GETTING. THE MESSAGE OUT VIA EARNED MEDIA AND SOCIAL MEDIA- TOO MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AND SO- YOU KNOW WE FEEL THAT THAT THAT IS GOING TO GIVE US ADDITIONAL CHARGES WE ENTER ROUND TWO- YEAH WE'RE PLEASED THAT WE WERE ABLE TO WRAP UP ROUND ONE QUICKLY AND GIVE YOU THE DATA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE OF COURSE. AS WE WERE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS AND DATA WAS NOT AVAILABLE. IN A TO SHARE AS WE WENT THROUGH BUT NOW THAT THE ROUND ONE IS CLOSED WE'RE PLEASED THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT DATED TO YOU AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- SO WHAT WE HOPE TO DO IN IN ROUND TWO FOR IMPROVEMENTS- WE- ARE OUR PARTNERS ON THE GROUND CONTINUALLY NEED THAT SUPPORT WE EVEN HAD ONE PARTNER- IN THE- IN. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- DOING DRIVE THROUGH DOCUMENT UPLOAD AND ASSISTANCE AND SO OUR PARTNERS ARE GETTING CREATIVE IN TERMS OF THAT THE RESOURCES THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE ON THE GROUND WE'RE HAVING SOME. TARGETED LANGUAGE- WORKING GROUP'S WITH OUR PARTNERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO- AND CONTINUALLY MEETS THE NEEDS OF THOSE WHO REQUIRE SERVICES IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES- AND WHERE YOU'RE TRANSLATING THE APPLICATIONS- IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES SO THAT. INDIVIDUALS CAN CAN FOLLOW ALONG IN ADDITION TO THE VIDEOS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED TO THEM FOR APPLICANTS- APPLICATION PROCESS. AND SO- YOU KNOW THAT THOSE TYPES. OF THE CONTINUOUS CREATIVE OUT WE THE- THE- AND- ASSISTANCE WILL WILL BE. AT ABOUT AS WE THROUGH. THE PROCESS- IN TERMS OF- IN TERMS OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND THAT THE CALL CENTER SUPPORT THAT L'INDUSTRIE HAS. HAS DELIVERED THE INCREASE THEIR CAPACITY- THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS AS WELL AS EXPANDED THE CALL CENTER SUPPORT TOWARDS THE END OF THE PROGRAM THEY EXPANDED HOURS YOU KNOW BASICALLY UP UNTIL ELEVEN PM AT NIGHT. A SIX AM TO ELEVEN PM AND THEY WELL IN ROUND TWO- EXPAND THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE CALL CENTER. AVAILABILITY IS AGAIN AGAIN WHAT WE FOUND- THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE WAS THAT- ONE AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE WERE VERY FRANTIC AND APPLYING MORE THAN ONCE IN JAMMING THE SYSTEM 25% OF- OF ALL. APPLICATIONS ABOUT THE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND WERE DUPLICATES AND THAT WE HAVE TO CLEAR OUT THE SYSTEM WITH AND SO. I THINK THAT YOU KNOW YOU'LL YOU'LL SEE THAT THEN. HOPEFULLY THAT- THAT FRANTIC THIS HAS HAS RESIGNED A LITTLE BIT SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE CUSTOM SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHO WHO NEED IT- TO GET THROUGH THE SYSTEM- IN IN ADDITION- YOU KNOW WE HOPE TO. CONTINUE TO TRY. WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT NEED FURTHER CLARIFICATION WE WANT TO INCREASE OUR COMMUNICATION ACROSS THE APPLICATION FEATURES AS WELL AS- THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT. EVERYBODY HAS THE INFORMATION THEY NEED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND SO INCREASED- COMMUNICATION WITH OUR PARTNERS AND WITH THE APPLICANTS WILL WILL BE A NEW FEATURE AS WE MOVE INTO THIS NEXT ROUND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT- CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU CHAIR CABALLERO- I WANTED TO MY EYES GOING TO DIRECT MY FIRST QUESTION TO- ADMINISTRATION REP WHO IS MOST APPROPRIATE TO ANSWER THIS. IN LOOKING AT THE LETTER THAT THE LEGISLATURE RECEIVED REGARDING THE GRANTS THAT WERE DISTRIBUTED SO FAR. I'M LOOKING AT THE TABLE WHERE IT INDICATES THAT WHICH- D. IMPACTED INDUSTRIES WORDED AND IT SHOWS A GOOD PERCENT FOR PERSONAL CARE WHICH I THINK WOULD MAKE SENSE TO MOST EVERYONE GIVEN THAT ALMOST ALL PERSONAL CARE. I FACILITIES HAD TO BE CLOSED IN REALLY SOME NOT OPENED AT ALL- IN VARIOUS OTHER THINGS NOW WHAT'S NOT CLEAR FROM HERE. IS THE- PERFORMANCE WILL RECORD CULTURAL BUT PERFORMANCE MUSEUM THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH WE KNOW. IF WE TAKE IF WE COMPARE TO RESTAURANTS WHILE RESTAURANTS AND BARS WERE SERIOUSLY IMPACTED. MANY COULD STILL OPERATE TO A DEGREE WITH TO GO FOR EXAMPLE WHERE S. PERFORMANCE VENUES MUSEUMS AND ALL THAT HAD TO CLOSE COMPLETELY AND MOST OF NOT OPERATED AT ALL SINCE MARCH. SO IT I WANTED. TO- WE'RE NO GRANTS PROVIDED TO THAT CATEGORY IN THIS LAST ROUND AND IS IT ONLY ARE WE ONLY LOOKING FORWARD FOR THAT IN THIS NEXT- IN THE PROPOSAL YOU HAVE BEFORE US OR WERE THERE SOME INCLUDED IN THIS LAST ROUND. BUT WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH SPECIFIC DATA ON THAT- I KNOW THAT THAT YES THERE WERE MULTIPLE INDUSTRIES IN INCLUDING- YOU KNOW MANY NONPROFITS SERVED- WITHIN THAT CATEGORY BUT I HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU FOR SPECIFIC AND KIND OF COURSES YOU KNOW JUST LIKE REGULAR BUSINESS NONPROFIT IS A HUGE CATEGORY NONPROFIT COULD MEAN. ANY ANY NUMBER OF IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY PERFORMANCE OR CULTURAL. OPERATIONS SO I GUESS WHAT I'M REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TARGETING IMPACTED INDUSTRIES THIS IS WHEN I'M TRYING TO GET A HANDLE AT- ARE WE DO WE HAVE CRITERIA. THAT TARGETS THOSE THAT HAVE HAD. TO EXPERIENCE FAR MORE SUBSTANTIAL OR SIGNIFICANT AND OFTEN USING DIFFERENT WORDS THAT CLOSURES OR DROP IN OPERATIONS THAN OTHERS. WE WERE TKING INTO ACCOUNT THE BLUEPRINTS- YOUR FIRST SAFELY REOPENING AS WELL AS SARAH IT IS WELL IT'S JUST YOUR GRAPHIC INDUSTRY IMPACT WHEN WE WHEN WE PRIORITIZE BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS TO BE SERVED. OKAY WELL LOOKING AT THE RESPONSE TO THE FIRST ROUND IN OBVIOUSLY SO MUCH LARGER THAN WHAT WE HAD AVAILABLE AND EVEN IF WE ACT AND- ME EVEN. THE REQUESTED NOW IS ALREADY LOWER THAN WHAT WE KNOW THE DEMAND WHETHER THAT WHETHER DEMAND THE NEED- EXACTLY THE SAME I'M NOT GONNA QUITE YET BUT- IF I JUST TAKE DEMAND. SO ASSUMING THAT THERE IS GREATER NEED. THAN THE FUNDS THAT WERE NOW TALKING ABOUT BEING MADE AVAILABLE. HOW IS IT THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT THOSE MOST IMPACTED FINANCIALLY ARE BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THESE GRANTS. YEAH A LOT OF IT THAT I THINK IS DRIVEN BY THE OUTRAGE AND THE ENGAGEMENT THAT WE THAT WE CONDUCT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS THE SECOND ROUND DISCOVERY SECOND THROUGH A IN ADDITIONAL FUNDS ARE AWARDED- CONTINUING TO ADD ON INTO FUTURE ROUNDS- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S ALONE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY OUR REACH IS IMPORTANT BUT IT'S THE CRITERIA ADDITION RIGHT I THINK THAT'S HE QUESTION WHEN WE USE THE WORDS LIKE TRANSPARENCY WHAT WE'RE REALLY MEANING IT I THINK MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE MEANS SOMETHING ELSE BUT- IS WHAT. ARE THE CRITERIA. YES SENATOR I AGREE AND DOES NOT WAS GOING TO BE THE SECOND POINT WAS IN ADDITION- THE WAY THAT WE'VE PRIORITIZED- IMPACTED INDUSTRIES AS WELL AS IMPACTED- COMMUNITIES GEOGRAPHIES AND UNDERSERVED BUSINESS GROUPS AND SO- YOU KNOW IF. IF MORE SPECIFIC TARGETING TOWARDS SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES IS OF INTEREST I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A REQUEST FOR TWENTY FIVE MILLION SPECIFICALLY FOR CULTURE INSTITUTION AS AN EXAMPLE. OF ME THAT CAN BE EMBEDDED IN IN THE PROGRAM IN THE ANALYSIS IN FUTURE IN FUTURE ROUNDS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING. OKAY SO NOW- I WANT SOME QUESTIONS THE ELADIO- SO YOU LAID OUT YOUR REPORT IN THESE VARIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS- AND I NOTICED IN THE FINAL PAGES YOU DO MAKE SOME SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FOR HOW TO TARGET- BUT THE MAIN SPECIFIC ONE IS TARGET ENTITIES THAT WERE NOT ABLE TO GET THE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. ON AND WE MAY WANT TO REVISIT WHETHER OUR CRITERIA IN FACT DOES THAT OR NOT BUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM LA- IS WHAT I ALWAYS APPRECIATE- L. A. O. OFTEN RAISES SOME VERY LEGITIMATE POINTS BUT DOES NOT NECESSARILY GIVE US. SPECIFIC CONCRETE SUGGESTIONS FOR WHAT WE MIGHT CONSIDER IN TERMS OF IMPROVING. EITHER THAT OF IMPROVING OUR ABILITY TO REACH THE MOST IMPACTED ENTITY OR IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY SO WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR FROM LA- IS IF. THEY HAD ANY SPECIFIC. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OUR CONSIDERATION BEYOND FOR EXAMPLE THE TARGETING OF ENTITIES THAT COULDN'T GET FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. HELLO YES SO- ONE ONE THING THAT WAS BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION WAS THE IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDED ON GRANTS OR A NEW A NEW PROGRAM TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PERFORMING INSTITUTIONS AND MANY OF THE STATE'S MUSEUMS AND CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS WITH PERFORMANCE SPACES WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT FEDERAL PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE BUT- BUT SOME OF THAT DON'T HAVE DEDICATED PERFORMANCE SPACES MAY NOT BE AND SO THAT MIGHT BE ONE AREA IN PARTICULAR WHERE WE MIGHT LOOK AT TARGETING THIS PROGRAM BETTER SO IT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DO HAVE A SET ASIDE FOR CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS. YOU MIGHT LOOK AT WHERE. WHERE THERE'S A GAP IN THAT IN THAT PARTICULAR WAY. ON THAT THAT'S ONE CONCRETE- SUGGESTION WE HAVE. ANOTHER IS ACTUALLY ASKING- YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE INDUSTRY'S- THAT THAT WERE MOST TARGETED AND LOOKING AT. THE ON THE REVENUE DECLINES- DID THEY- DID THEY RECEIVE- A P. P. P. THAT WAS PROPORTIONAL WITH THE AMOUNT OF THE REVENUE DECLINE AND- IN MAY BE PRIORITIZING IT TOWARDS THOSE THAT HAVE THE LARGEST GAP BETWEEN. THEIR ON THEIR DECLINE IN IN REVENUE AND PERHAPS ALSO LOOKING AT. THREE ANY INCREASE IN THEIR OPERATING EXPENSES IN RESPONDING TO COPE IT. SO THERE'S WAYS TO- FURTHER FURTHER NARROW- WITHIN THIS GROUP THAT'S ORIGINALLY TARGETED SO- YOU KNOW IN ANOTHER- ANOTHER OBSERVATION WE HAD IS THAT- IN THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION. ALL COUNTIES IN THE STATE HAVE BEEN- UNDER- STATE HOMEOWNERS AT SOME POINT SO- WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE WE'RE KIND OF- GEOGRAPHICALLY BEING EVENLY WEIGHTED AND HOW WE'RE LOOK FOR LOOKING AT OTHERS. AND STILL STILL NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ON THAT BUT- BUT PERHAPS IT SHOULD BE TARGETED TOWARDS- THE COUNTIES WHERE THEY WERE UNDER- MUCH LONGER- IN THE PURPLE CHAIR FOR EXAMPLE. THANKS I APPRECIATE THAT AND I RAISE THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE IN OVERSIGHT HEARING NOW WE'RE NOT VOTING AND- WE'RE OBVIOUSLY. THE GOVERNOR'S INTENT WHICH I SUPPORT AND I THINK I THINK. NOT TO BE TOO BOLD FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT ALSO WOULD BE TO WE KNOW. THAT OUR SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS HURTING WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE IN TERMS OF GETTING US BACK ON TRACK ECONOMICALLY THEY ARE THE PRIMARY PROVIDER OF JOBS IN THE STATE AND WE KNOW THAT. VAST MAJORITY OF JOBS LOST OF PEOPLE ARE STILL UNEMPLOYED WERE PEOPLE THAT WERE HAD BEEN EMPLOYED BY SMALL BUSINESS. THIS IS CLEARLY A VERY IMPORTANT AREA. AND WHAT THE L. A. O.'S AND IT'S AND IT'S NOT ONLY A. VERY IMPORTANT AREA IT'S ONE OF THOSE WHERE. URGENCY AND IMMEDIACY ACTION IS BENEFICIAL. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO DO IT RIGHT SO THE L. A. O.'S DOCUMENT WAS A LITTLE- OKAY LESS HELPFUL FOR ME ONLY BECAUSE IN SAYING THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO COLLECT DATA OR REVIEW THESE THINGS BEFORE. AND THAT IS OPTIMAL AT TIMES BUT WE ARE IN A WE ARE WE ARE IN NEED OF IMMEDIATE ACTION NOW SO GIVEN OUR PAST EXPERIENCE. AND A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE TO LA ONE OTHERS HAVE. SOME CONCRETE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE FOURTH WASTE EITHER TARGET OR- ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT ELIO RAISED WOULD BE I. THINK HELPFUL FOR US- THE OTHER SENATOR SKINNER YOU MIGHT WANT EXCUSE ME YOU MIGHT WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE RANKING- IS- OF MISCUES MON- SINCE THEY SET UP THE THIS PROGRAM AND- ANYWAY THAT MAY BE THAT THE APPROPRIATE THE WAY TOO YEAH TO GET. A LITTLE BIT MORE AND WILL BECAUSE THAT IF I UNDERSTAND IT RIGHT AND I DID MISS THE VERY OPENING IS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO HOW THE RANKING WOULD OCCUR PRIOR TO THE ISSUING OF THE GRANTS CORRECT SO. IT I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT TO SEE THE EXACT. THE PROPOSAL FOR HOW TO RANK AND MAYBE IT HOW IT WAS RANKED SO FAR AND THEN HOW. THE ADMINISTRATION IS. PROPOSING TO RANK FOR THE NEXT ROUND SO THAT WE CAN IF WE FEEL APPROPRIATE MODIFY THAT GOING FORWARD. SO IF I IF FROM THE ADMINISTRATION COULD RESPOND TO THAT I'M NOT SURE WHICH PERSON IS THE PROPER ONE. THIS IS A DIRECTOR THIS MONTH SO WE- WE DID NOT HAVE SPECIFIC TARGET NUMBERS FOR SET ASIDES BY INDUSTRY OR BY GEOGRAPHY OR BY UNDERSERVED CATEGORY SO THERE WERE NOT A PERCENTAGE- GOALS OR OR OR STATUS SIDES IDENTIFIED- IT WAS. MORE OF AN ANALYSIS AND ALGORITHM THAT L'INDUSTRIE CREATED TO- TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE HITTING THOSE PRIORITY CATEGORIES GEOGRAPHIC- IMPACT OF COOLEY NINETEEN. BASED ON YOUR BLUEPRINTS IN ENCLOSURES EXCEPT TRACK AS WELL AS INDUSTRY IMPACTED BY YOU KNOW IMPACTED INDUSTRIES YOUR FALL OFF IN TERMS OF THEIR CLOSURES OR REVENUE DROPS SUBJECT- AND THEN THE. UNDERSERVED AND DISADVANTAGED. SO I APPRECIATE AND I COMPRISED FINE WITH THAT THEIR WORK PER SE SET ASIDES. BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US IF L'INDUSTRIE COULD PROVIDE US SOMETHING MORE CONCRETE THAT SHOWS WHAT THE CRITERIA WORK. BECAUSE IT IN OTHER WORDS IT IS IT THAT'S WHERE IT BECOMES THIS ISSUE OF TRANSPARENCY SO IS THERE SOMETHING MORE. A LITTLE MORE CLARITY ON. THE EITHER HOW THE ALGORITHM DETERMINED PRIORITY OR CRITERIA FOR PRIORITY WE CAN WE CAN THE SENATOR WE CAN DEFINITELY FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AND SEE WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE- I KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW L'INDUSTRIE AS IN ALL THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY- SO WE CANNOT AND WE ARE WORKING WE CAN SEE WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SPECIFIC ENOUGH TO SHARE FURTHER INSIGHTS WELL. I APPRECIATE THAT SO MAYBE IT'S INSTEAD WHAT DIRECTION WE GAVE THAT BECAUSE IT IS STATE MONEY IS GOING TO LEAD TO SPREE SO CERTAINLY I DON'T WANT TO. INTERFERE WITH LINDA STREETS PRIORITY BUT- WE WERE THAT YOU KNOW. IT IS STATE MONEY AND WE ARE. TRYING TO PROVIDE MORE OF MORE THAN JUST HIGH HIGH LEVEL GUIDANCE ON HOW IT GOES OUT. SENATOR IF I MAY AND WILL WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU AND ALL THE INDUSTRIES THAT WERE COVERED AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN. AND ALL THE OTHER INFORMATION- OKAY SO THAT WOULD BE WHAT WAS COVERED BUT ALSO GOING FORWARD WHAT YES. OKAY NOW. SOMEONE MAY HAVE ALREADY ASKED THIS. BUT GIVEN THAT WE ARE HOPING NOT HOPING WE INTEND TO EXPAND THAT YOUR PROPOSAL AND WHILE IT'S NOT BEEN ADOPTED YET I AM GOING TO ASSUME THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS IN AGREEMENT THAT WE DO WANT TO EXPAND- THIS LED TO STREET IS THAT YOUR ASSESSMENT THAT L'INDUSTRIE YES THE CAPACITY TO DO SO. OR ARE YOU ALSO TALKING OTHER VENDORS. IT WOULD BE OUR INTEREST TO CONTINUE WITH THAT THE SAME. VENDOR I MEAN ONE THE SYSTEM IS SET UP- SO IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY AND SCALE AND DOING THIS QUICKLY- L'INDUSTRIE IS EQUIPPED TO DO THAT- YEAH THEY DID OPERATE THE LARGEST A GRANT PROGRAM IN THE STATE BEFORE THEY DID PENNSYLVANIA'S AS AN EXAMPLE- AMONG. NINE OTHER PROGRAMS. SO WE DO TRUST AND HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS TO DELIVER THE RESULTS THAT WE WANT- YEAH ADDITIONALLY. WE HAVE THOSE APPLICANTS IN THE SYSTEM IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO HAVE THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE TO REAPPLY WITH ANY OTHER VENDOR- I THINK THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN EXTREME CRIMES OCCUR OKAY. NOW AND MAYBE ON I MAY HAVE MISSED THIS BUT IS OUR ANTICIPATION THAT IF THE IF THE BUDGET MAN ON THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO APPROVE THE FUNDING THAT'S BEEN REQUESTED THAT WE WOULD ONLY BE CONSIDERING THOSE THAT HAVE ALREADY APPLIED OR WOULD WE BE. ON OPENING. AGAIN AND CONSIDERING NEW APPLICANTS. YES WE WOULD BE OPENING AGAIN EVEN IN OUR ROUND TWO WITH THIS HALF SECOND HALF OF THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM WE ARE RE OPENING AT TWO NEW APPLICANTS SO ALL THE- ALL THOSE WHO WERE NOT SELECTED ONE ONE D. ROUND ONE TO MOVE FORWARD. AND OTHERS ARE ABLE TO APPLY. OKAY SO AT THAT POINT WE WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE WAS. IF IN THE FIRST ROUND WE HAD- LIMITATION LIMITED MATERIAL SAY IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE OR- WHATEVER LIMITED TYPE OF OUTREACH WE COULD WE COULD ADDRESS THOSE. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY- I THINK THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS I HAVE I WANTED TO ANNEX IN ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS I WANT TO BE CLEAR I AM NOT RAISING THEM TO CAUSE US TO NOT MOVE FORWARD I'M RAISING THEM TO GIVE US THE ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE BEST EFFICIENCY SIMPLICITY BUT ALSO MEETING THE NEEDS OF THOSE WHO WHO NEED IT MOST THEY CAN GIVE US THE BEST RETURN IN TERMS OF- MAINTAINING THOSE BUSINESSES AND ULTIMATELY WHEN ART WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO CIRCULATE BETTER. THAT THOSE BUSINESSES WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO RE EMPLOY PEOPLE. YES SENATOR IF I MAY JUST ADD TO THAT BRIEFLY THAT- WE DO WE CAN PROVIDE TO YOU THAT THE CRITERIA IT WAS OUTLINED IN OUR OURS P. AS WELL AS OUR CONTRACT AND- WE CAN PROVIDE THAT DETAIL TO YOU AGAIN. VERY GOOD WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT MAY BE THAT- FOR FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT JUST THE VISUALS OF WHERE THE GRANT. THE GRANTS- HAVE GONE TO M. AND- THE TYPES OF BUSINESSES BYE BYE BYE CARE CATEGORY WOULD BE REAL HELPFUL FOR US TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER- HOW THAT. I THINK THAT THAT THE BUSINESSES THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT ARE ALL. WE HAVE ALL HAD PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT THOSE ARE THE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED THE MOST SO I APPRECIATE THAT THE DETAIL AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR- THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING OUR QUESTIONS WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON. TO THE OTHER TWO MEMBERS OF THE PANEL LIKE TO INVITE MARC HERBERT THE VICE PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY TO. TESTIFY WELCOME. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU A CHAIR VICE CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THIS AFTERNOON OR THIS MORNING RATHER ON A REALLY CRITICAL PROGRAM- I WORK REMOTELY SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY WERE NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION. AND WE WORK WITH SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TO HELP THEM TAKE THEIR NEXT STEP ON THEIR JOURNEY AND WE DO HUNDREDS OF EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS- AS WELL AS AND- ENSURE THAT THEIR VOICE IS PART OF POLICY CONVERSATIONS HERE IN SACRAMENTO AS WELL AS- OTHER STATE CAPITALS- AS A- DRUG TO USE MY MENTION THEIR FOUR POINT ONE MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES. AND AS IN THE US CENTERS MENTIONED. ROUGHLY OUT THE PRIVATE SECTOR LABOR FORCE IS EMPLOYED BY SMALL BUSINESSES THESE OF THE JOB CREATORS- AND WE CAN'T OVERSTATE ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT THIS PROGRAM IS. FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE SURVIVAL OF CALIFORNIA ENTREPRENEURS OUT WE STILL APPRECIATE THE VERY QUICK ACTION- THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHUT AND HOW QUICKLY THE LEGISLATURE IS MOVING NOW- TO REALLY BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE MOVE FAST I WITH. THE- APPROPRIATE I COUNTY ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THIS MOMENT WHERE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE HURTING AND IT NEEDS AHLERS ARE REACHING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. IN THE COMMUNITY- WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR GRANTS AS AN ORGANIZATION BOTH NATIONALLY AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CRISIS. WE KNOW THAT BUSINESS OWNERS I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE MONEY THAT THEY RECEIVE TO HELP THEM SURVIVE INTO HANG ON DURING THESE REALLY CHALLENGING TIMES AND THAT'S WHY THIS GRANT PROGRAM IS SO CRITICAL. WE RECENTLY RELEASED SOME POLLING LAST MONTH. THE TAKE A LOOK BACK AT HOW SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TO HAVE SURVIVED. THE HEARING CALIFORNIA OVER THE PAST TEN MONTHS. ROUGHLY A THIRD HAVE HAD TO CUT EMPLOYEE HOURS I 25% HAVE REDUCED EMPLOYEE WAGES. AT QUARTER HAVE HAD TO COMPLETELY CHANGE THEIR BUSINESS MODEL- AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE. FOR ENTREPRENEURS OF COLOR IN ENTREPRENEURS- IN UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES- AND 60% SAID THEY STILL HAVEN'T BROUGHT BACK- THEIR EMPLOYEES AND WE KNOW THIS THE DATABASE. ABOUT- THEN CENTERS YOU MENTION I THERE A LOT OF PERSONAL STORIES THAT HAVE ALL HEARD. AND BUSINESSES WHO BEEN YOU NEED EMPIRE- AND THE PROPOSAL SENT RIGHT NOW FOR SMALL USUALLY AS WE LOOK FORWARD. AS OUR POLLING SHOWS ROUGHLY 40% OF BUSINESSES- SIX SIX SAY THAT THEY ARE LIKELY TO DRAMATICALLY CHANGE HOW THEY DO BUSINESS IN ORDER TO SURVIVE. IN ORDER TO HANG ON I'M A FULL THIRTY A FULL THIRD. BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FURTHER CUT EMPLOYEE HOURS IN THE COMING MONTHS AND ANOTHER FOR THIRD BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO. REDUCE EMPLOYEE WAGES AGAIN IN THE COMING MONTHS- AND AS DIRECTED WAS MY MENTIONED EARLIER I WE HAVE A SURVEY EARLIER THIS YEAR SHOWING THAT ROUGHLY 40% OF BLACK ENTREPRENEURS WHERE REST OF CLOSING. AND NOW WE ALSO KNOW THAT ROUGHLY 60% ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR RENT OR THEIR MORTGAGE AND THERE'S SO MANY OTHER CHALLENGES. AND WE KNOW THAT PPP WAS HELPFUL FOR BUSINESSES OVER THE SUMMER- BUT AS WE RECALL MOST OF THAT WAS GOING TOWARD SALARIES AS IT SHOULD AS A PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM. BUT THERE'S SO MANY OTHER CHALLENGES THAT BUSINESS OWNERS ARE FACING AS THEY'RE TRYING TO HANG ON AS THEY'RE TRYING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR- CUSTOMERS OTHER BUSINESSES- 25% ARE BEHIND ON RENT PAYMENTS ON. DEBT PAYMENTS- AND A NUMBER HAVE MISSED THOSE PAYMENTS- AND SO THE LANDSCAPE REALLY CHALLENGING ESPECIALLY AS WE JUST CAME THROUGH THE HOLIDAY SEASON WITH MANY OF THOSE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS GET BACK INTO THE BLACK- AND WE WERE IN THE MIDST. OF A CHALLENGING- INCREASE. AND THE SPREAD OF THE PANDEMIC WHICH REQUIRED. US TO A SHOULD HAVE STAYED HOME ORDERS WHICH MADE EVEN MORE CHALLENGING FOR SMALL BUSINESSES- AND THAT'S WHY THIS GRANT PROGRAM IS SO IMPORTANT. TO MOVE SO QUICKLY AND TO MEET THIS MASSIVE MASSIVE MEDIA WE WERE PROUD. TO JOIN CALLOUS BA AND LENDINGTREE WE ARE ONE OF THOSE FIVE HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS- THAT THE DIRECTOR DOES NOT MENTION- THAT WERE- THAT STOOD UP AND WERE READY TO SUPPORT ENTREPRENEURS. AROUND THE STATE AS ACCESS. AND THIS THAT THIS GRANT PROGRAM. I'M AND I'M IS IT YOUR MOTHER PERSONALLY YOU. WE HAVE GREATLY ENJOYED PART WITH YOU- ON WEBINARS ABOUT ENGLISH AND SPANISH. FOR SMALL BUSINESSES IN YOUR DISTRICT I KNOW MY TEAM I REALLY APPRECIATE WORKING WITH YOUR TEAM AND WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE TO. THINK ABOUT WAYS WE CAN SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES AND ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SPONSORSHIP OF SB SEVENTY FOUR I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE- THE PURVIEW OF THIS. SPECIFIC OVERSIGHT HEARING BUT JUST MAKING SURE THAT THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT THE SCALE OF THE NEEDS CONTINUES TO BE FRIENDS CENTERS CRITICAL AND APPRECIATING YOUR- YOUR QUESTIONS EARLIER ABOUT HOW DO WE RIGHT SIZE THIS-PROBABLY PICKED THE RIGHT NUMBER. AND BECAUSE THE NEED IS JUST SO GREAT AND SO. WE APPRECIATE THE SPEED THAT WERE MOVING- AND APPRECIATE THINKING ABOUT SCALE AND HOW DO WE GET. TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY MEET THE NEEDS OF ENTREPRENEURS AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND IN COLLABORATION IS HUGE COLLABORATING WITH THE LEGISLATURE CRAP OF POVERTY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. WITH THE FIVE HUNDRED DIFFERENT. ORGANIZATIONS. AROUND THE STATE THAT WE ARE PROUD TO BE A PART OF. IS ESSENTIAL IN A MOMENT. I'M A AS WE JUST TALKED THE SCALE WE KNOW THAT NOT EVERY SMALL BUSINESS. IS GOING TO GET A GRANT- HAVE BUT WE KNOW THAT MANY OF THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND WE SEE THAT FROM THE DEMAND STILL NEED HELP. AT AND ONE OF THE REALLY GREAT PARTS OF THIS PROGRAM AND HOW IT WAS DESIGNED. WAS TO DRIVE MANY SMALL BUSINESSES. TO LOCAL RESOURCE PROVIDERS THAT OFFER FREE OR LOW COST SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORT. AND EVEN IF THEY DON'T GET A GRANT- WE KNOW THAT THEIR HOPEFULLY GETTING CONNECTED WITH. SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS OR NON PROFITS THAT SUPPORT ENTREPRENEURS OR POTENTIALLY SIGNIFIES THAT HAVE ACCESS TO OTHER TYPES OF CAPITAL PRODUCTS. TO HELP THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES. AND WE'RE PROUD TO BE A PART OF THAT EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE PARTNERS. ARE DOING EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN IN THIS MOMENT TO MEET THE NEED A SMALL BUSINESSES ACROS THE STATE- AND SO PROUD OF THIS PROGRAM THINK THAT PROGRAM DESIGN ELEMENT IS RELEASED. AS SIGNIFICANT AND IMPORTANT. TO MAKE SURE THAT BUSINESSES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY GET THE GRANT OR NOT. ARE GETTING CONNECTED INTO THEIR LOCAL SMALL BUSINESS ECOSYSTEM TO GET THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. TO HELP AND GIVE IT TO HELP THEM THINK ABOUT HOW DID THEY SURVIVE TO HELP THEM ACCESS TO OTHER TYPES OF RESOURCES. AND CAPITAL- THAT ARE OUT THERE AS WELL SO. WE KNOW SMALL BUSINESSES ARE FACING HUGE CHALLENGES IN THIS MOMENT- THIS PROPOSAL'S BOLD. WE APPRECIATE THAT AND WE HOPE THEY CAN MOVE QUICKLY AND NIMBLY- TO MEET THE NEEDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND APPRECIATE. AT THIS HEARING AND THE. OVERSIGHT OF THIS ALL IMPORTANT PROGRAM THANK YOU VERY. AND YOU FOR YOUR THEIR THE HELP THEM COLLABORATION YOU'VE DONE WITH THIS GRANT PROGRAM. OUR NEXT WE'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM LUCY SALCEDO. CARTER PUBLIC POLICY DIRECTOR FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF NONPROFITS WELCOME. THANK YOU CHECK OUT BY IT ALL AND SENATOR NELSON FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR TODAY I AM LUCY SALCEDO CARTER THE PUBLIC POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF NONPROFIT SO WE CALL IT CAL NONPROFITS FOR SHORT. CAL NONPROFITS IS A POLICY ALLIANCE OF MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND ORGANIZATIONS AND THE VOICE OF CALIFORNIANS NONPROFIT COMMUNITY. WE ADVOCATE FOR POLICIES THAT PROTECT AND PROMOTE THE NONPROFIT SECTOR. WE ARE ALSO A CONTRACTED APPLICATION PARTNER FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF GRANTS PROGRAM IT'LL JUST CALL THE RELIEF PROGRAM WE'RE GLAD TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT NONPROFITS APPLYING FOR THESE GRANTS AND WE ALSO WANT TO THANK DIRECTOR GOOSE MON FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN MAKING THAT HAPPEN. MY COMMENTS TODAY REFLECT OUR EXPERIENCES IN THAT ROLE AND THE FEEDBACK THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN FROM HUNDREDS OF NONPROFITS REGARDING THE PROGRAM. OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT NONPROFITS NEED.

WHAT WHAT WILL BE PATIENT I THINK SHE MAY COME BACK. THANK HELLO. YEAH THE I FOCUSED SPECIFICALLY. MS CARTER YOU HAVE FROZEN ON OUR SCREEN. I WANT TO FOCUS TO GET CAN YOU HEAR ME I.

THIS IS LUCY SALCEDO CARTER CAN YOU ALL HEAR ME NOW WE CAN THANK YOU FOR CALLING ACT YEAH THEY HAVE BEEN TECHNOLOGY SPEAKING OF TECHNOLOGY- SO I'LL CONTINUE I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHERE I CUT OUT THAT- I'LL JUST MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT I WANTED TO FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON THE NONPROFIT EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PROGRAM- I WANNA SAY FIRST THAT. WERE REALLY. GRATEFUL THAT OUR PROFITS ARE INCLUDED IN THE RELIEF PROGRAM- 98% OF NONPROFITS ARE SMALL. NONPROFITS LIKE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE IMPORTANT JOB CREATORS AND ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTORS MANY NONPROFITS ARE STRUGGLING TO STAY AFLOAT DURING THE PANDEMIC AS YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD ABOUT WITH- SMALL BUSINESSES AS WELL MANY ARE RESPONDING TO INCREASED COMMUNITY NEED WITHOUT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. WHILE OTHERS HAVE HAD TO CLOSE AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OPEN AS MANY AS A THIRD. THE RELIEF PROGRAM GRANTS AREN'T LARGE BUT THEY CAN BE A LIFELINE FOR NONPROFITS AND YOU'VE SEEN THAT INTEREST BY NONPROFITS IN THIS GRANT OPPORTUNITY HAS BEEN REMARKABLY STRONG. BUT THE RELIEF PROGRAM APPLICATION PROCESS HAS ALSO BEEN DIFFICULT. FOR NONPROFITS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. FIRST ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SEPARATE APPLICATIONS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS MANY OF THE TERMS USED IN THE NONPROFIT APPLICATION ARE UNFAMILIAR OR IRRELEVANT FOR NON PROFITS. FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE NONPROFIT LEADERS ARE NOT CONSIDERED OWNERS OF THE NONPROFIT. IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR NONPROFIT APPLICANTS TO COMPLETE ANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT ASK ABOUT. ASK FOR OWNER INFORMATION. SECONDLY SEVERAL OF THE QUESTIONS THAT ASK APPLICANTS TO CHOOSE AMONG A FINITE SET OF BUSINESS TYPES OR INDUSTRIES NONE OF WHICH ARE RELEVANT FOR MOST NONPROFITS. IT IT COMPELS NONPROFITS TO SELECT AN INACCURATE ANSWER THAT MIGHT AFFECT THEIR CHANCES OF GETTING A GRANT- AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY CONCERNING- IF THESE QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT PRIORITIZING CERTAIN INDUSTRIES- FOR ELIGIBILITY FOR THE GRANT. SO IN ADDITION SOME OF THE INFORMATION REQUIRED IN THE APPLICATION IS INFORMATION NON PROFITS ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED PROVIDING ON GRANT APPLICATIONS NONPROFIT LEADERS ARE NOT TYPICALLY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A PERSONAL SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND DATE OF BIRTH OR BE SUBJECT TO ANY KIND OF PERSONAL CREDIT CHECK AS PART OF A- GRANT APPLICATION PROCESS. A TAX ID NUMBER FOR AN ORGANIZATION WOULD BE MUCH BETTER CHOICE FOR NONPROFITS AND WOULD GIVE A MORE ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF THE NONPROFIT APPLICANT I'M AND FINALLY SOME OF THE REQUIRED DOCUMENTS ARE DIFFICULT FOR NONPROFIT APPLICANTS TO OBTAIN ON SHORT NOTICE. GIVEN THAT THEY ARE NOT DOCUMENTS TYPICALLY REQUIRED WHEN NONPROFITS APPLY FOR GRANTS. THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AS ONE EXAMPLE NONPROFITS DON'T TYPICALLY HAVE THAT AT THEIR FINGERTIPS. I DO WANT TO SAY THAT WALK UP WITH THAT AS WE HAVE RAISED THESE ISSUES WITH THE INTERMEDIARY L'INDUSTRIE. WE'VE GOTTEN INFORMATION ABOUT HOW NONPROFITS CAN COMPLETE SOME OF THE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS AS WELL AS WORK AROUNDS FOR SOME OF THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS. BUT NONPROFITS ARE ST STILL STRUGGLING. TO FIT SQUARE PEGS INTO ROUND HOLES. SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES DISCOURAGE SOME NON PROFITS FROM APPLYING AT ALL FRANKLY SO- THEY SERVED AS A AND UNINTENDED GATEKEEPING FUNCTION THEY ALSO CAUSED UNDUE STRESS FOR MANY WHO DID GO THROUGH THE APPLICATION PROCESS. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY AND APPLICATION PROCESS THAT FAILS TO GIVE NONPROFITS A CHANCE TO ACCURATELY DESCRIBE THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND NEEDS. ALSO FAILS TO PROVIDE THE BEST INFORMATION FOR ASSESSING WHICH ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD RECEIVE A GRANT. THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC ACCOUNT ON PROFITS HAS ADVOCATED FOR RELIEF PROGRAMS FOR NON PROFITS COMPARABLE TO THE RELIEF PROGRAMS FOR PROFIT ENTITIES. WORK FOR CALIFORNIA'S NONPROFITS IS VITAL FOR THE STATE'S SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN FOR ITS JOB MARKET AND FOR THE ECONOMY. THE SECTOR IS THE FOURTH LARGEST EMPLOYER BY INDUSTRY IN THE STATE AND GENERATES 15% OF THE GROSS STATE PRODUCT. THE STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COUNTY NONPROFITS TO PROVIDE A VARIETY OF STATE SERVICE OF VITAL SERVICES THE CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING THIRTY TWO PERCENT. OF MEDICAL SERVICES. NONPROFITS ARE ON THE GROUND IN AND PART OF UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE CURRENT AMOUNT ALLOCATED FOR THE RELIEF PROGRAM AS WELL AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IS NOT ENOUGH BY A LONG MEASURE TO ADDRESS THE FINANCIAL NEEDS OF NONPROFIT SMALL BUSINESSES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE MAGNITUDE OF THE NEED IS CLEAR EVEN JUST FROM THE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND APPLICANTS THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE FIRST ROUND. HELLO PROFITS IS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ADDITIONAL STATE RESOURCES FOR RELIEF PROGRAMS FOR NONPROFITS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. AND WE SUPPORT THE- THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS IN THE- GOVERNOR'S- PROPOSED BUDGET AS WELL AS SB SEVENTY FOUR. GOING FORWARD HOWEVER RELIEF PROGRAMS SHOULD HAVE A DISTINCT APPLICATION. PROCESS FOR NON PROFITS. THAT REFLECTS THE NONPROFIT EXPERIENCE INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE MISSION APPLICATION QUESTIONS SHOULD ALLOW NONPROFITS TO ACCURATELY DESCRIBE THEIR FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS THEY MAKE TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL ECONOMIES. THE SMALL SIZE OF THE CURRENT PROGRAMS GRANTS ALSO WARRANTS A SIMPLER APPLET APPLICATION PROCESS FRANKLY- FOR ALL NONPROFITS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT SIMPLE OUR APPLICATION PROCESS WILL BE LESS WORK FOR EVERYONE INCLUDING FOUR L'INDUSTRIE AND CALLOW SPLA. SO FINALLY I JUST WANT ALSO- MAKE A POINT THAT OTHERS HAVE MADE AS WELL PROGRAM DATA IS NEEDED THE PROGRAM DATA THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE NUMBER AND PERCENTAGE OF NONPROFIT GRANT RECIPIENTS WOULD REALLY BE HELPFUL INCLUDING THEIR DEMOGRAPHIC AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PROGRAM IS REACHING NONPROFITS AND THE COMMUNITIES IN MOST NEED SO WITH THAT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME APOLOGIES FOR THE TECHNOLOGY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND- AND YOUR PERSISTENCE AS WELL FOR JOINING US BACK AGAIN HE MADE SOME REALLY GOOD POINTS I GUESS SOME LET ME START OFF WITH- YOU MISS CARTER- YOU RAISE SOME REALLY GOOD ISSUES- AND I'M WONDERING. IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA BASED ON THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY WE NEED IN THE POT FOR NON PROFITS IN ORDER FOR US TO I YOU KNOW BEST CASE SCENARIO- JUST. I GUESS PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE IS THAT WE ALWAYS SEEM TO BE WORKING IN A VACUUM AND WE WERE NOT REALLY SURE THAT THE DATA WE HAVE IN REGARDS TO LANDLORD TENANT SMALL BUSINESSES- THAT THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER THAT WE CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF- OF THEM NONPROFITS THAT THAT YOU THINK WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS KIND OF A GRANT PROGRAM. AND SHOULD BE. EVEN IF IT'S AS I REMEMBER I JUST. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IS THAT- THEY'RE A LOT THERE ARE A LOT OF NON PROFITS THAT ARE ALSO ALL VOLUNTEER BUT THEY PROVIDE CRITICAL SERVICES SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATIONS OF PPP FOR EXAMPLE. THE PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM DOES DOES NOT ALSO INCLUDE AND VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATIONS SO I MEAN IT- DIRECTOR GOOSE MON MENTIONED A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND NONPROFITS- IN THAT FIT IN THE CATEGORIES THAT ARE ELIGIBLE SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER. I MEAN ONE WAY WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT IS WE COULD TAKE A PERCENTAGE OF THE OVERALL FUNDS AND SET THEM ASIDE FOR NON PROFITS WE ARE PROPOSES THE NUMBER 15% BECAUSE WE CONTRIBUTE. 15% THE STATE GROSS PRODUCT- SO THAT'S JUST ONE. ONE THING TO CONSIDER- BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF NONPROFITS ARE STRUGGLING- YOU KNOW SO COMPARABLE TO SMALL THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY- AND IT IT I THINK IT WAS SENATOR SKINNER WHO POINTED OUT THAT THE COMMUNITY IS VERY VERY. BUT EVEN- PROFITS THAT ARE PROVIDING ESSENTIAL SERVICES ARE BEING TAXED- BY THE NEEDS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES AND NOT ALWAYS GETTING THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES SO- SO I CAN'T GIVE YOU WHAT YOU KNOW AND- A- DOLLAR AMOUNT TO BUT- BUT I DID PROPOSE A PERCENTAGE AND I. WOULD BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT THIS WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND OF COURSE BE ADMINISTRATION AND OTHERS. WHAT WELL THAT WAY OF ANALYZING IT IS REALLY HELPFUL BECAUSE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO COME UP WITH A NUMBER BUT- 15% THAT'S RELATED. TO THE CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECONOMY MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT CREATIVE OUTSIDE IT RIGHT OUTSIDE OF THE BOX- AT THINKING AND THEN- I GUESS THAT THE OTHER PART WOULD BE- ARE YOU WILLING TO WORK ON A APPLICATION THAT YOU THINK WOULD. WOULD MORE APPROPRIATELY. CAPTURED THAT. THE DATA THAT WOULD BE NEEDED. FOR THIS KIND OF A PROGRAM. IF THIS PROGRAM MOVES FORWARD AND THERE'S MORE MONEY PUT IN I THINK I THINK I THINK THERE'S- VERY GREAT CONCERN OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO. JUMPSTART THE ECONOMY AND THIS IS ONE WAY TO DO IT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- PROVIDE AN ELEMENT TO SURVIVABILITY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE NONPROFIT SO. SO I SEE THIS MOVING FORWARD I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE BEST PROGRAM IN THAT WERE REALLY CAPTURING DATA THAT WE NEED. TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS. SO THE QUESTION WOULD BE- I WOULD BE HONORED YOUR SUGGESTIONS THAT. THAT THE APPLICATION BE MUCH MORE TAILORED TOWARDS THE NONPROFIT WORLD HAVING RUN A NONPROFIT FOR SIX YEARS I HAVE. A REAL SENSITIVITY TO THAT AND IF YOU HAVE TO TRY TO EXPLAIN WHAT YOU DO. IN LITTLE CHECK BOXES YOU KIND OF LOSE. LOSE THE IMPACT OF THE WORK THAT YOU AS A NONPROFIT DO SO- I. WOULD BE HONORED TO PARTICIPATE AND WORKING ON MAKING AN APPLICATION THAT IS REALLY. MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR NONPROFITS AND REFLECTS THE WONDERFUL WORK THEY DO IN THE CONTRIBUTIONS THEY MAKE THAT'S VERY GOOD. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT AND- A QUESTION FOR MARKER BURKE I APPRECIATED THE COMMENTS. ABOUT THE POLLING INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDED IT IS EXCELLENT- IT'S- THERE. AS I SAY SOMETIMES WE- WE STRUGGLE BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T GET THE GOOD GOOD DATA ON WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT IN THE WORLD WE- GET VIGNETTES FROM. SMALL BUSINESSES. CALLING US AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS AND FROM DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS- THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE IN IN- IN THAT HELPING TO. HELPING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN SURVIVE AND REOPEN EVEN IF THEY'VE HAD TO CHANGE THEIR BUSINESS MODEL- TOUGH TIME SOMETIMES. IS IT IS CREATES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR INVENTION- IT WILL BE WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH HOW MUCH. WE NEED TO PUT IN THIS PART DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT THE NEED IS AND WHAT IS AN APPROPRIATE NUMBER THAT THAT. WE SHOULD BE STRIVING FOR MEN AGAIN WE'VE GOT A LOT OF A LOT OF NEEDS IN THE STATE THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE SOME TOUGH CHOICES BUT I'M TRYING TO. GET MY HEAD AROUND WHAT. WHAT SHOULD WE BE LOOKING. TO PUT INTO THIS INTO THIS RESOURCE. IT IS A VERY CHALLENGING QUESTION AT APPRECIATE THAT CENTER AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS HEARING- I'D BE HAPPY TO IT TO COME BACK TO YOU WITH SOME RECOMMENDATIONS JUST BASED ON WHAT WE'VE SEEN- THROUGH A PPP DOLLARS THAT HIT THE MARKET IN THE SUMMER ALL RIGHT I THINK IT WAS ALMOST A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN PPP AND I'D ALL. THE B. AND ANOTHER THIRTY SOMETHING IN IN IDLE- AND MANY OF THOSE BUSINESSES MAY NOT MAKE IT AND SO I THINK THAT THE SHEER SCALE AND WE THINK ABOUT HALF OUR ECONOMY- AND THIS SIZE. RIGHT HALF OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE STRUGGLING AS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE ARE ARE HAVING CHALLENGES AND BRIGHT SOME OF OUR POLLING SHOWS THAT. 60% HAVE NOT REHIRED- BACK TO THE PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS SO WE KNOW THAT THE DATE IS TELLING US THE SCALE IS SOMETHING WE'VE QUITE HONESTLY NOT SEEN BEFORE AND SO BEING ABLE TO RIGHT SIZE THE SOLUTION IS CHALLENGING I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW WE THINK WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET THERE- BUT I THINK AT THIS MOMENT MORE THAN ANYTHING IS. HOW CAN WE MOVE QUICKLY TO MAKE SURE THAT AS BUSINESSES ARE HANGING ON THAT WE NEED THEM WHERE WE ARE OUR MAIN CONCERN IS THAT AS TIME GOES BY MORE AND MORE BUSINESSES JUST CAN'T HANG ON ANYMORE- AND WE'RE CREATING A SCENARIO WHERE IN THE SPRING I WE'RE GONNA HAVE. A LOT OF BUSINESSES THAT HAVE FAILED IN THE QUESTION IS AND WHAT DOES THAT DO TO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND WHAT DOES THAT DO TO OUR ECONOMY. AND TILT. BIGGER IS BETTER HE INTO OF. SILVA AND WE'RE- THAT FEDERAL. HAS FINALISED IN- BUT REALLY THE LEADERSHIP OF THE STATE TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. IS I IS SUCH A- IT'S SUCH A HUGE STEP FORWARD. I'M SO HAPPY TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL DETAIL FOR ALL HAPPY TO PASS ALONG THE POLLING THAT WE JUST RELEASED THAT I REFERENCED- BUT ALSO AT THIS SCALE IS SO BIG. IT'S HARD TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WHAT A RIGHT SIZE SOLUTION BE WHEN YOU THINK OF THE CONTEXT OF WHAT THE STATE HAS ALREADY RECEIVED IN FEDERAL RELIEF. BUT WHAT THE NEED IS AND THEN I THINK THE REAL QUESTION IS- AS AS A CENTER SKINNER AND IS YOU ALSO- I'M SURE I'VE HAD MENTIONED IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT IT'S TARGETED THE BUSINESSES THAT. NEED IT THE MOST- AND THAT'S WHAT THE SCORING CRITERIA THAT- CALLOUSED BA AND L'INDUSTRIE PUT TOGETHER SO EFFECTIVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF POWER HERE IN CALIFORNIA. HOW DO WE TARGET THOSE BUSINESSES IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HAD STAYED HOME ORDERS. THAT HAVE BEEN UNIQUELY IMPACTED- BY THE PANDEMIC I WHERE THE INDUSTRIES- WHO WHO ARE UNDER A RESOURCE OPTION ENTREPRENEURS THAT WE NEED TO SERVE. ALL THOSE SCORING CRITERIA ARE ABOUT PRIORITIZING THE BUSINESSES. THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN LEFT BEHIND OR WHO MAY NOT HAVE RECEIVED AS MUCH OF THE FEDERAL LEAF- BUT THE WHOLE BUT IN TERMS OF SCALE IF YOU NEED HELP. AND HOW MUCH HELP IS NEEDED AND IS- IT IS SIGNIFICANT AND BIGGER THAN- THAT WE SEEN AND SO AGAIN. SO APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR LEGISLATION TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE CONVERSATION- TWO BIGGER AND BOULDER PLACES AND SB SEVENTY FOUR AND- PLEASE LET US KNOW HOW WE CAN HELP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE QUESTION IS. WHAT SHOULD THE NUMBER BE APPRECIATE THAT. CENTER NEAL- MISSED WHETHER FOR YOU'RE STILL THERE. THE- CONCERN I HAVE AGAIN IS WITH THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES THEY'RE ON THE BRINK. AND I'M FEARFUL THAT WE ARE NOT KEEPING CLOSE ENOUGH TRACK. ON THE BIG PICTURE HERE AS IT EVOLVES AND MAYBE SOMETIMES DEVOLVES WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED I HAD LUNCH MONDAY AT A LITTLE RESTAURANT IN THE REASON BASEBALL TOWN. THERE WAS NOBODY IN THAT RESTAURANT. EVEN NOW. AND THAT REALLY ALARMING IT'S A MOTHER AND HER DAUGHTER. IN THE STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE AND THEY ARE ON THE BRINK. AND I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THE THING WILL. ARE YOU TO MISTER WHETHER FOR ARE YOU A KEEP AN EYE ON THESE. FAILURE ISN'T AND HOW MUCH HOW CLOSE TO THE BREAK SOME ARE AND HOW WE CAN REDIRECT MONEY TO THEM AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. JUST TO KEEP THEM GOING THIS IS- NOT JUST LONG TERM THIS IS. IMMEDIATE AND URGENT AND WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A BIG PROGRAM ANNOUNCED THAT IS BUT A FALSE HOPE. ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY. SUFFICIENTLY THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND RECRUITING DIRECT RESOURCES TO THEM QUICKLY. WELL WE CERTAINLY ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON THE- THE GENERAL ECONOMIC SITUATION I THINK GETTING DATA- AT THE LEVEL YOU'RE SUGGESTING. IS VERY DIFFICULT AND A PROGRAM SUCH AS AS THIS ONE- WHERE IT'S WHO WORDS REQUESTING- THE BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE THEIR- THEIR THEIR ACTUAL DECLINE IN REVENUE- I THINK LATER IN IN- IN THE COMING WEEKS ALSO HEAR ABOUT THE MAIN STREET HIRING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM WHICH ALSO- TRACKS- DECLINES IN REVENUE AND- PROVIDES RELIEF BASED ON THAT. IS A LITTLE BIT MORE EFFECTIVE SO WE ARE TRYING TO GET THE DATA THAT IS AVAILABLE. HE POINTED MANY OF BUSINESSES- ARE AFFECTED- MORE THAN AND- THE EXTENT WE CAN OUR PROGRAM TO THOSE- ON YOUR DEPEND IF IT DOESN'T MOST OF IS PROBABLY THE BEST USE OF THE LIVE AMOUNT OF RESOURCE. WELL IT SEEMS TO BE OUT NOT VERY THAT YOU HAVE MADE. LEAD OFFICE THAT. THIS SEPARATE MAY NOT HAVE RECEIVED IMPACT ON. X. ON WHAT OF DATA. OR BACK DOORS DID THE ANALYST BAY THAT THAT WE HAVE LITTLE. ON THE- SO THIS ECONOMY IS X. LARGE AND- SO EXAMPLE- IS MORE CURRENT MENTIONED- THE FEDERAL THE FIRST ROUND AND- PEOPLE LEARNS ABOUT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THE- THE IDEA ALONE- ASSISTANCE WAS- AROUND THIRTY BILLION- THIS- PASSAGE TO ADDITION FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BUSINESS IS JUST. X. LIMITED IN COMPARISON TO THAT- THAT CITED THE BUSINESS RECEIVE THE ASSISTANCE- I OFTEN MUCH SMALLER THEN- THE BUSINESS AND CERTAIN AFFECTS THEM- BENEFITS INTO LEVEL MUCH BUT THIS OF OUR OF OUR MULTI TRILLION DOLLAR STATE ECONOMY IT'S JUST REAL SMALL. WHAT MADE UNDER SAME CLASS FOR THE OF FROM. THE IS THE OF FINANCE SAYS TO THESE THIS AND DOES. UP AND OF- ALEX THE- GETTING SO OF THE SMALLER BUSINESS. VERY VERY SOON SILICON HAVE THEM THE M. OF THE POOREST IF YOU WERE THEN GOING OUT OF I SAY GOING TO SAY THEM. AND GET THEM ACCOUNTS. SANDRA UNTIL THE OVERALL ECONOMY ZIPS UP BUT- THIS IS PART OF FINANCIAL THE SENSE FOR ARE YOU SENSE OF TO THIS. UP IF WILL. PLEASE THANK YOU YES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS CENTER TO THE NEEDS OF THIS BUSINESS- AND TRYING TO KEEP THEM GOING- YOU KNOW ON THE ECONOMY RECOVERY UNTIL WE HAVE A WIDE OUT ABOUT ROLE OUT- AND LIKE THAT SO WE ARE TO- THANK YOU SAID FORCE HO KEEP THAT LIGHT ON I KEEP PEOPLE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE- TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE. WELL RIGHT NOW THE WHAT THEY- IS. A RAY OF. BUT THEY NOT NEED OF PROMISE. THE DOES NOT DELIVER. NOT THIS IS A BIG THE- HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BILLS AND STATE. A GOOD FOR OF THEM ARE OF GREAT SOMEONE MAY SOME OF THEM. RE MINOR. BUT IS IMPORTANT FOR A THE NOT ALL THEM FALSE HOPE. SO I WOULD ASK THAT YOU BE VERY STEADIER. AND ENSURING THAT MONIES GET THEM. S. AS POSSIBLE. AND ONE ON AS WELL OR RATHER CLASS. ARE THERE A LOT OF THE REPORT AND THAT CAN. IMPEDIMENTS ARE DEMAND ON THESE THAT IT IS HARD FOR THEM TO GET THAT DATA TOGETHER TO SUBMIT TO THE GRANTING AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS. THE RED TAPE IN OTHER WORDS. SEVENTY TIME HAPPY TO JUMP IN AT THE WELCOME AS WE BELIEVE SO WE BELIEVE THAT WE PUT A CONTROL THAT WERE CAN THE NEW FOR EXT. OUT TO GET THESE FUN OUT- BUT STILL HAVE CONTROLS- TO LIMIT THE FRAUD WASTE AND ABUSE AND SO YOU'RE COMING UP WITH EITHER YOUR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN TAX RETURNS AND PROVIDING SOME BASIC INFORMATION IN TERMS OF YOUR- YOU KNOW ANY ANY ESTABLISH SECRETARY OF STATE OR LOCAL LICENSES IS REALLY SHOULDN'T BE UNREASONABLE- AND THIS IS PUBLIC BENEFITS THIS IS A PUBLIC FUNDS AND SO WE HAVE TO BE PRUDENT. AND ENSURE THAT SOME OF THAT INFORMATION I IS TRACK SO THAT WE CAN LIMIT FIVE WAYS TO BE SO I DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE SO I THINK THAT IT WAS A SIMPLE PROGRAM BALANCED WITH- THE NEED FOR BOTH. IN CONTROL AS WELL AS SIMPLY FOR THE-BUSINESS. THANK YOU AND GOOD ONE MORE QUESTION. IN THE- OPERATOR OF THE YOUR FOR. AGENTS THE ALL IS SMALL THAT. DO YOU HAVE ANY RECALL. UNDER MINUTES LOCK FOR PROMULGATING REGULATE TO DO WHAT NEED TO DO. OR CAN YOU THE EFFECT BY EIGHT. MOVE AHEAD. IS THERE A REGULATORY YOU HAVE GOT TO GO THROUGH TO GET MONEY SENT OUT. WE HAVE A THE PAST ON UNDER PRO ON RULES OF EXAMPLE ON A TWO SAYS EXPAND PROGRAM- ON ON THIS ONE OF THE WE THE- INTO OUT AND RULES ENGAGEMENT WITHIN THE ARE PROCESS. THE REQUESTED PROCESS WHERE WE DEFINED ELIGIBILITY WE DEFINE PRIORITIES WE DEFINE DAD TIMING EXCEPT. AND I TREAT YOU WITH AND YOUR HIGH ALREADY YOUR FOR ORGANIZATION AS A ALL AGENCIES GOVERNMENT. THE BEAVER OPEN AND- WITH THE LEGISLATURE. FILL THAT WE CAN HAVE RIGHT IN. TO THE PEOPLE WE READ. AND THEM NOT BE FOR HOPE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU MUCH- AND I WANTED IT THAT PART AS A PAN ON PANEL APPRECIATE YOUR I THINK THE YOU MAY MY OF YOU MAY AROUND FOR THE PANEL I LOOKING TO IF. BUT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO PASS NUMBER TWO AT SO YOU THANK YOU VERY. AND THIS IS THE GOLDEN STATE STEMMING- DISCUSS I AM I'D LIKE TO. CALL ON JANE J. CHAMBER. THE CHEAP UP FRONT READ APART OF FINANCE. I WOULD START WITH YOU. THIS. SO I HAD TO NAME ST JAMES PARTNER FINANCE SO THE GOLD STREET IS A- THAT AIMS TO QUICKLY MONEY THE PARK OF THE GROUP OF CAL.

EITHER SEND CHECKS TO OR MAKE DIRECT DEPOSITS INTO ACCOUNTS OF TAXPAYERS RECEIVE THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT FOR THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TAX YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. IN ADDITION TAXPAYERS WITH INDIVIDUAL TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS WHO QUALIFY FOR THE EITC FOR CALIFORNIA IF YOU SEE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TEXTURE WHICH IS THE FIRST YEAR THERE THE BEATLES BEFORE THE ATC THEY WILL ALSO RECEIVE A SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR.

IN TOTAL THIS PROGRAMS IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE CASH ASSISTANCE TO ROUGHLY FOUR MILLION LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY PREPARED COMMENTS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE COMMENTS AND I ALSO WANT TO MENTION YOU ARE NET COMMITTEE FROM THE- FOR LEGISLATIVE. SERVICES DIRECTOR FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IS ALSO AVAILABLE TO ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT. ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I'D LIKE TO INVITE THAT CASH ALAMO THE PRINCIPLE FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU TRAVIS ALLEN- WITH THE L. A. L. OUR OFFICE PRODUCED A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNOR'S GOLD STATES TO MOST PROPOSAL TODAY ON THE COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE AS WELL AS A PARTS I'LL BE WORKING LARGELY OFF OF THAT BUT JUST A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS- AS WE ALL KNOW THE- EFFECT OF THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN WIDESPREAD AFFECTING. ALL WORKERS IN AND ALL OF US- BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S BECOME CLEAR THAT THE EFFECTIVE DISPROPORTIONATELY- ON LOW WAY WORKERS PARTY OF THE INTO AT THE MOST OF TYPE HEALTH ORDER. AT THE SAME TIME THE COST FOR SAYS AND FOR ARE SPEND MORE AND ARE THEY SPEND MORE TIME WITH. FOR- THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC HELLO ARMENPRESS FEDERAL LEAVE. HAVE A- MOST AND- AND THAT THE JEWS HAVE ALL. BRING UP OUR FIRST FOREMOST- ENHANCED PLAN INSURANCE BENEFITS. ARE THERE WERE INCLUDED IN PART OF THE CARES ACT- AS AN EXAM OF A MINIMUM WAGE WORKER. WHO BECAME UNEMPLOYED AND RECEIVE HESE RIGHT BUT IF IT'S A TYPICALLY EARNED. ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS A WEEK AND WAY. ON AND UNDER THE IN BENEFITS I'LL- IN THE SPRING AND SUMMER WAS RECEIVING ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY DOLLARS IN WEEKLY ALIVE BENEFITS. AND WOULD RECEIVE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY. OUR A WEEK YOU LIVE. ARE THE REASON FEDERAL. ON IN THE AS A LAWSUIT OF UP MAGNITUDE THE U. I. BENEFITS ADDITIONALLY- THE TWO ROUNDS OF FEDERAL STIMULUS TRACKS ARE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO FAMILIES HAVE GREATLY HELPED. STABILIZE MOST HOUSEHOLDS FAMILY INCOMES ON BUT- WHILE THESE PROGRAMS HAVE HELPED MOST LOW INCOME CALIFORNIAN HOUSEHOLDS ARE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS IN PARTICULAR HAVE NOT BEEN ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE TO THESE FEDERALLY PROGRAMS ON AND MINDFUL OF THAT LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE TOOK TWO ACTIONS TO SUPPORT THIS GROUP OF WORKERS OUR FIRST CREATING THE DISASTER RELIEF ASSISTANCE FOR IMMIGRANTS PROGRAM A GRANT PROGRAM FOR UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS. IN THE SPRING AND SUMMER OF LAST YEAR AND AS WELL EXPANDING THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT TO BE AVAILABLE TO A TO TAX FILERS WHO FILE USING- INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OF OTHERWISE KNOWN AS A HIGH TECH- ABOUT HALF OF THE STATE'S UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS FILE STATE TAXES USING AND HIGH TECH- I WON'T GO THROUGH THE SPECIFICS OF IT THE PROPOSAL ITSELF IS RESEARCHING WIND AND ALL MOVE FORWARD DIRECTLY TO SORT OF OUR ASSESSMENT AND NOT RAISED A COUPLE OF POINTS OUT THE FIRST IS THAT. GENERALLY SPEAKING USING ONE TIME FUNDS- FOR PANDEMIC LEAVE AT THIS POINT MAKES SENSE- THE STATE IS THAT RECEIVER ONE TIME REVENUE WINDFALL. FALL BY YOURS AS WE ESTIMATE OF. BUDGET STRUCTURAL DEFICITS AND SO USING ONE TIME RESOURCES NOW OPT FOR ONE TIME RELIEF EFFORTS FIX FISCAL SENSE. I'M BUT THE SAME TIME. THE PAYMENT SOME DON'T. ARE LIKELY TO BE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE STATE'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY- AND THIS ISN'T. I JUST THINK THE PROGRAM ITSELF IS JUST A- RECOGNITION THAT AFTER TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL IS RELATIVELY SMALL IN THE CONTEXT OF THE OVERALL STATE ECONOMY I REPRESENTS ABOUT ONE TENTH OF THE THIRD POINT. IS SORT OF RELATED TO THE SECOND THAT WE POINT OUT IN OUR ASSESSMENT IS THAT BECAUSE THAT IS THE STIMULUS EFFECT ISN'T FIRST AND FOREMOST- ONE OF THE KEY GOALS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. OUT WE POINT OUT THAT INSTEAD FOCUSING ON FILLING IN THE GAPS WERE FEDERAL LEAVE HAS NOT BEEN AVAILABLE I SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE STATE. OF WHICH HE'S FUNDS. AND AS SUCH IT'S NOT CLEAR TO OUR OFFICE THEY'RE PRIORITIZING THE TWENTY NINETEEN. CAL E. I. T. C. RECIPIENTS- ON IS THAT THE BEST APPROACH AT THIS TIME IN PART BECAUSE MANY OF THESE WORKERS THOUGH CERTAINLY SOME OF WHOM HAVE SUFFERED JOB LOSSES DURING THE PANDEMIC. HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS I MENTIONED BEFORE AND THOSE FROM THE PROGRAMS ARE WILL HELP STABILIZE THESE HOUSEHOLD INCOME- ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE SOME OTHER LIMITATIONS USING THE KEPT THE EITC TARGETING MECHANISM- FIRST AND FOREMOST THAT ABOUT 20% OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE EITC DO NOT CLAIM IT AND SO USING THIS MECHANISM WOULDN'T REACH THOSE HOUSEHOLDS AND SECONDARILY. ON THE KEY ADVANTAGES OF THE EITC FROM A RESEARCH STANDPOINT- FIRST AND FOREMOST THAT THEY'RE PROVIDES WORK AND EDUCATIONAL AND SOME HEALTH BENEFITS TO THE HOUSEHOLDS THAT THE RECEIVE THE CALIFORNIA E. I. T. C. DON'T NECESSARILY EXTEND TO THIS PROGRAM THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S A ONE TIME PAYMENT- IT ALSO DOESN'T VARY WITH INCOME AS THE EITC DOES IN ITS ONGOING FORMULATION ARE RATHER MINISTRATIONS PROPOSED TO USE THE I. T. ACT YOU SEE SORT OF AS A WAY TO IDENTIFY THESE HOUSEHOLDS RATHER THAN. AS A WAY TO FURTHER OF THE BENEFITS. OF THE EITC PROGRAM ITSELF. I'M SORRY THINK. YOU FOR WITH A RED. WE NOW A GOOD TIME TO LET COMES CONSIDER OTHER APPROACHES TO INTERVIEW THE SORT OF ONE OVER ARCHING QUESTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER AS IT AS IT CONTEMPLATES THIS. AND THAT IS WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO HELP LOW IN CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AT THIS TIME. I'M ON ON PAGE OF OUR HAND I WILL SEVERAL QUESTIONS I WILL GO THROUGH THEM IN PARTICULAR BUT WE USE THESE QUESTIONS OF A FILTERING PROCESS TO. HELP IDENTIFY GROUPS THAT THE STATE COULD ARE MOST. OF PRIORITIZE FUNDS FOR AT THIS POINT IN THE FIRST QUESTION. IS SIMPLY WHO HAS BENEFITED LEAST FROM FEDERALLY EFFORTS GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF. THE FEDERALLY- RAMS ADVANCED SUCH A AND DOWN THE CAMP. I BEGINNING ON PAGE OF OUR HAND OUT OUTLAW AN APPROACH ALLEGE COULD CONSIDER AN WE CALLED HIM HARD AT A RELATIVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON JUST A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS ON THIS APPROACH. IN ESSENCE- BECAUSE ON. WORKERS HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT JOB LOSSES BUT NOT BENEFITTED FROM FEDERAL INCOME SUPPORT THE LEGISLATURE COULD NARROW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE A LARGER BENEFIT SO LARGER THAN THE SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR ONE TIME. I'M TO A SMALLER GROUP OF WORKERS- SPECIFICALLY I TEN FILERS WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS AND NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL BENEFITS- THEY ARE TARGETED APPROACH SUCH AS THIS WOULD GET. I'M MONEY OUT SOMEWHAT FASTER THAN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR I. TEN FILERS BECAUSE WE PROPOSE TO. MAKE THESE PAYMENTS AVAILABLE TO I. TEN FILERS BASED ON THEIR TWENTY NINETEEN FILING STATUS I WHICH WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO GO OUT IMMEDIATELY RATHER THAN WAITING FOR TAX FILERS TO FILE THEIR TWENTY TWENTY TAXES AND THEN ISSUE THE PAYMENTS. I'M HAVING TROUBLE OF A MORE TARGETED APPROACH THE STATE COULD PROVIDE A LARGER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR REFUND PER I. TEN ADULT BYLER. WITHIN AND WITH INCOME BELOW THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS- THIS IS JUSTIN HOLLISTER ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE OUT WE THINK THIS. TYPE% OF EXAMPLE WOULD COST SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF. SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. ON BECAUSE THIS AMOUNT IS SMALLER. THAN THE GOVERNOR'S TO FOUR BILL DOLLARS. WE WOULD- SELECTS TO CONSIDER USING. REMAINING FUNDS TO TARGET ONE TIME PAYMENTS FOR OTHER LOW INCOME GROUPS ON. FIRST ON THAT LIST FOR OUR. OFFICE- WOULD BE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS DO FILE TAX USING AN ITEM. ON SIMILAR TO. OR ARE JEWS AND I TEND THESE WORKERS HAVE NOT BEEN ELIGIBLE FEDERAL PFEFFER. ON THE MACINNES TO IT ONE TIME PAYMENTS FOR THE GROUP IS A MORE CHAO. OTHERS WOULD HAVE TO. CONSIDER HOW DOES. MAKE THAT THAT. HAVE THE ADVANTAGE WORKING DRAFT BE ON THE CONTROLLER OFFICE MR. BOB MENSCH. INSECT I LOOK COULD. ONE TIME. TO RECIPIENTS THE JUST SOCIAL SAFETY NET. ON AGAIN SIMILARLY IF THE DESERVE BACK IN FOR THESE WOULD HAVE BE TO TURN LIKELY TO SOMEWHAT. IN THE COMING MONTHS OUR BODIES. PROGRAMS TEND TO SERVE THIS WAS IN PUBLIC MANY OF WHOM MAY HAVE. STRUGGLED THE PAN WITH ACCESS TO COMMUNITY RESOURCES OR RISING- COSTS FOR THINGS LIKE UTILITIES THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. ON RESIDENTS ARE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ON ON. OUR OFFICE RECOGNITION FOR A MORE TARGETED APPROACH OR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- NEXT I'D LIKE TO MOVE ON TO SERRA SERRA KIMBERLIN SENIOR POLICY ANALYST WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER WELCOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I'M GONNA SHARE MY SCREEN SOLUTION. JUST LOOKING FOR THE- IN SHARE. YEAH. YES I'M WORKING YEAH YES THANKS. HELLO GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AGAIN MY NAME IS SARA KIMBERLIN AND I'M A SENIOR POLICY ANALYST WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER I'M I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE I WAS ASKED TO SPEAK ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PROPOSAL INCLUDING OPPORTUNITIES TO STRENGTHEN THE PROPOSAL PARTICULARLY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM OTHER COMMIT NINETEEN RELIEF. AND SO I WANT TO START BY COMMENDING THE OVERALL APPROACH OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. SINCE THE START OF THE KEVIN NINETEEN PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN HISTORIC JOB LOSSES AS ROMA WHERE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN OUT OF WORK AND LAST MONTH WE ACTUALLY SIGNED NEW NET JOB LOSSES. AND YET THE EFFECTS OF THIS RECESSION HAVE BEEN DEEPLY UNEQUAL THOUGH JOB LOSSES HAVE BEEN HEAVILY CONCENTRATED AMONG WORKERS IN LOW WAGE JOBS WHILE HIGH WAGE WORKERS HAVE BEEN MUCH LESS AFFECTED. AND WHILE THE STOCK MARKET HAS BEEN BOOMING. THE BUDGETCENTER HAS ANALYZED THE JOBS HELD BY INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE PROPOSED GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PAYMENTS. M. AND AS SHOWN HERE ON THE SCREEN- WE FOUND THAT MANY BENEFICIARIES ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK IN LOW WAGE JOBS IN INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY HARD HIT BY KOBE JOB LOSSES LIKE LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY AND RETAIL AND MANY OTHERS ARE CODE ESSENTIAL WORKERS IN LOW WAGE JOBS YOU HAVE CONTINUE TO REPORT TO WORK TO KEEP OUR FOOD HEALTH CARE AND OTHER SYSTEMS AND SERVICES OPERATING DURING THE PANDEMIC OFTEN AT RISK TO THEIR HEALTH AND THE HEALTH OF THEIR FAMILIES. AT THE SAME TIME THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY CARRYING THE BURDEN OF THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC. WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY OF THESE CALIFORNIANS WERE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET EVEN BEFORE KOBE NINETEEN HAT. SO THEY ARE THE LEAST LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO WEATHER THE LOSS OF A JOB OR AN UNEXPECTED HEALTHCARE EXPENSES OR ANY OTHER ECONOMIC CRISIS RIGHT NOW. FOR ALL THESE REASONS IF THERE EVER WAS A TIME FOR THE STATE TO GO BANK IN SUPPORTING CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE STRUGGLING THIS IS THAT TIME- IT IS A SMART CHOICE TO TARGET SUPPORT TO CALIFORNIANS WITH LOW INCOMES. YOU HAVE BEEN MOST DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC. AND WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET BASIC NEEDS EVEN BEFORE COPE AND- IT ALSO MAKES SENSE TO BUILD ON EXISTING STATE INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS THE TAX FILING AND PAYMENT INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. AND IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO ALSO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIANS WITH LOW INCOMES IN THIS COURT. THAT COULD INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS DURING THE RECESSION AND NEARLY QUALIFY FOR THE CARRIER TO SEE WHEN THEY FILE THEIR TAXES THIS YEAR. AT THE SAME TIME. WE FEEL THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL COULD PARTICULARLY BE STRENGTHENED BY PROVIDING A GREATER LEVEL OF SUPPORT FOR THE CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM FEDERAL COVET RELIEF. SPECIFICALLY POLICYMAKERS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY BASED THE SUPPORT PROVIDED BY A FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AND THOSE IN MIXED STATUS FAMILIES. THESE CALIFORNIANS ARE DEEPLY INTEGRATED IN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TWO AND THREE HAVE LIVED IN THE U. S. FOR A DECADE OR LONGER. AND MORE THAN ONE IN EIGHT CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS MAY HAVE AN UNDOCUMENTED PARENTS. CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED ARE ALSO A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE STATE'S WORKFORCE BOTH IN SECTORS HIT HARD BY KOBE JOB LOSSES LIKE HOSPITALITY. IN IN JOBS THAT ARE CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL DURING THE PANDEMIC. IN THESE WORKERS ARE CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL WORKERS DURING PREVENT WHETHER OR NOT THEY HOLD A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. THE GOVERNOR'S GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PROPOSAL INCLUDES UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS WHO FILE TAXES WITH AN INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. AND WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE CALLIE IDC WHEN THEY FILE THEIR TAXES THIS YEAR. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STARTING POINT. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM VIRTUALLY ALL FEDERAL CODE REALLY SO FAR. AND SO LEFT OUT OF ACCESS TO THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT HAVE HELPED OTHER CALIFORNIANS GET THROUGH THESE DIFFICULT TIMES. FOR EXAMPLE FOR A FAMILY WITH TWO CHILDREN AND TWO ADULTS. FEDERAL ECONOMIC IN IMPACT PAYMENTS HAVE PROVIDED UP TO FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR MOST CALIFORNIA FAMILIES WITH LOW AND MIDDLE INCOMES. FAMILIES WHERE BOTH PARENTS ARE UNDOCUMENTED HAVE RECEIVED NOTHING. AS A RESULT THESE FAMILIES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO MAKE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICES ABOUT WHICH BASIC NEEDS TO COVER IN WHICH TO PUT OFF DURING THESE CHALLENGING TIMES. EVEN BEFORE THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN ONE IN FOUR CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS AND WORKING FAMILIES WERE LIVING IN POVERTY. MORE THAN DOUBLE THE SHARE OF OTHER CHILDREN AND WORKING FAMILIES. AND THE POVERTY RATE HAS SURELY RISEN EVEN HIGHER OVER THE PAST YEAR CONSIDERING THAT IMMIGRANT CALIFORNIANS WERE FAR MORE LIKELY TO LOSE THEIR JOBS AT THE ONSET OF THE RECESSION. SO CAL HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS INEQUITY. HELPFUL FREE MARKETS TO CONSIDER THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL COVERED RELIEF THE UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS AND EXTENDED FAMILIES HAVE BEEN BLOCKED FROM ACCESSING. AND TO LOOK TO CLOSE THAT GAP. SO AS THE RIGHT ON THE SCREEN SHOWS. I'M THE PROPOSAL THE STATE SENATE'S PAYMENTS WOULD CLOSE ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE GAP FOR THESE FAMILIES JUST 10% FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR TO MORE EFFECTIVELY CLOSE THE GAP IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO PROVIDE LARGER PAYMENTS FOR THESE CALIFORNIANS AND TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR ADULT AND CHILD SIMILAR TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE FEDERAL PAYMENTS FROM WHICH THESE FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS WERE BLOCKED FOR EXAMPLE. SHARE THIS TABLE ON THE SCREEN HERE SHOWS. THAT I AM BY PROVIDING FOR EXAMPLE ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER TAX FILER SPOUSE AND DEPENDENT THAT WOULD COVER ABOUT 80% OF THE FEDERAL CODE RELIEF SUPPORT AND WHICH THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED. LISTING SUPPORT FOR ITIN FILERS THROUGH THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS IN THIS WAY WOULD BUILD ON OTHER ACTIONS CALIFORNIA'S TAKEN TO RECOGNIZE UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS AND MAKE STATUS FAMILIES IS VITAL I YOU'D COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO SHOULD NOT BE LEFT UNABLE TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS. HIS ACTIONS LIKE EXTENDING THE EXCLUSION OF I. TEN VIOLATION THE CALLIE I YOU SEE A YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT. INCLUDING CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS IN MEDIKAL COVERAGE REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. THESE PAST CHOICES BY POLICY MAKERS HAVE MADE AND WILL MAKE AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF OUR UNDOCUMENTED AND MIXED STATUS COMMUNITY MEMBERS. YET THESE CALIFORNIANS STILL REMAIN EXCLUDED FROM ANY OF THE PUBLIC SUPPORTS THE HELP OTHER CALIFORNIANS MEET THEIR MOST BASIC NEEDS BOTH DURING THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND MORE BROADLY. EXCLUDED FROM UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS MEDICARE FOR SENIORS AND MOST WORKING AGE ADULTS. OUT FRESH FOOD ASSISTANCE AND THE FEDERAL EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT FOR EXAMPLE. CALIFORNIA CAN DO MORE TO PROTECT AND INCLUDE THESE FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS. THE LISTING PAYMENTS THROUGH THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS FOR TAX FILERS USE I TENS IS ONE IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT THESE ESSENTIAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS CLOSE THE INEQUITABLE GAP IN SUPPORT FROM WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN BLOCKED AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE THE SUPPORT. THEY NEED TO GET THROUGH THIS CHALLENGING TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WOULD BE TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. VERY GOOD- THANK YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION. HAVE YOU I AM I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE. COME OUT WITH THE REPORT AND I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET IT UNTIL THIS MORNING LIKE SECONDS BEFORE I WALKED INTO THE COMMITTEE HEARING I WILL READ IT- WHAT IS YOUR RECOMMENDATION IN REGARDS TO THE EITC AS THE- AS THE- MECHANISM. FOR DOING THE GRANTS AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN USING TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY. OR A COMBINATION RECOMMENDATION. OUR INTERESTS ARE IS THERE ANY OTHER- METRICS THAT WE CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE WHO THESE FAMILIES ARE. I THINK I'VE YOU GENERALLY IS THAT- THAT THE KELLY IF YOU SEE DOES A GOOD JOB OF IDENTIFYING- WORKERS IN FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA THE WORKERS WITH THE LOWEST INCOMES. AND TARGETED TO HOUSEHOLDS THAT- TAX THAT AREN'T. WORKING- PART YEAR YOU KNOW- IN VERY LOW WAGE JOBS AND THEY SEEM TO BE A LOT OF BENEFITS TO TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE DATA TAX FILING YOU CONSTRUCTION TAX IN AN INFRASTRUCTURE- I THINK THAT- THE QUESTION OF WHETHER TO USE TWENTY NINETEEN OR TWENTY TWENTY- KELLY ATC'S STATUS OR BOTH. AND I THINK THERE'S A BEDSIDE THAT GOOD REASON TO LOOK TO INCLUDING AND- INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE LOST JOBS DURING THE RECESSION AND SO MIGHT FIRST QUALIFY FOR KELLY HD DURING THAT DURING THAT. TWENTY AD DURING. THE CURRENT TAX FILING SEASON. AND IT ARE THE ARE GENERAL THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT. THANK THANK YOU THAT APPRECIATE IT- I BET ACTUALLY THE SAME QUESTION I AM I POSE FIVE POSED TO THE ADMINISTRATION. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. THE NUMBERS FOR THAT. THE FILERS. THE CALIENTE C. FILERS ARE DIFFERENT EACH YEAR THEN THE NUMBER SEEMS TO VACILLATE AND NOT CLEAR TO ME EXACTLY WHY THAT HAPPENS- IT MAY BE THAT THE INCOMES VACILLATE IN THOSE FAMILIES AND THAT'S WHY THEY THEY COME IN AND OUT OF THE PROGRAM BUT- IT IS YOUR PROPOSAL A PREDICATED UPON- USING THAT. BOTH OF THOSE. SIX YEARS OR ONLY ONE I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTOOD. YEAH THANK YOU SO OF SORE PROPOSAL DOES- DOES. HELLO PROPOSAL WE WOULD FOCUS JUST ON THE TWENTY NINETEEN YEAR FOR MOST TAXPAYERS- AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT WE WANT TO GET THE MONEY OUT QUICKLY- AND SO IF YOU WAIT FOR TWENTY TWENTY RETURNS YOU HAVE TO WAIT TILL THE FILED THEN TAKE SOME TIME BEFORE IT GETS SENT OUT- THE ONE EXCEPTION WOULD BE FOR TAXPAYERS WITH. WITH ITUNES- WHO WERE KNOWLEDGEABLE IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND SO WE WOULD BE GETTING- WE'VE BEEN RELYING ON THEIR TWENTY TWENTY TAX RETURNS AS HE INDICATED OF THE ISSUE. THE ON THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. WELL THANK THANK YOU FOR THATTHAT THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE I DO. I THINK MY CONCERN IS THAT WE REALLY PICK UP THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED THE MOST- AND- AND I WANT TO RECOGNIZE AND THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR WORKING SO HARD WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON EXPANDING CAL THE ITC IT IS A INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR WORKING FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS A CREDIT BACK TO HELP THEM ECONOMICALLY AND- THE LONG TERM IMPACT OF RECEIVING THAT KIND OF A BENEFIT IS- IS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE. A TREMENDOUS TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT TO THE FAMILY BUT ALSO THE ULTIMATE- ECONOMIC BENEFIT FOR THE CHILD WHO GROWS UP IN A FAMILY THAT'S RECEIVED CAL THE ITC WHICH I FIND REALLY INTERESTING SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THAT I GUESS THAT THE NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE WHAT KIND OF OUT REACH- DO WE NEED TO DO. AND THE COMMUNITY IN ORDER TO- MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PICKING UP- AS MANY- OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE NOT QUALIFIED FOR FEDERAL PROGRAMS AS POSSIBLE AND I'M WONDERING IF THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A PLAN TO DO OUTREACH AS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL. SO FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL- HERE PARTICULARLY SINCE WE'RE RELYING ON ON TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. RETURNS THERE WOULD BE OBVIOUSLY THOSE TAXPAYERS. MAJORITY THOSE TAXPAYERS HAVE HAVE ALREADY FILED THE RETURNS- WE DO ALLOW- WE DO ALLOW FOR TAXPAYERS. TO FILE THEIR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN RETURNED ALL THE WAY THROUGH- NOVEMBER OF THIS YEAR SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE COULD BE SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDERS- WE WOULD ALLOW THAT AND THERE WILL BE- HI I WILL HAVE TO GET BACK TO THE DETAILS I DO KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE SOME NOT REACH TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE- TAXPAYERS TO FILE. THEIR TWENTY NINETEEN TAX RETURN IF THEY HAVE NOT DONE THAT YET AND MAKE YOUR ELIGIBLE- BUT I'LL OF HIM BACK FROM THE DETAILS OF THE AVERAGE ALL RIGHT THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WAS ALSO- CONCERNED ABOUT THE I. TEN BECAUSE THAT'S A NEW PROGRAM IT'S NEW OPPORTUNITY- AND- BUT IT TAKES FILING. FIFTY EXACT DOING THE PAY. AND FINALLY THE APPLICATION TWENTY TWENTY FOR THE NEW I. TEN MORE- ELIGIBLE FAMILIES AS WELL. AND SO I WOULD ASSUME THAT THERE'S THE SAME EDUCATION ISSUE- THAT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED FOR THAT AS WELL. RIGHT OKAY. THANKS VERY MUCH AS CENTER NIELSEN. IF I AM ABLE MISTER CHAIRMAN WHILE YOU'RE THERE AND I THINK I'D LIKE TO INQUIRE OF MS KIMBERLY PROGRAM AND I SEE SOME MERIT YET BUT I WOULD SUGGEST IT NEED TO BE VIEWED NOT AS AN ENTITLEMENT AN ONGOING OBLIGATION OF THE STATE. BUT AS AN OPPORTUNITY AND A BRIDGE TO GREATER THINGS IN THE FUTURE. DO YOU IN FINANCE- INVASION S. AS JUST A ONE TIME STOPGAP FOR THE DURATION OF A PANDEMIC OR IS THERE A LONG TERM GOAL. HERE FOR THIS PROGRAM. YES TO THE QUESTION SENATORS SO ON SO THIS IS A ONE TIME PROGRAM REALLY GIVEN THAT THE- THE CONDITIONS WERE UNDER THE SORT OF EXTRAORDINARY CONDITIONS THAT WE ARE PARTICULARLY ARE A LOT OF LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND CALIFORNIANS USUALLY CONSIDERED A ONE TIME I HELP TO FAMILIES TO GET THEM THROUGH THE PENDING- THAT'S HELPFUL TO ME NOW- MISS CAMERON HOW DO YOU VIEW THIS- IT DO YOU VIEW THIS IS A ONE TIME THING OR THAT THIS WOULD BE A PATHWAY TO SEE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES. FOR THE UNDOCUMENTED TO HAVE A LONG TERM INCOME IN CALIFORNIA. PARTICIPATING IN THE ECONOMY. AT THE I UNDER. IS THAT THIS IS A ONE PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS THE EXTRAORDINARY NEEDS DURING THE KEVIN NINETEEN PANDEMIC WHICH I THINK WE ENT ON. THE GRILL AT THE ALLEY AS ASSESSMENT THAT THIS IS THAT A GOOD TIME FOR ONE TIME. PAYMENTS TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS PARTICULARLY GIVEN THAT THERE'S A- REVENUES AVAILABLE NOW- AT THE SAME TIME THAT THERE ARE LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND GET THROUGH THIS THIS TIME THOUGH. WHERE YOU KNOW WE ARE VERY. THESE THAT BUT THAT. WIRE GENERAL KILEY IDC- NOW INCLUDES ITIN FILERS ON AN ONGOING BASIS BUT THAT IS THAT SESSION THAT WAS MADE. LAST YEAR AND IS SEPARATE FROM FROM THIS PROPOSAL. I WOULD SUBMIT THAT I THINK BASED ON. POLICIES THAT THE THIS POPULATION IS GOING TO CONSIDER REALLY CONTINUE TO GROW AND CALIFORNIA SO WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF THAT TOWARD THE FUTURE THANK YOU KIND OF CHECK. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU I'D CARE AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SENSE OF HEARING AS A- I THINK THESE- PROPOSALS THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING TODAY ARE REALLY GOOD AND REALLY IMPORTANT AND- I THINK THE- I WANT TO. GIVE KNOWLEDGE MEANT TO THE MINISTRATION WHICH I DIDN'T BEFORE THAT THIS IS WHEN WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE KNOW SO MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AND SO MANY CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES AND SUCH ARE REALLY HURTING. THAT AND WE HAVE. SOME HOT REVENUES DUE TO THE STOCK MARKET WHICH THESE OTHER THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HURTING IN THE BUSINESSES EARNING AREN'T NECESSARILY BENEFITS THEY'RE NOT BENEFITING FROM THE HIGH STOCK MARKET BUT WE HAVE. SO THIS IS EXACTLY THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO IS TO LOOK AT ALL RIGHT WHAT OF THESE ONE TIME ONLY REVENUES. CAN WE MAKE AVAILABLE TO THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN MOST ECONOMICALLY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC SO I REALLY WANT TO APPLAUD. THE ADMINISTRATION FOR BRINGING THESE FORWARD AND- JUST BE CLEAR THAT ARE THAT THE KIND OF QUESTIONS AND THINGS THAT WE ARE RAISING OUR AROUND HOW DO WE- IMPROVE THESE THINGS SO THAT THEY GET TO THOSE WHO REALLY NEED IT. BOTH BUSINESS WISE AND INDIVIDUALS AND THEY ARE SIMPLE EFFICIENT AND S. FRAUD PROOF AS POSSIBLE. SO NOW IF I GO TO THE STIMULUS PART- I WOULD- ASK- WELL I WOULD SAY THAT THE EITC PROPOSAL HAS A LOT OF MERIT IN MY OPINION BECAUSE- IT IS. FOLKS WHO RECEIVE THE H. THEY'VE ALREADY PROVEN THEIR ELIGIBILITY THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN SCREENED IT'S SO IN TERMS OF THAT- GIVING HIGHER CONFIDENCE OF THE FRAUD PROOF IT'S GREAT FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW. HOWEVER AS I THINK IT'S BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED THE TWENTY NINETEEN E. I. T. C. RECIPIENTS MAY NOT ALL BE ISN'T AS MUCH NEED AS SOME OTHER. INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILIES SO HOW IS IT THAT WE DESIGN SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE GIVEN THAT WE KNOW THE FED CHAIR YOU KNOW THIS PROPOSAL WAS DEVELOPED BEFORE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT APPROVED THE DECEMBER THE LAST YEAR'S ACT. SO HOW CAN WE IMPROVE THIS PROPOSAL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ASSISTING THOSE FOLKS THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN HELP YET. AND I LIKE THE- THE FOCUS ON I. TEN FILERS THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT HELPED BUT I THINK THE CHAIR ALREADY ON. BUT BASS THAT WAS SHE DIDN'T QUITE BUT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT PERCENT DO WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT PERCENT. OF ARE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS ARE AYE TEN FIVE FILERS. IS THERE A GIVE US A SENSE OF WHETHER WE ARE ADEQUATELY WHETHER THAT MECHANISM IS ADEQUATELY SUPPORTING- SOME OF THE ROAD FOR FAMILIES OR SOME OF THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA THAT OTHERWISE MIGHT NOT. HAVE RECEIVED FEDERAL SUPPORT SO DO WE ARE DOING NOW. THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE ATTENTION FOR- RENDON YEAH. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HI I DON'T NEED TWENTY I BELIEVE- SO STRONG THE NUMBER OF ITEMS FILERS MUST PROJECT IS ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND- AND I THINK. OF SOMEONE WHO CORRECTLY BUT GOT THROUGH BUT IT MIGHT- THERE I THINK THERE'S ABOUT TWO MILLION. UNDOCUMENTED WHICH WOULD MAKE IT ABOUT. A THIRD OF. LAST NAME YOUR DATE OF. ALL RIGHT. FILE ITEM OKAY- AND WE ALSO KNOW I THINK IT WAS A. O. REPORT THAT- THAT IT NOW I'M GOING A LITTLE BROADER THAT EVERYONE. ALL FAMILIES THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR EITC DIDN'T NECESSARILY APPLY SO WE HAVE THAT I'M WONDERING IS THERE ANOTHER. ON THE THEME OF SIMPLICITY EFFICIENT C. AND TRYING TO ACHIEVE YOU KNOW IT'S FRAUD PROOF AS POSSIBLE IS THERE A NOTHER CATEGORY THAT WE CAN USE AND- I THINK THE CALIFORNIA- ERIN RAISED SOMETHING ABOUT BENEFITS FOR US I WONDER IF CALIFORNIA. IS A- A- PROGRAM THAT CAPTURES SOME MORE OF THESE- INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES THAT WE ARE TRYING TO SUPPORT AND WHETHER. USING THAT MECHANISM. IT N. MAYBE MAYBE IT'S NOT INSTEAD OF BUT MAYBE IT'S IN ADDITION TO AS A WAY TO IF ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE OF HELPING THOSE. FAMILIES WHO MAY NOT HAVE- OR INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. AND AGAIN CALIBRATION THING WERE YOU ALREADY HAD TO BE A SCREEN TO ALREADY HAD TO PROVE I DO YOU HAD TO PROVE ELIGIBILITY- IN MANY CASES FAMILIES FOR EXAMPLE OF UNDOCUMENTED THEIR APPLICATION IS BASED ON THE CHILDREN. BUT BUT GO AHEAD. QUESTIONS YES THE CARE WHETHER YOU ADD TO IT WHETHER YOU REVIEWED. SO YEAH. AND I AM YES SO WE DID LOOK AT THE- I THINK IT WILL POINT WE WERE LOOKING AT CALFRESH AND THE PROBLEM. WITH OUR WITH CALPERS BY RECALL. I APOLOGIZE I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT- ON SPECIFICS BUT- I BELIEVE THE PROBLEM IS IT IS A MINISTRY BY COUNTIES AND THEREFORE WOULD REQUIRE IT BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY- HI. THE V. IN THE COST. IS UPPER WEST PROVISIONS THEY WERE DETERMINES REPUBLICANS WELL I THINK IT'S WORTH IT FOR US TO LOOK AT IT BECAUSE INDEPENDENT OF BEING REGISTERED BY COUNTIES. THEY DID ALREADY DO THE DETERMINATION IF YOU ARE A RECIPIENT OF AN EBT CARD THAT FOR CALFRESH BENEFITS YOU ARE HAVE ALREADY BEEN SCREENED AND ADDITIONALLY. THERE WE KNOW THAT FOR EXAMPLE SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN. VERY HELPFUL TO FAMILIES WHO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AWARE OF CALFRESH SO THAT WHEN YOUR CHILD A PLACE FOR THE FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH THAT OFTENTIMES THEY'RE INFORMED ABOUT CALIBRATION DATE OFFICE SO SOMETIMES THEY MAY BE A FAMILY THAT HAS A CALPERS BENEFIT BUT HOUSE EMPLOYED TO ANY ITC BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AWARE OF IT. OR MAYBE ARE TO I. TEN FILER ADDITIONALLY IT'S A MECHANISM THAT- YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY YES THERE'S THAT FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES HOWEVER IT IS AN EXISTING. PROGRAM IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE HAVE TO START ALL FOR MY FOR A FRESH AND NEW- SO I THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE TO LOOK AT TO SEE IF IT ACHIEVES SOME OF THE OBJECTIVES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE THROUGH THIS. ON THE OTHER THING THAT I WANTED TO RAISE. AND THIS IS A LITTLE BIT SEPARATE FACT- I. IN LOOKING AT THE PROPOSAL'S FIVE ALSO BEEN AWARE THAT IN THE- GOVERNOR'S OVERALL IN THIS IS YOUR OR HEARING THAT WE HAD ON THE OVERALL BUDGET THAT THE. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PROPOSAL BEFORE US CONTINUES- SUPPORT- OR READING LIST AND STATE SOME PROGRAM SUSPENSIONS AND BUT NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT FOR THE FUTURE AND THOSE PROGRAM SUSPENSIONS ARE PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT THE VERY FAMILIES THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS RIGHT NOW. AND SO I REACHED THIS BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE YES IT IS ABSOLUTELY THE CASE THAT WE MUST BE VERY WISE FISCALLY AND WHEAT IS PROJECTED THAT WE WILL FACE SOME KIND OF- REVENUE CHALLENGES SAY IN TWO YEARS FROM NOW. BUT WE SHOULD NOT RIGHT NOW PREDICT WHAT ARE THE APPROPRIATE IF NEEDED CUTS. TO MAKE AT THAT POINT BECAUSE THIS BECAUSE CIRCUMSTANCES JUST LIKE NOW WHO WOULD HAVE PREDICTED TWO YEARS PRIOR THAT WE WOULD BE IN A PANDEMIC. SO GIVEN THAT WE DON'T HAVE WE WILL NOT KNOW WHAT THE SITUATION OF FAMILIES SMALL BUSINESSES AND OTHERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE IN TWO YEARS FROM NOW WE SHOULD NOT ALREADY FIX. WHAT WHAT PROGRAMS WE WOULD BE CUTTING. AND IN THE SAME THEME THAT THESE STIMULUS PROGRAMS THAT ARE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY BOTH FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND FOR- YANKEE C. FILERS AND SUCH. WE SHOULD NOT ALSO BE INCLUDING A CONTINUED CUT OF PROGRAMS THAT WE KNOW SUPPORT MANY OF THE SAME. PARTS OF THE POPULATION SO I JUST RAISE THAT WHILE IT IS NOT SPECIFIC TO THESE PROPOSALS I THINK IN THE BACKDROP OF WHAT WE ARE DOING IT SHOULD VERY MUCH BE FACTORED. VERY GOOD- YOU KNOW I JUST REALIZED THAT- CHESS ALAMO HAS HIS HAND UP I'M NOT SURE IF. YOU WANTED TO RESPOND TO ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. BUT I AM HOPEFULLY THAT IT HASN'T BEEN UP TO FOR A LONG TIME. ONLY A SHORT PERIOD ROLE GETTING USED TO THIS ALL RIGHT- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF. SENATOR SKINNER AND IN RESPONSE YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT THE CALFRESH HOUSEHOLDS OUR OFFICE ON. SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME THINKING ABOUT EXISTING STATE PROGRAMS WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE ALREADY EXISTS WHERE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO TARGET ONE TIME USE OF FUNDS. AREN'T ANY PARTICULAR STATE PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE BUT WHO ALSO HAVE HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS THESE MIXED STATUS HOUSEHOLDS WOULD BE AN ELIGIBLE- ONE EXAMPLE THAT THAT IS TOP OF MIND IT WOULD BE- CAL WORKS HOUSEHOLD AS A CHILD ONLY CASES. WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE. ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A COWARDS BENEFITS- BUT ONE OR MORE THE ADULTS ARE INELIGIBLE TO THE IMMIGRATION STATUS THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A- HOUSEHOLD IN WHICH THE STATE HAS A- DIRECT EXISTING PROGRAM RELATIONSHIP WITH. BUT FOR MANY ADULTS ARE INELIGIBLE CURRENTLY FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS- AND SO THESE ARE SORTS OF OPPORTUNITIES ARE THAT WE HAD IN MIND WHEN SUGGESTING THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER THIS WITH EXISTING SAFETY NET. AS AN OPTION FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS VENDORS CALFRESH FIT IN THAT ALSO OR IT WOULD WERE YOU THINKING. THAT SOLELY AND ONLY CAL WORKS. I WE THOUGHT AS WELL ABOUT HOW NEEDS THE USE ON SIMILARLY- UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE CALFRESH BENEFITS BUT- CITIZEN CHILDREN OR OTHER RECORD HOLDERS IN A HOUSEHOLD RECEIVE RIGHT FITS I'M ONE OF THE REASONS WHY- WE THOUGHT FIRST TO CAL WORKS IS IT GENERALLY SERVES A LOWER INCOME POPULATION AND CALFRESH- SO IT'S A MORE TARGETED APPROACH- WE THOUGHT THAT WAS BETTER ALIGNED WITH SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WE RAISE OUR HAND OUT ABOUT HOW BEST UC SPONSORED VERY TARGETED FASHION OF THE TIME. OKAY I. THAT CLARIFICATION AND I WAS GOING TO USE CAL WORKS ADDITIONAL IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO LONG BUT- ON THE- BACK ON THE CALFRESH. FRONT THE OTHER THING I THINK IT CAPTURES. POTENTIALLY IS THAT- MANY OF THOSE MANY FOLKS WHO EXPERIENCED NEW LEVELS OF. ECONOMIC HARDSHIP IN THIS YEAR WHO MAY HAVE NEVER BEEN IN I. E. I. T. C. FILER IN THE PAST FOR EXAMPLE EARLY. MAY WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A THERE'S BEEN A JUMP IN ENROLLMENT IN CALFRESH SO IT WAS IN MY THINKING WAS PERHAPS WOULD CAPTURE SOME OF THESE FOLKS WHO HAVE THAT. WE WOULD HAVE NEVER PUT IN A CATEGORY OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP SAY LAST YEAR. BUT NOW ARE SO- THERE WAS THE OTHER THOUGHT ABOUT CALFRESH. VERY GOOD WELL THIS SOME INCLUDES OUR OUR- THIS PORTION OF THE HEARING WORD NOW READY TO MOVE ON TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT PORTION OF THE HEARING LET ME JUST SAY IN WRAPPING UP THAT OTHER SECTION AND I REALLY APPRECIATE.
