THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND LET ME SAY THANK YOU TO OUR- HM AND MY COLLEAGUES I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY AS THE CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS AND I'M HONORED TO. RECOGNIZE THE INDIVIDUAL WHO REALLY SHOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGES CRY WHEN THE GREATEST AMERICANS WHO HAVE EVER LET INDIVIDUAL THAT'S UNDISPUTED THAT HAS DONE MORE NOT JUST FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS BUT ALL AMERICANS DURING THE SHORT THIRTY NINE YEARS OF HIS LIFE A LIFE AND LEGACY THAT WAS DEDICATED TO NONVIOLENCE AND THE STRUGGLE FOR RACIAL EQUALITY IN UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. AND FAR FROM THE INSANITY THAT WE SAW LAST WEEK. DR KING MARCHED AND DEMONSTRATED AND PEACEFUL EVENTS ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY IN WHICH- L. FOR MORE HARSHLY. THAN THE TYRANTS THAT RAN INTO OUR CAPITAL LAST WEEK ON THIS DATE IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE DR MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS BORN IN ATLANTA GEORGIA. YOU WERE ALIVE TODAY HE WOULD BE NINETY TWO YEARS OF AGE. MANY DO NOT REALIZE HIS BIRTH NAME WAS NOT MARTIN LUTHER IT WAS MICHAEL. AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL HIS FATHER WENT TO EUROPE. AND VISITED AND SAW. ANTI **** MOVEMENT AND ALL THE OTHER MOVEMENTS OF SOCIETY THAT HE TALKED TO CON THE TEACHINGS OF MARTIN LUTHER AND TOOK ON THAT NAME. AND MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS. TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD BEFORE HE HAD HIS NAME LEGALLY CHANGED TO MARTIN LUTHER KING. IT HAS BEEN FIFTY THREE YEARS SINCE HIS DEATH- HE WAS ASSASSINATED AS WE ALL KNOW. AND SELMA. I MEAN METHODS I'M SORRY IN MEMPHIS TENNESSEE AT THE LORRAINE MOTEL. A MOTEL IN A ROOM THAT I WAS AFFORDED TO VISIT SOME. THIRTY YEARS AGO THIS GREAT MAN'S LIFE CHALLENGE THE SPIRITUAL MORAL COMPASS OF THIS NATION. CREATING A SURGE OF CHANGE RELATED TO FREEDOM JUSTICE EQUALITY FOR ALL HUMANS I HOPE THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN REGARDLESS OF THEIR COLOR. REGARDLESS OF THEIR CREED REGARDLESS OF THEIR RELIGION WOULD BE AFFORDED THE PROMISE OF THIS COUNTRY. IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE. THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON AND HIS GREAT SPEECH I HAVE A GREAT DREAM DR KING CLEARLY STATED. THIS COUNTRY HAS WRITTEN A NEIGHBOR A PROMISSORY NOTE. THAT IT'S COME BACK INSUFFICIENT FUNDS. WERE STEELED DEVOID OF THAT PAYMENT TODAY TO THE NEGRO PEOPLE. SALLY AGAIN WE'RE STILL STRIVING TO THE GOALS OF DR KING. ON MONDAY WE HAVE THE LUXURY OF HAVING A DAY OFF FOR A HOLIDAY NAMED AFTER. A TRANSFORMABLE TRANSFORMATIONAL FIGURE AGAIN DEDICATED TO REFLECTING ON HIS LEGACY SACRIFICES AND HIS LOSS BUT THIS SHOULDN'T BE A DAY OFF BUT IT SHOULD BE A DAY ON A DAY OF SERICE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT DR KING'S LIFE WAS ABOUT SERVICE HE OFTEN STATED THE MOST PERSISTENT AND UGENT QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR OTHERS I ACTUALLY TODAY WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR OTHERS MY COLLEAGUES. TO FIGHT TO ENSURE OUR NATION TO OBSERVE MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR HOLIDAY RESEMBLES THE STRUGGLES FOR KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT AFTER AMERICANS HAVING DORK SINCE ARRIVAL TO THIS COUNTRY. TODAY WE ARE ALL IN THIS COUNTRY. BENEFIT FROM THE WORKS OF THIS GREAT MAN WHO MADE IT HIS LIFE'S GOAL. TO SERVE AND ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THOSE WITHOUT A VOICE. REPRESENTING THOSE HISTORICALLY. MARGINALIZED AND HAVE LACKED ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION. DR KING'S COURAGE AND DETERMINATION REMAINING INSPIRATION AND MOTIVATION FOR MANY LIKE ME WHO GREW UP DURING THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER WITNESSED MY FATHER'S CRIME WAS AT THE SOUTH DIVISION AND ADOPT A MARTIN LUTHER KING. HAS NOW THE ONLY SINGLE. BLACK MEMBER OF THE SENATE I STAND HERE TODAY ON THE SHOULDERS OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING WITHOUT HIS GREAT SACRIFICE. I'M NOT SURE IF I WOULD BE HERE TODAY ARE MANY FOLKS WHO LOOK LIKE ME WOULD BE AN ELECTED POSITIONS OR POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY. HIGH AND I'M HONORED TO REPRESENT NEARLY A MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS GREAT STATE. DR KING LET THE MODERN CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT FOR ALMOST THIRTEEN YEARS. FROM HIS ELECTION AS SPOKESMAN OF THE MONTGOMERY IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION IN DECEMBER OF NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE UNTIL HIS DEATH. A MOVEMENT THAT IS THE CREATOR IS THE BLUEPRINT FOR ALL OF OUR CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENTS WHETHER IT'S WOMEN'S LGBT IMMIGRATION IMMIGRANT BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE NATIVE AMERICANS IT IS THE BLUEPRINT AND THE SHOULDERS ON WHICH ALL CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENTS. STAND ON. THIS MOVE IT AGAIN HAS THE BLUEPRINT. FOR FIFTY YEARS. AND WE'RE PROUD TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD IN THAT. SAME VEIN OF DOCTOR MARTHA KING UNDER DR KING'S LEADERSHIP HE HELPED A MAN AND ABOLISH DISCRIMINATORY PUBLIC POLICIES THROUGHOUT THIS NATION HE ATE IT IN THE REPEAL OF JIM CROW LAWS IN SOUTHERN STATES. HE HELPED SHEPHERD THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT HI. REALLY WE SAY WE'RE DEMOCRACY OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS BUT REALLY WE'RE ONLY FIFTY FIVE YEARS BECAUSE IT WAS NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE WHEN AFRICAN AMERICANS GOT THE RIGHT. TO VOTE. AND BROUGHT TO THIS NATION'S ATTENTION ATTENTION DISCRIMINATORY BANKING AND HOUSING POLICIES AND PRACTICES. KNOWN AS REDLINING SOME STILL. PRACTICE TODAY. DR KING ALSO BECAME ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE NONVIOLENT LEADERS AND WORLD HISTORY STATING NONVIOLENCE IS THE ANSWER TO THE CRUEL POLITICAL AND MORAL QUESTIONS OF OUR TIME HE UNDERSTOOD THAT DOLE'S IN OPPOSITION OF CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WILL RESIST OFTEN VIOLENTLY. AS WE SAW AGAIN LAST WEEK IN WASHINGTON DC NONE THE LESS DR KING RESPONDED AN ACT TO ACTS OF VIOLENCE BY CREATING A DIALOGUE THAT WOULD HEAL RACIAL WOUNDS ENCOURAGE UNDERSTANDING AND UNIFIED. UNIFIED THE MASSES. FINALLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. DR KING WAS A TRUTH TELLER. NO MATTER HOW CONVENIENT OR INCONVENIENT THOSE TROOPS WERE DR KING WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO SPEAK CANDIDLY. HE WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO SPEAK TRUTH TO POWER. IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT N. THE OTHER AMERICA SPEECH DR KING SIX STATED I BELIEVE THAT FREEDOM IS THE BONUS YOUR RECEIPT FOR TELLING THE TRUTH YOU SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE. AND I DO NOT SEE HOW WE WILL EVER SAW THE TURBULENT PROBLEMS OR RACE CONFRONTING OUR NATION UNTIL THERE IS AN HONEST CONFRONTATION. WITH IT. IN A WILLING SEARCH FOR TRUTH AND A WILLINGNESS TO ADMIT THE TRUTH WHEN WE DESERVE IT WHEN WE DISCOVER IT. WE MUST LOOK TO DR KING'S EXAMPLE AS A MORAL AND ETHICAL. TOPICS TO HELP CONFRONT THE PERSISTENT INJUSTICES THAT PLAGUE THIS NATION. THE INSANITY DEALER WE SAW LAST WEEK. DOMESTIC TERRORIST ATTACK ON OUR NATION'S CAPITAL HAS MANY OF US FEELING LIKE OUR DEMOCRACY IS HANGING IN THE BALANCE THE TRUTH IS BLACK AND BROWN FOLKS OF WATCH THIS COUNTRY'S. DEMOCRACY GO INTO A FREE FOR ALL FOR FOUR YEARS. THE TAX AS A RACIST INSURRECTION AIMED TO DISENFRANCHISE ELIGIBLE VOTERS MANY OF THE MILLIONS OF BLACK AND BROWN INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT THIS. NATION THAT STILL BELIEVE THERE'S A PATH FORWARD FOR COMPETENT AND INCLUSIVE DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. DR KING OFTEN STATED. WE WILL REMEMBER NOT THE WORDS OF OUR ENEMIES. BUT THE SILENCE OF OUR FRIENDS. FOR TOO MANY OF OUR FRIENDS TODAY WHAT THE- DIS B. I. YOUR NAME OURS BEHIND YOUR NAME ARE SILENT ON THE ISSUES THAT MATTER MOST THE DAY. AND THAT SILENCE IS CRIMINAL. I BELIEVE DR KING WOULD WANT US TO MAKE A DETERMINATION THAT THE GERMAN EFFORT TO INDOOR ANY AND ALL CHALLENGES. IF IT MEANT CREATING A MORE EQUAL AND JUST SOCIETY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS AS LAWMAKERS AND AS CITIZENS OF THIS NATION. LET US INDIVIDUALLY AND AS MEMBERS OF THIS GREAT SENATE BODY. EMBODIES THEM FOR MENTION DEDICATED INDIVIDUAL SPIRIT AND COMMITMENT TO TRUTH AND JUSTICE. DR KING STATED. WHAT TIME IS ALWAYS RIGHT TO DO THE RIGHT THING LET'S DO THE RIGHT THING TODAY COLLEAGUES NOT JUST BY VOTING FOR THIS RESOLUTION BY TRULY CELEBRATING DR KING BY T. ENDING RACISM HATRED AND BIAS CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS THAT STILL EXISTS TODAY FIFTY THREE. YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. SENATOR HERTZBERG. WHILE ALSO SHAPED BY. COMMENTS WITH THAT OF THE- ARTICULATE SENATOR FROM GARDENA AND ADD TO THEM. THE NOTION THAT THE FRAMERS WHO SOUGHT TO CREATE THIS GREAT GOVERNMENT BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT INFORMED BY AN EFFORT. TO MAKE A MORE PERFECT UNION. THAT OUR EFFORT EVERY DAY HERE IN THIS CHAMBER ON THIS FLOOR. TO ENGAGE IN PUBLIC POLICY IN A MANNER TO MAKE IT A MORE PERFECT UNION. THERE ARE TIMES IN HISTORY WHERE PEOPLE COME ALONG. THAT. HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY VOICE AN EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY TO ARTICULATE. AND EXPRESS THE ESSENCE OF THAT MESSAGE THAT WAS MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR. HE WAS BORN IN A TIME. WHEN THAT STRUGGLE WAS INFORMED BY CIVIL RIGHTS. IN A WAY THAT TORE THIS COUNTRY APART. BUT AS THE SENATOR OF GARDENA MENTIONED IN THIS PRAYER AND I WANT TO REPEAT HERE TODAY BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF DR KING'S MESSAGE WASN'T JUST ABOUT THE COMMUNITY THAT HE WAS STRUCK FIGHTING FOR. BUT FOR THE SOUL OF ALL OF US. WE ARE TIED TOGETHER INTO A SINGLE GARMENT OF DESTINY. JEWS AND BLACKS IN IRISH ITALIANS AND POLES AND LATINOS AND EVERYBODY ELSE IN BETWEEN WE'RE ALL TIED TOGETHER INTO A SINGLE GARMENT OF DESTINY CAUGHT IS CAPABLE NETWORK OF MUTUALITY WE ALL RISE TOGETHER AS WE ACT RESPECTFULLY TOWARD EACH OTHER. AND WHATEVER AFFECTS ONE DIRECTLY AFFECTS ALL INDIRECTLY. THOSE ARE ISSUES OF EQUITY AND JUSTICE AND THE RICH AND THE POOR AND ALL OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WE DEBATE HERE TODAY. AND SO THE QUESTION IS THIS. IT CONCLUDES HIS BRIEF REMARKS IS. WHAT CAN WE DO. AT THIS TIME IN HISTORY. WE CAN LISTEN DEEPLY. WE CAN SHOW RESPECT FOR PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT OPINIONS. WE CAN DO WHAT HE DID IN THE FACE OF BILLY CLUBS AND NOT ENGAGE IN VIOLENCE. ENGAGING THE PURITY OF ALL ALL OF THE ARGUMENTS. OF THE VALUES WE SEEK. IT TOOK FORTY TWO TIMES FOR THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT PASSED UNITED STATES CONGRESS. THESE FIGHT SO LONG AND DIFFICULT. BUT THE NAME OF THE GAME FOR ALL OF US HERE TODAY EVERYONE IS PRIVILEGED TO REPRESENT NEARLY A MILLION PEOPLE AT THIS TIME IN HISTORY. IS TO IS TO BASICALLY EMBODY THAT VALUE. AND TO UNDERSTAND. IN EVERY RESPECT AS WE FIGHT FOR JUSTICE FOR ONE WE FIGHT FOR JUSTICE FOR ALL. BUT WE NEED TO DO WHAT WITH MUTUALITY WITH WITH DEEP LISTENING WITH RESPECT. AND WITH AN ABILITY. THAT WE ARE ALL IN THE POSITION. THAT WE ARE HERE TO. FOLLOW THE CREED OF THE FRAMERS WHICH WAS TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION. AND WE DO THAT WITH OUR CONDUCT EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND I THINK WE HAVE A PERSON WHO IN OUR HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. INFORMED AT A TIME WHEN THEY WERE HIT THEM OVER THE HEAD WITH BILLY CLUBS. THE CONSTITUTION PERSONAL CONSTITUTION TO STAY TRUE TO NONVIOLENCE IS THAT TRUE TO HIS MESSAGE. HAD TO BE INCLUSIVE OF ALL OPPRESSION AGAINST ALL PEOPLE EVEN THOUGH THE WORST DEPRESSION WAS HAPPENING TO HIM AND TO HIS FAMILY AND TO HIS PARISHIONERS. I ASKED FOR SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I RISE TODAY AS VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS. IN SUPPORT OF US SEE OUR SEX- THE JEWISH COMMUNITY. AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAVE LONG HAD A SHARED COMMITMENT TO FIGHT AGAINST OPPRESSIVE OPPRESSION RACISM AND NEVER TO REMAIN SILENT. AS WELL AND WE REMAIN PARTICULARLY PROUD OF THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP- THE JEWISH LEADERS SHARED. WITH DR CHANG AND OF THE ROLE- THAT MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY PLAYED. IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. I WANTED TO SHARE A FEW KEY MOMENTS THAT HIGHLIGHT. THE SACRED BONDS WHICH CONTINUE TO SERVICE OUR MORAL COMPASS. DR KING- CHOSE RABBI- JOACHIM PRINZ THE HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR AND PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN JEWISH CONGRESS. TO SPEAK JUST BEFORE DR KING DELIVERED HIS HISTORIC I HAVE A DREAM SPEECH IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE. RABBI PRINCES ADDRESSES FOR HIS ASSERTION THAT THE MOST URGENT QUOTE THE MOST URGENT THE MOST DISGRACEFUL. THE MOST SHAMEFUL AND THE MOST TRAGIC PROBLEM. IS SILENCE SILENCE OF BOTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE EXPERIENCED THE FOLLOWING YEAR MICHAEL SCHWERNER JAMES CHANEY ANDREW GOODMAN. TO JEWS AND A BLACK MAN WERE LYNCHED WHILE TRYING TO REGISTER BLACK VOTERS DURING THE MISSISSIPPI FREEDOM SUMMER IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR. DR KING SAID QUOTE THOSE MEN WHO HAVE BEEN SILENT WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN SPEAKING PARTICIPATED IN THAT ACT. RABBI ABRAHAM JOSHUA HESCHEL WHO IS PERHAPS OUR MOST REVERED JEWISH CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS MARCH ARM IN ARM WITH DR KING FROM SELMA TO MONTGOMERY. ON MARCH TWENTY FIRST NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE AND FAMOUSLY SAID QUOTE WHEN I MARCH TO SELMA I FELT MY LEGS WERE PRAYING AND QUOTE. RABBI IN DR KING'S FRIENDSHIP RUN DEEP. TEN DAYS BEFORE DR KING'S MURDER. HE DELIVERED THE KEYNOTE ADDRESS AT RABBI HASSLES SIXTIETH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION. CALLING HIM QUOTE A GREAT PROFIT AND ONE WHO REFUSES TO REMAIN SILENT. IN RETURN RABBI HESCHEL SAID QUOTE MARTIN LUTHER KING IS A VOICE OF VISION AND THE WAY I CALL UPON EVERY JEW TO HEARKEN TO HIS VOICE TO SHARE HIS VISION. TO FOLLOW HIS WAY. THE WHOLE FUTURE OF AMERICA WILL DEPEND UPON THE IMPACT AND INFLUENCE OF DOCTOR KING AND QUOTE. HIS WORDS RING TRUE TODAY WE'RE ALL DEEPLY INDEBTED TO THE LIFE LEGACY AND FRIENDSHIP OF DR KING. AND HIS HONOR WE RECOMMIT OURSELVES NOT TO BE SILENT. AND WE STAND WITH OUR BLACK COLLEAGUES AND BLACK SHOES. TO CONTINUE DR KING'S PURSUIT OF JUSTICE. I ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY THAT AS A LEGISLATURE- WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO STAND. AGAIN STRUCTURAL RACISM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE TEAR DOWN. THE STRUCTURAL RACISM THAT CONTINUES TO AFFLICT OUR STATE AND HOUSING AND EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE AND IN A RACIST CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND THAT MEANS ACTION. NOT JUST WORDS AS WE SAY IN JUDAISM MAY HIS MEMORY BE A BLESSING I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AIBO. CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TO SUPPORT S. SIERRA SIX AND CELEBRATE THE LIFE OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR A LITTLE OVER NINETY TWO YEARS AGO DR KING WAS BORN INTO A WORLD THAT WELL DIFFERENT FROM OURS IN MANY WAYS IT'S STILL EXHIBITS SOME SIMILARITIES. THE SECOND OF THREE CHILDREN HE WAS BORN IN ATLANTA GEORGIA TO THE REVEREND MARTIN LUTHER KING C. SENIOR AND ALBERTA KING HE WAS RAISED IN A DISCIPLINED HOME WHO WAS EDUCATED IN BIBLICAL SCRIPTURE THE WORD OF GOD WAS THE FOUNDATION OF HIS LIFE AND THAT PHASE LATER IN LIFE THAT WOULD INSPIRE A MASSIVE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THAT WAS AIMED AT ACHIEVING SOCIAL EQUALITY FOR ALL OF GOD'S. CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF RACE. THE KING LIVE IN AND SEE. AND YOU LIFE. INSPIRE BECAUSE DESPITE THE DISCRIMINATION THAT HE RECEIVED FROM THE WORLD HE WAS BORN INTO HE CHOSE TO FIGHT EQUALITY WITH LOVE. UNIQUE BECAUSE HIS LARGER THAN LIFE FIGURE OF WHO HE WAS IS A STORY THAT MANY PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO. AT THE END OF THE DAY COLLEAGUES WE'RE ALL HUMAN. WE HAVE DIFFERENT POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES RACIAL MAKEUPS SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUSES AND RELIGIOUS IDEAS BUT THEY DON'T DO THEY DON'T DIFFERENTIATE US FROM EACH OTHER THEY MAKE US A VARIATION OF THE SAME THING. A HUMAN. AND ONE OF GOD'S CHILDREN. IN HIS I HAVE A DREAM SPEECH GIVEN ON AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTH NINETEEN SIXTY THREE DR KING KEPT THIS IN MIND AS HE INVITE AS HE ADVISED HIS MOVEMENT. AND I QUOTE. IN THE PROCESS OF GAINING OUR RIGHTFUL PLACE WE MUST NOT BE GUILTY OF WRONGFUL DEEDS. LET US NOT SEEK TO SATISFY OUR THIRST FOR FREEDOM BY DRINKING FROM THE CUP OF BITTERNESS AND HATRED. WE MUST FOREVER CONDUCT OUR STRUGGLE ON THE HIGH PLANE OF DIGNITY AND DISCIPLINE. WE MUST NOT ALLOW OUR CREATIVE PROTEST TO DEGENERATE INTO PHYSICAL VIOLENCE AGAIN AND AGAIN WE MUST RISE TO THE MAJESTIC HEIGHTS OF MEETING PHYSICAL FORCE WITH SOUL FORCE. JUST AS OUR NATION FINDS ITSELF ONCE AGAIN IN A DIFFICULT MOMENT. I PRAY THAT WE TAKE THESE WORDS OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING TO HEART. DR KING IS THE EXAMPLE OF WHAT LOVE CAN DO IN THE FACE OF HATRED. DR KING IS THE EXAMPLE OF WHAT PEACE CAN DO IN THE FACE OF VIOLENCE. AND DR KING IS THE TRUE EXAMPLE OF WHAT TRUTH CAN DO IN THE CASE OF LIES. IT'S WE CELEBRATE MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR DAY MONDAY AND THIS WEEKEND I BELIEVE THE LEGACY THAT DR KING AND WHAT HE STOOD FOR IS MORE IMPORTANT. THAN ANY TIME IN HISTORY IT HAS EVER BEEN. CAN I ASK YOU TO DEDICATE LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM THERE GARDENA SAID. DR KING'S LIFE WAS A LIFE OF SERVICE. SO INSTEAD OF JUST TAKING MONDAY OFF AS A HOLIDAY. FIND SOME WAY TO GIVE BACK TO YOUR COMMUNITY AND SERVE THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT THANK YOU. SENATOR EDMUND I. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT YEAH IT'S A IT'S INTERESTING I HATE THAT I RISE ON THE FIRST TIME TO SPEAK ON THIS FLOOR IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION MARTIN LUTHER KING HAS BEEN ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVORITE HEROES IN MY LIFE AND IN FACT WHEN I TAUGHT A COMMUNITY ORGANIZING CLASS. IN PORTLAND I USE THAT LETTER FROM THE BIRMINGHAM JAIL AS THE FOUNDATION IT'S JUST ALL ABOUT HOW DO WE ORGANIZE HOW DO WE ORGANIZE AGAINST INJUSTICE HOW DO WE DO IT WITH LOVE IN OUR HEARTS AND HOW DO WE DO IT WITH TRUTH. IN OUR WORDS. I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE LGBT CAUCUS ALTHOUGH I'M A MEMBER OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IN THE LATINO CAUCUS THE LGBT CAUCUS. ALL OF THOSE CARCASSES WERE REPRESENTED BY THE WORDS OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING. AND IT'S INTERESTING TO ME THAT HE DIED IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT AND THE L. G. B. T. STOLE ALL RIGHTS BEGAN IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE. THAT HIS DEATH AND IN MANY WAYS WAS WAS A MORE OF A CLARION CALL TO CONTINUE THE WORK THAT HE HAD DONE. COMING IN TODAY I WAS LISTENING TO A- PODCAST ON THE STEPS OF THE THINGS THAT. AND ONE OF THE PEOPLE SPEAKING TALKED ABOUT HOW. IF NOBODY WANTED TO HURT YOU THEN WHAT WE REALLY DOING. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME IS THAT IS THAT IS THAT WE KNOW. THE POWER OF THE WORD OF TRUTH. OF JUSTICE OR THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE HISTORICALLY FOUGHT BACK AGAINST BECAUSE FOR SOME. JUSTICE IS MORE LIKE A PIECE OF PIE OR PIZZA THAT IF SOMEBODY ELSE HAS MORE THAT MEANS YOU HAVE LESS. DR MARTIN LUTHER KING PUSH BACK AGAINST THOSE IDEAS AND KNEW THAT. THE WAY FOR ALL OF US TO RISE AGAIN AND THE WAY FOR ALL OF US. TO BE OUR FULL SELVES AND THEREBY CREATE. OUR MOST PERFECT UNION IS ONE ALL OF OUR VOICES COUNT. WHEN WE DON'T JUST. THINK ABOUT THE CULT OF AN INDIVIDUAL. DR MARTIN LUTHER KING WE STILL SPEAK ABOUT HIM TODAY NOT BECAUSE OF HIS PERSONALITY NOT BECAUSE OF THE CULT OF HIS PERSONALITY BUT BECAUSE OF HIS WORDS AND HIS DEEDS AND HIS LOVE. SO LET US ALL WHEN WE THINK ABOUT DR MARTIN LUTHER KING I'M GOING FORWARD ESPECIALLY IN THESE TIMES RIGHT NOW WHEN SOME OF US FEEL. TARGETS BECAUSE WE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS AND OTHERS FEEL LIKE THEIR TARGETS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE IDEA IS STRONG ENOUGH. THAT WE ALL REMEMBER. THAT WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO IS TO CREATE THAT MORE PERFECT UNION WHERE WE ARE ALL INCLUDED WHAT WE ALL CAN TALK ABOUT IDEAS. IN CIVIL MANNER SUPPORT ALL OF OUR CHILDREN CAN GO TO SCHOOL TOGETHER AND BE SAFE TOGETHER AND LOVE WHOMEVER THEY CARED A LOT OF. SO I RISE TODAY ON THIS DAY AND WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT ROCKY ROAD AHEAD OF US MEMBERS AS WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THAT BUT WE KNOW THAT WE DO IT WITH GOODNESS IN OUR HEARTS WE KNOW THAT WE DO IT AS SERVANTS AND WE KNOW THAT WE'RE DOING IT. AND THE MOUNTAINS THAT WERE CLIMBING RIGHT NOW ARE ONLY THERE BECAUSE THE MOUNTAINS OF HATE HAVE BEEN. FORGED AGAIN AND THE ONLY THING THAT WILL TEAR THEM DOWN IS TO CONTINUE TO MARCH FORWARD ARM IN ARM. MY COLLEAGUE FROM GUARD YOU KNOW MIGHT BE THE ONLY AFRICAN AMERICAN SENATOR HERE BUT HE IS CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY CENTRE WILLING TO WALK SIDE BY SIDE. ARM IN ARM AS WE MAKE THAT RAINBOW COURT COALITION. AS WE FOLLOW THAT ARC TOWARDS JUSTICE I ASK FOR YOUR ITEM. SENATOR DRAWS A. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT DONE FIRST THE POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE I WANT TO SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER SENECA. I REMEMBER THE DAY THAT I SHE WAS BORN I WAS AT OUR LABOR DAY BY LUTHER KING BREAKFAST AND I GOT THE CALL AND I JUMPED IN THE CAR AND TOOK OFF. TO SEE HER BEING BORN WHAT AN HONOR FOR HER. BUT AS CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS IT'S MY PLEASURE TO RISE. IN STRONG SUPPORT OF S. R. SIX. WHICH COMMEMORATES THE LIFE AND THE LEGACY OF REVEREND DR MARTIN LUTHER KING. COLLEAGUES WHEN WORKERS ARE FORCED TO STRIKE. WE SHOULD REMEMBER HOW DR KING RESPONDED TO GARBAGE WORKERS IN MEMPHIS. WHEN WORKERS HE JOINED THEM HE INSPIRED THEM HE MARCHED WITH THEM AND HE WAS ASSASSINATED FOR DOING SO. WHEN WORKERS ARE THREATENED WITH LOSING THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY ARE ORGANIZING WE SHOULD REMEMBER HOW DR KING RESPONDED TO THOSE THREATS. HE WALKED ACROSS THE BRIDGE IN SELMA. HE WAS JAILED IN BIRMINGHAM. AND HIS COURAGE GAVE PEOPLE THE COURAGE TO ORGANIZE THEMSELVES. WHEN WORKERS ARE DENIED HEALTH CARE SIX DAYS OR HAZARD PAY DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE ASK EACH OF YOU TO REMEMBER WHAT DR KING SAID QUOTE. OF ALL THE FORMS OF INEQUALITY. INJUSTICE AND HEALTH IS THE MOST SHOCKING AND INHUMANE. WHEN WORKERS STAND UP FOR FAMILY SUSTAINING WAGES. WE ASK EACH OF YOU TO NEVER FORGET DR KING'S VERY LAST SPEECH. HE SAID DO YOU KNOW THAT MOST OF THE POOR PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY ARE WORKING EVERY DAY. IT IS CRIMINAL TO HAVE PEOPLE WORKING ON A FULL TIME BASIS GETTING PART TIME INCOME. WE HONOR DR KING BEST BUY STANDING UP AND USING THE POWER OF OUR VOTE FOR WORKING FAMILIES THANK YOU. SENATOR PENN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENTS AND SENATORS- I WILL FIRST OF ALL I THANK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM ARGENTINA FOR BRINGING THIS VERY IMPORTANT ABSOLUTION FORD AND PROUD TO STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION IS CHAIR OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. MARTIN LUTHER KING CERTAINLY WAS- A LEADER FOR ALL WHO WON THE FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS- I KNOW MANY API STOOD WITH HIM- IN FACT I BELIEVE IN SELMA OTHER PHOTOS OF HIM WEARING. HAWAIIAN LEIS BECAUSE THEY WERE PRESENTED TO HIM TO STAND IN SOLIDARITY. THEM AND- THANKS TO HIS WORK AND THOSE OF MANY OTHERS AND THE- SO RIGHTS MOVEMENT THE BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT- WE SAW- API CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS EMERGE- FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING AND OTHER BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS. AS WELL SO WE OWE OUR MOVEMENT TO MARTIN LUTHER KING AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY. I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT MARTIN LUTHER KING- WAS A MAN WHO- SPOKE WITH MORAL AUTHORITY HE SPOKE ABOUT FACTS AND DO NOT NEED TO DENY. HIM TALK ABOUT THINGS ON VIOLENTLY. AND T. APPEALED TO THE- GOOD WELL AND THE MORE AUTHORITY THAT HE HOPED THAT EACH ONE OF US HAD HE BELIEVED IN AMERICA AND AMERICANS DESPITE THE FACT THAT HIS OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND THOSE OF HIS FOLLOWERS- DO NOT NCESSARILY. INSPIRE SUCH CONFIDENCE BUT HE ACTUALLY BELIEVED THAT BY SPEAKING OUT AND ACTING NONVIOLENTLY THAT THE OUR BETTER NATURES WOULD EVENTUALLY EMERGE AND AT LEAST A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WOULD STAND WITH HIM. AND WELL UNFORTUNATELY- THOSE WHO OPPOSED HIM- FINALLY TOOK HIS LIFE. HE HIMSELF HIS IDEAS REMAIN IMMORTAL. BECAUSE MMHM BECAUSE HE BELIEVED IN US AND WE NEED TO BELIEVE IN OURSELVES NOW AS WE ARE AS I'M SPEAKING HERE- WE HAVE A CHAIN LINK FENCE SURROUNDING THE CAPITAL WE JUST SAW WHAT WE WHAT WE JUST WITNESSED ACTS OF VIOLENCE IN OUR U. S. CAPITOL IN DC- THERE ARE THOSE WHO UNFORTUNATELY- ARE STILL CALLING FOR VIOLENCE AND I THINK WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT- VIOLENCE IS NOT. THE WAY AND THAT THOSE PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL. WHO NEED TO STAND UP AND SAY THIS IS NOT THE WAY WE DO THINGS AND I THINK MARTIN LUTHER KING IS A MAN WHO IS A EXAMPLE OF THAT AND- HE DID LOSE HIS LIFE- WE NEED TO TAKE WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT- BUT WE ALSO NEED TO CALL ON. ALL TO STAND STRONG. AND SPEAK OUT. AND CONTINUE TO- APPEAL TO THAT MORAL AUTHORITY THAT MARTIN LUTHER KING SAID AS AN EXAMPLE FOR US. SO AGAIN I URGE AND A STRONG SUPPORT FOR IT SEE OUR SIX NO ONE AGAIN THANK MY GOOD FRIEND FOR. THIRTY ENOUGH FOR BRING THIS FOR TODAY THANK YOU. SENATOR. THANK YOU WHEN I MAKE SURE YOU CAN HEAR ME OKAY I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM GUARDIAN AS WELL AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE BLACK LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS FOR THEIR BEAUTIFUL EVENT THIS WEEK THAT I ATTENDED. WHAT AN INCREDIBLE WAY TO CELEBRATE THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF DR KEY ESPECIALLY AFTER A WEEK THAT WE'VE HAD WHAT WE DO NEED TO SEE MORE JUSTICE AND UNITY- I REMEMBER AS A COLLEGE STUDENT READING ONE OF MY MOST FAVORITE BOOKS FROM NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR WHY WE CAN'T WAIT. ABOUT THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF DR KING HE TALKED ABOUT A NEW DAY REVOLUTION FOR EQUITY UNITY AND HEALING EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED NOW IT'S ALMOST AS HISTORY IS REPEATING ITSELF- AND WE HAVE A WAY TO CELEBRATE. TOGETHER WITH HIS. WORDS IN THIS BOOK. SO I USE THAT AS THOMPSON AS A DOC. TO KIND OF RE. ON THE Y. WE NEED TO. I'M AND THINKING- HIS WORDS ON UNITY AND ACT IN HERE. I DO WANT TO READ SOMETHING THAT SHE MEANT- IN THIS IT'S LIKE JUST A QUICK COOK MEN THAT FREEDOM IS MORE WE GET BY THE OPPRESSOR IT MUST BE IT BY THE A- AND AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM STOCKTON SO ELOQUENT YOU KNOW AFTER THE EQUITY- SEEMS LIKE WE'RE TAKING SOMETHING BUT IT'S REALLY JUST TO GET OUR FAIR SHARE AND SO I WANT TO THINK AGAIN MY COLLEAGUE FROM GARDENA AND THANK ALL OF AMAZING WORDS LIKE WHICH. CENTERED THANK YOU MA'AM PRESIDENT GOOD MORNING MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FROM GARDEN WHO ALWAYS SAYS SUCH AN ELOQUENT JOB AND NOT END UP PAYING TRIBUTE TO MARTIN LUTHER KING I THINK THAT THIS YEAR MLK THE HOLIDAY AND HIS THE DAY OF HIS DEATH IT'S EVEN MORE POIGNANT THAN IT EVER HAS BEFORE IT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT AND ALL OF THE PROTESTS THAT WE SAW OVER THE SUMMER AND HOW MUCH WORK WE STILL HAVE TO DO AND THESE PROTESTS WERE NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA. THEY WERE NOT JUST IN THE UNITED STATES THEY WERE ALL OVER THE ENTIRE WORLD AND HERE WE STAND FIFTY THREE YEARS LATER AND WE HAVEN'T HEEDED DR MARTIN LUTHER KING'S WORDS AND I JUST THINK THAT WE HAVE SO MUCH WORK TO DO AND WE STAND HERE AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RIGHTLY SO WHAT AN AMAZING INDIVIDUAL AND MAN HE WAS AND THE EXAMPLE THAT HE SAT. BUT WE NEED TO DO THE SAME IF NOT US THEN WHO AND IF NOT WIN NOW THEN WHEN AND I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH MY FAVORITE MARTIN LUTHER KING QUOTE WHICH I USUALLY REPEAT EVERY YEAR DARKNESS CANNOT DRIVE CANNOT DRIVE OUT DARKNESS ONLY LIGHT CAN DO THAT HATE CANNOT DRIVE OUT HATE ONLY LOVE CAN DO THAT SO LET'S GO FORWARD IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH LOVE IN OUR HEART AND IT'S FINALLY SETTLE THIS RACIAL ISSUE THAT HAS PLAGUED AMERICA FOR SO LONG. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY FURTHER. OR DEBATE. SEEING NONE MADAM PRO TEM. WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WANTED TO RISE ALSO TO SPEAK ON S. C. R. SIX SO I APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION. YOU KNOW I'D PROBABLY BECAUSE THE REMARKS THAT YOU HAVE MADE HERE TODAY REALLY ARE INSPIRATIONAL. AND I THINK ASPIRATIONAL. AFTER A YEAR OF CRISIS THAT'S EXPOSED AND EXACERBATED THE INJUSTICES IN OUR SOCIETY I THINK IT'S FITTING THAT WE JOIN ONCE AGAIN TO HONOR A MAN WHO SPENT HIS ENTIRE SHORT LIFE TRYING TO ACHIEVE JUSTICE THROUGH NONVIOLENT PEACEFUL PROTEST. TODAY WE ARE REMINDED OF A JANUARY FIFTY FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN REVEREND KING MOVED HIS FAMILY INTO A HOUSING PROJECT IN CHICAGO TO HELP HIGHLIGHT THE RACIAL DISPARITIES AND PROMOTE MORE SAFE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AFTER SEVERAL PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATIONS INCLUDING ONE WHERE HE WAS HIT IN THE HEAD WITH A ROCK REVEREND KING WON SOME HOUSING CONCESSIONS FROM THAT CITY. HE CALLED IT THE FIRST STEP IN A JOURNEY OF A THOUSAND MILES. AND FOR MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM IT MAY FEEL LIKE OUR JOURNEYS TO FIGHT FOR BETTER HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL. AND MANY OTHER CRITICAL ISSUES HAVE MORPHED INTO ONE MILLION MILES. IT MAY FEEL LIKE WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING THE SAME FIGHT SINCE OUR COUNTRY'S BIRTH THE SAME FIGHTS MLK FOUGHT BEFORE HIS DEATH. BUT EACH STEP. FORWARD EACH STEP THAT IMPROVES THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS. OF AMERICANS OF ALL PEOPLE NO MATTER HOW MANY STEPS THERE ARE MATTERS. TODAY IN HONOR OF THE GREAT REVERENCE KING'S NINETY SECOND BIRTHDAY I HOPE WE CAN ALL FIND A RENEWED SENSE OF INSPIRATION IN HIS TEACHINGS ESPECIALLY NOW. ESPECIALLY NOW AND MAKE A RENEWED COMMITMENT WITHIN OURSELVES. PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY AND ON BEHALF OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IN CALIFORNIA. TO MOVE CALIFORNIA FORWARD THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. SENATOR BRADFORD WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES- FOR YOUR WORDS OF INSPIRATION- YOUR WORDS OF TRUTH YOUR WORDS OF BELIEF.
