FOR TIRELESSLY TREATING PATIENTS AND HELPING THE- UNDER. THE TRUE RISK- IT IS A IT IS A CHALLENGE IT IS AN EVER. EVOLVING TO WAIT IN AND- WITH. I'M CONFIDENT THEY WE HAVE. THE LEVEL. OPPRESSIVE LEADERSHIP TO. US THROUGH THIS THROUGH THE STORM SO. BUT HEARING FROM OUR- THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY. OKAY NECK WE WILL GET A PRISON. FROM OUR PANEL. AND WE WILL START DOWN THE LINE IF DOCTOR JAMES WHAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE FIRST NO EXCUSE ME I WOULD LIKE PETER FILL IN SADDAM PEELING. IT'S AN YOU'RE GOING TO SPEAK FOR LIKE. PARDON ME. ABOUT FIFTY YEARS AGO MY DAD SAID THIS EXACT CHAIR AS CHAIRMAN OF THE STATE SENATE COMMITTEE. ON HEALTH AND SO IT'S VERY GREAT PLEASURE TO SIT HERE AS WELL SO I'M FROM SACRAMENTO COUNTY I COME FROM BALTIMORE AS WELL. AND IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY WE'VE GONE FROM WAS CALLED THE CONTAINMENT STRATEGY WHICH IS. SORT OF A BLUNT OBJECT OF DOING- CONTACT TRACING AND QUARANTINING OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME TO HAVE CONTACT WITH PATIENTS. TO A MITIGATION STRATEGY WHICH IS MITIGATING OR LESSENING THE REST TO THOSE WHO ARE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FROM THIS ILLNESS. AND WE HAVE NOW- EYES SO NOBLE DOCTOR ANGEL WILL TALK MUCH ABOUT THIS BUT WE HAVE NOW AT LEAST THREE MONTHS WORTH OF EVIDENCE ABOUT- AND THE FINANCES OVERWHELMING AT THE FOLLOWING IS TRUE- A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF CASES ARE EITHER MILD OR A SYMPTOMATIC. KIDS AT LEAST AS OF THE DATE APPEAR TO BE MORE BENIGNLY AFFECTED OTHERS PERCENT. TAX PROBABLY LESS OF THAN BY THE FLU. AND THAT SENIORS UNDENIABLY ARE THE ONES ARE MOST AT RISK AND THOSE WITH CHRONIC UNDERLYING CONDITIONS AND THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF THE MITIGATION STRATEGY. TO DECREASE EXPOSURE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK TO SENIORS AND TO DECREASE EXPOSURE OF SENIORS TO PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE SET. AND GATHERING AREAS IT CETERA. SO WHAT ARE WE RECOMMENDING- IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND THIS IS ALSO RAPIDLY CHANGING AS I YOU GUYS PROBABLY SAW AS YOU'RE WALKING IN THE CDC JUST IMPLEMENTED NEW GUIDELINES- TEN PAGES WORTH OF GUIDELINES. FOR THE MITIGATION STRATEGY. BUT IN MITIGATION STRATEGY WE ARE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK TO STAY HOME. THESE ARE NON THE NON- HIGH RISK PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE SICK TO STAY HOME. PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK AND HAVE SYMPTOMS THAT ARE SOMEWHAT SIGNIFICANT TO CALL THEIR DOCTOR BEFORE THEY GO INTO THE URGENT CARE CENTER OR TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT. THEY CAN'T TREAT THE CASE FROM HOME. PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO HAVE SERIOUS- COMPS SYMPTOMS. OR LIFE THREATENING SYMPTOMS OBVIOUSLY SHOULD GO TO THE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM AND PART OF THE REASON FOR MEDICATION STRATEGIES TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. COMING INTO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND HOSPITALS TO MAINTAIN. OUR SIR PASSAGE IF YOU IF YOU WELL BY LIMITING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE THAT COME IN THERE WITH THE INTERNET IS VERY COME. FOR THIS. ON THE SIDE. WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT DAY AVOID AND THIS IS ALSO IN THE CDC GUIDELINES. THAT THEY AVOID- MASS GATHERINGS- AND INCLUDING PLACES WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE- ACCUMULATE LIKE MALLS. GROCERY STORES IF YOU IF YOU DON'T HAVE KIDS WHO CAN GO TO YOUR GROCERY STORE FOR YOU AT LEAST GO ON OFF HOURS AND GET TWO OR THREE WEEKS AT A TIME. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE. THE MEDICATIONS ON HAND THAT CAN BE MAILED TO YOU VENTURA PET- POTENTIALLY. AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS AND AVOIDING HE EVENTS. WHERE YOU DON'T NEED TO GO TO. SO THAT'S THE MITIGATION STRATEGIES THAT THE FOLLOWING IN THE COUNTY. AND IT'S BEEN A BIT OF A CHANGE OF THE PEOPLES THAT WE GAVE. UP ON CONTAINMENT BUT EXACTLY. AT COLLEGE. THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE DAY. QUE NOW. AND IT MAKES TO AND DECREASE THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE FURTHER I'M PARTICULARLY TO THOSE WHO ARE AT SIGNIFICAN NO SIGNIFICANT RISK OF KIND OF HEALTH CONDITIONS. THANK YOU DOCTOR BILLINGTON THINK OF THE DID YOU WANT IT HAS DO YOU CAN AT CAN INTO IF YOU WERE WANTED UP OUR FELLOWS TIME BUT IF YOU HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR SACRAMENTO SPECIFIC THINGS. OR NOT. I THINK YOU WERE VERY SPECIFIC AND CLEAR ABOUT THAT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME HERE APPRECIATE THAT. OKAY SO NEXT SO WE'LL JUST GO DOWN THE LINE OR WOULD YOU LIKE DR SONI ANGEL WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT WOULD THAT BE GOOD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO ALSO DOCTOR FOR THAT THAT ENTERED BECAUSE I THINK THAT WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT THIS IS THAT IT IS VERY LOCAL IN OUR EXPERIENCE OF IT RIGHT SO COMMUNITIES ARE HAVING DIFFERENT RATES OF THEIR FIRST TRAVEL RELATED CASE OR THEIR FIRST CASE OF COMMITTEE TRANSMISSION AND AS SUCH ARE COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN REACTING AND RESPONDING BUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS MADE UP OF MANY CAL COMMUNITIES AND SO HAVING THIS PICTURE OF ONE AND A VERY DEAR LOCAL ONE AND ALSO WHEN IT IS IT IS EXPERIENCING A FAIR BURDEN. OF DISEASE AT THE TIME AT THIS TIME I THINK IS A REALLY IMPORTANT WAY TO OPEN IT UP TO REALLY GET A SENSE OF WHERE IN FACT PERHAPS OF MOST IF NOT ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES OF MAY GET TO- COULD VERY WELL GET TO- BUT THE WHOLE REASON THAT WE ARE REACTING AND RESPONDING IN THE WAY THAT WE ARE IS THA WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO EITHER DELAY OR PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING- IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES LET ME JUST TAKE A QUICK STEP BACK. IN A AND I AT FIRST THE KNOWLEDGE AND- THIS OP. BECAUSE ONE OF THE- MùT. IN ALLEN OF A NEW VIRUS THAT COMES INTO THE COMMUNITY IS. PEOPLE ARE AFRAID RIGHT THAT'S THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S NEW. AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE AFRAID. AND WHEN IS COMPLEMENTED BY A LOT OF MISINFORMATION WHICH THERE IS WHEN ANYTHING'S NEW PEOPLE CAN MAKE UP STUFF THERE ISN'T AS MUCH SCIENCE TO SAY THAT'S NOT TRUE THAT'S NOT TRUE. IT STARTS TO FEED THAT THE F. FUEL THE FIRE AND- AND SO I THINK AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE HERE ALL OF THE- IS TO SHARE THE FACTS. THAT YOU CAN ALSO SHARE THEM IN YOUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONE THING. WILL HELP US ADDRESS TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY IS WHEN WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER TO LIMIT FEAR. AND REALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT UNCERTAINTY. UNCERTAINTY IS TO BE EXPECTED. AND MY TELEPHONE RINGING IS NOT TO BE EXPECTED I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. BUT THEY'RE VERY CLEAR THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO PROTECT OURSELVES AS WE MOVE FORWARD SO THIS IS A VIRUS APPEARED IN- IN AT THE END OF. THIS VERY LAST YEAR AND- ALMOST A MONTH LATER WE HAD OUR VERY FIRST CASE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THEN JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS MONTH WE HAD OUR FIRST- ARE FOR STAFF SADLY IN OUR STATE. THIS IS A THIS VIRUS AND AT AS DR- BILLIONS IN WAS IT MENTIONED HAS ALSO BROUGHT US ON A PATH WHICH FIRST STARTED IN TERMS OF INTERVENTIONS WITH A VERY STRONG FOCUS ON CONTAINMENT SO YOU RECALL THAT WE- WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME FOCUSING ON PEOPLE. ENTERING THE COUNTRY FROM ABROAD PEOPLE ENTERING SPECIFICALLY TO BEGIN WITH FROM CHINA ALL KINDS OF THE MONITORING THAT WOULD OCCUR IF THEY LET CAME FROM CHINA OVERALL AND IN FACT QUARANTINE IF THEY CAME FROM THE EPICENTER OF WHERE THE- INFECTION FIRST WAS DETECTED. THAT IS A STRATEGY THAT VERY EARLY ON IS OFTEN IMPLEMENTED BUT AT SOME POINT IN PARTICULAR WHEN WE GET TO THE POINT OF COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION. THAT CONTAINMENT FOCUS THAT FOCUS ON INDIVIDUALS REALLY TRYING TO GET AROUND THEM INTO ALL CONTACT TRACING TO PREVENT. ANYBODY ELSE FROM GETTING IT. BECOMES LESS EFFECTIVE. AND WE START TO MOVE TOWARDS IS PERIOD OF MITIGATION. AND IN MITIGATION I THINK IT'S EASIEST TO DESCRIBE IT AS FROM GOING TO FOCUSING ON INDIVIDUALS. TO GOING TO FOCUSING ON COMMUNITIES AND WE ARE MAKING THAT TRANSMITS TRANSITION NOW AND I USE THAT LANGUAGE BECAUSE YOU HEAR THAT A LOT IN THE MEDIA RIGHT NOW. AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT SO CLEAR WHAT IT MEANS TO GO FROM. A CONTAINMENT TO MITIGATION BUT IN ESSENCE WHERE WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING A LOT OF OUR TIME AND RESOURCES NOW IS MAKING SURE THAT THOSE POPULATION WHO ARE. MOST VULNERABLE THE ONES WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO GET INTO. SERIOUS TROUBLE IF THEY ARE IN FACT INFECTED ARE PREVENTED FROM BEING EXPOSED THAT'S OUR FOCUS AT THIS TIME AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE ALL MOVING TOGETHER. SO AS WE MAKE THIS TRANSITION. FROM INDIVIDUAL CASES TO COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION AT APPROPRIATELY OUR APPROACH IS ARE ALSO CHANGING AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HEARING DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES GOING ON ACROSS DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. AT DIFFERENT RATES. SO IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE NOW REACHED A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT SEVEN CASES A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE OF THOSE. ARE NOT REALLY RELATED TO THE REPATRIATION FLIGHT SO THERE IS A SMALL NUMBER. THAT HAS NOT CHANGED ITS AT TWENTY FOUR THAT WAS DUE TO THE REPATRIATION FLIGHTS THAT CAME INTO THE- THE STATE WHERE WE'RE SEEING THE GROWTH NOW. IS IN TRAVEL RELATED AND COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION LARGELY HERE IN THE STATE I WANNA SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR RESPONSE TODAY BECAUSE WHILE MANY PEOPLE MAY HAVE THINK OF OUR RESPONSE HAVING STARTED. YOU KNOW WHEN WE FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT IN FACT OUR RESPONSE HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR OVER A DECADE. WE STARTED PLANNING FOR A PANDEMIC LONG AGO AND THOSE PLANS HAVE CONTINUED TO BE UPDATED AND REVISED OVER TIME FROM OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE BALL OUT FROM OUR EXPERIENCE OF H. ONE AND ONE AND THE SECOND THAT WE HEARD ABOUT THIS AGAIN WE- DUSTED OFF AGAIN DUSTING OFF ISN'T PERHAPS THE RIGHT DIRECTION BECAUSE IT SITS. IN A COMPUTER BUT WE PULLED IT OUT AND STARTED GOING THROUGH IN THINKING VERY QUICKLY AND EVER SINCE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS AS WE GOT NEW INFORMATION UNDERSTANDING THE MODE OF TRANSMISSION THE INCUBATION PERIOD THE DURATION OF INFECTIVITY. UNDERSTANDING WHERE IT'S MOVING AROUND THE WORLD AT WHAT RATE AND AROUND THE COUNTRY WE'VE CONTINUED TO REVISE OUR APPROACH AND WE'VE CONTINUE TO INTRODUCE CHANGING INTERVENTIONS THAT RELATE TO THAT. ACROSS THIS ENTIRE TIME COURSE WE'VE BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE AT RELEASING GUIDANCE GUIDANCE THAT APPLIES TO SPECIFIC POPULATIONS FOR EXAMPLE GUIDANCE FOR SCHOOLS. UGH GUIDE OUR COMMUNITY MEASURES A GUIDANCE FOR WORK PLACES ALL OF THOSE AREAS WHERE PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY IN EVIDENCE TRANSLATES INTO WAY WE ALL OF US BEHAVE EVERY DAY AND COMMUNITIES AND HOME WILL PLAY. IN THE PLACE WHERE WE WORSHIP AND WE PLAY WE ALSO IN. TING PHONE CALLS AND OTHER CA. AND OR ARE COME COME. WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITY ACROSS STATE WITH ARE CARED. PLANNED FOR. AND LEADERS. BECAUSE IN THE END THE THINGS THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. ON THE FRONTLINE OF ISMAKING SURE THAT INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES UNDERSTAND WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM AND CAN USE THEM IN A WAY THAT IS GUIDED BY THE EVIDENCE. AND MAKING SURE THAT OUR CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN PARTICULAR HAS THE RESOURCES THAT IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY. THOSE ARE THE TWO AREAS WHERE WE SPENT MOST OF OUR TIME FOCUSING ON. CONCURRENTLY WITH THAT WE'VE ALSO BEEN GATHERING AT THE STATE LEVEL SO WE ARE ACTIVATED AT LEVEL ONE RESPONSE RIGHT NOW THAT'S THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF RESPONSE THAT CAN EXISTED BUT IN IN RISK. IN RESPONSE TO AN EMERGENCY- WE HAVE DONE A TABLE TOP THAT IS INCLUDED ALL OF OUR SENIOR GOVERNMENT LEADERSHIP. ACROSS EVERY AGENCY THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY NOT ONLY ABOUT HOW IT AFFECTS GOVERNMENT BUT HOW ALL OF OUR RESOURCES IN GOVERNMENT. SHOULD AND CAN BE MOBILIZED TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY AS WE UNDERSTAND. THE WAY THE DISEASE'S MOVING WE'VE INVESTED IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND TESTING IN THE STATE. I IN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH LABS AND I'M DOCTOR WHAT WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT AS WELL. MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE A WHEN THE STING IN VAIL TO GET AVAIL THE IN PARTICULAR IN THOSE CASES. THAT IT CAN AND IS IN CRITICAL TO DIVIDE TO. GUIDE TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. I WANTED AS THOUGH THAT OF THE THINGS THAT NO MATTER WHERE YOU SIT IN WHAT SYSTEM YOU ARE THE WITH THE IF. A CRITICAL THING IS THAT WE BOTH STAY INFORMED AND SO THE CDC. OUR HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND LOCAL AND COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE ALL HAVE WEBSITES WHERE WE PUSH OUT THE MOST RECENT FACTS AND ALSO THE MOST RECENT GUIDANCE AND SO AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL YOUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT INDIVIDUAL. TO GOT TO RECEIVE GUIDANCE FROM- AND YOU'RE AT AS AGREED TO BY YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO GET GUIDANCE FROM ON HOW TO ACT THAT'S MOST APPROPRIATE FOR UNDERSTANDING OF KOBE NINETEEN IN YOUR COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION TO BEING HAVING THAT INFORMATION AND USING THE FACTS TO GUIDE- THE TO SHARE AND TO GUIDE AND UNDERSTANDING AND TO MANAGE- THE FACTOR OF FEAR THAT CERTAINLY CAN ARISE IN THE SITUATION. THE OTHER THING THAT ALL OF US NEED TO DO IS JUST THE TYPICAL THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY DURING FLU SEASON TO PREVENT- THE MOVEMENT OF VIRUSES WHICH INCLUDES COVERING OUR VOWS OF WHEN WE COUGH OR SNEEZE. WASHING OUR HANDS FREQUENTLY AND IMPORTANTLY STAYING HOME IF YOU'RE NOT WELL ALL OF US NO MATTER WHAT. THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO AT THIS TIME BECAUSE EVEN IF IT'S NOT COVERT NINETEEN. IF WE'RE ALL SPREADING ACTIONS THAT WE HAVE WITH PARTICULAR THE RESPIRATORY WE'RE ALSO ADDING TO FEAR IN OUR COMMUNITY SO THAT'S WHY THINGS LIKE GETTING YOUR FLU SHOT ALSO IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ACTION WE STRONGLY STRONGLY RECOMMEND- WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO- GO AHEAD AND PASS IT OVER BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER ANSWERS TO THIS PUZZLE- THAT WILL COME FROM OTHER. EXPERTS ON THE ON THE PANEL. THANK YOU DOCTOR HOPE HILL DR WHAT PLEASE. SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M I JUST LIKE TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON CORONAVIRUS DISEASE SO I'M GONNA BE TALKING A LITTLE BIT MORE FROM A MEDICAL PERSPECTIVE. AND LET ME START BY SAYING THAT WE ARE LEARNING A LOT ABOUT THIS DISEASE I'M THIS IS A NEW DISEASE AND SO REALLY WITH EACH PASSING DAY THERE'S NEW INFORMATION COMING OUT AND WE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE WORKING HARD TO STAY UP ON THIS SO THAT WE CAN INFORM. OTHER KINDS OF RESPONSE EFFORTS THE DOCTOR ANGEL WAS TALKING ABOUT. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS CHANGED ABOUT THIS DISEASE IS JUST THE NAME AND YOU PROBABLY HAVE SEEN LOTS OF DIFFERENT. TERMS USED IN THE NEWSPAPER LET ME LET ME JUST CLARIFY THAT A LITTLE BIT. SO THE DISEASE IS NOW CALLED CORONAVIRUS DISEASE TWENTY NINETEEN. OR CODED NINETEEN THAT'S HOW IT'S ABBREVIATED. AND THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES IT HAS NOW BEEN NAMED. SARS CORONAVIRUS TO. OR SARS KOBE TO- AND THIS NAME WAS ASSIGNED BY AN INTERNATIONAL CAN. IT HAS THE- GIVEN NAMES. AND THEY STILL DID ON THIS NAME BECAUSE THE- GEN. RELAY OF NEW. TO OTHER VIRUSES IS CLOSEST TO THE SARS CORONAVIRUS SO I GUESS THEY DECIDED WILL CALL IT SARS CORONAVIRUS TO. I'M THAT'S A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING THOUGH BECAUSE THIS VIRUS DOES NOT COST SARS IT CAUSES CORONA VIRUS DISEASE TWENTY NINETEEN AND THAT DISEASES DIFFERENT THAN SARS THEY'RE BOTH RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES. BUT THEIR DIFFERENCE LET ME TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CORONA VIRUS DISEASE AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT IT. IT'S PRIMARILY A RESPIRATORY ILLNESS THE MOST COMMON SYMPTOMS ARE FEVER COUGH AND FATIGUE SO IN OTHER WORDS CORONAVIRUS DISEASE TWENTY NINETEEN LOOKS AND FEELS A LOT LIKE THE FLOW. AND MORE ALSO I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE INFECTION WITH SARS CORONAVIRUS TO HAVE NO SYMPTOMS AT ALL AND THOSE WHO DO DEVELOP SYMPTOMS HAVE MILD ILLNESS AND MOST OF THEM CAN BE MANAGED AT HOME DOING THE NORMAL THINGS THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND FOR PEOPLE WITH THE FLU. IN SOME LARGE STUDIES FROM CHINA ABOUT 80% OF RECOGNIZED CASES HAVE EITHER NO SYMPTOMS AT ALL OR MILD SYMPTOMS. NOW ABOUT 20% OF THE RECOGNIZED ILLNESSES- HAVE REQUIRED HOSPITALIZATION IN CHINA WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE WHETHER THERE'LL BE SOME DIFFERENCES HERE IN THE UNITED STATES WERE WATCHING THAT CLOSELY. THIS MAY ACTUALLY BE- AN OVER ESTIMATE BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S GOOD EVIDENCE THAT SOME OF THE LESS SERIOUS INFECTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN RECOGNIZED SO FAR. BUT FROM CHINA ABOUT 20% OF THE- CASES HAVE REQUIRED HOSPITALIZATION MOST OF THESE FOLKS HAVE BEEN IN THE HOSPITAL HAVE RECOVERED AND DONE WELL. ANOTHER REASON SOMEONE WITH COVERT NINETEEN MIGHT NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL IS THEY MIGHT HAVE PNEUMONIA OR SOME DIFFICULTY BREATHING AND NEED SOME MEDICAL SUPPORT ARE ALSO SUPPORT FOR THEIR UNDERLYING CONDITIONS. SO SOMEONE WHO HAS DIABETES FOR EXAMPLE WHO GETS INFECTED WITH COVERT NINETEEN MIGHT NEED EXTRA HELP IN MANAGING THEIR DIABETES. ABOUT 5% OF RECOGNIZED CASES IN CHINA HAVE REQUIRED ADMISSION TO AN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. IN ABOUT REITERATE THAT THESE DATA COME FROM CHINA AND MOST OF THE CHINESE DATA ARE COMING FROM THE EPICENTER OF WHERE THIS VIRUS EMERGED IN WHO BAY PROVINCE. OUTSIDE OF THAT PROVINCE. IN CHINA THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD A CASE OF THIS DISEASE AND- HAVE GONE ON TO DIE IS MUCH LOWER ABOUT HALF OF A PERCENT. SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES PARTICULARLY AS WE LEARN ABOUT TREATING COVERT NINETEEN. THE DEATH RATE MAY EVEN BE LOWER. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE RISK OF SEVERE DISEASE AND DEATH IS DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS. SO AS DR BEYONCE AND POINTED OUT THIS DISEASE- HIS NAME. IS MUCH TENDS TO BE MUCH MILDER IN CHILDREN AND THE RISK OF SEVERE DISEASE DOES INCREASE WITH AGE AND IT ALSO INCREASES FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITIONS. AND SOME OF THE REPORTS FROM CHINA HAVE INDICATED THAT THE RISK OF SEVERE DISEASE. GOES UP AS PEOPLE GET INTO THEIR SIXTIES SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES AND INCREASES AS PEOPLE GET OLDER. SO AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT. PICTURE OF THIS IS GOING TO BE PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF THE PROPORTION OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEVERE DISEASE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES- AS DOCTOR ANGEL POINTED OUT- PROTECTION OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE OLDER PEOPLE WHO HAVE UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITIONS HAS BEEN A PRIMARY FOCUS OF OUR RESPONSE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE. AS WE MOVE INTO THIS MITIGATION FACE. LET ME SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT TREATMENT TO RIGHT NOW TREATMENT IS PRIMARILY SUPPORTIVE THAT MEANS MANAGEMENT OF SYMPTOMS AND SUPPORTING GENERAL HEALTH. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC TREATMENTS FOR- COVERT NINETEEN BUT LET ME SAY MORE ALSO MORE ABOUT THAT IN A MINUTE. PEOPLE WITH MILD ILLNESS CAN STAY HOME AND FOLLOW THE USUAL ADVICE FOR THE FLU. REST GET PLENTY OF FLUIDS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY STAYING AWAY FROM OTHERS WHILE THEY'RE SEC. IF SOMEONE DOES NEED TO BE HOSPITALIZED THEY MAY BE TREATED WITH XYGEN AND FLUIDS AND GIVING CARE FOR THEIR UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITIONS IF THEY HAVE ANY. IN AN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. MORE INTENSIVE BREEDING SUPPORT CAN BE PROVIDED. NOW BACK TO MEDICATIONS THERE ARE SOME MEDICATIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING TESTED TO SEE IF THEY ARE EFFECTIVE AGAINST COVERT NINETEEN THESE MEDICATIONS ARE AVAILABLE NOW AND ARE BEING USED FOR SEVERELY ILL PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES AND AS MORE PEOPLE GET TREATED WE WILL LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVE THESE MEDICATIONS ARE. AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO WE MAY HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS FOR COVERT NINETEEN THAT WOULD BE PARTICULARLY VALUABLE FOR PEOPLE WITH MORE SEVERE DISEASE. IN CLOSING I JUST WANT TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON VACCINES BECAUSE THAT'S A COMMON QUESTION WORK HAS STARTED ON A COVERT NINETEEN VACCINE. BUT VACCINE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN TESTING MEDICATION SO THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF MONTHS AS I INDICATED IT WOULD BE FOR MEDICATIONS. USUALLY VACCINE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING TAKES YEARS WITH THE INTENSE EFFORT THAT'S BEING FOCUSED ON COVERT NINETEEN INCLUDING VACCINE DEVELOPMENT. THE TIMELINE MIGHT BE SHORTENED BUT IT'S LIKELY THAT IT WILL BE AT LEAST A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE WE SEE A FULLY READY TO GO- VACCINE FOR THIS CONDITION. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR WHAT AND NOW WILL HAVE CARE A DOCTOR BUT BYINGTON SPEAK BUT WE LOST YOUR- A LITTLE. SHE IS EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF YOU SEE HEALTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD FOR OF HAVING THIS SESSION AND THANK YOU TO ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES. I AGREE WITH EVERY STATEMENT THAT'S BEEN MADE- SO FAR- TODAY. AND AS EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT FOR. YOU SEE HEALTH. OF I WANTED TO THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WANTED TO TELL YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY BACKGROUND. MY TITLE MAY NOT NECESSARILY CONVEY AN AREA OF EXPERTISE. I% AM A PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE PHYSICIAN TRAINED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. MY PARTICULAR AREA OF RESEARCH HAS BEEN RESPIRATORY VIRAL INFECTIONS IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN I PRACTICE MY ENTIRE CAREER IN A CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. AND I HAVE WORKED ON OF EMERGING PATHOGENS AND OTHER INFECTIONS THAT LEAD TO PANDEMICS. I HAVE WORKED WITH THE H. ONE N. ONE INFLUENZA PANDEMIC WITH EBOLA AND DURING THE SEEK OUT BREAK I WAS THE LEAD POSITION FOR THE US OLYMPIC COMMITTEE- IN CHARGE OF. OF THE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL OLYMPIANS AND PARALYMPIANS RELATED TO SEEK OUT. AND I'M GLAD TO SAY THAT NOT ONE OF OUR- U. S. CONTINGENT A CONTRACTED SECA DURING OUR TIME IN BRAZIL. SO I'M VERY PROUD AND PRIVILEGED TO LEAD THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH SYSTEM AT THIS TIME AND FEEL THAT MY- PAST HISTORY CAN BRING US SOME EXPERTISE TO THE SITUATION IN WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. IS IN REMARKABLE HEALTH SYSTEM RENOWNED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES WITH FIVE FLAGSHIP MEDICAL CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR HOSPITALS ARE MONTHS THE HIGHEST RATED IN THE UNITED STATES ND IN THE WORLD. OUR PHYSICIANS AND OUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND SCIENTISTS ARE PREPARED TO ADDRESS THE THREAT OF COVERT NINETEEN AND THE PANDEMIC JUST AS DOCTOR ANGEL SAID WE DID NOT START TO PREPARE FOR THIS IN DECEMBER WE BEEN PREPARING FOR THIS FOR OVER A DECADE. SO ALTHOUGH I'VE RETURNED TO CALIFORNIA RELATIVELY RECENTLY IN OCTOBER LIKE DOCTOR ANGEL UP I HAVE BEEN SO PLEASED TO SEE THE COLLABORATIONS THAT EXIST AT UC HEALTH WITH OUR LOCAL AND STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. AND WE ARE WORKING VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH THESE RESOURCES AM WITH THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL TO ADDRESS THE THREAT OF COKE NINETEEN. BECAUSE I'M COMING FROM THE UC HEALTH SYSTEM I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION OF WHAT YOU SEE HEALTH IS DOING TO ADDRESS. COVERT NINETEEN AND IT'S REALLY IN THREE AREAS FIRST THE DELIVERY OF PATIENT CARE. SECOND PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THIRD CONTRIBUTING TO RESEARCH THESE ARE VERY SPECIFIC AREAS WHERE AN ACADEMIC HEALTH SYSTEM CAN BE A OF GREAT SUPPORT. SO FIRST IN PATIENT CARE. AS EVERYONE HAS SAID THIS IS CHANGING EACH DAY AND REALLY HOUR BY HOUR. YOU SEE HEALTH ACROSS OUR SYSTEM HAS NOW TAKING CARE OF ELEVEN PATIENTS WITH COVERT NINETEEN DISEASE. AN ABOUT EIGHTY INDIVIDUALS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR COVERT NINETEEN DISEASE. ALL OF OUR HEALTH CENTERS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THESE- EVALUATIONS AND PROVIDING CARE. THESE WERE THE FIRST PATIENTS CARED FOR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND REPRESENTED DOES THAT I HAD TRAVEL ASSOCIATED COVERED NINETEEN AND THOSE THAT HAD COMMUNITY ACQUIRED COATED NINETEEN. AND WITH EACH PATIENT WE HAVE HAD CLOSE CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE LOCAL PATIENT LIFT WITH THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE WITH THE STATE AND WITH THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE HAS INFORMED THE GUIDANCE AT BOTH THE STATE AND THE NATIONAL LEVEL FOR THE CARE OF THESE PATIENTS. SECOND IS PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES. YOU SEE IS A LARGE ACADEMIC INSTITUTION ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AT A AND WE'VE ACROSS THE STATE AND WE FEEL THAT YOU SEE HEALTH A SPECIAL ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS WHICH NUMBER ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND AND TO PROTECT OUR EMPLOYEES WHICH NUMBERS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. AND SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS YOU SO USE THE HEALTH TO INTERPRET THE GUIDANCE THAT'S COMING FROM OUR LOCAL. AND STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND THE CDC AND TO ADAPT THAT GUIDANCE TO MAKE OUR WORK ENVIRONMENTS AND OUR EDUCATION ENVIRONMENT AS AS POSSIBLE. THE OTHER PLACE WHERE WE REALLY WORKING PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY IS WITH DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. ALL OF YOU WHO READ THE NEWSPAPERS AND LISTEN TO THE NEWS REPORTS NO THAT DIAGNOSTIC TESTING HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE. OUR MEDICAL CENTER LABORATORIES ARE ALL WORKING TO CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASING TEST AVAILABILITY ALL FIVE OF OUR MEDICAL CENTER LABORATORIES HAVE DESIGNED TEST FOR COVERT NINETEEN AND ALL OF THEM ARE WORKING THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS. ALLOCATION PROCESS TO OFFER THAT TESTING. WAS THE STATE. AS OF YESTERDAY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO ARE OFFERING IN HOUSE COATED NINETEEN TEST. THE TURNAROUND TIMES THAT WILL BE UNDER TWENTY FOUR HOURS SO WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THIS WILL REALLY- EIGHT AT THE STATE IN GETTING MORE PEOPLE TESTED. AND I KNOW THAT MY NEXT TWO LABS UC IRVINE AND UC DAVIS THEIR TEST WILL COME ON LINE VERY QUICKLY AS WELL. AND THEN FINALLY CONTRIBUTING TO RESEARCH. IN A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THERE ARE MANY PRIORITIES. FOR US IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM PATIENT CARE IS PRIORITY NUMBER ONE. THE WONDERFUL THING ABOUT BEING IN AN ACADEMIC HEALTH CENTER IS WE ALSO HAVE A RANGE OF SCIENTISTS WHO WERE THERE TO HELP US TO HELP THOSE THAT ARE DELIVERING HEALTHCARE BY ACTUALLY CONDUCTING RESEARCH AND ALL OF OUR SCIENTISTS WITH WITH GATHERED THEM IN MANY GROUPS TO TACKLE INDIVIDUAL ISSUES ACROSS- ACROSS THIS WHOLE. PANDEMIC WE ARE WORKING ON ADDRESSING IMMEDIATE CONCERNS IN THE UNITED STATES FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IS THE ROLE OF CHILDREN. SHOULD SCHOOLS BE CLOSED OUR CHILDREN INVOLVED IN THE TRANSMISSION OF DISEASE IF WE STOP DISEASE IN CHILDREN WILL THAT PROTECT OTHERS THESE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. AND THEN IN THE HEALTHCARE SETTING HOW LONG IS A PATIENT INFECTIOUS WHAT TYPE OF PROTECTION DO WE NEED OF WINDOWS THEIR INFECTIVITY GO DOWN AND ALLOW THEM TO BE CARED FOR AT HOME AND NOT INFECT OTHERS IN THEIR HOMES. WE KNOW HOME. POURTANT PLACES OF TRANSMISSION. AND THEN WE'RE ALSO ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE LONG TERM RESEARCH PROJECTS WHICH INCLUDE LOOKING AT THE GENOMICS OF THE VIRUS UNDERSTAND. WHERE WE MIGHT BEST TACKLE THIS VIRUS WITH NEW TREATMENTS AND VACCINES. AND THEN FINALLYIS IN THE CLINICAL TRIALS OF THE TREATMENTS AND VACCINES THAT WILL BE PROPOSED. ALL FIVE OF OUR MEDICAL CENTERS AND- HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS TO BE SELECTED AS CLINICAL TRIAL SITES FOR RENDA. THE ANTI PRETTY BY AT WHICH IS BEING TESTED IN THE UNITED STATES SO WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO OFFER CLINICAL TRIALS FOR THE TREATMENT AT ALL OF OUR MEN. SO ONCE AGAIN I'M VERY TO BE WORKING IN CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM WHICH IS OF WORLDWIDE SIGNIFICANCE AND VERY VERY CONFIDENT TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE STATE AND COUNTY AND SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DOCTOR BY INTENT OKAY JUST BEFORE WE START THE QUESTION AND ANSWER. SESSION I HAVE SOME THINGS THAT RULES THE RULES COMMITTEES WOULD LIKE ME TO STATE BEFORE WE START. THERE'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS COMING FROM THE STAFF OF THE LEGISLATURE CONCERNING OUT ASSEMBLY AND SENATE ARE RESPONDING TO THE COVERT NINETEEN OUT BREAK. THE RULES COMMITTEES OF BOTH HOUSES ARE IN DAILY COMMUNICATION WITH STAFF AND MAY HAVE MEMBERS AND A PROVIDING MET HIM FROM BASED THE REGULAR CALLED. WITH HEALTH THANK. AS THE SITUATION INVOLVES THEY ARE PREPARED TO RESPOND AND WE'LL COMMUNICATE ACCORDINGLY. IF STAFF HAVE PERSONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS THEY SHOULD CONTACT HUMAN. HUMAN HUMAN RESOURCES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HOUSES. GOOD SO WITH THAT WE ARE GOING TO START THE AND ANSWER SESSION WILL JUST OPEN UP THE WHOLE PANEL OF THE AUDIENCE MAY ASK QUESTIONS BY RAISING A HAND IN THE HOUSE WILL COME TO YOU. PLEASE THAT THE HOST WILL HOLD THE MICROPHONE FOR YOU. BUT AND YOU WILL WHEN YOU ASK YOUR QUESTION. AND WE HAVE. WE ALSO WILL TAKE QUESTIONS THE DISTRICT OFFICES AND I HAVE SEVERAL EMAILS HERE THAT WE CAN GO OVER SERVE WE'D LIKE WE CAN GO AHEAD AND START. GREAT THANK YOU I'M RICHARD THOMAS AND WITH BLUE SHIELD OF CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION- DOCTOR ANGEL A QUESTION FOR YOU JUST- VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR- COMMENTS ABOUT THE LOCAL NATURE OF THE- DISEASE AS IT'S- SPREADING AROUND CALIFORNIA. WHEN IF YOU COULD TALK SOME MORE ABOUT. HOW YOUR DEPARTMENT IS GETTING INFORMATION OUT TO COMMUNITIES IN. ALL THE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES THAT THAT INFORMATION NEEDS TO GET OUT IN. AS A WAY OF ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND MISINFORMATION THAT'S OUT THERE THANK YOU. MICROPHONE AREA. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I MAY THINK THAT'S IT RIGHT A CRITICAL- ISSUE AND- INCREDIBLY RELEVANT HERE IN CALIFORNIA- WE HAVE THE HONOR OF HAVING A GREAT DIVERSITY OF POPULATIONS A LARGE IMMIGRANT POPULATION. AND SO- BEING ABLE TO SHARE INFORMATION AND- LANGUAGE IS SPECIFIC TO THE ORIGINS OF OUR COMMUNITIES IS CRITICAL SO WE AT- THROUGH OUR WEBSITE HAVE THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. WE ALSO RELY HEAVILY ON THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES WHERE- THE RESOURCES ARE SPECIFIC TO THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY AND THROUGH- PARTNERS THAT WE HAVE ACROSS THE STATE- THAT WORK WITH SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO. SHARE THAT INFORMATION AND HELP DISSEMINATED THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA WE'VE ALSO BEEN- RECORDING- PSA TYPE VIDEOS PUSHING THEM OUT ANOTHER LANGUAGES AS WELL WITH- DIFFERENT CAPTIONING AS WELL- THIS IS QUICKLY MOVING. SO WE HAVE. HE CAREFULLY A WHICH POPULAR WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE PRIOR. GET OUT EARLY AND AS IT OF ALL WILL CAN TO PUSH. GOOD AFTERNOON I WORK WITH THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE. BUT I THINK THIS QUESTION OF YOUR ELEMENT FOR OTHERS AND IT'S PROBABLY AN UNFAIR QUESTION BUT WERE WONDERING GIVEN YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES HOW LONG YOU THINK WILL BE IN THIS MITIGATION PHASE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE ARE MILESTONES IN THE WORK THAT WE DO LIKE STANDARDIZED TESTING IS COMING UP- WE NEED TO MAKE POLICY CHANGES. RELATED TO SORT OF THE DURATION OF WHAT WE EXPECT THIS OUTBREAK TO BE IT'S AN UNFAIR QUESTION I REALIZED BUT IS THERE A BASS GAS OF HOW LONG WILL BE IN THIS MEDICAID. STAGE. IT'S A QUESTION AND I THINK I APPRECIATE YOUR CARRY OUT THAT IT. IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW- I THINK PROBABLY THE BEST- SORT OF TOUCHED ON THAT WE HAVE IS WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE H. ONE AND ONE- PANDEMIC- AND THAT REALLY LASTED FOR. MANY MONTHS AND THEN KIND OF CARRIED OVER INTO THE FOLLOWING FLU SEASON SO- I CAN GIVE YOU A PRECISE ANSWER BUT I DO THINK THAT. ARE PART. OF PARTNERS OUT THERE WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT THEIR PLANNING AND WOOD AND DEFINITELY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BE THINKING IN ASKING THIS VERY QUESTION SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT. MONTHS ALSO ADDED ON. PART OF THIS. AS ENTER GOING FROM CONTAINMENT TO SORT OF A MIX CONTAINMENT MITIGATION APPROACH. IS NOT BECAUSE WE THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO PREVENT EVERY ANY FURTHER SPREAD WERE REALLY JUST TRYING TO SLOW IT DOWN- WE WANT TO SLOW DOWN LONG ENOUGH FOR US TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE TREATMENTS ONLINE AND VACCINATIONS ONLINE. AND WHEN WE GET THOSE TWO VERY IMPORTANT TOOLS THEN WE SORT OF MOVE MORE INTO MANAGING THIS LIKE WE WITH THE FLU ANNUALLY WHICH MEANS. WE CAN CARDS EVERYONE TO GET THEIR FLU SHOT AND THROUGH THAT WERE ABLE TO REALLY HAVE A BETTER- SENSE OF MANAGEMENT OF THIS- MANY OF THE MITIGATION ALSO ACTIVITIES THAT WE TALK ABOUT. ARE THINGS THAT JUST MAKES SENSE ANYWAY WITH RESPECT TO- TO VIRUSES SO IT THAT WHILE WE TALK ABOUT IS IT'S- AS IF IT'S SOMETHING TOTALLY NEW IT'S THE- END THERE ARE DEFINITELY MEASURES THAT WERE INTRODUCED IN THAT. WE HAVEN'T MESSED EARLY INTRODUCED UP PRIOR MANY OF THEM LIKE SOCIAL DISTANCING WHEN YOU'RE ILL AND STAYING HOME ARE THINGS THAT ARE GOOD PRACTICE FOR US ANYWAY SO I THINK WILL BENEFIT FROM LESSONS LEARNED. FOR MUCH LONGER TIME PERIOD THAN JUST AS LONG AS THIS CORONA VIRUSES IS BOTHERING US. THANK YOU HI MY NAME IS WITH THE WRITERS AND ONLY WITH A SOMEONE REYES OFF I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE TEST- TESTING DIAGNOSTIC AND THAT IS BEING DONE IN THE UC HOSPITALS- ARE THEY- I CAN OTHER FOR NON UC FACILITIES ALSO USE THAT KIND OF TEST AND- FOR THOSE THAT. AREN'T USING THOSE IN HOUSE TESTS THINGS WE SO WE STILL WAITING ON THEM THE SENATE OVER TO SEND SAMPLES OVER TO THE CDC IN. ATLANTA LIKE WHAT WHAT IS HAS SOME LOOK LIKE RIGHT NOW. SO TESTING RIGHT NOW- INVOLVES A LOT OF COORDINATION SO. NOW WE ARE ABLE TO SEND TEST TO THE- LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND- A LAB WHICH MEANS THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY TO ATLANTA SO THAT'S VERY HELPFUL AND USEFUL. AND IS BROUGHT DOWN THE TURN AROUND TIME. FOR YOU SEE SPECIFICALLY- OF OUR TESTS ARE BEING OFFERED. TO THE PATIENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE UC SYSTEM IN OUR CLINICS IN IN OUR HOSPITALS. THE WE HAVE GOTTEN A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS OF FROM. A AT BY PROVIDERS OF HOW THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO ACCESS. THOSE TESTS AND I HAVE A GROUP THAT'S CURRENTLY WORKING TODAY OUR CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER'S. TRYING TO- IDENTIFY WHETHER WE WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPACITY OR ABILITY TO OFFER TESTING FOR OTHERS. I ALSO KNOW THAT OTHER. HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ARE DEVELOPING THEIR OWN TEST AS WELL. AND THEN FINALLY THERE ARE THINGS CALLED COMMERCIAL TESTS SO DEVELOPED BY COMPANIES. AND OUR LABORATORY DEVELOPED TESTS WILL HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CAPACITY. BUT ONCE COMMERCIAL TESTS ARE APPROVED FOR USE IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH WERE EXPECTING BY. OF APRIL. THAT INCREASES OUR- DRAMATICALLY AND SO HOPEFULLY THERE BE MANY MANY MORE WAYS AND IN WHICH- FOR TEN. IN THE NEXT WEEK. WHOLE NICOLE JUST FORGET I WANNA FOLLOW UP WITH ACTOR WE HAVE YOU FROM MY DISTRICT ALL. THAT FIT WITH THE TESTING HERE A WOMAN LOAN FROM THE WHAT SOMEBODY NO AND NO ABILITY TO PAY. TO TEST. AND ASKED CAPACITY. YOU KIND OF TO THIS ALREADY DONE BY INTO BUT WILL THE TESTING GET MORE REAL. CAN SOMEONE EVEN WITH MY SIM THAT SO POINT. BE ABLE TO BE TO IF TESTING INCREASE OF TEN BECOMES IN. LIKE TRY PER OF THOSE BUT YOU ALL MAY BE TO SAY HOW THE TESTING AT THE STATE LAW WE BEEN VERY PLEASED SEE. THROUGH CALIFORNIA RELEASE OF SOME OF THE WRIST FOR COPAYS AND SO MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN GET TESTED WE'RE DOING THE SAME WITH AND USE FOR OUR- FOR OUR SELF INSURED- OF. EMPLOYEES AND FOR OUR STUDENTS WHO WERE ENDS IN YOUR BY THE HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM. AND THEN AS FAR AS GETS TO HAVE A TEST. IT'S ALL RIGHT BE OF THAT SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE GUIDANCE ALLOWING CLINICAL JUDGMENT UP SO ALLOWING THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER O HELP DECIDE IF THE TEST IS REQUIRED- AND SO THAT ALREADY IS EXISTING. BUT WE'RE WE'RE SAYING THAT THEY'RE STILL- PERHAPS NOT QUITE ENOUGH TEST. TO ALLOW ALL. AT WHO WANTS A RIGHT NOW TO HAVE A TO. BUT IN MAYBE FOR THE STATE LAPSED VIA. I'M JUST TO ADD TO THAT AND I WOULD DEFINITELY WITH THOSE COMMENTS- THE GUIDANCE FOR WHO SHOULD BE TESTED HAS DEFINITELY BEEN EVOLVING OVER TIME BUT JUST IN THE LAST FEW DAYS THE CDC HAS- CHANGE THE GUIDANCE AS AS DOCTOR BYINGTON INDICATED SO THAT IT'S REALLY NOW UP TO THE PHYSICIAN TO DECIDE. JUST AS IT WOULD BE FOR ANY OTHER TEST ONE OF THE IMPORTANT ROLES OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORIES IS TO PROVIDE TESTING- FOR SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES PARTICULARLY AS WE MOVE INTO A TIME WHEN TESTING IS MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE IN. HOSPITAL SETTINGS OR IN- COMMERCIAL SETTINGS. AND SO SOME OF THE PLACES WHERE PUBLIC HEALTH LABS CAN BE OF SERVICE IS IN SETTINGS WHERE PERHAPS THERE ARE CHALLENGES WITH ACCESSING THE TASK. AND SO THAT'S A PARTICULA ROLE THAT WE HAVE AND THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH SECTOR. I'M GOING FORWARD. OKAY GO AHEAD MICHAEL I AM SEASONAL THEM FOR ITS- WITH LEADERSHIP MORGAN HILL AND I'M A CHEMICAL ENGINEER SO MY QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH MITIGATION. IN TERMS OF THE SENIOR POPULATION SO ON THE WAR CHILD YOU'RE TALKING BASICALLY INFANT TO EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD SENIOR SURE TALKING SOMEWHERE FIFTY TWO UP TO A HUNDRED SO YOU HAVE A BIG VARIETY. OF PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES INTERVIEW NO RESPONSES SO WHAT WOULD BE YOUR SUGGESTION IN TERMS OF TRAVEL FOR A HEALTHY SIXTY YEAR OLD AS COMPARED TO SOMEONE YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WHO IS IMMUNO SUPPRESSED AT THE- AT THAT AGE. YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I THINK THAT- INTO SOME OF THESE DECISIONS ARE DECISIONS THAT- INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO BE THINKING ABOUT BASED ON THEIR OWN HEALTH STATUS AND POTENTIALLY IN INCOME CONSULTATION WITH THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS I WOULD CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS. TO TALK TO THEIR DOCTOR ABOUT THEM CERTAINLY THE RISK DOES INCREASE WITH AGE- ACROSS THAT SPAN OF OLDER FOLKS I'M AS WELL AS AS AS YOU MENTIONED UNDERLYING HEALTH CARE UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS- DO PLAY A ROLE- AND I THINK PEOPLE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT THEIR OWN CIRCUMSTANCES AND MAKE TO. DECISIONS THAT MAKES SENSE FOR THE FOR THEM AND WHAT THEY'RE REALITIES ARE BUT WE WOULD DEFINITELY- ENCOURAGE PEOPLE WHO ARE AT INCREASED RISK TO BE ASKING THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS. TO BE THINKING ABOUT HOW THEY CAN TAKE SOME OF THESE COMMONSENSE MEASURE LIKE REDUCING THEIR EXPOSURE TO PEOPLE IN GENERAL STAYING AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE ILL STAYING AWAY SETTING WHERE TRACK. IT COMMON OR OR OR OR. THE THANK YOU THINGS SERIOUSLY WITH TO CRUISES HAS COME OUT WITH GUIDANCE JUSTIN LAST FEW DAYS ADVISING WHO ARE OLDER OR HOW UNDER HEALTH CONDITIONS TO AVOID CRUISES- BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT'S A PLACE WHERE TRANSMISSION IF IT DOES HAPPEN- CAN HAPPEN PRETTY BROADLY SO I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION OKAY BECAUSE WHAT I'M SAYING AND BASICALLY A HEALTHY SYSTEM SAID OF THE YOUNGER SENIOR. IF YOU CALL IT. IS THAT THERE A LOT OF. INTO OUR SOME IS BECAUSE ABOUT YOU I GO TO THE SHOULD I NOW. IN A BY EVERY SET OF YOU KNOW EVERY BOTTLE OF PARRAL OR LYSOL CLEANER YOU KNOW IS IT SAFE FOR ME TO PICK UP THE GRAND KIDS FROM SCHOOL I MEAN I THINK WE'RE GENERATING A HUGE AMOUNT OF FEAR FOR. OF A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE POPULATION ONE ONLY A PORTION OF THAT. ARE REALLY HAVE THE- YOU KNOW- CONCERNS. CAN I JUST SIT ON A MAKE A COMMENT ON THAT I THINK IT'S JUST A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT- MISINFORMATION INFORMATION AND WE THIS IS VERY HELPFUL TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS DIALOGUE WITH YOU TO ME I FEEL LIKE THIS ISN'T ONE MORE OF THE DIALOGUE THAT I HAVE ALL DAY LONG LEARNING. COMMUNITIES ARE RESPONDING AND THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT THAT I THINK THAT WE AND OTHERS PROBABLY COULD BE A LITTLE MORE CLEAR- ABOUT MESSAGING WE TALKED TO POPULATIONS BECAUSE THAT. OUR AUDIENCE- BUT IF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT HERE THAT INFORMATION IF IT'S CREATING GREATER CONCERN AND WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE RESPOND TO THAT MESSAGING SO IT. MIGHT TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IS TO LOOK BACK AT OUR WEBSITE TO BE SURE THAT WE HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THAT INFORMATION ABOUT. ABOUT THAT RELATIVE RISK THAT SAID THIS IS THE WE'RE ALL LEARNING MORE ABOUT AND IT DOESN'T HURT ANY IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT. IT IS YOU ARE. ENVIRONMENT LET'S BEING WITH SIX FEET OF SOMEONE THAT IS SNEEZING PUTS YOU AT RISK IF THEY HAVE CO NINETEENTH JUST BEING AWARE OF THAT ENVIRONMENT ISN'T- BAD FOR ANY OF US AND I THINK CAN ALSO HELP BELIEVE FEAR BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW IT'S TRANSMITTED AND WE KNOW THAT WE SHOULD BE WASH YOUR HANDS FREQUENTLY AT VETERAN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS CAN. AND ALL JUST. IN UP LITTLE BIT MORE TO THAT OF HOW WE'RE LOOKING AT IT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE REALLY ASKING PEOPLE TO EVALUATE OF ALL TRAVEL. AND WHETHER IT IS ESSENTIAL OR NON ESSENTIAL AND WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO DEFINE. WHAT IS ESSENTIAL TRAVEL. AND IF- IF WE HAVE TO TRAVEL. AND WE KNOW WE WILL PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO TRAVEL. DURING THIS PERIOD OF MONTHS THEN HOW CAN WE- OUR- DURING TRAVEL. WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO. TO PROTECT OUR- DURING TRAVEL. IS THERE A WAY. TO DRIVE. RATHER THAN FLY. IS THERE A WAY. A IF YOU MUST FLY. CHECK YOURSELF IN THE ENVIRONMENT WHEN YOU'RE FLYING AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE GOOD. OF STUDIES THAT SHOW SIMPLE THINGS LIKE WASHING YOUR HANDS. BEFORE YOU ENTERED PLANE. AND AFTER YOU LEAVE THE PLANE. CAN GO A LONG. IN OF. USING THIS FIRE. I'M I HAD A QUESTION SO MAY I'M- NOT UNDERSTANDING THE HERE BUT THERE. WHAT IS THE UNIQUE OF THE VIRUS THAT IS- MAKING IT SO DIFFERENT WITH SUCH A REACTION GLOBALLY AFFECTING. ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND COUNTRIES I GUESS- WHERE ITALY HAD TO SHUT DOWN ITS BORDERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT WHAT'S THE UNIQUENESS OF THIS PARTICULAR. FEEL LIKE IT'S IT MIGHT CREATING MORE FEAR. ARE LIKE AS SOME OF THE P. HERE THIS HERE YEAH WHAT IT WHAT IS IT SO YOU. VERSUS THE FLU OR OTHER VIRAL DISEASES. I'D LIKE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IF I CAN IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION. OF SO THIS VIRUS IS A CORONA VIRUS AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF KNOWN HUMAN CORONA VIRUSES THAT WE LIVE WITH ALL THE TIME. EVERY YEAR AND THEY CALL BECAUSE JUST SIMPLE COLDS AND NO ONE EVEN THINKS ABOUT THEM. SO WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS ONE IS IT'S NEW. WE HAVE NOT SEEN IT BEFORE. SO UNLIKE OTHER VIRUSES THAT HAVE ADAPTED TO INFECT HUMAN BEINGS THAT WE LIVE WITH REGULARLY BECAUSE OUR IMMUNE SYSTEMS ARE USED TO THEM. THIS IS A NEW VIRUS. OUT WE BELIEVE IT COMES FROM AN ANIMAL AND ANIMAL ORIGIN PROBABLY A BAT AND PERHAPS ANOTHER MAMMAL THAT IT MAY HAVE INTERACTED WITH BEFORE IT CAME TO HUMANS. AND WE HAVE NO UNDERLYING IMMUNITY FOR THIS VIRUS. AND SO ESSENTIALLY EVERYONE IS POTENTIALLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE VIRUS AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT VERY UNIQUE- EVERY FLU STRAIN THAT COMES EACH YEAR OR- OR EVERY. REGULAR CORONA VIRUS THAT COMES EACH YEAR THERE'S A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE SOME IMMUNITY OR THERE MAY BE VACCINES TO HELP US BECOME MORE IMMUNE TO THE PARTICULAR VIRUS. AND IN THIS SITUATION IT'S JUST NEW AND SO THAT'S WHY IT IS DIFFERENT AND THAT'S WHY IT'S BEHAVING IN THE WAY THAT YOU'RE SAYING IT BEHAVE NOW. AND I WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK ON TO THAT JUST BECAUSE THE QUESTION THE DISTRICT OFFICE CAN WE EXPECT THE VIRUS TO DECREASE IN THE SUMMER AND GET. POTENTIALLY WORSE IN THE FALL SIMILAR TO THE SPANISH FLU IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN. THIS IS A QUESTION THAT WE GET ASKED A LOT BECAUSE- MANY RESPIRATORY VIRUSES DO EXACTLY THAT DATE THEY PEAK IN THE WINTER AND SPRING AND- DECREASE IN THE SUMMER AND THEN BEGIN TO START TO COME BACK IN THE FALL- WE DON'T KNOW YET WHAT THIS VIRUS IS GOING TO DO. I HOPE THAT WE'LL SEE SOME DECLINE IN THE SUMMER- BECAUSE OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES DO THAT BUT I CAN'T PROMISE THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN. THANK YOU SO I'M GONNA ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS FROM THE OFFICES THE DISTRICT OFFICES AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE WHAT SHOULD WE TELL CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING THEIR MEDICATION AND A POSSIBLE QUARANTINE HOW DO YOU GET EXTRA MEDICATION BEFORE IS DUE FOR A REFILL EXPRESSION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL PAY UNTIL IT IS TIME FOR A REFILL. I NEED TO GET BACK TO YOU BECAUSE OUR INSURANCE LANDSCAPE IS- VARIED AND DIVERSE AND INCLUDES BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PAYERS. SO OF WILL SEND BACK SOME RESOURCES ARE REFERENCES THAT PEOPLE CAN USE TO UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT'S GETTING OUT IS THIS QUESTION OF GENERAL PREPAREDNESS. SO THIS IS A GREAT MOMENT TO REMIND EVERYBODY WE LIVE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE WILD FIRES WE HAVE- EARTHQUAKES. WE HAVE POWER SHUT DOWNS AND NOW HAVE. WE HAVE COVERED NINETY. AND IT'S NOW A IDEA TO BE PER. ALL THE TIME FOR ANY OF THESE SO MAKING SURE THAT YOU TALK WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN AHEAD OF TIME ABOUT GETTING MEDICATIONS MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE THEM- AT HOME. IN CASE THINGS GET INCONVENIENT OR ON THERE'S A PROBLEM GET YOUR MEDICATION IT DOESN'T BECOME SOMETHING THAT LIMITS YOUR ABILITY OR GETS YOU IN- IN TROUBLE PARTICULARLY AT A TIME WHEN THERE. COULD BE A LEVEL OF INCONVENIENCE AND SOME SOCIAL DISRUPTION SO. GOOD REMINDER TO GET THOSE MEDICATIONS REFILLED. AT NICHOL. RIGHT NOW ALL I SEE WHAT HIS AND I WANTED TO GRAB IT OUT OF OUR HANDS BJ PART ALSO WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND ON BEHALF OF THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE WENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL THE WORK ALL OF YOU HAVE DONE IN CONCERT WITH US TO DEAL WITH THIS UNPRECEDENTED TIMES I HAVE A COMMON QUESTION- WE CAN'T OVER EMPHASIZE THE WORK THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO DO WITH YOU PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT RELATIVE TO THE- WELL. CAN IMAGINE STRESS THAT FEELING AN ARMORED DEPARTMENT AND I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT THAT THAT IS SOMETHING WE ARE POISED AND READY TO DOING CONTINUE TO DO WITH YOU AND THEN I HAD A KIND OF AN ODD QUESTION BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO LOOK AT IT BUT WE'VE WE'VE ALL BEEN LOOKING AT THE CHINA EXPERIENCE ARE AND IF YOU UNDERSTANDING THE ITALY EXPERIENCE IS THE DEATH RATE HIGHER THERE ARE IT SEEMS. AGAIN NOT REALLY LOOKING AT ME I THOUGHT ON THE ITALY EXPERIENCE. I'M THAT'S A TERRIFIC. I THINK. WE ARE LIKELY. LEARN FROM THE ITALY. BUT IT'S- TOO NEW SO THERE HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN ANY PUBLICATIONS COMING OUT OF ITALY DESCRIBING THINGS IN ANY DETAIL. SO BUT WE PICK THINGS CAME FROM OUR CHINESE COLLEAGUES. DID A TREMENDOUS JOB OF PROVIDING INFORMATION VERY QUICKLY AND HOPEFULLY WILL ALSO BEGIN TO SEE THINGS- FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US IN THE UNITED STATES TO SEE KIND OF THE- CITY OF WHAT HAPPENS- DIFFERENT PLACES. AND I'D JUST LIKE TO THANK THE- OF. THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION TO IT'S BEEN REMARKABLE TO. WORK WITH BOTH A CH A AND C. M. A. DURING THIS TIME AND TO ACT I FEEL A GREAT DEAL OF SUPPORT FOR OUR- TRADITIONS. GIVE VERY. AT. KELLY BEAM ON BEHALF THE CAL. MEDICAL SO. WE THE COLLAB AND I THINK THIS HEARING IS IMPORTANT AND THAT EDUCATES EVERYONE AND WE WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS OF YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE IS VERY EDUCATED ABOUT THIS IN COMBATING ALL OF THE MISINFORMATION THAT'S OUT THERE. BUT LIKE DOCTOR UNTIL SAID I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALL AND YOU KNOW BE RESPECTFUL AND ALSO COMPORT OURSELVES. AND DO WE SHOULD ALREADY BE DOING I MEAN ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU MENTIONED SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND ANOTHER SHOUT OUT TO ALL OUR PARTNERS BECAUSE ABSOLUTELY THIS IS NOT ONLY AT ALL OF GOVERNMENT IS THAT ALL OF STATE RESPONSE AND- FROM OUR ACADEMIC SETTINGS TO OUR ASSOCIATIONS ARE CARE PROVIDERS ARE. THE NACAC ALL OF YOU I. THE LIST IS A MILLION SOTHAT'S WHY WE DO SO WELL BECAUSE WE WORK WERE WORKING WELL TOGETHER SO APPRECIATED. HEY SO I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT- KIND OF HOW IT FEELS LIKE FOLKS ARE WINGING IT OUT THERE IN TERMS OF DECISIONS ARE MAKING ON BEHALF OF THE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE. JUST OBVIOUSLY THE FIELD OF SPORTS OF SOME TEAMS ARE PLAYING PHONE EMPTY STADIUM SUMMER PLAYING FULL FOR THE FULL STADIUM SUMMER. SOME SCHOOL DISTRICT- SHOWING SOME ARE NOT. IS THERE ANYWAY TO BRING CONSISTENCY OR DO WE WANT TO BRING CONSISTENCY TO THIS DECISION OR IS IT GOOD TO BE OUT OF HOCK. IS FEEL LIKE THERE'S A SENSATIONALISM OR ON ALL THESE. DECISIONS TO MAKE BIG MOVES TO CANCEL CONCERTS AT SUCH A- AND JUST LOSE THE REST OF US WONDERING WHAT'S THE RIGHT IDEA WHAT'S NOT. THANK ECHOING WHEN I KNOW WE KEEP SAYING BUT THIS IS OF ALL BEING INCREDIBLY RAPIDLY AND WHEN EVER ANYTHING INVOLVES RAPIDLY. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A DIVERSITY OF RESPONSES AND- IT TO WARD THAT AND TO WORDS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT REALLY TRYING TO CREATE. CONSISTENCY IN OUR STATE. THE WAY WE AT YOU KNOW. HAVE THE WAY WE WORK IS. WE HAVE A VERY STRONG AND VERY- KNOWLEDGEABLE LOCAL- GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND AS A STATE WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM AND SO OUR STATE IS SO LARGE WE WILL SEE DIVERSITY ON THE WAY THINGS ARE HANDLED BUT OUR RESPONSIBILITY ALSO AT THE STATE LEVEL IS TO ISSUE GUIDANCE WHEN THE EVIDENCE IS VERY CLEAR THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE SO YOU CAN ANTICIPATE SEEING GUIDANCE- FORTHCOMING SOON REGARDING MANY OF THE THINGS THAT YOU WERE MENTIONING AND THEY CONTINUE TO ROLL OUT AND THERE ARE MANY ALREADY GUIDANCE IS OUT ABOUT- ABOUT GATHERINGS IT SAID DR BUT BUT AS THIS PROGRESSES AND WE SEE WHERE THE VIRUSES GOING AND WE CONTINUE TO SEE THE NUMBERS INCREASING. YOU'LL SEE OFF MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT- AT LARGER GATHERINGS AS WELL. LET ME LET ME TAKE A THE A FEW OF THESE AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO WRAP UP WITH YOUR JOB IN THERE. OKAY I JUST WANNA GET SOME OF OUR DISTRICT EMAILS SO THAT. THEY GET SOME WORK SOME. TO ANSWER. SHOULD VISIT TO THE CAPITOL BUILDING SUCH AS LOBBYING ORGANIZATIONS CONSIDER SCALING BACK IN. BACK IN PERSON VISITS WHAT IF THEY FALL INTO THE HIGHER RISK CATEGORY OR LIVE WITH FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE AT HIGHER RISK SHOULD THEY BE HERE. I CAN I CAN TAKE THAT ONE- WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT ALL PEOPLE- CONSIDER. ARE THE ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'RE ENGAGING IN AND WHETHER THE AT THERE IS ADDITIONAL RISK THEY THEY SHOULD KNOW IF THEY FALL IN A PARTICULAR RISK CATEGORY AND- AND WHAT THEY CAN DO TO MINIMIZE THEIR EXPOSURE. PARTICULARLY IN THIS TIME WHEN WE'RE ENGAGED IN ACTIVE MITIGATION TRYING TO DECREASE THOSE CHAINS OF TRANSMISSION- WOULD BE BEST FOR THEM TO. EITHER PARTICIPATE AT DISTANCE OR TO FOR GO PARTICIPATION. OKAY AT ANY POINT WITH THE STATE CONSIDER COMPLETE SHUT DOWN OF SCHOOLS AND LARGE GATHERINGS. I KNOW THAT SCHOOLS IN LARGE GATHERINGS ARE ARE SOMETHING THAT'S ON THE MIND OF MANY PEOPLE- WE ARE CONTINUOUSLY LOOKING AT THE PATTERN OF MOVEMENT OF THIS DISEASE ACROSS OUR STATES ARE COMMUNITIES IN THE IMPLICATION OUR OUR OUR COUNTIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE IMPLICATIONS THAT HAS. IN TERMS OF PROTECTING MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR UP MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND ARE CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND ANY DECISIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MAKE WILL REALLY BE GUIDED BY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THOSE DECISIONS THE IMPACT IT CAN HAVE ON HELPING TO PROTECT THOSE TWO SYSTEMS SO- THAT'S TO SAY. IT. INTERVENTIONS ARE REALLY NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE HELP CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU I JUST HAVE TO MORE THAN ALL HAVE HIM FINISH APART HER PARA A BRIEFING FOR TODAY CAN THE PANEL SPEAK ABOUT AS MUCH AS A RISK FACTOR FOR MORE SEVERE COVERT ILLNESS FOR BOTH THE ADULT AND CHILDREN POPULATION SHOULD PEOPLE AS MY EVEN MILD ASTHMA. BE TAKING GREATER PRECAUTIONS NOW. I WILL COMMENT ON CHILDHOOD ASTHMA. ALL RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS ARE A RISK FOR CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA. AND IT IS COMMON PRACTICE FOR PEDIATRICIANS TO DISCUSS THIS WITH FAMILIES- TO PREPARE THEM IN THE FALL FOR THE FOR GOING THROUGH WINTER RESPIRATORY SEASON. SO WE ROUTINELY RECOMMEND INFLUENZA VACCINATION AND- MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE TAKING THEIR PREVENTATIVE MEDICATIONS AND THAT THEY HAVE THEIR USUAL. OF MEDICATION SUCH AS INHALERS IF THEY WERE TO HAVE AN ATTACK. AT HAND SO THIS IS COMMON PRACTICE OF FOR ALL CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA DURING RESPIRATORY SEASON AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT THIS RESPIRATORY VIRUS LIKE ALL OTHERS. WOULD POSE A RISK FOR CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA. THANK YOU ONE MORE QUESTION A- DISTURBANCE SPEAK IS THERE A PLAN TO NOTIFY LEGISLATIVE OFFICES WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A COVERT NINETEEN DEATH IN THEIR DISTRICT SO THAT THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICE CAN RESPOND TO COMMUNITY CONCERNS. SURE SO WE HAVE BEEN- PROVIDING INFORMATION ABOUT CASES ON OUR WEBSITE AND- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT- INCLUDES THE DESK THAT WE'VE HAD IN CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE HAD SOME- AND SO IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE OF. BENEFIT TO LEGISLATIVE OFFICES THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO WE'RE WE'RE COMMITTED TO MAKING INFORMATION AVAILABLE- TO THE COMMUNITY- ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THIS DISEASE- AND I THINK THAT- THAT HELPS PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING AND FEEL LIKE- YOU KNOW- THE PARTNERSHIP WITH. WITH THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE IS THERE AND THAT THEY CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE IN WHAT THEY'RE SEEING AND KNOW WHERE TO GO TO GET GOOD INFORMATION. THANK YOU GO AHEAD. THANKS RICHARD WITH BLUE SHIELD OF CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION AGAIN ACTUALLY TWO LAST QUESTIONS WANT WANT TO COME BACK TO THE QUESTION ABOUT IF YOUR UNINSURED AND YOU WANT TO GET TESTED WHAT DO YOU DO I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR- THE WRIST ANSWER THEIR- SECOND QUESTION FOR DOCTOR BYINGTON LOOKING AT THE ITALY EXPERIENCE IT LOOKS LIKE THE KEY ONE OF THE KEY THINGS THAT HAPPENS IS THAT ARE ICY USE GET OVERWHELMED PRETTY QUICKLY. SOME WONDERING HOW YOU SEE IS PLANNING FOR THAT EVENTUALITY AND THINKING ABOUT THAT- HAPPENING OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS SO ALL OF THE UC HOSPITALS HAVE SURGE PLANS THAT ARE OF DEVELOPED IN IN PLACE SO SHOULD WE HAVE A SURGEON OR AGENCY AND OUR INTENSIVE CARE UNITS- ARE ARE QUITE- INVOLVED IN THE PREPARATION OF THOSE PLANS WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THE NUMBER OF VENTILATORS FOR EXAMPLE THAT WE. HOW MUCH STAFFING WE WOULD NEED TO CONVERT THINGS LIKE OUR- HOSPITAL- ARE ARE SORRY OUR SURGICAL RECOVERY ROOMS INTO ADDITIONAL BEDS SO THERE THERE IS- CERTAINLY SEARCH PLANNING- I AGREE WITH YOU THAT ALTHOUGH THE EXPERIENCE WITH ITALY IS SHORT SO FAR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS COME OUT DISTINCT FROM CHINA IS THE NEED FOR INTENSIVE CARE UNIT BEDS CHINA WAS ABLE TO BUILD TWO. HOSPITALS TWO ONE THOUSAND BED HOSPITALS IN A TWO WEEK PERIOD FOR COBIT PATIENTS I DON'T BELIEVE THAT ITALY WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND I KNOW THAT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO WE ARE REALLY LOOKING AT SEARCH ALL A QUESTION OF- OF THE UNINSURED. THE UC HEALTH SYSTEM ALREADY CARES FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF UNINSURED PATIENTS ACROSS- OF CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE TESTING EVERYONE WHO COMES TO US THAT NEEDS A MEDICAL TEST AND WE HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO TEST FIRST AND WE WILL FIGURE OUT THE PAYMENT MODEL SECOND I AM HOPING THAT THERE WILL BE SOME KIND OF FEDERAL LEAVE FOR HOSPITAL WHO ARE MAKING INVESTMENTS THAT WILL BE UNREIMBURSED- THROUGH THE NORMAL A PAIR MECHANISM. WE'VE DONE A NUMBER OF THINGS LIKE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW- OF NEW BETS WE'VE- WE RUN AN INCIDENT COMMAND CENTER OR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THESE ARE REAL OF CALL UP IN THAT IT WILL NEVER BE REIMBURSED BY INSURANCE SO I BELIEVE THAT AS AS AS A- NATION WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT HOW WE WILL- PROVIDE RELIEF FOR THESE THAT'S WHEN THE FOR. AND NOTE THAT ON MARCH FIFTH THE GOVERNOR AND NOW THE- ELIMINATING COST SHARING- RELATED TO COPAYS ETCETERA FOR THOSE PARTICULARLY IN CALIFORNIA'S COMMERCIAL HEALTH CARE PLANS ALSO TO COMPLIMENT ALL OF THE OTHER WAYS IN WHICH WE- SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS NEEDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY TESTS FOR KOBE NINETEEN. AT LAST QUESTION PROMISE ARE YOU HAD MENTIONED ON ONE OF OUR PANELISTS MENTIONED ABOUT COMMERCIAL BASKETS WERE IT WILL THERE BE GUIDANCE ON YOU KNOW USING WE SHOULD BE BY BECAUSE I COULD JUST ENVISION. IF WE ARE PANIC BUYING ON TOILET PAPER PAPER TOWEL AND WATER RIGHT NOW WE WILL A LOT OF OUR POPULATION WILL PROBABLY BE PANIC BUYING ON THIS COMMERCIAL DESK AT SCHOOL COULD YOU JUST AB WILL THERE BE FORTHCOMING GUIDANCE COULD SOMEBODY JUST ADDRESS THAT PLEASE. SURE THANK YOU- I THINK I WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE THAT WE WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TALK TO THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY NEED TO BE TESTED. SO THIS TEST LIKE ANY OTHER MEDICAL CAST- SHOULD BE. DONE WHEN IT'S MEDICALLY NECESSARY SO WE WOULD NOT THAT AND THERE WILL NOT. BE THERE'S NOT A PLAN RIGHT NOW TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE AN OVER THE COUNTER TYPE OF TEST- BUT IF PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY ARE ILL AND NEED. AND NEED CARE. THEY SHOULD TALK TO THEIR DOCTOR IN CONSULTATION WITH OUR DOCTOR THERE WOULD BE A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER DOING THIS TEST. MAKES SENSE OR NOT. OKAY THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR COMING THANK YOU PANELISTS. I WANT TO PUT SOME LEVITY INTO THIS WE'VE BEEN ASKED WHY ARE WE ALL SITTING APART FROM EACH OTHER. AD SO WHY WE'RE DOING THAT IS WERE ROLE MODELING HOW WE WANT YOU TO SIT WHEN WE WHEN WE CONSIDER SOCIAL DISTANCING AT THIS TIME WE ALL STILL LIKE EACH OTHER. ANYWAY BEFORE WE ADJOURN WE WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT CLOROX WIPES AND HAND SANITIZERS CAN BE ORDERED THROUGH THE SUDDENLY AND SENATE INTRANET THESE ITEMS MAY BE ON BACK ORDER BUT ORDER ANYWAY THESE ITEMS ARE NOT ARE ARE FOR STAFF AT WORK NOT FOR CONSTITUENTS OVER THE STAFF TAKE HOME. PLEASE BE PREPARED PRUDENT WHEN ORDERING LASTLY REMEMBER THAT YOUR BEST DEFENSE IS GOOD HAND HYGIENE AND RESPIRATORY ETIQUETTE. IF YOU HAVE A FEVER STAY HOME SELF ISOLATING CONTRACTORS PROVIDER AND HUMAN RESOURCES IF YOU NEED HELP ED IF YOU STAY HOME WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER THANK YOU FOR COMING HAVE A GREAT AFTERNOON.
