CHAIR AND IF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SAM BRINTON I SERVICE HEAD OF ADVOCACY IN GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE TREVOR PROJECT WE WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB SIX FIFTY WHICH WOULD EXPAND THE EFFORTS TO COLLECT LGBT Q. MORTALITY DATA. AS WE KNOW IF THE TREVOR PROJECT IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST SUICIDE PREVENTION AND CRISIS INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR LG TO YOUTH AND WE WORK EVERY DAY TO SAVE LIVES BY PROVIDING SUPPORT. TO OUR FREE AND CONFIDENTIAL SUICIDE PREVENTION SERVICES. UNFORTUNATELY DATA ON THE SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO SUFFER VIOLENT DEATH SUCH AS HOMICIDE AND SUICIDE IS RARELY COLLECTED IN FACT WITH THE TREVOR PROJECT RECENTLY COLLABORATE WITH THE CDC AND THE NATIONAL VIOLENT DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM. WE FOUND ONLY EIGHT STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY EVEN REPORTING ANY VIOLENT DEATH OF A TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUAL OVER THE LAST DECADE WITH ONLY TWELVE TOTAL DEATHS RECORDED. THIS IS CLEARLY AN ACCURATE NOT CORRECTLY COUNTING THESE DEATHS CONTRIBUTE TO THE ONGOING HEALTH CRISIS OF VIOLENCE TOWARDS DRESS TRANSGENDER PEOPLE ESPECIALLY TRANSGENDER WOMEN OF COLOR. AB SIX FIFTY WILL BUILD UPON CALIFORNIA'S WORK AND GUARANTEEING OF QUALITY FOR L. TO KILL PEOPLE BY EXPANDING OUR EFFORTS TO COLLECT THIS DATA. THEREFORE FOR FOR THESE REASONS THE TREVOR PROJECT STRONG SUPPORT AB SIX FIFTY AND I WALK MANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES OPPOSITION.

THAT WAS EITHER SOUGHT OR OBTAINED ON THE BASIS OF RACE AND ALLOW THE CONDEMNED PRISONER TO ALLOW THEIR CONVICTION AND SENTENCE IF THERE IS EVIDENCE OF RACIAL BIAS IN THE TRIAL. OR SENTENCING CALIFORNIA'S DEATH ROW IS THE LARGEST IN THE US WITH SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN CONDEMNED PRISONERS AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS REPRESENTS WE KNOW THAT US ATTORNEYS HAVE RECOMMENDED THE DEATH PENALTY IN DEFENDANTS AND BLACK AND WHITE AND NON BLACK VICTIMS BUT ONLY DEFENDANTS AND BLACK VICTIMS.

MS BAUER QUE HANNAH IS WE HAVE NO ONE HERE YOU MAY PRESENT. ITEM. TWENTY SIX AB TWELVE SIXTEEN POWER QUE HAN IS COMING BACK TO THE PODIUM. MOVED TO BAIL TO HAVE A SUPPORT SUPPORT OUT. IT'S WE GET SUPPORT WOULD NO FORMAL OPPOSITION THANK YOU. I STAND CORRECTED [inaudible] HELLO. TODAY I AM HERE THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE WE ARE PRESENTING ON A. B. TWELVE SIXTEEN WHICH WILL CREATE A PILOT PROJECT BROWNIE AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTIES TO TACKLE THE ISSUE OF ILLEGAL DUMPING. WHICH IS PROVEN TO BE A HARD CHALLENGE FOR THE COUNTIES AND ONE IN WHICH THEY ARE SEEKING OUR ASSISTANCE IN ENSURING WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PREVENT. SO I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MY WITNESS AT LEAST SAM BACK WHO IS WITH THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. GOOD MORNING YES I'M WITH THE DA'S OFFICE IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL SECTION OF ALAMEDA COUNTY DA'S OFFICE. ON BEHALF OF NANCY O'MALLEY IN SUPPORT OF TWELVE SIXTEEN I'VE BEEN IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL UNIT SINCE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND TWO AND WE WERE COMMONLY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AROUND THE STATE SO I HAVE SOME PERSPECTIVE ON THE PROBLEM OF ILLEGAL DUMPING. ABOUT A YEAR AGO OF ONE OF THE WE STARTED TO FORM OF WORKING GROUP AND ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERVISOR NATE MILEY SPEAR HEAD SPEARHEADED THE EFFORT. WE HAD PUBLIC WORKS AT THE TABLE -- CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICES SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT MY OFFICE AND OUR INSPECTORS START TO DO SOME INVESTIGATIONS ON CAMERAS CAMERA HITS EVIDENTIARY LEADS FROM LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES AND WE LEARNED SOME THINGS -- BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED IS THAT IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL DUMPING COMMUNITY AND IT'S OFTEN FALLS ON THE SHOULDERS OF A PUBLIC WORKS IS THAT THE BIG PROBLEM. IS THIS. WHEN PEOPLE? JUMP AND PUBLIC WORKS PICKS IT UP THEY JUST KEEP DUMPING. AND THAT THEY TALK ABOUT THE THREE EASE AND THE ILLEGAL DUMPING COMMUNITY THAT'S A RATIFICATION. EDUCATION AND ENFORCEMENT. THERE'S PLENTY OF A RATIFICATION WE'RE ALL PAYING FOR IT. THERE'S PLENTY OF EDUCATION WE ALL SEE THE YOU KNOW. MESSAGING OUT THERE. BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF ENFORCEMENT. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES OUR FOCUS ON VIOLENT CRIMES SERIOUS CRIMES AND ILLEGAL DUMPING CASES. ARE SUPER EASY TO INVESTIGATE YOU START OFF TYPICALLY WITH A CAMERA LEAD IN THE LICENSE PLATE THE PERSON DRIVING THE CAR MAY NOT BE. OFTEN IS NOT THE PERSON. THAT THE RIGHT IS THE REGISTERED OWNER. SO ENFORCEMENT IS SERIOUSLY LACKING SO WE'VE DEVELOPED. AN INCIPIENT COMMUNITY REALLY AND TALK TO OUR COLLEAGUES AND WHAT WE ARE HOPING IS THAT THIS PILOT PROGRAM WILL DEVELOP SOME EXPERTISE HELP US DEVELOP THIS COMMUNITY. AND HELP US DEVELOP SOME CASES THAT WE CAN PUBLICIZE SO THAT THE PUBLIC DOESN'T THINK NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN -- AND IT IS OUR HOPE THAT BASED ON THAT BET. WE CAN RETURN TO COMMUNITIES LIKE THIS ONE IN EAST OAKLAND WHERE WE MET WITH. DURING SCHOOL HOURS WE MET WITH KIDS WITH SIGNS WE MET WITH LITERALLY CRYING MOTHERS WHO ARE SAYING DO SOMETHING BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE NOBODY CARES. AND WE D. A.'S ARE VERY FRUSTRATED. BECAUSE THE LACK OF INVESTIGATIONS IS NOT BRINGING US CASES AND WE WANT TO SHOW THAT IF WE INVESTIGATE SOME CASES I MEAN FOR SOME SORT TO SOME DETERRENCE HERE. THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WHEN YOU HAVE A CITIZEN WILLING TO STICK THEIR NECK OUT AND VIDEOTAPE SOMEBODY ACTUALLY DUMPING AND YOU LEARNED THAT NOTHING HAPPENED WHEN THEY WERE WILLING TO TAKE THAT RISK -- IT'S AS I SAID VERY FRUSTRATING SO WE'RE HOPING TO LEARN SOME LESSONS HERE -- OUR INVESTIGATORS WHEN THEY WORKED UP THESE CASES HAVE INTERVIEWED -- SUSPECTS. WHY DID YOU DUMP WHAT WOULD CHANGE YOUR MIND WHAT KIND OF MESSAGING MIGHT AFFECT YOU -- SO. IN BRIEF THAT'S WEBER SUPPORTING THIS THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MR QUIRK AT THE WHICH FIRST AND THEN MISTER ACT OKAY -- SO IT IS VERY HARD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS HAYWARD THE CITY I WAS ON THE COUNCIL OF SPENDS MILLION SPENT. TEN YEARS AGO MILLION DOLLARS YEAR ON THIS IT'S PROBABLY MORE NOW -- MY ONLY CONCERN ABOUT THIS IS THAT I'M NOT SURE IT'LL GET THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS BECAUSE THE STATE IS I READ THIS. IS FUNDING THE POSITION. AND IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF YOU COULD JUST HAND AROUND THE CUP TO THE CITIES IN THE COUNTY AND HAVE THEM. PUT THE MONEY FORWARD MY MY CONCERN IS IN APPROPRIATIONS TOP EASILY GREAT POLICY IT'S HARD TO GET GOOD POLICIES IN THIS. I'VE TRIED -- SO THAT'S MY ONLY SUGGESTION THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU BYE AND EDIT VOTE MISTER LACKEY YEAH MY COMMENT WAS SIMILAR I DON'T I DIDN'T EVEN SEE AN APPROPRIATION IN THIS BILL. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY I COULD TAKE IT. TO IT'S AN IMMENSE PROBLEM WHERE I LIVE -- BECAUSE WE LIVE IN DESERT AREA. AND WE HAVE SOME PROFESSIONAL NUMBERS. IT REALLY IS THAT BIG OF A DEAL I MEAN WE HAVE -- A REAL PROBLEM WITH MEDICAL SUPPLIES BEING DUMPED IN THE DESERT -- CONSTRUCTION OBVIOUSLY PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE JUST DUMPING IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE SO THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS STATEWIDE PROBLEM HOWEVER. I IT I AM A BIG BELIEVER THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. UNDERSTANDS THE COMPLEXITY AND THE UNIQUE NATURE IN EACH SPECIFIC AREA AND I WORRY THAT WE'RE OPENING. A DOOR THAT WE REALLY. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT SERVES THE STATE WIDE INTEREST. IN THE RELYING ON THE STATE TO TO REMEDY THIS OF THAT THAT'S MY HESITATION [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] MAY I ADDRESS. COM YOU CAN CALL ME LOW. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. COMMENTS YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU SO I'M JUST FOR CLARIFICATION THE BILL IS -- YOU KNOW UPON APPROPRIATION FROM BUDGET AND WE DID DO A BUDGET ASK OF THE MONEY NECESSARY TO DO. THIS PROGRAM AND YOU KNOW I CONCUR WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THAT HAVING DONE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW WORK MYSELF I'VE SEEN THIS AND ALSO THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT WHEN YOU DUMP A FRIDGE FULL OF FREON NEXT TO A CREEK THERE'S AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THAT. AND SO IT'S WE NEED TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENING THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN PUT FORWARD A PROGRAM. THAT SHOWS BEST PRACTICES AND REALLY ATTACKS THIS IT'S IMPORTANT. BOTH LOCALLY BUT ALSO ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL AND SO WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT REALLY WILL HAVE POSITIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND PUBLIC SAFETY IMPACTS OF WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE THAT. THANK YOU -- CHAIRS RECOMMENDED I AND MORE SO NOW AFTER LISTENING TO TO TO COMMENT FROM. TWO MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FROM TWO SEPARATE PARTS OF QUÃª NHÃ . THANK YOU PROBLEMS IT. KIND OF SHOWS HOW THIS IS. A STATEWIDE PROBLEM AND SO -- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BOARD THANK YOU. ON A. B.

TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS ONE YEAR IN COUNTY JAIL OR BOTH HOWEVER ASSAULT ON HOSPITAL GROUNDS AGAINST A HEALTHCARE WORKER. ARE NOT TREATED THE SAME THIS BILL SIMPLY CREATING UNIFORMITY IN THE PENAL CODE. I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY THIRTY YEARS EXPERIENCE AS A FIRST RESPONDER VIOLENCE IN THE HOUSE WAS MORE COMMON THAN WE THINK. IN A SURVEY DONE BY THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS THEY HAVE BEEN PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED. AND 71% HAVE WITNESSED AN ASSAULT. MORE SPECIFICALLY INSIDE THE MERGING APARTMENT WHERE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT STRESS BOTH STAFF AND PATIENTS ARE BEING AFFECTED. WHEN VIOLENCE OCCURS IN THE MERGING APARTMENT PATIENTS CAN BE INJURED OR TRAUMATIZED TO THE POINT? THAT THEY LEAVE AND DO NOT GET SEEN. THERE'S ALSO AN INCREASED WAIT TIMES. AND DISTRACT MERCY STAFF FROM FOCUSING ON OTHER PATIENTS WHO URGENTLY REQUIRE A MEDICAL ASSISTANCE. HERE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL OF EMERGING NURSE SO NURSES ASSOCIATION. ISM SHAR RIVERA AND FROM SCRIPTS HEALTH MERRY. HOLDEN. MOVE THE BELL. THANK YOU. YOU HAVE. FIVE MINUTES WITH ALL YOUR WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MICHELLE EVER AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT AND TESTIFY FOR ASSEMBLY BILL. THREE TWENTY NINE I'VE BEEN EMERGENCY ROOM NURSE FOR FOURTEEN YEARS AND IS NEVER EASY TO ADMIT THAT I'M A VICTIM. OF ASSAULT AT WORK. I WENT TO SCHOOL TO LEARN HOW TO HELP PEOPLE AND ADVOCATE FOR MY PATIENTS HOWEVER TODAY I'M HERE TO ADVOCATE FOR MY PEERS AND MYSELF. TO MAKE SURE OUR WORK ENVIRONMENT IS SAFE. I ONCE HAD A PATIENT THAT WANTED TO GO OUTSIDE AND SMOKE I EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT THAT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE THEY CONTINUE TO WALK PAST ME AND PUSHED. MY SHOULDER AS I CONTINUED AS HE CONTINUED TO PUSH ME HE THEN GRABBED MY GLASSES AND PUSHED ME IN AND PUNCH ME IN THE FACE UNFORTUNATELY THE PLACE COULD NOT ARREST HIM. THEY SAID I HAD TO MAKE A CITIZEN'S ARREST AND GUARANTEE I WOULD SHOW UP IN COURT ONCE I FOLLOW THEIR INSTRUCTIONS THEY DETAINED HIM. THIS WAS AN EXPERIENCE I WOULD NEVER FORGET AND ONE I DID NOT EXPECT THE SAME PATIENT THEN CAME BACK TO THE E. R. SEVERAL MONTHS LATER. I NOTIFIED THE CHARGE NURSE AND I THAT I COULD NOT CARE FOR HIM AS HE HAD ASSAULTED ME IN THE PAST AND THAT WE NEEDED TO BE CAREFUL. IN OUR EMERGENCY ROOM WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASE OF PATIENTS THAT ARE BECOMING ANGRY WHEN DISCHARGED SOME PATIENTS WILL EVEN THROW THINGS OFF THE COUNTER AS THEY ARE LEAVING. IN SEPARATE OCCASION I HAD A DISCHARGED PATIENTS THAT DID NOT WANT TO BE LEAVE BECAUSE HE WAS HIDING FROM A GANG WHO WAS AFTER HIM. HE WAS ALSO IN ANOTHER GAME I GAVE HIM. ANA DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS HE THEN LOOKED OVER AT THE NURSES STATION. ON AND SAID I AM GOING TO LET BLOODY THAT BE. AS I ADDRESSED HIM AS I ADDRESSES WHAT THE OFFICER IN OUR DEPARTMENT THE PATIENT WENT TO THE BATHROOM AND STARTED HITTING THE WALLS IN THE MAYOR. SECURITY WAS CALLED THE POLICE WALKED HIM OUT THE DOOR. THEY THEN CONTINUED TO ASSAULTS THE RESPONDING OFFICER AND A FIREFIGHTER. I WAS SO AFRAID THAT HE WOULD COME BACK THAT DAY I REFUSED TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL FOR MY LUNCH BREAK. THE HOSPITAL HAVE INCREASED VIOLENCE AWARENESS AND PREVENTION PROTOCOLS WE HAVE SAFETY EMERGENCY BUTTONS IN THE PATIENT'S ROOM AND HAVE BEEN GIVEN WESSELS. BUT YET THE VIOLENCE CONTINUES PATIENTS HAVE BEEN SO AFRAID THAT THEY HAVE HAD TO PUSH THE EMERGENCY BUTTONS MULTIPLE TIMES. FIGHTS HAVE BROKEN OUT MORE WAITING ROOMS WHICH IN TURN BECAUSE PATIENTS AND VISITORS TO LEAVE WHICH MEANS THAT THEY WILL NOT RECEIVE THE MEDICAL SERVICES. ON A THEY NEED WE ARE CONTINUING. TO PUSH EFFORTS THAT WILL KEEP MY COLLEAGUES. ON AND I SAFE FOR THESE REASONS I AM IN SUPPORT OF AB. THREE TWENTY NINE GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MERRY PRE HOLDEN I'M A SECOND GENERATION REGISTERED NURSE. WHO WAS VICIOUSLY ASSAULTED BY A PATIENT IN MY HOSPITAL ON AUGUST NINTH? TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AS A RESULT OF THIS ATTACK I NEARLY LOST MY RIGHT EYE I HAVE PERMANENT SCARRING ON MY RIGHT BREAST IN MY LIFE IN PRACTICE OF NURSING HAS BEEN FOREVER CHANGED. MY PERPETRATOR WAS CHARGED WITH A FELONY ASSAULT ONLY BECAUSE HE THREW A CHAIR AT ME THAT WAY TWENTY FIVE POUNDS. THE CHAIR NEVER TOUCHED ME. YET THIS WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS ATTACK ASSAULT AND BATTERY WITH A DEADLY WEAPON INTENDED TO CROSS GREAT BODILY HARM. NOT BECAUSE HE PUNCHED ME KICKED ME AND BIT ME. I SUPPORT AB THREE TWENTY NINE BECAUSE IT ALLOWS HOSPITALS TO POST NOTICES ABOUT POSSIBLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES TO DETERMINE VIOLENT. CONDUCT IN A LINE'S CURRENT ENHANCED PENALTIES FOR BATTERIES THAT OCCUR. EXCUSE ME ON HOSPITAL PROPERTY WITH PENALTIES FOR ASSAULTS THAT OCCUR ON HOSPITAL PROPERTY FOR THESE REASONS AND MANY MORE I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. YOUR SUPPORT ON AB THREE TWENTY NINE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESS. OKAY ANY OTHER WITNESSES. NAME AN ORGANIZATION. CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS SOCIAL NOT IN HOSPITALS SUCH FISHMAN SPORT. THANK YOU SIR. MR MEMBERS TO MAN REPS IN WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP HEALTH CARE DISTRICT IN FREMONT AND ALSO THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER THE MERRITT COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR. I AM WORKING WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS IN SUPPORT. YOU. KIM STONE STONE ADVOCACY FOR THE CALIFORNIA ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING IS CHAU MUCH LEARNED HALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION COULD YOU. JUST MAKE ROOM FOR ONE MORE THANK YOU [inaudible] SURE. A GOOD MORNING MARK -- GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION -- FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE AMENDMENT OF THE BILL APPRECIATE THAT -- ALSO I WANT TO SAY I AM REALLY SORRY FOR THE INJURIES THAT YOU SUFFERED I THINK OF EMERGENCY ROOM STAFF AND NURSES. AND DOCTORS IS BEING A CAN TO PUBLIC DEFENDERS WHO WERE ALSO DEALING WITH ANGRY AND DISORIENTED AND SOMETIMES MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE. I DO WANT TO SAY THE JURY BROWN SAID IN HIS VETO MESSAGE OF THE FORMER VERSION OF THIS BILL. THAT EMERGENCY ROOMS ARE OVERCROWDED AND OFTEN CHAOTIC. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE WORK DONE BY EMERGENCY ROOM STAFF AND I RECOGNIZE THE DAUNTING CHALLENGES THEY FACE EVERY DAY. THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY -- SIMPLE ASSAULT OR BATTERY IS CURRENTLY -- MYSTERY MISDEMEANOR BUT THERE'S A BROAD SPECTRUM OF THIS. CONDUCT CAN'T THAT CAN AND USUALLY IS CHARGED AS FELONIES ALREADY. IF OF AN ASSAULT WAS MADE WITH A DEADLY WEAPON AS IT WAS IN YOUR CASE WITH THE CHAIR OR IF YOU KNOW YOU SUFFER INJURIES. ON THE KIND OF INJURIES THAT -- LIKE ALMOST LOSING YOUR ON MY I DON'T THINK THAT AB THREE TWENTY NINE IS GONNA TO TEAR THE BIT DETERRENT THE BEHAVIOR OR ENHANCE SAFETY -- WE FREQUENTLY WORK WITH INDIVIDUALS IN NEED OF MEDICAL ASSISTANCE THAT ARE TAKEN TO HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. AND THERE ARE AS I SAID BEFORE MENTALLY ILL MAY BE COMING DOWN FROM BEING HIGH ON DRUGS OR MEDICATION OR THEY MIGHT BE ON THE VICTIMS OF VIOLENT ASSAULTS THEMSELVES. ON AND OFTEN DISTRESS FAMILY MEMBERS COME TO SEE YOUR SUPPORT THEM. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TAKEN TO PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY ROOMS BECAUSE THEY ARE PSYCHOTIC OR DANGER TO SELF OR OTHERS. ARE NOT GOING TO BE DETERRED BY READING A NOTICE ON THE WALL -- THE SAME WITH GERIATRIC PATIENTS -- SO YOU KNOW OUR BASIC PHILOSOPHY IS MASS INCARCERATION IS NOT THE ANSWER TO EVERY PROBLEM. IN RESEARCHING THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL -- I FOUND THAT THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HOSPITALS AND ACTUALLY COME UP WITH THE BEHAVIORAL MANAGEMENT TRAINING PROGRAM. WHICH IT DOES REDUCE VIOLENCE AGAINST MEDICAL STAFF. AND IT STARTS WITH A COMMUNICATION TRAINING TO DEAL WITH VERBAL CONFLICTS WITH PATIENTS. TO LEARN HOW TO ESCAPE A PATIENT'S GROW UP WITHOUT HURTING THE PATIENT OR BEING HURT YOURSELF. AND TO LEARN HOW TO WORK IN A TEAM TO SAFELY CONTAIN A PATIENT. SO WE BELIEVE THAT'S A BETTER SOLUTION. TO THIS PROBLEM AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU. KATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING ON THE AMENDMENTS -- BUT WE WE STILL MUST OPPOSE AB -- THREE TWENTY NINE INCREASING THE PENALTY FOR ASSAULTS WHEN COMMITTED IN HOSPITALS. SIMPLY WILL NOT LESSEN THE FREQUENCY OF SUCH OF ASSAULTS -- IN MANY CASES AN ASSAULT IN THE HOSPITAL IS CARRIED OUT BY SOMEONE IN SEVERE DISTRESS. AND THE POTENTIAL CRIMINAL PENALTY WHICH IS ALREADY -- INCLUDES CHIP POTENTIAL JAIL TIME WILL DO NOTHING TO DETER THE PERSON WHO IS ACTING OUT OF EXTREME EMOTION. THERE ARE MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS TO STOP SUCH INCIDENTS SUCH AS MY COLLEAGUE JUST A SPEAKING ABOUT -- BUT ALSO INCLUDING JUST THE PRESENCE OF ADEQUATE SECURITY PERSONNEL WHO CAN INTERVENE IN A SITUATION AND ALSO -- TRAINING FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS IN HOW TO DEAL WITH PATIENTS WHEN THEY BECOME AGITATED WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU ARE THERE. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. DANIEL TEARS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE AN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU SIR. ANYONE ELSE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE COMMON. MR QUIRK -- I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT SOLUTION -- BUT I DO THINK IT'S A BIG PROBLEM AND I HOPE YOU'LL THINK ABOUT OTHER SOLUTIONS GOING FORWARD -- BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A BIG PROBLEM I WILL VOTE FOR THE BILL BUT I THINK. WHAT'S THE FRACTION OF PEOPLE IN OUR JAILS WHO ARE MENTALLY DERANGED IS IT HALF. AND THE BEHAVIOR I HEARD FROM THESE FOLKS. SOUNDS LIKE IT'S MENTALLY DERANGED I I DOUBT THAT A SIGN IS GOING TO MATTER. AND THAT IF SIX MONTHS IN JAIL ISN'T ENOUGH THAT A YEAR WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. BUT I DO THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PROBLEM AND I HOPE YOU'LL THINK ABOUT OF THE SOLUTIONS AS IT MOVES FORWARD BECAUSE I JUST DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO WORK. BUT AGAIN BECAUSE THE SEVERITY OF THE PROBLEM I WILL BE VOTING ON THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER LACKEY. YEAH I JUST WOULD LIKE -- TO SAY THANKYOU FOR THIS -- IN MY EXPERIENCE. AS A A HI PATROL OFFICER IN WORKING. THE SHIP THAT I CHOSE TO WORK. I SAW A NUMBER OF THESE VERY TRAGIC CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE TO SAY. THE RULES ALTHOUGH STATISTICS INDICATE THAT. MENTAL ILLNESS ATTRIBUTES TO A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE. THERE ARE STILL. A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE WHO DO NOT HAVE THIS CONDITION. WHO ARE JUST? FOR SOME REASON OR ANOTHER HAVE CHOSEN. TO BE VIOLENT PEOPLE. AND IT'S JUST COMPLETELY HURTFUL. AND IT SHOULD BE DEALT WITH IN A MATTER THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM MY OPINION I I DO BELIEVE. THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT THING TO US AND THE MESSAGE IT IS JUST. NOT ACCEPTABLE THANKS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. YOU MAY CLOSE MISS RODRIGUEZ. WITHOUT HER SHORTLY AFTER I WROTE THANK YOU THANK YOU END UP I WOULD I'M VOTING YESTERDAY AND I WOULD MAKE A SUGGESTION. THAT THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND THE OTHER. NURSES OF YOU IN EVERY WAY THAT WAS FOR THIS BILL. TAKE TO HEART. WHAT THE OPPONENT SAID ABOUT TECHNIQUES TO DE ESCALATE? A LOT OF THIS-- OBVIOUSLY WHEN A BIG PRPONENT OF THE ESCALATION -- AND IT SOUND LIKE -- SOME GOOD TECHNIQUES SO THAT MAYBE WORK ON TWO FRONTS. TECHNIQUES AND LEARNING HOW TO DO IT TO SEE IF SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN WE CAN WE CAN TRAIN. THE PROFESSIONALS TO TO MAKE SURE NOT IN THOSE KINDS OF SITUATION AND MAYBE USE SOME OF THOSE TECHNIQUES. AND ALONG WITH THIS LAW MAYBE WE CAN REDUCE IT. DOWN TO A METRIC NEGLIGIBLE -- NUMBER SO.

ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS I WANT YES SELECT. YEAH. UNDER THE PERPLEXED. ALTHOUGH. THE PREMISE TO YOUR BILL IS. CLEARLY VERY SUPPORTABLE. BUT WHAT I FIND TO BE. PERPLEXING IS THE FACT THAT YOU'RE BASICALLY HIJACKING THE SOCIAL INNOVATION. FINANCING PROGRAM. IF IF MY NUMBERS ARE CORRECT -- JUST RECENTLY. LA COUNTY FROM THAT PARTICULAR GRANT RECEIVED. TWO MILLION DOLLARS. AND THIS BILL THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING WOULD REDUCE THE ELIGIBILITY TELLING COUNTY. TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND LA COUNTY IS NOT. AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION.

ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISSILE LACKEY -- WE DECIDED TO USE THIS PROGRAM STRUCTURE FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE THE CURRENT -- CURRENTLY THERE'S NO FINDING ALL THE MONEY'S BEEN SPENT -- ASSOCIATED WITH A THREE COUNTY SO THAT'S THE REASON WHY.

B. -- FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO MY VOICE A LITTLE RASPY TRYING TO GET OVER A LITTLE FLU -- AB FOR A FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO SIX TO MAKE IT A HATE CRIME TO COMMIT A CRIMINAL ACT. IN WHOLE OR IN PART. BECAUSE OF THE VICTIM'S ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED HOMELESS STATUS. THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO CURB THEY HATE CRIMES AGAINST HOMELESS. WHO ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION? OF ANY. GROUP IN OUR SOCIETY. NATION WIDE BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AT LEAST ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS WERE VIOLENTLY ATTACKED. IN MANY CASES BECAUSE THEIR HOMELESS STATUS ACCORDING TO THE REPORT BY THE NATIONAL COALITION FOR THE HOMELESS. THESE ACTS WERE LARGELY FUELED BY -- HATEFUL IMPULSE TO AX. TOWARDS THE HOMELESS. FOR THRILLS. THE GIGGLES. FOR OTHERS ENJOYMENT. AND BECAUSE IT IS KNOWN THAT THE LACK OF PHYSICAL STRENGTH. AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. TO PROTECT THE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. NGUYEN ARGUING THAT HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS DON'T DESERVE HEIGHTENED LEGAL PROTECTION MANY OBSERVE THAT HOUSING STATUS IS CHANGEABLE [inaudible] WHEREAS RACE [inaudible] DISABILITY. STATUS ARE NOT. THIS IS CERTAINLY THE TRUTH. BE THAT BEAT BECAUSE THE RELIGIOUS IDENTITY. IS STABLE. BUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY INFLEXIBLE. AN INDIVIDUAL'S RELIGIOUS ASSOCIATION. CAN CHANGE SEVERAL TIMES IN ONE'S LIFETIME. THE TRUTH IS THAT WHEN MOST AMERICANS THINK ABOUT HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IT IS WITH MIXTURE. OF DISCUSS [inaudible] PITY [inaudible] AND FEAR. WE ALL BACK OUR COMPASSION BECAUSE WE CAN NOT. WE CAN'T WE CANNOT FATHOM THE DEPTH [inaudible] OTHER MISSOURI [inaudible] HARDSHIP [inaudible] OR SUFFERING. WE MOVE OURSELVES FROM THE SAME LEVEL OF EMPATHY. THAT OF PORTS TO OUR COLLEAGUES AND FAMILY MEMBERS. WE BECOME COMPLACENT. NATIONWIDE THE NUMBER OF ATTACKS AGAINST THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESS HAS INCREASED BUT CRIMES AGAINST HOMELESS ARE REPORTED AT LOW RATES IN COMPARISON TO OTHER CRIMES. FATAL ASSAULTS AGAINST PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OUTNUMBER HATE CRIMES AGAINST ALL PROTECTED [inaudible] CLASSES COMBINE. LET ME REPEAT THAT. FATAL ASSAULTS AGAINST PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OUT NUMBER HATE CRIMES AGAINST ALL PROTECTED CLASS THIS COMBINED. OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS MORE DEATHS HAVE OCCURRED FROM ATTACKS ON HOMELESS. THEN OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF HATE CRIMES OR THE BASIS OF RACE RELIGION [inaudible] SEXUAL ORIENTATION. ASK YOURSELF THIS QUESTION. NOT JUST YOU BUT PEOPLE IN THIS OUT OF MY VOICE. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE A LOVED? ONE A FAMILY MEMBER AN EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBER. A FRIEND OUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR OR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS CHILDREN WHO HAVE GROWN UP AND BY THEMSELVES HOMELESS ON THE STREETS. WOULD YOU CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM AND THEIR SAFETY. LET ME PAUSE THERE FOR A MOMENT. I FOR ONE JUST RECEIVED A TEXT MESSAGE FROM MY GOD SON. WHO IS HOMELESS? HAVE SOME SUBSTANCE ABUSE AT THE SAME TIME. NEVER GOT TREATED FROM THE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE OF LOSING BOTH PARENTS AT SIX YEARS OLD TO AIDS. AND NOW WAS HOMELESS AND HE'S REACHED OUT TO HIS GODFATHER NOW BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE HOMELESS ANY LONGER. I CARE ABOUT HIS SAFETY. AS A BODY TAKEN. AS A BODY. MAKING JUST LOS. WHAT ARE WE REALLY DOING IF WE CONTINUE TO OVERLOOK? OUR STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR. HOMELESS MAN AND WOMAN. WAS SLEEPING ON THE STREETS AND WERE ATTACKED. THROWN BATTERY ACID AS THEY SLEPT IN MISSION HILLS PARK. THANK GOD THEY SURVIVED. IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR. A SUSPECT WEARING A DARK SUIT WITH THE BEANIE WAS CAPTURED ON VIDEOTAPE AND HOMELESS KICKING A HOMELESS MAN. AS HE SLEPT ON THE STREET THE SAN FRANCISCO. THAT BIG DEAL WAS FOUND. IN HIS OWN BLOOD. AND WAS RUSHED TO SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL THANK GOD HE SURVIVED. IN OTHER CASES LAST YEAR TWO HOMELESS MEN WERE SLEEPING IN THE LOS ANGELES FINANCIAL DISTRICT. WHERE THEY WERE PETE AT LEE BEATEN WITH A BASEBALL BAT? THOSE INDIVIDUALS BOTH DIED. OF THEIR INJURIES. SO WE NOT MAKE LAWS TO ANSWER THE PROBLEMS IN OUR SOCIETY TODAY OR ARE WE WORKING BACKWARDS TO RESTRAIN OUR AUTHORITY. TO MAKING A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE SIMILAR [inaudible] SIMPLE. NOW PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS. THOSE WHO ARE VULNERABLE. THOSE CANNOT DEFEND THEMSELVES. LET ME SHOW YOU THE EXAMPLE PROGRESS. THE FIRST STATE. OF HATE CRIMES. BILLS WERE PASSED CALIFORNIA IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND PROVIDED A PENALTY ENHANCEMENT IN CASES WHERE MURDER WAS MOTIVATED BY PREJUDICE AGAINST PROTECTED STATUS. THE CATEGORIES BEING RACE RELIGION COLOR AND NATURAL ORIGIN. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR CALIFORNIA LED THE WAY AND INCLUDED SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND HATE CRIMES STATUS. WE AGAIN DID THIS WITH GENDER IDENTITY IN. NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT CURRENT HATE CRIME LAWS NOW ALSO INCLUDES. A DISABILITY GENDER AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION. AND WE MAKE MATTERS WORSE. ACCORDING TO THE OFFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S THIS PROBLEM IS GREATER IN CALIFORNIA THE ANY OTHER STATE [inaudible] IN AMERICA. BUT ALAS GO. FLORIDA MARYLAND UTAH AS WELL AS WASHINGTON DC HAVE ALSO PASSED TO EXPAND HOUSING. THE HOMELESS AS A STATUS. WITH ME TODAY ARE INDIVIDUALS BLUE IN WASHINGTON DC WHO SPOKE BEFORE CONGRESS ON THIS MATTER REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL COALITION FOR HOMELESS. I WILL HAVE THEM TO ALSO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO AS A STILL PRODUCE RIGHT YOU% HAVE FIVE MINUTES TOTAL WHATEVER WAY YOU WANT TO SPLIT IT UP. AND I AND I SEE MISTER GIBSON YOU BUNCH OF VOICE [inaudible] YEAH YEAH. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU CHAIR PERSONS JONES SAWYER AND THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY -- I AM ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY CITED CRIMINOLOGIST WITH RESPECT TO HATE CRIMES AND I CAN TELL YOU WE HAVE. JUST ABOUT. WILL YOU COMMITTEE WITHIN THE CRIMINOLOGIST COMMUNITY THE STUDY IS THE PEOPLE WHO THE MOST WIDELY CITED. ARM AND THAT IS BECAUSE LET'S KEEP OUR EYE ON THE BALL WITH RESPECT TO TWO THINGS. FIRST AND BY THE WAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M REPRESENTING THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM THE NATIONAL COALITION FOR THE HOMELESS AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION. OF HUMAN RELATIONS ORGANIZATIONS -- IN SUPPORT OF AB. FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO LET'S KEEP OUR EYES ON THE BALL HERE. HE CRIME LEGISLATION WHEN IT FIRST CAME ABOUT FIRST ACT WAS IN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE IN MASSACHUSETTS. JAMIE OVER TIME EXPAND. WHEN I WROTE A COUPLE OF BREACHING THE LANDMARK SUPREME COURT CASE WHICH CONTROVERSIES MITCHELL WHICH COVERED? HATE CRIME THE QUESTION CAME UP. HOW FAR DOES THIS GO? AND THE JUSTICES ALL WITH REGARD TO THE ORAL ORGAN SAID YOU KNOW. WHAT EVER LEGISLATURE'S FINE THAT THERE IS TARGET BORN WHAT ABOUT FLATTER AUTHORS IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH REGARD TO PREJUDICE RELATE TO THAT? THEN LET'S DO IT WHAT WE HAVE HERE LET'S KEEP OUR EYE ON THE BALL HERE [inaudible] IS. A PERNICIOUS TYPE OF PREJUDICE IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE VULNERABLE INDEED ANY CRIME THAT THEM WITH THE REGIONAL WALKING TO SCHOOL ON A WEEKEND. OR WHETHER IT'S AN AFRICAN AMERICAN. WHO IS NOT FORMED IN A CHURCH IN SOUTH CAROLINA? OR VULNERABLE BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY ARE. BUT WE ALSO HAVE. A DISTURBING ISSUE WITH REGARD TO YOU YOUNG PEOPLE AND OTHERS WHO HARD HOMELESS DOWN. AND WE SEE THAT THE OFFENDERS OR THE EXACT SAME TYPE TWENTY INTRODUCED **** SKINHEADS THEY SEE IF I CAN FIND AN AFRICAN AMERICAN PERSON IF I CAN FIND A GAY PERSON ALL TO STOP A HOMELESS PERSON BECAUSE THEIR FILTH. MORE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT I WANT TO BE CAREFUL HERE WE FOUND FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX CASES. WERE HOMELESS PEOPLE WERE MURDERED WHEN THERE WASN'T AN APPARENT MOTIVE SUCH A DRUG DEAL GONE BAD PERSONAL DISPUTE PECUNIARY GAIN BY DOMICILED PEOPLE. THEY REPRESENT THEY REPRESENT THE MOST CRUELLY VICTIMIZED AND JUST YESTERDAY THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION CAME OUT WITH RESEARCH THAT SHOWED THAT IN FOUR YEARS. THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY HOMELESS PEOPLE MURDERED IN LA. THAT IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF VICTIMIZATION AND YES THE OR DRIVEN BY PREJUDICE. CLASS PLEASE PRAY JUST SOMETIMES IS AN INTERSECTION ONLY WITH RACE OR OR OTHER THINGS BUT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO ARE GAY WHO FACE MEDICAL BILLS OR OTHER THINGS WHICH LEAD THEM TO BE HOMELESS. I WOULD LIKE TO NOW YIELD THE REST OF THE TIME TO BOB IRWIN BUSH WHO IS REALLY AN ANGEL AMONG US WITH REGARD TO BEING ON THE STREETS HELPING OUT. HOMELESS PEOPLE. THANK YOU THANK YOU BRIAN BARBARA BUSH I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SACRAMENTO REGIONAL COALITION AND HOMELESSNESS AND I AM ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE NATIONAL COALITION -- FOR IN DC THE THIS IS MY THIRTY FIFTH YEAR OF WORKING -- AS A HOMELESS ADVOCATE I GAVE YOU A HAND OUT A COUPLE OF POINTS VERY QUICKLY NATIONALLY AS WAS REFERRED TO THE NATIONAL COALITION. HAS DOCUMENTED THAT FROM HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX ACTS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST HOMELESS PEOPLE HUNDRED WERE LETHAL [inaudible] WERE LETHAL. HATE CRIMES COMPARED AGAINST HOMELESS PEOPLE COMPARED TO THAT FBI DEFINITION OF HATE CRIMES. ALMOST THREE TIMES HIGHER. OVER SIXTEEN YEARS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE HATE CRIMES AS DEFINED BY THE F. D. I. F. B. I.. BUT FATAL ATTACKS ON HOMELESS PEOPLE IT'S FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT THREE TIMES HIGHER. IN CALIFORNIA THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR ACTS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST -- PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR 20% OF THE NATIONAL ATTACKS AGAINST PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND IN SACRAMENTO. MY COALITION WE DO A HOMELESS DOES REPORT EVERY YEAR AND YOU HAVE THE STATISTICS IN FRONT OF YOU. OVER SEVENTEEN YEAR PERIOD TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN OF THE NINE HUNDRED DEATHS JUST IN OUR COUNTY. WERE VIOLENT DEATHS BLUNT FORCE HEAD INJURIES HOMICIDES GUNSHOT WOUNDS DRAMA. STABBINGS HANGINGS AND STRANGULATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BRUTAL DEATHS PEOPLE BEING SET ON FIRE. BATTERY ACID POURED ON THEM BEAT OF OVER THE HEAD WITH A BASEBALL BAT EXCEPT ERIC CETERA. AND IN CLOSING. I ASKED THE SACRAMENTO A DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH TO DO APPLES TO APPLES. THE HOMELESS DEATHS IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY PER HUNDRED THOUSAND HOW DOES THAT EQUATE TO THE HOUSE OF DEATH. IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY. SIX PEOPLE DIE PER HUNDRED THOUSAND THE HOUSE COMMUNITY IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT HOMELESS PEOPLE PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY. MANY OF THEM HATE CRIMES. IN OTHER WORDS TWENTY FOUR TIMES HIGHER. IF YOU WERE SITTING HERE TODAY AND ANY OTHER GROUP CAME BEFORE YOU. CAME BEFORE YOU AND WAS TWENTY FOUR TIMES HIGHER HIGHER I WOULD NOT BE SITTING HERE BECAUSE YOU WOULD PASS THIS IN A HEART BEAT. AB. FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO ISN'T IT SHOULD BE PASSED AGAINST. FOR IT TO SUPPORT PEOPLE -- EXPERIENCING HOMELESS DOES AS A PROTECTED CLASS NOT ONLY IN THE STATE BUT IN THIS COUNTRY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU SIR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NAME AN ORGANIZATION PLEASE. HELP STEP UP TO THE MIKE NAME AN ORGANIZATION RYAN BRACK ANNE I BUT HOMELESS EIGHTY ONE TO EIGHTY TWO BECAUSE I AND LIVE ON A FIXED INCOME I'M. PERCEIVED AS HOMELESS AND TO HAVE. FACED HARASSMENT I WOULD ALSO LIKE. TO THANK YOU SIR -- CARES WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. COME THE DESK. COULD YOU PLEASE MAKE A LITTLE ROOM FOR SO YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES SURE. THIS JEFF ROSEN I'M THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY -- THE HOMELESS ARE VULNERABLE VICTIMS BUT NOT HATE CRIME VICTIMS WE MUST BE STEADFAST IMPRECISE AS WE APPLY THE LAW IN ORDER TO BRING VULNERABLE CLASSES. OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS UNDER OUR PROTECTIONS AGAINST CRIMES OF HATE. IS A TRAGICALLY BUT PAINSTAKINGLY CHOSEN LAST THAT IN A BETTER WORLD NO ONE WOULD HAVE TO BELONG. TO THUS I RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT MY OPPOSITION TO A. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO AS IT IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN WHICH HAD TO HOMELESS STATUS TO THE LIST OF CATEGORIES. PROTECTOR CALIFORNIA'S HATE CRIME LAW LISTS ARE CLEARLY VULNERABLE AS VICTIMS OF ALL TYPES OF CRIME -- SADLY MOST OF THE PERPETRATORS IN MY EXPERIENCE OF WHO COMMIT CRIMES AGAINST HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE THEMSELVES HOMELESS. I STAND WITH YOU IN MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE PROPER POWER OF LAW TO BRING WHEN A HOMELESS PERSON HAS BEEN ATTACKED. HOWEVER I BELIEVE THAT THE HATE CRIME LAWS NOT THE APPROPRIATE VESSEL FOR THAT CRIME FOR PHILOSOPHICAL AND PRACTICAL REASONS I BELIEVE IT IS WHAT MAKES MORE SENSE TO ADD HOMELESSNESS. TO PENAL CODE SECTION SIX SIX SEVEN POINT NINE THE VULNERABLE VICTIM STATUTE AS OPPOSED TO SECTION FOUR TWENTY TWO POINT. FIVE FIVE HATE CRIME LAWS ARE DESIGNED TO ENHANCE PENALTIES FOR CRIMES COMMITTED BECAUSE OF THE VICTIMS FUNDAMENTAL PERSONAL CHARACTERISTIC. FOR INSTANCE RACE GENDER NATIONALITY DISABILITY SEXUAL ORIENTATION THESE ARE CORE PERSONAL TRAITS WHICH AN INDIVIDUAL EITHER CANNOT OR SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR HEIGHT TO BE FREE FROM TARGETED IN VIOLENT BIGOTRY. THE POWER OF THEIR STATUS AS PROTECTED CLASSES LIES WITHIN THEIR INTRINSIC NATURE. HOMELESSNESS MY CONTRACT IS NOT SUCH A STATUS IS A FLUID SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS THAT EVERYONE OF US SHOULD ASPIRE TO CHANGE FOR THE BETTER. TO ADD SUCH A CLASS WOULD WEAKEN THE OTHERS MAKING IT EVEN HARDER TO MEET THE HIGH BURDEN OF PROOF REQUIRED BY THE LAW. EVEN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE BRAVEST AND FINEST DESPITE THEIR VULNERABILITY DO NOT FALL UNDER THE HATE CRIME LAWS MODEST BUT CAREFULLY CRAFTED EAVES. PREVIOUSLY I OPPOSE THE WELL INTENTIONED BUT MISGUIDED EFFORTS TO ADD LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO THE HATE CRIME LAW. AS A MORE SENSIBLE ALTERNATIVE I ASK LAWMAKERS TO CONSIDER ADDING HOMELESSNESS TO PENAL CODE SECTION SIX SIX SEVEN POINT NINE CALIFORNIA'S VULNERABLE VICTIM STATUTE WHICH REQUIRES ONLY THAT THE PERPETRATOR KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE EXISTENCE. OF N ENUMERATED CONDITION OF THE VICTIM [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH EXCUSE ME ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK I NEED MUCH TIME I'M GOING TO GO MUCH OF WHAT THE DA -- FROM SANTA CLARA COUNTY JUST SAID MY NAME'S NANCY AT PELHAM WITH THE ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE AND HONOR OF TESTIFYING BEFORE THIS. COURT [inaudible] I'LL CONTINUE. ON MATTERS OF OF HATE CRIME AND ADL ACTUALLY DRAFTED THE MODEL HATE CRIMES STATUTE OF WAY WAY WAY BACK AND IT HAS BEEN A CORE. ISSUE FOR US AS WELL AT IF THEY WANT [inaudible] YEAH. WE AGREED THAT HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS ARE IN NEED OF HEIGHTENED PROTECTIONS IN THE LAW THEY ARE QUITE VULNERABLE TO CRIMES OF ALL SORTS. THE HATE CRIME STATUTE -- DESPITE ITS NAME -- WAS WAS CONCEIVED OF AND HAS BEEN THE REASON WHY IT'S STILL HAS INTEGRITY AND IT HAS BEEN ABLE TO WITHSTAND. A CONTINUED SPEECHES AND POLITICAL ATTACKS ON THE NEED FOR HATE CRIME LAW IS BECAUSE OF THE INTEGRITY IT IS MEANT. TO COVER THOSE CHARACTERISTICS WHICH AGAIN OUR CORE AN INTRINSIC TO AN INDIVIDUAL WHO EITHER CANNOT OR SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CHANGE IT -- THE CURRENT CATEGORIES ALL FALL IN THAT THE CURRENT SIX CATEGORIES IN CALIFORNIA'S LAW. DESPITE THE VULNERABILITY -- TO CRIMES OF ALL SORTS THAT ARE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS I HAVE AND WHICH IS CITED MULTIPLE TIMES AS THE REASON. FOR THIS THIS BILL -- BY THE AUTHOR THE VULNERABLE VICTIM STATUTE -- WE FEEL IT IS MORE APPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S ANALOGOUS -- TO EIGHTY TWO WHICH WAS ANOTHER BILL THAT. WE OPPOSE ALSO THAT WOULD HAVE ADDED PEACE OFFICERS TO THE HATE CRIME STATUTE THERE ARE THOSE WHO TARGET PEACE PEACE OFFICERS FOR VIOLENCE. AND WE RIGHTLY CONDEMNED THAT BUT IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE TO PUT A PROFESSION I INTO EVEN EVEN THAT TYPE OF PROFESSION INTO THE HATE CRIMES STATUTE THERE ARE OTHER STATUTES WHERE IT IS MORE APPROPRIATE AND WE PUT TO YOU IS THE SAME THING HERE. THANK YOU [inaudible] YES. MARCO GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION WE OPPOSE THIS BILL BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS I HAD WITH THE MEMBER STAFF ABOUT THE BILL. AND THE INTENTIONS BEHIND IT -- CERTAINLY -- AS PUBLIC DEFENDERS WERE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE PLIGHT OF THE HOMELESS MANY OF THEM ARE THEIR CLIENTS. ON ALSO MY FATHER WAS HOMELESS AS A TEENAGER AND THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION. AND ALTHOUGH PEOPLE WERE NOT REVILED AT THAT TIME BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE WERE HOMELESS. WE BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY THAT THIS RESOURCES. THAT WOULD TAKE TO INCARCERATE MORE PEOPLE UNDER THIS BILL WOULD BE BETTER SPENT TO PROVIDE SERVICES. FOR HOUSING MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT DRUG AND EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS FOR THE HOMELESS INSTEAD OF LONGER PRISON SENTENCES. JUST THIS MORNING MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THE STORY ON THE CALIFORNIA REPORT ABOUT THE PARK RANGERS AND SACRAMENTO TICKETING THE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS. ALONG THE RIVER. THIS IS THE SITUATION. THIS BILL WILL NOT CHANGE THAT. I AGREE WITH KEEPING THE INTEGRITY OF THE HATE STE -- STATUTES THAT EXIST I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD INCLUDE ON PUT THIS AND SOME OTHER STATUTE SO THANK YOU AND THAT WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES MITCHELL LACKEY. YES CERTAINLY I'M. I'M ALWAYS AN ADVOCATE. FOR VICTIMS OF A CRIMINALITY. AND I THINK THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY -- EXPRESSED IT PROBABLY IT PROBABLY THE BEST. BY INDICATING THAT THERE IS ANOTHER PATH THAT WE CAN RECOGNIZE THIS THIS UNISEX. AGAINST THESE VERY VULNERABLE PEOPLE THEY ARE. UNIQUELY VULNERABLE. AND I THINK AT IN THEM TO THE SIX SIX SEVEN POINT NINE OF THE PENAL CODE. IS THE BETTER PATHWAY BECAUSE ABILITY IS A CRITICAL ASPECT OF HATE CRIME. AND I KNOW YOU USED THE THE EXAMPLE OF RELIGION [inaudible] BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RELIGION AND HOMELESSNESS THIS IS NOT A GOAL. TO MOVE SOMEBODY FROM RELIGIOUS TO NON RELIGIOUS IT IS OUR GOAL TO REMOVE SOMEBODY FROM HOMELESSNESS. TO NON HOMELESSNESS AND THAT IS AN IMMUTABILITY ARGUMENT THAT I THINK IS VERY POWERFUL SO FOR THAT REASON. I I NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS PATHWAY AT THIS TIME ANYONE ELSE. KAMLAGER-DOVE. YEAH I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING -- THIS BILL TO THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION I WOMEN GENERALLY I'M NOT ON THE SAME SIDE AS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S SO -- IN MY EXPERIENCE ACTUALLY -- BEING ABLE TO PROSECUTE SOMEONE FOR HATE CRIME IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO THE THRESHOLD. AND THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS SO HIGH AND WHEN FOLKS ARE COMMITTING SUCH HEINOUS CRIMES AS I'M SORRY ATTACKING OR KILLING SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY'RE POOR. ESSENTIALLY ARE BECAUSE THEY'RE HOMELESS THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER TOOLS AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE PENAL CODE WHERE YOU CAN GO AFTER THEM I WOULD CERTAINLY NOT ACTUALLY WANT TO MOVE SOMEONE INTO A GROUP WHERE IT THEN BECOMES INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE IN CHARGE. AND HOLD PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ACTS -- WE'VE JUST SEEN IN THE NEWS LET ALONE THE DATA. THAT -- THAT JUST TALKS ABOUT HOW CHALLENGING IT IS TO DO THAT SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE A RESPONSE TO SOME OF THAT BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN THE DATA -- MY WITNESSES IN MY WINTERS CAN COME BACK UP OF SOMEONE TO MOVE FROM HERE SO MODES SURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] BOB [inaudible] RIGHT. MAY I DRESS SOME OF THE FIRST OF ALL YOU WOULD GIVE YOU. AND I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HAVE READ BY MY LOOK AT US FROM STANFORD JOHN HART ELY ROAD A FOOTNOTE FOR CAROLINE AND ALSO ABOUT THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT. THESE WERE LEFT EXPANSIVE FOR A REASON AND THE ISSUE HERE. KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BALL HERE THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR WHEN THE NEW YORK TIMES WRITING ABOUT IT SAID IT WAS NOT ONLY SOMETHING. THAT WAS GOING TO BE AN ENFORCEABLE. METRIC BUT ALSO WAS A MORAL METRIC. AND WHEN WE HAVE PREJUDICE WE HAVE THE SAME TYPES OF OFFENDERS FOR REAL OFFENDERS WHO DO IT FOR EXCITEMENT. DEFENSIVE REACTIVE OFFENDERS WERE PROTECTING TURF TO THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AND NEO **** SKINHEADS LIKE THE ONE WHO MURDERED A HOMELESS BLACK MAN PRETTY RENTON ON HITLER'S BIRTHDAY. SO IF WE'RE GOING TO SAY IT MIGHT NOT BE AS EFFICIENT AS PEOPLE LIKE THAT I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FACT. THAT WE HAVE A VARIETY OF GROUPS WERE COVERED AND MANY EDL FIRST CAME OUT WITH THEIR MODEL LEGISLATION BACK IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE IT DIDN'T COVER MANY OF THE GROUPS INDEED IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THIS WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TYPES OF HOMICIDE WE'RE SEEING. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOSE THAT ARE MOTIVATED BY NEGATIVE STEREOTYPES BASED ON PREJUDICE NO ONE HAS COME UP WITH A NEW CONVOLUTED THING. WHEN I WAS IN LAW SCHOOL I ACTUALLY REPRESENTED THE SANTA CLARA DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND HELP THEM WIN A VICTORY WITH REGARD TO HOMELESS DEFINITION THE STATE? AND I AND I'VE CRAFTED THESE THESE LEGISLATION. HELP CRAPPIE LEGISLATION THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THE BOTTOM LINE IS DO WE HAVE A PROBLEM TARGET VIOLENCE IS IT AGAINST THE COMMUNITY THAT IS NOT GETTING THE KIND OF SERVICES FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT PREVIOUS AND WE SEE THAT WITH A LOT OF HATE CRIME. AND IS IT MOTIVATED BY PREJUDICE AND WHEN WE HAVE THE **** FIGHTS VIDEOS AND PEOPLE FILMING THIS STUFF. AND THE KIND OF DERISION ABOUT HOMELESS PEOPLE BEING FILLED. THAT IS THE PREJUDICE THAT IS DRIVING THIS IT'S NOT THE VULNERABILITY WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE BEATING THE DAYLIGHTS OUT OF CAMPERS. WE HAD PEOPLE BEATING THE DAYLIGHTS OUT OF THESE PEOPLE AND JUST TO PARAPHRASE. ST TERESA. THEY VERY WELL MAY BE JESUS IN THE SKIES IN A FIRE -- WHAT GROUP IS MORE OF IS NOT IS MORE VULNERABLE THAN THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS? THIS IS A A BARBEL POPULATION THAT EXISTS. THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS FOR WHATEVER REASON WHETHER IT'S MENTAL ILLNESS WEATHER'S DRUGS. CAN'T FIND A JOB. OR WHATEVER THEY DESERVE TO BE PROTECTED. IN THIS STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO JUST QUOTE. A FORMER AMERICAN BAPTIST PREACHER. A CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER BENJAMIN ELIJAH MAYS. WHO PAVE THE WAY FOR THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT [inaudible] IN AMERICA. AND I QUOTE THE TRAGEDY OF LIFE. IS OFTEN NOT. IN OUR FAILURE [inaudible] BUT RATHER. THE OUR COMPLACENCY. NOT IN DOING TOO MUCH BUT RATHER. DOING TOO LITTLE. NOT IN OUR LIVING ABOVE OUR ABILITIES BUT RATHER IN LIVING. BELOW OUR CAPACITY. HATE CRIMES ARE EXPRESSLY DISGUSTING. BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS ARE SINGLING OUT THESE INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE HOMELESS? THEY DIDN'T CHOOSE TO BE HOMELESS. PEOPLE ARE NOT SIMPLY. LAYING ON THE STREETS JUST BECAUSE THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE NOWHERE TO GO. THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN PEED ON RAPED [inaudible] BEACHWOOD BACKS. PORT BATTERY ACID ON THEM. LEFT FOR DEAD AND IN MOST CASES THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE DIED FROM INJURIES. I REALIZE THAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO SENTENCE ENHANCEMENT. WHAT AT WHAT POINT WILL WE DO THAT IN THE STATE? IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT CALIFORNIA LED THE WAY WAS THE MODEL. FOR OTHER STATES IN AMERICA [inaudible] TO RECOGNIZE. BEING BLACK. JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE TARGETING IN THE BILL BECAUSE THEY'RE BLACK OR GAY. OR HAVE A DISABILITY. SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. IN AMERICA SHOULD NOT HAPPEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS? THOSE INDIVIDUALS DESERVE THE SAME KIND OF PROTECTIONS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE LED THE WAY. AND I'VE JUST DESCRIBED OTHER STATES WERE ALREADY LEADING THE WAY IN THIS SPACE [inaudible] AGAIN. WHO WILL STAND UP OF THOSE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITY I'M ASKING YOU TODAY? I KNOW THIS IS WOULD BE A UP HE'LL FIGHT BUT I STILL TOOK THIS FIGHT ON AND WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE THIS FIGHT ON NO MATTER WHAT THE OUTCOME WILL BE TODAY. I WILL BE BACK. WITH THE SAME VIGOR IN THE SAME FIGHT. BUT I PEELED EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU. SO PLEASE SEARCH YOUR HEART. REGARDING THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY DESERVE PROTECTION I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER GIBSON -- I WILL APPLAUD YOU -- YOU HAVE MANAGED TO GET BOTH THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND THE DA ON THE SAME PAGE ALONG WITH. OF CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE SAME THING. NO ONE HERE. IS SAYING THAT THERE IS THERE IS THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH THE HOMES HERE -- INSANE HERE THAT THERE AREN'T SOME HEINOUS THINGS DONE THE HOMES AND NO ONE HEARS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT. BE PROTECTED. THE DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW IS WHETHER NOT THEY GO INTO JUST. ONE CATEGORY. AND THE OPPOSITION HAS GIVEN YOU. A VEHICLE. BOB VEHICLE TO MOVE IT INTO JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE IN A PORTION STEP A MERCEDES. THEY'VE GIVEN YOU A VEHICLE IN WHICH YOU CAN MOVE THIS ALONG AND PROVIDE. PROTECTIONS TO THIS GROUP THAT WE CAN THEN MOVE FORWARD AND HOPEFULLY WHAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THE TO MOVE WILL. FOR I WAS HERE WHEN WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION. ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO WERE TARGETED I THINK AT THAT TIME WE HAD THE UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT OF FIVE OFFICERS GETTING KILLED IN DALLAS. THAT WERE TARGETED -- IN ONE OF THE MOST COWARDLY HEINOUS THINGS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR THIS COMMITTEE. BECAUSE OF IT BEING A HATE CRIME QUEST TO SAY NOT WITH VERY DIFFICULT. FOR US TO SAY SAY NO BECAUSE THERE. THIS WHOLE CONCEPT OF AS WHEN YOU'RE WITNESSES SAID. AN AFRICAN AMERICAN HOMELESS PERSON. IT IS A HATE CRIME. BECAUSE HE'S AFRICAN AMERICAN. AND HE CAN'T CHANGE THAT. AND SO THAT'S THE WHOLE CONCEPT IF WE START GOING DOWN THE ROAD. OF SINGLING OUT. DIFFERENT GROUPS AND AND BY PROFESSION IT BECOMES REALLY PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE THAT THAT LIST ONE COULD BE VERY. VERY LARGE BUT ALSO -- DID THE CONCEPT THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN CHANGE THAT. ARE YOU MADE A CONSCIOUS CHOICE AS SOMEONE SAID. TO WHERE THE RELIGIOUS WITH PROFESSIONAL WHETHER IT'S WHAT WHATEVER -- VIEW YOU CAN'T CHANGE. THE AFRICAN AMERICAN WHAT RACE YOU ARE AND AND THE REASON THAT WE'VE ADDED. SEXUAL PREFERENCE BECAUSE WE NOW HAVE NOW ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT IS NOT A CHOICE IT IS. SOMETHING THAT'S INHERENTLY IN SOMEONE. AND SO UNFORTUNATELY I'M GOING TO RECOMMEND A NO. AND I WANT YOU TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT BUT I WANT YOU TO GET IN THE RIGHT VEHICLE SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT DIPONIBLE CLASS IS ULTIMATELY PROTECTED. SO CHAIRED RECOMMENDED.

TWENTY SEVEN BILL NUMBERS NINE TWO EIGHT AND TWELVE EIGHTY WHICHEVER ONE YOU WANT TO DO FIRST. TWELVE A PLEASE. SO THIS IS AB. TWELVE EIGHTY MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW ME TO PRESENT. ON AB ONE TWELVE EIGHTY RELATING TO DEFLATE VIDEOS. BEFORE I GO INTO DETAILS ON THE BILL. I WOULD LIKE TO STATE CLEARLY THAT I WILL BE STRIKING PARAGRAPH SEE. RELATED TO ELECTIONS. WELL I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT DEEP MAKES HAVE A VERY REAL ABILITY TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTIONS. A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS -- RAISE CONCERNS WITH THIS PROVISION AND I THINK MALICIOUS PORNOGRAPHIC DEEP FAKES AND DEPICTS INTENDED TO INTERFERE WITH ELECTIONS SHOULD BE DISCUSSED AND CONSIDERED SEPARATELY. THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR A CLEARER MORE DIRECT CONSIDERATION OF EACH CONCERNED. THE TERM DEEP FAKE FIRST COINED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN REFERS TO FORCED OR FATE VIDEOS CREATED VIA MACHINE LEARNING WHERE A PERSON'S LIKENESS INCLUDING THEIR FACE AND VOICE. CAN BE REALISTICALLY SWAPPED WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S. WHILE THE UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGY A FORM OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT DEEP BREAKS ARE BASED ON WAS FIRST DEVELOPED IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THIS SPECIFIC APPLICATION FIRST APPEARED IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN ON A REDDIT FORM. AND HAS SINCE EXPLODED IN USE. A NUMBER OF HIGH PROFILE DEEP FAKE VIDEOS HAVE INCLUDED PRESIDENT OBAMA. STEVE LUCEY ME AND JENNIFER LAWRENCE AND SCARLETT JOHANNSON IN THE CASE OF SCHOLARSHIP JOHANNSON THE VIDEO WAS PORTRAYED AS AN AUTHENTIC LEAKED SEXUALLY EXPLICIT VIDEO. THAT WAS VIEWED OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TIMES. IN MOST INSTANCES A TARGET IS IDENTIFIED ANY FACIAL PROFILE IS HARVESTED FROM EXISTING VIDEO LIKE MOVIES OR POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENTS. THE FOOTAGE IS THEN ANALYZED BY THE DEEP MAKE APPLICATION. AFTER THE TARGETS FACES BEEN SUFFICIENTLY ANALYZED THE APPLICATION THEN ANALYZES THE SOURCE VIDEO TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GRAPH THE TARGET SPACE ON TO THE ORIGINAL VIDEO. THE RESULTS ARE ASTOUNDING AND INCLUDE FULL REPRESENTATION OF FACIAL FEATURES GESTURES AND EVEN SPEECH. AS THE TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES LESS SOURCE MATERIAL WILL BE REQUIRED AND NOW BUT QUALITY WILL ALSO IMPROVE. AS SUCH THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY FOCUSES EXCLUSIVELY ON THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF MALICIOUS PORNOGRAPHIC DEEP FAKE VIDEOS. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN RECOGNIZING THE DANGER OF SEVERE MENTAL ANGUISH AND REPUTATIONAL HARM THAT CAN BE CAUSED BY SEXUALLY EXPLICIT CONTENT RELEASED ON THE INTERNET WITHOUT CONSENT. THE LEGISLATURE UNANIMOUSLY PASSED A PROHIBITION ON SO CALLED REVENGE PORN. AS AN ANALOG TO THE COMMENDABLE LEGISLATION THIS BILL RESPONSE TO A NEW WAY THAT TECHNOLOGY CAN BE HARNESSED TO INFLICT EMOTIONAL HARM OR DAMAGE ON A PERSON'S REPUTATION. NO LONGER DOES SOMEBODY HAVE TO ACTUALLY -- ACTUALLY BE FILMED IN A SEXUAL ACT NOW THERE ONLY NEEDS TO BE A SOURCE VIDEO AND A CONVINCING FAKE CAN BE GENERATED TO MAKE IT APPEAR. SOMEONE HAS PARTICIPATED IN A SEXUAL ACT. LET US BE CLEAR THAT REAL HARM WILL BE DONE AND THIS PROBLEM WILL BECOME WIDESPREAD ALREADY STATISTICS FROM RECENT CYBER ABUSE STUDIES SHOW. THEY SHOW US THAT ONE IN TWENTY FIVE AMERICANS ONLINE HAVE EITHER HAD SENSITIVE EMISSION IMAGES POSTED WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION OR HAD SOMEONE THREATEN TO POST PHOTOS OF THEM. THOSE STATISTICS ONLY GET WORSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUNG PEOPLE ONE IN FOURTEEN YOUNG WOMEN ONE IN TEN AND MEMBERS OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY ONE IN. SIX OF THESE VICTIMS A SICKENING THEY CONSIDERED SUICIDE WITH DEBATE TECHNOLOGY THIS PROBLEM WILL BECOME EVEN MORE PERVASIVE AS ACTUAL MATERIAL CONSIDERED. A SENSITIVE IS NO LONGER THAN REQUIRED. AS YOU CONSIDER A. B. TWELVE EIGHTY I IMPLORE YOU TO CONSIDER A FEW KEY POINTS WE KNOW THAT AS TECHNOLOGY CHANGES SO DO OUR LOSS. THIS BILL IS NARROWLY TAILORED TAILORED TO TARGET ONLY MALICIOUS PORNOGRAPHIC DEEP FAKES THAT ARE ACTUALLY DISTRIBUTED AND THAT ARE REASONABLE THAT ARE. THAT A REASONABLE PERSON CANNOT DIFFERENTIATE FROM REALITY THOUSANDS OF THESE VIDEOS ALREADY EXIST THAT ARE CAUSING SIGNIFICANT MENTAL ANGUISH AND REAL REPUTATIONAL HARM. WE HAVE ACTED TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS FROM SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR DANGER IN REVENGE PORN JUST SIX YEARS AGO AND LASTLY WE KNOW THIS PROBLEM IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE. IN ADDITION WE HAVE DEVELOPED A AND AND PLAN TO INCORPORATE LANGUAGE TO FURTHER REFINE AND TAYLOR THE DEFINITION OF DEEP BREAKS. AND DEEPLY CREATION SO THAT WE CAN ALL BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT THIS BILL ONLY TARGETS THE INTENTIONAL CREATION OF MALICIOUS PORNOGRAPHIC DEEP BREAKS. SO BECAUSE OF THESE PROMISED AMENDMENTS YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THIS LEGISLATION SHOULD YOU ALLOW IT TO PROCEED NOW. AND WE BELIEVE GIVEN THE URGENCY OF THE SITUATION AND THE CURRENT LEVEL OF RISK. THE PRUDENT COURSE IS TO CONSIDER THE LEGISLATION FULLY THIS YEAR. I BELIEVE THE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO TAKE THE LEAD ON THIS ISSUE WE MUST ACT BEFORE MALICIOUS PORNOGRAPHIC DEPICTS BECOME A COMMON OCCURRENCE IN OUR SCHOOLS HOMES. AND WORKPLACES THREATENING EVEN MORE OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE FRIENDS AND YES OUR FAMILIES. I AM COMMITTED TO CAN TURN CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS. AND WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE OR HAVE MIGHT WITNESS SELF INTRODUCE. HELLO FIRST THANK YOU DETERMINE JONES SAWYER VICE CHAIRMAN LACKEY AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION OF AB. TWELVE EIGHTY MY NAME IS MARK BERGMANN I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY. WE ARE CONSUMER PROTECTION ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON SOCIAL MEDIA PROTECTING AGAINST ALL SOCIAL MEDIA RELATED DANGERS INCLUDING SIDE REVELING HARASSMENT AND PROPAGANDA. WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR AB TWELVE EIGHTY WHICH RESPONSE TO THE NEW AND FRIGHTENING DANGER CREATED BY DEEP FAKE TECHNOLOGY SPECIFICALLY IN THIS CASE MALICIOUS PORNOGRAPHIC DEEP FIX. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON DISCUSSED DEEP FIX OUR FORD'S VIDEOS CREATED VIA ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHERE PERSONS LIKENESS INCLUDING THEIR FACE AND VOICE IS REALISTICALLY SWAPPED WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S. TO BE CLEAR DEEP FAKES LOOK REAL. THIS IS NOT AN ABILITY WE HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE AT LEAST OUTSIDE OF HOLLYWOOD. AND BECAUSE OF THIS HYPER REALISM OF DEEP TAKE TECHNOLOGY WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED BY ITS POTENTIAL FOR CYBER BULLING IN HARASSMENT AMONG OTHER CONCERNS. AND THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE FOR THIS CONCERN. SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF DEEP TAKE TECHNOLOGY IN LATE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN USED TO EXTENT THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN USED EXTENSIVELY TO INSERT WOMEN'S LIKENESSES INTO PORNOGRAPHIC FILMS WITHOUT CAN SENSE. MANY OF THESE VICTIMS HAVE BEEN CELEBRITIES BUT ALSO NON PUBLIC PERSONS HAVE BEEN TARGETED FOR EXAMPLE A CALIFORNIA WOMAN WITH A YOUNG CHILD WAS TARGETED. SHE BECAME WRACKED WITH FEAR AND SEVERE ANGUISH OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING CUSTODY -- CUSTODY OF HER CHILD TO OUR EX SPOUSE BECAUSE OF THE VIDEOS. A TEXAS WOMAN HAD PORNOGRAPHIC DEEP TAKES ADDED TO OUR BUSINESS PAGES. CAUSING OUR SEVERE LOSS OF INCOME AND SERIOUS REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER RON I YOU WITH TARGETED WITH DEEP WITH PORNOGRAPHIC DEEP FIX SIMPLY BECAUSE FOR WORK AS A JOURNALIST. THIS COMMITTEE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN COMMENDABLY AND WISELY APPROVED NEW LEGISLATION TO PREVENT THE NON CONSENSUAL DISTRIBUTION OF SENSITIVE IMAGES AND VIDEOS SO CALLED REVENGE PORN. NOW WITH THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE REVENGE PORN WITHOUT EVEN NEEDING ACTUAL FOOTAGE. AB TWELVE EIGHTY IS A NECESSARY ADDITION TO THAT WORK. IT IS A NARROWLY TAILORED CONSTITUTIONALLY COMPLIANCE RESPONSE TO A NEW DANGER THAT WILL PROTECT VULNERABLE WOMEN AND GIRLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THE ORGANIZATION FOR SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY STANDS IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DON CAP KEY ON BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN UP POSITION IT [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. KATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. AB TWELVE EIGHTY WOULD IMPOSE CRIMINAL PENALTIES ON CERTAIN FORMS OF SPEECH. THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS IS THAT THE TECHNOLOGY USED TO CREATE THE SPEECH IS SO DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS TECHNOLOGIES AS TO MAKE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE FALSE REPRESENTATIONS WILL BE BELIEVED MUCH GREATER. THEREBY INCREASING THE HARM CAUSED BY THOSE REPRESENTATIONS TO A DEGREE THAT REQUIRES THE STATE TO IMPOSE CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. BUT HUMAN BEINGS HAVE LONG BEEN ABLE TO DEPICT THINGS THAT DID NOT ACTUALLY OCCUR USING IMAGES AND USING SPOKEN AND WRITTEN LANGUAGE AS LONG AS WE'VE BEEN DOING IT SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DECEIVED BY THESE DEPICTIONS. AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HURT BY THOSE FALSEHOODS. WHEN A DEEP FAKE VIDEOS DISTRIBUTED ON THE INTERNET THE LIKELIHOOD OF FOOLING PEOPLE IS IS NOT GREATER IN THE NATURE OF THE HARM IS NOT DIFFERENT THAN ONE A FALSE STORY IS DISTRIBUTED OR FAKED PHOTOGRAPH? WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE DANGER OF ALLOWING THE GOVERNMENT TO CRIMINALLY PROECUTE INDIVIDUALS FOR MAKING OR DISTRIBUTING FALSE STATEMENTS THINK OF THE IMPACT ON NEWS REPORTING. IF THE DOWNSIDE OF A WRONG CALL AS TO TO THE THE LEGITIMACY AND AND TRUTHFULNESS OF SOME OF OF A PIECE OF MEDIA. IS A POTENTIAL FELONY CONVICTION. EXISTING LAWS ALREADY ALLOW FOR CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FOR MUCH OF THE ACTIVITY COVERED IN THIS BILL INCLUDING REAL OR FAKE CHILD ****. CIVIL REMEDIES ARE AVAILABLE FOR OTHER TYPES OF BEHAVIOR SUCH AS A FAKE PORNOGRAPHIC VIDEO THAT IS DISTRIBUTED. CALIFORNIA NEED NOT RESPOND TO THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY BY INFRINGING ON THE FREE SPEECH RIGHTS OF ITS RESIDENTS IT CAN PROTECT THOSE RIGHTS WHILE CONTINUING TO PROTECT THOSE HARMED BY FALSE AND HARMFUL SPEECH IN ANY FORM. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU. MARGOT GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION -- I WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR AMENDING THE BILL AND TAKING OUT THE ELECTION PIECE UNFORTUNATELY WE STILL NEED TO OPPOSE THE BILL. AND ONE THING THAT I WOULD GO UP IS ECHO THIS YEAR'S COMMENTS BUT ALSO -- BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION OF PENAL CODE SECTION. FOUR TWENTY TWO BECAUSE WE FOR SEE THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS HAS LIMITS ONCE YOU PASS SOMETHING LIKE THIS THE COURT THEN INTERPRETED AS THEY WILL. AND IT BECOMES -- SORT OF CREEPING CRIMINALIZATION IN FOR TWENTY TWO IT HAS SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THE SAYS IMMEDIATE THREAT. ON ITS SAYS IT MUST BE UNCONDITIONAL. AND IN ORDER TO BE CRIMINAL -- THE COURTS HOWEVER AN APPLICATION HAVE ELIMINATED THESE REQUIREMENTS DESPITE THE VERY PLAIN LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE. AND THEY HAVE ALLOWED A CONVICTION TO STAND EVEN IF THE THREAT IS CONDITIONAL. AND EVEN IF IT'S NOT IMMEDIATE SO WE FOUR SEE THE SAME KIND OF CREEP BEING. A CRIMINALIZATION HERE. AND I STE AGREE WITH THIS YEAR'S COMMENTS THAT THEY'RE ALREADY REMEDIES FOR THOSE -- PEOPLE CAN SUE FOR DAMAGES MANY OF THE THINGS THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT WITH THE MOTIONAL DISTRESS. ON THEM. YOU KNOW LOSS OF INCOME DREW TO BUSINESS LOSSES ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE DOT DEALT WITH EVERY DAY IN THE CIVIL COURTS. AND THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO SEND PEOPLE TO JAIL OR PRISON OVER SPEECH. WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE RESPECTFULLY. GOOD MORNING WOULD BE PROUD WITH THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS -- I UNDERSTAND YOU A FULL AGENDA TODAY SO I'LL BE BRIEF SEE AN PA'S OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED TO THIS BILL -- WE HAVE A NUMBER SPECIFIC CONCERNS THAT ARE DISCUSSED IN OUR LETTER OUR OVERARCHING CONCERN IS -- OVER BROUGHT THEM VAGUENESS ISSUES WITH THIS BILL AND THAT AB TOLD EIGHTY COULD NOT ONLY RESULTED IN. ACTUAL PUNISHMENT OF FORMS OF EXPRESSION BUT THAT IT WOULD ALSO HAVE A PROFOUND CHILLING EFFECT ON SPEECH AND SO WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR. OF BEING WILLING TO WORK WITH US ON THIS BILL AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO MAKE SURE THE BILL IS AS NARROWLY TAILORED AS POSSIBLE [inaudible] THE THE SECOND. SO. HE FINISHED AND FINISH. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. DAN YOUR TEARS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. JUST. JUST A COMMENT I MEAN. PORNOGRAPHIC DEEP FAKES ARE NOT A FORM OF EXPRESSION THAT AT BY ANY STRETCH ACCEPTABLE. BY ANY STANDARD I WOULD HOPE NOT -- TO WE HAVE REALLY SUNK TO A NEW LOW. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. YES. BAUER-KAHAN THE COUPLE QUESTIONS OF MR GRAYSON SO AS I READ IT THE PART THAT CONCERNS ME THE MOST OF THE EXPLOITATION OF GIRLS AND BOYS UNDER EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD BUT AS I READ IT WE ALREADY HAVE A CRIMINAL STATUTE THREE ELEVEN THAT DOES THAT. WHY HAVE YOU FELT THE NEED TO DO A SECONDARY STATUTE IS THERE? LEUPOLD SOMETHING MISSING ABSOLUTELY WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS COME OUT WE DO FIND THAT -- THERE ARE AREAS IN STATUTE WHERE IT MAY BE ADDRESSED BUT BECAUSE OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY. IT TAKES IT TO A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LEVEL BY WHICH THE LAW NEEDS TO BE UPDATED TO ADDRESS THE NEW TECHNOLOGY I WILL ALLOW. IT THROUGH THE CHAIR IF I MAY HAVE MY EXPERT WITNESS BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT AS WELL AS THE THE FREE SPEECH -- THAT OPPOSITION PRODUCT QUESTION NOW MY SECOND QUESTION. SO MY SECOND QUESTION IS ABOUT FREE SPEECH BUT SO TWO THREE ELEVEN I MEAN IT'S THREE ELEVEN INCLUDE SIMULATING SEXUAL CONTENT INCLUDING THAT THIS COMPUTER GENERATED SO I GUESS I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT. WOULD BE DIFFERENT SO IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY -- THE WAY THE LAW IS WRITTEN RIGHT NOW THE COURT ALREADY RULED IT ACTUALLY REQUIRES THAT PERSON TO BE IN THE ACT -- WHERE AS WITH DEEP FAKE THE PERSON DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO KNOW OR BE INVOLVED IN ANY ACT WHATSOEVER? ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE READS IMAGES OF THAT PERSON AND TAKES THOSE IMAGES AND M. PUTS IT INTO A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT VIDEO TO MAKE IT LOOK AS THOUGH THAT PERSON IS PRESENT IN THAT VIDEO. SO THE LAW RIGHT NOW IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY ONLY ADDRESSES THOSE THAT ARE IN THE ACTS. AND THEN THE CAN DO SOMETHING BUT THIS DOES NOT ADDRESS. THE DEEP FAKE ISSUE WHERE THE PERSON IS AN EVEN INVOLVED AT ALL SO THE COURTS HAVE. INTERPRETING HERE GENERATED IS NOT. DEEP THINKERS THAT. AND I'D LIKE TO HEAR THESE VALUES RESPONSE ACT THAT SURPRISES ME BUT MAYBE THERE'S A CASE IT'S NOT YES I WILL YES I'M HAPPY TO HAVE HIM HE'S A LOT MORE YEAH. THERE IS A CASE ON SECTION THREE ELEVEN POINT ELEVEN IT'S THE GERBER CASE -- DECIDED IN -- TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE COURT IN THAT CASE HELD THAT THE PHRASE THE MATTER DEPICTS A PERSON UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN YEARS. PERSONALLY ENGAGING IN OR SIMULATED SEXUAL CONDUCT TO REQUIRE REAL CHILD TO ACTUALLY ENGAGE. IN THESE SEXUAL CONDUCT DEPICTED. OKAY SO IT WOULD NOT COVER. DEPICTS AS DEFINED UNDER AB TWELVE EIGHTY CAN I ASK THE ACLU'S THAT YEAR DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE TO THAT THE LIKE. TO I'M SORRY I'M NOT OKAY OKAY -- AND THEN YES MY SECOND QUESTION IS I AM ACTUALLY I'M SORRY I FORGOT YOUR NAME. WHITNEY BUT I AM. YOU KNOW I I AGREE WITH MR LACKEY OF IT I'M NOT SUPER CONCERNED ABOUT EXPLOITING CHILDREN UNDER EIGHTEEN WHEN IT COMES TO FREE SPEECH ESPECIALLY -- AND I THINK THAT THAT WOULD PASS MUSTER AND SO I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT YOUR FREE SPEECH CONCERNS ARE BECAUSE THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS OBVIOUSLY. WE WOULD NEVER WANT TO CHILL IT WHERE IT IS LEGITIMATE -- SHORE AND AND CERTAINLY WE'RE NOT AT A PROPONENT OF EXPLOITING. REACH CHARTER AND I HOPE THAT WOULD BE. A VERY CLEAR TO EVERYONE HERE BUT WAS THERE -- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS ONE IS THE BILL APPLIES NOT ONLY -- TO IT APPLIES TO DISTRIBUTION AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN AMENDMENTS PUT IN TO TRY AND CLARIFY THAT WE FEEL LIKE THEY'RE STILL UNCLEAR THAT IF THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS -- EVEN JUST DISTRIBUTOR CLIPS THAT THAT COULD BE INTERPRETED AS A DEPICTED BECAUSE OF AWAY AN ACTUAL EVENT ADDED -- ON THE THE CHILDREN SPECIFIC PIECE OF THE BILL. IT'S AN ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION SO IT COULD APPLY TO SITUATIONS THAT ARE NOT JUST PORNOGRAPHIC AND I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE ASHCROFT CASE THAT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAS ISSUED THEY TALK ABOUT. WHAT ARE THE COMMUNITY STANDARDS AND THAT THERE CAN BE SITUATIONS IN WHICH -- THE DEPICTION OF A MINOR ENGAGING IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY LIKE IN A MOVIE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT MAYBE NOT ON A PORNOGRAPHIC LEVEL NECESSARILY. COULD BE PROTECTED SPEECH AND SO THAT'S WHY WE THINK THE BILL NEEDS TO BE NARROWLY TAILORED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED. MR GRACING CAN ASK IF WE HAVE YOUR COMMITMENT TO WORK TO NARROW IT SO AS NOT TO CHILL SUCH SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE BILL IS VERY NARROWED ALREADY TO PORNOGRAPHIC MATERIAL HOWEVER. WE ARE MORE THAN WILLING TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION TO MAKE EVEN MORE CLARITY AS FAR. AS THE UNDERSTANDING THE BILL BY OPPOSITION AND THROUGH THE CHAIR I JUST WANTED ALSO CLARIFY IT'S NOT JUST DISTRIBUTION THE BILL ACTUALLY IS ATTEMPTING. WORKING AT LINKING BOTH CREATION AND DISTRIBUTION TOGETHER SO -- SO THAT THERE'S NO LOOPHOLE LEFT AND THERE'S ACTUALLY A CASE ON THIS IF I MAY -- TO THE CHAIR I HAVE MY WITNESS BE ABLE TO ADDRESS HER ANSWER HER QUESTION. BUDGET IF IT'S YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION. AS FAR AS THE THE LINKAGE OF THE FIRST COMMENT THAT WAS MADE BY OPPOSITION AND THEIR ANSWER TO THE MEMBER HER QUESTION IS A OKAY. WELL THEN MY MY ANSWER BACK TO YOU IS THAT YES WE ARE WORKING WITH OPPOSITION BUT WE ALSO THROUGH THE CHAIR NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OPPOSITION -- WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE BILL IS NOT JUST LIMITED TO DISTRIBUTION THAT ACTUALLY IN READING THE BILL YOU FIND THAT IT'S THE CREATION AND DISTRIBUTION THAT IS BEING LINKED -- TO THOSE TWO THAT ARE BEING LINKED TOGETHER. SO YES WE WILL WORK WITH OPPOSITION CONTINUE AND COMMITTED THANK YOU. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE MISSED GRAYSON. THANK YOU FOR THE CLOSE CONSIDERATION OF THIS MEASURE. AT ITS HEART THIS BILL IS FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND NOTHING REYES TODAY IS ABSOLUTELY UNWORKABLE BUT THIS ISSUE DEMANDS ACTION. CYBER BULLYING IS HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND NEW TECHNOLOGY BRINGS NEW THREATS THIS IS UNDENIABLE. AS THE PARENT OF TWO CHILDREN RATE -- AS THE PARENT OF TWO CHILDREN RAISING THEM IN THE DIGITAL AGE I'VE FIRST I'VE HAD FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE OF THE DANGERS OF SOCIAL MEDIA THE INTERNET AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES. IMAGINE IF YOUR CHILD WAS THE VICTIM OF AN EXPLICIT DEEP FAKE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ACTUAL RECOURSE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE -- AND FOR THE UNFORTUNATE ISSUES OF DEEP FAKES WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO HAVE RECOURSE TO ENTITIES THAT CAN ASSIST IN FINDING THE PERSON WHO CREATED. AND DISTRIBUTED THE VIDEO THAT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT IS CAUSING YOUR CHILD TO CONTEMPLATE SUICIDE. IMAGINE THE PAIN AND TRAUMA THIS WOULD INFLICT ON YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY I ASK THAT YOU PLEASE HELP MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. AND I WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE THE COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS RAISED TODAY AS WELL AS OPPOSITION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND IT AND AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS THIS -- ISSUE TO THE FOREFRONT SO WE CAN HAVE A ROBUST DISCUSSION -- AND I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE MORE DISCUSSION ARE THE CHALLENGES OF IF IT WERE TO LEAVE THIS COMMITTEE THE ONLY HAVE. MAYBE TWO WEEKS OR THREE WEEKS IN MAY I THINK THIS NEEDS A LOT MORE DISCUSSION AND THAT'S WHY WOULD A YOU KNOW -- I WAS I WAS HOPING THAT YOU WOULD MAKE THIS A TO YOUR BILL SO THAT YOU COULD. WORK THROUGH ALL THE DIFFERENT ISSUES I MEAN I EVEN HAVE PEOPLE COMING TO ME ABOUT THE POLITICAL PART ISN'T COMPLETELY RESOLVED. EVEN WHICH AMENDMENTS THAT YOU YOU'VE SUBMITTED THAT WE STILL NEED SOME DISCUSSION ON THAT. AND AGAIN THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I THINK WE CAN. WE CAN GET DONE IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME -- AND SO I'M GONNA CHAIRS ARE RECOMMENDED NO. BUT MORE IMPORTANT OR RECOMMEND THAT WE TAKE. YOU ON YOUR WORD THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH BOTH SIDES. ASK FOR RECONSIDERATION IF IT DOESN'T GET OUT OF HERE. AND WE WORK ON THIS SO THAT WE SMOOTHED IT ALL OUT HERE'S HERE'S HERE'S A POINT WE WE CAN'T. RUSH LOS. BECAUSE THEY HAVE CONSEQUENCES. AND JUST TO GET IT DONE FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING IT DONE. IT EXPRESSION PUBLIC SAFETY BECAUSE IT HAS AN EFFECT ON SO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE ESPECIALLY UNINTENDED. THINGS THAT WE KEEP HEARING FROM THE OPPOSITION THE GOOD PART IS YOU'RE WILLING. TO WORK THROUGH THAT AND I AM LOOKING AT THE OPPOSITION I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE EXTREMELY HAPPY THAT YOU DID MAKE SOME AMENDMENTS. AND SO I THINK THEY'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU AND SO -- TWO CHAIRS RAKING IN A NO. WELL HOPEFULLY THAT WE CAN HOPEFULLY GET TO A RESOLUTION LATER ON WE CAN. PROBABLY MOVE IN SECOND ON AB TWELVE EIGHTY THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER NO LACKEY BARRICADE HAN [inaudible] DEEP [inaudible] KAMLAGER-DOVE. QUIRK. QUIRK NO SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO NO WICKS. WICKS NOW. THAT MEASURE FAILED. ARE YOU ASKING FOR ME I HAVE A RECONSIDER -- NOTICE OF RECONSIDERATION YES WITHOUT X. WELL. THANK YOU WELL HAVEN'T WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR QUORUM IT SHOULD GET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] NOW. YES WILL ANNOUNCE IT WHEN WE GET A QUORUM ON RECONSIDERATION. NOW AB [inaudible] NINE TWO EIGHT AT MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB NINE TWENTY EIGHT PROTECTS CHILDREN BY ALLOWING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO QUICKLY OBTAIN BASIC ACCOUNT INFORMATION FROM ISPS. IN CASES OF CHILD **** AND CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING. IN THESE CASES LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN RECEIVE AN I. P. ADDRESS LINK TO INSTANCES. OF CHILD **** AND CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING FROM A CONGRESSIONALLY ESTABLISHED AND U. S. DOJ FUNDED CLEARING HOUSE. THE NATIONAL CENTER OF MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDREN. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS NECK MAC. TO BEGIN INVESTIGATING THE IP ADDRESS RIGHT NOW LAW ENFORCEMENT MUST SUBMIT TO SEARCH WARRANTS THE FIRST ONE IS TO OBTAIN BASIC ACCOUNT INFORMATION LIKE SOMEONE'S NAME ADDRESS TELEPHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL ADDRESS. THE SECOND ONE IS USED FOR SITUATIONS THAT MOST OF US ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH. THAT IS TO SEARCH A PERSON PLACE SUCH AS A HOME OR THINGS SUCH AS A COMPUTER. AB NINE TWENTY EIGHT WILL MAINTAIN THE SECOND WARRANT REQUIREMENT IN ORDER TO SEARCH A PERSON PLACE OR THING BUT CHANGE THE FIRST TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA. THIS CHANGE WILL ALLOW LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO QUICKLY OBTAIN A SUSPECT'S BASIC ACCOUNT INFORMATION BEFORE THE SUSPECTS CHANGE THEIR IP ADDRESSES WHICH CAN BE DONE IN A MATTER OF MINUTES. BECAUSE 5285% OF PEOPLE WHO VIEWED CHILD **** ALSO ABUSE A CHILD IN THEIR LIVES THIS BILL CAN PREVENT REAL TANGIBLE HARM TO CHILDREN. BY ALLOWING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THE SAME ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA AUTHORITY THAT ALREADY EXIST AND FEDERAL LAW AND IN THREE STATES AB NINE TWENTY EIGHT WILL ULTIMATELY SAVE AND PROTECT CHILDREN'S LIVES. MY WITNESSES ARE HERE WITH ME TODAY AND I WILL ALLOW THEM TO SELF INTRODUCE [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CHRISTINE MAGALY I'M A SERGEANT WITH THE CONCORD POLICE DEPARTMENT. FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS I CURRENTLY SUPERVISOR SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT. AND DEAL SPECIFICALLY WITH THIS TOPIC ON A DAILY BASIS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TODAY THAT YOU UNDERSTAND I'M HERE TO TESTIFY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. NINE TWENTY EIGHT A BILL THAT WOULD EASE THE BURDEN OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO CONDUCT THOROUGH [inaudible] INVESTIGATIONS [inaudible] DURING. ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD ABUSE WHETHER IT BE SEXUAL EXPLOITATION CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING. OR IN A SIMPLE FORM OF POSSESSION OF CHILD **** AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- ADDRESSED THERE IS. TESTIFIED TRUTH THAT RECIDIVISM. IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST. FOR SEX OFFENDERS. AS WELL AS THE IMPORTANCE OF PRE EXISTING LAW THAT WE'RE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS DOING. IT'S IMPORTANT -- THAT I EXPLAIN A CYBER TIP PROCESS HOW DO WE WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM WHAT DOES IT MEAN A WHAT WE D WITH THE NFORMATION -- IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN NECK MAC THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR EXPLOITED AND MISSING CHILDREN THEY ARE OUR FEDERAL CLEARING HOUSE THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING. ALL [inaudible] INFORMATION [inaudible] AND KEEPING STATS AND DATABASES ON CHILD EXPLOITATION. CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING CHILD ABUSE AND MISSING AND ABDUCTED CHILDREN. SO THE FIRST POINT IN THE WORK FLOW PROCESS SB CYBER TIP IN WHICH ESSENTIALLY. AT THE LAST POINT GOES TO YOUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ITS FIRST REPORTED TO NECK MAC. NECK NECK HOUSE ITS OWN INTERNAL ABILITY TO DO SOME BASIC INVESTIGATION AND THEIR JOB IS TWO FOLD. NUMBER -- ONE TWO EVALUATE THE INFORMATION AND INCLUDED IN THEIR DATABASE AND STATISTICS AND THEN NUMBER TWO TO DETERMINE THE CORRECT SURE SUBJECTION OF WHO HAS AUTHORITY. TO INVESTIGATE AND ULTIMATELY CHARGE ANY SUSPECT WHOSE -- BEEN DETERMINED TO BE A CRIMINAL SPECIFICALLY FOR THOSE SEX CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN. THAT INFORMATION GOES FROM NECK MAC. TO THE STATE'S TASK FORCE THAT NECK NECK DETERMINES WHERE. A WHERE THE JURISDICTION IS SO FOR INSTANCE [inaudible] MICROSOFT MAY. REPORT A TIP TO NECK MAC THAT SAYS. THIS ACCOUNT USER OF OURS WE HAVE DETERMINED THERE'S POSSIBLE CHILD **** ON THEIR EMAIL THAT THEIR TRADING IT OR AND OR SHARING IT. BY FEDERAL STATUTE. MICROSOFT HAVE JUST REPORTED TO NECK NECK NECK MICHAEL ANALYZE IT HAD IT DOWN TO THE STATE'S. INTERNET CRIMES TASK FORCE THE TASK FORCE WILL THEN EVALUATE THE JURISDICTION THE LEVEL OF POTENTIAL CRIME THE PRIORITY I II IS THEIR CHILD IN IMMEDIATE DANGER. OR IS IT IS THERE NO EVIDENCE OF THAT AND WE DID ITWILL BAN REQUIRE ADDITIONAL -- INVESTIGATION BUT LOCAL EXCUSE ME THAT THE STATE TASK FORCE WILL THEN ASSIGN IT TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. BASED ON THAT I. S. P. INFORMATION. THAT IN ITSELF. TYPICALLY NECK MAKE. GOAL IS TO MAKE THAT INFORMATION DOWN TO THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WITHIN SEVEN TO TEN BUSINESS DAYS. NOT NOT A WHOLE LOT OF TIME. FOR US TO THEN FOLLOW THROUGH WITH TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY THOSE I. S. P. ADDRESSES CAN BE CHANGED WITHIN HOURS. THE CURRENT SEARCH WARRANT PROCESS OFTEN REQUIRES AND TAKES SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS. ON AVERAGE AND THAT'S BEING VERY CONSERVATIVE FOR US AT A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT LEVEL. TO OBTAIN JUST BASIC ACCOUNT INFORMATION. SO ALTHOUGH WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE FOURTH AMENDMENT ISSUE AND THE NEED. THAT CALIFORNIA HAS SPECIFICALLY SAID WE WANT MORE THAN JUST A FOURTH AMENDMENT PROTECTION WE WERE. AT HENCE THE CREATION OF CAL AQABA. THE ISSUE IS WITH HOW ACT BUT AND THIS WHOLE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS. IS. BASIC ACCOUNT INFORMATION IS CONSIDERED. BASED ON REASONABLE SUSPICION. THE ENTIRE CAL F. BUT AND CURRENT SEARCH WARRANT PROCESS IS BASED ON PROBABLE CAUSE. THOSE ARE NOT APPLES AND APPLES THOSE ARE APPLES AND ORANGES AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND. THE VERY FIRST STEPS. OF INVESTIGATION TO THE CYBER TIPS. IS NOT INTRUSIVE. IT'S COLLECTING BASIC INFORMATION AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE GIVENLOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. THE AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT BASIC INVESTIGATIONS TO DEVELOP THEN A PROBABLE CAUSE BASED ON REASONABLE SUSPICION AND THE FACT THAT WE GO THROUGH DURING THE TYPICAL INVESTIGATION. SO FOR INSTANCE [inaudible] IF. I WAS PATROLLING A STREET. A SOMEONE WALKS ACROSS TO CLOCK IN MORNING CARRYING A BIG TV. YOU HAVE SAID. IT'S MY A RESPONSIBILITY TO STOP AND TALK TO THAT PERSON THAT IS REASONABLE SUSPICION. THAT IS HOW. LOW ON THE TOTEM POLE INVASIVE FOURTH AMENDMENT. ISSUE IS AT THE SUBPOENA PROCESS THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR MEETS THAT LEVEL IT'S A VERY LOW WE ABSOLUTELY WANT TO PROTECT OUR CITIZENS. AND WE ABIDE BY CAL EXPO. BUT THIS IS WAY BELOW THOSE PROBABLE CAUSE STANDARDS THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JEFF GORDON A DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY FROM SAN DIEGO AND HERE ARE PRESENTING THE ELECTED SUMMER STAFF AND IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL -- I'VE BEEN A PROSECUTOR FOR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AND HELPED START THE SANDY -- I CÃ¡C -- WHICH PROTECTS CHILDREN THERE SIXTY ONE SETS TASK FORCES AND WHAT THE SERGEANT EXPLAINS IS TRUE SEEN A MAN WALK ACROSS THE STREET WITH A TV. EVER ONE ONE A POLICE OFFICER TO STOP THE MAN WALKING WITH A TV AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BECAUSE THAT IS REASONABLE SUSPICION. DOES THAT OFFICER AT THAT POINT BELIEVE. THAT A CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED IS BEING COMMITTED OR WILL BE COMMITTED AND THAT'S THE LEVEL OF REASONABLE SUSPICION WE ALL WANT THAT POLICE OFFICER TO STOP THAT PERSON CARRYING THE TV. THERE MAY BE AN INNOCENT THING I'M MOVING OUT OF MY APARTMENT I GOT TO BE OUT BY SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING IT'S MY TV THERE'S MY CAR OKAY. INVESTIGATION DONE BUT IF HE'S GOT A NOT AS GOOD ANSWER THEN THE OFFICER AT REASONABLE SUSPICION HAS THE ABILITY TO DETAIN THE PERSON AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT IT RISES TO THE THE OFFICER IN HER MIND. HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE HAS BEEN A CRIME COMMITTED TO THE LEVEL THAT SHE CAN NOW ARREST HIM. WHERE'D YOU GET THE TV I DON'T KNOW WHERE'S THE BOX FOR THE TV I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GET THE TV MY FRIEND. THAT PERSON'S GOING TO BE NOW DETAINED AND ARRESTED FOR POSSESSION OF STOLEN PROPERTY MOST LIKELY. WHAT I'M HERE TO HELP EXPLAIN TO THE COMMITTEE IS THAT FROM READING THIS BELL AND WHEN I LOOK THROUGH THIS THIS WILL HELP CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA? THERE'S THREE STATES THAT DO THIS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALREADY DOES IT IN FACT. THERE WAS A CASE IN TWENTY TWELVE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- DEFENDANT WAS -- IT WAS THE CASE OF US VERSES GOLDEN ELECTRIC AND THE D. E. A.. ISSUED AN ADMIN SUBPOENA FOR INFORMATION AND THE DEFENDANT WHO IS CHARGED IN THE CASE SAID WHOA THAT'S A VIOLATION OF THE FOURTH AMENDMENT WENT UP THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS SAID NO THAT IS NOT A VIOLATION. BECAUSE YOU'VE GIVEN OVER THAT INFORMATION ITS THIRD PARTY PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE SENSE OF IN THIS CASE WHAT WE WOULD LIKE THIS BILL TO DO IS LOWERED THE STANDARD IN THE SENSE THAT IT RIGHT NOW IS PROBABLE CAUSE. BUT WE'RE STARTING OUT THE INVESTIGATION IT'S LIKE IN THE OLD DAYS. AND SOME OF YOU WILL KNOW AND SOME OF YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TO KNOW YOU COULD PICK UP THE PHONE AND SAY HEY -- WHAT IS THE PHONE NUMBER OF JIM JACKSON AND THEY WOULD GIVE YOU THE PHONE NUMBER THAT'S ALL WE'RE ASKING IS IF A POLICE OFFICER GETS INFORMATION FROM THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING EXPLOITED CHILDREN? THERE IS AN EMAIL WITH SUSPECTED CHILD ****. THAT GOES TO AN I. CÃ¡C SOMEWHERE IN SAN DIEGO SAN JOSE SOMEWHERE AND THEY START. THE INVESTIGATION AND ISSUE A SUBPOENA TO VERIZON WE HAVE THIS EMAIL ADDRESS WE HAVE THIS POTENTIAL CRIME WE'D LIKE TO KNOW WHO IS ATTACHED TO THIS EMAIL ADDRESS. MANY OF THOSE STEPS. START WITH JUSTIN EMAIL ADDRESS WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR CONTENT THAT REQUIRES A SEARCH WARRANT THAT REQUIRES PROBABLE CAUSE WE'RE ASKING FOR NO CONTENT ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR IS FOR NAME ADDRESS AND YOU SAW THE LIST OF SEVEN THINGS THAT WE REQUESTED. IN FACT THE ANALYSIS WAS EXCELLENT IN THAT PART BECAUSE SAYS NOT TO DISCLOSE ANY OF THE OTHER INFORMATION THAT'S PROTECTED UNDER THE FOURTH AMENDMENT. SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMITTEE KNOWS AND UNDERSTANDS IS THAT AS A CHILD SEX CRIMES PROSECUTOR. I WANT TO GIVE THE POLICE OFFICERS THE ABILITY TO WORK ON THEIR CASES IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE I'M NOT INVOLVED. AND WHAT I WANT TO DO IS BE ABLE TO HELP THE COMMITTEE WITH ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE AS FAR AS HOW THIS WILL HELP SUPPORT. THE INVESTIGATIONS OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE OKAY THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR DON KHAKI ON BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED OF CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT [inaudible] YES. TWENTY MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS WHO SHALL MUCH FAR BEYOND THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION WE HAVE. PEOPLE COMING FISCAL GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS KATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. AB NINE TWENTY EIGHT WOULD GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT THE POWER TO GET AN INTERNET USERS ACCOUNT INFORMATION UPON REASONABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THE ACCOUNT HAS BEEN USED IN THE EXPLOITATION OF A CHILD. THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SEEKING AGENCY SEEKING THE INFORMATION WOULD MAKE THE DETERMINATION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES REASONABLE COST. AND ALSO OF WHAT IS INCLUDED IN EXPLOITATION OF A CHILD WHICH IS NOT DEFINED IN THE BILL. THERE WOULD BE NO COURT OVERSIGHT AS TO WHETHER THERE WAS SUFFICIENT BECAUSE EVEN THE UNDEFINED REASONABLE BECAUSE REQUIRED UNDER THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL TO LINK THE ACCOUNT OR ACCOUNTS IN QUESTION TO THE ALLEGED EXPLOITATION. THERE WOULD BE NO COURT COURT OVERSIGHT TO LIMIT THE INFORMATION THAT COULD BE DEMANDED. AND THERE WOULD BE NO REQUIREMENT THAT THE TARGET OF THE INVESTIGATION EVER BE NOTIFIED OR THAT INFORMATION INAPPROPRIATELY OBTAINED BE SEALED OR DELETED. AS REQUIRED FOR A SEARCH OF ELECTRONIC INFORMATION UNDER CAL ACT. ALL OF THIS IS SIMPLY UNNECESSARY MODERN PROCEDURES ALLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GET WARRANTS BY PHONE AND TO SEND AND RECEIVE NEEDED DOCUMENTS BY EMAIL WITH MINIMAL DELAY. THIS BILL ISN'T JUST ABOUT LOT ALLOWING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GET INFORMATION WITHOUT COMPLYING WITH CAL ACT. IT TENDS TO GET AROUND THE FOURTH AMENDMENT ENTIRELY ALLOWING INFORMATION TO BE DEMANDED FROM INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS WITHOUT COURT OVERSIGHT. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER IN PROTECTING THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF ITS RESIDENTS IT SHOULD NOT TAKE THIS HUGE STEP AWAY FROM THOSE PROTECTIONS. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NOBLE [inaudible] THANK YOU. MARGOT GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION WE ALSO OPPOSE THE BILL I APPRECIATE CONVERSATIONS I HAD WITH THE AUTHOR STAFF. ABOUT THE BILL. AND I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT MEASURE IS MADE FROM THE ACLU -- THIS BILL IS NOT NECESSARY -- IN AN EMERGENCY CAL UP A ALREADY PERMITS A WAR IT'S LESS ACCESSIBLE LIKE TRONIC DEVICE INFORMATION BY MEANS OF EITHER PHYSICAL INTERACTION OR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION WITH THE DEVICE. IN INVOLVING DANGER OF OF DEATH OR SERIOUS PHYSICAL INJURY. UNDER PENAL CODE SECTION FIFTEEN FORTY SIX POINT ONE SUBDIVISION C.. SIX IN CASE YOU WANT THE SITE -- BUT EVEN IN THE SITUATION THAT THEY'RE SAYING IF THEY HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE THEY CAN GET MORE. AND ASTHMA YEAR SAID A YOU JUST CALL UP. AND THE MAGISTRATE SWEAR SHOOT YOU. AN USE RECITE THE FACTS THAT YOU BELIEVE GIVE YOU PROBLEM. WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR AND THEY'VE BEEN CANDID ABOUT IT IS THIS MUCH LOWER STANDARD OF -- REASONABLE SUSPICION THEY'RE CALLING IT REASONABLE CAUSE WHICH IS WHAT IT'S CALLED IN A LOT OF FEDERAL LITIGATION BUT IT THAT IS THE MERE. YOU KNOW THE STANDARD JUSTICE DETAIN SOMEONE BRIEFLY HERE THEY'RE TRYING TO GO INTO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM. AND YOU SO WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS THAT THIS BILL AB NINE TWENTY EIGHT IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE -- THEY'RE ASKING THAT YOU. CALIFORNIANS PRIVACY GIVE WAY TO THE NEEDS OF SUCH CHILD SEXUAL EXPLOITATION INVESTIGATIONS -- NEXT YEAR IT WILL BE ADULT HUMAN TRAFFICKING THEN IT WILL BE THE GANGS THEN IT WILL BE GUN PURCHASERS. FINALLY IF YOU MAKE ALL THESE LOOPHOLES ALL THESE EXCEPTIONS THERE IS NO -- CALIFORNIA ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT. AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. CHAD INJURES WITH THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. IT'S NOT YOUR HERNANDEZ -- HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] S.. BAUER-KAHAN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- SO. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO HELP EDUCATE ME ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE ISSUED AN ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FROM. YOU OR IF YOU'RE EXPERT TWENTY SPEAK TO IT ON WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT THAT REQUIRES. IF I MAY DIFFER TO MY WITNESS ON THAT. CHAIR. WITH. THE ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS A ONE PAGE SHEET FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO THE I. S. P. R. E. S. P. INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER LET'S SAY IT'S VERIZON. CONCORD POLICE THEY RIGHT OUT GET AN AUTHORIZATION FROM THE DETECTIVE AND FROM SOMEONE HIGHER UP -- THEY CAN'T DO THIS AT THIS POINT SO IT HAS TO BE A FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A STATE ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA AT THIS POINT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING. TO CREATE TO MIRROR THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA IF CONCORD PD WANTED TO DO IT TODAY THEY WOULD GO OVER TO HOMELAND SECURITY OR FBI THEY WOULD SWEAR OUT AN ADMIN SUBPOENA. THAT THERE IS REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT THERE HAS BEEN CHILD EXPLOITATION SEND IT TO VERIZON VERIZON WOULD THEN GET THAT INFORMATION AND THEN RETURN THAT WITHIN. A FEW WEEKS TO GIVE THEM THE SUBSCRIBER INFORMATION THAT THE LOWER LEVEL THE SUBSCRIBER INFORMATION OF THE SUSPECT. THIS IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND. AS I UNDERSTAND IT IN CALIFORNIA STATE LAW. YOU KNOW FEDERAL OUT BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY LAW WE DO NOT HAVE THIS LOCK CURRENTLY IT'S IF WE WERE TO DO IT THE MERE THE PARALLEL WOULD BE A FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA. KOTLI CAL ACT BUT SAYS WE HAVE TO DO A BY A SEARCH WARRANT RIGHT WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE AND SOMETIMES WE DON'T HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE WE NEED TO START WITH WE HAVE AN EMAIL ADDRESS. SO WE DON'T KNOW IF A CRIME IS BEING COMMITTED YET -- FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO SAY TO THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL IF IT IS TAKING SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS TO GET A SUBPOENA WHEN SOMEBODY'S LIFE THE NATURE I HOPE YOU BRING US BILLS THAT WILL ADDRESS THAT AS WELL BECAUSE THIS ISN'T THE ONLY SITUATION WHERE THAT'S A PUBLIC. SAFETY ISSUE -- ON TO DEFEND THAT PART OF IT THE EMERGENCY PART WE DO GET RESPONSE IN THE PHONE CAN BE PAYING THAN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION WHERE A CHILD HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED WE GET RISE IN IN THE VARIOUS COMPANIES WILL IMMEDIATELY RESPOND OKAY. SO THAT IS NOT RIGHT THAT'S NOT SIX WEEKS IT'S EITHER A MEDIA. DANGER WHICH IS RIGHT NOW THEY'LL THEY'LL DO IT -- SUBPOENAS TAKE WEEKS TO COME BACK AND SO -- SEARCH WARRANTS TAKE. OUT TWO MONTHS TO COME BACK SIX DAY WEEKS OKAY I'M SO. NOW KNOWING THAT THIS IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN CALIFORNIA READING THIS LAW IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME. THAT. THIS LAW SETS FORTH MUCH IF ANY PROCEDURE AS TO WHAT IT WOULD MEAN I ASSUME THERE WAS LOT ELSEWHERE THAT WOULD SET OUT WHAT THIS ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA PROCESS LOOK LIKE. WHO WOULD HAVE TO SIGN IT WHAT THE BURDEN WAS BUT? KNOWING NOW THAT THERE ISN'T ANY THIS LOSS SEEMS. MY EBAY IN THAT REGARDS SEEING AS I MEAN THE ONLY PARAGRAPH I SEE IS THE OPENING PARAGRAPH LEAVE. YOU KNOW THEY'LL ISSUE IN WRITING BECAUSE TO BE SERVED IN A MAYOR STRATUS SUBPOENA AND THEN WHAT CAN BE ASKED. FOR SO I'M JUST WONDERING. WHAT IF YOU'RE WANTING A RESPONSE YES OKAY THANK YOU SO WE WERE USING ANOTHER STATES -- KINDA TEMPLATE OKAY FOR THIS IN PARTICULAR WYOMING -- HOWEVER IN OUR OWN DISCUSSIONS AS WELL AS DISCUSSIONS WITH OPPOSITION -- WE HAVE MADE COMMITMENTS TO MAKING SURE THAT WE DO HAVE. A SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A FIRST YEAR INVESTIGATOR RUNNING OUT INTO AN ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA THAT THAT FIRST THAT -- THAT INDIVIDUAL -- WITHOUT THAT EXPERIENCE WOULD HAVE -- TO GET THE SIGNATURE OF A COMMANDER IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY AS WELL AS USING THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE SET UP ON A FEDERAL LEVEL NECK NECK AND CAL. I CAN'T STAY AT THIS POINT IT REQUIRES THE FAITH F. B. I. OFFICER IN HIS A SACK HIS ASSISTANT -- AREA COMMANDER TO SIGN OFF ON THAT SO IT'S NOT JUST. A YOU KNOW A ONE SIGNATURE THING IT DOES REQUIRE REASONABLE SUSPICION OF A CRIME AND TWO SIGNATURES BOTH THE DETECTIVE AND THE THE NEXT LEVEL UP HIS OR HER COMMANDER. SO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK ON WITH OPPOSITION AS WELL TO MAKE SURE WE CLARIFIED THE THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL SO THAT THERE WAS A VERY CLEAR PATHWAY -- TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU [inaudible] ACTIONS DURING. YOU MAY CLOSE WAS GRAYSON. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I DO HAVE A FEW CLOSING STATEMENTS WE LIVE IN A TIME OF STRONG FOURTH AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS. AND THAT'S ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD THING. AS WE LEARN HOW TO NAVIGATE PRIVACY CONCERNS IN THE INTERNET AGE. I THINK OUR APPROACH SHOULD BE VERY CAUTIOUS. ONE BUT THE CONVERSATIONSWE HAVE HAD WITH THOSE WHO HAVE ANALYZE THIS BILL HAVE FOCUSED SO WITH THE SOLELY ON PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AND NOT ON THE HARM OUR CURRENT LAW ALLOWS. AGAINST ONE OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND THAT'S OUR CHILDREN. ADDITIONALLY IT IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM THAT THE JOB OF THE LEGISLATURE IS TO WORK ON TOUGH AND EMERGING ISSUES ESPECIALLY IN TECHNOLOGY. THAT'S WHY WE ARE DOING THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH AB. NINE TWENTY EIGHT IF YOU THINK THAT PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM PHYSICAL HARM AND SEX TRAFFICKING IS A PRIORITY. THEN I ASK THAT YOU VOTE FOR THIS BILL. IF YOU THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD HANDLE THESE TOUGH AN EMERGING ISSUES. THAT I ALSO ASK THAT YOU WOULD VOTE FOR THIS BILL LET THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION CONTINUE AND KNOW THAT WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH ANYONE. WHO COMES TO US WITH ANY CONCERNS THANK THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE? THANK YOU -- SO UP ON THEIR RECOMMENDED NO. AND AND I YOU KNOW. AND I'M NOT CERTAIN. THIS IS THE RIGHT VEHICLE TO GET WHERE YOU WANT AND NEED I'VE. LISTENED TO SOME MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT. YOU CAN GET A SUBPOENA YOU SEEM LIKE YOU GET THIS STARTED. BUT GETTING IT BACK FROM THE I. S. P.'S WHERE SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM THAT MAY BE MORE OF A MAYBE NOT THIS COMMITTEE BUT OF AN INTERNET. TYPE OF THING AND WE PROBABLY SHOULD WORK ON THAT ALTERNATE BILL OF TO FIGURE THAT OUT. TO SOMETIMES I TELL PEOPLE DON'T. TALK TOO LONG WHAT MAKE DESCRIPTIONS OF BECAUSE WHEN YOU. YOU SAY SOMETHING ILL WILL. TRIGGER SOMETHING SOMEONE SAID THAT YOU DIDN'T MEAN FOR TO TRIGGER SO WHEN YOU SAY. I SEE SOMEONE WALKING ACROSS THE STREET WITH A TELEVISION. I HERE FIC AT BLACK MAN AFRICAN AMERICAN WALKING ACROSS STREET WITH A TELEVISION I GET. TO CROSS EXAMINE THEM ARREST DON'T CAUSE PROBABLE CAUSE IS OR IF I LOOK BACK AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE YOU ACTUALLY STOP IS RACIAL PROFILING AND THEN ALL OF US AND WE GO DOWN THE SLIPPERY SLOPE OF NOT DEALING WITH. PEOPLE WERE CHILD. MOLESTERS ARE PROBLEMATIC PEOPLE WERE DOING OTHER THINGS AND THAT. WHERE MY MY ANGST IS AND HOW DO YOU GET TO MAKE SURE AN S. THIS IS WHAT I THINK THE OPPOSITION IS HOW YOU GET TO MAKE SURE? THAT THIS DOESN'T SLIDE INTO SOMETHING ELSE THAT. YOU REALLY DID WANT. YOU ABSOLUTELY DIDN'T WANT TO HAPPEN -- BUT NOW WE WE'VE ALLOWED YOU TO GO INTO THAT CYBERSPACE. AND START TO GO AFTER INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE. BUT MOST IMPORTANT YOU LEFT THE CHECKS AND BALANCES OUT. OF CHECKING WITH SOMEONE LIKE A COURT -- JUDGE. TO KIND OF SAY. I SEE WHAT YOU HAVE. AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A SEARCH WARRANT. AND THIS ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES. DATING IS IT'S SO SCARY TO ME THAT WE JUST GIVE [inaudible] CARTE BLANCHE. TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WITHOUT ANY KIND OF CHECKS AND BALANCES TO TO DO ANYTHING AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S WHY WE RECOMMEND A NO VOTE AND WE REALLY SERIOUSLY CONSIDER HOW TO GET THIS. HOW YOU GET YOUR INFORMATION ON HOW YOU GET ACCESS THOSE EYES PEAS AND OTHERS THE VERIZON'S WHOEVER YOU NEED TO GET? TO TO GET IT. FROM THEM FASTER BECAUSE THEY SHOULDN'T TAKE [inaudible] THREE WEEKS [inaudible] SIXTY EIGHT WEEKS I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU CAN GET ON EMERGENCY BASIS THAT. IS THEY GAVE ME SOME. SOME RELIEF THAT YOU CAN GET THAT -- BUT THE THE FOR TO TAKE THAT LONG IS IS IN SOME WAYS IS CRIMINAL MAYBE IT DOES BELONG OVER HERE BUT WITH THAT I'M RECOMMENDING A NO VOTE MR [inaudible] WITHOUT [inaudible] SEC. AN EIGHTY NINE TWENTY EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER NO LACKEY. LACKEY NOT VOTING BAUER-KAHAN. BAUER-KAHAN NOT VOTING DEEP.

ITEM NUMBER TEN TWENTY AB ELEVEN EIGHTY TO BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE 2% ASSEMBLY BILL. ELEVEN EIGHTY TWO WHICH WILL STRAIGHTEN AND EXPAND THE EARNED THIS CHART PROCESS BY ALIGNING DISCHARGE TERMS WITH EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES. I WOULD LIKE TO START OFF BY THINGS IN THERE AND THE THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. AB ELEVEN EIGHTY TWO AUTHORIZES THE DISCHARGE OF PAROLEES WHO SCORE EIGHT AS LOWER MODERATE RISK FOR RECIDIVISM. AFTER COMPLETING THE INITIAL ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS OF SUPERVISION BY A SUPERVISION VIOLATION AND CARBON OUR CRIME FREE. FOR CERTAIN ROWLY POPULATIONS A CD THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION ON THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS. HAVE THE DISCRETION TO RETAIN PAROLEES FOR GOOD CAUSE I'D LIKE TO MAKE IT VERY VERY CLEAR. THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE EXISTING LAW ON SEX OFFENDERS AND LIFETIME PAROLEES. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL REQUIRES INDIVIDUALS AND POST COMMUNITY REALLY SUPERVISION P. R. C. S. TO BE REVIEWED AND CONSIDERED FOR EARLY DOES CHARGE IF THEY ARE CONTINUOUSLY SUPERVISED. FOR ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS WITHOUT VIOLATIONS STUDIES TRACKING PAROLE VIOLATION VIOLATIONS TRENDS HAVE SHOWN THAT A PAROLEES WHO REMAINS VIOLATION AN OFFENSE FREE FOR ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS OF SUPERVISION. ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO SUCCESSFULLY RE INTEGRATE INTO SOCIETY. PRESENTLY THE DECISION TO DISCHARGE A PAROLE YES PRIMARILY DICTATE. BY THEIR OFFENSE AND OPPOSED TO THE BEST PRACTICES AS AN INDIVIDUAL'S PUBLIC SAFETY RISK SUPERVISION APPROACHES THAT INCLUDE INCENTIVES LIKE THE POSSIBILITY OF EARNED DISCHARGE. HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CRIME FREE OUTCOMES. AB ELEVEN EIGHTY TWO WILL IMPROVE THE DISCHARGE PROCESS AND ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY BY REDUCING RECIDIVISM RATES AND REDIRECTING SUPERVISION RESOURCES TO THOSE PAROLEES WHO POSE HIGHER PUBLIC SAFETY RISK. DAY WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IS WILL GONZALEZ WHO -- IS NOW WITH HOMEBOY INDUSTRIES AND WE'LL SHARE PERSONAL TESTIMONY AS WELL AS THOMAS HOFFMAN. THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION DIVISION OF ADULT PAROLE THE OPERATIONS OR DA PEELED APPLE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THIS BILL. GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S TOM OFTEN I COME TODAY TO THE BOARD WITH -- FORTY FOUR YEARS IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SAFETY. THIRTY TWO OF IT IN -- MUNICIPAL LAW ENFORCEMENT LITTLE OVER TWENTY YEARS WITHIN WOULD PD LITTLE OVER TEN YEARS OF WAS SACRAMENTO OFFICER TO CHIEF IN THAT PROCESS -- IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX LIFE CHANGING EVENT OCCURRED NOT SO THE SCHWARZENEGGER ADMINISTRATION ASKED ME TO TAKE OVER A STATE PAROLE -- I DID THAT. I OPENING IN SO MANY WAYS IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE BUT AT LEAST OF WHICH HAVING BEEN ON THE IMPORT SIDE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. FOR THIRTY YEARS AND NOT OVERTLY CONTEMPLATING ALL THE DOWNSTREAM IMPLICATIONS OF OF A CARS RACE AND ALL THAT GOES WITH IT. ONCE THEY ASK YOU TO HEAD UP THE OUTBOUND SIDE OF THE SYSTEM PAROLE. YOU CERTAINLY ARE A HAVE AN EYE OPENING EXPERIENCE ABOUT THE INEFFICIENCIES AND SOME OF THE INEFFECTIVENESS. OF THE SYSTEM OVERALL AND CERTAINLY AS RELATES. TO POST INCARCERATIONS SUPERVISION AT PAROLE AND PROBATION. AND I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT WHAT THE ASSEMBLY BOB PERSONS HAD TO SAY BUT I ALSO I DO WANT. TO POINT OUT THAT IS IMPORTANT COMMITTED MEMBERS UNDERSTAND THE LEGITIMACY OF A DESTROYED FROM PAROLE SUPERVISION BASED ON COMPLIANCE AN OFFENSE FREE BEHAVIOR. AND RECOGNIZING THE RELEVANCY OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PERSON'S BEHAVIOR IN THE CRITICAL INITIAL HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS IT ISN'T JUST ANY HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS IS. THOSE FIRST SIX MONTHS WHEN THEY COME OUT REALLY REALLY TELLING -- ARE BOTH ALREADY CODIFIED IN THE PENAL CODE AT THREE THOUSAND ONE FOR THE CORPORAL LEASE UNDER DAPPLE CONTROL AND AT THREE FOUR FIVE SIX FOR WHAT WE NOW CALL THE POST RELEASE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION POPULATION. THEY BOTH ARE AUTHORIZED TO BE DISCHARGED A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS -- IF THEY ARE COMPLYING IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT THE CITY'S YOUR OFFICE OF RESEARCH CURRENTLY CURRENT PUBLISHED DATA DEFIES 48% OF THE POPULATION BEHIND OUR GATES. IS SUCKS SCORES AS LOW RISK ANOTHER 24% AS MODERATE RISK. IN A NUTSHELL OF WE'VE SUPERVISE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOW LOW MODERATE RISK WE TEND TO IMPROVE THE LIKELIHOOD OR INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY'RE GOING TO FAIL. IT'S ANTI PRODUCTIVE AS A GENERAL STATEMENT. AND SO WHAT AB BUT EIGHT ELIMINATE TO PROPOSES A IN A WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR DISTORTS DECISIONS BASED ON EVIDENCE AND RISK ASSESSMENT NON ARBITRARILY ASSIGNED. TIME LINES WHICH IS CURRENTLY THE CASE UNDER LAW USE USE OUR BEHAVIOR A COUPLE YEARS IF YOU'RE SIX SIX SEVEN WE LET YOU GO. WHAT DESTROYED YOU WITH NO REGARD FOR HOW DANGERS THAT PERSON MAY OR MAY NOT STILL BE EVEN OLDER SERVE SOMETIME ON PAROLE? RISK ASSESSMENTS OF VIABLE ADDITIONAL PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. AB FIVE TO ELEVEN EIGHTY TWO OH ALSO RECOGNIZES AND SUPPORTS THE ZIP LEGITIMATE NEED IN THE APPROPRIATE OF THE IMPORTANT WISDOM OF THE AGES AND SUPERVISORS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING THE PEARLY POPULATION IN OUR STATE. WHEN A DECISION TO RETAIN A PAROLEES IS CONSTRAINED TO PLAY IT? HOWEVER THERE IS A CONCERN THAT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PAROLE CAN'T TO OFF TO BECOME A PRESCRIPTION FOR PER UP FOR FAILURE. INSTEAD OF A ROAD MAP FOR SUCCESS AS THEIR INTENDED TO BE. WITH THESE THOUGHTS IN MIND AB WILL ELIMINATE TO MAINTAINS ALSO UNSUPERVISED DISCRETION WHILE CONCURRENTLY REQUIRING THE DECISION TO RETAIN. AN OTHERWISE QUALIFIED FRAWLEY. WITHIN THE CONFINES OF A NEW MORE SPECIFIC MORE OBJECTIVE DEFINITION OF GOOD COST. AND FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS I STRONGLY SUPPORT -- AB ELEVEN EIGHTY TWO THANK YOU. THE USED UP A LOT OF YOUR TIME SO YOU HAVE. TO THANK YOU A MY NAME IS TO GO GONZALEZ -- COME WITH HUMBLE INDUSTRIES -- FIRST I WANT TO SAY THAT I'M HUMBLED TO BE IN A ROOM WHERE BIG DECISIONS ARE MADE AND I KNOW THAT A LOT OF THOSE DECISIONS ARE MADE. OFF OF RESEARCH THAT INFECTION I WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS FOR THIS TIME -- I DID EIGHTEEN AND A HALF YEARS IN PRISON I WAS I'VE BEEN OUT FOR TEN MONTHS. OF GOVERNOR BROWN COMMUTED MY SENTENCE AND SINCE THEN. I'VE BEEN HIRED AT HOME WE INDUSTRIES OF ANA ANIMA UNDER A GOVERNMENT RELATIONS. AND I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO NOT ONLY SIT WITH DINNERS WITH GAVIN NEWSOM -- AND GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN AND BE ABLE TO SPEAK WITH STAFFERS ABOUT. REAL ISSUES BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I'VE BEEN ABLE TO TRAVEL THE UNITED STATES AND HAVE JOB OFFERS IN NEW YORK CHICAGO TEXAS. AND THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS IS THAT NO MATTER HOW MUCH I'VE APPRECIATED THE SERVICES THAT PEROT HAS PROVIDED. I ALSO HAVE. COME TO A POINT WHERE I'VE OUTGROWN THOSE SERVICES AND NOW IF ANYTHING IT BECOMES MORE OF A OF A OF A OF A NUISANCE NOT A NUISANCE BUT OF A OF A OF AN ILLUSION NO. NEW STEP OR A LEASH HAS HOLDING ME BACK. ON AND I'M JUST HERE TO REALLY EXPRESS THE FACT THAT AGAIN I APPRECIATE ALL THE SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN BUT I REALLY HOPE THAT. EVERYTHING IS BASED ON THE DATA THAT'S COLLECTED TODAY AND NOT ON OUTDATED DATA AND THE FRAME OF THOUGHT OF YESTERDAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NAME AN ORGANIZATION. MARGOT GEORGE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. JUST LIKE UNDER SOME OF CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUST AS THE SPONSOR AND STRONG SUPPORT. CAN YOU TEARS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND SUPPORT THANK YOU -- CARES WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING DANIEL SANCHEZ WITH THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE A POSITION BUT I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR -- IN CALIFORNIANS FOR SEEKING JUSTICE FOR ENGAGING IN A EARLY CONVERSATION WITH US -- WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM RELATIVE TO THE PIECES ON PIERCE YES WE LOOK FOR TO THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING COURTNEY HANSEN WITH -- CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR WOMEN PRISONERS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. ORDER ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY OPPOSITION. OF MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF LAURIE MORE SOME BEHALF CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION -- WE ARE REGRETFULLY OPPOSED AT THIS POINT STILL TO TO THIS -- PIECE OF LEGISLATION -- CURRENT LAW ALREADY STRIKES A GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN DISCHARGE FROM AND RETENTION OF AN OFFENDER ON SUPERVISION OF PAROLE THE MAY BE RETAINED ON PAROLE. PAST SIX MONTHS IF THERE IS GOOD CAUSE AN OFFENDER. ON P. R. C. S. MAY BE CONSIDERED FOR JUST CHARGE AFTER SIX MONTHS OF SUPERVISION. AND IS REQUIRED TO BE DISCHARGED FROM SUPERVISION AFTER ONE YEAR IF THERE ARE NO VIOLATIONS THAT RESULT IN A CUSTODIAL SANCTION. PAROLE AGENTS PROBATION OFFICERS AND SUPERVISING AGENCIES ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO KNOW WHETHER AN OFFENDER SHOULD BE RETAINED ON SUPERVISION. REHABILITATION IS KEY IN REDUCING RECIDIVISM AND HELPING OFFENDERS TO LEAD PRODUCTIVE LIVES AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED IN THIS COMMITTEE THE RECENT AUDITOR'S REPORT DID NOT PAINT A VERY FLATTERING PORTRAIT OF THE REHABILITATIVE WORK BEING DONE RIGHT NOW IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. SHORTENING ALREADY SHORT SUPERVISION PERIODS LESSONS AN OFFENDER'S CHANCE OF SUCCESSFUL REINTEGRATION INTO SOCIETY. SUPERVISING AGENCIES MUST HAVE THE ABILITY TO ASSESS EACH OFFENDER INDIVIDUALLY AND DETERMINE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS WHETHER AN OFFENDER NEEDS TO BE REVIEWED. NEEDS TO BE RETAINED ON SUPERVISION FOR THESE REASONS WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU. OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THEN YOU MAKE CLOTHES IN A DRESS. ANYTHING THT WAS SAID. SURE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND THIS WELL TO THE WITNESSES WHO ARE HERE BOTH IN SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COME TO THE TABLE TO A RESOLUTION AS TO WHAT'S NEEDED FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- IN REGARDS TO SOME OF THE OPPOSITION'S COMMENTS IN FACT THE CDC ARE THE BORE PAROLE HEARINGS STILL HAVE DISCRETION THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THAT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DO IS MAKE SURE THAT IN THE FIRST ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS WHICH ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT. WHEN A PRO THE COMES OUT AND WE INTEGRATE BACK INTO SOCIETY THAT THEY ARE GIVING EVERY CHANCE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE THEY ARE RE INTEGRATING IN A WAY THAT? FEASIBLE FOR THEM THAT'S INSTRUCTIVE TO OUR COMMUNITY THAT HELPS OUR COMMUNITY AND PUBLIC SAFETY AND THAT REDUCES CALIFORNIA'S RISK OF RECIDIVISM WE ARE ALREADY OVERPOPULATED WHEN IT COMES TO OUR INMATE POPULATION BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH CRIMINAL JUSTICE. LAWS AND REFORMS THAT WE ARE PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE NOW. WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY AND WITHIN SOCIETY TO LEAD THEIR BEST LIVES SO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND I AND I KNOW WE HAD SOMEONE FROM. ACOSTA CHEE PROBATION OFFICERS AT TO WANT TO WORK WITH YOU AND WORK THROUGH THIS WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES. THAT THE MANAGED TO PEOPLE THAT ARE IMPLEMENTING THIS. AND IN JUST FOR THE ONLY FOR MY OWN [inaudible] PERSONAL. MAKING SURE WE SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT -- SPECIALLY SINCE I AM THE ONE THAT COMMISSION OR ASK FOR THE AUDIT FOR REHABILITATION THE AUDIT ACTUALLY SAID. THAT CDC ART DOES NOT DO AN ADEQUATE DID NOT DO A GOOD JOB AT ALL. AT SHOWING HOW EFFECTIVE THESE PROGRAMS ARE IT DIDN'T SAY THEY WERE THE PROGRAMS ARE BAD SAID THEY JUST DO THAT. THEY DON'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB A MEASURING THEIR SUCCESS RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR TAXPAYERS WHEN IN. DETERMINING HOW PEOPLE DO NOT PERCENT OF AID WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO WORK ON AND AND MOVE FORWARD WITH. AND SO -- HOPEFULLY AS WE FOLLOW UP WILL GET BETTER NUMBERS AND STATISTICS AND AND HOPE FOR THAT CAN DOVETAILED INTO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. AND I THINK HOPEFULLY WILL GIVE THE OFTEN DA'S OF SOME COMFORT LEVEL THAT IS PROGRAMS -- DO ACTUALLY WORK WITH THAT I RECOMMEND AYE VOTE. MET MAVERICK WERE MORE COMMON.

I WAS GONNA SAY ANYTHING. I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU WERE RIGHT I WAS HOPING PROBABLY [inaudible] NO. ONE AGAIN GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM HERE TO PROUDLY PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL. SEVENTEEN SIXTY FOUR WHICH WILL PROVIDE REDRESS TO PEOPLE WHO WERE INVOLUNTARILY STERILIZED UNDER CALIFORNIA'S PREVIOUS EUGENICS LAWS. THAT WERE IN EFFECT FROM NINETEEN OH NINE TO NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE THIS BILL PROVIDES MATERIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THIS INJUSTICE BY CREATING THE FOR STERILIZATION COMPENSATION PROGRAM. IN NINETEEN OH NINE THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATORS APPROVED LEGISLATION AUTHORIZING MEDICAL SUPERINTENDENT. OF STATE HOMES AND HOSPITALS TO STERILIZE PATIENTS THEY DEEMED. UNFIT FOR REPRODUCTION. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. ON FITS FOR REPRODUCTION. CALIFORNIA WENT ON TO ADMINISTER THE MOST ADVICE THE MOST. ADVISED THE EUGENICS STERILIZATION PROGRAM IN THE NATION. ADVANCED EUGENICS STERILIZATION PROGRAM IN THE NATION STERILIZING MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES LATINOS AND POOR PEOPLE WERE THE MOST TARGETED AND HARM BY EUGENICS STERILIZATION. THE AVERAGE AGE OF STERILIZATION WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. THIS LAW WAS NOT REPEALED UNTIL. NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE THE YEAR BEFORE I WAS BORN. EUGENICS STERILIZATION PROGRAMS ARE NOW RECOGNIZED AS A MAJOR HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE. IN TWO THOUSAND THREE GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS IN THE STATE OF AND THE SENATE SEPARATELY APOLOGIZE FOR CALIFORNIA'S EUGENICS STERILIZATION PROGRAM ANY FORM OF REDRESS HOWEVER DID NOT ACCOMPANY. THEIR APOLOGIES AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY FOUR PROVIDES MONETARY COMPENSATION OF SURVIVORS OF STERILIZATION UNDER THE STATE'S PREVIOUS EUGENICS LAWS. THAT WERE IN EFFECT AGAIN FROM. NINETEEN OH NINE TO NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE REGRETTABLY THERE ARE TWO ADDITIONAL KNOWN PERIODS OF INVOLUNTARY STERILIZATIONS WITH A BEAT -- SEVENTEEN SIXTY FOUR WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE WOMEN OF MEXICAN ORIGIN WHO DELIVERED BABIES AT LA COUNTY USC MEDICAL CENTER BETWEEN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND FEMALE INMATES IN CALIFORNIA STATE PRISONS WHO WERE STERILIZED WITHOUT PROPER AUTHORIZATION. FROM 200-062-00010. THAT WAS DURING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S ADMINISTRATION. TWO THOUSAND SIX IN TWO THOUSAND TEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT A WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE ALSO INCLUDES THE CHOICE. OF BEING MOTHERS. THE CHOICE OF HAVING CHILDREN. AND THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE RECTIFY THAT WRONG. HEARING ME TO TESTIFY IS CAROLYN MEYER'S WITH THE DISABILITY RIGHTS EDUCATION AND DEFENSE FUND AND KELLY DILLON WHO WILL SPEAK ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL. SALAS ANOTHER WITNESS. AND YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES YOU CAN [inaudible] PARTIAL OUT. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CARLY MYERS AND I'M A STAFF ATTORNEY WITH THE DISABILITY RIGHTS EDUCATION AND DEFENSE FUND A NATIONAL DISABILITY LAW AND POLICY CENTER THAT PROTECTS IN ADVANCE IS THE CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS. OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AS AN ORGANIZATION COMMITTED TO PROMOTING A QUALITY IN ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY FOUR IN BELIEVE IT PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN ADVANCING DISABILITY AND REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE. BETWEEN NINETEEN OH NINE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE AT LEAST TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WERE INVOLUNTARILY STERILIZED AT THE HANDS OF THE STATE. BASED ON IN ACCURATE IN MISGUIDED ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT DISABILITY PEOPLE WERE LABELLED QUOTE MORON IN MISSILE OR MENTALLY DEFECTIVE AND THEY WERE SUMMARILY STERILIZED. CALIFORNIA'S EUGENICS STERILIZATION LAW WAS ONE OF SEVERAL LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT ON ITS FACE TARGETED PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND IN PRACTICE HAD A DISPARATE IMPACT ON PEOPLE OF COLOR WOMEN AND POOR PEOPLE. THE U. S. SUPREME COURT'S INFAMOUS DECISION AND BUCK V. BELL PERHAPS BEST SUMMARIZES THE HORRIFIC REASONING BEHIND THE STERILIZATION LAWS. IN THE SHAMEFUL WORDS OF JUSTICE HOLMES QUOTE IT IS BETTER FOR ALL THE WORLD IF INSTEAD OF WAITING TO EXECUTE DEGENERATE OFFSPRING FOR CRIME OR LET THEM STARVE FOR THEIR IMBECILITY. SOCIETY CAN PREVENT THOSE WHO ARE MANIFESTLY UNFIT FROM BREEDING THE KINDS. THREE GENERATIONS OF IN THE SILENCE ARE ENOUGH END QUOTE. WHILE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REPEALED ITS EUGENICS LAW INNINETEEN SEVENTY NINE ITS STERILIZATION ABUSES CONTINUED. AFTER NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE AND AS RECENTLY AS TWENTY TEN AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY WOMEN WERE STERILIZED WITHOUT PROPER CONSENT IN CALIFORNIA STATE PRISONS. THESE WOMEN WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY WOMEN OF COLOR AND MONOLINGUAL SPANISH SPEAKERS MANY DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT THEY WERE BEING STERILIZED. CALIFORNIA NOW HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DENOUNCE EUGENICS AND COVERS A PRISON STERILIZATIONS FOR WHAT THEY WERE A FLAGRANT HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE. IN RECOGNITION OF THE LASTING HARMS THAT THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS INJURED AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY FOUR WILL PROVIDE SURVIVING INDIVIDUALS WITH MONETARY COMPENSATION. AND IT WILL RAISE PUBLIC AWARENESS ABOUT THE DISCRIMINATORY DISCRIMINATORY HARMS THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS FACED. THROUGH THESE MATERIAL ACTIONS A PIECE AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY FOUR RECOGNIZES THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL TO CONTROL THEIR OWN REPRODUCTIVE CAPACITY. ID KNOWLEDGES THAT STEREO TYPES AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND CAPACITIES OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE NEVER LEGITIMATE FACTORS IN EVALUATING WHAT IS MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE TREATMENT. ENDS IT AFFIRMS THAT ALL PEOPLE SHOULD BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT REGARDING THEIR LIVES IN REPRODUCTION INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES PEOPLE OF COLOR PEOPLE WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS AND OTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN FOR THESE REASONS THE DISABILITY RIGHTS EDUCATION AND DEFENSE FUND RESPECTFULLY ASKS FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY FOUR THANK YOU THANK YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES LEFT GO.

THAT'S BEEN DONE TO THE WOMEN IN WOMEN'S PRISONS IN ALL OF THE VICTIMS OF FORCED.

YOUR LAST TO TO SUPPORT WITH NO FOR FORMAL OPPOSITION. WELL GOOD MORNING A STILL MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PRESENTING A. B. TWO FOUR THREE WHICH WILL REQUIRE PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS. TRAINING ALSO KNOWN AS POST TO TRAIN PEACE OFFICERS AVAIL. SEC THANK YOU AN IMPLICIT BIAS EVERY TWO YEARS RATHER THAN THE CURRENT. FIVE SUFFICE IT TO SAY EVERYONE HAS IMPLICIT BIAS EVERYONE IS BY. INCLUDING MYSELF AND LICENSE I'M PART OF THE HUMAN RACE YES UNCONSCIOUS AN IMPLICIT BIAS THESE CAN AND DO AFFECT THE DAY TO DAY DECISION MAKING PROCESS THESE OF EVEN THE MOST FAIR MINDED PEACE OFFICERS. YET MORE AWARENESS CAN COME THROUGH EDUCATION INTERACTION AND CONVERSATION. TO BE CLEAR IMPLICIT BIASES THE UNCONSCIOUS OR UNINTENTIONAL MENTAL SHORTCUT THAT HUMAN BEINGS DEVELOP IS OFTEN THE SUBTLE ASSOCIATIONS WE MAKE BETWEEN GROUPS OF PEOPLE AND STEREO TYPES ABOUT THOSE GROUPS. DESPITE PEOPLE'S BEST INTENTIONS RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT SUBJECTSCAN CONSCIOUSLY EMBRACE IDEAS OF FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY AND YET ON TESTS THAT MEASURE SUBCONSCIOUS TENDENCIES STILL SHOW A STRONG PROPENSITY TO LEAN ON STEREO TYPES TO FILL IN THE BLANKS. ABOUT PEOPLE THEY DON'T KNOW. IT IS CRITICAL THAT PEACE OFFICERS RECEIVE MORE TRAINING ON A ROUTINE BASIS TO RECOGNIZE THEIR IMPLICIT BIAS SEES AND TO TAKE STEPS TO COUNTERACT THEIR UNCONSCIOUS INFLUENCES. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WIELD AUTHORITY AND THIS OBLIGATES THEM TO BETTER COMBAT THERE BY CITIES RESEARCHERS AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY EXAMINED ALMOST ONE HUNDRED MILLION TRAFFIC STOPS. FROM TWENTY ELEVEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN ACROSS TWENTY ONE STATE PAROLE AGENCIES INCLUDING HIGH THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL AND MUNICIPAL. POLICE DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING BAKERSFIELD SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN DIEGO AND FOUND THAT BLACK AND LATINO DRIVERS WERE STOPPED MORE OFTEN THAN WHITE DRIVERS BASED ON LESS EVIDENCE OF WRONGDOING. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS RECOGNIZED THIS AND TAKEN IN SUPPORT AND STEPS TO DEAL WITH IMPLICIT BIAS THAT AFFECTS OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. I WOULD LIKE TO BUILD A CULTURE THAT CONSTANTLY AND RESPECTFULLY ADDRESSES BIAS TO STRENGTHEN THE TRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OUR COMMUNITIES. AB TWO FOUR THREE SIX TO AMPLIFY THE DOJ'S WORK ON IMPLICIT BIAS AND MANDATE THAT PEACE OFFICERS MUST BE TRAINED EVERY TWO YEARS. TODAY WITH ME AND SUPPORT IS KIMBERLY PAPPY ON JUDICIAL PROFESSOR AND LISA HOLDER EQUAL JUSTICE SOCIETY LEGAL DIRECTOR THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M LISA HOLDER CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY. I ALSO TEACH A CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING AT UCLA LAW SCHOOL. AND I ADDRESSED YOU HERE TODAY IN MY CAPACITY AS INTERIM LEGAL DIRECTOR FOR THE EQUAL JUSTICE SOCIETY AND OAKLAND OAKLAND BASED RACIAL JUSTICE ADVOCACY GROUP. I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO BE HERE ADDRESSING THIS AUGUST BODY OF LAWMAKERS. FOR TWENTY YEARS SINCE ITS INCEPTION THE EQUAL JUSTICE SOCIETY HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING ANALYZING AND RESEARCHING IMPLICIT BIAS. AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE IMPLICIT UNCONSCIOUS BIAS. AND THOSE BY ASSERTIVE DEVELOPED DURING THE COURSE OF A LIFETIME THROUGH EXPOSURE. TO STEREOTYPES. IMPLICIT BIAS INFLUENCES OUR JUDGMENTS. OUR ATTITUDES AND OUR ACTIONS TOWARD OTHER PEOPLE. AND IT'S VERY HARD FOR PEOPLE TO ACCEPT THAT THEY HAVE IMPLICIT BIAS BECAUSE IT OFTEN RUNS COUNTER TO THEIR CONSCIOUS VALUES. POLICE OFFICERS ARE NOT IMMUNE FROM. IMPLICIT BIAS. STUDIES DATING BACK TO AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND ONE WHEN PRIME TO WITH PHOTOS OF BLACK FACES. JUST LIKE CIVILIANS POLICE OFFICERS ARE CONSISTENTLY MORE LIKELY TO ASSOCIATE BLACK FACES WITH CRIMINALITY. TO MISS IDENTIFY COMMON OBJECTS AS WEAPONS AFTER BEING SHOWN PHOTOS OF BLACK FACES. AND TO LABEL PHOTOS OF BLACK PEOPLE AS THREATENING. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUST GAVE US STATISTICS ABOUT HOW WHEN LEFT UNDERAGE UNADDRESSED. IMPLICIT BIASES OF POLICE OFFICERS CONTRIBUTE TO STAGGER STAGGERING RACIAL DISPARITIES IN POLICING. SINCE BIAS IS LEARNED OVER A LIFETIME. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO UNLEARN OUR BIAS. HOWEVER THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WITH INTENSIVE. SYSTEMATIC INTERVENTIONS CHANGE IS POSSIBLE. ENTER BIAS TRAINING. PROVIDES PRACTICAL TOOLS TO HELP PARTICIPANTS RETRAIN THE BRAIN TO DESTRUCT STEREO TYPE BASED. IMPLICIT ASSOCIATIONS AND TO MANAGE BIAS. COUNTER BIAS TRAINING IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE MUST BE ONGOING AND RE OCCURRING. ONE CRITICAL COMPONENT OF AB. TWO FORTY THREE IS THAT IT REQUIRES EIGHT HOURS OF SYSTEMIC REOCCURRING TRAINING EVERY TWO YEARS. AND THIS WOULD APPLY TO THE TRAIN THE TRAINER PROGRAM IN POST. THE POLICE OFFICER TRAINING AS WELL. AND E. J. S. STRONGLY SUPPORT AB TWO FORTY THREE AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR YES VOTE. THANK YOU. YES -- HELLO THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME CHAIR IN A STAIN MEMBERS MY NAME IS -- EIGHT KIMBERLY POPPY OWN AND I AM A JUDICIAL PROFESSOR -- I TEACH NEUROSCIENCE THE LAW AND DECISION MAKING -- AT WHAT WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT WITH REGARD TO IMPLICIT BIAS IS THE CON ARE THE CONCEPTS AROUND PSYCHOLOGY BUT TECHNOLOGY HAS GIVEN US A GREAT DEAL OF INSIGHT INTO THE NEURAL CORRELATES. OF IMPLICIT BIAS -- WE ARE NOW CLEARLY. ABLE TO SAY THAT THERE ARE INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN LOWER ONCE LEVEL OF IMPLICIT BIAS. IF TAUGHT PROPERLY IN A CLASSROOM CAN CHANGE PROBLEMATIC BRAIN REACTIONS THAT CAUSE PEOPLE TO MAKE CERTAIN TYPES OF DECISIONS. AND CAN ACTUALLY ALTER DECISION MAKING SO THAT PEOPLE MAKE BEER AND ACCURATE DECISIONS -- THERE ARE PARTS OF OUR BRAIN THAT ACTUALLY WILL ACTIVATE WHEN WE SEE A SPIDER OR SNAKE. IF YOU HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF IMPLICIT BIAS FOR INSTANCE TOWARDS AFRICAN AMERICANS THAT SAME PART OF YOUR BRAIN WILL ACTIVATE THAT SPIDER SNAKE LIKE REACTION FOR FEAR. DISTRUST THREAT EXCITING WILL TURN ON MORE WHEN YOU SEE A FACE THAT LOOKS FAR MORE LIKE SHAQUILLE O'NEAL THAN MATT DAMON -- THAT'S PROBLEMATIC WE HAVE OUR PEACE OFFICERS OUT THERE TRYING TO ASSESS THREAT ON THE STREET. THAT SAME NOTION OF IMPLICIT BIAS ALSO AFFECTS THE DETERMINATION TO SHOOT OR NOT SHOOT WHEN TRYING TO ASSESS WHAT'S IN SOMEONE'S HANDS. A NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE SHOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT AN AFRICAN AMERICAN TROOP AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN HOLDING A WALLET -- BUT WILL BE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE AN A TEST ACTUALLY HAVE SOMEBODY DECIDE DO I SHOULD THIS PERSON OR NOT SHOULD THIS PERSON. AND COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION THAT AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN HOLDING A WALLET WILL BE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE THE DECISION OF SHOOT THAT IS AN ANGLO AMERICAN COUNTERPART HOLDING A GUN. WE CAN CHANGE THAT REACTION IN TRAINING. FINALLY THE LEVEL OF IMPLICIT BIAS IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE LEVEL OF PHYSICAL PHYSIOLOGIC PAIN EMPATHY. THAT INDIVIDUALS FEEL. THAT CAN HAVE A DIRECT EFFECT ON HOW POLICE OFFICERS PURSUE INVESTIGATIONS AND AND IDENTIFY AND SPEAK TO WITNESSES. SO WE KNOW THAT THE SCIENCE HAS GIVEN US THE ANSWERS THAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THESE BRAIN REACTIONS CHANGE THIS DECISION MAKING PROCESS. CHANGE THE LEVEL OF IMPLICIT BIAS AND THEREBY CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF EQUITY. IN THE POLICING PROCESS. A GOOD CLASS WILL DO MORE THAN HOLD HANDS AND SING COME BY ALL. A GOOD CLASS WILL ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL HELP MOVE THE PROCESS FORWARD. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NAME AN ORGANIZATION. DANIEL SAVANNAH ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES ALSO IN SUPPORT. DANIEL TEARS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN SUPPORT.

IT'S REACHED WICKS I JUST WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FOR ALLOWING ME TO CALL FOR THE BILL -- I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE I THINK AS NOTED YOU KNOW WE ALL HAVE IMPLICIT BIAS -- AND WHEN WE HAVE THAT IN THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IT'S PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC. AND THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DEAL WITH THIS IS TO DISCUSS SAID ADDRESS IT PROVIDE TRAINING FOR IT -- AND DEAL WITH IT HEAD ON TO TRY TO REBUILD THAT TRUST SO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TO CALL FOR THIS AND I WILL OBVIOUSLY. PROBABLY BE VOTING FOR THIS. THANK YOU YOU MAY CLOSE.

THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER -- WE'RE HERE PRESENT AB TWELVE FIFTEEN WHICH WOULD BE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND OFFICIALS. FROM USING -- INSTALLING OR ACTIVATING FACIAL RECOGNITION AND BIOMETRIC SCANNERS AND BODY CAMERAS. LET ME JUST FIRST THANK THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE -- FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND ADVICE AND WE ARE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO REMOVE THE PROVISION ON DAMAGES -- WE ARE -- PROACTIVELY RESPONDING TO THE PUBLIC'S CONCERNS OVER -- POLICE INVOLVED SHOOTINGS AGENCIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY INSTALLING BODY CAMERA -- PROGRAM. WE WANT TO BE PRO ACTIVE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE OFFICIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE INSTALLED. IN THOSE CAMERAS AT THIS POINT -- RIGHT NOW THE SOFTWARE IS ACTUALLY VERY FAULTY IN FACT -- AMAZON BREAK FAMILIES ON'S RECOGNITION SYSTEM FALSE IDENTIFIED TWENTY EIGHT SITTING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. AS PEOPLE IN A MUGSHOT DATABASE. WITH MEMBERS OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY MISIDENTIFIED ALONG ONE OF OUR FORMER COLLEAGUES CONGRESS SHOULD BE GOMEZ WAS OR ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WRONGLY IDENTIFIED. SO GET A. B. TWELVE FIFTEEN WE SEEK. UP FURTHER PRESENT MISTRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE PUBLIC BY PRO ACTIVELY ENSURING THAT FACIAL RECOGNIZABLE CAN'T BE INSTALLED AND BODY CAMERAS WITH A WITH FEW WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MATT CABLE AND I'M AN ATTORNEY AT THE ACLU OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA -- WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB TWELVE FIFTEEN THE BODY CAMERA ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. OF THIS BILL SUPPORTED BY A BROAD CIVIL RIGHTS COALITION. THIS BILL CODIFIES CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS BY PREVENTING THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION AND OTHER BIOMETRIC SURVEILLANCE WITH OFFICER. BODY CAMERAS ADDING FACE RECOGNITION TO A BODY CAMERA WOULD BE LIKE REQUIRING EVERYONE TO CONSTANTLY SHOW A PHOTO ID TO POLICE WITHOUT ANY SUSPICION. OF WRONGDOING WHATSOEVER AND IN THE FACE RECOGNITION DATABASES BREACHED WE CANNOT RESET OUR FACES LIKE WE CAN'T A PASSWORD ON AN ONLINE ACCOUNT. THIS BILL RECOGNIZES THAT CALIFORNIANS WERE PROMISED BODY CAMERAS AS A TOOL TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC NOT AS AN ADDITIONAL PROSECUTORIAL SYSTEM FOR THE POLICE TO IDENTIFY. AND TRACK CALIFORNIANS 62% OF LIKELY TWENTY TWENTY VOTERS AGREE THAT BODY CAMERA SHOULD BE USED SOLELY TO RECORD HOW POLICE TREAT THE PUBLIC AND PROVIDE A TOOL OF ACCOUNTABILITY. NOT FOR SURVEILLANCE. THIS BILL ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT RESEARCH BY -- FOLKS AT MIT SHOWING THAT FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE IS LESS ACCURATE AND ACTUALLY BIASED AGAINST WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. BODY MAKE CAMERA MAKER AXON HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THE SHORTCOMINGS AND JUST LAST WEEK WE HEARD THAT MICROSOFT REFUSED TO SELL FACIAL RECOGNITION TO A CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. BECAUSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS AND ACCURACY ISSUES. SO IF A FACE SURVEILLANCE -- IS PUT ONTO A BODY CAMERA POLICE MAIN GAUGE OR USE FORCE WITH POTENTIALLY TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES. FEAR OF MISIDENTIFICATION WILL ALSO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM SEEKING HELP FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT OR OFFERING ASSISTANCE -- FACE SURROUNDS A BODY CAMERAS TO MAKE US LESS SAFE. AND COMPANIES ARE RUSHING TO DO IT THE PLAY THIS RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S WHY THIS LEGISLATION IS TIMELY AND NECESSARY TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. THIS LEGISLATION ALSO PRESERVES THE STATUS QUO. AS WE ARE NOT AWARE OF A CALIFORNIA AGENCY CURRENTLY USING THE TECHNOLOGY IN THIS DANGEROUS WAY CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA. WE URGE YOU TO VOTE HI ON TWELVE FIFTEEN AND THANK YOU. YES. THANK YOU UP MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE MY NAME IS STEVEN ANDTHAT -- SO I'M THE SENIOR CAMPAIGNS DIRECTOR AT THE CENTER FOR MEDIA JUSTICE WHERE A DIGITAL CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION BASED IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA -- WE ARE HERE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF AB TWELVE FIFTY THE BODY CAMERA ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. THIS SENSIBLE PIECE OF LEGISLATION RECOGNIZES THAT THE RIGHT TO FEEL SAFE SHOULDN'T COME AT THE EXPENSE OF ON CHECK SURVEILLANCE. CALIFORNIANS FROM SACRAMENTO TO SAN DIEGO -- HAD BEEN DEMANDING GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY FROM ITS LOCAL POLICE ARE COMMUNITIES WERE SOLD ON THE IDEA THAT BODY CAMERAS WOULD DELIVER SAFETY FOR EVERYONE. AND WHILE WE CAN DEBATE WHETHER THESE DEVICES HAVE LIVED UP TO THEIR PROMISE ONE THING IS CLEAR. FACIAL RECOGNITION WOULD TURN THESE INSTRUMENTS INTO CAMP THESE CAMERAS INTO INSTRUMENTS OF INJUSTICE. HERE THREE REASONS THAT WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS NECESSARY ONE FACIAL RECOGNITION WOULD EXPAND THE REACH AND POWER OF POLICE DEPARTMENTS TURNING THE CURRENT BODY ONE CAMERAS OUT IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND TO ROVING SURVEILLANCE NETWORKS. THIS TECH WOULD INCREASE MISTRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALREADY OVER POLICED AND THREE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THE TECHNOLOGY TO BE AN ACCURATE AND BIAS PARTICULARLY TOWARDS PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND WOMEN. ALLEN BY JUST QUOTING BELL HOOKS YOU SAID THAT WHEN YOU ARE THIRSTY YOU WANT WATER IT DOES NOT MATTER IN THAT MOMENT WHETHER IT'S DIRTY OR CLEAN SAFETY IS THAT WATER THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE THIRSTY FOR AS LEADERS IN THE STATE UNITS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A DRINK FOR THIRST. THIS LEGISLATION IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO PUBLIC SAFETY THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF US AND WE URGE YOU TO VOTE I ON A. B. TWELVE FIFTEEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS WHO SHALL MUCH LOWER ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY OPPOSING AB -- TWELVE FIFTEEN FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE WE ARE OF AB VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE REMOVING -- TOOLS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY PROTECT THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND EIGHT INVESTIGATIONS IF THERE ARE JUSTIFIABLE CONCERNS ABOUT PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGIES AND THEIR USAGE DISCUSSIONS AMONG LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND AGENCIES EVEN STAKEHOLDERS CAN BE HAD HOWEVER TO IMPOSE A BLANKET BAN ON PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY LIMITS LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFICACY AND RESTRICT HIS ABILITY TO MEET THIS INVESTIGATOR TERRY AND CRIME PREVENTION AND SOLVING MAN DAYS.

THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE ITEM NUMBER. TWENTY EIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT A. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE TODAY THIS BILL WORKS TO ADDRESS. DATA GAPS AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA BY ESTABLISHING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND INCREASING DATA TRANSPARENCY CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S CRIMINAL RECORDS DO NOT PAINT THE WHOLE PICTURE MISSING INFORMATION. AND INACCURACIES IN DATA UNDERMINE THE AFFAIR ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AND OUR ABILITY AS LAWMAKERS TO MAKE EFFECTIVE POLICIES. A. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE WAS SET CLEAR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR LOCAL AND STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND COURTS AMONG OTHER CRITERIA THIS INCLUDES A PERSON'S IDENTIFYING INFORMATION CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AND IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. ARREST CHARGE DISPOSITION PROBATION PAROLE SENSING INFORMATION AT SUCH UP WITH THESE MULTIPLE DATA POINTS WE WILL BETTER BE ABLE. TO IMPLEMENT A FAIR AND SAFE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND BE ABLE TO COMPARE CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PROGRAMS AND TO CONSIDER NEW ONES. IF WE DO NOT HAVE ACCURATE AND RELIABLE DATA ON WHAT A PERSON HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF OR WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CASE THEN WE CAN'T. MAKE APPROPRIATE DECISIONS REGARDING BAYLOR DIVERSION PROGRAMS OR CREATE ACCURATE CRIMINAL RECORDS THAT WILL IMPACT IN THE AN INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO OBTAIN EMPLOYMENT OR SECURE HOUSING. FOR SERIOUS ABOUT FIXING ARE FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WE MUST START AT THE FOUNDATIONAL LEVA LEVEL. IN THIS CASE WITH GOOD DATA A. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE IS THE FIRST STEP IN ENSURING WE HAVE RELIABLE AND COMPLETE CRIMINAL JUSTICE. DATA I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE MARIA MCKEE SAM JUST GO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE MAKAYLA RABINOWITZ NATIONAL ENGAGEMENT. AND FIELD OPERATIONS AND ALICIA AKAN TODD SAM CISCO PRE TRIAL DIVERSION PROJECT. JUST AS A FRIENDLY REMINDER WILL GIVE YOU FIVE MINUTES YOU CAN DIVIDE THAT UP AS YOU SEE FIT. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MARIA CAM THE PRINCIPAL ANALYST AT THE SAN FRANCISCO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FIRST I'D LIKE TO THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR HIS ADVOCACY ON THIS IMPORTANT AND OFTEN OVERLOOKED ISSUE. AND THANK YOU ALSO TO THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. INCREASINGLY IN THE DIGITAL AGE THE COLLECTION REPORTING ANALYSIS AND TRANSPARENCY OF DATA ARE CENTRAL TO GOOD GOVERNANCE. AND THAT'S WHAT AB THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE IS ALL ABOUT GOOD GOVERNANCE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE THE LEGISLATURE HAS RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING THE UNIFORMITY FISHING COLLECTION AND DISSEMINATION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE YET TO ACHIEVE THAT VISION AND CALIFORNIA'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA IS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE. THIS HAS MAJOR CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR STATE FIRST THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA GAP IS BAD FOR PUBLIC SAFETY FOR EXAMPLE THE BUREAU OF FIREARMS DEPENDS ON THE TIMELY REPORTING OF CAMP OF CONVICTION INFORMATION. TO ENSURE THAT PROHIBITED PERSONS SUCH AS DOMESTIC OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OFFENDERS DO NOT POSSESS OR ACQUIRE GUNS. SECOND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA GAP IS BAD FOR GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY IN GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY IS ACCOUNTABILITY CURRENTLY TOO MANY ASPECTS OF THE CRIMINAL PROCESS ARE HIDDEN FROM VIEW FROM VIEW WHICH BREEDS DISTRESSED. THIRD THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA GAP IS BAD FOR PUBLIC POLICY. I WOULD CONTEND THAT EVERY BILL BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE SUFFERS FROM A LACK OF SUFFICIENT DATA TO PROJECT ITS IMPACT AND ESTIMATE THE COST. IN TRYING TO MEASURE RACIAL DISPARITIES ASSOCIATED WITH DEATH SENTENCES WE ARE LIMITED BY THE DATA GAP. IN ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF EARLY DISCHARGE FROM POST RELEASE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION WE ARE LIMITED BY THE DATA GAP. IN MEASURING RECIDIVISM ASSOCIATED WITH CDC OUR PROGRAMMING WE ARE LIMITED BY THE DATA GAP. AB THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE WILL ADDRESS THESE GAPS HE CLARIFIES WHAT HOW AND BY WHOM CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA SHOULD BE REPORTED TO THE STATE. IT ENSURES THAT RAPSHEETS HAVE TIMELY INCOMPLETE INFORMATION SO THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CAN DO THEIR JOBS. AND ENSURES THAT THIS DATA IS AVAILABLE TO GOVERNMENT STAKEHOLDERS INDEPENDENT RESEARCHERS AND THE PUBLIC SO THAT WE CAN ALL MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. FOR THESE REASONS I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA IMPROVEMENT ACT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MAKAYLA RABINOWITZ I'M THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL ENGAGEMENT AND FIELD OPERATIONS AT MEASURES FOR JUSTICE A NON PARTISAN NATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE RESEARCH ORGANIZATION. I'M ALSO THE LEAD AUTHOR IN PARTNERSHIP WITH STANFORD LAW SCHOOL OF A REPORT CALLED THE CALIFORNIA CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA GAP THE DETAILS MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS. I WOULD LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. FOR CHAMPIONING FOR CHAMPIONING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND THE COMMITTEE FOR TAKING THE TIME TO CONSIDER TODAY. ON ITS FACE THIS ISSUE IS MUCH LESS COMPELLING THAN MANY OF THE OF MANY OF THE OTHER IMPORTANT PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES THAT THE LEGISLATURE TAKES UP. BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT HIGH QUALITY CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA IS ACTUALLY THE LYNCH PIN THAT IS NECESSARY FOR THE SUCCESS ALL OF THESE OTHER INITIATIVES. IF THE STATE DOES NOT EXIST IF IT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO POLICY MAKERS PRACTITIONERS RESEARCHERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC THERE'S NO WAY TO IDENTIFY OUR MOST CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUES. NOR TO MONITOR OR EVALUATE OUR RESPONSES. OVER THE PAST DECADE CALIFORNIA HAS PASSED AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF LAWS THAT HAVE CRITICALLY ALTERED CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY AND PRACTICE. LEGISLATION LIKE AB ONE OH NINE SB TEN AND SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN COUPLED WITH BALLOT INITIATIVE LIKE PROP 47-57 ARE SHIFTING THE FACE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND PUBLIC SAFETY IN CALIFORNIA. AND YET ALMOST A DECADE AFTER PUBLIC SAFETY REALIGNMENT SPARKED THIS ONGOING SERIES OF REFORMS WE LACK THE DATA NECESSARY TO TRACK THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE CHANGES WERE TO MEASURE THEIR IMPACT. THIS IS ESPECIALLY CONCERNING GIVEN THAT MANY OF THESE NEW LAWS ARE STILL BEING CONTESTED WITH BALLOT INITIATIVES PENDING A TO ROLL BACK BOTH BILL REFORM AND PROP. FORTY SEVEN BECAUSE BOTH PROPONENTS AND AND AND OPPONENTS OF THESE LAWS LACK THE DATA TO ASSESS THEIR IMPLEMENTATION WE'RE IN SAID FORCED TO MAKE CRITICAL CHOICES BASED ON ANECDOTE OFTEN WITH EXTREME EXAMPLES THAT DON'T REFLECT PREVAILING PATTERNS. SIMILARLY YOU AS LEGISLATORS ARE FORCED TO TAKE UP POSITIONS AND VOTE ON CRITICAL PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES AFFECTING OUR STATE WITHOUT THE REQUISITE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION. WITHOUT HIGH QUALITY CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA THAT IS ACCESSIBLE TO POLICY MAKERS PRACTITIONERS RESEARCHERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC WE CANNOT ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS AND WE CANNOT MAKE INFORMED POLICY. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS A LEASE HELPING TERATOMA VIC I'M CHIEF PROGRAMME OFFICER SAN FRANCISCO PRE TRIAL DIVERSION PROJECT. WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT HAS PROVIDED PRE TRIAL SERVICES TO THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO SINCE. NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX AND WHILE WE PROVIDE A SPECTRUM OF PRE TRIAL SERVICES ONE OF OUR MAIN ROLES IS TO PROVIDE TO THE COURT TIMELY AND ACCURATE PROCESSING. OF CRIMINAL HISTORY DATA FOR PRE TRIAL RELEASE DECISION MAKING. A IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ANOTHER LOCAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE STAKEHOLDERS AS A PRE TRIAL IMPLEMENTED THE PUBLIC SAFETY ASSESSMENT OR THE PSA TOOL IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE PSA USES AN ALGORITHM THAT DERIVES A RIFF SCORE FROM BOTH STATIC AND DYNAMIC FACTORS INCLUDING THE INDIVIDUALS AGE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CURRENT CHARGING INFORMATION ABOUT CONVICTIONS AND COURT APPEARANCE FOUND IN THE INDIVIDUAL'S CRIMINAL HISTORY. WELL AS A PRE TRIAL HAS CONSISTENTLY SCORED OVER 90% ACCURACY RATES ON THE PSA VALUATIONS CONDUCTED BY OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE PARTNERS. WE HAVE FOUND THAT RAPSHEETS IN CALIFORNIA ARE CONSISTENTLY MISSING DATA INTEGRAL TO THE ACCURATE COMPLETION OF THE PSA INFORMATION SUCH AS CASE DISPOSITION OR CONVICTIONS FAILURES TO APPEAR AND SENTENCING INFORMATION. BECAUSE OF THESE GAPS IN THE DATA OUR TEAM UTILIZE A SYSTEM OF PHONE FAX AN ONLINE INVESTIGATIONS REACHING OUT TO OTHER COUNTIES TO COLLECT DATA MISSING FROM THE CALIFORNIA RAP SHEET. THIS WORK AROUND IS NOT ONLY INEFFICIENT BUT IT CAN LEAD TO DISPARATE OUTCOMES IF SOME AGENCIES ARE COUNTIES ARE MORE OR LESS LIKELY TO REPORT ESSENTIAL DATA POINTS. THIS IS BECAUSE EACH DATA POINT AFFECTS THE RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL AND MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE IN INDIVIDUALS LIKELIHOOD OF RELEASED DEPENDING ON THE DATA REPORTED. SO CONSISTENT AND RELIABLE CRIMINAL HISTORY REPORTING PRACTICES ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY BY ENSURING EQUITABLE AND FAIR ACCESS TO JUSTICE. PROCEDURAL JUSTICE THEORY TELLS US THAT THE PERCEPTION OF FAIRNESS OF PROCESS THROUGH TRANSPARENCY AND COMMUNICATION LEADS TO INCREASED ACCEPTANCE OF OUTCOMES EVEN NOW COMES NOT NECESSARILY FAVORABLE TO THE DEFENDANT. THIS ACCEPTANCE MEANS MORE COMPLIANCE WITH COURT ORDERS AND LESS INSTANCES OF RECIDIVISM. WE SUPPORT BROAD REFORM IN PRE TRIAL RELEASE PRACTICES AND BELIEVE THE INDEPENDENT SAN FRANCISCO MODEL TO BE A BENCHMARK FOR EQUITABLE AND FAIR PRE TRIAL SYSTEMS. BUT IF THE USE OF RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS WILL BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO PRE TRIAL RELEASE DECISION MAKING OR AS A DETERMINANT IN IMMEDIATE ATTENTION DECISIONS AS OUTLINED IN SB. TEN THEN WE NEED COMPARABLE MACHINE READABLE AND COMPLETE BEGINNER. PERMISSION YES TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND ACCURACY IN THE PRE TRIAL PROCESS BY PROVIDING A POTENTIAL FOR AUTOMATION AND REDUCING THE NEED FOR SOME PERSON WORKER. THE BILL. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN. SUPPORT. NAME AN ORGANIZATION. AND WOOD LITTLE WITH CALIFORNIA'S FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. IT WASN'T SUPPORT ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. COULD YOU MAKE ROOM FOR THE SHARE. MIKE THANK YOU I'M ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RECORD SUPERVISORS WITNESS RESPECTFULLY. OPPOSE THIS MEASURE -- I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND DOWN -- WE BELIEVE THAT THE GOALS OF THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION ALREADY CALM PLACE BY REQUIREMENTS UNDER EXISTING LAW -- CURRENTLY UNDER -- DIRECTION OF THE DOJ LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY ARE ARE YOU REQUIRED TO FILL OUT ITEMIZED REPORTS AND SUBMIT THE DATA TO THE MONTHLY ARRESTS AND CITATION REGISTER. AND WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT IT DITION ALL AB RELEVANT OR USEFUL CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA WOULD BE GAINED BY REQUIRING ANOTHER WEEKLY ITEMIZED REPORT I WOULD SAY THAT -- WE ARE AT AS THEY MENTIONED IT IS GREAT TO GET DATA AND HOW WE ARE AS GOOD AS THE DATA THAT WE RECEIVE SO WHY NOT -- ACTUALLY EXPEND A RESOURCES AND ENERGY ON MAKING SURE THAT DO THOSE WHO HAVE TO REPORT TO STATE A HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO IT PROPERLY SO THAT WE GET THE APPROPRIATE DATA SO WE CAN MAKE APPROPRIATE DECISIONS SO I THINK I WE SHOULD ACTUALLY START FROM THE BEGINNING. INSTEAD OF TRYING TO CREATE MORE AND MANDATES AND PROCESSES OFFERED HIS REASONS RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOU KNOW VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] ANY OTHER. IN OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND YOU MAY CLOSE MISTER BONTA AND HOPE FOR YOU CAN ADDRESS. WHAT THE OPPOSITION SURE? WELL THE I MEAN THERE'S A REPORT THAT JUST CAME OUT CALL THE CALIFORNIA CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA GAP WHAT'S IRATE MY STAFF AT LAW SCHOOL AND MISTER BENNETT MUCH RIGHT HERE THAT. SAYS THE EXACT OPPOSITE THAT THE DATA IS NOT COMPLETE IT'S NOT THOROUGH IT'S NOT COMPREHENSIVE IT'S INADEQUATE THERE'S GAPS IN IT. THAT LEAD TO PUBLIC SAFETY CHALLENGES THAT LEAD. TO IN JUSTICE FOR INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE DATA IS OLDER NOT UPDATED OR INCOMPLETE. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE HEARD FROM ALL. OF VOICES IN IN THE DISCUSSION HERE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT TO REFORMERS AND EVERYONE IN BETWEEN THAT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A FOUNDATIONAL STARTING PLACE THAT STARTS WITH WITH GOOD DATA -- SO IT I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH DATA IF IF WE DID -- THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE WITH WITH APPS -- AB. THE PROJECT THE PAPER PERSONS LISTA FORCE MEANT -- NOTE GAPS THAT WE HAVE FOR A AS WE IMPLEMENT SB TEN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THAT AS COMPLETE COMPREHENSIVE DATA. AS AS WE CAN -- AND THE LIST GOES ON SO -- I JUST RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE AND I THINK THE REPORTS AND AND THE AND THE INFORMATION AND EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT WE CAN REALLY BENEFIT HERE IN CALIFORNIA FROM MORE COMPREHENSIVE MORE COMPLETE DATA. THANK YOU -- BUT IT THE CHAIRS RECOMMENDING I'D MOVE THE BILL HAS MOVED TO SECOND IT LEADS TO THE VOTE. ON AB THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. GEN SIR HI LACKEY. BARRICADE HAN [inaudible] DEEP KAMLAGER-DOVE. I KAMLAGER-DOVE I QUIRK SANTIAGO [inaudible] WICKS. WICKS I BILLS ARE CALLED ME TO MARK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES THANK YOU STAFF AND IF YOU SEE THEM. TELL ME GET DOWN HERE. I GOT AROUND [inaudible] MR LOPEZ. AB THREE NINE ONE ITEM NUMBER. EIGHT CHAIR COLLEAGUES I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT TO YOU AB THREE NINETY ONE THAT ENABLES VEHICLE RENTAL COMPANIES TO REPORT THEFTS AS VEHICLES BECOME OVER DO. RATHER THAN BEING REQUIRED TO WAIT FIVE DAYS AFTER THE VEHICLE RETURN DATE. VEHICLE THEFT IS UNIQUE IN THE SENSE THAT ANY WASTED TIME AND REPORTING PROCESS ALLOWS THE CRIMINAL TO GEOGRAPHICALLY DISCONNECT FROM THE SCENE. MOTIVATION FOR AUTOMOBILE THEFT IS HIGHER WHEN THERE'S A FIVE DAY GRACE PERIOD GIVEN. LEAVING PLENTY OF TIME TO FLEE THE SCENEDISABLE THE GPS DISMEMBER THE VEHICLE FOR SALE WHEN FRAUD IS DISCOVERED IT IS IMPORTANT AT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOTIFIED IMMEDIATELY RATHER THAN WAITING UNTIL THE FIVE DAYS EXPIRE. AT THE EXPIRATION OF THE RENTAL CAR LEASE. UNDER THIS BILL THE FIVE DAY WAITING PERIOD WILL BE MINIMIZED THE FORTY EIGHT HOURS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT PROPER PROCEDURES ARE CONDUCTED. TO ENSURE BOTH SAFETY AND UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE RENTAL CAR AGENCY AND THE RENTER OF THE VEHICLE. I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND WITH THIS SAID COLLEAGUES I ASK YOU TODAY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THAT SIMPLY EXPEDITES IMPROVES THE SYSTEM OF TRACKING DOWN STOLEN CARS. THANK YOU ARCTIC ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES OPPOSITION. MARGOT GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS AND THE AUTHOR STAFF FOR THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAD ABOUT THE BILL -- THE REASON WE'RE OPPOSING THIS IS BECAUSE THAT IT WILL LEAD TO MORE REST OF INNOCENT PEOPLE -- MINOR DELAYS AND RETURNING RENTAL CARS OR IN A FAIRLY COMMON OCCURRENCE AND HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN DEALT WITH BY ADDITIONAL RENTAL CHARGES. AND LATE FEES AND AB THREE NINETY ONE WOULD TURN THESE DELAYS AND TO A CRIMINAL LAW EVENT -- IN IT WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE THE RISK BAD HONEST CONSUMERS WILL BE SUBJECT TO DANGEROUS INTERACTIONS WITH THE POLICE OFFICERS. WHO WOULD THEN BE BASICALLY REQUIRED TO ACT AS REP REPO MEN FOR THE CAR RENTAL INDUSTRY -- THIS IS NOT A SORT OF SPECULATIVE RISK THERE HAS BEEN A VERY -- THERE WAS AN ARTICLE LAST YEAR ABOUT HERTZ I AND THEIR RENTAL CAR. COMPUTER SYSTEM MALFUNCTIONING WHICH LED TO THE ARREST OF AT LEAST SIX PEOPLE. IN -- WISCONSIN PENNSYLVANIA KENTUCKY TEXAS IN INDIANA EVEN THOUGH ALL OF THOSE CUSTOMERS WERE CURRENT ON THEIR PAYMENTS. IN ONE OCCASION A WOMAN WHO WAS DRIVING HER RENTED CHEVY YUKON WHEN SHE WAS STOPPED IN ORDERED OUT OF THE CAR IN PENNSYLVANIA AT GUNPOINT. BY TROOPERS. THE CAR RENTAL CAR COMPANY HURTS HAD REPORTED THE CAR STOLEN. WHEN THE TROOPERS CALLED THE ONE EIGHT HUNDRED HERTZ NUMBER THE COMPANY ADMITTED ITS MISTAKE? BUT BECAUSE OF THE STATE POLICE POLICY. ARE THEY HAD TO IMPOUND THE VEHICLE AND THEY LEFT HER IN HER PASSENGERS STRANDED. AT A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT -- THIS WAS NOT THE END OF HER ORDEAL. A MONTH LATER SHE WAS PULLED OVER IN A DIFFERENT CAR. IN NEW JERSEY -- AN ORDERED OUT OF HER CAR AND ARRESTED FOR GRAND THEFT AUTO OF THE SAME HURTS CHEVY YUKON THEY HAD NOT TAKEN IT OUT OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEM. SHE WAS HELD IN JAIL FOR TWELVE DAYS WHERE SHE WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AND BEATEN. UP FINALLY THE JUDGE THROUGH THE CHARGES AGAINST HER OUT AND A CIVIL JURY RETURNED A VERDICT AGAINST HURT. AND AWARDED THE WOMAN DAMAGES SHE CLAIMS SHE REMAINS TRAUMATIZED FROM EXPERIENCE ACCORDING TO THE NEWS ARTICLE FROM A BLUE IS ABC -- THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER INCIDENTS THAT WERE DETAILED WITH PEOPLE ACTUALLY BEING ARRESTED. AND EVEN WITHOUT COMPUTER GLITCHES -- A CONSUMER A RENTAL CAR CUSTOMER WHO MIGHT REACH PLAN TO RETURN THE CAR ON FRIDAY BUT WAS UNABLE TO DO SO BECAUSE OF ILLNESS OR SOME OTHER EMERGENCY. WOULD IMMEDIATELY FACE ARRESTS CRIMINAL CHARGES AND PROSECUTIONS SINCE SIMPLY WHEN THEY RETURN THE CAR ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON. WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE BECAUSE AB THREE NINETY ONE WOULD CRIMINALIZE INNOCENT CONDUCT. THREATENS THE SAFETY OF CALIFORNIAN CONSUMERS. AND FORCES LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ACT AS ENFORCERS FOR THE RENTAL CAR INDUSTRY THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS FROM. COMMITMENT. SYDNEY HI. GOV THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST HAVE A QUESTION -- THE YOU KNOW MANY OF US PROBABLY TAKE -- RENTAL CARS OR RENT RENTAL CARS WITH WHEN WE'RE ON VACATION FAMILY VACATIONS ETCETERA SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. IF I AM RENTING A CAR AND I'M DRIVING. TO JAZZ STAR WHEREVER TO VACATION WITH MY FAMILY AND LIKE ALL THINGS DISCUSSIONS HAPPENING YOU END UP EXTENDING YOUR STAY. AND YOU DON'T NECESSARILY CALL THE RENTAL COMPANY BECAUSE YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE HOTEL THE FOOD THAT KIDS THE LAUNDRY EXCITER ACCENT OR A BUT YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE YOUR CREDIT CARD ON FILE AND OF COURSE YOU ARE INTENDING TO BRING IT BACK -- IF. THIS BILL WERE A LOT AND I DID NOT RETURN THE CAR WHEN I SAID I WOULD BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO EXTEND MY VACATION -- WHAT I THEN SORT OF POTENTIALLY BE CRIMINALIZED. IN ANSWER IN TO THAT. MOST OF YOUR RENTAL AGENCIES ON WILL NOT. USE THIS [inaudible] UNLESS THEY COMPLETELY BELIEVE THAT THIS CAR'S BEEN STOLEN. BECAUSE IT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS FOR THEM. TO USE THIS HEAVY HANDEDLY BECAUSE YOU WOULD BASICALLY ALIENATE YOUR CUSTOMER BASE SO THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL. IS FOR THOSE CARS THAT ARE STOLEN [inaudible] AND IF YOU ARE A CUSTOMER OF A RENTAL CAR AGENCY USUALLY YOU'RE A REPEAT CUSTOMER UNLESS YOU'RE A NEW. ONE MANY TIMES NEW CUSTOMERS. WOULD BE MOTIVATED TO STEAL A CAR OR IT COULD BE STOLEN OUT OF YOUR HOTEL. PARKING SPOT IN WHICH CASE YOU WOULD REPORTED. ON IN TODAY'S WORLD OF INSTANT COMMUNICATION THE RENTAL CAR COMPANIES GOING TO TEXT YOU CALL YOU. AND BASICALLY KNOW WHERE YOU'RE AT WHAT YOU'RE DOING SO IF YOU DID FORGET. TRUST ME THEY'LL BE REMINDING YOU BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO USE THIS -- IN A HEAVY HANDED WAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WILL. YOU MAY CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A YES VOTE. OKAY INSIDE I'M RECOMMENDING A AYE BECAUSE I'VE. A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH A CAR RENTAL GROUP WHOSE NAME I WON'T MENTION ENTERPRISE WILL NEVER USE AGAIN [inaudible] I WENT. TO MY DAUGHTER'S GRADUATION VIRGINIA. THEN DROVE TO NEW YORK TO RETURN THE CAR ON BUSINESS. SOMEHOW THEY COULDN'T FIND A CAR IN NEW YORK THREE MONTHS LATER. AFTER ENJOYING CHARGING ME. EVERY MONTH I HAD A TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL. INTO YOUR POINT. THEY WERE MORE INTERESTED IN CHARGE YOU MEAN EVERY DAY UNTIL I FOUND THAT CAR SINCE AND A LOT IN NEW YORK SOMEBODY HAD A MIX UP. BUT THE RENTAL CAR COMPANY DEBT I'M NOT GONNA MENTION ENTERPRISE KEPT CHARGING ME. EVERY DAY -- MISSING MIGHT BE MORE THEY WERE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT. RACKING UP MONEY ON MY CREDIT CARD THEN ANY BAND. THE CAR WAS STOLEN -- SO AND SO OF THE CHURCH RECOMMEND I VOTE. BUT CERTAINLY IT CAN WE HAVE A MOTION BUT I'M AB THREE NINETY ONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. GEN SIR HI LACKEY [inaudible] BAUER-KAHAN [inaudible] DEEP [inaudible] KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE NOT VOTING QUIRK SANTIAGO [inaudible] WICKS [inaudible] WICKS I MEASURE ON CALL WE NEED. SOME MORE MEMBERS HERE. ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AB THREE SIX TWO EGGMAN. EVERY YEAR IT GOOD AFTERNOON YES MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB THREE SIXTY TWO WHICH WILL BE A FAMILIAR ISSUE FOR MOST OF YOU AND I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY. ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- THIS BILL WILL ALLOW SAN FRANCISCO TO PILOT AN OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAM -- WHICH WILL BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE DEROGATORY NAMES SOME THAT YOU MAY HEAR FROM SOME OF THE OPPONENTS. PROGRAMS PILOTED UNDER THIS BILL WILL ALLOW ADULTS TO CONSUME CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES IN THE CLINICAL SETTING AND UNDER THE DIRECT SUPERVISION OF STAFF TRYING TO PREVENT AND TREAT DRUG OVERDOSE. PROVIDE MATERIAL TO PREVENT THE TRANSMISSION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES INCLUDING HIV AND HEPATITIS C.. N. TO RIDE ACCESS TO DRUG TREATMENT HOUSING MEDICAL CARE AND OTHER SERVICES -- THIS BILL HAS A SIX YEAR SUNSET AND REQUIRES ANNUAL REPORTING TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON IMPACTS OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE PROGRAM. NUMBER PEOPLE REFER TO DRUG TREATMENT AND OTHER MEASURES -- BUT I'M ASKING YOU TODAY IS TO VOTE FOR POLICY THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN OVER DECADES TO SAVE LIVES ELIMINATE THE RISK OF OVERDOSE REDUCE THE SPREAD OF HIV AND HEPATITIS C.. A POLICY THAT RESEARCH AND EVIDENCE SHOWS GETS PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT GET SOME CONNECTED WITH HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES AND GET SOME OFF DRUGS ENTIRELY. PROGRAMS LIKE THIS HELP. WE WE ALL OF US HAVE AN ISSUE WHEN WE WALK AROUND WE SEE PEOPLE ON THE STREETS OPENLY USING WE SEE OVERDOSES HAPPENING WE GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOMS AND THEY'RE OVERLOADED -- PEOPLE ARE LOCKED UP IN JAIL THERE IS A BETTER MORE HUMANE WAY. THIS BILL IN NO WAY CONDONES DRUG ABUSE BUT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE REALITY OF WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND US WE NEED EVERY TOOL IN OUR TOOLBOX TO COMBAT THE DRUG ADDICTION CRISIS THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. THIS IS A HUMANE STEP TOWARDS. AND RESURGENT EVIDENCE BASE TOWARDS GIVING PEOPLE ONE MORE OPTION ON THE STREET EVERY LIFE DESERVES RESPECT AND DIGNITY AND WE THINK THIS BILL DOES THAT -- WITH ME HERE TODAY IS OUR TO OUR DOCTOR DAVID KAHN AND WE CUT EASTON ICE AN A AND R. THOMAS IS ALSO HERE FOR THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS THAT SHE CAN ANSWER. THANK YOU. LOW UP MY NAME IS DOCTOR DAVID KAHNEMAN ADDICTION PSYCHIATRIST I HAPPEN TO WORK FOR THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE. WHICH IS THE STATE CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE. SEE SAM FOR SHORT IS A CO SPONSOR THIS BILL AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORTED -- CCM REPRESENTS OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PHYSICIAN AND ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONAL MEMBERS -- DEDICATED TO BEING THE VOICE FOR TREATMENT. AB THREE SIXTY TWO WILL IMPROVE ACCESS TO CARE ONE OF THE DEMONSTRATED A FAX OF SAY CONSUMPTION SIGHTSEERS HARM REDUCTION FACILITIES THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE GET INTO TREATMENT AS A RESULT OF A HEALTHY INTERACTION WITH A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL. NOBODY IS EVER OVERDOSED IN A HARM REDUCTION SITES SUCH AS THIS. IMPORTANTLY WE ALSO SEE NO INCREASES IN CRIME OR DRUG DEALING AS A RESULT OF THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS AND BECAUSE THIS IS THE SAFETY COMMITTEE WHAT I WANTED TO SPEAK TO SAFETY SPECIFICALLY. WE SEE A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE AND CARELESSLY DISCARDED -- NEEDLES ON THE STREET SO THAT PEOPLE CANNOT BE THAT -- THE VICTIM OF AN ACCIDENTAL NEEDLE STICK. AND WHAT WE SEE IS THAT MORE PEOPLE STOP USING DRUGS IN AN OUTDOOR SETTING WHICH NOBODY WANTS EITHER THE DRUG USER THE PUBLIC THE POLICE. OR THE GOVERNMENT. LET ME BE CLEAR THAT THIS BILL IS VERY SPECIFIC IT IS SELECTED TO SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN FRANCISCO ONLY. AND THERE WILL BE OTHER WITNESSES SPEAKING TO THE WILL OF THE CITY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. SAVE CONSUMPTION SITES WILL REDUCE LITTER IT WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO TREATMENT AND BE A BENEFIT AND MOST IMPORTANTLY AS AN ADDICTION PSYCHIATRIST THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REACH THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THE SERVICE MOST. I WORRY MUCH MORE ABOUT THE PATIENT WHO IS NOT IN CARE THEN THE PERSON WHO IS IN CARE. THIS BILL PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST TO GET INTO CARE. THANK YOU FOR TAKING LISTEN TO ME. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS VICTOR EYES IN ON THE C. E. O. FOR HEALTH RIGHT -- THREE SIXTY WARY OF ONE OF THE LARGEST SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT ORGANIZATIONS IN CALIFORNIA SERVING LOW INCOME POPULATION. WERE BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO BUT WE HAVE PROGRAMS IN MANY OF YOUR DISTRICTS -- AND WE'RE A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL I'M ALSO ON THE BOARD OF CAN'T BE WHICH IS THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ADDICTION TREATMENT PROVIDERS. FINALLY I AM A PERSON -- IN LONG TERM RECOVERY I'M A FORMER INJECTION HER WHEN USER FORMALLY HOMELESS I DID PROBABLY A LITTLE TOO MUCH RESEARCH FOR MY JOB. BUT AT THAT AT ANY RATE I WANT TO DRESS IN SPECIFIC -- THREE MINUTES THAT ARE THAT ARE COMMON ABOUT THIS BILL AND SOME OF WHICH WERE IN GOVERNOR BROWN TO VETO MESSAGE FOR THE LAST ITERATION OF THIS BILL. AND THE FIRST IS THAT PROGRAM SUCH AS THIS ENABLE DRUG USE -- AND I THINK IN HIS. IN THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE HE SAID THESE WERE ALL CHARACTERISTIC -- AS I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT ADDICTION AND PEOPLE IN WHO THIS BILL IS TARGETING SERVICES -- FOR THE PEOPLE THERE IS A BELIEF THAT IF WE MAKE PEOPLE REALLY REALLY MISERABLE OR WE LOCK THEM UP THAT'S GOING TO GET THEM INTO TREATMENT THAT SOME MYTH AROUND HITTING BOTTOM. IS WHAT DRIVES PEOPLE TO TREATMENT THEY WILL TELL YOU FROM LITERALLY DECADES OF EXPERIENCE -- THAT THAT -- DESPAIR AND MISERY DOES NOT DRIVE PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT. ALL IT EVER HAS DONE USING COERCION IS EXPLODER CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BILL OF OUR PRISONS PARTICULARLY. WHICH IS HAD DEVASTATING IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN PARTICULAR. IT'S REALLY HOPE. AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS ENGAGEMENT THAT MOVE PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT AND SO SITES SUCH AS THE OVERDOSE PREVENTION SITES SUCH AS THIS ALLOWS US TO ENGAGE PEOPLE TO REALLY EARLY LEVEL AND THEN BE ABLE TO MOVE THEM ALONG. INTO A CONTINUUM OF CARE. THE SECOND MYTH IS THAT SITES SUCH AS THIS ATTRACT A CRIMINAL ELEMENT. OR A CREATE KIND OF CRIME OR MIGHT LEAD TO DO YOU A D. WEISS. AND SO I WILL TELL YOU FOR ONE THING THERE ARE PEOPLE PUBLICLY USING DRUGS IN AN UNSUPERVISED WAY IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND AND SO THERE ARE ALWAYS CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE -- MADE MAYBE MAY OPERATE VEHICLES WITH OR WITHOUT THE SITES WITH THESE SITES OFFER THESE OVERDOSE PREVENTION SITES. IS THE ABILITY TO OBSERVE PEOPLE PRIOR TO THEM LEAVING AND GOING BACK OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY WHICH PUBLIC DRUG USE DOES NOT ALLOW -- FOR THE TREATMENT PROGRAMS THAT WE OPERATE TYPICALLY HAVE VERY VULNERABLE PEOPLE WHO COME TO THEM WERE VERY. AMBIVALENT ABOUT BEING IN TREATMENT. SOMETIMES THEY WANT TO BE THERE AND SOMETIMES THEY DON'T. SO YOU WOULD THINK WE WOULD ATTRACT A WHOLE LOT OF DRUG DEALERS WILL BE LIKE A RIGHT PLACE TO RECRUIT DRUG USE. BUT IN FACT IN EVERY INSTANCE WE IMPROVE THE COMMUNITIES WHERE WE OPERATE -- BOTH DIFFICULT THE JUDGE GENERAL QUALITY OF LIFE I THINK THAT IS NOT EVER BEEN PROVEN TO BE TRUE AND FINALLY. OF THIS IS PRESENTED THE OPPONENTS TO THIS BILL PRESENTED IS A FALSE CHOICE WE SHOULD SUPPORT TREATMENT. AND NOT THIS AS A SUPPORTING THIS IS ANTI TREATMENT BUT THOSE OF US WHO WORK IN THE TREATMENT FIELD. UNANIMOUSLY SEE THIS AS A EARLY ENGAGEMENT AND PART OF TREATMENT WE DO NOT SEE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS SEPARATE FROM -- AND SO I ASK THAT WE CONSIDER -- TAKING A BOLD MOVE IN THE FACE OF A OF A NATIONAL CRISIS AND SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU [inaudible] ANY [inaudible] YOUR I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IF THERE ARE ANY BUT OTHERWISE LARA THOMAS OF THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE WE'RE PROUD TO BE A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU.

THE DEFICIENCIES IN THIS VERY WELL INTENDED BILL. MISSING FROM THIS BILL. IS A COG NICE DOUBLE TREATMENT STRATEGY [inaudible] AND TO IT. TO ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT. AN ABSENCE OF A TREATMENT STRATEGY WILL SOMEHOW BE OKAY IS IT IS A TRAGIC MISTAKE -- I HAVE PERMISSION TO SAY THIS -- MY WIFE IS RECOVERING ADDICT AN ALCOHOLIC ON APRIL FOURTH SHE CELEBRATED FOR THIRTY FOUR YEARS GRADUALLY SOBRIETY -- WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BILL A LOT -- AND A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT SHE IS SAID FIRST OF ALL SHE DID SOME RESEARCH ON INSIGHT IN CANADA -- SINCE INSIDE HAS BEEN IN PLACE. THE NUMBER OF OVERDOSE DAY -- OVERDOSE. DOES DEATHS IN VANCOUVER HAVE ACTUALLY GONE UP. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT. ALEX DON'T EXCLUSIVELY USE INSIDE THERE ALSO SHOOTING UP -- IN THE ADJACENT AREA IF YOU LOOK AT THE ADJACENT AREA IT HAS BECOME A MAGNET. FOR SOCIAL DYSFUNCTION -- AND YES DEALERS DO SHOW UP IN THAT AREA BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEIR CUSTOMER BASE IS. MISSING FROM THIS BILL HE IS ANY DISCUSSION OF METHADONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY. MISSING FROM THIS BILL IS ANY REAL TRACK TO GET PEOPLE TO TREATMENT THIS. BY NINE WELL THERE'S TREATMENT AVAILABLE SOMEWHERE HAVE A NICE DAY. IT IS AS MY WIFE SAID. TO SUGGEST TO THAT. THIS WILL GET PEOPLE TO TREATMENT. WOULD BE LIKE SUGGESTING THAT WE BEGIN AN A A MEETING WITH THE HAPPY HOUR -- IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO WORK -- METHADONE TREATMENT AS AN ALTERNATIVE THERE ISN'T EVEN ANYTHING IN THIS BILL. THAT PROVIDES FOR MAKING SURE WHEN SOMEONE HAS SHOT UP. THAT THEY AS THEY LEAVE ART SO IMPAIRED THAT THEY'LL HURT THEMSELVES OR HEARD OTHERS. THIS BILL WILL ENABLE -- AND WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE LOOK SERIOUSLY ALL OF US IN A PROBLEM SOLVING WAY. AMENDING THIS BILL TO REFLECT THE FONTS IN GOVERNOR BROWN'S VERY THOUGHTFUL. OF VETO OF THIS -- WE OPPOSE THIS BILL AND WE HOPE THAT. AS IT. CONTINUES TO PROCEED THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT THAT DISCUSSION BEGINS TO TAKE PLACE BECAUSE IT'S ABSENT FROM THE BILL RIGHT NOW.

SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME MRS IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT A BETTER WAY TO GET TO THE SUCCESS SO AM I MISS UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS CORRECT IS. CURRENTLY WHAT WE'RE I MEAN WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THERE ARE MAJOR GAPS AND THINGS AREN'T WORKING -- THIS IS A HAS A SECURE SUNSET ON IT IT REQUIRES AN ANNUAL REPORT BACK TO SAY HOW IT'S WORKING SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO ASSESSMENTS AND ADJUSTMENTS AS NEEDED. AND IF THE COURT YEAH -- I BELIEVE A NUMBER OF THE THANKS REYES BY THE OPPOSITION. WELL FIRST OF ALL I'M VOTING FOR THE BELL A NUMBER OF THINGS REYES BY THE OPPOSITION OR GENUINE CONCERNS BUT FOR EXAMPLE. I REALLY THINK THAT THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO WILL IN FACT CHECK THAT AS PEOPLE LEAVE THAT THEY'RE ABLE. TO NOT BE A PROBLEM FOR THEMSELVES OR OTHERS SO I'M VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT AND I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BELL. MET MET MR QUIRK THE ONE COMMENT ABOUT NUMBER COMMENT I'M SORRY. THANK YOU -- ANYMORE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH COMMITTEE AND AND I APPLAUD MR LEVELS WIFE'S LONG TERM SOBRIETY BUT WHAT WE CALL THAT IS ANECDOTAL INFORMATION AND ANECDOTAL RESEARCH THAT SHE HAS CONDUCTED WHICH IS WHICH IS WHICH IS GOOD. BUT WE'VE HAD PROFESSIONAL SITTING HERE WITH A LIFETIME OF LOOKING AT THIS FROM A MULTITUDE OF ANGLES AND THEY HAD STRONG RESEARCH TO BACK IT UP -- SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AGAIN WE SEE THIS AS HARM REDUCTION WE SEE THIS AS THE FIRST CONTINUUM OF CARE -- AND THIS IS THE WAY IT. WORKS IN RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I WORK THANK YOU AND A NEW NO LIFE. A PROBABLY GUILTY OF LABELING THIS PROGRAM IN A SARCASTIC MANNER RIGHT I WON'T REPEAT ANY OF ANY OF THAT -- BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HI AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN. YOU HAVE TO GET OUT FRONT. THE REHABILITATION PART OF THIS AND THAT ONCE YOU WALK ME THROUGH. THAT THEY JUST DON'T WALK IN THE DOOR AND DO ACTS. THEIR SOCIAL WORKERS. DRUG REHABILITATION TO DATE THERE'S A THERE'S A WHOLE MYRIAD OF PEOPLE THAT I DON'T SAY POUNCE ON HIM BUT THEY CAN THEY CAN ACCESS WHEN THEY WALK IN IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT. HAVING. ACCESS. TO A CLEAN EXPERIENCE DEALING WITH A SO THEY DON'T DIE. THAT'S PART OF IT BUT I I GET THE FEELING IS A SMALL PART OF IT AND WHAT YOU'RE REALLY DOING IS. HOPEFULLY DOING SOMETHING -- LOOKING AT SOME OF THE INCORPORATING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ON THE OPPONENTS ARE TALKING ABOUT WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE. ONE ONE SIZE FITS ALL SO -- THE CHURCH RECOMMENDING AYE VOTE. LETTING YOU MAKING SURE THAT. WHEN YOU AS YOU GO FOR IT YOU TALK ABOUT ALL THE REHABILITATIVE THINGS THAT YOU YOU DO OFFER INSIDE? ON AB THREE SIXTY TO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED JONES SAWYER GEN SIR I LACKEY. LACKEY NO BARRICADE HAND. DEEP. KAMLAGER-DOVE HI KAMLAGER-DOVE I QUIRK. QUIRK I SANTIAGO. WICKS HI WICKS I MEASURES ON CALL NEEDS ONE MORE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] AND I BELIEVE MISTER BURROUGHS IN THE HOUSE. AB. SIX TWENTY FIVE ITEM NUMBER. FOURTEEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. AB SIX ONE FIVE WOULD INCREASE PENALTIES FOR PATIENT BROKERING IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN OVER NINETEEN HUNDRED CALIFORNIANS DI DID OPIOIDS. DRUG OPIATE OVERDOSE IS ARE CURRENTLY IN A TOP ALL TOP TWENTY CAUSES OF DEATH STATEWIDE. TAKE PATIENT BROKERS AS SEEN THIS EPIDEMIC AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A VULNERABLE POPULATION. IN MY HOME COUNTY OF ORANGE WE SEE A DALY TOLD THIS TAKES ON THE COMMUNITIES AND LIVES AFFECTED BY THE CRISIS. HAITIAN BROKER OCCURS WHEN A REHAB CENTER PAYS PATIENTS TO STAY AT THEIR FACILITIES OR PAY A THIRD PARTY FOR BRINGING PATIENTS TO THEIR STAB WHICH MEANT. WHILE THE STATE OUTLAWED THIS PRACTICE AND REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF VIOLATIONS ASSESSED PENALTIES AND SUSPEND OR REVOKE A LICENSE. DH CS IS ALREADY STATED THEY WILL FINALLY UP TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THIS VIOLATION. PATIENT BROKERS CAN MAKE ANYWHERE FROM FIVE TO TEN THOUSAND PER PATIENT WHICH MAKES THIS FIND LESS OF A WORRY FOR SOMEONE WHO STILL MAKE A LARGE PROFIT. THESE WOEFULLY INADEQUATE POLICIES WILL NOT DETER PATIENT BROKERING IN OUR STATE ESPECIALLY WHEN OTHER STATES LIKE FLORIDA DEAL SIMILAR -- HARSHER PENALTIES WITH THE BASE PUNISHMENT OF FELONY OF THE THIRD DEGREE AND A FINE OF UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. CALIFORNIA HAS MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND LICENSED FACILITIES IN AND WE HAVE MANY MANY MORE ON LICENSE. 50% OF THESE FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN MY HOME COUNTY OF ORANGE THERE'S AN ASCENDED TO FILL THESE HOMES OF PEOPLE AND HE'S PATIENT BROKERS AS A MIDDLE MAN IF WE CONTINUE TO HAVE IN SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES. THESE BROKERS EVEN FROM OUT OF STATE WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR PEOPLE THIS IS A LUCRATIVE BUSINESS THAT WILL CONTINUE TO HIRE PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION. IT'S TIME WE PUT AN END TO THIS PREDATORY PRACTICE TO PROTECT THE WELL BEING OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SEEKING RECOVERY. WITH ME TODAY IS NICOLE WATERMAN WHO REPRESENTS THE COUNTY OF ORANGE. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS NICOLE ORNAMENT ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT OF AB. SIX FIFTEEN ORANGE COUNTY IS HOME TO ONE HUNDRED FORTY LICENSED OUTPATIENT DRUG AND ALCOHOL ADDICTION TREATMENT AND RECOVERY CENTERS AND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE HALFWAY HOUSES. BECAUSE THE COUNTY HAS BECOME A BIT OF A DESTINATION FOR DRUG AND ALCOHOL RECOVERY PROGRAMS WE ARE ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE ABUSES OF PATIENT BROKERS EXPLOITING VULNERABLE PATIENTS. AS A RESULT OF OPPORTUNISTS ABUSING THE SYSTEM THE ORANGE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE MAINTAINS A SOBER LIVING HOME INVESTIGATION PROSECUTION TEAM. TO INVESTIGATE REPORTS OF CRIMINAL AND CIVIL VIOLATIONS RELATED TO SOBER LIVING HOMES AND ADDICTION AND TREATMENT OR RECOVERY CENTERS. LAST FALL INVESTIGATIONS BY THIS TASK FORCE LED TO THE ARRESTS OF TWO GROUPS OF FREE HAVE OPERATORS PHYSICIANS AND STAFF FROM DRUG TESTING CENTERS. PATIENT BROKERING IS AIMED AT PROFITING OFF OF ADDICTION BY PRIORITIZING PROVIDER REVENUES OVER PATIENTS MEDICAL NEEDS. IN MANY CASES THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS ARE IGNORED OR IMPROPERLY ADDRESSED LEADING TO A REVOLVING DOOR FACILITIES FOR THE PATIENTS AND INCREASED INCOME FOR OPERATORS. ALL THE RECOVERY SERVICES ARE IN HIGH DEMAND THE OVERALL RATE OF OVERDOSES IN THE COUNTY HAS INCREASED BY 80% OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. ORANGE COUNTY IS COMMITTED TO COMBATING THE DANGEROUS SCRUPULOUS PRACTICE OF PATIENT BROKERING AND AB SIX FIFTEEN WILL IMPLEMENT APPROPRIATE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE SERIOUS CRIME. WE THEREFORE URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THE MEASURE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. DISABILITY OR CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- KATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. JUST LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA ENACTED A LAW PROHIBITING OUT THE ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE TREATMENT CENTERS COUNSELORS AND LICENSED PROFESSIONALS FROM GIVING OR RECEIVING ANY REMUNERATION FOR REFERRALS. THAT LOG JUST WENT INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS AGO. IT ALLOWS DH CS TO ASSESS PENALTIES TO SUSPEND OR REVOKE THE LICENSE OF A TREATMENT FACILITY OR TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE LICENSE OR CERTIFICATION OF A TREATMENT PROFESSIONAL ON THE BASIS OF OF A VIOLATION OF THIS LAW. YET WITHOUT GIVING THE DH CS THE CHANCE TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW LAW AND ASSESS ITS EFFECTIVENESS EIGHTY SIX FIFTEEN WOULD JUMP IMMEDIATELY TO THE IMPOSITION OF FELONY PENALTIES FOR THIS CONDUCT -- THERE IS NO RASON TO CREATE A NEW CRIME MUST MUCH LESS A FELONY WHEN SEVERAL CIVIL PENALTIES FOR THE CONDUCT HAVE JUST GONE INTO A FACT. THE NEW LAW SHOULD BE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO WORK BEFORE CHANGES ARE PROPOSED WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. CNN YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- WE'RE JUST TRYING. TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE TEETH INTO THE BILL THAT WE SUPPORT LAST YEAR BECAUSE IF YOU'RE AN OPERATOR AND YOU'RE MAKING BETWEEN -- THIRTY AND SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SOBER LIVING HOME. FACING A TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS CIVIL FINE. AND WALKING AWAY WITH TWENTY EIGHT OR FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS ISN'T ISN'T MUCH OF A DETERRENT TO CONTINUE THESE PRACTICES SO WE OUR GOAL IS JUST BELOW MORE TEETH IN THE BILL SO WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU OF AN EYE I WOULD LIKE FOR TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE TIME TO MARINATE SO WE CAN SEE WHETHER OR NOT. AS YOU WERE SAYING THE TWO THOUSAND IT'S NOT ENOUGH -- IN FACT IF THAT WAS A A MAJOR CONCERN WE PROBABLY SHOULD OF IN THE LARA BILL THAT EARLY WAS DONE THAT KIND OF SET ALL OF THIS -- WE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE HAD IT. OR REYES STATED THE AMOUNT OR DID SOME OF THAT STUFF THEN. BUT TO MAKE IT A FELONY BEFORE WE'VE WHAT REALLY DONE THIS ABOUT A FEW MONTHS AND UNTIL WE CAN GET SOME MAYBE CREDIBLE INFORMATION WE MIGHT BE AT WHERE YOU'RE AT BUT I WANT. TO GET MORE. MORE STUDY MORE INFORMATION LET THAT MONDAY BILL RUN ITS COURSE A LITTLE BIT BEFORE -- WE START MAKING MAJOR CHANGES TO IT. WITH THE AT THE CHURCH RECOMMEND A NO VOTE [inaudible] THE BILL. SO I DON'T GET MISTER DEEP IN TROUBLE. I'LL GIVE IT A SECOND. HE'S IN TROUBLE DAY. I'LL GIVE YOU A SECOND BUT I AM VOTING NOBODY GETS SICK IT APPRECIATE CARS. STORY MORE CONTROVERSY OVER THERE.

DID YOU PRESENT YOUR EX OKAY. YOU YOU. MISTER REPP LACKEYS READY SO. ONE SIX NINE SIX ITEM NUMBER SIXTEEN RIGHT WELL THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT AB SIX NINETY SIX OF THE BILL. THANK YOU WHAT TO PROVIDE AN OBJECTIVE APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING THE APPLICATION OF OC SPRAY JUVENILE INSTITUTIONAL FACILITIES I'M NOT GOING TO GO ON AND I'M GOING TO LET MY WITNESS -- DANIELLE SUCH AS ON BEHALF OF OUR SPONSOR THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE. CERTAINLY. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ WITH THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA A PLEASED TO BE A SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE I WILL KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF BUT TO JUST WANT TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS -- OUR OUR FIRST AND FOREMOST GOAL IS ALWAYS -- TO WORK IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE MINERS THAT WE SERVE IN AND DO WHAT IS BEST. FOR THE YOUTH AND THE STAFF KIND OF AN ARC OUR CARE AND CUSTODY AND THIS REALLY IS AN EFFORT BORN OUT OF THAT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT AS A PROFESSION THAT WE ARE TAKING A LOOK AT POLICIES AS IT PERTAINS TO YOUTH IN OUR COUNTY JUVENILE FACILITIES FROM. THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT -- RESEARCH AND DATA GUIDES TO BE THE BEST PRACTICES -- AND LOOK AT ALL OF THE FACTORS INVOLVED IN THE USE OF OC SPRAY RIGHT NOW OC SPRAY -- IS USED AS A MATTER OF POLICY AND PRACTICE AND IT'S A LOCAL DETERMINATION BUT THERE ARE EXTENSIVE -- TITLE FIFTEEN REGULATIONS THAT GOVERN ITS USE TRAINING -- DECONTAMINATION AND A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS -- IN LIGHT OF ALL OF THAT AGAIN AS A PROFESSION WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AND RECOGNIZING THAT BOTH OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS HAD AN INTEREST IN LOOKING AT THE USE OF CHEMICAL. SPRAYS IN JUVENILE FACILITIES THAT WE WANT -- TO TAKE AN INDEPENDENT UNBIASED LOOK AT THAT REALLY HAVE A THIRD PARTY ENTITY DELVE INTO THIS ISSUE TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE FACTORS INVOLVED IN INCLUDING -- POTENTIAL THAT IT'S USED AS A HARM REDUCTION AGENT -- FOR PHYSICAL ALTERCATIONS AND WITH THAT AGAIN GUIDE THIS COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND POLICY DECISIONS GOING FORWARD SO WITH THAT WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY AND I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU FOR ANY OF THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. HONORABLE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS VIRGINIA CORRIGAN I'M A STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE USE LAWCENTER -- WE APPRECIATE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH STAFF AND IN MEN IN THE MEMBERS OFFICE AND WITH C. POCK ON THIS ISSUE BUT WE ARE PROPOSING TODAY -- THE USE OF CHEMICAL AGENTS IN CALIFORNIA JUVENILE FACILITIES OBVIOUSLY. YOUR CLOTHES SORRY ABOUT THAT. IS OBVIOUSLY AN ISSUE THAT DESERVES CAREFUL THOUGHTFUL AND BALANCED STUDY IT'S VITAL THAT CALIFORNIA'S POLICYMAKERS AND PUBLIC HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT HOW CHEMICAL AGENTS ARE CURRENTLY USED IN CALIFORNIA. AND ABOUT THE BEST PRACTICES THAT EXIST HERE AND NATIONALLY ON THE ISSUE BUT UNFORTUNATELY EIGHTY SIX NINETY SIX DOES NOT PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION THAT'S NECESSARY TO MAKE THOUGHTFUL POLICY DECISIONS -- AB SIX NINETY SIX CALLS FOR RESEARCH ON THE IMPACTS AND EFFICACY OF USING PEPPER SPRAY ON YOUNG PEOPLE. BUT THE RESEARCH ON THOSE ISSUES IS ALREADY CLEAR THE USE OF CHEMICAL AGENTS IS HARMFUL TO YOUNG PEOPLE BOTH PHYSICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND IT IMPEDES REHABILITATION BY HARMING THE TRUSTING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SEVEN YOUTH THAT IS CRITICAL TO CHANGING YOUNG PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR. MOREOVER AB SIX NINETY SIX WOULD NOT REQUIRE ANY AN ANALYSIS OF HOW CHEMICAL AGENTS ARE USED IN CALIFORNIA OR CONSIDERATION OF BEST PRACTICES IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY THAT MAY SELECT SERVE AS ALTERNATIVES TO THE USE OF PEPPER SPRAY. NOR WOULD AB SIX NINETY SIX REQUIRE THAT EITHER THE RESULTING STUDY OR ENTER ANY UNDERLYING DATA ON THE USE OF CHEMICAL AGENTS BE MADE PUBLIC. EIGHTY SIX NINETY SIX WOULD ALSO VAST THE BOARD OF STATE IN COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS RATHER THAN A NEUTRAL BODY WITH SOLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CHOOSING A RESEARCH ENTITY TO CONDUCT THE STUDY. IN ADDITION THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE STUDY TO BE CONDUCTED BY RESEARCH AGENCY WITH A FOCUS ON INSTITUTIONAL CARE FOR YOUTH BUT WAS WHICH IS ALSO NEUTRAL WITH REGARD TO THE USE OF CHEMICAL SPRING ON YOUTH. THE REALITY IS THAT RESEARCH AND AGENCIES WITH A FOCUS ON INSTITUTIONAL CARE FOR YOUTH ALREADY HAVE A POSITION ON CHEMICAL SPRAY USE THAT THE BEST PRACTICES TO BAN IT. ALTHOUGH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE USE OF CHEMICAL AGENTS IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS NECESSARY. THE STUDY EIGHTY SIX NINETY SIX WOULD CREATE WOULD NOT MEET THIS NEED. UNLIKE AB THIRTEEN TWENTY ONE A MEASURE THAT WAS RECENTLY PASSED BY THIS COMMITTEE. EIGHTY SIX NINETY SIX DOES NOT CREATE THE NATIONAL NECESSARY TRANSPARENCY OR PROVIDE POLICYMAKERS WITH THE INFORMATION THAT IS NEEDED. TO HAVE OBJECTIVE POLICY GUIDANCE TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS ISSUE. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO WAY OUT THANK YOU NEXT. MARCO GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION I WOULD ECHO ON THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT SB SIX NINE SIX IS UNNECESSARY. STUDIES ON THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF PEPPER SPRAY ON NEWMAN CERTAINLY CHEN. IN FACT THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS HAS A FACTSHEET ON THEIR WEBSITE LISTING SEVERAL OF THE STUDIES RIGHT NOW ONE OF THEM IS THE COUNCIL OF JUVENILE CORRECTION CORRECTIONAL ADMINISTRATORS MAY. TWENTY ELEVEN ISSUE BRIEF PEPPER SPRAY IN JUVENILE FACILITIES ANOTHER ONE IS THE CENTER FOR CHILDREN'S ONE POLICY MAY FOURTEENTH TWENTY TWELVE FACTSHEET. CHEMICAL AGENTS IN JUVENILE FACILITIES SO THAT THE STATE BOARD ALREADY HAS THESE STUDIES AND THEY'RE PUTTING THEY SEE FIT TO PUT THEM ON THEIR OWN WEBSITE -- THIRTY FIVE STATES NOW DETENTION HALLS -- AND I THINK THAT IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO JOIN THOSE STATES. AB SIX NINE SIX IS CALLING FOR A BELATED AND RE DONE TO TWO AND A HALF YOUR STUDY REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF PEPPER SPRAY SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON AB SIX NINE SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARENA WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. FOR ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN OPPOSITION WE SUPPORT MISTER% GIBSON'S BILL THIRTEEN TWENTY ONE FOR BETTER DATA COLLECTION THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE WERE SELECTED I'M GONNA HAVE MISSED SUCH AS ANSWER SOME OF THE ISSUES AND SHE'LL BE MY CLOTHES. APPRECIATE THAT I THINK -- AT A THROUGH THE CHAIR -- YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK FOR US WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S DISCUSSIONS LAST YEAR AND BOTH PREVIOUSLY IN THIS COMMITTEE ON ON BILLS RELATED TO THIS ISSUE AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. TO TO SEE PARK IN AND TO THE CHIEFS THAT WERE ENGAGING IN THIS CONVERSATION NOT HAVE ALREADY ANSWERED THE QUESTION OF WHAT TO DO THAT WE REALLY ARE OPEN TO SAYING LET'S LOOK AT ALL OF THE DYNAMICS INVOLVED IN THE USE OF A SEA SPRAY -- WE RECOGNIZE THAT CERTAINLY THERE HAVE BEEN -- SOME RESEARCH AND FOCUS ON THE USE OF OC SPRAY IN CERTAIN CONTEXTS -- AND AND HOW IT PERTAINS TO THE YOUTH BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THE FACTORS INVOLVED. THAT THIS COMMITTEE TALKED ABOUT LAST YEAR AS IT PERTAINS -- TO WHAT WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS -- OF NOT HAVING TO INTERVENE IN A PHYSICAL MANNER BETWEEN -- STAFFING YOUTH BY USING OC SPRAY -- AND NOT BEING A TACTIC TO DE ESCALATE AGAIN VERSUS HAVING TO KIND OF THE USE OF PHYSICAL INTERVENTION AND SO I THINK -- FOR US WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE ASKING THE QUESTION IN GETTING THE ANSWER THROUGH INDEPENDENT RESEARCH PART OF THE REASON THE REASON THIS WAS STRUCTURED AS IT KIND OF INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY ENTITY THAT HASN'T YET -- LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE OR MADE A POLICY DETERMINATION AS WE WANT TO AGAIN MAKE SURE IT IS A AN INDEPENDENT -- OF FOCUS ON THIS THAT IT ISN'T FROM EITHER RESEARCH ENTITY THAT HASN'T ALREADY -- OPINED ON ELIMINATION OR OR NOT AGAIN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS IS -- FRAMED AS AS A RESEARCH DRIVEN AND DATA DRIVEN AS POSSIBLE SEE POCKETS FULLY COMMITTED -- TO WORKING OBVIOUSLY WITH -- THE DATA ELEMENTS THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO CARRY OUT THIS STUDY -- AND AND THE REASON WE STRUCTURED IN THE WAY OF NOT DEFINING WHO THAT ENTITY WOULD BE IS THAT AGAIN WE ARE OPEN TO HEARING IN ONE WOULD WANT TO SEE FROM THE LEGISLATURE'S PERSPECTIVE AND FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT WHO THAT ENTITY SHOULD BE THAT IS -- YOU KNOW KIND OF BEST SITUATED -- TO MANAGE THESE -- SO ALL THAT TO SAY WE WE CERTAINLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND AND IT'S OUR FOCUS WITH THIS BILL TO DO WHAT IS IS BEST IN OUR JUVENILE FACILITIES AND AND ALWAYS LET OUR RESEARCH AND DATA GUIDE THOSE DECISION [inaudible] THANK YOU -- NOTED. AS SOMEONEWHO DIDN'T AN AUDIT REHABILITATION AND KNOWING THAT IT WAS DIFFERENT PEOPLE LOOK AT THAT ARE WITH DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES EVEN. QUESTIONING MY MARK WAS NOT I BELIEVE THE REAL BILL TATIAN -- I WISH I MAYBE CAN HAPPEN IN APPROPRIATIONS BY REALLY DO WISH. THAT WE COULD MAKE BOTH THE GIPSON THEN THE LACKEY OUGHT TO COME TOGETHER YOU CHOOSE AN INDEPENDENT. RESEARCHER OR WHATEVER -- TO DO THE AUDIT AUDITOR AND THEN. THE CHAIR APPROACH DID DECIDE HOW IT'S GOING TO GET PAID FOR IT ALL TO ME HE'S GOING TO GO INTO APPROACH AND SOMEBODY'S GOING TO BE HOPEFULLY BE APPROPRIATED FOR A STUDY ON THIS -- I WOULD RATHER HAVE BOTH SIDES WHO HAVE PROBABLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES LOOKING AT IT AND AS THE LAWYERS WILL TELL YOU SEE YOU YOU. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL SIDES OF THE ISSUE -- BEFORE YOU MAKE A FINAL DECISION AND SO -- I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND ASK EVERYONE TO GO AHEAD VOTE THIS OUT SO THAT. WE CAN GO OVER TO APPROACH AND HOPEFULLY. SHE CAN. FIGURE OUT. HOW TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE BEST DATA BACK NOT ONE THAT FAVORS ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER? BUT CAN GET TO THE ACTUAL TRUTH GOOD THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT BUT YOUR BIGGEST PROBLEM WILL BE JUST GETTING MONEY. GET THIS DONE. AB SIXTY SIX THE MOTION IS TO PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS JONES SAWYER HI JOHN SIR IRAQI. LACKEY I BAUER-KAHAN BAUER-KAHAN I DEEP. KAMLAGER-DOVE AND I FOR THE NEWLYWEDS. IN ORDER TO HAVE AYE QUIRK SANTIAGO. WICKS WICKS I THE MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU. I NUMBER THIRTY NINE AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO MR CHOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. HI. AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO WOULD HELP ADDRESS ONE OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF RECENT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS. SUCH AS PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN BY CODIFYING TO COURT CASES WHICH CLARIFIED THE MULTIPLE INCIDENTS OF THEFT. CAN BE AGGREGATED INTO A CHARGE OF GRAND THEFT IN ORDER TO PREVENT CRIMINALS FROM GETTING AWAY WITH THE COMMITTING MORE FREQUENT SMALLER CRIMES. IN THE CASE PEOPLE VERSUS BAILEY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT ESTABLISHED THAT REPEATED ACTS OF THEFT. CAN BE AGGREGATED AND PROSECUTED AS A FELONY IF IT IS FOUND OUT THE THEFTS WERE CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO ONE INTENTION ONE GENERAL IMPULSE AND ONE PLAN. ADDITIONALLY IN THE CASE PEOPLE VERSUS COLUMBIA RESEARCH CORPORATION. THE COURT FOUND THAT AN INDIVIDUAL CAN BE CHARGED WITH GRAND THEFT BASED ON A SERIES OF PETTY THEFTS. IF THEY WERE CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO A SINGLE PLAN AND INTENT AND ALSO INVOLVE MULTIPLE VICTIMS. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN RE CLASSIFY CERTAIN THEFT. AND DRUG POSSESSION OFFENSES TWO MISDEMEANORS SUCH AS PETTY THEFT WHICH IS DEFINED AS OBTAINING ANY PROPERTY BY SELF. OR THE VALUE OF THE MONEY LABOR REAL OR PERSONAL PROPERTY TAKEN DOES NOT EXCEED DONE NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PROP FORTY SEVEN NUMEROUS A COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS OVER ANY INCREASE IN PETTY THEFT CRIMES. COMMITTED BY INDIVIDUALS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM BY ATTEMPTING TO KEEP THEIR THOUSAND UNDER THE NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR THRESHOLD. FOR EXAMPLE PROPERTY CRIMES IN MY DISTRICT THE FORTY NINE TO SOME A DISTRICT OUT HAVE. A HAVE A REASON TWENTY ONE POINT PROP FORTY SEVEN WAS PASSED. THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONFUSION AS TO WHETHER MULTIPLE THOUSAND COULD BE AGGREGATED IN ORDER TO EQUAL OF GRAND THEFT. NOW BY CODIFYING THESE CASES AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO WILL MAKE IT CLEAR THAT MULTIPLE TO STING. BUT YET RELATED INCIDENTS OF THEFT WHETHER COMMITTED AGAINST ONE OR MORE VICTIMS CAN BE AGGREGATED TO A CHARGE OF GRAND THEFT. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMITTEE HAD HAS RAISED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER THIS BILL WILL IN FACT AMENDED PROP. FORTY SEVEN YESTERDAY I RECEIVED THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL OR OPINION THAT CONCLUDED THAT PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN DID NOT REPEAL BAILEY THAT IS THE CASE EXPRESSLY OR IMPLIEDLY. ACCORDINGLY BECAUSE BAILEY IS STILL IS COMMON LAW AND WAS NOT REPEALED A STATUE THAT CODIFIES BAILEY IS NOT AN AMENDMENT TO PROP. FORTY SEVEN ADDITIONALLY COMMITTEE HAS RAISED CONCERNS AND STATED THAT IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL IS DECLARATORY OF THE EXISTING LAW BECAUSE THERE ARE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CASES THAT PROVIDE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON THE STATE OF THE CASE LAW. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT NONE OF THE CASES CITED OVERRULE BAILEY. OR COLUMBIA. THESE TWO CASES ARE STILL VALID CASE LAW AS SUCH I BELIEVE IT IS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE TO CODIFY THESE CASES VIA AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO AND PROVIDE CLARITY TO THE STATUE. IN FACT. IN THE RECENT CASE TWENTY FOURTEEN CASE WHAT MAR THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT ALSO STATED IN ITS CONCURRENT OPINION. QUOTE IF THE DEFENDANT HAS ENGAGE IN MULTIPLE RELATED TAKINGS A PROSECUTOR IS NOT PROHIBITED FROM CHARGING THE DEFENDANT BOTH WITH ONE COUNT OF A LARGER AGGREGATED SOUTH. END WITH SEVERAL AMOUNTS OF SMALL INDIVIDUAL PHELPS. A PROSECUTOR MAY CHARGE A DEFENDANT UNDER BOTH THEORIES SINCE IT MAY NOT BE EVIDENT AT THE TIME OF CHARGING WHETHER THE TAKINGS WORK IN FACT COMMITTED PURSUANT TO ONE INTENTION ONE GENERAL IN PAUL'S. AND ONE PLAN. FINALLY LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL IS HERE WITH US TODAY -- TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE A WAS -- WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IBM [inaudible] YES. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHASING GUNS ALL THIS REPRESENT THE CITY OF ROSEMEAD WE ALSO REPRESENT NUMBERS CITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THAT HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH THIS ISSUE THEY WERE SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR LEGISLATION MISTER CHAIR LEADERSHIP LAST YEAR ON A. B. TEN SIXTY FIVE ON THEFT RINGS -- WE SEE THIS AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A POOR DECISION VERSUS A PATTERN OF DECISIONS AND WE APPRECIATE THE ANALYSIS REFERENCING THE LA TIMES ARTICLE WHERE INDIVIDUALS WERE. BOASTING ABOUT THE ABILITY. TO COMMIT A SERIES OF CRIMES AS LONG AS THEY WERE UNDER THE THRESHOLD AND FOR THAT REASON WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST FOR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MR MEMBERS RYAN SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION LIKE TACKLE COMMENTS OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- MIGHTY COVERED PRETTY MUCH ALL THE POINTS -- INRIVERSIDE COUNTY PROPERTY CRIMES HAVE GONE UP SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND THAT WERE EXPERIENCING THE SAME THINGS THAT I THINK A LOT OF THE OTHER CITIES AND COUNTIES AROUND THE STATE ARE EXPERIENCING. THAT CRIMINALS MANY OF THEM NOT ALL OF THEM MANY OF THEM I FIGURED OUT THE NINE FIFTY LIMIT. AND ARE BEING VERY CAREFUL TO NOT EXCEED THAT -- AND BASED ON THEIR BELIEF THAT AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T OVER NINE FIFTY EVEN IF THEY GO BACK THERE EVERY SINGLE DAY. THAT DEAL IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE A FELONY AND THEY'LL JUST GIVE BASELESS SLAP ON THE WRIST SO FOR THOSE REASONS OTHER SIDE SURE CESSATION. SUPPORT THIS BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. OF ANY OTHER [inaudible] IN SUPPORT. OF THE BILL. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION YEAH MARGOT GEORGE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION -- WERE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW PROSECUTORS TO AGGREGATE SMALL A SEPARATE PETTY STEP SO THEY CAN CHARGE FELONY GRAND UP. THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE TWICE SPOKEN ON THE SUBJECT -- AND PROP FORTY SEVEN WHICH WAS PASSED ON NOVEMBER FOURTH OF TWENTY FOURTEEN AND PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE WHICH WAS PASSED ON NOVEMBER EIGHTH OF TWENTY SIXTEEN AB. SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO ACTUALLY PROPOSES TO AMEND PROP FORTY SEVEN IN A MANNER THAT IS NOT INTENDED BY THE VOTERS. AND EVEN IF THAT WERE SO INTENDED A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE LEGISLATURE IS REQUIRED -- WE BELIEVE THAT AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO TWICE TO AVOID THIS REQUIREMENT BY STATING THAT IS DECLARATORY. OF EXISTING LAW AND THE CASE THAT THEY WERE RELYING ON PEOPLE V. WITH MERCK -- BACK CASE INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH WAS DECIDED ON JULY TWENTY FOURTH OF TWENTY FOURTEEN SO IT WAS DECIDED IN JULY. AND THEN IN NOVEMBER THE VOTERS PASSED PROP. FORTY SEVEN SO THE CASE LAW PASSED BY THE COURT BEFORE -- THE PROP FORTY SEVEN WAS PASSED IN BEFORE PROP. SIXTY THREE IT'S NOT REALLY DETERMINED OF OF THIS ISSUE UNTIL THE COURT ADDRESSES SAID AGAIN. PROP FORTY SOMEONE MADE IT CLEAR THAT A THEFT OF LESS THAN NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS SHOULD BE TREATED AS PETTY THEFT AND SHALL BE PUNISHED AS A MISDEMEANOR -- PROP FORTY SEVEN PROVIDED. THAT IT WOULD WANTED IT WOULD BE BROADLY CONSTRUED TO ACCOMPLISH THAT PURPOSE AND THAT ONE OF THE PURPOSES WAS TO REQUIRE MISDEMEANORS. INSTEAD OF FELONIES FOR NON SERIOUS NON THE ONLY VIOLENT CRIMES LIKE PETTY THEFT AND DRUG POSSESSION. AND LESSEN THE CALL THE UP WAS -- UNLESS THE DEFENDANT HAD PRIOR CONVICTIONS WERE SPECIFIED VIOLENT OR SEX OFFENSES. PROP FORTY SEVEN STATED. ON ITS FACE THAT IT MAY BE AMENDED BY A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE MEMBERS OF EACH HOUSE OF THE LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. SO LONG AS THE AMENDMENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH AND FURTHER THE INTENT OF THE ACT. THE LEGISLATURE'S MIGHT MAY BY MAJORITY VOTE TO AMEND AB -- REPEAL PROVISIONS TO FURTHER REDUCE THE PENALTIES FOR ANY OF THE OFFENSES ADDRESSED BY THIS ACT. WE BELIEVE. THAT IF THIS IS A PROBLEM THIS IT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED IN A MANNER SUCH AS THE CHEERS BILL OF ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT. THAT THIS ATTEMPT TO JUST AGGRAVATE AGGREGATE NOT AGGRAVATE START -- AGGRAVATING BUT BUT AGGREGATE SMALL SEPARATE PETTY THEFTS THAT COULD BE AT THE STORE OVER HERE AT THAT STORE OVER THERE AND AND IS -- IS NOT. IN LINE WITH WHAT THE VOTERS INTENDED AND PROP FORTY SEVEN SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MIKE A DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA HERE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO AB -- SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO IN ADDITION TO THE BILL USURPING THE WELL AND THE INTENT OF THE VOTERS WHO OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVED PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN AS MY COLLEAGUE HAS STATED -- WE ALSO DON'T BELIEVE THIS BILL IS NECESSARY AND IN LIGHT OF EXISTING LAW CURRENT LAW ALREADY PROVIDES COURTS WITH SUFFICIENT POWER TO PUNISH MULTIPLE FACTS OF PROPERTY UNDER CURRENT LAW. AS ESTABLISHED BY PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN THE COURT MAY IMPOSE A SANCTION OF UP TO ONE YEAR IN COUNTY JAIL FOR ANY PETTY THEFT. A PERSON WHO COMMITS MULTIPLE PETTY THEFT DEFENDS SAYS IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME CAN ALREADY BE PUNISHED WITH SIGNIFICANT JAIL TIME. PETTY THEFT OFFENSES ARE OFTEN CRIMES OF POVERTY EVEN WHEN THEY'RE COMMITTED ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION BY THE SAME PERSON. DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN CALIFORNIA SHOWS THAT INCREASING AT THE PENAL CONSEQUENCES FOR PETTY OFFENSES TO INCLUDE A FELONY CONVICTION WILL NOT LEAD TO LESS RECIDIVISM IT WILL ONLY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO GET THEIR LIVES BACK ON TRACK AND WE'LL WASTE TAXPAYER DOLLARS. IT IS EXACTLY THIS PUNITIVE APPROACH TO LOW LEVEL NONVIOLENT OFFENSES THAT THE VOTERS REJECTED WHEN THEY APPROVED PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN AND SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER. IN OPPOSITION. JANUARY TEARS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE AN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] CAN. NONE. WHO COME? ONE ALL RIGHT AT IT ON A QUESTION BUT JUST COMMENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BUT THIS IS YOUR THANK YOU WAS CHAIRMAN -- I WASN'T US -- SEINING FOR THIS BUT BUT I I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING BECAUSE COMING FROM -- A LOCAL GOVERNMENT BACKGROUND. WHERE ARE DOING MY TIME ON THE CITY COUNCIL WE RECEIVE NUMEROUS CALL -- AFTER THE PASSAGE OF PROP FORTY SEVEN WHERE -- SHOP OWNERS WOULD KHÃ´NG COMPLAINT. AND THE POLICE BASICALLY JUST TOLD HANDS UP AND SAID YOU KNOW THAT IF IT IS A IT IS A PETTY THEFT AND AND IS UNDER NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS IS NOTHING WE CAN DO -- NOW TO SOME PEOPLE NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY. FOR A SMALL SHOP OWNER -- IT IS AND AND AND AND AND I I DISAGREE WITH THE PREMISE THAT THAT -- PETTY THEFT IS BASED ON POVERTY BECAUSE HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU DEFINE THAT. IS ONE THING. TO STEAL FOOD TO FEED YOUR YOUNG CHILDREN IS NOTHING TO GO TO WALMART OR LIKE A STORE AND RUN OUT WITH -- TWO BOTTLES OF JACK DANIEL'S. AS LONG AS UNDER HUNT NINE HUNDRED FIFTY BUCKS. I DON'T THINK THAT'S STEALING FOR POVERTY IS USED TO STEALING BECAUSE YOU YOU HAVE A SICKNESS. AND I'D SIT SO I THINK THAT IF WE CAN WE SHOULD AT LEAST GIVE. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT -- SOME MEANS OF PROTECTING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE WHO. WILL MAKE OR BREAK THEIR THEIR THEIR PAYROLL THAT MONTH SOMETIME BASED ON JUST NINE HUNDRED BUCKS AND AND AND YES I KNOW THAT THE CHAIR. HAD A TRY TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM THROUGH EIGHT AND ORGANIZED CRIME. BUT ORGANIZED CRIME COULD MEAN LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE ONE PERSON IF IF THAT IF THAT CRIMINAL IS SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT OKAY. I JUST NEED TO HIT A DIFFERENT STORE EVERY DAY AND AND STATE UNDER NINE HUNDRED BUCKS I'M KINDA. ON AT LIBERTY FROM THE RULE PENALTY OF LAW SO I I THINK. OF MY COLLEAGUE OF MR CHOW FOR BRING THIS BILL BACK AND AND I'M GLAD THAT A HE ASKED ME TO COME BACK TO A TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. YEAH SO I AM. MY COLLEAGUES POINT YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE BILL THAT WAS PASSED THROUGH LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR THAT DEALS WITH THE THEFT RINGS ASSOCIATED WITH AFTER THE STORES THAT WE KNOW ALSO IN MY COMMUNITY IS A LARGE ISSUE HITTING MULTIPLE STORES UNDER NINE HUNDRED NOW. YOU CAN CHARGE THIS WAY. A SPECIFIC PROBLEM WAS BROUGHT TO US WE ADDRESSED IT AND NOW THAT IS. NO LONGER AN ISSUE -- SO THIS IS TRYING TO BROADEN THAT AS I UNDERSTAND IT NOW WHEN I READ. BAILEY IN BAILEY SHE HAD ONE MISS REPRESENTATION RIGHT ONE ACTED THEN BROUGHT IN SEVERAL FUNDS RATE THAT FEELS DISTINCT TO ME FROM WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY WHICH IS MULTIPLE ACTS. THAT ARE DISTINCT AND IN THE LOT INTENTION IMPULSE IN PLAN FEELS. VAGUE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I MEAN. YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TENSION THAT I WANT TO EAT AND SO I STEAL OVER YOU. ARE SIR WHAT IT RATING HOW ARE WE DEFINING THIS SUCH THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT IT WAS IN THE WAY THAT THE CHAIRS BILL. AGGREGATED A VERY CLEAR SITUATION WHERE IT WAS AN ORGANIZED CRIME RING WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM THIS FEELS LIKE IT CAN BE BROADENED IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU HAVE CRIMES COMMITTED. OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME THAT ARE ALL PETTY THEFT AND NOW WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO AGGREGATE. ALL THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION AND I THINK -- THE DISTINCTION IS THAT THE CHAIRS BILL FROM LAST YEAR BASICALLY TARGETED OUR RETAILERS FOR EXAMPLE SHOPLIFTING AT THE RETAIL STORES AND MARSHALL SETTINGS WILD ON THE OTHER HAND THIS PARTICULAR BILL DEALS WITH RESIDENTIAL. ALL PROPERTY CRIME FOR EXAMPLE SO THEY EACH ACTUALLY COMPLEMENT THE OTHER ARE FROM THAT ANGLE NOW AS TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF ONE IMPOSE ONE INTENTION. THAT IS GIVEN AS A JURY INSTRUCTION BY THE JUDGE AND DOT PARTICULARLY -- COULD IN FACT BE PARTED DID THE LAW AS WELL WE'RE NOT TRYING TO EXPAND THE LAW IN ANYWAYS WE ARE JUST SIMPLY TRYING TO CODIFY THE TWO CASES. THAT ARE STILL GOOD LAW AND I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING THAT SAYS THAT THESE TWO CASES HAVE BEEN OVERRULE THE PRIMARILY OFF PRIMARILY ARGUMENT RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION IS AT ALL I AM TRYING. TO A BASICALLY -- ACTED. AGAINST TO WILL OF THE VOTERS BUT WE'RE NOT AMENDING PROP FORTY SEVEN WHATSOEVER AND I THINK THAT IS TO FIND THE STATION AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY LET'S COUNCIL IS HERE AS WELL. I HAVE YET TO SEE ANY LANGUAGE IN ANY CASE OR EITHER IN CASE LAW OR IN PROPOSITION FOR FORTY SEVEN THAT SPECIFICALLY OVERRULE ALL BAILEY OR A COLUMBIA RESEARCH CORPORATION. SO YOU KNOW THE THE LAW IS STILL GOOD I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT ATTEMPTING TO AMEND PROP FORTY SEVEN EIGHT I THINK I INVITE THE CHAIR TO MAYBE INVITE THE OUTLETS COUNCIL COME UP TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IF YOU SO DESIRE. AND I THINK YOU KNOW I THINK WE ARE SIMPLY SAYING THAT IS WHAT THE LAW CURRENTLY IS WHAT TRYING TO CODIFY THAT THOSE WHO CASES TO ALLOW THE PROSECUTORS THE ADDITIONAL ABILITY TO AGGREGATE. ARE ALL THE CELEBRITY CRIMES AND IT'S NOT THAT ARE YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT INVENTING NEW LAW WOULD NOT EXPANDING UPON PROP FORTY SEVEN OR THE CHAIRS LAW LAST YEAR. BECAUSE HIS BASICALLY DEALT WITH THE COMMERCIAL CITING OKAY NICK. GET YOUR DATA MISTER LACKEY SUPER FAST CAN I ASK SORRY I JUST SO I GUESS I'M I'M LOOKING AT THE LAW AND I DON'T SEE IT AS IT APPLIES ONLY TO RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS AS YOU'VE DESCRIBED IS THAT YOUR INTENTION IS AN ACTOR THAT IS IN THERE. RIGHT. YES THAT THAT IS THE INTENTION OF BECAUSE AS FAR AS THE COMMERCIAL SETTING DOT SHOULD BE CAPTURE ALL BY THE CHAIRS UP LAW FROM LAST YEAR. OKAY SO IT'S ALL SETTINGS BESIDES COMMERCIAL I GUESS WOULD BE HOW I WOULD THEN INTERPRET BEST. THAT MY MY UNDERSTANDING FROM LET'S KELSO IS THAT THEY REALLY COULD DO NOT CONFLICT WITH ONE ANOTHER. AND THEN UP THIS BILL DOESN'T REALLY OVER OVERRIDE A RECEIPT PROP FORTY SEVEN OR ANY OTHER CASE LAW SO ALWAYS WE DOING IS TRYING TO CODIFY TWO PIECES. ARE STILL GOOD LAW I MEAN OKAY SHOW ME ONE CASE OR ONE STATEMENT THAT OVERSEE OVERRIDE OR OVER RULES -- ANY OF THE TWO CASES THAT I'M TRYING TO CODIFY THEN I'LL BE I'LL BE I'LL GO AWAY. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR IAGO THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD ACTUALLY IS IT INTERESTING DEBATE. BETWEEN ALL THE LAWYERS AND ALL THE TECHNICAL STUFF THAT'S JUST FINE. BUT AB TEN SIXTY FIVE RESULTS ALL THIS IF LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD JUST. DO THE LAW. WHERE THEY JUST GO AHEAD ARREST PEOPLE ON A MISDEMEANOR CAN EVER GET IT UP IT'S IN MY BILL? THAT'S BEEN PASSED IN SIGN THE PROBLEM IS LAW ENFORCEMENT DON'T WANT TO DO THEIR JOB. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO REST THESE PEOPLE AND THEY CAN GET TO WHERE THEY WANT BUT NO -- THEY WANT TO DO IT A DIFFERENT WAY THEY WANT TO COME BACK AND PUT. BLACK BROWN FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE IN JAIL BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY UNDERSTAND HOW YOU DO WHAT. REHABILITATION WHICH THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN THAT'S HOW YOU DO WHAT DO WHAT DO WHAT FAMILIES THERE AND DEPRESSED. THIS THE SITUATIONS IT IS DRIVING ME CRAZY WE'RE ONLY IN JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH. GIVE MY BILL A CHANCE ONLY BEEN THREE MONTHS TALK TO ME A YEAR FROM NOW ABOUT THE NUMBER OF DEATHS. THAT HAVE HAPPENED OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS THAT'S FINE BUT LET'S GIVE ME BY MONTHS TEN MONTHS OF OF DATA THAT SHOWS THAT MY BILL ACTUALLY WORK WHICH YOU SUPPORTED. GIVEN THE CHANCE YOU WERE TRYING TO DO AN END RUN. TO IT NOW FORGET ABOUT I DON'T NEED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. IT GETS RID OF PROP FORTY SEVEN I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IN RUN IS. AND IT DOESN'T IN RUN ON PROP. FORTY SEVEN AND THAT'S WHY I AM A NO THAT'S WHY I'M A LITTLE UPSET THAT WE I'D I GOT A LOOK AT ALL THESE IN RUNS OFF. FIFTY SEVEN FORTY SEVEN STOP.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I WILL BE BRIEF -- THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. TO THIS BILL IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR LONG STANDING POLICY. OF OPPOSING LEGISLATION.

GROUP OF PEOPLE AVAILABLE FOR JURY SERVICE IN ANY -- ATTEMPTS TO EXCLUDE PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY WILL IMPACT THAT RESPONSIBILITY MOREOVER WE BELIEVE THAT -- THE CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT -- MAKE SUCH CATEGORICAL EXCEPTIONS UNNECESSARY -- AS THE AUTHORIZED COURTS TO GRANT HARDSHIP EXCUSES.
