SOLUTION. BUT IT IS A GOOD STEP

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:42.387
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND AS

00:23:42.454 --> 00:23:44.589
OF THE ONLY TEACHER BOB WAS

00:23:44.656 --> 00:23:46.158
CURRENTLY ON LEAVE AND I MY

00:23:46.224 --> 00:23:47.359
FELLOW TEACHERS WHO PREVIOUSLY

00:23:47.425 --> 00:23:49.127
TAUGHT. WE UNDERSTAND THE

00:23:49.194 --> 00:23:52.063
CONCERNS FIRSTHAND WE DO BUT IT

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:53.698
IS PROJECTED THAT STUDENTS WILL

00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:56.868
FALL BEHIND. NINE MONTHS THAT

00:23:56.935 --> 00:23:59.104
IS AN ENTIRE ACADEMIC HERE. AND

00:23:59.171 --> 00:24:01.039
I ALSO KNOW THE TEACHER THAT

00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:02.507
THEY GAP WILL ONLY GROW

00:24:02.574 --> 00:24:05.110
EXPONENTIALLY AND WE MAY NOT BE

00:24:05.177 --> 00:24:07.279
ABLE TO CATCH UP. OUR STUDENTS

00:24:07.345 --> 00:24:08.814
SO I ASK ALL OF US TO JUST

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.050
CONSIDER. WHAT THIS BILL DOES.

00:24:12.117 --> 00:24:14.686
A GIVE SCHOOLS THE ABILITY TO

00:24:14.753 --> 00:24:16.621
TAKE WHAT WE OFFER. AN OPEN

00:24:16.688 --> 00:24:19.324
SCHOOLS SAFELY. IT DOES GIVE

00:24:19.391 --> 00:24:21.393
FLEXIBILITY WHICH I THOUGHT WAS

00:24:21.459 --> 00:24:22.928
IMPORTANT FOR SOME OF OUR

00:24:22.994 --> 00:24:24.863
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND I WILL

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:26.565

ISSUE BUT THIS IS AS GOOD AS

00:24:37.209 --> 00:24:38.710
FIFTY IN THIS MOMENT. I THINK

00:24:38.777 --> 00:24:40.378

THINK THAT THIS CONVERSATION

00:24:45.817 --> 00:24:48.720
SHOULD NOT STOP HERE. WE NEED

00:24:48.787 --> 00:24:51.356

SCHOOL CAREERS TO BE. AS FOR

00:28:44.923 --> 00:28:47.125

00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:52.997
SIMPLY MOVING OUT OF STATE

STUDENTS FROM OTHER HIGH

00:28:54.132 --> 00:28:54.899
SCHOOLS HAVE MENTIONED THAT

00:28:54.966 --> 00:28:56.034
SCHOOLS BECOME DIFFICULT

00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:58.136
TIRESOME AND MOTIVATIONAL TO AN

00:28:58.203 --> 00:28:59.671
EXTEND FAR BEYOND WHAT YOU MAY

00:28:59.737 --> 00:29:01.473
SEE. THE DEPRESSION RATE IS

00:29:01.539 --> 00:29:03.141
RISING FASTER THAN KEVIN

00:29:03.208 --> 00:29:04.075
NINETEEN SPREADS AND IT IS

00:29:04.142 --> 00:29:05.343
EXTREMELY UNHEALTHY FOR

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.645
TEENAGERS TO BE TRAPPED IN

00:29:07.712 --> 00:29:08.746
THEIR ROOMS FOR LONG PERODS OF

00:29:08.813 --> 00:29:10.748
TIME. WE HAVE LOST ZERO

00:29:10.815 --> 00:29:11.816
STUDENTS IN OUR DISTRICT TO

00:29:11.883 --> 00:29:13.852
KEVIN NINETEEN HOWEVER SINCE

00:29:13.918 --> 00:29:17.722
THE PANDEMIC BEGAN WE HAVE LOST

00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:18.890
THREE STUDENTS TO SUICIDE. TO

00:29:18.957 --> 00:29:20.291
HAVE GOOD HEALTH WE NEED TO GET

00:29:20.358 --> 00:29:21.726
PHYSICAL MENTAL AND SOCIAL WELL

00:29:21.793 --> 00:29:23.561
BEING. SITTING ALL DAY WORKING

00:29:23.628 --> 00:29:24.996
ON SCHOOL WORK IN FRONT OF A

00:29:25.063 --> 00:29:26.431
COMPUTER WITH NO COMMUNICATION

00:29:26.498 --> 00:29:28.333
EXCEPT THREE DEVICE IS NOT

00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:30.368
HEALTHY IT IS MISERABLE. I SIT

00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:31.536
BACK AND WATCH THE PRIVATE

00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:32.837
CHARTER SCHOOLS GO TO SCHOOL IN

00:29:32.904 --> 00:29:34.539
PERSON. AND WONDER WHAT'S GOING

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:36.741
ON. WHAT MAKES PUBLIC SCHOOLS

00:29:36.808 --> 00:29:37.876
ANY DIFFERENT WE BREATHE THE

00:29:37.942 --> 00:29:39.244
SAME AIR SHOP THE SAME STORES

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:41.012
AND WALK ON THE SAME GROUND. SO

00:29:41.079 --> 00:29:43.348
MY QUESTION IS WHAT DO I TELL

00:29:43.414 --> 00:29:44.916
THE STUDENTS I REPRESENT WHO

00:29:44.983 --> 00:29:46.017
DESIRE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL AS

00:29:46.084 --> 00:29:48.620
MUCH AS I DO. AND YOU ALSO.

00:29:48.686 --> 00:29:50.155
HAVE TO BE ON SAM INSTEAD OF

00:29:50.221 --> 00:29:51.789
SITTING AT A DESK WHAT IS THE

00:29:51.856 --> 00:29:54.859
JUSTIFIABLE DELAY. THIS IS JUST

00:29:54.926 --> 00:29:56.961
ONE OF MANY EMAILS THAT I

00:29:57.028 --> 00:29:57.495
RECEIVED FROM HIGH SCHOOL

00:29:57.562 --> 00:29:59.430
STUDENTS AND I'M SURE. MANY OF

00:29:59.497 --> 00:30:02.100
YOU IN THE ROOM HAVE RECEIVED

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:04.435
EMAILS LIKE THIS AS WELL. SO I

00:30:04.502 --> 00:30:06.905
HAVE TO AGREE. WITH MY

00:30:06.971 --> 00:30:07.906
COLLEAGUES AT THE GOVERNOR

00:30:07.972 --> 00:30:11.543
COULD. GO BEYOND THIS BILL IN

00:30:11.609 --> 00:30:13.845
REQUIRING THAT THE SCHOOLS OPEN

00:30:13.912 --> 00:30:14.479
BECAUSE AS THIS BILL SITS RIGHT

00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:17.015
NOW IT DOESN'T. WE NOW REQUIRE

00:30:17.081 --> 00:30:19.017
SCHOOLS TO OPEN. BUT IF THEY DO

00:30:19.083 --> 00:30:20.318
OPEN THEY COULD THEY COULD HAVE

00:30:20.385 --> 00:30:22.187
IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. ONE DAY

00:30:22.253 --> 00:30:25.723
A WEEK. THAT'S THAT'S HARDLY

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:28.560
REALLY MUCH OF AN IMPROVEMENT

00:30:28.626 --> 00:30:29.961
THESE KIDS NEED TO BE BACK IN

00:30:30.028 --> 00:30:33.064
SCHOOL. I'VE I MEAN I'VE GOT

00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:34.299
THREE MY OWN IN HIGH SCHOOL I

00:30:34.365 --> 00:30:35.466
KNOW THERE'S AT LEAST PROBABLY

00:30:35.533 --> 00:30:37.602
HALF OF THIS BODY WHO HAS KIDS

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:39.504

00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:41.039

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:45.143
APPRECIATE AND I APPRECIATE THE

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:47.178
WORK THAT WENT INTO IT. BUT IT

00:30:47.245 --> 00:30:49.681
JUST DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH. MY

00:30:49.747 --> 00:30:51.115
FEAR IS THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO

00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:53.318
SEE KIDS GOING BACK TO ANY TYPE

00:30:53.384 --> 00:30:57.622

00:30:57.689 --> 00:31:00.825
INSTRUCTION. UNTIL NEXT YEAR.

00:31:00.892 --> 00:31:04.529
THAT'S TOO LATE SO I WILL REACH

00:31:04.596 --> 00:31:07.332
ME RELUCTANTLY VOTING FOR THIS

00:31:07.398 --> 00:31:08.266

THESE KIDS ARE GOING THROUGH.

00:31:21.613 --> 00:31:22.880

HOW WE DO THAT HOW DO WE GET

00:31:48.172 --> 00:31:49.674

IS AN INSIDIOUS DISEASE. AND

00:32:00.885 --> 00:32:03.021
THERE ARE NO EASY SOLUTIONS TO

00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:04.822
MY COLLEAGUES WHO WANT US TO

00:32:04.889 --> 00:32:07.358

70% I KNOW THIS ISN'T IT A

00:32:20.538 --> 00:32:23.041
SCIENTIFIC STUDY IT'S ANECDOTAL

00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:25.977
BUT FORTY BETWEEN FORTY AND 70%

00:32:26.044 --> 00:32:28.012
OF PARENTS SAY THEY ARE NOT

00:32:28.079 --> 00:32:28.780
GOING TO SEND THEIR STUDENTS

00:32:28.846 --> 00:32:30.715
BACK BUT THEY DO NOT FEEL SAFE

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:31.816
SENDING THEIR PARENTS. OR

00:32:31.883 --> 00:32:33.785
STUDENTS BACK SO WE HAVE TO

00:32:33.851 --> 00:32:36.654
REMEMBER THAT OUR PARENTS ARE

00:32:36.721 --> 00:32:37.388
GOING TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS

00:32:37.455 --> 00:32:39.223
DECISIONS WHETHER THE SCHOOLS

CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR. IT IS

00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:45.857
STILL CRITICAL TO SUPPORT THE

00:33:45.923 --> 00:33:47.592
SCHOOLS WHEN THEY DO REAL OPEN.

00:33:47.658 --> 00:33:49.093

00:39:25.362 --> 00:39:28.265
PRAYER- ABOUT THE OVER HALF A

00:39:28.332 --> 00:39:31.502
MILLION PEOPLE WHO DIED OF COLD

CODED OR BECOME VERY SICK FROM

CODED. SO THAT'S CERTAINLY A

00:39:45.316 --> 00:39:47.518
VERY REAL RISK IT'S CERTAINLY

00:39:47.585 --> 00:39:49.386
MUCH SMALLER THAN THIS PEOPLE

00:39:49.453 --> 00:39:50.921

WORK AT SCHOOLS. EVEN THE

00:39:55.459 --> 00:39:56.994
CHILDREN THEMSELVES AND THAT'S

00:39:57.061 --> 00:39:57.528
WHY YOU HEAR FROM PARENTS

00:39:57.595 --> 00:39:59.730
SAYING. YOU KNOW I AM TIMES

00:39:59.797 --> 00:40:01.198
CITATIONS ABOUT SENDING MY KIDS

00:40:02.566 --> 00:40:04.468
MY- CHILD NOT DOING SO WELL THE

DISTANCE LEARNING I AM. STILL

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:07.638
NOT THAT EAGER TO SEND MY KIDS

00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:09.140
TO SCHOOL BECAUSE IT'S SO

00:40:09.206 --> 00:40:10.908
IMPORTANT THAT THEY'RE SAFE.

00:40:10.975 --> 00:40:13.144
AND THAT IS. WHY IT'S SO

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:14.812
IMPORTANT THAT- NOT ONLY ARE WE

00:40:14.879 --> 00:40:16.814
PROVIDING RESOURCES THIS BILL

00:40:16.881 --> 00:40:19.016
THAT- I KNOW THAT- BILL THE

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:19.950
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WORKING TO

00:40:20.017 --> 00:40:22.486
TRY TO GET. ACCESS TO GP- FOR

EVEN FREE TV FOR SCHOOL

00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:25.055
DISTRICTS ACCESS TO LOW COST

00:40:25.122 --> 00:40:26.991
TESTING OTHER VERY IMPORTANT

00:40:27.057 --> 00:40:28.759
SAFETY MEASURES. BUT I WOULD

00:40:28.826 --> 00:40:31.929
ALSO- MAKE NOTE THAT- FOR ALL

00:40:31.996 --> 00:40:33.564
THE PEOPLE SO EAGER TO GET KIDS

00:40:33.631 --> 00:40:34.932
BACK TO SCHOOL AND CERTAINLY

00:40:34.999 --> 00:40:36.967
I'M ONE OF THEM- IF THERE'S ANY

00:40:37.034 --> 00:40:37.935
CRITICISM MIGHT MAKE OF THE

00:40:38.002 --> 00:40:40.204
GOVERNOR IS THAT NOT SURE IT'S

00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:41.338
REALLY FAIR ONE. WOULD BE IS

00:40:41.405 --> 00:40:43.374
THAT UNFORTUNATE TOO MANY LOCAL

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.609
OFFICIALS- WE'RE NOT WILLING TO

00:40:45.676 --> 00:40:46.877
ENFORCE VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY

00:40:46.944 --> 00:40:48.245
STANDARDS PREVENT SPREAD THE

00:40:48.312 --> 00:40:50.447
DISEASE LIKE MASKING LIKE

00:40:50.514 --> 00:40:51.916
BUSINESSES ARE APPROPRIATELY

00:40:51.982 --> 00:40:52.983
OPEN. WHERE WE CAN HAVE

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.718
OUTBREAKS AND SPREAD. AND WE

00:40:54.785 --> 00:40:57.621
SAW A HUGE SPIKE IN CASES.

00:40:57.688 --> 00:40:59.557
WHERE OUR HOSPITALS OVER RUN.

00:40:59.623 --> 00:41:01.458
IN DECEMBER AND JANUARY AND

00:41:01.525 --> 00:41:02.493
FORTUNATELY WE'RE NOW IN A

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.427
DOWNTURN SO WE HAVE THIS

00:41:03.494 --> 00:41:04.528
OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO

00:41:04.595 --> 00:41:07.698
REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS SAFELY. SO

00:41:07.765 --> 00:41:09.466
YOU KNOW I DO AGREE WITH THAT

00:41:09.533 --> 00:41:10.901
MY GOOD FRIEND TO SAN FRANCISCO

00:41:10.968 --> 00:41:13.137
WITH THAT- WE NEED TO URGE OUR

00:41:13.204 --> 00:41:16.173
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND OUR- YOU

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.608
KNOW THE- PLACE TO WORK THERE

00:41:17.675 --> 00:41:18.676
AND THE PARENTS TO WORK

00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:20.477
TOGETHER TO GET SCHOOLS BE OPEN

00:41:20.544 --> 00:41:21.912
AGAIN AND CERTAINLY THIS BILL

00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:22.780
IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN GIVING

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:24.148
THEM THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO

00:41:24.215 --> 00:41:26.116
BE ABLE TO DO THAT. SO LET'S GO

00:41:26.183 --> 00:41:27.384
LET'S WORK WITH OUR LOCALS

00:41:27.451 --> 00:41:29.086
LET'S LOOK AT PARENTS WITH WITH

00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:30.754
OUR TEACHERS AND STAFF OR

00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:31.956
SCHOOL LEADERSHIP TO TRY TO GET

00:41:32.022 --> 00:41:33.224
THE SCHOOLS RE OPENED THIS IS

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:34.325
AN IMPORTANT STEP TO MOVING

00:41:34.391 --> 00:41:36.026
FORWARD. BUT ULTIMATELY THIS

00:41:36.093 --> 00:41:37.728
CAN ONLY HAPPEN IF WE ALSO

00:41:37.795 --> 00:41:39.563
CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER. TO

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:41.699
ENSURE THAT WE STOP THE SPREAD

00:41:41.765 --> 00:41:42.800
OF THIS DISEASE THAT MEANS

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:44.268
PROMOTING VACCINATION

SCHOOLS AND I THINK THIS BILL

00:44:44.314 --> 00:44:46.617
DOES STRIKE A GOOD BALANCE

00:44:46.683 --> 00:44:48.185
BETWEEN LOCAL CONTROL AND

00:44:48.252 --> 00:44:50.421

BOARDS I THINK WE NEED TO

00:44:53.624 --> 00:44:55.592
RESPECT THE ELECTED OFFICIALS

00:44:55.659 --> 00:44:57.094

URGING PASSAGE OF THE BILL.

00:45:04.802 --> 00:45:07.604
DESPITE DESPITE SOME CONCERNS

00:45:07.671 --> 00:45:08.605
THOSE ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE A

00:45:08.672 --> 00:45:11.108
HISTORY. OF WORKING OUT

00:45:11.175 --> 00:45:12.643
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ISSUES.

00:45:12.709 --> 00:45:14.878
THOSE DISTRICTS ARE NOT ONE

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:16.713
SIZE FITS ALL SOME OF THEM ARE

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.449
ENTIRELY HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:45:18.515 --> 00:45:19.416

THINK WE- NEED TO RESPECT THAT

00:45:34.631 --> 00:45:37.935
AND I THINK. THE GOOD WORK OF-

00:45:38.001 --> 00:45:39.203
IT'S LEGISLATURE IN THOSE

00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:41.572
CHAIRS HAS RESPECTED THAT LOCAL

00:45:41.638 --> 00:45:44.908
CONTROL. BUT WHAT IF THERE WAS

00:45:44.975 --> 00:45:47.711
NOTHING ELSE. THE CAUSES TO

00:45:47.778 --> 00:45:48.812
SUPPORT THIS BILL WOULD REALLY

00:45:48.879 --> 00:45:50.481
BE THE OTHER PART OF THIS BILL

00:45:50.547 --> 00:45:53.951
THE FOUR POINT SIX. BILLION

00:45:54.017 --> 00:45:56.587
THAT WILL GO TO. BUT THAT WILL

00:45:56.653 --> 00:45:59.656
GO TO XCELERATED OF LEARNING

00:45:59.723 --> 00:46:00.457
THROUGH TUTORING COMMITTEE

00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:02.159
LEARNING HUBS IN A ONE

00:46:02.226 --> 00:46:03.727
EMPHASIZE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:06.163
SUPPORT. ONE THING WE'VE

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:07.464
LEARNED IN OUR HISTORY AS A

00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:10.801
COUNTRY IS THAT. SEPARATE IS

00:46:10.868 --> 00:46:12.736
ALWAYS UNEQUAL. AND I WANT TO

00:46:12.803 --> 00:46:14.404
HARKEN BACK TO THE COMMENTS OF

00:46:14.471 --> 00:46:16.206
MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:18.308
SENATOR DRAWS SO WHAT WE HAVE

00:46:18.375 --> 00:46:19.810
LEARNED FROM THIS PANDEMIC AND

00:46:19.877 --> 00:46:21.778
CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC NOT

00:46:21.845 --> 00:46:23.614
BECAUSE BY THE LEGISLATURE NOT

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.948
BECAUSE BETTER SCHOOL BOARDS

00:46:25.015 --> 00:46:26.783
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED IS. THE

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:30.787
DIGITAL DIVIDE IS VERY REAL. AS

00:46:30.854 --> 00:46:31.922
MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO

00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:33.891
SAID LITTLE BIT EARLIER.

00:46:33.957 --> 00:46:35.092
THERE'S A PUBLIC PRIVATE DIVIDE

00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:37.427
THAT IS VERY REAL. THERE IS AN

00:46:37.494 --> 00:46:39.463
AFFLUENCE AND POVERTY DIVIDE

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:40.797
THAT IS VERY REAL THERE'S A

00:46:40.864 --> 00:46:42.966
RACIAL AND ETHNIC DIVIDE THAT

00:46:43.033 --> 00:46:45.369
IS VERY REAL. AND WE ALSO

00:46:45.435 --> 00:46:47.104
LEARNED FROM THURGOOD MARSHALL

00:46:47.171 --> 00:46:48.539
IS THAT THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT

00:46:48.605 --> 00:46:52.910
DIVIDE. HIS SOCIAL

00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:54.411
PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL

00:46:54.478 --> 00:46:56.947
IMPACT ON THE STUDENTS WHO

00:46:57.014 --> 00:46:59.483
SUFFER THOSE CONSEQUENCES. SO I

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:00.317
THINK THE FOUR POINT SIX

00:47:00.384 --> 00:47:01.418
BILLION DOLLARS IS THE MOST

00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:03.020
IMPORTANT REASON THAT WE

00:47:03.086 --> 00:47:05.122
SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I WOULD

00:47:05.189 --> 00:47:06.924
PREDICT THAT IT WILL BE THE

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:09.426
LAST INVESTMENT. WE NEED TO

00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:11.461
MAKE A TO INVEST ON THE

00:47:11.528 --> 00:47:13.997
RECOVERY OF THE STUDENTS IN THE

00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:01.405
IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND I

00:49:01.471 --> 00:49:03.573
WOULD LIKE TO TIED TOGETHER OF

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:06.343
SOME OF THE THINGS WE HEARD AND

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:08.679
SPEAK TO THEM. BECAUSE WHEN

00:49:08.745 --> 00:49:11.515
THIS DEBATE REALLY STARTED WHEN

00:49:11.581 --> 00:49:13.617
THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED THE RE

00:49:13.684 --> 00:49:16.019
OPENING OF SCHOOLS HIS PROPOSAL

00:49:16.086 --> 00:49:19.556
WAS REALLY DESIGNED TO. MORE

00:49:19.623 --> 00:49:21.792
FORCE SCHOOLS TO OPEN BECAUSE

00:49:21.858 --> 00:49:23.894
THE PANDEMIC WAS SO DEEP AT THE

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.963
TIME IN THE SUBSEQUENT TIME

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:28.799
THINGS HAVE GOTTEN BETTER-

00:49:28.865 --> 00:49:30.767
CASES HAVE DROPPED ACROSS THE

00:49:30.834 --> 00:49:34.237
STATE. AND SO THIS BILL

00:49:34.304 --> 00:49:37.507
REFLECTS BOTH THOSE FACTS IT

00:49:37.574 --> 00:49:39.376
TAKES THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS

00:49:39.443 --> 00:49:41.311
AND REALLY DOES PROVIDE AN

00:49:41.378 --> 00:49:43.180
INCENTIVE TO MOVE PEOPLE TO

00:49:43.246 --> 00:49:45.282
OPEN AND REWARDS THOSE THAT

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:47.417
FOCUS. THE FOUR POINT SIX

00:49:47.484 --> 00:49:48.919
BILLION AND THE OTHER HALF

00:49:48.985 --> 00:49:50.420
WHICH DEALS FOR WHAT HAS BEEN

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:52.689
CALLED LEARNING LOSS REALLY

00:49:52.756 --> 00:49:55.325
DOES GO TO EVERYBODY AND SO IT

00:49:55.392 --> 00:49:57.694
REALLY ENABLES PEOPLE TO OPEN

00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:59.396
BECAUSE ENABLING IS WHAT HAS

00:49:59.463 --> 00:50:03.900
CHANGED IN WHAT HAS GONE ON

00:50:03.967 --> 00:50:05.302
WITH THE PANDEMIC. AND WHEN I

00:50:05.369 --> 00:50:07.537
TALKED IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE.

00:50:07.604 --> 00:50:09.039
WE HAD HEARD FROM SENATOR

00:50:09.106 --> 00:50:11.441
NIELSEN. AND SENATOR NIELSEN IS

00:50:11.508 --> 00:50:13.443
LUCKY COMPARED TO THE MOST OF

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:15.011
US BECAUSE HE REPRESENTS

00:50:15.078 --> 00:50:16.747
COUNTIES THAT HAVE HAD AMONG

00:50:16.813 --> 00:50:18.014
THE LOWEST CASE RATES IN THE

00:50:18.081 --> 00:50:20.717
STATE. AND WE ALSO HEARD FROM

00:50:20.784 --> 00:50:22.219
SENATOR GARAGE SO WHO

00:50:22.285 --> 00:50:24.321
REPRESENTS THE DISTRICT AT THE

00:50:24.388 --> 00:50:26.690
OTHER END. WHERE THE CASES ARE

00:50:26.757 --> 00:50:28.825
HIGHER IT'S MORE DISADVANTAGED

00:50:28.892 --> 00:50:30.560
COMMUNITIES AND THERE IS A REAL

00:50:30.627 --> 00:50:32.362
CONCERN ABOUT COMING BACK IN

00:50:32.429 --> 00:50:34.264
PERSON. THAT I SPOKE TO MY OWN

00:50:34.331 --> 00:50:35.932
DISTRICT WHERE THERE ARE MORE

00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:38.168
AFFLUENT AREAS LESS DIVERSE ON

00:50:38.235 --> 00:50:40.170
THE COAST. AND THEY'RE MORE

00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:42.272
DIVERSE AREAS INTERGENERATIONAL

00:50:42.339 --> 00:50:43.940
FAMILIES MANY THAT WORK ON

00:50:44.007 --> 00:50:46.009
FARMS THAT ARE IN THE IN ONE

00:50:46.076 --> 00:50:47.911
PART OF THE DISTRICT AND BOTH

00:50:47.978 --> 00:50:51.681
ARE REPRESENTED THERE. AND SO.

00:50:51.748 --> 00:50:54.484
WHAT WE HAD TO DO IS CRAFT A

00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:57.020
BILL THAT MATCHED ALL THOSE

00:50:57.087 --> 00:50:58.789
DIFFERENT CONDITIONS. THAT

00:50:58.855 --> 00:51:00.590
MATCHED THE DIFFERENCES THAT

00:51:00.657 --> 00:51:02.426
EXIST THROUGHOUT OUR STATE OF

00:51:02.492 --> 00:51:05.996
FORTY MILLION. AND WE REALLY

00:51:06.062 --> 00:51:09.733
TARGETED- THE KIDS THAT HAVE

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.401
BEEN LEFT OUT DURING THE

00:51:11.468 --> 00:51:13.970
DISTANCE LEARNING WE TARGETED

00:51:14.037 --> 00:51:15.739
THE KIDS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS

00:51:15.806 --> 00:51:17.207
THOSE WITH DISTANCE LEARNING

00:51:17.274 --> 00:51:20.076
PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY

00:51:20.143 --> 00:51:22.245
OR CONNECTIVITY ENGLISH

00:51:22.312 --> 00:51:24.080
LANGUAGE LEARNERS THOSE TO JUST

00:51:24.147 --> 00:51:25.849
SIMPLY DROPPED OUT FOR WHATEVER

00:51:25.916 --> 00:51:28.018
REASON AND THOSE THAT ARE AT

00:51:28.084 --> 00:51:30.554
RISK OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT THOSE

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:31.354
ARE PRIORITIZED IN EACH

00:51:31.421 --> 00:51:33.290
CATEGORY. BUT IT WAS VERY

00:51:33.356 --> 00:51:35.959
SIGNIFICANT THAT SENATOR DORADO

00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:38.195
WALKED OVER TO ME AFTER THAT

00:51:38.261 --> 00:51:40.063
DEBATE WAS DONE AND SAID YOU

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:41.131
KNOW SOME OF US REPRESENT

00:51:41.198 --> 00:51:43.567
SCHOOL DISTRICTS EVERY KID IS

00:51:43.633 --> 00:51:45.669
DISADVANTAGED AND EVERY KID

00:51:45.735 --> 00:51:47.471
NEEDS TO BE A PRIORITY AND SO

00:51:47.537 --> 00:51:50.373
THAT'S WHAT WE TRIED TO ADDRESS

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:54.044
IN THIS BILL AND FOR EXAMPLE IN

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.212
THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION.

00:51:55.278 --> 00:51:56.646
ORIGINALLY THE PROPOSAL WAS

00:51:56.713 --> 00:52:00.584
JUST TO GIVE IT UP TO SCHOOL

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:01.218
DISTRICTS THAT WERE ABOUT READY

00:52:01.284 --> 00:52:03.487
TO OPEN. AND IF YOU DID THAT

00:52:03.553 --> 00:52:04.788
YOU ARE PRIORITIZING

00:52:04.855 --> 00:52:06.957
DISPROPORTIONATELY. MORE

00:52:07.023 --> 00:52:08.792
AFFLUENT DISTRICTS AND YOU WERE

00:52:08.859 --> 00:52:10.861
DISADVANTAGING. THE MORE

00:52:10.927 --> 00:52:12.762
DISADVANTAGED DISTRICTS IN THIS

00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:15.198
BILL WIPES OUT THAT DIFFERENCE

00:52:15.265 --> 00:52:17.267
IT BASICALLY SAYS THAT EVERY

00:52:17.334 --> 00:52:19.503
DISTRICT WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR

00:52:19.569 --> 00:52:21.771
THAT MONEY. THERE WAS A

00:52:21.838 --> 00:52:23.440
QUESTION THAT CAME UP IN THE

00:52:23.507 --> 00:52:25.642
BUDGET DEBATE ABOUT CHARTER

00:52:25.709 --> 00:52:27.177
SCHOOLS AND WHETHER THEY WERE

00:52:27.244 --> 00:52:28.478
DISADVANTAGED AND THE

00:52:28.545 --> 00:52:30.747
DISTINCTION WAS. THAT MANY

00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:32.282
CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE DISTANCE

00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:34.751
LEARNING ALREADY BEFORE THE

00:52:34.818 --> 00:52:37.487
PANDEMIC THEY WEREN'T STOPPING

00:52:37.554 --> 00:52:39.222
THEIR CONTINUING SO THAT

00:52:39.289 --> 00:52:40.991
DOESN'T ADDRESS THAT BUT IT

00:52:41.057 --> 00:52:42.626
WILL HELP CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT

00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:44.728
MAY HAVE BEEN LIKE MANY PUBLIC

00:52:44.794 --> 00:52:46.863
SCHOOLS AND SUSPENDED IN PERSON

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:50.100
ONE. WHEN THE PANDEMIC CAN'T.

00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:53.737
NOW THE REAL PROBLEM IS. TRYING

00:52:53.803 --> 00:52:55.805
TO TAKE A STATE WIDE BILL AND

00:52:55.872 --> 00:52:57.607
NOT HAVING A COOKIE CUTTER

00:52:57.674 --> 00:53:00.277
APPROACH AND IT WAS SUGGESTED

00:53:00.343 --> 00:53:04.314
EARLIER THAT WE SHOULD MANDATE-

00:53:04.381 --> 00:53:05.282
CERTAIN NUMBER OF DAYS BEING

00:53:05.348 --> 00:53:07.918
OPEN. WELL THERE'S A CONSISTENT

00:53:07.984 --> 00:53:09.920
STANDARD IN THIS BILL ON THE

00:53:09.986 --> 00:53:10.353
CONSISTENT STANDARDS

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:14.558
FLEXIBILITY FOR EXAMPLE. IF WE

00:53:14.624 --> 00:53:18.094
HAD A CLASSROOM THAT WAS SO BIG.

00:53:18.161 --> 00:53:18.995
THAT YOU CAN'T SOCIALLY

00:53:19.062 --> 00:53:20.697
DISTANCE AND BRING THE WHOLE

00:53:20.764 --> 00:53:22.899
CLASS BACK TOGETHER YOU COULD

00:53:22.966 --> 00:53:24.568
HAVE HALF THE WEEK IN PERSON

00:53:24.634 --> 00:53:26.069
FOR HALF THE CLASS HALF THE

00:53:26.136 --> 00:53:27.304
WEEK IN PERSON FOR THE OTHER

00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:29.272
HALF OF THE CLASS. DISTANCE

00:53:29.339 --> 00:53:30.373
WARNING WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:32.943
PERSON AND IF WE FORCED THEM TO

00:53:33.009 --> 00:53:34.945
OPEN IT WOULD HAVE THE

00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:37.280
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE SINCE

00:53:37.347 --> 00:53:38.782
THEY ALL CAN'T FIT IN THE CLASS

00:53:38.848 --> 00:53:41.051
OF PROBABLY KEEP MATH CLASS

00:53:41.117 --> 00:53:43.186
CLOSED UNTIL VAT AS WHY THE

00:53:43.253 --> 00:53:45.288
CONSISTENT STANDARD IS

00:53:45.355 --> 00:53:47.857
FLEXIBILITY SO AS WAS SAID BY

00:53:47.924 --> 00:53:50.093
SENATOR CORTESE WITH UP TO

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.661
SCHOOL BOARDS DECIDE WITH WHAT

00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:55.432
THE LOCALS DECIDE. HOW IT BEST

00:53:55.498 --> 00:53:57.901
FOR. AND SENATOR PAM. I WAS

00:53:57.968 --> 00:53:59.536
VERY CONCERNED AS A MEDICAL

00:53:59.603 --> 00:54:02.772
PROFESSIONAL WE DON'T LEGISLATE

00:54:02.839 --> 00:54:05.675
THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE THAT

00:54:05.742 --> 00:54:06.209
WAS ALSO SUGGESTED EARLIER

00:54:06.276 --> 00:54:10.246
TODAY AND IT REALLY LEAVES IT

00:54:10.313 --> 00:54:11.548
TO THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS

00:54:11.615 --> 00:54:14.451
THIS BILL REFERENCES REQUIRED

00:54:14.517 --> 00:54:14.951
OR IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:54:15.018 --> 00:54:17.120
GUIDANCE BUT IT DOESN'T DICTATE

00:54:17.187 --> 00:54:19.055
WHAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE

00:54:19.122 --> 00:54:20.857
IS AND THERE WAS SOME

00:54:20.924 --> 00:54:23.627
FLEXIBILITY AND THAT. THE

00:54:23.693 --> 00:54:25.295
PEOPLE PREPARING THE MEDICAL

00:54:25.362 --> 00:54:26.529
PROFESSIONALS PREPARING THE

00:54:26.596 --> 00:54:30.333
GUIDANCE SAID YOU SHOULD DO SIX

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.369
FEET DIFFERENCE FOR STUDENTS

00:54:32.435 --> 00:54:33.803
BUT IF YOU MAKE A GOOD FAITH

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:36.506
EFFORT AND YOU CAN'T SATISFY

00:54:36.573 --> 00:54:38.675
IT. YOU COULD GO AS LOW AS FOUR

00:54:38.742 --> 00:54:40.343
SO THEY RECOGNIZED THAT

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:44.014
FLEXIBILITY THAT WAS THERE. THE

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.416
END IT IS ALSO TRUE. THERE WAS

00:54:46.483 --> 00:54:48.485
A MISREPRESENTATION IN A COLUMN

00:54:48.551 --> 00:54:50.754
IN THE LA TIMES THAT IMPLIED

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:52.789
THAT VACCINATIONS WERE REQUIRED

00:54:52.856 --> 00:54:55.425
AS PART OF THIS BILL. THEY ARE

00:54:55.492 --> 00:54:59.896
NOT IT IS OUR PRIORITIZATION

00:54:59.963 --> 00:55:05.735
AND THE CDC. CHURCH AND SCHOOL

00:55:05.802 --> 00:55:07.837
EMPLOYEES. WE SHOULD RETURN

00:55:07.904 --> 00:55:09.472
REQUIRE IT THIS BILL IS

00:55:09.539 --> 00:55:11.274
CONSISTENT WITH THAT CDC

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:12.542
GUIDANCE IN PRESIDENT BIDEN

00:55:12.609 --> 00:55:14.477
SAYS WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE

00:55:14.544 --> 00:55:16.846
SCHOOL EMPLOYEES THIS BILL IS

00:55:16.913 --> 00:55:19.215
CONSISTENT WITH FACT. THE END

00:55:19.282 --> 00:55:21.184
AND SO IT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE

00:55:21.251 --> 00:55:24.754
IN THE END. FINALLY THERE ARE

00:55:24.821 --> 00:55:27.490
REAL CONCERNS. ABOUT DIFFERENT

00:55:27.557 --> 00:55:29.759
GROUPS AND HOW THEY MIGHT HAVE

00:55:29.826 --> 00:55:32.028
BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS BILL OR

00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:33.997
HOW THE BILL MIGHT AFFECT THEM.

00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:35.398
AND THERE WAS A CONCERN IN THE

00:55:35.465 --> 00:55:37.600
BUDGET COMMITTEE. FETID

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:39.636
MINISTRATIONS OF MARK TO IN

00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:43.807
THIS PROCESS. THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:55:43.873 --> 00:55:46.042
THERE'S NO PENALTY AND THERE

00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:47.444
WAS A REALLY PROTECTION FOR

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:48.378
SCHOOLS THAT HAVE ALREADY

00:55:48.445 --> 00:55:50.480
OPENED THEY GET TO CONTINUE

00:55:50.547 --> 00:55:52.382
THEYRE NOT PENALIZED AND

00:55:52.449 --> 00:55:54.417
REQUIRED TO CLOSE. THIS DOES

00:55:54.484 --> 00:55:56.453
NOT REINVENT THE WHEEL FOR

00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:59.189
TESTING. THIS ALLOWS A LOCAL

00:55:59.255 --> 00:56:02.692
TESTING. ABILITY TO JUST BE

00:56:02.759 --> 00:56:04.794
SIGNED OFF ON AND CONTINUE AND

00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:06.429
BY THE WAY SINCE WE HAD THE

00:56:06.496 --> 00:56:08.298
BUDGET DEBATE ON TUESDAY. THERE

00:56:08.364 --> 00:56:10.533
WAS APPROVAL OF MEDICAID

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.469
REIMBURSEMENT FOR LOWER INCOME

00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:14.771
STUDENTS AND TESTING AND THAT

00:56:14.838 --> 00:56:16.072
WILL BRING MORE MONEY TO THE

00:56:16.139 --> 00:56:18.708
TABLE FOR THIS RE OPENING. IN

00:56:18.775 --> 00:56:20.844
THE DISTRICTS AND WITH THE

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:22.378
STUDENTS THAT NEED IT MOST-

00:56:22.445 --> 00:56:24.047
THERE ALSO IS NO APPLICATION

00:56:24.114 --> 00:56:25.515
PROCESS WE DON'T WANT TO SLOW

00:56:25.582 --> 00:56:29.119
DOWN. ARE WE REALLY WANTED THIS

00:56:29.185 --> 00:56:29.719
TO BE ABLE TO MOVE AND GET OUT

00:56:29.786 --> 00:56:32.188
THE DOOR. THEY DON'T HAVE TO

00:56:32.255 --> 00:56:33.456
THE DISTRICT'S REDO THEIR

00:56:33.523 --> 00:56:35.091
COVERT PLAN IF THEY HAVE AN

00:56:35.158 --> 00:56:36.659
EXISTING ONE THAT WAS APPROVED

00:56:36.726 --> 00:56:38.328
IN. AND BARGAINED IT JUST

00:56:38.394 --> 00:56:40.764
CONTINUES NO REINVENTING THE

00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:42.632
WHEEL. AND I KNOW CENTRO

00:56:42.699 --> 00:56:44.834
TROUBLED WAS VERY CONCERNED.

00:56:44.901 --> 00:56:47.670
ABOUT THE OFFER THE APPROVAL

00:56:47.737 --> 00:56:51.574
PROCESS- THAT WOULD GO ON BY.

00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:52.609
OF CERTAIN PLAN AND THERE'S A

00:56:52.675 --> 00:56:55.011
TRIGGER THAT HALF OF AFTER FIVE

00:56:57.747 --> 00:56:59.682
NOT A BUREAUCRATIC DELAY HERE

00:56:59.749 --> 00:57:01.117

THERE WAS A CONCERN REYES TO

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:03.553
MANY OF THE MEMBERS ON THE

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:05.388
FLOOR. THAT THE BILL WOULD

00:57:05.455 --> 00:57:07.423
PENALIZE INDEPENDENT STUDIES

00:57:08.992 --> 00:57:11.928
TAKEN OUT. OF AND THE BILL IS

00:57:11.995 --> 00:57:14.531
GOOD AND THAT IS WHY WE ALL GOT

00:57:14.597 --> 00:57:16.132
LETTERS FROM ALMOST EVERY

00:57:16.199 --> 00:57:18.168

IS TO RING THAT ALLOWSSTEP ONE

00:57:39.856 --> 00:57:41.624
FOR ONE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION

00:57:41.691 --> 00:57:43.126
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS OF

00:57:43.193 --> 00:57:45.962
GREAT CONCERN. THE VACCINES%

00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:47.430
THAT WAS ADDED SINCE IT WAS

00:57:47.497 --> 00:57:49.265
FIRST PROPOSED IN THE WAY I

00:57:49.332 --> 00:57:51.067
PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED THAT

00:57:51.134 --> 00:57:53.036
PROVIDE SOME OF THE FEARS ABOUT

00:57:53.102 --> 00:57:54.504
SCHOOL EMPLOYEES AND TEACHERS

00:57:54.571 --> 00:57:59.409
GOING BACK. WE REQUIRE THAT

00:57:59.475 --> 00:58:00.009
THERE BE TESTING IN THE PURPLE

00:58:00.076 --> 00:58:03.379
TEAR. WE REQUIRE THE PUBLIC

00:58:03.446 --> 00:58:04.914
HEALTH GUIDANCE WHICH REQUIRES

00:58:04.981 --> 00:58:07.584
THE TESTING AND THAT IS TO GIVE

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:09.819
SOME ASSURANCE TO ANY TEACHER

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:11.187
OR SCHOOL EMPLOYEE THAT MIGHT

00:58:11.254 --> 00:58:13.489
HAVE TO RETURN IN THE EARLY

00:58:13.556 --> 00:58:15.291
CORPORATION PURPLE. AND ALSO

00:58:15.358 --> 00:58:16.626
THIS BILL FROM THE FIRST

00:58:16.693 --> 00:58:18.661
INCARNATION BEEPS UP

00:58:18.728 --> 00:58:21.431
ENFORCEMENT BEATS UP TACTICAL

00:58:21.497 --> 00:58:23.299
SYSTEMS SO THAT THE SCHOOL

00:58:23.366 --> 00:58:24.434
DISTRICTS ARE NOT LEFT BY

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:25.735
THEMSELVES THE PEOPLE ARE

00:58:25.802 --> 00:58:28.404
LOOKING TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE

00:58:28.471 --> 00:58:29.339
THINGS THAT ARE SPELLED OUT IN

00:58:29.405 --> 00:58:34.043
THIS. THE BILL FORD HERE TO SO

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:34.611
AS I SAID IN FRONT OF THE

00:58:34.677 --> 00:58:37.480
BUDGET COMMITTEE THIS WAS HARD.

00:58:37.547 --> 00:58:38.982
THIS WAS HARD BECAUSE WE HAD TO

00:58:39.048 --> 00:58:42.018
DO A SENATOR LEYVA REFER TO.

00:58:42.085 --> 00:58:43.052
OVER A THOUSAND SCHOOL

00:58:43.119 --> 00:58:45.555
DISTRICTS STATEWIDE DISTRICTS

00:58:45.622 --> 00:58:47.223
OF EVERY ECONOMIC STATUS

00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:49.826
DISTRICT OF EVERY LEVEL OF THE

00:58:49.893 --> 00:58:53.029
PANDEMIC DISTRICTS THAT WANT TO

00:58:53.096 --> 00:58:55.231
TEACH THEIR STUDENTS BECAUSE IT

00:58:55.298 --> 00:58:56.900
WAS MENTIONED ABOUT THE MENTAL

00:58:56.966 --> 00:58:58.268
HEALTH OF STUDENTS AND I HAVE

00:58:58.334 --> 00:58:59.903
TO SAY. WHEN I FIRST HAD A

00:58:59.969 --> 00:59:01.337
CONVERSATION ABOUT SCHOOL RE

00:59:01.404 --> 00:59:04.107
OPENING WHITE BEFORE EVEN THE

00:59:04.173 --> 00:59:04.607
GOVERNOR PROPOSED THE RE

00:59:04.674 --> 00:59:06.743
OPENING. IT WAS LIKE WHY WOULD

00:59:06.809 --> 00:59:09.212
WE RE OPEN FOR SIX WEEKS. AFTER

00:59:09.279 --> 00:59:11.147
BEING HIT DISTANCE LEARNING FOR

00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:12.482
SEVEN MONTHS AND THE ANSWER

00:59:12.548 --> 00:59:15.485
WAS. THAT SOCIALIZATION IS SO

00:59:15.551 --> 00:59:17.553
IMPORTANT TO THE STUDENTS BUT

00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:19.322
GETTING BACK BEING WITH THEIR

00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:21.324
PEERS WOULD BE THE BIGGEST HELP

00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:23.526
TO MENTAL HEALTH AND PERSONAL

00:59:23.593 --> 00:59:25.795
HELP. AS WHAT THE INSTRUCTIONS

00:59:25.862 --> 00:59:27.897
SO I THINK THIS BILL ADDRESSES

00:59:27.964 --> 00:59:30.199
ALMOST EVERY ISSUE THAT WAS

00:59:30.266 --> 00:59:31.567
BROUGHT TO US IN THIS PROCESS

00:59:31.634 --> 00:59:33.770
IT MOVES US AHEAD. I THINK IT'S

00:59:33.836 --> 00:59:35.405
A GOOD BILL GOT UNANIMOUS

00:59:35.471 --> 00:59:37.073
SUPPORT IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE

FURTHER MIKE SO I THINK WE CAN

00:59:44.814 --> 00:59:47.183
CONCLUDE ON WHAT WE WILL ALL

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:49.285
AGREE WITH A HEALTHY DEBATE.

00:59:49.352 --> 00:59:49.886

THE DISCUSSION ON THE FLOOR SO

00:59:56.759 --> 00:59:58.928
FAR AND I THINK WHAT IS EVIDENT

00:59:58.995 --> 01:00:01.097
FROM WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED IS

01:00:01.164 --> 01:00:04.033
THAT DETAILS MATTER. AS MANY

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.568
PARENTS WANT THEIR CHILDREN

01:00:05.635 --> 01:00:07.570
BACK IN THE CLASSROOM THERE ARE

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:09.772
JUST AS MANY WHO ARE AFRAID AND

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:11.874
AFRAID WITH GOOD REASON. THE

01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:13.309
PANDEMIC AS OUR FOR OUR

01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:15.345
COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO THE

01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:17.380
GOOD DOCTOR REMINDED US. HAS

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.582
KILLED OVER HALF A MILLION

01:00:19.649 --> 01:00:23.219
PEOPLE AND LEFT MILLIONS WITH

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:24.854
THE LONG TERM HEALTH PROBLEMS.

01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:27.223
ANY DISTRESSED ALL OF US THERE

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:29.025
IS NO ONE WHO IS NOT BEEN

01:00:29.092 --> 01:00:31.728
HARMED BY THIS PANDEMIC. AND W

01:00:31.794 --> 01:00:34.163
WILL NOT BE ON STRESSED OR

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:36.199
UNHARMED UNTIL WE CURB ITS

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:38.935
SPREAD. AND WE CAN ONLY CURB

01:00:39.002 --> 01:00:42.071
ITS SPREAD IF WE FOLLOW THE

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:44.974
APPROPRIATE SAFETY PROTOCOLS

01:00:45.041 --> 01:00:46.342
AND THAT IS EVERYWHERE

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:50.680
INCLUDING OUR SCHOOLS AND WE

01:00:50.747 --> 01:00:52.515
KNOW THAT OUR- STAFF OR

01:00:52.582 --> 01:00:54.484
TEACHERS OR PARENTS OR

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:56.819
CHILDREN. ARE NOT GOING TO FEEL

01:00:56.886 --> 01:00:59.022
COMFORTABLE RETURNING TO IN

01:00:59.088 --> 01:01:01.524
PERSON INSTRUCTION UNLESS THEY

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:02.425
FEEL SOME CONFIDENCE THAT IT'S

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:05.395
SAFE. AND WE HAVE DONE OUR BEST

01:01:05.461 --> 01:01:10.666
TO PROVIDE THAT- BY. ALLOWING

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:12.402
ACCESS TO VACCINATIONS NOT

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:14.670
REQUIRING THEM BUT ALLOWING

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:17.774
THAT ACCESS BY. REQUIRING

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.243
CERTAIN TESTING PROTOCOLS IN

01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:21.778
THOSE AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:23.913
POVERTY RATES AND BY REQUIRING

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.048
THE DISTANCE IN THE OTHER

01:01:25.114 --> 01:01:26.582
MEASURES THAT WE KNOW ARE

01:01:26.649 --> 01:01:29.118
NEEDED WE ALSO KNOW THAT NOT

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:31.554
ALL CLASSROOMS OR SCHOOLS ARE

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:33.589
DESIGNED THE SAME OR HAVE THE

01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:36.726
SAME CAPACITIES IF FOR EXAMPLE

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:39.429
THE CDC ITSELF POINTS OUT THAT

01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:41.197
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE INDOORS

01:01:41.264 --> 01:01:42.698
THE ABSOLUTELY BEST

01:01:42.765 --> 01:01:44.467
CIRCUMSTANCE IS ONE WHERE

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.402
WINDOWS ARE OPEN AND A GREAT

01:01:46.469 --> 01:01:48.805
VENTILATION SYSTEM. I KNOW EACH

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:51.207
AND EVERYONE OF US CAN GO TO

01:01:51.274 --> 01:01:53.076
ONE SCHOOL IN OUR DISTRICT AND

01:01:53.142 --> 01:01:54.710
SHOULD POINT OUT OF CLASSROOM

01:01:54.777 --> 01:01:56.746
MANY CLASSROOMS FOR WHICH THE

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:58.948
WINDOWS CANNOT OPEN AND THERE

01:01:59.015 --> 01:02:00.883
IS NOT A GOOD VENTILATION

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:03.286
SYSTEM. SO IT IS OUR

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:05.855
RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE

01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:08.324
THAT THOSE DETAILS ARE DRESSED

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:09.559
AND THAT WE HAVE SET UP A

01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:11.961
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE PEOPLE CAN

01:02:12.028 --> 01:02:15.064
FEEL SAFE WHICH WE HAVE DONE

01:02:15.131 --> 01:02:18.267
ARENDT. WE ARE NOT RE OPENING

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:21.971
