OF THE AIDS. CRISIS IN THE

00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:53.450
NINETEEN EIGHTIES NINETEN

00:40:53.517 --> 00:40:55.152
NINETIES WHEN IT WAS COMPLETELY

00:40:55.219 --> 00:40:57.154
ILLEGAL AND THE CITY FINALLY

00:40:57.221 --> 00:41:00.157
WAS. ABLE TO GET AUTHORIZATION

FROM THE STATE BUT- YOU KNOW

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.095
THIS IS- THERE IT'S AN

00:41:05.162 --> 00:41:05.963
IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.998
INTERVENTION BY EVEN SOME

00:41:08.065 --> 00:41:08.933

HAVEENDED UP IMPLEMENTING

00:41:12.503 --> 00:41:15.039
THESE PROGRAMS WHEN HIV EVEN

00:41:15.105 --> 00:41:20.644
RUNS OUT OF CONTROL- AMONG IV

00:41:20.711 --> 00:41:21.579
DRUG USER POPULATIONS- AND SO

00:41:21.645 --> 00:41:24.481
UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH WE SEE-

CONTINUING PUSH BACK FROM SOME

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:29.119
IN THE COMMUNITY- AND I THINK

00:41:29.186 --> 00:41:30.521
SOMETIMES THERE'S THIS FALSE

00:41:30.588 --> 00:41:32.289
PERCEPTION THAT. HAVING A

NEEDLE EXCHANGE ANY OF THIS TO

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:36.093
BE SOME PROGRAM IS SOMEHOW

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.661
GOING TO CAUSE PEOPLE TO START

00:41:37.728 --> 00:41:39.663
INJECTING. DRUGS WHICH IS

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:40.698
COMPLETELY FALSE THEY'RE

00:41:40.764 --> 00:41:43.467
ALREADY INJECTING DRUGS AND IF

00:41:43.534 --> 00:41:44.568
THEY'RE GOING TO DROP THOSE

00:41:44.635 --> 00:41:46.437
DEALS IN THE GROUND THEY'RE

00:41:46.503 --> 00:41:49.006
GOING TO DO IT WHETHER OR NOT-

00:41:49.073 --> 00:41:51.242
A NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM.

00:41:51.308 --> 00:41:53.177
EXISTS THE IDEA THAT THESE

00:41:53.244 --> 00:41:55.446
PROGRAMS ARE FUELING A SYRINGE

00:41:55.512 --> 00:41:57.314
LETTER. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT

00:41:57.381 --> 00:41:58.949
FRUSTRATES SAN FRANCISCANS AS

00:41:59.016 --> 00:42:00.517
MUCH AS A FRUSTRATED ANYONE NO

00:42:00.584 --> 00:42:01.518
ONE WANTS TO SEE NEEDLES ON THE

00:42:01.585 --> 00:42:04.955
GROUND BUT- THAT THAT IS NOT

00:42:05.022 --> 00:42:05.656
CONNECTED TO WHETHER THERE'S A

00:42:05.723 --> 00:42:08.425
NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM PEOPLE

00:42:08.492 --> 00:42:09.026

00:42:09.093 --> 00:42:09.627
IT OR THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO

00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:14.765
IT- AND HONESTLY LIKE THE IDEA

00:42:14.832 --> 00:42:15.599
OF. TAKING SO SEQUEL- IS- THE

00:42:15.666 --> 00:42:16.667
IDEA THIS WOULD EVER BE IN

00:42:16.734 --> 00:42:19.270

HEALTH MOST PACIFIC LEE ON THIS

00:48:51.795 --> 00:48:54.364
AND WE KNOW. THAT THERE IS A

00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:56.667
LARGE INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF

00:48:56.733 --> 00:48:59.536
A HIV AIDS THAT IS IT THAT THAT

00:48:59.603 --> 00:49:01.138
THAT IS CREATED AS WELL AS

00:49:01.204 --> 00:49:03.240
ABSENCES AND INJURIES. FROM

00:49:03.307 --> 00:49:05.075

AND I GUESS IT ALSO JUST AT IT

00:49:10.914 --> 00:49:13.817
THIS ALSO GIVES THEM SOME OF

00:49:13.884 --> 00:49:14.384
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LOT OF

00:49:14.451 --> 00:49:16.687
THEM. CONCERNS ABOUT. NEEDLES

00:49:16.753 --> 00:49:18.388
OUT IN PUBLIC WHICH IS WRONG

00:49:18.455 --> 00:49:19.489
NOBODY WANTS THAT NOBODY WANTS

00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:21.992
THAT AT ALL- THAT ANOTHER

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:23.193
POLICY THAT HAS BEEN BEFORE

THIS. COMMITTEE ON SAFE

00:49:25.195 --> 00:49:26.229
INJECTION SITES AND IS NOW

00:49:26.296 --> 00:49:27.731
MOVING TO THE OTHER HOUSE

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:30.200
PERHAPS IS. ANOTHER ARGUMENT

00:49:30.267 --> 00:49:33.203
FOR. THAT LEGISLATION BECAUSE

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.804
THEN IT NEEDLES ARE NOT LEFT

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:36.473
AROUND. AND JUST THOUGHT ON

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.675
THAT SAME TOPIC WHEN WE TALK

00:49:38.742 --> 00:49:39.242
ABOUT NEEDLES AND AN IV DRUG

00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:42.112
USE. WE KNOW RIGHT NOW AND

00:49:42.179 --> 00:49:44.147
WE'VE KNOWN FOR AWHILE THAT

00:49:44.214 --> 00:49:45.649
FICTIONAL WHICH WAS MOSTLY ON

00:49:45.716 --> 00:49:47.084
THE EAST COAST HAS NOW MADE ITS

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:48.919
WAY TO CALIFORNIA. AND SO THE

00:49:48.985 --> 00:49:50.354
AMOUNT OF OVERDOSES THAT WE'RE

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.688
SEEING AND WILL CONTINUE TO SEE

00:49:51.755 --> 00:49:53.523
AND THE COMPLICATIONS FROM THAT

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:56.026
ARE ONLY GOING TO GROW. AGAIN

00:49:56.093 --> 00:49:58.829
LEADING TO THE SUPPORT OF A OF

00:49:58.895 --> 00:50:00.030
THE SAFE INJECTION SITES BILL

00:50:00.097 --> 00:50:02.499
AS IT MOVES FORWARD SO- I THINK

00:50:02.566 --> 00:50:05.702
IT INSTEAD THE- INTERESTING
