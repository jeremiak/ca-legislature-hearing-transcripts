CURRENTLY I'M A PRACTICING INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGISTS. I WAS APPOINTED TO THE BOARD IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND THE SERVER AS SECRETARY TREASURER OF THE BOARD FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS. I AM BUSY SEEING PATIENTS IN MY OFFICE AND IN THE HOSPITAL ON A DAILY BASIS BUT I DO MAKE TIME. FOR THE OSTEOPATHIC MEDICAL BOARD BUSINESS BECAUSE I AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE BORDER DEDICATED TO THE BOARD'S PRIMARY MISSION OF PUBLIC PROTECTION- TODAY FOR YOU TO DEMONSTRATE THAT COMMITMENT. THE BOARD'S MISSION IS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC BY REQUIRING COMPETENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND INTEGRITY IN THE SAFE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE BY OSTEOPATHIC PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS. TO ACCOMPLISH ITS MISSION THE BOARD INVESTIGATES CONSUMER COMPLAINTS AND CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS. RESPONSE TO EMERGING CHANGES AND TRENDS IN THE OSTEOPATHIC HEALTHCARE PROFESSION LEGISLATIVELY OR THROUGH REGULATIONS. VIDEOS ARE FULLY LICENSED PHYSICIANS WHO PRACTICED IN EVERY MEDICAL SPECIALTY. DEOS PRACTICE A WHOLE PERSON APPROACH TO MEDICINE FOCUSED ON LOOKING BEYOND SYMPTOMS TO UNDERSTAND HOW LIFESTYLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS IMPACT WELL BEING. VIDEO PROFESSIONALS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING SEGMENTS OF HEALTHCARE WITH ONE OUT OF EVERY FOUR MEDICAL STUDENTS ENROLLED IN OSTEOPATHIC MEDICAL SCHOOL. THE NUMBER OF DEALS IN CALIFORNIA HAS INCREASED FROM APPROXIMATELY. NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIX TO TWELVE THOUSAND SIXTY EIGHT CENTS THIS TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SUNSET REVIEW. THIS REPRESENTS A 31% INCREASE IN THE LICENSEE POPULATION. THE AUTOMATIC MEDICAL BORDERS A SMALL PROGRAM UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS WE TAKE PRIDE IN FULFILLING THE BOARD'S MISSION OF PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. WE HOLD OUR LICENSEES TO A HIGH STANDARD AND TAKE SWIFT APPROPRIATE ACTION WHEN NECESSARY. WE CONSISTENTLY SETTLED CASES AT OR ABOVE THE DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES. THE OSTEOPATHIC% MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA IS IN SUPPORT OF CONTINUED LICENSING ORIGINAL IT REGULATION BY THE CURRENT O. M. D. C. MEMBERSHIP. THE- MBC IS A GROWING PROFESSION WITH A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO MEDICINE THEN THE MD COUNTERPARTS. ADDITIONALLY AS AN INITIATIVE CREATED BOARD WITH SPECIFIC LAWS ABOUT THE STAB WISHING GOVERN THE BOARD YES THE PADDOCK MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA HAS SOLE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE DEOS IN CALIFORNIA. CONSIDERING THE GROWING PROFESSION AND A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO MEDICINE DEOS SHOULD BE LICENSED AND REGULATED BY THE OSTEOPATHIC MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. I WILL DO MY BEST TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS TODAY TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY. AND AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE BOARD'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. DOUG MISTER MARQUITA. MISTREAT- YOU MAY PROCEED. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE THANK YOU TO THE HONOR ROLL CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MARKET- I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE OSTEOPATHIC MEDICAL BOARD SINCE JANUARY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE TO REPRESENT THE BOARD TODAY. MY VISION FOR THE BORDERS TO CONTINUE TO FULFILL THE MISSION OF PROTECTING THE PUBLIC- THE- PRACTICE OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE IS A GROWING PROFESSION I'M EXCITED TO SEE THIS CONTENT CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD. THE BOARD DOES NOT HAVE ANY ISSUES FROM A BUDGET PERSPECTIVE OUR BUDGET IS STRUCTURALLY BALANCED IN OUR REVENUE AND EXPENDITURES ARE FAIRLY CONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER THEREFORE THE BOARD WILL NOT NEED TO PROCEED WITH A FEE INCREASE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. ADDITIONALLY SINCE OUR OUR BUDGET IS STRUCTURALLY SOUND THE BOARD WAS ABLE TO ABSORB THE ATTORNEY GENERAL RATE INCREASES WITH OUR EXISTING RESOURCES. SINCE THE LAST SUNSET REVIEW THE BOARD. REGULATES A NEW LICENSE TYPE THE POSTGRADUATE TRAINING LICENSE. BOARD INITIALLY HAD CONCERNS OVER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL BUT FULLY SUPPORTS THE CONSUMER PROTECTION TENSION OF THE BILL. ADDITIONALLY THE BOARD HASBEEN MADE MADE AWARE OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE. ARISEN AS A RESULT OF THE BILL- BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT ANY CHANGES TO THE LOG- MAY UNDERMINE CONSUMER PROTECTION. KOPEN NINETEEN IS CREATED AN UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION FOR THE BOARD. OUR DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN ENSURING THAT OUR NEEDS ARE MET. WITH THEIR OPEN COMMUNICATION AND GUIDANCE- THERE BEEN SEVERAL WAIVERS ISSUE TO ENSURE THAT KOBE DID NOT CREATE A BARRIER FOR LICENSURE. ON THE BOARDS AND- WE IMPLEMENTED TELEWORKING. A STAFFER TATIAN SCHEDULES AND- STAFFERDECENT SCHEDULES AND ROTATIONAL- OFFICER VISITS TO ENSURE THAT THE CLOVER NINETEEN PROTOCOLS WERE MET ADDITIONALLY THE DEPARTMENT'S I. T. TEAM WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN ENSURING THAT ALL OF MY STAFF HAD ACCESS TO THE NETWORK REMOTELY- SO TELEWORKING WAS- SEAMLESS. I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY- AND AT THIS TIME WILL TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU- MISTREAT- ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF OUR COMMITTEES. FOR THE PANELISTS ON THIS PARTICULAR BOARD. LET ME JUST ASK A COUPLE. PERHAPS ONE OF YOU COULD TO COULD. REVIEW FOR ME ANY ISSUES THAT YOU SEE YOU ARE EXPERIENCING IT AGAIN IF ANY WITH THE POST GRADUATE TRAINING LICENSE. I'LL GO AHEAD ASK MARK TO TRY FAIL THIS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS A GREAT QUESTION SO THERE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME ISSUES THAT HAVE ARISEN AS A RESULT OF THE POST GRADUATE TRAINING LICENSE- WE ACTUALLY HAVEN'T RECEIVED THAT MANY OF THE COMPLAINTS I'M AWARE OF ON THERE'S THE MOON LIGHTING ISSUE- WITH- WITH. DOCTORS WORKING OUTSIDE OF THE PROGRAM AND RECEIVING AUTHORIZATION- FROM THEIR PROGRAM DIRECTOR- THERE'S THE ISSUE OF OBTAINING- THE D. A. AXE- CERTIFICATE. AS WELL- BUT- WE ACTUALLY HAVEN'T RECEIVED TOO MANY OF THOSE COMPLAINTS AT AT- AT THE AUSTIN. I THINK MEDICAL BOARD ISSUES WITH- WITH THE POST GRADUATE TRAINING LICENSE WITH MORE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REQUIRED THIRTY SIX MONTHS OF. RESIDENCY IS THE OUT OF STATE LICENSE HE'S COVERED AND FOR THEIR- FOR THEIR FELLOWSHIP IN NEEDING TO HAVE THEIR LICENSE. TYPICALLY ON JULY FIRST WHICH IS ALMOST. A DAY OR TWO AFTER THEY GET THEIR THIRTY SIX MONTHS IN IT AND BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY OBTAIN. THEIR UNRESTRICTED LICENSE AT THAT TIME. SO IT'S KINDA YOU SHOULD BE SEEN BUT LIKE I SAID EARLIER WE UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES THAT THIS HAS CREATED BUT- WE ALSO UNDERSTAND ANNE'S ANY CHANGE THE LAW MAY UNDERMINE CONSUMER PROTECTION. WELL I ASSUME THAT THE ISSUE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE DEOS FACE. RESIDENTS FACE- ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS POST GRADUATE TRAINING LICENSE THEY'RE THE SAME TYPE OF ISSUES THAT THOSE SUBJECT TO THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA- WILL FACE ARE YOU IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD WITH RESPECT TO ANY POTENTIAL. FIXES THAT ARE UNDER DISCUSSION BECAUSE CERTAINLY WE- IF WE EXPLORE AFFECTS- AND APPLIED TO BOTH WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKS FOR BOTH. AND WE'VE HAD SOME COMMUNICATION WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD- BUT LIKE I MENTIONED WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED TOO MANY COMPLAINTS WAS NOT AN AVENUE LEAVES- FULLY WENT DOWN AT THIS POINT BUT WE WILL BE IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD. MOVING FORWARD. WELL ONE MORE QUESTION ON A DIFFERENT SUBJECT TO CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION I NOTICED THAT THERE'S SOME. A DISCUSSION IF NOT PROPOSAL TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CME HOURS APPLICABLE TO THOSE SUBJECT TO. REGULATION AND CONTROL BY YOUR BOARD COULD YOU SORT OF EXPLAIN THE RATIONALE FOR THAT AND- HOW OF HOW THE PROCESS IS MOVING ALONG. BY MARK ELLIS YOU TO TEST SAY SOMETHING AND I MAYES CHIME IN AFTERWARDS. YEAH THE RATIONALE FOR THEIR REQUEST FOR THE SEAMY REDUCTION- SO IT. THE ONE HUNDRED HOURS EVERY TWO YEARS AT THE BOARD REQUIRES CURRENTLY- KIND OF CREATES A BURDEN FOR LICENSEES THAT HAVE SPECIALTIES AND SUBSPECIALTIES BECAUSE THOSE THOSE SPECIALTIES AND SUBSPECIALTIES THIS PACIFIC C. MEANS THAT THEY NEED TO. COMPLETE FOR THE SPECIALTIES- SO IT KIND OF CRAZY BURDEN FOR THOSE LICENSEES AND IT AN ADDITIONALLY ONE ALIGN RCB'S WITH THE MDC WHO ALSO HAVE THE SPECIALTIES. IN TRYING TO MAKE IT INEQUITABLE SITUATION. MISTER CHAIRMAN MAY ALSO ADD SOMETHING THAT- I AGREE WITH WHAT MARK SAID THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC BROUGHT TO LIGHT SOME OF THE BURDENS PLACED ON THE LICENSEES REGARDING CME REGULATIONS- WE HAVE CURRENTLY DOUBLE THE CME REQUIRED BY THE INDY COLLEAGUES AND THAT- WITH THIS PANDEMIC PROVIDED I JUST PRESSED TO SEEK INPUT GET INFORMATION FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT PROPOSED REDUCTION DOES NOT HURT THE OVERALL PARAMOUNT. MISSION OF THE BOARD WHICH I PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC ALL OF THE CREDENTIALING BODIES FROM THE HOSPITALS WE WORK AT FOR TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND PROVIDERS THAT WE HAVE TO BE CERTIFIED BY. HAVE THEIR OWN CME REQUIREMENTS ADDITIONALLY TO ENSURE THAT PHYSICIANS ARE KEEPING. WITH THE KNOWLEDGE. OF THE MOST CURRENT. EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE IN MEDICINE. WELL IT SORT OF MAKES SENSE TO ME OF IF IT'S WHAT THE BUT THE CME REQUIRED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA THAT YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. ONE THING THAT WAS NOT CLEAR TO ME FROM THE BACKGROUND PAPER AND DOCTOR PERHAPS YOU CAN- COVER THIS FROM YOUR OWN PERSPECTIVE AS AN INTERVENTIONIST GIG INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGISTS IN TERMS OF THE SPECIALTIES WHAT TYPE OF CME HOURS ARE REQUIRED AND I UNDERSTAND IT PROBABLY VARIES FROM SPECIALTY TO SPECIALTY BUT IN YOUR OWN CASE FOR EXAMPLE- IT THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION THANK YOU MR CHAIR SO. FOR ME AS AN INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGISTS I HAVE TO MAINTAIN AND A GENERAL CARDIOLOGISTS I MAINTAIN CERTIFICATION AND- ECHO CARTOGRAPHY RADIOLOGY- ALL OF WHICH REQUIRE SPECIFIC CME IS- TO CONTINUE THAT CERTIFICATION ALSO. AN ADULT CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY. THOSE THOSE CMA'S THAT ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN THAT CERTIFICATION ARE NOT NECESSARILY SEPARATE THAN THE CURRENT REQUIREMENT DURING CORPORATION TO THE CURRENT REQUIREMENT BUT INTENTIONALLY OSTEOPATHS- MAINTAIN. A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CMES THAT THEY HAVE TO GET EVERY YEAR THAT ARE APPROVED BY THE AMERICAN OSTEOPATHIC ASSOCIATION AS WELL SO. WITH THE CURRENT LEVEL OF CME REQUIREMENTS IT'S QUITE A BIT OF- OF EDUCATION IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE DO ON A DAILY BASIS WHICH IS LEARN NEW THINGS AND SORT OF ADAPT TO THE WAY EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES BUT THERE ARE MULTIPLE MULTIPLE- SEPARATE SETS. OF CME'S IN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF EDUCATION WITHIN OUR SPECIALTIES AND SUBSPECIALTIES THAT WERE REQUIRED TO GET EVERY EVERY SO OFTEN IN ADDITION TO THIS. THANK THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE OF COLLEAGUES ON THE FURNACE THE CENTER ARCHULETA. I'D LIKE TO ASK THE PRESIDENT- FIRST OFF I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU AND CONGRATULATE EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU IN THE MEDICAL FIELD FOR BEING THERE FOR US ALL IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND ALL OF US OF- IT KNOWLEDGE THE FIRST RESPONDERS IN THE COURTS TO DOCTORS AND NURSES WE THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND INTENSIVE TRAINING THAT YOU CONTINUE TO RECEIVE BUT I WOULD LIKE TO JUST- POINT OUT I'M I'M IMPRESSED WITH YOUR MISSION STATEMENT. WHICH IS SHORT SWEET IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR READY PROJECT THE PUBLIC BY REQUIRING COMPETENCY ACCOUNTABILITY INTEGRITYIN THE SAFE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE AND- IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT YOU HAD AN INCREASED BY THIRTY THREE PERCENT- EARLY IN YOUR STATEMENT. WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THAT TO. AMANDA PASSING SO- SOME OF THIS QUESTION TO MARK I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOULD BE TO THERE ARE LOTS. MORE OUT OF STATE LICENSING. SEEKING WHAT. AND CAL- MAYBE PERHAPS BECAUSE UPPER- IN THE CARE FOR. IT IS MORE RIGHT THAN THE STATE ADDITIONALLY WITH THE PANDEMIC. MORE PEOPLE AND- SOUGHT LICENSURE. GRADUATES FROM OTHER MEDICAL SCHOOLS- ARE COMING HERE. MAYBE MARKY CAN ALSO ADD SOMETHING. I THINK THE GROWING POPULATION I THINK- DR HARI CAN HIT ON THE HEAD WITHOUT WITHOUT A STATE LICENSE HE'S COMING IN BUT IT ISN'T THAT. I THINK IS THE POPULARITY OF THE OSTEOPATHIC PROFESSION PROFESSION IS GROWING THERE'S A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO MEDICINE AND I THINK IT'S- IS GAINING POPULARITY AS A WHOLE. YOU FOR THE YEAR JOB YOU'VE DONE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- IN THE MEDICAL FIELD. THANK YOU MR. ALEX ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THOSE ON THE SENATE FLOOR. SEEING NONE I SEE NONE FROM THOSE MEMBERS PARTICIPATING REMOTELY GERMAN I THINK YOU CAN CONSIDER IT TO BE A TESTAMENT TO GOOD WORK THAT WERE NOT LINED UP ASKING YOU A SERIES OF.

THESE CLINICS WILL BRING I CARE CALIFORNIANS WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD IT AND LITTLE PROFESSIONAL SERVICE DESK.

ON A SEPARATE MATTER WE ARE ENGAGING THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE AND STAKEHOLDER GROUPS TO IMPROVE THE ENFORCEABILITY OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALEJO'S ASSEMBLY BILL SIX EIGHTY FOUR AND ACT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN.

OF THE GREAT WORK OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOCHER LOW WITH THE BOARD OF OPTOMETRY- IN MY DISTRICT WE HAD A NONPROFIT THAT TAKE THEIR MOBILE- I CLINICS. TO A MIDDLE SCHOOL. AND A FEW WEEKS LATER THEY CAME BACK AND I ACCOMPANIED THEM ON THE RETURN. BECAUSE AFTER THEY TESTED THE KIDS FOR FREE. THEY CAME BACK WITH- I- I GLASSES. AND STARTED. CALLING THE CLASSES OUT. THEY WERE ABLE TO PUT A- A PAIR OF GLASSES ON TO THIS LITTLE GIRL. AND I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MOVING IT WAS WHEN THE FIRST WORDS OUT OF HER MOUTH WAS I CAN SEE.

YEAR OR THE YEAR BEFORE TIME FLIES- BUT IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU AND SILICON VALLEY AT YOUR BOARD MEETING AS WE DISCUSSED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ISSUES SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR SERVICE AND BEING SO ACCESSIBLE THE FIRST QUESTION IS WITH RESPECT EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AS YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF DISCUSSIONS WITH RESPECT TO- TELEHEALTH AND SPECIFICALLY THAT OFCONSUMER PROTECTION MAKING SURE THAT WE UTILIZE THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT EXIST BUT ALSO PROTECTING ACCESS TO CARE. AND ALSO THAT TO THE HARM OF PATIENTS SPECIFICALLY IN THIS AREA OF TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS THAT ALLOW FOR PATIENTS TO RECEIVE UPDATED PRESCRIPTIONS FOR CONTACTS OR GLASSES WITHOUT HAVING TO VISIT A LICENSEE AND THOMAS TRYST DO WE KNOW OF ANY POTENTIAL RISKS ARE HARM. TO CONSUMERS SPECIFICALLY WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY. LET ME START TO TRY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AND THEN SHURIKEN- HOUSE MORE OF A GROUND LEVEL OF PERSPECTIVE- COURSE. IT IS THE MISSION OF THE BOARD- PROTECT CONSUMERS THINK AND INSTEAD OF THE CARE CENTER OF KERRY IS THE BOTTOM LINE. WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME NOW WE HAD MEETINGS. IN 201-929-2020 WE HAD A TELEMEDICINE WORKGROUP ACTIVE- AND OUR WORKGROUP CONCLUSIONS ARE THAT I IN ANY FOR DISCIPLINE STAKEHOLDERS AND CONCLUSIONS ARE THAT. OPTOMETRY IS GENERALLY NOT A FIELD THAT LANDS THE TELEMEDICINE- BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF ONLINE RETAILERS- DOING THE REFRACTIONS ETCETERA- BASED ON- BASED ON APPS- WHEN THIS FIRST HIT OR SCREENS. I REMEMBER HEARING. COMMENTS BY OPTOMETRISTS ASKING US TO. MAKE THIS ILLEGAL- OUTRIGHT- OUR IMMEDIATE ANSWERS USUALLY IT'S- THE OPHTHALMOLOGIST THAT THESE. PRESCRIPTIONS OR THESE EXAMINATION GO DROPPED OPHTHALMOLOGIST. AND SO WE HAD NO JURISDICTION BUT IT IS A GROWING MATTER- THE WORKGROUP HAS TOLD US THAT- THAT ONLINE REFRACTIONS- RECENTLY ACCURATE CORRECTIVE LENS PRESCRIPTION. BUT. CANNOT ACCESS THE- HEALTH OF THE ICE PHOCION THE PATIENTS I. A OR TREAT DISEASE- PROVIDE CONSULTATION ON PATIENTS THIS HEALTH SO- WHAT WE'RE WE'RE CONTINUING TO STUDY IT IT- IT IS A IT IS A CONSIDERABLE- IT IS A DIFFICULT PROBLEM PROBLEM FOR US TO CHECK DROPPED. TO DRAW THE LINE THE RIGHT LINE SURE SURE CAN YOU ADD TO THIS. ABSOLUTELY NOT THANK YOU CHIRLA FOR THE AT THE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THAT OBVIOUSLY WE- OF COURSE GOVERNMENT CODE PROHIBITS ME FROM- SPEAKING TO TRIGGER THE COMPLAINT. BUT A COURSE- EIGHT ENDED YOU CAN LOOK RIDICULOUS TWENTY CATEGORY THAT WE TRACK- THERE IS SOME IMPORTANT ACTIVITY AROUND HOUSTON BUT YOU INCLUDED SERVICE MODEL- BUT AGAIN I DON'T. KNOW THE SPECIFICS OF THE SHARE THE SPECIFICS ABOUT THE CAN'T HIT THERE HAS BEEN PARTICULAR HARM- AND AGAIN AS OPPOSITE. WARNED ONLY MENTIONED. I FOR A LONG THE- SERVICE WILL BE MODELED USE MY I OPHTHALMOLOGY- VERIFYING THOSE A BIG PUSH FOR- SO WE'RE ONLY JUST TO SEE THAT. IN OPTOMETRY AND WITH THE LEDGER OF. THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AS YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE IN THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPREHENSIVE EYE EXAMS I COME FROM A FAMILY OF TOM INTEREST. LAST YEAR WE WERE TO BUILD SPECIFICALLY IN THAT TO HELP EXPAND THROUGH A MOBILE OFFICES AS AS IMMIGRATION ALSO-REFERENCED. AND I STILL THINK IT'S A YET TO BE DETERMINED AND NOT YET CONVINCED THAT RESTRICTING THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES DO CAN- DO HAVE DIRECT PATIENT HARM. AS WITH THE CASE OF COURSE FOR US TO ACT SWIFTLY IN THE AREA OF THE ORTHODONTIST SPACE FOR EXAMPLE- BUT WE SHOULD LOOK FOR POLICIES THAT HELP ADDRESS MANY OF THESE DIFFERENT ISSUES IN TERMS OF. EMERGING TECHNOLOGY SO I KNOW THAT YOU'LL BE ON THE FOREFRONT OF THAT TO HELP ENSURE THAT WE SUPPORT TECHNOLOGIESAND ALSO CONSUMER PROTECTION AT THE SAME TIME. THAT TRANSITIONING TO ITEM NUMBER TWO- BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN THE BOARD BEGAN DRAFTING LEGISLATION TO IMPOSE NEW REGULATIONS ON OPTICIANS AND OPTICAL COMPANIES IN OUR STATE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE THIRTY OR SO STATES THAT HAVE NO REGULATION IN. THE OPTICAL SPACE BECAUSE OF THE JOBS THEY PERFORM YEAH AND OR WHETHER NOT THE PERSON SPECIFIC RISK- INTO THE QUESTION IS HOW DOES THE BOARD TO KNOW OF ANY SPECIFIC RISK OF HARM TO. CONSUMER PROTECTION THAT MAY JUSTIFY. THE REGULATION IN THE SPACE. SO YOU KNOW THE V. THE OPTICIANS DO INTERACT WITH WITH PATIENTS AND- THE PROBLEM ARISES MOSTLY FROM FROM. ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE- AND COSTLY FOR TO IS WHEN OUR OXYGEN CROSSES THE LINE AND STARTS TO GO OUTSIDE THEIR LANE AND TRIES TO BE EIGHT OPTOMETRIST OR OPHTHALMOLOGIST AND DIAGNOSING OR GIVING HEALTH CARE ADVICE RATHER THAN DOING THAT FITTING- I THINK THE- THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR IS REALLY ADVANCED- CONSUMER PROTECTION- RUBY GARCIA WHO IS A FORMER MEMBER WHO WAS A MEMBER OF OUR BOARD- WORKED VERY HARD TO- COULD PROFESSIONAL ICE. THE OPTICIAN PROFESSION TO OUR BOARD WE'VE ENACTED DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES THAT WOULD- RAISE THE STANDARD OF ETHICS AND- AND PRACTICE- AND WE'VE CONDUCTED ENFORCEMENT- THAT. PRIOR WHEN THE OPTICIANS WERE UNDER THE MEDICAL BOARD I THINK- ENFORCEMENT AND- ENFORCEMENT AND REGULATION OF THE OPPOSITION'S WORSE ON A ON A ANY- A LOWER PRIORITY SO I THINK WE HAVE A CHANCE THE- THE CONSUMER PROTECTION- SHERIFF. THANK YOU FOR AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FOR THE ORGANIC ON A IT IS IMPORTANT RIGHT THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE CARD DATA WHAT WE HAVE R. B. CONFUSE CONSUMERS THE LITTLE- COME BACK AND SAY MY OPTOMETRIST GOT MINE MY PRESCRIPTION WRONG WHEN IN FACT IT- KNOWLEDGEABLE OXYGEN HAS FILLED THAT PRESCRIPTION IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN A WAY THAT WOULD- GET OF WORK FOR THE PATIENT AND ALWAYS REMEMBER ONE OF THE STORIES TOLD TO ME BY- TO CHALLENGE THE FORMER BOARD MEMBER OF OURS- AND SHE WAS PART OF A LARGER PRACTICE AND- THERE WERE. OPPOSITION BUT PEOPLE CAN DO WE OPPOSITION TO WORK RIGHT- RETAIL WORKERS REALLY AND TRULY WERE THERE TO HELP LAST WEEK- BUT WE'RE DOING OPPOSITION LIKE STAYING AND SO WHEN THEY SIT. ADULT CLASSES. THEY THEY WOULD PUT THAT MEET UP. CUSTOMER'S IP OUT OF THE WORLD AND THEN THERE WERE ACTUALLY A AN INSTANCE WHERE. A PATIENT CALL THE- AND SAID- I'M HAVE A LOT OF AND- REALLY NOT. WHEN WEARING GLASSES- AND THE DOCTOR SAID WHAT YEAH COME ON BACK IN YOU KNOW WHAT WON'T WILL HAVE YOU KNOW THE ON. THE TAKE A LOOK AT IT SPOKE I'M ACTUALLY IN THE PARKING LOT. AND I'VE BEEN TOLD TWICE NOW. THAT I JUST NEED TO GET USED TO IT- UNTIL. ALWAYS BEEN MY ME THAT. IT A CLEAR CUT WAY US TO LOOK AT IT GET THE DATA ON THE ISSUE BUT I THINK THAT WHEN IT GOES BAD WE KNOW THAT OFFICE IS NOT TO BE TRADE BETTER SKILLS ARE NEEDED WITHIN THE VISION HERE SPACE- AND THAT YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE REGULATED LEGISLATIVE OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE THEY'RE TRYING TO FIRE BY CALIFORNIA'S LEGISLATURE TO REGULATE THE PRACTICE. BUT ALSO THEN TO FURTHER LOOK AT SANDERS- DIVERSION SILICATE CANTER- YOU KNOW BUT OVERSEEING RETAIL WORKERS TO LOOK AT- YOU KNOW EDUCATION AND EDUCATION ALL OF THAT I THINK THAT WE WANT TO SEE IT WE KNOW THAT IT NEEDS TO BE THERE AND IT NEEDS TO BE. PROVIDED WITH SKILLED LABOR BECAUSE IT IS TOUGH TO GET OUTSIDE OF ANECDOTAL BUT WE HAVE SPENT TWENTY NINETEEN WITH OUR PROFESSIONAL- FROM THE OPPOSITION ON THE DIFFERENT THE OPTICIAN COMMITTEE REALLY GOING THROUGH THEIR EXPERIENCE- AND THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF SUPERVISING THOSE WHO ARE RETAIL WORKERS AS OPPOSED TO OPPOSITION I'M NOT A PERFECT EXCELLENT REPORT IS A CONTACT CENTER. I MEAN IT REALLY FOUND THAT YOU KNOW THERE THERE IS A NEED FOR THE KILL LEVEL- I'M NOT TOO SURE TO BE ON THE FLOOR AND COULD BE A PART OF THE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE HOW THE DOCTOR ARE SET. AND ADAPTED FOR A CONSUMERS. BUT WHILE I MAKE TO THE TO THE- COMMITTEES. WE NOT WANT TO OVER. IN THIS ERA. ONE BE VERY. MANY THE AT THE- FIELD IS. A AND ENTRY JOB IN THE AYE HEALTH INDUSTRY. HELLO OF PEOPLE ONLY HIGH HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION- THEY DON'T GET PAID VERY MUCH. SOME OF THE MORE INSPIRING STORIES I'VE HEARD MY WORK ARE. PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERVED TIME IN PRISON AND LEARN TO BE OPTICIANS IN PRISON. AND NOW WANT TO HAVE A NEW TART IN THEIR LIVES AND WANT TO BECOME LICENSED OPTICIANS- OF COURSE WE HAVE TO REVIEW THEIR- THEIR- APPLICATIONS BECAUSE OF THE THERE ARE SERIOUS CRIMES THAT THEY'VE COMMITTED. BUT THAT THERE THERE THE DIGITAL FIRING SPARRING STORIES ABOUT HOW THEY WANTED TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THEIR PAST WHETHER IN THEIR YOUTH OR- YOUNG DECADES BEFORE. AND SO WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THESE PEOPLE TO BECOME OPTICIANS AND NOT OVER REGULATING AREA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR BOARD PRESIDENT APPRECIATE HEARING DIRECTLY THAT STATEMENT ABOUT NOT WHAT DID THE DESIRE NOT TO OVER REGULATE BUT ALSO. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A PULSE ON WHAT'S GOING ON. WITH RESPECT TO CONSUMER PROTECTION SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT AND FINALLY THE QUESTION ON FOR MADE. IT IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER- YOU PROVIDED A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THAT WAS US OF CONCERN. ON THE CLARIFICATION ON ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. WAS VERY TROUBLED TO READ IN THE BOARD SUNSET REPORT ABOUT A IN MAJOR OPTICAL RETAILER REFUSING TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. NAKORN REPORTED IT APPEARS THAT THERE'S A COMPANY. THAT TO WHICH THE BOARD HAS ISSUED A TOTAL OF TWENTY ONE CITATIONS. AND YET. THIS COMPANY HAS REFUSED TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE IS THAT ACCURATE. SINCE THIS IS A FORCE THAT LATER I'LL TURN THIS OVER TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE. YES SIR LOW THAT IS ACCURATE WE HAVE- CITED LOCATION TWENTY ONE TIME- AND WE ARE STILL NOT ABLE TO GET THAT LARGE RETAILER INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. THE UAE REPORT IT'S AT THE FOR THE FINES ARE AN AMOUNT OF FOR THE TOTAL OF ALL OF THE CITATIONS. IN TOTALITY IS SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS- IT HAS THE BOARD BEEN ABLE TO COLLECT ON IN THOSE CITATIONS. NO WE HAVE NOT HEARD. AND TO DATE THE BOARD HAS SPENT ALMOST A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS ON INVESTIGATIONS AND LEGAL DEFENSE OF THE CITATIONS IS THAT CORRECT AS IT IS WITH THE SITTING REPORT. THAT IS CORRECT SIR. SO WE WILL- TO THE ROAD TO BOARD EXACT OF OUR FOR OFFICER WHAT WHAT'S WRONG HERE WHAT TOOL DO YOU THINK IS MISSING FROM- FOR US TO GET COMPLIANCE BECAUSE IT JUST APPEARS THAT THERE'S A BIG MIDDLE FINGER THAT'S BEING. SENT TO US AND IT IS POP BERMAN TROUBLING THAT YOU'RE NOT EMPOWER TO HELP ENFORCE THE LAW AT HAND SO WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO HELP EMPOWER YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL ON THE ISSUE OF ENFORCEMENT. OKAY THEN- THE OUR REPORT WE HAVE ENGAGED THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN THE STATE- UNFORTUNATELY I DO NOT HAVE. LANGUAGE THAT I CAN GET YOU RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE STILL WORKING THROUGH THAT- BUT- IT REALLY ISN'T STRENGTHENING IN THE TAXIS THAT THERE. MUST NOT BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE. OF THE OPTICAL COMPANY. OVER THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS SCHEDULING APPOINTMENTS- THE APPEARANCE THAT. THAT- I POLITICS. THAT THE OPTICAL AT PROVIDING- OPTOMETRIST WHEN IN FACT THEY DO NOT AND CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT BE I'M INVOLVED IN THE INDEPENDENT WORK OF AN OPTOMETRIST UNITY COLOCATED WITH THEM- WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE I AM PLEASED TO CREATE A- AWAY ON THE LINE IT WAS HAD IT HERE THE- FRONT OF. I WOULD THINK ABOUT IT- BUT WE HAVE THE ENGAGE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN OTHER STAKEHOLDERS- DESIGNATED THE CURRENTLY IN THE APPEAL PROCESS- AND SO WE ARE GAINING MORE KNOWLEDGE EVERY DAY- ON HOW WE CAN STRENGTHEN- FIVE FIVE. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS ARE GIVEN THE WRONG IMPRESSION ABOUT THE PROVIDING THE SERVICES. AND OUR- BEING PUSHED BY LOCKING THE POSTER AS OPPOSED. TO GETTING COMPREHENSIVE I. AND SO AS AS AS WE ARE THIS. IN THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING THE BOARD IS SICK LEAD TO. CLEAR FOR. AND THORNY TO ENSURE THAT YOU. HAVE THE- THE ISSUES. TO BE ABLE TO- BUT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE I SHOULD SAY. YES WE ARE HERE AND WE HOPE THAT WE CAN ON COMPUTERS WITH STAFF AND THEN BRING THAT INFORMATION TO MEMBERS BEFORE ARE BUILT ON A PATH. WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY CURRENTLY ON GETTING THAT LANGUAGE TOGETHER FOR YOU I'M AND I THINK THAT A- LOT OF HAVE BEEN WALKING BY DOCTOR HOW THE CONVERSATION. AND WE WILL CERTAINLY BRING THAT LANGUAGE ABOUT ANOTHER COURSE- WANT. TO DETECT THAT WITH. NUMBERS THANK YOU I JUST OF. READING YOUR YOUR REPORT IN FISCAL YEAR. EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN. AND TWO BUDGET YEARS THE BOARD REQUESTED EMERGENCY BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS TO CONTINUE THE LEGAL DEFENSE. SO THREE YEARS IN THE MAKING. I'M READING-COURAGE YOU TO BRING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION RATHER THAN WAIT FOR AN OVERSIGHT HEARING FOR US TO TACKLE THAT ISSUE. SHOULD THERE BE ISSUES IN WITH A HAND AND I OFTENTIMES KNOW THAT THINGS TAKE TIME BUT- WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE SUPPORT GOOD ACTORS. AND DOES THAT- COMPLETELY ARE BLATANT IN THEIR APPROACH TO NOT IN COMPLYING WITH THE LAW WE WANT TO BE SURE TO TACKLE THAT ACCORDINGLY. THANK YOU SIR WE APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THAT OPENED UP AND I CERTAINLY WILL WILL COME TO YOU ON IRRESPONSIBLE IN THERE IF THERE IS. THE SORT OF EREGIOUS BREACH THAT INTEGRATING AT A DISADVANTAGE. YES WE WANT TO SET YOU UP FOR SUCCESS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES THANK YOU BYE STATURE. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHIRLA JUST A COUPLE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS THEN ON THE QUESTIONS POSED BY MY- COLLEAGUE THE CHAIR- IN THE AREA OF TELEHEALTH IF THE- APPLICATION OF TELEHEALTH FOR RICK REFRACTIVE SERVICES CONTINUES. I'M JUST CURIOUS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE BOARD WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE INTERVAL THEN. FOR COMPREHENSIVE EYE EXAMS. IS IT ONE YEAR IS IT TWO YEARS. THREE YEARS IS THERE ANY AGREEMENT ON WHAT SUCH AN INTERVAL WOULD LOOK LIKE. AS OUR CARD WE DISCUSSED EARLIER WE AREN'T PUT TOGETHER TO LOOK HELLA HELLA HELP WORKING GROUP THAT HAD BEEN- DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES AND BRINGING IT RESEARCH FROM OTHER STATES I WE HAVE NOT COME DOWN WITH IT AND IT IS. INTERNAL BUT I THINK THE OLD PEOPLE LOOKING AT ABOUT TWO TO THREE YEARS UNLESS OF COURSE THERE IS A MAGNIFIED NOT MEDICAL ISSUE THAT REQUIRES MORE FREQUENT CHECKING OF ONE PRESCRIPTION BECAUSE AGAIN THAT IS. BEST CELEBRATED THE BORDER FROM DOWN TO BUT AS WE HAVE OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR TELEHEALTH HEALTH WORKGROUP- WE ARE SEEING THAT INTERVAL B. USED IN OTHER PLACES BECAUSE I ASSUME REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE'RE HAVING A TELEHEALTH CONVERSATION OR A COVER CONVERSATION ABOUT. I HEALTH IN GENERAL THERE MUST BE SOME GENERAL AGREEMENT. IN THE PROFESSION AS TO HOW OFTEN- SOMEONE SHE AT. GO IN FOR A COVERING AG SO I UNDERSTAND. THAT YOU'RE SO IT'S TWO TO THREE YEARS IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US AS WE- WORK THROUGH THAT ISSUE- HERE AS WELL SO KEEP US POSTED ON THE RESULTS OF THAT COMMITTEE IF YOU WILL. AND THEN ON THE ISSUES RAISED BY CHAIR LOW HAVING TO DO WITH THE ENFORCEMENT. WITH RESPECT TO THE OUT OF STATE- OPTICAL COMPANY. YOU KNOW IT SEEMS TO ME IFTHE LAW IS CLEAR AND CONSTITUTIONAL. IS THERE NOT SOME INJUNCTIVE RELIEF SOME SHUT DOWN. ORDER AUTHORITY THAT CAN BE PURSUED FOR. OUT OF STATE COMPANIES WHO DEFY. WHAT WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN THE LEGISLATURE AND WHAT THE GOVERNOR DOES WITH WITH RESPECT TO PUTTING LAWS ON THE BOOKS. IS THAT BEING PURSUED WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. YES SO- WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK THE CITATIONS THEY ARE BEING HEARD- BY THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS- WE ARE WORKING WITH A TEAM YOUR DAD IN ORDER TO- CONTINUE TO PURSUE THE CASE- WE ARE IN THE APPEAL PROCESS AT THIS. JUNCTURE. HIWITHOUT BEING ABOUT WITHOUT BEING A LAWYER NOT TO JUMP IN A MORE THAN HER FOR WEARING THE ARE- BUT WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING TO ADDRESS THAT MORE IMMEDIATELY- AND HE'S GONE THROUGH THE HEARING PROCESS- BUT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO. MEET IN THAT DOWN- BUT WE ARE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE- THE YOU KNOW OUR OUR OUR- ATTORNEY GENERAL. LIAISON IS- ARE ASSIGNED TO DEDICATE- HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH A QUITE DILIGENTLY I'M QUITE CLOSELY ACTIVELY INTERACTION IN A MEETING EARLIER THIS MORNING AT NINE FIFTEEN WITH OUR DEPARTMENT. WE ARE- PURSUING ALL LEGAL AVENUES AND WOULD YOU BRING THAT. OUR COMPANY INTO COMPLIANCE. WELL I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS IS CERTAINLY. THE PURVIEW OF THESE CAN BE BUT- IT JUST OCCURS TO ME THAT THIS IS PROBABLY A SOMEWHAT UNIQUE SITUATION AND IF A- LARGE OUT OF STATE COMPANY IS. THROWING DOWN THE GAUNTLET IN CHALLENGING WHAT WE DO HERE- QUEUING UP OUR RESOURCES TRYING TO PROSECUTE AND DEFEND CITATIONS WHEN IN FACT THE CHALLENGES A MUCH LARGER WHEN. PERHAPS EVERYBODY CAN AGREE INCLUDING THE OUT OF STATE COMPANY THAT THEY WANT TO CHALLENGE THE RULES SO. MAYBE WE OUGHT TO GET IT INTO A FORUM WHERE WE'RE JUST CHALLENGING THE RULE AND- LINE UP THE TROOPS AND- MAY THE BEST PERSON WIN BUT I'LL LEAVE THAT TO YOU AND TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO FIGURE OUT AND THE BEST OF LUCK TO YOU. WE'RE ON YOUR SIDE. A FEW PROCESS QUESTIONS BEFORE I TURN IT BACK TO MY- COLLEAGUES IN THE CHAMBER AND THOSE REMOTELY- IN LOOKING THROUGH THE BACKGROUND MATERIAL. I KNOW THAT- THIS BOARD HAS DONE AN ABSOLUTELY SUPERB JOB IN MANAGING YOUR FISCAL RESOURCES AND- MUNSON RESERVE OF FUNDING IF INCREASED FROM TWELVE POINT ONE. BACK IN THE FY. TWO SEVEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY SIX AND A HALF MONTHS. RIGHT NOW BUT THE BACKGROUND PAPER. NOTES THAT THE BOARD IS PROJECTING A DEFICIT IN FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE- HOW AND WHY. THERE ARE A NUMBER- ARE ACTORS HERE- WE ARE SO VERY THANKFUL TO SHARE LOW- FOR INCLUDING AN ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT NINE CORRECT THE MERGER OF OUR TWO FUNDS TO THE ACCOUNTS REPORT OF COURSE WE TALK ABOUT OVERSEAS OPTICIAN THREE AN OPTOMETRY AND THAT'S HAVE BEEN SEPARATE- FOR INSTANTLY FIFTEEN WE WERE GIVEN THE AUTHORITY FOR MEDICAL BOARD TO OVERSEE OF THE PROFESSION. BOB WE- ARE NOW LOOKING AT PROJECTIONS IN BUDGET DOCUMENTS THAT INCLUDE THE MERGER OF THE FUND- AND SO WE ARE ON A STABLE FOOTING WE HAVE A LARGER PROJECTION OF ONE CONVERTER- OF COURSE YOU KNOW YOU COULD CONFIRM THAT THE COMING TOGETHER TO PROGRAMS- INTO- OUR SONS GATHERED- UNDERCOVER STING BY THE PROGRAMS THAT WE WILL BE DOING A SHERIFF COSTS- SURVEY TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE- ARE SUPPORTING ADMINISTRATIVE AND YOU KNOW A LOT. ENFORCEMENT MIGHT BE GREAT- FROM BOTH LIKE TO STREAM AT THAT I JUST WANT TO SAY TO THAT IS THAT IS SUCH A HUGE- BILLION FOR IRAQ ADMINISTRATIVELY- EIGHTY EIGHT NINETY SIX BECAUSE WE HAVE AT THIS POINT ONE ANALYST IN OUR DEPARTMENT UNIT WHO- IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THE OPPOSITION PAPERS AND YOU'LL SEE THAT- IN OUR LICENSING NUMBERS ARE NUMBERS OF LICENSES FOR OPTOMETRISTS OPTICIANS IS ACTUALLY PRETTY CLOSE TO THE SAME- AND SO WE THOUGHT ONE ANALYST TO OVERSEE THE WHOLE PROGRAM YOU HAVE A CASELOAD THAT TWICE THAT. OF THE OTHER ANALYSTS WHO WERE WORKING OUT TIME FOR CASES THAT WE'RE STILL VERY THANKFUL TO CHAIR LOW FOR- GIVING US THE FLEXIBILITY TO FIND TO MERGE THE FUNDS WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO SEARCH OUR WORKFORCE TO BE- IT MOST NEEDED AREAS ON AS OPPOSED TO BEING STOPPED BY THIS PROGRAM CONSTRAINTS. SO WE'RE WE'RE UNDERNEATH WHILE WE'RE ON. I PROBABLY OUGHT TO GO TO ONE OF YOUR MEMBERS AND YOUR GLASSES DON'T WORK SO WELL I WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE OPTICIAN FUND CONDITION AND NOT THE OPTOMETRY FUND CONDITION IN AT FOUR POINT TWO MONTHS IN RESERVE YOU ARE IN FACT- IF NOT BORDERING ON. A PROBLEM EXPERIENCING A PROBLEM THAT WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND- I APOLOGIZE FOR MAKING YOU MAKE THEM. LET ME TURN TO- CONTINUING EDUCATION AT THIS POINT- THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE% THAT IS UNIQUE TO YOU FOR ALL APPARENTLY IN THE HEALTHCARE AREA. YOU- I ASSUME REQUIRE YOUR MEMBERS TO SELF CERTIFY RIGHT WITH RESPECT TO COMPLETION OF- CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS. YES WE DID THAT STATION AT THE TIME OF RENEWAL SO I WAS I WAS TAKEN BY THE COMMENTS IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER IF I HAVEN'T MISSED READ THESE. THAT THERE WAS AN AUDIT AND THERE WAS A FAILURE RATE OF APPARENTLY OF THOSE AUDITED. FAILED TO COMPLETE THEIR SEALY REQUIREMENTS. AND I ASSUME THAT'S AFTER OF SELF CERTIFICATION. DID I READ THAT THIS ONE CORRECTLY. YES YES THEY'RE ROBBING YOU CAN YOU READ THE BUDGET NUMBERS OF RECKLESS AS WELL BUT NOW WE'VE GOT A COMBINED FORTY BUT THE OFFICE YOU KNOW SH I'M YEAH WE AT. FELT AT. AND WE ARE AND TRIED ALL BETWEEN BY THE ABOUT THEIR ACT BUT THEY WILL GO BACK TO THAT AND SAY THANK FOR TRYING TO THEIR PLEASE GIVE A THE RECORD STILL THE YOU DID THAT I MEAN HAD A HIGH THAT PROBABLY 31% FAILURE RATE. I'M AND I'M GONNA GET LOT MORE AT THE BOARD FAVORITE BUT MIGHTY- WE NOT BEEN ABLE PRIORITY OUR C. E. AUDIT- WE- AN IMPORTANT. AND WE ARE CURRENTLY- GOING THE PROCESS TO HIRE RETIRED UNIT ACROSS TRAINING AND BRING ALL ITS TRANSFER. PROPELLANT ARE IMPORTANT BASS. SO WE'RE BRINGING IN MORE RESOURCES JULY ONE IF WE CAN'T- IN ORDER TO DEDICATE TRADEMARK VOTE. THAT WERE ABLE TO HAVE. MORE OF OUR ENFORCEMENT ANALYSTS WORKING ON THOSE ON IT SHOULD COME AS OPPOSED TO BEING. I LOVED WITH ONE PERSON AND WHEN THAT PERSON LEAVES- YOU KNOW I NEED TO BACKFILL THAT- KNOWLEDGE AND- YEAH OPERATION OF THE BOARD. SO WE REALIZED THAT IT IT. THE BILL RATE IS. GOING ON AT WORK MORE REACH THAN- YEAH COMPUTER PERFORMING THE IT. WELL ACTUALLY MIKE MICHAEL WAS NOT MEANT TO BE CRITICAL. OF MICRO ACTUALLY COMP. THE FACT THAT YOU'RE DOING AUDITS AND YOU DISCOVER THAT FOLKS. APPARENTLY CERTIFIED THAT THEY'VE COMPLETED THEIR SEALY OR NOT C. L. E. THAT'S ME. US CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS AND THEN THEY DON'T SO I THINK YOU'RE DOING A FINE JOB OBVIOUSLY MORE IS BETTER AND THANK YOU FOR TRYING TO WORK ON THAT. MY QUESTION GOES TO AND IT COMES FROM MY BACKGROUND BOTH AS A MILITARY GUY IN MY PAST. AND I ONCE WAS A LAWYER. AND CERTIFICATIONS- HAVE MEANING. TO MOST PEOPLE. AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE AN OPTOMETRIST TO CERTIFIES THAT THEY HAVE COMPLETED CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS AND THEN YOU AUDIT AND 31% OF THEM HAVING CERTIFIED THAT THEY'VE DONE THE JOB THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO YOU FIND THAT THEY HAVE NOT I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM AND I NOTICE IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER THEY'RE SUBJECT TO A CITATION OR FORMAL DISCIPLINE. I WOULD ASSUME THAT IF INTEGRITY BEING WHAT IT IS AND YOU WILL HAVE TO CHARGE CONDITIONS AND WE DEPEND ON HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS TO CHART ACCURATELY AND WHAT THEY PUT DOWN AS WHAT THEY SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE PEOPLE THE 31% OF THEM WHO. SAY THEY DID IT BUT DIDN'T DO IT. YEAH YOU KNOW WE USED TO LIKE MY MOTHER MY MOTHER USED TO SAY IF YOU KNOW OF THOSE WHO LIVE WILL CHEAT RIGHT. SO. SO WHAT WE FIND IN OUR AUDIT THAT THAT 31% FAILURE DOESN'T INCLUDE THOSE WHO. WISH I THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE ATTENDING A SESSION THAT WAS- EITHER WOULD WOULD COUNT TOWARD THIRTY THING EDUCATION BUT IN FACT IT HADN'T BEEN VERIFIED BY COKE- THE NATIONAL. OR BY THE BOARD ITSELF- AND SO THAT WAS YOU KNOW A MISTAKE ON THEIR PART WE ASK THEM TO GO BACK AND- CORRECT THAT GOING WE TAKE THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE DEALING BY ATTENDING ANOTHER- WORKSHOPS AND TO DO THAT WORK IN A CERTAIN TIME PERIOD USUALLY THIRTY TO SIXTY DAYS DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER- THE- PREDATOR MISTAKE- AND- THEN YOU KNOW. IT ALSO. BE SURE THAT THIS WILL BE A PART OF WHAT YOUR SHOULD BE DOING GOING FORWARD REMEMBER THIS IS OUR MEDIATION- WE TELL THEM UNTIL. WE ASK THAT THEY- QUICKLY FINISH THOSE- UNIT BUT THEY HAVE BEEN HADN'T THE BILL. ON EIGHT EIGHT ARE. THE INCLUDE RARITY THAT WE GET SOME WHO HAS JUST FALSE- BUT WE FIRST WORK IN THE IF YOU ACTION WE WORK TO GET THEM TO COME- ETHICALLY FORTY THAT THAT ISN'T- HAPPENING. WE HAVE COURSE ARE TO BE BACK TO. OUR PORTAL TO. IN ORDER GET THE EXACTLY IF YOU CAN HOLD PUBLIC TOWN AND I KNOW THE WE'VE GOT- PRACTITIONERS ARE WILLING TO CHEAT THEIR OWN THE AND POSSIBLY. WHEN THEY'RE DEALING THE FOR TAX OF THE PRINTER THAT IS VERY VERY HIGH AND ABSOLUTE CAN THAT OCCUR I COULD SEE HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN WHERE YOU THINK YOU'RE PICKING A COURSE THAT QUALIFIES. IT DOESN'T QUITE. OR YOU THINK YOU HAVE TWENTY FIVE HOURS BUT YOU ONLY HAVE TWENTY FOUR POINT FIVE. AND I'M PLEASED TO HEAR THAT YOU SAY THAT THE ONES THAT. CLEARLY YOU'RE TRYING TO GAME THE SYSTEM ARE VERY VERY FEW AND THAT'S A THAT'S COMFORTING SO THANK YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION. ON THE IN THE AREA OF- ENFORCEMENT AND COST RECOVERY OF THIS THIS QUESTION BEFORE AND IF IT'S NOT AN INTELLIGENT QUESTION IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT IT'S NOT AND YOU CAN LET ME KNOW. I HAVE THICK SKIN BUT- WE HAVE A CHART IN% OUR BACKGROUND PAPER THAT TALKS ABOUT POTENTIAL CASES FOR COST RECOVERY IN CASES. WHERE RECOVERY- WHAT RECOVERY WAS ORDERED. HELLO I'M TRYING AND THEN THE AMOUNT COLLECTED AND I'M TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR COST RECOVERY PROGRAM AND WHAT I THINK IS MISSING IN IS WHAT WERE THE ENFORCEMENTEXPENSES IN CASES WHERE RECOVERY WAS AUTHORIZED. SO I CAN MEASURE THE COST RECOVERY AGAINST THE EXPENSES IN CASES WHERE COST RECOVERY WAS AUTHORIZED AS OPPOSED TO TOTAL EXPENSES DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. AND YOU MAY NOT HAVE THIS IT MAY BE A MIS READ THIS CHART AND IF SO YOU CAN LET ME KNOW BUT IF I HAVEN'T MAYBE IF NOT NOW AT SOME POINT YOU CAN LET ME KNOW. HOW THOSE COSTS. MEASURE UP. YEAH YEAH I THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY MUCH INTELLIGENT QUESTIONS THERE ARE THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT TO ME- AT THE END WE HAVE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS AROUND THIS CHART AND AROUND PROJECTED BIRTH COLLECTED COST RECOVERY. ALSO THE ISSUE RATE THAT WE AND OUR COST RECOVERY DON'T ACCOUNT FOR THE TIME OUR ANALYSTS TO DO THAT INVESTIGATION- SO HEIR COST RECOVERY ISN'T A TRUE- ESTIMATION OF WHAT. THE BOARD ACTUALLY PUT INTO- EIGHT BRINGING THIS CASE TO- TO CLOSER- BUT I WILL NOT MAKE UP RIGHT THERE. WE'RE TO GET NEW WORDS STAY IN MY LANE- I THINK YOU KNOW IT IF YOU DON'T MIND- RECORD THING THAT THE NUMBER OF THE CHART- WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS TO GO BACK TO WITH OUR ENFORCEMENT STAFF. COMMENTED POSSIBLY FOLLOW UP WITH- BEING HE- HE HE BE ON THE BAK IN ORDER TO GIVE YOU MORE COMPLETE ANSWER- SURE IT IS. ARE YOU SURE THAT I'M LOOKING AT THE- WHY I'M LOOKING AT A MY PAY NUMBERING IS THE SAME AS THE ONE THAT'S SUPPOSED IS PAID FIFTEEN. OF THIRTY THREE PAGE. OF THIRTY THREE ON THE BACK ROW MATERIAL. AND IT LISTS EXAMPLE AN EFFORT TWENTY. TWENTY TOTAL ENFORCEMENT EXPENDITURES. POTENTIAL CASES FOR RECOVERY. CASES RECOVERY ORDERED AMOUNT OF COST RECOVERY ORDERED SEVEN- THIS IS AN THOUSAND SO. I ASSUME IT'S A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND. AND THEN THE AMOUNT COLLECTED. TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND AND I'M JUST TRYING TO THIS ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR COST RECOVERY. IN THOSE CASES WHERE COST RECOVERY IS AUTHORIZED SO I SORT OF NEED TO KNOW THE TOTAL EXPENSES IN THOSE CASES VERSUS THE TOTAL EXPENSES. SHEPHERD SURE I COULD STOP ME A FIRE TRUCK IF I PUT MY FOOT IN MY MOUTH BUT YOU KNOW SOME OF OUR MORE EGREGIOUS CASES MORE MORE MORE EXPENSIVE CASES ARE. WHERE THE- LICENSEE. JUST IT IS. WHAT GIVES UP THEIR LICENSE. AND WE NEVER HEAR FROM AGAIN THOSE CASES ARE- GREGIS PROBABLY. ARE VERY EXPENSIVE BUT ARE NOT THE KIND OF CASE THAT WE CAN CHASE AFTER THOSE PEOPLE SAFE GIVEN UP THEIR LICENSES I UNDERSTAND THAT SO I CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT OKAY THANK YOU I JUST WAS TRYING TO. TRYING TO. ONCE THE PERCENTAGES HERE AND I WASN'T SURE THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT DATA IN ORDER TO DO IT AND IF I DO JUST JUST LET ME KNOW. AND THEN I'M GOING TO STOP TALKING HERE AND ONE MICROSECOND BUT- I'VE ASKED THIS QUESTION OF OTHER BOARDS AS WELL. AND I WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATION AND DISCIPLINE. IS THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT IT TAKES. TO PROCESS A CASE ONCE TO AN INVESTIGATION HAS CONCLUDED. THAT A DECISION IS MADE TO PROCEED WITH DISCIPLINARY ACTION. AND I SEE THE TARGET ON PAGE THIRTEEN OF OUR MATERIAL IS FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY DAYS WHICH SEEMS TO BE CONSISTENT BUT AS I RECALL THE- DISCIPLINARY THE BACKGROUND PAPERS IS DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS TOOK SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX DAYS TO COMPLETE FOR COMPLAINTS AGAINST OPTOMETRISTS. AND MIKE I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT IN TOTAL OR IS THAT FROM THE DATE THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED TO THE DATE THE DISCIPLINARY ACTION IS FINISHED. I'M NOT SURE THEY UNDERSTAND THE TWO DIFFERENCES THAT IN TOTAL. FOUR EIGHT THAT YOU GIVE ME YOUR I'M I'M CONFUSED AND WALDRON WHAT I WHAT I'VE ASKED OTHER ANOTHER IN OTHER SITUATIONS WITH OTHER BOARDS I'M TRYING TO. FIGURE OUT WHERE THE DELAY OCCURS. AND IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE DELAY OCCURS I HAVE TO HAVE THE PROCESS BROKEN DOWN AND MAYBE THIS IS BRETT HAS BEEN BROKEN DOWN. SO I'M TRYING TO DECIDE IF ONE THE TARGET THE FIVE HUNDRED FORTY DAYS. IS MEASURED FROM THE DATE THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED TO THE DATE THE DISCIPLINARY ACTION IS COMPLETED. AND IN THE SPECIFIC CASE OF YOU. THE SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX DAYS TO COMPLETE. DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS INVOLVING COMPLAINTS AGAINST A TIME INTEREST. IS THAT MEASURED FROM THE DATE THE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED TO THE DATE. STARTING FROM THE DATE THE DISCIPLINARY ACTION STARTS. TO THE DAY THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE FROM THE- AND IT COULD BE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. BUT I DON'T KNOW SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO THIS IS NOT- THIS IS NOT A JEOPARDY SO YOU CAN- IF YOU CAN PROVIDE ME KNOW YOU'RE RUNNING LATER. I WON'T LIE TO BALKO ANOTHER TO ATTRACT NEW FRIENDS. AND GOT MY CHAT JOKES MY IMPORTANT OR- BY AS ASSIST ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR USED TO BE A FIFTY YARD. BURKE THE LEADER IS FOR MY NEW YEAR'S ISN'T SO IT IS A DAY THAT THE KEY- TODAY THE IT IS- IT BUT THE JUST THE HAS BEEN. METED OUT I SEE I SEE WILL WE'LL WE'LL DIG DEVELOPING. MOVED DIG DOWN WITH STAFF AND I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE DELAY IS AND IF THE DELAY IS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND I'LL- TURN MY FOCUS TO THE DOJ AND TALK TO THE DOJ ABOUT WHAT THEIR PROCESS IS IF. THE DELAY IS- IF THERE'S SOME DELAYS ON ON THE PART OF THE BOARD THEN I'LL COME BACK IN. AND TALK TO YOU ALL BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR RESPONSES AND YOUR PATIENCE. PATIENTS WITH ME. COLLEAGUES OPPOSE FOR THE DIALOGUE EDITOR. I AM CLEARLY FINISHED ANY OTHER ARE SURE LOW. CENTER PAN GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US THANK YOU THANK YOU- THANK YOU TERRA AND- AND I APPRECIATE THE- RIGHT I DID WANT TO GO BACK IN TOUCH ON THIS IS THE-CONTINUING EDUCATION I KNOW THAT- SARRAF ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT THE- HIGH FAILURE RATE WHICH- ACTUALLY WILL. I APPRECIATE YOUR EXPLANATION I THINK IT DOES STILL REPRESENT  SYSTEM FAILURE THAT- A THIRD OF A CENTURY 31% EVERYONE THE AUDITED DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT SEAT THEY NEED TO DO. AND SO PERHAPS IT NEEDS TO BE MORE CLARITY TO THE OPTOMETRY COMMUNITY AS TO WHAT TO SEE REQUIREMENTS ACTUALLY ARE IF THEY DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THEIR COURSES THEY TOOK DIDN'T FIT CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. ACCORDING TO THE BOARD BUT I ALSO WOULD MAKE NOTE OF THAT- IS MENTIONED HERE. THAT THERE ARE ONLY THREE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE AUDITS OVER THE PAST FOUR PASSED FOR FISCAL YEAR SO THAT MEANS THE ONLY AUDITED EIGHTY. FOR WEALTHY. YOU CAN ON AVERAGE EIGHTY PER YEAR THEY'VE MADE AND SOME VARIATIONS BETWEENYEARS YET ALSO YOU REPORTED YOU DUDE. TWELVE THOUSAND. RENEWALS ANNUALLY. WHICH MEANS YOU'RE ONLY AUDITING POINT 7% OF ALL THE- PEOPLE WHO ARE IN DOING ON AVERAGE- IN TERMS OF YOU SEE AUDITS AND- EVEN WITH ONLY POINT SEVEN YOU STILL FOUND THIRTY ONE PERCENT. WITH CCL YEARS- AND I THINK IT BROUGHT THIS UP AT THE LAST REVIEW IS THERE SOME INTENT TO PERHAPS I MEAN AGAIN THE ONLY DODD EVERYBODY NECESSARILY BUT PERHAPS OF LARGER SAMPLE SIZE TEN POINT 7% ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE SUCH A HIGH FAILURE RATE- AND IF IT'S- IN AGAIN. IF IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHICH CEDAR SUPPOSED TO TAKE PERHAPS YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT USE THAT FEEDBACK TO IMPROVE THE COMMUNICATION SO THAT WE SEE AN IMPROVEMENT AND THE COMPLIANCE RATE WITH. WITH THE COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO YOUR PLANS FOR. AUDITS INTO THE FUTURE IN TERMS OF THE RATE THE PERCENTAGE YOU'RE ACTUALLY PLANT AUDIT OF THE RENEWALS. YOUR TARGET FOR EACH YEAR IT'S FOUR. YEARS WE HAD LET OUR 5% EACH YEAR- AND IN FACT WE'VE HAD. ANY IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. WHAT LOSS OF STAFF- HERE WE HAVE NOT BEEN A TO- YEAH. THE EQUINE ON IT I'M A BIT THE NATION BEFORE- WE THE L. NATALIE RECOGNIZED- WHO JUST WALK AGAIN ANOTHER SENIOR STAFF WORK WITHOUT NUMBER- IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS BUT- WE ARE HIRING TO BACK FILL THAT ON A AND E'S OSTACLE YOU'RE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. I'M MORE OPERATE BRING INTENT HEALTH LICENSING AND ENFORCEMENT I'M ALSO CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH THE HIRING PROCESS BUT WHICH HIRED A NEW WITH COMPLETELY WHAT I WANNA DO IS. MAKE SURE THAT WE GOT THE HELP THAT WE GOT CROSS TRAINING ACROSS MORE EXACT. UNTIL IT'S NOT VIOLATE ONE ONE PERSON LEAD THE PROGRAM. IT'S JUST NO LONGER UP. UNTIL WE ANTICIPATE A LOT OF THE LATTER. OF CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY. TRAINING AT- AND- PRODUCE MORE OF THE TRAINING PROCESS AND THE CONTINUING THAT IS- PORTION OF MORE JACK I'M NOT A FIVE ACROSS. OKAY SO HEAR THE GOLD FIVE FOR A YEAR WHICH IS KIND OF SIMILAR TO OTHER BOY BUT- I WOULD MAKE NO THAT. AND YET I APPRECIATE YOUR- ISSUES- DEALER IT SPIN QUITE A FEW YEARS ARE READY SIR- AND I BROUGHT IT UP THE LAST REVIEW SO- HOPEFULLY THIS'LL BE MORE OF A- IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GET TO THAT 5% ANDY AND THEN AGAIN AS I MENTIONED- ALSO BETTER EITHER BUT WE NEED TO CLARIFY THE REQUIREMENTS OR DO SOME OTHER THING BECAUSE THE TURNS OUT YEAH AND IT IS PROBLEMATIC SOMEWHERE SOMETHING'S GONE WRONG SOMEWHERE THERE SO IT'S EITHER THE APPLICANTS ARE DOING IT. BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THERE'S SOME RISK UNDERSTANDING THAN WE NEED BETTER COMMUNICATION THE OTHER QUESTION ABOUT THE C. E. IS THAT. DOING EDUCATION IS THAT DO YOU HAVE DOES THE BOARD HAVE ANY POLICY OR THERE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO CERTIFIED THE C. E. AND TERMS OF ENSURING THAT THERE ARE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BETWEEN THE PEOPLE PRESENTING THE C. E. THAT THEY'LL HAVE FINANCIAL CONFLICTS SO WE WANNA BE SURE DISCONTINUING EDUCATION NOT A MARKETING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AT. TEACHING THIS. HE SPEAK TO A CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICIES FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION. SO I CAN. TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THAT QUESTION- BEFORE I BECAME THE PRESIDENT BORE I SERVED ON THE- ON THE SPROXIL EDUCATION COMMITTEE. AND THAT COMMITTEE REVIEWS ALMOST ALL THE- PRESENTATIONS BEFORE THEY'RE APPROVED- INCLUDING THE SPEAKERS THEIR BACKGROUNDS. AND THE MATERIALS THE ACTUAL POWER POINTS- THAT WILL BE PRESENTED. OUR SHARE IS A AT UC BERKELEY OPTOMETRY PROFESSOR. AND AS YOU MIGHT GUESS- DEFINITION OF EDUCATION IS PRETTY HOT. AND I CAN SAY BASED ON MY SERVICE ON THE PRACTICING EDUCATION COMMITTEE- THE BOARD MEMBERS ON THAT COMMITTEE ARE ARE NOT GOING TO IMPROVE SOME YELP SALES JOB YOU KNOW SOME AMWAY OR AYE DON'T WANT TO DISCOURAGE FAMILY BUT I'VE BEEN YOU KNOW COAXED INTO THESE YOU KNOW MARKETING SCHEMES THAT THAT WITHOUT. WITHOUT BEINGINFORMED AT THE OUTSET SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THE MATERIALS AND I BELIEVE REJECTED FROM SOME- PRESENTATIONS BECAUSE IT DOES LOOK LIKE MARKETING AND WE NEED TO FOCUS ON IT HAS TO BE EDUCATION. SO I APPRECIATE THAT WORKS DONE I THINK COULD BE HELPFUL SINCE OF THE BOARD HAS THAT ROLE IN REVIEWING AND APPROVING- CONTINUING EDUCATION. THAT PERHAPS THERE SHOULD BE SOME BOARD POLICY AS WELL THAT- BACKS UP THIS ACTIVITY. REGARDING DISCLOSING FINANCIAL INTERESTS AND OF COURSE- BE SURE THAT THERE'S CLEARLY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING THESE COURSES THAT IT OKAY BEEN REVIEWED FOR THESE FINANCIAL CONFLICTS OF THERE ARE. EITHER DEAD THEY'RE NOT PROVED OR ALSO IF- IF IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S NOT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO BE OF MAJOR CONCERN BUT STILL THAT PEOPLE ARE DISCLOSING THE POTENTIAL FINANCIAL CONFLICTS TO THE LEARNERS. UP FRONT- SO IF YOU CAN I THINK DEVELOPING SUCH A POLICY. TO HELP REINFORCE WHAT SOUNDS LIKE MAY YOUR BOARD MEMBERS RATE DOING I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL- KNOWING THAT THERE'S GOING TO TURN OVER ON. BOARDS AS WELL SO SURE SURE OKAY AND THEN ONE JUST ONE OTHER QUESTION- REGARDING CHILD AND ISSUE SEVENTEEN CHILDHOOD VISION SCREENINGS. I'M A P. I TAKE CARE CHILDREN DISOBEY- OBVIOUSLY VISION SCREENINGS VERY IMPORTANT- WHILE WE'RE CLOSELY WITH OPTOMETRISTS ON THAT. I ALSO WANT ALSO BE SURE WE'RE DOING EVIDENCE BASED SCREENING SO WE'RE NOT- YOU. AND SO I THINK THAT- HOPEFULLY IN ADDRESSING- CHILDHOOD VISION SCREENINGS AND AT LEAST FOR THE BOARD'S ROLE IN THAT THAT- YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH PEOPLE IN- THE- LEARNING DISABILITIES AND OTHER DISABILITIES COMMUNITY AND WITH PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PEOPLE AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS TAKING CARE OF THESE CHILDREN. COMING UP WITH A- REASONABLE- WAY TO BE SURE THAT CHILDREN ARE VISION SCREENIKNOW THAT SCHOOLS DO THAT PEDIATRICIANS DO THAT OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T DO IT AT THE SAME WITH THE SAME LEVEL AS AS OPTOMETRISTS BUT YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE A PRIVATE BROADER DISCUSSION TO ENSURE THAT WE DO SCREEN CHILDREN FOR- VISION DEFECTS. THAT ARE APPROPRIATE AND OTHER THAN SPACED THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR PAN MEMBERS ANY OTHER CENTER CHIRLA. YES I'D LIKE TO GO BACK IF I CAN'T TO THE QUESTION ABOUT AUDIT THESE AUDIT SHOULD WE TALK ABOUT- OR THE LACK THEREOF ARE. WHICH TRIGGERS THE AUDIT IS AT AN INVESTIGATION. OF A COMPLAINT WOULD INVESTIGATION BROUGHT APART BECAUSE THE COMPLAINT. WHAT IS A SEQUENCE THERE. SO IF YOU HAVE HAD A PREVIOUS VIOLATION- YOU WERE AUDITED AT RANDOM- AND WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS A COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEE I REQUIREMENTS. THEN YOU CAN BE THROWN BACK IN. TO BE BE AUDITED MORE QUICKLY BUT- BEGINNING OF THAT THE BASICALLY A RANDOM- PICKING OUT OF THE FIVE PERCENT- THE- APPLICANT I THINK I'LL DO IT WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE RIGHT NUMBERS BECAUSE NOT ALL OF OUR TWELVE THOUSAND- YOU KNOW WE WILL BE EACH YEAR REQUIRED CONTINUING EDUCATION OUR OBJECTIONS THAT WORK AT THAT POINT DO NOT REQUIRE CONTINUING EDUCATION SO- AND THEN OF COURSE- YOU KNOW OUR OUR OPTICAL DISPENSING BUSINESSES. I ALSO DON'T REQUIRE EDUCATION- AND YOU'LL- DON'T REQUIRE COMPLETE EDUCATION AND WHERE YOU'LL- RESEARCH MAKE IT OUTSIDE OF A LOCAL ONE I DON'T LOOK SURGERY. I DON'T APPLY THE JURY EDUCATION ARE A LITTLE BIT THAN FALL THOUSAND SO I THINK WE'RE A LITTLE BIT THAT IS NOT SEVEN. ALTHOUGH IT THAT IT IS CERTAINLY YEAR WE'VE HAD THE FIVE YEARS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE DO THE OTHER- AND SO TRIGGERED THAT EFFECT. HAVE IN THE PAST- AND ENFORCEMENT ANALYST ARE DEDICATED- AT THE END OF THE YEAR OR DURING DOWNTIME ONLY FIVE PERCENT- ALL OF THE APPLICATIONS THAT WE RECEIVE BETWEEN THAT HERE A LITTLE BIT THE TWELVE CALENDAR MONTHS BEFORE ON IN ORDER TO RANDOMLY THEN CONTACT THE LIGHTENED B.

AND SO I THINK ANYONE WHO HAS AN INTEREST IN PUBLIC SERVICE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO OUR EFFORTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I THINK IF I ADDED THAT SHE LED HOLIDAY. NO PLEASE PERCENT I THINK THAT. I WALDRON FEDERAL. IRAN I JUST WONDER IF BONTA DIGITALLY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN WE COULD USE YOUR HELP AND IN DOING THAT ADVERTISING SO- HAVING WORKED IN THE ASSEMBLY AND WORKS WITH IT THE SPEAKER DR NUMBER SERVICES THEY KNOW THAT ALL OF YOU ARE DILIGENT ABOUT ON. COMMUNICATING TO YOUR GUEST. SO IF YOU'VE GOT A NEW. OR UP. OR IF THOSE WHO AND- WHERE WOULD APPROPRIATE PLEASE LET FOLKS KNOW THE BE THE- ARE THE INFORMATION IS A- ON OUR WEBSITE- I AM ALSO MORE THAN WILLING- HELP. INDIVIDUAL LEGISLATOR STAFF. IN ORDER TO. GET THEM WHICH WILL THEY NEED TO DO THAT BUT WHAT I REALLY IN THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE YOUR CONSENT YOU ARE AND- JUST TO HAVE THE ORDER TO WORK WITH THE BUSINESS. GREAT PUBLIC SERVICE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WOULD BE A GREAT BOOST TO THE. OUTRAGE THAT WE'RE DEALING. WELL I WAS GONNA SAY BEFORE I IT OVER TO MIKE. SAID BATES IS. YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN IN BEFORE I CAME UP HERE I WAS OBVIOUSLY A FAIRLY ACTIVE IN THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES IN THE REGION AND- ORGANIZATIONS AND FRANKLY. IT MAY HAVE CHANGED BUT CERTAINLY AT THE TIME AND UP TO THE TIME I CAME UP HERE. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT IT WAS EASY TO FIND THE BOARDS. AND IT WAS EASY TO FIND THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS AND WHICH ONES REPUBLICAN WHICH ONES WERE NOT. BUT IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND WHICH BOARD SAID VACANCIES IN WHICH PORTS IN PARTICULAR HAD PUBLIC VACANCIES. DIFFICULT TO FIND IT ON THE WEBSITE SO I'M NOT EVEN SURE IT AT THAT TIME THAT YOU COULD. AND YOU HAVE CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE YOU HAVE BOARDS OF REALTORS YOU HAVE A VARIETY OF ORGANIZATIONS. IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN OUR DISTRICTS AND AROUND THE STATE. AND IF IN I'M TALKING TO THE BOARD PERSONNEL NOW IN YOUR DEALINGS WITH THE FIRST FLOOR AND WITH THE APPOINTMENT SECRETARY AND- THE ADMINISTRATION. I THINK IF IT IS NOT AVAILABLE READILY AVAILABLE TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WE NEED TO THINK THROUGH HOW WE PUBLICIZE. IN SOME EASILY ACCESSIBLE LOCATION. THE VACANCIES AND OPENINGS FOR OUR PUBLIC MEMBERS. SO THAT WE CAN NOT ONLY HELP YOU RECRUIT BUT THAT CAN COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS OF ALL SORTS AROUND THE STATE CAN HELP YOU DO SO. I THINK- I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY VERY HELPFUL AGAIN SITUATION MAY HAVE CHANGED SINCE THE LAST TIME I TOOK A CLOSE LOOK AT IT BUT IF NOT. I THINK WE NEED TO TUNE IT UP A LITTLE BIT. CENTER BATES. WHEN I NEEDED THEM. I THANK YOU A VERY VERY INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION AND LET ME APOLOGIZE TO MY COLLEAGUES AND CERTAINLY TO BOARD MEMBERS ARE. BETTER HERE AND- THE ADMINISTRATIVE- REPRESENTATIVES I HAD A LITTLE PLUMBING PROBLEM THIS MORNING IF I AM GOING AT MY AGING HOUSE- RIGHT NOW I'M NOT SURE YOU COVERED THE MOBILE OPTOMETRIC OFFICES ISSUE ON PAGE THIRTY ONE OF THIRTY THREE. YEAH AND IF YOU DID- THEN I CAN GET MY QUESTIONS ANSWERED- YOU KNOW SURVEYS THAT YOU HADN'T GOODNESS YOUR QUESTION IT WAS COVERED BRIEFLY BUT- YOU MIGHT COME AT IT FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION SO. WHAT I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALOHA CERTAINLY- HIS WORK IN THIS FIELD IS BANNED SO- I NOTED AND IT'S ABOUT THE- EIGHTY EIGHT NINETY SIX AND TWENTY TWENTY ENACTED AND WEATHER OUT THERE WAS A REPORT UPDATING ON THE REAL MAKING FOR THAT A WHICH IS DUE ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THE REASON I BRING IT UP AS THE MOBILE OPTOMETRIC OFFICES AND THAT VISION TO LEARN THAT WHOLE PROGRAM STARTED WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND IT WAS SO IMPORTANT AND EFFECTIVE. IN THE COMMUNITIES ON THAT WERE LOW INCOME AND UNDERSERVED AND WE KNOW WHAT OUR KIDS. BACK TO THAT ISSUE. THAT THEIR- ISSUES ARE DISCUSSED EARLY ACTS MY DAUGHTER. AND WE DO LIVE IN A AREA WE WERE. THAT OF THOSE ASKING AND SHE WAS. TO HAVE A VISION PROBLEM WHICH SHE NEVER REPORTED TO US IN THE EARLY GRADES THAT SHE WAS HAVING TROUBLE A PROBLEM SEEN THE BLACKBOARD. BUT WHEN THEY DID SOME OF THAT SCHOOL- FROM REVIEWS AND JOHN TESTING THEY ARE LET US KNOW THAT SHE HAD A PROBLEM SO. I JUST FOCUS ON IT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT AND MAKING SURE THAT. YOU KNOW THE YOUNG. EIGHTY EIGHT NINETY SIX AND THE RULE MAKING IS GOING FORWARD AND YOU MAY HAVEALREADY REPORTED ON THAT HASSEL YOU CAN MAKE A VERY BRIEF IF YOU HAVE JUST SO I UNDERSTAND. OF THAT STUFF OFF MY QUESTION LIST. WELL I'LL START INSURANCE YOU CAN SUMMARIZE OUR EARLY ANCESTORS AND MY UNDERSTANDING THE LEGISLATION IS THAT ONCE THE LEGISLATION PASSED THE. THE GLOBAL CLINICS WERE. OR A GREEN LIGHT AND WE HAD THE BOARD HAD KIND OF A RAMP UP TO WORK ON THE ON THE REGULATIONS COURSE THE PANDEMIC- BUT WE'VE TO SURE AS TO WHAT ADMINISTRATIVE WE WE'VE BEEN DOING A KEY TO GET THE RULE MAKING THAT. GREAT THANK YOU ARE JUST ARE JUST THAT A SINGLE THANK YOU. KEEP READING FOR THE CENTER BATES. NO THAT'S IT THANK YOU THIS IS WRONG THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. I SEE NO OTHER MICROPHONES UP NO HANDS IN THE AIR NOTHING FROM THOSE WHO ARE MONITORING THE PRECEDING REMOTELY SO. LET'S NOT ACCEPT TESTIMONY FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE- BOARD OF OPTOMETRY. BEGINNING WITH WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY I SEE NONE WITNESSES IN ROOM ONE TWELVE. BYE SHE NONE MOVING TO WITNESSES WAITING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT VIA THE TELECONFERENCE ARMOS MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PLEASE PROMPT ANY SUCH INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT. WE WILL BEGIN. THANK YOU TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT OVER THE TELEPHONE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO BEGIN USING YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD HMI PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE DO HAVE ONE LINE IN Q. WE JUST A MOMENT PLEASE THANK YOU. WE ALMOST HAVE IT I APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY. FORGOTTEN LINE NUMBER LINE FOURTEEN ONE FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THIS IS CHRISTINE SCHULTZ REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA OPTOMETRIC ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT TODAY WE SUPPORT THE BOARD SUNSET EXTENSION AND APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THE BOARD IS DONE OVER THE PST FOUR YEARS ESPECIALLY MISS MURPHY SUFFERED IN. RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC. I ALSO APPRECIATE THE OPEN LINES OF COMMUNICATION REPORTS THAT. THERE ARE A FEW ISSUES I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT. FIRST YOUR QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW ONLINE VISION TESTING THAT ALLOWS YOU TO FILL IN AYE GLASSES OR CONTACT LENS PRESCRIPTION WITHOUT SEEING A DOCTOR HAS A STRONG POTENTIAL FOR HARM. THESE TESTS CAN DIAGNOSE GLAUCOMA I BLOOD PRESSURE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE BRAIN TUMORS A NUMBER OF OTHER CONDITIONS THAT ARE OFTEN DETECTOR AND I EXAM. WORSE YET THE WAY SOME OF THESE TESTS ARE ADVERTISED. THE PATIENT THINKS THEY HAD AN EYE EXAM. IT'S NOT HOW MUCH PRESCRIBED. I HAD A PRESCRIPTION WITHOUT DOING TEST THE DAY THESE CONDITIONS IT WOULD BE UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT. CONTACT LENSES GENERALLY HAVE A ONE YEAR EXPIRATION FOR A REASON THEY REQUIRING ANNUAL MONITORING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT CAUSING ANY IRRITATION OR SOME OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE I. OUR DOCTORS THE A LOT OF CORNEAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF CONTACT LENSES THAT ARE NOT WORN PROPERLY. ONLINE CONTACT LENS PRESCRIPTION EXTENSIONS MAKE THIS PROBLEM MUCH WORSE. THE DOCTORS WHO APPROVED THESE PRESCRIPTION SHOULDBE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD AS IN PERSON CARE. WE'RE ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE BOARD'S INABILITY TO ENFORCE THE LAW RELIGIOUS OPTICIANS. YOU JUST CAN'T HAVE SOME COMPANY FLAT OUT REFUSED TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW AND STILL. OPEN MORE LOCATIONS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE BOARD AND THE LEGISLATURE IN THE COMING. FEW MONTHS IN FIND SOLUTIONS TO GET THE STATE BOARD THE PORTIONS FORTY IT NEEDS. ALSO VERY ABOUT THE INDIOS REFUSAL TO OFFER MORE LOCATIONS FOR THE NATIONAL BOARD TEST. WE HOPE TO WORK WITH THE BOARD OF OPTOMETRY ON FINDING THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. CREATED BY HAVING ONLY ONE TESTING SITE LOCATED ALL THE WAY ON THE EAST COAST. BUT CAN THEY MAKE IS REALLY TAUGHT US NEED MORE FLEXIBILITY IN A LOCK. AS SUCH WE SUPPORT THE BOARD HAVING ITS OWN STATE OF EMERGENCY STATUTE ALLOWING IT TO WAIVE PROVISIONS OF THE OPTOMETRIC PRACTICE. THAT DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY. I ALSO WANT TO TOUCH ON THE CONCERNS. ABOUT THE PRACTICE LAW. TODAY'S CALIFORNIA COMMENTERS. ARE TRYING TO DO SO MUCH MORE THAN THEIR PERMITTED IN CALIFORNIA. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WHY SPEND ALL THIS MONEY EDUCATING OPTOMETRISTS AND THEN PREVENTING THEM FROM PRACTICING TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THAT TRAINING. TOM AND OTHER STATES FOR MORE MINOR SURGICAL. INCLUDING THE USE OF LASERS TO TRICKLE COME OUT WITH NO PROBLEMS. THE LINE CALIFORNIA SO SPECIFIC IT CAN'T CHANGES TECHNOLOGY CHANGES. NO OTHER STATE IN THE NATION WITH ALL THE DRUGS AND THE CONDITIONS ARE ALLOWED IN STATUTE IT IS A PROBLEM FOR PATIENT CARE. I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE WE HAVE A NEW DRUG WHICH VERY FEW SIDE EFFECTS THAT INDICATED TO TREAT AN ISLAND CONDITION. COULD ONLY PREVIOUSLY BE TREATED WITH SURGERY BUT AN OPTOMETRIST CAN'T USE IT BECAUSE A LOT OF ALLOW THE TREATMENT THAT CONDITION. CALIFORNIA DEMOCRAT IS CONFUSING AND ANTIQUATED AND WE NEED TO FIND ANOTHER. WAY OF GETTING PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE TREATMENT THEY NEED. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. NEXT PLEASE. THANK YOU THERE ARE NO OTHER LINES INTO IT THIS TIME THANK YOU MR MODERATOR MEMBERS ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OR CONCERNS ABOUT THE BOARD OF OPTOMETRY. SEEING NONE THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH WE'RE WILL NOW MOVE TO THE BOARD OF BARBERING AND COSMETOLOGY. MISTER STEVE WEEKS BOARD PRESIDENT WILL PRESENT MISTER WEEKS IF YOU'RE WITH ISSUE MAY PROCEED. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN ROB GERMINAL SENATORS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS STEVE WEEKS OFF AND I AM A MEMBER OF THE BOARD HOUSE METROLOGY. PRESENTING WITH ME TODAY IS OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER CHRISTIAAN DOUBLE. I WAS APPOINTED TO THE BOARD ON JULY TWENTY EIGHTH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN RIGHT AND SENATE. PRO TEM KEVIN DE LEON AND I WAS RE APPOINTED ON JANUARY TWENTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE BY SENATE PRO TEM TWENTY ACTS. AS A PUBLIC MEMBER OF THE BOARD. IT'S JUST BEEN AN ENLIGHTENING EXPERIENCE TO LEARN FIRSTHAND THE ROLE THAT THE BOARD PLACING PROVIDING CONSUMER PROTECTION TO SO MANY CALIFORNIANS. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ALL HAVE RECEIVED VERY DETAILED BACKGROUND PAPER ON REPORTS WHILE NOT TAKE UP THE COMMITTEES TIME NOW WITH THE HISTORY OF THE BOARD. I WOULD TOUCH VERY BRIEFLY ON A FEW POINTS THAT MAY BE OF VALUE TO DESPAIRING. OUR BOARD ONE OF THE LARGEST COSMETOLOGY AND BARBERING BOARDS IN THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND LICENSEES AND TWO HUNDRED FORTY SIX APPROVED SCHOOLS THE NUMBERS ARE REALLY STAGGERING WE MONITOR FIFTY THOUSAND ESTABLISHMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH THE TALENTED AND DEDICATED STAFF OF LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS. SINCE OUR LAST SUNSET REVIEW THE BORDER SEEN MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS WHEN WE ARE MOST PROUD OF IS OUR IMPROVEMENT IN LANGUAGE ACCESS FOR EXAMS IN OUR PUBLICATIONS ARE OFFERED VIETNAMESE SPANISH AND KOREAN. WE HAVE SINCE EXPANDED TRANSLATIONS OF OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS THE FARSI ARABIC IN TRADITIONAL AND SIMPLIFIED CHINESE. WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR OUTREACH TO DIVERSE POPULATION IN FACT JUST EARLIER THIS WEEK WE HELD VIRTUAL EVENTS IN SPANISH AND VIETNAMESE ON HOW TO STAY SAFE DURING THE PANDEMIC. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT SINCE OUR LAST REVIEW OUR BORDERS WORK WITH THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY BUT WE WERE ABLE TO STOP FRAUDULENT SCHOOLS THAT WERE BASICALLY OPERATING AS DEPLOYMENT HOUSE WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST THREE SCHOOLS THAT WERE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF STUDENTS AND NOT PROVIDING THEM. THE EDUCATION THEY DESERVE. AS YOU KNOW THE BARB BECAUSE- INDUSTRY HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BECAUSE OF THE COLD BUT NINETEEN AND DEMI. OUR BORDER SPENT THE LAST YEAR WORKING TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE PANDEMIC AND EDUCATE LICENSEES ON HOW TO KEEP THEMSELVES AND THEIR CLIENTS SAFE DURING THIS DIFFICULT UNPRECEDENTED TIMES. WE TRANSITIONED OUR INSPECTORS CAME FROM AN ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE TO AN EDUCATIONAL PERSPECTIVE. WE HAVE DEVELOPED MATERIALS DESIGNED TO HELP OUR LICENSEES GET BACK TO WORK SAFELY AND WE WORKED DIRECTLY WITH MANY COUNTIES ON JOINT VISITS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON CALL THAT NINETEEN TESTING. INDUSTRY GUIDELINES ON SAFE PRACTICES AND INFORMATION ON THE STATUS OF STATEWIDE RESTRICTIONS WE WERE ALSO PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE WHERE WE AGAIN PROVIDED VALUABLE EDUCATION AND IN SOME CASES DISCIPLINE OF LICENSEES WERE PUTTING FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS HI REST. THE BORDERS AWARE OF THE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS TO MINIMIZE ANY BARRIER TO ENTRY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO PURSUING THIS FURTHER WITH COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF. OUR BOARD IS READY TO TAKE ON THE CHALLENGES OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE THE MANY SERVICES WE PROVIDE. WE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS ANY OF YOUR CONCERNS AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXTEND OUR GRATITUDE TO THE STAFF. OF BOTH COMMITTEES FOR THE COMMUNICATION TO THE PROVIDED TO OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND ARE BORED WITH THAT WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISTER WEEKS WILL OF CHRISTY UNDER WOULD. BE PROVIDING ANY COMMENT. NO IT DOES NOT COMMENT OKAY. MANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF OUR COMMITTEES. LOW. LET ME START OFF WITH A COUPLE AND THEN I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES WILL JUMP IN IF THEY- DAVID APPROPRIATE. I'M CURIOUS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE CONTINUALLY GRAPPLE WITH. IN THESE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEES IS BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT AND ACCESS AND IN READING THE- BACKGROUND MATERIAL I WAS. STRUCK BY OF THE COST. IF FOR EXAMPLE A PRIVATE COLLEGE COSMETOLOGY FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR OF SIXTEEN HUNDRED OUR COURSE AND I WAS JUST CURIOUS. IF YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT ON THE AVERAGE IT TAKES A COSMETOLOGIST TO. TO RECOVER THE COST OF THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY. WE WELL THAT ARE EXPECTED OFFICER- ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT AGAIN THE COST OF EDUCATION COSMETOLOGY EDUCATION REALLY CAN VERY SICK CAN BE EXPENSIVE AND SOME PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND YET IT CAN BE RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE I GO THROUGH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOW SO I'LL LET HER SPEAK TO THAT BUT WE WILL JUST TO SET THE STAGE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THEY'RE ONLY ABOUT TEN. OR SO GIVE OR TAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS- STILL EXISTING IN THE STATE IS THAT CORRECT. THANK YOU THINK. SORRY WE'RE HAVING IRAN YOU JUST HAVE TO SPEAK UP FOR OLD PEOPLE LIKE ME. WELL NOW ONE MAN NO I'M NOT HEARING YOU AT ALL. MY LIP READING SKILLS HAVE ATROPHIED. NO. SEVEN I THINK WE'RE- WE'RE HAVING A SOUND PROBLEM MA'AM. WE'RE WORKING THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY. AND WE WILL WE WILL COMPENSATE A LITTLE NOW I HAVE NOT OUR OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS COME DOWN HERE AND WE CAN CERTAINLY SHARE THE SAME DEVICE. THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME OK NOW PERFECTLY. ALL WE ARE SO SORRY FOR THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW A PERFECTLY WE EXPERIENCED A LOT OF THE TIME DON'T WORRY THANK YOU. I AM SO GOING BACK TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES ONE OF THE THINGS IS I DO THINK THERE'S MORE THAN TEN AND WE COULD GET THOSE EXACT NUMBERS AND YOU KNOW THEY THEY ARE NOT AS MANY AS WE WOULD HOPE TO SEE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT I DO THINK I AM VERY IT'S A GREAT PROGRAM THAT THEY HAVE IN THOSE IN THOSE LOCATIONS. AND I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW THEY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT ARE IN EFFECT. LARGE AND ENROLLMENT. AND SO IT IT DEFINITELY IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE IF MORE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WOULD TAKE TAKE THAT ON. AND THEN I'M GOING BACK TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE COST OF THE OF THE- DAY EDUCATION AND HOW THEY- RECOVERED THAT AFTER THEIR LICENSE. IT REALLY M. WE DON'T AND WE DON'T REALLY TRACK EMPLOYMENT OF OUR LICENSEES SO WELL THEY THEY DO GET A LICENSE AND THEN AND- THAT'S KIND OF IT FOR WHERE WHERE WHERE WE OTHER THAN ENFORCEMENT OF HEALTH AND SAFETY. AND SO WE HAVEN'T REALLY EVER STUDIED BE INCOME ASPECT AFTER LICENSURE AND- WE DON'T WE DON'T MAINTAIN ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE STUDENTS WHEN THEY'RE IN CHOOL AND HOW THEY HOW THEY ATTENDED SCHOOL IF THEY'VE GONE THROUGH. AND A STUDENT AID PROGRAM OR NOT AND SO WE DON'T HAVE THAT DATA AND IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING WE COULD WORK WITH THE BUREAU PRIVATE POST SECONDARY TO OBTAIN NOW. WHAT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE BUREAU AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S AND IT'S AN ISSUE AN INTEREST AREA FOR. ME PERSONALLY- TO MAKE SURE THAT IT FOR PUTTING TRAINING PROGRAMS OUT THERE THAT HE TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY TRAINING PEOPLE FOR JOBS. FOR GOOD PAYING JOBS THAT ACTUALLY EXIST AND THAT WERE NOT SIMPLY RACKING UP EDUCATIONAL DEBT FOR WHICH INDIVIDUALS EITHER CANNOT PAY OR SPEND CONSIDERABLE PERIODS OF TIME TRYING TO PAY OFF- IN THE FUTURE LET ME THEN SHIFT TO. OF THE REQUIRED HOURS OF INSTRUCTION- THE NECESSARY TO SECURE- OF WHAT LICENSURE- AND- AND ULTIMATELY POSITIONS IN THE BARBERING AND COSMETOLOGY FIELD IN THE STATE- BUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS REQUIRED FOR COSMETOLOGY. OTHERS SOME APPRENTICESHIP I GUESS ISSUES BUT THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED HOURS FOR BARBERING. HOW WERE THOSE REQUIREMENTS SET I NOTICED THAT THE HOURS ARE- EVEN IN NUMBER- WHICH IS SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL I THINK IN THE EDUCATIONAL AREA. CAN SOMEONE ADDRESS THAT FOR ME. SURE I AM I THINK THE HOURS HAVE BEEN SET MANY MANY YEARS AGO M. SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS IS WHAT WE HAVE FOR. COSMETOLOGY RIGHT NOW AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN IN EFFECT FOR. QUITE SOME TIME AND I'VE PERSONALLY BEEN AT THE BOARD FOR SIXTEEN YEARS AND I KNOW IT WAS. THAT AND LONG BEFORE I ATTENDED AND- SO YOU KNOW HOW IT WAS ORIGINALLY THOUGHT OF BACK IN THE BEGINNING I'M NOT POSITIVE AND- WE HAVE DONE SOME CURRICULUM REVIEW OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS BUT THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS HAS. HAS REMAINED AND BEEN. FOR MANY YEARS IT'S BEEN PRETTY CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND THERE'S BEEN. LOTS OF BRICK AND CHANGES OVER AND YEARS IN VARIOUS STATE. I AM WHICH I BELIEVE YOU KNOW IS NOTED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER AND- SO AND- YOU KNOW IT'S- CLOSE IN STATE THE- THE MAJORITY OF STATES RIGHT NOW- RIGHT AT FIFTEEN HUNDRED. M. AND THERE'S YOU KNOW A FEW STATES THAT ARE- EVEN OVER AND SIXTEEN HUNDRED. SO IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT- HAS BEEN IN PLACE. IN THIS- INDUSTRY. FOR JUST A NUMBER OF YEARS. WELL I MEAN LOOKING AT THE- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M COMPARING OCCUPATIONS APPLES TO APPLES HERE BUT- IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COSMETOLOGY AND IF I'VE GOT THE RIGHT INFORMATION LOOKING AT THE BACKGROUND. PAPER IT INDICATES THAT VERMONT IN TEXAS ARE NOW TO THOUSAND HOURS. IN RHODE ISLAND WENT FROM FIFTEEN HUNDRED HOURS TO SIX HUNDRED HOURS. IN VARIOUS MMHM. THE NEW YORK HAS A LOWER REQUIREMENT THAN WE DO AND THAT SORT OF UNUSUAL SO I'M I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO WHAT SORT OF A REGULAR WE'VE APPLIED TO MAKING SURE THAT THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED FOR THESE OCCUPATIONS BARBERING COSMETOLOGY IN THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES THAT FALL. VETERANS SOCIAIS DID WITH THOSE. THAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE CURRENT. AND THAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS AS OPPOSED TO. CONDITIONS THAT SOMEONE JUST WANTS TO IMPOSE CAN YOU CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT FOR ME. ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT AND WE KNOW TEXAS MAKE THE CHANGE FROM FROM SIXTEEN HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND AND AS YOU MENTIONED NEW YORK SENATE THOUSAND FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND SO I DEFINITELY THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT OUR OUR BOARD MEETS CHIU M. NEEDS TO LOOK AT THEM THE TIMES HAVE CHANGED AND I THINK- WE ARE YOU KNOW WE ARE MORE THAN WILLING WE KNOW THIS IS A NATIONAL DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING AS WELL. AND I DEFINITELY THINK BARBARA COURTS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEES TO DETERMINE AND IF THE HOURS SHOULD BE REDUCED TO M. TO ALLOW BETTER ENTRY INTO THE INTO THE INDUSTRY. I WAS TAKEN BY THE FACT THAT THERE'S ONLY A ONE HUNDRED HOUR DIFFERENCE IN TRAINING REQUIRED FOR BARBERS AS OPPOSED TO COSMETOLOGISTS AND WHILE I'M BY AS I UNDERSTAND WHEN I READ THE OCCUPATIONAL DESCRIPTIONS BERBERS CAN BARBERING CERTAINLY INVOLVES HER COLORING. IN THE LAKE. BUT MY- PROBABLY ON. PINE CERTAINLY NON PROFESSIONAL A VIEW OF IT IS COSMETOLOGY INVOLVES MUCH MORE. THAT COULD INVOLVE MUCH MORE TECHNICAL ASPECTS HAVING TO DO WITH HAIR COLORING AND OTHER SORTS OF TECHNIQUES THAT CHEMICAL USE THAT. YOU MIGHT NOT SEE IT A TYPICAL BARBER SHOP. AM I AM TAKEN BY THE FACT THAT THERE'S ONLY A ONE HUNDRED HOUR DIFFERENCE IN THE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS CAN SOMEONE ADDRESS THAT FOR ME. SURE THAT THAT'S CORRECT THERE'S ONLY ONE HUNDRED HOURS A COSMETOLOGIST IS TRAINED TO M. NOT ONLY DO CARE SERVICES BUT ALSO DO SKIN AND NAIL SERVICES AND SO THE COSMETOLOGY LICENSES IT'S AN INSTANCE OF A MASTER LICENSE AND A SENSE THAT IT. AND HOWEVER AS THOSE AREAS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BARBER% IS AND THEY PUT ON THEIR MORE COMMON TO SHAPE THEM AND PROVIDE AND THE SHAVINGS OF AND STEP HERE FOR THE BEARD AND SO. THE ONE HUNDRED HOURS AND WHY IT IS THAT DIFFERENCE- A BARBER CANNOT USE INTERNALS BUT AND DOES IT HAVE THE ADDED EDUCATION FOR THE SHAPING ASPECTS SO- AGAIN IT'S ANOTHER TREND AS WELL THAT WE HAVE SEEN THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE- LOOKED AT AND I AM I DEFINITELY THINK OUR BOARD IS IN THE POSITION NOW TO. AND TO MAKE YOU KNOW SO TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEES TO MAKE SOME CHANGES WELL OBVIOUSLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY COLLEAGUES THINK ABOUT THIS BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS ISN'T. AN ISSUE OF CONCERN TO ME BECAUSE IT MAY VERY WELL BE THAT FIFTEEN HUNDRED HOURS FOR BARBER BARBERS AND SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS FOR COSMETOLOGIST UPON REVIEW APPEARS TO BE APPROPRIATE I WILL NOTE IF IN FACT IT'S ACCURATE THAT AND I HAVE NO PROBLEM BY THE WAY WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY INSTRUCTION. INSTRUCTION. ON BACTERIOLOGICAL BACK. OLOGY AND SIGNET SUBJECT LIKE THE- I'M NOT WITH THAT BEING INCLUDED BUT THE BACKGROUND PAPERS SEEM TO SUGGEST THAT THAT TOTAL SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY HOURS OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED OR SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS INVOLVED. SO I WOULD ASK THAT YOU YOU BEGIN THE PROCESS RATHER QUICKLY. TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT WE IMPOSE. FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO SECURE LICENSURE IN THE BARBERING AND COSMETOLOGY AREA HOWEVER THAT'S BROKEN DOWN. TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE ARE REQUIRING IS A STATE IS IN FACT NOT A BARRIER TO EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE FOR MANY PEOPLE. THIS IS AN ENTRY LEVEL OCCUPATION AN OCCUPATION WHERE ONCE THEY SECURE. A LICENSE. CAN BE A MEANS TO PROVIDE A LIVING FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND IF WE'RE PUTTING OBSTACLES IN FRONT OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS IF WE ARE. IMPOSING AT EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT CARRY A COST THAT'S DIFFICULT TO PAY BACK. THAT IS COMPLETELY CONTRARY CERTAINLY TO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN AND I SUSPECT IF WE AS MY COLLEAGUES IN THIS CHAMBER AND THOSE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY. MANY OF THEM IF NOT MOST OR ALL OF THE MAY AGREE SO I'D LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS I PLAN TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE STUDY THAT WAS DONE. APPARENTLY SOME TIME AGO TO SUPPORT THERETENTION OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN HUNDRED OUR- A REQUIREMENT TO SEE HOW RIGOROUS. PROCEDURES THAT- THAT WENT OUT OF VOGUE IN NINETEEN FORTY YEAR IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE- THE FIRST TRAINING ON CHEMICALS THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN USED OR IN FACT MAY BE PROHIBITED. FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS AND WE NEED TO REVISE OUR TRAINING PROGRAM SO I'M CONFIDENT THAT YOU AND THE BOARD WILL DO THAT. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU BECAUSE- IT'S CLEAR THAT THE TRAINING IS NOT ALL HEALTH AND SAFETY RELATED. AND IT'S PROBABLY CLEAR THE- BARBERING AND COSMETOLOGY IS NOT ANY LESS SAFE IN VERMONT TEXAS- ROME ROAD ISLAND OR NEW YORK THAN IT IS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE ANY LESS SAFE YEARS SO I AM GOING TO STOP MY REMARKS AT THIS TIME AND JUST GO BACK TO THE- RIGHT PLACE TO MENTION ONE THING THAT. I THINK UP TO LOOK AT THIS ALSO WE'RE WE'RE IN AGREEMENT WITH YOU ON THAT COMPLETELY AND THE BOARD IS CONCEPTUALLY PRE APPROVED RECENTLY THE MOVING TO A HAIR STYLIST ONLY LICENSED. AND IT'S- SHOWING THAT WHEN WE MOVED TO THAT AREA WE CAN CUT DOWN THE AMOUNT OF EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS IF THEY'RE ONLY INVOLVEMENT AS METROLOGY PERSPECTIVE FROM MATT HAIRSTYLIST SONG SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVES LIKE YOU ARE IN THIS AREA THAT COULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE IN OUR PROFESSION. AND UP WITH A LOT MORE LIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY. THANK YOU BECAUSE WHAT I DIDN'T SAY BUT I HOPE WAS IMPLICIT IN MY COMMENTS IS AND FRANKLY IN SOME AREAS PERHAPS NOT THIS ONE I THINK WE OVER LICENSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE SHOULD LEAN. AWAY FROM THE WERE PUT. AND CERTAINLY WHERE WE- MAKE SURE THAT THE TRAINING IN THE LICENSURE IS LIMITED INC AND THEN TARGETED. TO HEALTH AND SAFETY AND PROFICIENCY- AND CERTAINLY NOTHING ELSE. HAVING SAID THAT I SEE SEARCH A LETTER WELL THIS YEAR I JUST WANT TO COMPLIMENT YOU ON BRING IN THESE THESE ITEMS UP BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THE COMMITTEE IS LOOKING AT THAT AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE SCHOOLS. PRIVATE SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH THE MECHANICS ELECTRONICS WHATEVER IT IS IN THE BIG QUESTION A WE ALWAYS HAVE IS THE SCHOOL PROVIDED THE EDUCATION THAT EQUIVALENT TO THE PAY AT THE OTHER END. WHERE WE FIND STUDENTS THAT ARE ARE WITH DEBT THAT THE JOB IS THEIR PAY AND- EIGHT NINE TEN DOLLARS AN HOUR VERSUS THE COST OF HAVING A THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR DEBT REMAINING IN THE SCHOOL SO THAT'S THE- AND ANGLE THAT THAT WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT AND I'M HOPING THAT THE BOARD WILL LOOK AT THAT- THE MEANS. THAT SHOULD JUSTIFY THE ENDS SO CONSEQUENTLY YOUR COMMENTS ARE RIGHT ON AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT YES SOME OF THESE JOBS ARE ENTRY LEVEL SOME OF THE- THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THESE FIELDS- GO OUT TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY REALLY NEED HELP. AND B. AND IF THE COST IS PROHIBITIVE IN THE INCOME IS NOT THERE THEN WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT IT AND IN KEEPING IN MIND OF COURSE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND PROTECTING THE GENERAL PUBLIC. SO LOOKING AT THE CURRICULUM MIGHT BE ABLE SOME WE MIGHT FIND SOME ADJUSTMENTS THERE TO OFFSET THE COST THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER CARILLO PLEASE. TAKE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT CHAIR ROTH AND CENTER DR LET I WOULD YOU WANT TO REAFFIRM- THE COMMENTS THAT. OU MADE- YOU COULD HAVE SAID IT ANY MORE. SPECIFICALLY ON THE CONCERNS SPECIFICALLY ON OVER REGULATION AND LICENSURE OF A COMMENSURATE WITH THE DATA THAT WE'VE SEEN I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT- ACCORDING TO UCLA'S OF CALIFORNIA. HEALTHY NAIL SALON COLLABORATIVE. AND IF- OF OUR MAKE LESS THAN SIX DOLLARS A WEEK A MAJORITY OF INDIVIDUALS ARE. EARNING LESS THAN SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK- IN THIS IN THIS CATEGORY AND THAT'S ALARMING AND THAT. JUST SHOWS THAT THE TO THE POVERTY LEVEL WAGES AND- WHAT'S PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING ALSO IS- DAY- PERCENTAGE OF NAIL SALON WORKERS. THAT ARE CONSISTING OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY MANY OF THEM WOMEN IN FACT I UNDERSTAND THAT A CO CLOSE TO EIGHTY ONE PERCENT. ARE WOMEN WITH RESPECT TO NAIL SALON WORKERS AND FOR THE ONLY ABOUT HALF OF THE WORKERS ARE CONSIDERED. ENGLISH PROFICIENT. SO WITH ALL OF THESE ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO EVEN HATE AND ALL OF THESE. OUTSTANDING ISSUES THE QUESTION THEN IS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF OVER REGULATION AS WELL AS THEY COVERED PANDEMIC ON THE INDUSTRY- IN MOST CASES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ASIAN WOMEN MANY OF THEM IMMIGRANTS OR REFUGEES. AND SO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MANY LICENSEES ARE. IDENTIFIES ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW IDEAL AND YOU KNOW WE DON'T COLLECT THAT INFORMATION. BUT I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN WITH THE BOARD FOR SIXTEEN PLUS YEARS AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT THAT NUMBER THAT YOU MENTIONED JUST PROBABLY HIGHER. AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE CLOSE TO THEM A HUNDRED THOUSAND LICENSED MANICURISTS IN THE STATE. M. AND I WOULD I WOULD VENTURE THAT THE PERCENTAGE THAT ARE. OF ASIAN DESCENT IS HIGHER THAN THAT M. 80% IT WOULD PROBABLY AND PUT IT MORE IN THE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE PERCENT. AND SO IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE'VE TRIED TO INCREASE OUR OUTREACH M. TO THE NON ENGLISH SPEAKING COMMUNITIES M. WE'RE FORTUNATE IT AND WE HAVE HAD SOME GREAT SUCCESS WITH THE VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY. AND WE'VE HAD SOME GREAT PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE HAVE BUILT IN ORDER TO AND GET INFORMATION OUT AND IN IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SO. AND WE WHAT WE DO SO WE DON'T HAVE THAT EXACT DATA BUT BUT MY SENSES WE DO HAVE A VERY HIGH POPULATION. OF AND THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER AND COMMUNITY IN THIS INDUSTRY NOT ONLY IN OUR MANICURIST LICENSING BUT ALSO IN OUR AND- I'M SO SORRY MY POWER. WE HAVE AN ALL KINDS OF TECHNICAL THINGS TODAY I'M SORRY- BUT ALSO AS WELL AS OUR INSTITUTION WITH THEIR SKIN CARE COMMUNITY M. AND SO IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE'VE PUT AT THE TOP OF OUR LIST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE COMMUNICATING WITH THIS- WITH THESE WORKERS AND MAKING SURE THAT THY'RE SAFE AS WELL AS- IN THEIR CLIENT STATES AND I THINK WE'VE- WE'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. IN. IN OUR COMMUNICATIONS WITH THIS AREA. THANK YOU APPRECIATE GALLON THAT IN THE NUMBERS MIGHT BE HIGHER ABOUT NINETY PER. OF CONSISTENT ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER WOMEN AND AGAIN YOU CAN SEE THE VICTIMIZATION CLEARLY AND A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AREAS OR EVEN TO THE ISSUES OF LANGUAGE ACCESS. AS YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK AT DISAGGREGATED DATA TO BEST UNDERSTAND POLICY AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFICS AROUND DATA AND DEMOGRAPHICS IT BECOMES CHALLENGING. FOR US TO DO SO I HOPE THAT YOU'LL WELCOME AND BE OPEN TO THAT OF HELPING TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN. CAN I SOME OF THESE ISSUES. EVEN FOR THE ISSUES OF EXAMINATIONS THAT OFFER IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH HAVE YOU OBSERVED ANY MAJOR DIFFERENCES IN PASSAGE RATES. WE HAVE THEM YOU KNOW ARE WE GIVE OUR EXAMS IN ENGLISH AND IN SPANISH AND VIETNAMESE AND KOREAN AT THAT THE VIETNAMESE AND THE CURRY AND PASS RATES USUALLY ARE VERY- ARE ARE USUALLY HIGHER THAN THE REST AND THE SPANISH PASS RATES REMAINS A CONCERN. FOR OUR BOARD AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT FOR. MANY MANY YEARS AND- I'LL ACTUALLY CARRIED OVER TO MY PORT NUMBER. YES YOU'RE RIGHT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE SPANISH FAST RATES ARE ON OUR WRITTEN EXAM FOR A VERY LONG TIME. AND THE BOARDS TRY TO DO EVERY TYPE OF ANALYTICS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT WE TALKED TO- R. AS WE TALK TO OUR SCHOOLS WE TALKED TO THE STATE OUR- EDUCATIONAL PEOPLE- IN CALIFORNIA TO DETERMINISTIC TESTING PROPER ALL THE PROTOCOLS BEING MET. WE TALK WITH OUR NATIONAL ORGANIZATION ARE WHO ACTUALLY RUNS AND MONITORS THE EXAMINATION WHAT THEIR THOUGHTS WERE WE EVEN BROUGHT IN A COUPLE TECHNICAL PEOPLE THAT THAT ARE- STAFF STAFF THEIR AGENCY. TO TALK TO OUR PORTS AND- WE WILL REALLY COULDN'T FIND A REAL. THERE WERE STILL TO FIND WHY THE SPANISH- THE FAILURE RATES WERE SO HIGH BUT IN LOOKING AT ANOTHER ASPECT. OF SPECIFICALLY OUR PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH WE REVIEWED. OUR APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING AND FOUND IT TO BE. PRETTY INADEQUATE IN A LOT OF AREAS ARE THERE RECEIVING TRAINING FOR ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY HOURS AND THE REST THEIR TIME THEY'RE WORKING AND THE ACTUAL SHOPS AND- WHICH THEY DO FOR TWO YEARS. BUT THEY HAVE TO PASS THE WRITTEN EXAMINATION AT THE END OF THIS AREA. AND THEIR EXAMINATION REYES DISAPPEARS FROM ALL THE PASS RATE IS ONLY IN THE LOW THIRTIES WILL ROLL IN THE PACIFIC AND THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM SO THIS LEADS WE BELIEVE TO OUR LOW STATEWIDE PASS RATE IN THIS AREA. SO WE THOUGHT BY ATTACKING A PROBLEMS THAT WE SAW IN THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM WOULD ALSO HELP RESOLVE OUR LOW PASS RATES ON SPANISH LANGUAGE TESTING. SO OUR BOARD IS REALLY JUST RECENTLY BROUGHT FORTH AND APPROVE OTTE'S FIFTY DIFFERENT RECOMMENDED CHANGES TO THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. THAT WOULD BETTER AMPLIFY OUR NEEDS AND THEIR NEEDS FOR PASSING THIS WRITTEN EXAMINATION AND WE'RE WORKING ON. THAT- DILIGENTLY RIGHT NOW. OKAY THEY GIVE VERY MUCH. ALSO WHICH WAS REFER THE AGAIN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY NAIL SALON COLLABORATIVE- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE POST CODE- BUT ALSO RULING WITH RESPECT TO THAT EIGHT THE XENA PHOBIA STEREOTYPING AND DISCRIMINATION THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION WAS PROVIDING. A TRANSLATED TO COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR BUSINESSES TO SUPPORT THEM IN THE RE OPENING AND THEN SECONDLY COORDINATING AN ISSUE CAMPAIGN TO COUNTER XENOPHOBIA STEREOTYPING DISCRIMINATION AND VIOLENCE AND- THE NAIL SALONS AND THEN THIRDLY TO ENSURE ENSURE THAT STRONG WORKER PROTECTIONS ARE IN PLACE IN THE CONTEXT OF RE OPENING HAS THAT SOMETHING ARE THESE MEASURES ON FRONT AND CENTER. AS WELL ON YOUR WRITER. ABSOLUTELY AND WE'RE MORE THAN WILLING TO WORK WITH AND THE COLLABORATIVE AS WELL AS AND ANYONE FROM THE API CAUCUS AND IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S DEFINITELY A CONCERN OF OURS. WE DEAL WITH SUCH A LARGE VOLUME AND HAVE ACCESS TO SO MANY- LICENSEES THAT ARE AND THAT AND- YOU KNOW THE API AREA AND SO I DEFINITELY THINK. THERE'S A LOT WE COULD DO TO ADD FACILITATE BETTER EDUCATION- WE WOULD WELCOME ANY TYPE OF PARTNERSHIPS IN IN THAT AREA. M. AND T. IN THE IN THE FOREFRONT AND BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH ACCESS TO YOU AND SO MANY INDIVIDUALS AND I THINK IT'S WHERE WE STARTED WITH THEM HOLDING OUR OWN AND VIRTUAL EVENTS- AS MR WEEKES MENTIONED IN HIS OPENING STATEMENT. JUST HELD ON ON TUESDAY AND EVENT FOR OUR VIETNAMESE LICENSEES I'M WITH OUR VIETNAMESE STAFF SO THE VIRTUAL EVENT WHAT WAS DONE IN IN THAT LANGUAGE AND WE WERE ABLE TO HELP THEM ANSWER. QUESTIONS AND GIVE IT QUEUE IN A WHICH AND WE HOPE IS I'M GOING TO BE HELPFUL AND WE ARE LOOKING TO DO MORE OF THAT TYPE OF WORK AND IN THE FUTURE AND- WE HAVE TRANSLATED ALL OF OUR INFORMATION AND FROM OUR BOARD AND WE HAVE OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS TRANSLATED AGAIN. M. ENGLISH VIETNAMESE SPANISH AND- CREAN BUT WE'VE ALSO ADDED PERCY ARABIC AND- SIMPLIFIED INTERESTED TRADITIONAL CHINESE JUST SO WE CAN TRY TO REACH M. AS MANY OF OUR LICENSEES AS POSSIBLE WE'RE LOOKING EVEN AT FURTHER LANGUAGES AND THAT FOR OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS WHICH IS. HOW THEY SHOULD BE OPERATING IN THEIR IN THEIR SALON SO WE'RE REALLY LOOKING. TO TRY TO MAKE THAT AVAILABLE NâNG. GREAT THEN- JUST OF THE LAST IS COMMON FOR CLAY FOR. IT WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT AS IN THIS IS THAT THE AVERAGE WE- IS SIX HUNDRED. A WEEK FOR A WORKER OF LICENSING AND NAIL SALON. M. I. A. I AM NOT I WOULDN'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION ON THAT AT ALL IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE'VE EVER COLLECTED DATA ON IT ALSO I ACTUALLY DON'T I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT. I'M SORRY YOU DON'T HAVE DATA ON THE AVERAGE WAGE FOR A LICENSEE IN A NAIL SALON. WE DO NOT. DID YOU DO YOU HAVE. DATA OR STATISTICS AS TO THE AVERAGE WAGE FOR THE LICENSEES IN GENERAL. WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE OF THE WAGE STATISTICS I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE COULD PROBABLY GAIN FOR YOU FROM FROM OTHER AGENCIES BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT ARTWORK OKAY SOMETHING THAT THE BOARD COLLECTS BUT DOES THAT SOUND REASONABLE IF OF THAT THE PACKETS OF INFORMATION FROM THE UCLA LA LABOR CENTER- SHOWS THAT APPROXIMATELY THAT'S THE AVERAGE AMOUNT. COMES OUT TO THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE THOUSAND ABOUT RIGHT YES OKAY SO THIRTY WITH THIRTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A LICENSEE- AND THEN BE A TO THE EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS IF THE AVERAGE COSTS ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS AT A PRIVATE SCHOOL. CRITICS FIVE I JUST. BUT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THIS DOESN'T SETTLE WELL WITH ME OR I THINK ANYONE FRANKLY- THAT THAT IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. AND SO. IF I SEE YOU SHAKING YOUR HEAD. DID DOES THIS RISE TO THE LEVEL OF SENSE OF URGENCY UNDERSTANDING THAT. THERE ARE. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE WORKING HARD WORKING SEVEN DAYS A WEEK TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE AND YET THEY STILL CANNOT ATTEND THE CALIFORNIA AMERICAN DREAM. JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE DOES THIS RISE TO THE LEVEL OF URGENCY FOR THIS SUBSTANTIVE REFORMS IN THIS AREA. UPSIDE I THINK IT ABSOLUTELY RISES TO THE LEVEL OF URGENCY. MY PHONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU TO OUR LOW- FIRST ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN FOLLOWED BY SENATOR ARCHULETA. THANK YOU AND- I I'M JUST GONNA BE REPEATING WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID. THIS IS THIS REALLY IS ABOUT OVER REGULATION- AND WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE SUCH HIGH BARRIERS TO ENTRY FOR. JOBS THAT- THAT DON'T NEED IT IN A BIT DAY EXAMPLE I WOULD GIVE IS- DRYING SALONS WHY WOULD THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH- TRAINING IN HAIR DYING AND FACIALS AND NAILS AND IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE HAPPEN OVERALL LICENSE LIKE THAT AND I THINK YOU REALLY DO NEED TO LOOK AT HEARING. BUT SO I JUST WANT TO ADD MY VOICE TO THAT CHORUS BUT- I WANTED TO KNOW ALSO AND- WHAT YOU'RE DOING ABOUT THIS EVOLVING NATURE OF WORK- A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SEEKING A BEAUTIFICATION OUTSIDE OF BRICK WALLS THE- BRICK AND MORTAR OPERATIONS. YOU KNOW PEOPLE WANT- STYLISTS COME INTO THEIR HAIR FOR WEDDINGS AND- I. UNDERSTAND THAT IT REQUIRES A PERSONAL SERVICES PERMIT. AND THAT THE BOARD WAS TASKED TO ESTABLISH IT. TO START TO LOOK AT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO ESTABLISH IT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. SO JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE PROGRESS ON THAT. BECAUSE OF I THINK THIS IS A VERY. IMPORTANT FOR ME TO GET IN PLACE. THANK YOU YES WE'VE WE'VE WORKED FOR QUITE SOME TIME ON OUR PERSONAL SERVICE PERMIT AND THAT REGULATION PACKAGE HAS BEEN FILED WITH THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. THEY HAD SOME MODIFICATIONS TO IT AND SO WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF. FINALIZING THAT THERE AND CHANGES TO IT M. AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THOSE SHOULD BE APPROVED I WOULD I AM LEAVE WTHIN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS. AND THEN WE WILL BE READY TO GO WE ALREADY WORK WITH DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS TO M. START. THE PREPARATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THAT SO THAT AS SOON AS OUR REGULATIONS ARE FINALLY APPROVED WE'RE READY TO GO AND START ISSUING THOSE LICENSES. SO HOW MUCH WOULD SOMETHING LIKE THAT COST BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE KIND OF YOU'RE GONNA END UP. IN A SITUATION THAT IT IS THERE'S A REALLY HIGH BARRIER TO ATTAINING THIS- THIS PERMIT THAT PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO APPLY FOR IT AND JUST GO AHEAD WITH STILL DOING THERE AT. NO THERE. PLYING THEIR TRADE OUTSIDE OF THESE BRICK MORTAR OPERATIONS THIS CAN BE A REASONABLE PERMIT TO OBTAIN I BELIEVE IT'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN I PROGRAM TWENTY DOLLAR FEE FOR THAT THAT LICENSE OKAY GREAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THOSE OF THOSE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS CENTER CHILLA YES I THANK YOU MR I'D LIKE TO GET BACK TO THE- THE PASSING RATE- WE JUST HEARD THAT THE- THOSE WHO DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH- TO THE DEGREE THAT- I GUESS MOST OF US DO BUT- HAVE DIFFICULTY IN AND PASSED IN THE FINAL EXAM AND SO CONSEQUENTLY THE MONEY THAT. THEY PUT ON THE TABLE FOR THE NUMBER OF HOURS THEY WENT THAT THE PERHAPS THE SCHOOLS WEREN'T GIVING THEM THE TUTORING BRINGING IN BILINGUAL EDUCATION PER SE. IN IN SOME WAY PREPARING THE STUDENTS TO SUCCEED RATHER THAN JUST TO HAVE THESE SCHOOLS- TAKE IN THE TUITION MONEY AND NOT LOOK AT THE AT THE END RESULT. AS THE CULTURE I JUST MENTIONED THAT AGAIN THE IS THE MEANS MAY NOT JUSTIFY THE AND AS I SAID EARLIER FINANCIALLY. AND SO IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SCHOOLS THERE AND IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS REQUIRED THAT I THINK THEY SHOULD ALSO LOOK INTO HAVING- INSTRUCTORS THAT ARE PROFICIENT IN BOTH LANGUAGES OR WHATEVER LANGUAGE YOU MIGHT BE. TO HELP THE STUDENTS TO PASS IF THEY COULD JUST LOOK INTO THAT AND- PERHAPS- IMPLEMENTED PLAN- THAT WOULD HELP BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE STUDENTS BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PASSING RATE. THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR THE COST THAT THEY THEY'VE THEY PUT ON THE TABLE. THE AND I THINK THAT'S A SUGGESTION I'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY TAKE A LOOK AT. AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS DATA WE THE CULTURED MENTION DATA AND INFORMATION WITH SO MANY OTHER SCHOOLS I'D MENTION THEY HAVE THAT DATA IN IT JUST TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH. RECOMMENDATION I'D LIKE TO HAVE THEM TAKE A GOOD STRONG LOOK AT THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR. SENATOR CHOI VOTE. CENTER YOU ARE ON. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO- JEFF DRESS- AT. MY COLLEAGUES AND OUR WITNESSES HERE TODAY JUST A QUICK QUESTION- IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT THAT WE FIND OURSELVES WITH THE- ECONOMIC SETBACKS WE CHAT WITH COLBERT NINETEEN- IT MOVING FORWARD OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE OR WHAT IS THE TIME FRAME THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AT WITH REGARDS TO THE STREAMLINING AB- DEBILITY TO RECEIVE THESE LICENSES AND- BE HAVING PEOPLE BE ABLE. TO WORK AND- AND TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES. IT THANK YOU AND DO YOU DO YOU MEAN PEOPLE THAT HAVE ALREADY GONE TO SCHOOL. I'M REFERRING TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF SIXTEEN HOURS PER HAS BEEN RECONSIDERED TO- A LESSER AMOUNT OF HOURS. EXCELLENT SO. GO AHEAD PLEASE SO IT WOULD IT WOULD OBVIOUSLY WE WOULDN'T WE WOULD NEED THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY AND TO MAKE THAT CHANGE. AND I'M SORRY I'M A FRESHMAN SENATOR WOULD YOU MIND EXPLAINING EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. SURE SO ONE OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW WITH WITH THAT WITH THE SENSE THAT PROCESS I THINK THAT'S- SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH BOTH THE COMMITTEES AND GETTING THAT LANGUAGE. I AM SHOULD THERE BE IT A REDUCTION IN THE IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT THROUGH THAT THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN THE BILL. AND AS A RESULT OF THIS HEARING AND THEN MOVE FORWARD FROM THERE AND THEN HE WOULD BE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW POSSIBLY JANUARY. OF NEXT YEAR FOR AN IMPLEMENTATION M. OF COURSE THERE WILL BE A LOT AND SHOULD THE HOURS BE REDUCED THAT WOULD BE AND YOU KNOW A PROCESS WE WOULD HAVE TO WORK THROUGH WITH SCHOOLS. AND TO DETERMINE HOW THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN WHERE STUDENTS ARE. THAT THE BY READING COSMETOLOGY SCHOOLS AM. TRADITIONALLY RAN ALL THE TIME SO WE IN OUR BOARD WE DON'T HAVE. A CERTAIN TIME OF YEAR WHERE WE SEE A LOT OF GRADUATION DATE THE GRADUATIONS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME BECAUSE ENROLLMENT IS FAIRLY CONTINUOUS SO. AND IT WOULD JUST TAKE THEM SOME FINESSE IT WORKING WITH THE SCHOOLS TO DETERMINE HOW TO IMPLEMENT THAT BUT WE WOULD DEFINITELY START THIS PROCESS AND IN WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEES AND THE STAFF TO DETERMINE. WHAT THOSE HOURS SHOULD BE SHOULD. THERE END UP BEING A REDUCTION. THANK YOU AND WOULD YOU MIND ADAM. JUST BEING GOING A LITTLE FURTHER IN CLARIFICATION AS FAR AS WHICH COMMITTEES YOU'RE REFERRING TO WOULD BEINVOLVED IN THE AN INTERESTING THIS TOPIC. WE WOULD WORK WITH THE ASSEMBLY BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS AS WELL AS THE SENATE BUSINESS PROFESSIONS. OKAY AND THEN WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH STATUTES IN ORDER IS A BIT PASS A BILL BASICALLY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT CORRECT. OKAY WONDERFUL- THANK YOU THAT'S ALL FOR ME. THANK YOU. I DO I THOUGHT THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT QUESTION MA'AM AND I GUESS. LET ME JUST ASK IT IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY YOU ALL HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING I GUESS WITH THIS. EDUCATION REQUIREMENT AND HOW MANY HOURS I THINK THERE WAS A STUDY THAT WAS DONE A FEW YEARS AGO. SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO PUT IT IN A BILL IF WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THE NUMBER OF HOURS SAID BERBERS IN BURR RIDGE TO BE IN COSMETOLOGIST TO BE THE DEBATE IN ORDER TO SECURE LICENSURE HOW LONG IS IT GOING TO TAKE YOU AND YOUR BOARD TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW MANY HOURS NEED TO BE IN THE CURRICULUM FOR A BARBER OR COSMETOLOGIST OR ANY OF THE CATEGORIES THAT FIT IN THERE- IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. WAIT I THINK IT. SINCE I'VE BEEN WITH THE BOARD THERE ARE MAYBE ONE RIGHT BEFORE I BECAME TO THE BOARD THEY REVIEWED THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED OUR CURRICULUM AND THEN. AS YOU MENTIONED I'M JUST A FEW YEARS BACK. AND BOTH TIMES THAT THE RECOMMENDATION WAS TO MAINTAIN THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS- I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY I NEED- THAT THE TIMES HAVE CHANGED I THINK THIS IS. A NATIONAL DISCUSSION THAT'S HAPPENED I PERSONALLY HAD HAD NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL. THAT THIS IS- SOMETHING THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT IN A WAY. M. NOT SO MUCH OF HOW WE CAN REDUCE BUT WHAT WHAT SHOULD THE HOURS BEFORE A COSMETOLOGIST SO I THINK. THE BOARD THAT M. MICHAEL MY CURRENT BOARD AND I THINK IS VERY OPEN TO THIS I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT- WE SEE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A DIFFERENT LOOK AT THIS AND TRYING TO DO. NOT JUST MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO JUST FOR THE SAKE OF. MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO BUT REALLY LOOK AT. THE RISKS INVOLVED IN THE IN THE SERVICES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE SCOPE OF PRACTICES. AND DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY M. AND WHAT TYPE OF RISKY GOES TO THE CONSUMER AND THAT SHE NEEDS TO BE OUR FOCUS FOR DEVELOPING CURRICULUM. WILL SINCE YOU WILL HAVE DONE THIS A FEW TIMES AND SINCE YOU'VE BEEN THERE FOR. A FEW YEARS- DO YOU THINK THIS ROUTE THIS REVIEW THIS INTERNAL REVIEW BY YOU AND YOUR BOARD. CAN BE COMPLETED IN A YEAR. ABSOLUTELY OKAY BECAUSE THAT'LL BE VERY HELPFUL TO US IN DECIDING WHAT WE DO. IN THESE COMMITTEES WITH RESPECT TO SUNSET REVIEW SO THE- REVIEW OF THE- CURRICULUM THE CURRICULA- FOR THESE VARIOUS THESE OCCUPATIONS- COULD BE COMPLETED WITHIN CERTAINLY WITHIN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD AND WE CAN HAVE A DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT THE- WHAT THE NEW IF THERE IS A NEW- EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENT IS FOR BARBERING AND COSMETOLOGY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE DEFINITELY AGREE OKAY PERFECT- AND I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR SENATOR RITUAL BOOK FOR ASKING THAT QUESTION VERY VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION COLLEAGUES ANY FURTHER.

GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS WENDY COCHRAN AND ON THE CALIFORNIA LICENSE APPLICATION FOUNDER OF CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION APPLICATION ADVOCACY AND CALIFORNIA STATIC ALLIANCE I REPRESENTS OVER NINETY THOUSAND LICENSED CALIFORNIA SITUATIONS THE LARGEST PROPHETIC MARKETS IN THE COUNTRY. SOME OF YOUR HEARING TODAY HAD CAREERS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. I'M ASKING YOU TO TAKE A MOMENT TO RECALL AND COMPARE WHAT YOU WERE DOING THAT AND HOW YOUR PROFESSION IS INVOLVED BECAUSE OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY. CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING LOCKLEY CONSTRAINS TO WORKING WITH THE ROLODEX A TYPEWRITER AND IT'S JUST NOT THAT THERE'S NO PAT AND THE TOOLS OF YOUR TRADE NOW IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. CALIFORNIA LICENSE APPLICATIONS NOT HOW TO RESELL ABBREVIATION IT'S GOT THE PRACTICES NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. FORTY THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THE LICENSE OF THE REGIONAL CREATED. ONE SIDE WITH NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THE DISTRICT OUT HERE IN NAIL CARE SERVICES AND CREATED A NEW CLASSIFICATION OF LIFE COMPETING PROFESSIONAL. AS THE YEARS PROGRESSED NEVER HAD CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE REVIEWED HOW ARE INDUSTRIES CHANGE ANY POLITICALLY TO POLICY THE KEEPING UP WITH THE INDUSTRY TRENDS THE RESULT. COMMANDEER THE SERVICES BEING STATEMENT PERFORMED ACROSS THE COUNTRY BY INSTITUTIONS ARE ACTUALLY ILLEGAL. FOR US TO PERFORM HERE IN CALIFORNIA. PLEASE ALLOW THE TO READ AND DETERMINE SERVICES CAN SAFELY BE PROVIDE BY THEIR LICENSEES BASED ON INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES AND CONSUMER SAFETY. PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY THE BBC IS CONSUMER SAFETY. UPDATED STATUTORY LANGUAGE THE BURDEN F KEEPING UP WITH CONSUMER TRENDS CAN BE SHIFTED TO A MORE NIMBLE ET SHE ALLOWING THEM TO BUILD AND MODIFY THE REGULATIONS AROUND WHAT THEY CAN'T ENFORCE. WE ALSO ARE AKING FOR A TRANSFER OF PRIMARY OVERSIGHT AND THE BEAUTY SCHOOLS OVER TO THE BBC. PRIVATE MEETINGS FOR SPEND MORE TIME TEACHING THEIR STUDENTS HOW TO RUN SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS THAN THEY DO TEACHING THEIR STUDENTS THE REGULATIONS THAT GOVERN THEIR PROFESSIONAL LICENSES. UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE TPP UNDER QUALIFIED OFTEN UNLICENSED AND NEWLY LICENSED INSTRUCTORS ARE LEADING STUDENTS. INCIDENTS OF STUDENTS BEING TAUGHT OUT OF STILL PRACTICES FOR HOW TO USE LOOPHOLES AND GREY AREAS IS NOT UNCOMMON. DISTRACTED SET UP STUDENTS FOR POTENTIALLY COSTLY FINES PENALTIES AGAINST THEIR PROFESSIONAL LICENSE AND CONSUMER HARM. EVEN HE LEADING THE SCHOOL THESE PRACTICES CAN BE STOPPED AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION REGULATIONS CAN'T BE EMPHASIZED NOT MINUTE. DELETED AND CIRCUMVENTED. EARLIER GENERAL ROCK. AT CERTIFICATION HAVE MEETING. YEAH DOES NOT REQUIRE BABY HE CONTINUED EDUCATION AND IT SHOULD NORTHERN CALIFORNIA KNOWLEDGE ADVANCED CERTIFICATION TO DEMONSTRATE COMPETENCY SAFETY AND PROFESSIONAL ADVANCEMENT OF THE UNIVERSE BEAUTY PROFESSIONAL LICENSING. SENATOR BATES ALSO NOTED THAT WE HAVE A BACKLOG OF GRADUATES THAT IT WAITED ALMOST TWO YEARS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THEIR LICENSING EXAM. WE WOULD ASK THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME SORT OF ASSISTANCE. IF THE SPENDING THE PRACTICAL EXAMINATION UNDER AN EMERGENCY ORDER IN ORDER FOR THOSE PEOPLE TO PASS THEIR EXAMINATIONS INTO WRITTEN FORMAT AND MOVE ON TO. THE COMING THE LICENSE KEYS THAT WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE COMPETENTLY TRAINED IN THE SCHOOL OF. CALIFORNIA'S MEDICAL LIFE ALSO SUPPORTS EIGHTY TWO THIRTY ONE WE BELIEVE IN EQUAL TREATMENT OF ALL LICENSE PLATE UNDER THE BBC. SUPPORTING EIGHTY TWO THIRTY ONE. FROM WIN WILL ALLOW LICENSE MANAGER THE OPTION TO DO FRENCH ACCORDING TO EIGHTY FIVE MANAGERS HVE BEEN SINGLED OUT I WILL DO THIS EXEMPTION WITHOUT YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND TIME. OUR WORK IS WORKING WITH YOU OFF THE CHANGE. THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. HELLO LINE FIFTEEN ONE FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU SENATOR ROB ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW AND MEMBERS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE MY NAME IS FRED JONES AND FOR THE LAST TWENTY ONE YEARS I HAVE. GIVEN VOICE TO THE BEAUTY AND BARBERING INDUSTRY AS A REGISTERED LOBBYIST AND LEGAL COUNSEL FOR THE PROFESSIONAL BEAUTY FEDERATION CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO COMMEND STAFF FOR THEIR COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND REPORT- WE DO HAVE SOME% ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES- THE STAFF THE STAFF RECOMMENDED IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING SOME OF THE BARRIERS OF ENTRY CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN PLACED BY SEVERAL- COMMITTEE MEMBERS INCLUDING NEW CHAIRMAN LAW- I. LIKE TO NOTE THAT THERE ARE OVER SIX HUNDRED SIXTEEN THOUSAND ACTIVE LICENSEES IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE LICENSED BY OUR STATE BOARD OF BARBERING COSMETOLOGY THAT'S- OVER 2% OF EVERY CALIFORNIA ADULT. SO WHATEVER CLEAR YOU'RE SAYING A. B. THEY HAVEN'T HAMPERED QUITE A BIT OF PEOPLE FROM GETTING THIS LICENSE WE ALSO HAVE AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THAT WAS BRIEFLY TOUCHED UPON. AFTER JUST THIRTY NINE HOURS OF FORMAL INSTRUCTION THESE APPRENTICES ARE ALLOWED TO GO TO WORK. AND EARN WHILE THEY LEARN IN A BARBER SHOP OR SALON SETTING. SO THERE ARE OTHER MEANS OF ENTRY INTO THIS INDUSTRY OTHER THAN JUST THE FORMAL EDUCATION ROUTE. HOWEVER THE VAST VAST MAJORITY OF OUR LICENSE USE CHOSE THE FORMAL EDUCATION ROUTE FOR A LOT OF VERY GOOD REASONS OUR LOW APPRENTICESHIP LICENSING EXAM PASS RATE IS JUST ONE OF MANY. THAT SHOW THAT GOING THROUGH FORMAL EDUCATION SETTING PROVIDES A MUCH BETTER FOUNDATION- FOR MOST OF OUR LICENSEES. WE WOULD LIKE TO. AND REENTER WHAT MISTER WEEKS SAID. CURRENTLY THE COSMETOLOGY LICENSE IS KIND OF THE OVER ARCHING MASTER LICENSE WHICH INCLUDES ALL THREE AREAS HAIR SKIN NAILS. HOWEVER THE STATE BOARD ONLY HAS SUBLICENSE THIS FOR SKIN AND NAILS WHICH ARE CONSIDERABLY LESS HOURS OF COURSE IN COSMETOLOGY. WE BELIEVE THE BOARD SHOULD CREATE A SUBLICENSE FOR THOSE THAT JUST WANT TO DO HAIR HAIRSTYLES LICENSE AND WE THINK THAT COULD BE CONSIDERABLY LESS HOURS THAN THE CURRENT SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS BECAUSE MENTALITY BUT WE ALSO ARE SPONSORING LEGISLATION BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON THIS YEAR. TO DRAMATICALLY EXPAND THE EXTERNSHIP PROGRAM TO ALLOW OUR STUDENTS TO GO TO WORK IN A SALON SETTING SOONER DURING YOUR EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND ACTUALLY RECEIVED HEY FOR SUCH. A. ONE ON THE JOB EXPERIENCE. WE ALSO ARE- OPEN TO THE AND WOULD LIKE TO. AS YOU CRAFT. HUGER ABLE WINDING OF CLOCKTOWER CREDIT AND COMPETENCY CERTIFICATION. SO THAT MAYBE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND THEORETICAL INSTRUCTION CAN HAVE MINIMUM CLOCK HOURS ASSIGNED TO STATUTORILY. THE SCHOOLS ARE ABLE TO CERTIFY BE ON. HANDS ON PRACTICAL COMPETENCIES BEYOND THOSE MINIMUM CLOCKTOWER- THEORETICAL INSTRUCTION. I WILL ALSO SAY- IN RESPONSE TO SOME MEMBERS CONCERNED ESPECIALLY CHAIRMAN- LOS CONCERNED ABOUT HEY. THIS IS AN ALL CASH INDUSTRY AND UNFORTUNATELY UNDER REPORTING INCOME IS RAMPANT IT'S ALMOST. NOBODY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD WORK FOR SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS AN HOUR ESPECIALLY FOR A PHYSICALLY RIGOROUS CAREER OF LIKE MANIC JERRY AND BELIEVE ME NOBODY DOES. THEY TOLD REPORTERS THERE CASH SERVICE INCOME AND ACCIDENT FORTUNATE BECAUSE IT CREATES CONVERSATIONS WITH POLICY MAKERS AND REGULATORS LIKE WE'VE BEEN HAVING TODAY. I WILL ALSO SAY IN THOSE STATES THAT HAVE LASSEN SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS. THEY ALSO HAVE A MUCH MORE FAVORABLE THE EMPLOYEE EMPLOYEES- CLIENT AND SO THEY HAVE MORE EMPLOYER BASED SALONS. CALIFORNIA WELL OVER THREE QUARTERS OF OUR SALONS HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM THE EMPLOYER RELATIONSHIP INTO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR RELATIONSHIP. OR WHAT WE CALL TO THE CORRECT. AND THOSE RENTAL ESTá OWNERS ARE NOT. TO ADD TO IT WITH ANY TYPE OF TRAINING THANK NOT REQUIRED CAN YOU PROVIDE IT WHEREAS IN THE STATES HAVE MORE FAVOR EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIPS LABOR LAWS. DO PROVIDE AND AUGMENTS THEIR EDUCATION WHEN THEY COME OUT OF SCHOOLS WITH LESS HOURS WE ARE CONCERNED IF YOU CUT BACK HOURS ARBITRARILY. AND IF YOU DO WAY WITH THE PRACTICAL EXAM AS A STAFF REPORT RECOMMENDS. YOU WILL BE PROVIDED LICENSES TO PEOPLE THAT DO NOT HAVE THE PRACTICAL HANDS ON COMPETENCIES THIS IS A VERY TACTILE TEXTURES INDUSTRY. EVERYTHING THAT A STUDENT DOES IN A SCHOOL SETTING WHETHER IT'S IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER LEARNING LEARNING THEORY. OR HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES FOR ACTUALLY DOING SERVICES WITH THEIR HANDS EVERYTHING THEY'RE DOING IS HEALTH AND SAFETY PASSED THE POINT OF SCHOOL SERVES TO CHEAPEN HOUSING REALISTICALLY. OPERATE YES- I'M A VERY TALL AFTER I'M A VERY TALLER SUGAR. THE MOST TOLERANT IN THE ENTIRE. LEGISLATURE AND YOU ARE TESTING MY ABILITY TO BE TOLERANT HERE IN PUBLIC COMMENT SO I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO CONSIDER ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS AND IN AS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU WISH TO PROVIDE IN WRITING.
