YES GOOD MORNING WELCOME THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. MORNING HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THE IMPERIAL COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO SHARE. A FEW WORDS IMPERIAL COUNTY AS YOU MAY KNOW IS A CHRONICALLY DISADVANTAGED UNDERSERVED AND UNDER FUNDED COMMUNITY. IT'S NO SECRET THAT PRIOR TO THIS PANDEMIC THE COUNTY WAS ALREADY IN DIRE NEED FOR RESOURCES. ONLY NINETEEN JUST CAME ALONG TO AGGRAVATE IT SITUATION. TODAY WE HAVE STATE AND NATIONAL ATTENTION ATTENTION WE WISH IT WAS FOR REASONS OTHER THAN TO DISCUSS THE GRIEF SITUATION OUR COMMUNITY IS IN. IT IS IRONIC THOUGH THAT I STILL AWFULLY GRATEFUL THAT SUCH ATTENTION IS BEING PLACED IN THIS COMMUNITY NOW. THERE IS CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION AND CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT THE SEVERITY OF KOBE NINETEEN AND IMPERIAL COUNTY. OF THE THIRTY THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TESTS HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED OVER SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED HAVE BEEN POSITIVE. THAT MAY NOT FOUND THE NEXT SIGNIFICANT TO MANY BUT ONE OF THE COUNTY OF. AN ESTIMATED POPULATION OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND IT IS THE POTENTIAL. OUR CASE RATE PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION IS AT SIX NINETY SIX OVER THE LAST FOURTEEN NAY. ALMOST THREE TIMES AS MUCH OF LOS ANGELES. COUNTY WITH A POPULATION OF TEN MILLION. IN JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS OVER FIVE HUNDRED PATIENTS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED OUT OF IMPERIAL COUNTY AND OTHER CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL. COURSE CONCERNING SITUATION. LIKE EVERY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO PRESERVING THE SAFETY OF OUR RESIDENTS. CONSEQUENTLY WE HAVE TAKEN A VERY DELIVERED IT AND A CAUTIOUS APPROACH AND HOW WE COMBAT THE DISEASE. ALTHOUGH IMPERIAL COUNTY HAS NEVER MOVED FURTHER INTO HIGHER RISK STAGE TAKING ADDITIONAL AND MORE AGGRESSIVE THAT. HELP STOP THE SPREAD OF SPREAD OF KOBE NINETEEN AND THE COMMUNITY. TO BE CLEAR THEY ARE HOME AND FACE COVERING ORDER HAVE BEEN AND REMAIN IN PLACE AND IMPERIAL COUNTY. WE CONTINUE TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF TRADE COVERING SOCIAL DISTRICTING AND OTHER PREVENTION MEASURES. TO DATE IMPERIAL COUNTY HAVE IMPLEMENTED ALL STATE GUIDELINES AND HEALTH OFFICER ORDERS ADDITIONALLY. COUNTY HAVE TAKEN A VERY CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO RE OPENING OF THE TALISMAN AND BUSINESSES WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM SO THAT PROPER SAFEGUARDS ARE IN PLACE. AT THIS TIME NINE AROUND RESTAURANTS BARS PERSONAL CARE SERVICES AND ALL OTHER HIGHER RISK WORKPLACES REMAIN CLOSE. NOT A LOGICAL QUESTION IS WHAT IS COSTING THE THIRDS OF CASES AND HOSPITALIZATIONS IN OUR COUNTY. NO ANSWER THAT ITS FIRST IMPORTANT TO SHARE THAT IMPERIAL COUNTY IS LARGELY INVISIBLE AND FORGOTTEN AS THE REGION UNLIKE MORE WELL KNOWN AND WELL PUBLICISED REGION BUDGET SAN DIEGO. ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO PEOPLE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT OUR COUNTY. COUNTY IS A RURAL COMMUNITY BORDERED BY TO CALIFORNIA COUNTY SAN DIEGO AND RIVERSIDE YUMA ARIZONA IN MAY HE GOT A MEDICAL. THE TO ITS UNIQUE LOCATION IMPERIAL COUNTY IS THE MAJOR CORRIDOR FOR TRANSPORT TO MANY AREAS OF THE UNITED STATES. AGRICULTURE IS AN IMPORTANT. PART OF THE COUNTY TO CONNIE ALTERNATING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF VEGETABLES. ECONOMIC CROPS AND LIVESTOCK FEED THE NATION. COUNTY IS HOME TO CALIPATRIA AND SPENT THE NIGHT LEFT THE PRISON HERBERT HUGHES CORRECTIONAL CENTER AND EL CENTRO NAVAL AIR FACILITY.

BURIAL FAN DEALINGS RECREATIONAL AREA BETTER KNOWN AS GLAMIS SUPPORTS MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE MILLION VEHICLES. AND THE OPEN FIELD WELL- STATE VEHICLE A RECREATIONAL AREA OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND VEHICLES AND A YEAR. ALL IN ALL AT TIMES% DOUBLING POPULATION AND IMPERIAL COUNTY. WITHOUT A DOUBT. COUNTY THE HIGHLY MOBILE POPULATION EVEN WITH INTERNATIONAL CROPPING RESTRICTIONS OVER TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE STILL CROSSING THE INTERNATIONAL BORDER FROM HE KILEY INTO CALEXICO ON A DAILY BASIS FOR WORK HEALTH CARE AND OTHER BUSINESS. CHILD WAS JUST NOT ONE WAY. COUNTY RESIDENTS THE HEALTH CARE SHOP AND VISIT FAMILY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BORDER. THIS LAST WEEKEND IT WAS REPORTED THAT LINE TO CROSS INTO MEXICO WERE MILD LONG WITH WAIT TIMES OF UP TO SEVEN HOURS. THIS IS MAINLY DUE TO SCREENING PROTOCOLS THAT MEXICAN OFFICIALS HAD IMPLEMENTED FOR THE WEEKEND. ADDITIONALLY AS NEIGHBORING COUNTIES BUT JUST SAN DIEGO RIVERSIDE IN YUMA. WILL BE RE OPENING STAGES AND MODIFY THEIR SPARE HOME ORDERS. TRAVEL WILL LIKELY INCREASE NOT ONLY THROUGH OUR COUNTY BUT ALSO WITHIN THEIR- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHILE IMPERIAL COUNTY HAS HAD RELATIVELY LARGE OUTBREAKS IN CONGREGATE SETTING. AND SOME WORKPLACES MOST OF ITS CASES DO NOT FALL INTO THE BEDDING. ANY OF THE KOBE NINETEEN POSITIVE CASES ARE MADE UP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ON OUR UNEMPLOYED. DISABLED RETIRED HOMEMAKERS AND YOUNGER AND OLDER STUDENTS. SOME OF THE DYNAMICS THAT ARE THOUGHT TO BE INFLUENCING THE SPREAD OF KOBE NINETEEN ARE TIED TO CULTURE WHAT I GENERATIONAL FAMILIES AND FACTIONS WITHIN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD. PERSONAL AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOR. AND THE CON COMMENT AND GOING ACROSS THE BOARD. BUT IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS IMPERIAL COUNTY HAS RECEIVED MUCH NEEDED SUPPORT FROM ITS STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS. IN A PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT INCLUDING AND NINETY FIVE.

THANK YOU FOR THAT I'M NOT SPECIFICALLY AWARE OF- THE PROVISION THAT YOU SAID WAS- INSTITUTED MEXICO CERTAINLY FOLLOW UP ON THAT- WE WERE AWARE THAT THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE IN SOUTHBOUND TRAFFIC AS OF LATE TRAVELING BACK INTO MEXICO- WHICH LIKELY IS A RELATED TO- SCREENING THAT THEY MAY BE DOING- AS FOLKS ARE HEADED BACK INTO MEXICO BUT- CERTAINLY THERE'S A NUMBER OF. FACTORS WITH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMPERIAL COUNTY IN MEXICALI WITH PEOPLE LIVING AND WORKING IN AND- AND- HAVING AN ESSENTIAL NEED TO TRAVEL BACK AND FORTH- SO CERTAINLY ADDS COMPLEXITY. TO THE CHALLENGE. WELL I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK INTO THAT BECAUSE THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF INCREASE INFECTIONS AND. AND TO OPEN UP A LINE OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE GOVERNOR BUCK CALIFORNIA. TO DISCUSS THAT PARTICULAR TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY CORRELATION WITH THAT THANK YOU IF THERE ARE ANY MEMBERS THAT THEY THEY HAVE TO LEAVE SO- WOULD IT BE GOOD TO ASK QUESTIONS NOW WE HAVE DOCTOR PAN. THANK YOU- THANK YOU CHAIR AND- AGAIN WHAT I THINK- SHARES OF BOTH OF OUR SOUL- COMMITTEES HERE TODAY FOR BRING US TOGETHER- ACTUALLY IT'S QUITE APROPOS WE'RE HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY BECAUSE- AND- FORTUNATELY I THINK SOME STATES AT THE NEW YORK ADDS TO CLEAR DO WANT TO- SENSUALLY ISOLATE- PEOPLE COMING TRAVELING FROM CALIFORNIA TO THE STATE FOR FOURTEEN DAYS WHEN THEY SHOW UP- BUT- AND SANDERS OF. SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT- BUT I THINK ALSO AS EVEN WHEN THIS PANDEMIC WAS SPREADING- THERE'S SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER. SUCH ACTIVITY SUCH EFFORTS ARE- REALLY SUCCESSFUL IN TRYING TO LIMIT THE SPREAD OF THE- PANDEMIC THE SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD BUT- WHEN THE THINGS THAT IS EFFECTIVE IS ACTUALLY- EVENTUALLY BE ABLE TO MOVE TO A CONTAINMENT STRATEGY IN TERMS OF SIZE. THE ONLY INCREASING OUR TESTING BUT THEN DOING CONTACT TRACING AND THEN ISOLATING PEOPLE WHO ARE POSITIVE WITH THE DISEASE. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS ABOUT- THAT CROSS THE BORDER THAT WE HAVE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND MEXICO. WHAT THEIR DAUGHTERS SOME DISCUSSIONS GOING ON BETWEEN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH- HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND IN A CO ABOUT COOPERATING AND DOING- TESTING TRACING IN ISOLATION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE POSITIVE WHEN WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE- CAN MANAGE THAT AND- SO IN TERMS OF BECAUSE KNOWING THAT PEOPLE GOING ACROSS THE BORDER FOR MANY DIFFERENT REASONS SUMMER SENT TO WORKERS SOME BECAUSE OF TRADE AND OTHER THINGS- WHAT SORT OF COOPERATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH- NON. ARRANGEMENTS ARE BEING DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO. DO TESTING TRACING OF PEOPLE TO HELP BETTER CONTAIN ALBERY THAT MAY BE HAPPENING IS PEOPLE ARE COMING BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE BORDER. SO WE ARE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH PUBLIC HELP ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER EVERY DAY- I THINK THAT THAT CONTAINMENT STRATEGIES HAVE LARGELY BEEN ON THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER WE'RE WORKING WITH CDC TO PROVIDE RESOURCES I KNOW SAN DIEGO HAS PROVIDED SOME. TESTING AND CON AND SB EPIDEMIOLOGIC SUPPORT TO MEXICO I'M AND MORE WORK TO BE DONE FOR SURE- I THINK BAFFERT'S HAVE LARGELY BEEN ON THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER BUT IN COLLABORATION UNDERSTANDING THE RESOURCE NEEDS OF MEXICO AND WORKING WITH CDC TO BUY MORE OF THOSE RESOURCES. GEN AT AND OTHERS FROM SAN DIEGO MAY HAVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP ON THE GROUND ACROSS THE BORDER BUT OURS HAS BEEN THREE CDC AND THROUGH OUR OFFICE OF FINANCIAL BORDER HOW WE'RE WE'RE CERTAINLY HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT MOST OF. THEM WERE PROVIDING THEM SOME RESOURCES BUT THEY NEED MORE AND- AND WE ALSO- ARE PROVIDING MORE RESOURCES VERTICALLY TO IMPERIAL COUNTY TO SO THAT THEY CAN CONDUCT THE TESTING THAT THEY NEED ON THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER. RIGHT WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT RESPONSE- SAID THIS IS A GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND- WE'LL DEFINITELY NEED TO WORK TOGETHER IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT- UNITED STATES IS. NOT FUNDING THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION- BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WE'RE ARE PART OF ONE WORLD AND THIS IS A PANDEMIC IT DOESN'T CARE ABOUT POLITICAL BORDERS AND SO WILL CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THOSE EFFORTS SO WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK. IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH. OUR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS INCLUDING MEDICO TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN JOINTLY STOP THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE. IT'S NOT BECAUSE IT'S COMING IN FROM OUTSIDE IT'S BECAUSE- IT'S- IT'S SPREADING ACROSS THE ROUND THE WORLD FROM WITHIN AND FROM AROUND SO WE ALL NEED TO WORK TOGETHER WE'RE ALL IN IT TOGETHER SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON- BUILDINGS THAT. KIND INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED TO WITH MEDICO. TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF EVERYONE IN BOTH COUNTRIES THANK YOU. WE'VE HEARD FROM THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT FROM PRO COMMUNIST SINGLE NOT WILL GO TO JIM GROSS. FROM CYNICAL I'M SORRY- CENTER RUBIO DID YOU HAVE A- COMMENT OR QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION AND THREE DOES FALL UNDER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. JURISDICTION BUT IT WILL BECOME A PROBLEM IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANSWERS OR SOLUTIONS- I UNDERSTAND THAT THE FEDERALLY OPERATED PULLED HIM AS A DETENTION FACILITY HAS IDENTIFIED A HUNDRED AND SIXTY INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE TESTED POSITIVE. AND I AM ALSO- I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT OTHERS PLANTS THREE SOME OF THE CHILDREN OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN PERMISSION TO RELEASE THESE CHILDREN AND I THINK IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY BUT- WHAT THERE IS CONFUSION AROUND WAS. IF THEY'RE GONNA BE RESET THEIR PARENTS OR INDIVIDUALLY SO I WANT TO JUST NOT THERE THEY HAVE ANSWERS TO THAT. AND IF THEY'RE BEING RELEASED BY THEMSELVES IS THERE A PLAN FOR THESE CHILDREN AND DIE CLEARLY THERE'S A HUNDRED AND SIXTY PEOPLE AND INFECTED.

FEEL ADDITIONAL WE ARMY TO FOCUS ON THE BORDER ISSUES AND TO. ENSURE THAT. WE ARE RESPONDING TO THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THE BORDER REGION.

OF CHILL THIS TIME AND- THAT ALSO COMES MEMBER- STEVE BY THE I UNDERSTAND YOUR- BOTH GIVEN A JOINT PRESENTATION WELCOME THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR PARTICIPATION VERY MUCH IN YOUR WORK FOR THE PEOPLE CHELVESTON. WHAT MORNING SENATOR WEBSITE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CONVENING THIS REALLY IMPORTANT HEARING. AND JOB I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME SPEAK TODAY ON THE IMPACT OF CODE NINETEEN THAT ENDEMIC. ON THE CITY AND- CHILL BASED IN THE STOPPING. SO CHILL THE STATE IS LOCATED IN SOUTH COUNTY- AND IT'S ABOUT FOUR MILES FROM THAT MEXICO BORDER. AND WE HAVE A POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE WHICH IS ABOUT THE SCENT OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY. CHILLED LESTAT IS THE FIFTEENTH LARGEST CITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IT'S THE MEDICAL AND COMMERCIAL HUB. US IS OUT COUNTY REGION. AND IT'S IMPORTANT AS THE ONLY TRUE FULL SERVICE HOSPITALS WITHIN A SEVEN MILE RADIUS OF THE SAN DIEGO TIJUANA BORDER REGION- ARE IN CHILDRESS THEM. SO THERE'D ADDITIONAL APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO ARE US CITIZENS OR LEGAL RESIDENTS WHO LIVE IN BAJA CALIFORNIA. AND CAN PROP SUPPORTER TO SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION. AND THESE INCREASES IN PATIENTS. ARE IMPACTING OUR LOCAL HOSPITAL. CHILDRESS THAT WAS A FIRST IN THE CAN. THAT RECORD. COULD BE NINETEEN CASE IN EARLY MARCH AND WE ENGAGED WITH THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO- IMMEDIATELY AND SOUGHT DIRECTION IN THE SYSTEM. EVEN WITH THE QUICK RESPONSE CHILL THE STATE HAS EXPERIENCED A MUCH HIGHER RATE THAN OTHER CITIES IN THE COUNTY EXCEPT FOR NATIONAL CITY WHICH IS OUR NEIGHBOR. AND WITH ONLY 8% OF THE POPULATION WE HAVE HAD UP NOW AS OF YESTERDAY OUR FOURTEEN POINT 2% OF THE CASES. OUR EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE SPREAD IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT SINCE WE ARE BROUGHT A THRIVING BI NATIONAL REGION. AND ALTHOUGH WE BANNED NONESSENTIAL TRAVEL ACROSS THE BORDER WE CANNOT STOP CITIZENS OR PERMANENT RESIDENTS OR PEOPLE WITH WORK BASIS FROM CROSSING THE BORDER. WE HAVE BEEN LUCKY THAT WE HAVE HAD EMERGENCY FINANCIAL RESERVES TO FIND MANY EFFORTS THAT THOSE RESEARCH HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED. WITH NO CONSIDERATION OP ABOUT THE IMPACT OF CODE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE GOVERNMENT ARE ALLOCATING. FUNDING BASED ON POPULATION AND NOT ON THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF THE VIRUS INDIVIDUAL MUNICIPALITIES. OUR CITY IS ONLY GETTING A FRACTION OF WHAT IT NEEDS TO HELP STOP THE PANDEMIC AND THE IMPACTS OF THIS PANDEMIC. A PERFECT EXAMPLE IS THIS. THE CITY STOCKTON WHICH HAS A POPULATION OF THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN PEOPLE HAS AS OF JUNE FOURTEENTH JUNE TWENTY FIFTH FOURTEEN HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE CASES AND ARE GETTING A PER CAPITA YOU'RE- GETTING A PER CAPITA OF THE CARES ACT ALLOCATION. OF EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS AND TWENTY SEVEN CENTS PER RESIDENT WHERE IS THE CITY OF CHOCOLATE CHILL MISTER WITH POPULATION OF TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE AS OF JUNE TWENTY SEVENTH AS WELL WE HAVE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SIXTEEN CASES AND ONLY GETTING A CAP PER CAPITA SURE OF THE SACKED ALLOCATIONOF TWELVE DOLLARS AND TWENTY CENTS. SO THAT'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS VERSUS TWELVE DOLLARS. THIS IS A STARK EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS FORMULA IS LEAVING CITIES LIKE CHILDREN STEP HOBBLED IN ITS EFFORTS TO CONTROL THE SPREAD OF THE COVERT NINETEEN. AND LEAVES US HEAVILY DISADVANTAGED TO MAINTAIN THE NEEDED SERVICES TO OUR RESIDENTS DURING THIS PANDEMIC. AND NOT TO MENTION THE NEED THE NEEDED MEDICATION OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS THAT THIS PANDEMIC HAS HAD ON OUR COMMUNITY. AND WHAT WE ARE STRIVING TO MEET THESE DEMANDS WITH THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE IT IS NOT ENOUGH. THIS VIRUS IS IMPACTED OUR REGION AND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE CRITICAL WE ARE- EIGHT IF WE ARE TO STEM THE SPREAD OF THIS AND ARE. THE KERR LINE WAS INTERRUPTED THAT FROZE. MICELLES BECAUSE- MER SELES FEW CAN HEAR US- WE LOST YOU THEN MAYBE WE COULD HAVE A COUNCIL MEMBER BY THE MAYBE FILL IN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND SHARE GONZALEZ ON ONE THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE TODAY. ON THE ENTIRE SOUTH SAN DIEGO COUNTY IS NOW IN SAN DIEGO IS CONSIDERED A HOT SPOT UNCLE BIT NINETEEN CASES. JUST COUNTY COMMUNITIES IN CHULA VISTA NATIONAL CITY BENITA SINESTRO TIME MESA BEACH COUNT FOR ABOUT POPULATION AND COLLECTIVELY FOR ABOUT THIRTY TWO PERCENT. OF OUR COUNTIES POSITIVE CASES AS OF JUNE TWENTY SEVENTH. AS YOU MAY KNOW I AM A SURVIVOR OF KOBE NINETEEN FOR ELEVEN DAYS I WAS ON A VENTILATOR AND METAL MEDICALLYINDUCED COMA. I LOST TWENTY SEVEN POUNDS AND ONE OF MY LUNGS PARTIALLY COLLAPSED. I UNDERSTAND FIRSTHAND THE PEOPLE IMPACT OF THIS DISEASE CAN HAVE ON OUR COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED. STRENGTH AS YOU KNOW OUR ORDER REGION IS DERIVED FROM THE ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL INTERDEPENDENCY THAT OCCURS WITH THOUSANDS OF BORDER CROSSINGS EVERY SINGLE DAY. ANGEL THIS TO MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS LIVE AND WORK ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER MEDICAL TOURISM IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE REGIONAL ECONOMY. AS PEOPLE SEEK HEALTHCARE SERVICES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER IN THIS MOVEMENT IS OFTEN. MANDATED BY THE NATURE OF FRONTLINE WORKERS ON A CRITICAL SERVICE WORKERS THAT RESIDE IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTY. THAT HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT FOR WORKING PLEASE STAND AND- A HIGHER RISK FOR EXPOSURE. THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE SEEKING QUALITY HEALTHCARE IN THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO CERTAINLY PRESENTS OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACCESS IT ALSO INCREASES THE POSSIBILITY OF THE SPREAD OF. NINETEEN AS I SAID. HE SAID THAT HISTORICALLY AFFECTED BY HIGHER PERCENTAGES OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS. BASED ON THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY STRAUSS AN EAGLE COUNTY REGION HAS HIGHER CURRENTS IS OF ASTHMA DIABETES HEART DISEASE AND IS NOW WELL KNOWN- THERE IS SOME CORRELATION BETWEEN OTHER CO MORBIDITIES AND THE RISK OF SERIOUS ILLNESS CONNECTION CC AT NINETEEN. ACCORDING TO THE COUNTY SAN DIEGO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN DIABETES AND HEART DISEASE OR LEADING CAUSES OF REALLY BEST BASED ON CHRONIC DISEASE JEWEL OF ESTA. AS MAYOR SALAS INDICATED WE ARE ON THE FRONTLINE OF THE COLD THE CRISIS WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER A FAIR ALLOCATION OF FUNDING IS NEEDED TO CONTINUE TO PRESS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE WELL BEING OF OUR RESIDENTS. ANY STATE FUNDING SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED IN A STRATEGIC WAY. NOT JUST BASED ON POPULATION THREATS POLLS OR PER CAPITA SHARES. BUT STRATEGICALLY DIRECTED TO AFFECT DIRECT IMPACTS WHERE IT IS NEEDED MOST. OBVIOUSLY THIS INCLUDES THE NEED TO REACH THE MOST VULNERABLE AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST INFECTION RATES AFFECTED DISTRIBUTION ESTATE PLANNING PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOT ONLY PROTECT THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE. BUT TO BREAK DOWN CULTURAL AND LANGUAGE BARRIERS THAT A PERSONAL ON STYMIED OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. AND I THINK THE CHAIRS AGAIN. WOULD CERTAINLY BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT AND YOU KNOW AS AS THE SENATE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BORDER IF I COULD JUST SEND ON TO THOSE COMMENTS UNITS BEEN VERY. COMPLICATED TO ADVOCATE FOR MY DISTRICT BEING THAT IT'S THE ONLY DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE BORDERS OF FOREIGN COUNTRY AND- AND OF COURSE THE COMPLICATIONS OF THAT BRING BRING SO MANY- CHALLENGES TO- PROVIDING ARE. ADEQUATE SURE FUNDING THIS IS AN INSTANCE IN WHICH WE SEE ONE OF THE LARGEST BANKS IN THE STATE WITH WITH NO- REAL- PROPORTIONAL- RESPONSE AND RESOURCES TO THAT PROBLEM. AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOU YOU MADE SOME COMMENTS RELATING TO THE CARES ACT FUNDING AND HOW THAT'S BEEN APPLIED TO THE STATE THERE'S SOME PARTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE NO CASES. THAT HAVE THAT ARE SEEN DECREASES AND NOT INCREASES. AND WELL WE HAVE ALREADY INCREASES THERE WE DON'T HAVE. THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO AID IN THAT SO WE WERE WORKING VERY HARD TO MAKE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF AWARE OF THAT THE CALLOW YES OFFICES FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION HERE WAS VERY IMPORTANT. AND IN IN IN IN PASSED. UP POLICIES LIKE THE CALAMARI WERE STREAM COMPLETELY LEFT OUT THE BORDER REGIONS IN THE IMPACTS BECAUSE THE TO MEASURING DEVICES ALONG THE BORDER WERE NOT AVAILABLE SO THAT JUST MEANT THAT- THERE WAS NO FUNDING FROM THAT SOURCE TO HELP. COMMUNITIES COMBAT POOR AIR QUALITY AND- AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS AND OF COURSE THAT'S BEEN EXACERBATED HERE ONE THING CALL THAT HAS DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF SHOWING. THE VULNERABILITY OF CERTAIN COMMUNITIES AND WHEN WE SEE THAT THE BORDER COMMUNITIES DEFINITELY VULNERABLE OF MERIT MANY THINGS EMERGENCIES HEALTH CRISIS- ENVIRONMENTAL CRISES. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION IN YOUR COMMENTS. OF WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON ON OUR CALENDAR WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO- CHRIS VAN GORDER SHE'S HE HE'S A PRESIDENT. AND CEO OF GAZELLE A. JERRY SURE REEF THE MD NCM OF SCRIPTS HEALTH.

WE HAVE A SCRIPT HEALTH THANK YOU FOR TAKING NOTICE OF THE IMPACTS OF THE COVERED NINETEEN AND THEN MAKE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BORDER COMMUNITIES THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR EXPERIENCES WITH YOU TODAY. THAT'S CHRIS WE TAKE PRIDE IN OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO DISASTERS SCRIPT HAS RESPONDED TO EMERGENCIES LIKE HURRICANE KATRINA. AND THE PARADISE FIRE SOME MORE. BUT THE SPEND AND MAKE IS DIFFERENT. TRIPS BEGAN TO SEE THE CORONA VIRUS THREAT BECOME A REALITY FOR OUR REGION BACK IN FEBRUARY. FEBRUARY SCRIPTS PREPARED FOR AND TREATED VERY EARLY TRAVELERS FROM CHINA. WERE QUARANTINED AT MARINE CORPS AIR STATION MIRAMAR IN SAN DIEGO. BUT THAT EXPERIENCE FIRST QUICKLY WRAPPED UP THE ENTIRE SYSTEM FOR COVERT NINETEEN RESPONSE. ON MARCH NINTH WE WERE NOTIFIED BY THE COUNTY OF OUR FIRST PUBLIC POSITIVE PATIENT AND SCRIPTS. THE FIRST KNOWN CASE IN SAN DIEGO. IN THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC OUR EARLY CASES WERE NORTH COUNTY SAN DIEGO. WE QUICKLY OPENED A NURSE HOTLINE. FOR NOT ONLY SCRIPT STATIONS BUT FOR THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE WE STOOD UP TRIAGE FACILITIES ARE HOSPITALS AND DRIVE AT TESTING SITES. AND THAT ARE URGENT CARE FACILITIES. BUT BEFORE I PROCEED I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE GOVERNESS IN. THE LEGISLATURE. I IN OU COUNTY SWIFT ACTION DURING THESE EARLY MONTHS TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC. YOUR ACTIONS TO COURAGE AND WE'RE NOT WITHOUT RISKING CRITICISM. THAT HAD YOU NOT TAKEN EARLY ACTION MANY MORE LIVES FOR THE LOSS TO THE SPEND DOWN. AND WE THANK YOU FROM THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. THAT'S THE NUMBERS BEGAN TO GROW IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WE SAW SON SHIFT IN MID APRIL. AND APRIL EIGHTEENTH WE HAD CAN COPE WITH POSITIVE PATIENTS ALL AT ONCE. IN OUR CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. AND EVERY DAY AFTER THAT THE NUMBERS CONTINUE TO GROW. SCRIPTURAL ACOSTA HOSPITALS ABOUT TEN MILES FROM THE SENATE CEDAR PORT OF ENTRY. AS YOU KNOW THAT'S THE BUSIEST LAND BORDER CROSSING IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE. IN APRIL THE SAN DIEGO UNION TRIBUNE WAS REPORTING THAT THE CASES AND SENATE CEDAR BROUGH A HUNDRED AND ELEVEN PERCENT. BETWEEN APRIL FOURTEENTH AND APRIL TWENTY. DURING THE SAME TIME BOTH SCRIPTS AND SHARP HOSPITALS IN CHáVEZ TO. THE NEAREST HOSPITAL SERVING THE SAN DIEGO TIJUANA BORDER. EXPERIENCED AVERAGES ABOUT PERCENT EIGHTEEN PERCENT. POSITIVE CO THAT NINETEEN TEST RESULTS COMPARED TO AN AVERAGE OF 6% POSITIVE RESULTS. ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTY. FOR THE WEEKS TO FOLLOW THAT NUMBER BECAME EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED. OR HOSPITALS ANGELES TO SUSPECTS EXCEEDING 25% POSITIVES. WELL THE COUNTY PERCENTAGES OF POSITIVES MORE BROADLY. DROPS BELOW 5% BY THE END OF A- EIGHTY. OF OUR COVERT PATIENTS ORDER TWO SCRIPTS HOSPITALS. FURTHER UP 48% OF CODE BUT POSITIVE PATIENTS WHO VISITED OUR CHILL THIS DIVERGENCE AROUND BETWEEN MAY TWENTY FOURTH. AND MAY THIRTIETH SAID THEY HAD RECENTLY TRAVELED TO MEXICO. THAT FIGURE JUMP 260% BETWEEN MAY THIRTY FIRST AND JUNE SECOND. ONLY ABOUT 5% OF IT NINETEEN PATIENTS REPORTED THAT THEY'D RECENTLY BEEN TO MEXICO THAT'S GROUP'S OTHER THREE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. WE'RE FORTUNATE SCRIPT AND SHARPER BOTH SYSTEMS OF MULTIPLE HOSPITALS AND SO WELL OUR CHILDREN'S TO HOSPITALS WERE NEAR CAPACITY FOR WEEKS ON END. WE HAVE THE LUXURY OF BEING ABLE TO TRANSFER SOME OF THOSE PATIENTS TO HOSPITALS IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTY. A MAY ELEVENTH SCRIPTED SIX PATIENTS ARRIVE AT SCRIPT RESIDUAL MISTER DIRECTLY FROM THE BORDER WITHIN AN HOUR. FOR BY AND LISTEN TO WALKING. THROUGH THOSE PATIENTS FOR BACK TO BACK INTO PATIENTS AS THEY WERE CRITICALLY ILL WHEN THEY ARRIVE. THIS EXPERIENCE IS NOT UNIQUE TO SUPPRESS THIS TREND CONTINUES TODAY JUST LAST WEEK RECEIVE SEVEN AMBULANCES FROM THE BORDER TORTURE LISTA HOSPITAL. BY THIS TIME AND THEN WE ARE TRANSFERRED FORTY THREE PATIENTS FROM FROM SOUTHERN HOSPITALS. ARE NORTHERN HOSPITALS TO MAKE ROOM IN THE SOUTH. TODAY THAT NUMBER IS MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN I THINK AS OF THIS MORNING WAS A HUNDRED AND- FIFTY SEVEN. OUR PATIENTS WE TRANSFERRED FROM THE SOUTH. WE SAW US LIKE STABILIZATION AT THE END OF MAY AND THE BEGINNING OF JUNE. HOWEVER SINCE JUNE NINETEENTH OUR NUMBERS OF COVERT POSITIVE TEST RESULTS. HAVE NOT ONLY GONE BACK UP. THE NUMBERS ARE DOUBLING. ON JUNE TWENTY SECOND OF FORTY THREE UNIQUE NEW COVERT POSITIVE CASES SYSTEM WIDE. THE HIGHEST SINCE THE SINCE THE START OF THIS PANDEMIC. NEW RECORDS WERE SET THE FOLLOWING TWO CONSECUTIVE DAYS. OUR DAILY AVERAGE IS NOW WELL ABOVE THE PREVIOUS GAVE THE CASE RECORDS CYNICAL PREVIOUS PEAK. WAY BACK IN MARCH. ON JUNE TWENTY THIRD WE HAVE FORTY EIGHT UNIQUE NEW COVERED A POSITIVE CASES SYSTEM WIDE. HI. THIS IS THE START OF ENDEMIC. OUR NURSE HOTLINE IS AN AVERAGE OF ONE THAT. SIX ON CALLS FOR WEEK. ATOP FROM. FROM WHAT STARTED ABOUT THIS ONE THOUSAND. SCRIPTS ALONE DISPOSES THE CHALLENGER STAFFING. OUR SUPPLIES AND PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND SO MUCH MORE. AS WE FIGHT THE COVER NINETEEN BY RESTRICTIONS USING TEN THOUSAND SURGICAL MASKS ONE THOUSAND AND NINETY FIVE MASKS SIX THOUSAND ISOLATION GALS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND GLOVES EVERY DAY. THE NEED IS GREAT THE CHALLENGES ARE BORDER COMMUNITIES ARE COMPLEX GIVEN THE INTEGRATED NATURE OUR FAMILIES OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR ECONOMY. WE ARE NOT A SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY THREE MILLION PEOPLE WE ARE COMMUNITY THREE MILLION PEOPLE IN SAN DIEGO PLUS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF US CITIZENS. YOU'LL CITIZENS AND MEXICAN NATIONALS WITH THE NEEDS AND RIGHTS TO CROSS THE BORDER. SENATE HOSPITALS ARE ALSO LIFELINE TO SUPPORT THE HEALTHCARE NEEDS IMPERIAL VALLEY AND ACCEPTED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TRANSFER STUDENTS DIFFICULT CRIME. AS OF THIS MORNING WE HAD ACCEPTED TWO HUNDRED THIRTY ONE PATIENT TRANSFERS FROM THE BUREAU COUNTY. HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE FROM PIONEERS AND A FORTY EIGHT FROM EL CENTRO REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER AND EIGHTY ONE OF THOSE STATIONS REPUBLIC POSITIVE. SO WE DON'T NEED A BURGER CO CLOSURE WE NEED SUPPORT. WE NEED SUPPLIES EP MEDICATION. THE AGENTS FOR OUR LABS- AN FDA APPROVED SLOBS FOR BOTH OF THE NINETEEN AN INFLUENZA ALL OF WHICH ARE IN DEEP IN SHORT SUPPLY. AND WE NEED CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO PROTECT THE COMMUNITIES OF ALL SIDES. WE APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME BECAUSE THAT'S. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WE HAVE A LARRY LEWIS THE CEO. OF PIONEERS MEMORIAL HEALTH CARE DISTRICT. THE MORNING DELIVERS AND THANK YOU FOR OFFERING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK PAUL RYAN YEARS EXPERIENCE DURING THE COLD EMERGENCY FIVE YEARS IS A LOCATED ABOUT- TWO HOURS EAST OF SAN DIEGO ON ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILES NORTH OF THE MEXICAN. BORDER HUNDRED AND SEVEN BEDS SO WHERE ARE ROLL HOSPITAL HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION THE NET REVENUES AND ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED EMPLOYEES- LIKE EVERYONE'S EXPERIENCE WE SAW THIS IS A FAR AWAY STORM AT FIRST BUT NATIONAL NEWS IT WAS LIKE CRACKING UP FOR EIGHTEEN- REPORTS WERE FIRST HEARD. OF YOUR THE FIRST OF THE YEAR- CERTAINLY THOUGH REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK CITY PAINTED SOME ENHANCE USE OF THE POSSIBLE COVERT STORM. GETTING THIS NATION- CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION MEMBERS THE OPERATIONS CENTER ALARMS WENT OFF SHORTLY THEREAFTER. IN EARLY MARCH- CH A EXECUTIVE BOARD OF DIRECTORS SOME URGENT ALARM REQUESTING HOSPITALS DEVELOP A- FLEX PLAN FOR A CO WITH PATIENTS STORM SURGE- IN PREPARING. FOR THAT STORM OF. FOR YEARS A STATUS IT IS A COMMAND SYSTEM IN EARLY MARCH- AND WE BEGAN BY. SPACE ICE USE SPACE MOVING UP FROM EIGHT LICENSED BED STOP THE THIRTEEN QUICKLY AND THE MENTALLY UP TO THIRTY TWO BEDS- JUSTIN SPACE PLANS A NEGATIVE AIR SPACE- STARTING AT TWENTY NINE- TO MOVE QUICKLY TO FORTY- TODAY OR AT FIFTY EIGHT- SO. METROPASS OF THE REALLY WAS PLANNED PLEASE THANK. BY WITH. THE POSSIBLE OF COULD. OF EXTERIOR TENSE AND THE SHELTERS UP WE HAD CLOSED FROM ELECTED SIR. AND THE SHOW IN A RESULTANT IN A PERCENT IMMEDIATE AND ARE CLINIC WERE CUT IN HALF EMERGENCY ROOMS- SURGERIES ALL DECREASED DRAMATICALLY pOVERNIGHT WITH THE- SHELTER IN ORDER- ALSO CREATED A CASH CRUNCH- AND RESULTED IN SOLEIL OFF EARLY ON NOT KNOWING WHAT TO REALLY EXPECT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND NO INDICATION BOTH. WHAT KIND OF RELIEF WOULD BE ORGANIZED. BUT THE STORES OF THE STORM SURGE DID INCREASE- AND CERTAINLY EL CENTRO WHAT YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM NEXT- AT A PARTICULAR MUCH HIGHER A NUMBER OF ADMISSIONS THE PIONEERS- BUT- YEARS IN MARCH OUR FIRST CASE WAS ON MARCH SIXTEENTH. WE HAD- NINE NEW ADMISSIONS IN MARCH AND APRIL TWENTY ONE NEW ADMISSIONS AT LIKELY YOU'LL WE ALSO ANTICIPATE BY- OR EXPECT BY EASTER ESCALATION- AND WE HAVE NO CASES TRANSFERRED FROM PIONEERS THAT WORK BUT PATIENTS A MONTH. IN MAY- WE PROCEEDED TO SEE SIXTY TWO NEW INVENTIONS- ALSO FUELED BY A MOTHER STAY IN A MEMORIAL DAY IS WHAT WE AS SOON AS WE FOR LIKE DAYS WHAT THE INCREASES. AND WE TRANSFERRED TWENTY EIGHT CASES THAT MONTH ALONE. EARLY JUNE- WE WERE ON A PACE IN THE FIRST NINE DAYS FOR ABOUT SIXTY NEW CASES OUT OF A TOTAL NUMBER RIGHT NOW BUT I'M SURE IT'S IN THE SEVENTIES. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT WE- SEVENTIES K. OF THREE JUNE TWO EIGHTH SO A DRUM. IN WHAT YOU SEE IN A WAY A SON. IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY FROM THE AREA- AND WE'RE RIGHT NOW ANTICIPATING A STRONG POSSIBILITY- THAT THE FOR THE JULY COULD RESULT IN HERE OR GREATER- CONTACT AND SPREAD OF THE DISEASE SO- WE'RE PLANNING ON THIS LEVEL TO CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT YEAR WE'VE GONE AWAY FROM A- SHORT TERM STRATEGY AND HOW THE WE- WORK THROUGH THIS CRISIS TO THIS IS OUR NEW WAY OF OPERATING- THE FINANCIAL PRESSURES- ARE GREAT- WE DID SEE SOME TEARS ACT. FUNDING WHICH GREATLY HELPED US AS WELL- MOST. RECENTLY IN JUNE. AND BUT IT'S REALLY- WITHOUT ANY NOTIFICATION OF WHAT TO EXPECT OR HOW MUCH TO EXPECT. OR WHAT'S COMING NEXT IF ANYTHING SO WHAT WE'RE IN A GOOD POSITION TODAY THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE GREAT NEEDS- RESOURCE SHORTAGES- AS CHRIS MENTIONED- THE PPVS. IMMEDIATELY NOTHING WAS AVAILABLE AND YOU COULDN'T INCREASE SUPPLIES OF ALL- BUT WE DO- THANK OUR- YOU'LL SEE PARTNERS- IN THE COUNTY. WHO HAVE BEEN VERY RESPONSIBLE NOT. TESTING AS WELL REAL TIME WE HAD NO TESTING THEN SOME TESTING AND NOW MORE TESTING BUT- NOW WE HAVE. LET'S SAY SPORADIC INTERRUPTIONS OTHER CAUSES TO SHUT DOWN. FOR A DAY OR TWO OR THREE AT A TIME EQUIPMENT ACQUISITIONS- VENTILATORS PRIMARILY- THE STATE WAS VERY QUICK TO REACT AS WELL AS OUR COUNTY YOU'LL SEE. A TO A PROVIDED SOME TRANSPORT LAYERS. BUT THEY'RE NOT INTENDED REALLY FOR LONG TERM USE- REGGIE OPERATIONS ABOUT HER SUPPORT HAS BEEN GREAT- AS I MENTIONED THE RPG'S- THEY PROVIDED AND ARE QUICK RESPONSIVENESS THEIR GREATLY APPRECIATE I THINK THAT THE ORGANIZATION OF THE MURDERS THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN A MUCH GREATER THAN I EVER EXPECTED- THE TRANSFER CENTER HAS BEEN VERY PROMPT AND DAVE DUNCAN THIS BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE. NATIONAL GUARD THAT THEY PROVIDED WAS MUCH NEEDED AND JUST IN TIME. AS FAR AS SUGGESTIONS GO. AND WE LOOK TO SEE THAT- IN THE FUTURE WE CAN CONTINUE TO- COORDINATE OUR OUR MEETINGS AND OUR EMAILS AND- IT STARTED PLAN MORE ON. IT'S EASY TO ADD NEW SPACE IS MORE DIFFICULT TO ADD STAFF AND THOSE WERE PRIORITIZING NEEDS I DO SEE THAT THE YOU'LL SEE IS REALLY STRONGLY SUPPORTING US MORE IN- STAFF NEEDS WHICH IS WHAT REALLY NEED BECAUSE THERE IS EXISTING SPACE. IT JUST NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO BE ABLE TO CREATE THAT. WE SHOULD STAND UP THE FACILITIES FIRST AND THAT COMES WITH STAFFING AS FAR AS LOW SHORT TERM FUTURE OF CHANGE. I TO GO CHANGES THE DIFFICULT WHAT WE SEE IS THE LIONS CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE TRANSFERS CONTINUE TO INCREASE. AND THERE'S NO EMINENT VACCINE OR CURE IDENTIFIED IN THE NEXT SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS. SO IT'S ABOUT PLANNING FOR THE CHANGE AND AS I MENTIONED BEFORE NOW IT'S NOT ABOUT DEALING WITH THE CRISIS IS AN ONGOING WAY OF LIFE NOW- AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. SO RESOURCES THAT WE NEED- I LOOK FIRST TO YOU KNOW THERE ARE MORE PLENTIFUL SUPPLIES AVAILABLE. BUT I'LL CALL IT OR WAITED TO FOOD INSECURITY IT'S SUPPLY AND SECURITY- WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE NEXT SHIPMENT WILL BE OR HOW BIG THOSE ORDERS ARE GOING TO DEMAND A WELDER- A SUPPLIER WHETHER IT CUT BACK ON- BUT WE HAVE SEEN GREAT INCREASES OF NAS'S. BEEN VERY HELPFUL. THERE'S OUR URGENT NEED FOR TREATMENT RESOURCE ARE ALL RAPID TESTING- ORDERS ARE NOT RELIABLE- WE RUN SHORTLY A SHORT REGULARLY- I DID HEAR FROM THE NATIONAL GUARD THIS MORNING WHICH I WAS A GREAT TO HEAR- I THINK ON SATURDAY ALTHOUGH THEY WERE IN ON THE US STATES VISIT. OUT TO THE COUNTY. AND HEARD ABOUT THE- LOCAL GOT A SHORTAGE OF THOSE SUPPLIES FOR A BY A FIRE. THIS MORNING THEY CALL THE SAID THAT- THEY EXPECT TO BE DOWN HERE SHORTLY- WITH WILDFIRE AND SUPPLIES AND STAFF TO RUN IT- SO THAT'S LOGISTICS IS BEING WORKED OUT RIGHT NOW- FROM DOUBLE ZERO OF THE STATE YOUR PHARMACEUTICAL TREATMENT REGIMEN IS ALSO A SHORTAGE OUT THERE- THERE HAVE BEEN. SIGNIFICANT INCREASES AND I DID HEAR THAT WE WERE DUE ANY DAY NOW TO RECEIVE THE NEXT UP FRONT- BUT AGAIN WE'RE GETTING BACK TO UP THERE'S BEEN GREAT IMPROVEMENTS AND NOW IT'S ABOUT THE IN SECURITY ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THAT UP.

VIRUS IMPACT ON TRAVEL AND- AND HOSPITALS AS A PLACE TO HEAL AS A PLACE AS OPPOSED TO A PLACE TO AVOID BECAUSE OF THE VIRUS. ALL OF THOSE ARE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT. LONG TERM IMPACTS OF PRIMARY CARE IN RURAL AREAS IS ALWAYS NEEDED.

WITH MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND SIXTY INDIVIDUALS HAVING TESTED POSITIVE FOR KOBE NINETEEN. INDIVIDUALS DETAINED AT THEIR TIME IS A DETENTION CENTER WERE COERCED DESIGN LEGAL WAIVERS AS THE ONLY WAY TO OBTAIN PP. INDEED THE OPERATION OF BOTH OF THESE FACILITIES BY FOR PROFIT OPERATORS RAISES SERIOUS QUESTIONS AS TO HOW DECISIONS INVOLVING PUBLIC SAFETY ARE BEING CARRIED OUT. RESPITE MIGRANT SHELTER IN THE BORDERLANDS THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF A RESPITE MIGRANT SHELTERED TO THE PROTECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS VIOLATE VITALLY IMPORTANT DEFENSE OPERATE SAN DIEGO'S MIGRANT FAMILY SHELTER AND WE HAVE ASSISTED MORE THAN TWENTY THREE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS SINCE OCTOBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND IT'S INCLUDES ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CHILDREN. OUR JOB WAS TO ENSURE OUR SHELTER GAS WERE HEALTHY AND ABLE TO TRAVEL TO THEIR FINAL DESTINATION. TODAY WITH THE BORDER EFFECTIVELY CLOSE THE NUMBER OF ASYLUM SEEKING FAMILIES WE ARE ASSISTING HAS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED THOUGH WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THESE NUMBERS WILL AGAIN INCREASE ONCE THE SAME DIEGO IMMIGRATION COURT RESUMES HEARINGS. IN MID JULY FOR INDIVIDUALS AND ROLLED INTO THE REMAINING MEXICO PROGRAM. AGAIN IT WILL BE THROUGH A COORDINATED EFFORT BY JEFF ASSN OTHERS IN ADDITION TO GOVERNOR GOVERNMENT PARTNERS INCLUDING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WILL BE CRITICAL IN MEETING THE UNIQUE NEEDS PRESENTED IN OUR REGION. JEFF THAT'S UNDERSTANDS THAT THE STATE IS FACING AN UNPRECEDENTED FISCAL CRISIS NOT BROUGHT ON BY AN ECONOMIC RECESSION BUT BY A PANDEMIC THAT WAS BROUGHT. AND THAT IS THE WORLD TO A HALT. IF WE CONTINUE TO SEE HOW KOBE NINETEEN IT WONDERFUL POPULATION THE HARDEST THOSE WITH WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEMS SENIORS PEOPLE OF COLOR AND- THIS. SUCCESS WE WILL PAY OVER THIS BY. WILL BE MEASURED ABOUT. BY HOW WELL WE ARE FOR CARE FOR- PEOPLE THAT ARE MOST AT RISK IN OUR STATE AND IN THIS MOMENT JEFF US RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR THE STATE. TO CONTINUE INVESTMENT OR IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES IN ADDITION TO ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT OVER THE DETENTION CONDITIONS FOR THE TWO. DETENTION FACILITIES IN OUR REGION THOUGH THERE ARE OTHERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CONTINUED INVESTMENT- TO MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE REPS BUT SHELTER OPERATED BY JACK FAST FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS RELEASE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH. CONTINUED INVESTMENT FOR THE DIRECT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE FEDERAL STIMULUS DOLLARS VIA THE CARES ACT. I JEFF THAT'S OUR CALL TO ACTION IS MOVING FORWARD TOGETHER. THIS IS WHAT WE INTEND TO DO THROUGH THIS CRISIS AND BEYOND AND AGAIN I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR DAY TO DAY IN THE CHALLENGES WE SEEK TO RESPOND TO AND FIND SOLUTIONS FOR. AS THE SITUATION CONTINUES TO ABOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHAT A GREAT PRESENTATION AND THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK ON BEHALF OF. THE PEOPLE OF OUR COMMUNITY CENTER REPEAL DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION. YES THIS QUESTION IS FOR KATE- CLARK. AFTER TWO OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICES I'VE JUST I'VE BEEN ONE OF THE PRIVILEGE WANTS TO TAKE A TOUR WITH YOU ARE NOT ONLY IN THE JEWISH CENTER BUT ALSO THE ALL TIME SO DETENTION CENTER. I JUST WANT A LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN EXPANSION ON THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE CURSED TO SIGN WAIVERS. IF YOU CAN EXPAND ON THAT OF WHAT HAS BEEN THE OUTCOME OF THOSE THAT THAT WERE COERCED AND- WHERE DID THE END. BASED ON THOSE CORPORATIONS. SURE WE HAD RECEIVE THAT INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM OUR CLIENTS- OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS REALLY. IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT THERE THE INFORMATION THAT'S BEING- SHARED WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BEING DETAINED SPECIFICALLY IF YOUR TIME IS A DETENTION. CENTER IS REALLY OUT OF A VACUUM THERE'S NOT REALLY. ANY ANY STRUCTURE A SYSTEM IN PLACE TO ENSURE. THAT BE ADDED TEAMED INDIVIDUALS HAVE- THEIR THEIR SAFETY AND WELLNESS BEING CARED FOR OR THEIR VESTING INTERESTS ARE BEING LOOKED AFTER OF COURSE BE A STILL YOUR SAN DIEGO AND IMPERIAL COUNTIES HAVE SINCE CHALLENGED- AND BROUGHT SUIT AGAINST. IMMIGRATION CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT FOR. ON THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE- TO MEET THE DETENTION FACILITY BUT- WE CONTINUE TO SEE OR TO RECEIVE- HORRIFIC REPORTS FROM OUR CLIENTS AND OTHERS WHO ARE YOU. ARE SEEKING LEGAL SERVICES- AND YOUR OF COURSE INTERESTED IN AND GETTING OUT OF THE DETENTION CENTER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE THAT THE UNITED STATES IS TAKING THAT APPROACH- TO SIMPLY DETAIN IMMIGRANTS THERE. NO REASON TO DO THE ESPECIALLY FOR US I'M YEARS THEY'RE SEEKING FOR. AND FLEE FOR A BI TEMPER. FROM THEIR HOME BUT JEFF OTHERS CONTINUED RECEIVE THESE. EVERY DAY- AND DO OUR BEST TO YOU KNOW. REPRESENT FOLKS AND BOND AND HEARINGS AND ROLL THEM OUT OF THIS. GIVEN THE EGREGIOUS AND HORRIFIC CONDITIONS OF THE FACILITY- AT TEN MESA. THANK YOU AND I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION IF I MAY UM EARLIER I HAD ASKED BECAUSE I HAD HEARD ABOUT THE- HUNDRED AND SIXTY CASES AND THE DETENTION CENTERS BUT- I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT- INFORMATION I WAS RELEASED I BELIEVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS. GOING TO ALLOW IRAQ I THINK OVER A HUNDRED- CHILDREN TO BE RELEASED AND THERE IS CONFUSION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO BE RESET THEIR PARENTS. OR ALONE DO YOU HAVE INFORMATION ON WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THOSE THAT ARE GOING TO BE RELEASED. YES YEAH MY UNDERSTANDING IS ABOUT LARGELY APPLIES TO FAMILY DETENTION CENTERS FORTUNATELY THERE ARE NO NO FAMILY DETENTION CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA- BUT THAT REALLY UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE. OF THE- INVESTMENT THE STATE'S CONTINUED INVESTMENT INTO THE SAN DIEGO RESPITE. SHELTER FOR MIGRANT FAMILIES ON BECAUSE THERE IS NO FAMILY DETENTION CENTER- INDIVIDUALS. FAMILY UNIT SPECIFICALLY ARE ABLE TO BE RELEASED ON THE ALTERNATIVES TO DETENTION PROGRAM SO THAT THEY ARE NOT DETAINED- FAMILY DETENTION CENTERS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES- IN ORDER TO GET TO THEIR FINAL DESTINATION SO. I'M WELL WE DO NOT HAVE TO SPECIFICALLY DEAL WITH- BEING DETAINED IN OUR IN OUR- REGION OR OUR STATE. I'M IT IS SOMETHING THAT OTHER. STATES ARE GRAPPLING WITH- BECAUSE THERE ARE FAMILY DETENTION CENTERS THERE NAMELY INTACT. THANK ONE MORE A FIGHT ALREADY LAY IS THAT OKAY.

I YOU KNOW IN IN IN THE RECESS I MEAN I GUESSTIMATE SOME FORMAL COMMENTS- BUT I DON'T WANT TO FOCUS ON THOSE FROM A COMMON SIGHT I WANT TO BRING BACK. SIR THE BIGGER PICTURE THE SITUATION THAT'S HAPPENING HERE IN THE IMPERIAL VALLEY- FOR FOUR DECADES- I KNOW I'VE BEEN AROUND FOR TWENTY YEARS AND WE HAVE BEEN POUNDING ON THE DOOR OF THE LEGISLATURE TO RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT WE ARE AN INTERCONNECTED COMMUNITY WHEN MEXICO. WE HAVE A FLUID- RELATIONSHIP- WHERE THERE IS A CONVENIENCE OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS ARE WORKING ARE YOU CENTURY JOBS ARE ARE I AGRICULTURE OUR MANUFACTURING- RETAIL OR WHOLESALE. WE ARE INSIDE COMMUNITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA HAS HAS NOT RECOGNIZE THAT IN WHETHER IT BE THROUGH LEGISLATION WHETHER IT BE TO HELP THEIR FIRST I HAS NOT RECOGNIZE THAT INDIVIDUAL THE WORST POSSIBLE CONDITIONS THAT WE CAN BE IN RIGHT NOW. WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT UNDERLYING CONDITIONS WE CAN I JUST FIGHT THE BATTLE- AT THE FRONT LINES- WHEN THE AGENTS HAVE ALREADY REACHED THE WORST POSSIBLE SCENARIO WHICH EMERGED. CARE TO ALL ACTIVE OF NOT PROACTIVE WE WILL NEVER ENDS I MEAN WHAT WAS THE LAST TIME WE WERE ABLE TO YOU READY KATE- EIGHT EIGHT IN AND THAT'S RIGHT BY YOU READY KIDDING ONE I'M NOT IT'S TIME. AND THAT THIS IS A PRIME BREEDING GROUND FOR HOPE IT ARE THE INEQUITIES THAT EXISTS HERE WE HAVE ASSAULTS AND SEE WE HAVE THE NEW RIVER WHICH IS A BREEDING GROUND. FOR THESE TYPES OF VIRAL CONDITIONS THAT HAVE EXISTED HERE IF WE DON'T LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE IF WE JUST TAKING CARE OF THE EMERGENCY WE'RE ONLY GONNA CONTINUE TO CARE FOR THE MOST. CRITICALLY ILL AND WE'RE NOT BE ABLE TO COPE. AND BE ABLE TO STOP THIS CRY. IN TIME. BEFORE IT SOME. SOME SICK. DAMAGE IN A COMMUNITIES WE DEFINITELY NEED AND I RECIPROCATE EVERYTHING ARE LEADERS IN HEALTHCARE HAVE BEEN SAYING- WE NEED YOU KNOW A PERSONAL. PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT P. P. WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS WE SEND LETTERS AND BELIEVE OFF FOR FOUR MONTHS AGO TO OUR CONGRESSMEN WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR A MEETING. BUT THESE ARE THINGS THAT THAT HAS BROUGHT TOGETHER OUR COMMUNITIES. EVEN AMONG NONTRADITIONAL PARTNERSHIPS SUCH AS A FARM BUREAU. WHO STEPPED IN AND SAID WE RECOGNIZE THAT BORDER AND WE RECOGNIZE THE FARMWORKERS AND THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS THAT ARE UNPROTECTED. AND WE NEED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JUST STEPPED IN I'VE BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO SEE A- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEING VERY RESPONSIVE. AND I SEE. IN THE BACK UP. WHAT WE COULD NOT BE IN BETTER HANDS IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE GOVERNOR THE HAS BEEN RESPONSES BUT WE NEEDED GIVEN THE ENTIRE ACCOUNT AND WE NEED THE LEGISLATURE TO SEE THE WHOLE PICTURE AND THE WHOLE PICTURE IS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THESE INEQUITIES AND EAST PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS THERE ARE PUTTING OUR ENTIRE POPULATION AND WE'RE SEEING THE RESULTS. THE RESULTS OF THE SPIKE IS IN THE CONDITION SINCE EIGHTY EIGHT IS IT'S NOT TO THE JUST POINT AT THE VICTIM BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS A BIG. EVERYBODY WHO LIVES HERE WHETHER YOU HAVE. BEEN AWARE THAT YOU'RE REDUCED. RATE IT HIGHER HIGHER- RESTORE CODE IS YOUR BEING PUT IN A IN IN THESE CONDITIONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ADDRESSED FOR A VERY LONG TIME. SO WHAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW- I YOU KNOW I'VE GOT TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO WORK WITH MUCH OF MY MANY OTHER BUREAUCRACIES HAD. A LONG HISTORY WORKING WITH C. P. H. IN AND NICE AND SHERRY- CONGRATULATE. THE NEW DIRECTOR IN HER IN HER APPOINTMENT THIS LAST FRIDAY BUT- THE STATE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC OUT PASSED. IN OFFICE OF EQUITY IN THIS IS WORK THAT THE LEGISLATURE DID. WE WANT THAT PROMISE OF THAT. EQUITY IN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMUNITY ANY READY KATIE. ALL THESE BE EXISTING CONDITIONS. ARE YOU KNOW ALL THE SEARCHERS SOCIALLY GERMANS I HELP. THE BARRIERS THAT EXIST THERE IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUST HAVE A TWO WAY COMMUNICATION BETWEEN EMERGENCY CARE AND WE IN BEING REACTIVE. WE HAVE A LOT OF NONPROFITS HERE IN THE VALLEY THAT HAVE BEEN HERE THAT HAVE. BEEN FILLING THE GAPS OF SERVICE FOR DECADES UPON DECADES I DECISION AS BEEN HERE FOR THIRTY YEARS THIRTY OVER NEARLY THIRTY FIVE YEARS. WE HAVE ORGANIZATIONS YEAR I'VE BEEN HERE MUCH LONGER AND I HAVE NOT SEEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STEP UP. AND SAY LET'S PULL IN ALL THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE THERE PROVIDING HEALTHCARE PROVIDE SOCIAL SERVICES FOOD SERVICES- MANY SERVICES THAT WE NEED. SO THAT WE CAN ALSO TAKE THIS STRATEGY TO BE PROACTIVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES MAKING SURE WE'RE REACHING. THE HARD TO REACH I HAVE SEEN THIS STRATEGY SO MANY TIMES. WHERE THE STATE BUREAUCRACY JUST LOOKS AS FAR AS ARE THERE THERE ARE IN IN SEAT. AND THEN THEY FOCUS IN AND THESE STATEWIDE STRATEGIES IN THE REGIONAL STRATEGIES. AND YOU KNOW WE ARE- WE SURCHARGE SOLITARY ROSE THIS IS A- YEAH WILL AND- YOU DON'T. BUT BUT WE NEED THE STATE. EIGHT OUR LOCAL WE'VE BEEN HAVE MANY GO HERE IN THE COUNTY AND I VERY THAT SOME OF THE COUNTY. I REALLY STEPPING UP AND RAKE IN AND THE FACT THAT OWN POLICIES HAVE BEEN RE OVER A YEAR AGO THESE ARE HI PA THAT THAT THAT THAT WERE HEALTH TO ELEVATE IN IN THE OF THE THAT ECSTASY BUT WE FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE OVER 85% LATINOS IN AND WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN IN IN NOT GETTING A COMPLETE COUNTY COULD EASILY BE OVER 90% AT THE MOST. AND BY THE WAY KOBE IS. IS HAVING HIS GREATEST DAMAGE AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR LATINOS- COMMUNITIES AND THIS IS THE PRIMARY IN ROUND FOR THE POOR QUALITY. RIGHT SO. IN WHAT IS A THING SAID THAT WE NEED WE TO SAY THAT. TO NOT ONLY JUST COORDINATE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL WE NEED TO ENGAGE ALL THE NONPROFIT THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO GO OUT. AND RETOOL FOR YEARS USE THESE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE THERE THAT HAVE BEEN THE STATE THE NARROWNESS STATION I'VE BEEN CAUGHT YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR WE NEED TO PUT RESOURCES IN THEIR HANDS. SO THAT WE CAN REACH THE POPULATION THAT THAT THAT SOME SOME HAVE CHOSEN TO SAY IT'S THEIR FAULT IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T WEAR THEIR MASS IS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT LISTENING LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE FARM WORKERS. THEY HAVE TO BUILD THIS TYPE OF RESISTANCE IN STATE BECAUSE OF THE WORKING CONDITIONS BECAUSE OF THE EXPOSURE THAT THEY FACED YOU THINK THAT THEY'RE SCARED OF A VIRUS. THEY DON'T THEY HAVE BEEN THEY HAVE BEEN. CONDITION TO DEAL WITH VERY HARSH CONDITIONS. SO WHEN WE WANT TO TALK TO THE COMMUNITY IN THE FARM WORKERS THEY FEEL THAT THIS IS JUST ANOTHER CALL IS GOING TO PASS THEM BY AND THAT'S NOT A FAILURE OF THEIRS. THAT'S THE FAILURES OF THE CONDITIONS. THAT THEY HAVE BEEN PUT TO AND THE FACT THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- BENEFITS. THESE KNEE SO LEASES. WERE YET IS NOT PROVIDING AND RESOURCE THEY NEED. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TAKE A STEP BACK. THE GENIE RESPONDER HOSPITALS AND BY THE WAY I WANT TO SAY THAT EVERY LUIS I WANT TO CONGRATULATE HIM BECAUSE- HE IS A LEADER THAT IS NOT AFRAID OF BEING IN NON PROFITS INTO HIS SPACE. AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE FORMAL AGREEMENTS WORKING IN YEARS COPPER AND WE NEED MORE OF THAT. AS WELL AS IS AND THE COUNTY OF IMPERIAL BRING IN NONPROFIT INTO THEIR SPACE. AFTER GREAT SPECULATED FOR THAT HE STOPPED ON MODELS I'M NOT GOING TO WORK HERE. SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BRING AL NONPROFITS. RITUAL THEM. RESPOND THEM. AND GET THEM ON THE COMMUNITY SO THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. IN THIS IS A MESSAGE TO THE LEADERS OF THESE. AND YOU NEED TO GET YOUR TEAM THE BUREAUCRATS THE BUREAUCRACY. TO CONNECT TO OUR ORGANIZATIONS TO CONNECT TO OUR COMMUNITIES. WE KNOW THIS. VERY WELL WE KNOW THE CONDITIONS WE LIVE IN WE KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE. SO WE NEED A TAX TO TACKLE CHECK THIS THAT THIS SITUATION FROM BOTH. FROM FROM BOTH ENDS MEET MERGES YOU CARE. PROVIDE HIM ALL THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. AND LET'S GET OUT IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THE HIGHER REGION AND ANY RADIC A. B. C. INEQUITIES THAT EVERY EXIST AND A HALF BAKED OUR COMMUNITIES FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THANK YOU CENTER I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS I HAVE SUBMITTED. COMMENTS AND I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE MANY ADVOCATES THAT HAVE BEEN MORE- IN COLLISIONS THAT WERE BORN OUT OF THIS CRISIS HERE. NOT BLOODY SO THAT I WHEN I SAID WE MEAN IS THAT WHEN YOU DIE YOU.

AND THANK YOU CENTER FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. I AND I ECHO EVERYTHING THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID ALL THE EXPERTS ARE. ABLE. THEY SHOWED THE CONDITIONS.

AND I THINK IT'S AN&lt;/c&gt; IMPORTANT MESSAGE SO WE WANT TO SEND TO THE LEADERSHIP HERE. NOT ONLY THE SENATE OF THE ASSEMBLY AND OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND ALL THE DEPARTMENTS. THAT THERE ARE. CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AT THE BORDER THAT ARE ARE CAUSING RISE TO THESE INCIDENTS AT ALARMING RATES AND THAT IS BECAUSE- THERE THERE IS JUST A SUCH A- BUT THE AMAZING INTEGRATION OF THE BORDER COMMUNITIES MEXICO IN CALIFORNIA ARE INTERTWINED IN SO MANY COMPLEX WAYS. REAL COUNTY IS THE SALAD BOWL OF CALIFORNIA AND- THEY THEY PRODUCE JUST A ON AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF AN IMPORTANT INGREDIENTS THAT WE ALL CONSUME AS AS A CONSUMERS. AND WE NEED IMPERIAL COUNTY AND A WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE IS- IS VERY DANGEROUS TO ALL CALIFORNIA'S PUBLICHEALTH ESPECIALLY IF IT INTERRUPTS THE PRODUCTION OF MANY IMPORTANT FOOD SOURCES FOR OUR STATE SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. ONE ASK A CENTER GONZALEZ DID YOU WANNA MAKE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS OR ANYTHING OR IN PARTICULAR. THANK YOU SENATOR WEST- AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE PANEL PANELISTS AS WELL THIS IS BEEN A VERY- VERY GOOD- HEARING ON THESE VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC AND SO- I JUST WANT TO REITERATE A FEW THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE BUT THE PROGRESS ON A SPECIFIC READ. IS A- COUPLE OF THE PANELISTS CAN SPECIFICALLY WHAT THEY NEED AND- I HOPE WITH IN OUR FOLLOW UP TOGETHER JOINTLY THAT WE CAN PROVIDE A MEMO THAT REALLY PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION TO. PUT UP TO BOTH HOUSES IN ADDITION GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO ENSURE THAT WE GET THOSE NEEDS MET. AND TIMELY MANNER- I WILL ALSO REITERATE THE ICE DETENTION CENTERS AND- FEDERAL DETENTION CENTER ALTHOUGH THAT OUTSIDE PURVIEW I KNOW THAT MANY THESE COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE ARE BEING TRANSPLANT UP I- SHE'S. GETTING TO HER IN A- COMMUNITY MEMBERS GOING THESE FACILITIES I HAVE LARGE- POSITIVE CASES WHICH IS NOT A YOU KNOW AND MANY OF OUR THOUGHTS. NOT A GOOD SPACE FOR THEM TO- CONTINUE LIVING AND SO AT SOME POINT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AND WORK VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER WITH THEM- BUT LASTLY I JUST WANTED TO ASK ABOUT THE TESTING CAPACITY BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT HAD BEEN LIGHTLY TOUCHED AND- ALTHOUGH- RIGHT NOW I THINK THE STATE IS MADE THAT A HUNDRED THOUSAND TESTS PER DAY. SIX AND THERE IS AREAS I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S ANY DATA IN THE IMPERIAL SAN DIEGO COUNTY AREA RELATED TO A SYMPTOMATIC. OF PEOPLE BECAUSE WE DON'T HEAR ENOUGH ABOUT IT IN A SYMPTOMATIC ESPECIALLY THE YOUNGER POPULATIONS. THAT ARE- JUST SPREADING THE VIRUS SO- IF THERE IS ANYONE ON THE PANEL THAT CAN ANSWER THAT THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL AND THEN LASTLY I HAVE BY WILL SAY. IN OUR FIRST HEARING FOR THE PANDEMIC AGENCY MONTHS WE'D BE CONNECTED WITH DR STEVE CORNEAS FROM CST. UP AND I'D BE HAPPY. TO ENSURE THAT SENATOR WHAT OFFICE HAS HIS INFORMATION BECAUSE HE HAS HIS OWN TESTING INCREASING AND IS SYMPTOMATIC DATA AS WELL SO. I'LL LEAVE IT THERE THINK- WE HAVE MISTER MIDDLE DO YOU ARE YOU PRIVY TO ANY OF THE INFORMATION SHE REFER. TO DURING THE A STRAIGHT. YEAH I DON'T HAVE THE TO PROVIDED DETAIL WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHAT I DO HAVE IS- I DEFINITELY AGREE WE WILL ONLY HAVE LIMITED TEST SITES- I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT THAT SEVERAL MONTHS AGO- LOCAL PRIVATE DOCTORS WERE THE FIRST TO GO OUT AND DO. THESE TRACKING CLINICS THEY DID NOT HAVE THE P. B. ON HAND AND WE MADE SURE THAT WE WORK WITH THAT- YES WE CHEN REFERRED US TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC OUT WHICH DâN MUNICH EIGHTY TO THE COUNTY PUBLIC OUT. THE THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A MUCH BROADER STRATEGY THAT WE ARE NOT MISSING OPPORTUNITIES SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN DOING TESTS FOR QUITE A FEW MONTHS BEFORE THE STATE AND BEFORE BUT COUNTY GOT MUTUAL THEM TO ACTUALLY GO OUT AND DO THEIR- BUT- I. IN THE WE HAVE YES BUT WE. MORE TO. LOW IT GO BACK WHAT I MENTIONED LEAST. ASIAN TRANSPORTATION. YOU KNOW WE STILL HAVE ABOUT AREAS AND GET THE END OUT TO PEOPLE NON NOT GETTING THE INFORMATION TO SUCH MEDIA WE NEED TO GO OUT THERE DORA BE ABLE TO AND SOCIAL DISTANCE SEEMS. AND MANY DIFFERENT TO REACH THE TO REACH BOB SO IT'S THE JOY STRAT THAT WE NEED NOT ONLY TO HAVE MORE JESSE SIZE BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE MANY DEATHS INSIDE BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO CATION YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THAT THE FAMILY SHOULD BE ABLE AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY WANT BE ABLE NO YES AFTER THE MAN EARLIER THE RECENT. WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE SITUATION HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WHERE A FIRED HALF OF FIVE FIVE TO TEN MILES AWAY FROM THE EMERGENCY CENTER AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT- ALONG WITH THE COUNTY IS ACTUALLY THE COUNTY IDENTIFIED THERE'S TRANSPORTATION IS NOW TRYING TO SOLVE THAT WHERE THE COUNTIES ARE CHECKING WITH OUR TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT TO TRY TO PROVIDE THAT TRANSPORTATION BUT THAT IS EXACTLY. THE ONLY WITH RIGHT. SO YES WE NEED MORE TESTING WE NEED MORE SUPPORT. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO RETOOL AND I'M GLAD I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY SAID YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE ASKED AND YOU KNOW WE NEED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO START WITH. LET'S GET THESE DOLLARS INTO LAW THESE NONPROFITS WE NEED TO HELP THE COUNTY CAN DO IT ALONE WE ALL RECOGNIZE NONE OF US IN THE LONG WE NEED TO DO IT TOGETHER.

OF THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT THEY ARE SUBJECT TO STATE REGULATION IN ADDITION TO HAVE THE EXPLICIT AUTHORITY. TO REGULATE AND INSPECT THE CONDITIONS INSIDE THE FACILITIES EXPLOSIVELY UNDER AB ONE OH THREE. INTERNET GENERAL HAS THE RIGHT.
