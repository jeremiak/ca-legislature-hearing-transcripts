OKAY ALL RIGHT- SO WE'LL MOVE ON FROM THERE ARE TO OUR DISCUSSION ITEMS AND WILL BEGIN WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE AND THE BUDGET CONDITION FROM THE L. A. O. THIS BILL ARE YOU HER WITH US GOOD MORNING GOOD AFTERNOON I SHOULD SAY GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS JENNY BELLOW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE WERE ASKED TO START OFF THE HEARING TODAY WITH A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF OUR INITIAL TAKE OF THE GOVERNORS MAY REVISION PROPOSAL. WHICH WE ACTUALLY JUST PUBLISHED YESTERDAY. THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE GOVERNORS MAY REVISION ARE LAID OUT IN YOUR AGENDA ON THE FIRST ISSUE. AND OUR OFFICE IS REALLY NEAT EARLY STAGES OF ANALYZING PROPOSALS IN THE COMING DAYS AND WEEKS WE'LL BE WORKING WITH THE FACT COMMITTEE AT OUR THINKING ON THEM. CONTINUES TO EVOLVE. FOR TODAY WHEN THE SUB COMMITTEE IS DISCUSSING THE INDIVIDUAL PROPOSALS WOULD PREFER WE WILL BE PROVIDING SOME. MARKETING COMMENTS ON SOME OF THE PROPOSALS REALLY FOCUSING ON OUR KEY QUESTIONS AND ISSUES THAT ARE GUIDING OUR ANALYSIS AT THIS TIME. SO AGAIN YESTERDAY OUR OFFICE DID PUBLISH OUR INITIAL COMMENTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION WHICH REALLY FOCUSES ON THE OVERALL STRUCTURE AND CONDITION OF THE BUDGET. AND THAT REPORT HAD SEVERAL KEY FINDINGS WHICH I WILL HIGHLIGHT A HIGH LEVEL HERE TODAY. THE FIRST IS THAT AS A RESULT OF EXTRAORDINARY REVENUE GROWTH OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WE ESTIMATE THE GOVERNOR HAD FIFTY TWO BILLION AN OVERALL GENERAL FUND SURPLUS TO ALLOCATE IN THE REVISION. THE LARGEST CATEGORIES OF SPENDING FROM THE OVERALL GENERAL FUND SURPLUS. ARE FOR NATURAL RESOURCES AND TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS AND THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE ONE TIME OR TEMPORARY IN NATURE OF 95% ACTUALLY. THE NEXT MAJOR THING WEFOUND IS THAT THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT FOR THE SOUTH CONTINUES TO BE A CONSTRAINT ON THE BUDGET. I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THE MECHANICS OF THE SOUTH TODAY BUT IF IT IS ACTUALLY LIMITS HOW THE STATE CAN USE. REVENUES THAT CUTS THAT IT COLLECTS THAT EXCEED A CERTAIN LIMIT AND WHEN THOSE REVENUES EXCEED THAT LIMIT WE HAVE A CELL REQUIREMENT AND THE STATE HAS TO SPEND THOSE REVENUES ON CERTAIN ACTIVITIES. EXAMPLES OF THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT THE REVENUES MUST BE SPENT ON INCLUDE TAX REDUCTIONS OR REFUNDS OR PROPOSALS THAT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE EXCLUDED. AND THOSE THAT- INCLUDE SUCH THINGS AS EMERGENCY SPENDING CAPITAL OUTLAY OR FLEXIBLE- DIMENSIONS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. IT'S BECAUSE OF THESE CONSTRAINTS THAT WE SPEAK ABOUT WHAT WE SEE IN THE MAY REVISION AS THAT IT SPENDS. THIRTY NINE BILLION OF THE SURPLUS ON PROPOSALS THAT MEET THE STATE APPROPRIATION REQUIREMENTS THIS IS ABOUT 66% OF THAT OVERALL SURPLUS BEING SPENT ON THOSE. PROPOSALS THAT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS. THE TWO LARGEST CATEGORIES OF THOSE PROPOSALS ARE ELEVEN POINT FIVE. BILLION FOR TAX REFUNDS AND ABOUT TWENTY TWO BILLION FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY. SO ALTHOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION MEETS THE SOUTH REQUIREMENTS ACROSS TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. OUR ANALYSIS FINDS THAT THE GOVERNOR DOES LEAVE THREE POINT FOUR BILLION AND AN ADDRESS OUR REQUIREMENTS IN THE BUDGET YEAR SO IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND ALTHOUGH THIS LEVEL OF AN ADDRESS SALAS IS RELATIVELY SMALL. THE SALAS REALLY CONSIDERED ON A TWO YEAR BASIS SO YOU HAVE TO ALSO THINK ABOUT IT WITH TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. AND IN THAT YEAR WE ESTIMATE THE STATE WOULD FACE AN ADDITIONAL SAU REQUIREMENTS OF OVER TWENTY BILLION. WITH ONLY A SURPLUS THAT YEAR ESTIMATED AT ONE POINT SIX BILLION. YOU'D BE IN A POSITION WHERE YOU HAVE A CELL REQUIREMENTS OF OVER TWENTY FIVE BILLION IN THAT YEAR AND A SURPLUS THAT IS FAR TOO SMALL TO PAY FOR IT. FINALLY ALTHOUGH IT IS REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHEN THE NEXT RECESSION WILL OCCUR. THERE ARE CERTAIN ECONOMIC INDICATORS. THAT WE MONITOR THAT HAS HISTORICALLY OFFERED SOME WARNING SIGNS THAT A RECESSION IS ON THE WAY. AND MANY OF THOSE ARE INDICATING A HEIGHTENED RISK A RECESSION IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. BUT AGAIN NOT POSSIBLE THERE'S REALLY NO CERTAINTY AND FORECASTING. AND AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THESE FACTORS IN OUR REPORT WE RECOMMEND INCREASING THE LEVEL OF RESERVES AFTER PARENTS THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION. WE FIND THAT THESE ADDITIONAL RESERVES WILL HELP THE STATE EITHER ADDRESS THOSE FUTURE SELL REQUIREMENTS. OR WILL HELP AND IF THERE IS A BUDGET PROBLEM THAT RESULTS FROM A FUTURE RECESSION. BEFORE WE TRANSITION TO HEAR AN INDIVIDUAL MAY REVISION PROPOSALS FOR HUMAN SERVICES WE WANTED TO JUST MAKE ONE FINAL POINT. AND THAT'S THAT ALTHOUGH THE SOUR. REALLY DOES PRESENT SIGNIFICANT CONSTRAINTS AND REALLY DOES NEED TO BE AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION FOR THE BUDGET THIS YEAR. WE RECOGNIZE THAT YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE SOME AUGMENTATIONS AS PART OF THE BUDGET THAT DO NOT MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS. AND IN THESE CASES WE REALLY RECOMMEND ASSESSING WHETHER THE- INTENTIONS MEET JUST A COUPLE CRITERIA. FIRST THEY REALLY SHOULD BE THOSE PROPOSALS THAT ARE OF HIGHEST PRIORITY TO THE LEGISLATURE. THEY SHOULD ALSO BE FULLY DEVELOPED YOU KNOW READY TO GO READY TO BE IMPLEMENTED. AND THEY SHOULD ADDRESS UNKNOWN NEED- AND THE FUNDING SHOULD NOT BE MORE THAN WHAT IS REASONABLY EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO BE SPENT- IN IN THE BUDGET YEAR. YOU COULD ALSO CONSIDER PROPOSALS THAT HAVE OTHER SECONDARY BENEFITS SUCH AS THE ABILITY TO DRIVE DOWN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING. THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE CRITERIA WE SUGGEST AS YOU CONSIDER AND WEIGH THE MERITS OF AUGMENTATION PROPOSALS AND IS. NOW CONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENT. I THAT CONCLUDES MY OVERVIEW OF OUR INITIAL REACTION TO THE GOVERNOR'S. MAYOR VISION AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT THE OTHER PROPOSALS TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW IF THE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FROM IF IT IF THE TWO BIGGEST. AREAS. THAT WORD DEBT UP TO BEING SPENT FOR THE STAR RQUIREMENT IS TRANSPORTATION AND CLIMATE CHANGE IS THAT IS FOR THOSE AREAS THAT YOU WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THE REDUCTIONS IN. AND MORE INTO. WELL AND THEN THE CHALLENGE HERE IS THAT- AT THEIR OFTEN THAT THE LARGER AUGMENTATIONS ARE THERE BECAUSE THEY ARE ALSO IN THOSE XXL EXCLUDABLE CATEGORIES THE EXTENT YOU DO NOT DO A PROPOSAL THAT IS ALREADY YOU KNOW AT A PROPOSAL THAT HELPS US MEET THIS HOUR REQUIREMENT- YOU YOU ASK IT REALLY DOESN'T HELP US WITH THE OVERALL CELL- CONSTRAINT NUMBER OKAY. TWO OTHER AREAS OKAY THANK YOU THANK GOODNESS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND- I DID HAVE A QUESTION SO WHAT ARE YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS COURSES ARE RECOMMENDING CREASING RESERVES- MY UNDERSTANDING IS RESERVES ACTUALLY- STILL COUNT TOWARD THE LIMIT. OTHER PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT- SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE MAY REVISE THE GOVERNOR IS NOT PROPOSING TO INCREASE THE SAFETY NET RESERVE WHICH WE ESTABLISHED- TO GAN BUFFER AGAINST RECESSION- WHICH TENDS TO THIS PORSCHE FACTOR STATE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. SO WE PUT MORE MONEY ASIDE INTO- THE LET'S SAY SAFETY NET RESERVE SO MAKING A RECOMMENDATION INCREASING RESERVES. AND THEN WE END UP SPENDING IS DOWN RECESSION HITS COULD YOU TALK ABOUT INCREASING RECESSION RISK AND THEY'LL LET WE ALSO INFLATION BY THE WAY THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. THEN IF THAT MONEY IS PUT INTO RESERVE IT COUNTS STILL COUNTS AGAINST THE LIMIT AND THEN WE SPEND THAT MONEY BECAUSE THERE'S NOW INCREASING CASELOAD OR OTHER TYPES REASONS IS THAT TELL A GALLON AGAINST THE SPENDING LIMITS BUT SINCE WE RE ALLOCATE RESERVE SO CAN. YOU HELP ME CLARIFY- THAT IS IT BETTER TO PUT INTO THE SAFETY NET RESERVE IS A BETTER TO PRE APPROPRIATE IT'S- MEAN. WHAT TO WHICH WE DO TO BE SURE WE CAN ACTUALLY. MAINTAIN A LEVEL SERVICE ESPECIALLY IF CASELOADS INCREASE- IS UNFORTUNATELY USUALLY DO IF THERE'S AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN FOR SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT WHAT'S THE BEST STRATEGY FOR TRYING TO DEAL WITH- GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A GOOD BUDGET THIS YEAR TO BE ABLE TO BUFFER. AGAINST ESSENTIALLY OUR COUNTER CYCLICAL. SPENDING WHEN IT COMES TO HUMAN SERVICES AND HEALTH LATER WHEN WE HAVE THAT HEARING LATER BUT WE CERTAINLY HERE AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE HUMAN SERVICES. SO YOU'RE CORRECT THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE MONEY IN THE RESERVES IT WOULD STILL COUNT TOWARDS- CELLS RIGHT SO IT IT'S NOT X. IT'S NOT EXCLUDABLE PIECE- WHAT IT REALLY DOES IT IT IT IT INSURES THAT WHEN YOU. HIT THAT ADDITIONAL SELL PRESSURE NEXT YEAR THAT WE'RE PREDICTING THAT YOU HAVE. THE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO POTENTIALLY PAY FOR AND SPEND ON THINGS THAT ARE EXCLUDABLE AT THAT TIME SO THAT'S REALLY. OF THE MECHANICS OF HOW IT WORKS- SO IT'S NOT THAT PUTTING IT IN THE RESERVE IS GOING TO COUNT TOWARDS MEETING A REQUIREMENT AT ALL. SO JUST TO CLARIFY SO WE PUT MORE MONEY INTO THE SAFETY NET RESERVE. AND THEN- LET'S SAY CASES INCREASE NEXT YEAR LET'S SAY THERE'S A I DON'T WISH THAT HAPPENS BUT IF THERE ISN'T ECONOMIC DOWNTURN NEXT YEAR THE YEAR AFTER. AND NOW WE'RE DRAWING DOWN FROM THAT SAFETY NET RESERVES. THIS SO IN TERMS OF THE CELL THE LIMIT DOES IT DOES IT BACK GET COUNTED TWICE ARE ONLY GET CAO ONCE BECAUSE AFTER ALL WE'RE THIS IS WE'RE NOW QUOTES SPENDING EVEN THOUGH WE'RE PUTTING INTO RESERVE AGAINST THAT NOW BY PUTTING INTO SAFETY NET RESERVE WE ACTUALLY DRAW DOWN ON THAT. AS THOSE EXPENDITURES FROM THE DRAWDOWN ACTUALLY. ALSO COUNT AGAIN OR IS IT LIKE NO YOU YOU YOU WERE COUNTED AGAINST THE LIMIT IN THIS YEAR THE FIRST TIME AND SO THAT IT DOESN'T COUNT AGAINST THAT WHEN WE ACTUALLY SEE. YOU KNOW. AND THAT ONE DURING THE DOWNTURN. YES NO IT'S A IT'S A GOOD QUESTION I'M GOING TO ACTUALLY TAKE IT BACK THE MECHANICS THAT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU THE RIGHT ANSWER I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT ONE BACK TO OUR CELL EXPERT ON THE EXACT ACCOUNTING WHEN YOU WOULD DRAW DOWN ON A RESERVE IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR. AND GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION OKAY THAT THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANCE WERE TRYING TO STRATEGIZE IS TO BEGIN TO TAKE A RECOMMENDATION INCREASING RESERVES. YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF WHAT SHOULD BE THE BEST STRATEGY. FOR US TO BE ABLE TO. DISTRIBUTE THE MONEY WHETHER IT'S PUTTING RESERVES OF FOR. IT YOU KNOW IN PREPARATION TO. FOUR EIGHT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WHERE YOU KNOW WE MAY HAVE AN INCREASE IN. DEMAND AND INDICATE A CASELOAD FOR OUR SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE KIND OF CUTS THAT LEAST I HAD EXPERIENCE MAKING. WHEN I FIRST CAME THE LEGISLATURE SO YOUR HELP AND ASSISTANCE IN ANALYZING THAT WOULD BE REALLY APPRECIATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU YOUR EXPERTISE AND I THINK WE ALL WE ALL READ THE YEAH- THE REPORT WE CAME OUT AND ARE ALWAYS A VERY IMPRESSED WITH HOW. HOW QUICK YOU CAN TURN AROUND. AND LOOK FORWARD TO US BEING ABLE TO. DIVE DEEPER INTO THE DETAILS AS WE- AS WE GO FORWARD.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH HELLO ANY COMMENTS. WHEN BRISTOW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING MAY REVISION AND WILL DEFINITELY REPORT BACK TO THAT SUB COMMITTEE- WITH ANY PARTICULAR FINDINGS BUT INCLUDED IN OUR ANALYSIS ONE THING THAT WE TYPICALLY LOOK INTO IS- ASSESSING WOULD BE ADMINISTRATIONS CASELOAD ESTIMATES ALSO CONDUCTING OUR OWN CASELOAD ESTIMATES- BUT CROSS DSS PROGRAMS INCLUDING CAO WORKS I JUST SAYS INVESTORS SCIENCES P. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE- CASELOAD ESTIMATES REALLY MAKE UP THE UNDERLYING COST ESTIMATES FROM WITHIN THE PROGRAMS AND THAT. PROPOSALS FROM THAT MAKE UP THE MAY REVISION- ONE EXAMPLE- THAT IS- RELATED TO THE- ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATE OF THE S. P. GRANT INCREASE- I'M INTENDED TO BE PROVIDE IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- I'M IN JANUARY IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT THE- THE GRANT INCREASE WOULD BE ABOUT A TWENTY FOUR PERCENT- IT TAKE EFFECT JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WITH THE COST US ABOUT BY. TWO BIASED S. S. P. S. ISIS BECAME SORT OF STUDENTS AND MAY EVEN RESTRICTIONS NOW ESTIMATING THAT THE ACTUAL GRANT INCREASE WILL BE ABOUT 20% SO SLIGHTLY LOWER- WHILE THE ACTUAL ISSUES BE GRANTED CREASE WON'T BE FINALIZED UNTIL NEXT YEAR- THIS IS JUST ANOTHER REASON WHY WE'RE LOOKING AT- CASELOAD- TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. THE ESTIMATES BEHIND EITHER BUDGET YEAR OR FUTURE. COSTS PROPOSALS- BUT THEN ALSO GETTING A BETTER SENSE OF- TRACKING WHAT THAT ACTUAL SP GRADING CREASE COULD BE AS WE'RE CONTINUING TO TRACK- FACTUAL CASELOADS AS THEY COME AND- AT THIS POINT I'M GOING TO TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE ANGELA SHORT TO PROVIDE COMMENTS ON CHILD WELFARE FOR POLLS. THANK YOU WELCOME A SHORT. THANK YOU AGAIN AND LET'S START WITH THE L. A- O. GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS JUST A FEW HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS ON SOME KEY AUGMENTATIONS- FOR CHILDREN'S PROGRAMS THESE ARE THE PROPOSAL'S DESCRIBED ON PAGE SEVENTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA. OVERALL BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY REVIEW WE DO FIND THAT THESE PROPOSALS ALIGNED WITH THE GOALS OF THE CHILD WELFARE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM- AND IN CONCEPT WOULD SUPPORT CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF OVER ARCHING CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM FUNCTIONING. SUCH AS ENSURING THAT SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF RESOURCE FAMILIES ARE APPROVED IN A TIMELY MANNER HAT EMERGENCY CARE GIVERS RECEIVE FUNDING WHILE COMPLETING RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL. AND THAT FOSTER USED CAN BE PLACED WITH RELATIVES AND FAMILY BASED SETTINGS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE WANT TO NOTE THAT THE CARE GIVER APPROVAL AUGMENTATION AND PLACEMENT PRIOR TO APPROVAL- AT PROPOSAL. WOULD PROVIDE AUGMENTATIONS IN AREAS WHERE WE PREVIOUSLY HAVE RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER ADDITIONAL FUNDING- THAT SET. UP WILL BE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE WE UNDERSTAND HOW THE SPECIFIC AUGMENTATION AMOUNTS WERE DETERMINED. AND WILL BE SURE TO RAISE ANY- QUESTIONS OR OR CONCERNS FOR THE LEGISLATURE AS WE CONTINUE OUR IF YOU. AND FINALLY JUST IMPOSING I WANTED TO KNOW WE HAVE- A FEW OTHER L. A. O. COLLEAGUES ON THE LINE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING- TOWERS CHILD CARE OTHER DSS PROGRAM AREAS- ALTHOUGH WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON THOSE AREAS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I ALSO SEE DIRECTOR JOHNSON HAS JOINED US OF THANK YOU DIRECTOR FOR BEING HERE AS WELL- BUT YET WE THINK THE L. A- ESPECIALLY LOOKING AT. THE PROJECTED CASELOAD BECAUSE WE KNOW. THEY HAVEN'T BEEN AS CONSISTENT DURING TO THE PANDEMIC WE HAVEN'T SEEN SOME OF THE RISES AND SOME OF THE AREAS THAT WE THOUGHT WE'D SEE AN- AND CERTAINLY INCREASES IN OTHER AREAS SO THAT'S I THINK GOING TO BE. VERY IMPORTANT. AND I TO THE L. A. O. OR MAYBE TO THE- DIRECTOR JOHN TONIGHT. MY PARTICULAR AREA OF INTEREST AND CONCERN IS- AROUND CHILD WELFARE AND SOME OF THE- SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO HIT AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE. THE RIGHT THE RIGHT PROBLEM IN THE RIGHT WAY AND IF WE NEED IF WE NEED SOME OF LEGISLATIVE ADJUSTMENTS ENABLED TO DO THAT- WITH THE- ENABLE TO GET KIDS OUT OF. THE RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS THAT HAS BEEN A BIT DIFFICULT AND ALSO I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIND LOVING. HOMES FOR KIDS WITH A LOT OF HIGH HIGH LEVEL VERY COMPLEX NEEDS AND WHILE THAT IS. A GREAT GOAL TO SHOOT FOR IT'S HARDER IN REALITY. SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO FIND- WHAT'S EXISTING AND WHAT WE CURRENTLY REQUIRE. IF THAT'S ACTUALLY THE BEST WAY THAT WE SHOULD BE GOING ABOUT DOING THINGS FOR THE KIDS- TORONTO IF DIRECTOR JOHNSON IF YOU JUST HAVE ANY INPUT IN INTO THAT ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT. I MEAN ARE WE JUST THROWING GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD TRYING TO MAKE. MAKE IT HOW WE HAVE IT STRUCTURED RIGHT NOW WORK OR DO WE NEED TO DO. SOMETHING DIFFERENT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SURE CAN JOHNSON CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND I WOULD I WOULD JUST ECHO AS I THINK BELIAU JUST NOTED THAT THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING IN MAY REVISION ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT WE CAN REACH THOSE OUTCOMES THAT WE KNOW. THAT RESULTS IN THE BEST OF FOR OUR YOUTH IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM SO IT'S REALLY LOOKING AT THAT. ABILITY TO BOTH RECRUIT AND RETAIN THE AND HAVE LESS DESTRUCTION AND PLACEMENT FOR FOSTER YOUTH WITH THE- AT PACKAGE OF INVESTMENTS THAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU. ARE THAT THAT SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE FAMILY FINDING ENGAGEMENT AND SUPPORT COMPONENT- IS REALLY GEARED TO DO JUST THAT IT IS ALSO BASED ON SOME OF THAT HIGHLY YOU SEEN IN SOME COUNTIES THAT HAVE RESULTED IN THOSE OUTCOMES THAT WE ARE TRYING TO CHEAT SO AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE EVIDENCE. WE ARE ENGAGING OUT WEST USE THAT WITH THE COUNTY SPLITS THE ACTIVITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND PROVIDERS. ADDRESS THE PACKAGE OF INVESTMENT YOU HAVE FOR US TO REACH THOSE GOALS. AND OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE STRIVING TOWARDS TOGETHER. OKAY THANK YOU- WE WILL KEEP. WILL KEEP MONITORING THAT AND CERTAINLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. BUT APPARENTLY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- JUST MAYBE A FEW- JUST DETAILS TO ROUND OUT AB SO. UNDER THE CHILD WELFARE CHILDREN'S PROGRAM THE FINDINGS- FAMILY FINING ENGAGEMENT- I KNOW YOU PROPOSING UNDER FIFTY MILLION THE ONE TIME. UNDERSTANDS THAT AND IS THAT THE ONE WHERE YOU'RE REQUIRING A COUNTY MATCH AND CAN YOU MAYBE SPEAK TO THE REASON FOR THE COUNTY MATCH OURS I MEAN. SURE SURE CAN JOHNSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AT SENATOR YES WE ARE PROPOSING A COUNTY MATCH IN THIS. INVESTMENTS IN THAT SUIT FIRST I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE FAMILY FINDING ENGAGEMENT COMPONENT IS A CURRENT RESPONSIBILITY. AT THE COUNTIES ARE ENGAGED AND SO WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS BUILDING AND LEVERAGING AT THAT RESOURCE AND COMMITMENT I WITH THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING CHANGE IN SURE WE'RE UTILIZING AGAIN THE EVIDENCE AND THAT THE PARTNERS THAT WE HAVE THE SPACE TO HAVE. THAT RESULTED IN THE GREATEST OUTCOMES AND GOING FORWARD SO WE'RE LEVERAGING LOCAL MESSENGER DOESN'T OPTIONAL ADD PROGRAM FOR PARTICIPATION AS WE ARE PROPOSING OKAY AND- WILL THE DEPARTMENT BE MONITORING TO BE SURE WE DON'T ACTUALLY INCREASE DISPARITIES BETWEEN COUNTIES SO THERE MAY BE SOME COUNTIES WHO ARE WILLING TO PRIORITIZE AND INVEST MORE. IN FAMILY FINDING AND- GRADY COUNTIES THAT DON'T DO AS MUCH SO WITH THE MATCH. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD SEE GREATER DISPARITIES BETWEEN COUNTIES AND THEIR EFFORTS TO DO SO RIGHT. SO IS THAT SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT'S GONNA MONITORING SO THAT WE CAN. ENSURE THAT- BOSTROM ARE YOU KNOW OF. YOUTH WE'RE TRYING TO FIND TO PAY IT'S A ARE AT THAT- WILL THAT. WHERE WHICH COUNTY THEY'LL IN DOESN'T TO BE A- AND WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PLACE AND THE PLACE THEIR FAMILIES. ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION AND THAT AND WE HAVE A COMMITMENT TO DOING THAT SENATOR AND I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE- KIND OF FINDINGS IN THE AND THAT WORK IN WHICH WE ARE SEEING THOSE GREATEST OUTCOMES WILL BE SHARED ACROSS COUNTIES NO MATTER WHETHER R NOT THEY PARTICIPATE. IN THIS PARTICULAR INVESTMENT SO BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT POINT AN ABSOLUTELY PART OF OUR PROCESS OKAY ALL RIGHT SO I THINK JUST IMPORTANT TO MONITOR THAT- YEAH THE QUESTION ACTUALLY IS THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICE THE- CALIFORNIA MADE RESPONSE STATEMENT. WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS A- FOR RED YOU KNOW. TECHNOLOGY APPLE- IS THAT SOME OF MONEY ACTUALLY FOR THE ACTUAL. IMPLEMENT THOSE AS DESIGN DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION SO I JUST WANNA CLARIFY SO ARE WE GETTING FOR OUR MONEY IS OVER GETTING A NEW SYSTEM IS JUST THE PLANNING PHASE. WHAT WHAT IS IT THAT WERE ACTUALLY PAYING THE HUNDRED EIGHT MILLION FORCE DO WE GET A NEW USE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION FOR THIS ISSUE OR IS THAT ONLY PART OF THE- COST. YES SENATOR AGAIN JIM JOHNSON THE DEPARTMENT ADVANCED AT THE FUNDING THAT WE NEED AT IN LINE WITH OUR LATEST SPECIAL PROJECTS FIVE ESTIMATE FOR THIS PROJECT SO. THAT I THINK TOWARDS THAT THE CREATION OF THAT NEW SYSTEM THAT'S CORRECT SO THE SUM OF MONEY. WHEN YOU COME BACK TO US AND SAID OKAY WE WERE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT WE HAVE THE SYSTEM IT'S UP AND RUNNING IT'S ADDRESS THAT'S THAT THAT'S THE SUM OF MONEY IT TAKES TO DO THAT THAT WE'RE ESTIMATING RIGHT NOW CORRECT. CORRECT OKAY ALL RIGHT JUST AS WELL BE SURE SITES IS ALWAYS NOT CLEAR WHAT. WHEN IT COMES TO TECHNOLOGY MONEY EXACTLY WHAT WE ACTUALLY. HOW MUCH WE'RE PAYING FOR- WHAT'S PAYING FOR SO- AND THEN- OKAY- AND THEN THE OTHER- AND I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IS IN TERMS OF. CHILD CARE AND STAND IN THE MAY REVISE- WELL I SEE THERE'S A CORRECTION ERROR IN THE PREVIOUS BUDGET. THERE'S NO THERE'S NO PROPOSAL TO INCREASE LOTS OR PAYMENT FOR CHILD CARE IN THE MAY REVISE AND- IT'S BEYOND THAT. THOSE PROPOSED IN THE JANUARY BUDGET. THERE'S ACTUALLY A PROPOSAL TO INCREASE OUR TOTAL COMMITMENT FOR BUDGET YEAR FIVE THIRTY SIX THOUSAND ADDITIONAL CHILDCARE SUBSIDIES FOR OKAY THAT'S A- YEAH. IT WOULD BRING THE TOTAL TO A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND. AT IN TOTALITY CURRENT YEAR LAST BUDGET YEAR AND THEN OF COURSE WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS THAT GOAL AND COMMITMENT TO EXPAND TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. MITCHELL TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SETS THESE BY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. OKAY SO THAT'S NEW FOR ME REVISED IN ADDITION TO US BECAUSE IN JANUARY OKAY ALL RIGHT. WANT TO CLARIFY OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT MANY OF THE PROPOSALS ARE- OUR TO OUR TIED TO BEING ABLE TO ACCEPT FEDERAL FUNDING. FOR A LOT OF PROGRAMS THAT EXISTS A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY IS ALSO ALIGNING OURSELVES WITH THE FEDERAL FOR POLICIES AND GUIDELINES TO BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE.

YES AND CHECK YOU PROCEED WITH L. A. L. ALLEN A PREVIEW MY- WE'RE STILL COMPLETING OUR INITIAL REVIEW OF THE MAY REVISE PROPOSAL SO WE'LL DEFINITELY GET BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE- BUT JUST ON THE CARE COURT PROPOSAL SOME. SOME COMMENTS ON THAT OUR OFFICE BLAGDON OTHER HEARING SPECIFICALLY ON THE JUDICIAL SIDE IS ONE- THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF BEIJING IS JUST ONE OF THREE PROPOSALS THAT MAKE UP THE CARE COURT PACKAGE AS- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTIONED. SO THE TOTAL COST RELATED TO CARE COURT- WHEN YOU SOME OF THE THREE PROPOSALS A SIXTY FIVE MILLION. AND ANOTHER THING THAT WE WOULD NOTICE THAT THESE DOLLARS- BUT SPECIFICALLY TIED TO A POLICY BILL THAT STILL MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS- SO KEY QUESTIONS THAT OUR OFFICE- IT'S CONSIDERING WHEN IT COMES TO THIS BROADER CARE CORP. IS ONE THAT. THE FUNDING RELATIVE TO THE BELL I'M TO GETTING A BETTER SENSE OF HOW DEPARTMENTS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING- WILL DEVELOP THAT EXPERTISE- TO SERVE- POPULATIONS- THAT WOULD- BE SERVED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CARE COURT PROCESS. AND GIVEN THAT THEY MAY HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS- THEN THE TYPICAL POPULATION THAT- THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING- CURRENTLY FOCUSES ON ALSO GETTING A BETTER SENSE OF THE TIMING- AND THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO DEVELOP THAT EXPERTISE AND ALSO- THE CAPACITY AND- THE- LEVEL OF RESOURCE. WITHIN EXISTING STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE LEVERAGED TO THE CARE COURT PROCESS TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL WRAPAROUND OR SUPPORT SERVICES- SUCH AS- IT SHOWS THAT WOULD PURCHASE THROUGH THE KERR CARCROSS. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL GET THIS A- COURSE ARE STILL LOT WORK TO DO ON THAT THAT WE DO KNOW AND TREATMENT. INNOVATION IN BEING ABLE TO- ADD TO DESIGNED AND FURNACE- THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. THANK YOU AND- YEAH WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY HERE PRESENTATION ABOUT CARE COURT AND THE BILL ACTUALLY AUTHORED BY OUR CHAIR HERE- AND THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH. I DID ONE DRILL DOWN A LITTLE BIT- SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE AND PART OF AGING- WELL I GUESS A COUPLE QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE CARE COURT FROM SO ONE YOU KNOW THERE I THINK SOME PEOPLE RAISE. THE ISSUE BUT HE MAYBE ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LACK EXPERIENCE THE PART OF AGING OR IS THERE SOME PARALLEL PROGRAM- DOES NOT BY THREE WORD BUT- THOSE THE CAPACITY OF THIS DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP. THE COURT SUPPORTER PROGRAMS OR SOMETHING SIMILAR TO DAVE HAD TO OVERSEE OR DEVELOP. YOU KNOW IS IT WITHIN THEIR DEPARTMENT SO THAT CAPACITY. AND THEN- REALIZING IT'S PART OF A LARGER PACKAGE BUT IS YOU KNOW THAT GIVEN THE IMPORTANT ROLE TO SUPPORTER PLAYS AT LEAST. IN THE NIGHT AND AT LEAST WHEN I. WAS LOOKING AT THE LEGISLATION. IS TEN MILLION ENOUGH- TO PROVIDE THE SUFFICIENT SUPPORT FOR THE SUPPORTERS AND THE OTHER TRAINING AT CETERA FOR THE SUPPORTERS- AND REMEMBER HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ANTICIPATING SO HOW MUCH. THEREFORE HAPPENED IS TO MEET A PERSON AT LEAST ONCE AS ONE SUPPORTERS THAT. THAT ENOUGH MONEY TO PROVIDE ENOUGH SUPPORT FOR THE SUPPORTER SO I CAN'T OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD- MEMBER EXACTLY HOW. WE DID THE MATH HELD AT TEN MILLION HOW MANY PER SUPPORTED LED. SO BUT MAYBE MORE IMPORTANTLY- AGAIN- IS THE PART OF AGING AB CERTAINLY IS WONDERFUL DEPARTMENT DOES A LOT OF THINGS CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHY THE DEPARTMENT AGING AND WHAT EXPERIENCE DEPARTMENT AGING AND SETTING UP A PROGRAM THAT. MILLER TO THE PURPOSE COURT SUPPORTER PROGRAM FOR CARE COURT DUFFY DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING- SO WHO DEPARTMENT OF AGING HAS SOME EXPERIENCE ESTABLISHING A PROGRAM LIKE THIS IF YOU LOOK TO OUR- NEWEST EFFORT THE OFFICE OF THE LONG TERM CARE PATIENT RAP. WE WORK WITH LOCAL PARTNERS TO PROVIDE- UNREPRESENTED INDIVIDUALS WITH REPRESENTATION FOR DECISION MAKING ON CARE TEAMS I'M ADDITIONALLY WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN OUR LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM- WORKING WITH- ADULTS IN INSTITUTIONS AND FACILITIES HOPING TO PROTECT AND SUPPORT THEIR RIGHTS- AND ALSO PROVIDING INFORMATION- SO WITH THOSE FEW. EFFORTS AND OFFICES THAT WE HAVE UNDER OUR PURVIEW WE THOUGHT- THAT WE COULD STEP IN AND COORDINATE AND WORK WITH LOCAL PROVIDERS THAT MAY BE INTERESTED- TO PROVIDE THE IN PROVIDING THE CARE COURT SUPPORT- WORK AT. THE LOCAL LEVEL AS WELL- OKAY APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER- I THINK THE POPULATION IS IN THE END THAT THEY THINK THE PART AGING DOES YOU KNOW A REALLY. GOOD JOB AND THOSE PROGRAMS YOU TALKED ABOUT SO THATS COURSE- HELPFUL. I DO THINK THE POPULATIONS A BIT DIFFERENT SO I DAY JUST URGE THAT THE- AGAIN WE WANT THIS TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND THUS THE SUPPORTERS ARE STILL SEEM TO BE A KEY PART OF THIS YOU KNOW POTENTIAL SUCCESS- HOPEFULLY OF THE CARE COURT SYSTEM. AND PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE SO- SO JUST WANNA BE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING ENOUGH SUPPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT AND WE HAVE TO BRING TOGETHER GREAT SKILL SETS TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE SUPPORTER PROGRAM BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY KEY AT LEAST THE WAY I READ THE- COURT PROPOSAL. GOING LIKE TO FOCUS ON THE COURT SIDE I'M LOOKING AT SUPPORTER SITE IS BEING A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF- WHETHER THIS IS GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL OR NOT AND- ONE BE SURE WE'RE NOT SKIMPING ON- UNVEILED SET UP A- A STRONG SUPPORTER SYSTEM FOR- FOR THE PEOPLE WHO. MAY HAVE TO GO BEFORE CARE COURT. UNDERSTANDING AND WE CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH- AGENCY ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS EFFORT- TO INFORM HOW WE DO THAT AND HOW WE CAN LEND OUR EXPERTISE TO ENSURING THE SUCCESS OF THE CARE COURTS SUPPORTER PROGRAM AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT COMMUNICATE. BOTH WITH THIS BODY AND OUR OTHER PARTNERS ON IMPLEMENTATION IF THIS MOVES FORWARD. OKAY ALL RIGHT I APPRECIATE THAT WELL WE'LL SEE WE'LL WATCH THE DEPARTMENT STRETCH OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I HAVE REACHED THE POINT IN A COUPLE DIFFERENT SETTINGS THAT. I THINK CASE I THINK CASELOADS ARE ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND- WILL CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH THE CASELOADS JUST IN CHILD WELFARE IN GENERAL. AS WE'RE MOVING AND DEVELOPING A NEW SSTEM OF CARE COURTS THAT THE RATIO. OF CASELOAD- BE MANAGEABLE. SOME OF THE NUMBERS I HEARD I THOUGHT WERE WAY TOO HIGH WAY TOO HIGH. BECAUSE I THINK THE SUPPORTERS GOING TO HAVE A MORE. HANDS ON RELATIONSHIP POTENTIALLY. DEPENDING ON THE DEMOGRAPHIC MIX IN THE- WHERE PEOPLE ARE LOCATED. IS GONNA NEED A LOT OF VARIATION I THINK TO- CASELOAD SO- LET'S LET'S NOT BE A WE KEEP ON THAT FRONT END AND END UP NOT HAVING A PROGRAM THAT WORKS VERY WELL BECAUSE IT'S NOT FUNDED.

THE MAYOR VISION INCLUDES SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING FOUR POINT ACROSS ME FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION OF THAT GENERAL FUND. TO SUPPORT PARTICIPANTS IN THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM BY AMENDING STATUTE TO MOVE THE COST OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SERVICES OUT OF PARTICIPANTS INDIVIDUAL BUDGET- BUT IT'S THIS POLICY HAS BEEN IN PLACE THROUGH DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR FOR THE DURATION OF THE PANDEMIC AND MAKING THIS POLICY PERMANENT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR CONSUMERS A SMALLER BUDGET.

CHANGES THAT CONTINUE SUSPENSION OF THE ANNUAL FAMILY FEE PROGRAM AND THE FAMILY BECAUSE PARTICIPATE PARTICIPATION PROGRAM IN STATUTE. THROUGH DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO ON BOTH. PROGRAMS HAVE ALSO BEEN SUSPENDED FOR DEPARTMENT DIRECTORS THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. THE PURPOSE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WOULD RECONSTITUTE THE PROGRAM'S HIGH 6100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL FROM THE CURRENT 4100% OF. FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL THRESHOLD AND ALSO TASK THE DIAZ REPORTING FOR A RECOMMENDED CARSHARING PROGRAM BY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BASE IN COLLABORATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS.

MAKES CHANGES TO THE TAYLOR DAY OUR PROGRAM SERVICE CO WHICH WILL NOW ALLOW CONSUMERS ACCESS THE SERVICE ALONGSIDE TRADITIONAL SERVICES AS A TURN BY INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM PLANS AND WOULD ALSO ELIMINATE THE HAVE BEEN DOING POLICY- I SPECIFY PROVIDERS. OTHER CHIU OF NOTE WE WOULD HIGHLY- THE NEW PROPOSED THREE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOUR DDS TO ALLOCATE TO THE CITY OF COSTA MESA IN ORANGE COUNTY TO ENGAGE IN A PLANNING PROCESS FOR DISPOSITION OF THE FAIRVIEW DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER ST. AND ALSO ON EMERGENCY PLANNING PREPAREDNESS FRONT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND I'M GOING TO CONTINUE DISTRIBUTION OF EMERGENCY GO BAGS AND BATTERIES- AND- AND OTHER ACTIVITIES- IN THIS CONTINUES INVESTMENTS MADE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. INCLUDING THE DESIGNATION OF EMERGENCY COORDINATORS AT REGIONAL CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE- AN INITIAL PROCUREMENT HAVE GO BAGS FOR CONSUMERS- IN AREAS OF THE STATE. ARE AT HIGH RISK. WILL THIS ASTERS- OTHER EMERGENCIES. IN WITH THAT. CAPITA TAKING QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISSPELLING. THANK YOU VENTURES ON YOUR MEDICAL THE L. A. O. AND WE ARE OF COURSE STILL REVIEWING A LOT OF THE DETAILS OF THESE VARIOUS PROPOSALS SO I'M GOING TO LIMIT MY COMMENTS TODAY TO THE BIGGEST PROPOSAL THE WORK FOR STABILITY PROPOSAL WHICH IS- WOULD COST A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND IN THE BUDGET FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY. I'M WE THINK THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO ADDRESS WHAT WE HAVE HEARD IS A BIG AND GROWING AND SORT OF IMMEDIATE- WORKFORCE. PROBLEM AND THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF THE PROPOSAL MAY HAVE MERIT THEY MIGHT HELP WITH THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM OR PERHAPS THEY WOULD HELP WITH WORKFORCE ISSUES IN THE FUTURE. BUT THAT IS- SORT OF UNCLEAR- TO OUR OFFICE UPON FIRST- FIRST REVIEW. AND IN ADDITION SORT OF GET AWAY OF MY COLLEAGUE- IS BELLA'S COMMENTS THAT IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT THIS YEAR- THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER PRIORITIZING- PROPOSALS THAT MEET OR EXCEED A HIGH BAR SO IN WHAT IN. SORT OF THAT CONTEXT I WANTED TO RAISE A FEW. OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE INITIALLY IDENTIFIED WITH THIS PROPOSAL. SO FIRST WE KNOW THAT THERE'S NO ASSOCIATED TRAILER BILL SO IT'S HARD IT'S HARD TO. KNOW HOW THESE PROPOSALS WOULD ACTUALLY BE IMPLEMENTED- SO LET ME START FIRST WITH THE- TRAINING COMPONENTS THE TRAINING STIPENDS IT'S UNCLEAR- TO US WHETHER THIS PROPOSAL WOULD REALLY AFFECT RETENTION OF DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS AND WE DON'T REALLY KNOW IF THIS IS A PROVEN APPROACH TO RETAINING- STAFF- ON THE INTERNSHIP COMPONENT OF THE PROPOSAL. WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE INTERNSHIPS WOULD BE PAID AT MINIMUM WAGE AND THE END RESULT OF THE INTERNSHIP MIGHT POSSIBLY ONLY BE A MINIMUM WAGE JOB IN THE FIELD AND SO THE QUESTION THIS RAISES FOR US IS HOW THIS WORD. WHILE IT MIGHT HAVE BENEFITS IN TERMS OF- PROVIDING EXPOSURE TO PEOPLE OR- TRAINING PERHAPS ON ON ENTERING THIS TYPE OF FIELD WHAT IT REALLY RESULT IN THE KIND OF RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION THAT'S NEEDED- IN THE IN THE DDS DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDER WORKFORCE AND WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS BEEN- DEMONSTRATED TO WORK ANYWHERE ELSE- WE'LL BE LOOKING INTO THIS OVER THE COMING WEEKS- AND THEN FINALLY ON THE TUITION REIMBURSEMENT HE SAID. OF THE PROPOSAL WE FEEL THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH DETAILS PROVIDED- TO MAKE AN ASSESSMENT OF THIS PROPOSAL- SO AGAIN THINKING OF THE ISSUE OF THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT- AND THINKING OF. YOU KNOW DOE A PROPOSAL WOULD BE HARD TO SPEND THE MONEY IN THE BUDGET YEAR- AND IT IN LIGHT OF THAT SORT OF CONSIDERATION WE DON'T KNOW IF- IF THE STATE WOULD REALLY BE ABLE TO SPEND THE FULL. THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ON TUITION FOR INDIVIDUALS IF THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO APPLY. TO SCHOOL LIKE HOW THAT TIMING WOULD WORK WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT. CLEAR THINKING OF A SECOND CONSIDERATION WITH THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT IS THE PROPOSAL READY TO GO- WE'RE NOT CLEAR THAT THE WORK REQUIREMENTS FOLLOWING SO RIGHT THE PROPOSAL SAYS THAT HAS BEEN INDIVIDUAL COULD GET THEIR TUITION REIMBURSED AND THEN THERE WOULD BE SORT OF A WORK REQUIREMENT THAT'S AGREED TO WITH THE- THE REGIONAL CENTER. I'M WE ARE NOT CLEAR OBSERVE WHAT THAT WORK REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT- WOULD POSSIBLY BE DETERMINED ON A REGIONAL CENTER BY REGIONAL CENTER BASIS. WE ASSUME THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD WANT SOME KIND OF ASSURANCES THAT THAT THE STATE'S DS SYSTEM WE'RE TRULY BENEFIT FROM. AN INVESTMENT OF THIS SIZE INTO INDIVIDUALS- ON EDUCATION EXPENSES. I'M. ONE ANOTHER ISSUE WITH THIS THE TUITION REIMBURSEMENT PROPOSAL IS THAT DDS INDICATED TO OUR OFFICE THAT ABOUT HALF OF THE REGIONAL CNTERS ARE UNIONIZED WE'RE NOT SURE IF THIS WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL OR HOW THAT'S BEEN CONSIDERED OR OR ADDRESSED AND THEN I WOULD JUST FINE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A FEW SMALL DETAILS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO FOR EXAMPLE THE PROPOSED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE REFERENCES- THAT THAT THIS FUNDING WOULD HELP REGIONAL CENTER STAFF PAID FOR. ADVANCED DEGREES NOW BEEN DANCED AGREES ARE TYPICALLY UNDERSTOOD AS GRADUATE AND POSTGRADUATE DEGREES BUT IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD ALSO WANT TO INCLUDE- UNDERGRADUATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR REGIONAL CENTER STAFF SO THESE ARE JUST THE SORT OF DETAILS THAT COULD KIND OF HAVE A HAVE A BIG IMPACT BUT BUT DETAILS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN IRONED OUT YET. I'M SO WITH THAT I ALL STOP AND- THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND- AGAIN WILL CONTINUE TO REVIEW THESE VARIOUS PROPOSALS AND PROVIDE COMMENTS TO- SUB COMMITTEE STAFF THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF GEORGE BUSH AND YOU WANNA DO YOU WANT TO ENSURE THAT ARE THESE SHOVEL READY AS THEY SAY CAN WE- DO THIS AND SPEND THESE IN A YEAR. YES THANK YOU MATTER CHAIR AND I NEVER PERSON DEVELOP SERVICES- SO COUPLE THINGS I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHEN IS THAT WE REALLY ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE PROPOSAL ON WORKFORCE- WORKFORCE WILL TAKE DOESN'T COME INTO COMPONENTS WITH THE DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS. OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN EXPRESSING THE CHALLENGES. OF BEING ABLE TO RETAIN AND TO BE ABLE TO RECRUIT AND- HAVE ADDITIONAL STAFF IN THE KIND OF THE STAFFING DEMANDS WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A NATIONAL CHALLENGE. YOU KNOW IN FIGHTING DRUG SERVICE WORKERS- IN AND SO MANY SUPPORT AREAS ON NOT ONLY WITHIN DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES THIS IS THAT. A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. SO WE REALLY WANTED TO THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX BUT ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT WAYS THAT WE COULD USE EXISTING- APPROACHES THAT HAVE PROVEN TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF DRUG SERVICE WORKERS. I'M SO THE FIRST ONE IS. WITH THE TRAINING STIPEND. SO REALLY I'M HAVING THE UP THERE'S AN EXISTING. A NATIONAL. THAT HAVE EXISTING TRAINING COMPONENTS THAT ARE UPDATED THEIR MODULES THAT. HAVE BEEN UNDERUSED BY SO MANY DIFFERENT PROVIDERS AS WELL AS OTHER STATES. SO WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS SOME EXISTING OFF THE SHELF- TRAINING- THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE- THRUWAY AID REMOTES- MECHANISM SO IT WOULD NOT HAVE TO BE COORDINATED OR OR- RESTRUCTURED DEVELOPED IN IN A WAY- AND SO AND BEING ABLE TO DO THAT AND RECOGNIZING THAT. THOSE OPPORTUNITY FOR TRAINING WHILE WE'RE STANDING UP FOR DRUG SERVICE PROFESSIONAL UNIVERSITY IS REALLY A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT SERVICE PROVIDERS TO HAVE THIS ADDED LAYER TRAINING BUT ALSO- A RECOGNITION OF THE WORK THAT THE DRUG SERVICE PROFESSIONALS WITHIN DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES- CAN HAVE. SO THAT PROPOSAL IS FOR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT WOULD GO TO THE DRUG SERVICE- WORKERS AND THEN THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE OF A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS THAT WOULD GO TO THE SERVICE PROVIDER TO HELP ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE. AND THEN I'M TALKING ABOUT THE- THE WORK ON THE- INTERNSHIP. SO AGAIN IS THIS THIS IS WHAT I'M A NEW IDEA THIS IS WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN. HELP BRING IN- INDIVIDUALS TO WORK WITHIN THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM AND- SUPPORTING OUR CONSUMERS. THIS IS A DIFFERENT MODEL THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- WE DO WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRY. OF BEING ABLE TO. VISUALS ON THREES AS AS SUCH I'M GONNA USE FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD LIKE A STAFFING AGENCY. THEY CAN TRAIN THEY CAN GO AHEAD AND THEN COORDINATE WITH THE PROVIDER FOR A INTERNSHIP PROGRAM. REALLY SEEKING TO WORK WITH MAYBE THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THAT- HAD ACCESS TO PROVIDE SERVICS ON. MANY PROVIDERS WILL GO AHEAD AND HIRE SOMEBODY- IN WANTING TO HAVE SOMEBODY WITH EXPERIENCE. THIS WOULD BRING PEOPLE AND TO HAVE THAT- AS AN IN. WITH HIS WITH THE- FOR THREE. ON TO BE ABLE TO THAT EXPERIENCE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES WORK WITH COLLEGE PROGRAMS WORK WITH- WITH EDT I'M REALLY TRYING TO BRANCH OUT AND OCT ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY DIVERSIFY OUR WORKFORCE- REGARDING THE- REGIONAL CENTER- PRINT SERVICE COORDINATORS TO. INCREASE OVER THE NEXT- YEAR WE'RE REALLY LOOKING TO INCREASE SERVICE COORDINATOR THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS. SO BASED ON THE PROPOSALS AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT WAS APPROVED FOR- REDUCING SERVICE COORDINATOR CASELOADS. AND THEN ALSO WITH THE- NEW PROPOSALS- IN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO REDUCE SERVICE COORDINATOR RATIOS FOR BIRTH- YOU'RE FIVE YEARS OLD- WE'RE WE'RE ESTIMATING ANYWHERE FROM THIRTEEN HUNDRED TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED SERVICE COORDINATORS. THAT ARE NEEDED OVER THE NEXT YEAR THAT IS NOT INCLUDING THE TURNOVER RATE. MANY COUNTIES CENTER THREE THAT THEY LOSE SOME OF THEIR STAFF TO COUNTIES AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICE ENTITIES THAT HAVE TUITION REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS AND SO REALLY HELPING THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE A MECHANISM TO HAVE. NOT ONLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT THEIR STAFF BUT ALSO TO- HAVE SOME. KIND OF COMPETITIVE NATURE AND- THE WORK FORCE THAT IS IN HIGH DEMAND- AND SO- HISPANIC EXACTLY CORRECT WE DO WANT TO BE ABLE TO NOT ONLY SAFER EXISTING SERVICE COORDINATORS BUT THOSE MANY WORKERS THAT ARE WORKING AT REGIONAL CENTERS THAT MAY NOT HAVE A- UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE THAT THIS MAY ALSO BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO- OPEN THE DOOR FOR THEM TO- BE SERVICE COORDINATORS- EVEN AS THEY'VE BEEN COMMITTED TO WORKING AT A REGIONAL CENTER. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- I WANT ONE LAST THING I WOULD NOTE ON THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE TUITION REIMBURSEMENT THAT ACTUALLY THE LANGUAGE- WOULD PROVIDE US THE ABILITY TO- YOU. EXPEND THE FUNDS THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE. WE DON'T HAVE ANY PROPOSED- ON LANGUAGE I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND LUNCH STAFF ON- AREAS THAT THERE MAY BE OF INTEREST- BUT WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN- THE WORK AT THE REGIONAL CENTER LEVEL AND KNOWING THAT EVERY CATCHMENT AREAS VERY DIFFERENT THEIR RECRUITMENT EFFORTS ARE- FACED BY DIFFERENT CHALLENGES- SO BEING TOO PRESCRIPTIVE MAY NOT WORK WITH ONE REGIONAL CENTER VERSUS ANOTHER REGIONAL CENTER AS AN EXAMPLE- SO HAPPY THAT- YOU HAVE THAT CONVERSATION- WITH WITH. THE COMMITTEE OKAY AND I KNOW IT FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE'VE REALLY FOCUSED ON THIS AND REALLY TRIED TO GET CAREER PATHWAYS AND ANNA AND A NETWORK OR SO I'VE I APPRECIATE AND RESPECT ALL THE WORK THAT THAT YOU FOLKS HAVE DONE- AND I AM OF THE MANAGING DOESN'T DOESN'T LAY THAT OUT HERE BUT THERE WILL BE A LOT OF INTERACTION WITH- WITH H. CHI. I JUST DON'T GET NERVOUS ARE THE ONES WHICH WILL BE DOING A LOT OF THIS WORK FORCE TRAINING AND ALL OF THAT BUT MAKING SURE THERE'S COORDINATION WHEN DEPARTMENTS CAN HAVE THEIR OWN THEIR OWN PROGRAMS THAT THERE'S COORDINATION BETWEEN THOSE TWO SO. WE'RE NOT. IN COMPETITION WITH EACH OTHER. pNEEDED WHEN- DEPARMENTS AND- AGENCIES- WE WOULD WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO THAT. THANK YOU DR PAN. THANK YOU AND- I DO APPRECIATE- SILICA THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE WORK FORCE ABILITY AT THE END OF THE QUESTION IS WHETHER WE NEED IT I THINK THE QUESTION IS THAT ARE. YOU KNOW. WE HAVE THE GUIDELINES IN PLACE AND- APPRECIATE THAT THE TESTIMONY ABOUT- FLEXIBILITY BUT- I ALSO NEED TO BE TAUGHT ABILITY SO WE'RE PUTTING HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION TO DESTROYING TWENTY STIPENDS. BUT THE LAW SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE OPEN ENDED OBVIOUSLY WE YOU KNOW WE WANT FOR THE HELP IMPROVE RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT INTO. THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND OTHERS- BUT I THINK HAVING- FIGUEIRA HAVING SOME STANDARDS THAT WE CAN THEREFORE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT- I WOULD MAKE A NOTE THAT AND INITIAL TESTIMONY- THE LEASE WAS MENTIONED AND OF AN AREA THAT IS GREAT INTEREST TO ME IS A- AS CHAIR OF THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUSES BE SURE WE HAVE ORE. SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO CAN SPEAK IN LANGUAGE. AND THAT- AND THAT LANGUAGE SKILLS ARE RECOGNIZED- THOSE THOSE. IT WAS SET IN THE NATIONAL PRESENTATION BUT- THERE WASN'T A FOLLOW THROUGH IN TERMS OF LIKE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF WHAT HOW MUCH OF THESE RESOURCES ARE GOING TO BE TO RECOGNIZE OR TO TRAIN. PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO RIDE IN LANGUAGE SERVICES SO. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE ABLE TO COMMENT ON THAT ARE NOT UNDER TO WORK FOR STABILITY PROPOSALS. THANK YOU DR PAN NANCY FOR TREND ABOUT LITTLE SERVICES. SO REGARDING- AND REALLY APPRECIATE HIGHLIGHTING AGAIN BE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAD- IN THE BUDGET AFTER TWENTY TWENTY ONE OF THE BILINGUAL PAY DIFFERENTIAL- AND THAT WAS REALLY INTENDED TO INCREASE THAT. SO WE WOULD STILL- IN OUR OUR RECRUITMENT AND- ALSO LIFTING UP. AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE DIRECT SERVICE WORKERS AND- AND MAYBE EVEN SOME OF THEIR LANGUAGES THAT THEY'RE MOST COMFORTABLE AND LEARNING IN- MUCH OF THE TRAINING THAT IS PROVIDED IS ACTUALLY IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES- AND THEN ALSO THE RECRUITMENT OF THE WORKERS. IN LOOKING AT THE- INTERNSHIP. WE'LL BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO- IT EXPLORE HOW WE ARE REACHING- VARIOUS COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OUR- CONSUMERS THAT WERE SURVEYED ARE VERY DIVERSE AND THEIR NEEDS ARE VERY DIVERSE AND WE WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL OF THAT. THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO SOME REAL INTENTIONAL OUTREACH IN THOSE AREAS- AND CERTAINLY WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT REGIONAL CENTER TUITION REIMBURSEMENT THE OPPORTUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO HELP SUPPORT THOSE THAT. MAY NOT HAVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE- OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERGRADUATE OR ADVANCED DEGREES. OKAY AND- TUITION REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM SO FORTH- WELL I SHOULD SHOULD PRESUME BUT- THERE'S SOME OBLIGATION TO CONTINUE WORK AND- AND DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES FOR AT LEAST A FEW YEARS- IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR- REIMBURSEMENT. SO FORTH THAT WE AS A FIRMER SUSPENSION STANDPOINT. OR NOT TWENTY PEOPLE TO LEAVE. YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND YOU KNOW IT'S SAID WITH THE INTENT OF A YOU SEEN THAT TUITION REIMBURSEMENTS YOU REALLY KIND OF BUILD THE CAPACITY WITHIN DEVELOPMENT. IS IMPORTANT- SO CERTAIN SERVICE EXPECTATIONS WOULD. BE TIED TO THAT ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL RIGHT GET FREE STATE ID JUST ONE MAYBE QUICKLY MENTION TO TWO THINGS IN THE MAY REVISED I DO APPRECIATE A TAKER EARLY- THE EARLY START ELIGIBILITY IS A DEVELOPMENTAL PEDIATRICIAN- THAT WE'RE STARTING TO TOP THE STANDARD IT'S- SIMILAR TO OTHER STATES WITH 25% DELAY. POINT OUT THAT- ESPECIALLY DURING OUR EARLY START AGES THOSE ARE CRITICAL PERIODS OF DEVELOPMENT AND THE WINDOWS PASSED BY TAKES A LOT MORE WORK TO ADDRESS THE DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS SO BEING ABLE TO GET SOMEONE REFERRED TO EARLIER AND TO GET HELP EARLIER IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT. THEN OF COURSE WE'VE BEEN DELAYED HALF THE BILLING FOR A WHILE SO ACTUALLY IT WAS ONLY TWENTY IT'S ONLY TWENTY EIGHT TO TWENTY MILLION OR ONE POINT NINE GENERAL FUND SO. WELL CERTAINLY. OF ANYTHING ELSE. MILLER THE L. ONE POINT NINE MILLION SIR NOT INTO OF YOU MAILING BUT THE CONTEXT OF THE WHOLE STAY BUDGET- TO BE ABLE TO. THAT FOR. THAT AND- IS WORTH IT MY BUT THANKS MUCH FOR YOUR THE PRESENT. MADE THINK YOU. OKAY MOVING ON TO THIS CAL. UNDER.
