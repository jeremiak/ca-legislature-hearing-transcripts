ELDERLY HAS LARGELY IF ALMOST

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:33.359
EXCLUSIVELY BEEN DEEMED AS

WOMEN'S WORK- IT'S ALWAYS

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.597
INTERESTING WHEN. I'VE SEEN

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:40.266
WHEN MEN- ARE FORCED TO SPEND

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:41.734
TIME AT HOME EITHER CARING FOR

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:44.103
A NEWBORN OR SICK PARENT THEIR

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.338
MORE ANXIOUS TO GET BACK TO

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:48.241
WORK. THAN EVER- BECAUSE THE

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:50.276
ILLUSIONIST BAND THAT WOMEN'S

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:53.513
WORK IS REALLY QUITE EASY- THAT

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.415
WOMEN ARE THE ARE THE ONES WHO

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:57.617
SHOULD BE DOING IT- AND THAT-

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:59.152
MIX RESPONSIBILITY IS THE MORE

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.323
IMPORTANT TO WORK OUT WORKPLACE

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:04.357
AND OF COURSE THIS IS THE

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:05.391
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY MORE WOMEN

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:08.962
ARE WORKING. THEY ARE THAN EVER

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:12.265
BEFORE EITHER A SOUL. OF

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:13.333
PRIMARY BREADWINNER OR IN

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:14.033
TODAY'S WORLD THERE INCOMES

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.068
NECESSARY EVEN A TWO INCOME

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:15.668
FAMILY IN ORDER TO MAKE ENDS

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:17.804
MEET. I REMEMBER AS A CHILD I

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:19.973
CAME FROM AN INTACT OF TWO

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.307
PARENT FAMILY MY DAD WORKED MY

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:23.776
MOM WAS A STAY AT HOME MOM. AND

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:24.811
THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE ENDS

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:28.381
MEET IN THAT WORLD- THAT IS NOT

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:30.550
THE WORLD TODAY I THINK IF THAT

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:31.584
WERE THE SITUATION WITH MY

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.553
FOLKS AND BOTH BE WORKING IN

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.388
THE QUESTION WOULD BE. HOW DO

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:37.190
WE ACCOMMODATE WHEN PERRANCE

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:40.793
GETS SICK CHILDREN ARE SICK. A

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.394
AND WHEN THEY WERE NEWBORNS IN

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.396
A FAMILY. LEE I BELIEVE THAT

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:44.030
THERE ARE MORE YOUNG MEN TODAY

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:45.198
WHO WILL BE PART OF THAT

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:47.267
EXPERIENCE THAT. THE EXPERIENCE

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.502
OF RAISING CHILDREN OF CARING

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.204
FOR NEWBORNS IS ONE THAT IS

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.940
RICH. AND SATISFYING EXPERIENCE

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.508
BUT THE WORKPLACE TODAY JUST

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:57.477
HAS NOT BEEN AS ACCOMMODATING.

00:02:57.544 --> 00:03:00.213
AS IT SHOULD BE- AND ACCORDING

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.550
TO A AN EXCELLENT BACKGROUND-PAPER WHICH IF YOU HAVEN'T READ

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:04.918
IT THE SENATE OFFICE OF

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:07.987
RESEARCH. HAS CONDUCTED IT'S

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:09.222
AVAILABLE ON THE SENATE

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:10.790
SEKOLAH. SELECT COMMITTEE ON

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:13.626
WOMEN WORKING FAMILIES WEBSITE.

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:16.496
IN 201650% OF CHILDREN YOUNGER

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:19.699
THAN A YEAR 50% WERE IN A

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:22.035
HOUSEHOLD. WHERE EITHER BOTH

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:23.703
PARENTS WORK OR THEIR SINGLE

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.006
PARENT. FIFTY IN NINETEEN

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:27.640
SEVENTY SIX IT WAS ONLY TWENTY

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:28.608
PERCENT. SO THIS IS SOMETHING

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:29.976
THAT WE HAVEN'T ADEQUATELY

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.211
ADDRESSED AND THAT WE MUST DO

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:34.981
AND I HAVE TO SAY- THE UNITED

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.916
STATES OF AMERICA HAS THE VERY

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:38.785
SHAMEFUL DISTINCTION. OF BEING

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.853
THE ONLY INDUSTRIALIZED NATION

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.122
IN THE WORLD. WITHOUT A PAID

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.192
FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. SO IF

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:47.293
THAT'S WHAT AMERICAN

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.729
EXCEPTIONALISM IS SUPPOSED TO

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:51.197
BE THEN I SUSPECT WE NEED TO

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:53.633
CHANGE THAT DEFINITION- SO

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.168
WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:57.737
WILL NOT LEAD- WE IN CALIFORNIA

00:03:57.804 --> 00:03:59.606
WE LIKE TO BE FIRST. EVEN IF WE

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:01.841
DON'T NECESSARILY DO IT BEST-

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.978
BUT WE DO LIKE TO BE FIRST AND-

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:07.180
WE WERE FIRST BACK IN I THINK

00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:09.816
WAS TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR US

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:12.285
THEN SENATOR SHEILA KEWL. OF A

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:13.953
DEAR FRIEND OF VISIONARY IN

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.322
MANY AREAS THAT WERE ABOUT TO

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.925
TALK ABOUT WAS ABLE TO CREATE

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:20.026
THE NATION'S FIRST PAID FAMILY

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:23.196
PROGRAM NOW IT WAS FIRST IT HAD

00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:26.899
ISSUES OF FIFTEEN YEARS LATER

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:30.069
WE NEED TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:32.271
AND WE NEED TO THE PATIENTS.

00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:35.274
THAT EXIST DAY IN THIS PROGRAM

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:39.812
SO. I KNOW MEMBER GONZALEZ WILL

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:40.446
TALK ABOUT HER OWN WORK ON THIS

00:04:40.513 --> 00:04:41.080
AND I THINK THIS WAS A SINGLE

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:42.582
PARENT RAISING A FAMILY THE

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:44.917
CHALLENGES THAT SHE HAD TO

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:45.551
INJURE WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:47.153
WITNESSED TALKING ABOUT. IN

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.322
REAL TIME WHAT IT'S- FOR WE

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.623
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DECIDE

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.192
BETWEEN. A CARING FOR OUR LOVED

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.294
ONES AND PUTTING FOOD ON THE

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:57.964
TABLE IS TRUST A NON STARTER AS

00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:00.199
A PART OF THE DISCUSSION WE'RE

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:03.436
SHOULD BE IN TODAY'S WORLD SO-

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:05.238
WE HAVE A INEQUALITY THOSE WHO

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.248
CONCERNS. BUT FOR OUR LOW

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:17.083
INCOME OR MIDDLE INCOME

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.418
FAMILIES THIS TRUST IS NOT A

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:20.953
REALITY SO WE ARE IMPORTANT

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.589
JUNCTURE GOVERNOR NEWSOME- HAS

FINE BECAUSE WE HAVE A STRONG

CHANCE THAT WOMEN WILL STAYON

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:42.068

THIS YEAR YES. WE WILL GET AT

SOME OF THESE THINGS ACTUALLY

00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:47.493
DONE CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN AT THE

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.462
FOREFRONT- HISTORICALLY OF PAID

00:08:49.528 --> 00:08:51.597
FAMILY LEAVE. BUT THE TRUTH IS

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:53.266
WE DIDN'T DO IT PERFECT- AND WE

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:55.134
DIDN'T DO A PASSED AND SO AS A

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:58.971
RESULT IN- AND WHAT WE KNOW NOW

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:01.507
THERE ARE SOME I THAT.OBVIOUS

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:03.309
DISPARITIES AND HOW THIS LAW IS

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:06.479
IMPLEMENTED- ONE OF THE BIGGEST

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:07.513
PROBLEMS IS THAT INCOME

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.382
REPLACEMENT SET TO SIXTY TO

00:09:09.448 --> 00:09:11.250
SEVENTY PERCENT. AT TODAY

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:13.319
HAPPENS TO BE LATINO EQUAL PAY

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:14.654
DAY THE DAY WHEN WE REMEMBER

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.923
THAT LATINOS MAKE FIFTY FOUR

00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:18.057
CENTS ON THE DOLLAR PER UNDER

00:09:18.124 --> 00:09:20.760
WHITE ADD MAIL COUNTY ART. IN

00:09:20.826 --> 00:09:24.263
CALIFORNIA. IN THIS IS THE

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.164
SHOULD SHAME ALL. YOU TOO IT'S

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:27.266
ON THE- WHITE MALE CAM

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:29.001
COUNTERPART THAT IS THE

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:31.304
LARGEST- PAY GAP OF ANY

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.306
DEMOGRAPHIC. AND ONE WHICH IS

00:09:33.372 --> 00:09:38.577
EXASPERATED. WHEN. I A LATINO

00:09:38.644 --> 00:09:41.914
WHAT OUT ON LEAVE. HAVING A

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:43.015
CHILD AND BEING PAID SIXTY OR

00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:45.284
70% OF THAT- OBVIOUSLY THIS IS

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:46.652
NOT NECESSARILY IN MANY TIMES

00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:47.720
FOR THAT. THE LOWEST PAID

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:49.055
WORKERS SOMETHING THAT

00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:50.856
SUSTAINABLE SO ALTHOUGH THESE

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:53.025
WORKERS PAY IN TO THE SYSTEM AT

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:55.561
THE SAME RATE AS EVERYBODY ELSE

00:09:55.628 --> 00:09:56.963
THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE ABLE

00:09:57.029 --> 00:10:00.166
TO ACTUALLY ACCESS THAT LEAVE-

00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:02.735
THEIR PAIN FOR IN FACT. WOMEN

00:10:02.802 --> 00:10:04.503
AND MEN AT AT IN DIFFERENT

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:05.404
INCOME LEVELS TO BE ABLE TO

00:10:05.471 --> 00:10:06.839
TAKE THAT LEAVES SO WE NEED TO

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:09.575
ADDRESS THAT DISPARITY IN AND-

00:10:09.642 --> 00:10:10.710
ADMIT TO OURSELVES THAT IT

00:10:10.776 --> 00:10:12.144
EXISTS. THE OTHER ISSUE IS

00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:14.180
WHETHER OR NOT- A WOMAN HAS A

00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:17.049
PROTECTION OF COURSE HER JOB OR

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:19.018
MAN AND I AM SORRY I. PITCH IT

00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:20.953
IS WOMEN- BUT THE PROTECT AND

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:21.821
SHOP PROTECTION WHEN SHE LEAVES

00:10:21.887 --> 00:10:23.522
AND THAT IS ANOTHER ISSUE WHICH

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:26.325
HIGHLY AFFECTS WHETHER OR NOT-

00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:27.960
SOMEBODY CAN ACTUALLY TAKE

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:29.895
FAMILY LEAVE IF THEY HAVE NO

00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:32.431
GUARANTEES OF A JOB WHEN COMING

00:10:32.498 --> 00:10:34.667
BACK- THAT OBVIOUSLY WAYS INTO

00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:36.802
A DECISION SO. IF YOU COMPOUND

00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:37.903
THOSE TWO THINGS NOT HAVING THE

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:38.871
PROTECTIONS OF THE JOB WHICH

00:10:38.938 --> 00:10:39.839
WERE WOMAN STILL IN MANDATE

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:41.807
STILL DON'T HAVE ALONG WITH-

00:10:41.874 --> 00:10:45.144
BEING LOWER PAID- THE- RIGHT TO

00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:46.579
ACCESS FAMILY LEAVE IS

00:10:46.645 --> 00:10:47.847
COMPLETELY OUT OF THEIR HANDS.

00:10:47.913 --> 00:10:49.882
SO WHAT WE HOPE TO DO THROUGH

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:51.784
THE STUDY THROUGH THE

00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:53.252
GOVERNOR'S COMMISSION AND

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:54.253
THROUGH SOME OF THE TESTIMONY

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.156
TODAY IS REALLY A KNOWLEDGE IN

00:10:57.223 --> 00:11:02.294
THAT FOR THOSE TWO ISSUES THOSE

00:11:02.361 --> 00:11:06.298
TWO. ISSUES IN THE. THIS MAN AS

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:08.167
WELL. SECURITY WITH LONG WAY

00:11:08.234 --> 00:11:08.768
INTACT ADDING SOME EQUITY INTO

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:10.803
OURS. NO WAY DO WE SUGGEST THAT

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:11.404
PAID FAMILY LEAVE SHOULD BE

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:12.271
LONGER IT SHOULD AND WE I THINK

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:12.805
SUPPORT THAT IDEA

00:11:12.872 --> 00:11:13.406
WHOLEHEARTEDLY BUT AT THE SAME

00:11:13.472 --> 00:11:15.207
TIME AS WE'RE LOOKING TO MAKE-

00:11:15.274 --> 00:11:16.909
THAT LEAVE LONGER WE NEED TO

00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:18.110
MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY CAN

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:20.713
ACTUALLY ACCESS THAT. SO TODAY

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.481
I AM I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING

00:11:22.548 --> 00:11:25.084
FOR OUR SPEAKERS AND OUT

00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:25.718

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:28.154

TOGETHER WE WILL- STARTER

BLOWING UP SOME OF THESE.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.163
CULTURAL INFIRMITIES THAT HAVE

00:11:37.229 --> 00:11:39.799
REALLY KEPT- WOMEN AND FAMILIES

00:11:39.865 --> 00:11:43.069

REASONS THEY'VE BEEN LEFT

00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:52.724
HOWEVER THE PAYMENT RATE OF

00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:54.459
SEVENTY PERCENT. ONLY APPLIES

00:24:54.526 --> 00:24:56.461

STATE'S AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE

00:25:00.131 --> 00:25:01.666
ANNUALLY THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY

ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED

00:25:02.267 --> 00:25:05.904

CALIFORNIA WHO'S WOKING FULL

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.675
TIME HERE AROUND WOULD MAKE TOO

00:25:10.742 --> 00:25:12.878
MUCH TO QUALIFY FOR THE HIGHER

00:25:12.944 --> 00:25:15.547
WAGE REPLACEMENT RATE. WHEN

00:25:15.614 --> 00:25:16.815
COMPARED TO OTHER STATES ARE

00:25:16.882 --> 00:25:17.949
PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM THE

00:25:18.016 --> 00:25:19.251
OTHER STATES WITH PAY FAMILY

00:25:19.317 --> 00:25:21.286
PROGRAMS CALIFORNIA WHICH IS

00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:22.854
REPRESENTED WITH THAT ORANGE

00:25:22.921 --> 00:25:25.924
BAR HAS THE SECOND LOWEST.

00:25:25.991 --> 00:25:26.858
PAYMENT RATE FOR WORKER MAKING

00:25:26.925 --> 00:25:29.861
TWELVE DOLLARS PER HOUR. AND

00:25:29.928 --> 00:25:30.428
TWENTY NINETEEN THAT WORKER

00:25:30.495 --> 00:25:32.831
WILL RECEIVE A WEEKLY PAY LEAVE

00:25:32.898 --> 00:25:33.398
PAYMENT OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

00:25:33.465 --> 00:25:35.567
NINETY DOLLARS. ON THE OTHER

00:25:35.634 --> 00:25:36.968
HAND OREGON WHICH IS THE NEW

00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:39.371
STATE TO ENACT A PALEY PROGRAM

00:25:39.437 --> 00:25:40.639
THEY'RE GOING TO FULLY REPLACE

00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:42.641
WAGES FOR LOWER WAGE WORKERS IF

00:25:42.707 --> 00:25:45.577
ORGANS. LEAVE PROGRAM WERE

00:25:45.644 --> 00:25:47.879

00:25:47.946 --> 00:25:48.546
WORKER MAKING TWELVE DOLLARS AN

00:25:48.613 --> 00:25:50.916

EIGHTY DOLLARS PER WEEK THAT

66% HIGHER THAN CALIFORNIA'S

00:25:55.153 --> 00:25:58.690
PAYMENT. SO AS WE KNOW THESE

00:25:58.757 --> 00:26:00.025
LOW PAYMENTS CAN BE A BARRIER

00:26:00.091 --> 00:26:01.660
FOR SOME WORKERS AND BOOSTING

00:26:01.726 --> 00:26:04.195
THE PAYMENT RATE FOR LOWER WAGE

00:26:04.262 --> 00:26:05.230
WORKERS IN PARTICULAR COULD

00:26:05.297 --> 00:26:08.066
PROVIDE THE FINANCIAL SECURITY

THEY NEED. TO ACCESS OUR PAY

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:12.337
FAMILY PROGRAM. SO AS WE'VE

00:26:12.404 --> 00:26:13.805
ALSO HEARD ANOTHER BARRIER

00:26:13.872 --> 00:26:14.940
TAXES THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE IS

00:26:15.006 --> 00:26:16.908
THE LACK OF JOB PROTECTIONS

00:26:16.975 --> 00:26:17.809
WHEN WORKERS THE TIME AWAY TO

00:26:17.876 --> 00:26:19.611
CARE FOR THEIR FAMILY. SELECT A

00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:21.313
JOB PROTECTIONS MEANS EMPLOYERS

00:26:21.379 --> 00:26:23.415
DO NOT HAVE TO GUARANTEE THAT

00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:25.216
THEIR WORKERS WILL HAVE A JOB

00:26:25.283 --> 00:26:26.518
WHEN THEY'RE PAID THE PERIOD

00:26:26.584 --> 00:26:28.086
ENDS. NO IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

00:26:28.153 --> 00:26:30.355
THAT. OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL

00:26:30.422 --> 00:26:33.692
LAWS TO PROVIDE UNPAID JOB

00:26:33.758 --> 00:26:35.527

00:26:41.232 --> 00:26:43.835
AND THIS ON PAID JOB PROTECT

00:26:43.902 --> 00:26:46.504
YOU'VE AT THE SAME TIME.

00:26:46.571 --> 00:26:47.706
UNFORTUNATELY WHILE THE VAST

00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:48.340
MAJORITY OF WORKERS IN

00:26:48.406 --> 00:26:48.974
CALIFORNIA. ELIGIBLE FOR PAID

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.941
FAMILY LEAVE MILLIONS OF

00:26:50.008 --> 00:26:51.376
WORKERS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR

00:26:51.443 --> 00:26:53.411
UNPAID JOB PROTECTED LEAVE. DUE

00:26:53.478 --> 00:26:54.980
TO THE RESTRICTIONS WRITTEN

00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:56.481
INTO THE LIES THAT ARE BASED ON

00:26:56.548 --> 00:26:58.249
THE SIZE OF THE EMPLOYER THE

00:26:58.316 --> 00:26:59.284
LENGTH OF TIME THEY SPEND WITH

00:26:59.351 --> 00:27:01.186
AN EMPLOYER. AND THE NUMBER OF

00:27:01.252 --> 00:27:02.887
HOURS THEY'VE WORKED WITH THAT

00:27:02.954 --> 00:27:05.023
SAME EMPLOYER. SO AS AN EXAMPLE

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:07.425
THIS HER SHOWS THAT FOR INTO

00:27:07.492 --> 00:27:09.127
MARKETING CALIFORNIA OVER SEVEN

00:27:09.194 --> 00:27:10.228
MILLION WORKERS. EARN A

WORKPLACE WITH MORE THAN FIFTY

00:27:12.397 --> 00:27:13.865
EMPLOYEES AND THAT MEANS

00:27:13.932 --> 00:27:15.033
THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR ARE

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.434
PROTECTED THE YOU'VE TO CARE

FOR A SICK FAMILY MEMBER AS AN

00:27:18.103 --> 00:27:20.305
EXAMPLE. IN ADDITION AT ONE

00:27:20.372 --> 00:27:22.440
POINT FOUR MILLION WORKERS OR

00:27:22.507 --> 00:27:24.309
ABOUT 8% ARE IN ORDER ISSUE

00:27:24.376 --> 00:27:26.478
WITH FEWER THAN FIVE EMPLOYEES.

00:27:26.544 --> 00:27:29.481
WHICH MEANS THAT THEY DON'T

00:27:29.547 --> 00:27:29.981
HAVE ACCESS TO. THE JOB

00:27:30.048 --> 00:27:33.118
PROTECTED THE IF. UNDER THE

00:27:33.184 --> 00:27:35.620
OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS.

00:27:35.687 --> 00:27:36.187
THE WIND ALSO ABOUT WORKERS

00:27:36.254 --> 00:27:36.788
WITH LOW WAGES ARE MORE LIKELY

00:27:36.855 --> 00:27:37.222
TO WORK IN SMALLER

00:27:37.288 --> 00:27:37.789
ORGANIZATIONS THEY'RE MORE

00:27:37.856 --> 00:27:38.390
LIKELY TO HAVE MULTIPLE PART

00:27:38.456 --> 00:27:40.658
TIME JOBS WHICH MEANS THEY'RE

00:27:40.725 --> 00:27:42.494
LESS LIKELY TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.962
JOB PROTECTED LEAVE UNDER THESE

00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:46.965
OTHER LIES WHICH MEANS THAT

00:27:47.032 --> 00:27:47.599
PAID FAMILY LEAVE MAY SIMPLY BE

00:27:47.665 --> 00:27:49.300
OUT FOR EACH FOR THEM. THE

00:27:49.367 --> 00:27:50.635
CALIFORNIA CANCEL. THEIR STATES

00:27:50.702 --> 00:27:52.170
IN A CORPORATE JOB PROTECTIONS

00:27:52.237 --> 00:27:53.238
INTO OUR PAID FAMILY LEAVE

00:27:53.304 --> 00:27:55.673
PROGRAM. THIS IS GONNA ALLOW

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.008
MORE WORKERS TO UTILIZE THIS

00:27:57.075 --> 00:27:59.344
PROGRAM THAT THEY- MOST

00:27:59.411 --> 00:27:59.911
CERTAINLY WILL NEED AT SOME

00:27:59.978 --> 00:28:03.281
POINT IN THEIR CAREER. SO

00:28:03.348 --> 00:28:04.549
FINALLY POLICYMAKERS CAN MAKE

00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:05.950
SURE THAT WORKERS HAVE ENOUGH

00:28:06.017 --> 00:28:07.152
TIME WE FROM WORK TO CARE FOR

00:28:07.218 --> 00:28:08.586
THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. THE

00:28:08.653 --> 00:28:10.188
CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM

00:28:10.255 --> 00:28:11.389
PROVIDE SIX WEEKS OF PAID TIME

00:28:11.456 --> 00:28:13.458
OFF. WE ALL KNOW PROBABLY THAT

00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:14.659
THIS IS GOING TO EXTEND TO

00:28:14.726 --> 00:28:16.628
EIGHT WEEKS EFFECTIVE ON JULY

00:28:16.694 --> 00:28:17.862
ONE TWENTY TWENTY. HOWEVER

00:28:17.929 --> 00:28:19.364
WITHOUT FURTHER ACTION THE

00:28:19.431 --> 00:28:21.232
DURATION OF LEAVING CALIFORNIA

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:23.368
WILL FALL SHORT COMPARED TO

00:28:23.435 --> 00:28:23.902
OTHER STATES AND CERTAINLY

00:28:23.968 --> 00:28:26.805
OTHER NATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:28:26.871 --> 00:28:27.672
FINAL CHART THE DURATION LEAVE

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. AND IN

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:33.611
SIX OF THE NINE STATES WITH THE

PROGRAM OR WHEN THEY IMPLEMENT.

00:28:42.253 --> 00:28:44.322
THEIR NEW PAISLEY PROGRAM. SO

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:45.156
EXTENDING THE DURATION OF PAID

00:28:45.223 --> 00:28:46.524
LEAVE TO TWELVE WEEKS IS JUST

00:28:46.591 --> 00:28:48.359
ONE MORE STEP TO MAKING SURE.

00:28:48.426 --> 00:28:51.062
THAT FAMILIES HAVE ENOUGH TIME

00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:51.696

PAYMENTS PROVIDING JOB

00:28:58.169 --> 00:28:59.471
PROTECTIONS AND EXTENDING THE

00:28:59.537 --> 00:29:01.406
DURATION OF LEAF WOULD INCREASE

00:29:01.473 --> 00:29:04.042
ACCESS. AND UTILIZATION SO

00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:06.511
THIRD NUMBER WAYS POLICYMAKERS

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:07.112
CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE SPECIAL

00:29:07.178 --> 00:29:08.513

FUND. HAS THE RESOURCES TO

00:29:11.015 --> 00:29:13.318
PROVIDE PALEY BENEFITS. SO

00:29:13.384 --> 00:29:14.319
CURRENTLY PAID FAMILY LEAVE IS

00:29:14.385 --> 00:29:16.154
FUNDED ENTIRELY WITH WORKERS

00:29:16.221 --> 00:29:17.422
CONTRIBUTIONS THROUGH PAYROLL

00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:19.424
DEDUCTIONS. ONE OPTION IS TO

00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:21.793
REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO CONTRIBUTE

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:22.994
TO THE FUND RESEARCH SHOWS THAT

00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:25.196
PALEY BENEFITS WORKERS BUT ALSO

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:28.166
IN BENEFITS EMPLOYERS TO. WE

00:29:28.233 --> 00:29:29.300

00:29:29.367 --> 00:29:30.802
NINE STATES WITH PAVE THE

00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:31.369
PROGRAM REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO

00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:34.539
CONTRIBUTE. ANOTHER OPTION IS

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:35.773
TO INCREASE THE TAXABLE WAGE

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.142
CEILING WORKERS CURRENTLY DO

00:29:37.208 --> 00:29:38.843
NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE FONG ON

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.045
EARNINGS OVER ABOUT A HUNDRED

00:29:41.112 --> 00:29:41.613
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND IN ANNUAL

00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:42.647
EARNINGS. FOR STATES HAVE A

00:29:42.714 --> 00:29:44.115
HIGHER WAGE SO IN CALIFORNIA AT

00:29:44.182 --> 00:29:46.451
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY

00:29:46.518 --> 00:29:46.985
THREE THOUSAND IN ANNUAL

00:29:47.051 --> 00:29:49.187
EARNINGS. AND THEN THE LAST

00:29:49.254 --> 00:29:51.589
OPTION IS THAT POLICYMAKERS CAN

00:29:51.656 --> 00:29:53.324
ALSO INCREASE THE CONTRIBUTION

00:29:53.391 --> 00:29:54.459
RATE FOR THIS RAY UNDER STATE

00:29:54.526 --> 00:29:57.762
LAW CAN VARY BETWEEN. ON POINT

00:29:57.829 --> 00:30:01.099
1% TO ONE POINT 5% IT'S 1% AND

00:30:01.166 --> 00:30:02.934
TWENTY NINETEEN BUT I DO WANT

00:30:03.001 --> 00:30:03.801
TO NOTE THAT INCREASING THE

00:30:03.868 --> 00:30:05.503
CONTRIBUTION RATE WITH YOUR

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.238

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:11.776
WERE MORE. AND THE THEY CAN

00:30:11.843 --> 00:30:12.377
LEAST AFFORD LARGE. FROM THEIR

PAYCHECK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

00:30:15.246 --> 00:30:16.314
VERY MUCH HELPFUL AND I THINK

00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:18.349
THE FACT THAT- WE HAVE TO KEEP

00:30:18.416 --> 00:30:19.884
EMPHASIZING THAT THERE ARE

00:30:19.951 --> 00:30:22.353
BENEFITS TO THE EMPLOYERS WELL-

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.355
AND I APPRECIATE YOUR SAYING

00:30:24.422 --> 00:30:25.690
THAT I DID WANT TO MAKE ONE

00:30:25.757 --> 00:30:28.126
POINT- TO THE DIRECTOR HAD

00:30:28.193 --> 00:30:30.995
THINGS COMMENTS ABOUT THE-

00:30:31.062 --> 00:30:32.597
FIRST DAUGHTER WHATEVER HER

00:30:32.664 --> 00:30:36.067
TITLE IS THAT HER PROPOSAL IS

00:30:36.134 --> 00:30:36.901
TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO RAID THEIR

00:30:36.968 --> 00:30:39.871
SOCIAL SECURITY TO PAY FOR

00:30:39.938 --> 00:30:43.208
FAMILY LEAVE AND I HOPE WE

00:30:43.274 --> 00:30:46.044
DON'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR THAT.

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.611
NOTION THE ALREADY OF BEING

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:50.815
THAT SAFE. SO WHILE I

00:30:50.882 --> 00:30:51.616

00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:53.251
OF A FULL. ON THIS ISSUE- THAT

00:30:53.318 --> 00:30:54.118
KIND OF AN APPROACH I THINK

00:30:54.185 --> 00:30:56.020
WOULD BE TERRIBLY. REGRESSIVE

00:30:56.087 --> 00:30:58.790
AS YOU POLITELY PUT IT SO- I

00:30:58.856 --> 00:31:01.359
AGREE THIS IS A NON PARTISAN

00:31:01.426 --> 00:31:03.494
ISSUE. PEOPLE WHO VOTE ONE WAY

00:31:03.561 --> 00:31:05.897
OR ANOTHER STILL HAVE THE SAME

00:31:05.964 --> 00:31:07.232
FAMILY ISSUES TO ATTEND TO AND

00:31:07.298 --> 00:31:08.967
HOPEFULLY WE CAN. DO WITHOUT

00:31:09.033 --> 00:31:11.336
WITHOUT REALLY PUTTING FAMILIES

00:31:11.402 --> 00:31:14.038
AT RISK AND PUNISHING THEM

00:31:14.105 --> 00:31:16.241
WHICH ESSENTIALLY IS WHAT WE DO.

00:31:16.307 --> 00:31:17.342
IF WE START TAKING MONEY OUT OF

00:31:17.408 --> 00:31:18.610
PEOPLE'S POCKETS AND SO I JUST

00:31:18.676 --> 00:31:20.111
WANTED TO. SENATOR IF I MAY

00:31:20.178 --> 00:31:22.180

POLICIES THAT ARE OUT THERE.

00:31:26.818 --> 00:31:28.453
ARE SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:30.655
CONSIDER IN AS MUCH AS- THAT WE

00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:33.124
HAVE THE BEST A POLICY

00:31:33.191 --> 00:31:35.393
CURRENTLY- IN ALL THE STATES-

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.061
AND STILL COULD BE A LITTLE BIT

00:31:37.128 --> 00:31:38.663
BETTER HERE. I UST THINK IT'S

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:39.731
IMPORTANT CLARIFY BECAUSE AS

00:31:39.797 --> 00:31:42.066

LOW RATE OVERALL IS THERE'S AN

00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:17.962

EVIDENCE ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH.

00:33:51.562 --> 00:33:53.164
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT

00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:54.499
PAID FAMILY LEAVE HAS

00:33:54.565 --> 00:33:57.335
UNAMBIGUOUS UNAMBIGUOUSLY

LEADER IN LIFE. SO IN THE SHORT

00:34:04.542 --> 00:34:06.644
RUN- SOME WORK THAT I'VE DONE

00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:08.246
ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PAID

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:09.447
MATERNITY LEAVE UNDER

00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:11.115
CALIFORNIA'S STATE DISABILITY

00:34:11.182 --> 00:34:13.484
INSURANCE PROGRAM AND OTHER

00:34:13.551 --> 00:34:14.852
STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE

00:34:14.919 --> 00:34:16.587
PROGRAMS HAS SHOWN THAT PAID

00:34:16.654 --> 00:34:18.189
MATERNITY LEAVE. THE ACTUALLY

00:34:18.256 --> 00:34:20.258
IMPROVED INTENT HEALTH AT

00:34:20.324 --> 00:34:23.628
BIRTH- SO THIS FIGURE HERE

00:34:23.694 --> 00:34:25.897
SHOWS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE SHARE

00:34:25.963 --> 00:34:26.831
OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT BIRTHS IN

00:34:26.898 --> 00:34:30.268
THE STATE. THAT LIMIT OF PAID

00:34:30.334 --> 00:34:33.004
MATERNITY LEAVE THROUGH THEIR

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:35.807
BILL THE INTERNS. IN THE SOUL.

00:34:35.873 --> 00:34:36.374
COMPARED TO WHAT HAPPENED TO

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:37.742
THE LOW BIRTH WEIGHT RATE IN

00:34:37.809 --> 00:34:38.676
STATES THAT DID NOT IN THAT

00:34:38.743 --> 00:34:39.911
DASHLANE YOU CAN SEE. AS SOON

00:34:39.977 --> 00:34:41.279
AS PAID MATERNITY LEAVE- BECAME

00:34:41.345 --> 00:34:42.046
AVAILABLE THERE WAS A

00:34:42.113 --> 00:34:43.414
SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN THE

00:34:43.481 --> 00:34:46.117
SHARE OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT BIRTH

00:34:46.184 --> 00:34:47.051
WE ALSO SEE IMPROVEMENTS IN

00:34:47.118 --> 00:34:49.053
OTHER MEASURES OF INFANT. BIRTH

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.956
WE ALSO KNOW FROM THAT

00:34:52.023 --> 00:34:53.291
PRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL

00:34:53.357 --> 00:34:55.059
FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT

00:34:55.126 --> 00:34:56.828
THE ACCESS TO UNPAID LEAVE ALSO

00:34:56.894 --> 00:34:59.197
IMPROVES BIRTH OUTCOMES. BUT

00:34:59.263 --> 00:35:00.398
ONE IMPORTANT DISTINCTION I

00:35:00.465 --> 00:35:03.701
THINK IS THAT- WHEN WE PROVIDE

00:35:03.768 --> 00:35:06.771
ACCESS TO UNPAID LEAVE BENEFITS

00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:08.473
ARE RELATIVELY LARGER AMONG

00:35:08.539 --> 00:35:10.208
MORE ADVANTAGE HIGHER SKILLED

00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:11.809
WORKERS WHEREAS WHEN WE

00:35:11.876 --> 00:35:13.311
IMPLEMENTED THESE. PAID

00:35:13.377 --> 00:35:15.880
MATERNITY PROGRAMS WE SAW

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:18.916
RELATIVELY LARGER BENEFITS

00:35:18.983 --> 00:35:19.917
AMONG THE LOWER SKILLED LESS

00:35:19.984 --> 00:35:21.085
ADVANTAGED WORKER. AND SO HE

00:35:21.152 --> 00:35:25.089
LEAVE MAY HAVE VERY IMPORTANT

00:35:25.156 --> 00:35:25.656
EQUITY IMPLICATIONS IN THAT

00:35:25.723 --> 00:35:29.627
REGARD. CALIFORNIA'S PAID

00:35:29.694 --> 00:35:30.294
FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM IN

00:35:30.361 --> 00:35:31.028
PARTICULAR ALSO HAS BEEN

00:35:31.095 --> 00:35:31.829
SHIPPED TO HAVE A FAX ONE

00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:32.630
INFANT HEALTH WE SEE INCREASES

00:35:32.697 --> 00:35:34.165
IN- THE AMOUNT OF TIME MOTHER

00:35:34.232 --> 00:35:35.933
SPEND BREAST FEEDING WITH THEM

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:36.901
FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:38.269
CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE.

00:35:38.336 --> 00:35:40.304
A DECREASE IN THE PROBABILITY

00:35:40.371 --> 00:35:41.606
THAT INFANTS ARE HOSPITALIZED

00:35:41.672 --> 00:35:43.708
DUE TO SEVERE. ILLNESS OR

00:35:43.774 --> 00:35:46.277
INFECTION AND A DECREASE IN THE

00:35:46.344 --> 00:35:47.945
LEAGUE VACCINATION RATES SO

00:35:48.012 --> 00:35:49.714
INFANTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:54.485
ON THE RECOMMENDED ROUTINE

00:35:54.552 --> 00:35:56.721
VACCINATION SCHEDULE THAT NOT

00:35:56.787 --> 00:36:01.659
ONLY HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS.

00:36:01.726 --> 00:36:04.929
CARRY ON LONGER AND LIFE A NEW

00:36:04.996 --> 00:36:07.732
WORKING A NEW PAPER SHOWS THAT.

00:36:07.798 --> 00:36:09.967
INFANTS EXPOSED TO PAID FAMILY

00:36:10.034 --> 00:36:12.069
LEAVE HAVE IMPROVED HEALTH IN

00:36:12.136 --> 00:36:13.738
KINDERGARTEN THROUGH A LOWER-

00:36:13.804 --> 00:36:15.439
PROBABILITY OF. BEING OVER

00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:18.342
WEIGHT- LESS LIKELY TO HAVE

00:36:18.409 --> 00:36:21.379
HEARING PROBLEMS AND ALSO LESS

00:36:21.445 --> 00:36:22.413
LIKELY TO BE A NOTE DIAGNOSED

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.383
WITH ADHD. EACH OF THESE HEALTH

00:36:25.449 --> 00:36:27.685
OUTCOMES- IT CAN BE CORRELATED

00:36:27.752 --> 00:36:29.020
WITH THE SHORT RUN DEFECTS AND

00:36:29.086 --> 00:36:30.988
HEALTH THAT WE SEE PRIMARILY

00:36:31.055 --> 00:36:33.624
THROUGH BREAST FEEDING AND- A

00:36:33.691 --> 00:36:34.792
DECREASE IN THE PROBABILITY OF

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:36.527
ILLNESS AS A AS A- CHILD. WE

00:36:36.594 --> 00:36:38.429
ALSO SEE THAT PAID FAMILY LEAVE

00:36:38.496 --> 00:36:39.697
INCREASES PARENTAL TIME IN

00:36:39.764 --> 00:36:41.399
CHILD CARE WHICH HAS IMPORTANT

00:36:41.465 --> 00:36:42.767
IMPLICATIONS FOR CHILDREN'S

00:36:42.833 --> 00:36:44.268
HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT. AND

00:36:44.335 --> 00:36:46.203
THIS IS NOT FROM THE UNITED

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:48.372
STATES BUT THE INTRODUCTION OF

00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:50.675
PAID MATERNITY LEAVE IN NORWAY

00:36:50.741 --> 00:36:51.275
IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES HAS

00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:52.376
BEEN SHOWN. TO ACTUALLY HAVE

00:36:52.443 --> 00:36:54.679
SUBSTANTIAL IMPACTS ON THE LONG

00:36:54.745 --> 00:36:55.846
TERM EARNINGS OF THE CHILDREN

00:36:55.913 --> 00:36:57.715
EXPOSED TO THAT LEAVES.

00:36:57.782 --> 00:36:59.550
OBVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA'S POLICY

00:36:59.617 --> 00:37:01.586
IS NOT YET OLD ENOUGH TO LOOK

00:37:01.652 --> 00:37:03.087
AT LONG TERM IMPACTS ON ADULT

00:37:03.154 --> 00:37:06.157
EARNINGS BUT THERE MAY BE ON

00:37:06.223 --> 00:37:09.193
REALIZE BENEFITS IN A FORMAT

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:14.699
THAT WE- CAN'T MEASURE YET.

00:37:14.765 --> 00:37:15.232
FAMILY LEAVE ALTHOUGH HAS

00:37:15.299 --> 00:37:17.268
AFFECTS ON MATERNAL HEALTH.

00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:17.902
BEING MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH AS

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:18.869
WELL AS HYSICAL HEALTH

00:37:18.936 --> 00:37:20.004
EVIDENCE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES

00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:21.472
SHOWS THAT PAID MATERNITY LEAVE

00:37:21.539 --> 00:37:22.139
DECREASES THE NUMBER OF

00:37:22.206 --> 00:37:23.641
INPATIENT HOSPITAL STAY IS

00:37:23.708 --> 00:37:24.575
AMONG MOTHERS IN THE FIRST YEAR

00:37:24.642 --> 00:37:26.611
OF THE CHILD'S LIFE THREE

00:37:26.677 --> 00:37:27.311
DECREASE IN PREGNANCY RELATED

00:37:27.378 --> 00:37:29.747
COMPLICATIONS SO PAID LEAVE IS

00:37:29.814 --> 00:37:31.549
CRITICAL FOR THE RECOVERY OF

00:37:31.616 --> 00:37:33.117
THE MOTHER AS WELL NOT ONLY FOR

00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:35.052
BONDING WITH A NEW CHILD. AND

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:37.054
FINALLY ONE REALLY INTERESTING

00:37:37.121 --> 00:37:38.322
PIECE OF NEW RESEARCH BY ONE OF

00:37:38.389 --> 00:37:40.791
MY CO AUTHORS SUGGEST THAT

00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:42.893
ACTUALLY WHEN YOU IMPLEMENT-

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.663
PAID PATERNITY LEAVE A AND THE

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:47.298
STUDY IS FROM SWEDEN WHEN

00:37:47.365 --> 00:37:49.867
FATHERS CAN TAKE MORE TIME OFF

00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:52.570
IT ACTUALLY IMPROVES MOTHER'S

00:37:52.637 --> 00:37:54.505
MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH AS

00:37:54.572 --> 00:37:55.506
WELL THE MOTHERS BENEFITS NOT

00:37:55.573 --> 00:38:00.411
ON A FROM TIME AT HOME TO

00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:02.780
RECOVER FROM CHILD BIRTH ONE OF

00:38:02.847 --> 00:38:04.882
THEIR CHILD BUT ALSO FROM THIS

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:09.120
SUPPORT NETWORK THAT THEY GET.

00:38:09.186 --> 00:38:15.326
WHEN A- PARENT UP THERE CAN.

00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:16.093
THERE ARE QUITE A BIT OF

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.328
EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTS OF

00:38:17.395 --> 00:38:17.928
CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE

00:38:17.995 --> 00:38:19.630
ON LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES- THERE

00:38:19.697 --> 00:38:20.698
IS RATHER MIXED EVIDENCE ON THE

00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:23.367
FX ON LONG TERM EMPLOYMENT AND

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:24.869
WAGE TRAJECTORIES OF MOTHERS.

00:38:24.935 --> 00:38:25.403
SEVERAL PAPER SHALL WHEN

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:26.237
LOOKING AT CALIFORNIA'S PAID

00:38:26.303 --> 00:38:26.804
FAMILY LEAVE OVER KIND OF A

00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:27.938
LONGER HER RISE THEN THAT THERE

00:38:28.005 --> 00:38:29.306
ARE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON

00:38:29.373 --> 00:38:30.041
EMPLOYMENT AND SMALL POSITIVE

00:38:30.107 --> 00:38:32.309
EFFECTS ON WAGES. HOWEVER A NEW

00:38:32.376 --> 00:38:34.645
RECENT WORKING PAPER THAT USES

00:38:34.712 --> 00:38:36.681
FEDERAL TAX DATA SHOWS THAT

00:38:36.747 --> 00:38:38.582
CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE

00:38:38.649 --> 00:38:41.318
IS ASSOCIATED WITH- NEGATIVE

00:38:41.385 --> 00:38:42.553
EFFECTS ON EMPLOYMENT AND WAGES

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:45.356
IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM. ONE

00:38:45.423 --> 00:38:47.625
IMPORTANT CAVEAT I THINK THAT

00:38:47.692 --> 00:38:48.159
MAY EXPLAIN PART OF THOSE

00:38:48.225 --> 00:38:49.860
DIFFERENCES THIS THAT IS. IS

00:38:49.927 --> 00:38:53.531
THAT THIS NEW PAPER- ONLY LOOKS

00:38:53.597 --> 00:38:56.467
AT AT MOTHER'S TO CLEAN IF YOU

00:38:56.534 --> 00:38:58.836
BELIEVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER

00:38:58.903 --> 00:39:00.705
THAT IT BECAME AVAILABLE WHO

00:39:00.771 --> 00:39:02.306
GAVE BIRTH MADE A CLAIM. IN

00:39:02.373 --> 00:39:06.677
JULY. SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND

00:39:06.744 --> 00:39:07.211
FOUR YOU MIGHT THINK THERE

00:39:07.278 --> 00:39:10.815
ISN'T BELIEVE. EITHER THE

00:39:10.881 --> 00:39:12.483
MOTHER OR TO LOOK UP LEAVE AS

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.418
SOON AS IT BECAME OF IT. A

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:15.586
WOULD BE SELECTED DIFFERENTLY

00:39:15.653 --> 00:39:16.287
THAN THE AVERAGE MOTHER WHO

00:39:16.353 --> 00:39:18.155
CLAIMS TODAY OR THAT THERE ARE

00:39:18.222 --> 00:39:20.524
DIFFERENTIAL- COSTS ARE STIGMAS

00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:22.993
ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEAVE WHEN

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.695
IT WAS VERY FIRST INTRODUCED AS

00:39:24.762 --> 00:39:26.897
OPPOSED TO TODAY- SO THAT'S

00:39:26.964 --> 00:39:28.099
JUST ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND

00:39:28.165 --> 00:39:29.233
WHEN THINKING ABOUT THAT

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:30.735
RESULT. WE DON'T SEE ANY OF A

00:39:30.801 --> 00:39:33.037
FAN- AVENUE ANY EVIDENCE OF

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:35.072
POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE EFFECTS-

00:39:35.139 --> 00:39:36.907
ON EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES OUR

00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:38.275
FATHERS BUT I WILL EMPHASIZE

00:39:38.342 --> 00:39:39.610
TAKE UP IS QUITE LOW SO IT'S

00:39:39.677 --> 00:39:41.278
MUCH HARDER TO IDENTIFY THE

00:39:41.345 --> 00:39:43.147
FACTS. THE DURATION OF LEAVE

00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:44.749
THAT FATHERS TAKE EVEN WHEN

00:39:44.815 --> 00:39:45.750
THEY TAKE IT IS SO MUCH SHORTER

00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:48.052
THAN IT IS FOR MOTHERS. AND

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:48.619
FINALLY WE'RE QUITE WORRIED

00:39:48.686 --> 00:39:50.888
ABOUT AFFECTS ON FIRM- I THINK

00:39:50.955 --> 00:39:52.323
THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT

00:39:52.389 --> 00:39:53.657
THERE ARE AT LEAST NON NEGATIVE

00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:55.826
UP- AFFECTS ON THE PRODUCTIVITY

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:59.063
OR WAGE COSTS THAT FIRMS FACE

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:00.898
QUITE A BIT OF SURVEY EVIDENCE.

00:40:00.965 --> 00:40:02.800
EXISTS NOW BUT SUGGEST THAT

00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:04.902
FIRMS DO NOT VIEW THESE

00:40:04.969 --> 00:40:07.738
POLICIES THAT'S COST AT LEAST

00:40:07.805 --> 00:40:08.439
ONCE THEY'VE ACTUALLY

00:40:08.506 --> 00:40:10.074
IMPLEMENTED. THIS YEAR IS

00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:12.042
ACTION FROM CALIFORNIA- USING A

00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:13.110
MINUTE STRAIGHT OF DATA AND

00:40:13.177 --> 00:40:15.846
SHOWS- IT JUST ON THE LEFT

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:18.649
ACCESS IN THE BLUE LINE- THE

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:20.584
PER EMPLOYEE WAGE COSTS OF

00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:22.186
EMPLOYERS ON AVERAGE PLOTTED

00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:24.455
AGAINST THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE

00:40:24.522 --> 00:40:27.057
TAKE UP RATES THE RED LINE IS-

00:40:27.124 --> 00:40:29.326
FOR MOTHERS. AND YOU CAN SEE

00:40:29.393 --> 00:40:32.263
THERE'S REALLY NO EVIDENCE THAT

00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:36.801
WE EACH COST. INCREASE WHEN. IF

00:40:36.867 --> 00:40:41.906
INTER. FINALLY ALL AND JUST

00:40:41.972 --> 00:40:43.574
TALKING A BIT ABOUT SOME OF MY-

00:40:43.641 --> 00:40:44.175
NEW RESEARCH WHICH SUGGESTS

00:40:44.241 --> 00:40:45.409
THAT. HIGHER QUALITY FIRMS HAVE

00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:46.610
CONSIDERABLY HIGHER CLEAN RATES

00:40:46.677 --> 00:40:47.645
THAN LOWER QUALITY FIRMS AND

00:40:47.711 --> 00:40:48.279
THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE

00:40:48.345 --> 00:40:49.380
OVERALL I THINK PAID FAMILY

00:40:49.446 --> 00:40:49.980
LEAVE APPEARS TO HAVE A QUITE

00:40:50.047 --> 00:40:51.649
HIGH BENEFITS COMPARED TO ITS

00:40:51.715 --> 00:40:53.851
COST. BUT WE NEED TO BE VERY

00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:54.952
CAREFUL AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED

00:40:55.019 --> 00:40:56.086
EARLIER IN THINKING ABOUT

00:40:56.153 --> 00:40:58.389
BARRIERS TO TAKE UP AN EQUITY

00:40:58.455 --> 00:41:00.624
IN ACCESS TO THIS LEAVE. MY

00:41:00.691 --> 00:41:02.827
WORK ON FIRM QUALITY SUGGEST

00:41:02.893 --> 00:41:04.829
THAT NOT ONLY DO HIGHER QUALITY

00:41:04.895 --> 00:41:06.463
FIRMS HIRE LEAVE TAKING RATES

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:07.865
IN GENERAL. BUT THERE ARE

00:41:07.932 --> 00:41:10.201
BETTER ABLE TO GET RID OF SOME

00:41:10.267 --> 00:41:11.802
OF THIS INEQUALITY IN ACCESS OF

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:15.406
BY- WORKER- INCOME LEVEL OR

00:41:15.472 --> 00:41:18.209
WORKER EARNINGS. SO WHAT THIS

00:41:18.275 --> 00:41:20.110
FIGURE SHOWS IN THE BLUE BARS

00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:22.546
IS THE IN THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS

00:41:22.613 --> 00:41:25.015
BY WORKERS IN SCHOOL TELL EACH

00:41:25.082 --> 00:41:25.916
25% OF THE EARNINGS

00:41:25.983 --> 00:41:28.085
DISTRIBUTION SO ONE OF THE

00:41:28.152 --> 00:41:31.789
LOWEST EARNERS AND FOUR IS THE

00:41:31.856 --> 00:41:36.493
HIGHEST EARNERS BY FIRM. AND

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.461
THE RED BAR SHOW HOW MUCH THE

00:41:37.528 --> 00:41:38.462
CLEAN- THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS IN

00:41:38.529 --> 00:41:38.996
THE FIRM FOR EACH OF THESE

00:41:39.063 --> 00:41:40.564
GROUPS WOULD GO UP. IF WE MOVED

00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:43.100
ALL FIRMS TO BEING ONE STANDARD

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:46.303
DEVIATION HIGHER QUALITY AND SO

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:47.538
WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS AGAIN

00:41:47.605 --> 00:41:48.939
NOT ONLY ARE THE CLAIM RATES

00:41:49.006 --> 00:41:50.241
FOR BETTER QUALITY FIRMS MUCH

00:41:50.307 --> 00:41:51.909
HIGHER. BUT YOU GET RID OF A

00:41:51.976 --> 00:41:54.378
LOT OF THE INEQUALITY IN ACCESS

00:41:54.445 --> 00:41:56.747
PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE LOWEST

00:41:56.814 --> 00:41:59.917
EARNING WORKERS. THANK YOU.

00:41:59.984 --> 00:42:01.819
THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THIS IS A

00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:04.088
SHOULD BE TIME FOR QUESTIONS ON

00:42:04.154 --> 00:42:05.689
THIS FIRST PANEL IF ANYONE HAS

00:42:05.756 --> 00:42:09.059
ONE. BUT WE SIR WITH THE. I

00:42:09.126 --> 00:42:10.327
HAVE A FOR SURE THIS OF.

00:42:10.394 --> 00:42:12.563
CONVENING IS AN IT'S OKAY IF

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:13.130
YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER

00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:14.298
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU TO

00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:15.266
HAVE TO KNOW LIKE ALL THE

00:42:15.332 --> 00:42:16.433
STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.236
BUT- YOU KNOW WE- WE OBVIOUSLY

00:42:19.303 --> 00:42:22.306
ARE TRYING TO GET TO TWELVE.

00:42:22.373 --> 00:42:25.075
WEEKS IN CALIFORNIA. IS THERE-

00:42:25.142 --> 00:42:27.011
ANY OUT OF THAT SUGGEST WHAT

00:42:27.077 --> 00:42:28.379
THE ACTUAL IDEAL TIME AS I'M

00:42:28.445 --> 00:42:30.781
ASSUME THAT. YOU KNOW THERE'S-

00:42:30.848 --> 00:42:32.883
GOT TO BE. IT'S PROBABLY MORE

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:34.685
THAN TWELVE WEEKS DEFINITELY

00:42:34.752 --> 00:42:35.953
MORE THAN WE HAVE NOW SIX WEEKS

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.622
EIGHT WEEKS. BUT AT SOME POINT

00:42:38.689 --> 00:42:39.690
YOU KNOW WOMEN WHO WANT TO

00:42:39.757 --> 00:42:41.458
REENTER THE ROOM FOR SOME STUFF

00:42:41.525 --> 00:42:42.559
IS THERE ANY STUDY THAT

00:42:42.626 --> 00:42:43.527
SUGGESTS WITH THAT IDEAL TIME

00:42:43.594 --> 00:42:46.897
AS- THERE IS NOT A STUDY THAT

00:42:46.964 --> 00:42:47.631
KIND OF CONCLUSIVELY SUGGESTS

00:42:47.698 --> 00:42:50.034
WHAT AN IDEAL. STATION IS WHAT

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.703
I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT. A

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.539
POSITIVE HELD A FAX EMERGE

00:42:55.606 --> 00:42:59.710
FAIRLY EARLY- BUT THAT'S NOT TO

00:42:59.777 --> 00:43:00.344
SAY THERE AREN'T BIGGER HEALTH

00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:03.013
EFFECTS IF YOU EXTEND. LEAVE

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.214
LONGER IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT

00:43:04.281 --> 00:43:06.684
WHAT WE KNOW FROM EUROPE- SO

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:08.385
TAKE THIS WITH A LITTLE BIT OF

00:43:08.452 --> 00:43:09.520
A GRAIN OF SALT BECAUSE EUROPE

00:43:09.586 --> 00:43:10.921
AND THE UNITED STATES OF

00:43:10.988 --> 00:43:12.389
PARTICULARLY THE SCANDINAVIAN

00:43:12.456 --> 00:43:13.958
COUNTRIES IN THE UNITED STATES

00:43:14.024 --> 00:43:15.192
ARE NOT DIRECTLY COMPATIBLE IN

00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:18.195
MANY OTHER. WAYS BUT- WHAT WE

00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:20.898
SEE FROM EUROPE IS THAT LEAVES

00:43:20.965 --> 00:43:26.170
LONGER THAN ABOUT A YEAR. START

00:43:26.236 --> 00:43:26.737
TO HAVE NEGATIVE EMPLOYMENT

00:43:26.804 --> 00:43:29.740
CONSEQUENCE. WHERE LEAVE

00:43:29.807 --> 00:43:31.342
SHORTER IN THE YEAR IN GENERAL

00:43:31.408 --> 00:43:31.775
DO NOT HAVE NEGATIVE

00:43:31.842 --> 00:43:32.543
EMPLOYMENT. QUINCES ARE LARGE

00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:33.477
COSTS ON FIRMS TO THE BEST THAT

00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:35.079
WE CAN IDENTIFY. IN THAT RANGE

00:43:35.145 --> 00:43:36.547
FROM ABOUT THREE MONTHS TO A

00:43:36.613 --> 00:43:40.451
YEAR WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A

00:43:40.517 --> 00:43:41.018
SENSE OF WHAT THE IDEAL LIFE

00:43:41.085 --> 00:43:42.753
AND NOT. AND ONE MORE QUESTION

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:45.089
SURE IT'S OKAY. WE TALKED ABOUT

00:43:45.155 --> 00:43:48.625
THE WAGE CEILING ON WHAT THE

00:43:48.692 --> 00:43:51.829
ONE HURT OR WHAT 1% WE'LL CALL

00:43:51.895 --> 00:43:54.665
IT I KNOW THERE'S- 10% THE ONLY

00:43:54.732 --> 00:43:56.033
WAY AND THAT- THAT WE'RE GIVING

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.134
AT THAT WE'RE TAKING FROM

00:43:57.201 --> 00:43:58.936
PEOPLE'S PAYCHECK BASICALLY TO

00:43:59.003 --> 00:44:00.571
FUND THIS PROGRAM CALIFORNIA'S

00:44:00.637 --> 00:44:02.539
THAT YOU SAID ABOUT ONE

00:44:02.606 --> 00:44:04.241
EIGHTEEN SOME STATES GO UP TO

00:44:04.308 --> 00:44:04.842
ONE THIRTY THREE IS THAT THE

00:44:04.908 --> 00:44:06.977
HIGHEST HAS ANYONE SUGGESTED. I

00:44:07.044 --> 00:44:08.245
MEAN IF YOU WANT A PROGRESSIVE

00:44:08.312 --> 00:44:09.713
APPROACH THAT SEEMS LIKE WE

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.715
COULD GO TO ONE FIFTY THOUSAND

00:44:11.782 --> 00:44:13.250
DOLLARS WITHOUT MUCH OF FACT

00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:15.252
WRECKED SO I WOULD KNOW THAT

00:44:15.319 --> 00:44:16.053
THE DESERT OF COLUMBIA IT

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.222
ACTUALLY DOES NOT HAVE A WAGE

00:44:18.288 --> 00:44:19.857
CEILING. ON THEIR PROGRAM AND

00:44:19.923 --> 00:44:21.291
THEN THE STATE'S WITH ONE

00:44:21.358 --> 00:44:22.459
THIRTY THREE THAT'S ACTUALLY

00:44:22.526 --> 00:44:24.595
THE UNTOUCHABLE WAGE BASE FOR

00:44:24.661 --> 00:44:28.332
SOCIAL SECURITY. SO SOME STATES

00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:28.966
HAVE JUST PASTED ACTION UP WITH

00:44:29.033 --> 00:44:31.368
ADEQUATE. THAT WILL NOTE THAT

00:44:31.435 --> 00:44:33.003
THE GOVERNORS OF. COMMITTEE ON

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:33.904
THE ISSUE HAS BROUGHT UP THIS

00:44:33.971 --> 00:44:34.772
ISSUE AND TAKING A LOOK LOOK AT

00:44:34.838 --> 00:44:35.706
IT. THEIR FORTUNES SIDE OF HIS

00:44:35.773 --> 00:44:37.107
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF WORKERS UP

00:44:37.174 --> 00:44:38.609
IN THAT STRATA. AND SO THE

00:44:38.675 --> 00:44:40.878
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S

00:44:40.944 --> 00:44:41.512
COLLECTED HE DOESN'T. PAY FOR A

00:44:41.578 --> 00:44:44.248
WHOLE LOT OF BENEFIT. OF

00:44:44.314 --> 00:44:47.651

FAMILIES AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH

AND THE WORK FORCE I THINK A

00:45:14.244 --> 00:45:15.913
STABLE WORKFORCE THAT'S ONE OF

00:45:15.979 --> 00:45:16.346
THE THINGS YOU DON'T

00:45:16.413 --> 00:45:18.615
NECESSARILY TALK ABOUT TOO MUCH

00:45:18.682 --> 00:45:20.284
BUT YOU KNOW IT'S HARD FOR

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:22.352
EMPLOYERS TO GET ON STAY ON IT

00:45:22.419 --> 00:45:23.754
SO HAVING A STABLE WORKFORCE IS

00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:26.557
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SO I GET

ALL THAT THANKS FOR LETTING US

00:45:28.358 --> 00:45:29.793
OF A I HAVE TWO ISSUES I WANT

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:36.300
TO FOCUS ON SO FIRST. THE STATE

00:45:36.366 --> 00:45:36.800
IT SAID THIS IS A PUBLIC

00:45:36.867 --> 00:45:39.670

AT. THE SAME BENEFITS ARE FOR

00:45:40.571 --> 00:45:41.738
PEOPLE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

AND THE PUBLIC- HAS THIS. WE

00:45:43.674 --> 00:45:45.409
KNOW THAT STATE AGENCIES. VERY

00:45:45.476 --> 00:45:46.310
FEW PEOPLE HERE IN THE CAPITAL

00:45:46.376 --> 00:45:47.644
KNOW THAT THE STATE SENATE'S

00:45:47.711 --> 00:45:48.712
LIKE THE ENVY OF. STATE

00:45:48.779 --> 00:45:49.713
WORKFORCE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.315

00:45:51.381 --> 00:45:53.016
SENATOR STATE ASSEMBLY

00:45:53.083 --> 00:45:54.151
LEGISLATIVE STAFF MEMBER. THE

00:45:54.218 --> 00:45:55.786
TIME YOU HAVE TO. BOND WITH

00:45:55.853 --> 00:45:57.387
YOUR NEWBORN VERY VERY

00:45:57.454 --> 00:45:59.490
GENEROUS. SO WHAT HAS THE STATE

00:45:59.556 --> 00:46:02.126
DOWN TO YOU KNOW MY DISTRICT

00:46:02.192 --> 00:46:03.093
HAS PLENTY OF STATE WORKERS.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:05.129
YOU KNOW. TENS OF THOUSANDS SO

00:46:05.195 --> 00:46:06.864
WHAT DO WE DO TO MAKE SURE WE

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:09.867
HAVE. SOME UNIFORMITY IN THAT

00:46:09.933 --> 00:46:11.935
AMONG THE STATE AGENCIES.

00:46:12.002 --> 00:46:14.171
NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO. AS WE

00:46:14.238 --> 00:46:17.274
LOOK AT. EXPANSION AND FOR ALL

00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:20.377
WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:21.278
WHAT WE NEED TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE

00:46:21.345 --> 00:46:23.347
YOU KNOW WHAT TIMES. PEOPLE SAY

00:46:23.413 --> 00:46:24.681
WELL YOU PASSED LAWS IN PASSED

00:46:24.748 --> 00:46:27.050
UPON NOT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING

00:46:27.117 --> 00:46:29.686
CALIFORNIA.TO STEP IT UP AND

00:46:29.753 --> 00:46:35.392
BY EXAMPLE. SOME COULD DRESS UP

00:46:35.459 --> 00:46:39.763
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. LOW ONE

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:40.998
THOUSAND BARGAIN FOR- THE RIGHT

00:46:41.064 --> 00:46:41.999
TO STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE

00:46:42.065 --> 00:46:42.799
UNPAID LEAVE US AN EXTENSION OF

00:46:42.866 --> 00:46:43.367
THAT. I CAN'T REMEMBER THE

00:46:43.433 --> 00:46:44.001
EXACT YEAR- AND THAT CONCLUDES

00:46:44.067 --> 00:46:45.669
THE- VAST MAJORITY OF STATE

00:46:45.736 --> 00:46:46.603
EMPLOYEES THERE OTHER

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:48.005
BARGAINING UNITS WITHIN STATE

00:46:48.071 --> 00:46:49.873
GOVERNMENT. I THAT HAVE NOT

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:53.510
BARGAINED FOR- THAT BENEFIT-

00:46:53.577 --> 00:46:55.646
AND SO THEY DON'T RECEIVE THE

00:46:55.712 --> 00:46:57.948
BENEFIT- WHAT I WILL TELL YOU

00:46:58.015 --> 00:46:59.883
CONTRACT ISSUE NOT A- STATE

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:01.785
POLICY EXACTLY RIGHT IN THE LAW

00:47:01.852 --> 00:47:03.554
THAT ALLOWS- ALL PUBLIC

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:06.957
EMPLOYEES TO BARGAIN. OF FOR

00:47:07.024 --> 00:47:07.558
THAT I THINK THAT THERE WAS A

00:47:07.624 --> 00:47:10.027
LEGISLATION. EARLIER LAST

00:47:10.093 --> 00:47:11.595
EARLIER THIS YEAR- THAT SPOKE

00:47:11.662 --> 00:47:12.663
TO TEACHERS AND THEIR ABILITY

00:47:12.729 --> 00:47:14.031
TO GOT IT AND IT'S LEFT OPEN

00:47:14.097 --> 00:47:17.501
TO- THEIR BARGAINING ABILITY-

00:47:17.568 --> 00:47:18.135
TO REAP BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THAT

00:47:18.202 --> 00:47:22.005
BENEFIT. AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL

00:47:22.072 --> 00:47:24.775
I'M EXCITED TO SAY THAT- STATE

00:47:24.841 --> 00:47:27.477
SUPERVISORS FINALLY HAVE A NOT

00:47:27.544 --> 00:47:31.748
EXACTLY- WHAT- STI AND PAID

00:47:31.815 --> 00:47:33.784
FAMILY LEAVE PROVIDE- BUT WERE

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:37.487
NOW- SUPERVISORS ABLE TO GET-

00:47:37.554 --> 00:47:38.855
AT LEAST PARTIAL WAGE

00:47:38.922 --> 00:47:40.857
REPLACEMENT FOR TIME OFF. OF

00:47:40.924 --> 00:47:43.060
FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE SO WE

00:47:43.126 --> 00:47:44.461
HAVE TAKEN JUST RECENTLY SOME

00:47:44.528 --> 00:47:46.763
STEPS TOWARDS A- BUT IT'S A

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:48.165
VERY MUCH LEFT UP TO THE

00:47:48.232 --> 00:47:49.499
INDIVIDUAL BARGAINING UNITS TO

00:47:49.566 --> 00:47:50.968
MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THE

00:47:51.034 --> 00:47:54.037
WORKERS- ON HOW THEY WANT TO-

00:47:54.104 --> 00:47:54.905
READ WHETHER NOT THEY WANT TO

00:47:54.972 --> 00:47:56.106
RECEIVE THIS BENEFIT OR NOT.

00:47:56.173 --> 00:47:58.542
THE SECOND QUESTION IS IN TWO

00:47:58.609 --> 00:47:59.610
THOUSAND TWO FORD WE WEREN'T

00:47:59.676 --> 00:48:01.111
THE LEADER IN THIS AND AS YOU

00:48:01.178 --> 00:48:03.113
SEE FROM THE CHART. OTHER

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.048
STATES HAVE HAVE STEPPED UP AND

00:48:05.115 --> 00:48:07.851
SURPASSED OUR OUR OUR TIME

00:48:07.918 --> 00:48:10.621
FRAME THERE WE HAVE LEGISLATORS

00:48:10.687 --> 00:48:13.257
PUSH THE ENVELOPE FOR ALL ALL

00:48:13.323 --> 00:48:15.392
ALL WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. SO

00:48:15.459 --> 00:48:17.094
HAVE WE EVER AS A STATE THOUGHT

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.162
ABOUT HEY WELL YOU KNOW YOU

00:48:19.229 --> 00:48:20.230
KNOW YOU COULD DO A BILL INSIDE

00:48:20.297 --> 00:48:21.198
SOMETHING A LOT STATUE THAT.

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:23.267
EVERYBODY BUT WHAT ABOUT. THE

00:48:23.333 --> 00:48:25.535
STATE WORK FORCE HAS THAT EVER

00:48:25.602 --> 00:48:27.671
BEEN ON THE TABLE. I HAVE I DO

00:48:27.738 --> 00:48:30.540
NOT KNOW OF A- SINGLE PIECE OF

00:48:30.607 --> 00:48:32.776
LEGISLATION THAT'S BEEN ON- THE

00:48:32.843 --> 00:48:34.645
TABLE. OF BECAUSE IT'S A

00:48:34.711 --> 00:48:35.646
BARGAIN MOBILE RIGHT I THINK

00:48:35.712 --> 00:48:36.580
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN

00:48:36.647 --> 00:48:40.417
ABOUT- UNION- RIGHTS AND- RIGHT

00:48:40.484 --> 00:48:41.885
AROUND WHAT IS COLLECTIVELY

00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:42.819
BARGAIN WHAT IS NOT

00:48:42.886 --> 00:48:44.855
COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN- BUT TO MY

00:48:44.921 --> 00:48:46.523
KNOWLEDGE I HAVE NOT SEEN IT. I

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:47.491
WOULD ALSO BE REMISS IF I

00:48:47.557 --> 00:48:49.793
DIDN'T SAY THAT WHILE DURATION

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.162
IS ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT GOES

00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:53.930
INTO THIS BENEFIT. THERE ARE

00:48:53.997 --> 00:48:55.365
LOTS OF OTHER. PARTS AND

00:48:55.432 --> 00:48:57.634
PARCELS AGAIN A STATE

00:48:57.701 --> 00:48:59.770
DISABILITY INSURANCE IS A FIFTY

00:48:59.836 --> 00:49:01.571
TWO WEEK LONG TEMPORARY

00:49:01.638 --> 00:49:04.007
DISABILITY INSURANCE BENEFITS.

00:49:04.074 --> 00:49:05.942
AND WHILE IT DOES NOT INCLUDE.

00:49:06.009 --> 00:49:08.011
FUNDING IS USE FOR BIRTH

00:49:08.078 --> 00:49:11.682
MOTHERS- GENERALLY AFTER ABOUT

00:49:11.748 --> 00:49:12.716
TEN WEEKS BUT CAN BE USE FOR

00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:14.785
MUCH LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. AND

00:49:14.851 --> 00:49:17.921
THAT'S A MUCH BETTER BENEFIT-

00:49:17.988 --> 00:49:22.659
THEN I. THINK JUST ABOUT ANY

00:49:22.726 --> 00:49:23.260
OTHER STATE THAT I'VE SEEN. SO

00:49:23.327 --> 00:49:28.332
WHEN. LOOKING AT THIS BENEFIT

00:49:28.398 --> 00:49:29.700
IN PARTICULAR WHEN IT COMES TO-

00:49:29.766 --> 00:49:31.168
CHILDBIRTH I DO BELIEVE THAT

00:49:31.234 --> 00:49:32.102
YOU NEED TO TAKE A LOOK- AS

IT REALLY VARIES BY STATE BUT

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:50.947
IT'S EITHER ALL EMPLOYEE FUNDED

00:50:51.014 --> 00:50:53.016
LIKE CALIFORNIA OR COMBINATION

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:55.519

FUND IT'S ALL BASED UPON THE

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:07.931
MODEL FOR THE. BASICALLY YES

00:51:07.998 --> 00:51:08.698
BUT THIS WOMAN IN A- DESOLATE

DO THE OUTRAGE. AND THAT'S THE

00:51:14.604 --> 00:51:16.373
GENERAL FUND DOLLARS NIGHT OF

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:17.340
MONEY COMING OUT OF. TO BE

00:51:17.407 --> 00:51:19.576
CLEAR IT IS THIS AD IN RESPONSE

00:51:19.643 --> 00:51:21.611
THAT LAST QUESTION. IS THE

00:51:21.678 --> 00:51:23.079
MONEY DOES THE MONEY COME FROM

00:51:30.887 --> 00:51:32.756
OUT RETURN MINISTRATION. MY

00:51:32.823 --> 00:51:34.791

WHO ARE IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY

00:51:54.211 --> 00:51:55.512
IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND FOR IF

00:51:55.579 --> 00:51:56.847
YOU HAVE A FULL TIME JOB FOR

00:51:56.913 --> 00:51:57.981
THE STATE TO WORK FOR. IN OUR

QUITE FULL TIME MULTIPLE JOBS

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:06.556
AND SO. IS IT JUST REALLY

00:52:06.623 --> 00:52:07.591
COMPLICATED FOR PEOPLE TO

00:52:07.657 --> 00:52:09.125

WE SAW RIGHT SO HOW DO WE

00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:22.906
ATTRIBUTE THAT AND WHAT WHAT WE

00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:24.741
NEED TO DO TO ADDRESS THAT.

00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:26.643
WHAT A MARKET RESEARCH REPORT

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:27.244
THAT WAS COMMISSIONED BY THE

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:28.378
PLYMOUTH DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT

00:52:28.445 --> 00:52:31.114
MANY. WORKERS INDICATED THAT

00:52:31.181 --> 00:52:33.116
JOB PROTECTIONS FOR A BARRIER

00:52:33.183 --> 00:52:34.951
TO ACCESSING PAID FAMILY LEAVE.

00:52:35.018 --> 00:52:36.419
AS WELL AS THE WAY TO PLACEMENT

00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:39.089
RATES NOW THIS REPORT WAS DONE.

00:52:39.155 --> 00:52:39.923
A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO AND IT

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.491
WAS DONE ACTUALLY BEFORE WE

00:52:41.558 --> 00:52:43.093
BOOSTED THE RATES FOR VERY LOW

00:52:43.159 --> 00:52:45.228
WAGE WORKERS. AS THE DIRECTOR

00:52:45.295 --> 00:52:46.663

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:50.834
INCREASE AND TAKE UP RATES- SO

00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:51.434
I THINK THOSE TWO BARRIERS ARE

00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:54.604
VERY. THE VERY IMPORTANT TO

00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:56.439
CONSIDER WHEN THINKING ABOUT

00:52:56.506 --> 00:52:56.907
LOWER WAGE WORKERS IN

00:52:56.973 --> 00:53:00.377
PARTICULAR THEY ALSO THINK. JOB

00:53:00.443 --> 00:53:02.078
PROTECTIONS AND THE FACT THAT

00:53:02.145 --> 00:53:04.147
THERE ARE FOUR. LAWS UNDER

00:53:04.214 --> 00:53:06.516
WHICH A WORKER COULD HAVE JOB

00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:08.418
PROTECTED LEAVE IS PROBABLY

00:53:08.485 --> 00:53:08.952
REALLY CONFUSING FOR EVERY

00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:12.255
WORKER. AND OFTEN TIMES EVERY

00:53:12.322 --> 00:53:15.191
LEGISLATORS AT WHAT EXACTLY I

00:53:15.258 --> 00:53:16.560

00:53:16.626 --> 00:53:18.395
TABLE IN THE REPORT THAT TRIES

00:53:18.461 --> 00:53:19.195
TO LAY OUT THE COMPLEXITY OF

00:53:19.262 --> 00:53:21.197
THOSE THINK SENDING. AN

WAGE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S

00:53:37.814 --> 00:53:38.949

WE- REACH FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:43.186

00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:22.612
THAT'LL ON- I THINK IT IS I'M

00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:24.080
LOOKING AT YOUR CHICHI THERE

00:56:24.147 --> 00:56:26.282
BUT I THINK IT'S RHODE ISLAND-

00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:28.785
WHO REALLY FOCUSED ON ELDER

00:56:28.852 --> 00:56:30.787
CARE. OF FROM THE START OF

00:56:30.854 --> 00:56:33.389
THEIR PROGRAM- FRANKLY I THINK

00:56:33.456 --> 00:56:37.827
IT'S BECAUSE OF THE LACK FUND

00:56:37.894 --> 00:56:41.765
WE HAD TO DO- FOR OUTRAGE WE

00:56:41.831 --> 00:56:42.565
REACHED OUT TO A LOT OF THE

00:56:42.632 --> 00:56:45.235
HOSPITALS TALK TO THEM ABOUT.

00:56:45.301 --> 00:56:47.137
BENEFIT TO- NEW PERSON

00:56:47.203 --> 00:56:50.106
FATHER'S. INITIALLY UP BUTTON

00:56:50.173 --> 00:56:52.876
HONESTLY. I TO TAKE IT APART.

00:56:52.942 --> 00:56:54.377
THE OF MONEY THAT'S BEEN

00:56:54.444 --> 00:56:55.011
APPROPRIATED TO THE DEPARTMENT

00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:56.746
MOVING FORWARD. AND MAKE SURE

00:56:56.813 --> 00:56:59.182
THAT WE DO AND- I'LL REACH. TWO

00:56:59.249 --> 00:57:00.416
TYPICALLY TO THE FOLKS THAT ARE

00:57:00.483 --> 00:57:06.923
IN THE CARE AND MAKE. SURE THAT

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.490
THEY KNOW THAT THAT'S THERE

00:57:07.557 --> 00:57:14.063
pOF THOSE GROUPS BECAUSE THERE

00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:14.931
AREN'TAS MANY FRANKLY AS

00:57:14.998 --> 00:57:15.632
ESTABLISHED AS I'D LIKE TO

00:57:15.698 --> 00:57:17.867
BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE. A RP

00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:18.468
DOES A WONDERFUL JOB AND THEY

00:57:18.535 --> 00:57:20.537
ARE A GOOD PARTNER IN BUT IT'S

00:57:20.603 --> 00:57:21.271
A LITTLE HARDER TO PIN DOWN THE

00:57:21.337 --> 00:57:22.272
ADVOCACY GROUPS- FOR PEOPLE

00:57:22.338 --> 00:57:22.806
LOOKING OF CARE BUT IT IS

00:57:22.872 --> 00:57:23.473
SOMETHING THAT- WE ARE

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:24.207
DEFINITELY LOOKING TO INCREASE

00:57:24.274 --> 00:57:26.109
THE UTILIZATION AROUND. WELL AS

00:57:26.176 --> 00:57:28.178
THE AUTHOR THE BILL TO EXPAND

00:57:28.244 --> 00:57:30.213
NEW BABY BONDING I HOPE THAT WE

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:32.015
ARE GOING TO ROB FROM PETER TO

00:57:32.081 --> 00:57:34.017
PAY PAUL THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:57:34.083 --> 00:57:36.052
RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO DO THESE

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:37.821
PROGRAMS- COLLABORATIVELY AND

00:57:37.887 --> 00:57:40.190
NOT. START COMPETING FOR THOSE

00:57:40.256 --> 00:57:42.358
DOLLARS SO- I'M WONDERING ARE

00:57:42.425 --> 00:57:43.493
THERE IT TO ARE THERE ANY

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.762
STATISTICS ON THE IMPACTS OF

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:47.897
CARING FOR FAMILY MEMBERS. ON

00:57:47.964 --> 00:57:50.300
EMPLOYMENT ON EMPLOYEES VERSUS

00:57:50.366 --> 00:57:54.871
EMPLOYERS IN TERMS OF. THEIR

00:57:54.938 --> 00:57:55.338
THEIR ABILITY TO EARN

00:57:55.405 --> 00:57:58.074
SUFFICIENT FUNDS THE- EMPLOYERS

00:57:58.141 --> 00:57:59.075
HAVING EMPLOYEES WHO WERE

00:57:59.142 --> 00:58:00.510
TAKING THAT KIND OF TIME

00:58:00.577 --> 00:58:02.278
OFFICER BEEN ANY DATA IS FOR

00:58:02.345 --> 00:58:03.680
ANY. ANY ANY STUDY DONE ON THIS

00:58:03.746 --> 00:58:09.285
ISSUE. I DON'T BELIEVE SO AT

00:58:09.352 --> 00:58:10.353
THIS POINT BUT WHAT I WILL TELL

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:13.022
YOU IS THAT- I'M MORE THAN

00:58:13.089 --> 00:58:15.358
HAPPY TO- ASK MISTER WASHINGTON

COULD BUT TO GET BACK TO YOUR

00:58:17.193 --> 00:58:17.760
OFFICE SENATOR OR THE COMMITTEE

00:58:17.827 --> 00:58:21.331
IF YOU FALL PLEASE- ON OUR-

00:58:21.397 --> 00:58:23.600
RATES AND THE DATA THAT WE DO

00:58:23.666 --> 00:58:25.268
COLLECT AROUND BOND- SKEWS ME

00:58:25.335 --> 00:58:26.669
CARE GIVER. I JUST THINK AGAIN

00:58:26.736 --> 00:58:29.138
WITH CALIFORNIA AGING AS IT IS.

00:58:29.205 --> 00:58:30.406
WE'VE GOT TO BE REALISTIC FOR

00:58:30.473 --> 00:58:32.442
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE YOU MENTION

00:58:32.508 --> 00:58:34.344
ARE PHD IS YOU KNOW WE HAVE

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:37.847
FAMILIES. AND WE OF WOMEN FOR

00:58:37.914 --> 00:58:39.649
PRIMARILY HAVE BEEN VIEWED AS

00:58:39.716 --> 00:58:40.617
AND TAKEN THE ROLE OF CARE

00:58:40.683 --> 00:58:45.221
GIVER AND- WE DON'T WANT- IT

00:58:45.288 --> 00:58:46.489
AGAIN FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE TO

00:58:46.556 --> 00:58:49.292
MAKE THESE VERY VERY DIFFICULT

00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:53.329
HOBSON'S CHOICES. SOPHIE'S

00:58:53.396 --> 00:58:54.297
CHOICE IS ACTUALLY ON HOW TO

00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:54.998
CARE FOR THE PEOPLE THEY LOVE

00:58:55.064 --> 00:58:56.866
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN

00:58:56.933 --> 00:58:57.967
CONTINUE TO BE GOOD EMPLOYEES

00:58:58.034 --> 00:58:59.502
AND GOOD WORKERS AND-

00:58:59.569 --> 00:59:02.038
SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR CAREERS SO.

00:59:02.105 --> 00:59:03.439
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE

00:59:03.506 --> 00:59:05.808
INITIAL- ON AUTHOR OF SENATOR

00:59:05.875 --> 00:59:09.545
KEWL. SUPERVISOR COOL- DESIGNED

00:59:09.612 --> 00:59:10.680
FOR THE PROGRAM FOR IS THIS NOT

00:59:10.747 --> 00:59:12.715
JUST FOR ONE INSTANCE IN LIFE-

00:59:12.782 --> 00:59:14.784
BUT IT IS FOR A LIFETIME. OF IN

00:59:14.851 --> 00:59:17.153
INCIDENCES AND IT IS A- IN

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.722
INSURANCE PROGRAM THAT A SOCIAL

00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:22.325
WELFARE PROGRAM FOR WORKERS. I

00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:23.359
THINK THAT'S A GOOD DISTINCTION

00:59:23.426 --> 00:59:23.927
I DO HAVE A WONDER TO OTHER

00:59:23.993 --> 00:59:26.763
QUESTIONS. YOU KNOW WE KNOW THE

00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:28.598
BENEFITS OF FAMILY LEAVE

00:59:28.665 --> 00:59:30.099
WHETHER IT'S FOR CARE GIVING

00:59:30.166 --> 00:59:31.467
FOR SENIORS WHETHER TO BABY

00:59:31.534 --> 00:59:32.769
PLANNING I'M WONDERING ARE YOU

00:59:32.835 --> 00:59:35.605
SEEING MORE EMPLOYERS OFFERING

00:59:35.672 --> 00:59:36.139
THESE KINDS OF FAMILY THE

00:59:36.205 --> 00:59:38.541
BENEFITS ON THEIR OWN- OR IN

00:59:38.608 --> 00:59:39.842
ADDITION TO WHAT CALIFORNIA

00:59:39.909 --> 00:59:41.544
PROVIDES IN COULD YOU TALK A

00:59:41.611 --> 00:59:43.279
LITTLE BIT ABOUT. WHO THEY ARE

00:59:43.346 --> 00:59:46.649
AND WHAT. THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN

00:59:46.716 --> 00:59:49.552
OR WHAT IS INSPIRED THEM TO DO

00:59:49.619 --> 00:59:50.119
THIS. ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN

00:59:50.186 --> 00:59:53.556
ADDRESS. SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO

00:59:53.623 --> 00:59:55.391
CALIFORNIA HERE'S AS

00:59:55.458 --> 00:59:57.560
SPECIFICALLY BUT OVERALL- IN

00:59:57.627 --> 00:59:58.661
THE U. S. IN THE PAST FEW

00:59:58.728 --> 01:00:00.964
YEARS. EMPLOYER PROVIDED PAID

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:02.665
FAMILY LEAVE HAS GONE UP

01:00:02.732 --> 01:00:04.534
CONSIDERABLY IT'S STILL QUITE

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.936
LOW- TODAY ABOUT 20% OF ALL

01:00:07.003 --> 01:00:10.039
WORKERS HAVE ACCESS TO EITHER.

01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:10.640
EMPLOYER PROVIDED MATERNITY OR

01:00:10.707 --> 01:00:14.043
PATERNITY LEAVE. CHARLES WHAT

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:15.278
PROVIDED EMPLOYER EMPLOYER

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:18.448
PROVIDED YES- SO THAT'S GONE UP

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:21.184
FROM LIKE TWELVE PERCENT- YOU

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.186
KNOW A DECADE AGO SO IT'S A BIG

01:00:23.252 --> 01:00:24.020
INCREASE BUT IT'S STILL QUITE

01:00:24.087 --> 01:00:27.457
LOW- IN CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS

01:00:27.523 --> 01:00:30.960
ARE ALLOWED TO TOP OFF YOUR-

01:00:31.027 --> 01:00:33.029
YOUR WAGE REPLACEMENT THAT THE

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:35.264
STATE PROVIDES. TO MY KNOWLEDGE

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:37.200
THERE'S NO GOOD DATA ON HOW

01:00:37.266 --> 01:00:39.869
MANY- HOW MANY EMPLOYERS CHOOSE

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:41.571
TO DO THAT OR YOU SAY OP OFF

01:00:41.637 --> 01:00:42.872
WHAT IS THAT MEANS SO-

01:00:42.939 --> 01:00:47.143
CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM WILL PAY

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:49.679
60% OF YOUR BASE WAGE. YOUR

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:51.280
EMPLOYER CAN TOP THAT UP TO A

01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:53.016
100% OF WHAT YOU WOULD GET SO

01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:56.085
YOU CAN'T BE PAID- MORE THAN

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:57.286
YOU WOULD BE IF YOU WERE JUST

01:00:57.353 --> 01:00:59.088
OUT WORK BUT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:01.758
IT TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE-

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:03.926
MAYBE YOU KNOW BACK. I HAVEN'T

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:05.328
SEEN ANYTHING ON ON HOW COMMON

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:07.363
THAT IS. I WOULD SAY IT'S LOW

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:10.199
INCOME AND WE DO HAVE SOME SELF

01:01:10.266 --> 01:01:12.335
INSURANCE. OF PROGRAMS THAT WE

01:01:12.402 --> 01:01:14.370
CAN GIVE YOU STATISTICS ON IT

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:16.539
IS A VERY LOW NUMBER THE COST

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:18.341
OF INSURANCE IS- OFTENTIMES

01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:21.444
VERY HIGH BECAUSE THE- THE AS I

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:22.311
DESCRIBE THE PROGRAM IS AN

01:01:22.378 --> 01:01:24.213
INSURANCE PROGRAM SO THE POOL.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.049
IS A LOT SMALLER SO THE RISK IS

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:27.917
A LOT HIGHER OF FOR THOSE

01:01:27.984 --> 01:01:30.586
COMPANIES BUT WE DO HAVE AND

01:01:30.653 --> 01:01:32.455
KEEP RECORDS OF THOSE.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:34.991
COMPANIES I'D BE REMISS IF I

01:01:35.058 --> 01:01:39.028
DID NOT KNOW THAT- I BELIEVE LA

01:01:39.095 --> 01:01:41.097
CITY IS ON ITS WAY TO BUT SAN

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:43.199
FRANCISCO- CITY DID PASS AN

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:46.436
ORDINANCE ALLOWING FOR. I

01:01:46.502 --> 01:01:47.437
BELIEVE IT'S UP 290% OF WAIT

01:01:47.503 --> 01:01:51.374
REPLACEMENT- THAT THE- CITY

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:53.209
MANDATES ALL EMPLOYERS MAKE UP

01:01:53.276 --> 01:01:57.046
THE DIFFERENCE FOR. OKAY WELL A

01:01:57.113 --> 01:02:02.151
LAST QUESTION- AND THAT REALLY

01:02:02.218 --> 01:02:08.458
NEED TO DO BETTER FEW. XIN OF

01:02:08.524 --> 01:02:10.526
HOW WE COULD GO ABOUT BOTH FOR-

01:02:10.593 --> 01:02:11.828
NEW BOOK NEW IN A BABY BONDING

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:12.829
AND AS WELL AS FAMILY LEAVE A

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:13.329
COUPLE THINGS THAT WERE

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:14.197
DISCUSSED WERE SOME OF THE

01:02:14.263 --> 01:02:15.264
OPTIONS AN EMPLOYER CON

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:16.599
CONTRIBUTED FUND WHICH FOR

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:18.868
STATES TO TAXABLE WAGE FUND

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:21.537
INCREASED THE UPPER LEVELS BUT

01:02:21.604 --> 01:02:23.439
IS POINTED OUT THERE AREN'T

01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:25.074
THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING

01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:29.178
A THAT OF- INCOME THAT. WOULD

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:32.148
CONTRIBUTE AND THEN. AGAIN THE

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:32.882
INCREASING CONTRIBUTION RATE

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:34.550
WHICH IS FOR AGGRESSIVE AND I

01:02:34.617 --> 01:02:35.585
THINK THAT WOULD REALLY

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:37.320
UNDERMINE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:02:37.386 --> 01:02:38.454
FOR A PARTICULAR LOW AND MIDDLE

01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:40.790
INCOME PEOPLE SO. ARE ANY

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:42.959
INCENTIVES THAT WE COULD DO FOR

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:45.228
EMPLOYERS TO GET THEM ON BOARD.

01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:47.930
IN A WE CAN THERE'S AN EASY WAY

01:02:47.997 --> 01:02:50.666
AND HARD WAY TO DO THIS AND TO-

01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:53.336
OBVIOUSLY EMPLOYERS ARE NOT.

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:55.505
SEEING OR YOU KNOW NEED TO DO

01:02:55.571 --> 01:02:57.507
MORE AND DO BETER TO SEE THE

01:02:57.573 --> 01:02:59.275
BENEFITS MAYBE WE NEED TO DO

01:02:59.342 --> 01:03:00.877
BETTER TO. SHOW THEM WHAT THOSE

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:05.047
BENEFITS ARE- BUT BUT ARE THERE

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:05.681
ANY SOLUTION SO YOU CAN SEE AND

01:03:05.748 --> 01:03:10.553
CAN SUGGEST. SO I THINK.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.054
THINKING ABOUT WHAT FIRMS ARE

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:13.956
DOING OR WHAT FIRMS ARE NOT

01:03:14.023 --> 01:03:16.225
DOING IN ENCOURAGING LEAVE

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:18.161
TAKING AND WHAT BENEFITS

01:03:18.227 --> 01:03:19.762
THEY'RE INDEPENDENTLY PROVIDING

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:21.898
IS REALLY IMPORTANT I HAVE TO

01:03:21.964 --> 01:03:23.833
SAY FROM A RESEARCH STANDPOINT

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.768
WE JUST DON'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:27.770
ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY IT IS THAT

01:03:27.837 --> 01:03:30.072
THESE GOOD FIRMS ARE DOING OR

01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:31.507
THESE HIGH TAKE UP FIRMS ARE

01:03:31.574 --> 01:03:33.176
DOING. BUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S

01:03:33.242 --> 01:03:35.845
GOING ON IS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:38.080
WHEN THINKING ABOUT NOT ONLY

01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:40.550
CAN WE FIND WAYS TO MAKE THESE

01:03:40.616 --> 01:03:42.018
THESE PROGRAMS MORE SUSTAINABLE

01:03:42.084 --> 01:03:45.555
IN TERMS OF COST BUT ALSO IN

01:03:45.621 --> 01:03:47.757
TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT- ACT SO

01:03:47.823 --> 01:03:49.325
EVEN IF WE HAVE JOB PROTECTION

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:52.061
EAT IF WE HAVE A REPLACEMENT

01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:52.595
RATE. IF EMPLOYER MAKES IT

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:57.266
DIFFICULT. TO TAKE EITHER

01:03:57.333 --> 01:03:58.501
THROUGH- YOU'RE GOING TO GET A

01:03:58.568 --> 01:03:59.368
SIGNED A BAD SCHEDULE OR YOU'RE

01:03:59.435 --> 01:04:00.069
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET

01:04:00.136 --> 01:04:02.104
PROMOTED OR- YOU KNOW

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:03.539
TECHNICALLY I CAN'T FIRE YOU

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:04.307
BUT I'M GONNA MAKE IT REALLY

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:05.608
UNPLEASANT FOR YOU TO COME BACK

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.210
TO WORK. IF THESE SORTS OF

01:04:07.276 --> 01:04:09.111
THINGS ARE OF CONCERN TO

01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:10.980
WORKERS WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:13.616
IT TAKE UP RATES THAT- ARE

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:15.351
COMPATIBLE TO WHAT WE WOULD

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:17.687
EXPECT. FROM OTHER- OTHER

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:19.355
COUNTRIES AND OTHER STATES AND

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:20.590
SO I THINK WE NEED TO THINK

01:04:20.656 --> 01:04:22.792
VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT WHAT WE

01:04:22.858 --> 01:04:24.026
CAN LEARN FROM EMPLOYERS THAT

01:04:24.093 --> 01:04:26.028
WE KNOW ARE DOING A GOOD JOB ON

01:04:26.095 --> 01:04:27.663
WORK FAMILY BALANCE NOW WE SEE

01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:29.131
A LOT OF LARGE EMPLOYERS. THAT

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:32.201
ARE REALLY USING THAT EXISTENCE

01:04:32.268 --> 01:04:34.103
A VERY GENEROUS PAID PARENTAL

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:36.839
LEAVE PROGRAMS- AND OTHER PAID

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:38.474
LEAVE FAMILY FRIENDLY PROGRAMS

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.209
AS A WAY TO RECRUIT HIGH

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:42.111
QUALITY HIGH SKILLED WORKERS.

01:04:42.178 --> 01:04:44.513
AND ALSO AS A WAY TO CREATE A

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:46.249
POSITIVE IMAGE WITH THE PUBLIC

01:04:46.315 --> 01:04:49.385
IN GENERAL AS PUBLIC SUPPORT

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:53.856
FOR THESE PROGRAMS RISES. BUT

01:04:53.923 --> 01:04:54.490
THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY RESEARCH

01:04:54.557 --> 01:04:55.124
ON THAT BUT WE'RE JUST KIND OF

01:04:55.191 --> 01:04:55.758
STARTING TO TRY AND THINK ABOUT

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:57.193
HOW WE IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:59.161
ASPECTS ABOUT WHAT FIRMS ARE

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:00.263
DOING I THINK THAT WOULD BE

01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:02.298
VERY HELPFUL. AGAIN AGAIN AS

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:04.233
YOU SAY IF COMPANIES DON'T WANT

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:05.334
TO PARTICIPATE THEY'LL MAKE

01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:06.502
LIKE DIFFICULT FOR EMPLOYEES

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:08.471
AND THE- BLESSING OF SOMEONE

01:05:08.537 --> 01:05:09.472
WANTS TO DO WHEN THEY'RE COMING

01:05:09.538 --> 01:05:11.641
BACK FROM A- PERIOD OF LEAVE IS

01:05:11.707 --> 01:05:13.109
TO BE GIVEN A PINK SLIP THE DAY

01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:14.677
THEY COME BACK AND IT'S A FEAR

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:17.046
THAT. WE KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:20.516
HAVE AND- RIGHTLY SO- SO. I

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:22.451
WOULD HOPE THAT THIS MIGHT BE

01:05:22.518 --> 01:05:23.052
SOMETHING WE COULD LOOK AT IT

01:05:23.119 --> 01:05:26.455
DOES. IT'S A WIN WIN- BUT IT WE

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:28.090
NEED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT SOME

01:05:28.157 --> 01:05:29.592
HOUSE SO THAT IT ISN'T JUST AN

01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:32.662
ANECDOTAL AS I MENTIONED MY- MY

01:05:32.728 --> 01:05:34.397
FRIENDS OVER PATAGONIA THEIR

01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:35.398
OTHER COMPANIES I'M SURE TO DO

01:05:35.464 --> 01:05:38.668
THIS. BUT THE YOU KNOW LEADING

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:41.203
BY EXAMPLE IN IN DEMONSTRATING

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:43.406
THAT THIS IS POSSIBLE I THINK

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:45.574
WOULD BE. OF CRITICAL VALUE TO

01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:47.209
US. HE WON'T HAVE A LAST WORD

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:49.111
DIRECOR HEADING BUT NO OF. THE

01:05:49.178 --> 01:05:50.713
BUT I WILL. IF YOU TAKE THE

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.515
LAST WORD. SENATOR I WOULD SET

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:53.349
TELL YOU THAT- WASHINGTON

01:05:53.416 --> 01:05:55.017
STATE. HAS CREATED A PROGRAM IN

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:55.751
THE SENATE PROGRAM FOR

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:58.321
BUSINESSES AS WELL AS- A NEW

01:05:58.387 --> 01:06:06.395
YORK STATE. THERE A PRIVATE.

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:07.430
PRIVATE SYSTEM DIFFERENT THAN

01:06:07.496 --> 01:06:08.798
OUR PUBLIC SYSTEM- FOR PAID

01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:09.665
LEAVE SO IT'S SO IT'S DIFFERENT

01:06:09.732 --> 01:06:11.567
THERE- AND I KNOW THAT- THE

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:12.301
GOVERNOR'S COMMITTEE HAS

01:06:12.368 --> 01:06:13.936
DEFINITELY TAKEN A LOOK AT A-

01:06:14.003 --> 01:06:15.738
TIME- UNEMPLOYMENT RATES- TO

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:16.839
THIS AND LOOKING AT AND-

01:06:16.906 --> 01:06:19.508
POSSIBLE BENEFIT- TO EMPLOYERS

01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:21.177
USING THAT TYPE OF THE SYSTEM

01:06:21.243 --> 01:06:23.612
BUT- NOTHING CONCRETE PROSTATE

01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:25.481
AS OF YET BUT THERE ARE SOME.

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:27.083
EXCITING PROGRAMS I THINK TO

01:06:27.149 --> 01:06:28.084
YOUR POINT TO TRY TO

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:30.686

A TO COME ALONG. THANK YOU AND

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:34.390
I HOPE. JUST TO RESPOND THE

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:36.959
THAT WE KNOW LAW THAT WE THAT

01:06:37.026 --> 01:06:37.693
WE HAVE SOME KIND OF A UNIFORM

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.229
SYSTEM HERE SO THAT. PEOPLE

01:06:40.296 --> 01:06:41.764
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:42.865
EMPLOYERS KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

01:06:42.932 --> 01:06:45.801
REQUIRED TO DO. SO THAT WILL I

01:06:45.868 --> 01:06:47.570
THINK THAT ALSO WILL HELP

01:06:47.636 --> 01:06:48.938
PEOPLE ACCESS THE PROGRAM WHEN

01:06:49.004 --> 01:06:52.441

01:24:09.644 --> 01:24:10.812
SESSION THE SIX WEEKS. WERE TO

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:12.180
BE FUNDED BY THE EMPLOYER WERE

01:24:12.247 --> 01:24:13.882
TAKEN OUT. AND SO WHAT WE WERE

01:24:13.948 --> 01:24:16.484
LEFT WITH WAS ESSENTIALLY HALF

01:24:16.551 --> 01:24:16.985
OF THE PROGRAM THAT WAS

01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:19.220
ENVISIONED. AND THAT'S- WHERE

01:24:19.287 --> 01:24:20.789
THINGS STOOD FOR QUITE AWHILE.

01:24:20.855 --> 01:24:22.190
AS A RESULT THE MISSION BY THE

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:24.526
FIRST PANEL. REALLY AREN'T

01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:26.227
SOMETHING OF AN OUTLIER WITH

01:24:26.294 --> 01:24:32.300
RESPECT TO OTHERS. EIGHT OF THE

01:24:32.367 --> 01:24:39.307
NINE THAT OFFICE PROGRAM. OTHER

01:24:39.374 --> 01:24:39.941
WEAPONS OUT WORKERS TO FUND THE

01:24:40.008 --> 01:24:41.409
ENTIRE PROGRAM. AND I BELIEVE

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:42.110
THAT'S US RHODE ISLAND CONNECT

01:24:42.177 --> 01:24:42.977
FOR THE ONLY ONES. IS OUT OF

01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:43.778
THE OTHER STATES EITHER SPLIT

01:24:43.845 --> 01:24:44.679
THE RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN.

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:45.680
EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES OR THEY

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:46.214
ASK EMPLOYERS TO FUND THE

01:24:46.281 --> 01:24:47.315
ENTIRE PROGRAM. OTHER COUNTRIES

01:24:47.382 --> 01:24:49.150
ALSO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR WHERE

01:24:49.217 --> 01:24:51.119
THE VAST MAJORITYASK EMPLOYERS

01:24:51.186 --> 01:24:52.821
THE FUN PART OF THE PROGRAM.

01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:54.088
THE MOST COMMON WAY IS ACTUALLY

01:24:54.155 --> 01:24:55.190
THROUGH THE SOCIAL SECURITY

01:24:55.256 --> 01:24:57.592
PROGRAM OF THAT COUNTRY. AND SO

01:24:57.659 --> 01:24:59.394
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL IT'S

01:24:59.461 --> 01:25:00.728
USUALLY KIND OF LIKE IT IS HERE

01:25:00.795 --> 01:25:01.830
WHERE IT'S HOW FROM THE BY THE

01:25:01.896 --> 01:25:03.331
WORKER HOW FUNDED BY THE

01:25:03.398 --> 01:25:06.267
EMPLOYER. AND ARE ALSO

01:25:06.334 --> 01:25:10.271
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES- BOTH

01:25:10.338 --> 01:25:13.775
PARTIES. HAVE PUT FORTH PAID

01:25:13.842 --> 01:25:14.309
FAMILY PROGRAMS THAT WERE

01:25:14.375 --> 01:25:17.946
FUNDED BY BOTH. SUPPORT PLANS

01:25:18.012 --> 01:25:18.413
THAT EITHER SHARE THE

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:19.280
RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN BOTH

01:25:19.347 --> 01:25:21.082
WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS OR PUT

01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:22.550
ALL OF THE RESPONSIBILITY ON

01:25:22.617 --> 01:25:25.153
EMPLOYERS. AND ARE NONE OTHER

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:26.688
THAN DONALD TRUMP PROPOSE ONE

01:25:26.754 --> 01:25:27.789
THAT IS FUNDED ALL BY

01:25:27.856 --> 01:25:29.557
EMPLOYERS- THERE WERE SOME

01:25:29.624 --> 01:25:30.592
OTHER ISSUES WITH THE ONES

01:25:30.658 --> 01:25:31.593
PROPOSED BY THAT PARTY BUT WE

01:25:31.659 --> 01:25:32.660
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION

01:25:32.727 --> 01:25:34.696
THAT. IT DOES SEEM LIKE THE

01:25:34.762 --> 01:25:36.531
NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE HERE IS OF

01:25:36.598 --> 01:25:38.833
ONE THAT SHOULD AT A MINIMUM BE

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:39.567
A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN

01:25:39.634 --> 01:25:42.971
WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS- AND SO

01:25:43.037 --> 01:25:44.873
WE THINK THAT THAT IS THERE FOR

01:25:44.939 --> 01:25:46.474
A REASON THAT AS WAS ALSO

01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:47.876
MENTIONED THIS IS A PROGRAM

01:25:47.942 --> 01:25:49.143
THAT VERY MUCH BENEFITS BOTH

01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:50.578
WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS THAT.

01:25:50.645 --> 01:25:53.681
THERE ARE CLEAR QUANTIFIABLE

01:25:53.748 --> 01:25:55.316
SAVINGS IN TERMS OF REDUCING

01:25:55.383 --> 01:25:56.484
THE COST OF EMPLOYER PROVIDED

01:25:56.551 --> 01:25:58.820
BENEFITS THAT. PRIOR TO PAID

01:25:58.887 --> 01:26:00.522
FAMILY LEAVE EMPLOYERS IF THEY

01:26:00.588 --> 01:26:02.557
DID OFFER THE PAY FOR THE WHOLE

01:26:02.624 --> 01:26:04.058
THING. AND WE CREATED THE

01:26:04.125 --> 01:26:06.160
PROGRAM THEY ONLY HAD TO PAY

01:26:06.227 --> 01:26:08.329
4405% OF IT THE FIRST THIS WEEK

01:26:08.396 --> 01:26:10.131
AND- AS WE EXPANDED. ACOSTA

01:26:10.198 --> 01:26:11.099
LAWYER DOWN THE COST TO THE

01:26:11.165 --> 01:26:11.966
WORKER GOES UP AS LONG AS WE

01:26:12.033 --> 01:26:13.101
KEEP THE EXIST FINANCING

01:26:13.167 --> 01:26:15.336
STRUCTURE. THEY'RE ALSO SAVINGS

01:26:15.403 --> 01:26:16.771
INVOLVED IN NOT HAVING TO

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:19.707
RECRUIT AND TRAIN NEW WORKERS.

01:26:19.774 --> 01:26:22.510
BECAUSE THIS ALLOWS WORKERS TO

01:26:22.577 --> 01:26:24.012
GO BACK TO THE JOB HEY DON'T

01:26:24.078 --> 01:26:26.180
HAVE TO QUIT AND GO FIND A NEW

01:26:26.247 --> 01:26:28.216
ONE. AND THEY'RE ALSO

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:37.992
PRODUCTIVITY. S. ON MOTHER

01:26:38.059 --> 01:26:39.460
REALLY TWO PIECES TO THAT ONE

01:26:39.527 --> 01:26:41.329
WAS WHAT WILL LIKELY AT SOME

01:26:41.396 --> 01:26:42.564
POINT B. A TAX INCREASE FOR

01:26:42.630 --> 01:26:44.666
WORKERS. AND THEN ALSO A

01:26:44.732 --> 01:26:45.366
REDUCTION IN THE SOLVENCY

01:26:45.433 --> 01:26:48.169
REQUIREMENTS- WE THINK WERE

01:26:48.236 --> 01:26:49.704
ARGUABLY UNFAIR FOR A FEW

01:26:49.771 --> 01:26:51.739
REASONS. THE FIRST OF WHICH IS

01:26:51.806 --> 01:26:53.741
THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN.

01:26:53.808 --> 01:26:55.410
THE STI FUND AND THE WORKERS

01:26:55.476 --> 01:26:57.245
COMPENSATION SYSTEM THAT WE

01:26:57.312 --> 01:26:58.046
DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH

01:26:58.112 --> 01:26:59.714
ATTENTION AND THAT'S THAT. WHEN

01:26:59.781 --> 01:27:01.282
A WORKER SUFFERS AN ON THE JOB

01:27:01.349 --> 01:27:03.351
INJURY THE EMPLOYER FIGHTS THE

01:27:03.418 --> 01:27:04.586
CLAIM THEY SAY WE DON'T THINK

01:27:04.652 --> 01:27:06.387
THAT HAPPENED HERE AT WORK. THE

01:27:06.454 --> 01:27:07.755
WORKER USUALLY HAS TO GO OUT ON

01:27:07.822 --> 01:27:09.791
DISABILITY INSURANCE THEY TELL

01:27:09.857 --> 01:27:11.025
ET DE THAT THIS IS WHAT'S

01:27:11.092 --> 01:27:12.927
HAPPENING. AND THEN AT THE END

01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:13.728
OF THE APPEALS BOARD FINDS THAT

01:27:13.795 --> 01:27:15.897
IT WAS A COMPENSABLE INJURY.

01:27:15.964 --> 01:27:17.131
EDS SUPPOSED TO GO BACK TO THE

01:27:17.198 --> 01:27:19.233
EMPLOYER GET THEIR MONEY BACK.

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:20.835
WE'RE TOLD THAT PRETTY RARELY

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:22.604
HAPPENS AND THAT WHEN IT DOES

01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:24.939
HAPPEN IT'S SETTLED FOR MUCH

01:27:25.006 --> 01:27:26.874
LOWER AMOUNT SO. THERE'S A

01:27:26.941 --> 01:27:27.742
WHOLE LOT OF MONEY THAT SHE IN

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:29.978
THE I FROM THAT'S NOT THERE.

01:27:30.044 --> 01:27:31.079
THE BEST ESTIMATE THAT WE'VE

01:27:31.145 --> 01:27:32.280
GOT IS THAT THERE'S ABOUT ONE

01:27:32.347 --> 01:27:33.648
POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT

01:27:33.715 --> 01:27:34.916
SHOULD BE ON THE FIVE THAT'S

01:27:34.983 --> 01:27:36.551
NOT BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE-

01:27:36.618 --> 01:27:40.922
THERE ARE ALSO A CERTAIN THAT

01:27:40.989 --> 01:27:43.524
THE FUNDAMENTAL INSOLVENCY THE

01:27:43.591 --> 01:27:45.293
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.862
IS CONNECTED TO THIS. THAT TIME

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.964
THE WIFE WHEN INSOLVENT LAST

01:27:50.031 --> 01:27:51.366
RECESSION. THEY BORROWED

01:27:51.432 --> 01:27:52.333
THROUGH THE TEN DOLLARS IT WAS

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:56.604
CLOSE TO DOLLARS. OUT OF THE D.

01:27:56.671 --> 01:27:57.238
I. FUNDED COVER THE INTEREST ON

01:27:57.305 --> 01:28:01.442
THOSE. WAS VERY PREDICTABLE

01:28:01.509 --> 01:28:02.010
WIND THAT THAT MIGHT HAPPEN

01:28:02.076 --> 01:28:02.744
EVERY AND THAT THERE'S A

01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:03.878
RECESSION WE DON'T. ADEQUATELY

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:04.612
FUND THE U. I. SYSTEM. WE DON'T

01:28:04.679 --> 01:28:05.413
REALLY HAVE A VERY GOOD PLAN

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:05.980
FOR WHAT TO DO TO COVER THAT

01:28:06.047 --> 01:28:07.015
INTEREST AND SO THE ONLY OPTION

01:28:07.081 --> 01:28:07.915
WE ARE LEFT WITH LAST TIME WAS

01:28:07.982 --> 01:28:08.850
TO. BASICALLY ASK WORKERS TO

01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:09.884
BAIL OUT EMPLOYERS BECAUSE WE

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:12.253
JUST COLLECTIVELY. SEEM TO NOT

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.087
BE WILLING TO ADEQUATELY FUND

01:28:13.154 --> 01:28:16.024
THE U. I. SYSTEM. AND SO THAT'S-AN ISSUE THERE'S ALSO THE

01:28:16.090 --> 01:28:17.792
CONCERN THAT. AS THE FIRST

01:28:17.859 --> 01:28:19.260
PANEL MENTIONED THAT WORKER

01:28:19.327 --> 01:28:20.528
WHICH IS REALLY HAVEN'T GOT.

01:28:20.595 --> 01:28:22.096
MUCH IF AT ALL IN THE LAST

01:28:22.163 --> 01:28:25.033
FORTY YEARS AND- IF WE DO THINK

01:28:25.099 --> 01:28:26.501
THAT THIS PROGRAM IS WORTH

01:28:26.567 --> 01:28:28.970
EXPANDING. WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT

01:28:29.037 --> 01:28:29.537
WHETHER OR NOT THOSE WORKERS

01:28:29.604 --> 01:28:30.905
ARE REALLY IN A PLACE TO

01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:33.474
ABSORB. HIGHER TAXES HIGHER

01:28:33.541 --> 01:28:35.043
IMPACTS ON. THE PHONE WHAT WE

01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:37.045
LIKE TO DO AND ALSO JUST

01:28:37.111 --> 01:28:38.246
BRIEFLY TOUCH ON THE ADEQUACY

01:28:38.312 --> 01:28:40.515
RATE. SO WE PAID FOR WILL WE

01:28:40.581 --> 01:28:41.382
TRY TO PAY FOR MOST OF WHAT WE

01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:43.451
DID THIS YEAR BY REDUCING THAT

01:28:43.518 --> 01:28:45.987
ADEQUACY RATE FROM ONE POINT

01:28:46.054 --> 01:28:47.422
FOUR FIVE TO ONE POINT SPREE.

01:28:47.488 --> 01:28:48.556
MEETING THAT WE SET THE WORKER

01:28:48.623 --> 01:28:51.893
TAX RATE AT. WHAT DO WE PAY OUT

01:28:51.959 --> 01:28:54.062
WE MULTIPLY THAT BY THAT ACT

01:28:54.128 --> 01:28:55.430
WAS HERE. AND THAT'S WHERE WE

01:28:55.496 --> 01:28:56.330
SET THE RIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:28:56.397 --> 01:28:58.533
THAT'S WHAT CAME IN. AND AT ONE

01:28:58.599 --> 01:29:01.736
POINT FOUR FIVE EQUITY FACTOR.

01:29:01.803 --> 01:29:02.370
WAS JUST PULL THE SCOTT WE CAN

01:29:02.437 --> 01:29:04.405
HAVE A PRETTY PAINFUL PROCESS

01:29:04.472 --> 01:29:06.207
OF TRIAL AND ERROR IN THE PAST

01:29:06.274 --> 01:29:07.575
WHERE. THERE WERE THREE YEARS

01:29:07.642 --> 01:29:09.177
THE FUND WENT SOFT AND SO TO

01:29:09.243 --> 01:29:11.012
AVOID THAT WHAT WE HAD TO DO

01:29:11.079 --> 01:29:17.085
WAS. BASICALLY RIGHT TO WEAR IT

01:29:17.151 --> 01:29:17.685
NOW NOT WHERE IT'S BEEN IT'S-

01:29:17.752 --> 01:29:20.655
BEEN. HE HASN'T BEEN A PROBLEM.

01:29:20.722 --> 01:29:22.123
BUT WE'RE PRETTY CONCERNED

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:23.124
ABOUT THIS ONE POINT 3%

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:23.991
ADEQUACY RATE- MY ARM. THERE

01:29:24.058 --> 01:29:25.393
ARE TWENTY SIX YEARS SINCE

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:26.227
NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN. THAT THE

01:29:26.294 --> 01:29:27.361
ADVISORY HAS DIPPED BELOW THAT.

01:29:27.428 --> 01:29:28.062
SO WERE THAT TO HAPPEN NOW.

01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:28.863
THERE REALLY KNOW WHAT WOULD

01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:30.398
HAPPEN WE WOULD PROBABLY REDUCE

01:29:30.465 --> 01:29:31.632
BENEFITS WHICH IS WHAT WE DID

01:29:31.699 --> 01:29:34.235
LAST TIME. AND THAT'S MORE THAN

01:29:34.302 --> 01:29:35.103
A THIRD OF THE TIME IT'S GONE

01:29:35.169 --> 01:29:37.472
BELOW THAT AND SO. HOPEFULLY

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:38.906
HISTORY WILL BE A GUIDE HERE

01:29:38.973 --> 01:29:40.041
BUT WE WON'T REALLY KNOW WAS

01:29:40.108 --> 01:29:42.477
HAVE TO SEE HOW IT HAPPENS- AND

01:29:42.543 --> 01:29:43.978
IN THE LAST WEEK WE WANTED TO.

01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:46.080
IT WAS JUST THAT. AS FAR AS

01:29:46.147 --> 01:29:48.516
EXPANDING PAID FAMILY BENEFITS

01:29:48.583 --> 01:29:49.383
AGAIN SOMETHING THAT WE VERY

01:29:49.450 --> 01:29:50.384
MUCH SUPPORT BOTH IN TERMS OF

01:29:50.451 --> 01:29:53.621
DURATION WAGER PLACEMENT BUT-

01:29:53.688 --> 01:29:55.890
THE FACT OF. ITS OWN. IN A

01:29:55.957 --> 01:29:57.225
WOVEN INTO THE ES DE I SYSTEM

01:29:57.291 --> 01:29:57.825
IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE AND

01:29:57.892 --> 01:29:59.160
THAT WERE WE TO SAY. RAISE THE

01:29:59.227 --> 01:30:01.129
WAITER PLACEMENT RATE FOR PAID

01:30:01.195 --> 01:30:02.396
FAMILY WITHOUT DOING THE SAME

01:30:02.463 --> 01:30:04.432
DISABILITY INSURANCE. LIKE IT

01:30:04.499 --> 01:30:05.266
OR NOT WE'RE SENDING A MESSAGE

01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:07.135
TO WORKERS THAT THE STATE.

01:30:07.201 --> 01:30:08.469
PRIORITIZE AS ONE OVER THE

01:30:08.536 --> 01:30:10.938
OTHER AND SO. NOT ALL OF OUR

01:30:11.005 --> 01:30:11.606
AFFILIATES NOT ALL OF OUR

01:30:11.672 --> 01:30:13.241
MEMBERS WOULD AGREE WITH THAT

01:30:13.307 --> 01:30:14.809
THAT. THERE ARE SOME WHO THINK

01:30:14.876 --> 01:30:16.978
THAT. YOU KNOW TAKING TIME OFF

01:30:17.044 --> 01:30:18.479
TO CARE FOR THEIR OWN SERIOUS

01:30:18.546 --> 01:30:19.547
HEALTH CONCERN IS EVERY BIT AS

01:30:19.614 --> 01:30:22.517
IMPORTANT AS BABY BONDING OR-

01:30:22.583 --> 01:30:23.351
TAKING TIME OFF TO CARE FOR A

01:30:23.417 --> 01:30:25.319
SICK RELATIVE A SICK PARENT

01:30:25.386 --> 01:30:29.123
SICK CHILD. IS JUST AS

01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:29.724
IMPORTANT AS BABY BONDING BUT

01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:32.160
THAT. IF WE DO. I'M OUT AND SAY

01:30:32.226 --> 01:30:32.760
THAT ONE SHOULD BE REIMBURSED

01:30:32.827 --> 01:30:33.294
AT A HIGHER RATE THAN THE

01:30:33.361 --> 01:30:34.929
OTHER. IT'S LIKELY GOING TO

01:30:34.996 --> 01:30:36.430
CREATE A LOT OF FILL A LOT OF

01:30:36.497 --> 01:30:38.599
CONCERN AMONG OUR MEMBERS THAT.

01:30:38.666 --> 01:30:39.367
MAY NOT BE THE INTENT BUT WOULD

01:30:39.433 --> 01:30:41.202
LIKELY BE THE OUTCOME AND SO.

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:43.938
THOSE ARE JUST SOME ISSUES AND-

01:30:44.005 --> 01:30:44.539
WE DO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE

01:30:44.605 --> 01:30:45.673
OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY.

TO BE HERE TODAY I'M GONNA BE

01:31:08.329 --> 01:31:09.497
TALKING ABOUT IN A VISIBLE

01:31:09.564 --> 01:31:11.365
POPULATION WITH IN OUR WORK

01:31:11.432 --> 01:31:14.168
POPULATION- WHICH ARE FAMILY

01:31:14.235 --> 01:31:18.039
CARE GIVERS. OVER THE YEARS WE

01:31:18.105 --> 01:31:19.774
CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA IF

01:31:19.841 --> 01:31:21.709
THEY'RE ACTUALLY FOUR POINT

01:31:21.776 --> 01:31:25.246
FOUR MILLION FAMILY CARE GIVERS.

01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:26.914
CURRENTLY A MAJORITY OF THEM

01:31:26.981 --> 01:31:29.917
WORK OVER 50% AND MOST

01:31:29.984 --> 01:31:33.654
IDENTIFIES FEMALE. CURRENTLY

01:31:33.721 --> 01:31:35.556
THERE ARE ABOUT SEVEN POTENTIAL

01:31:35.623 --> 01:31:37.325
CARE GIVERS FOR EVERY PERSON

01:31:37.391 --> 01:31:39.827
OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTY AND

01:31:39.894 --> 01:31:41.429
CURRENTLY CARE GIVERS PROVIDE

01:31:41.495 --> 01:31:44.465
MORE INTENSIVE AND COMPLEX CARE

01:31:44.532 --> 01:31:45.733
THEN AT ANY OTHER TIME IN

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:47.902
HISTORY AS MEDICAL NURSING

01:31:47.969 --> 01:31:50.004
TASKS AND MULTIPLE HEALTH

01:31:50.071 --> 01:31:52.073
CONDITIONS HAVE INCREASED. OVER

01:31:52.139 --> 01:31:56.277
TIME. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE

01:31:56.344 --> 01:31:58.045
CURRENTLY BUT WHAT IS NOW

01:31:58.112 --> 01:32:00.681
DOESN'T REFLECT THE FUTURE. A

01:32:00.748 --> 01:32:02.783
MERE TEN YEARS THE CARE GIVER

01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:04.752
SUPPORT RATIO IS EXPECTED TO

01:32:04.819 --> 01:32:07.288
PLUMMET AS BOOMERS TRANSITION

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:08.990
FROM YOUNG CARE GIVERS INTO

01:32:09.056 --> 01:32:11.726
PEOPLE WHO NEED CARE. BY TWENTY

01:32:11.792 --> 01:32:15.096
THIRTY THE SUPPORT RATIO WILL

01:32:15.162 --> 01:32:17.231
BE ABOUT FOUR CARE GIVERS TO

01:32:17.298 --> 01:32:20.201
EVERY PERSON OVER THE AGE OF

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:23.337
EIGHTY YEARS OLD AND BY TWENTY

01:32:23.404 --> 01:32:24.205
FIFTY IT IS GOING TO BE BELOW

01:32:24.272 --> 01:32:29.744
THREE TO ONE. RIGHT NOW THE

01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:32.179
CHALLENGES OF CARE GIVERS FACE

01:32:32.246 --> 01:32:35.016
WILL REALLY BE RISING AS THE

01:32:35.082 --> 01:32:36.317
POPULATION OF PERSONS WITH

01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:39.287
DEMENTIA CHRONIC PAIN MULTIPLE

01:32:39.353 --> 01:32:41.222
MEDICAL PROBLEMS CONTINUE TO

01:32:41.289 --> 01:32:45.760
SWELL IN OUR STATE. IN TWENTY

01:32:45.826 --> 01:32:46.994
EIGHTEEN AND A SURVEY FUNDED BY

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:49.597
A. R. P. OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:52.433
THEY FOUND IT A FULL 41% OF

01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:55.036
THOSE SURVEYED ARE OR HAVE BEEN

01:32:55.102 --> 01:32:57.438
UNPAID FAMILY CARE GIVERS.

01:32:57.505 --> 01:33:00.374
CURRENTLY 74% OF THOSE CARE

01:33:00.441 --> 01:33:03.177
GIVERS REPORT FEELING STRESSED

01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:03.778
BY WORKING AND PROVIDING CARE

01:33:03.844 --> 01:33:07.114
AT THE SAME TIME. ANOTHER 71%

01:33:07.181 --> 01:33:08.916
REPORTED HAVING TO CHANGE THEIR

01:33:08.983 --> 01:33:10.885
WORK SCHEDULE TO ACCOMMODATE

01:33:10.952 --> 01:33:13.087
CAREGIVING RESPONSIBILITIES.

01:33:13.154 --> 01:33:14.722
BUT AGAIN WHAT CURRENT DOESN'T

01:33:14.789 --> 01:33:18.059
REFLECT THE FUTURE. IN TWENTY

01:33:18.125 --> 01:33:21.162
YEARS IT IS PROJECTED THAT 51%

01:33:21.228 --> 01:33:24.899
OF WORKERS WILL BE- EXPERIENCE

01:33:24.966 --> 01:33:26.467
HAVING SOME EXPERIENCE WITH

01:33:26.534 --> 01:33:28.235
FAMILY CARE GIVING SO WE'RE

01:33:28.302 --> 01:33:32.606
GOING FROM A 44% OF WORKERS

01:33:32.673 --> 01:33:34.875
251% AND A MAJORITY OF THEM

01:33:34.942 --> 01:33:37.345
WILL STILL BE IN THE WORK

01:33:37.411 --> 01:33:40.047
FORCE. AS OLDER CARE GIVERS.

01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:42.216
LOOKING AT DEMOGRAPHICS

01:33:42.283 --> 01:33:43.718
CURRENTLY THE MAJORITY OF CARE

01:33:43.784 --> 01:33:46.520
GIVERS ARE WHITE BUT BY TWENTY

01:33:46.587 --> 01:33:48.589
FIFTY THIS PROFILE WILL CHANGE

01:33:48.656 --> 01:33:50.624
AND THE PROPORTION OF RACIAL

01:33:50.691 --> 01:33:51.258
AND ETHNIC CARE GIVERS WILL BE

01:33:51.325 --> 01:33:53.694
CLOSER TO THE MAJORITY. AND

01:33:53.761 --> 01:33:55.896
ALSO A MAJORITY OF THOSE CARE

01:33:55.963 --> 01:33:58.632
GIVERS WILL BE OVER THE AGE OF

01:33:58.699 --> 01:34:00.634
SEVENTY YEARS OLD THEMSELVES.

01:34:00.701 --> 01:34:06.007
THIS MONTH. I ACTUALLY DID IF

01:34:06.073 --> 01:34:06.707
YOU LOOK AT THE LITTLE HEART

01:34:06.774 --> 01:34:08.609
THERE I DID A QUICK REVIEW OF

01:34:08.676 --> 01:34:10.644
NEWSPAPER ARTICLES IN THE PAST

01:34:10.711 --> 01:34:13.314
YEAR WHICH FEATURED CARE GIVING.

01:34:13.381 --> 01:34:14.982
THE DOODLE REPRESENTS KEY WORDS

01:34:15.049 --> 01:34:16.817
THAT WERE USED IN THE ARTICLE

01:34:16.884 --> 01:34:18.953
HEADLIGHTS THE MORE OFTEN THE

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:20.554
WORD IS USED THE LARGER THE

01:34:20.621 --> 01:34:22.556
FOUGHT. NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:34:22.623 --> 01:34:23.891
ARTICLES CURRENTLY THERE'S A

01:34:23.958 --> 01:34:26.727
RISING TIDE OF AWARENESS AMONG

01:34:26.794 --> 01:34:28.295
OUR BLOOMERS AND ARE

01:34:28.362 --> 01:34:30.197
MILLENNIALS. AND ARE THEY ARE

01:34:30.264 --> 01:34:32.500
REALLY BMP IMPACTED BY CARE

01:34:32.566 --> 01:34:33.534
GIVING BUT THEY'R ALSO

01:34:33.601 --> 01:34:36.103
CONCERNED ABOUT WORK AND STRESS

01:34:36.170 --> 01:34:38.572
AT THE SAME TIME. ANOTHER

01:34:38.639 --> 01:34:40.207
REVIEW OF EMPIRICAL STUDIES

01:34:40.274 --> 01:34:42.176
ALSO SUGGEST THE CARE GIVERS

01:34:42.243 --> 01:34:44.412
REPORT POOR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL

01:34:44.478 --> 01:34:47.048
HEALTH THE NON CARE GIVERS.

01:34:47.114 --> 01:34:48.816
THEY ALSO RECEIVE THE CARE

01:34:48.883 --> 01:34:51.652
RECEIVER HOWEVER WHO DOES HAVE

01:34:51.719 --> 01:34:53.621
A CARE GIVER SHOW BETTER HEALTH

01:34:53.687 --> 01:34:55.556
pOUTCOMES AND LOWER RATES OF

01:34:55.623 --> 01:34:58.359
HOSPITAL USAGE AND ARE LESS

01:34:58.426 --> 01:34:58.926
LIKELY TO USE INSTITUTIONAL

01:34:58.993 --> 01:35:02.730
CARE. SO WHAT IS CURRENTLY

01:35:02.797 --> 01:35:03.964
HAPPENING TO CALIFORNIA'S

01:35:04.031 --> 01:35:06.200
CARING FAMILIES WELL RIGHT NOW

01:35:06.267 --> 01:35:07.768
THEY'RE CAUGHT IN A RIP TIDE

01:35:07.835 --> 01:35:09.837
AND REALLY YELLING FOR HELP AND

01:35:09.904 --> 01:35:12.306
THE ONLY LIFE GUARD IS NOT

01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:12.873
PAYING ANY ATTENTION TO THE

01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:15.743
FAMILY CARE GIVER. THE CLAIMS

01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:16.911
PROCESS FOR THE PFL

01:35:16.977 --> 01:35:18.679
INTERMITTENT LEAVE IS SO

01:35:18.746 --> 01:35:21.382
TREACHEROUS THAT MOST CARE

01:35:21.449 --> 01:35:21.949
GIVERS WON'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO

01:35:22.016 --> 01:35:24.151
FILL OUT THE FORMS. THIS MIGHT

01:35:24.218 --> 01:35:26.821
EXPLAIN WHY ONLY 10% OF PFL

01:35:26.887 --> 01:35:29.156
CLAIMS ARE FOR CARE GIVERS BUT

01:35:29.223 --> 01:35:32.059
WE KNOW THAT THEY SPEND

01:35:32.126 --> 01:35:35.062
DEMOGRAPHICS THAT'S FAR TOO LOW.

01:35:35.129 --> 01:35:35.863
CARE GIVERS AND NEED TO TAKE

01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:38.065
TIME OFF TO HELP A SICK PARROT

01:35:38.132 --> 01:35:39.767
OR GRAVELY ILL LEFT ONE ARE

01:35:39.834 --> 01:35:41.569
JUST GIVING UP THEIR CUTTING

01:35:41.635 --> 01:35:43.037
BACK ON HOURS AND THEY'RE

01:35:43.104 --> 01:35:44.538
LEAVING THE WORK FORCE ARE

01:35:44.605 --> 01:35:47.041
WORKING MORE AND FEELING MORE

01:35:47.108 --> 01:35:48.909
STRESS MOREOVER WOMEN AND

01:35:48.976 --> 01:35:51.278
ETHNIC AND RACIAL POPULATIONS

01:35:51.345 --> 01:35:51.846
ARE MORE LIKELY TO FALL INTO

01:35:51.912 --> 01:35:55.216
THIS PATTERN. WOMEN AND PEOPLE

01:35:55.282 --> 01:35:56.884
OF COLOR ARE JEOPARDIZING THEIR

01:35:56.951 --> 01:35:59.320
HEALTH AND FINANCIAL FUTURES SO

01:35:59.386 --> 01:36:01.789
THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE OVER

01:36:01.856 --> 01:36:03.023
FIFTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO

01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:05.559
CALIFORNIA. IN UNPAID LONG TERM

01:36:05.626 --> 01:36:07.661
CARE BUT CALIFORNIA DOESN'T

01:36:07.728 --> 01:36:09.430
HAVE AN ADEQUATE SAFETY NET TO

01:36:09.497 --> 01:36:12.366
CATCH THEM BEFORE THEY DROUGHT.

01:36:12.433 --> 01:36:12.933
AND WHY SHOULD WE CARE WHAT

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.302
HAPPENS TO THESE CARE GIVERS.

01:36:15.369 --> 01:36:17.037
LET'S BE REAL I MEAN ISN'T CARE

01:36:17.104 --> 01:36:20.841
GIVING A PRIVATE FAMILY ISSUE.

01:36:20.908 --> 01:36:22.243
IS WHAT WE DO FOR LOVE. YOU

01:36:22.309 --> 01:36:24.678
KNOW LET THE FAMILIES BE THE

01:36:24.745 --> 01:36:25.279
LIFE PRESERVERS I MEAN HASN'T

01:36:25.346 --> 01:36:28.182
ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY. WELL THE

01:36:28.249 --> 01:36:29.984
FAMILY STRUCTURE REALLY HAS

01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:31.585
CHANGED AND SO HAS THE NATURE

01:36:31.652 --> 01:36:34.088
OF CARE GIVING. THERE NOW AND

01:36:34.155 --> 01:36:35.222
WILL CONTINUE TO BE FEWER

01:36:35.289 --> 01:36:37.158
PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE

01:36:37.224 --> 01:36:39.193
GROWING OLDER POPULATION. MORE

01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:40.928
PEOPLE ARE REQUIRING CHRONIC

01:36:40.995 --> 01:36:43.264
CARE AND CARE NEEDS THAT

01:36:43.330 --> 01:36:44.765
REQUIRE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE

01:36:44.832 --> 01:36:46.033
THAT IN THE PAST WE'RE REALLY

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:47.902
DONE BY NURSES. AND OTHER

01:36:47.968 --> 01:36:49.570
MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:51.272
THEY'RE BEING DONE IN THE HOME

01:36:51.338 --> 01:36:54.308
UNSUPERVISED. MORE OF THE

01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:55.843
TRADITIONAL CARE GIVERS WHO

01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:58.479
WERE WOMEN ARE ALSO WORKING.

01:36:58.546 --> 01:36:59.513
THEIR SINGLE HAVE ADULT

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:01.182
CHILDREN AND THEY REALLY CAUGHT

01:37:01.248 --> 01:37:03.617
IN WHAT WEEK OFTEN HERE AS THE

01:37:03.684 --> 01:37:05.819
SANDWICH GENERATION. AND

01:37:05.886 --> 01:37:06.453
THEY'RE ALSO NEED THE FINANCIAL

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:09.056
SUPPORT. OVERALL THE

01:37:09.123 --> 01:37:10.191
DEMOGRAPHICS AND FAMILY

01:37:10.257 --> 01:37:12.393
STRUCTURE CHANGES IN CALIFORNIA

01:37:12.459 --> 01:37:15.029
STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT IF WE

01:37:15.095 --> 01:37:16.730
DON'T SUPPORT CARE GIVERS TO

01:37:16.797 --> 01:37:18.666
HELP MAINTAIN FAMILY MEMBERS IN

01:37:18.732 --> 01:37:20.100
THEIR HOME. OUR HEALTHCARE

01:37:20.167 --> 01:37:21.802
SYSTEM WILL BE RAPIDLY

01:37:21.869 --> 01:37:23.938
OVERWHELMED WITH THE RISING

01:37:24.004 --> 01:37:27.575
COST OF INSTITUTIONAL CARE. SO

01:37:27.641 --> 01:37:29.343
WHAT DO I RECOMMEND WE CAN

01:37:29.410 --> 01:37:30.811
START RESCUING THESE CARE

01:37:30.878 --> 01:37:32.479
GIVERS AND OUR STATE'S ECONOMY

01:37:32.546 --> 01:37:35.883
TODAY IF WE LOOK AT THE SIX

01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:36.417
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE

01:37:36.483 --> 01:37:38.719
PRESENTED IN A RECENT SURVEY.

01:37:38.786 --> 01:37:40.054
BY BOTH HUMAN IMPACT PARTNERS

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:43.224
AND A. R. P. WE NEED TO PROVIDE

01:37:43.290 --> 01:37:45.059
JOB PROTECTION SO THAT THESE

01:37:45.125 --> 01:37:46.627
CARE GIVERS WHO TEND TO BE

01:37:46.694 --> 01:37:49.029
OLDER ARE NOT FORCED OUT OF THE

01:37:49.096 --> 01:37:50.130
WORKPLACE WITH LITTLE

01:37:50.197 --> 01:37:52.032
OPPORTUNITY OF BEING RE HIRED

01:37:52.099 --> 01:37:54.101
BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE WE NEED TO

01:37:54.168 --> 01:37:55.836
PROVIDE TAX CREDITS SO THAT OUT

01:37:55.903 --> 01:37:58.305
OF POCKET SPENDING IS REDUCED.

01:37:58.372 --> 01:38:00.474
WE NEED TO LOOK AT WAYS TO

01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:04.078
OFFSET LOST RETIREMENT INCOME

01:38:04.144 --> 01:38:04.612
SO THAT THEY DON'T END UP

01:38:04.678 --> 01:38:06.814
HOMELESS ARE IN POVERTY. WE

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:07.848
NEED TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND

THE COUNTRY. EVEN ON WEST WING

01:40:46.306 --> 01:40:47.274
A YEAR BEFORE THEY WERE SAYING

01:40:47.341 --> 01:40:48.542

STATES AND AS WE KNOWN AS IS

01:40:54.314 --> 01:40:55.549
CENTER JACKSON MENTIONED WERE

01:40:55.616 --> 01:40:56.884
QUITE ALONE. IN THE UNITED

01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:58.051
STATES AND BEING ONE OF THE FEW

01:40:58.118 --> 01:41:00.320
COUNTRIES- MORE THAN FIFTY

01:41:00.387 --> 01:41:02.156
COUNTRIES HAVE SIX MONTHS OF

01:41:02.222 --> 01:41:03.590
PAID LEAVE. FOR AT LEAST ONE

01:41:03.657 --> 01:41:05.259
PARENT SO WE'RE WE'RE WAY

01:41:05.325 --> 01:41:07.027
BEHIND THERE BUT SINCE WE

01:41:07.094 --> 01:41:09.396
SPARKS THIS A LOT OF STATES IN

01:41:09.463 --> 01:41:10.898
EIGHT STATES HAVE LEAVE LAWS.

01:41:10.964 --> 01:41:12.900
WE ARE PART OF A NETWORK OF

01:41:12.966 --> 01:41:14.568
TWENTY SEVEN STATE COALITIONS.

01:41:14.635 --> 01:41:16.570
EVEN IN STATES YOU WOULDN'T

01:41:16.637 --> 01:41:17.171
IMAGINE THAT ARE FIGHTING FOR

01:41:17.237 --> 01:41:18.872
PAID SICK DAYS AND PAID LEAVE.

01:41:18.939 --> 01:41:20.674
ALL OF THE THINGS THAT GIVE US

01:41:20.741 --> 01:41:21.842
THE RIGHT TO CARE FOR OURSELVES

01:41:21.909 --> 01:41:23.210
AND CARE. HEATHER AND HAVE

01:41:23.277 --> 01:41:24.711
ECONOMIC SECURITY WHILE DOING

01:41:24.778 --> 01:41:26.313
SO WHICH- REALLY SHOULD BE

01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:27.948
UNIVERSAL AND PART OF WHY I

01:41:28.015 --> 01:41:29.383
THINK WE NEED TO PUSH TOWARD

01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:31.285
THAT UNIVERSAL. GOAL IS THAT

01:41:31.351 --> 01:41:32.920
THAT GETS RID OF THE OTHER

01:41:32.986 --> 01:41:34.288
PROBLEM OF PEOPLE NOT KNOWING

01:41:34.354 --> 01:41:35.989
WHETHER THEY HAVE THE RIGHT. A

01:41:36.056 --> 01:41:37.324
LOT OF COUNTRIES PEOPLE AREN'T

01:41:37.391 --> 01:41:39.827
SITTING HERE WONDERING IF THEY

01:41:39.893 --> 01:41:41.061
QUALIFY FOR THIS OR THAT OR IF

01:41:41.128 --> 01:41:42.563
THEY CAN TAKE TIME OFF ON THAT

01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:44.965
BABY. ARE THEIR PARENT NEEDS

01:41:45.032 --> 01:41:46.633
THEM THEY JUST DON'T HAVE TO

01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:47.601
THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT IS

01:41:47.668 --> 01:41:49.403
YOUR PERSONAL. THEY SHOULD BE

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:49.970
AND THAT'S- REALLY WHERE I

01:41:50.037 --> 01:41:50.637
THINK. WE NEED TO BE HAD IT BUT

01:41:50.704 --> 01:41:51.905
I THINK WE'RE IN. A BETTER

01:41:51.972 --> 01:41:53.807
POSITION THAN WE'VE EVER BEEN

01:41:53.874 --> 01:41:55.209
BEFORE IN THIS STATE BECAUSE

01:41:55.275 --> 01:41:56.410
THE MINUTE WE PASSED PAID LEAVE

01:41:56.477 --> 01:41:58.212
GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS WAS OUT AS

01:41:58.278 --> 01:42:00.080
YOU ALL REMEMBER. AND SOMEBODY

01:42:00.147 --> 01:42:01.615
WHO DON'T LIKE THE PROGRAM SOME

01:42:01.682 --> 01:42:03.283
BUT IT'S WAS IN. AND IT WAS A

01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:05.486
FIGHT EVEN TO NOT HAVE

01:42:05.552 --> 01:42:07.421
DECIMATED PROGRAM DIFFERENT

01:42:07.488 --> 01:42:10.824
WAYS. SO THAT'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:42:10.891 --> 01:42:11.492
OUR WORK HAS BEEN PROTECTING

01:42:11.558 --> 01:42:12.659
INTERACTIVE. AND THAT. I'M

01:42:12.726 --> 01:42:14.061
STILL ONE OF THE THINGS. I

01:42:14.127 --> 01:42:19.166
THINK. IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN

01:42:19.233 --> 01:42:19.733
WE'RE LOOKING AT KIND OF THE

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:24.171
MOVEMENT. THIS HOW MEANINGFUL

01:42:24.238 --> 01:42:25.973
THE PROBE. IS OR JUST THE RIGHT

01:42:26.039 --> 01:42:26.640

KNOW THAT WE ALWAYS KIND OF

01:42:28.242 --> 01:42:28.775
GROUND OURSELVES IN. WHY THIS

01:42:28.842 --> 01:42:29.276
MATTERS TO US INTO OUR

01:42:29.343 --> 01:42:29.843
ORGANIZATIONS. AND THE

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:30.444
COMMUNITIES WE REPRESENT AND

01:42:30.511 --> 01:42:32.079
WHETHER IT'S PEOPLE. FIGHTING

01:42:32.145 --> 01:42:33.347

01:42:34.848 --> 01:42:36.950
ORGANIZER'S. OF PEOPLE ALL TALK

01:42:37.017 --> 01:42:38.452
ABOUT WHY THIS SHOULD BE

01:42:38.519 --> 01:42:39.786
SOMETHING THAT REALLY WORKS

01:42:39.853 --> 01:42:41.255
FOR. YOU KNOW THEM IN THEIR

01:42:41.321 --> 01:42:43.156

THREE KIDS TO AND THAT'S THAT'S

01:42:47.661 --> 01:42:51.765
HARD. THAT IS TO HAVE ONE'S I

01:42:51.832 --> 01:42:52.633
USED TO THINK- WHEN WE PASSED A

01:42:52.699 --> 01:42:53.400
LEVY A BUT I'LL TAKE IT FROM MY

01:42:53.467 --> 01:42:54.134
PARENTS AND DAY. AND I HAD

01:42:54.201 --> 01:42:54.968
TWINS THAT IT WAS A HIGH RISK

01:42:55.035 --> 01:42:57.204
PREGNANCY. AND I WAS OUT ON

01:42:57.271 --> 01:42:58.438
PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE AND

I NEEDED PAID LEAVE- BEEN IT

01:43:00.641 --> 01:43:03.243
JUST WAS SO MEANINGFUL FOR ME.

01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:05.245
TO BE ABLETO HAVE THAT TIME-

01:43:05.312 --> 01:43:07.047

01:43:07.114 --> 01:43:09.917
THAT- IN MY SPARE TIME I WORK

01:43:09.983 --> 01:43:14.121

01:43:14.187 --> 01:43:14.721
RIGHTS AND I WAS AT A BIGGEST.

01:43:14.788 --> 01:43:17.090
BILLY AND IT INGLEWOOD. TONS OF

01:43:17.157 --> 01:43:17.624
RENTERS ALL OVER THE STATE

01:43:17.691 --> 01:43:18.225
WHERE THERE AND IT WAS A LONG

01:43:18.292 --> 01:43:19.059
LINE FOR LANCE. I'M OVERLY

01:43:19.126 --> 01:43:20.127
FRIENDLY AND REALLY NOSY. THE

01:43:20.193 --> 01:43:21.795
WOMAN BEHIND ME I SO TALKING TO

01:43:21.862 --> 01:43:24.431
HER. AND SHE HAS WORKED AT A

01:43:24.498 --> 01:43:26.466
JOB FOR FOURTEEN YEARS. TOOK

01:43:26.533 --> 01:43:28.368
TIME OFF BECAUSE HER DAUGHTER

01:43:28.435 --> 01:43:29.670
HAD. A SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION

01:43:29.736 --> 01:43:31.104
WAS IN THE HOSPITAL AND THEY

01:43:31.171 --> 01:43:33.540
FIRED HER. AND IT'S THE GUY

01:43:33.607 --> 01:43:34.675
KNOWS ENOUGH TO KNOW IT

01:43:34.741 --> 01:43:35.208
DEFINITELY A LARGE ENOUGH

01:43:35.275 --> 01:43:37.411
EMPLOYER. GIVING YOU HER.

CONTACT INFO. SHE SAID I COULD.

01:43:40.714 --> 01:43:41.615
SO THIS IS JUST IT'S NOT

01:43:41.682 --> 01:43:42.215
WORKING FOR EVERYBODY EQUALLY

01:43:42.282 --> 01:43:44.551
WHEN I TAKE IT. I NOT ONLY. MY

01:43:44.618 --> 01:43:49.222
BOSS WAS THE WOMAN WHO TRAPPED

01:43:49.289 --> 01:43:49.823
TOM RANKIN IN THE CAR AND MADE

01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:54.328
HIM. BECOME THE COAST. THIS IS

01:43:54.394 --> 01:43:54.828
A VERY BEHIND THAT'S THE

01:43:54.895 --> 01:43:55.429
PHARMACY WAS VERY BEHIND PAID

01:43:55.495 --> 01:43:56.096
LEAVE. SO I HAD A UNION

01:43:56.163 --> 01:43:56.730
CONTRACTS SO EVEN IF MY BOSS

01:43:56.797 --> 01:43:57.331
CHANGED HER MIND. I HAD A LOT

01:43:57.397 --> 01:43:57.965
OF THINGS GOING FOR ME WHEN I

01:43:58.031 --> 01:44:00.067

01:44:00.133 --> 01:44:01.435
EVERYBODY TO HAVE THAT SAME YOU

01:44:01.501 --> 01:44:03.236
KNOW THING AND THAT'S WHY WE-

01:44:03.303 --> 01:44:04.838
EVEN THOUGH WE PASSED THE LEAVE

01:44:04.905 --> 01:44:06.173
EVEN THOUGH WE'VE EXPANDED THAT

01:44:06.239 --> 01:44:07.608
THAT'S WHY I THINK. SO MANY

01:44:07.674 --> 01:44:09.242
ORGANIZATIONS ARE COMING

01:44:09.309 --> 01:44:10.877
TOGETHER IN DECEMBER. TO PLAN

01:44:10.944 --> 01:44:14.114
OUR WORK FOR THE NEXT YEAR. AND

01:44:14.181 --> 01:44:15.649
IT REALLY JUST COUNTY TOP DOWN

THINGS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

01:44:18.885 --> 01:44:22.322
THAT THEY NEED TO GO. OVER A- I

KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING. WE NEED

01:44:32.299 --> 01:44:36.103

THOUSAND DOLLARS TAKING IT. I

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.682
THAT REIGNS AT VERY DIFFERENT

01:44:48.749 --> 01:44:49.282
