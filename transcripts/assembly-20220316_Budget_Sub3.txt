MORE EAGER TO COULD BRINGING OUR UNIQUE. TO TACKLE THE CRIME CRISIS. IN APPROVAL HEALTH IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND EVEN TIED COLLECT THAT MARC. DEVELOPMENT DRIVE LED BY THAT WOULD ORGANIZE OUR EFFORTS ACROSS A- PRIVATE DOCTORS UP. I'M GOOD WITH THAT OKAY THANK YOU AND WE LOOK FOR IF YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DO WE HAVE- COMMENTS FROM ALEJO MISTER CHAIRMAN BURKE GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING ROSS BROWN AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- SO AS YOU HEARD FROM THE ADMINISTRATION- IT IS PROPOSING- SIX POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE OVER FIVE YEARS FROM A VARIETY OF FUN SOURCES FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. ABOUT THREE POINT NINE BILLION FROM LAST YEAR ARE YOU GET A TOTAL OF TEN BILLION AND THE FIGURE BEGINNING ON PAGE TWELVE OF YOUR AGENDA KIND OF BREAKS ALL THAT SPINNING OUT INTO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES. A HIGH LEVEL MOST OF THE FUNDING WOULD GO TO- EXISTING PROGRAMS BUT THERE ARE SOME NEW PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE A- ONE POINT FIVE BILLION ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUS PROGRAM WHICH I KNOW WAS HEARD IN A DIFFERENT SUBCOMMITTEES I'M NOT GONNA FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THAT. YOUR TODAY- THREE HUNDRED MILLION EQUITABLE AT HOME CHARGING PROGRAM WHAT YOU HEARD ABOUT. AND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE MILLION FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THAT. FEELING INFRASTRUCTURE- OVERALL ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE NEW FUNDING WITH SUPPORT HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AND OFF ROAD EQUIPMENT- AND- SO I'M JUST GONNA GO THROUGH THAT'S KIND OF AT A HIGH LEVEL SORT OF DESCRIPTION OF THE- THE PACKAGE. WHEN I GO THROUGH WE REALLY STARTED NOW OFFICE OF THE PACKAGE A FEW WEEKS AGO. POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE AND ON THE COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE AND MY WALK THROUGH A FEW OF THE KEY POINTS- FIRST- I THINK JUST AS- A- BIG. PICTURE OF THE LEGISLATURE WE REALLY JUST HAVE TO CONSIDER. THE PROPOSAL MIX OF SPENDING IS CONSISTENT WITH ITS PRIORITIES- AND WHICH PROGRAMS KIND OF ACHIEVE ITS PRIORITIES FAST SO. TIGHTLY WHAT IS THAT BUDGET ALLOCATIONS FOR MOBILE SOURCE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO DEPEND ON. HOW IT PRIORITIZES DIFFERENT POLICY GOALS SO FOR EXAMPLE. MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE A GOALS OF ONE OR MORE OF. KIND OF THE FALL OF FOLLOWING THINGS. HOW GAS PRODUCTION. NEAR TROPICAL WORKS UNBLOCK- TECHNO. TYPE ADVANCED TO KIND OF A CHEAP LAW TERM- KEIICHI AIR POLLUTION REDUCTION GOALS. AS WELL TRAINER QUALITY BENEFITS ACCRUING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND SO AS WE OUTLINED IN MORE DETAIL IN OUR ANALYSIS THE DEGREE TO WHICH DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO CHEAT EACH OF THESE GOALS- CAN DIFFER PRETTY SUBSTANTIALLY BETWEEN PROGRAM AND THERE ARE SOME INHERENT TRADE OFFS AND SO A LOT OF. SPENDING DECISIONS WILL DEPEND HOW YOU PRIORITIZE THE GOAL SO. OPERATIVE TO THE EXTENT NEAR TERM GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS ARE PRIORITY- THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION SUGGESTS THAT. BUT THE PROGRAM'S PROPOSED THAT EACH THAT HEAVY DUTY VOUCHERS ARE ONE OF THE MORE COST EFFECTIVE MOBILE SOURCE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. OVERALL KIND OF AT THE AT THE PACKAGE A LOT OF THAT KIND OF NEAR TERM GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION COSTS ARE. RELATIVELY HIGH ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO SOME OF THE OTHER REGULATORY PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE HAS RATHER AN INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AT THE STATE HOUSE SO I WOULD JUST HAVE TO KIND OF WHAT IT'S LIKE WANT TO KIND OF KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN THINKINGABOUT ITS- OVERALL PACKAGE AND PRIORITIES. EXTENT NEAR TERM REDUCTIONS AND LOCAL AIR POLLUTION ARE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY OPTION ANY KIND OF SOME OF THE OTHER STATE PROGRAMS- LIKE HEAVY DUTY RETIREMENT REPLACEMENT PROGRAMS WHICH ARE NOT PART OF THIS PACKAGE BUT A PART OF THE- OVERALL BUDGET. GOING FORWARD- SUCH AS KERR WEITERER FARMER SB SIX SEVENTEEN WHICH I'LL DISCUSS I THINK AT A LATER ITEM. OTHERS ARE APPEAR TO BE KIND OF MORE COST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO ACHIEVE. OF LOCAL AIR POLLUTION REDUCTIONS- TO THE EXTENT LONGER TERM GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS IN AIR POLLUTION REDUCTIONS ARE A PRIORITY THAN THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO FOCUS ON KIND OF EFFORTS TO. ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES IN ADVANCE CAN OPEN THAT TECHNOLOGIES- IN THIS CASE THE LEGISLATURE COULD TARGET FUNDING TO PROGRAMS. AT TECHNOLOGY IN THE EARLY STAGES A MARKET OF. FOR EXAMPLE. PRIORITY IN. FOR HEAVY TO. PILOTS AND IN. WORKED FOR. HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE AND OFF ROAD EQUIPMENT THEY'RE KIND OF IN THE- EARLIER STAGES THE MARKET DEVELOPMENT. AND FINAL A KIND OF IF THE PRIORITIES A TRAINER IMPROVEMENTS MOSTLY TO. DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THE LEGISLATURE COULD TARGET FUNDS TO THE PROGRAMS THAT REDUCE BOTH PRODUCED RIGHT HERE UP POLLUTANTS COST EFFECTIVELY- AND WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF SPENDING BENEFITS LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND AGAIN- ARE THIS PACKAGE BUT I KNOW YOU LET'S GUESS LATER ON SORT OF A B. SIX SEVENTEEN INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THEIR- CREDIT. RATING HIGHLY ON KIND OF BOTH OF THOSE METRICS AND SO- WE CAN BE THERE IS KIND OF A FEW OF THE KIND OF BIG PICTURE THINGS TO THINK ABOUT WHEN THINKING ABOUT HOW TO PRIORITIZE YOUR GENERAL FUND RESOURCES ON MOBILE SOURCE PROGRAMS AS WELL AS YOUR FUTURE A PACKAGE. THE SECOND- BLOOD. WE THINK MY TO. IN A GROUP. AT THAT BUDGET HEARINGS HERE TODAY ON THE DETAIL OF THE NEW PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED. APPLE THE EQUITABLE AT HOME CHARGING PROGRAM FOR LOW INCOME AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. OUR PROGRAM TARGET RENTERS- HOW OLD DENTURE BENEFICIARIES BE NOTIFIED OF AVAILABILITY OF THE FUNDS. AND HOW THE PROGRAM DIFFERENT FROM OTHER STATE PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM. AND SO WE THINK SOME OF THAT ADDITIONAL DETAIL COULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE BETTER EVALUATE. THAT THE MERITS OF THE PROPOSED NEW PROGRAM. THIRD I CAN DRINK FLUIDS THREE ARE NAY THREE NO FOUR AB TRUCKING. THROUGH FEDERAL FORMULA PROGRAM THROUGH THE FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE. THERE'S ALSO AN ADDITIONAL THREE BILLION DOLLARS NATIONWIDE AND FEDERAL GRANT FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH A COMPETITIVE PROGRAM AND THE DETAILS FOR THESE FEDERAL PROGRAMS ARE REALLY BEEN RELEASED YET- BUT WE DO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO REPORT- THIS SPRING ON ITS PLAN FOR ENSURING THE STATE FUNDING FOR THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE WILL COMPLEMENT THIS NEW FEDERAL FUNDING. SO IT'S GOING TO FOR EXAMPLE DESCRIPTION OF HOW IT BUT ALL THE STATE FUNDING CAN BE USED TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGH A STATE MATCH FOR EXAMPLE OR HOW IT ALL BUT ADMINISTRATION IS PLANNING ON USING IT TO FILL IN THE GAPS AND FEDERAL FUNDING. AND IF THERE'S ANY SPECIAL DETAIL ON KIND OF THESE TYPES OF QUESTIONS WE THINK ABOUT A SIGNIFICANT DELAY I'VE BEEN TO DIFFERENT STATE FUNDING UNTIL MORE DETAILS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE ADMINISTRATION. DEVELOPS A CLEAR STRATEGY. AND FINALLY- I WOULD RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE CONSIDER. OFFICERS WHAT KIND OF THE MULTI YEAR FUND- A PRO IT ADMINISTRATION HAS PRESENTED THIS YEAR SO THIS PACKAGE INCLUDES OVER. THREE POINT ABOUT. THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS IN OUT HERE GENERAL FUND COMMITMENTS- AND REALLY THERE ARE JUST. WE THINK THEY'RE JUST KIND OF SOME IMPORTANT TRADE OFFS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER SO ON THE ONE HAND. THE COMMITMENTS ARE THESE KIND OF MULTI YEAR COMMITMENTS CAN PROVIDE MARKET CERTAINTY AND MAKE IT EASIER. A TWELVE MAKE IT EASIER FOR DEPARTMENTS TO DESIGNER MINISTER PROGRAM SO FOR EXAMPLE- THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE KIND OF MARKET CERTAINTY TO BUSINESSES CONSIDERING LONG TERM INVESTMENTS SUCH AS TRANSITIONING PLEASE TO ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES. AND ALSO THERE COULD BE GREATER CERTAINTY ABOUT HOW FUNDING CAN HELP OUR STATE DEPARTMENT'S GOING TO DESIGN PROGRAMS IN WAIT A WAIT THAT AVOID. STRUCTURE IN SUCH AS WAY PLUS. AND THE OTHER HAND HOW THE POTENTIAL TO READ LETTERS OVER HAVING MULTI COMMITMENT BECAUSE- A NEW PURPLE DOESN'T HAVE TO COME BACK TO YOU I DON'T HAVE TO BE SUBMITTED IN FUTURE YEARS FOR THE- FUTURE OF YOUR FUNDING- WE DO THINK THERE ARE WAYS TO KIND OF ADDRESS THIS OVERSIGHT ISSUE BY. ENSURING THAT THERE ARE KIND OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO YOU- GOING FORWARD AND SO YOU CAN HAVE GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE FUNDING IS BEING ROLLED OUT HOW SUCCESSFUL IT IS. I THINK THE OTHER COMPARATIVELY IN IT IS. A KIND OF OUT YOUR GENERAL FUND PRESSURES AND SO YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT AS PART OF A LARGER BUCKET BUDGET PACKAGE- I WILL. IN MY- THERE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU AND COMMITTEE HOUSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I THINK THAT TECH INCLUDES ALL OF THE PRESENTATIONS WE HAVE THIS MORNING WILL MOVE ON TO QUESTIONS BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT WILL TAKE ROLE. AND WELCOME. ARCHER MISTER CHANG HI EVERYBODY YOUR MULLIN PATTERSON RIVAS SMITH HERE CHANGE. THERE. ALLOW ME THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION- WHAT ARE WE DOING TO ASSURE RELIABILITY OF- ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WERE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ON- AND WILL- SURELY START TO- OBSOLESCENT NEED MAINTENANCE IN THE FUTURE WITH THE PLAN FOR THAT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION IT IS AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND I RECALL- THEY WILL CAME UP LAST YEAR TOO AND RIGHTLY SO WE'VE GOT TO START TAKING ACTION ON THIS ALREADY- SPENT THE FIRST PART OF THAT YOUR- RETIREMENT A LITTLE BIT INTERNALLY AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM AND THEN WE HELD A WORKSHOP- ABSOLUTE TRACK OF TIME EITHER THIS WEEK OR JUST LAST WEEK. WE REALLY WANT TO DO A COUPLE THIRTY THROUGH THE PROCESS. WE WANT TO ONE DEFINED WHAT RELIABILITY REALLY NEED. ANOTHER BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE LAST YEAR. WE'RE GONNA TRACK THE RELIABILITY OF THE INVESTMENT FOR THE GENERAL FUND. WE WANT TO GO BROADER NOT WE ALSO WANT TO SEE WHAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY DO BURKE. FUNDED INFRASTRUCTURE UTILITY FUNDED INFRASTRUCTURE. EVEN PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE. THE FIRST ONE TO GET A SENSE OF HOW DO WE DEFINE IT. THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS. AND EFFECTIVELY HOW DO WE TRACK IT. WE DEFINITELY WANT TO FIND THE BALANCE WHERE WE CAN DO IT I BROUGHT FASHION WHERE WE DON'T MAKE A REALLY COSTLY. ON THE SERVICE PROVIDERS AND PRIVATE MARKET TO PROVIDE. THAT DATA. WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH THAT. SO WE'RE GONNA GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS THAT HERE AND HOPEFULLY- START GETTING A BETTER SENSE OF HOW WE CAN AGAIN TO FIND IT AND TRACK IT. I WILL PAY FOR THIS LOCATION WE WANT TO LIVE HERE. WE'RE REQUIRE REQUIRING NINETY SEVEN PERCENT. BUT. IN THE LAST. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS. FRIEDMAN HI GOOD MORNING AND I WANNA BE- PROBABLY THE MILLIONTH PERSON TO CONGRATULATE OUR CHAIR- THIS MORNING ON BECOMING A GRANDDADDY I DON'T THINK HE SAID AFTER MILEY UNDER THAT MASK SINCE I WALKED IN THE IN THE ROOM AND THE HIDING MY SMILE SHE- SO GOOD I. LATER I PROMISE THANK YOU VERY HAPPY FOR YEARS I'VE GOT SOME QUESTIONS AND THEY'RE REALLY FOR WHOEVER WANTS TO ANSWER ON THE PANEL- THE FIRST ONE IS. A YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE A LITTLE CONCERT FIRST OF ALL I'M I'M REALLY THRILLED OF- THE GOALS IN CALIFORNIA AND THE GOVERNOR'S- DESIRE TO REPLACE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES WITH ZAPS AND I. I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT MOVE THIS IS THE MOMENT WE SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH GAS PRICES WERE. EXPERIENCING WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD AS HAD TO DEALWITH FOR A LONG TIME WHICH IS VERY HIGH GAS PRICES AND VOLATILITY THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE- IT'S YOU KNOW BEEN. GIVING PEOPLE THE RELIEF OF MOVING INTO A VEHICLE THAT DOESN'T. RELY ON FOSSIL FUELS IS A HUGE GIFT TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND WILL YOU KNOW LONG RUN BE MUCH HEALTHIER FOR COMMUNITIES FOR. FOR AIR QUALITY FOR EVERYTHING ELSE SO THIS IS THIS IS THE MOMENT AND I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT WE ARE SEIZING IT. I DO WONDER ABOUT THE- DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE IN TERMS OF WHICH THEY HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE TO FIND I AM CONCERNED THAT WE MAKE A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHERE TO PUT CHARGING STATIONS FOR INSTANCE AND HOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO USE THEM- DO THEY PREFER TO HAVE IT IN THERE YOU KNOW IN THEIR APARTMENT BUILDING OR OR AT WORK. OR AT TARGET. I RETAIL NEUTRAL AT. LARGE STORE. THAT THEY GO TO A LOT- DO THEY YOU KNOW IT IF WE PUT IT IN AN APARTMENT BUILDING WHAT HAPPENS THEN TO. YOU KNOW IS THE BUILDINGS CAN IT CAN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORTED. DO THEY TURN AROUND AND CHARGE THAT RESIDENT A LOT OF MONEY TO USE IT- DOES A BIG DO WE CREATE STRANDED ASSETS- YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF THE SHOULD BE PUBLIC HOW MUCH SHOULD BE PRIVATE- ALL OF THOSE SORTS OF QUESTIONS SO MY QUESTION IS. YOU'RE CERTAINLY WE CAN'T ANSWER ALL OF THOSE BUT WE CAN THINK A LOT ABOUT THEM AND HAVE A STRATEGY SO MY QUESTION IS. WHAT HOW O WE DEVELOP THIS ROAD MAP WHO'S SORT OF IN CHARGE OF MAKING THE DECISIONS. DO WE HAVE A ROBUST GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT INCLUDES THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO. MOVE THESE CHARGERS INTO MORE AGGRESSIVELY ARE WE LISTENING TO THEM DIRECTLY ABOUT THEIR NEEDS OR ARE WE MAKING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE THE MOST CONVENIENT TO THEM. OR WHAT WOULD SPUR. THEIR SWITCHED TO US HAVE SO- THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION IS HOW ARE THESE HOW ARE THE CITING. AND THE FUNDING DECISIONS BEING MADE AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND AT THE END AND DO WE FEEL THAT A CONFIDENT ENOUGH THAT IT'S A ROBUST ENOUGH GROUP OF. PEOPLE AND DO WE HAVE METRICS SO THAT WE CAN COURSE CORRECT QUICKLY IF WE DECIDE THAT WE ARE. PUTTING A LOT OF MONEY INTO INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S NOT IT BEING UNDER UTILIZED. THAT THAT'S NOT A GREAT QUESTION- PART OF OUR ANALYSIS THAT THAT GOES INTO THAT IF IT FROM THE TOOL OF THE LEGISLATURE GIVEN OUT THOUGH. AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN HAS BEEN A REALLY POWERFUL TOOL FOR US. AND ALSO SENATE BILL ONE THOUSAND AND HOW WE SITE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE ALWAYS WANT TO FIND A BALANCE WE'RE NOT BEING OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE BUT ALSO GIVEN SOME DIRECTION. BOND SO WHETHER KELLY B. I. P. PROGRAM FOR INSTANCE. WE USE MODELING TO TARGET WITH A LARGER CAPS ARE. FROM WHERE WE SEE VEHICLE- PROLIFERATING AND THAT ALSO WERE EXPECTED TO COME. IN WITH A LOWER LEVEL OF INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WE TARGET GAPS IN THAT WAY- YEAH ONE THING I'VE LEARNED IS THAT NO ONE HAS ALL THE ANSWERS TO THOSE. AND WE NEED TO EMPOWER THE PRIVATE MARKET. ATTENTION WE WANT TO MAKE A HAND UP TO THE PRIVATE MARKET. WE ALSO WANT TO SET. TARGETS SO FOR OUR FUNDING WE HAVE A 50% MINIMUM FOR A LARGE NUMBER NOT THAT THE MUST GOT DOCTOR LOW INCOME. SUBSIDY 50% ON THE MEDIUM DUTY HEAVY DUTY SIDE. HERE BUT FOR THE. PLANNING PROCESS GOES. WE'LL OF WORKSHOPS THINK AS WE MOVE. TO FULLY HAN PERCENT VERY MUCH. WE ARE THAT RISK OF STRANDED ON. DOES AT MINIMUM BECAUSE WE KNOW EVERY- WHO. OR OPERATES CAR. IS GOING% TO NEED. A PLACE TO CHARGE. WITH AT HOME CHARGING THE THING THAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT IT IN OUR SYSTEM AND DATA SHOWED THAT. IS THAT- IF IT'S CHEAPER FUEL COSTS FOR MOST PEOPLE. THE RESIDENTIAL TERRAPIN RATES ARE CHEAPER THAN THE- COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL HAVE DEMAND CHARGES. SO WE REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE. IT CHEAPER FOR FOLKS TO DO IT INCLUDING THOSE M. U. D. RENTERS ALSO IT'S MORE CONVENIENT IT IS LIKE A CELL PHONE ON THAT PHONE WHEN YOU PLUG IT IN AT NIGHT. YOU HAVE IT ALL DAY TOP RATE AND I WORRIED ABOUT FINDING A PLACE TO FUEL. IS ALSO WHAT MARGARET FRIENDLY. WE TO DEPLOY LOW TWO CHARGE. FOR THE STUDY INSTEAD OF TO RELY HEAVILY ON. FIVE STARTERS. WE KNOW WE NEED BOTH OF THOSE- BUT REALLY WANTED. AT HOME TARGET ONE MORE WHERE THAT MAKE SENSE. AND WE HAVE A- WELDER PASTA. PART OF IT IS DESIGNED. WHICH ALLOW PARTIES. TO IMPLEMENT ON OUR BEHALF BECAUSE WE WE'RE NOT ALL THE AND- SEVEN SEVEN. THAT MAY BE. TO DATE ORDER. I THE VA. FOR OTHER PARTY HELP THE PLAN THAT FUNDING. THANK YOU I'M- I'M ALSO WONDERING WHETHER YOU WHETHER- CARB OR- YOU KNOW I WHO WERE OR ANY OF THE OTHER AGENCIES ARE LOOKING AT REMOVING SOME OF THE BARRIERS TO COMMERCIAL CHARGING AND SO I HEAR A LOT FROM VARIOUS CHARGING COMPANIES THAT ARE LOOKING TO INSTALL CHARGING STATIONS AND THEY BRING UP A LOT OF BARRIERS THAT WOULD THAT ARE PREVENTING THEM FROM- FROM DOING INFRASTRUCTURE WORK THAT WE WANT YOU KNOW FROM THE FROMTHE PRIVATE SECTOR SIDE AND I'LL JUST NAME A FEW OF THOSE- ONE OF THEM I'VE HEARD IS. HAS TO DO WITH THE- NEED TO UPGRADE- SUBSTATIONS A LOT OF TIMES I ONE OF THEM TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY NEED TO A SUBSTATION UPGRADE FOR A LARGE CHARGING STATION THEY WANTED TO FIND ON THEIR OWN TIME MAYBE EVEN USING SOME STATE INCENTIVES- BUT- THE UTILITY THAT THEY WERE DEALING WITH. SAID THAT THEIR TIME LINE TO GIVE THE APPROVALS WAS TWO YEARS. SO THEY'VE BEEN WAITING NOW FOR OVER A YEAR THEY SAID THERE'S NO. YOU KNOW. NO IDEA WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY HAVE THE SUBSTATION OPERATED. AND SO FORTH YOU KNOW THAT'S A HUGE BARRIER- TO EVEN TO ROLLING OUT THE FUNDING THAT WE WANT- ANOTHER ONE TALKED ABOUT HOW- EVEN THOUGH DURING THE DAY. THE PRICE FOR THE POWER IS NOMINAL WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW A TON OF RENEWABLES ON THE GRID AND YET THEY'RE BEING CHARGED PEAK PRICES. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY ARE FOR THE POWER THAT THEY USE. AND SO THEY HAVE TO PASS THAT ALONG TO THEIR THEIR USERS. SO I'M WONDERING WHETHER WE'RE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ALL OF THE VARIOUS UTILITIES WHO ARE IN SOME WAYS THE GATEKEEPERS THE ELECTRICITY THAT WE'RE USING FOR THESE VEHICLES. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR POLICIES ARE ALIGNING WITH OUR GOALS YOU KNOW AND ALSO THROW INTO THAT. THE POSSIBILITY OF ALL THESE EV'S BEING USED AS GRID RESILIENCY YOU KNOW. WITH THE POSSIBILITY WITH TECHNOLOGY ALLOWING THEM TO FEED ENERGY BACK INTO THOSE PRIVATE RESIDENCES WHEN POWER'S BEEN TO BEEN- TURNED OFF BECAUSE OF WILDFIRE OR OTHER OR HIGH WIND EVENTS. AT THE END THE RELUCTANCE AND SEEMS OF THE UTILITIES TO OVER TO HELP. PEOPLE TO INSTALL BATTERY STORAGE TO DO EXACTLY THAT SO WHAT WHERE IS THE UTILITY TIÞN AND HOW RECEPTIVE HAVE YOU BEEN TO HELPING TO BE IN DISCUSSIONS TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS TO. FURTHER YOU KNOW FURTHER DEPLOYMENT OF ALL OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE. I KNOW THAT WAS A BIG QUESTION WITH A LOT OF EXAMPLES BUT THIS IS THE KIND OF THING I HEAR ALL THE TIME. FROM COMPANIES THAT ARE TRYING TO DO CHARGING IN SAYING WE HAVE THE MONEY WE HAVE THE CAPITAL WE CAN'T. BUILD THESE RIGHT NOW THERE'S JUST TOO MANY BARRIERS. TIMELINE'S PERMITTING COST OF USE NOT HAVING- DEMAND PRICING ALL OF THAT. I BELIEVE THAT- DIRECTOR CAR BUT- I KNOW THE ENERGY COMMISSION- HOW LONG THIS CONVERSATION THE CORRECT I DO WANT TO TAKE THE PLUNGE. I THINK THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE I CAN JUMP IN WITH ANYTHING ELSE. OKAY GREAT- AND I CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT PLEASE TELL THE FACT TO OFFEND A LEVIN YEARS- AT A CALIFORNIA TELL THE BEFORE JOINING STATE SERVICE. AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK THERE IS A REAL CONCERN ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE UTILITIES ARE ABLE TO DEPLOY THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AHEAD OF IT- I WORRY MORE FRANKLY ON THE MEDIUM DUTY HEAVY DUTY SIDE. BUT ALSO WHEN YOU HAVE A LARGE BANK VIDAK HERDERS. SOME OF THAT PLANNING HAPPENS NATURALLY YOU KNOW BE IT FOR ANYTHING. NO NEED CITY DEVELOPMENTS THE APARTMENT THE CONDO REALLY ANYTHING. BUT WE FIGURED POCKETS WE NEED TO GET HAD ABOUT. WANTING. TO- DEPRESSION AND DOING. HAVE WE STARTED AGE. A THANK. PRETTY EARLY DAYS THE IT AND WE'RE WAITING A POLICY REALLY TRY TO FRAME IT AND SEE HOW IT FITS. WITH OTHER RAPPERS. WE WANTED A LITTLE OF AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM. SO WE KNOW WE'RE THE VEHICLES ARE COMING WHERE THE CHARGING STATIONS ARE COMING. AND HOW WE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH OUR HYPER DEMAND FORECASTS. AND OTHER- IF YOU SEE HOW TO FOR CAPITAL PROJECT- AND HOW CAN WE REALLY LOOK AT THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. YOU CAN BY AND LARGE A LOT OF THE CONCERNED WE'RE HEARING COULD NOT SO MUCH THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM. IT REALLY THAT DIFFERENT DISTRIBUTION CIRCUIT. WHICH MIGHT BE NEARING CAPACITY LIMITS. ON WHAT THEY THOUGHT THEM DOWN. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT YOU KNOW WE ALSO HAVE THE INTERCONNECTION AND PLUMMETING. OUR TWO THINGS THAT CAUSE DELAYS AND COSTS BOB BECAUSE- ANOTHER SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING TO GET- OUR ARMS WRAPPED AROUND A LITTLE BIT BETTER- BUT IT TOOK A LOT OF MONEY THAT ALREADY OCCURRED BUT I THINK WE GET SHARPER. SHARPEN OUR PENCILS. ON THOSE SPECIFIC DISTRIBUTION OR PETER AND TAX- BUT EVERY CONDUCTOR IN THE WIND. OR SUBSTATION- PIECES. I KNOW LARGE I USE HAS IT. THAT I BELIEVE THE P. HAVE THE PER. THE NEW- RATED NINETY. ONE OF THEM. THAT I MITIGATE REDUCING DEMAND FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. BUT THE DEMAND FOR OF COME BACK AND OVERTIME. AND THEN ON THE LAST COMPONENT- ABOUT BI DIRECTIONAL. THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE WE'RE LOOKING TO TACKLE WE THIS IS I HEARD THAT ONE OF THE TELL THE I'VE HEARD IT ON THE SIDE OF IT AS WELL. IS THAT THERE ARE UTILITIES ARE HESITANT TO CONNECT. SOME BI DIRECTIONAL CHARGER AND LEFT IT ON THE EQUIVALENT. OF THE SOLAR INVERTER LIST. AND THAT WAS SOMETHING CREATED FOR SOLAR- SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO MAKE SURE WE GOT. OLDER INTERCONNECTS OKAY. SO I WOULDN'T FEEL THE TRANSPORTATION WERE LOOKING TO CREATE A COROLLARY TO THAT PROVIDE DIRECTIONAL PARKER. WHAT SPECIFICALLY THE INVERTER ON A CHARGER SO WE CAN DO BI DIRECTIONAL FUNCTIONALITY- I BELIEVE TEACHING YOU HAVE BEEN PRETTY PROGRESS MILITARIA. DAY IN FLORIDA JUST HAD AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY'RE GONNA GAPS- FORD F. ONE FIFTY- LIGHTNING. OUT THERE TO HELP MITIGATE THE PF YET THE BAND. BECAUSE THE GREAT THING ABOUT ELECTRIC VEHICLE THAT I THINK YOU KNOW IT BECAUSE OF THE QUESTION ABOUT. IT THAT THE IT COULD PROVIDE ONSITE RESILIENCY IN A WAY THAT A GAS VEHICLE NEVER CRIED. YEAH A FORD F. ONE FIFTY. SIX SEVEN YEAR EIGHTY KILOWATT HOUR CAPACITY BATTERY. COULD PROVIDE ENERGY FOR THREE DAYS. AND OTHER EVENTS SO THAT REAL THE TOPIC TODAY IS NOT THE FUTURE OF THE BANK. BUT THEY'RE STILL BARRIERS. WE WANT TO TACKLE. AND ADDITION TO THAT BY DIRECTIONAL WILL LOOK TO CREATE. ONE OF OUR SISTER- IT'S FUNDING COULD BE A CALL THE BILL. FOR THE TASTE. I BELIEVE THAT SOME OF CORPORATE OF THAT WE'RE DOING- YOU KNOW EVERYTHING YOU CAN THINK TO MAKE THAT. AND MORE. AND ALWAYS OF MORE I OF HOW TACKLE BARRIERS. I THINK THAT REALLY COVERS FIELD FOR. GIVEN HOW. ON EDUCATION IT'S ON ALL OF THESE FRIENDS THANK YOU THE ALL I'LL ADD. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THAT WE WERE WORKING AND WITH SUCH WITH FLEETS HEAVY DUTY FLEETS WOULD YOU WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE ALSO WORKING ON INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING AND CONNECTING WITH FOLKS SAID WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD PARTNERSHIP ACROSS. THIS FRONT AND WE'VE BEEN. REALLY GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE SAID STATEWIDE PLANNING EFFORTS THAT EDUCATION YOU TO THE COMMISSION TYSON OTHERS ARE CONTRIBUTING. THANKS FOR BACK. OF THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF CHAIR BLOOM AT THE FIRST THING I'D LIKE TO SAY IS A HEDGE ADD SOME COMMENTS HERE LATER BUT I'M GONNA DO THIS NOW THEY FOLLOW UP ON THE CHAIR OF TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEES- ACTUALLY QUESTIONS- AND- I WANT TO ADD TO THOSE IN MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PORCH THE PORCH- SOME OF THE PORT PEOPLE I'VE TALKED TO DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE THAT WHEN THEY ELECTRIFY THE WHOLE PORT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE ENOUGH- DELIVERY OF POWER- FROM. FROM THE GRID- FOR WHAT THEY NEED- AND- SO THINK OF ALL OF THE POSSIBILITIES SAID- WE JUST HEARD DARE YOU KNOW WHICH WAY ARE WE GONNA BE ABLE TO FEED POWER BACK IN THERE SO MANY THERE'S SO MANY COMPLICATING THINGS HERE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE- THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION- INVOLVED IN MAKING SURE THAT- WE HAVE A COORDINATED PLAN- BUT THAT LEADS ME TO ONE OF MY CONCERNS AND THAT IS WHEN YOU HAVE DIVIDED RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CPUC HERE. YEAH THIS ENERGY COMMISSION YOU HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION WHEN YOU HAVE DIVIDED RESPONSIBILITY THERE'S A IT REALLY IS HARD TO HAVE THE APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTABILITY TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A COORDINATED PLAN GOING FORWARD- AND WE HAVE DIVIDED RESPONSIBILITY BY THE NATURE OF THE LIVES OF THE WAY WE'VE SET UP- DEMOCRACIES IN THE COUNTRY AND CRITICALLY WHAT WHAT WE HAVE HERE- IN CALIFORNIA AND IT REMINDS ME OF THAT OF THE CLASSIC- WHEN I WAS DOING MY STUDENT TEACHING AND S. AS IN A STUDENT TEACHER ASKED TO SAID. SO HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE PREPARED ENOUGH AND THE RESPONSE WAS YOU YOU'RE NEVER YOU CAN NEVER HAVE TO COMPLETE OF A PLAN AS MUCH TIME AS YOU HAVE AS MUCH ENERGY AS YOU CAN PLAN AND KEEP PLANNING THEIR IT THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN AND I WOULD OFFER- THAT WHEN WE. NEED A CONCERTED EFFORT- OF EVERYBODY COMING TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PLAN AND THE PLAN WILL HAVE TO BE AN ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT PLAN AS THINGS CHANGE. BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT WE DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE- ALL OF THE COORDINATION THAT WE NEED TO GO FORWARD AS ROOM AS FOR MAKING THESE BIG INVESTORS. SO WITH THAT- OVERALL I WANT TO COMPLIMENT- THE ADMINISTRATION THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND CARB- FOR THIS PRESENTATION I THINK THAT'S IT THIS IS A VERY GOOD START. A VERY GOOD COMPLEMENT TO THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE HAVE HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE- GOING FORWARD- I HAVE MANY QUESTIONS HERE. BUT I DON'T NEED LONG ANSWERS TO ALL OF THAT SO WHAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THERE USUALLY JUST SHORT CLARIFICATIONS SO- AND- I WOULD APPRECIATE IF WE CAN KEEP. OF THE ANSWERS AS BRIEF SO THAT- I CAN GET THROUGH THESE QUESTIONS AND- I'M GONNA BE ON- I'M ON PAGE. TEN OF THE- FOR A- OUR ON PAGE OF THE OF THE DOCUMENT- THERE'S A REFERENCE TO- THE THREE HUNDRED KILOWATT OR HIRE A DIRECT CURRENT FAST CHARGERS AND- I'VE BEEN CALCULATING- BASED ON THE- THE INFORMATION ON ON PAGE FOURTEEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR FIVE THOUSAND DC FAST CHARGERS- THAT WORKS OUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A CHARGE IS THAT WHAT- THE ENERGY COMMISSION THINKS IS THE- COST OF THE THREE HUNDRED KILOWATT OR HIGHER- DC FAST CHARGERS. I BELIEVE OUR PORTION WILL BE SOMEWHERE IN THE EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND PER CHARGER WERE ALSO LOOKING TO FIND- GREAT MEDICATION EFFORT FOR THAT IT COULD BE- SOME OF THAT DELTA FUNDING COULD GO THROUGH TO THINGS LIKE CONSERVE ENERGY STORED ALL THE AUTOMATED LOAD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THERE ARE OTHER THINGS TO BALANCE THE LOAD FOR YOU TO HAVE A REALLY HIGH GREAT IMPACT BUT THE PTSD PEAK WOULD BE ABOUT 829-200-1000 DOLLARS PER CHARGE. FOR THE. THREE HUNDRED KILOWATT FAST CHARGERS. SEKARANG AND WE EXPECT THE PRIVATE. SIDE PICK UP THE REST SO JUST TO. THE LEVEL TWO CHARGERS HAVE BEEN A AND HAVE BEEN GETTING A AN AVERAGE INCENTIVE OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND. SO HOW WOULD WE BE GOING TO THREE HUNDRED KILOWATTS WITHOUT IT COSTING MORE. SO THE LEVEL TWO CHARGERS IS ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CHARGER ON THE PUBLIC SIDE ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND TOTAL WHEN YOU FACTOR IN THE PRIVATE INVESTMENT THERE- RIGHT NOW ARE FIFTY TO SEVENTY FIVE K. W. CHARTERED WHAT PUTTING IN ABOUT. FIFTY TO SEVENTY THOUSAND HER PARTNER FOR ABOUT ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- MY NEXT QUESTION IS- THE THREE HUNDRED NINETY MILLION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PAGE GENERAL FUND TO DEPLOY INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT ONE THOUSAND- DRY AGE TRUCKS AND SIXTEEN HUNDRED TRANSIT BUSES. IN SOME PLACES THERE'S A REFERENCE TO THIS ALL B. THESE ALL BEING ELECTRIC ARE THESE TRANSIT BUSES GOING TO ALL BE ELECTRIC. OR IS IT GOING TO BE- TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL IN TERMS OF THE SIZE OF TRANSIT BUSES. OUR INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY TECH NEUTRAL SO WE TALK ABOUT THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES YOU MEAN BATTERY AND FUEL CELL. THURMOND INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE PERPETRATED FROM THE- I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS TWO ANSWERS JUST IN TERMS OF CLARITY COULD CALL SAY THAT AGAIN SO WHEN SOMETIMES PEOPLE USE ELECTRIC AS A SHORTHAND FOR BATTERY. BUT THAT'S NOT THE INTENTION HERE SO THIS IS FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES WHICH COULD BE BATTERY VEHICLES OR FUEL CELL VEHICLES BOTH HER ELECTRIC IN THE FOURTH FOR THE BUSES AND FOR THE DRAYAGE TRUCKS YES THANK YOU THANK YOU OKAY- AND THEN THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN THE GENERAL FUND FOR INFRASTRUCTURE FURS HAVE TRUCKS BUSES AND OFF ROAD EQUIPMENT. COULD COULD SOMEBODY JUST TO BRIEFLY ELABORATE HOW WILL THAT BE IF WILL THAT BE ALLOCATED BASED ON GRANT FUNDING- LIKE MANY OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS. AND THIS IS THIS IS FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S SEGMENT OF THE PRESENTATION SO. YES THAT'S CORRECT- COMPETITIVE GRANT FUNDING THAT CAN GO UP TO ELECTRIC AND HYBRID GREAT THANK YOU AND THIS IS A UNDER THE CARB AND C. E. C. SEGMENT THERE IS A STATEMENT THERE. JUST TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES- AND THEN IT MAKES A REFERENCE AT THE VERY END OF THAT- FIRST PARAGRAPH SAYS. AS WELL AS SUPPORT VEHICLE GRID INTEGRATION AT SCALE. COULD SOMEBODY CLARIFY WHAT VEHICLE GRID INTEGRATION AT SCALE MEANS. BUT CERTAINLY- SO THAT WOULD GO TO THE ENERGY COMMISSION PORTION OF IT AND- WE'RE SEEING SOME REALLY GREAT IN THE VEHICLE GRID INTEGRATION. THAT COULD BE ANYTHING FROM REDUCING THE POWER OF THE TURKEY. AFTER THE MATCH NOT ALWAYS AND I EXCUSE THEM AND ASK YOU TO START OVER AGAIN I'M NOT ABLE FALL THAT YOUR HAVE YOUR MOUSE IS NOT MATCHED UP WITH YOUR SECOND IF YOU COULD. JUST SPEAK A LITTLE MORE SLOWLY I THINK THAT'LL HELP- I APOLOGIZE ABOUT THAT- SO VEHICLE GRID INTEGRATION IS. INTEGRATING NEW VEHICLE LOAD WITH THE GRAND IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER. A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE THINK ABOUT BI DIRECTIONAL FOR THAT. IT CAN ALSO BE A SIMPLER THINGS LIKE RATE DESIGN. FOR REDUCING THE LOAD OF A CHARGING STATION. IN RESPONSE TO A GREAT SIGNAL. SO THAT INVESTMENT WILL GO TO LARGER SEGMENT WTHIN BGI. ONE SEGMENT WOULD BE TO HELP PUSH OUT- SMART CHARGER BIDIRECTIONAL CHARGERS. AND METERING EQUIPMENT. THE OTHER PORTION TO GO TOWARD- HELPING STAND UP AND THE POWER OF THE THIRD PARTY AGGREGATORS. CHIU THAT MAKE A% VERY SEAMLESS CONSUMER EXPERIENCE. CAMINO THE PEOPLE WILL NOT ADOPT THIS UNLESS THERE'S GOOD AUTOMATION. AND A GOOD CONSUMER EXPERIENCE. THE- VEHICLE GRID INTEGRATION. THANK YOU I I'LL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU- MORE ON THAT OUR OF YEAR- FOR THE- ON PAGE THIRTEEN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR SEVEN FOR STRUCTURE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION. EIGHTY THREE MILLION FOR AND IN TERMS OF FEDERAL FUNDS- THE THIS IS. THIS GOING TO BE INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE INTERSTATES- AND- DO WE HAVE PLANS YET IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO ALLOCATE THIS ON THE INTERSTATE IN ON THE INTERSTATES- AND IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD. YES WHERE THE SHORT ANSWER IS WE'RE STARTING TO BE A LONGER ANSWER IS WE JUST GOT FEDERAL GUIDANCE ABOUT A MONTH AGO OKAY AND WE'RE WORKING BANERJEE COMMISSION AND CALTRANS THE CALIFORNIA WILL SUBMIT A PLAN TO THE FED LATER THIS SUMMER BUT THE INTENT IS TO FOCUS ON THE OFFICE YORK FEEL CORRIDORS. THANK YOU AND- IN TERMS OF- THERE DESERVES REFERENCE ON PAGE SIXTEEN IN TERMS OF- SOME OF THE FUNDING- AT THE VERY TOP OF THE PAGE MIGHT BE PILOT PROJECTS. SOME OF THE FUNDING MIGHT BE FOR TRANSPORTATION EQUITY PROGRAMS- AND- ALSO- IT ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION EXETER. THIS IS A QUESTION OF FACT I THINK PROBABLY FOR A COMBINATION OF CARBONI ENERGY COMMISSION- AND ANYBODY ELSE IT MAY HAVE THAT BUT ON THE TEN FREEWAY NOW AS WE'RE GOING DOWN YOU KNOW WE SEE THAT MASS TRANSIT. EFFORT THERE WITH THE TROLLEY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE- IN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LANES. DO WE HAVE ANY ANALYSIS OF HOW WELL THAT IS WORKING- I'M- BUT I'M VERY COMMITTED AS MANY OF US ARE HERE TO TRYING TO IMPROVE PASSED TRANSIT. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS WE ACTUALLY YOU'RE MAKING AND THEN AND THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO WORK- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S CONCERNS ABOUT THAT AND IS THERE ANY ANALYSIS BEING DONE AS TO. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT AND WHAT ARE THE LESSONS LEARNED FOR US TO MAKE MASS TRANSIT- OTHER OUR OTHER MASS TRANSIT INVESTMENTS OF THIS ARE THERE AFFECTED. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE TROLLEY SPECIFICALLY ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW ASKED ABOUT THAT AND MATCHING CALTRANS ACOSTA MANAGEMENT SITES ON THE GENERAL POINT WE DO TRACK REALLY CLOSELY HOW THESE TRANSPORTATION VESTMENTS WORK IN PRACTICE SO YOU KNOW HOW DOES THAT CHANGE COMMITTEE BEHAVIOR AND WE SEE WHO'S EXCEPT FOR A- AND THAT IS THE FOCUS. OKAY THANK YOU. OF THE- L. A. O. IS BROUGHT UP THE CONCERN ABOUT- THE FOUR YEAR FUNDING- UP FRONT- TWO THINGS THAT- JUST LIKE TO PASS ON TO THE CHAIR HERE OF THE COMMITTEE I. I'VE SUPPORTIVE OF THE SUGGESTION THAT- AT LEAST TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SIX MILLION FOR LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS- SHOULD BE FOR TO FUND BATTERY REPLACEMENT- BECAUSE- I THINK THAT- MY EXPERIENCES SOME LOW INCOME PEOPLE ARE VERY ATTRACTED TO BUYING THESE CARS BECAUSE OF THEIR LOW OPERATION- AND IT'S THE BATTERY THAT. IS THE ONE THING IT BUT THEY CAN BY USED- ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND IF THEY CAN REPLACE THAT BATTERY SO I THINK THAT COULD BE A GREAT INVESTMENT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YEAH I'D LIKE IT IF I COULD JUST INNER JACKSON TO MENTION MY NAME- I AGREE WITH YOU AND AS THE OWNER OF A- TWO THOUSAND FOR. A PRIUS THAT JUST KEEPS ON ROLLING-I KNOW THAT IT A CERTAIN POINT- THAT BATTERY'S GONNA NEED TO BE REPLACED AND IT'S AN EXPENSIVE. A PROPOSITION FOR ANYONE BUT PARTICULARLY FOR A LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS YEAH GREAT THANK YOU- AND- THEN MY- OTHER QUICK QUESTIONS AS BEST AS I CAN MAKE THEM HERE- IS THERE WILL THERE BE A PART OF THE PROGRAM OUTSIDE OF WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WILL BE PART OF THE PROGRAM THAT WILL TRY TO GET THE OLDER MORE POLLUTING VEHICLES OFF OF THE ROAD- WITH OUR- WITH OUR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. A YES SIR SO MANY OF THE THAT LIKE THE VEHICLES YOU ARE SCRAPPING YOUR OLD VEHICLE IF YOU GET INTO AN EASY SO THAT HELPS DRIVE TURNOVER AND MANY OF OUR OTHER COMMUNITY PROGRAMS HAVE SIMILAR COMPONENTS THAT SCRAPPAGE REQUIREMENTS CAN VARY BY PROGRAM IS THAT I ALWAYS COMPONENT THAT OFTEN IS IN THE TRIED MAKE PASTA VESTMENTS BOTH THINKING ABOUT WAYS TO. HELP PLEASE TURN OVER AND HAVE PEOPLE AT STUFF THANK YOU AND I THINK THIS QUESTION JUST FOR CC- N. AND THAT IS UP UP TILL NOW WE'VE ALREADY ALLOCATED STATIONS COULD JUST WHAT IS THE CRITERIA THAT HAVE BEEN USED FOR CHOOSING THE LOCATION OF THE STATIONS BOTH THE HYDROGEN REFUELING STATIONS AND- THE ELECTRIC. CHARGING STATIONS- OF FOR THE ELECTRIC FEELING STATIONS WE OFTEN USE OUR AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN ANALYSIS PRIOR TO THAT WE USED A TOOL CALLED EVR CROW. CHU TARGET GAPS IN INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORK OKAY BUT WE ALSO WILL DESIGNED FOR PATIENTS THAT TARGET AREAS LIKE RURAL. OR ENTITIES AS WELL. ON THE HIDE ON THE HUNDRED SIDE- WE ALSO USE A LOT OF DATA AND ANALYSIS. WE ACTUALLY PARTNER WITH CARBON THEY HAVE A TOOL CALLED THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE TOOL WHICH IS A PRETTY NEAT ARCGIS MAPPING SYSTEM THAT SHOWS WHERE ALL THE TROUBLE. HUNDRED FIFTY THIRD. AND WE- THE ARE SPLIT. YOUR TARGET IN TWENTY FIFTH. WE ENCOURAGE THE- PROPOSED A THE COR MARKET AREA. LEADING FEELING UP THE STRUCTURE AND THEN OUR TWENTY NINETEEN BUT THE PATIENT WHO DID SOMETHING SIMILAR WE DONE FIVE ELIGIBLE AREAS WHERE APPLICANTS TO PROPOSED STATION LOCATIONS. THANK YOU OF A AND- PRETTY CLOSE TO FINISHED HERE- I HAVE- THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SUPPORT ELECTRIFICATION- I NOTICE- ON PAGE THIRTEEN THERE'S A REFERENCE TO- PORCH AND THERE'S NO FUNDING. DOLLARS IN THERE- UNDER THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO PACKAGE A SO ARE WE NOT COUNTING THE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS SUPPORT ELECTRIFICATION- AS PART OF- THE EFFORTS THAT WE PUT UNDER SUMMARY OF APPROVED AND PROPOSED A- OKAY THAT'S- THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S DESERVE PACKAGES SPECIFICALLY RIGHT OKAY I'VE NEVER NEVER MIND I'LL WITHDRAW THAT QUESTION. AND THEN FINALLY I DO HAVE- CONCERNS ABOUT TRYING TO EXPAND THE HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE- AND- THE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INTERSTATE QUARTERS THE FREIGHT QUARTERS- HAVE HYDROGEN SO THAT PEOPLE CAN BUY FOR EACH- AS THEY MOVE FORWARD- WITH THAT WITH THESE DECISIONS AND STUFF. AND SO- I JUST WANT TO. LET THE ENERGY COMMISSION NO I'VE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT- PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE WITH THOSE HYDROGEN WITH THE HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED THANK YOU CHAIR WANNA. THE QUESTION AND NOT AT ALL THE SOUND IN THIS ROOM- JUST APPEARS TO ME THAT YEAH I CAN'T I CAN'T COME WORSE- WITH EVERY SUCCESSIVE MEETING THAT WE HAVE YEAH I UNFORTUNATELY WHAT HAPPENED WITNESSES BACK IN THE BUILDING AND I THINK THAT I THINK THAT WOULD BE GREAT ADULT- IF WE NEED TO WE SHOULD MOVE TO ANOTHER. IF IT'S POSSIBLE I KNOW THAT THERE WERE JUGGLING SOME NEW- MEETING ROOMS MAYBE WE CAN MOVE THIS HEARING TO A DIFFERENT ROOM AND IF YOU ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HERE. THANK YOU MISS CHAIR SO. JUST A NOT AN ITEM DIRECTLY ON THE AGENDA THE JUST ON THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM I KNOW THAT WE DID THAT FUNDING OVER THE LAST- THAN LAST YEAR IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- AND OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. BUT MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THE INCOME GUIDELINES WERE CHANGED A COUPLE WEEKS AGO COULD SOMEONE FROM- ERR THEIR BOARD JUST KIND OF WALK US THROUGH WHAT THOSE CHANGES ARE WHAT THE THINKING WAS. YES MISTER CHAIR SO THESE ARE CHANGES THAT WERE VETTED IN THE FUNDING PLAN PROCESS OVER THE LAST YEAR IN APPROVEDBY THE BOARD IN NOVEMBER. AND THEY'RE KEY TO LIVING WITHIN OUR MEANS WITHIN CEDAR PT GIVEN THE THREE YEAR ALLOCATION TO IT. BUT THE BOARD APPROVED AND WHAT IS A FACE DOWN BASED UPON CONTINUED SUCCESS IN THE SALES SO AFTER THE MILLIONS HE WAS SOLD WHICH JUST HAPPENED- BEGINNING TO FACE DOWN BOTH- VEHICLE PRICES THE CAPS THREE OLD ONE PROGRAM. IN INCOME LEVELS AND SO IN ESSENCE THE PROGRAM GETS MORE FOCUSED ON SOMEWHAT LOWER PRICED VEHICLES AND SO MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LIFE OF THE FUNDING AND THOSE TRIGGERS YEAH BOARD APPROVED HAD BEGUN TO KICK IN WITH. THE RESULT THAT MILLION VEHICLE SALE. GOOD COULD YOU ARE US WERE THE INCOME IS AND NOW- WHAT THE- VEHICLE PRESS STAR. SHARE SO THE PHASE ONE CHANGE- TOOK- FOR SINGLE FILERS WHAT I BELIEVE IS A HUNDRED FIFTY K. GROSS ANNUAL INCOME CAP TO ONE THIRTY FIVE K. THE FOR HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD FOLKS IT WENT FROM I BELIEVE TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND TO ONE SEVENTY FIVE. JOINT FILERS THAT WENT TO I THINK TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. AND THIRTY CAP AND WENT TO A BELIEVE FORTY FIVE THOUSAND. DOLLARS FOR SMALLER VEHICLES THERE'S A FACE TO CHANGE WHICH WON'T TAKE EFFECT UNTIL FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE BOARD LEFT TIME FOR BOTH LEGISLATIVE FOR BOARD REVISITING THIS. NICENESS IS ALWAYS CHALLENGING. IS THAT THE ONE POINT TWO FIVE MILLION. EAGLE NOW THAT WOULD AND I BELIEVE. AND THEY'RE WITH ME ANY FIGURES. BRING THEM CAPTAIN AHEAD TWENTY CAT ONE TWENTY K. M. OR STANDARD FILERS FOR HAD HOUSEHOLDS AND BELIEVE IT GOES TO ONE SIXTY K. JOINT FOLLOWERS ONE EIGHTY FIVE- AND AT THAT POINT AGAIN HYBRIDS WILL COME OUT. AND REBATE AMOUNTS TO GO DOWN BY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS SO AGAIN THIS IS AN EFFORT. TO THINK ABOUT I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE BOARD WAS GOING WITH THIS AND THROUGH THE PUBLIC PROCESS OBVIOUSLY CONSIDERED A LOT OF FEEDBACK MANY DIFFERENT FOLKS. TO TRY TO FOCUS A LIMITED POOL OF FUNDS. ON SOMEWHAT LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS TO THE DEGREE THAT WE NEEDED TO MANAGE THAT AND THAT. IS IMPORTANT IN RELATION TO SOME BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT MAKE CLEAR THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS I'M NOT GETTING REQUIREMENTS AND FOR LOWER INCOME FOLKS. SO THAT'S WITH THINKING COMES FROM- IT'S ALL LAID OUT IN SOME DETAIL THE FUNDING PLAN. AND IT'S AN EFFORT AGAIN TO LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS WHILE MAKING THE PROGRAM FOCUSING AT- AND EFFECTIVE LANCE FOLKS WHO MAYBE HAVE SOMEWHAT LESS MEANS AS SALES INCREASED. GOT IT DID DID YOU- YOU MENTIONED YOU LOWER THE CAP ON THE. VEHICLE SO AS WELL. YES THAT'S RIGHT SO IT ENOUGH FIVE DOLLAR A BELIEVES THE CURRENT AND A SURPLUS. FOR THE SOME OF THE SMALL VEHICLES. I THINK ABSENT SIXTY K. FOR LARGER VEHICLES THAT ARE WORKING ON THAT ONE. I SEE OKAY. AND SO DO WE DO WE EVEN KNOW HOW MANY. VEHICLES ARE. THE QUITE A FEW I DON'T HAVE THE MODEL NUMBER FOR ME IN MY HAD- BUT I'LL CHECK THE STAFF ON THE- OKAY. AND THEN DO DO WE ARE. DO WE CONTINUE TO- A SUPPORT PLUG IN HYBRIDS AS WELL OR IS IT WE DO. HAVE A HYBRID TO COME OUT AFTER ONE POINT TWO FIVE MILLION IN THIS BORDER VISITS THAT POINT THAT PRESENT THEY REMAIN ELIGIBLE. IT WHAT'S WHAT'S THE LOGIC- FOR PLUG IN HYBRIDS. WELL I THINK THE THINKING HERE IS THAT AS WE MOVE INTO EVEN HIGHER SALES CLASSES PLUGINS BECOME LESS OF A LARGE CHUNK OF THE OVERALL. SALES FLEET SO WHEN WE LOOK FOR INSTANCE JUST PROJECTIONS WERE MANUFACTURERS ARE GOING. THAT REMAINS. TO THE POINT IS FOR SOME FOLKS BUT HE NEEDS BECOME MORE DOMINANT SO IF YOU GET A HIGHER SALES WE EXPECT TO BE THERE BE MORE IN THE MODELS. I WITHIN THAT PRICE CAPS SAID THREE CHOOSING ON EMISSIONS. MAKES MORE SENSE TO FOCUS ON. THESE YEAH BUT WHAT WHY EVEN HAVE A PLUG IN HYBRID ME SEEMS. WITH WITH. PASS GOT IT SORRY CONTRACT. LITTLE DOES QUESTION WHY WHY EVEN PLUG IN DOES SEEM TO BE- DOESN'T SEEM TO I DON'T KNOW WHY WE HAVE ANY INCENTIVE DOLLARS GOING TOWARD- ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO USE GAS. OP ED- IS AN EARLY STAGE MEASURE THIS LETTER MOVING AWAY FROM IT THIS MADE SOME SENSE DEPENDING ON THE STATE OF THE OVERALL CHARGING FRAMEWORK TO THINK FOR INSTANCE ABOUT PERFECT WELLER'S MIGHT HAVE LESS ACCESS TO IN HOME CHARGING THAT FLEXIBILITY CAN MATTER IN SOME USES ALL NOTE THAT COVERS REGULATORY WORK SAID THE BASKING CARE ACT YOU PACKAGE WE'RE MIGRATING STANDS YOUR PLUG IN HYBRIDS TO ESSENTIALLY MAKE THEM. MUCH MUCH CLOSER TO PURE EV'S SAY YOU USE THE GAS ENGINE PROBABLY REALLY SPECIALIST USES A LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES SO CERTIFIED ANSWER ONE. TWENTY TO MAKE THOSE CARS BETTER PERIOD THE TWO THERE ARE SOME USERS THINK APART WHETHER IT'S THINK OF FOLKS RURAL COMMUNITIES AND LIKE YOU MAY HAVE LESS ACCESS YOU STILL GET THE BENEFITS IT AND SO DO WE DID YOU INCREASE THE MILE- REQUIREMENT FOR BUT THE BATTERY SIZE BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOME PLUG IN HYBRIDS WITH PRETTY SMALL BATTERS. SO THAT WILL THAT SUPPOSED TO BE DONE IN THE NEXT PASSING CARS TO PACKAGE I'M REGULARLY. SO LEFT THE WHOLE FLOOR. A SORRY CAN I. SO IT'S ALWAYS AREYOUR THANK. YOU CARDS STAFF. WE AT ITS NEXT ROUND OF. RACE WHICH INCLUDE. NEW RAISE STANDARDS PLUG IN HIGH. TO GROW THAT ISSUE. SO THE ANSWER IS NO. AT YEAH IN THE IN THE C. A. R. P. THAT'S AN IMMEDIATE FOLK THAT'S THEY ARE WILL FALL OUT SHORT THE SALES INCREASED. AND I BELIEVE THAT WE RAISED RANGE CAPS FOR PLUG IN HYBRIDS TO GO AFTER THE REALLY LOW ONCE IN THE PAST YEARS SAID WE HAVE MADE SOME EFFORTS THERE. YEAH BUT I GUESS- BEAT UP TO MAKE THIS POINT FOR YEARS I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE- REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO TO BUY CARS. AND THEY WERE STILL SUBSIDIZING GAS CARS BOARD A PROJECT FEEDBACK. YEP YOU'VE TAKEN THE FEEDBACK FOR NUMBER YEARS AND DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT. YEAH I GUESS THE BIG CHANGE IS THAT WE ARE DROPPING THE FROM THE PROGRAM AT WITHIN ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR THE VEHICLES AND THAT WAS WHERE THE BOARD LANDED AT SO THEY HAVE TAKEN SOME ACTION. BUT OBVIOUSLY IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS AND FOCUS AND PERHAPS EVEN TAKE QUICKER ACTION THE CURRENT PROCESS FRAME OF THE FUNDING PLAN. IS TO TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS THE BOY WILL NEXT YEAR BECAUSE OF THIS FOR THE END OF THE YEAR. I GOT ON THE DARTMOUTH WAS RECEIVED YOU'RE YOU'RE COMING THROUGH KIND OF GARBLED SO SORRY. BUT I WAS SAYING WAS AND BOY DID DROP THEM FROM THE PROGRAM. AND ITS SALES CAPS COLLAPSED I THINK IT'S AGAIN AT ONE POINT TWO FIVE MILLION VEHICLES THE PLUGINS WILL BE OUT. SO THEY DID HEAR THAT AND THAT WAS THE CHOICE THEY MADE I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT. I'M WHEN THEY NEXT VISIT THIS TOWARD THE END OF THIS YEAR AND- IF NOT MAY EITHER BE A SELF PROBLEM GIVEN INCREASING SALES. OR A SEEM TO BE SELF PROBLEM I'M GETTING THAT FEEDBACK AND GIVEN THEIR CALL IN DECEMBER OKAY GREAT THANK YOU- I JUST. WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THE EQUITABLE AT HOME. CHARGING INCENTIVES- WHAT'S WHAT'S THE HOW HOW WAS THAT GOING TO BE STRUCTURE IN ITALY- SUPPORT INCENTIVIZING- MULTI FAMILY. DWELLINGS FOR CHARGING AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BUT JUST CURIOUS WHAT WHAT YOUR- WHAT THE. THINKING WAS BECAUSE JUST LOOKING AT THE- NUMBER STATIONS YOU WERE LOOKING. AND AT THEM. DIDN'T SEEM LIKE WE WERE GETTING VERY MANY STATIONS FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO THE PROGRAM. YES SIR AND PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF MY IDEA OF NOT COMING THROUGH CLEARLY- THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION. NEITHER OF YOUR AUDIENCE COMING THROUGH VERY CLEARLY- I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN I AGAIN I APOLOGIZE- SO THE OUT OF HOME EQUITABLE CHARGING THREE HUNDRED MILLION TOTAL. AND HOW TO SEGMENT WITHIN IT THERE'S A MULTI UNIT DWELLING APARTMENT AND CONDO SEGMENT PHILOSTRATUS PURPOSES WE'RE THINKING TWO HUNDRED MILLION. OF THAT THREE HUNDRED MILLION WILL GO TO DOT BAGMAN. AND FOR THAT ONE WE EXPECT TO GET TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND LEVEL TWO CHARGERS. ASSEMBLY TWO THOUSAND LOCATIONS FOR THAT. ON THE SINGLE FAMILY HOME INFRASTRUCTURE WERE ALLOTTED PURPOSES WERE MODELING OUT ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION OTHER THREE HUNDRED MILLION WILL GO THERE LOOKING BY ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND FIVE ZERO LEVEL TWO CHARGERS. I WANT TO NOTE THAT ON THE SINGLE FAMILY HOME THAT MEANT THAT WILL BE EXCLUSIVELY FOR PRIORITY COMMUNITY W. LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WE ACTUALLY RAN THROUGH ANALYSIS IN A REPORT WE PUBLISHED EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT SHOW THAT WHILE PEOPLE FAMILY HOME THAT HAVE THE GREATEST ACCESS. TO CHARGING THERE'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY BIG DELTA FOR THOSE IN THE LOWEST INCOME SEGMENT. UNDER FIFTY THOUSAND AND WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE INVESTMENT THAT TAKES THAT NUMBER- ON MY ONE FROM THE SOUTH I BELIEVE FROM 25% ACCESS FOR THAT GROUP UP 240% ACT THE FLAG GROUP. JUST GIVE ME VERY TARGETED. YEAH THAT'LL THAT'LL- THOSE PROGRAMS CARP IT HAS KICKER. FOR TWO CHARGER THROUGH ANOTHER. AS WELL AS LOCAL MISTER FOR ME. HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE EITHER LOW OR LIVE IN A DIFFERENT COMMUNITY SO REALLY NEED A HIGH NEED IN THAT SEGMENT WHILE GRADES SO I TOTALLY SUPPORT THE MISSION BEHIND BOTH PROGRAMS ONE FOR MULTI FAMILY AS WELL AS FOR. SINGLE FAMILY BUT A TYPICAL LEVEL CHIU CHARGER TO INSTALL IS ABUT A THOUSAND OR MAYBE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO. CHOOSE THE PRICE FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS- FOR THAT MATH TWENTY EIGHT. THOUSAND LEVEL TWO CHARGER SHOULD ONLY COST ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS SO I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE UT WHAT THE OTHER. HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION OR WHAT THE HUNDRED THE. OTHER HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE DOLLARS GOING TOWARDS. GREAT QUESTION- SO ON THE FINANCIAL AND WORKS COPING. EXCUSE ME FOR INTERRUPTING BUT MAY I ASK YOU TO TURN YOUR VIDEO OFTEN IT MAY HELP BECAUSE THAT THERE'S A CLEAR LACK OF SYNC BETWEEN. THE VISUAL AND THE- AND THE AUDIO. THANK YOU FOR AND AGAIN I APOLOGIZE FOR THA IS IT IS IT BETTER. WELL WE'LL SEE. WE'LL JUST USE OUR AIR. THEIR DAUGHTERS AND I. OKAY I'LL DO MY BEST TO GO A LITTLE BIT SLOWER ON THE SINGLE FAMILY HOME LEVEL TWO CHARGER BURST OPEN THAT OUT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR INSTALLATION AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE YOU KNOW APPROXIMATELY FOUR TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE L. TWO CHARTER BUT THEN ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED TOWARD PAEL UPGRADE ADDING A CIRCUIT OR DOING OTHER THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN. ON THE MULTI FAMILY HOME. AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS IS ALSO A LEVEL TWO CHARGER FOR COPING OUT ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CHARGE REPORT. AND WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THIS. IS A LOT OF THE CLOCK IS ACTUALLY NOT THE CHARGER ITSELF. IT WILL WORK IN THE ENGINEERING TO HAVE TO GO AROUND IT. EVERY FOOTPRINT EVERY SITE IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THEY'RE ALL IN ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION PROJECT. THE OFTENTIMES THINGS LIKE SHRINKING LAND ON CONDUIT AND WIRE PANEL UPGRADE POSSIBLY OTHER THINGS. ARE REALLY THE BULK OF THE COT. AND THAT THE BIGGEST DRAW BECAUSE- ISRAEL LENT. THE TRENCH TO BE DONE SO DEPENDING ON WHAT THE POWER SOURCES. AND WHERE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS CAN HAVE A STRONG IMPACT TO THE COST OF THAT. INTERESTINGLY WHILE COOLEY TWO THOUSAND FOR A LEVEL TWO CHARGER ALL AND IN SINGLE FAMILY HOME WHERE THINK IT'S MORE LIKE SEVEN THOUSAND PER LEVEL TWO CHARGER. IN AND YOUR DATE. AT THE FOR THE MULTI FAMILY UNIT DWELLINGS I GUESS WOULDN'T WIN TO GET SOME. LEVEL OF SCALE BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT DOING ALL THAT WORK AND JUST PUTTING ONE OR TWO CHART YOU'RE PUTTING IN A NUMBER OF CHARGERS- SO WOULDN'T THAT PRICE. COME DOWN BELOW. SEVEN THOUSAND THAT SEEMS FAIRLY DOES BUT THAT DOESN'T FACTOR IN THAT ECONOMY OF SCALE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO DO A TRANSFER ONE CHARGER SOMEWHERE YOU WOULD DO IT FRIENDS TO TEN OR FIFTEEN OR TWENTY CHARTER BUT YOU STILL HAVE THAT FIXED BECAUSE OF THE TRANSUNION CONDUIT. AND LAYING DOWN THE WIRE. OKAY EVEN EVEN WITH YOUR MATH I'M ONLY GETTING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. I PULLED UP SO. ONE HELLO MY CALCULATOR OUT TO SEVENTY THOUSAND TIMES TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND CHARGERS. I COULD I COULD BEGIN MY MATH WRONG BUT- NOW I CONFIRM THE EARLIER ON YOU HAVE ME WORRIED THAT I GOT IT WRONG BUT LET ME. I THINK YOU JUST TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND I THINK IF YOU GO. I CAME TO. SORRY SIR I CAN TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION OKAY SEVEN THOUSAND I'M JOHN TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND CHARACTERS OKAY. SO- I WOULD JUST MAKE SURE YOU. REVIEW THE SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CHARTER. COST TO LEE AND I WILL NOTE WE ALWAYS TRY TO SCALE THAT DOWN THAT THE PUBLIC PORTION OF THE INVESTMENT IS NOT EVEN THE ALL AND THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR WOULD WOULD PICK UP AND WE ALWAYS WANT TO REDUCE OUR SHARE OF IT- BUT YEAH 100% CORRECT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE CAR DOWN ON THE PUBLIC SHARE. AND YOU DO YOU CONTINUE TO BE A STUBBORN DOCUMENT. OKAY THANK YOU- AND THEN JUST GO BACK TO AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE ALREADY ASKED ABOUT SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE GENERAL FUND FOR EMERGENCY OPPORTUNITIES- WHITE WHY ARE YOU ASKING FOR THREE YEARS FOR THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION. AND DOES IT DOESN'T COME WITH A LOT OF DEFINITION AS TO WHAT THIS- PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE DOING. UNAFRAID TO DO FOR THAT OVERALL DESIGN IT CAN STEP IN ON ANYTHING ON PROGRAM THANK YOU WHICH IS THE GENERAL FUND FOR EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES THAT ONE A- AT THE BOND- A MULTI YEAR I THINK. I'LL GET OVER. A CARPET YOU TALK ABOUT THE DETAILS OF WHAT THAT PROGRAM IS. KIND OF THE OVERALL LIKE NORMAL YEAR STRATEGY REALLY WHAT WARNING. DURING THIS RECENT COMMITMENT- TOWARD MEETING OUR CLIMATE TRANSPORTATION GOALS AND ONE LARGE PART REALLY TRYING TO. SEND A GOOD SIGNAL THE DRIVE MORE PRIVATE SECTOR COMPETITION. AND THE BY HAVING BUTTE MULTIAIR BET THAT WORK WORK AND MORE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT- AND THEN HOW TO TURN OVER TO CARPET. WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD BE FUNDED WITHIN THAT- MERGING. OPPORTUNITY COMPONENT. SECOND SPEAK TO THIS AND JERRY RIGHT IT'S PROBABLY. THE THINKING. IS INTENSE. SO WE'VE HAD PRETTY GOOD SUCCESS EACH YEAR PUTTING OUT. I AM LOOKING SCALE REQUEST FOR EDUCATION AND EXPERIMENTATION IN HARD TO REACH SECONDS I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. AND SINCE THEN EMAIL LOCOMOTIVES YOU WANT GETTING SIXTEEN SWITCHERS ONLINE THEY'RE ONE OF THESE GRANTS OR IN A SOMEWHAT PARALLEL PROCESS AND I JUST DOWN THERE YESTERDAY IN WILMINGTON. AND WE FIND IT THAT REALLY USEFUL EXTERNAL PROJECT THAT BROUGHT IN TEN FUEL CELL TRUCKS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME AT COMMERCIAL SCALE AND STATIONS THAT HELP PEOPLE LEARN. TO THE GOAL HERE IS IN THE SENATE- TO REACH SEGMENTS WHETHER ITS LOCOMOTIVES MARINE WHERE WE FOR INSTANCE HAVE RECENTLY. HELPED COMMERCIALIZE YOU KNOW DOWN THE SEA CHANGE THE FIRST. IN THE FIRING OF THE BANK. ISRAEL INTEREST IN A BROAD HOT CAN HELP FOLKS GET IT LOGICAL. IN ALL THESE AREAS SO THAT AND IN EACH CASE THIS ISN'T JUST SPIT BALLING WHAT ONE DOES IS PUTS OUT OF THE HOUSE MORE DEFINED FELICITATION TO FIND THE PUBLIC PROCESS AIMED AT. THE PARTICULAR AREAS THAT WE NOW NEED ENGINEERING ADVANCEMENTS. IN THE EARLIER QUESTIONS WE NEED TO LEARN ABOUT LOGISTICS AND WITH THE EXPERIENCE AND TRIED. DRIVING GOOD- PRESENCE THERE AND THAT'S DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF THESE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE MORE FOCUSED EITHER EQUITY OR AT SCALE. THIS IS A CHANCE FOR THE STATE TO DO WE ACTUALLY QUITE SUCCESSFUL AT WHICH IS GREAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARN FROM THEM SO THAT IS THE THINKING AROUND IT UP NOW I FOUND EDUCATION WANTS TO SPEAK IN THAT SEGMENT ABOUT. THANK YOU I THOUGHT YOU COVER THAT WELL THANK. SO I GUESS THE ONLY QUESTION IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU NEED A THREE YEAR RUN WAIVERS IS JUST COMING BACK EVERY SINGLE YEAR. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE BUT IT'S A- WHITE SWAFFORD DEMONSTRATION PILOT PROJECTS. WHEN DO I FIND ITS THINKING ON THAT THEY WILL SAY AS A PRACTICAL MATTER I'M NEEDS MOST OF THESE PROJECTS HAVE BOTH PURPOSE BUILT AND REQUIRE A FAIR AMOUNT OF LOGISTICAL SUPPORT DESIGN SEVEN CLARITY ON SEVEN OVERALL RUNAWAY. THEIR CASH YOU REALLY HELP GET THIS ALL THE WAY DOWN AND MAKE SURE FOLKS WERE ALL THE WAY THROUGH PLANNING AND PERMITTING PROCESSES AND INCENTIVES FOR THE MORE INNOVATIVE PIECES DESIGNED PROPERTIES SEVEN HEAVY DUTY SPACE ESPECIALLY FAT FOLKS YOU KNOW THERE AND BUILDING NEAR THE TRACKS IN VERY DIRE WE DO HAVE A LOT MORE PURPOSE BUILT COMPONENT SAYS ONE REASON WHY HAVING THIS OUT THERE MORE IS VALUABLE BUT I'M LIKE AND I DEFERRED THE MATURATION OF PARTICULAR- CHOICES OKAY GREAT WELL PERHAPS- ON THE ON THE ON THE NATURAL DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE TO. HAVE YOUR THREE YEAR FUNDING STREAM FOR PILOT PROJECTS OR DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS BUT- IF YOU COULD AT LEAST PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF PAST PROJECTS. TO THE STAFF WE COULD WE COULD TAKE A LOOK AT IT. SHOW THAT- JUST GO BACK TO- CREE- THE CLEAN VIA SYSTEM PROGRAM CLEAN CAR FOR ALL% THAT'S HOW THAT'S BEEN GOING. YEAH IT'S GONE I THINK REALLY WELL AND CONTINUES TO EXPAND SO IF GO THROUGH WHERE DANN AND COUPLE OF OR IT'S GOING SO I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY WHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU. IT IS A REALLY SEVERE LAG IN IN THIS IN THE DELAY THERE'S A DELAY I NEED YOU TO SLOW DOWN LIKE HALF GO HALF THE SPEED BECAUSE- IT'S JUGGLING ALL OF YOUR WORDS TOGETHER AND I'M ALL I COURSE OR ANYTHING YOU'RE SAYING. THEY MIGHT HAVE. HELLO GRADING THAT THE CREATIVITY OF THE HELP. LET'S TRY TURNING OFF YOUR- THANK YOU. THAT COULD HELP HER- I'M GETTING SOME ODD NUMBERS THAT WITH THIS RESTORATION. LET ME KNOW IF THIS HELPS AND THE PLEASE INTERACTIVE IT DOESN'T SO. I'M ON THE FINANCING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ABILITY TO DATE WITH ALLOCATED. ABOUT SIXTY SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS TO THAT'S ABOUT JUST SHY OF FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED. VEHICLES WHICH HAS BEEN QUITE POSITIVE. ON CLEAN CARS FOR ALL THINGS AT ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLARS SO FAR ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED VEHICLES ON EVERTEC- AND WORKING TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM. OVERALL TO JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF A BIGGER PICTURE COMCAST FONG METICULOUSLY OBVIOUSLY ROLLED OUT. IN SPECIFIC VENUES RATHER THAN- STATEWIDE AND ONE OF THE HOPES FOR THIS BUDGET PACKAGES TO. AND BEGIN TAKING THAT INTO IT A STATE WIDE. ON PROGRAM WHICH I THINK WOULD BE QUITE USEFUL SO THAT SEVEN. OF WHICH KIND OF HAVE A HAPPY DAY GET IT ANY PARTICULAR PIECES OF IT. DO YOU DID YOU GET A SO OR NOT ENOUGH TRACK. PEOPLE WERE NEW ARE YOU CARS. TO THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL. YOU KNOW I'M I BELIEVE IT'S PRIMARILY THE TRAFFICKERS FELLOWSHIP MISSTEP AND THAT FOR ANY PARTICULAR BREAKDOWNS. I'M SORRY. IT'S PRIMARILY WHAT DO. COULD YOU SAY WITH WHAT WE'VE SEEN BOTH REASON PEOPLE BUY NEW AND I THINK THIS EXCITEMENT THERE WE'VE ALSO SEEN USED VEHICLE PURCHASES AND THAT'S TRUE IN BOTH OF THE PROGRAMS I DO NOT HAVE IN MY HAD A PARTICULAR BREAKDOWN IN A FIFTY FIFTY OR SIXTY FORTY ON IT BUT I CAN CHECK AND- THE OTHER WAS A CURE SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE ARE. LOW INCOME JUST WONDER HOW THEY CAN AFFORD NEW CARS. YEAH AND OBVIOUSLY SOME FOLKS CAN'T ESPECIALLY THESE PROGRAMS BUT I THINK THE USED VEHICLE MARKETS A REALLY BIG DEAL AND I WAS NOTE PARENTHETICALLY. THAT ON THE REGULATORY SIDE A LOT OF WHAT CARDS DOING ITS NEXT ROUND OF RAGS IS MAKING SURE THAT NEW CAR STATE DURABLE THINKING INDICATE THINGS LIKE BATTERY LIFE TO CONSUMERS. SO TRYING TO MAKE SURE THE USED VEHICLE MARKET FOR HE'S- ON HIS BOTH GROWING AND RELIABLE IN ADDITION TO THE INCENTIVE PIECES. GOT GOT ENDED FOR THE CLEAN VEHICLE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM YOU MENTIONED THE SIXTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION. AND HOW MAY IT WHAT THAT RESULTED IN TERMS OF- I THINK I'VE MISSED WHAT YOU SAID BERMAN NUMBER VEHICLES. ONLY A PROBLEM IS PERMANENT AND THAT AGAIN THAT WAS ABOUT I THINK. TO PLAY IN THIS BIG A LITTLE BIT OF PROCESS SINCE EIGHTEEN. THAT I'VE THOU SEVEN AND NINETEEN AND MINOR. OKAY MADE IT TO TWENTY BUT NOW. OKAY AND THAT AND NOT THE JUST JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY- BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ALL THE DETAILS FOR THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM IN FRONT OF ME- THERE ARE. IS IT JUST BECAUSE THE THERE'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DELTA BETWEEN THOSE TWO PROGRAMS IS JUST THE STRUCTURE OF THE INCENTIVE. WHAT SMALLER DOLLAR AMOUNTS RIGHT- SO JUST ENTER TO SAVE TOTAL ALLOCATION SO I THINK THAT PROBABLY A LOT OF THAT. THE SMALLER DOLLAR AMOUNTS FOR THE CLEAN CARS WELL YEAH I MEAN ALLOCATED FINANCING ASSISTANCE HAD JUST SHY OF SIXTY EIGHT MILLION. CONTRAST BROADHEAD AROUND A HUNDRED NINETY ONE MILLION ALLOCATED TO IT THAT'S PROBABLY MOSTLY DRIVING THAT I'M SORRY SUGGESTED HUNDRED NIGHT. AT NINETY ONE MILLION OKAY GOT YEAH ONE NINETY ONE SO THAT'S ONE ONE GOT IT THAT MAKES SENSE THAT MAKES MORE SENSE. YEAH OKAY- GREAT I WOULD JUST SAY OVERALL I THINK YOU KNOW I'M I'M HAVING LIKE A LONGER RUNWAY- HAVING SOME. A GREATER CERTAINTY FOR THESE PROGRAMS BY THAT WE DO WANT TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT SOME OF THESE- LIONS LIKE A **** ABOUT THE EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES TRADITIONALLY UNDERSTAND- FOR THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN EXISTING I THINK IT DOES MAKE SOME SENSE. OF SOME OF THESE NEWER PROGRAMS NOT SURE IF IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO DO A THREE YEAR- FUNDING CYCLE- FOR SOME OF THESE NEWER PROGRAMS BUT DO APPRECIATE- A VERY AGGRESSIVE PACKAGE ON ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND REALLY PUSHING PUSHING THE ENVELOPE SO THAT WE CAN TRANSITION. OUT OF OUT OF- ALSO FEEL TRANSPORTATION SO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO WE HAVE A MISTER SMITH FOLLOWED BY MISS FRIEDMAN AND MISTER BENNETT WITH FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN- THE FOR THE PUBLIC GIVEN ON CLOUD NINE SINCE MONDAY SO CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN FOR THE GREAT CHILD HOPEFULLY GET TO SEE HIM RESEARCH I'M NOT PLANNING ON COMING DOWN ANYTIME SOON I. BUT MARK THE BACK END OF YOUR CHEER ME FOR BEING LATE BUT I'M BACK INTO THE TRANSPARENCY OR ACCOUNTABILITY. AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE TRACKING THESE PROJECTS AS WE MOVE ALONG- DO WE GET AN UPDATE NEXT YEAR THAT. WE EXPENDED X. AMOUNT OF DOLLARS OR BILLION DOLLARS. WERE IN CONSTRUCTION ON SO MANY WE HAVE SO MANY COMPLETED. BUT IN IN THAT ISSUE. WILL WE GET AN UPDATE. CERTAINLY WE'RE ALWAYS HAPPY THAT THAT YOU'LL- THAT WAS EASY SO WE WILL GET AN UPDATE IN EARLY MARCH OF NEXT YEAR WHERE WE'RE STANDING WITH ALL THIS OF MONEY THAT'S BEEN EXPANDED. YEAH WE'RE ALWAYS HAPPY TO COME BACK AND BE CLEAR ON WHERE THINGS STAND AS INDIA. THE THING MY OTHER COLLEAGUES ARE CONCERNED WITH IN I'LL GET WITH THE ER BUT THESE PROJECTS. WE STARK CONSTRUCTION IT MIGHT TAKE A YEAR BEFORE THEY GET FINISHED IN THIS PROJECT I KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH IT. WE DID A PROJECT ON MONDAY FOR A COLLEGE. TO ABOVE FORTY I ARDOR WROTE RELIEVE THAT SITUATION- MAYBE WE CAN HELP YOU OUT ON CERTAIN PROJECTS TO GO THAT. IN ANOTHER. PART WITH THE FUELING STATION YOU PULL IN YOU GET GAS AND FIVE MINUTES AND YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY. THE FEELINGS. THE LACTIC FILLING STATION. YOU HAVE TO STAY THIRTY MINUTES TO TWO HOURS THE FOOTPRINTS GOING TO BE ABOUT FIVE TIMES LARGER THAN THE EXISTING. SHIP YOU KNOW DOUBLE GO GAS STATION. ARE WE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION. THIS GREATER SIZE THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE ON WHEN YOU PUT IN THESE CHARGING STATIONS. GOOD MORNING- I'LL TAKE THAT QUESTION. SO IT VARIES QUITE A BIT DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF CHARGING STATION- THE LEVEL TWO YOU DON'T HAVE TO THAT ABOUT THE CURRENTBUT TO YOUR POINT THOSE YOU TAKE LONGER TO CHARGE. THEY'RE GREAT FOR A LONG LONG TIME LOCATION BLAKE. WORKPLACES THE HOME IT'S A REALLY UNDER THAT MODEL YOU'RE NEVER REALLY BE THINKING ABOUT HAVING TO CHARGE IT IT'S ALWAYS HARD FOR YOU. BUT THE DC FAST CHARGERS AND HOT IN THE HYDROGEN STATION. CANNOT HAVE A LARGER FOOTPRINT- IF THEY'RE MOVING MORE AND MORE TOWARD. THE RIGHT WAY TO GET THOSE DEPLOYED QUICKLY WE KNOW PERMITTING AND INTERCONNECTION YOUR PROBLEM. AND WE ARE LOOKING TO GET HIGHER POWERED PAST CARTER'S OUT THERE WHICH GET YOU CLOSER TO A FIVE TO TEN MINUTE CHARGE. AS OPPOSED TO A TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY MINUTES HARD. TO DEFINITELY- APPRECIATE THAT CONCERN. AND WE'RE TRYING TO TALK ABOUT IT WHILE. THEM WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO SO. WHILE WE'RE CHARGING VEHICLE. TO GET A LIKE A REST AREA ALONG THE- HI FIVE NINETY NINE. OR WE CAN WALK AROUND HAVE ACTIVITY SOMETHING TO DO WHILE YOU MAY BE ABLE TO BE IN CHARGE. AND THEN AND- PART OF THE PROJECT HERE SAYS NE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. FOR CALLING SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION WE'RE NOT TAKING ANY FUNDING FROM THE EDUCATION THIS IS ADDING TO THAT. I THANK YOU CAN COUPON WITH THE LEAD GENERALISTS OFFICE SO THIS IS FUNDING THAT WOULD BE PAID WITH IN THE EXISTING- PART OF FUNDS SET ASIDE FOR OUR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WE WOULD NOTE THAT THAT FUNDING IS ONLY AVAILABLE FOR ONE TIME ACTIVITIES SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT COULD BE REDIRECTED TO. OUR ON GOING IN COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS OR OTHER ON GOING PURPOSES FOR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THEN A FOLLOW UP. IN SCHOOLS FOR THE RESIDENTIAL CHARGING STATION IS THERE GONNA BE. IF WE BUY A BUS DO I MAKE COORDINATED TO BE IN THE CHARGING STATION. SO WE GET THEM BOTH COORDINATED I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A BUS WITHOUT CHARGING OR CHARGING WITHOUT A BUS. OR TRANSPORTATION VEHICLE FOR ALL OUR TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES. RIGHT SO THE WAY THE PROGRAM IS SET UP AS THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES THAT IS THAT WOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH BUS. WITH THE IDEA THAT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND WOULD PAY FOR THE BUS ITSELF. AND FIFTY THOUSAND WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR THE CHARGING STATION BOTH COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM WOULD BE ADMINISTERED. BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO IT WOULD BE ONE GRANT PROGRAM TO PAY FOR BOTH. PIECES OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR THOSE QUESTIONS MISS FRIEDMAN THANKS I HAVE A QUESTION- ACTUALLY PROBABLY TO QUESTIONS ABOUT FLEET INCENTIVES. THE FIRST IS IF YOU CAN JUST OUTLINED WHAT'S AVAILABLE. FOR SMALLER FLEETS OF WHO WANT TO CONVERT. DESERVES AND SECONDLY WHY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INCENTIVES GIVEN TO LARGE FLEETS AND THOSE GIVEN TO SMALL FLEETS. AND HOW ARE YOU LOOKING AT. FUELING TYPES AND VEHICLE TYPE WITH FLEET INCENTIVES. FIRST LET ME START OUT ON THIS AND- THERE'S LESS COMPLEX TO THIS SO WE CAN GO BACK AND FORTH IS NEEDED. SO GENERALLY SPEAKING- SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS PLEASE CAN ACCESS- FUNDING INCLUDING THIRD WITH MY PROGRAM WHICH IS OUTSIDE OF THIS HEARING AND THEN R. H. V. I.P. PROGRAM. AND MEDIA. YEAH FUNDS BOTH FUEL CELL. AND BATTERY TRUCKS. GENERALLY SPEAKING THE INCENTIVES ARE ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER TRACK FOR BATTERY VEHICLES INVOLVED IN A FIFTY THOUSAND PER GRADE STRUCK. IT'S ABOUT DOUBLE THAT FUEL CELLS JUST REFLECTS THE TOTAL SCOPE. ON THE DIFFERENCE ON COST BASE WITH WHEELS OR TRACKS COST MORE AS WE TRY TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENTIAL TO SOME DEGREE FOR FLEETS. YOU CAN ACCESS THIS- BASICALLY THROUGH THOSE VOUCHER PROGRAMS WHICH THE BOARD DECIDED IN NOVEMBER I'M TO FOCUS STEADILY MORE HEAVILY. ON SMALL FLEETS. IN TERMS OF OVERALL ACCESSIBILITY. AND THE GOAL HERE THE THINKING. IS THAT WE KNOW THEY'RE A LOT OF FOLKS WHETHER IT'S OUR SMALL BUSINESSES OR SMALL MINORITY OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE REALLY FOCUSED. ON THE TRANSITION BUT MERRY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE SMART IN TERMS OF WHERE WE ALLOCATE THIS CAPITAL. AN INMATE AT FOLKS WHO WE KNOW DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO BROADER CAPITAL POOLS FOR THE WEEKEND. THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ALL RIGHT- MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU AND AGAIN THAT NUMBER QUESTIONS AND- IF YOU CAN BE AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE ANSWERED APPRECIATED- ALL MY QUESTIONS HERE DEAL WITH AB EIGHT THE- DIRECTION TO BUILD TWO HUNDRED HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS AN UNDER ABA CAN YOU TELL ME HOW MANY HAVE BEEN BUILT SO FAR. YES THIS ENERGY COMMISSION AGAIN SO AB EIGHT DIRECTION AT THE HUNDRED STATIONS AND ON THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THREE HUNDRED STATIONS AND WE'RE CERTAINLY MARKING TOWARD THAT TWO HUNDRED STATION MARC. WE HAVE FIFTY FIVE OPEN STATIONS NOW. THIRTY THREE STATION IN DEVELOPMENT I WILL HAVE A HUNDRED STATION DONE BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE- WITH THE GENERAL FUND MONEY WE GOT LAST YEAR WILL BE ABLE TO GET TO R. TWO HUNDRED MARK BY ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY TWENTY SIX. K. AND CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THE TIMETABLE IS BETWEEN WHEN WE- AWARD MONEY FOR OF A STATION AND WHEN THE STATIONS ACTUALLY BUILT AND. AND OPEN FOR- BUSINESS. YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION- IT COULD VERY QUITE A BIT BUT WE'RE AVERAGING ABOUT TWO YEARS. AND WE ARE EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF SIMPLY GETTING ADEQUATE AMOUNTS OF HYDROGEN TO THOSE STATIONS- HAVE YOU SEEN ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THAT EQUATION- IN THE IN THE RECENT MONTHS. SOME GOOD ANNOUNCEMENT THAT PRODUCTION IS INCREASING AND- ON THE ENERGY COMMISSION SIDE OR INVESTMENTS HAVE ALSO BEEN GOING TOWARD FUEL PRODUCTION. WE AWARDED THREE MORE FUNDING GRANT EARLIER THIS YEAR FOR CLEAN AND RENEWABLE FUEL PRODUCTION. AND THEN HOW MANY OF THE STATIONS THAT WE HAVE OF THAT THE OF THE SIXTY FIVE THAT HAVE GONE IN SO FAR HOW MANY OF CONSERVE BOTH MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY AS WELL AS LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES. DON'T HAVE A NUMBER FOR WHAT ALREADY BEEN DEPLOYED BUT BETWEEN WHAT THE DEPLOYED AND WHAT WE'VE ALREADY FUNDED WHICH IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT WILL HAVE THIRTEEN ONE THREE SECOND ALSO THIRD MEDIUM DUTY HEAVY DUTY. I'LL NOTE THAT WE'RE GOING TO LAUNCH OF PETITIONS- THIS YEAR AS WELL TO ENCOURAGE THE MARKET TO DO THOSE THAT ARE DUAL PURPOSE. LIGHT DUTY PASSENGER WITH MEDIUM DUTY HEAVY DUTY SO WELL OVER A CENTURY YOU BROUGHT UP THE DUAL PURPOSE- HOW WHAT'S THE TECHNOLOGY THERE HOW HOW EASY IS IT IS IT THE SAME NOZZLE OR DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DIFFERENT NOZZLE BETWEEN HEAVY DUTY AND- AND LIGHT DUTY. OF CAN WE YOU KNOW LIKE THE DIESEL IT USED TO BE ABLE TO. PULL UP WITH YOUR CAR AND THEN YOU YOU COULD GET DIESEL OF YOU KNOW WHAT. TO AT THE TRUCK STOP CAN YOU OF. IN LIGHT NATIONAL BIT INTO OF HOW COMPATIBLE WILL HEAVY DUTY AND LIGHT DUTY. HYDROGEN FUELING BE THAT SO LET ME GET BACK TO YOU ALL KNOW THAT THE ONE WHO DECLINE NOW TYPICALLY HAVE TWO SIDES TO IT BUT THERE MAY BE A FAN LINE OR SOMETHING WHERE A TRANSIT AGENCY ACCESS AND IT ON ITS SIDE. OF THE FENCE LINE WITH A CONSUMER FACING FIVE ON THE OTHER I DON'T KNOW IF THE NOVELS ARE INTERCHANGEABLE BUT A LOT OF THAT POOR INFRASTRUCTURE MORE THAN THIRTY ABOUT LET ME FIND OUT ABOUT THE NOVELTY. SO THE BUT THE CORE INFRASTRUCTURE SO GENERALLY COULD WE COULD WE HAVE ALL OF THEM- IN THE FUTURE BE ABLE TO SERVICE BOTH. MEDIUM AND HEAVY AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. AND LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES AT THE SAME TIME. HERE RADICALLY I THINK YES- MY ONLY COPY OUT IF WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ITS THIRD THAT PLEASE OFFICIALLY FOR THEIR OPERATION. AND STILL HAS A GOOD CONSUMER EXPERIENCE FOR THE CONSUMER NOT. TRYING TO DODGE- CAN'T ABOUT THE- GREAT STRUCTURE I THINK THEORETICALLY YEAH BUT WE WANT TO THINK THROUGH SOME OF THE PACIFIC. SO IF WE WERE ON THE INTERSTATE WE ARE AT A BIG TRUCK STOP WE COULD MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THOSE AT THAT TO ALL THE HYDROGEN STATIONS PUT AT A- AT A- AT A LARGE TRUCK STOP WHERE THERE'S- THERE'S- A- LARGE AMOUNT OF SQUARE FOOTAGE OF DEVOTED TO- FUELING- IN THOSE SITUATIONS WE COULD CERTAINLY. HAVE THOSE ALL BE DUAL- DO PURPOSE. HYDROGEN STATIONS CORRECT. I BELIEVE THAT'S THE CASE BUT LET ME CONFIRM I DON'T WANNA GIVE YOU WRONG INFORMATION BUT I BELIEVE THAT IS CORRECT I'LL GET BACK TO YOUR OFFICE OR NOT THANK YOU- AND THEN- JUMPING DOWN TO THE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE MILLION THE FEDERAL FUNDS RESERVE INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE WILL SEE THIS WELL THAT FUNDING BE AVAILABLE FOR SOME OF THESE HYDROGEN STATIONS ALSO ON THE INTERSTATE THAT'S OVER AND ABOVE THE TWO HUNDRED- THAT- WE NOW HAVE AS A GOAL FROM THE GOVERNOR THE FEDERAL FUNDING HAS TWO COMPONENTS. THE SECTION YOU'RE TALKING TO IT FROM THE FIVE BILLION TOTAL. CALIFORNIA GETS THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY FOUR MILLION. ON THAT HAVE TO BE FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES. THANK YOU ALTHOUGH THERE THE TWO POINT FIVE BILLION COMPETITIVE. WHICH COULD GO TO LECTOR KERR HYDROGEN. WE DON'T HAVE FEDERAL GUIDANCE ON THAT YET BUT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO BRING THAT CALIFORNIA TO. OKAY THANK YOU ALMOST FINISHED YOUR FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SUPPORT ELECTRIFICATION- AS- AS I'VE BEEN TALKING TO PORT OF HUENEME REPRESENT- THEY ARE OF REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES. OF THE PLANNING AND EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING TO TAKE TO ELECTRIFY AND A PARTICULAR CONCERNED ABOUT ENOUGH ENERGY COMING. FROM THE GRID AT ANALYZING THAT WITH THAT WITH THE I. O. SEASON SO WILL SOME OF THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION BE AVAILABLE. SO THAT THE PORTS CAN COORDINATE WITH THE I. O. USED TO ENSURE THE PROPER PLANNING- OF BRINGING IN THE ELECTRICITY PROPER PLACEMENT OF THE EQUIPMENT EXCEPT FOR. WORDS ARE GOING TO BE DEVOTED ONLY TO THE EQUIPMENT ITSELF. UNDER THAT THE ATTACK THE QUESTION ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE- WE CAN ALSO FUND UP PLANNING BLUEPRINT GRANT WE'VE DONE THAT IN THE PAST. THE CANDIDATE AND HIS MOTHER SO WE COULD ACTUALLY FIND PLANNING BLUEPRINT FOR THE FUNDING OF WHILE- I JUST GOT A TEXT FROM MY COLLEAGUES YOU CAN FEEL. HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES WITH A LIGHT DUTY NOVEL IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT SLOWER. GREAT SHOW CAN BE DONE EXCELLENT- AND SO IT AND IT'S STILL UNANSWERED SO PLANNING FOR INTEGRATION- AND GRID UTILIZATION WILL BE. A ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE PORTS CAN USE A FOREIGNER MILLION DOLLARS FOR. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE CAR BESIDE BUT YET ON THE ON THE ENERGY COMMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE WE COULD FIND- THE- GREAT THE CARD AND I CAN SPEAK FOR THE CURBSIDE IN ABSOLUTELY SO WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT THE EXACT PARAMETERS OF THIS PROJECT THE PUBLIC PROCESS BUT WE'VE HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP TWENTY ME. WE KNOW IN GENERAL THAT FOR ALL THE COURTS THEY NEED TO THINK ABOUT THESE IMMIGRATION ISSUES AND I HAVE A HARD TIME THINKING AND- THE ANY PUBLIC PROCESS WOULDN'T TURN OUT A CLEAR NEED TO THINK ABOUT PLANNING INTEGRATION GIVEN THEIR NEEDS. GREAT THANK YOU UP JUST ONE AND WITH THE WITH TWO COMMENTS AND ONE IS THAT- AS WE'RELOOKING AT THE HYDROGEN ELECTRIC FEELINGS DID YOU RECHARGING AND SORT OF THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE OUT THERE. THEY'RE REALLY JUST BOTH OF THEM HAVEUNIQUE ADVANTAGES TO- YOU KNOW- WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE ELECTRICITY IN THEIR HOMES I CAN PLUG THEIR CARS IN THEIR HOMES THEY DON'T HAVE HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS AT HOME. ON THE OTHER HAND- AS- MY COLLEAGUE POINTED OUT THAT. JUST IMAGINE THE BACKLOG ON HEAVY TRAVEL DAYS HELLO. THIS THANKSGIVING THE WEDNESDAY IN THE SUNDAY OF THANKSGIVING WEEKEND AND EVERYBODY TRYING TO CHARGE THEIR VEHICLES AT A AT- CHARGING STATIONS ON THE INTERSTATES YOU KNOW AS ARE DRIVING GO EAT IT. IT IN BUT HYDROGEN COULD BE TREATED JUST LIKE GASOLINE YOU COULD HVE MANY HYDROGEN TANKS YOU HAVE LOTS OF PEOPLE COME IN FUEL UP IN IN FIVE MINUTES. SO I'M COMPLETELY SUPPORTIVE OF BOTH OF THESE I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE OR SOME GREAT VALUE TO HAVING BOTH OF THEM AVAILABLE. TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS THAT ARE OUT THERE- AND WITH WITH THE HYDROGEN I THINK THERE THERE'S MORE FLEXIBILITY IN MANY WAYS- WITH ELECTRIC BATTERIES THERE IS TO IT. YOU CAN HAVE- DATE TO CHARGING TAKING PLACE IN IN IN PEOPLE'S HOMES- AND SO I JUST HOPE THAT WE THAT WE WILL BE TRULY BE COMMITTED. TO TRYING TO MAKE BOTH OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES I'M UNLESS SORT OF SAYING I'M I'M TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AND MORE SAYING I'M PRO MAKING SURE WE HAVE AT LEAST TWO AVENUES GOING FORWARD- IF NOT MORE AS. BETTER TECHNOLOGY COMES COMES FORWARD AND THEN FINALLY AB WE HAD A SHORT COME. ARE PART THE INTEREST BY BOTH OF US IN AND- TEN MILLION I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN MUCH MORE THAN TEN MILLION. FOR THE BATTERY REPLACEMENT ONLY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S SO MUCH BETTER OF AN INVESTMENT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE COST OF BUYING A IT- ARE BUILDING A WHOLE NEW VEHICLE AND ALL THE CARBON. ADMISSION THAT GOES OUT THERE AND DIS ALECTRA VEHICLE SEEM TO BE HOLDING UP REALLY WELL OUTSIDE OF THE BATTERY SO. HOW TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE COULD BE MORE THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE- YOU'RE- A STRONG. INTEREST IN AND COMMITMENT OF THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER BENNETT WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUE TOO. THAT'S THE- TWENTY TWENTY TO CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN- OF TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION. IT'S A TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST. FOR COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION INCENTIVES. DO WE HAVE FOR A. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME- IF YOU COULD SPEAK UP A LITTLE BIT IT SOUNDS LIKE BECAUSE OF I MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT LONGER. SISTEMAS FLETCHER THIS IS MISS FLETCHER OKAY I CAN SPEAK UP WITH THAT BETTER MUCH BETTER THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT AND I WILL GIVE AN IDEA OF WHAT I SAW I WILL KEEP- MY CAMERA OFF SO WE DON'T HAVE THAT. THAT DISTORTED VIDEO. THANK YOU UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THAT'LL BE HELPFUL- AND WE'LL TRY TO IMPROVE- AT OUR NEXT HEARING WHERE I'M HOPING WE'LL BE ABLE TO- HAVE THE- IN PERSON PANELISTS AS OPPOSED TO- REMOTE. SO UP- I WELCOME PLACE PLEASE BEGIN AS FLETCHER. ALL RIGHT WELL GOOD MORNING SHOULD MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SHOULD NOT FLETCHER I MET DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT OUR PROPOSAL ON THE COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM. SO BEFORE I START I WANTED TO NOTE THAT NEARLY ONE THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS PREDOMINANTLY PEOPLE OF COLOR LIVE THE OVER FOUR HUNDRED CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY SUFFER FROM DIRTY AIR. SO IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE CALIFORNIANS THAT LIVE IN A COMMUNITY THAT SUFFERS FROM DIRTY AIR ON AVERAGE YOU WILL BREATHE AIR THAT HAS TWICE THE AMOUNT OF CANCER CAUSING DIESEL PARTICULATES AND SOMEONE THAT LIVES IN A MORE FLUID COMMUNITY. WITH CLEANER AIR SO THIS BURDEN ON WHO SUFFERS FROM DIRTY AIR AND WHO DOESN'T IT DIRECTLY. I GOOD YOUR OF IT NOT WHAT IT WAS WHEN YOU BURKE YEAH WE'VE HEARD THAT IT DIFFICULT ABOUT- AND I'M NOT SURE ABOUT YOUR AND ARMENIA THIS. BIT MORE. LIKE YOU WERE. OF OKAY IS THAT BETTER. ALL RIGHT. I TURNED. UP ON MY- RIGHT SO ALL JUST I'LL START RIGHT HERE- INSTEAD BUT I'M- SO THIS BURDEN ON WHOSE FOR DIRTY AND DOES. IT'S A DIRECT OF THE LAW HISTORY OF RACE SPECIFIC AND RACISM CONCENTRATED POVERTY AND YEARS OF HISTORIC DISINVESTMENT AND I COLLECT IN THESE COMMUNITIES. TO ADDRESS THIS DISPARITY. THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED ASSEMBLY BILL SIX ONE SEVEN WHICH DIRECTED CARBON IN CONJUNCTION WITH LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS TO PARTNER WITH PRESIDENT OF HEAVILY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AND FOLLOW THEIR GUIDANCE TO ADDRESS LOCAL CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANT AND TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT SOURCES OF CONCERN TO A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES. THREE WHICH I WILL DISCUSS TODAY. SO THE FIRST CHART A G. IF THE COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION OR CAP INCENTIVES WHICH FOCUSES ON ADDRESSING CONCERNS FROM THE COMMUNITY THAT CONTINUES TO SUFFER FROM DISPROPORTIONATE CUMULATIVE EXPOSURE BURDENS IN THE CREATION OF YOUR MONITORING PLANS. AN EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS. THESE COMMUNITIES ARE SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN AB SIX ONE SEVEN. THE OUTCOME FROM THE CAPTAIN CENTERS ARE REAL SUPPORTERS HAMPEL WE'VE SEEN. OVER TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED ENGINES REPLACED WITH CLEANER ALTERNATIVES STATEWIDE. AND SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS INCLUDING OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND TONS OF OXIDES OF NITROGEN JUST KNOCKS A HUNDRED TONS OF REACTIVE ORGANIC GASES IN SEVEN HUNDRED TONS OF PARTICULATE MATTER OR PM. SO THIS B. C. P. REQUEST A HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION IN INCENTIVES TO CONTINUE THIS IMPORTANT WORK. THE SECOND STRATEGY REQUIRED BY EIGHTY SIX ONE SEVEN ITS PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS. FIFTIETH P. ALSO FIFTY NINE INTO TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY. FOR AIR DOES IMPLEMENTATION. TO CONVENE COORDINATE AND SUPPORT COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEES WITH THIS AUTOMATION STIPENDS LANGUAGE ACCESS AND MEETING MATERIALS. DEVELOPED AIR MONITORING PLANS AND EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS WITH THE COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEES. EMPLOYEE MAINTAIN THEIR MONITORING WITHIN COMMUNITIES. AIRPORT CRITERIA TOXIC AREAS CAN CONTAMINATE REPORTING AND IMPLEMENT BEST AVAILABLE RETROFIT CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES THAT SPARKED REQUIREMENTS. THE THIRD STRATEGY OUR COMMUNITY AIRCRAFTS WHICH ONE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND CALIFORNIA TRIBES THESE GRANTS HELP AUTHORITIES DEEPEN THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE EIGHTY SIX ONE SEVEN PROCESS AS WELL AS BILL CAPACITY TO ACTIVELY IDENTIFY EVALUATE AND ULTIMATELY REDUCE AIR POLLUTION AND EXPOSURE TO HARMFUL EMISSIONS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. IN THIS B. C. P. REQUEST TEN MILLION TO CONTINUE THOSE EFFORTS. NUMBER OF YOUR- EXACTLY AT THE END OF YOUR PRESENTATION THAT IS THE AND THEN THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WEHAVE A QUESTION FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- I NOTICED IN YOUR BUDGET- THERE'S TEN MILLION ALLOCATED- FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CAPACITY BUILDING GRANTS. ARE FOR YOU KNOW COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHERS. TO SUPPORT THEIR PARTICIPATION IN AB SIX ONE SEVEN- WHERE WILL YOU. TARGET ARE DO HAVE TARGETED COMMUNITIES OR HOW WILL THESE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVE. OF THIS INFORMATION THAT THERE'S FUNDING FOR THEM FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND SO WHILE OUR EIGHTY SIX ONE SEVEN PROGRAM- WE DO YOU HAVE SELECTED AB SIX ONE SEVEN COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S WHAT WE TALK ABOUT THE STEERING COMMITTEE FOR THE COMMITTEE THE AIRCRAFT'S PROGRAM IT IS STATEWIDE. AND SO WHAT WE DO IS WE WORK CLOSELY WITH- ART DEPARTMENTS WITHIN CARP AND WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES TO SHARE OUT THAT INFORMATION AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S REALLY GETTING ACROSS ALL OF I THINK- THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND THE TRIBES SO THEY ALL HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. WE HAVE TEN MILLION AND SO ONCE WE KIND O SHARE THAT INFORMATION AGAIN WE'RE WORKING WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES WORKING WITH A TRIBAL LIAISONS AND WE'RE WORKING WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT KIND OUT INFORMATION- THAT'S KIND OF HOW WE DO IT BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REALLY GET THIS RESOURCE OUT TO AS MANY COMMUNITIES. AS POSSIBLE GIVEN AGAIN I THINK THE AMOUNT OF COMMITTEES ARE. SUFFERING WITH AIR POLLUTION. S. R. I. I. GREW UP IN COMMUNITY I REPRESENT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM AIR POLLUTION WHERE CHILDREN. I HAVE TO GO HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL RIGHT BY SEVERAL FREEWAYS AND SUFFER FROM ASTHMA YOU KNOW THE- ASTHMA RATES- IT FOR CHILDREN IN MY COMMUNITY ARE VERY HIGH BECAUSE OF. THE PLAYGROUNDS ARE RIGHT. UP NEXT TO THE INTERSTATE FREEWAYS SO AT YOU KNOW LOTS OF COMMUNITIES WE WANT. TO IMPROVE THEIR AIR QUALITY AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR. YOU TO DO THIS OUTRAGE- THEY WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS. BUT I'VE ALSO HEARD FROM AT LEAST. SOME AIR DISTRICTS INCLUDING SOUTH COAST. ON THAT- YOU KNOW THIS PROGRAM IS. THERE MAKE POTENTIALLY DON'T WANT TO ACCEPT MORE COMMUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN. AB SIX ONE SEVEN- BECAUSE OF FUNDING OR THE ROUTE THEY SAY THEY'RE LOSING STAFF- BECAUSE OF THIS PROGRAM- WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT OR WHAT ARE YOU DOING- TO SUPPORT THEIR DISTRICTS. TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM AND POTENTIALLY ACCEPT MORE COMMUNITIES INTO THIS PROGRAM. I AM SO GLAD THAT YOU ASKED THIS QUESTION- I DEFINITELY THINK WE HAVE BEEN A CONVERSATION WITH SOUTH COAST I'M HONESTLY ALL OF THE- DISTRICTS REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE BASS TO SUPPORT THE COMMUNITIES AND SUPPORT THEIR DISTRICTS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM- I WOULD CALL OUT THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT A PROGRAM RESET TO THINK ABOUT OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN DO THIS WORK OUTSIDE OF THAT CURRENT MODEL AND SO PART OF WHAT I THINK FOR US IS SO IMPORTANT ABOUT. FIFTY P. THINK HE COMING IN FRONT OF ALL OF YOU TO DATE IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW CAN WE LOOK AT AND LEVERAGE OTHER MODELS I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT GRANTS PREVIOUSLY AND THINKING THROUGH CAN WE USE THOSE AS WAYS TO REALLY HELP AND I THINK A POWER COMMUNITIES AND ALSO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN EXPAND. AND RESET THIS PROGRAM TO LIKE THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE CAN ACCESS WITH OTHER PLACES SO WE ARE MOST KIND OF ARMOR CASE CALM CONVERSATIONS WE AREN'T ADDRESSING NOT WITH THEIR DISTRICTS AND KIND OF A GUY HAD REALLY COLLABORATING WITH THEM TO THINK ABOUT WHAT MAKES SENSE. HOW DO WE USE THESE PLANS AND THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT TO COMMUNITIES AND ALSO BECAUSE YOU POINTED OUT SO THAT COMMUNITIES ARE ACTUALLY RECEIVING THESE FUNDS IN pCOMING OUT FOR THEM. BECAUSE IN AND OUR NOTES HE IT SAYS- IMPERIAL. REVOKED AN APPLICATION DUE TO LACK. OF IMPLEMENTATION FUNDING- AND SO. I DON'T KNOW. YOU DON'T. WHAT WHAT THE FUND YOU KNOW IF THEY DON'T WHY THEY DON'T FEEL THEY HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING IS THAT SOMETHING WE CAN ADDRESS. OR WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THE PROCURE PROPOSE FUNDING HERE FOR THIS PROGRAM. I WILL BE COMPLETELY CANDID AND THIS IS WHERE I WISHED YOU WERE IN PERSON SO THAT YOU CAN SEE MY THINGS WHEN I SAY THIS- YES. THERE'S A REFERENCE FOR THIS IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH THIS I'VE YOU KNOW I'VE I DO I JUST HAVE CONCERNS THAT AS WE WORK TO INCREASE THIS LIKE YOU SAID THERE'S MANY COMMUNITIES ACROSS. THE STATE RIGHT THAT MAY WANT TO PARTICIPATE- IN THESE AIR QUALITY PROGRAMS BUT ARE YOU KNOW AS FAR AIR DISTRICTS ARE DENYING THESE APPLICATIONS OUT FOR DISCOURAGING- COMMUNITIES TO APPLY- YOU KNOW THAT'S THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE. IN THAT WHAT ARE WE DOING- TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING TO THEIR DISTRICTS NEED MORE RESOURCES- OR JUST. YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMUNITIES THAT. WANT TO PARTICIPATE ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. WHO- I WILL IN I TURNING ON MY CAMERA AND TRY TO SPEAK S. AS POSSIBLE. THE LEGISLATURE THANKS THE AMOUNT FOR THE AIR DISTRICTS- IF THERE IS A CONVERSATION TO INCREASE THAT AMOUNT AND THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL YOU ARE RATE THAT IMPERIAL- WE TOOK A PAUSE ON THAT APPLICATION- I'M A PART OF IT IS RESOURCE AND- I THINK THE SAME CHALLENGES SOUTH COAST HAS ALSO PROBABLY BROUGHT UP I MEAN. WE'RE MORE AND MORE COMMUNITIES ARE WANTING TO BE SIX ONE SEVEN COMMUNITIES AND QUITE FRANKLY FUNDING IS FLAT. SO YOU WILL HEAR ASKING YOU FOR IT AND IF I'M JUST BEING. AND TRYING TO TALK SLOWLY. WE ARE ASKING YOU FOR THE SAME AMOUNT AND YET WE ARE THINKING IF ANYTHING- COMMUNITIES THERE'S OVER FORTY COMMUNITIES THAT WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT'S AN R. P. THINK IT'S EXTREMELY SLOW BECAUSE OF THAT SO. IF THERE CAN BE A CONVERSATION AROUND AN INCREASE OF RESOURCES WE WOULD GREATLY WELCOME IT BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE ARE THINKING ABOUT RESETTING THIS PROGRAM AND ARE HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH BOTH THE COMMUNITIES AND THE AIR DISTRICT. IT DOESN'T NEGATE THE POINT THAT WE HAVE FAR MORE COMMUNITIES AND WE ACTUALLY DO RESOURCES TO DO THIS IMPORTANT TYPE OF WORK. OKAY I'M INTERESTED IN HAVING THAT CONVERSATION AND I HOPE THAT THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE OR- YOU KNOW. ONE ON ONE OF WE CAN HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU. IT LET ME HAVE MY VOICE TO THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE- THE- THIS FUNDING AT A HIGHER LEVEL OF THIS IS A SUCCESSFUL. PROGRAM AND- I GREW UP THE AS A YOUNG CHILD TO AND EARLY ADOLESCENT AND A COMMUNITY THAT WAS HEAVILY. AFFECTED BY AIR POLLUTION THE- IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY- AND I REMEMBER- SUMMERS- A WHERE WE WERE HAVING TO CUT BACK ON OUR ACTIVITIES- WHERE YOU COULD FEEL THE POLLUTION IN YOUR IN YOUR- CHEST TO. THE EARLY OF SYMPTOMS OF- WHAT GOD- COULD BECOME ASTHMA IN LATER YEARS- THIS IS AN AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN WITH US FOR DECADES NOW. AND WE- HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITH SOME- AIR POLLUTANTS AND UNSUCCESSFUL WITH OTHERS. A WE NEED TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS IN THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS- THAT ARE. HELPFUL IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT MOST NEED. A HELP THEM AND SO I STRONGLY SUPPORT ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO- INCREASES FUNDING IN- THEREBY INCREASE THE RELIEF- AT A NOMINAL LEVEL ROWLEY- BUT SOME RELIEF THE COMMUNITY SAID- CAN RECEIVE. THE- THANK YOU FOR YOUR- OF YOUR PRESENTATION IT STRIKES ME THAT- WE- WENT TO QUESTIONS EARLY DIDN'T LIKE. WE ACT NOT HEARD FROM- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- OR MISTER BROWN HAS BEEN. PATIENTLY WAITING. CAN WE CAN WE HAVE THAT TESTIMONY TO HELP QUESTIONS AND THEN WE'LL GET TO MISTER BENNETT SORRY TO HOLD YOU UP. YES SERGIO ACCURATE DEPARTMENT BY IT- IT JUST KIND OF GIVE GIVE US A COUPLE COMMENTS OUT. OF THE FUNDING JUST KIND OF YOU KNOW THE REMINDERS OKAY- NOW. DID THEY BECOME TEAM PROGRAM I HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY FUNDED OUT OF. B. YOUR DISCRETIONARY PORTION OF THE YEAR AT THE CAP AND TRADE FUNDING. AND REALLY KIND OF ON AN ANNUAL BASIS DEPENDING ON ON THE LEVEL OF. REVENUE THAT ARE TOO THAT THEY DID YOU KNOW WORKING. WITH THE LEGISLATURE ULTIMATELY. DETERMINE WHAT GETS PRIORITIZED THAT FUNDED WITHIN THAT BUT THERE ARE YOU KNOW ANNUAL CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF MONEY THAT. WE HAVE TO BE COMING INTO THE FINANCIAL THAT DOES CHANGE. THE ANNUAL. UP WITH A FUNDING. THE ONE POINT THAT I THINK WOULD BE A- ON. BLACK YEAR AS THEY WERE. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE OUT BY ACT IT INCLUDED BASICALLY TO. OR OF CAP AND TRADE FUNDING. FOR THE- PORTION AND TRADE PLAN THAT WOULD. ADOPTED FOR TWENTY TWENTY. AND VOTE THAT MONEY BASICALLY ALL ROLLED OVER. AND THERE WERE LARGER INVESTMENT BECAUSE THERE WAS MORE MONEY AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL TWO YEARS WORTH OF DISCRETIONARY REVENUE AND AT. SO THAT'S WHY NOW WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE PEOPLE YEAR WORTH OF REVENUE SO THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OLDER. LOWER OVERALL AMOUNT I WHICH WHICH YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THE CHANGE FROM LAST YEAR TO THIS YEAR. THE REFLECTION OF. THIS YEAR THE ONE YEAR AMOUNT VERSUS LAST YEAR WHAT THE TWO YEAR ABOUT BUDGET THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THAT CLARIFYING- JUST MADE. I JUST GATHER OTHER POINT I'LL MAKE TO IT WHEN IT COMES THE DISCRETIONARY- WORKING. AT THIS YEAR WE HAVE TO DO A LOWER. INCOME EARNERS BUDGET A LOWER AMOUNT TODAY WE'VE SEEN IN PREVIOUS YEARS- PARTIALLY BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE THINGS NOW THAT COME OFF THE TOP. AS A RESULT- THANK YOU VERY CHANGES WHERE IT HURTS- IN PROGRAMS THAT AT FOUR WEEKS. YEAH INTO A FUNDING AMPLE THAT MEANS THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY AVAILABLE THE ROOM OF THE- AFTER THAT JUST NOT ANOTHER- ACT THERE BY. ANY LAUGHING ON IF. WE ARE OR WILL. LOOK AT THE- YOU KNOW LATER- CABINETRY ARE TO. WHAT NO REVENUE. WILL BE ABLE TO COUNT OR THE MAY REVISION ENERGY. COMING OVER IN THE MAY REVISION WITH WITH AN UPDATED OUTSIDE OF REVENUE THAT. BEAT IT- EXPENDITURES TO ACCOUNT FOR ANY THAT WE THOUGHT THIS LAST OPTION WILL BE A OF MAY REPAIRS. AND REVIEW VALUE. AT THE WITHOUT A OKAY GOOD NIGHT THE MONEY. THANK THANK YOU HAVE A FOR THAT AND- I KNOW IT SAID. BUT THIS IS A PLACE WHERE WE MIGHT TO COME SOME CHEN FUND DAHLE SO I'LL JUST THROW THE OUT THERE- AND- THE BROWN. LMAO ARE YOU OF A YES YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON BROWN WITH L. A. L. I'M GONNA KEEP MY CAMERA- GIVEN SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WE'VE YOU BEFORE BUT- WE JUST WANTED TO. WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC COMMENT ON KIND OF THE SPENDING ITEM OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN OF COURSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS- CONSISTENTLY FUNDED OUT OF ITS- ARE UP- CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN OVER THE YEARS. WE WANTED TO JUST PROVIDE SOME VERY BRIEF COMMENTS ON THE GDR UP REVENUE PICTURE- AND THE SHORT STORY IS THAT- REVENUE IS TRACKING ABOVE THE ADMINISTRATION'S ASSUMPTIONS THAT WERE BUILT INTO THE JANUARY BUDGETS. AND WE DO THINK THAT REVENUE IS LIKELY TO BE HIGHER THAN THE ADMINISTRATION'S ASSUMPTIONS- OF COURSE AS THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHERE THERE'S A- LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND CAP AND TRADE REVENUE AND THERE'S VERY GOOD REASON TO BE CAUTIOUS AND TAKING A CAUTIOUS BUDGETING APPROACH. HOWEVER EVEN WITH THAT SAID WE DO THINK THAT THERE WILL LIKELY BE YOU KNOW SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MORE AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING THAT KIND OF CONDITIONS. REMAIN THE WAY THEY ARE- AND OF COURSE- WE WILL UPDATE THE LEGISLATURE LATER THIS SPRING IS MORE INFORMATION ON KIND OF MARKET CONDITIONS. BECOMES AVAILABLE AND THE MADE RESULT RESULTS FROM THE MAY AUCTION ALSO BECOME AVAILABLE SO. NOT ONLY IN MY COMMENTS THANK YOU- THANK YOU UP- MISTER BENNETT NEIER THE ONLY- MEMBERS ARE STILL ON THE DICE HERE BUT WE ARE. QUIETLY CELEBRATING GOOD- THAT ADDITIONAL- GIUGIARO OF THAT WE HOPE WILL BE HER. JUST BITE MY QUESTION WAS GOING TO ASK ABOUT THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE CUTS IN AND I REALIZE IT'S BECAUSE OF- AS THE G. G. R. F. FUNDING. AND I WOULD TO. SUGGESTED OVERALL ON BUT PROGRAMS LIKE THIS THAT WE SHOULDN'T TIE- THESE PROGRAMS TWO. VARIABLE FUNDING LIKE WE GET FROM THE CAP AND TRADE OF SALE- BY A PROGRAM THAT THEY'VE IS FREE AFTER VIEW THESE THINGS AND I KNOW- THAT'S BEEN REFERRED TO THAT IT'S WE'VE DISCOURAGES GENERAL FUND- FROM BEING INVOLVED IN THIS BUT- I THINK THAT THIS IS APPROPRIATE PARTICULARLY IN TIMES OF SURPLUS LIKE WE HAVE. RIGHT NOW- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AND- WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE. THAT IS A CENTRALIZING AND EXPANDING COMMUNITY MONITORING AND TO BELIEVE WE HAVE- I ET CHIANG THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE A RP. TO PRESENT ON THAT. I DO I'M GONNA TURN ON MY CAMERA JUST NOW TO SAY HELLO I EXIST AND I'M GOING TO TURN IT OFF JUST TO MAKE. IT EASIER. OKAY WE HAVEN'T SEEN YOU YET. HELLO HI OKAY HERE ALL RIGHT. SINCE THE STATE'S OKAY THANK YOU SO GOOD MORNING KAREN AND MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE MY NAY IS EDIE AND I'M HERE PRESENT PROPOSAL TO EXPAND COMMUNITY AIR MONITORING. KARPUS REQUESTING THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDS TO HIRE CONTRACTORS TO USE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY AND MOBILE MONITORING APPROACHES TO DETERMINE AIR POLLUTION IMPACTS IN COMMUNITIES STATEWIDE WITH A FOCUS ON AIR TOXICS. AIR TOXICS POSE A THREAT TO COMMUNITIES AND THIS POLLUTION MAY NOT BE MEASURED BY THE EXISTING FIXED MONITORING STATIONS THAT WE AND THE AIR DISTRICTS CURRENTLY OPERATE. MOBILE ONITORING CAN PROVIDE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DATA COVERING MORE COMMUNITIES WHICH MAY ENABLE FURTHER INSIGHT INTO REMAINING SOURCES AND AIR TOXICS AND LEAD TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE STEPS THAT ARE NEEDED TO REDUCE THESE BURDENS. THIS WOULD BE A LIMITED TERM CONTRACT OVER TWO YEARS DURING WHICH THE CONTRACTORS WOULD ENGAGE IN OUTRAGE WITH COMMUNITIES TO BE MONITORED. CONDUCTS APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF MONITORING. AND THEN HELP COMMUNITIES UNDERSTAND AND INTERPRET THE RESULTING DATA. THE DATA WOULD ALSO BE INTEGRATED INTO EIGHTEEN VIEW WHICH IS CARDS PORTAL FOR AIR MONITORING DATA. THIS PROPOSAL AUGMENTS THE EIGHTY SIX ONE SEVEN COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM THAT WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT MY INCLUDING COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS THE STATE RATHER THAN ONLY THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN AB SIX ONE SEVEN. THIS WILL HELP INCREASE UNDERSTANDING OF COMMUNITY EXPOSURE. HELP IDENTIFY POTENTIAL SOURCES SENATE TAKE FOCUSED COMMUNITY AN AGENCY ACTION AND HELP PRIORITIZE LOCATIONS FOR AN ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMUNITY SCALE POLLUTION MONITORING IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU AND I CAN HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DO WE HAVE- ANY- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REPORT FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. DR DRIVE OUR PARTY FINANCING ADDITIONAL COMMENTS THAT BUT HAPPY TO HELP WITH ANY QUESTIONS RIGHT THANK YOU AND TO ALEJO. ROSS BROWN AGAIN WITH THE L. A. O. SO THIS IS THE THIRTY MILLION IS REALLY THE ONLY OF NEW PROGRAM THAT'S PART OF THIS YEAR'S. PROPOSALS PART OF THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN- IN CONCEPTS WE DO THINK THAT EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THAT BOTH THE SCOPE AND QUALITY OF AIR QUALITY MONITORING SETUP MERIT AS THERE ARE SOME GAPS IN THE EXISTING AIR QUALITY MONITORING NETWORKS NETWORKS- PARTICULARLY AT THE NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL. HOWEVER BASED ON OUR INITIAL REVIEW IT'S UNCLEAR WHY THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MONITORING APPROACH AND RAISES A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR US SO AS THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS THIS PROPOSAL IN WAYS THAT AGAINST OTHER SPENDING PRIORITIES. SOME QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER INDIRECT ADMINISTRATION TO REPORT ON INCLUDE. WHY IS. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED TO STOP A NEW MONITORING APPROACH INSTEAD OF EXPANDING EXISTING MONITORING EFFORTS SUCH AS THE EFFORTS THROUGH AB SIX SEVENTEEN WHICH YOU JUST DISCUSSED. WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE TO USING MOBILE MONITORING COMPARED TO OTHER TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS STATIONARY MONITORS THAT CAN MEASURE POLLUTION AT A SPECIFIC LOCATION TIME **** SNAPSHOT OF AIR POLLUTION RATHER THAN IN A SYSTEM THAT CAN HELP. THE STATE TRACK CHANGES IN AIR POLLUTION OVER TIME- I WILL THE FUNDING BE USED TO INFORM FUTURE AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES SO FOR EXAMPLE. WHAT THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS COLLECTED FROM THE SEPARATE HOW WILL THAT INFORMATION BE USED TO INFORM FUTURE REGULATORY OR SPENDING DECISIONS. AND THEN FINALLY- THIS IS A ONE TIME KIND OF ALLOCATION AS PROPOSED BUT- AND A GOOD QUESTION FOR US AS WELL THE STATE HAVE ANY ONGOING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH. UNDERTAKING THIS EFFORT- KIND OF ONCE THE RESULTS THAT THE INITIAL RESULTS ARE. ARE ARE IN INTO THE KIND OF CREATE AN EXPECTATION OF KIND OF AN ONGOING EFFORT. SO WE THINK ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE QUESTIONS REALLY COULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE OF VALUE WAIT THE OVERALL MERITS OF THE PROPOSAL. WITHOUT THAT ADDITIONAL DETAIL- WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER REDIRECTING THIS FUNDING TO OTHER EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT ARE HIGH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES SO. AND THAT COMMENTS THANKS. THANK YOU MISTER BROWN- MISS JANGANLAH ME ASK YOU- A FOLLOW UP TO THE QUESTIONS THAT- THE ALEJO- WAS POSING- WHY WHAT WHY WOULD WE WANT TO INVEST THIS MONEY AT THAT IS THAT'S IN A PROGRAM. THAT IS ESSENTIALLY A ONE TIME SNAPSHOT AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING-THAT IS MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND SYSTEMATIC THAT ATTRACTS CHANGES IN AIR POLLUTION OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. SO IN THIS PROGRAM WOULD ALLOW ITS TO GET KIND OF THIS BASS. FOR EMISSIONS IN COMMUNITIES AROUND THE ENTIRE STATE AND YOU HEARD MS FLETCHER TALK ABOUT HOW WE ARE STARTING TO. REIMAGINE THE EIGHTY SIX ONE SEVEN FOR GRAHAM. I DON'T THINK ABOUT HOW WE PROVIDE BENEFITS NOT JUST TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN SORT OF FORMALLY SELECTED INTO THE PROGRAM THE COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE. AND SO WHAT THIS PROGRAM WOULD DO IS ALLOW US TO PROVIDE ALL THE COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE THE SNAPSHOT OF WHAT THEIR AIR QUALITY LOOKS LIKE AND A VERY FINE SORT OF DETAILED LEVEL AND SO THAT THEY HAVE THAT INFORMATION IT'S TRANSPARENCY FOR ALL OF THESE COMMUNITIES. AND GIVES THEM A HEAD START I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE AIR QUALITY IN THEIR COMMUNITY IS- DEPENDING ON WHAT WE SEE IN THAT MONITORING IT MIGHT GIVE US SOME CLUES ABOUT SOURCES THAT WE WEREN'T EXPECTING TO SEE IN THOSE AREAS. AND TO HELP US TARGET ADDITIONAL TOXIC MONITORING THAT MIGHT BE YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAILS OR AND IN IN A SORT OF A SPECIAL MONITORING PROGRAM TO LOOK AT THINGS THAT WE CAN EXPECT WELL I UNDERSTAND- THE VALUE THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO WHAT I'M ASKING IS IF THERE WERE TO BE A MORE- AMBITIOUS. AND ROBUST AND LONG TERM- A PROJECT THAT INCLUDED THE- CREATING A BASELINE BUT- YOU KNOW MIGHT BE MORE EXPENSIVE BUT- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF WE WERE ABLE TO GET- WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. PLUS A LONG TERM- ADDED THE- A BENEFIT. WHY WOULD WE NOT DO THAT AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT EXISTS BUT- MIGHT. YES THERE ARE I MEAN I THINK THAT PART OF THIS IS LOOKING AT SORT OF WHAT IS THE GOAL THAT WE ARE TRYING TEN TO ACHIEVE AND SO IN ANY AIR MONITORING PROGRAM THE GOAL YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE EXPENDING YOUR RESOURCES IN THE RIGHT WAY AND SO AS I SAID- WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE ALL COMMUNITIES WHERE THIS ONE TIME SNAPSHOT OF WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE- AT AIR QUALITY IS RIGHT NOW. IF THIS PROGRAM IS SUCCESSFUL WE WOULD LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO COME BACK AND MONITOR AIR QUALITY SO THAT WE CAN COMPARE THAT AGAINST THE SNAPSHOT SO LET ME ASK MY QUESTION A DIFFERENT WAY BECAUSE I. DON'T THINK WERE- A COMMUNICATING HIS WEALTH I'D LIKE TO- SORRY IS THERE ARE WIDE YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S PROBABLY THE WAY I'M ASKING MY QUESTIONS. I'M IT IS THEIR TECHNOLOGY- OUT THERE OR THAT'S PROPOSED THAT- COULD PROVIDE. THE INFORMATION AND BASS LINE AND ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. BUT BE MORE INCLUSIVE OF OTHER INFORMATION AND- MONITOR- LONG TERM CHANGES MID. NEAR MID TERM AND LONG RIGHT- CHANGE YEAH. YEAH NO I APPRECIATE THIS THE QUESTION. SO WE HAVE A NETWORK OF ABOUT FOURTEEN TOXICS MONITORING SITES RIGHT NOW WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THESE ARE LONG TERM SITES THAT WE HAVE BEEN AT WORK DECADES QUITE HONESTLY. AND SO WE CAN USE THOSE SITES T EVALUATE THEIR- VERY SOPHISTICATED. MONITORING IN TERMS OF THE KINDS OF- OF SUBSTANCES THAT WE CAN DO TAX- AND WE CAN LOOK AT TRENDS AT THOSE SITES SO OVER. THE AND OVER THE YEARS WE CAN SEE WE'VE SEEN REDUCTIONS IN PRETTY MUCH ALL TOXICS AT ALL OF THOSE SITES. SO BUT THEY ARE ONLY FOURTEEN SITES AROUND THE WHOLE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO DO PROGRAMS WHERE WE TO YOU WHAT I WOULD CALL SPECIAL MONITORING. SO THAT THE PROGRAM THAT THE LEGISLATURE FUNDED THAT WE CALL SNAPS. AND IT'S A PROGRAM THAT MONITORS AND IT'S THAT SORT OF A SPECIAL STUDY WHERE WE GO TO COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DOWNWIND OF- HOPE PETROLEUM PRODUCTION. AND WE SET UP IT IS A TEMPORARY MONITORING BUT IT IS IT'S BEEN OVER THERE FOR ABOUT A YEAR. SO GAIN WE SET UP A STATIONARY SITE BUT IT'S TEMPORARY WHERE THERE FOR A YEAR WE LOOK AT THE COMMUNITIES ON WHERE WE SHOULD CITE THE MONITORS. AND SAID THAT PROVIDES. US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE OVER THE COURSE CITY YOUR HOW EMISSIONS CHANGE. PERHAPS SEASON BASE CIRCUIT BECAUSE THERE'S DIFFERENT ACTIVE HAPPEN AND YOU KNOW IN THAT PRODUCTION FACILITY. ARE IT ALSO PROVIDES US WITH ENOUGH INFORMATION THAT WE CAN WORK WITH- A WE HOT ON THE OFFICE AT ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT TO DO HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTS BASED ON THAT DATA BECAUSE PREPARE. FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. IN DEVELOPING THIS PROPOSAL- DID YOU- EVALUATE OTHER APPROACHES. WELL I EIGHT IF THEY SAID- IF THE INTENT IS TO TRY TO PROVIDE ALL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA WITH A BASELINE OF WHAT THEIR AIR QUALITY LOOKS LIKE AND THIS IS REALLY THE FASTEST WAY TO DO IT SO. GRANTED YOUR DID YOU EVALUATE OTHER. PROPOSALS THAN THE ONE. THAT YOU'RE PUTTING FORWARD HERE TODAY. I WOULD SAY THE ISN'T ANOTHER WAY TO PROVIDE THIS SNAPSHOT IN THIS QUICKLY IN THIS QUICKLY AND PROBABLY FOR THIS COST- I'D JUST THE YOU KNOW PROGRAM THAT I WAS TALKING AT ABOUT WERE BEACH YOU AND IN ORDER TO KIND OF GO SOMEPLACE FOR A YEAR AND YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE SMALL COMMUNITY THAT WE DO AND IF WE DID THAT AROUND THE ENTIRE STATE THAT WOULD TAKE. THAT WOULD TAKE A FEW YEARS TO GET TO EVERY COMMUNITY I SEE OKAY- THANK YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION. OF FOR YOUR RESPONSES. MISTER BENNETT- HE- I JUST TO WANT TO WEIGH IN BUT OVERALL. I'VE HAD A FAIR AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THE- LUCIEN MONITORING DONE IN VENTURA COUNTY THE APPLICATION OF THE PESTICIDE SO WE HAVE ONE OF THOSE FOURTEEN- AREAS- AND THERE'S CONSTANT REQUEST FOR OTHER COMMUNITIES TO HAVE THERE ARE TESTED- SO I CERTAINLY SEE THE ADVANTAGE- THAT THE STAFF. IS JUST TRYING TO REFER TO IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO GET TO A COMMUNITY AT LEAST SAY ONE TIME YES IT THERE IS A PROBLEM HERE THERE'S NOT A PROBLEM HERE SO I THINK THESE ARE IT'S GOOD FOR US TO BE TRYING TO EVALUATE THIS- IF THERE. IF WE ONLY HAVE FOURTEEN AT THIS POINT TIME THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO A BLANK AT THE STATE AND IN TERMS OF MORE PERMANENT INFRASTRUCTURE- US A STEP IN IN MY MIND A STEP BEFORE YOU DO THAT IS YOU. GO OUT AND YOU TAKE THE SAMPLES TO FIND OUT WHERE YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOCATE THOSE SO- SO OVERALL I APPRECIATE- JUST FROM OUR COMMUNITIES ASK OUR AND REQUEST OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO HAVE A MOBILE OF TESTING SO I COME IN. AND MAYBE I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THEY WOULD STAY A COUPLE OF DAYS MAYBE TO CHECK DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE DAY- BUT I SEE SOME SOME SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES THERE- IF THERE'S SOME OTHER WAYS TO TRY TO GET MORE BANG FOR THIS- BUT WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IT BUT I DO- GENERALLY SEE SOME REAL ADVANTAGES TO THE- ABILITY TO GET. LOTS OF PLACES IN THE STATE TEN AT LEAST BEGIN THE PROCESS OF FIGURING OUT WHERE WHERE WE MIGHT WANT TO PUT. PERMANENT STATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE ADD A COMMENT- AND THAT- CONCLUDES THE ISSUE THREE. AGAIN WERE- TAKING NO VOTES ON THAT- AND THE ISSUE TODAY BUT- THIS IS THE POINT AND- IN THE MEETING WHERE I GET TO ASK IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ABOUT NON DISCUSSION ITEMS.
