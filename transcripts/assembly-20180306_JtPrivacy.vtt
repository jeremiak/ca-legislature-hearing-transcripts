TECHNOLOGIES

00:24:35.708 --> 00:24:39.311 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN AT THE

00:24:37.443 --> 00:24:40.679 region:rollup2
FOREFRONT OF INNOVATION. BECAUSE

00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:41.914 region:rollup2
IT IS HOME TO SOME OF THE

00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:44.016 region:rollup2
WORLD'S LARGEST TECHNOLOGY

00:24:41.914 --> 00:24:45.084 region:rollup2
CORPORATIONS.

00:24:44.016 --> 00:24:46.986 region:rollup2
THESE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE

00:24:45.084 --> 00:24:48.120 region:rollup2
TRANSFORM OUR LIVES

00:24:46.986 --> 00:24:49.988 region:rollup2
FROM THE WAY WE WORK TO HOW WE

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.724 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATE.

00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:53.425 region:rollup2
AND THEY CONTINUE TO DO SO WITH

00:24:51.724 --> 00:24:55.627 region:rollup2
EACH PASSING DAY.

00:24:53.425 --> 00:24:56.862 region:rollup2
BUT THE VERY PROMISES OF THESE

00:24:55.627 --> 00:24:58.430 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES HAVE ALSO

00:24:56.862 --> 00:25:01.166 region:rollup2
CHALLENGED US.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:03.135 region:rollup2
TO FOCUS ON THE LONG TERM IMPACT

00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:04.370 region:rollup2
THEY CAN HAVE ON SOCIETY.

00:25:03.135 --> 00:25:06.372 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THESE POLICIES ARE

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:08.674 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST

00:25:06.372 --> 00:25:10.309 region:rollup2
THEIR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

00:25:08.674 --> 00:25:12.778 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT OUR APPROACH TO

00:25:10.309 --> 00:25:15.147 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY POLICY IN THE STATE.

00:25:12.778 --> 00:25:15.681 region:rollup2
HOUSE THE POTENTIAL OF NOT ONLY

00:25:15.147 --> 00:25:17.349 region:rollup2
INFORMING THE REST OF THE

00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:17.916 region:rollup2
COUNTRY.

00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:20.452 region:rollup2
BUT THE REST OF THE WORLD AS

00:25:17.916 --> 00:25:21.887 region:rollup2
WELL.

00:25:20.452 --> 00:25:24.356 region:rollup2
ONE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT

IMPLICATIONS IS ARTIFICIAL

00:25:26.392 --> 00:25:30.429 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE OR A AYE.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:32.197 region:rollup2
A I IS AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY

00:25:30.429 --> 00:25:34.166 region:rollup2
THAT IS A LINE AROUND THE

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:37.102 region:rollup2
CONCEPT OF CREATING COMPUTER

00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:38.404 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS OR MACHINES CAPABLE OF

00:25:37.102 --> 00:25:39.638 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENT BEHAVIOR.

00:25:38.404 --> 00:25:41.607 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO THAT EXHIBITED BY

00:25:39.638 --> 00:25:43.609 region:rollup2
HUMANS.

00:25:41.607 --> 00:25:44.743 region:rollup2
AS NOTED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER

00:25:43.609 --> 00:25:46.378 region:rollup2
A AYE HOUSE IN INCREDIBLE

00:25:44.743 --> 00:25:48.847 region:rollup2
ABILITY.

00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:51.083 region:rollup2
CREATE A GLOBAL PARADIGM SHIFT.

00:25:48.847 --> 00:25:52.785 region:rollup2
THAT MAY PROPEL SOCIETY INTO AN

AUTOMATION AGE.

00:25:52.785 --> 00:25:56.422 region:rollup2
AND PROPOSED UNIQUE SOLUTIONS TO

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.323 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST

00:25:56.422 --> 00:25:59.324 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS.

00:25:58.323 --> 00:26:01.126 region:rollup2
BUT IT ALSO COMES WITH ITS OWN

00:25:59.324 --> 00:26:03.262 region:rollup2
WRISTS.

00:26:01.126 --> 00:26:05.164 region:rollup2
INCLUDING DISPLACING WORKERS

00:26:03.262 --> 00:26:07.833 region:rollup2
BIAS ALL LOSS OF PRIVACY AMONG

00:26:05.164 --> 00:26:09.868 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS.

00:26:07.833 --> 00:26:11.937 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT A I WILL POST LEGAL

00:26:09.868 --> 00:26:14.339 region:rollup2
AND ETHICAL CONCERNS THAT WILL

00:26:11.937 --> 00:26:16.375 region:rollup2
REQUIRE INVOLVEMENT. FROM ALL

00:26:14.339 --> 00:26:18.577 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS.

00:26:16.375 --> 00:26:20.479 region:rollup2
WE AS LEGISLATORS MUST

00:26:18.577 --> 00:26:22.681 region:rollup2
FACILITATE DOT DIALOGUE.

00:26:20.479 --> 00:26:25.083 region:rollup2
FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN.

JUST THAT.

00:26:34.993 --> 00:26:37.396 region:rollup2
IT WILL EXAMINE THE PROMISES AND

00:26:36.829 --> 00:26:40.299 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH A

00:26:37.396 --> 00:26:41.567 region:rollup2
AYE.

00:26:40.299 --> 00:26:42.935 region:rollup2
HOW OVERALL ENDEAVOR IS TO

NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS.

00:26:57.883 --> 00:27:01.386 region:rollup2
AND ALSO HOW THE LEGISLATURE

00:26:59.151 --> 00:27:04.089 region:rollup2
SHOULD BEGIN.

00:27:01.386 --> 00:27:05.791 region:rollup2
PAIR TO THINK ABOUT AND ADDRESS.

00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:07.359 region:rollup2
OR NOT ADDRESS ISSUES THAT MAY

00:27:05.791 --> 00:27:10.295 region:rollup2
ARISE AS A RESULT OF A AYE

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:11.964 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS.

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:14.800 region:rollup2
IN DETERMINING HOW WE OPPOSE

00:27:11.964 --> 00:27:16.969 region:rollup2
THIS COMPLEX AND EMERGING ISSUE

ACTUALLY HEARING.

00:27:59.478 --> 00:28:03.749 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS IS A TREMENDOUSLY

00:28:01.413 --> 00:28:05.951 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TOPIC AND IT'S BECAUSE

00:28:03.749 --> 00:28:07.452 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE AT AN

00:28:05.951 --> 00:28:08.754 region:rollup2
INFLECTION POINT. WHERE THESE

00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:10.055 region:rollup2
EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES ARE GOING

00:28:08.754 --> 00:28:12.824 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A TRANSFER MORE A

00:28:10.055 --> 00:28:14.126 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATIVE IMPACT ON OUR

00:28:12.824 --> 00:28:15.627 region:rollup2
SOCIETY AND OUR GOVERNMENT AND

00:28:14.126 --> 00:28:17.262 region:rollup2
THEIR CATALYZED BY RECENT

00:28:15.627 --> 00:28:19.197 region:rollup2
ADVANCEMENTS IN A AYE? IF YOU

00:28:17.262 --> 00:28:20.999 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT IT A AYE IS JUST NOW

00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:22.034 region:rollup2
GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S

00:28:20.999 --> 00:28:23.769 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT'S AFFECTING OUR

00:28:22.034 --> 00:28:26.738 region:rollup2
DAILY LIVES ONE WHEN I WAS DOING

00:28:23.769 --> 00:28:27.439 region:rollup2
RESEARCH IT ON A AYE AT CALTECH

00:28:26.738 --> 00:28:29.174 region:rollup2
IN YOU LEADER UCLA.

00:28:27.439 --> 00:28:31.176 region:rollup2
A I WAS SOMETHING THAT COULD

00:28:29.174 --> 00:28:32.644 region:rollup2
SOLVE A SIMPLE PROBLEM OVERNIGHT

00:28:31.176 --> 00:28:34.980 region:rollup2
RUNNING ON A ROOM SIZED COMPUTER

00:28:32.644 --> 00:28:36.648 region:rollup2
AND NOW. WE ALL CARRY AROUND IN

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.317 region:rollup2
OUR POCKET DEVICES.

00:28:36.648 --> 00:28:39.117 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN SAY HEY SEERY PLACE

00:28:38.317 --> 00:28:41.119 region:rollup2
SOME BEATLES AND IF YOU THINK

00:28:39.117 --> 00:28:42.154 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:43.355 region:rollup2
GOES INTO FOR FILLING THAT

00:28:42.154 --> 00:28:44.823 region:rollup2
REQUEST.

00:28:43.355 --> 00:28:46.358 region:rollup2
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE

00:28:44.823 --> 00:28:47.793 region:rollup2
JUST BOGGLES THE MIND EVEN

00:28:46.358 --> 00:28:49.294 region:rollup2
THIRTY YEARS AGO SO.

00:28:47.793 --> 00:28:50.562 region:rollup2
THOSE COULD HAVE SOME VERY

00:28:49.294 --> 00:28:52.030 region:rollup2
POSITIVE IMPACTS ON OUR

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:53.832 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT AND OUR SOCIETY BUT

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:55.968 region:rollup2
ALSO I THINK IT'S FRAUGHT WITH

00:28:53.832 --> 00:28:57.035 region:rollup2
PERIL IN CHALLENGES FOR US. AS

00:28:55.968 --> 00:28:58.337 region:rollup2
WE EXAMINE THE WAYS IN WHICH

00:28:57.035 --> 00:29:01.006 region:rollup2
THESE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES

00:28:58.337 --> 00:29:02.441 region:rollup2
IMPACT PRIVACY OTHER WAYS IMPACT

00:29:01.006 --> 00:29:04.042 region:rollup2
GOVERNANCE AND.

00:29:02.441 --> 00:29:06.011 region:rollup2
THE WAYS THAT IMPACT MORALITY

00:29:04.042 --> 00:29:07.446 region:rollup2
IN OUR SOCIETY SO I THINK IT'S A

00:29:06.011 --> 00:29:09.348 region:rollup2
VERY. IMPORTANT TOPIC FOR US TO

00:29:07.446 --> 00:29:10.682 region:rollup2
BE STRESSING THE LEGISLATURE AND

00:29:09.348 --> 00:29:11.617 region:rollup2
I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING

00:29:10.682 --> 00:29:12.184 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT DISCUSSION.

00:29:11.617 --> 00:29:14.319 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER

00:29:12.184 --> 00:29:15.454 region:rollup2
ACCARDO THEY DON'T WANT TO THINK

00:29:14.319 --> 00:29:18.090 region:rollup2
THE CHAIR AND.

00:29:15.454 --> 00:29:18.724 region:rollup2
VICE CHAIR FOR BRINGING US

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:20.425 region:rollup2
TOGETHER TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE

00:29:18.724 --> 00:29:21.460 region:rollup2
AT LEAST I TRY TO UNDERSTAND A

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:21.994 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT BETTER I MEAN I THINK

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.595 region:rollup2
APPROACHING THIS FROM A

00:29:21.994 --> 00:29:24.563 region:rollup2
STANDPOINT OF WORKFORCE AND WHAT

00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:26.732 region:rollup2
THIS MEANS IN TERMS OF.

00:29:24.563 --> 00:29:28.233 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTIFICIAL

00:29:26.732 --> 00:29:30.736 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE AND WHAT THAT MEANS

00:29:28.233 --> 00:29:31.803 region:rollup2
OFF FOR OUR ECONOMY MOVING

00:29:30.736 --> 00:29:34.172 region:rollup2
FORWARD IN THAT STATE OF THAT AS

00:29:31.803 --> 00:29:35.007 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND AS A LEGISLATIVE

00:29:34.172 --> 00:29:35.774 region:rollup2
BODY WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO

00:29:35.007 --> 00:29:37.709 region:rollup2
PROMOTE.

00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:39.745 region:rollup2
AND HAVE AN INDUSTRY THAT

00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:40.312 region:rollup2
FOSTERS CREATIVITY AND

00:29:39.745 --> 00:29:42.080 region:rollup2
INNOVATION.

00:29:40.312 --> 00:29:44.516 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S ALSO REAL

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:46.685 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO.

00:29:44.516 --> 00:29:47.686 region:rollup2
THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE

00:29:46.685 --> 00:29:49.054 region:rollup2
TAKING THE ROLE THAT WAS ONCE

00:29:47.686 --> 00:29:50.055 region:rollup2
FILLED BY AN INDIVIDUAL AND WHEN

00:29:49.054 --> 00:29:51.790 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE SO MANY OTHER

00:29:50.055 --> 00:29:53.158 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES ARE THAT WE'RE FACING

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.626 region:rollup2
AS A STATE.

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:56.428 region:rollup2
WHAT DOES THAT DO?

00:29:54.626 --> 00:29:57.929 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF.

00:29:56.428 --> 00:30:00.432 region:rollup2
EITHER HELPING OR OR

00:29:57.929 --> 00:30:01.333 region:rollup2
EXACERBATING THIS PROBLEM. AND

00:30:00.432 --> 00:30:02.768 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU KNOW IS BEING DONE OR

00:30:01.333 --> 00:30:04.736 region:rollup2
COULD CAN BE DONE TO USE

00:30:02.768 --> 00:30:07.372 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:09.675 region:rollup2
TO TO TRY TO HELP US SOLVE

00:30:07.372 --> 00:30:10.609 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES ARE AND AND MAKE

00:30:09.675 --> 00:30:11.209 region:rollup2
THINGS A LITTLE BIT BETTER FOR

00:30:10.609 --> 00:30:12.744 region:rollup2
FOLKS.

00:30:11.209 --> 00:30:14.980 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

00:30:12.744 --> 00:30:15.580 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ASPECTS TO THIS ISSUE

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.648 region:rollup2
I MEAN THAT AND I THINK THAT

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:19.284 region:rollup2
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT.

00:30:16.648 --> 00:30:21.553 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE I A

00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:22.788 region:rollup2
I THAT YOU KNOW HOW MY COLLEAGUE

00:30:21.553 --> 00:30:26.625 region:rollup2
WAS TALKING ABOUT WHETHER IT'S

00:30:22.788 --> 00:30:27.559 region:rollup2
IN OUR PHONE WHICH IS MORE. I TO

00:30:26.625 --> 00:30:30.128 region:rollup2
ME PROGRAMS AND PREDICTIVE AS

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:32.030 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO SOMETHING THAT'S

00:30:30.128 --> 00:30:33.565 region:rollup2
LITERALLY THINKING ON ITS OWN

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.766 region:rollup2
AND AND AND AND THE AT THE

00:30:33.565 --> 00:30:37.269 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS OF THAT.

00:30:34.766 --> 00:30:40.772 region:rollup2
AND THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO

00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:43.942 region:rollup2
CONTAIN A CONTROL THAT.

00:30:40.772 --> 00:30:45.210 region:rollup2
AS A PUT IT AS IT COMES TO

00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:48.380 region:rollup2
PRIVACY IN DIFFERENT.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:50.415 region:rollup2
NOT PROTECTIONS ARE THAT WE

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:53.218 region:rollup2
WOULD ALL WANT TO HAVE SO THESE

00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:55.387 region:rollup2
REALLY INTERESTING CONVERSATION

00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:56.588 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY IS A STATE ONE

00:30:55.387 --> 00:30:57.422 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BE A LEADER IN THIS

00:30:56.588 --> 00:30:59.224 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

00:30:57.422 --> 00:31:01.526 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY

00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:05.030 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT.

00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:07.466 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT IT IT IS IS GONNA

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:10.869 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BE A MORE AND MORE

00:31:07.466 --> 00:31:15.207 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT CONVERSATION HAVE A

00:31:10.869 --> 00:31:15.741 region:rollup2
MORE SIGNIFICANT FOOTPRINT. UP

00:31:15.207 --> 00:31:21.646 region:rollup2
HERE WHAT DAY AND I THINK

00:31:15.741 --> 00:31:22.180 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY WHO'S

ANYTIME YOU'RE READY THANK YOU

00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:04.956 region:rollup2
DEAR.

00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:06.425 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN CHAO YOUR MEMBERS OF

00:32:04.956 --> 00:32:07.926 region:rollup2
BOTH COMMITTEES THANK YOU FOR

00:32:06.425 --> 00:32:08.493 region:rollup2
HAVING ME HERE TODAY IS BOTH A

00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:11.263 region:rollup2
PLEASURE.

00:32:08.493 --> 00:32:11.696 region:rollup2
AND THE PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE

00:32:11.263 --> 00:32:14.566 region:rollup2
AND HELP IN THIS.

00:32:11.696 --> 00:32:15.534 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT EXPLORATION OF

00:32:14.566 --> 00:32:17.836 region:rollup2
THEIRS OF VERY IMPORTANT PROBLEM

00:32:15.534 --> 00:32:18.603 region:rollup2
THAT WERE THAT WERE FACING.

00:32:17.836 --> 00:32:21.873 region:rollup2
AND I CALLED A PROBLEM.

00:32:18.603 --> 00:32:22.407 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO HARNESS

00:32:21.873 --> 00:32:25.544 region:rollup2
THE POWER OF ARTIFICIAL

00:32:22.407 --> 00:32:25.811 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE WHILE. ABOUNDING IN

00:32:25.544 --> 00:32:30.148 region:rollup2
SHAPING.

00:32:25.811 --> 00:32:32.150 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES THAT IT OFFERS.

00:32:30.148 --> 00:32:33.018 region:rollup2
TO WE ARE INDEED AT THE

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:36.455 region:rollup2
THRESHOLD AT THE MOMENT.

00:32:33.018 --> 00:32:38.824 region:rollup2
BETWEEN.

00:32:36.455 --> 00:32:39.424 region:rollup2
A AYE BEING.

00:32:38.824 --> 00:32:40.625 region:rollup2
A.

00:32:39.424 --> 00:32:41.693 region:rollup2
NEW DEVELOPMENT THAT PROMISES

00:32:40.625 --> 00:32:43.528 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE

00:32:41.693 --> 00:32:44.262 region:rollup2
ECONOMY AND THE I ALSO CAUSING

00:32:43.528 --> 00:32:46.431 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS IN

00:32:44.262 --> 00:32:48.567 region:rollup2
SOCIETY.

00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:52.871 region:rollup2
WE ARE TORN BETWEEN.

00:32:48.567 --> 00:32:53.638 region:rollup2
THE HUMILITY OF SCIENTISTS

00:32:52.871 --> 00:32:55.674 region:rollup2
WHO ARE TRYING TO KEEP

00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:59.177 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE ON RECENT

00:32:55.674 --> 00:33:01.012 region:rollup2
BREAKTHROUGHS AND ADVANCES AND

00:32:59.177 --> 00:33:02.614 region:rollup2
THE BRAZEN RESOLVE OF

00:33:01.012 --> 00:33:03.582 region:rollup2
ENTREPRENEURS THAT HAVE MADE TO

00:33:02.614 --> 00:33:04.082 region:rollup2
STATE GREAT.

00:33:03.582 --> 00:33:06.751 region:rollup2
AND.

00:33:04.082 --> 00:33:07.719 region:rollup2
REALLY THE MIDDLE GROUND FOR A.

00:33:06.751 --> 00:33:10.188 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTIVE PRODUCTIVE SOCIETY

00:33:07.719 --> 00:33:11.256 region:rollup2
LIES IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN BOTH.

00:33:10.188 --> 00:33:12.624 region:rollup2
SO I'M GRATEFUL TO BE ASKED

00:33:11.256 --> 00:33:13.859 region:rollup2
TODAY TO OPINE ON THIS AND WOULD

00:33:12.624 --> 00:33:15.727 region:rollup2
LIKE TO GIVE YOU MY PERSPECTIVE.

00:33:13.859 --> 00:33:16.695 region:rollup2
AND THEN ALSO DRAW SOME

00:33:15.727 --> 00:33:17.462 region:rollup2
CONCLUSIONS ON WHAT I THINK

00:33:16.695 --> 00:33:19.464 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CAN DO AND WHY

00:33:17.462 --> 00:33:22.033 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE SHOULD BE

00:33:19.464 --> 00:33:22.300 region:rollup2
CONCERNED AND VERY MUCH INVOLVED

00:33:22.033 --> 00:33:24.269 region:rollup2
IN THIS.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.804 region:rollup2
I WAS ASKED TO LAY THE

00:33:24.269 --> 00:33:27.906 region:rollup2
GROUNDWORK A BIT AND GIVE A FEW

00:33:25.804 --> 00:33:30.408 region:rollup2
DEFINITIONS ABOUT ONE A I MEAN

00:33:27.906 --> 00:33:32.410 region:rollup2
SO BEAR WITH ME WHILE I DO THAT.

00:33:30.408 --> 00:33:33.512 region:rollup2
I'M GOING TO TRY TO BE AS BASIC

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:34.646 region:rollup2
ON THIS.

00:33:33.512 --> 00:33:36.615 region:rollup2
AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT IS

00:33:34.646 --> 00:33:38.316 region:rollup2
CONFUSING THERE IS A LOT OF

00:33:36.615 --> 00:33:38.950 region:rollup2
NOISE OUT THERE.

00:33:38.316 --> 00:33:39.484 region:rollup2
BETWEEN.

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:42.754 region:rollup2
THE SKEPTICS.

00:33:39.484 --> 00:33:44.222 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THOSE THAT.

00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:45.423 region:rollup2
DEPICT AN ARTIFICIAL

00:33:44.222 --> 00:33:47.292 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE IN MOVIES.

00:33:45.423 --> 00:33:48.293 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF NOISE THAT'S

00:33:47.292 --> 00:33:49.361 region:rollup2
VERY ENTERTAINING BUT

00:33:48.293 --> 00:33:50.128 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY NOT VERY

00:33:49.361 --> 00:33:52.430 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTIVE.

00:33:50.128 --> 00:33:53.965 region:rollup2
CLEARLY DETERMINES OVERHYPED

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:56.902 region:rollup2
WHAT IT IS SENSUALLY ENTAILS IS

00:33:53.965 --> 00:33:58.103 region:rollup2
AN ARRAY OF TECHNOLOGIES MAINLY

00:33:56.902 --> 00:34:00.672 region:rollup2
COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES.

00:33:58.103 --> 00:34:02.073 region:rollup2
THAT SIMULATE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE

00:34:00.672 --> 00:34:05.010 region:rollup2
NORMALLY PERFORMED BY THE HUMAN

00:34:02.073 --> 00:34:06.511 region:rollup2
BRAIN COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:08.613 region:rollup2
SO AMONGST THOSE ARE THINGS LIKE

00:34:06.511 --> 00:34:10.815 region:rollup2
SPEECH RECOGNITION LANGUAGE

00:34:08.613 --> 00:34:13.251 region:rollup2
TRANSLATION IMAGE RECOGNITION.

00:34:10.815 --> 00:34:15.153 region:rollup2
ABOUT ALSO THINGS AS BASIC AS

00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:16.788 region:rollup2
ADVANCED STATISTICAL.

00:34:15.153 --> 00:34:18.690 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGIES AND PREDICTIVE

00:34:16.788 --> 00:34:19.691 region:rollup2
ANALYTICS.

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:21.559 region:rollup2
SO WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT.

00:34:19.691 --> 00:34:22.928 region:rollup2
STATISTICS AT SOME POINT COULD

00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:24.362 region:rollup2
BECOME SO SEXY.

00:34:22.928 --> 00:34:25.530 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW SO IT IS DEFINITELY

00:34:24.362 --> 00:34:27.632 region:rollup2
PART OF THE PICTURE.

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:29.467 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO DISTINGUISH HERE.

00:34:27.632 --> 00:34:31.002 region:rollup2
THESE TECHNOLOGIES BETWEEN

00:34:29.467 --> 00:34:33.004 region:rollup2
WHAT'S CALLED A GENERAL

00:34:31.002 --> 00:34:35.807 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

00:34:33.004 --> 00:34:37.575 region:rollup2
AND NO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

00:34:35.807 --> 00:34:39.477 region:rollup2
MOST OF THE PUBLIC ATTENTION

00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:41.212 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN CAPTURED BY THE GENERAL

00:34:39.477 --> 00:34:43.782 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHICH IS

00:34:41.212 --> 00:34:45.350 region:rollup2
OFTEN PREDICTED BY HOLLYWOOD AS

00:34:43.782 --> 00:34:46.518 region:rollup2
SUPER HUMAN INTELLIGENCE.

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:48.153 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE KIND OF INTELLIGENCE

00:34:46.518 --> 00:34:49.621 region:rollup2
THAT ONLY HUMANS AND ANIMALS TO

00:34:48.153 --> 00:34:52.691 region:rollup2
DATE POSSESS.

00:34:49.621 --> 00:34:54.526 region:rollup2
TO VARYING DEGREES OF COURSE

00:34:52.691 --> 00:34:55.460 region:rollup2
AND IT IS ABLE TO.

00:34:54.526 --> 00:34:58.463 region:rollup2
LEARN.

00:34:55.460 --> 00:35:00.298 region:rollup2
WASTES A CERTAIN DATA SETS HOW

00:34:58.463 --> 00:35:01.766 region:rollup2
TO PERFORM CERTAIN FUNCTIONS AND

00:35:00.298 --> 00:35:03.335 region:rollup2
THEN TAKE THAT LEARNING AND

00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:05.003 region:rollup2
TRANSPOSE IT OVER INTO OTHER

00:35:03.335 --> 00:35:08.106 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS.

00:35:05.003 --> 00:35:10.275 region:rollup2
IT IS ABLE TO LEARN FROM UP TO

00:35:08.106 --> 00:35:12.444 region:rollup2
TO MEMORIZE PREVIEWS LEARNING

00:35:10.275 --> 00:35:14.779 region:rollup2
AND THEN APPLY LESSONS FROM THE

00:35:12.444 --> 00:35:17.248 region:rollup2
PAST TO FUTURE AND FORWARD

00:35:14.779 --> 00:35:17.849 region:rollup2
LOOKING PROBLEMS AGAIN THAT IS.

00:35:17.248 --> 00:35:19.751 region:rollup2
USUALLY.

00:35:17.849 --> 00:35:22.687 region:rollup2
USUALLY THE HUMAN DOMAIN.

00:35:19.751 --> 00:35:24.289 region:rollup2
A AND COMPUTER SCIENTISTS ARE

00:35:22.687 --> 00:35:26.458 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT GENERAL ARTIFICIAL

00:35:24.289 --> 00:35:28.727 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE MIGHT AT SOME POINT

00:35:26.458 --> 00:35:30.228 region:rollup2
BE POSSIBLE. BUT THIS IS DECADES

00:35:28.727 --> 00:35:32.964 region:rollup2
IN THE FUTURE SO EIGHT OUT OF

00:35:30.228 --> 00:35:34.499 region:rollup2
TEN SCIENTISTS TELL ME THAT

00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:36.101 region:rollup2
GENERAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

00:35:34.499 --> 00:35:38.303 region:rollup2
IS AT LEAST TWO TO THREE DECADES

00:35:36.101 --> 00:35:38.870 region:rollup2
AWAY AND THAT'S USUALLY THE

00:35:38.303 --> 00:35:40.505 region:rollup2
OPTIMISTIC SIDE OF THINGS.

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:42.607 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER

00:35:40.505 --> 00:35:44.542 region:rollup2
THAT IT HAS TAKEN US SEVENTY

00:35:42.607 --> 00:35:46.277 region:rollup2
YEARS TO GET TO THE CURRENT

00:35:44.542 --> 00:35:48.013 region:rollup2
POINT IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

00:35:46.277 --> 00:35:50.248 region:rollup2
OF COURSE BREAKTHROUGHS IN LEAPS

00:35:48.013 --> 00:35:51.049 region:rollup2
ARE POSSIBLE. NOW WE SHOULD

00:35:50.248 --> 00:35:52.784 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE THAT.

00:35:51.049 --> 00:35:53.918 region:rollup2
A NARROW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

00:35:52.784 --> 00:35:55.587 region:rollup2
IS MOST OF THE ARTIFICIAL

00:35:53.918 --> 00:35:57.689 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE THAT WE SEE TODAY

00:35:55.587 --> 00:35:59.090 region:rollup2
IT IS VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON VERY

00:35:57.689 --> 00:36:00.992 region:rollup2
DISCREET FUNCTIONS.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:02.994 region:rollup2
SO WHEN YOU SEE.

00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:04.596 region:rollup2
IBM'S DEEP BLUE BEATING SOMEBODY

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:07.699 region:rollup2

00:36:04.596 --> 00:36:09.668 region:rollup2
GOOGLE DEEP MIND ALPHA GO BEAT

00:36:07.699 --> 00:36:11.169 region:rollup2
THE WORLD'S RATING GO CHAMPION

00:36:09.668 --> 00:36:12.537 region:rollup2
THOSE OR OF CAR COURSE

00:36:11.169 --> 00:36:13.104 region:rollup2
IMPRESSIVE FEATS.

00:36:12.537 --> 00:36:15.073 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE VERY NARROW IN

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:16.708 region:rollup2
FUNCTION.

00:36:15.073 --> 00:36:18.977 region:rollup2
IN OTHER WORDS.

00:36:16.708 --> 00:36:21.379 region:rollup2
THE TASK FOR THE COMPUTER IS TO

00:36:18.977 --> 00:36:21.980 region:rollup2
BEAT THEIR HUMAN CHESS CHAMPION.

00:36:21.379 --> 00:36:24.449 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:27.719 region:rollup2
AS THE MACHINE THE I CANNOT

00:36:24.449 --> 00:36:28.687 region:rollup2
TELL YOU WHY IT IS MOVING.

00:36:27.719 --> 00:36:31.222 region:rollup2
A.

00:36:28.687 --> 00:36:33.758 region:rollup2
CERTAIN OF FIGURE ON THE CHESS

00:36:31.222 --> 00:36:35.960 region:rollup2
BOARD IN A CERTAIN WAY. OR WHY

00:36:33.758 --> 00:36:38.963 region:rollup2
IT IS PROTECTING THE KING.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:40.932 region:rollup2
IT CAN EQUALLY NOT TELL YOU

00:36:38.963 --> 00:36:43.201 region:rollup2
WHICH GAME TO PLAY TO SOLVE A

00:36:40.932 --> 00:36:44.969 region:rollup2
CERTAIN PROBLEM A CANNOT CHOOSE

00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:46.471 region:rollup2
BETWEEN CHESS AND GO ANOTHER.

00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:48.139 region:rollup2
OTHER GAMES

00:36:46.471 --> 00:36:50.842 region:rollup2
SO IT IS VERY LIMITED IN ITS

00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:52.911 region:rollup2
SCOPE AND IN THE TASK THAT IT IS

00:36:50.842 --> 00:36:55.513 region:rollup2
DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE.

00:36:52.911 --> 00:36:57.348 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT SAID THEN.

00:36:55.513 --> 00:36:58.450 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES THAT

00:36:57.348 --> 00:36:59.918 region:rollup2
YOU HEAR MENTIONED ARE.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:02.187 region:rollup2
.

00:36:59.918 --> 00:37:03.888 region:rollup2
DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS AND MACHINE

00:37:02.187 --> 00:37:06.491 region:rollup2
LEARNING THOSE ARE.

00:37:03.888 --> 00:37:07.392 region:rollup2
REALLY IS A MOST RECENT

00:37:06.491 --> 00:37:08.927 region:rollup2
BREAKTHROUGHS IN COMPUTER

00:37:07.392 --> 00:37:10.628 region:rollup2
SCIENCE WHEN IT COMES TO

00:37:08.927 --> 00:37:13.364 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

00:37:10.628 --> 00:37:15.800 region:rollup2
THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT NOT JUST

00:37:13.364 --> 00:37:16.768 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY SOLVE COGNITIVE

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.336 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS.

00:37:16.768 --> 00:37:21.406 region:rollup2
FOR US.

00:37:18.336 --> 00:37:22.941 region:rollup2
FOR HADES BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY

00:37:21.406 --> 00:37:25.110 region:rollup2
HAVE PHYSICAL INSTANTIATIONS.

00:37:22.941 --> 00:37:26.644 region:rollup2
SO WE ARE INCREASINGLY SEEING

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:28.747 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DRIVING

00:37:26.644 --> 00:37:31.282 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE ROBOTS.

00:37:28.747 --> 00:37:33.284 region:rollup2
AUTOMATION AND FACTORIES

00:37:31.282 --> 00:37:34.185 region:rollup2
AUTONOMOUS FUNCTIONS IN VEHICLES

00:37:33.284 --> 00:37:35.854 region:rollup2
AND DRONES.

00:37:34.185 --> 00:37:37.222 region:rollup2
EVEN YOUR THERMOSTAT IN YOUR

00:37:35.854 --> 00:37:39.858 region:rollup2
HOME.

00:37:37.222 --> 00:37:41.626 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO I IN THIS IS MORE THAN

00:37:39.858 --> 00:37:43.394 region:rollup2
JUST A COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT IS

00:37:41.626 --> 00:37:44.963 region:rollup2
WELL CONTAINED IN A BOX OR IN A

00:37:43.394 --> 00:37:46.498 region:rollup2
NETWORK IT IS INCREASINGLY

00:37:44.963 --> 00:37:48.333 region:rollup2
DEFINING OUR PHYSICAL

00:37:46.498 --> 00:37:49.601 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT AS WELL.

00:37:48.333 --> 00:37:51.136 region:rollup2
THAT HAS DIFFERENT IMPACTS ON

00:37:49.601 --> 00:37:52.470 region:rollup2
OUR SOCIETY IF THE FIRST ONE IS

00:37:51.136 --> 00:37:54.072 region:rollup2
OF COURSE ECONOMIC.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.773 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THIS

00:37:54.072 --> 00:37:57.709 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN CHAO.

00:37:54.773 --> 00:37:57.909 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT ON TIED JOBS.

00:37:57.709 --> 00:37:59.677 region:rollup2
YEAH.

00:37:57.909 --> 00:38:01.479 region:rollup2
WE ARE ALREADY SEEING

00:37:59.677 --> 00:38:03.748 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:04.749 region:rollup2
AT FORCE IN ENTERPRISE

00:38:03.748 --> 00:38:07.819 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS.

00:38:04.749 --> 00:38:09.954 region:rollup2
WE ARE SEEING BASIC TASKS THAT

00:38:07.819 --> 00:38:12.157 region:rollup2
SEEM VERY HUMAN FOR US PERFORMED

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:15.360 region:rollup2
BY MACHINES SUCH AS SECRETARIAL.

00:38:12.157 --> 00:38:18.062 region:rollup2
SERVICES PERFORMED BY A ME.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:19.330 region:rollup2
AND ELLIE AND OTHERS OF VIRTUAL

00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:21.232 region:rollup2
SECRETARIES THAT.

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:22.700 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO PURE EMAIL

00:38:21.232 --> 00:38:23.768 region:rollup2
DIALOGUE BETWEEN YOU AND THEM

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.370 region:rollup2
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

00:38:23.768 --> 00:38:26.771 region:rollup2
DISTINGUISH THE COMPUTER FROM

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:28.506 region:rollup2
THE HUMAN.

00:38:26.771 --> 00:38:29.007 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS

00:38:28.506 --> 00:38:31.442 region:rollup2
HERE.

00:38:29.007 --> 00:38:32.777 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE TO DO WITH CHANGING

00:38:31.442 --> 00:38:34.679 region:rollup2
THE WAYS IN WHICH WE RELATE AND

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:37.348 region:rollup2
INTERACT.

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:39.083 region:rollup2
AND HOW WE COMMUNICATE TRUST

00:38:37.348 --> 00:38:40.318 region:rollup2
FOR INSTANCE VERY IMPORTANT. AND

00:38:39.083 --> 00:38:42.053 region:rollup2
THEN THEY ARE PURELY

00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:44.389 region:rollup2
PSYCHOLOGICAL ONES THAT.

00:38:42.053 --> 00:38:46.491 region:rollup2
ENABLE THAT HAVE A I HAD

00:38:44.389 --> 00:38:47.792 region:rollup2
CHANGED THE WAY IN IN WHICH WE

00:38:46.491 --> 00:38:50.361 region:rollup2
LOOK UPON OURSELVES.

00:38:47.792 --> 00:38:51.930 region:rollup2
AND IN WHICH WE CONCEIVE OF US

00:38:50.361 --> 00:38:55.133 region:rollup2
AS OF OURSELVES AS.

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:56.634 region:rollup2
PERSONS OF HAVING PERSONHOOD.

00:38:55.133 --> 00:38:58.703 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT AS WELL.

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:59.604 region:rollup2
WHY SHOULD WE CARE?

00:38:58.703 --> 00:39:02.373 region:rollup2
WHY SHOULD WE CARE?

00:38:59.604 --> 00:39:03.708 region:rollup2
AS CITIZENS AS POLICY MAKERS.

00:39:02.373 --> 00:39:06.477 region:rollup2
IN YOUR ROLE.

00:39:03.708 --> 00:39:09.847 region:rollup2
A AYE CHANGES.

00:39:06.477 --> 00:39:10.515 region:rollup2
THE WAY WE ACT OUT INTIMACY.

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:12.517 region:rollup2
SO.

00:39:10.515 --> 00:39:13.618 region:rollup2
THE COMPUTER AND THE

00:39:12.517 --> 00:39:15.453 region:rollup2
CORPORATION THAT OWNS THE

00:39:13.618 --> 00:39:16.854 region:rollup2
COMPUTER HAS A MUCH MORE

00:39:15.453 --> 00:39:18.423 region:rollup2
INTIMATE UNDERSTANDING OF WHO WE

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:21.092 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:39:18.423 --> 00:39:22.760 region:rollup2
AND WE ACCEPT THAT BECAUSE WE

00:39:21.092 --> 00:39:24.329 region:rollup2
GET SOMETHING IN RETURN

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:26.764 region:rollup2
BUT WE DON'T NECESSARILY

00:39:24.329 --> 00:39:28.800 region:rollup2
ACCEPTED AT IN FULL CONSCIOUS

00:39:26.764 --> 00:39:30.301 region:rollup2
CONSCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.669 region:rollup2
ASKED WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS

00:39:30.301 --> 00:39:33.171 region:rollup2
FOR US.

00:39:31.669 --> 00:39:34.239 region:rollup2
SO THE DEGREE OF INTIMACY

00:39:33.171 --> 00:39:35.840 region:rollup2
BETWEEN US IN THE MACHINE IS

00:39:34.239 --> 00:39:37.408 region:rollup2
CHANGING.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.943 region:rollup2
WE ARE TODAY IN A HYPER

00:39:37.408 --> 00:39:41.546 region:rollup2
CONNECTED WORLD.

00:39:38.943 --> 00:39:43.314 region:rollup2
SO THIS DEGREE OF CHANGE IS

00:39:41.546 --> 00:39:44.449 region:rollup2
SPREADING THROUGH NETWORKS AND

00:39:43.314 --> 00:39:46.217 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR SOCIETAL FABRIC VERY

00:39:44.449 --> 00:39:47.552 region:rollup2
FAST.

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:48.920 region:rollup2
IF WE I HAD HAPPENED IN THE

00:39:47.552 --> 00:39:50.622 region:rollup2
NINETEEN EIGHTIES WE WOULDN'T

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.457 region:rollup2
HAVE THE SAME PHENOMENON SIMPLY

00:39:50.622 --> 00:39:54.726 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE CONNECTIVITY THE

00:39:52.457 --> 00:39:55.493 region:rollup2
NETWORKS WERE IN THERE.

00:39:54.726 --> 00:39:57.095 region:rollup2
OUR THIRD.

00:39:55.493 --> 00:39:59.130 region:rollup2
A ICE CONNECTED WITH THE THINGS

00:39:57.095 --> 00:40:00.465 region:rollup2
THAT WE REALLY WANT ON MANY OF

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:01.933 region:rollup2
THESE INTERNET PLATFORMS WE GET

00:40:00.465 --> 00:40:03.801 region:rollup2
SERVICES WE GET PRODUCTS WE GET

00:40:01.933 --> 00:40:05.370 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE ERCEIVE

00:40:03.801 --> 00:40:07.138 region:rollup2
AS ENRICHING OF OUR LIVES.

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:09.407 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S A GOOD THING.

00:40:07.138 --> 00:40:10.775 region:rollup2
BUT IT COMES AT A COST.

00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:12.543 region:rollup2
AND THEN LASTLY ALL OF THIS

00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:14.312 region:rollup2
HAPPENS AT INCREDIBLE SPEED.

00:40:12.543 --> 00:40:15.880 region:rollup2
THAT IS IN PART BECAUSE WE NOW

00:40:14.312 --> 00:40:17.348 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.816 region:rollup2
OUR MACHINES COMPUTERS

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:20.251 region:rollup2
ALGORITHMS TALK TO OTHER

00:40:18.816 --> 00:40:21.886 region:rollup2
MACHINES

00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:23.588 region:rollup2
AND DEVELOP CHO WOOD.

00:40:21.886 --> 00:40:24.889 region:rollup2
BY THEMSELVES.

00:40:23.588 --> 00:40:26.891 region:rollup2
THAT IS IN IT'S VERY EARLY

00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:28.226 region:rollup2
STAGES NOT EVERY QUARTER IS

00:40:26.891 --> 00:40:30.962 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE DISPLACED.

00:40:28.226 --> 00:40:31.529 region:rollup2
BUT THERE IS A SPEED ELEMENT IN

00:40:30.962 --> 00:40:32.797 region:rollup2
THIS THAT WE NEED TO RECKON

00:40:31.529 --> 00:40:34.465 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:40:32.797 --> 00:40:37.201 region:rollup2
SECONDLY I'LL A LOT OF.

00:40:34.465 --> 00:40:39.837 region:rollup2
THESE NEW A AYE PLATFORMS.

00:40:37.201 --> 00:40:41.406 region:rollup2
ARE OPEN SOURCE.

00:40:39.837 --> 00:40:42.874 region:rollup2
SO WITH THE DEVELOPER COMMUNITY

00:40:41.406 --> 00:40:45.977 region:rollup2
AROUND THE WORLD CAN NOW DEVELOP

00:40:42.874 --> 00:40:48.012 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN APPLICATIONS.

00:40:45.977 --> 00:40:49.981 region:rollup2
PRETTY MUCH FREELY.

00:40:48.012 --> 00:40:51.883 region:rollup2
S. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE MILLIONS

00:40:49.981 --> 00:40:53.451 region:rollup2
OF CODERS NOW TAKING TO THE SAY

00:40:51.883 --> 00:40:55.320 region:rollup2
I APPLICATIONS.

00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:56.554 region:rollup2
WITH WITH NO THINKING NO

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:58.222 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION AS TO WHAT THE

00:40:56.554 --> 00:41:00.391 region:rollup2
SECOND AND THIRD ORDER EFFECTS

00:40:58.222 --> 00:41:02.093 region:rollup2
OF THIS ARE. SO IT'S VERY FAST

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:04.329 region:rollup2
AND YEAH I'M GONNA QUOTE LARRY

00:41:02.093 --> 00:41:05.263 region:rollup2
DOWNES LOFT DISRUPTION HERE THAT

00:41:04.329 --> 00:41:07.098 region:rollup2
SAYS THAT.

00:41:05.263 --> 00:41:08.166 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY ALWAYS CHANGES

00:41:07.098 --> 00:41:10.234 region:rollup2
EXPONENTIALLY.

00:41:08.166 --> 00:41:11.736 region:rollup2
BUT SOCIETY AND POLICY CHANGE

00:41:10.234 --> 00:41:14.005 region:rollup2
INCREMENTALLY.

00:41:11.736 --> 00:41:15.573 region:rollup2
SO SPEED IS REALLY OF THE

00:41:14.005 --> 00:41:17.208 region:rollup2
ESSENCE HERE SPEED OF

00:41:15.573 --> 00:41:18.376 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING AND SPEED OF A

00:41:17.208 --> 00:41:20.311 region:rollup2
SHAPING.

00:41:18.376 --> 00:41:21.679 region:rollup2
.

00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:23.448 region:rollup2
WHY DO I BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA

00:41:21.679 --> 00:41:24.015 region:rollup2
CAN PLAY A A DISTINCT ROLE IN

00:41:23.448 --> 00:41:27.051 region:rollup2
THIS A BECAUSE WE ARE ONE OF

00:41:24.015 --> 00:41:29.087 region:rollup2
THE?

00:41:27.051 --> 00:41:30.922 region:rollup2
HUBS OF INNOVATION AROUND

00:41:29.087 --> 00:41:32.357 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WE

00:41:30.922 --> 00:41:34.058 region:rollup2
BENEFIT FORM IT'S GROSS.

00:41:32.357 --> 00:41:36.394 region:rollup2
BUT COMMENSURATE WITH THAT

00:41:34.058 --> 00:41:37.929 region:rollup2
BENEFIT NEEDS TO BE A SENSE OF

00:41:36.394 --> 00:41:40.498 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY.

00:41:37.929 --> 00:41:42.066 region:rollup2
SECONDLY WE HAVE A LEGACY AND

00:41:40.498 --> 00:41:42.600 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A TRACK RECORD

00:41:42.066 --> 00:41:44.902 region:rollup2
OF.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.304 region:rollup2
BEING HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL ON THE

00:41:44.902 --> 00:41:48.473 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION SIDE.

00:41:46.304 --> 00:41:50.808 region:rollup2
BEING A GROWTH ENGINE FOR THE

00:41:48.473 --> 00:41:52.944 region:rollup2
NATION AND INDEED FOR THE REST

00:41:50.808 --> 00:41:54.312 region:rollup2
OF THE WORLD AND YET BEING VERY

00:41:52.944 --> 00:41:56.047 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE WHEN IT COMES TO

00:41:54.312 --> 00:41:57.715 region:rollup2
SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY

00:41:56.047 --> 00:41:59.650 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S REALLY NO REASON. FOR

00:41:57.715 --> 00:42:00.818 region:rollup2
WHY WE SHOULD SHY AWAY FROM THIS

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:02.954 region:rollup2
CURRENT CHALLENGE.

00:42:00.818 --> 00:42:04.689 region:rollup2
YEAH AND OF COURSE WE ARE THE

00:42:02.954 --> 00:42:07.058 region:rollup2
SIXTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE

00:42:04.689 --> 00:42:07.792 region:rollup2
WORLD TO DATE SO WHAT WE DO SETS

00:42:07.058 --> 00:42:09.894 region:rollup2
TRENDS.

00:42:07.792 --> 00:42:11.529 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONALLY AND IT'S NOT

00:42:09.894 --> 00:42:13.464 region:rollup2
JUST ECONOMICS IT'S ALSO

00:42:11.529 --> 00:42:16.968 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CULTURE THAT.

00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:18.669 region:rollup2
THAT CATCHES ON A GLOBALLY SO

00:42:16.968 --> 00:42:20.004 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A SIGNALLING EFFECT.

00:42:18.669 --> 00:42:21.873 region:rollup2
I WANT TO WRAP THIS INTO GLOBAL

00:42:20.004 --> 00:42:22.840 region:rollup2
CONTEXT THOUGH AND THIS IN THIS

00:42:21.873 --> 00:42:24.509 region:rollup2
VEIN.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:26.978 region:rollup2
WE ARE.

00:42:24.509 --> 00:42:28.413 region:rollup2
ALONGSIDE CHINA I THINK THE

00:42:26.978 --> 00:42:29.480 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE INNOVATION HOTSPOT

00:42:28.413 --> 00:42:30.915 region:rollup2
FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:33.151 region:rollup2
THERE ARE OTHER.

00:42:30.915 --> 00:42:34.819 region:rollup2
U. S. LOCATIONS THAT ARE VERY

00:42:33.151 --> 00:42:37.121 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT BOSTON OF COURSE.

00:42:34.819 --> 00:42:39.257 region:rollup2
PITTSBURGH SEATTLE.

00:42:37.121 --> 00:42:40.858 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT TYPES AS WELL

00:42:39.257 --> 00:42:41.826 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONALLY THERE ARE OTHER

00:42:40.858 --> 00:42:44.295 region:rollup2
HUBS ISRAEL.

00:42:41.826 --> 00:42:45.430 region:rollup2
CANADA AND THE UK GERMANY

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:47.198 region:rollup2
RUSSIA.

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:48.299 region:rollup2
BUT CHINA IS REALLY THE BIG KID

00:42:47.198 --> 00:42:50.301 region:rollup2
ON THE BLOCK WHITE MOD

00:42:48.299 --> 00:42:52.470 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTING THIS I BY NO MEANS

00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:55.173 region:rollup2
ONE TO FALL INTO THE PATTERN OF

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:56.908 region:rollup2
DESCRIBING CHINA AS AN ENEMY.

00:42:55.173 --> 00:42:59.143 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT

00:42:56.908 --> 00:43:01.379 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES IN OUR VALUE SETS

00:42:59.143 --> 00:43:03.081 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE SEEING THIS ACTED OUT

00:43:01.379 --> 00:43:04.282 region:rollup2
AND LIVED OUT AS WE SPEAK.

00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:05.616 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE DO NEED TO AT

00:43:04.282 --> 00:43:07.084 region:rollup2
LEAST UNDERSTAND THOSE BETTER

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:09.787 region:rollup2
AND COME TO GRIPS WITH THEM.

00:43:07.084 --> 00:43:11.456 region:rollup2
CHINA IS INVESTING VERY HEAVILY

00:43:09.787 --> 00:43:12.957 region:rollup2
ON THE PUBLIC SIDE.

00:43:11.456 --> 00:43:13.724 region:rollup2
IT IS HARD TO SAY WHETHER THEY

00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:15.293 region:rollup2
HAVE ALREADY.

00:43:13.724 --> 00:43:18.095 region:rollup2
OUTSPEND US.

00:43:15.293 --> 00:43:19.297 region:rollup2
THEY ARE SPENDING TO CREATE A

00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:21.866 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR A

00:43:19.297 --> 00:43:23.901 region:rollup2
AYE INDUSTRY BY TWENTY THIRTY.

00:43:21.866 --> 00:43:26.671 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE DOING SO VERY

00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:28.439 region:rollup2
OVERTLY AND FOSTERING A PUBLIC

00:43:26.671 --> 00:43:30.775 region:rollup2
SECTOR A PRIVATE SECTOR.

00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:33.010 region:rollup2
R. AND D. AND PRODUCT IS ASIAN.

00:43:30.775 --> 00:43:34.078 region:rollup2
THEY ARE REQUIRING THAT STUDENTS

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:36.714 region:rollup2
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

00:43:34.078 --> 00:43:38.282 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT IN PRIMARY SCHOOL

00:43:36.714 --> 00:43:39.484 region:rollup2
ARE LEARNING HOW TO CODE IN HOW

00:43:38.282 --> 00:43:40.818 region:rollup2
TO DEAL WITH ARTIFICIAL

00:43:39.484 --> 00:43:42.453 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENT NATIONWIDE THAT'S

00:43:40.818 --> 00:43:44.188 region:rollup2
ACROSS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION

00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:45.022 region:rollup2
CHINESE.

00:43:44.188 --> 00:43:47.925 region:rollup2
AND.

00:43:45.022 --> 00:43:48.826 region:rollup2
ARE AND THEY'RE ALSO SETTING UP

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:50.962 region:rollup2
INNOVATION HUBS.

00:43:48.826 --> 00:43:53.664 region:rollup2
TO THE TUNES OF BILLIONS OF

00:43:50.962 --> 00:43:55.600 region:rollup2
DOLLARS AT A TIME REGIONALLY.

00:43:53.664 --> 00:43:56.968 region:rollup2
IT IS HARD TO SAY HOW WE STACK

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:59.170 region:rollup2
UP BECAUSE A LOT OF THE SPENDING

00:43:56.968 --> 00:44:01.372 region:rollup2
ON THE UNITED STATES ASIDE IS.

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:02.507 region:rollup2
CLASSIFIED. AND IT IS DEFENSE

00:44:01.372 --> 00:44:04.242 region:rollup2
SPENDING.

00:44:02.507 --> 00:44:05.676 region:rollup2
I SHOULD HOWEVER NOTE AS YOU'RE

00:44:04.242 --> 00:44:07.111 region:rollup2
ALL AWARE THAT WE ARE

00:44:05.676 --> 00:44:08.713 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLYCUTTING BACK ON

00:44:07.111 --> 00:44:09.580 region:rollup2
SCIENCE FUNDING ON A FEDERAL

00:44:08.713 --> 00:44:12.416 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:14.418 region:rollup2
AND OUR SCIENCE REPRESENTATION.

00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:17.255 region:rollup2
GLOBALLY AS WELL AT A MOMENT

00:44:14.418 --> 00:44:19.624 region:rollup2
WHEN CHINA IS INCREASING BOTH.

00:44:17.255 --> 00:44:21.159 region:rollup2
ON THE DEFENSE SIDE WE HAVE

00:44:19.624 --> 00:44:24.529 region:rollup2
FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT SPENDING.

00:44:21.159 --> 00:44:25.696 region:rollup2
ABOUT SEVEN POINT FOUR BILLION.

00:44:24.529 --> 00:44:27.532 region:rollup2
MOST OF WHICH.

00:44:25.696 --> 00:44:29.033 region:rollup2
IS REAL A SPENT ON.

00:44:27.532 --> 00:44:30.468 region:rollup2
ON.

00:44:29.033 --> 00:44:33.738 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OR

00:44:30.468 --> 00:44:36.374 region:rollup2
RELATED SMART COMPUTING AND.

00:44:33.738 --> 00:44:38.009 region:rollup2
BIG DATA AND CLOUD TECHNOLOGIES.

00:44:36.374 --> 00:44:38.943 region:rollup2
SO ABOUT A THIRD OF THAT I

00:44:38.009 --> 00:44:40.111 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IS ARTIFICIAL

00:44:38.943 --> 00:44:41.445 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE AND OF COURSE

00:44:40.111 --> 00:44:43.581 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT ELSE IS

00:44:41.445 --> 00:44:44.916 region:rollup2
IN THAT A DEFENSE BUDGET BECAUSE

00:44:43.581 --> 00:44:46.617 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT PUBLIC.

00:44:44.916 --> 00:44:48.252 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS SIGNIFICANT

00:44:46.617 --> 00:44:49.654 region:rollup2
SPENDING THEIR ON THE.

00:44:48.252 --> 00:44:51.389 region:rollup2
PRIVATE SECTOR SIDE WE ARE

00:44:49.654 --> 00:44:52.223 region:rollup2
STILL AHEAD.

00:44:51.389 --> 00:44:54.525 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

00:44:52.223 --> 00:44:55.459 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE LEADING INTERNET

00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:57.461 region:rollup2
SERVICE PROVIDERS INTERNET

00:44:55.459 --> 00:44:59.664 region:rollup2
COMPANIES I DON'T REALLY NEED TO

00:44:57.461 --> 00:45:00.831 region:rollup2
MENTION THEM GOOGLE FACEBOOK. OF

00:44:59.664 --> 00:45:03.301 region:rollup2
MICROSOFT OR APPLE.

00:45:00.831 --> 00:45:04.869 region:rollup2
AND OTHERS.

00:45:03.301 --> 00:45:07.738 region:rollup2
BUT THE CHINESE ARE.

00:45:04.869 --> 00:45:09.140 region:rollup2
CLOSING RANKS PRETTY QUICKLY BY

00:45:07.738 --> 00:45:10.841 region:rollup2
DO ALI BABA TENSE AND.

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:12.143 region:rollup2
ARE CHINESE LEADERS AT THIS

00:45:10.841 --> 00:45:14.412 region:rollup2
POINT BUT ARE BEING PROMOTED TO

00:45:12.143 --> 00:45:15.880 region:rollup2
GO GLOBAL FAIRLY QUICKLY NOW AND

00:45:14.412 --> 00:45:17.281 region:rollup2
WITH CHINA'S INVESTMENT AROUND

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:18.883 region:rollup2
THE WORLD AND INFRASTRUCTURE A

00:45:17.281 --> 00:45:21.285 region:rollup2
LOT OF THE INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES

00:45:18.883 --> 00:45:23.054 region:rollup2
WILL RIDE ON THE BACK. OF THOSE

00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:23.888 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:45:23.054 --> 00:45:25.456 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES.

00:45:23.888 --> 00:45:27.124 region:rollup2
CHINA HAS SOME OTHER ADVANTAGES

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:28.893 region:rollup2
SUCH AS VERY HEAVY MOBILE

00:45:27.124 --> 00:45:30.861 region:rollup2
PENETRATION ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED

00:45:28.893 --> 00:45:32.363 region:rollup2
MILLION MOBILE DATA USERS. THAT

00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:33.831 region:rollup2
ARE FRANKLY.

00:45:32.363 --> 00:45:34.765 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT MORE PROFICIENT.

00:45:33.831 --> 00:45:35.566 region:rollup2
AND.

00:45:34.765 --> 00:45:37.835 region:rollup2
AND.

00:45:35.566 --> 00:45:39.070 region:rollup2
MORE EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH

00:45:37.835 --> 00:45:40.838 region:rollup2
DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES ON THE

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:43.341 region:rollup2
MOBILE HANDSETS IN EVERY SINGLE

00:45:40.838 --> 00:45:45.643 region:rollup2
ASPECT OF THEIR LIVES WECHAT IS

00:45:43.341 --> 00:45:47.712 region:rollup2
ONLY ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT.

00:45:45.643 --> 00:45:48.946 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE VERY ACCEPTING OF

00:45:47.712 --> 00:45:50.681 region:rollup2
THAT PENETRATION IN THEIR LIVES.

00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:52.016 region:rollup2
.

00:45:50.681 --> 00:45:53.651 region:rollup2
LAST BUT NOT LEAST CHINESE

00:45:52.016 --> 00:45:55.620 region:rollup2
RESEARCHERS HAVE RECENTLY

00:45:53.651 --> 00:45:57.655 region:rollup2
OVERTAKING U. S. RESEARCHERS

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:59.156 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO THE NUMBER OF.

00:45:57.655 --> 00:46:01.258 region:rollup2
OF ARTICLES AND PAPERS

00:45:59.156 --> 00:46:01.659 region:rollup2
PUBLISHED.

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:03.894 region:rollup2
SO.

00:46:01.659 --> 00:46:05.429 region:rollup2
WE ARE DEALING WITH A

00:46:03.894 --> 00:46:07.198 region:rollup2
FORMIDABLE.

00:46:05.429 --> 00:46:09.634 region:rollup2
FORMIDABLE PARTNER AND

00:46:07.198 --> 00:46:12.470 region:rollup2
COMPETITOR ON A GLOBAL SCALE.

00:46:09.634 --> 00:46:14.572 region:rollup2
CHINA IS ALSO INVESTING CO

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:17.008 region:rollup2
INVESTING WITH US I SHOULD SAY

00:46:14.572 --> 00:46:18.976 region:rollup2
YEAH I'M HERE AND I THINGS LIKE

00:46:17.008 --> 00:46:20.845 region:rollup2
THE NEW DOMMEL ACADEMY AT STANDS

00:46:18.976 --> 00:46:21.679 region:rollup2
FOR DISCOVERY ADVENTURE MOMENTUM

00:46:20.845 --> 00:46:23.247 region:rollup2
IN OUTLOOK.

00:46:21.679 --> 00:46:25.683 region:rollup2
ALI BABA I SPENDING FIFTEEN

00:46:23.247 --> 00:46:26.851 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS ON PARTNERSHIPS

00:46:25.683 --> 00:46:28.719 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:46:26.851 --> 00:46:32.556 region:rollup2
ENCOMPASS ALSO.

00:46:28.719 --> 00:46:35.526 region:rollup2
A. S. U. S. YOU VARIOUS U. S..

00:46:32.556 --> 00:46:36.527 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS AND ACTORS.

00:46:35.526 --> 00:46:38.062 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:46:36.527 --> 00:46:41.198 region:rollup2
THAT ALSO INCLUDE CALIFORNIANS

00:46:38.062 --> 00:46:42.466 region:rollup2
TO XIN SUCH AS A UC BERKELEY IN

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:44.602 region:rollup2
ORDER TO DEVELOP TALENT.

00:46:42.466 --> 00:46:46.037 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS A THERE ARE A LOT

00:46:44.602 --> 00:46:47.204 region:rollup2
OF ASPECTS IN THIS WHERE WE ARE

00:46:46.037 --> 00:46:48.339 region:rollup2
TIED BY THE HIP AND TALENT IS

00:46:47.204 --> 00:46:49.440 region:rollup2
ONE OF THEM.

00:46:48.339 --> 00:46:51.609 region:rollup2
SO THE KEY QUESTIONS ARE WILL

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:53.344 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE OF AMERICAN GLOBALLY

00:46:51.609 --> 00:46:55.079 region:rollup2
I DEVELOPMENT CONTINUE TO EMERGE

00:46:53.344 --> 00:46:56.447 region:rollup2
FROM CALIFORNIA.

00:46:55.079 --> 00:46:57.648 region:rollup2
WILL IT EMERGE FROM CHINA

00:46:56.447 --> 00:46:59.350 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY OR WILL IT BE A

00:46:57.648 --> 00:47:01.352 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP.

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:02.787 region:rollup2
I LIKE TO LOOK AT THIS THROUGH

00:47:01.352 --> 00:47:04.255 region:rollup2
THREE LENSES THE FIRST ONE IS

00:47:02.787 --> 00:47:05.923 region:rollup2
POWER THE SECOND THIS PURPOSE

00:47:04.255 --> 00:47:07.391 region:rollup2
AND THE THIRD IS POSITION.

00:47:05.923 --> 00:47:09.260 region:rollup2
I GUESS WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH

00:47:07.391 --> 00:47:10.961 region:rollup2
POSITION LAST. A BECAUSE

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.129 region:rollup2
POSITION IS REALLY STRATEGY AND

00:47:10.961 --> 00:47:13.431 region:rollup2
POLICY AND THAT'S FOR THE LAST

00:47:12.129 --> 00:47:15.266 region:rollup2
PANEL.

00:47:13.431 --> 00:47:17.201 region:rollup2
POWERS MOSTLY ARTICULATED

00:47:15.266 --> 00:47:19.103 region:rollup2
THROUGH ECONOMICS.

00:47:17.201 --> 00:47:20.805 region:rollup2
AND THERE OF COURSE WE HAVE

00:47:19.103 --> 00:47:23.174 region:rollup2
SEEN MANY STUDIES HOW.

00:47:20.805 --> 00:47:25.176 region:rollup2
A AYE OR AND ROBOTICS

00:47:23.174 --> 00:47:26.711 region:rollup2
AUTOMATION READ LARGE WILL

00:47:25.176 --> 00:47:28.612 region:rollup2
REPLACE DISPLACED LABOR.

00:47:26.711 --> 00:47:29.947 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SEEN DIFFERENT FIGURES

00:47:28.612 --> 00:47:32.183 region:rollup2
OUT THERE RANGING FROM SIXTEEN

00:47:29.947 --> 00:47:34.151 region:rollup2
PERCENT TO FORTY SIX PERCENT.

00:47:32.183 --> 00:47:36.520 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO HEAR

00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:36.687 region:rollup2
FROM MCKINSEY LATER ON IN THE

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.488 region:rollup2
DAY.

00:47:36.687 --> 00:47:39.123 region:rollup2
.

00:47:37.488 --> 00:47:40.458 region:rollup2
WE HAD BERKELEY WHICH BELIEVES

00:47:39.123 --> 00:47:42.059 region:rollup2
THAT THE PICTURE IS A BIT MORE

00:47:40.458 --> 00:47:43.994 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATED WE NEED TO LOOK

00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:45.563 region:rollup2
AT THIS ON A TASK AND JOB

00:47:43.994 --> 00:47:47.498 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC BASIS.

00:47:45.563 --> 00:47:49.500 region:rollup2
A I WILL BE PERVASIVE THROUGHOUT

00:47:47.498 --> 00:47:51.602 region:rollup2
ALMOST EVERY JOB THE QUESTION IS

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:53.170 region:rollup2
WHAT PART OF A GIVEN JOB AT THE

00:47:51.602 --> 00:47:54.505 region:rollup2
MOMENT WILL IT DISPLACE OR

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:55.940 region:rollup2
CHANGING HOW DISRUPTIVE WILL

00:47:54.505 --> 00:47:57.274 region:rollup2
THAT BE.

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:59.376 region:rollup2
THEY ARE OPTIMISTIC.

00:47:57.274 --> 00:48:00.578 region:rollup2
QUOTES HERE THAT SAY THAT WE

00:47:59.376 --> 00:48:02.580 region:rollup2
COULD BE LOOKING AT SOMETHING

00:48:00.578 --> 00:48:04.548 region:rollup2
LIKE THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:05.816 region:rollup2
REVENUE INCREASE FOR GLOBAL

00:48:04.548 --> 00:48:07.418 region:rollup2
CORPORATIONS THAT'S.

00:48:05.816 --> 00:48:09.353 region:rollup2
MULTI TRILLION DOLLAR OF REVENUE

00:48:07.418 --> 00:48:10.988 region:rollup2
INCREASES IN TOTAL AROUND THE

00:48:09.353 --> 00:48:12.390 region:rollup2
WORLD AND THAT WE MIGHT SEE AS

00:48:10.988 --> 00:48:14.191 region:rollup2
MUCH AS A TEN PERCENT INCREASE

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:15.659 region:rollup2
IN FACT IN EMPLOYMENT.

00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:17.428 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO THERE'S THERE'S A LOT

00:48:15.659 --> 00:48:18.229 region:rollup2
OF UPSIDE HERE THAT WE ALSO

00:48:17.428 --> 00:48:19.864 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT IGNORE.

00:48:18.229 --> 00:48:21.265 region:rollup2
.

00:48:19.864 --> 00:48:22.266 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES LOOK AT THIS

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:22.933 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENTLY AROUND THE

00:48:22.266 --> 00:48:24.602 region:rollup2
WORLD.

00:48:22.933 --> 00:48:26.971 region:rollup2
JAPAN IS NOT AFRAID OF THIS

00:48:24.602 --> 00:48:27.671 region:rollup2
BECAUSE JAPAN IS IN FACT A DYING

00:48:26.971 --> 00:48:28.572 region:rollup2
NATION.

00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:30.441 region:rollup2
THE.

00:48:28.572 --> 00:48:32.510 region:rollup2
THE BIRTH RATETHAT DOES NOT

00:48:30.441 --> 00:48:34.245 region:rollup2
SUSTAIN THE ECONOMY THEIR OUT OF

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:35.379 region:rollup2
WORKERS AND SO THEY WELL VERY

00:48:34.245 --> 00:48:36.714 region:rollup2
MUCH WELCOME ARTIFICIAL

00:48:35.379 --> 00:48:39.083 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE AND ROBOTS AND IN

00:48:36.714 --> 00:48:40.518 region:rollup2
FACT VERY HUMANOID ROBOTS.

00:48:39.083 --> 00:48:41.952 region:rollup2
GERMANY FOR INSTANCE IN THE

00:48:40.518 --> 00:48:43.721 region:rollup2
NORDIC COUNTRIES ARE LOOKING AT

00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:45.289 region:rollup2
THIS IN A VERY INTEGRATED.

00:48:43.721 --> 00:48:47.792 region:rollup2
WAY. OF.

00:48:45.289 --> 00:48:49.460 region:rollup2
USING A AYE TO FACILITATE LABOR

00:48:47.792 --> 00:48:50.528 region:rollup2
A VERY COLLABORATIVE STANCE WITH

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:51.829 region:rollup2
LABOR UNIONS.

00:48:50.528 --> 00:48:53.097 region:rollup2
AND I THINK A BIT OF A ROLE

00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:54.331 region:rollup2
MODEL FOR US IF YOU DON'T MIND

00:48:53.097 --> 00:48:56.066 region:rollup2
MY SAYING SO.

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:57.468 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY HAVE FOUND OUT

00:48:56.066 --> 00:48:58.803 region:rollup2
THAT THE JOIN PRODUCTIVITY

00:48:57.468 --> 00:48:59.904 region:rollup2
BETWEEN A AYE INCREASES THE

00:48:58.803 --> 00:49:02.706 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVITY AND HUMAN

00:48:59.904 --> 00:49:04.074 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES IS EVEN

00:49:02.706 --> 00:49:06.744 region:rollup2
HIGHER WHEN SEEN JOINTLY.

00:49:04.074 --> 00:49:09.079 region:rollup2
SO THESE ARE JUST A COUPLE OF

00:49:06.744 --> 00:49:11.215 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES OF THE SPECTRUM

00:49:09.079 --> 00:49:12.583 region:rollup2
GLOBALLY WE'RE ALSO SEEING VERY

00:49:11.215 --> 00:49:14.218 region:rollup2
PROMISING INNOVATION AROUND THE

00:49:12.583 --> 00:49:14.718 region:rollup2
WORLD IN SPACES WHERE YOU

00:49:14.218 --> 00:49:16.987 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T HAVE.

00:49:14.718 --> 00:49:18.622 region:rollup2
EXPECTED THEM SUCH AS.

00:49:16.987 --> 00:49:22.560 region:rollup2
IT AS SUCH AS.

00:49:18.622 --> 00:49:24.795 region:rollup2
NIGERIA INDONESIA OF RUSSIA.

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:26.564 region:rollup2
AND WE CAN DIVE INTO THAT SOME

00:49:24.795 --> 00:49:28.532 region:rollup2
MORE IN CUBA NAY IF YOU LIKE.

00:49:26.564 --> 00:49:30.134 region:rollup2
THERE ARE RISKS AND.

00:49:28.532 --> 00:49:31.635 region:rollup2
CHANGES TO SOCIETY WE CAN'T

00:49:30.134 --> 00:49:32.703 region:rollup2
IGNORE.

00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:34.271 region:rollup2
AND.

00:49:32.703 --> 00:49:36.006 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I WANT TO JUST

00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:37.341 region:rollup2
OUTLINED A FEW PRIVACY OF COURSE

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:38.843 region:rollup2
IS ONE OF THEM.

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:41.078 region:rollup2
WE HAVE LEADING IN OF

00:49:38.843 --> 00:49:42.613 region:rollup2
INNOVATORS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:49:41.078 --> 00:49:43.981 region:rollup2
SUCH AS WE BOUGHT FOR INSTANCE

00:49:42.613 --> 00:49:45.483 region:rollup2
FOR PSYCHOTHERAPY.

00:49:43.981 --> 00:49:47.485 region:rollup2
VERY SUCCESSFULLY USING.

00:49:45.483 --> 00:49:49.186 region:rollup2
DIGITAL CBT.

00:49:47.485 --> 00:49:50.888 region:rollup2
COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL

00:49:49.186 --> 00:49:52.456 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATION AS PART OF

00:49:50.888 --> 00:49:53.791 region:rollup2
FACEBOOK FOR INSTANCE AND

00:49:52.456 --> 00:49:55.559 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO GREAT LENGTHS.

00:49:53.791 --> 00:49:56.293 region:rollup2
GUY TRYING TO PROTECT THEIR

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:58.095 region:rollup2
DATA.

00:49:56.293 --> 00:49:59.530 region:rollup2
WE WILL HAVE TO SEE WHETHER

00:49:58.095 --> 00:50:01.131 region:rollup2
THAT GOES FOR EVERYBODY IN THIS

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:03.167 region:rollup2
FIELD BUT I THINK THAT IS A.

00:50:01.131 --> 00:50:04.401 region:rollup2
THAT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT

00:50:03.167 --> 00:50:06.437 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD BE LIKE.

00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:08.405 region:rollup2
I TRANSPARENCY.

00:50:06.437 --> 00:50:09.640 region:rollup2
WHEN FACEBOOK TELLS US THAT FROM

00:50:08.405 --> 00:50:11.208 region:rollup2
NOW ON THE USING FACIAL

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:13.110 region:rollup2
RECOGNITION SOFTWARE.

00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:14.144 region:rollup2
TO ENHANCE OUR EXPERIENCE ON

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:15.513 region:rollup2
FACEBOOK WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT

00:50:14.144 --> 00:50:16.747 region:rollup2
MEAN.

00:50:15.513 --> 00:50:18.282 region:rollup2
I COULD ALWAYS HAVE MY FACE A

00:50:16.747 --> 00:50:19.617 region:rollup2
TRACED

00:50:18.282 --> 00:50:20.451 region:rollup2
A BECAUSE IT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:50:19.617 --> 00:50:22.853 region:rollup2
MY NAME.

00:50:20.451 --> 00:50:24.521 region:rollup2
THIS INCREASED CAPABILITY WILL

00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:26.624 region:rollup2
IT NOW BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND MY

00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:29.026 region:rollup2
MOOD IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS.

00:50:26.624 --> 00:50:32.263 region:rollup2
WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE AROUND ME I

00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:32.263 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW AND I THINK WE SHOULD

00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:36.467 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND

00:50:34.999 --> 00:50:37.935 region:rollup2
BECOME MORE TRANSPARENT ABOUT

00:50:36.467 --> 00:50:40.404 region:rollup2
WHAT THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED

00:50:37.935 --> 00:50:41.772 region:rollup2
FOR. AND TO SOME DEGREE WE NEED

00:50:40.404 --> 00:50:44.141 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THE MORE EXPLAINABLE

00:50:41.772 --> 00:50:44.808 region:rollup2
RIGHT WE HAVE A DARPA INVESTING

00:50:44.141 --> 00:50:47.177 region:rollup2
HEAVILY IN.

00:50:44.808 --> 00:50:49.246 region:rollup2
A I EXPLAINED ABILITY USING ONE

00:50:47.177 --> 00:50:50.714 region:rollup2
TOP OF A AYE TO EXPLAIN ANOTHER

00:50:49.246 --> 00:50:52.449 region:rollup2
TAPE TYPE OF A AYE.

00:50:50.714 --> 00:50:53.784 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S HOW COMPLEX IT IS

00:50:52.449 --> 00:50:56.220 region:rollup2
TODAY BECAUSE SOME OF THESE

00:50:53.784 --> 00:50:58.088 region:rollup2
MODELS ARE GET REALLY REALLY.

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:59.390 region:rollup2
REALLY REALLY COMPLEX AND HARD

00:50:58.088 --> 00:51:01.292 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND.

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:03.727 region:rollup2
WE OF COURSE HAVE THE LAPD THE

00:51:01.292 --> 00:51:06.330 region:rollup2
NYPD USING PREDICTIVE TO.

00:51:03.727 --> 00:51:08.332 region:rollup2
ANALYTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING

00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:09.066 region:rollup2
AND OTHER A AYE TECHNOLOGIES IN

00:51:08.332 --> 00:51:11.936 region:rollup2
ORDER TO.

00:51:09.066 --> 00:51:13.437 region:rollup2
SECURE OR SAFER NEIGHBORHOODS

00:51:11.936 --> 00:51:14.838 region:rollup2
AND FOR PREDICTIVE POLICING. AND

00:51:13.437 --> 00:51:16.340 region:rollup2
WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT IS BEING

00:51:14.838 --> 00:51:18.008 region:rollup2
FOUGHT OUT IN COURT RIGHT NOW

00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:19.343 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SOME OF THESE ALGORITHMS

00:51:18.008 --> 00:51:21.278 region:rollup2
CAN'T REALLY TELL YOU WHY YOUR

00:51:19.343 --> 00:51:23.047 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOOD WAS IDENTIFIED AS

00:51:21.278 --> 00:51:25.282 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY. RISKY AND A

00:51:23.047 --> 00:51:28.485 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES FEEL STIGMATIZED.

00:51:25.282 --> 00:51:30.588 region:rollup2
SO SO EXPLAINED ABILITY IS A A

00:51:28.485 --> 00:51:33.057 region:rollup2
BIG PROBLEM AND WE NEED TO

00:51:30.588 --> 00:51:34.692 region:rollup2
DEMAND MORE OF IT BUT WE NEED TO

00:51:33.057 --> 00:51:36.427 region:rollup2
BE VERY DIFFERENTIATED.

00:51:34.692 --> 00:51:38.996 region:rollup2
APPLICATION AREA BY APPLICATION

00:51:36.427 --> 00:51:41.532 region:rollup2
AREA LEST WE WANT TO HAVE VERY

00:51:38.996 --> 00:51:44.301 region:rollup2
GENERAL OVER ARCHING REGULATION

00:51:41.532 --> 00:51:46.303 region:rollup2
SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN. UNION.

00:51:44.301 --> 00:51:47.004 region:rollup2
DATA PROTECTION DIRECTIVE THAT

00:51:46.303 --> 00:51:49.039 region:rollup2
WAS JUST.

00:51:47.004 --> 00:51:50.507 region:rollup2
RELEASED AND IS COMING TO

00:51:49.039 --> 00:51:52.443 region:rollup2
FRUITION THIS YEAR.

00:51:50.507 --> 00:51:53.043 region:rollup2
WHICH AS INNOVATORS AROUND THE

00:51:52.443 --> 00:51:54.645 region:rollup2
WORLD.

00:51:53.043 --> 00:51:56.714 region:rollup2
VERY RETICENT

00:51:54.645 --> 00:51:57.615 region:rollup2
TO INVEST IN EUROPE BECAUSE THEY

00:51:56.714 --> 00:51:59.583 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO BE SLAPPED WITH

00:51:57.615 --> 00:52:01.418 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR FINES SO I THINK

00:51:59.583 --> 00:52:03.320 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO BE A BIT MORE NUANCED

00:52:01.418 --> 00:52:05.089 region:rollup2
AND APPLICATION SPECIFIC.

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:07.358 region:rollup2
THEN THERE IS THE AREA OF AGENCY

00:52:05.089 --> 00:52:09.727 region:rollup2
WHICH IS PERSONAL CHOICE.

00:52:07.358 --> 00:52:11.261 region:rollup2
AM I BEING NARROWED IN MY CHOICE

00:52:09.727 --> 00:52:13.197 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ALGORITHMS FIGURE OUT

00:52:11.261 --> 00:52:14.898 region:rollup2
WHO I AM. AND THEY FIGURE OUT

00:52:13.197 --> 00:52:16.333 region:rollup2
WHAT I AM ATTRACTED TO YOU AND

00:52:14.898 --> 00:52:18.135 region:rollup2
THEY KEEP ME ON THAT TRAJECTORY

00:52:16.333 --> 00:52:20.004 region:rollup2
ALWAYS SPEEDING ME MORE CONTENT

00:52:18.135 --> 00:52:22.106 region:rollup2
MORE RELATIONSHIPS MORE PRODUCTS

00:52:20.004 --> 00:52:23.440 region:rollup2
AND SERVICES THAT ARE PLAYING

00:52:22.106 --> 00:52:25.275 region:rollup2
INTO WHO I AM TODAY.

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:26.744 region:rollup2
Y. WAS YESTERDAY.

00:52:25.275 --> 00:52:28.612 region:rollup2
OR WILL A AYE ENABLE ME TO

00:52:26.744 --> 00:52:30.914 region:rollup2
EXPAND MY HORIZONS AND MY SET OF

00:52:28.612 --> 00:52:33.550 region:rollup2
CHOICES IN WAYS THAT I HAVEN'T

00:52:30.914 --> 00:52:35.085 region:rollup2
BEEN ABLE TO ENJOY BEFORE THAT

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:37.888 region:rollup2
IS A VERY BIG QUESTION.

00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:38.489 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED.

00:52:37.888 --> 00:52:40.991 region:rollup2
SO.

00:52:38.489 --> 00:52:44.762 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE THE SOCIETAL

00:52:40.991 --> 00:52:46.797 region:rollup2
ISSUES NOT TO MENTION SAFETY AND

00:52:44.762 --> 00:52:48.499 region:rollup2
SECURITY OF COURSE WE'VE TALKED

00:52:46.797 --> 00:52:50.701 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT IN A AYE ABOUT.

00:52:48.499 --> 00:52:52.703 region:rollup2
ACCIDENT PREVENTION ABOUT

00:52:50.701 --> 00:52:54.071 region:rollup2
MORALLY DICEY SITUATIONS YOU

00:52:52.703 --> 00:52:55.272 region:rollup2
PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT THE TROLLEY

00:52:54.071 --> 00:52:56.140 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

00:52:55.272 --> 00:52:58.442 region:rollup2
HOW DOES IT AUTONOMOUS

00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:59.943 region:rollup2
AUTOMOBILE OR THE A AYE IN IT OR

00:52:58.442 --> 00:53:02.012 region:rollup2
IN THE NETWORK THAT GOVERNS IT?

00:52:59.943 --> 00:53:04.448 region:rollup2
DECIDE WHEN TO.

00:53:02.012 --> 00:53:06.016 region:rollup2
HIT A DOG IN THE ROAD OR A TREE

00:53:04.448 --> 00:53:07.684 region:rollup2
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

00:53:06.016 --> 00:53:09.319 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE IDEALLY

00:53:07.684 --> 00:53:11.522 region:rollup2
AUTOMAKERS WILL KEEP US OUT OF

00:53:09.319 --> 00:53:13.390 region:rollup2
THAT SITUATION TO BEGIN WITH BUT

00:53:11.522 --> 00:53:15.092 region:rollup2
THERE MAY BE OF MARGINAL

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:15.859 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS WHERE THAT BECOMES

00:53:15.092 --> 00:53:17.928 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT.

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:19.797 region:rollup2
WE ALSO NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO

00:53:17.928 --> 00:53:21.398 region:rollup2
AUTHENTICITY AND VERACITY IN

00:53:19.797 --> 00:53:22.966 region:rollup2
SOCIETY AND THAT IS BEING

00:53:21.398 --> 00:53:25.035 region:rollup2
THREATENED AS WE ALL KNOW.

00:53:22.966 --> 00:53:26.937 region:rollup2
EH THROUGH.

00:53:25.035 --> 00:53:28.772 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

00:53:26.937 --> 00:53:30.074 region:rollup2
MANIPULATIVE ACTORS ON OUR

00:53:28.772 --> 00:53:31.809 region:rollup2
SOCIAL MEDIA WE'RE NOW SEEING

00:53:30.074 --> 00:53:34.244 region:rollup2
THE EMERGENCE OF WHAT I WOULD

00:53:31.809 --> 00:53:36.180 region:rollup2
CALL DEEP FAKE ACTORS.

00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:37.815 region:rollup2
THAT ARE NOT REAL THAT ARE

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:39.316 region:rollup2
PRETENDING TO BE.

00:53:37.815 --> 00:53:40.350 region:rollup2
TO BE IN DECISION MAKING

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:42.586 region:rollup2
PROCESS SEIZE.

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:45.322 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE A PROBLEM FOR HOW

00:53:42.586 --> 00:53:46.657 region:rollup2
WE TRANSACT IN HOW WE ENACT

00:53:45.322 --> 00:53:49.226 region:rollup2
DIPLOMACY FOR INSTANCE.

00:53:46.657 --> 00:53:52.162 region:rollup2
A SO THESE ARE ALL AREAS THAT

00:53:49.226 --> 00:53:53.564 region:rollup2
IMPACT OUR SOCIETAL FABRICTHAT

00:53:52.162 --> 00:53:56.033 region:rollup2
IMPACT HOW WE LIVE TRUSTS.

00:53:53.564 --> 00:53:58.435 region:rollup2
TRUST TO ME IS THE MOST

00:53:56.033 --> 00:54:00.871 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT CURRENCY IN SOCIETY.

00:53:58.435 --> 00:54:02.473 region:rollup2
AND TRUST WILL.

00:54:00.871 --> 00:54:04.541 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHETHER WE AS

00:54:02.473 --> 00:54:06.410 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WILL THRIVE WHETHER

00:54:04.541 --> 00:54:09.079 region:rollup2
WE WILL BE TORN APART. AND WE

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:10.781 region:rollup2
HAVE SEEN MUCH OF THIS HAPPENED

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:12.716 region:rollup2
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS A

00:54:10.781 --> 00:54:13.917 region:rollup2
IN OUR SOCIETY.

00:54:12.716 --> 00:54:15.319 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED TO GET AHEAD OF THIS

00:54:13.917 --> 00:54:17.221 region:rollup2
OUR AND MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:54:15.319 --> 00:54:17.855 region:rollup2
MACHINE.

00:54:17.221 --> 00:54:19.089 region:rollup2
SILICATES THAT HE AYE

00:54:17.855 --> 00:54:21.391 region:rollup2
FACILITATES OUR HUMAN FABRIC OUR

00:54:19.089 --> 00:54:22.860 region:rollup2
TRUST OUR PROSPERITY BUT NOT

00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:25.262 region:rollup2
JUSTPROSPERITY IN TERMS OF

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:26.096 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. ALSO IN

00:54:25.262 --> 00:54:28.031 region:rollup2
TERMS OF HUMAN GROWTH AND HUMAN

00:54:26.096 --> 00:54:28.832 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT.

00:54:28.031 --> 00:54:30.767 region:rollup2
THE MACHINE NEEDS TO FACILITATE

00:54:28.832 --> 00:54:35.372 region:rollup2
US A. I. NEEDS TO FACILITATE US

00:54:30.767 --> 00:54:36.440 region:rollup2
IT SHOULDN'T WE SHOULDN'T SERVE

00:54:35.372 --> 00:54:36.874 region:rollup2
A AYE RIGHT. I THINK THAT'S

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:37.875 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO KNOW.

00:54:36.874 --> 00:54:40.711 region:rollup2
SO AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS

00:54:37.875 --> 00:54:41.245 region:rollup2
SHOULD ABOUT A BE ABOUT US

00:54:40.711 --> 00:54:43.180 region:rollup2
CREATING A BETTER SOCIETY

00:54:41.245 --> 00:54:44.481 region:rollup2
SOLVING SOCIETY'S PROBLEMS

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:46.183 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN BEING RUN BY THE

00:54:44.481 --> 00:54:48.218 region:rollup2
MACHINES AND I THINK THERE'S A

00:54:46.183 --> 00:54:50.053 region:rollup2
REAL. POTENTIAL FOR THAT TO

00:54:48.218 --> 00:54:52.589 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN A REAL PARTNERSHIP.

00:54:50.053 --> 00:54:54.458 region:rollup2
A ICE HERE TO STAY. IT IS

00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:55.392 region:rollup2
OVERHEATED THERE IS A BUBBLE.

00:54:54.458 --> 00:54:55.959 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY

00:54:55.392 --> 00:54:58.996 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DOT COM

00:54:55.959 --> 00:55:00.063 region:rollup2
BUST.

00:54:58.996 --> 00:55:01.532 region:rollup2
I THINK WHAT WE WOULD HAVE TO

00:55:00.063 --> 00:55:03.167 region:rollup2
CONCLUDE IS THAT YES WE OVER

00:55:01.532 --> 00:55:05.469 region:rollup2
HEATED THE BUBBLE BURST BUT THE

00:55:03.167 --> 00:55:06.703 region:rollup2
INTERNET WAS HERE TO STAY.

00:55:05.469 --> 00:55:08.405 region:rollup2
IT IS STILL HERE TO STAY.

00:55:06.703 --> 00:55:10.207 region:rollup2
AND IT IS MORE PERVASIVE THAN

00:55:08.405 --> 00:55:12.976 region:rollup2
EVER AND I BELIEVE A I WILL GO

00:55:10.207 --> 00:55:13.710 region:rollup2
THROUGH A SIMILAR CYCLE.

00:55:12.976 --> 00:55:15.212 region:rollup2
THE POTENTIAL FOR CHANGE

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:16.446 region:rollup2
POSITIVE CHANGE IS A VAST.

00:55:15.212 --> 00:55:17.848 region:rollup2
IF WE SHAPE IT AND GET AHEAD OF

00:55:16.446 --> 00:55:19.416 region:rollup2
IT.

00:55:17.848 --> 00:55:20.951 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

00:55:19.416 --> 00:55:22.719 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH UPPER PHOTOGRAPH A

00:55:20.951 --> 00:55:23.821 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THAT LIKE TO OPEN A FULL

00:55:22.719 --> 00:55:24.321 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

00:55:23.821 --> 00:55:26.123 region:rollup2
ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO ASK

00:55:24.321 --> 00:55:26.657 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

00:55:26.123 --> 00:55:28.325 region:rollup2
LET ME START OFF WITH MY

00:55:26.657 --> 00:55:30.427 region:rollup2
QUESTION EARLIER YOU TALKED

00:55:28.325 --> 00:55:31.495 region:rollup2
ABOUT BIG DATA ARE YOU KNOW JUST

00:55:30.427 --> 00:55:32.696 region:rollup2
WONDERING WHAT KIND OF DATA IS

00:55:31.495 --> 00:55:34.364 region:rollup2
BEING COLLECTED BY ALL THESE

00:55:32.696 --> 00:55:36.033 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES AND WHETHER

00:55:34.364 --> 00:55:38.735 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THE APPLICATION MAY BE.

00:55:36.033 --> 00:55:40.971 region:rollup2
SO ODD EASIER ONE COMMON THEME

00:55:38.735 --> 00:55:43.040 region:rollup2
IS THERE ONCE ONE COMMENTS

00:55:40.971 --> 00:55:44.575 region:rollup2
SORTED DATA HAS BEEN COLLECTED

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:45.509 region:rollup2
BY BY THESE.

00:55:44.575 --> 00:55:47.511 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES

00:55:45.509 --> 00:55:49.479 region:rollup2
WHATSOEVER. YET TO GO TO TO

00:55:47.511 --> 00:55:50.948 region:rollup2
DESCRIBE IT BROADLY WHAT.

00:55:49.479 --> 00:55:52.616 region:rollup2
.

00:55:50.948 --> 00:55:54.418 region:rollup2
WHAT'S MOST VALUABLE IS WHAT'S

00:55:52.616 --> 00:55:55.552 region:rollup2
CALLED LIFE PATTERN DATA.

00:55:54.418 --> 00:55:57.921 region:rollup2
SO DATA THAT.

00:55:55.552 --> 00:55:59.256 region:rollup2
SPEAKS TO YOUR LIFE PATTERN TO

00:55:57.921 --> 00:56:00.357 region:rollup2
YOUR PERSONALITY TWO YOUR

00:55:59.256 --> 00:56:01.992 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT.

00:56:00.357 --> 00:56:04.294 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

00:56:01.992 --> 00:56:05.462 region:rollup2
THE STRUCTURE OF YOUR LIFE.

00:56:04.294 --> 00:56:07.264 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S MOST

00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:07.898 region:rollup2
VALUABLE TO YOU.

00:56:07.264 --> 00:56:09.600 region:rollup2
AND.

00:56:07.898 --> 00:56:11.134 region:rollup2
THAT IS OF COURSE THEN THE

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:14.404 region:rollup2
HIGHEST VALUE BECAUSE IF A

00:56:11.134 --> 00:56:16.874 region:rollup2
COMPANY CONSERVE SERVICES INTO

00:56:14.404 --> 00:56:17.374 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS PICTURE. TAKING

00:56:16.874 --> 00:56:19.676 region:rollup2
COMMAND.

00:56:17.374 --> 00:56:20.978 region:rollup2
MONEY. HIGHER PRICES AND WE

00:56:19.676 --> 00:56:21.545 region:rollup2
LIKE IT AND IT'S ENRICHES OUR

00:56:20.978 --> 00:56:23.213 region:rollup2
LIVES.

00:56:21.545 --> 00:56:25.449 region:rollup2
OUR LIVES

00:56:23.213 --> 00:56:26.483 region:rollup2
SO LIFE PATTERN DATA IS REALLY

00:56:25.449 --> 00:56:27.885 region:rollup2
THE MOVEMENT PATTERN THE SOCIAL

00:56:26.483 --> 00:56:29.553 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE.

00:56:27.885 --> 00:56:30.354 region:rollup2
THE RELATIONSHIPS IS REALLY

00:56:29.553 --> 00:56:32.656 region:rollup2
WHERE MOST OF THE.

00:56:30.354 --> 00:56:34.491 region:rollup2
WITH MOST OF THE VALUE IS.

00:56:32.656 --> 00:56:35.559 region:rollup2
ADDED ARE YOU ALSO TALKED A

00:56:34.491 --> 00:56:37.227 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEIR WHAT THE

00:56:35.559 --> 00:56:38.996 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING WHEN

00:56:37.227 --> 00:56:40.497 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO FUNDING.

00:56:38.996 --> 00:56:42.232 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHETHER THE FUNDING

00:56:40.497 --> 00:56:44.901 region:rollup2
ARE IS BEING ALLOCATED TO DEFEND

00:56:42.232 --> 00:56:46.570 region:rollup2
THEIR OTHERWISE SO DO YOU SEE

00:56:44.901 --> 00:56:47.738 region:rollup2
WHAT DO YOU SEE THE TREND BEING

00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:50.140 region:rollup2
ARE LET'S SAY FROM THAT SAVED

00:56:47.738 --> 00:56:52.776 region:rollup2
FROM PREVIOUS. ON ADMINISTRATION

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:54.578 region:rollup2
TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY I MEAN DO

00:56:52.776 --> 00:56:56.613 region:rollup2
YOU SEE OUT THAT DOT OUR FEDERAL

00:56:54.578 --> 00:56:59.182 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT IS RECOGNIZING THE

00:56:56.613 --> 00:57:00.951 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF A AYE AND AS SUCH

00:56:59.182 --> 00:57:02.286 region:rollup2
OR ASA RESULT THEN WE

00:57:00.951 --> 00:57:05.389 region:rollup2
ALLOCATING MORE FUNDING INTO.

00:57:02.286 --> 00:57:06.890 region:rollup2
INTO THIS AREA OR NOT AND

00:57:05.389 --> 00:57:09.726 region:rollup2
THOUGHTFUL OF QUESTION IS THAT

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:12.362 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF SO OR REGARDLESS IN

00:57:09.726 --> 00:57:15.232 region:rollup2
WHAT CATEGORIES ARE WELL WE

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:18.135 region:rollup2
BASICALLY. ARE USING THAT THE

00:57:15.232 --> 00:57:22.172 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR OUR AND.

00:57:18.135 --> 00:57:22.839 region:rollup2
DOING IT APPROPRIATELY YEAH.

00:57:22.172 --> 00:57:23.473 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD QUESTIONS SO I THINK

00:57:22.839 --> 00:57:23.974 region:rollup2
WE SAW THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

00:57:23.473 --> 00:57:25.075 region:rollup2
BEING VERY ACTIVELY.

00:57:23.974 --> 00:57:25.776 region:rollup2
CONCERNED WITH SETTING A A AN

00:57:25.075 --> 00:57:26.576 region:rollup2
AGENDA AND ECONOMIC AND THE

00:57:25.776 --> 00:57:27.444 region:rollup2
SOCIAL AGENDA.

00:57:26.576 --> 00:57:28.812 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING BOTH THE POTENTIAL

00:57:27.444 --> 00:57:31.148 region:rollup2
AND THE RISKS.

00:57:28.812 --> 00:57:32.115 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS WAS TOWARD THE END

00:57:31.148 --> 00:57:34.284 region:rollup2
OF THE ADMINISTRATION.

00:57:32.115 --> 00:57:35.719 region:rollup2
I'M UNAWARE AS TO THE SIZE OF

00:57:34.284 --> 00:57:36.687 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING AT THE TIME.

00:57:35.719 --> 00:57:39.189 region:rollup2
I THINK.

00:57:36.687 --> 00:57:41.325 region:rollup2
JUDGING BY RECENT CONVERSATIONS

00:57:39.189 --> 00:57:43.660 region:rollup2
WITH AND PUBLICATIONS BY PEOPLE

00:57:41.325 --> 00:57:45.495 region:rollup2
LIKE MICHAEL CAUGHT CIOS AT THE.

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:47.731 region:rollup2
AT THE O. A STEEP BE THE OFFICE

00:57:45.495 --> 00:57:49.966 region:rollup2
OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY

00:57:47.731 --> 00:57:51.668 region:rollup2
THAT DEPUTY CTO.

00:57:49.966 --> 00:57:52.769 region:rollup2
WE RECENTLY MADE ABOUT TWO

00:57:51.668 --> 00:57:54.371 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE

00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:56.540 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY TO.

00:57:54.371 --> 00:57:59.276 region:rollup2
R. AND D. IN ARTIFICIAL

00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:59.710 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE IT IS NOT CLEAR TO

00:57:59.276 --> 00:58:01.878 region:rollup2
ME.

00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:03.613 region:rollup2
WHETHER THIS IS PART OF THE

00:58:01.878 --> 00:58:06.483 region:rollup2
SEVEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

00:58:03.613 --> 00:58:08.051 region:rollup2
SPEND AT THE DOD ON A AYE AND

00:58:06.483 --> 00:58:09.086 region:rollup2
RELATED TECHNOLOGIES OR WHETHER

00:58:08.051 --> 00:58:11.955 region:rollup2
THIS IS SEPARATE.

00:58:09.086 --> 00:58:14.524 region:rollup2
AT I ALSO DON'T KNOW HOW THIS

00:58:11.955 --> 00:58:16.360 region:rollup2
RECONCILES WITH THE.

00:58:14.524 --> 00:58:18.662 region:rollup2
EXISTING OR THREATENED DE

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:20.263 region:rollup2
FUNDING OF SCIENCE AND THE

00:58:18.662 --> 00:58:22.265 region:rollup2
FUTURE AND SF BUDGET.

00:58:20.263 --> 00:58:24.534 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE THOSE ALL STILL BE

00:58:22.265 --> 00:58:25.702 region:rollup2
QUESTION MARKS

00:58:24.534 --> 00:58:27.571 region:rollup2
YEAH YEAH I'M SO YEAH IS THEIR

00:58:25.702 --> 00:58:29.272 region:rollup2
EMPHASIS ON ANY PARTICULAR AREAS

00:58:27.571 --> 00:58:31.108 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES

00:58:29.272 --> 00:58:31.742 region:rollup2
OR OTHERWISE.

00:58:31.108 --> 00:58:33.643 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS CATEGORIES OF FUNDING

00:58:31.742 --> 00:58:35.078 region:rollup2
THAT. NYSERDA CERTAINLY WHAT

00:58:33.643 --> 00:58:36.513 region:rollup2
WE'RE HEARING IS AUTONOMOUS

00:58:35.078 --> 00:58:38.648 region:rollup2
WEAPONS SYSTEMS.

00:58:36.513 --> 00:58:40.484 region:rollup2
AND RELATED COMMANDING CONTROL

00:58:38.648 --> 00:58:42.619 region:rollup2
AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES.

00:58:40.484 --> 00:58:43.954 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY SOME

00:58:42.619 --> 00:58:46.089 region:rollup2
THE FAIRIES ACTIVITY THIS IS

00:58:43.954 --> 00:58:47.090 region:rollup2
THIS IS UNDERSTANDING HOW DO WE

00:58:46.089 --> 00:58:48.558 region:rollup2
RELATE TO.

00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:49.593 region:rollup2
SMART MACHINES IN THE

00:58:48.558 --> 00:58:51.161 region:rollup2
BATTLEFIELD.

00:58:49.593 --> 00:58:53.130 region:rollup2
OR IN POLICING AND HOW DO WE

00:58:51.161 --> 00:58:55.632 region:rollup2
MAKE WHAT THE MACHINE DECIDES

00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:56.767 region:rollup2
ó RECOMMENDS EXPLAINABLE TO

00:58:55.632 --> 00:58:57.701 region:rollup2
THE HUMAN DECISION MAKER.

00:58:56.767 --> 00:58:59.503 region:rollup2
AND.

00:58:57.701 --> 00:59:00.704 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT'S ONE BIG

00:58:59.503 --> 00:59:03.240 region:rollup2
AREA. I THINK.

00:59:00.704 --> 00:59:05.008 region:rollup2
BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACES IS

00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:06.777 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AREA WHERE A I WILL BE

00:59:05.008 --> 00:59:08.278 region:rollup2
INSTRUMENTAL. AND I KNOW THAT

00:59:06.777 --> 00:59:10.647 region:rollup2
THAT IS ALSO BEING STUDIED.

00:59:08.278 --> 00:59:12.983 region:rollup2
ACT ARE BY NO THE PLACES.

00:59:10.647 --> 00:59:14.418 region:rollup2
AND ISRAEL IN PARTICULAR ALSO

00:59:12.983 --> 00:59:16.620 region:rollup2
HAS SOME VERY EXCITING.

00:59:14.418 --> 00:59:17.721 region:rollup2
NEW VENTURES IN THAT AREA.

00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:19.556 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW AREAS

00:59:17.721 --> 00:59:21.658 region:rollup2
AMONGST OTHERS.

00:59:19.556 --> 00:59:23.193 region:rollup2
A MISTER OBERNOLTE.

00:59:21.658 --> 00:59:24.761 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO YOU

00:59:23.193 --> 00:59:26.063 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THE EXPLAINED ABILITY

00:59:24.761 --> 00:59:29.566 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

00:59:26.063 --> 00:59:30.567 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS AN AREA THAT I THINK

00:59:29.566 --> 00:59:32.335 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO.

00:59:30.567 --> 00:59:34.805 region:rollup2
REPRESENTS ONE TO KEEP THE KEY

00:59:32.335 --> 00:59:35.872 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS WITH THE INTEGRATION OF

00:59:34.805 --> 00:59:37.040 region:rollup2
THESE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES INTO

00:59:35.872 --> 00:59:39.676 region:rollup2
SOCIETY.

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:41.077 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE HAVE AN ALGORITHM.

00:59:39.676 --> 00:59:42.779 region:rollup2
AN ALGORITHMIC SOLUTION TO THE

00:59:41.077 --> 00:59:44.948 region:rollup2
PROCESSING OF DATA AT LEAST WE

00:59:42.779 --> 00:59:46.817 region:rollup2
CAN EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE HOW WE GOT

00:59:44.948 --> 00:59:48.885 region:rollup2
TO THE RESULT FROM THE INPUT BUT

00:59:46.817 --> 00:59:50.654 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HAVE. A A NEURAL NETWORK

00:59:48.885 --> 00:59:51.822 region:rollup2
THAT WERE TRAINING WITH MACHINE

00:59:50.654 --> 00:59:53.457 region:rollup2
LEARNING WE REALLY CAN'T

00:59:51.822 --> 00:59:55.125 region:rollup2
ARTICULATE THAT AND SO YOU CAN

00:59:53.457 --> 00:59:57.260 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATE. A TIME A COUPLE

00:59:55.125 --> 00:59:57.828 region:rollup2
YEARS FROM NOW WHERE WE GOT

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:58.628 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT ARE

00:59:57.828 --> 01:00:00.197 region:rollup2
SETTING.

00:59:58.628 --> 01:00:01.965 region:rollup2
LIFE INSURANCE RATES BASED ON

01:00:00.197 --> 01:00:04.167 region:rollup2
LIFE EXPECTANCIES ARE CALCULATED

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:06.002 region:rollup2
FROM THESE BIG DATA SETS AND WE

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:07.571 region:rollup2
CAN'T ARTICULATE TO PEOPLE WHY.

01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:09.139 region:rollup2
THIS PARTICULAR SET OF PEOPLE IS

01:00:07.571 --> 01:00:11.007 region:rollup2
AT GREATER RISK THAN THIS SET OF

01:00:09.139 --> 01:00:12.542 region:rollup2
PEOPLE I COULD BE. A OF A WIDE

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:14.177 region:rollup2
VARIETY A COMBINATION OF THINGS

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:15.979 region:rollup2
SO WHEREAS NOW. YOU CAN EXPLAIN

01:00:14.177 --> 01:00:16.947 region:rollup2
TO SOMEONE LOOK YOUR SMOKER AND

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:18.615 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY YOUR AVERAGE LIFE

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:19.916 region:rollup2
EXPECTANCY IS LOWER THEY MIGHT

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:22.686 region:rollup2
NOT LIKE IT BUT THEY ACCEPTED

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:23.520 region:rollup2
WHEREAS WE GET INTO TO THE.

01:00:22.686 --> 01:00:24.988 region:rollup2
.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:26.556 region:rollup2
THE EXPLAINED ABILITY PROBLEM

01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:28.058 region:rollup2
SPACE WHERE I YOU KNOW WE REALLY

01:00:26.556 --> 01:00:29.493 region:rollup2
CAN'T ARTICULATE THAT SO THE

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:30.494 region:rollup2
QUESTION IT'S OPEN AND QUESTION

01:00:29.493 --> 01:00:32.762 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THAT

01:00:30.494 --> 01:00:34.798 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I SEE THAT AS A BIG

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:37.200 region:rollup2
HINDRANCE. IN THE UP OUR ABILITY

01:00:34.798 --> 01:00:39.369 region:rollup2
TO USE A AYE IN WAYS THAT ARE

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.704 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVE TO OUR SOCIETY NOW. I

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:42.405 region:rollup2
THINK IS THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A

01:00:40.704 --> 01:00:43.507 region:rollup2
AND EMILY IMPORTANT QUESTION

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:45.275 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WE'RE SEEING A AYE

01:00:43.507 --> 01:00:45.876 region:rollup2
BEING USED BY COURTS AND BY

01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:47.878 region:rollup2
JUDGES.

01:00:45.876 --> 01:00:50.347 region:rollup2
IN VARIOUS U. S. STATES.

01:00:47.878 --> 01:00:52.182 region:rollup2
MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT.

01:00:50.347 --> 01:00:53.416 region:rollup2
RECIDIVISM AND ABOUT BAIL

01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:56.353 region:rollup2
DECISIONS.

01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:57.587 region:rollup2
THAT ARE FRAUGHT WITH BIAS.

01:00:56.353 --> 01:00:59.022 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT THAT THE MACHINE IS

01:00:57.587 --> 01:01:00.323 region:rollup2
BIASED IT'S THE HUMAN THAT

01:00:59.022 --> 01:01:01.758 region:rollup2
CREATED THE DATA.

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:03.627 region:rollup2
THAT GETS FED INTO THE MACHINE

01:01:01.758 --> 01:01:06.463 region:rollup2
THAT IS BIASED AND I THINK THE

01:01:03.627 --> 01:01:07.898 region:rollup2
WAY TO COUNTERACT THIS A IS TO.

01:01:06.463 --> 01:01:10.333 region:rollup2
DO TWO THINGS.

01:01:07.898 --> 01:01:11.401 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO WE NEED

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:12.636 region:rollup2
TO GOVERN THIS WE NEED TO SEE

01:01:11.401 --> 01:01:13.937 region:rollup2
THROUGH IT WE MIGHT NEED TO MAKE

01:01:12.636 --> 01:01:15.572 region:rollup2
IT TRANSPARENT.

01:01:13.937 --> 01:01:16.907 region:rollup2
SO IF IT IF THESE ARE A AYE

01:01:15.572 --> 01:01:18.742 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS IN THE PUBLIC

01:01:16.907 --> 01:01:21.444 region:rollup2
INTEREST WE NEED TO DEMAND THAT.

01:01:18.742 --> 01:01:23.413 region:rollup2
THE LOGIC BY WHICH OF THESE.

01:01:21.444 --> 01:01:25.448 region:rollup2
ALGORITHMS MAKE THESE DECISIONS

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:27.017 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE MADE OPEN AND

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:28.084 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENT SO THAT DEFENDING

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:29.719 region:rollup2
COUNSEL CAN ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO

01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:32.322 region:rollup2
IT.

01:01:29.719 --> 01:01:34.424 region:rollup2
SO THAT IS DEFINITELY ONE THING

01:01:32.322 --> 01:01:36.193 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO DO SECONDLY I THINK

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:38.461 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO START LOOKING AT. A

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:40.096 region:rollup2
VERY FINE.

01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:42.432 region:rollup2
OR ALTERNATIVELY SCRUBBING A

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:45.902 region:rollup2
DATA SETS OF FROM BIAS.

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:47.404 region:rollup2
AND MAKING SURE THAT THE DATA

01:01:45.902 --> 01:01:49.639 region:rollup2
THAT IS OUT THERE ALREADY.

01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:51.942 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE INTERNET THAT WE

01:01:49.639 --> 01:01:53.109 region:rollup2
ARE ALL USING AS IT IS FED INTO

01:01:51.942 --> 01:01:54.811 region:rollup2
THE MACHINE ISN'T.

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:56.880 region:rollup2
THAT THAT BIAS INGRAINED IN THAT

01:01:54.811 --> 01:01:57.414 region:rollup2
DATA SAID ISN'T EXACERBATED

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.515 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHAT IS HAPPENING

01:01:57.414 --> 01:01:59.516 region:rollup2
TODAY.

01:01:58.515 --> 01:02:00.584 region:rollup2
SO THAT NEEDS TO BE SOME

01:01:59.516 --> 01:02:04.287 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT.

01:02:00.584 --> 01:02:07.057 region:rollup2
OF DIAGNOSING AND SCANNING FOR

01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:08.525 region:rollup2
AND THEN SCRUBBING FOR THAT BAS.

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:09.025 region:rollup2
THAT TO ME WOULD BE THE SECOND

01:02:08.525 --> 01:02:10.594 region:rollup2
SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:12.662 region:rollup2
THAT'S

01:02:10.594 --> 01:02:14.331 region:rollup2
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:16.099 region:rollup2
MY FEAR WOULD BE THAT THAT

01:02:14.331 --> 01:02:18.368 region:rollup2
REQUIRES A AN INCREASED LEVEL OF

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:19.869 region:rollup2
SOPHISTICATION ON BEHALF OF THE

01:02:18.368 --> 01:02:21.671 region:rollup2
PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND HOW

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:23.306 region:rollup2
SCRUBBING THE DATA SAID. IN

01:02:21.671 --> 01:02:25.542 region:rollup2
BEING TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE DATA

01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:26.376 region:rollup2
ON THE ALGORITHM I SHOULD LEAD

01:02:25.542 --> 01:02:28.378 region:rollup2
TO A GREATER.

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:29.813 region:rollup2
A GREATER RELIABILITY OF THE

01:02:28.378 --> 01:02:30.647 region:rollup2
OUT YOU KNOW TO GREATER TRUST IN

01:02:29.813 --> 01:02:31.748 region:rollup2
THE OUTCOME.

01:02:30.647 --> 01:02:33.183 region:rollup2
AND I'M NOT SURE THAT WE'RE

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.783 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE

01:02:33.183 --> 01:02:35.251 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO

01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:37.053 region:rollup2
ARTICULATE. WITH ALGORITHMICS

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:38.421 region:rollup2
SOLUTION.

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:39.489 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE JUST PUT YOUR FINGER ON

01:02:38.421 --> 01:02:40.857 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:42.392 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS IN ALL OF THIS WHICH IS

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:42.826 region:rollup2
THAT WE JUST SIMPLY DON'T HAVE

01:02:42.392 --> 01:02:44.995 region:rollup2
NO.

01:02:42.826 --> 01:02:46.463 region:rollup2
BROUGHT ENOUGH OF A SKILL BASE

01:02:44.995 --> 01:02:48.365 region:rollup2
AND A KNOWLEDGE BASE TO REALLY

01:02:46.463 --> 01:02:50.567 region:rollup2
CRITIQUE MUCH LESS CHANGE MUCH

01:02:48.365 --> 01:02:52.669 region:rollup2
OF WHAT'S GOING ON. AND I THINK.

01:02:50.567 --> 01:02:53.169 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE SHOULD CERTAINLY

01:02:52.669 --> 01:02:54.938 region:rollup2
TAKE NOTE WHEN CHINA AS

01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:57.974 region:rollup2
TEACHING.

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:58.508 region:rollup2
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL

01:02:57.974 --> 01:03:00.210 region:rollup2
STUDENTS

01:02:58.508 --> 01:03:02.879 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU SAY I BECAUSE I THINK

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:04.080 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO EDUCATE OUR PUBLIC TO

01:03:02.879 --> 01:03:05.915 region:rollup2
BECOME MUCH SMARTER ON DATA

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.317 region:rollup2
SCIENCE. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO

01:03:05.915 --> 01:03:08.351 region:rollup2
BE A COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJOR TO

01:03:07.317 --> 01:03:10.754 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND.

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:12.055 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING ON A TO MAKE USE

01:03:10.754 --> 01:03:13.323 region:rollup2
OF IT IF YOU JUST EQUIPPED

01:03:12.055 --> 01:03:15.091 region:rollup2
TEACHERS AND.

01:03:13.323 --> 01:03:16.426 region:rollup2
AND TRAINERS AND COACHES TO

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:18.328 region:rollup2
TEACH US MORE BROADLY ABOUT HOW

01:03:16.426 --> 01:03:19.863 region:rollup2
THINGS WORK.

01:03:18.328 --> 01:03:21.631 region:rollup2
SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT THAT

01:03:19.863 --> 01:03:23.266 region:rollup2
COMPLEXITY IS OVERWHELMING AND

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:24.734 region:rollup2
MOST OF US DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT

01:03:23.266 --> 01:03:26.136 region:rollup2
TOOLS.

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:27.203 region:rollup2
TO SEE THROUGH ALL OF THAT BUT

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:29.172 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE HELPED WITH

01:03:27.203 --> 01:03:31.675 region:rollup2
EDUCATION MEASURED MEASURES WITH

01:03:29.172 --> 01:03:32.742 region:rollup2
TRAINING. WITH DATA SCIENCE

01:03:31.675 --> 01:03:34.878 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS ACROSS THE

01:03:32.742 --> 01:03:36.713 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL SPECTRUM.

01:03:34.878 --> 01:03:39.549 region:rollup2
IT'S FASCINATING THANK YOU KNOW.

01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:40.083 region:rollup2
ARE MISGUIDED WHO HAD.

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:41.284 region:rollup2
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

01:03:40.083 --> 01:03:42.786 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY OUT WHAT IT IS THE

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:44.220 region:rollup2
MOST SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT OF

01:03:42.786 --> 01:03:44.421 region:rollup2
A AYE RESEARCHERS TO DATE IS

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.955 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:48.024 region:rollup2
BEING ABOUT THAT.

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:49.092 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I'LL. BE THE WORLD

01:03:48.024 --> 01:03:50.827 region:rollup2
CHAMPION AND GO.

01:03:49.092 --> 01:03:50.994 region:rollup2
IS BEING ABLE TO BLOSSOM POKE

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:52.362 region:rollup2
HER.

01:03:50.994 --> 01:03:53.430 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU KNOW IS THERE ANYTHING

01:03:52.362 --> 01:03:55.265 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'VE SEEN THAT REALLY

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:57.801 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTS I? YOU KNOW.

01:03:55.265 --> 01:03:58.301 region:rollup2
THE CAPABILITIES THAT HAVE

01:03:57.801 --> 01:03:59.269 region:rollup2
ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED.

01:03:58.301 --> 01:04:01.271 region:rollup2
YEAH I MEAN I THINK THERE'S THE

01:03:59.269 --> 01:04:02.772 region:rollup2
OBVIOUS ONES WHICH IS AUTONOMOUS

01:04:01.271 --> 01:04:04.808 region:rollup2
CARS RIGHT AND.

01:04:02.772 --> 01:04:05.341 region:rollup2
I THINK WE WE WILL BE SEEING

01:04:04.808 --> 01:04:06.109 region:rollup2
OVER THE NEXT TWO TO THREE

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:08.144 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:09.879 region:rollup2
AUTONOMOUS CAR IS NAVIGATING.

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:11.381 region:rollup2
NOT JUST ON HIGHWAYS BUT

01:04:09.879 --> 01:04:12.749 region:rollup2
STARTING TO NAVIGATE IN INNER

01:04:11.381 --> 01:04:14.084 region:rollup2
CITIES WHICH ARE IMMENSELY

01:04:12.749 --> 01:04:16.219 region:rollup2
COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTS.

01:04:14.084 --> 01:04:18.455 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT IS LEVEL FOR LEVEL

01:04:16.219 --> 01:04:19.956 region:rollup2
FIVE AUTONOMY EXPERTS ARE

01:04:18.455 --> 01:04:22.459 region:rollup2
FIGHTING OVER AT THIS POINT.

01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:24.627 region:rollup2
SO BEING ABLE TO PUT YOUR KID

01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:26.096 region:rollup2
INTO A CAR AND HAVING THE CAR

01:04:24.627 --> 01:04:27.497 region:rollup2
DRIVE THE CHILD TO THE SCHOOL

01:04:26.096 --> 01:04:29.065 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A DRIVER IN IT.

01:04:27.497 --> 01:04:30.033 region:rollup2
IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:31.868 region:rollup2
PROBABLY GOING TO BE SEEN TO BE

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:33.570 region:rollup2
SAFE OVER THE NEXT I DON'T KNOW

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:36.539 region:rollup2
FIVE OR SIX YEARS. THAT'S A

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:37.807 region:rollup2
MAJOR SHIFT IN OUR IN OUR TRUST

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:39.976 region:rollup2
AS WELL IN TECHNOLOGIES.

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:40.944 region:rollup2
THERE ARE OTHER APPLICATIONS

01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:42.312 region:rollup2
OUT THERE THAT ARE.

01:04:40.944 --> 01:04:44.280 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY FASCINATING LIKE

01:04:42.312 --> 01:04:46.583 region:rollup2
CANCER DIAGNOSTICS.

KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT'S GOING

01:07:05.255 --> 01:07:08.424 region:rollup2
TO LOOK LIKE.

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:10.093 region:rollup2
IN IT COULD MOVE ON VERY AS YOU

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:11.127 region:rollup2
SAY VERY FAST TIME SCALES SO

01:07:10.093 --> 01:07:12.729 region:rollup2
WHEN WE'RE SORT OF DEALING WITH

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:13.997 region:rollup2
THE THE THINGS THAT WE TYPICALLY

01:07:12.729 --> 01:07:15.164 region:rollup2

DISPOSITION WE BRING TO BEAR AS

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.069 region:rollup2
POLICY MAKERS WHEN WE HAVE KIND

01:07:19.802 --> 01:07:23.206 region:rollup2
OF THIS.

LIKE YOURSELVES.

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:34.851 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE WE NEED

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:37.053 region:rollup2
TO DO TWO THINGS THE FIRST ONE

01:07:34.851 --> 01:07:37.954 region:rollup2
IS WE NEED TO STUDY THIS NOW SO

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:40.957 region:rollup2
IT WOULD HELP.

01:07:37.954 --> 01:07:42.692 region:rollup2
TO HAVE SACRAMENTO.

01:07:40.957 --> 01:07:44.093 region:rollup2
FACILITATE OR BE PART OF.

01:07:42.692 --> 01:07:46.095 region:rollup2
WHEN MICHAELA THINK TANK

01:07:44.093 --> 01:07:48.631 region:rollup2
BETWEEN CORPORATIONS

01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:50.466 region:rollup2
ENTREPRENEURS UNIVERSITIES.

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:52.335 region:rollup2
AND THE GOVERNMENT TO

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:53.770 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHERE ALL THIS IS

01:07:52.335 --> 01:07:54.871 region:rollup2
GOING WHERE WHERE DO WE THINK

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:55.838 region:rollup2
THE NEXT BREAKTHROUGH IS GOING

01:07:54.871 --> 01:07:57.507 region:rollup2
TO COME ONE OF THE MOST

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:59.275 region:rollup2
PROMISING AREAS AND HOW SHOULD

01:07:57.507 --> 01:08:00.343 region:rollup2
WE FACILITATE THOSE

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:01.945 region:rollup2
BREAKTHROUGHS WE DON'T WANT TO

01:08:00.343 --> 01:08:04.080 region:rollup2
HALT ECONOMIC GROWTH.

BUT UNDERSTANDING WHERE IT MIGHT

01:08:07.717 --> 01:08:11.421 region:rollup2
HAPPEN NEXT IS SOMETHING WE CAN

01:08:09.519 --> 01:08:13.957 region:rollup2
DO IF WE PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER

01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:15.858 region:rollup2
SETS NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS. I

01:08:13.957 --> 01:08:17.193 region:rollup2
THINK IT WOULD HELP TO HAVE AN

01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:18.461 region:rollup2
EXERCISE.

01:08:17.193 --> 01:08:19.996 region:rollup2

LIKE. AND THEN BACK INTO IT IS

01:08:31.574 --> 01:08:34.444 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CALL BACK CASTING WHAT

01:08:33.476 --> 01:08:35.745 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW AND

01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:37.480 region:rollup2
THEN. FOR THIS TO BE SHAPE

01:08:35.745 --> 01:08:38.915 region:rollup2

01:10:45.775 --> 01:10:49.745 region:rollup2
I AM A FORMER SENIOR PARTNER

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:51.114 region:rollup2
MACKENZIE BUT I'M NO LONGER

01:10:49.745 --> 01:10:52.582 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THE FARMER AND

01:10:51.114 --> 01:10:54.350 region:rollup2
THE WORK THAT I'M WILL DESCRIBE

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:55.251 region:rollup2
BRIEFLY WAS NOT DONE ON MY WATCH

01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:56.719 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH I THINK IT'S GREAT

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:58.154 region:rollup2
WORKS OF THE OPINIONS ARE JUST

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:59.388 region:rollup2
MY OWN NOT THEIRS.

01:10:58.154 --> 01:11:00.890 region:rollup2
I'M WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:03.493 region:rollup2
BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE

01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:03.993 region:rollup2
RESEARCH ON. MOST RECENT

01:11:03.493 --> 01:11:05.161 region:rollup2
RESEARCH ON ARTIFICIAL

01:11:03.993 --> 01:11:05.695 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE AND ITS

01:11:05.161 --> 01:11:07.163 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE LABOR

01:11:05.695 --> 01:11:08.798 region:rollup2
FORCE.

01:11:07.163 --> 01:11:10.099 region:rollup2
AND THEN LEAVE YOU WITH THREE

01:11:08.798 --> 01:11:11.267 region:rollup2
THOUGHTS ON THINGS THAT I WOULD

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:12.568 region:rollup2
PAY ATTENTION TO.

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:14.837 region:rollup2
SO LET ME START WITH THE SUMMARY

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:16.606 region:rollup2
OF THE RESEARCH.

01:11:14.837 --> 01:11:17.373 region:rollup2
MY TOP LINE ON IT IS STOP

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:19.475 region:rollup2
CALLING THIS THE ROBOT

01:11:17.373 --> 01:11:20.610 region:rollup2
APOCALYPSE.

01:11:19.475 --> 01:11:22.111 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT HELPFUL.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:24.280 region:rollup2
SCARES PEOPLE AND IT ISN'T A

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:26.649 region:rollup2
BALANCED VIEW ABOUT WHAT'S

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:28.784 region:rollup2
HAPPENING OR WHAT THE

01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:29.552 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS ARE WE REALLY NEED

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:30.987 region:rollup2
TO STEP BACK AND TAKE A

01:11:29.552 --> 01:11:32.388 region:rollup2
THOUGHTFUL BICU ABOUT WHAT'S

01:11:30.987 --> 01:11:33.356 region:rollup2
GOING AROUND. ON RATHER THAN

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:35.024 region:rollup2
RESORT TO HOLLYWOOD ERA VIEWS

01:11:33.356 --> 01:11:36.425 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD.

01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:38.427 region:rollup2
THE TCHNOLOGY IS A PROFESSOR

01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:40.530 region:rollup2
GOT ROTH WERE DESCRIBING

01:11:38.427 --> 01:11:42.698 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PROMISE AN ENORMOUS

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:44.367 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY

01:11:42.698 --> 01:11:45.134 region:rollup2
GREATER EFFICIENCY MORE SAFETY

01:11:44.367 --> 01:11:47.703 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY AND CONVENIENCE.

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:49.338 region:rollup2
THEY DO APPROPRIATELY AS A

01:11:47.703 --> 01:11:50.706 region:rollup2
RESEARCH SHOWS STROKE FEARS

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:52.475 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE EFFECTS ON JOB SKILLS

01:11:50.706 --> 01:11:53.576 region:rollup2
AND WAGES.

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:55.945 region:rollup2
MANY HAVE LOOKED AT THESE MOST

01:11:53.576 --> 01:11:58.147 region:rollup2
RECENTLY REALLY GOOD WORK AT

01:11:55.945 --> 01:11:58.714 region:rollup2
OXFORD. AND OF STUDY THAT I

01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:01.083 region:rollup2
MENTIONED FROM THE MCKINSEY

01:11:58.714 --> 01:12:03.352 region:rollup2
GLOBAL INSTITUTE. FIND THAT

01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:04.687 region:rollup2
LARGE SHARES OF EMPLOYMENT IN

01:12:03.352 --> 01:12:06.389 region:rollup2
BOTH DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:07.390 region:rollup2
WORLD.

01:12:06.389 --> 01:12:09.892 region:rollup2
TECHNICALLY BE AUTOMATED.

01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:11.327 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IS HISTORY HAS SHOWN.

01:12:09.892 --> 01:12:13.529 region:rollup2
THE ANXIETIES ABOUT WHAT MAYNARD

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:15.765 region:rollup2
KEYNES CALLED JOHN MAYNARD

01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:18.668 region:rollup2
KEYNES CALLED A CENTURY AGO

01:12:15.765 --> 01:12:19.535 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGICAL UNEMPLOYMENT. A

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:20.036 region:rollup2
TERM THAT I PREFER TO THE ROBOT

01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:21.070 region:rollup2
APOCALYPSE

01:12:20.036 --> 01:12:23.172 region:rollup2
WERE ACTUALLY QUITE OVERBLOWN A

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:25.608 region:rollup2
MORE APPROPRITE QUESTION HAS TO

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:28.077 region:rollup2
DO. WITH REEMPLOYMENT HOW ARE WE

01:12:25.608 --> 01:12:30.179 region:rollup2
GOING TO FIND WAYS THAT THE JOBS

01:12:28.077 --> 01:12:31.914 region:rollup2
THAT ARE CREATED BY THESE NEW

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:32.949 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES.

01:12:31.914 --> 01:12:33.616 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE HAVE

01:12:32.949 --> 01:12:35.251 region:rollup2
THE SKILLS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:12:33.616 --> 01:12:36.852 region:rollup2
PURSUE THOSE JOBS.

01:12:35.251 --> 01:12:39.422 region:rollup2
IN THE FUTURE MOST LIKELY AS IN

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:40.022 region:rollup2
THE PAST THE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN

01:12:39.422 --> 01:12:42.024 region:rollup2
THAT TECHNOLOGY IS LIKELY TO

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:43.926 region:rollup2
FUEL PRODUCTIVITY GAINS.

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:47.129 region:rollup2
INCOME GROWTH AND BOOST DEMANDS

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:48.297 region:rollup2
FOR LABOR. ADD TO THAT LOWER

01:12:47.129 --> 01:12:49.665 region:rollup2
PRICES AND RISING QUALITY

01:12:48.297 --> 01:12:52.869 region:rollup2
DEMANDS AND GOODS FOR SERVICES

01:12:49.665 --> 01:12:53.836 region:rollup2
AND SERVICES ARE LIKELY TO RISE.

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:55.771 region:rollup2
MANY OF JOBS THAT WILL BE

01:12:53.836 --> 01:12:56.305 region:rollup2
CREATED.

01:12:55.771 --> 01:12:57.940 region:rollup2
COULD NOT EVEN HAVE BEEN

01:12:56.305 --> 01:12:59.976 region:rollup2
IMAGINED IN THE PAST

01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:01.744 region:rollup2
A CENTURY AGO WHO WOULD HAVE

01:12:59.976 --> 01:13:03.179 region:rollup2
THOUGHT THAT AUTOMOBILES WOULD

01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:03.779 region:rollup2
LEAD TO A DRIVE THROUGH

01:13:03.179 --> 01:13:05.514 region:rollup2
RESTAURANTS A ROADSIDE MORE

01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:07.283 region:rollup2
TELLS. WILL MORE RECENTLY THAT

01:13:05.514 --> 01:13:08.718 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION AGE WOULD LEAD

01:13:07.283 --> 01:13:12.021 region:rollup2
TO STADIUMS FULL OF PEOPLE

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:16.492 region:rollup2
WATCHING VIDEO GAMERS COMPETE

01:13:12.021 --> 01:13:17.326 region:rollup2
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:18.828 region:rollup2
THE WORK FROM THE MCKINSEY

01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:21.898 region:rollup2
GLOBAL INSTITUTE DID A VARIETY

01:13:18.828 --> 01:13:23.766 region:rollup2
OF SCENARIOS AROUND WHAT HAPPENS

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:25.635 region:rollup2
TO JOBS UNDER THE. APPLICATION

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:26.769 region:rollup2
OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGY DEPENDING

01:13:25.635 --> 01:13:28.104 region:rollup2
ON THE SPEED AND PACE WITH WHICH

01:13:26.769 --> 01:13:30.706 region:rollup2
IT PROCEEDS.

01:13:28.104 --> 01:13:31.507 region:rollup2
THEIR MID POINT ESTIMATE WAS

01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:35.411 region:rollup2
THAT ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT OF

01:13:31.507 --> 01:13:36.579 region:rollup2
THE GLOBAL WORK FORCE.

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:37.747 region:rollup2
WILL BE DISPLACED OR COULD BE

01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:40.049 region:rollup2
DISPLACED OVER THE NEXT DECADE

01:13:37.747 --> 01:13:41.050 region:rollup2
FROM FROM THE SETS OF

01:13:40.049 --> 01:13:41.784 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES.

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:42.685 region:rollup2
A FASTER PACE COULD CRACK

01:13:41.784 --> 01:13:44.153 region:rollup2
TRIGGER GREATER DISPLACEMENT AND

01:13:42.685 --> 01:13:46.222 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY A SLOWER PACE WOULD DO

01:13:44.153 --> 01:13:47.657 region:rollup2
SLOWER DISPLACEMENT.

01:13:46.222 --> 01:13:49.558 region:rollup2
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT AS A

01:13:47.657 --> 01:13:51.460 region:rollup2
RESULT OF INCREASES AND DEMANDS

01:13:49.558 --> 01:13:53.462 region:rollup2
AND SERVICES AS I DESCRIBED FOR

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:54.997 region:rollup2
GOODS AND SERVICES.

01:13:53.462 --> 01:13:56.799 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE JOB GROWTH IN

01:13:54.997 --> 01:13:58.768 region:rollup2
AREAS SUCH AS INFRASTRUCTURE

01:13:56.799 --> 01:14:01.037 region:rollup2
ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:02.838 region:rollup2
AND NEW JOBS ARE AS LIKELY TO

01:14:01.037 --> 01:14:04.240 region:rollup2
OUTPACE THE JOB LOSS.

01:14:02.838 --> 01:14:05.841 region:rollup2
THE NEW JOBS WILL DIFFER

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:07.243 region:rollup2
MIGHTILY HOWEVER FROM THE JOBS

01:14:05.841 --> 01:14:08.044 region:rollup2
THAT ARE LOST.

01:14:07.243 --> 01:14:10.379 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE OUT

01:14:08.044 --> 01:14:11.614 region:rollup2
PACED AND DISPLACED BY

01:14:10.379 --> 01:14:13.316 region:rollup2
AUTOMATION THAT IS GONNA REQUIRE

01:14:11.614 --> 01:14:15.985 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT.

01:14:13.316 --> 01:14:17.286 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONS AND COSTS ON WORKERS

01:14:15.985 --> 01:14:18.988 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES.

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:20.056 region:rollup2
IN THE UNITED STATES DEPENDING

01:14:18.988 --> 01:14:24.293 region:rollup2
ON THE PACE OF THAT AUTOMATION

01:14:20.056 --> 01:14:26.696 region:rollup2
THEIR ESTIMATE WAS. THAT UP

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:27.296 region:rollup2
BETWEEN TEN AND. THIRTY PERCENT

01:14:26.696 --> 01:14:28.297 region:rollup2
OF THE WORK FORCE THE UNITED

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:29.398 region:rollup2
STATES WILL HAVE TO EITHER

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:30.766 region:rollup2
CHANGE OCCUPATIONAL CATEGORY

01:14:29.398 --> 01:14:31.967 region:rollup2
SPORTS SKILLS ASSOCIATED WITH

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:34.036 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:36.238 region:rollup2
THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO IS THAT

01:14:34.036 --> 01:14:38.574 region:rollup2
THIS WILL NOT RESULT IN MASSIVE

01:14:36.238 --> 01:14:39.875 region:rollup2
JOB LOSSES BUT IT WILL CHANGE

01:14:38.574 --> 01:14:41.844 region:rollup2
THE JOBS OF JUST ABOUT EVERYONE.

01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:43.479 region:rollup2
SO THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:45.281 region:rollup2
NOT TO THINK ABOUT ARE WE GONNA

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:46.816 region:rollup2
HAVE ROBOTS IT OUR JOBS. BUT HOW

01:14:45.281 --> 01:14:47.883 region:rollup2
DO WE FIND THE SETS OF SKILLS

01:14:46.816 --> 01:14:49.985 region:rollup2
AND CAPABILITIES THAT ALLOW

01:14:47.883 --> 01:14:51.754 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO WORK ALONGSIDE ROBOTS

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:53.789 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE. THAT THEY HAVE HIGH

01:14:51.754 --> 01:14:55.257 region:rollup2
QUALITY OPPORTUNITIES.

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:56.926 region:rollup2
THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS

01:14:55.257 --> 01:14:58.561 region:rollup2
THAT I WOULD THINK ABOUT AS

01:14:56.926 --> 01:14:59.395 region:rollup2
YOU'RE EXPLORING THIS ISSUE IN

01:14:58.561 --> 01:15:01.230 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:14:59.395 --> 01:15:03.466 region:rollup2
OUR NUMBER ONE.

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:04.066 region:rollup2
DO NO HARM.

01:15:03.466 --> 01:15:05.568 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE NO ONE ELSE DOES ANY

01:15:04.066 --> 01:15:07.136 region:rollup2
HARM.

01:15:05.568 --> 01:15:08.938 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE IN FACT AS PROFESSOR

01:15:07.136 --> 01:15:11.173 region:rollup2
ACROSS SAID IN AN INTELLECTUAL

01:15:08.938 --> 01:15:12.041 region:rollup2
AND DATA ARMS RACE NOT JUST WITH

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:13.609 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES BUT WITH OTHER

01:15:12.041 --> 01:15:14.810 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES.

01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:16.412 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY THAT

01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:18.247 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA OR THE UNITED STATES

01:15:16.412 --> 01:15:19.815 region:rollup2
HAS AN INEVITABLE RIGHT TO WIN

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:21.350 region:rollup2
THIS ARMS RACE.

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:22.985 region:rollup2
WE DO NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:24.520 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES AND CAPABILITIES

01:15:22.985 --> 01:15:26.222 region:rollup2
THAT ARE BEING INVENTED HERE.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:27.656 region:rollup2
ARE APPLIED AND USED TO CREATE

01:15:26.222 --> 01:15:29.091 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES AND PRODUCTIVITY

01:15:27.656 --> 01:15:30.826 region:rollup2
AND GROWTH.

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:32.828 region:rollup2
BUT THAT THOSE WHO ARE DEPLOYING

01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:34.964 region:rollup2
THOSE TECHNOLOGIES PLAYS BY PLAY

01:15:32.828 --> 01:15:35.464 region:rollup2
BY RULES OF THE GAME. THAT MAKE

01:15:34.964 --> 01:15:36.832 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THIS WORKS FOR

01:15:35.464 --> 01:15:38.134 region:rollup2
EVERYONE.

01:15:36.832 --> 01:15:39.602 region:rollup2
AS PROFESSOR ACROSS SAID

01:15:38.134 --> 01:15:41.937 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY ON THAT LIST ARE

01:15:39.602 --> 01:15:44.039 region:rollup2
ISSUES AROUND ETHICS AND PRIVACY

01:15:41.937 --> 01:15:45.508 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT THE TRANSPARENCY

01:15:44.039 --> 01:15:47.109 region:rollup2
THAT'S NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT

01:15:45.508 --> 01:15:48.711 region:rollup2
THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE DEPLOYED

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:50.246 region:rollup2
FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD. NOT JUST

01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:50.880 region:rollup2
THE PRIVATE GOOD.

01:15:50.246 --> 01:15:52.381 region:rollup2
AREN'T AREN'T IMPORTANT PART OF

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.582 region:rollup2
EQUATION.

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:55.551 region:rollup2
THE SECOND AND PERHAPS MORE

01:15:53.582 --> 01:15:57.186 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IMPLICATION. OF THESE

01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:58.554 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES.

01:15:57.186 --> 01:16:00.122 region:rollup2
ARE THE IMPACT THAT THEY WILL

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:02.258 region:rollup2
HAVE ON IN EQUALITY AND ECONOMIC

01:16:00.122 --> 01:16:04.060 region:rollup2
MOBILITY.

01:16:02.258 --> 01:16:06.061 region:rollup2
THE TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:07.463 region:rollup2
DEPLOYED IN ALL LIKELIHOOD AND

01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:09.098 region:rollup2
WILL BENEFIT THOSE WHO CAN

01:16:07.463 --> 01:16:10.332 region:rollup2
BENEFIT FROM THEM. WE NEED TO

01:16:09.098 --> 01:16:12.301 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THOSE GAINS GO

01:16:10.332 --> 01:16:13.436 region:rollup2
PROBABLY NOT JUST NARROWLY TO

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:14.637 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO HAVE CREATED THE

01:16:13.436 --> 01:16:16.605 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY OR HAVE THE SETS OF

01:16:14.637 --> 01:16:16.972 region:rollup2
SKILLS TO IT TO BENEFIT FROM

01:16:16.605 --> 01:16:18.941 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:16:16.972 --> 01:16:20.976 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S LIKELY TO SEE THESE

01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:21.977 region:rollup2
IMPACTS EARLY. NOT JUST BECAUSE

01:16:20.976 --> 01:16:23.646 region:rollup2
OF THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE

01:16:21.977 --> 01:16:25.748 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES BUT BECAUSE THE

01:16:23.646 --> 01:16:27.283 region:rollup2
NATURE OF OUR WORK FORCE AND OUR

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:29.251 region:rollup2
POPULATION TO BEGIN WITH.

01:16:27.283 --> 01:16:29.819 region:rollup2
ACCORDINGLY CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:31.187 region:rollup2
LEAD ON THINKING ABOUT THE

01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:33.789 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS

01:16:31.187 --> 01:16:34.356 region:rollup2
FOR EQUALITY AND MOBILITY AND

01:16:33.789 --> 01:16:35.391 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT WERE TRACKING

01:16:34.356 --> 01:16:36.792 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:16:35.391 --> 01:16:38.761 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO HAVE GOALS FOR

01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:40.062 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC MOBILITY. THAT ARE AT

01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:42.097 region:rollup2
THE SAME.

01:16:40.062 --> 01:16:44.900 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE AS WE HAVE

01:16:42.097 --> 01:16:46.202 region:rollup2
GOALS FOR. CLIMATE. GOALS AND

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:47.203 region:rollup2
THAT WE WERE THINKING ABOUT NOT

01:16:46.202 --> 01:16:48.771 region:rollup2
JUST THE DEPLOYMENT OF

01:16:47.203 --> 01:16:50.306 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES BUT ITS IMPACT ON

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:51.407 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AND THEIR OPPORTUNITIES

01:16:50.306 --> 01:16:53.642 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T JUST WAKE UP TWENTY

01:16:51.407 --> 01:16:54.243 region:rollup2
YEARS FROM NOW FIND THAT THIS IS

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:55.878 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T PAID

01:16:54.243 --> 01:16:57.213 region:rollup2
ATTENTION.

01:16:55.878 --> 01:16:58.848 region:rollup2
AND THE THIRD AND PERHAPS MOST

01:16:57.213 --> 01:17:00.816 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ELEMENT THAT THIS

01:16:58.848 --> 01:17:02.451 region:rollup2
RESEARCH HAS SHOWN. IS THAT THE

01:17:00.816 --> 01:17:03.018 region:rollup2
BIGGEST QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:04.787 region:rollup2
HOW WE MANAGE THROUGH THIS

01:17:03.018 --> 01:17:06.355 region:rollup2
TRANSITION.

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:07.990 region:rollup2
AND HOW WE DO IT AT THE PACE AND

01:17:06.355 --> 01:17:10.326 region:rollup2
SCALE THAT'S NECESSARY.

01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:12.595 region:rollup2
TO KEEP PACE WITH THE

01:17:10.326 --> 01:17:14.130 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE.

01:17:12.595 --> 01:17:15.865 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT ELEMENTS

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:17.099 region:rollup2
OF THAT FROM MY VIEW THAT NEED

01:17:15.865 --> 01:17:18.734 region:rollup2
TO BE ON THE AGENDA AND ARE

01:17:17.099 --> 01:17:20.469 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO BE. THOUGHT OF NOT

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:21.203 region:rollup2
JUST AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT AT

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:22.705 region:rollup2
THE STATE LEVEL.

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:23.272 region:rollup2
THE FIRST ONE OF THOSE IS

01:17:22.705 --> 01:17:25.141 region:rollup2
RETHINKING OUR SOCIAL SAFETY

01:17:23.272 --> 01:17:26.041 region:rollup2
NET.

01:17:25.141 --> 01:17:27.977 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE LARGE

01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:29.712 region:rollup2
DISPLACEMENTS FROM A NUMBER OF

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:31.280 region:rollup2
THESE TECHNOLOGIES.

01:17:29.712 --> 01:17:32.982 region:rollup2
WHICH WILL REQUIRE THAT THERE

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.517 region:rollup2
WILL BE PEOPLE FOR SUBSTANTIAL

01:17:32.982 --> 01:17:35.484 region:rollup2
PERIODS OF TIME WHO ARE GOING TO

01:17:34.517 --> 01:17:36.886 region:rollup2
NEED OME HELP WORKING THROUGH

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:37.953 region:rollup2
THAT TRANSITION.

01:17:36.886 --> 01:17:39.488 region:rollup2
SO THINKING ABOUT WHAT OUR

01:17:37.953 --> 01:17:40.923 region:rollup2
UNEMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS LOOK LIKE

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:42.491 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT WHAT OUR OUR

01:17:40.923 --> 01:17:44.360 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO ENSURE

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:45.794 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE HAVE. THE ABILITY TO

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:48.931 region:rollup2
MANAGE THROUGH THOSE ARE ALL

01:17:45.794 --> 01:17:50.933 region:rollup2
REAL. AND CONNECTED TO FINDING

01:17:48.931 --> 01:17:52.735 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES AGAIN. I DO THINK

01:17:50.933 --> 01:17:54.837 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE PORTABLE BENEFITS

01:17:52.735 --> 01:17:57.039 region:rollup2
JUST AND FINDING OPPORTUNITIES

01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:58.807 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE A.

01:17:57.039 --> 01:17:59.308 region:rollup2
CASH AND OTHER SUPPORT FOR THOSE

01:17:58.807 --> 01:18:00.576 region:rollup2
TIME PERIODS ARE CAN BE

01:17:59.308 --> 01:18:02.878 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

01:18:00.576 --> 01:18:05.080 region:rollup2
PERSONALLY I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF

01:18:02.878 --> 01:18:06.549 region:rollup2
YOU BI I AS A SILVER BULLET TO

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:08.450 region:rollup2
THE SOLUTIONS BUT THE QUESTION

01:18:06.549 --> 01:18:11.153 region:rollup2
AROUND CASH TRANSFERS NEEDS TO

01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:14.623 region:rollup2
BE PART EQUATION. AS WELL.

01:18:11.153 --> 01:18:15.791 region:rollup2
SECONDLY WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT.

01:18:14.623 --> 01:18:17.593 region:rollup2
PASTE AND CHANGE OF OUR

01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:19.094 region:rollup2
EDUCATION SYSTEM TO MEET THE

01:18:17.593 --> 01:18:20.396 region:rollup2
PACE OF CHANGE OF WHAT'S GOING

01:18:19.094 --> 01:18:21.230 region:rollup2
ON IN TECHNOLOGY.

01:18:20.396 --> 01:18:23.065 region:rollup2
IT'S NO LONGER GOING TO BE

01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:26.402 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE TO THINK ABOUT YOU

01:18:23.065 --> 01:18:27.937 region:rollup2
LEARN FROM ZERO TO TWENTY TWO.

01:18:26.402 --> 01:18:28.871 region:rollup2
AND YOU AREN'T AFTER THAT WE'RE

01:18:27.937 --> 01:18:31.006 region:rollup2
GONNA HAVE TO THINK ABOUT LIFE

01:18:28.871 --> 01:18:32.408 region:rollup2
LONG LEARNING. WHERE YOU HAVE

01:18:31.006 --> 01:18:33.976 region:rollup2
PERIODS OF TIME WHEN YOU WILL BE

01:18:32.408 --> 01:18:35.477 region:rollup2
IN SCHOOL PERIODS OF TIME YOU

01:18:33.976 --> 01:18:37.279 region:rollup2
WILL BE WORKING AND MOST LIKELY

01:18:35.477 --> 01:18:37.846 region:rollup2
MANY PARENTS THROUGHOUT YOUR

01:18:37.279 --> 01:18:38.681 region:rollup2
LIFE WHEN YOU WILL BE DOING

01:18:37.846 --> 01:18:41.016 region:rollup2
BOTH?

01:18:38.681 --> 01:18:42.585 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED THE SAME THINKING AND

01:18:41.016 --> 01:18:44.520 region:rollup2
AGGRESSIVENESS THAT CALIFORNIA

01:18:42.585 --> 01:18:46.488 region:rollup2
LED TO THE MASTER PLAN FOR

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:47.489 region:rollup2
HIGHER EDUCATION TO THINK ABOUT.

01:18:46.488 --> 01:18:49.158 region:rollup2
HOW WE MANAGE THROUGH A

01:18:47.489 --> 01:18:50.359 region:rollup2
TRANSITION OVER THE COURSE OF

01:18:49.158 --> 01:18:51.994 region:rollup2
THE NEXT TWO DECADES?

01:18:50.359 --> 01:18:53.796 region:rollup2
TWO A NECESSITY FOR LIFELONG

01:18:51.994 --> 01:18:55.531 region:rollup2
LEARNING. THAT WILL INCLUDE

01:18:53.796 --> 01:18:57.032 region:rollup2
INVESTING AND INNOVATIONS THAT

01:18:55.531 --> 01:18:59.401 region:rollup2
ALLOWED PEOPLE TO CONTINUE TO

01:18:57.032 --> 01:19:00.903 region:rollup2
EARN WHILE THEY LEARN NOT STEP

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:01.704 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE WORK FORCE FULLY TO.

01:19:00.903 --> 01:19:03.439 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO.

01:19:01.704 --> 01:19:06.175 region:rollup2
REGAIN THOSE SKILLS SO THINGS

01:19:03.439 --> 01:19:08.544 region:rollup2
LIKE ONLINE LEARNING BLENDED

01:19:06.175 --> 01:19:09.979 region:rollup2
LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES TO.

01:19:08.544 --> 01:19:11.447 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BE EMPLOYED IN AND

01:19:09.979 --> 01:19:13.349 region:rollup2
SAT EMPLOYERS TO INVEST IN

01:19:11.447 --> 01:19:14.283 region:rollup2
LEARNING WILL BE AN IMPORTANT

01:19:13.349 --> 01:19:16.952 region:rollup2
PART EQUATION AS WELL.

01:19:14.283 --> 01:19:19.088 region:rollup2
SO IN SUMMARY I'M NOT SCARED OF

01:19:16.952 --> 01:19:20.823 region:rollup2
THE ROBOT APOCALYPSE.

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:22.558 region:rollup2
MOST AVAILABLE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS

01:19:20.823 --> 01:19:24.260 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS TEN TO FIFTEEN

01:19:22.558 --> 01:19:25.694 region:rollup2
YEARS OF TRANSITION OF ONE OR

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:27.096 region:rollup2
TWO PERCENT OF THE WORKFORCE

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:29.198 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONING EVERY YEAR.

01:19:27.096 --> 01:19:30.1000 region:rollup2
THAT IS A BIG NUMBER TO HAPPEN

01:19:29.198 --> 01:19:31.667 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR BUT IT IS NOT LIKE

01:19:30.1000 --> 01:19:34.136 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO BE NO JOBS IN A

01:19:31.667 --> 01:19:35.638 region:rollup2
DECADE. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

01:19:34.136 --> 01:19:36.205 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE ENSURE THAT WE GET

01:19:35.638 --> 01:19:37.773 region:rollup2
THE GAINS FROM THESE

01:19:36.205 --> 01:19:38.307 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE AND MAKE

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:40.242 region:rollup2
SURE THAT IT DOESN'T JUST

01:19:38.307 --> 01:19:42.211 region:rollup2
AFFECT.

01:19:40.242 --> 01:19:44.480 region:rollup2
AT ECONOMIC MOBILITY AND THAT WE

01:19:42.211 --> 01:19:46.015 region:rollup2
HELP ALL CALIFORNIANS ON BEHALF

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:47.683 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIAN UNITED STATES

01:19:46.015 --> 01:19:50.352 region:rollup2
MANAGED TO THE TRANSITIONS AS WE

01:19:47.683 --> 01:19:51.854 region:rollup2
LOOK AS WE UP MOVE TO THIS NEXT

01:19:50.352 --> 01:19:54.223 region:rollup2
ECONOMY. THANK YOU

01:19:51.854 --> 01:19:56.825 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT. MR AT.

01:19:54.223 --> 01:19:59.628 region:rollup2
MISRAQ.

01:19:56.825 --> 01:20:03.432 region:rollup2
YES.

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:03.832 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AYE SHALL REMEMBER.

01:20:03.432 --> 01:20:05.467 region:rollup2
HERE WE LOOK AT.

01:20:03.832 --> 01:20:07.336 region:rollup2
YES.

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:09.405 region:rollup2
OKAY. GO AHEAD.

01:20:07.336 --> 01:20:10.773 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL LET ME. START

01:20:09.405 --> 01:20:14.276 region:rollup2
BROUGH BY THING I AGREE WITH

01:20:10.773 --> 01:20:15.744 region:rollup2
VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING THAT LIKE

01:20:14.276 --> 01:20:17.012 region:rollup2
CALLING MY NAME IS ALSO SAID.

01:20:15.744 --> 01:20:17.613 region:rollup2
LET ME START WITH SEVERAL QUOTES

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:19.515 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK FRAME THIS ISSUE

01:20:17.613 --> 01:20:21.150 region:rollup2
QUITE WELL.

01:20:19.515 --> 01:20:23.218 region:rollup2
FIRST IS QUOTE AUTUMN IS

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:25.254 region:rollup2
AUTOMATIC MACHINERY DRIVEN BY

01:20:23.218 --> 01:20:26.522 region:rollup2
LIMITLESS POWER GOING TO LEAVE

01:20:25.254 --> 01:20:29.925 region:rollup2
HONOR HERE'S A STATE OF CHRONIC

01:20:26.522 --> 01:20:33.095 region:rollup2
AND INCREASING. UNEMPLOYMENT.

01:20:29.925 --> 01:20:33.095 region:rollup2
SECONDLY WE MUST CONVINCE OUR

01:20:33.162 --> 01:20:37.366 region:rollup2
ON THEM FULL EMPLOYMENT THE PACE

01:20:34.697 --> 01:20:38.100 region:rollup2
OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE

01:20:37.366 --> 01:20:39.134 region:rollup2
XCELERATED.

01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:40.169 region:rollup2
THE THIRD IS THE EFFECT OF

01:20:39.134 --> 01:20:42.004 region:rollup2
AUTOMATION ON UNEMPLOYMENT AS

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:44.106 region:rollup2
BEEN WIDELY IT RESPONSIBLY

01:20:42.004 --> 01:20:45.341 region:rollup2
EXAGGERATED. PRINCIPALLY BY

01:20:44.106 --> 01:20:48.010 region:rollup2
SOCIAL SCIENTISTS WHO SEEM

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:49.178 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN A COMPETITION OF ALL

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:50.913 region:rollup2
OF THIS.

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:52.481 region:rollup2
ARE ALL THREE OF THOSE VOTES.

01:20:50.913 --> 01:20:54.183 region:rollup2
ONE OF QUIRK WONDER GO ON THE

01:20:52.481 --> 01:20:55.317 region:rollup2
FIRST WAS BY THE U. S. SECRETARY

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:56.719 region:rollup2
OF LABOR IN NINETEEN TWENTY

01:20:55.317 --> 01:20:58.821 region:rollup2
SEVEN.

01:20:56.719 --> 01:21:00.989 region:rollup2
THE SECOND WAS FROM A LEADING A

01:20:58.821 --> 01:21:03.058 region:rollup2
AYE SCIENTISTS AND STILL TODAY.

01:21:00.989 --> 01:21:04.493 region:rollup2
SAYS THE SAME THINGS THAT HE

01:21:03.058 --> 01:21:05.360 region:rollup2
SAID THAT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY

01:21:04.493 --> 01:21:07.229 region:rollup2
FOUR.

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:08.897 region:rollup2
AND THE THIRD WAS FROM A VERY

01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:10.933 region:rollup2
GOOD BOOK CALLED THE AUTOMATION

01:21:08.897 --> 01:21:11.900 region:rollup2
HANNEKE.

01:21:10.933 --> 01:21:14.303 region:rollup2
FROM NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE.

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:15.704 region:rollup2
MY POINT OF.

01:21:14.303 --> 01:21:17.506 region:rollup2
GIVING THOSE CLOSES POINT OUT

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:19.808 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS NOTHING NEW.

01:21:17.506 --> 01:21:21.877 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY WHEN THEY'VE BEEN

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:24.179 region:rollup2
PERIODS OF NEW WAVES OF

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:24.747 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:25.981 region:rollup2
YOUR LAST ECONOMY.

01:21:24.747 --> 01:21:27.683 region:rollup2
THEY'D BEEN ACCOMPANIED

01:21:25.981 --> 01:21:28.917 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES BY WHAT YOU CALL

01:21:27.683 --> 01:21:30.119 region:rollup2
TECHNO PANIC.

01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:31.787 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY AROUND LABOR MARKET

01:21:30.119 --> 01:21:33.522 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS.

01:21:31.787 --> 01:21:34.656 region:rollup2
WE SEE THE SAME THING GOING ON

01:21:33.522 --> 01:21:37.659 region:rollup2
AGAIN TODAY.

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:39.395 region:rollup2
THERE ARE. PUNDITS AND AUTHORED

01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:41.497 region:rollup2
LIKE MARTIN FORD THAT.

01:21:39.395 --> 01:21:44.099 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZES THE ROBOTS WHO SAYS

01:21:41.497 --> 01:21:45.134 region:rollup2
THAT. BY TWENTY IT IS SUCH A BY

01:21:44.099 --> 01:21:46.568 region:rollup2
THE END OF THE CENTURY ADOBE

01:21:45.134 --> 01:21:49.204 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT

01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:50.172 region:rollup2
UNEMPLOYMENT ONLY TWENTY FIVE

01:21:49.204 --> 01:21:52.107 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF PEOPLE WORKING.

01:21:50.172 --> 01:21:54.042 region:rollup2
ANOTHER A JOURNALIST KEVIN DRUM

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:55.811 region:rollup2
RATES IN MOTHER JONES THAT IN

01:21:54.042 --> 01:21:57.346 region:rollup2
FORTY YEARS THERE SIMPLY WILL BE

01:21:55.811 --> 01:22:00.349 region:rollup2
NO JOB LAST.

01:21:57.346 --> 01:22:01.383 region:rollup2
IT IS THIS FEAR FRANKLY AS AS AS

01:22:00.349 --> 01:22:03.285 region:rollup2
MONEY SAID THE THERE ARE YOUR

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:05.521 region:rollup2
APOCALYPTIC FEARS THAT ARE JUST

01:22:03.285 --> 01:22:09.224 region:rollup2
HAVE NO BASIS IN GROUNDED IN

01:22:05.521 --> 01:22:10.125 region:rollup2
EITHER HISTORICAL. EVIDENCE OR

01:22:09.224 --> 01:22:11.960 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC REALITY.

01:22:10.125 --> 01:22:14.363 region:rollup2
WE CAN REST ASSURED THAT IN

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:15.898 region:rollup2
TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE YEARS WE

01:22:14.363 --> 01:22:17.332 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE PLENTY OF JOBS.

01:22:15.898 --> 01:22:19.301 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT I DO THINK WE HAVE A

01:22:17.332 --> 01:22:21.904 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE ON IS THE ADJUSTMENT

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:24.740 region:rollup2
ISSUE POWER WORKERS GOING TO

01:22:21.904 --> 01:22:26.341 region:rollup2
COPE WITH HAVING TO BE HAVING TO

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:27.209 region:rollup2
MOVE TO NEW KINDS OF JOBS?

01:22:26.341 --> 01:22:28.510 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DOUBT

01:22:27.209 --> 01:22:30.279 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:32.247 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN LABOR MARKET

01:22:30.279 --> 01:22:34.082 region:rollup2
DISLOCATION RIGHT.

01:22:32.247 --> 01:22:35.984 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IT OR NOT THE LAST FOR

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:36.285 region:rollup2
THE LAST FEW YEARS I'VE BEEN

01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:37.219 region:rollup2
QUITE GOOD.

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:38.587 region:rollup2
.

01:22:37.219 --> 01:22:39.988 region:rollup2
WE RECENTLY RELEASED A STUDY

01:22:38.587 --> 01:22:42.658 region:rollup2
WHERE WE LOOKED AT.

01:22:39.988 --> 01:22:43.959 region:rollup2
LABOR MARKET DESTRUCTION.

01:22:42.658 --> 01:22:45.761 region:rollup2
HER EVERY DECADE IN THE US

01:22:43.959 --> 01:22:48.397 region:rollup2
ECONOMY FROM EIGHTEEN FIFTY TO

01:22:45.761 --> 01:22:49.765 region:rollup2
THE TO TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN.

01:22:48.397 --> 01:22:51.633 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT IN

01:22:49.765 --> 01:22:53.936 region:rollup2
PRIOR DECADE LIKE IN THE AGE IN

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:54.837 region:rollup2
THE NINETEEN FIFTIES EARLY

01:22:53.936 --> 01:22:58.841 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETIES.

01:22:54.837 --> 01:23:01.076 region:rollup2
pOCCUPATIONAL CHURNING OF.

01:22:58.841 --> 01:23:02.010 region:rollup2
JOBS JUST BEING DESTROYED BY

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:04.079 region:rollup2
NEW TECHNOLOGY.

01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:05.848 region:rollup2
.

01:23:04.079 --> 01:23:07.483 region:rollup2
FARMING FOR EXAMPLE WAS A GOOD

01:23:05.848 --> 01:23:08.317 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF THAT THE OTHER ONES

01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:09.818 region:rollup2
PEOPLE FORGET IN THE NINETEEN

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:12.955 region:rollup2
FIFTIES THE SIXTIES THERE WERE A

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:15.190 region:rollup2
LOT OF. JOBS THAT PEOPLE THAT IN

01:23:12.955 --> 01:23:16.225 region:rollup2
OFFICE IS CALLED FILE CLERK.

01:23:15.190 --> 01:23:18.560 region:rollup2
PETER CAME ALONG THEY WERE NO

01:23:16.225 --> 01:23:20.262 region:rollup2
MORE JOBS. AS FILE CLERK.

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:22.030 region:rollup2
SO THEN WHAT WE'VE BEEN

01:23:20.262 --> 01:23:23.832 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING IS NOT ANYTHING

01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:25.834 region:rollup2
NEAR WHAT WE HAVE HAD IN THE

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:28.437 region:rollup2
PAST IN THE PAST WE'VE DEALT

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:30.506 region:rollup2
WITH IT REASONABLY WELL.

01:23:28.437 --> 01:23:30.739 region:rollup2
I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS TODAY

01:23:30.506 --> 01:23:33.041 region:rollup2
THOUGH.

01:23:30.739 --> 01:23:35.210 region:rollup2
IS.

01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:37.379 region:rollup2
HOW ARE WE GOING TO COPE WITHIN

01:23:35.210 --> 01:23:38.947 region:rollup2
AND INEVITABLE INCREASE IN THE

01:23:37.379 --> 01:23:40.516 region:rollup2
RATE OF OCCUPATIONAL LABOR

01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:42.584 region:rollup2
MARKET DESTRUCTION?

01:23:40.516 --> 01:23:44.319 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKELY IN FIVE TO TEN YEARS

01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:47.189 region:rollup2
IT BE TECHNOLOGIES GET A LITTLE

01:23:44.319 --> 01:23:48.657 region:rollup2
BIT BETTER GET MORE WIDELY

01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:50.225 region:rollup2
DIFFUSED IN THE MARKETPLACE.

01:23:48.657 --> 01:23:52.060 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE MORE

01:23:50.225 --> 01:23:52.928 region:rollup2
JOBS LOST BECAUSE OF

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:55.163 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVITY.

01:23:52.928 --> 01:23:58.133 region:rollup2
AND CERTAIN OCCUPATIONS.

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:59.735 region:rollup2
IMPACTED MORE THAN OTHERS.

01:23:58.133 --> 01:24:00.335 region:rollup2
THERE'S A STUDY THAT WE'VE WE'VE

01:23:59.735 --> 01:24:02.638 region:rollup2
DONE.

01:24:00.335 --> 01:24:05.240 region:rollup2
FOR PAPER WE PRESENTED FOR THE

01:24:02.638 --> 01:24:06.441 region:rollup2
G. SEVEN CONFERENCE IS COMING UP

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:08.410 region:rollup2
IN MONTREAL WHERE.

01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:10.245 region:rollup2
WE LOOKED AT THE OXFORD

01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:11.947 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY ESTIMATES WHICH WE

01:24:10.245 --> 01:24:13.282 region:rollup2
THINK ARE WAY TOO HIGH BUT THEY

01:24:11.947 --> 01:24:15.984 region:rollup2
DID RIGHT OCCUPATIONS IN THE

01:24:13.282 --> 01:24:17.586 region:rollup2
LAST BY RISK AND WE ALSO. LIKE

01:24:15.984 --> 01:24:19.788 region:rollup2
YEAH I F. WE DID OUR OWN STUDY

01:24:17.586 --> 01:24:20.756 region:rollup2
WHERE WE RANK OCCUPATIONS AT

01:24:19.788 --> 01:24:22.024 region:rollup2
RISK.

01:24:20.756 --> 01:24:23.892 region:rollup2
I BY THE WAY I WOULD POINT OUT

01:24:22.024 --> 01:24:25.627 region:rollup2
THAT THE STUDY THAT WE DID OF

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:27.563 region:rollup2
THE STUDY THAT THE OECD DID IN

01:24:25.627 --> 01:24:28.730 region:rollup2
PARIS. AND THE MCKINSEY STUDY

01:24:27.563 --> 01:24:30.332 region:rollup2
THAT LINE HE REFERRED YOU ALL

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:32.734 region:rollup2
CAME UP WITH PRETTY MUCH THE

01:24:30.332 --> 01:24:35.103 region:rollup2
EXACT SAME NUMBER. ABOUT FIFTEEN

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:36.204 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF JOBS. THAT RISK BEING

01:24:35.103 --> 01:24:39.374 region:rollup2
LOST FROM TECHNOLOGY OVER THE

01:24:36.204 --> 01:24:41.043 region:rollup2
NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS OR SO.

01:24:39.374 --> 01:24:41.944 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT WE DID WITH THIS WITH

01:24:41.043 --> 01:24:43.445 region:rollup2
OUR STUDY IN LOOKING AT THE

01:24:41.944 --> 01:24:44.947 region:rollup2
MACKENZIE HE SAID IF WE LOOK AT.

01:24:43.445 --> 01:24:47.516 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

01:24:44.947 --> 01:24:49.418 region:rollup2
DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS AND THE REST

01:24:47.516 --> 01:24:51.320 region:rollup2
OF LOSING YOUR JOB IN THE FUTURE

01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:53.455 region:rollup2
FROM TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT WE

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:54.323 region:rollup2
FOUND AGAIN AND EAGER. TO BE

01:24:53.455 --> 01:24:55.724 region:rollup2
BIGGER CORRELATIONS.

01:24:54.323 --> 01:24:57.859 region:rollup2
UP THERE IS NO CORRELATION

01:24:55.724 --> 01:24:59.061 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY BETWEEN GENDER.

01:24:57.859 --> 01:24:59.895 region:rollup2
SO MEN AND WOMEN HAVE ABOUT THE

01:24:59.061 --> 01:25:01.863 region:rollup2
SAME DRESS.

01:24:59.895 --> 01:25:04.199 region:rollup2
THERE IS A NEGATIVE CORRELATION

01:25:01.863 --> 01:25:06.335 region:rollup2
WITH AGE WHICH IS A GOOD THING

01:25:04.199 --> 01:25:07.970 region:rollup2
ARE OLDER WORKERS WERE HANDED BE

01:25:06.335 --> 01:25:09.705 region:rollup2
AN OCCUPATION THAT WERE LESS AT

01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:10.706 region:rollup2
RISK OF AUTOMATION THAN YOUNGER

01:25:09.705 --> 01:25:12.207 region:rollup2
WORKERS.

01:25:10.706 --> 01:25:13.375 region:rollup2
OLDER WORKERS HAVE A HARDER TIME

01:25:12.207 --> 01:25:14.409 region:rollup2
MAKING TRANSITIONS SO THAT'S

01:25:13.375 --> 01:25:17.446 region:rollup2
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

01:25:14.409 --> 01:25:19.147 region:rollup2
.

01:25:17.446 --> 01:25:20.582 region:rollup2
WELL THERE IS NO REAL OF. IT A

01:25:19.147 --> 01:25:22.184 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF THERE WAS A LITTLE

01:25:20.582 --> 01:25:23.986 region:rollup2
BIT OF CORRELATION WITH RACE.

01:25:22.184 --> 01:25:25.253 region:rollup2
SO I HISPANIC AND AFRICAN

01:25:23.986 --> 01:25:27.322 region:rollup2
AMERICAN HANDED TO BE AN

01:25:25.253 --> 01:25:29.057 region:rollup2
OCCUPATION THAT WERE HAD A

01:25:27.322 --> 01:25:31.793 region:rollup2
HIGHER RISK OF AUTOMATION.

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:33.395 region:rollup2
UP BUT WHEN YOU CONTROL FOR WAGE

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:33.895 region:rollup2
AND IN AND EDUCATION LEVELS

01:25:33.395 --> 01:25:37.099 region:rollup2
RATES.

01:25:33.895 --> 01:25:38.033 region:rollup2
WENT AWAY THE BIGGEST FACTOR

01:25:37.099 --> 01:25:40.335 region:rollup2
THAT WE FOUND IS THAT.

01:25:38.033 --> 01:25:42.337 region:rollup2
THE RESCUED REALLY MUCH MORE

01:25:40.335 --> 01:25:44.473 region:rollup2
ORIENTED TO LOW WAGE. LOWER

01:25:42.337 --> 01:25:45.073 region:rollup2
SKILLED OCCUPATIONS.

01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:46.942 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THERE

01:25:45.073 --> 01:25:48.377 region:rollup2
WON'T BE IMPACTS IT ACROSS THE

01:25:46.942 --> 01:25:50.045 region:rollup2
INCOME.

01:25:48.377 --> 01:25:51.847 region:rollup2
AND OCCUPATIONAL SPECTRUM.

01:25:50.045 --> 01:25:53.782 region:rollup2
BUT IT APPEARS THAT THE BIGGEST

01:25:51.847 --> 01:25:54.416 region:rollup2
IMPACTS ARE GOING TO BE AT LOW

01:25:53.782 --> 01:26:00.022 region:rollup2
WAGE WORKERS ARE LOWER PATIENTS

01:25:54.416 --> 01:26:01.356 region:rollup2
ARE ON THE ONE SIDE

01:26:00.022 --> 01:26:02.357 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:03.692 region:rollup2
IS GOOD.

01:26:02.357 --> 01:26:05.660 region:rollup2
IN THE SENSE THAT IT WILL SHIFT

01:26:03.692 --> 01:26:06.862 region:rollup2
THE ECONOMY MORE TOWARD MIDDLE

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:08.497 region:rollup2
WAGE JOBS.

01:26:06.862 --> 01:26:10.132 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD TO PAY PEOPLE WELL IN

01:26:08.497 --> 01:26:11.767 region:rollup2
LOW WAGE JOBS BECAUSE

01:26:10.132 --> 01:26:13.068 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVITY THOUGHT HIGHER.

01:26:11.767 --> 01:26:14.803 region:rollup2
BUT AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE IN

01:26:13.068 --> 01:26:16.438 region:rollup2
LOW WAGE JOBS AND WITH LOWER

01:26:14.803 --> 01:26:18.707 region:rollup2
SKILL LEVELS HAVE A HARDER TIME

01:26:16.438 --> 01:26:20.942 region:rollup2
MAKING TRANSITIONS.

01:26:18.707 --> 01:26:23.478 region:rollup2
SO LET ME SUGGEST WHAT THAT

01:26:20.942 --> 01:26:25.814 region:rollup2
IMPLIES I THINK FOR.

01:26:23.478 --> 01:26:27.249 region:rollup2
WHAT CALIFORNIA CAN DO AND

01:26:25.814 --> 01:26:28.717 region:rollup2
FRANKLY WHAT THE FEDERAL

01:26:27.249 --> 01:26:30.686 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DOING? TO

01:26:28.717 --> 01:26:32.954 region:rollup2
MAKE IT EASIER FOR WORKERS TO

01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:34.389 region:rollup2
MAKE THESE TRANSITIONS.

01:26:32.954 --> 01:26:36.158 region:rollup2
WE REALLY STILL REPORTED I YEAH

01:26:34.389 --> 01:26:37.726 region:rollup2
I HAVE TWO WEEKS AGO THAT LAID

01:26:36.158 --> 01:26:40.128 region:rollup2
OUT A COMPREHENSIVE AGENDA.

01:26:37.726 --> 01:26:41.196 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS ORIENTED AROUND TWO

01:26:40.128 --> 01:26:43.465 region:rollup2
OR THREE DAY THINK ONE THE FIRST

01:26:41.196 --> 01:26:44.833 region:rollup2
ONE WAS REALLY ENSURE THAT

01:26:43.465 --> 01:26:47.502 region:rollup2
WORKERS HAVE BETTER SKILLS.

01:26:44.833 --> 01:26:48.970 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEY LOSE THEIR JOBS.

01:26:47.502 --> 01:26:50.706 region:rollup2
ONCE A WORKER LOSES THEIR JOB IT

01:26:48.970 --> 01:26:52.941 region:rollup2
IS HARDER TO DO THINGS THAT THEY

01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:55.177 region:rollup2
HAVE STRONGER CAPABILITIES

01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:56.445 region:rollup2
COMPETENCIES AND SKILLS.

01:26:55.177 --> 01:26:57.913 region:rollup2
IF YOU'VE HEARD ON THE GO AND

01:26:56.445 --> 01:26:59.414 region:rollup2
MAKE A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION.

01:26:57.913 --> 01:27:00.916 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE KEY THINGS WITHOUT WE

01:26:59.414 --> 01:27:03.051 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IT'S GIVING WORKERS.

01:27:00.916 --> 01:27:05.220 region:rollup2
GIVING STUDENTS I SHOULD SAY

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:07.122 region:rollup2
AND EVEN ADULT WORKERS STRONGER

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:08.590 region:rollup2
DIGITAL SKILLS.

01:27:07.122 --> 01:27:10.592 region:rollup2
IT'S STRIKING TO US SO THAT I

01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:11.860 region:rollup2
DON'T I JUST USES BECAUSE THE

01:27:10.592 --> 01:27:13.028 region:rollup2
DATE IS THERE BUT I ALL STATES

01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:14.830 region:rollup2
ARE SIMILAR TO THIS BUT IT'S

01:27:13.028 --> 01:27:15.864 region:rollup2
STRIKING THAT IN CALIFORNIA FOR

01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:17.466 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE.

01:27:15.864 --> 01:27:19.234 region:rollup2
MORE A LARGER SHARE OF HIGH

01:27:17.466 --> 01:27:21.036 region:rollup2
SCHOOL STUDENTS TAKE POTTERY.

01:27:19.234 --> 01:27:23.939 region:rollup2
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

01:27:21.036 --> 01:27:26.108 region:rollup2
THEN TAKE COMPUTER SCIENCE.

01:27:23.939 --> 01:27:28.076 region:rollup2
ISSUES THEN I THINK A PROBLEM.

01:27:26.108 --> 01:27:30.178 region:rollup2
I THINK WE NEED MORE OF OUR

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:31.346 region:rollup2
CHILDREN MORE OF OUR STUDENTS

01:27:30.178 --> 01:27:33.348 region:rollup2
TAKING COMPUTER SCIENCE.

01:27:31.346 --> 01:27:34.216 region:rollup2
EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT OF AMERICAN

01:27:33.348 --> 01:27:36.752 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TAKE

01:27:34.216 --> 01:27:38.587 region:rollup2
GEOMETRY BUT ONLY EIGHT PERCENT

01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:39.354 region:rollup2
TAKE STATISTICS.

01:27:38.587 --> 01:27:41.189 region:rollup2
AGAIN I WOULD ARGUE THESE

01:27:39.354 --> 01:27:43.225 region:rollup2
STATISTICS IS REALLY ONE OF

01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:44.493 region:rollup2
THOSE CORE SKILLS OR KNOWLEDGE

01:27:43.225 --> 01:27:46.161 region:rollup2
SAYS THAT WORKERS NEED TO KNOW

01:27:44.493 --> 01:27:48.230 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY'RE OPERATING A

01:27:46.161 --> 01:27:49.498 region:rollup2
MACHINE AND INDUSTRY FOUR POINT

01:27:48.230 --> 01:27:51.133 region:rollup2
OH SMART MANUFACTURING

01:27:49.498 --> 01:27:54.569 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT. OR WHETHER THEY'RE

01:27:51.133 --> 01:27:56.304 region:rollup2
IN A HOSPITAL WORKING ON ON THAT

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:58.206 region:rollup2
TESTING MACHINES.

01:27:56.304 --> 01:28:00.242 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE COURSE HILL YET WE

01:27:58.206 --> 01:28:01.576 region:rollup2
DON'T TEACH IT IN HIGH SCHOOL.

01:28:00.242 --> 01:28:03.478 region:rollup2
SO I THINK REACHED AS MONEY

01:28:01.576 --> 01:28:04.746 region:rollup2
AGAIN LINDA RETHINKING.

01:28:03.478 --> 01:28:06.047 region:rollup2
NOT JUST YOU CAN CALL BUT HIGHER

01:28:04.746 --> 01:28:09.584 region:rollup2
EDUCATION HOW WELL WE'RE DOING

01:28:06.047 --> 01:28:12.254 region:rollup2
IN. IMPARTING OR SKILLS.

01:28:09.584 --> 01:28:13.755 region:rollup2
A SECOND IS TO DO A BETTER JOB

01:28:12.254 --> 01:28:15.524 region:rollup2
OF SECOND BIGGER DOING A BETTER

01:28:13.755 --> 01:28:16.792 region:rollup2
JOB OF HELPING WORKERS WHEN THEY

01:28:15.524 --> 01:28:19.161 region:rollup2
DO LOSE THEIR JOBS FROM

01:28:16.792 --> 01:28:20.862 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY.

01:28:19.161 --> 01:28:22.464 region:rollup2
OUT WELL EVERY STATE IN THE

01:28:20.862 --> 01:28:24.199 region:rollup2
NATION HAVE THE REQUIREMENT TO

01:28:22.464 --> 01:28:26.434 region:rollup2
ALLOW WORKERS TO GET

01:28:24.199 --> 01:28:29.437 region:rollup2
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE TO ALSO

01:28:26.434 --> 01:28:30.605 region:rollup2
BE INVOLVED IN TRAINING. AFTER

01:28:29.437 --> 01:28:33.008 region:rollup2
THEY LOSE THEIR JOB.

01:28:30.605 --> 01:28:35.143 region:rollup2
MOST STATES AND I BELIEVE

01:28:33.008 --> 01:28:37.345 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS IN THIS CAMP.

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:38.814 region:rollup2
DON'T ACTIVELY WORKED TO ALLOW

01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:39.815 region:rollup2
AND ENCOURAGE WORKERS WHO ARE

01:28:38.814 --> 01:28:41.950 region:rollup2
LAID OFF.

01:28:39.815 --> 01:28:43.652 region:rollup2
GET TRAINING.

01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:45.120 region:rollup2
THE INCENTIVE FOR MOST STATES

01:28:43.652 --> 01:28:46.321 region:rollup2
IS IT IS YEAH WORKERS BACK IN

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:48.223 region:rollup2
THE WORKFORCE AS QUICKLY AS

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:49.591 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE TO KEEP YOU WHY COSTS

01:28:48.223 --> 01:28:51.092 region:rollup2
DOWN.

01:28:49.591 --> 01:28:52.794 region:rollup2
THEIR MENTION GOOD STUDIES AT A

01:28:51.092 --> 01:28:54.296 region:rollup2
SHOW THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT

01:28:52.794 --> 01:28:56.164 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMMISSION OTHER

01:28:54.296 --> 01:28:57.933 region:rollup2
STATES ARE JUST SIMPLY SEND THE

01:28:56.164 --> 01:28:59.301 region:rollup2
LETTER TO WORKERS WHEN THEY

01:28:57.933 --> 01:29:01.403 region:rollup2
COLLECT WHEN THEY APPLY FOR YOU

01:28:59.301 --> 01:29:04.673 region:rollup2
WHY. TO JUST LET THEM KNOW THAT

01:29:01.403 --> 01:29:05.574 region:rollup2
THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR TRAINING.

01:29:04.673 --> 01:29:06.975 region:rollup2
BOTHER COLLECTING UNEMPLOYMENT

01:29:05.574 --> 01:29:09.010 region:rollup2
INSURANCE.

01:29:06.975 --> 01:29:11.413 region:rollup2
THAT'S TRAINING INVOLVEMENT GOES

01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:12.781 region:rollup2
UP BY FORTY PERCENT.

01:29:11.413 --> 01:29:14.382 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT AN EASY SIX THIS

01:29:12.781 --> 01:29:16.151 region:rollup2
THE BEST TIME FOR WORKERS TO BE

01:29:14.382 --> 01:29:17.552 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN TRAINING BECAUSE

01:29:16.151 --> 01:29:19.321 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T HAVE A JOB AND THEY

01:29:17.552 --> 01:29:19.688 region:rollup2
HAVE TIME AND THEY HAVE SOME

01:29:19.321 --> 01:29:21.656 region:rollup2
INCOME SUPPORT.

01:29:19.688 --> 01:29:22.257 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:29:21.656 --> 01:29:23.325 region:rollup2
THE ONE THING I WOULD SUGGEST

01:29:22.257 --> 01:29:25.060 region:rollup2
IN.

01:29:23.325 --> 01:29:27.028 region:rollup2
WE REALLY DO NEED TO DO A MUCH

01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:28.163 region:rollup2
BETTER JOB OF PROVIDING ONLINE

01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:29.931 region:rollup2
TOOLS.

01:29:28.163 --> 01:29:31.499 region:rollup2
FOR WORKERS

01:29:29.931 --> 01:29:33.568 region:rollup2
TO HELP THEM WITH THINGS LIKE

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:35.370 region:rollup2
SKILL ASSESSMENTS.

01:29:33.568 --> 01:29:37.472 region:rollup2
FINDING TRAINING RESOURCES DOING

01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:39.441 region:rollup2
JOB SEARCHES.

01:29:37.472 --> 01:29:40.008 region:rollup2
I EVERY STATE HAS ESSENTIALLY OF

01:29:39.441 --> 01:29:42.277 region:rollup2
WHAT'S CALLED AN ONLINE ONE

01:29:40.008 --> 01:29:42.510 region:rollup2
STOP.

01:29:42.277 --> 01:29:44.079 region:rollup2

01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:45.513 region:rollup2
.

01:29:44.079 --> 01:29:47.249 region:rollup2
I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT CALIFORNIA'S

01:29:45.513 --> 01:29:48.350 region:rollup2
BUT I'VE LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF

01:29:47.249 --> 01:29:50.552 region:rollup2
STATES AND THEIR FRANKLY NOT

01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:52.254 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD.

01:29:50.552 --> 01:29:54.522 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T PROVIDE AN EASY TO

01:29:52.254 --> 01:29:56.424 region:rollup2
USE INTERFACES REALLY HARD FOR

01:29:54.522 --> 01:29:57.459 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO USE THAT.

01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:58.860 region:rollup2
AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK TO

01:29:57.459 --> 01:30:00.795 region:rollup2
LOOK AT OF OR TO HAVE YOUR

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:02.230 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR LOOK AT WHAT

01:30:00.795 --> 01:30:03.298 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE MORE IT MORE

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:05.367 region:rollup2
INTERESTING PUBLIC PRIVATE

01:30:03.298 --> 01:30:06.835 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP MODEL DOING NOW AND

01:30:05.367 --> 01:30:07.903 region:rollup2
IN PARTICULAR.

01:30:06.835 --> 01:30:10.272 region:rollup2
A PROGRAM THAT.

01:30:07.903 --> 01:30:11.539 region:rollup2
THE MARKLE FOUNDATION.

01:30:10.272 --> 01:30:13.108 region:rollup2
REPORTING IN COLORADO WITH THE

01:30:11.539 --> 01:30:15.910 region:rollup2
MICROSOFT.

01:30:13.108 --> 01:30:17.445 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION AND LINK IN.

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:19.247 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY CREATED OF SYSTEM

01:30:17.445 --> 01:30:20.682 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY STATE OF THE ART

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:22.484 region:rollup2
ONLINE PORTAL?

01:30:20.682 --> 01:30:24.786 region:rollup2
WORKERS CAN GO ON THEIR THEY CAN

01:30:22.484 --> 01:30:26.788 region:rollup2
DO ON ONLINE SKILLS ASSESSMENT.

01:30:24.786 --> 01:30:29.157 region:rollup2
TELL THEM WHERE THEY'RE WE WHERE

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:30.492 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STRONG WHERE THEY NEED

01:30:29.157 --> 01:30:31.826 region:rollup2
TO GET SOME ADDITIONAL HEALTH.

01:30:30.492 --> 01:30:33.795 region:rollup2
THEY CAN SAY WHAT OCCUPATION

01:30:31.826 --> 01:30:35.630 region:rollup2
THAT THAT END AND THEY CANNOT

01:30:33.795 --> 01:30:37.699 region:rollup2
FIND AYE SIMILAR OCCUPATIONS

01:30:35.630 --> 01:30:39.467 region:rollup2
WHERE THE SKILL AT EDITIONS

01:30:37.699 --> 01:30:41.970 region:rollup2
AREN'T ALL THAT GREAT. THEY CAN

01:30:39.467 --> 01:30:43.905 region:rollup2
FIND VERY EASILY ONLINE TRAIN A

01:30:41.970 --> 01:30:47.342 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT FIND ONLINE TRAINING

01:30:43.905 --> 01:30:48.476 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO GET INVOLVED IN.

01:30:47.342 --> 01:30:51.313 region:rollup2
TO ME EVERY STATE SHOULD HAVE

01:30:48.476 --> 01:30:53.448 region:rollup2
THE ROBUST ONLINE EASY TO USE

01:30:51.313 --> 01:30:53.648 region:rollup2
SYSTEM FOR WORKERS AND I THINK

01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:55.283 region:rollup2
IT'S.

01:30:53.648 --> 01:30:57.886 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE CAN DO STATES IS

01:30:55.283 --> 01:30:59.254 region:rollup2
LIKE TO DO THAT BUT FRANKLY WE

01:30:57.886 --> 01:31:00.889 region:rollup2
JUST HAVEN'T DONE IT YET.

01:30:59.254 --> 01:31:02.057 region:rollup2
OTHERS CLOSE BY SAYING ARE

01:31:00.889 --> 01:31:03.892 region:rollup2
AGREEING WITH LENNY I THINK WE

01:31:02.057 --> 01:31:05.894 region:rollup2
SHOULD ALL THE STATE OF. DEEP

01:31:03.892 --> 01:31:07.362 region:rollup2
BREATHS AND CALM DOWN THE THESE

01:31:05.894 --> 01:31:08.530 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY TRANSITIONS TAKE

01:31:07.362 --> 01:31:10.565 region:rollup2
LONGER THAN WE THINK.

01:31:08.530 --> 01:31:11.933 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN I THINK WE

01:31:10.565 --> 01:31:13.635 region:rollup2
WILL COPE WITH THAT WE WON'T

01:31:11.933 --> 01:31:15.937 region:rollup2
HAVE HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT. WE

01:31:13.635 --> 01:31:17.505 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE I WOULD ARGUE HIGHER

01:31:15.937 --> 01:31:19.107 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVITY AND WAGE GROWTH.

01:31:17.505 --> 01:31:21.776 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO NEED A MUCH BETTER

01:31:19.107 --> 01:31:22.410 region:rollup2
SYSTEM FOR HELPING WORKERS MAKE

01:31:21.776 --> 01:31:22.977 region:rollup2
THAT LEADS TRANSITIONS THAT ARE

01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:25.213 region:rollup2

01:31:42.564 --> 01:31:46.101 region:rollup2
COUNCIL SEVEN WHICH COVERS A

01:31:44.232 --> 01:31:47.736 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THOUSAND TEAMSTERS FROM

01:31:46.101 --> 01:31:48.803 region:rollup2
BAKERSFIELD UP TO THE OREGON

01:31:47.736 --> 01:31:50.505 region:rollup2
BORDER.

01:31:48.803 --> 01:31:52.107 region:rollup2
AND FOR PURPOSES OF THIS

01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:54.476 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION I WANNA FOCUS ON OUR

01:31:52.107 --> 01:31:56.711 region:rollup2
MEMBERS WHO ARE DRIVING TRUCKS.

01:31:54.476 --> 01:31:58.646 region:rollup2
BUSES AND TRAINS.

01:31:56.711 --> 01:32:00.815 region:rollup2
AND FIRST LET ME SAY HOW HAPPY I

AM TO BE HERE TODAY BECAUSE I'M

01:32:00.815 --> 01:32:04.886 region:rollup2
SPENDING ABOUT HALF OF MY TIME

01:32:02.684 --> 01:32:06.855 region:rollup2
ON THESE ISSUES.

01:32:04.886 --> 01:32:08.790 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOW CRITICAL THEY ARE OF

01:32:06.855 --> 01:32:10.825 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE TO THE TEAMSTERS

01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:12.093 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY JUST CAME FROM.

01:32:10.825 --> 01:32:13.461 region:rollup2
BARGAINING WITH UNITED PARCEL

01:32:12.093 --> 01:32:16.264 region:rollup2
SERVICE AT.

01:32:13.461 --> 01:32:18.199 region:rollup2
THE HILTON OFF OF ARDEN WAY.

01:32:16.264 --> 01:32:19.367 region:rollup2
WE ARE IN BARGAINING WITH UPS

01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:20.635 region:rollup2
IT'S THE SINGLE LARGEST

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:22.270 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT

01:32:20.635 --> 01:32:22.837 region:rollup2
IN THE COUNTRY.

01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:25.006 region:rollup2
COVERS.

01:32:22.837 --> 01:32:27.075 region:rollup2
OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:32:25.006 --> 01:32:28.610 region:rollup2
THOUSAND WORKERS.

01:32:27.075 --> 01:32:31.379 region:rollup2
AND OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE ISSUES

01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:33.748 region:rollup2
WE'VE BARGAIN ON AROUND IS THE

01:32:31.379 --> 01:32:36.117 region:rollup2
INTRODUCTION USE OF TECHNOLOGY.

01:32:33.748 --> 01:32:37.986 region:rollup2
WHETHER THINGS LIKE DASH CAMS OR

01:32:36.117 --> 01:32:40.655 region:rollup2
AUTOMATED SPEED CONTROLS OR

01:32:37.986 --> 01:32:42.524 region:rollup2
ROUTING SOFTWARE AND GPS ARE

01:32:40.655 --> 01:32:44.793 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT CAN ACTUALLY HELP.

01:32:42.524 --> 01:32:46.928 region:rollup2
MAKE OUR MEMBERS MORE PRODUCTIVE

01:32:44.793 --> 01:32:49.264 region:rollup2
OR SIMPLY TOOLS TO DISCIPLINE

01:32:46.928 --> 01:32:51.499 region:rollup2
THEM. AND SOMETIMES THEY DESERVE

01:32:49.264 --> 01:32:53.068 region:rollup2
TO BE DISCIPLINED SO EXACTLY HOW

01:32:51.499 --> 01:32:53.868 region:rollup2
DOES THAT WORK WHEN YOU USE

01:32:53.068 --> 01:32:56.271 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY.

01:32:53.868 --> 01:32:58.306 region:rollup2
.

01:32:56.271 --> 01:33:00.008 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT.

01:32:58.306 --> 01:33:01.810 region:rollup2
EVERYDAY I OUR MEMBERS DRIVING

01:33:00.008 --> 01:33:03.845 region:rollup2
TRUCKS.

01:33:01.810 --> 01:33:07.048 region:rollup2
OR ANY VEHICLES HAVE TO MAKE

01:33:03.845 --> 01:33:08.116 region:rollup2
DECISIONS AND IN A SPLIT SECOND

01:33:07.048 --> 01:33:09.517 region:rollup2
ON WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO

01:33:08.116 --> 01:33:11.252 region:rollup2
PROTECT.

01:33:09.517 --> 01:33:12.587 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY ON THE ROAD THAT'S IN

01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:14.322 region:rollup2
FRONT OF THEM OR PROTECT THE

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:16.791 region:rollup2
CARGO.

01:33:14.322 --> 01:33:18.560 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS A DECISION THAT

01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:20.995 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IS LEFT UP TO HUMANS

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:22.764 region:rollup2
AND NOT AN ALGORITHM SO I AGREE

01:33:20.995 --> 01:33:24.065 region:rollup2
WITH THE ORIGINAL.

01:33:22.764 --> 01:33:26.434 region:rollup2
SPEAKER THAT THESE ARE HEAVY

01:33:24.065 --> 01:33:28.937 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

01:33:26.434 --> 01:33:30.839 region:rollup2
NOW. AMAZON IS U. P. S.'S

01:33:28.937 --> 01:33:33.274 region:rollup2
LARGEST CUSTOMER.

01:33:30.839 --> 01:33:34.742 region:rollup2
AND AMAZON IS PATENTED A HIGHWAY

01:33:33.274 --> 01:33:35.844 region:rollup2
NETWORK THAT CONTROL SELF

01:33:34.742 --> 01:33:37.712 region:rollup2
DRIVING TRUCKS

01:33:35.844 --> 01:33:39.814 region:rollup2
AND CARS.

01:33:37.712 --> 01:33:42.117 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DEVELOPING AN APT TO

01:33:39.814 --> 01:33:44.052 region:rollup2
MATCH THE DELIVERIES WITH

01:33:42.117 --> 01:33:45.753 region:rollup2
SHIPMENTS FROM THE DISTRIBUTION

01:33:44.052 --> 01:33:46.688 region:rollup2
CENTERS THEIR TESTING DRONES

01:33:45.753 --> 01:33:48.456 region:rollup2
THEIR AUTOMATING THEIR

01:33:46.688 --> 01:33:52.494 region:rollup2
WAREHOUSES.

01:33:48.456 --> 01:33:54.429 region:rollup2
UPS IS RIGHT THERE WITH AMAZON.

01:33:52.494 --> 01:33:56.631 region:rollup2
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT ASSEMBLY

01:33:54.429 --> 01:33:58.199 region:rollup2
MEMBER BERMAN. I HAD TO LEAVE

01:33:56.631 --> 01:34:01.236 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WORKED WITH HIM LAST

01:33:58.199 --> 01:34:03.338 region:rollup2
YEAR ON A BILL AB SIX SIX NINE.

01:34:01.236 --> 01:34:05.607 region:rollup2
WHICH ALLOWED FOR.

01:34:03.338 --> 01:34:07.876 region:rollup2
PERMITTING OF OF TESTING FOR

01:34:05.607 --> 01:34:09.310 region:rollup2
DRIVERLESS TRUCK PLATOONS BY A

01:34:07.876 --> 01:34:11.646 region:rollup2
MOUNTAIN VIEW BASED COMPANY

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:15.316 region:rollup2
CALLED PELOTON TECHNOLOGY.

01:34:11.646 --> 01:34:17.519 region:rollup2
WHICH U. P. S. HAS INVESTED IN.

01:34:15.316 --> 01:34:20.288 region:rollup2
THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT THAT IS THAT

01:34:17.519 --> 01:34:23.057 region:rollup2
WE WORKED WITH MISTER BERMAN AND

01:34:20.288 --> 01:34:24.592 region:rollup2
AND WITH PALATINE SO THAT WHILE

01:34:23.057 --> 01:34:25.860 region:rollup2
THESE TRUCKS ARE BEING TESTED

01:34:24.592 --> 01:34:27.662 region:rollup2
THERE'S GOING TO BE A DRIVER

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:29.063 region:rollup2
WITH THE COMMERCIAL. DRIVER'S

01:34:27.662 --> 01:34:31.466 region:rollup2
LICENSE IN EVERY TRUCK AND IN

01:34:29.063 --> 01:34:33.735 region:rollup2
CASE YOU DON'T KNOW PLATOON IS A

01:34:31.466 --> 01:34:35.703 region:rollup2
CONVOY OF VEHICLES. WHERE YOU

01:34:33.735 --> 01:34:38.873 region:rollup2
HAVE A DRIVER IN THE FIRST TRUCK

01:34:35.703 --> 01:34:40.375 region:rollup2
WHO COULD? CONTROL ALL THE OTHER

01:34:38.873 --> 01:34:43.011 region:rollup2
TRUCKS BEHIND.

01:34:40.375 --> 01:34:45.079 region:rollup2
HIM OR HER WIRELESSLY.

01:34:43.011 --> 01:34:45.713 region:rollup2
BUT WHILE PELOTON IS TESTING

01:34:45.079 --> 01:34:48.483 region:rollup2
HERE.

01:34:45.713 --> 01:34:50.018 region:rollup2
THESE THERE'S A DRIVER IN EVERY

01:34:48.483 --> 01:34:52.020 region:rollup2
TRUCK AND IN FACT OUR

01:34:50.018 --> 01:34:53.755 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM AND OTHER

01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:55.523 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY. WE'RE

01:34:53.755 --> 01:34:58.726 region:rollup2
REALLY SEEING THIS IS TECHNOLOGY

01:34:55.523 --> 01:35:01.262 region:rollup2
THAT COULD ACTUALLY AUGMENT JOBS

01:34:58.726 --> 01:35:03.464 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF AUTOMATE THEM.

01:35:01.262 --> 01:35:05.667 region:rollup2
NOW AS I'VE TRAVELED FROM

01:35:03.464 --> 01:35:08.403 region:rollup2
SILICON VALLEY TO SAN FRANCISCO

01:35:05.667 --> 01:35:10.972 region:rollup2
TO SACRAMENTO TO D. C.. I LIKE

01:35:08.403 --> 01:35:12.340 region:rollup2
LENNY I KEEP HEARING ABOUT THIS

01:35:10.972 --> 01:35:14.108 region:rollup2
ROBOT APOCALYPSE NOW FOUR

01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:16.211 region:rollup2
MILLION TRANSPORTATION WORKERS

01:35:14.108 --> 01:35:17.779 region:rollup2
WHO LOSE THEIR JOBS IN THE NEXT

01:35:16.211 --> 01:35:19.013 region:rollup2
FIVE TO TWENTY YEARS.

01:35:17.779 --> 01:35:21.916 region:rollup2
AND.

01:35:19.013 --> 01:35:23.685 region:rollup2
I AGREE WITH OTHERS THAT THAT

01:35:21.916 --> 01:35:25.353 region:rollup2
THE ONLY THING INEVITABLE ABOUT

01:35:23.685 --> 01:35:26.588 region:rollup2
HERE ABOUT THIS IS THE

01:35:25.353 --> 01:35:29.257 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY.

01:35:26.588 --> 01:35:31.426 region:rollup2
THE OUTCOMES ATTACH TO THAT ARE

01:35:29.257 --> 01:35:33.194 region:rollup2
STILL UP IN THE AIR.

01:35:31.426 --> 01:35:36.664 region:rollup2
WE CAN DECIDE IF.

01:35:33.194 --> 01:35:38.866 region:rollup2
THIS TECHNOLOGY BENEFIT SOCIETY

01:35:36.664 --> 01:35:40.635 region:rollup2
IF IT BENEFITS WORKERS OR IF IT

01:35:38.866 --> 01:35:41.069 region:rollup2
JUST BENEFITS.

01:35:40.635 --> 01:35:42.737 region:rollup2
COMPANIES AND THEIR

01:35:41.069 --> 01:35:44.839 region:rollup2
SHAREHOLDERS.

01:35:42.737 --> 01:35:46.608 region:rollup2
TO BE BLUNT.

01:35:44.839 --> 01:35:49.043 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

01:35:46.608 --> 01:35:50.778 region:rollup2
THAT THE WORKERS.

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:53.414 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE A DRIVERLESS TRUCKS

01:35:50.778 --> 01:35:55.249 region:rollup2
THE TRUCK DRIVERS ARE HAVE A

01:35:53.414 --> 01:35:57.585 region:rollup2
SEAT AT THE TABLE.

01:35:55.249 --> 01:35:58.987 region:rollup2
IN ARE CONSULTED ON WHAT ARE THE

01:35:57.585 --> 01:36:01.789 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE

01:35:58.987 --> 01:36:04.258 region:rollup2
WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY.

01:36:01.789 --> 01:36:06.594 region:rollup2
SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

01:36:04.258 --> 01:36:08.763 region:rollup2
ABOUT DRIVERLESS TRUCKS IN

01:36:06.594 --> 01:36:10.098 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR AND AND. WHO ARE

01:36:08.763 --> 01:36:11.299 region:rollup2
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE

01:36:10.098 --> 01:36:14.035 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS AND WHETHER THE

01:36:11.299 --> 01:36:15.236 region:rollup2
SOLUTION OF AUTOMATION IS GOING

01:36:14.035 --> 01:36:17.238 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THINGS WORSE?

01:36:15.236 --> 01:36:18.773 region:rollup2
AND I'M AFRAID RIGHT NOW IT

01:36:17.238 --> 01:36:20.908 region:rollup2
LOOKS LIKE THE ANSWER TO THAT IS

01:36:18.773 --> 01:36:22.043 region:rollup2
YES.

01:36:20.908 --> 01:36:23.177 region:rollup2
THERE ARE PLENTY OF GOOD

01:36:22.043 --> 01:36:24.646 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS.

01:36:23.177 --> 01:36:27.348 region:rollup2
.

01:36:24.646 --> 01:36:28.850 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY REASONS COST SAVING

01:36:27.348 --> 01:36:31.919 region:rollup2
SAFER HIGHWAYS.

01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:33.621 region:rollup2
FOR DRIVERLESS TRUCKS.

01:36:31.919 --> 01:36:35.056 region:rollup2
BILL ONE OF THE JUSTIFICATIONS

01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:37.158 region:rollup2
WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT IS A

01:36:35.056 --> 01:36:38.559 region:rollup2
MASSIVE SHORTAGE OF AVAILABLE

01:36:37.158 --> 01:36:40.495 region:rollup2
TRUCK DRIVERS.

01:36:38.559 --> 01:36:43.564 region:rollup2
IN A LOOMING CRISIS AROUND AND

01:36:40.495 --> 01:36:44.732 region:rollup2
THAT'S TRUE FOR BUSES AS WELL.

01:36:43.564 --> 01:36:46.200 region:rollup2
SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHY

01:36:44.732 --> 01:36:48.069 region:rollup2
THESE JOBS ARE HARD TO FILL IN

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:50.004 region:rollup2
THE FIRST PLACE.

01:36:48.069 --> 01:36:51.005 region:rollup2
BEFORE DEREGULATION IN THE

01:36:50.004 --> 01:36:52.373 region:rollup2
NINETEEN EIGHTIES BY THE FEDERAL

01:36:51.005 --> 01:36:54.609 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

01:36:52.373 --> 01:36:55.910 region:rollup2
TRUCK DRIVING WAS A GOOD MIDDLE

01:36:54.609 --> 01:36:56.944 region:rollup2
CLASS BLUE COLLAR JOB FOR

01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:58.479 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY WITH VERY LITTLE

01:36:56.944 --> 01:37:00.281 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:36:58.479 --> 01:37:02.550 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I THAT MY DAD HAD A CB

01:37:00.281 --> 01:37:04.052 region:rollup2
RADIO IN HIS PICK UP TRUCK THERE

01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:06.521 region:rollup2
WERE SONGS ON THE RADIO ABOUT

01:37:04.052 --> 01:37:07.088 region:rollup2
TRUCK DRIVERS IT WAS KIND OF A

01:37:06.521 --> 01:37:08.656 region:rollup2
MYTH THE CALLED MIDDLE CLASS

01:37:07.088 --> 01:37:08.823 region:rollup2
JOB.

01:37:08.656 --> 01:37:10.725 region:rollup2
AND.

01:37:08.823 --> 01:37:12.794 region:rollup2
.

01:37:10.725 --> 01:37:14.162 region:rollup2
AFTER DO YOU WE WERE THE LARGEST

01:37:12.794 --> 01:37:15.463 region:rollup2
IN IN THE COUNTRY IN AFTER

01:37:14.162 --> 01:37:17.031 region:rollup2
DEREGULATION WE SHRANK TO

01:37:15.463 --> 01:37:18.966 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY.

01:37:17.031 --> 01:37:21.869 region:rollup2
THE PHOENIX THAT ROSE OUT OF THE

01:37:18.966 --> 01:37:23.671 region:rollup2
ASHES OF DEREGULATION WAS THIS

01:37:21.869 --> 01:37:25.440 region:rollup2
BUSINESS MODEL OF HIRING PEOPLE

01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:27.775 region:rollup2
AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:29.143 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF EMPLOYEES IN A TIE

01:37:27.775 --> 01:37:31.346 region:rollup2
THIS BACK TO A AYE.

01:37:29.143 --> 01:37:33.047 region:rollup2
AND AUTOMATION HERE.

01:37:31.346 --> 01:37:35.717 region:rollup2
AND OUT OF COURSE THIS IS THE

01:37:33.047 --> 01:37:37.885 region:rollup2
UBER AND LYFT BUSINESS MODEL SO

01:37:35.717 --> 01:37:40.521 region:rollup2
IT IT'S NOTHING NEW TO US.

01:37:37.885 --> 01:37:42.056 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT IT ENABLE THE TRUCKING

01:37:40.521 --> 01:37:44.058 region:rollup2
COMPANIES TO DO WAS TO.

01:37:42.056 --> 01:37:46.027 region:rollup2
SHIFT.

01:37:44.058 --> 01:37:48.196 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY SHIFT ALL THE COSTS

01:37:46.027 --> 01:37:50.264 region:rollup2
AND BURDENS ONTO THE BACKS OF

01:37:48.196 --> 01:37:51.999 region:rollup2
THE WORKERS FOR OWNING AND

01:37:50.264 --> 01:37:53.534 region:rollup2
OPERATING A TRUCK.

01:37:51.999 --> 01:37:54.602 region:rollup2
AND AS A SMALL BUSINESS UNDER

01:37:53.534 --> 01:37:56.637 region:rollup2
THE LAW AN INDEPENDENT

01:37:54.602 --> 01:37:58.139 region:rollup2
CONTRACTOR HAS NO RIGHT TO

01:37:56.637 --> 01:38:00.274 region:rollup2
ORGANIZE A UNION.

01:37:58.139 --> 01:38:01.909 region:rollup2
AND I I SHOULD SAY THERE IS A

01:38:00.274 --> 01:38:03.945 region:rollup2
TIME AND A PLACE FOR INDEPENDENT

01:38:01.909 --> 01:38:06.080 region:rollup2
CONTRACTING I'M JUST TALKING

01:38:03.945 --> 01:38:06.481 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS WITH TRUCK DRIVERS.

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:09.784 region:rollup2
AND.

01:38:06.481 --> 01:38:12.286 region:rollup2
STUDIES HAVE DOCUMENTED THAT IN

01:38:09.784 --> 01:38:14.021 region:rollup2
TIME IT WENT FROM A A GOOD JOB

01:38:12.286 --> 01:38:16.457 region:rollup2
TO ONE WHERE NOW THEY WORK

01:38:14.021 --> 01:38:17.959 region:rollup2
SEVENTY EIGHTY HOURS A WEEK THAT

01:38:16.457 --> 01:38:20.395 region:rollup2
NO SOCIAL SAFETY NET NO

01:38:17.959 --> 01:38:22.530 region:rollup2
UNEMPLOYMENT NO WORKERS COMP. NO

01:38:20.395 --> 01:38:24.165 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE NO BENEFITS NO

01:38:22.530 --> 01:38:25.700 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO NEGOTIATE AROUND THOSE

01:38:24.165 --> 01:38:26.300 region:rollup2
THINGS.

01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:27.735 region:rollup2
AND.

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:29.804 region:rollup2
THEY MAKE LESS THAN MINIMUM

01:38:27.735 --> 01:38:32.106 region:rollup2
WAGE.

01:38:29.804 --> 01:38:33.341 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NO WONDER THAT THEY

01:38:32.106 --> 01:38:35.977 region:rollup2
CAN'T FIND PEOPLE TO TAKE THESE

01:38:33.341 --> 01:38:37.979 region:rollup2
JOBS.

01:38:35.977 --> 01:38:40.581 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD.

01:38:37.979 --> 01:38:42.483 region:rollup2
SO HUMBLY SUGGEST THAT THE

01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:45.486 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY IS NOW USING DRIVERLESS

01:38:42.483 --> 01:38:47.755 region:rollup2
TRUCKS TO SOLVE A PROBLEM THAT

01:38:45.486 --> 01:38:49.924 region:rollup2
THEY THEMSELVES CREATED.

01:38:47.755 --> 01:38:52.226 region:rollup2
ARE AROUND THE BY DESTROYING THE

01:38:49.924 --> 01:38:55.062 region:rollup2
QUALITY OF THE JOBS.

01:38:52.226 --> 01:38:56.531 region:rollup2
SO THE QUESTION TO ME IS WILL

01:38:55.062 --> 01:38:58.699 region:rollup2
THIS TREND JUST FURTHER

01:38:56.531 --> 01:38:59.934 region:rollup2
EXACERBATE THIS PROBLEM.

01:38:58.699 --> 01:39:00.868 region:rollup2
AND I WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE

01:38:59.934 --> 01:39:03.538 region:rollup2
ATLANTIC.

01:39:00.868 --> 01:39:05.406 region:rollup2
MAGAZINE A FEW MONTHS AGO.

01:39:03.538 --> 01:39:07.408 region:rollup2
AND ASKED TO RESPOND TO A REPORT

01:39:05.406 --> 01:39:09.811 region:rollup2
BY UBER THAT PREDICTED AN ACTUAL

01:39:07.408 --> 01:39:11.979 region:rollup2
NET INCREASE IN JOBS DO THE SELF

01:39:09.811 --> 01:39:12.914 region:rollup2
DRIVING TRUCKS I BELIEVE THAT

01:39:11.979 --> 01:39:14.882 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY TO BE TRUE.

01:39:12.914 --> 01:39:16.651 region:rollup2
.

01:39:14.882 --> 01:39:17.251 region:rollup2
A.

01:39:16.651 --> 01:39:19.086 region:rollup2
IT I THINK IT'S MORE GOING TO

01:39:17.251 --> 01:39:21.022 region:rollup2
BE.

01:39:19.086 --> 01:39:23.357 region:rollup2
BECAUSE DRIVERLESS TRUCKS CANNOT

01:39:21.022 --> 01:39:25.059 region:rollup2
OPERATE IN AN URBAN ENVIRONMENT

01:39:23.357 --> 01:39:27.195 region:rollup2
AND SO THEY'RE GOING TO BE.

01:39:25.059 --> 01:39:29.163 region:rollup2
NEW JOBS THINK ABOUT THE AMAZON

01:39:27.195 --> 01:39:31.165 region:rollup2
FLAX DRIVER DOING DELIVERIES

01:39:29.163 --> 01:39:33.367 region:rollup2
OVER THE SHORT HAUL DRIVERS LIKE

01:39:31.165 --> 01:39:35.736 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AT THE PORTS OF LA LONG

01:39:33.367 --> 01:39:37.405 region:rollup2
BEACH IN OAKLAND.

01:39:35.736 --> 01:39:38.606 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM WITH THE REPORT.

01:39:37.405 --> 01:39:40.341 region:rollup2
IN MY OPINION WAS THAT WAS

01:39:38.606 --> 01:39:43.010 region:rollup2
TOTALLY SILENT ON THE ISSUE OF

01:39:40.341 --> 01:39:44.545 region:rollup2
JOB QUALITY.

01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:46.147 region:rollup2
FIRE WHETHER THESE JOBS CAN ARE

01:39:44.545 --> 01:39:47.982 region:rollup2
THEY GONNA BE GOOD UNION JOBS

01:39:46.147 --> 01:39:49.150 region:rollup2
THAT ARE CREATED ARE THEY GOING

01:39:47.982 --> 01:39:50.818 region:rollup2
TO BE MORE INDEPENDENT

01:39:49.150 --> 01:39:52.653 region:rollup2
CONTRACTOR JOBS.

01:39:50.818 --> 01:39:54.589 region:rollup2
HOW WILL THAT IMPACT OUR UPS

01:39:52.653 --> 01:39:54.956 region:rollup2
DRIVERS TO?

01:39:54.589 --> 01:39:57.291 region:rollup2
WHO?

01:39:54.956 --> 01:39:59.393 region:rollup2
ARE MAKING DECENT WAGES WITH A

01:39:57.291 --> 01:40:00.695 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA.

01:39:59.393 --> 01:40:03.331 region:rollup2
WITH FULLY PAID FAMILY HEALTH

01:40:00.695 --> 01:40:04.632 region:rollup2
CARE IN A PENSION.

01:40:03.331 --> 01:40:07.969 region:rollup2
I'M ALSO SKEPTICAL ABOUT

01:40:04.632 --> 01:40:09.103 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME AND I'M.

01:40:07.969 --> 01:40:11.038 region:rollup2
HONESTLY SKEPTICAL ABOUT

01:40:09.103 --> 01:40:12.607 region:rollup2
PORTABLE BENEFITS.

01:40:11.038 --> 01:40:14.208 region:rollup2
I'M ALSO SKEPTICAL ABOUT

01:40:12.607 --> 01:40:17.011 region:rollup2
RETRAINING. AND I LET ME TELL

01:40:14.208 --> 01:40:18.946 region:rollup2
YOU WHY.

01:40:17.011 --> 01:40:20.481 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A PLANT CLOSURE WE JUST

01:40:18.946 --> 01:40:22.283 region:rollup2
GOT NOTICE TWO THOUSAND

01:40:20.481 --> 01:40:23.684 region:rollup2
TEAMSTERS AT SENECA FOODS

01:40:22.283 --> 01:40:25.553 region:rollup2
CANNERY IN MODESTO ARE GOING TO

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:27.755 region:rollup2
LOSE THEIR JOBS.

01:40:25.553 --> 01:40:29.490 region:rollup2
THIS IS HAPPENING AS WE SPEAK.

01:40:27.755 --> 01:40:31.025 region:rollup2
AT OUR PEAK WE HAVE A HUNDRED

01:40:29.490 --> 01:40:32.627 region:rollup2
THOUSAND MEMBERS WORKING IN

01:40:31.025 --> 01:40:33.928 region:rollup2
CANNERIES MOSTLY IN THE CENTRAL

01:40:32.627 --> 01:40:35.229 region:rollup2
VALLEY.

01:40:33.928 --> 01:40:36.998 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE DOWN TO FIFTEEN

01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:39.200 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AS I SAID WE'RE GONNA

01:40:36.998 --> 01:40:40.935 region:rollup2
LOSE TWO THOUSAND MARK.

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:43.037 region:rollup2
THE LAST PLANT CLOSURE WE HAD

01:40:40.935 --> 01:40:44.872 region:rollup2
WAS HERE IN SACRAMENTO CAMPBELL

01:40:43.037 --> 01:40:46.507 region:rollup2
SOUP IN TWENTY TWELVE AND EIGHT

01:40:44.872 --> 01:40:48.709 region:rollup2
HUNDRED TEAMSTERS LOST THEIR

01:40:46.507 --> 01:40:50.411 region:rollup2
JOBS.

01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:52.813 region:rollup2
THE GREAT ARTICLE ACTUALLY

01:40:50.411 --> 01:40:54.882 region:rollup2
HORRIBLE ARTICLE IN THE SACK BE

01:40:52.813 --> 01:40:56.784 region:rollup2
THE DAN MORAINE WROTE PROFILING

01:40:54.882 --> 01:40:59.353 region:rollup2
ONE OF OUR MEMBERS WHOSE MOM HAD

01:40:56.784 --> 01:41:00.621 region:rollup2
WORKED THERE HER WHOLE LIFE SHE

01:40:59.353 --> 01:41:02.690 region:rollup2
FOLLOWED HER MOM THERE.

01:41:00.621 --> 01:41:05.726 region:rollup2
IT WAS NOT UNCOMMON. SINGLE MOM

01:41:02.690 --> 01:41:07.528 region:rollup2
WITH TWO KIDS LOST HER JOB.

01:41:05.726 --> 01:41:09.564 region:rollup2
HER UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE RAN

01:41:07.528 --> 01:41:11.532 region:rollup2
OUT SHE GOT RETRAINING.

01:41:09.564 --> 01:41:14.268 region:rollup2
THROUGH THROUGH UNDER THE WARN

01:41:11.532 --> 01:41:16.337 region:rollup2
ACT AND AND TRADE ADJUSTMENT.

01:41:14.268 --> 01:41:16.837 region:rollup2
IT TOOK HER THREE YEARS TO LEARN

01:41:16.337 --> 01:41:18.439 region:rollup2
TO BECOME AN ULTRASOUND

01:41:16.837 --> 01:41:20.541 region:rollup2
TECHNICIAN

01:41:18.439 --> 01:41:22.577 region:rollup2
BY THAT TIME. SHE HAD LOST THEIR

01:41:20.541 --> 01:41:25.379 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE GOT SICK MOVED

01:41:22.577 --> 01:41:27.715 region:rollup2
HER FAMILY BACK IN WITH HER MOM.

01:41:25.379 --> 01:41:29.417 region:rollup2
AND AT THE END OF HER RETRAINING

01:41:27.715 --> 01:41:31.385 region:rollup2
THERE WAS NO.

01:41:29.417 --> 01:41:34.455 region:rollup2
JOB GUARANTEE SHE WAS NOT

01:41:31.385 --> 01:41:35.990 region:rollup2
MATCHED TO A JOB.

01:41:34.455 --> 01:41:38.859 region:rollup2
IN THE SAME ARTICLE.

01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:40.995 region:rollup2
MISTER MORAINE TALKED ABOUT THE

01:41:38.859 --> 01:41:43.264 region:rollup2
OWNER OF THE CAMPBELL SOUP.

01:41:40.995 --> 01:41:45.166 region:rollup2
COMPANY WHO WAS A MEMBER OF THE

01:41:43.264 --> 01:41:46.767 region:rollup2
SEVENTEENTH WEALTHIEST FAMILY IN

01:41:45.166 --> 01:41:48.502 region:rollup2
THE UNITED STATES ACCORDING TO

01:41:46.767 --> 01:41:50.271 region:rollup2
FORBES WHO.

01:41:48.502 --> 01:41:52.440 region:rollup2
IN THE PANAMA PAPERS IT CAME OUT

01:41:50.271 --> 01:41:53.874 region:rollup2
HE MOVE TO IRELAND RENOUNCED HIS

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:56.877 region:rollup2
US CITIZENSHIP TO AVOID PAYING

01:41:53.874 --> 01:41:59.714 region:rollup2
TAXES.

01:41:56.877 --> 01:42:01.449 region:rollup2
SO VERY DRAMATIC EXAMPLE BUT.

01:41:59.714 --> 01:42:03.150 region:rollup2
IT REINFORCES THE POINT TO ME

01:42:01.449 --> 01:42:05.486 region:rollup2
THAT WE CANNOT TRUST THE

01:42:03.150 --> 01:42:07.221 region:rollup2
COMPANIES.

01:42:05.486 --> 01:42:08.756 region:rollup2
CORD DEVELOPING THIS TECHNOLOGY

01:42:07.221 --> 01:42:10.791 region:rollup2
TO WRITE THE RULES

01:42:08.756 --> 01:42:12.693 region:rollup2
CANNOT TRUSTS THEM TO DO THAT

01:42:10.791 --> 01:42:14.428 region:rollup2
FOR THE WORKERS AND FOR YOUR

01:42:12.693 --> 01:42:15.963 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS

01:42:14.428 --> 01:42:17.965 region:rollup2
AND. WE NEED YOU. TO WRITE THE

01:42:15.963 --> 01:42:19.867 region:rollup2
RULES.

01:42:17.965 --> 01:42:21.335 region:rollup2
THE TEAMSTERS ARE NOT AGAINST

01:42:19.867 --> 01:42:23.304 region:rollup2
INNOVATION.

01:42:21.335 --> 01:42:25.940 region:rollup2
MORE NOT GONNA STOP.

01:42:23.304 --> 01:42:27.708 region:rollup2
THE THE REVOLUTION THE ROBOT

01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:28.342 region:rollup2
APOCALYPSE WHATEVER YOU WANNA

01:42:27.708 --> 01:42:29.410 region:rollup2
CALL IT WE'RE NOT GOING TO STOP

01:42:28.342 --> 01:42:30.678 region:rollup2
IT.

01:42:29.410 --> 01:42:32.079 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GOING TO PROTECT ALL

01:42:30.678 --> 01:42:32.580 region:rollup2
THE JOBS BUT WE'RE GONNA DO OUR

01:42:32.079 --> 01:42:35.549 region:rollup2
VERY BEST TO PROTECT THE

01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:37.952 region:rollup2
WORKERS.

01:42:35.549 --> 01:42:39.520 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED YOU TO GET

01:42:37.952 --> 01:42:41.422 region:rollup2
COMMITMENTS FROM THE COMPANIES

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:43.057 region:rollup2
TO RETAIN AND RETRAIN INCUMBENT

01:42:41.422 --> 01:42:45.726 region:rollup2
WORKERS.

01:42:43.057 --> 01:42:47.862 region:rollup2
TO TO WORK WITH US AND WITH

01:42:45.726 --> 01:42:49.130 region:rollup2
EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS TO FIGURE

01:42:47.862 --> 01:42:50.531 region:rollup2
OUT WHAT THE SKILLS ARE THAT

01:42:49.130 --> 01:42:51.799 region:rollup2
PEOPLE NEED NOW HOW DO YOU MATCH

01:42:50.531 --> 01:42:52.900 region:rollup2
THEM UP.

01:42:51.799 --> 01:42:55.069 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:56.637 region:rollup2
THAT THESE ARE QUALITY JOBS

01:42:55.069 --> 01:42:58.639 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO SUPPORT

01:42:56.637 --> 01:43:00.174 region:rollup2
THEIR FAMILIES. TO ME THAT'S

01:42:58.639 --> 01:43:02.143 region:rollup2
REAL INNOVATION.

01:43:00.174 --> 01:43:03.711 region:rollup2
THAT'S TECHNOLOGY THAT'LL MAKE

01:43:02.143 --> 01:43:05.446 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S JOBS

01:43:03.711 --> 01:43:07.348 region:rollup2
SAY FOR THAT MAKE THEM MORE

01:43:05.446 --> 01:43:09.016 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVE SO THAT THEY CAN EARN

01:43:07.348 --> 01:43:10.951 region:rollup2
MORE MONEY.

01:43:09.016 --> 01:43:13.187 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD REDUCE THE GAP BETWEEN

01:43:10.951 --> 01:43:14.588 region:rollup2
THE HAVES AND THE HAVE NOTS.

01:43:13.187 --> 01:43:16.891 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THE PROBLEMS WE SHOULD

01:43:14.588 --> 01:43:18.693 region:rollup2
BE SOLVING FOR WITH TECHNOLOGY

01:43:16.891 --> 01:43:20.828 region:rollup2
INTO THAT AND I WILL CLOSE ON

01:43:18.693 --> 01:43:22.630 region:rollup2
THIS I AGREE WITH ONE OF THE

01:43:20.828 --> 01:43:23.898 region:rollup2
OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:43:22.630 --> 01:43:26.901 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD ACTUALLY BE WELL

01:43:23.898 --> 01:43:28.369 region:rollup2
SERVED BY A COMMISSION THAT THIS

01:43:26.901 --> 01:43:30.805 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

01:43:28.369 --> 01:43:32.840 region:rollup2
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TO LOOK AT

01:43:30.805 --> 01:43:34.809 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES AROUND TECHNOLOGY

01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:36.944 region:rollup2
AUTOMATION IN THE FUTURE OF WORK

01:43:34.809 --> 01:43:38.679 region:rollup2
THAT INVOLVES INDUSTRY. LABOR

01:43:36.944 --> 01:43:40.448 region:rollup2
AND WORKERS WERE LEFT OFF THAT

01:43:38.679 --> 01:43:42.016 region:rollup2
EARLIER LIST AND I THINK WE ARE

01:43:40.448 --> 01:43:43.117 region:rollup2
AN IMPORTANT VOICE.

01:43:42.016 --> 01:43:45.486 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THE

01:43:43.117 --> 01:43:47.521 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION TO

01:43:45.486 --> 01:43:48.422 region:rollup2
PUSH THIS IDEA. AND I THANK YOU

01:43:47.521 --> 01:43:50.191 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND

01:43:48.422 --> 01:43:51.158 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TO.

01:43:50.191 --> 01:43:52.693 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

01:43:51.158 --> 01:43:55.029 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION JAM AND.

01:43:52.693 --> 01:43:57.298 region:rollup2
WITHOUT DOUBT QUESTIONS OF

01:43:55.029 --> 01:43:58.232 region:rollup2
MISTER OBERNOLTE GO AHEAD.

01:43:57.298 --> 01:44:00.034 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT YOUR QUESTION FOR

01:43:58.232 --> 01:44:02.870 region:rollup2
MR MENDONCA AND.

01:44:00.034 --> 01:44:03.971 region:rollup2
I I WAS FASCINATED BY YOUR

01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:04.972 region:rollup2
COMMENTS ABOUT TECHNOLOGICAL

01:44:03.971 --> 01:44:06.207 region:rollup2
UNEMPLOYMENT AND PARTICULARLY

01:44:04.972 --> 01:44:08.843 region:rollup2
THE.

01:44:06.207 --> 01:44:10.077 region:rollup2
ASSERTION THAT WHEN WE SAY. OUR

01:44:08.843 --> 01:44:11.112 region:rollup2
UNEMPLOYMENT WE'RE REALLY

01:44:10.077 --> 01:44:11.879 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT DISPLACEMENT WE'RE

01:44:11.112 --> 01:44:13.013 region:rollup2
TALKING NOT TALK ABOUT

01:44:11.879 --> 01:44:14.882 region:rollup2
UNEMPLOYMENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:44:13.013 --> 01:44:16.851 region:rollup2
THE NEED TO RETRAIN PEOPLE INTO

01:44:14.882 --> 01:44:17.785 region:rollup2
NEW JOBS BECAUSE. THE USUALLY

01:44:16.851 --> 01:44:19.186 region:rollup2
THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY CAN

01:44:17.785 --> 01:44:20.621 region:rollup2
CATALYZE THE CREATION OF MORE

01:44:19.186 --> 01:44:22.456 region:rollup2
NEW JOBS OF THE JOBS IT

01:44:20.621 --> 01:44:24.091 region:rollup2
DISPLACES BUT IT CREATE CREASES

01:44:22.456 --> 01:44:25.559 region:rollup2
BIG SOCIETAL PROBLEM. A LOT OF

01:44:24.091 --> 01:44:26.994 region:rollup2
THE OTHER PANELISTS AT SIMILAR

01:44:25.559 --> 01:44:28.496 region:rollup2
THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THAT BUT I

01:44:26.994 --> 01:44:29.930 region:rollup2
WONDER FOR BEING A LITTLE BIT

01:44:28.496 --> 01:44:31.499 region:rollup2
NAIVE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:31.999 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING

01:44:31.499 --> 01:44:33.634 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT

01:44:31.999 --> 01:44:35.136 region:rollup2
LOGICALLY. THEY WERE TALKING

01:44:33.634 --> 01:44:36.704 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW TO RETRAIN PEOPLE AND

01:44:35.136 --> 01:44:38.272 region:rollup2
AND HOW TO GET THEM TO

01:44:36.704 --> 01:44:39.406 region:rollup2
TRANSITION INTO FROM AS YOUR

01:44:38.272 --> 01:44:41.375 region:rollup2
LOCAL JOBS INTO THE NEW FIELDS.

01:44:39.406 --> 01:44:42.576 region:rollup2
YEAH BUT IF YOU LOOK BACK AT

01:44:41.375 --> 01:44:44.478 region:rollup2
HISTORY OF. WHAT WE'VE GONE

01:44:42.576 --> 01:44:46.213 region:rollup2
THROUGH THESE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:44:44.478 --> 01:44:47.848 region:rollup2
BEFORE I MEAN IN THE WHAT THE

01:44:46.213 --> 01:44:49.383 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN ELEVEN? WHEN WE HAD THE

01:44:47.848 --> 01:44:51.619 region:rollup2
LUDDITES BURNING THE TEXTILE

01:44:49.383 --> 01:44:52.620 region:rollup2
MILLS IN ENGLAND.

01:44:51.619 --> 01:44:53.554 region:rollup2
.

01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:55.456 region:rollup2
IT IT THAT WAS REALLY WHAT

01:44:53.554 --> 01:44:57.658 region:rollup2
CATALYZED THE BIGGEST EXPANSION

01:44:55.456 --> 01:44:59.293 region:rollup2
IN OUR QUALITY OF LIFE IN HUMAN

01:44:57.658 --> 01:45:00.594 region:rollup2
HISTORY UP UNTIL THAT POINT. AND

01:44:59.293 --> 01:45:02.596 region:rollup2
YET I DON'T THINK THAT IF WE

01:45:00.594 --> 01:45:04.198 region:rollup2
WENT DOWN TO THE TO THAT MOB

01:45:02.596 --> 01:45:05.266 region:rollup2
WITH THE TORCHES AND SAID HEY

01:45:04.198 --> 01:45:07.067 region:rollup2
WAIT WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU NEW

01:45:05.266 --> 01:45:07.701 region:rollup2
JOBS YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND I

01:45:07.067 --> 01:45:09.103 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THAT WOULD DO ANY

01:45:07.701 --> 01:45:10.838 region:rollup2
GOOD SO. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE

01:45:09.103 --> 01:45:11.639 region:rollup2
ROBOT APOCALYPSE ALMOST LOOK AT

01:45:10.838 --> 01:45:13.073 region:rollup2
IT FROM AN OPPOSITE POINT OF

01:45:11.639 --> 01:45:15.342 region:rollup2
VIEW AND IT'S NOT LIKE WE FEAR

01:45:13.073 --> 01:45:17.678 region:rollup2
THE ROBOTS WE FEAR OUR REACTION

01:45:15.342 --> 01:45:19.480 region:rollup2
TO. THIS TECHNOLOGY AND I WONDER

01:45:17.678 --> 01:45:20.714 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CAN DO TO TO EDUCATE

01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:21.515 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ABOUT THIS COMING

01:45:20.714 --> 01:45:23.150 region:rollup2
TRANSITION BECAUSE TO ME THAT'S

01:45:21.515 --> 01:45:24.718 region:rollup2
KEY TO AVOIDING THE THE

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:27.021 region:rollup2
APOCALYPTIC PART OF WHAT YOU'RE

01:45:24.718 --> 01:45:30.057 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT.

01:45:27.021 --> 01:45:31.325 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:45:30.057 --> 01:45:32.793 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF TIMES

01:45:31.325 --> 01:45:34.428 region:rollup2
IN RECENT HISTORY WHERE WE HAD

01:45:32.793 --> 01:45:34.862 region:rollup2
THE SCALE OF CHANGE.

01:45:34.428 --> 01:45:37.398 region:rollup2
A MOVEMENT FROM THE

01:45:34.862 --> 01:45:39.500 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURAL.

01:45:37.398 --> 01:45:40.434 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT TO.

01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:42.670 region:rollup2
THAT MANUFACTURING EMPLOYMENT

01:45:40.434 --> 01:45:45.406 region:rollup2
FOR MANUFACTURING TO TO.

01:45:42.670 --> 01:45:46.473 region:rollup2
SERVICE WERE ENTERING THE THIRD

01:45:45.406 --> 01:45:48.075 region:rollup2
YEAR OF THAT A TRANSITION TO A

01:45:46.473 --> 01:45:50.311 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY BASED

01:45:48.075 --> 01:45:51.278 region:rollup2
ERA IN EACH OF THOSE PRIOR IS

01:45:50.311 --> 01:45:52.913 region:rollup2
THAT WAS PUSHED BACK FOR THE

01:45:51.278 --> 01:45:54.682 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY.

01:45:52.913 --> 01:45:56.250 region:rollup2
BUT THERE WAS ALSO A MASSIVE

01:45:54.682 --> 01:45:58.052 region:rollup2
INNOVATION AND HOW WE ENABLED

01:45:56.250 --> 01:45:59.787 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THEM SO

01:45:58.052 --> 01:46:01.922 region:rollup2
IN THE FIRST ONE WE INVENTED IN

01:45:59.787 --> 01:46:02.990 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL HIGH SCHOOL.

01:46:01.922 --> 01:46:05.459 region:rollup2
THE SECOND ONE WE MOVED PRETTY

01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:06.961 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY THE GI BILL AND TO

01:46:05.459 --> 01:46:08.662 region:rollup2
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THINGS LIKE

01:46:06.961 --> 01:46:10.231 region:rollup2
THE MASTER PLAN TO CALIFORNIA.

01:46:08.662 --> 01:46:12.233 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAD THE

01:46:10.231 --> 01:46:13.234 region:rollup2
SIDE OF OPPORTUNITIES TO BE ABLE

01:46:12.233 --> 01:46:15.035 region:rollup2
TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT NEXT

01:46:13.234 --> 01:46:16.570 region:rollup2
MONTH WE'RE GONNA NEED THAT SAME

01:46:15.035 --> 01:46:18.873 region:rollup2
SCALE OF THINKING HERE.

01:46:16.570 --> 01:46:19.907 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S IT IS THERE IT

01:46:18.873 --> 01:46:21.075 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE

01:46:19.907 --> 01:46:22.443 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT THESE

01:46:21.075 --> 01:46:25.012 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES I AGREE WITH THAT

01:46:22.443 --> 01:46:27.081 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT. HOW OUR

01:46:25.012 --> 01:46:28.349 region:rollup2
PACE AND SCALE OF ENSURING THAT?

01:46:27.081 --> 01:46:29.917 region:rollup2
THE WORK FORCE IS ABLE TO

01:46:28.349 --> 01:46:32.219 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN THESE GAINES

01:46:29.917 --> 01:46:34.154 region:rollup2
MATCHES THE PACE OF CHANGE OF OF

01:46:32.219 --> 01:46:36.090 region:rollup2
THE TECHNOLOGY AND SO THAT'S

01:46:34.154 --> 01:46:37.258 region:rollup2
WHERE I'M BY I THINK THAT

01:46:36.090 --> 01:46:39.059 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION REALLY NEEDS TO BE

01:46:37.258 --> 01:46:40.294 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT PART OF IT HOW DO WE

01:46:39.059 --> 01:46:42.763 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS AN

01:46:40.294 --> 01:46:43.697 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE. I DO

01:46:42.763 --> 01:46:45.666 region:rollup2
THINK THERE WILL BE NEW JOBS

01:46:43.697 --> 01:46:47.201 region:rollup2
THERE AND I SHARE THE VIEW THAT

01:46:45.666 --> 01:46:49.970 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES WILL

01:46:47.201 --> 01:46:50.905 region:rollup2
CREATE DIFFERENT KINDS OF JOBS.

01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:52.606 region:rollup2
SO THERE MAY BE MORE JOBS AND

01:46:50.905 --> 01:46:53.641 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION IS THE RESULT OF

01:46:52.606 --> 01:46:55.175 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE CHANGES THEY'LL BE

01:46:53.641 --> 01:46:56.210 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENT JOBS.

01:46:55.175 --> 01:46:57.111 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:46:56.210 --> 01:46:58.679 region:rollup2
EVERYONE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY

01:46:57.111 --> 01:47:00.014 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATED NOTS.

01:46:58.679 --> 01:47:01.715 region:rollup2
THANKS I AGREE WITH YOU I JUST

01:47:00.014 --> 01:47:04.318 region:rollup2
WONDER IF THAT BATTLE STARTS

01:47:01.715 --> 01:47:05.552 region:rollup2
DOESN'T START NOW NOT WIN THE

01:47:04.318 --> 01:47:06.453 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S PEOPLE DISPLACED BUT

01:47:05.552 --> 01:47:08.222 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT BATTLE STARTING

01:47:06.453 --> 01:47:09.823 region:rollup2
NOW WITH AN EDUCATIONAL PROCESS

01:47:08.222 --> 01:47:11.158 region:rollup2
THAT SAYING LOOK THIS CHANGES

01:47:09.823 --> 01:47:12.192 region:rollup2
COMING. WE NEED TO BE PREPARED

01:47:11.158 --> 01:47:14.194 region:rollup2
FOR IT COMPLETELY GREAT. THANK

01:47:12.192 --> 01:47:17.031 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:47:14.194 --> 01:47:18.699 region:rollup2
BOB THANK YOU ARE ON THE ISSUE

01:47:17.031 --> 01:47:19.767 region:rollup2
OF EDUCATION I THINK.

01:47:18.699 --> 01:47:21.802 region:rollup2
ON COMPUTER SCIENCE

01:47:19.767 --> 01:47:22.503 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY I THINK THE EXAMPLE

01:47:21.802 --> 01:47:25.005 region:rollup2
WAS THAT WAS GIVEN WAS.

01:47:22.503 --> 01:47:26.407 region:rollup2
POTTERY VOICES COMPUTER SCIENCE

01:47:25.005 --> 01:47:27.007 region:rollup2
SO IT'S A QUESTION AYE I THINK

01:47:26.407 --> 01:47:28.609 region:rollup2
WAS EITHER AT MISTER ATKINSON

01:47:27.007 --> 01:47:31.378 region:rollup2
OR.

01:47:28.609 --> 01:47:33.514 region:rollup2
LENNY UP BUT THE QUESTION IS

01:47:31.378 --> 01:47:35.416 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE MOTIVATE YOUNG YOUNG

01:47:33.514 --> 01:47:37.351 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TOO. ARE MAKING MANY

01:47:35.416 --> 01:47:39.019 region:rollup2
STANDARD COMPUTER SCIENCES YOU

01:47:37.351 --> 01:47:39.620 region:rollup2
KNOW THE ESSENCE OR THAT DENTAL

01:47:39.019 --> 01:47:41.655 region:rollup2
THAT'S GONNA BE THE BUILDING

01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:43.857 region:rollup2
BLOCK FOR THE FUTURE JOBS AND

01:47:41.655 --> 01:47:45.793 region:rollup2
AND ALL. ON SUSU YOU KNOW WE WE

01:47:43.857 --> 01:47:48.028 region:rollup2
DO WANT TO INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO

01:47:45.793 --> 01:47:48.662 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW GET INTO COMPUTER

01:47:48.028 --> 01:47:49.129 region:rollup2
SCIENCE BUT BUT WHAT IS WHAT IS

01:47:48.662 --> 01:47:49.863 region:rollup2
THE.

01:47:49.129 --> 01:47:52.666 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO

01:47:49.863 --> 01:47:55.736 region:rollup2
MOTIVATE YOUNG PEOPLE?

01:47:52.666 --> 01:47:57.137 region:rollup2
ARE YOU THERE. WELFARE.

01:47:55.736 --> 01:47:59.073 region:rollup2
YEAH I I I DIVERT ALL.

01:47:57.137 --> 01:48:00.607 region:rollup2
THE REASON WHY POTTERY IS SO

01:47:59.073 --> 01:48:02.509 region:rollup2
POPULAR IN CALIFORNIA HIGH

01:48:00.607 --> 01:48:05.012 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DID THE REQUIREMENTS.

01:48:02.509 --> 01:48:05.546 region:rollup2
PARTS PARTS IS A REQUIREMENT

01:48:05.012 --> 01:48:07.281 region:rollup2
COMPUTER SCIENCE IS NOT A

01:48:05.546 --> 01:48:08.849 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT.

01:48:07.281 --> 01:48:10.484 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY IT ALL

01:48:08.849 --> 01:48:12.152 region:rollup2
THAT MUCH OF A QUESTION THE

01:48:10.484 --> 01:48:13.354 region:rollup2
MOTIVATION I I THINK THERE. LOTS

01:48:12.152 --> 01:48:15.589 region:rollup2
AND LOTS OF KIDS WHO ARE

01:48:13.354 --> 01:48:17.091 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN ENGAGING IN

01:48:15.589 --> 01:48:20.160 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY YOU LOOK AT IT AND

01:48:17.091 --> 01:48:21.362 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT ADDITION LIKE FIRST

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:22.229 region:rollup2
ROBOTICS. ABACHA.

01:48:21.362 --> 01:48:23.330 region:rollup2
A FANTASTIC PROGRAM I I'M SURE

01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:24.465 region:rollup2
EVERY.

01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:25.599 region:rollup2
SCHOOL ARE I'M SURE THERE IS A

01:48:24.465 --> 01:48:26.533 region:rollup2
SCHOOL IN EACH ONE OF YOUR

01:48:25.599 --> 01:48:28.836 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS WHERE YOU HAVE FOR

01:48:26.533 --> 01:48:29.570 region:rollup2
ROBOTICS COMPETITION GOING ON A.

01:48:28.836 --> 01:48:31.305 region:rollup2
JOIN IN.

01:48:29.570 --> 01:48:32.706 region:rollup2
REGION ALL THE NATIONAL

01:48:31.305 --> 01:48:34.508 region:rollup2
COMPETITIONS AND EVEN HER

01:48:32.706 --> 01:48:37.845 region:rollup2
NATIONAL THAT YOU CAN BUILD THE

01:48:34.508 --> 01:48:38.712 region:rollup2
BEST ROBOTICS IT WOULDN'T WHEN

01:48:37.845 --> 01:48:39.780 region:rollup2
YOU'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

01:48:38.712 --> 01:48:41.348 region:rollup2
IF YOU MEAN IF I THINK IF YOU

01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:43.584 region:rollup2
RESTRUCTURECURRICULUM AND TO

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:44.551 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT EVERY KID YEAH IN

01:48:43.584 --> 01:48:46.754 region:rollup2
EVERY HIGH SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA

01:48:44.551 --> 01:48:48.489 region:rollup2
HAS. HIGH QUALITY COMPUTER SCI

01:48:46.754 --> 01:48:49.690 region:rollup2
FI THING AND CLASSES WHICH IS

01:48:48.489 --> 01:48:51.592 region:rollup2
NOT THE CASE RIGHT NOW BEEN IN

01:48:49.690 --> 01:48:53.594 region:rollup2
EVERY COUNTRY IN EVERY STATE IN

01:48:51.592 --> 01:48:54.862 region:rollup2
THE UNION. AND SECONDLY TO REACH

01:48:53.594 --> 01:48:56.363 region:rollup2
RESTRUCTURE CURRICULUM SO THAT

01:48:54.862 --> 01:48:57.798 region:rollup2
YOU CAN HAVE PROJECT BASED

01:48:56.363 --> 01:48:59.099 region:rollup2
LEARNING AROUND THESE THINGS.

01:48:57.798 --> 01:49:01.869 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOOK AT SOMEBODY'S

01:48:59.099 --> 01:49:02.469 region:rollup2
WRITING BASED LEARNING THINGS

01:49:01.869 --> 01:49:04.638 region:rollup2
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE OUT.

01:49:02.469 --> 01:49:05.606 region:rollup2
THE MAKER MOVED ANOTHER WOULD

01:49:04.638 --> 01:49:07.241 region:rollup2
HAVE A CERTAIN SORT OF IF YOU

01:49:05.606 --> 01:49:08.575 region:rollup2
WILL TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SHOP

01:49:07.241 --> 01:49:09.810 region:rollup2
CLASS IN WHAT WAY TO THINK ABOUT

01:49:08.575 --> 01:49:10.911 region:rollup2
IT. IT ALL THE DEFENSE

01:49:09.810 --> 01:49:12.312 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT IS PILOTING WITHOUT

01:49:10.911 --> 01:49:13.847 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOLS AROUND THE COUNTRY

01:49:12.312 --> 01:49:15.249 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT IN THE ENGAGEMENT

01:49:13.847 --> 01:49:17.584 region:rollup2
WITH HIS IS JUST ENORMOUS THEY

01:49:15.249 --> 01:49:21.522 region:rollup2
COULD ACTUALLY. USE COMPUTERS.

01:49:17.584 --> 01:49:23.123 region:rollup2
DESIGN THINGS THEY USE COMPUTER

01:49:21.522 --> 01:49:24.258 region:rollup2
A SPECIES THAT BUILD THINGS.

01:49:23.123 --> 01:49:25.592 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SURE QUESTION MOTIVATION

01:49:24.258 --> 01:49:26.960 region:rollup2
I THINK IT IN SOME WAY TO THE

01:49:25.592 --> 01:49:27.694 region:rollup2
QUESTION OF IF YOU.

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:34.301 region:rollup2
LEAVE THE HORSE TO WATER HERE

01:49:27.694 --> 01:49:35.636 region:rollup2
THEY WILL BRING.

01:49:34.301 --> 01:49:37.304 region:rollup2
S. FARMING I HAD YEAH JUST ONE.

01:49:35.636 --> 01:49:38.672 region:rollup2
MAKE IT QUICK OF WHAT COMMENTS

01:49:37.304 --> 01:49:40.140 region:rollup2
APOLOGIES FOR MISSING MOST OF

01:49:38.672 --> 01:49:42.042 region:rollup2
THE THE COMMENTS ADDED TEN

01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:42.276 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENT GROUPS BACK MY

01:49:42.042 --> 01:49:43.343 region:rollup2
OFFICE.

01:49:42.276 --> 01:49:44.778 region:rollup2
BUT I'D.

01:49:43.343 --> 01:49:46.046 region:rollup2
PIGGY BACKING OFF OF.

01:49:44.778 --> 01:49:47.214 region:rollup2
MISTER ATKINSON'S COMMENTS.

01:49:46.046 --> 01:49:48.582 region:rollup2
.

01:49:47.214 --> 01:49:49.917 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT STATISTICS IN TWO

01:49:48.582 --> 01:49:51.351 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FOURTEEN TODAY'S THE MY

01:49:49.917 --> 01:49:52.719 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN A LOT AND I HAVEN'T

01:49:51.351 --> 01:49:54.088 region:rollup2
CHECKED THE UPDATED ONES BUT IN

01:49:52.719 --> 01:49:55.355 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ONLY FORTY

01:49:54.088 --> 01:49:57.057 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT OF HIGH SCHOOL

01:49:55.355 --> 01:49:58.492 region:rollup2
STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. HAD

01:49:57.057 --> 01:50:00.627 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE.

01:49:58.492 --> 01:50:02.196 region:rollup2
IT WAS TYPICALLY THE HEAVILY.

01:50:00.627 --> 01:50:03.263 region:rollup2
LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:50:02.196 --> 01:50:05.165 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WHERE THE SCHOOLS

01:50:03.263 --> 01:50:06.433 region:rollup2
DIDN'T OFFER COMPUTER SCIENCE

01:50:05.165 --> 01:50:07.968 region:rollup2
AND SO WE NEED TO INCREASE OUR

01:50:06.433 --> 01:50:09.937 region:rollup2
W. TO BRIDGE THAT.

01:50:07.968 --> 01:50:10.671 region:rollup2
KIND DIGITAL LEARNING DIVIDE

01:50:09.937 --> 01:50:12.239 region:rollup2
THAT EXISTS.

01:50:10.671 --> 01:50:14.741 region:rollup2
IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:50:12.239 --> 01:50:15.242 region:rollup2
AND MISTER ATKINSON MENTION

01:50:14.741 --> 01:50:16.076 region:rollup2
MAKING IT A REQUIREMENT.

01:50:15.242 --> 01:50:17.244 region:rollup2
.

01:50:16.076 --> 01:50:18.679 region:rollup2
I I THINK HE MEANS PART OF A

01:50:17.244 --> 01:50:20.747 region:rollup2
THROUGH G. CURRICULUM.

01:50:18.679 --> 01:50:21.748 region:rollup2
WHICH ARE THE OFF THE WALL IT

01:50:20.747 --> 01:50:22.816 region:rollup2
CAN BE GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS

01:50:21.748 --> 01:50:24.251 region:rollup2
OR COULD BE THE IF YOU'RE G.

01:50:22.816 --> 01:50:26.453 region:rollup2
CURRICULUM WHICH OF THE.

01:50:24.251 --> 01:50:27.921 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS TO QUALIFY FOR THE

01:50:26.453 --> 01:50:30.057 region:rollup2
USE YOUR SEATS YOU SYSTEMS. NON

01:50:27.921 --> 01:50:31.258 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S CURRENTLY I KNOW A

01:50:30.057 --> 01:50:33.393 region:rollup2
STATE COMPUTER SCIENCE

01:50:31.258 --> 01:50:33.927 region:rollup2
CURRICULUM COMMITTEE AND I'M

01:50:33.393 --> 01:50:34.595 region:rollup2
SURE I DIDN'T GET THE NAME

01:50:33.927 --> 01:50:36.730 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:50:34.595 --> 01:50:38.132 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S LOOKING AT IDEAS FOR

01:50:36.730 --> 01:50:40.000 region:rollup2
HOW WE CAN BETTER.

01:50:38.132 --> 01:50:42.269 region:rollup2
YEAH IMPLEMENT COMPUTER SCIENCE

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.870 region:rollup2
INTO OUR CLASSROOMS HOPEFULLY K.

01:50:42.269 --> 01:50:45.772 region:rollup2
THROUGH TWELVE ON YOU KNOW YOU

01:50:42.870 --> 01:50:47.341 region:rollup2
HEAVY COATING IN

01:50:45.772 --> 01:50:48.475 region:rollup2
SECOND GRADE BUT YOU CAN. BE

01:50:47.341 --> 01:50:49.676 region:rollup2
CERTAIN I LEARNED SOME OF THE

01:50:48.475 --> 01:50:51.145 region:rollup2
CONCEPTS AND SO.

01:50:49.676 --> 01:50:51.745 region:rollup2
I'M LOOKING FOR TO SEE WHAT THE

01:56:21.208 --> 01:56:24.311 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY UNFORTUNATELY NONE OF

01:56:22.576 --> 01:56:26.379 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA TEAMS.

01:56:24.311 --> 01:56:28.048 region:rollup2
ONE IT WAS CARNEGIE MELLON. BUT.

01:56:26.379 --> 01:56:29.583 region:rollup2
IT PROVED A POINT THAT.

01:56:28.048 --> 01:56:32.018 region:rollup2
.

01:56:29.583 --> 01:56:33.119 region:rollup2
YOUR AYE POWERED CYBERSECURITY.

01:56:32.018 --> 01:56:35.088 region:rollup2
ON BOTH ON THE OFFENSE AND

01:56:33.119 --> 01:56:37.624 region:rollup2
DEFENSE ASSISTANT DEFENSE OF

01:56:35.088 --> 01:56:40.227 region:rollup2
SIDE. IS HERE AYE IT IS IS NOT

01:56:37.624 --> 01:56:41.261 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT HAS A A FANTASY.

01:56:40.227 --> 01:56:42.095 region:rollup2
AND I THINK.

01:56:41.261 --> 01:56:43.997 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE THAT ARE IN THE

01:56:42.095 --> 01:56:44.531 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE.

01:56:43.997 --> 01:56:46.700 region:rollup2
FROM A.

01:56:44.531 --> 01:56:48.502 region:rollup2
UNPACKING WHAT THE STORY.

01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:50.103 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEFENSIVE

01:56:48.502 --> 01:56:52.038 region:rollup2
SIDE. THERE ARE.

01:56:50.103 --> 01:56:53.707 region:rollup2
YOU NAME THE NUMBER OF

01:56:52.038 --> 01:56:55.375 region:rollup2
COMPANIES OUT THERE DOZENS AND

01:56:53.707 --> 01:56:56.843 region:rollup2
DOZENS THAT TALENT.

01:56:55.375 --> 01:56:58.044 region:rollup2
A AYE CAPABILITIES.

01:56:56.843 --> 01:56:58.845 region:rollup2
IMUS IS IMPORTANT.

01:56:58.044 --> 01:57:00.480 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:56:58.845 --> 01:57:01.948 region:rollup2
DEFENDING NETWORKS IS A VERY

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:04.451 region:rollup2
COMPLEX VERY DIFFICULT THERE'S A

01:57:01.948 --> 01:57:06.186 region:rollup2
LOT OF DATA TO CHEW THROUGH. A

01:57:04.451 --> 01:57:08.154 region:rollup2
TO TRY IDENTIFY MALICIOUS AND

01:57:06.186 --> 01:57:09.623 region:rollup2
SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY A AYE IS A

01:57:08.154 --> 01:57:11.358 region:rollup2
HUGE HELP IN THAT.

01:57:09.623 --> 01:57:12.759 region:rollup2
I WAS ABLE TO FIND THOSE NEEDLES

01:57:11.358 --> 01:57:14.027 region:rollup2
IN THE HAYSTACK AND AUTOMATE

01:57:12.759 --> 01:57:16.730 region:rollup2
MANY CASES.

01:57:14.027 --> 01:57:17.163 region:rollup2
INITIAL SCRIPTED RESPONSES TO

01:57:16.730 --> 01:57:18.198 region:rollup2
UPLOAD HOLES IN THE

01:57:17.163 --> 01:57:21.234 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:57:18.198 --> 01:57:22.502 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY UTILIZE SIM A I AM

01:57:21.234 --> 01:57:24.137 region:rollup2
THE STATE ALREADY.

01:57:22.502 --> 01:57:25.939 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE.

01:57:24.137 --> 01:57:27.040 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS THAT WE

01:57:25.939 --> 01:57:28.875 region:rollup2
BUILT WITHIN OUR SECURITY

01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:30.844 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS CENTER RECEIVED A.

01:57:28.875 --> 01:57:32.812 region:rollup2
USES MACHINE LEARNING.

01:57:30.844 --> 01:57:33.380 region:rollup2
p AND THAT HELPS OUR ANALYST AT

01:57:32.812 --> 01:57:34.381 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY'RE

01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:36.182 region:rollup2
WRITTEN THEY DO.

01:57:34.381 --> 01:57:37.784 region:rollup2
IT IS A.

01:57:36.182 --> 01:57:39.252 region:rollup2
CONTINUALLY EVOLVING.

01:57:37.784 --> 01:57:40.787 region:rollup2
SKILL SET OUT IS SOMETHING HAS

01:57:39.252 --> 01:57:41.588 region:rollup2
TO BE TUNED.

01:57:40.787 --> 01:57:44.190 region:rollup2
COSTLY MONITORED.

01:57:41.588 --> 01:57:46.826 region:rollup2
BUT IT DEFTLY HAS HELPED.

01:57:44.190 --> 01:57:48.828 region:rollup2
NOW THAT'S THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS.

01:57:46.826 --> 01:57:51.464 region:rollup2
ON COULD THE BAD NEWS FRONT.

01:57:48.828 --> 01:57:52.098 region:rollup2
JUST AS YOU HAVE A AYE DEFENSES

01:57:51.464 --> 01:57:53.934 region:rollup2
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A AYE OFFENSE

01:57:52.098 --> 01:57:56.570 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

01:57:53.934 --> 01:57:57.837 region:rollup2
IS YOU KNOW CURRENTLY THERE ARE

01:57:56.570 --> 01:58:00.073 region:rollup2
A LOT OF.

01:57:57.837 --> 01:58:01.875 region:rollup2
SCRIPTING ENGINES OUT THERE

01:58:00.073 --> 01:58:02.475 region:rollup2
THAT YOU DO AUTOMATIC ATTACKS

01:58:01.875 --> 01:58:03.510 region:rollup2
WOULD BLOCK ALLOTMENT BICU HAS

01:58:02.475 --> 01:58:06.179 region:rollup2
ALREADY.

01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:06.546 region:rollup2
THEY'RE JUST HUNTING FOR A

01:58:06.179 --> 01:58:07.981 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY KNOWN

01:58:06.546 --> 01:58:09.082 region:rollup2
VULNERABILITIES.

01:58:07.981 --> 01:58:10.650 region:rollup2
AND WANTS TO GET A FOOTHOLD THAT

01:58:09.082 --> 01:58:12.419 region:rollup2
CAN ACTUALLY LAUNCH A PLUMERI.

01:58:10.650 --> 01:58:14.387 region:rollup2
TAX.

01:58:12.419 --> 01:58:15.388 region:rollup2
TO ESTABLISH A FOOTHOLD AND

01:58:14.387 --> 01:58:17.090 region:rollup2
THEN ALLOW HUMAN IN LIEU.

01:58:15.388 --> 01:58:18.758 region:rollup2
.

01:58:17.090 --> 01:58:20.727 region:rollup2
THAT WILL GET BETTER OVER TIME.

01:58:18.758 --> 01:58:22.729 region:rollup2
ATTACKERS WILL BECOME A JUSTICE

01:58:20.727 --> 01:58:24.230 region:rollup2
DEFENDERS ARE MORE MORE RELIANT

01:58:22.729 --> 01:58:25.966 region:rollup2
ON A AYE WHICH MEANS THAT.

01:58:24.230 --> 01:58:27.834 region:rollup2
SADLY YOU'RE GONNA LOOK AT

01:58:25.966 --> 01:58:29.602 region:rollup2
FASTER CHEAPER.

01:58:27.834 --> 01:58:31.771 region:rollup2
AND MORE TAILORED TO TAX.

01:58:29.602 --> 01:58:32.372 region:rollup2
ALSO OF MORE HARDER TO

01:58:31.771 --> 01:58:33.406 region:rollup2
ATTRIBUTE.

01:58:32.372 --> 01:58:35.041 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN

01:58:33.406 --> 01:58:36.142 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY UTILIZE FOR ATTRIBUTION

01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:37.377 region:rollup2
TODAY CURRENTLY. WITH CYBER

01:58:36.142 --> 01:58:39.746 region:rollup2
ATTACKS

01:58:37.377 --> 01:58:41.247 region:rollup2
IS OUR THE FLAWS THAT YOU WOULD

01:58:39.746 --> 01:58:43.049 region:rollup2
SEE FROM HUMAN ERROR IN CODING

01:58:41.247 --> 01:58:44.718 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:58:43.049 --> 01:58:46.519 region:rollup2
FOLKS THAT DEVELOPMENT WHERE A

01:58:44.718 --> 01:58:47.120 region:rollup2
LOT TIMES THEY'VE WE'VE LITTLE

01:58:46.519 --> 01:58:47.754 region:rollup2
CLONE CARDS THAT EVEN KNOWING

02:01:30.717 --> 02:01:34.420 region:rollup2
AT THEN PAIRS THAT MERGE INTO A

02:01:32.519 --> 02:01:35.789 region:rollup2
LOCAL CAREER WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVE

02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:37.791 region:rollup2
NETWORK OF ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY

02:01:35.789 --> 02:01:40.560 region:rollup2
THOUSAND CAREERS IN ANY GIVEN

02:01:37.791 --> 02:01:41.761 region:rollup2
MOMENT ON THE PLATFORM I'M AND

02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:44.531 region:rollup2
THEN DROPPED THAT OFF AT YOUR

02:01:41.761 --> 02:01:46.432 region:rollup2
HOME. SO FOR US ARE TESTING OF A

02:01:44.531 --> 02:01:49.002 region:rollup2
I ACTUALLY COMES IN THE FORM OF

02:01:46.432 --> 02:01:50.570 region:rollup2
ROBOTICS AND IT STARTS FROM ITS

02:01:49.002 --> 02:01:53.273 region:rollup2
BASE OF UNDERSTANDING AND

02:01:50.570 --> 02:01:55.742 region:rollup2
REALIZING THAT THE WAY COMMERCE

02:01:53.273 --> 02:01:57.944 region:rollup2
IS SHIFTING. IN CITIES IS

02:01:55.742 --> 02:02:01.181 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY TRANSFORMING OVERNIGHT

02:01:57.944 --> 02:02:04.250 region:rollup2
AMER ALL FAMILIAR WITH AN AMAZON

02:02:01.181 --> 02:02:07.554 region:rollup2
LIKE PLATFORMER WALMART DOT COM

02:02:04.250 --> 02:02:09.589 region:rollup2
LIKE PLATFORM. PAPER CONVENIENT

02:02:07.554 --> 02:02:12.892 region:rollup2
HYPER USEFUL BUT THEIR APPROACH

02:02:09.589 --> 02:02:14.661 region:rollup2
IS ACTUALLY BUILDING A WAREHOUSE

02:02:12.892 --> 02:02:17.497 region:rollup2
ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF CITIES AND

02:02:14.661 --> 02:02:17.864 region:rollup2
AND FUNNELING THOSE GOODS INTO

02:02:17.497 --> 02:02:18.498 region:rollup2
TOWN.

02:02:17.864 --> 02:02:19.065 region:rollup2
A COMPANY LIKE POST MATES IN

02:02:18.498 --> 02:02:20.133 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CALL THE ON DEMAND

02:02:19.065 --> 02:02:20.767 region:rollup2
SECTOR ACTUALLY APPROACHES IT IN

02:02:20.133 --> 02:02:21.334 region:rollup2
THE INVERSE MODEL WE ACTUALLY

02:02:20.767 --> 02:02:21.868 region:rollup2
TREAT THE ENTIRE CITY AS A

02:02:21.334 --> 02:02:22.502 region:rollup2
WAREHOUSE.

02:02:21.868 --> 02:02:23.369 region:rollup2
WE INDEXED THE PRODUCT OFFERINGS

02:02:22.502 --> 02:02:25.171 region:rollup2
OF LOCAL HARDWARE STORES MOM AND

02:02:23.369 --> 02:02:25.805 region:rollup2
POP RETAILERS BRIGHAM MODE MODEM

02:02:25.171 --> 02:02:26.406 region:rollup2
A PSYCHIATRIC MORTAR MERCHANTS

02:02:25.805 --> 02:02:27.473 region:rollup2
AND THEN GIVE THEM THE TOOLS

02:02:26.406 --> 02:02:28.041 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO DISTRIBUTE THEIR

02:02:27.473 --> 02:02:30.143 region:rollup2
GOODS.

02:02:28.041 --> 02:02:31.744 region:rollup2
SO MY NUMBERS WITHIN THE UNITED

02:02:30.143 --> 02:02:33.279 region:rollup2
STATES WE OPERATE ABOUT TWO

02:02:31.744 --> 02:02:35.281 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY U. S. CITIES WE

02:02:33.279 --> 02:02:36.816 region:rollup2
TRANSACT ABOUT THREE MILLION

02:02:35.281 --> 02:02:37.717 region:rollup2
DELIVERIES PER MONTH ON THE

02:02:36.816 --> 02:02:40.486 region:rollup2
PLATFORM.

02:02:37.717 --> 02:02:41.955 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR ALONE WE SOLD ABOUT

02:02:40.486 --> 02:02:43.890 region:rollup2
ONE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF

02:02:41.955 --> 02:02:45.191 region:rollup2
GOODS ON THE PLATFORM AND INTHE

02:02:43.890 --> 02:02:46.860 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA PER AND

02:02:45.191 --> 02:02:47.760 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC IMPACT REPORT WERE

02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:49.062 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GOING TO RELEASE AT THE

02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:50.763 region:rollup2
END OF THIS MONTH. WE'VE

02:02:49.062 --> 02:02:52.532 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SEEN THAT LOCAL

02:02:50.763 --> 02:02:54.133 region:rollup2
RETAILERS HAVE SEEN A GROWTH BY

02:02:52.532 --> 02:02:56.336 region:rollup2
ABOUT THREE POINT SEVEN OR FOUR

02:02:54.133 --> 02:02:58.004 region:rollup2
TIMES AND THE CONCEPT FOR THIS

02:02:56.336 --> 02:02:59.539 region:rollup2
IS QUITE SIMPLE AND THAT'S

02:02:58.004 --> 02:03:00.506 region:rollup2
BECAUSE NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN.

02:02:59.539 --> 02:03:02.342 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF YOU GETTING YOUR

02:03:00.506 --> 02:03:03.977 region:rollup2
LIGHT BULBS FROM AMAZON DOT COM

02:03:02.342 --> 02:03:06.112 region:rollup2
YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET THEM FROM A

02:03:03.977 --> 02:03:08.147 region:rollup2
LOCAL HARDWARE STORE NOW ALL OF

02:03:06.112 --> 02:03:10.250 region:rollup2
A SUDDEN A MOM AND POP BAKERY OR

02:03:08.147 --> 02:03:12.218 region:rollup2
TALK AREA OWNER OR FOUGHT SHOP

02:03:10.250 --> 02:03:13.953 region:rollup2
OWNER IS ABLE TO. TRANSPORT

02:03:12.218 --> 02:03:15.622 region:rollup2
THEIR GOODS ACROSS TOWN AND NOT

02:03:13.953 --> 02:03:17.290 region:rollup2
ONLY BRIDGE GEOGRAPHIES OF THAT

02:03:15.622 --> 02:03:18.925 region:rollup2
REGION BUT ACTUALLY SELL TO NEW

02:03:17.290 --> 02:03:21.527 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE

02:03:18.925 --> 02:03:22.095 region:rollup2
NEVER SOLD TO BEFORE BEYOND JUST

02:03:21.527 --> 02:03:22.428 region:rollup2
THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THEIR

02:03:22.095 --> 02:03:25.164 region:rollup2
DINING ROOM.

02:03:22.428 --> 02:03:27.467 region:rollup2
SO FOR US FOOD DELIVERY OR ON

02:03:25.164 --> 02:03:28.468 region:rollup2
DEMAND DELIVERY IS WAY BIGGER

02:03:27.467 --> 02:03:30.770 region:rollup2
THAN JUST BEING.

02:03:28.468 --> 02:03:31.271 region:rollup2
LAZY ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND

02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:33.239 region:rollup2
TRYING TO GET SOMETHING

02:03:31.271 --> 02:03:34.474 region:rollup2
DELIVERED TO YOUR DOORSTEP IT'S

02:03:33.239 --> 02:03:36.376 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMING THE MARKET

02:03:34.474 --> 02:03:38.177 region:rollup2
APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY SMART

02:03:36.376 --> 02:03:39.679 region:rollup2
ALGORITHMS AND COMMERCE AS WE

02:03:38.177 --> 02:03:41.147 region:rollup2
KNOW IT AND WE CAN DO SO IN A

02:03:39.679 --> 02:03:42.749 region:rollup2
WAY THAT INVEST IN THE HELP OF

02:03:41.147 --> 02:03:43.716 region:rollup2
LOCAL ECONOMIES. AS OPPOSED TO

02:03:42.749 --> 02:03:45.451 region:rollup2
AT THE EXCLUSION OF THOSE LOCAL

02:03:43.716 --> 02:03:47.220 region:rollup2
ECONOMIES.

02:03:45.451 --> 02:03:48.888 region:rollup2
UP BUT A BIG PART OF THAT

02:03:47.220 --> 02:03:50.890 region:rollup2
NETWORK FOR POST MATE MATCHING

02:03:48.888 --> 02:03:53.026 region:rollup2
YOU THE CUSTOMER TO A MERCHANT

02:03:50.890 --> 02:03:54.227 region:rollup2
TO A CAREER IS POWERED BY THE

02:03:53.026 --> 02:03:55.762 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ON OUR

02:03:54.227 --> 02:03:56.529 region:rollup2
PART. WE CALL THEM POST MADE

02:03:55.762 --> 02:03:58.564 region:rollup2
I MENTIONED WE HAVE ABOUT A

02:03:56.529 --> 02:04:00.066 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACTIVE ON

02:03:58.564 --> 02:04:02.135 region:rollup2
OUR PLATFORM AT ANY GIVEN TIME.

02:04:00.066 --> 02:04:03.536 region:rollup2
ON BALANCE THEY EARN A BETWEEN

02:04:02.135 --> 02:04:05.238 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE

02:04:03.536 --> 02:04:06.839 region:rollup2
DOLLARS AN HOUR SO CERTAINLY

02:04:05.238 --> 02:04:08.474 region:rollup2
BETTER THAN MINIMUM WAGE IN MANY

02:04:06.839 --> 02:04:09.909 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS BUT WE ASK

02:04:08.474 --> 02:04:11.911 region:rollup2
OURSELVES A VERY SERIOUS

02:04:09.909 --> 02:04:13.379 region:rollup2
QUESTION. HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY DO

02:04:11.911 --> 02:04:15.581 region:rollup2
RIGHT BY THESE POST MATES AND

02:04:13.379 --> 02:04:17.150 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THEY CAN MAINTAIN

02:04:15.581 --> 02:04:18.818 region:rollup2
THOSE HIGH WAGES AND THE PREMISE

02:04:17.150 --> 02:04:20.586 region:rollup2
OF THE IS QUITE SIMPLE? IF WE

02:04:18.818 --> 02:04:21.888 region:rollup2
USE THE POST MAKES PLATFORM

02:04:20.586 --> 02:04:23.289 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW TO DELIVER TO THIS

02:04:21.888 --> 02:04:24.991 region:rollup2
BUILDING FROM THE STARBUCKS

02:04:23.289 --> 02:04:26.693 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STREET. A POST MAKE

02:04:24.991 --> 02:04:28.194 region:rollup2
CAREER WOULD BRING IT TO US BUT

02:04:26.693 --> 02:04:30.263 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY SINCE WE KNOW IT'S

02:04:28.194 --> 02:04:32.098 region:rollup2
JUST A FEW BLOCKS AWAY IT'S NOT

02:04:30.263 --> 02:04:32.832 region:rollup2
THAT ADVANTAGEOUS TO THEM SO WE

02:04:32.098 --> 02:04:34.334 region:rollup2
WOULD STARTED OUR

02:04:32.832 --> 02:04:36.369 region:rollup2
EXPERIMENTATION WITH AN A I

02:04:34.334 --> 02:04:37.971 region:rollup2
DRIVEN ROBOTIC SYSTEM. BECAUSE

02:04:36.369 --> 02:04:39.939 region:rollup2
WE WANTED TO KNOW HOW DO YOU

02:04:37.971 --> 02:04:41.708 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT YOUR RESERVING OUR

02:04:39.939 --> 02:04:42.775 region:rollup2
HUMAN CAREERS FOR LONGER

02:04:41.708 --> 02:04:43.943 region:rollup2
DISTANCE RUNS SO THAT WAY THEY

02:04:42.775 --> 02:04:46.212 region:rollup2
CAN MAKE MORE MONEY OFF THE

02:04:43.943 --> 02:04:48.114 region:rollup2
PLATFORM. NOT SHORT CHANGE THEM

02:04:46.212 --> 02:04:49.949 region:rollup2
AT HYPER SHORT DISTANCE RUNS BUT

02:04:48.114 --> 02:04:51.050 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME NOT PENALIZE

02:04:49.949 --> 02:04:53.353 region:rollup2
THAT COFFEE SHOP OR THAT

02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:55.521 region:rollup2
MERCHANT THAT'S CLOSE IN TO YOU

02:04:53.353 --> 02:04:55.722 region:rollup2
OR NEARBY DENSE DOWNTOWN URBAN

02:04:55.521 --> 02:04:56.990 region:rollup2
AREA.

02:04:55.722 --> 02:04:59.092 region:rollup2
AND THAT PREMISE.

02:04:56.990 --> 02:05:00.927 region:rollup2
WAS TOPPLED INITIALLY WITH THE

02:04:59.092 --> 02:05:02.462 region:rollup2
USE OF ROBOTICS WE STARTED IN

02:05:00.927 --> 02:05:05.131 region:rollup2
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WE'VE

02:05:02.462 --> 02:05:06.799 region:rollup2
EXPANDED IN VIRGINIA WISCONSIN

02:05:05.131 --> 02:05:09.702 region:rollup2
PARTS OF TEXAS PARTS OF THE BAY

02:05:06.799 --> 02:05:11.404 region:rollup2
AREA. AND WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS

02:05:09.702 --> 02:05:13.573 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SEE CAN WE USE A LITTLE

02:05:11.404 --> 02:05:14.774 region:rollup2
COOLER ON WHEELS THAT USES THE

02:05:13.573 --> 02:05:16.109 region:rollup2
SAME SIMILAR LIGHT OUR

02:05:14.774 --> 02:05:18.211 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IS NOT TAUGHT IN THIS

02:05:16.109 --> 02:05:19.412 region:rollup2
VEHICLE. AND IS SELF LEARNING SO

02:05:18.211 --> 02:05:21.447 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE

02:05:19.412 --> 02:05:23.383 region:rollup2
OBJECTS AROUND IT THROUGH OUR

02:05:21.447 --> 02:05:23.950 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN A AYE

02:05:23.383 --> 02:05:25.685 region:rollup2
CAPABILITIES

02:05:23.950 --> 02:05:27.186 region:rollup2
IT CAN HOW CAN IT MAKE SURE THAT

02:05:25.685 --> 02:05:29.288 region:rollup2
YOU CAN ACTUALLY LEARN ENOUGH SO

02:05:27.186 --> 02:05:30.690 region:rollup2
THAT WAY IT AVOIDS. A PEDESTRIAN

02:05:29.288 --> 02:05:32.392 region:rollup2
THAT MAYBE DISABLED AND ISN'T

02:05:30.690 --> 02:05:33.626 region:rollup2
USING A WALKING SICK OR IS IN A

02:05:32.392 --> 02:05:35.094 region:rollup2
WHEELCHAIR HOW DO WE MAKE SURE

02:05:33.626 --> 02:05:37.096 region:rollup2
THAT IT ACTUALLY TO YIELD TO

02:05:35.094 --> 02:05:39.332 region:rollup2
TRAFFIC PATTERNS. AND ALSO NOT

02:05:37.096 --> 02:05:41.134 region:rollup2
CLOG PARTICULARLY DENSE REGIONS

02:05:39.332 --> 02:05:42.034 region:rollup2
I EAT THE SIDEWALKS OF SAN

02:05:41.134 --> 02:05:44.170 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO.

02:05:42.034 --> 02:05:46.172 region:rollup2
AND I THINK FOR US WE STARTED

02:05:44.170 --> 02:05:47.807 region:rollup2
APPLYING THIS TECHNOLOGY ONE OUT

02:05:46.172 --> 02:05:48.975 region:rollup2
OF THE PROMISE OF TRYING TO MAKE

02:05:47.807 --> 02:05:50.309 region:rollup2
SURE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THAT

02:05:48.975 --> 02:05:52.044 region:rollup2
OUR CAREERS CAN BE RESERVED FOR

02:05:50.309 --> 02:05:53.946 region:rollup2
LONGER DISTANCE RUNS. BUT FROM

02:05:52.044 --> 02:05:55.248 region:rollup2
ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE IT'S THAT IF

02:05:53.946 --> 02:05:57.517 region:rollup2
YOU START WITH THAT EARLIER

02:05:55.248 --> 02:05:58.518 region:rollup2
POINT THE WAY COMMERCE INSISTS

02:05:57.517 --> 02:05:59.919 region:rollup2
IT IS MOVING IN CITIES IS

02:05:58.518 --> 02:06:01.187 region:rollup2
CHANGING THAT ALSO MEANS THAT

02:05:59.919 --> 02:06:01.788 region:rollup2
THERE ARE VERY UNIQUE URBAN

02:06:01.187 --> 02:06:03.356 region:rollup2
TOPOGRAPHIES IN EACH.

02:06:01.788 --> 02:06:04.857 region:rollup2
FIREMAN'S

02:06:03.356 --> 02:06:06.659 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE NOT GOING ABOUT THIS

02:06:04.857 --> 02:06:07.927 region:rollup2
PROMISE FOR THIS PRACTICE TO TRY

02:06:06.659 --> 02:06:10.063 region:rollup2
AND REPLACE OUR CAREERS

02:06:07.927 --> 02:06:11.497 region:rollup2
OVERNIGHT WERE ACTUALLY DOING SO

02:06:10.063 --> 02:06:12.865 region:rollup2
SIMPLY TO AUGMENT THAT EXIST

02:06:11.497 --> 02:06:14.667 region:rollup2
IF WE AND SEE HOW WE CAN BE

02:06:12.865 --> 02:06:16.135 region:rollup2
MINDFUL OF SUPER. SHORT

02:06:14.667 --> 02:06:18.404 region:rollup2
DISTANCES ALONG THE WAY.

02:06:16.135 --> 02:06:19.806 region:rollup2
ALL SAY THAT PER THE PURVIEW OF

02:06:18.404 --> 02:06:20.339 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE IN THIS HEARING

02:06:19.806 --> 02:06:21.607 region:rollup2
WE'VE LEARNED A COUPLE OF

02:06:20.339 --> 02:06:24.210 region:rollup2
INSIGHTS

02:06:21.607 --> 02:06:25.678 region:rollup2
ONE WE WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY

02:06:24.210 --> 02:06:26.245 region:rollup2
INTEGRATE THE ROBOTICS IN OUR

02:06:25.678 --> 02:06:27.346 region:rollup2
SUPPLY CHAIN STARTING IN THE

02:06:26.245 --> 02:06:28.781 region:rollup2
SEA.

02:06:27.346 --> 02:06:30.683 region:rollup2
WITHOUT IMPACTING A SINGLE HUMAN

02:06:28.781 --> 02:06:31.951 region:rollup2
JOB ON.

02:06:30.683 --> 02:06:33.719 region:rollup2
WE WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO

02:06:31.951 --> 02:06:34.187 region:rollup2
RESERVE OUR CAREERS TO MAKE MORE

02:06:33.719 --> 02:06:35.221 region:rollup2
MONEY BECAUSE OF THIS

02:06:34.187 --> 02:06:36.823 region:rollup2
EXPERIMENT.

02:06:35.221 --> 02:06:38.591 region:rollup2
TO WE WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO

02:06:36.823 --> 02:06:40.593 region:rollup2
DEPLOY FEWER CARS ON THE ROAD

02:06:38.591 --> 02:06:41.928 region:rollup2
VIA THE POST MAKES PLATFORM IN

02:06:40.593 --> 02:06:42.728 region:rollup2
SOME OF OUR SELECT TEST CITIES

02:06:41.928 --> 02:06:43.996 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA HARP

02:06:42.728 --> 02:06:45.264 region:rollup2
TATTERSALL'S IN THE BACK AND SAY

02:06:43.996 --> 02:06:46.766 region:rollup2
THAT THIS MEANS CONGESTION IS

02:06:45.264 --> 02:06:48.034 region:rollup2
GOING AWAY OVERNIGHT. BUT WE'RE

02:06:46.766 --> 02:06:49.235 region:rollup2
TAKING INCREMENTAL STEPS TO

02:06:48.034 --> 02:06:51.370 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTE TO THAT.

02:06:49.235 --> 02:06:52.805 region:rollup2
THREE WHEN IT CAME TO OUR

02:06:51.370 --> 02:06:55.241 region:rollup2
APPROACH OF DEPLOYING THESE IN

02:06:52.805 --> 02:06:56.742 region:rollup2
TOWNS WE TOOK A FUNDAMENTAL.

02:06:55.241 --> 02:06:58.144 region:rollup2
RESPECT FOR GOVERNMENT AND

02:06:56.742 --> 02:06:59.745 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE THAT FIRST MEANING

02:06:58.144 --> 02:07:01.547 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO NOT OPERATE A GO TO

02:06:59.745 --> 02:07:02.882 region:rollup2
MARKET WITHOUT TALKING TO LOCAL

02:07:01.547 --> 02:07:04.617 region:rollup2
MAYOR'S OFFICES STATE

02:07:02.882 --> 02:07:05.251 region:rollup2

PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT OF TRADE

02:07:05.251 --> 02:07:08.788 region:rollup2
PETITIONS AND PART OF THAT

02:07:06.619 --> 02:07:10.123 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK INSURED A DATA SHARE.

02:07:08.788 --> 02:07:10.556 region:rollup2
IN WHICH ANY DATA THAT WE WERE

02:07:10.123 --> 02:07:12.492 region:rollup2
GETTING OUT OF THE

02:07:10.556 --> 02:07:14.260 region:rollup2
EXPERIMENTATION INCLUDING ANY

02:07:12.492 --> 02:07:15.862 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES WE HAD AROUND PRIVACY

02:07:14.260 --> 02:07:17.196 region:rollup2
DISPOSAL IF THAT LIGHT OUR

02:07:15.862 --> 02:07:18.731 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY WAS MONITORING ARE

02:07:17.196 --> 02:07:20.132 region:rollup2
FILMING AROUND IT WE WOULD

02:07:18.731 --> 02:07:22.235 region:rollup2
ENSURE THE GOVERNMENT ON THEIR

02:07:20.132 --> 02:07:22.768 region:rollup2
TERMS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THAT

02:07:22.235 --> 02:07:23.402 region:rollup2
WE WOULD COMPLY WITH THEIR

02:07:22.768 --> 02:07:24.971 region:rollup2
NEEDS.

02:07:23.402 --> 02:07:26.973 region:rollup2
AND IT ACTUALLY ALLOWED US TO

02:07:24.971 --> 02:07:28.307 region:rollup2
WORK WITH THE NEW JOB TYPES WE

02:07:26.973 --> 02:07:29.642 region:rollup2

ROBOTICS.

02:07:47.627 --> 02:07:50.696 region:rollup2
BUT ULTIMATELY I'LL CONCLUDE

02:07:48.895 --> 02:07:52.932 region:rollup2
WITH THIS STATEMENT AND THAT IS

OTHER USE CASES OF A AYE THERE

02:07:56.702 --> 02:07:59.605 region:rollup2
ARE CHALLENGES AND AS WILL

02:07:57.837 --> 02:08:00.907 region:rollup2

ACTUALLY THE TEAMSTERS FOR

02:08:23.462 --> 02:08:27.199 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH ROBOTICS COMPANY IS

02:08:25.031 --> 02:08:28.801 region:rollup2
AN ICE. PACK SAN FRANCISCO CITY

TRIED TO BAN ROBOTICS WE WANT TO

02:08:30.803 --> 02:08:33.272 region:rollup2
WORK WITH LABOR TO MAKE SURE

02:08:32.104 --> 02:08:33.739 region:rollup2
THAT IF FOR TRAINING AND NEXT

02:08:33.272 --> 02:08:35.841 region:rollup2
GENERATION OR CURRENT

02:08:33.739 --> 02:08:37.810 region:rollup2
GENERATION.

02:08:35.841 --> 02:08:39.111 region:rollup2
OF HARDWARE MECHANICS AND THOSE

02:08:37.810 --> 02:08:40.613 region:rollup2
THAT DO NOT HAVE THESE FANCY

02:08:39.111 --> 02:08:41.914 region:rollup2
STANFORD COMPUTER SCIENCE DEGREE

02:08:40.613 --> 02:08:43.816 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO

02:08:41.914 --> 02:08:45.251 region:rollup2
ENGAGE THROUGH. VOCATIONAL

02:08:43.816 --> 02:08:46.886 region:rollup2

02:08:45.251 --> 02:08:48.754 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AND CONTINUOUS LEARNING

02:08:46.886 --> 02:08:50.156 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT CERTAINLY EXTEND

02:08:48.754 --> 02:08:51.290 region:rollup2
BE ON THE STEM INVESTMENTS THAT

02:08:50.156 --> 02:08:54.360 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO MAKE IT AN EARLIER

02:08:51.290 --> 02:08:55.161 region:rollup2
STAGE LEVEL BUT CAN ALSO ACCOUNT

02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:57.263 region:rollup2
FOR LATER STAGE INVESTMENT.

02:08:55.161 --> 02:09:00.032 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY I THINK THAT IF WE

02:08:57.263 --> 02:09:00.933 region:rollup2
GIVE OURSELVES AND GIVE INDUSTRY

02:09:00.032 --> 02:09:02.335 region:rollup2
I HAVE BECOME A THE PITCH

02:09:00.933 --> 02:09:04.437 region:rollup2
THEY'VE WILL GIVE INDUSTRY THE

02:09:02.335 --> 02:09:05.838 region:rollup2
CHANCE TO EXPERIMENT AND WE USE

02:09:04.437 --> 02:09:07.673 region:rollup2
CITIES OR USE YOUR DISTRICTS ARE

02:09:05.838 --> 02:09:09.408 region:rollup2
YOU STATES. AS THE PETRI DISH OF

02:09:07.673 --> 02:09:11.344 region:rollup2
TESTING THEN THE MORE DATA THAT

02:09:09.408 --> 02:09:12.144 region:rollup2
WE GET THE MORE WE CAN SHARE

02:09:11.344 --> 02:09:13.346 region:rollup2
BACK OF THE GOVERNMENT.

02:09:12.144 --> 02:09:15.181 region:rollup2
THE MORE THAT WE TEST THESE

02:09:13.346 --> 02:09:16.782 region:rollup2
TOOLS THE MORE THAT A AYE WHICH

02:09:15.181 --> 02:09:18.517 region:rollup2
IS SELF LEARNING CAN ACTUALLY

02:09:16.782 --> 02:09:20.219 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT FOR STRUCTURAL BIASES

02:09:18.517 --> 02:09:21.420 region:rollup2
AND IMPROVE OVER TIME AND THE

02:09:20.219 --> 02:09:22.588 region:rollup2
MORE WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE

02:09:21.420 --> 02:09:24.757 region:rollup2
THERE ARE GAPS ARE THAT WE NEED

02:09:22.588 --> 02:09:25.925 region:rollup2
TO TACKLE TOGETHER. SO THERE'S A

02:09:24.757 --> 02:09:26.926 region:rollup2
LOT OF INVESTMENT THAT NEEDS TO

02:09:25.925 --> 02:09:28.427 region:rollup2
HAPPEN IN THIS SPACE TO TRULY

02:09:26.926 --> 02:09:30.129 region:rollup2
ACTUALIZE IT THERE'S A LOT OF

02:09:28.427 --> 02:09:31.497 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THAT WE AS

02:09:30.129 --> 02:09:33.532 region:rollup2
A TECH COMPANY WANT TO TAKE A

02:09:31.497 --> 02:09:35.768 region:rollup2
PARDON SO WE SUPPORT BILLS GOING

02:09:33.532 --> 02:09:36.869 region:rollup2
ON IN THIS. LEGISLATURE WHEN TO

02:09:35.768 --> 02:09:38.371 region:rollup2
COME SYSTEM INVESTMENT FOR

02:09:36.869 --> 02:09:39.805 region:rollup2
CONTINUOUS LEARNING INVESTMENTS

02:09:38.371 --> 02:09:41.140 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO WANT THE ROOM TO

02:09:39.805 --> 02:09:42.942 region:rollup2
TEST SO THAT WAY WE CAN BE

02:09:41.140 --> 02:09:46.078 region:rollup2
WORKING PARTNERS AS OPPOSE TO

02:09:42.942 --> 02:09:46.712 region:rollup2
SPARRING PARTNERS. CALIFORNIA

02:09:46.078 --> 02:09:47.079 region:rollup2
DOESN'T JUST COMPETE WITH OTHER

02:09:46.712 --> 02:09:47.813 region:rollup2
STATES.

02:09:47.079 --> 02:09:49.715 region:rollup2
WE CAN BE WITH THE REST THE

02:09:47.813 --> 02:09:51.584 region:rollup2
WORLD SO FRANKLY FOR US THIS IS

02:09:49.715 --> 02:09:52.218 region:rollup2
ALSO ABOUT THE COMPETITIVENESS

02:09:51.584 --> 02:09:54.320 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE THAT WE GET TO CALL

02:09:52.218 --> 02:09:55.087 region:rollup2

THEM THAT I SECRETLY.

02:09:59.625 --> 02:10:03.496 region:rollup2
DATA

02:10:01.193 --> 02:10:05.164 region:rollup2
PLAGUE. THAT MISTAKEN NUMBER

02:10:03.496 --> 02:10:06.899 region:rollup2
FOUND.

02:10:05.164 --> 02:10:07.767 region:rollup2
I THANK YOU VERY ME SO I

02:10:06.899 --> 02:10:09.368 region:rollup2

MIND STRONG HOW.

02:10:09.368 --> 02:10:14.006 region:rollup2
BY WAY BACKGROUND I'M A

02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:15.708 region:rollup2
COMPUTER SCIENTIST PHD AND MD

02:10:14.006 --> 02:10:17.076 region:rollup2
FROM STANFORD AND RESIDENTS AT

02:10:15.708 --> 02:10:19.412 region:rollup2
STANFORD.

02:10:17.076 --> 02:10:20.313 region:rollup2
AND I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT

02:10:19.412 --> 02:10:23.549 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:10:20.313 --> 02:10:24.917 region:rollup2
HOW WE'RE FEELING A SHORTAGE OF

02:10:23.549 --> 02:10:27.553 region:rollup2
PURSES?

02:10:24.917 --> 02:10:29.588 region:rollup2
DISPLACING SERVICE WORKERS.

02:10:27.553 --> 02:10:30.956 region:rollup2
AT MY SON HELP WE'VE DEVELOPED

02:10:29.588 --> 02:10:32.391 region:rollup2
A WHEN THE BIG CHALLENGES MENTAL

02:10:30.956 --> 02:10:34.293 region:rollup2
HEALTH WERE DRESSING MENTAL

02:10:32.391 --> 02:10:35.027 region:rollup2
HEALTH ISSUE THERE'S A CABINET

02:10:34.293 --> 02:10:36.495 region:rollup2
JANET DISORDERS.

02:10:35.027 --> 02:10:37.930 region:rollup2
IN THE BIG CHALLENGE HAS BEEN

02:10:36.495 --> 02:10:40.032 region:rollup2
ACCESS AND MEASUREMENT.

02:10:37.930 --> 02:10:41.634 region:rollup2
SO IN MENTAL HEALTH TODAY OUR

02:10:40.032 --> 02:10:43.069 region:rollup2
STATISTICS ARE NOT IMPRESSIVE

02:10:41.634 --> 02:10:44.036 region:rollup2
ONE IN THREE PATIENTS WITH

02:10:43.069 --> 02:10:44.970 region:rollup2
SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS CAN BE

02:10:44.036 --> 02:10:46.205 region:rollup2
ADMITTED.

02:10:44.970 --> 02:10:47.840 region:rollup2
EVERY TWELVE MONTHS INTO THE

02:10:46.205 --> 02:10:49.342 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL.

02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:51.811 region:rollup2
WHEN INTO PETITIONS HE'S GOING

02:10:49.342 --> 02:10:53.813 region:rollup2
TO PATIENTS WITH A SUBSTANCE USE

02:10:51.811 --> 02:10:55.448 region:rollup2
DISORDER AN OPIATE USE DISORDER

02:10:53.813 --> 02:10:56.615 region:rollup2
GARY ADMITTED EVERY TWELVE

02:10:55.448 --> 02:10:57.917 region:rollup2
MONTHS.

02:10:56.615 --> 02:11:00.319 region:rollup2
IT'S THAT THEY WERE IT WE'RE NOT

02:10:57.917 --> 02:11:02.621 region:rollup2
DOING VERY GOOD AT MANAGING A

02:11:00.319 --> 02:11:03.956 region:rollup2
WHAT'S BECOMING A CRISIS LUNCHES

02:11:02.621 --> 02:11:06.325 region:rollup2
HERE IN THIS COUNTRY BUT.

02:11:03.956 --> 02:11:08.194 region:rollup2
A GLOBAL CRISIS MENTAL HEALTH

02:11:06.325 --> 02:11:10.162 region:rollup2
CRISIS IN WHAT WE'VE DEVELOPED

02:11:08.194 --> 02:11:11.630 region:rollup2
IN SMART IT'S. A AYE TRIP THEN

02:11:10.162 --> 02:11:12.365 region:rollup2
IT'S TAKEN SIX YEARS OF ARE

02:11:11.630 --> 02:11:15.000 region:rollup2
INDEED.

02:11:12.365 --> 02:11:16.769 region:rollup2
EXCEPT A A LOT OF INVESTMENT A

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:18.137 region:rollup2
LOT OF TIME AND AND AND A LOT OF

02:11:16.769 --> 02:11:20.940 region:rollup2
SACRIFICE FROM BROUGH VERY

02:11:18.137 --> 02:11:23.642 region:rollup2
TALENTED TEAM. IS THE ABILITY TO

02:11:20.940 --> 02:11:26.011 region:rollup2
PASSIVELY ACQUIRED DATA FROM

02:11:23.642 --> 02:11:27.413 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SMARTPHONE THAT DIGITAL

02:11:26.011 --> 02:11:29.315 region:rollup2
HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION DATA

02:11:27.413 --> 02:11:30.983 region:rollup2
AND BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND

02:11:29.315 --> 02:11:32.585 region:rollup2
REPRODUCE GOLD STANDARD NO

02:11:30.983 --> 02:11:34.353 region:rollup2
COGNITIVE METRICS FOR FOR THESE

02:11:32.585 --> 02:11:36.088 region:rollup2
PATIENTS WE CAN NOW UNDERSTAND

02:11:34.353 --> 02:11:37.857 region:rollup2
HOW SOMEONE. IS FUNCTIONING

02:11:36.088 --> 02:11:39.091 region:rollup2
COGNITIVELY WE CAN UNDERSTAND

02:11:37.857 --> 02:11:41.060 region:rollup2
HOW THEY'RE DOING EMOTIONALLY

02:11:39.091 --> 02:11:42.194 region:rollup2
ARE IN THEIR ENVIRONMENTS WHERE

02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:44.997 region:rollup2
IT MATTERS MOST.

02:11:42.194 --> 02:11:46.432 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE POTENTIALLY SEE A

02:11:44.997 --> 02:11:47.833 region:rollup2
HAVING DIFFICULTY COPING

02:11:46.432 --> 02:11:49.735 region:rollup2
STRESSING?

02:11:47.833 --> 02:11:50.603 region:rollup2
AND WENT WHERE THINGS

02:11:49.735 --> 02:11:52.972 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY WHERE.

02:11:50.603 --> 02:11:55.207 region:rollup2
IT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT BAD

02:11:52.972 --> 02:11:56.375 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES LIKE SUICIDE IT HAPPENS

02:11:55.207 --> 02:11:59.412 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT DOES THE DOES NOT

02:11:56.375 --> 02:12:00.246 region:rollup2
HAPPEN THE CLINIC IT HAPPENS AT

02:11:59.412 --> 02:12:00.913 region:rollup2
TWO IN THE MORNING SOMETIMES.

02:12:00.246 --> 02:12:02.948 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE DEVELOPED

02:12:00.913 --> 02:12:04.750 region:rollup2
AND THE OTHER ASPECT OF THIS IS

02:12:02.948 --> 02:12:06.252 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE NOT JUST THE

02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:08.220 region:rollup2
MEASUREMENT TOWNS BUT TO BE ABLE

02:12:06.252 --> 02:12:10.289 region:rollup2
TO SOLVE THE ACCESS PROBLEM THE

02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:11.590 region:rollup2
ACCESS PROBLEM TO HELP. ALICE'S

02:12:10.289 --> 02:12:13.225 region:rollup2
NIGHTS IS GOOD ENOUGH TO KNOW

02:12:11.590 --> 02:12:14.493 region:rollup2
THAT SOMEONE'S IN TROUBLE IT'S

02:12:13.225 --> 02:12:17.062 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO

02:12:14.493 --> 02:12:18.330 region:rollup2
DELIVER HELP AND THE MOBILE

02:12:17.062 --> 02:12:20.499 region:rollup2
PHONE THE SMARTPHONE IS THE

02:12:18.330 --> 02:12:22.535 region:rollup2
PERFECT TOOL PERFECT DEVICE FOR

02:12:20.499 --> 02:12:24.270 region:rollup2
TELEHEALTH WE'VE DEVELOPED. A

02:12:22.535 --> 02:12:25.104 region:rollup2
MODEL OF INTERACTIVE HEALTH.

02:12:24.270 --> 02:12:27.473 region:rollup2
THAT TAKES BAD.

02:12:25.104 --> 02:12:29.842 region:rollup2
INITIAL SIGNAL AND DELIVERS

02:12:27.473 --> 02:12:32.211 region:rollup2
VERY QUICKLY A MIND STRONG A AYE

02:12:29.842 --> 02:12:34.313 region:rollup2
SOLUTION THAT INTERVENES USING.

02:12:32.211 --> 02:12:36.248 region:rollup2
NATURAL LANGUAGE INTERACTION

02:12:34.313 --> 02:12:38.484 region:rollup2
WITH A WITH A PERSON TO BE ABLE

02:12:36.248 --> 02:12:40.219 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION AND

02:12:38.484 --> 02:12:42.021 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO QUICKLY ESCALATE A

02:12:40.219 --> 02:12:43.155 region:rollup2
SITUATION TO EIGHT ACT I CARE

02:12:42.021 --> 02:12:45.157 region:rollup2
PROVIDER. IF.

02:12:43.155 --> 02:12:48.627 region:rollup2
THAT IF IT'S URGENT AND.

02:12:45.157 --> 02:12:48.928 region:rollup2
NEEDS IT NEEDS IMMEDIATE

02:12:48.627 --> 02:12:49.628 region:rollup2
ATTENTION.

02:12:48.928 --> 02:12:50.963 region:rollup2
SO FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE WHAT WE

02:12:49.628 --> 02:12:52.031 region:rollup2
HAVE IS WE HAVE THE ABILITY NOW

02:12:50.963 --> 02:12:54.600 region:rollup2
TO.

02:12:52.031 --> 02:12:56.235 region:rollup2
CARE FOR A A VERY.

02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:57.470 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT A SET OF.

02:12:56.235 --> 02:12:58.471 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

02:12:57.470 --> 02:12:59.405 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:12:58.471 --> 02:13:00.506 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN LARGELY

02:12:59.405 --> 02:13:01.440 region:rollup2
DISENFRANCHISED.

02:13:00.506 --> 02:13:03.375 region:rollup2
AND.

02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:04.710 region:rollup2
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT OUR

02:13:03.375 --> 02:13:06.445 region:rollup2
APPROACH AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IS

02:13:04.710 --> 02:13:08.180 region:rollup2
THAT MENTAL HEALTH IS NOT JUST A

02:13:06.445 --> 02:13:10.683 region:rollup2
FIRST WORLD PROBLEM IS A GLOBAL

02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:12.384 region:rollup2
PROBLEM AND WE HAVE NO SOLUTION

02:13:10.683 --> 02:13:13.986 region:rollup2
THAT NOT JUST. ADDRESSES MENTAL

02:13:12.384 --> 02:13:15.688 region:rollup2
HEALTH ISSUES IN THIS COUNTRY

02:13:13.986 --> 02:13:17.122 region:rollup2
BUT POTENTIALLY GET THAT LEAK

02:13:15.688 --> 02:13:20.159 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAN

02:13:17.122 --> 02:13:20.793 region:rollup2
ALLOW US TO ADDRESS A CHALLENGES

02:13:20.159 --> 02:13:21.060 region:rollup2
AND OTHER THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES

02:13:20.793 --> 02:13:23.329 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

02:13:21.060 --> 02:13:24.830 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S ON THE GOOD SIDE AND I

02:13:23.329 --> 02:13:27.766 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S ALL VERY EXCITING WE

02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:28.901 region:rollup2
pAN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK WITH

02:13:27.766 --> 02:13:30.603 region:rollup2
SOME THE TOP.

02:13:28.901 --> 02:13:32.605 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES AND ACADEMIC

02:13:30.603 --> 02:13:34.773 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY.

02:13:32.605 --> 02:13:36.308 region:rollup2
AND WE DO THAT IN A PRO BONO.

02:13:34.773 --> 02:13:38.744 region:rollup2
MODEL WHERE WE DON'T WE DON'T

02:13:36.308 --> 02:13:40.179 region:rollup2
CHARGE THEM ANYTHING WE DO

02:13:38.744 --> 02:13:41.547 region:rollup2
ENORMOUS WANNA WORK WITH.

02:13:40.179 --> 02:13:44.250 region:rollup2
DRUG MANUFACTURERS.

02:13:41.547 --> 02:13:45.684 region:rollup2
TO IN ADOPTING A NEW DRUGS

02:13:44.250 --> 02:13:47.253 region:rollup2
TARGETED UP PHARMACEUTICALS.

02:13:45.684 --> 02:13:49.521 region:rollup2
AND THAT OUR LICENSE HERE

02:13:47.253 --> 02:13:50.723 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL PLATFORM IN WE'RE

02:13:49.521 --> 02:13:52.525 region:rollup2
INVOLVED WITH SOME OF THIS

02:13:50.723 --> 02:13:53.192 region:rollup2
COUNTRY'S LARGEST PAIR PROVIDERS

02:13:52.525 --> 02:13:58.197 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS.

02:13:53.192 --> 02:13:58.197 region:rollup2
TO HELP ADDRESS THIS THIS

02:13:58.264 --> 02:14:03.402 region:rollup2
EXCITING USE OF A AYE I THINK.

02:14:00.1000 --> 02:14:04.370 region:rollup2
YOU IT IT. IF THERE WERE A

02:14:03.402 --> 02:14:06.939 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL.

02:14:04.370 --> 02:14:08.974 region:rollup2
CONCERNED IT WOULD BE A AND

02:14:06.939 --> 02:14:10.776 region:rollup2
YEAH POTENTIAL MISUSE OF THIS

02:14:08.974 --> 02:14:12.544 region:rollup2
TYPE APPROACH AS YOU'RE THINKING

02:14:10.776 --> 02:14:14.213 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE THE YOUNG THE.

02:14:12.544 --> 02:14:17.416 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS OPPORTUNITIES AND.

02:14:14.213 --> 02:14:17.616 region:rollup2
RISKS OF A AYE YEAH I WOULD SAY

02:14:17.416 --> 02:14:18.551 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:14:17.616 --> 02:14:20.486 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE DIRECT TO CONSUMER

02:14:18.551 --> 02:14:22.121 region:rollup2
MODEL COULD COULD BE.

02:14:20.486 --> 02:14:24.189 region:rollup2
.

02:14:22.121 --> 02:14:25.724 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD WE GO DIRECTLY THROUGH

02:14:24.189 --> 02:14:26.792 region:rollup2
THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND IF

02:14:25.724 --> 02:14:27.393 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING DIRECT CONSUMER

02:14:26.792 --> 02:14:28.861 region:rollup2
MODEL.

02:14:27.393 --> 02:14:29.328 region:rollup2
THERE MIGHT BE SOME CONCERNS IN

02:14:28.861 --> 02:14:31.797 region:rollup2
TERMS OF.

02:14:29.328 --> 02:14:33.365 region:rollup2
HOW PATIENT OR PERSON WOULD?

02:14:31.797 --> 02:14:35.868 region:rollup2
USES TECHNOLOGY.

02:14:33.365 --> 02:14:37.369 region:rollup2
AND POTENTIALLY AND MISUSES OF

02:14:35.868 --> 02:14:38.737 region:rollup2
THE OF THE ABILITY TO MEASURE A

02:14:37.369 --> 02:14:40.573 region:rollup2
COGNITION AND MOOD.

02:14:38.737 --> 02:14:42.608 region:rollup2
IN IN THE FORM OF NARROW NO

02:14:40.573 --> 02:14:44.109 region:rollup2
MARKETING AND OTHER SUCH

02:14:42.608 --> 02:14:45.277 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS BUT I THINK THAT.

02:14:44.109 --> 02:14:46.412 region:rollup2
IN IN IT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

02:14:45.277 --> 02:14:48.614 region:rollup2
WE'RE VERY EXCITED.

02:14:46.412 --> 02:14:50.115 region:rollup2
WITH WHAT WE'VE DEVELOPED AND.

02:14:48.614 --> 02:14:53.252 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY AND HOPE THAT

02:14:50.115 --> 02:14:54.787 region:rollup2
WOULD BRING TO A LARGE POT.

02:14:53.252 --> 02:14:56.355 region:rollup2
SEGMENT OF POPULATION THANK YOU.

02:14:54.787 --> 02:14:58.557 region:rollup2
GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ES

02:14:56.355 --> 02:15:01.293 region:rollup2
NEXT SO CAN WE GO TO MISTER IMAD

02:14:58.557 --> 02:15:03.295 region:rollup2
KEIKO.

02:15:01.293 --> 02:15:05.230 region:rollup2
I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY

02:15:03.295 --> 02:15:07.266 region:rollup2
TO DISCUSS SOME PRESSING ISSUES

02:15:05.230 --> 02:15:07.800 region:rollup2
IN POLICY CONSIDERATIONS RELATED

02:15:07.266 --> 02:15:09.401 region:rollup2
TO THE FIELD OF ARTIFICIAL

02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:10.869 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE.

02:15:09.401 --> 02:15:12.438 region:rollup2
MY NAME IS MAC HAGEL AND I AM A

ATTORNEY AT THE ACLU OF NORTHERN

02:15:13.706 --> 02:15:19.044 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND BASINS ARE CISCO.

02:15:16.542 --> 02:15:19.778 region:rollup2
SO SO MUCH MY WORK FOCUSES ON

02:15:19.044 --> 02:15:21.113 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT MODERN DIGITAL

02:15:19.778 --> 02:15:22.247 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS.

02:15:21.113 --> 02:15:24.350 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY BE PRIVATE

02:15:22.247 --> 02:15:26.118 region:rollup2
PLATFORMS ARE PUBLIC PROJECTS

02:15:24.350 --> 02:15:27.786 region:rollup2
ARE PUBLICLY DEBATED AND

02:15:26.118 --> 02:15:29.321 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED WITH EQUALITY AND

02:15:27.786 --> 02:15:30.155 region:rollup2
JUSTICE AND MINE.

02:15:29.321 --> 02:15:32.725 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT IN MIND.

02:15:30.155 --> 02:15:34.326 region:rollup2
I WANNA TALK MORE BIG PICTURE

02:15:32.725 --> 02:15:36.462 region:rollup2
ABOUT A AYE. SO YOU MAY ALREADY

02:15:34.326 --> 02:15:38.030 region:rollup2
BE FAMILIAR WITH A AYE POWERED

02:15:36.462 --> 02:15:40.599 region:rollup2
AYE VOICE ASSISTANCE AND STORIES

02:15:38.030 --> 02:15:42.001 region:rollup2
DESCRIBING HOW A AYE IS GOING TO

02:15:40.599 --> 02:15:43.302 region:rollup2
BRING ABOUT SELF DRIVING CARS.

02:15:42.001 --> 02:15:45.337 region:rollup2
AYE BUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

02:15:43.302 --> 02:15:46.839 region:rollup2
WITH ITS POWER TO FIND PATTERNS

02:15:45.337 --> 02:15:47.940 region:rollup2
IN LARGE DATA SETS.

02:15:46.839 --> 02:15:49.742 region:rollup2
AND TO AUTOMATE DECISIONS

02:15:47.940 --> 02:15:51.477 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY LEFT.

02:15:49.742 --> 02:15:53.245 region:rollup2
TO HUMANS IS POISED A

02:15:51.477 --> 02:15:54.713 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORM THE

02:15:53.245 --> 02:15:56.849 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PEOPLES

02:15:54.713 --> 02:15:57.916 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AND THEIR GOVERNMENTS.

02:15:56.849 --> 02:15:59.351 region:rollup2
I'LL A AYE POWER SYSTEMS THAT

02:15:57.916 --> 02:16:00.853 region:rollup2
FOR IT FACILITATE PERVASIVE

02:15:59.351 --> 02:16:01.854 region:rollup2
SURVEILLANCE AND INFLUENCE

02:16:00.853 --> 02:16:03.322 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENTIAL ON PERSONAL

02:16:01.854 --> 02:16:04.790 region:rollup2
DECISIONS.

02:16:03.322 --> 02:16:06.191 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WHEN DEPLOYED WITHOUT

02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:07.826 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE

02:16:06.191 --> 02:16:09.728 region:rollup2
RAISE THE RISK.

02:16:07.826 --> 02:16:10.963 region:rollup2
CRADLE TO GRAVE TRACKING. THAT

02:16:09.728 --> 02:16:12.564 region:rollup2
IS INCONSISTENT WITH CALIFORNIA

02:16:10.963 --> 02:16:14.400 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF FREE

02:16:12.564 --> 02:16:16.235 region:rollup2
SPEECH AND PRIVACY.

02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:18.671 region:rollup2
IN THESE EFFORTS APPLICATIONS A

02:16:16.235 --> 02:16:20.039 region:rollup2
AYE IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF QUOTE

02:16:18.671 --> 02:16:22.141 region:rollup2
MODERNS THREAT TO PERSONAL

02:16:20.039 --> 02:16:23.876 region:rollup2
PRIVACY. THAT ARTICLE ONE

02:16:22.141 --> 02:16:25.744 region:rollup2
SECTION ONE OF OUR CONSTITUTION

02:16:23.876 --> 02:16:27.780 region:rollup2
WAS INTENDED TO ADDRESS.

02:16:25.744 --> 02:16:28.947 region:rollup2
BASIC DUE PROCESS AND FAIRNESS

02:16:27.780 --> 02:16:30.816 region:rollup2
IS ALSO UNDERMINED WHEN

02:16:28.947 --> 02:16:32.785 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS AFFECTING

02:16:30.816 --> 02:16:34.653 region:rollup2
OUR LIVES SUCH AS WHERE PUBLIC

02:16:32.785 --> 02:16:36.655 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ARE DEPLOYED OR

02:16:34.653 --> 02:16:38.424 region:rollup2
WHETHER AN OFFICER. CONFRONTS A

02:16:36.655 --> 02:16:39.858 region:rollup2
PERSON WITH DEADLY FORCE ARE

02:16:38.424 --> 02:16:40.959 region:rollup2
INFLUENCED BY PROPRIETARY

02:16:39.858 --> 02:16:43.362 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS RUNNING SECRET

02:16:40.959 --> 02:16:44.963 region:rollup2
ALGORITHMS ANALYZING POTENTIALLY

02:16:43.362 --> 02:16:45.864 region:rollup2
BIAS DATA.

02:16:44.963 --> 02:16:47.766 region:rollup2
AND WITHOUT RULES IN PLACE TO

02:16:45.864 --> 02:16:49.268 region:rollup2
PREVENT ABUSE.

02:16:47.766 --> 02:16:50.769 region:rollup2
SO THE STAKES FOR A AYE SYSTEMS

02:16:49.268 --> 02:16:52.371 region:rollup2
ARE PARTICULARLY HIGH ESPECIALLY

02:16:50.769 --> 02:16:53.672 region:rollup2
IN RIGHT AND IN THE CURRENT

02:16:52.371 --> 02:16:55.174 region:rollup2
POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CLIMATE.

02:16:53.672 --> 02:16:57.176 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

02:16:55.174 --> 02:16:58.977 region:rollup2
RUSHING TO EXPLOIT AUTOMATED

02:16:57.176 --> 02:17:00.746 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS AT LOCAL LEVEL IN

02:16:58.977 --> 02:17:01.947 region:rollup2
VIOLATION OF THIS LEGISLATURE'S

02:17:00.746 --> 02:17:03.682 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT TO PROTECT IMMIGRANT

02:17:01.947 --> 02:17:04.950 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

02:17:03.682 --> 02:17:06.485 region:rollup2
THEY WANT YOU SEE SYSTEMS TO

02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:08.153 region:rollup2
TRACK TARGET AND THE POOR

02:17:06.485 --> 02:17:10.422 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS.

02:17:08.153 --> 02:17:11.390 region:rollup2
WE MUST NOT LET THIS HAPPEN.

02:17:10.422 --> 02:17:12.357 region:rollup2
WE ARE ENCOURAGED THAT THIS

02:17:11.390 --> 02:17:14.593 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE IS THOUGHTFULLY

02:17:12.357 --> 02:17:16.028 region:rollup2
EXPLORING A TODAY AND AND HOW WE

02:17:14.593 --> 02:17:17.296 region:rollup2
CAN SAFEGUARD THE RIGHTS OF ALL

02:17:16.028 --> 02:17:18.630 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS.

02:17:17.296 --> 02:17:20.666 region:rollup2
SO ADDRESSING POLICY ISSUES

02:17:18.630 --> 02:17:21.900 region:rollup2
RELATED CA I. AND ITS USE IN THE

02:17:20.666 --> 02:17:22.968 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT CONTEXT IS CRITICAL

02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:23.902 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A AYE IS ALREADY

02:17:22.968 --> 02:17:26.638 region:rollup2
POWERING SURVEILLANCE

02:17:23.902 --> 02:17:28.140 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES HEARING CALIFORNIA.

02:17:26.638 --> 02:17:30.142 region:rollup2
INCLUDING SOFTWARE THAT SCOURS

02:17:28.140 --> 02:17:31.777 region:rollup2
BILLIONS OF SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS

02:17:30.142 --> 02:17:34.046 region:rollup2
BIOMETRIC SYSTEMS THAT SCAN

02:17:31.777 --> 02:17:35.714 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S FACES AND EYES LIKE A

THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE BUILT ON

02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:18.690 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ARE

02:23:57.596 --> 02:23:59.931 region:rollup2
INTRUSIVE.

02:23:58.697 --> 02:24:01.700 region:rollup2
.

02:23:59.931 --> 02:24:03.168 region:rollup2
USING IT FOR NEFARIOUS PURPOSES

02:24:01.700 --> 02:24:04.936 region:rollup2
TO TRACK YOU DOWN.

02:24:03.168 --> 02:24:07.038 region:rollup2

BIT THAT ARE SO I MEAN AND ON

02:24:12.010 --> 02:24:14.613 region:rollup2
THE OTHER SIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:24:13.211 --> 02:24:15.147 region:rollup2
WE WOULD SAY THAT WE USE THE

02:24:14.613 --> 02:24:15.747 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY TO PROTECT OUR

02:24:15.147 --> 02:24:18.683 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

02:24:15.747 --> 02:24:19.184 region:rollup2
WERE FACING INCREASING THREATS

02:24:18.683 --> 02:24:21.219 region:rollup2
AND WE SEE THESE THESE.

02:24:19.184 --> 02:24:23.221 region:rollup2
.

02:24:21.219 --> 02:24:25.790 region:rollup2
MASS EVENTS OF VIOLENCE.

02:24:23.221 --> 02:24:27.893 region:rollup2
IT EVERY SO OFTEN IT SEEMS LIKE

02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:29.060 region:rollup2
MORE AND MORE. AND THEN I'D KNOW

02:24:27.893 --> 02:24:30.328 region:rollup2
CHECKS US ALL OF THE CORE AND WE

02:24:29.060 --> 02:24:31.296 region:rollup2
TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN

02:24:30.328 --> 02:24:32.864 region:rollup2
WE DO TO PREVENT IT AND

02:24:31.296 --> 02:24:34.032 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IS A SOLUTION IT'S

02:24:32.864 --> 02:24:35.400 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE A.

02:24:34.032 --> 02:24:36.601 region:rollup2
SOME IT'S USEFUL TO SAVE A LOT

02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:37.903 region:rollup2
OF LIVES BUT THERE IS GONNA BE A

02:24:36.601 --> 02:24:39.804 region:rollup2
BALLOTS THAT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE

02:24:37.903 --> 02:24:40.872 region:rollup2
STRUCK BETWEEN OUR TWO SIDES.

02:24:39.804 --> 02:24:41.907 region:rollup2
ON WHERE'D WHERE'D IS.

02:24:40.872 --> 02:24:43.675 region:rollup2
PUBLIC INPUT.

02:24:41.907 --> 02:24:45.677 region:rollup2
.

02:24:43.675 --> 02:24:46.411 region:rollup2
ALLOW THE CITIZENS TO HAVE SOME

02:24:45.677 --> 02:24:47.712 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE'RE

02:24:46.411 --> 02:24:49.181 region:rollup2
DOING AND WHERE TO GO TOO FAR TO

02:24:47.712 --> 02:24:49.781 region:rollup2
WEAR ALLOWS.

02:24:49.181 --> 02:24:50.916 region:rollup2
OFFENDERS AND PERPETRATORS.

02:24:49.781 --> 02:24:52.651 region:rollup2
.

02:24:50.916 --> 02:24:54.319 region:rollup2
AN ADVANTAGE AGAINST US

02:24:52.651 --> 02:24:55.520 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THE DEBATE THAT WE'RE

02:24:54.319 --> 02:24:56.888 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAVE A YOU KNOW

02:24:55.520 --> 02:24:58.590 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY HERE IT'S

02:24:56.888 --> 02:25:00.358 region:rollup2
ALREADY. IT'S ARTIFICIAL

02:24:58.590 --> 02:25:03.161 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE BEING USED BY A

02:25:00.358 --> 02:25:04.329 region:rollup2
BUSINESS IS HEALTH COMPANIES.

02:25:03.161 --> 02:25:05.730 region:rollup2
WHEN OUR SOCCER.

02:25:04.329 --> 02:25:07.199 region:rollup2
CYBER DEFENSES LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:25:05.730 --> 02:25:08.099 region:rollup2
.

02:25:07.199 --> 02:25:09.234 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC HAS IT YOU KNOW WHERE

02:25:08.099 --> 02:25:10.769 region:rollup2
IT'S.

02:25:09.234 --> 02:25:12.804 region:rollup2
A.

02:25:10.769 --> 02:25:14.372 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU TALK ABOUT.

02:25:12.804 --> 02:25:18.009 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT IT YOU KNOW OUR

02:25:14.372 --> 02:25:19.711 region:rollup2
PERSONAL. LIVES BEING.

02:25:18.009 --> 02:25:21.346 region:rollup2
CONSTANTLY FOLLOWED CONSTANTLY

02:25:19.711 --> 02:25:22.414 region:rollup2
MONITORED AND IT'S IT'S ALREADY

02:25:21.346 --> 02:25:23.248 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IF IT'S NOT LAW

02:25:22.414 --> 02:25:25.917 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT ITS MARKETING

02:25:23.248 --> 02:25:27.552 region:rollup2
COMPANIES THAT.

02:25:25.917 --> 02:25:29.154 region:rollup2
YOUR FRIENDS POSTING PHOTOS OF

02:25:27.552 --> 02:25:30.722 region:rollup2
YOU EVERYWHERE YOU GO. MINUTES

02:25:29.154 --> 02:25:32.224 region:rollup2
IT'S THERE SO LET'S FIND A WAY

02:25:30.722 --> 02:25:33.892 region:rollup2
TO BALANCE THAT BETWEEN ALL OF

02:25:32.224 --> 02:25:34.492 region:rollup2
OUR INTERESTS.

02:25:33.892 --> 02:25:35.393 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA TRYING

02:25:34.492 --> 02:25:37.262 region:rollup2
TO.

02:25:35.393 --> 02:25:38.530 region:rollup2
NOW WITH OUR INTERESTS.

ALWAYS BEEN PUBLIC SAFETY FIRST

02:25:38.530 --> 02:25:43.768 region:rollup2
AND FOREMOST.

02:25:40.298 --> 02:25:45.370 region:rollup2
SO QUICKLY CANADA I.

02:25:43.768 --> 02:25:46.771 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HAVE OUT NOW AND AND?

02:25:45.370 --> 02:25:48.673 region:rollup2
THEN I'LL TRY AND DRAW A LINE TO

02:25:46.771 --> 02:25:49.975 region:rollup2
WEAR COULD GO IN THE FUTURE YOU

02:25:48.673 --> 02:25:52.177 region:rollup2
KNOW FIRST THAT IS THE FIRST.

02:25:49.975 --> 02:25:53.478 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SAFETY BROADBAND NETWORK

02:25:52.177 --> 02:25:56.281 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING NATIONWIDE

02:25:53.478 --> 02:25:57.616 region:rollup2
IT'S CAN BE A NETWORK SOLELY A.

02:25:56.281 --> 02:25:59.618 region:rollup2
THE SOLE PURPOSE IS FOR LAW

02:25:57.616 --> 02:26:01.753 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT TO HAVE.

02:25:59.618 --> 02:26:02.887 region:rollup2
FAST ACCESS TO INTERNET SERVICES

02:26:01.753 --> 02:26:04.789 region:rollup2
IN REMOTE AREAS.

02:26:02.887 --> 02:26:05.390 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA JUST OPTED IN SO

02:26:04.789 --> 02:26:07.225 region:rollup2
WILL BE DEVELOPING IN HERE IN

02:26:05.390 --> 02:26:09.394 region:rollup2
THE STATE. AYE WE WANT THE FIGHT

02:26:07.225 --> 02:26:09.694 region:rollup2
FOR PRIORITY USE OF THE AIRWAVES

02:26:09.394 --> 02:26:11.062 region:rollup2
WITH OTHER.

02:26:09.694 --> 02:26:12.564 region:rollup2
.

02:26:11.062 --> 02:26:14.1000 region:rollup2
PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE WHO ELSE.

02:26:12.564 --> 02:26:16.301 region:rollup2
I'M.

02:26:14.1000 --> 02:26:17.435 region:rollup2
COULD BE INTERFERING SO THAT'S

02:26:16.301 --> 02:26:19.037 region:rollup2
CAN BE A GREAT THING.

02:26:17.435 --> 02:26:19.971 region:rollup2
ITS ITS MOBILE OVER CAN BE ABLE

02:26:19.037 --> 02:26:21.873 region:rollup2
TO CREATE HOTSPOTS IN SOME OF

02:26:19.971 --> 02:26:23.508 region:rollup2
THOSE RURAL AREAS OF CALIFORNIA

02:26:21.873 --> 02:26:25.143 region:rollup2
WHICH IS BEEN A HUGE ISSUE.

02:26:23.508 --> 02:26:26.311 region:rollup2
I'D SPECIALLY VIEW GET FAR UP

02:26:25.143 --> 02:26:28.213 region:rollup2
NORTH UP IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH

02:26:26.311 --> 02:26:29.748 region:rollup2
IS NOT A LOT OF SERVICES.

02:26:28.213 --> 02:26:31.349 region:rollup2
I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THAT YOU

KNOW.

02:26:31.349 --> 02:26:34.285 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ALWAYS RELIED

02:26:32.784 --> 02:26:36.454 region:rollup2
ON EVIDENCE AND DATA COLLECTION

02:26:34.285 --> 02:26:37.255 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE GOT REALLY GOOD AT

02:26:36.454 --> 02:26:38.790 region:rollup2
COLLECTING MORE AND MORE DATA

02:26:37.255 --> 02:26:40.058 region:rollup2
BUT. PARSING THROUGH HIS BECOME

02:26:38.790 --> 02:26:41.159 region:rollup2
MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT THE MORE

02:26:40.058 --> 02:26:43.161 region:rollup2
WE COLLECT.

02:26:41.159 --> 02:26:44.929 region:rollup2
I MEAN THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS

02:26:43.161 --> 02:26:46.164 region:rollup2
OF HOURS OF BODY CAM FOOTAGE.

02:26:44.929 --> 02:26:47.766 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF DATA POINTS ON.

02:26:46.164 --> 02:26:48.933 region:rollup2
.

02:26:47.766 --> 02:26:50.602 region:rollup2
FOR INVESTIGATIONS AND AND WHAT

NOT.

02:26:50.602 --> 02:26:53.438 region:rollup2
IT TAKES HOURS AND HOURS MAN

02:26:52.103 --> 02:26:54.773 region:rollup2
HOURS TO GO THROUGH COME THROUGH

02:26:53.438 --> 02:26:56.274 region:rollup2
AND FIND CONNECTIONS AND PUT

02:26:54.773 --> 02:26:58.376 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND A LOT OF TIMES WERE

02:26:56.274 --> 02:26:59.210 region:rollup2
OPERATING MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS.

02:26:58.376 --> 02:27:01.179 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE TO USE.

ANALYTICAL HELP FROM ARTIFICIAL

02:27:08.420 --> 02:27:11.289 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE TO GO THROUGH THAT

02:27:09.688 --> 02:27:12.590 region:rollup2
COME THROUGH THAT FIND PATTERNS

02:27:11.289 --> 02:27:14.059 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT IS GOING TO CONCERNS

02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:15.527 region:rollup2
ABOUT BIAS IN. WHAT THOSE

02:27:14.059 --> 02:27:17.095 region:rollup2
ANALYTICS ARE GONNA LOOK LIKE?

02:27:15.527 --> 02:27:18.797 region:rollup2

02:36:10.628 --> 02:36:16.200 region:rollup2

OKAY SO I. MADE MY HUMBLE

02:36:25.076 --> 02:36:28.980 region:rollup2
OPINION AS I SAID BEFORE

02:36:26.110 --> 02:36:30.514 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PASSED A LEAD.

02:36:28.980 --> 02:36:31.816 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE WE

02:36:30.514 --> 02:36:33.084 region:rollup2
BENEFIT FROM THE GROWTH OF

02:36:31.816 --> 02:36:34.418 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND

02:36:33.084 --> 02:36:36.354 region:rollup2
AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS PART OF THIS

02:36:34.418 --> 02:36:36.954 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGIES WE

02:36:36.354 --> 02:36:37.989 region:rollup2
CREATE HERE SPREAD AROUND THE

02:36:36.954 --> 02:36:39.624 region:rollup2
WORLD.

02:36:37.989 --> 02:36:41.559 region:rollup2
PARTIALLY BASED ON OPEN SOURCE

02:36:39.624 --> 02:36:43.861 region:rollup2
AND WE BEAR SOME RESPONSIBILITY.

02:36:41.559 --> 02:36:44.829 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW IT OF PANS OUT NOT

02:36:43.861 --> 02:36:47.131 region:rollup2
JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT GLOBALLY.

02:36:44.829 --> 02:36:48.499 region:rollup2
.

02:36:47.131 --> 02:36:49.967 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO.

02:36:48.499 --> 02:36:51.769 region:rollup2
GET OUR ARMS AROUND.

02:36:49.967 --> 02:36:53.204 region:rollup2
WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE WE

02:36:51.769 --> 02:36:54.305 region:rollup2
NEED TO STUDY THE PROBLEMS MUCH

02:36:53.204 --> 02:36:55.640 region:rollup2
MORE CAREFULLY?

02:36:54.305 --> 02:36:58.009 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE LOOKING AT THE IMPACT

02:36:55.640 --> 02:37:00.344 region:rollup2
ON JOBS WE SINCERELY DON'T KNOW

02:36:58.009 --> 02:37:01.612 region:rollup2
TODAY WHAT THE JOBS OF THE

02:37:00.344 --> 02:37:03.514 region:rollup2
FUTURE ARE GOING TO BE.

02:37:01.612 --> 02:37:04.882 region:rollup2
WE HAVE LOTS OF CONSULTANCY

02:37:03.514 --> 02:37:06.717 region:rollup2
REPORTS THAT TELL US WHAT SOME

02:37:04.882 --> 02:37:07.752 region:rollup2
OF THE JOBS JOB CATEGORIES COULD

02:37:06.717 --> 02:37:09.320 region:rollup2
BE IN THE FUTURE BUT FRANKLY

02:37:07.752 --> 02:37:11.656 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE NOT NECESSARILY ONE

02:37:09.320 --> 02:37:13.190 region:rollup2
FOUR ONE. TEMPLATE JOBS THESE

02:37:11.656 --> 02:37:14.825 region:rollup2
ARE THOUGHTFUL.

02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:17.228 region:rollup2
PROVOCATIONS TO HELP US THINK

02:37:14.825 --> 02:37:18.562 region:rollup2
ABOUT SOME NEW FACETS OF JOBS SO

02:37:17.228 --> 02:37:20.231 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD

02:37:18.562 --> 02:37:21.799 region:rollup2
DO. IS TO ENGAGE IN A PUBLIC

02:37:20.231 --> 02:37:23.267 region:rollup2
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP.

02:37:21.799 --> 02:37:25.903 region:rollup2
HELP US UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT

02:37:23.267 --> 02:37:27.905 region:rollup2
TYPES OF JOB SKILLS AND TASKS

02:37:25.903 --> 02:37:28.973 region:rollup2
COULD BE EMERGING.

02:37:27.905 --> 02:37:30.608 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND THIS PUBLIC PRIVATE

02:37:28.973 --> 02:37:31.742 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP SHOULD CONSIST OF

02:37:30.608 --> 02:37:33.344 region:rollup2
NOTCHES BUSINESS PEOPLE AND

02:37:31.742 --> 02:37:34.245 region:rollup2
ENGINEERS BUT FRANKLY AND

02:37:33.344 --> 02:37:36.080 region:rollup2
APOLOGISTS

02:37:34.245 --> 02:37:37.782 region:rollup2
SOCIOLOGISTS.

02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:40.051 region:rollup2
DESIGN PROFESSIONALS WHO

02:37:37.782 --> 02:37:41.385 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND ETHNIC GRAPHICS

02:37:40.051 --> 02:37:42.820 region:rollup2
HE COULD HAVE WHO CAN HELP US

02:37:41.385 --> 02:37:44.221 region:rollup2
EXERCISE SOME FORESIGHT ON THE

02:37:42.820 --> 02:37:46.057 region:rollup2
JOBS OF THE FUTURE.

02:37:44.221 --> 02:37:48.392 region:rollup2
.

02:37:46.057 --> 02:37:49.760 region:rollup2
I EIGHT TAKE A NOTE OF THE

02:37:48.392 --> 02:37:50.394 region:rollup2
COMMENT THAT WE HEARD FROM THE

02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:52.830 region:rollup2
THE GENTLEMAN.

02:37:50.394 --> 02:37:53.331 region:rollup2
FROM THE LABOR UNION.

02:37:52.830 --> 02:37:54.632 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:37:53.331 --> 02:37:56.334 region:rollup2
RETRAINING SCHEMES HAVE BEEN

02:37:54.632 --> 02:37:57.368 region:rollup2
FAULTY.

02:37:56.334 --> 02:37:59.270 region:rollup2
ARE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN A SUCCESS

02:37:57.368 --> 02:37:59.837 region:rollup2
WAS THEY SHOULD BE AND I WOULD

02:37:59.270 --> 02:38:00.938 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY CONCUR THAT IF IT

02:37:59.837 --> 02:38:02.640 region:rollup2
TAKES.

02:38:00.938 --> 02:38:03.975 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS TO RETRAIN FOR A NEW

02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:04.709 region:rollup2
JOB THAT MIGHT FRANKLY BE

02:38:03.975 --> 02:38:06.444 region:rollup2
OBSOLETE BY THE TIME THE

02:38:04.709 --> 02:38:08.379 region:rollup2
TRAINING ENDS.

02:38:06.444 --> 02:38:10.614 region:rollup2
AND THEN NOT BE MATCH FOR JOBS

02:38:08.379 --> 02:38:12.984 region:rollup2
IS A NON SEQUITUR.

02:38:10.614 --> 02:38:15.019 region:rollup2
SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THIS

02:38:12.984 --> 02:38:16.587 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS ON A PUBLIC

02:38:15.019 --> 02:38:18.089 region:rollup2
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP PLATFORM.

02:38:16.587 --> 02:38:19.623 region:rollup2
THAT WE COULD ADD IS ACTUAL JOB

02:38:18.089 --> 02:38:20.191 region:rollup2
MATCHING.

02:38:19.623 --> 02:38:21.826 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING THIS ALREADY ON

02:38:20.191 --> 02:38:23.561 region:rollup2
LINE.

02:38:21.826 --> 02:38:24.462 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT IDEAL IT'S NOT

02:38:23.561 --> 02:38:26.263 region:rollup2
PERFECT.

02:38:24.462 --> 02:38:28.632 region:rollup2
BUT THERE IS REALLY NO REASON

02:38:26.263 --> 02:38:30.134 region:rollup2
WHY WE COULDN'T PAIR INSIGHTS ON

02:38:28.632 --> 02:38:31.602 region:rollup2
THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE WITH SOME

02:38:30.134 --> 02:38:34.472 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE SYSTEMS FOR

02:38:31.602 --> 02:38:36.574 region:rollup2
CORPORATIONS. ARE. AND FOR

02:38:34.472 --> 02:38:38.376 region:rollup2
ACADEMICS TO JOINTLY DECIDE AND

02:38:36.574 --> 02:38:39.910 region:rollup2
DESIGN THESE JOBS AND THEN PLACE

02:38:38.376 --> 02:38:41.145 region:rollup2
PEOPLE INTO THEM.

02:38:39.910 --> 02:38:42.713 region:rollup2
RIGHT WE DO THIS ALREADY IN

02:38:41.145 --> 02:38:45.182 region:rollup2
OTHER AREAS OF LIFE.

02:38:42.713 --> 02:38:46.751 region:rollup2
WITNESS YOU KNOW MATCH DOT COM A

02:38:45.182 --> 02:38:48.419 region:rollup2
PARTNER SEARCH AT SUCH A THAT

02:38:46.751 --> 02:38:49.820 region:rollup2
WHY WOULD WOULD BE SO DIFFICULT

02:38:48.419 --> 02:38:51.655 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE OUT HOW SUITABLE

02:38:49.820 --> 02:38:54.191 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY IS FOR AN EXISTING. OR

02:38:51.655 --> 02:38:54.525 region:rollup2
NEW JOB PROFILE US THAT'S

02:38:54.191 --> 02:38:55.960 region:rollup2
ANOTHER IDEA.

02:38:54.525 --> 02:38:56.827 region:rollup2
.

02:38:55.960 --> 02:39:00.131 region:rollup2
THE.

02:38:56.827 --> 02:39:01.132 region:rollup2
THE KEY ELEMENT OF GETTING THE

02:39:00.131 --> 02:39:02.366 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SIDES TO WORK TOGETHER

02:39:01.132 --> 02:39:04.702 region:rollup2
OF COURSE AS EVERYWHERE ELSE IN

02:39:02.366 --> 02:39:06.070 region:rollup2
LIFE IS INCENTIVES.

02:39:04.702 --> 02:39:07.371 region:rollup2
SO HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE

02:39:06.070 --> 02:39:08.305 region:rollup2
CORPORATIONS TO.

02:39:07.371 --> 02:39:10.674 region:rollup2
TO.

02:39:08.305 --> 02:39:11.776 region:rollup2
PLAY THEIR PART IN THIS.

02:39:10.674 --> 02:39:13.511 region:rollup2
A NUMBER ONE OF COURSE

02:39:11.776 --> 02:39:14.678 region:rollup2
STRATEGICALLY NO CORPORATE

02:39:13.511 --> 02:39:17.048 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE.

02:39:14.678 --> 02:39:18.616 region:rollup2
IS INTERESTED IN HAVING PUBLIC

02:39:17.048 --> 02:39:20.284 region:rollup2
OPINION TURNED AGAINST THEM WHEN

02:39:18.616 --> 02:39:22.386 region:rollup2
JOBS GET LOST WHEN PEOPLE HAVE

02:39:20.284 --> 02:39:23.654 region:rollup2
TO LAY OFF BE LAID OFF SO THAT'S

02:39:22.386 --> 02:39:24.955 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE BUT WE NEED TO GET

02:39:23.654 --> 02:39:26.223 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE CONCRETE AND HANDS ON

02:39:24.955 --> 02:39:27.358 region:rollup2
TACTICAL ABOUT THIS IN MY HUMBLE

02:39:26.223 --> 02:39:29.527 region:rollup2
OPINION.

02:39:27.358 --> 02:39:31.228 region:rollup2
THE I. WITHOUT WANTING TO BECOME

02:39:29.527 --> 02:39:32.930 region:rollup2
TOO POLITICAL HERE BUT THE

02:39:31.228 --> 02:39:34.899 region:rollup2
RECENT.

02:39:32.930 --> 02:39:37.234 region:rollup2
TAX BILL THAT PASSED.

02:39:34.899 --> 02:39:38.836 region:rollup2
DOES FRANKLY NOTHING TO ENSURE

02:39:37.234 --> 02:39:40.304 region:rollup2
THAT CORPORATION SPEND SOME OF

02:39:38.836 --> 02:39:41.639 region:rollup2
THAT MONEY TO DESIGN THE JOBS OF

02:39:40.304 --> 02:39:42.073 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE AND PUT PEOPLE INTO

02:39:41.639 --> 02:39:42.973 region:rollup2
THEM THERE ARE SOME

02:39:42.073 --> 02:39:44.208 region:rollup2
CORPORATIONS.

02:39:42.973 --> 02:39:45.443 region:rollup2
THAT ARE GOOD AT THINKING ABOUT

02:39:44.208 --> 02:39:47.878 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE.

02:39:45.443 --> 02:39:49.780 region:rollup2
BUT MOST ARE FRANKLY MUCH TOO

02:39:47.878 --> 02:39:51.549 region:rollup2
PREOCCUPIED WITH SHORTER TERM

02:39:49.780 --> 02:39:53.384 region:rollup2
GOALS AND RIGHTLY SO.

02:39:51.549 --> 02:39:55.186 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO DEVOTE MUCH ENERGY

02:39:53.384 --> 02:39:57.922 region:rollup2
AND RESOURCES TO THESE JOB

02:39:55.186 --> 02:39:58.722 region:rollup2
DESIGNS THAT MAY NOT A BECOME

02:39:57.922 --> 02:40:01.225 region:rollup2
RELEVANT.

02:39:58.722 --> 02:40:03.260 region:rollup2
NEXT YEAR OR THE YEAR AFTER BUT

02:40:01.225 --> 02:40:05.529 region:rollup2
RATHER FIVE SIX SEVEN YEARS OUT

02:40:03.260 --> 02:40:07.198 region:rollup2
SO WHY NOT DEVELOP A TAX

02:40:05.529 --> 02:40:08.232 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE SCHEME.

02:40:07.198 --> 02:40:10.134 region:rollup2
THAT SAYS HERE ARE SOME

02:40:08.232 --> 02:40:11.702 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL TAX CREDITS OR OTHER

02:40:10.134 --> 02:40:14.138 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL INCENTIVES.

02:40:11.702 --> 02:40:15.706 region:rollup2
THAT WILL KICK IN WHEN YOU

02:40:14.138 --> 02:40:18.075 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN THESE JOB DESIGN

02:40:15.706 --> 02:40:20.010 region:rollup2
PLATFORMS AND WHEN YOU HELP US

02:40:18.075 --> 02:40:21.278 region:rollup2
PUT PEOPLE INTO THOSE JOBS.

02:40:20.010 --> 02:40:22.046 region:rollup2
S. SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE THAT

02:40:21.278 --> 02:40:24.014 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ANOTHER.

02:40:22.046 --> 02:40:24.281 region:rollup2
SUGGESTION HERE TO GET QUITE

02:40:24.014 --> 02:40:25.249 region:rollup2
CONCRETE.

02:40:24.281 --> 02:40:27.485 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS.

02:40:25.249 --> 02:40:30.121 region:rollup2
NEXT.

02:40:27.485 --> 02:40:31.889 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY THAT WE HAVE TO.

02:40:30.121 --> 02:40:33.424 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT DATA WHICH IS

02:40:31.889 --> 02:40:34.959 region:rollup2
REALLY THE CURRENCY OF POWER.

02:40:33.424 --> 02:40:35.392 region:rollup2
.

02:40:34.959 --> 02:40:37.628 region:rollup2
A GETS.

02:40:35.392 --> 02:40:38.696 region:rollup2
DEMOCRATIZED.

02:40:37.628 --> 02:40:39.363 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WE

02:40:38.696 --> 02:40:40.965 region:rollup2
CAN DO.

02:40:39.363 --> 02:40:42.032 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE IS WE HAVE TO MAKE

02:40:40.965 --> 02:40:43.634 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE HAVE OPEN DATA

02:40:42.032 --> 02:40:44.435 region:rollup2
PLATFORMS.

02:40:43.634 --> 02:40:47.371 region:rollup2
WHERE?

02:40:44.435 --> 02:40:49.006 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS CAN CHOOSE TO DEPOSIT

02:40:47.371 --> 02:40:50.541 region:rollup2
THEIR DATA POSSIBLY BECOME

02:40:49.006 --> 02:40:51.642 region:rollup2
CONCEITED BY THOSE WHO WANT TO

02:40:50.541 --> 02:40:52.776 region:rollup2
MAKE USE OF THE DATA.

02:40:51.642 --> 02:40:55.079 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT IS

02:40:52.776 --> 02:40:56.247 region:rollup2
UNCONSCIONABLE TO HAVE SIX LARGE

02:40:55.079 --> 02:40:57.815 region:rollup2
CORPORATIONS AROUND THE WORLD

02:40:56.247 --> 02:40:59.483 region:rollup2
OWN ALL THE DATA.

02:40:57.815 --> 02:41:00.384 region:rollup2
SO WE WE HAVE TO PUT SOME

02:40:59.483 --> 02:41:01.785 region:rollup2
THINKING INTO OPEN DATA

02:41:00.384 --> 02:41:03.220 region:rollup2
PLATFORMS.

02:41:01.785 --> 02:41:05.322 region:rollup2
EQUALLY THEN WE HAVE TO THINK

02:41:03.220 --> 02:41:07.391 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW TO GIVE DATA OWNERSHIP

02:41:05.322 --> 02:41:09.026 region:rollup2
TO INDIVIDUALS.

02:41:07.391 --> 02:41:10.361 region:rollup2
I MAY WANT TO GIVE UP MY DATA IN

02:41:09.026 --> 02:41:12.863 region:rollup2
ORDER TO GET CONVENIENCE'S

02:41:10.361 --> 02:41:14.798 region:rollup2
SERVICES EXPERIENCES PRODUCTS.

02:41:12.863 --> 02:41:16.367 region:rollup2
BOB BUT I SHOULD HAVE OWNERSHIP

02:41:14.798 --> 02:41:17.501 region:rollup2
OVER THAT AND I SHOULD DETERMINE

02:41:16.367 --> 02:41:19.837 region:rollup2
WHETHER AT ANY GIVEN POINT IN

02:41:17.501 --> 02:41:20.437 region:rollup2
TIME I WANT TO GIVE UP OWNERSHIP

02:41:19.837 --> 02:41:21.405 region:rollup2
OVER THAT DATA I WANT TO GIVE

02:41:20.437 --> 02:41:22.940 region:rollup2
UP.

02:41:21.405 --> 02:41:24.708 region:rollup2
PRIVACY.

02:41:22.940 --> 02:41:26.644 region:rollup2
S. MAYBE EVEN AGENCY

02:41:24.708 --> 02:41:29.113 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS A DEAL THAT MOST OF

02:41:26.644 --> 02:41:30.314 region:rollup2
US A CAN MAKE I DO THINK WE HAVE

02:41:29.113 --> 02:41:32.349 region:rollup2
TO BE VERY PROTECTIVE OF

02:41:30.314 --> 02:41:34.318 region:rollup2
CHILDREN IN THIS AREA. AND WITH

02:41:32.349 --> 02:41:35.986 region:rollup2
CHILDREN I WOULD SAY ANYBODY

02:41:34.318 --> 02:41:36.587 region:rollup2
UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN.

02:41:35.986 --> 02:41:39.023 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

02:41:36.587 --> 02:41:40.491 region:rollup2
MANY. MANY YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE

02:41:39.023 --> 02:41:41.592 region:rollup2
NOT HAD ENOUGH LIFE EXPERIENCE

02:41:40.491 --> 02:41:43.827 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT CAN HAPPEN

02:41:41.592 --> 02:41:45.095 region:rollup2
WHEN DATA GETS MIS USE.

02:41:43.827 --> 02:41:46.597 region:rollup2
I WILL TELL YOU BEING A

02:41:45.095 --> 02:41:48.132 region:rollup2
PROFESSOR IN A TEACHER OF LOTS

02:41:46.597 --> 02:41:49.333 region:rollup2
OF YOUNG PEOPLE MILLENNIALS IN

02:41:48.132 --> 02:41:51.535 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR.

02:41:49.333 --> 02:41:53.637 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ARE VERY AWARE OF THIS

02:41:51.535 --> 02:41:55.906 region:rollup2
AND THAT THEY ARE VERY VESTED IN

02:41:53.637 --> 02:41:57.341 region:rollup2
A SOLUTION IN FACT I JUST. GOT

02:41:55.906 --> 02:41:58.842 region:rollup2
DONE TEACHING A COURSE OF

02:41:57.341 --> 02:42:00.477 region:rollup2
BUSINESS IN GLOBAL SOCIETY IN

02:41:58.842 --> 02:42:02.580 region:rollup2
WHICH STUDENTS WERE ASKED TO

02:42:00.477 --> 02:42:04.548 region:rollup2
DESIGN ARE A AYE SYSTEMS THAT

02:42:02.580 --> 02:42:06.317 region:rollup2
COULD MAKE SOCIETAL UP PROBLEMS

02:42:04.548 --> 02:42:08.719 region:rollup2
GO AWAY AND MAKE SOCIETAL

02:42:06.317 --> 02:42:10.287 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS MORE. ARE RESILIENT AND

02:42:08.719 --> 02:42:12.656 region:rollup2
ANTI FRAGILE AND.

02:42:10.287 --> 02:42:14.191 region:rollup2
THEY ARE INCREDIBLY MOTIVATED

02:42:12.656 --> 02:42:16.026 region:rollup2
TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION BUT

02:42:14.191 --> 02:42:17.361 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE TO TARGET THEIR

02:42:16.026 --> 02:42:19.163 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR NEEDS.

02:42:17.361 --> 02:42:20.164 region:rollup2
ARE SO THAT'S A THAT'S A STEP

02:42:19.163 --> 02:42:21.899 region:rollup2
NUMBER FOUR FIVE.

02:42:20.164 --> 02:42:24.034 region:rollup2
.

02:42:21.899 --> 02:42:25.603 region:rollup2
I THINK PRIVACY DOES WARRANT

02:42:24.034 --> 02:42:26.904 region:rollup2
SOME POLICY AND REGULATORY

02:42:25.603 --> 02:42:28.339 region:rollup2
APPROACH BUT I WOULD WARN

02:42:26.904 --> 02:42:30.174 region:rollup2
AGAINST.

02:42:28.339 --> 02:42:32.042 region:rollup2
JUST MIMICKING THE EUROPEAN

02:42:30.174 --> 02:42:33.544 region:rollup2
GENERAL DATA PROTECTION

02:42:32.042 --> 02:42:35.379 region:rollup2
DIRECTIVE AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE.

02:42:33.544 --> 02:42:37.948 region:rollup2
I DO BELIEVE THAT.

02:42:35.379 --> 02:42:39.283 region:rollup2
A MOST PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD

02:42:37.948 --> 02:42:41.318 region:rollup2
SHARE THE INTENT.

02:42:39.283 --> 02:42:41.819 region:rollup2
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IT IS TOO

02:42:41.318 --> 02:42:43.220 region:rollup2
BROAD AND IT WILL STIFLE

02:42:41.819 --> 02:42:44.088 region:rollup2
INNOVATION.

02:42:43.220 --> 02:42:45.623 region:rollup2
AND.

02:42:44.088 --> 02:42:46.357 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM OF COURSE WITH

02:42:45.623 --> 02:42:47.891 region:rollup2
EUROPE IS THAT IT IS VERY

02:42:46.357 --> 02:42:50.694 region:rollup2
PROTECTIVE.

02:42:47.891 --> 02:42:52.563 region:rollup2
AND VERY OF. HAVE SECURE FOR

02:42:50.694 --> 02:42:53.998 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS BUT IT LACKS DIGITAL

02:42:52.563 --> 02:42:55.599 region:rollup2
INNOVATION POWER.

02:42:53.998 --> 02:42:57.001 region:rollup2
THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE AND

02:42:55.599 --> 02:42:58.102 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO MAINTAIN SOME WE DO

02:42:57.001 --> 02:42:59.803 region:rollup2
NEED TO PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER

02:42:58.102 --> 02:43:01.272 region:rollup2
WITH THE EUROPEANS.

02:42:59.803 --> 02:43:02.606 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN IN A BETTER

02:43:01.272 --> 02:43:05.009 region:rollup2
WAY.

02:43:02.606 --> 02:43:06.477 region:rollup2
I I WOULD HIGHLIGHTS HERE THAT

02:43:05.009 --> 02:43:08.345 region:rollup2
GERMANY IN THE NORDIC COUNTRIES

02:43:06.477 --> 02:43:10.080 region:rollup2
ARE A STEP AHEAD WHEN IT COMES

02:43:08.345 --> 02:43:11.548 region:rollup2
TO INTEGRATION OF LABOR AND

02:43:10.080 --> 02:43:13.217 region:rollup2
DIGITAL TOOLS LIKE ARTIFICIAL

02:43:11.548 --> 02:43:14.585 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE AND ROBOTICS. AND I

02:43:13.217 --> 02:43:15.352 region:rollup2
WOULD URGE US TO STRIKE THE

02:43:14.585 --> 02:43:16.220 region:rollup2
BRIDGE.

02:43:15.352 --> 02:43:17.588 region:rollup2
AND.

02:43:16.220 --> 02:43:20.357 region:rollup2
DEVELOP A JOINT INITIATIVE TO

02:43:17.588 --> 02:43:22.026 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT. HOW WE CAN JOINTLY

02:43:20.357 --> 02:43:24.261 region:rollup2
FACILITATE LABOR AND WORK IN

02:43:22.026 --> 02:43:26.096 region:rollup2
GENERAL? AS I SAID BEFORE I'M

02:43:24.261 --> 02:43:27.731 region:rollup2
PART OF A BERKELEY INITIATIVE

02:43:26.096 --> 02:43:29.500 region:rollup2
CALLED WORKING LEARNING EARNING.

02:43:27.731 --> 02:43:30.300 region:rollup2
IN THE ERA OF INTELLIGENT TOOLS

02:43:29.500 --> 02:43:32.770 region:rollup2
AND SYSTEMS.

02:43:30.300 --> 02:43:34.238 region:rollup2
WAITS FOR SHORT LONG LONG TITLE.

02:43:32.770 --> 02:43:35.939 region:rollup2
INCOME BUT I THINK VERY

02:43:34.238 --> 02:43:37.775 region:rollup2
MEANINGFUL WORK.

02:43:35.939 --> 02:43:39.376 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT THERE

02:43:37.775 --> 02:43:41.845 region:rollup2
THERE IS A NEW ERA DAWNING HERE

02:43:39.376 --> 02:43:43.947 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THAT THE ERA OF THE.

02:43:41.845 --> 02:43:45.783 region:rollup2
LIFETIME JOB. AT THAT KEEPS YOU

02:43:43.947 --> 02:43:46.216 region:rollup2
EMPLOYED FOR FORTY HOURS PLUS A

02:43:45.783 --> 02:43:48.519 region:rollup2
WEEK.

02:43:46.216 --> 02:43:49.987 region:rollup2
IS ESSENTIALLY COMING TO AN END

02:43:48.519 --> 02:43:52.189 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT.

02:43:49.987 --> 02:43:53.090 region:rollup2
THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE

02:43:52.189 --> 02:43:53.524 region:rollup2
CONTRACTING AREA.

02:43:53.090 --> 02:43:54.925 region:rollup2
OUR JOBS ARE GETTING

02:43:53.524 --> 02:43:57.394 region:rollup2
DEFRAGMENTER. BY DIGITAL

02:43:54.925 --> 02:43:59.096 region:rollup2
PLATFORMS SO THEN HOW DO WE HOW

02:43:57.394 --> 02:44:00.931 region:rollup2
DO WE WORK THAT INVOLVEMENT HOW

02:43:59.096 --> 02:44:02.199 region:rollup2
TO LEARN HOW WE ARE. AND CREATE

02:44:00.931 --> 02:44:04.001 region:rollup2
ENOUGH STABILITY SO PEOPLE FEEL

02:44:02.199 --> 02:44:05.135 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE HAVING FAMILIES

02:44:04.001 --> 02:44:07.504 region:rollup2
ENGAGING IN PARTNERSHIPS BUYING

02:44:05.135 --> 02:44:09.973 region:rollup2
PROPERTY ALL THE THINGS THAT

02:44:07.504 --> 02:44:11.742 region:rollup2
THAT MAKE SOCIETY MORE STABLE

02:44:09.973 --> 02:44:12.743 region:rollup2
AND MORE WORTH WHILE LIVING IN.

02:44:11.742 --> 02:44:14.912 region:rollup2
NOT SO WERE SO.

02:44:12.743 --> 02:44:16.847 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY WE SHOULD DO SOME

02:44:14.912 --> 02:44:18.248 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONAL ARE PARTNERING AND

02:44:16.847 --> 02:44:20.417 region:rollup2
BEST PRACTICE SHARING THEIR.

02:44:18.248 --> 02:44:22.886 region:rollup2
LASTLY I WOULD MENTION TWO

02:44:20.417 --> 02:44:24.488 region:rollup2
THINGS I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE

02:44:22.886 --> 02:44:25.422 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS PUBLIC.

02:44:24.488 --> 02:44:26.790 region:rollup2
LIKE I SAID BEFORE I DON'T THINK

02:44:25.422 --> 02:44:28.459 region:rollup2
WE CAN LEAVE IT TO JUST

02:44:26.790 --> 02:44:30.127 region:rollup2
ENTREPRENEURS AND SCIENTISTS.

02:44:28.459 --> 02:44:30.661 region:rollup2
AND I WORK WITH BOTH

02:44:30.127 --> 02:44:32.162 region:rollup2
AND.

02:44:30.661 --> 02:44:33.864 region:rollup2
THESE A VERY CONSCIENTIOUS

02:44:32.162 --> 02:44:36.266 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAVE THE BEST INTENTIONS

02:44:33.864 --> 02:44:37.201 region:rollup2
IN FACT AS A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE

02:44:36.266 --> 02:44:38.168 region:rollup2
SAYS WHEN YOU GO INTO A COMPUTER

02:44:37.201 --> 02:44:40.003 region:rollup2
SCIENCE.

02:44:38.168 --> 02:44:42.439 region:rollup2
TODAY OTHERS ALMOST MORE

02:44:40.003 --> 02:44:43.474 region:rollup2
INTEREST IN A STUDYING OVERALL

02:44:42.439 --> 02:44:45.242 region:rollup2
SOCIAL JUSTICE.

02:44:43.474 --> 02:44:46.210 region:rollup2
THAN THERE IS IN STUDYING HOW

02:44:45.242 --> 02:44:47.244 region:rollup2
TO CODE.

02:44:46.210 --> 02:44:48.645 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S BECAUSE.

02:44:47.244 --> 02:44:50.347 region:rollup2
MOST COMPUTER SCIENTISTS ARE

02:44:48.645 --> 02:44:51.415 region:rollup2
BECOMING VERY AWARE THAT THIS IS

02:44:50.347 --> 02:44:52.316 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT THEY

02:44:51.415 --> 02:44:52.950 region:rollup2
DON'T WANNA BE PART OF THE

02:44:52.316 --> 02:44:54.218 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THEY WANT TO BE PART OF

02:44:52.950 --> 02:44:54.852 region:rollup2
THE CITY.

02:44:54.218 --> 02:44:56.387 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

02:44:54.852 --> 02:44:58.622 region:rollup2
AND SO.

02:44:56.387 --> 02:45:00.424 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS PUBLIC

02:44:58.622 --> 02:45:02.326 region:rollup2
ENGAGE THE PUBLIC GET THE

02:45:00.424 --> 02:45:03.227 region:rollup2
COMPUTER SCIENTISTS.

02:45:02.326 --> 02:45:04.128 region:rollup2
THE.

02:45:03.227 --> 02:45:06.096 region:rollup2
PHILOSOPHERS THE

02:45:04.128 --> 02:45:06.697 region:rollup2
ANTHROPOLOGISTS

02:45:06.096 --> 02:45:09.266 region:rollup2
GET BUSINESS PEOPLE

02:45:06.697 --> 02:45:10.934 region:rollup2
ENTREPRENEURS POLICYMAKERS AND

02:45:09.266 --> 02:45:12.736 region:rollup2
THE MEDIA TOGETHER IN ONE ROOM.

02:45:10.934 --> 02:45:14.972 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE IS ROOM FOR A

02:45:12.736 --> 02:45:16.373 region:rollup2
MULTI STAKEHOLDER QUOTE UNQUOTE

02:45:14.972 --> 02:45:18.208 region:rollup2
CONGRESS. WE SORT OF.

02:45:16.373 --> 02:45:20.244 region:rollup2
TENTATIVELY DUBBED IT A

02:45:18.208 --> 02:45:21.078 region:rollup2
CAMBRIAN CONGRESS WHY CAMBRIAN

02:45:20.244 --> 02:45:22.379 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE CAMBRIAN

02:45:21.078 --> 02:45:24.281 region:rollup2
EXPLOSION OF LIFE.

02:45:22.379 --> 02:45:25.682 region:rollup2
I AM A TECHNO OPTIMIST I DO

02:45:24.281 --> 02:45:27.417 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF

02:45:25.682 --> 02:45:28.685 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY DAWNING HERE BUT WE

02:45:27.417 --> 02:45:30.220 region:rollup2
CAN'T HARNESS IT WITHOUT A

02:45:28.685 --> 02:45:33.924 region:rollup2
PUBLIC DIALOGUE SO WE HAVE TO BE

02:45:30.220 --> 02:45:35.559 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATORY. IDEALLY MAYBE IN

02:45:33.924 --> 02:45:37.094 region:rollup2
A STAGE TO EVEN CROSS BORDER.

02:45:35.559 --> 02:45:38.395 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT TO

02:45:37.094 --> 02:45:39.763 region:rollup2
HAPPEN IN CHINA AND ELSEWHERE

02:45:38.395 --> 02:45:41.465 region:rollup2
AROUND THE WORLD COME HERE. AND

02:45:39.763 --> 02:45:44.134 region:rollup2
VICE VERSA.

02:45:41.465 --> 02:45:45.636 region:rollup2
AND THAT KIND OF CONGRESS

02:45:44.134 --> 02:45:47.938 region:rollup2
SHOULD DEVELOP SOME KIND OF.

02:45:45.636 --> 02:45:50.040 region:rollup2
FORUM THAT DISCUSSES A CODE OF

02:45:47.938 --> 02:45:51.375 region:rollup2
CONDUCT.

02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:53.577 region:rollup2
AND THESE WILL NECESSARILY BE

02:45:51.375 --> 02:45:55.279 region:rollup2
VERY HIGH LEVEL RULES.

02:45:53.577 --> 02:45:56.847 region:rollup2
AND THESE WILL BE VOLUNTARY.

02:45:55.279 --> 02:45:58.982 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK PREMIUM.

02:45:56.847 --> 02:46:00.451 region:rollup2
BRAND EQUITY AS IT WERE AND

02:45:58.982 --> 02:46:02.286 region:rollup2
PREMIUM RELATIONSHIP EQUITY WILL

02:46:00.451 --> 02:46:03.854 region:rollup2
BE GIVEN TO THOSE PEOPLE IN

02:46:02.286 --> 02:46:05.622 region:rollup2
THOSE CORPORATIONS WHO SIGNED ON

02:46:03.854 --> 02:46:08.058 region:rollup2
TO THIS KIND OF DIALOGUE INTO

02:46:05.622 --> 02:46:09.159 region:rollup2
THIS KIND OF. A CODE OF CONDUCT.

02:46:08.058 --> 02:46:10.928 region:rollup2
THAT LEAVES OUT SOME GENERAL

02:46:09.159 --> 02:46:12.296 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLES ON WHAT KIND OF

02:46:10.928 --> 02:46:13.931 region:rollup2
VALUES WE ALL SHARE.

02:46:12.296 --> 02:46:15.065 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT WILL BE WE DON'T KNOW

02:46:13.931 --> 02:46:16.400 region:rollup2
AND THE DIALOGUE WILL SURFACE

02:46:15.065 --> 02:46:18.368 region:rollup2
THAT BUT I THINK JUST HAVING THE

02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:20.103 region:rollup2
DIALOGUE WILL BE IMMENSELY

02:46:18.368 --> 02:46:21.138 region:rollup2
POWERFUL? I'D LIKE TO CLOSE

02:46:20.103 --> 02:46:23.040 region:rollup2
MAYBE WITH THE COMMENT ON

02:46:21.138 --> 02:46:25.742 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

02:46:23.040 --> 02:46:27.177 region:rollup2
I THINK PART OF MY.

02:46:25.742 --> 02:46:30.113 region:rollup2
COMMENTS ON A.

02:46:27.177 --> 02:46:33.050 region:rollup2
JOBS OF THE FUTURE THINK TANK

02:46:30.113 --> 02:46:34.685 region:rollup2
DASH JOB BROKERING PLATFORM IDEA

02:46:33.050 --> 02:46:36.687 region:rollup2
IS THE THE.

02:46:34.685 --> 02:46:38.088 region:rollup2
THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE THAT

02:46:36.687 --> 02:46:39.957 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO NOW.

02:46:38.088 --> 02:46:42.626 region:rollup2
START TO COACH.

02:46:39.957 --> 02:46:44.361 region:rollup2
FRANKLY ALL OF US BUT MOSTLY.

02:46:42.626 --> 02:46:46.430 region:rollup2
OR MOST IMPORTANTLY THOSE

02:46:44.361 --> 02:46:48.599 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT ARE THREATENED MORE

02:46:46.430 --> 02:46:50.501 region:rollup2
NEAR TERM. IN A COMBINATION OF

02:46:48.599 --> 02:46:53.203 region:rollup2
HARD AND SOFT SKILLS.

02:46:50.501 --> 02:46:54.838 region:rollup2
SO DATA SIGNS IS PREEMINENTLY

02:46:53.203 --> 02:46:56.573 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND I'M A BIG FAN OUT

02:46:54.838 --> 02:46:58.308 region:rollup2
OF OF MAKING THIS.

02:46:56.573 --> 02:47:00.043 region:rollup2
ACHE REQUIREMENTS TO A

02:46:58.308 --> 02:47:01.645 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA STATE SCHOOLS.

02:47:00.043 --> 02:47:03.480 region:rollup2
AND.

02:47:01.645 --> 02:47:05.249 region:rollup2
AND THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN.

02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:07.017 region:rollup2
HOWEVER BASIC CODING SKILLS

02:47:05.249 --> 02:47:08.619 region:rollup2
CAN'T BE THE GOAL.

02:47:07.017 --> 02:47:10.420 region:rollup2
FRANKLY I JUST GOT BACK FROM

02:47:08.619 --> 02:47:11.722 region:rollup2
INDIA AND IN INDIA MANY PEOPLE

02:47:10.420 --> 02:47:12.990 region:rollup2
ARE NOW AFRAID FOR THEIR THIRTY

02:47:11.722 --> 02:47:14.491 region:rollup2
MILLION CODERS.

02:47:12.990 --> 02:47:15.492 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT DEVELOPING

02:47:14.491 --> 02:47:16.960 region:rollup2
MACHINES THAT WILL DO BASIC

02:47:15.492 --> 02:47:17.594 region:rollup2
CODING THEMSELVES.

02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:19.396 region:rollup2
AND SO.

02:47:17.594 --> 02:47:20.764 region:rollup2
SO OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT TALKING

02:47:19.396 --> 02:47:23.200 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE SOPHISTICATED.

02:47:20.764 --> 02:47:24.067 region:rollup2
STANFORD OR BERKELEY PHD IN

02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:26.236 region:rollup2
COMPUTER SCIENCE WE'RE TALKING

02:47:24.067 --> 02:47:27.604 region:rollup2
ABOUT A LOWER ELEVEN CORE LOW

02:47:26.236 --> 02:47:28.772 region:rollup2
LEVEL CODING SKILLS IT'S NOT

02:47:27.604 --> 02:47:30.140 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:47:28.772 --> 02:47:31.642 region:rollup2
TODAY'S KIDS SHOULDN'T PUT THEIR

02:47:30.140 --> 02:47:33.410 region:rollup2
HANDS ON THE KEYBOARD TOOK TO

02:47:31.642 --> 02:47:34.311 region:rollup2
LEARN WHAT THAT'S LIKE BUT I

02:47:33.410 --> 02:47:35.746 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO

02:47:34.311 --> 02:47:36.713 region:rollup2
TEACH THEM HOW TO CRITICALLY

02:47:35.746 --> 02:47:39.216 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT WHAT.

02:47:36.713 --> 02:47:40.284 region:rollup2
DATA SCIENCE DOES.

02:47:39.216 --> 02:47:41.885 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT IS IN FACT REAL

02:47:40.284 --> 02:47:43.320 region:rollup2
SCIENCE.

02:47:41.885 --> 02:47:44.755 region:rollup2
OR WHETHER IT'S JUST ENGINEERING

02:47:43.320 --> 02:47:46.256 region:rollup2
OF SOLUTIONS THAT ARE DRIVEN BY

02:47:44.755 --> 02:47:48.358 region:rollup2
CERTAIN INCENTIVES.

02:47:46.256 --> 02:47:50.227 region:rollup2
AND TO DEVELOP CRITICAL

02:47:48.358 --> 02:47:50.761 region:rollup2
THINKING AND ANALYSIS SKILLS

02:47:50.227 --> 02:47:51.862 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO COMPUTING

02:47:50.761 --> 02:47:52.863 region:rollup2
POWER.

02:47:51.862 --> 02:47:54.398 region:rollup2
S. SUCH AS ARTIFICIAL

02:47:52.863 --> 02:47:55.999 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE

02:47:54.398 --> 02:47:59.136 region:rollup2
IN COMBINATION WITH THAT.

02:47:55.999 --> 02:48:00.437 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY CONVERSELY WE HAVE

02:47:59.136 --> 02:48:01.805 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT COMPUTER

02:48:00.437 --> 02:48:03.574 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS.

02:48:01.805 --> 02:48:05.275 region:rollup2
FRANKLY ALL OVER THE COUNTRY

02:48:03.574 --> 02:48:06.877 region:rollup2
BUT ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA GET

02:48:05.275 --> 02:48:08.845 region:rollup2
ETHICS TRAINING.

02:48:06.877 --> 02:48:09.446 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THAT MOST OF THEM

02:48:08.845 --> 02:48:10.247 region:rollup2
ALREADY FOR THIS AND THEY WANT

02:48:09.446 --> 02:48:13.216 region:rollup2
IT.

02:48:10.247 --> 02:48:15.686 region:rollup2
BY DE YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY.

02:48:13.216 --> 02:48:17.154 region:rollup2
ACROSS ACADEMIA SOME OF THE

02:48:15.686 --> 02:48:18.755 region:rollup2
STOVE PIPES AS IN MANY OTHER

02:48:17.154 --> 02:48:19.823 region:rollup2
AREAS IN LIFE DON'T TALK TO EACH

02:48:18.755 --> 02:48:20.691 region:rollup2
OTHER.

02:48:19.823 --> 02:48:22.793 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED TO GET THE

02:48:20.691 --> 02:48:26.229 region:rollup2
ANTHROPOLOGIST THE PHILOSOPHERS

02:48:22.793 --> 02:48:26.229 region:rollup2
DE ETHICS CALLERS.

02:48:26.296 --> 02:48:29.733 region:rollup2
SCIENTIST TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO

02:48:28.198 --> 02:48:31.368 region:rollup2
WE TALK TO EACH OTHER AND WHAT

02:48:29.733 --> 02:48:33.704 region:rollup2
KIND OF PRINCIPLES DO WE NEED TO

02:48:31.368 --> 02:48:34.838 region:rollup2
TEACH EACH OTHER FOR SOME JOINT

02:48:33.704 --> 02:48:36.840 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING.

02:48:34.838 --> 02:48:38.175 region:rollup2
OF THE FUTURE OF COMPUTING AND

02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:39.977 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S ALSO ETHICS DRIVEN

02:48:38.175 --> 02:48:40.877 region:rollup2
OR AT LEAST VALUES DRIVEN WHICH

02:48:39.977 --> 02:48:42.512 region:rollup2
SEEMS TO BE THE THE MORE NEUTRAL

02:48:40.877 --> 02:48:44.548 region:rollup2
TERM.

02:48:42.512 --> 02:48:46.083 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK IT'S BOTH IT'S

02:48:44.548 --> 02:48:48.051 region:rollup2
HARD AND SOFT ITS STATE OF

02:48:46.083 --> 02:48:49.586 region:rollup2
SCIENCE AND IT'S ETHICS AND IT'S

02:48:48.051 --> 02:48:51.355 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE ABOVE.

02:48:49.586 --> 02:48:53.557 region:rollup2
THE HUMAN BEING SHOULD NOT BE

02:48:51.355 --> 02:48:55.592 region:rollup2
COMPETING WITH THE COMPUTER SO

02:48:53.557 --> 02:48:57.094 region:rollup2
LET'S NOT JUST TEACH PEOPLE HOW

02:48:55.592 --> 02:48:57.961 region:rollup2
TO BE LIKE A COMPUTER.

02:48:57.094 --> 02:48:59.196 region:rollup2
LET'S TEACH THEM HOW TO

02:48:57.961 --> 02:49:00.831 region:rollup2
INTEGRATE WITH THE COMPUTER HOW

02:48:59.196 --> 02:49:01.965 region:rollup2
TO PARTNER WITH THE COMPUTER BUT

02:49:00.831 --> 02:49:03.200 region:rollup2
HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE FROM THE

02:49:01.965 --> 02:49:04.601 region:rollup2
COMPUTER.

02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:05.936 region:rollup2
AND PART OF WHAT MAKES ME

02:49:04.601 --> 02:49:07.804 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FROM A COMPUTER IS

02:49:05.936 --> 02:49:10.440 region:rollup2
THAT I DO HAVE.

02:49:07.804 --> 02:49:13.010 region:rollup2
THE EMOTING SKILLS THE EMPATHY

02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:14.645 region:rollup2
SKILLS THE IDEATION SKILLS THE

02:49:13.010 --> 02:49:16.780 region:rollup2
IMAGINATION SKILLS

02:49:14.645 --> 02:49:19.683 region:rollup2
THE THE SKILLS TO RELATE BASED

02:49:16.780 --> 02:49:20.317 region:rollup2
ON SHARED HUMAN EXPERIENCE THAT

02:49:19.683 --> 02:49:21.918 region:rollup2
GOES BACK MILLIONS OF YEARS OF

02:49:20.317 --> 02:49:24.121 region:rollup2
EVOLUTION.

02:49:21.918 --> 02:49:25.922 region:rollup2
THAT MACHINE STONE HALF.

02:49:24.121 --> 02:49:27.724 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED TO FRANKLY ALSO HELP

02:49:25.922 --> 02:49:30.060 region:rollup2
HUMANS AND THESE YOUNG CHILDREN

02:49:27.724 --> 02:49:31.995 region:rollup2
IN PARTICULAR. HOW TO EXERCISE

02:49:30.060 --> 02:49:33.296 region:rollup2
THAT MUSCLE?

02:49:31.995 --> 02:49:34.264 region:rollup2
NOT BE LIKE THE MACHINE TO

02:49:33.296 --> 02:49:35.999 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE MACHINE TO

02:49:34.264 --> 02:49:38.802 region:rollup2
INTERPRET THE MACHINE TO USE THE

02:49:35.999 --> 02:49:40.637 region:rollup2
MACHINE. BUT FRANKLY TO BE THEY

02:49:38.802 --> 02:49:41.638 region:rollup2
HUMAN AND THAT PARTNERSHIP.

02:49:40.637 --> 02:49:43.040 region:rollup2
AND NOT TO BE JUST LIKE ANOTHER

02:49:41.638 --> 02:49:44.641 region:rollup2
MACHINE.

02:49:43.040 --> 02:49:46.543 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT

02:49:44.641 --> 02:49:48.078 region:rollup2
WE AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

02:49:46.543 --> 02:49:48.645 region:rollup2
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE HUMAN

02:49:48.078 --> 02:49:50.047 region:rollup2
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GOOD AT

02:49:48.645 --> 02:49:51.048 region:rollup2
BEING HUMAN.

02:49:50.047 --> 02:49:52.482 region:rollup2
RIGHT OR ELSE WE WOULDN'T HAVE

02:49:51.048 --> 02:49:54.284 region:rollup2
THAT MANY PSYCHOLOGISTS AND

02:49:52.482 --> 02:49:56.453 region:rollup2
LAWYERS RUNNING AROUND. AYE AND

02:49:54.284 --> 02:49:58.422 region:rollup2
SO WE WE WE NEED TO GET BETTER

02:49:56.453 --> 02:49:58.922 region:rollup2
AT THIS AND. THERE IS NO REASON

02:49:58.422 --> 02:50:01.224 region:rollup2
WHY WE CAN'T TEACH TRUCK

02:49:58.922 --> 02:50:02.225 region:rollup2
DRIVERS.

02:50:01.224 --> 02:50:04.161 region:rollup2
TO.

02:50:02.225 --> 02:50:05.162 region:rollup2
HAVE A MORE PEOPLE CENTRIC JOB

02:50:04.161 --> 02:50:06.697 region:rollup2
SO FOR THE TIME THAT THEY'RE

02:50:05.162 --> 02:50:08.331 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE SITTING IN THE TRUCK

02:50:06.697 --> 02:50:09.599 region:rollup2
WITH THE HANDS OFF THE WHEEL.

02:50:08.331 --> 02:50:11.201 region:rollup2
OR WHEN THEY ARRIVE AT THE

02:50:09.599 --> 02:50:12.836 region:rollup2
CUSTOMER SITE.

02:50:11.201 --> 02:50:14.704 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY TAKE THE TRUCK OVER

02:50:12.836 --> 02:50:16.440 region:rollup2
FROM SOMEBODY ELSE.

02:50:14.704 --> 02:50:18.375 region:rollup2
OR WHEN THEY'RE COMMUNICATING

02:50:16.440 --> 02:50:20.043 region:rollup2
IN TRAFFIC MAYBE TAKING OVER

02:50:18.375 --> 02:50:20.811 region:rollup2
TRUCKS AND INNER CITY TRAFFIC.

02:50:20.043 --> 02:50:23.146 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

02:50:20.811 --> 02:50:24.815 region:rollup2
UPSCALING WE CAN DO ON JUST THE

02:50:23.146 --> 02:50:25.615 region:rollup2
HUMAN AND SOCIAL SIDE.

02:50:24.815 --> 02:50:27.684 region:rollup2
RIGHT THERE FRANKLY ALL OF US

02:50:25.615 --> 02:50:29.686 region:rollup2
COULD USE A BIT MORE OF.

02:50:27.684 --> 02:50:30.954 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK I THINK THERE IS

02:50:29.686 --> 02:50:33.390 region:rollup2
A LOT THAT WE CAN DO THERE.

02:50:30.954 --> 02:50:35.659 region:rollup2
ON THAT SKILL COMBINATION.

02:50:33.390 --> 02:50:37.461 region:rollup2
IF WE WE THINK EDUCATION.

02:50:35.659 --> 02:50:39.262 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THANK YOU MATCHA NEXT

02:50:37.461 --> 02:50:39.729 region:rollup2
SO LET'S GO TO A SERAPH LOCKS

02:50:39.262 --> 02:50:40.530 region:rollup2
WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR

02:50:39.729 --> 02:50:42.165 region:rollup2
FEDERATION.

02:50:40.530 --> 02:50:44.334 region:rollup2
WELCOME.

02:50:42.165 --> 02:50:45.669 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS

02:50:44.334 --> 02:50:47.704 region:rollup2
SARAH FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR

02:50:45.669 --> 02:50:49.473 region:rollup2
FEDERATION WE REPRESENT TWO

02:50:47.704 --> 02:50:51.007 region:rollup2
MILLION UNION MEMBERS AND THEIR

02:50:49.473 --> 02:50:53.577 region:rollup2
FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA.

02:50:51.007 --> 02:50:55.545 region:rollup2
ALMOST EVERY SINGLE ONE OF WHICH

02:50:53.577 --> 02:50:57.380 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN TOUCHED BY TECHNOLOGY

02:50:55.545 --> 02:50:58.915 region:rollup2
OR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN

02:50:57.380 --> 02:51:02.018 region:rollup2
SOME WAY ALREADY.

02:50:58.915 --> 02:51:03.720 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S CHANGES FROM.

02:51:02.018 --> 02:51:04.755 region:rollup2
REGULAR PHONES TO CELLPHONES

02:51:03.720 --> 02:51:07.057 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S CHANGES IN THE

02:51:04.755 --> 02:51:08.425 region:rollup2
MOVIE INDUSTRY WE'VE DEALT WITH

02:51:07.057 --> 02:51:10.360 region:rollup2
THESE KIND OF ISSUES.

02:51:08.425 --> 02:51:11.728 region:rollup2
AND I WANTED TO THANK THE

02:51:10.360 --> 02:51:12.796 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE AND THAT THE

02:51:11.728 --> 02:51:14.531 region:rollup2
PARTICIPANTS HERE TODAY FOR

02:51:12.796 --> 02:51:16.066 region:rollup2
TACKLING SUCH.

02:51:14.531 --> 02:51:18.935 region:rollup2
A HUGE ISSUE.

02:51:16.066 --> 02:51:20.804 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY IS GOING TO TOUCH

02:51:18.935 --> 02:51:21.538 region:rollup2
ALL OF US IN SO MANY WAYS.

02:51:20.804 --> 02:51:23.306 region:rollup2
AND ESPECIALLY IN IN THE

02:51:21.538 --> 02:51:25.742 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE

02:51:23.306 --> 02:51:27.744 region:rollup2
AND AS I WAS TRYING TO THINK OF.

02:51:25.742 --> 02:51:28.812 region:rollup2
MY COMMENTS TODAY ON POLICY ON

02:51:27.744 --> 02:51:30.680 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES ON THE

02:51:28.812 --> 02:51:32.349 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES IT SUCH A HUGE

02:51:30.680 --> 02:51:34.751 region:rollup2
TOPIC.

02:51:32.349 --> 02:51:36.086 region:rollup2
AND THE FUTURE. SEEMS VERY

02:51:34.751 --> 02:51:37.487 region:rollup2
UNKNOWN THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT

02:51:36.086 --> 02:51:39.089 region:rollup2
VISIONS OF IT WHETHER IT'S GOING

02:51:37.487 --> 02:51:40.157 region:rollup2
TO BE A ROBOT APOCALYPSE WAR

02:51:39.089 --> 02:51:41.358 region:rollup2
THERE'S MORE THE TECHNO

02:51:40.157 --> 02:51:43.059 region:rollup2
OPTIMISTS.

02:51:41.358 --> 02:51:44.995 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S VERY HARD TO PREDICT

02:51:43.059 --> 02:51:46.530 region:rollup2
AND SO.

02:51:44.995 --> 02:51:47.964 region:rollup2
I WAS REALLY STRUCK WHEN MISTER

02:51:46.530 --> 02:51:49.266 region:rollup2
OBERNOLTE RAISE THE ISSUE OF

02:51:47.964 --> 02:51:51.935 region:rollup2
THEIR PRODUCTS.

02:51:49.266 --> 02:51:53.870 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK THAT GOING BACK

02:51:51.935 --> 02:51:55.572 region:rollup2
IN HISTORY ACTUALLY HOLD SOME

02:51:53.870 --> 02:51:56.573 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT LESSONS FOR US

02:51:55.572 --> 02:51:58.375 region:rollup2
TODAY.

02:51:56.573 --> 02:52:01.578 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I WOULD SAY THAT THAT

02:51:58.375 --> 02:52:02.913 region:rollup2
WAS A PUBLIC POLICY FAILED.

02:52:01.578 --> 02:52:04.314 region:rollup2
AND WE SHOULD LEARN FROM THE

02:52:02.913 --> 02:52:06.049 region:rollup2
MISTAKES THAT WERE MADE THAT.

02:52:04.314 --> 02:52:07.350 region:rollup2
SO THE LUDDITES EVEN THOUGH

02:52:06.049 --> 02:52:09.319 region:rollup2
THEY'VE GOTTEN A BAD RAP AT

02:52:07.350 --> 02:52:11.188 region:rollup2
BEING ANTI TECH TECHNOLOGY WERE

02:52:09.319 --> 02:52:12.656 region:rollup2
NOT THEY WERE SKILLED WEAVERS

02:52:11.188 --> 02:52:16.326 region:rollup2
THEY WERE ARTISANS.

02:52:12.656 --> 02:52:17.627 region:rollup2
THEY HAD GOOD PAYING JOBS AND

02:52:16.326 --> 02:52:19.896 region:rollup2
BEFORE BASICALLY THE INDUSTRIAL

02:52:17.627 --> 02:52:21.765 region:rollup2
REVOLUTION AND WHAT HAPPENED IS

02:52:19.896 --> 02:52:23.433 region:rollup2
GARMENT MAKERS BROUGHT IN THE

02:52:21.765 --> 02:52:24.901 region:rollup2
MACHINE LIAM.

02:52:23.433 --> 02:52:26.703 region:rollup2
WHICH IS PROBABLY THE EQUIVALENT

02:52:24.901 --> 02:52:28.638 region:rollup2
OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

02:52:26.703 --> 02:52:30.841 region:rollup2
IN AT THAT TIME.

02:52:28.638 --> 02:52:32.342 region:rollup2
AND THIS WAS SOMETHING WHERE

02:52:30.841 --> 02:52:33.910 region:rollup2
THEY COULD BE SILLY DE SKILL THE

02:52:32.342 --> 02:52:35.178 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE AND THE COULD PRODUCE

02:52:33.910 --> 02:52:36.112 region:rollup2
A LOT MORE GOODSA LOT MORE

02:52:35.178 --> 02:52:37.647 region:rollup2
TROUSERS AND MAKE A LOT MORE

02:52:36.112 --> 02:52:40.584 region:rollup2
MONEY.

02:52:37.647 --> 02:52:41.685 region:rollup2
AND PAY OF A LOT LESS

02:52:40.584 --> 02:52:43.386 region:rollup2
AND BASICALLY WHAT THE LUDDITES

02:52:41.685 --> 02:52:44.888 region:rollup2
SIDE IS.

02:52:43.386 --> 02:52:46.656 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL

02:52:44.888 --> 02:52:48.191 region:rollup2
HOW THE LEAVES ARE USED WE THINK

02:52:46.656 --> 02:52:49.759 region:rollup2
THE LOOMS COULD BE USED TO MAKE

02:52:48.191 --> 02:52:52.195 region:rollup2
US MORE PRODUCTIVE TO MAKE WORK

02:52:49.759 --> 02:52:53.563 region:rollup2
SAFER WE DEPLORE MORE PEOPLE AND

02:52:52.195 --> 02:52:55.031 region:rollup2
SAID THEY THEY SAID WE HAVE

02:52:53.563 --> 02:52:56.700 region:rollup2
CERTAIN DEMANDS.

02:52:55.031 --> 02:52:58.969 region:rollup2
SLOW DOWN THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE

02:52:56.700 --> 02:53:01.438 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY CONSULT WITH US

02:52:58.969 --> 02:53:02.405 region:rollup2
ASK US WERE SKILLED WORKERS WE

02:53:01.438 --> 02:53:04.107 region:rollup2
MIGHT HAVE SOME IDEAS ON HOW

02:53:02.405 --> 02:53:04.741 region:rollup2
THIS COULD.

02:53:04.107 --> 02:53:07.043 region:rollup2
IT'S TECHNOLOGY COULD BE USED

02:53:04.741 --> 02:53:08.678 region:rollup2
BETTER WE NEED TO HAVE A WAY TO

02:53:07.043 --> 02:53:10.247 region:rollup2
MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS

02:53:08.678 --> 02:53:11.881 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO HAVE A SOCIAL SAFETY

02:53:10.247 --> 02:53:13.316 region:rollup2
NET WE NEED TO HAVE A TRANSITION

02:53:11.881 --> 02:53:14.885 region:rollup2
PLAN.

02:53:13.316 --> 02:53:16.853 region:rollup2
WE NEED ALL OF THIS AND SO THEY

02:53:14.885 --> 02:53:18.488 region:rollup2
WENT TO THE EMPLOYERS AND ASKED

02:53:16.853 --> 02:53:19.956 region:rollup2
FOR THIS AND. THE EMPLOYERS

02:53:18.488 --> 02:53:21.558 region:rollup2
BASICALLY SAID NO.

02:53:19.956 --> 02:53:22.692 region:rollup2
WE ARE GOING TO FIRE YOU ALL

02:53:21.558 --> 02:53:24.661 region:rollup2
WERE GOING TO BRING IN LOWER

02:53:22.692 --> 02:53:25.929 region:rollup2
SKILLED WORKERS THEY'RE GONNA BE

02:53:24.661 --> 02:53:27.497 region:rollup2
PAID LAST THEY'RE GONNA WORK

02:53:25.929 --> 02:53:28.865 region:rollup2
FASTER AND WE'RE GOING TO TURN

02:53:27.497 --> 02:53:30.900 region:rollup2
OUT WHAT WAS ACTUALLY NOT AS

02:53:28.865 --> 02:53:33.270 region:rollup2
GOOD OF A PRODUCT.

02:53:30.900 --> 02:53:34.671 region:rollup2
AND WHEN THEY'RE BASICALLY

02:53:33.270 --> 02:53:36.606 region:rollup2
WASN'T IMPASSE IN THEIR

02:53:34.671 --> 02:53:37.874 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS THE LUDDITES FINALLY

02:53:36.606 --> 02:53:39.509 region:rollup2
CAME TO THE POINT WHERE THEY

02:53:37.874 --> 02:53:41.344 region:rollup2
WERE GOING TO SMASH THE MACHINES

02:53:39.509 --> 02:53:44.114 region:rollup2
AND THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT CAME

02:53:41.344 --> 02:53:45.682 region:rollup2
IN. AND. BASICALLY PUT DOWN

02:53:44.114 --> 02:53:47.484 region:rollup2
THEIR UPRISING

02:53:45.682 --> 02:53:49.419 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT WAS THE CORE FOR THE

02:53:47.484 --> 02:53:51.187 region:rollup2
LIGHT AIDS WAS THAT THEY WEREN'T

02:53:49.419 --> 02:53:52.889 region:rollup2
ANTI TECHNOLOGY.

02:53:51.187 --> 02:53:53.690 region:rollup2
THEY WANTED TO HAVE A VOICE IN

02:53:52.889 --> 02:53:55.358 region:rollup2
THE WAY THAT TECHNOLOGY WAS

02:53:53.690 --> 02:53:56.960 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED.

02:53:55.358 --> 02:54:00.263 region:rollup2
THE WAIT WAS DEPLOYED IN THE

02:53:56.960 --> 02:54:02.165 region:rollup2
WORK FORCE AND THE WAY. THE

02:54:00.263 --> 02:54:03.233 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTION OF.

02:54:02.165 --> 02:54:05.101 region:rollup2
FRUITS OF THAT THE WAY THE

02:54:03.233 --> 02:54:05.535 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTION OF THE BENEFITS OF

02:54:05.101 --> 02:54:07.304 region:rollup2
THAT TECHNOLOGY WERE

02:54:05.535 --> 02:54:07.904 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTED.

02:54:07.304 --> 02:54:08.738 region:rollup2
MAYBE SO I WANTED TO SHARE OF

02:54:07.904 --> 02:54:10.540 region:rollup2
IT.

02:54:08.738 --> 02:54:11.141 region:rollup2
AND THEY FELT LIKE THEY AND

02:54:10.540 --> 02:54:12.943 region:rollup2
SOCIETY SHOULD HAVE A SHARE OF

02:54:11.141 --> 02:54:14.878 region:rollup2
IT.

02:54:12.943 --> 02:54:15.879 region:rollup2
DOT REBELLION WAS PUT DOWN AND

02:54:14.878 --> 02:54:17.580 region:rollup2
THEN WE MOVED ON TO THE

02:54:15.879 --> 02:54:19.716 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.

02:54:17.580 --> 02:54:21.952 region:rollup2
AND I THINK RIGHT NOW. THAT'S A

02:54:19.716 --> 02:54:23.787 region:rollup2
GOOD LESSON FOR US BECAUSE WE'RE

02:54:21.952 --> 02:54:26.156 region:rollup2
AT THE POINT WHERE WE ARE FACING

02:54:23.787 --> 02:54:28.525 region:rollup2
HUGE TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES.

02:54:26.156 --> 02:54:31.194 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE

02:54:28.525 --> 02:54:33.396 region:rollup2
BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY ARTIFICIAL

02:54:31.194 --> 02:54:34.965 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE WHATEVER IT IS IT'S

02:54:33.396 --> 02:54:36.299 region:rollup2
BASICALLY NEUTRAL.

02:54:34.965 --> 02:54:38.268 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT INHERENTLY GOOD ARE

02:54:36.299 --> 02:54:39.536 region:rollup2
INHERENTLY BAD.

02:54:38.268 --> 02:54:41.638 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT AS THE LABOR

02:54:39.536 --> 02:54:43.540 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT

02:54:41.638 --> 02:54:45.542 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY ARTIFICIAL

02:54:43.540 --> 02:54:47.544 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE AUTOMATION.

02:54:45.542 --> 02:54:48.845 region:rollup2
HAS ENORMOUS POTENTIAL WE THINK

02:54:47.544 --> 02:54:50.747 region:rollup2
IT HAS GREAT POTENTIAL TO MAKE

02:54:48.845 --> 02:54:53.750 region:rollup2
WORK SAFER TO MAKE IT MORE

02:54:50.747 --> 02:54:57.887 region:rollup2
INTERESTING TO UP SKILL WORKERS.

02:54:53.750 --> 02:54:58.955 region:rollup2
TO BASICALLY CREATE MORE WORK

02:54:57.887 --> 02:55:01.424 region:rollup2
FOR EVERYBODY.

02:54:58.955 --> 02:55:03.560 region:rollup2
AND TWO FOR THOSE BENEFITS TO

02:55:01.424 --> 02:55:05.595 region:rollup2
ACCRUE TO SOCIETY. UP TO HAVE A

02:55:03.560 --> 02:55:06.696 region:rollup2
BETTER DISTRIBUTION OF THE

02:55:05.595 --> 02:55:08.465 region:rollup2
WEALTH SO WE CAN DO SOMETHING

02:55:06.696 --> 02:55:09.766 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT AND INCOME INEQUALITY

02:55:08.465 --> 02:55:11.768 region:rollup2
AND WADE STAGNATION AND THE

02:55:09.766 --> 02:55:13.370 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATION OF WEALTH IN THE

02:55:11.768 --> 02:55:14.938 region:rollup2
HANDS OF THE FEW. SO WE THINK

02:55:13.370 --> 02:55:17.073 region:rollup2
THOUGH THAT POTENTIAL IS THERE

02:55:14.938 --> 02:55:19.409 region:rollup2
BUT I REALLY DEPENDS ON

02:55:17.073 --> 02:55:21.344 region:rollup2
DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE NOW.

02:55:19.409 --> 02:55:22.946 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHAT WE THINK WOULD BE A

02:55:21.344 --> 02:55:25.582 region:rollup2
MISTAKE IS TO STEP BACK AND DO

02:55:22.946 --> 02:55:27.684 region:rollup2
NOTHING AND HAVE TECHNOLOGY

02:55:25.582 --> 02:55:29.219 region:rollup2
BASICALLY RECREATE THE TRENDS

02:55:27.684 --> 02:55:30.653 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING NOW WHICH IS

02:55:29.219 --> 02:55:32.655 region:rollup2
TOWARDS GREATER INCOME

02:55:30.653 --> 02:55:33.423 region:rollup2
INEQUALITY. AND CONCENTRATION OF

02:55:32.655 --> 02:55:35.258 region:rollup2
WEALTH IN THE HANDS OF THE.

02:55:33.423 --> 02:55:37.327 region:rollup2
.

02:55:35.258 --> 02:55:39.863 region:rollup2
AND SO WORK ALREADY KIND OF

02:55:37.327 --> 02:55:42.432 region:rollup2
SEEING HIMSELF THAT IN THAT THE

02:55:39.863 --> 02:55:44.000 region:rollup2
WAY TECHNOLOGY IS BEING DEPLOYED

02:55:42.432 --> 02:55:44.501 region:rollup2
TODAY I THINK DODD TALKED A

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:45.602 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE GIG

02:55:44.501 --> 02:55:48.505 region:rollup2
ECONOMY.

02:55:45.602 --> 02:55:50.006 region:rollup2
AND HOW AT THE USE OF APPS ARE

02:55:48.505 --> 02:55:50.940 region:rollup2
ARE BASICALLY ALLOWING FOR

02:55:50.006 --> 02:55:53.076 region:rollup2
ARMIES OF INDEPENDENT

02:55:50.940 --> 02:55:54.377 region:rollup2
CONTRACTORS TO BE DEPLOYED IT

02:55:53.076 --> 02:55:57.647 region:rollup2
MAKES IT MORE CONVENIENT FOR THE

02:55:54.377 --> 02:55:59.949 region:rollup2
CONSUMER. BUT IN SOME CASES LIKE

02:55:57.647 --> 02:56:01.584 region:rollup2
YOU OF UBER DRIVERS THEIR MAKING

02:55:59.949 --> 02:56:02.786 region:rollup2
THREE DOLLARS AND THIRTY SEVEN

02:56:01.584 --> 02:56:03.887 region:rollup2
CENTS AN HOUR.

02:56:02.786 --> 02:56:05.588 region:rollup2
YOU OF COURSE HAVE COMPANIES

02:56:03.887 --> 02:56:06.356 region:rollup2
LIKE POST MAY IT'S WHICH SOUNDS

02:56:05.588 --> 02:56:07.490 region:rollup2
LIKE THEY'RE REALLY DOING THE

02:56:06.356 --> 02:56:09.159 region:rollup2
RIGHT THING AND HAVE WORKERS

02:56:07.490 --> 02:56:10.460 region:rollup2
THAT ARE WELL PAID AND THEY'RE

02:56:09.159 --> 02:56:11.594 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT THEM.

02:56:10.460 --> 02:56:13.196 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT A

02:56:11.594 --> 02:56:14.564 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE THAT'S REALLY UP TO

02:56:13.196 --> 02:56:15.932 region:rollup2
EVERY COMPANY TO MAKE THAT THAT

02:56:14.564 --> 02:56:17.300 region:rollup2
DECISION.

02:56:15.932 --> 02:56:18.101 region:rollup2
YOU ALSO SEE IT IN THE USE OF

02:56:17.300 --> 02:56:20.103 region:rollup2
ALGORITHMS.

02:56:18.101 --> 02:56:22.505 region:rollup2
.

02:56:20.103 --> 02:56:24.107 region:rollup2
THESE WE'VE SEEN THESE M. TO BE

02:56:22.505 --> 02:56:26.342 region:rollup2
USED IN SCHEDULING YOU MIGHT.

02:56:24.107 --> 02:56:28.445 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW STARBUCKS GIAMBI JUICE

02:56:26.342 --> 02:56:30.447 region:rollup2
WALMART THEY ALL DO THIS JUST IN

02:56:28.445 --> 02:56:32.549 region:rollup2
TIME SCHEDULING WHERE THEY

02:56:30.447 --> 02:56:34.884 region:rollup2
BASICALLY TAKEN ALGORITHMS AND

02:56:32.549 --> 02:56:36.352 region:rollup2
THEY PROGRAM THEM WITH. WET AS

02:56:34.884 --> 02:56:37.720 region:rollup2
CUSTOMER DEMANDS HIGH WHEN'S IT

02:56:36.352 --> 02:56:38.955 region:rollup2
GONNA BE SUNNY SO PEOPLE COME IN

02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:40.290 region:rollup2
FOR THE JOB WOULD USE ONCE AGAIN

02:56:38.955 --> 02:56:41.424 region:rollup2
BE RAINY SO THEY COME IN FOR

02:56:40.290 --> 02:56:42.926 region:rollup2
THEIR LOTS A. AND SO THEY

02:56:41.424 --> 02:56:45.728 region:rollup2
BASICALLY PUT ALL OF THESE.

02:56:42.926 --> 02:56:46.362 region:rollup2
.

02:56:45.728 --> 02:56:47.997 region:rollup2
THEORY OF VARIABLES I DON'T OF

02:56:46.362 --> 02:56:49.966 region:rollup2
ATTACK TERM INTO THIS ALGORITHM

02:56:47.997 --> 02:56:50.900 region:rollup2
SO THEY COME UP WITH PERFECT

02:56:49.966 --> 02:56:51.835 region:rollup2
SCHEDULING.

02:56:50.900 --> 02:56:53.336 region:rollup2
BUT THE SCHEDULING IS PERFECT

02:56:51.835 --> 02:56:54.904 region:rollup2
FOR THE COMPANY

02:56:53.336 --> 02:56:56.539 region:rollup2
IT MAKES WORKERS COME MEN FOR

02:56:54.904 --> 02:56:58.441 region:rollup2
THE TWO HOURS WHEN THEIR BUSIEST

02:56:56.539 --> 02:56:59.776 region:rollup2
AND INTO SENDS THEM.

02:56:58.441 --> 02:57:01.678 region:rollup2
THAT'S GREAT FOR THE COMPANY

02:56:59.776 --> 02:57:02.745 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DRIVING DOWN LABOR COSTS

02:57:01.678 --> 02:57:04.080 region:rollup2
BUT IS NOT GREAT FOR THE WORKER

02:57:02.745 --> 02:57:05.148 region:rollup2
WHO HAS TO TRAVEL AN HOUR FOR

02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:07.450 region:rollup2
THEIR TWO HOUR SHIFT AT MINIMUM

02:57:05.148 --> 02:57:08.918 region:rollup2
WAGE.

02:57:07.450 --> 02:57:11.154 region:rollup2
BUT THAT ALGORITHM THAT SAME

02:57:08.918 --> 02:57:12.989 region:rollup2
ALGORITHM COULD BE USED TO SAY

02:57:11.154 --> 02:57:14.424 region:rollup2
OH YOU'RE WORKER YOU OF CHILD

02:57:12.989 --> 02:57:15.992 region:rollup2
CARE YOU'RE ANOTHER WORKER WHO'S

02:57:14.424 --> 02:57:17.627 region:rollup2
TRYING TO HAVE A SECOND JOB

02:57:15.992 --> 02:57:19.395 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL WE'RE

02:57:17.627 --> 02:57:21.331 region:rollup2
GONNA FIGURE OUT THE WAY TO USE

02:57:19.395 --> 02:57:22.899 region:rollup2
THAT ALGORITHM. TO MAKE WORK

02:57:21.331 --> 02:57:25.869 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BETTER DEBT MAKE

02:57:22.899 --> 02:57:27.504 region:rollup2
SCHEDULES WORK SO THAT YOU KNOW

02:57:25.869 --> 02:57:28.805 region:rollup2
A MOM CAN TAKE CARE FOR CHILDREN

02:57:27.504 --> 02:57:31.608 region:rollup2
OR TAKE A KID TO WORK.

02:57:28.805 --> 02:57:32.976 region:rollup2
ALL OF THAT ALGORITHMS RELIEF IS

02:57:31.608 --> 02:57:33.576 region:rollup2
NEUTRAL IT'S JUST THAT THE

02:57:32.976 --> 02:57:35.278 region:rollup2
COMPANIES HAVE DECIDED TO USE

02:57:33.576 --> 02:57:37.514 region:rollup2
IT.

02:57:35.278 --> 02:57:39.849 region:rollup2
TO BECOME MORE PROFITABLE WHICH

02:57:37.514 --> 02:57:41.351 region:rollup2
IS WHAT THEIR MISSION IS VERSES

02:57:39.849 --> 02:57:42.619 region:rollup2
IN THE INTERESTS OF. THEIR

02:57:41.351 --> 02:57:45.755 region:rollup2
WORKERS.

02:57:42.619 --> 02:57:47.891 region:rollup2
AND SO WE REALLY FEEL LIKE IT IS

02:57:45.755 --> 02:57:50.093 region:rollup2
AT THAT POINT WHERE WE NEED

02:57:47.891 --> 02:57:51.194 region:rollup2
POLICYMAKERS TO STEP BEN.

02:57:50.093 --> 02:57:53.196 region:rollup2
AND TO SAY.

02:57:51.194 --> 02:57:54.964 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT.

02:57:53.196 --> 02:57:57.166 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS

02:57:54.964 --> 02:57:59.769 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO BE

02:57:57.166 --> 02:58:01.070 region:rollup2
DEPLOYED NOT JUST NARROWLY FOR

02:57:59.769 --> 02:58:02.405 region:rollup2
SHAREHOLDERS OF A COMPANY AND

02:58:01.070 --> 02:58:03.606 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

02:58:02.405 --> 02:58:05.141 region:rollup2
WHAT COMPANIES ARE SUPPOSED TO

02:58:03.606 --> 02:58:06.876 region:rollup2
DO THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO

02:58:05.141 --> 02:58:08.111 region:rollup2
THEIR SHAREHOLDERS BUT HOW ARE

02:58:06.876 --> 02:58:12.315 region:rollup2
WE GOING TO SEE THAT THIS

02:58:08.111 --> 02:58:13.183 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IS? DEPLOYED ON.

02:58:12.315 --> 02:58:14.717 region:rollup2
A BROADER LEVEL FOR THE GOOD OF

02:58:13.183 --> 02:58:17.453 region:rollup2
SOCIETY.

02:58:14.717 --> 02:58:18.254 region:rollup2
AND SO ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS

02:58:17.453 --> 02:58:21.024 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD HAVE.

02:58:18.254 --> 02:58:22.058 region:rollup2
IN KIND OF THAT THE MACRO ON

02:58:21.024 --> 02:58:22.926 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD AS A

02:58:22.058 --> 02:58:23.960 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION IN TERMS OF

02:58:22.926 --> 02:58:25.728 region:rollup2
POLICY.

02:58:23.960 --> 02:58:27.497 region:rollup2
IS THAT.

02:58:25.728 --> 02:58:29.465 region:rollup2
POLICY MAKERS

02:58:27.497 --> 02:58:30.366 region:rollup2
PULL TOGETHER THE STAKEHOLDERS

02:58:29.465 --> 02:58:32.969 region:rollup2
WHICH INCLUDE PEOPLE AND

02:58:30.366 --> 02:58:34.938 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY ACADEMICS I WOULD SAY

02:58:32.969 --> 02:58:36.406 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVES OF WORKERS AND

02:58:34.938 --> 02:58:38.508 region:rollup2
UNIONS CONSUMERS.

02:58:36.406 --> 02:58:41.778 region:rollup2
.

02:58:38.508 --> 02:58:44.180 region:rollup2
AND SAY WE NEED TO COME UP WITH.

02:58:41.778 --> 02:58:46.983 region:rollup2
A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY AND

02:58:44.180 --> 02:58:48.851 region:rollup2
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK.

02:58:46.983 --> 02:58:50.820 region:rollup2
AND THIS FRAMEWORK NEEDS TO

02:58:48.851 --> 02:58:51.955 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT.

02:58:50.820 --> 02:58:54.123 region:rollup2
WHAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGIES NEED

02:58:51.955 --> 02:58:56.326 region:rollup2
TO BE DEVELOPED SO AT THE POINT

02:58:54.123 --> 02:58:57.961 region:rollup2
OF DEVELOPMENT SO THAT IT CAN

02:58:56.326 --> 02:59:00.396 region:rollup2
BENEFIT SOCIETY?

02:58:57.961 --> 02:59:01.798 region:rollup2
HOWARD THOSE TECHNOLOGIES GOING

02:59:00.396 --> 02:59:03.533 region:rollup2
TO BE DEPLOYED.

02:59:01.798 --> 02:59:05.168 region:rollup2
HOW ARE WE GOING TO MITIGATE

02:59:03.533 --> 02:59:06.869 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT THE NEGATIVE

02:59:05.168 --> 02:59:08.304 region:rollup2
IMPACTS OF THEM?

02:59:06.869 --> 02:59:10.540 region:rollup2
M. AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE

02:59:08.304 --> 02:59:13.409 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THE BENEFITS OF THESE

02:59:10.540 --> 02:59:15.445 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES ARE DISTRIBUTED IN

02:59:13.409 --> 02:59:17.213 region:rollup2
A WAY THAT MAKES SOCIETY. MORE

02:59:15.445 --> 02:59:19.382 region:rollup2
JUST AND EQUITABLE.

02:59:17.213 --> 02:59:20.750 region:rollup2
VERSES REPLICATING THE

02:59:19.382 --> 02:59:22.785 region:rollup2
INJUSTICES OF THE PAST IN THE

02:59:20.750 --> 02:59:25.455 region:rollup2
JUSTICES UP TODAY.

02:59:22.785 --> 02:59:27.156 region:rollup2
AND TECHNOLOGY I THINK AS A TOOL

02:59:25.455 --> 02:59:29.025 region:rollup2
THAT CAN GET US THERE BECAUSE

02:59:27.156 --> 02:59:30.627 region:rollup2
THERE'S GREAT POTENTIAL BUT

02:59:29.025 --> 02:59:31.861 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE.

02:59:30.627 --> 02:59:33.930 region:rollup2
ACTION.

02:59:31.861 --> 02:59:37.200 region:rollup2
AND VERY KIND OF.

02:59:33.930 --> 02:59:38.968 region:rollup2
I THINK PROACTIVE PREEMPTIVE AND

02:59:37.200 --> 02:59:42.205 region:rollup2
BIG ACTION THIS IS A TIME FOR

02:59:38.968 --> 02:59:43.072 region:rollup2
BIG IDEAS BECAUSE. IT'S AS IF

02:59:42.205 --> 02:59:44.741 region:rollup2
WE'RE ON THE CUSP OF THE

02:59:43.072 --> 02:59:46.209 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BUT WE

02:59:44.741 --> 02:59:47.844 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND

02:59:46.209 --> 02:59:49.312 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN MAKE CHOICES TO

02:59:47.844 --> 02:59:51.347 region:rollup2
MINIMIZE THE DISRUPTION.

02:59:49.312 --> 02:59:53.750 region:rollup2
.

02:59:51.347 --> 02:59:54.884 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK.

02:59:53.750 --> 02:59:56.152 region:rollup2
THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS THAT I

02:59:54.884 --> 02:59:58.454 region:rollup2
WANT TO TOUCH ON THAT'S KIND IN

02:59:56.152 --> 03:00:00.490 region:rollup2
THE BROAD FRAME AND I THINK

02:59:58.454 --> 03:00:01.858 region:rollup2
THERE'S THERE'S ROOM TO. TO A

03:00:00.490 --> 03:00:03.259 region:rollup2
JEW ADDRESS A LOT OF ISSUES IN

03:00:01.858 --> 03:00:05.395 region:rollup2
THAT OF COURSE WE'RE PRETTY

03:00:03.259 --> 03:00:07.830 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON THE WORKPLACE ISSUES.

03:00:05.395 --> 03:00:09.632 region:rollup2
BUT WE KNOW THAT IT TOUCHES.

03:00:07.830 --> 03:00:10.600 region:rollup2
OUR MEMBERS AND MANY OTHER

03:00:09.632 --> 03:00:12.201 region:rollup2
ASPECTS OF THEIR LIVES AS WELL.

03:00:10.600 --> 03:00:13.503 region:rollup2
.

03:00:12.201 --> 03:00:15.171 region:rollup2
BUT I WANT TO TOUCH ON A COUPLE

03:00:13.503 --> 03:00:16.172 region:rollup2
ISSUES WITH IN THAT.

03:00:15.171 --> 03:00:17.940 region:rollup2
.

03:00:16.172 --> 03:00:20.109 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

03:00:17.940 --> 03:00:21.544 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT SEEING. THE ROBOT

03:00:20.109 --> 03:00:23.012 region:rollup2
APOCALYPSE HAPPENING WE'RE

03:00:21.544 --> 03:00:24.814 region:rollup2
SEEING A MUCH MORE KIND OF

03:00:23.012 --> 03:00:26.282 region:rollup2
SUBTLE DEPLOYMENT OF OF

03:00:24.814 --> 03:00:28.084 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY WHERE IT WHETHER IT'S

03:00:26.282 --> 03:00:30.920 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

03:00:28.084 --> 03:00:33.489 region:rollup2
OR WHETHER IT'S THE AUTOMATION

03:00:30.920 --> 03:00:35.625 region:rollup2
OF PARTS OF JOBS OF TASKS WHICH

03:00:33.489 --> 03:00:36.125 region:rollup2
WAS VERY STRIKING IN THE KINSEY

03:00:35.625 --> 03:00:38.628 region:rollup2
REPORT THAT I THINK THE

03:00:36.125 --> 03:00:40.763 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE GOT. WAS THAT.

03:00:38.628 --> 03:00:42.765 region:rollup2
STEEP PERCENT OF ALL OCCUPATIONS

03:00:40.763 --> 03:00:43.1000 region:rollup2
BY TWENTY THIRTY.

03:00:42.765 --> 03:00:46.069 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE AT LEAST THIRTY

03:00:43.1000 --> 03:00:48.471 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THEIR TASKS

03:00:46.069 --> 03:00:49.739 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE AUTOMATED.

03:00:48.471 --> 03:00:51.240 region:rollup2
WHICH MEANS THAT IT'S NOT GONNA

03:00:49.739 --> 03:00:52.742 region:rollup2
BE A ROBOT THAT COMES AND

03:00:51.240 --> 03:00:54.977 region:rollup2
REPLACES IT IT'S GOING TO BE THE

03:00:52.742 --> 03:00:56.312 region:rollup2
SUBTLE SHIFTS IN THE WORKPLACE.

03:00:54.977 --> 03:00:58.014 region:rollup2
THAT COULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

03:00:56.312 --> 03:00:59.582 region:rollup2
FOR UPSCALING.

03:00:58.014 --> 03:01:01.584 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

03:00:59.582 --> 03:01:04.721 region:rollup2
DE SKILLED WORKERS TO PAY THEM

03:01:01.584 --> 03:01:06.422 region:rollup2
LAST AND TO REALLY DRIVE DOWN.

03:01:04.721 --> 03:01:07.156 region:rollup2
WAGES AND CONDITIONS SO THE

03:01:06.422 --> 03:01:08.658 region:rollup2
THING THAT I THINK WOULD BE

03:01:07.156 --> 03:01:11.728 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT IS WE CAN'T

03:01:08.658 --> 03:01:13.730 region:rollup2
JUST LOOK AT NET JOB CREATION.

03:01:11.728 --> 03:01:15.465 region:rollup2
LIKE WE AUTOMATED ONE JOB BUT WE

03:01:13.730 --> 03:01:16.733 region:rollup2
CREATED ANOTHER JOB SO THAT'S

03:01:15.465 --> 03:01:18.201 region:rollup2
FINE WE NEED TO REALLY LOOK AT

03:01:16.733 --> 03:01:22.105 region:rollup2
THE QUALITY OF JOBS.

03:01:18.201 --> 03:01:24.307 region:rollup2
WE SEE THIS WHEN YOU. GET RID

03:01:22.105 --> 03:01:26.876 region:rollup2
OF A UPS TRACKING DR JOB OR YOU

03:01:24.307 --> 03:01:29.112 region:rollup2
GET RID OF IT AUTOMATES II

03:01:26.876 --> 03:01:30.747 region:rollup2
TRUCKERS JOB AND THEN THE GO BE

03:01:29.112 --> 03:01:32.248 region:rollup2
AN AMAZON GIVE WORKER.

03:01:30.747 --> 03:01:34.917 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE A GOOD UNION

03:01:32.248 --> 03:01:36.719 region:rollup2
JOB AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S A

03:01:34.917 --> 03:01:38.221 region:rollup2
LOW WAGE TEMPORARY PART TIME

03:01:36.719 --> 03:01:39.188 region:rollup2
SEASONAL JOB

03:01:38.221 --> 03:01:40.189 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

03:01:39.188 --> 03:01:41.657 region:rollup2
REBUILD OUR MIDDLE CLASS WITH

03:01:40.189 --> 03:01:43.326 region:rollup2
THAT'S WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION

03:01:41.657 --> 03:01:45.728 region:rollup2
TO JOB QUALITY.

03:01:43.326 --> 03:01:47.697 region:rollup2
AND NOT JUST JOB CREATION.

03:01:45.728 --> 03:01:49.866 region:rollup2
THAT'S A BIG PIECE.

03:01:47.697 --> 03:01:51.234 region:rollup2
THE SAFETY NET I DON'T KNOW

03:01:49.866 --> 03:01:52.668 region:rollup2
MISS PART IS I DON'T OF THE

03:01:51.234 --> 03:01:54.337 region:rollup2
SAFETY NET HAS BEEN.

03:01:52.668 --> 03:01:55.738 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED.

03:01:54.337 --> 03:01:56.672 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PART I KNOW

03:01:55.738 --> 03:01:58.141 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

03:01:56.672 --> 03:01:58.908 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT UNIVERSAL

03:01:58.141 --> 03:02:00.009 region:rollup2
BASIC INCOME AND PORTABLE

03:01:58.908 --> 03:02:02.211 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

03:02:00.009 --> 03:02:04.147 region:rollup2
.

03:02:02.211 --> 03:02:06.149 region:rollup2
I DO THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY

03:02:04.147 --> 03:02:07.817 region:rollup2
CAREFUL ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE

03:02:06.149 --> 03:02:09.085 region:rollup2
ALREADY HAVE A SAFETY NET IT'S

03:02:07.817 --> 03:02:11.788 region:rollup2
DESIGNED FOR WHEN PEOPLEARE OUT

03:02:09.085 --> 03:02:13.623 region:rollup2
OF WORK IT IS ALREADY FRAYING

03:02:11.788 --> 03:02:15.425 region:rollup2
AND IT IS ALREADY UNDER ATTACK.

03:02:13.623 --> 03:02:17.160 region:rollup2
BASICALLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

03:02:15.425 --> 03:02:18.394 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SAFETY

03:02:17.160 --> 03:02:20.630 region:rollup2
NET WE ALWAYS HAVE TO THINK

03:02:18.394 --> 03:02:21.230 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHO'S GONNA PAY FOR IT AND

03:02:20.630 --> 03:02:22.031 region:rollup2
WHO'S GONNA MAKE SURE IT'S IN

03:02:21.230 --> 03:02:23.933 region:rollup2
THERE.

03:02:22.031 --> 03:02:26.936 region:rollup2
AND SO WITH UNIVERSAL BASIC IN

03:02:23.933 --> 03:02:28.604 region:rollup2
INCOME IT'S A GREAT IDEA BUT HOW

03:02:26.936 --> 03:02:31.007 region:rollup2
ARE WE GONNA FIND IT.

03:02:28.604 --> 03:02:32.375 region:rollup2
AND HOW WE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT

03:02:31.007 --> 03:02:34.143 region:rollup2
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HELPS

03:02:32.375 --> 03:02:35.478 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TRANSITION TO WORK

03:02:34.143 --> 03:02:36.612 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE REALLY THINK THAT

03:02:35.478 --> 03:02:38.614 region:rollup2
THERE IS VALUE IN WORK AND

03:02:36.612 --> 03:02:39.849 region:rollup2
THERE'S DIGNITY AND WORK.

03:02:38.614 --> 03:02:42.185 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE.

03:02:39.849 --> 03:02:44.220 region:rollup2
.

03:02:42.185 --> 03:02:45.321 region:rollup2
AND RICH RETRAINING I THINK

03:02:44.220 --> 03:02:47.223 region:rollup2
PROFESSOR BROUGHT ME GREAT

03:02:45.321 --> 03:02:48.524 region:rollup2
POINTS IT'S WE NEED TO HAVE A

03:02:47.223 --> 03:02:50.259 region:rollup2
JOB MATCHING.

03:02:48.524 --> 03:02:51.127 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IF

03:02:50.259 --> 03:02:52.562 region:rollup2
THERE'S ANY TRAINING OR

03:02:51.127 --> 03:02:54.430 region:rollup2
RETRAINING WERE PUTTING PEOPLE

03:02:52.562 --> 03:02:56.799 region:rollup2
INTO A JOB AND WE'RE PUTTING

03:02:54.430 --> 03:02:58.835 region:rollup2
PEOPLE INTO A HIGH QUALITY JOB.

03:02:56.799 --> 03:03:01.304 region:rollup2
YOU NOT GONNA TAKE A UNION TRUCK

03:02:58.835 --> 03:03:03.840 region:rollup2
DRIVER A UNION. A CHECKER AT A

03:03:01.304 --> 03:03:07.877 region:rollup2
SUPERMARKET A UNION GRIP ON A ON

03:03:03.840 --> 03:03:09.545 region:rollup2
A. YOU KNOW A FILM SAT. AND SAY.

03:03:07.877 --> 03:03:11.013 region:rollup2
OKAY NOW WE'RE GONNA PUT YOU

03:03:09.545 --> 03:03:12.748 region:rollup2
INTO BEING A DISHWASHER OR

03:03:11.013 --> 03:03:14.083 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT'S NOT.

03:03:12.748 --> 03:03:15.117 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT HELPING WITH ECONOMIC

03:03:14.083 --> 03:03:16.686 region:rollup2
GROWTH

03:03:15.117 --> 03:03:19.188 region:rollup2
SO THAT I THINK IS IT A BIG

03:03:16.686 --> 03:03:20.823 region:rollup2
PIECES WELL AND I THINK WHAT WE

03:03:19.188 --> 03:03:22.859 region:rollup2
CAN IN YOUR PROGRAM.

03:03:20.823 --> 03:03:23.359 region:rollup2
WORK WISH WHICH YES YES IT'S

03:03:22.859 --> 03:03:25.361 region:rollup2
VERY SIMILAR ARGUE WITH

03:03:23.359 --> 03:03:26.262 region:rollup2
INDIFFERENCE TO PROGRAMS WE HAVE

03:03:25.361 --> 03:03:28.097 region:rollup2
EARN WHILE YOU LEARN.

03:03:26.262 --> 03:03:29.198 region:rollup2
I THINK THE SAME THING IS IS

03:03:28.097 --> 03:03:30.967 region:rollup2
REALLY POSSIBLE HEARING

03:03:29.198 --> 03:03:33.169 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY I THINK ENABLES THAT

03:03:30.967 --> 03:03:34.804 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT WILL BE A BIG A BIG

03:03:33.169 --> 03:03:35.304 region:rollup2
PIECE OF IT IS MAKING SURE THAT

03:03:34.804 --> 03:03:37.807 region:rollup2
WE'RE VERY AWARE OF THAT

03:03:35.304 --> 03:03:39.442 region:rollup2
TRANSITION.

03:03:37.807 --> 03:03:40.843 region:rollup2
AND THEN I'M ALSO YOU KNOW WHAT

03:03:39.442 --> 03:03:41.911 region:rollup2
I BECOME TAKE A LESSON FROM THE

03:03:40.843 --> 03:03:44.714 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE.

03:03:41.911 --> 03:03:46.616 region:rollup2
A CREW AND ACTIVISTS IS ADOPTION

03:03:44.714 --> 03:03:48.317 region:rollup2
HOW ARE WE GOING TO ADAPT AND I

03:03:46.616 --> 03:03:52.188 region:rollup2
THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME

03:03:48.317 --> 03:03:54.357 region:rollup2
REALLY BIG IDEAS M. BECAUSE.

03:03:52.188 --> 03:03:56.192 region:rollup2
WE MAY HAVE A POINT WHERE

03:03:54.357 --> 03:03:57.927 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY BEASTLY SAYS THAT WE

03:03:56.192 --> 03:03:59.896 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO HAVE FEWER JOBS.

03:03:57.927 --> 03:04:02.532 region:rollup2
WE JUST.

03:03:59.896 --> 03:04:03.933 region:rollup2
IT MAY HAPPEN BUT THAT DOESN'T

03:04:02.532 --> 03:04:06.135 region:rollup2
MEAN THAT WE NECESSARILY NEED

03:04:03.933 --> 03:04:07.803 region:rollup2
FEWER WORKERS.

03:04:06.135 --> 03:04:09.171 region:rollup2
THAT IF WE LOOK AT JOBS AND

03:04:07.803 --> 03:04:11.507 region:rollup2
TASKS AS SEPARATE FROM THE

03:04:09.171 --> 03:04:13.142 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE OUR MEMBERS AND

03:04:11.507 --> 03:04:14.877 region:rollup2
WHO ARE YOUR CONSTITUENTS.

03:04:13.142 --> 03:04:16.212 region:rollup2
AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE

03:04:14.877 --> 03:04:17.813 region:rollup2
TO CARE FOR THEM.

03:04:16.212 --> 03:04:21.083 region:rollup2
THERE ARE WAYS TO DO IT AND WE

03:04:17.813 --> 03:04:21.951 region:rollup2
HAVE EXAMPLES AND ONE IS.

03:04:21.083 --> 03:04:23.619 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE WORK WEEK THAN

03:04:21.951 --> 03:04:24.820 region:rollup2
KINSEY STUDY ALSO SAID THAT

03:04:23.619 --> 03:04:25.855 region:rollup2
THERE HAS BEEN SINCE NINETEEN

03:04:24.820 --> 03:04:27.924 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THERE'S BEEN A FIFTY

03:04:25.855 --> 03:04:29.859 region:rollup2
PERCENT DECREASE IN THE HOURS

03:04:27.924 --> 03:04:31.560 region:rollup2
THAT WORKERS WORK.

03:04:29.859 --> 03:04:33.329 region:rollup2
I LIKE TO SAY THAT IS BECAUSE OF

03:04:31.560 --> 03:04:34.130 region:rollup2
THE LABOR MOVEMENT WE BROUGHT

03:04:33.329 --> 03:04:35.898 region:rollup2
YOU THE WEEKEND.

03:04:34.130 --> 03:04:37.667 region:rollup2
YOU'RE WELCOME AND THE FORTY

03:04:35.898 --> 03:04:40.703 region:rollup2
HOUR WEEK BUT MAYBE IT'S TIME

03:04:37.667 --> 03:04:41.270 region:rollup2
FOR US TO SAY. MAYBE NOW WE NEED

03:04:40.703 --> 03:04:42.138 region:rollup2
TO GO TO A TWENTY EIGHT HOUR

03:04:41.270 --> 03:04:44.307 region:rollup2
WEEK.

03:04:42.138 --> 03:04:47.043 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT

03:04:44.307 --> 03:04:49.612 region:rollup2
WORKERS WORK FEWER HOURS.

03:04:47.043 --> 03:04:51.280 region:rollup2
FOR THE SAME WAGE WHICH MEANS

03:04:49.612 --> 03:04:53.382 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE MORE HOURS AVAILABLE

03:04:51.280 --> 03:04:55.418 region:rollup2
FOR MORE WORKERS.

03:04:53.382 --> 03:04:56.886 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE PUTTING MORE PEOPLE TO

03:04:55.418 --> 03:04:58.821 region:rollup2
WORK.

03:04:56.886 --> 03:05:01.123 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME WAGES BECAUSE

03:04:58.821 --> 03:05:01.557 region:rollup2
THEY'RE WORKING FEWER HOURS.

03:05:01.123 --> 03:05:03.759 region:rollup2
AND.

03:05:01.557 --> 03:05:06.062 region:rollup2
WERE ABLE THAT IS ONE WAY TO

03:05:03.759 --> 03:05:07.763 region:rollup2
SHARE THE BENEFITS IN THIS IS.

03:05:06.062 --> 03:05:08.898 region:rollup2
MADE SOME OF THE BIG CRAZY BUT

03:05:07.763 --> 03:05:10.866 region:rollup2
IN GERMANY.

03:05:08.898 --> 03:05:12.468 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A UNION THAT JUST

03:05:10.866 --> 03:05:13.936 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATED THIS IT'S GONNA BE

03:05:12.468 --> 03:05:15.404 region:rollup2
BASICALLY AFFECT FOUR MILLION

03:05:13.936 --> 03:05:17.473 region:rollup2
GERMAN WORKERS.

03:05:15.404 --> 03:05:18.908 region:rollup2
IT'S A STEEL COMPANY AND

03:05:17.473 --> 03:05:20.643 region:rollup2
THEY'VE NEGOTIATED A TWENTY

03:05:18.908 --> 03:05:22.845 region:rollup2
EIGHT HOUR WORK WEEK.

03:05:20.643 --> 03:05:24.547 region:rollup2
AT SIMILAR WAGES AND THEY'VE

03:05:22.845 --> 03:05:27.183 region:rollup2
DONE THIS FOR OTHER REASONS BUT

03:05:24.547 --> 03:05:30.186 region:rollup2
ONE OF IT WAS TO ADAPT TO WHAT

03:05:27.183 --> 03:05:32.288 region:rollup2
IS SEEN AS A MORE FLEXIBLE.

03:05:30.186 --> 03:05:33.990 region:rollup2
WORK FORCE AND YOU KNOW WE'RE

03:05:32.288 --> 03:05:35.291 region:rollup2
ENDING THAT THAT KIND OF

03:05:33.990 --> 03:05:36.993 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL MODEL WHERE PEOPLE

03:05:35.291 --> 03:05:38.194 region:rollup2
STAY AT A JOB FOR THEIR ENTIRE

03:05:36.993 --> 03:05:39.795 region:rollup2
LIVES IN THERE'S MORE

03:05:38.194 --> 03:05:41.030 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY AND ALL OF THAT.

03:05:39.795 --> 03:05:42.231 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT HAS TO

03:05:41.030 --> 03:05:44.200 region:rollup2
BE A GIG ECONOMY.

03:05:42.231 --> 03:05:45.534 region:rollup2
WE CAN MAKE THESE BE GOOD JOBS

03:05:44.200 --> 03:05:46.669 region:rollup2
THAT ARE GOOD JOBS FOR MORE

03:05:45.534 --> 03:05:48.638 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

03:05:46.669 --> 03:05:50.206 region:rollup2
WITHOUT HAVING TO LOWER JOB

03:05:48.638 --> 03:05:51.474 region:rollup2
QUALITY SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO

03:05:50.206 --> 03:05:53.209 region:rollup2
SEE.

03:05:51.474 --> 03:05:55.244 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IS A TOOL IT'S A TOOL

03:05:53.209 --> 03:05:57.380 region:rollup2
THAT IT IS IN OUR HANDS THAT WE

03:05:55.244 --> 03:05:58.681 region:rollup2
CAN BUILD A BETTER FUTURE WITH.

03:05:57.380 --> 03:06:00.983 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THIS COMMITTEE FOR

03:05:58.681 --> 03:06:03.085 region:rollup2
STARTING THIS THIS.

03:06:00.983 --> 03:06:03.986 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH A NEXT LET'S

03:06:03.085 --> 03:06:06.389 region:rollup2

WHAT'S COMPELLING ABOUT THIS

03:06:19.135 --> 03:06:21.737 region:rollup2
SUBJECT IS.

03:06:20.302 --> 03:06:24.106 region:rollup2
MUCH LIKE THOSE WHO'VE SPOKEN

03:06:21.737 --> 03:06:25.541 region:rollup2
BEFORE ME THERE'S NOT ONE AREA

03:06:24.106 --> 03:06:27.343 region:rollup2
WHERE A AYE DOESN'T.

03:06:25.541 --> 03:06:29.045 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME SORT OF IMPLICATION

03:06:27.343 --> 03:06:31.247 region:rollup2
WHERE IT DOESN'T TOUCH

03:06:29.045 --> 03:06:31.747 region:rollup2
ALL ON ONE OF THE ISSUE AREAS

03:06:31.247 --> 03:06:33.282 region:rollup2
FOR THE CLIENTS THAT WE

REPRESENT.

03:06:33.282 --> 03:06:36.752 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY OF A AYE SYSTEMS TO

03:06:35.117 --> 03:06:38.487 region:rollup2
TAKE JUST A BIG U. S. VAST

03:06:36.752 --> 03:06:40.122 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS OF DATA AND TRANSFORM

03:06:38.487 --> 03:06:41.190 region:rollup2
THEM INTO SOMETHING INSIGHTFUL

03:06:40.122 --> 03:06:42.958 region:rollup2
TO TAKE THEM AND TURN THEM INTO

03:06:41.190 --> 03:06:44.260 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE AND TO DRIVE SOLUTIONS

03:06:42.958 --> 03:06:45.528 region:rollup2
IS.

03:06:44.260 --> 03:06:46.028 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT IT'S WERE REALLY AT

03:06:45.528 --> 03:06:48.230 region:rollup2
AN UNSURPASSED MOMENT IN

03:06:46.028 --> 03:06:49.131 region:rollup2
HISTORY.

03:06:48.230 --> 03:06:50.599 region:rollup2
THEY CAN BE USED TO TREAT

THE POWERFUL TOOLS OUT THERE.

03:06:58.674 --> 03:07:02.378 region:rollup2
GREAT CARE MUST BE TAKEN IN THE

03:07:00.676 --> 03:07:04.547 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT DEPLOYMENT AND

03:07:02.378 --> 03:07:05.815 region:rollup2
REGULATION OF A AYE AND

03:07:04.547 --> 03:07:07.783 region:rollup2
SIMILARLY INNOVATIVE TOOLS.

03:07:05.815 --> 03:07:09.518 region:rollup2
CITADELLE SPEAK FIRST ABOUT SOME

03:07:07.783 --> 03:07:10.753 region:rollup2
OF THE POTENTIAL HARMS AND THAT

03:07:09.518 --> 03:07:12.321 region:rollup2
THAT COULD EXIST IN THE CURRENT

03:07:10.753 --> 03:07:13.756 region:rollup2
AND FUTURE LANDSCAPE AS WELL AS

03:07:12.321 --> 03:07:15.691 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR

03:07:13.756 --> 03:07:16.592 region:rollup2
AREAS WHERE. THIS LEGISLATIVE

03:07:35.678 --> 03:07:39.415 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE INTERFACES ARE

03:07:37.480 --> 03:07:40.816 region:rollup2
ONLY TO BECOME MORE POPULAR IN

03:07:39.415 --> 03:07:42.585 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL AREAS LIKE EDUCATION

03:07:40.816 --> 03:07:44.120 region:rollup2
AND HEALTHCARE ON WHERE YOU HAVE

03:07:42.585 --> 03:07:45.955 region:rollup2
EVEN MORE SENSITIVE INFORMATION

03:07:44.120 --> 03:07:48.224 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEING COLLECTED.

03:07:45.955 --> 03:07:50.526 region:rollup2

SOME OF THESE ARE EVEN DESIGNED

03:08:01.003 --> 03:08:02.872 region:rollup2
TO HEAR AND RESPOND TO A

03:08:02.371 --> 03:08:05.207 region:rollup2

SECRETS.

WHICH PEOPLE OFTEN DO SHARE YET

03:08:08.511 --> 03:08:11.380 region:rollup2

THESE COMMUNICATIONS FOR OTHER

03:08:17.553 --> 03:08:21.590 region:rollup2
PURPOSES.

03:08:19.989 --> 03:08:22.992 region:rollup2
IT IS PARTICULARLY TROUBLESOME.

03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:24.360 region:rollup2
EARLIER MISTER GROWTH SPOKE

03:08:22.992 --> 03:08:26.462 region:rollup2
ELOQUENTLY ABOUT THE DEGREE OF

03:08:24.360 --> 03:08:28.798 region:rollup2
INTIMACY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND

03:08:26.462 --> 03:08:30.166 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY

03:08:28.798 --> 03:08:31.767 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT OF THAT BETWEEN

03:08:30.166 --> 03:08:33.636 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES AND

03:08:31.767 --> 03:08:34.203 region:rollup2
THAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED

03:08:33.636 --> 03:08:35.604 region:rollup2
WITH THE INCREASING USE OF A

03:08:34.203 --> 03:08:36.972 region:rollup2
AYE.

03:08:35.604 --> 03:08:38.808 region:rollup2
SO THE LEVEL OF INFORMATION THAT

03:08:36.972 --> 03:08:40.276 region:rollup2
CAN BE AGGREGATED THE DEGREE OF

03:08:38.808 --> 03:08:42.144 region:rollup2
INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE THAT WILL BE

03:08:40.276 --> 03:08:44.246 region:rollup2
KNOWN ABOUT INDIVIDUALS THIS

03:08:42.144 --> 03:08:46.649 region:rollup2
LIFE PATTERN DATA. IS IN MANY

03:08:44.246 --> 03:08:48.717 region:rollup2
WAYS ON PROTECTED BY OUTDATED

RESEARCH.

03:08:52.087 --> 03:08:54.957 region:rollup2
THIS RAISES A VERY SIGNIFICANT

03:08:53.556 --> 03:08:56.392 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS

03:08:54.957 --> 03:08:58.194 region:rollup2
INTIMATE DATA MIGHT BE USED BY

03:08:56.392 --> 03:09:00.029 region:rollup2
CORPORATIONS OR GOVERNMENTS WHAT

03:08:58.194 --> 03:09:02.364 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS DO EXIST WHAT SHOULD

03:09:00.029 --> 03:09:02.865 region:rollup2
EXIST AND WHAT RIGHTS INDIVIDUAL

03:09:02.364 --> 03:09:03.699 region:rollup2

KID ON THE BLOCK.

03:09:16.912 --> 03:09:19.982 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW THERE ACCORDING TO

03:09:18.647 --> 03:09:21.584 region:rollup2
A RECENT ARTICLE IN SCIENTIFIC

03:09:19.982 --> 03:09:22.718 region:rollup2

PLANS TO USE DEEP LEARNING

03:09:22.718 --> 03:09:26.956 region:rollup2

ACTUALLY USE IN THE REAL WORLD

03:09:51.113 --> 03:09:54.550 region:rollup2
AND QUICKLY REALIZE THAT NOT ALL

03:09:52.815 --> 03:09:56.952 region:rollup2
THE VARIOUS USES OF A GUY ARE

03:09:54.550 --> 03:09:57.920 region:rollup2
THAT FAR OFF IN THE MINDS OF

HOLLYWOOD PRODUCERS.

03:09:57.920 --> 03:10:01.357 region:rollup2
I AM WHEN YOU COUPLE THE

PEOPLE'S OPINIONS AND BEHAVIOR

03:10:13.535 --> 03:10:15.504 region:rollup2
AND THESE ARE FUTURE

03:10:14.270 --> 03:10:17.072 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES THESE ARE

03:10:15.504 --> 03:10:18.540 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES RIGHT NOW. THE

03:10:17.072 --> 03:10:20.342 region:rollup2
RESULTING SYSTEM IS ONE THAT

03:10:18.540 --> 03:10:21.944 region:rollup2
TENDS TOWARDS COMPLETE CONTROL

03:10:20.342 --> 03:10:23.646 region:rollup2
AND PUTS THE CIVIL LIBERTIES OF

03:10:21.944 --> 03:10:24.847 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS AT RISK.

03:10:23.646 --> 03:10:26.849 region:rollup2

WITH A AYE TOOLS OR COMPONENTS

03:10:32.121 --> 03:10:34.757 region:rollup2
FOR SYSTEMS THAT CAN.

03:10:33.289 --> 03:10:35.858 region:rollup2
TRULY CHANGE THE WAY THAT PEOPLE

03:10:34.757 --> 03:10:37.660 region:rollup2
MAKE DECISIONS THE WAY THEY

03:10:35.858 --> 03:10:39.495 region:rollup2
BEHAVE.

03:10:37.660 --> 03:10:41.563 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY IN THEIR PERSONAL LIVES

03:10:39.495 --> 03:10:43.032 region:rollup2
BUT IN ELECTIONS AS WELL. AND

03:10:41.563 --> 03:10:44.566 region:rollup2
THERE'S A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER

03:10:43.032 --> 03:10:45.968 region:rollup2
EXISTING LAWS REGARDING THINGS

03:10:44.566 --> 03:10:47.770 region:rollup2
LIKE TRUTH IN ADVERTISING AND

03:10:45.968 --> 03:10:49.505 region:rollup2
AVOIDING DECEPTIVE OR UNFAIR

03:10:47.770 --> 03:10:51.273 region:rollup2
ADVERTISING PRACTICES. FALL

03:10:49.505 --> 03:10:52.741 region:rollup2
SHORT IN ADDRESSING THE TYPES OF

03:10:51.273 --> 03:10:54.610 region:rollup2
COMPLEX ALGORITHMS AND

03:10:52.741 --> 03:10:56.679 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES THAT ARE BEING USED.

03:10:54.610 --> 03:10:57.880 region:rollup2
TO DRIVE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND

INTERACTIONS

03:10:57.880 --> 03:11:01.517 region:rollup2
SO THEN WE HAVE TO ASK WHAT HOPE

03:10:59.782 --> 03:11:03.052 region:rollup2
DO UNINFORMED CONSUMERS HAVE IN

03:11:01.517 --> 03:11:04.820 region:rollup2

TO INFLUENCE THEIR JUDGMENT AND

03:11:08.257 --> 03:11:11.560 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORS.

03:11:09.825 --> 03:11:12.928 region:rollup2
MANY OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR

03:11:11.560 --> 03:11:13.796 region:rollup2
WITH THE CONCEPT OF PRIVACY BY

03:11:12.928 --> 03:11:15.030 region:rollup2
DESIGN.

03:11:13.796 --> 03:11:16.198 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY ONE WE'VE

03:11:15.030 --> 03:11:17.933 region:rollup2
ADVOCATED FOR HERE AT THE STATE

03:11:16.198 --> 03:11:19.268 region:rollup2
LEVEL AND IT'S A FORM OF SYSTEMS

03:11:17.933 --> 03:11:20.970 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING AND WHICH.

03:11:19.268 --> 03:11:22.071 region:rollup2
PRIVACY IS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IN

03:11:20.970 --> 03:11:24.306 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRETY OF THE DESIGN AND

03:11:22.071 --> 03:11:25.374 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING PROF.

03:11:24.306 --> 03:11:27.142 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT'S

03:11:25.374 --> 03:11:28.777 region:rollup2
CALLED A VALUE SENSITIVE DESIGNS

03:11:27.142 --> 03:11:30.112 region:rollup2
SO IT MEANS THAT HUMAN VALUES

03:11:28.777 --> 03:11:32.147 region:rollup2
ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THROUGH

03:11:30.112 --> 03:11:33.115 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE DESIGN PROCESS AND IS

03:11:32.147 --> 03:11:34.917 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD

03:11:33.115 --> 03:11:36.385 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THAT CONCEPT OF VALUE

03:11:34.917 --> 03:11:38.454 region:rollup2
SENSITIVE DESIGN. AS WERE

03:11:36.385 --> 03:11:38.988 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT REGULATING A AYE

03:11:51.967 --> 03:11:56.138 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY SECURITY AND

RECORDED AND HOW IT'S USED.

03:12:08.217 --> 03:12:10.786 region:rollup2
THERE SHOULD BE WAYS FOR PEOPLE

COMPANIES OF ALL SIZES AND TYPES

03:12:44.653 --> 03:12:47.523 region:rollup2
TO COLLECT AN AGGREGATE THESE

03:12:46.188 --> 03:12:49.358 region:rollup2
TYPES OF PRACTICES ARE EVEN MORE

03:12:47.523 --> 03:12:50.859 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT. YET IN MANY CASES THE

03:12:49.358 --> 03:12:53.028 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN VERY SLOW TO

03:12:50.859 --> 03:12:54.997 region:rollup2
CATCH UP EVEN ON. ENSURING THAT

03:12:53.028 --> 03:12:57.232 region:rollup2
THESE PRACTICES ARE IN PLACE FOR

03:12:54.997 --> 03:12:58.634 region:rollup2
CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES SO FAR AS

03:12:57.232 --> 03:13:00.135 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION IS CONCERNED WERE

03:12:58.634 --> 03:13:01.837 region:rollup2
WAY BEHIND AND WRAPPING HER ARMS

03:13:00.135 --> 03:13:03.238 region:rollup2
AROUND THIS IN FACT MOST

03:13:01.837 --> 03:13:05.140 region:rollup2
RECENTLY. WE'VE SEEN OUR FEDERAL

03:13:03.238 --> 03:13:06.675 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY REPEAL

03:13:05.140 --> 03:13:08.010 region:rollup2
EXISTING CONSUMER PRIVACY

03:13:06.675 --> 03:13:10.145 region:rollup2

03:13:08.010 --> 03:13:11.346 region:rollup2
THROUGH BROADBAND PRIVACY AND

03:13:10.145 --> 03:13:14.016 region:rollup2
AND THAT NEUTRALITY MOST

03:13:11.346 --> 03:13:14.483 region:rollup2
RECENTLY WERE ACTUALLY GOING IN

03:13:14.016 --> 03:13:14.616 region:rollup2
THE WRONG DIRECTION.

03:13:14.483 --> 03:13:15.651 region:rollup2
.

03:13:14.616 --> 03:13:17.152 region:rollup2
AND SO BY FAILING TO PROPERLY

03:13:15.651 --> 03:13:20.189 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE CREATION OF REALLY

03:13:17.152 --> 03:13:22.157 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT LONGITUDINAL OVER

03:13:20.189 --> 03:13:24.259 region:rollup2
LIFETIME PATTERNS OF THE EVA.

03:13:22.157 --> 03:13:25.527 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE CONSENT OR EVEN

KNOWLEDGE OF CONSUMERS.

03:13:25.527 --> 03:13:29.097 region:rollup2
WE PUT OURSELVES IN A VERY

03:13:27.229 --> 03:13:30.999 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING AND POTENTIALLY

03:13:29.097 --> 03:13:31.567 region:rollup2
DETRIMENTAL SITUATION AND AS A

03:13:30.999 --> 03:13:34.169 region:rollup2
AYE BECOMES MORE FREQUENTLY

03:13:31.567 --> 03:13:35.170 region:rollup2
USED.

03:13:34.169 --> 03:13:37.139 region:rollup2
TO DRIVE DECISION MAKING.

03:13:35.170 --> 03:13:38.941 region:rollup2
AND I'M.

03:13:37.139 --> 03:13:40.442 region:rollup2
SO.

03:13:38.941 --> 03:13:42.111 region:rollup2
THAT SAID IN TWO THOUSAND

03:13:40.442 --> 03:13:44.213 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN IBM READ A WHITE PAPER

03:13:42.111 --> 03:13:44.847 region:rollup2
ON THE SUBJECT TO WHICH THEY

03:13:44.213 --> 03:13:47.449 region:rollup2
SIDE.

03:13:44.847 --> 03:13:49.351 region:rollup2
TO GREAT WHITE PAPER AND SEND

03:13:47.449 --> 03:13:51.720 region:rollup2
IT TO. BREAK TO SOCIETAL

03:13:49.351 --> 03:13:53.021 region:rollup2
BENEFITS OF A AYE SYSTEMS WE

03:13:51.720 --> 03:13:55.157 region:rollup2
WILL FIRST NEED TO TRUST IT.

03:13:53.021 --> 03:13:56.592 region:rollup2
BUT THAT BUILDING TRUST ALSO

03:13:55.157 --> 03:13:58.060 region:rollup2
REQUIRES A SYSTEM OF BEST

03:13:56.592 --> 03:13:59.561 region:rollup2
PRACTICES THAT CAN HELP GUIDE

03:13:58.060 --> 03:14:01.530 region:rollup2
THE THIEF AN ETHICAL MANAGEMENT

03:13:59.561 --> 03:14:02.898 region:rollup2
OF A AYE SYSTEMS INCLUDING

03:14:01.530 --> 03:14:04.666 region:rollup2
ALIGNMENT WITH SOCIAL NORMS AND

03:14:02.898 --> 03:14:06.034 region:rollup2

INFORMATION.

03:14:15.544 --> 03:14:18.080 region:rollup2
AND ON THIS SUBJECT EIGHT I

03:14:16.445 --> 03:14:19.982 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY AGREE VERY MUCH WITH

03:14:18.080 --> 03:14:20.782 region:rollup2
IBM I'M SO WITHOUT SOME

03:14:19.982 --> 03:14:22.584 region:rollup2
SUGGESTIONS FOR YOUR

03:14:20.782 --> 03:14:23.685 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION IN POLICY MAKING

03:14:22.584 --> 03:14:24.453 region:rollup2
THAT GO BEYOND JUST WHAT'S IN

03:14:23.685 --> 03:14:26.455 region:rollup2
THE BEST INTEREST OF

03:14:24.453 --> 03:14:27.723 region:rollup2
SHAREHOLDERS AND ENTREPRENEURS.

03:14:26.455 --> 03:14:28.824 region:rollup2
AND COULD POTENTIALLY ENSURE

03:14:27.723 --> 03:14:30.492 region:rollup2
THAT AS POLICY MAKERS YOU'RE

03:14:28.824 --> 03:14:32.027 region:rollup2
DOING WHAT YOU'RE ELECTED TO DO

03:14:30.492 --> 03:14:32.694 region:rollup2
WHICH IS TO PROTECT THE BEST

03:14:32.027 --> 03:14:34.830 region:rollup2
INTERESTS OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS.

03:14:32.694 --> 03:14:36.765 region:rollup2
.

03:14:34.830 --> 03:14:38.300 region:rollup2
FIRST CONSIDER UPDATING PRIVACY

03:14:36.765 --> 03:14:40.102 region:rollup2
AND CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS TO

03:14:38.300 --> 03:14:42.137 region:rollup2
ENSURE ADEQUATE PROTECTION IN

03:14:40.102 --> 03:14:42.938 region:rollup2
LIGHT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES ON

03:14:42.137 --> 03:14:44.706 region:rollup2
THAT INCLUDES PROVIDING

03:14:42.938 --> 03:14:46.241 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS WITH EASILY DIGESTIBLE

03:14:44.706 --> 03:14:47.776 region:rollup2

COLLECTED ABOUT THEM HOW IT'S

03:14:47.776 --> 03:14:50.412 region:rollup2
USED AYE AND THEIR RIGHTS TO

03:14:49.611 --> 03:14:51.313 region:rollup2
PROTECT THAT PERSONAL

INFORMATION FROM UNAUTHORIZED

03:14:51.313 --> 03:14:54.816 region:rollup2
USE.

03:14:52.881 --> 03:14:56.552 region:rollup2
REQUIRE CLEAR CONSPICUOUS AND

03:14:54.816 --> 03:14:59.087 region:rollup2
EASILY DIGESTIBLE DISCLOSURES TO

USE USE TO COMMUNICATE AND

03:15:00.489 --> 03:15:03.859 region:rollup2
INTERACT WITH THEM.

03:15:02.090 --> 03:15:05.594 region:rollup2
IN SHORT PROTECTIONS EXIST FOR

TRUTH IN ADVERTISING INCLUDING

03:15:05.594 --> 03:15:08.297 region:rollup2
POLITICAL ADVERTISING THAT TAKE

03:15:07.229 --> 03:15:10.365 region:rollup2
INTO ACCOUNT THE BEHAVIOUR

03:15:08.297 --> 03:15:10.999 region:rollup2
ALTERING NATURE OF A AYE SYSTEMS

03:15:10.365 --> 03:15:15.804 region:rollup2
COUPLED WITH NUDGING

03:15:10.999 --> 03:15:17.105 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES REDUCE.

03:15:15.804 --> 03:15:18.941 region:rollup2
ETHICS BY DESIGN.

03:15:17.105 --> 03:15:20.375 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT BUSINESSES DO NOT

03:15:18.941 --> 03:15:21.843 region:rollup2
KNOWINGLY ENGAGE IN A MANNER

03:15:20.375 --> 03:15:23.512 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO

03:15:21.843 --> 03:15:24.713 region:rollup2
SOCIETY AND ENSURING THAT THE

03:15:23.512 --> 03:15:26.715 region:rollup2
SAME STANDARDS OF ETHICAL

03:15:24.713 --> 03:15:29.151 region:rollup2
BUSINESS CONDUCT ALSO GUIDE THE

03:15:26.715 --> 03:15:30.419 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF A AYE SYSTEMS.

03:15:29.151 --> 03:15:31.920 region:rollup2
I'M COMPANIES SHOULD HAVE IN

03:15:30.419 --> 03:15:32.988 region:rollup2
PLACE GUIDELINES THAT GOVERN THE

03:15:31.920 --> 03:15:34.289 region:rollup2
ETHICAL MANAGEMENT OF THEIR

03:15:32.988 --> 03:15:35.390 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS.

03:15:34.289 --> 03:15:38.060 region:rollup2
AND SYSTEMS THAT ENSURE

03:15:35.390 --> 03:15:39.995 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE.

03:15:38.060 --> 03:15:40.963 region:rollup2
I KNOW I GET NEXT ENSURE

03:15:39.995 --> 03:15:42.164 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY AND

03:15:40.963 --> 03:15:43.966 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY AND A AYE

03:15:42.164 --> 03:15:45.734 region:rollup2
ALGORITHMS AND SYSTEM SO THAT

03:15:43.966 --> 03:15:47.002 region:rollup2
MEANS AT A MINIMUM THAT THE

03:15:45.734 --> 03:15:48.670 region:rollup2
ALGORITHMS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE

03:15:47.002 --> 03:15:50.472 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS SHOULD BE AS TRANSPARENT

03:15:48.670 --> 03:15:51.573 region:rollup2
AS POSSIBLE. WHICH MEANS THEY

03:15:50.472 --> 03:15:53.609 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THEIR

03:15:51.573 --> 03:15:56.812 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR TO PEOPLE IN TERMS THAT

03:15:53.609 --> 03:15:58.547 region:rollup2
THEY CAN UNDERSTAND. ABOUT WHAT

03:15:56.812 --> 03:16:00.115 region:rollup2
THEY DO HOW AND WHY SO HOW DO

03:15:58.547 --> 03:16:01.450 region:rollup2
THEY INTERPRET AN INPUT WHY DID

03:16:00.115 --> 03:16:02.884 region:rollup2
THEY RECOMMEND A PARTICULAR

03:16:01.450 --> 03:16:04.686 region:rollup2
ALPINE. AND WITH THIS

03:16:02.884 --> 03:16:07.456 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY WE CAN CROWD

03:16:04.686 --> 03:16:07.689 region:rollup2
SOURCED SOME ACCOUNTABILITY

03:16:07.456 --> 03:16:08.590 region:rollup2
AROUND.

03:16:07.689 --> 03:16:10.626 region:rollup2
.

03:16:08.590 --> 03:16:12.594 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL BIAS IN SYSTEMS SO

03:16:10.626 --> 03:16:13.795 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

03:16:12.594 --> 03:16:15.430 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO LEARN AND BE BETTER

03:16:13.795 --> 03:16:17.199 region:rollup2
THAN THE MACHINE TO BE BETTER

03:16:15.430 --> 03:16:18.800 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AND TO LEVERAGE THESE

03:16:17.199 --> 03:16:21.837 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES INSTEAD OF BEING

03:16:18.800 --> 03:16:24.006 region:rollup2
LEVERAGED. BY THE TECHNOLOGY.

03:16:21.837 --> 03:16:25.874 region:rollup2
CONSIDER REQUIRING APPROPRIATE

03:16:24.006 --> 03:16:27.109 region:rollup2
VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION

03:16:25.874 --> 03:16:29.278 region:rollup2
TESTING PRIOR TO THE DEPLOYMENT

03:16:27.109 --> 03:16:30.946 region:rollup2
OF A AYE TECHNOLOGIES THIS IS

03:16:29.278 --> 03:16:32.447 region:rollup2
VERY SIMILAR IN CONCEPT TO

03:16:30.946 --> 03:16:34.182 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE DON'T DO

03:16:32.447 --> 03:16:35.450 region:rollup2
ENOUGH OF IN TERMS OF PRIVACY

03:16:34.182 --> 03:16:37.486 region:rollup2
AND SECURITY. FOR I OR T. AND

03:16:35.450 --> 03:16:39.755 region:rollup2
OTHER DEVICES THE IDEA THAT

03:16:37.486 --> 03:16:42.124 region:rollup2
BEFORE YOU JUST RELEASE THESE

03:16:39.755 --> 03:16:43.892 region:rollup2
DEVICES AND THE SYSTEMS ON THE

03:16:42.124 --> 03:16:45.594 region:rollup2
GENERAL PUBLIC AND IN ESSENCE BE

03:16:43.892 --> 03:16:46.628 region:rollup2
TO TASK ON YOUR CONSTITUENTS.

03:16:45.594 --> 03:16:47.596 region:rollup2
THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME

03:16:46.628 --> 03:16:51.166 region:rollup2
ASSURANCES THAT THEY'VE

03:16:47.596 --> 03:16:51.633 region:rollup2
UNDERGONE PROPER VALIDATION AND

03:16:51.166 --> 03:16:53.935 region:rollup2
VERIFICATION TESTING.

03:16:51.633 --> 03:16:55.437 region:rollup2
AND WHEN THE SYSTEMS DO FAIL

03:16:53.935 --> 03:16:57.306 region:rollup2
WHO'S LIABLE FOR THAT

03:16:55.437 --> 03:16:58.373 region:rollup2
I HAVE WHEN THERE IS HARM AND

03:16:57.306 --> 03:17:00.242 region:rollup2
AND HOW WOULD WE EVEN KNOWING SO

03:16:58.373 --> 03:17:01.843 region:rollup2
JUST SOME QUESTIONS TO PONDER

03:17:00.242 --> 03:17:03.145 region:rollup2
AND THEN. FINALLY AND THIS IS A

03:17:01.843 --> 03:17:04.546 region:rollup2
POINT THAT THAT HAS BEEN MADE TO

03:17:03.145 --> 03:17:05.914 region:rollup2
SOME DEGREE BUT I THINK WORTH

03:17:04.546 --> 03:17:07.549 region:rollup2
CAMP PUNCTUATING.

03:17:05.914 --> 03:17:08.583 region:rollup2
MY COMMENTS WITH IS THAT WE

03:17:07.549 --> 03:17:10.252 region:rollup2
HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR OUR

03:17:08.583 --> 03:17:10.819 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WERE LITERALLY BETA

03:17:10.252 --> 03:17:12.054 region:rollup2
TESTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES ON

03:17:10.819 --> 03:17:13.188 region:rollup2
THEM.

03:17:12.054 --> 03:17:14.823 region:rollup2
AND THESE ARE TECHNOLOGIES THAT

03:17:13.188 --> 03:17:17.426 region:rollup2
ARE DESIGNED TO BE ADDICTIVE.

03:17:14.823 --> 03:17:18.560 region:rollup2
BUT NOT NECESSARILY DIRECTING

03:17:17.426 --> 03:17:20.929 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TOWARDS SUBSTANCE THAT IS

03:17:18.560 --> 03:17:22.531 region:rollup2
A QUALITY AND BUT JUST QUANTITY

03:17:20.929 --> 03:17:25.033 region:rollup2
STAY ON THE PLATFORM STAY ON THE

03:17:22.531 --> 03:17:26.001 region:rollup2
PLATFORM. AND STUDIES SHOW THAT

03:17:25.033 --> 03:17:27.769 region:rollup2
KIDS ARE.

03:17:26.001 --> 03:17:29.538 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY ANXIOUS WHEN THEIR

03:17:27.769 --> 03:17:31.840 region:rollup2
SMARTPHONES ARE TAKEN AWAY THAT

03:17:29.538 --> 03:17:33.709 region:rollup2
THERE'S POTENTIALLY DAMAGE I

03:17:31.840 --> 03:17:34.976 region:rollup2
THAT CAN OCCUR IN TERMS OF THE

03:17:33.709 --> 03:17:37.279 region:rollup2
GRAY MATTER IN THEIR BRAINS.

03:17:34.976 --> 03:17:40.015 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY DAMAGE RELATED TO.

03:17:37.279 --> 03:17:42.284 region:rollup2
OBESITY SLEEPLESSNESS ANXIETY

03:17:40.015 --> 03:17:44.186 region:rollup2
FEELINGS OF WORTHLESSNESS THESE

03:17:42.284 --> 03:17:45.620 region:rollup2
ARE ALL THINGS FOR WHICH WE DO

03:17:44.186 --> 03:17:46.621 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE ANYWHERE NEAR ENOUGH

03:17:45.620 --> 03:17:49.024 region:rollup2
RESEARCH.

03:17:46.621 --> 03:17:50.759 region:rollup2
AND YET ONCE AGAIN BE IT FROM

03:17:49.024 --> 03:17:52.494 region:rollup2
PUSH AND NUDGING TECHNOLOGIES TO

03:17:50.759 --> 03:17:53.962 region:rollup2
CONCERT SMARTPHONE USE I THINK

03:17:52.494 --> 03:17:55.397 region:rollup2
THE MOST RECENT START I SAW WAS

03:17:53.962 --> 03:17:56.898 region:rollup2
THAT WE TOUCH OUR FUNDS ABOUT.

03:17:55.397 --> 03:17:58.900 region:rollup2
THREE THOUSAND TIMES A DAY.

03:17:56.898 --> 03:18:00.369 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO EDUCATE

03:17:58.900 --> 03:18:02.003 region:rollup2
KIDS AND PROVIDE CURRICULUM

03:18:00.369 --> 03:18:03.705 region:rollup2
AROUND DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP WE

03:18:02.003 --> 03:18:05.841 region:rollup2
HAVE TO ACTUALLY PUT SOME

03:18:03.705 --> 03:18:07.109 region:rollup2
BOUNDARIES AROUND WHAT KIDS HAVE

03:18:05.841 --> 03:18:09.311 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEM IN TERMS OF

03:18:07.109 --> 03:18:10.612 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS.

03:18:09.311 --> 03:18:12.614 region:rollup2

PERSON BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS. OF

03:23:45.480 --> 03:23:48.116 region:rollup2
THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO'VE

03:23:46.448 --> 03:23:49.284 region:rollup2
COME BEFORE AND UNDERSTANDING

03:23:48.116 --> 03:23:50.652 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY WERE DOING IN THAT WE

03:23:49.284 --> 03:23:51.953 region:rollup2
GENERALIZE THAT CONCEPT AS WE

03:23:50.652 --> 03:23:53.588 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE

03:23:51.953 --> 03:23:55.156 region:rollup2
BEFOREHAND.

03:23:53.588 --> 03:23:56.224 region:rollup2
WE CAN ALSO ANALYZE YOUR UP TO

03:23:55.156 --> 03:23:58.059 region:rollup2
PEAS IN THIS IS JUST THIS ATTY

03:23:56.224 --> 03:23:59.894 region:rollup2
GOES FOR GOVERNMENTS AS WELL WE

03:23:58.059 --> 03:24:01.663 region:rollup2
CAN TELL YOU. YOU KNOW BASED ON

03:23:59.894 --> 03:24:03.331 region:rollup2
OUR ANALYSIS OF THE DATA YOU

03:24:01.663 --> 03:24:04.466 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT PART OF THE WEB PAGE

03:24:03.331 --> 03:24:06.301 region:rollup2
GONNA DRIVE CUSTOMER PHONE CALLS

03:24:04.466 --> 03:24:09.170 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S CONFUSING OR

03:24:06.301 --> 03:24:09.337 region:rollup2
PARTICULATE. DRIVE EMAIL SIGN

03:24:09.170 --> 03:24:10.004 region:rollup2
UPS

03:24:09.337 --> 03:24:11.773 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY THE PART

03:24:10.004 --> 03:24:13.441 region:rollup2
IS MOST ATTRACTIVE TO JUST DO

03:24:11.773 --> 03:24:15.977 region:rollup2
THE ANALYSIS OF THIS DATA WERE

03:24:13.441 --> 03:24:17.812 region:rollup2
ABLE TO GIVE YOU SERVICES. AND

03:24:15.977 --> 03:24:19.214 region:rollup2
YOU COULD NEVER EVEN HAVE BEFORE

03:24:17.812 --> 03:24:19.714 region:rollup2
AND WOULD ALSO TAKE THE REGULAR

03:24:19.214 --> 03:24:22.517 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL.

03:24:19.714 --> 03:24:23.785 region:rollup2
HOURS AND HOURS SO THIS IS SIR

03:24:22.517 --> 03:24:26.321 region:rollup2
WHAT ADOBE'S DOING.

03:24:23.785 --> 03:24:28.323 region:rollup2
IN IN TERMS OF IT'S A AYE AND

03:24:26.321 --> 03:24:30.692 region:rollup2
I'M IN A LOT OF COMPANIES LIKE

03:24:28.323 --> 03:24:32.360 region:rollup2
US AND SO USING A AYE TO. TO TO

03:24:30.692 --> 03:24:34.095 region:rollup2
ASSIST THE PROFESSION ON SO WHEN

03:24:32.360 --> 03:24:36.064 region:rollup2
I AYE HERE SO I'LL OBVIOUSLY IS

03:24:34.095 --> 03:24:36.998 region:rollup2
LOTS OF CONCERNS ABOUT.

03:24:36.064 --> 03:24:38.867 region:rollup2
JOB LOSS

03:24:36.998 --> 03:24:40.335 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS THIS IS ABOUT JOB

03:24:38.867 --> 03:24:42.470 region:rollup2
ENHANCEMENT IS A LOT OF

03:24:40.335 --> 03:24:44.239 region:rollup2
EVERYONE'S JOB RIGHT NOW THAT'S

03:24:42.470 --> 03:24:46.274 region:rollup2
FAIRLY TEDIOUS IN ROUTINE AND WE

03:24:44.239 --> 03:24:47.208 region:rollup2
CAN TAKE THAT AWAY A I CAN TAKE

03:24:46.274 --> 03:24:48.943 region:rollup2
THAT AWAY.

03:24:47.208 --> 03:24:51.179 region:rollup2
A AYE WORKS BEST WHEN THERE'S

03:24:48.943 --> 03:24:53.681 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF. VERY SIMILAR DATA

03:24:51.179 --> 03:24:54.649 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN ANALYZE IT DOESN'T

03:24:53.681 --> 03:24:56.551 region:rollup2
REALLY WORK FOR.

03:24:54.649 --> 03:24:58.820 region:rollup2
SERVE UNIQUE THINGS THAT YOU DO

03:24:56.551 --> 03:25:00.488 region:rollup2
EVERY DAY SO THE IDEA OF THE A I

03:24:58.820 --> 03:25:02.957 region:rollup2
JUST AN HOUR IS JUST CAN REPLACE

03:25:00.488 --> 03:25:03.625 region:rollup2
WHAT. A REGULAR PROFESSIONAL IS

03:25:02.957 --> 03:25:04.292 region:rollup2
DOING.

03:25:03.625 --> 03:25:06.161 region:rollup2
OR SOMETHING THAT IS

03:25:04.292 --> 03:25:08.062 region:rollup2
SOPHISTICATED REQUIRES HUMAN

03:25:06.161 --> 03:25:09.430 region:rollup2
INSIGHT IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY NOT

03:25:08.062 --> 03:25:12.167 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE AND THEY NEED

03:25:09.430 --> 03:25:13.835 region:rollup2
REPETITIVE DATA. TO UNDERSTAND

03:25:12.167 --> 03:25:14.636 region:rollup2
AND GENERALIZE WHAT IS GOING ON

03:25:13.835 --> 03:25:16.838 region:rollup2
AND SO.

03:25:14.636 --> 03:25:17.705 region:rollup2
ADOBE AND AND AND OTHER

03:25:16.838 --> 03:25:19.174 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES THE IN THE TECH

03:25:17.705 --> 03:25:20.575 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY WE LOOK AT THIS AS A AS

03:25:19.174 --> 03:25:22.944 region:rollup2
AS AS A WAY TO.

03:25:20.575 --> 03:25:25.013 region:rollup2
TO EVEN LOWER BARRIERS OF ENTRY

03:25:22.944 --> 03:25:26.381 region:rollup2
SO SO MAYBE YOU'RE NOT THE MOST

03:25:25.013 --> 03:25:27.782 region:rollup2
CREATIVE PERSON IN THE WORLD.

03:25:26.381 --> 03:25:30.451 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE WE'VE MADE OUR TOOLS

03:25:27.782 --> 03:25:31.819 region:rollup2
SO MUCH EASIER TO USE SOMEONE IS

03:25:30.451 --> 03:25:33.154 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO THE

03:25:31.819 --> 03:25:34.155 region:rollup2
BUSINESS OF CREATING AD

03:25:33.154 --> 03:25:35.523 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGNS THAT MAYBE THEY

03:25:34.155 --> 03:25:37.792 region:rollup2
COULDN'T BEFORE.

03:25:35.523 --> 03:25:39.494 region:rollup2
THERE'S ACTUALLY AN OPPORTUNITY

03:25:37.792 --> 03:25:41.196 region:rollup2
TO LOWER THE BARRIER TO ENTRY

03:25:39.494 --> 03:25:43.598 region:rollup2
DID SOME THE MORE SOPHISTICATED

03:25:41.196 --> 03:25:45.166 region:rollup2
COMPUTER TOOLS AND ALLOW. THESE

03:25:43.598 --> 03:25:46.634 region:rollup2
JOBS WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE

03:25:45.166 --> 03:25:47.902 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE SKILLS AND YOU

03:25:46.634 --> 03:25:49.904 region:rollup2
DON'T ACTUALLY MAYBE NEED A

03:25:47.902 --> 03:25:52.173 region:rollup2
MASTER'S IN COMPUTER SCIENCE.

03:25:49.904 --> 03:25:53.508 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO HOW TO

03:25:52.173 --> 03:25:54.809 region:rollup2
CREATE THESE DATA CAMPAIGNS

03:25:53.508 --> 03:25:56.578 region:rollup2
ANYMORE IF YOU AUTOMATE THE MOST

03:25:54.809 --> 03:25:58.413 region:rollup2
TEDIOUS AND DIFFICULT PART OF IT

03:25:56.578 --> 03:26:01.282 region:rollup2
SO I. I WANNA MAKE SURE EVERYONE

03:25:58.413 --> 03:26:01.749 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDS IS POSITIVE PART OF

03:26:01.282 --> 03:26:02.884 region:rollup2
THIS THERE'S THERE'S.

03:26:01.749 --> 03:26:04.185 region:rollup2
THE THE PROGRESS OF THIS

03:26:02.884 --> 03:26:06.354 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY.

03:26:04.185 --> 03:26:08.423 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO CREATE MORE IN MY

03:26:06.354 --> 03:26:10.859 region:rollup2
OPINION MORE JOBS THAN WE WERE

03:26:08.423 --> 03:26:11.826 region:rollup2
GOING TO LOSE AND.

03:26:10.859 --> 03:26:13.895 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOOK BACK A YEAR PRE

03:26:11.826 --> 03:26:14.696 region:rollup2
INTERNET AND WE LOOK BACK PRE

03:26:13.895 --> 03:26:16.130 region:rollup2
SMARTPHONE YOU IT'S REALLY HARD

03:26:14.696 --> 03:26:17.098 region:rollup2
TO IMAGINE HOW IT CHANGED OUR

03:26:16.130 --> 03:26:18.733 region:rollup2
LIVES IN THE OBVIOUS USE HIM

03:26:17.098 --> 03:26:20.134 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE THINGS. BUT JUST SO

03:26:18.733 --> 03:26:21.469 region:rollup2
MANY MORE POSITIVE THINGS THE

03:26:20.134 --> 03:26:22.570 region:rollup2
REASON WHY SOMEONE TOUCHES UPON

03:26:21.469 --> 03:26:24.806 region:rollup2
THREE THOUSAND TIMES A DAY.

03:26:22.570 --> 03:26:25.406 region:rollup2
THERE SOME POSITIVITY

03:26:24.806 --> 03:26:27.108 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH IT.

03:26:25.406 --> 03:26:28.009 region:rollup2
AND I'M A AYE TEN YEARS FROM NOW

03:26:27.108 --> 03:26:29.143 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA LOOK BACK WE'RE

03:26:28.009 --> 03:26:30.278 region:rollup2
GONNA WONDER HOW WE GET ALONG

03:26:29.143 --> 03:26:32.547 region:rollup2
WITH. ME HE'S GONNA MAKE

03:26:30.278 --> 03:26:34.015 region:rollup2
EVERYONE'S LIVES IN CERTAIN WAYS

03:26:32.547 --> 03:26:35.783 region:rollup2
SO MUCH BETTER AND YOU'RE GONNA

03:26:34.015 --> 03:26:37.218 region:rollup2
SAY I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHY

03:26:35.783 --> 03:26:39.020 region:rollup2
I WAS PUSHING THEM BACK IN CLEAN

03:26:37.218 --> 03:26:40.755 region:rollup2
AROUND MAKES NO SENSE TO ME

03:26:39.020 --> 03:26:42.290 region:rollup2
RIGHT. THERE'S EXAM YOU SO MUCH

03:26:40.755 --> 03:26:43.925 region:rollup2
THAT WE VALUE WE GET OF THIS AND

03:26:42.290 --> 03:26:44.826 region:rollup2
SO WE WHAT I WANT TO CAUTION

03:26:43.925 --> 03:26:46.594 region:rollup2
AGAINST.

03:26:44.826 --> 03:26:47.896 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN

03:26:46.594 --> 03:26:49.264 region:rollup2
DO AND I THINK THERE'S SOME

03:26:47.896 --> 03:26:50.999 region:rollup2
THINGS WE CAN DO HERE.

03:26:49.264 --> 03:26:52.433 region:rollup2
THIS THE CALIFORNIA CAN DO

03:26:50.999 --> 03:26:54.369 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES OF TRIED TO DO.

03:26:52.433 --> 03:26:55.837 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S ALSO I WANT

03:26:54.369 --> 03:26:58.473 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE CAUTION THAT WE

03:26:55.837 --> 03:27:00.441 region:rollup2
WERE BURNED EARLY DAYS AND. NONE

03:26:58.473 --> 03:27:02.043 region:rollup2
OF US KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING TO

03:27:00.441 --> 03:27:03.077 region:rollup2
AND OR WERE THE STUFF FOR

03:27:02.043 --> 03:27:04.946 region:rollup2
SHOWING YOU SOME THAT STEPS IN

03:27:03.077 --> 03:27:05.847 region:rollup2
OUR PRODUCTS SOME OF THAT'S.

03:27:04.946 --> 03:27:06.681 region:rollup2
JUST PROTOTYPES.

03:27:05.847 --> 03:27:08.683 region:rollup2
MOST OF THE THINGS I'VE HERE

03:27:06.681 --> 03:27:10.551 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CAN BE CONCERNED ABOUT

03:27:08.683 --> 03:27:12.320 region:rollup2
WERE STILL YEARS AND YEARS OUR

03:27:10.551 --> 03:27:14.555 region:rollup2
WAY OF SEEING US EVEN VIABLE.

03:27:12.320 --> 03:27:16.190 region:rollup2
AND SO.

03:27:14.555 --> 03:27:18.026 region:rollup2
I I WOULDN'T WANT TO.

03:27:16.190 --> 03:27:19.627 region:rollup2
START CREATING POLICY NOW THAT

03:27:18.026 --> 03:27:21.229 region:rollup2
SORT OF CRASHES

03:27:19.627 --> 03:27:22.697 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL THAT WE HAVE.

03:27:21.229 --> 03:27:24.832 region:rollup2
THERE'S GIVE ME PLENTY OF TIME

03:27:22.697 --> 03:27:27.101 region:rollup2
TO SIR WATCHED AS THIS GOES AND

03:27:24.832 --> 03:27:28.670 region:rollup2
SAY OKAY THIS. THIS THIS IS

03:27:27.101 --> 03:27:30.672 region:rollup2
PROBABLY TOO FAR WE MAKE THE

03:27:28.670 --> 03:27:32.740 region:rollup2
STATE NEEDS TO STEP IN AND AND

03:27:30.672 --> 03:27:33.708 region:rollup2
REGULATE THIS ASPECT. BUT I'M

03:27:32.740 --> 03:27:35.510 region:rollup2
BORED I DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE

03:27:33.708 --> 03:27:36.811 region:rollup2
YET I I REALLY MY CAUTION IS

03:27:35.510 --> 03:27:38.713 region:rollup2
LET'S NOT.

03:27:36.811 --> 03:27:40.114 region:rollup2
LET'S NOT I'M LET'S NOT STEP TOO

03:27:38.713 --> 03:27:41.449 region:rollup2
FAR.

03:27:40.114 --> 03:27:43.384 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME DIFFERENT SOME

03:27:41.449 --> 03:27:44.352 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ARMED BIAS OR A AND

03:27:43.384 --> 03:27:45.653 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION AND THAT'S A

03:27:44.352 --> 03:27:46.854 region:rollup2
CONCERN OF THE W. WE HAVE A

03:27:45.653 --> 03:27:48.022 region:rollup2
COUNCIL ADOBE THAT'S FOCUSED ON

03:27:46.854 --> 03:27:50.024 region:rollup2
DATA ETHICS.

03:27:48.022 --> 03:27:51.559 region:rollup2
AND AND.

03:27:50.024 --> 03:27:53.261 region:rollup2
LIKE OTHER TECH COMPANIES AND

03:27:51.559 --> 03:27:54.862 region:rollup2
SAID THIS GROUP IS IS ANALYZE IT

03:27:53.261 --> 03:27:56.197 region:rollup2
WHERE ARE THE BEST PRACTICES FOR

03:27:54.862 --> 03:27:57.598 region:rollup2
DESIGNING A AYE HOW DO WE

03:27:56.197 --> 03:27:58.733 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE BIAS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU

03:27:57.598 --> 03:28:00.335 region:rollup2
SEARCH WE HAVE A STOCK

03:27:58.733 --> 03:28:01.502 region:rollup2
PHOTOGRAPHY SITE. WE SEARCH FOR

03:28:00.335 --> 03:28:03.137 region:rollup2
LAWYER ARE YOU ONLY GONNA

03:28:01.502 --> 03:28:04.872 region:rollup2
CAUCASIAN MALES BACK ARE YOU

03:28:03.137 --> 03:28:06.074 region:rollup2
GETTING DIVERSITY RIGHT.

03:28:04.872 --> 03:28:08.209 region:rollup2
KEY TO THAT.

03:28:06.074 --> 03:28:09.777 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE KEY

03:28:08.209 --> 03:28:11.212 region:rollup2
TO A AYE BEING NOW I'M.

03:28:09.777 --> 03:28:14.015 region:rollup2
BEING UNBIASED AND NON

03:28:11.212 --> 03:28:15.984 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATORY. IS DATA.

03:28:14.015 --> 03:28:18.319 region:rollup2
THE MORE DATA WE HAVE THE MORE

03:28:15.984 --> 03:28:19.954 region:rollup2
MUTUAL THE A I WILL BE SO WHEN

03:28:18.319 --> 03:28:22.623 region:rollup2
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT THINKS ABOUT

03:28:19.954 --> 03:28:24.692 region:rollup2
REGULATION ON DATA. IF WE'RE.

03:28:22.623 --> 03:28:26.327 region:rollup2
MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO GET

03:28:24.692 --> 03:28:28.029 region:rollup2
DATA.

03:28:26.327 --> 03:28:30.031 region:rollup2
THEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT A

03:28:28.029 --> 03:28:31.566 region:rollup2
AYE SYSTEMS WILL BE BY.

03:28:30.031 --> 03:28:33.968 region:rollup2
TO THE BEST THING WE CAN DO TO

03:28:31.566 --> 03:28:35.470 region:rollup2
MAKE A AYE AYES UNBIASED USED

03:28:33.968 --> 03:28:37.472 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THEY CAN GET TRAINED

03:28:35.470 --> 03:28:39.574 region:rollup2
ON THE BROADEST. SET OF DATA

03:28:37.472 --> 03:28:41.209 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S THAT'S OUT THERE SO

03:28:39.574 --> 03:28:42.877 region:rollup2
WHEN I WINDOW BE GOES AND LOOKS

03:28:41.209 --> 03:28:44.112 region:rollup2
AT DATA WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR

03:28:42.877 --> 03:28:45.646 region:rollup2
PERSONAL INFORMATION. WE'RE

03:28:44.112 --> 03:28:48.182 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR LIKE THE COLOR THE

03:28:45.646 --> 03:28:49.817 region:rollup2
SKY THE COLOR YOUR HAIR.

03:28:48.182 --> 03:28:50.752 region:rollup2
SIZE YOUR NOSE TO STRUCTURE

03:28:49.817 --> 03:28:51.986 region:rollup2
THEIR DOCUMENT WHEN WE'RE

03:28:50.752 --> 03:28:54.355 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT A PDF ACROBAT

03:28:51.986 --> 03:28:56.491 region:rollup2
PRODUCT RIGHT THE STRUCTURING OR

03:28:54.355 --> 03:28:57.091 region:rollup2
THE PARAGRAPHS UNDER TITLES LIKE

03:28:56.491 --> 03:28:58.359 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE

03:28:57.091 --> 03:29:00.395 region:rollup2
ASPECTS OF IT.

03:28:58.359 --> 03:29:01.896 region:rollup2
WE REALLY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE

03:29:00.395 --> 03:29:03.731 region:rollup2
PERSONAL INFORMATION SO I THINK

03:29:01.896 --> 03:29:05.666 region:rollup2
THERE'S A REALLY IMPORTANT

03:29:03.731 --> 03:29:06.801 region:rollup2
PRIVACY DISCUSSION TO BE HAD.

03:29:05.666 --> 03:29:09.003 region:rollup2
BUT WERE TALKING MY A I

03:29:06.801 --> 03:29:10.805 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY AND AND AND AND MAY

03:29:09.003 --> 03:29:11.773 region:rollup2
BE SUBJECT OF THIS HEARING.

03:29:10.805 --> 03:29:13.608 region:rollup2
THE A I NEEDS TO GENERAL

03:29:11.773 --> 03:29:15.176 region:rollup2
INFORMATION WE NEED LOTS AND

03:29:13.608 --> 03:29:17.412 region:rollup2
LOTS OF INFORMATION AS GENERAL

03:29:15.176 --> 03:29:19.213 region:rollup2
WE JUST WEEK. KNOWING WHO YOU

03:29:17.412 --> 03:29:21.416 region:rollup2
ARE IS IRRELEVANT TO TRAINING A

03:29:19.213 --> 03:29:22.483 region:rollup2
AYE. UNLESS I WAS TRYING TO

03:29:21.416 --> 03:29:24.318 region:rollup2
TRINITY I TO FIGURE OUT WHO YOU

03:29:22.483 --> 03:29:25.887 region:rollup2
WERE IN WHICH CASE IS VERY

03:29:24.318 --> 03:29:27.355 region:rollup2
RELEVANT RIGHT.

03:29:25.887 --> 03:29:28.656 region:rollup2
AND I SAY THAT I SAY THAT IS A

03:29:27.355 --> 03:29:29.690 region:rollup2
JOKE BECAUSE IT'S REALLY

03:29:28.656 --> 03:29:30.992 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT YOU

03:29:29.690 --> 03:29:32.960 region:rollup2
OFFER A LOT OF THE BAD EXAMPLES

03:29:30.992 --> 03:29:36.631 region:rollup2
OF OF BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION

03:29:32.960 --> 03:29:38.900 region:rollup2
AND AND AND AND STATE MAYBE.

03:29:36.631 --> 03:29:40.034 region:rollup2
STATE OVERREGULATION.

03:29:38.900 --> 03:29:41.602 region:rollup2
THIS MAY BE SHOCKING EVER IN

03:29:40.034 --> 03:29:43.304 region:rollup2
HERE BUT THAT ALREADY EXIST

03:29:41.602 --> 03:29:45.840 region:rollup2
TODAY RIGHT ON THE BLACK WOMAN

03:29:43.304 --> 03:29:47.375 region:rollup2
GETTING STOPPED BY THE POLICE.

03:29:45.840 --> 03:29:49.243 region:rollup2
ALREADY HAPPENS TODAY RIGHT THE

03:29:47.375 --> 03:29:51.913 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION IN THE BIAS THAT

03:29:49.243 --> 03:29:53.915 region:rollup2
EXISTS TODAY IT IN AN A. EYES IS

03:29:51.913 --> 03:29:55.383 region:rollup2
IS A RESULT OF SYSTEMIC BIAS

03:29:53.915 --> 03:29:57.218 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALREADY PRESENT RIGHT.

03:29:55.383 --> 03:29:59.387 region:rollup2
THAT IF A HOUSING OFFICIAL

03:29:57.218 --> 03:30:01.556 region:rollup2
CREATING A AYE AND SAYS I'M ONLY

03:29:59.387 --> 03:30:02.390 region:rollup2
GONNA GIVE OUT LOANS TO CERTAIN

03:30:01.556 --> 03:30:04.592 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S RACE BECAUSE OF THEIR

03:30:02.390 --> 03:30:05.226 region:rollup2
PROFILE. AND THAT YEAH I LEARNED

03:30:04.592 --> 03:30:06.127 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE OF THE DATA IT WAS

03:30:05.226 --> 03:30:08.095 region:rollup2
FIVE.

03:30:06.127 --> 03:30:09.597 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND SO.

03:30:08.095 --> 03:30:12.066 region:rollup2
WE NEED THAT MEANS REALLY SMART

03:30:09.597 --> 03:30:13.234 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE INSTITUTIONS WEB

03:30:12.066 --> 03:30:15.169 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION MATTERS

03:30:13.234 --> 03:30:17.638 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY FOR THE STATE'S.

03:30:15.169 --> 03:30:18.639 region:rollup2
AND WE ALREADY ARE.

03:30:17.638 --> 03:30:20.308 region:rollup2
AWARE OF THAT WE ARE TO HAVE

03:30:18.639 --> 03:30:23.177 region:rollup2
LAWS.

03:30:20.308 --> 03:30:24.412 region:rollup2
IN THOSE INDUSTRIES TO ENSURE

03:30:23.177 --> 03:30:25.680 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS NOT DISCRIMINATION

03:30:24.412 --> 03:30:27.248 region:rollup2
NAKED DISPROPORTIONATE AFFECT

03:30:25.680 --> 03:30:29.383 region:rollup2
SOMEONE TRYING TO GET A LOAN

03:30:27.248 --> 03:30:30.718 region:rollup2
TRYING TO RENT A HOUSE. AND SO

03:30:29.383 --> 03:30:32.420 region:rollup2
THE PLACES WHERE WE'VE ALREADY

03:30:30.718 --> 03:30:33.888 region:rollup2
FELT THE NEED TO REGULATE ARE

03:30:32.420 --> 03:30:35.122 region:rollup2
PROBABLY PLACES WE'RE GOING TO

03:30:33.888 --> 03:30:36.724 region:rollup2
NEED TO GO IN AND MAKE SURE THAT

03:30:35.122 --> 03:30:39.160 region:rollup2
THE DATA SAID STARTING TRAINED.

03:30:36.724 --> 03:30:39.660 region:rollup2
EYES THAT ARE MAKING DECISIONS

03:30:39.160 --> 03:30:40.495 region:rollup2
ARE DIVERSE

03:30:39.660 --> 03:30:42.396 region:rollup2
YOU MAY HAVE TO PUT YOUR THUMB

03:30:40.495 --> 03:30:44.265 region:rollup2
ON THE SCALE AND SAY LET'S MAKE

03:30:42.396 --> 03:30:45.733 region:rollup2
SURE WE OVER CORRECT HERE

03:30:44.265 --> 03:30:46.901 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF YOU JUST TAKE THE

03:30:45.733 --> 03:30:48.703 region:rollup2
REGULAR DATA WE MEAN UP WITH

03:30:46.901 --> 03:30:49.203 region:rollup2
BIAS RESULTS. BUT I THINK WE ARE

03:30:48.703 --> 03:30:50.705 region:rollup2
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THOSE

03:30:49.203 --> 03:30:51.873 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES ARE IT'S NOT EVERY

03:30:50.705 --> 03:30:54.075 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY.

03:30:51.873 --> 03:30:56.177 region:rollup2
IF THIS IF CHINA WANTS TO GO

03:30:54.075 --> 03:30:56.744 region:rollup2
AHEAD AND AND MINOR ITS PEOPLE

03:30:56.177 --> 03:30:57.712 region:rollup2
IT'S ALREADY MONITORING ITS

03:30:56.744 --> 03:30:58.713 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

03:30:57.712 --> 03:31:00.314 region:rollup2
IT'S ALREADY DOING THAT RIGHT

03:30:58.713 --> 03:31:02.450 region:rollup2
NOW A EYES A TOOL IT'S GOING TO

03:31:00.314 --> 03:31:04.318 region:rollup2
MAKE IT BETTER AT IT. BUT AGAIN

03:31:02.450 --> 03:31:05.319 region:rollup2
A EYES TO TOOL.

03:31:04.318 --> 03:31:06.454 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STOP CHINA

03:31:05.319 --> 03:31:07.989 region:rollup2
FROM MONITORING ITS PEOPLE IF

03:31:06.454 --> 03:31:09.090 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IN

03:31:07.989 --> 03:31:11.058 region:rollup2
AND AND HAVE THESE PROFILES

03:31:09.090 --> 03:31:12.426 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO AGAIN SOME OF THIS IS

03:31:11.058 --> 03:31:13.995 region:rollup2
THE MOTIVATION OF THE ACTOR. AND

03:31:12.426 --> 03:31:15.096 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH

03:31:13.995 --> 03:31:16.831 region:rollup2
THE MOTIVATION THE ACCURATE WE

03:31:15.096 --> 03:31:18.766 region:rollup2
HAVE ALL THIS TIME AND AS WITH

03:31:16.831 --> 03:31:21.068 region:rollup2
THE OTHER IS IN PLACE AND VERY

03:31:18.766 --> 03:31:22.236 region:rollup2
MAJOR ROLE BECAUSE THE D. BIASES

03:31:21.068 --> 03:31:23.971 region:rollup2
COULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE

03:31:22.236 --> 03:31:24.605 region:rollup2
OF THE THE WAY THAT THE

03:31:23.971 --> 03:31:26.607 region:rollup2
ALGORITHM IS.

03:31:24.605 --> 03:31:28.276 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTED OR A BEING WRITTEN

03:31:26.607 --> 03:31:30.478 region:rollup2
RIGHT IS IN THAT PART OF THE.

03:31:28.276 --> 03:31:32.880 region:rollup2
EQUATION AS WELL RIGHT AND I

03:31:30.478 --> 03:31:35.850 region:rollup2
THINK I'M JUST A OUTSIDE OF

03:31:32.880 --> 03:31:37.018 region:rollup2
ELECTRONS IN YOUR UNDERGRAD AND.

03:31:35.850 --> 03:31:37.351 region:rollup2
CAN A PATENT LAWYER WITH LAW

03:31:37.018 --> 03:31:37.852 region:rollup2
SCHOOL ANYWAY.

03:31:37.351 --> 03:31:39.954 region:rollup2
.

03:31:37.852 --> 03:31:40.788 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S NO ALGORITHMS I JUST

03:31:39.954 --> 03:31:43.024 region:rollup2
MIGHT THROW THAT OUT THERE.

03:31:40.788 --> 03:31:44.225 region:rollup2
WHAT WITH THE WAY THAT?

03:31:43.024 --> 03:31:44.926 region:rollup2
A AND I THINK SOME OUR

03:31:44.225 --> 03:31:47.628 region:rollup2
PANELISTS BEFORE.

03:31:44.926 --> 03:31:49.564 region:rollup2
CORRECTLY DESCRIBED AS THE WAY

03:31:47.628 --> 03:31:51.199 region:rollup2
I WORKS IS ASSISTANCE FEEDBACK

03:31:49.564 --> 03:31:53.034 region:rollup2
LOOP THERE'S IS A MODEL OF.

03:31:51.199 --> 03:31:54.902 region:rollup2
FILTER WILL CALL IN THE STATE

03:31:53.034 --> 03:31:56.170 region:rollup2
CONTENDS IT'S LIKE YOUR BRAIN

03:31:54.902 --> 03:31:58.439 region:rollup2
IT'S NO THAT COMPLICATED. AND

03:31:56.170 --> 03:31:59.407 region:rollup2
WE JUST PUT A BUNCH OF DATA AND

03:31:58.439 --> 03:32:01.075 region:rollup2
WE SAY HERE'S BUT THE CATS

03:31:59.407 --> 03:32:02.476 region:rollup2
CATS CATS CATS CATS AND THEN IT

03:32:01.075 --> 03:32:04.178 region:rollup2
SAYS OKAY I CAN RECOGNIZE CATS.

03:32:02.476 --> 03:32:06.080 region:rollup2
WE PUT SOME DOGS AND CATS AND

03:32:04.178 --> 03:32:08.049 region:rollup2
DOGS TO GET THAT AND THEN THE

03:32:06.080 --> 03:32:10.851 region:rollup2
MAGIC OF A AYE IS YOU THROW

03:32:08.049 --> 03:32:12.086 region:rollup2
HORSE AND THERE'S AGO IT'S NOT

03:32:10.851 --> 03:32:12.720 region:rollup2
GONNA DIE THINGS OF COURSE.

03:32:12.086 --> 03:32:14.088 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO STE EIGHTEEN FIGURES

03:32:12.720 --> 03:32:15.456 region:rollup2
OUT SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T TRAIN

03:32:14.088 --> 03:32:16.390 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT MAKES A AYE.

03:32:15.456 --> 03:32:19.293 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN AN ALGORITHM

03:32:16.390 --> 03:32:19.894 region:rollup2
ALGORITHM CAN ONLY RESPOND

03:32:19.293 --> 03:32:20.528 region:rollup2
EXACTLY TO WHAT YOU TRAINED IN

03:32:19.894 --> 03:32:22.630 region:rollup2
NONE.

03:32:20.528 --> 03:32:24.599 region:rollup2
SO THAT THROUGH THE BIAS ISN'T

03:32:22.630 --> 03:32:27.068 region:rollup2
IN CONSTRUCTING THE MODEL.

03:32:24.599 --> 03:32:28.869 region:rollup2
THE BIASES IN THE DATA NINE SO

03:32:27.068 --> 03:32:30.304 region:rollup2
IF IF I FEED IN A AYE AND ALL I

03:32:28.869 --> 03:32:31.906 region:rollup2
GET IS CATS.

03:32:30.304 --> 03:32:33.140 region:rollup2
IT LOOKS OF A DOG IN NEW THE SAY

03:32:31.906 --> 03:32:35.443 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS YOU

03:32:33.140 --> 03:32:36.544 region:rollup2
KNOW SO I SAY. YOU KNOW JUST DID

03:32:35.443 --> 03:32:38.646 region:rollup2
TO GIVE MY LENDING EXAMPLE OF I

03:32:36.544 --> 03:32:40.381 region:rollup2
SAY THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:32:38.646 --> 03:32:41.816 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY CREDIT WHERE THE

03:32:40.381 --> 03:32:43.217 region:rollup2
ARE YOU KNOW WHITE MALES WHO ARE

03:32:41.816 --> 03:32:45.453 region:rollup2
OVER FIFTY.

03:32:43.217 --> 03:32:46.821 region:rollup2
AND AFTER AMERICAN PERSON

03:32:45.453 --> 03:32:48.356 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE TRY SUPPLY THEY'RE

03:32:46.821 --> 03:32:50.024 region:rollup2
GONNA SAY NO RIGHT YOU CAN SEE

03:32:48.356 --> 03:32:51.125 region:rollup2
ALL THE DATA TELLS ME THAT THE

03:32:50.024 --> 03:32:52.293 region:rollup2
ONLY PEOPLE WHO OR GOOD CREDIT

03:32:51.125 --> 03:32:52.860 region:rollup2
RISK ARE THESE OTHER PEOPLE

03:32:52.293 --> 03:32:53.394 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND SO IT'S ABOUT THE

03:32:52.860 --> 03:32:54.729 region:rollup2
DATA.

03:32:53.394 --> 03:32:56.664 region:rollup2
IS ACTUALLY NOT ABOUT HOW YOU

03:32:54.729 --> 03:32:57.765 region:rollup2
CREATED THE A AYE IT'S ABOUT THE

03:32:56.664 --> 03:32:58.866 region:rollup2
DATA YOU FED THE A AYE AYE

03:32:57.765 --> 03:33:00.801 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY HE SAID YOU KNOW THE

03:32:58.866 --> 03:33:02.036 region:rollup2
BROADER THAT THE DATABASES THAT

03:33:00.801 --> 03:33:04.305 region:rollup2
THAT MORE ACCURATE ISN'T THE

03:33:02.036 --> 03:33:05.273 region:rollup2
MORE JUST NOT DISCRIMINATORY THE

03:33:04.305 --> 03:33:06.641 region:rollup2
THE THE IMPACT WILL BE.

03:33:05.273 --> 03:33:08.042 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY AND I ALSO SAID YOU

03:33:06.641 --> 03:33:09.810 region:rollup2
KNOW FOR CANDOR RIGHT THERE SOME

03:33:08.042 --> 03:33:11.679 region:rollup2
PLACES WERE BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN

03:33:09.810 --> 03:33:13.214 region:rollup2
SYSTEMIC BIAS. YOU'RE NOT GONNA

03:33:11.679 --> 03:33:15.216 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT DATA RIGHT YOU'RE NOT

03:33:13.214 --> 03:33:17.218 region:rollup2
GONNA GET THE MAGIC THAT DATA UP

03:33:15.216 --> 03:33:19.220 region:rollup2
ABOUT PEOPLE HAVING GREAT CREDIT

03:33:17.218 --> 03:33:19.487 region:rollup2
SCORES WHO WERE OR MINORITIES

03:33:19.220 --> 03:33:20.688 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

03:33:19.487 --> 03:33:21.956 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SYSTEMICALLY MAYBE THEY

03:33:20.688 --> 03:33:22.890 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN DISENFRANCHISED THEY

03:33:21.956 --> 03:33:23.724 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE GREAT CREDIT SCORES

03:33:22.890 --> 03:33:25.993 region:rollup2
AS YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A DAY

03:33:23.724 --> 03:33:27.628 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK TODAY

03:33:25.993 --> 03:33:28.195 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE YOU ARE DOING TODAY.

03:33:27.628 --> 03:33:29.697 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR THUMBS

03:33:28.195 --> 03:33:32.366 region:rollup2
GALLONS AND MAKE SURE THAT THE

03:33:29.697 --> 03:33:33.968 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES ARE ARE ON OUR UNBIASED

03:33:32.366 --> 03:33:35.536 region:rollup2
THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THAT.

03:33:33.968 --> 03:33:37.071 region:rollup2
THE SIMPLEST WAY AYE UNLIKE SOME

03:33:35.536 --> 03:33:38.539 region:rollup2
THE THINGS EFFORT IS TESTING YOU

03:33:37.071 --> 03:33:40.141 region:rollup2
CAN TEST THESE ALGORITHMS YOU

03:33:38.539 --> 03:33:42.009 region:rollup2
CAN TEST THE A AYE YOU CAN THROW

03:33:40.141 --> 03:33:43.511 region:rollup2
IN.

03:33:42.009 --> 03:33:45.079 region:rollup2
CANDIDATES AND THEN SEE WHAT

03:33:43.511 --> 03:33:46.580 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GETTING BACK

03:33:45.079 --> 03:33:48.149 region:rollup2
AND SAY OKAY I THINK THIS THING

03:33:46.580 --> 03:33:50.284 region:rollup2
HAS OF SYSTEMIC BIAS IN IT

03:33:48.149 --> 03:33:51.619 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE DATA IT'S IT'S BEEN

03:33:50.284 --> 03:33:52.753 region:rollup2

IF THE INFORMATION OVERLOAD BUT.

03:33:57.391 --> 03:34:00.728 region:rollup2

INTO FORTUNATELY OR

03:34:09.070 --> 03:34:11.005 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS ONLY THE

03:34:09.870 --> 03:34:12.606 region:rollup2
BEGINNING I THINK BECAUSE I'M

03:34:11.005 --> 03:34:14.775 region:rollup2
HOPEFUL THAT. THIS IS ONLY THE

03:34:12.606 --> 03:34:16.677 region:rollup2
BEGINNING OF A DIALOGUE THAT'S

03:34:14.775 --> 03:34:18.312 region:rollup2
GONNA NOW CONTINUE ON AND I HOPE

03:34:16.677 --> 03:34:20.081 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ALL OF YOU WILL BE PART

03:34:18.312 --> 03:34:20.581 region:rollup2
OF THAT DISCUSSION AS WELL AS WE

03:34:20.081 --> 03:34:23.217 region:rollup2
GO. SO.

03:34:20.581 --> 03:34:24.652 region:rollup2
WE DO WE ARE BUT I DID WANT TO

03:34:23.217 --> 03:34:26.120 region:rollup2
ASK ONE MORE QUESTION AND THAT

03:34:24.652 --> 03:34:28.723 region:rollup2
IS I THINK THREE OF THE

03:34:26.120 --> 03:34:30.591 region:rollup2
PRESENTERS THEM THEY MADE

03:34:28.723 --> 03:34:32.460 region:rollup2
MENTION OF THE WORD ETHICS AND I

03:34:30.591 --> 03:34:34.328 region:rollup2
THINK THAT. KIND THAT

03:34:32.460 --> 03:34:36.764 region:rollup2
UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF

03:34:34.328 --> 03:34:39.834 region:rollup2
ETHICS THAT.

03:34:36.764 --> 03:34:40.968 region:rollup2
AS PART OF THE EQUATION SO MY

03:34:39.834 --> 03:34:42.269 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE BEST

03:34:40.968 --> 03:34:43.337 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO TO INCORPORATE THAT.

03:34:42.269 --> 03:34:44.605 region:rollup2
DE DE ETHICS A PIECE INTO THE

03:34:43.337 --> 03:34:46.874 region:rollup2
EQUATION A WHETHER IT IS SO YOU

03:34:44.605 --> 03:34:48.909 region:rollup2
KNOW SHOULD WE PUT IT AS PART OF

03:34:46.874 --> 03:34:50.978 region:rollup2
THE COMPUTER SCIENCE A PROGRAM

03:34:48.909 --> 03:34:52.980 region:rollup2
OR SHOULD WE MAKE IT PART OF

03:34:50.978 --> 03:34:55.683 region:rollup2
THAT THE TRAINING FOR WORKERS

03:34:52.980 --> 03:34:57.551 region:rollup2
AND AND VARIOUS COMPANIES AND

03:34:55.683 --> 03:34:59.587 region:rollup2
THE LIKE AND WHAT IS THE. I MEAN

03:34:57.551 --> 03:35:03.257 region:rollup2
IS THERE ONE.

03:34:59.587 --> 03:35:08.195 region:rollup2
EASY THERE'S NO EASY WAY BUT

03:35:03.257 --> 03:35:11.999 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT WOULD BE. WHAT WE WOULD

03:35:08.195 --> 03:35:14.735 region:rollup2
BE SOME IDEAL APPROACHES SAID IT

03:35:11.999 --> 03:35:15.002 region:rollup2
TO INCORPORATE ETHICS INTO THE

03:35:14.735 --> 03:35:16.404 region:rollup2
EQUATION?

03:35:15.002 --> 03:35:17.371 region:rollup2
ANYONE.

03:35:16.404 --> 03:35:18.172 region:rollup2
OH I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT JR.

03:35:17.371 --> 03:35:19.373 region:rollup2
MOST INTERNET COMPANIES THAT I

03:35:18.172 --> 03:35:20.007 region:rollup2
SPEAK WITH HAVE THEIR OWN ETHICS

03:35:19.373 --> 03:35:21.142 region:rollup2
PANELS OKAY OF S. OF OUTSIDE

03:35:20.007 --> 03:35:21.675 region:rollup2
EXPERTS NOW THESE ARE PEOPLE

03:35:21.142 --> 03:35:21.976 region:rollup2
COMPENSATED BY THE DIGITAL

03:35:21.675 --> 03:35:22.643 region:rollup2
COMPANIES.

03:35:21.976 --> 03:35:23.544 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD START AND

03:35:22.643 --> 03:35:24.178 region:rollup2
I THINK I WANT TO APPLAUD THE

03:35:23.544 --> 03:35:24.845 region:rollup2
LIKES OF GOOGLE AND OTHERS FOR

03:35:24.178 --> 03:35:25.713 region:rollup2
DOING THAT. I DO BELIEVE THAT WE

03:35:24.845 --> 03:35:27.281 region:rollup2
HAVE TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT

03:35:25.713 --> 03:35:29.283 region:rollup2
WATCHDOG. AND WE NEED TO HAVE AN

03:35:27.281 --> 03:35:30.017 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT PANEL OF EXPERTS

03:35:29.283 --> 03:35:31.852 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:35:30.017 --> 03:35:33.788 region:rollup2
ISN'T DIALOGUE WITH THOSE

03:35:31.852 --> 03:35:35.956 region:rollup2
PANELS AND THIS COULD BE.

03:35:33.788 --> 03:35:37.324 region:rollup2
FRANKLY CONFIDENTIAL BECAUSE

03:35:35.956 --> 03:35:38.425 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE IS THE RISK OF

03:35:37.324 --> 03:35:41.662 region:rollup2
AND I'M A BUSINESS PROFESSOR SO

03:35:38.425 --> 03:35:41.662 region:rollup2
ALL BE VERY OPEN IN MY OWN BIAS

03:35:41.729 --> 03:35:45.099 region:rollup2
COMPANIES LIKE ADOBE AND OTHERS

03:35:43.397 --> 03:35:45.433 region:rollup2
WILL LOSE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

03:35:45.099 --> 03:35:47.201 region:rollup2
IF.

03:35:45.433 --> 03:35:49.103 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW

03:35:47.201 --> 03:35:50.271 region:rollup2
ALGORITHMS A STRUCTURED OR HOW

03:35:49.103 --> 03:35:51.705 region:rollup2
THE APPLICATION WORKS IF THAT

03:35:50.271 --> 03:35:53.007 region:rollup2
WERE TO LEAK.

03:35:51.705 --> 03:35:55.476 region:rollup2
AND THAT NEEDS TO BE GUARDED

03:35:53.007 --> 03:35:56.644 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT. THOSE ARE THE

03:35:55.476 --> 03:35:57.845 region:rollup2
COMPANIES THAT EMPLOY A

03:35:56.644 --> 03:35:59.814 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS.

03:35:57.845 --> 03:36:02.316 region:rollup2
AND HAVE IMPACT ECONOMIC IMPACT

03:35:59.814 --> 03:36:03.851 region:rollup2
ABROAD BUT THERE DOES NEED TO BE

03:36:02.316 --> 03:36:04.518 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF INDEPENDENT BODY

03:36:03.851 --> 03:36:06.086 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:36:04.518 --> 03:36:07.321 region:rollup2
DOES BEST PRACTICE SHARING IT

03:36:06.086 --> 03:36:08.556 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE HEAVY HANDED

03:36:07.321 --> 03:36:10.357 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE REGULATORY

03:36:08.556 --> 03:36:12.460 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PUNITIVE. BUT

03:36:10.357 --> 03:36:13.961 region:rollup2
IT DOES NEED TO GOVERN IN TERMS

03:36:12.460 --> 03:36:15.663 region:rollup2
OF OVERSIGHT UNDERSTANDING

03:36:13.961 --> 03:36:17.198 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING ON. AND SOME KIND

03:36:15.663 --> 03:36:18.032 region:rollup2
OF CONFIDENTIAL DIALOGUE BEHIND

03:36:17.198 --> 03:36:19.800 region:rollup2
THE SCENES THESE COULD BE

03:36:18.032 --> 03:36:21.469 region:rollup2
ROTATING EXPERTS THAT ARE SWORN

03:36:19.800 --> 03:36:22.937 region:rollup2
TO SECRECY CONFIDENTIALITY

03:36:21.469 --> 03:36:24.505 region:rollup2
AGREEMENTS WHATEVER IT MAY BE.

03:36:22.937 --> 03:36:25.639 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S NEEDED

03:36:24.505 --> 03:36:26.740 region:rollup2
I THINK ALL OF OUR PANELISTS AT

03:36:25.639 --> 03:36:28.809 region:rollup2
THIS THAT'S WHAT NEEDED WHAT'S

03:36:26.740 --> 03:36:30.744 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO INSTILL TRUST TRUST IS

03:36:28.809 --> 03:36:32.847 region:rollup2
THE MOST IMPORTANT CURRENCY. AND

03:36:30.744 --> 03:36:34.081 region:rollup2
I I HAVE TO TELL YOU MOST OF THE

03:36:32.847 --> 03:36:35.449 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT I COUNSEL WHETHER

03:36:34.081 --> 03:36:37.151 region:rollup2
THESE ARE EXECUTIVES IN MY

03:36:35.449 --> 03:36:38.953 region:rollup2
CONSULTING BUSINESS OUR STUDENTS

03:36:37.151 --> 03:36:41.989 region:rollup2
AND AND AND GRADUATE SCHOOL.

03:36:38.953 --> 03:36:45.392 region:rollup2
THEY THEY UNDERSTAND THAT A WE

03:36:41.989 --> 03:36:45.893 region:rollup2
ARE TO. A CUSTOMER THAT DOESN'T

03:36:45.392 --> 03:36:46.460 region:rollup2
TRUST YOU IS NOT A GOOD

03:36:45.893 --> 03:36:48.696 region:rollup2
CUSTOMER.

03:36:46.460 --> 03:36:49.763 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU WANT TO TRUST AND YOU

03:36:48.696 --> 03:36:51.365 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT THE PUBLIC BACKLASH

03:36:49.763 --> 03:36:52.867 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WE'RE ALL MOTIVATED

03:36:51.365 --> 03:36:54.568 region:rollup2
TO WORK ON THIS TOGETHER. AND I

03:36:52.867 --> 03:36:55.936 region:rollup2
WILL ALSO SAY THAT THAT DOES NOT

03:36:54.568 --> 03:36:58.072 region:rollup2
HAVE TO.

03:36:55.936 --> 03:36:59.840 region:rollup2
THAT DOES NOT HAVE TO.

03:36:58.072 --> 03:37:01.675 region:rollup2
PUT A DENT INTO OUR WORK GOING

03:36:59.840 --> 03:37:03.143 region:rollup2
TO ECONOMIC GROWTH.

03:37:01.675 --> 03:37:05.045 region:rollup2
I I I I WORK A LOT WITH

03:37:03.143 --> 03:37:07.615 region:rollup2
ENTREPRENEURS ENTREPRENEURSHIP

03:37:05.045 --> 03:37:09.884 region:rollup2
IS ABOUT LIVING WITH AND ACTING

03:37:07.615 --> 03:37:11.252 region:rollup2
WITHIN IN FINDING SOLUTIONS

03:37:09.884 --> 03:37:12.219 region:rollup2
WITHIN CONSTRAINTS.

03:37:11.252 --> 03:37:13.754 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THESE ETHICAL

03:37:12.219 --> 03:37:15.256 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORKS WILL BE SOMEWHAT

03:37:13.754 --> 03:37:17.091 region:rollup2
CONSTRAINING AND THAT'S OKAY WE

03:37:15.256 --> 03:37:19.126 region:rollup2
WILL WE WILL WORK WITH SOLUTIONS

03:37:17.091 --> 03:37:20.628 region:rollup2
WITHIN THOSE CONSTRAINTS.

03:37:19.126 --> 03:37:23.030 region:rollup2
OR THE IDEA THAT.

03:37:20.628 --> 03:37:24.465 region:rollup2
IT WE WILL SACRIFICE ECONOMIC

03:37:23.030 --> 03:37:25.199 region:rollup2
GROWTH BECAUSE OF SOME ETHICS

03:37:24.465 --> 03:37:27.201 region:rollup2
CONSTRAINTS.

03:37:25.199 --> 03:37:28.302 region:rollup2
IS RIDICULOUS.

03:37:27.201 --> 03:37:29.169 region:rollup2
AS THERE'S PLENTY OF GOOD

03:37:28.302 --> 03:37:30.738 region:rollup2
BUSINESS TO BE HAD WHILE BEING

03:37:29.169 --> 03:37:32.540 region:rollup2
ETHICAL.

03:37:30.738 --> 03:37:34.742 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE CAN AGREE TO ON

03:37:32.540 --> 03:37:36.143 region:rollup2
THAT SO THAT'S MY RECOMMENDATION

03:37:34.742 --> 03:37:37.611 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD ADD TO IT JUST ONE

03:37:36.143 --> 03:37:39.613 region:rollup2
POINT THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND

03:37:37.611 --> 03:37:41.148 region:rollup2
AND WE DISCUSSED IT A LITTLE BIT

03:37:39.613 --> 03:37:42.950 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. IN PREVIOUS

03:37:41.148 --> 03:37:44.285 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS BUT THERE'S A

03:37:42.950 --> 03:37:45.853 region:rollup2
SIMILAR MODEL THERE'S ALREADY A

03:37:44.285 --> 03:37:47.354 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF A PROXY THERE IN

03:37:45.853 --> 03:37:49.089 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO HAVE AN ETHICAL

03:37:47.354 --> 03:37:50.558 region:rollup2
STANDARDS FOR RESEARCH FOR HUMAN

03:37:49.089 --> 03:37:52.993 region:rollup2
SUBJECTS.

03:37:50.558 --> 03:37:54.595 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE STANDARDS FOR

03:37:52.993 --> 03:37:55.429 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS BUT

03:37:54.595 --> 03:37:56.964 region:rollup2
THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT ADJACENT

03:37:55.429 --> 03:37:58.465 region:rollup2
RIGHT BECAUSE WHEN WE ARE

03:37:56.964 --> 03:37:59.433 region:rollup2
TALKING IN THOSE SITUATIONS

03:37:58.465 --> 03:38:00.868 region:rollup2
ABOUT RESEARCH THAT'S DONE BY

03:37:59.433 --> 03:38:02.503 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL HEALTH CARE

03:38:00.868 --> 03:38:04.271 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS AND RAT. SORT OF

03:38:02.503 --> 03:38:05.706 region:rollup2
THIS UNPRECEDENTED TIME WHERE

03:38:04.271 --> 03:38:07.274 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS ENTREPRENEURS

03:38:05.706 --> 03:38:09.710 region:rollup2
COMPANIES REALLY CAN ACCESS EVEN

03:38:07.274 --> 03:38:11.211 region:rollup2
MORE INFORMATION AND DO MORE

03:38:09.710 --> 03:38:13.714 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIVE RESEARCH THAT IS

03:38:11.211 --> 03:38:16.584 region:rollup2
REALLY COVERED BY. THOSE

03:38:13.714 --> 03:38:19.219 region:rollup2
STANDARDS AND SO I THINK LOOKING

03:38:16.584 --> 03:38:22.556 region:rollup2
AT A SYSTEM THAT WAS ALREADY

03:38:19.219 --> 03:38:22.990 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED TO PROTECT PEOPLE AND

03:38:22.556 --> 03:38:23.657 region:rollup2
SEEING HOW CAN WE.

03:38:22.990 --> 03:38:24.291 region:rollup2
OVERLAY THOSE TYPE OF THINGS AS

03:38:23.657 --> 03:38:24.825 region:rollup2
A PROXY IN THESE CONVERSATIONS

03:38:24.291 --> 03:38:25.459 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S

03:38:24.825 --> 03:38:26.527 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S ON THIS SUBJECT

03:38:25.459 --> 03:38:27.962 region:rollup2
WHETHER FRANKLY IT'S ON THE

03:38:26.527 --> 03:38:29.997 region:rollup2
NATIONAL DISCUSSION AROUND.

03:38:27.962 --> 03:38:31.265 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT THERE'S

03:38:29.997 --> 03:38:32.700 region:rollup2
THERE'S OFTEN A PROBLEM WITH THE

03:38:31.265 --> 03:38:34.401 region:rollup2
FOX GUARDING THE HEN HOUSE AND

03:38:32.700 --> 03:38:36.136 region:rollup2
SO EVEN WHERE THERE'S A DESIRE

03:38:34.401 --> 03:38:38.005 region:rollup2
TO PROMOTE TRUST AND WHERE IT'S

03:38:36.136 --> 03:38:39.573 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO PRESERVE. TRUST OF

03:38:38.005 --> 03:38:41.375 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC SO THAT A COMPANY

03:38:39.573 --> 03:38:44.044 region:rollup2
DOES NOT LOSE.

03:38:41.375 --> 03:38:45.813 region:rollup2
FRANKLY MONEY RIGHT CHAIR.

03:38:44.044 --> 03:38:47.915 region:rollup2
AND SOMETIMES THAT PERVERTS

03:38:45.813 --> 03:38:49.683 region:rollup2
ITSELF IN A MANNER IN WHICH

03:38:47.915 --> 03:38:51.318 region:rollup2
PEOPLE COMPANIES TO SHAREHOLDERS

03:38:49.683 --> 03:38:53.087 region:rollup2
ARE FREE TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION

03:38:51.318 --> 03:38:54.822 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE DAMAGING RATHER

03:38:53.087 --> 03:38:56.590 region:rollup2
THAN ADDRESS PROACTIVELY THE

03:38:54.822 --> 03:38:57.791 region:rollup2
PROBLEM. AND SO.

03:38:56.590 --> 03:39:00.327 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU

03:38:57.791 --> 03:39:02.096 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT WATERS MODELS LIKE.

03:39:00.327 --> 03:39:03.297 region:rollup2
DIRE BE WHAT OUR MODELS LIKE

03:39:02.096 --> 03:39:04.631 region:rollup2
HUMAN RESEARCH LAWS THAT CAN

03:39:03.297 --> 03:39:07.201 region:rollup2
APPLY HERE IN TERMS OF ETHICAL

03:39:04.631 --> 03:39:09.603 region:rollup2
STANDARDS AND WHERE SOME SORT OF

03:39:07.201 --> 03:39:10.938 region:rollup2
