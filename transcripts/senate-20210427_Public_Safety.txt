I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL IT IS MUCH APPRECIATED AND ALSO I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AND OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. SB FIFTY THREE ALSO KNOWN AS A FLASH ACT WILL SET LEGAL PROTECTION PROTECTIONS FOR TECHNOLOGY USERS WHEN THEY RECEIVE UNSOLICITED SEXUALLY EXPLICIT IMAGES AND VIDEOS BETTER KNOWN AS CYBER FLASHING SPONSORED BY BUMBLE THIS MEASURE WOULD CREATE AN INFRACTION PUNISHABLE BY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOR THE FIRST OFFENSE AND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT OFFENSE. FOR KNOWINGLY TRANSMITTING UNSOLICITED LEWD OR SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIAL EXCUSE ME FOR KNOWINGLY. TRANSMITTING SUCH UNSOLICITED LEWD OR SEX OR SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIAL BY ELECTRONIC MEANS THE PLEASURE COULD ALSO CREATE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AGAINST ANY PERSON WHO KNOWS OR REASONABLY SHOULD KNOW THAT THE LEWD IMAGES TRANSMITTED ARE FUN. ACCORDING TO THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER 53% OF YOUNG WOMEN AND 37% OF YOUNG AMERICAN MEN HAVE BEEN SENT UNSOLICITED EXPLICIT MATERIAL WHILE ONLINE. ALSO THE MAJORITY OF WOMEN WHO RECEIVED UN PROMPTLY SAID UNPROMPTED SEXUALLY EXPLICIT IMAGES REPORTED BEING SENT THIS MATERIAL THROUGH VARIOUS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS SUCH AS SNAPCHAT INSTAGRAM LINKED IN TWITTER AND FACEBOOK THIS BEHAVIOR ALSO OCCUR OCCURS VIA DATING PLATFORMS. TEXT MESSAGES AND EMAIL IN SOME CASES UNSOLICITED SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIAL IS EVEN AIRDROPPED IN PUBLIC SPACES TO- SIX SPECTATING RECIPIENTS MEMBERS CYBER FLASHING IS ABUSIVE AND IT IS WRONG. NO CALIFORNIANS SHOULD EVER BE SENT A SEXUALLY EXPLICIT PICTURE OR VIDEO WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT AND WHEN IT HAPPENS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HOLD THOSE PERPETRATORS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR AND MAYBE WE CAN EVEN HELP THEM HAVE BETTER BEHAVE.

THE IMAGES LEAVE ANY IMPRINT ANY FEELING OF DANGER THAT SOMETIMES MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO PROCEED WITH PASSED IN THAT MOMENT. AND THE PROVIDER OF TRAUMA. I CAN HEAR IT IS DESPICABLE VIOLATION TO INDIVIDUAL ASSAULT. AS A RESULT OF THIS BY AVOIDING DIGITAL COMMUNICATION FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME JUST CALLED ME A MINUTE NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES FOR MY PROFESSIONAL ADVANCEMENT. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE THESE EXPERIENCES WITH EXPLICIT IMAGES IN THIS MATTER IT IS DIGITAL HARASSMENT PLAIN AND SIMPLE. I DON'T BELIEVE THE ISSUE ABOUT LEWD COMING UP ALL TO OFTEN IN MY PROFESSIONAL AS AN EDUCATOR. GIVEN MY OWN EXPERIENCES I FEEL A RESPONSIBILITY TO PREPARE YOUNG GENERATIONS OF WOMEN FOR THE HARSH REALITIES OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY TO SHIELD THEM AGAINST THE RELATED LANGUAGE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY TO WILL BECOME VICTIMS OF THIS TYPE OF HARASSMENT. AS THEY GO OUT INTO THE WORLD. I DO NOT WANT THEM OR MY TWEEN AGE DAUGHTER PRINCESS DARLIN OR DAUGHTER RIANA TO BE EXPOSED TO THE SEVEN ALARM. THEY SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO STEP INTO RENDON'S BEHAVIOR AS THEY SEEK TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE THE WORLD IN ITS OPPORTUNITIES. I BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT OUR GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO PROTECT US AND IN A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT THIS BEHAVIOR IS HARMFUL DANGEROUS AND IT SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM VICE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS LESLIE CALDWELL HOUSTON AND I'M SPEAKING AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION WELL WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS TO SB FIFTY THREE I'M WE RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM HERE AND THAT THE ISSUE WE MUST REMAIN OPPOSED I AM ALSO A TRAUMA SURVIVOR HOWEVER I SHARE ALL OF THESE CONCERNS OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. SB FIFTY THREE CREATES YET ANOTHER NEW CRIME I'LL BE AT THE NUMBER ACTION EPA HAS PROPOSED THE CRIMINAL INFRACTION BE DELETED AND ONLY AMEND THE CIVIL CODE. TO ADD THIS BEHAVIOR AS THE TORT. A TORT REQUIRES THAT HARM B. CREW. ANY INFRACTION DOES NOT REQUIRE THIS PROVES. A COURT WOULD ALLOW THE CIVIL COURTS TO HANDLE THE ISSUE RATHER THAN ONCE AGAIN INVOLVING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM A CIVIL MATTER COULD INVOLVE LAWYERS HOWEVER ATTORNEYS FEES ARE RECOVERABLE AN INFRACTION ALLOWS YOU KNOW ATTORNEYS AND MOST OF THIS CENTURY WOULD NOT EVEN KNOW THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO A BENCH TRIAL. I STATE THIS BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE OF FORTY YEARS AND- CRIMINAL DEFENSE. THE COURT WOULD ALLOW THE MONEY JUDGMENT TO GO TO THE VICTIM AND INFRACTION FINE COULD GO BACK INTO THE SYSTEM COFFERS. GPA IS FURTHER CONCERNED AT THE IMPACT ON YOU. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SCIENTIFICALLY KNOWN TO BE MORE IMPETUOUS AND SUSCEPTIBLE TO PEER PRESSURE. YOU TO ENGAGE IN THIS PRESCRIBED BEHAVIOR SHOULD BE EDUCATED NOT CRIMINALLY PUNISHED. LASTLY AN INFRACTION COULD ACCORDING TO CASE LAW BE USED AGAINST THEM INDIVIDUAL AND IMMIGRATION PROCEEDINGS- IN MAKING THIS BILL AS WRITTEN POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING TO AN IMMIGRANT. THERE HAS BEEN CONCERN ABOUT WHETHER THIS INFRACTION WOULD SHOW UP ON A RAP SHEET AND I AM CONFIRM WITH MEMBERS OF MY ASSOCIATION THAT IT WOULD FOR THESE REASONS THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION REMAIN.

SENATOR KAMLAGER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WAS JUST WONDERING FOR MURDER IF YOU FROM WOULDN'T MIND EITHER IN YOUR CLOTHES ARE NOW ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO THE CRIMINAL PUT PROVISIONS AND THEN ALSO- HOW THIS IMPACTS- JUVENILES IN TERMS OF- THE POSSIBILITY OF A CRIMINAL RECORD. I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS IT NOW THANK YOU- CENTER CALL MARKER SO WE HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE OF THE EIGHTY EIGHT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S EXCUSE ME AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM WE DID TAKE SOME AMENDMENTS IN THIS BILL WHICH YOU PROBABLY HAVE ACCESS TO AND SHE SAID THEY DID NOT REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION WE'RE STILL HAPPY TO CONTINUE TALKING WITH THEM I KNOW THEY'RE GOOD THEY'RE- IDEA IS TO ADDRESS IT CIVILLY- THAT'S REALLY NOT WHAT I'M INTENDING FOR THIS BILL TO DO BUT AGAIN WE WILL CONTINUE TALKING TO THEM. AND AS FAR AS- JUVENILES IT WOULD BE THE SAME WAY AS WITH ANY OTHER AT THE HELM JUVENILES ARE TREATED NOW WITH ANY OFFENSE IT AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW NO ONE WANTS ANOTHER ANOTHER CRIME ON THE BOOKS BUT THIS IS ABOUT WOMEN AND THIS IS ABOUT WHEN DO WE FINALLY VALUE WOMEN IN SOCIETY. USED TO BE THAT WOMEN WERE FLASHED IN THE PARK NOW THIS IS CYBER FLASHING THIS BILL IS TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE TIMES AND WHEN YOU TALK TO YOUNG WOMEN MUCH YOUNGER THAN ME THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY'VE BEEN ON A BUS THEY'VE BEEN SOMEPLACE AND SOMEONE DROPS INAPPROPRIATE AIRDROPS INAPPROPRIATE PICTURES TO THEM IT IS PERVASIVE IT HAPPENS ANYWHERE THERE YOU HAVE A PHONE OR YOU'RE ON THE INTERNET AND THIS IS JUST ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WOMEN ARE NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE OBJECT OF SOMEONE'S SEXUAL GRATIFICATION WE KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO USED TO FLASH IN THE PARK DID IT BECAUSE THEY GOT ENJOYMENT OUT OF IT. NOW WE KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT SEND THESE DELUDE IMAGES TWO WOMEN ARE GETTING SOME SORT OF GRATIFICATION OF IT THIS BILL IS JUST TRYING TO AS MANY BILLS HAVE DONE FINALLY TAKE AND SAY WOMEN YOU ARE. VALUED WE HEAR YOU WE SEE YOU AND WANT TO STOP THIS BE. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION. ANY OTHER FOR THE QUESTION CENTER COME UNDER. OKAY THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A COMMON QUESTION FROM SENATOR SKINNER. AS A MATTER. THE MANAGER WAS JUST A- LOOKING AT THE AMENDMENTS IN LOOKING AT THE TEXT OF THE BILL FROM. I. I WAS THINKING A LOT ABOUT WHETHER THEY SHOULD JUST BE CIVIL. AND. I THIS IS TRICKY BECAUSE IF IT'S. WHEN IT'S AN ADULT TO MAYBE THE PERPETRATOR OF THIS. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT SEVERAL MEN OUT OF A GRADE OF YEAH I MEAN SOLVE TRICKY BUT- THE THREAT OF IT BEING CRIMINAL AGAINST MAYES- IT'S NOT I DON'T THINK PEOPLE. ARE AWARE OF WHAT WE PUT IN PENAL CODE BEFORE THE ACT HOWEVER IF THE WORD GETS OUT. THAT SUCH AN ACTION COULD- FIVE HAVE THIS CRIMINAL HAS PUT IT ON YOUR RECORD. IT MAY AFFECT SOME OF THESE ADULTS NOW HOWEVER WHEN IT COMES TO JUVENILES THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S EVER GOING TO BE IN THEIR MINDS. AND I. I'M VERY HESITANT ABOUT CREATING MORE. MORE ABILITY FOR THERE TO BE A CRIMINAL RECORD AGAINST JUVENILE SENSE AND AGAIN I'M NOT IN ANY WAY MINIMIZING THE IMPACT ON ANY OF OUR YOUNG WOMAN IF ONE OF. EITHER A JUVENILE MALE. DOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO A JUVENILE YOUNG WOMAN THE IMPACT OF HER STILL IT IS IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT AGE THAT. THE MAIL WAS AND NOW I'M JUST TALKING GENDER SPECIFIC THIS COULD ALSO HAPPEN. IT COULD BE YEAH THE BOYS COULD DO TO BOYS GIRLS COULD DO A TWO BOYS ANY NUMBER. SO I BY I'M- FOR THE PURPOSES OF MY POINT. ARMS AND- IT'S. HOW TO REGULATE JUVENILE BEHAVIORS HARD. AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF RECORDS IS REALLY REALLY SERIOUS ON A JUVENILE AND I DON'T KNOW. WHETHER THERE'S ANY POSSIBILITY AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS EXPLORED. WHETHER THERE COULD BE SOME KIND OF DIFFERENT. FIVE DOING THIS B. TREE THIS TREE TERMINALS DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE FOR ADULTS I'M FINE BYE BYE PRECIADO. WHERE THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE AND I AM NOT IN ANY WAY MINIMIZING THIS I COMPLETELY APPRECIATE FOR THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE COMING FOR BECAUSE- TOO OFTEN NO MATTER WHAT ARE GOOD INTENT IS WE KNOW THE CONSEQUENCE OF HIS EIGHT. JUST GOING TO BE FAR MORE LIKELY FOR. THE ADULT MALE OF COLOR TO GET THE CHARGER THE CONVICTION THEN THE WHITE MAN- HOWEVER I THINK FOR ADULTS DID DID DID THIS DESERVES TO BE A CRIME. AND SO I JUST CURIOUS WHETHER THERE WAS ANY DISCUSSION OR EXPLORATION OF WHETHER WE COULD DO THIS DIFFERENTLY FOR A JUVENILE. BE VERY CANDID THE ISSUE ABOUT JUVENILES LITERALLY JUST CAME UP BEFORE I GOT HERE TO BRING UP THE BILL SO WE'RE ALL HAPPY TO CONTINUE TALKING ABOUT THAT. AND YOU KNOW I WORRY ABOUT ARE JUVENILES TO BUT I ALSO WORRY ABOUT WHAT THE BECOME IF THEY AREN'T TOLD THAT THIS BEHAVIOR IS NOT OKAY AND THEN DO THEY CONTINUE. TO PRACTICES BEHAVIOR INTO ADULTHOOD SO COULD WE NIP IT IN THE BUD- AND REALLY I HEAR YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT JUVENILES I DO WORRY ABOUT THAT TO A MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE TALKING ABOUT THAT. BUT I JUST. WE WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE MAN. BECAUSE THESE ARE PREDOMINATELY CRIMES COMMITTED AGAINST WINNER SANTA CRIME BUT THERE. ARE THERE ARE THERE WOMEN WHO RECEIVING THESE PICTURES AND WE'RE SO WORRIED ABOUT THIS ABOUT A MAN AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIM WHAT ABOUT THE WOMAN WHO HAS TO CONTINUALLY AND THE WOMEN. WHO HAVE TO CONTINUALLY RECEIVE THESE WINDOW WE VALUE WOMEN WHEN DO WE SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO PUT A STOP TO THIS WEEK. IN ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE WE'RE GOING TO VALUE WOMEN AND WE'RE GOING TO SAY THAT YES MEANS YES AND NO MEANS NO. WRONG WITH YOU THERE. I JUST I AM. I DON'T THINK. THAT FOR JUVENILE OF HAVING IT BE A CRIME IS THE WAY TO SEND A MESSAGE AND BECAUSE THE CONSEQUENCES ARE SO. GREAT THAT CRIMINAL RECORD THAT AND I- THIS IS OUR LAST POLICY HEARING RIGHT I'M I'M SORRY THAT I DID NOT HAVE A LOOK MORE CAREFULLY SO THAT I MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CALL OUR DOUBLES BEEN IN PRINT FOR AWHILE AND WE LITERALLY JUST GOT THE I CONCERNS FROM BOTH OF YOU SO HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON IT BUT- WE WORK WITH WHAT WE WERE GIVEN AND WORK IT ON TEAM LABOR BUT WE CAN INSTANTLY CHANGE THINGS. I APPRECIATE. I JUST WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE IN IF THERE IS A WAY FOR. THE COMMITTEE IF WHAT YOU KNOW IF THIS MONTH FOR YOUR PROCEED WITH THIS IF THERE'S A WAY FOR THE COMMITTEE PERHAPS MAKE A SUGGESTION. THAT THE AUTHOR MIGHT CONSIDER AS IT MOVES FORWARD. HOW TO TREAT AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THERE WOULD BE NOTHING IN HERE FOR JUVENILES. BUT THAT THERE WOULD BE YOU KNOW SOME KIND OF PROCESS BUT DIDN'T NECESSARILY CREATE. THAT RECORD. THEN TECH CRIMINAL FOR A RECORD. FIVE SO I'M NOT. ADVOCATING THAT THERE BE NO CONSEQUENCE FOR JUVENILE WHOLE ENGAGED IN THIS WHICH IS A DIFFERENT- REPAIR ALWAYS WILLING TO LOOK AT ANYTHING HERE ON THIS RIGHT NOW THIS MINUTE YES I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO BUT WE ARE MORE THAN WHAT I THINK ARE THE PUBLIC SAFETY STAFF FOR PRETTY GOOD EXPERTS ON THIS SO BY A MY RAISING IT HOPEFULLY THEY- CAN COME UP WITH SOMETHING AND- MAKE A SUGGESTION. HOPEFULLY YOU WILL IN FACT YOU WOULD CONSIDER ABSOLUTELY. OKAY RIGHT THOSE ARE THAT'S MY QUESTION AND CONCERN. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER- AND I BELIEVE. WE DON'T HAVE ANYONE HOMES HERE AND THAT AND THE COMMITTEE SO WELL I WOULD MOVE THE BILL OKAY I WILL MOVE IT WITH THE AMENDMENTS AND I'M GLAD THAT THE YOU KNOW I'M GOOD I'M HAPPY WITH THE AMENDMENTS AND I DO WANT TO CONSEQUENCE. ESPECIALLY TO ADULTS SAY ABSOLUTELY WANT A CONSEQUENCE RIGHT PRECIADO THROUGHOUT THE BRING IT I JUST WANT A DIFFERENT ACTION FOR JUVENILES. BUT I REMOVE IT NOW THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER- CENTER LEAVE I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION REGARDS THE- AND I KNEW IT NOW THIS IS I AND I UNDERSTAND I CAN UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS THEY HAVE WITH THE WITH THEIR TEENAGERS SPECIAL WITH THE CULTURE OF YOUR PRESSURE AND HOW THEIR BRAIN IS WORKING DEVELOPMENTALLY WHERE THEY ARE- DURING HIS TEEN YEARS- PERHAPS- A WARNING OR EIGHTY- NOT SURE. MAYBE FOR A FIRST OFFENSE YOU KNOW A WARNING SPECIALLY BECAUSE IT BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR. YOUNG ADULTS TO KNOW WHAT EXACTLY IS THE LAW OF COURSE YOU KNOW IT INFORMATION FLOWS REALLY QUICKLY- THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA SUPPORT BUT IN THE MEANTIME. MAYBE A WARNING AND- AND I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE. BUT THEN- HAVING AN OPPORTUNE TO SAY OKAY. THIS IS NOT OKAY MOVING FORWARD HE WILL HAVE THAT PENALTIES ON THAT AND JUST SOMETHING TO EXPLORE- ON THAT END- AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I. I HAVE A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SON AND- IT'S INTERESTING HOW. YOU KNOW WE REFERENCE THE YOUNG GIRLS BUT I THINK YOU KNOW SENATOR SKINNER INTERCOM MARGARET SPOKE ABOUT YOUNG MEN AND I HAVE TO TELL YOUNG WOMEN ARE VERY VERY AGGRESSIVE IN TODAY'S TIME AS WELL AND SO- I HAVE. THAT YOU KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE FROM OTHER MOTHERS AND SO FORTH HEARD HOW AGGRESSIVE SOME YOUNG WOMEN ARE WITH REGARDS TO SENDING IMAGES TO YOUNG MAN- IN THAT EVER IT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TRY TO VERY CHALLENGING TO BOTH RAISE A YOUNG LADY AND A GENTLEMAN. IN TWO DAYS TIME SO- I COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS IN IN IN PURSUING THIS BILL AND- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT ENDEAVOR. ON BEHALF OF EVERYONE WHO DOESN'T APPRECIATE RECEIVING THESE KIND OF MATCH THAT HAVE. IMAGES ON TAT END AS HUNDRED EARLY BUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU- COMMAND VICE CHAIR. AND YES I HAVE HEARD IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TREATS CHILDREN IN THIS DAY AND AGE I COULD NOT AGREE MORE- AND I HAVE HEARD THAT SOME WOMEN A YOUNG WOMEN ARE MORE. AGGRESSIVE THAN THEY USED TO BE BUT I WOULD SAY THAT YOUNG WOMEN DO NOT GROW UP TO BE RAPISTS. AND WHEN WE STOP YOUNG MEN FROM DOING THESE THINGS WE MIGHT BE POTENTIALLY STOPPING A BEHAVIOR THAT COULD GET WORSE- CURRENTLY TEAR POINT. YOU DO HAVE TO SAY NO SO IF I SAY NO DON'T SEND ME THE PICTURES AND NO ONE SENDS MANY MORE PICTURES EVERYTHING'S FINE BUT IF YOU CONTINUE TO SEND ME THOSE LEWD PICTURES AFTER I'VE SAID NO. THAT'S WHEN THE FINE IS IMPOSED- GOOD TO CENTER SKINNER TO YOUR POINT SHOULD APPROACH WRITE IT DOWN BUT I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. AND WE DON'T WANT. OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE CAUGHT UP IN THE SYSTEM WE KNOW THAT THEY DON'T ALWAYS KNOW THAT THINGS ARE PUNISHABLE BY LAW. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT OVERWHELMINGLY WOMEN ARE THE RECIPIENTS OF THESE PHOTOS WOMEN ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE TRAUMA. AS MY WITNESS. SHONA CHRISTOPHERSON ED YOU CANNOT UNSEE THESE. IMAGES AND I LOVE THAT SHE SAID THE SHOW NOT BE NORM. AND I BELIEVE BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE. THESE LITTLE ELECTRONIC DEVICES AND IT'S SO EASY TO DO THESE THINGS BUT WE- WE START INTERNALIZING AS- YEAH THAT HAPPENS IT'S NO BIG DEAL. BUT IT IS A BIG DEAL SO I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES- CAN.

TWO FORTY SEVEN LET'S RUN IT UP TO TWO FIFTY. WILL BE BACK AT TWO FIFTY. GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME WE ARE NOW BACK WITH THE SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. RESUMING WITH SENATOR. WELCOME SENATOR ALSO. THANK YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL AND SB FOUR EIGHT ONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS CHAIR VICE CHAIR. AND MEMBER I WAS PREPARED TO SAY MEMBERS BUT MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. YES I'M HERE TO PRESENT AS BEFORE EIGHTY ONE A BILL THAT WILL RETURN TO JUDGES THE ABILITY TO STRIKE OR DISMISS SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS AND ALSO CREATE A CAREFUL PROCESS FOR YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS. TO HAVE THEIR SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS REASSESSED BY A JUDGE IN NINETEEN NINETY CALIFORNIA PROPOSITION ONE FIFTEEN REMOVED FROM JUDGES THE ABILITY TO USE ANY OF THEIR JUDICIAL DISCRETION. AVAILABLE PRECEDENCE OR MITIGATING FACTORS TO ASSESS WHETHER A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE CHARGE TO AN INDIVIDUAL IS NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE TO THE CASE AT HAND OR THE NEEDS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AS A CONSEQUENCE THIS CREATED A ONE SIZE FITS ALL PROCESS. THAT PREVENTS ANY KIND OF SENTENCE CONSIDERATION AND APPLIES TO NEARLY EVERY SINGLE CASE THAT RESULTED IN A SENTENCE OF LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE. FOR VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE OR HUMAN TRAFFICKING INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL OR INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE EIGHTEEN AT THE TIME OF THE CRIME INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN ACCESSORIES OR INCIDENTAL TO A CRIME THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY FOR A JUDGE TO CONSIDER ANY OF THESE RELEVANT MITIGATING FACTORS. THIS PROHIBITION IS A RELIC FROM MY TOUGH ON CRIME ERA THAT SERVED ONLY AS A BARRIER TO THE FURTHERANCE OF JUSTICE AND REHABILITATION IN OUR COURT SYSTEM. HIS BEFORE ANYONE ALSO INSTRUCTS JUDGES TO GIVE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION TO THE STRIKING OR DISMISSAL OF SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. TO YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS THAT COMMITTED THEIR OFFENSE AT AGE TWENTY FIVE OR YOUNGER AND HAVE SERVED FIFTEEN YEARS OF THEIR SENTENCE. THE LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY TAKEN A NUMBER OF STEPS TO ALIGN PUBLIC POLICY WITH MAINSTREAM RESEARCH AND EVIDENCE ON THE DAHLE DEVELOPMENT. THAT RESEARCH IS CLEAR THAT AREAS OF THE BRAIN PARTICULAR PARTICULARLY RELATED TO JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAKING ARE NOT FULLY DEVELOPED UNTIL THE EARLY TO MID TWENTIES. THAT HAS LED TO THE ADOPTION OF LAWS THAT KNOWLEDGE A YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS DIMINISHED CRIMINAL CRIMINAL CULPABILITY. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THEIR INCREASED POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH AND REHABILITATION. IT IS APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY THE JUDGES INCORPORATE THESE FACTS WHEN ASSESSING THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE ENHANCEMENTS OF A YOUTHFUL OFFENDER AS BEFORE EIGHTY ONE THEREFORE INSTRUCTS JUDGES TO INCLUDE AN EVALUATION OF THE RELEVANT SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTAL AND BIOLOGICAL MITIGATING FACTORS AND PRESUME TO DISMISS A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES ENHANCEMENT. WHEN THE CASE INVOLVES AN OFFENDER THAT WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OR YOUNGER AT THE TIME OF THEIR OFFENSE AND HAS SERVED FIFTEEN YEARS OF THEIR SENTENCE. UNDER SB FORTY ONE JUDGES WOULD BE TRAINED FULL DISCRETION TO ASSESS ALL OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE AND TO MAKE THEIR DECISION TO ENSUREAN OUTCOME THAT PROVIDES FOR THE FURTHERANCE OF JUSTICE AND PUBLIC SAFETY. THIS BILL ALSO INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT THAT A COURT PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE SURVIVORS AND SURVIVING FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE VICTIM. ARE OFFERED INFORMATION ABOUT SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS AS THIS COURT PROCESS PLAYS OUT. THE JUDICIARY HAS A ROBUST PROCESS IN PLACE- THAT IS ABOUT TO ENSURE THAT THE NEEDS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY ARE MET. THIS BILL LET'S NO ONE OUT OF PRISON- ABSOLVES ANYONE FROM THEIR SENTENCE OR THEIR OBLIGATION TO FACE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS IN EVERY SINGLE CASE AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD FIRST. NEED A JUDGE TO DECIDE OR TO DISMISS OR STRIKE A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. SHOULD THAT MAKE THEM ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE THEY WOULD THEN NEED TO APPEAR BEFORE A PAROLE BOARD. AND DEMONSTRATE THEIR SUITABILITY FOR PAROLE AND FINALLY THE pOVER ANY PAROLE CASES THIS IS NOT A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE WILL BE ABLE TO SLP THROUGH THE CRACKS. THERE ARE ABUNDANT GUARDRAILS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THIS PROCESS PLAYS OUT UNDER STRICT SCRUTINY AT EVERY SINGLE STAGE. TOP ON CRIME IN ONE SIZE FITS ALL POLICIES HAVE NOT SOLVED THE PROBLEMS FACING THE JUSTICE SYSTEM NOR ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. SB FORTY ONE CREATES A CAREFUL MODERATE PROCESS TO ALLOW JUDGES TO EVALUATE AN INDIVIDUAL'S BACKGROUND AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THEIR OFFENSE SO THAT THEY CAN EXERCISE THEIR DISCRETION ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. MY WITNESSES TODAY WILL BE GUNNER JOHNSON A CRIME SURVIVOR IMPACTED VICTIM. AND OUTREACH DIRECTOR AT PROJECT REBOUND CAL STATE UNIVERSITY SACRAMENTO AND PROFESSOR HEIDI RUMMEL OF THE USC GOULD SCHOOL OF LAW POST CONVICTION JUSTICE PROJECT THANK YOU MANAGER.

PRISON WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE. TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER THIRTY CALIBER BULLET REMAINS LODGED RIGHT NOW. RANGERS WERE SEVERE BUT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF THE CRIME DURING LONG AFTER I HEAL PHYSICAL. CHAMA PROPELLED ME INTO A DOWNWARD SPIRAL I BECAME ADDICTED TO OPIATES WHICH I WAS EXPOSED TO FOR THE FIRST TIME WHILE RECOVERING FROM GUNSHOT WOUNDS. SO MY USE OF OPIATES WAS INITIALLY FOR MARKETS- INTRINSYC GRADUALLY BEGAN TO RELY ON THEM TO MEDICAID PARTS LIKE A LOGICAL LOOMS. I LIVE WITH THE SURVIVOR'S GUILD ON TREATY PTSD AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE DRUGS UNTIL I GOT SOBER FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. IT'S A BY THE HOURS INTO THE ANGER KERRY BOTH OF THE MEN THAT HARM. I DECIDED TO WRITE LETTERS BOTH MEN. COMMISSION NINETEEN SHOT ME RESPOND AGAIN THAT'S WITH THIRTY AMEND LETTER THAT PROVIDED ME SOME INSIGHT TO THIS TRIAL TRAUMA. DEEPER MORE INSTEAD TO TAKE TO TURN HIS LIFE AROUND. TWENTY FOUR YEARS AFTER THE CRIME. I COULD SEE THE SINCERITY IN HIS LETTER I THOUGHT HE DESERVED A CHANCE A RELEASE. THAT HE WAS GOING TO DIE IN PRISON. I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT EVERYONE CHANGES WHAT I AM SAYING HOWEVER IS THAT DURING MY OWN PROCESS TO GROW BY LEARNING. YOUNG PEOPLE WHO CAUSE TREMENDOUS HARM CAN BECOME HEALTHY ADULTS WHO HAVE A LOT TO OFFER SOCIETY. CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT LAW GIVES SECOND CHANCES TO USE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN CENTS A LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE. I SUPPORT SB FORTY ONE BECAUSE IT ALLOWS SOMEONE WHO DISPLAYS MEANINGFUL CHANGE A CHANCE TO PROVE TO THE COURT. THE PROBOARDS THEIR FAMILY JACQUI TIDY THAT THEY CAN BE CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS. SB FORTY ONE WOULD REQUIRE YOUR SERVING LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE TO PROVE WHAT THEY HAD DONE THE WORK YOUR CONSIDERATION WOULD STILL% REQUIRE. THEM TO CHILDREN IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS. I SAFER KNOWING THAT JUDGES ARE HAVE DISCRETION TO GRANT WHETHER PER DRAMATICALLY TURNED LIFE AROUND. AFTER SHE ON ON USE AT THE OF TWENTY FIVE OR BELOW AT THE- THANKS.

THANK YOU SOME FOR YOUR TESTING. AND THE BENNETT MISTER JOE. WHO NOT CONTINUE WITH. RUMMEL ARE YOU ON THE LINE. HI AND THANK YOU. PLEASE PROCEED YOUR WITH YOUR PERSON BRAD. I WANT TO PRISON BRADFORD COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR EIGHTY ONE. MY NAME IS HEIDI RUMMEL AND I'M A LAW PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I DIRECT THE COPD CONVICTION JUSTICE PROJECT. AFTER TWELVE YEARS I SERVED AS A FEDERAL PROSECUTOR KRISTEN WASHINGTON DC AND LATER IN LOS ANGELES. I PROSECUTED THE MOST SERIOUS CRIME RAPE MURDER GANG VIOLENCE HUMAN TRAFFICKING I HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE IMPACT OF VIOLENCE ON VICTIMS SURVIVORS AND ON OUR COMMUNITY. I SUPPORT SB FORTY ONE BECAUSE IT RETURNS DISCRETION TO JUDGES IN A BALANCED WAY. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY IN EVERY CASE WHERE DISTRICT ATTORNEY PURSUED A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE ALLEGATION LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE THE MANDATORY SENTENCE. BOB CALIFORNIA LAW HAS TWENTY SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. INCLUDING THIRTEEN DIFFERENT FELONIES ELEVATE A MURDER LIFE SENTENCE TO AL WHAT MURDER BY AN EXPLOSIVES OR BY POISON OR BY SHOOTING A GUN FROM A CAR AS PART OF THE STREET GANG FOR FINANCIAL GAIN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ROBBERY AND BURGLARY KIDNAPPING OR CARJACKING OR ANYONE OF NINE OTHER FELONIES. TODAY THERE ARE NEARLY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE DESERVING L. LOCK SENTENCED TO DIE IN CALIFORNIA PRISONS. SOME DID NOT KILL OR INTENT TO KILL SOME HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. MOST WERE TEENAGERS OR USE AT THE TIME OF THE CRIME. AND TWO THIRDS OF BLACK COMMITTEE NEXT. LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE SHOULD NOT BE A MANDATORY SENTENCE BASED ON THE DA'S FILING DECISION AT THE OUTSET OF THE KING. SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS RECOGNIZED THAT YOU ARE LESS CULPABLE. AND HAS PASSED MEASURED LAWS TO SUPPORT SECOND CHANCES FOR PEOPLE IN PRISON WHO HAD DONE THE HARD WORK TO REHABILITATE. NONE OF THOSE LAWS ARE GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARDS AND NEITHER IS DISPELLED. SB FOUR EIGHTY ONE ASSEMBLY RETURNS DISCRETION TO JUDGES TO STRIKE A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE. AFTER WEIGHING ALL THE RELEVANT EVIDENCE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ARGUMENT. THE VICTIMS FAMILY MEMBERS STATEMENT. AND EVEN WHEN A JUDGE EXERCISES THAT DISCRETION THE PERSON REMAIN CONVICTED OF FIRST DEGREE MURDER SERVING A TWENTY FIVE YEAR LIFE SENTENCE AT A MINIMUM. WITH THE ONLY POSSIBILITY FOR RELEASED TO THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE GOVERNOR. ROLE REQUIRES THE BOARD AND THE GOVERNOR TO MAKE A RIGOROUS PUBLIC SAFETY DETERMINATION. CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM RATE IS RELEASED TO PAROLE IS LESS THAN PUBLIC SAFETY WITH CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO SECOND CHANCES FOR THOSE WHO DO THE HARD WORK TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES I STRONGLY URGE AND I THOUGHT.

WILL NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO OUR MEMBERS- ENTER COMMITTEE. DO ANY OF OUR MEMBERS- HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. SKINNER SKINNER THANK YOU. SIR MATT WILL ACT. I. ABSOLUTELY WORKING FOR THE THAT. COMMITTEE WAS WRECKED ANY MAN. READ THROUGH. SO BUT- NO SO I WOULD. MOVE THE BILL DOWN I PLEASE THE CENTER BRING IT THE FOR US AS HEARD IN THE TESTING. THERE ARE. MANY MANY INDIVIDUALS IN- CALIFORNIA WHO WERE SENTENCED TO LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE. BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE. INTERESTINGLY WELL THIS BILL DOES NOT DEAL SPECIFICALLY FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE FELONY MURDER- FOR REFERRAL ANY MURDER STATUTE WHICH WE HAVE HEARD RECENTLY COMMITTEE WITH ANOTHER SENATORS BILL AND WHICH DO NOT A BILL I AUTHORED. ON CHANGE THE STATUTE OF A FEW YEARS AGO. A. B. A WOMAN WAS JUST RELEASED WHO HAD SERVED THIRTEEN YEARS WAS SENTENCED WITH LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE. A CRIME THAT SHE WAS SENTENCED FOR. WAS OCCURRED WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER THAN TWENTY FIVE SHE WAS SENTENCED FOR LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE. BUT WHEN THEY DID THE RE HEARING UNDER THE REVISED FELONY MURDER STATUTE THE DETERMINED THAT SHE HER. SENTENCE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS AND FOR YEARS ONLY SO SHE'S NOW BEEN SENT HOME. NOW CERTAINLY THE ALL OF THE INDIVIDUALS IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE THAT- CENTER DRAWS WAS ADDRESSING ME NOT. IF THE STATE THIS IS NOT THE SAME BUT IT IS CERTAINLY IT ADDRESSES THE FACT THAT. THERE WAS A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE. WE ENGAGED IN WHAT WE NOW UNDERSTAND THIS BEING I AM VERY- EIGHT EIGHT OR CALL IT A TOUGH ON CRIME APPROACH THAT DID NOT FACTOR. THINGS SUCH AS A PERSON'S AGE THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE SO MANY THINGS AND WE CREATED. I DO WE PROLIFERATED OVER CENSUS AND WE ENCOURAGED A REALLY OVERZEALOUS NOUS OF PROSECUTORIAL BEHAVIOR. AND THE RESULT FOR THIS WE HAVE THE LARGEST NOT ONLY RAW NUMBERS OF PEOPLE SERVING LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE IN THE US BUT THE HALFPIPE PROPORTION EVEN TO OUR PER CAPITA. THE HIGHEST LIKE BEYOND ANY OTHER STATE. MANY OF WHOM AS THE SENATORS- BILL SHOWS WERE GIVEN OUT SENSE DURING THE PERIOD OF THEIR AGE OWN BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE. SO I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CHANGE I REALLY APPRECIATE CENTER DRUGS ARE YOU BRINGING IT BEFORE US. AND AS I INDICATED I MOVED THE BILL. THIS. THANK YOU FIVE WITH THE APPROPRIATE TIME WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU. I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- FROM SENATOR DORADO- LET ME JUST BEGIN BY ASKING DEBTS. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING HERE THAT THE BILL IS CONTRARY TO THE VOTERS WHAT THE BORDERS ENACTED AND IT LOWERS THE CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR HEINOUS CRIMES- I'M SORRY I DIDN'T HEAR THE SECOND PART IS LOWER THE- APPS OR THE ONE. SO THIS BILL- HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THE FACT THAT THIS BILL WOULD BE IN CONTRARY TO WHAT VOTERS ENACTED INTO LAW WORST CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR HEINOUS CRIMES. WELL THAT WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CAP CALIFORNIA PROPOSITION ONE FIFTEEN. BY IT WITH THE NINETEEN NINETY AND IT DID TAKE AWAY- IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE SAME THING REMOVE FROM THE JUDGES THE ABILITY TO USE THEIR DISCRETION. AND I. I BELIEVE SOME MANY OF US BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A TIME WHEN IT WAS JUST A- YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE TOUGH ON PEOPLE. YOU KNOW JUDGE DOESN'T HAVE ANY RIGHT TO- USES HIS OR HER DISCRETION OR ANY OTHER FACTORS SO THAT ISNOT WORKING THAT'S OR FINING IS NOT WORKING AND THAT'S WHY MAKING THIS CHANGE BECAUSE- IT'S NOT. WORKING ANYMORE TO GIVE THE KIND OF CONSIDERATION S. AND IN SOME WAYS WITH YOUTH BY GIVING CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER AT IN THEIR TERMS OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT. IS NOT GIVING CONSIDERATION TO- INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES IS NOT GIVING CONSIDERATION TO IF YOU ARE AN ACCESSORY OR INCIDENTAL TO THE CRIME- RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY FOR THE JUDGE TO CONSIDER THOSE. IF IT'S PUT FORWARD- WITH THESE KIND OF- ENHANCEMENT SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE ENHANCEMENTS. OKAY. AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION IS SAYS- IT IGNORES. THIS BILL WOULD IGNORE THE COURTS EXISTING DISCRETION IN CASES WHERE THE DEFENDANT IS ACTUALLY A MINOR. PENAL CODE ONE NINETY POINT FIVE ALREADY ALLOWS THE JUDGE TO IMPOSE A SENTENCE OF TWENTY FIVE TO LIFE IN CASES WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL IS UNDER EIGHTEEN- WORDS HE'S CONVICTED OR SHE'S CONVICTED OF THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF MURDER. HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND. I AM A MANAGER IF I COULD- ASK ONE OF OUR EXPERT WITNESSES EITHER PROFESSOR- RUMMEL. I CAN RESPOND TO THAT BRIEFLY- ACREE RIGHT TO THIS BILL WOULD BRING DISCRETION WOULD ALLOW DISCRETION FOR JUDGES AS THEY DO WITH PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN COULD DECIDE WHETHER TWENTY FIVE TO LIFE OR LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE IS THE APPROPRIATE SENTENCE ON JUSTICE WHO RECENTLY POINTED OUT IN. THE NIGHT OF OR- THAT TELL HAS TO BE PULLED ISSUE CURRENTLY UNDER CURRENT LAW BECAUSE JUDGES HAVE THAT QUESTION A PEOPLE UNDER A AND DO NOT HAVE THAT THE- FOR AGED EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE HOME THE LEGISLATURE HAS RECOGNIZED IN AND NUMEROUS OTHER BILLS ARE ALSO LESS CULPABLE AND GREATER HAVE A GREATER CAPACITY FOR REHABILITATION. FOR THIS BILL DOES NOT REMOVE THE SENTENCE OF LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE IT SIMPLY GIVES THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION AND GUIDANCE ON WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. AND ONE O'CLOCK. OKAY AND THEN- HOW YOU RESPOND US SENATOR TO ROSTER TWO THE FACT THAT THIS BILL WILL ELIMINATE THAT THIS QUALIFIERS OF MURDERING VICTIMS WHO ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS OR FIRE FIGHTERS AND OF INFLICTING TORTURE ON VICTIMS. MAYBE IT MISTER JOHNSON COULD YOU. RESPOND TO THAT. HE MAY NOT STILL BE ON THE LINE CONNOR OKAY. PROFESSOR COULD YOU RECYCLE THE BOND BREAK ROOMS SURE IT DOESN'T MEAN. THE SPECIAL BECAUSE THEY REMAIN IN LAW AND BRIDGE HAS DISCRETION TO LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE IN CASE YOU WHERE THE SPECIAL. ARE ALLEGED. ONE TO. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. PROFESSOR RUMMEL RIGHTS PROFESSOR ROMAN THANK YOU. YES THINKING. GREAT THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS BY MEMBERS. C. NINE DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON THIS ROGER. GIVE SENATOR SKINNER OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER- WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR SKINNER DO PASSED BUT FIRST RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON SB FOUR EIGHT ONE. SB FOUR EIGHT WONDER OTHER TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS BRADFORD ON RADFORD I CHOI BOGUE NO TROUBLE NO CALM LONGER HI I'M MY OR I SKINNER. HI IN OUR AYE. MEAN THE ROLE OPEN FOR. THE MEASURE OF THREE VOTE TO LEAVE THE OPEN FOR ABSENT. NEXT UP I SEE WE HAVE COLLINS FILE NINE S. B. EIGHT THREE OR YOU PREFER FOR THAT. WITH THAT. OKAY THE MEASURE IS TODAY ALL RIGHT SIR. IT'S. IS NUMBER. ONE I DON'T ALSO. THE NEW JONES YES. SENATOR JOHN. FIVE- IS A BILL WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR A LITTLE TIME IN THE IN THE CLOSING DAYS OF THE LAST LEGISLATIVE SESSION A GRAVE INJUSTICE WAS DONE BY THIS LEGISLATURE TO RAPE VICTIMS IN CALIFORNIA. ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY TO THIRTY FOUR BY SOME WOMEN- TANG WAS GUTTED AND AMENDED TO INCLUDE PROVISIONS TAKEN FROM BUDGET TRAILER BILL AB EIGHTY EIGHT. THESE PROVISIONS WERE REMOVED FROM THE BUDGET BILL AND GET IT AMENDED INTO AB THIRTY TWO THIRTY FOUR. WHICH ARBITRARILY LORD THE AGE FROM SIXTY TO FIFTY. FOR CONVICTED CRIMINALS INCLUDING RAPISTS AND OTHER VIOLENT SEXUAL OFFENDERS TO SUDDENLY BE DECLARED. ELDERLY AND THAT'S BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY RELEASE FROM PRISON TEN YEARS SOONER THAN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN. ADDITIONALLY THE GOT THE MEN BILL FORCED THE VICTIMS OF RAPE TO HAVE TO RELIVE THE TRAUMA OF THEIR ASSAULT AT MANY MORE PAROLE HEARINGS. AT THESE HEARINGS VICTIMS OF RAPE OR FORCED TO SIT WITHIN FEET OF THEIR ATTACKERS AND RECAP FOR THE PAROLE BOARD THE HORRIBLE DETAILS OF THE RAPE THEY EXPERIENCED. AN OUT AS SINCE IMPACTED THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. AB THIRTY TWO THIRTY FOUR DID NOT COME THROUGH THIS-COMMITTEE. FOR CAREFUL THOUGHTFUL REVIEW BY YOUR COMMITTEE- BY YOU THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE NOR BY ANYONE FROM THE PUBLIC AT AN OPEN. AND TRANSPARENT HEARING. IN FACT AB THIRTY TWO THIRTY FOUR WAS NOT HEARD BY ANY SENATE COMMITTEE. IT WAS SIMPLY GOT IT AMENDED AND RUSHED TO THE FLOOR IN A MATTER OF DAYS. NO RAPE VICTIMS ARE ALLOWED TO TESTIFY AGAINST THE BILL THE VICTIMS RIGHTS ADVOCATES FOR ALLOWED TO TESTIFY AGAINST THE BILL. IT'S AS IF THE SENATE SIMPLY DISCOUNTED THAT THESE RAPE VICTIMS EVEN EXISTED AT ALL. TODAY THE SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE HAS A CHANCE TO RIGHT THE WRONG THAT WAS DONE TO RAPE VICTIMS A CHANCE TO RECOGNIZE THAT VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT SHOULD NOT BE FORCED. TO REPEATEDLY UNDER THE TRAUMA RELIVING THEIR ATTACK. WHEN ASKED WHY VIOLENT SEX OFFENDERS SHOULD BE GIVEN ELDERLY PAROLE BACK WHEN THE AGE WAS SIXTY THE EXCUSE OFTEN HEARD IS THAT SEX OFFENDERS CANNOT PHYSICALLY RE OFFEND. AT AN OLD AGE. ANOTHER DAY AGES BEEN REDUCED TO FIFTY. AND AS WE ALL KNOW FIFTY YEARS OF AGE IS HARDLY. ELDERLY THE EXCUSE THAT THESE VIOLENT SEX OFFENDERS ARE NOT PHYSICALLY CAPABLE OF RE RE OFFENDING NO LONGER WORKS AND WE HAVE SEEN COUNTLESS CASES OF VIOLENT SEX OFFENSES WHERE THE PERPETRATOR IS AGE FIFTY OR OLDER. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT MOST OF THE RAPISTS AND OTHER VIOLENT SEXUAL OFFENDERS ARE NOT NECESSARILY GETTING OUT WHEN THEY TURN FIFTY. HOWEVER IF YOU WILL. AND BY MAKING EVERY FIFTY YEAR OLD RAPIST ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY RELEASE YOU ARE FORCING NEEDLESS PAROLE HEARINGS. WE ARE FORCING NEEDLESS PAROLE HEARINGS TO OCCUR AND AGAIN FORCING EVEN MORE TRAUMA ON RAPE VICTIMS. YOU WILL HEAR TESTIMONY TODAY FROM TWO OUTSTANDING WITNESSES ONE IS A RAPE VICTIM AND SURVIVOR WHO HAS BEEN THROUGH THE TRAUMA OF A VIOLENT SEXUAL ATTACK. AND HER LIFE UP ENDED AFTERWARDS. AND NOW FACES THE THREAT OF HAVING TO RELIVE THE ATTACK AT COUNTLESS PAROLE HEARINGS. YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR. OTHER WITNESSES A FORMER DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHO HAS APPEARED AT SEVERAL PRO PAROLE HEARINGS ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE AND IN SUPPORT OF VICTIMS. I ASKED THE WOULD CAREFULLY LISTEN TO THEIR TESTIMONY TODAY. AND I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE OUR WITNESSES THE FIRST IS DON A VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND THE SECOND IS RICHARD SACHS THE FORMER DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU WE'LL SPLIT FIVE MINUTES BETWEEN YOU TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES SO- OVER THE FIRST WITNESS- PURCHASE OUR CORPORATE HEAD IS IT MR SACHS A FIRST WITNESS WILL BE DONE SIR OKAY OKAY DONT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM TESTIFYING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR FOUR FIVE. AS A SURVIVOR OF VIOLENCE AND- IN NINETEEN FIVE THE SERIAL RAPIST BROKE INTO MY HOME WHERE HE REPEAT RAPED AND SEX ASSAULT ME AT KNIFE POINT. AFTER THE SEVENTH VICTIM HE WAS APPREHENDED AND SUCH SENTENCED TO THREE AND TWENTY SIX YEARS TO LIFE PURSUANT TO THE ONE STRIKE SACRAMENTO. WE WERE ASSURED IT SAID IN THAT HE WOULD NEVER QUALIFY FOR PAROLE. WHEN THE YOUTH OFFENDER LAW AN ACT ONE STRIKE SECRETARY WORKS FROM ELEGY. OUR THE ONE STRIKE EXCLUSION NOT CURRENTLY BEING ENFORCED AND THIS OFFENDER WAS RECENTLY GIVEN HIS INITIAL PAROLE HEARING. UP UNTIL THE YOUTH OFFENDER AN ELDERLY PROLOGUES WERE ENACTED. I AM STILL BY THE CRIMINALS SYSTEM BECAUSE THE OFFENDER WAS IN PRISON FOR LIFE. NOW I HAVE BEEN STRIPPED OF THAT PROTECTION. THE MERE INCHES OF THE HEARING AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE COULD BE RELEASED BECAUSE HE OVERWHELMING DISTRESS AND ANGUISH AND I FELT. ALL OVER AGAIN. THANKFULLY THIS. NIGHT TIME BUT BATIC'S. BECAUSE STUFF. WELL THE ENTIRE CRAWL WITH X. HAVING TO FACE ATTACK AGAIN RELIVE THE TRAUMA OF YOUR FALL WAS UNBEARABLE. ALL IT DEPENDING WHERE THE- I CAN BY TO KEEP HIM BEHIND BARS NOT ONLY TO PROTECT MYSELF BUT TO PROTECT OTHER WOMEN FROM BECOMING VICTIMS AS WELL. ATTENDING PAROLE HEARINGS AND CLEARING THE POSSIBILITY OF HIS RELEASE IS A LIFE SENTENCE OF MY OWN. HOWEVER I FEEL AS THOUGH I DON'T HAVE ANOTHER ON. I HAVE TO DO AS IN MY POWER TO KEEP THEM IN PRISON. IF LEAST HE WILL BE A TO PUBLIC SAY. ALL WOULD PUT ME BACK THE COMPANY EVERY WOMAN HELP HIM. A DANGER. THE RISK OF REPEAT IF IS HIGH IN THESE OFFENDERS ARE DANGEROUS TO RELEASE A BY THE EARLY. EVEN AT THE AGE OF FIFTY UNDER THE ELDERLY PRO. UNLESS YOU. AND PER LAWS EXCLUDE LEVINE SEX OFFENDERS. I WILL BE FOR TO ENJOY THAT THE- PROTOCOL A AND- HELLO ME TO- HE FOR SEX OFFENDERS PUTS BACK ASKED GOAL OF AND TRAUMA. THERE CAN NO CLOSURE IF THERE IS A CO THREAT THAT THERE PERFECT COULD BE. THERE HAVE TO WORK RELIVE THEIR ASSAULT. SB FOUR FOR FIVE WOULD PROTECT VICTIMS HAVING TO AND THAT THE- TRAUMATIC SCHOOL HE COSTS. I AM YOU TO STOP BY SEX OFFENDER ROY FROM BEING VALUE OVER RIGHT AND VOTE IN FAVOR SB FORTY FIVE TO PREVENT FOR THOMAS. AND SUFFER. I'M HERE. CAN YOU HEAR ME. WE CAN HEAR YOU CORRECT OKAY. THANK YOU- TO THE HONORABLE SHARE IN THE HONORABLEMEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RICHARD SACHS I RECENTLY RETIRED IN MARCH FROM THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AFTER SERVING THIRTY SIX YEARS. I WAS THE INDIVIDUAL THAT FORMED AND- STRUCTURED THE A LIFE PER HEARING UNIT WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING THE POSITION OF THE STATE THAT BECOMES APT CALL HEARINGS INTO TERMINALLY SENTENCED INMATES- I HAVE APPEARED AT THOUSANDS OF PAROLE HEARINGS- I HAVE BEEN DOGGED BY THE BOARD. AS THE BOY OF. THE PERSON WHO TAKES A REASONED APPROACH ALWAYS AT THESE HEARINGS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY HEARINGS IN WHICH WE HAVE NOT OPPOSE PULL OF THE IN BASEBALL WE FELT THAT HAVE EARNED A PAROLE DATE. YEAH AND I YEAR MAKE SURE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF S. B. FOUR FORTY FIVE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT'S A COMMON SENSE MEASURE AND EVEN AGAINST ANY ODDS BASED ON TRENDS THAT I'VE HEARD AND BEEN AWARE OF FOR YEARS I ASK YOU TO PLEASE WITH AN OPEN MIND CONSIDER THIS MEASURE AND MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES MAKE GOOD SENSE FIRST IT ONLY APPLIES TO A VERY SMALL PERCENT OF THE INMATE POPULATION THE ONE STRIKE SEXUAL OFFENDERS PROXIMITY 3% THAT'D ONLY EXCLUDES THOSE WHO WERE SEVERELY TRAUMATISED THEIR VICTIMS THESE ARE ONE STRIKE SEX OFFENDERS BY INFLICTING VIOLENCE SEXUAL OFFENSES MAINLY AGAINST WOMEN AND IN SOME CASES TORTURE. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED THE SEX ONE STRIKE LAW THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY I RESEARCHED AND LOOKED AT IT SAID THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT HIGHER REPEAT OFFENDING AWAIT RECIDIVISM AND THEN THEY WANT TO TAKE THAT CHANCE SO THAT WAS THE IMPETUS BEHIND THE LAW. AND THEY HAVE TO COMMIT EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ACTS TO BE CONVICTED UNDER THIS SECTION SUCH AS CHILD MOLESTER UNDER FOURTEEN TYING AND BINDING THE VICTIM ATTACKING THEM IN THEIR HOME INCLUDING TORTURE GREAT BODILY INJURY USING WEAPONS AT CETERA ETCETERA THE WORST OF THE WORST AND SEX OFFENDERS I DO BELIEVE IN. SHE FOR IN BUT SOME CRIMES ARE JUST TOO HORRENDOUS IN NATURE AND TORTURE RAPISTS AND MURDERERS FALL INTO THAT CLASS AND CERTAINLY THEY CAN SEEK CLEMENCY COMMUTATION OF SENTENCE AND THERE IS OTHER AVENUES FOR THEM BUT TO TRAUMATIZE THESE FEMALE VICTIMS REALLY CONTRAVENES THE SPIRIT OF MARCZI LAW ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE GETTING A HEARING TO TWENTY YEARS AT AGE. FIFTY B. SPECTRUM SHOULD NOT UP TO FACE THE UP YOU'LL OF THE HERE ON A BY SEX OFFENDER. WHO JUSTIFIABLY RECEIVED A LONG TERM FOR THE PART OF SUCH. AND FUTURE BUT GIVE THE WELL. PREPARE OF THEM TO READ FAN. SOME PEOPLE THE NAME OF THEIR CLOUD. IT JUST COMMITTED YOUR WOULD BE MORE ACCESS THEIR WEAKENED FORTUNATELY THAT IS PART OF OUR CALIFORNIA MOSAIC WE HAVE TORTURE SEX MURDERERS AS PART OF OUR STATE JOSE A CAN THE STATE. AND THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT THIS LAWS TARGETED AT SO THEY ASK YOU IN CLOSING PLEASE CONSIDER THE FACT THAT THEY WERE EXCLUDED FOR USEFUL IT'S UP IN THE SUPREME COURT RIGHT NOW IN THE WILLIAMS CASE ON AN EQUAL PROTECTION ARGUMENT WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO COME OUT. AND THEY SHOULD BE EXCLUDED FOR ELDERLY ELDERLY ALREADY EXCLUDES THREE STRIKES AND FIRST DEGREE MURDER OF A PEACE OFFICER BUT IT DOESN'T EXCLUDE ANY SEX OFFENDERS THIS SMALL AMOUNT OF SEX OFFENDERS. THESE ONE STRIKERS AROUND THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED OR SO SHOULD BE EXCLUDED AND I ASK THAT YOU PLEASE MOVE THE BILL FORWARD TO CONSIDER THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY NOW WILL MOVE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE HEARING ROOM ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF S. P. FOUR FOUR FIVE.

I THINK THERE ARE TWO OF US AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THE OTHER AMERICA WILL SOON TO TIME TO GET TO ENOUGH MINUTES. NO PROBLEM GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR BRADFORD AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS KEITH WIDELY I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT ON COMMON LAW. I'M GONNA MAKE A THREE POINTS AND IN OPPOSITION- FIRST. THE FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL STRUCK DOWN THIS EXCLUSION. AND PEOPLE V. EDWARDS. AND THE SECOND DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL JUST DID THE SAME THING EARLIER THIS MONTH IN IN RE WOODS. IN CONTRAST BY GRANTING REVIEW AND PEOPLE'S V. WILLIAMS THE SUPREME COURT HAS ALREADY SIGNALED ITS DISAPPROVAL THAT LOWER COURTS OPINION UPHOLDING EXCLUSION. AGAIN THE ONLY TO PUBLISHED OPINIONS ON THIS ISSUE PROHIBITING SOLUTION THAT IS THE SOLE SUBJECT OF THIS BILL. FURTHERMORE THE PAROLE BOARD'S OWN WEBSITE SITES PEOPLE B. EDWARDS AS THE CONTROLLING AUTHORITY WHEN THE BOARD MAKES CLEAR AND I QUOTE AN INMATE MAY NOT BE DISQUALIFIED AS A YOUTH OFFENDER BASED ON THEIR CONTROLLING OF SENSE BEING SENTENCED UNDER PENAL CODE SECTION SIX SIX SEVEN POINT SIX ONE END QUOTE. SO THE PROBOARDS POSITIONED US COMPLETELY UNDERMINES THIS BILLS CLAIM THAT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT PRACTICE IN YOUTH PAROLE HEARINGS IT'S EITHER AN INTENTIONAL MISREPRESENTATION OR THE AUTHORS ARE SIMPLY UNINFORMED EITHER WAY THE BILL IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL IT COULD NEVER BE ENACTED- SECOND POINT IS THAT THIS BILL MAKES THE FALSE ASSUMPTION THAT- ELIGIBILITY EQUALS RELEASE. WE NEED ONLY LOOK AT. NOW COMES TO KNOW THE TRUTH. WITH AN 18% OF SCHEDULED ELDERLY PAROLE HEARINGS AND TWENTY TWENTY RESULTED IN PROGRAMS IN CASE YOU THINK THAT WAS A FUNCTION OF COVERT NINETEEN LAST YEAR- YOU SEE THAT THE PRIOR YEAR WAS SIMILAR. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US REALLY EXPECTS THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT STACKED PAROLE BOARD IS LIKELY TO GRANT PAROLE THESE CASES AT A HIGHER RATE. I DON'T SEE IT HAPPENING. MY LAST POINT. IS THAT THE REALLY THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL DON'T. CITE RECIDIVISM RATES OF PAROLE GRANT RATES. BECAUSE THEY KNOW NEITHER OF THOSE DATA POINTS SUPPORTS THE BILL. THIS BILL IS SIMPLY ABOUT TARGETING A GROUP OF PEOPLE THE AUTHORS DON'T LIKE OUR LAWS DO NOT PERMIT THAT. URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON AS BEFORE FOR FIVE BECAUSE IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL. AND BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT FEAR MONGERING NOT FACTS THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PRIMARY WITNESS ENDS OPPOSITION OF S. B. FOUR FOUR FOUR. ME FOUR FOUR FIVE I'M SORRY. MMHM GOOD AFTERNOON HIGH- MY NAME IS AMBER ROSE HOWARD HIGH SERVICE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CALIFORNIANS UNITED FOR RESPONSIBLE BUDGET WE ARE IS THAT WHAT COALITION OVER EIGHTY ORGANIZATIONS AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRETTY WORKING AROUND THESE SPECIFIC ISSUES- I REALLY REALLY DO- EACH YEAR YOUR NO VOTE ON FAR CRY FIVE IS BAD PUBLIC POLICY- THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE CURRENT ELDERLY PAROLE PROGRAM IS NOT WORKING IN FACT YOU HAVEN'T USED IT TO ECHO CAPACITY MANAGEMENT SOME OF THE STATISTICS THAT I'M INTO WHAT YOU JUST JEFF NAMES RIGHT BEFORE ME. ABBAS DOES NOT ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY ABOUT A PLATE SHOULD CONTINUE TO PRESERVE LENGTHY SENTENCES THAT- WOULD CONTINUE IF THEY- GET TOUGH ON CRIME ERA WHICH CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE BEEN SHIFTING AWAY FROM FOR THE LAST DECADE WE KNOW THAT UNDER THE CURRENT LAW- CODIFIED- YOU KNOW FOLKS ELIGIBLE FOR OTHER COLLECTED TWO YEARS OLD AND WE ALSO KNOW TO EXPECT THAT THE CONTRACT THAT PEOPLE OUR AGE THAT WE TEN YEARS OLDER- WHEN SERVING TIME IN THE PRESENT AND WE ALL HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH THE CONDITIONS ARE PRESENT THAT AS THEY EXIT. THE TIMING WHETHER TO GRANT PAROLE- WE KNOW THAT THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS HAVE TO CONSIDER AGE TIMES THERE- DIFFICULT CONDITION AND ALSO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF SOMEONE I'M CONVICTION BEFORE RELEASE THOUGH AGAIN THAT- THE CALL DID NOT NEED A EARLY RELEASE THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAVE TO BE NAMED THE CONSIDER CORN COMING GRANTED THAT RELATE- I THINK WE HAVE TO REALLY REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW- THE OTHER PROGRAM DID ARRIVE IF CALIFORNIANS DESPERATE NEED TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL COURT ORDERS- IN ORDER TO REDUCE OUR POPULATION- AND THERE ARE ALREADY EXISTING EXEMPTIONS AND THE OTHER GIRL- LAW WHICH INCLUDES PEOPLE CONVICTED UNDER THE THREE STRIKES LAW. INDIVIDUALS CAN CONFIRM AGUIAR-CURRY DEATH AND VOTE INDICATIVE OF FIRST DEGREE MURDER KILLING A POLICE OFFICER SO THEY'RE ALREADY EXEMPTION FOR THE OTHER GIRL MOM- THAT THE BOARD OF BROWN HEARING HAVE. TO CONSIDER WHEN BRINGING FOLKS FOR. WANT HAVE THE LOWEST RATE OF RECIDIVISM OF ALL FOLKS RELIEF FROM THAT COULD NOT GET THEM THEY ALSO HAVE THE LOWEST RATE EVER READ- EVEN IF THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN OUT OF PRISON SO I THINK THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS BILL WE HAVE TO WITH WHAT IT AIMS DO AND ACTUALLY IN TO ROLL ON THE PROGRESS THEY WE'VE ACTUALLY MADE AND CONSIDERING THE THAT CALIFORNIA CARTERET CALIFORNIA CORRECT RIGHT AND PERCENT OF THE UNITED STATES BRITAIN POPULATE AND I THAT THE OTHER PRO PROGRAM WITHIN TWO DIDN'T THOUSAND FOURTEEN- BECAUSE- WE NEEDED TO ADDRESS WHAT CALIFORNIA IS DOING- THE FACT THAT WE CONTINUE THANK THE SENTENCES- AND THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT EXACTLY ARE THE RIGHT MECHANISMS- PARTICULAR FOLKS ARE RELEASED.

ANYONE WISH TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF SB FOUR FOUR FIVE PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. WE HAVE NO ONE IN Q. THANK YOU MR MODERATOR NOW WILL BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THEIR QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS BY COMMITTEE SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR NINE OPPORTUNITY. TO TO SPEAK AND I- YOU- RIGHT NOT BEING HERE FOR HIS AWARENESS OF HIS IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE- HAVING TO ENGAGE ON A BILL- THERE BUT- THE AUTHOR DID X. DESCRIBE TO ME THE SITUATION WORK. AND YOU KNOW THE THESE- THESE CRIMES ARE THEIR HEINOUS AND HORRIFIC ANNA PERMANENTLY. HARMS PEOPLE AND CHANGES OUR LIFE- AND- YOU KNOW AND THAT IS TRUE OF A NUMBER OF CRIMES FOR WHICH BACK CAN YOU CAN SEEK ELDERLY PAROLE SOME VERY. SEVERE AND VIOLENT- CRIMES A HARM PEOPLE AND PERMANENTLY CHANGE THEIR LIVES. ON THE QUESTION HERE IS WHETHER. THESE PARTICULAR CRIMES SHOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM THOSE OTHER VERY SERIOUS CRIMES BY BEING CATEGORICALLY EXCLUDED FROM THE ELDERLY- PAROLE- PROGRAM- AND IT- I DON'T. I'D I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE MAKING. THAT DISTINCTION PUTTING ASIDE THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE BECAUSE WE KNOW WE ARE YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE EXCLUSION OF THESE PARTICULAR- CRIMES FROM THE YOUTH- PAPA PROGRAM- SO THAT IS OBVIOUSLY VERY SERIOUS ISSUE IN TERMS OF THIS. UNLIKELY BEING DEEMED UNCONSTITUTIONAL- BUT IT'S ON A ON A POLICY LEVEL- IN THE HOLD THE POINT OF THIS PROGRAM IS- IF YOU SERVED. AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS- AND IF YOU ARE- DEEMS- TO- TO NOT PRESENT- A RISK THEN YOU CAN BE CONSIDERED FOR- FOR ELDERLY. PAROLE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHEN THEY REACH A CERTAIN AGE ARE- MUCH LESS LIKELY TO COMMIT CRIMES AND- AND TO ENGAGE IN RECIDIVISM. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THESE PEOPLE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY PAROLED AND I KNOW IT IS. AND IT CAN BE TRAUMATIZING FOR A VICTIM TO PARTICIPATE IN A PAROLE HEARING I'M NOT IN ANY WAY- DISPUTING THAT OR OR OR DENYING THAT- BUT THAT'S THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE THE PEOPLE- ARE ENTITLED TO A SEAT RELEASE AND- AND I DO I JUST DON'T SEE. A REASON TO EXCLUDE THIS ONE CATEGORY OF CRIMES WHEN THERE ARE YOU KNOW THE YOU KNOW OTHER CRIMES THAT ARE THAT ARE ALSO INCREDIBLY HEINOUS BUT PEOPLE ARE ABLE IF THEY'RE SERVED AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS AND MEET THE CRITERIA CAN BE CONSIDERED BUT NOT AUTOMATICALLY GRANTED- ELDERLY. PAROLE AND SO I JUST DON'T- WHY UNDERSTANDS WHERE THIS BILL IS COMING FROM AND I. THINK IT'S COMING FROM THE HEART- AND- AND I TO I'M ANYWHERE. OF THE OFFER BRINGING THIS BILL. IT'S NOT A THAT I OF SIT. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS QUESTIONS BY MEMBERS ON THIS. ANJING NINE SYNERGY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CALL M. AND M'S CHAIR WITH AND OLD COULD I- THE OPPOSITION- I THINK LAID OUT SOME FAIRLY WELL THOUGHT OUT ARGUMENTS COULD I HAVE MR SACHS. JUST SPEAK REAL QUICK TO THE APPEALS I KNOW I THINK HE'S WERE ON A ON THAT AND THEN I THINK HE HAS SOME COMMENTS ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION AS WELL WOULD THAT BE OKAY. ARE VERY BRIEFLY THANK YOU OKAY MISTER SADDAM SERVICE RECALLS- AND- GOT ONE QUICK COMMENT AFTER THAT FOR MY CLOTHES YES SIR. I COULDN'T WRAP IT UP RATHER QUICKLY WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MISTER WHILE. HOUSE MINDED CROSSED OVER THE YEARS- WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO WHEN A YOUTHFUL OFFENDER EQUAL PROTECTION CASE I FEEL DOES NOT IN ANY WAY. MEAN THAT THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN ON AN ELDERLY PAROLE EQUAL PROTECTION CASE UP IN THE SUPREME COURT AND WHEN THE SUPREME COURT TAKES THE CAKE SHOP ON REVIEW. THEY DO NOT IT SAYS REYNOLDS ACCORD INDICATE ANY POSITION JUST FIVE MILLION TAKING THE CASE ALGONA RULES SO WE DON'T KNOW. AND YOU DON'T CROSS THE STATE STREET HEARING GUEST THIS POINT WOULD BE- NOT TO APPROPRIATE YEAH YOU KNOW I DO ALL THE BRIEFING FOR CDA OVER THE YEARS HAVE BEEN SORT OF THE LEGAL. ON PAROLE FOR YEARS AND YEARS FOR THE WHOLE STATE FOR THE PROSECUTORS. AND WE DON'T KNOW THE YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS PLENTY EQUAL PARTS ARGUMENT END UP IS NOT ME THE CASE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED THE RESULT CONSTITUTIONALITY ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S UNDER REVIEW. AND THAT PUTS THINGS YOU KNOW SORT OF IN LIMBO LAND GRANT WHILE TO WE GET A FINAL RULE. SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT I WOULD SAY ABOUT CONSTITUTIONALITY ARGUMENT THERE ISN'T ANY IMPEDIMENT TO STOP PASSING A BILL THAT IS NOT THE DE FACTO UNCONSTITUTIONAL ON ITS FACE MANY WAITED ALL. THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POLITICAL AND THOSE DIFFERENCES WOULD HAVE TO BE LITIGATED BEFORE ANYBODY CAN SAY IT'S AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL BILL SO I BELIEVE THAT'S FALSE. AND ALSO THE GRANT READ ON THESE CASES FOR HEARING CHILD ABOUT 33% YES YOU CAN GO DOWN 18% WOULD ACCOUNT STIPULATIONS TO INSTABILITY AND WAIVERS OF HEARINGS BUT THE ACTUAL HEARINGS HELD. TWENTY NINETEEN WAS 32% TWENTY TWENTY WAS 35% THAT'S THE NUMBER THAT GETS GRANTED. ON PEACE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- JONES JOINED CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER SHE IN LOOK THEIR THERE'S A LOT OF- PASSION ARGUMENTS ON BOTH OF THIS IS AND I YEARS THAT I THINK KNOW THE BY LINE HERE FOR THIS COMMITTEE CONSIDER IS A COUPLE THINGS NUMBER ONE. THIS WAS LOWERED FROM SIXTY TO FIFTY AND-I WOULD HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE FIFTY IS NOT ELDERLY- I WOULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT SIXTIES NOT ELDERLY- BUT IT DIDN'T EVEN COME TO YOUR COMMITTEE AND IT HAS- SENATORS THAT- DULY SIT ON THIS COMMITTEE. AND CONSIDER THESE ISSUES ALL YEAR- I WOULD TAKE IT AS AN OFFENSE. THAT'S SOMETHING WITH WHICH IT WAS PUT THROUGH LIKE THIS WITHOUT COMING THROUGH FOR PROPER REVIEW- BY THIS COMMITTEE IF THIS COMMITTEE FINDS THAT- MAYBE MY BILL IS A STEP TOO FAR HI GREAT I UNDERSTAND THAT. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS THE RIGHT NUMBER. TO PUT ON THIS OR WHAT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO PROCEED ON THIS. I THINK FOR VICTIMS. THAT HAVE BEEN AS A CENTER WIENER POINTED OUT THEIR LIVES HAVE BEEN CHANGED. BY THE SITUATION THAT THEY DIDN'T ASK TO BE PUT IN. BY THESE SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS. AND IN A LET'S. BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS THIS IS NOT SEXUAL HARASSMENT THIS IS NOT A- A TEENAGER MAKING AN INDISCRIMINATE MISTAKE THIS IS A PERSON WHO PURSUED ANOTHER HUMAN BEING. FOR THE PURPOSE OF CAUSING HARM IN A SEXUAL MANNER. AND I THINK THAT THIS TYPE OF CRIME RISES TO THE LEVEL WHERE IT NEEDS THIS TYPE OF DISCRETION AND I WOULD ASK THE COMMITTEE TO APPROVE THIS BILL AND IF WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO ON IT GREAT LET'S HAVE THAT CONVERSATION- AND- LET'S PROTECT THE VICTIMS. IN THESE. OR WILL CRIMES I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU ARE WERE SEEKING IN MOTION ON S. THREE FOUR FOUR FIVE IS TO PASS A REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS IS OUR MOTION.

GEORGE OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK- WITH MY TEAM OUR SPONSORS THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION SB THREE SEVENTEEN ADDRESSES TWO ISSUES FIRST EXISTING PROVIDES AND COMPETENT DEFENDANTS CAN ONLY RECEIVED TIME SERVED CREDITS FOR GOOD CONDUCT WHEN IN A COUNTY JAIL HOWEVER DOES NOT A BY THE TIME SPENT ONE A TREATMENT FACILITY. SECONDLY IS JUST EXISTING LAWS NOT PROVIDING COMPTON DEFENDANTS ADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT WHEN THE DEFENDANT IS CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR. DEFENDANTS OFTEN. AT ALL THEIR PRE TRIAL DETENTION WAITING IN JAIL FOR TREATMENT THAT. USER CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM OXY FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT PROGRAMS IS WRONG. IT'S BEEN A DEFAULT OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR TOO LONG. THIS BILL WILL HOPEFULLY REMEDY ONE UNFORTUNATE IN JUSTICE FOR- FROM OUR CURRENT SYSTEM BY ENSURING THAT DEFENDANT DEFENDANTS WERE FOUND TO BE INCOMPETENT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE SAME TIME SERVE CREDIT FOR GOOD CONDUCT IS THEIR COPTIC COUNTERPARTS. WHILE RECEIVING TREATMENT ANY TREATMENT FACILITY OR AN OUT PATIENT. NOT JUST AS COUNTY JAIL TREATMENT. CAN GET INTO MORE DETAILS. BUT JUST TO BE CLEAR NOT ALL OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR EVERY DESCENDANTS THEIR DEPENDING ON THE- SITUATION IN THE MENTAL HEALTH STATUS EACH DEPENDENT. DEFENDED A TAILORED APPROACH REALLY WELL I WAS TO USE EXISTING TOOLS TO GAIN COMPETENCY IN A FORTY CYCLE OF INCARCERATION. AND BETTER TURN TO MY LEAD WITNESSES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THREE WE SEE YOU TO LEAD WITH WERE BY. AND STUFF REGUL- GARCIA ARE YOU PREPARED. RICARDO GARCIA I AM PREPARED CAN YOU HEAR ME YEAH WE CAN HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR- YOU THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU- COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR TAKING THE TIME AND I WANT TO THANK CENTER STERN TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO ALL OF YOU HERE TODAY JOHN RICARDO GARCIA OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER. AND I'M NOT ONLY SPEAKING TO YOU AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE LARGEST AND OLDEST PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICE IN THE NATION BUT ALSO AS A TWENTY FIVE YEAR TRIAL LAWYER WHO SPENT THE MAJORITY OF HIS CAREER REPRESENTING THE VERY PEOPLE THIS BILL WILL BRING FAIRNESS. AND EQUITY FOR. SENATE BILL THREE SEVENTEEN SETS OUT TO ENSURE. THAT PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS WHO ARE INCARCERATED PRE TRIAL. IN THE STATE HOSPITAL OR OTHER MANDATORY DETENTION. RECEIVE THE SAME CREDITS AS PEOPLE INCARCERATED ELSEWHERE. THE CURRENT LAW AWARDS CONDUCT CREDITS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLUNTARILY INCARCERATED PRE TRIAL THESE ARE PRESUMED INNOCENT INDIVIDUALS. THESE CREDITS ARE OFTEN THE ONLY BENEFIT TO THE PRE TRIAL INCARCERATION. PRESUMED INNOCENT PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS COURT DETAINED PRE TRIAL BECAUSE OF THEIR SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS ARE NOT AWARDED THE SAME CREDITS. SIMPLY PUT A LOT TODAY PUNISHES CALIFORNIANS SUFFERING FROM A MENTAL ILLNESS MORE SEVERELY THAN THOSE WHO ARE NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEY'RE MENTALLY ILL. THIS IS UNJUST AND INHUMANE. WE MUST TREAT AND HELP PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS WE CAN'T KEEP THEM IN A CAGE. THIRTY AFTER STUDY SHOWS IT JAILING THE MENTALLY ILL CAUSES THEM TO BE COMPENSATE AND FACE MORE SEVERE COMPLICATIONS IN THEIR CASE AND LIVES INCLUDING INCREASED LIKELIHOOD OF RE OFFENSE. THAT IS THE OPTION THEY WOULD FACE IF THEY WANTED TO RECEIVE THE SAME CUSTODY CREDITS AFFORDED THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE A MENTAL ILLNESS. THE CURRENT LAW IS ALSO FISCALLY IMPRUDENT. TAXPAYERS MUST PAY THE EXTRA AND CAR SERRATION COST. FOR A MENTALLY ILL PERSON SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT GET THE SAME CONDUCT CREDITS AS OTHERS. MEANING BACK BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET THE CONDO CREDITS THEY END UP SPENDING MORE TIME IN CUSTODY. WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY CHARGED TO THE TAXPAYERS AND A BURDEN ON THE INDIVIDUAL. OUR MEN OF STATE HOSPITAL SAYS THIS INEQUITY AFFECTS ROUGHLY TWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS EVERY YEAR. SENATE BILL THREE SEVENTEEN WILL CLARIFY THE CONDUCT CRITICS STATUTE AND ENSURE THAT PEOPLE BECAUSE OF MENTAL ILLNESS THAT SPEND THEIR PRE TRIAL TIME INCARCERATED IN THE STATE HOSPITAL OR OTHER MANDATORY RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITY RECEIVE THE SAME CREDITS AS EVERYONE ELSE. WE SHOULD TREAT WE SHOULD BE TREATING PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS WITH THE SAME CARE AND COMPASSION WE TREAT ANYONE WITH A MEDICAL CONDITION. I URGE YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU NOW WILL MOVE TO STEPHANIE REGULAR. GOOD AFTERNOON CARE VICE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS HI MY NAME IS STEPHANIE REGULAR I'M A BOARD MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDER ASSOCIATION THE TELEPHONE CARE ACT BE THREE SEVENTEEN. I'VE ALSO BEEN A PUBLIC DFENDER FOR TWENTY YEARS AND IN THE COUNTRY COSTA COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER MENTAL HEALTH UNIT FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS. DESPITE INNOVATIVE REFORM EFFORTS BY THIS LEGISLATURE THE DIVERT INDIVIDUALS SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS FROM CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. YOU WERE CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANOR AND FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. REMAIN IN OUR JAILS AND STATE HOSPITAL THAT. I SEE THE SAME PEOPLE YEAR AFTER YEAR AND I SEE THE CALL THAT HOMELESSNESS REPEAT INCARCERATION AND INADEQUATE ACCESS TO TREATMENT HAS ON THEIR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. UNDER EXISTING LAW THE COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR INDIVIDUALS CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANORS FOR BANNING COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. AND THE COUNTIES MUST DEDICATE THEIR OWN RESOURCES TO COMPETENCY RESTORATION. IS RESTORATION SERVICES RANGE FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY WITH A FOCUS ON SHORT TERM STABILITY RATHER THAN LONG TERM SOLUTION. SOME CUNTIES USED THEIR COSTLY INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC BEDS FOR RESTORATION. OTHER COUNTIES COMMITTEES INDIVIDUALS CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANOR. BERMAN STATE HOSPITALS DESPITE THE OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED PERSON WAITLIST AND DAILY COST OF SIX HUNDRED TWENTY SIX DOLLARS FOR THE BAD. AND MANY COUNTY HOW THESE INDIVIDUALS AND THE JAIL UNTIL YOU REACH THE END OF THEIR COMMITMENT. WEATHER STABILIZE AND COUNTY IMPATIENT BAD RESTORED AND A HOSPITAL ARE MAXED OUT IN THE COUNTY JAIL. IN THE END THESE PEOPLE ARE ALL TYPICALLY RELEASED TO THE STREET WITH NO CONTINUITY OF CARE. THIRTEEN SEVENTY POINT OH ONE AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN IS NOT IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS. BUT THAT HEALTHCARE. DISPEL OFFICE COURTS THE FLEXIBILITY TO EXISTING DIVERSION PROGRAMS COLLABORATE COURT AND OTHER COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT OPTIONS TO TREAT RATHER THAN INCARCERATED WITH MISDEMEANOR FOR INTERFERING OF MENTAL ILLNESS.

FOUR VOTES HOLDER MEASURES ARE FOR ZERO WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS NOW SENATOR ARE YOU PREPARED FOR S. B. THREE SEVEN SIX AM. WHEN YOU'RE READY OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- FIRST ONE I THINK COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING CLOSELY WITH US ON THIS ONE AS WELL- THIS MEASURE IS A MUCH MORE PARED DOWN VERSION OF BILL WE HAD LAST SESSION AND THIS YEAR WERE SPECIFICALLY JUST FOCUSED ON MITIGATING THE RISK OF DO NOT A DISEASE TRANSMISSION IN CALIFORNIA- WE KNOW THAT IT'S NOT JUST COVERED NINETEEN IT'S COME FROM SYNODIC. ORIGINS BUT ALL THE LAST MAJOR ENDEMICS EPIDEMICS FROM SARS DEMURS- ABLE- AND ALL YOU KNOW PREVIOUS VIRUSES THAT HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS I HAVE DO NOT ECOREGIONS AND SO WE FEEL LIKE WE DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE- WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING ENFORCEMENT ABILITY RIGHT NOW- WHEN IT COMES TO- INSURING THAT THE AT THE BLACK MARKET IN THE TRADE- WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT RESOURCE INTERNATIONALLY- ITS THIRD ONLY TO- HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN THE DRUG TRAFFICKING INDUSTRY IS THE TRANSPORTATION AND TRAFFICKING OF WILDLIFE AND. ANIMALS- AND SO. WE HAVE A VERY LIMITED AND OF FOLKS IN DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE- DO THIS TRACKING RIGHT NOW AND WHO DO THE WORK SO WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE THEM SOME CLARITY IN STANDARDS HERE. TO MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE TRANSPORTING WILD ANIMALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE SELLING THEM- GET YOU. HAVE NO RISK OF HIS UNITED DISEASE TRANSMISSION TO A PERSON- SO IT ONLY APPLIES A VERY UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES IF AND ONLY IF THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT MAKES A FINDING THAT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE EXISTS. AND THEY SUGGEST THAT. GENETIC RISK COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A NOVEL NOT PREVIOUSLY REPORTED READILY TRANSMISSIBLE DISEASE SO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I'VE BEEN TALKING WITH THE OPPOSITION- I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT- A POSSESSION STANDARD WITHIN THE BILL- I AM I ALSO WITH THE INTENT SECTION OF THE BILL. SO I'M I'M AMENABLE TO AGREEING THAT THE CHANGES- TO AMEND THE BOTH THE INTENSE ACTION A BILL AS WELL AS TODAY- TO AMEND- THE PACIFIC POSSESSION ELEMENT FROM SECTION THREE OF THE BILL. AS WELL AS TO REMOVE THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AT THE SUGGESTION OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF. AND WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR- THANK YOU NOW WILL MOVE TO YOUR TO PER. WITH AND SUPPORT WE HAVE CUMMINGS. AND WE HAVE JUDY MACALUSO. SO WE'LL START WITH MISTER CUMMINGS. GOOD AFTERNOON RENDON CUMMINGS WITH THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. THE INTERNATIONAL WILDLIFE TRADE IN ADDITION TO BEING ONE OF THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE EXTINCTION CRISIS. WITH A LIKELY ORIGIN OF THE CUPBOARD NINETEEN PANDEMIC THAT CONFIRMED BUT THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION EARLIER THIS MONTH COBIT NINETEEN LIKELY ORIGINATED NOT THAT. MADE THE JUMP TO ANOTHER SPECIES AND FROM THERE TO HUMAN. TRANSMISSION TRAIN MOST LIKELY OCCURRED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE TRADING EITHER WILD CARDS PERFORMED WILDLIFE. AND THE FIRST LARGE OUTBREAK OF THE DISEASE BECAUSE A LIVE ANIMAL MARKETS. GLOBALLY ABOUT 60% OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES ARE CONSIDERED NOT MEANING THEY JUMP FROM ANIMALS TO PEOPLE I JUST BELIEVE THAT THE MAJORITY OF ALL FUTURE EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASE WILL COME FROM WILDLIFE. THE CODE NINETEEN OUTBREAK HAS LED HAS LED NUMEROUS INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING ELEMENTS OF THE U. AND NWHL CONTRABAND BY RESTRICTIONS ON. THE LIKE WILDLIFE TRADE. RECENTLY THE AMERICAN CLIMATE SIGN INTO LAW PRESIDENT BIDEN LET MONTH. RIGHT THE RESPECT TREE BETTER THAN CARNAGE. ALLOCATING TO QUOTE DRESS WHAT LIKE IS EITHER. BEFORE THEY PANDEMICS.

OKAY THEN AZ ACCREDITED ZOOS FROM CERTAIN PERMIT REQUIREMENTS THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THAT NEWS LIKE THE ONE YOU WILL HEAR FROM. CHIU NOT NEED TO HIRE A VA SANDERS AT THE LAST ON. IN LOWER CALIFORNIA STANDARDS WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS APPROPRIATE BUT IN ANY CASE THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. THIS BILL DOES NOT CREATE A BLANKET PROHIBITION ON IMPORTATION OF RESTRICTED SPECIES ARE EVEN SPECIES THAT POSE A DISEASE RISK WHERE THERE ARE PROTOCOLS FOR ROBOT HANSTEEN AFFECTED TREATMENT OR QUARANTINE THE DEPARTMENT NAY ALLOW HER MANAGE EVEN TURNED NINE AZ EIGHT. THIS BILL IS A PRUDENT AND MEASURED RESPONSE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS FROM DO NOT A DISEASES AND OUR NATIVE WILDLIFE FROM INVASIVE SPECIES WE HOPE THAT THIS PAST YEAR HAS DEMONSTRATED THE VALUE AND AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION WHEN PROTECTING OURSELVES FROM DO NOT EXPEL OVER.

THAT WORKERS ACROSS THE FILM AND TELEVISION INDUSTRY INCLUDING HOLLYWOOD ANIMAL TRAINERS AND HANDLERS WE SHOULD AUTHORS GOAL OF REACHING THE UNITED TRANSMISSION OR DVDS WE BELIEVE AS DRAFTED THE BILL EXCEEDS THAT OBJECTIVE. SB THREE SEVEN SIX WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT EXTENSION WILDLIFE I WISH WITH ALL THE ANIMALS THAT YOU NOT BE TO GAS TRANSPORTED WITHIN ONE IMPORTED INTO THE STATE RIGHT NOW THE DEPARTMENT IS ALREADY GRAPPLING WITH CREDIBILITY TO WEST WILD ANIMAL PRODUCTION SHOULD NOT BE IMPORTED OR TRANSPORTED TO THE STATE. AND ALREADY DOING SO. BUT ADDING TO GET TANKS. WITHIN THE CITY WILL WORK SB THREE SEVEN KICK SOME IT POSSIBLE FOR MEMBERS. TO DO THEIR JOB AND CAL. BECAUSE THE MOTION PICTURE. SCRIPT CALLS FOR DETECTION OF AN ANIMAL THAT ADDED TO GO WHERE. THAT PRODUCTION WILL NECESSARILY HAPPEN DOWN AT LEAST PART OF THE PROJECT AD OTHER STATE. QUESTION FOR A COUPLE OF AMENDMENTS INCLUDING THE DELETION OF PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO SECTION THREE THE BILL. PREFERENCE BY SENATOR STERN REGARDING POSSESSION AND TRANSPORTATION- WITHIN THE STATE LIKEWISE ARE ASKING IF THE DIRECTOR DECIDES TO SUSPEND EXISTING AUTHORIZATION OR DO YOU AUTHORIZATION. FOR IMPORTATION OF A WILD ANIMAL THAT THEY DO SO BASED ON PEER REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. THAT DETERMINATION IS ROOTED IN SCIENCE TOGETHER WE BELIEVE THESE AMENDMENTS WE GET THE BILL AND A WORKABLE PLACE FOR MEMBERS AND STILL GIVE THE DEPARTMENT GREATER LEEWAY. TO DRESSES DO NOT A TRANSMISSION OF DISEASES- SHOULD THE NEED ARISE WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH CENTER STERN AND HOPE TO GET THAT. I GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN PROTECT OUR MEMBERS JOBS WOULD STILL NEED. THE BALL FORWARD ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CHARLIE SALMON. SERVICE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF MONTEREY YOU AND WHO ARE SO OF A- WE'RE SORRY YOUR THAT OUR LETTERS OPPOSITION AND THOSE OF SEVERAL OTHERS THAT MADE IT INTO THE PORTAL WERE NOT PRESENT REPRESENTED IN THE ANALYSIS THE CO SPONSOR. BUDGET SPOKE COMPLETELY. CALLS DESCRIPTION OF BOTH ARE YOU AND HE'S READING STANDARDS IT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE INACCURATE HOWEVER IN THE MANY MEETINGS WITH SENATOR STERN AND HIS STAFF WE CONTINUE TO BE TOLD THAT THEY UNDERSTAND OUR CONCERNS AND DON'T DISAGREE WITH THEM YET THE BILL CONTINUES TO MOVE FROM COMMITTEE TO COMMITTEE WITHOUT ONE AMENDMENT. ADDRESSING THOSE CONCERNS. BIASED AGENDA OF SB THREE SEVEN SIX IS AN OBVIOUS ATTACK AIMED AT SMALLER RESUMES IN LESS AFFLUENT COMMUNITIES. THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE THE POLITICAL LOBBY TO ASSURE ITS FAILURE. BUT YOU DOING SO ACTUALLY POSES POSES A HEALTH RISK CALIFORNIANS IN AREAS WITH NEWS EXEMPTS FROM THE VERY PROTECTION IT CLAIMS TO OFFER. THE FACT NEEDS TO BE MADE PUBLIC IN CLEAR WE'RE ASKING ALL OF YOU TO PLEASE DEMAND ANSWERS TO CERTAIN QUESTIONS. CALIFORNIA FISH AND WILDLIFE ALREADY HAS A LIST OF ANIMALS AS TEAMSTERS JUST TESTIFIED. ALL ZOOS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BEFORE WE IMPORT THOSE ANIMALS SO WHY DO WE NEED A NEW LAW FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO SIMPLY ADD ANIMALS TO THAT EXISTING LISTS. NEXT WE QUESTION IT SENATORS DURING ITS OPENING THIS LAW TO AMEND IT BECAUSE OF THE NEW AND UNPRECEDENTED HEALTH INSECURITY THE CALIFORNIA'S. WHY IS HE NOT AMENDING THE PART OF THE SAME LAW. WHERE THERE IS A CURRENT SCIENTIFIC PROOF THAT THE THREAT ACTUALLY EXISTS. AGAIN WE'RE LED TO BELIEVE THAT THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE OF THREE SEVEN SIX IT IS IT'S ACTUALLY GENDA THE CLOSURE OF SMALL DO THE LESS APPEALING COMMUNITIES. SENATOR STERN FEELS THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO ENTER A DEBATE BETWEEN TWO LITTLE LOGICAL ORGANIZATIONS BUT IN FACT THOSE TWO ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOT AT EACH OTHER. IT'S A DEBATE BETWEEN THE BILL'S SPONSOR AND THE SMALLER TRADE ORGANIZATION WHICH THEY FEEL DOESN'T HAVE THE LOBBY TO BATTLE THEIR AGENDA. AS THE ANZ EIGHT EIGHT RESPECT EACH OTHER AND WORK TOGETHER ON MANY YOU A LOGICAL AND CONSERVATION ARENA. FINALLY WE STILL FEEL THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT AN ADDED PARAGRAPH IN THIS BILL. IT SEEMS TO COVER. AN IMMENSE AND AN EXEMPTION FOR THE COLLEGE IN THE SENATOR'S OWN DISTRICT. REGARDLESS OF HIS INTENT THE PARAGRAPH DOES OFFER SOMEWHAT OF AN EXEMPTION FOR THAT COLLEGE. AND WE HAVE STAFF FROM THAT COLLEGE TELLING US THAT THEY'VE BEEN GUARANTEED THAT EXEMPTION. JOSIE IN MONTEREY SUPPORT ALL THROUGH EFFORTS TO SHUT DOWN WET MARKETS HOWEVER S. THREE PIECE THREE SEVEN SIX WILL NOT SHUT DOWN WE'LL SHUT DOWN OUR COMMUNITY IS BRAND NEW.

INTERCOM WATER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SO I WANT TO THANK THE- AUTHOR FOR- WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT- THERE WERE A ROBUST- NUMBER OF CALLS FOLKS CALLING IN ABOUT THIS BILL YOU KNOW FOR THE RECORD I GOT A LOT OF FOLKS CALLING ME ASKING ME TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I DO WANT TO SAY FOR THE RECORD THAT I AM THE BLACK LADY WHO CARES ABOUT ANIMALS- SINCE THAT WAS A QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED AND- WHY AT WHILE I APPRECIATED ONE CALLING AND I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT YOU ALL- COLIN WHEN WE'RE- DEALING WITH BILLS ABOUT PEOPLE. TO BECAUSE THAT IS IMPORTANT. SO I'M- MISTER THIS STERN AYE X. HAVE A FOR YOU I'M MIGHT BE CONFUSED I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THIS WAS A BILL ABOUT LIVE MARKETS- AND I WAS WANTING IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE TEAMSTERS AND BY THOSE FOLKS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY BECAUSE I WAS SURPRISED TO GET THE NUMBER OF CALLS THAT I GOT FROM THEM ADDRESSING ASPECTS OF THIS BILL THAT THEY WERE IN CONFLICT WITH AND THAT WASN'T WHAT MY ASSUMPTION WAS ABOUT THE BILL FOR ITS INTENDS- AND SO NOW I'M- SLIGHTLY CONFUSED AND I THINK IT WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL IF YOU COULD GO OVER- THE SPECIFIC AMENDMENTS THAT YOU DID EXCEPT BECAUSE I KNOW THEY HAD ALSO TALKED ABOUT AMENDMENTS. AND IT SEEMS LIKE THOSE HAVE NOT MADE IT INTO THE BILL AND SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL JUST TO CLARIFY THAT AT LEAST FOR ME BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THIS WAS ABOUT ONCE AGAIN LIVE MARKETS AND WHAT SOLD THERE AND THE FACT THAT THIS SEEMS TO STILL BE BLEEDING OUT INTO OTHER INDUSTRIES- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL. FOR ME TO GET THAT CLARITY. STRUCTURE BURGER OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR YEAH I TOO WAS SURPRISED BY AMOUNT OF CALL THAT WE WENT THROUGH ALTHOUGH IT'S LIKE YOU FROM- ONE PARTICULAR BUSINESS- BUT THAT'S I AM SO TO ANYONE IN HOLLYWOOD FILM PRODUCTION- YOU KNOW WORRIED ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCE OF A LEGISLATION WE DO BECAUSE- THAT'S THE BUSINESS THAT PUT ME THROUGH SCHOOL AND- AND I OWE EVERYTHING TO THEM SO- TO BE CLEAR ABOUT. WHAT THE THURMOND THAT WE TAKEN- SOME OF THE FOLKS WERE. THAT THIS WILL SOMEHOW- PENALIZED FOR POSSESS A PENITENTIAL SICK. SO THAT WAS ONE REQUEST FROM I GUESS TEAMSTERS MAYBE SOME OF THE ANIMAL TRAINER FOLKS THAT ARE PHILLY WOULD. TO WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE THAT AMENDMENT THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN. THAT WAS BROUGHT UP I FOR US TO THAT FINDING OF THIS RISK OF THE DISEASE- ON PEER REVIEWED EVIDENCE. AND THE REASON WE WEREN'T COMFORTABLE WITH PEER REVIEWED EVIDENCE VERSES THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE THAT IS THE STANDARD IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW IS THAT IN A CASE LIKE COUPLE VERY- IT TOOK MONTHS AND MONTHS TO GET ANY PEER REVIEWED STUDIES DONE. SO WHILE YOU'RE IN THE MIDST OF A CRISIS IMAGINE IF YOU'RE IMPORTING DIFFERENT ANIMALS INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SELLING AND TRANSPORTING THEM OR OTHERWISE. AND THERE'S A MAJOR NOT A DISEASE OUTBREAK I DO I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY WE WOULD WANT TO WAIT SEVERAL MONTHS FOR A PEER REVIEWED STUDY TO LOOK AT THE- DISEASE. OUTBREAK IF. THE DIRECTORS AFTER MADE A WRITTEN BAY ON SITE EVIDENCE THAT WAS THAT RICK'S. SO THE IS NOT SUPPOSED JUST SINGLE OUT SAY LIVE AND MARKETS WE DIDN'T WANT TO- YOU KNOW JUST CALL ONE IS. SET IT WAS MORE ABOUT. TRANSPORTING IMPORTING SICK ANIMALS IN THE CALIFORNIA. I HATE THE IS NOT TO BORROWER ALI FROM BEING ON THE A BEAR OR A LOT. IN A FEW- I KNOW THERE'S A LONG HISTORY MAY BE OF MISTRUST BETWEEN SOME OF THE ADVOCATES WHO ARE SUPPORTING THE BILL. MAYBE SOME OF THE FOLKS IN HOLLYWOOD WHO LIKE TO TRAIN ANIMALS OR WANT TO SEE MORE ANIMALS IN OUR FILM PRODUCTION BUT- IT. WE'RE NOT CALLING OUT THE THOSE PRODUCTION STUDIOS OR THESE SMALL ZOOS OR THE LIVE ANIMAL MARKETS ARE ANY OF THEM IN PARTICULAR IT'S REALLY JUST SAYING. IF THE CITY OF W. DIRECTOR SEES THERE'S A SERIOUS RISK OF A DISEASE THEN YOU'VE GOT A LIST THAT ANIMAL ON THIS RESTRICTED SPECIES LIST- SO. THAT'S THE THAT WOULD BE MY- I'M VERY OPEN LIKE IF WE WANNA DRILLED AND- WHAT THAT SIGNED EVIDENCE SHOULD BE DEBT IT WOULDN'T WE WANTED WOULD WANT TO BE SAY AN ARBITRARY DECISION FROM CDFW. OR SOMEHOW THEY BECAME CAPTIVE OF ONE PARTICULAR GROUP AND DECIDED THEY SUDDENLY WANTED TO SHUT DOWN ANYONE WHO WANTED TO PUT A LINE IN INTO A FILM- YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT. THAT'S NOT WHAT THESE BILLS TRYING DO. I THINK IT THE LANGUAGE IS CLEAR WE'RE TO ME. THAT MORE CLEAR- BUT I JUST DON'T. I DON'T CONFUSED TO. I DON'T KNOW. MY DEAREST FOR AND HOW WOULD WANT THE- TO. OR SELL. TENSION LEE VERY SO AND IN CAL- AND HAVE THE- FOR CD. TO HAVE SO SPACE ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE JUST WANT THROUGH WITH COVERT SO I'M HOPING WE WORK THIS OUT- AS FOR THE HI WE CAN. ANY OTHER TESTIMONY LATER BUT I'M REALLY DO. FRANKLY WITH THE- SOME OF THE TESTIMONY I HEARD FROM FOR MINER REYES YOU I THOUGHT WE GOT OFF ON A DIFFERENT FOOD AND WE'RE GOING TO TURN OPERATING GOOD. IN NO ONE WAS TO A LEGEND FALSE BUT- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS HEARD THERE I DON'T KNOW. I YEAH I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT BUT I JUST DISAPPOINTING. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ARE. CENTER UNTIL VOCAL. LIKE TO GO FIRST YEAR OKAY- THANK YOU STERN FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE FOR AND- I UNDERSTAND THE ENTIRE OF BILL I DO HAVE A QUESTION WITH REGARDS TO. AB THE REASON FOR THE EXTENSION IN THE BILL WHICH ONLY APPLIES TO THE ASSOCIATION OF ZOOS AND AQUARIUMS THE AZ EIGHT BUT NOT THOSE DO A LOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA DISEASE Z. EIGHT A- WOULD YOU CONSIDER EXPANDING THAT EXCEPTION TO BOTH. AS CHAIR ROTORK OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER TROUBLED AT THE SIX I THINK YOU WERE FOR TO IN TWO ONE- TO ONE FIFTY. B. E. TO. THANKS TEN OF THE BILL THANK ITS MENTION IN YOUR TO THE AMENDMENT- DOESN'T EXEMPTS- ANY PARTICULARS DO AND CERTAINLY NOT AS THE OPPONENT. SORRY THIS IS THE WE HAVE THAT LINE OKAY YOU- SO IF YOU THERE ARE JUST READ BRIEFLY LANGUAGE. IT'S THAT THERE MAY BE AN EGG OR BAD SHORT MAYES STICK RISK SPEECH PERMIT FOR A LIVE WHILE THEY'RE- THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE PRO. RIGHT SO THAT WE IT OTHERWISE MY MIGHT BE BETTER OTHERS NOT IT DOES RISK. ONLY ON A CASE BY CASE IS THE CASE BASS. ONLY TO A UNIVERSE COLLEGE GOVERNMENT RE A OR BODY. I AND- CONDUCTING BONNEFOY MET OR- RE THAT NOT OTHERWISE BE. WITH THE FACT THAT LIE WHILE THEY'RE- SO THIS IS NOT AN EXAM FORCE- TEACHING DO IN MY IS. IT WOULDN'T APPLY INSTANCE KNOW THE OUT MORE POOR DO I REALLY REALLY JUST. TO HEAR THAT OF NAME CALLING A SERIOUS AND- HEARING THIS IS ABOUT A- RESEARCHING. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT TOO WAS VERY AND SOME OF THE FILES ALLOW. THAT DO VERY. HIGH RISK BUT SIRIUS IN NASA RE. WITH SAY STATE BATS WITH COVERT- YOU HAVE TO CAN. MEDICAL OR SO. RE AND A VERY HIGH BAR YES IF GET A SAID PER ON THAT SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS A BROAD EXAM SAVE. ALL ZOOS CERTAIN KINDS IT'S REALLY NOT ABOUT ZOOS ABOUT- THESE. RESEARCH SINCE ARE THE THERE'S ABOUT SEVEN THEM UP CALIFORNIA NOW. AND HOW THE M. SO. THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND- RT RATE IN. OF ANIMAL AND ANNA PRODUCTS TO PREVENT SPREAD OF ZERO. SUED NAS. AND IPOD FOR THE- IF I DON'T A CAREER. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IN A TO WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE WHY NEED FOR THAT. WE DIDN'T FEEL THE CDC DID. WORK HI- ON DURING A CO CRISIS- ON THE FRONT END AND WE THINK THAT WE'VE GOT MAJOR AND KERR. GIVEN WHAT THE LOWER IMPORT EXPORT- A STATE WE ARE IN THE LEVEL OF TWO COMING IN AND OUT OF THIS BOTH FOR OTHER STATES INTERNET. FROM THAT ARE PORTS INSTANCE ASSEMBLY REAL TO STAY WAY A- ISSUE WILDLIFE FIRST TO HELP DO THAT OR WITH ANY STATE BASED. SEEMS A GENERAL OF DUTY ON SOMETHING HAS PART HEALTH RISKS AND CAL SO WANTED TO SEE THE NECK AND THEN FORZA IN. OUR A- TO DO WHAT THEY DO. TO PREVENT THAT FROM TAKE ROOT. SO THIS YEAR IT DID EVERY FOR DO YOU HAVE TO PAY A LIST OF ANIMALS THAT MAY NOT BE IN OR TO INTO THIS. I WOULD INSTEAD REQUIRE THE DF NOW LATER THAN DECEMBER FIRST TWENTY TWO TO ESTABLISH A LIVE OF ANIMALS THAT MAY NOT BE PROCESS OR TRANSPORTED WITH THE STATE OF IMPORTED INTO THE STATE. IS IT SIR IS A QUESTION. ARE YOU READING FROM ANALYSIS YES YES IT THIS IN LIEU. IS THIS. I'M SORRY IS IT INCLUDES. YES IS IT IN LIEU SO INSTEAD OF PUBLISHING AB IT SAYS HERE THAT IT DELETES A REQUIREMENT FOR THE DFW TO PUBLISH A LIST OF ANIMALS BUT MAY NOT BE IMPORTED OR TRANSPORTED INTO THE STATE. AND WOULD INSTEAD REQUIRE THE DFW NO LATER THAN DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST ESTABLISH A LIST OF WILD ANIMALS THAT MAY NOT BE BUSINESS PROCESS TRANSPORT WITHIN THE STATE OR IMPORTED INTO THE STATE IS THIS CORRECT. IF YOU'RE READING SOMETHING ELSE JUST WOULD ASSUME. CREEK IN A WAY. TO THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT. ANDERSON. OKAY INTO FOR CLARITY FOR- THIS BILL REQUIRE- THE RECORD- THAT THESE BE IN IN THE LIST PRIOR TO BE FORMAL- ABOUT SURE THE WORD WOULD. FORMALLY DIDN'T DIE. TO BE THE CARRIERS OR JUSTICE. OF BEING CARRIERS. IF THERE'S A MAJOR PANDEMIC AND WE KNOW THAT CERTAIN ANIMALS OR CARING THAT DISEASE THAT'S WHEN THEY WOULD GET LISTED BASED ON A SIZING EVIDENCE SO WOULDN'T BE IT WOULDN'T SAY- THIS PART ANIMAL MAY HAVE COLLUDED. IT WOULD SAY THAT THEY A COPAY BREAK AMONG OR WHATEVER THEN KOBE GOING TO BE AMONG YOU KNOW THIS CLASSIC OF OR- THESE KINDS OF AVIANS ARE THESE KINDS BATS OR IN THE MAIL THESE PER MAN. AND THEN IT THAT RESTRICTED THEY WOULD END UP ON THAT WRIST SPEED LIST FROM THAT CDF FOR. AND THEN IF YOU KNOW IF YOU COULD THAT THERE'S NO LONGER A MAJOR OUTBREAK WE YOU GET A THAT THAT RESTRICTED LIST BUT IT'S ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE FOR. THIS IS BE A SORT OF CATCHALL WAY TO. A WHOLE WHOLE BUNCH OF ADAM- THIS IS ABOUT THERE HAS TO BE A NO- I FORGET I'LL GO BACK AND READ THE BILL BUT IT'S A- IT'S A NEW. UNKNOWNS. IT WOULD NOT ACT UPON THAT KNOWLEDGE. PASS ENOUGH IN THERE FOR IT WE HAVE A NEED FOR THIS PARTICULAR BILL THAT YOU SUBMITTED THAT'S MY ARGUMENT YEAH. I DON'T TO DEFER THAT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO YEAH. I MEAN WE DON'T THEY WE HAVE A PARTNERSHIP THERE SENATOR WE REALLY DIDN'T USED IN THE IN THE PAST WE'VE NOT. HAD A LOT OF- WE HAVE NOT HAD. OKAY AND LASTLY M. WOULD YOU MIND JUST. ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT- THE LEAD OPPOSITION FROM THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS PUBLIC AFFAIRS COUNCIL HAD. GIVEN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS. I YEAH I'LL HELP OF NOT REPETITIVE BECAUSE THEY ARE YOU KNOW SENATOR COM LOG ARRESTED SIMILAR QUESTION- LEAVING WANTED DID EVERY NEEDS TO BE BASED ON A PEER REVIEWED STUDY- AND THEY THEY WANTED TO POSITION NOT TO BE A PART OF THE BILL. AND I'M NOT SURE AND WE CAN GO BACK TO THE MATH IF YOU ARE ONE I AM REALLY IF THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE CHAIR HERE I WANT TO TAKE. HER TAKING WAY TOO MUCH TIME WITH THIS BILL- BUT- I'M HAPPY TO GO BACK TO THEM BUT I THINK THOSE WERE THE CENTRALISSUES- WE'RE GOOD ON STRIKING POSITION. THE PEER REVIEWED EVIDENCE I THINK IT IT JUST TAKES TOO LONG TO GET THAT KIND OF STUDY DONE AND IT'S REALLY NOT. WHAT IS THAT THE HOPE WE'RE LOOKING FOR WE WANT JUST SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE NIMBLE ENOUGH TO ADDRESS A MAJOR PANDEMIC OUTBREAK. SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE BASING ON SCIENTIFIC NOT THE PEER REVIEWED BUT AGAIN I'M I'M VERY UP FOR WORKING THROUGH ALL THAT WITH THE- WITH THOSE CONCERNS. THE SENATOR STERN. YEAH WIENER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- SO THIS IS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT I'M A LITTLE. LITTLE BIT CONFUSE AND SENDING OUT SOME CLARITY SO WHEN IT COMES TO AND WE KNOW THAT- VIRUSES- THAT'S WHERE FOLKS NOTING VIRUSES BUT ALSO CAN BE BACTERIA. CAN JUMP BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN SPECIES AND THAT'S ALWAYS. IN THE CASE OF DOMESTICATED ANIMALS AND WILD ANIMALS- AND IT'S- YOU KNOW WE KNOW. FOR EXAMPLE THAT HIV- CAME FROM- FROM A JUMP FROM WE THINK FROM HEAPS TO HUMANS- AND THEN STARTS TO SPREAD. THE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE OFTEN IT WOULD BE PROBABLY PRETTY EXCEPTIONAL THAT WE WOULD KNOW THAT. QUICKLY ENOUGH TO ISOLATE HER KEEP AWAY FROM THOSE ANIMALS BEFORE IT SPREADS SO WITH HIV I THINK IT HAD PROBABLY JUMPED DECADES. BEFORE WE EVEN KNEW WHAT HIV WAS I THINK IT WAS LIKE IN THE THIRTIES OR FORTIES SAY THEY THEY THANK BUT IT JUMPED FROM I THINK IT WAS CHIMPANZEES TO HUMANS. AND THEN WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HE SAID HE WAS UNTIL LIKE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHTY ONE. BY THE TIME WE HAD THE FIRST INDICATION SO MANY YEARS LATER OBVIOUSLY WAY TOO LATE TO DO ANYTHING- ABOUT CHIMPANZEES AND HIV- AND WITH CODED- YOU KNOW AT THE BEGINNING THERE WAS A- MEDIA SORT OF. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WAS A LITTLE BIT SPECULATIVE ABOUT THE WET MARKET AND- AND WHAT I UNDER ALL WITH DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT WHICH ANIMALS IT MIGHT HAVE COME FROM OTHER WAS FROM A DOCTOR FROM A PACK.-PANGOLIN THE FROM PRONOUNCING IT. CORRECTLY AND BY THE TIME AND FRANKLY BY THE TIME WE WERE EVEN TALKING ABOUT THAT CODE WAS ALREADY LIKE OUT THE GATES AND BECAUSE OF INCOMPETENCE. IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES INCLUDING OUR OWN- IT WAS ALLOWED TO SPREAD. SO I DON'T KNOW. HERE E. A LOT OF TIMES ONCE WE REALIZE THAT THERE ISN'T THAT THERE IS. A REASONABLE CHANCE THAT TAXONOMISTS IS THE SOURCE OF THE VIRUS THEY MIGHT BE. MONTHS OR YEARS OR EVEN DECADES LATER WHEN IT'S TOO LATE. TO STOP THE SPREAD. AND THAT. DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULDN'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BUT I JUST WANT A CERTAIN NOTE THAT- THAT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT LIKE A BROOM THE SENATE WAS DOING AND WE TO SEAL IT OFF AND IT'S FIXED OBVIOUSLY THAT. DIDN'T WORK WITH COVETED DIDN'T WORK WITH HIV- THE OTHER- HE SAYS OF IF YOU COULD MAYBE JUST BRIEFLY COMING UP IN THE P. SPECIFICALLY ON ON SECTION SEE- ONE IN THREE AYE AYE I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED BECAUSE THEY SEEM INCONSISTENT ONE OF THEM REFERS TO- THE WITH THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE SUGGESTS. SO IN OUR TRANSMISSION- RESPONSIBLE FOR A NOVEL NOT PREVIOUSLY REPORTED READILY TRANSMISSIBLE HUMAN DISEASE. AND THREE TALKS ABOUT JUST DISEASE- READILY. DISEASES IN GENERAL DOESN'T HAVE TO BE NOVEL SO WHY IS ARE YOU TIME A NOVEL DISEASES HERE. OR TALK ABOUT ALL DISEASES HERE- AND DOES IT HAVE TO ONLY BE A SERIOUS DISEASE- BECAUSE THERE COULD BE DISEASES THAT. COME FROM AN ANIMAL THAT ARE ARE VERY VERY VERY MINOR- AND SO I'M JUST CURIOUS IF YOU COULD. CLARIFY- THAT. SB TWO IF THAT'S WHAT IS I'M SORRY MR CHAIR. RIGHT HERE OKAY- MAYBE I DON'T KNOW IF BERNIE CUMMINGS IS STILL ON THE LINE MAYBE COULD BE COULD WEIGH AND I'M HAPPY TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF. EXTRA DETAIL BUT IF YOU'D INDULGE ME. YES I AM ON THE LINE. MR THE APPEARANCE. RIGHT HERE USER WITH THIS OKAY. YEAH THANK YOU YES FOR CLARITY ON WHAT THE BILL TRYING TO DO AND STOP OR START AN EARLIER QUESTION ON LIFE MARKETS VERSUS OTHER PARK- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT READ MORE BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE IS THAT A PORTION OF THE EXISTING LAW. DEALING WITH LIFE MARKETS IT'S PART OF THE PENAL CODE- THE QUESTION IS EXISTING LAW THAT DEALS WITH WILDLIFE IMPORT MORE BROADLY PART OF THE FISHING GAME AND THAT'S WHY THE BILL ANALYSIS THAT YOU THOUGHT. ABOUT THIS ON THE LIVE MARKETS PART IN- COMMITTEE EXISTING LAW ALREADY CREATE RESTRICTED SPEECHLESS I HAVE A PROVISIONS REQUIRE PROHIBITED SPECIES. THE RESTRICTED SPECIES LEFT UNDER EXISTING LAW TALK ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY THE PART OF THE LANGUAGE IN HERE IS TO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC HEALTH IS ALSO A FACTOR IN WHETHER OR NOT TO PUT A SPECIES ON THE RESTRICTED LIST AS WELL AS WEATHER CONDITIONS PERMIT OR NOT- THE PROHIBITED SPECIES LIST WHICH IS STRICTER- HAS NEVER BEEN IMPLEMENTED THAT'S WHY THE PORTION OF THE BILL THAT CUTS THAT DEADLINES IN THEIR- SEARCH SOMEONE ELSE QUESTION- IT THE MOST RECENT QUESTION OF THE DAY. THAT NUMBER ONE VERSUS NUMBER. THREE INFECTION FEET. I THE IDEA THAT IS IF THERE'S A SPECIES THAT'S BEEN DETERMINED TO BE CRITICALLY HIGHER. THAT THIS GIVE THE AUTHORITY TO ACTUALLY SUSPEND PERMITS YES IF THE ANIMALS ARE ALREADY CIRCULATING OUT THERE- OR IF THERE'S A PERMIT FOR MULTI YEAR. A PERMIT THAT ALLOW THAT ALREADY BEEN ISSUED THAT ALLOWS IMPORTATION BUT IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET THAT'S WHAT ONE IS ABOUT- PRINT THREE. IS THE IDEA THAT CERTAIN SPECIES ARE HIGHER RISK OR NOT. SO THAT THE COURT ON THE LAST THE IDEA IS YOU CANNOT. THEY'RE ON THE LIST THE REASON THAT THE- YOU CANNOT ISSUE A PERMIT UNLESS. THE ENTITY RECEIVING THEM HAS. THE ABILITY TO DO THE TREATMENT TESTING QUARANTINE THINGS OF THAT SORT- AND SO. IN THAT SENSE IT'S NOT A TRUE PROHIBITION IT'S A PROHIBITION. UNLESS YOU CAN DEAL WITH IT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE COMMONSENSE EIGHTY METRIC- AND THEN PERHAPS THAT THE LAST THING I WOULD TRY. TO CLARIFY ON THE QUESTIONNAIRE AS A. M. C. A. AZS EXEMPTION. AND AVIATORS BURKE A LARGE SUITS LIKE AND EAGER TARA THAT INDICATIVE LAW SO THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THAT ALL- THE END THAT THAT TAKES UNDER EXISTING. IS PART OF CALIFORNIA MANY STAY THAT CAN FEDERAL LAW- THAT'S LONG BEEN WRECKED WE DO NOT WANT TO CHANGE THAT AT A PRACTICAL MAN THE COME. BY THE SMALLER THE- CREATE ALMOST DOESN'T REALLY MATTER BE. THE AS THE ACRE EXISTING ADA. GOES AWAY FOR SPECIES THAT ARE. AT HIGH RISK AND SO THEY WILL NEED PERMITS TO SO REALLY THE OPPOSITION- ON THAT IS. YOU'RE NOT. NOT UNDERSTANDING THEIR- ADMITTEDLY COMPLICATED EXISTING LAW- ARE MISCHARACTERIZING I DON'T THINK IT WILL HAVE ANY OF THE IMPACTS THAT. THE GROUPS COMPLAINING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I BELIEVE THIS WHAT THAT WAS MISTER CUMMINGS RIGHT YES THANK YOU MR CAMERON IS COMING. ANOTHER WINNER DO YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. THE FINNER COME OVER THE QUESTIONS- YES PLEASE YEAH IF I COULD JUST BUT TO THE QUESTION ABOUT. LIKE HOW THIS WILL WORK IN PRACTICE AND HOW IT'S GOING TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND PRACTICE AND SOME OF MY EXAMPLES ABOUT. COVETED EVEN THOUGH IT WAS REASONABLY QUICKLY WE SUSPECTED BOTS ARE PANGOLINS ALTHOUGH WE DON'T KNOW REALLY WHERE I WAS COMING FROM AND THEN. DECADES AFTER JAPAN'S DEFEAT. ARE THERE ARE. SITUATIONS WHERE YOU THINK WE WOULD KNOW QUICKLY ENOUGH THAT TAKING THAT ACTION WOULD ACTUALLY. WHAT MAY MEANINGFULLY PROTECT HUMAN PUBLIC HUMAN HEALTH. I'M COMING TO GET HI OKAY TRY TO. YES LET ME AS THE CHAIR THE CHAIR IF THAT'S ALRIGHT IF YOU YES ABSOLUTELY OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. JERRY BROWN- YES YES HELLO AND IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES YEAH YOU KNOW THE- IT MAY BE TOO LATE BUT THERE ARE CATEGORIES OF SPECIES THAT WE KNOW ARE HIGH RISK PARTIAL BATHS WHICH- ALMOST CERTAINLY IS THE ORIGIN SOURCE OF HOPE AND HAVE IDENTIFIED BY THE RECENT WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION- REPORT- THOSE WOULD PROBABLY. THAT WHOLE CATEGORY PATH SHOULD PROBABLY BE PUT ON THE PROHIBITED SPECIES LEFT WHERE THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN IMPORT A LIFELINE IT EXPERT RESEARCH INSTITUTE IN THE US SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK AT THE PIZZA- FOR SPECIES LIKE THAT WE CAN PROACTIVELY DO. IF YOU LOOK BACK TOFACE BARS- ULTIMATELY LANCASTER SAID THAT- BUT IN A DAY IT MAY BE TOO LATE. TO STOP THAT PARTICULAR OUTBREAK BUT THAT WOULD ELEVATE THAT CATEGORY OF ANIMALS TWO ONE FOR HARBOR DISEASES. THAT ARE READILY TRANSMISSIBLE HUMANS THAT WOULD PUT THEM ON THE RESTRICTED LIST IF THEY'RE NOT ALREADY THERE AND YOU KNOW IT WOULD THEREFORE BE HARDER TO GET A PERMIT FOR SO IT IT. IT IS A DIFFICULT THING AND THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S THE BILL THAT JUST PASSED OUT FEDERAL LEVEL- DEVELOPS FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE BODY HOW BEST TO DO THAT- BUT- AMONG THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW HAVE BEN CALLED FOR BY THE WHL LOCATED. YEAH A BAN ON LIVE MARKETS FOR MANY SPECIES AND- MUCH GREATER RESTRICTIONS ON LIFE SPOTLIGHT TRADE MORE BROADLY THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL ATTEMPTS. TO DO IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS. OKAY THANK YOU CONTINUE HAPPEN. THANK YOU. THE QUESTIONS LOOKING. SPONSORED MISSED CHAIR I GUESS I JUST HAD A QUESTION GIVEN ALL OF THE- THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE COME UP FROM- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IF IT TOM. IF THE AUTHOR IS OPEN TO USING MORE TIME TO TRY TO ADDRESS THEM. SENATOR STERN CAN YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION. I'M SORRY USING MORE TIME HERE TODAY WELL NO NOT TODAY BUT MAYBE CONSIDERING MAKING THIS A TO YOUR BILL- I HAD NOT CONSIDERED THAT- YOU KNOW GIVEN THE GIVEN THE URGENCY OF THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS WORD JUST GETTING THROUGH I'M REALLY. I WOULD APPRECIATE. CONSIDERATION AND EVEN IF FOR SOME REASON YOU ALL SEE DON'T SEE FIT TO SUPPORT THE MEASURE THAT AND SEEK RECONSIDERATION AT THAT POINT BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT- THE MATTER AS SUFFICIENT URGENCY THAT IT IT PROBABLY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO WAIT WE SPENT TWO YEARS WORKING ON THIS BILL- LAST YEAR AND IT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SESSION IT MADE IT THROUGH BOTH HOUSES- WITH. MANY VOTES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL ON THIS COMMITTEE AND- MADE UP THE ASSEMBLY FOR WITH GARY SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT AND JUST DIDN'T GET TO OUR SIDE QUICKLY ENOUGH SO- I GET THAT NEW THINGS COME TO LIGHT BUT I'M HOPING THAT THE URGENCY THAT WAS PRESENT IN LAST SESSION REMAINS TODAY SO. EITHER WAY I THINK I'M I'M- I'M UP FOR A I'M UP FOR A VOTE. IF THAT'S THE WILL OF THE COMMITTEE. ARM FROM THE OPPOSITION IS MATT BROOCH STILL ON THE LINE. I AM I NEED TO KNOW WHAT AMENDMENTS- HE'S TOOK A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS WHAT AMENDMENTS ARE STILL LACKING IN ORDER TO REMOVE IT. YOUR OPPOSITION. MR HERE I THINK YOU KNOW I'M JUST A BIT OF HISTORY- WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING- AND ENGAGING COLLABORATIVELY WITH CENTER STERN'S. OFFICE TO HAND HIS STAFF YOU KNOW FOR THE LAST YEARS SO ON THE BILL- YOU KNOW FIRST WE ARE LOOKING FOR AN EXEMPTION FOR THIS FILM AND TELEVISION INDUSTRY WHICH HE YOU KNOW HE DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING I THINK THE EXEMPTION HE THOUGHT WHICH TO GRIND- WHICH YOU KNOW IT'S A LITTLE PERPLEXING ASK BECAUSE- I'M I DON'T THINK THAT. THERE'S ANY INTENTION HE'S MADE CLEAR IT'S NOT HIS INTENTION TO CATCH US BACK HOME AND WE DON'T THINK IT IS INTENTION. ALSO NOT AWARE OF THERE BEING AN ISSUE IN OUR TRANSMISSION OF DISEASES BEING A PROBLEM IN HOLLYWOOD OR SICK ANIMALS BEING A PROBLEM HOLLYWOOD AND SO WHAT WE WE'D COME BACK IN ACCURATE ASKED FOR HIS OFFICE MOST RECENTLY WITH BASICALLY AN AMENDMENT BIG CAPS. THE EXISTING AUTHORITY THAT PROTESTED WITH THE WITH THE DEPARTMENT STATE TO CREATE THIS LAST TIME BUT THAT WOULDN'T ADD NEW POWER THAT WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT COULD PROHIBIT THE POSSESSION OR TRANSPORTATION WITHIN THE STATE BECAUSE LIKE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT OUR MEMBERS DEAL. ENDS AND ARE ARE VERY WORRIED ABOUT AND I GUESS THERE'S A REAL CONCERN AMONGST OUR MEMBERS THAT THIS IS KIND OF THE YOU KNOW PROVERBIAL CAMEL'S DOES NOT I KNOW IT'S UNDER THE CLASS- AND THAT YOU KNOW IT WAS ABOUT WHAT MARKETS LAST YEAR. AND NOW IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S ABOUT YOU NOT A TRANSMISSION AND OUR MEMBERS ARE JUST WORRIED ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE- A JOB AT THE END OF THE DAY AND SO YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE SENATOR AND WE HAVE BEEN BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO GET OUR POSITION OUT THERE- ON RECORD AND WE WOULD LIKE TO BACK SECTION. SECTION THREE AND. SHOULD BE IN THURMOND AND- HI THAT WE PROPOSED TO BE. WE VISITED ADDED. STATUTES OKAY- AND WILLING TO WORK SENATE ON THIS TIME. ISSUE A PEER REVIEW I DON'T THINK WE'RE- WORD MARY DID THAT ALL WE JUST WANT TO SURE THEY HE IS A JUSTICE THAT. BORN OUT OF THE YOU KNOW SCIENCE AND THAT ISN'T CARBON. AND ISN'T USED TO START OF I YOU KNOW. POTENTIALLY- I REMEMBER. OUR CONSIDER STERN ON OUR TO HAVE GREAT CONCERNS BASED ON MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THIS BILL WAS FOR WHAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY CHEL IN LIGHT OF WHAT HAS JUST BEEN MENTIONED BY MR BURROWED WERE ARE YOU AND ADDRESSING THOSE CONCERNS I WAS ALSO AN IMPRESSION BY- FOLKS THAT ALL THE MOMENTS THAT WERE COMMITTED TO AND NOW TO RESOURCES I'VE GOT TO BE TAKEN TO IS THAT IN FACT. THE CASE CAN YOU CHECK THAT THAT MAY BE ONE OF THE OTHER ISSUES HERE IS WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME BETWEEN. COMMITTEES- TODAY TO GET THOSE. JOHN AND IN THE CRANK- IT WAS TOO LATE TO STOP RAGING IN THERE WAS NOTHING OPPORTUNITY ANALYSIS SO- BUT JUST TO BE CLEAR THAT THE PIECES OF THE AMENDMENTS WILL WORK WE WERE TAKING A COMMITTEES REQUESTING THAT IT TEAMSTERS REQUEST WE'RE REMOVING A THREE YEAR STATUTE ON OCCASIONS WERE ALLOWING A WARNING FOR FIRST VIOLATIONS ON A WET MARKET SIDE. WERE STATING THAT BASIS MUST BE ON SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE BASED ON CREDIBLE SCIENCE BUT AGAIN MR BROADEST POINT VERY OPEN THE WORKING THERE AS LONG AS IT'S TIMELY TO SENATOR WIENER'S POINT WOULD SUMMIT ONE ONCE I GET DELETED MANY MONTHS OR YEARS. OUT THAT THE TEACHERS REQUEST REMOVING POSSESSION FROM SECTION THREE OF THE BILL- AND ALSO AT THE REQUEST OF THE TEAMSTERS ARE MOVING IN THERE AT INTENT LANGUAGE- SOMEONE'S ENTERING RECEDING LIKE RELATED TO POSSESSION SO. I'M I'M HOPING WHAT I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE OTHER ELEMENTS ARE I DID HAVE A CONCERN WITH IT STRAIGHT OUT EXEMPTION JUST FOR ONE INDUSTRY WHERE UNITED WANTED CERTAIN INDUSTRIES ONE OF OR NOT WELL I'VE DEEPLY CARSHALTON ENTERTAINMENTS RENDON I THINK THAT WOULD BE. FAIR BUT I'M OPEN. MR PEROT. TO WHAT TAKE IF THOSE OF MY YOU JUST STAY IT WILL THAT ALLEVIATE YOUR CA. AND I MEAN I THINK THE ISSUE IS THAT SORRY GO AHEAD MISTER NOT GONNA ANSWER CAR CONSULTANT- ARE WE CAN WE IMPOSE THOSE AMENDMENTS HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE. YES REPORT THAT HE'S ALREADY TAKEN OMINOUS COMMITTEE SO THEY'LL CROSS OUT WITH THIS COMMITTEE IN ANY ADDITIONAL ONES THAT. I THOUGHT MR PEROT WAS SPEAKING YOU CAN'T YOU CAN NEED- AS A COMMITTEE CAN PUT ON OTHER AMENDMENTS IF THERE'S OTHERS I THINK IT TOOK CARE OF THE POSSESSION ISSUE THAT. MR BROADHEAD AND THEN A- AND THEN THE ISSUE ABOUT THE SCIENCE ALTHOUGH IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE STILL. THERE WERE TAKEN A STEP TOWARD THAT THE AUTHORS GIVEN THE MOMENTS THAT TAKE A STEP TOWARD THAT. AND THEN. WE'LL SEE IF THAT GOES FAR ENOUGH. TO I WANTED NO THE PROTECT THEM FROM THE AUTHOR ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE THOSE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS TO ALLEVIATE THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED BY MR BROUGHT. YES I THINK SO I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE GO THE EIGHTY COULD YOU CLARIFY ONE MORE TIME WHAT WHAT EXACTLY DOES WOULD BE I DON'T MEAN TO BELABOR THE SOME SARDINES. I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT YEAR IS IT OKAY IF I. ANSWER THAT QUESTION. YES MISS BROKE PLEASE ANSWER THE QUESTION. OKAY SO UNDER SECTION THREE THE BILL AMENDS SECTION TWO ONE ONE NINE OF THE FISHING GAME CODE ALREADY ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT TO PUBLISH A LIST FROM TIME TO TIME- YOU KNOW ANIMALS THAT CANNOT BE IMPORTED INTO THE STATE. I'M IN IT WE BELIEVE THAT UNDER LIKE EXISTING RIDE THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING THAT I THINK THAT MAYBE ONE OF THE SPONSORS DISAGREED BUT WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM OUR ANIMAL TRAINERS AND THE LOCALS THAT THEY ARE DOING THAT AND YOU KNOW THE DAY LANGUAGE IN SECTION THREE GOES BEYOND JUST POSSESSION A CRITICAL TRANSPORTATION WITHIN THE STATE. IT GOES TOWARDS COMING UP WITH THE LATEST- BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO OUR APPS COULD BE THAT THEN MANAGE TO SECTION THREE THAT HAVE TO DO IT- WHICH NOT ONLY ON IMPORTATION BUT ALSO PRODUCTION AND TRANSPORTATION WITHIN WORK TO THE STATE- BEAT BE STRUCK FROM THE BILL SO THAT THEY DEPARTMENT JUST HAS ITS EXISTING AUTHORITY. AND THEN ON THE ISSUE OF PEER REVIEW OUR SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH SENATOR STERN- ON SOMETHING. THAT MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THE STATUTORY DEFINITION OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE RIGHT IS THE- TERMINATION BEING MADE IN A WAY THAT YOU KNOW I'M DEBTS BEING ABLE TO BE CONFIRMED BY THE MORE THAN ONE ALL RIGHT SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL I DON'T I DON'T THINK WE REALLY HAVE AN IDEA WE JUST WANT THE CERTAINTY OF KNOWING. THAT THESE DECISIONS. AREN'T BEING MADE ARBITRARILY. TO FIND UNDERSTAND GROW YOU WANT TO STRIKE THREE AND LET THE KERN LAWS STANDARD AS IS AS IT RELATES TO THE THORNY OF FISHING GAME. I'M FISH WALLER YEAH. MR STERN ARE YOU AMENABLE TO TAKING ADAM EMINENT STRUCK IN THAT SECTION OUT. IF IT'S THE WILL OF THE CHAIR AND IT'S TO WILL IS HERE. THEN YES. AND OKAY AND AS IT RELATES TO THE GOOD FAITH EFFORT OF WORKING WITH SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND BETTER TO FIND THAT I GUESS YOU WILL HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD IF IT'S CHILLY THIS COMMITTEE HERE TODAY IS WE HAVE A COMMITMENT FOR ME TO DO THAT. YOU DO INDEED MISTER MAKER WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING- IS ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS IN REGARDS TO THIS MEASURE. IN CHINA- CENTER STERN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT DIFFICULTY AND- I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER ABOUT. A CONSULTANT ARE YOU CLEAR ON THE MOMENTS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE IN ASKING FOR GOING FORTH IN THIS COMMITTEE. YES I AM THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE HAD GIVEN ME THE OTHER MOMENTS IN WRITING AND THEN I UNDERSTAND THIS ONE SO THANK YOU CAN. UNDERSTANDING IN WHICH SENATOR WINNER. WE SHOULD THE SIDE DIALOGUE I THINK. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BRING YOUR FORWARD AND SPONSORS- I DO THINK THE BILL NEEDS- SOME WORK ON HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT. TODAY TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING AND THEN TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. WHEN IT'S ON THE FLOOR BUT I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE AUTHOR WILL BE ABLE TO WORK IT OUT. I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE A TO PASS AS AMENDED- BY THIS COMMITTEE- TO APPROPRIATIONS- MADAM. CONSULTED PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON B. THREE SEVEN SIX. SB THREE SEVEN SIX TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS BRADFORD HI I PROVIDE CHOI BOGUE. NOT NOT VOTING HI OKAY SO. TOBA II COM LONGER HI FROM LONGER AYE SKINNER. SKINNER AYE WIENER WIENER I'D BILLS. FIVE ZERO. FIVE ZERO FIVE ZERO LET MEASURES OUT HUNG CONGRADULATIONS CENTER STERN NEXT UP IS SENATOR ALAN WITH. HIS MEASURE SB. FORTY THREE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH. MISTER CHAIR. THIS COMMITTEE WILL REMEMBER VERY WELL BOTH THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN THE ENACTMENT OF TO LAWS POPULARLY KNOWN AS THE CALIFORNIA RISE ACTS THE COURSE WORK- WHERE THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR REPEATED AND- SERVER THE GOVERNOR LEGISLATURE DECIDED TO- TO GET RID OF DEMONSTRABLY INEFFECTIVE CRIMINAL AND SENTENCE IN CRIMINAL SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS THAT ADDED THREE YEARS OF INCARCERATION DEFENDANTS. FOR EACH PRIOR DRUG OFFENSE THAT WAS AS B. ONE EIGHTY WHICH IS THE FORMER CHAIR HOLLY MITCHELL'S BILL AND THEN ALSO AN ADDITIONAL ONE THAT- ADDED CENTER WIENER. I TOOK ACROSS THE FINISH LINE SB ONE THIRTY SIX- WHICH WHICH REPEALED THE ONE YEAR OF INCARCERATION FOR EACH PRIOR PRISONER FELONY. JAIL TERM. SAYS RECOMMENDED BY THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE ON REVISION PENAL CODE I THINK OUR OUR CENTER CALM UNDER SERVED ON THAT COMMISSION COMMITTEE. SB FOUR EIGHTY THREE WILL RETROACTIVELY APPLY THESE RISE ACCESS TO PEOPLE CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA JAILS AND PRISONS. WHO WERE CONVICTED PRIOR TO THEIR ENACTMENT. THERE'S A ROBUST BODY OF RESEARCH THAT FINDS IT LONG PRISON AND JAIL SENTENCES- REALLY DON'T HAVE A DEMONSTRABLE POSITIVE IMPACT ON PUBLIC SAFETY. ATTY WE CERTAINLY KNOW THEIR. THEIR INJURIES TO FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES TO. IN CAN OF COLOR. I OF COURSE YOU ALSO KNOW THAT ARE TURNING FROM ACROSS OUR FACE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS. NOW WHEN THEY TO FIND JOBS AND HOUSING AND THERE'S A LOT OF CHALLENGES WITH FAMILIES AND SOCIETAL REINTEGRATION- YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN STUDIES BY THE U. S. SENATE SEAT COMMISSION THAT FOUND THE RETROACTIVE APPLICATION OF SENTENCE REDUCTIONS IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM HAD NO MEASURABLE IMPACT ON RECIDIVISM RATES AND THAT'S- MOST RELEVANT TO THIS BILL. I THERE WAS AN ANALYSIS OF THE PRISON POPULATIONS IN MARYLAND MICHIGAN FLORIDA THEY CAME TO SIMILAR CONCLUSIONS. SO IT'S IN LIGHT OF THIS RESEARCH AND THE GUIDANCE OF A WIDE ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE. ON REVISION OF THE PENAL CODE THAT WE- WE BASICALLY COME FORWARD WITH THIS BILL THAT DEFIES THE LAW EQUALLY BY RETROACTIVELY REPEALING INEFFECTIVE THREE YEAR AND ONE YEAR SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS THAT WE'VE ALREADY REPEAL. MOVING FOR THE IDEA BEING THAT WE- HAD SO MUCH AND HAVE A MORE TIME IN PRISON JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE SENTENCED. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN INSTEAD OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- FOR THE EXACT SAME CRIME. AS SO IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR THOSE CASES MOVE. IT NOT A BIG ENOUGH- TO PLAY RETRACT IN THE COURSE THIS DOESN'T. CHANGE ANYTHING WITH A GOOD O THE- PRISON TERMS IN AND- IN ANYTHING WITH REGARDS TO OTHERS AND HANSON. THAT NOT ALREADY BEEN PROOF BY THE SIDE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I DON'T REALLY WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR. BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- WE- USING KNOWLEDGE OF THE BEGINNING MYSELF AND CENTER MITCHELL ANNOUNCE SUPERVISOR MITCHELL- CENTER SKINNER- YOU KNOW SOMEONE IN OUR CALL IS A WHOLE BIG GROUP EFFORT TO GET BOTH OF THOSE- CENTER BROUGHT THE CHAIR- BIG GROUP EFFORT TO GET BOTH OF THOSE BILLS- PAST- AND IT'S- JUST SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE THESE ENHANCEMENTS ARE. ABSOLUTELY FUELING MASS INCARCERATION AND THEY REALLY DON'T DO ANYTHING TO MAKE ANYONE SAFER- AND YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD DO THE TIME FOR THE FOR THE CRIME YOU TO BUT WE START STOCKING ON ENHANCEMENT AFTER ENHANCEMENT AND THEN ALSO TO. TWO OR THREE YEAR SENTENCE BECOMES AN EIGHT OR TEN YEAR SENTENCE AND COSTLY AND IT'S MAKES IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO REINTEGRATE- ONCE THEY COMPLETE THEIR SENTENCE. AND IT JUST MAKES. NO SENSE AT ALL AND SO WAS THAT WE'RE THEM IN A TENT. THAT YOU'RE- NOW BECAUSE THIS. FOR TO APPLY RETRO TO THOUGH ON ABOUT REQUESTED A CALL. PROCESS AND SO. I MOVED THE BILL. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION SENATOR WE ANY OF DISTANCE ASCRIPTION ON BASED ON THE ISSUE SO. THANK SOMEONE A THE AUTHOR CURING IT ALL WELCOME HIM TO THE- OR CALL CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM POLICY. AND BUT IT'S TRUE ONE. FIVE WHEN WE- CHANGE THE LAW GOING FORWARD. THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN REALLY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY WERE CONVICTED UNDER THOSE THINGS SO IN OTHER WORDS IF WE REALIZE THAT. THAT IT WHATEVER FOR WHATEVER REASON WE MADE AN ERROR IN OUR SENTENCING AROUND PARTICULAR FOR OUR THE WAY WE ARE BROUGHT A PARTICULAR PART OF THE PENAL CODE AND THEN WE CORRECTED TO HAVE OTHER PEOPLE LANGUISH THAT WERE SENTENCED PRIOR WHICH YOU OF COURSE MADE THAT POINT IN YOUR- COMMENTS IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE SO THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND APPRECIATE IT. I WILL BE SUPPORTING. GREAT THANK YOU JUST A QUICK COMMENTS QUESTIONS ON THIS MEASURE CENTER DROVE OFF. SO I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS AS. TO Y. V. THE NOTION OF. SEEKING TO REMOVE THESE- THESE- ENHANCEMENTS TO TREAT REPEAT OFFENDERS- IN MY MIND AND I I'M NEW IN A FAIRLY NEW TO THIS COMMITTEE HAS HEARD PRETTY NEAR THE PERSON EVERYBODY HERE BUT I JUST KIND OF CURIOUS AS TO. I WOULD THINK THAT IF IT'S A REPEAT OFFENDER. THE CONSEQUENCES SHOULD BE STRICTER. ON THAT AND NOT NOT LESS RESTRICTIVE ON THAT AND- I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC BEHIND THIS BILL- BECAUSE I IN MY MIND IT TO RELEASE IS NOT MAKING. SENSE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO REPEAT OFFENDERS I CAN I CAN. FENTON THE NOTION OF THE UNDERSTANDING OF A FIRST TIME OFFENDER BUT WITH REPEAT OFFEND WITH THE REPEAT OFFENDER. THE FIFTY TWO YEAR AND TOOK JUST TO CLARIFY CENTER ARE YOU WHEN YOU SAY YOU'RE TRYING TO SEND THIS BILL IN JUNE. R. J. A. U. GRAZING A CONCERNED ABOUT THE RISE ACTS LIKE A SPEED. ONE EIGHTY ONE THIRTY SIX OR OR IS IT IS YOUR CONCERN WITH. NOW THAT THOSE HAVE BEEN PASSED- WHICH SET THE STANDARD FOR REPEAT OFFENDERS. IT FILE IN A LIMITED WAY BECAUSE THERE'S OTHER WAYS THAT PEOPLE'S. DEFENDERS SENTENCES CAN CAN CERTAINLY BEING ENHANCE IT EVEN UNDER CURRENT LAW ALL WE'RE DOING HERE IS HE'S APPLYING THE EXISTING LAW RETROACTIVELY. SO THAT SO THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT. COULD BE GIVEN A OF A LONGER SENTENCE JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE CONVICTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AS OPPOSED TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SO NOW IF YOUR IF YOUR QUESTION IS ABOUT THE BROADER QUESTION WHY IT IS WE REPEALED- THE SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF REPEAT OFFENSE WE I MEAN I CAN WE CAN. HEAR YOU HAVE WE GOT SEVERAL PEOPLE ON THIS COMMITTEE YOU CAN SPEAK-ELOQUENTLY ABOUT- WHY IT WAS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR NASA THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE SENATE. I BELIEVE THAT IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE FOCUSED ON OR OR IS IT. YES SOME BOTH ON THAT ON THAT AND RETROACTIVELY AND BECAUSE I MEAN THIS IS. OBVIOUSLY A FOLLOW UP TO THAT BUT- IN ESSENCE IT'S STILL. YOUR ADDRESSING THE ISSUES OF REPEAT OFFENDERS RIGHT WOULD YOU DO WHAT DO WOULD YOU MIND IF I ASK OUR COLLEAGUE WHO WHO CARRIED THE BILL ON THIS- CENTER WINNER. ABSOLUTELY SO. SO FIRST OF ALL JUDGES ALREADY HAVE THERE'S A RANGE OF SENTENCES EVERY SET EVERY FELONY THEY COMMITTED AS A LOW MIDDLE AND HIGH ENDS WHERE THEY CAN SOLICIT MY IDEA I'M JUST MAKING THIS UP TO TWO YEARS THREE YEARS FOUR YEARS DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND SO THE JUDGE CAN ALREADY LOOK BACK AT SOMEONE'S RECORD IN ADDITION THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIME AND SIGNS ON THE HIGH END OF THE RANGE OR THE LOW END OF THE RANGE SUGGESTS JUDGES ALREADY HAVE DISCRETION. IN ADDITION WHEN YOU COMMIT A CRIME YOU HAVE THE SENTENCE FOR THAT FOR THAT CRIME AND THAT IS WHAT IT IS IF YOU ALREADY DID THE TIME FOR LAST CRIME THE THINKING AS IF YOU DID THE TIME WHATEVER THE LAW CENTER LAST CRIME. BUT SAY WHATEVER EITHER TEN YEARS LATER YOU COMMIT ANOTHER CRIME YOU DO THE QUOTE THAT THE TIME FOR THAT THESE ENHANCEMENTS WERE ESPECIALLY THE ONE YOU'RE IN HOUSING WHICH IS A BILL THAT I CARRIED TENDED TO BE FOR LOWER LEVEL OFFENSES BECAUSE FOR MORE HIGHER LEVEL OFFENSES- TO THE OTHER ENHANCEMENTS THAT ARE MORE SERIOUS SO WHAT THIS IS DOING WAS OFTEN TURNING LOW LEVEL CRIMES- INTO A VERY LONG SENTENCES ABOUT WAS THE IDEA. BEHIND REMOVING IT PEOPLE CAN STILL GET PRETTY YOU KNOW SERIOUS SET SENSORS FOR COMMITTING A FELONY BUT BUT YOU KNOW THE. THE THOUGHT IS. ACTING OUR PRISONS PEOPLE. YOUR CALIFORNIA WENT ON A- SPREE WERE WE WENT FROM PRISON OF THIRTY ONE PRESS. AMHERST OVER CROWD BECAUSE- INSTEAD OF HAVING RATIONAL SENTENCING WE DO A PUNISHMENT. EVERYTHING BECAUSE OF ENHANCEMENTS. WAS A REALLY LONG SENTENCE AND WAS PACKING OUR PRISONS AND- BUT IT JUST WASN'T WORKING SO THIS IS REALLY- ANTI MASS INCARCERATION MEASURE. YOU'RE FINE YOUR OKAY THANK YOU HOGG SOONER ALLEN I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR THIS MEASURE I THINK- ISSUES PROVEN THAT ENHANCEMENTS AS STATED BY PREVIOUS- A MEMBERSHIP OF THIS COMMITTEE- THROUGH VERY LITTLE IF ANYTHING AND- DETERRING CRIME. AND- WE JUST. FIND OURSELVES AGAIN WITH- HAVING ASKING PEOPLE TO SERVE LONGER. TIME IMPRISONED SOMETIMES FOR VERY MINOR OFFENSES AND YES MIGHT BE- REPEAT OFFENDERS BUT THERE INDIVIDUALS YOU'VE ALREADY DONE A TIME SHOWN THAT THEY HAVE MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT IN. TRYING TO REHABILITATE THEMSELVES AND I THINK THAT'S THE GOAL OF YOU KNOW WHY WE SEND PEOPLE TO PRISON AND- HOPING THAT THEY COME OUT BETTER BUT AGAIN ENHANCEMENTS DON'T CHANGE THE MINDSET OF SOMEONE WHO IS PLANNING ON COMMITTING A CRIME SHOW ARE. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORT IN CONTINUING- RESTORATIVE JUSTIN OPPORTUNITY SO ON ON THAT NOTE WE HAVE A MOTION DON'T ARE WE SEEKING A MOTION ON. DO PASS. TO APPROPRIATIONS- WE A MORE.

BURKE OFFICE IN NORTHWESTERN RUNDLE A YOU ARE BEING HEARD AND YOU CAN PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. OKAY I'LL START OVER. GOOD EVENING SHERMAN BRADFORD AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE SENATE BILL FOR TWENTY ONE. WHICH MAKES A NUMBER OF ENHANCEMENTS TO THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA MISSIONARY LOCK LAWS WHICH WILL SAVE LIVES. FROM THE PREVENTABLE TRAGEDIES OF IMPAIRED DRIVING. THE RECORD MY NAME IS DARREN D. GLENDALE VICE PRESIDENT OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS TRAFFIC SAFETY FOR THE FOUNDATION FOR DANCING OF COAL RESPONSIBILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY .ORG. ORGANIZATIONS JOINING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ARE THE COALITION OF IGNITION INTERLOCK MANUFACTURES. RECORDING ARTISTS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING WE SAVE LIVES DISTILLED SPIRITS COUNCIL OF THE UNITED STATES WERE DISCUSSED. RESPONSIBILITY DOT ORG IS A NATIONAL NOT FOR PROFIT THAT LEADS THE FIGHT TO ELIMINATE DRUNK DRIVING AND UNDERAGE DRINKING IS FOUNDED BY SOME OF THE LEADING STORES IN THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT DATA FROM THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION STATE HOLIDAY ANALYSIS REPORTING SYSTEM CALIFORNIA. IS ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR IMPAIRED DRIVING FATALITIES. DO YOU RATE YOUR TELEVISION CALIFORNIA HAVE INCREASED 8% OVER THE LAST DECADE AND GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. AND DRIVING IMPAIRED BY MULTIPLE SUBSTANCES AS AN EVER INCREASING PROBLEM WITH A HIGH RISK CRASH RISK. CURRENTLY THIRTY FOUR STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA REQUIRE IGNITION INTERLOCKS FOR ALL DELIGHT OFFENDERS SIMPLY PUT THE COMMISSION INTERLOCKS ARE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE COUNTERMEASURES AVAILABLE TO STOP DRUNK DRIVING BEFORE IT BEGINS. ADMISSION INTERLOCAL WIREIMAGE PROVIDE ACCOUNTABILITY IN PROACTIVELY STOP DELAY TRIPS FROM BEING INITIATED IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THEY MONITOR DRIVERS THROUGH THE DURATION OF THE TRIP. THIS IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENT THE CURRENT LAW HE CALIFORNIA ALLOWS OFFENDERS SOCIAL WORK AND FAMILY OBLIGATIONS WHILE PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. WE SEEM TO RESEARCH FINDINGS SHOW THAT BETWEEN FIFTY AND 75% OF SUSPENDED OR REVOKED RIGHT WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE. THE FLIGHT HELPS CLOSE THAT GAP AND MAKES CALIFORNIA ROADS SAFER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS AND LEADERSHIP TO REDUCE IMPAIRED DRIVING IN CALIFORNIA. MERGERS WITH PASSAGE OF SENATE BILL FOR TWENTY ONE INTO LAW THIS YEAR IT WILL PREVENT DELIGHT REDUCE CRASHES AND SAVE LIVES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR RUNDELL AND WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO OUR FIRST LEAD WHICH- WITNESS IN SUPPORT. MERRY CLOTS BACK ARE YOU ON THE LINE. I AM WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY MA'AM. YES PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MERRY CLASS BOX I AM A LITTLE MORE RESIDENT FORMER NATIONAL BOARD MEMBER OF MOTHERS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR TWENTY ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR OFFERING THIS LIFESAVING PROPOSAL SB FOUR TWENTY ONE HONORS THE WISH THE GOVERNOR TO FINE TUNE. SB. THIRTY TWO THIRTY FOUR TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR DRUNK DRIVERS. THE FLOOD DISTRICT LEAD VERY PERSONAL. I HAVE WORKED ON REFORMING DRUNK DRIVING OFFENSE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. AFTER CLASS BALK IF MY SON IS GONE TODAY BECAUSE THE REPEAT DRUNK DRIVER CHOSE. TO DRIVE DRUNK AGAIN THIS TIME ON A SUSPENDED LCENSE MEANT TO KEEP THEM OFF THE ROAD. HELLO MY FIFTY TWO PORT ONE AUTHORED BY SENATOR BRADFORD COULD HAVE SAVED MY SON'S LIFE. ALLOWED TO MOVE FORWARD SB FOUR TWENTY ONE WILL SAVE AND CHANGE LIVES. IT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT MOST FIRST TIME DRUNK DRIVERS DO NOT BECOME REPEAT OFFENDERS. TODAY MOST FIRST TIME OFFENDERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ALLOWED TO DRIVE WITHOUT PROVIDING PROTECTION TO THE PUBLIC. WE KNOW WE CAN'T JUST SUSPEND LICENSE AND HOPE FOR THE BACK. UP 275% OF OFFENDERS CONTINUE TO DRIVE ON A SUSPENDED LICENSE. WITH CURRENT LAW WE ARE HOPING. THEY WON'T MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN HOPE IS NOT A STRATEGY THAT IS A RECIPE FOR RECENT EVENTS IN AND DAY OUT. SB FOUR TWENTY ONE WILL PROVIDE A MUCH NEEDED OPPORTUNITY FOR REHABILITATION. FOR THE FIRST TIME DRUNK DRIVERS ENTERING INTO THE DIVERSION PROGRAM. ADMISSION INTERLOCKS HAVE PROVEN. TO BE A POWERFUL TOOL FOR REHABILITATON AND BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION. PEOPLE LEARN THAT THEY CANNOT DRINK AND THEN ATTEMPT TO DRIVE. A DIVERSION COMPOSED OF SB FOUR TWENTY FOUR AND CREATES A FRAMEWORK FOR DIVERSION TO BE IMPLEMENTED STATE WIDE. VERSION WITHOUT THESE GUARDRAILS IS CURRENTLY THE LAW. IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO UNLESS SB FOUR TWENTY ONE BECOMES LAW. FOR FIRST TIME OFFENDERS. IN A NON INJURY CRASH DIVERSION ALLOWED A SECOND CHANCE. WITHOUT GUARDRAILS PARTICIPANTS AND DIVERSIONS ARE SET UP TO FAIL AND BECOME REPEAT OFFENDERS. SB FOUR TWENTY ONE RANDAMIE REMEDY THIS FAILURE TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ARE ABLE TO HAVE THE OPTION OF. DIVERSION WITH UNIFORM STANDARDS. WHY DRUNK DRIVING IS ONE TWO.

RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK SENATOR BRAD. DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON SB. FOUR TWENTY ONE. THANK YOU SENATOR KAMLAGER THE MOTION HAS BEEN MOVED- COUNCIL OF MADAME CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SB FOUR TWENTY ONE BRADFORD DO PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS BRADFORD. BRADFORD I'D SHOW BOOK ALREADY- OVER GUY COME LONGER. ORDER I SKINNER HI SKINNER AYE WE- WIENER. FIVE TWO ZERO. FIVE RIGHT FOR MAKING PRO YOU HAVE A COUPLE CYCLE. SB FIFTY THREE LEYVA. OKAY S. B. FIFTY THREE LEYVA- IT MEASURES ON PAUL BUT- AM I CORRECT IN- AS CENTER LABOR ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PASSED OVER BY- CENTER SKINNER INCOME UNDER. NO SHE BUT BEFORE WE LEFT BEFORE WE TOOK THE BOAT SHE TAKEN SOME OTHER AMENDMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE BUT SHE HAD NOT TAKEN THE ONES THAT IT'S SENATOR SKINNER AND KAMAGRA TALKED ABOUT AFTER THE THIRD RULE WAS LIFTED. THROUGH WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO INCORPORATE THOSE AMENDMENTS TO GOING FORWARD. CENTER SKINNER SO WHILE IN THE DISCUSSION- WE. WELL I I'LL EXPRESS I EXPRESS THAT I REALLY DIDN'T WANT- IT TO FUNCTION AS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE AGAINST A JUVENILE ESPECIALLY THE FIRST TIME AND WEATHER- THE AUTHOR WOULD. YOU BE WILLING TO CONSIDER THAT KIND OF CHANGE AND WHAT- BECAUSE I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO SAY WOULD YOU KNOW WOULD YOU ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS MEMORY NOW- BASICALLY SHE INDICATED SOME WILLINGNESS BUT YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T GET INTO A WHOLE LOT OF DETAIL BUT THEN- IN. IN CHECKING WITH STAFF AND SUCH. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE OUR CONSULTANT CONFIRMED THAT WE COULD GET YOU THE CHAIR COULD ASK THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. TO TAKE SUCH AN AMENDMENT. BUT IF THERE WERE. OTHERS BUT WE SPECIFICALLY AT LEAST I SPECIFICALLY WAS RAISING THE ISSUE AROUND JUVENILES- THE GOVERNOR- BY TWO RAISED QUESTIONS AROUND- JUVENILES AND ALSO- THE CRIMINAL PROVISIONS THERE WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT CRIMINAL VERSUS CIVIL IN THE AUTHOR EXPRESSED THAT THE INTENT OF THE BILL WAS TO NOT JUST HAVE IT ALLOW- FOR- NOT JUST ALLOWED TO BE A CIVIL CRIME. BUT THE- SO I DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THAT I HAVE CONCERNS WITH ADDING NEW CRIMES- I HAVE CONCERNS WITH TREATING JUVENILES AS ADULTS- THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME CONFUSION BETWEEN IF THE FIRST IS A MISDEMEANOR AND THE SECOND IS AN INFRACTION- ED. AND THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT- A WARNING FOR JUVENILES AND SOME OTHER KIND OF- YOU KNOW CYBERBULLYING TRAINING OR SOMETHING THROUGH A SCHOOL OR SOME OTHER DEPARTMENT RATHER THAN CREATING A NEW PIPELINE FOR- BOTH JUVENILE BOYS AND GIRLS- TO ENTER INTO AS A RESULT OF THIS. BUT- THE DECISION IS UP TO THE CHAIR. ON THE NEXT STEPS BECAUSE THE AUTHOR WAS NOT HERE. IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS AROUND ACCEPTING ANY OF THESE SO MISS KENNEDY CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE PROCESS IN WHICH WE NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO ASSURE THAT THOSE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE- REYES THAT BEING FOR THE FIRST TIME OFFENSE BE A WARNING. AND ONLY A FRACTION FRACTION FOR THE SECOND TIME OFFENSE AND THAT THOSE AMENDMENTS FOR SB FIFTY THREE WOULD BE TAKEN AN APPROACH IS A WEEK I MEAN THE AUTHOR WE CAN'T FORCE APPROPRIATIONS INSTRUMENTS BUT WE CAN EXPRESS THAT THAT THESE ARE THE THAT ARE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE THEM TO TAKE THOSE AND APPROPRIATIONS AND- TALK TO THE APPROPRIATIONS CONSULTANT AND TALK TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE ABOUT AGREEING TO THAT. IS THAT THE PLEASURE OF THIS BODY. I SEE EVERYBODY BOB THEIR HEAD SO- WE WOULD ASK THE APPROPRIATIONS CONSULTANT TO CONSIDER- I WILL RESTATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT- FIRST TIME OFFENSES BY JUVENILES PIECE SOLELY A WARNING. AND THAT THE SECOND OFFENSE IF THERE IS ONE IS AN INFRACTION THE CORRECT. IF WE ARE DREAMING OF THAT- THAT WE HAVE A MOTION I GUESS. WELL WE ALREADY AND I FIFTH AVE IS OUT I THINK- AND I DO AND I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT EARLIER THAT STARTING WITH A WARNING ESPECIALLY WITH KIDS COULD BE GOOD BUT- BUT I'VE EVER MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO START WITH A CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR WHO IS A VERY. REASONABLE PERSON. HOPEFULLY CAN BE PROPS EVEN AUTHOR- IN A PART. THE THING THAT ROLE ON THE MEASURE RIGHT YES OKAY LOOK RIGHT NOW IT'S A CHOI BOGUE AND SKINNER VOTING AYE SO BRADFORD.
