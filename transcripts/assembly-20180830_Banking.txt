THANK YOU AYE MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AB TWO THREE SEVEN WOULD EXPAND ACCESS TO SAFE CONSUMER LOANS BY RAISING THE UPPER LIMIT OF LOANS AVAILABLE UNDER THE PILOT PROGRAM. TWO SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AYE SOME OF THE MAIN PROTECTIONS INCLUDING THE PILOT PROGRAM THAT DO NOT EXIST UNDER CFL INCLUDE INTEREST RATES CAPPED AT 36%.

EXPANDING THE UPPER LIMIT A PILOT PROGRAM TO SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED WOULD PROVIDE RELIEF TO CONSUMERS BY MAKING LOANS OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AVAILABLE UNDER THE PILOT PROGRAM. AB TWO THREE SEVEN CLICK THE COST RECOVERY MEASURE THAT ALLOWS DB A CHARGE LICENSEES AN ADDITIONAL FEE FOR THE PURPOSES OF RECOVERING THE COST OF CONDUCTING FINDER EXAMINATIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY ABOUT. THANK YOU I'M. ANY AND FOLKS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. CHRIS ROSE ON BEHALF OF THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP AN INSECT IN SUPPORT THANK YOU [inaudible] ANYBODY ELSE [inaudible] ANY OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. MY CAN USING HERE ON BEHALF OF OPPORTUNE. PUTIN IS THE PREMIER SMALL DOLLAR RESPONSE WAS MODEL UNDER IN THE IN THE STATE -- AND AND WE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE AUTHOR IS ATTEMPTING TO DO HERE WE JUST HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT. I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST JUST TRY TO BE REALLY BRIEF AND JUST TALK ABOUT A COUPLE THINGS THAT WE KNOW IN A COUPLE THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW -- THIS BILL WAS HERE BEFORE THIS BODY -- JUST ABOUT A YEAR AGO -- AND THERE WERE LOTS OF QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS LEGITIMATELY SO -- THIS BILL SEEKS. TO TAKE A PARTICULAR LENDERS MODEL. AND PROVIDE IT WITH -- SPECIALIZED TREATMENT THIS IS A SINGLE COMPANY BILL AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S A DEBATABLE POINT -- THIS COMMITTEE WILL NOT HAVE ANY INPUT. ON WHAT THIS BILL SHOULD LOOK LIKE WE DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARILY THE BEST WAY TO DO POLICY. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE LOANS THAT ARE MADE BY FINDERS CURRENTLY. ARE UNDER THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CAPSULE WE DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS ANY COMPELLING REASON. TRIPLE THE SIZE OF THE LOANS THAT CAN BE DONE UNDER IT. NO DATA FROM THE REGULATOR APARTMENT BUSINESS OVERSIGHTS. WE JUST THAT THERE'S SOME CHALLENGING PIECES RELATED TO LOANS THAT ARE ORIGINATED BY FINDERS ONLY JUST PROVIDE A COUPLE OF THEM. DB A DATA SAYS THAT ONLY SIX PRINTS 16% OF THE LOANS. THAT ARE MADE OF BY FINDERS UNDER THE PILOT ARE DONE IN LOW TO MODERATE INCOME COMMUNITIES. AS OPPOSED 263% A LOANS ORIGINATED BY NON FINDERS -- THE POINT OF THE PILOT WAS TO DO -- TO GET ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE CAPITAL IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND WE DON'T WANNA THINK THIS DATA SUGGEST THAT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING WITH FINDERS. THE DATA SUGGEST THAT COULD SCORE BUILDING THAT HAPPENS -- OUT WITH FINDER LOANS IS DRAMATICALLY LESS THAN THE CRITICAL THE CREDIBILITY THAT HAPPENS OUT WITH LOANS MADE BY NON ORIGINATED ONCE. SO THAT'S WHAT WE KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS I'M. YOU KNOW WHAT'S WITH THESE FINDERS ARE INTERESTING AND COLLECT A COLLECTION OF OF FOLKS THEY INCLUDE PAYDAY LENDERS CHECK CAPTURES. A FURNITURE STORE OF A GOLD A GOLD BUYING PLACE THAT SO THAT'S ALWAYS KIND OF CONCERN JUST AS WELL BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON THAT WE DON'T KNOW. IF PILOT LOANS ARE BEING USED AS YOU KNOW THE BAIT IN A BAIT AND SWITCH WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS CROSS SELLING GOING ON WE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS ENABLING. AND THIS HASN'T REALLY BEEN LOOKED AT AND NOW WE'RE GONNA TRIPLE THE SIZE THE LOANS THAT HAPPEN HERE -- AT THIS POINT I THINK THAT'S SUFFICIENT WE'VE WE'VE ESTABLISHED. OUR CONCERNS -- WE WISH OF THIS BILL WAS IN THAT THERE WAS A MUCH MORE ROBUST. THOUGHTFUL A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM OF ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND PREDATORY LENDING. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MADAM CHAIR MEMBER SCOTT GOVERNOR BEHALF CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION -- WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT PILOT PROGRAM LOOKED AT HOLISTICALLY SEE WHAT'S WORKING WHAT ISN'T WORKING BEFORE WE EXPAND THAT I HAVE MEMBERS WHO ARE CAPPED AT THERE'S SOME PROVISIONS WITHIN THE PILOT PROGRAM WHICH MAKE IT APPEALING. WE'D LIKE TO LOOK AT THOSE -- TO PERHAPS TWEAK THE PROGRAM BEFORE WE EXPAND IT. I RYAN FLANAGAN I'M I ON BEHALF OF LANDMARK FINANCIAL SERVICES IN OPPOSITION. JOHN NOR WITH ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER CREDIT INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION ALSO POST THANK YOU -- MICHAEL SIR GOES ON BEHALF OF CENTRAL VALLEY LATINO MAYORS ELECTED OFFICIALS COALITION IN OPPOSITION ALSO LATIN BUSINESS ASSOCIATION [inaudible] THANK YOU.

HE WON'T TAKE A VOTE I'M GOOD WITH THAT TOO I JUST I JUST DO WANT TO POINT OUT ONE THING BECAUSE IT WAS SAID. TO TWO THINGS REALLY THE OPPOSITION ARE PEOPLE WHO I AM IT'S FUNNY THAT THEY CALL IT A SYMBOL. A COMPANY. BILL BECAUSE THEY'RE ACTUALLY ALL THE COMPETITION WAS UP HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE SINGLE COMPANY BILL BECAUSE THEY ALSO OPERATE THE SPACE BUT WHAT THIS DOES IS ACTUALLY PROVIDES A CAP. IF THE INDUSTRY ITSELF MEMBERS OF THIS PILOT PROGRAM WILL IT HERE TO THIS 36% CAP THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET ALL YEAR. IN THIS COMMITTEE FOR SOME TYPE OF LOAN. YES THEY CAN USE FINDERS CAN USE FINDERS WE DON'T HAVE TO IN FACT -- THAT THE FOLKS WHO WHO TESTIFIED AGAINST IT DON'T USE FIGHTERS BUT THEY ALSO DO TRIPLE DIGIT LOANS. THESE FINDERS SO HAVE TO BE WERE ENTITIES ARE REGISTERED WITH THE D. BO. AB IT TO IT LICENSED AND THEY HAVE TO ADHERE TO SPECIFIC ACTIVITY DISTURBING FACTUAL PREPRINT MATERIALS THEY CAN'T PROVIDE COUNSELOR VII'S -- THEY CAN -- IT YOU KNOW THERE'S BACKGROUND CHECKS WRITTEN INTO THE BILL SO CLEARLY WE'VE ALSO LOOKED ON THE DB A WEBSITE AND CAN'T FIND ANY COMPLAINTS AGAIN FIGHT AGAINST FINDERS. SO TO SUGGEST SOMEHOW THIS IS A BAD MODEL JUST BECAUSE WE WE JUST DON'T KNOW THEY'RE NOT REGISTERED BROKERS WILL THAT'S HOW WE CAN KEEP THIS UNDER 36%. AND WE CAN PROVIDE IMMIGRATION SERVICES AND FUNERALS IN THINGS THAT COST MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AT A REASONABLE RATE FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A CREDIT SCORE BUT HAVE A GOOD JOB.
