WITH THE LITTLE HISTORY STORY.

01:05:46.542 --> 01:05:49.378
THE CRANE GAINED ITS FREEDOM

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:57.620
FROM RUSSIA NINETEEN NINETY ONE. AND THE CURRENT MILITARY

01:05:57.687 --> 01:06:01.290
GENERATIONS. I GREW UP IN

01:06:01.357 --> 01:06:04.193
FREEDOM. THEY'RE NOT GONNA GO

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:07.530
DOWN. AND HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO

01:06:07.596 --> 01:06:11.400
HAPPEN. I DID TWO COMBAT TOURS

01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:13.736

THIS. SO WHAT YOU MAY SEE IN

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:22.978
UKRAINE. IS THE INVASION OF

01:06:23.045 --> 01:06:25.948
AFGHANISTAN BY RUSSIA IN

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:30.419

COLLEAGUE FROM MAJOR CORDOVA FOR

01:10:51.847 --> 01:10:53.048
BRING YOUR FOR I'LL BE BRIEF I

01:10:53.115 --> 01:10:55.117
DON'T KNOW IF I'VE EVER SAID

01:10:55.184 --> 01:10:56.518
THIS BEFORE THE FLOOR BUT I

01:10:57.219 --> 01:10:58.354
WHOSE YEAH SICKLY WITH MY

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.155

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:03.892
RARE. MOMENT OF BIPARTISANSHIP

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:05.160
WHICH I THINK IS SO IMPORTANT.

01:11:05.227 --> 01:11:06.495
BECAUSE WHAT WE ARE WITNESSING

01:11:06.562 --> 01:11:08.097
IS HE SAID THIS IS NOT JUST AN

01:11:08.163 --> 01:11:09.865
ATTACK ON A SOVEREIGN NATION

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:11.333
IT'S NOT JUST AN ATTACK ON A

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.935
SOVEREIGN PEOPLE. IN A

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:14.336
DEMOCRACY. THIS IS AN ATTACK ON

01:11:14.403 --> 01:11:15.571
THE FUNDAMENTAL WORLD ORDER.

01:11:15.638 --> 01:11:16.905
IT'S AN ATTACK ON THE IDEA THAT

01:11:16.972 --> 01:11:18.140
COUNTRY SHOULD NEGOTIATE THROUGH

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:20.409
DIPLOMACY. I COME TO AGREEMENTS

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:22.511
AND A CO EXIST PEACEFULLY. THIS

01:11:22.578 --> 01:11:24.413
IS THE IDEA THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:25.347
IS ADVANCING THAT BECAUSE HE HAS

01:11:25.414 --> 01:11:27.783
POWER. BECAUSE HE HAS AN ARMY

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:29.151
BECAUSE HE FEELS LIKE DOING

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:31.120
SOMETHING THAT HE CAN TAKE OVER

01:11:31.186 --> 01:11:32.755
AND OCCUPY ANOTHER COUNTRY. THAT

01:11:32.821 --> 01:11:34.423
HE CAN EXERT HIS WELL ON THAT

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:36.425
COUNTRY. AND THIS IS NOT. AS WE

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:38.227
HAVE LEARNED IN HISTORY. WHEN

01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:40.663
DICTATORS DO THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:41.463
THEY MUST BE MET WITH STIFF

01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:43.332
RESISTANCE. AND I'VE BEEN SO

01:11:43.399 --> 01:11:45.467
HARD TO SEE THAT IN. ICONIC

01:11:45.534 --> 01:11:47.436
PLACES AROUND THE WORLD LIT UP

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:52.207
PRIDE ANNOYS WALKING HOME THE

01:11:52.274 --> 01:11:54.576

COLORS OF YOUR TRAINING FRIDAY.

01:11:58.313 --> 01:12:00.883

01:12:00.949 --> 01:12:02.651
MESSAGE OF. ALLY SHIP. AND

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:03.786

THAT WE HAVE SEEN FOR THE

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:08.090
UKRAINIAN PEOPLE. THERE SHOULD

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:09.658

THEM. AND WE HAVE BEEN

01:12:17.366 --> 01:12:18.834
INCREDIBLY IMPRESSED BY THEIR

01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:20.936
BRAVERY AND THE COURAGE AND THE

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:22.538

EVERYBODY WANTS PEACE. BUT I

01:12:32.314 --> 01:12:33.615
THINK THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:35.317
THAT WE BACK UP OUR WORDS OF

01:12:35.384 --> 01:12:37.052
SOLITARY WITH MEANINGFUL ACTION.

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:38.287
IT WAS VERY PROUD TO SEE THE

01:12:38.353 --> 01:12:40.055

01:12:40.122 --> 01:12:41.623
INTRODUCED. LEGISLATION TO USE

OUR MORAL POWER. TO STAND UP TO

01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:48.063
THE PUT REGIME. I WAS HARD TO

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:49.064
SEE THAT OUR GOVERNOR IS

01:12:49.131 --> 01:12:50.165
SUPPORTING THOSE EFFORTS. WE

01:12:50.232 --> 01:12:51.300
HAVE THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST

01:12:51.366 --> 01:12:53.001
ECONOMY AS WAS MENTIONED. WE

01:12:53.068 --> 01:12:54.970
HAVE A LARGER ECONOMY THAN

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:55.971
RUSSIA. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO

LEADERSHIP. TO REINFORCE IN A

01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:01.410
VERY SIGNIFICANT WAY U. S. AND

YOUR REMARKS- ALL WEEK I'VE HAD

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:44.953
THIS PHRASE IN MY MIND. A LONG

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:47.389
BEGINNING A MOMENT WE DO NOT

01:13:47.456 --> 01:13:49.224
ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT IS THE COURSE

01:13:49.291 --> 01:13:50.492
OF WHAT WILL TRANSPIRE IN

01:13:50.559 --> 01:13:54.363
UKRAINE. WE ONLY KNOW EACH DAY

01:13:54.429 --> 01:13:56.799
WE FIND WHAT IS THE LATEST IT IS

01:13:56.865 --> 01:13:59.635
THIS LONG BEGIN A MOMENT IT IS A

01:13:59.701 --> 01:14:02.204
MOMENT WHERE. I KNOW. SACRAMENTO

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:04.273
COUNTY BUT THROUGHOUT OUR STATE

01:14:04.339 --> 01:14:05.474
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD I THINK.

01:14:05.541 --> 01:14:07.676
THERE ARE MANY FAITHS. THE

01:14:07.743 --> 01:14:10.913
PEOPLE CENTER THEIR LIVES AROUND

01:14:10.979 --> 01:14:12.014
. BUT I KNOW FOR ALL OF THEM

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.183
THIS IS SURELY A TIME WHEN THEY

01:14:14.249 --> 01:14:16.485
SORT OF GO BACK TO THEIR

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:17.119
FOUNDATIONS I THINK ABOUT WHAT

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:19.221
TRULY MATTERS AND- FOR THE

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:21.156
STUDENTS OF THE BIBLE IN THE

01:14:21.223 --> 01:14:22.658
UKRAINIAN FAITH. THERE ARE MANY

01:14:22.724 --> 01:14:24.426
PHRASES THAT COME TO MIND BUT

01:14:24.493 --> 01:14:26.829
THERE'S ONE THAT STANDS OUT YOU

01:14:26.895 --> 01:14:28.597
CANNOT ABIDE A SITUATION WHEN

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:31.099
PEOPLE SAY PEACE PEACE BUT THERE

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:33.235
IS NO PEACE. SO I THINK THAT IS

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:35.504
THE MOMENT OF THE MODERN AGE

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:36.205
FINDS ITSELF IN LOOKING AT WHAT

01:14:36.271 --> 01:14:38.207
IS TRANSPIRING. NOT WISHING TO

01:14:38.273 --> 01:14:40.642
HAVE OUR APCAR APPLE CARTS OF

01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:42.978
PEACE UNSETTLED. REALLY SAY WHAT

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:47.282
IS THE PATH OF PEACE. AS A- WE

01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:48.517
