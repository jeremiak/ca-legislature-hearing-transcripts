BILL AS IT'S ACTUALLY SORT OF

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.568
THING THAT I THINK MOST OF OUR

00:27:16.634 --> 00:27:18.303
CONSTITUENTS WOULD LIKE US TO DO

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:20.872
GENERALLY. TO ENCOURAGE THAT WE

00:27:20.939 --> 00:27:23.308
REMAIN A A STATE.

00:27:23.375 --> 00:27:26.277
OF LAW GOVERNED BY LAW.

00:27:26.344 --> 00:27:28.346
AND THAT SOMEBODY IS PAYING

00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:30.682

AS WE ADOPT STATUTES.

00:27:39.057 --> 00:27:40.925
WE CAN FOR AUTHORITY TO AGENCIES

00:27:40.992 --> 00:27:42.460
TO ADOPT REGULATIONS AND THEY

00:27:42.527 --> 00:27:45.730
HAVE DONE THAT THERE'S PROBABLY

00:27:45.797 --> 00:27:46.364
THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THOUSAND PAGES

00:27:46.431 --> 00:27:48.700
OF REGULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:27:48.767 --> 00:27:52.537
AND THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS.

00:27:52.604 --> 00:27:54.305
THAT ALL AGENCIES A STATE

00:27:54.372 --> 00:27:56.307
GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT

00:27:56.374 --> 00:27:58.676
THEIR REGULATIONS. TO ENSURE

00:27:58.743 --> 00:27:59.444
THAT THEY ARE STILL.

00:27:59.511 --> 00:28:00.912
UP [inaudible]

00:28:00.979 --> 00:28:02.447
CURRENT.

00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:04.082
NOT CONFLICT WITH OTHER BODIES

00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.883

00:28:06.484 --> 00:28:07.786
PURPOSE.

00:28:07.852 --> 00:28:08.887
IT'S REALLY DESIGNED TO MAKE

00:28:08.953 --> 00:28:10.388
SURE OUR LAW IS A LIVING THING

00:28:10.455 --> 00:28:12.524

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:13.491
RULES THAT ARE OUT THERE.

00:28:13.558 --> 00:28:15.293

IN THIS BACKGROUND A LITTLE BIT

00:28:20.498 --> 00:28:21.833
I ACTUALLY DO THINK THAT THIS

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.401
JUST FUNDAMENTALLY SOUND GOOD

00:28:23.468 --> 00:28:25.737
GOVERNMENT IT IS AN IDEA THE

00:28:25.804 --> 00:28:27.072
REPEAL OF MOST CALIFORNIANS.

00:28:27.138 --> 00:28:29.541
ARM.

00:28:29.607 --> 00:28:31.376
FROM A VERY PERSONAL STANDPOINT

00:28:31.443 --> 00:28:33.378
MY WIFE WHO WORKS AS A CHURCH

00:28:33.445 --> 00:28:34.879
BOOKKEEPER.

00:28:34.946 --> 00:28:35.713
HAD AN AGENCY OF STATE

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:36.448
GOVERNMENT THE BOARD OF

EQUALIZATION SEND THE LETTER

00:28:37.715 --> 00:28:39.284
TELLING THEM THAT THEY HAD TO

CONFORM BOARD OF EQUALIZATION

00:28:44.222 --> 00:28:45.623
RULES.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:48.093
AND MY WIFE JUST BECAUSE OF OUR

00:28:48.159 --> 00:28:50.428
CONGREGATION WADE WE DO THESE

00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:51.830

CHECK CAN YOU DOCUMENT FOR ME

00:28:54.032 --> 00:28:55.600
WHY THIS IS REQUIRED.

00:28:55.667 --> 00:28:57.202
THIS LED TO A TWO YEAR LONG

00:28:57.268 --> 00:28:58.636
HIATUS.

00:28:58.703 --> 00:29:00.105
AS A USER INTERNAL COUNSEL

00:29:00.171 --> 00:29:02.073
OUTSIDE COUNSEL CAME BACK AND

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.074
SAID WELL ACTUALLY WE'VE BEEN

00:29:03.141 --> 00:29:05.076
ASKING PEOPLE THAT FOR YEARS WE

00:29:05.143 --> 00:29:07.011
HAVE NO AUTHORITY.

00:29:07.078 --> 00:29:08.513
FOR SO THIS IDEA THAT WE ARE A

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.815
NATION OF LAWS A STATE OF LAWS

00:29:10.882 --> 00:29:11.983

IT'S WHAT'S BEHIND THIS BILL IT

00:29:14.919 --> 00:29:17.322
WOULD REQUIRE A ONE TIME GOING

00:29:17.388 --> 00:29:18.323
TO THOROUGHLY.

00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:19.290
IT WOULD INCLUDE A PUBLIC

00:29:19.357 --> 00:29:20.625
HEARING SO PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE

00:29:20.692 --> 00:29:23.728
CANDIDATES REGULATIONS AT THE

00:29:23.795 --> 00:29:24.529
THE QUESTION.

00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:25.864
THEY COULD SAY THAT IN A PUBLIC

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:28.333
HEARING AND TRY TO GET IT IN THE

00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:29.667
QUEUE FOR EXAMINATION.

00:29:29.734 --> 00:29:30.768
THE OTHER THING TO KNOW ABOUT

00:29:30.835 --> 00:29:32.003
THIS PARTICULAR BILL.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:35.373
IS THAT IN.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:35.907
TWENTY ELEVEN WHEN DARRYL

00:29:35.974 --> 00:29:37.442
STEINBERG WAS TO PRO TIM IN THE

00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:38.543

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.345
THE SENATE DEMOCRATS CONDUCTED

00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:42.147

00:29:42.213 --> 00:29:43.681
OF THAT YEAR.

00:29:43.748 --> 00:29:45.183
AND CAME AWAY AND THIS WAS OUR

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:46.818
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IN THE

00:29:46.885 --> 00:29:49.187
SENATE DEMOCRATS AND TWENTY

00:29:49.254 --> 00:29:50.021

SO -- ANYWAY THAT'S THE BACK

00:29:58.997 --> 00:30:02.167
DROP ON THIS THE IT WOULD

00:30:02.233 --> 00:30:04.402
REQUIRE AS I SAY THIS REVIEW TO

00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:05.737

WE WE HAVE SENIORS THAT NEED TO

00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:23.855
GET THE WORK FORCE THEY NEED

00:30:23.922 --> 00:30:25.190

00:36:39.997 --> 00:36:41.566
THEY HAVEN'T ACTUALLY LOOKED AT

00:36:41.632 --> 00:36:43.601
EVEN THE SIZE OF THE OIL AGENCY

00:36:43.668 --> 00:36:44.569

JUSTIFICATION FOR EXISTING RAGS

00:37:09.627 --> 00:37:10.928
ALREADY IN PLACE FURTHER IN A

00:37:10.995 --> 00:37:12.530
PUBLIC PURPOSE IT'S VERY

00:37:12.597 --> 00:37:16.601
SPECIFIC DUPLICATIVE OVERLAPPING.

00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:18.869
INCONSISTENT -- OUT OF DATE.

00:37:18.936 --> 00:37:19.971
SO YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING AT

00:37:20.037 --> 00:37:23.107
SOMETHING HAS CHANGED.

00:37:23.174 --> 00:37:24.642
IN THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE

00:37:24.709 --> 00:37:26.210
REGULATION OPERATES.

00:37:26.277 --> 00:37:28.279
THAT CAUSES A A QUESTION WHETHER

00:37:28.346 --> 00:37:30.147
THE WHETHER THIS RAG REMAINS

00:37:30.214 --> 00:37:32.083
CURRENT FOR THE PRESIDENT

00:37:32.149 --> 00:37:33.951
ENVIRONMENT.

00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:37.121
SO I A IT IS IT IS A FANTASY TO

00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:39.690
SUGGEST THAT AWAY AL IS DOING

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:40.625
THIS WORK.

00:37:40.691 --> 00:37:42.026
REALLY WHAT YOU HAVE STATE

00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:43.794
GOVERNMENT AND NOT JUST DATE OF

00:37:43.861 --> 00:37:45.296
CALIFORNIA IN A GOVERNMENTAL

00:37:45.363 --> 00:37:47.031
AGENCY.

00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:48.666
IS THE NEAREST THING YOU HAVE TO

00:37:48.733 --> 00:37:51.102
A PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINE.

00:37:51.168 --> 00:37:52.536
YOU PASSED THE LAW.

00:37:52.603 --> 00:37:54.038
THEIR DOCTOR RAG AND THEY'RE

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:55.640
GOING TO DO THAT.

00:37:55.706 --> 00:37:56.741
UNTIL THE LEGISLATURE KINDA RE

00:37:56.807 --> 00:37:57.975
EXAMINE SINGS OR PROP TO RE

00:37:58.042 --> 00:37:59.844
EXAMINATION WHICH IS OUR

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:03.080
FUNCTION -- IT IS OF COURSE YOU

00:38:03.147 --> 00:38:04.248
KNOW THE MODEL WITH OUR CHAMBERS

00:38:04.315 --> 00:38:05.816
IN.

00:38:05.883 --> 00:38:07.084
GOLD LEAF IN THE CHAMBERS IS DO

00:38:07.151 --> 00:38:09.453
THE LEGISLATURE. TO PASS JUST

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.421
LOS.

00:38:10.488 --> 00:38:11.555
IN THE SENATE CHECK THE LIBERTY

00:38:11.622 --> 00:38:13.157
OF ITS CITIZENS.

00:38:13.224 --> 00:38:14.692
THIS IS ACTUALLY A JUST LAW

00:38:14.759 --> 00:38:16.827
LIBERTY THE SERVICE AND THE LAWS

00:38:16.894 --> 00:38:18.596
BUT FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSE.

00:38:18.663 --> 00:38:21.766
AND NOT UNDULY RESTRAINING LIFE --

00:38:21.832 --> 00:38:23.801
SO I THINK.

00:38:23.868 --> 00:38:27.938
IT IS A ONE TIME MATTER.

00:38:28.005 --> 00:38:29.940
AND HONESTLY I THINK.

00:38:30.007 --> 00:38:31.709
WE OUGHT TO HAVE.

00:38:31.776 --> 00:38:33.044

LAWMAKERS. FOR A WELL FOUNDED

00:38:35.613 --> 00:38:37.081
STATE GOVERNMENT.

00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:39.150
THAT WARRANTS THE EX THE EX

00:38:39.216 --> 00:38:40.484
RESPECT THAT WE BELIEVE WE

00:38:40.551 --> 00:38:41.585
SHOULD HAVE.

00:38:41.652 --> 00:38:42.853
AND I THINK THAT'S OUR JOB IS

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.089
LAWMAKERS IT'S OUR FUNCTION THE

00:38:45.156 --> 00:38:47.124

ENGAGE IN OVERSIGHT -- SO THAT I

00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:52.663
I I'VE HEARD THE ARGUMENT BUT IT

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:55.633
DOES NOT REQUIRE A NEW RATIONALE

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.435
FOR THE THIRTEEN THOUSAND PAGES

00:38:57.501 --> 00:38:59.603
OF REGULATIONS WHICH PRESENTLY

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:02.039
EXISTING CALIFORNIA [inaudible]

00:39:02.106 --> 00:39:07.611
I IT'S QUITE -- FOR YOU ANSWER

00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:09.213
PART OF THE QUESTION BY MISTER

BIDDING IS QUESTION BUT ON THE

00:39:12.383 --> 00:39:15.486
NEW REGULATIONS THAT ARE FORMED

00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:19.356
WITH -- AWAY EL DO YOU KNOW THAT.

00:39:19.423 --> 00:39:20.991
IF THEY ARE MONITORING IF THE

00:39:21.058 --> 00:39:22.259

THEY ACTUALLY MONITORING DO THEY

00:39:35.406 --> 00:39:37.074
GET IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE I KNOW

00:39:37.141 --> 00:39:38.976
THAT WAS ONE OF THE DISCUSSIONS

00:39:39.043 --> 00:39:40.578
WE HAD HERE LAST YEAR ON

00:39:40.644 --> 00:39:41.879
ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:39:41.946 --> 00:39:44.949
IS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THE LAW

00:39:45.015 --> 00:39:47.118

00:39:47.184 --> 00:39:49.820
YOU KNOW THE THE OIL LAW WAS

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:52.690

BASED.

00:39:58.195 --> 00:39:59.797
IT'S AN EXAMINATION OF IS THE

00:39:59.864 --> 00:40:00.731
PROPOSED REGULATION FOUNDED UPON

00:40:00.798 --> 00:40:02.299
THE AUTHORIZES STATUTES THEY

00:40:02.366 --> 00:40:03.601
HAVE THE SEVEN LEGAL CRITERIA

00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:04.735
THEY APPLY TO EVALUATE

00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:06.270
REGULATIONS.

00:40:06.337 --> 00:40:07.304
BUT NO THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT

00:40:07.371 --> 00:40:08.539
THE ONGOING IMPLEMENTATION

00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:10.074
THAT'S NOT THEIR JOB.

00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:12.309
IT'S LIKE IS IT IS IT JUST FIVE

00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:13.644
WITHIN THE FOUR CORNERS A

00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:15.279
STATUTE IS A SUPPORTED.

00:40:15.346 --> 00:40:17.681

EFFECTIVELY DRAFTED DISAPPEAR

00:40:23.387 --> 00:40:24.488
THIS GOING TO WORK SO THERE IS

00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:27.291
CERTAINLY A ATTENTION TO ITS

00:40:27.358 --> 00:40:28.459
EFFECT IN THE REAL WORLD WOULD

00:40:28.526 --> 00:40:31.095

00:40:43.174 --> 00:40:44.074
OVERSIGHT.

00:40:44.141 --> 00:40:45.709
I WOULD SAY THAT'S ACTUALLY THE

00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:47.411
ONGOING WORK THE LEGISLATURE

00:40:47.478 --> 00:40:51.315
GAUGING OVERSIGHT.

00:40:51.382 --> 00:40:52.817
WHAT STRUCK TO EVERY AGENCY?

00:40:52.883 --> 00:40:55.252
OF THAT -- YOU KNOW WE WE SEE IT

00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:56.854
HAPPEN IN OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE.

00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:59.256
I GIVE A CREDIT TO MISTER TING

00:40:59.323 --> 00:40:59.890

00:40:59.957 --> 00:41:00.958
HOUSE.

00:41:01.025 --> 00:41:02.626
BUDGET COMMITTEE DOES THIS WORK

00:41:02.693 --> 00:41:04.795
THIS COMMITTEE OF COURSE PLAYS A

00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:06.030
VERY KEY ROLE OVERSIGHT.

00:41:06.096 --> 00:41:07.364
SOMEWHAT UNIQUE TO THE OTHER

00:41:07.431 --> 00:41:08.933
STANDING COMMITTEES BECAUSE THE

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:10.167
TASK OF THIS.

00:41:10.234 --> 00:41:13.037
BOARD AND EACH SUBJECT MATTER.

00:41:13.103 --> 00:41:14.305
THE WHOLE PREMISE OF OVERSIGHT

00:41:14.371 --> 00:41:16.106
IS THAT WE HAVE OUR THIRTY ONE

00:41:16.173 --> 00:41:17.842
STANDING COMMITTEES.

00:41:17.908 --> 00:41:19.143
ALL OF WHOM.

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:21.011
WE HAVE WE ARE DEVELOPING

00:41:21.078 --> 00:41:22.379
SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT STAFF

00:41:22.446 --> 00:41:24.849
SUBJECT BY SUBJECT BY SUBJECT.

00:41:24.915 --> 00:41:26.617
AND THAT'S STAFF IS TASKED WITH

00:41:26.684 --> 00:41:27.952
REVIEWING NEW BILLS.

00:41:28.018 --> 00:41:30.454
BUT ALSO KEEPING AN EYE ON HOW

00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:30.921
EXIST TO DOLLARS BEING

00:41:30.988 --> 00:41:31.989
IMPLEMENTED.

00:41:32.056 --> 00:41:33.324
SORT OF A COMES THEIR ATTENTION

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:34.992
THAT MAY BE THE LEAD TO TRY TO

00:41:35.059 --> 00:41:38.362
TAKE A PEEK AT SOMETHING -- THEY

00:41:38.429 --> 00:41:39.730
CAN DO THAT SO I'D SAY THE

00:41:39.797 --> 00:41:41.232
ONGOING FUNCTION OVERSIGHT.

00:41:41.298 --> 00:41:43.133
IS REALLY.

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.369
IN THE LEGISLATURE -- SO THIS

00:41:45.436 --> 00:41:47.171
BILL ACTUALLY IS NOT DESIGNED TO

00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:49.106
YES SIR TO GET INTO THAT.

00:41:49.173 --> 00:41:52.176
IT'S MORE A SNAPSHOT IN TIME.

00:41:52.243 --> 00:41:54.044
LOOKING AT PRUNING [inaudible]

00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:56.580
IF APPROPRIATE.

00:41:56.647 --> 00:41:58.249
PAUL JUST FOLLOW UP WHICH I DO

00:41:58.315 --> 00:42:00.084
APPRECIATE THE BILL I UNDERSTAND

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:01.018
THE CONCERNS.

00:42:01.085 --> 00:42:04.088
BUT AS WAS NOTED.

00:42:04.154 --> 00:42:05.556
YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MANY THINGS

00:42:05.623 --> 00:42:07.391
THAT HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME SO

00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:11.328
IF WE JUST USE TECHNOLOGY AS ONE

00:42:11.395 --> 00:42:12.596
ON ON OUR BOOKS.

00:42:12.663 --> 00:42:14.832
WHEN WE LOOK AT A DECADE TWO

00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:16.300
DECADES AGO?

00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:18.369
THERE THERE'S MANY THINGS THAT

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:19.837
WE WERE DOING THEN THAT WERE

00:42:19.904 --> 00:42:21.805
PROBABLY NOT EVEN LOOKINGAT NOW

00:42:21.872 --> 00:42:23.841
ALSO CLEANING UP AS YOU MIGHT

00:42:23.908 --> 00:42:25.776
SAY AS A METAPHOR.

00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:27.544
I THINK -- DEFINITELY IS

00:42:27.611 --> 00:42:29.546
SOMETHING THAT WE ONLY DID DO

00:42:29.613 --> 00:42:32.883
AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL.

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:34.518
THANK YOU.

00:42:34.585 --> 00:42:35.653
THANK YOU AND DIVE MISTER

00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:36.587
PATTERSON.

00:42:36.654 --> 00:42:38.522
I'M SCHOOL THANK YOU FOR

00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:39.990
BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD -- OF

00:42:40.057 --> 00:42:41.592
I'M GONNA SUPPORT IT TODAY --

00:42:41.659 --> 00:42:43.794
BUT JUST A LITTLE INDICATION OF

00:42:43.861 --> 00:42:46.897
HOW DEEP AND WIDE -- THAT THE

00:42:46.964 --> 00:42:48.966
PROBLEM REALLY IS -- THERE'S AN

00:42:49.033 --> 00:42:50.267
AREA THAT I'VE BEEN PARTICULARLY

00:42:50.334 --> 00:42:51.702
INTERESTED IN WHICH IS TITLED

00:42:51.769 --> 00:42:52.803
TWENTY TWO AND HEALTH CODE

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:54.972
IN NINETEEN SIXTY SOMETHING IT

00:42:55.039 --> 00:42:56.640
WAS PASSED NINETEEN SEVENTY IT

00:42:56.707 --> 00:42:58.409
WAS LAST MODERNIZED.

00:42:58.475 --> 00:42:59.743
AND IF YOU TALK TO HOSPITALS

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:01.211
CLINICS DOCTORS IT'S AFTER.

00:43:01.278 --> 00:43:03.047
THEY WILL TELL YOU THE TITLE

00:43:03.113 --> 00:43:04.848
TWENTY TWO IS SO OUTDATED.

00:43:04.915 --> 00:43:05.616
AND IF YOU TALK TO THE

00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:08.352
ADMINISTRATION OF TITLE.

00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:10.087
TWENTY TWO TODAY THEY WILL SAY

00:43:10.154 --> 00:43:11.689
IT IS IN FACT OUT DATED TO WHAT

00:43:11.755 --> 00:43:13.123
DEGREE.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:14.925
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE

00:43:14.992 --> 00:43:17.561
REGULATIONS REQUIRE AN ACTION.

00:43:17.628 --> 00:43:19.330
THAT IS SO OUTDATED THAT THE

00:43:19.396 --> 00:43:20.764
ONLY THING THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:43:20.831 --> 00:43:23.701
CAN DO AND THE ONLY THING THAT

00:43:23.767 --> 00:43:26.003
THE HOSPITAL OR IS TO SAY.

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:27.438
WE REQUEST A WAIVER.

00:43:27.504 --> 00:43:28.939
GO CHECK HOW MANY WAIVERS ARE

00:43:29.006 --> 00:43:31.709
GIVEN OVER AND OVER AND OVER

00:43:31.775 --> 00:43:32.476
AGAIN.

00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:34.044
SO THAT THE THE REGULATION IS

00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:37.047
ESSENTIALLY SO OUTDATED AS TO BE

00:43:37.114 --> 00:43:38.615
IRRELEVANT TO THE PRESENT.

00:43:38.682 --> 00:43:41.685
TIME -- AND SO I THINK THAT IF

00:43:41.752 --> 00:43:42.953
WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.155
DUPLICATIVE IF WE CAN TAKE A

00:43:45.222 --> 00:43:48.058
LOOK AT REGULATIONS -- THAT BORE

00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:49.927
WANT MAYBE ONCE SERVED A PURPOSE

00:43:49.994 --> 00:43:51.562
BUT SIMPLY.

00:43:51.628 --> 00:43:54.131
ARE SO OUTDATED -- SO I I

00:43:54.198 --> 00:43:56.233
APPRECIATE THE WORK AS AS FAR AS

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:57.267
IT DOES GO BUT I DO THINK WE

00:43:57.334 --> 00:43:58.569
THIS THIS COMMITTEE OUGHT TO BE

00:43:58.635 --> 00:44:00.404
LOOKING AT SO MANY OF THE

00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:01.638
REGULATIONS THAT ARE SO OUTDATED

00:44:01.705 --> 00:44:03.073
THAT THEY CONTINUE TO GET WAVE

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.975
AFTER WAVE AFTER WAVE.

00:44:05.042 --> 00:44:06.610
FOR WHICH BASICALLY SAYS PRIME

00:44:06.677 --> 00:44:07.911
APHASIA THAT THE REGULATION IS

00:44:07.978 --> 00:44:10.047
SO OUTDATED IT TO BE MEANINGLESS

00:44:10.114 --> 00:44:11.615
AND YET THE HOSPITALS HAVE TO GO

00:44:11.682 --> 00:44:12.750
THROUGH.

00:44:12.816 --> 00:44:14.351
ASKING FOR THE WAIVER.

00:44:14.418 --> 00:44:16.687
UP THE SPENDING STAFF TIME ON IT

00:44:16.754 --> 00:44:17.988
OFTENTIMES HAVING TO HAVE

00:44:18.055 --> 00:44:19.623
PROFESSIONALS RIGHT THE WAIVER

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:20.591
LANGUAGE.

00:44:20.657 --> 00:44:21.925
AND THE WAIVERS AUTOMATICALLY

00:44:21.992 --> 00:44:24.161
GIVEN YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR

00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:25.896
AFTER YEAR SO I PLEDGE FOR THE

00:44:25.963 --> 00:44:26.830
EFFORT I THINK AND I THINK THIS

00:44:26.897 --> 00:44:27.698
IS.

00:44:27.765 --> 00:44:29.466
THE THE VALUABLE ROLE OF OF THE

00:44:29.533 --> 00:44:32.870
ACCOUNTABILITY COMMITTEE SO I

00:44:32.936 --> 00:44:33.470

MISTER CLAY WITH YOUR ASSESSMENT

00:44:46.116 --> 00:44:46.717
THAT IT'S JUST THE KIND OF THING

THAT.

00:44:47.951 --> 00:44:49.453

00:44:54.758 --> 00:44:56.460
I THINK IT'S HARD TO ARGUE

00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:58.028
AGAINST JUST WHAT SEEMS TO BE

00:44:58.095 --> 00:44:59.363

TAPE ADDING.

00:45:09.073 --> 00:45:12.109
UNNECESSARY LAYERS OF CONFUSION --

00:45:12.176 --> 00:45:14.078

AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES.

00:58:02.045 --> 00:58:03.479
AND SO THIS PAST FOLLOWS IN

00:58:03.546 --> 00:58:05.081
SUMATRAN BORNEO FILMING AND I

00:58:05.148 --> 00:58:06.683
SAW SOME OF THE MOST HORRIFIC

00:58:06.749 --> 00:58:08.151
THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE --

00:58:08.218 --> 00:58:11.187
DEFORESTED LAND -- FOR HUNDREDS

00:58:11.254 --> 00:58:12.789
OF THOUSANDS OF MILES --

00:58:12.856 --> 00:58:15.024
ILLEGALLY DEFORESTED ACTUALLY --

00:58:15.091 --> 00:58:16.593
BURNED TO THE GROUND -- WE

00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:18.228
RESCUED ENTERING A TANK THAT WAS

00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:19.929
FOUR MONTHS PREGNANT FROM A PALM

00:58:19.996 --> 00:58:21.464
OIL PLANTATION ACTUALLY

00:58:21.531 --> 00:58:22.799
SURROUNDED.

00:58:22.866 --> 00:58:24.500
BY OTHER PALMA PLANTATIONS AND

00:58:24.567 --> 00:58:27.370
DIED SHE WAS SHOT -- MOST DURING

00:58:27.437 --> 00:58:29.172
IT HANGS ARE SHOT TO SHOT WITH A

00:58:29.239 --> 00:58:30.907
TWENTY TWO BILLION IN OUR SIDE --

00:58:30.974 --> 00:58:32.542
ABOUT 90% OF RAINY TANKS ARE

00:58:32.609 --> 00:58:34.043
SHOT -- BECAUSE THEY ARE

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:35.111
CONSIDERED PASSED BY THE PALM

00:58:35.178 --> 00:58:36.613
OIL INDUSTRY AND OTHER

00:58:36.679 --> 00:58:38.748
INDUSTRIES AS WELL -- IT TOOK AN

00:58:38.815 --> 00:58:41.050
HOUR TO SEDATE HER -- WE

00:58:41.117 --> 00:58:43.353
EVENTUALLY WERE ABLE -- TO YOU

00:58:43.419 --> 00:58:44.387
KNOW CATCHER IN AND THAT'S AND

00:58:44.454 --> 00:58:45.455
WE FOUND OUT SHE WAS PREGNANT AT

00:58:45.521 --> 00:58:47.323
THAT TIME IT WAS TOGETHER WITH

00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:48.825
HEARING TING INFORMATION CENTER.

00:58:48.892 --> 00:58:51.761
AND I THINK THAT IF MOST PEOPLE

00:58:51.828 --> 00:58:52.328
SAW THIS FOOTAGE AND REALIZE

00:58:52.395 --> 00:58:54.764
THAT. FOR THE 500-002-60000

00:58:54.831 --> 00:58:56.266
RINGGIT HANGS ARE THE ONLY ONES

00:58:56.332 --> 00:58:58.167
REMAINING IN THE WILD -- OF

00:58:58.234 --> 00:58:59.702
WHICH MOST OF THEM ARE REMAIN IN

00:58:59.769 --> 00:59:02.171
SUMATRA AND BORNEO AND VERY FEW

00:59:02.238 --> 00:59:03.773
AND IN JAVA ON THE ISLAND OF

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.909
JAVA -- BUT I THINK THE MOST

00:59:05.975 --> 00:59:08.611
IMPORTANT THING -- HERE IS THAT --

00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:11.447
THERE'S THERE'S A DEMAND AND THE

00:59:11.514 --> 00:59:14.183
DEMAND WE DON'T KNOW -- IS --

00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:15.385
THE RIGHT DEMAND SEWED DO WE

00:59:15.451 --> 00:59:16.753
REALLY PUT A PRICE ON THE

00:59:16.819 --> 00:59:17.720
EXTINCTION OF THE SPEECH IS NOT

00:59:17.787 --> 00:59:19.455
ONLY THE SPECIES BUT THERE'S

00:59:19.522 --> 00:59:20.990
ONLY FIVE HUNDRED SUMATRAN

00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:22.558
TIGERS LEFT IN THE WILD.

00:59:22.625 --> 00:59:24.994
YOU CAN WE WERE WE SPENT ABOUT

00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:26.062
TWO WEEKS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

00:59:26.129 --> 00:59:27.964
RAINFOREST WE COULDN'T SEE

00:59:28.031 --> 00:59:29.332
WITHIN SEE -- ONE THEY'RE SO

00:59:29.399 --> 00:59:31.968
RARE NOT ONLY THAT -- THE THE

00:59:32.035 --> 00:59:32.835
JOB AND RIGHT NOW.

00:59:32.902 --> 00:59:34.771
WE THINK THERE'S ONLY TWO

00:59:34.837 --> 00:59:35.672
HUNDRED FIFTY REMAINING AND IT'S

00:59:35.738 --> 00:59:43.780
DUE TO DEFORESTATION AND AND

00:59:43.846 --> 00:59:45.515
LACK OF HABITAT AND THE

00:59:45.581 --> 00:59:46.349
CORRIDORS -- CONNECTING THEM ARE

00:59:46.416 --> 00:59:47.917
THE ONLY THING LEFT TO BE ABLE

00:59:47.984 --> 00:59:49.085
TO DIVERSIFY -- THEIR DNA -- TO

00:59:49.152 --> 00:59:49.585
SAVE THEIR SPECIES FROM

00:59:49.652 --> 00:59:50.353
EXTINCTION SO WE'RE TALKING

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:51.788
POSSIBLY -- THE NEXT TEN YEARS

00:59:51.854 --> 00:59:52.755
