ARE PLAN TODAY IS TO HAVE OUR SECOND PANEL BEGIN PROMPTLY AT ELEVEN AM. FOR MEMBERS. WE WANT TO BE THROUGH OUR PANEL AND ARE QUESTIONING ON THE FIRST PANEL- BY ELEVEN SO THAT WE CAN START PROMPTLY AT ELEVEN WITH THE SECOND PANEL. IN ORDER FOR IT TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE TIME FOR Q. AND A FOR THE FIRST PANEL. I'M GOING TO ASK THAT WE ARE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF- VERY BRIEF REMARKS BY. PICTURE FRIEDMAN AND MYSELF ASSET WE SKIP OPENING REMARKS AND BEGIN WITH OUR PRESENTATION BY THE PANELISTS. OUR FIRST PANEL. ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY'S DRAFT TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN A FUNDING PLAN INCLUDES BRIAN KELLY THE CHIEF EXECUTVE OFFICER OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY AND BRIAN ANNIS THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. LOUIS THOMPSON THE CHAIR OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL PEER REVIEW GROUP AND HELEN CARE CENTER. PRINCIPLE FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST WITH THE FELLOW. A LITTLE HISTORY ABOUT HIGH SPEED RAIL SUB THREE HAS BEEN AN INTEGRAL PART OF HIGH SPEED RAILS JOURNEY THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE PREDECESSOR ASSEMBLY RICH GARDEN HEARD HIGH SPEED RAIL PROPOSALS BEFORE IT WENT TO THE BALLOT THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. HIGH SPEED RAIL pHISTORICALLY GONE THROUGH SUB THREE INCLUDING THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR CAP AND TRADE THE REALITY IS THESE DECISIONS ON HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN FOR A LONG LONG TIME MY NOTES HERE SAY LONG AFTER I'M GONE AND- YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT I'LL BE. DEAD BUT- IT IS GONNA TAKE A LONG TIME FOR THIS PROJECT TO BE BUILT. WE'RE HERE TODAY TO HELP GUIDE OUR DECISIONS THAT WILL SHAPE HOW CALIFORNIA MOVES INTO THE FUTURE. AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE CHAIR FRIEDMAN IF SHE HAS THE REMARKS SHOULD LIKE TO MAKE. THANK YOU TERRIBLE- JUST A VERY VERY BRIEFLY- I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO- THIS. THIS HEARING THIS MORNING TO UNDERSTAND THE STATE OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT AND ABOUT THE BEST PATH FORWARD. TO BE PERFECTLY TRANSPARENT I AM A HUGE HIGH SPEED RAIL SUPPORTER- AND MY GOAL IS TO. MAKE SURE THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL IS BILLS NOT JUST THE SECTION BUT THE ENTIRE. SYSTEM AS SUPPORTED BY THE VOTERS AND AS ENVISIONED WITH THAT DREAM OF CONNECTING OUR MAJOR POPULATION CENTERS. I ALSO BELIEVE THOUGH THAT WE WILL BE DOING A HUGE DISSERVICE TO THIS PROJECT AND WE WOULD NOT BE DOING OUR JOBS AS ELECTED OFFICIALS IF WE DIDN'T ASK TOUGH QUESTIONS. IF WE DIDN'T EVALUATE ALL PASSED FORWARD- THAT WE COULD TAKE IF WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE DECISION POINTS AND THE TIMING OF THOSE DECISION POINTS. SO THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE ASKED TODAY I FROM MY PERSPECTIVE FOR ME OR NOT AN ATTACK ON THE PROJECT BUT RATHER INTENDED TO MAKE THE PROJECT BETTER- AND MORE TRANSPARENT. WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT BACK TO YOUR BOTTOM THANK YOU AND- A BLISTER FONG HAS- JOINED US AND I'D LIKE TO ASK A FEW OF THE BRIEF COMMENTS THAT HE LEADS. I THANK YOU CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN- RIGHT AT THE GATE I JUST WANT TO PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE FOR THIS COMMITTEE. THE ENORMITY OF THE PROJECT. WE'RE HERE DISCUSSING AND CERTAINLY HAS AS CHAIR OF THEM INDICATED WE'VE WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE REVIEWING- BUSINESS PLAN AT THE BUSINESS PLAN. BUT THE PROPOSED BUSINESS PLAN FOR THIS PROJECT. IS PROJECTED TO BE ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. ME JUST SAY THAT AGAIN A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. IN JUST THIS YEAR ALONE. THE PROJECT IS BUDGETED TO COST TAXPAYERS MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS PER DAY. WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE ANOTHER BUSINESS PLAN OUTLINING MORE DELAYS OR COST OVERRUNS. FOR ISSUES THE MISMANAGEMENT AND MORE EXCUSES AND I APPRECIATE THE- CARE FREEDMAN ARE TO CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT WE NEED MORE ACCOUNTABILITY- IN THIS PROJECT FOR SURE. IN ANY EVENT OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. HAS REPEATEDLY ISSUED THE SAME CONCERNS WITH EACH REVIEW. THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY IS DOING THE SAME THING AND EXPECTING A DIFFERENT RESULT. AND WHEN WE ARE DIGGING OURSELVES INTO A HOLE. WE NEED TO FIRST START DIGGING. I BRING THIS UP SO THAT THERE IS OPENNESS AND HOW WE ARE LOOKING AT THE CURRENT BUSINESS PLAN FOR MERCED THE BIGGEST FILLED. WELL AND FOR THIS PROJECT AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR HAS NOT BEEN PROMISING. WE'VE ALREADY SPENT TEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER BUDGET FOR THE INCOMPLETE MADERA SHAFTER SEGMENT. THAT'S A HUNDRED AND 68% ABOVE. THE ORIGINAL PRICE TAG. WHERE FOR YEARS PAST THE DATE OF COMPLETION AND THE MADERA SHAFTER SEGMENT. IS LESS THAN ANALYSIS FOUND CORROSION AND THEY COLLECT READING A QUOTE. A HORRIBLE SEQUENCE OF MISTAKES AND QUOTE IN THE INTERNAL TRACKS DOCTOR. AND THE AUTHORITY SIMPLY FAIL TO DELIVER TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT PARCEL LAND PURCHASE PURCHASE. NEEDED FOR ONGOING CONSTRUCTION. WE CANNOT IGNORE REALITY. I AM REMINDED OF THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE BEST PREDICTOR OF FUTURE BEHAVIOR IS PAST BEHAVIOR. I DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN CONTINUE TO HOPE AND WISH THAT EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OKAY. IF SOMETHING DOES NOT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE. AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS PROJECT IS CLEARLY OFF THE RAILS I BELIEVE WE MUST TAKE A HARD LOOK. AND BE VERY HONEST WITH OURSELVES. AS THIS COMMITTEES AS WITH THESE COMMITTEES AND AS LESS AS THE LEGISLATURE. ABOUT THE BUSINESS PLAN IN THE FUTURE THIS PROJECT AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION TODAY. I THANK YOU. THANK YOU OF WILL BE AGAIN- WITH OUR PANEL NOW. BEGINNING WITH A BRIAN CALLEY. I UNDERSTAND THAT- MISTER KELLY MAY HAVE A- UNSTABLE CONNECTIONS. THANK MISTER CHAIRMAN IF YOU CAN HEAR ME I THINK WE'RE OKAY CAN YOU HEAR ME ALRIGHT YES WE CAN HEAR YOU JUST FINE WELCOME TO THE HEARING. RIGHT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM ALL MEMBERS I OF COURSE APPRECIATE IN A HONORED BY THE OPPORTUNITY. ADJUSTED FOR THE COMMITTEE TODAY AND PERCENT. ARE REVISED DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN FOR TWENTY TWENTY. IT'S A LITTLE ODD TO SAY THAT BECAUSE WE'RE IN NOW GETTING DEEPLY INTO TWENTY TWENTY ONE- BUT THE- EVENTS OF THE PAST YEAR OF A- PUSH THIS OUT BACK AND- AGAIN I'M- A BIT ANXIOUS TO GET HERE TALK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE WHERE WE'RE GOING. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO DO SO TODAY I HAVE A BRIEF. A POWER POINT. PRESENTATION THAT I WANT TO. GIVE UP SUMMARIZING THE BUSINESS PLAN WHERE WE ARE. I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THAT. AND MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANT TO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WITH ME ON THIS PANEL IS. OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER BRIAN ANNIS WHO MANY OF YOU KNOW. VERY WELL FROM HIS YEARS IN THE LEGISLATURE AT THE- TRANSPORTATION AGENCY- THAT'S- BRIAN IS JOINED ME. TODAY ON THIS BILL. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO JUMP INTO THE- PRESENTATION SUMMARY THE BUSINESS. GREAT I THE MISTER KELLY BEFORE YOU BEGIN- ONE OTHER THING I WANTED TO- ADD TO FOR THE BENEFIT OF MEMBERS IS WHEN WE GET TO Q. AND A- WE ARE GOING TO ALLOW. EACH OF YOU TO ASK A QUESTION AND THEY WERE GOING TO MOVE TO ANOTHER MEMBER AND WE'RE GONNA TRYING TO YOU KNOW DO ONE ROUND. AND THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ASK A SECOND QUESTION TIME PERMITTING SO- THAT'S THE WAY WILL PROCEED BUT- I WANT TO ASK YOU TO PLEASE WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO. YOU KNOW MAKE A LITTLE SPEECH BEFORE THE ACTUAL QUESTION- YOU KNOW. AT SOME COLOR- WE WERE TRYING TO AVOID THAT AND REALLY FOCUS IN ON THE QUESTIONS HERE- WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE ANTICIPATING A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WANT TO. ADD PUBLIC COMMENTS AT THE END SO WE WANT TO A LOT TIME FOR ASKING QUESTIONS AND FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND FOR THE PANELS IT'S A LOT TO DO IN THE TIME THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF TODAY. SO I ASK FOR YOUR COOPERATION MR CALLACE SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION. I KNOW NO PROBLEM MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU. OKAY THEN WITH MOVEMENTS LIKE- AGAIN I'M HERE TO PRESENT THE SUMMARY OF THE DRAFT THE REVISED DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN WE RELEASED THIS ON FEBRUARY NINTH WE ARE NOW IN A THIRTY DAY PUBLIC REVIEW PERIOD- ON THIS- REPORT THIS PLAN. THAT ENDS ON MARCH TWELFTH IN UNDER OUR AGREEMENT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP UP MY BOARD IS TO ADOPT THE FINAL A PLAN BY APRIL FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE I DO THINK THERE'S VALUE IN IT CAN OF COURSE SAYING TO THIS COMMITTEE AND LEGISLATORS THAT NOT WITHSTANDING. THE ACTION OF THE ADOPTION OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN IN APRIL WE CERTAINLY EXPECT A CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE BEYOND THAT BROKE CERTAINLY THROUGH THIS BUDGET CYCLE IS WE NOT ONLY A PERCENT OF THE BUSINESS PLAN BUT WE HAVE A COMPANY FUNDING PLAN AS WELL. TO ACCESS REMAINING BOND DOLLARS DEDICATED TO HIGH SPEED RAIL- AND THAT'S BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE I KNOW THAT'LL BE A PART OF THE BUDGET CONVERSATION WELL BEYOND THE ADOPTION OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN SO I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ANOTHER CONVERSATIONS WILL CERTAINLY GO BEYOND APRIL FIFTEENTH FOR ACTIONS THIS YEAR BUT THAT IS THE SCHEDULE. WE HAVE FOR THE WORK OF MY POOR. LOOKS LIKE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE BUSINESS COVERS THAT THAT WE REALLY HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT MUCH PUBLICLY IS THE IMPACT OF CARBON NINETEEN ON THIS PROJECT OF COURSE IT'S IMPACTED ALL PARTS OF OUR SOCIETY AND THE MANY PUBLIC TRANSIT OPERATORS AROUND THE STATE THAT AROUND THE COUNTRY BUT- IMPACTED DRAMATICALLY. WHILE WE ARE NOT AN OPERATING SERVICE YET CERTAINLY THEIR IMPACTS ON OUR WORK RECORD TEAM OF MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FORTY FOUR EMPLOYEES BUT AT THIS POINT- DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY- AUCTIONS FOR CAP AND TRADE UP THE INITIAL AUCTION- THAT OCCUR RIGHT AFTER THE PANDEMIC HIT- COST US DEARLY AND IN TWENTY TWENTY WE LOST ABOUT. GET CHECK CAME IN WITH JUST ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION LAST HUNDRED EIGHT MILLION LESSON CAP AND TRADE REVENUE FOR THIS PROJECT THAT IS MORE OF A CASH FLOW ISSUE THE WAY THE AUCTIONS WORK WE EXPECT THESE ALLOWANCES WILL BE SOLD FUTURE AUCTIONS. BUT THERE IS A CASH FLOW HERE. OKAY INTERMEDIATE MILLION A IN TRADE. WE HAVE BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE IN MOVING FORWARD OUR ENVIRONMENTAL SCHEDULES AT THIS POINT I'M LAST COUPLE OF LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR- TWO YEARS OR SO AND WE HAVE. A DELAYED SOME OF THAT WORK- YOU TO THE CARPET NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN ORDER. TO PROVIDE COMMUNITIES AND STAKEHOLDERS WITH ADDITIONAL TIME. TO COMMENT ON OUR WORK. I TAKE MORE TIME TO RESPOND TO THOSE COMMENTS- AND ALSO REQUIRES US TO SORT OF. RE SEQUENCE WHEN THE FEDERAL. PARTNERS REVIEW OUR PARK WORK SO THERE'S BEEN SOME IMPACTS TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL SCHEDULES AS WELL. OUR TRACKING SYSTEMS PROCUREMENT WHICH IS UP. OF PROCUREMENT THAT WE STARTED LAST YEAR TWENTY TWENTY AND WERE ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED TO CONCLUDE A TWENTY TWENTY WITHOUT. PUSH BACK INTO THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I THINK THERE'S SOME BENEFITS OF DOING THAT AND THEY WILL JUST HAVE MORE CONSULTATION COMMUNICATION WITH YOU ALL ABOUT THE RIGHT APPROACH ON THE TRACKING SYSTEMS. BUT IT AND IT'S AN IMPACT TO THE PROGRAM STEMMING LARGELY FROM THE COCA NINETEEN CORRECT. AND LASTLY. BECAUSE COURTHOUSES HAD- DELAYED OR SOMETIMES CANCELLED THE YOU KNOW WORK DAYS. DURING FULL SHUTDOWNS UP SOME OF THE PROCESSES IN FILINGS THAT WE DO FOR ACQUISITIONS. ENDED UP TAKING UP MORE TIMES AND THOSE ARE TWO OR THREE DAY ITEMS THAT SOMETIMES. TOOK SIX OR EIGHT WEEKS AND WE HAD SOME IMPACTS ACROSS THE BOARD AN ENTERPRISE. WIDE PLEASE COPE. NEXT ONE. ALL WERE VERY CLEAR IN DRAFT ABOUT KIND OF WHERE WE SHOULD WHERE WE ARE AND HOW WE ARE COMPENSATING YOU DEALING WITH SOME OF THESE IMPACTS BUT WE DO SAY IN THIS DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN THIS REVISED PLAN THAT OUR SCHEDULES FOR COMPLETING OUR C. P. R. CONSTRUCTION PACKAGES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ONE TWO THREE ARE PUSHED BACK TO DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE FOR- WILL BE CONCLUDED IN ABOUT THIRTEEN MONTHS AT LEAST UP ACHIEVING SUBSTANTIAL. COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE FOR- BY APRIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND AS I SAID EARLIER WE PUSHED BACK ON TRACK INSISTS CONTRACT AWARD NOW TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT PICTURE ON THE RIGHT THERE IS WHERE WE STAND ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL UP FOR. THREE YEARS NOW WELL JACK AFTER. NINETY NINE MILES- OF THE ELECTRIFIED SPEED. FACE ONCE IN CENTRAL LARGE. COVERING NUMBER SAID MAKERS FEEL A STRETCH IN TWENTY ONE. WE WILL- ENVIRONMENTALLY WILLIE'S BRING TO OUR BOARD. OF THE CERTIFICATIONS OF THE RODS THE RECORDS OF DECISIONS. TAKE CLEAR ABOUT AN ADDITIONAL NINETY NINETY TWO MILES- THE NEXT ONE IS THE BAKERSFIELD PALMDALE STRETCHES IN. ORDER TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT SCREEN. AND THE BURBANK LA STRETCH WHICH IS UP A LITTLE BIT FURTHER SOUTH- AT THE END OF TWENTY ONE WHAT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILES CLEARED- AND THEN- THE LAST THE- LAST. COUPLE HUNDRED WILL BE DONE- IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHEN WE FINISH THE EXTENSIONS OR CERTIFY THE DOCUMENTS IN THE BAY AREA. AND THE REMAINDER. OF THE DOCUMENTS DOWN SO TELL. NEXT SLIDE. WELL WE DO ALSO- INDICATING THIS REVISED PLAN THAT- JIM PAXSON RECONSTRUCTION FOR SCHEDULES AND COSTS- WHENEVER WE HAVE A SCHEDULE PUSH BACK THIS USUALLY ASSOCIATED COST IMPACT OUR CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE UP. AS WHAT WE CALL KNOWN BECAUSE WHICH WE IDENTIFY AS KNOWN- OF CALLS THAT ARE BEFORE US IN AND ACOSTA WE SEE IN FRONT OF US TO COMPLETE THE WORK- THAT THREE THIRTY ABOUT FIVE WHICH THAT EXCEEDS OUR TESTING- ADOPTED BUDGET BUYER REPORTED DOES NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE HAVE TO THE PROGRAM BUT IT DOES EXCEED OUR OPERATING BUDGET AT THIS POINT SO WE WOULD. PROPOSE A COMPACT FOR BOARD TO ADJUSTED OPERATING BUDGET SO IN ADDITION TO THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE UP THREE TO THIRTY MILLION- IN LIGHT OF ALL THE RISKS WERE SAYING AND THE FACT THAT SOME OF THOSE COSTS IN THE FUTURE MIGHT MOVE WE ARE LOOKING AT ADDING A SIZEABLE CONTINGENCY FOR RESCUE ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS SO WE MOVE OUR CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT BUDGET FROM TWELVE POINT FOR UP TO ABOUT THIRTEEN POINT EIGHT. BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S WHAT'S REFLECTED HERE THAT COVERS BOTH KNOWN COSTS WILL RECALL MY CONTINGENCY. FOR REX NEXT WHAT. BOB THIS GETS BACK TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL. THIS REFER THE THINGS THESE OF THE- REMAINING. OF OR WHICH WE MUST BE ARE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK- A PART OF THE PHASE ONE SYSTEM BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES. AND ANAHEIM AS I SAID EARLIER. WE HAVE CLEARED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILES A HUNDRED NINETY NINE MILES. OF THAT FIVE HUNDRED SEGMENT. IN TWENTY TWENTY YOU CAN SEE IN THAT SECOND COLUMN WE PUT OUT. FOR DRAFT DOCUMENTS FOR THE BAKERSFIELD PALMDALE STRETCH. BURBANK'S LA ASSEMBLY. AND SAN FRANCISCO TO SAN JOSE. WE'VE GONE THROUGH THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIODON THOSE WE ARE NOW PREPARING RESPONSES TO THOSE COMMENTS. AND WE ARE PROJECTING THE DATE- WILL BRING THIS BACK TO OUR BOARD TO CERTIFY. THE RECORDS OF DECISIONS ARE THE FIRST TO AND THIS YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THE REMAINDER IN TWENTY TWENTY TO OUR DRAFT DOCUMENTS WILL BE OUT LATER THIS YEAR- FOR BOTH THE PALMDALE TO BURBANK STRETCH THE LA. TO ANNA. NEXTPART. ONE LAST FEBRUARY AND EVEN BEFORE OUR PROJECT UPDATE REPORT IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE INDICATED AFTER SOME WORK DONE BY- DEUTSCHE BAHN WHICH IS A REALLY TRAIN OPERATOR THAT WE BROUGHT IN BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAVE THEM LOOK AT OPTIONS TO GET AN EARLY OPPORTUNITY SEGMENT GOING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE ASK THEM TO DO SOME WORK ON THAT AND THEN ADVISES TO. HOW WE CAN PUT INTO PLACE WITH THE BENEFITS WOULD BE OF DOING THAT AND SO WE INDICATED IN OUR PROJECT UPDATE REPORT THANK YOU TWENTY NINETEEN AND AGAIN IN OUR SPRING- FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY DRAFT TWENTY AT THAT WE WERE INTERESTED IN GETTING A HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILE IN ROOM SERVICE SEGMENT GOING BEYOND JUST THE ORIGINAL HUNDRED NINETY MILES AWAY NOW IN CONSTRUCTION. THE REASON WE'RE FOR THAT IS ACCORDING TO THE ETF ANALYSIS AND WORK HOW WE CAN REDUCE TRAVEL TIMES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BY BETWEEN NINETY MINUTES A HUNDRED-MINUTES OBVERSES A NO BUILD OPTION WHICH JUST LEAVE THE SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE AS WE KNOW IT TODAY IN THE VALLEY IT DOES PROVIDE VALUABLE STATE ASSET THAT MORE THAN DOUBLES THE SERVICE THROUGH THAT CENTRAL VALLEY MERCED THE BAKERSFIELD STRETCH FROM SEVEN DAILY TRIPS TO EIGHTEEN. BECAUSE IT CONNECTS THREE OF THE FASTEST GROWING CITIES IN THE STATE MERCED BAKERSFIELD AND FRESNO AND PRODUCES THE GREATEST RIDERSHIP INCREASE DROPBOX'S REVENUE FOR THE SMALLEST INVESTMENT COMPARED TO SIMILAR INVESTMENTS ON OTHER QUARTERS OTHER QUARTERS ALSO PROVIDES INTERNET CONNECTION THE PARTS NORTH VIA THE SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE INTO THE BAY AREA AND SACRAMENTO AND BUS CONNECTIONS WELL SOUTH INTO THE LA BASIN AND ALSO AFFECTED IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WITH THE A SERVICE EXPENSE A DEEPER INTO PERCENT WE WILL CONNECT WITH THE A SYSTEM BUT ALSO MOVES INTO THE BAY AREA WILL HAVE. SERVICE SACRAMENTO. YEAH OF HUNDRED SAN ONE MILES. IS TO GENERATE. CONSIDERABLE JOB WE TWO HUNDRED THREE. THOUSAND JOB YEARS AND FORTY BILLION. TO THANKS FOR. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT- THIS ADMINISTRATION AND CERTAINLY THE AUTHORITY HAS RECOMMENDED THAT WE MOVE BEYOND THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES INTO A BETTER OPERATING SEGMENT IS WE WANT TO BRING TRAINS WERE THE PEOPLE ARE IN THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE SEGMENT ON THE SOUTHERN. TERMINUS TODAY TERMINATES AT A PLACE CALLED POPLAR AVENUE WHICH IS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN AGRICULTURAL AREA. AND WE ARE PROPOSING TO EXPAND THAT SERVICE TO THE DOWNTOWN BAKERSFIELD STREET SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BOB THE TERMINATION POINT IN THE SOUTH UNDER THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE SEGMENT. VERSUS WHAT WE PROPOSE THAT READ SEVENTY ONE MILES. THANK WHY. ON THE NORTH IT'S A SIMILAR STORY THE CURRENT TERMINATION POINT IS UP ROUGHLY THE MADERA- STATION AT NOW FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEM WHICH IS NEAR A SUBDIVISION POST TO A GOLF COURSE AND- AGAIN WE PROPOSED BY EXTENDING THE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE AFTER MERCED WE BRING THE TRAINED PEOPLE ARE CAN WE BRING IT TO A GREATER CONNECTION POINT WITH OTHER SERVICES INCLUDING X. AND SAMPARK TEENS AT THE MERCED STAGE. NEXT ONE. THE PROPOSAL THAT WE LAID OUT ON THE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE OF MILES WE WERE ASKED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO WORK WITH THE PEER REVIEW GROUP- TO HAVE A PEER REVIEW OF OUR RIDERSHIP FORECASTS- AND WHAT WE- HAVE. A DETERMINED AND PUT FORTH AS THE BENEFITS OF THAT PROGRAM WE WORK WITH THE PEER REVIEW GROUP. AFTER THE OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS OR SO. TO REVIEW OUR MODEL REVIEW HOW WE APPLIED THE MODEL. REVIEW OUR CONCLUSIONS FROM THE MODEL- AND- THE- THE GROUP CONCLUDED THAT WORK AT THE END OF THE YEAR. AND- WE PRESENTED THAT TO OUR BOARD. THE END OF DECEMBER AND NOW INCLUDED IN OUR- REVISED BUSINESS PLAN ON THE NEXT FLIGHT WAS IN MORE DETAIL. OF WHAT THEY CONCLUDED. THE CORPORATE GROUP GROW. AGAIN HELPED US DEFINE THE SCOPE OF THE REVIEW AND TO HELP US LOCATE OR- ADVISE YOU TO. DO THIS KIND OF WORK THIRD PARTY TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH AND ANALYTICS FIRM CALLED RESOURCE SYSTEMS GROUP DID THIS WORK. AND THEY CONCLUDED OUR REVIEW OF OUR- ALSO THEY FOUND NO FATAL FLAWS WITH THE WORK THAT WE WEREN'T. I TO SHIP S. WERE EXPECTED FOR WORK IN THE EXPECTED RANGES FOR THE TRAVEL TIME AND FREQUENCY AND IMPORTANTLY THEY THEY CONCURRED THAT THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT. OBTAINED HIGHEST FORECAST GAIN RIDERSHIP AND DID SOME WORK WHAT WAS INCREASE COST AND AGAIN AFTER WE HAD DONE SOME INTERNAL WORK WITH OUR EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR THOSE ARE THE CONCLUSIONS THAT WE REACH. AND WE FEEL LIKE THAT WAS IT FOR THE BY THE. ARTIST YOU GROUP NEXT ONE. AGAIN THE STATE UP FOR OR FROM THE VALUE OF THE MERCED BAKERSFIELD ROOM SERVICE- THOSE EXTENSIONS ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY CLEAR TODAY- THEREFORE WE RECOMMEND. THAT WE START TO ADVANCE SOME OF THE DESIGN WHICH WILL INCLUDE ENGINEERING. SO THAT WE CAN PERFORM RIGHT OF WAY MAPPING IDENTIFY UTILITY RELOCATIONS. UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF THIRD PARTY AGREEMENTS NEED TO GET ESTABLISHED YEAH THAT WAS THAT WAS THE PROJECT CORPORATE FOOTPRINT GET THE- OF THE WHOLE CONFIGURATION OF THE PROJECT LINE. THIS WILL HELP US REFINE OUR COST ESTIMATES AND WE'RE WE'RE PREPARED THESE. THESE EXPERT. BOB CORKER CONCERT ACT GOING FORWARD. I DO THANK YOU NOT I WANT TO SAY ONE THING HERE THAT- WE'RE WE'RE REQUIRED TO LAY OUT A VISION OF WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THE DOLLARS BEHALF IT'S PART OF WHAT WE ARE ASKED TO DO IN THE BUSINESS PLAN AND WHILE WE LAY THIS OUT IT IS FAIR TO SAY AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE GOOD QUESTIONS TO ASK ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN DO THIS- THAT YOU KNOW FUNDING WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO DO IT LIKE THAT IT MAKES SENSE. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I LARGELY CONCUR WITH SOME OF WHAT WE SAW THE PEER REVIEW GROUPS LETTER TO THE BOARD THAT'S YES WE DO SOME OF THIS WORK BUT WE DON'T RUN BEFORE WE COULD WALK WE ARE WORKING CAREFUL AND METHODICAL AND WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON WHY THIS OPTION IS THE BEST OTION IT WILL REQUIRE US TO DO SOME MORE WORK. TO BRING BACK IMPROVE THAT CASE BY I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT I HOPE WE CAN FIND A PLACE WHERE WE CAN AGREE ON HOW HOW AND WHERE WE CAN GO FORWARD NOW AND WHAT MADE TO WAIT A LITTLE BIT LONGER SO I JUST WANTED TO REACH OUT AND IN AGAIN SAY I RECOGNIZE THE POINT IS MADE IN THE PEER REVIEWED REVIEW. LETTER DISCONTENT. FIVE WHAT'S WHAT. OUR OUR OVERALL FUNDING- CONDITION LOOK UPS. TO WHERE WE IN OUR FEBRUARY DRAFT. BEGIN WE MENTIONED- TO TWENTY WILL TOUGH YOU ON. CAP AND TRADE IN TERMS OF GETTING. UP BY ABOUT TWO MINUTES EIGHT NINE DOLLARS. OVER THE COURSE OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM BUT NOW IS EXTENDS OUT TO. TWENTY THIRTY WE THINK UP WE RECOVER. MOST IF NOT ALL OF THAT MONEY. THROUGH THOSE ALLOWANCES ULTIMATELY BEING SOLD. OUR TOTAL FUNDING RANGE FOR THE PROGRAM. REMAINS BETWEEN ROUGHLY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS. UP FROM CAP AND TRADE RESOURCES PLUS. OF THE REMAINDER OF THE BOND MONEY THAT'S DEDICATED TO THIS PROJECT- AND THE FEDERAL FUNDS WE HAVE. OUR COST ESTIMATE AT THIS TIME TO COMPLETE THE PROCESS THE BAKERSFIELD MINE. IS IN THAT RANGE BETWEEN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION. THE BASE COST OF TWENTY TWO. AND AGAIN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. AND THAT MR ANNA SO YOU CAN TALK TO SUPPORT DETAIL WE HAVE. ALSO SUBMITTED A FUNDING PLAN TO- SICK FROM THE LEGISLATURE THE REMAINING. PROP ONE A. BOND FUNDS WE CAN COMPLETE THE CONSTRUCTION WORK IS CURRENTLY. UNDERWAY IN CENTRAL. NATURALLY WE ARE. ALREADY RUNNING A BIT TO BEHIND OUR IN. SCHEDULE SO THREE IT TO A PRIVATE SPEED THINGS ALONG. YEAH ABU QUICKLY THROUGH THIS. BOB THIS IS JUST A SLIDE THAT- YOU KNOW I TALK ABOUT CHALLENGES AND WE TALK ABOUT- THE SCHEDULE AND COST ISSUES BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT I THINK THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. WE ARE ADVANCING THIS PROJECT AT A PACE THAT. ARE JUST HAS NOT BEEN SEEN BEFORE- AND THIS CHART IS DESIGNED AS SORT OF REFLECT THAT. I STARTED ON THIS PROJECT TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THAT'S THE FIRST COLUMN THERE. OF HOW MANY CONSTRUCTION JOBS WE HAD UNDER WAY HELP INSTRUCTORS. WE HAD COMPLETED OR HAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION WHERE WE WERE ON ENVIRONMENTAL. AND THE THIRD COLUMN IS THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION WE HAVE ON THIS AT THIS POINT. AND THEN YOU CAN SEE THAT WE'VE MADE GREAT ADVANCEMENTS IN BOTH JOBS. STRUCTURES COMPLETED OR UNDERWAY WE'RE MOVING A MUCH QUICKER PACE ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS. RIGHT AWAY PARCELS OF. NOT FOR MILLION. WORKERS FOUR HUNDRED. WHICH WOULD START. IN YOU COULD SEE GENERALLY BAD. ONE ELEMENT OF SWIPE I THINK IS. TO POINT TO. YES BACK WHILE WROTE DESIGN COMPLETE. WHEN I GOT IN DECEMBER EIGHT I WAS. WILL NEED STEP HUNDRED FORTY. GO TO CONSTRUCT. AND THAT WAS INCORRECT WELL WE NEED TWENTY TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY THE REASON THAT WAS INCORRECT OURS BECAUSE THE PROJECT WAS NOT VERY FAR DESIGN FORTY SIX PERCENT. AND TODAY IT'S 95% DESIGN WHICH MEANS WE MAY HAVE A MUCH BETTER HANDLE ON EXACTLY WHAT'S WORSE WHAT WE HAVE TO BE A PLACE TO WORK. THAT'S IN PART WHY WE'RE MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD. NEXT LOCKED. BOB THIS IS JUST A QUICK UP INTEGRATION OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE COMING UP THAT ARE- MILESTONES WE WILL HIT- I WON'T GO INTO DETAIL ON THESE BECAUSE OF TIME AGAIN THESE ARE THINGS I'VE MENTIONED EARLIER THAT'S OUR MILESTONES THE PROGRAM WILL HIT THE NEXT TWELVE TO FIFTEEN MONTHS. NEXT ONE. THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE THAT I JUST WANNA PICK REPORT ON BECAUSE IT'S MOVE VERY SLOWLY FOR SOME TIME. BUT IS NOW PICKING UP PACE. WE ARE REQUIRED TO MATCH ALL THE FEDERAL FUNDS WOULD BE GIVEN ON THIS PROJECT TO DATE WE SPENT TWO POINT FIVE BILLION. WE HAVE NOW SENT THE STATE MATCH INVOICES. FOR THAT TOTAL BACK TO THE OPERATOR. OUR FEDERAL PARTNER THEY HAVE APPROVED ONE POINT SIX BILLION OF THOSE INVOICES AND THEY ARE CONTINUING TO REVIEW. THE LAST NINE HUNDRED MILLION BUT ALSO ALL TWO POINT FIVE INVOICES HAVE BEEN SENT BACK. AND THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THE REVIEW PROCESS. NEXT ONE. I WOULD BE REMISS IF I JUST DIDN'T MENTION THAT. OBVIOUSLY WE SEE POTENTIAL FOR. GREAT OPPORTUNITY AND A NEW AND IMPORTANT PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR FEDERAL PARTNER ON THIS PROJECT THEN CERTAINLY DIFFICULT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS BUT- THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY NOW TO RESTORE OUR FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP GET A MORE COLLABORATIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS PROJECT. WE ARE SEEKING WITH THE BUYING TEAM NOW THE SUPPLEMENT MEDICATION. BOB WORKING TO MAINTAIN ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS PROJECT BUT TRUMP ADMINISTRATION POST THANK- AND WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE FIGHTING. GROUPS ON AND H. I'M OBVIOUSLY THE NEW pADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS WILL ALSO BE TALKING ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING THIS YEAR AND WE'RE OUT AGAIN. OF HOPEFUL THAT THAT WILL INCLUDE THE FUNDING FOR PASSENGER RAIL OF ALL KINDS INCLUDING. HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU ARE NEXT ANALYSTS IS- MISTER THOMPSON. STRUCTURE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY. AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW ALL OF THE PEER REVIEW GROUP WAS CREATED BY AB THREE OH THREE FOUR AND OUR JOB IS TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH COMMENTS ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL REPORTS AND PROPOSALS THAT I HOPE WE CAN ADD TO THIS DISCUSSION TODAY. AS BRIAN MENTIONED OUR LETTER COMMENTING ON THE DRAFT REPLIES TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN WAS ON THE SEVENTH OF MARCH AND IT FORMS THE MORE DETAILED BACKGROUND OF THE REMARKS THAT I'M GOING TO SUMMARIZE TODAY. WHAT BEGIN BY SAYING THAT THERE IS SOME PROGRESS OR POSITIVE NEWS TO REPORT TO THE COMMITTEE OF FIRST OF ALL. RIGHT AWAY AND THIRD PARTY AGREEMENTS ARE COMING UNDER CONTROL AND THAT IS CONTRIBUTING TO GETTING THE EXISTING CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM UNDER BETTER CONTROL. THAN WHY WOULD ADD THAT THE EXISTING CONTRACTS HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT OVERRUNS AND YOUR BUDGET CHEN SCHEDULE. DUE TO HASTE IN GETTING THEM STARTED. WE BELIEVE FUTURE CONTRACTING WILL BENEFIT FROM THE LESSONS THAT THEY LEARNED. THE BETWEEN STATE STAFF AND CONTRACTORS BEING IMPROVED. THE STAGE GATE MANAGEMENT APPROACH THAT THE AUTHORITY DESCRIBES WILL ENSURE THAT CONTRACTS WILL PROCEED IN THE RIGHT SEQUENCE REDUCING DELAYS AND COSTLY CHANGE ORDERS. THE BY THE MINISTRATION AS WELL AND MENTIONED WE BELIEVE THIS WILL LIKELY TO GIVE REASONABLE CONSIDERATION TO THE REQUEST TO RELAX THE AREA DEADLINE AND TO RE OBLIGATE THE NINE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TEN FUNDING. MORE BROADLY THERE IS MORE REALISM AND WHAT THE AUTHORITY SAYS IT CAN AND CANNOT DO. THERE'S GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN COMPLETE WITH THE EXISTING FUNDING THE OBLIGATION UNDER THE ERROR AGREEMENT WHICH IS A HUNDRED AND NINETEEN MILE CENTRAL VALLEY SECTION WILL TRACK AND REMAINING ENVIRONMENTAL WORK. AND THEY COULD PROBABLY ADD ELECTRIFICATION OF THAT SECTION PURCHASE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF IN ROOM ROLLING STOCK AND CONDUCT MORE DETAILED ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF ADDED LINKS TO RUSSIA IN BAKERSFIELD AND THE MORE DIFFICULT WORK TUNNELING OUTSIDE THE. CVS BOUGHT. YOU TO COME THE- LINKS FROM MADERA MERCED AND FROM POPLAR AVENUE IN THE BAKERSFIELD IS MORE OF A CHALLENGE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. EJECTED COST TO COMPLETE THE AUTHORITIES WORDS ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL FUNDING NOW AVAILABLE IN THIS IS BEFORE A REALISTIC ALLOWANCE FROM RUNS ON WORK FROM WHICH THE ENGINEERING IS FAR FROM FULLY DETAILED. THERE'S A MYTHICAL POSSIBILITY THAT ADDED FUNDING BEYOND EXISTING SOURCES MAY BE REQUIRED ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE PROJECT HAS NOT YET EXPERIENCED ELECTRIFICATION SIGNALLING OR ROLLING STOCK PROCUREMENT. THE PROPOSAL TO OPERATE THE INTERIM SYSTEM BETWEEN MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD IS BASED ON A COMPLEX SET OF AGREEMENTS AND ACTIONS AMONG HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY SAN JOAQUIN JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY AND AT LEAST. THE CURRENT IMHO YOU DESCRIBES THESE AGREEMENTS BUT ACTUAL COMMITMENTS AND FUNDING TO BACK THEM UP ARE NOT IN PLACE- TO DELIVER THE PROPOSAL CALLS FOR LEASING THE LAND TO AN OPERATING SORRY THAT WOULD BE. TO PAY FOR USE OF THE LINE IN ROLLING STOCK PURCHASE BY THE AUTHORITY. BECAUSE THE STATE'S. THE JOAQUIN DRAWN AUTHORITY THIS MEANS THAT THE STATE WILL ULTIMATELY BE ON THE HOOK FOR WHATEVER HAPPENS TO THE OPERATING DEFICIT ON THE LINE. MOREOVER YOU AGREEMENT MAY BE SUBJECT TO LEGAL CHALLENGES OVER THE TERMS OF PROPOSITION ONE NAY CERTAINLY. THERE HAVE BEEN LEGAL CHALLENGES AT EVERY STEP IN THIS PROJECT. IN ANY EVENT- IT IS CLEAR THAT THE AUTHORITY WILL NEED TO ADDED FUNDING BEYOND EXISTING SOURCES IF IT IS TO GO BEYOND THE MERCED THE BAKERSFIELD SECTION. WITH THIS IN MIND OUR REPORT EMPHASIZES A NUMBER OF POINTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER FIRST. ASSUMING THAT BY MID MINISTRATIONS APPROVES A RELAXATION OF THE EARLY DEADLINE THERE WILL NO LONGER BE ANY MAJOR TIME PRESSURES THERE IS TIME TO FILL. ALTHOUGH THE AUTHORITY DOES APPEAR TO BE INCREASING ITS CONTROL OVER THE CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM THE LEGISLATURE COULD BE MORE CONFIDENT IF THAT CONTROL AS DEMONSTRATED OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAS DIRECTED THAT A SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE INCLUDING CHANGES TO THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION NETWORK. MUST BE DEVELOPED BY JULY FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS REPORT SHOULD CLARIFY THE GOVERNOR'S VIEW OF THE WORLD OF HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE OVERALL STATE SYSTEM AND HIS IDEAS FOR FUNDING. THIS COULD BE AN IMPORTANT BASIS FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERATION. I WANT TO ADD THAT THIS WELL THAT THE PROPOSAL'S FOR FURTHER WORK IMPLY AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE TO BUILD THE SYSTEM WILL CONTROL EAGLE MONEY IS AVAILABLE IF THAT AGREEMENT IS MINUS PLACE THE- NUMBER OF. YOU CHOOSE A PLAN SHOULD BE LEVERAGED. NEXT THE EXISTING MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING NEEDS TO BE TRANSLATED INTO A DETAILED AGREEMENT WITH FIRM MANAGEMENT UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS FROM THE STATE SEN MCCAIN JOINT COVERAGE OF THIRTY AN ACE. THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF THE PROPOSED OPERATION IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THE ACTORS IN FUNDING THAT ARE OUT OF THE CONTROL OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. I SHOULD ADD HOWEVER THAT 75% OF THE PROPOSED RIDERSHIP OF THIS INTERIM SYSTEM IS NOT HI SPEED BRIDGES ON THE LINK BETWEEN SACRAMENTO AND STOCKTON AND WILL BE A SYSTEM. SO IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PART OF THE SYSTEM IS INVESTED AND OPERATED EXACTLY THE WAY IT SHOULD. OVERRIDING ALL OF THIS IS THE SIMPLE FACT THAT EXISTING FUNDING SOURCES MAY WELL NOT BE ADEQUATE EVEN THIS INITIALLY ADDED LINKS IN THE INNER PROPOSAL. AND THEY WILL CERTAINLY NOT PERMIT ADDING LINKS OUTSIDE. SAID IT BAKERSFIELD DO FEDERAL FUNDING AND RECONSIDERATION OF ERA AND THE FISCAL TWENTY TEN MONEY IS A POSSIBILITY THAT MAY EMERGE MORE CLEARLY SIX MONTHS OR SO AND IT'S REASONABLE TO DEFER SCOPE IN STATE FUNDING DECISIONS UNTIL WE KNOW THE ANSWERS. BASED ON PAST FEDERAL PROGRAMS INSTRUCTOR THOUGH FEDERAL MONEY ALONE THEY WILL NOT SOLVE THE WHOLE PROBLEM ANYWAY SO ADDED STATE FUNDING IS A CLEAR POSSIBILITY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE AWARE OF. IN ANY CASE I WANT TO STRESS A POINT WE HAVE MADE BEFORE THAT MEANING OF THE PAST MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY FUNDING ISSUES AND IT WILL NEVER BE POSSIBLE IN THE FUTURE TO MANAGE THE PROJECT EFFECTIVELY WITHOUT ADEQUATE AND STABLE FUNDING. WHILE THESE ISSUES ARE BEING RESOLVED WE BELIEVE THE AUTHORITY SHOULD DEFER MAKING BINDING CONTRACT COMMITMENTS FELT SLIGHT ISSUE YES REQUIRED. THE WAY VANCE ENGINEERING IN THE LAND SONOMA MAJOR CIVIL WORKS OUTSIDE THE CVS. OF COURSE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;. GIVEN THE&lt;/c&gt;</u> IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT WE BELIEVE THAT WE SAID BEFORE THAT IMPROVED OVERSIGHT BY THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA. THE OVERSIGHT FUNCTION SHOULD HAVE ADEQUATE STAFFING. NEW WOULD BE NEEDED TO OVERSEE THE PROJECT PROGRESS OVER APPEARING IN YEARS NOT JUST ONE BUDGET CYCLE. THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION. I ALWAYS. ENJOY HEARING BEFORE YOU AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TRY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THOMPSON OUR FINAL- UP- SPEAK ON THIS PANEL IS HELEN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING KAREN MEMBERS MY NAME IS HELEN CRISTINA THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS MORNING'S HEARING I WANT TO FOCUS MY BRIEF REMARKS ON A KEY DECISION FACING THE LEGISLATURE WHICH IS HOW TO APPROACH AN UPCOMING REQUEST FOR THE APPROPRIATION OF ALMOST ALL OF THE REMAINING PROPOSITION ONE A FUN. THIS UPCOMING OPERATION REQUEST PRESENTS AND NATURAL OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE THE PROPOSED DIRECTION OF THE PROJECT AND ENSURE THAT IT OUTLINES WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. WE KNOW WHETHER SUCH NATURAL OPPORTUNITY MAY NOT EMERGE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THERE ARE TWO KEY CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THAT MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THIS APPROPRIATIONS REQUEST. FIRST BUT I THINK YOU'LL WANT TO CONSIDER ITS LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE THAT IT WILL FUNDING BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THAT WERE SENT TO BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT. SO I WAS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THE AUTHORITY EXPECTED EXISTING FUNDING WILL BE ROUGHLY SUFFICIENT TO COMPLETE THE REVISED SCOPE OF PERCENT TO BAKERSFIELD AND THIS IS A SINGLE TRACK WITH PRETTY BASIC STATION PLATFORMS. HOWEVER HISTORICALLY PROJECT COSTS HAVE INCREASED OVER TIME WE THINK THAT THERE'S DEFINITELY RISK THAT THIS WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN OR THAT SOMEBODY EXPECTED FUNDING MIGHT NOT MATERIALIZE SO THIS MEANS THAT EXISTING FUNDING MIGHT NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO COMPETE EVEN NEVER. SENT TO BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT. SECOND THE LEGISLATURE- WANT TO CONVEY COMMITTEE TO FULL FUNDING PROJECT. IS ITS LEVEL OF. TO MEETING A FUNDING GAP IF ANY THAT COULD. YOU CAN. THEM TODAY. THANK MY- AS WELL AS ITS COMMITMENT TO FUNDING. SECOND SUCH AS THE BALLOT ABOUT LINE AND PHASE ONE. WHICH CERTAINLY REFER NEW THING SOURCES. IF THE LEGISLATURE COMMITTED TO. WERE SET TO BAKER. EVA IF THE FUNDING EMERGED AND IS ALSO COMMITTED TO FINDING FUTURE PROJECT SEGMENTS AND WE THINK THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY'S PROPOSED APPROACH. SEEMS PRETTY REASONABLE- IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO REFINANCE AT THIS EXPECTED TO BE REQUESTED BY THE AUTHORITY. HOWEVER IF THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T WANT TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO FINDING RESENTED BAKERSFIELD AND FUTURE SEGMENTS AT THIS TIME WE SUGGEST IT MAY WANT TO TAKE ANOTHER APPROACH THAT WOULD PROVIDE- MORE FLEXIBILITY AND ALSO. MAXIMIZE STANDALONE VALUE OF WHATEVER INFRASTRUCTURE IS COMPLETED. SO IN THIS CASE THERE ARE TWO MAIN OPTIONS FIRST ALLEGED YOUR IF ITHAD A SPECIFIC APPROACH IN MIND THAT WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE. FOR EXAMPLE KNOWING THE PROJECT SCOPE TO WHAT'S REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENT AND THAT WOULD BE TOO BIG REALLY CONSTRUCTION OF A USABLE SEGMENTS- AND THAT ONE NINETEEN MILES NOT NECESSARILY ELECTRIFICATION. IT COULD NOT STATUTORY LANGUAGE DIRECTING THE AUTHORITY ACCORDINGLY. SECOND IF THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC APPROACH THAT WOULD LIKE TO COMMITTEE NOW IT COULD TAKE ACTIONS. TO PRESERVE ITS ACCESSIBILITY. WOULD LIKELY DELAY ACTION ON. OR ALL OF THE PROPOSED APPROPRIATION REQUEST. I'M IN THIS WOULD PRESERVE NATURALLY. MAKING POINT PEOPLE. WE THINK IT WOULD ALSO LIKE INCLUDE ADOPTING STATUS LANGUAGE. THE F. FROM ENTERING CONTRACTS THAT WOULD COMMIT THE STATE TO APPROACH SUCH AS ELECTRIFICATION. SO THAT FOR EXAMPLE THAT CATEGORY LIKE WHICH COULD PREVENT THE AUTHORITY FROM THE SAME LETTER BY TRAINS. AT THIS TIME OR AND COMMITTING THE STATE'S YOU. CONSTRUCTING WATER BY CAPTAIN SYSTEMS. ARE ALSO HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU A MISS CHRISTINE I APOLOGIZE FOR MISPRONOUNCING YOUR NAME EARLIER- THAT BRINGS US TO THE CONCLUSION OF- OF- THIS. HANDLE AND I AM GOING TO- A PASS ON ASKING- AND INITIAL QUESTION AND ASK MISS BRIDGEMAN IF SHE WOULD LIKE TO COMMENCE OF CLASSES AND TO MEMBERS PLEASE JUST TO INDICATE IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION I'LL TRY TO. KEEP AN EYE ON IT. INCLUDE EVERYONE I JUST TO BE CLEAR WE'RE GOING TO ASK ONE QUESTION AND THEN PASS IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE COMMITTEE CORRECTED I ASK YOU TO MAKE YOUR QUESTIONS AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE AND- PANELISTS- KEEP YOUR- RESPONSES AS- CONCISE AS POSSIBLE. I HATE MY FIRST QUESTION IS FOR MR KELLY I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR HIS PRESENTATION- SO. AT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT AS TO- COMPLETING THIS PROJECT AND THEN DEMONSTRATING THAT IT SHOULD BE- CONTINUED THROUGH TO LOS ANGELES AND BAY AREA SAN DIEGO- ONE IDEA IS THAT THIS SECTION- EITHER CONFIGURATION OF SECTION WILL GENERATE SO MUCH RIDERSHIP THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WILL. WILL DEMAND THAT THEY NOW HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED RAIL AND THE OTHER THOUGHT IS THAT ONCE THEY SEE A FAST TRAIN RUNNING IT UNDERSTAND IT CAN BE BUILT. THEN THAT WOULD KIND OF DO THE SAME THING SO MY QUESTION IS WHY YOU BELIEVE. THAT. THIS HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILE SECTION WOULD HAVE ENOUGH RIDERSHIP. TO DEMONSTRATE THE VIABILITY OF THIS PROJECT I MEAN CERTAINLY WE KNOW THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL CAN BE BUILT THIS IS NOT NEW TECHNOLOGY THIS IS FORTY AT LEAST FORTY YEAR OLD TECHNOLOGY THAT WE SEE USED AROUND THE WORLD SO IT'S NOT THAT IT'S A NEW THING THAT. IS GONNA BLOW PEOPLE'S MINDS RIGHT SO WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT A SINGLE TRACK SYSTEM THROUGH THESE AREAS IS GOING TO HAVE SO MUCH RIDERSHIP. THAT. IT WILL CONVINCE US TO FUND THE REST. AS OPPOSED. OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT WE KNOW WILL WORK REYES RIDERSHIP. WHY DON'T I GUESS I'M PERSON I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THOSE ARE BUT LET ME JUST SAY. THE APPROACH THAT WE'RE TAKING IS NOT IT IS REALLY. IN MY VIEW A PRAGMATIC APPROACH BASED ON WHERE WE ARE ON THE PROJECT AT THIS TIME. AND THE AMOUNT OF. RESOURCES WE HAVE. TO BRING IT FORWARD TO DEVELOP SOMETHING THAT IS OF VALUE. AND USABLE AND CAN DEMONSTRATE WHAT ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL CAN DO. WHICH I DON'T THINK WHICH I KNOW IS AVAILABLE AROUND THE WORLD BUT IS NOT AVAILABLE ANYWHERE IN AMERICA. AND IS NOT SOMETHING CALIFORNIANS CAN EXPERIENCE HERE AT HOME. AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE SAID LOOK. AT THIS MONEY TO BUILD A HUNDRED NINETY MILE STRETCH INTHE VALLEY. THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN TERMINATION TERMINATION POINT OF THAT ARE NOT AN IDEAL OPERATING RUN. IF WE EXTEND FURTHER INTO THE CITIES AND THE WAY WE GET TO AN OPERATING RUN. THAT BOTH ARE ADVISORS BURKE WHO RUN HIGH SPEED RAIL. TODAY AND A PEER REVIEW GROUP HAVE CONFIRMED- A REASONABLE ASSUMPTION IS IT WILL PROVIDE ENHANCED RIDERSHIP MORE THAN DOUBLING. THE RIDERSHIP IN THE VALLEY ON TODAY'S SERVICE VERSUS A NO BUILD OPTION JUST LEAVING TODAY'SDIESEL SERVICE THAT SHARES FREIGHT TRAFFIC. WE WANT TO USE THE ASSETS THAT WE NOW HAVE UNDER CONSTRUCTION. TO PROVIDE A VALUABLE INTERIM SERVICE WHILE WE COMPLETE THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK ACROSS THE STATE FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LA IN ANAHEIM- IN ADVANCE THOSE SEGMENTS. TOWARD CONSTRUCTION WHEN MONEY BECOMES AVAILABLE. SO FOR US. PUZZLE IS. A MORE. EARLY PRAGMATIC WAY SAY HERE'S THE BUDGET WE KNOW WE HAVE WHAT WE THINK WE CAN DO WITH THAT IS IT A VALUE TO CALIFORNIANS A PARTICULARLY A PLACE LIKE THE CENTRAL VALLEY DOES NOT HAVE A TON OF TRANSIT OPTIONS AND IS IN A GOOD PLACE TO START-DEMONSTRATING WHAT THIS CAN DO AS WE EXPAND OUT OF THE BALLOT AND LOOK WE STARTED IN THE VALLEY WE'RE INVESTING BILLIONS IN THE VALLEY. AND TO GET THAT WORK DONE AND MAKE SOMETHING OF VALUE IN OPERATIONAL THERE BUT WE THINK WE NEED TO EXTEND INTO THE CITIES OF THE VALLEY AND BY DOING THAT WE CAN GET OPERATIONS RUN GOING AND THEN WE CONSIDERED HOW TO EXPAND. THANK YOU OF MR PATTERSON IS NEXT UP FOLLOWED BY MISS NGUYEN WHO IS SUCH A- GOING TO BE- REMOTE- WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOES SOMETHING OF VALUE- LET ME JUST SAY THAT CENTRAL CALIFORNIA'S BEEN THE GUINEA PIG IN. ALL OF THIS. THAT I'VE BEEN HERE EIGHT YEARS AND HAVE SEEN REPEATED BUSINESS PLANS. AND THEY ALL HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON THEY COST MUCH MUCH MORE AND BUILD. MUCH MUCH LESS. FRESNO IN PARTICULAR IS WE'RE GETTING RIPPED UP OUR LANDSCAPE OUR FARMLAND OR CITYSCAPES THERE'S ACCESS PROPERTY TURNING IN. THE BLIGHT WE HAVE BEEN PROMISED SOMETHING OF VALUE. YOU CAN IMAGINE OUR DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN THE PLAN CAME FORWARD. THAT IT WOULD HAVE A ONE TRACK. ON PAGE SIXTY pNINE ON PAGE SEVENTY ON PAGE NINETY ONE THE AUTHORITY EMPHASIZES AND RE EMPHASIZES THIS SINGLE TRACK APPROACH. WHEN WE LOOK AT IT THROUGH THE EYES OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. WE SEE. THAT THIS WILL BE A ONE TRACK. EMPTY TRAINS NO STATIONS AND I GUESS NO PASSENGERS IN IN TEST MODE. OR MAYBE FIVE YEARS OR PERHAPS. LONGER AND SO OUR DISAPPOINTMENT IS THAT WE HAVE. BANTUS ABATING AND HAVE MADE A LOT OF LOCAL COMMITMENTS AND YET WE'RE STILL RIPPED UP AND WE NOW EXPECT A SINGLE TRACK- THAT- I THINK CAN HAVE A HARD TIME DEMONSTRATING THEIR VALUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF YOU CAN. GET THAT MIGHT GET TO THE QUESTION. SO CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT POSSIBLE VALUE. IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA FOR A- FOR A SINGLE TRACK. NO PASSENGERS. NO STATIONS. AB WHY CAN'T CENTRAL CALIFORNIA SEE THIS AS A BETRAYAL. AND SEE IT AS NOT ONLY JUST. RIPPING US UP BUT RIPPING US OFF. WELL I GUESS MY ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION WOULD BE THAT- WE CLEARLY DON'T SEE IT THE SAME WAY AND AUG THE OPTION ON THE SINGLE TRACK VERSUS THE DOUBLE TRACK ONE- WILL STILL HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE PASSENGERS THAN THE- CURRENT NO BUILD OPTION AND JUST LEAVING TODAY'S DIESEL POWERED PASSENGER TRAIN SERVICE IN THE BALLOT. BUT LIKE TO FIGHT HIGH SPEED RAIL ON ONE OR TWO TRACKS WILL STILL HAVE THE OPERATIONAL BENEFITS AND MEET THE OPERATIONAL- THE OPERATIONAL COMMITMENTS AND OBJECTIVES THAT WE SET ABOUT THE DOUBLE TRACK THE ISSUE IS NOT DO WE EVER DO THE DOUBLE TRACK IT'S WHEN DO WE- AND- WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING HERE IS AS A WAY TO. CONSIDER DOING THIS IN A MORE METHODICAL APPROACH AND STAY WITHIN BUDGET. LIMITATIONS THAT WE CAN DO THIS ONE TRACK AT A TIME WITHOUT SACRIFICING OPERATIONAL BENEFITS. AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING. OUR BUSINESS PLAN CONTAINS ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO INVEST IN STATIONS AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT ARE PART. OF BUILDING THE BAKERSFIELD MERCED STRETCH FOUR STATIONS IN PARTICULAR THAT UP WILL MOST CERTAINLY. BE DEVELOPED IN A WAY TO MAKE SURE PASSENGERS GIVE ACCESS AND GET ON AND OFF THE TRAIN SAFELY AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH COMMUNITIES ON HOW TO DEVELOP. AROUND THE STAGE AND THAT'S WORK WE HAVE UNDERWAY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITIES OF THE BALLOT ON. SO FOR US IT'S MORE LIKE. THERE ARE THINGS WE WANT TO CONSIDER WE WANT THE BIDDERS THE TRACKING SYSTEMS THINGS OUT TO BID. TODAY LIKE THE BIDDERS TO PROPOSE IT AS A COUPLE OF OPTIONS WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE IF YOU DO ONE TRACK FIRST AND THE SECOND TRACK. LATER WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE IF YOU DO ONLY TWO TRACKS. UP AND WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE YOU COULD DO ONE TRACK AND SO. ARE OUR BEST ESTIMATE ON THIS IS THAT- THE OPERATIONAL BENEFITS. ARE- PERSONALLY THE SAME. OR THE INTERIM SERVICE MEMBERS SAID TO BAKERSFIELD ONE TRACKER TO IT DOES INCLUDE. PASSING AREAS AT- MAINTENANCE FACILITIES AND AT STATIONS- WHETHER BE A SECOND TRACK AND THERE'S ALSO AN OPTION TO BUILD. ADDITIONAL SITES BUT WE'D LIKE TO BE INFORMED BY THE BIDS TO FIGURE OUT HOW BEST TO PROCEED. BUT THE IDEA AS A WAY TO GET THE OPERATING SEGMENT IN PLACE. BRINGING DELIVERY AND VALUE TO THE RIDERS CENTRAL VALLEY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE SAID. IN THE EARLIER APPROACH. THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WIN FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD AND RUFUS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THIS THE QUESTION I HAVE IS FOR L. A. O. IF WE ARE STARTING. UN SO THE ACTUALLY THE PLAN SET BEFORE US IS TO BILL FOR MORE STEP TO BAKERSFIELD SINGLE TRACK WHICH WILL COST TWENTY TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. YET THE HIGH SPEED RAILS ESTIMATE REVENUE IS TWENTY ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS LEAVING A BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT FOR THE PROJECT AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS JUST WITHIN THAT TRACK. NOW QUESTION FOR THE L. A. O. IS. IT WHERE BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT NOW IN THE HOLE JUST FOR THIS PART. DO YOU SEE IT BEING TOO RISKY FOR THE LET'S SAY TO THAT THE STORY MOVE FORWARD ON A PLAN THAT. WE'RE IN A DEFICIT ALREADY. GIVEN THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO FINISH THE HIGH SEED RAIL IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WE'RE NOT EVEN. TALKING ABOUT. A PORTION OF STUDY IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS WHERE I REPRESENT. AT ALL WE'RE STILL. AT THE BEGINNING. CAN YOU KIND OF JUST GIVE US. YOUR WHAT YOU'VE SEEN IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL OPINION. IS IT TOO RISKY OR NOT. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO DID YOU ALREADY HAVE BEEN. MADE AS WELL AS A RANGE OF. I THINK I MEAN TO BE INVOLVED WELL AND SO IT TURNS OUT THAT. ABOUT BUT IF YOU THOSE POINTS BECAUSE MY CHILDREN. TO M. NOT BE SUFFICIENT FUNDING AND THE CERTIFICATE COULD YOU ON FOR A SECOND WE'RE NOT. AN ACTIVITY YEAH. I DON'T. AND RICHARD TO CAN SLOW DOWN SURE GEN WHERE IT WOULD GOT A REQUEST THE YOU SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT BUT I'M NOT HAVE TO ASK TO START OVER WHEN WE'RE READY. WELL IF YOU COULD TURN YOUR- HELPFUL WITH THE THAT'LL AND FOR YOUR AUTO. LET'S GIVE THAT A TRY THANK YOU ABOUT THAT. EACH SO- SO ESSENTIALLY IT'S ALREADY PRE BOTH RAIN FOR THE COST AS WELL AS THE FUNDING AS WELL AS POINT ESTIMATES MAKING WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS THAT IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE POINT ESTIMATES IT APPEARS THERE'S A FUNDING GAP- THERE'S CERTAINLY SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT THE FUNDING WILL BE- BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT FOR EXAMPLE CAP AND TRADE WILL BRING AND THERE'S ALSO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT THE COSTS ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE PARTICULARLY WITH THOSE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD EXTENSION. ON THEIR END EARLY DESIGN PHASES AND SO THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT EXACTLY THOSE COSTS WILL BE BUT I THINK AS YOU NOTED- EVEN WITH THEIR ESTIMATES- IT'S UNCLEAR IF THERE'S SUFFICIENT FUNDING AT THIS POINT IN TERMS OF THAT THE QUESTION OF RISK IT REALLY IS I THINK FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER HOW RISK AVERSE LEGISLATURE IS RIGHT ACCURATE MORE RISK AVERSE MANDATE YOU PROBABLY WOULD WANT ONE- YOU KNOW. FIRST CONNECTS WITH SMALLER SCOPE FOR EXAMPLE SO MAYBE WE CAN GET TO DURING THE FEDERAL AND THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENT- FOR A GRANT AGREEMENT AND THAT'S JUST THAT INITIAL ONE NINETEEN MILES NOT ELECTRIFIED YOU CAN DO THAT TO SEE WHERE THAT GOES ON YOU CAN MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY AND MAKE SURE ALL THE CONTACTS REALLY JUST JUST KIND OF COMING INTO THAT I'M SORRY YOUR GOVERNMENT HERE MORE RISK AVERSE THAT MIGHT BE THE APPROACH THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO TAKE. IF YOU ARE WILLING TO TAKE ON MORE RISK THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TO BE SHOULD FUNDING- AND THAT AND THAT EDUCATIONAL FUNDING WILL NEED TO BE IDENTIFIED EVEN TO COMPLETE RESPECTIVE BAKERSFIELD AND CERTAINLY TO COMPLETE ADDITIONAL WORK BEYOND PERSPECTIVE BAKERSFIELD IF YOU IF YOU ARE WILLING TO TOLERATE MORE ABOUT RISK- COURT ABOUT RISK- YOU TAKE THAT THE THIS PARTIES YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE MORE ABOUT RIGHT THANK YOU MIGHT BE MIGHT BE COMFORTABLE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY APPROACHED. I THINK IT REALLY DEPENDS ON ON THAT RISK TOLERANCE AND BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE HAD AGAIN TO FULLY FUNDING THAT PROJECT BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD BE PERHAPS PROBLEMATIC IT TO END UP WITH JUST ONE HUNDRED NINETY MILES. BETTER ELECTRIFIED AND NO DESIRE SPEND A DAY. MONEY BECAUSE- THAT KIND OF SMALL. A PROBLEM DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. TO RUN. ELECTRIFIED TRAINS ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT MILES. SHALL MEDINA. RIGHT AND SO. YOU IF YOU'RE GONNA. NOT GONNA WANT TO A- SAID. BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO MAKE THAT YOU. TO SAY THAT YOU CAN CONNECT IN TERMS OF SERVICE. I DON'T KNOW ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BUT IT'S REALLY. ABOUT YOUR RISK TOLERANCE. ADD TO THAT ALL YOU CAN HEDGE YOUR RISKS THIS WAS THE POINT THAT WE WERE MAKING JUST WAIT. TILL AT LEAST THE SUMMER AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE FEDERAL MONEY AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH FURTHER ENGINEERING WORK BUT THE AUTHORITIES PROPOSING TO DO ON THOSE TWO LINKS. AFTER WHICH THE PICTURE OF WHAT THEY CAN WHETHER THEY CAN PAY FOR THAT WITHIN THE JUST THING OR THE NEW SOURCES. IS TRUE OR NOT- WE BELIEVE AND SAID THAT RIGHT NOW IT IS UNCERTAIN FOR SURE WHETHER. THE EXISTING SOURCES WILL PAY FOR THOSE SWINGS THAT SEEMS TO BE CLEAR. THANK YOU. OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD ALSO REMOTELY. THANK YOU CHAPLAIN MY COUNTY HERE OKAY. PLEASE PROCEED RIGHT THANK YOU- I APPRECIATE B. OVERVIEW TODAY- FOR ALL THE PRESENTATIONS I ALSO APPRECIATE THE AUTHORITIES- CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO MEET WITH ME AHEAD OF THIS TO REALLY DIVE A LOT DEEPER INTO SOME OF MY CONSTITUENTS IS PERSPECTIVES ON THIS PROJECT- I HAD TWO QUESTIONS TODAY ONE- WHAT IS THE EITHER AGENCY OR ANYBODY ELSE FROM GOVERNMENT DOING TO PROACTIVELY REACH OUT TO FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVES AND THE NEW ADMINISTRATION I DON'T WANT TO WAIT UNTIL THE SUMMER I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE GOING TO BE ON THEIR OWN TIME LINE BUT WHAT ARE WE DOING RIGHT NOW TO REALLY TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HAVING. THOSE RESOURCES OR THE PROSPECT OF THOSE RESOURCES COMING TO HELP MITIGATE SOME OF THE STATE'S- IT- REQUIREMENTS- TO BE ABLE TO KEEP US ON TRACK AND THEN SECONDLY FROM SOME OF THE- BOTH MEDIA REPORTS AND OTHER- OTHER INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN CIRCULATING OUT THERE I'VE GOT SOME DEEP CONCERN ABOUT THAT CONTRACTORS THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW NOT BENG ON TIME NOT MEETING THEIR GOALS HAVING ADDITIONAL CHANGE ORDERS- AND- AND NOT STICKING TO WHAT WHAT OUR AGREEMENT IS SO WHAT ARE WE DOING TO PROTECT TAXPAYERS INTERESTS FOR THE AGREEMENTS THAT WERE SET IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE- THAT WE ARE NOT JUST STUCK WITH THE- AND- POTENTIALLY UNSCRUPULOUS- PARTNER IN THIS- JUST CONTINUES TO BE ABLE TO. LEAVE THESE MONIES AND THEN COMES BACK AND ASK US FOR MORE- SO THOSE ARE THE TWO QUESTIONS I HAVE- I WOULD ALSO I DON'T EAT RESPONSIBLY IN THE INTEREST OF TIME BUT I AM VERY INTERESTED- TO SOME MEMBER AND WHEN'S POINT OF VIEW REPRESENTING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO REACH AND- REALLY EXPRESS THAT I WANT TO SEE A LOT MORE HAPPENED FOR FEES TO IN OTHER SEGMENTS AS WELL THAT ARE GOING TO GUARANTEED- STUDIO RIDERSHIP HAPPENING IN A REASONABLE TIME FRAME I KNOW THAT MIGHT BE VERY COSTLY I KNOW THAT THAT IS GOING TO COME WITH ITS OWN SET OF HURDLES- BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT DOWN HERE TO BE ABLE TO- WANT TO SUPPORT THIS AS WE DID BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND- EIGHTEEN. UNLESS WE ARE. SIMULTANEOUSLY ONE ISSUE A FAMILY WORKS. WE'RE S. WE'RE AT- I'VE AND TO AVOID SPEECHES AND NOW YOU VIOLATED MY OTHER TO WHICH WAS STAYING ONE DAY ONE QUICK THE- I- I MISTER ROGERS. YOU I'M TRYING TO HOLD TO THE SAME RULES. SO IF IT'S ALL WITH YOU I'M GONNA- ALLOW THE PANELISTS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS- BUT FOR THE REST OF YOU LET'S TRY PLEASE TO IS HERE TO THE ONE. QUESTION RULE. MISTER CHAIRMAN TO THE EXTENT THAT QUESTION THOSE QUESTIONS ARE DIRECTED TO ME- LET ME BOB. FIRST DAY ON THE FEDERAL SIDE- WORK IT'S HARD TO. OVERSTATE THE DIFFERENCE IN RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND THE CURRENT ONE AND THIS AND- IN THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION THERE WAS NO DIALOGUE- ACTIONS WERE HOSTILE. AND ATTEMPTS TO TAKE MONEY FROM THE PROJECT. HEARD US. AND IT AND IT AND IT SLOWED SOME OF OUR WORK. OKAY THE NEW ADMINISTRATION HAS COME AND- THAT WE ARE IN NEAR CONSTANT COMMUNICATION. ABOUT EXACTLY WHERE THE PROJECT IS. WHERE IT IS WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO GO ON THIS. AND WE ARE SEEKING THEIR INPUT. ON HOW WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS PROJECT. SO I WANT TO SAY THAT WE ARE COMMUNICATING IN A VERY HIGH LEVEL. AND A VERY CONSTANT LEVEL ON THINGS I MENTIONED EARLIER. BUT UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THEY ATTEMPTED TO TAKE UP ROUGHLY A BILLION DOLLARS AWAY. FROM THE PROJECT FOR FEDERAL MONEY THAT WAS GRANTE TO THIS PROJECT. WE WENT TO COURT TO SUE. TO STOP THAT ACTION. AND WE ARE NOW WORKING WITH THE BY NEED MINISTRATION ON HOW WE SETTLE. THAT ACTION TO. KEEP THE FEDERAL HERE. CERTAINLY WE ARE ALSO ADVOCATES WERE ALL OF OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AND THE BY THE MINISTRATION. ON MAKING SURE THAT THE BILL BACK BETTER PROPOSAL IS THAT COMES FORTH LATER THIS SPRING. THAT INCLUDES. YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP FOR PASSENGER RAIL AND PARTICULARLY. FOR CLEAN PASSENGER RAIL. AND SO WE THINK THAT THOSE ARE ELEMENTS THAT THEY SUPPORT. WE ARE EXPECTING THAT- WE WILL SEE OPPORTUNITY WHEN THAT PROGRAM COMES FORWARD WE EXPECT TO SEE IT MAYBE LATER THIS MONTH. AND WE THINK WE HAVE A REAL SHOT TO ADVANCE CALIFORNIA'S NOT JUST THIS PROJECT BUT- ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO BUILD CLEAN TRANSIT. WHICH ARE PROBABLY LEADING THE NATION- AND SO WE SEE GREAT OPPORTUNITY WE ARE IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION. WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS. ON THE SECOND QUESTION. ALL THE GUYS TAKE UP MORE TIME AND MAYBE UP A LONGER CONVERSATION ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD WHICH I'M HAPPY TO HAVE YOU AND I APPRECIATED. THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT IN ADVANCE OF THIS. BUT IN TERMS OF. CONTRACTORS IN CHANGE ORDERS I MEAN I WILL SAY THIS AND I JUST TESTIFIED. TO THIS. MISS COMMITTEE BEFORE- CLEARLY WHEN WE GOT INTO THE CONSTRUCTION ON THIS PROJECT- BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND THIRTEEN. FOURTEEN I WOULD CONSTRUCTION FIRST GOT UNDER WAY THE PROJECT WAS NOT. DEVELOPED ENOUGH IN TERMS OF THE DID NOT DESIGN BEING DONE. RIGHT AWAY WAS NOT. A PART OF A LONG BEFORE A CONSTRUCTION COMMENCED CONSTRUCTION DID COMMENCE. WHAT DO A LOT OF FACTORS AT THAT TIME INCLUDING UP UP PRESS TO SPEND FEDERAL MONEY BY A DEADLINE- IN THE UPSIDE OF THAT IS THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WORK. AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND JOBS WERE CREATED THE DOWNSIDE WAS A LOT OF WORK WAS DONE AT RISK. AND NOT SEQUENCING THE WORK. AS YOU TYPICALLY WOULD- IT LED TO THAT SCPE CHANGES. OTHER CHANGES IN THE PROJECT THAT. WE HAVE TO NOW- FULFILL WE HAVE TO FINISH ABOUT WHAT THOSE CODE CHANGES LOOK LIKE WE HAVE TO NOW THE PROJECT AS I SAID. YESTERDAY IN MY PRESENTATION WHEN I STARTED HERE IS ABOUT 45% DESIGN. IT'S HARD TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND WHAT RIGHT AWAY YOU NEED YEAH. EXACTLY WHERE IT'S GONNA GO IF YOU'RE ONLY THAT PART DESIGNED TO DATE WHERE 95% WILL BE A 100% DESIGNED BY APRIL. AND THAT MEANS NOW WE HAVE A HANDLE ON EXACTLY WHAT RIGHT AWAY WE DO NEED. AND WE'RE DANCING THE BALL WE HAVE ABOUT 80% OF IT IN HAND. AND WE WILL MOVE FORWARD LET'S GET THE REST OF IT IN THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS. OR SO- IT'S SO. JANE ORDERS ARE NOW OF. SORT OF ANSWERING QUESTIONS THAT WERE LEFT UNANSWERED WHEN THE PROJECT WAS NOT FULLY DESIGN AND NOW YOU'RE GETTING THE FULL DESIGN AND YOU HAVE TO EXECUTE CHANGE ORDERS TO FINISH THAT WORK AND SO THAT'S GOING TO BE WITH US THROUGH THIS HUNDRED NINETY MILE STRETCH HOWEVER OUR BUDGET ESTIMATES ACCOUNT FOR THAT. IN OUR BUDGET ESTIMATE NOW THAT IS FULLY DESIGN- WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE RISKS ARE AND WHAT THAT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE NOW MOVING FORWARD TO WHICH- END UP ALL OF THESE THINGS YOU KNOW CONTRACTORS GENERALLY CLAIM TOO MUCH AND WE COME IN WITH A DIFFERENT NUMBER AND OFTEN THESE THINGS GET THE BILL SHE ADDED. AND- YEAH NOBODY'S PARTICULARLY HAPPY BUT WE HAVE TO DO THAT BUT TO GET THIS WORK DONE AND I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT WE AS AN ORGANIZATION HAVE TO DO IS UNDERSTAND THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THAT BAD START. A LOT OF THINGS DIDN'T GO AS IT SHOULD HAVE AND AS WE GO FORWARD FOR HOW WE WILL DO CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS. GOING FORWARD WE WILL BE IMPLEMENTING OUTLINED THIS IN CHAPTER SIX OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN A VERY METHODICAL AND DISCIPLINED STAGE GATE PROCESS SO THAT WE DON'T DO CONTRACTS OUT OF SEQUENCE WE DO THEM IN SEQUENCE AT THE I THINK THAT'LL HELP US AVOID. A PROBLEM. THANK YOU MS THREE. FOLLOWED BY. THE SMITH. AND MR FONG. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THAT ARE OF YES THANK YOU- FOR THE PRESENTATIONS ON THIS TOPIC I KNOW A LOT OF US HAVE BEEN VERY ENGAGED IN HIGH SPEED RAIL- AND YOU KNOW I REMAIN CONCERNED THAT IT MAY BE PREMATURE TO BE HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT ALLOCATING THE REMAINING BOND FUNDS RIGHT NOW WHEN WE DON'T HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT LEVEL OF FUNDING OR FEDERAL MATCHES THAT WE CAN EXPECT FROM WASHINGTON TODAY- I HOPE THAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DO PROGRESS- AND GIVE US A BETTER SENSE. OF HOW MUCH THEY'RE WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS PROJECT- BUT YOU KNOW I WORRY THAT INSUFFICIENT FUNDING COULD LEAVE US WITH INFRASTRUCTURE THAT DOESN'T ACCOMPLISH THE VISION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL AND DOESN'T BENEFIT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- AND SO THAT'S THAT I AM STILL CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND I THINK WE NEED FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THAT- IN WITH THOSE CONCERNS I THINK ARE THERE ALTERNATIVES YOU KNOW FOR FROM THE CURRENT PLAN OF- AS YOUR- MEMBER NUMBER SAID TO BAKERSFIELD LINE AND I KNOW. OF YEARS A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND BUDGETS OF THREE I REQUESTED- A STUDY OF POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES TO THAT- PLAN AND I JUST WANNA KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON AN ALTERNATIVE TO- WERE SAID TO BAKERSFIELD GIVEN THAT WE MAY HAVE INSUFFICIENT FUNDING TO COMPLETE OF. THE FULL VERSION OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I THINK I WOULD ANSWERED THIS WAY WE- MY BOARD DIRECTED OUR STAFF BACK IN I THINK IT WAS TWENTY NINETEEN ORIGINALLY. TO CONDUCT A SIDE BY SIDE. ROB REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF WOULD BE MONIES WE WERE THEN IDENTIFYING AS THE INCREMENTAL ABOUT BETWEEN WHAT IT TAKES TO COMPLETE OUR FEDERAL FUNDING GRANT REQUIREMENTS WHICH ARE THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES OF TRACK. AND ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK DONE STATEWIDE IN ADDITION. COMPLETING ALL OF THE BOOK AND PROJECTS THAT WE NOW INVESTED THAT INCLUDE HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN LA- FOR THE- I'LL UNION STATION AND PROGRES CROSSINGS AND IN THE BAY AREA ELECTRIFICATION OF CALTRAIN. I INTEGRATE CROSSING IN THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY- WE ARE. WE ARE MOVING WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT AND WE AND WE ASK FOR A SIDE BY SIDE STUDY ON THE INCREMENTAL AMOUNT WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO ADDRESS THAT TO GET MEANINGFUL BENEFIT FROM A RIDERSHIP OF PERSPECTIVE M. WHAT THAT SIDE BY SIDE CONCLUDED WAS THAT EXTENDED USING THOSE INCREMENTAL FUNDS TO EXTEND TO BE ON THE ONE NINETEEN TO THE CITIES OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY MERCED BAKER'S. GOT US THE MOST RIDERSHIP BENEFIT FOR THE LIMITED INVESTMENT FUNDS COMPARED TO TRYING TO USE THOSE FUNDS TO DO SEVEN DOLLAR CORRIDR SPECIFIC WORK IN OTHER PLACES WHILE OTHER PLACES HAVE MORE RIDERSHIP THEY ALSO HAVE THE I THINK ROBUST TRANSIT OPERATIONS AND THE INCREMENTAL BENEFIT OF OUR MONEY IN THOSE DIDN'T PRODUCE AS MUCH BENEFIT AS WELL AS WHAT WE CAN PRODUCE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BECAUSE THERE'S NOT MUCH THERE NOW AND SO THAT'S WHAT THE SIDE BY SIDE ANALYSIS SHOWED IT ALSO SHOWS. TO GET TOTAL BENEFITS. OF WHAT ONE NEEDED ON THE- CORRIDORS IN THIS IN THE BAY AREA. THE MATCH REQUIREMENT FOR OTHER FUNDS TO COME INTO OUR- DELIVER. UP ADDITIONAL- OPERATIONAL BENEFITS WAS MUCH HIGHER THAN WHAT WE SAW. IN THE BALLOT IN SO. WITH THAT CONCLUSION AND THAT WAS A STUDY WE PUBLISHED I THINK IN NINETEEN ORIGINALLY AND TALKED A LOT ABOUT IT TWENTY TWENTY. TWENTY BUT WE TALKED ABOUT AN AWFUL LOT OF OUR BOARD WE TALKED ABOUT OF THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR. LAST SIX MONTHS WE SUBJECTED THAT STUDY TO ADDITIONAL REVIEW SO IN THAT STUDY WE LOOKED AT ALTERNATIVES. WE GOT ADVICE ON THE BEST WAY TO GO WITH THE LIMITED FUNDS WE HAD AND THAT CONCLUSION WAS GETTING OPERATIONAL SEGMENT GOING BETWEEN THE CITIES OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY GIVEN. THAT YOU'RE SPENDING BILLIONS ON ASSETS THERE TODAY AND SO THAT IS WHAT THE RECOMMENDATION WE MADE TO OUR BOARD THE RECOMMENDATION WE ARE MAKING TO THIS BODY AND YOUR LIGHT OF THE REVIEW THAT WAS DONE. IN RECENT MONTHS IT'S STILL THE RECOMMENDATION. THAT WE ARE MAKING THAT SET. LOOK WE ARE FOR. BACK INVESTMENTS IN CLEAN TRANSPORTATION UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND WE KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF REVENUE OPTIONS TO DO THAT SB ONE. WAS ONE NEW FEDERAL MONEY WILL BE ANOTHER- THERE'S OUT. OF OPTIONS AND A LOT OF FUNDING REVENUE THAT'S GOING INTO PROJECTS THAT WE DO NOT GET. IN SO- WE THINK THIS IS THE BEST USED TO GET OURS GOING WE THINK. IT'S GOOD TO FIND OTHER PROJECTS WITH A BROADER SENSE OF RESOURCES THAT WE CAN EXPAND ALL CLEAN TRANSPORTATION ITEMS THE OPTIONS. BUT IN THE STATE I GUESS THE LAST THING I WOULD JUST SAY IT'S I THINK A RISK. THAT SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON AS WELL IF YOU JUST. WANT TO DO THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES- ED AND NOT ALLOW US TO CONSIDER HOW TO USE THE REMAINING OF OUR BUDGET TO GET MORE OPERATING BENEFIT. YOU WILL SPEND SOMEWHERE IN THE AREA BETWEEN FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. TO BUILD A HUNDRED NINETY MILE TRACK. CONTINUE TO RUN DIESEL SERVICES ON THAT. SCORE GO EIGHTEEN TRIPS A DAY LEAVE IT BACK TO SEVEN OR EIGHT. OF THEM CONTINUE TO SHARE FREIGHT CORRIDORS. GET INTO MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD. AND NOT SEE A SIZEABLE INCREASE IN RIDERSHIP IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND WE THINK THERE'S A BETTER WAY. WE THINK EXPANDING BEYOND THAT. WHAT TOWARD WHAT OUR BUDGET LIMITATIONS ARE. CAN GET BETTER BENEFIT IN ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED TRAINS GOING. IN CALIFORNIA SOONER. THAT WE THINK. THE EXPENDITURE OF OUR ADDITIONAL BUDGET DOLLARS. IS WORTH WHILE TO ACHIEVE THAT. BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU'RE SPENDING FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS AND HAVE NOT ACHIEVED MUCH. AND WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. AND SO FOR US THAT'S A PERSPECTIVE DIFFERENCE AND THAT'S A CHANGE DIFFERENCE I. JUST WANT TO REPEAT SOMETHING I SAID EARLIER THERE'S NO QUESTION. THAT WE NEED TO DO THIS METHODICALLY. THAT YOU NEED MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW IT WILL WORK AS DO WE- AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN COMMENCE THE ANALYSIS THE WORK WE NEED. TO CONTINUE TO BRING THIS BACK WE ARE NOT ASKING. THE LEGISLATURE TO GIVE US ALL TWENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS TODAY WE'RE ASKING. FOR THE BOND DOLLARS THAT ARE DEDICATED TO THIS PROJECT TO COMPLETE OUR CONSTRUCTION. ON THE HUNDRED NINETEEN WHEREAS WHICH WOULD VANCE. UP SOME WORK. OUT OF SO THAT WE CAN- MAP RIGHT AWAY GET COST REFINEMENT DONE FOR MERCED. THE BAKERSFIELD. AND WE'RE ASK TO. LATE TRACKING VALUE THE MOST YOU CAN AND EFFICIENT WAY TO. THAT THIS MAY OUR OP OBJECTIVES- JANET WELL WE DO THINK THAT SHOULD BE ELECTRIFY. I BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO MOVE TOWARD THAT FUTURE IN CALIFORNIA. SO I MEAN THT'S WHERE WE ARE THAT'S THE COMPARISON WE'VE DONE. AND THAT WE KNOW THERE'S MORE WORK TO DO. THANK YOU. NEXT UP WE HAVE MISTER SMITH FOLLOWED BY MR FONG AND THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVIES. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN OF MY QUESTION IS FOR MR CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. AND YOUR BUSINESS PLAN YOU SAY THAT YOU ONLY NEED THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. TO COVER ALL THE FUTURE COST INCREASES FOR THE EXISTING A HUNDRED NINETY MILES. WHAT IS THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE CHANGE ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BY THE CONTRACTORS. THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE AUTHORITY. BUT HAVE NOT BEEN PROCESSED YET. IS A GREATER THAN THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION. IS A GREATER THAN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. OR IS IT CLOSE TO A BILLION DOLLARS IN OVER COST. THANK YOU. WELL A COUPLE THINGS WE ARE WE VALUE WAIT CHANGE ORDERS AS THEY COME IN SO I DON'T HAVE A NUMBER FOR YOU ON HOW MUCH OF COMING AND WE'RE WE ARE PLACING THAT VALUE RIGHT NOW I WILL TELL YOU THAT OUR ESTIMATE AT THE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION THAT WE PUT IN THE BILL IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. LOCAL AN ESTIMATE OF WORK A CHANGE ORDERS THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO EXECUTE THAT ARE ABOVE OUR ADOPTED BUDGET TO DATE AND WHAT PARTS OF OUR DOCTORS BUDGET MIGHT BE AVAILABLE FOR THOSE CHANGE ORDERS SO THAT'S WHY WE CALL THAT THE KNOWN COSTS INCREASE IN ADDITION WE ARE ADVOCATING PUTTING A BILLION DOLLARS IN A RISK CONTINGENCY BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY'LL STILL HAVE TO BE COMMERCIALLY NEGOTIATED. WHICH MEANS WHILE WE PUT OUT AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE COST WE ALSO KNOW WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH A COMMERCIAL CONVERSATION IN SETTLEMENT ON SOME OF THOSE THINGS THAT MUST GET DONE TO COMPLETE THE WORK AND I DON'T HAVE A NUMBER FOR YOU TO EXACTLY WHERE THAT WILL GO BUT WE HAVE A WE ARE PROPOSING TO ADOPT THE BUDGET THAT WILL HANDLE. THE THREE THIRTY AND ANYTHING ABOUT THAT THE OTHER THING ABOUT THE RISK CONTINGENCY IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST DESIGNED FOR THIS CHANGE ORDERS BUT OTHER RISKS IN LIFE LIKE WE ARE GOING THROUGH WITH THE COVERT NINETEEN EXPERIENCE I SAID IN MY PRESENTATION THAT IT DID AFFECT OUR- OUR TIMELINES IT HAS AFFECTED OUR SCHEDULE WHENEVER YOU AFFECTS. SCHEDULE WITH THAT MONEY. AND WANT TO BE MINDFUL THAT ONE OF THE- ABOUT THAT. AND SO AGAIN NOT ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL MONEY FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO HANDLE THIS. BUT USING OUR CURRENT BUDGET. TO ADOPT A BROADER BASE LINE THAT THAT ACCOUNTS FOR MORE RESEARCH. AND COVERS WHAT WE KNOW OUR COSTS THAT WILL COME. TO A COMPLETE THE WORK IN ABOUT. SO THE ONE POINT THREE TOTAL IS DESIGN- TO BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER ALL OF THOSE THINGS. AND COMPLETE OUR WORK. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- MY QUESTION IS TO THE L. A. L- IT IS CERTAINLY HAVE VERY CLEAR THAT THERE IS A BIPARTISAN CONCERN OF THE INADEQUACY OF THE FUNDING- MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY HIGHLIGHTED A POTENTIAL ONE BILLION DOLLAR GAP- IN THE FIRST SEGMENT- THE AUTHORITY DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE PRESENTED A CREDIBLE PLAN TO FILL THE SIXTY TO EIGHTY. MILLION DOLLAR GAP FOR THE WHOLE PROJECT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND ASK YOU TO GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL- ON PAGE SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN OF YOUR ANALYSIS OF THE PLAN YOU ARE YOU HIGHLIGHT. NEAR TERM CHALLENGES AND LONG TERM FUNDING CHALLENGES- SPECIFICALLY- ACTUAL COSTS FOR THE MERCED BIG SHOW SEGMENT TO BE HIRED ANTICIPATED UNCLEAR EXPECT FUNDING- FORMER SAID THE BIGGEST FAILED TO MATERIALIZE AND CLEAR TIMING AS FUNDING- THAT WOULD ALIGN WITH THE PROJECT NEEDS TO AND THEN- I SPECIFICALLY ACTUAL PROJECT COSTS BEING HIGHER THAN CURRENT ESTIMATES EACH YEAR. OR YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES WROTE- IF H. S. R. A. APPLY THIS REVISED APPROACH TO THE FULL PHASE ONE OF THE PROJECT WOULD EXPECT THAT THE ESTIMATED BASELINE BUDGET WOULD BE HIGHER. THAN THE CURRENT EIGHTY POINT THREE BILLION ESTIMATE POTENTIALLY BY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THERE'S NO FUNDING PLAN BEYOND MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD AND YOU CONCLUDE BY SAYING IF PROJECT COSTS ARE ALSO HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED THIS FUNDING GAP WOULD BE EVEN GREATER. SO COULD YOU GO INTO SOME MORE SPECIFICS ON TERMS OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT. THE FUNDING AND WHY THERE ARE THESE NEAR TERM FUNDING CHALLENGES AS WELL AS THE CONCERNS AS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF. VALUE WAITING IN THE LONG TERM FUNDING CHALLENGES. SURE THANK YOU- I THINK YOU'RE REFERENCING SO OF THE WORKING WE DID WHAT. YEAR A VALUE THAT PREVIOUS DRAFT OF THE TWO TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN THAT WAS IN THE LAST YEAR. I IN THAT- ANALYSIS WE RAISED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT POTENTIAL ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION REGARDING WITH THE SCHEDULE AS WELL AS WITH REGARD TO THAT COST AND FUNDING AVAILABLE. I'M AND I THINK IN THIS CONVERSATION TODAY WE FOCUS A LOT JUST ON THIS MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD IS THERE GONNA BE ENOUGH MONEY FOR CENTER BAKERSFIELD- AND AGAIN IT'S AS I MENTIONED- THERE'S NOT CERTAINTY THAT THERE WILL BE THERE. BUT I THINK EVEN BEYOND THAT THERE'S CERTAINLY A FUNDING GAP IF YOU WANT TO GO BEYOND PERCENT TO BAKERSFIELD. ON TO COMPLETE NINE BALLY AND THEN AGAIN TO COMPLETE PHASE ONE SO THAT THE EIGHTY POINT THREE BILLION THAT YOU WERE REFERENCING WITH THE NUMBER- LAST YEAR. AND THAT WAS RELATED TO YOU KNOW THE ESTIMATE THAT TIME FOR COMPLETING PHASE ONE BUT THAT ESTIMATE REALLY DIDN'T EVALUATE FULLY RE EVALUATE THE COST OF THE ENTIRE. OF THE ENTIRE FEES ONE SO WE THINK. YOU KNOW IF THE AUTHORITY. DO WE ABOUT. CHRISTOPHER THE GROUND THAT WHAT THAT COST BE IT WOULD LIKELY SEEING. HOW THAN AND I KNOW IT FOR THINGS LIKE. YOU KNOW THIS- THAT ASSUMING THAT NOW REALLY IS A SCHEDULE THAT. WERE PLANNED ON FULL FINDING OF THE ENTIRE PHASE ONE WHICH- WHICH- IS NOT IS NOT THE CASE SO- AND AS- BRAND HI CAL REFEREE. YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE DELAY THAT TRANSLATES INTO INCREASED COSTS USUALLY IN CONSTRUCTION WORLD. SO CERTAINLY WE THINK THOSE COSTS WOULD LIKELY BE HIGHER IF THEY WERE IF THE WHOLE PROJECT COST WITHOUT WERE REEVALUATED. AND THERE WOULD BE A FUNDING GAP TO DO PHASE ONE- CERTAINLY IN THE IN THE TENS OF BILLIONS IF NOT MORE SO- THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING GOT TO DO THAT- THAT'S- REALLY. YOU KNOW I THINK I CRITICAL QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IS. YES WELL AS THE CONNECTED FINDING AGAIN NOT JUST RESET THE BAKERSFIELD IF THE FUNDING DOESN'T MATERIALIZE FOR THAT THERE COULD BE. A GAP THERE AND THE MILLIONS FOR EXAMPLE BYE. BYE BUT FOR COMMUTING TO FINDING VALUE VALLEY AND EVENTUALLY PHASE WINE AND IN THAT CASE THERE'S AND THERE'S A MUCH LARGER FUNDING GAP AND THAT'S- PROBABLY UNLIKELY TO BE FULLY FILLED BY BY FEDERAL DOLLARS ON. AND SO THERE PROBABLY WOULD NEED TO BE ADDITIONAL STATE DOLLARS AND SO I THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANNA CONSIDER. ITS TOLERANCE FOR COMMITTING ADDITIONAL DOLLARS TO THAT- SO I DON'T KNOW. IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WERE INTERESTED IN THERE BUT BUT THAT WAS. THAT WAS RETURNED TO OUR. MAIN POINTS. AT THAT TIME. THANK YOU- WE HAVE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID FOLLOWED BY MEMBERS LIAM CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WHEN LOOKING AT THE TWENTY TWENTY COLVIN IMPACT TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL I'M LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT ITEMS% YOU HAVE MY QUESTION IS WITH CODE WE- WE- SAW THAT WE HAD A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE COMMUTERS. WERE STAYING AT HOME TO WORKING WAS THAT TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN REGARDS TO THE REVENUE- ON RIDERSHIP GOING FORWARD SINCE A LOT OF THESE OF WORKFORCE WILL BE STAYING AT HOME AND WILL NOT BE TAKING THE TRAIN. THANK YOU. OPERATIONAL SEGMENT DOESN'T BEGIN UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY NINE TWENTY THIRTY FISCAL YEAR- AND WE CERTAINLY HOPE WILL PASS THE- CALL THE IMPACT OF THAT I THINK. EVERY SURVEY I'VE SEEN ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER. THERE'S AN EXPECTATION AFTER VACCINES ARE FULLY KICKED IN AND- WE'RE BEYOND THIS- THIS CALL WITH. A PERIOD. THAT THAT THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT RIDERSHIP WILL RETURN. TO TRANSIT OPERATIONS- GOING FORWARD INSTANCE ARE OPERATING TIMELINE IS BUT SO FAR OUT I DON'T. WE DON'T FEEL LIKE THERE'S- MUCH TO CHANGE IN TERMS OF THE RIDERSHIP ESTIMATES BECAUSE POINT BUT IT'S SOMETHING TO MONITOR AND CONTINUE TO. UP SEE WHAT HOW THINGS COME BACK FROM COVERED AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- BUT NINE YEARS OUT FROM TODAY SO WHAT BY THAT TIME WE CERTAINLY THINK. THAT THERE WILL BE- A FULL SORT OF RECOVERY FROM THIS. PARTICULAR PANDEMIC IN THAT RIDERSHIP WILL LIKELY RETURN. CLICK ON THAT PLEASE- I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WITH THE WORK FOR STAYING AT HOME THIS IS JUST A NEW WAY OF WORKING IT'S NOT SO MUCH OF THE VACCINATION IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND SO THAT REALLY IS MY QUESTION THAT I THINK A LOT OF- A LOT OF US ARE GOING TO STAY AT HOME WORK AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO NEED THIS TYPE OF TRANSPORTATION- SO. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED IN AND YOU'RE TALKING THAT THEY REALLY WANT TO BE INTO CONSIDERATION- FOR ABOUT NINE YEARS SO- I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AT THE CONCERT CHAIR I JUST WANNA I HAVE A QUESTION FOR PEER REVIEW GROUP SPEAKER BUT JUST WANTED TO REITERATE ALSO MY CONTACTS MY QUESTION IS THAT I AM A STRONG SUPPORTER OF HIGH SPEED RAIL IN FACT YOU KNOW ALMOST TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO MY ANCESTORS PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE ME CAME TO AMERICA TO BUILD A RAILROAD THAT TRANSFORM THE COUNTRY A RAILROAD SYSTEM THAT WE LARGELY STILL RELY ON TODAY WITH ARE VERY SLOW DIESEL POWERED. TRAINS AND WE STATE POWER ALONG A SO MY QUESTION TO ENSURE THAT THIS VISION IS ACTUALIZED AND CONTINUES TO BE A HALLMARK OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE FOR HOPEFULLY CENTURIES THE CALM IS- IN IN YOUR PRESENTATION YOU TALKED ABOUT PROPOSING SUSTAINABLE FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT COULD YOU ELABORATE ON SOME OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT SUSTAINABLE FUNDING OPTIONS. TO KEEP OUR THIS PROJECT GOING. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION HONESTLY BECAUSE I THINK IT MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION SOMEONE HAS ASKED ALL. THE PROBLEM THAT THE PROJECT HAS HAD FROM THE BEGINNING INSTEAD IT IS NOT AN ACT OF THE LEGISLATURE AND IT IS NOT A PROGRAM OF THE GOVERNOR AND HELP WAS ESTABLISHED. IN A PROPOSITION ALL AND THAT PROPOSITION DID NOT ESTABLISH AN ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT IN FACT IT WAS. NEVER FUNDED ALL FULLY. AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THE PROJECT HAS STRUGGLED EVER SINCE WITH THE ISSUE OF WHAT CAN WE PAY FOR AND WHAT CAN WE BUILT. AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN EVERY BUSINESS PLAN IS THAT THE SCOPE HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM ONE PLAN TO THE NEXT PARTLY BECAUSE COSTS ARE GOING UP IN PART BECAUSE- IT HAS BECOME THEY THE SOURCES THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO MATERIALIZE DID NOT. AND AS WE I SAID IN OUR STATEMENT WE'VE SAID IN OUR LETTERS BEFORE. THIS PROJECT CAN NEVER BE MANAGED ADEQUATELY AND STABLY WITHOUT ADEQUATE AND STABLE FUNDING. TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE- WE STARTED ON THIS PROJECT IN THE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT OR SO IN THAT SAME PERIOD OF TIME THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS BUILT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND MILES OF HIGH SPEED RAIL. NOW I'M NOT ARGUING WE SHOULD ADOPT THEIR APPROACH BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT. THAT WITH ADEQUATE FUNDING. RESOURCES AND ADEQUATE PLANNING AND ADEQUATE LOCATION. THINGS CAN GET DONE. ALL I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY OF THOSE AND- YEAH I DON'T THINK WE HAVE AN AGREED VISION BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR ASKED WHAT SHOULD ULTIMATELY GET DONE. AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE A STABLE AND ADEQUATE FUNDING PLAN TO GET THAT DONE. ALL UP THERE ARE PLENTY OF WAYS THAT THE STATE SHARE COULD BE FINANCED IF WE WANTED TO THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT THAT DIFFICULT WE DISCUSSED THIS BEFORE- EDITIONS TO THE GAS TAX SUGAR TAX ADDITIONS TO VARIOUS VEHICLE TAXES OF ONE KIND OR THE OTHER. THERE ARE PLENTY OF WAYS. COULD BE FINANCED IF THE VISION IS AGREED AND IF IT IS ADOPTED. SO I CAME INTO THE KEY ISSUE BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE WHAT WE WANT TO DO. AND WHAT ARE WE WILLING TO PAY FOR. A AND I THINK- YOU HANDLE AS WE SAID THE CHANCE BECAUSE THE A PROJECT- IS IN A KIND OF A CONSOLIDATION POSITION RIGHT NOW. YOU HAVE A CHANCE THE WITH THE NEXT SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR TO SEE WHAT THE PICTURE OF FEDERAL FUNDING WILL BE. MORE OF A CHANCE TO SEE MUCH BETTER WHAT THE COST OF THE LINKS AND THEN EVENTUALLY THE COMPLETION OF THE SYSTEM WILL BE. AND YOU HAVE A CHEN TO SPEAK TO SEE THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE PROPOSAL FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM. TO BE OPERATED YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE THAT JAIL. M. M. IN A RECOMMENDATION IS THIS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO FOCUS ON THAT. BUT WE DO WANT YOU TO BE AWARE THAT IT IS THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANCE OF THAT NEW MONEY OF SOME KIND WILL BE REQUIRED EVEN TO COMPLETE THE OF BAKERSFIELD TO UP PERCENT SELECTION. AND AS OF THE L. A. O. PERSON HELEN KIRSTEN SAID IT CERTAINLY WILL BE REQUIRED IN ORDER. TO GO OUTSIDE THAT AREA. THANK YOU ARE A APPARENTLY OUR LAST SPEAKER OUR LAST QUESTIONER- ROUND ONE IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM IF ANY OF YOU WHO HAVE NOT ASK QUESTIONS WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED TO THE LIST LET ME KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY QUESTION FOR MR KELLY. I LOOK THROUGH THE DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN AND SOME OF THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN IT. AND I DON'T SEE ANY- ANYTHING ALLOCATING FUNDS TO LITIGATION OR LITIGATION RISK WHICH IS CURIOUS TO ME. BECAUSE IT OCCURS TO ME THAT. THERE MAYBE MAYBE THERE ARE THERE COULD BE LAWSUITS BROUGHT AGAINST THIS PROJECT- MAKING THE ARGUMENT THAT BECAUSE THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THE PROJECT HAS BEEN CHANGED MATERIALLY. FROM WHAT THE VOTERS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN THE PROP ONE A BOND- PROP ONE INITIATIVE TO AUTHORIZE THE BONDS. THAT ARE CHANGING THE SCOPE OF THIS TO BAKERSFIELD TO MERCED- D. ELECTRIFYING IT. MAKING IT SINGLE TRACK AT CETERA- DOES NOT. COMPORT WITH THE WILL OF THE VOTERS WHEN THEY PASSED THE ORIGINAL BOND WHEN THEY WERE TOLD. BY THE WAY THAT THIS WOULD BE A CONNECTING TRAIN BETWEEN THE BAY AREA AND LOS ANGELES. WHICH IS NOT. AND THAT IT WOULD. MAKE THAT TRIP IN TWO AND A HALF HOURS OR LESS WHICH IT WON'T. SO I'VE ASKED THIS BEFORE MISTER KELLY AND I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN GIVE US AN UPDATE AS TO WHY THERE'S NO LITIGATION RISK IN YOUR BUSINESS PLAN. AND THE STATUS OF ANY LAWSUITS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT ARGUING THAT. AND WHETHER YOU FORESEE THAT BEING A PROBLEM AS THE SCOPE OF THIS PROJECT HAS MATERIALLY CHANGED THANK YOU. I THINK THERE'S SEVERAL ANSWERS TO THAT THE FIRST IS- WE DO IDENTIFYING THE RISKS OF SECTION LITIGATION AS A- REST FOR THIS PROJECT WE HAVE HAD LITIGATION. OVER ALL ELEMENTS OF THIS PROJECT FROM. OF BILLS THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED TO ALLOW US TO DO EARLY INVESTMENTS LIKE IN THE CALTRAIN. CORRIDOR THAT WERE LITIGATED- WE WANT EARLY COURT DECISIONS ON THOSE I BELIEVE THE- THAT'S STILL ON THE BALLOT- IT TODAY- WE- HAVE SETTLED. ALL KINDS OF LITIGATION THE VALLEY'S BROWNING OF OUR MIDDLE DOCUMENTS AND- WE WANT PREVIOUS CASES. ON HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH SPENDING BOND DOLLARS OR OTHER FUNDS DEDICATED TO THIS PROJECT TO BUILD WHAT WE'RE BUILDING. OUT SO. YES LITIGATION IS ALWAYS A RISK ON THIS PROJECT IT HAS BEEN SINCE DAY ONE. I IT HAS COST THE SCHEDULED TIME AND MONEY- AND WE HAVE- EITHER SETTLED OR- THEN VICTORIOUS ON VIRTUALLY ALL LITIGATION. UP TO THIS POINT- AND SO THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE STAND ON LITIGATION I GUESS I WOULD DISPUTE. THE CHARACTERIZATION THAT SAYS WE'RE GETTING AWAY. FROM PROP ONE NAY. I THINK IT. IS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE WHAT WE ARE DOING. IS RECOGNIZING. AS WAS THE CASE THAT THEY THE BOND BILL WAS APPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUILD THE ENTIRETY. OF PHASE ONE. SO WE COME FORTH WITH PLANS ON HOW WE GET THERE INCREMENTALLY. THE ULTIMATE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM WILL MEET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FACE. OF THE PROP ONE A SYSTEM. AND WE ARE NOT THE ONES ADVOCATING TO GET AWAY FROM ELECTRIFICATION. ON THE CONTRARY WE'RE THE ONES PUSHING. FOR ELECTRIFICATION. ELECTRIFICATION IS THE ONLY WAY YOU GET HIGH SPEED RAIL. ANYWHERE WITHOUT IT DON'T HAVE HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND SO WE ARE PUSHING FOR THAT. WE HAVE. TO LAY OUT A VISION BECAUSE J. WHAT LOU THOMPSON JUST TALK ABOUT. BECAUSE NEVER BEEN A IS NOT A STATE SOURCE FUNDING THE- AND BUILD ALL OF THE PHASE ONE SYSTEM. WE LAY OUT HOW WE WILL GET THERE WITH WHAT WE HAVE. AND WHAT WE PUT IN THIS BUSINESS PLAN IS ELECTRIFIED HI SPEED SYSTEM. BETWEEN MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD AS THE FIRST BUILDING BLOCK. THE COMPLETION OF ALL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS FROM LA TO SAN FRANCISCO AND ANNA- THAT WOULD LAY OUT THE PATH IF THE TRACK. OPERATIONAL MODE IN THE DESIGN SHOULD MAKE THE PROP ONE EIGHT REQUIREMENTS AND WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING. TO DELIVER THAT AND WE HAVE NEVER SAID ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT. AND CERTAINLY SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE I'VE PREPARED BEFORE THIS LEGISLATURE MANY TIMES AND I'VE SET. I'M GIVING YOU EXACTLY WHERE OUR CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES ARE ARE JOB IN THESE PLANS IS TO LAY OUT OUR PATH TO DO IT. AND AS LUKE THOMPSON AND L. A. L. HE SAID THE BIG CHALLENGES WE HAVE TO DO IT WITHOUT HAVING SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO BUILD AT ALL. SO WE LAY OUT PROPOSAL OF HOW WE'LL DO IT UNDER A BILDING BLOCK APPROACH. JEFF MORE FEDERAL MONEY COMES IN WE WILL DO MORE AND WE WILL EXTEND FURTHER. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO. WE DON'T KNOW THAT AS OF TODAY SO WE HAVE PUT FORTH A PROPOSAL ON HOW WE CAN GET ONE. I JUST GOING. UP OUT WITH THE FUN THAT WE- A THAT'S WHAT WE LAID OUT. ASSEMBLY AND AS A HAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND THANK YOU TO THE PANEL THAT'S HERE BRIAN I APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION AND- ALSO JUST FOLLOWING UP ON OUR CONVERSATION FROM LAST WEEK I I'D BE INTERESTED AND CURIOUS TO KNOW AND FOR THE RECORD. I AND MOST VERY STRONG SUPPORTER OF THIS PROJECT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN MY ONLY AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW YEARS. MY ONLY FRUSTRATION IS THAT THIS PROJECT STARTED IN CENTRAL VALLEY AND NOT IN- LOS ANGELES CONNECTING TO NORTH LANCASTER PALMDALE WHERE- AS I'VE SAID BEFORE THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND A GREAT DEAL OF NEED. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PROJECT AND I DON'T SEE IT AS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO NECESSARILY THE IMPORTANCE OF IT ISN'T TAKE CONNECT LA TO BAY AREA BUT ITS IMPORTANCE IS THE REGIONAL CONNECTION. IT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE UTILIZING THEIR INDIVIDUAL VEHICLES LESS IN THOSE SHORT SHORT ONE HOUR TWO HOUR INTERVAL DRIVES WHICH THEN BECOMES EVEN LONGER BECAUSE OF THE CONGESTED IMPACT AND THE WEAR AND TEAR ON EVERYTHING ELSE THAT ENSUES BECAUSE OF THAT- SO GETTING OFF OF THE SOAPBOX FOR A MINUTE AND GETTING INTO PRACTICAL NUMBERS AND TO THE QUESTION PLEASE. THANK YOU. HOW MUCH DO YOU ENVISION COMING IN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WHAT THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I MEAN I LIKE TO START WITH GETTING THE BILLION BACK THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TRIED TO TAKE- I'VE WORKED WITH I THINK WE'RE ALL GOING TO SEE MORE- AS THE- CONGRESS MOVES PASSED THE STIMULUS CONVERSATION AND APPEARS TO BE GETTING INTO AN INFRASTRUCTURE CONVERSATION- YOU KNOW WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ENOUGH TO BILL BEYOND THE CENTER ABOUT- WHETHER THAT'S SOUTHWARD TO PALMDALE AND CERTAINLY INTO THE THAT GET THE VALLEY TO VALLEY SYSTEM GOING INTO THE BAYAREA. THAT'S EXPENSIVE AND IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF MONEY BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW BIG EXACTLY THEY'RE PLANNING TO GO I KNOW THEY WERE THERE SEEMS TO BE A REAL PUSH TO BUILD THIS KIND OF STUFF WE DIDN'T ASK FOR A SPECIFIC DOLLAR SIGN BUT WE ARE ASKING FOR A SUBSTANTIAL COMMITMENT WHAT WE WOULD ULTIMATELY LIKE TO SEE HAS. YOU KNOW TO DATE WITH THE FEDERAL MONEY WE HAVE RECEIVED IN THE STATE COMMISSION ON THIS PROJECT THIS IS A FEDERALLY FUNDED PARTNERSHIP PROJECT BUT AS OF TODAY THE STATE IS SPENDING THIS IS ACCOUNTING FOR MORE THAN 80% OF THAT BUDGET AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT BALLOTS FOR AND IF WE IF WE GOT THAT TO MORE TRADITIONAL SORT OF STATE FEDERAL COMMITMENTS THAT WOULD ALMOST REVERSE AND THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO DO AN AWFUL LOT MORE. SO I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC NUMBER THAT WE'RE EXPECTING I JUST DON'T KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD COMMUNICATION ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS ARE UP TO THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE COUNTRY OKAY SO IT IF THE CHURCH DOESN'T MIND ME CONTINUING I KNOW WE NEED TO WORK WITH GOALS AND I THINK I THINK THE LEGISLATURE CAN ALSO BE- OF HELP IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC GOALS THAT WE CAN TARGET SO WHAT IS YOUR WISH LIST WHAT DO YOU THINK WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT. WHAT. IS IT THAT YOU WANT IS. A REALISTIC NUMBER. OF WHAT ARE THE BENCH. AND WHAT IS IT WHAT WE CAN BE PUSHING FOR AND STRIVING FOR. OUR APPROACH THIS AGAIN KEEPING IN MIND I KNOW I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT YOU KNOW. UNFORTUNATE FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THAT STARTED IN THE VALLEY. I DIDN'T MAKE THAT DECISION YOU CAN MAKE THAT DECISION- BUT THAT IS THE PLACE THAT IT STARTED IN SO THE FIRST THING I WOULD SAY IN TERMS OF OUR GOAL IS. WE DON'T INTEND TO LEAVE THE VALLEY WITHOUT HAVING A VALUABLE SYSTEM THERE. SO I WOULD SAY THE FIRST THING IS TO MAKE SURE WE CAN GET AN OPERATING SYSTEM GOING THERE THAT MAKES SENSE SECONDLY. I WOULD. HI I'M BETTING COURAGE BY WORK IN THE BAY AREA AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL REGIONAL MATCHING FUNDS FROM THE BAY AREA TO EXPAND OUR VALLEY SERVICE FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY INTO SILICON VALLEY. WHICH HAS TREMENDOUS RIDERSHIP BENEFITS FOR US SO THAT IS A GOAL AND OBJECTIVE THAT WE WOULD LIKE FEDERAL HELP. IN GETTING TO I THINK THE COMBINATION OF FEDERAL DOLLARS REGIONAL DOLLARS AND- WHAT WE CAN BRING TO THAT CAN BE HELPFUL. AND I THINK OUR FIRST STEP AT LEAST THE FIRST LOOK INTO THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION. IS HOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK OFF OF THE COMPLETION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT ON DEL LATER THIS YEAR AND SEE IF WE I CAN'T START TO WORK ON THE CONNECTING POINT YOU TO THAT POP DOWN. A CORRIDOR AND THERE'S A LAPSE IN AMBITIOUS LIST RIGHT THERE SO WE DO HAVE OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO ASK QUESTIONS- OUR ADJUSTER SAY WE HAVE ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES LEFT- BEFORE WE NEED TO BEGIN OUR SECOND PANEL- MISTER BENNETT IS JUST OUT ON IS A- ASKING HIS FIRST QUESTION. AND UNLESS THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE WANTS TO ASK A QUESTION IN THE FIRST ROUND WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO AROUND TO AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE. ON THE LIST FOR QUESTIONS AND ROUND TWO AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE ABLE TOGET TO ALL THOSE MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF CREDIBILITY IS- FOR THE OVERALL PROJECT. IT IS CERTAINLY HAS BEEN SHAKEN- YOU. HAVE DO YOU WE HAVE THE OF THE TO REALISTICALLY COME UP WITH A CREDIBLE OVERALL NUMBER THAT WE NEED. TO DO THE FULL SCOPE OF THIS PROJECT SO THAT WE COULD TALK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THIS THAT'S WHERE. WE'RE AT I MEAN DO WITH THE ORIGINATED EIGHT OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW BUT THAT OPPORTUNITY COULD BE LOST IF WE DON'T HAVE. SOME CREDIBILITY WITH A CREDIBLE NUMBER DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO COME UP WITH A CREDIBLE NUMBER AFTER WEEK SO. DRAMATICALLY UNDER. ESTIMATED THIS IS A- POLITICS AFTER THANK YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW MY APPROACH SINCE I'VE TAKEN THIS JOB IS TO. NOT TALK ABOUT THE- COST ISSUES IN IN RANGES RIGHT NOW BECAUSE- WE'RE- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS THAT IS THE EARLY STAGE. OF A OF A MASSIVE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT. AND SO- WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO TO REFINE THOSE COSTS TO GET THEM TO GREATER CERTAINTY AND THAT'S WHY. WE ARE RECOMMENDING IN OUR BUSINESS PLAN THAT ONCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK IS DONE. WE IMMEDIATELY ADVANCED DESIGN WORK AND DO. FURTHER NECESSARY WORKS WORKS FINE. BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A CREDIBLE RANGE THAT WE NOW- ARTICULATE IN THE BUSINESS PLAN. FOR SEGMENTS THERE'S A PAGE IN THE BUSINESS PLAN THAT HAS A SEGMENT. BY SEGMENT COST ESTIMATE- TIED TO IT. AND AGAIN IT'S RELATIVELY EARLY BECAUSE WE'RE JUST WORKING THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS AND I'D LIKE TO SEE. DESIGN ADVANCED. BUT CERTAINLY WE KNOW OF A BROAD FEDERAL PROGRAM- THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO. THINK BEYOND THE VALLEY GET INTO THE BAY AREA GETS FURTHER SOUTH. WITH A LONG TERM FEDERAL COMMUNITY COMMITMENT TO ELECTRIFY HIGH SPEED RAIL. BUT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN HELPING US ADVANCE THAT WORKS FINE THOSE COSTS IN. THAT CAN GET THERE BUT WE. DO HAVE IN THE BUSINESS PLAN GET. HE SAID VICE- ACOSTA. AND ARE TO THAT SAME THIS PLAN THAT A BASED COSTS ESTIMATE. FOR THIS SURVEY CERTAINLY ENOUGH TO OUR TICKET TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO GET TO THE AREA WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO GET TO THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BASED. THANK YOU WERE GOING TO MOVE TO ROUND TWO NOW I HAVE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN. PATTERSON AND SMITH. IN THE QUEUE THANK YOU AND I WANT TO ASK A MISTER KELLY TO TRY TO BE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME AND I THINK A LOT OF US HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS TO TRY TO PLEASE BE CONCISE. WITH YOUR ANSWERS. SO FIRST I AM INTERESTED IN THE SINGLE TRACK A PROPOSAL. GIVEN THAT YOUR- THE GOAL ONE OF YOUR GOALS IS TO BUILD RIDERSHIP AND YOUR RIDERSHIP NUMBERS THAT I'VE SEEN ARE BASED ON THE DUAL TRACK SYSTEM WITH A CERTAIN NUMBER OF TRAINS RUNNING SO I'M JUST WONDERING JUST QUICKLY. WITH THE SINGLE TRACK HOW MANY TRAINS SHOULD BE RUNNING HOW THAT AFFECTS YOUR- OF. THE NUMBER OF TREE TO BE RUNNING PER DAY AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE SPEED OF THIS TRAIN SINCE I'M ASSUMING IF IT'S MORE THAN ONE TRAIN. TRAINS HAVE TO PULL OVER AND STOP. AND IF IT'S JUST WONDERING THAT WAS RADICALLY IMPACT THE- THE PROMISE OF WHAT WAS IT FIFTEEN TRIPS ADAY. OR WHATEVER IT WAS HE SAID AND HOW DOES ALL OF THOSE AHEAD OF THOSE OPERATIONAL CHANGES THEN CHANGE THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS. BOB OUR ESTIMATION ON WHAT ON ONE TRACK WE WILL STILL BE ABLE TO MEET EIGHTEEN TRAINS PER DAY- BECAUSE OF THE- OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRACKS. FOR TRAINS TO. KNOW COOPER PASS EACH OTHER AT MAINTENANCE AND- CITING. DISABILITIES WE HAVE A- LOT OF ANALYSIS ON THIS THAT IT. THAT EXPLAINS THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE WITH YOU- IN YOUR OFFICE BUT- THERE IS NO CHANGE IN THE- OUR DAILY TRIPS WE CAN ACHIEVE THAT WITH EITHER ONE OR TWO TRACKS- THERE. IS SOME IMPACT- MINOR IMPACT ON. RIDERSHIP IN THE 2% RANGE SYSTEM WIDE UP FROM FROM ONE TRACK TO MANDATE A MINOR IMPACT ABOUT TWO POINT 2% ON. ESTIMATED REVENUE UP FROM ONE TRACK TO BUT AGAIN WE HAVEN'T MADE A FINAL DECISION ON ONE. THE DIFFERENCE IN THE OF THE SPEED OF THE TRUCK OF THE TRIPS. YEAH THEN AGAIN- TRAINS WILL TRAVEL AT THE MAXIMUM SPEED- IN CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THAT. OF THAT SYSTEM TO BE PARTS OF IT WERE THEY'LL TRAVEL XPW MILES AN HOUR AND THEN THEY'LL SLOW DOWN TO GET INTO. IN THE STATION SO THAT THE SPEED ISSUE IS AGAIN NOT AFFECTED BY THE ONE OR TWO BUT TRACK THAT ISSUE- AFTER STOP AND WAIT FOR A TRAIN TO GO BY. I KNOW THE WAY THAT I THE WAY THAT THE SYSTEMS AND COMMUNICATIONS WILL WORK- THE TRAINS UP MOSTLY HAVE TO SLOW DOWN COMING IN AND OUT OF STATIONS- THERE MAY BE PASSING ELEMENTS WERE TRAINED. WILL WAIT FOR THE ONE TO PASS BEFORE IT PROCEEDS BUT THE WAY WE WORK OUT THE OPERATING ELEMENTS OF THAT AGAIN I CAN SHARE THE ANALYSIS WITH YOU- BUT CHANGE WILL ACTUALLY PROBABLY WANT TO TRAVEL A LITTLE HIGHER SPEED ON THE- SINGLE TRACK OPTION TO MAKE SURE THAT IT CAN MEET THE CONNECTING POINTS. ON BOTH ENDS AND SO. AGAIN I HAVE A FULL ANALYSIS ON THAT WE CAN SHARE WITH YOUR OFFICE BUT AGAIN WE BELIEVE WE CAN MEET THE OPERATING REQUIREMENTS OF THE TWO OR ONE TRACK. JUST FOR THAT INTERIM SECTION AND AGAIN. OTHER OPTIONS INCLUDE BUILDING ADDITIONAL CITING IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DO. AT THIS TIME OUR ANALYSIS IS WE CAN MEET THE OPERATING REQUIREMENTS OF EITHER OF THE TWO TRACK OR SINGLE TRACK SYSTEM. FOR WHAT WE PROMISED NUMBER SET THE BAKERSFIELD STRETCH AND AGAIN I'M HAPPY. TO SHARE OUR ANALYSIS WHICH ARE. MISTER PATTERSON. MISTER KELLY- I HAVE NOTICED SOME MYSTERIOUS ACTIVITY IN THE PUBLIC RECORDS OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. SOME TIME BACK A SPECIAL MATTERS COMMITTEE WAS FORMED IT HAS BEEN MEETING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS ON A WEEKLY BASIS CAN YOU TELL US WHAT THIS SPECIAL MATTERS COMMITTEE IS MEETING ABOUT SO REGULARLY AND IN SECRET- YEAH I MEAN AS YOU PROBABLY ARE AWARE OF BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS JIMMY TO. DISCUSS PERSONNEL MATTERS AND- THAT IS WHAT THEY'RE DOING. BEYOND THAT BECAUSE IT'S A PERSONNEL MATTER I CAN'T COMMENT. HAS THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY RECEIVED A FEDERAL SUBPOENA IN THE PAST YEAR. AFTER A SEPARATE QUESTION ALL- OUR BE WILLING TO BET THAT WILL BE ABLE TO GET TO IT BUT LET'S HEAR FROM MISTER SMITH AND HAS AMASSED CHECK THIS IS A FOLLOW UP. TO HIS HIS ANSWER HE'S SAYING THAT THIS HAS EXECUTIVE IN I'M ASKING HAS THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY RECEIVED A FEDERAL SUBPOENA IN THE LAST YEAR. YEAH I THINK THE ANSWER TO THAT WOULD BE I THINK IT'S SO US THE SIMILAR QUESTION. TEN MONTHS AGO WHEN I APPEAR BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. AND THE ANSWER IS AS I SAID THEN THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE WAS. YEAH VALUE WAITING AT A NOT A SEPARATE PERSONAL MATTER NOT THE SAME ONE TRIED TO. WHAT ARE BORDERS THAT MEETING ON WHY AND I TOLD YOU THEN THAT I THINK THEY WERE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ON THAT AND THEY- HAVE SOUGHT. DOCUMENTS TO WELCOME. TO CONDUCT THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION AND I'LL TELL YOU IN THE TEN MONTHS SINCE WE LAST SPOKE. I HAVE NOT HEARD. A WORD UP DOWN OR SIDEWAYS ABOUT BUT WHERE THAT IS SO I HAVE. NOTHING NEW TO ADD FROM WHAT I. POSTED BY TOO MUCH SO I EXPECTED THAT KIND OF ANSWER SOONER OR LATER SIR YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LET. THE AUTHORITY GOING HAVE TO LET US KNOW AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS SECRET MEETING WEEK AFTER WEEK THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE OUT OF IT. OF COURSE OPEN THIS QUESTION IS AND TRANSPARENCY. MISTER SMITH PLEASE. THIS IS A- YOUR QUESTION PLEASE. ZERO MISTER CHAIR MY QUESTION IS FOR MR THOMPSON ACTUALLY FROM THE PIER VIEW REVIEW COMMITTEE. AND I DON'T KNOW IF WILL GIVE ME A COUPLE SECONDS TO GET UP BUT- IN YOUR EXCITEMENT ALEVE TO AN EXPERT SIR. IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION IS- WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE TO BUILDING A SINGLE TRACK. OTHER THAN CUTTING THE COST. IN THERE DO YOU KNOW OF ANY SINGLE TRACK HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE WORLD. WELL THE ADVANTAGE TO BUILDING THE SINGLE PRACTICE OF PATIENTS THE MONEY REQUIRED TO ADD THE SECOND TRACK OUT IN TIME. HELLO BUT THAT COMES AT THE RISK OF HAVING TO THE TOTAL COST WHEN THEY FINALLY DO IT. BUT AGAIN THIS IS THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF CONSERVING MONEY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE AS MUCH AS THEY WOULD WITH BRITNEY AND IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE SYSTEM. I DON'T KNOW OF ANY ALL HIGH SPEED RAILROADS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD THAT OPERATE ON SINGLE TRACK ALL THOSE THERE'S ALWAYS A RAILROAD EXCEPTION TO EVERYTHING. THAT HAVING BEEN SAID I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE IDEA OF A SINGLE TRACK OPERATION IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT KIND OF SCHEDULE PLANNING SO THAT THE TRAIN STOP IN THE STATIONS ARE AND PASSAGE OTHER AND STATIONS OVER AT OTHER SIGHTINGS. IT COULD WELL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE SCHEDULE THAT THEY CAN OPERATE AND I CAN CERTAINLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE RELIABILITY OF THE SCHEDULED. TO OPERATE. BUT AS A AS AN INTERIM MEASURE ALL AS LONG AS THIS IS PART OF A COMMITMENT TO COMPLETE THE SYSTEM EVENTUALLY. AS A STEP ALONG THE WAY I DON'T HAVE ANY GREAT CONCERN ABOUT THIS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I MISS FRIEDMAN WERE BACK TO YOU THANK YOU THREE MISTER KELLY AGAIN PLEASE BE BRIEF A WHY ARE YOU NOT LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT ARE JUST AS CLEAN. GIVEN THAT WE'RE A FEW YEARS AWAY FROM THE STRAIN. CARRYING PASSENGERS AND CERTAINLY MANY YEARS AWAY FROM THE FULL SYSTEM BEING COMPLETED. SO TECHNOLOGY LIKE FUEL CELL TRAINS AND OR ANY OTHER DEVELOPING INNOVATIONS ISN'T IT A RESPONSIBLE TO NOT CONSIDER EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. AND DO YOU BELIEVETHAT THE VOTERS DIDN'T INTEND FOR EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES TO BE CONSIDERED. BY HIGH SPEED RAIL. THE BOND BILL THAT THE BOND. SORRY THE BOND BILL THAT THE VOTERS APPROVED- HAS PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS IN IT IN TERMS OF TRAVEL TIMES IN SPEECH THAT WE MUST REACH I KNOW OF NO FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY TRAINING THAT CAN MOVE AT THE SPEECH THAT WE ARE REQUIRED UNDER THE BOND BILL TO MOVE. AND THE ONLY TECHNOLOGY THAT I KNOW OF THAT CAN ACHIEVE THAT IS ELECTRIFIED STEEL ON STEEL. GOOD INTO YEARS OUR TIMING SO YOU DON'T THINK THAT TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS FROM NOW THE- FUEL CELL TRAINS THAT NOW OPERATE OF. A LIGHT RAIL FOR INSTANCE THAT AS THEY DEVELOP THOSE AND I KNOW OF SEVERAL THAT ARE IN DEVELOPMENT AROUND THE WORLD YOU KNOW WHO DOES ANY POSSIBILITY THAT THEY WILLBE THE PREFERRED TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN MOVE AS FAST AS ELECTRIFIED TRACK. I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE MOVING IT TWO HUNDRED PLUS MILES PER HOUR BUT THEY MIGHT BE AND WE CAN CONSIDER. THOSE KIND OF OPTIONS I SUPPOSE. IF AND WHEN THAT MATERIALIZE OKAY BUT WHAT I KNOW NOW IS THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE ARE ON NOW IS PROVEN. IT OPERATES AROUND THE WORLD FISSION LEE AND FAST. AND IT CUTS TRAVEL TIMES MAGNIFICENTLY GREAT AND IT IS ALSO. JUST I THINK YOU'VE ANSWERED LET'S LET'S KEEP GOING WITH THE OTHER QUESTIONS- MR FONG HAS MISSILE WILL COME RIGHT BACK TO YOU. BUT A DIFFERENCE OF THE JAGS OF ONE QUESTION AND I'LL- I'LL GIVE MY TIME BACK BY A TO THE L. A. L. IF THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES- THIS FOUR BILLION DOLLAR CORPORATION WHICH WE'RE EXPECTING WILL COME AT SOME POINT WHAT WHAT THE COST OF THE DEBT SERVICE B. I JUST GENERALLY CURIOUS- IF WE CALCULATED THAT. WE HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T DONE A SPECIFIC CALCULATION ON THAT ONLY THE FOUR BILLION BANK OVER TIME USUALLY IN ABOUT DOUBLES THAT I'M NOT TOO KEEN TO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT FUTURE I DOLLARS ARE TYPICALLY SERVE OF THE LAST VALUE THAN. THE CURRENT DOLLARS BUT BUT USUALLY IT'S SORT OF WITHIN THAT RANGE OF COURSE IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING WHEN THOSE BONDS ARE SOLD IN IT BUT WHAT INTEREST RATE. CURRENTLY INTEREST RATES ARE- YOU NEAR HISTORIC LOWS BUT BUT CERTAINLY AND YOU SAID THAT WOULD REDUCE THE COSTS AND LIKE PROBABLY- COMPARED TO THAT BUT IT WOULD DEPEND ON IT IF. ACTUALLY ULTIMATELY WHEN THEY'RE SOLD- WHAT WHAT RATE THE STATE GETS BACK YES THERE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REPAIRING. THOSE- DO YOU THE INTEREST. J. SURVIVE ABOUT- TO SO I BACK- BECAUSE THERE WAS A- USING. COULD BE DONE THAT. USUALLY THAT'S OF THE ROLE OF THUMB HOUSING. ROUGH RULE OF THUMB- IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON THIS OF THIS- AND THE INTEREST RATES ARE AND I HAVEN'T DONE IT I SPECIFIC CALCULATION FOR THAT FOUR POINT. ONE BILLION DOLLARS SO I'M HESITANT TO GIVE A SPECIFIC NUMBER AT THIS POINT OKAY I'VE UP I'LL GIVE MY TIME BY THE CHURCH. THANK YOU ALEJO. I HAVE MS FRIEDMAN- THIS MISS DAVIS HAVE HER. OH I'M SORRY I MISSED YOU- MS DAVIS. THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT. MR KELLY DO YOU THINK THE VOTERS WOULD HAVE APPROVED PROPOSITION ONE A FONT THEY WOULD BEEN TOLD THAT THE INVESTMENT WAS ONLY ENOUGH TO ALMOST BUT NOT TOTALLY COMPLETE A SINGLE TRACK. SLOWER SPEED TRAIN SERVICE WITH MINIMUM STATION CONNECTING TO MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD. I THINK THE VOTERS APPROVED PROP ONE A. TO BUILD IT AND KNOWING BECAUSE THE- GENERAL. ELECTION VOTER PAMPHLET SAID THERE'S NOT ENOUGH YOUR TO BUILD AT ALL. SO I THINK THE VOTERS WOULD HAVE SAID. BOB WOULD HAVE APPROVED US MOVING FORWARD ON ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND LA. AND I IC. RECENT POLLS THAT SUGGEST THEY STILL SUPPORTED AT ROUGHLY THE SAME AMOUNT. OF THE PASSAGE OF THE ORIGINAL BOND BILL. IS FRIEDMAN. THANKS I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHO THIS QUESTION IS FOR- BUT IF CERTAIN PARTS OF THE PROJECTS AREN'T MOVING FORWARD THIS YEAR LIKE THE- TRACKING SYSTEMS CONTRACTED ANY DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT BEYOND THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES. WITH THE APPROPRIATION OF THE ADDITIONAL FOUR POINT ONE BILLION A PROPOSITION ONE A FUNDS NEED TO BE. NEEDED IN THE- TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. TO THE EXTENT THAT DIRECTOR TOWARD ME THE ANSWER IS. YES BECAUSE. WE ADVOCATING THE BILL THE- FOR. TO COMPLETE THE COULD. OF THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES YEAH THE- THE PATIENT WHICH CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS. COMMAND WILL KEEP PACE WITH THAT CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT'S WHAT WE NEED. ARE THE BOND BILL APPROPRIATION TO COMPLETE. THE WORK ON SCHEDULE IN THE CENTER AND WE HAVE ONE MORE MINUTE- MS FRIEDMAN TO HAVE A I DO NOT QUESTIONS AND ACTUALLY I THINK THE NEXT PANEL WON'T HAVE AS MANY QUESTIONS I WOULD APPRECIATE. JUST BEING ABLE TO. ASK THESE. A HOW. WELL I DID HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE NEW OPERATING SUBSIDY REQUIRED BY PROPOSITION ONE ABLE FOR THE L. A. O. BUT- OF ALL SKIP THAT- I'M WONDERING HOW HIGH SPEED RAIL FITS INTO THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER AND SEVENTY NINE DASH TWENTY IN HIS ORDER THAT THE STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY AND OTHERS. CHAU IDENTIFIED NEAR TERM ACTIONS AND INVESTMENT STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE. IT IMPROVE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION EXCEPT FOR A WHILE CONTINUING A FIX IT FIRST APPROACH TO OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM SO HOW DOES FIX IT FIRST FIT IN. WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL. I THINK FICTION FIRST IS CONSISTENT WITH- WELL IF THE TENANTS THAT CAME OUT OF PASSED THE ONE THAT WERE REALLY DRIVEN AT CRITICALLY ON THE ROAD AND HIGHWAY SIDE OF MAKING SURE THAT BRIDGES AND ROADS ARE IN SUCH GOOD CONDITION ASKING. IN A WAY THAT STREETS ROADS HIGHWAYS BRIDGES. ARE VERY SAFE- AND IN GOOD STRUCTURAL CONDITION. I THINK THE OTHER PART OF THAT IS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND REALLY THROUGH AGENCY WHO IS DOING THE WORK TO IMPLEMENT- THE ISSUES AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ARTICULATING THE KIND OF PRIORITIES FOR BROADER CLEAN. I TRANSIT AND CALIFORNIA TOOLS THEY HAVE TO FORWARD THOSE CLEAN TRANSIT OPTIONS IN CALIFORNIA BUT I THINK ASSURING THAT CONNECTIVITY AMONG THOSE OTHER OPERATORS WITH SYSTEMS LIKE HIGH SPEED RAIL- ARE- COME TO FRUITION. AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT THAT'S THE KIND OF THING YOU WILL SEE AS THEY COME FORTY THIRD JULY THANK YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR THOMPSON THE PEER REVIEW GROUP RECOMMENDED THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY EXECUTE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IN THE SAN JOAQUIN. JOINT HERS OF THIRTY BEFORE EXECUTING THE TRACKING SYSTEMS CONTRACT DO YOU BELIEVE THAT MO YOU THAT IT'S BEEN ENTERED. INTO SATISFIES YOUR RECOMMENDATION. WELL I THINK THE- THANK Y. INTERGENDER I THINK THE MO YOU IS A STATEMENT OF INTENTIONS BUT IT IS NOT IN AGREEMENT AND THERE ARE NO COMMITMENTS TO LIVE UP TO THOSE INTENTIONS. BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF THE INTERIM SYSTEM THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL IS PROPOSING. BECAUSE THAT IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ACTIONS OF THE STATE AND THE SAN JOAQUIN JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY AND DAIS- I THINK IT WOULD BE PRUDENT THAT THAT IN MY VIEW BE CONVERTED INTO A MUCH CLEARER SET OF COMMITMENTS OF WHO'S GOING TO DO WHAT AND WHERE THE MONEY IS COMING. FROM THAN WHAT YOU HAVE NOW THEN I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE A LOT MORE CONFIDENCE THAT THE- THAT THE- INTERIM SYSTEM INCLUDING THOSE LINKS COULD BE MANAGED COULD BE COMPLETED AT MADDOX. HAVE YOU EVER GIVEN ANY THOUGHT AS TO WHETHER A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS CALTRANS AT SOME POINT WOULD BE BETTER SUITED TO RUNNING THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. I BELIEVE THE PROPOSAL FROM THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY- IN THE LONG RUN IS TO OPERATE THIS WINTER BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR. ALL RIGHT THE SHORT TERM I THINK THE OF SAN JOAQUIN SERVICES ALREADY BEING PRETTY WELL OPERATED AND- AND EXTENSION OVER THE HIRES PEOPLE INTO SOMETHING THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MANAGE PRETTY WELL. DO YOU BELIEVE IN THIS MY LAST QUESTION FOR YOU THAT THERE'S IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. ABOUT WHEN SOME OF THESE DIFFERENT DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BETWEEN YOU AND HIGH SPEED RAIL AND I'M WONDERING IF I THAT'S A CORRECT TAKE AWAY ON MY- ON MY PART. I DON'T. MEAN BRANDS SHOULD ALSO ANSWER THIS BUT I DON'T SEE THAT THERE'S MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. I THINK WE'RE BOTH SAYING THAT. THAT HAVE THAT THE NECESSARY IMMEDIATE TERM ACTIONS ARE TO COMPLETE THE FEDERAL COMMITMENT FROM THE ERA. OF GRIMMETT THAT SHOULD BE DONE. BUT WE HAVE SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR TO SEE HOW A LOT OF THINGS DEVELOPMENT BEFORE DEVELOP BEFORE COMMITMENTS OUTSIDE THAT AREA WILL BE NECESSARY. SO YOU KNOW TO GO BACK TO THE OTHER ISSUES THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO HEDGE BETS AND SEE HOW THINGS DEVELOP BEFORE. LONGER TERM COMMITMENTS OUTSIDE THE CVS OR RITE I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S WHERE I'M NOT CLEAR WHETHER HIGH SPEED RAIL SHARES THAT OPINION OR NOT. BUT WE COULD BE YOU COULD BE RIGHT. MY LAST QUESTION IS ACTUALLY FOR THE L. A. WHICH IS WHETHER THE L. A. IS CONSIDERED WHAT INVESTMENTS IN SHARED MOBILITY INFRASTRUCTURE THE SHE SHOULD BE MAKING TO REDUCE. THE MOST AMOUNT OF GREENHOUSE GASES. AND TO ADDRESS CONGESTION AND EQUITY ISSUES. AND WHETHER WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE ENOUGH. PICTURE OF THE STATE'S MOBILITY NEEDS. TO I DON'T WE'VE DONE A COUPLE REVIEW OF THAT WOULD- CERTAIN EIGHT WOULD BE A THING GAP AND I EVEN WHAT THE AUTHORITY DID WHICH WAS LOOKING REALLY IT JUST YOU KNOW A FEW DIFFERENT OPTIONS ALONG THE ALIGNMENT WAS WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK AND SO CERTAINLY LOOKING AT ALL THE TRANSPORTATION COST- DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WILL BE WITH YOU A LARGER ENDEAVOR FOR SURE SO- I DON'T THINK WE'VE DONE THAT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO- ESPECIALLY THANK ALL OF OUR PANELISTS MISTER KELLY. MISTER THOMPSON AND MISS CHRISTINE AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO. PANEL NUMBER TWO. RELATING TO INVESTMENTS IN OTHER CORRIDORS ARE. LISTS ON PANEL TO OUR HOUSE ON A CONSTANTLY. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SAN DIEGO ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS STEPHANIE WIGGINS THE CEO OF METROLINK. AND STACEY MORTENSEN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ALTAMONT CORRIDOR EXPRESS. WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU. MISTER A CROWD TO. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIR FRIEDMAN CHEN BROOM COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. HI MY NAME IS HAS SIGNED A CONTRACT ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SANDAG SAN DIEGO ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS. THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED FOR THE FUTURE OF TRANSIT. WITH THE LEADERSHIP WE HAVE IN WASHINGTON DC AND IN IN SACRAMENTO THE MOMENT TO INVEST IN OUR JAIL SYSTEM. AND FINALLY GIVE CALIFORNIA'S THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THEY HAVE ALWAYS DOES HAVE IS NOW. IN SAN DIEGO- WE HAVE EMBARKED ON A MAJOR VISIONING PROCESS REIMAGINING THE FUTURE OF TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM ASSIGNED YET. ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENT TO THIS VISION IS THE CREATION OF A COMPLETE NETWORK OF HIGH SPEED RAIL. SERVICES THAT. TO LAND USE LINKED TO HOUSING CONNECT ME TO GET ADMIN AREAS WITHOUT USING DATA IN WAYS THAT NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE TO MAKE SURE OUR PLANNING. IS DONE THE RIGHT WAY. BONTA IN THE BEGINNING THE FUTURE IS WHAT WE CALL THAT TRANSIT THE- AND THE JEWEL OF THAT IS THE MOST TIME COULD HAVE GONE HIGHLIGHTED THAT READ HERE. THE LAW SANCTITY DOLLAR. IS THE BACKBONE TO THE REGIONAL PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. THE NATION'S SECOND BUSIEST RAIL CORRIDOR IT WAS MORE THAN EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE AND ONE BILLION WORTH OF GOODS EVERY YEAR. WE BELIEVE LOSS ON COULD BE A FEEDER FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM. N. AS MR CALLINAN AND I APPRECIATE HIS PRESENTATION. NOT WHEN WE WHEN I WAS- WITH SKAGGS WE SIGNED AND MORE YOU'LL SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK AT THE POPULATION CENTERS IN THE STATE THE LINCOLN TO HIGH SPEED RAIL. THAT WAS THEN AND I STILL BELIEVE TODAY. ONE GOAL SHOULD BE LINKING THE POPULATION CENTERS FROM SAN LEANDRO THROUGH LA TO SAN FRANCISCO I BELIEVE- AND INVESTMENT IN THE LOSS AND K. DOLLAR WILL REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND MAKE IT CONVENIENT AND BETTER THAN DRIVING ON THE I. FIVE. TO GET THE REGION GREATLY WE HAVE INVESTED THE BILLION DOLLAR THIS CANADA. AND WE HAVE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF PROJECTS THAT ARE SHOVEL READY TODAY. YOU PROBABLY HEAR. THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS THE LAST WEEKEND IS- THE SEA WALL COLLAPSE OF THE PAGE ANOTHER ADVIL MARC LEVINE- FAILURE. WE HAVE THE FUNDING TO TEMPORARILY STABILIZE IT BUT WE NEED TO KNOW MORE REMOTEAPP. SO MY AGENT TODAY TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL LINE LINKING THE TRANSPORTATION CENTERS FROM SAN GENERAL ALL THE WAY TO SAN FRANCISCO. AND LINKING IT TO HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION MY HOPE IS PART OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL- PROGRAM WHICH WE SUPPORT IS DOING THIS IN THESE BOOK ENDS SO BY THE TIME THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. CONSTRUCTION IS COMPLETE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE HAVE A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE BOOKENDS IN CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE PRIMARY. ELEMENT OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AND IN THE BEGINNING BUT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS AND YET WAS WHAT WE CALLED MOBILITY HELP THIS IS WHAT LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION INTERSECT THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO BE SMART ABOUT WHERE WE PUT FUTURE HOUSING AND FUTURE GROWTH. AND FOR THAT REASON INVESTMENT IN HIGH SPEED RAIL IS IMPORTANT THAT ONE EXAMPLE ISWHAT WE'RE DOING IN SAN DIEGO FOR THE SINS FROM ABILITY HELP WHICH WE WOULD HOPE BECOMES ONE MAJOR HIGH SPEED RAIL STATION IN SAN DIEGO- CHAIR FRIEDMAN CHAIR BLOOM THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND I'LL- BE AROUND TO ANSWER QUESTIONS BUT I GUESS WHEN I. I LIKE THE FACT THAT WITH THESE INVESTMENTS WE WOULD ACHIEVE THE SOCIAL EQUITY GOALS FOR CALIFORNIANS BY INCREASING THEIR ACCESS. TO HIGH QUALITY. HIGH SPEED RAIL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY. NEXT WE HAVE THE MS WILLIAMS. GOOD MORNING CHAPEL MANAGED CARE FOR WON'T WORK BECAUSE OF THE ASSEMBLY CHANCE COMMITTEE AND BY STUFF. THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO APPEAR BEFORE TODAY AND STUFF AND WITH OF CALIFORNIA REGIONAL RAIL. ALSO KNOWN AS MUCH. WE'VE BEEN AND I FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS. PEOPLE IN THE SOUTHERN CAL. REGION HOW. JOB HEALTHCARE EDUCATION AND LEISURE TRAVEL DESTINATIONS WELL THE THIRD LARGEST REGIONAL RAIL OPERATOR IN THE COUNTRY AND THE LARGEST IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE A POPULATION OF MORE THAN SIXTEEN MILLION LIVING WITHIN THE- AREA OF OUR SYSTEM. IT FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN WITH FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS NINE MILLION BOARDINGS THE MOBILE NINE POINT THREE BILLION A CAR TRIP FROM OUR CONGESTED ROADS AND REDUCING A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND METRIC. TONS OF G. H. G. THE OF REGIONAL PASSENGER RAIL HAS. SLOWLY IMPORTANT. TOMORROW MARKS ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE THE W. H. O. DECLARED NINETEEN THE GLOBAL HEALTH EMERGENCY. AND SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE STATE HOME ORDERS THAT FOLLOWED WE HAVE BEEN AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE. HEALTHY SOCIAL WORKERS CONTINUE TO GET TO WORK DURING THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC. AND WE HAVE MANAGED TO KEEP OUR PROJECTS ON TIME DURING THIS PERIOD. WE ARE CURRENTLY DELIVERING ON ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN MOSTLY STATE LOCAL INVESTMENT OR TEN BILLION DOLLAR STOCKTON CALIFORNIA OPTIMIZED RAIL EXPANSION PROGRAM ALSO KNOWN AS SCORE. IN FACT WE EXPECT IN FINALLY CLEAR SEVEN GEN AND START FINAL DESIGN ON NINE PROJECTS BY THE END OF THIS MONTH. ALSO WE WILL HOLD GROUNDBREAKING ALL FIVE X. THIS YEAR IN BURBANK ANAHEIM SACRAMENTO CA AND CHESTNUT. THE BY THE MINISTRY BILL BACK BETTER ON INFRASTRUCTURE WE ARE. TO THAT FOR THINKING STATE INVEST. AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS FROM THE STATE TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL SUPPORT SECOND FULLY FUNDS FOR AND MAGNIFY THE BENEFITS OF THE STATE DOLLARS. ALSO WE'RE EXCITED THAT BRIGHTLINE WEST IS LOOKING TO INVEST PRIVATE DOLLARS FOR HIGH SPEED CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NATURALLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND LAS VEGAS. THE STORE PROGRAM GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO NOT ONLY BECOME A WORLD CLASS SERVICE THAT BENEFITS MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE BUT TO ALSO CREATE LASTING GENERATIONAL IMPACTS BUT THE MOST POPULOUS REGION OF THE STATE. WE ALSO SERVE AS A SPONSOR AND AS AN EXTENSION OF THE BACKBONE FOR THE STATE HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE WHEN IT'S READY TO COME TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ADDING TO OUR LOS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION SCORE WILL CREATE MORE THAN A HUNDRED THIRTEEN THOUSAND HIGH PAYING CONSTRUCTION JOBS YOU FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT GAMES. AND MORE OVER THE L. EDC PROJECTS THAT SCORE WILL ELIMINATE THREE POINT FOUR BILLION THE EMPTY AT FIFTY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION METRIC TONNES OF GHG. WHEN I LAST APPEARED BEFORE YOU 52% OF OUR FLEET HAD TIER FOUR LOCOMOTIVES IN SERVICE WHICH REDUCE EMISSIONS BY UP 285% FROM THE EQUIPMENT THEY REPLACE. TODAY 71% YOUR FOR WHAT THE LAST LOCOMOTIVE EXPECTED BY JUNE WE'RE OFF BUT DANCING EIGHT ZERO FOSSEL YOU'LL USE YOUR- BY PILOTING RENEWABLE DIESEL TODAY AND ADVANCING OUR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN. THE FIRST OF ITS KIND FOR AGENCIES. OF VISION TO ACCELERATE OF THE OMISSIONS FUTURE THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL CONSIDER LATER THIS MONTH. WE ARE READY TO ACT NOW FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR LOCAL AND STATE FINANCE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL. MEASURE LIKE IT'S NOT ONLY SHOVEL READY BUT ALSO SOME WORRY. HAVING THE ABILITY TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS OF THE PUBLIC DOLLARS TODAY WELL WHO ARE MADE A REGION AS WELL AS FOR THE STATE HIGH SPEED RAIL WHEN THEY'RE READY. THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR. BEFORE YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND OUR FINAL SPEAKER STACEY MORTENSEN. STACEY HAS TO SHARE HER OWN SALON- SO WE WILL GET THAT GOING. WELL THE STEAM CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY OUR DAILY RADIO PROGRAM IS ON THE MOVE. AND IT IS A COMBINATION OF BOTH ACE AND SAN JOAQUIN AMTRAK SERVICE SHOWN ON THE MAP THERE HEADING NORTH OUT OF MERCED IN THE GREEN AND PURPLE LINE'S TAKES US OFF TO OAKLAND SAN JOSE AND THAT NO THOMAS AREA WHICH IS JUST TO STONE THROWS FROM THAT SACRAMENTO AIRPORT. IF THE STATE WIDE MAPPING HERE SO YOU CAN SEE OUR RELATIONSHIP TO EVERYONE ELSE LOW SAND CAPITOL CORRIDOR HIGH SPEED RAIL SEGMENT. THE VICTORVILLE THE BIGGEST SIGN BUT ALSO THE DASHED LINES SHOW YOU A FAR REACHING THROUGH A VAST NETWORK. THERE ARE USED BY NEARLY HALF OF THE SAN JOAQUIN WRITERS VERY IMPORTANT TO CONNECT PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE OTHER OPTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. MORE IMPORTANTLY THOUGH THIS IS A BLOW UP YOU FOR THAT PASSENGER THIS NEW NETWORK CONNECTS THEM TO CALTRAIN VTA. BART CAPITOL CORRIDOR FUTURE VALLEY LINK SERVICE. HIGH SPEED RAIL SEGMENT SACRAMENTO AIRPORT- IN A VERY INTEGRATED WAY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE MUCH MORE CONNECTED THAN WE KNOW. BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE ROOM WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE THIS CONNECTED NETWORK SEEM LESS FOR THE TRAVELER. RIGHT NOW THE SAN JOAQUIN TRAINS DO RUN FROM BAKERSFIELD BUT THAT WILL GIVE WAY IN THE FUTURE TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE IN OUR PORTION WILL FOCUS ON THIS NETWORK YOU SEE HERE. IT'S A COMBINED PROGRAM FOR ASYNCIO MY CANS AND IN HAND WE HAVE ABOUT ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. IN A MAJOR BOOST TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM IS RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF THE MAP AT THE STOCKTON STATION WHERE THE- GREEN AND PURPLE ALL COME TOGETHER. THIS IS SIMILAR TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S COLTON CROSSING A HUGE BOTTLENECK WHERE BNSF AND UNION PACIFIC CROSSEY VERY DIFFICULT PROJECT TO GIVE ALL THE PLAYERS. AT THE TABLE VERY DIFFICULT PROJECT TO GET FUNDED BUT THROUGH A GOOD PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE RAILROADS THE STATE LOCAL AGENCIES AND THE FEDERAL BILL GRAHAM. WE HAVE THAT PROJECT UNDER WAY AND LOOKING TO CONSTRUCTION IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS THIS UNLOCKS IN STOCKTON. CONSTRAINTS THAT HAVE PLAGUED THE RAILROADS THE COMMUNITY AND THE PASSENGER RAIL SERVICE FOR DECADES. AND WE'VE EXPERIENCED VERY GOOD COOPERATION FROM THE FREIGHT RAILROADS. WE'VE DEVELOPED AGREEMENTS WITH THEM COLLABORATIVELY THAT WILL ALLOW US TO PHASE IN THE PROJECTS YOU SEE HERE IN ABOUT FOUR WAVES THE FIRST THREE WILL BE HAPPENING FROM. IN CONSTRUCTION TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO TWENTY TWENTY SIX. AND EACH OF THE SECTIONS ALL JUST BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT THEY THEY PRETTY MUCH HAVE DOUBLE TRACK SECTIONS CITING BRIDGE WIDENING. AND THEN STATIONS AND LYFT LAYOVER FACILITIES- DEPENDING ON THEIR PARTICULAR LOCATION. OUR WAY EVERYONE IS REALLY GOING SOUTH FROM THE EXISTING ACE TRUNKLINE IN THE LATER BAY AREA RIGHT WHERE THAT LITTLE- SORT OF UPSIDE DOWN TRIANGLE COMES TOGETHER. WEEKS IN TWENTY FIVE MILES SOUTH. OR WAVE TO AND WE'RE GOING TO PIGGY BACK THAT ONE RIGHT ON WAVE ONE WILL EXTEND US NORTH FROM STOCKTON ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN MILES. UP TOWARDS THE SACRAMENTO AIRPORT. AND THEN ARE WE THREE HEADS BACK TO THE- AND TAKES US FOR THE CERES STATION ALL THE WAY DOWN TO MERCED NOW THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL SERVICE WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE LIMITED TRAINS. BUT WAIT FOR COMPLETE ALL THE STATIONS ALTHOUGH CIRCLES YOU SEE ON THE MAP IN THE GREEN AND THE PURPLE. IN ADDITION TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDING NEEDED TO GET US TO SIX TRAINS DIVERS AT THAT WAS OUR PLAN. FOR REALLY DECADES IT BECOME BECAME MORE IMPORTANT AND IN FOCUS FROM THE SCHEDULE STANDPOINT AS HIGH SPEED RAIL. GETS MORE CLEAR ABOUT THEIR SCHEDULE I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY IT THAT OUR PLAN IS HOW ARE WE PROGRESSING ON THE PROGRAM. SO WE GET A PLEA ONE RAILCARS SIX LOCOMOTIVES PRODUCTION FOR THIS EXPANSION. IN A WAVE ONE PROJECT IN THE DESIGN AND ENGINEERING PROCESS IN ABOUT ONE YEAR FROM NOW WE INTEND TO BE IN CONSTRUCTION. WITH NEW SERVICE ON THAT ROUTE BY MID TO LATE TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO REALLY BEFORE WE KNOW IT. WE WILL HAVE TRAINS RUNNING ON THOSE- SECTIONS WAIT TO SAME THING BIG BASS OF THE- CONTRACTS ARE TO BID NOW FOR FINALLY. AND WE EXPECT CONSTRUCTION TO BE ABOUT SIX MONTHS FOLLOWING THE WAVE ONE WITH NEW SERVICE AND LIKE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND THEN OUR FINAL EXPANSION TO MERCED CLOSER STOCKTON DIAMOND THOSE OF THE TWO BIGGER SEGMENTS OF THEPROGRAM. THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE WILL BE IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE DO OF ALL THE INITIAL AGREEMENTS WITH THE RAILROADS WHICH IS THE BIGGEST LEFT. SO NOW WE CAN JUST FOCUS ON THE ENGINEERING AND THE CONSTRUCTION WHICH WOULD BEGIN IN LATE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SO I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A HIGHLIGHT OF THE OF PIECES OF WORK UNDER WAY THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT IN THIS NORTHERN CONNECTION TO HIGH SPEED RAIL IN MERCED AND I THINK YOU FOR THE TIME TO SHARE OUR PROGRAM. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ALL OF OUR SPEAKERS THAT WAS KIND OF A LIGHTNING ROUND- TRANSPORTATION A VISION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND TO- TO THINK THAT- OF THESE PROJECTS COULD BECOME A REALITY SOME DAYS SAID- TRULY AMAZING AND- AND- THAT THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WILL. REALLY- WHO'S CALIFORNIA. DECADES TO COME. DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR OUR ESTEEMED PANELISTS BEGINNING- CHAIR FRIEDMAN I HAVE JUST ACTUALLY THREE QUESTIONS SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE OTHERS WILL FIND OUT WE HAVE ABOUT FORTY MINUTES- FOR QUESTIONS AND TO- WERE KIND OF A- LIGHT IN THE ROOM RIGHT NOW SO WHY DON'T YOU ASK- ALL THREE OF YOUR QUESTIONS AND WE'LL SEE. WE'LL DO OUR BEST TO FIT EVERY EVERYBODY THANK YOU THE FIRST SEASON AS HE SAID IT'S REALLY EXCITING AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL NEED TO REALLY WORK FOR IS GETTING THESE PROJECTS BUILT BECAUSE HUGE HUGE JUST FOR DIFFERENCE EVERYBODY'S LIVES CALIFORNIA. A FIRST FOR MS WIGGINS ARMS I AM WONDERING- LET'S ASSUME THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL HOPEFULLY EVENTUALLY COME DOWN AT LEAST TO THE BURBANK AIRPORT IF NOT BEYOND. WHAT IMPROVEMENTS CAN WE MAKE TO THE METROLINK WHAT IMPROVEMENTS YOU NEED TO MAKE TO THE METROLINK TRACKS TO ALLOW THAT AND WHAT WHAT. BENEFITS WOULD THAT GIVE YOU. EVEN WITHOUT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. IN OTHER WORDS I KNOW WE HAVE TO DO IT BUT BUT DOES DOING IT HEALTHCARE OPERATIONS. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR ACTUALLY MADAM CHAIR SO AS A BOOKEND IDENTIFIED OPERATOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL- I WANT TO FOCUS ON OUR BURBANK TO ANAHEIM CORRIDOR WHERE THERE'S SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS THAT COULD BE MADE TODAY THAT- BENEFITS ARE MAKING REGION AS WELL AS THE STATE OF. BECAUSE OF OUR UNIQUE GEOGRAPHY OUR ABILITY TO- IMPROVE AIRPORT CONNECTIVITY BURBANK AIRPORT AS WELL AS START TRANSIT PARTNERSHIPS IN THE REGION PART OF THE RGION WHETHER IT'S SPORTS COUNTY AS WELL AS L. A. METRO- THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST AND GENERATE ADDITIONAL RIDERSHIP IN THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND BUILD SOME. OF THE EARLY IN THAT. RAIL WAY IT'S- WHEN IT ALTMAN GETS HERE SO WE MIGHT. RENO TO FIVE BILLION THAT'S IT NEEDED BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WITHIN THE QUARTER IT WOULD BE GREAT MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND JOBS. AS WELL AS- THIRTY THREE OF THE PROJECTS THAT COMPRISE. ONE DOLLAR NEED- TOTAL HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE BILLION AND THOSE ARE SHOVEL READY TODAY WHICH GOOD GREAT EIGHTY SEVEN HUNDRED JOBS IN THE OR THE TYPES OF IMPROVEMENTS TRACK A PATH STATION. GREAT CROSSING IMPROVEMENTS RIGHT SEPARATION IMPROVEMENT OF COURSE SOME OF THE ROLLING STOCK. THANK YOU- AND NOW FOR- IS- MORTENSEN- MY QUESTION FOR YOU I HAVE A SIMILAR QUESTION WHICH IS- BERMAN. YOUR. ABOUT BOOZ INVESTMENTS IN THE A SYSTEM THAT YOU WILL NEED TO CONNECTED TO HIGH SPEED RAIL TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT WHAT INVESTMENTS I KNOW YOU DID TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THIS I WONDER IF YOU COULD JUST ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT INVESTMENTS YOU NEED TO CONNECT AND WE'RE AT THIS POINT HE BELIEVE THE FUNDING IS GOING TO COME FROM. SO IT LOOKS LIKE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ONE POINT THREE BILLION OUT OF ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN ONE POINT EIGHT. MILLION DATED WE DON'T HAVE A FULL ESTIMATE. UP WE KNOW HOW TO GET AS TO THE MERCED STATION. DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT WILL BE A GREAT WEATHER WILL BE ELEVATING THAT WILL MATTER ON THIS LAST LITTLE SEGMENT HOW WE TIE INTO IT. THEN ADDITIONALLY THE SAN JOAQUIN'S NEED TO CONNECT FROM THEIR SEPARATE LINE ON THE BNSF ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF. HEART WE WILL NEED TO CLOSE THAT GAP HOLD THE- SAN JOAQUIN TRAINS INTO THAT NEW JOINT HUB IN MERCED. AND SO AGAIN WE CAN HAVE ESTIMATES IT'S PROBABLY CLOSE TO A COUPLE BILLION DOLLARS IF IT'S ELEVATED. AND THEN MUCH LESS SO IF IT'S A GREAT SO WE'REWE'RE IN A BIT OF A WAIT AND SEE PATTERN UNTIL WE- CAN GET SOME OPTIONS FOR ALL OF THE ENGINEERING. THAT MEETS THE MERCED STATION THAT'S ULTIMATELY BUILT AND WHAT IS THE TIMETABLE FOR THAT WHAT IS SORT OF YOU'RE ASSUMING YOU HAVE THE FUNDING. WHEN COULD THAT BE BUILT BECAUSE THEY'RE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS REALLY DEPEND ON BEING ABLE TO CONNECT TO YOUR SYSTEM. AS WELL. WHAT WE WOULD HOPE TO PIGGYBACK THAT ON THE WORK THAT'S GOING ON THAT THAT WAY BEFORE. THAT WILL BE UNDER WAY IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE IN TERMS OF ITS FINAL DESIGN. AND SO WITH THAT THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME TO HELP THAT CONSTRUCTED. BY THE TIME THE HIGH SPEED RAIL IS OUT MERCED. SO WHAT ARE YOU ANTICIPATING IF YOU'RE GONNA THROW A YEAR OUT FOR EVERYTHING BEING DONE TRAINS RUNNING PEOPLE ABLE TO GO FROM BAKERSFIELD AND GO INTO YOUR SYSTEM TO GO TO THE BAY AREA. WE WOULD LIKE TO BE DONE THERE BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY SIX AND TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. AND THAT ALLOWS FOR ANY LAST MINUTE CHANGES THAT MIGHT HAPPEN WITH MERCED AT AS PART OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL TERMINUS BUT LACKS AS HAVE THE BULK OF. OF THE APPROACH RIGHT WE GET RIGHT TO THE APPROACH THE LAST- TANGENT POINT BEFORE WE HAVE TO MOVE OFF TO MEET THAT MERCED CONNECTION SO I DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEM WITH TWENTY TWENTY SIX TO TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. I KNOW MY STEP THAT SHOOTING FOR TWENTY TWENTY SIX BUT THERE ARE SOME EXTERNAL THINGS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THANKS AND LAST QUESTION HIGH SPEED RAILS PROPOSINGTO LEASE THE INTER REAL SERVICE TO THE SAN JOAQUIN JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY. AND THE ALTAMONT CORRIDOR EXPRESS HOW WOULD THIS WORK. SO IT WOULD WORK MUCH LIKE WE'VE LEAST TRACK FROM THE FREIGHT RAILROADS TODAY. WE LEAVE TRACK OF THE SAN JOAQUIN WITH THE BNSF LEAST TRACK FROM THE UNION PACIFIC FOR THE A STRAINS AND WE NEGOTIATE A AN AGREED UPON LEASE PRICE FOR THE USE OF THE SYSTEM THE MAINTENANCE OF THE SYSTEM SOME CAPITAL REPLENISHMENT OF THE SYSTEM. AND SO OUR NATIONAL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY HAVE BASICALLY FOLLOW THAT THAT RECIPE. WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THE ATO'S ESTIMATE RIGHT NOW OF WHAT THOSE COSTS WILL BE. AND AS THEY GO AND SO WE ARE IN DISCUSSION WITH THE AUTHORITY IN THE ETL AS AS MORE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AND ESPECIALLY AS THE- THE EQUIPMENT DECISIONS ARE MADE ABOUT THE- YEAH THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF EQUIPMENT THAT HAVE DIFFERENT MAINTENANCE COSTS DIFFERENT SPEAKS ETCETERA SO. BE PRECISE EQUIPMENT WILL MATTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD HAS A QUESTIONS. GREAT OUT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION HERE TODAY AND- MR CHRONOSPHERE LEADERSHIP DOWN HERE IN SAN DIEGO DEEPLY APPRECIATED THANK YOU FOR SHARING THE VISIONARY WORK THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO RE IMAGINING THE NETWORKS- I WONDERED IF YOU COULD ELABORATE AND EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON ON THE- ESSENTIAL NEED THAT WE HAVE AROUND THE TOWN MORE PLUS- ON THE DIFFERENT- THE TIME LINES AND INVESTMENTS THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO- SECURE A BETTER ALIGNMENT AND THROUGH THE AREA AND I KNOW THERE'S OTHER. DOUBLE TRACKING ISSUES ALONG OUR COASTLINE AS WELL WHAT WOULD THE TIMELINE RESOURCES LOOK LIKE TO REALLY FULLY REALIZED- A- RELIABLE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM THROUGH THE SAN DIEGO REGION. THANK YOU US MEMBER WATER THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND- JUST BRIEFLY. AND AS I INDICATED MY PRESENTATION. THE LOSS AND CANADA IS THE SECOND BUSIEST IN THE COUNTRY. EIGHT MILLION PASSENGERS A YEAR. A LOT OF FREIGHT MOVEMENT. THAT CARRIED OVER HAS SEVERAL CHALLENGES AND ONE OF THEM EIGHT WELL ONE POINT SEVEN MILEAGES ON THE BLUFF. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WE EXPERIENCED IN THE ROUGH COLLAPSES THAT WE HAVE TO IMMEDIATELY PAY ATTENTION TO. EVENTUALLY THAT LIFE HAS TO MOVE A LOT. NOT IN THAT CATEGORY HE ALSO TO BE STATE AND THEN THE MINIMUM CARE. YEAH WE BELIEVE IF WE DO THESE IMPROVEMENTS THIS CABLE CAN GO TO ONE HUNDRED TEN MILES PER HOUR SO I KEPT FROM SENTIMENTAL TO LOS ANGELES UNION STATION WHEN NOT TAKE THREE AND A HALF HOURS BUT WILL TAKE LESS THAN TWO HOURS. AND THAT IS BUT THEN THEN THEDRIVING ON THE I. FIVE. THAT WE HADN'T INVESTED ABOUT THE BILLION DOLLARS IN THIS CASE WE HAVE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS SHOVEL READY PROJECT TO BE INVESTED. AND WE HOPE FOR A FEDERAL STATE LOCAL PARTNERSHIP TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND TO THE GENTLEMAN'S QUESTION IS WHEN CAN WE DO IT. IF WE HAVE THE MONEY WE CAN STOCK RIGHT NOW. AN IMPROVING THIS CHARACTER THAT'S NATIONALLY AND STATE WIDE THEN REGIONALLY SIGNIFICANT AND I BELIEVE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HIGH SPEED RAIL WHEN IT'S BUILT IN THE FUTURE YOU CAN NOT HAVE A HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM THAT'S EFFECTIVE. WITHOUT LINKING. THE POPULATION CENTERS OF THE STATE. THANK YOU FOR SO. THANK THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM AS MEMBER LENA. THANK. THANK YOU SEE SHARE I DEFINITELY APPRECIATE ALSO CHAIR FRIEDMAN QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW ACE WILL BE CONNECTED AND BENEFITING TO THE BAY AREA AND OF COURSE HIGH SPEED RAIL I JUST WANNA DANCE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MORTENSEN THAT IF DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OR METRICS ABOUT HOW THIS CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS IMPROVEMENT OF THE CORRIDOR- WILL IMPACT THE GREATER ECONOMY OF THE BAY AREA I REPRESENT THE REAR FOR OF THE STATIONS ON THE LINE AND KERRY SAID. ABOUT IF THERE'S ANY DATA THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE BEARS ECONOMY. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ALL OF THE STUDIES THAT WE HAVE SEEN THROUGH THE BARE AREAS ECONOMIC GROUPS. REALLY POINTED TO THE FACT THAT ACCESS TO ECONOMIC CENTERS NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE. IN THE VALLEY OR IN THE SUBURBS IS CRITICAL TO THE OVERALL ECONOMY. AND AS WE ALL KNOW THERE'S MEGA REGIONS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND RAIL IS REALLY SHOWN TO BE ONE OF THEM. THE KEYSTONE ELEMENTS TO MAKE THAT SUCCESSFUL ALLOWING FOR SATELLITE OFFICES AND PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO TRAVEL BACK AND FORTH. I WILL KNOW I HAVE TO SAY SHAMELESSLY I COPIED. STEPHANIE WIGGINS OUT REACH TO HER PASSENGERS BECAUSE AS NON WRITERS WE CAN ASK OURSELVES WILL PEOPLE COME BACK TO THE TRAINS. AND I THINK YOU KNOW AROUND THE DINNER TABLE YOU CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS WHERE YOU THINK KNOW THAT PROBABLY WON'T. BUT WHEN YOU ASK THE PASSENGERS THEMSELVES. AS A METROLINK GET IN AS WE HAVE DONE THE PASSENGERS REALLY DO WANT TO COME BACK AND THEY EXPRESS. AN INTENT TO COME BACK EVEN IF THEY ARE GRANTED- MORE TIME TO WORK FROM HOME SO I JUST WANT TO SAY WE SEE THAT. THE OF THE RIVER RECOVERY FROM CO THAT. AS A POSITIVE ASPECT OF OUR PROGRAM OVER A COURSE OF IT A COUPLE YEARS. AND THEN THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT IS CLEAR THAT THE MORE BROADLY WE CAN CONNECT PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH NO OPTIONS. THE MORE WE RAISE. THE WHOLE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. THERE APPEAR TO BE NO MORE QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS AND SO- I WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR PANELISTS FOR YOUR EXCELLENT AND CONCISE. PRESENTATIONS AND WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT AND FOR THAT I WILL TURN THE GAVEL OVER TO MY- CO CHAIR.
