AS YOU HAVE A PRE TRIAL

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.230
DETENTION SYSTEM YOU DON'T HAVE

00:08:17.296 --> 00:08:19.098
TO HAVE BAIL. SO THE PROPOSAL

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:21.267
ULTIMATELY IN SB TEN WHICH THIS

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:22.735
BILL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH AS

00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:25.872
ALL GET TO WAS REPLACING THE

00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:28.040
WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM WITH

00:08:28.107 --> 00:08:29.575
THE BAIL SYSTEM WHICH WORKS

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:31.911
SUPPORTING IN THIS MEASURE WITH

00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:33.713
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SYSTEM

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:35.514
OF ALGORITHMS AND A HUGE

00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:37.183
BUREAUCRATIC INFRASTRUCTURE

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.420
WHICH FORM. THE FOUNDATION OF

00:08:41.487 --> 00:08:42.021
THE OPPOSITION. SO THAT MAKES

00:08:42.088 --> 00:08:43.956
WAS PASSED. AND THE ARGUMENTS

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:48.027
JUST TO MAKE IT CLEAR AS TO WHY-

00:08:48.094 --> 00:08:49.528
THAT WERE MADE WITH RESPECT TO

00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:51.230
THE SEVEN COMPANIES THAT PUT UP

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:52.665
THE MILLION DOLLARS TO PUSH TO

00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:54.300
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEIR BAIL

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.302
INDUSTRY BUSINESS THE SHIRT

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.004
ACCOMPANIES. THE ARGUMENTS

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.205
WARNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE

00:08:59.272 --> 00:09:01.474
SYSTEM IS FAIR AND JUST OR

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.876
EFFECTIVE THE ARGUMENTS WERE

00:09:03.943 --> 00:09:06.012
ABOUT ALGORITHMS THE ARGUMENTS

00:09:06.078 --> 00:09:07.113
THAT WERE MADE THAT THESE

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:09.515
COMPUTER BASED SYSTEMS I'M

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:10.149
READING FROM THE OFFICIAL VOTER

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:12.018
GUIDE. HOW THE GOODS TO MAKE

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:13.519
IMPORTANT CRIMINAL JUSTICE

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:15.187
SYSTEMS COMPUTER MODELS MAY BE

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:16.455
GOOD FOR RECOMMENDING SONGS AND

00:09:16.522 --> 00:09:17.957
MOVIES BUT USING THESE

00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:19.725
PROFILING MESSAGE TO DECIDE WHO

00:09:19.792 --> 00:09:21.460
GETS RELEASED FROM JAIL AND WHO

00:09:21.527 --> 00:09:22.728
GETS A LOAN HAS BEEN PROVEN TO

00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:24.230
HER COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ALICE

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:26.165
HUFFMAN PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA'S

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.600
CONFERENCE OF THE N. DOUBLE ACP

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:29.802
FATHERS CREATE TALKED ABOUT

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:32.672
BUREAUCRACY. NOBODY NOBODY IN

00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:35.308
TRYING TO DEFEAT REFORM OF THE

00:09:35.374 --> 00:09:38.711
BILL SYSTEM SAID THAT THE BILL

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:40.079
SYSTEM WORK. NOBODY SAID THAT

00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:44.917
IT WAS JUST. THEY ALL JUST SAID.

00:09:44.984 --> 00:09:47.920
ALGORITHMS BUREAUCRACY MORE

00:09:47.987 --> 00:09:49.822
SPENDING TAXES THOSE ARE THE

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:53.559
ARGUMENTS AND SO THE ISSUE THAT

00:09:53.626 --> 00:09:55.962
INFORMS THE FIRE BOB MARLEY

00:09:56.028 --> 00:09:57.997
COSTS THAT ARE FIGHTING FOR

00:09:58.064 --> 00:10:00.299
THIS ISSUE IS JUSTICE JUSTICE

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:02.335
MEASURED BY PUBLIC SAFETY BUT

00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:06.072
JUSTICE AND THAT IS NOT WHAT

00:10:06.138 --> 00:10:09.408
HAPPENED IN THE LAST ELECTION.

00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:12.912
SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS BILL

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:14.647
WITH SENATOR SKINNER ASSEMBLY

00:10:14.714 --> 00:10:17.249
MEMBER BONTA DOES NOT RELY ON

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:18.417
THE PROCHE OF WHAT WE'VE TAKEN

00:10:18.484 --> 00:10:21.787
BEFORE IT BASICALLY REPLACES IT

00:10:21.854 --> 00:10:23.556
DOESN'T REPLACE WHICH WAS DONE

00:10:23.622 --> 00:10:24.623
AT THE SUGGESTION OF THE

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:25.591
WORKING GROUP BY THE CHIEF

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:27.927
JUSTICE. BUT IT WORKS ON THE

00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:29.328
EXISTING SYSTEM UNDER OUR

00:10:29.395 --> 00:10:31.564
CONSTITUTION A BAIL AND MAKES

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:35.601
IT BETTER FAIRER MORE JUST. SO

00:10:35.668 --> 00:10:37.870
EACH THE FIRST POINT IS THAT

00:10:37.937 --> 00:10:40.072
THIS BILL IS COMPLETELY IN

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:40.906
LARGE MEASURE ACTION A

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:41.807
COMPLETELY IN LARGE MEASURE

00:10:41.874 --> 00:10:44.710
BASED UPON. THE D. ZERO BAIL

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:46.679
ORDER BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL

00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:47.780
MEANING THAT THE JUDGES SCRUB

00:10:47.847 --> 00:10:49.548
THIS REPORTS THE GALLERY AND%

00:10:49.615 --> 00:10:50.716
THE LIKE AND WE'RE BASICALLY

00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:53.252
CODIFYING THAT ZERO BAIL.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:54.653
MEASURE THAT WAS VETTED BY THE

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.223
COURTS DOES FOUR THINGS FIRST.

00:10:57.289 --> 00:10:58.557
IT LEVELS THE PRE TRIAL PLAYING

00:10:58.624 --> 00:11:00.393
FIELD BY SETTING BAIL AT ZERO

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:02.161
DOLLARS. FOR MOST MISDEMEANORS

00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:04.230
AND LOW LEVEL FELONIES EXACTLY

00:11:04.296 --> 00:11:05.398
HOW THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THAT

00:11:05.464 --> 00:11:07.333
AN EMERGENCY ORDER OF APRIL

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.068
TWENTY TWENTY SECOND. IT

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:10.870
ENSURES THAT THE ACCUSED DID

00:11:10.936 --> 00:11:12.638
NOT ASSUME ANY COSTS OF COURT

00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:13.839
IMPOSED PRETRIAL RELEASE

00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:15.307
CONDITIONS ANOTHER ISSUE

00:11:15.374 --> 00:11:17.109
COMPLETELY UNFAIR ABOUT THE

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:18.778
RICH VERSUS THE POOR. IF YOU'RE

00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:20.046
POOR YOU'RE STUCK IN JAIL YOU

00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:20.746
DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY THAT'S

00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:23.282
WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO IS ONE

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:23.849
OF THE CORE JUSTICE ELEMENTS

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:25.618
HERE THREE. REQUIRES BILL

00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:27.386
COMPANIES TO REFORM THE

00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:28.487
PREMIUMS THEY RECEIVE FROM

00:11:28.554 --> 00:11:30.122
PEOPLE ARRESTED BUT ARE

00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:31.857
CHARGED. WITH THEIR CASES

00:11:31.924 --> 00:11:34.260
DISMISSED IT AVOIDS THIS

00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:36.262
UNBELIEVABLE PREDATORY LENDING

00:11:36.328 --> 00:11:38.230
COULD YOU IMAGINE. IF YOU WANT

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:40.666
HAD A LOAN AGAINST YOUR HOUSE

00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:41.267
FOR FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:42.301
TO PAY A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:44.270
FREE HOPE SORRY THE LOAN NEVER

00:11:44.336 --> 00:11:45.671
WENT THROUGH BUT WE GET TO KEEP

00:11:45.738 --> 00:11:46.772
THE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. I

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:49.508
GIVE YOU A HUNDRED EXAMPLES OF

00:11:49.575 --> 00:11:51.877
JUST HOW. LEE UNFAIR THAT IS

00:11:51.944 --> 00:11:53.712
AND FOURTH IT ENSURES THAT THE

00:11:53.779 --> 00:11:55.181
ACCUSED TO NOT REMAIN IN

00:11:55.247 --> 00:11:57.850
CUSTODY SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY

00:11:57.917 --> 00:12:01.087
CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY BAIL. ABOUT

00:12:01.153 --> 00:12:02.521
THE SUPREME COURT HAS JUST

00:12:02.588 --> 00:12:05.424
HEARD IN JANUARY VERY IMPORTANT

00:12:05.491 --> 00:12:06.926
CASE CALLED IN RE HUMPHRIES. IT

00:12:06.992 --> 00:12:09.028
DEALS WITH THE ABILITY OF A POP

00:12:09.095 --> 00:12:11.097
UP- SOMEONE WHO'S ACCUSED

00:12:11.163 --> 00:12:13.132
ABILITY TO PAY A DALE. THAT

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:14.900
CASE I'M TOLD WE SPOKE WITH A

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:15.935
LAWYER YESTERDAY WHO ARGUED THE

00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:17.636
CASE THAT DECISION MAY COME

00:12:17.703 --> 00:12:19.371
DOWN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS SO

00:12:19.438 --> 00:12:20.406
RATHER THAN IN THE LANGUAGE

00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:22.308
THIS MEASURE MAKE AN ASSUMPTION

00:12:22.374 --> 00:12:23.609
WE SIMPLY REFERENCE THE

00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:28.914
HUMPHRIES CASE AS TO. GUIDED BY

00:12:28.981 --> 00:12:32.985
THAT. SECOND FROM THE APRIL TO

00:12:33.052 --> 00:12:35.121
THE SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY

00:12:35.187 --> 00:12:37.022
WHEN THE ZERO BILL ORDER WAS IN

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:40.192
PLACE THE BOTTOM LINE IS ALL OF

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:42.394
THE DATA PP I SEE WE'VE GOT

00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:43.229
SOME OPTIONS SOME LETTERS WERE

00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:44.930
PEOPLE TELL ONE STORY OR

00:12:44.997 --> 00:12:46.565
ANOTHER STORY ABOUT SOMEBODY

00:12:46.632 --> 00:12:47.933
WHO GOT OUT OF JAIL AND CAUSED

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.335
ANOTHER CRIME OR WHATEVER THE

00:12:49.401 --> 00:12:51.937
CASE MAY BE BUT THE EALITY IS

00:12:52.004 --> 00:12:53.472
THAT PROPERTY CRIMES HAVE

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:54.974
DECREASED DURING THAT TIME

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.942
FRAME SECOND VIOLENT CRIMES

00:12:57.009 --> 00:12:58.077
HAVE REMAINED CONSISTENT

00:12:58.144 --> 00:12:59.311
THERE'S NO FUN FUNDAMENTAL

00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:00.412
DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THIS

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:02.181
POLICY THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:03.382
PEOPLE ARE TREATED WITH JUSTICE

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:04.617
AND DIGNITY THAT GO OVER THEIR

00:13:04.683 --> 00:13:05.818
FAMILIES. THEY CAN DEAL WITH

00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:06.752
THE ISSUES THEY CAN HIRE A

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:08.454
LAWYER THEY CAN KEEP THEIR JOB

00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:09.488
THEY DON'T HAVE ALL THE OTHER

00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:10.556
CONSEQUENCES THEIR LIVES ARE

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.358
NOT COPPING A PLEA YOUR CASE TO

00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:15.494
GET A JAIL BECAUSE OUR LIFE IS

00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:16.362
TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. SO IT IS

00:13:16.428 --> 00:13:18.864
JUST EXTRAORDINARY. THAT WHAT

00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:20.399
WE'VE LEARNED IS HOW EFFECTIVE

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:22.635
THE ZERO BALANCE AND IN FACT.

00:13:22.701 --> 00:13:23.202
THIRTY ONE COUNTIES IN THE

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:24.703
STATE OF CALIFORNIA STILLHAVE

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.405
THE ZERO BILL SYSTEM. AND IT

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:27.773
STILL WORKS YOU'RE GONNA HEAR

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.075
EXAMPLES I'M SURE. OF SOMEBODY

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:31.610
GO TO JAIL THERE WAS SOME

00:13:31.677 --> 00:13:32.745
EXAMPLES AND ONE OF THE LETTER

00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:34.180
OF THIS PERSON HERE AND THAT

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:35.080
PERSON THERE. ALWAYS IS THE

00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:36.982
CASE. WHAT DO WE MAKE PUBLIC

00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:39.318
POLICY BASED UPON THE ISOLATED

00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:40.386
EXAMPLE IN ONE INSTANCE TO

00:13:40.452 --> 00:13:41.520
ANOTHER BASED UPON THE

00:13:41.587 --> 00:13:42.922
OPERATION ORDER WE LOOK AT THE

00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:44.757
LARGE BODY OF DATA. IN TERMS OF

00:13:44.823 --> 00:13:48.727
WHAT IMPACT THERE IS TO SOCIETY.

00:13:48.794 --> 00:13:51.463
WHAT WE KNOW. IS THAT. IN

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:54.166
TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY THIS IS SO

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:56.602
CRAZY AND SO SIMPLE. IF YOU TAX

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:58.337
TO SOMEBODY. PEOPLE ARE NOT

00:13:58.404 --> 00:14:00.039

ARE GOING TO SOME PLACE. THAT

00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:04.443
DOESN'T HAVE EXTRADITION.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.579
THEY'RE BUSY. THIRD GOT WORK

00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:08.547
THEIR KIDS GOT SICK. THEY LOST

THEIR PAPERWORK WHO KNOWS.

00:14:10.616 --> 00:14:12.251
SHOULD THE EIGHTY BE SUBJECT TO

00:14:12.318 --> 00:14:13.919

00:36:34.325 --> 00:36:40.898
MAKE COMMENTS BEFORE YOU DO- WE

00:36:40.965 --> 00:36:43.000
HAVE A BASIC FUNDAMENTAL FACT

00:36:43.067 --> 00:36:45.836
THAT. BECAUSE OF OUR THE WAY

00:36:45.903 --> 00:36:47.505
OUR CURRENT MONEY BAIL SYSTEM

00:36:47.572 --> 00:36:49.707
IS DESIGNED. PEOPLE WITH MONEY

00:36:49.774 --> 00:36:51.842
GET OUT OF JAIL AND PEOPLE

00:36:51.909 --> 00:36:54.378
WITHOUT DUE NORTH. AND THAT IS

00:36:54.445 --> 00:36:56.581
FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR. AND THAT

00:36:56.647 --> 00:36:59.717
WEALTH TEST MEANS THAT SOME

00:36:59.784 --> 00:37:01.886
PEOPLE AND AGAIN EVEN OUR

00:37:01.953 --> 00:37:03.554
JUSTICE SYSTEM IS BASED ON

00:37:03.621 --> 00:37:05.456
INNOCENCE UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.

00:37:05.523 --> 00:37:08.626
BUT THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A-

00:37:08.693 --> 00:37:10.494
DOLLARS AMOUNT THEN THAT

00:37:10.561 --> 00:37:12.129
DETERMINES WHETHER YOU SIT IN

00:37:12.196 --> 00:37:14.599
JAIL PRIOR TO A TRIAL. IS IN

00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:17.034
EFFECT LIKE A GUILTY SENTENCE

00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:18.703
BECAUSE THE IMPACT OF SITTING

00:37:18.769 --> 00:37:20.805
IN JAIL MEANS THAT YOU'RE NOT

00:37:20.871 --> 00:37:22.974
GOING TO WORK THUS YOU MAY EVEN

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.076
LOSE YOUR JOB AS A RESULT MOST

00:37:25.142 --> 00:37:27.044
LIKELY YES. THE END YOU ARE

00:37:27.111 --> 00:37:28.245
ALSO NOT BEING ABLE TO

00:37:28.312 --> 00:37:29.447
CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR HOUSEHOLD

00:37:29.513 --> 00:37:31.882
EXPENSES WHICH PUTS YOUR FAMILY

00:37:31.949 --> 00:37:34.352
IN A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION

00:37:34.418 --> 00:37:37.121
OR IF YOU'RE A- SINGLE

00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:38.923
INDIVIDUAL. IT CAN PUT YOU IN

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:40.891
ARREARS INTO AND GET YOU INTO

00:37:40.958 --> 00:37:43.961
DEBT. IT PUT YOU TAKES YOU AWAY

00:37:44.028 --> 00:37:46.430
FROM YOUR FAMILY. AND IT CAN

00:37:46.497 --> 00:37:48.332
CREATE A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE FOR

00:37:48.399 --> 00:37:49.734
EXAMPLE IF YOU GET BEHIND ON

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.469
CAR PAYMENT OR A RENT PAYMENT

00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:54.572
YOU CAN LOSE YOUR ABILITY TO

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:57.108
YOUR VEHICLE YOU'RE AT WHERE

00:37:57.174 --> 00:37:59.176
YOU LIVE. NOW WHAT KIND OF

00:37:59.243 --> 00:38:02.446
JUSTICE IS THAT IT IS NOT

00:38:02.513 --> 00:38:05.616
JUSTICE IN TERMS OF THE MY

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:07.885
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT OUR

00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:11.155
JUSTICE SYSTEM IS TRYING TO BE-

00:38:11.222 --> 00:38:13.324
THE OTHER THING WE HAVE BEEN IN

00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:14.792
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND

00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:16.894
I'D SAY MUCH MORE SO. IN THE

00:38:16.961 --> 00:38:20.798
LAST NINE MONTHS. LOOKING MORE

00:38:20.865 --> 00:38:23.401
SPECIFICALLY THROUGH A RACIAL

00:38:23.467 --> 00:38:25.736
LENS AS TO HOW TO CHESTER

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:28.039
CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICIES BUT-

00:38:28.105 --> 00:38:29.407
ALL KINDS OF POLICIES HOUSING

00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:31.375
POLICIES YOU NAME IMPACT

00:38:31.442 --> 00:38:34.812
DIFFERENT PEOPLE. AND IF WE

00:38:34.879 --> 00:38:37.181
TAKE JUST THE BLACK COMMUNITY

00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:40.518
SO JUST BLACK CALIFORNIANS. AND

00:38:40.584 --> 00:38:43.054
WE LOOKED AT. HOW THE SYSTEM

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:47.291
IMPACTS. BLACK CALIFORNIANS ARE

00:38:47.358 --> 00:38:49.694
DETAINED DETAINED AT A RATE

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.595
FIVE TIMES HIGHER THAN WHAT

00:38:51.662 --> 00:38:53.998
CALIFORNIANS BLACK DEFENDANTS

00:38:54.065 --> 00:38:55.766
ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE RELEASED

00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:58.335
ON THEIR OWN RECOGNIZANCE THAN

00:38:58.402 --> 00:39:00.271
WHITE DEFENDANTS AND BLACK

00:39:00.337 --> 00:39:02.139
DEFENDANTS AGES EIGHTEEN

00:39:02.206 --> 00:39:04.175
THROUGH TWENTY NINE RECEIVE

00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:06.444
HIGHER BAIL AMOUNTS THAN ANY

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:08.846
OTHER GROUP AND WHEN YOU LOOK

00:39:08.913 --> 00:39:11.348
AT THAT. AND YOU ALSO LOOK AT

00:39:11.415 --> 00:39:13.284
WEALTH COMPARISONS OF BLACK

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:16.787
AMERICANS TO WHITE AMERICANS

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:18.322
WERE CALIFORNIANS SPECIFICALLY.

00:39:18.389 --> 00:39:19.824
BLACK AMERICANS HAVE BLACK

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:21.092
CALIFORNIANS HAVE FAR LESS

00:39:21.158 --> 00:39:23.094
WEALTH COMPARATIVELY SO THEN

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.729
THEY ARE PUT FURTHER IN THE

00:39:24.795 --> 00:39:27.364
CIRCUMSTANCE OF NOT BEING ABLE

00:39:27.431 --> 00:39:29.233
TO AFFORD BAIL NOW FOR SOME

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.635
PEOPLE THEY USE A HOME. IN

00:39:31.702 --> 00:39:32.837
ORDER TO PUT UP THE SECURITY

00:39:32.903 --> 00:39:35.372
FOR BILL BUT WE SAW WITH IN

00:39:35.439 --> 00:39:37.041
GENERAL THERE'S LESS

00:39:37.108 --> 00:39:38.542
HOMEOWNERSHIP BY BLACK

00:39:38.609 --> 00:39:40.311
CALIFORNIANS IN WITH THE LAST

00:39:40.377 --> 00:39:42.213
GREAT RECESSION IT DROPPED EVEN

00:39:42.279 --> 00:39:44.381
FURTHER. AND HOPEFULLY THIS

00:39:44.448 --> 00:39:46.016
PANDEMIC INDUCED RECESSION WILL

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:48.052
NOT CAUSE A FURTHER DROP IN

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:50.654
BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP BUT ONCE

00:39:50.721 --> 00:39:54.425
ONE'S ABILITY TO RETAIN THEIR

00:39:54.492 --> 00:39:56.427
HOME SHOULD NOT. P. BUT

00:39:56.494 --> 00:39:59.430
THREATENED BY A UNFAIR MONEY

00:39:59.497 --> 00:40:02.099
BAIL SYSTEM SO I AM VERY PROUD

THAT AND A- JOINT AUTHOR OF

00:40:06.737 --> 00:40:08.873
THIS BILL BUT SENATOR ERTZBERG

00:40:16.647 --> 00:40:17.414
BILL LAST YEAR ON THAT ISSUE

00:40:17.481 --> 00:40:19.683
BUT- CALIFORNIA WE DO THIS ALL

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.118
THE TIME DOESN'T MATTER IF

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:22.486
YOU'RE DEMOCRAT REPUBLICAN

00:40:22.553 --> 00:40:23.053
CONSERVATIVE LIBERAL DOESN'T

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:26.257
MATTER. GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT

00:40:26.323 --> 00:40:28.325
THERE'S SOME BEHAVIOR THAT'S

00:40:28.392 --> 00:40:30.361
UNFAIR YOU CAN'T CHARGE

00:40:30.427 --> 00:40:33.464
SOMEBODY 2000% INTEREST TODAY.

00:40:33.531 --> 00:40:36.167
ITS USERS WE GO MAKE THOSE

00:40:36.233 --> 00:40:38.402
AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY AND SO

00:40:38.469 --> 00:40:40.137
WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'VE GOT THIS

00:40:40.204 --> 00:40:41.172
INDUSTRY THIS IS WILSHIRE

00:40:41.238 --> 00:40:42.706
INDUSTRY AND COMES UP WITH SOME

00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:44.942
LEGAL DEFINITION. OF THIS A

00:40:45.009 --> 00:40:45.976
FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT CASE

00:40:46.043 --> 00:40:47.711
RIGHT NOW IN THE BAY AREA IN

00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:49.446
YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS SENATOR

00:40:49.513 --> 00:40:51.282
THAT LOOKS AT THE ISSUE OF

00:40:51.348 --> 00:40:54.752
PRICE FIXING THIS IS A BIG.

00:40:54.819 --> 00:40:57.922
THAT SAYS WELL. IT'S 10% WELL

00:40:57.988 --> 00:40:59.857
GREAT IF YOU GO BY CAR YOU GO

00:40:59.924 --> 00:41:00.925

00:41:00.991 --> 00:41:02.226
THE SAME PRICE THAT'S PRICE

00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:03.294
FIXING I THINK THEY'RE GOING

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.162
BIG TROUBLE I THINK YOU LOSE

00:41:05.229 --> 00:41:06.864
BIG. I THINK THAT THE AMOUNT OF

00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:08.599
TIME THEY HAVE ON THE CLOCK IS

00:41:08.666 --> 00:41:10.835
TICKING AWAY BECAUSE THE WHOLE

00:41:10.901 --> 00:41:13.671
SYSTEM IS BASED UPON.

00:41:13.737 --> 00:41:15.573
UNFAIRNESS TO THE PUBLIC. AT

00:41:15.639 --> 00:41:17.074
EVERY LEVEL AND SO THE ISSUE

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:19.043
ABOUT BEING AN INSURANCE POLICY

00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.877
AND WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:22.012
ARGUE. ARE JUST LEGAL FICTIONS

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:23.814
THE REALITY IS GOVERNMENT ALL

00:41:23.881 --> 00:41:25.983
THE TIME ENGAGED IN CONSUMER

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:28.152
PROTECTION. ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN

00:41:28.219 --> 00:41:29.920
CHARGE WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE

00:41:29.987 --> 00:41:31.322
WHAT TYPE OF DISCLOSURES HAVE

00:41:31.388 --> 00:41:32.790
TO BE AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS

00:41:32.857 --> 00:41:34.024
AND WE ALL SUPPORT THOSE ALMOST

00:41:34.091 --> 00:41:35.860
A UNANIMOUS BASIS. TO THOSE

00:41:35.926 --> 00:41:37.027
ARGUMENTS FAIL AND I THINK

00:41:37.094 --> 00:41:38.796
THAT'S A REALLY IN TROUBLE ON

00:41:38.863 --> 00:41:42.633

TO- ON IN RE WEB WE WAS A BY

00:45:48.979 --> 00:45:49.780
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN CASE HELD

00:45:49.847 --> 00:45:51.448
THE TRIAL COURTS DO HAVE THE

00:45:51.515 --> 00:45:52.916
AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE REASONABLE

00:45:52.983 --> 00:45:55.018
CONDITIONS. RELATING TO PUBLIC

SAFETY AND PERSONS RELEASED ON

00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:58.522
BAIL. THAT SOMETIMES RELEASING

REALITY IS CERTAINLY JUDGE

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:10.868
COULD MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS

00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:11.935
THAT HAS BEEN NOT LOST UNDER

00:46:12.002 --> 00:46:13.704
THE- CONSTITUTION THAT THERE'S

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:14.838
BEEN ARGUED IT'S JUST BEEN

00:46:14.905 --> 00:46:16.773
MISREPRESENTED. AND THERE IS

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.375
FLEXIBILITY IN THAT SO WE'RE

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:19.309
WORKING WITHIN THE EXISTING

00:46:19.376 --> 00:46:21.044
STRUCTURE. OF WHAT COUNTRIES

00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:22.546
BAIL. WE'RE ASKING THE JUDICIAL

00:46:22.613 --> 00:46:24.615
COUNCIL TO COME UP WITH THE

00:46:24.681 --> 00:46:26.683
BAIL SCHEDULE WE'RE WAITING TO

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:27.818
SEE WHAT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:28.752
COURT DOES BECAUSE NO MATTER

00:46:28.819 --> 00:46:30.053
WHAT OUR OPINION HERE IS.

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.188
THAT'S GOING TO CONTROL THE

00:46:31.255 --> 00:46:33.123
DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:34.091
SOMEONE HAS TO PAY TO GET OUT

00:46:34.158 --> 00:46:35.959
OR NOT. AND WE'LL SEE WHAT THAT

00:46:36.026 --> 00:46:38.695
LOOKS LIKE. RIGHT AND WE ARE

00:46:38.762 --> 00:46:41.298
TRYING TO WHO. WERE RELYING ON

00:46:41.365 --> 00:46:43.367
WHAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL DID

00:46:43.433 --> 00:46:44.434
THEY GAVE US A GREAT DEAL OF

00:46:44.501 --> 00:46:47.171
THOUGHT. AND HAS A RECORD FROM

00:46:47.237 --> 00:46:49.840
APRIL TO SEPTEMBER. AND THIRTY

00:46:49.907 --> 00:46:50.641
ONE COUNTIES HAVE CONTINUED

00:46:50.707 --> 00:46:52.009
THIS SO THIS IS NOT JUST

00:46:52.075 --> 00:46:53.710
INVENTING SOMETHING AT A PIE IN

00:46:53.777 --> 00:46:55.679
THE SKY. BUT WHATEVER SO VERY

00:46:55.746 --> 00:46:57.614
THOUGHTFUL DELIBERATIVE

00:46:57.681 --> 00:46:59.883
ENDEAVOR. GROUNDED IN VERY

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:02.052
SMART PEOPLE AND GROUNDED IN

00:47:02.119 --> 00:47:04.221
WAITING FOR THE SUPREME COURT'S

00:47:04.288 --> 00:47:05.355
ACTION WHATEVER THAT MIGHT BE.

00:47:05.422 --> 00:47:07.024
I THINK IT HELPS IF I COULD

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:08.759
ANSWER THE QUESTION. THOSE

00:47:08.825 --> 00:47:09.793
QUESTIONS IT DOES AND I'M

MATTER. AND WE ARE FAILING-

02:39:04.234 --> 02:39:07.137
RIGHT NOW AND FEDERAL IS JUST A

02:39:07.204 --> 02:39:09.873
IT'S A DESPICABLE SUBSTANCE.

02:39:09.940 --> 02:39:12.209
AND IT IS JUST HARMING SO MANY

02:39:12.276 --> 02:39:19.316
PEOPLE. BOND IF. THIS BILL. HI

02:39:19.383 --> 02:39:21.952
AN INCREASING THE PENALTIES

02:39:22.019 --> 02:39:24.021
BECAUSE I IT IS A WARNING BUT

02:39:24.087 --> 02:39:25.055
IT'S A WARNING ABOUT THE

02:39:25.122 --> 02:39:27.124
SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO

02:39:27.190 --> 02:39:28.892
INCREASE THE POSSIBILITY OF

02:39:28.959 --> 02:39:31.595
ULTIMATELY PROSECUTING AND

02:39:31.662 --> 02:39:33.397
CONVICTING SOMEONE OF MURDER-

02:39:33.463 --> 02:39:37.701
IF THIS WERE AN EFFECTIVE- WAY

02:39:37.768 --> 02:39:42.205
OF REDUCING. DRUG USE REDUCING-

02:39:42.272 --> 02:39:44.041
DRUG DEALING IT WILL BE

02:39:44.107 --> 02:39:45.709
SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT AND

02:39:45.776 --> 02:39:47.945
CONSIDER- BUT I DON'T BELIEVE

02:39:48.011 --> 02:39:50.080
THAT IT WILL AND THE REASON

02:39:50.147 --> 02:39:52.316
THAT I SAY THAT AS WE HAVE.

02:39:52.382 --> 02:39:56.019
DONE THIS BEFORE. WE HAVE-

02:39:56.086 --> 02:39:57.854
WE'VE GONE THROUGH LONG PERIODS

02:39:57.921 --> 02:40:00.190
OF TIME IN THIS COUNTRY. OF

02:40:00.257 --> 02:40:03.226
INCARCERATING DRUG DEALERS

02:40:03.293 --> 02:40:03.727
INCLUDING LOW LEVEL DRUG

02:40:03.794 --> 02:40:07.130
DEALERS. FOR LONG LONG PERIODS

02:40:07.197 --> 02:40:08.999
OF TIME DRUG DEALERS WHOSE

02:40:09.066 --> 02:40:11.868
DEALING LEAD TO DEATH OR NOT.

02:40:11.935 --> 02:40:13.870
PUTTING THEM AWAY FOR YEARS OR

02:40:13.937 --> 02:40:17.741
DECADES ARM BANDS. AND THAT ID

02:40:17.808 --> 02:40:20.811
NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. IT DID

02:40:20.877 --> 02:40:23.647
NOT REDUCE DRUG USE THE NOT

02:40:23.714 --> 02:40:28.719
pAND OVERDOSE OR MUCH WORSE NOW

02:40:28.785 --> 02:40:30.120
THAN THEY WERE BEFORE. WE

02:40:30.187 --> 02:40:33.991
ADOPTED THOSE HARSH PENALTIES.

02:40:34.057 --> 02:40:36.893
AND SO YOU KNOW PUTTING MORE

02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:37.694
PEOPLE WAY FOR LONG PERIODS OF

02:40:37.761 --> 02:40:40.797
TIME IS NOT GOING TO REDUCE THE

02:40:40.864 --> 02:40:43.066
SUPPLY OF DRUGS AS LONG AS

02:40:43.133 --> 02:40:45.268

REDUCTION AND TO PROHIBIT. OF

02:41:04.821 --> 02:41:06.390
HARM REDUCTION METHODS THAT

02:41:06.456 --> 02:41:08.759
HAVE BEEN PROVEN- TO ACTUALLY

02:41:08.825 --> 02:41:10.961
HELP. IT IS ACTUALLY STILL A

02:41:11.028 --> 02:41:13.397
LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE

SOMEONE WITH A FRONTAL STRIP SO

02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:18.168
THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY SWAP AND

02:41:18.235 --> 02:41:19.569

IT'S NOT GOING TO PREVENT ANY

02:41:36.019 --> 02:41:38.555
OVERDOSES- AND I THINK THAT IS

02:41:38.622 --> 02:41:40.891

02:44:21.017 --> 02:44:23.286
BEFORE THE JUDGE SO TELLING THE

02:44:23.353 --> 02:44:26.456
JUDGE TO. COMMUNICATE THAT TO

02:44:26.523 --> 02:44:28.692
THE PERSON. IT DIDN'T IT

02:44:28.758 --> 02:44:30.026
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING THAT'S WHY

02:44:30.093 --> 02:44:32.662
WE HAVE THE IMPLIED MALICE IN

02:44:32.729 --> 02:44:34.898
THE BILL AS A WARNING AS AN

02:44:34.965 --> 02:44:37.734
ADVISEMENT AND I JUST WANT TO

02:44:37.801 --> 02:44:40.337
STRESS THAT- IT'S NOT A

02:44:40.403 --> 02:44:42.706
GUARANTEE. THAT SOMEONE WOULD

02:44:42.772 --> 02:44:44.274
BE CHARGED WITH THE MURDER.

02:44:44.341 --> 02:44:45.976
IT'S AN OPTION IT'S NOT

02:44:46.042 --> 02:44:48.812
MANDATORY SOME DA'S MAY NOT

02:44:48.878 --> 02:44:50.780
CHOOSE TO GO THAT ROUTE. OTHERS

02:44:50.847 --> 02:44:52.382
MAY FIND CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH

02:44:52.449 --> 02:44:53.183
THEY FIND THAT THAT'S

02:44:53.250 --> 02:44:55.185
APPROPRIATE IT'S NOT DESIGNED

02:44:55.252 --> 02:44:56.920
FOR LIBERAL USE IT'S DESIGNED

02:44:56.987 --> 02:44:59.022
FOR VERY JUDICIOUS USE BUT FOR.

02:44:59.089 --> 02:45:00.490
ME TO REMOVE THE PART OF THE

02:45:00.557 --> 02:45:01.625
BILL THAT IS THE HEART OF THE

02:45:01.691 --> 02:45:04.861
BILL WHICH IS THE ABILITY- TO

02:45:04.928 --> 02:45:06.563
USING IMPLIED MALICE I COULD

02:45:06.630 --> 02:45:08.031
NOT AGREE TO REMOVING THAT FROM

02:45:08.098 --> 02:45:09.633
THE BILL AND ONLY HAVE A BILL

02:45:09.699 --> 02:45:11.635
THAT SAYS. THE JUDGE SHOULD

02:45:11.701 --> 02:45:13.737
READ TO THE DEFENDANT WHAT

02:45:13.803 --> 02:45:15.672
YOU'RE DOING IS DANGEROUS I

02:45:15.739 --> 02:45:17.707
THINK. THEY'RE ALREADY DOING

02:45:17.774 --> 02:45:19.075
THAT SELL TIME AND FORTUNE I

02:45:19.142 --> 02:45:21.111
COULD NOT- EXCEPT THAT

02:45:21.177 --> 02:45:31.821
AMENDMENT IN YOUR CLOTHES. YOU

02:45:31.888 --> 02:45:32.455
MADE MORE SORRY YOUR CONFERENCE

02:45:32.522 --> 02:45:34.391
WILL IN FIVE MINUTES. IN YOUR

02:45:34.457 --> 02:45:36.026
CLOTHES YOU THE- TO THE MORNING

02:45:36.092 --> 02:45:37.527
THAT IS GIVEN IN THE DRIVING K.

02:45:37.594 --> 02:45:39.996
AND WOOD AT THE DRUNK DRIVING

02:45:40.063 --> 02:45:42.098
CASE DO NOT INCLUDE THAT MALICE.

02:45:42.165 --> 02:45:44.701
AND SO YOU USE THAT A- AND

02:45:44.768 --> 02:45:47.103
WHICH- IS ANALOGY THAT I. AGREE

02:45:47.170 --> 02:45:49.639
AND I WOULD ACCOMPLISH MUCH OF

02:45:49.706 --> 02:45:52.342
WHICH YOU ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE

02:45:52.409 --> 02:45:54.878
ESPECIALLY IF WE ARE USING. IF

02:45:54.944 --> 02:45:56.913
WE ARE MAKING THAT COMPARISON-

02:45:56.980 --> 02:45:58.415
HOWEVER THAT A DECISION WHICH

02:45:58.481 --> 02:46:00.450
YOU NOW SAY MAKES YOUR BILL NOT

02:46:00.517 --> 02:46:03.019
USEFUL THEN YOU CAN'T REALLY

02:46:03.086 --> 02:46:05.021
MAKE IT AND YOUR- THE ANALOGY

02:46:05.088 --> 02:46:07.457
TOWARDS WHAT WE HAVE ALLOWED.

02:46:07.524 --> 02:46:10.093
IN STATUTE ON DRUNK DRIVING. SO

02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:13.396
I THINK I- AGAIN I THINK THAT.

02:46:13.463 --> 02:46:15.598
THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION

02:46:15.665 --> 02:46:19.069
IS REASONABLE AND AS YOU KNOW.

02:46:19.135 --> 02:46:20.570
ALL OF OUR BILLS THE WHOLE

02:46:20.637 --> 02:46:22.238
POINT OF THE COMMITTEE PROCESS

02:46:22.305 --> 02:46:23.940
AND OF OUR COMMITTEES

02:46:24.007 --> 02:46:25.942
CONSULTANTS WHO HAVE. MANY

02:46:26.009 --> 02:46:28.511
YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN IN WHAT

02:46:28.578 --> 02:46:31.214
IT WHATEVER THE FIELD IS THAT

02:46:31.281 --> 02:46:32.315
IS OF THE COMMITTEE'S CONCERN

02:46:32.382 --> 02:46:33.350
IN IN THIS CASE AND PUBLIC

02:46:33.416 --> 02:46:35.585
SAFETY WE HAVE CONSULTANTS WHO

02:46:35.652 --> 02:46:38.755
HAVE- PART NOT ONLY EXTREMELY

02:46:38.822 --> 02:46:40.290
FAMILIAR WITH ALL OF CALIFORNIA

02:46:40.357 --> 02:46:42.158
STATUTES BUT ALSO JUDICIAL

02:46:42.225 --> 02:46:43.593
PROCESS HE'S PROSECUTORIAL

02:46:43.660 --> 02:46:46.396
PROCESS HE'S IN OTHERS. AND I

02:46:46.463 --> 02:46:48.198
THINK THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE

02:46:48.264 --> 02:46:52.669
HAVE VALUE AND I CANNOT SPEAK

02:46:52.736 --> 02:46:53.670
FOR MY OTHER COLLEAGUES BUT I

02:46:53.737 --> 02:46:56.072
HAVE I SUSPECT THAT THIS BILL

02:46:56.139 --> 02:46:58.808
WOULD. BE SUCCESSFUL IF THE

02:46:58.875 --> 02:46:59.909
COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WERE

02:46:59.976 --> 02:47:02.312
TAKEN MOST OF US DON'T EXPECT

02:47:02.379 --> 02:47:03.380
TO EVER HAVE ANY OF OUR BILLS

02:47:03.446 --> 02:47:06.182
FLY THROUGH WITHOUT SOME LEVEL

02:47:06.249 --> 02:47:08.518
OF AMENDMENT. SENATOR SKINNER I

02:47:08.585 --> 02:47:09.285
COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE

AND I HAVE MADE NUMEROUS

02:47:11.488 --> 02:47:13.256
COMPROMISES ON BILLS THAT I'VE

02:47:13.323 --> 02:47:14.724
RIGHT BEFORE THE SENATE AND FOR

02:47:14.791 --> 02:47:16.159
THE ASSEMBLY WE ALL HAVE TO DO

02:47:16.226 --> 02:47:17.827
IT. KNOWING GETS THEIR BILL

02:47:17.894 --> 02:47:18.962

PASS WHAT THE COMMITTEE ASKED

02:47:20.830 --> 02:47:22.565
ME TO DO THOUGH ESSENTIALLY WAS

02:47:22.632 --> 02:47:25.034
TO TURN IN A BILL THAT SAYS A

02:47:25.101 --> 02:47:27.404
JUDGE NEEDS TO ADVISE SOMEONE

02:47:27.470 --> 02:47:28.204
THAT THEIR BEHAVIOR THEY'RE

02:47:28.271 --> 02:47:30.039
ENGAGING IN. COULD KILL ANOTHER

02:47:30.106 --> 02:47:32.242
HUMAN BEING THAT'S IT WE DON'T

02:47:32.308 --> 02:47:34.344
NEED A LOT TO DO THAT. A JUDGE

02:47:34.411 --> 02:47:36.079
IS ALREADY DOING THAT WHEN THE

02:47:36.146 --> 02:47:36.980

THAT'S SIMPLY NOT CORRECT IT IS

02:48:13.149 --> 02:48:17.353
DESIGNED TO ALLOW. A PROSECUTOR

02:48:17.420 --> 02:48:21.491
ON A SUBSEQUENT INDICTMENT TO

02:48:21.558 --> 02:48:23.626
USE THE IMPLIED MALICE IN THE

02:48:23.693 --> 02:48:25.695
EVENT THEY WANT TO USE- A

02:48:25.762 --> 02:48:27.263
MURDER CHARGE I DON'T HAVE TO

02:48:27.330 --> 02:48:28.898
BUT IT'S GIVES THEM THE OPTION

02:48:28.965 --> 02:48:29.966
THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES

02:48:30.033 --> 02:48:31.968
THAT'S PART OF THE ADVISEMENT

02:48:32.035 --> 02:48:33.703
WHEN THEY TELL THEM YOU KNOW

02:48:33.770 --> 02:48:34.737
YOU COULD BE CHARGED WITH

02:48:34.804 --> 02:48:36.873
MURDER IN THIS BOX. THAT'S WHAT

02:48:36.940 --> 02:48:40.276

02:49:08.705 --> 02:49:11.374
DOES SO IT IS NOT ANALOGOUS TO

02:49:11.441 --> 02:49:12.809
WHAT WE HAVE LISTED IN THE D.

02:49:12.876 --> 02:49:15.578

TO THIS DRUG. YOU KNOW I WISH

02:50:41.965 --> 02:50:45.501
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO ASK FAMILIES

AND FRIENDS TO RE LIVE- THESE

02:50:48.204 --> 02:50:51.407
MOMENTS BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT

IT CANNOT BE EASY FOR YOU TO DO

CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS BILL DOES

02:51:12.428 --> 02:51:16.899

OVERDOSES ARE ACCIDENTAL- IN MY

02:51:37.954 --> 02:51:40.189
MIND DOES NOT EQUATE

02:51:40.256 --> 02:51:43.226
MANSLAUGHTER OR MURDER. WHAT

02:52:01.477 --> 02:52:04.881
SAD AND UNFORTUNATE AND IT IS

02:52:04.947 --> 02:52:08.184
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE.

02:52:08.251 --> 02:52:11.287
TALKING ABOUT OPENLY AND

02:52:52.428 --> 02:52:55.598
PUTTING FINAL ON TRIAL. WE

02:52:55.665 --> 02:52:58.534
CERTAINLY SHOULD. ABSOLUTELY

02:52:58.601 --> 02:53:01.704
1100% AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN

02:53:01.771 --> 02:53:03.206
FRANCISCO SAID THAT THE WAR ON

02:53:03.272 --> 02:53:05.475
DRUGS HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN TO

02:53:05.541 --> 02:53:09.145
WORK. AN EXPENSIVE COUNTER

02:53:09.212 --> 02:53:10.980
PRODUCTIVE OVER INCARCERATION

02:53:11.047 --> 02:53:13.683
POLICIES ALSO DO NOT WORK HOW

02:53:13.750 --> 02:53:16.519
DO WE FIND. THE RIGHTEOUS

02:53:16.586 --> 02:53:22.258
MIDDLE. THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE.

02:53:22.325 --> 02:53:24.494
AS HARD AS THIS IS TO SAY AND I

02:53:24.560 --> 02:53:25.461
HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF OF IT ALL

02:53:25.528 --> 02:53:27.130
THE TIME YOU KNOW JUSTICE AND

02:53:27.196 --> 02:53:29.031
RETRIBUTION ARE NOT ALWAYS THE

02:53:29.098 --> 02:53:31.400
SAME THING AND IT IS NOT IN THE

02:53:31.467 --> 02:53:33.603
INTEREST OF POLICY MAKERS TO

02:53:33.669 --> 02:53:36.472
CREATE POLICY- THAT DOESN'T

02:53:36.539 --> 02:53:38.608
REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS

02:53:38.674 --> 02:53:40.443
BILL IS NOT GOING TO BRING BACK

02:53:40.510 --> 02:53:41.677
LOVED ONES PEOPLE ON THE PHONE

02:53:41.744 --> 02:53:44.046
ALSO MENTION THAT IT'S NOT

02:53:44.113 --> 02:53:45.381
GOING TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT

02:53:45.448 --> 02:53:47.950
PEOPLE CONTINUE TO EXPERIMENT

02:53:48.017 --> 02:53:49.585
WITH DRUGS IT'S NOT GOING TO

02:53:49.652 --> 02:53:50.686
ADDRESS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE

02:53:50.753 --> 02:53:53.389
CONTINUE TO GET DRUGS. THAT ARE

02:53:53.456 --> 02:53:56.592
UNREGULATED. IT DOESN'T ADDRESS

02:53:56.659 --> 02:54:00.163
ANY OF THAT. AND WHEN WE ARE

02:54:00.229 --> 02:54:02.598
PURCHASING DRUGS OFF THE MARKET

02:54:02.665 --> 02:54:05.067
THERE IS RISK WE SHOULD BE

02:54:05.134 --> 02:54:07.270
TALKING ABOUT THAT AS WELL THIS

02:54:07.336 --> 02:54:09.438
BILL DOESN'T ADDRESS THE ISSUES

02:54:09.505 --> 02:54:11.507
ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION CHAIN.

02:54:11.574 --> 02:54:13.543
IF SOMEONE IS SELLING AND THEN

02:54:13.609 --> 02:54:14.944
THERE ARE NO LONGER SELLING

02:54:15.011 --> 02:54:16.579
MAYBE THEY'VE HAD A COME TO

02:54:16.646 --> 02:54:18.080
JESUS MOMENT THEY'VE THEY'VE

02:54:18.147 --> 02:54:19.582
BEEN DOING THIS THEY STOPPED

02:54:19.649 --> 02:54:21.284
DOING IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME

02:54:21.350 --> 02:54:22.151
WITH THEIR PRODUCT HAPPENS TO

02:54:22.218 --> 02:54:23.986
BE ON THE MARKET OR SOMEONE

02:54:24.053 --> 02:54:24.720
THEN TAKES THAT UP AND TARTS

02:54:24.787 --> 02:54:27.623
DOING IT. DOESN'T ADDRESS THAT

02:54:27.690 --> 02:54:29.458
CIRCUMSTANCE. DOESN'T ADDRESS

02:54:29.525 --> 02:54:30.760
IF YOU'RE SELLING AND YOU DON'T

02:54:30.827 --> 02:54:32.695
EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SELLING.

02:54:32.762 --> 02:54:34.297
YOU'VE JUST BEEN CAUGHT UP IN

02:54:34.363 --> 02:54:36.098
THIS AND YOU'RE BEING TOLD TO

02:54:36.165 --> 02:54:37.066
DO SOMETHING BECAUSE OF SOME

02:54:37.133 --> 02:54:38.501
OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE DOESN'T

02:54:38.568 --> 02:54:41.370
ADDRESS THAT. DOESN'T ADDRESS

02:54:41.437 --> 02:54:42.772
THE FACT THAT MAYBE YOU'VE GONE

02:54:42.839 --> 02:54:44.140
TO THE BLACK MARKET TO BUY AN

02:54:44.207 --> 02:54:45.942
UNREGULATED PRODUCT BECAUSE

YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO OR YOU

02:54:48.077 --> 02:54:52.215
CAN'T PURCHASE A REGULATED PALE.

02:54:52.281 --> 02:54:53.916
ALL OF THOSE ARE POLICY ISSUES

02:54:53.983 --> 02:54:55.251
THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IF

02:54:55.318 --> 02:54:56.385
YOU'RE GOING TO ESSENTIALLY

02:54:56.452 --> 02:54:58.254
OPEN THE DOOR TO ALLOW SOMEONE

02:54:58.321 --> 02:55:01.290
TO BE CHARGED WITH MURDER. IF I

02:55:01.357 --> 02:55:03.426

TO A USER OF BY BATCH I SHOULD

02:56:36.752 --> 02:56:37.853

HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL THERE'S

02:56:39.588 --> 02:56:42.058
INHERENT RISK IN DOING SO EVEN

02:56:42.124 --> 02:56:43.926
FROM LEGAL DRUGS WE HAVE PLENTY

02:56:43.993 --> 02:56:47.096

AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL THAT I

02:57:06.949 --> 02:57:08.384

02:57:10.653 --> 02:57:13.723

ALL WE DO IS INCARCERATED

02:57:30.973 --> 02:57:32.441
PEOPLE IN AS I THINK THE

02:57:32.508 --> 02:57:32.975
SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO

02:57:33.042 --> 02:57:35.611

GET INTO SOME PERSON THERE BUT

02:58:28.597 --> 02:58:29.765
AGAIN THERE'S A LEVEL OF

02:58:29.832 --> 02:58:32.501
CULPABILITY. IN SELLING SOMEONE
