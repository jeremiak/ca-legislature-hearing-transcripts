COMMON GROUND TO STRENGTHEN
OUR ADVOCACY AND DIVERSITY

00:16:04.663 --> 00:16:07.833
IS REALLY A STRENGTH IN
OUR COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:12.304
DEVELOPING NEW RESOURCES ON
OUR LOCAL CHALLENGES SIMILAR

00:16:12.371 --> 00:16:16.442
TO WHAT I HEARD AND FRESNO
TRANSPORTATION HOUSING WERE

00:16:16.508 --> 00:16:20.512
HIGH COST AREA FOR WORKERS
WE HAVE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGES

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:24.550
THAT ARE NOT MET BY THIS THE
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE NEED

00:16:24.616 --> 00:16:28.987
BI LINGUAL THERAPIST AND OTHER
STAFF WHO ARE NOT READILY

00:16:29.054 --> 00:16:32.891
AVAILABLE AND PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN SUFFERING SINCE THE GREAT

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:37.062
RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND AND
EIGHT ON MEDIAN RATES WERE

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:39.698
IMPOSED ON REGIONAL CENTERS
IN TERMS OF WHAT WE COULD

00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:44.436
PAY PROVIDERS -- PROVIDERS
HAD TO MEET A UNIFORM HOLIDAY

00:16:44.503 --> 00:16:48.874
SCHEDULE -- WERE IT TAPPED
THE BILLING WAS IMPOSED ON

00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:52.878
PROVIDERS TO BILL CHILDREN
WHO WERE ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY

00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:57.416
START WERE LIMITED -- WE LOST
FLEXIBILITY ANNUAL FAMILY

00:16:57.483 --> 00:17:00.953
PROGRAM FEES WERE IMPOSED ON
THERE WAS INCREASE RELIANCE

00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:04.690
ON INSURANCE AND FOR MANY
PEOPLE ELIMINATION OF SOCIAL

00:17:04.757 --> 00:17:10.662
RECREATION CAMPING WAS A REALLY
BIG DEAL OF THE FAST -- AND OUR

00:17:10.729 --> 00:17:14.600
CHALLENGES AS A REGIONAL CENTER
OR WE HAVE A FUNDING FORMULA

00:17:14.666 --> 00:17:18.404
FOR REGIONAL CENTERS THAT IS
ANTIQUATED DATES BACK TO THE

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.307
EIGHT NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND
EARLY NINETIES WE STATE WIDE

00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:26.445
NEED MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED AND
FIFTY MORE CASE WORKERS TO MEET

00:17:26.512 --> 00:17:31.049
OUR CASELOAD RAY FEELS WE --
HAVE THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD THE

00:17:31.116 --> 00:17:34.620
ABILITY TO DEVELOP NEW SERVICES
BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT HAVE

00:17:34.686 --> 00:17:38.757
FUNDING FOR START UP FOR THE
COMMUNITY SO OUR PROVIDERS ARE

00:17:38.824 --> 00:17:42.861
CLOSING BECAUSE THEY'RE UNABLE
TO RETAIN STAFF AND UNABLE

00:17:42.928 --> 00:17:46.932
TO EXPAND THE GROWTH THERE IS
GROWTH IN POPULATION BUT NOT

00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:51.069
AVAILABLE SERVICES THERE'S A
HIGH TURNOVER OF DIRECT SERVICE

00:17:51.136 --> 00:17:54.173
STAFF AND THAT MEANS LESS
TRAINING AND PUTS VULNERABLE

00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:57.709
PEOPLE AT RISK WHEN YOU HAVE
THAT KIND OF TALK TURN OVER

00:17:57.776 --> 00:18:01.313
AND WE CAN'T MEET THE PROMISES
IN THE I PP AND I'LL TELL YOU

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.317
QUICKLY WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
WE NEED TO END MEDIAN RATES WE

00:18:05.384 --> 00:18:09.855
NEED TO ALLOW REGIONAL CENTERS
FLEXIBILITY TO MEET LOCAL NEEDS

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:14.092
WE NEED TO INCREASE PROVIDER
RATE TO REFLECT THE AREA COSTS

00:18:14.159 --> 00:18:17.796
AND ALLOW FOR ADJUSTMENT NGUYEN
MINIMUM WAGES COME IN AS IN

00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:21.834
THE MUNICIPALITY WE NEED TO
RESTORE SOCIAL RECREATION AND

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.971
CAMPING WE NEED TO ELIMINATE
THE ANNUAL FAMILY PROGRAM FEE

00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:29.975
THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE A
HALF DAY BILLING AND WE NEED TO

00:18:30.042 --> 00:18:33.645
UPDATE REGIONAL CENTER FUNDING
FORMULAS TO REFLECT TWENTY

00:18:33.712 --> 00:18:38.617
EIGHTEEN REALITIES AND LASTLY
I'LL SAY IN OUR COMMUNITY WE

00:18:38.684 --> 00:18:42.221
LOOK A COLLABORATION SO WE
NEED TO KEEP THE DOLLARS THAT

00:18:42.287 --> 00:18:46.024
HAVE BEEN SAVED BY CLOSING
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS IN OUR

00:18:46.091 --> 00:18:50.996
SYSTEM WE NEED TO SUPPORT
INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS HOUSING

00:18:51.063 --> 00:18:54.500
NEEDS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING
WE NEED TO RESTORE FUNDING

00:18:54.566 --> 00:18:57.936
FOR NEWS START A PROGRAM OF
NEW PROGRAMS AND WE NEED TO

00:18:58.003 --> 00:19:01.440
DO SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE
THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH

00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:05.444
DEPARTMENTS IN EVERY COUNTY
SERVE PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL

00:19:05.511 --> 00:19:09.248
DISABILITIES WHO ARE ACTUALLY
AT HIGHER RISK OF HAVING MENTAL

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:11.316
HEALTH CHALLENGES THANK YOU

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.397
REASON THERE MAY BE SOME
QUESTIONS FROM -- MY COLLEAGUES

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:29.301
-- I'LL START WITH THE MISTER
LOWER IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS

00:19:29.368 --> 00:19:34.139
OF THE EXACT QUICKER I I DO
I DO IF IF I IF I MY DAD JUST

00:19:34.206 --> 00:19:37.476
VERY IT AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE
YOU OUTLINED A NUMBER OF

00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:40.746
DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS WHICH IS
GREAT -- MIGHT YOU HAVE ANY

00:19:40.812 --> 00:19:44.016
SUGGESTIONS ON THE FUNDING
MECHANISM FOR THAT WELL I

00:19:44.082 --> 00:19:48.220
THINK THAT THE RATE STUDY THAT
IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW FOR OUR

00:19:48.287 --> 00:19:52.257
SERVICE PROVIDERS WE NEED TO
FULLY FUND AND MAYBE WE HAVEN'T

00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:55.427
SEEN THE RATE STUDY MAYBE
WILL THINK WE NEED MORE IN

00:19:55.494 --> 00:19:59.231
CERTAIN COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY
HIGH COST COMMUNITIES I ALSO

00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:03.101
THINK THAT THE STATE NEEDS
TO FUND SERVICE COORDINATORS

00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:06.071
AT A REALISTIC WAY TO
RIGHT NOW THEY'RE FUNDED AT

00:20:06.138 --> 00:20:09.308
THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND FIVE
HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR SERVICE

00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:12.611
COORDINATOR WE CANNOT HIRE
SOMEONE TO PROVIDE THE KIND

00:20:12.678 --> 00:20:15.180
OF SERVICES THAT PEOPLE NEED

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:19.451
MISSED FOR ANY QUESTIONS
THANK IS PROBABLY JUST MORE

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:22.721
OF A COMMA BUT IN YOUR FIRST
DOWN BULLET ITEM HERE ON YOUR

00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:25.490
CLEVER SOLUTIONS YOU TO KEEP
IN THE DOLLARS FROM CLOSED

00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:28.860
A CENTERS I'VE HEARD THAT A
COUPLE TIMES JUST TONIGHT AND

00:20:28.927 --> 00:20:31.163
SO I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S
AWESOME THAT IS HERE AND IT'S

00:20:31.229 --> 00:20:34.132
SOMETHING THAT -- I COULD GET
PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT FIGHT FOR

00:20:34.199 --> 00:20:36.234
BECAUSE THOSE NUMBERS THOSE
DOLLARS ARE ALREADY THERE

00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:38.670
WE'VE GOT TO KEEP THEM HERE
SO I THINK THAT THAT'S AS FAR

00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:41.873
AS LOW HANGING FRUIT SOMETHING
THAT WE CAN BE WORKED OUT GREAT

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:47.045
RESTORATION YES ARE THERE AREAS
THAT YOU'VE NOTICED WHERE OTHER

00:20:47.112 --> 00:20:51.550
HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS OR PROVIDERS
WERE THERE SEEMS TO BE RE DONE

00:20:51.617 --> 00:20:55.921
AND SEE WHERE WE IF WE WERE
TO CONSOLIDATE OR BRING SOME

00:20:55.988 --> 00:21:00.125
SCHOOLS SOURCES TOGETHER -- WE
COULD GET INSTEAD OF A SPRAY

00:21:00.192 --> 00:21:03.495
WE GET A LASER AND BECOME A
BIT MORE PRODUCTIVE HAVE YOU

00:21:03.562 --> 00:21:06.798
IDENTIFIED IN THE THOSE ARE
IS IN YOUR FIELD WELL WHAT

00:21:06.865 --> 00:21:10.535
OUT WHAT I'LL SAY IS THAT I DO
THINK THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES

00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:14.840
WITH FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH
CARE CENTERS TO HELP WITH ON

00:21:14.906 --> 00:21:18.744
HEALTH CARE NEEDS WHERE THE
SERVICES ARE CONCENTRATED IN

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:23.815
ONE PLACE WITH PEOPLE WITH
SPECIALTY KNOWLEDGE -- BUT I

00:21:23.882 --> 00:21:27.653
ALSO THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE
WOULD LIKE TO GO TO THEIR LOCAL

00:21:27.719 --> 00:21:30.956
HEALTH CLINIC AND BE ABLE TO
GET THE SERVICES WHERE EVERYONE

00:21:31.023 --> 00:21:34.926
ELSE DOES SO I THINK THERE'S A
LOT OF NEED FOR MORE TRAINING

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:39.297
MORE EXPERTISE OIL ALL OVER THE
STATE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR

00:21:39.364 --> 00:21:42.267
THAT AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS
I'VE RUN ACROSS IN KIND OF THE

00:21:42.334 --> 00:21:45.137
TRAVELS AND TALKING TO SOME
OF THE MEMBERS THE POPULATION

00:21:45.203 --> 00:21:48.640
IS SOME KIND OF RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE HEALTH PLANS IN THE

00:21:48.707 --> 00:21:53.011
REGIONAL CENTERS WORD YOU'RE
THE ADVOCATE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL

00:21:53.078 --> 00:21:55.313
TO THE HEALTH PLANS JUST
SEEMS LIKE WHAT I'M HEARING

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:59.051
IS THAT YOU TELL THEM THAT IN
IDENTIFIED THAT THEY HAVE AN

00:21:59.117 --> 00:22:02.020
ABILITY TO GO TO THEIR HEALTH
PLAN BUT THEN IT'S JUST A KIND

00:22:02.087 --> 00:22:06.258
OF A -- HAND OFTEN NO REAL
ADVOCACY AT THAT AFTER THAT

00:22:06.324 --> 00:22:09.961
POINT CAN WE LOOK AT SOMETHING
THAT WOULD BE UP FACILITATED

00:22:10.028 --> 00:22:13.799
AND I KNOW IT'S SOME IT'S
ABOUT IT MANPOWER AND ONE BUT

00:22:13.865 --> 00:22:17.469
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IF WE HAVE
A SINGLE PARENT WHO'S TRYING

00:22:17.536 --> 00:22:22.007
TO STAY OF OF FLOAT WITH THEIR
EMPLOYMENT DOESN'T HAVE THE

00:22:22.074 --> 00:22:25.944
ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE ALL OF THE
BUREAUCRACY THAT HEALTH PLANS

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:29.481
HAVE ALSO AND SO I'M LOOKING
TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT ALSO

00:22:29.548 --> 00:22:33.852
BECAUSE RIGHT SERIOUSLY I
AGREE I THINK THERE ARE SO MANY

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:37.789
LAYERS OF GENERIC RESOURCES
THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO ACCESS IT'S

00:22:37.856 --> 00:22:42.494
AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX SITUATION
AS IS PRIVATE INSURANCE SO I'D

00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:46.364
LOVE TO WORK ON THE ISSUE WE
DEVELOPED A GOOD RELATIONSHIP

00:22:46.431 --> 00:22:50.936
WITH CONTRA COSTA HEALTH PLAN
AS WE TRANSITION PEOPLE FROM

00:22:51.002 --> 00:22:55.774
AB A FUNDED BY REGIONAL CENTERS
TO AB A FUNDED THROUGH THE

00:22:55.841 --> 00:22:59.511
HEALTH PLANS BUT THAT WAS THE
ONE HEALTH PLAN THE REALLY DID

00:22:59.578 --> 00:23:04.583
AN OUTSTANDING JOB NOT OLD DID
AS WELL AND IT DOESN'T ALWAYS

00:23:04.649 --> 00:23:08.386
HAPPEN SO I I WOULD LIKE TO
WORK ON THE ISSUE BUT IT WILL

00:23:08.453 --> 00:23:12.057
TAKE CASE MANAGEMENT RATIOS
ARE OTHER WAYS OF SERVING

00:23:12.124 --> 00:23:15.393
PEOPLE AND GETTING ACCESS AND
UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN YOU

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.897
TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW RETENTION
OF EMPLOYMENT FOR YOUR THROUGH

00:23:18.964 --> 00:23:22.467
YOUR FOLKS AND AND HAVING
AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF CASE

00:23:22.534 --> 00:23:28.673
MANAGERS YES MOVING FORWARD OF
WHEN YOU HAVE OF YOUR PROVIDERS

00:23:29.808 --> 00:23:33.211
IS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S
A WAITING LIST BECAUSE OF OF

00:23:33.278 --> 00:23:37.415
-- BASICALLY THE WAY THE STATE
HAS PROVIDED THE RESOURCES HALF

00:23:37.482 --> 00:23:40.819
THE BUILDING THE THE FURLOUGHS
AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO WE'RE

00:23:40.886 --> 00:23:44.623
LOSING PROVIDERS AND NOW THE
CLIENTS ARE COSTS CONSUMERS

00:23:44.689 --> 00:23:48.560
ARE BEING MADE TO WAIT YES
ACTION ACTUALLY WHY A MET WITH

00:23:48.627 --> 00:23:52.497
A SERVICE PROVIDER YESTERDAY
WHO TOLD ME THAT EVERY TIME

00:23:52.564 --> 00:23:56.334
HE HAS A CONSUMER LEAVE HIS
PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY MOVE

00:23:56.401 --> 00:24:01.006
FOR OTHER THINGS HAPPEN HE
CANNOT FILL THAT SLOT BECAUSE

00:24:01.072 --> 00:24:04.509
HE STILL DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH
STAFFING SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE

00:24:04.576 --> 00:24:08.146
THIS BECAUSE OF THE RATES AND
BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMY IN THIS

00:24:08.213 --> 00:24:12.250
AREA HE JUST CAN'T TAKE ON IN
THE PEOPLE EVEN TO BACK FILL

00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:16.221
SOME SLUTTY USED TO HAVE A
PROGRAM GERMANY NUMBERS ON HOW

00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:19.524
MANY CONSUMERS YOU HAVE WAITING
FOR SERVICES YOU KNOW THAT'S A

00:24:19.591 --> 00:24:25.197
HARD THING TO LOOK AT BECAUSE
I THINK SOME PEOPLE HAVE

00:24:25.263 --> 00:24:28.433
GIVEN UP A LITTLE BIT BUT IT'S
CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE COULD

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.504
LOOK AT WE DID HAVE SOME DAY
SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO LOOKED

00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:35.173
AT HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY HAD
ON THEIR WAITING LIST BUT IT'S

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.578
A LITTLE OFF BECAUSE PEOPLE
CAN BE ON MULTIPLE WAITING

00:24:39.644 --> 00:24:42.347
LESSON OF THE OTHER THING IS
IT WOULD WOULD HELP VALIDATE

00:24:42.414 --> 00:24:45.350

NEED TO ENABLE TO SUPPORT IT

FOR A BA SERVICES I'LL GIVE
YOU A LITTLE -- JUST A QUICK

00:25:54.686 --> 00:25:58.223
ABA ABA IS APPLIED BEHAVIOR
ANALYSIS IT'S SCIENCE BASED

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:02.193
THERAPY WORKING ON BEHAVES OF
CHILDREN OUR CLIENTS ANY AGE SO

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.763
WE GO INTO THE HOMES WE TALK TO
THE PARENTS WE FIND OUT THEIR

00:26:04.829 --> 00:26:08.466
CONCERNS WE REALLY GET A SENSE
OF WHAT WOULD IMPROVE THEIR

00:26:08.533 --> 00:26:11.136
LIVES THE QUALITY OF THEIR
LIVES AND THEIR CHILD'S LIVES

00:26:11.202 --> 00:26:13.672
WE DO YOU USE ASSESSMENT TOOLS
AND WE COME UP WITH A VERY

00:26:13.738 --> 00:26:17.309
INDIVIDUALIZED PROGRAM FOR THAT
CLIENT SO WHAT WE'RE FACING

00:26:17.375 --> 00:26:20.578
NOW THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES
AND IT'S FAIRLY RECENT WITH

00:26:20.645 --> 00:26:24.015
THE INSURANCE PAYERS IS THERE
TRYING TO AGE OUT OUR CLIENTS

00:26:24.082 --> 00:26:26.551
HAD A MUCH YOUNGER AGE WE'RE
GETTING AUTHORIZED FOR LESS

00:26:26.618 --> 00:26:29.721
HOURS AND WERE HAVING TO
FIGHT HARDER FOR THOSE HOURS

00:26:29.788 --> 00:26:32.257
SO TYPICALLY WE WOULD GET
ANYWHERE FROM THIRTEEN AND A

00:26:32.324 --> 00:26:34.960
HALF TO FIFTEEN TO EIGHTEEN
HOURS A MONTH IS A SUPER IS

00:26:35.026 --> 00:26:37.462
LEVEL NOW ALL THE REPORTS THAT
WERE SUBMITTING THEIR OWN AND

00:26:37.529 --> 00:26:40.298
ONLY APPROVING SIX SO IT'S
REALLY LIMITING WHAT WE CAN

00:26:40.365 --> 00:26:44.436
DO FOR THOSE CLIENTS AND FOR
THE AGING OUT PROCESS YOU KNOW

00:26:44.502 --> 00:26:46.938
IT'S JUST WE DISAGREE WITH
THAT STRONGLY AND ARE REALLY

00:26:47.005 --> 00:26:50.175
HAVING TO PUSH BACK IN ORDER
TO CONTINUE SERVICES IT'S VERY

00:26:50.241 --> 00:26:53.411
DATABASE THE A BA AND SO WE
HAVE WE HAVE THE RATIONALE THE

00:26:53.478 --> 00:26:55.747
CLINICAL RATIONALE AND WE HAVE
THE DATA THAT SHOWS THAT WE ARE

00:26:55.814 --> 00:26:58.616
CONTINUING TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS
TO THE QUALITY THE LIVES OF THE

00:26:58.683 --> 00:27:01.720
CLIENTS AND FOR THE FAMILIES
WHICH IS WHY WE'RE IN THIS AND

00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:04.923
FOR THEM TO BE PUSHING BACK
AND LIMITING THOSE ANY CHILD

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:08.093
OVER THE AGE OF FIFTEEN THEY
NOW WANT TO TRANSITION PLAN

00:27:08.159 --> 00:27:10.929
SOME OF THESE CLIENTS WE DON'T
GET INTO THEIR FOURTEEN AND SO

00:27:10.996 --> 00:27:13.198
THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE CAN GIVE
A TRANSITION PLAN SO THAT'S OUR

00:27:13.264 --> 00:27:17.635
BIGGEST STRUGGLE RIGHT NOW THE
OTHER THING IS IS -- COPAYS OF

00:27:17.702 --> 00:27:20.972
THE BIG ONE SO WE HAVE FAMILIES
WHO ARE UNABLE TO RECEIVE OUR

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:23.541
SERVICES BECAUSE OF THE COPAYS
ATTACHED TO THAT WHEN YOU

00:27:23.608 --> 00:27:26.144
THINK ABOUT IT WE MIGHT HAVE
A CLIENT THAT RECEIVE SERVICES

00:27:26.211 --> 00:27:28.913
FIVE DAYS A WEEK THEY HAVE TO
HAVE THE FAMILY PAY THE CO PAY

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.850
FOR EVERY TIME WE'RE IN THE
HOME CASE THAT'S A STRUGGLE

00:27:31.916 --> 00:27:34.419
AND SCHISM FAMILIES REFUSE
SERVICES BECAUSE OF THAT WE

00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:37.155
DO NOT WANT TO SEE THAT THAT
BREAKS OUR HEARTS THE OWNER

00:27:37.222 --> 00:27:40.358
OF THE COMPANY THAT I WORK FOR
HAS CREATED A FOUNDATION AND

00:27:40.425 --> 00:27:43.395
WE'RE AS WE FUNDRAISE FOR THAT
FOUNDATION WHICH IS SEPARATE

00:27:43.461 --> 00:27:45.864
FROM THE ACTUAL COMPANY YOU
KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:48.967
THAT'S GOING TO BE USED FORCE
TO HELP FAMILIES A CO PAYS OKAY

00:27:49.034 --> 00:27:52.037
WE WANT TO FIND SOLUTIONS AND
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS

00:27:52.103 --> 00:27:55.206
OR TRYING TO CREATE OUR OWN --
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT

00:27:55.273 --> 00:27:59.144
WE WORRY ABOUT WITH OUR CLIENTS
IS AS THE -- AS THEIR A TRYING

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:03.748
TO AGE OUT OUR CLIENTS AT A
VERY EARLY AGE WE HAD A MEETING

00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:06.451
RECENTLY AND ONE OF THE PAIRS
REPRESENTED THE PAIR SAID TO

00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:09.320
US EVERY CLIENT OVER THE AGE OF
SEVENTEEN SHOULD BE SERVICED BY

00:28:09.387 --> 00:28:12.290
THE REGIONAL CENTERS BUT IT'S
SUCH A FAR CRY FROM THE REALITY

00:28:12.357 --> 00:28:15.260
THAT WE FACE EVERY DAY EVERY
DAY WE SEE PARENTS WHO ARE

00:28:15.326 --> 00:28:18.430
DENIED SERVICES FROM REGIONAL
CENTERS I SEE INCONSISTENCIES

00:28:18.496 --> 00:28:20.331
FROM ONE REGIONAL CENTER TO
ANOTHER AND WE WORK WITH SO

00:28:20.398 --> 00:28:24.102
MANY AND IN THE REGION I COVER
A LOAN AND SOME ARE GREAT

00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:27.138
AND AND THE CLIENTS ARE ARE
GETTING THOSE CO PAY ASSISTANCE

00:28:27.205 --> 00:28:29.374
AND THEY'RE GETTING RESPITE
SERVICES AND OTHER ONES ARE

00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:34.045
DENIED -- SUMMER DENIED BECAUSE
THEY DENY THEIR DIAGNOSIS WHEN

00:28:34.112 --> 00:28:37.048
THE DIAGNOSIS ACTUALLY CAME
FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY DOWN

00:28:37.115 --> 00:28:40.351
WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT SOMETIMES A
CLAIM IS DENIED BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:28:40.418 --> 00:28:43.788
CONSIDERED NOT IMPACTED ENOUGH
WHEN WE KNOW BECAUSE WE WORK

00:28:43.855 --> 00:28:45.824
WITH THAT PLAN THAT WE CAN'T
EVEN TAKE THAT CLIENT INTO

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:48.560
THE COMMUNITY WITHOUT BEING
A HARNESS PHYSICALLY BECAUSE

00:28:48.626 --> 00:28:54.632
IT'S SUCH A DANGER OKAY SO IT
DOESN'T DOESN'T MAKE SENSE --

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:57.035
SOME OF THE THINGS WE'VE REALLY
BEEN STRUGGLING WITH DEFINITELY

00:28:57.102 --> 00:29:00.505
IN CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHICS IS A
COMBINATION OF DUAL DIAGNOSIS

00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:03.441
SO WE USED WE ARE TRAINED TO
DEAL WITH AUTISM BUT WE'RE

00:29:03.508 --> 00:29:06.244
GETTING SO MANY EXPRESSLY WITH
OUR YOUNGER TEENS THAT HAVE

00:29:06.311 --> 00:29:09.914
A DUAL DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM
AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WE

00:29:09.981 --> 00:29:13.518
ARE NOT TRAINED TO WORK WITH
THOSE KIDS BUT WE WILL NOT

00:29:13.585 --> 00:29:16.354
NOT SERVICE THOSE KIDS WILL
DO OUR BEST BUT WHEN WE MEET

00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:18.656
WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANY
HAVE A CLINICAL CONSULTATION

00:29:18.723 --> 00:29:21.960
AND EXPLAIN OUR SERVICES
ARE NOT HELPING THIS CLIENT

00:29:22.026 --> 00:29:24.429
THEY MAY BE HEARING VOICES
THEY MAY BE HAVING ALL THESE

00:29:24.496 --> 00:29:27.932
DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT'S NOT A
BE A SERVICES BUT THE CLINIC

00:29:27.999 --> 00:29:30.735
THE CLINICAL TEAM FROM THE
INSURANCE PAYER WILL COME BACK

00:29:30.802 --> 00:29:33.538
AT US AND SAY YOU'RE THE ONLY
OPTION YOU'RE ALL THAT THERE

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:36.474
IS FOR THE FAMILY WE'VE GONE
THROUGH EVERYTHING ELSE WELL WE

00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:39.344
WON'T STOP PROVIDING SERVICES
BECAUSE WE WANT THE FAMILY DOWN

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.846
SO WE STILL GO IN THERE EVERY
DAY NOT NECESSARILY HAVING THE

00:29:41.913 --> 00:29:44.382
KNOWLEDGE OR THE TRAINING TO
TO REALLY HELP WE DO THE BEST

00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:48.586
THAT WE CAN WE HAVE FAMILIES
THAT WILL DENY SERVICES

00:29:48.653 --> 00:29:51.890
BECAUSE -- OF DIFFERENT CUSTOMS
YOU KNOW SO DIFFERENT FOR

00:29:51.956 --> 00:29:55.059
DIFFERENT CULTURES HAVE THEIR
VERY DIFFERENT BELIEFS AND

00:29:55.126 --> 00:29:58.997
SOMETIMES THERE'S A SHAME WITH
A DIAGNOSIS AND FAMILIES WON'T

00:29:59.063 --> 00:30:00.965
LET US INTO THE HOMES BECAUSE
THEY DON'T WANT THE NEIGHBORS

00:30:01.032 --> 00:30:02.700
WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS
OR FRIENDS TO KNOW THERE'S

00:30:02.767 --> 00:30:06.004
ANYTHING WRONG HOW DO WE REACH
THOSE FAMILIES HOW DO WE BRIDGE

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:08.907
THAT HOW DO WE EMPOWER THOSE
FAMILIES WELL BEING CULTURALLY

00:30:08.973 --> 00:30:12.243
SENSITIVE TOOK KNOWLEDGE
THE BENEFIT THAT WE CAN GET

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:15.947
WE HAVE CERTAIN CULTURES
THAT ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:18.950
ON ACADEMICS AND THEY DON'T
UNDERSTAND THE VALUE FOR TRYING

00:30:19.017 --> 00:30:21.319
TO TEACH THEIR CHILD TO HAVE
RECIPROCAL CONVERSATION SO THEY

00:30:21.386 --> 00:30:23.955
CAN INTERACT WITH PEERS AND
COLLEAGUES LATER IN LIFE HOW

00:30:24.022 --> 00:30:28.059
DO WE EDUCATE THE PARENTS ARE
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I IT WE

00:30:28.126 --> 00:30:30.428
NEED TO LOOK AT AS WERE AGING
IS CLIENTS OUT IS WHERE DO THEY

00:30:30.495 --> 00:30:33.398
GO YOU KNOW THE PAIR JUST SAYS
THE FAMILIES NEED TO FIGURE IT

00:30:33.464 --> 00:30:36.367
OUT IT'S NOT FAIR THE FAMILIES
AND THAT'S NOT HOW WE DO THINGS

00:30:36.434 --> 00:30:38.803
OF THE COMPANY WE WILL NOT
LET THIS PARENTS STRUGGLE WILL

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.673
DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER
WE'RE NOT CASE MANAGERS SO

00:30:41.739 --> 00:30:44.075
HOW DO WE GET MORE KNOWLEDGE
ABOUT WHAT IS AVAILABLE AT THE

00:30:44.142 --> 00:30:45.977
DIFFERENT REGIONAL CENTERS IN
THE DIFFERENT LEVELS IN THE

00:30:46.044 --> 00:30:49.914
RESOURCES FOR THOSE FAMILIES IN
ORDER TO CONTINUE SERVICES FOR

00:30:49.981 --> 00:30:53.051
THEM EVEN IF WE CAN'T BE THE
ONES TO DO IT SO THOSE ARE JUST

00:30:53.117 --> 00:30:56.421
SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE
FACE ON A DAILY BASIS I THINK

00:30:56.487 --> 00:30:58.489
A LOT OF IT IS GOING TO COME
DOWN TO FUNDING AND IT'S GOING

00:30:58.556 --> 00:31:00.959
TO BE THE REGIONAL CENTERS WE
HAVE THE ANSWERS FOR THAT YOU

00:31:01.025 --> 00:31:03.728
KNOW THEY HAVE THEIR SET UP
TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES AND

00:31:03.795 --> 00:31:05.730
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE
THE MONEY TO DO THAT FOR OUR

00:31:05.797 --> 00:31:08.566
CLIENTS AND WE NEED TO BRIDGES
YOU WERE DISCUSSING EARLIER THE

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:11.736
BRIDGE BETWEEN THINGS LIKE ABA
SERVICES AND REGIONAL CENTERS

00:31:11.803 --> 00:31:14.505
HOW DO WE HOW DO WE BRIDGE
THAT GAP BECAUSE THERE'S A HUGE

00:31:14.572 --> 00:31:16.541
ALL RIGHT NOW THERE'S A HUGE
ASSUMPTION FROM THE PAYERS THE

00:31:16.608 --> 00:31:19.877
INSURANCE PAIRS THE REGIONAL
CENTERS TAKING OVER AND THAT'S

00:31:19.944 --> 00:31:22.747
NOT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING SO
HOW DO WE MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND

00:31:22.814 --> 00:31:26.317
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO FUNDING
YOU KNOW -- THAT'S PRETTY

00:31:26.384 --> 00:31:33.558
MUCH HOW I HAD YEAH MR LOW ANY
QUESTIONS IN THE STRIP K.

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:39.364
FLOOR I DON'T GET IT THIS
GRAYSON JUST REAL QUICK --

00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:44.402
ON YOUR LAST POINT HOW WOULD
FUNDING JUST GIVE ME AN IDEA

00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:47.739
HOW WOULD FUNDING HOPE THAT
TRIP -- THE COLLABORATION

00:31:47.805 --> 00:31:50.742
BETWEEN AB SERVICES AND
REGIONAL CENTERS BECAUSE RIGHT

00:31:50.808 --> 00:31:54.045
NOW FOR NOT UNDERSTANDING
ALL THE THINGS THE REGIONAL

00:31:54.112 --> 00:31:56.681
SERVICES OFFER AND I THINK
THEY DON'T ALWAYS VOLUNTEER

00:31:56.748 --> 00:31:58.650
THAT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE
THE FUNDS TO PROVIDE THE

00:31:58.716 --> 00:32:00.618
SERVICES THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO PROVIDE SO I THINK BY

00:32:00.685 --> 00:32:03.354
INCREASING THE FUNDING BILL
INCREASE THE ABILITY AND WEEK

00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:05.723
THEY CAN BETTER ADVERTISEMENT
THESE PARENTS KNOW WHAT IS

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:08.326
AVAILABLE AND I THINK THEY'LL
BE MORE CONSISTENCY IF THEY

00:32:08.393 --> 00:32:10.828
HAVE MORE FUNDS THEY COULD BE
MORE CONSISTENT FROM REGIONAL

00:32:10.895 --> 00:32:14.632
CENTER REGIONAL CENTER TO WHAT
THEY OFFER I JUST ATHLETES THAT

00:32:14.699 --> 00:32:17.568
DOES THE REGIONAL CENTER HELP
COVER COPAYS AND SHE SAID YES

00:32:17.635 --> 00:32:20.004
AND I SAID MY CLIENTS AREN'T
GETTING THAT AND SHE SAID IT'S

00:32:20.071 --> 00:32:23.474
NOT FROM THIS AREA IS IT AND
I SAID NO MY CLIENTS ARE FROM

00:32:23.541 --> 00:32:26.678
SOLANO COUNTY NAPA COUNTY AND
THE REGIONAL CENTER THERE HAS

00:32:26.744 --> 00:32:29.514
NOT BEEN COVERING THAT SO HOW
DO WE GET CONSISTENCY WELL

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:34.585
MAYBE IF THEY HAVE MORE FUNDING
THEY'LL IMPLEMENT THAT OCT

00:32:34.986 --> 00:32:40.024
AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT YOU
BEING A SERVICE PROVIDER ARE

00:32:40.091 --> 00:32:44.295
YOU WORKING DIRECTLY WITH
THE REGIONAL CENTERS WE ARE

00:32:44.362 --> 00:32:46.631
WORKING WITH A COUPLE REGIONAL
CENTERS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF

00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:50.601
CALIFORNIA -- WE'VE BEEN TRYING
TO GET BEEN DRIES VÀ THROUGH --

00:32:50.668 --> 00:32:53.237
NORTH BAY REGIONAL CENTER AND
IT HASN'T HAPPENED FOR REASONS

00:32:53.304 --> 00:32:56.641
THAT I'M NOT SURE BECAUSE I'M
NOT PART OF THAT PROCESS SO IS

00:32:56.708 --> 00:33:00.445
THERE WE CAN FOLLOW UP ON THAT
AFTER THE AFTER THE -- MEETING

00:33:00.511 --> 00:33:04.315
BUT SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS
YOU'RE YOU'RE READY WILLING AND

00:33:04.382 --> 00:33:07.752
ABLE TO GO DO AND IF THERE'S
A WAITING LIST THE NORTH BAY

00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:11.556
HAS WE HAVE A WE HAVE THE
ABILITY TO TAKE THOSE CLIENTS

00:33:11.622 --> 00:33:14.425
WE HAVE THE REALLY I HAVE THE
ABILITY IT'S MY JOB TO GROW

00:33:14.492 --> 00:33:16.961
THE COMPANY AND I HAVE THAT
ABILITY AND WE ABSOLUTELY WANT

00:33:17.028 --> 00:33:20.064
THOSE CLIENTS NOW SOMETIMES
THE PAY RATES ARE AN ISSUE AND

00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:22.767
THAT DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE
LOOKED AT BUT YES I HAVE THE

00:33:22.834 --> 00:33:25.503
ABILITY BECAUSE CLIENTS WE HAVE
LIKE ABA COMPANY DO NOT HAVE

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:28.005
A WAITING LIST WE DON'T TAKE
CLIENTS UNLESS WE CAN PROVIDE

00:33:28.072 --> 00:33:31.609
THOSE SERVICES WE NEVER SAY
NO AND PLEASE SAID MENTION

00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:36.147
SOMETHING ABOUT LANGUAGE
BARRIERS AND AND YOU TOUCHED

00:33:36.214 --> 00:33:40.551
ON THE CULTURAL ISSUES BUT
-- THE THE LANGUAGE BARRIERS

00:33:40.618 --> 00:33:47.058
AND AND THE -- HERE IMMIGRANT
STATUS KIND OF HAS BEEN A AN

00:33:47.125 --> 00:33:51.729
ISSUE THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM IN
THE PAST HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH

00:33:51.796 --> 00:33:57.835
THE -- THE IMMIGRANT OF WHO
IS AFRAID OF BEING DEPORTED

00:33:57.902 --> 00:34:02.640
OR OF OF RECEIVING SERVICES
WE HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF THAT

00:34:02.707 --> 00:34:05.309
BECAUSE IN ORDER I THINK THEY
HAVE TO OBVIOUSLY BE A CERTAIN

00:34:05.376 --> 00:34:07.612
SHOW SOMETHING TO GET THE
INSURANCE BECAUSE UNLESS THEY

00:34:07.678 --> 00:34:10.915
HAVE INSURANCE THEY DON'T COME
TO US -- I KNOW THAT WE HAVE

00:34:10.982 --> 00:34:13.418
HAD FAMILIES THAT HAVE HAD TO
LEAVE THE COUNTRY THEIR CHILD

00:34:13.484 --> 00:34:16.721
WAS OF AMERICAN CITIZEN BUT
THEY WERE NOT THEIR CHILD DID

00:34:16.788 --> 00:34:19.123
HAVE COVERAGE RECEIVE SERVICES
BUT THEN THEY HAD TO LEAVE

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:22.627
THE COUNTRY AND TAKE THE CHILD
WITH THEM SO YEAH WE DO FACE

00:34:22.693 --> 00:34:27.865
THAT WAS RISEN THANK YOU CHAIR
IDEA -- I WILL GO BACK TO THE

00:34:27.932 --> 00:34:31.002
QUESTION OF MY COLLEAGUE ASKED
ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW OF FOR

00:34:31.068 --> 00:34:35.907
THE FIRST PRESENTER IS THERE
AN AREA WHERE YOU SEE FUNDING

00:34:35.973 --> 00:34:39.343
THAT COULD BE BETTER USED IN
OTHER WORDS HOW DO YOU SEE THE

00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:42.113
FUNDING OR WHERE DO YOU SEE
THE FUNDING COMING FROM I THINK

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:45.616
THAT'S KIND OF HOW YOU AS IS
-- IS THERE AN AREA WHERE YOU

00:34:45.683 --> 00:34:48.820
SEE FUNDING NOT BEING USED AT
ITS MOST EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE

00:34:48.886 --> 00:34:54.025
WAY THAT YOU THINK IF WE RE
DIRECTED IT IT WOULD BE BETTER

00:34:54.091 --> 00:34:56.861
HONESTLY NO I DON'T BUT THEN
I'M VERY I'M LIMITED MORE

00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:59.831
LIMITED IN THE ABA COMMUNITY OR
ALL THE MONEY TYPICALLY COMES

00:34:59.897 --> 00:35:03.401
FROM OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES
DOUBT BUT I DEFINITELY ALSO IN

00:35:03.468 --> 00:35:06.037
TOUCH ON THE FACT THAT SO MUCH
OF WHAT SOME OF OUR CLIENTS YOU

00:35:06.103 --> 00:35:08.840
KNOW THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION THAT
FROM THE PAYERS THAT THERE ARE

00:35:08.906 --> 00:35:11.976
GROUP HOMES AND THERE ARE DAY
PROGRAMS AND THEIR JOB TRAINING

00:35:12.043 --> 00:35:15.246
FOR THESE CLIENTS AND THERE'S
NOT THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO SEE

00:35:15.313 --> 00:35:18.716
A LOT MORE THE FUNDING GO --
IT BREAKS MY HEART WHEN I HAVE

00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:21.452
TO CONVINCE ONE OF MY CLIENTS
TO BE OKAY WITH SWEEPING FLOORS

00:35:21.519 --> 00:35:23.654
WHEN THEY WERE DETERMINED WHEN
THEY WENT OUT IN THE JOB MARKET

00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:26.457
THEY'RE GONNA BE WORKING IN
TECH OR VIDEO GAMES YOU KNOW

00:35:26.524 --> 00:35:28.526
AND THE OPPORTUNITIES AREN'T
THERE I DON'T WANT THAT TO

00:35:28.593 --> 00:35:33.264
HAPPEN THAT DAYS BE BIG CHANGE
AND JOB TRAINING MR LOOK AT

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:35.666
I THINK THAT'S A PART OF THE
COMMENTS IN THE OBSERVATION

00:35:35.733 --> 00:35:39.070
THAT WE RELY ON INDIVIDUALS
LIKE YOURSELVES TO PROVIDE US

00:35:39.136 --> 00:35:42.640
YOUR INSIGHTS IN A LEVEL OF
EXPERTISE TO HELP US IDENTIFY

00:35:42.707 --> 00:35:46.010
ADDITIONAL REVENUES BECAUSE
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WE HAVE

00:35:46.077 --> 00:35:49.080
COMPETING INTERESTS I JUST CAME
BACK FROM ANOTHER FUNCTION IN

00:35:49.146 --> 00:35:52.316
WHICH A SPEAKING TO COMMUNITY
COLLEGES AND ASSIMILATE

00:35:52.383 --> 00:35:54.552
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE'S
NEVER ENOUGH MONEY FOR HIGHER

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:57.955
EDUCATION AND WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT THESE VARIOUS ISSUES

00:35:58.022 --> 00:36:01.526
HOW DO WE LOOK FOR ADDITIONAL
REVENUES -- AND OR EXISTING

00:36:01.592 --> 00:36:04.829
REVENUES TO BE MORE EFFICIENT
AND SERVING -- SIGNIFICANT

00:36:04.896 --> 00:36:07.365
POPULATIONS AND THINK THAT'S
THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION

00:36:07.431 --> 00:36:11.702
THAT WE WANT TO COLLECTIVELY
AS A WHOLE ONE TO -- IS TRY TO

00:36:11.769 --> 00:36:15.206
SOLVE AND AND DO THIS TOGETHER
AS WELL EXCELLENT THANK YOU SO

00:36:15.273 --> 00:36:17.942
I JUST HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION
OR SO WE HAVE AN I.

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:18.175
E.

00:36:18.242 --> 00:36:19.210
P.

00:36:19.277 --> 00:36:22.480
WE HAVE AN I PP SERVICE
PROVIDERS DOING A COMPONENT

00:36:22.547 --> 00:36:27.752
OF OF THE APA BUT WE ALSO HAVE
THE EDUCATIONAL DO YOU BELIEVE

00:36:27.818 --> 00:36:32.924
IN YOUR EXPERIENCES THAT THE
THE PROVIDERS AND THE SCHOOLS

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:35.726
SHOULD ACTUALLY COME TOGETHER
FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THAT

00:36:35.793 --> 00:36:38.262
CHILD SUCCESS ABSOLUTELY I'M
REALLY GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT

00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:41.198
UP THAT'S A HUGE STRUGGLE THAT
WE HAVE -- THE SCHOOLS FEEL

00:36:41.265 --> 00:36:43.434
THAT EVEN THOUGH WE'RE IN THE
HOME SETTING AND WE'RE TRYING

00:36:43.501 --> 00:36:46.537
TO CREATE ALL THESE SKILLS IN
THE CHILD WOULD MAKE SENSE THAT

00:36:46.604 --> 00:36:48.272
WE SHOULD GO INTO THE SCHOOL
SETTING TO SEE WHERE THEY

00:36:48.339 --> 00:36:51.042
STRUGGLE THEY'RE AN OFFER THE
SAME SERVICES BUT IF THE THIS

00:36:51.108 --> 00:36:53.878
PAY YOUR SAY THAT IF THE CHILD
HAS AN IEP WE'RE NOT ALLOWED

00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:56.914
IN THE SCHOOL SETTING AND YOU
KNOW IT AND UNFORTUNATELY THE

00:36:56.981 --> 00:37:00.117
SCHOOLS AREN'T THEY THEY FEEL
THE SCHOOLS TO BE RESPONSIBLE

00:37:00.184 --> 00:37:03.788
FOR PROVIDING WHATEVER'S IN
THAT I YOU PETE -- THE REALITY

00:37:03.854 --> 00:37:05.856
IS THOSE KIDS ARE GETTING
SUPPORT THEY NEED MOST OF

00:37:05.923 --> 00:37:08.859
OUR CLIENTS STRUGGLE THE MOST
OF BEING BULLIED AT DURING

00:37:08.926 --> 00:37:12.096
RECESS AND DURING LUNCH TIME
AND DURING PEAK FOR SUMMER

00:37:12.163 --> 00:37:14.465
OLDER ONES THOSE ARE THE MOST
THERE'S A TIMES A STRUGGLE

00:37:14.532 --> 00:37:17.501
THE MOST SO SOMETIMES WE CAN
KIND OF PLAY LET'S MAKE A

00:37:17.568 --> 00:37:20.538
DEAL WITH THE PAIR AND SAY WE
ONLY GO FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES

00:37:20.605 --> 00:37:23.174
DURING UNSTRUCTURED SCHOOL
TIME CAN WE GO IN THERE AND

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:26.644
ASSIST THEM CAN WE HELP FORGE
SOME PEER INTERACTIONS CAN

00:37:26.711 --> 00:37:29.914
WE TEACH THEM SOME POSITIVE
-- PEER INTERACTIONS YOU KNOW

00:37:29.981 --> 00:37:32.316
AND BUILD THAT UP FOR THEM AND
EVERYONE SO WHILE WE GET IN

00:37:32.383 --> 00:37:34.719
THERE PARENTS OFTEN REQUEST
THAT WE GO TO THE I.

00:37:34.785 --> 00:37:34.885
E.

00:37:34.952 --> 00:37:35.987
P.

00:37:36.053 --> 00:37:37.521
A SUPPORT FOR THEM IT WOULD
MAKE SENSE FOR CONTINUING OF

00:37:37.588 --> 00:37:40.791
SERVICES TO BE ABLE TO HEAR HOW
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO SCHOOL

00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:44.095
SETTING SEE WHERE THE STRUGGLE
IS BRING THOSE INTO THE HOME

00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:46.998
TO WORK ON AND THEN GENERALIZE
AND OTHER SETTINGS AND IT'S

00:37:47.064 --> 00:37:51.035
JUST TOO HARD TO GET IN THERE
THEY JUST WON'T LET US YEAH

00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:53.371
WHAT IS THE BIGGEST HANG UP
ON THE ECONOMY SERVICES SEEMS

00:37:53.437 --> 00:37:56.874
LIKE A VERY ELEMENTARY THING
THAT THAT I MEAN THROUGHOUT

00:37:56.941 --> 00:38:01.278
THIS THAT SHOULD BE LIKE NUMBER
ONE RIGHT I MEAN WE SEE KIDS

00:38:01.345 --> 00:38:03.881
TIME AND TIME AGAIN THEY GO
TO SCHOOL THEY'RE DOING VERY

00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:06.083
WELL IN THE GOING TO ANOTHER
SETTING IN THE FALL OFF THE

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:09.053
TREE OR OR VICE VERSA WHAT IS
THE BIGGEST -- HURDLE TO GET

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.922
OVER WHO'S WHO HAS THE BIGGEST
ISSUE WITH THAT IS THAT THE

00:38:11.989 --> 00:38:14.058
SCHOOL SYSTEM THEY DON'T WANT
PEOPLE LOOKING UNDER THE TENT

00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:16.460
THEY GOT THEIR OWN PROGRAMS
YOU KNOW IT REALLY VARIES FROM

00:38:16.527 --> 00:38:18.829
SCHOOL TO SCHOOL SOME SCHOOLS
ARE SO PLEASE THAT WE'RE IN

00:38:18.896 --> 00:38:21.732
THERE AND AND JUST WELCOME
US WITH OPEN ARMS AND OTHER

00:38:21.799 --> 00:38:24.869
SCHOOLS WILL NOT ALLOW US IN
THERE I HAD I WORKED DIRECTLY

00:38:24.935 --> 00:38:27.438
WITH THE CLIENT IN A MIDDLE
SCHOOL IN NAPA AND I WAS ONLY

00:38:27.505 --> 00:38:30.341
ALLOWED FOR THIRTY MINUTES AT
A TIME SUPERVISED AND SO THERE

00:38:30.408 --> 00:38:32.977
WAS REALLY NOTHING I COULD DO
WITH MY CLIENT THEY AND I'M

00:38:33.044 --> 00:38:35.379
NOT SURE WHAT THEIR HANG UP WAS
AND WE'VE WE'VE DEALT WITH THAT

00:38:35.446 --> 00:38:38.783
MULTIPLE SCHOOL SINCE THEN --
I THINK MAYBE THEY THINK THAT

00:38:38.849 --> 00:38:41.886
WE'RE GOING IN THERE TO SHOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING WRONG WHEN

00:38:41.952 --> 00:38:44.689
THAT COURSE NOT OUR INTENT AT
ALL WE'RE JUST THERE TO SUPPORT

00:38:44.755 --> 00:38:50.494
THE CLIENTS BUT -- YEAH I THINK
I THINK YOU HAVE TO DO THE

00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:53.431
PAYER DOES NOT WANT US TO SAY
OR DO ANYTHING REPRESENTING

00:38:53.497 --> 00:38:55.733
THEM AND THEY'RE THE ONES
PAYING FOR THE SERVICES I THINK

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.335
THAT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH
IT THE SCHOOL YOU KNOW AND THE

00:38:58.402 --> 00:39:00.571
PAIR FEELS LIKE THE SCHOOLS BE
RESPONSIBLE IF THERE'S AN AYE

00:39:00.638 --> 00:39:04.141
YOU PM PLACE THEY'RE OFF THE
HOOK BECAUSE IT'S THE SCHOOL'S

00:39:04.208 --> 00:39:07.311
RESPONSIBILITY WE JUST NOW AS
AND AS FAMILIES NO THIS IS NOT

00:39:07.378 --> 00:39:12.850
THE CASE YEAH SO DEALING WITH
IT RIGHT WHEN I JUST THOUGHT

00:39:12.917 --> 00:39:16.253
OF ANOTHER ONE -- DEALING WITH
HELP AS A DO THEY HAVE THE

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:22.093
SAME STRUCTURE ON HOW THE --
SERVICE OR ASK YOU TO SERVICE

00:39:22.159 --> 00:39:26.897
THE CONSUMER GOING FORWARD
OR IS IT JUST A RUN THE GAMUT

00:39:26.964 --> 00:39:29.900
IT VERY MUCH DEPENDS ON THE
PAIR THERE'S DIFFERENT THERE'S

00:39:29.967 --> 00:39:33.003
DIFFERENT SO WE'RE SET UP FOR
THE THREE OFFICES IRAN WERE SET

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:36.407
UP FOR THREE TIER SO THERE'S
A MID LEVEL A DIRECT LEVEL

00:39:36.474 --> 00:39:40.811
AND A HIGH LEVEL OF SOME SOME
PAIRS ARE ONLY TO TEAR WHICH

00:39:40.878 --> 00:39:43.581
REQUIRES A LICENSE CLINICIAN
TO PROVIDE THE MIDLEVEL

00:39:43.647 --> 00:39:45.015
SUPERVISION WILL BE C.

00:39:45.082 --> 00:39:46.150
B.

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:48.119
A.'S AT THE LICENSE CLINICIAN
WAS ARE HARD TO COME BY AND

00:39:48.185 --> 00:39:51.122
A VERY EXPENSIVE SO FOR US
FOR THEM TO BE PROVIDING THE

00:39:51.188 --> 00:39:53.791
MIDLEVEL SUPERVISION IN A
SENSE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:58.729
WHICH IS WHY THAT LIMITS US
TO WEB HERE'S WE ACCEPT YEAH

00:39:58.796 --> 00:40:01.832
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR
ME HERE TODAY IT HAS BEEN

00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:05.336
UP WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR IS PEOPLE IN THE IN THE

00:40:05.402 --> 00:40:08.139
TRENCHES WORKING WITH THE
COMMUNITY GIVING US THEIR

00:40:08.205 --> 00:40:11.075
PERSPECTIVE AND THANK YOU SO
VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY

00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:13.144
THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY

WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO --
WHAT WE CALL THE SELF ADVOCATES

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:28.859
A WILL SANFORD -- HE'S WITH
THE FEATURES EXPORT OF WORK

00:40:28.926 --> 00:40:33.531
WITH WILL FOR MANY YEARS NOW
ON -- DIFFERENT ISSUES -- BOTH

00:40:33.597 --> 00:40:39.670
LEGISLATION AND -- HE IS ONE
OF MY GO TO GUYS FOR FOR THIS

00:40:39.737 --> 00:40:42.706
-- INFORMATION SO WILL THANK
YOU FOR BEING HERE PLACE TO BE

00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:45.609
HERE -- I'M GONNA TRY TO GET
AWAY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

00:40:45.676 --> 00:40:48.245
BUT THERE'S REALLY THREE MAJOR
ISSUES THAT ARE COMMITTEES TALK

00:40:48.312 --> 00:40:51.649
A LOT ABOUT YOU'VE HEARD -- THE
MENTION ALREADY ONE IS DIRECT

00:40:51.715 --> 00:40:54.852
PROFESSIONALS OUR ABILITY
TO HIRE AND RETAIN STAFF

00:40:54.919 --> 00:40:59.256
-- THERE'S A TOWN HALL LAST
WEEKEND'S -- WHERE THE AVERAGE

00:40:59.323 --> 00:41:03.227
ENTRY LEVEL JOB IN OAKLAND IS
SEVENTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR THE

00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:05.930
AVERAGE PAY FOR A RESTAURANT
WORKERS BETWEEN TWELVE AND

00:41:05.996 --> 00:41:09.967
FOURTEEN CAN YOU SEE WHY WE
DON'T HAVE RESPITE WORKERS OR

00:41:10.034 --> 00:41:14.338
OTHER FOLKS IT AS A HUGE IMPACT
OUR FOLKS THERE TO THE -- BOTH

00:41:14.405 --> 00:41:16.907
THE CALL AN HONOR TO TALK ABOUT
OUR HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION

00:41:16.974 --> 00:41:21.011
IS A BIG THREE UP THERE I
THINK IF I CAN JUMP FORWARD

00:41:21.078 --> 00:41:24.715
AND AND KIND OF ONE QUESTION
AT THE END I HATE TO SAY IT

00:41:24.782 --> 00:41:28.118
BUT PART OF THE BLAME LIVES IN
A PLACE CALLED SACRAMENTO BIG

00:41:28.185 --> 00:41:32.790
WHITE DOME WHERE EVERYTHING IS
FREE TO SILOS INTO THE CENTER

00:41:32.857 --> 00:41:35.392
RULES APPLIED EDUCATION THE
SENATE RULES THAT APPLY TO

00:41:35.459 --> 00:41:38.028
PART IN A RE AT IS A SET OF
RULES APPLY TO DDS IS SET A

00:41:38.095 --> 00:41:43.100
RULES APPLY TO AND COMMUNICATE
LICENSING THEY RARELY IF EVER

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:46.103
TALK AND ARE OFTEN IN DIRECT
CONFLICT SO THAT'S ONE OF

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:49.840
THE LARGEST BERRIES OF OUR
ABILITY TO ACTUALLY CREATE A

00:41:49.907 --> 00:41:52.877
SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS PEOPLE
VERY EFFECTIVELY SO WITH THAT

00:41:52.943 --> 00:41:56.180
I'M NEVER IT INVITE NICOLE
BICE BOTH LOG UP HERE I CAN

00:41:56.247 --> 00:42:02.219
ALMOST SO YOU THINK YOU USED
TO SAID THIS FROM ME OVER

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:06.423
ALSO WE GET THIS AND YET MAYBE

00:42:09.293 --> 00:42:11.795
WE GOTTA SO MAKE SURE

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:16.066
HE WON'T SAY HOW MUCH
THAT BOX COST YOU COULD

00:42:16.133 --> 00:42:18.636
BUY LIKE FOUR DOZEN I

00:42:21.906 --> 00:42:23.407
YEAH THAT WOULD

00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:25.042
TAKE

00:42:29.146 --> 00:42:31.982
SEC TECHNOLOGIST

00:42:34.952 --> 00:42:37.922
YEAH LIKE THAT TO THE GYM

00:42:49.233 --> 00:42:50.734
ON THE JOB

JUST WANT TO TAKE A SECOND
TO THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER

00:43:09.053 --> 00:43:13.157
PHRASE HERE FOR HAVING THIS
EVENT TONIGHT CHAIRING THE

00:43:13.223 --> 00:43:18.729
ID DO YOU SELECT COMMITTEE
AND IN GENERAL HAVING A BACKS

00:43:20.097 --> 00:43:25.302
WELL HERE I AM AGAIN TO TALK
ABOUT THE SAME DONE THING

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:30.240
THAT IS AFFECTING SO MANY
OF US LATELY TO ME THIS IS

00:43:30.307 --> 00:43:34.845
RIGHT UP THERE WITH THE NEED
FOR EQUIPMENT AND GOOD STAR

00:43:34.912 --> 00:43:39.850
BECAUSE WITHOUT TO IT'S NOT
THE WOULD MATTER FACT RIGHT I'M

00:43:39.917 --> 00:43:46.190
HERE TO TALK ABOUT HOUSING IN
PARTICULAR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:43:49.093 --> 00:43:53.097
I KNOW THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY
IS HAVING A HARD TIME FINDING

00:43:53.163 --> 00:43:58.168
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT WHEN
YOU ADD IN A DISABILITY AND THE

00:43:58.235 --> 00:44:03.707
NEED FOR ACCESSIBILITY IT IS
THE WORST THE ABSOLUTE WORST

00:44:09.013 --> 00:44:12.983
A FEW YEARS BACK I WAS GIVEN
A NOTICE THAT TIME I WOULD

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:16.520
HAVE TO MOVE OUT OF THE AND
PUT ONE TIME I HAD LIVED IN

00:44:16.587 --> 00:44:22.526
FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS NOT
BECAUSE I WAS A BATTER INTO I

00:44:22.593 --> 00:44:28.198
DIDN'T THROW ANY WILD PARTIES
I DIDN'T MAKE A LOT OF NOISE

00:44:28.265 --> 00:44:32.703
I DIDN'T EVEN BREAK AND THE
THINGS THAT WAS SINCE MINE

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:36.373
WHICH IS IMPRESSIVE SINCE I
LIVED THERE THROUGH THE BUDGET

TRAINER ADVOCATE AND MENTOR SHE
ACTUALLY -- LEAVE ADVOCATE ON A

00:56:13.803 --> 00:56:18.174
BILL THAT WAS PASSED -- TO PUT
CHANGING TABLES ADULT CHANGE

00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:22.512
TABLES AND PUBLIC FACILITIES
-- TO DO THAT SO EMPLOYMENT

00:56:22.579 --> 00:56:26.116
SOME THERE IS A DRIVER RIGHT
NOW IS IN THE SYSTEM AND WERE

00:56:26.182 --> 00:56:28.184
PRETTY WANTS YOU'LL HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY WHERE EMPLOYMENT

00:56:28.251 --> 00:56:32.155
FOR STATE -- WE HAVE A SEVEN
BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET WE SPEND

00:56:32.222 --> 00:56:35.892
ABOUT THIRTY MILLION ON OF
THAT SUPPORTING COMPETITIVE

00:56:35.959 --> 00:56:39.829
INTEGRATE IMPLEMENT SO WE
HAVEN'T PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR

00:56:39.896 --> 00:56:42.665
MOUTH IS RELATED TO THAT AND
SO THEY REALLY NEED TO FIGURE

00:56:42.732 --> 00:56:45.535
OUT A WAY TO IMPROVE AND AND
INCREASE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES

00:56:45.602 --> 00:56:49.372
FOR FOLKS IS GET OUR GUYS ARE
GREAT EMPLOYEES TO DO GREAT JOB

00:56:49.439 --> 00:56:52.008
THEY JUST WANT THE OPPORTUNITY
AND ARE CHALLENGES THAT WE

00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:55.111
NEED TO BUILD A TO HAVE FOLKS
TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM --

00:56:55.178 --> 00:56:59.015
WITH THE PANEL IT IN SACRAMENTO
MY EMPLOYMENT SPECIALISTS ARE

00:56:59.082 --> 00:57:01.384

00:57:05.855 --> 00:57:07.624

CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW THROUGH

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:09.726
THE DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONAL
GETTING PEOPLE TO BE ABLE WORK

00:57:09.793 --> 00:57:13.129
IN THE COMMUNITY SO I GUESS
WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS TO THE

00:57:13.196 --> 00:57:17.200
BEAN COUNTERS IN SACRAMENTO
IS THAT IF WE CREATE SUCCESSES

00:57:17.267 --> 00:57:21.171
IN THROUGH YOUR EMPLOYMENT WE
TAKE PEOPLE OFF OF ASSISTANCE

00:57:21.237 --> 00:57:23.807
REDUCE ASSISTANCE ALLOWS THEM
TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:57:23.873 --> 00:57:26.075
LIVE IN DIFFERENT HOUSING THAT
THEY DO CURRENTLY THE OTHER

00:57:26.142 --> 00:57:28.878
THING WITH HOUSING IS NOT ONLY
DO OUR FOLKS I'VE AFFORDABLE

00:57:28.945 --> 00:57:31.781
HOUSING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO
SUPPORT THEM INFORMAL HOUSING

00:57:31.848 --> 00:57:34.517
ALSO AND SO ONE OF THINGS ARE
REALLY ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO

00:57:34.584 --> 00:57:37.921
TRY TO DO IS LOOK AT AFFORDABLE
HOUSING ACROSS MULTIPLE THINGS

00:57:37.987 --> 00:57:40.690
DON'T BILL DISABILITY SPECIFIC
HOUSING BILLS AFFORDABLE

00:57:40.757 --> 00:57:43.259
HOUSING THE COMMUNITY CAN LIVE
IN AND OUR GUYS ARE JUST PART

00:57:43.326 --> 00:57:47.063
OF THAT MIX SO YEAH ABSOLUTELY
MORE WE CAN THE MOVE PEOPLE

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:49.666
FOR THE MORE THEY BECOME
CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY

00:57:49.732 --> 00:57:53.703

ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS AND BY

OUT THAT WE CANNOT GET FOOD
STAMPS AND OUR STATE WITH OUR

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:26.175

THE ADAPTIVE LEARNING CENTER
ONLY GET SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:44.660
A MONTH AND THAT'S ONE THING
THAT MAKES ME EXTREMELY MAD

01:02:44.727 --> 01:02:48.531
AND I THINK THE LAW SHOULD BE
CHANGED SECONDLY A LOT OF THE

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:55.238
COUNTIES HAVE A CLOSER SECTION
EIGHT LIST AND THEY CAN'T GET

01:02:55.304 --> 01:02:58.441

01:02:58.508 --> 01:03:02.111
SECTION EIGHT IN -- WITH THIS
COUNTING AND A LOT OF OTHER

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:07.617
COUNTIES ARE CLOSED AND WE
CANNOT AFFORD THE HEIGHT RENTS

01:03:07.683 --> 01:03:10.286
IN THE APARTMENT AND SECOND

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:17.226
SECONDLY I HAVE HIGH
FUNCTIONING AUTISM THE ONLY

01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:22.131
PROGRAM I'VE BEEN IN FOR TWENTY
ONE YEARS IS THE ONLY PROGRAM

01:03:22.198 --> 01:03:27.937
I EITHER HAVE THAT PROGRAM OR
A HAVE DISTRICT SO WE NEED MORE

01:03:28.004 --> 01:03:32.208
PROGRAMS WITH AUTISM FOR HIGH
RANKING PEOPLE WITH AUTISM AND

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:36.179
IT MAKES ME REALLY MAD WHEN I
FIND OUT PEOPLE OF LEFT TO OUR

01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:41.517
PROGRAM AND IF INDEED OUT ON
THE STREET BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:47.557
BAD CHOICES AND THERE'S NOTHING
ELSE IN IT MAKES ME REALLY MAD

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:52.895
AND STUFF AND SO I HAD TO SPEAK
MY LITTLE MAN ABOUT IT AND

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:57.300
THERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS ALSO
THE PROGRAM I'M IN IF I DIDN'T

01:03:57.366 --> 01:04:01.837
HAVE MY ART THERAPY AM A GARDEN
THIRTY I WOULD PROBABLY BE

01:04:01.904 --> 01:04:06.876
CLIMBING THE WALLS INSIDE THE
PROGRAM AND I NEED THAT TO KEEP

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:12.615
MYSELF AND ST BASICALLY AND SO
WE NEED MORE PROGRAMS BASICALLY

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:17.186
WITH WRAPAROUND SERVICES WITH
HOUSING AND ESPECIALLY FOR

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:22.225

WHAT WE NEED IT SPECIALLY N.

01:04:27.997 --> 01:04:33.069
AROUND THE STATE AND SO IF

INFLUXES WITH PEOPLE THAT NEED
AUTISM SERVICES BASICALLY I

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:10.906
WANTED THEY SUPPOSED TO DO
THERE'S NO SERVICES SO WE

01:05:10.973 --> 01:05:14.310

01:09:36.438 --> 01:09:39.375
SOLUTIONS BECAUSE I'VE HEARD
YOU SEVERAL TIMES ASKED FOR

01:09:39.441 --> 01:09:44.246
SOLUTIONS -- ACROSS CALIFORNIA
BUT PARTICULARLY IN THE BAY

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:47.950
AREA WHICH IS THE COMMUNITY
THAT I KNOW PASSED BETWEEN

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:51.220
SIXTY PERCENT AND SEVENTY
FIVE PERCENT OF ADULTS WITH

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:54.223
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES
ARE LIVING IN THE HOME OF

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:58.027

THEY'LL TELL YOU IS I HAVE AN
EXPIRATION DATE I'M WORRIED

I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN WHEN I'M NO LONGER ABLE

01:10:06.735 --> 01:10:10.272
TO BE THE HOUSING PROVIDER AND
THE PRIMARY SERVICE PROVIDER

01:10:10.339 --> 01:10:15.177
FOR MY ADULT SO HOUSING IS
A HUGE NEED IN OUR COMMUNITY

01:10:15.244 --> 01:10:20.015
AND -- THEY NEED IS GROWING
-- THE NUMBER OF ADULTS IN THE

01:10:20.082 --> 01:10:24.587
THIRTY TO FORTY YEAR OLD RANGE
IS ABOUT TO DOUBLE AND THAT

01:10:24.653 --> 01:10:28.290
INCREASE IS GOING TO CONTINUE
BECAUSE OF AN INCREASE IN THE

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:32.595
AUTISM DIAGNOSIS THAT BEGAN
ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AGO THE

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:36.165
OTHER FACTOR IS ARE ADULTS
ARE LIVING LONGER THANKS HER

01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:40.402
SERVICE SYSTEM -- SO WE NOW
SEE MOST PEOPLE LIVING INTO

01:10:40.469 --> 01:10:43.672
THEIR SIXTIES AND BEYOND
WHEN BEFORE THERE WOULD BE A

01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:48.110
SIGNIFICANT DROP OFF IN THE
EARLY FIFTIES ON THE HOUSING

01:10:48.177 --> 01:10:51.680
CRISIS IS SOMETHING THAT A
FAX CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES

01:10:51.747 --> 01:10:55.250
AND PEOPLE OF MANY DIFFERENT
INCOME LEVELS BUT IT TAKES

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:59.421
THE GREATEST TOLL ON THE MOST
VULNERABLE EXTREMELY LOW INCOME

01:10:59.488 --> 01:11:03.125
PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL
DISABILITIES -- WE WORK WITH

01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:05.761
SENATE RACE WE DON'T CENTER
TO HELP PEOPLE APPLY FOR

01:11:05.828 --> 01:11:10.032
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THERE'S A
HUGE SHORTAGE AND WHAT WE NEED

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:14.570
TO DO IS WE NEED TO CREATE
SPECIFIC HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES

01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:18.374
WITH STATE HOUSING FINANCE
SOURCES TARGETED TO PEOPLE

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:21.377
DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES
BECAUSE WE NEED TO CONNECT

01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:24.813
THE HOUSING OPPORTUNITY WITH
THIS WONDERFUL SUPPORT SYSTEM

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:28.851
THAT WE HAVE TO OUR REGIONAL
SENT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA

01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:32.888
ALL OF OUR STATE FINANCED
AFFORDABLE HOUSING REQUIRES

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:36.458
THAT AT LEAST TEN PERCENT
OF THE UNITS BE ACCESSIBLE

01:11:36.525 --> 01:11:41.296
TO PEOPLE WHO NEED PHYSICAL
ACCESSIBILITY I WOULD POINT OUT

01:11:41.363 --> 01:11:45.300
TO YOU THAT PEOPLE WITH MENTAL
AND COGNITIVE DISABILITIES

01:11:45.367 --> 01:11:49.304
HAVE THE SINGLE HIGHEST RATE
OF HOUSING DISCRIMINATION OF

01:11:49.371 --> 01:11:54.109
ANY OTHER DISABLED GROUP SO WE
HAVE THIS TARGET FOR CREATING

01:11:54.176 --> 01:11:57.179
ACCESSIBILITY FOR PEOPLE

DEAF BUT IT'S AMPLIFIED BECAUSE
THEY DON'T HAVE COMMUNICATION

-- WE'RE THE ONLY PROGRAM
IN THE BAY AREA THAT WILL

01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:55.684

OF AT LEAST A SAID SHE KIND
OF GAVE A LOT OF THE BULLET

01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:10.425
POINTS AS TO WHAT THE KIND OF
THE LOW HANGING FRUIT SOME OF

01:17:10.492 --> 01:17:12.995
THE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE
YOU KNOW THAT THE HALF DAY THE

01:17:13.061 --> 01:17:18.667
HOLIDAYS -- THE THE THE MEDIAN
RATES IF YOU COULD GIVE US A

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:20.936
LOT MORE MONEY BUT IF YOU DON'T
CHANGE THE MEANING RATES WE

01:17:21.003 --> 01:17:24.873
CAN'T SPEND IT -- SO REALLY
IS KIND OF A A BIG BIG PROBLEM

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:30.245
-- IN TRYING TO GET MORE MONEY

MAKING IT A PRIORITY BECAUSE
THERE'S BEEN NO NET INCREASE IN

01:17:35.884 --> 01:17:38.787
SIXTEEN YEARS -- I KNOW WE HAD
AN INCREASE A COUPLE YEARS AGO

01:17:38.854 --> 01:17:41.590
THOUSAND BACK FILL FROM CUTS
THAT WE HAD DURING MY TIME IN

01:17:41.656 --> 01:17:45.460
THE LEGISLATURE -- SO -- ALL
THE OTHER COMPONENTS IN THE

01:17:45.527 --> 01:17:48.864
STATE BUDGET YOUR EDUCATION
A LAW ENFORCEMENT EXCEPT ARE

01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:51.266
THEY IF THEY DON'T HAVE AN
INCREASE EVERY YEAR IT'S IT'S

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:55.303
A CRISIS -- WE GO SIXTEEN
YEARS -- WITHOUT A NET INCREASE

01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:59.274
IT'S A IT'S A CATASTROPHE
-- TRANSPORTATION ECHO THAT

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:03.678
-- MY -- MY COMPANY IS A
MISSION HOPE DAY PROGRAM WE

01:18:03.745 --> 01:18:06.948
SIR FOREIGN FIFTY A BEHAVIORAL
CLIENTS -- EVERY DAY WE HAVE

01:18:07.015 --> 01:18:10.585
A TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM --
IS SEVERELY UNDERFUNDED BUT

01:18:10.652 --> 01:18:13.088
TRANSPORTATION FOR EVERYBODY
IN THIS ROOM IS ABSOLUTELY

01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:16.291
ESSENTIAL -- YOU KNOW AND YOU
IN THE IN A GREAT POSITION TO

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:19.795
BE ABLE TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON
THAT -- IF YOU ALL THE IDEAS

01:18:19.861 --> 01:18:23.498
FOR SELF DETERMINATION --
PERSON CENTERED OF PLANNING

01:18:23.565 --> 01:18:26.835
AND AND PROGRAMS IF YOU CAN'T
GET THERE THEN IT'S NOT GOING

01:18:26.902 --> 01:18:30.138
TO HAPPEN SO IT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT -- YOU ASK A OF

01:18:30.205 --> 01:18:32.874
CUSTOM INSIDE BASEBALL STUFF
IS TO WILL HOW CAN MAKE THINGS

01:18:32.941 --> 01:18:35.977
BETTER ONE THING IS THAT WE
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS KIND

01:18:36.044 --> 01:18:40.248
OF THE RATES WITHIN THE RATES
SO IF YOU -- IF YOU FIND --

01:18:40.315 --> 01:18:44.186
-- THE DOLLARS TO GIVE TO THE
COMMUNITY IF YOU JUST DO THE

01:18:44.252 --> 01:18:46.455
STANDARD THING OF WELL WE'RE
GOING TO GIVE EVERYBODY A FIVE

01:18:46.521 --> 01:18:50.992
PERCENT INCREASE ACROSS THE
BOARD -- THAT ISN'T REALLY

01:18:51.059 --> 01:18:53.795
TAKE SOME OF THE STRUCTURAL
ISSUES OUT OF IT FOR INSTANCE

01:18:53.862 --> 01:18:57.833
AT MISSION HOPE IN OUR WE HAVE
SIX DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND

01:18:57.899 --> 01:19:01.670
OUR RATES FOR TRANSPORTATION
FOURTEEN DOLLARS AND FORTY SIX

01:19:01.736 --> 01:19:05.040
FOURTEEN DOLLARS AND FORTY SIX
NINETEEN THIRTY TWELVE DOLLARS

01:19:05.107 --> 01:19:07.709
AND THIRTY EIGHT CENTS TWELVE
HOURS AND THIRTY EIGHT CENTS

01:19:07.776 --> 01:19:11.146
AND SO IF YOU GIVE EVERYBODY
AN INCREASE THEN A FIVE PERCENT

01:19:11.213 --> 01:19:14.616
INCREASE THAN THOSE ONES THAT
ARE STOCK -- JUST HAPPENSTANCE

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:17.319
THAT THEY STARTED THE PROGRAM
AND THEY GOT CAUGHT IN THIS IN

01:19:17.385 --> 01:19:21.189
THIS RATE STRUCTURE -- THEY'RE
STILL WAY UNDER FUNDED AND

01:19:21.256 --> 01:19:24.726
SO KIND OF A OF A RESET AND
HOW YOU CAN LOOK AT WHAT'S A

01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:27.896
REALISTIC FUNDING LEVEL FOR
FOR ALL THESE PROGRAMS INSTEAD

01:19:27.963 --> 01:19:30.198
OF JUST KIND OF RATIONING UP
WHAT HISTORICALLY HAS BUILT

01:19:30.265 --> 01:19:33.335
UP WOULD BE -- SOMETHING TO
REALLY LOOK AT IT'S A LOT

01:19:33.401 --> 01:19:37.239
HARDER WORK BUT IT MAKES MORE
SENSE -- AND THEN FINALLY --

01:19:37.305 --> 01:19:41.109

-- REALLY -- YOU INTERRUPTED
MY SAYING THANK YOU FOR BEING

01:31:02.890 --> 01:31:07.128
HERE AND MAKE IN THE TIME OF
A TO -- IS SPECIALLY COMING

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:09.797
UP -- YOU KNOW FROM ACROSS
THE VALLEY IN FROM SAN JOSE IN

01:31:09.864 --> 01:31:13.434
OTHER PLACES SO THANK YOU FOR
DOING THAT IT'S I'VE BEEN A LOT

01:31:13.501 --> 01:31:15.403
OF SELECT COMMITTEE HEARINGS
MY THIRTY YEAR CAREER AS A

01:31:15.469 --> 01:31:18.406
LOBBYIST AND THEY ARE ALWAYS
AS WELL ATTENDED SO THANK YOU

01:31:18.472 --> 01:31:22.777
FOR DOING THAT I'M GONNA TRY
TO MAKE THREE QUICK POINTS --

01:31:22.844 --> 01:31:25.580
ON BEHALF OF THE ORGANIZATION
I WORK WITH CALLED THE ALLIANCE

01:31:25.646 --> 01:31:29.750
IT'S -- NETWORK A SMALL NETWORK
OF PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE

01:31:29.817 --> 01:31:32.720
BUT SOME OF THIS REFLECT MY
VIEWS ON HAVING WORKED IN THIS

01:31:32.787 --> 01:31:36.724
ISSUE OR FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AS
A LOBBYIST -- ONE THING YOU

01:31:36.791 --> 01:31:39.727
HAVE THE -- AND I'LL TRY NOT
TO DO PLAY GROUND THAT'S BEEN

01:31:39.794 --> 01:31:42.797
COVERED ONE THING THOSE TALKED
ABOUT EARLIER IS A RATE STUDY

01:31:42.864 --> 01:31:46.167
THIS COMING DO WE ARE STUDYING
-- IN THEORY WHAT IT COSTS TO

01:31:46.234 --> 01:31:49.437
PROVIDE THESE SERVICES IN THE
SYSTEM THAT STUDY IS SUPPOSED

01:31:49.503 --> 01:31:53.274
TO COME OUT SOMETIME IN MARCH
EXPERIENCE TELLS ME THAT THAT

01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:57.345
STUDY MAY OR MAY NOT SHOW UP
ON TIME -- LET'S SAY IT DOESN'T

01:31:57.411 --> 01:32:00.715
WORK IT SHOWS UP ON TIME THE
GAP BETWEEN THE TIME WHEN YOU

01:32:00.781 --> 01:32:04.285
WOULD HAVE THE TIME TO REACT
AS A LEGISLATURE BETWEEN MARCH

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:07.421
AND MAY REVISED PUT SOMETHING
IN THE BUDGET THAT REFLECTS

01:32:07.488 --> 01:32:11.092
INDIAN THAT REPORT IS HIGHLY
UNLIKELY SO ONE THING I THINK

01:32:11.158 --> 01:32:14.528
YOU SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER
MOVING TO TRY TO DO IS TO PUT

01:32:14.595 --> 01:32:17.565
IN PLACE SOME KIND OF BRIDGE
FUNDING REGARDLESS OF WHAT

01:32:17.632 --> 01:32:21.502
THE STUDY SAYS TO HELP THIS
COMMUNITY CONTINUE ON TO SOME

01:32:21.569 --> 01:32:24.672
KIND OF FUTURE CONTEMPLATE
PUTTING SOME KIND OF FUNDING

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:27.541
IN IS A PLACEHOLDER FOR WHAT
WE'RE GONNA SEE THIS RATE

01:32:27.608 --> 01:32:30.611
STUDY SECOND ISSUE THE WAITING
LIST THAT IS BEEN MENTIONED A

01:32:30.678 --> 01:32:33.948
COUPLE TIMES WAITING LISTS ARE
TRICKY BECAUSE ONE PROGRAMS

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:35.950
OFTEN ARE GOING TO TELL YOU
THAT THEY HAVE A WAITING LIST

01:32:36.017 --> 01:32:39.487
THAT DISCREDITS THEIR PROGRAM
THE SECOND THING IN THAT AREA

01:32:39.553 --> 01:32:42.990
IS THAT AWAITING THIS CAN BE
ONE OF TWO THINGS ALSO IT CAN

01:32:43.057 --> 01:32:47.161
BE A PERSON WHO YOU'RE WAITING
TO GIVE A SERVICE TO YOU DON'T

01:32:47.228 --> 01:32:50.298
HAVE THE STAFF TO DO IT OR YOU
STICK HIM IN ANOTHER SERVICE

01:32:50.364 --> 01:32:53.467
THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE UNTIL
THE RIGHT SERVICES AVAILABLE

01:32:53.534 --> 01:32:56.971
FORM THAT'S ANOTHER FORM OF
HOW WAITING OCCURS LAST THING

01:32:57.038 --> 01:33:00.775
ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER
-- PIECE IN THE FUNDING YOU

01:33:00.841 --> 01:33:04.045
KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER TIME
IS THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT HAD

01:33:04.111 --> 01:33:07.148
THE COURAGE TO STAND UP TO THE
ADMINISTRATION AND IS LET THE

01:33:07.214 --> 01:33:10.318
ADMINISTRATION RUN THE SHOW
ON THIS ISSUE I'VE WATCHED

01:33:10.384 --> 01:33:14.388
STOCKTON DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER
AGNEW'S DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER

01:33:14.455 --> 01:33:18.159
CAMERI -- STATE HOSPITAL WHICH
HAD OUR CLIENTS IN IT AS WELL

01:33:18.225 --> 01:33:21.162
LETTERMAN DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER
EVERYONE OF THEM CLOSE NONE

01:33:21.228 --> 01:33:23.531
OF THE ASSETS ARE OPERATING
DOLLARS WOULD TRANSFER TO THE

01:33:23.597 --> 01:33:26.901
SYSTEM WE GET NO BENEFIT WHEN
THESE CLOTHES CENTER PEOPLE PUT

01:33:26.968 --> 01:33:30.371
BACK IN THE COMMUNITY WHAT'S
HAPPENING TODAY IS YOU HAVE

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:34.608
TO FINAL DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS
AND CLOSER HUGE ASSETS CINEMA

01:33:34.675 --> 01:33:38.079
WOULD LIKE THAT PROPERTY STATE
CINEMAS WITH NOTHING ON IT IF

01:33:38.145 --> 01:33:41.649
POSSIBLE MAKE THEM PAY FOR IT
LET'S GET SOMETHING OUT OF THAT

01:33:41.716 --> 01:33:44.652
FAIRVIEW DOWN ORANGE COUNTY'S
ARE INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE

01:33:44.719 --> 01:33:48.222
PIECE OF PROPERTY THE SYSTEM
SHOULD BENEFIT FROM THAT IN

01:33:48.289 --> 01:33:51.993
WE SHOULD ALSO BENEFIT BY
KEEPING THE OPERATIONS DOLLAR

01:33:52.059 --> 01:33:54.695

GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS VERY
BEEN DONE I'M WITH BILLION

01:34:26.293 --> 01:34:30.064
CORNERS WORRIED NONPROFIT
HOUSING -- DEVELOPER AND WE

01:34:30.131 --> 01:34:35.369
PROVIDE HOUSING SERVICES --
BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO -- I

01:34:35.436 --> 01:34:39.206
HAVE -- WELL I PROBABLY WILL
USE MY THREE MINUTES BECAUSE

01:34:39.273 --> 01:34:42.810
AUDRAN NICOLE IN JAN ALL GAVE
VERY GOOD DESCRIPTIONS OF

01:34:42.877 --> 01:34:47.848
WHAT THE HOUSING SITUATION IS
IN THE ID THE FIELD -- I'VE

01:34:47.915 --> 01:34:51.452
WORKED IN THIS FIELD ABOUT
FORTY THREE YEARS NOW AND WHAT

01:34:51.519 --> 01:34:55.956
I'VE SEEN IS OVER THOSE YEARS
A NUMBER OF PARADIGM SHIFTS

01:34:56.023 --> 01:34:58.993
AND I THINK RIGHT NOW WE'RE
IN A PARADIGM SHIFT RELATED

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:02.496
TO HOUSING I THINK WELL WHAT
I SEE THE ONE OF THE THINGS

01:35:02.563 --> 01:35:07.134
THAT'S HAPPENED IS DUE TO
THE SUCCESS OF OTHER AREAS

01:35:07.201 --> 01:35:11.605
OF A PERSON'S LIFE WEATHERBY
RECREATION OR EMPLOYMENT THAT

01:35:11.672 --> 01:35:14.208
THERE'S BEEN A MOVEMENT TOWARD
INTEGRATION AND FULL IN THE

01:35:14.275 --> 01:35:17.378
INCLUSION AND THAT'S A GREAT
THING FOR ALL THE FOLKS WITH

01:35:17.445 --> 01:35:21.449
ID DE THAT'S NOW HAPPENING
WITH HOUSING AND I THINK THAT'S

01:35:21.515 --> 01:35:25.986
A WONDERFUL THING -- WE HAVE
LOTS OF PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW

01:35:26.053 --> 01:35:28.622
THE NUMBERS BUT PROBABLY MORE
THAN HALF OF THE PEOPLE THAT

01:35:28.689 --> 01:35:32.259
ARE BECOMING ADULTS TO DO NOT
WANT TO LIVE IN GROUP HOMES

01:35:32.326 --> 01:35:35.596
THEY DO NOT WANT LIVING LICENSE
GROUP HOMES AND WHAT THEY'RE

01:35:35.663 --> 01:35:39.433
WANTING OUR PLACES OF THEIR
OWN AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:42.169
NOT ENOUGH WE KNOW THERE'S NOT
ENOUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR

01:35:42.236 --> 01:35:45.739
EVERYBODY LET ALONE THE PEOPLE
WITH THE ID DE WHO TENDED

01:35:45.806 --> 01:35:48.676
NOT BE THE PEOPLE WHO GET ON
WAITING LISTS AND THAT KIND OF

01:35:48.742 --> 01:35:52.780
THING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING
-- JAN MENTIONED I THINK A

01:35:52.847 --> 01:35:56.050
COUPLE GOOD SUGGESTIONS IN
TERMS OF WHAT WE COULD BE DOING

01:35:56.117 --> 01:35:59.520
-- ANOTHER ONE I WOULD I THINK
WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT IS

01:35:59.587 --> 01:36:02.857
THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THE RENTAL
SUBSIDIES MOST OF THE PEOPLE

01:36:02.923 --> 01:36:05.693
THE ADULTS WERE SERVING ARE
GOING TO CONTINUE TO NEED SOME

01:36:05.759 --> 01:36:09.930
KIND OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE --
WE KNOW THE HEAD SECTION EIGHT

01:36:09.997 --> 01:36:12.867
IS NOT GOING TO BE THE ANSWER
AND SAID -- SAN FRANCISCO

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:16.070
WE MAY PEOPLE PROBABLY READ
THAT HOUSING AUTHORITIES IN

01:36:16.137 --> 01:36:18.973
DEBT TO BUY THIRTY MILLION
DOLLARS SO THERE'S NOT GONNA

01:36:19.039 --> 01:36:21.876
BE SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS THERE
FOR PROBABLY THE REST OF MY

01:36:21.942 --> 01:36:25.579
LIFE TIME BUT WE NEED TO LOOK
AT POSSIBILITIES OF HOW WE

01:36:25.646 --> 01:36:30.651
CAN CREATE CREATIVELY -- RENT
SUBSIDIES FOR PEOPLE'S ID D.

01:36:30.851 --> 01:36:31.785

THIRTEEN OR MORE AGENCIES AT
THIS POINT HAVE POOLED THEIR

01:36:50.704 --> 01:36:55.376

LIKE EXACTLY LIKE THE FLEXIBLE
HOUSING SUBSIDY POOL BUT WE

01:37:12.092 --> 01:37:14.495

OVERALL COST OF LIVING IS A
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE POINT

01:42:24.838 --> 01:42:28.942
NINE NEARLY DOUBLE THE NATIONAL
AVERAGE EXPENSIVE TO LIVE IN

01:42:29.009 --> 01:42:32.012
CONTRA COSTA COUNTY THE COST

01:42:32.079 --> 01:42:36.750
FASTEST RATE IN TEN YEARS GAS
PRICES ALONE HAVE SURGED NEARLY

01:42:36.817 --> 01:42:40.587
TWENTY FIVE POINT FOUR PERCENT
THIS PAST YEAR AND HOUSING

01:42:40.654 --> 01:42:43.857
IS THE BIGGEST FACTOR IN THE
COST OF LIVING DIFFERENCE

01:42:43.924 --> 01:42:46.593
MANY EMPLOYEES WORKING IN
HUMAN SERVICES ARE LOW WAGE

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:50.230

01:42:50.297 --> 01:42:53.967

DEMANDING HUMAN SERVICE WORKERS

01:42:59.773 --> 01:43:03.110
NEED A BROAD RANGE OF SKILLS
INTERPERSONAL SKILLS PROBLEM

01:43:03.176 --> 01:43:07.681
SOLVING COMMUNICATION SKILLS
PATIENTS THE LIST GOES ON HUMAN

01:43:07.748 --> 01:43:10.551

HERE MOTO I LIVE IN BRENTWOOD

01:44:13.413 --> 01:44:16.049
AND I'M A SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST
WITH THE PLAN WITH THE SCHOOL

01:44:16.116 --> 01:44:19.453
DISTRICT I WORK RIGHT ACROSS
THE STREET FROM MY LIVE RIGHT

01:44:19.519 --> 01:44:25.158
ACROSS STREET FROM WHERE I WORK
-- -- MY BACKGROUND IS A SCHOOL

01:44:25.225 --> 01:44:28.829
PSYCHOLOGIST BEEN DOING THAT
FOR ALMOST TWENTY PLUS YEARS

01:44:28.895 --> 01:44:31.064
I'VE ALSO BEEN -- WORK FOR
THE DIAGNOSTIC CENTER NORTHERN

01:44:31.131 --> 01:44:35.836
CALIFORNIA FREMONT PART OF THIS
-- CALIFORNIA PART OF EDUCATION

01:44:35.902 --> 01:44:39.306
SEVEN YEARS THEN PROFESSOR AND
A PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR SEVEN

01:44:39.373 --> 01:44:42.542
PLUS YEARS AND BEEN ELECTED
SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER TWICE

01:44:42.609 --> 01:44:46.813
-- DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES
SOMETHING KNOWN VERY WELL --

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:51.451
GIVEN THAT -- I'M HERE TO TALK
ABOUT GETTING FUNDING FOR THE

01:44:51.518 --> 01:44:56.623
REGIONAL CENTERS EARLY EARLY
IDENTIFICATION EARLY EARLY

01:44:56.690 --> 01:45:00.927
INTERVENTION IS THE KEY BIRTH
TO THREE IF WE DON'T GET THEM

01:45:00.994 --> 01:45:04.431
OR IF THEY DON'T GET SERVICES
EARLY IT TAKES THAT MUCH LONGER

01:45:04.498 --> 01:45:07.634
FOR THE BENEFITS TO OCCUR
THAT'S WHERE IT SO THERE'S A

01:45:07.701 --> 01:45:10.971
DOMINO EFFECT IF THEY DON'T GET
THE FUNDING IT'LL IMPACT THE

01:45:11.038 --> 01:45:14.641
SCHOOLS AND THEN THE SCHOOLS
HAVE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES

01:45:14.708 --> 01:45:18.612
LONGER AND MORE IMPACTED SO
MY COLLEAGUES IN THE REGIONAL

01:45:18.679 --> 01:45:21.715
CENTERS DESPERATELY NEED THIS
AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE

01:45:21.782 --> 01:45:27.054
HUGE GIGANTIC CASELOADS THAT
THAT'S IN A LOT OF TURNOVER

01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:28.989
THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
IDENTIFY THE KIDS TURNING

01:45:29.056 --> 01:45:32.426
THREE YET SOMETIMES AND GET
US THAT INFORMATION RIGHT AWAY

01:45:32.492 --> 01:45:36.196
WHERE WE ARE REQUIRED BY LAW
TO DO THE ASSESSMENTS AND THEN

01:45:36.263 --> 01:45:40.434
LEGAL THINGS START HAPPENING
WITH SCHOOLS -- IT WAS BY THAT

01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:44.971
THAT -- BY ABA SERVICES AND
IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS SCHOOL

01:45:45.038 --> 01:45:47.040
DISTRICTS ARE MANDATED ONCE
YOU HAVE AN ID P.

01:45:47.107 --> 01:45:50.844
TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE THAT'S
THAT'S IT SCHOOL DISCRIMINATED

01:45:50.911 --> 01:45:55.849
BRED PROVIDE SERVICES -- IF
THE NEED IS THERE AND SOME

01:45:55.916 --> 01:46:00.887
DISTRICTS BECAUSE OF LEGAL
ISSUES ARE ARE ARE LOCAL TO TWO

01:46:00.954 --> 01:46:04.825
TO FORM THAT OUT THEY TRY TO DO
IT IN HOUSE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

01:46:04.891 --> 01:46:10.664
-- WE WE HAVE THE CBA'S WE HAVE
BEHAVIOR TAX IN BE INVENTED

01:46:10.731 --> 01:46:15.736
-- MY CONCERN WITH THE CURRENT
FUNDING FORMULA FOR EDUCATION

01:46:16.103 --> 01:46:19.439
HERTZ GROWING DISTRICTS LIKE
BRENT WOULD BRENTWOOD HAS ONE

01:46:19.506 --> 01:46:23.777
OF THE LOWEST EIGHTY EIGHT
BASE RATES IN THE STATE IF

01:46:23.844 --> 01:46:29.082
YOU LOOK IT UP YET OUR HOUSING
COSTS ARE ASTRONOMICAL SO ONE

01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:33.253
WOULD THINK THAT HOUSING COSTS
SCHOOLS GET FUNDING NOW IT'S

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:37.991
NOT THAT IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE
-- AND THIS IS LIKE LAMMERS

01:46:38.058 --> 01:46:43.396
VILLE AND MOUNT HOUSE FALLING
TO THE SAME RAPID GROWTH IN AN

01:46:43.463 --> 01:46:46.900
AGRARIAN AREA FUNDING SOURCES
ARE REALLY MINIMAL FOR THE

01:46:46.967 --> 01:46:49.336
SCHOOLS IT CAN BE AS MUCH
AS TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED

01:46:49.402 --> 01:46:52.405
DOLLARS PER STUDENT DIFFERENCE
SOME EVEN FAR GREATER THAN

01:46:52.472 --> 01:46:56.409
THAT SO THAT'S SOMETHING
I'M HOPING THAT WILL HAPPEN

01:46:56.476 --> 01:46:59.112
WITH THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION
THANK YOU VERY MUCH LOOK

01:46:59.179 --> 01:47:01.681

HI GOOD EVENING MY NAME

01:49:23.790 --> 01:49:26.760
DISTINCT HONOR AND THE DISTINCT
CHALLENGE TO BE THE EXECUTIVE

01:49:26.826 --> 01:49:30.864
DIRECTOR OF GOLDEN GATE
REGIONAL CENTER WE SERVE ABOUT

01:49:30.931 --> 01:49:34.200
ONE LAUGH WE SERVE ABOUT NINETY
SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE AND SAN

01:49:34.267 --> 01:49:37.537
MATTEO SAN FRANCISCO IN MARIN
COUNTIES -- EARLIER SPEAKER

01:49:37.604 --> 01:49:40.774
TALKED ABOUT THE PERCENTAGE
ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF

01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:43.743
COST OF LIVING -- WE'RE BETWEEN
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AND TWO

01:49:43.810 --> 01:49:46.513
HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT
MARIN COUNTY IS NOW MY AN

01:49:46.579 --> 01:49:50.617
EXPENSIVE COUNTY WHICH I TAKE
NOTE AND IN GLEE OF OF TELLING

01:49:50.684 --> 01:49:53.486
THEM -- SO I WORK IN THE FIELD
FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS MOSTLY

01:49:53.553 --> 01:49:56.423
WITH PROVIDER STARTED IN DIRECT
SERVICE IN A SHELTERED WORKSHOP

01:49:56.489 --> 01:50:00.226
AND WORKED IN SUPPORT OF LIVING
IN RESIDENTIAL AND -- RESPITE

01:50:00.293 --> 01:50:04.331
AN AFTER SCHOOL RECREATION --
AND I'VE BEEN WITH THE GOLDEN

01:50:04.397 --> 01:50:07.434
GATE REGIONAL CENTER NOW FOR
ON ON COMING ON THREE YEARS

01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:10.036
AND I LOVE TO TALK ABOUT SOCIAL
JUSTICE AND CIVIL RIGHTS THAT'S

01:50:10.103 --> 01:50:13.039
ONE FROM TRUMAN IN THE FIELD
BUT I'M REALLY GOING TO TALK

01:50:13.106 --> 01:50:15.809
ABOUT THE TWO STRUCTURAL THINGS
THAT I THINK ARE GOING TO MAKE

01:50:15.875 --> 01:50:19.446
THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IN THE
NEXT DECADES WHICH IS -- MEDIAN

01:50:19.512 --> 01:50:23.116
RATES AND -- THE FUNDING OF
REGIONAL CENTERS AND TO TRY

01:50:23.183 --> 01:50:27.220
TO ADD SOMETHING HOPEFULLY NEW
TO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT --

01:50:27.287 --> 01:50:30.623
MEDIAN RATES IT'S NOT A NEW
IDEA FOR CALIFORNIA -- WHEN I

01:50:30.690 --> 01:50:34.761
WAS -- STARTED OUT AND THROUGH
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN DIFFERENT

01:50:34.828 --> 01:50:37.797
WAYS THERE WAS A CONNECTION
BETWEEN THE COST OF PROVIDING

01:50:37.864 --> 01:50:41.267
SUPPORT IN THE RATES THAT WERE
PAID FOR SUPPORT WILL AND I

01:50:41.334 --> 01:50:44.104
AM PROBABLY ONE OR TWO OTHER
PEOPLE REMEMBER COST STATEMENTS

01:50:44.170 --> 01:50:47.807
WERE YOU IN FOR PROVIDERS ARE
YOU RECORDED HOW MUCH IT COSTS

01:50:47.874 --> 01:50:51.077
THAT WERE ALLOWABLE COSTS HE
DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

01:50:51.144 --> 01:50:54.347
YOU SERVED IT WASN'T A PERFECT
SYSTEM BUT YOU IT WAS CONNECTED

01:50:54.414 --> 01:50:58.852
TO WHAT IT COSTS TO PROVIDE
SERVICES -- AND SO THAT ENDED

01:50:58.918 --> 01:51:01.554
IN NINETY SIX NINETY SEVEN FOR
THE BIG SERVICES AND THEN IN

01:51:01.621 --> 01:51:04.657
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE REGIONAL
CENTERS LOS THE FLEXIBILITY

01:51:04.724 --> 01:51:08.061
TO GO NEGOTIATE RATES AND
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN COSTS

01:51:08.128 --> 01:51:11.931
AND RATES FELL AWAY SOMEWHERE
TALKING ABOUT RATE INCREASES

01:51:11.998 --> 01:51:14.667
IT'S NOT AND IT RATE INCREASES
JUST HAVING SOME RATIONAL

01:51:14.734 --> 01:51:18.038
CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT THE
COSTS ARE AND WHAT THE SERVICES

01:51:18.104 --> 01:51:21.374
ARE -- REALLY QUICKLY WITH
THE LAST THING ON MEDIAN RATES

01:51:21.441 --> 01:51:24.210
AS I HAD A PROVIDER FROM THIS
AREA WHO HAS ONE OF THE MOST

01:51:24.277 --> 01:51:28.548
ROBUST -- PROGRAMS AND SERVICES
AND RATES IN OUR AREA AND SHE

01:51:28.615 --> 01:51:31.651
WENT TO US DESPERATE FOR STAFF
YOU INTO A JOB FAIR IN TROUBLE

01:51:31.718 --> 01:51:35.388
TODAY WAS PLAYING HIGHER THAN
SHE COULD OFFER -- AS HER

01:51:35.455 --> 01:51:39.159
ENTRY LEVEL AND THAT SERVING
FOLKS WITH SIGNIFICANT NEEDS

01:51:39.225 --> 01:51:42.429
AGAIN THAT THROUGH RATES THAT
ARE ON THE HIGHER END OF OUR

01:51:42.495 --> 01:51:47.600
RATES REGION CENTER FUNDING
IS BASICALLY SAID SAID ON --

01:51:47.667 --> 01:51:50.303
MECHANISM FROM THE MID EIGHTIES
THAT HAS AGAIN NO CONNECTION

01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:52.772
WITH COSTS AND WE DEARLY LOVE
OUR COLLEAGUE HEATHER FROM

01:51:52.839 --> 01:51:56.476
THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT WE GET
THE SAME AMOUNT FOR THE CASE

01:51:56.543 --> 01:51:59.279
MANAGERS AND I'VE GOLDEN GATE
WE'VE GOT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

01:51:59.345 --> 01:52:01.948
TWENTY FIVE STAFF AND A HUNDRED
AND SIXTY OR SEVENTY CASE

01:52:02.015 --> 01:52:05.218
MANAGERS CAN MAKE TWENTY TO
THIRTY PERCENT MORE WORKING

01:52:05.285 --> 01:52:08.254
FOR GOVERNMENT WORKING FOR
THE COUNTIES AS SOCIAL WORKERS

01:52:08.321 --> 01:52:10.990
THEY STAY WITH US BECAUSE
THEY LOVE THE FAMILIES AND THE

01:52:11.057 --> 01:52:14.627
INDIVIDUALS THEY SERVE AND ARE
CONNECTED TO THEM AND BUT WE

01:52:14.694 --> 01:52:17.030
CAN DRIVE THEM AWAY IF THEY
COULD JUST CANCER FIVE IN OUR

01:52:17.097 --> 01:52:22.202
AREA -- SO I'D LOVE TO TALK TO
MORE ABOUT THOSE THINGS -- BUT

01:52:22.268 --> 01:52:25.505
I MEANT ZERO SO I'M GOING TO
SAY THAT THE LANHAM ACT AS ITS

01:52:25.572 --> 01:52:29.609
VERY CORE IS ABOUT EQUAL ACCESS
NOT PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT

01:52:29.676 --> 01:52:33.046
EQUAL ACCESS TO LIVE WORK AND
PLAY AND AS PEOPLE WITHOUT

01:52:33.113 --> 01:52:36.716
TO ABILITIES TO AND THE FIRST
LINE IS THAT THE CALIFORNIA

01:52:36.783 --> 01:52:40.186
ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR
THEIR CITIZENS IN THERE AND

01:52:40.253 --> 01:52:42.522
-- COMMUNITY MEMBERS WITH
DEVELOPMENTAL AND INTELLECTUAL

01:52:42.589 --> 01:52:47.160
DISABILITIES AND AT SOME POINT
WITH THE SEVERE UNDERFUNDING

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:49.729
CALIFORNIA'S NO LONGER
ACCEPTING THAT RESPONSIBILITY

01:52:49.796 --> 01:52:52.565
AND I IT'S GONNA TAKE EVERYONE
IN THIS ROOM TO ADVOCATE

01:52:52.632 --> 01:52:58.138

GETTING REGIONAL TO ACCEPT HIM
I HAVE CALLED SEVERAL TIMES

HEAR THAT THEY PROVIDE TONS OF
SERVICES WE HAVE YET TO SEE A

MAJORITY OF THOSE SERVICES ANY
HERE THAT THEY'RE REQUESTING

01:54:59.259 --> 01:55:02.795
FUNDING BUT I'M NOT SURE WHERE
THOSE FUNDS ARE GOING BECAUSE

01:55:02.862 --> 01:55:05.498
I DON'T FEEL THAT THEY'RE GOING
TO WRECK THE TO THE FAMILIES

01:55:05.565 --> 01:55:08.568
AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE

01:55:09.202 --> 01:55:12.138
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR WHERE THOSE
FUNDS ARE GOING TO SEE THAT

01:55:12.205 --> 01:55:14.974
THEY ARE GOING TO THE FEES
ARE THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS

01:55:15.041 --> 01:55:19.045

IT IS BUT I WANT TO SEE THE

01:55:19.112 --> 01:55:22.248
TRICKLE DOWN TO THE FAMILIES
HUNTER WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW

01:55:22.315 --> 01:55:27.353

I'D DAY EIGHT DOLLARS FOR DOWN
ITS YOU HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD OF

02:05:45.838 --> 02:05:49.875
THE COMPANY CALLED LIKE SIMPLE
UCLA SCHOOL OF LAW YOU MAY HAVE

02:05:49.942 --> 02:05:53.812
HEARD OF THEM THEY RELEASED A
PEER REVIEWED JOURNAL ARTICLE

02:05:53.879 --> 02:05:57.850
IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN
THAT FAIRLY RECENT THEY

02:05:57.917 --> 02:06:01.220
FOUND OUT THAT NINETY FIVE
PERCENT OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:06:01.287 --> 02:06:05.391
AGENCIES IN THIS STATE USE A
PRIVATE COMPANY THAT SECRET

02:06:05.457 --> 02:06:09.161
NO PUBLIC INPUT TO WRITE THE
PUBLIC POLICIES FOR POLICE

02:06:09.228 --> 02:06:13.299
DEPARTMENTS THEIR SOLE FOCUS
IS REDUCING LIABILITY NOTHING

02:06:13.365 --> 02:06:16.635
ABOUT PROVIDING GOOD SERVICE TO
THE PEOPLE THEY RECOMMEND THAT

02:06:16.702 --> 02:06:19.872
OFFICE AT THAT AGENCIES TAKE
PROTECT AND SERVE OFF THEIR

02:06:19.939 --> 02:06:22.841
PATROL CARS BECAUSE HAVING
THAT LANGUAGE ON THE PATROL

02:06:22.908 --> 02:06:27.746
CAR'S RAISES THE LIABILITY TO
THE AGENCY I THINK IT'S TIME

02:06:27.813 --> 02:06:31.850
THAT WE CALL A BOWL OF BULL
AND SAY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:06:31.917 --> 02:06:34.653
AGENCIES HAVE GIVEN UP THE
RIGHT FOR LOCAL CONTROL LET'S

02:06:34.720 --> 02:06:38.257
COME UP WITH A STATE POLICY
THAT LOCAL AGENCIES CAN ADOPT

02:06:38.324 --> 02:06:41.894
THAT BALANCE GOOD PUBLIC POLICY
WITH GOOD LIABILITY THERE'S A

02:06:41.961 --> 02:06:47.666
BALANCING ACT IT'S NOT SOLELY
LIABILITY THE NEXT ISSUE IS

02:06:49.368 --> 02:06:53.072
WHY DOES THE STATE TELL US
TO CALL IT DON'T PROTECTIVE

02:06:53.138 --> 02:06:58.143
SERVICE WHEN WE SEE AN CRIME
AGAINST THE DISABILITY PERSON

02:06:58.210 --> 02:07:01.480
IF YOU SEE SOMEONE ROBBING A
BANK RECALL LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:07:01.547 --> 02:07:03.983
WE SHOULD BE CALLING LAW
ENFORCEMENT IF WE SEE ABUSE OF

02:07:04.049 --> 02:07:07.419
AN ELDER OR DISABILITY PERSON
NOT SOCIAL WORKERS THERE'S A

02:07:07.486 --> 02:07:09.855
PROBLEM WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING
