PLEASE GIVE YOUR ATTENTION TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER YOU'RE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS COLLEAGUES AS AS YOU KNOW WELL ONE YEAR AGO TODAY. I ALONG WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OF MY CONSTITUENTS WERE EVACUATED. AS A RESULT OF THE SPILLWAY FAILURES AT ORVILLE DAN. WE LEFT. NOT KNOWING IF WE WOULD EVEN HAVE A HOME TO RETURN TO. BUT WE CAME BACK VOWING NEVER AGAIN. THIS DISASTER JEOPARDIZE LIVES PROPERTY. AND CALIFORNIA'S WATER SUPPLY AND CONVEYANCE SYSTEM. AND SHOULD BE A WAKE UP CALL. FOR US ALL. THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY. AND INTEGRITY OF OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. THE GOVERNOR TOOK SOME GOOD INITIAL STEPS LAST YEAR AND. IN THE RESOURCES TRAILER BILL BY UPDATING OUR WRISTS CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM. AND DOING A COMPLETE RECONNAISSANCE OF OUR DAM SPILLWAYS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO SUPPLEMENT THE STEPS AB TWELVE SEVENTY. CO AUTHORED BY SENATOR NIELSEN. AND ALSO MY COLLEAGUE FROM STOCKTON. I HELPS TO ADDRESS DEFICIENCIES IN OUR DAM SAFETY INSPECTIONS AND EVALUATIONS. MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. OUR WORK IS NOT DONE BY PASSING THIS BILL TODAY BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. INCLUDING CHANGING THE DAM SAFETY STRUCTURE. AND CULTURE. ADD THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. IMPROVING AND UPGRADING. THE INFRASTRUCTURE AT ORVILLE DAM. AND MAKING THIS FACILITY TRULY WORK FOR OROVILLE. AND THE COMMUNITIES DOWNSTREAM. THE FORENSIC REPORT WHICH MANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN. IDENTIFIED THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE FAILURE. AND THAT REPORT. IDENTIFIED THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN MISSING. IN LIGHT OF THIS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT. INCLUDING INSPECTIONS. AB TWELVE SEVENTY WILL CODIFY. THE DAM SAFETY INSPECTION SCHEDULE. PRIOR TO THIS. THIS THOSE STATUTES SAID DAMN SHALL BE INSPECTED FROM TIME TO TIME. I'M SURE YOU CAN ALL AGREE WITH ME THAT WAS NOT SUFFICIENT LANGUAGE THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH AN INDEPENDENT DAM SAFETY AND RISK MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION. TO UPDATE DAM SAFETY PROTOCOLS. THESE PROTOCOLS MUST INCLUDE THINGS IDENTIFIED BY THE FORENSIC REPORT LIKE REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION. I THINK ALL MY COLLEAGUES FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS ISSUE AND MANY OTHERS RELATING TO THE OROVILLE DAM CRISIS AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. OF AB TWELVE SEVENTY THANK YOU MEMBERS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT IS A CO AUTHOR OF AB TWELVE SEVENTY. WE'VE HAD TO OVERSIGHT HEARINGS WE'VE BEEN UP TO THE DAM MULTIPLE TIMES TO REALLY TRY TO DECONSTRUCT WHAT HAPPENED UP THERE. EVERYBODY CAN AGREE THAT IS THE THE LYNCH PIN OF OUR CALIFORNIA WATER SUPPLY. TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT CATASTROPHIC OCCUR SHOULD BE A WAKE UP CALL FOR ALL OF US. AND TO CERTAINLY WHAT WE'VE HEARD IN THE HEARINGS AND EVERYWHERE ELSE IS THAT WHILE PEOPLE WERE DOING INSPECTIONS IT WAS DONE BASED ON ACCEPTING THE SCIENCE FROM SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. AS WE KNOW OUR KNOWLEDGE AS AS EVOLVED AS WE KNOW OUR INFRASTRUCTURE ALL OF IT IS CRUMBLING AND NEED IS IN THE NEED OF A LOT OF UPDATE. AND WE ALSO THE NEED TO LOOK BACK AT THE PLANS ARE NOT JUST CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WHAT IS THERE NOW BUT LOOK UNDERNEATH. THEY THOUGHT THAT DAM WAS ATTACHED A BEDROCK IT WAS NOT THAT WAS THE INITIAL PLANS SO TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK LATER. MEMBERS ALSO BE WHERE THIS ALL GOING TO COST. EXPEDITION RESOURCES AND TIME BUT IT NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR THE SAFETY OF CALIFORNIA WE CANNOT BE THE SIXTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CONTINUES TO CRUMBLE AROUND US. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND AS MY. COLLEAGUE FROM NICHOLAS SAYS THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE CONTINUE AND TO PROVE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND KEEP CALIFORNIA SAFE AND FUNCTIONING. SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE MISTER GALLAGHER DO YOU FEEL THE NEED TO CLOSE. OKAY WITHOUT THE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE. WHO DESIRE TO VOTE? ALL MEMBERS VOTE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE. MADAM CLERK PLEASE CLOSE THE ROLE IN TELLING THE VOTES SIXTY EIGHT. I KNOW ZERO ON THE URGENCY SIXTY EIGHT I KNOW ZERO ON THEM MEASURE THE SENATE AMENDMENTS ARE CONCURRED IN. ITEMS TWO THROUGH SIX WILL BE PASS AND RETAIN. THE CLERK WILL READ ITEM SEVEN ACR ONE FIFTY FIVE. ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ONE FIFTY FIVE BY SOME AMBER BAKER BELT OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S BIRTHDAY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER BAKER YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF ACR ONE FIFTY FIVE AND TO SAY IT IS A GREAT HONOR TO PRESENT THIS RESOLUTION. RECOGNIZING TODAY AS ABRAHAM LINCOLN DAY. EVERY MAKING WAS BORN THIS DAY IN EIGHTEEN OH NINE IN KENTUCKY. AND. I HAVE SOMETIMES WERE ASK THIS QUESTIONS FROM SCHOOL CHILDREN ARE FROM OTHERS WHO SAY IF YOU WERE TO SPEND TIME IN HISTORY. OR TIME WITH ANYONE IN HISTORY MAYBE THREE PEOPLE WHO WOULD THAT BE A MY LIST AS LONG AS I'M SURE YEARS MAYBE AS WELL BUT ABRAHAM LINCOLN IS ALWAYS ON THAT LIST. AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IS NOT ALL BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANT PATTY HAD HONOR HISTORY BUT I THINK YOU'LL BE SO FASCINATING TO HAVE KNOWN. WITHOUT PRESIDENT'S PERSONALITY WAS TRULY LIKE WHAT HIS DEMEANOR WAS HIS ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE ONE ON ONE IN PERSON WHICH WE WE. HAVEN'T AND WILL NEVER HAVE A CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE. AND TO SEE HOW MUCH WE MAY HAVE EXAGGERATED HIS GREATNESS IN TERMS OF HOW NICE A PERSON HE WAS HOW GIVING AND WHAT A GREAT COMMUNICATOR. BUT ONE THING YOU CAN NOT EXAGGERATE IS THE IMPACT HE HAD ON THE CAUSE OF LIBERTY. AND FREEDOM NOT JUST IN UNITED STATES BUT AROUND THE WORLD. AND WE SAW THAT THROUGH ONE OF HIS GREAT TRAITS WHICH IS COMPLETE AND TOTAL ABSTINENCE AND DETERMINATION TO KEEP OUR UNION TOGETHER. WE HAD EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO CUT AND RUN AND SAY WE'RE DONE. SO MUCH FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS. RE ASK THE QUESTION IS A COUNTRY THAT'S CONCEIVED IN LIBERTY. THE PROPOSITION THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL EQUAL ABLE TO ENSURE OR ARE WE DONE IN HISTORY. ARE WE ABLE TO HAVE A COUNTRY LIKE THAT OR DO WE NEED TO REVERT BACK TO THE WAY IT USED TO BE CAN WE SEE HIM IN PROGRESS IN FREEDOM. AND. HE WAS. ABLE TO EXPRESS THAT THAT MISSION OF OUR COUNTRY THE NEED TO COMPLETELY FULFILL. THE PROMISE AND THE TRUTH OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND THANKFULLY HE DID THAT BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS ROOM IS HERE FOR MANY PEOPLE HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON YOU BUT I THINK ALSO BECAUSE ABRAHAM LINCOLN DID THAT. AND PRESERVED OUR UNION. AND ALSO OF COURSE HE WAS COMPLETELY OBSTINATE IN FIGHTING TO END SLAVERY AND PASSED THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT. HE HAD MANY OPPORTUNITIES IN HISTORY TO HAVE PEACE WITH THE SOUTH WITHOUT PASSING THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT TO ABOLISH SLAVERY AND ALL FORMS OF INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE. HE COULD HAVE AGAIN CUT AND RUN. HE COULD HAVE SAID NO THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT I JUST WANNA KEEP THE UNION TOGETHER BUT HE WAS DETERMINED TO END SLAVERY. SO MUCH SO THAT HE HAD AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION WHEN HE WAS VERY MUCH OPPOSED TO AMENDMENTS HE THOUGHT THE CONSTITUTION IS FINE THE WAY IT WAS. AND EVEN SCIENCE THE ORIGINAL AND GROSSED COPY OF THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT PERSONALLY EVEN THOUGH THAT'S NOT REQUIRED. AND SO THEY FULLY HE WAS OBSTINATE AND DETERMINED IN KEEPING OUR UNION TOGETHER AND FIGHTING TO END SLAVERY. I THINK YOU CAN SEE IT IN ONE QUOTE THAT IS PARTICULARLY FAMOUS FOR WHICH IS BE SURE YOU PUT YOUR FEET IN THE RIGHT PLACE. AND STAND FIRM. DON'T GIVE UP. BUT WHAT'S ALSO INTERESTING ABOUT LINCOLN I THINK. IS THAT HE WAS JUST AS COMMITTED TO RECONCILIATION. AND HEALING AND GRACE AFTER YOU HAD FOUGHT THAT BATTLE FIRMLY KEPT YOUR FEET FIRM AND DEFEATED SOMEONE. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS. WHERE HE ACTUALLY SAYS WITH MALICE TOWARDS NINE AND CHARITY TOWARDS ALL WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THE CONFEDERATE WIDOW? WHOSE WHOSE HUSBAND OR WHO SIGNED FOUGHT TO KILL UNION SOLDIERS. AND THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY GRACE AND LEADERSHIP. AND THIS WASN'T JUST SOMETHING THAT HE. WAS SUGGESTING WE DO. WHEN. WHERE PERSONALLY SLIGHTED WHICH OFTEN HAPPENS IN POLITICS AND IT WASN'T JUST SOMETHING THAT WAS A A PRIVATE? OPPORTUNITY TO RECONCILE AND HAVE GRACE TOWARD SOMEONE ELSE HE WAS ON THE WORLD STAGE IN IN HIS SECOND INAUGURAL SUGGESTED THAT WE FORGIVE AND MOVE ON. REALLY REALLY HARD TO DO YOU. AND THANKFULLY HE DID BECAUSE AGAIN I THINK WE ARE ALL HERE THANKS TO ABRAHAM LINCOLN. AND I I BRING THIS RESOLUTION AGAIN THIS YEAR JUST AS I HAVE IN THE PAST WITH A REQUEST FOR PERMISSION TO USE A PROP WITHOUT OBJECTION. MY FATHER GOT ME THIS REPLICA OF LINCOLN AT THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL. WHEN I GRADUATED LAW SCHOOL. HE REALLY WAS HOPING THAT IT WOULDN'T BE A LAWYER BUT SO MUCH FOR THAT. AND SOMETHING IT'S URBAN LEGEND I THINK IT'S TRUE THERE'S A REASON WHY LINCOLN HAS A FAST CLOSED AT THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL AND THAT IS THAT DETERMINATION TO FIND YOUR PLACE IN THE RIGHT AND STAND. TOTALLY FIRM BUT HIS OTHER HAND IS OPEN. TOWARDS RECONCILIATION. REACHING OUT AND MOVING FORWARD AND SO I AM THANKFUL. TO BE HERE AND HAVE THE HONOR TO HAVE THIS RESOLUTION FOR US TO VOTE ON VERY GRATEFUL FOR LINCOLN AND THE THE LEGACY HAS NOT ONLY ON THE UNITED STATES BUT THE WORLD AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. AND YOU ASK FOR CO AUTHORS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. IN THE MIDST OF A BETTER CIVIL WAR. RECONCILE ALL IN THE PEACE. NEVER WAVERED. IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR HE RAN ON A UNITY TICKET WITH THE DEMOCRATS. FROM TENNESSEE. OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS I'VE SEEN THIS WORK ON VARIOUS PIECES OF LEGISLATION. SUCH AS JAMES GALLAGHER'S THAT WE HAD THIS MORNING. AND THE WORK ACROSS PARTY LINES. THAT IS SOMETHING LIKE AND STRIVE FOR AS PRESIDENT. TO FIND AREAS OF COMMON INTEREST AND WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE IT. PERMISSION TO READ BATUM SPEAKER WITHOUT OBJECTION. IN THE SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS LINCOLN SAID. WITH MALICE TOWARD DAWN. WITH CHARITY FOR ALL. WITH FIRMNESS IN THE RIGHT AS GOD GIVES US TO SEE THE RIGHT. WHETHER STRIVE ON TO FINISH THE WORK WE ARE IN. TO BIND UP THE NATION'S WOUNDS TO CARE FOR HIM WHO SHALL HAVE BORNE THE BATTLE. FOR HIS WIDOW AND HIS ORPHAN. TO DO ALL WHICH MAY ACHIEVE AND CHERISH. I JUST AND LASTING PEACE AMONG OURSELVES AND WITH ALL NATIONS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON ACR ONE FIFTY FIVE. I THINK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEEN SPEAKER MEMBERS. FOR THE DAY FOR SENIORS RISING. I ALSO RISE ON BEHALF OF ACR AND ONE FIFTY FIVE IN JUST A UP A PERSONAL REFLECTION WITH WITH NOTHING TO READ BUT. BUT WORDS JUST THAT THAT STRIKE ME AS I THINK ABOUT LINCOLN. AS ELECTED OFFICIALS WE ARE FACED IN SOME INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT SITUATIONS IF WE'RE LUCKY BECAUSE FACING DIFFICULT SITUATIONS. ALLOWS YOU THE ABILITY TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A VERY HARD AND DIFFICULT CHOICE ABOUT SOMETHING. A REFLECT WHEN I WAS ON THE STUCK CITY COUNCIL AND WE WERE. CAREENING INTO BANKRUPTCY. AND WE HAD HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS AND. DAYS AND WEEKS AND MONTHS OF PUBLIC TESTIMONY AND. A LOT A LOT HAVE JUST DIED VERY INTENSE DEBATE CRITICISM. YOU NAME IT WE HAD IT I WAS I WAS HUNG IN EFFIGY OUTSIDE A CITY HALL WHAT'S. AND A TIME TO THINK DO I JUST DO THE EASY THING. FOR SOME PEOPLE WERE VERY VOCAL. OR I DO THE HARD THING BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT'S THE GOOD OF THE WHOLE. AND IT'S HARD TO STAND IN THAT PLACE AND IT'S HARD TO LOOK YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR EVERY DAY AND SAY MY DOING THE RIGHT THING. DURING THAT TIME I HAVE ENOUGH TO GET TRIP BACK TO DC TO SPEAK AT A CONFERENCE HOSTED AN ACADEMIC THAN. A AND I WENT TO HIS SUMMER HOME WHICH IS RIGHT OUTSIDE OF DC. AND I WAS STRUCK WITH THE STORIES THAT THAT SUMMER HOME A LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE OF TOWN IS WHERE THE WOUNDED SOLDIERS. CAMPED OUT. VIDEO TO RIDE SIX MILES INTO TOWN EVERY DAY IN A WAGON AND GO BY CAMPS AND HOSPITALS OF SOLDIERS AND PEOPLE DYING. LEGS BLOWN OFF ALL AROUND HIM AS HE JUST KEPT GOING. PEOPLE CALLING UPON HIM TO STOP AND KNOWING THAT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR THE GREATER GOOD. YOU INCREDIBLE HARD THINGS THAT WE FACE SOMETIMES AS IT LOOKED AT OFFICIALS AND SO I THINK IT WOULD TAKE ANYTHING FROM MY FROM ABRAHAM LINCOLN. JUST TAKE A SOMETIMES THE GREATER GOOD IS SO HARD TO GET THROUGH. AND THE INSTANT GRATIFICATION FOR US TO STEP AWAY AND TO TURN OUR HEADS IS SO COMPELLING BUT IF WE HOLD THAT LINE. HEARD ON THE NEWS TODAY THAT MY OF MY CITY WENT FROM BEING A AND THE FIRST BANKRUPTCY THE MOST MIDDLE PET PLACE AMERICA THE MOST VIOLENT CITY IN AMERICA TO THE SECOND MOST PHYSICAL. FISCALLY HEALTHY CITY IN THE US STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH A TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD YOUNG MAN FROM. AT THE SOUTH SIDE NOW AS LEADING US AS MAYOR SO IT WE PROVE PERSEVERE AS DID LINCOLN AND SHOWING US A PAST THAT EVEN IF IT'S HARD. THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE OTHER SIDE I THINK WE ALL DO BETTER TO SERVE IN HIS IMAGE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND ACR ONE FIFTY FIVE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY YOU'RE RECOGNIZED.

THAT IS THE EAGLE. ABOVE A SHIELD REPRESENT AMERICAN UNION. AND TWO FIGURES CLASPING THEIR HANDS. IT IS A SYMBOL OF UNION. AND THE CALIFORNIA IS A PART OF THE UNION. WHEN WE ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE THE STREET LOOKING FROM CHICORY. WE NOW SEE THAT SAME SHIELD IT'S NOW OBSCURED BECAUSE WHAT IS. A PARENT NOW IS THIS IS THE GREAT SEAL OF CALIFORNIA. BEING ADDED TO THE UNION SHIELD. AND IT DOMINATED THE UNION BECAUSE OF THE GOLD WEALTH OF CALIFORNIA EIGHTEEN FIFTY. WE CONTINUED DOMINATE THE UNION. BUT. SO IN THIS BUILDING ITSELF WE REMEMBER THE WORK OF LINCOLN. PRESERVING THE UNION. THE OPEN ARMS TO OTHER STATES TO BE A PART OF THE UNION AND CALIFORNIA'S SINGULAR ROLE WITHIN THE UNION.

ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ONE SIXTY SIX BY FAMILY MEMBER BAKER RELATIVE TO INTERNATIONAL DAY OF WOMEN AND GIRLS IN SCIENCE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAKER YOU'RE RECOGNIZED FEELING UNUSUALLY TALKATIVE TODAY THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. I LIKE TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF ACR ONE SIXTY SIX AND ON BEHALF OF LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS PRESENT THIS AND ALSO AS A MOM OF A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL WHO LOVES MATH AND THANKFULLY IS MUCH BETTER AT IT THAN I AM. I IT IS TO RECOGNIZE A WOMEN AND GIRLS IN SCIENCE THE IDEA FOR OR AN INTERNATIONAL DAY OF WOMEN AND GIRLS AND SCIENCE WAS CREATED ON FEBRUARY ELEVENTH. JUSTIN TWENTY FIFTEEN DURING THE FIRST WORLD WOMEN'S HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT FORUM. WHICH WAS ORGANIZED BY THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE OR NATIONAL TRUST AND UNITED NATIONS DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS. THE GOAL OF THIS DAY IS TO EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND REPRESENTATION OF GENDERS IN STEM FIELDS. AND WHILE IN RECENT YEARS A NUMBER OF WOMEN INVOLVED IN SCIENTIFIC FIELDS HAS INCREASED WOMEN STILL ONLY ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN THIRTY PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S RESEARCHERS. AND EVEN LOWER PERCENTAGE AT HIGHER DECISION MAKING LEVELS IN SCIENCE. AND WHILE RIVER RECEIVE OVER HALF OF BACHELOR DEGREES AWARDED IN BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES THEY RECEIVE FAR FEWER IN COMPUTER SCIENCE ENGINEERING PHYSICAL SCIENCES AND MATHEMATICS. SO THE NEED FOR GENDER EQUALITY IN STEM FIELDS IS NOT ONLY A MATTER OF FAIRNESS. BUT IT'S A MATTER OF LOST OPPORTUNITY FOR WOMEN FOR GIRLS AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE WHEN THEY MISS OUT ON CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WOMEN CAN MAKE IN OUR SCIENCE FIELDS. I AM SO THE ACR CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT BUT IT'S ALSO TO REMIND US. OF JUST HOW MUCH WOMEN HAVE ROCKED IN SCIENCE. MARY CURRY WAS THE FIRST WOMAN TO WIN THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR HER GROUNDBREAKING RESEARCH IN RADIO ACTIVITY. ROSALIND FRANKLIN WAS A CHEMIST AND EXTRA CRYSTALLOGRAPHY HER BEST KNOWN FOR HER CRUCIAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE DOUBLE HELIX STRUCTURE OF DNA AS WELL AS PIONEERING THE USE OF XRAY DIFFRACTIVE FRACTION. AND LISE MEITNER WAS A PHYSICIST WHO IS ONE OF THE FIRST SCIENTISTS TO DISCOVER NUCLEAR FISSION AN IRANIAN. GERTRUDE ELIANE WAS A BIOCHEMIST AND PHARMACOLOGIST TO DEVELOP THE FIRST A MUNICIPAL S. OF DRUG FOR ORGAN TRANSPLANTS AS WELL AS OTHER DRUGS TREATING MALARIA AND AIDS. AND AUGUSTA AIDED KING KNOLL WAS AN ENGLISH MATHEMATICIAN AND WRITER WHO WROTE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE FIRST COMPUTER PROGRAM IN THE MID EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF WOMEN AND GIRLS AND STEM AND SUPPORT THOSE PROGRAMS IF YOU HAVE IT HAS SPENT EXPAND YOUR HORIZON PROGRAM IN YOUR DISTRICT. WHERE WOMEN AND GIRLS COME TOGETHER TO DO SCIENCE PROJECTS IN ADVANCE IN RESEARCH AND STEM I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT THAT PROGRAM AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THINK YOU? THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMAN YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF ACR ONE SIXTY SIX. I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN RAMON FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD AS A STEM SHARE I'M GLAD TO ADD MY VOICE IN ECHO THE SENTIMENTS THAT YOU'VE HEARD. ABOUT HOW WE MUST DO ALL THAT WE CAN CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS IN THE FIELDS OF SCIENCE. BUT WE KNOW THAT THESE DISPARITIES HAVE EXISTED AND IT'S WELL DOCUMENTED AND IT IS INEXCUSABLE IT'S TIME FOR ACTION. OUGHT TO MAKE CHANGE WE MUST DO A BETTER JOB OF ENSURING THAT SCIENCE EDUCATION AND RELATED CAREERS ARE ACCESSIBLE. A THIS YEAR WHAT THE END OF LAST YEAR WE STARTED WITH OUR STAND HEARINGS. AND WE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH THE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS TO LIFT UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR GIRLS AND WOMEN. IN THE FIELDS OF STEM I LIKE TO THANK THE COMMISSION INTEC NET AND THE CALIFORNIA STEM NETWORK WHO CAME FOR WITH US. REPORTER NUMBER OF MENTORSHIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS FROM ACROSS THE STATE. I LIKED ALSO THINK APPLE WHO CAME FORWARD TO PROVIDED A WORKSHOP ON HOW TO DO CODING FOR MANY OF THE YOUNG WOMEN WHO CAME TO BE IN THE WORKSHOP. ON THAT DAY THERE ARE PROJECTIONS THAT THEY'LL BE OVER A MILLION JOBS IN THE STEM FIELD IN JUST A FEW YEARS AND MAYBE ONLY HALF OF THE APPLICANTS. FOR THOSE JOBS LET'S TAKE UP OUR LEADERSHIP AND TAKE UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO PREPARE OUR TODAY'S STUDENTS TO BE THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW. IN TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S EQUAL ACCESS AND GENDER EQUALITY FOR GIRLS AND WOMEN TO BE IN THE FIELDS OF STAMP AND AND SCIENCE OVERALL I URGE YOUR SUPPORT. OF ACR ONE SIXTY SIX.
