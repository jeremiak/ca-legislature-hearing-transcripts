TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SO I ASK THAT EVERYONE PLEASE BE PATIENT AS THE VARIOUS PANELISTS ANOTHER REPRESENTATIVES RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS. WITH THAT I WANT TO ASK OUR FIRST SPEAKER MARK NEWTON DEPUTY LEGISLATIVE ANALYST WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. TO PLEASE BEGIN WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE HEALTH PROPOSALS IN THE MAY REVISION. MISTER NEWTON IS JOINING US REMOTELY VIA TELECONFERENCE THE LA- HAS PROVIDED A HANDOUT WHICH IS POSTED ON THE SUB COMMITTEES WEBSITE. AND WITH MISTER NOONAN WILL REFERENCE AS WE GO THROUGH THE PRESENTATION THANK YOU FOR JOINING US MR IN PLEASE BEGIN YOU ARE READY. MISTER CHIR YOU CAN ASK YEAH I NEED TO CALL FROM THE DEVICE. MR NOON I BELIEVE YOU'RE ON MUTE. IS THAT THE GOOD MISTER CHAIR THAT'S PERFECT. GOOD OF PAUL TRIES FOR THAT- SO AGAIN MARK KNEW DIDN'T LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO PRESENT AN OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR HEALTH PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET UP MAY REVISION BUDGET AND I'LL BE FOLLOWING THE PRESENTATION AT THE HEAD OF TATIAN THAT THE CHAIR REFERENCE. SO IN TWO TO PAGE ONE OF THE HEAD OF THIS GIVES THE MEMBERS A BIG. OF THE GENERAL FUND HEALTH BUDGET BETWEEN JANUARY AND MAY AND AS YOU'LL SEE IT'S A IT'S A ROUGHLY THREE BILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION IN THE GENERAL FUND BUDGET BETWEEN JANUARY AND MAY ALMOST AND CONCENTRATED- IN IN MEDI CAL ASSISTANCE. THIS IS A TEN PERCENT- REDUCTION WHICH IS FAIRLY OF THE GENERAL REDUCTIONS ACROSS VARIOUS SET STATE POLICY AREAS. BUT IF WE TURN TO PAGE TWO- AND THIS IS QUITE RELEVANT IN LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE IN TERMS OF TOTAL FUNDING FOR HELP PROGRAMS. TO REIMAGINE TOTAL FUNDING WE'RE INCLUDING- THE GENERAL FUND OBVIOUSLY BUT FEDERAL FUNDS AND SPECIAL FUNDS. AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER- FINDS THAT THE BUDGET ACTUALLY THE HEALTH BUT IT ACTUALLY DOES INCREASE BETWEEN JANUARY AND MAY. BY ABOUT EIGHT POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT'S ROUGHLY AN 8% 28% IN. THAT INCREASE VERY MUCH REFLECTS. ENHANCED FEDERAL FUNDING AND THAT IN THE ENHANCE FEDERAL FUNDING IS COMING FROM A FEW PLACES AND I AGAIN LARGELY CONCENTRATED IN THE- MEDI CAL. ASSISTANCE THE PROGRAM. IT WAS ENHANCE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR MEDI CAL IN THE FAMILIES FOR CORONA- REALLY RUN A VIRUS RELIEF ACT- THAT PROVIDES A SIX POINT TWO PERCENTAGE POINT. INCREASE IN IN EFFECT PARTICIPATION IN MEDI CAL DURING THE TERM OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. BUT ANOTHER KEY- REASON WHY THE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE GOING UP IS BECAUSE OF THE RECENT FEDERAL APPROVAL THE MAN CARE ORGANIZED ATTACKS THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED. AND AT MS TOP DOES PROVIDE GENERAL FUND RELIEF BUT ALSO GENTLY. FEDERAL IS. KEEP I WOULD LIKE MAKE ABOUT FUNDS IS AS YOU SEE IT'S THAT THE THAT THE BUDGET TO IS ABLE TO BALANCE TO A LARGE DEGREE BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED FEDERAL FUNDING BUT THE FEDERAL FUNDING DOES NOT LAST THE FEDERAL FUNDING TO LAST FOREVER. AND IF I BACK TO THE TO THE TO THE GREAT RECESSION- THERE WAS ALSO ENHANCE FEDERAL FUNDING- AS A RESULT OF THE ARE OF LEGISLATION THE FEDERAL ECONOMIC STIMULUS LEGISLATION THAT ACTUALLY WHY TO. ABOUT ELEVEN POINT 6%PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE FEDERAL PARTICIPATION CAL NOT LASTED FOR. TWO AND A HALF YEARS AND THAT AFTER THE FUNDING. ON THE WAS ACTUALLY A FAIRLY BIG GUY IN THE MEDI CAL ANOTHER BUDGETS AND NOT HAVE TO BE. ADDRESSED BY FOR SOME FAIRLY MAJOR BUDGET QUESTIONS SO THE POINT HERE IS THAT- WHAT THE FEDERAL FUNDING CERTAINLY. TODAY IT WILL LAST FOREVER AND NOT SEE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER SORT OF ON GOING BUDGET SOLUTIONS- THAT WILL HELP TO MITIGATE A BIG FUNDING DROP IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS WHEN MANY ENHANCE FIVE. BEING THE WAY. BRING TO PAGE. HANDOUT I'D LIKE TO JUST GIVE THE MEMBERS A BRIEF OVERVIEW CROSSED WALKING THE MEDI CAL BUDGET FROM JANUARY TO MAY. BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK. AT AT THE FIRST PAGE AND YOU'LL SEE- A COUPLE MILLION TO OUR- LOOK BILLION DOLLARS TO REDUCTION IN THAT HOUSE- IN THE GENERAL FUND. DOT NET IT'S A WHOLE COMPLEX SET OF CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING BETWEEN MAY AND RESTRICT BRAND MAY. AND MANY OF THOSE CHANGES- REP ADDED COSTS. ARE INTEREST OTHER OFFSET PAGE ROAD LIKE TO CROSS MEMBERS PROVIDE THE PROCESS. MEMBERS FOR YOU SEE WHAT I KNOW ON AND ON. SOME IMPORT POINT OF STE CHANGES. CHANGES IN OTHER SERVE ON ANTICIPATED COST SO ALL OR JUST- GO THROUGH THAT QUICKLY FOR THE MEMBERS SO THE JANUARY MEDI CAL BUDGET STARTS AT ROUGHLY JUST OF THE WONDER TWELVE THE SIX BILLION DOLLARS AND TO PROJECT TO MAY THE FIRST THING THAT YOU'LL SEE IS THAT. THIS A DISCRETION. WAS WERE REMOVED THE- ADMINISTRATION I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THESE LATER BUT YOU'LL SEE THAT TOTALS A LITTLE OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THE VERY ONE THE DELAY OF THE COW AND PROPOSAL THAT WAS PROPOSED IN. IN YOU KNOW OF VERY STE. AND SERVE AT COSTS. AND THE FIRST ADDED COST IS HIGHER PROJECTED CASELOAD- IN MEDI CAL WHICH YOU'LL SEE IS CLOSE TO. CLOSE TO THREE THREE BILLION DOLLARS ON WHICH IS VERY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT IN THAT CASE LOAD IS THAT REFLECT. THE COVERT NINETEEN. DID IMPACT ON ON CASELOAD. I JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT HERE AND IT'S SOMETHING OUR OFFICE IS CERTAINLY A VALUE WAITING- IN AN IN DEPTH WAY IS. ARE THE GOVERNOR'S CASE LOW PROJECTIONS FOR FROM CAL AND OUR POOL AREA ANALYSIS FINDS THAT WE ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF NEW. ARE MEDIC ROWLY THAT WILL COME ON BOARD AS A RESULT OF THE OF THE PANDEMIC BUT WE'RE DIFFERS DEFINITELY IS IN THE COST OF THAT NEW CASELOAD AND- WE'RE NOT EVALUATING WITH MINISTRATIONS. ASSUMPTIONS AND DO THINK IT IS THAT HAS BEEN HAVE BEEN RE UP OVER. AND RISING JUST LOOK FOR ALL. HAVE SOME RIGHT COSTA. WORD NOT FRONT. CAN YOU SEE IS THE TO AND NOT IS A REPAIR OF- TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF CLAIMING FOR MEDICAL SERVICES THAT THAT APPEAR TO BE SERVE IMPROPERLY CLAIMED AS A RESULT OF. THE A CLICK CLAIMS NOT HAVE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE MEDICAL SERVICES THAT'S ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR ADJUSTMENT. AND IT REFLECTS THE WE FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS OF THIS IT CLAIMING BUT ALSO AS A PERSPECTIVE. ELEMENT TO THIS AS WELL AND THEY BUDGET GOING FORWARD REFLECTS A JUDGE ADJUSTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- THE CLIP IS PROPER. THEN MOVING ON TO SOME OF THE SAVINGS TIED YOU'LL SEE. SOME OF THE BIG TICKET ITEMS OF THE ENHANCE FEDERAL FUNDING IN THE ROLE THAT THAT PLAYS THE ROLE THAT HE- MCO TAX PLAYS IN TERMS OF REDUCING THE GENERAL FUND- AND THEN YOU'LL SEE NUMBER OF THE BUDGET SOLUTIONS. THAT WERE PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. OKAY ABOUT LATER AND WHEN YOU SOME ALL THIS OP YOU'LL SEE THE- THE MEDI CAL GENERAL FUND BUDGET AT THAT JUST A LITTLE OVER TWENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN. IN MAY SO A LOT OF COMPLEXITIES- SERVE ON THE PLUS THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT THIS PROVIDE USER THE GENERAL- OVERVIEW OF THE- THE GENERAL FUND BUDGET CHANGES IN MEDICARE ALL. SO TURN EACH FIVE ALL LIKE TO JUST GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE WITH THE MAJOR JANUARY PROPOSALS. ARE IN MAY- ACROSS HEALTH PROGRAMS AND FOR THE MOST PART BE THE DISCRETIONARY THE BIG DISCRETIONARY PROPOSALS IN IN JANUARY WERE HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN AT THAT- AT MAY. NOT LIKE TO JUST START ABOUT WHAT WAS RETAIN AT AT NAY. AND THE CHART HIGHLIGHTS THE- ON PAGE FIVE THE MAJOR PROPOSALS THAT WERE RETAINED AT MAY REVISION- THERE THERE ARE OTHERS I SHOULD NOTE AND- A LOT OF SMALL LITTLE PROPOSALS THAT. HAVE BEEN RETAINED SO PROBABLY THE TOTAL AMOUNT THAT'S RETAIN CERTAIN IS OVER SIX MILLION OR SO BUT THIS LESS THE MAJOR. WE WILL SEE THEIR THEY'RE FAIRLY SMALL IN- IN IN SIZE. TURNING TO- PAGE SIX OF THE THEY HAND OUT YOU'LL SEE THE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN BY THE GOVERNOR I'D SAT AT AT MAY REVISION- TOTALING JUST A LITTLE UNDER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS- FOCUS VERY MUCH MEDI CAL AND- THE INDEFINITE DELAY OF THE CALENDAR PROPOSAL IS THE BIG TICKET ITEM- BUT ALSO VERY SIGNIFICANT IS THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE GENERATOR PROPOSED GOVERNOR. TO FULL SCOPE MEDIC. AND YOU'LL SEE A SELECTION OF OTHER BUT RELATIVELY SMALLER AT PROPOSALS THAT WERE ALSO WITHDRAWN ACCESS AT ME REVISION. SO THEN OF TURNING TO- PAGE SIX HERE- SKEWS ME. PAGE. GIVING SURF PAGE SEVEN OF THE OF THE HANDOUT EXCUSE ME OF THERE WERE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WERE MODIFIED AS WELL AT AT AT MAY REVISION SO RETAIN TO SOME DEGREE BUT BUT TO THE THAT THE SAVINGS OR SAVINGS WERE CREATED BY REDUCING THE SIZE OF THE PROPOSALS ARE SO THESE ARE SIMPLY A MODEST ACROSS THE STATE BUDGET- C. AS AGAIN TOTALING ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. SO PROBABLY OF MOST INTEREST IS ARE THE BUDGET SOLUTIONS THAT ARE PROPOSED- BY THE GOVERNOR IT MAY REVISION. WHICH IS THE- THE SUMMARY CHART ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE HANDOUT YOU SEE THIS TOTALS TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF AS SOON GENERAL FUND SAVINGS. AND THE BULK OF THESE ARE SUBJECT TO THE- THE TRIGGER OFF IF FEDERAL FUNDS ARE RECEIVED TO. TO ACCOMMODATE THE FRONT OR THE PROGRAM ATTICA REDUCTION BEING RESTORED. JUST BRIEFLY SUMMARIZING THE MEDI CAL LOCAL ASSISTANCE ITEMS THE- A FEW BIG TICKET ITEMS THE LARGEST IS THE ELIMINATION- REDUCTION OF MOST NOT ALL PROPOSITION THE SIX FUNDED SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT. OF IN THIS. THAT IS ASSUMING ARE. AT THE GOVERNOR SOON AS A- GENERAL FUND SAVINGS ABOUT ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS FROM THAT- THE REASON WHY THIS IS ON A GENERAL FUND SAVINGS CHART IS THAT SET. OF FUNDING THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS WITH- PROP FIFTY SIX OUT NOT FUNDING EXCUSE ME SIR PROVIDES A THAN A GENERAL FUND BENEFIT BECAUSE THE TOP OF IT PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING THEN CAN BE USED TO JUST OFFSET THE NATURAL GROWTH. IT YET CAL PROGRAMS WHICH ATTRACT OFFSET TO HAVE A GENERAL SORT OF THE MEDI CAL THE MEDI CAL BUDGET. THE VERY FUND TRANSFERS IN AND A FEW NEWS OR REVENUE SOURCES TOTALING ABOUT HALF A BILLION DOLLARS- SOME ADJUSTMENTS CAPTIVITY RATE ADJUSTMENTS IN THE MANAGED CARE WORLD- THE ELIMINATION OF OPTIONAL BENEFITS. AND IN VARIOUS OTHER- THROUGH SMALLER A SMALLER REDUCTIONS BUT THE BIG TICKET ITEMS. THE ONES THAT- JUST MENTIONED IN THE MEDIC HOW THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. CAN AND JUST TURNING BRIEFLY TO PAGE NINE THE MAY REVISION DOES INCLUDE A FEW NEW OCT AUGMENTATIONS- AND FOR THE MOST PART THESE AUGMENTATIONS IN THE HEALTH WORLD ARE ARE TARGETED GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATIONS THAT RELATE TO THE- POPULAR AIMED AT RESPONDING TO THE COVERT NINETEEN- CRISIS- IN MOST THESE AUGMENTATIONS ALSO TO LEVERAGE A FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS SO IN THE MATTER HOW WORLD WE HAVE JUST FOR NINETEEN CASTING. COVERAGE FOR THE ON AND- TEMPORARY INCREASE THE LONG TERM CARE FACILITY RATES- AN INCREASE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PAYMENTS AND- AND EXPANSION OF HOSPITAL- PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY. IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORLD WE HAVE A- ROUGHLY A SIX MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION- TO INCREASE THE LABORATORY- CAPACITY AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPACITY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SO TURNING TO THE FINAL SECTION OF THE OF THE HAND ARE JUST LIKE TO TALK FOR A MINUTE OR TWO FOR THAT TO THE MEMBERS OF A KEY CONSIDERATIONS. EVALUATING THROUGH THE HEALTH BUDGET SOLUTIONS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR- THIS SAID COMMENTARY HERE IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUE GET GINNY BALLOT YESTERDAY AND ON THE HUMAN SERVICES SIDE. SOLDIERS HIGHLIGHT TO SORT OF A- A FEW THINGS HERE THE FIRST IS JUST ON THE CASELOAD ESTIMATE SIDE THIS IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT- CONSIDERATION FOR THE FOR THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE- THE MEDI CAL CASELOAD IN THE HEALTH- ROUND IS. WHICH FOR THE MOST SECOND EVER OF INK INC COSTS. IN HEALTH PROGRAM COSTS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. SO UNDERSTANDING THE ADMINISTRATION'S ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING THE CASE SO THAT'S MEANT WILL BE VERY KEY. AND AS I MENTIONED THE- OUR OFFICE WILL BE- ADVISING THE- THE LEGISLATURE ON THE MINISTRATIONS ESTIMATES AND- IN. PROPS THE RECOMMENDING I HAVE A REVISED A REVISION TO THAT ESTIMATE. SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT THE GOVERNOR IS MAKING CLEARLY IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THAT THE TRADE OFFS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS- A KEY QUESTION TO ASK IN TERMS OF ALL PROPOSALS IS IT WHAT IS THE IMPACT. OF THE PROPOSAL SORT OF ON A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND THAT AND ALSO ON- AN INDIVIDUAL'S PERSONAL PERSONAL ECONOMIC SITUATION. AND IN THE MAJOR POINT HERE IS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROPOSAL'S ARE NOT WORKING AT CROSS PURPOSES. WITH THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE THE- AND- JUST TO GIVE JUST ONE PROPS SERVE SMALL EXAMPLE BUT IMPORTANT EXAMPLE OF THIS- THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING A REDUCTION TO THE BLACK- INFANT HEALTH PROGRAM NOT A TOTAL ELIMINATION. BUT BUT IT BUT A SIGNIFICANT TO A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION. POINT HERE BUT THE BLOCKING HEALTH PROGRAM IS A PRO THAT IS SIGNED ARE. AND. AND WITH THE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS THERE'S QUITE- A LOT OF- IN ALICE'S THAT POINTS TO DISPARITIES INCREASING WITH THE PANDEMIC- AND THUS. IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHETHER THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO- TO AS. IT DOES APPEAR TO RUN COUNTER TO EFFORTS TO REDUCE DISPARITIES. ANOTHER ISSUE IS- I'D LIKE TO POINT WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD OF ACHIEVING THE SAVINGS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS AND I DO POINT TO IMPORTANT ISSUE IN TERMS OF THE LEGISLATURE WANTING TO ENSURE. THAT ANY SAVINGS PROPOSAL BY THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT PUT AT RISK- JEOPARDIZE TO THE LOSS OF FEDERAL FUNDING. AND OUR OFFICE IS CURRENTLY- EVALUATING ISSUE IN THE CONTEXT OF SOME OF THE PROPOSED MEDI CAL REDUCTIONS IN TERMS OF NATIONAL OPTIONAL BENEFIT IN SOME ALRP BUILD. IF ARE IS THAT WOULD BE A BIG PRICE TAG IF. IT IF A LOT OF FEDERAL FUNDS ARE ARE JEFFREY I NOTE THAT THERE A CONTROL SECTION IN THE BUDGET THT THE COUPLE HAS PROPOSED WOULD- SET ASIDE CERTAIN PROPOSED REDUCTIONS IF A FEDERAL FUNDING IT IS JEOPARDIZED. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION I LOOK FOR TO BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS FOR THE MEMBERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER NEWTON NOW I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. MICHELLE BOSS THE UNDERSECRETARY OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY PLEASE PROVIDE US WITH THE GOVERNOR'S FRAMING AND PERSPECTIVE. MRS BOSS IS JOINING US IN THIS VIDEO ROOM MISS BOSS PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR. AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE.

DOCTORS ANGEL THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SEASON FINALE THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT PUBLIC HEALTH AND STEPHANIE CLINTON AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS. THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT MAY REVIEW. AND SO DIFFERENT FROM WHERE WE WERE IN JANUARY. ARE JANUARY PLANTS TO MAKE BOLD INVESTMENTS TO ADVANCE KEY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PRIORITIES INCLUDING QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. REGARDLESS OF YOUR AGE YOUR INCOME. TRANSFORMING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND GIVING A HAD UP TO THOSE WHO STRUGGLE WITH HOMELESSNESS HAVE BEEN PUT ON HOLD. HOWEVER WE ARE STILL GUIDED BY THE VALUES. EVEN THOUGH WE FACE A VERY DIFFICULT ECONOMIC SITUATION. THE EFFECTS OF KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC ARE UNPRECEDENTED IN MODERN TIMES. IT'S CAUSED ENORMOUS HARDSHIP FOR FAMILIES BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE WORLD THE UNITED STATES AND HERE AT HOME IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THE STATE COVERED NINETEEN HAS SWIFTLY BROUGHT ON AN ECONOMIC RECESSION I DECLINE IN TAX REVENUES RAPIDLY RISING HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CASE LOADS AND BILLIONS IN ADDITIONAL COSTS TO COMBAT THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PROJECT IT SHORTFALL OF FIFTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS. MR DIDN'T DID A THOROUGH JOB REVIEWING OR DETAIL ARE PROPOSALS IN DETAIL I'D LIKE TO SPEAK QUICKLY TO OUR APPROACH IN DEVELOPING THE MAYOR VISION TO ADDRESS THE SHORTFALL. AND THE PRINCES WILL THREE USED TO GUIDE THE THESE PROPOSALS. OUR PRIMARY GOAL WAS TO PROTECT ELBIT ELIGIBILITY FOR PROGRAMS WE MAINTAIN MEDICAL PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY INCLUDING THE OPTIONAL ADULT AFFORDABLE CARE ACT EXPANSION. AND EXPANSION UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN A MEDI CAL WE ALSO MAINTAIN CAL WORKS ELIGIBILITY. ANOTHER PRINCIPLE. TO ORDER BILL IF THAT WERE PROPOSED AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. OF THE WE'VE DELAYED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CAL AIMED WE PUT ALSO DEFERRED OUR OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABLE AFFORDABILITY AND THE REFORM OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. WE'VE ALSO- CANCELLED THE CREATION OF A NEW COMMUNITY BASED MODEL TO TREAT INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL INDIVIDUALS ARE COMMUNITY CARE COLLABORATIVE PROJECT. WE'VE ALSO AT CANCEL TO REDUCE SPENDING THAT WAS ADDED IN THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BUDGET.

THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY WE LOOKFORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO PASS A BUDGET DURING HIS VERY DIFFICULT DIFFICULT ECONOMIC TIMES. THANK YOU MRS BOSS. NOW I'D LIKE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ADAM DORSEY WHO'S JOINING US FROM THE WITNESS VIDEO ROOM. TO PLEASE PROVIDE US WITH THE FRAMING AND PERSPECTIVE OF THE MAY REVISION. MISTER DORSEY IS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES PROGRAM BUDGET MANAGER FOR HEALTH. AND HUMAN SERVICES. MISTER DORSEY PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. YEAH OVER. YESTERDAY I. THE WOULD COME ALL THE WAY HOLD ON ONE SECOND MISTER DORSEY WE APPEAR TO HAVE SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. CAN WE HAVE YOU SAY TEST ONE TWO THREE FOUR MISTER DORSEY. ONE NUMBER FIVE ONE. FIVE SO I THINK GIVEN THE HAVE OVERVIEW WITH THAT I PROVIDED THE COMMITTEE YESTERDAY- THE OVERVIEW THAT WAS JUST PROVIDED BY THE HEALTH SERVICES AGENCY AND BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OF KEEP MY COMMENTS VERY BRIEF. IF WE MENTIONED THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT MAY REVISION. OF WITH SOME VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS AND THE AND THE- REALLY UNIQUE AND CHALLENGING SITUATION THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN IS A STATE AS A COUNTRY. AND THE I'LL MAKE MYSELF AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER DORSEY IN WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO NOW IT UP OPEN IT UP TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO ASK QUESTIONS- I AM GOING TO ASK YOU. CAN TO TRY TO DIRECTOR QUESTIONS AND LIMIT THEM ONLY SO THAT WE MAY. ENCOURAGE AS MUCH PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AS WE CAN. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS WOULD WANT TO START. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- I WASN'T ABLE TO BE ATTACHED THE EARLY PARTY HEARING YESTERDAY SORRY IT'S THE IF IT'S OKAY I'D LIKE TO MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS ABOUT SOMETHING SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY. OUR I GUESS SO. OBVIOUSLY WE ALL WERE LIVING IN REALLY REALLY- DIFFICULT TIMES AND I DON'T HAVE TO SAY I WAS PRETTY SHOCKED BY SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE SEEN IN THE BUDGET- AND CONCERNED AND SO I'M HOPING THIS WILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ANSWERED OF THE CERTAINLY ON THE HEALTH SIDE TODAY BECAUSE I FIND MYSELF SCRATCHING MY HEAD ON SOME THINGS ARE. BUT I WANT TO DO I DO WANT TO SAY JUST ONE CATEGORY- AND THERE WERE SO MANY THAT WE HEARD OF YESTERDAY AND PUBLIC COMMENT THAT I WAS ABLE TO GET INTO LATE. OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS BUT RIGHT NOW OF OUR OUR SENIOR POPULATION AND JUST TO USE AS AN EXAMPLE FOR SO MANY OTHERS ABOUT BUT LET ABOUT THIS IN THE IN THE TIME. THE I. P. THAT WE HARD. NAY THE M. S. S. P. AND ESSENTIALLY THE SEA BASS PROGRAM. AT A TIME WHEN IT'S CLEAR THAT IT'S NOT REALLY SAFE TO BE IN A NURSING HOME OR NOT ASSERT SAFE AS WE'D LIKE IT TO BE IS REALLY REALLY TROUBLING- THE M. S. S. P. PROGRAM WHICH I HAPPEN TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THAN SEA BASS. THEY TAKE A PROVIDE SERVICES FOR. ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND LESS THAN TWELVE THOUSAND ARE FRAGILE MEDICALLY FRAGILE SENIORS. IN THE IDEA BEHIND THIS PROGRAM. IS TO KEEP THEM FROM HAVING TO GO INTO A NURSING HOME. AND RIGHT NOW OUR NURSING HOMES ARE HAVING A HARD TIME DEALING WITH THIS CRISIS. IT'S THE ABSOLUTE WRONG TIME TO CREATE MORE A BIGGER POTENTIAL POPULATION TO GOING TO NURSING HOMES. AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE ALSO REDUCING SENIOR NUTRITION SO NOW YOU HAVE- AN MS AS P. PROGRAM THIS REDUCING SERVICES AND WE'RE GONNA CUT SENIOR NUTRITION DOWN. AND SOME OF THAT- I BELIEVE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN IS RELATED TO MEALS ON WHEELS AND SO WE HAVE A WHOLE SENIOR POPULATION THAT HELPS DELIVER MEALS ON WHEELS. VOLUNTEERS MANIC THE FOOD. REMEMBER THIS OF FRAT POPULATION WHO OFTEN DOESN'T HAVE A SUPPORT MECHANISM AT HOME NOW THEY MIGHT END UP IN A IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. AND THEY WON'T HAVE MUCH IN THE WAY ADVOCACY- LESTER CAN HAVE LESSEN ADVOCACY BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA CUT THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM. THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE MOSTLY AS VOLUNTEERS TO HELP LOOK OUT FOR THIS FOR THESE PEOPLE. WE'RE SENDING THE WRONG MESSAGE TO OUR SENIOR POPULATION AND IT'S REALLY REALLY TROUBLING- SO I JUST I JUST SCRATCH MY HEAD ON ON THAT- I NOT LOOKING AT A MASTER PLAN IN AGING AND I THINK THAT'S STILL GOING FORWARD- THIS IS A GOOD START. I FRANKLY I HOPE THIS ISN'T REFLECT WITH THE WERE GOING IN THE FUTURE SO SORRY I'M A LITTLE WOUND UP HERE THIS MORNING BUT- BUT I WANT TO GET A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF THE IS WITHIN THE I TEND TO CUTS WITH ENOUGH THE HEALTH PART OF THE BUDGET- AND THEN I IT'S PROBABLY IT FEELS VERY MUCH LIKE WE'VE- TAKEN. THIS PLAN OFF THE SHELF FROM THE GREAT SESSION DUST IT OFF AND NOT LEARN FROM THE MISTAKES WE THE LAST TIME WE WE'RE GONNA REPEAT SOME OF THE SAME THAT WE DID THE LAST TIME OH. WOW I'VE THE UNDER MARY SAID THIS IS A- WHICH WERE FOCUSED ON MAINTAINING. THE SAME TIME WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE ACCESS SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MORE PEOPLE ELIGIBLE. BUT LESS SERVICES AND LESS PLACES FOR THEM TO GO AND THAT DOESN'T THAT FEELS WRONG ON ON MANY MANY LEVELS SO LET'S TALK ABOUT- SOME THE OPTIONAL SERVICES. ADULT DENTAL FOR EXAMPLE- THAT'S IT THAT'S THAT'S A TOUGH ONE- YOU KNOW NIGHT YOU I'M NOT. I'M NOT ONE WHO'S CONSTANTLY ADVOCATING ABOUT DENTISTRY- BUT THIS IS A HUGE MISTAKE WE MADE IN THE LAST RECESSION. AND IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT AGAIN- PEOPLE WHO HAVE THESE COMPLEX DENTAL PROBLEMS ARE GONNA END UP IN EMERGENCY ROOMS. AND THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHERE WE WANT THEM WHEN YOU COULD ACT WE SAW SOME OF THEIR PROBLEMS. AFFECT THE FACT THAT THERE CONSIDER OPTIONAL IS ALSO FRUSTRATING IT. SEE EVERITT COOP IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND FINALLY YOU KNOW MADE THE CORRELATION THE MATH IS A PART OF THE HUMAN BODY. BUT IT FEELS LIKE. RIGHT NOW THE MATH DOESN'T MATTER TOO MUCH. AND THEN ALSO WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO ELIMINATE PUT PUT THE AFFECTS SERVICES. SO I GUESS FEET DON'T MATTER ANYMORE EITHER AND WHEN USE AND THEN WE'RE GONNA ELIMINATE THE DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM WE HAVE. FOUR MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA TAKING INSULIN. AND THOSE DIABETIC BUT THE DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM HASN'T REALLY GOTTEN OFF THE GROUND YET 50% OF OUR OUR PUBLIC S- PRE DIABETIC WE'RE GOING TO SPEND MONEY ON TREATMENT WE'RE NOT GONNA SPEND MONEY ON PREVENTION. AND WE'RE GOING TO SPEND MONEY ON PREVENTION FROM A DENTAL PERSPECTIVE WE SEE A LOT OF DIABETICS HAVE DENTAL PROBLEMS. WE SEE A LOT OF DIABETICS WHO HAVE FOOT PROBLEMS. WOUND CARE IS A BIG PART OF WHAT A LOT OF DIE BET A LOT OF PRIDE. PODIATRIST DO FOR SOME OF THEIR PATIENTS. THREE ELIMINATE THAT- SO THAT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN IN ANOTHER SETTING BUT WE'RE BASICALLY SAYING THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA LET THIS PROVIDERS DO IT. AND THEN. FINALLY A NURSE ANESTHETISTS. GONNA LAMINATE THAT PART TO. NURSE ANESTHETIST PROVIDE A LOT OF ANESTHESIA IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. BUT WE'RE WE'RE NOT GONNA LET THEM BE CONSIDERED OPTIONAL BENEFIT IF YOUR EMPLOYED BY SOMEBODY THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY BUT WE'RE- IT JUST FEELS LIKE THE WHOLE SERIES WHY WERE MAINTAINING ELIGIBILITY ORGAN SAY WERE ELIGIBLE WE'RE REDUCING ACCESS ON THE OTHER SIDE AND WE'RE AND WE'RE DOING THAT- IN WAYS THAT IS REALLY. REALLY REALLY TRADING. AND I KNOW WE CAN HAVE A WHOLE DISCUSSION ABOUT PROP FIFTY SIX- YOU KNOW IT FEELS THAT- THAN THIS ADMINISTRATION CARRIES ON WHAT THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION DOES AND- AND REMEMBER. THE REASON PROP FIFTY SIX EVEN CAME TO BE. IS BECAUSE A GROUP OF PEOPLE SAID WE'RE FRUSTRATED AND SAID WE NEED THE MONEY FOR TO PROTECT OUR PROVIDER NETWORK. WE'RE JUST GETTING TO THE POINT WERE RE RE RE BUILDING THIS PROVIDER NETWORK TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO PEOPLE AND NOW WE'RE GONNA LITERALLY PULL THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER THAT. AND WE'RE GOING TO DECIMATE OUR PROVIDER NETWORK AND MAYBE. MAYBE THAT'S- HOW I DON'T KNOW I HOPE THAT'S NOT THE PLAN BUT THAT'S- THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE DO THAT SO. DO I AM CURE- AND I HOPE THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE THE LA- CAN. AS A DIVE INTO THIS- AS WE LOOK AT THE- AS AT THE NUMBERS A DISPARITY BETWEEN THE LA OWES PROJECTIONS AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROJECTIONS. ARE ARE ARE CAUSING A LOT OF CONFUSION AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN GET THE ANSWER THERE. SOME OF THE- QUESTIONS ABOUT. HOW MUCH OF THE POPULATION OF THE MEDICARE POPULATION IS GOING TO BE AT THE FIFTY PERCENT. REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE FEDS AND HOW MUCH IS GOING TO BE AT THE REALLY KNOW THAT. AND MAYBE THAT'S MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING THERE THAT THAT'S LEADING TO. THE DISPARITY BETWEEN THE TWO. BETWEEN THE TWO. A PROJECTIONS. SO I COULD GO ON I'M I'M SORRY I'M A LITTLE I'M A LITTLE BIT ON A ROLL BUT. BUT I JUST YOU KNOW I THINK- GEORGE SKELTON HAVE A COLUMN IN THE LA TIMES YESTERDAY AND SAID YOU KNOW. IF YOU'RE OLD. YOU'RE AGED NEAR DISABLED. THIS BUDGET REALLY HAMMERS HAMMERS YOU HARD AND THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT WE DO AND IN TIMES OF CRISIS WE HAMEL WE HAVE WE HAMMER THOSE WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD IT. WHO CAN LEAST PROTECT THEMSELVES. AND HAVE THE SMALL AND HAVE THE SMALLEST VOICES IN OUR SOCIETY AND I PREFER ONE THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY WRONG. AND I'M I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED. THANK YOU MR TRUMP. THANK YOU DOCTOR WHEN. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER. IN MY WORLD AND- THE WAY I WAS RAISED WE RESPECT OUR ELDERS. WE'RE HERE BECAUSE OF OUR ELDERS OUR ELDERS WERE. OUR BENEFACTOR ONE TIME AND SO WE PUT THEM ON A SHELF AS MISTER WHAT IS SAID. AND. BALANCE THE BUDGET ON THEIR BACKS ALSO. I HAVE AN EXPECTATION WHEN I BECOME. IN THAT POSITION THAT SOCIETY WILL HONOR WHAT I'VE DONE. AND RESPECT ME AND TAKE CARE OF ME WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN. SUSAN DOING HALF. THIS IS TAKING A POPULATION AND MINIMIZING THEM. THIS IS WRONG. WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO. COME TO A CONCLUSION JUST LIKE MR TING SAID YESTERDAY'S HEARING. ON THE- ANTICIPATED FELL WORKS. THE POSSIBILITY OF STAGNATING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IS REPREHENSIBLE. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT AND I KNOW WHAT'S MORE ART THAN SCIENCE WHEN YOU LOOK AT ASSUMPTIONS. BUT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. BE A BUSINESS LIKE BUT ALSO IN DURING TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE HOLD. IN OUR HEARTS. SO WHAT I WANT TO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ASSUMPTIONS. OUR OWN A EITHER. A LIMITED AMOUNT OF MONIES HELD THE SIDE. WERE AND CONTINUE TO FUND THESE POPULATIONS AS EXPECTED THE LEGISLATURE THE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. BUT THAT NAY CALPERS THING RELIEVED AFTER THAT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION REALLY BUGS ME. HAD A REALLY REALLY. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO IT LIKE A BUSINESS EVERY MONTH EVERYBODY HAS AN EXPECTATION BEING PAID IF THERE IS. AN OCCURRENCE THE PEOPLE ARE ON NOTICE TO BE ABLE TO. OF BATON DOWN THE HATCHES. BUT OTHER POSSIBILITIES STAGNATION OF DOLLARS TO ME IS HIS ABSOLUTELY THE WRONG THING TO DO AND YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE MISTER WOULD COMING FORWARD BUT- OUR WHOLE PURPOSE IN THE LEGISLATURE'S TO DO NO HARM. TO BE HELPFUL. BUT MY CULTURE MY NATIVE AMERICANS FOR HIS HIS RESPECT URAL RESPECT YOUR ELDERS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER MATHIS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE AND AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES MISTER FRAZIER MISTER BOYD- AS WE DO LOOK AT THIS BUDGET. YOU KNOW THE IDEA OF GETTING RID OF EVERYTHING WE FOUGHT FOR OVER THE LAST DECADE. TO PROVIDE PREVENTIVE CARE AND PREVENTIVE TREATMENT ALL THE LESSONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED. TO THROW THAT'LL WAY. I THINK ONLY LEADS US INTO A BIGGER PROBLEM. TO THROW AWAY LESSONS LEARNED. ESPECIALLY ON THE HEALTHCARE SIDE. IS ONLY GOING TO MAKE THINGS WORSE. WE KNOW THAT PREVENTIVE CARE AND TREATMENT WORK. WE KNOW THAT TAKING CARE OF OUR ELDERLY AS MISTER FRAZIER SAID. THESE ARE THE ONES THAT TOOK CARE OF US WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION. TO TAKE CARE OF THEM NOT ONLY THAT BUT AS LEGISLATORS. WHO OPERATE THE GOVERNMENT WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THAT THE PROMISES OUR GOVERNMENT HAS MADE TO ITS CITIZENS. OUR CAT. AND YOU KNOW I'M NOT SPEAKING OFF ANY WRITTEN NOTES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT- WE HAVE TO ENSURE THOSE PROMISES ARE KEPT. AND QUITE FRANKLY I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD TELL GOVERNOR HE CAN KICK ROCKS WITH HIS BUDGET AND CUTTING OUR HEALTH SIDE. BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING DURING A HEALTH PANDEMIC. YOU'RE GOING TO CUT HEALTH. THE MAKES ZERO SENSE. THERE ARE OTHER PLACES THAT CAN TAKE CUTS MUCH BETTER THAT AREN'T GOING TO PUT OUR PEOPLE EVEN MORE AT RISK. ARE ELDERLY OR PEOPLE WITH THIS. OUR CHILDREN TO CUT THESE PROGRAMS IT'S ONLY GONNA COST US MORE MONEY IN THE LONG RUN IN WE ALREADY KNOW THAT. SO COLLEAGUES AYE AYE ASH YOU TO. HELP REJECT THIS. AND LOOK FOR BETTER WAYS. FOR OUR STATE TO MOVE FORWARD I KNOW THIS IS KIND OF A SOAPBOX. BLOOD WE ALL KNOW BETTER AND- AS MIGHT TELL MY CHILDREN IF YOU KNOW BETTER DO BETTER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND- FOR THOSE ON THE WITNESS VIDEO ROOM WE WILL HAVE QUESTIONS THEY ARE COMING HAND SO WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER WRONGS. IT'S ONE TO ONE. CHIME IN ALSO- CERTAINLY WHEN THIS- THE COVE IN NINETEEN ERA IN THIS CRISIS STARTED WE HEARD THAT IT REALLY AFFECTED OUR ELDERS- THROUGHOUT ALL OUR COMMUNITIES INCLUDING THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION WHO ARE STILL STRUGGLING TO GET TEST ON COMMUNITIES AND TRAVEL RESERVATIONS TO THIS DAY. AND NOW TO SEE THAT THE BUDGET COMING FORWARD THE BIGGEST CUTS ARE TO OUR SENIOR POPULATION THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE THEIR PROGRAM THAT STARTED TO- TAKE A ONE EIGHT FROM THAT ARGUMENT THAT WE NEED TO BE PROTECTING OUR ELDERS IN THE- CALIFORNIA OUR SENIOR POPULATE. FOR MOST AFFECTED BY IT IN ALL IN ILLINOIS WE SEEN HOMES THAT HAVE BEEN HAVING SAY AREAS OF PEOPLE NOT ONLY JUST POSITIVE FOR COPA NINETY IN. ALSO I MEAN TO DEATH WITH IN TO SEE THAT WE'RE TAKE THE MONEY AWAY. THAT IS SOME THAT WE HAVE TO STRUGGLE WITH TODAY IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT. TAKING THAT MONEY AWAY IT'S ABOUT THE SAFETY AND THE HEALTH RIGHT WITH THE WITH THE DIFFERENT DENTAL THE MEDICAL ALL THOSE THINGS THAT ARE IN THERE. FOR OUR OUR OUR ELDERLY POPULATION AND ONE THING THAT WE CANNOT OVERLOOK IS THE FOOD SUBSIDIES THAT WE GIVE TO OUR TO OUR ELDERS I SEE HERE'S- THAT DEPEND ON THAT. TO SURVIVE EVERY DAY. THIS AIN'T THAT THE YEN IS ALARMING TO SEE NOT ONLY SEE THAT SOME MONEY AS THEY CAN- AWAY. BUT A LOT. OF IT. IT THAT EVERY TIME WE GET INTO BUDGET CONSTRAINTS. THERE'S ALWAYS A LOOK AT OUR ELDERS IN OTHER POPULATIONS AS THE FIRST PLACE TO HIT. AND I AM JOINING OUR COLLEAGUES TODAY AND THOSE ARE SPEAKING UP ON THIS ISSUE. THAT WE NEED TO SEND A STRONG MESSAGE BACK THAT. IF WE'RE GONNA CUT THE BUDGET THAT SENIOR POPULATION IS NOT THE TO GO TO START TO LOOK AT. IT ALSO- MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD THERE WAS A SPEAKER THAT SPOKE THAT TALKED ABOT FEDERAL FUNDS BEING IN IN JEOPARDY BASED ON CRITERIA CHANGING I WANTED TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ON THAT. AND IN PARTICULAR TIED TO PROGRAM A FLOW THROUGH FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE STATE IF WE START CHANGING SOME OF THOSE. REQUIREMENTS ARE EVEN FOR FEELING THOSE IS NOW THE STATE. ON THE HOOK FOR REPAYING THAT MONEYBACK WHICH IN THE END COST MORE MONEY TO THE STATE. RATHER THAN TAKING OUT OF THE BUDGET. MISTER NEWTON WITH THE LA- DO YOU MIND A DRESSING THAT QUESTION I BELIEVE IT'S ON PAGE TWO OF YOUR HAND UP. YES CERTAINLY- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- YES THE ISSUE- CONCERNS THAT FEDERAL GUIDANCE THAT HAS COME OUT FROM FROM THAT- THE FEDERAL MINISTRATION RELATED TO THE FAMILY FIRST TO. FRONT A RELIEF FOR A VIRUS RELIEF- FIND AND THE ENHANCED- FEDERAL FUNDING AND- THE GUIDANCE DOES SUGGEST THAT TO THAT CHANGES TO- SORT OF BENEFIT LEVELS AND ELIGIBILITY LEVELS. SORT OF PRIOR- WITHIN SORT OF THE TWENTY TWENTY YEAR COULD JEOPARDIZE THE FUNDING THE SCONCES JUST COME OUT AND THAT. SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE- I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION IS RECENTLY. AWARE OF AND- AND THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE BUDGET CONTROL SECTION- THAT SAID. THAT A CENT STATE THE- THAT THE- MATTER. QUESTIONS THAT WOULD DOT THE LAW OF JEOPARDIZED OF FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WOULD IT WOULD NOT THEN TAKE A FACTOR SO- BECAUSE- APPARENTLY IT LOOKS THAT THAT IF YOU JEOPARDIZE. THE FAT ONES. SMALL SAVINGS ACTION ON THE ON THE BENEFIT OR- SIDE PROJECT THE WHOLE PLOT OF FUNDING IN WE'RE TALKING THE BILLIONS DOLLARS SO- IT WOULD BE VERY VERY RISKY TO RESCUE- THE LOSS OF FEDERAL FUNDS SO. IT IS AN ISSUE IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE MINISTRATIONS EVALUATING WERE EVALUATING AND TURN IT WILL BE ADVISING THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE'RE NOT TO WE'RE NOT TO TAKING SORT OF RELATIVELY SMALL THE GENERAL FUND SAVINGS ACTIONS THAT THAT COULD PUT AT RISK- OF THE LARGE RECEIPT OF FEDERAL FUNDS. THAT THAT ESSENTIALLY IS THE ISSUE BUT BEING FACED. THANK THANK YOU FOR THEM IS CHENNAI'S TO POINT THAT OUT THAT THAT. FEDERAL FLOW THROUGH DOLLARS AND SOMETIMES WHEN WE START TO LOOK TO HAVE A SAVINGS COULD HAVE THE REVERSE IMPACT BY COSTING MORE TO THE STATE. THAT FOR FILLING THOSE OBLIGATIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALMOST ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I- JUST WANT TO. ACKNOWLEDGE AND COMMEND MY COLLEAGUES FOR SPEAKING OUT- AT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO THAT IS THAT- WE'VE BEEN. WORKING WITH THIS YEAR POPULATION FOR THE LAST. FEW YEARS AND EVEN NOW THAT WE HAVE THIS PANDEMIC BUT THE GENERAL SENTIMENT NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT THROUGHOUT THE- COUNTRY IS THAT. WE HAVE TO IF WE GET. WHEN WE GET OUT OF THIS. THAT WE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE SENIORS ARE SENIORS AT SHELTERED LONG. BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE VULNERABLE. BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE SHELTER THEM AND START WITH THEM GOING TO SHELTER THEM. AND NOT PROVIDE THE MEDICAL SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. YOU'RE RIGHT IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BECAUSE EVEN WHEN WE ARE MOVING TO GET OUT OF SHELTERING IN PLACE. THE GENERAL RECOMMENDATION IS FOR THE SENIOR POPULATION ESPECIALLY THOSE ONE GOALS ARE COMPROMISED STATE. WELL NOW WE'RE TELLING THEM STAY HOME BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO PROVIDE ANY SERVICES. ON THIS COMPLAINT- I- WE'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE WE WORK ON A PILOT PROGRAM THREE YEARS A GOAL IN MY AREA IT'S- ANGEL FOOD PROJECT. WHERE ARE. THE KEY. J. I. HE DIDN'T TO FOLKS COME OUT OF THE HOSPITAL I THEY HAD CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE I'M EXCITED FOR THE RESULTS ARE BE FOR OUR PROGRAM- THERE THE HOSPITALIZATION RATE WAS ONE IN THREE PEOPLE WOULD RETURN TO THE HOSPITAL WITHIN THIRTY DAYS THE DATE OF THEIR COLLECTIVE RIGHT NOW SUGGEST THAT ONE IN TWENTY PEOPLE ARE GOING ON BACK TO THE HOSPITAL AND THIRTY DAYS BECAUSE WE'RE PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOOD AND YOU KNOW JUST KIND OF TO PUT IT INTO PERSPECTIVE PERSPECTIVE I UNDERSTAND THAT. AND DAY OF HOSPITALIZATION COST ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SO IF WE'RE FEEDING PEOPLE. AND KEEPING THEM OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. WE'RE SAVING MONEY NOT ONLY SAVING LIVES BUT SAVING MONEY AS WELL AND SO CUTTING THESE PROGRAMS AND CUTTING THESE YOU KNOW THE FUNDING IS ONLY GOING TO- WE'RE SHOOTING OURSELVES IN THE FOOT. BECAUSE NOW WE'RE SENDING THEM BACK TO THE HOSPITAL AND IT'S GOING TO COST US TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY IF WE ONLY INVESTED YOU KNOW A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS AND FEEDING THEM AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE HEALTHY. SO THAT'S THE POINT I WANTED TO MAKE BUT WE ARE CORRECT WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT HOW WE LOVE OUR SENIORS WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. WELL DONE WORK WITH OUR SENIOR LEGISLATORS I'VE WITH A A. R. P. ALL OF YOU HAVE YOU ALL WE HAVE ALL BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS AND THEY'RE SO PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY SEE POSITIVE IMPACTS AND THEIR WELL BEING BUT NOW WE'RE- SORRY TO THAT. BUT IT IS NOT FROM MY AND TO MISTER FRAZIER DOES WALL MISTER MATHESON POINT WHATEVER POOR. WEEK WE ARE. TALK ABOUT DOING THE RIGHT THING AND THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT THING AND BE. PANDEMIC IS A HELD PANDEMIC RIGHT BUT WE'RE COMING HEALTHCARE BAD AGAIN I WON'T BELABOR THE POINT AND MORE BY WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS AND DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND NOT CUT THESE PROGRAMS THAT ARE ONLY GOING TO GET US BACK IN THE HOLE THAT WE WERE IN THE BEGINNING. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT THESE PROGRAMS TO PROTECT OUR POPULATION IF WE WANTED TO LOOK AT IT AS A BUDGET ISSUE IT'S GOING TO COST US MORE MONEY IF WE WANT TO LOOK AT IT AS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IS A HUMAN. RIGHTS ISSUE WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR SENIOR POPULATION I AGREE WITH MR FRAZIER I WANT SOMEBODY TO TAKE CARE OF ME I WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THEM NOW AND SHOW OUR OUR YOUNG FOLKS THAT IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. SO THAT WHEN I AM THERE THEY FEEL THE SAME- COMMITMENT TO TAKING CARE OF ME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO AND. I'M GONNA BE A LITTLE DIRECT I THINK I HAVE A TOTAL OF FOUR QUESTIONS AND SO IF I CAN I'M GONNA START WITH THE LA- MISTER NEWTON I REALLY WANT TO DO AGAIN IF I CAN ON TO PAGE FOUR- IT IT SEEMS UNDER ADDED MAJOR COSTS THAT THERE'S ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THAT. IS ON THIS SPREADSHEET THAT I THINK NEEDS A LITTLE MORE EXPLAINING AND SO I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN DIG INTO THAT- WITH SOME DETAILS- YOU HAD REFERENCED IN YOUR COMMENTS THAT THIS WAS FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS OF BACK CLAIMS AND I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN EXTRAPOLATE A LITTLE BIT. BUT CERTAIN MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS YES THIS REFERS TO THE THREE PAYMENTS HAVE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR IMPROPER CLAIMING. AND PROPS THE TO THE ADMINISTRATION OR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAN. PROPS GIVES MORE SORT OF TECHNICAL SORT OF DETAILS SORT OF ON THIS BUT TO WE UNDERSTAND THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS JUST DISCOVERED- EARLIER THIS YEAR- I THINK ADMINISTRATION IS CALLING THIS SOMEONE OF A SYSTEMS FAILURE IN TERMS OF HOW THINGS WORK. PROPS CODED INTO THE SYSTEM IN TERMS OF THE CLAIMING THIS ISN'T THIS IS DOES NOT AFFECT EVERYTHING IN IN MEDIC HOW IT'S JUST CERTAIN SYSTEMS WITHIN. THE MEDICAL DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR SO- THE ISSUE IS- AT LARGELY AND CLAIMANTS- CLAIMING FOR BETTER FISHERIES CERTAIN- WHO DID NOT HAVE. THROUGH THE SATISFACTORY IMMIGRATION STATUS TO RECEIVE SORT OF THE FEDERAL MEDICARE AL OR THE MEDICAID FUNDING- SO- APPARENTLY THIS AFFECTED TO SEVERAL YEARS OF CLAIMING- THE- THE STATE HAS APPARENTLY ABLE TO A YEAR TO- MAKE- MAKE AMENDS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION CAN CAN. BE TO TERMS OF THE PROCESS OF IN RING IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT FROM. A THE STATE'S DISCOVERY OF THIS THANK. THERE ARE SUPPOSED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DISCUSS AT TEN AND I FOR THAT THE MINORS SO. THE LARGE AMOUNT IN THE IN THE BY REFLECTS THE PASSED THE RETROACTIVE- SORT OF FEDERAL REPAYMENT BUT IT'S AN ISSUE GOING FORWARD IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THE ERROR DOESN'T DOESN'T CONTINUE AND THAT THE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED TO ENSURE THAT THE CLAIM IN IS. IS FULLY PROPER GOING FORWARD SO THE BUDGET THE MULTI YEAR BUDGET I BELIEVE HAS BEEN BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THAT- TO INSURE THAT THAT THE CLAIM IS PROPER OR SO. THAT IS SORT OF THE PARAMETERS THAT THAT WE'RE WE'RE AWARE OF PROBABLY THE STRETCHING BE PROPS MUCH MORE DETAILED IN TERMS OF HOW THIS WAS WAS DISCOVERED- BUT THOSE ARE THE BROAD PARAMETERS OF THE- OF THE ISSUE. THANK YOU MISTER NOON MISTER DORSEY DO YOU- ONE AWAY AND PLEASE. MR. HI THIS IS JACKIE COOPER- MISTER DORSEY HAS ASKED THAT I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES MY NAME IS JC COOPER THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND ADDS WAS PRESENTED THE DEPARTMENT DID IDENTIFY- A CLEANING ISSUE WITHIN OUR SYSTEM FOR STATE ONLY PROGRAMS WHERE WE WERE INAPPROPRIATELY- DRAWING DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR SERVICES NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE SERVICES- IT DOES VERY ACROSS VARIOUS AREAS DENTAL DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SOME PHARMACY REBATES AND THEN WITHIN OUR MANAGED CARE PROGRAM- THIS WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO IDENTIFY AND NOTIFY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THIS. FINDING WE WILL HAVE HISTORICAL PAY BACK IN VARIOUS PROGRAMS FOR UP TO THE SEVEN YEARS IDENTIFIED- AND THEN WE WILL HAVE FUTURE FORWARD OF ADJUSTMENTS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE APPROPRIATELY CLAIMING FEDERAL FUNDS FOR SERVICES THAT DO NOT MEET THE EMERGENCY SERVICE CRITERIA AVAILABLE FOR STATE ONLY PROGRAMS. AND I I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP OFF LINE IF I CAN FOR- FURTHER DETAIL BUT- DID JUST WANT TO HEAR THAT INITIAL EXPLANATION IF I CAN I'D I DO WANT TO TURN TO. DURING PLEASE IN THE WITNESS VIDEO ROOM. AND THAT AND I'M. I'M REALLY STRUGGLING A BIT BECAUSE THIS PANDEMIC EVENTS TAUGHT AT US ANYTHING IS THE VALUE OF REALLY HAVING A STRONG. PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE AN INFRASTRUCTURE. IN FACT MUCH OF OUR ECONOMIC CRASH IN THE RESULTING DEVASTATING CUTS THAT WE NOW FACE CAN BE DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE WOEFULLY UNDERFUNDED PUBLIC HEALTH THOUGH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE FACING A POTENTIAL LOSS OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. REALIGNMENT FUNDING WHICH WILL NOT BE BACK FILLED BY FEDERAL. AID AND SPECIFICALLY. FOR COVERT COSTS ON A TEMPORARY BASIS SO. I GUESS I'M TRYING TO. UNDERSTAND OF FORGETTING LAST FUNDING ARE WE INVESTING THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO GET US READY FOR THE NEXT PANDEMIC. IT'S AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT YOU ASK AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT- WHILE WE DO- PLAN AHEAD FOR PANDEMICS I THINK WHAT THIS PANDEMIC HAS DEMONSTRATED TO US IS THAT. PREPARING AND PREPARING FOR A PANDEMIC REQUIRES MUCH MORE THAN SIMPLY THINKING ABOUT YOUR INFECTIOUS DISEASE FREE MARKET ALSO. TO THE POINT HERE- MEANS THAT WE MUST ALSO BE PREPARED FOR. SONIC DISEASES FOR MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS AND FOR ALL OF THE OTHER AREAS THAT THAT ANY KIND OF RESPONSE WOULD REQUIRE PARTICULARLY WHEN IT REQUIRES AN ALL OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSE. SO WHAT I WOULD NOTE HERE IS THAT INDEED WE MUST CONTINUE TO FUND OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE BUT LET'S ALSO NOTE THAT THIS IS ALL OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSE AND SO THAT ACROSS ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. THE FRAMING THAT WE HAVE INVESTMENTS THAT WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CAN GET CARE. UP RECEIVE SOCIAL SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. OVER TIME ARE ALSO PART OF THE INVESTMENTS IN MAKING SURE THAT WE WILL BE A STRONG STATE IN THE FACE OF ANY FURTHER FIFTY INFECTIOUS DISEASES THESE ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TIMES IN THE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE. ARE BY NO MEANS BEING MADE LIGHTLY- BUT WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT IN THESE TIMES OF ECONOMIC CHALLENGES ALL OF US TOGETHER LET'S THINK ABOUT HOW ARE DEPARTMENTS IN A RESOURCES- TOGETHER- CREATE A RESPONSE FOR THE CURRENT. ENVIRONMENT AND FUTURE ENVIRONMENT THAT CAN CAN GREAT RESILIENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. I AM DR RANDALL I HOPE WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IS. A REAL WILLINGNESS FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO WANT TO SUPPORT TO YOUR DEPARTMENT THAT- WE REALLY LOOK TOWARDS YOU WHEN THE GUIDANCE THAT YOU'VE HELPED TO PROVIDE AND- AND TO BELIEVE IN YOU. AND SO WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO. DO THE HARD JOB THAT YOU HAVE SO. PLEASE LET US KNOW HOW WE CAN BEST BE HELPFUL I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'M REALLY TRYING TO CONVEY WITH MY QUESTION- TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE TOOLS NECESSARY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT. MY NEXT QUESTION THOUGH IS TOWARDS TOBY EWING AND YOU HAD BROUGHT UP MENTAL HEALTH AND- I'M GONNA. MAKE A METAPHOR AND APOLOGIES FOR IT IN ADVANCE BUT IF. KOBE NINETEEN IS AN EARTHQUAKE THEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SO THIS THE NOMINEE THAT ARE COMING FROM THAT. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO BE REALLY COGNIZANT OF THAT. AND SO GIVEN THAT WE KNOW THAT THIS IS COMING THIS TERRIFYING REALITY AND THE UNPRECEDENTED LIMITS ON OUR STATE'S ABILITY TO HELP. GIVE US TO HELP US COUNTIES IN ENSURING THAT THEY CONTINUE TO PROVIDE GOOD ACCESS TO SERVICES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY TO JOIN YOU- I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT THE STATE SHOULD THINK ABOUT. FIRST IS AS YOU SAID THAT COUNTIES ARE FACING ENORMOUS. ENORMOUS CHALLENGES RELATED TO BOTH FISCAL ISSUES. OPERATING REALITIES AND THEN GROWING MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. RECOGNIZING THAT NEW FINANCING IS REALLY NOT AN OPTION AND THAT WE ARE IN A PERIOD OF CUTS. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE FISCAL INCENTIVES THAT THE STATE IS CREATED FOR COUNTIES. RIGHT NOW ALL THEIR FISCAL INCENTIVES ARE FOCUSED ON SPENDING DOLLARS QUICKLY AND WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT STEPPING BACK FROM THAT A BIT. IN CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE CAN SLOW DOWN SPENDING. RELATED TO THAT ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE GREATER FLEXIBILITY. IN TERMS OF MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT THE COMMISSION IMPLANTS ARE LOCAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WE'RE WORKING WITH COUNTIES TO FIND PLANS THAT WERE DEVELOPED IN SOME CASES TWO YEARS AGO IN SOME CASES SIX MONTHS AGO. FOR EXAMPLE THE MEDICAL STUDENT SERVICES ACT NONE OF THOSE PLANS WERE DEVELOPED HE AND THE CURRENT CODE ENVIRONMENT. WHETHER THAT'S AROUND HOW WE OPERATE. OR THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN. ANY OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT THE ABILITY OF STATE AGENCIES TO GRANT SOME FLEXIBILITY TO COUNTIES TO RETHINK PRIORITIES RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE TO DO MORE WITH LESS WOULD BE IMPORTANT. I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT THE INNOVATION COMPONENT OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT GIVES US SOME OPPORTUNITIES. DURING THIS ENVIRONMENT- SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDERS ARE ASKING FOR SET ASIDE OF INNOVATION AND THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. AND ALTHOUGH THE COMMISSION IS NOT ENGAGED ON THIS EXPLICITLY. IT THE EDUCATION COMPONENT IS REALLY DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THE ABILITY OF COUNTIES TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES NOW MORE THAN EVER THAT'S IMPORTANT. WE REALLY HAVE TO STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT HOW WE DO THINGS HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO LOWER COSTS IMPROVE OUTCOMES. AND FOCUS MORE ON OUTCOMES. I WANT TO MENTION. PROBABLY THE MOST CONCERNING ISSUE FOR THE COMMISSION AT THE MOMENT. AROUND SUICIDE PREVENTION. I WANT TO THANK THIS SUBCOMMITTEE FOR ITS LEADERSHIP OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. TO REALLY BRING THAT. BRING GREATER ATTENTION ON SUICIDE PREVENTION AND THIS OTHER NUMBER RAMOS FOR HIS LEGISLATION- THAT WAS UP YESTERDAY THANKS- CHAIR WOULD OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE. UP FOR HIS COMMENTS ON THAT BILL. THE COMMISSION IS VERY CONCERNED THAT SUICIDE PREVENTION. NEEDS ARE MORE EVER BEEN BEFORE. ALTHOUGH I'M WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING ALL OF THE RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THESE KINDS OF CRISES REALLY DRIVE INCREASES. AND SO SUBTLE RISK AND BEHAVIOR AND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WAYS THAT THE STATE CAN SUPPORTER OF LOCAL PARTNERS IN SUICIDE PREVENTION IN THE COUNTIES IN OUR SCHOOLS. IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND- I'D LOVE TO TALK ABOUT OTHER WAYS THAT THE STATE CAN SUPPORTERS HAVE PREVENTION I WOULD SAY THOSE THOSE BIG ISSUES RETHINKING INCENTIVES. ADDING SOME FLEXIBLE WHERE WE CAN. FORTIFYING INNOVATION AND REALLY DOUBLING DOWN ON PREVENTION OPPORTUNITIES IN GENERAL THE SUICIDE PREVENTION SPECIFICALLY. THANK YOU MISTER YOU IN MY NEXT QUESTION IS FOR MICHELLE BOSS AND- I TO. PIGGY BACK AN ECHO OFF OF WHAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM MANY PEOPLE HERE ON THE PANEL. BUT THE MAY REVISE INCLUDES A VAST NUMBER OF REDUCTIONS TO NEARLY EVERY COMMUNITY BASED LONG TERM SERVICE AND SUPPORT FOR OUR SENIORS. INCLUDING SEA BASS M. S. S. P. I. HSS CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTERS MEDI CAL OPTIONAL BENEFITS THAT ARE SO CRITICAL FOR OUR SENIORS AS WELL AS NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION. ALL OF THESE HELP OUR SENIORS TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY AND TO STAY OUT OF NURSING HOMES. WE ALL KNOW THAT NURSING HOMES ARE MORE EXPENSIVE NOT TO MENTION PROVIDE A LOWER QUALITY OF LIFE IN GENERAL FOR OUR FRAIL SENIORS. THIS WOULD BE TRUE AT ANY TIME AND- IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN THIS PANDEMIC THAT PRIMARILY AFFECTS SENIORS CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN YOUR THINKING. AND HOW THE ADMINISTRATION JUSTIFIES GOING SO FAR IN THIS DIRECTION. WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPACT MANY OF THESE PROPOSALS HAVE ON OUR OLDER CALIFORNIANS. AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS ON THINKING THROUGH OPPORTUNITIES TO IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE CARE MODELS AND WAYS TO KIND OF DECOMPRESS ARE CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES. WE YOU KNOW WE THINK ABOUT BECAUSE IT IS A WAY TO ACCELERATE OUR CREATIVE THINKING ON ALL OTHER WAYS TO DO BUSINESS AND TO ADDRESS THESE AT THE NEEDS OF OUR OUR OUR SENIOR CENTER AND I HAVE AN OLDER CALIFORNIANS. WE STAND COMMITTED THESE ARE PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME AND WE STAND COMMITTED TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS ON ALTERNATIVE AND IDEAS. WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE MY QUESTIONS BUT I'LL MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT ALMOST AS IF I WAS THE FIRST PERSON MAKING UP PUBLIC COMMENT KIND OF HOW I WANTED TO FRAME AT. AND I DID WANT TO TALK ABOUT THREE PROGRAMS THREE SPECIFIC LINE ITEMS THAT- STUCK OUT TO ME AND- THE FIRST IS WHEN I SPOKE WITH DOCTOR ANGEL I JUST THINK WE AS THE LEGISLATURE NEED TO LEAN INTO OUR- DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP THEM WITH WORKFORCE IN INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH THIS CRISIS. AND ALLOW US TO BE BETTER PREPARED FOR THE NEXT PANDEMIC. BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SONG BROWN IF I COULD JUST BECAUSE- IT'S DIFFICULT WHEN YOU'VE MADE COMMITMENTS TO INSTITUTIONS THAT MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THOSE COMMITMENTS. AND SONG BROWN IS A PROGRAM THAT WE PROMISED IN PERPETUITY AND ALLOWED HOSPITALS TO MAKE CHOICES REGARDING RESIDENTS. NOW I WOULD COUNTER AND SAY THAT I DO THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THE PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE INCREASING SLOTS AND UNDERSERVED AREAS. I WOULD ENCOURAGE THIS ADMINISTRATION TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONTINUE THAT SOURCE OF FUNDING AS I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO NEED LESS DOCTORS AFTER THIS PANDEMIC THAN BEFORE US GOING INTO IT. NOW THE FINAL ONE IF I CAN AND WOULD ASK THIS COMMITTEE JUST TO INDULGE ME I'VE- NEVER TALKED BOUT THEM IN PUBLIC AND JUST WANT TO TELL A LITTLE BIT OF A STORY BECAUSE I THINK SOMETIMES IT. PERSONALIZES AND REMINDS US THAT THEY'RE NOT JUST NUMBERS. HOUSE OF THREE NINE ZACHARIAS WERE MY GRANDPARENTS WHO CAME TO THIS COUNTRY WITHOUT DOCUMENTS SPENT THEIR WHOLE LIVES WORKING IN THE FIELD. AND THEY WOULD NEVER IMAGINE THAT THEIR SON AND GRANDSON WOULD END UP BEING ON THE LEGISLATURE AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO STAND UP AN ADVOCATE FOR SOMETHING THAT MATTERS TO THE- BUT I GOT ACTIVATED TO FIGHT FOR HEALTH FOR A WHOLE. BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON. AND I ESPECIALLY FIGHT FOR THE SENIORS BECAUSE I REMEMBER MY GRANDPARENTS AND THE SACRIFICE THAT THEY MADE FOR US. AND WOULD ASK THIS GOVERNOR TO TAKE A SECOND LOOK AND ANOTHER LOOK AND ANOTHER LOOK. TO TRY TO MEET HIS COMMITMENT AT THE START OF THE SENIORS BECAUSE THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC I THINK WE SHOULD STAND UP FOR ALL OF OUR SENIORS. WITH THAT JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT I'M HONORED. THAT THEY MADE THE DECISION TO COME TO THIS GREAT COUNTRY IN THE STATE. BECAUSE IT HERE THAT WE SETTLED WE SETTLED IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE SET ROOTS HERE WE DECIDED TO MAKE THIS PLACE BETTER THIS STATE THAT ARE. MY DAD GRADUATED FROM PERSON PRETTY GOOD SCHOOLS ON THE FIRST LATINO MEDICAL DOCTOR I WOULD SAY IT'S A GOOD INVESTMENT THAT THE STATE MADE. I WOULD ASK THAT THEY CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS INTO OUR SENIORS INTO OUR CALIFORNIANS INTO PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE OUR STATE BETTER. WITH THAT I WILL CO CLOSE HER QUESTIONS AND MOVE US ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT BUT WANTED TO ADD MY TWO CENTS IN TO TELL YOU WHY I COME TO THIS FIGHT AND WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS THIS YEAR WILL BE A CHOICE FOR ALL OF US. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M COMING BACK TO THIS FIGHT AND I WILL KEEP UP THIS FIGHT UNTIL WE'RE ABLE TO ACHIEVE HEALTH FOR ALL BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TELL PEOPLE WHERE YOU STAND AND WHAT YOU STAND FOR. WITH THAT I WILL PASS IT ON TO DOCTOR WOULD. HAVE APOLOGIZED ACTUALLY I MADE A LOT OF COMMENTS BUT IT DIDN'T ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS THAT I MEANT TO SO- THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDULGENCE- INDULGENCE MISTER CHAIR. COUPLE OF QUESTIONS SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT COME TO MIND- IT APPEARS IN THIS BUDGET THAT POLICY DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE LAST YEAR BILLS THAT WERE PASSED. WITH PROGRAMS THAT WERE TO BE IMPLEMENTED GOING FORWARD. THEY'RE NOT BEING PAUSE THERE BEING ELIMINATED. AND THAT TROUBLES ME WE COULD HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON ON SOME OF THESE THINGS WE ARE WHAT WE AGREED AS A LEGISLATURE TO IMPLEMENT THEM THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THEM INTO LAW. AND NOW THEY'RE BEING ELIMINATED WHY ARE WE NOT HITTING THE PAUSE BUTTON ON THESE PROGRAMS UNTIL THERE IS ADDITIONAL FUNDING AVAILABLE RATHER THAN ELIMINATING THESE PROGRAM SO I LEFT IS OR SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION I THINK OF FOR ALL GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES- THE- ELIGIBILITY FOR- LOW INCOME SENIORS BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY. THREE YEARS NOT MEANT THAT A 138% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S THESE ARE THESE ARE SENIOR CENTER REALLY HURTING. THAT IT THAT'S ELIMINATED- THE THING WE CALL FLIPPERS THE PEOPLE THAT SHE TURNED SIXTY FIVE AND THEY'RE ON MEDICARE THERE THERE MEDI CAL. AND THEY'RE SUDDENLY THEIR INCOME IS TOO HIGH AND THEY FLIP OFF AND THEN THEY HAVE TO SPEND DOWN AND RE APPLY AND GO THROUGH THE CYCLE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN- THAT. WAS MEANT TO HELP WITH ELIGIBILITY AND MAINTAIN- EFFICIENCIES AND THAT. IS BEING. ELIMINATED SO. I DON'T UNDERSTAND DâN WHY WERE USING THE BUDGET TO ELIMINATE POLICY RATHER THAN JUST BECAUSE IT UNTIL WE ACTUALLY HAVE. A REALIZATION OR YOU KNOW OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING SO COULD SOMEONE EXPLAIN WHY YOU'RE ELIMINATING. THE WORK THAT WE DID IN THE LEGISLATURE RATHER THAN UP HITTING THE PAUSE BUTTON. EDITOR. TOTALLY KNOWLEDGE THE THIS SENTIMENT- AND YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THAT WE- DISAGREE WITH WITH THE SENTIMENT AND A LOT OF WAYS. I THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET YOU KNOW DIDN'T PROPOSED A PULL BACK A LOT OF THESE THINGS IN JANUARY- WE- DIDN'T WANT TO PULL BACK OUR OWN PROPOSALS FROM FROM JANUARY AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED A LOT OF THESE BILLS WITH THE- INTENTION OF IMPLEMENTING THEM OR DEPARTMENTS OF WORKED. TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING THOSE THINGS AND THE WE HAVE A STRUCTURAL BUDGET PROBLEM THAT'S BEEN CREATED BY THIS BUDGET WE ARE RELYING ON FEDERAL DOLLARS TO HOPEFULLY- SAVE AND IT KIND OF. STAVE OFF SOME OF THESE REDUCTIONS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. BUT EVEN. THE FEDERAL MONEY THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR DOES NOT ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL ISSUE THAT'S BEEN CREATED BY- THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE FACING. SO WITH THE CERTAINLY THE BUDGET PROCESS IS A PLACE FOR US TO WORK THESE ISSUES OUT AND TO GO SHEET THESE THINGS- AND YOU KNOW WE WANT TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU ALL BUT- CERTAINLY THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE AND IS. EXTREMELY DIFFICULT ONE AND WE EXPECT THAT IT WILL BE FOR SEVERAL YEARS TO COME. I APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THAT BUT I THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION I ASKED IS WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST HIT PAUSE. ON SOME OF THESE ON POLICY THAT THAT WE HAVE ALL AGREED UPON RATHER THAN JUST FLAT OUT ELIMINATING THINGS WE GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE OKAY- THE MEDI CAL STATE RECOVERY SOMETHING WE'VE YOU KNOW SOMETHING THIS LEGISLATURE TRIED TO CHANGE FOR YEARS AND- THAT'S BEEN THAT'S BEEN ELIMINATED SO- THE GENERAL FUND SAVINGS ABOUT SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. NOW IT THE FEDERAL MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATE THIS BASICALLY MEANS THAT THAT IF YOU ARE A FAMILY MEMBER- THAT THAT SOMEONE MIGHT NOT APPLY FOR MEDI CAL BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF LOSING. THEIR HOME. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE GO BACK AND- IF SOMEONE HAS A HOME THAT WE CAN GO BACK AND TAKE ME TAKE THAT TAKE MONEY FROM THAT FROM THAT PROPERTY REPAY THEIR MEDI CAL BENEFITS OVER THE YEARS. NOW SOME OF THAT FIT YOU KNOW SOME OF THAT DEPENDING ON WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. REIMBURSEMENT LEVEL IS OF SOME OF ITS 50% SO WE DO THAT RECOVER THAT HALF OF THAT GOES BACK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SOME IS NINETY PERCENT. SO IS IN ESSENCE WERE BECOMING A COLLECTION AGENCY FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE. AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IS POTENTIALLY- PUTTING MORE PEOPLE INTO A HOMELESS SITUATION SO I YOU KNOW I STRUGGLE WITH SOME OF THESE. BUT I GO BACK TO THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION WHY IS THIS BUDGET. I'M DOING POLICY DECISIONS RATHER THAN HITTING THE PAUSE BUTTON UNTIL WE ACTUALLY HAVE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT AND NOT THAT'S- ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW PREVENTION. FOR DIABETES. WORK WERE KILLING A PROGRAM THAT JUST HASN'T EVEN REALLY GOTTEN STARTED YET YEAH WE'RE GONNA SPEND MILLIONS MAYBE EVEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THE TREATMENT OF DIABETES BUT WE WON'T PREVENT. WE WON'T WORK ON A PROGRAM TO PREVENT IT. DO YOU. THAT THIS IS BEYOND PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH- I DON'T I TYPE I JUST FUNDAMENTALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND. THE SOME OF THESE DECISIONS THAT THAT ARE LEARNED WITH LEADING TO SMALL LINE ITEMS TO HELP BALANCE OUR BUDGET. ARE GONNA HAVE HORRIBLE RAMIFICATIONS AND POTENTIALLY COSTS A LOT MORE MONEY IN THE FUTURE. DOES ANYBODY MAKE IT WHO WHO HOW DO THESE DECISIONS GET MADE. IN OURS IS- THERE'S A POT OF MONEY WILL TAKE THAT WILL TAKE THAT. TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE POTENTIAL RAMIFICATIONS AND THAT'S WHY I SAID EARLY ON IT FEELS LIKE WE TOOK THE OLD BUDGET PLANT THE OLD RECESSION PLAN OFF THE SHELF DUSTED OFF. AND IGNORED ALL THE THINGS THAT WE LEARNED- FROM THAT FROM BAD DECISIONS AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO. DO IT AGAIN. AND SO. SO FUNDAMENTALLY WHY ARE WE TAKING. ANSWERED YOU CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION OR IS IT JUST JUST THE DIRECTOR TING WE'RE JUST GONNA UNDUE POLICY THAT THE LEGISLATURE PUT IN PLACE INSTEAD OF PUTTING ON HOLD. I THINK THAT WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR SUGGESTIONS FROM THE LEGISLATURE ON ON ON OTHER IDEAS FOR HELPING NEIGHBORHOODS EIGHT EIGHT WHILE. OF THE JAZZ BUT NOW I THINK WHAT DOCTOR WHAT IS SAYING IS APPROPRIATE AND IF I CAN STEP IN HERE- MISTER DORSEY AS WELL AS THE- AUTHOR OF THE PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO WHICH HE'S REFERENCING. I TOO AM MOVED TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE ARE OPTIONS THAT WE CAN CONSIDER SIMPLY FOR PAUSING RATHER THAN ELIMINATE. BECAUSE THAT WILL ALLOW US IF BUDGET TIMES CHANGE TO. CONSIDER OUR OPTIONS BUT SIMPLY TO ONE WIND WHAT WAS A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK FOR US IN THE LEGISLATURE TO- GAIN THE SUPPORT TEND MOMENTUM- WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE WOULD WANTS TO ENGAGE THIS ADMINISTRATION WITH. BACK TO YOU DOCTOR WHAT IF YOU HAD ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU SUMMED IT UP AND YOU'RE GONNA. HAVE BROUGHT MY- BLOOD PRESSURE DOWN THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER ON THIS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR ALLOWING US TO CONTINUE TO ASK QUESTIONS ON THESE TOPICS FROM TOBY EWING PRODUCT THE AREA OF SUICIDE SOME CERTAINLY AND THE BILL THAT MANY OF US SOME ALL AROUND THIS DIRE SOME ARE CO AUTHORS ON A THANK YOU FOR THAT BUT IT BRINGS UP THE- SUICIDE RATES THAT ARE RISING- NOT ONLY NOW AND COVERT NINETEEN. ERA BUT HAVE BEEN ON ON. SOME YEARS BACK- FOR MENTAL HEALTH OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION TO DRAFT A STATEWIDE SUICIDE PREVENTION STRATEGIC PLAN AND WITHIN THAT PLAN I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW THAT IF SOME OF THAT WORK STARTS TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THE AREAS THAT WE'RE IN NOW BECAUSE WE HAD A- YOU KNOW COMMENTS ON THE POPULATION OF OUR ELDERS AND IN THE STATE BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT ARE YOU ARE IMPACTED SEVERELY BY THIS BUDGET THAT ARE THAT IS HERE. AND WE HAD TESTIMONY- YESTERDAY AND HOW OF YOUNG PEOPLE A YOUNG PERSON WHO- NEED AT THESE RESOURCES THAT WERE THERE SO I THINK FOR TOBY IF HE COULD COME BACK UP AND SEE IF THERE IS SOME. AREAS THAT MAYBE WE COULD HEAR ABOUT THE MAYBE WE CAN START TO ADVOCATE FOR- AROUND THE SITUATION THAT'S HERE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUES TO BE. A NUMBER OF ONE COMPONENT I BELIEVE WE CANNOT TALK ABOUT RESTARTING AN ECONOMY UNLESS WE START TO TALK ABOUT THE BALANCE OF MENTAL HEALTH ALONG WITH IT. THOSE THAT ARE GOING THROUGH ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS THOSE THAT ARE LIVING ALONE THAT ARE ISOLATED THOSE ARE ELDERLY THAT. THAT FEEL THE NEED RESOURCES TO CONTINUE TO COPE. THERE'S A COMPONENTS TO MOVING THE ECONOMY FORWARD AND WITHIN THE BUDGET TAKING OUT CERTAIN THINGS THAT TAKES AWAY THAT BALANCE. STARTS TO REALLY QUESTION HOW SUCCESSFUL WE WILL BE MOVING FORWARD IF ALL OF OUR EFFORTS ARE ON JUST ONE ELIMINATING STUFF FROM THE BUDGET. AND MOVE FORWARD WITH THE ECONOMY OPENING UP AND NOT TAKING INTO PERSPECTIVE. MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT THAT MANY PEOPLE YOU'D NEED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SORT OF TOBY COULD ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT PLAN. THANK YOU THE SENATE RAMA SPEECH AT THE OPPORTUNITY AGAIN- YET THAT THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN DOING A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE ACTUALLY VERY SIGNIFICANT. FOR THE CURRENT MOMENT IN TIME WE ARE PARTNERING YEAH OUT OF I'LL TALK ABOUT SAYS HAVE PREVENTION BUT I WANT TO MENTION A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME IDEAS. WE'VE BEEN PARTNERING WITH DH CS WITH COUNTIES WITH THE PART IN STATE HOSPITALS WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE TODAY. WHERE THEY'RE WORKING WHERE THEY'RE NOT. INTO SUPPORTER COUNTY AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO REALLY RETHINK SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS AND TO REDESIGN THEM TO THAT WE CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE. IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE USING LIMITED PUBLIC RESOURCE THAT'S- THE BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY IS AROUND FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS FOR EXAMPLE. WERE WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF COUNTIES TO REALLY UNDERSTAND DATA ON FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. AND JOINT WHAT WE'RE WELL IN WHAT DOESN'T. IN TERMS OF SO PREVENTION I WOULD SAY THE EXACT SAME STRATEGIES ARE NECESSARY IN CALIFORNIA HAS PUT IN PLACE REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO DEVELOP SAYS HAVE PREVENTION PLANTS MANY COUNTIES HAS. HAVE SUICIDE PREVENTION PLANTS THE STATE NOW HAS A SUICIDE PREVENTION PLAN WE CAN DO MORE IN TERMS OF COORDINATING THOSE EFFORTS. ACROSS STATE COUNTY IN SCHOOL DISTRICT BOUNDARIES THERE'S TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS. BUSINESSES AND OTHERS. REALLY FOR BROAD LEVEL PREVENTION BUT SUICIDE PREVENTION IN PARTICULAR. EVEN EXAMPLE. RECENTLY THE STATE PUT IN PLACE A REQUIREMENT THAT EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT HAVE A PLAN. AS A PLAN BUT WE HAVE NOT YET SAT DOWN WITH OUR SCHOOLS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THAT'S WORKING. EVERY SCHOOL IT'S REQUIRED TO DO SO SITE ASSESSMENTS BUT WE DON'T HAVE CONSISTENT STANDARDS THAT ARE HELPING OUR SCHOOLS UNDERSTAND WHICH ASSESSMENT ARE WORKING MOST EFFECTIVELY. WE'RE NOT GATHERING THE DATA TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE HOW THOSE ASSESSMENTS ARE RESULTING IN THE RIGHT KINDS OF HANDOUTS. THOSE ARE CLASSIC OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND HOW TO DO PREVENTION BETTER. ON A PARALLEL TRACK. A NUMBER OF COUNTIES AND SCHOOL PARTNERS. USING SOME OF THE TRIAGE FUNDS THAT THE STATE IS MADE AVAILABLE. AND MORE RECENTLY WE HOPE TO KNOW HOW STUDENT SERVICES ACT DOLLARS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. ARE BEGINNING TO ENGAGE YOUNG PEOPLE TO DEVELOP MENTAL HEALTH STRATEGIES THROUGH THEIR SCHOOLS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE AS WE BEGIN TO REOPEN SCHOOLS AND HAVE HAD A- NEED TO UNDERSTAND. HOW ISOLATION ORDERS WILL IMPACT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. BUT WE SEE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL TO ACTUALLY ENGAGE YOUNG PEOPLE TO HELP EACH OTHER. WITH USED THESE MODELS FOR DECADES BUT WE'VE NOT FULLY DEPLOYED IN CALIFORNIA AND WAYS THAT CAN IMPROVE OUTCOMES AT LOWER COSTS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. REMEMBER ALMOST YOU RECALL THAT WE SPENT SOME TIME WITH YOUR STAFF UP IN- HUMBOLDT COUNTY TALKING TO NATIVE AMERICAN GIVE. AND THAT WE TALK WITH THE COUNTY AND SOME OF THE TRIBES THAT THEIR ABOUT. PEOPLE TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE COULD BETTER TAILOR OUR STRATEGIES. OR IN. THAT WAS A TREMENDOUS UP. TO IS PRETTY. WITH OF TO OPERATE. TO GET. ARC TRIBAL ON TRIBAL THROUGHOUT REGION. IN AT SIMILAR STRATEGY FOR ALL ADULTS WELL OTHER THAT ARE HIGH. THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF. THAT WE NEED BE PURSUED. THAT OUR LOW COST IT WILL HELP OF ABOUT HOW TO MAKE. IT BETTER BANG FOR THE DOLLAR THAT WAS HAVE AVAIL. THANK YOU YOU I. FOR THAT RESPOND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO HIGHLIGHT MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NOT ONLY IN TIMES OF CRISIS BUT WE START TO TALK ABOUT BUDGET. IN TRYING TO- FOR TAKE AWAY AND MONEY FROM VITAL RESOURCES YOU'RE HEARING IT FIRST HAND. THAT MENTAL HEALTH SUICIDE PREVENTION IS SOMETHING THAT CONTINUES NEEDS TO BE INTACT. NOT BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM WITHIN THE BUDGET. BECAUSE THERE STILL IS A LOT OF- HEALING A LOT OF AREAS THAT NEED TO MOVE FORWARD- MISTER EVENING WAS- UP IN HUMBLE- UP IN AND THE TRAVEL COMMUNITY. WHERE THIS RESOURCES IN THIS- COMMUNICATION COORDINATION CONTINUES TO BE NEEDED THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THANK YOU ISSUING FOR BRINGING UP THE THAT THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE WHEN WE START TO TALK ABOUT THESE BUDGET CUTS ALGER'S- CHILD. SUPPORT SERVICES ALL THE AREAS SOMETIMES WE FORGET THAT THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION IS INCLUDED HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN ALL THESE AREAS THAT HAVE HIGHER STATISTICS THAN ANY OTHER GROUP. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WE START TO PULL AWAY RESOURCES. THEN WERE REALLY STARTING TO. EXACERBATE THOSE RATIOS WITHIN DISPARITIES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY MISTER. THANK YOU AND- SEE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS FROMCOMMITTEE MEMBERS I DO THINK THAT- GREAT WAY FOR US TO AND OUR- COMMENTS AND- WOULD JUST- NOTE THAT WE WILL BE KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON.

SO WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO START WITH PUBLIC COMMENT FROM HERE IN THE ROOM. SHARE MEMBERS HELLO AGAIN PARA BEHALF OF OUR MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND POSITION MEMBERS. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED MAYBE BY CRIPPLES THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE CARE AND LESSEN THE ABILITY OF THE STATE TO SAFELY RE OPEN AND KEEP OPENED THE ECONOMY. SEE ME OUTSIDE THE LEGISLATURE TAKE THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS FOR THE FINAL JUNE FIFTEENTH BUDGET. WE ARE SEVEN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE ATTEMPTS TO AGAIN RE LITIGATE THE ISSUE OF WHETHER PROPERTY SIX CAN BE USED TO SUPPLANT GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES. LEGISLATURE HAS TWICE BEFORE SETTLE THISISSUE AND SHOULD ONCE AGAIN REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. THE UNLAWFUL USE OF ONE POINT TWO BILLION AND PROP FIFTY SIX TOBACCO TAX REVENUE COULD REMOVE NEARLY THREE BILLION AND FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING TO ENSURE MEDICAL PATIENTS HAVE ACCESS TO DOCTORS. DENTISTS AND CLINICS IN THEIR DISTRICT. WE ASK YOU AGAIN TO REJECT THE MAY REVISED PROPOSAL TO REPURPOSE PROP FIFTY SIX. WE ALSO ASKED THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISED PROPOSAL TO SIDELINE OVER TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY MEDI CAL PROVIDERS. BY ELIMINATING THE PROP FIFTY SIX LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM. PART OF THE PROPERTY SIX RE PURPOSING- IS THE ELIMINATION OF YEARS TWO THROUGH FIVE OF THE WILDLY SUCCESSFUL LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM. WHICH PLACES DOCTORS AND DENTISTS DIRECTLY COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THERE ARE CURRENTLY OVER ONE THOUSAND APPLICANTS WAITING TO HEAR WHO RECEIVED THE AWARDS BUT THAT ANNOUNCEMENT WAS NEVER MADE LEAVING AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY PROVIDERS. READY TO SERVE MEDI CAL PATIENTS ON THE SIDELINE. TO SUPPORT THE INCREASING MEDI CAL PATIENT CASELOAD THE LEGISLATURE MUST REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET SOLUTION. AND MOVE FORWARD WITH THE OVER TURNED SEVENTY YEAR TO AUTHORITIES. AS MANY OF YOU SEEN IN YOUR DISTRICT THROUGH PRESS EVENTS AND NEWS ARTICLES RELATED TO THE FIRST YEAR AWARD EASE. THE PROGRAM IS VITAL TO PROVIDING CARE CLOSE TO HOME. DOCTOR ARAMBULA FRESNO COUNTY HAD SEVENTEEN PHYSICIAN A DENTIST ORTIZ. THE MEMBER RAMOS HAMMER AND YOU KNOW COUNTY HAD ALMOST THIRTY ORTIZ. ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO LA COUNTY SO FORTY EIGHT PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS DEPLOYED. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER CONTRA COSTA SACRAMENTO IT'S ONE OF COUNTIES COMBINED SON NINETEEN PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS. AND IN RURAL COUNTIES WERE EVERY SINGLE PROVIDER COUNTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU HAD SIX PROVIDERS DEPLOYED AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS BEAT PROVIDERS. YOU MAY ALSO PROPOSES THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED NONPROFIT AND FOR PROFIT INSURERS AND HEALTH PLANS. UTILIZED PLANT MEDICAL SERVICES MONEY TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE PROVIDER NETWORKS. SEEM I GOT A LITTLE CREATIVE AND CAME UP WITH SOME SOLUTIONS. THE CALL THE NINETEEN RECESSION IS THREATENING TO CRIPPLE CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE INFRASTRUCTURE. IF I WAS ALLOWED TO OCCUR HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS WILL BE UNABLE TO MEET THEIR STATUTORY REQUIREMENT. TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE PHYSICIAN NETWORKS AND MEET THE DEMAND FOR MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE. THE FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF PUBLICLY TRADED HEALTH INSURERS. NOTED THAT THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS NOT HAMPER THEIR PROFITABILITY AND THE UTILIZATION OF MEDICAL SERVICES HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED. CREATING A FINANCIAL WINDFALL. THAT NGUYEN FALL CONSISTS OF RESOURCES THAT WERE PLANNED TO BE SPENT BY THE INSURERS ON MEDICAL SERVICES. AND MUST BE REQUIRED TO BE REDIRECTED FROM SHAREHOLDER PROFITS AND INSTEAD MAINTAIN THE STATE'S PROVIDER NETWORKS. HEALTH INSURERS HAVE LARGELY FEEL TO VOLUNTARILY ACT. TO PROTECT THE NETWORKS THAT CONSUMERS. EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE THROUGH MEDI CAL CONTINUE TO PAY MONTHLY PREMIUMS FOR IN ORDER TO ACCESS THAT CARE. THEREFORE ACTION MUST BE TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE SHAREHOLDER PROFITS ARE NOT INCREASED AT THE EXPENSE OF PATIENTS SEEKING CARE. I HOUSEMAN FORSMAN MECHANISMS THAT I RECOMMEND- TO ENSURE THE RESOURCES ARE DEPLOYED APPROPRIATELY. ALMOST DONE THANK YOU- OPTIONS ARE TO CREATE A REQUIREMENT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE CONSIDER HEALTH PLANS OR FOR INSURERS FINANCIAL SUPPORT. OF ITS PROVIDER NETWORKS BETWEEN MARCH ONE TWENTY TWENTY AND JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN THEIR REVIEW OF THE PLANTS- INSURERS ANNUAL HEALTH- ANNUAL RATE INCREASES. TO THE EXTENT THAT A PLAN A RICHER CANNOT ADEQUATELY DEMONSTRATE. HOW ITS RATES SUPPORTED ITS PROVIDER NETWORK DURING THAT TIME. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL NOT APPROVE THESE RATES AND DEEMED THEM AND REASONABLE. ADDING A REQUIREMENT THAT RISK BRING ORGANIZATION CERTIFIED THEIR CONTRACTING HEALTH PLANS. HOW THE A PASSED CAPITATION PAYMENTS DIRECTLY THROUGH THE PROVIDERS. DURING THAT SAME TIME PERIOD. AND LASTLY IT SHOULD BE REQUIRED- I'M SORRY COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS THAT PARTICIPATE IN MEDI CAL SHOULD PROVIDE EVIDENCE THE PROVIDER SUPPORT AS A CONDITION OF CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE. TO THE EXTENT THAT A PLANT CANNOT DEMONSTRATE THIS PROVIDER SUPPORT DURING THAT SAME TIME PERIOD. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WILL TO CLEAR THEM INELIGIBLE TO REMAIN UNDER CONTRACT AND THEY'LL BE BARRED FROM FUTURE PROCUREMENTS FOR FIVE YEARS. IN CLOSING. THIS LEGISLATURE HAS WORKED TIRELESSLY TO ENSURE MEANINGFUL ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE THREATENS TO READ THOSE EFFORTS AND RESCINDED PROMISED ME TO VOTERS WITH THE PASSAGE OF PROP FIFTY SIX. AT THIS MOMENT ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IS CENTRAL TO CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO RE OPEN AND MAINTAIN AN OPEN ECONOMY.

WE OPPOSE REINSTATING THE SENIOR PENALTY WHICH THE CHAIR CHAMPION. UNDER THE PROPOSAL SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES WILL REMAIN SUBJECT TO A LOWER INCOME ELIGIBILITY AND ABOUT A HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS LESS A MONTH AND ANY OTHER ADULTS ON THAT ACCOUNT. THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE STUCK PAYING OVER SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH TO ACCESS NEEDED HEALTHCARE SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. AND THOSE WHO TURN SIXTY FIVE DURING THIS CRISIS WILL LOSE ACCESS TO PRE MEDICARE OUT AS SOON AS THE TEMPORARY FREEZE ON TERMINATION AND- WE OPPOSE THE RELATED REINSTATEMENT AND OUTDATED PROGRAM RULE THAT KICK SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. OFFERING MEDI CAL BASED ON WHO IS PAYING THE MEDICARE PART B. PREMIUM EVEN WHEN THEIR INCOME HASN'T CHANGED. WE SHOULD BE AIMING TO STABILIZE HEALTHCARE COVERAGE RIGHT NOW NOT ADDING ELIGIBILITY RULES THAT CREATE CHAOS.

CURRENTLY ONCE AND MEDICARE BENEFICIARY DIED THE STATE ONLY RECOVERED FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY CARE PAID BY MEDI CAL BUT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO GO BEYOND THAT FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. JERRY COVER FOR ALL MEDI CAL SERVICES EIGHT INCLUDING THE PAYMENT MADE EVERY MONTH TO MEDI CAL PLANNED EVEN WHEN NO HEALTH SERVICES ARGUES. THE LAST THING WE NEED DURING A PANDEMIC IS A PUNITIVE RULED THAT WILL COST OLDER CALIFORNIANS TO GO WITHOUT CARE AND A RULE WHICH EXACERBATES THE RACIAL DISPARITIES IN INTER GENERATIONAL WEALTH TRANSFERRED. BY TART TARGETING THE MODEST HOMES AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE. FINALLY WE WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE NAY REVISION DID NOT INCLUDE MEDICAID EXPANSION TO INCOME ELIGIBLE UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS.

THANK YOU MOM AN- OPERATOR PLEASE GO TO OUR NEXT CALLER PLEASE. EIGHTY NINE GO AHEAD PLEASE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS AND THE ONLY WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO AIDS FOUNDATION THE END THE EPIDEMIC COALITION. CALIFORNIA APPETITE IS ALLIANCE AND THE CALIFORNIA HIV ALLIANCE. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT AND ALSO FOR CREATING THE SPACE FOR WHAT HAS BEEN REALLY COMPELLING AND MOVING COMMENTS THIS MORNING- AND WE JOIN OUR COLLEAGUES URGING YOU TO OPPOSE CRITICAL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE. CUTS NOW WE FOCUS ON PUBLIC HEALTH. AND AGAIN WE REALLY APPRECIATE I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS WE HEARD ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SOMEONE SAID RECENTLY THAT PUBLIC HEALTH IS HONORING. OF OUR INTERDEPENDENCE AND WE APPRECIATE HOW SERIOUSLY THE- COMMITTEE TAKING THAT. AND THE UNDERSTANDING THAT BEEN CLEAR THE PUBLIC HEALTH ENTERED THIS EPIDEMIC. WE UNDER FUNDED AND WE ARE NOW INCREASINGLY STRANGE BY ADDRESSING HOPE IT NINETEEN. SO AS WE ADDRESS AS WE STRUGGLE TO ADDRESS THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC WE CAN'T AFFORD TO PULL BACK ON ADDRESSING THE OTHER THEORIES THAT THE DAMAGE THE CALIFORNIA FACING INCLUDING HIV HEPATITIS B. AND AT BECAUSE IF WE DO THAT IT ONLY DECREASES. IT INCREASES THE DISPARITIES THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN CALIFORNIA AND AS MANY AT THAT IT'S ASKING. THE MOST VULNERABLE TO SEPARATE THEM OUT AGAIN THE ALL OF THESE EPIDEMICS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT ON. THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIA. SO WE CRAFTED FOR PRIORITIES THAT WE WANT TO LIST AND WE CRAFTED THEM WITH THIS CRISIS LINE WERE REALLY ASKING FOR WHAT IS THE MOST MINIMAL JUST. SO THAT WE CAN NOT. REALLY GROUND IN ADDRESSING THAT THE TENANT. THE FIRST ISSUE IS THAT THE FOR PRIOR IS. TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT INVESTMENT IN HIV HEPATITIS C. AND AT THE SERVICE THAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT LAST YEAR ON SMALL INVESTMENT FRANK WAS LEFT IN PLACE IN THE NAY REVISED AND JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE- REMAIN HERE THREE UNDERFUNDED HAVE NOT YET REACHED A LEVEL. OF FUNDING THAT WE HAD PRIOR TO THE TWO THOUSAND NINE CUTS. ON AND THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS IN HEPATITIS B. WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY WAS NO INVESTMENT THAN TO CUT. SO WE REMAIN REALLY UNDERFUNDED BUT WE APPRECIATE VERY MUCH ON THE RETENTION OF THAT SMALL AMOUNT OF FUNDING FROM LAST YEAR. I'M NOT PRIORITY NUMBER TWO IS THAT WE URGE YOU TO REJECT THE NAY REVISION PROPOSAL TO TAKE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN WHAT'S CALLED THE LOAN FROM THE AIDS DRUG ASSISTANCE PROGRAM REBATE FUND. A THAT IS THE BACKBONE OF OUR STATE EFFORT TO KEEP PEOPLE WITH HIV IN THOSE AT RISK HIV AND NECESSARY CARE WITH ACCESS TO TREATMENT. THE REBATE FUND ALLOWS A THAT AND THE CREE EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO ALL WHO NEED IT WITH ABSOLUTELY NOTE STATE GENERAL FUND CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT THE REBATE DOLLARS BE USED EXCLUSIVELY. FOR A THAT SERVICES AND WE'D BE NO GUARANTEE IN THE PROPOSAL THAT. LOAN WILL BE RETURNED OR THAT THERE WON'T BE MORE IN QUOTE AGAIN LOANS THAT ONE BECAUSE THAT WILL BE TAKING THE FUTURE. WE DO THINK THAT FUNDING RIGHT NOW AS PEOPLE ARE IN FINANCIAL CRISIS AND LOSING JOBS AND HEALTHCARE COVERAGE IS. REALLY IRRESPONSIBLE. I'M PRIORITY NUMBER THREE IS TO INCREASE INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA THE RANGE EXCHANGE BY CLEARING HOUSE WERE ASKING FOR A VERY SMALL INVESTMENT OF THREE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. CALIFORNIA THE RANGE SERVICE PROGRAM DISTRIBUTE CRITICAL COMPLIES INCLUDING COVERED NINETEEN SUPPLIES SUCH AS PERSONAL ON PROTECTION EQUIPMENT TO PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THERE OFTEN THE ONLY WELCOME THREE POINT OF HEALTH CARE CONTACT FOR SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. THE HOUSE WOULD NOT BEEN ABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH THE MANTA AND LEFT THE- PROGRAMS WITHOUT THE CENTRAL PLOT. SO SINCE THE CLEARING HOUSE WITH THE FABULIST SIXTEEN NEW RANCH CORPORATE SITE HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED IN FOR MORE EXPECTED TO BE AUTHORIZED IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND THE PENSIONER FOCUSED ON HIGH RISK FOR ALL COUNTY. THE CURRENT CLEARING HOUSE BUDGET THREE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY WITH ALREADY INADEQUATE. AND NOW COLBERT NINETEEN HAS MADE IT HAS INCREASED THE DEMAND FOR SUPPLIES. SO WE UNDERSTAND HOW CHALLENGING THIS FISCAL TIENEN. AND FEEL THIS IS A REALLY SMALL INVESTMENT THAT URGENT URGENTLY NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT WE- CONTINUE THESE LIFESAVING SERVICES AND THE CONNECTION OTHER HEALTHCARE. OUR LAST PRIORITY IS THAT WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR- COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE BURBANK WHAT I'D BE HAPPY TO BE AND AS- EASE. AS YOU CAN ACCORDING OTHER NONPROFIT NONPROFIT ENTITIES. ON OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT SHE NO PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE THEY ARE ABLE TO REACH OUT TO VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS. WHO OTHER PEOPLE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REACH OUT TO. ONLY NAY OR DON'T TAX TO. NO HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. A LOT OF CBO AS WITH SO MANY OTHER ENTITIES THAT BLOCKS FUNDING BECAUSE OF COVERT NINETEEN AND ARE REALLY STRUGGLING TO RESPOND TO COPE IN NINETEEN AND ALSO AT THE SAME TIME. THE ACTUAL H. D. H. B. AND AT HER BECAUSE- SO WE RECENTLY DID A SURVEY WITH ON OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND EVEN THOUGH MANY OF THAT HAVE APPLIED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING. IT'S STILL GOING TO BE YOU KNOW VERY ITS RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE THE COURT IS STILL GOING TO BE AN ADEQUATE TO MAINTAIN EXISTING SERVICES. EVEN WITH IT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES. 66% OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS RESPOND HERS ANTICIPATED BEING ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO CHANGE. AND THAT THE OVERALL NOW WITH THE PROXIMITY FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ACROSS THE ON. OUR KIDS ARE BY RESPONDED WITHOUT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES 40% OF THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO FURTHER REDUCE SERVICES 17% WILL HAVE TO FURLOUGH STAFF 21% WILL BE REQUIRED TO LAY OFF YEAH THIS IS ALSO THE CONTACT THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING RE DIRECT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST KOBE EIGHTEEN MANY. STAFF SO WE WOULD ASK AS YOU CONSIDER- COVERED NINETEEN ECONOMIC RELIEF PACKAGES. REALLY URGING YOU TO CONSIDER FINANCIAL SUPPORT THE TYPICALLY FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE HIV. HURT PEOPLE WITH HIV HEPATITIS C. AND AT TD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MA'AM AND- OPERATOR BEFORE WE GO TO THE NEXT CALL I MADE JUST.

WE HAVE SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL TO THE COMMITTEE TO EXTEND THE CURRENT SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING SOURCE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE SAME FOUR DOLLAR PENALTY ON MOVING VIOLATIONS.
