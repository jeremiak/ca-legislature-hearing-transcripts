BEFORE YOU IT'S PART OF THIS

00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:52.118
BUDGET PROCESS.

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:53.886
WANTED TO GIVE YOU JUST A BRIEF

00:05:53.953 --> 00:05:55.388
OVERVIEW OF THE DIFFERENCES AND

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:58.324
AND THIS TRAILER BILL VERSES THE

00:05:58.391 --> 00:05:59.192
THE BILL THAT.

00:05:59.258 --> 00:05:59.959
COMMITTEE LAST YEAR WE

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:00.660
APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF THIS

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:03.096
COMMITTEE AS IT MOVES FORWARD.

00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:04.497
SO ONE OF THE CHANGES IN THAT

00:06:04.564 --> 00:06:05.965
TRAILER BILL IS -- LAST YEAR

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.667
THERE WAS A RANGE FROM TWENTY TO

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:08.835
EIGHTY CENTS THIS YEAR WE'VE

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:10.503
REMOVE THAT BOTTOM END SO

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.605
ESSENTIALLY IT'S ZERO TO EIGHTY

00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:14.574
SENSES THE RANGE -- THAT THAT

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.408
BILL CAN BE SET.

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:16.943
THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF DISCUSSION

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:18.711
IN THE FLOOR DEBATE LAST YEAR

00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:20.446
AND AS WITH THE PREVIOUS VERSION

00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:21.547
OF THE TRAILER BILL AND HOW

00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:23.783
EXACTLY THAT RATE WOULD BE SAT.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.485
SO WE WANTED TO KIND OF BRING

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:26.819
THAT BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE TO

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:28.821
MAKE SURE THAT -- YOU KNOW YOU

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:30.056
WERE AWARE OF OUR ROLE IN THAT

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:31.958
PROCESS SO EACH YEAR WE TAKE A

00:06:32.024 --> 00:06:34.327
LOOK AT WHAT WE NEED TO FIND

00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:35.661
NINE ONE ONE FOR THE STATE.

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:37.730

THAT NUMBER COMES BACK TO ME AND

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:56.749
THAT'S THE BASELINE IN THIS

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:58.818
LEGISLATION BY WHICH WE SET THE

00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:01.187

APPROPRIATED AMOUNTS TO TAKE

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:06.559
THAT APPROPRIATE AMOUNT.

00:07:06.626 --> 00:07:08.027
COMPARED TO THE NUMBER OF ACCESS

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.231
AND THEN IT'S JUST SIMPLE MATH

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:13.633
TO CALCULATE HOW MUCH THE FEE

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:15.168
NEEDS TO BE ASSESSED ON A

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:16.269
MONTHLY BASIS.

00:07:16.335 --> 00:07:18.771
IN ORDER TO GENERATE THE REVENUE

00:07:18.838 --> 00:07:19.972
TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM.

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:22.241
AND THAT FEE IS PASSED BACK OVER

00:07:22.308 --> 00:07:23.009
TO CD TFA.

00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:24.677
WHO ESTABLISHES THE FEE FOR THE

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:25.678
UPCOMING YEAR SO THERE'S A

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:27.547
NUMBER OF CHECKS AND BALANCES IN

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:29.549
THIS PROCESS A AND A AND ALONG

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:30.283
THE WAY?

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:31.350
IN OUR NEXT YEAR WILL BE BACK

00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:36.789
AGAIN TO MAKE SURE THAT LEVEL IS

00:07:36.856 --> 00:07:38.324
IS SET APPROPRIATELY.

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:38.858
THE OTHER CHANGE IN THE

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:40.927
LEGISLATION FROM LAST YEAR.

00:07:40.993 --> 00:07:41.093
WAS.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.764
WE WE DEFINE.

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:47.166
THE ALL THE NINE ONE FEES ALL

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:48.768
FEES ARE SO SHE WOULD NINE ONE

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:51.404
INSIDE THIS REVENUE TAX CODE.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.238
FOR NINE ONE THE LINKAGES TO

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:54.040
OTHER PIECES OF REVENUE AND TAX

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:57.009
CODE -- SECTIONS JUST TO MAKE IT

00:07:57.076 --> 00:07:58.678
CLEAN IF IT'S NINE ONE IT'S IN

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:00.646
THE EMERGENCY TELEPHONE

00:08:00.713 --> 00:08:02.114
SURCHARGE USERS ACT OR THE STE

00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:03.282
WHICH GOES INTO THE STATE

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:05.284
EMERGENCY TELEPHONE NUMBER

00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:06.285
ACCOUNT OR SET NOT.

00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:09.021
AND THEN FINALLY -- WE AN

00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:10.389
INCREASE THE AND WE WE DEFINE

00:08:10.456 --> 00:08:12.892
NEXT AND I'M A ONE IN SUCH A WAY.

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:14.026
THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE THE

00:08:14.093 --> 00:08:16.762
INFORMATION THAT'S IN NEXT GEN

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:17.897
NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM. FOR ALERT

00:08:17.964 --> 00:08:20.032
MORNINGS SO YOU'LL SEE THAT

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:21.767
DEFINITIONS EXPANDED ON THE

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:23.302
BENEFIT OF HAVING A STATEWIDE

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:25.238
TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM THAT'S

00:08:25.304 --> 00:08:26.672
CAPABLEOF DELIVERING A LEARNED

00:08:26.739 --> 00:08:27.373
WARNINGS IS.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.475
OBVIOUSLY VERY RELEVANT IN THE

00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:30.743
DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE GOING ON

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.511
THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND SO THIS

00:08:32.578 --> 00:08:34.981
DEFINITION MAKE SURE THAT NEXT

00:08:35.047 --> 00:08:36.249
GEN I'M ONE CAN SUPPORT THAT.

00:08:36.315 --> 00:08:37.750
IT DOESN'T IMPACT THE LOCAL

00:08:37.817 --> 00:08:40.152
AUTHORITIES -- ABILITY TO SEND

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:41.587
AN ALERT MORNING THAT'S A

00:08:41.654 --> 00:08:42.855
DIFFERENT PROCESS IS JUST A

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:46.525
COMMON TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. FOR

00:08:46.592 --> 00:08:48.327
THAT.

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:50.129
AND THE OTHER THING WE WANTED TO

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:51.364
MENTION IS -- THE THE GOVERNOR'S

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.132
BUDGET INCLUDES THIS FIFTY

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.567
MILLION DOLLARS TO GET US

00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:56.202
THROUGH THE END OF THIS YEAR AND

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:57.570
INTO NEXT YEAR.

00:08:57.637 --> 00:08:58.704
BUT ONE TO MENTION THAT.

00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:01.874
WHILE THESE ONE TIME FUNDING --

00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:04.243
INCREASES ARE HELPFUL TO GET US

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.444
THROUGH THESE INTERIM STEPS WILL

00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:07.213
REALLY NEED IS A LONG TERM

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.682
SUSTAINABLE FUNDING MODEL.

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:11.384
WE MANAGE MULTIPLE CONTRACTS

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:14.787
THAT GO OVER MULTIPLE YEARS --

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:16.289
SOME TEN YEARS AND L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G.&lt;/c&gt;

00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:18.324
SO HAVING A YEAR TO YEAR FUNDING

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.959
MECHANISM TO SUPPORT A TEN YEAR

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:21.093
CONTRACT.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.862
IS VERY CHALLENGING FOR THE

00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:24.163
PROGRAM WHEN YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.765
ENTER INTO A CONTRACTUAL

00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:29.535
AGREEMENT AND AND YOU'RE NOT

00:09:29.602 --> 00:09:30.803
SURE THE FINDINGS THERE SO.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.705
HISTORICALLY THE SET IN A FUND

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:33.639
HAS BEEN A A FEE.

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:36.542
AND IT HAS SUPPORTED NINE ONE

00:09:36.609 --> 00:09:38.010
ONE FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS AND

00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:39.378
HAS PROVEN TO BE ONE OF THE MOST

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:41.080
EFFECTIVE FUNDING MODELS THAT WE

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:41.814
HAVE.

00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:44.116
AND SO THAT'S WHERE THIS -- NEW

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:45.318
FUNDING MODEL FOCUSES ON

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:47.219
ESTABLISHING A LONG TERM

00:09:47.286 --> 00:09:48.854
SUSTAINABLE MODEL.

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:50.089
WITH THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:52.391
ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:54.927

WHETHER WE WILL BE RECEIVING A

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:10.776
CHANGE IN THIS.

00:10:10.843 --> 00:10:16.682
ITEM WITH THE MAY REVISION.

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:17.616
I'M SURE STEVEN BANDS WITH THE

THAT THERE WOULD BE BUT THAT IT

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:35.067
WAS ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY.

00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:35.768
I'M.

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:40.606
MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A THERE ARE.

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:51.117
SUPPORT.

00:10:51.183 --> 00:10:52.718
THE IMPLEMENTATION ONGOING

00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:54.687

[inaudible]

00:11:17.476 --> 00:11:19.578
AND THEN.

00:11:19.645 --> 00:11:20.746
WE CASTING THE FEE FROM A

00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:23.616
PERCENTAGE RATE SURCHARGE TO A

00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:25.017
FLAT RATE FEE.

00:11:25.084 --> 00:11:27.319
WHAT'S THE AVERAGE FLAT RATE FEE

00:11:27.386 --> 00:11:28.721
BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE THAT WAS

00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:31.557
AT SIXTY CENTS IS A NINETY CENT.

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:33.492
YEAH SO THAT THAT'S A REALLY

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:34.660
INTERESTING QUESTION SO.

00:11:34.727 --> 00:11:36.195
RIGHT NOW THE FEE AS SET BASED

00:11:36.262 --> 00:11:39.031
ON INTRASTATE VOICE REVENUE --

00:11:39.098 --> 00:11:42.134
AND SO THAT VARIES FROM.

00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:43.636
THE CALCULATION OF THE REVENUE

00:11:43.702 --> 00:11:45.871
BROUGHT IN WHETHER IT'S WIRELINE

00:11:45.938 --> 00:11:49.041
WIRELESS VOICE OVER IP.

00:11:49.108 --> 00:11:50.976

THOSE REVENUE STREAMS HAVE A

00:11:52.912 --> 00:11:54.580
DIFFERENT PORTION ALLOCATED TO

00:11:54.647 --> 00:11:56.582
VOICE.

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:57.983
AND DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE FROM

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.418
THE NUMBERS THE EXACT RATES BUT

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:01.087
WHAT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT

00:12:01.153 --> 00:12:02.755
WIRELINE PAYS A DISPROPORTIONATE

00:12:02.822 --> 00:12:04.323
AMOUNT.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.991
IF YOU HAVE A HARD LINE WIRELINE

PAYING A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT.

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:14.300
COMPARED TO WIRELESS WHERE THE

00:12:14.366 --> 00:12:16.335
BULK OF THE REVENUE ASSOCIATED

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:18.037
WITH A WIRELESS BILL IS REALLY

00:12:18.104 --> 00:12:18.838
FOR DATA.

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:21.674
IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR WIRELESS

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.008
BUILD REGARDLESS OF CARRIER.

00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:24.210
VOICES ALMOST FREE AND IT'S A

00:12:24.276 --> 00:12:25.711
VERY SMALL PORTION OF THE

00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:27.413
OVERALL BILL THAT'S REALLY

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.881
WHAT'S CAUSING THE DECLINE IN

00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:29.682
REVENUE.

00:12:29.748 --> 00:12:31.784
THE BULK OF OUR USERS ARE PAYING

00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:33.152
THE SMALLEST.

00:12:33.219 --> 00:12:35.354
PERCENTAGE OF OF THE OVERALL

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:37.823
FEES SO 80% ROUGHLY OF OUR NINE

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:39.058
ONE CALLS COME FROM WIRELESS

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:40.226
DEVICES.

00:12:40.292 --> 00:12:41.894
YET THE REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:43.829
THOSE WIRELESS USERS IS THE

00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:45.898
LOWEST OF THE THREE CATS.

00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:46.632
THE FOUR CATEGORIES CENTER IN

00:12:46.699 --> 00:12:48.434
THERE AND WHAT THIS PROPOSAL

00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:50.269
DOES THE IS IT JUST ESTABLISH

00:12:50.336 --> 00:12:52.004
THE MALL THE SAME SETS THE SAME

00:12:52.071 --> 00:12:53.038
EXACT RATE.

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:54.507
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU'RE

USER WIRELESS USER OUR MOBILE

00:12:58.544 --> 00:12:59.712
PREPAID.

00:12:59.778 --> 00:13:01.514
THIS IS ALSO THE SAME SAME MODEL

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.183
THAT'S USED IN EVERY OTHER STATE.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.584
WE'VE DONE AN ANALYSIS OF ALL

00:13:05.651 --> 00:13:06.952
THE OTHER STATES ARE DOING THIS

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:08.821
AND IT'S THE SAME. TWO NOTABLE

00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:10.322
EXCEPTIONS TO THAT BUT PRETTY

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:13.859
MUCH EVERYBODY'S IN THE SAME

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:15.628
FLAT FEE MODEL.

00:13:15.694 --> 00:13:16.128
IS THAT ENSURE QUESTION

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:16.428
[inaudible]

00:13:16.495 --> 00:13:19.465
NO.

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:20.032
I'M SO THE TRIAL DIFFERENTLY

A NICKEL.

00:13:27.773 --> 00:13:29.441
SO NOTHING YET SO THE NUMBERS

00:13:29.508 --> 00:13:31.277
THAT I HAVE ARE ONLY ESTIMATES

ESTIMATES WE CAN GIVE YOU THOSE

00:13:37.183 --> 00:13:38.083
SO.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.153
WIRELINE NUMBERS ARE ROUGHLY.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.421
TWENTY SEVEN CENTS WE THINK

00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:44.056
BASED ON THE NUMBERS WE HAVE

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:46.625
ACCESS -- TO VOICE OVER IP IS

00:13:46.692 --> 00:13:48.827
PROBABLY LESS THAN FIVE CENTS

00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:50.863
AND WIRELESS IS A LITTLE BIT

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.032
OVER FIVE CENTS AND AGAIN.

00:13:53.098 --> 00:13:55.434
WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE DATA

00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:57.169
TO GIVE YOU A DEFINITIVE NUMBER

00:13:57.236 --> 00:13:58.771
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE'S A

00:13:58.837 --> 00:14:00.239
DISPROPORTIONATE.

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:01.707
LEVEL IN AND HOW IT'S

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:03.876
DISTRIBUTED TODAY SO HOPEFULLY

00:14:03.943 --> 00:14:05.110
THAT'S HELPFUL AGAIN.

00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:07.246
ROUGH ORDER OF MAGNITUDE NUMBERS

00:14:07.313 --> 00:14:08.480
BASED ON OUR ESTIMATES AN

00:14:08.547 --> 00:14:11.850
INCREASE OF FOUR THOUSAND FORTY

00:14:11.917 --> 00:14:12.718
TIMES RIGHT I MEAN THIS IS A

00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:14.486
REFER SOMEONE ON WIRELESS AVOID

00:14:14.553 --> 00:14:16.455
THEY'RE GONNA GET A WE'RE GONNA

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:20.159
SEE SOMETHING IN THEIR BILL.

00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:21.227
SO THERE WILL BE A DIFFERENCE

00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:22.728
BUT IT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A

00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:23.996
ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE YOU'RE NOT

00:14:24.063 --> 00:14:26.765
GONNA SEE A SIX DOLLAR INCREASE

00:14:26.832 --> 00:14:27.299
PER MONTH.

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:28.801
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING

00:14:28.867 --> 00:14:30.336
LESS THAN THE CUP OF THE PRICE

00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:32.171
OF A CUP OF COFFEE. FOR THE

00:14:32.238 --> 00:14:35.441
ENTIRE YEAR TO GET A SUSTAINABLE

00:14:35.507 --> 00:14:37.042
NINE ONE PROGRAM RIGHT IN -- AND

00:14:37.109 --> 00:14:38.210
IN THE BOTTOM LINE IS AS AS

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:39.645
MITCH SAID.

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:40.746
THE REVENUES WE BRING AND JUST

00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:44.316
SIMPLY DON'T SUPPORT THE PROGRAM.

00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:46.051
YOU KNOW IT IF IF THERE WAS

00:14:46.118 --> 00:14:47.586
ANOTHER WAY -- WE YOU KNOW WE

00:14:47.653 --> 00:14:48.854
WOULD BE ALL FOR IT BUT AND WE

00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:50.322
NEED A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:52.758
SOURCE. FOR NINE ONE ONE NINE

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:54.660
ONE FAILS LIVES ARE AT RISK AND

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:56.962
WE WE JUST SIMPLY CANNOT ALLOW

00:14:57.029 --> 00:14:59.231
NINE ONE FAIL.

00:14:59.298 --> 00:15:00.766
YOU'VE HAD A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM OF

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:02.601
PEOPLE TRANSFERRED FROM HARD

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:05.204
LINES TO WIRELESS.

00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:06.038
AND THIS BEEN GOING ON FOR WHAT

00:15:06.105 --> 00:15:07.573
THIRTY YEARS.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.707
AND SO NOW WE'RE FINALLY

00:15:08.774 --> 00:15:09.875
REACTING AND WE'RE GOING FROM A

00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:11.944
NICKEL TO EIGHTY CENTS AS

00:15:12.011 --> 00:15:13.045
OPPOSED TO A NICKEL TO DRAW A

00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:15.481
DIME. FIFTEEN TO TWENTY RAISING

00:15:15.547 --> 00:15:17.416
IN OVERTIME SO THIS IS JUST

00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:19.585
GONNA REQUIRED TWO THIRDS VOTE

00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:21.220
MANAGER.

00:15:21.287 --> 00:15:21.787
BUT THIS BE CONSIDERED A TAX

00:15:21.854 --> 00:15:23.188
INCREASE.

00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:24.056
YES THE TRAILER BILL WOULD

00:15:24.123 --> 00:15:26.792
REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS.

00:15:26.859 --> 00:15:27.960
ALRIGHT WE'RE BACK TO WHERE WE

00:15:28.027 --> 00:15:29.161
WERE LAST YEAR.

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:30.963
I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE POINT OF

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.898
CLARIFICATION WHILE THE TRAILER

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:36.302
BILL ALLOWS A RANGE OF ZERO TO

00:15:36.368 --> 00:15:38.070
EIGHTY IT WILL NOT BE SET AT

00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:39.672
EIGHTY THE RANGE THAT SAT IS

00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:40.939
GOING TO BE DEPENDENT UPON THE

00:15:41.006 --> 00:15:42.975
APPROPRIATION THAT'S GIVEN TO

00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:44.476
CALLOW YES BY.

00:15:44.543 --> 00:15:45.210
NO BY BOTH THE SENATE AND THE

00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:47.613
ASSEMBLY AS APPROVED BY THE AS

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.947
PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR'S

00:15:49.014 --> 00:15:51.450
OFFICE AND OUR ESTIMATES ARE

00:15:51.517 --> 00:15:54.953
PATIENT IT'S UP TO NOT TO EXCEED

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.889
BUT IT WRECKED BUT IT WOULD NOT.

00:15:56.955 --> 00:15:57.856
IN WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IT

00:15:57.923 --> 00:15:59.558
WOULD NOT UNLESS WE WERE TO

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:01.293
APPROPRIATE A VERY SIGNIFICANT

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.529
INCREASE IT WOULD NOT GO UP TO

00:16:03.595 --> 00:16:06.131
THAT FOR PER CELLULAR USER

00:16:06.198 --> 00:16:08.067
THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT --

00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:13.305
AND WHAT IT THE SP IS IT MORE-ACCURATE OR CAN YOU.

00:16:13.372 --> 00:16:15.974
COULD YOU. FIVE GIVE US SOME

00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:18.677
SOME SENSE THAT IT WOULD BE.

00:16:18.744 --> 00:16:22.047
MORE ON THE BORDER OF THAT WHAT

00:16:22.114 --> 00:16:24.950
IS WHAT THE SO USER WOULD

00:16:25.017 --> 00:16:26.352
EXPERIENCE IF WE WERE TO APPROVE

00:16:26.418 --> 00:16:27.853
THIS WOULD BE MORE ON THE ORDER

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.756
OF WHAT THE HARD LINE.

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:33.258
USER IS NOW PAYING.

00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:34.927
SO IF I COULD HAVE.

00:16:34.993 --> 00:16:37.996
SO BASED ON THE CURRENT --

00:16:38.063 --> 00:16:40.332
PROPOSED APPROPRIATION LEVEL THE

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:41.734
ESTIMATE IS THAT THE FEE WOULD

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.169
INITIALLY BE SET IN THE THIRTY

00:16:44.236 --> 00:16:46.138
THREE THIRTY FOUR CENTS RANGE --

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:47.573
AND I COULD SAY LIKE FOR EXAMPLE

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:49.541
LOOKINGAT MY OWN PERSONAL CELL

00:16:49.608 --> 00:16:51.810
PHONE BILL I PAY NINE CENTS A

00:16:51.877 --> 00:16:53.912
MONTH -- FOR NINE ONE ONE SO FOR

00:16:53.979 --> 00:16:55.447
ME IT WOULD GO FROM NINE CENTS

00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:57.349
TO THIRTY THREE CENTS -- IS THE

00:16:57.416 --> 00:16:58.684
CURRENT ESTIMATE.

00:16:58.751 --> 00:17:03.589
OF THE IMPACT AT THIS POINT.

00:17:03.655 --> 00:17:05.057
CONTINUE TO OUR NORTH I THINK

00:17:05.124 --> 00:17:06.425
THAT'S IT I'M I'M JUST.

00:17:06.492 --> 00:17:08.827
YOU KNOW WE GOT A CONTACT HERE

00:17:08.894 --> 00:17:10.362
IN A WATER TAX THERE AND BEFORE

00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:12.164
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A CUP OF

00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:14.133
COFFEE ANYMORE IT'S A GALLON.

00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:15.434
AND SO I JUST WANNA.

00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:16.402
BUT IF RESPECT.

00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:18.003
THANK WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE TO

HAD ANOTHER WAY -- TO TO DO THIS

00:17:22.741 --> 00:17:24.943
WE WOULD CERTAINLY BE MINIMAL

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.179
AYE AYE I CAN TELL YOU THAT WERE.

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:28.213
NOW WE WERE WERE NOT WE DON'T

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.281
HAVE ENOUGH REVENUE TO SUPPORT

00:17:29.348 --> 00:17:30.482
THE PROGRAM.

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:32.017
AND IT IS TO CRITICAL IT IS

00:17:32.084 --> 00:17:33.752
ABSOLUTELY THE THE START POINT

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:35.053
FOR EVERYTHING WE DO.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.756
AND FOR EVERY EMERGENCY AND AS

00:17:37.823 --> 00:17:39.858
MUCH SAID FIVE NINE ONE FAILS

00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:41.994
LIVES -- FIVE SERVER IN JEOPARDY

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:46.899
AND SO -- IN.

00:17:46.965 --> 00:17:48.267
WE'VE WE'VE GOT A SUPPORT.

00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:50.135
I'M NOT ARGUING THAT POINT --

00:17:50.202 --> 00:17:52.171
THE ISSUE IS AT A BUDGET IS A

00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:53.605
REFLECTION OF PRIORITIES.

00:17:53.672 --> 00:17:56.141
AND SO WE HAVE STILL TWENTY ONE

00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:59.144
AND A HALF BILLION OF SURPLUS AS

00:17:59.211 --> 00:17:59.411
THE TERM.

00:17:59.478 --> 00:18:00.078
BEING USED.

00:18:00.145 --> 00:18:02.181
AND SO.

00:18:02.247 --> 00:18:03.515
WHY IS?

00:18:03.582 --> 00:18:05.918
A GOOD PORTION OF THAT OR A

00:18:05.984 --> 00:18:06.318
PORTION OF THAT.

00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:07.886
BUT IN TO HELP YOU THAT BEING

00:18:07.953 --> 00:18:09.521
PAYS DOWN AND THEN YOUR RATES

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:10.889
BEING PHASED IN.

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:13.292
OVER TIME SO YOU MEET YOUR HAPPY.

00:18:13.358 --> 00:18:14.827

THERE IN THE FUTURE YOU HAVE A

00:18:16.094 --> 00:18:17.663
FUNDING SOURCE THAT'S MORE

00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:19.731
PREDICTABLE -- BUT I'M I'M JUST

00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:21.567
CONCERNED.

00:18:21.633 --> 00:18:23.469
BECAUSE EVEN THE MEDIA IS

00:18:23.535 --> 00:18:24.269
ALREADY SAYING HOW DO YOU DO A%

00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:26.472
TAX INCREASE WHEN YOU'VE GOT A

00:18:26.538 --> 00:18:27.306
TWENTY ONE AND A HALF BILLION

00:18:27.372 --> 00:18:27.573
DOLLARS.

00:18:27.639 --> 00:18:30.142
SO WE'RE ALL GONNA HAVE TO DEAL

00:18:30.209 --> 00:18:31.376
WITH AND I JUST WANTED.

00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:32.678

00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:35.481
IF I COULD JUST CLARIFY TO YOUR

00:18:35.547 --> 00:18:36.682
FIRST QUESTION I DO HAVE

00:18:36.748 --> 00:18:38.083
CONFIRMATION THE MILLION DOLLARS

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.385
IS THE ON GOING COSTS THE SIX

00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:40.953
POSITIONS [inaudible]

00:18:41.019 --> 00:18:42.754
YEAH.

00:18:42.821 --> 00:18:43.789
IN TO CERTAIN EXTENT WE ARE

00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:45.858
BOUNCING THAT ONE TIME USE

00:18:45.924 --> 00:18:46.925
THAT'S WITH A FIFTY MILLION

00:18:46.992 --> 00:18:48.594
DOLLAR TRANSFER IS IS A ONE TIME

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.729
GENERAL FUND TRANSFER SO THAT WE

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:51.163
CAN.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.698
HELP WITH THAT -- STRUCTURAL

00:18:52.764 --> 00:18:54.900
DEFICIT BUT ALSO SOME OF THE ONE

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:56.702
TIME COSTS FOR THE SWITCH. TO

00:18:56.768 --> 00:18:58.036
MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE FEE

00:18:58.103 --> 00:18:59.538
IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT FIFTY

00:18:59.605 --> 00:19:00.272
MILLION DOLLAR TRANSFER THIS

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:01.106
YEAR.

00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:02.941
THEN THE THIRTY THREE CENTS THAT

00:19:03.008 --> 00:19:04.009
I WAS CITING EARLIER IS OUR

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:05.711
CURRENT ESTIMATE WOULD OBVIOUSLY

00:19:05.777 --> 00:19:07.746
GO UP BECAUSE WE HAVE TO COVER --

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:10.249
BASICALLY PAYING BACK WHATEVER

00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:12.451
SORT OF GENERAL FUND ON WE DID.

00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:13.952
TO TO BRIDGE THE GAP.

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:14.653
WE ARE WE ARE USING THE ONE TIME.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.854
THE SURPLUS IS THAT WE HAVE

00:19:15.921 --> 00:19:17.322
RIGHT NOW TO HELP OUT WITH THIS

00:19:17.389 --> 00:19:18.790
PROGRAM AS WELL [inaudible]

00:19:18.857 --> 00:19:20.592
I'M.

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:22.294
I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTIONS

00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:24.496
BECAUSE IT WAS.

00:19:24.563 --> 00:19:26.064
NOT FULLY CLEAR FROM THE ITEM

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:30.969
WHAT THE ACTUAL IMPACT.

00:19:31.036 --> 00:19:32.738
FOR CELLULAR USER WOULD BE.

00:19:32.804 --> 00:19:35.073
AND THE WIRELESS USER HOWEVER WE

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:37.743
WANT TO DESCRIBE IT AND YOU KNOW

00:19:37.809 --> 00:19:40.579
I EIGHT I WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF

00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:43.248
OUR ACTING LAST YEAR BECAUSE I

00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:44.683
DON'T RECALL RIGHT NOW WHETHER

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:50.656
IT WOULD HAVE -- RESULTED IN A A

00:19:50.722 --> 00:19:51.957
THIRTY THREE CENTS SAID.

00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:54.693
INCREASE TO THE PER USER OR

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.094
WHATEVER WHETHER IT WOULD HAVE

00:19:56.161 --> 00:19:59.398
BEEN SLIGHTLY LOWER SO THAT THEN

00:19:59.464 --> 00:20:00.032
YOU KNOW WE COULD HAVE HAD THAT

00:20:00.098 --> 00:20:00.632
MORE.

00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:03.302
GRADUATED AS PRE DATED AS YOUR

00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:05.070
DESCRIBING.

00:20:05.137 --> 00:20:06.772
BUT I I KNOW I TOTALLY

00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:08.206
APPRECIATE THE POINT THAT YES WE

00:20:08.273 --> 00:20:09.675
HAVE.

00:20:09.741 --> 00:20:12.811
WE WE HAVE MORE REVENUES NOW

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:14.746
THEN THE BUDGET THAT'S PROPOSED.

00:20:14.813 --> 00:20:16.548
BUT THIS IS ONE OF THESE ON

00:20:16.615 --> 00:20:18.250
GOING EXPENSES.

00:20:18.317 --> 00:20:20.252
AND IT'S ONE OF THESE WHERE WE

00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:23.088
ARE WE ARE GOING TO BE TWENTY
