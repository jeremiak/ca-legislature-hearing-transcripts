I CAME TO MY ATTENTION LAST YEAR

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.015
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OF OCT

INDEPENDENCE BY MERGERS FUNDERS

00:40:52.683 --> 00:40:54.451
WAS ILLEGAL IN CALIFORNIA.

00:40:54.518 --> 00:40:55.653
HOW THE PRACTICE IS COMMON IN MY

00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:56.520
FIELD AND OCCURS ON A REGULAR

00:40:56.587 --> 00:40:58.189
BASIS NO SURPRISE TO ME THAT

00:40:58.255 --> 00:40:58.889
THAT WAS NOT?

00:40:58.956 --> 00:41:01.225

00:41:11.969 --> 00:41:12.503
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:13.270
ILLEGAL.

00:41:13.337 --> 00:41:14.872
ANIMALS CAN EASILY BECOME

00:41:14.939 --> 00:41:15.506

00:41:15.573 --> 00:41:16.173
THEY CATCH ON FIRE AND

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.675
FIREFIGHTERS ARE OFTEN ABLE TO

00:41:21.011 --> 00:41:21.512
WHATEVER WE CAN TO HELP SAVE

00:41:21.579 --> 00:41:22.646

START WITH UP A PERSONAL

00:52:14.231 --> 00:52:15.832
PERSPECTIVE --

00:52:15.899 --> 00:52:17.501
TWENTY YEARS AGO ACTUALLY A LAST

00:52:17.567 --> 00:52:18.802
MONTH MY FATHER WAS DIAGNOSED

00:52:18.869 --> 00:52:21.404
WITH LUNG CANCER AND HAD SURGERY

00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:23.073

MEDICATIONS AND AND I WAS KIND

00:52:24.941 --> 00:52:26.142
OF STARTLED BY SOME OF THE

FINDINGS THAN ON HE WAS JUST

CONTINUED ON A MEDICATION THAT

00:52:28.812 --> 00:52:29.613
WAS IMPORTANT TO PREVENT

00:52:29.679 --> 00:52:30.347
SWELLING.

00:52:30.413 --> 00:52:32.282
OF HIS BRAIN WHEN HE WAS ON

00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:34.217
DISCHARGED TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL I

00:52:34.284 --> 00:52:36.219
THAT THE HOSPITAL DID NOT KNOW

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:37.420
THAT HE WAS ON THE MEDICATION

00:52:37.487 --> 00:52:39.155
WHICH CREATED ALL SORTS OF AND

00:52:39.222 --> 00:52:40.423
TOWARD SIDE EFFECTS.

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:42.025
HE ALSO HAD OTHER --

00:52:42.092 --> 00:52:44.895
COMORBIDITY TREATED EFFECTIVELY

00:52:44.961 --> 00:52:47.330
JUST BECAUSE OF LAPSES IN

00:52:47.397 --> 00:52:48.431
GETTING AN ACCURATE MEDICATION

00:52:48.498 --> 00:52:48.698
HISTORY.

00:52:48.765 --> 00:52:50.133
OF THE I VOWED THEN THAT THIS

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.768
WOULD BE MY CAREER GOAL TO MAKE

00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:53.503
SOMETHING HAPPEN TO ENSURE THE

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:54.838
ACCURACY OF MEDICATION LAST.

00:52:54.905 --> 00:52:56.339
MANY YEARS LATER MORE RECENTLY

THOUSAND SUBSEQUENT

00:53:12.322 --> 00:53:13.156
HOSPITALIZATIONS.

00:53:13.223 --> 00:53:14.824
THAT'S MY PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE

00:53:14.891 --> 00:53:16.693
FROM MY PROFESSIONS PURPOSE

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:17.260

FACT THAT AND IN THE REAL LIFE

00:53:22.465 --> 00:53:23.400
SETTING --

00:53:23.466 --> 00:53:25.402
THESE MEDICATION LESS WHICH FORM

00:53:25.468 --> 00:53:27.370
THE BASIS OF ORDERS.

00:53:27.437 --> 00:53:29.105
ARE CREATED BY NUMBER OF

00:53:29.172 --> 00:53:29.639
INDIVIDUALS AND DIFFERENT

00:53:29.706 --> 00:53:30.974
PRACTICE SETTINGS ON A DOCTOR'S

00:53:31.041 --> 00:53:32.008
OFFICE YOU MIGHT HAVE MEDICAL

TAKEN MEDICATION LIST.

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:37.914
THAT THEN BECOMES THE BASIS OF

00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:39.916
FUTURE ORDERS AGAIN THROUGH MY

00:53:39.983 --> 00:53:40.984
CAREER IN PHARMACY AYE WHAT

00:53:41.051 --> 00:53:42.752
WITNESS THE EXPLOSION OF COMPLEX

00:53:42.819 --> 00:53:43.954
NEW MEDICATIONS TO TREAT A

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:45.422
VARIETY OF DISEASES WE REALLY

00:53:45.488 --> 00:53:46.690
HAVE A HUGE OUR MOMENTARY

00:53:46.756 --> 00:53:48.024
MEDICATIONS AVAILABLE.

00:53:48.091 --> 00:53:50.026
WE HAVE AN ELDERLY POPULATION

00:53:50.093 --> 00:53:51.528
MANY TIMES PATIENTS ARE BEING

00:53:51.595 --> 00:53:52.929
SEEN BY MULTIPLE --

00:53:52.996 --> 00:53:55.065
PHYSICIANS AND SO THIS --

00:53:55.131 --> 00:53:56.333
THIS AMBIGUITY IN TERMS OF

AS ACCURATE AS PARTICULARLY AN

00:53:59.703 --> 00:54:01.237
ISSUE WHEN PATIENTS ARE THE MOST

00:54:01.304 --> 00:54:02.305
VULNERABLE WHEN THEY'RE ADMITTED

00:54:02.372 --> 00:54:03.673
TO OUR HOSPITALS.

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:04.774
AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR HIGH

00:54:04.841 --> 00:54:06.309

SO THAT THE ORDERS THAT ARE

00:54:11.982 --> 00:54:13.550
WRITTEN SUBSEQUENTLY ARE BASED

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:14.918

01:41:21.909 --> 01:41:22.876
A FEW MINUTES TO LOOK AT A

01:41:22.943 --> 01:41:23.710

01:41:38.692 --> 01:41:39.493
SO THIS TREMENDOUS

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:41.462
RESPONSIBILITIES ON PHARMACIST

01:41:41.528 --> 01:41:44.131

MANY OF THESE COMPANIES ARE --

01:41:46.166 --> 01:41:47.067
PUBLIC COMPANIES AND THEY WANT

01:41:47.134 --> 01:41:50.504
TO INCREASE DO IT UNFORTUNATELY

01:41:50.571 --> 01:41:52.539
IS THEY WILL PULL STAFF AWAY.

01:41:52.606 --> 01:41:53.740
AND WHEN PEOPLE STAFF AWAY THAT

01:41:53.807 --> 01:41:54.741
MEANS THE PHARMACISTS HAVE TO

01:41:54.808 --> 01:41:56.376
ANSWER THE PHONES IT IS A

01:41:56.443 --> 01:41:57.711
PHARMACIST DEL HAS TO GIVE THE

01:41:57.778 --> 01:41:58.712
IMMUNIZATION.

01:41:58.779 --> 01:41:59.913
A MEANS OF THE PHARMACIST US

01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:02.149
TAKE THE ORAL PRESCRIPTION OVER

01:42:02.216 --> 01:42:03.250
THE PHONE FROM A PHYSICIAN THAT

01:42:03.317 --> 01:42:04.985
CANNOT BE DONE --

01:42:05.052 --> 01:42:07.654
BY TECHNICIAN MUST BE DONE BY

01:42:07.721 --> 01:42:08.255
THE PHARMACIST AND THEN THE

01:42:08.322 --> 01:42:08.889
PHARMACISTS HAVE TO CHECK THE

01:42:08.956 --> 01:42:09.623
WORK.

01:42:09.690 --> 01:42:10.791
OF THE TECHNICIAN TO MAKE SURE

01:42:10.858 --> 01:42:11.792

IN THE BOTTLE THAT THERE'S NOT A

01:42:14.328 --> 01:42:16.029
DRUG INTERACTION WITH SOMETHING

01:42:16.096 --> 01:42:17.498
THAT MAYBE THEY'RE ALSO TAKING.

01:42:17.564 --> 01:42:18.899
AND THIS IS WHY THERE'S A

01:42:18.966 --> 01:42:20.133
CHALLENGE TODAY THERE'S A

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:21.568
REQUIREMENT UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW

01:42:21.635 --> 01:42:22.636

PHARMACIST IN CHARGE.

01:42:24.204 --> 01:42:26.373
AND MANY EXPERIENCE PHARMACISTS

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:27.808
DON'T WANT THAT JOB BECAUSE THEY

01:42:27.875 --> 01:42:30.310
SEE IT AS A DISASTER IN THE

01:42:30.377 --> 01:42:31.645
MAKING BECAUSE MISTAKES ARE

01:42:31.712 --> 01:42:32.846
GOING TO HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T

AND AND HELP WITH PHARMACISTS

01:42:36.383 --> 01:42:37.284
SHOULD NOT BE --

01:42:37.351 --> 01:42:38.852
RINGING OUT NON PHARMACEUTICAL

01:42:38.919 --> 01:42:40.320
SALES --

01:42:40.387 --> 01:42:41.488
BECAUSE THE LINES ARE ARE TOO

01:42:41.555 --> 01:42:43.557
BIG AT THE AT THE FRONT OF THE

01:42:43.624 --> 01:42:43.991
STORE.

01:42:44.057 --> 01:42:46.026
AYE AYE ONE JUST SHOW YOU ONE

01:42:46.093 --> 01:42:47.494
LITTLE PIECE OF EVIDENCE MISTER

01:42:47.561 --> 01:42:50.430
ABOUT CHAIR IF I MAY THIS IS --

01:42:50.497 --> 01:42:52.733
THE PUBLIC OR RECORDS REQUEST BY

01:42:52.799 --> 01:42:55.102
THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY JUNE

01:42:55.168 --> 01:42:56.904
FIRST TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

01:42:56.970 --> 01:42:58.539
AUGUST THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND

01:42:58.605 --> 01:43:00.908
AND SEVENTEEN THESE ARE ALL.

01:43:00.974 --> 01:43:02.743
VIOLATIONS.

01:43:02.809 --> 01:43:05.345
A CHAIN STORES.

01:43:05.412 --> 01:43:07.180
AND I WOULD ALLEGE.

01:43:07.247 --> 01:43:08.782
IN APPLYING THAT PROBABLY 80% OF

01:43:08.849 --> 01:43:10.617
THESE.

01:43:10.684 --> 01:43:11.919
ARE BECAUSE THE PHARMACIST

01:43:11.985 --> 01:43:13.353
DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME. TO DO

01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:15.689
THEIR JOBS.

01:43:15.756 --> 01:43:18.191
AND THEY WERE WRITTEN VIOLATIONS.

01:43:18.258 --> 01:43:20.193
AS WELL AS THE PHARMACY AND THEY

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:21.428
GO ON PROBATION AND MANY CASES

01:43:21.495 --> 01:43:23.530
SEE ESPECIALLY YOUNG PHARMACISTS

01:43:23.597 --> 01:43:24.164
TO COME OUT OF SCHOOL THEY SAY

01:43:24.231 --> 01:43:25.732
ELECT WILL GIVE A COUPLE BUCKS

01:43:25.799 --> 01:43:26.366
AN HOUR TO BE THE PHARMACISTS IN

01:43:26.433 --> 01:43:27.768
CHARGE.

01:43:27.834 --> 01:43:29.603
AND COMING OUT OF SCHOOL WITH

01:43:29.670 --> 01:43:31.038
HIGH DEBT SAY SURE WILL TAKE ON

01:43:31.104 --> 01:43:32.272
THAT RESPONSIBILITY NOT KNOWING

01:43:32.339 --> 01:43:33.006
THAT.

01:43:33.073 --> 01:43:33.941
WHILE THEIR HOME IN A PHARMACIST

01:43:34.007 --> 01:43:35.108
ISN'T DOING THEIR JOB AND THEY

01:43:35.175 --> 01:43:36.543
MAKE AN ERROR THAT THEY'RE

01:43:36.610 --> 01:43:38.712
RESPONSIBLE AS WELL FOR THAT.

01:43:38.779 --> 01:43:39.580
FOR THAT AIR THAT HAPPENED WHEN

01:43:39.646 --> 01:43:40.514
THEY WERE EVEN IN THE PHARMACY

01:43:40.581 --> 01:43:41.748
AND THAT'S WHY PHARMACIES ARE

01:43:41.815 --> 01:43:43.083
HAVING TROUBLE RECRUITING FOR

01:43:43.150 --> 01:43:44.585
PHARMACISTS IN CHARGE SO.

01:43:44.651 --> 01:43:45.852
YOU KNOW.

01:43:45.919 --> 01:43:47.688
AN EXTRA THIRTY SECONDS EXTRA

01:43:47.754 --> 01:43:48.789
MINUTES IS ENOUGH FOR A

01:43:48.855 --> 01:43:50.424
PHARMACIST TO BE ABLE TO CHECK

01:43:50.490 --> 01:43:51.658
THAT BOTTLE AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:43:51.725 --> 01:43:53.594
THIS MEDICATION THAT'S REQUIRED

01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:54.094
IN.

01:43:54.161 --> 01:43:55.762
DOSAGES RIGHT IN THE DIRECTIONS

01:43:55.829 --> 01:43:57.864
ARE RIGHT THE POSITION IS RIGHT.

01:43:57.931 --> 01:43:59.399
AND THERE'S NO DRUG INTERACTIONS

01:43:59.466 --> 01:44:01.001
TO VERY COMPLEX JOB WITH A LOT

01:44:01.068 --> 01:44:02.369
OF LIABILITY IF THINGS ARE DONE

01:44:02.436 --> 01:44:03.303
RIGHT.

01:44:03.370 --> 01:44:05.205
I THINK THIS IS A VERY GOOD

01:44:05.272 --> 01:44:07.040
SUGGESTION TO HAVE ONE ANCILLARY

01:44:07.107 --> 01:44:09.409
PERSONNEL --

01:44:09.476 --> 01:44:10.877

IN THE MORNING IN THE PHARMACY

01:44:15.782 --> 01:44:17.918
STAFF DOESN'T SHOW.

01:44:17.985 --> 01:44:18.952
WELL THAT MEANS OF THE FOR THE

01:44:19.019 --> 01:44:20.320
MANAGER OF THE STORE CAN TAKE

01:44:20.387 --> 01:44:22.589
ONE OF THE CASHIERS UP FRONT.

01:44:22.656 --> 01:44:23.624
THE PUT IN THE PHARMACY YOU

SOMETHING OVER THE COUNTER AT

TYPE OF CONVICTION THAT HARMS A

01:59:51.017 --> 01:59:51.918
PATIENT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN

01:59:51.984 --> 01:59:53.452
NOTIFICATION.

01:59:53.519 --> 01:59:55.321
WITH THEY WANT IS JUST FELONY

02:00:03.996 --> 02:00:04.997

THAT WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN

ANONYMOUS TELEPHONE CALLS PERSON

02:00:12.538 --> 02:00:14.206
PLAYED DOWN FROM ANNOYING OR

MOLESTING A MINOR CHILD. TO TO

02:00:17.276 --> 02:00:18.844
THAT TO ANONYMOUS TELEPHONE

02:00:18.911 --> 02:00:19.879
CALLS BECAUSE THEY RID THE

02:00:19.946 --> 02:00:21.514
DOCTOR WAS HARASSING AN UNDER

02:00:21.581 --> 02:00:23.282
AGE CHILD AND PARENT.

02:00:23.349 --> 02:00:24.817
I THINK THAT'S PATIENT HARM

02:00:24.884 --> 02:00:26.319
POSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED

02:00:26.385 --> 02:00:27.753
SUBSTANCE WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION

02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:29.322
THAT'S WHAT THE DOCTOR HAD.

02:00:29.388 --> 02:00:31.023
WELL THAT WAS PLAYED DOWN TO A

02:00:31.090 --> 02:00:32.825
MISDEMEANOR BUT THEY WERE GOING

02:00:32.892 --> 02:00:34.727
TO GIVE THEY WERE GIVING THE

02:00:34.794 --> 02:00:37.496
PATIENT THOSE SUBSTANCES THAT

02:00:37.563 --> 02:00:38.664
WERE CONTROLLED.

02:00:38.731 --> 02:00:41.033
A ASSAULT WAS PLAYED DOWN TO A

02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:42.835
MISDEMEANOR.

02:00:42.902 --> 02:00:44.403
WELL ASSAULT IT WAS ASSAULT

02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:46.339
AGAINST A PATIENT.

02:00:46.405 --> 02:00:47.740
A OF TRAINING CONTROLLED

02:00:47.807 --> 02:00:49.442
SUBSTANCES THROUGH FRAUD DECEIT

02:00:49.508 --> 02:00:51.777
OR MISREPRESENTATION.

02:00:51.844 --> 02:00:52.645
THAT WOULD BE YOU WOULDN'T THINK

02:00:52.712 --> 02:00:54.680
THERE BE PATIENT HARM BUT THAT

02:00:54.747 --> 02:00:56.015
OBTAINING THE CONTROLLED

02:00:56.082 --> 02:00:57.183
SUBSTANCES WERE GIVEN TO

02:00:57.249 --> 02:00:59.485
PATIENTS.

02:00:59.552 --> 02:01:01.287
L. USING A CONCEALED CAMCORDER

02:01:01.354 --> 02:01:02.722
TO SECRETLY VIDEOTAPE A PERSON

02:01:02.788 --> 02:01:04.223
IN A PLACE WHERE THE PERSON.

02:01:04.290 --> 02:01:06.325
HAS A REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF

02:01:06.392 --> 02:01:07.994
PRIVACY THAT WAS THE CHARGE OF

02:01:08.060 --> 02:01:09.328
AS A MISDEMEANOR.

02:01:09.395 --> 02:01:10.596
THAT WAS HARMING A PATIENT

02:01:10.663 --> 02:01:11.564
BECAUSE THEY WERE FILMING A

02:01:11.631 --> 02:01:12.798
PATIENT.

02:01:12.865 --> 02:01:14.867
IN THE ROOM PETTY IN GRAND THEFT

02:01:14.934 --> 02:01:17.403
RELATING TO HEALTH CARE.

02:01:17.470 --> 02:01:18.671
SOME SEPARATE FROM THAT BUT THEY

02:01:18.738 --> 02:01:21.374
WERE STEALING FROM A PATIENT.

02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:22.808
SO THAT'S WHY WE FELT THAT IT'S

02:01:22.875 --> 02:01:24.877
IMPORTANT REGARDLESS OF FELONY

02:01:24.944 --> 02:01:26.078
OR MISDEMEANOR.

02:01:26.145 --> 02:01:27.947
ALL CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT SHOWS

02:01:28.014 --> 02:01:30.282
IT INDICATES A HARM TO PATIENTS

02:01:30.349 --> 02:01:32.051
I UNDERSTAND AND I AM I AGREE

02:01:32.118 --> 02:01:33.019
WITH YOU THERE --

02:01:33.085 --> 02:01:34.387
THERE ARE SO MANY MISDEMEANORS

02:01:34.453 --> 02:01:35.888
THAT ARE --

02:01:35.955 --> 02:01:37.890
ONES THAT I THINK PATIENTS WOULD

02:01:37.957 --> 02:01:39.225
WANT TO KNOW ABOUT.

02:01:39.291 --> 02:01:40.726
AND ONE IS THAT IF YOU'RE A

02:01:40.793 --> 02:01:42.395
MANDATED REPORTER AND YOU KNEW

02:01:42.461 --> 02:01:44.397
ABOUT THE CSUS ARE YOU SUSPECTED

02:01:44.463 --> 02:01:46.132
POTENTIAL ABUSE OF SOMEONE

02:01:46.198 --> 02:01:48.768
YOU'RE MANDATED TO TELL --

02:01:48.834 --> 02:01:50.202
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IF YOU DON'T

02:01:50.269 --> 02:01:52.638
IT'S A MISDEMEANOR AND A FINE OF

02:01:52.705 --> 02:01:53.372
THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT THAT'S

02:01:53.439 --> 02:01:54.707
SOMETHING THAT IS VERY PERTINENT

02:01:54.774 --> 02:01:56.175
TO THE LARRY NASSER CASON.

02:01:56.242 --> 02:01:59.345
AND OTHER CASES --

02:01:59.412 --> 02:02:00.746
IN AYE I'M IS SUPPORT THIS AND

02:02:00.813 --> 02:02:01.580
AND I THINK ONE OF THINGS I'M

02:02:01.647 --> 02:02:04.083
REALLY PLEASED TO SEE IS THAT.

02:02:04.150 --> 02:02:05.551
YOU HAVE MADE IT A MUCH MORE

02:02:05.618 --> 02:02:07.119
NARROW PROVISION THAT WHAT PRIOR

02:02:07.186 --> 02:02:09.188
EFFORTS TO DISCLOSE TO PATIENTS

02:02:09.255 --> 02:02:10.756
PROBATION STATUS HAVE BEEN.

02:02:10.823 --> 02:02:13.125
NOT ONLY SUBJECT MATTER LIKE

02:02:13.192 --> 02:02:14.694
POTENTIAL OF WE WHICH ARE

02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:16.128
PRACTICES AND POTENTIAL PATIENT

OF ALL RESIDENTIAL RENTAL UNITS

02:17:21.733 --> 02:17:23.368

02:17:23.435 --> 02:17:25.437
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CONDOMINIUM

02:18:08.313 --> 02:18:10.015
THEIR SECOND.

02:18:10.081 --> 02:18:12.283
THIS IS A VERY VERY BIG ISSUE

02:18:12.350 --> 02:18:14.152
THE BILL SAYS THE INSPECTION IS

02:18:14.219 --> 02:18:16.955
TO BE DONE ON 15% OF UNIT.

02:18:17.022 --> 02:18:18.857
I GUESS TO BE INSPECTED --

02:18:18.923 --> 02:18:19.891
OR TO BE DETERMINED BY THE

02:18:19.958 --> 02:18:22.394
INSPECTOR.

02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:25.930
AND OF THE 15% BUT WHEN THE

02:18:25.997 --> 02:18:28.900
INSPECTOR IS LOOKING AT THE DARK

02:18:28.967 --> 02:18:30.635

EDUCATION WILL.

02:18:39.444 --> 02:18:42.047
WILL SAY THIS IS GOING TO BE AN

02:18:42.113 --> 02:18:43.615
THE REPORT BECAUSE THAT.

02:18:43.682 --> 02:18:47.118
SPECTOR'S GOT TO KNOW HOW THE

02:18:47.185 --> 02:18:49.254
DECKED THE BALCONY THE PORCH IS

02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:52.590
ATTACHED TO THE WALL IS IT SAFE

02:18:52.657 --> 02:18:54.325

02:18:59.264 --> 02:19:00.932
WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

02:19:00.999 --> 02:19:04.903
INVASIVE NATURE OF V. INSPECTION

02:19:04.969 --> 02:19:07.906
IN THE INSPECTIONS WILL CALL FOR

02:19:07.972 --> 02:19:09.774

02:19:09.841 --> 02:19:12.010

02:19:12.077 --> 02:19:13.712
DESTRUCTIVE TECHNIQUES.

02:19:13.778 --> 02:19:15.714
I TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION WE

02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:17.582
BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE ONLY

02:19:17.649 --> 02:19:21.886
BASED ON EVIDENCE ON THE OUTSIDE

02:19:21.953 --> 02:19:23.955
THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG.

02:19:24.022 --> 02:19:26.925
ON THE INSIDE OF THE WALL.

02:19:26.991 --> 02:19:28.193

THERE'S ALWAYS A RIGHT TO APPEAL

02:19:49.948 --> 02:19:51.382
BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T --

02:19:51.449 --> 02:19:53.485
ADDRESS IT AS YET [inaudible]

02:19:53.551 --> 02:19:57.655
NEXT -- WE

02:19:57.722 --> 02:20:00.658
HAVE TO DISCLOSE EVERY

BUT WHAT REALLY SHOULD HAPPEN.

02:20:12.103 --> 02:20:14.539
IS THAT IT SHOULD BE FOR ONE

02:20:14.606 --> 02:20:16.674
