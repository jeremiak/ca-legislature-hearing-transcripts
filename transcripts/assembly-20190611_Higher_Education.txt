IT HAS BEEN MORE THAN A DECADE SINCE CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE BEEN ASKED TO DEDICATE FUNDS TO BUILD AND REPAIR HIGHER EDUCATION CLASSROOMS RESEARCH LABS. AND LIBRARIES ACROSS OUR STATE. AND NO HIGHER EDUCATION SPECIFIC BOND HAS PASSED SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY TWO ALL THE BOND DOLLARS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE LAST RECEIVED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX HAVE DRIED UP. PROJECTS ARE BEING SIDELINED AS THE CSU AND YOU SEE ARE SCRAMBLING TO MAINTAIN OLD BUILDINGS. AND FACILITIES. TO ADDRESS TO ADDRESS SHORTAGES AND KEEP PACE WITH TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES BOTH SYSTEMS WILL SOON NEED MORE CLASSROOMS LABS AND OTHER FACILITIES TO MEET. STUDENT NEEDS. THE BOND MONEY IN THE BILL COULD ALSO BE USED FOR CONSTRUCTION RECONSTRUCTION EARTHQUAKE. RETROFITTING AND REMODELING OF EXISTING OR NEW FACILITIES. ACCORDING TO BOTH SYSTEMS I KNOW WE'LL HEAR FROM THEM IN JUST A MOMENT THEY HAVE COMBINED CAPITAL NEEDS OF SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. FOR SHORT AND LONG TERM PROJECTS. WE ALL KNOW HOW VITAL OUR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS ARE TO OUR ECONOMY AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT STUDENTS NEED TO BE EQUIPPED WITH THE CLASSROOMS LIBRARIES SLAPS THAT WILL PREPARE THEM.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH CARE AND FIGURED ISSUE A STANDARD I WAS -- BUT NOT FOR THE SPONSORS AND OR YOURSELVES THE THE CONVERSATION WITH RESPECT TO THE THE SPLIT EVENLY OF THE RESOURCES. AND YET THAT OF THE CAMPUSES IN THE NIGHT OF STUDENTS THAT THIS ISSUES POTENTIALLY HAD WAS THERE ANY CONVERSATION I THOUGHT BEHIND THAT. OF THE EVEN DISTRIBUTION OFTHAT OF THE FIFTY FIFTY SPECIFICALLY. THROUGH THEIR PLEASE AND THANK YOU CENTER THANK YOU SALLY MEMBER LOVE FOR THE QUESTION. YOU KNOW THIS IS A COMMON QUESTION ASKED THAT WHEN THESE KINDS OF THINGS ARE PUT FORWARD AND I THINK THAT. MY FEELING HAS BEEN THAT THEY BOTH HAVE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS THAT WON'T EVEN BE MATCHED BY IT BY THIS MEASURE -- AND THAT -- I IN THE SPIRIT OF THE GREAT COALITION THE THAT'S BEEN PUT TOGETHER BEHIND THIS I THINK THE EVE EVEN SPLIT IS I THINK SOMETHING THAT BOTH SYSTEMS ARE COMFORTABLE WITH. AND I CERTAINLY AM AND THAT'S WHY IT'S PRESENTED THE WAY IT IS TODAY. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU CHAIR. AS A FORMER RON. UNIVERSITY FACULTY MEMBER HI -- HIGHLY -- AM INTERESTED IN -- SUPPORTING ANY MEASURE SO BUT THE I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS REGARDING -- THIS MEASURE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS TO IT YOU'LL BOND THIS IS. A HUGE AMOUNT OF OUR ADDITIONAL TAX BURDEN. WE NEED TO CREATE THE A RELATED TO THAT I WONDER. OF FIRST OF FOR THROUGH THE OUR ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHMENT. OF THE BUILDING WHEN THEY ARE BUILT -- TO WHAT THEY JUST A BILL THAN THE NORM MAINTENANCE COSTS SO. MANAGERS ABILITY IN IN THE CHEN ARE BUDGET THAT THE UC'S WAS CSU RECEIVER. WITH THE UNIT TO A SET ASIDE -- BUILDING -- MAINTENANCE COSTA SEPARATELY SL ONE QUESTION. NUMBER TWO IS -- HOW LONG? WITH THE SEC EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AT THAT TO RECREATE THAT THAT WILL. MAINTAIN IS A CARIBBEAN NEXT A FIFTY YEARS OR IN PERPETUITY OR JUST A TEN YEARS [inaudible] O'DONNELL [inaudible] AND AND THE QUESTION IS THAT -- CALIFORNIA HAS SOME. EXTRA ORDINARY MONO OF SURPLUS RIGHT NOW I CAN'T EXACTLY REMEMBER TO MY MEMORY ELECT THE TWENTY ONE P. AND DAUGHTERS -- WHY CAN WE SEE YOU -- SELL US SOME OF THAT THE MONEY ONE TIME MONEY THAT WITHOUT COSTING ANY ADDITIONAL TAX BURDEN OF BURDEN ON THE CITIZENS -- THOSE ARE THE DUTCH GENERAL QUESTIONS SO I COME TO REALIZE SO -- BEFORE A WEEK COSTA DISCOUNT ABOUT TEN ARCHITECT. OKAY WELL LET ME TRY TO GIVE IT A SHOT AND MY COLLEAGUES HERE MAY. WANT TO ENHANCE MY ANSWERS. I THINK PART OF THE REASON WE HAD THE VINES IS IT SIGNIFICANT TODAY IS BECAUSE THAT WE FALL OUT IT TO DETERIORATE WITHOUT REALLY RESPONSE OVER MANY MANY DECADES. AND SO THEY'RE THERE FOR THE THINGS GET OLDER AND WE HAVE TO FIND SOME WAY TO CATCH UP AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THE THE BONDS PROPOSED AS IT IS SET BEFORE YOU -- THERE THERE IS MAKING HIS MONEY THAT IS PROVIDED TO MAINTAIN THESE FACILITIES OVER THE YEARS BUT THAT'S BEEN SUBJECT TO THE BUDGET PROCESS THAT WE ALL PARTICIPATE. SO FOR EXAMPLE THE BUDGET THAT WE WILL BE POTENTIALLY VOTING ON THIS WEEK. DOES PROVIDE AFFABLE SYSTEMS SIGNIFICANT MAINTENANCE MONEY TO TRY TO KEEP THOSE FACILITIES RUNNING. AND USABLE. AND THAT OF COURSE IS SUBJECT EVERY YEAR TO THE BUDGET PROCESS. THIS ATTEMPT TO DEAL WITH MORE THE THE CAPITAL NEEDS THAT ARE OUT THERE -- HAS THE LABS AND CLASSROOMS OF DETERIORATED SAID THEY'RE NOT USABLE -- AND IN MANY WAYS. THIS IS ABOUT PAYING IT FORWARD JUST LIKE OUR PARENTS PAID IT FORWARD FOR THE FACILITIES THAT WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OVER. MANY YEARS -- IN THE PAST. AND SO IT HAS A LIFE A LIFE FLOOD OF FOR THESE NEW FACILITIES OR THE THE RECONSTRUCTION IS THE XISTING FACILITIES OF ANOTHER OF DECADES INTO THE FUTURE. SO THE THE BONDS WILL BE PAID OFF -- OVER THIRTY FORTY YEARS THE FACILITIES THAT WILL BE PROVIDED IN THIS MEASURE WILL BE THERE FOR THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS. AND SO IT IS TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH. THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T MAINTAIN THOSE FACILITIES AS AS WE WOULD LIKE. TO AND THE CHANGING REQUIREMENTS OF OUR OUR ECONOMY AND OUR EDUCATION WORLD TODAY. THAT WE CAN PAY IT FORWARD -- FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF STUDENTS SO THAT BE MY MULTI PRONGED ANSWER TIER THREE QUESTIONS. HAVE YOU ATTEMPTED -- TO OF GOVERNANCE BUDGET BUT THAT THEY CAN USE THAT THE AN EXTRA MONEY THE US. WELL HE HAS IS PROVIDING SOME MAINTENANCE MONEY I IN THE BUDGET. BUT YOU KNOW PRIOR TO THIS BOND THAT THE OBLIGATION AT LEAST AT THE LAST GOVERNOR. SERVE FOR EIGHT YEARS WAS TO PUT THAT -- REQUIREMENT ON TO THE SYSTEMS THEMSELVES. AND BY DOING SO IT MEANT THAT THE THAT THE OBLIGATION FOR THAT CAPITAL. HAD AT AT HAD A AS A POSSIBILITY THAT WOULD WOULD BE -- FUNDED BY TWO WHICH SHOULD. TUITION INCREASES THAT NONE OF US HERE LIKE -- BUT THAT THAT WAS THE A REVENUE SOURCE FOR ANY CAPITAL OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS -- AT THE SYSTEMS WITH EITHER EXISTING REVENUE OR OR OTHER MONEY THAT -- COULD COME IN THE FORM OF TUITION. AND I THINK THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE THINK -- IS THE PRUDENT COURSE THE THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM WERE BUILT BY THE ALL THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA WE ALL SUPPORTED THOSE. HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WE SET UP THE STUDENTS THAT GO ON THEIR FAMILIES HAVE THAT OBLIGATION SO WE HAVE ALL PAID COLLECTIVELY. AND THAT'S WHAT BONDS DO IS THEY COLLECTIVELY ALL SHARE IN THOSE COSTS OVER TIME OVER MANY MANY DECADES NOT JUST FUNDED IN ONE SIMPLE. A BUDGET -- THAT HAS AT SOME SURPLUS MONEY AVAILABLE FOR THAT CAP OF ONE TIME COSTS THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU A LONG TERM FUNDING MECHANISM -- THAT HAS GRADUAL STATE FIND COSTS RATHER THAN A ONE TIME WHICH COME AND GO. IF I DON'T QUESTION THAT THIS EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS SO A GEO BONTA HOW LONG LAW OR THIS MAINTAINED -- A TOTAL OF A TOP SHAPE OF THE BUILDING THAT CURRENTLY YOU AYE ENVISIONING TO MAINTAIN. I DON'T WANT TO MISLEAD YOU TO SAY THAT THE SAN HOUSE GOING TO SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS FOR BOTH SYSTEMS -- IT DOESN'T THAT NEEDS ARE EVEN GREATER AND THESE ARE THESE ARE CHOICES THAT THEY WILL MAKE IN TERMS OF HOW THEY SPEND THAT MONEY THEY'LL GO THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS. A PUBLIC HEARING PROCESS WITH HIM PUT FROM ALL STAKEHOLDERS. I THOUGHT THAT ALLOW THE REGIONS IN THE TRUSTEES TO MAKE THOUGHTFUL CHOICES ABOUT WHERE THOSE EXPENDITURES WILL OCCUR EACH YEAR. IN THEIR FIVE YEAR CAPITAL PLAN AND AS THINGS MOVE FORWARD AS YOU KNOW THESE THINGS DON'T HAPPEN. OVERNIGHT SO THERE IS A PROCESS THAT THEY'LL GO THROUGH TO MAKE THESE CHOICES ABOUT HOW IS IT. IS IT EARTHQUAKE RETROFITTING IS IT A NEW A LABORATORY THAT STOPPING KIDS FROM GETTING SCIENCE DEGREES THEY'LL MAKE THESE THOUGHTFUL CHOICES. I IN A DELIBERATE OF WAY IT'S NOT PRESCRIPTIVE IN THE BILL THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. DR ROMA. THANK YOU SENATOR I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY AND MOVE THIS BILL MISTER CHAIR WHILE I DON'T HAVE A CSU OR YOU SEE AND MY DISTRICT I DO HAVE A CITY COLLEGE WHICH I'M QUITE PROUD OF AN ANSWER FOR CITY COLLEGE. BUT I'M SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE I TOOK A TOUR WITH OUR CSU PRESIDENT AT FRESNO STATE. AND I SAW THEIR CENTRAL CORE POWER PLANT AND THE COMPUTER THAT OPERATED IT. STILL HAS AN OPERATING SYSTEM AND HAD A FLOPPY DISK DRIVE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO. KNOW ABOUT THAT AND THEY HAD TO FIND A LOT OF THEIR REPLACEMENTS ON EBAY BECAUSE THE PRODUCER NO LONGER IS IN SUPPLY THAT'S HOW LONG OUR FACILITIES HAVE NEEDED THIS UPGRADE AND WHY I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS. TODAY IT'S IMPERATIVE FOR OUR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS TO BE REINVESTED IN AND WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS. THANK YOU AND AND AND AND PRESIDENT CASTRO WAS A VERY ARTICULATE ADVOCATE FOR FRESNO STATE AND I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT SENATOR BOARD JUST. HAS JOINED IN DIE AND CO AUTHOR IN THIS LEGISLATION FOR THAT VERY REASON THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR GABER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU SENATOR FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP PROUD TO BE A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF THIS PROJECT. YOU'VE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB HERE I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BILLS WE HAVE A FOR THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR AND JUST WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. AND WOOD -- SECOND THE BILL. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I ALSO WANT TO THANK -- THE AUTHOR FOR BRING IN THIS MEASURE FORWARD AND I'M ALSO THANKFUL TO BE A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR THANK YOU. AS I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT A MANY OF THE CAMPUSES I INCLUDING SACKS STATE WHERE I SAW JUST THE VERY THING THAT YOU MENTIONED -- LABORATORY THAT IS A BOTTLENECK FOR STUDENTS A LABORATORY THAT SOLD -- THAT IT CAN'T OF THE COMEDY OF THE STUDENTS WHO NEED THAT SCIENCE CLASS IN THAT SCIENCE LAB. IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR DEGREES -- IT ALSO UC RIVERSIDE THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT AS IT BEGINS TO GROW IT AS IT BEGINS TO ACCOMMODATE MORE AND MORE STUDENTS. I HEAR STORIES OF STUDENTS SITTING ON THE FLOOR OF NOT BEING ENOUGH -- DEATHS. OF NOT BEING NOT ENOUGH OFFICE SPACE OF FOR NEW FACULTY. SO FOR FOR ALL THOSE REASONS -- I THINK VERY MUCH THIS IS. FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND SENATOR IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND CO SPONSORSHIP OF THIS MEASURE AND I'M I'M VERY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT. IT'S A BIPARTISAN BILL BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING IN OUR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS OUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS DID THAT FOR US IN THE KIDS OF TODAY WE NEED TO DO THAT FOR THE FUTURE. AND I THINK THIS BILL OUT WILL ALLOW THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA HOPEFULLY TO MAKE A GOOD CHOICE WITH THAT I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION. AND MADAM SECRETARY READ PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEDINA. MEDINA I CHOI. CHOICE I ARAMBULA. ARAMBULA I BLOOM. BLOOM I GABRIEL. GABRIEL I IRWIN -- WHEN I KILEY? KILEY NOT VOTING LEVINE LEVINE I LOW. LOW I PATTERSON [inaudible] SANTIAGO WEBER [inaudible] WEBER HI. THE BILL IS A NINE ZERO THAT BILL IS OUT WE WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS AND THEN WE WILL GO TO FILE ITEM. TO SB. ONE FORTY EIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. SB ONE FORTY EIGHT WOULD CREATE INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE UNDERSERVED STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM. THAT PROMISE PROGRAM WENT INTO EFFECT IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN HE GAVE STUDENTS WHO WANT TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS THE TOOLS TO DO SO. SO FAR NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS HAVE PARTICIPATED -- THE PREVIOUS BILL ALSO REQUIRED THE STATE UNIVERSITIES TO SUBMIT A REPORT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS ON POTENTIAL INCENTIVES THAT ARE CUTTING. ENCOURAGE STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN THE PROMISE PROGRAM -- IN THAT REPORT THE STATE UNIVERSITIES NOTED QUOTE EFFECTIVE INCENTIVES COULD ENCOURAGE MORE STUDENTS TO KEEP PACE WITH THEIR COMMITMENTS. AND COULD SERVE AS A MEANS TO ATTRACT MORE STUDENTS TO COMMIT TO THESE PROGRAMS AT THE ONSET. OF THEIR ACADEMIC CAREER. FIND QUOTE SO BUILDING UPON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE BILL IS THAT BEFORE YOU -- IT WOULD ESTABLISH THE STUDENT SUCCESS IN ON TIME COMPLETION FIND BUT ALLOW MONEY APPROPRIATED TO THIS FUND BY THE LEGISLATURE TO BE USED FOR SUMMER GRANTS. ON TRACK PROGRESS GRANTS. AND STARTING ON JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY PROVIDE BACK IN TUITION WAIVERS FOR ALL REMAINING CLASSES NEEDED TO GRADUATE WHEN A CAMPUS IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE A PATHWAY TO GRADUATE. IN FOUR OR TWO YEARS. IN PARTICULAR THIS BILL PROVIDES INCENTIVES TO STUDENTS IN NEED TO REQUIREMENT UNDER THE BILL THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU TODAY. AND THEY ARE CONTINGENT UPON AN APPROPRIATION BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND FINALLY THE CSU WOULD BE ALLOWED TO CHOOSE WHICH AND SENATOR USED AT EACH INDIVIDUAL CAMPUS PROGRAM. AND THE MONEY -- THE BILL SPECIFIES THAT MONEY IN THIS NEW FUND MAY BE USED BY THE TRUSTEES TO CREATE THE INCENTIVES NOTHING REQUIRES THE TRUSTEES TO DO THIS. I RESPECTFULLY. REQUEST AN AYE VOTE TODAY AND WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. IS HANNAH BRAG STAT. OF REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION SECOND. A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEDINA MEMBERS MY NAME IS HANNAH BACK START WITH THE CAL STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION WE ARE THANKFUL FOR SENATOR GLAZER FOR THE WORK HE'S DONE ON SB. ONE FOUR EIGHT THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM. FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN SENATOR GLAZER BROUGHT THE CALIFORNIA PROMISED BUILT OUR BOARD CSSA OPPOSE THE BILL AT THE TIME WE FELT LIKE THE TUITION FREEZE AS WELL AS THE IDEA THE ONLY PRIVILEGE STUDENTS COULD ACCESS THE PROGRAM. DID NOT HAVE STUDENT EQUITY AT THE HEART OF THE PROGRAM MAKING OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO ONLY THOSE STUDENTS WITH THE FINANCIAL ABILITY TO TAKE THEM IS NOT AN ACQUITTAL EQUITABLE SOLUTION TO US. MANY STUDENTS HAVE TO WORK MULTIPLE JOBS TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES AND MANY TIMES THEIR FAMILIES. AND AS AN ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS CSU STUDENTS WITH SUCH A HIGH LEVEL OF POWERS THAT BEYONCE FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS AN UNDER REPRESENTED POPULATIONS EQUITY IS AN APP SALUTE PRIORITY FOR US. IT'S AN ARE VERY MISSION AS AN ORGANIZATION THIS IS WHY WE ARE SO APPRECIATIVE OF THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE ON SB ONE FOUR EIGHT BY SENATOR GLAZER AND HIS STAFF TO COME UP WITH INCENTIVES TO ENABLE ALL STUDENTS A GOOD FAITH OPPORTUNITY. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE PROGRAMS WITH THE ADDED INCENTIVES SUMMER TERM GRANTS ON TRUCK PROPER PROGRESS GRANTS TO OFFSET NON TUITION COSTS AND NO TUITION CHARGE FOR STUDENTS WHO TAKE LONGER THAN FOUR YEARS DUE TO INSTITUTIONAL FAULT. THE BILL NOW ADDRESSES MANY OF OUR CONCERNS REGARDING EQUITY. GOING TO COLLEGE HAS A NUMBER OF BENEFITS FOR STUDENTS PARTICULARLY IN THE CAL STATE STUDENT SYSTEM. THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR UPWARD SOCIAL MOBILITY IS CHIEF AMONG THEM THIS PERSPECTIVE IS SUPPORTED BY RESEARCH THAT I SHOWN MANY CAL STATE. CAMPUSES ARE THE NATIONAL LEADERS ON ENABLING UPWARD SOCIAL MOBILITY CAL STATE LA AS THE NUMBER ONE INSTITUTION TO DO THIS. BUT THIS BENEFIT IS NEVER REALIZED AND STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY WORSE OFF IF THEY CANNOT GRADUATE. IF THE STATE CREATES PROGRAMS THAT HELP STUDENTS GRADUATE QUICKER EVEN SMALLER SUBSET STUDENTS THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON ALL STUDENTS. SIMPLY PUT GRADUATING STUDENTS QUICKER OPENS UP COURSE BASED ACROSS THE BOARD AS WELL AS ENROLLMENT SLOTS SB ONE FOUR EIGHT SIX DO YOU JUSTICE NOW WITH THE INCENTIVES INCLUDED NOT ONLY WILL THE BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM BE SEEN BY ALL STUDENTS IN THE SYSTEM. BUT NOW THE OPPORTUNITY TO PERSONALLY PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM IS OPEN TO ALL STUDENTS WE THANK THE SENATOR FOR HIS WORK ON THIS AND DRIVE VOTE TODAY. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MANY RODRIGUEZ ON BEHALF OF THE EDUCATION TRUST WESTON SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SCENE NINE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MR GABLE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO CENTER I JUST -- WANNA MAKE SURE UNDERSTAND OUR WEEK. NARROWING THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM. UNDER THE BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN IT WOULD DO THAT YES OKAY AND WHAT I'M JUST CAN YOU SPELL THAT OUT A LITTLE BIT TO SORT OF WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE IN THE RATIONALE FOR NARROWING IT. WELL THE THE RATIONALE WOULD ONLY BE IN THE EYE OF THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE CHAIR -- PLACE THIS AMENDMENT IN THE BILL -- BUT IT DOES LIMIT THE ELIGIBILITY -- AND THAT WILL AFFECT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO WILL CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROMISE PROGRAM GOING FORWARD UNDER THE BILL AS WRITTEN TODAY OKAY AND YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT THE NUMBER WHAT WHAT THAT BEING IN THE NUMBER STUDENTS THAT. PREVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE FOR COLLEGE PROMISE AND NOW WILL NO LONGER BE ELIGIBLE FOR IT -- UNDER THAT THAT NUMBERS THAT I'VE GOTTEN OF THE EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS THAT HAVE -- ARE PARTICIPATING TODAY IN THE PROGRAM -- THAT APPROXIMATELY -- 40% GOING FORWARD IF THE PROGRAM HAD BEEN. UNDER THOSE TERMS HAVE BEEN CREATED. TWO YEARS AGO WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN IT THAT TODAY -- SO THERE THAT THAT THAT THAT AND THAT IS OBVIOUSLY A POINT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT. OKAY I WELL I AND I APPRECIATE THE CANTOR HADN'T REALIZED THAT THAT HAD BEEN THE TRAJECTORY THE LEGISLATION I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT AND INTENT OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE I GUESS I YOU KNOW IN A I I THINK I PROBABLY AGREE WITH YOU. THAT IN A IN A IN A PERFECT WORLD IT WOULD BE NICE FOR THIS PROGRAM TO BE FOR ALL FOR ALL STUDENTS AT AT CSU TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY EXCESSES PROGRAM. I AGREE THANK YOU. SEE NOOTHER QUESTIONS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE CENTER THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THIS ISSUE OF GRADUATION RATES HAS BEEN. A PASSION OF MINE SINCE I WAS A PUT ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND THEN OUT AND AND AND SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE. I WE HAS SO MANY GREAT CAMPUS LEADERS AND GREAT FACULTY WHO DOING SUCH GREAT WORK FOR OUR STUDENTS BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATES IT'S IT'S A POINT OF GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT OF ALL OF US CURRENTLY IT IT'S ABOUT 4424%. FOR THE THE STATE UNIVERSITIES AND THE SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE HOVERS A LITTLE UNDER 60% NOW THE LEADERSHIP OF THE SYSTEM RECOGNIZES THE PROBLEM AND THEY'VE SET SOME VERY AMBITIOUS GOALS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE US TO ACHIEVE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO GET 240%. OFF FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATE WITH NO DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN UNDER REPRESENTED AT THE STUDENTS THAT I THINK THAT IS EXCELLENT AND THAT'S GREAT LEADERSHIP. IT REQUIRES A PARTNERSHIP ALL OF US TOGETHER IN THE BUDGET PROCESS IN THAT IN THE POLICY CHOICES THAT WE'RE MAKING HERE TODAY -- BUT IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE CAN DO TO NOT JUST PROVIDE -- ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY AND QUALITY BUT STUDENT COMPLETION IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT FOURTH LEG TO THE CHAIR WE'RE NOT DOING OUR WORK WELL AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL FOCUSES ON AND I KNOW MANY PEOPLE AROUND THAT. DAY AS HERE IS HAVE THAT JOIN ME IN TRYING TO GET THAT ATTENTION TOOK STUDENT COMPLETION AT MONTH EVERYTHING ELSE IS EQUAL. AND AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO ADVANCE TODAY AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION. WE HAD A FIRST BY MR GABRIEL. SECOND BY [inaudible] MR LOW. AND A THIRD THAT LITTLE.

RATE LAST YEAR THE COMMITTEE PASSED SB. THREE FORTY SIX AND THOUGH WE DID RAISE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE TUITION FREEZE AND OUR STUDENTS QUALIFIED FOR AID.

THAT MEET THE A. B. FIVE FORTY REQUIREMENTS. UP THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PAST OF THIS TO BE COMMENDED FOR ITS WORK ON SB TWELVE TEN WHICH CREATED. THE CALIFORNIA DREAM LOAN PROGRAM TO PROVIDE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS A RESOURCE TO FUND THEIR UNDERGRADUATE. EDUCATION I WOULD LIKE FOR US TO CONTINUE THIS PROGRESS AND ALLOW YOU. AND CSU TO USE EXISTING DREAM LOAN FUNDS. TO OFFER LOANS FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS THE ALSO MEET AB FIVE FORTY REQUIREMENTS. IF THIS BILL IS PASSED IT IS ESTIMATED THAT FIVE HUNDRED GRADUATE STUDENTS IN THE UC AND CSU COMBINED WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM. THIS BILL HAS THE SUPPORT OF BOTH THE UC AND CSU SEGMENTS AS WELL AS SUPPORT. FOR BENNY STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. I HOPE TODAY WE CAN HAVE ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT AS WELL. AND MOVE OUR STATE CLOSER TOWARDS ENSURING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACADEMIC SUCCESS -- AND TODAY IS A WITNESS I'D LIKE TO PRESENT CHRISTOPHER SANCHEZ THE POLICY ADVOCATE. FOR THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. CHRIS FOR SIGNS OF A TRAILER THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS AND ALSO REPRESENTING OUR YOUTH ORGANIZATION THE CALIFORNIA JIM NETWORK -- PROUD TO BE SPONSORS THIS MEASURE -- THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS WHY THIS BILL CAME OF TO TO LIE ONE IS A FROM DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR MEMBERS A LOT OF THEM WERE SAYING AFTER WENT ONCE THEY ATTENDED GRADUATE SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY HAVE ENTERED INTO AN EDUCATIONAL PATHWAY. TOWARDS A PROGRAM THAT REQUIRE THEM TO GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL FOR NOT TO BE DOLLARS AND SOME OF THE UNIVERSITY GRANTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE TO THEM BECAUSE THEY FOCUSED ON UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. ONCE THE STUDENTS WOULD SEEK OUT LOANS MOST THE TIME THERE WOULD BE BARRED OUT OF TRADITIONAL STUDENT LOANS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF STATUS AND WOOD. OM ONLY HAVE THE OPTION OF OBTAINING HIGH INTEREST RATE LOANS WHICH WOULD TYPICALLY BRING THEM TO TRIPLE DIGIT INTEREST RATES. ARE THEREFORE -- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A VERY LOW COST AFFORDABLE ALL ALONE FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN ON EDUCATIONAL PATHWAYS TOWARDS GRADUATE EDUCATION WHICH IS A LOAN THAT THEY WOULD REPAY. ON ONCE THEY COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

THE CSU AND YOU SEE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS WITH ACCURATE ESTIMATES FOR THE COST OF ATTENDING THEIR SCHOOLS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED ASSEMBLY BILL NINE NINETY AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ WHICH NOW REQUIRES THE C. ISSUE WHEN YOU SEE THE POST ON THEIR INTERNET WEBSITES. THE ESTIMATED MARKET COST OF AN OFF CAMPUS ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. WELL THIS WAS A GOOD FIRST STEP PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS COULD BENEFIT MORE FROM COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION ON THE EXPENSES THEY WILL FACE. WHEN THEY IN RURAL? SENATE BILL FOUR SIXTY SEVEN REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND REQUESTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. TO PLACE ON THEIR WEBSITES THE COMPREHENSIVE COST OF ATTENDANCE INCLUDING THE CURRENT COST OF AN OFF CAMPUS TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT. IN A SINGLE BEDROOM IN A PRIVATE HOME FOR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS THIS BILL EMPOWERS PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS TO MAKE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS. WHEN REVIEWING A PERSPECTIVE SEE ISSUE OR YOU SEE? MEMBERS I'D ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR I HAVE. TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TODAY SHAUNA LYNCH OF CAL STATE UNIVERSITY CAL POLY. IN SAN LUIS OBISPO AND BRETT RAFFISH ALSO COMPANY STATE UNIVERSITY CAL POLY. THANK YOU. LOOK AT THE SECOND. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN INDIANA AN HONORABLE MEMBERS FOR HAVING US TODAY WE APPRECIATE SENATOR MINING INVITING US TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL. MY NAME IS SHANE A LYNCH AND I'M A SECOND YEAR POLITICAL SCIENCE STUDENT AT CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO ORIGINALLY FROM SAN JOSE AND I'M SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF SP. FOUR SIXTY SEVEN THIS YEAR I SERVICE THE STUDENT REPRESENTATIVE ON OUR UNIVERSITIES BASIC NEEDS TASK FORCE. AND THIS COMMITTEE WE WORK TO PROVIDE HELP TO THE 27% OF CAL POLY STUDENTS WHO EXPERIENCED FOOD INSECURITY AND 12% WHO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS. CSU AND YOU SEE DATA ACROSS THE BOARD SHOWS 42% FOOD AND SECURITY AMONG STUDENTS WHICH INDICATES THAT COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE AFFECTED THREE TIMES AS MUCH AS NON SOON HOUSEHOLDS. HOMELESSNESS ON THE OTHER HAND AFFECTS ABOUT 13% OF STUDENTS BUT HAS BEEN REPORTED AS HIGH AS COLLEGE DISTRICT. WELL THERE ARE TYPICALLY ALREADY UNIVERSITY COMMITTEES THAT WORK TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE STUDENTS NEED TO BE INFORMED OF COLLEGE COSTS. THANK COMPASS MORE OF WHAT THEY EXPERIENCE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THEIR EQUIPPED WITH THE TOOLS TO PLAN FOR THE FINANCIAL BURDENS OF COLLEGE ACCORDINGLY. THE ADDRESSING THE ISSUE AT HAND THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE EDUCATION CODE WILL HELP CHRIS PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH THESE MORE TRANSPARENT COLLEGE COST ESTIMATES. REQUESTING FOR CS USE AN UC'S TO INCLUDE THE SAME BREAKDOWN OF PRICES. THE BILL ENSURES THAT STUDENTS HAVE A STANDARDIZED FIGURE TO COMPARE WHEN CHOOSING BETWEEN COLLEGES. SB FOUR SIXTY SEVEN EXPANDS ON CURRENT CODE BY PROVIDING ESTIMATES THAT ARE ENCOMPASSING OVERVIEW THAT'S APPLICABLE TO WHAT SEEMS TYPICALLY EXPERIENCE.
