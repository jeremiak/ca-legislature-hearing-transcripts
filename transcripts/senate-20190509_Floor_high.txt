SENATOR LABOR THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT GOOD MORNING MEMBERS FOR MANY YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS MADE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO EXPAND AND PROTECT. QUALITY FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES BUT RECENT CHANGES IN THE FEDERAL POLICIES JEOPARDIZE ACCESS TO THOSE CRITICAL SERVICES. PART OF THAT COMMITMENT IS FAMILY PACKED WHICH IS A MEDICAID PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. FAMILY BACK SERVICES INCLUDE ALL FDA APPROVED CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS METHODS ARE MERGING SEE CONTRACEPTIVES TESTING AND TREATMENT OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AND URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS ALONG WITH SCREENING FOR BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER. CURRENTLY FAMILY PACK IS FUNDED BY A NINETY TEN FEDERAL MATCH MEANING THAT FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR INVESTED IN FAMILY PLANNING CARE THE STATE RECEIVES NINETY CENTS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS FEDERAL PROPOSALS OF CALL FOR SHIFTING ALL FEDERAL MEDICAID FUNDS TO STATES IN A BLOCK GRANT FORM. WITHOUT A PLAN IN PLACE ACCESS TO FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES FOR LOW INCOME AN UNINSURED CALIFORNIANS COULD BE DISRUPTED AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED SB THREE ONE PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR THAT PLAN. IN THE EVENT OF REDUCTIONS IN FEDERAL FUNDING SB THRILL ONE REQUIRED DH CS TO SUBMIT A PLAN TO THE LEGISLATURE.

SENATE BILL FIVE TWENTY SEVEN BY SENATOR CAFIERO AND ACT RELATES LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SENATOR CAFIERO THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TO PRESENT SB FIVE TWENTY SEVEN A MEASURE THAT WOULD ALLOW CANNABIS AND INDUSTRIAL HEMP CULTIVATORS TO RECEIVE THE PER THE SAME PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENT AND RELIEF. AS OTHER AGRICULTURAL SECTORS IN THE STATE BY OPERATING THEM INTO THE WILLIAMSON ACT. THE CALIFORNIA LAND CONSERVATION ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE ALSO KNOWN AS THE WILLIAMSON ACT ESTABLISHES AT THE STOP WISHED MEANS OF PROTECTING AGRICULTURAL AND OPEN SPACE LAND. BY REDUCING THE BURDENS IMPOSED BY RISING PROPERTY TAX RATES. THE ACT ALLOWS PRIVATE LANDOWNERS TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO VOLUNTARILY RESTRICT THEIR LAND TO AGRICULTURAL AND COMPATIBLE OPEN SPACE USES. THE RESULT THIS RESULTS IN SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENTS WHICH ARE BASED UPON INCOME GENERATED RATHER THAN POTENTIAL MARKET VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. IT'S IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE INCLUDE CANNABIS CULTIVATORS WITHIN THE WILLIAMSON ACT SO THEY CAN RECEIVE THE SAME. TAX ASSESSMENTS THAT AS OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AT THEIR DISCRETION ARE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHICH AG PRODUCTS ARE DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR THE FOR THE WILLIAMS ENACT TAX SAVINGS. AND IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THIS ACT SAVE AGRICULTURAL LANDOWNERS ANYWHERE FROM 2275% AND PROPERTY TAX LIABILITY EACH YEAR.

EIGHTEEN SENATOR DODD YOU PREPARED TO TAKE UP THE SIDE OF MISTER SECRETARY. PLEASE READ FILE ITEM EIGHTEEN SENATE BILL THREE THIRTY SIX BY SENATOR DODD AN ACTOR LINDA TRANSPORTATION SENATOR DODD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS SB THREE THREE SIX REQUIRES THE PRESENCE OF AT LEAST ONE PUBLIC TRANSIT EMPLOYEE. ON FULLY AUTONOMOUS -- TRANSIT VEHICLES. FULLY AUTOMATED VEHICLES CREATE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE PUBLIC TRANSIT BUT THEY POSE RISKS AS WELL. A TRANSIT A BOY NOT ONLY ENHANCES THE PUBLIC SAFETY IN EMERGENCIES BUT ALSO SUPPORTS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AND ELDERLY IN THE EVENT THAT THEY NEED ASSISTANCE UTILIZING. BOARDING IN SECURING WHEELCHAIRS FURTHER TRANSIT EMPLOYEES OFFER INFORMATION ABOUT ROUTES DIRECTIONS FOR PASSENGERS OR IDENTIFY WHERE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRANSIT SERVICE CAN BE FOUND. WITHOUT A HUMAN ON BOARD PUBLIC TRANSIT AGENCIES AND VEHICLES VULNERABLE POPULATIONS CAN BE LEFT OUT OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY. ADDITIONALLY OVER MILLION DRIVERS TRANSPORT PASSENGERS FOR A LIVING. PUBLIC TRANSIT JOBS ARE STABLE JOBS AT GOOD WAGES AND BENEFITS FULLY AUTONOMOUS PUBLIC TRANSIT -- DISPLACES WORKERS WITHOUT ANY PLAN TO RETRAIN THEM. UNTIL IT TAUGHT IN A STRIP TECHNOLOGY BECOMES MORE CAPABLE AND TACTICAL LOGICAL GLITCHES ARE WORKED THROUGH. INCLUDING A PUBLIC TRANSIT EMPLOYEE ON AND THOMAS VEHICLES WILL ENSURE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS ARE NOT MARGINALIZE UP. I'M I'M AWARE THAT SOME MEMBERS HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THIS BILL ON THE FIRST OR LAST MILE IF A PRIVATE COMPANY CONTRACTS WITH THE PUBLIC TRANSIT OPERATOR. IN I COMMIT TO WORKING TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THIS WAS NOT BROUGHT UP BUT YOU KNOW IN TILL JUST RECENTLY SO I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING ON THAT ISSUE ISSUE IS THIS -- MOVES THROUGH RESPECTFULLY AFTER I'VE. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR GLAZER. MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS -- I REGRETTABLY RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL -- TODAY SHOT. FIRST I WANT TO THANK OF MY COLLEAGUE THE SENATOR FROM NAPA. FOR RAISING A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE -- WHICH IS THE DESTRUCTION THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY. IS DOING TO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE EMPLOYMENT IN THIS FIELD. I THERE'S NOBODY ON THIS FLOOR WAS A BIGGER HEART -- THAN THE SENATOR FROM NAPA FOR THE THAT THE IMPACT THAT THAT TECHNOLOGY IS HAVING IN HIS BILL REFLECTS THAT CONCERN THAT. HE RIGHTFULLY HAS. YEAH. THIS ISSUE OF FIVE HOW INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY IS COMING INTO OUR WORLD AND THE DESTRUCTION IT CAUSES. IS A CRITICAL ONE FOR US AS LEADERS OF THE SENATE AS LEADERS IN THE STATE. I IN FACT A COLLEAGUE OF OURS FROM VENTURA HAS A HAS LEGISLATION. THAT PROMOTES A TASK FORCE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF WORK. WHICH GOES TO THE HEART OF WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO SOLVE. BUT FOR ME. THE ANSWER IS TO NOT. SIGN ME OR STOP TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION. THE ANSWER IT LIES IN EDUCATION. TRAINING AND RETRAINING. THAT THE DISRUPTION THAT'S GOING TO BE CAUSED BY. THE THE INNOVATIONS. OF AUTONOMY AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AND MANY OTHER THINGS IN OUR WORLD. ARE NOT ARE NOT SOLVED. ARE NOT SOLVED BY. PUTTING OUR HEAD IN THE SAND AND SAYING. IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN. ARE WE SHOULD PUT BARRIERS TO MAKING THAT HAPPEN. LOOK AT THE LOOK AT THE GOALS OF THE TIMES FEELS WHAT ARE WHAT ARE THEY IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO LOWER COSTS. IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE SAFETY. IT'S AN EFFORT TO PROMOTE TRANSIT. IF WE CAN GET PEOPLE FROM THEIR HOUSES OR THEIR APARTMENTS TO TRANSIT IN A MORE EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE WAY WE'RE GOING TO PROMOTE. OUR TRANSIT SYSTEMS THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT TO OUR FUTURE. THEY'RE MEANT TO THAT IT BE DONE AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WAY. THESE A THOMAS VEHICLES ARE PRINCIPALLY ELECTRIC VEHICLES. AND THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S GOING INTO THESE THE PROMOTION OF THESE VEHICLES. HELP CALIFORNIA BECOME A LEADER IN THE WORLD -- IN IN MANUFACTURING I IN THE ARE IN DE IN THIS WHOLE SPACE WHY WOULD WE WANT TO SIGN ME -- THAT WORK. IS THE TIME OF HIS VEHICLES ARE NOT SOME. ODD. THING THAT'S FAR INTO THE DISTANCE. THESE A THOMAS VEHICLES TRANSIT VEHICLES ARE BEING TESTED NOW THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ON STREETS. ON OUR PROPERTY I KNOW IN MY DISTRICT BOTH AND NOT SAN RAMON AND IN DUBLIN. THESE ECONOMIST VEHICLES ARE BEING TESTED IN MANY THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THEY I IN THIS CASE THERE TWELVE PASSENGER VEHICLES ARE NOT GIANT BUSES -- YES SIX SEATS IN SIX PLACES WHERE YOU CAN STAND -- AND WHILE WE MAY THINK THAT THIS LEGISLATION IS ONLY ABOUT GIANT BUS SYSTEMS ARE GIANT BUSES WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO LEAD IN THE FUTURE IS IT GOING TO BE SIX PASSENGER. TWELVE PASSENGER TWENTY PASSENGER. WHERE IS THIS ISSUE POTS STOP IN TERMS OF HAVING AT A TRANSIT EMPLOYEE ON EVERY EVERYONE OF THEM? SO. IT IS TRUE THAT TECHNOLOGY IS DISRUPTIVE. BUT THINK ABOUT IT -- WOULD WE SAY WE WANT TO DEFEND THE HORSE AND BUGGY WOULD WE WANT TO SAY WE WANT TO DEFEND THE TYPEWRITER. THESE THINGS ON ALL OUR DESKS. THE IN THESE THIS IS ANOTHER FORM OF DISRUPTION OF TECHNOLOGY FOR ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WE MIGHT HAVE RELIED UPON TO WRITE MEMOS AND LETTERS AND ALL THE REST OF THE THINGS THAT WE AT WEEK WE COUNT ON IN OUR WORK WORLD. SO I APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS THAT A COMMITMENT TO WORK ON THIS LAST MILE ISSUE. BUT I THINK THAT THE ANSWER TO THIS I IN THIS LEGISLATION ON THIS AREA AND THROUGHOUT STATE GOVERNMENT IS TO NOT PUT OUR HEAD IN THE SAND THE ANSWER FOR US IS THE LEAD. ON EDUCATION ON TRAINING AND RETRAINING I THINK THAT'S THE BETTER SOLUTION AND WHY CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BYE TO PRESENT ALL THE SUPPORTING -- THE BILL TODAY -- I DO HAVE. SIMILAR CONCERNS TO THOSE EXPRESSED -- BY THE SENATOR. FROM AROUND -- ABOUT -- WE NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT TECHNOLOGICAL -- CHANGES AND NOT TO REACH FOR OUT INTO THE FUTURE IN PARTICULAR -- WHEN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE'S GOING TO HOLD ON THE -- I AM HOWEVER COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY -- BECAUSE IT DOES SUNSET AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND THE REALITY IS THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE BEFORE WE GET TO A POINT. WHERE WE HAVE TRULY AUTONOMOUS? VEHICLES WITHOUT ANYONE IN THEM OPERATING -- AS PART OF OUR GENERAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE HAPPENING IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE I'M COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING THIS WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SUNSET -- BUT I DO JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT I DO ALSO HAVE THOSE QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GALGIANI. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I THINK IT'S A MODEST -- REQUIREMENT A IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THEY HAVE HIGH SPEED RAIL AND HIGHER SPEED RAIL THEY HAVE POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL THAT ALLOWS A TRAIN TO SLOW AUTOMATICALLY WHEN IT'S GOING AROUND A CURVE -- FOR IT HAS THE POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL FOR WHEN THERE'S A NEED FOR EARTHQUAKE DETECTION. AND THE LIKE BUT THEY ALWAYS HAVE SOMEBODY ON BOARD A LIVE PERSON WE KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD SAFETY ISSUES WITH PASSENGERS BOARDING -- PASSENGER RAIL AND POSING A THREAT TO WHETHER PASSENGERS THAT IS ALSO A REASON WHY WE HAVE A NEED TO HAVE SOMEBODY ON BOARD. AND THEN FINALLY FOR ANY MEDICAL EMERGENCY I WAS AT A PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL EVENT YESTERDAY AND WE HAD ONE PERSON IN ATTENDANCE WHO PASSED OUT AND BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE WERE AROUND. A MEDICAL PERSONNEL WILL BE ABLE TO BE ON THE SPOT RIGHT AWAY SO I APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS THAT WILLINGNESS TO WORK ON THAT LAST ISSUE BUT I STRONGLY RECOMMEND AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. SENATOR STERN FALL BY SENATOR MORE LOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE AROUND AUTOMATION THE FUTURE OF WORK FOR A FEW YEARS NOW THE GOVERNOR RECENTLY -- ANNOUNCED A FUTURE OF WORK COMMISSION IN FACT -- THE LAST WEEK ON INTERNATIONAL WORKERS DAY. AND ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW RIDE SHARING DRIVERS ARE STRIKING. TRYING TO FIND A BETTER WAY TO SYSTEM AND OPPORTUNITIES IN AN INCREASINGLY AUTOMATED IN NETWORK FUTURE [inaudible] THERE ARE. CHALLENGES WITH THIS LEGISLATION THE MECHANICS I THINK YOU NEED WORK. I STILL BELIEVE THAT THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS IS AN IMPORTANT WAY. TO A CERTAIN ONESELF AND FINE MECHANICS THAT ARE TAILORED TO THE NATURE OF THIS KIND OF TRANSIT SERVICE AND NOT ARBITRARILY PUSHING OUT. OTHER AUTOMATED VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES BUT THAT SAID I THINK. ON BALANCE WE HAVE TO STAND WITH THE WORKING PEOPLE OF THIS STATE. AND PUT PEOPLE FIRST AND THAT'S WHY I'M UP IN SUPPORT TODAY. AS WELL AS WITH. THOSE STRIKING AND OTHERS OUT THERE SEEKING SOME KIND OF BETTER WAGE IN THE FUTURE. THIS IS COMPLICATED THIS NEEDS WORK WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING IT COME BACK -- IN IN IMPROVE CONDITION BUT I THINK IT DESERVES OUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MORLOCK THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT IT IS GOOD TO HAVE A GOOD DEBATE ON THE FLOOR TODAY -- DRIVERLESS TECHNOLOGY ECONOMIST VEHICLES THIS IS THE FUTURE THIS IS. A TOPIC WE SHOULD REALLY BE HAVING A LOT OF FUN WITH -- SO SOMEONE WANTS TO USE A DRIVERLESS [inaudible] BUS. BUT THEY NEED DIRECTIONS SERVER ASSISTANCE ABOUT THE CITY OR TOWN YOU'RE IN. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE IPHONES YOU JUST. GET IN AND GET YOUR INFORMATION IF YOU NEED HELP WITH THE DISABILITY WELL THEN THE TRANSIT AGENCIES SHOULD BE PROVIDING VEHICLES FOR THOSE THAT HAVE. PHYSICAL NEEDS THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE EVERYBODY IS DESIGNED FOR YOU COULD ORDER A DISABILITY VAN. AND IT WOULD COME DIRECTLY TO YOU TAKE YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO GO. SO I THINK WE NEED TO GET AHEAD OF THE TECHNOLOGY NOT CLING TO THE STATUS QUO. THIS IS CALIFORNIA. WE'VE GOT TO EMBRACE THE FUTURE WE SHOULD BUILD ROADS AND COMPUTER INTERFACES TO PROMOTE THE TECHNOLOGY. THE ECONOMY IS GREAT UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT THE LOWEST IT'S BEEN HISTORICALLY A FOR LIKE SIXTY YEARS THERE ARE JOBS AVAILABLE. FOR COLLEAGUES I ATE I THINK WE SHOULDN'T BE HAS WE SHOULD NOT BE HESITANT WE SHOULD BE MOVING FORWARD. LET'S NOT PUT THE BRAKES ON THE FUTURE I URGE A NO VOTE ON SENATE BILL THREE THREE SIX THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SENATOR HUESO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST WANTED TO RISE TO OFFER -- THE VERY BRIEF COMMENTS BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT HAS BEEN SAID ON THIS BILL BUT YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN THE AUTOMOBILE REPLACE THE BUGGY IT IT WAS A NOT AN ADONIS VEHICLE THAT HAD A HUMAN BEING OPERATING AT AND IN OUREVERYWHERE WE HAVE INTRODUCED. AUTOMATION WE HAVE PEOPLE A COMPANY THAT AUTOMATION IF YOU GO TO A IF YOU GO TO A MANUFACTURER IDLE MANUFACTURING PLANT YOU'LL SEE. PEOPLE OVERSEEING THE AUTOMATION. THIS IS JUSTIN MANUFACTURING LESIONS ON MOBILE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRANSPORTATION WHERE WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION THE GOVERNMENT HAS AN OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE FOR THE PUBLIX. HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THESE PROCESSES IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT GETTING. TRANSPORTING YOURSELF FROM POINT A TO POINT B.. BUT DOING IT SAFELY AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT LOOKING FOR A LOCATION. IT'S ABOUT HAVING ALL THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE SAFE IN THAT PROCESS. THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT THERE YET LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THIS IS A VERY MODEST BILL THIS IS A VERY REASONABLE BILL. AS IT EVOLVES. IN THE MEANTIME WE'RE GONNA NEED. A HUMAN ELEMENT TO BE PART OF THIS PROCESS WITH. RIGHT CURRENTLY AS AUTONOMOUS TECHNOLOGY IS BEING DEVELOPED -- ARE LOSING THEIR LIVES IN THIS PROCESS OUT THERE. WE CAN'T RISK THIS AND IT'S NOT ABOUT STIFLING INNOVATION BECAUSE EVEN WITH -- VEHICLES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING DRIVEN BY PEOPLE IT'S NOT STOPPING THIS TECHNOLOGY FROM MOVING FORWARD IT'S NOT STOPPING INVESTMENT IN THOSE AREAS FROM TAKING PLACE IT'S NOT STOPPING [inaudible] ADVANCEMENTS IN IN IN THIS AREA I THINK IT'S LUDICROUS TO MAKE THOSE ARGUMENTS THIS BILL DOES NOT DO THAT IT'S SIMPLY INSURERS. THAT WE WILL BE THERE. IT ENSURING THE PEOPLE. ARE SAFE WHEN THEY'RE UTILIZING THIS TECHNOLOGY AND THEY'RE SAFE WHEN THEY'RE BEING TRANSPORTED. THIS IS ALL ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY THIS IS A VERY MODEST BILL I THINK. THIS DEBATE IS GREATLY EXAGGERATING WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO I HOPE EVERYBODY CAN SUPPORT IT I THINK IT'S JUST US DOING OUR JOBS AND WE'LL ALL THAT TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. THANK YOU SENATOR HUESO SEEING NO FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR DODD YOU MAY CLOSE. MADAM PRESIDENT -- PERSONAL I DO -- I APPRECIATE THE DEBATE ON THIS BILL I THINK FOR MY COLLEAGUES GOOD COLLEAGUES FROM A RENDON COSTA MESA I APPRECIATE. YOUR CONCERNS -- YET LOOK AT NOBODY IN THIS ROOM WATCHES STYMIE INNOVATION -- AND NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE THEIR HAD TO SAY AND I THINK THIS LEGISLATION -- HELP SO THAT -- IS IT IN THE FUTURE WE HAVE OPERATORS A DON'T HAVE THEIR HEAD IN THE SAND THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS LEGISLATURE -- WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE CUSTOMER SERVICE -- FOR OF YOUR PEOPLE THAT ARE IN IN WHEELCHAIRS AND PEOPLE THAT IT SENIOR CITIZENS AND WE BEEN ON SENATE TRIPS WERE. THAT THESE TYPE OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED ON THE TOP OF HIS VEHICLES -- THAT REALLY HELPED US WERE IN PARTICULAR WERE LANGUAGE IS A BARRIER -- AS WELL SO -- I COMMIT -- TO THOSE THAT HAD CONCERNS MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM SAM'S DISCO -- BROUGHT THAT UP ABOUT SOME OF THESE AREAS THESE WILL BE -- IN AREAS THAT -- WE WILL BE LOOKING AT AND I'M SURE YOU'LL HAVE SOMETHING BEFORE YOU -- YOU KNOW SOON IN CONCURRENCE THAT -- WILL HELP -- YOU WITH THIS VOTE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

YOU THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENTE I AM PLEASED TO INTRODUCE IN THE GALLERY THIS MORNING JOINING US FOR MISSION HILLS CHRISTIAN SCHOOL IN MY DISTRICT RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA. OUR MISSION HILLS CHRISTIAN SCHOOL. TO SEND THEIR TEACHER FOURTH GRADE TEACHER ALEX DOMINO PLEASE RECOGNIZE THEM AND I BELIEVE THE RIGHT UP THERE. A WARM WELCOME TO OUR STUDENTS FROM THE MISSION HILLS CHRISTIAN SCHOOL. WELCOME TO THE STATE SENATE. ALL RIGHT A COLLEAGUES GOING BACK TO THE DAILY FILE SENATOR LEYVA FILE ITEM NINETEEN WERE ON FILE ITEM NINETEEN MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL TWO TWENTY SEVEN BY SENATOR LEYVA AN ACT RULING TO HEALTH AND CARE FACILITIES SENATOR LABOR. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT GOOD MORNING AGAIN MEMBERS AS MANY OF YOU REMEMBER YOU SLICE SIMILAR VERSION OF THIS BILL LAST YEAR SB TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH WAS UNFORTUNATELY BE TELL BY THE GOVERNOR. THE FORMER GOVERNOR NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR BOTH THE COUNTLESS PATIENTS WHO SEE KEREN HOSPITALS AS WELL AS THE NURSES WHO WORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SB TWO TWO SEVEN EMPOWERS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CV PH TO ENSURE PATIENT SAFETY -- SAFETY BY FORCING MANDATED LONGSTANDING NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS AND FINING HOSPITALS THAT REPEATEDLY BREAK THE STANDARDS. FROM 200-082-2000 SEVENTEEN THERE WERE A TOTAL OF SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR OUT OF RATIO DEFICIENCY ALLEGATIONS REPORTED TO CBT CV PH. SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR TIMES THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH NURSES TO CARE FOR PATIENTS. UNFORTUNATELY THE DEPARTMENTS PRESENT ENFORCEMENT MEASURES ARE SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT CONDUCTS SURVEYS EVERY THREE YEARS TO ENSURE THE HOSPITALS ARE COMPLYING WITH THE LAW. THIS PERIODIC CHECK IS FAR TOO INFREQUENT ALLOWS HOSPITALS TO PREPARE. CD PH OFFICIALS BEFORE THEY CONDUCT THEIR SURVEY. SB TWO TWO SEVEN WOULD ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY REQUIRING THAT THE DEPARTMENT CONDUCT UNANNOUNCED VISITS TO INSPECT FOR COMPLIANCE WITH NURSE STAFFING REQUIREMENTS. THIS MEASURE WOULD ALSO EMPOWER THE DEPARTMENT TO ENFORCE THE STAFFING REQUIREMENT. WITH FINES IN CASES WHERE THOSE RATIOS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED. MEMBERS I KNOW THAT SOME OF YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOSPITALS RECEIVING FINES WHEN A NURSE CALLS OUT SICK OR HAVING A MERCHANT SEES THAT REQUIRE THEM TO UNEXPECTEDLY LEAVE WORK. IN RESPONSE TO THIS I WOULD SAY. IF HOSPITALS ARE CONTINUALLY STAFFING. LEVELS WERE FROM ONE OR TWO NURSES CALL OUT SICK PUTS THEM AT RISK OF BEING OUT OF RATIO. THEN THIS IS A SYSTEMATIC PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. SECONDLY IT IS NEVER BEEN MY INTENT TO PUNISH HOSPITALS THAT ARE GOOD ACTORS AND I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THIS ISSUE AND POLICY COMMITTEE IN THE ASSEMBLY OR WE CAN HAVE A MORE ROBUST STAKEHOLDER CONVERSATION. SB TWO TWO SEVEN IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SO THAT WE CAN PROTECT PATIENT HEALTH AND SAFETY HERE IN CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU BETTER PRESIDENT AND I CERTAINLY UPON THE AUTHORS -- ATTEMPT TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S PROPER NURSING COVERAGE IN OUR HOSPITALS BUT AS SHE MENTIONS -- INNER FOR SPEECH. TO HUNT FOR SEEN. ISSUES THAT COME UP WITH -- PEOPLE SHOWING UP LATE TO KNOW WE DO HAVE SOME TRAFFIC ISSUES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT SB ONE IS SUPPOSED TO BE SOLVING THAT HASN'T SOLVED YET. AND PEOPLE DO GET SICK AND TWO PEOPLE HAVE. SIX CHILDREN AND THESE BONDS ARE VERY PUNITIVE I MEAN FOR THE FIRST OFFENSE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE SECOND -- VIOLATION -- I DON'T THINK A HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND SAY YOU KNOW I'M GONNA TRY TO PULL BACK AS MANY NURSES I POSSIBLY PLANNED OCCURS THE BOTTOM LINE OF OUR HOSPITALS. WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE WAY OF -- HEALTH CARE RATES AND AND HOSPITAL STAYS I MEAN THEY'RE GOING UP DRAMATICALLY YOU THINK THESE FINES ARE JUST GONNA HURT THE HOSPITAL THE NEXT COULD HURT THE HOSPITAL TO BE PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMER PASSED ON TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WE SEE. RISING PREMIUMS EVERY YEAR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IS OPEN ENROLLMENT -- THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME FAIRNESS TO THIS LAW THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME LOGICAL EXCUSES -- THE ALLOW HOSPITALS TO USE THEIR BEST EFFORTS. TO MAKE SURE THOSE RATIOS ARE IN FACT IN PLACE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT SAFETY. I THINK THE BILL IS TO PUNITIVE I THINK IT'S TOO RIGID AND FOR THOSE REASONS I REGION OF THANK YOU US SENATOR CAFIERO. F. FOLLOWED BY SENATOR ROTH. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER -- QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. WOULD YOU ACCEPT A QUESTION I WOULD. CENTER COVER EUROPE YOU MAKERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THROUGH THE PRO TEM -- MY CONCERN IS ARE THE SMALL RURAL HOSPITALS OF WHICH I HAVE MANY MANY IN MY DISTRICT -- AND THEY OPERATE ON REALLY SLIM MARGINS -- THE LAST THING I THINK WE WANT IS TO DRIVE THE SMALL HOSPITALS OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE THEN WE'D HAVE NO HOSPITAL IN SOME OF OUR RURAL. COUNTIES AND SO I WONDER IF YOU COULD ADDRESS HOW YOUR BILL -- HANDLES SMALL RURAL. HOSPITALS AND IN IN YOUR THOUGHTS MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE I I DID SUPPORT THIS LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY-- I WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT MY RURAL HOSPITALS THANK YOU SENATOR I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION. SO CURRENTLY UNDER CURRENT LAW ON THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THIS -- RURAL HOSPITALS CAN APPLY FOR A WAIVER AND THE RATIO IF THEY'RE HAVING TROUBLE RECRUITING NURSES AND THEY FEEL THAT THEY WILL BE OUT OF RATIO. A RECENT STUDY WAS DONE AND IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS NO RURAL HOSPITAL HAS PULLED A WAIVER SO THEY STILL HAVE ACCESS TO THAT BUT THAT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE NOT HAVING A PROBLEM RECRUITING. BUT ALSO TWO TWO SEVEN MY CURRENT BILL CLARIFIES THAT CV PH WILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF SMALL AND RURAL HOSPITALS. PRIOR TO ADMINISTERING A FINE SO I THINK THAT WE HAVE EVEN STRENGTHENED THE LANGUAGE FOR SMALL AND RURAL HOSPITALS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES YOU KNOW I CERTAINLY pCLEARLY SUPPORT. THE FIGHT FOR BETTER INAPPROPRIATE PATIENT CARE IN OUR HOSPITAL INSTITUTIONS -- I SUPPORTED THIS BILL LAST YEAR -- WITH SOME NOTABLE CHANGES FROM THE CURRENT VERSION. AND I INTEND TO SUPPORT OF THE BILL TO MOVE IT OFF THE FLOOR. THIS YEAR BUT I CERTAINLY EXPECT THE RESTORATION OF THE PROVISIONS IN LAST YEAR'S BILL BEFORE WE SEE IT BACK HERE. ON THIS FLOOR ON THE COMEBACK SPECIFICALLY. THE RESTORATION OF THE UNEXPECTED ILLNESS AND INJURY EXCEPTION THAT WAS IN LAST YEAR'S BILL. OF THE ADJUSTMENT DOWNWARD OF THE RESET TO PROVISION FROM SIX YEARS TO THREE YEARS SINCE SOME ADJUSTMENT. IN THE FIND SCHEDULE AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT MY COLLEAGUE -- WILL BE WORKING ON THAT AS THIS BILL MOVES OFF THIS FLOOR INTO THE ASSEMBLY AND THEN BACK TO US. FOR CONCURRENCE AND WITH THAT -- AT THIS POINT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS -- ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR ROBB SEEING NO FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR LEYVA YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I THINK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE DISCUSSION AND FOR THE QUESTIONS. MEMBERS THIS BILL IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT OUR STAFFING RATIOS ARE UP TO PAR SO THAT NONE OF OUR LOVED ONES OR ANYONE ELSE'S LOVED ONES ARE PUT AT RISK. AND THE NURSES ARE PUT AT RISK YOU DON'T BECOME A NURSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A DEEP CARE AND CONCERN ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS. WE ONLY HAVE TO INSTITUTE A PENALTY BECAUSE FOR TWENTY YEARS TWENTY PLUS YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A NURSE STAFFING RATIO BUT IT HASN'T BEEN COMPLIED WITH. AND SOMETIMES UNTIL THERE'S A HAMMER. FOLKS JUST WON'T DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO SO I AS I SAID BEFORE I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING -- GOING FORWARD IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE COULD GET EVERYBODY IN A POSITION WHERE THEY SUPPORT OF THE BILL BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO IF HE GETS OFF THE FLOOR TODAY WORKING ON IT AND POLICY COMMITTEE. IN THE ASSEMBLY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR LIVE ALL DEBATE HAVING CEASED MISTER SECRETARY.

THIS BILL WOULD WAIVE ADOPTION FEES AT LOCAL PUBLIC ANIMAL SHELTERS FOR MILITARY VETERANS. MANY OF WHOM SEEK EMOTIONAL SUPPORT COMPANIONS THROUGH THE PUBLIC SHELTER SYSTEM. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO NEARLY TWO MILLION VETERANS SOME OF WHOM ARE COPING WITH PTSD OR OTHER SERVICE RELATED MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. ANIMAL COMPANIONS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO LOWER DEPRESSION LOWER LEVELS OF SOCIAL ISOLATION AND PROVIDE AN OVERALL GREATER SATISFACTION WITH LIFE. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL VETERANS IN RECOGNITION OF THEIR SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY BUT THOSE WHO TURN TO ANIMAL COMPANIONS COPE WITH PTSD AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS WILL ESPECIALLY BENEFIT. AS A LONGTIME DOG OWNER CAN ATTEST THE JOY OF HAD BRING TO ONE'S LIFE. THIS WILL OPEN THE DOOR FOR SO MANY VETERANS SEEKING COMPANIONSHIP AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT THROUGH PATRICK OPTION.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN THE STATE. WEATHER IS ASIANS AN INCREDIBLY VIABLE WAY TO SAVE MONEY FOR HOMEOWNERS AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AT THE SAME TIME. THIS BILL WOULD INCLUDE WATER EFFICIENCY MEASURES IN OUR APPROACH TO WEATHERIZATION WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A NEXUS TO WATER AND ENERGY IN FACT 20% OF THE ENERGY WE USE IN THIS STATE. IS FOR MOVING HEATING IN TREATING WATER SO WHEN YOU SAVE WATER AT HOME YOU ACTUALLY REDUCE OVERALL -- ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS NUMBER IN THE PROCESS SO WE THINK IS A GOOD COMMONSENSE MEASURE.

SENATOR STERN MOVES A CALL MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM A TWENTY FIVE SENATOR HILL. MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL THREE TWENTY SIX BY SENATOR HILL AN ACTOR LINDA CIVIL LAW SENATOR HILL THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES. SB THREE TWENTY SIX BUILDS UPON LAST YEAR'S AS P. SEVEN TWENTY ONE WHICH I AUTHORED TO ADDRESS BALCONY INSPECTIONS AND REPAIRS FOR APARTMENT BUILDINGS. FOLLOWING THE DEADLY TWENTY FIFTEEN BERKELEY BALCONY COLLAPSE THAT KILLED SIX AND INJURED. SEVEN SB THREE TWENTY SIX REQUIRES AN EXISTING CONDOMINIUM BUILDINGS GOVERNED BY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS HAVE INSPECTIONS AT LEAST ONCE EVERY NINE YEARS ON A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THEIR BALCONIES STAIR WELLS AND OTHER. EXTERIOR ELEVATED ELEMENTS TO ENSURE THEY ARE SAFE. SB THREE TWENTY SIX ALSO PREVENTION BUILDERS FROM PLACING LANGUAGE IN IN NATURE WAYS COVENANTS CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS OR CCAR'S. THAT WOULD LIMIT THE ABILITY OF THE H. AWAY BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO SUE THE DEVELOPER IF THERE ARE CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS. THIS IS NOT A HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION A CASE IS CURRENTLY BEING LITIGATED IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE A ROUTINE WATER LEAK REVEALED THAT A MAIN WALKWAY ON THE THIRD FLOOR WAS ABOUT TO COLLAPSE DUE TO WOULD DRIVE. WHEN THE H. AWAY BOARD ATTEMPTED TO FILE A CIVIL SUIT AGAINST THE DEVELOPER THEY FOUND REQUIREMENTS IN THEIR CCAR'S? PLACED THERE BY THE DEVELOPER THAT REQUIRED A FULL MEMBER VOTE BEFORE THEY COULD LEGALLY SEEK DAMAGES THAT TOOK THE BOARD NINE MONTHS. GOVERNMENTS TO CONDUCT THE MEMBER VOTE IN THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LAWSUITS NEARLY RAN OUT. THIS IS A SITUATION BECOMING ALL TOO COMMON. THESE DEVELOPER AUTHORED PROVISIONS CAN REQUIRE AS MUCH AS AN 80% MAJORITY VOTE. BEFORE THEY CAN BE SUED FOR CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS AND CAN CONVENIENTLY. THESE PROVISIONS ARE OFTEN PRECLUDED FROM BEING REMOVED WITHOUT THE DEVELOPERS CONSENT. SB THREE TWENTY SIX DOES NOT TAKE AWAY THE HOMEOWNERS RIGHT TO VOTE ON BOARD ACTIONS IT PRESERVES EACH H. ALWAYS RIGHT TO DECIDE HOW THEY WANT THEIR ASSOCIATION GOVERNED. BY KEEPING DEVELOPERS FROM INSERTING POISON PILL REQUIREMENTS THIS MEASURE PLACES THE DECISION MAKING POWER. SQUARELY IN THE HANDS OF THE HOMEOWNERS. SB THREE TWENTY SIX DOES NOT PROHIBIT DISCLOSURES OF ANY KIND PRIOR TO LITIGATION IN FACT. IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF THE EXISTING PRE LITIGATION REQUIREMENT TAKE CHOI BOARD STILL HAVE TO ENTER INTO A ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PERIOD. WITH THE DEVELOPER BEFORE FILING A CIVIL SUIT. THEY THEN HAVE TO DELIVER WRITTEN NOTICE TO ALL HOMEOWNERS AND HOLD A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE POTENTIAL ACTION. THERE ARE NO PROHIBITIONS ON WHAT IS DISCUSSED AT THE MEETING HE OPPOSITION RECENTLY RAISED CONCERNS. ABOUT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT MAY PREVENT HOMEOWNERS IN LARGE DEVELOPMENTS FROM CHANGING THEIR GOVERNING DOCUMENTS. THAT CERTAINLY NOT OUR INTENT -- AND THEY ALSO RAISE THAT THERE WERE SOME QUESTIONS RAISED. THEY ALSO RAISE THE QUESTION THAT THAT REGARDING THE TIMING OF NOTIFICATIONS OF HOMEOWNERS PRIOR TO THE FILING OF A AWSUIT WE WILL WORK WITH THEM BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT OUR INTENT TO CREATE ANY PROBLEMS IN THIS AREA -- AND WE WILL CERTAINLY WORK WITH THE UP THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE ASSEMBLY OF THE BILL MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL COLLEAGUES. DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM WILL STAR WAS SENATOR BATES FOLLOWED BY SENATOR MORALE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I JUST A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. EXCEPT THE QUESTION YES THEY WITHOUT OBJECTION. HI -- I'M I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED BECAUSE IN COMMITTEE IT SEEMS THAT HOMEOWNERS WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO VOTE. ON THAT LITIGATION OUR YEAR PRESENTATION NOW SUGGEST THAT AT SOME. POINT THEY WOULD IF NOT HAVE A VOTE WOULD BE TOTALLY APPRISED OF THE ACTION THAT WAS GONNA BE TAKEN BEFORE IT WAS TAKEN. IS THAT CORRECT THEY WOULD BE NOTIFIED OF THE ACTION BUT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE A VOTE IS THAT ACTION THAT WOULD BE LEFT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. WOULD THAT NOTIFICATION INCLUDE A DISCUSSION OF THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE OF POTENTIAL POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE OUTCOMES OF THAT. ACTION THAT THE BOARD MEMBERS SPECIFICALLY IN SINGLE YOU CAN TAKE THE NOTIFICATION IS IN EXISTING LAW TODAY WE'RE NOT CHANGING WHATEVER IS IN THE EXISTING LAW. THE THE QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION WAS THE TIMING OF THAT NOTIFICATION WITH THAT NOTIFICATION WOULD COME. PRIOR TO THE ACTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS -- FOR AFTER THAT NOTIFICATION I FRANKLY FEEL AND I BELIEVE THE OPPOSITION'S CORRECTED THAT NOTIFICATION SHOULD COME BEFORE THE ACTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WE WILL MAKE THOSE -- A CHANGES IN THE IN THE ASSEMBLY. I HOPE THAT IT WILL ON MY OWN TIME ENEMIES WITH AND I DO HOPE THAT IT WILL BE A MORE EXPANSIVE. BECAUSE I BELIEVE PROHIBITING THE HOMEOWNERS FROM AT LEAST UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACTS OF BOB POTENTIAL -- LITIGATION THE NEGATIVE AND THE POSITIVE OUTCOMES. CONSIDERING THAT THAT FALLS ON A DOWN IF THERE'S SIGNIFICANT ASSESSMENTS AND IN THE FAILURE OF THAT ACTION ARE KEEPING THEM pFAILURE OF THE BOARD MEMBERS OF THE FIELD THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES AND PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANTLY. TO THE GREATER MEMBERSHIP BOB ARE THEY A PLACE TO GREET AMOUNT OF TRUST IN THEIR BOARD MEMBERS AND I THINK WE TALK ABOUT THAT HERE IN TERMS OF ON ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. BASICALLY ABOUT IS LACKING ARE OUT IN THE IN THE WAY I READ THE BILL IN TERMS OF WHAT WOULD BE PROVIDED TO HOMEOWNERS AND SYDNEY SITTING ON A NUMBER OF BOARDS OVER THE COURSE OF TIME I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN. LOCAL ISSUES -- SOME MEMBERS SO I'D GET ON BOARD SPECIFICALLY TO ADVANCE THEIR OWN CAUSES. AND OUTPUT FOR THE ENTIRE -- HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION IN JEOPARDY IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING AND IT HAPPENED. TO HAPPEN MANY YEARS AGO AND ASSOCIATION AND I'M A MEMBER OF SO OUR I MESSED OPPOSE THAT I HOLD GOING FORWARD. I TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION SOME AMENDMENTS THE PROVIDE MORE ANALYSIS AND AND NOTIFICATION BEFORE THOSE ACTIONS ARE TAKEN. THANK YOU. I URGE A NO VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] SENATOR ARCHULETA. THANK YOU BETTER PRESENT FIRST OF ALL I RISE TO SUPPORT THE BILL. HOWEVER I'VE SPOKEN WITH THE AUTHOR AND HE ASSURES ME THEY'LL BE SOME ADJUSTMENTS MADE REFERENCE TO THE VOTING THE PEOPLE VOTING ACROSS THE BOARD OF ALL THE MEMBERS. OF THE ASSOCIATION AND THE THE THE THE OWNERS COMPLETELY THAT EVERYONE HAD THAT OPPORTUNITY AND TO BE ABLE TO SAY AND PUT IN THEIR SAY IN REFERENCE TO WHAT MAY HAPPEN. IN THE FUTURE AND I'VE BEEN A CHURCH SO I SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SING IN HEARING ON SENATOR HILL YOU MAKE THANK THANK YOU VENTURE YOU WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATE IN THIS LEGISLATION IS THE REQUIREMENT THAT THERE BE A VOTE OF THE ENTIRE MEMBERSHIP -- THAT HAS BEEN PLACED IN SOME OF THE C. C. IN ART BY THE DEVELOPER AND AND THE BUILDER OF THE THE COMPLEX THAT IS. KIND OF AN A VERY -- CUMBERSOME AND IN VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS THAT WHAT WE WILL MAKE SURE IS THAT THE BOARD BE NOTIFIED. THAT THEN THEY CAN BEFORE IT WHICH I FEEL IT SHOULD BE BEFORE PRIOR TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TAKING ANY ACTION. THE MEMBER SHOULD BE ADVISED IN AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO TO TO WEIGH IN ON THAT DECISION BEFORE IT HAPPENS THAT'S WHAT -- WE WILL BE LOOKING AT IN THE ASSEMBLY I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL COLLEGE THINKING Q.
