FOURTEEN ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. AND THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THE NUMBERS AB FOURTEEN WOULD. ESTABLISH IN STATURE WITH THE FEES CURRENTLY SET BY THE BUREAU CANNABIS CONTROLS WERE EARLIER REGARDING THE REGULATION OF CANNABIS -- IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ALL THE FEES UNDER THE BUREAU OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS OVER STATUTE THIS WOULD ESTABLISH LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER THERE'S FEES WHICH I THINK IS VERY APPROPRIATE. LIKE TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THE BILL. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS OUTLINES THREE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS WERE HAPPY TO TAKE THOSE AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. VERY GOOD ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YES COULDN'T PACK AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION -- IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY -- THE PROPOSITION PROP SIXTY FOUR GAVE CANNABIS LICENSING AGENCIES BROAD AUTHORITY TO SET FEES THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS WITHOUT. LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND THIS IS REALLY MEANT FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS ARE EMERGING INDUSTRY HAS HAD TO REMAIN FLEXIBLE AND ADAPT QUICKLY AS STATE REGULATORY FEES WERE DRAFTED AND MODIFIED. SO WE APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW HAS FINALLY -- ADOPTED. REGULATIONS. WE WOULD LIKE TO SIMPLY CODIFY THESE FEES -- SO WE CAN BRING THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IN LINE WITH ALL THE OTHER BUSINESSES OVERSEEN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS -- WE ALREADY FACE A MYRIAD OF CHALLENGES THIS BILL PROVIDES CANNABIS BUSINESSES THE SAME PEACE OF MIND AND STABILITY GRANTED TO OTHER BUSINESSES THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER JENKINS ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN FAVOR. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I WILL BRINGTHE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THE CENTER LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON I JUST HAD A QUESTION I BELIEVE THERE'S A REPORT COMING OUT ON JULY FIRST IT'S GOING TO LET US KNOW IF THE FEES WERE CHARGING NOW ARE ADEQUATE. IF THEY'RE INADEQUATE IS THAT CORRECT. YES SO WOULD WE NOT WANT TO WAIT UNTIL THAT OUR REPORT COMES OUT HERE'S MY CONCERN IF WE SET A FEE NOW AND THE REPORT COMES OUT AND SAYS THAT THE FEES ARE ADEQUATE. THEN IT COMES BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE NOBODY LIKES TO VOTE ON ANYTHING THAT INCREASES FEES OR TAXES. SO WOULD WOULD WE JUST BE BETTER SERVED IF WE JUST WAIT A LITTLE WHILE BECAUSE THE BILL THE REPORT COMES OUT A COUPLE WEEKS FOR THAT HAD OCCURRED TO ME AS WELL -- THE BUT THAT THIS INDUSTRY FACES THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FROM THE BLACK MARKET THERE ARE SEVERAL BILLS PENDING IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY -- INSTITUTE A HOLIDAY ON THOSE FEES BECAUSE OF THESE ENORMOUS PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE WITH ENFORCEMENT IN THE BLACK MARKET IN TRYING TO GUIDE. CONSUMER ACTIVITY INTO THE LEGAL CHANNELS SO -- MY RESPONSE TO THAT WOULD BE IT I WOULD SAY IT IS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD -- OR EVEN THE GIRL CANNABIS CONTROL WOULD ACT TO RAISE THOSE FEES ANYTIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE. AND IN INDEED WE MAY BE OUR BE REDUCING THEM IF SOME OF THESE BILLS PASSED SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO STABLISH THE CURRENT AMOUNT AS MAXIMUMS. AND NOT TO SAY THAT THEY CAN'T GO UP IN THE FUTURE BUT I THINK THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US TO HAVE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE RECEIPT THESE BECAUSE WE'RE THINKING OF THE BIG PICTURE I MEAN THE BUREAU CAMPUS CONTROL THE THINKING ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT THEY NEED. TO DO THEIR JOB OF REGULATING THE INDUSTRY WE'RE LOOKING AT THE AMOUNT OF A FEE STRUCTURE THAT WE NEED TO CHANNEL THIS ACTIVITY INTO LEGAL CHANNELS AND TO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WE HAVE A A FLOURISHING INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA SO I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY UNLIKELY. THAT ANY WOULD WOULD WOULD AGREE THAT THE GREATER FEES ARE A GOOD IDEA AND IN FACT WE MAY BE HAVING DISCUSSION ABOUT LOWERING THOSE FEES. WELL I THINK THAT'S VERY OPTIMISTIC -- ONLY BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH A NEW INDUSTRY AND AND WE DON'T KNOW THAT THE FEE STRUCTURE WE SET IS ACTUALLY WORKING BUT WE WILL KNOW THAT IN TWO WEEKS ACTUALLY YEAH IN EXACTLY TWO WEEKS. WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO YOU KNOW A TO AMENDING THE BILL OR SAYING THAT YOU KNOW WHEN WE GET THIS IN JUST TWO WEEKS SO WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME. THAT YOU WOULD LOOK AT THAT AND SAY HEY MAYBE WE NEED TO RESTRUCTURE IT. I'VE WE WILL CERTAINLY BE LOOKING AT THAT I THINK THAT WE ARE DOUBLE REFERRED IS THAT RIGHT. I THINK YOU'RE SEEING SO HARD. OKAY PROBES OKAY FILLED WITH FISCAL IMPACTS OF THE CONCERN IS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE CALENDAR BUT I'M SURE THAT I MEAN OBVIOUSLY TWO WEEKS WE'RE NOT GOING TO CLEAR. THE SENATE CHAMBER AND I'M SURE THAT'S A DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE HAVING WE WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING NOT TRY TO MAKE THINGS WORSE HERE. OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU READ ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER ARCHULETA. YES IN REFERENCE TO FEES. THE MEDIA UNDERSTAND THIS SHOW ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE FEES WILL BE SET. WHAT ABOUT THE THE COUNTIES AND CITIES WITHIN THE STATE ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS -- AT ALL IN THEIR FEES ARE THEY'LL BE NO FEES EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THE CITIES IN THE COUNTIES WILL FALL INTO PLAY WITH THIS WELL A ROOM -- IS. QUITE A COMPLEX PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND ESTABLISHES KIND OF A PATCHWORK QUILT OF STATEWIDE REGULATIONS AND THEN REGULATIONS THE PERMIT LOCAL CONTROL SO WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE FEES. THAT -- THE STATE WIDE A BUREAU CANNABIS CONTROL HAS AUTHORITY OVER SO THE CITIES AND COUNTIES CAN STILL IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL FEES WE'RE NOT TAKING ANY AUTHORITY AWAY FROM THE CITIES AND COUNTIES. CAN VERY GOOD THAT ANSWERED MY QUESTION THANK YOU ANYTHING ELSE FROM HER COLLEAGUES. OKAY I I DO NOTE THAT THAT REPORT IS SOUGHT. ONLY AFFECTS THE BUREAU. IT'S NOT KNOWN WHETHER SIMILAR REPORTS ARE GOING TO BE MADE. FOR DEPARTMENT OF OF FOOD IN AG. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH RIGHT TO THIS IS THIS. BUT I APPRECIATE YOU BEING SENSITIVE TO CENTER LIFE IS POINT HAS THAT AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. I WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY CLOSE GRANDFATHERED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND THE ROBUST DISCUSSION SOME GREAT QUESTIONS WERE ASKED AND JUST TO BE CLEAR. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO HEAR IS TO ESTABLISH LORD LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER THOSE FEES AND THIS IS NOT A UNIQUE SITUATION MOST OF THE FEES UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF APARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS HAVE THIS KIND OF OVERSIGHT? WE'RE JUST SAYING THAT THESE FEW SHOULD BE NO DIFFERENT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST RIVAL. FORGET THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THE VICE CHAIR CHIANG IS MOVE THE BILL THAT THE SECRETARY WOULD CALL THE ROLL THIS IS TO PASS AS AMENDED. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THIS TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS THAT THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS. GLAZER AYE GLAZER AYE CHIANG. CHING AYE ARCHULETA. ARCHULETA AYE DODD. I GALGIANI. FILLED.

SIX ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE SIXTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLY WOMAN PETRIE-NORRIS. WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING WELCOME TO BEGIN AS AS YOU ARE READY. GOOD MORNING THAT CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE THIS MORNING TO ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR AB TWELVE SIXTY FOUR THIS BILL CLARIFIES VAGUE TELEHEALTH Là. IN ORDER TO EXPAND ACCESS TO BIRTH CONTROL USING SMARTPHONE TECHNOLOGIES. AS WE ALL KNOW BIRTH CONTROL ALLOWS PEOPLE TO CHOOSE IF AND WHEN TO START A FAMILY SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FAMILY PLANNING. HAS AFFORDED WOMEN ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE AND FREEDOM THAT WE'VE USED TO ADVANCE OUR STANDING IN SOCIETY TODAY. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE I TECHNOLOGIES CREATE AIDED ANOTHER DOOR TO THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND IS AN AVENUE THAT PROVIDERS ARE USING TO REACH PATIENTS WHERE THEY ARE AND IN A WAY THAT THEY WANT TO ACCESS CARE. RIGHT NOW IN ORDER FOR WOMEN TO ORDER BIRTH CONTROL VIA A SMARTPHONE APPS YOU MUST FIRST SCHEDULE A VIDEO CONFERENCE. THIS IS PROVEN TO BE A BARRIER THAT HAD THE PROFESSIONALS CONSIDERED TO BE MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY SO WHAT AB TWELVE SIXTY FOUR DOES IS. CLARIFIED THAT HE SYNCHRONOUS VIDEO CONFERENCE IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE BIRTH CONTROL AND THAT A APPROPRIATE PRIOR EXAM COULD INCLUDE AN ASYNCHRONOUS QUESTIONNAIRE. PLANNED PARENTHOOD HEALTH CARE CENTERS THIS WILL SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE ACCESS TO BIRTH CONTROL. ON AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S AN APPROPRIATE SHIFT IN THE GUIDELINES WE MESS UPDATER COULD SECTIONS REFLECTOR CHANGING TECHNOLOGIES AND TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO ORDER CONTRACEPTIVES. I HOWEVER THEY ARE ABLE TO DO SO. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND I'M PLEASED TO INTRODUCE OUR SPONSOR HERE TO TESTIFY MOLLY ROBSON WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD VERY GOOD THANK YOU [inaudible] PLEASE. I MOTHER OF THEM WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD I WE REPRESENT SEVEN AFFILIATES WHO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA -- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE ANALYSIS AND WORK ON THE AMENDMENTS. I WANNA MAKE ONE CLARIFICATION WHICH IS ON PAGE THREE OF THE ANALYSIS -- CURRENTLY PP DIRECT DOES NOT PROVIDE STD TEST KITS IN CALIFORNIA. DIRECT EXIST IN MANY STATES -- AND SERVICES VERY SO JUST. FYI -- BUT WE ARE SPONSORING THIS BILL THE RIGHT CLARITY IN THE LAW RELATED TO PRESCRIBING MEDICATIONS VIA TELEHEALTH SUCH AS BIRTH CONTROL -- AFTER WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS WE BROUGHT IN THE BILL TO CLARIFY THAT. APPROPRIATE PRIOR EXAMINATION AND PRESCRIBING VIA TELEHEALTH GENERALLY. SO DESPITE CONTINUED INVESTMENTS AND HEALTH CARE THROUGH THE STATE BUDGET. WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE STILL AN UNMET NEED FOR BIRTH CONTROL IN CALIFORNIA AND TELL HEALTH CAN HELP -- WITH THIS BARRIER. AND AS YOU KNOW THE GOAL OF TELEHEALTH IS TO PROVIDE THE SAME STANDARD OF CARE IN A WAY PATIENTS WANT TO ACCESS CARE AS THE AUTHOR MENTION. RECOGNIZING THIS WE CREATED PP DIRECT THROUGH PLANNED PARENTHOOD -- TO PROVIDE BIRTH CONTROL THROUGH AN ASYNCHRONOUS A STORM FOR TECHNOLOGY. THE OP LUNCHEON CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND HOT OVER FIVE HUNDRED PATIENTS ON AVERAGE A MONTH. BUT DO THE AMBIGUITY IN THE LOT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE WERE IT BEGAN REQUIRING SYNCHRONOUS VIDEO CONFERENCE BETWEEN PATIENT AND CLINICIAN. THIS IS AN OBLIGATION REQUIRED IN FIFTEEN OTHER STATES THAT USE THE PP DIRECT OP. I MEDICAL EXPERTS AS MENTIONED HAVE DETERMINED THAT IT'S UNNECESSARY. THIS APP IS MEETING PATIENTS WHERE THEY ARE BUT THE REQUIREMENT FOR VIDEO CONFERENCE CAUSE A DISRUPTION CARE AND AN ESTIMATED 50% OF PATIENTS WERE NOT FULFILLING THE REQUIREMENT TO GET THE BIRTH CONTROL. AB TWELVE SIXTY FOUR PROVIDES CLARITY THE NEW APPROPRIATE FOR EXAMINATION IS TO BE DETERMINED BY THE MEDICAL LICENSE FEE. AND A SYNCHRONOUS REAL TIME AS IT IS NOT REQUIRED TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO PROVIDE HOMEOWNER BIRTH CONTROL TO A PATIENT -- THIS APPLE OUT PP DIRECTED ME THAN UNMET NEED AND PROVIDE ACCESS TO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I FIRST WANT TO THANK. TO START BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. AND I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE OF AMENDMENTS AB TWELVE NINETY ONE CLARIFIES THE TIME FRAME FOR WHEN CAMPUS BUSINESSES NEED TO COMPLY WITH LABOR PEACE AGREEMENT REQUIREMENTS. A LABOR PEACE AGREEMENT S AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN A BUSINESS AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT PRESCRIBED ALLEGATION OF EACH PARTY. THESE AGREEMENTS TEND TO INCLUDE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL PROVISIONS THAT PROTECT BUSINESSES AND IMPORTANTLY EMPLOYEES CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT CANNABIS BUSINESSES WITH TWENTY OR MORE EMPLOYEES ENTER LABOR PEACE AGREEMENT. AS PART OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS TO OBTAIN A CANVAS LICENSE BUSINESSES WITH AT LEAST TWENTY EMPLOYEES ARE REQUIRED TO STATE THAT THEY WILL ENTER LABOR PEACE AGREEMENT IF THE BUSINESS AT ALL IT'S NOT ALREADY ENTERED. ONE HOWEVER CURRENT REGULATIONS ARE SILENT. ONLY BUSINESSES WITH LESS THAN TWENTY EMPLOYEES NEED TO ENTER A LABOR PEACE AGREEMENT. IF THEY BECOME EMPLOYERS OF TWENTY OR MORE REGULATIONS ONLY SAY THIS REQUIREMENT NEEDS NEEDS TO BE WILL BE MET AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE. WHICH IS VAGUE AND ALL OPEN TO INTERPRETATION AB TWELVE NINETY ONE WILL REQUIRE CANNABIS BUSINESS LICENSE. APPLICANTS EMPLOYING LESS THAN TWENTY EMPLOYEES TO SUBMIT A STATEMENT THAT WILL ENTER A LABOR PEACE AGREEMENT WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF EMPLOYING THEIR TWENTIETH EMPLOYEE. THIS MEASURE WILL PROTECT ARBITRARY ENFORCEMENT AGAINST CANVAS BUSINESSES AND WILL PROVIDE EMPLOYEES WITH CLARITY -- WHEN AN EMPLOYER IS BAILEY TO COMPLY WITH THIS LAW WITH ME TODAY?
