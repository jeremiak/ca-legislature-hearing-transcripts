SCHOLARSHIP IT'S GOOD TO LAUNCH TO SEE AND PROVIDER STEVEN ACCOUNT- YOU DEPOSIT OUR- EVERY MORNING CALIFORNIA THE PROPOSAL BETWEEN FIVE DOLLARS.

HAVING MORE PROGRAM- ONE THINKING THAT. ARE FOR FAMILIES NAVIGATE- TO MAKE IT MORE FOR YOU PROGRAM. YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN REMOVED ONLY GARNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. SHARE NO COMMENTS FROM CD AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. OKAY FROM. MY ADMONITION ABOUT BEING BRIEF WAS TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY. THANK YOU- LET ME ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A QUESTION TO BEGIN WITH AND THAT IS IN ESSENCE RESPONDING TO THE CONCERN THAT WAS EXPRESSED BY THE OHIO. A WHY ARE WE CREATING A SECOND STATE PROGRAM WHY NOT BUILD OFF OF EXISTING PROGRAMS WHICH REPLACES. HAVE ELIGIBILITY IN PLACE. THERE'S ALSO SEVERAL LOCAL PROGRAMS HOW WOULD ALL THESE OPTIONS WORK TOGETHER FOR FAMILIES. I REALLY TRAVIS BUT THE BOMBING OF FINANCE- TRANSLATING YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION- THE CURRENT PROGRAM- IT'S- AT THE GRANT PROGRAM THE PROPOSED PROGRAM DOES NOT INTERACT WITH EXISTING PROGRAMS. THAT SAY WE RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR BETTER LINKING TO EXISTING PROGRAMS AND WE WELCOME I CONTINUE CONVERSATION TO THE TOPIC OVER THE COMING WEEKS. I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT THIS PROGRAM IS SPECIFICALLY TAILORED FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. ANY PROVIDES A LONG TERM- FUNDING FOR THIS ACCOUNT. AND I HAVE A HAND FROM YOUR COLLEAGUE. SO WHAT WE RECOGNIZE FOR. THANK YOU MISTER AT THE BILL ABBEY COME I WOULD KNOW THAT THE PROGRAM PROVIDER. RATHER AND THEN THE REVISION INCLUDE ONGOING FUNDING WHEREAS PREVIOUS ITERATIONS OF THE PROGRAM. ALL KIDS AS AN EXAM WHERE THE ROOF OF ONE TYPE OR SO EASY THIS IS OTHER I LOVE MY CAR COLLEAGUE THAT DOESN'T LONG SOLUTION. TO THAT. WELL I A- BUT FOR- ONE JUST BECAUSE- THAT. THAT IF A FAMILY IS CHOOSING TO COMPLETE THE FREE AND REDUCED MEAL. APPRISED ME OF PAPERWORK. OR IT IS ENSURED THAT THEIR KID IS DESIGNATED AS AN ENGLISH LEARNER THEY'RE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE SYSTEM IN CERTAIN WAYS AND I APPRECIATE. MS CHAVEZ'S COMMENT ABOUT THIS IS A CONVERSATION SO I JUST WANT TO ANNOUNCED THIS IS A CONVERSATION WE WILL WANT TO HAVE. A BECAUSE WHAT IF THIS GOES AHEAD WE THINK THERE ARE SOME STREAMLINED WAYS TO DO THIS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT PROPOSALS SO LET ME JUST ANNOUNCED THAT. AN ENEMY THE QUESTION I WANT TO ASK. IS AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL. AND IT'S- RIGHT NOW WE HAVE PEOPLE GOING INTO DEBT EXTENSIVELY IN HIGHER EDUCATION WHY ARE WE PRIORITIZING FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR KIDS THAT ARE YEARS AND YEARS AWAY FROM COLLEGE BOB- FOR REFORMING THE STUDENT AID PROGRAM AND HELPING PEOPLE THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH COLLEGE DEBT RIGHT NOW. THEN I WOULD START WITH FINANCE. I WAS WITH THE FINAL FINANCED THANK YOU FOR YOUR CHANGE THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION CHAIR- YES THE PROGRAM IS FOCUSED ON THE LONG TERM INVESTMENT. FOR LIVE WHERE PLACING ONLY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR STUDENTS YOU KNOW WHAT HOPING THAT THEY INVESTMENT GROUP WILL POST SATURDAY STUDENT WELL WHEN THE PERSON ATTENDS COLLEGE. IT IS ALSO THE MENTALITY OF A STUDENT WHO MAYBE THE PARENTS DON'T HAVE A CHECKING ACCOUNT. OR DON'T EVEN GO TO A BANK BUT THEN THEY CAN'T NOW HAS AT IN MIND SAYING THAT THERE IS SOME COLLEGE SAVINGS FOR HIS FUTURE OR FUTURE- WE ALSO WANT A POINT JUST. POINT OUT THAT THE CURRENT BUDGET AND THE MANY REVISIONS FOCUSED ON INVESTMENTS THAT MAY BE A ONE TIME FUNDING. BUT COULD POTENTIALLY PROVIDE LONG TERM- BENEFITS SUCH AS A STUDENT HOUSING THAT COVERS MORE OF THE. OVERALL COST OF THE STUDENT. R. L. DO YOU HAVE SOME. AS WELL. IT'S A BIG I WAS NORTH EARNED QUESTION A CENTERS GOING TO BE BALLOTS ONE KIND OF BIG QUESTION ABOUT HOW TO PROVIDE INDEED THIS ONE OF MANY WAYS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS- WHO ARE PURSUING HIGHER EDUCATION ITSELF- ON ANOTHER APPROACH WOULD BE AS YOU MENTIONED PROVIDING NO BUILDING UP YOUR EXISTING FINANCIAL PROGRAMS LET LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHEN THEY ARE READY TO ENTER HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND HOW MANY MORE OF THOSE. COSTS ARE COVERED BY THE STATE. I CALLED. THAT- HOME. THESE DO NOT HAVE TO BE MUTE EXCLUSIVE BAND OF THIS IS A VERY VALID AND GOOD CONCEPT AND I KNOW AND ONE OF MY COUNTIES IN THE DISTRICT- THERE'S AN ATTEMPT TO DO OUR CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNT AT A MUCH MORE SMALLER LEVEL TO TRY TO. TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME OBJECTIVE OBJECTIVE AND I THINK WE'RE REALLY COMMITTED TO REFORMING THE STUDENT AID AND SO I REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN MAKE ALL THESE THINGS WORK TOGETHER AND NOT CHOICE SO ARE THERE WILL BE CONVERSATIONS TO COME- MISTER BETTER SENATOR MEANT DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS MR IS ALSO FINE- LET ME- YES FOLLOW UP ON YOUR COMMENTS. I GUESS I YOU PERCENT A QUESTION- I WAS UNCLEAR FROM READING THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS PROGRAM WHETHER THIS WOULD BE MORE ORIENTED AS A DEPOSITORY TYPE- FUND OR WHETHER IT WOULD BE. INVESTED IN EQUITIES AND OKAY INDEX FUNDS AND OTHER- SECURITIES OUT IN THE MARKET. PROBABLY FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR ANYONE WHO HAVE HAD A ROLE IN DESIGNING THIS MAYBE COULD JUST. ELUCIDATE FOR ME LIKE WHAT WHAT'S THE PROGRAM LOOK LIKE IS IT IS IT GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT HAS. YOU KNOW MORE LIKE BANKRATE'S AND IT'S SAFE FOR WILL BE SOMETHING THAT MAYBE A LITTLE RISKIER BECAUSE AND A HIGHER YIELD INVESTMENTS. SORRY OUT OF RENT THE APARTMENT OF FINANCE WE DO THINK THAT THAT THE AYE CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNT- PROGRAM WELL WE WOULD DEFINITELY BE WORKING WITH OUR- COLLEAGUES WERE EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF THAT VALLEY FAIR INVESTMENT BOARD. I DO WORK OUT THE DETAILS ON EXACTLY HOW THE INVESTMENTS WAY THAT WOULD ALLOW. YEAH I MEAN I WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT YOU KNOW I PUT A THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR OPEN A THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR BANK ACCOUNT FOR MY KID ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT IN THAT ACCOUNT AND I WAS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THREE DOLLARS. WITH WITH. THE RIGHT. BEING THEY ARE- I DON'T THINK THAT'S A FAIR. WAY TO BUILD WELL. I OKAY. ECHOED FOR ALERTS. THIS IS. A REALLY IMPORTANT. BUILDING WEALTH DISADVANTAGED. COMMUNITIES AND CHILDREN IN PARTICULAR IS A VEXING PUBLIC POLICY PROBLEM. AND I APPLAUD THIS APPROACH. BUT I THINK THAT WE PROBABLY WANT TO LOOK MORE TO WHAT. THE SCHOLAR SHARE THE FIVE TWENTY NINE TYPE PROGRAMS ARE DOING- BUT THAT GETS TO MY SECOND QUESTION WHICH IS. IF WE'RE GOING TO KIND OF TAKE. YOU BACK ON THE SCHOLARSHIP CARE. WHY MAKE ANY. OR NOT DO YOU EXISTING. TO TRY TO- PROVIDE THIS FUNDING I KNOW IT'S ALWAYS COOL TO MAKE A NEW PROGRAM. BUT A NEW PROGRAM COMES WITH NEW ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS- A IN THE OF THE BUILDING FROM THE GROUND UP AND- IT SEEMS LIKE THOSE PATHWAYS ALREADY EXIST FOR DISTRIBUTING THESE FUNDS TO CHILDREN AFFECTIONATELY. THROUGH THE SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM SO I WOULD. I GUESS I'D BE INTERESTED IN YOUR REACTION AND. AND HEARING WHETHER YOU'RE OPEN TO. YOU KNOW TRYING TO USE SOME OF THE- KIDS ARE OR OTHERPATHWAYS RATHER THAN BUILDING SOMETHING BRAND NEW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS SENATORS- WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR FEEDBACK TO OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GREAT OF CONDENSING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS HELLO LET ME THANK THE PANEL AND- JUST DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT THIS WILL BE A CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD JUST AS I SAID EARLIER AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING IT SO WE APPRECIATE THE PROPOSAL WE APPRECIATE PEOPLE THAT PERCENT TODAY. SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER TWO WHICH IS OUR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MAY REVISION OVERVIEW. OUR THREE PANELISTS ARE ERIN A READY UP FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAN COUPON FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND ALLIE GARNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WILL TAKE PEOPLE IN THAT ORDER AND TO BEGIN WITH THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING THIS IS YOUR MEMBERS THANK YOU ARENARIA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HERE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE- AN OVERVIEW OF OUR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE AND WE UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS WITH. THE ISSUE OF BREVITY SO THANK YOU. NO PROBLEM YOU LET ME KNOW AFTER HOW IT WENT- SO WORLD PROVIDED THERE IS AN AFTER I WILL LET YOU KNOW YEAH. THERE WILL BE THERE WILL BE- WITH STRONG REVENUE INCREASES AS EVERYONE HAS HEARD ABOUT OVER THE TWENTY TWENTY. BUDGET ACT LEVELS- THAT WE ASSUMED AT THAT TIME PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND IS UP A TOTAL OF MORE THAN FORTY BILLION DOLLARS COMPARED TO THE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT PROCESS THREE YEAR PERIOD. AND ALMOST SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW RESOURCES TO PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND OVER- GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ACROSS THAT SAME THREE YEAR PERIOD. AND WITH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT STILL IN A TEST ONE IN EACH OF THOSE YEARS I IT WILL TAKE. THIRTY EIGHT CENTS FOR EVERY NEW GENERAL FUND DOLLARS THAT WORK TO- COME TO BE. A PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IN THE PRIOR YEAR IS UP TO ABOUT SEVENTY NINE POINT THREE BILLION TOTAL CURRENT YEAR IS NINETY TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION. AND THE BUDGET YOUR TOTAL IS NINETY THREE POINT SEVEN AND THAT'S THE TOTAL FOR THE ENTIRE GUARANTEED. NOT JUST BE OUR K. TWELVE SHARE. THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSES TO REMOVE WHAT WOULD NOW BE A TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT. YOU MAY RECALL THAT AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT'S OF LITTLE PAYMENT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE TWO POINT THREE BILLION. AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THAT'S BE COOL TOO ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE PER FOR NOT ABOUT EXACTLY 1405% OF TOTAL. GENERAL FUND REVENUES- AND THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL PAYMENT ON TOP OF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE CALCULATION AND THIS WAS PROPOSED. AFTER TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT TO BE APPLIED IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND IN SEVERAL YEARS UNTIL AN AMOUNT OF ABOUT TWO TWELVE POINT. FOUR BILLION WAS REPEATED OVER SEVERAL YEARS- AND WITH FACTORS CHANGING SUCH THAT NOW. THE ENVIRONMENT. THAT PRECIPITATED THAT COMMERCE. IN SOMETHING- PROPOSING- THE OF ONE OF PAYMENTS AS- PRETTY MUCH COULD. RIVER WE HAVE WE ARE PROPOSING TO REMOVE NOT ONLY ABOUT YOUR PAYMENTS WHICH WAS OUR PROPOSED THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. BUT ALSO THE BUDGET YOUR PAYMENT. I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT MORE IF FOLKS HAVE MORE QUESTIONS- WHAT THE TEST ONE AMOUNTS. FAR EXCEEDING THE CALCULATED TEST TO AMOUNTS AT A IN THE CURRENT YEAR IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THEN OUR CAP GAINS REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS EXCEEDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROJECTIONS THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVE DEPOSITS ARE ALSO INCREASED FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. TO JUST UNDER TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND- TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS RESPECTIVELY IN EACH OF THOSE YEARS. AND SIMILAR TO OUR GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FORECASTS THAT AMOUNT OF A RESERVE BALANCE AFTER THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR. WOULD TRIGGER THE SCHOOL DISTRICT- SERVE CAPS BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE PER STATUTE. ADA AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE HAS CONTINUED TO DECLINE- THOUGH WITH NOT MUCH OF A PRACTICAL IMPACT ON THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING LEVEL SENSE INFLATION AND ENROLLMENT CHANGES ARE ONLY FACTORED INTO THE TEST TWO. AND TEST THREE LEVELS AND AS I SAID WE ARE STILL IN TEST ONCE. IN EACH YEAR- WITH BROAD THE EIGHT AT UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF FOR PEOPLE FUNDING. ALMOST FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR PEOPLE AT THIS POINT AT THE MAY REVISION- THE MAYOR VISION MAKES SEVERAL STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS WITH APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FOUR BILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING PROPOSALS AND SIX BILLION. IN ONGOING INVESTMENTS FOR K. TWELVE STUDENTS DON'T PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WHILE ALSO PRIORITIZING RESOURCES. TO THOSE THAT ARE IN COMMUNITIES MOST JUST. REALLY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. WITH ALL OF NEW OF A SPEND. AND THE COMPUTING POWER THERE. WE ARE PROPOSING TO ME. A BUDGET YEAR PAGE DEFERRAL OF APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS ALSO ROUGHLY EQUAL TO THE- R. NINETY EIGHT RESERVE DEPOSIT I MENTIONED THAT IS HAPPENING IN THE BUDGET YEAR- LASTLY. AS MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD- DUE TO A COMBINED. STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT. OVERAGE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR. K. TWELVE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES WILL RECEIVE A TOTAL. ESTIMATED CURRENTLY AT EIGHT POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING ABOVE THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE. AS REQUIRED PER THE CONSTITUTION CURRENTLY PROPOSED ALLOCATION IN THE TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR ONCE THE FINAL OVERAGE AMOUNT. IS KNOWN. YOU'LL HEAR PLENTY MORE ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF THE DIFFERENT- HE TOLD FUNDING PROPOSALS AT THE MAYOR VISION OUT FOR ME AND MY COLLEAGUES ON LEADER PANELS. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ON MY PRESENTATION. WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND THEN WE'LL GO TO THE L. A. O. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAN GET ON WITH ALLEGE ANALYST OFFICE I'LL BE GIVING YOU A FEW SHORT HIGHLIGHTS AND ANALYSIS OUR OFFICE PUBLISHED EARLIER THIS WEEK. BACK IN JANUARY YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER US SAYING THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CONTAINED THE BIGGEST BET YOUR INCREASE IN K. FOURTEEN FUNDING. SINCE THE ADOPTION OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. AND THIS MAY REVISION CONTINUES RIGHT ON THAT SAME TRACK BECAUSE THE NUMBERS BEFORE YOU ALSO REPRESENT THE LARGEST INCREASE IN FUNDING FROM JANUARY TO MAY. I IN THE HISTORY OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. ARE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTION THOSE BIG INCREASES THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD. AND THOSE INCREASES REALLY ARE ABOUT 40% OF THE INCREASE IN GENERAL FUND REVENUES. AS REQUIRED BY OUR CONSTITUTIONAL FORMULAS. WE THINK THOSE ESTIMATES OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES ENDING HERE AND HERE REASONABLE WE CAN GIVE YOU A GOOD STARTING POINT FOR BUILDING YOUR BUDGET. I WE ALSO THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT IS REASONABLE. THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE RIGHT NOW IS ABOUT AS FAR ABOVE THE CREEK AND THAT DEMOCRATS WILL AS WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HELLO THE CREEK AND DEMOCRATS THE LAST YEAR AND- SO THE RECOVERY THAT PAYMENT WAS ATTENDED TO A CHEESE. HAS HAPPENED. OF THE TOTAL INCREASE IN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING OVER THE ENTIRE NINETEEN TWENTY THROUGH TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO PERIOD. IS FIFTEEN POINT FOUR BILLION. AS FAR AS THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF THIS BUDGET THE GOVERNOR RECOGNIZES THAT HIGHER GUARANTEE SETS ASIDE MONEY AS REQUIRED IT TO MAKE THE HIGHER PROPOSITION AND YET RESERVE DEPOSIT- AND THEN ALLOCATES 89% OF THE REMAINING INCREASE TO SCHOOLS 11% COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THE STATE'S ASKED PRACTICE ARE YOU HEARD SEPARATELY ABOUT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROPOSALS- SO FOCUSING JUST ON THE K. TWELVE- YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAD A LITTLE BIT OVER. I'M MORE THAN SEVENTEEN POINT THREE BILLION IN NEW I KICKOFF APOSTLES IN JANUARY I JUST MAKE THE VISION ADDS ANOTHER CALLED POINT SIX BILLION IN NEW PROPOSALS ON TOP OF THAT AMOUNT. SO TOTAL ON THIS PACKAGE HAS ABOUT THIRTY BILLION IN NEW K. TWELVE. SPENDING PROPOSALS. I WON'T COVER ANY OF THE DETAILS OF THOSE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS YOU YOU'LL GET INTO THOSE- IN LATER PANELS. BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU A- TAKE OUR OUR OF OVER TAKE- AT THIS BIG OF. I THINK THIS WELL WE THINK THERE ARE SOME KEY STRENGTHS HERE SO JUST MAKE A VISION HAS SOME Y. JOB LYNN TATIAN IS FOR KEY LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES- ABOUT OTHERS MORE FUNDING FOR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS- I'M MORE FUNDING FOR STUDENT SUPPORT. A LARGE DOCUMENTATION TO THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. ALL THINGS THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN INTERESTED IN IN THE PAST. THIS BUDGET ALSO HAS A LARGE ONE TIME QUESTION. OF THE TOTAL PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SPENDING THAT'S ATTRIBUTABLE TO TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SPECIFICALLY I NEARLY SEVEN BILLION IS FOR ONE TIME ACTIVITIES. AND THAT GIVES YOU A LARGE ONE TIME QUESTION AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WE GUARANTEE WERE TO DROP NEXT YEAR THE YEAR AFTER HAT. A CHRISTIAN GIVES YOU A WAY TO AVOID. CUTS TO ONGOING PROGRAMS OR CREATING NEW DEFERRALS- ANTI DOES NOT DROP. THE STATE CAN USE THOSE FREED UP FUNDS AT THAT TIME TO PROVIDE AUGMENTATIONS THAT ADDRESS. ISSUES THAT EMERGED AND NEW CONCERNS AT THAT TIME. WE ALSO THINK THIS MAY ADDITION HAS SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN SOME AREAS OVER THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET. WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT LATER ABOUT HOW WE THINK THE TRANSITION PROPOSAL FOR IMPLEMENTING UNIVERSAL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. IS BETTER THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAD PUT FORWARD IN JANUARY WE ALSO THINK THERE ARE SOME CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO HIS PROPOSALS AROUND THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS GRANT PROGRAM. IN TERMS OF- CONCERNS THAT WOULD HIGHLIGHT- YOU'LL HEAR US I THINK FLAG TO A LARGE PROPOSALS THAT WE THINK ARE. AREN'T% NECESSARY I SAW ONE OF THOSE IS GOING TO BE TWO POINT SIX BILLION FOR TARGETED INTERVENTION AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER TWO BILLION FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY ACTIVITIES. WHAT IS YOUR S. Y. L. USA IS THAT SALES OUR TO PROVIDE A LOT OF FUNDING FOR THOSE. AS IN SO. WE DON'T THINK ANOTHER ROUND OF FUNDING IS NEEDED AT THIS TIME. OUR OTHER CONCERN IS THAT WE THINK THIS BUDGET MISSES AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD MORE- SCHOOL BUDGET RESILIENCY SO SPECIFICALLY LEAVING TWO POINT SIX BILLION AGAIN DEFERRALS REMAINING AND- NOT NOT PROVIDING ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING. I TRIED UNFUNDED PENSION COSTS WE THINK THAT ADDRESSING BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES THAT WOULD BENEFIT STUDENTS BY INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES DISTRICTS I CREATE THIS YEAR I WITH ONE TIME FUNDING CAN BE SUSTAINED OVER TIME. BUT ALSO PREPARE DISTRICTS IN THE STATE TO BETTER DEAL WITH THE NEXT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND SO WE THINK SHIFTING FUNDING LOOK AT MORE IN THAT DIRECTION. WITH WOULD BE A VERY GOOD WAY TO- IMPROVE UPON ON THE PACKAGE BEFORE YOU. I SO WITH THAT- COLLEAGUES AGAIN COVER A LOT OF THESE ISSUES IN MORE DETAIL WHAT IMPACT CAPITA ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NOW WILL MOVE ON TO ELOISE GARDNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. OF. GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY ALLEN GARNER ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND. WE ARE PLEASED THAT THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES THE LARGEST LEVEL FUNDING FOR EDUCATION AND LARGEST K. TWELVE EDUCATION PER PUPIL EXPENDITURE IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. THE COMPANY TEAM CONDEMNING HAS WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY GAPS WE LOOK FORWARD TO A CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS IN THE WEEKS AHEAD. TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE OPPORTUNITY GAPS TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS RETURNED SAFELY TO SCHOOL FOR IN PERSON LEARNING AND TO MAKE SURE ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS HAVE A SAFE AND SAFE ENVIRONMENT AND- EQUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXCEL. WE WERE JUST REQUEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDER THE SAME COLOR FOR CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS AS FOR THE LCS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION PARTICULARLY THE EXTENT THAT ADDITIONAL REVENUES ARE IDENTIFIED. I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BOMB. I'M GOING TO ASK A QUESTION OF FINANCE BUT IT'S MORE A BRIEF STATEMENT TO AND THEN COMMENT ON IT. IT AND IT JUST BASICALLY WITH- OF. THE RECORD REVENUES- THAT- ONE TIME WAS PROP NINETY EIGHT WHY NOT PAY OFF THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT. THE INFERENCES SO WE'LL HAVE MORE THAN THAT IN THE EDUCATION OF RAINY DAY FUND. AND IF THE ECONOMY TANKS OR REVENUES GO DOWN WE'RE GOING TO NEED THE MONEY IN THAT FUND TO BRIDGE L. E. H. NOT TO PAY OFF DEFERRALS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE PAID. OFF WHEN WE HAVE THE BIGGEST ONE TIME MONEY IN THE HISTORY OF PROP NINETY EIGHT SO. WHY WAS THE CHOICE MADE TO NOT PAY OFF THE DEFERRALS AND- RELY IN THE FUTURE MAY BE ON THE RAINY DAY FUND WHEN WE HAVE THIS BIG AMOUNT OF MONEY. CERTAINLY HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT AREA BERMAN FINANCE AGAIN. SO THE WAY THAT WE I THOUGHT ABOUT IT IS A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS SO YOU MENTIONED THE- THE INCREASE IN ONE TIME FUNDING AND THAT'S TRUE BUT I WOULD SAY THAT TO SOME EXTENT THAT'S- EXACTLY WHY. THE DEFERRALS BE MAINTAINING THE AMOUNT THAT IT IS BECAUSE SHOULD WE MOVE TO A FUTURE YEAR- WHICH GENERALLY WILL ENSURE THE ECONOMY FARE POORER THAN WE ARE CURRENTLY EXPECTING AS YOU MENTION- THE WAY THAT THE- RAINY DAY RESERVE DEPOSITS WORK. IN THE FIRST INITIAL TWO YEARS AFTER THEY ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED DESERVES A TRUCK MECHANISM. SO THOSE APOSTLES ARE MADE BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT- THINGS CHANGE AND IN THE ECONOMY AND THOSE ARE NO LONGER NEEDED- THERE COULD BE. AN IMMEDIATE JUST REDUCTION AND ALL THAT SO IT'S ESSENTIALLY WE BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A ONE TIME COST. IT FREES UP MONEY. IN THE FUTURE BY IN A LIGHT COME OUT- AND TO THE EXTENT THAT ECONOMIC INDICATORS CHANGE SO MUCH THAT THERE WAS ACTUALLY REQUIRED WITHDRAWAL PER THE CONSTITUTIONAL LANGUAGE. BUT AGAIN THAT WOULD HELP US. AS WELL AND I THINK FROM A LARGER GLOBAL- ENTIRE BUDGET PERSPECTIVE. WE REALLY LOOKED AT OKAY BETWEEN THE MAKES OF ONE TIME AND ONGOING FUNDING WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING. TO ALLOW US TO- REALLY PRIMARY. ME RESOURCES AS WE COULD TOWARDS LIKE I SAID EARLIER THOSE COMMUNITIES MOST IN NEED OF IT ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC WHILE ALSO SHORING UP. DISTRICT BUDGETS THROUGH A PROVIDING A LARGER COLO FIVE POINT 007% ON THE LC FIVE WHICH IT IMPROVES FUNDING. FOR EVERY DISTRICT EVEN THOSE WHO MAY NOT RECEIVE. LARGE SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION GRANTS PERCENTAGE AMOUNTS- DOT DOT I THINK WAS DEFINITELY AN ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION. AS WELL AND I THINK ON A CASH BASIS- THIS IS JUST A JUNE TO JULY DEFERRAL AND ESPECIALLY IN THE IN THIS YEAR AND NEXT YEAR IS VERY LIKELY WITH SO MUCH MONEY THAT MEETING ELEAZAR RECEIVING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS FROM US AT THE STATE- THAT MANY. DISTRICTS ARE LIKELY TO BE IN A RELATIVELY STRONG CASH POSITION AND SO WE DON'T FORESEE THIS AS- SOMETHING THAT WOULD. REALLY BE. TO MUCH OF A HARDSHIP FOR THEM IF AT ALL AND WE ARE STILL MAINTAINING- THE DEFERRAL EXEMPTION FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE. FOR THOSE EARLY AS THAT WOULD. DEMONSTRATE THAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE A CASH HARDSHIP FOR THEM WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR THAT TO FOR ALSO ALL OF THOSE THINGS IN CONTACTS IS WHAT LED US TO- MAINTAIN THAT THAT AMOUNT OF THE FOR ALL THE BUDGET YEAR. I APPRECIATE THAT. BUT I DO DISAGREE JUST BECAUSE I WAS BUDGET CHAIR AT A TIME. WHEN WE WERE UNDER WATER THE WHOLE TIME AND BORROWED A AND IT TOOK GOVERNOR BROWN FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET US OUT OF DEBT. OF BECAUSE SO MUCH HAD BEEN ACCUMULATED AND JUST WHEN WE HAVE THE MOST MONEY THAT WE'VE HAD ABOVE PROJECTIONS IN MODERN TIMES IT'S A TIME TO PAY OFF DEBT. THEN SO- HE YOU KNOW WHAT I. MORGES HEARING THIS WAY MAKING NO DECISION BUT I WOULD JUST ANNOUNCE OUR INTENT TO HAVE IT AS PART OF THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO DO. ARE THERE OTHER QUESTIONS ON ITEM TO OUR- SACRAMENTO. PARDON US SENATOR OCHO BOOK I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT ACTUALLY SHOW THE SAME SENTIMENT THAT YOU DO AS FAR AS PAYING OFF THE DEFERRALS AND PAINT I JUST FINANCIALLY AND EVEN FROM EITHER SIDE HE'S ASSUMING THAT THE DIFFERENT WOULD ONLY BE FOR TOMB I FROM JOHN FROM JUNE TO JULY FROM MONTH BUT SO THAT'S INTEREST THAT'S BEING PAID AND- JUST JUST FINANCIAL LITERACY WOULD TELL YOU THAT. YOU ALWAYS PAY YOUR DEBT FIRST. WE'RE NOT GETTING INTO AN ARGUMENT ABOUT FINANCIAL LITERACY. I'M JUST TEASING I AM JUST DIESEL- I PURCHASED YOUR COMMENTS AND I THINK. OF FINANCES ABOUT BE REALLY HAPPY TO BE RELEASED FROM THE SIDE SO- WOULD THANK AND JUST TO BE CLEAR THAT WAS SORT OF THE REVENUE SIDE AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO TO FIVE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE- EXPENDITURE SIDE SO WE'RE GOING TO GO TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE. WHICH IS THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AND THE. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO INSTRUCTION. ARE WE HAVE- LENA GRANT AND ERIN READ THE- FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WE HAVE MICHAEL R. FERRIS AND KEN COUPON FROM THE L. A. O. AND ELLIE GARNER AGAIN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO WE'LL BEGIN. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CAN GRANT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M GOING TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF OUR LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA FUNDING PROVISION. SO IN THE BUDGET YEAR WE HAVEN'T ME REVISED INCREASE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS OF ONE POINT TWO BILLION. FOR A CUMULATIVE YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE OF THREE POINT TWO BILLION CONSUMER CALLED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE PROVIDED ALMOST TWO BILLION IN POLICY AFFECT THE FUNDING FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS. THIS BRINGS THE- SCHOOL DISTRICT AND CHARTER SCHOOL LCF BACK. TO SIXTY FIVE POINT SIX BILLION. AS FOR THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT WE PROVIDED A COMPOUNDED COLA FOUR POINT OH FIVE PERCENT. BUT THEN WE ALSO ADDED 1% FOR THE L. C. AFFECTS THE CIVICALLY WHICH CREATED AN LC AFFECTS THE CIVIC COMPOUNDED COLA FIVE POINT. SEVEN PERCENT. THIS REFLECTS. ON AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION IN ADDITIONAL BASE GRANT FUNDING. FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AT THE MAY REVISION WOULD PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION FOR A TOTAL YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE OF THIRTY NINE POINT NINE MILLION. THAT'S TEN POINT TWO MILLION AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THEN YOU JUST ON THE REVISION INCREASE. OF TWENTY NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION- WE PROVIDE COST LIVING IS. TO COME OFFICE OF THE- AS THAT EXTRA 1% FOR THE COMPOUNDED COLA FIVE POINT 007% THIS BRINGS TOTAL COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION I'LL SEE IF I FUNDING TO ONE POINT ONE BILLION. I'M ON THE ALSO CONCENTRATION FACTOR INCREASE IT'S AN AGENDA AND MAY WE REVISED ME INCLUDED INCREASE THE LC FIVE CONCENTRATION GRANT BY INCREASING THE CONCENTRATION GRANT RATE FACTOR FROM 50% TO SIXTY FIVE PERCENT. WHICH RESULTS IN THAT ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS I'M GOING PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND INCREASE. JUST AS THEY WERE REMINDERS NOW RECEDED. GRANT AS PART OF L. C. EXPENSE FUNDING WHEN THE ENROLLMENT OF THEIR UNDUPLICATED STUDENTS IS 55% OF THE TOTAL ENROLLMENT OR GREATER. THE PRIOR TO WHAT WE'RE NOW INCLUDING AT THE NEIGHBOR'S VISION A CONCENTRATION GRANT WAS EQUAL MULTIPLIED BY THE ELEAZER PERCENTAGE OF U. P. P. ABOUT TO SIXTY FIVE. WHICH YIELDS AT ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. WE ALSO.A TRAILER LANGUAGE THE REQUIRE THAT ONLY. DEMONSTRATE IN THEIR- CAPS. HOW THIS INCREASE IN FUNDING WILL BE USED TO HIRE ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATED AND CLASSIFIED STAFF ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES THEREBY REDUCING ADULT TO STUDENT RATIOS ON SCHOOL. AS FAR AS INSTRUCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS NEXT SCHOOL YEAR WE PROPOSE TO RETURN TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE AND OF COURSE AS SAFELY AS POSSIBLE. HOWEVER THE MAY REVISION DOES MAKE SOME CHANGES TO THE EXISTING INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAMS- TO GIVE UP AT LEAST THE OPTION TO GENERATE STATE FUNDING BY SERVING STUDENTS. OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM- IN RESPONSE TO PARENT REQUESTS. EXACTLY IS WILL PROVIDE NON CLASSROOM BASED INSTRUCTION USING THE EXIST EXISTING TRADITIONAL INDEPENDENT STUDY MODEL. BUT WILL ALSO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS LIKE PROVIDING ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY INTERNET CONNECTIVITY AND A DEDICATED AND RIGOROUS CURRICULUM THE ALSO BE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A FRAMEWORK OF TEAR DURING GAUGE WENT TO THE STUDENTS THAT ARE NOT MEANINGFULLY PARTICIPATING AND INSTRUCTION. WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO TRACK AND RECORD DAILY STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN OUR AND INTERACTION WITH STUDENTS WITH TEACHERS. FINALLY ON THE EXPANDED LEARNING TIME PROPOSAL REVISION PROVIDES ONE BILLION IN PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FOR EXPANDED LEARNING TIME. ON THIS PROPOSAL REFLECTS A FIVE YEAR PLAN TO IMPLEMENT EXPANDED DAY FULL YEAR INSTRUCTION AND ENRICHMENT FOR ALL STUDENTS IN GRADES KINDERGARTEN THROUGH GRADE SIX. AN ALLEY IS THAT RECEIVED THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATIONS OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE NOT REPRESENTS AROUND TWO MILLION STUDENTS. ON WITH THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM BY THE YEAR TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX THE STUDENTS WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO NO COST AFTER SCHOOL AND SUMMER PROGRAMS. WHEN COMBINED WITH REGULAR INSTRUCTIONAL TIME THIS WOULDGIVE STUDENTS NINE HOURS OF DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE ACADEMICS AND ENRICHMENT FOR INSTRUCTIONAL DAY AND FOR SIX WEEKS EACH SUMMER- ELEAZAR WILL BE REQUIRED TO EXTEND INSTRUCTIONAL TIME BUT THEY CAN PROVIDE ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES DURING THESE EXPANDED HOURS. SO IN TERMS OF RECEIVING THESE FUNDS- ALTHOUGH LEN WOULD RECEIVE THE FUNDS AS A RESULT OF BEING ELIGIBLE FOR THE LCF CONCENTRATION GRANT THE EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAM HAS TO BE PROVIDED TO ALL STUDENTS WHO WISH TO ATTEND SO. THEY EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAM WOULD SERVE ALL STUDENTS AND NOT JUST THE CONCENTRATION GRANT GENERATING STUDENTS AT THAT SCHOOL. THAT'S ALREADY MENTIONED- THE PROGRAM IS FUNDED WITH ONE BILLION ONGOING PROP NINETY EIGHT TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND CHRIS TO FIVE BILLION EXPORT FULL IMPLEMENTATION BY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. OVER THIS IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD THE SERVICES WOULD BE PHASED IN SO THOSE ELLIE IT'S THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF STUDENTS. FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND FOSTER USED WOULD BE PROVIDED THAT. ACCESS TO THAT EXTENDED DAYS LAST YEAR PROGRAMING FIRST. FINALLY ONCE FULLY IMPLEMENTED- DID MINISTRATION PROPOSES INCORPORATING THESE FUNDS INTO THE LCF CONCENTRATION GRANT CALCULATION. AND I THINK WE'LL HOLD QUESTIONS UNTIL THIS- MY COLLEAGUE- PRESENTS FOR PORTION- I HEADED OFF TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FINANCE FOLLOW UP ON A SHARED TANK AND SHALL SPEAK ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY FUNDING OR AN IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. GREAT WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU IN THAT GOOD MORNING CHEN MEMBERS- I WON'T ADD MY COMMENTS ABOUT THAT THE PROPOSAL IN ISSUE FOUR SO I WELL- YUP MY TIME AT A TIME. OKAY. BUT THEN WE WILL MOVE TO THE LA ON. MORNING MR TRIMMER'S MICHAEL FERRIS WITH THE ILLEGAL A FULL WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH PROVIDING THE HIGHER COMPOUNDED COLA A FIVE POINT 007% OVER THE ONE POINT SEVEN PERCENT- STATUTORY COLA. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO PROVIDE MORE I'M GOING FUNDING TO SCHOOLS SCHOOL DISTRICTS PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO CFS VISIBLE WAY TO DO THAT AS A BENEFITS ALL DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE SOME WITH LOOKS ABILITY. THE PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE CONCENTRATION GRANT TO REDUCE ADULT TO STUDENT RATIOS. WE THINK THAT THE PROPOSAL IS REASONABLE AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF THE CFS. PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO DISTRICTS WITH HIGHER PROPORTIONS OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS FOSTER YOUTH IN ENGLISH LEARNERS. HELPS ENSURE DISTRICTS CAN INCREASE FROM CRUISE SERVICES THAT'S SUPPORT STUDENT LEARNING AND WELL BEING. THE PROPOSAL WOULD GIVE CHECKS ABILITY FOR DISTRICTS ASIDE HOW DOES THE BEST BEST ADDRESS STUDENTS NEEDS- LESLIE OR- SORRY- IN REGARDS TO THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO INSTRUCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS BUT WE JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO REVIEW THE RECENTLY RE. RELEASED LANGUAGE AROUND THE INDEPENDENT CITIES PROGRAM BUT HAVE NO COMMENTS AT THIS TIME ON THE PROPOSAL. I'LL GO AHEAD AND DISCUSS OUR COMMENTS ON THE EXPANDED LEARNING GROUP OPPOSES SINCE THAT WAS COVERED BY OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE FINANCE- WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER THE TRADE OFFS OF RESTRICTING THE PROPOSED FUNDING FOR EXPANDED LEARNING- S. ACCESS TO. SUMMER AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS CAN PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENGAGING ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL DAY. AND PROVIDED THOSE REVISION FOR CHILDREN WITH PARENTS WORKING TRADITIONAL HOURS. ALTERNATIVELY THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER PROVIDING FUNDING THROUGH A CFS BUT GIVING DISTRICTS FLEXIBILITY TO SPEND FUNDS ON ACTIVITIES THEY THINK WILL BEST ADDRESS OUR STUDENTS NEEDS WHICH COULD INCLUDE. SUMMER AND SCHOOL AT AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO TARGET FUNDING TO OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD BENEFIT STUDENTS WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS SUCH AS EXTENDING THE SCHOOL YEAR PROVIDING INTENSIVE TUTORING OR OTHER STUDENTS COURTS. ATTACK INCLUDES OUR MARKS- I CALL THE CAN COUPON AND I ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THEN WE'RE. GOING TO MOVE ON TO- L. A. FOR THE- OF PAGE. THANK YOU CHARLIE GARNER ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND WE ARE THANKFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR CONTINUES TO MAKE EDUCATION A TOP PRIORITY IN THIS BUDGET AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO FINALIZE ANY OF THE PROPOSALS. AS LEGAL WAY TO SUPPORT OUR CHILDREN WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU. I THINK THIS THOMAS START WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO EITHER OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE QUESTIONS ON THE SIDE OF. OKAY CENTERMAN- AND YOUR MARK. SO I GUESS- MY FIRST QUESTION A COMMENT ACTUALLY THIS IS MORE OF A COMMENT IS JUST AROUND THE HOLD HARMLESS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR. AND I WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE- WHILE I BELIEVE THAT IT IS SAFE TO RESUME PHYSICAL INSTRUCTIONS AT THIS POINT BARRING ANY SETS MAJOR SETBACKS. AND WHILE I PLAN TO SEND MY KIDS TO SCHOOL. AND I WELL I THINK IT IS AN ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT THAT. EVERY L. EA AND EVERY SCHOOL ACROSS THE STATE OFFER PHYSICAL IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AS THE DEFAULT. STARTING THIS FALL. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION IS IMPORTANT FOR OFFERING. VIRTUAL INSTRUCTION TO THOSE PARENTS WHO MAY. NOT FEEL THAT THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE RISKS OF SENDING THEIR KIDS BACK TO PHYSICAL CLASSROOM AND I WOULD NOTE THAT WHEN I TALKED TO I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH ABOUT THIS BUT WHEN I TALKED. A TRUSTED ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS THAT'S WHAT I'M TOLD IS THAT WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DATA YET TO MAKE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN PROCLAMATIONS ABOUT SCHOOL RE OPENINGS. MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT IT'S SAFE TO SEND OUR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL BUT THE BUT THE CERTAINTY AROUND THAT IS NOT A POINT. ARKANSAS I WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE THAT THERE ARE PARENTS OUT THERE. THAT DAY FOR WHATEVER REASON THEIR OWN FULLER MEDICAL VULNERABILITIES OR OR WHATNOT ARE NOT COMFORTABLE SAYING THE KIDS BACK TO PHYSICAL CLASSROOMS- ANIES ARE NOT IRRATIONAL PEOPLE THAT THE FALL YOU KNOW ON ONE END OF THE RANGE OF BELIEFS OUT THERE- BUT BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE WE SHOULD FORCE THOSE PARENTS TO SEND THEIR KIDS BACK TO PHYSICAL. CLASSROOMS AND SO I WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT THIS HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS IMPORTANT AND I WANT. TO ST MY STATE MY STRONG SUPPORT FOR IT- MY SAID. I GUESS MY ACTUAL CLASS AND I'LL PROBABLY **** ON THE NEXT PANEL WELL- BUT EITHER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR THE PERMIT. YOU KNOW WE SEEM TO BE PUSHING A LOT OF MONEY TOWARDS HELPING SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF- LOW INCOME ENGLISH LEARNER AND FOSTER CHILDREN AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY BUT I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IT IS. HAVE YOU GUYS CALCULATED WHAT THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ALL THIS IS BECAUSE AT SOME POINT WE ALSO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING FOR THEIR BASIC NEEDS. AND WHEN I SEE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS STACKED ON TOP OF PROGRAMS THAT ALREADY EXIST TO TOE SPECIFICALLY ALLOCATE FUNDS TO THESE THESE PARTICULAR ALLEY AS- OR SCHOOLS BOB I GUESS THAT MAKES ME WONDER SIR WHAT WHAT'S THE TOTAL AMOUNT THAT THAT THIS IS A 75% CONCENTRATION SCHOOL MIGHT GET THESE A V. A SCHOOL THAT HAS FORTY NINE PERCENT- AND HOW ARE WE LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE ON THE TALKING ABOUT THE NEEDS OF OUR SCHOOLS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW SCHOOLS THEY HAVE 40% 49% LOW INCOME FOSTER KIDS ENGLISH LEARNERS MANY OF THEM ARE STRUGGLING WITH RESOURCES AS WELL AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE. THAT WE'RE ALLOCATING FUNDS FAIRLY HERE. AS SO WE ARE GOING TO CREATE A PERMANENT FINANCE THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION- WE DO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL. 1% BECAUSE THIS IS A- DIFFICULT FOR. THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA SO THAT- EVEN THOUGH THATGOES TO THE BASE GRANTS. WHICH PROVIDE FUNDING FOR ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS- IT ALSO- PROVIDES AN EXTRA BUMP TO THE CONCENTRATION AND SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS. SO THOSE THAT POPULATION THAT REFER TO IF WE SPECIFICALLY TARGET OUR POPULATION. AS WELL AS OUR ONE POINT ONE BILLION. DOLLAR CONCENTRATION GRANT SPECIFIC INCREASE- WE INCREASE THAT THRESHOLD FROM 5265% WHICH- RESULTS NOT ONE POINT ONE BILLION SO. WE TRY TO. TO PROVIDE THIS EXTRA FUNDING THROUGH EXISTING CHANNELS AND NOT CREATE NEW PROGRAMMING NECESSARILY. WHEN IT COMES TO THIS DISTURBING THIS POPULATION. YEAH I GUESS I GUESS MAYBE I DIDN'T STATE MY QUESTION CLEARLY SO I APOLOGIZE. I GUESS I'M JUST WONDERING YOU KNOW BETWEEN THIS. CONCENTRATION FACTOR INCREASED ONE POINT ONE BILLION. YOU'VE GOT- I THINK IN THE NEXT PANEL YOU'LL TALK ABOUT- YES SANDY. LEARNING TIME PROGRAM IN SOME OF YOUR OTHER- EFFORTS AND AGAIN I WANT TO SAY I'VE FOUGHT THE GOAL LIKE KNOW WHAT WHEN WE- LOWER INCOMES. AND LEARNERS THE DAY THEY DO NEED EXTRA ATTENTION BUT IN THE BIG PICTURE IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE PUTTING A LOT OF MONEY THERE AND MAYBE NOT AS MUCH AS WE COULD BE TO ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND I GUESS I'M JUST ASKING ON AGGREGATE LEVEL HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN LOOKING AT HOW MUCH FUNDING. IN TOTAL YOU'RE YOU'RE PUSHING TO- YOUR THESE HIGHER CONCENTRATION SCHOOLS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EXACT TERM IS OBVIOUSLY JUST THE BASELINE. THOSE CENTER MAN IF I COULD JUMP IN HERE AND AT AND APARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD- I THINK I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION BETTER HERE THAN THAN THE FIRST TIME SO- I WOULD POINT LIKE MY COLLEAGUE LENA MENTION TO. WE ESTIMATE THAT THAT ADDITIONAL 1% COLA THEY WERE PROPOSING AND I'LL SEE I I'VE ONLY WHICH BENEFITS ALL DISTRICTS EVEN THOSE THAT WOULDN'T RECEIVE. BROWN'S FUNDING AS WELL AS THOSE WHO DO LIKE SHE MENTIONED- TO BE WORTH ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YOU'RE A LOAN- TO THE THAT'S THE BOTTOM TO THE BASE FRANCE OR EVERYONE WOULD FEEL THAT THAT. ADDITIONAL INCREASE AS WELL AS WE ESTIMATE ABOUT ANOTHER HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION GRANTS AMOUNT. OUNCE FOR EVERYBODY THAT THAT DOES RECEIVE. THOSE AND THEN I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WITH THE MAY REVISION PROPOSAL- THERE IS MORE THAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW ONGOING IN THE MONEY AND I'LL SEE IF I FUNDING THAT WE'RE PROPOSING OVER THE CURRENT YEAR LEVELS AND IF YOU TAKE A LOOK BACK ALL THE WAY BACK I DON'T KNOW IT'S A LONG TIME AGO BUT SO THE FIRST YEAR BILL CFF IN THIRTEEN FOURTEEN- THE STARTING POINT THERE WAS ABOUT FORTY BILLION DOLLARS SO WITH THE MAY REVISION NOW. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AROUND TWENTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OF NEW FUNDING FOR LC ABOUT NOW YES SOME OF THAT A GOOD PORTION OF IT HAS GONE OUT- VIA THE SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION GRANTS BUT THE BOWL THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT HAS BEEN THE OF THE BASE FRANCE AS WELL SO EVERYONE HAS BENEFITED ALL ALL DISTRICTS ALL STUDENTS- AND THEN I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WITH THE UPCOMING NINETEEN TEN DEMOCRATS AND ALL THE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE DISTRICTS HAS RECEIVED. THOSE BILLIONS UPON BILLIONS WERE DOLED OUT LARGELY BASED ON TITLE ONE- TITLE ONE ENTITLEMENTS AND SO YOU HAVE. DISTRICTS THAT DON'T EVEN. CONSTANT UNDER I'LL SEE IF AFTER THAT MAY HAVE HAD LARGE SHARES ABOUT THE SOLAR AS- AS WELL AS THOSE WHO DO GET CONCENTRATE GRANT- FINDING. AND THEN. ALSO A SEVERAL OF OUR ONE TIME PROPOSALS GO OUT BASED ON- ON LEDS PROPORTION OF OVERALL LCS FAST AND SO THAT WOULD ALSO APPLY TO THOSE WHO. WHETHER THEY HAVE CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDING THAT THEY RECEIVE FROM US YOU FELT. OR NOT YEAH- AND ADDITIONAL FUNDS LIKE MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED ABOUT EXPANDED LEARNING TIME WHICH WE WILL TALK ABOUT LATER ON IS TIED TO AN ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO INCREASE- FOR THOSE ELEAZAR RECEIVE THE FUNDING SPECIFICALLY TO INCREASE NON INSTRUCTIONAL TIME LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS THE CONCENTRATION BROWN FUNDING INCREASE OF ONE POINT ONE BILLION. IS SPECIFICALLY TO BE TIED TO DEMONSTRATING HOW AN ELLIOTT RECEIVED THOSE THAT INCREASE WOULD BE REDUCING ADULT STUDENT RATIOS ON THEIR CAMPUSES IN THOSE OTHER ELLIE AS THAT WOULD RECEIVE THAT MONEY WOULDN'T HAVE NOT SEEN REQUIREMENTS SO- IN IN ARGUE THAT'S WHERE THAT. KIND OF EQUITY BILITY OF IT COMES IN AND WE ALL SUPPORT EQUITY AND WANT TO SEE BETTER EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES I GUESS MY QUESTION JUST OR MAYBE IT'S MORE A STATEMENT AT THIS POINT. IS THAT IF I'VE GOT NUMBER SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAT HAVE LIKE 49% GET ZERO AND YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THE 1% CALL IT WAS A FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE. IN YOUR PROVIDING AS I IF I'M READING THIS CORRECTLY ONE POINT ONE BILLION AN ONGOING FROM NINETY FUNDING. OFFERED THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH THE 65% CONCENTRATION- WHICH YOU KNOW IT LEAVES A LOT OF SCHOOLS OUT WITH YOU KNOW A LOT LESS AND I GUESS. YOU KNOW I DON'T YOU GUYS LOOK AT THE NUMBERS MORE CLOSELY THAN I EVER WILL BUT- YOU KNOW WHEN I LOOK AT THIS IS ONE POINT ONE BILLION FOR THOSE WITH 65% PLUS. BUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE 45% OR 55% CONCENTRATIONS ONLY GET TACKLE INCREASE AND YOU COULD CERTAINLY CHANGE UP THE PRIORITIES HERE TO JUST INCREASE THE BASE FUNDING LITTLE BIT MORE. AND MAYBE PROVIDE LESS MONEY SO I GUESS I'M REALLY JUST LOOKING FOR THE JUSTIFICATION HOW MUCH OF THIS IS NEEDED AS WORK THINKING ABOUT THE BROADER BIG PICTURE BUT- I DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP TOO MUCH TIME SO. JUST LEAVE IT WITH THAT STATEMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU- SENATOR AND IT AND DO TALKED ABOUT TWO TOP. ARM TO TALK. IT N. HE DID A GOOD. BUT LET ME JUST S. FINANCE MAYBE ASTOR CONCENTRATION GRANT QUESTION A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY. WHICH IS AWESOME- WHY IS ADDITIONAL STAFFING TIED TO THE CONSERVATION I MEAN THE CONCENTRATION GRANT DIVISIONAL STAFF IS NEEDED WHY NOT CREATE A SEPARATE PROGRAM AND TARGET STAFF TO SPECIFIC SCHOOLS OR FOR SPECIFIC NEEDS. SO CHANGE YOUR QUESTION CENTER WHERE I THINK OUR THINKING WITH OUR PROPOSAL IS THAT- THE L. CAP IS ALREADY PART OF THE LCS PFAFF IN THE LOCAL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS MAKING SURE THE ELEAZAR ARE REALLY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY NEEDS THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS. AND SOME BY FOLDING THIS FUNDING INTO THE ALSO HAVE A CONCENTRATION GRANT IN KEY INCREASE FOR THOSE SCHOOLS WITH THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF SAID HIGH NEED STUDENTS- WE'RE TYING IT INTO THAT EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE ALL CAP NOT CREATING SO YET ANOTHER- SILO TO PROGRAM OUTSIDE OF THE L. C. F. ASK. THAT NOW DISTRICTS ARE HAVING TO COMPLY WITH WE FELT THAT ROLLING IT INTO THE LCF I'VE REALLY MAKES IT MOST CONSISTENT WITH OF COURSE THE IMAGES OF LOCAL CONTROL ETCETERA- SO THAT DISTRICTS THAT RECEIVE THIS FUNDING. ARE ABLE TO- REALLY BETTER ALIGNED WITH ALL THEIR OLD ARCHING L. PER. AND HAVE A LIVE SOME ELSE OF THAT WELL. I APPRECIATE THAT IT THE SAME TIME. IT MEANS THAT SCHOOLS THAT MIGHT HAVE A NEED- OUTSIDE OF IT BECAUSE IT IS JUST TARGETED TO THE EXISTING STRUCTURE AND I GET TO DECIDE WHAT WAS BEST A BUT I THINK THAT'S- THAT'S THE PROBLEM AND MAYBE WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. I THINK THE THIS ITEM R. A. I WANT TO ASK THE AND ALSO A LITTLE TOO TO WHAT SENATOR MEN SAID ABOUT SCHOOL RE OPENING BECAUSE- AND- JUST AS A COMMENT BECAUSE I READ THE EXCHANGE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A FALSE CHOICE. A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER- WHAT IS PROPOSED WOULD ALLOW 90% OF STUDENTS NOT TO COME BACK IN SOME DISTRICT AND I THINK THAT'S THE WORST FEARS. OF SOME PEOPLE THAT WANT SCHOOLS TO COME BACK IN PERSON AND YET THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SUGGESTING ANYWHERE THAT 90% OF THE STUDENTS IN ANY DISTRICT WON'T COME BACK. I THINK IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE. THAT THERE ARE SOME PLACES AND THERE'S A STORY I THINK AT THIS MORNING'S LA TIMES IT'S IN THE NEWS THIS MORNING ABOUT PICO RIVERA. AND THE LOS THEY HAD THEIR- MUCH COVETED AND THE FACT THAT PEOPLE AREN'T READY. SOME TO COME BACK PERSONALLY DOING IT BECAUSE OF THAT. AND WE SHOULD NOT DRIVE THOSE PARENTS OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO FUND THE LOSS OF ENROLLMENT OTHER SCHOOLS AND SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. AND I THINK WHAT THE DETAILS STILL HAVE TO BE TALKED ABOUT. THE NOTION THAT THERE'S A REQUIREMENT THAT PEOPLE COME BACK BUT THE OPTION. IF PEOPLE COME BACK AND NOT IN PERSON IS STILL REQUIREMENT FOR INDEPENDENT STUDY AND IT'S STILL MONITORED AND YOU CAN STILL DEAL WITH ADA. IS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT AND WE SHOULD NOT BE DRIVING PEOPLE ON THE MARGINS OUT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AFTER THIS HAPPENED SO. WHILE THERE MIGHT BE SOME THE DETAILS TO STILL TALK ABOUT I THINK THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE BUDGET. TO ALLOW FOR INDEPENDENT STUDIES AND THAT IS A GOOD ONE AND SO WE SHOULD JUST WORK THAT OUT. AND THEN A MORE GLOBAL COMMENT BECAUSE EVERYTHING FITS TOGETHER HERE. WE HAVE ONE ITEM. ABOUT SPECIAL OF PROGRAMS THAT'S THAT STILL TO COME. AND. SOME OF THEM ARE TO BE STOOD UP. IN WHO THE MONEY ON THE RECALL REPORTING ON DISTRICTS THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THEY CAN GET THE MOP. BOB BARR IN TIME WHEN THERE'S A ONE TIME MONEY AND WE WANT TO SPEND IT- BEFORE. THE REQUIREMENTS PARTICULAR ON THE FEDERAL MONEY THAT THAT MIGHT LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO BE SPENT OVERTIME. AND SO EVEN THOUGH THAT'S A CONVERSATION TO HAVE ABOUT THEIR IT RAISES THE ISSUES ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT THE BUDGET FOR. R. ELIA IS FOR EXAMPLE. EITHER A FURTHER PAYMENT TOWARD PENSION COSTS. FOR A PAYMENT TOWARD SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS WHICH UNIVERSALLY PEOPLE FEEL LIGHT UP- CARD ISSUED FUNDING THE BUDGET AND IF WE ARE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING MONEY OUT THE DOOR IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO PUT SOME OF IT TOWARD THOSE TWO THINGS IN THIS. AND WHILE THAT MIGHT BE BETTER SET IN OTHER ITEMS THESE ALL FIT TOGETHER AND I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST RACES HERE AND JUST SAY THAT THAT IN WHATEVER CONVERSATION WE HAVE ABOUT THIS AND THE REMAINING ITEMS ON THE EXPENDITURE SIDE. WE JUST BELIEVE THOSE NEED TO BE ON THE TABLE AS WELL IN THE DISCUSSIONS OF ALL THE GIVES AND TAKES THE THAT ARE ABOUT TO COME AND SO I WOULD SUGGEST MAKE THOSE COMMENTS BECAUSE- THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS ARE GOING TO BE REAL CONVERSATIONS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE HEAR THESE TO WEIGH THE ISSUES. ON THE TABLE SO THAT NOBODY'S SURPRISED ABOUT WHERE THE DISCUSSION GOES ARM ANY COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ADDITIONALLY BEFORE WE LEAVE THIS ITEM. THEN LET ME THANK OUR PANELISTS- SHADED IN LIMITED KNOWLEDGE. ONCE AGAIN THAT COMING FROM THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION WHERE IF YOU OVER USED ACRONYMS SHE WENT TO PRISON- THAT LAST DISCUSSION WAS DIFFICULT FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT MIGHT NOT BE TOTALLY SCHOOLED. IN THE SUBJECT AND- HE YOU KNOW WE ARE THIS IS ALSO PUBLIC EDUCATION SO I APOLOGIZE WILL TRY TO BRING PEOPLE ALONG ISSUE FOR A STUDENT SUPPORT PROPOSALS AND- OUR PANELISTS. THE FIRST FOUR NINE SUSPECTS ARM NOT ALL BE SPEAKING BUT WILL LET THEM DO IT WIENER GRANT PAULA FINASTRA TANG AGAIN LIST MY AND AMBER ALEXANDER. AGAIN MICHAEL R.

ARE SET FOR THE SUPPORT SCHOOLS WILL RECEIVE. OF THE MAY RIVER PROPOSES. INCREASE IN FUNDING THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER PROVIDING SMALLER MODEL FUNDING INITIALLY. BY ADDING FUNDING IN FUTURE YEARS IF DEMAND IS HIGH. OF LESLIE WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE TWO PROPOSALS FOR TARGETED INTERVENTIONS AND HEALTHY AND SAFETY ACTIVITIES. SCHOOLS HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED MORE THAN THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS DURING LOS AND IMPROVE HEALTH AND SAFETY. MORE THAN TWENTY BILLION FOUR BILLION O THAT IS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND MORE THAN SIX BILLION IS FROM THE STATE. OF THESE FUNDS DISTRICTS HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT ALL OF THIS IS SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS. INCLUDING TARGETED INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS HIGH DOSE TOURING AND ACTIVITIES TO REOPEN SCHOOLS. ACTIVITIES WITH NO CLEAR JUSTIFICATION AS WHEN WE'VE SPOKEN TO DISTRICTS THEY'VE INDICATED THAT THEY HAVE NOT SPENT ALL OF THE ONE TIME FUNDS IT PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED PRAISE ACTIVITIES. AND ALTHOUGH DISTRICTS FACE VARIOUS CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPENING SCHOOLS AND ADDRESSING LEARNING LOSS. IS CHALLENGES DID NOT APPEAR TO STEM FROM THE LACK OF FUNDING. A SECOND CLSE MY REMARKS ACCESS OR ANY QUESTIONS APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE COMMENTS THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO ELLIE GARDNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. HM NUMBER IS ALLIE GARNER ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND MANY OF THE PROPOSALS IN THE MAY REVISION ALIGNED WITH THE SHARED GOALS OF THE S. P. I. ENSURING EQUITABLE EDUCATION FOR ALL STUDENTS AND PRACTICING ON STUDENTS HAD HARNESSED DURING THIS PANDEMIC OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND OUR TOLL LANGUAGE LEARNERS. EXPANDING ACCESS TO THE AFTER SCHOOL AND SUMMER LEARNING PROGRAMS SUPPORTING COMMUNITY SCHOOLS THAT PROVIDE WRAP AROUND SERVICES AND ENSURING OUR STUDENTS CAN SAFELY RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM ARE ALL CRITICAL PIECES OF THIS PUZZLE WE WOULD NOTE THOUGH FOR THE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION HEALTH AND SAFETY GRANT. THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS APPROPRIATED. DOT NET. AS OPERATED ON DOES NOT IN THE STATE'S SCHOOL INSTEAD AT THE IS THE OBJECT YOU NEEDED ELIGIBLE LOCAL I. T. EACH NEEDS DOES COUNTY ALL OF EDUCATION OR CLASSROOM BASED DIRECT KIND OF CHARTER SCHOOL CD WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT SOME AMOUNT. SHOULD LIKELY BE APPROPRIATED FOR STATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS CD NOTES THAT MUCH OF THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS TARGET ON GETTING AND KEEPING SCHOOLS OPEN INCLUDING THE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION PORTION EIGHTY EIGHTY SIX IT WAS PASSED EARLIER THIS YEAR. BUT AGAIN THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE STATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS AS SUCH THE CD REQUEST OF THE LEGISLATURE. LET LEGISLATURE KEEP STATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS IN MIND WHEN PROPOSALS. ABOUT ALL OF THESE GRANTS SO THAT WE ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS. IN THE STATE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SAFELY RETURN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. WELL THESE PROPOSAL WITHIN THE SECTION IS DESERVING OF FULL PANEL IN ANOTHER ITSELF I WILL AND I REMARKS THERE TO KEEP THINGS BRIEF. I HAVE WITH ME MULTIPLE CITY STAFF WHO ARE EXPERTS IN EACH OF THESE AREAS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M GONNA LEAD WITH TWO QUESTIONS HERE. IN ONE IS FOR OF FINANCE AND IT'S IS IT FOLLOWS UP ON THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S COMMENT ON THE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND TARGETED INTERVENTION GRANTS ARE GIVEN THAT- LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES ARE RECEIVING THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE FUNDS FOR THE SAME PURPOSES ON HOW DID THE ADMINISTRATION DETERMINED THAT MORE FUNDS WERE NEEDED FOR THIS PURPOSE. AIRPARK CHECKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I BELIEVE I CAN NOT THAT THAT TWO BILLION IN THE PROPOSAL FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY SUPPLEMENT WITH YOUR BILLION AND EIGHTY EIGHTY SIX PACKAGE FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY EFFORT. THE FUNDING AND EIGHTY EIGHTY EIGHTY EIGHTY THANKS OR THE BAGGAGE COVER COSTS EVERY OPENING IN THE CURRENT YEAR I THANK THEM FOR THEY'RE FINDING REMAINING COST TO BE CARRIED OVER INTO THE NEXT YEAR. THE TWO BILLION IN THE MAYOR REVIVED BY HEALTH AND SAFETY IN COMPETITIVE FOCUS ON HELPING SCHOOLS CONTINUE AFRICA OFFER IN PERSON INSTRUCTION BY PROVIDING DEDICATED FUNDS AVAILABLE OVER TWO YEARS. I DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WILL BE AN INCREASED COST AROUND CLEANING AND HAVE FINALLY SENT ANOTHER HOW THE BABY NEEDS AT WORK WITH BACK IN THE FALL AND CRACKED. WE ALSO HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO. THAT UNLIKELY THAT THERE BE A VACCINE AVAILABLE TOO MANY. AND FALL AND MANY TACKLE CONCERNS ABOUT THE THEIR CHOI BACK SCHOOL. WE WANTED TO PROVIDE GLOBAL THE REFI. NEEDED TO BE STATE. ERICA CAL STATE STOP AND GO. SPENDING A- TO. AND A TWO BILLION COULD BE USED FOR SCHOOL TO HOLD. AND I OF AND THAT THE VARIETY PURPOSES INCLUDING BACK BEING CLINIC LOOKING BACK TO COMFORTABLE. AND ALSO PROTECT. ABOUT WHEN. THE LAST THING I WANT TO KNOW IS THAT BOTH OF THAT IN A PROPOSAL THAT I WITH THE- IS THAT AS MAJORITY OF I DON'T. FIND THAT HAVE BEEN COMING WENT OUT BASED ON PROPORTION OF TITLE ALEX. THE COULD NOT GO OUT TO ALL WE GAVE. THE FUNDING FOR PROPOSAL. DOC LEN ON ALTHEA THOUSAND TITLE MEANT. FOR THE INTENTION OF THAT THE PEOPLE. AND THAT PEOPLE HOUSES AND LONG THAT I BINDING AND TARGET IN A- BROWN WILL BE SPREAD OUT MORE. ACROSS WITH. ALL OUT. ACTUALLY NEED TO GO FOR THAT SO I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION IS ON THE EXPANDED LEARNING TIME. AND I JUST HAVE TO SAY BUREAUCRATICALLY WHEN YOU READ THIS. R. IT HAS A CUT OFF OF A 55% ENROLLMENT FOR LOW INCOME ENGLISH LEARNERS AND FOSTER YOUTH THAT WOULDN'T GET. ANY FUNDING TO PROVIDE THE EXPANDED LEARNING TIME FOR STUDENTS. AND IT JUST SEEMS CRAZY TO ME THAT WE WOULD FUNDED PROGRAM ANELLI A WITH FIFTY FOUR PERCENT. OF YOUR WITH REGARD TO LOW INCOME ENGLISH LEARNERS AND FOSTER USE WOULD SAY OH YOU DON'T GET FUNDED. ISN'T THERE SOME BETTER WAY THAT THERE'S NOT SUCH AN ARBITRARY CUT OFF I MEAN SCREENING OUT SOMEBODY THAT AS DOESN'T SEEM PRODUCTIVE. AND I WOULD DIRECT THAT TO THE L. A. ALL. RAIMES I I'M SORRY MATTE FOR FINANCE BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT DE LA- WHO'S JUST SCRAMBLING THERE WILL WILL HAVE A CONTACT. IF I COULD HAVE MY UNCLE A- BRAWL AS TO THE QUESTION SURE. BRAWL WITH THE MATERIAL IF IT DIDN'T TO THE SUPERBOWL I THINK MILLION. HAS INDICATED THAT THE INTENT IS TO PHASE THE PROGRAM OVER SEVERAL YEARS. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY THINGS WHICH WITH BEIJING THE PROGRAM MORE TIME HOW I WOULD LOOK I WOULD AFFECT WHAT WHAT WOULD. YOU SAY FIVE YEARS FROM NOW. IN TERMS OF OUR GENERAL- OFF ON THE ON THE PROGRAM WE BIG. MONEY FROM ADDITIONAL FUNDING OVERALL BIG PICTURE BIGGER THINGS- ON THE THIRD DISTRICTS OF HIRING COULD BE WE'VE GOT WAS REASONABLE ARE BY. DID YOUR POINT REGARDING THE ARE THE POTENTIAL CLINICAL IS ALREADY VERY GOOD SORT OF ARBITRAGE PROFITS I THINK I WOULD NOT CHOOSE. IN THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE CONCENTRATION GRANT PARK ROAD NOTE THAT THE CONGRESS BRACKETS DID NOT CREATE THAT ARBITRARY CUTOFF. IF YOU ARE A FIFTY FIVE OR 56% R. O. U. B. V. SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU GET CONCENTRATION FUNDING BUT IT'S VERY VERY SMALL OVER TIME THAT WILL MAKE IT BIGGER SO WE DON'T HAVE THE SME PASSWORD ARBITRATE COOP IN THE CORNER ON THE LEFT ARM- WE DO OUR- YOUR POINTS ARE NOT CREATING SOME- LINE WHERE. I. ONE POINT. DO YOU CAN YOU GET THIS FUNNY IT OUT OF YOU WOULDN'T. DEGREE FROM JOHNSON WE DO KNOW THERE ARE TWO LARGE PIECES CAL OUR AROUND. WILL FINANCE YOU HAVE A. WE'LL WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS EXPANDED LEARNING TIME NOT REPRESENTS ROUGHLY TWO MILLION STUDENT CHILDREN HAD FULL IMPLEMENTATION SO WE DON'T SEE THIS AS- REALLY. YOU KNOW I'M VERY SELECTIVE KIND OF SMALL POPULATION OF CONCENTRATION GREAT GENERATING SCHOOLS- THAT POPULATION IS QUITE LARGE IN THE STATE AND- WE WERE JUST SPEAKING TO- IMPROVE THE TARGET THAT SPECIFIC POPULATION BUT REALLY. THAT FUNDING IS SPREAD OUT TO ALL STUDENTS AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT THAT GENERATE THAT CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDING. AND IF AND THIS IS JESSICA HOLMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF I MAY ADD ON TO MY COLLEAGUES GO AHEAD. THANK YOU SO- I THINK TOO THAT THAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF ROLLING THIS PROPOSAL OUT AS WE'RE LOOKING AT A FIVE YEAR TIMELINE I THINK IT TO THE EXTENT WE HAD- UNLIMITED FUNDS- AND LIMITED TIME- WE WOULD. HAVE TO BE TALKING ABOUT PROVIDING THIS AT THESE FUNDS AND WORK THIS REQUIREMENT TO ALL SCHOOLS. AND THIS WAS THE CHUNK THAT WE FELT LIKE WE CAN BREAK OFF- AND THIS WAS THE POPULATION THAT WE WANTED TO START WITH IN TERMS OF ROLLING THIS OUT I WOULD NOTE THAT OUR CURRENT AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM ASUS IS MEANS TESTED PROGRAM AS WELL- AND PROVIDES FUNDS FOR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND SUMMER SCHOOL PROGRAMMING- FOR ELEAZAR THE HIGHEST PROPORTIONS OF FREE REDUCED PRICE MEALS. SO REALLY BUILDING OFF OF THAT- AND YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE STARTING NOW AND WHERE WE'RE SEEING OURSELVES GO AND SORT OF THIS NEXT FIVE YEAR TIME HORIZON THAT'S WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ONCE. NOTE THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE PUT INTO PLACE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO EXPAND TO COVER ALL ON STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE AND ALL ELEAZAR BUT THIS IS WHERE WE'RE STARTING FROM- AND THIS IS THAT THIS IS THE PROPOSAL WE'RE TRYING TO KIND OF. START THIS PROCESS OF ROLLING. IT OUT AND FOCUSING ON THESE KIDS FIRST. AND LET ME JUST MAKE A COMMON BECAUSE- OUR- I THINK YOU YOUR QUEST. ARE ADVOCATE FOR WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING BUT STILL DON'T TOTALLY ADDRESSED THE QUESTION BECAUSE- IT'S- IT'S WELL WE WILL LIMITED MONEY AND WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH ALL THE PEOPLE. THAT ARE ENTIRELY IN THE SCHOOL BUT IF YOU HAVE 54% OF THESE CHALLENGING. OUR POPULATIONS YOU DON'T GET IN THE DOOR AND THERE MIGHT BE A BETTER WAY. TO ACTUALLY TARGET. THAT POPULATION BY DISTRICT ABOVE A CERTAIN LEVEL THAT'S LOWER- ARE AND THINK ABOUT IT DIFFERENTLY SO. I JUST THINK- OF THAT YOU GAVE US AN OPENING FOR SAYING IT'S BEING PHASED IN OVER FIVE YEARS AND I JUST THINK THAT NEED TO BE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT REALLY WORKS OTHERS NOT SUCH AN- ARBITRARY CUTOFF. FOR SOMEBODY THAT HAS A MAJORITY OF STUDENTS THAT ARE IN THAT CATEGORY. LET ME ASK- DO ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. BY SENATOR MEN. YEAH I JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON ON GERMAN THERE'S COMMON- YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE GOT A LOT OF SCHOOL DISTRICT I WROTE A HIGH CLASS AREA. AND YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE IS A SENATOR LOWER DESCRIBED THE PROBLEM OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT MIGHT HAVE FORTY FIVE OR FIFTY FOUR PERCENT- LOW INCOME ENGLISH LEARNER AND FOSTER USE. AND AS YOU POINT OUT YOUR YOUR PROPOSAL. LIKE CREATES WINNERS AND LOSERS WHICH IS IF YOU'RE A 55% YOU GET THIS AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM YOU GET A LOT OF MONEY FOR THAT- AND THAT BENEFITS ALL THE STUDENTS NOT JUST THE ONES THAT ARE LOW INCOME ENGLISH LEARNERS AND FOSTER USE. OURS IF YOU'RE THAT 54% YOU GET NOTHING AND THAT APPLIES FOR BOTH LOW INCOME STUDENTS BUT ALSO FOR. THOSE THAT MIGHT BE WORKING CLASS AND IN PARTICULAR THE HIGH COST- LIKE MINE WE MAY NOT ALWAYS QUALIFY BUT THEIR P. THERE'S A REAL NEED FOR AFTER SCHOOL ENRICHMENT. FROM A LOT OF HOUSEHOLDS THAT CAN AFFORD IT. AND I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE PROPOSAL CREATES REAL WINNERS AND LOSERS- IT'S NOT WELL TAILORED AT. THIS POINT IS SENATE EARLIER DESCRIBED. I A- YOU KNOW WHAT WE SUPPORT EQUITY I THINK THAT EQUITY HAS TO BE TARGETED ON WAYS TO ACTUALLY TO- THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED HELP WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT OUR OUR- SCHOOLS ARE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. ACROSS THE BOARD ARE ARE. YOU NOT HAVING THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO MEET THEIR BASELINE REQUIREMENTS. AND WE KNOW THERE A LOT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT EVEN WITH A 1% INCREASE ARE ARE GONNA BE STRUGGLING. ON BOTH THIS FALL AND GOING FORWARD. AND SO I GUESS I JUST ECHO TERMINAL. COMMENTS HERE IN AND JUST ASK YOU KNOW WHEN WE TAKE A STEP BACK. THIS IS A ZERO SUM GAME AND WE HAVE FINITE RESOURCES AND WE DON'T HAVE THIS I THINK YOU MENTIONED ONE OF THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. UNLIMITED RESOURCES TO FUND EVERYTHING. SO THE QUESTION IS WHY MAKE THE CHOICES WERE MAKING AND I DO JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW MORE FUNDING FOR THE LCF FORMULA. ALL FOUR BASS LINE IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE EMPHASIZED A BIT MORE AS WELL- BECAUSE I WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL SCHOOLS FOR. THOSE THAT HAVE 50% OR EVEN LESS THAN THAT. ALSO GET THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO. DEVELOP A GOOD IN SCHOOL. AND AFTER SCHOOL TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE NEEDED. HANK THANK YOU A CENTRAL JOB OF. THE QUESTION I AGREE WITH THAT SENTIMENT INCIDENT ALERTS QUESTION I DO HAVE A QUESTION HOW DO YOU FOLKS HOW DID THE FIFTY FIVE INCH MARC COME INTO PLAY- HOW DID HOW WAS THAT DETERMINED. END OF WHO IS THAT IS THAT DEPARTMENT OF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PROBLEMS CAN. EVERYBODY'S TAKEN A STEP BACKWARD AND NOBODY HAS TAKEN A STEP FORWARD. THE NONE OF US DOWN BUT THIS CENTER THERE- AREA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO I WAS NOT AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DURING THE INITIAL CONVERSATIONS AROUND WHEN THE FOR EXCUSE ME FOR- CONCENTRATION GRANTS WAS ESTABLISHED- BUT I IMAGINE IT WAS A LENGTHY POLICY DISCUSSION AT THE TIME AS TO WHY THAT CUT OFF WAS. DECIDED I WOULD REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT ALL DISTRICTS DO RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING ON TOP OF THE BASE GRANT AMOUNT WHICH IS EQUAL 220% OF THE BASE GRANT MULTIPLIED BY ALL OF THEIR ADA- IN IN EVERY ALLEY A AND THAT'S REGARDLESS OF- THAT 55% THRESHOLD OR NOT- AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO OUR- MORE RECENT PROPOSAL AT THE MAY REVISION AND IT BEING TIED TO THAT 55% THRESHOLD CONCENTRATION GROUNDS- THAT'S REALLY LIKE I SAID. IN MY PREVIOUS TESTIMONY MEANT TO PROVIDE SOME SYNERGY BETWEEN THIS NEW PROPOSAL AND SOMETHING EXISTING THAT HOUSE LIKE I SAID THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE AWARENESS LIKE THE LCS FAST SO THAT WAS REALLY THINKING UP UNFORTUNATELY AS TO THE- HISTORICAL QUESTION- I PERSONALLY CANNOT SPEAK VERY WITH MUCH EXPERTISE TO THAT BUT- PERHAPS PERHAPS SOMEONE ELSE CAN READ FROM THE ILIO- BUT YEAH THAT'S- THAT'S THE ANSWER FROM HERE. I THINK WE'LL TAKE THAT ARE DO YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS CENTER NO QUESTIONS AS THE COMMON JUST THAT I AGREE I WOULD LOVE TO SEE AN INCREASE IN THE BASE FINDING- FOR ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS I THINK THAT WOULD BE OF GREAT BENEFIT TO ALL. OF OUR ELEAZAR. THANK YOU. PLAN ON JUST NOTE THAT. WOMEN ARE COMMON AND NOT THAT'S TO BE A SORT OF TAKING ACCOUNT BY OUR IN COMMERCE- ARE AS WE MOVE ON THE BUDGET.

THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD MORNING SURE LAYERED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. YES WE ALTHOUGH CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE CHRONIC SHORTAGES IN THE TEACHING WORKFORCE THE SITUATION WILL BE EXACERBATED BY EXPECTED RECORD RETIREMENTS THIS YEAR. RECRUITING DEVELOPING AND RETAINING THE NUMBER OF CREEK TEARING THROUGH GRADE TWELVE TEACHERS AND OTHER EDUCATORS WING REQUIRES A MULTI FACETED MULTI YEAR EFFORT IN THE MAIN REVISED PROVIDES HISTORIC AND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. HE TO OUR EFFORTS WILL BE ENSURING THAT OUR EDUCATOR PREPARATION INSTITUTIONS OF THE CAPACITY TO ENROLL AND PREPARED THIS WORKFORCE ME REVISED PROPOSALS FOR BROWN'S IN HIGHER EDUCATION WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT TOWARD THAT END. WE NEED TO AT LEAST DOUBLE THE NUMBER SB K. THROUGH TWELVE OUR TEACHERS COMING INTO THE PROFESSION OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS TO ADDRESS THESE JORDANS. THE PROPOSED FUNDING STRATEGIES AND THEY RE PRICE WILL ALLOW US TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARD THIS GOAL AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK. YOU VERY MUCH AND- I THINK YOU'RE YOUR OTHER IS HERE FOR QUESTIONS ANOTHER CORRECT LET'S GO LET'S GO TO ELLIE GARDNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU CHAIR. WE GARNER FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND AS I NOTICED IT NOTED IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL MANY OF THE PROPOSALS IN THE NEIGHBORING VISION ALIGNED WITH THE SHACKLES OF THE SS PI SUPPORTING IN DIVERSIFYING OUR TEACHER WORKFORCE IS A CRITICAL INVESTMENT IS NEEDED NOW MORE THAN EVER. ANY OF THE TEACHER RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN OUR ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE CTC. WITH THE CVS ACCORDING OF THE INVESTMENTS IN OUR TEACHERS AND OUR EDUCATED WORK FORCE. WE RECOGNIZE THAT TEACHERS ARE BIGGEST ASSET IN CLOSING THE OPPORTUNITY GAP AND WE NEED TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST. SPECIFICALLY MALE TEACHERS OF COLOR AND TEACHERS IN THE FIELDS OF SCIENCE MATH AND SPECIAL EDUCATION. EARLY RESEARCH SAYS SHOWS THAT TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED THE PROPORTION OF TEACHERS. TEACHER CANDIDATES OF COLOR WHEN COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS. TEACHERS PREPARED RESIDENCY PROGRAM STATE OR OUR ROUTINES AT THEIR SCHOOLS AND TEACHING PROFESSIONS AT HIGHER RATE PARTICULARLY IN SCHOOLS AND HISTORICALLY HIGH TEACHER TURNOVER RATE. I WOULD ALSO NOTE QUICKLY THOUGH. THAT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS OUTLINED DO NOT INCLUDE. ARE CALLED PRE EXISTING PROGRAMS AND DON'T INCLUDE RESOURCES TO ADMINISTER THESE PROGRAMS AT CD I WOULD NOTE THAT- BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS PRE EXISTING ADDITIONAL DOLLARS AND- ADDITION A THIRTY ARE REQUIRED TO DO SOME OF THIS WORK AND WE DON'T SEE THAT. ADDED IN THE MAY REVISE AND LIKES AFTER THE LEGISLATURE I'LL CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS THERE AND CERTAINLY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN WILL MOVE TO EMILY FROM THE TELESALES OFFICE. GOOD MORNING SENATORS ANY LEAVE ALEJO SERVICE MORNING WE HAVE THREE OVER ARCHING POINTS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER ON THE TEACHER WORKFORCE AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS AND I WILL BE KEEPING HIS BRIEF. FIRST WE THINK THAT CAPACITY FOR NEW OR EXPANDED PROGRAMS WILL LIKELY BE LIMITED IMMEDIATELY POST PANDEMIC MAY REVISION PROVIDES ROSES NUMEROUS NEW AND EXPANDED EDUCATOR WORKFORCE INITIATIVES WHICH REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT GIVEN THE LIKELIHOOD OF BURNOUT AND FATIGUE AMONG MANY SCHOOL STAFF SCHOOLS MAY BE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE INITIATIVES IMMEDIATELY. RESPONSE THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER FOCUSING ON A FEW IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES TO HELP STUDENTS AND STAFF RECOVER FROM THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC AND EITHER REJECTING PROPOSALS OR EXTENDING SPENDING DEADLINES FOR OTHER PROGRAMS. SECOND WE NOTE THAT THE- TRAINING PROPOSAL'S OVERLAP WITH THE USES FOR FEDERAL FUNDING SCHOOLS HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBLE FUNDS FROM RECENT FEDERAL RELIEF PACKAGES WHICH CAN BE USED FOR VARIOUS ACTIVITIES INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT- THE LEGISLATURE ME JUST WANNA CONSIDER HOW. THE EDUCATOR TRAINING PROPOSALS COULD BEST COMPLEMENT AVAILABLE FEDERAL FUNDING. LASTLY WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER REQUIRING CLEAR DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTATIONS FOR THE EDUCATOR TRAINING PROPOSALS SEVERAL NAY REVISION PROPOSALS INCLUDE FEW DETAILS ON THE DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTED ACTIVITIES TO FIND IT. SOME PROPOSALS DO NOT SPECIFY THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES TO BE SUPPORTED WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING AS IS THE CASE WENT BACK EARLY MATH INITIATIVE AND TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SCHOOL LEADERSHIP ACADEMY. OR LACK ROUTINE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE LEGISLATURE AS IS THE CASE WITH THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANTS INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY'S FOR LEADERSHIP ACADEMY. WE THINK OPPOSE IT ESTABLISHING A CLEAR SET OF DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTATIONS FOR EACH PROPOSAL WOULD HELP ENSURE SPEND OUR- FUNDS ARE SPENT AS INTENDED AND ACHIEVE THE DESIRED OUTCOMES. WITH THAT HAPPY TO COMPLETE MY TESTIMONY AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE PERFECT. TIME FOR SELF. THANK YOU VERY. I HAVE A OF. BILL A MAJOR. SAID TO WAS GONNA COME UP SOME POINT ANYWAY. ADD ON TO THE L. A. O.'S COMMENT THAT WAS JUST MADE BECAUSE- THERE'S A CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THIS BUDGET THROUGHOUT WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED IN THIS HEARING. THEIR NUMBER OF NEW PROGRAMS OR EXPANDED PROGRAMS AND THE QUESTION IS. HOW ARE WE GOING TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO HAVE A VALUATION TO KNOW THAT THE MONEY IS LAID OUT. IS ACTUALLY BEING EXPANDED AS INTENT AND SO I THINK THAT. THAT AS WE MOVE TO CLOSE THE BUDGET WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF. THE IN THE OUR OUR BUDGET HEARINGS ARE DE FACTO OVERSIGHT HEARINGS AND WE CAN'T HAVE OVERSIGHT UNLESS WE KNOW FOR A FACT. THAT WHAT IS SUGGESTED IS ACTUALLY BEING DONE AND SO- I JUST MAKE THAT IS A GLOBAL COMMENT. LET ME ASK A QUESTION OF THE- OF DOCTOR MERRY SANDY. FROM THE CREDENTIALING COMMISSION. WHEN YOU TEST. AT OUR HEARING IN. FEBRUARY I BELIEVE IT WAS. THERE WAS NO DATA YET ON RETIREMENTS- OF TEACHERS DURING THE PANDEMIC ALL THE STATISTICS THE LATEST STATISTICS WERE PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AND I DID NOTE THAT IN YOUR COMMENTS TODAY YOU SAID EXPECTED RETIREMENTS IMPLYING TO ME THAT THAT THAT DATA STILL DOESN'T EXIST WHILE THERE WAS SOME DATA. ON THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS THAT HAD APPLIED FOR RETIREMENTS- HE IS THERE ANY CLEAR UNDERSTANDING YET ABOUT LOSS OF TEACHERS DURING THE PANDEMIC AND COMPARED TO THE NORMAL RATE OF ATTRITION. SO I DON'T HAVE ADDITIONAL REPORTS FROM CAL STIRS UP ON THIS AND HAVE NOT HEARD ANY KIND OF EXTENSIVE UPDATE ON THIS I KNOW THAT- I BELIEVE AT THE TIME OF OUR PRIOR HEARING WE WERE EXPECTING WE'D HEARD IN EXPECTATION OF ABOUT SIXTEEN. PERCENT OF RETIREMENT RATE THIS YEAR BUT I DON'T HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STEEP PERCENT OF TOTAL TEACHERS. OF THE WORKING TEACHING FORCE THAT'S MONUMENTAL S. AND WHAT IS THE ANNUAL RETIREMENT AVERAGE FOR THE PRECEDING YEARS PREVIOUS TO THIS YEAR AND THIS I DO NOT KNOW OKAY SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO COMPARED TO BUT IT IT JUST ON ITS FACE SEEMS LIKE THAT'S INCREDIBLY LARGE AND I THINK THAT IT'S JUST A STATEMENT THAT. WE WANT TO KNOW THIS EVEN IF WE'RE NOT SCHEDULING A HEARING WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE INDIVIDUALLY AND THE STAFF WHEN THIS DATA IS NO SERVER WE ARE CLEAR AND CAN FACTORED INTO OUR WORK. AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD WOULD BE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND I WAS GOING TO ASK BEFORE THE TESTIMONY DO THE L. E. H. HAVE THE CAPACITY TO STAND UP AND EXECUTE ALL THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE PROPOSED IN THE SECTION AND THEN- THE- A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SAID THEY ARE. OF FUNDED IN A WAY TO DEAL WITH THEIR ROLE IN SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS SO LET ME ASK FINANCE- HOW DO YOU ASSESS WHETHER THE L. A. AS HAVE THE CAPACITY TO STAND UP AND EXECUTE THESE PROGRAMS AND DO YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSE TO THE- THE CD THE THESE COMMENTS ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO. PARTICIPATE I'M YES KIMBERLY LEAHY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. BUT BASED ON DATA FROM THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING WE BELIEVE THAT- THEIR EXISTING PROGRAMS AND CERTAINLY- ABSORB ADDITIONAL CAPACITY FACTOR THERE IS THERE HAS BEEN AN UNMET NEED FOR TEACHER RESIDENCIES. RESIDENCIES THE CREATURE CREDENTIALING- PROGRAM THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN WELL RECEIVED BY ELLIE AS AND THEY CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE MORE FUNDING FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. AND WE'VE ALSO HEARD- WHITE A NEED FOR- ADDITIONAL COMPUTER SCIENCE INSTRUCTION IN OUR CLASSROOMS AND SO SEVERAL OF OUR INVESTMENTS- TEND TO ADDRESS THE NEED TO. PREPARE MORE TEACHERS TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE- COMPUTER SCIENCE INSTRUCTION- WE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO- ASSIST THEIR TEACHERS AND- AND OBTAINING THE AUTHORIZATIONS AND THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT NEEDS TO PROVIDE THAT INSTRUCTION- AND THEN AS FAR AS- THE- DEPARTMENT- NEEDING MORE RESOURCES TO. MANAGE OVERSIGHT OF SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED WITHIN THE ON THE LEDGE OF THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THESE PROGRAMS. OF REQUIREMENTS FOR- SOME MONITORING AND REPORTING AT CERTAIN POINTS THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMS ARE AT THE END OF THE PROGRAM'S. AND WE'VE ALSO- HAVE A COUPLE HAVE CALLED A COUPLE OF EXTENSIVE EVALUATIONS ON CERTAIN PROGRAMS. AND WE CAN PROVIDE YOU MORE YOUR STAFF IN YOUR OFFICE WITH DETAIL ON THAT IF YOU WOULD LIKE- BUT WE'VE TRIED TO. KEEP THE- RISK OF THOSE READ WE- AS MINIMAL. FOR THE DEPART S. HA. SO THIS THEY COULD EASILY ABSORB WITHIN RESOURCE AND YOU NEED AND THAT AND SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY ARE TO DO THEIR BEST TO MAXIMIZE AND OPTIMIZE- THEY'RE REPORTING- ABILITY WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES. I'M GOING TO IN A SECOND OUR CALL ON C. D. E. WHO HAS THEIR HAND UP. BUT LET ME JUST SAY YOU SPOKE TO THE NEEDS OF THE PROGRAM AND I DO NOT QUESTION THE NEED OF I WAS ASKING ABOUT THE ABILITY TO. TO STAND THESE UP AND DOTHEM AND SO- I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT FOR ME BUT NOW THAT WILL STILL WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT I THINK THAT'S- MAYBE I MISUNDERSTOOD BUT IT SEEMS DIFFERENT THAN THE NEED FOR THE PROGRAM OF THE BUILDING TO STAND IT UP SOMEONE YOU RECOGNIZE OF. THE. WE GARNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU CHAIR GARNER BEHALF OF STATES IN. PUBLICANS TWENTY THURMOND. WE WOULD NOTE THAT IT'S NOT JUST RECORDING AND MONITORING THIS IS REQUIRED OF CDP FOR MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS WHETHER PRE EXISTING OR OR NOT IT'S RUNNING THIS PROGRAMS AND SO WHAT WE WOULD NOW IS THAT THERE'S A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR. ON INVESTMENT FOR NEW NATIONALLY BOARD CERTIFIED TEACHERS THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AND THERE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE ANY PROVISION FOR RESOURCES FOR CDT IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM. IS ALSO- OR THE NEW COMPUTER SCIENCE OR READING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE DID DID. THAT ARE PART OF THE KNEE REVISION WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS MINIMAL REPORTING AND MONITORING BUT STANDING UP THESE PROGRAMS WITHIN OUR CURRENT STRUCTURE. IS NOT SUFFICIENT AND SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED SOME SUPPORT. ON THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT IN STATE OFFICE AS WELL AS A POSITION OF AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE. TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PROMISED. MAY I MAY I CORRECT THE RECORD. ON IN TERMS OF PROJECTED RETIREMENTS FORUM SURE. SO ONCE RAFTER JUDY WOODRUFF TIES TO DO THAT BEFORE THE END OF THE NEWS BROADCAST AS WELL. OKAY WELL I'M IN GOOD COMPANY THEN- IT'S NOT SIXTEEN PERCENT- THE PROJECTED NUMBERS- THAT WE'VE SEEN ROM CAL STIRS ARE AT AROUND SIXTEEN THOUSAND. AND IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR- THE RETIREMENT WAS AT AROUND TWELVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NINETY SIX THE PRIOR YEAR IT WAS THIRTEEN THOUSAND PLUS. ALL THE LAST TIME WE SAW AS MANY AS SIXTEEN THOUSAND TEACHERS RETIRE WAS IN TWO THOUSAND NINE TEN THAT'S THE- TIME TO THE GREAT RECESSION. YEAH GREAT RECESSION CARRILLO SEN THANK YOU SAID TO THEM YOU KNOW WE WILL PUT AWAY OUR BLOOD PRESSURE PILLS. SO WITH WE APPRECIATE YOUR CORRECTION- ME GO- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SENATORS ANYTHING. WE DO NOT HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND I DIDN'T GO DEEPER INTO THIS BECAUSE I THOUGHT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES WOULD BUT LET ME NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE JEFF LET ME JUST SAY THAT- THE- THAT I WENT INTO IT AND I THINK WE WILL WANT TO LOOK INTO THE FINER POINTS OF SOME OF THE SAYS. AS WE NEGOTIATE THURMAN AND GO THROUGH THE BUDGET STANDOFF I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S- PRESENTATION. OF NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO TO A MAJOR ISSUE- ISSUE SIX THE EARLY EDUCATION. AND WE HAVE JESSICA HOLMES- WITH. EMMA ALSO HAVE- EARNED LISTED AGAIN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SARAH CORTEZ AND ALSO HAVE CAN COUPON LISTED FROM THE AUDIO AND SERRA NEVER MORGAN FROM THE- A CDP SO LET'S TAKE THEM IN THAT ORDER AND- WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE WILL START WITH JESSICA HOLMES. MORNING MR CHERRY MEMBERS JESSICA HOMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE MAYOR THIS INCLUDES A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD IMPLEMENT UNIVERSAL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. TO EXPAND TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN BEYOND THE THREE MONTHS AS A FOUR YEAR OLD WHO CAN CURRENTLY ACCESS THE PROGRAM. ON TO A FULL TWELVE MONTHS OF FOUR YEAR OLDS TO ALLOW ALL STUDENTS TO ACCESS THE PROGRAM. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM WHICH BEGAN IN THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- SCHOOL YEAR AND WILL BE IMPLEMENTED OVER A SERIES OF THREE YEARS- IN WITH FULL IMPLEMENTATION IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE- ANTICIPATED AND TO BE GENERATED BY THE EXPANSION OF THIS PROGRAM. IS APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED MILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE GROWING TO TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION ON GOING. ON THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO REVENGE THE GUARANTEED. TO BRING TO THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE TO BRING NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. INTO THESE THE STATE SCHOOLS FUNDING WHICH IS PROP NINETY EIGHT I'M JUST TRYING TO BREAK IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT FOR FOLKS WHO MAY NOT UNDERSTAND. WHAT WHAT THAT MEANS BUT BRINGING BRINGING NON IDENTIFIED SCHOOL DOLLARS INTO THE SCHOOL FUNDING SYSTEM- IN ADDITION TO THIS PROPOSAL WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING TO. DECREASE THE CURRENT RATIOS THE ADULT TO STUDENT RATIOS IN TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOMS AT SPECIFICALLY. BY FUNDING AN ADDITIONAL ON EITHER CLASSIFIED OR CERTIFICATED STAFF PERSON FOR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOMS. I'M AT A COST OF THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE GROWING TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. AND THIS ADDITIONAL STAFF PERSON WILL ALLOW RATIOS TO LOOK A LITTLE MORE SIMILAR IN TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AS THEY WOULD OTHERWISE LOOK IN OTHER. ON FOUR YEAR OLD PRESCHOOL OR PREKINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS- IN ADDITION WE SEE THIS A PROPOSAL AS PAIRING WITH THE EXTENT OF LEARNING PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE A- FULL DAY OF CARE- FOR WORKING FAMILIES- IN THOSE OF THOSE CONCENTRATION GRANT DISTRICTS WHERE THE EXPANDED LEARNING PROPOSAL WOULD BE. UNFUNDED I WILL I WILL LEAVE MY PRESENTATION THERE JUST TO KEEP IT SHORT AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND ARE I ASSUME MR RADIUS HERE TO- FOR QUESTIONS ARE. NO THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE SERVER CORTEZ FROM THE DALLAS OFFICE. MORNING SIR CORTEZ LA- I'M ACTUALLY AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS AND MY COLLEAGUE CAN COMBINE IS GOING TO BE MAKING THE COMMENTS FOR OUR OFFICE- FOR. THEM MISTER COUPON WELCOME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. I THINK YOU MISSED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SO I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GIVE YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW OF WHAT THIS PROPOSAL AS- YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER IS BACK IN JANUARY THE ADMINISTRATION HAS. ALSO HAD A PROPOSAL RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN- THERE WAS SOME ONE TIME INCENTIVE FUNDING FOR EXPANDING THE PROGRAM. BUT IT WASN'T THERE TO US WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO ACHIEVE OVER THE LONG RUN- SO I THINK THIS MAY REVISION IMPROVES UPON THAT BY PROVIDING A SPECIFIC- GO ALL AN IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE. AND SOME TRANSITION FUNDING. THAT'S ALIGNED WITH THE PROPOSAL- JUST IN TERMS OF THE FIRST- THIS SIDE OF THIS PROPOSAL. SO THIS THIS DECISION TO BE THE GUARANTEE ESSENTIALLY THAT IS A PROPOSAL TO RE CALIBRATE THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FORMULAS OVER TIME IS THAT THEY GENERATE MORE FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE I WITH THE IDEA THAT THAT THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL COVER- THE EVENTUAL TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. AND IN THINKING ABOUT THE DECISION FOR A BENCHING THAT REALLY JUST COMES DOWN TO YOUR- OVERALL BUDGET PRIORITIES. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE INCREASE A GUARANTEE LIKE THAT IS ALLOWABLE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE DON'T THINK IT'S CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED. WHAT IT REALLY MEANS IS THAT OVER TIME THE STATE WOULD BE ABLE TO SPEND MORE ON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PROGRAMS. AND LESS ON NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PROGRAMS. THAT DIFFERS FROM AND THE- PROPOSED STAFFING REDUCTION PROPOSAL- THAT WOULD BE PAID FOR WITH WITH AN EXISTING GROWTH IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE. ARE THERE ARE STILL SOME IMPORTANT DETAILS TO BE WORKED OUT I THINK THE MOST THEM I. WHAT'S THE POINT ONE IS THE FUTURE OF THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM THAT CURRENTLY SERVES A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF FOUR YEAR OLDS AND SO IT WILL BE IMPORTANT WE THINK FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ENGAGE IN THAT PROGRAM AND- IN SHAPING THE FUTURE OF WHAT THE SCOPE OF THAT PROGRAM IS AND WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE MOVING FORWARD- BUT ALL IN ALL THIS IS I THINK- MUCH MORE FLESHED OUT. I THINK A PROPOSAL THE MONEY'S ON JANUARY. AND WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN WILL MOVE TO A CERTAIN LEVEL MORGAN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THEIR NOVEL MORGAN DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TO RETIREMENT THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO SEE HAS STARK INVESTMENTS IN EARLY EDUCATION PROPOSED TO ME REVISED. DECADES OF RESEARCH DEMONSTRATE THAT HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING EXPERIENCE. CAN HAVE LONG LASTING IMPACTS ON BOTH SHORT TERM OUTCOMES AND LONG TERM OUTCOMES. THESE HIGH QUALITY LEARNING EXPERIENCES IN THE PRESCHOOL YEARS ARE POSSIBLE INVEST SCHOOL BASED AND COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS THAT NED TO BE ADEQUATELY RESOURCE FOR HIGH QUALITY PROGRAM STANDARDS. RECENT RESEARCH OUT OF BOSTON PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOUND THAT THEIR SCHOOL BASED PRESCHOOL PROGRAM THE STATE COLLEGE ATTENDANCE SAT TEST TAKING AND HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES WHILE ALSO DECREASING. JUVENILE INCARCERATION. WE HOPE THAT THE PER A STARK INVESTMENTS IN TRANSITIONAL. KINDERGARTEN FORTY K. WELL LET CALIFORNIA SERVICE EACH OF THE OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOUR YEAR OLD CHILDREN IN THE STATE. WAS FAMILIES WISH TO ACCESS A HIGH QUALITY IN FREE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM AND ALLOW CALIFORNIA DISTURBS MANY MORE AT THE NEARLY THREE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND. THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLD CHILDREN CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE BUT NOT SERVED BY SUBSIDIZED EARLY LEARNING CARE PROGRAM. THERE CRITICAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED TO MAKE UNIVERSAL T. K. WORK FOR CHILDREN FAMILIES COMMUNITIES AND SCHOOLS EXACTLY. HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL LEARNING EXPERIENCES REQUIRE INTENTIONAL INVESTMENTS AND WELL QUALIFIED EDUCATORS APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENTS RESPONSIVE INTERACTIONS CURRICULUM INFORMED BY ONGOING ASSESSMENTS. MEANINGFUL FAMILY ENGAGEMENT. WORK FOR MULTI LINGUAL LEARNERS AND FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES THE DECREASE TEACHER CHILD RATIO IN THE ME REVISED PROPOSAL HELPS WITH THAT BUT MORE ATTENTION TO THE PROGRAM STANDARDS FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS IS NEEDED. THE EXPANSION OF T. K. AS WELL AS STABILIZATION OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM OR C. S. B. P. CREATES AN URGENT NEED FOR AN ESTIMATED THOUSANDS OF NEW TEACHERS AND EIGHT. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ADEQUATE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED AND INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS ARE PUT INTO PLACE TO SUPPORT THE EXISTING PRESCHOOL WORKFORCE. THE BILL THESE JOBS SINCE THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE ART IN OUR DIVERSE BETTER REPRESENTING THE CHILDREN THAT IS TYPICAL FOR K. TWELVE. AND ALSO DESERVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE IN THEIR FIELD. YES COULD BE DONE YOUR MANY OF THE PROGRAMS. AND REFERRED TO IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL BUT ALSO CAN BE USED THROUGH EXPANDING THE CLASSIFIED TEACHER WORKFORCE PROGRAM. INCLUDE A PATHWAY FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD PROFESSIONALS FOR A TEACHING CREDENTIALING PROGRAM. THE TICKET EXPERIENCE MUST BE DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE AND INCLUDES RICH LEARNING EXPERIENCES THREE PLAY INVESTMENT IN A PRESCHOOL LEARNING FOUNDATIONS IN CURRICULUM WILL HELP WITH THAT AS WELL AS SOME COACHING INVESTMENTS ON THAT SPECIAL ED FINE. BUT JUST DEPORTING INCLUSIVE PRACTICE. BUT WE COULD EVEN EXPAND THINGS LIKE THIS CALIFORNIA THE M. THE FTP CURIS BLOCK GRANT SO THAT THERE ARE SYSTEMS THAT ARE ALREADY EXISTING. ECONOMIC SUPPORT NOT JUST THE QUALITY OF STATE PRESCHOOL BUT PROVIDE COACHING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORTS. TO TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOMS. HE CAME WEST ALSO FAMILIES NEED AND CHOICE. THE GOVERNOR'S MAY PROPOSED AROUND UNITS AFTER SCHOOL FOR T. AND MY SCHOOL. WILL GO A LONG WAY SUPPORT THE NEED FOR FAMILIES HAVE A FULL DAY OF CARE. WE APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION THAT THERE WAS EXPANDED LEARNING AFTER SCHOOL OPPORTUNITIES NEED TO HAVE LOWER ADULT CHILD RATIOS IN THE CURRENT. DO YOU. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE NEXT A PARENTAL CHOICE IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM FOR WHAT IT IS CURRENTLY MANY PARENTS ARE FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PROGRAMS THAT MIGHT PROVIDE BETTER LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND PROGRAMS THAT ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY ACCESSIBLE HOURS THAT MEET THEIR NEEDS FOR. PRESSING THE COST PRESSURES WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT YOU CAN REDUCE YOUR OVERALL EXPANSION OF ACCESS TO RICH LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES INSTEAD OF LOSS OF CAPACITY. AND THIS WILL REQUIRE PLANNING AND INVESTMENT IN THE EXISTING PRESCHOOL SYSTEM AND INFRASTRUCTURE. MOVING ONTO THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM DESPITE THE MAY REVISED MAJOR INVESTMENT IN TEEKAY WE KNOW THAT THE C. S. P. P. PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BIG PART OF CALIFORNIA'S PRESCHOOL SYSTEM. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AS THEY DEVELOP THEIR COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR THE FUTURE OF C. S. B. P. IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE MASTER PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS. AND ALSO ENSURETHAT HEAD START AS PART OF THAT DISCUSSION. A PART OF STABILIZING THE FUTURE AND AVAILABILITY OF THIS YEAR'S PPP PROGRAM WILL BE ADDRESSING COMPENSATION AND COSTS OF PROVIDING QUALITY CARE. THERE WERE A FEW ITEMS MISSING FROM THE NAY REVISED PROPOSAL THAT I WILL TOUCH BASE WITH. A SUPER COLLAPSE. WELL WE APPRECIATE RECEIVING A CALL OF OUR PROGRAMS WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS DID NOT RECEIVE A COLOGNE LAST YEAR. IN LIGHT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AROUND CAGE FILE AS WELL AS HOW MUCH OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE STRUGGLING NOW WE WOULD ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO ALSO ALLOCATE SCENE COLLECTED THE. S. B. P. ADVOCATE TWELVE. IT IS THE P. P. RIGHT. ONE PIECE THAT WE WILL NEED TO ADDRESS AS A- THE CURRENCY S. B. P. FROM GOING OUT OF BUSINESS AND SUPPORT THE GOALS OF THE MASTER PLAN. IS TO ADDRESS THE CSP CARE RATE WHICH IS FAR BEHIND THE T. K. RATE. AS WELL AS BEHIND THE AVERAGE REGIONAL MARKET RATE. FOR NON AND FOR THE VOUCHER BASED SIDE OF OUR CHILD CARE SYSTEM. EVEN WITH THE PROPOSED COLA IN MAY REVISED YES PP STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR S. R. R. IS NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND LESS PER CHILD. THAN THE AVERAGE ARM OUR REGIONAL MARKET RATE FOR THE SAME EACH CHILD IN A CARE SETTING. CENTER BASED. AND IT'S ALSO LESSEN THE AVERAGE FAMILY CHILD CARE RATE NEITHER OF WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO MEET THE SAME LEVEL OF QUALITY. PROGRAM STANDARDS ASKED THE SBP. CORRECT THE PROCESS. WE KNOW PROPOSAL WAS HEARD IN THE SPEND THREE HEARING YESTERDAY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. AND WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WHILE THE ME REVISED PROVIDES TO CDSS WITH SIX MILLION TO SUPPORT DIRECT DEPOSIT PER CHILD CARE PROGRAMS UNDER THEIR PURVIEW STARTING JULY ONE. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE SUPPORT FOR C. D. E. AND FOR CSGP THESE WERE NEED TO BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE CVS S. B. P. SO THAT IT DOESN'T CREATE INEQUITIES TO OUR CONTRACTORS. ALTERNATIVELY THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALLOCATE THE RESOURCES CURRENTLY PLANNED FOR THIS TO THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE SAID THAT A STATEWIDE SOLUTION THAT WOULD APPLY TO BOTH DEPARTMENTS COULD BE DEVELOPED WHILE CONTINUING TO MAINTAIN TRANSPARENCY ESTATE ACCOUNTING DATA. THROUGH THE FISCAL SYSTEM INSTEAD OF NEEDING OUTSIDE OF THAT. DATA THE CD WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT DATA IT NEEDS AROUND THE S. P. P. AND RIDE OF CONNECTIONS TO CRADLE TO CAREER AND THE MASTER PLAN GIRLS AROUND PRESCHOOL TO THIRD GRADE ALIGNMENT. FINALLY WE WANT TO FLAG THAT THEY MAY REVISED PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT NEW WORKLOAD AROUND UTK THE PRESCHOOL LEARNING FOUNDATIONS AS WELL AS THE EARLY MATH INITIATIVE. WITHOUT ADEQUATE COURSE MONEY NEW STATE OPERATION PRIME IN CONCLUSION WE HAVE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS ON THESE PROPOSALS TO HELP STRENGTHEN THEM. AND ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS YOU WORK TOWARDS FINALIZING YOUR BUDGET PACKAGE. THIS CONCLUDES. OUR COMMENTS THANK YOU. THANK VERY MUCH- AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO COME QUEST IN A FEW A NEED TO SO OF SAY ABOUT THE AT THE BEGINNING BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH AN AMBITIOUS PROPOSAL. THAT WE HAVE STATE PRESCHOOL WE HAVE HAD START WE HAVE OTHER CHILD CARE ARE WE HAVE A TRANSITION IN THE WHOLE QUESTION OF HOW EVERYTHING FITS TOGETHER IT IS THIS IS JUST A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION HERE AND IT AND WHETHER WE ASK IT OR NOT. EVERY INDIVIDUAL PIECE OF THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE AT THE HEART OF WHATEVER THE DISCUSSIONS ARE BECAUSE WELL WE SHARE GENERAL DIRECTIONS- THOSE ARE ISSUES IN FOR EXAMPLE LET ME ASK FINANCE FIRST. AND THIS JUST ILLUSTRATES A TRYING TO FIT IT TOGETHER. THE IF THE PARENTS WILL HAVE THE OPTION TO KEEP THEIR FOUR YEAR OLDS IN STATE PRESCHOOL HEAD START OR OTHER CHILD CARE. EVEN IF THEY ARE AGE ELIGIBLE FOR T. K. AND WHETHER THAT'S EITHER DURING THE TRANSITION AFTER HOW DOES THAT FIT TOGETHER. AND THERE ARE THIS IS JUST GO HOMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. SO THE IDEA HERE WHERE WE'RE NOT PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE FOUR YEAR OLD ELIGIBILITY IN THE OTHER- EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS AND WE'RE NOT PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE FOR ELIGIBILITY- FOR ANY OF THAT THE SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE PROGRAMS. ON HEAD START OR- STATE PRESCHOOL AND TO RETAIN PARENT CHOICE. I CAN'T SPEAK TO- YOU KNOW SEVERAL YEARS DOWN THE ROAD- I CAN'T SPEAK TO WEAR ON THE STATE MAY DECIDE TO GO WITH THOSE PROGRAMS BUT FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE- WE ARE PLANNING ON- AT RETAINING THAT ELIGIBILITY I WILL SAY THAT FOR THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR. WE ARE- WE ARE AT IT AND PROPOSING THAT IN THE TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE BUDGET- OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT WE WILL DEVELOP A PLAN. TO HELP PROVIDERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY PROVIDING SERVICES- THROUGH THE C. S. P. PROGRAM TO SERVE MORE YOUNGER CHILDREN WITH THE RECOGNITION THAT. WILL LIKELY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT RATES UNDERSTANDING THAT THE RATIOS FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN ARE MUCH DIFFERENT. THAN THEY ARE FOR YOUR CHILDREN SO THAT IS- PART OF AN ONGOING CONVERSATION AND- CERTAINLY YOU KNOW ALL OF ALL OF OUR PROPOSALS ARE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE MASTER PLAN FOR EARLY LEARNING CARE SO IN TERMS OF. HOW THESE PIECES FIT TOGETHER ON THAT THERE CERTAINLY IS THAT A LOGIC IN A PLAN BEHIND IT- BUT FOR NOW THAT. WE ARE WE ARE WE ARE COMMITTED TO PARENT CHOICE AND RETAINING THE ELIGIBILITY. THOSE PROGRAMS FROM. THAT OF BILL. THAT IS WITH. IT IT LET ME. ASK ONE UP JUST ON THAT SPECIFIC POINT BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU CAN'T. BOB WHATEVER THE WORD WAS USED YOU CAN'T FORESEE INTO THE FUTURE AND NO WAY INTO THE FUTURE WHAT WILL HAPPEN BUT- BOB WHAT WE CAN IS IF THERE'S A TRANSITION. AND WE GET. OUR- YOU KNOW THE EARLY EDUCATION PROPOSAL UP. DOES THAT PRESUME THAT YOU'RE ALLOWING- PARENTAL CHOICE AFTER THE TRANSITION BECAUSE THAT IS PART OR SHOULD BE PART OF THE PLAN NOW A DESCRIPTION OF WHERE WHAT THAT IS SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE PROGRAM GOES COMPLETELY UP WITH PARENTAL CHOICE ON THE OTHER PROGRAMS WOULD THAT CONTINUE. AFTER THE TRANSITION TO A FULLY BEING UP. SO OUR OUR CURRENT PROPOSAL ROUTINES RETAINS THE PARENTAL CHOICE- REGARDLESS OF WHERE WE'RE AT THE TIKI TRANSITION I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT- CURRENTLY SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN AT FIVE. UNDER FIVE YEARS OLD AND OLDER CAN ACCESS- ALL OF OUR SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE PROGRAMS AND SO WE WOULD SEE FOUR YEAR OLDS- FOLLOWING THAT THAT SAME LOGIC. IN OUR ENERGY AS SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE PROGRAMS- I THINK YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF NOT BEING ABLE TO PREDICT THE FUTURE CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAY MAKE CHANGES IN HEAD START- THAT I CAN'T PREDICT- AND- IT MAY BE THAT- YOU KNOW THERE'S A PROPOSAL TO. INTEGRATE STATE PRESCHOOL WITH SOME OTHER CHILD CARE PROGRAMS- IN THE FUTURE THAT THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS- I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME BILLS OUT THERE- THAT THAT LOOK AT SORT OF THE ZERO TO THREE POPULATION. I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHERE THOSE ARE GOING TO GO SO THAT'S WHAT I MEANT BY NOT BEING ABLE TO PREDICT THE FUTURE BUT THIS PROPOSAL ASSUMES. THAT FOUR YEAR OLD ELIGIBILITY FOR AT THE EXISTING CHILD CARE PROGRAMS WILL REMAIN INTACT- DURING THE TRANSITION AND AFTERWARDS AND I GET THAT WE CAN'T PREDICT WHAT OTHER ENTITIES ARE DOING OR EVEN THE STATE LEGISLATURE ON CERTAIN PIECES OF THIS GOING FORWARD BUT WE KNOW WHAT WE KNOW NOW. AND WITH YOUR PLAN BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW NOW. IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE ABSENT ANY OTHER CHANGES IT IS YOUR PLAN TO CONTINUE PARENTAL CHOICE AND THESE OTHER PROGRAMS. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CASE THAT A CORRECT STATEMENT THAT IS A CORRECT STATEMENT YES OKAY. ARE THANK YOU AND IT BUT IT ACCENTUATES HOW THERE'S SO MANY DETAILS ABOUT THIS THAT THAT JUST PROPOSING IT IS NOT ENOUGH IT IS ROSY. SORT OF FLUSHING OUT THESE DETAILS SO THERE'S CLARITY FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED AND I KNOW THAT IT'S PHASED IN BY AGE GROUP- OVER NUMBER OF YEARS AND FINALLY THERE WERE BE AND IT. TO BORN BUT OCT TO. AND- IT IN THE SYSTEM BUT ARM. HE I THINK THAT THAT WERE REALLY GOING TO WANT TO DRIVE SOME OF THESE TO GROUND IT IF WE'RE GOING TO. APPROVE THIS AND I MEAN JUST ONE RANDOM QUESTION IS. FOR EXAMPLE. ON T. K. AS EACH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL REQUIRED TO OFFER T. K. UNDER THIS PLAN OR IS IT ONLY ONE SITE PER DISTRICT. SO THAT THE WE'RE NOT PROPOSING ANY CHANGES TO THE CURRENT CONSTRUCT OF TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN CURRENT REQUIREMENTS REQUIREMENTS UNDER TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN SO THE CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT EVERY ALLEY A IS I'M REQUIRED TO GIVE ACCESS. TO ALL. FOUR YEAR OLDS TO T. K. YOU KNOW CURRENTLY I THINK IT LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT PARTICIPATE IN TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN MANY ELEAZAR DO NOT PROVIDE ACCESS TO T. K. EVERY SITE HOWEVER GIVEN- THAT WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING ACCESS TO THAT PROGRAM- MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT- ALL. ALL LEDS WILL HAVE TO UTILIZE THE SPACE THAT AT ALL THEIR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS ON TO SERVE THE STUDENTS SO- WE'RE NOT PROPOSING ANY CHANGES- TO THE CURRENT LAW- HOWEVER GIVEN THE INCREASE IN MAGNITUDE OF STUDENTS BEING SERVED IT'S LIKELY THAT WHAT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE CURRENTLY WILL NOT BE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. ON A FEW YEARS AND THEN THAT RAISES THE QUESTION THAT IF BEFORE TRANSITIONING OVER A FEW YEARS AND WE HAVE LOW STUDENTS TO ADULT RATIOS. OF INDIE NT K. TEACHERS HAVE EARLY CHILDHOOD. EDUCATION EXPERIENCE. HOW DO WE- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE- WITH THOSE REQUIREMENTS TO HAVE THE PEOPLE AND- THE EDUCATION DONE IN TIME TO STAND THIS UP THE WAY IT IS PROJECTED IN THIS TIME. FOR THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND YOU KNOW EAT. IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT ALL OF OUR PROPOSALS REGARDING A TEACHER AT PREPARATION IN TEACHER RECRUITMENT- THAT IS CERTAINLY TIED TO THIS AND DOES INCLUDE- TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AS- YOU KNOW A CREDENTIAL THAT WORK WE'RE TRYING TO RECRUIT WE'RE TRYING TO- I BRING PEOPLE ON BOARD AND- YOU KNOW WE'RE CERTAINLY WE UNDERSTAND THAT FOR SOME- ELEAZAR. THE TWENTY FOUR UNITS AT EASE YOU MAY BE A BARRIER WERE HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT. WHAT WHAT MAKES SENSE IN TERMS OF. OF YOU KNOW ROLLING THAT REQUIREMENT OUT AND THAT IT WOULD JUST WOULD NOTE THAT THE ADDITIONAL STAFF PERSON THAT NEEDS TO BE IN THE CLASSROOM CAN BE CLASSIFIED STAFF. PERSON OR CERTIFICATES APPERSON THIS. ON THEIR- A BROADER POOL AND THE BILL WORKFORCE I'M FOR THAT POSITION. KARAMANA ARE I THINK IT'S AN EXAM. THAT IT'S TO BE A CHIU- ME WHY ARE I COULD GO ON WITH SOME OF THESE QUESTION BUT I I'VE TO WHERE I'VE- TO GO WHICH IS. HELLO BIT OF. SIGNALING TO THAT THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT THE THIS RELATES TO THE OTHER. THAT THERE'S GOOD THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF DETAIL THAT SOME OF THE IMPEDIMENTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD DO THIS AND HAVE SOME CHECK AND TO KNOW HOW WE ARE DOING. OUR AT THOSE DIFFERENT TIMES AND- IT IT JUST IS A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION ABOUT THE INTEGRATION- BECAUSE THAT THAT MAYBE ONE. OR LAST FOLLOW UP TO MISS HOLMES. IF WE OFFERED THE PARENTAL CHOICE AND CONTINUE ALL THESE ARE DIFFERENT OPTIONS. DO YOU HAVE ANY PRESUMPTION AS PART OF YOUR PROPOSAL ABOUT HOW MANY WOULD BE ANTI K. AS OPPOSED TO THE OTHER PROGRAMS I MEAN WHAT THE PERCENTAGE OF THE SECTORS ARE. IN WHO WOULD BE WHERE. CERTAINLY SO I CAN SHARE- OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I CAN SHARE OUR- ESTIMATES FOR AND HOW MANY FOUR YEAR OLDS WOULD MOVE OVER TO TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. OF WHAT I CAN'T PROVIDE WITH ANY LEVEL OF ACCURACY OR PRECISION IS ON HOW MANY MIGHT BE RETAINED I'M IN THE OTHR PROGRAMS- BECAUSE WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF HOW MANY STUDENTS- WILL WANT TO STAY- IN THE CHILD CARE PROGRAMS THAT SUBSIDIZE CHILD CARE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE- OUTSIDE OF T. K. BUT WE ARE. WE ARE ATICIPATING THAT- APPROXIMATELY APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FOUR YEAR OLDS- WHAT WILL BE COMING INTO THE T. K. SYSTEM UPON FULL IMPLEMENTATION- THAT MAY TAKE A FEW YEARS TO- TO. MATERIALIZE IF YOU LOOK AT THE ROLL OUT OF T. K. WHEN IT WAS FIRST- COMING INTO BEING- ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO- WE SLOWLY KIND OF INCREASED- THAT. THAT AT. THE FOUR YEAR OLD WHO ARE PARTICIPATING I'M AS MORE PARENTS BECAME AWARE OF ITS EXISTENCE AND OUR CHILD ELIGIBILITY- SO THAT TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF TIME BUT ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION WERE DISTRIBUTING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND. ADDITIONAL STUDENTS AND PART OF TE REASON WHY I CAN'T GET A GREAT AT NUMBER ON THE OTHER PROGRAMS YOU KNOW HOW MUCH HOW MANY KIDS WE ARE. ANTICIPATING WILL STAY IN THOSE PROGRAMS IS BECAUSE TKA HAS OPEN ELIGIBILITY FOR ANY STUDENT AND THOSE PROGRAMS ARE MEANS TESTED SO THEY DO HAPPEN INCOME ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. SO IT'S HARD TO MEASURE THE IMPACT THE DIFFERENCE AN IMPACT ON FAMILIES WHO QUALIFY FOR THE CHILD CARE PROGRAMS VERSUS. I'M LOOKING AT YOU KNOW THE TOTAL AN INFLUX OF KIDS FROM ALL INCOME LEVELS. OKAY I JUST THINK THAT SIGNALS- A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS WERE GOING TO HAVE TO HAPPEN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SENATOR MAN. FOR QUESTIONS FOR DEPARTMENT FINANCE- FROM ITS FIRST CLASSROOM SPACE- THIS THIS YOUR BUDGET CONTEMPLATES JUST THE NEED TO ACQUIRE OR BUILD OUT MORE PHYSICALS INFRASTRUCTURE. CERTAINLY YES THE DESK HOMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE PER WE INCLUDED TWO HUNDRED MILLION- FOR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN FACILITIES- IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REDUCE THAT BY ABOUT TEN MILLION TO COVER THE COST OF PRESCHOOL LEARNING FOUNDATION UPDATES YEAH- BUT WE HAVE A HUNDRED NINETY MILLION FOR- TKA FACILITIES AND THEN THE REVISION. THANK YOU FOR THAT I APPRECIATE THAT- AND THEN I GUESS I THINK I HAVE A QUESTION FOR- WAS IT IS NOBLE MORGAN I THINK YOU'VE REFERENCED- SOME OF THE STUDIES AROUND T. K. AND I'M SURE THOSE ARE ARE RIGHT WE KNOW EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS SUPER IMPORTANT- CENTER LEARN KIND OF. ALLUDED TO THE THERE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A TRADE OFF HERE BETWEEN. HIGHER QUALITY EDUCATION VISITED SHOPPED HERE RIGHT AND I GUESS. THE QUESTION IN A MOVIE ST THE RADICAL BUT- YOU KNOW IF WE WERE TO PRIORITIZE UNIVERSAL T. K. R. FOR UNIVERSAL CHILD CARE. WHICH OF THOSE WILL HAVE LIKE BETTER PEDAGOGICAL AL COMES DOWN THE LINE IS TO SAY. OR IS IT MORE IMPORTANT TO JUST HAVE PEOPLE WATCHING YOU IN SORT OF- REGULATED SAY SPACES WHAT WHAT WHAT IS IT WHAT IS A RESEARCHER ON THIS AS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO PROCEED. SO WHEN I DON'T WANT TO DO IS GET INTERIOR FOR THE WARS THAT HAPPENED BETWEEN ACCESSING QUALITY. BUT WHAT I CAN DO IS SPEAK TO SOME OF THE RESEARCH FAMILIES NEED BOTH THEY NEED THEIR CHILDREN. TO WATCH WHILE THEY'RE AT WORK BUT THOSE WORK THOSE SETTINGS. NEED TO BE HIGH QUALITY AND REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY ARE HOME BASED SCHOOL BASED. AND PRICE TAG. IN THE COMMUNITY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TEACHERS HAVE THE QUALIFICATIONS. REPORT THE RESOURCES. WE CAN ENGAGE IN RESPONSIVE INTERACTIONS. ESPECIALLY AS CHILDREN GROW OLDER THAT THEY REALLY USE CURRICULUM THAT IS INFORMED BY THE CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENT. AND THAT IT'S AN ONGOING ASSESSMENT PIECE. SO WORKING IN THIS FIELD YOU REALLY DO NEED RESOURCES SUPPORTS EDUCATION. AND RESEARCH CLEARLY SHOWS HOW MUCH THAT IS HE SAYS MATTER ESPECIALLY MOST OF ITS TARGET PRESCHOOL RESEARCH WITH THE BOSTON PUBLIC SCHOOL WHEN JUST COMING OUT. THIS WEEK ORLAST WEEK WITH VERY STRONG OUTCOMES THEY HAVE BEEN VERY INTENTIONAL PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. THAT ACTUALLY STARTS WITH G. I THINK IT'S A FOR YOU ALSO MIGHT BE THE THRILLS BUT ALSO GOES THROUGH KINDERGARTEN FIRST GRADE. SO THAT THEY HAVE ALIGNMENT IN CURRICULUM AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. THERE'S ALSO SOME RESEARCH TO SHOW THAT TEACHER COMPENSATION. AND HOW YOU SUPPORT THE EDUCATORS CAN PASS BOTH IN RETENTION AS WELL AS- BEING ABLE TO GET THE TEACHERS WITH THOSE LEVELS OF EDUCATION THAT YOU MIGHT NEED. I APPRECIATE THAT I GUESS I JUST. WOULD FALL ON CENTER LAYERS COMMONSENSE. OBVIOUSLY WE ALL WANT. TEEKAY THANK AN IMPORT PRIOR AND I PUT THIS AFTER FROM THE PART FINING. AT THIS TIME. YOU KNOW IT A LOT OF FAMILIES THERE WHERE THREE HOURS A CHILD CARE OR THREE HOURS A T. K. REALLY DOESN'T HELP THEIR TRUCKERS SITUATION AND- THAT THAT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO BE. THINKING ABOUT AS WELL AND- SO I APPRECIATE THAT I LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THIS TOPIC AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU CAN JUST SAY ONE MORE THING THAT I REALLY DO THINK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THAT WENT OUT ON THAT EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES TIME. SO THAT FAMILIES WHO WORKS USING T. K. WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT IMMEDIATE PICK UP BUT THAT THE SCHOOL SITE EXCEL. COULD ADD ON WHAT WE CALL THE ASUS PROGRAM. BUT HAVE IT BE DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE WITH THAT SMALLER RATIO FOR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AND KINDERGARTEN CHILDREN. SO THERE'S A LOT THAT I FEEL LIKE THE MASTER PLAN CALLED OUT IN THAT IS BEING PROPOSED IN THIS. THAT HELPS THINK AROUND ABOUT THAT THAT FAMILIES AREN'T HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT. I'M AT WORK AND I HAVE A JOB WHERE I CAN'T LEAVE TO GO PICK UP AND MOVE MY CHILD BUT ACTUALLY CAN USE T. K. AS EIGHT EIGHT PART OF MY CHOICE SETTING TYPE. AND THEN HAVE THAT CHILD WRAPPED AROUND WITH OTHER. CARE SO THAT I CAN STAY AT WORK. THANK YOU. APPRECIATE BURKE THE COMMENTS ON THAT ITEM. AND I THINK IF WE REALLY DRILL DOWN FURTHER WE COULD GO ON FOR A FEW HOURS ON THIS BUT I THINK THE MAJOR CONCERNS WERE RAISED TO THE BE THE DISCUSSION AS WE- WE MOVED TO DO. THIS BUDGET ITEM SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO THE LAST ISSUE WHICH IS OTHER K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION PROPOSALS AND TO BE QUITE HONEST. WITH ANYTHING THAT DIDN'T FIT ANYWHERE ELSE THAT SORT OF OUR OUR CLOSES US OFF HERE SO- THAT IS THE COMMON THEME.

THAT ALSO NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS DIFFERENT- THEN THE PROPOSAL DISCUSSED DURING HEARING EARLIER THIS MONTH- SO NOW I'D LIKE TO HEADED OFF TO MY COLLEAGUE AMY LEAD TO SHARE THE REMAINDER OF THE COMMENTS ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU ANYWAY WHAT THE L. A. L. ON SPECIAL EDUCATION WE ONLY HAVE ONE COMMENT RELATED TO THIS SPECIAL EDUCATION INCLUSIVE. SETTINGS WORK GROUPS.

THANK YOU CHARLIE GARNER ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND. AGAIN MANY OF THE PROPOSALS AND THE MAJOR REVISION ALIGN WITH CIRCLES OF THE SS PI. THE FBI S. S. P. A. IS INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL TO SEE THAT THE ME REALIZE INCLUDE SUPPORT FOR THE STATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS WHICH COULD NOT OTHERWISE BENEFIT FROM MANY OF THE KOBE CARE ACT. ON EMERGENCY INVESTMENTS IN EDUCATION THAT THE MAINTENANCE IS ESPECIALLY APPRECIATED. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF TOPICS THAT MAKE UP THIS ITEM I DO WANT TO TAKE A FEW MOMENTS TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS A FEW PROPOSALS IN PARTICULAR- REGARDING THE UNIVERSAL MEALS THE ONGOING STATE COMMITMENT OF A HUNDRED AND L. HUNT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR UNIVERSAL MEALS. AND A HUNDRED MILLION IN ONE TIME INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRAINING FUNDING STARTS IS ON THE RIGHT PATHWAY TO LONGER TERM INVESTMENTS IN OUR CHILDREN'S OVERALL WELLBEING AND ACADEMIC SUCCESS. BY BREAKING DOWN FOOD ACCESS BARRIERS. FOR THE MORE SUCCESS IN THIS AREA IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF ADDRESSING THE OPPORTUNITY GAP AS STUDIES CONFIRM THAT THERE IS INCREASED PARTICIPATION IN THE SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAMS FROM ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF ECONOMIC STATUS. ALL CHILDREN EAT FOR FREE. THERE ARE HOWEVER THE- TO THE TWENTY FIVE CENT PER KRIPO. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT PROPOSAL. WONDER STUDENTS ARE BETTER ABLE TO REACH THEIR FULL ACADEMIC POTENTIAL HAVE GREATER HEALTH OUTCOMES THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE. THE OTHER ITEM THAT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. WE WANT TO AGAIN COMMENDED THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS INVESTMENT IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. BUT WE JUST-NEED THAT THE 50% MATCH REQUIREMENT NEED BE AN ISSUE FOR A NUMBER OF LEDS IN APPLYING FOR THE FUNDS. WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT CITIES TIMELINE FOR IMPLEMENTATION WILL BE REALLY DEPENDENT ON THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT JUMP FROM THE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED. WE LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. AND THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT THE OPERATIONS AND CONDITIONS. TO ENSURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS CAN BE FULLY SUPPORT IT. SO WITH THAT I'LL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARM. WELL LET ME. MAKE A COMMENT AND THEN ASK A SPECIFIC QUESTION IN THE COMMENT IS I NOTE THE L. A. O.'S COMMENTS ABOUT STILL LACKING DETAILS ABOUT MANY THINGS AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE GONNA WANNA. HAVE THEM AND IT MAY GOVERN WHERE WE WANT TO GO. R. ONE SOME OF THOSE DETAILS BECOME CLEARER AND JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. AND FOR FINANCE OF THERE IS THE PROPOSAL. ARE YOU HERE. FOR ADDITIONAL PROP NINETY EIGHT OF FOUR OF THE L. A. AGE TO PARTICIPATE IN ONE OF THE FEDERAL UNIVERSAL PROVISIONS AND I WONDERED. HOW MANY SCHOOLS DOES THE ADMINISTRATION ASSUME WOULD EXPAND TO THIS PATTERN. BOB A SCHOOL SIDE GIVEN THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS I MEAN WHAT'S THE SCALE OF WHAT COULD BE DONE BY THIS RECOMMENDATION REQUEST. THANK YOU ALLEN CHAU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I THINK- WE WOULDN'T KNOW FIRST THAT THERE IS ALREADY FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT- PARTICIPATION IN THESE UNIVERSAL MAIL PROGRAMS- E DID FACTOR AND- GROSS I THINK. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ACCOUNT FOR OVER FOUR THOUSAND SCHOOLS- BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE- AND SURVEYING- OVER- TWO TWO MILLION CLOSER TO AN HAVE- MILLIONS TOTAL COVERED BY THESE PROVISIONS N. N. WHEN YOU SAID FOUR THOUSAND IS A THAT FOUR THOUSAND NEW SCHOOLS. I KNOW THAT BAG IS. TOTAL DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE CURRENT NUMBER IS IT'S FROM WHAT TO FOUR THOUSAND. I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC NUMBER- RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME- BUT I DID I THINK JUST AS A BALLPARK WOULD BE- AN INCREASE OF- SEVERAL HUNDRED SCHOOLS- AND PROBABLY I THANK- BREASTS. MAYBE ABOUT FIFTEEN COULD FOLLOW UP WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THE PRECISE NUMBERS BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD HELP US UNDERSTAND THE SCALE RELATED TO THE MONEY. I'M ASSUMING THE SILENCES YES YOU'LL PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO THE- OKAY GREAT THANK YOU YEAH ARE THEN I'LL ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS ON ANY ADDITIONAL ITEMS AN ISSUE. SEVEN THEN I DON'T SEE ANY SO. LET ME JUST- THANK THE PANELISTS AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AS DETAILS BECOME CLEARER WE WILL- WE WON'T ARE. FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO AND LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE DETAILS AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT IN A MOMENT. AND THE END SO OUR MAJOR- PUBLIC COMMENT WILL INFLUENCE US BUT BASED ON WHAT WE'VE HEARD THUS FAR LET ME JUST MAKE A FEW SUMMARY COMMENTS WHICH IS. WITH THIS AMOUNT OF GROWTH IN THE MONEY WOULD LOVE TO SEE PAYING OFFTHE DEFERRALS. I THINK THAT. THE BECAUSE WITH ALL THE L. E. A. SUPPORTING STE STUDENTS RETURNING AND THEN HAVING A LOT OF NEW PROGRAMS WITH NEW REQUIREMENTS WERE GOING TO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CAPACITY AND THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WILL BE INTERESTED IN THE- A. N. OF WHETHER OR NOT SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL OFFSETS OR THINGS THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE FOR FURTHER CONTRIBUTIONS. AND THEN LOOK AT THE SYSTEM THAT'S PROPOSED FOR TKA AND WHETHER IT'S A TRULY. MAKES DELIVERY SYSTEMATICALLY SAID ARE AND WHETHER WE NEED TO BUILD UP THE OTHER ONES IF WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE THEM THERE AS WELL AS DOING TO. THE TKA OF FOR PARENTAL OPTION SO I HOPE THAT. THAT WE WILL HAVE DISCUSSIONS THOSE ISSUES THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE HEADLINES IT CAME OUT AN ADDITIONAL. WE ARE CALL TENSION BACK TO THE COMMENT ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY. THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ALL THESE NEW PROGRAMS- WE REALLY NEED TO KNOW HOW THEY WILL BE MEASURED AND WHAT THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WILL BE. AND HOW WE AS AN OVERSIGHT BODY IS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS WILL BE ABLE TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS. OF ALL OF THESE AS THE START DECEPTIVELY VERY IMPORTANT TO US WE DID ASK FOR SOME UPDATED INFORMATION. IN THE PREVIOUS ITEM AND WHEN WE KNOW ABOUT A TEACHER RETIREMENTS AND SOME OTHERS AS IT WENT ALONG AND I WOULD JUST CALL THAT OUT AGAIN. BECAUSE OF THAT WE DO THAT WITH THAT ARE I THINK WE WILL MOVE TO. PUBLIC. COMMENT AND THE N. WE- ARE SUPPOSED TO BE OUT OF THE ROOM AND NOT TO DISTANT FUTURE SO I WILL. I WILL ASSESS THE LENGTH OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT THE MODERATOR TELLS ME LINE FOR MY NOT BUT FIRST BEFORE GOING TO THE MODERATOR. I WILL ASK IF THERE'S ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM THAT WISHES TO COMMENT ON THE ITEMS THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY. SINAN I WILL GO TO A ROOM ON TWELVE.

AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT BASED ON WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY. FONG WE WOULD BE LUCKY IF THAT'S JUST HALF BY THE TIME WE'RE DONE AND- AND SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS- LET EVERYBODY KNOW THAT- WE'RE GONNA HAVE A THIRTY SECOND LIMIT. AND SUGGEST IS THE BEST YOU CAN. DO YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION AND THE GENERAL GIST AND WILL ALLOW AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE. TO REVISE AND EXTEND THEIR- REMARKS IN WRITING TO THE COMMITTEE SO THAT BECAUSE WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU BUT WE ALSO. THERE'S ANOTHER COMMITTEE.
