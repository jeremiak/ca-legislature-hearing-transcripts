HAD A LONG TERM.

00:14:59.298 --> 00:15:01.333
INTEREST AND ROLE IN HR AND THE

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:01.934
WINE INDUSTRY TO BRING THAT

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:03.502
EXPERTISE COUPLED WITH OUR

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:07.606
ACADEMIC FACULTY IT'S JUST MAGIC

00:15:07.673 --> 00:15:07.906
[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:09.642
SO.

00:15:09.708 --> 00:15:11.810
I MENTIONED THE VISION AND WE

00:15:11.877 --> 00:15:13.679
HAVE A BIG STAKE IN RESEARCH AND

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:14.346
THE FACULTY HAS BEEN WORKING ON

00:15:14.413 --> 00:15:16.181
THAT AS WELL AS THE CURRICULUM

00:15:16.248 --> 00:15:18.050
THAT'S VERY FOCUSED ON INDUSTRY

00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:19.852
ISSUES.

00:15:19.918 --> 00:15:21.920
WHEN WE PRESENTED AT THE

00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:23.889
FINANCIAL SYMPOSIUM LAST FALL?

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:25.858
THESE WERE THE ISSUES AND

00:15:25.924 --> 00:15:26.425
CONCERNS THAT THE INDUSTRY

00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:28.193
IDENTIFIED AS MOST SALIENT AND

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.995
MOST CRITICAL RIGHT NOW.

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:31.797
IN THE ONE ON WORKFORCE

00:15:31.864 --> 00:15:33.866
CONTINUES IT'S CHALLENGING AND

00:15:33.932 --> 00:15:36.068
IT'S NOT THE COST OF LABOR IT'S

00:15:36.135 --> 00:15:37.870
JUST SIMPLY THE AVAILABILITY OF

00:15:37.936 --> 00:15:39.972
PEOPLE TO FILL THE ROLES THAT WE

00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:41.840
HAVE IN THE KNEES.

00:15:41.907 --> 00:15:43.809
OTHER THINGS AS WELL AND NATURAL

00:15:43.876 --> 00:15:46.345
DISASTERS HAS BECOME QUITE A

00:15:46.412 --> 00:15:46.912
CONCERN AND WE WANT TO TALK

00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:50.249
ABOUT A MORE ABOUT THAT TODAY.

00:15:50.316 --> 00:15:50.816
SO WE'RE GOING TO A LITTLE

00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:52.284
DEEPER DIVE INTO RESEARCH AND

00:15:52.351 --> 00:15:54.453
THAT'S TALK ABOUT AN ASSESSMENT

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.255
OF THE NORTH COAST WILDFIRES

00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:58.257
THAT WE DID BACK IN.

00:15:58.324 --> 00:15:58.857
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IF YOU

00:15:58.924 --> 00:16:00.559
WATCH THE COVERAGE IT WAS

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:02.594
DEVASTATING -- MANY PEOPLE LOST

00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:06.198
HOMES LIVES BUILDINGS PROPERTY

00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:08.300
AND BUSINESSES WERE IMPACTED.

00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:12.338
BUT THE THE MISSTEP ON CNN AND

00:16:12.404 --> 00:16:14.373
OTHER PROVIDERS OF THE CONTENT.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.308
THEY GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:18.410
THE WINE INDUSTRY WAS CLOSE.

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:22.314
AND THE BOARD GAVE US A CHARGE

00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:22.948
YES IN THE BOARD GAVE US THE

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:24.817
CHARGE THEY SAID LOOK WE NEED TO

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:26.352
DOCUMENT THE TRUTH.

00:16:26.418 --> 00:16:26.985
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT VINEYARDS

00:16:27.052 --> 00:16:28.620
WEREN'T BURNED REALLY A SMALL

00:16:28.687 --> 00:16:30.422
NUMBER IN A SMALL NUMBER OF

00:16:30.489 --> 00:16:32.291
WINERIES DISPLAY SO WE WENT OUT

00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:34.226
AND GOT THE NUMBERS WE FIND OUT

00:16:34.293 --> 00:16:34.827
THAT NINETY NINE POINT 8% OF

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:36.562
VINEYARD ACRES IN THE NORTH

00:16:36.628 --> 00:16:38.364
COAST WERE UNAFFECTED BY THE

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:38.597
FIRES.

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:40.499
SO WE BEGAN -- PROCESS OF

00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:42.501
GETTING THAT WORD OUT THROUGH

00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:44.370
THE MEDIA AND THROUGH OUR OTHER

00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:46.271
STAKEHOLDERS IN THE INDUSTRY TO

00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:46.872
HELP WRITE THE SHIP ON THAT

00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:50.209
STORY BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY A

00:16:50.275 --> 00:16:52.277
DEVASTATING ECONOMIC IMPACT. TO

00:16:52.344 --> 00:16:54.246
HAVE THE TOURIST NOT COM.

00:16:54.313 --> 00:16:56.648
ANOTHER AREA THAT WE'VE WORKED

00:16:56.715 --> 00:16:58.650
ON OR THE COMMUNITY PERCEPTIONS

00:16:58.717 --> 00:17:00.552
OF WINE BUSINESSES IN THE NORTH

00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:02.254
COAST.

00:17:02.321 --> 00:17:04.623
ALMOST TO A PERSON PEOPLE REALLY

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.792
LIKE WINE IN THIS AREA THEY LIVE

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.694
HERE THEY TAKE THEIR FRIENDS AND

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:10.596
FAMILY TO VISIT WINERIES THEY

00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:12.498
LOVE THE P. CALL LIKE ASPECT OF

00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:14.466
THE VINEYARDS -- IT'S PRETTY

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:16.668
BEAUTIFUL -- WE LIVE IN A GREAT

00:17:16.735 --> 00:17:18.604
REGION THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:18.937
NORTH COAST.

00:17:19.004 --> 00:17:20.773
THE MIKE CAME HE'S GONNA TALK A

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:22.341
LITTLE BIT LATER FROM THIS

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:22.975
NUMBER CONNIE VENDORS ABOUT THE

00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:24.510
CHALLENGES LOCALLY SOMETIMES

00:17:24.576 --> 00:17:26.478
WHEN YOU WANT TO START A NEW

00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:28.347
WINE BUSINESS.

00:17:28.414 --> 00:17:28.914
YOU WANT TO PUT IN THE NEW

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:30.315
VINEYARD OR PERHAPS MODIFYING

00:17:30.382 --> 00:17:32.484
EXISTING PERMIT IT CAME IF YOU

00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:34.319
WERE AT SOME OF THE HEARINGS YOU

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:36.255
THINK THAT ONE WAS BIG OIL.

00:17:36.321 --> 00:17:38.557
AND THERE'S A LOT OF HYPERBOLE

00:17:38.624 --> 00:17:42.361
THROWN AROUND.

00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:44.363
YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:44.563
THEN.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:52.371
SO THIS WASN'T.

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:54.807
SO AGAIN THE BOARD TASKED US

00:17:54.873 --> 00:17:56.642
WITH HE THAT'S GET THE FACTS ON

00:17:56.708 --> 00:17:58.377
THIS AND SO WE COMMISSIONED A

00:17:58.444 --> 00:17:59.011
STUDY WE DID THE RESEARCH AND

00:17:59.077 --> 00:18:02.514
HERE'S WHAT WE FOUND. 7474% OF

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:04.616
RESIDENTS IN THE NORTH COAST

00:18:04.683 --> 00:18:06.552
HAVE A VERY POSITIVE IMPRESSION

00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:08.587
OF THE WINE INDUSTRY 4% NEGATIVE.

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:10.756
AND WE DON'T SEE THOSE KIND OF

00:18:10.823 --> 00:18:12.658
NUMBERS ON ANYTHING SEVENTY FOUR

00:18:12.724 --> 00:18:14.660
VERSUS FOUR THEY HAD A LITTLE

00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:16.428
SLICE IN THE MIDDLE THAT'S JUST

00:18:16.495 --> 00:18:16.995
FINE EVERYTHING'S MEN'S THE

00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:17.229
MEN'S.

00:18:17.296 --> 00:18:18.831
SO THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO

00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:20.466
DOCUMENT.

00:18:20.532 --> 00:18:22.501
AND THAT HAS BEEN A HELP TO

00:18:22.568 --> 00:18:24.670
LOCAL PEOPLE -- AND LOCAL

00:18:24.736 --> 00:18:26.605
LEADERS LIKE MIKE IN CARRYING

00:18:26.672 --> 00:18:28.640
THE MESSAGE FORWARD AT PLANNING

00:18:28.707 --> 00:18:30.576
COMMISSION MEETINGS -- ANOTHER

00:18:30.642 --> 00:18:32.578
IMPORTANT THING TO DOCUMENT HAS

00:18:32.644 --> 00:18:34.580
BEEN THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE

00:18:34.646 --> 00:18:35.247
WINE INDUSTRY AND WHAT A CRUCIAL

00:18:35.314 --> 00:18:36.915
ROLE THEY CRY THEY PLAY IN JOB

00:18:36.982 --> 00:18:40.486
CREATION NOT ONLY IN WINERIES.

00:18:40.552 --> 00:18:42.554
AND VINEYARDS BUT ALSO THROUGH

00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:43.222
THE WHOLE VALUE CHAIN OF CHANGE

00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:44.890
THAT IS SUPPORTED BY THE SUCCESS

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:46.725
OF THIS INDUSTRY.

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:48.961
AND THE PUBLIC RECOGNIZES IT AND

00:18:49.027 --> 00:18:52.564
ALSO THE PUBLIC RECOGNIZES HOW

00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:54.466
PHILANTHROPIC WINE INDUSTRY IS.

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:56.435
IT'S A IT'S AN AMAZING VIRTUOUS

00:18:56.502 --> 00:19:00.439
CIRCLE YOU SEE OF GIVING WHERE.

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:01.106
99% OF THE WINERIES IN THE NORTH

00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:04.576
COAST SPECIFICALLY TARGET

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:06.545
THEY'RE GIVING TO THE LOCAL

00:19:06.612 --> 00:19:08.680
INTERESTS VERY VERY LOCALLY

00:19:08.747 --> 00:19:10.482
MINDED.

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:12.951
AND DR SAKAKI MENTIONED THE WINE

00:19:13.018 --> 00:19:14.620
INDUSTRY SCHOLARS PROGRAM.

00:19:14.686 --> 00:19:16.922
ALREADY OVER THREE MILLION

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:18.690
DOLLARS HAS BEEN COMMITTED TO

00:19:18.757 --> 00:19:20.592
THAT PROGRAM THAT PROGRAM

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:22.561
DIRECTLY SUPPORTS FIRST

00:19:22.628 --> 00:19:23.161
GENERATION STUDENTS AND THEY

00:19:23.228 --> 00:19:24.863
DON'T HAVE TO STUDY ONE THEY CAN

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.498
STUDY WHATEVER THEY WANT.

00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:28.667
BUT WE WANT PEOPLE WHO'VE WHOSE

00:19:28.734 --> 00:19:30.536
PARENTS HAVE WORKED IN WINE

00:19:30.602 --> 00:19:31.136
YOU'VE WORKED IN AGRICULTURE

00:19:31.203 --> 00:19:32.838
MORE BROADLY WE WANT THEIR

00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:34.540
CHILDREN TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:19:34.606 --> 00:19:36.608
TO GET AN EDUCATION WHATEVER

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:37.242
THEY CHOOSE TO STUDY HERE IT'S

00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:38.577
AND I'M A STATE.

00:19:38.644 --> 00:19:42.581
IT'S REALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE.

00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:44.950
AND THEN EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:47.052
WE HAD A REPORTED ARE NOVEMBER

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:48.787
BOARD MEETING FROM SOME OF THE

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:50.455
FACULTY AND IT WAS IT WAS

00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:52.691
STARTLING -- THEY WENT ON AND

00:19:52.758 --> 00:19:54.626
DOCUMENTED THE PREPAREDNESS OR

UNDER PREPAREDNESS OF MANY -- IN

00:19:56.929 --> 00:19:58.830
THE WINE BUSINESS AND THIS IS IN

00:19:58.897 --> 00:20:00.799
THE FALL BUT IT'S JUST -- WE'RE

NOT READY FOR EVERY EVERY

00:20:02.901 --> 00:20:04.703
TRAGEDY THAT CAN COME OUR WAY

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.572
AND THEY DOCUMENTED THE BEST

00:20:06.638 --> 00:20:07.205
PRACTICES AND SOME OF THE BEST

00:20:07.272 --> 00:20:08.941
CASES THAT THEY FOUND WITH

00:20:09.007 --> 00:20:10.676
WINERIES ARE DOING IT REALLY

00:20:10.742 --> 00:20:10.876
WELL.

00:20:10.943 --> 00:20:12.811
AND AT OUR SUMMIT ON JULY TENTH

AT THEIR ONE BUSINESSES IN

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:23.288
VINEYARDS.

00:20:23.355 --> 00:20:25.090
AND IT SPEAKS TO SOMETHING THAT

00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:27.025
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT OUR

00:20:27.092 --> 00:20:28.894

ASK OUR LEGISLATORS IF THEY

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:33.198
WOULD HELP SUPPORT SOME OF THIS

00:20:33.265 --> 00:20:34.933
RESEARCH THAT WE'RE DOING ONE

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.602
ONE BUSINESS.

00:20:36.668 --> 00:20:37.235
AND SO THAT IS MY ASK FOR YOU

IT'S THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS OR

00:20:44.876 --> 00:20:46.678
PERHAPS CONNECTION THE AGENCIES

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:47.312
AND DEPARTMENTS IN SACRAMENTO

00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:49.214
THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

00:20:49.281 --> 00:20:51.149
SOME OF THIS RESEARCH THAT WE'RE

00:20:51.216 --> 00:20:52.851
DOING SPECIFICALLY ON THE

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:54.786
BUSINESS OF WINE.

00:20:54.853 --> 00:20:55.387
THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING WE

00:20:55.454 --> 00:20:58.957
COULD DO [INAUDIBLE]

ON WHAT'S HAPPENING.

00:23:00.278 --> 00:23:02.280
IN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

00:23:02.347 --> 00:23:04.082
NO G. YOU C. DAVIS -- ORDERS

00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:04.683
VERY COMPLIMENTARY TO WORK WE

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.518
JUST TALKED ABOUT -- WE FOCUS

00:23:06.585 --> 00:23:08.587
MUCH MORE ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE

00:23:08.653 --> 00:23:12.257
OF THINGS -- IS THERE FOCUSING

00:23:12.324 --> 00:23:18.196
MORE ON THE BUSINESS -- JUST

00:23:18.263 --> 00:23:20.332
BRIEFLY UC DAVIS -- AS I THINK

00:23:20.398 --> 00:23:22.501
OF YOU KNOW IS -- IS PART OF THE

00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:24.436
UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM.

00:23:24.503 --> 00:23:28.406
IT'S THE LAND GRANT -- ONE OF

00:23:28.473 --> 00:23:29.074
THE MAIN LINGERING CAMPUSES IN

00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:30.142
CALIFORNIA.

00:23:30.208 --> 00:23:32.344
AND I THINK THE KEY THING IS

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.312
HERE TO KEEP THINGS ONE IS IT'S

00:23:34.379 --> 00:23:34.679
IT IS THE TOP.

00:23:34.746 --> 00:23:36.515
PROGRAM IN AGRICULTURE IN THE

00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:38.617
COUNTRY ONE OF THE TOP. TWO IN

00:23:38.683 --> 00:23:40.485
THE WORLD PROBABLY.

00:23:40.552 --> 00:23:42.554
AND THAT MEANS THAT WHILE I'M

00:23:42.621 --> 00:23:44.489
GOING TO FOCUS ON THE DEPARTMENT

00:23:44.556 --> 00:23:46.424
VITICULTURE ANALOGY -- THE

00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:48.293
NUMBER OF PEOPLE RESEARCHERS

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.595
STUDENTS FOCUSED ON AGRICULTURE

00:23:50.662 --> 00:23:52.397
IN GENERAL IS MUCH BROADER THAN

00:23:52.464 --> 00:23:54.299
IN OUR DEPARTMENT AND WE TAKE

00:23:54.366 --> 00:23:54.933
ADVANTAGE THAT ALONG THE WAY AS

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.336
WELL.

00:23:58.403 --> 00:24:00.672
THE THE HISTORY OF OUR

00:24:00.739 --> 00:24:02.741
DEPARTMENT STARTS ACTUALLY IN IN

00:24:02.808 --> 00:24:04.609
EIGHTEEN EIGHTY AND IT STARTS

00:24:04.676 --> 00:24:05.243
WITH THE ACT FROM YOU FROM THE

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:08.513
STATE LEGISLATURE -- BECAUSE AT

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.080
THAT POINT THE STATE ALREADY

00:24:09.147 --> 00:24:11.016
KNEW THE GRAPES ONE WE'RE GOING

00:24:11.082 --> 00:24:12.884
TO BE IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMY

00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:13.251
OF CALIFORNIA.

00:24:13.318 --> 00:24:15.086
AND SO THEY DECIDED THAT THERE

00:24:15.153 --> 00:24:18.590
NEEDED TO BE A PLACE TO TRAIN --

00:24:18.657 --> 00:24:19.224
TRAIN PEOPLE TO GROW GRAPES AND

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:20.625
MAKE.

00:24:20.692 --> 00:24:21.193
ONE COURSE AT THAT POINT THE

00:24:21.259 --> 00:24:22.761
ONLY CAMPUS SERVES UNIVERSE

00:24:22.828 --> 00:24:23.361
CALIFORNIA WAS A BERKELEY AND

00:24:23.428 --> 00:24:26.665
THE DEPARTMENT STARTED THERE IN --

00:24:26.731 --> 00:24:28.834
EIGHTEEN EIGHTY IT SUPPORTED THE

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.602
GROWTH OF THE THAT FIRST KIND OF

00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:32.671
GROWTH OF THE INDUSTRY AND THE

00:24:32.737 --> 00:24:34.639
THE LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS.

00:24:34.706 --> 00:24:36.908
AND THEN -- AFTER THE END OF

00:24:36.975 --> 00:24:38.844
PROHIBITION MOVED OUT TO DAVIS

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:42.614
WORDED IT'S BEEN SENSE -- AND IS

00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:44.683
IS REALLY CREDITED FIRST --

00:24:44.749 --> 00:24:46.985
HELPING THE INDUSTRY TO RECOVER

00:24:47.052 --> 00:24:52.624
FROM PROHIBITION AND TO REGAIN

00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:54.726
THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WAS LOST

00:24:54.793 --> 00:24:55.327
DURING THOSE THIRTEEN YEARS.

00:24:55.393 --> 00:24:56.895
THE DEPARTMENT HAS HAS COME UP

00:24:56.962 --> 00:24:58.663
WITH NEW KNOWLEDGE NEW

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.966
TECHNOLOGY -- AND I THINK MOST

00:25:01.032 --> 00:25:02.901
IMPORTANTLY TRAINED STUDENTS

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:05.003
THAT GO OUT INTO INDUSTRY -- FOR

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.773
MANY YEARS NOW -- THROUGH THE

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:09.374
END OF PROHIBITION AND THEN

00:25:09.441 --> 00:25:11.042
THROUGH THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES

00:25:11.109 --> 00:25:12.611
WERE THERE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES

00:25:12.677 --> 00:25:12.811
WERE.

00:25:12.878 --> 00:25:15.180
FEWER THAN A HUNDRED WINERIES TO

00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:16.915
PRESENT DAY WHERE THERE'S NO

00:25:16.982 --> 00:25:17.515
MORE THAN FORTY FIVE HUNDRED

00:25:17.582 --> 00:25:19.150
WINERIES IN THE STATE OF

00:25:19.217 --> 00:25:19.451
CALIFORNIA.

00:25:19.517 --> 00:25:21.319
AND OUR OUR DEPARTMENT HAS

00:25:21.386 --> 00:25:25.257
HELPED. TO TWO FOR FUEL AND

00:25:25.323 --> 00:25:26.958
SUPPORT THEIR GROWTH.

00:25:27.025 --> 00:25:28.927
WE DO THAT WITH THREE A CORE

00:25:28.994 --> 00:25:31.229
MISSIONS -- THAT'S TEACHING

00:25:31.296 --> 00:25:33.265
RESEARCH AND EXTENSION AND I

00:25:33.331 --> 00:25:35.433
LIKE TO SPEND A FEW MINUTES

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.034
TALKING ABOUT EACH OF THESE

00:25:36.101 --> 00:25:37.469
BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE ALL ALL

00:25:37.535 --> 00:25:39.337
THREE OF THESE ARE IMPORTANT.

00:25:39.404 --> 00:25:41.706
IN -- AND HELPING THE INDUSTRY

00:25:41.773 --> 00:25:43.575
TO BE STRONG AND TO GROW IN THE

00:25:43.642 --> 00:25:45.343
WAY IT WOULD LIKE.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:45.877
TO AND SPORT THE ECONOMIC

00:25:45.944 --> 00:25:47.746
BENEFITS THAT COME FROM INDUSTRY

00:25:47.812 --> 00:25:49.414
AS WELL.

00:25:49.481 --> 00:25:51.449
SO START WITH RESEARCH -- WE

00:25:51.516 --> 00:25:54.019
HAVE A SIXTEEN FACULTY MEMBERS

00:25:54.085 --> 00:25:56.154
IN THE DEPARTMENT -- THE COVER A

00:25:56.221 --> 00:25:58.123
WIDE RANGE OF DISCIPLINE

00:25:58.189 --> 00:25:59.691
ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES MY

00:25:59.758 --> 00:26:00.191
BACKGROUND IN CHEMICAL

00:26:00.258 --> 00:26:01.626
ENGINEERING AND WE HAVE A FEW

00:26:01.693 --> 00:26:03.628
CHEMICAL ENGINEERS BUT WE ALSO

00:26:03.695 --> 00:26:05.664
CHEMISTS AND MICROBIOLOGISTS.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:06.231
AND CENTURY SCIENTIST AND A

00:26:06.298 --> 00:26:09.634
WHOLE RANGE OF PLANT BIOLOGISTS

00:26:09.701 --> 00:26:11.636
FROM VERY BASIC TO REPLY

00:26:11.703 --> 00:26:11.937
[INAUDIBLE]

00:26:12.003 --> 00:26:12.437
HAVING THIS [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:12.504 --> 00:26:14.072
THIS.

00:26:14.139 --> 00:26:16.041
KIND OF GROUP OF ACADEMICS IN

00:26:16.107 --> 00:26:16.574
ONE DEPARTMENT IS ACTUALLY

00:26:16.641 --> 00:26:18.310
FAIRLY UNIQUE IN THE WORLD.

00:26:18.376 --> 00:26:20.111
AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY OUR

00:26:20.178 --> 00:26:20.412
DEPARTMENT.

00:26:20.478 --> 00:26:24.115
IS -- CONSISTENTLY THOUGHT OF AS

00:26:24.182 --> 00:26:26.351
THE TOP PROGRAM IN GRAPE GROWING

00:26:26.418 --> 00:26:28.219
WINEMAKING IN THE WORLD -- THESE

00:26:28.286 --> 00:26:30.422
ARE THE KIND OF DISCIPLINES THAT

00:26:30.488 --> 00:26:32.090
YOU NEED TO SOLVE.

00:26:32.157 --> 00:26:32.691
IMPORTANT PROBLEMS THAT ARE

00:26:32.757 --> 00:26:34.392
FACING THE INDUSTRY THAT ARE

00:26:34.459 --> 00:26:36.161
EITHER ACUTE PROBLEMS OR CHRONIC

00:26:36.227 --> 00:26:38.063
PROBLEMS.

00:26:38.129 --> 00:26:40.065
THAT NEED CONSTANT TENSION.

00:26:40.131 --> 00:26:42.200
THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE --

00:26:42.267 --> 00:26:44.135
USING WATER EFFICIENTLY WATER

00:26:44.202 --> 00:26:46.137
CALIFORNIA IS OBVIOUSLY A HUGE

00:26:46.204 --> 00:26:46.371
ISSUE.

00:26:46.438 --> 00:26:48.239
IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN -- AND WE

00:26:48.306 --> 00:26:50.642
HAVE RESEARCHERS ARE WORKING ON

00:26:50.709 --> 00:26:52.310
NEW WAYS OF USING WATER

00:26:52.377 --> 00:26:54.579
EFFICIENTLY WHETHER IT'S THROUGH

00:26:54.646 --> 00:26:56.381
NEW PLANTS. FOR NEW WAYS OF

00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:57.015
DISTRIBUTING WATER THROUGH THEN

00:26:57.082 --> 00:27:00.185
YOU'RE.

00:27:00.251 --> 00:27:00.919
BUT ALSO LONG TERM PROBLEMS LIKE

00:27:00.986 --> 00:27:02.420
DISEASES AND CONTROLLING

00:27:02.487 --> 00:27:02.921
DISEASES AND THAT'S VERY

00:27:02.988 --> 00:27:04.089
IMPORTANT AS WELL.

00:27:04.155 --> 00:27:06.524
MORE RECENTLY WE'VE HAD A HUGE

00:27:06.591 --> 00:27:08.460
ISSUES WITH THE WILDFIRES AS

00:27:08.526 --> 00:27:10.228
RICK MENTIONED.

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:10.829
AND YOU CAN SEE IN THE UPPER

00:27:10.895 --> 00:27:12.397
LEFT HAND CORNER.

00:27:12.464 --> 00:27:14.466
WHEN THOSE PROBLEMS STARTED

00:27:14.532 --> 00:27:18.203
HAPPENING AND AND -- TWO

00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:18.803
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NEED OVER

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.572
HOLSTER WHO'S THE PERSON IN THE

00:27:20.638 --> 00:27:22.574
MASK ON THE RATE THAT PICTURE.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.442
WAS OUR EXTENSION I'LL JUST JUMP

00:27:24.509 --> 00:27:28.146
RIGHT IN TO USE THAT TRAGEDY AS

00:27:28.213 --> 00:27:28.747
AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY STUDY

00:27:28.813 --> 00:27:34.185
WAYS OF MITIGATING SMOKE TAINTED.

00:27:34.252 --> 00:27:34.786
ONE WHERE AS WE GO AROUND THE

00:27:34.853 --> 00:27:35.420
STATE WE LOOK FOR WHAT ARE THE

00:27:35.487 --> 00:27:36.488
CRITICAL ISSUES FACING ONE

00:27:36.554 --> 00:27:38.556
MYSTERY FOR MANY YEARS IT WAS

00:27:38.623 --> 00:27:40.191
WATER.

00:27:40.258 --> 00:27:42.160
AND WATER IN WATER AND WATER --

OUR COURSES HAVE SOME KIND OF

00:29:39.777 --> 00:29:41.613
PRACTICAL ASPECT TO IT HERE IN

THE WINERY -- WHERE STUDENTS ARE

00:29:43.915 --> 00:29:45.783

ENTER THE INDUSTRY.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.060
I SHOULD SAY THAT IT'S IT'S

00:29:56.127 --> 00:29:57.729
IMPORTANT TO TO NOTE THAT THE

00:29:57.795 --> 00:29:59.731
STUDENTS ARE STUDENTS BECOME

00:29:59.797 --> 00:30:01.666

WITH ONE STREET HAS ON ON

00:30:13.578 --> 00:30:21.419
CALIFORNIA AND ON THE COUNTRY.

00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:22.020
THE THIRD PART OF THIRD CORE

00:30:22.086 --> 00:30:23.555
MISSION THAT WE HAVE IS

00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:25.590
EXTENSION AND THAT'S THE IDEA OF

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:27.825
CONTINUING EDUCATION -- IF WE

00:30:27.892 --> 00:30:28.426
JUST DO RESEARCH AND WE DON'T

00:30:28.493 --> 00:30:30.195
TELL ANYBODY ABOUT IT DOESN'T

00:30:30.261 --> 00:30:31.930
REALLY DO ANYBODY ANY GOOD SO

00:30:31.996 --> 00:30:32.597
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY

00:30:32.664 --> 00:30:34.299
FOCUS ON IS HOW TO GET THIS

00:30:34.365 --> 00:30:36.067
INFORMATION. TO STAKEHOLDERS

00:30:36.134 --> 00:30:36.367
THAT NEED.

00:30:36.434 --> 00:30:38.203
AND SO WE HAVE A DEDICATED TEAM

00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:41.773
THAT DOES THAT WE RUN ABOUT

00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:43.942
FIFTEEN OR MAYBE MORE --

00:30:44.008 --> 00:30:45.877
CONTINUE EDUCATION PROGRAMS A

00:30:46.544 --> 00:30:48.379
SCEPTRE HARVEST WE KNOW NOBODY'S

00:30:48.446 --> 00:30:52.183
GONNA GO -- AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:54.052
OF THOSE AROUND CAMPUS AND ONE

00:30:54.118 --> 00:30:54.752
THIRD WE TRAVEL AROUND THE STATE

00:30:54.819 --> 00:30:56.321
TO THE MAIN GROWING REGIONS TO

00:30:56.387 --> 00:30:58.256
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE REACHING

00:30:58.323 --> 00:30:58.856
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THAT

00:30:58.923 --> 00:31:00.091
INFORMATION THE STATE.

00:31:00.158 --> 00:31:02.227
THIS IS SPECIALLY IMPORTANT --

00:31:02.293 --> 00:31:04.195
TO NOW IS -- THERE'S SOME

00:31:04.262 --> 00:31:08.099
TRANSITION AND UC ANR AND THE I.

00:31:08.166 --> 00:31:12.003
IN THERE ARE SOME KEY -- SOME

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.138
KEY -- GROWING AREAS IN THE

00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:16.241
STATE THE HAVE HAD RETIREMENTS

00:31:16.307 --> 00:31:18.142
OF THE FOREMAN VISORS IN THOSE

00:31:18.209 --> 00:31:20.178
FORMER VISORS HAVE NOT YET BEEN

00:31:20.245 --> 00:31:20.845
REPLACED SINCE NOT CLEAR WHEN OR

00:31:20.912 --> 00:31:22.313
IF THEY WILL BE.

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:26.718
IT IS A KEY ISSUE THAT I THINK

00:31:26.784 --> 00:31:28.519
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED -- BECAUSE

00:31:28.586 --> 00:31:29.087
THAT IS A KEY PART OF THE

00:31:29.153 --> 00:31:30.888
EXTENSION TO TURN CONTINUING THE

00:31:30.955 --> 00:31:32.457
CUSTOMER FACULTY.

00:31:32.523 --> 00:31:34.759

00:31:40.598 --> 00:31:42.700
ARE WE ALSO HAVE GREAT

00:31:42.767 --> 00:31:44.936
FACILITIES -- THIS IS A PICTURE

00:31:45.003 --> 00:31:46.804
OF OUR TEACHING RESEARCH WINERY

00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:47.372
I KNOW SOME OF YOU HAVE SEEN

00:31:47.438 --> 00:31:49.140

00:31:50.875 --> 00:31:50.975
IT.

00:31:51.042 --> 00:31:51.643
IT'S THE MOST ADVANCED THE MOST

00:31:51.709 --> 00:31:54.779
SUSTAINABLE WINERY IN THE WORLD --

00:31:54.846 --> 00:31:56.948

00:32:10.828 --> 00:32:11.329
ENTER WELL AS THEY'VE BEEN

00:32:11.396 --> 00:32:14.732
DESIGNING THEIR FACILITIES.

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:16.734
I THINK THAT'S GREAT.

00:32:16.801 --> 00:32:17.235
I SHOULD MENTION AT THIS

00:32:17.302 --> 00:32:19.170
FACILITY BETWEEN THE BUILDING

00:32:19.237 --> 00:32:19.737
AND THE EQUIPMENT WAS ABOUT

00:32:19.804 --> 00:32:21.372
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS --

00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:22.006
PRIVATELY FUNDED THERE WAS NO

00:32:22.073 --> 00:32:25.576
STATE MONEY PUT INTO THE M. OPEN

00:32:25.643 --> 00:32:27.712
UP ONE OTHER KEY FACILITY ONE

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:29.380
TALK ABOUT IS THAT -- FOLKS FOR

00:32:29.447 --> 00:32:31.349
MENTAL STATION.

00:32:31.416 --> 00:32:33.484
AND FILL IN NAPA VALLEY -- THIS

00:32:33.551 --> 00:32:35.920
IS A THERE ARE VERY FEW -- FIFTY

00:32:35.987 --> 00:32:37.622
UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD

00:32:37.689 --> 00:32:37.922
WHO HAVE.

00:32:37.989 --> 00:32:41.526
VINEYARDS IN REALLY KEY GROWING

00:32:41.592 --> 00:32:43.661
REGIONS SO WE'RE VERY LUCKY TO

00:32:43.728 --> 00:32:47.365
HAVE HAD THIS SINCE -- ABOUT --

00:32:47.432 --> 00:32:49.334
NINETEEN FIFTY N..

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.369
REALLY IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE IS

00:32:51.436 --> 00:32:53.304
COMING OUT OF THERE FROM --

00:32:53.371 --> 00:32:54.005

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.011
SO WITH THAT I JUST LIKE TO

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:01.646
CONCLUDE BY SAYING THAT I THINK

00:33:01.713 --> 00:33:02.280
THERE'S IT'S NOT AN ACCIDENT

00:33:02.347 --> 00:33:05.416

FROM THIS REGION AND WHEN I

ARRIVED INTO THE U. S. I WAS

00:34:06.077 --> 00:34:07.645
FEELING PRETTY CHUFFED WITH

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:07.879

THE U. K. WITH THEM.

00:34:17.688 --> 00:34:19.624
AND THEN MOVED INTO A VARIETY OF

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.526
COMMERCIAL ROLES.

00:34:21.592 --> 00:34:23.494

BE SOLVED THROUGH THE RESEARCHER

00:44:49.787 --> 00:44:53.157
ADVANCE OF RESEARCH --

00:44:53.223 --> 00:44:53.757
CALIFORNIA HAS A PLACE IN THE

00:44:53.824 --> 00:44:55.192
GLOBALLY.

00:44:55.259 --> 00:44:57.294
AS ONE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY

00:44:57.361 --> 00:44:59.296

00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:01.331
IN THE WORLD WERE ALSO THE US IS

00:45:01.398 --> 00:45:03.200
ALSO THE PLACE TO MARKET WINE.

00:45:03.267 --> 00:45:05.702
AND OUR INDUSTRY GOES UP AGAINST

00:45:05.769 --> 00:45:07.371
SOVEREIGN FUNDS THAT FUND

00:45:07.438 --> 00:45:11.241
RESEARCH AND MARKETING EFFORTS --

00:45:11.308 --> 00:45:13.143
BOTH IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:15.245
MARKET EFFORTS IN THE US SO

HAS COME VERY FAR I'M A PRODUCT

00:45:37.701 --> 00:45:41.839
OF THE CLASS SIZE WITH A CULTURE

00:45:41.905 --> 00:45:43.307
PROGRAM AT UC DAVIS.

00:45:43.373 --> 00:45:45.275
I FARMED FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS

00:45:45.342 --> 00:45:45.509
GRAPES.

00:45:45.576 --> 00:45:47.411
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HERE.

00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:49.413
AND OF WE HAVE MOVED INTO -- THE

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:53.317
TECHNICAL SIDE AND ALSO THE

00:45:53.383 --> 00:45:55.285
SALES SIDE OF THE WIND.

00:45:55.352 --> 00:45:57.321
SO I WANTED TO TALK SPECIFICALLY

00:45:57.387 --> 00:45:59.389
ABOUT -- TWO HIGHLIGHT TWO KEY

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:01.391
INNOVATION TRANS THAT I FEEL

00:46:01.458 --> 00:46:03.527
LIKE OUR OPPORTUNITIES AND MAYBE

00:46:03.594 --> 00:46:03.727
EVEN.

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:07.464
OUR OBLIGATION -- TO INCREASE

00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:09.533
RESEARCH FUNDING FOR I'M THE

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:13.303
FIRST ONE IS THE ADVANCE.

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:13.871
THE GREAT ADVANCEMENTS IN

00:46:13.937 --> 00:46:15.706
GENETIC RESEARCH -- TECHNIQUES

00:46:15.772 --> 00:46:19.409
THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED -- FOR

00:46:19.476 --> 00:46:21.545
THE HUMAN GENOME ARE BEING MOVED

00:46:21.612 --> 00:46:25.282
INTO -- UNLOCKING THE GENOME OF

00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.782
NOT ONLY GRAPEVINES AND

00:46:25.849 --> 00:46:27.317
CULTIVARS.

00:46:27.384 --> 00:46:29.286
BUT ALSO GREAT FUN PEST AND

00:46:29.353 --> 00:46:29.887
DISEASES AND I BELIEVE THAT'S

00:46:29.953 --> 00:46:33.390
WHERE THE PROBLEM LIES.

00:46:33.457 --> 00:46:35.592
AND CONTROL WHEN MAKING MORE

00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:37.427
ECONOMICALLY VIABLE OUR

00:46:37.494 --> 00:46:39.496
VINEYARDS BY WORKING ON THE

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:41.565
HOUSE -- THERE THE WE'RE JUST

00:46:41.632 --> 00:46:43.367
BEGINNING TO APPLY THESE NEW

00:46:43.433 --> 00:46:43.901
TECHNIQUES. TO SOLVE MAJOR

00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:49.640
CHALLENGES -- AND THERE IS A

00:46:49.706 --> 00:46:51.742
GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY

00:46:51.808 --> 00:46:53.510
REDUCE OR EVEN ELIMINATE THE USE

00:46:53.577 --> 00:46:55.512
OF PESTICIDES BASED ON THE

00:46:55.579 --> 00:46:57.381
UNDERSTANDING OF GENETICS ABOUT

00:46:57.447 --> 00:46:59.816
THE THE THE VINES AND THE IN THE

00:46:59.883 --> 00:47:01.418
PAST.

00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:01.985
THE OTHER AREA IS IT IS ONE

00:47:02.052 --> 00:47:03.420
WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH.

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:05.689
AND AND THAT IS -- THE USE OF

00:47:05.756 --> 00:47:07.424
DATA.

00:47:07.491 --> 00:47:09.493
AND USE IT EVERY DAY ON YOUR

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.562
PHONE BUT BUT IN OUR UNIVERSE

00:47:11.628 --> 00:47:13.397
IT'S PRECISION FARMING.

00:47:13.463 --> 00:47:17.401
AND PRECISION FARMING -- IS A

00:47:17.467 --> 00:47:18.035
TERM THAT'S USED TO AND THAT'S

00:47:18.101 --> 00:47:19.603
IT'S BEEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF AND

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:21.405
GRAIN CROPS.

00:47:21.471 --> 00:47:23.507
CROPS ARE PLANTED EVERY YEAR.

00:47:23.574 --> 00:47:27.544
IT'S A LOT HARDER AND PERENNIAL

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:29.379
CROPS ONES WITH A PHYSICAL

00:47:29.446 --> 00:47:30.013
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT STAY UP YEAR

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:30.314
AFTER YEAR.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.648
YOUR THREE YEAR -- SO WHAT IT

00:47:31.715 --> 00:47:33.684
REALLY MEANS IS RIGHT NOW WE

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:34.284
MANAGE OUR VINEYARD BLOCKS AND

00:47:34.351 --> 00:47:35.419
IN.

00:47:35.485 --> 00:47:37.654
BASICALLY TWENTY ACRE BLOCKS

00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:38.222
WHATEVER SIZE THE BLOCK IS

00:47:38.288 --> 00:47:41.558
SOMETIMES MORE SOMETIMES LARGER.

00:47:41.625 --> 00:47:43.627
WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY NOW TO

00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:45.896
COLLECT DATA AT THE VINE LEVEL

00:47:45.963 --> 00:47:49.399
FIVE LINE SO FOR EXAMPLE AND AT

00:47:49.466 --> 00:47:49.800
SIDE WHEN YOU'RE.

00:47:49.866 --> 00:47:51.635
WE KNOW THE YIELD OFF OF EVERY

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:53.437
VINE BY USING.

00:47:53.503 --> 00:47:53.971
RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD

00:47:54.037 --> 00:47:55.672
TECHNOLOGY THAT HUESO FRUIT

00:47:55.739 --> 00:47:57.574
COMING OFF.

00:47:57.641 --> 00:47:58.175
I CAN BEAR WHEN THE VINE IS

00:47:58.242 --> 00:47:59.810
HARVESTED.

00:47:59.876 --> 00:48:00.444
AND WE USE THAT IS OUR REPORT

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:02.412
CARD FOR ALL THE INPUTS WE DID

00:48:02.479 --> 00:48:06.216
DURING THE YEAR.

00:48:06.283 --> 00:48:06.817
AND I I WANT TO JUST KIND OF

00:48:06.883 --> 00:48:07.417
GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT THIS

00:48:07.484 --> 00:48:10.420
PROMISES -- WE USE THAT AS ONE

00:48:10.487 --> 00:48:10.954
PIECE OF DATA AND THEN

00:48:11.021 --> 00:48:12.289
EVERYTHING WE PUT IN.

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:14.625
WE USE IS -- OTHER LAYERS OF

00:48:14.691 --> 00:48:16.526
DATA FROM STUFF THAT DOESN'T

00:48:16.593 --> 00:48:17.160
CHANGE MUCH WHAT'S GOING ON IN

00:48:17.227 --> 00:48:18.328
THE SOIL.

00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:20.564
BUT THERE'S THE LABOR AND PARTS --

00:48:20.631 --> 00:48:22.399
WE NOW HAVE MACHINES THAT WILL

00:48:22.466 --> 00:48:22.933
TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.434
WITHOUT.

00:48:24.501 --> 00:48:26.570
INDIVIDUAL MANAGEMENT BUT JUST

00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:28.438
WHAT THEY DO TO THE VINE.

00:48:28.505 --> 00:48:34.378
WHETHER THEY'RE SPRAYING OR OR

00:48:34.444 --> 00:48:36.413
LEAVE BURYING OUR SHOOT SENDING.

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.047
THAT'S PRECISION FARMING AND AND

00:48:37.114 --> 00:48:38.682
IF WE CAN GET A 10% INCREASE.

00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:40.851
IN YIELD AND I AND OR JUST IN

00:48:40.917 --> 00:48:42.419
THE TYPE OF FRUIT WE WANT.

00:48:42.486 --> 00:48:43.020
IF WE CAN TAKE A LOW YIELDING

00:48:43.086 --> 00:48:44.588
VINES AND RAISE THEM UP THE

00:48:44.655 --> 00:48:45.188
HIGHLIGHT YIELDING VINES AND

00:48:45.255 --> 00:48:46.423
BRING THEM DOWN.

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:48.692
THAT'S 10% ON IT ON IT CHRIS

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:49.293
LIKE SHY THAT'S FOUR HUNDRED

00:48:49.359 --> 00:48:50.827
ADDITIONAL ACRES THAT WE DON'T

00:48:50.894 --> 00:48:52.829
HAVE TO PLANT THAT WE DON'T HAVE

00:48:52.896 --> 00:48:54.431
TO SPRAY.

00:48:54.498 --> 00:48:56.700
FERTILIZE WATER WHICH JUST DOING

00:48:56.767 --> 00:49:00.470
BETTER HONOR JUST INFORMING AND

00:49:00.537 --> 00:49:02.439
THAT'S NOT.

00:49:02.506 --> 00:49:03.006
THE FANTASY THAT'S HAPPENING

00:49:03.073 --> 00:49:04.441
RIGHT NOW.

00:49:04.508 --> 00:49:04.975
JUST IN DIFFERENT STAGES.

00:49:05.042 --> 00:49:06.743
RIGHT NOW ONLY THE BIGGER

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.679
COMPANIES -- GALLO'S STRIDE

00:49:08.745 --> 00:49:10.781
COMPANIES THAT ARE INNOVATIVE

00:49:10.847 --> 00:49:12.749
AND AND INVEST IN RESEARCH CAN

00:49:12.816 --> 00:49:14.518
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.

00:49:14.584 --> 00:49:16.753
BY FINDING THAT -- DIRECTLY BY

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.955
FINDING DR BLOCKS PROGRAMS AND

00:49:19.022 --> 00:49:20.657
OTHER PROGRAMS AROUND -- THE

00:49:20.724 --> 00:49:23.160
STATE WE CAN BRING THAT TO EVERY

00:49:23.226 --> 00:49:28.398
FARMER THOSE CHALLENGES ARE REAL --

00:49:28.465 --> 00:49:28.799
OUR LABOR COSTS.

00:49:28.865 --> 00:49:30.967
THE COST OF FARM INVENTOR FROM

00:49:31.034 --> 00:49:32.736
WHEN I STARTED INSIDE AND NOW IS

00:49:32.803 --> 00:49:34.538
UP 50%.

00:49:34.604 --> 00:49:36.740
BASICALLY FROM FOUR THOUSAND

00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:37.140
DOLLARS AN ACRE.

00:49:37.207 --> 00:49:38.575
TO SIX THOUSAND THE THE LABOR

00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:40.811
COSTS JUST MANDATED LABOR RATES.

00:49:40.877 --> 00:49:42.813
ARE GOING TO CREATE A 40%

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:44.881
INCREASE BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:49:44.948 --> 00:49:48.518
I'M JUST A DIRECT COST OF LABOR --

00:49:48.585 --> 00:49:49.119
THE OTHER PART IS OUR LABOR

00:49:49.186 --> 00:49:52.522
FORCES EIJI.

00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:54.791
AND AND THERE'S WE WOULD NEED TO

00:49:54.858 --> 00:49:55.359
BRING NEW PEOPLE AND THESE

00:49:55.425 --> 00:49:55.992
PEOPLE NEED TO BE ABLE TO USE A

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:56.626
LAPTOP.

00:49:56.693 --> 00:49:58.929
AND EVERY MACHINE WE HAVE NOW

00:49:58.995 --> 00:50:02.699
HAS A COMPUTER AND SO SO WITH

00:50:02.766 --> 00:50:03.300
THAT YOU CAN I GET THE PICTURE

00:50:03.367 --> 00:50:04.634
RIGHT THERE'S LOTS OF

00:50:04.701 --> 00:50:06.603
OPPORTUNITY OUT THERE -- IT'S

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:07.204
NOT SCIENCE FICTION IT'S REAL

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:08.905
THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING AND

00:50:08.972 --> 00:50:11.074
WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO TO YOU

00:50:11.141 --> 00:50:12.642
KNOW.

00:50:12.709 --> 00:50:14.678

00:50:14.745 --> 00:50:16.747
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY -- HAVE

00:50:16.813 --> 00:50:18.882

CHANGING CLIMATE [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:19.516 --> 00:50:22.519
YEAH AND QUALITY RESEARCH CAN

00:50:22.586 --> 00:50:23.220
ONLY BE ACHIEVED WITH CONSISTENT

00:50:23.286 --> 00:50:24.955
AND RELIABLE FUNDING.

00:50:25.021 --> 00:50:26.957
AND THE ATF HAS BEEN AROUND FOR

00:50:27.023 --> 00:50:28.892
FORTY YEARS SELF FUNDING.

00:50:28.959 --> 00:50:34.664
RESEARCH -- DRIVEN BY INDUSTRY

00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:36.633
VOLUNTEER.

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.969
FALLING TEARS IT FROM THE

00:50:39.035 --> 00:50:40.904
RESEARCH WHY IT GOT LINES

00:50:40.971 --> 00:50:44.608
BECAUSE AFTER FEDERAL FUNDS --

LIVE AS WELL AS USE TODAY'S I

00:51:57.948 --> 00:51:59.349
LIVE RIGHT BY THE RESEARCH

00:51:59.416 --> 00:52:01.284
CENTER FOR THE GRAPES AND THEY

00:52:01.351 --> 00:52:03.253
HAVE THE LIBRARY THERE.

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.322
AND I WAS JUST THERE FOR W. LOOK

00:52:05.388 --> 00:52:05.956
A DINNER THE OTHER DAY FOR THE

AND THEN THE SPENT TWO HUNDRED

00:52:09.659 --> 00:52:11.261
PEOPLE ON A LONG TABLE.

00:52:11.328 --> 00:52:13.296
AND WE HAD A INCREDIBLE --

00:52:13.363 --> 00:52:13.897
EDUCATION THAT DAY ABOUT THE

00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:15.599
IMPORTANCE OF THIS LIBRARY THEY

00:52:15.665 --> 00:52:17.601
HAVE THEIR AND THE YEAR BEFORE

00:52:17.667 --> 00:52:19.369
THEY SAID THEY WERE THE NUMBER

00:52:19.436 --> 00:52:19.703
ONE LIBRARY.

00:52:19.769 --> 00:52:21.471
THEY SAID THEY'VE NOW OR NUMBER

00:52:21.538 --> 00:52:23.440
TWO AND I WAS JUST CURIOUS HOW

00:52:23.507 --> 00:52:25.275
DO YOU GO TO NUMBER.

00:52:25.342 --> 00:52:25.909
TWO BUT I WAS YOU KNOW CURIOUS

00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:27.611
LIKE HOW DID THAT HAPPEN WAS IT.

00:52:27.677 --> 00:52:29.613
I'M JUST NEW BREEDS ARE -- TYPES

00:52:29.679 --> 00:52:33.783
OF ROOTS DOCTOR COMING OUT NOW

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:38.154
OR AS A YOU KNOW.

00:52:38.221 --> 00:52:38.555
WHY WORRY ABOUT?

00:52:38.622 --> 00:52:40.524
ALL THE GREAT ALL THE GREAT BREW

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:42.359
US DOCTORS OUT THERE I THINK

00:52:42.425 --> 00:52:44.394
EVERY SINGLE -- GRAPES IT'S EVER

00:52:44.461 --> 00:52:48.331
BEEN GROWN IS OUT AT THAT WE'LL

00:52:48.398 --> 00:52:50.233
SKILL RANCH [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.135
YEAH.

00:52:52.202 --> 00:52:54.471
I'M NOT SURE HOW THOSE THINGS --

00:52:54.538 --> 00:52:58.308
RANKED -- BUT CERTAINLY THAT

00:52:58.375 --> 00:53:00.544
KIND OF POSITIVE WORRY FOR PLANT

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:02.445
MATERIALS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL SO

00:53:02.512 --> 00:53:04.281
YOU KNOW WITH WHICH HI

00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:06.216
FOUNDATION SERVICES OR ANDY

00:53:06.283 --> 00:53:08.451
WALKERS BREEDING PROGRAM IN OUR

00:53:08.518 --> 00:53:10.387
DEPARTMENT -- THOSE KIND OF

00:53:10.453 --> 00:53:14.024
RESOURCES -- REALLY EXPENSIVE

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:14.624
BUT ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO

00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:16.192
COMING UP WITH.

00:53:16.259 --> 00:53:20.130
PLANT MATERIAL THAT'S THAT WILL

00:53:20.196 --> 00:53:20.764
LEAD TO DISEASE RESISTANCE OR

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:22.465
DROUGHT TOLERANCE OR SMALL

00:53:22.532 --> 00:53:24.401
TOLERANCE OR ANY OTHER THINGS WE

00:53:24.467 --> 00:53:24.601
NEED.

00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:26.937
I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY HOW THAT'S

00:53:27.003 --> 00:53:28.772
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:53:28.838 --> 00:53:30.907
SO I JUST WANTED TO GIVE A SHOUT

00:53:30.974 --> 00:53:32.809
OUT ON THAT NOTE TO UC DAVIS

00:53:32.876 --> 00:53:33.009
WHEN.

00:53:33.076 --> 00:53:34.878
I WAS ON MY PROGRAM WE WENT TO

00:53:34.945 --> 00:53:38.815
CROATIA AND WE VISITED THE

00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:39.282
UNIVERSITY OF RABIN.

00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:42.852
AND THEY HAD -- TO WORKED VERY

00:53:42.919 --> 00:53:44.921
CLOSELY WITH UC DAVIS TO

00:53:44.988 --> 00:53:47.223
IDENTIFY THE GENEALOGY OF

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:49.192
TRINIDAD.

00:53:49.259 --> 00:53:51.494
AND SO I I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY --

00:53:51.561 --> 00:53:53.430
PROUD MOMENT FOR US TO BE IN A

00:53:53.496 --> 00:53:55.498
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT COUNTRY AND

00:53:55.565 --> 00:53:57.500
TO HAVE SUCH RECOGNITION SO IT

00:53:57.567 --> 00:53:59.235
REALLY IS GLOBALLY RECOGNIZED

00:53:59.302 --> 00:53:59.636
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:53:59.703 --> 00:54:01.271
WELL DONE.

00:54:01.338 --> 00:54:03.640
AND THE GENETIC I THE GENETIC

00:54:03.707 --> 00:54:05.308
RESEARCH I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ON

00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:07.510
I THINK THAT'S A REALLY

00:54:07.577 --> 00:54:08.144
IMPORTANT PIECE THAT WE SHOULD

00:54:08.211 --> 00:54:08.311
BE.

00:54:08.378 --> 00:54:09.546
FUNDING THAT KIND OF RESEARCH --

00:54:09.613 --> 00:54:11.648
WE'VE DONE -- WHEN YOU TALK

00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:13.650
ABOUT PAST -- AND DISEASE.

00:54:13.717 --> 00:54:15.719
WE FOUND OUT THROUGH THE

00:54:15.785 --> 00:54:17.420
DEPARTMENT -- CALIFORNIA PART OF

00:54:17.487 --> 00:54:18.121
PESTICIDE REGULATION THAT WE HAD

00:54:18.188 --> 00:54:19.723
REQUESTED THEM TO DO SOME NEW

00:54:19.789 --> 00:54:21.858
BIO DIVERSITY TYPE THINGS WITH --

00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:23.393
PAST.

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:25.729
AS I HELPED GET THE FUNDED.

00:54:25.795 --> 00:54:27.397
AND FOUND OUT.

00:54:27.464 --> 00:54:29.466
THEY HADN'T DONE ONE THING WITH

00:54:29.532 --> 00:54:29.633
IT.

00:54:29.699 --> 00:54:30.300
SO WE'VE BEEN SENSE AND HAD THEM

00:54:30.367 --> 00:54:31.601
IN OUR OFFICE TO SAY WHAT

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:33.737
HAPPENED TO THOSE PEOPLE WERE

00:54:33.803 --> 00:54:35.338
WORKING ON SPECIFICALLY ON

00:54:35.405 --> 00:54:35.905
TRYING TO REDUCE THE USE OF

00:54:35.972 --> 00:54:37.374
PESTICIDES.

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.442
HERBICIDES ETCETERA AND SO I

00:54:39.509 --> 00:54:41.344
WHAT YOU CAN BE ASSURED THAT WE

00:54:41.411 --> 00:54:42.045
ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON IT BECAUSE

00:54:42.112 --> 00:54:43.713
IT IS IMPORTANT TO REDUCE.

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:49.519
OF THOSE TYPES OF A OF CHEMICALS

00:54:49.586 --> 00:54:49.886
OF FOUR CROPS.

00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:51.988
AND LASTLY IT'S BEEN AMAZING IN

00:54:52.055 --> 00:54:53.657
THE SHORT TIME THAT I'VE BEEN IN

00:54:53.723 --> 00:54:55.358
THE LEGISLATURES OF THE TRAINING

00:54:55.425 --> 00:54:55.892
MY OTHER COLLEAGUES FROM

00:54:55.959 --> 00:54:57.727
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE

00:54:57.794 --> 00:54:59.396
IMPORTANCE OF WHAT.

00:54:59.462 --> 00:55:01.398
IT TAKES TO BE A FARMER.

00:55:01.464 --> 00:55:01.998
AND SO ARE YOU YOU -- HIT A

00:55:02.065 --> 00:55:03.800
NERVE WITH ME WHICH IS A GOOD

WHAT IS IN REGARDS TO THE TO THE

00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:03.813

OVERSEAS TO WALK US THROUGH IF

00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:15.525
YOU LOOK OVER THE LAST TWENTY

00:58:15.592 --> 00:58:17.126
YEARS.

00:58:17.193 --> 00:58:17.727
BIGGEST CHANGE WE THINK WE'RE

00:58:17.794 --> 00:58:18.228
GOING IN REGARD TO THAT

00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:21.130
EXPERIENCE.

00:58:21.197 --> 00:58:21.698
AND IT ALSO TALK WITH ABOUT

00:58:21.764 --> 00:58:23.132
LOYALTY.

00:58:23.199 --> 00:58:23.766
ARE YOU SEEING FOLKS STUCK WITH

00:58:23.833 --> 00:58:25.134
ONE BRAND.

00:58:25.201 --> 00:58:27.170
ARE YOU SEEING FOLKS DOING --

00:58:27.237 --> 00:58:31.507
PRICE TAG SHOP IN WHAT IS THAT.

00:58:31.574 --> 00:58:33.509
I THAT YOU SEEN ACROSS THE BOARD.

00:58:33.576 --> 00:58:34.177
THAT'S A PRETTY LOADED QUESTION.

00:58:34.244 --> 00:58:35.979
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT MARKET YOU'RE

00:58:36.045 --> 00:58:37.480
REALLY LOOKING FOR SPECIFICALLY

00:58:37.547 --> 00:58:38.081
AT HIGH TO STAY WHERE A SMALL

00:58:38.147 --> 00:58:40.083
BOUTIQUE FAMILY OWNED FAMILY RUN

00:58:40.149 --> 00:58:41.517
WINERY.

00:58:41.584 --> 00:58:43.486
SO THAT'S TYPE OF THAT CUSTOMERS

00:58:43.553 --> 00:58:44.053
THAT WE'RE GETTING WE'RE NOT

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.855
DOING FOOD PAIRINGS WORD NOT

00:58:45.922 --> 00:58:48.491
HAVING LARGE TOWARDS OR NOT JEAN

00:58:48.558 --> 00:58:49.125
BACHELORETTES WE'RE TRYING TO

00:58:49.192 --> 00:58:50.426
GET ONE I. ONE VERY FOCUSED

00:58:50.493 --> 00:58:52.028
EDUCATIONAL WITH.

00:58:52.095 --> 00:58:53.897
WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE VINEYARD

00:58:53.963 --> 00:58:54.597
AND HOW THAT'S SHOWCASING IN THE

00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:56.399
CLASS OF ONE THIRTY STEVEN?

00:58:56.466 --> 00:58:58.334
SO THAT'S OUR EXPERIENCE NOT THE

00:58:58.401 --> 00:58:59.002
CLIENTELE WERE GETTING WHEN IT

00:58:59.068 --> 00:59:00.570
COMES TO LOYALTY ONCE THEY

00:59:00.637 --> 00:59:02.372
BECOME A MEMBER OF OURS AND

00:59:02.438 --> 00:59:04.040
THEY'RE USUALLY.

00:59:04.107 --> 00:59:04.641
I WOULD HOPE FOR A LONG TIME

00:59:04.707 --> 00:59:06.009
WE'VE BEEN OPEN FOR TWO YEARS

00:59:06.075 --> 00:59:07.877
BUT WE GET PEOPLE WHO KNOW US

00:59:07.944 --> 00:59:08.511
THEY KNOW US BY NAME THEY KNOW

00:59:08.578 --> 00:59:10.313
MY FATHER IN LAW MY MOTHER IN

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:14.117
LAW THEY THEY HAVE AN EXPERIENCE

00:59:14.183 --> 00:59:14.651
WHERE THEY FEEL LIKE THEIR

00:59:14.717 --> 00:59:16.286
FAMILY WITHOUT HER INVESTED.

00:59:16.352 --> 00:59:18.087
THEIR INVESTED WITH US AND WHAT

00:59:18.154 --> 00:59:18.721
I'M SHOWCASING AND I'VE SEEN IS

00:59:18.788 --> 00:59:19.389
THAT I'M GETTING A LOT PEOPLE MY

00:59:19.455 --> 00:59:20.456
AGE OR YOUNGER WHO ARE.

00:59:20.523 --> 00:59:22.258
COMING UP FROM SAN FRANCISCO

00:59:22.325 --> 00:59:24.093
DON'T WANT TO GO ALL THE WAY AT

00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:24.761
VALLEY THEY THEY WANT SOMETHING

00:59:24.827 --> 00:59:26.462
THAT'S NOT THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR

00:59:26.529 --> 00:59:28.231
BOTTLE CAPS THEY'RE ENJOYING A

00:59:28.298 --> 00:59:28.865
PIANO AND CHARDONNAY BUT IT A

00:59:28.932 --> 00:59:30.333
DECENT PRICE.

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.268
SO I THINK IT REALLY DEPENDS ON

00:59:32.335 --> 00:59:32.869
EACH WINERY IN EAT WHAT EACH

00:59:32.936 --> 00:59:34.237
PERSON LOOKING TO GIVE.

00:59:34.304 --> 00:59:36.105

00:59:57.427 --> 00:59:58.528
EAST COASTER.

00:59:58.594 --> 01:00:01.197
LET'S FACE IT WE'RE NOT VERY

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:01.631
SUSTAINABLE PEOPLE.

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:03.333
IT IS NOT FOR ME WHEN I

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:05.168
AGRICULTURE WHAT'S DIFFERENT --

SO FOR US IT'S IT'S VERY

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:06.336
IMPORTANT FOR US TO LET PEOPLE

KNOW THAT WE ARE ORGANIC THAT WE

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:09.305

TO HAVE SUSTAINABILITY WE ARE

01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:17.113

FOUND IN THE PASSING YEARS IS

01:00:43.239 --> 01:00:45.241
THAT PEOPLE REALLY ARE

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:47.110
INTERESTED IN TRYING TO HIT?

01:00:47.176 --> 01:00:49.145
FIVE OR SIX WINERIES IN ONE DAY

01:00:49.212 --> 01:00:49.812
THEY ARE INVESTING MORE OF THEIR

01:00:49.879 --> 01:00:53.249
TIME AND THEY DO YOU WANT A MORE

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:55.251

01:01:09.532 --> 01:01:11.434
MORE TRICKY TO CAPTURE AND AND

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:15.104
KEEP THE OIL I THINK THERE'S A

01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:17.173
GREAT DEAL OF A THRIVING FOR

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.375
EXPERIMENTATION WITH THAT THAT

01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:21.611
SET -- SO WE DO INVEST A LOT OF

01:01:21.677 --> 01:01:23.279
TIME IN OUR OWN INTERNAL

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:25.214
RESEARCH ON WHAT RESONATES WITH

01:01:25.281 --> 01:01:27.116
THOSE ON THE SETS BECAUSE

01:01:27.183 --> 01:01:29.185
ULTIMATELY THEY WILL BECOME OUR

01:01:29.252 --> 01:01:31.187
LOYAL ONE CONSUME AS A FUTURE SO --

01:01:31.254 --> 01:01:33.589
WE ARE SEVENTY FIVE YEARS OLD

01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:35.491
NOW WE'VE WE TAKE PRIDE IN BEING

01:01:35.558 --> 01:01:37.427
THE FIRST WINERY BUT WE HAVE TO

01:01:37.493 --> 01:01:39.395
STAY NIMBLE AND HAVE TO BE

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:39.662
FLEXIBLE.

01:01:39.729 --> 01:01:43.166
AND JUST BE AHEAD OF THE GAME --

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:45.535
GIVEN THE AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF

01:01:45.601 --> 01:01:49.138
COMPETITION.

01:01:49.205 --> 01:01:49.739
IN THE QUESTION DESIGNED FOR

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:51.407
SUSTAINABILITY HOW MUCH DOES

01:01:51.474 --> 01:01:52.075
THAT PLAY INTO THE MESSAGES WELL

01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:53.776
RIGHT AS FAR AS YOUR MISSION.

01:01:53.843 --> 01:01:55.545
AND THE OTHER PIECES SO -- ARE

01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:57.547
YOU FINDING YOUNGER CONSUMERS

01:01:57.613 --> 01:01:59.649
ARE MORE FOCUSED ON WHAT IF IT'S

01:01:59.715 --> 01:02:01.918
NOT GONNA BE I'M MAKING THIS UP

01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:03.686
ONE OR TWO BRANDS THAT THEY LIKE.

01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:05.621
WHAT DO THEY WANT?

01:02:05.688 --> 01:02:07.490
I THINK THEY WANT A SENSE OF

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:08.124
ADVENTURE -- AND I THINK THEY

01:02:08.191 --> 01:02:11.527
THEY GET THAT FROM HAVING THAT

01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:13.563
EXPERIENCE AROUND ONE AND HAVING

01:02:13.629 --> 01:02:14.197
THAT MOMENT THAT THEY CAN TAKE

01:02:14.263 --> 01:02:17.767
BACK HOME TO SAIL WHEN I WAS A

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:19.569
CHILD COULD I GET THIS -- SO I

01:02:19.635 --> 01:02:21.404
THINK IT IS -- IT'S COMBINING

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:23.673
THAT THAT ONE MOMENT AND TAKEN

01:02:23.739 --> 01:02:26.042
AT HOME -- SUSTAINABILITY FOR US

01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:28.311
WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL STATE AND SO

01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:30.113
WE AUTOMATICALLY BENEFIT FROM

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:31.814
THE FEELING OF SUSTAINABILITY

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:34.050
FOR PEOPLE WHO VISIT THE STATE --

01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:37.787
SO IT IT DOES RESONATE -- AS

01:02:37.854 --> 01:02:40.123
WELL AS THE TALE OF OF HAVING A

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:41.991
WINERY THAT'S WITHSTOOD THE TEST

01:02:42.058 --> 01:02:42.525
OF TIME AND THE DIFFERENT

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:44.193
CHALLENGES IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:46.162
AND CLIMATE CHALLENGES THAT WE

01:02:46.229 --> 01:02:48.331
HAVE SO -- WE'RE WE'RE EXCITED

01:02:48.397 --> 01:02:53.970
ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF BEING ABLE.

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:54.637
TO MAKE MORE OF OUR I STAYED IN

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:57.874
DIFFERENT WAYS.

01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:00.209
MIKE IF I COULD IS SENATE

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:02.345
REQUIRE IF I COULD ADD -- IN

01:03:02.411 --> 01:03:05.848
ADDITION -- TO WHAT CLAIRE.

01:03:05.915 --> 01:03:07.917
AND SHANNON SHARED THE THE THIS

01:03:07.984 --> 01:03:08.551
ISSUE THAT YOU BRING UP ABOUT

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:10.253
LOYALTY IS IS A CHALLENGING ONE

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:12.054
TO OVERCOME RIGHT.

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:13.990
AND AND HOW DO YOU SOLVE FOR

01:03:14.056 --> 01:03:15.925
THAT SO ONE OF THE RESEARCH

01:03:15.992 --> 01:03:17.894
PROJECTS WE'VE HAD HAS LOOKED AT

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.062
THE DATA THAT JUST EXIST AT THE

01:03:20.129 --> 01:03:21.931
WINERY DURING THE WINERY

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:22.498
EXPERIENCE WHAT DO WE LEARN

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:24.267
ABOUT THAT CUSTOMER SO THAT WE

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:26.335
CAN BETTER BE ABLE TO GIVE THAT

01:03:26.402 --> 01:03:28.004
BACK WHAT IT.

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:28.337
IS THEY LIVE.

01:03:28.404 --> 01:03:30.006
SO THAT THAT'S THAT'S ONE

01:03:30.072 --> 01:03:32.008
TRANCHE AND THEN THE SECOND IS --

01:03:32.074 --> 01:03:33.943
SUSTAINABILITY IS REALLY

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:34.544
IMPORTANT IN THE END WE SEE

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:36.312
PEOPLE STARTING TO FOCUS THEIR

01:03:36.379 --> 01:03:38.347
BUYING -- THE SIM CONNIE WINE

01:03:38.414 --> 01:03:38.981
GROWERS HAVE DONE SOME REALLY

01:03:39.048 --> 01:03:40.349
GOOD STUDIES ON THIS AND OUR

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:43.953
BOARD HAS ASKED US TO HELP.

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.122
DEFINE WHAT SUSTAINABILITY MEANS

01:03:46.189 --> 01:03:47.990
TO PEOPLE IN THEIR MINDS SO

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:48.591
THAT'S A FUTURE PROJECT THAT

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:52.261
WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON BECAUSE

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:56.232
IT'S THE DEFINITION IS IS TOUGH

01:03:56.299 --> 01:03:56.832
IF YOU ASK TEN PEOPLE YOU MAY

01:03:56.899 --> 01:03:57.466
NOT GET YOU WON'T GET THE SAME

01:03:57.533 --> 01:03:57.967
ANSWER.

01:03:58.034 --> 01:03:58.634
SO WE'D LIKE TO COME UP WITH A

01:03:58.701 --> 01:04:00.369
WAY TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:01.971
THAT THAT WOULD FACILITATE A

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:04.173
GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:04.774
GOOD THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.375
ALREADY DOING IN THEIR VINEYARDS

01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:11.981
AND WINERIES.

01:04:12.048 --> 01:04:14.116
SO IT TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:15.985
SUSTAINABILITY PIECE.

01:04:16.052 --> 01:04:18.087
IT COULD TAKE A COUPLE HOURS IF

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:20.022
WE HAD A CONFERENCE LIKE THIS

01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:26.262
YEAH SO SO -- SIDE FAMILY WINES.

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:28.130
WE MARKET AROUND THE WORLD

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:30.333
THERE'S SIXTY BRANDS AND WE SELL

01:04:30.399 --> 01:04:32.368
OVERSEAS AND AND IF IT IS THE

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:32.735
FIRST QUESTION.

01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:36.405
OVER THERE -- SO WE WE HAVE A

01:04:36.472 --> 01:04:38.541
TWO MEGAWATT WIND TURBINE 1100%

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:40.409
POWER BY WHEN WE RECYCLE

01:04:40.476 --> 01:04:44.213
EVERYTHING -- WATER COMPOST OUR

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.315
VINEYARDS ARE ALSO STATED WE

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:46.682
CERTIFIED SO.

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:48.517
I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH A A

01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:50.453
SWEDISH BUYER YESTERDAY THERE'S

01:04:50.519 --> 01:04:50.820
A NEW TENDER.

01:04:50.886 --> 01:04:52.588
FROM SWEDEN WHICH MEANS THAT'S

01:04:52.655 --> 01:04:54.490
HOW THEY PURCHASE THERE ONE

01:04:54.557 --> 01:04:56.192
THREE TENDERS.

01:04:56.259 --> 01:04:58.361
AND THE WINERY NOT ONLY THE

01:04:58.427 --> 01:05:00.229
GRAPES AND TO BE ASSISTING WITH

01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:02.231
CERTIFIED THE WINERIES TO BE

01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:02.832
SUSTAINABLE CERTIFIED SO THE

01:05:02.898 --> 01:05:04.333
WINE INSTITUTE NOW HAS THE

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:04.700
CERTIFICATION.

01:05:04.767 --> 01:05:06.335
ALMOST NO WINERIES HAVE IT YET

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:08.604
SO OURS HAS IT STARTING WITH THE

01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:10.306
EIGHTEEN VANTAGE SO IT'S NOT

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:12.208
JUST THE CONSUMER I MEAN IT IS

01:05:12.275 --> 01:05:12.808
ULTIMATELY BUT IF THE BUYER.

01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:14.777
THE GATE KEEPER THAT'S LOOKING

01:05:14.844 --> 01:05:16.379
FOR SUSTAINABILITY SO YOU ASKED

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:20.149
ABOUT STICKINESS OF OF CUSTOMERS

01:05:20.216 --> 01:05:20.549
AND AUTHENTICITY.

01:05:20.616 --> 01:05:22.685
A ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHANGES IN

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:24.453
THE LAST TEN YEARS AS DIGITAL

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:24.754
MARKETING.

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:28.157
THAT HELPS THE SUSTAINABILITY

01:05:28.224 --> 01:05:30.259
I'M THE THE STICKINESS OF OF

01:05:30.326 --> 01:05:34.230
YOUR CUSTOMERS -- I MEAN YOU

01:05:34.297 --> 01:05:38.267
HAVE TO DO THAT NOW -- OR YOU

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:40.403
WANT ATTRACT CUSTOMERS YOU WON'T

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:42.471
YOU WON'T KEEP THEM IN A CUP AND

01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:43.105
A QUANTITY IN THE I ALSO THINK

01:05:43.172 --> 01:05:44.307
THE QUALITY OF YOUR PRODUCT.

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:46.709
ADS -- TO HOW LONG THEY STAY

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:48.344
WITH YOU YOU MIGHT GET A MENU

01:05:48.411 --> 01:05:48.978
MUCH ALMOST YOUR CHOICE BUT IF

01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:50.379
YOU MAKE A REAL HIGH QUALITY

01:05:50.446 --> 01:05:51.013
PRODUCT AND YOU KEEP THAT UP.

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:54.383
AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:56.185
YOUR CUSTOMERS.

01:05:56.252 --> 01:06:00.189
IF I COULD JUST ORDER SOMETHING.

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:02.258
I THINK -- WHAT WHAT I'VE

01:06:02.325 --> 01:06:02.892
NOTICED IN THE INDUSTRY IS THE

01:06:02.958 --> 01:06:04.560
THERE'S A HUGE INTEREST IN

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:06.195
SUSTAINABILITY?

01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:06.762
WHETHER TOM THE WINERY SIDE

01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:08.331
PEOPLE COMING TO OUR WATER TO

01:06:08.397 --> 01:06:10.533
SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO A THOROUGH

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:12.368
WATER YOU'RE THE VINEYARD -- I

01:06:12.435 --> 01:06:14.470
PROBABLY SHOULD SEE THAT

01:06:14.537 --> 01:06:15.104
INTEREST MORE OFTEN THAN I SEE

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:16.372
IT IN THE MARKETING.

01:06:16.439 --> 01:06:18.307
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:06:18.374 --> 01:06:20.276
THE REMEMBER THAT.

01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:22.578
YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S A FARMING

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:28.284
IT'S NEVER CULTURAL.

01:06:28.351 --> 01:06:28.884
IN THOSE WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE

01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:30.319
THAT I TALK TO ARE SO

01:06:30.386 --> 01:06:32.254
INTERESTING SUSTAINABILITY --

01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:34.423
THEY'RE INTERESTED BECAUSE THEY

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:35.024
WANT THE FORM TO BE THERE FOR

01:06:35.091 --> 01:06:36.692
THE NEXT GENERATION.

01:06:36.759 --> 01:06:38.761
AND THAT'S REALLY THE KEY ISSUE

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:39.395
EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT USING IT FOR

01:06:39.462 --> 01:06:44.700
MARKETING.

01:06:44.767 --> 01:06:46.702

WINE GRAPES PLANTED GROUND BY

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:40.536
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

01:10:40.603 --> 01:10:41.837
GROWERS.

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:44.139
APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THE CROP IS

01:10:44.206 --> 01:10:46.008
PURCHASED BY WINERY BUYERS IN

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:46.575

TWO THIRDS OF THE CROP AND

01:10:52.414 --> 01:10:53.882
ANOTHER THIRD IS MADE UP BY

01:10:53.949 --> 01:10:59.822
DOZENS OF OTHER RIVALS.

01:10:59.888 --> 01:11:00.522
WAKE COUNTY IS PART OF THE NORTH

01:11:00.589 --> 01:11:02.224
COAST AVA AND WITHIN LIKE COUNTY

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:05.794
THERE ARE SEVEN DESIGNATED ABA'S

01:11:05.861 --> 01:11:06.362
INTO MORE CURRENTLY IN THE

01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:09.932
PIPELINE WITH TTB.

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:12.735
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR REGION WE

01:11:12.801 --> 01:11:13.235
TALK ABOUT THE DISTINCT

01:11:13.302 --> 01:11:14.436
COMBINATION OF CLIMATE GEOLOGY

01:11:14.503 --> 01:11:16.639
AND SOILS AND THE IMPACT ON THE

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:20.242
CHARACTER OF THE GRAPES AND ONCE?

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:20.876
THE MOST DISTINGUISHING FEATURE

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:22.411
IS THE ELEVATION THE MAJORITY OF

01:11:22.478 --> 01:11:24.413
VINEYARDS ARE PLANTED ABOUT

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:24.880
FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET.

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:26.548
HIGHER PUTS THREE DYNAMICS INTO

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:30.219
PLAY DRYER SHORTER AND COLDER.

01:11:30.285 --> 01:11:32.087
LAKE COUNTY FRUIT RECEIVES

01:11:32.154 --> 01:11:34.189
EXCELLENT UV EXPOSURE UP 210%

01:11:34.256 --> 01:11:34.790
MORE UV THAN NEIGHBORING C.

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:36.258
LEVEL VALLEYS.

01:11:36.325 --> 01:11:38.360
THAT INCREASED UV TRIGGERS

01:11:38.427 --> 01:11:40.496
THICKER SKINS AND INTENSE WINDS

01:11:40.562 --> 01:11:42.131
WITHIN ALL KLAY RIPE TANNINS.

01:11:42.197 --> 01:11:44.266
WAKE COUNTY HAS POSITIONED

01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:44.867
ITSELF AS A LEADER IN HIGH

01:11:44.933 --> 01:11:46.568
ALTITUDE ONE GREAT PRODUCTION

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:48.437
THE REGION HAS HOSTED.

01:11:48.504 --> 01:11:50.272
INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIA THE

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:54.243
ELEVATION OF ONE PROGRAM.

01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:56.545
AS A HIGH ELEVATION REGIONALLY

01:11:56.612 --> 01:11:57.146
COUNTY HAS A DRIER CLIMATE AND

01:11:57.212 --> 01:11:58.881
CONSISTENTLY MUCH LESS HUMIDITY

01:11:58.947 --> 01:12:01.050
LITTLE TO NO FOG COMPARED TO ITS

01:12:01.116 --> 01:12:02.851
NEIGHBORS IN FACT IT TYPICALLY

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:04.887
HAS ABOUT 50% LESS HUMID.

01:12:04.953 --> 01:12:07.056
HUMIDITY THE NAPA DURING THE

01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:07.456
GROWING SEASON.

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:09.091
DRY CONDITIONS HELP PREVENT ROT

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:11.160
AND THAT ALLOWS GROWERS TO USE

01:12:11.226 --> 01:12:11.727
LESS SULFUR IN THE VINEYARD

01:12:11.794 --> 01:12:13.262
WHICH FACILITATES FOR QUALITY

01:12:13.328 --> 01:12:17.066
AND REDUCES OPERATIONAL COSTS.

01:12:17.132 --> 01:12:19.134
LAKE COUNTY HAS A SHORTER

01:12:19.201 --> 01:12:20.903
GROWING SEASON IN THIS LIMITS

01:12:20.969 --> 01:12:22.971
VEGETATIVE GROWTH THAT CAN

01:12:23.038 --> 01:12:23.505
INCREASE PEST PRESSURE.

01:12:23.572 --> 01:12:25.474
COLDER WINTERS KILL OFF MANY

01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:27.643
OVER WINTERING PASS AND BOTH OF

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:29.211
THESE FACTORS LEAD TO REDUCED

01:12:29.278 --> 01:12:31.480
USE OF PESTICIDES AND HERBICIDES

01:12:31.547 --> 01:12:33.248
IN THE VINEYARD.

01:12:33.315 --> 01:12:35.417
THE REGION EXPERIENCES

01:12:35.484 --> 01:12:37.352
SIGNIFICANT DIE ARE DIURNAL

01:12:37.419 --> 01:12:39.388
SHIFT WITH WARM DAYS AND COOL

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:41.223
NIGHTS AND OFTEN A SWING OF MORE

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:41.857
THAN FIFTY DEGREES IN A TWENTY

01:12:41.924 --> 01:12:43.392
FOUR HOUR PERIOD.

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:45.494
THIS FIXES DEEP COLOR WHILE

01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:47.429
RETAINING NATURAL ACIDITY

01:12:47.496 --> 01:12:51.333
CREATING COMPLEX WINES.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.402
THE WIND FACTOR FROM THE LAKE

01:12:53.469 --> 01:12:54.069
LENDS A MODERATING INFLUENCE AND

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:55.738
ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE CLEAR

01:12:55.804 --> 01:12:57.773
SKIES ALL THESE FACTORS TOGETHER

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:00.075
CONTRIBUTE TO WINDS WITH PURITY

01:13:00.142 --> 01:13:00.342
OF FRUIT.

01:13:00.409 --> 01:13:02.044

GEOLOGICALLY SPEAKING THIS

01:13:08.083 --> 01:13:08.584
GRAPHIC SHOWS MANY OF THE

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:09.885
TECTONIC FORCES AT PLAY

01:13:09.952 --> 01:13:13.922
INCLUDING THE NORTH COAST MAGMA

01:13:13.989 --> 01:13:14.523

THAT A LITTLE BIT ONE OF THEM IS

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:21.729
THE THE WELL FUNDED PROMOTION OF

01:28:21.796 --> 01:28:22.230
WINES BY INTERNATIONAL

01:28:22.296 --> 01:28:24.132

01:28:24.198 --> 01:28:26.067
I CAN TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE.

01:28:26.134 --> 01:28:28.036
THE E. U. ALONE SPENDS OVER ONE

01:28:28.102 --> 01:28:30.038
BILLION DOLLARS IN MARKETING

01:28:30.104 --> 01:28:32.006
PROMOTION AND GRAPES AS THE

01:28:32.073 --> 01:28:34.042
SUBSIDIES EACH YEAR -- SO THAT

01:28:34.108 --> 01:28:35.943
THAT'S A GREAT ASSISTANCE TO

01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:36.544
THAT MARKET OBVIOUSLY THE THE

01:28:36.611 --> 01:28:38.346
TERROR FROM TRADE FRICTIONS THAT

01:28:38.413 --> 01:28:39.947
WE C..

01:28:40.014 --> 01:28:41.916
OUR CHALLENGE TO OUR INDUSTRY --

01:28:41.983 --> 01:28:43.885
BREXIT UNCERTAINTY IS A

01:28:43.951 --> 01:28:44.519
CHALLENGE AND OF COURSE OUR OUR

COMPETITIVE PRICE DISADVANTAGE

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:48.256
EXPRESSLY IN ASIA MARKET NOW IS

01:28:48.322 --> 01:28:50.091
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:52.360
GRAPPLE WITH -- ALL THE TIME AS

01:28:52.427 --> 01:28:52.560
WELL.

01:28:52.627 --> 01:28:54.462
HOWEVER I CAN TELL YOU -- THAT

01:28:54.529 --> 01:28:56.531

01:29:07.141 --> 01:29:10.578
CALIFORNIA I THINK YOU'LL SEE

01:29:10.645 --> 01:29:12.647
SOME FANTASTIC GROWTH IN SOME OF

01:29:12.714 --> 01:29:13.281
THESE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN

01:29:13.347 --> 01:29:15.016
THE NEXT DECADE BECOMES WE'RE

01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:16.918
VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT.

01:29:16.984 --> 01:29:18.820
AND ALSO ON THE DOMESTIC SIDE WE

01:29:18.886 --> 01:29:20.955
ALL KNOW ABOUT MILLENNIALS AND

01:29:21.022 --> 01:29:21.422

PAST YEAR OR SO WAS MAYBE A

01:29:27.762 --> 01:29:29.363
LITTLE OVER ESTIMATED FROM

01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.964
MILLENNIALS WE SEE THE WINE

01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:31.799
INDUSTRY NOW REALLY ENGAGING IN

01:29:31.866 --> 01:29:33.601
FORMATS TO PROMOTE.

01:29:33.668 --> 01:29:35.436
OUR WINDS TO MILLENNIALS IN WAYS

01:29:35.503 --> 01:29:39.474
THAT ARE ATTRACTIVE TO THEM -- I

01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:40.041
THINK FOR EXAMPLE YOU SEE.

01:29:40.108 --> 01:29:41.542
WE ALL KNOW THAT MILLENNIALS ARE

01:29:41.609 --> 01:29:43.411
MORE DIGITALLY FOCUSED SO NOW

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:45.580

IN MORE DIGITAL PLATFORMS TO

01:29:47.548 --> 01:29:49.383
COMMUNICATING WITH MILLENNIALS

01:29:49.450 --> 01:29:51.686
ALSO -- MILLENNIALS LIKE MORE

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:52.286

01:30:00.428 --> 01:30:01.763
THING AS WELL.

01:30:01.829 --> 01:30:03.698
ALSO WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE

01:30:03.765 --> 01:30:05.466
PREVIOUS PANEL THE THE

01:30:05.533 --> 01:30:07.602
IMPORTANCE OF SUSTAINABILITY.

01:30:07.668 --> 01:30:09.637
ORGANIC TO MILLENNIALS AND

01:30:09.704 --> 01:30:11.739

CINEMA COUNTY IF YOU LOOK AT

01:30:16.177 --> 01:30:17.779
WHAT MY COUNTERPARTS OF DONE.

01:30:17.845 --> 01:30:20.047

ABLE TO MARKET.

01:30:33.995 --> 01:30:34.529
AND THEN OF COURSE WE TALKED

01:30:34.595 --> 01:30:36.364
ABOUT WINERIES CREATING VARIOUS

01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:38.266
EXPERIENCES WELL ENGAGING THOSE

01:30:38.332 --> 01:30:40.168
MILLENNIALS IN CREATING THOSE

01:30:40.234 --> 01:30:42.069
EXPERIENCES THAT ARE ATTRACTIVE

01:30:42.136 --> 01:30:44.138
TO THEM ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND

01:30:44.205 --> 01:30:44.705
THEN OF COURSE JUST THE THE

01:30:44.772 --> 01:30:46.240
INCREASING CONVENIENCE --

01:30:46.307 --> 01:30:48.476
MILLENNIALS ARE LACKING WINDS

01:30:48.543 --> 01:30:50.278

WHETHER IT'S BY THE POOL ON THE

01:30:57.251 --> 01:30:57.785
LAKE OR WHOEVER MAYBE SO THE

01:30:57.852 --> 01:30:59.020
WIND INJURE INDUSTRY NOW IS

01:30:59.086 --> 01:31:02.857
ENGAGING I THINK IN A MUCH MORE --

01:31:02.924 --> 01:31:06.994
POSITIVE IN IN PROMOTIONAL WAY

01:31:07.061 --> 01:31:07.595
TO ENGAGE THAT TYPE OF OF OF

01:31:07.662 --> 01:31:11.032
MARKET HERE.

01:31:11.098 --> 01:31:13.434
ALSO WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT I

01:31:13.501 --> 01:31:14.001
DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT A

01:31:14.068 --> 01:31:15.803
COUPLE OF CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE

01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:17.338
SEEING.

01:31:17.405 --> 01:31:19.807
IN OUR MARKETS IN RIGHT JOHNSON

01:31:19.874 --> 01:31:21.909
TOUCHED ON SOME OF THOSE -- NOT

01:31:21.976 --> 01:31:22.476
ONLY ARE WE COMPETING ON A

01:31:22.543 --> 01:31:24.312
GLOBAL SCALE WITH OUR WINDS AND

AS WELL ANOTHER CONCERNS AS RAY

01:31:28.382 --> 01:31:30.017
TALKED ABOUT.

01:31:30.084 --> 01:31:30.651
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

01:31:30.718 --> 01:31:32.353
SEE YOU HERE IN CINEMA COUNTY I

01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:34.288
KNOW OTHER ASSOCIATIONS ARE

01:31:34.355 --> 01:31:36.457
DEALING WITH IT IS THE PROBLEM

01:31:36.524 --> 01:31:38.459
PROBLEMATIC PERMIT PROCESS WE

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:40.494
ALL KNOW THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:31:40.561 --> 01:31:41.162
REGULATIONS AND SO FORTH BUT THE

01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:42.864
PROCESS ITSELF HAS BECOME A REAL

01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:44.799
CHALLENGE THAT OUR ORGANIZATION

01:31:44.866 --> 01:31:45.032
SPENDS.

01:31:45.099 --> 01:31:46.667
QUITE A BIT OF TIME ADDRESSING --

01:31:46.734 --> 01:31:50.471
EVERY WEEK -- I CAN TELL YOU OF

01:31:50.538 --> 01:31:52.707
ONE EXIT RECENT EXAMPLE WE HAD A

01:31:52.773 --> 01:31:54.675
WINERY -- IT WAS AN EXISTING

01:31:54.742 --> 01:31:56.577
WINERY THAT WENT TO BUILD A NEW

01:31:56.644 --> 01:32:00.481
FACILITY -- AND THAT -- PROCESS

01:32:00.548 --> 01:32:02.516
TWO SIX YEARS.

01:32:02.583 --> 01:32:03.050
OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:32:03.117 --> 01:32:06.621
DOLLARS JUST TO GET THE YES.

01:32:06.687 --> 01:32:07.188
INTO THE POINT NOW FOR THAT

01:32:07.255 --> 01:32:08.823
PROJECT WHILE IT IS APPROVED --

01:32:08.890 --> 01:32:11.192
IS DELAYED A YEAR BECAUSE OF THE

01:32:11.259 --> 01:32:13.094
MONEY SPENT ON JUST GETTING THAT

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:15.129
YES SO WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:32:15.196 --> 01:32:16.931
CINEMACON INVENTORS OF WAYS AND

01:32:16.998 --> 01:32:18.900
WE'RE INTO CS TO COAL TO WORK

01:32:18.966 --> 01:32:19.500
WITH OUR COUNTY OFFICIALS AND

01:32:19.567 --> 01:32:21.269
AND OTHERS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

01:32:21.335 --> 01:32:23.304
SURE THAT WE CAN REFINE AND

01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:24.839
REVIEW THAT PROCESS.

01:32:24.906 --> 01:32:26.807
IN TO BRING FOR A PROGRAM THAT

01:32:26.874 --> 01:32:28.910
THAT THAT LIMITS THAT TIME LINE

01:32:28.976 --> 01:32:31.045
AS WELL AS EDUCATE -- POTENTIAL

01:32:31.112 --> 01:32:33.114
APPLICANT ON WHAT THAT MAXIMUM

01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:35.116
COSTS COULD POSSIBLY BE SO THEY

01:32:35.182 --> 01:32:37.051
CAN BUDGET AND AND PLAN ON THAT

01:32:37.118 --> 01:32:37.318
AS WELL.

01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:39.186
AND THEN RAY ALSO TALKED ABOUT

01:32:39.253 --> 01:32:41.322
EARLIER THE IMPORTANCE OF DIRECT

01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:41.656
TO CONSUMER.

01:32:41.722 --> 01:32:43.124
I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THE

01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:44.992
DIRECT CONSUMER IS ALL ABOUT

01:32:45.059 --> 01:32:47.295
SURVIVAL FOR THIS WINE INDUSTRY.

01:32:47.361 --> 01:32:47.929
IT'S NOT ABOUT THROWING PARTIES

01:32:47.995 --> 01:32:49.263
IT'S NOT ABOUT NECESSARILY PAN

01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:51.299
YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS TRULY ABOUT

01:32:51.365 --> 01:32:51.866
SURVIVAL IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:32:51.933 --> 01:32:55.269
AVERAGE FAMILY OWNED WINERY --

01:32:55.336 --> 01:32:57.238
SICK IT'S 61%.

01:32:57.305 --> 01:32:59.273
OF THE REVENUES IS DIRECT TO

01:33:03.711 --> 01:33:05.379
REGARDING DIRECT CONSUMER FOR

01:33:05.446 --> 01:33:07.682

FOR EXAMPLE ON THE WINERY EVENTS

01:33:11.652 --> 01:33:15.656
AND ACTIVITIES SIDE -- I THINK

01:33:15.723 --> 01:33:16.290
IF YOU LOOK AT HOW THE MARKETS

01:33:16.357 --> 01:33:17.959
CHANGE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES

01:33:18.025 --> 01:33:20.027
THE NUMBER OF WHOLESALERS ACROSS

01:33:20.094 --> 01:33:21.696
THE UNITED STATES HAS

01:33:21.762 --> 01:33:23.798
DRAMATICALLY BEEN REDUCED OVER

THE LAST FEW YEARS.

01:33:24.332 --> 01:33:26.033
WHILE THE NUMBER OF WINERIES HAS

01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:27.902
INCREASED SO EVEN IF I WANT --

01:33:27.969 --> 01:33:30.071

BE INTERESTED -- MANY OF OUR

01:37:35.216 --> 01:37:37.017
CHALLENGES STEM FROM THE FACT

YOU KNOW THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR

01:39:14.715 --> 01:39:18.419
US OBVIOUSLY -- THERE'S A

01:39:18.485 --> 01:39:19.086
THERE'S OTHER LITTLE THINGS IN

01:39:19.153 --> 01:39:20.587
THE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION -- YOU

ENDEAVOR TO GET AT THIS BUT IT'S

01:39:28.896 --> 01:39:30.664
LIKE A DEATH FROM A THOUSAND

01:39:30.731 --> 01:39:32.366
CUTS KIND OF APPROACH HERE --

01:39:32.433 --> 01:39:32.900
THEY MAINTAIN AN ABSOLUTE

01:39:32.966 --> 01:39:34.401
MONOPOLY.

01:39:34.468 --> 01:39:36.670
ON THE USE OF GEOGRAPHICAL

01:39:36.737 --> 01:39:38.739
INDICATIONS -- FOR EXAMPLE THAT

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:40.674
YOU CAN USE ON A BOTTLE OF WINE --

01:39:40.741 --> 01:39:42.743
CALIFORNIA -- ONE CAN'T SAY FOR

01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:44.912
EXAMPLE THE WORD CHATEAU ON IT

01:39:44.978 --> 01:39:46.380
IF YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT IN

01:39:46.447 --> 01:39:48.515
EUROPE AND THERE ARE OVER A

01:39:48.582 --> 01:39:49.149
THOUSAND OF THESE TYPE OF OF

01:39:49.216 --> 01:39:50.784
LABELS THAT -- ARE ALL PART OF

01:39:50.851 --> 01:39:52.553
THE RULES.

01:39:52.619 --> 01:39:56.490
IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE.

01:39:56.557 --> 01:39:58.559
TO WAIT WE RESEARCH THE THEY

01:39:58.625 --> 01:40:00.561
CAN'T SAY CLASSIC OR CREAM WHICH

01:40:00.627 --> 01:40:01.228
I CAN'T EVEN RECALL SEEING ON A

01:40:01.295 --> 01:40:04.465
BOTTLE OF WINE BUT ANYWAY BUT

01:40:04.531 --> 01:40:05.099
YOU KNOW IT'S JUST LIKE LITTLE

01:40:05.165 --> 01:40:06.567
THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE THEY

01:40:06.633 --> 01:40:08.702
POSE CHALLENGES -- INTERESTINGLY

01:40:08.769 --> 01:40:10.704
ALSO IN EUROPE -- THEY HAVE A

01:40:10.771 --> 01:40:12.806
LOT OF FOCUS ON THE USE OF CROP

01:40:12.873 --> 01:40:14.808
PROTECTION MATERIALS -- THAT

01:40:14.875 --> 01:40:16.944
THAT -- WE USED TO PROTECT THE

01:40:17.010 --> 01:40:20.481
GRAPES AND HAVE ON SEVERAL

01:40:20.547 --> 01:40:22.750
OCCASIONS -- ASKED WINERIES TO

01:40:22.816 --> 01:40:25.052
TEST THEIR WINES FOR CERTAIN

01:40:25.119 --> 01:40:27.187
CHEMICALS THAT MAY EXIST IN A

01:40:27.254 --> 01:40:29.256
WINE AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE IS

01:40:29.323 --> 01:40:30.958
ALMOST ALWAYS COME BACK MAYBE

01:40:31.024 --> 01:40:31.225
NEGATIVE.

01:40:31.291 --> 01:40:33.160
BUT IT'S A GREAT EXPENSE TO

01:40:33.227 --> 01:40:35.262
ANYONE -- TO HAVE TO DO THIS

01:40:35.329 --> 01:40:37.431
JUST -- TO BILL TO PUT YOURSELF

01:40:37.498 --> 01:40:37.931
IN THE EXPORT MARKET.

01:40:37.998 --> 01:40:39.500
AND JUST HOPE THAT THREAT

01:40:39.566 --> 01:40:41.435
HOVERING OVER THAT THAT WE MAY I

01:40:41.502 --> 01:40:45.406
ASK SOMEBODY TO DO THAT HAS AN

01:40:45.472 --> 01:40:47.408
EFFECTIVE DEPRESSING -- SO -- I

01:40:47.474 --> 01:40:49.343
WENT INTO JUST ONE MORE THING --

01:40:49.410 --> 01:40:51.612
YOU -- LIKELY RIGHT IN THE NEWS

01:40:51.678 --> 01:40:53.647
THIS WHOLE BUSINESS -- ABOUT

01:40:53.714 --> 01:40:57.351
AIRBUS AND THE TRADE ISSUES THAT

01:40:57.418 --> 01:40:57.985
THAT'S CREATING -- BELIEVE OR

01:40:58.051 --> 01:40:59.720
NOT -- CAL CALIFORNIA WINE --

01:40:59.787 --> 01:41:01.722
MAY GET CAUGHT UP IN THAT IS AS

01:41:01.789 --> 01:41:03.424
WELL AND WE COULD -- SEE

01:41:03.490 --> 01:41:05.626
ACTUALLY I EVEN A HIGHER TERROR

01:41:05.692 --> 01:41:07.728
ON OUR PRODUCTS GOING INTO

01:41:07.795 --> 01:41:08.095
EUROPEAN UNION.

01:41:08.162 --> 01:41:09.897
AS YOU KNOW KIND OF THE FRIENDLY

01:41:09.963 --> 01:41:13.267
FIRE FROM -- THAT EXCHANGE --

01:41:13.333 --> 01:41:15.602
YEAH IT'S ONE CAUGHT UP IN IT

01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:17.471
WHICH IS A REAL SHAME -- IN

01:41:17.538 --> 01:41:19.640
CHINA OF YOU KNOW WHAT SPOKE TO

01:41:19.706 --> 01:41:23.477
THE COMMITTEE -- LAST YEAR ABOUT

01:41:23.544 --> 01:41:25.479
THIS ISSUE -- THAT'S GOING FROM

01:41:25.546 --> 01:41:27.548
BAD TO WORSE -- YOU KNOW IT I

01:41:27.614 --> 01:41:29.416
THINK A YEAR AND A HALF AGO --

01:41:29.483 --> 01:41:31.552
THE TERROR OF ON CALIFORNIA ONE

01:41:31.618 --> 01:41:33.353
IN A CHINA WAS LIKE 15% --

01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:35.589
BEGINNING IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR

01:41:35.656 --> 01:41:39.326
WERE AT NINETY THREE SO.

01:41:39.393 --> 01:41:41.562
BUT THE UGLY AND IS THE REAL

01:41:41.628 --> 01:41:43.464
SHAME THERE -- CHINA'S SOMETHING

01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:45.499
LIKE THE IT'S DOWN THE LIST A

01:41:45.566 --> 01:41:47.301
LITTLE BIT AS FAR AS WINE

01:41:47.367 --> 01:41:47.901
EXPORTS FOR CALIFORNIA. FOR

01:41:47.968 --> 01:41:49.903
ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE SEVENTY NINE

01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:51.505
MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED TO LIKE

THE COSTS ARE INCREASING AT 90% --

MORE PRODUCTION ALL THE VENEERS

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:15.408

DEMAND OF THE WORKFORCE.
