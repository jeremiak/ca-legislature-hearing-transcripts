ONLINE SOME STUDENTS MAY NOT BE

00:24:43.648 --> 00:24:45.150
ONLINE- I WOULD ENCOURAGE

00:24:45.217 --> 00:24:46.351
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE

00:24:46.418 --> 00:24:49.120
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BE READY

00:24:49.187 --> 00:24:49.721
TO PROVIDE ONLINE LEARNING A

00:24:49.788 --> 00:24:50.889
CONTINUE THAT APPROACH. BECAUSE

00:24:50.956 --> 00:24:52.591
THEY MAY WELL NEEDED SOME

00:24:52.657 --> 00:24:53.625
SCHOOLS SOME STUDENTS MAY BE

00:24:53.692 --> 00:24:54.826
VERY VULNERABLE ANDNEED TO

00:24:54.893 --> 00:24:56.294
REMAIN ONLINE WHILE OTHERS CAN

00:24:56.361 --> 00:24:58.630
COULD IN IT CAN ATTEND SCHOOL

00:24:58.697 --> 00:24:59.631
EVERY DAY AGAIN WE JUST DON'T

00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:01.733
KNOW. SCHOOLS WILL NEED TO WORK

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.101
WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WE

00:25:03.168 --> 00:25:04.436
KNOW THAT THERE IS A WIDE RANGE

00:25:04.502 --> 00:25:06.504
OF OPINION AMONG PARENTS ABOUT

00:25:06.571 --> 00:25:07.873
WHAT SCHOOL SHOULD LOOK LIKE

00:25:07.939 --> 00:25:10.075
NEXT YEAR. I GOT A CALL FOR ONE

00:25:10.141 --> 00:25:11.643
LAST NIGHT. ONLINE LEARNING

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.311
AGAIN WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE IN

00:25:13.378 --> 00:25:15.380
SOME FORM FOR ALL STUDENTS. BUT

00:25:15.447 --> 00:25:16.915
AGAIN CERTAIN GROUPS STUDENTS

00:25:16.982 --> 00:25:18.049
BROUGHT GONNA HAVE TO GO TO USE

00:25:18.116 --> 00:25:20.719
THE ONLINE. MODEL BECAUSE THEY

00:25:20.785 --> 00:25:21.253
AGAIN HER FROM VULNERABLE

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:23.989
GROUPS MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:25:24.055 --> 00:25:25.323
ARE HEARING FROM SOME PARENTS

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:25.991
THAT THEY DO NOT FEEL

00:25:26.057 --> 00:25:26.625
COMFORTABLE SENDING THEIR

00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:27.859
CHILDREN TO SCHOOL SO AGAIN

00:25:27.926 --> 00:25:29.060
THAT ONLINE LEARNING APPROACH

00:25:29.127 --> 00:25:30.729
MAY BE BEST FOR THEM. SCHOOLS

00:25:30.795 --> 00:25:32.430
WILL NEED YOUR HAIR TO THE NEW

00:25:32.497 --> 00:25:34.132
SAFETY PRECAUTIONS FOR MASS.

00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:35.300
DID TO DISINFECTING TO

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:37.369
TEMPERATURE CHECKS AND

00:25:37.435 --> 00:25:38.536
CRITICALLY THEY WILL HAVE TO

00:25:38.603 --> 00:25:39.771
FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP KIDS

00:25:39.838 --> 00:25:41.473
LEARNING. UNDER ALL OF THE

00:25:41.539 --> 00:25:43.975
CIRCUMSTANCES. AND AGAIN WHAT

00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:45.277
HAPPENS IN VERY NORTHERN

00:25:45.343 --> 00:25:47.412
CALIFORNIA MAY BE VERY

00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:49.114
DIFFERENT WHAT HAPPENS IN

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.316
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. MANY OF

00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:52.884
OUR- ESPECIALLY ALMOST AS

00:25:52.951 --> 00:25:53.785
STUDENTS STRUGGLED WITH

00:25:53.852 --> 00:25:55.153
DISTANCE LEARNING THIS SPRING

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.788
AND WILL ARRIVE AT SCHOOL. WAS

00:25:56.855 --> 00:25:59.090
SIGNIFICANT ACADEMIC DEFICITS.

00:25:59.157 --> 00:26:00.392
IT APPEARS THAT MANY STUDENTS

00:26:00.458 --> 00:26:01.760
WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE WITH AT

00:26:01.826 --> 00:26:02.928
LEAST PARTIAL DISTANCE LEARNING

00:26:02.994 --> 00:26:04.462
NEXT YEAR. AND THEIR FEARS THAT

00:26:04.529 --> 00:26:06.031
THESE STUDENTS. MAY HAVE

00:26:06.097 --> 00:26:08.266
LEARNING DEFICITS DEFICITS THAT

00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:10.302
CONTINUE. THAT COMPOUND. THERE

00:26:10.368 --> 00:26:11.703
ARE MANY ISSUES FOR SCHOOLS TO

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:13.705
GRAPPLE WITH. BUT FUNDAMENTALLY

00:26:13.772 --> 00:26:16.975
OUR QUESTION TODAY IS. HOW CAN

00:26:17.042 --> 00:26:18.977
SCHOOLS KEEP STUDENTS HEALTHY.

00:26:19.044 --> 00:26:20.578

00:26:20.645 --> 00:26:22.514
LEARNING ENGAGE AND SUPPORTED

WHEN OUR SYSTEM IS IN FLUX.

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:25.583
MANY OF OUR FAMILIES ARE IN

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:28.153
CRISIS AND ARE FISCAL OUTLOOK

00:26:28.219 --> 00:26:30.689

00:26:30.755 --> 00:26:31.890
REALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT YES IT

00:26:36.328 --> 00:26:38.563
CONTROLLING OR ALTERING AS MANY

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.432
VARIABLES AS WE CAN. THERE ARE

00:26:40.498 --> 00:26:41.900
MANY QUESTIONS TO EXPLORE TODAY

00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:43.234
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO

00:26:43.301 --> 00:26:45.136

A YEAR STARTED THAN OF US WOULD

00:27:26.511 --> 00:27:27.779

00:27:29.881 --> 00:27:31.716

NEW SCHOOL YEAR. IT IS CLEAR

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.542
CALIFORNIA'S SCHOOLS WILL LOOK

PLANNING AND PRACTICING AND A

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.122
LITTLE PATIENCE. I'M CONFIDENT

00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:12.590
THE ELLIE IS CAN PROVIDE

00:28:12.657 --> 00:28:14.826

BEFORE. THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.334

RECREATE EXACTLY WHAT WE HAD

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.539
BEFORE COVERT NINETEEN. BECAUSE

00:28:27.605 --> 00:28:30.141
WHAT WE HAVE IS NOT PERFECT. IT

00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:30.942

COVERT NINETEEN BUT JUST AS

00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:42.053
CRITICALLY IN THE LONG TERM TO

LEARNING- THROUGH THIS

00:35:46.077 --> 00:35:48.145
PANDEMIC. THIS PANDEMIC IS VERY

00:35:48.212 --> 00:35:50.548
DANGEROUS- IT IS CLICK ALREADY

DISPARITIES. THE GUIDANCE THAT

00:36:12.904 --> 00:36:14.238
WE PROVIDED. PROVIDES THE

00:36:14.305 --> 00:36:16.307
STRONGEST RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT

00:36:16.374 --> 00:36:18.075
HOW TO KEEP OUR STUDENTS AND

00:36:18.142 --> 00:36:21.212

00:36:38.896 --> 00:36:40.965
CONVERSATIONS. WITH MANY OF OUR

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:43.167

00:37:21.539 --> 00:37:23.240
A DEVICE IS A TOOL TO KEEP AN

00:37:23.307 --> 00:37:24.475
EDUCATOR IN THEIR STUDENTS

01:02:07.723 --> 01:02:09.325
THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. I

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:11.727
CONSIDER IT AN HONOR TO SPEAK

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:14.263
WITH YOU TODAY. IN MY THIRTY

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:15.965
FOUR YEARS I EDUCATION I HAVE

01:02:16.032 --> 01:02:18.101
TRULY NEVER EXPERIENCED A MORE

01:02:18.167 --> 01:02:19.702
CHALLENGING TIME FOR OUR

01:02:19.769 --> 01:02:22.271
PROFESSION. IN THE CONTEXT OF A

01:02:22.338 --> 01:02:23.806
GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND WITH THE

01:02:23.873 --> 01:02:25.441
SOCIAL UNREST WE ARE

01:02:25.508 --> 01:02:27.610
EXPERIENCING AS A COUNTRY. WE

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:29.645
HAVE NEVER NEEDED YOU AND STATE

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:31.948
LEVEL LEADERSHIP MORE. THE JOB

01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:33.583
EVERY OPENING SCHOOLS IS

01:02:33.649 --> 01:02:36.252
EXTREMELY CHALLENGING. THE AXE

01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:37.487
THE RE OPENING SCHOOLS TASK

01:02:37.553 --> 01:02:38.888
FORCE DEVELOPED A CALL TO

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:41.090
ACTION FOR CLEAR HEALTH AND

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:42.992
SAFETY PROTOCOLS ESSENTIAL

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:44.961
STANDARDS FOR TEACHING AND

01:02:45.027 --> 01:02:45.495
LEARNING FUNDING AND

01:02:45.561 --> 01:02:48.264
FLEXIBILITY. MY ENTIRE CAREER

01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:50.133
HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON CLOSING

01:02:50.199 --> 01:02:52.535
ACHIEVEMENT OPPORTUNITY GAPS

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:53.636
AND CHAMPIONING EQUITY

01:02:53.703 --> 01:02:55.938
UNCOVERING DIFFERENCES IN THE

01:02:56.005 --> 01:02:57.273
SCHOOL EXPERIENCES OF OUR

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.842
CHILDREN. TODAY I STAND BEFORE

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:02.912
YOU CONSIDERING HOW VERY ALIKE

01:03:02.979 --> 01:03:04.614
SCHOOLS HAVE ACTUALLY BàN. AND

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.282
HOW WORRIED MY COLLEAGUES ARE

01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:07.517
AS THEY DESCRIBE OUR NEW

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:10.052
SITUATION AS BEING IN THE WILD

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:12.121
WILD WEST. WHILE THIS PANEL IS

01:03:12.188 --> 01:03:14.390
FOCUSED ON HEALTH AND SAFETY IT

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:16.192
GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT

01:03:16.259 --> 01:03:18.694
GREATER EROSION TO CONSISTENCY

01:03:18.761 --> 01:03:20.396
OF LEARNING EXPERIENCES WILL

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:21.597
FURTHER EXACERBATE THE

01:03:21.664 --> 01:03:24.100
INEQUITIES THAT HAVE PLAGUED

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:25.768
OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS. WHEN I

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:26.969
FIRST READ THE CALIFORNIA

01:03:27.036 --> 01:03:28.104
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:30.239
INDUSTRY GUIDANCE DOCUMENT AND

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:31.507
STRONGER TOGETHER THE

01:03:31.574 --> 01:03:32.775
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

01:03:32.842 --> 01:03:34.977
EDUCATION GUIDE BOOK I WAS

01:03:35.044 --> 01:03:36.412
RELIEVED THAT THE SPIRIT AND

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:38.080
INTENTIONS OF THESE DOCUMENTS

01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:39.382
WERE A LINE TO WHAT I HAD BEEN

01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:40.983
PLANNING. FOR MY SCHOOLS IN MY

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:43.352
DISTRICTS. I WAS SHOCKED TO

01:03:43.419 --> 01:03:44.987
LEARN THAT WHEN THAT THERE WAS

01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:47.957
A SIGNIFICANT LACK OF ALIGNMENT

01:03:48.024 --> 01:03:48.925
FOR SOME OF MY SUPERINTENDENT

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:51.060
COLLEAGUES. ON THE ONE HAND WE

01:03:51.127 --> 01:03:53.062
HAVE LEADERS WHO BELIEVE IF WE

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:54.697
OPEN UNDER THESE CONDITIONS AT

01:03:54.764 --> 01:03:56.599
ALL WE WILL BE FINANCIALLY

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:58.834
DEVASTATED BY LAWSUITS WHEN WE

01:03:58.901 --> 01:04:00.703
CAN'T POSSIBLY GUARANTEED. THAT

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:01.971
EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS ARE

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:04.207
COMPLETELY SAFE. ON THE OTHER

01:04:04.273 --> 01:04:06.709
HAND SOME LEADERS ARE IMAGINING

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:08.544
OPENING SIMILARLY TO THE WAY WE

01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:11.347
CLOSED IN MARCH. AS AN EXAMPLE

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:12.715
THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:14.750
GUIDANCE SAYS TEACH AND

01:04:14.817 --> 01:04:17.119
REINFORCE USE OF CLOCK FACE

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:19.188
COVERINGS MASTER FACE SHIELDS.

01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:21.524
BUT THE CDC GUIDE BOOK SAYS IF

01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:23.025
AN ALLEY A REQUIRES STUDENTS TO

01:04:23.092 --> 01:04:24.794
WEAR FACE COVERINGS THEN THE

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:26.262
ELLIE A MUST PROVIDE FACE

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:28.130
COVERINGS TO BE USED. ALTHOUGH

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:29.699
I'M NOT ONE OF THEM SOME

01:04:29.765 --> 01:04:31.667
LEADERS HAVE INTERPRETED THAT

01:04:31.734 --> 01:04:32.969
TO MEAN THAT MASKS ARE NOT

01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:35.771
REQUIRED AND NO LONGER PART OF

01:04:35.838 --> 01:04:37.807
PLANNING FOR RE OPENING. IF THE

01:04:37.873 --> 01:04:39.375
INTENT WAS UNIFORMITY OF

01:04:39.442 --> 01:04:41.143
DIRECTION IT IS TURNING OUT TO

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:42.545
BE QUITE VARIED IN ITS

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:45.047
IMPLEMENTATION. WITH SEVENTY

01:04:45.114 --> 01:04:47.216
SIX PAGES OF DIRECTION IN THESE

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:49.518
JUST TO DOCUMENTS YOU CAN

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:50.253
IMAGINE THERE ARE MORE

01:04:50.319 --> 01:04:52.488
QUESTIONS AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:54.624
RECEIVED THE NEXT ANTICIPATED

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:55.558
DIRECTION FROM OUR COUNTY

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:57.593
OFFICE SAYS. ONE OF THE

01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.161
STRONGEST RECOMMENDATIONS FROM

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:01.564
THE OXYTOCIN FORCE WAS FOR

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:03.699
CONSISTENCY AND WE CONTINUE TO

01:05:03.766 --> 01:05:05.334
NEED AND WANT TO BE ABLE TO

01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:07.069
REOPEN SCHOOLS IN THE MOST

01:05:07.136 --> 01:05:10.006
REASONABLY CONSISTENT MANNER.

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:12.208
THE LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY IN

01:05:12.275 --> 01:05:14.477
OPENING SCHOOL IS VERY HIGH I

01:05:14.543 --> 01:05:15.811
MADE A LIST OF NEW ROUTINES

01:05:15.878 --> 01:05:17.847
TEACHERS WILL NEED TO TEACH.

01:05:17.913 --> 01:05:19.715
JUST ARRIVING TO SCHOOL

01:05:19.782 --> 01:05:21.684
INVOLVES LEARNING WHAT TO DO

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.519
ABOUT STOCK HOW TO GET ON A BUS

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:25.087
HOW TO SIT HOW TO GET OFFTHE

01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:26.622
BUS HOW DO ARRIVE ON THE SCHOOL

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:28.090
CAMPUS HOW TO GET YOUR

01:05:28.157 --> 01:05:29.825
TEMPERATURE AS FAST WHERE TO GO

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:31.794
IF YOU'RE ALLOWED ENTRANCE AND

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:32.928
IF NOT. HOW THE HALLWAYS ARE

01:05:32.995 --> 01:05:35.731
DESIGNATED FOR POUNDS OF TRAVEL

01:05:35.798 --> 01:05:38.167
AND MORE. I HAVE THOUGHT OF

01:05:38.234 --> 01:05:39.568
FIFTEEN SEPARATE VIDEOS THAT

01:05:39.635 --> 01:05:40.970
WOULD TAKE A MINIMUM OF TWENTY

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:43.272
MINUTES IN LENGTH. FIVE HOURS

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:45.308
OF CONTENT TO KNOW AND

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:47.543
UNDERSTAND FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:48.644
COMING TO SCHOOL FOR THE FIRST

01:05:48.711 --> 01:05:50.713
TIME AT FIVE YEARS OLD. AND FOR

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.348
UPPER MIDDLE GRADE SCHOOLERS

01:05:52.415 --> 01:05:53.849
WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE TO RE

01:05:53.916 --> 01:05:55.685
LEARN YEARS OF PRACTICE WITH

01:05:55.751 --> 01:05:57.987
THE ROUTINES OF THE PAST. THIS

01:05:58.054 --> 01:06:00.256
FEELS CLOSE TO IMPOSSIBLE

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:02.892
WITHOUT MORE STAFF. EVEN WITH

01:06:02.958 --> 01:06:04.593
THE POTENTIAL ROSIER FINANCIAL

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.329
PICTURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:06:06.395 --> 01:06:08.331
HAS BEEN DISCUSSING I AM

01:06:08.397 --> 01:06:10.099
CONFIDENT THAT I WILL BE MAKING

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:12.101
CUTS TO PERSONNEL IN OUR FUTURE

01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:14.503
BOARD MEETINGS. FURTHER

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:16.339
DISTRICTS MUST SPECIFICALLY AND

01:06:16.405 --> 01:06:18.507
ACCURATELY REASSESS THEIR

01:06:18.574 --> 01:06:19.942
OPENING PLANS BEFORE THEY'RE

01:06:20.009 --> 01:06:22.144
ABLE TO NEGOTIATE THE IMPACTS

01:06:22.211 --> 01:06:24.046
AND EFFECTS OF THOSE PLANS WITH

01:06:24.113 --> 01:06:25.581
THEIR LABOR PARTNERS. GREATER

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:27.049
DIRECTION FROM THE STATE MAKES

01:06:27.116 --> 01:06:29.618
THAT EASIER. WE HAVE VERY

01:06:29.685 --> 01:06:30.786
LITTLE TIME AND IT IS

01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:32.655
IMPERATIVE THAT THE WORK OF

01:06:32.722 --> 01:06:35.191
ADULTS DOES NOT COMPROMISE A

01:06:35.257 --> 01:06:37.760
SINGLE DAY OF HIGH QUALITY

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.095
INSTRUCTION FOR A CHILD. LAST

01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:40.730
THE GUIDANCE FROM MULTIPLE

01:06:40.796 --> 01:06:42.298
AGENCIES THAT IS SOMETIMES

01:06:42.365 --> 01:06:44.734
CONTRADICTORY HAS NOT SOFTENED

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:45.768
THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:48.371
RESPONSIBILITY I FEEL TO BE THE

01:06:48.437 --> 01:06:50.506
FINAL AUTHORITY RELATED TO

01:06:50.573 --> 01:06:52.341
MATTERS ASSOCIATED WITH THREE

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:54.377
OPENING MY SCHOOLS. QUESTIONS

01:06:54.443 --> 01:06:55.978
ABOUT THE AUTHORITY OF WHO

01:06:56.045 --> 01:06:57.480
SHOULD BE MAKING THE CALL O

01:06:57.546 --> 01:06:59.215
CLOSING AND REOPENING SCHOOLS

01:06:59.281 --> 01:07:01.684
HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THE FIELD

01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:02.485
AND WE CONTINUE TO SEEK

01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:04.420
GUIDANCE. I WOULD LIKE TO

01:07:04.487 --> 01:07:05.254
ACKNOWLEDGE STATE

01:07:13.662 --> 01:07:18.601

WE MAY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ON

01:07:32.615 --> 01:07:33.983

DISTANCING. THE PAST FEW MONTHS

01:08:00.609 --> 01:08:01.811
HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR

01:08:01.877 --> 01:08:03.712
EVERYONE ESPECIALLY FOR OUR

01:08:03.779 --> 01:08:05.181
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:06.582
CALIFORNIA STATE PDAS BEEN

IN SUCH A LARGE DIVERSE STATE

01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:13.255
YOU MIGHT IMAGINE WE'RE NOT

01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:15.391
GETTING SINGLE ANSWERS BUT

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:16.559
THERE ARE A FEW UNIVERSAL

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:18.160
THEMES THAT KEEP EMERGING THEY

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:20.095
SEEM TO FALL INTO THREE MAIN

01:08:20.162 --> 01:08:22.264

SCHOOL PLANS TO DO AND WHAT

01:08:33.175 --> 01:08:35.077

ALSO LIKE TO BE PART OF THE

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:38.781

KNOW I DON'T WORK IN THE RISK

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:01.455

01:31:06.861 --> 01:31:09.463
GUIDANCE SPEAKS TO THE MOST.

01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:12.733
SAFE WAYS. THAT WE CAN SUPPORT

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:13.868
OUR STUDENTS RETURNED TO

THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. WILL

01:31:18.172 --> 01:31:19.841
CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT AND AS

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:21.876

CONVERSATION TO LOOK AT.

01:31:27.548 --> 01:31:28.316
QUESTIONS AROUND A RISK

01:31:28.382 --> 01:31:30.885
MANAGEMENT. AND I'D BE HAPPY TO

INTERESTED IN JOINING THOSE

01:31:34.655 --> 01:31:36.624
CONVERSATIONS. THERE ARE OTHER

01:31:36.691 --> 01:31:38.092
AGENCIES THAT THE STATE OF

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:39.827

WE WANT TO ENGAGE THEM WILL BE

01:31:44.232 --> 01:31:45.132
CONVENING THEM. IN

01:31:45.199 --> 01:31:47.435
CONVERSATION. BECAUSE I THINK

01:31:47.501 --> 01:31:48.069
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WARRANTS A

01:31:48.135 --> 01:31:50.338
QUESTION. BUT WE UNDERSTAND

01:31:50.404 --> 01:31:51.939
THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE FEARS

01:31:52.006 --> 01:31:54.709
WHEN THE WHEN THE US DEPARTMENT

01:31:54.775 --> 01:31:55.376
OF EDUCATION SAID THAT WE COULD

01:31:55.443 --> 01:31:58.512
PROVIDE. AS A NATION DISTANCE

01:31:58.579 --> 01:32:00.381
LEARNING TO STUDENTS WITH

01:32:00.448 --> 01:32:00.982
DISABILITIES. THERE ARE MANY

01:32:01.048 --> 01:32:03.384
PEOPLE WHO HAVE QUESTIONS.

01:32:03.451 --> 01:32:05.186
QUESTIONS ABOUT LIABILITY SO

01:32:05.253 --> 01:32:06.387
MUCH SO THAT SOME OF THAT.

01:32:06.454 --> 01:32:10.324
VISION TO DO IT. DIRECT WOULD

01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:12.793
NOT ADVISE THAT. STUDENTS WITH

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:14.862
DISABILITIES AND WE WOULD SAY

01:32:14.929 --> 01:32:15.997
THAT THAT IS NOT THE DIRECTION

01:32:16.063 --> 01:32:18.132
TO GO WE THINK IT'S BETTER TO

01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:20.301
ASK THE QUESTIONS TO FACE THEM

01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:21.936
HEAD ON TOGETHER BUT TO PROVIDE

01:32:22.003 --> 01:32:23.504

KNOW WHILE WE'RE- ALL

01:32:55.436 --> 01:32:56.837
TENTATIVELY EXCITED THAT THE

01:32:56.904 --> 01:32:58.706
LEGISLATURE WAS ABLE TO PASS A

01:32:58.773 --> 01:33:00.741
BUDGET THAT DID NOT HAVE-

01:33:00.808 --> 01:33:02.910
EXTREME CUTS. TO EDUCATION WE

01:33:02.977 --> 01:33:04.378
ALL KNOW THAT EDUCATION HAS NOT

01:33:04.445 --> 01:33:05.980
BEEN FULLY RESTORED TO WHERE WE

01:33:06.047 --> 01:33:08.149
SHOULD HAVE BEEN- PRE RECESSION

01:33:08.215 --> 01:33:09.483
IN THE CUTS WE ALSO STAND FOR

01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:11.652
THOSE NUMBER OF YEARS SO WE-

01:33:11.719 --> 01:33:13.421
ALREADY WERE STILL OPERATING AT

01:33:13.487 --> 01:33:15.523
A DEFICIT AND STILL ONE OF THE-

01:33:15.589 --> 01:33:17.491
LOWEST. OF PER PUPIL FUNDED

01:33:17.558 --> 01:33:20.061
STATES IN THE UNITED STATES.

01:33:20.127 --> 01:33:21.996
THAT HAS NOT GONE AWAY NOW WE

01:33:22.063 --> 01:33:23.998
JUST FACES GREATER CHALLENGE.

01:33:24.065 --> 01:33:27.101

01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:31.072
THERE BEEN MODELS DEVELOPED ON

01:33:31.138 --> 01:33:32.974
WHAT AN ADDITION WELL

INVESTMENT TAKE TO ADEQUATELY

01:33:34.508 --> 01:33:35.943
MEET. THE CHALLENGES IN THE

01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:37.111
GUIDELINES THAT ARE BEING

01:33:37.178 --> 01:33:39.480
PLACED IN FRONT OF. BJ'S NOW

01:33:39.547 --> 01:33:41.382

01:33:41.449 --> 01:33:43.551
MUCH A DISH. CLASSIFIED STAFF

01:33:43.617 --> 01:33:45.553
YOU WOULD NEED- SUPPORT FOR THE

01:33:45.619 --> 01:33:47.989
CLEANING AND FOR THE MOVEMENT

01:33:48.055 --> 01:33:49.190
OF CHILDREN IN AND OUT OF THESE

01:33:49.256 --> 01:33:54.362
ADOPTED LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS.

01:33:54.428 --> 01:33:55.496
WELL I CAN SPEAK FOR MY SCHOOL

01:33:55.563 --> 01:33:57.298
DISTRICT IN PARTICULAR IN GREAT

01:33:57.365 --> 01:34:00.534
DETAIL- WE RUN ABOUT A SEVENTY

01:34:00.601 --> 01:34:02.470
FIVE MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET AND

01:34:02.536 --> 01:34:04.605
WE HAVE BEEN DEFICIT SPENDING

01:34:04.672 --> 01:34:06.874
ACROSS YEARS. AND SUFFERING

01:34:06.941 --> 01:34:08.509
FROM DECLINING ENROLMENT SO

01:34:08.576 --> 01:34:09.910
WHAT MAKES THAT INCREDIBLY

01:34:09.977 --> 01:34:12.613
CHALLENGING. IS THAT THERE IS A

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:14.749
THERE'S OFTEN A SENSE IN A

01:34:14.815 --> 01:34:17.084
BROADER RANGE OF CIRCLES. THAT

01:34:17.151 --> 01:34:18.719
SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN

01:34:18.786 --> 01:34:21.288
RESTORED AND WELL FUNDED- BUT

01:34:21.355 --> 01:34:23.290
WHAT IT ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE IN

01:34:23.357 --> 01:34:25.526
MY ENVIRONMENT IS THAT I HAVE.

01:34:25.593 --> 01:34:27.661
BEEN REALLY SUFFERING JUST TO

01:34:27.728 --> 01:34:29.930
KEEP UP- EVERY YEAR WE'VE BEEN

01:34:29.997 --> 01:34:32.433
DEFICIT SPENDING AND REDUCING

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:33.367
OUR ENDING FUND BALANCE

01:34:33.434 --> 01:34:36.003
ANNUALLY- SO THE CHALLENGES I

01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:37.738
FACE AS A RESULT OF HAVING

01:34:37.805 --> 01:34:40.608
FEWER STUDENTS- AND RIGHT

01:34:40.674 --> 01:34:42.309
SIZING THE BUDGET EVERY YEAR-

01:34:42.376 --> 01:34:44.545
COMBINED. WITH RISING COSTS IN

01:34:44.612 --> 01:34:46.047
SPECIAL EDUCATION AND RISING

01:34:46.113 --> 01:34:48.382
COSTS IN PERSON STIRS FUNDING

01:34:48.449 --> 01:34:50.084
THAT WE HAVE TO DO IT FEELS

01:34:50.151 --> 01:34:51.852
THAT WE HAVE JUST BARELY BEEN

01:34:51.919 --> 01:34:54.288
ABLE TO TREAD WATER. AND IN MY

01:34:54.355 --> 01:34:57.024
CASE WE HAVE- MOVED FROM

01:34:57.091 --> 01:34:59.226
POSITIVE TO A QUALIFIED BUDGET

01:34:59.293 --> 01:35:01.462
WHICH IS VERY CONCERNING. AND

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:03.197
THAT WAS BEFORE THIS PARTICULAR

01:35:03.264 --> 01:35:07.468

01:42:40.621 --> 01:42:41.588
LEARNING SUPPORTER BY

01:42:41.655 --> 01:42:43.657
TECHNOLOGY IN THE RIGHT WAYS.

01:42:43.724 --> 01:42:45.025
IT'S CLEAR THAT TECHNOLOGY

01:42:45.092 --> 01:42:46.326
SUPPORTED LEARNING WILL BE PART

01:42:46.393 --> 01:42:48.161
OF OUR EDUCATIONAL FUTURE AND

01:42:48.228 --> 01:42:49.530
THAT ALL CHILDREN MUST BE

01:42:49.596 --> 01:42:51.398
PROVIDED WITH ACCESS. AFTER

01:42:51.465 --> 01:42:52.533
SCHOOLS RE OPEN THEY WILL

01:42:52.599 --> 01:42:54.067
LIKELY CLOSE AGAIN FOR PERIODS

01:42:54.134 --> 01:42:56.570
OF TIME NEXT YEAR ONE INFECTION

01:42:56.637 --> 01:42:58.672
RATES FULLER. SOME SCHOOLS MAY

01:42:58.739 --> 01:43:00.407
REOPEN WITH SCHEDULES THE BLIND

01:43:00.474 --> 01:43:02.042
DISTANCE LEARNING WAS SOCIAL

01:43:02.109 --> 01:43:04.144
DISTANCING ONSITE. SOMETIMES

01:43:04.211 --> 01:43:05.612
FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS OF

01:43:05.679 --> 01:43:07.414
CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:43:07.481 --> 01:43:08.415
YOUNGER CHILDREN MAY BE IN

01:43:08.482 --> 01:43:11.418
SCHOOL FULL TIME OLDER ONES ARE

01:43:11.485 --> 01:43:12.986
STILL LEARNING HOME. ANY

01:43:13.053 --> 01:43:14.955
INTEREST ON. TIMES FOR THE SAY

01:43:15.022 --> 01:43:17.291
GROUPS OF CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE

01:43:17.357 --> 01:43:18.859
IN SCHOOL LEARNING ON MONDAYS

01:43:18.926 --> 01:43:20.661
AND WEDNESDAYS WITH DISTANCE

01:43:20.727 --> 01:43:21.628
LEARNING ON TUESDAYS AND

01:43:21.695 --> 01:43:23.664
THURSDAYS EVEN ONE SCHOOLS

01:43:23.730 --> 01:43:24.965
REOPENED CHILDREN WILL NEED TO

01:43:25.032 --> 01:43:26.667
STAY HOME IF THEY ARE OTHERS

01:43:26.733 --> 01:43:27.834
THEIR HOUSEHOLD HAVE BEEN

01:43:27.901 --> 01:43:29.937
EXPOSED TO THE VIRUS SO THEY'LL

01:43:30.003 --> 01:43:31.538
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PLUG INTO

01:43:31.605 --> 01:43:33.273
JUSTIN'S FLOORING AT ANY TIME

01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:35.042
AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT

01:43:35.108 --> 01:43:37.010
POINT I'VE DONE STUDIES

01:43:37.077 --> 01:43:38.679
INTERNATIONALLY OF RE OPENING

01:43:38.745 --> 01:43:40.547
SCHOOLS AROUND THE WORLD AND

01:43:40.614 --> 01:43:41.748
IT'S CLEAR THAT THE TESTING

01:43:41.815 --> 01:43:44.017
TRACKING AND QUARANTINING. IS

01:43:44.084 --> 01:43:46.853
EQUALLY IMPORTANT AS THE JUSTIN

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:50.490
SAYING AND USE OF MASKS- IN ONE

01:43:50.557 --> 01:43:51.825
EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE

01:43:51.892 --> 01:43:54.661
EXPERIENCE IN FRANCE RECENTLY

01:43:54.728 --> 01:43:56.396
WHERE THEY- USE ALL OF THE

01:43:56.463 --> 01:43:58.131
SOCIAL DISTANCING AND ALL THE

01:43:58.198 --> 01:43:59.533
REST OF IT BUT WITHIN A FEW

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:01.068
DAYS OF OPENING SCHOOL THEY HAD

01:44:01.134 --> 01:44:02.869
TO CLOSE SCHOOLS AGAIN. BECAUSE

01:44:02.936 --> 01:44:04.037
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ADEQUATE

01:44:04.104 --> 01:44:04.938
TESTING TRACKING AND

01:44:05.005 --> 01:44:07.774
QUARANTINING IN PLACE AND THEY

01:44:07.841 --> 01:44:09.676
HAD SEVENTY CASES POP UP WITHIN

01:44:09.743 --> 01:44:11.945
A FEW DAYS. THIS MEANS THAT

01:44:12.012 --> 01:44:13.180
EACH DISTRICT SHOULD HAVE AN

01:44:13.246 --> 01:44:14.881
INSTRUCTIONAL CONTINUITY PLAN

01:44:14.948 --> 01:44:16.984
FOR SEAMLESS CUT NEW CONTINUITY

01:44:17.050 --> 01:44:17.951
OF THE CURRICULUM AND

01:44:18.018 --> 01:44:19.286
INSTRUCTION WHEREVER STUDENTS

01:44:19.353 --> 01:44:21.688
ARE LOCATED. INCLUDING PLANS

01:44:21.755 --> 01:44:22.623
FOR HOW ENGLISH LEARNERS AND

01:44:22.689 --> 01:44:24.157
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WELL

01:44:24.224 --> 01:44:26.259
ACCESS LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES.

01:44:26.326 --> 01:44:27.828
THE NUMBER OF COUNTY OFFICES

01:44:27.894 --> 01:44:28.729
AND DISTRICTS OF ALREADY DONE

01:44:28.795 --> 01:44:31.965
THE SECOND AS MODELS FOR UP.

01:44:32.032 --> 01:44:32.466
SHOULD BE A NEXT. OF THE

01:44:32.532 --> 01:44:33.600
FEDERAL FUNDS THAT ARE

01:44:33.667 --> 01:44:35.902
ALLOCATED FOR LEARNING LOS IF

01:44:35.969 --> 01:44:37.170
WE ARE TO AVOID FURTHER

01:44:37.237 --> 01:44:39.239
EXACERBATING DISRUPTIONS. THE

01:44:39.306 --> 01:44:40.707
ONLY TO THOSE POTENTIAL LOSSES

01:44:40.774 --> 01:44:42.709
OF LEARNING TIME. THERE ARE

01:44:42.776 --> 01:44:44.378
MANY STRONG CURRICULAR MODELS

01:44:44.444 --> 01:44:45.746
INCLUDING STRATEGIES FOR

01:44:45.812 --> 01:44:47.147
SERVING ENGLISH LEARNERS AND

01:44:47.214 --> 01:44:48.649
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES.

01:44:48.715 --> 01:44:49.983
DEVELOPED BY DISTRICTS AND

01:44:50.050 --> 01:44:51.118
COUNTY OFFICES THAT WE WILL

01:44:51.184 --> 01:44:52.853
CERTAINLY MAKE AVAILABLE. IN

01:44:52.919 --> 01:44:54.521
GUIDANCE AND TOOL KITS FOR

01:44:54.588 --> 01:44:56.390
DISTANCE AND WANTED LEARNING.

01:44:56.456 --> 01:44:57.691
THE REALITIES OF THESE COMING

01:44:57.758 --> 01:44:58.992
MONTHS ALSO MEAN WE MUST CLOSE

01:44:59.059 --> 01:45:01.795
THE DIGITAL DIVIDE- AS A

01:45:01.862 --> 01:45:03.897
SUPERINTENDENT THURMOND NOTED.

01:45:03.964 --> 01:45:05.332
THERE WERE MORE THAN A MILLION

01:45:05.399 --> 01:45:07.534
STUDENTS ON ACTIVE WHEN THE

01:45:07.601 --> 01:45:09.870
PANDEMIC BEGAN WE'VE CLOSE THIS

01:45:09.936 --> 01:45:13.140
DIVIDE. BY MORE THAN HAPPY. BUT

01:45:13.206 --> 01:45:14.641
AT LEAST HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:45:14.708 --> 01:45:16.176
STUDENTS ARE STILL ON. BUT IT

01:45:16.243 --> 01:45:18.545
WOULD COST HELP US THAN 10% OF

01:45:18.612 --> 01:45:19.946
THE MONEY WE EXPECT TO ALLOCATE

01:45:20.013 --> 01:45:21.782
TO SCHOOLS. FROM THE FEDERAL

01:45:21.848 --> 01:45:24.217
ANSWERS FUNDS AND IN MY VIEW IT

01:45:24.284 --> 01:45:26.186
SHOULD BE AN ABSOLUTE PRIORITY

01:45:26.253 --> 01:45:28.221
IN OUR FIRST USE OF THE FUNDS.

01:45:28.288 --> 01:45:30.490
THE TECHNOLOGY TOLD ME TO BE IS

01:45:30.557 --> 01:45:32.225
NOT TO REPLACE TEACHERS BUT TO

01:45:32.292 --> 01:45:36.063
ENABLE. HIS FACE TO FACE LIVE

01:45:36.129 --> 01:45:36.663
CONNECTIONS WHICH GIVES AND-

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:38.765
WHEN NOT CLASSROOM TOGETHER. AS

01:45:38.832 --> 01:45:40.300
WELL AS TO PROVIDE STUDENTS

01:45:40.367 --> 01:45:42.602
NECESSARY TOOLS FOR LEARNING-

01:45:42.669 --> 01:45:44.371
AND TO PROVIDE FAMILIES THE

01:45:44.438 --> 01:45:46.006
TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS TELL

01:45:46.073 --> 01:45:47.808

01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:52.112
ABOUT IT THE DISPARATE HEALTH

01:45:52.179 --> 01:45:53.480

COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. ARE

01:45:57.417 --> 01:45:59.386
DEEPLY EXACERBATED BY OUR

01:45:59.453 --> 01:46:00.787
FAILURE TO TAKE CARE OF THE

01:46:00.854 --> 01:46:03.123
DIGITAL DIVIDE WHICH SHIP IN A

01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:05.058
RADIC HATED YEARS AGO AND MUST

01:46:05.125 --> 01:46:07.494
BE ERADICATED NOW. THE SAME AS

01:46:07.561 --> 01:46:14.701
FACED TO FACE INTERACTIONS. TO

ESTABLISH HUMAN CONTACT TO

ALLOW CHILDREN TO BE A

01:46:17.904 --> 01:46:19.272
DISCUSSION WITH THEIR TEACHERS

01:46:19.339 --> 01:46:21.408
AND PEERS. TO PROVIDE A TRUE

FOR UNDERSTANDING AND SEEING

01:46:25.746 --> 01:46:27.514
HOW CHILDREN ARE THINKING AND

01:46:27.581 --> 01:46:29.249
WHAT THEY UNDERSTAND. WHEN THIS

01:46:29.316 --> 01:46:30.884
IS LEARNING IS NECESSARY THEY

01:46:30.951 --> 01:46:34.588
SHOULD BE A DAILY EXPECTATIONS.

A MAJOR FORM OF LEARNING SO I'M

FOR MISSING MOST OF THE

02:15:39.865 --> 02:15:41.099
PRESENTATION AS ONE OF THE

02:15:41.166 --> 02:15:42.667
FOLLOW UP ON THIS QUESTION THAT

02:15:42.734 --> 02:15:44.536
CENTER LEYVA APPS BUT MAYBE THE

02:15:44.603 --> 02:15:47.339
OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN BUDGET.

02:15:47.405 --> 02:15:49.241
OUR BUDGET- FOR LINDA DARLING

02:15:49.307 --> 02:15:51.543
HAMMOND WAS ESSENTIALLY THE ONE

02:15:51.610 --> 02:15:52.777
THAT WE ANNOUNCE TEN DAYS AGO

02:15:52.844 --> 02:15:55.614
WHICH BASICALLY- WOULD REJECT

02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:57.449
THE CUTS TO L. CFF IN OUR

02:15:57.516 --> 02:15:59.317
SCHOOLS AND BASICALLY FULLY

02:15:59.384 --> 02:16:01.119
FUND OUR SCHOOLS WITH THE ONE

02:16:01.186 --> 02:16:02.320
TIME MONEY. THAT WE GET THE

02:16:02.387 --> 02:16:05.156
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- GRANTED WE

02:16:05.223 --> 02:16:07.125
DO WE HAVE THAT THAT INITIAL

02:16:07.192 --> 02:16:08.393
WOULD DEFERRALS FOR THE NEXT

02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:10.896
YEAR BUT FOR THIS YEAR. ROUGHLY

02:16:10.962 --> 02:16:12.397
KEEP SCHOOL FUNDING WHOLE. SO

02:16:12.464 --> 02:16:15.267
REALLY THE QUESTION IS YOU YOU

02:16:15.333 --> 02:16:15.901
SAW WAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S NEWLY

02:16:15.967 --> 02:16:16.535
REVISE I KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT

02:16:16.601 --> 02:16:17.636
DECISION FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU

02:16:17.702 --> 02:16:19.104
ARE. KIND OF THE GOVERNOR'S

02:16:19.170 --> 02:16:20.539
TEAM AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

02:16:20.605 --> 02:16:23.141
HAS A DIFFERENT JOB. BUT DO YOU

02:16:23.208 --> 02:16:25.310
HONESTLY THINK THAT IF WE HAD

02:16:25.377 --> 02:16:26.244
TO ACCEPT WHAT'S IN THE

02:16:26.311 --> 02:16:27.646
GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE WHAT'S MY

02:16:27.712 --> 02:16:29.281
ARE SITTING THERE STILL PUSHING

02:16:29.347 --> 02:16:31.616
THEIR NEGOTIATIONS TODAY. WHICH

02:16:31.683 --> 02:16:32.183
IF WE DON'T GET THE FEDERAL

02:16:32.250 --> 02:16:34.152
FUNDS WOULD HAVE THESE. HUGE

02:16:34.219 --> 02:16:36.054
CUTS TO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT

02:16:36.121 --> 02:16:38.456
THEY COULD DO. ALL WHICH WE

02:16:38.523 --> 02:16:39.858
SPENT THE LAST TWO HOURS

02:16:39.925 --> 02:16:41.493
TALKING ABOUT HE SENSUALLY.

02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:42.227
SCHOOLS ARE GONNA BE DOING

02:16:42.294 --> 02:16:44.262
MORE. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE

02:16:44.329 --> 02:16:45.797
DOING LAST WHAT THEY'VE DONE

02:16:45.864 --> 02:16:49.634
BEFORE. WITH DISTANCE LEARNING

02:16:49.701 --> 02:16:51.036
WHAT SEPARATION ALL THIS PAST

02:16:51.102 --> 02:16:52.604
WE'RE ASKING OUR- BY. A

02:16:52.671 --> 02:16:55.173
TEACHERS TO DO. TO DO REALLY.

02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:57.275
REALITY IF WE HAD TWO X. WHAT

02:16:57.342 --> 02:16:59.544
WAS THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE.

02:16:59.611 --> 02:17:02.280
THAT ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ONE

02:17:02.347 --> 02:17:02.781
THOUSAND OF THEM ACROSS

02:17:02.847 --> 02:17:04.382
CALIFORNIA. COULD PULL IT OFF

02:17:04.449 --> 02:17:05.850
AND ACHIEVE WHAT. THE

02:17:05.917 --> 02:17:08.253
SUPERINTENDENT IN YOU OUTLINED

02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:13.124
WITH NEEDED TO BE DONE. FOR OUR

02:17:13.191 --> 02:17:14.926
KIDS THIS COMING YEAR. WELL I

02:17:14.993 --> 02:17:16.494
THINK EVERYBODY IS VERY ARE

02:17:16.561 --> 02:17:18.463
PUSHING VERY HARD FOR THE

02:17:18.530 --> 02:17:20.231
ADDITIONAL FEDERAL RESOURCES

02:17:20.298 --> 02:17:21.666
THAT NEED TO BE THERE AS I

02:17:21.733 --> 02:17:23.034
UNDERSTOOD THE MAY REVISE IT

02:17:23.101 --> 02:17:25.103
TRIGGERED BACK IN. AS SOON AS

02:17:25.170 --> 02:17:26.671
THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS ARRIVED

02:17:26.738 --> 02:17:30.909
THE- ADDITIONAL- FUNDS NEEDED

02:17:30.976 --> 02:17:33.278
TO KEEP US WHOLE- I KNOW THE

02:17:33.345 --> 02:17:34.112
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS WORKING

02:17:34.179 --> 02:17:36.047
HARD WITH FOLKS IN WASHINGTON

02:17:36.114 --> 02:17:38.149
TO GET THAT- ADDITIONAL MONEY

02:17:38.216 --> 02:17:40.619
ALLOCATED. BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT

02:17:40.685 --> 02:17:43.755
EVEN WHEN THAT HAPPENS- THERE

02:17:43.822 --> 02:17:45.824
ARE GOING TO BE ONGOING

02:17:45.890 --> 02:17:48.326
CHALLENGES OF SCHOOLS. SO WE'RE

02:17:48.393 --> 02:17:50.261
GOING TO BE NEEDING TO PLAN FOR

02:17:50.328 --> 02:17:52.964
RECOVERY ACTS- YOU KNOW.

02:17:53.031 --> 02:17:56.501
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR- THIS IS A

02:17:56.568 --> 02:18:00.271
BIGGER- HITS TO. A STATE

02:18:00.338 --> 02:18:02.574
REVENUES THEN THE GREAT

02:18:02.641 --> 02:18:06.711
RECESSION WAS- IT'S- A TERRIBLE

02:18:06.778 --> 02:18:07.779
SITUATION TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

02:18:07.846 --> 02:18:12.083
BE. FISCALLY SOLVENT AND TO

02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:13.251
START SCHOOL PLEASE DAYS. IT'S

02:18:13.318 --> 02:18:14.653
ONE OF THE REASONS I THINK

02:18:14.719 --> 02:18:16.454
THAT. UP YEAH DISTRICTS ARE

02:18:16.521 --> 02:18:18.523
GOING TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS

02:18:18.590 --> 02:18:22.427
ABOUT WHETHER TO BE- IT SINCE.

02:18:22.494 --> 02:18:25.263
THERE'S GOING TO BE IN IN PLACE

02:18:25.330 --> 02:18:29.401
IN BROKEN MORTAR. CLASS AND I

02:18:29.467 --> 02:18:30.669
AM WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT

02:18:30.735 --> 02:18:31.503
WE- ORGANIZE BOTH THE DID YOU

02:18:31.569 --> 02:18:33.405
RESEARCH FOR EVERY SINGLE

02:18:33.471 --> 02:18:35.306
FEATURING KID. AND WHY WE NEED

02:18:35.373 --> 02:18:37.308
TO ORGANIZE THE- SCHOOL

02:18:37.375 --> 02:18:39.144
RESOURCES IN THE SENSE OF

02:18:39.210 --> 02:18:40.378
INTEGRATED STUDENT SUPPORTS

02:18:40.445 --> 02:18:41.813
THAT ARE GOING TO BE NEEDED.

02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:43.114
IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER WE'RE

02:18:43.181 --> 02:18:45.183
IN R OUT OF BRICK AND MORTAR

02:18:45.250 --> 02:18:46.951
AT VARIOUS POINTS IN THE YEAR.

02:18:47.018 --> 02:18:48.119
BUT I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO

02:18:48.186 --> 02:18:49.521
GET IS TO THE BUDGET QUESTION

02:18:49.587 --> 02:18:52.290
THAT THAT THE CENTER ASKED TO

02:18:52.357 --> 02:18:53.591
IS IT IF WE DON'T GET THE

02:18:53.658 --> 02:18:55.260
FEDERAL FUNDS. THE GOVERNOR'S

02:18:55.326 --> 02:18:56.828
BUDGET WOULD HAVE THESE

02:18:56.895 --> 02:18:58.997
AUTOMATIC CUTS AND WE WOULD.

02:18:59.064 --> 02:19:00.298
FIND SCHOOLS AND HAVE TO GO AND

02:19:00.365 --> 02:19:01.566
GO THROUGH A DEFERRAL SO

02:19:01.633 --> 02:19:03.001
ESSENTIALLY SCHOOLS WOULD GET

02:19:03.068 --> 02:19:05.170
FUNDED. IF WE DIDN'T GET THE

02:19:05.236 --> 02:19:07.639
FEDERAL FUNDS DO YOU THINK THAT

02:19:07.706 --> 02:19:10.508
THE SCHOOL COULD PULL IT OFF

IT. AND I THINK THE FACT OF THE

02:20:56.915 --> 02:20:57.982

THIS KIND OF CREATIVITY AND

COMMITMENT THAT I DON'T HAVE

02:25:07.765 --> 02:25:09.967
TIME TO GO INTO TODAY. BUT ONE

02:25:10.034 --> 02:25:11.135
THING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

02:25:11.202 --> 02:25:12.804
TO EMPHASIZE ABOUT THESE

02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:14.772
PROGRAMS IS THAT THE STAFF

02:25:14.839 --> 02:25:16.240
TYPICALLY COME FROM THE SAME

02:25:16.307 --> 02:25:17.442
COMMUNITIES AS THE STUDENTS

02:25:17.508 --> 02:25:19.510
THEY SERVE. SO THEY HAVE

02:25:19.577 --> 02:25:22.080
RELATIONSHIPS. WITH THE KIDS

02:25:22.146 --> 02:25:24.182
AND THE FAMILIES. THAT MAKES

02:25:24.248 --> 02:25:25.716
THEM EXCEPTIONALLY VALUABLE IN

02:25:25.783 --> 02:25:27.718
THIS CONTEXT AND ESPECIALLY

02:25:27.785 --> 02:25:29.287
AROUND THIS VERY REAL CHALLENGE

02:25:29.353 --> 02:25:30.655
OF CONNECTING WITH DISCONNECTED

02:25:30.721 --> 02:25:33.825
KIDS. AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW TO

02:25:33.891 --> 02:25:35.259
RE OPEN IN THE NEW SCHOOL YEAR

02:25:35.326 --> 02:25:36.461
WITH DRAMATICALLY ADJUSTED

02:25:36.527 --> 02:25:38.663
SCHOOL SCHEDULES AND THE NEED

02:25:38.729 --> 02:25:40.164
FOR SMALLER GROUPS AND PHYSICAL

02:25:40.231 --> 02:25:42.166
DISTANCE THING AND INTENSE

02:25:42.233 --> 02:25:44.335
NEEDS FOR SOCIAL CONNECTION. WE

02:25:44.402 --> 02:25:45.770
HAVE TO LEAN ON OUR AFTER

02:25:45.837 --> 02:25:46.737
SCHOOL PROGRAMS IN A VERY BIG

02:25:46.804 --> 02:25:49.373
WAY. WITH CLASS TIME

02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:51.275
POTENTIALLY HAPPENING AND SHIPS

02:25:51.342 --> 02:25:52.477
ARE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS CAN

02:25:52.543 --> 02:25:54.579
ALSO OPERATE IN SHIFTS. AND

02:25:54.645 --> 02:25:56.447
PROGRAMS CAN USE THAT TIME TO

02:25:56.514 --> 02:25:58.282
HELP KIDS COMPLETE CLASS WORK

02:25:58.349 --> 02:26:00.251
OR WITH HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS TO

02:26:00.318 --> 02:26:02.086
DO ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES.

02:41:44.895 --> 02:41:47.030
INTO THIS AS WELL A LITTLE BIT

02:41:47.097 --> 02:41:52.936
MORE PRESS. SURE AT THE START

REQUEST TO JUST HELP OUR

MINIMUM WAGE WHICH IS SET TO GO

02:42:07.350 --> 02:42:12.456
UP AGAIN IN JANUARY AND SO.

02:42:12.522 --> 02:42:14.691
WE'VE BEEN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

02:42:14.758 --> 02:42:16.259
HOW THE PROGRAMS WILL STAY

02:42:16.326 --> 02:42:19.329
AFLOAT GIVEN A CUT OR EVEN

02:42:29.806 --> 02:42:32.142
PAYING STAFF MINIMUM WAGE NOW

02:42:32.209 --> 02:42:35.112
IT'S UNCLEAR TO US HOW WE WILL

02:42:35.178 --> 02:42:36.880
CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THIS WORK

02:42:36.947 --> 02:42:39.082
FORCE AT THE LEVEL THAT WE HAVE

02:42:39.149 --> 02:42:43.019
IT NOW- SO THAT. THAT'S AN

02:42:43.086 --> 02:42:45.622
UNRESOLVED QUESTION. YEAH AND

02:42:45.689 --> 02:42:47.791
JUST- I CONCUR WITH FIRST I

02:42:47.858 --> 02:42:48.725

THAT'S A BIGGER QUESTION BUT- I

02:43:09.112 --> 02:43:10.413
THINK THE POINT IS THAT IF YOU

02:43:10.480 --> 02:43:12.782
DON'T REALIZE THIS. IS JUST

02:43:12.849 --> 02:43:14.518
THAT MATH PLAYS OUT AND YOU

02:43:14.584 --> 02:43:17.020
SIR. FOR YOUR KIDS. THAT'S

02:43:17.087 --> 02:43:17.921
RIGHT AMOUNT OF MONEY JUST

02:43:26.029 --> 02:43:27.531
BUT OUR BUDGET. SAID THAT WE

02:43:27.597 --> 02:43:28.932
WANT TO REJECT REGARDLESS OF

02:43:28.999 --> 02:43:30.834
THAT TRIGGERS ARE NOT. THE

02:43:30.901 --> 02:43:32.502
CATEGORICAL CUTS TO ASUS

02:43:32.569 --> 02:43:34.437
BECAUSE- IT WOULD WE NEED IT

02:43:34.504 --> 02:43:36.439
MORE THAN EVER NOW AND THEN THE

02:43:36.506 --> 02:43:38.508
REALITY CHECK IS WE WOULD SERVE

02:43:38.575 --> 02:43:40.844
FEWER KIDS. RIGHT HAD TO MAKE

02:43:40.911 --> 02:43:42.612
THE REDUCTIONS PLUS. THE

02:43:42.679 --> 02:43:44.014
MINIMUM WAGE WE NEED ACTUALLY

02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:45.649
AN INCREASE TO JUST.

OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY FOR THE

02:43:55.058 --> 02:43:57.394
PROGRAMS SO CURRENTLY THE EIGHT

02:43:57.460 --> 02:43:58.461
DOLLARS AN EIGHTY EIGHT CENTS

02:43:58.528 --> 02:44:00.397
IS LIKE I SAID IT'S BASED ON A

02:44:00.463 --> 02:44:02.866
THREE HOUR UNIT OF SERVICE- YOU

02:44:02.933 --> 02:44:04.534

THE PROGRAMS TO WORK DIFFERENT

02:44:08.838 --> 02:44:10.707
HOURS- NOT HAVE TO TAKE

02:44:10.774 --> 02:44:11.875
ATTENDANCE AT CENTER OVER THE

02:44:11.942 --> 02:44:13.476
LAST FEW MONTHS BECAUSE OF THE

02:44:13.543 --> 02:44:15.679
SITUATION. THAT OPERATIONAL

02:44:15.745 --> 02:44:17.180
FLEXIBILITY IS GOING TO

02:44:17.247 --> 02:44:19.316
CONTINUE TO BE NEEDED IN AN

02:44:19.382 --> 02:44:22.485
ONGOING WAY. AND SO ONE OF THE

02:44:22.552 --> 02:44:23.086
THINGS THAT WERE REALLY HOPING

02:44:23.153 --> 02:44:25.722
FOR. IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:44:25.789 --> 02:44:28.225
EDUCATION CAN HAVE. SOME MORE

02:44:28.291 --> 02:44:30.093
AUTHORITY IN AN ONGOING WAY

02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:32.395
AROUND LOOKING AT THAT DAILY

02:44:32.462 --> 02:44:35.065
RATE. HOURS OF OPERATION AT

02:44:35.131 --> 02:44:36.600
CETERA SO THERE CAN BE A LOT OF

02:44:36.666 --> 02:44:38.168
FLEXIBILITY IN THE SYSTEM IN

02:44:38.235 --> 02:44:39.903
THE COMING YEAR TO BE ABLE TO

02:44:41.271 --> 02:44:43.073
NEEDS WITH THE HOURS OF

02:44:43.139 --> 02:44:44.507
SERVICE. BUT IT REALLY NEEDS

02:44:44.574 --> 02:44:47.244
AND THAT COULD END UP SERVING

02:44:47.310 --> 02:44:48.612
SLIGHTLY FEWER KIDS THAN WERE

02:44:48.678 --> 02:44:50.947
SERVING NOW. BUT I THINK WITH

02:44:51.014 --> 02:44:54.284
WE DO THAT IN A TARGETED WAY.

02:44:54.351 --> 02:44:54.918
IT'S BETTER THAN LOSING A HUGE

02:44:54.985 --> 02:44:56.720
AMOUNT OF OUR WORK FORCE WHICH

02:44:56.786 --> 02:44:58.255
