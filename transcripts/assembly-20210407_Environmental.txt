OF RABBIT THAT WAY YOU CAN SEE ALL OF US AT ONCE AND- IT'S EASY FOR THE TV TO SEE YOU AS WELL SO. ALL RIGHT- MADAM ASSEMBLY MEMBER PLEASE- WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU DR CORK AND MEMBERS I'M HERE 2% AB ONE I LIKE TO THINK THAT IT'S THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY FOR THE ASSEMBLY I DON'T KNOW THAT EVERYONE AGREES WITH ME- BUT AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR YEARS. THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN RACINE A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE TSC INCLUDE AN EXTREMELY LONG PERMIT PROCESS TIMES. POINT FOR SPENT THE LATE SITES REMEDIATION AND FAILURE TO RESPOND TO PUBLIC CONCERNS. WE HAVE MADE NUMEROUS LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS OVER THE YEARS I TO IMPROVE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE TNC. BUT PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE EITHER VETO TO SUCH EFFORTS ARE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE. THE DEPARTMENT WERE UNDER WAY. OUR FIRST NONE OF THESE A HAVE. IN SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVE TO ITS OPERATIONS WHICH IS MY LAST YEAR WE INTRODUCED AND PASSED AB NINE NINE FIVE. UNFORTUNATELY THE GOVERNOR VETOED AB NINE NINE FIVE. I THINK THE LEGISLATURE TO FURTHER FISCAL FOR FURTHER FISCAL RESOURCES FOR THE DEPARTMENT. WE'VE INTRODUCED AB ONE WITH THE SAME IDENTICAL LANGUAGE LAST YEAR SYNDICATE OUR COMMITMENT TO THE REFORMS WE NEGOTIATED AS A BASELINE FOR NEGOTIATIONS. AB ONE STARTS HIGH LEVEL ACCESS TO RESET THE TNC INTO DEPARTMENT THAT IS MORE TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE. THE BILL MAKES FOUR CATEGORIES THE PARTY GOT PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES THAT IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL TO IMPROVE DGSE. NUMBER ONE IT CREATES A BOARD OF ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY WHICH IS A POLICY SAID IN A PRIMITIVE HILLS BODY L. CONSIST OF FIVE MEMBERS. NUMBER TWO TAKES ACTION TO HELP REFOCUS DGSE ON ITS CORE. MISSION CRITICAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF PROTECTING THE PUBLIC AND THE ENVIRONMENT FROM TOXIC SUBSTANCES. NUMBER THREE IT REESTABLISHES THAT THE TASK FORCE TO SET UP A PATHWAY TO VALIDATE THE TACC STRUCTURE AND IDENTIFY FUNDING STRUCTURE THAT WOULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES FOR THE DEPARTMENT. TO CARRY OUT ITS MANDATE. NUMBER FOUR MAKE STATUTORY CHANGES TO IMPROVE AND SPEED UP PERMITTING PROCESS THIS. THAT ALSO ENSURES PROPER FINANCIAL ASSURANCES ARE IN PLACE. I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS BEFORE THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THIS YEAR THAT ASPECT THAT MANY OF THE ELEMENTS OF AB ONE BUT AS IDENTIFIED IN THE ANALYSIS THERE ARE STILL SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES. ADMINISTRATION IS CURRENTLY ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS IN THE LEGISLATURE NEGOTIATIONS TO WORK THROUGH THESE DIFFERENCES I AM HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL GET TO A LOT OF COMMON GROUND AND TO- TO THE SAME PAGE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO PROVIDED THE LEGISLATURE WITH INFORMATION UNDER FISCAL SHORTFALLS INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR TWO FOR. THIRTY TWO YEARS AND ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THIS INFORMATION. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE FINALLY CAN GET SIGNIFICANT EVENT STARTS IMPROVING DGSE AND PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS BILL WILL NOT SOLVE ALL OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THE DEPARTMENT THAT'LL HELP PLACE THE TO SEE A MORE SOLID FISCAL GROUND. I TO ENSURE COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE- MY COMMUNITY HAS BEEN A POSTER TILE ON TOXICS FOR A WHILE YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT EXCITED THOUGHT THE ONLY THING PLAGUING US AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE DO NOT HAVE ANYMORE EXCEPT IN THE FUTURE WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I WILL. I THANK. MATT ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I TO SAY THE- THIS IS EVEN IF THIS BECOMES A- A- THE ATTACHED TO THE BUDGET THAT. THIS IS THE MOST WHAT THIS MAY BE THE ONE POLICY HEARING THAT WE HAVE SO WHEN WEEK AFTER WE'VE HEARD THE WITNESSES I REALLY DO WANT TO HEAR. IN DETAIL. HOPEFULLY SHORT DETAIL BUT IN DETAIL BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE THREE HOURS OR TWO AND A HALF HOURS LEFT I MAY GO TO TWELVE THIRTY SO PERHAPS WE HAVE THREE HOURS WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME BUT I STILL THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IT PROBABLY IS THE ONLY POLICY HEARING. AND- I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA HAS WORKED ON THIS BILL GIVING US A CHANCE TO COMMENT ON IT IT'S BEEN A TWO YEAR EFFORT TO- WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS SIMILAR TO THIS- DIRT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BUT IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR US IN THIS HEARING TO GIVE THE ADMINISTRATION FEEDBACK IN FACT THEY WANT THAT FEEDBACK. THEY WANT TO HEAR FROM US SO YOUR- TESTIMONY TODAY IS GOING TO BE DOUBLY IMPORTANT- SO. AND THE OTHER POINT THAT HAS BEEN MADE TO BY MANY OF YOU IS WELL D. TSC HAS HAD PROBLEMS HOW CAN WE BE ASSURED THAT- D. TSC WILL USE ADDITIONAL MONIES PROPERLY- AND- I'LL JUST SAY THAT THAT WITHOUT THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS STILL NEVER RECOVERED- TODAY WE WILL BE JOINED BY MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION THAT CAN SPEAK TO THE POLICIES BEING PUT FORWARD BY THE BILL. AS WELL AS THE SIMILAR POLICIES BEING PUT FORWARD THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- CHAU PHONE MODERATOR WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WELL NOTHING. WE HAVE A WITNESS IN THE BUILDING OR NOT YEAH. OKAY SO OUR PHONE MONITOR WE WISH TO HEAR FROM THE IT THE- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT FIRST ON KEPT EIGHT WITH THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC BALANCE NOW LET'S SEE C. B. C. D. E. B.

GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DON CAP HE MCCUE CAPTAIN EXISTENCE I'M HAPPY CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC BALANCE SHEET IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB ONE- BY THE NUMBER YOU KNOW BECAUSE- AS YOU MAY BE AWARE SIVA WHAT CAUSED AND THEN FAITH THE PATH TWO A HALF YEARS WITH THIS WOMAN AMBIENT ON FOR REFORM PRODUCCI TO SEE MOST NOTABLY VIA HER EIGHT NINE NINE FIVE TWENTY TWO. WHICH WAS PLEASED WITH THE CALL AMEND MY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE KEY CONCERN AND CRY ALL OF OUR- WHILE MUCH WORK WILL STREETS A AB ONE AS OF STEP TO FULLY ADDRESS ISSUES RAISED BY THE AND OTHER STATES OF TRENT. ACCOUNTABILITY RESPOND UNTIMELY OF THE ACROSS AT A GRAND AREA QUIPPER TO BE ESTABLISHED OF A DE GOVERNING SHE WAS WRONG COMPUTER WITH THE TO POLITICAL OF HOW WHICH GENERATES MANAGEMENT REMEDIATION AND UP AFTER IN THE STATE ISSUES RELATED TO HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT AND CLEANUP COMP ISSUE THAT WEREN'T ALLOWED UP TAX AND PROFESSIONAL. AND MEMBERSHIP OF ANY PROPOSED BOARD EVEN NOW THE THIS ARE YOU THE SUB OF MUCH COMP AND CONCERN FROM CAN AND BUSINESS SECTOR- LIKE IT IS IMPAIR AND ESTABLISHING THE BORDER ENVIRONMENT SAFETY UNDER AB ONE MM OF TO SERVE ON THE BOARD HAVE ACTS WERE TO THE COMPLEX ISSUES THAT APPOINTMENT BE MADE POLITICAL CHEN. WE BELIEVE AB ONE HAS STRUCK THE RIGHT BALANCE TO THAT THAT MEANS IN ADDITION TO THE STRUCTURAL PROGRAMMATIC AND REGULATORY REFORMS AB ONE SEEKS TO MAKE WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO SEE THE IF MEMBERS IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE FOR SHORT TERM FEE INCREASES WITHIN HELPLESSLY CONTROL ACCOUNT TO SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT ACTIVITIES AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE HOUSES WHICH MANAGEMENT PLAN AND FREE TAX COURSE. NOTABLY A GREEN CHEVY SHORT TERM FEE INCREASES NOT COME LIGHTLY FOR STEVEN IT'S NOT WHO ALREADY STRADDLED WITH INCREASED COSTS WITH THOSE WITH PTSD- OVERSIGHT PERMITTING WITHOUT COURSE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR- CUSTOMER WAS VERY COOL- NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM CAROLINE FOR. A BEHALF OF. THE CENTRE FOR ON RACE POWER IN THE IN- MADAM FARRELLY PURSUE WITH YOUR- THANK YOU GOOD MORNING KEVIN CORKE CHAIR SMITH AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M CAROLINE FERRELL WITH THE CENTER AND REYES PYRENEAN VARMINT I APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA'S EFFORTS TO ADVANCE A LONG OVER DUE PROCESS. TO HOLD THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNTABLE TO MEET ITS FUNDAMENTAL OBLIGATION TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. DGFT HAS FAILED IN ITS IN ITS SIGNIFICANT LEGAL MANDATE TO ENFORCE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. IMPACTED COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE INSIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE NEEDED FOR THE AGENCY. FOR EIGHT YEARS CRP IS BEEN WORKING WITH MEMBERS OF THE PEOPLE SENATE PARTICULARLY GROUPS LIKE COMMITTEE FOR BETTER ARVIN COMMITTEE FOR BETTER SHAFTER AND DELINO GUARDIANS FOR GOVERNANCE CHANGES LIKE A BOARD TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WE KNOW THOUGH THAT FOR THE BOARD TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT TO THE AGENCY IT NEEDS TO BE THOUGHTFULLY COMPOSED AND ADDITIONAL REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURES NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT ANY INCREASE IN FEE OF FORTY NEEDS TO BE PRECEDED BY ONGOING OVERSIGHT BY THE PUBLIC IN THE LEGISLATURE AND REFLECT THE POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION AND IMPACTED COMMUNITIES TO INFORM YOU TNC IS ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESS AND PRIORITIZE THE NEEDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN HARMED BY HAZARDOUS WASTE MISMANAGEMENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ALSO FOR BEING IN TIME. UP NEXT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM A JARED BLUMENFELD OF THE SECRETARY OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY MR BLUMENFELD- COULD YOU COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU CHECK WORK- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HI MY NAME IS GERRY BLUMENFELD I'M THE SECRETARY OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY- AND THE T. S. C. IS ONE OF THE BOARDS DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICES THAT I'VE SPENT. THE MOST AMOUNT OF TIME FROM DAY ONE ON THIS ISSUE- DOES TO FRAME IT FROM A CRITICAL PERSPECTIVE IF YOU THINK ABOUT COMMUNITIES AROUND CALIFORNIA- AND WHAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IF YOU LIVE NEXT TO- OLD HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITY THAT HASN'T BEEN CLEANED UP. THINK ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT HAS ON YOUR PROPERTY VALUES ON THE- PSYCHOLOGY ON WORRY ABOUT YOUR KIDS PLAYING OUT THAT THERE IS BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND. AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SITES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CLEANED UP IN CALIFORNIA SO THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM REALLY DEMANDS AS ADDRESS THIS ISSUE- I REALLY WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA WE WORKED IN COLLABORATION WITH HOW OFFICE AND MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT YOU HAD TESTIFYING TODAY. THIS IS- AT ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY I WANT TO SAY THAT THAT WE TAKE THIS INCREDIBLY SERIOUSLY- FROM DAY ONE YOU'LL HEAR FROM MEREDITH WILLIAMS DR WILLIAMS I'M HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE INCOMPETENT LEAD- IN MAKING SURE ALL WE DON'T WAIT FOR CHANGES TO COME THAT WE MAKE THEM AND MAKE THAT. THE ORGANIZATION AS EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE AS IT POSSIBLY CAN BE BUT THESE CHANGES INSTITUTIONAL REFORM CHANGES THAT MANY PEOPLE WOULD SAY WOW WE COULDN'T WE JUST DO SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ACT I WANT TO POSIT THAT THIS IS THE TIME TO HELP THIS AGENCY CHANGE THERE'S A LOT RIGHT WITH THE T. S. C. AND THE LAW. THAT WE STILL NEED IN TIMES OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT THAT I THINK WE'RE IN AGREEMENT ON SO I WOULD SAY THAT THE- THE TRAILER BILL WHICH IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX PAGES- AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA SAID IT INCORPORATES A GREAT DEAL OF THE NEGOTIATION THE- BEEN WORKING ON. TOGETHER I DIDN'T HAVE AND IN THE HUNT OF OUR OF ME ON THE DS REFORM I WANT TO THANK ALL THE STAFF AND CONSULTANTS THAT WEB FOR THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN THAT. THE TRAILER BILL- ALSO HAS THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO STOP THE PROCESS OF INVESTIGATING THOSE SITES I WAS DESCRIBING OF STARTING TO CLEAN THEM UP. THE BUILDING ECONOMIC RECOVERY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BIDEN- PRESIDENT BIDEN'S BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN. THERE'S A WHOLE SECTION ON HOW WE HELP DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND ONE OF THOSE. IS TO GET RID OF THE BLIGHT. OF TOXIC SITES. DGSE ALSO NEEDS TO MAKE SURE ALL THAT IN THE FUTURE. CALIFORNIA IS LEADING SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND CHEMICALS IN THE PRODUCTS THAT WE BUY YOU SHOULDN'T NEED A PHD LIKE MEREDITH. IN ORDER TO BUY SHAMPOO OR SOAP ALL THINGS FEEL FAMILY AND UNFORTUNATELY. WE DO BECAUSE THE LEGISLATION IS AND- AND THE TNCS AUTHORITY COULD COULD REALLY BE DAHLE SAID IN THIS CASE SO FOR ME. THIS IS THE YEAR TO GET IT DONE. RIGHT WE CANNOT WAIT. I REALLY LIKE FROM FROM MY HOT MY PRIORITY. LIKE I WILL DO EVERYTHING THAT I CAN DO WHAT WITH YOU AND STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE WE GET THIS DONE BECAUSE IT CANNOT. LANGUAGE ANOTHER YEAR AND I'M LIKE. YOU KNOW HOW THE ISSUES WITH A SPECIFIC FACILITY LIKE EXIDE. THIS IS THE WHOLE KIT AND CABOODLE THIS IS EVERYTHING- AND WE WILL BE PUTTING PEOPLE'S LIVES AND COMMUNITIES AT RISK IF WE DON'T ACHIEVE REFORM THIS YET SO. I WILL WORK THROUGHOUT. ANY PROCESS THAT ANYONE ENGAGES- IN ORDER TO SELL SOME OF THESE ISSUES. THE ONLY DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHAT ASSEMBLY MAN GOT- ASSEMBLY WHEN WE GOT TO SEE A SAID OF MYSELF IS I FEEL LIKE THE BRIDGE HAS BEEN REALLY NARROWED TO A FEW. KEY ISSUES AND I CAN SEE THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. TO THE D. S. C. REFORM SO I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU AND ADVANCE. FOR HELPING MAKE THIS HAPPEN I THINK WHEN WE LOOK BACK ON THIS VICTORY. WE CAN BE REALLY PROUD THAT WE BUILD A BETTER AGENCY THAT WE GOT GOOD GOVERNANCE IN PLACE AND THAT WE PROTECT IT CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE. WAITED A VERY VERY LONG TIME FOR THIS THANK YOU. THE BILL. ALL RIGHT THERE'S BEEN IN MOTION AND A SECOND. WELL NOW HERE- FOR FIRST AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR SECRETARY FOR TAKING TIME OUT OF YOUR BUSY DAY. OTHER SHOWS YOUR DEDICATION TO GETTING THINGS RIGHT TO DTS SAY. NEXT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM DR MEREDITH WILLIAMS DIRECTOR OF DTS SEE- PLEASE- TESTIFY. AND IF YOU CAN WHEN YOU TESTIFY IF YOU COULD TALK ABOUT- THE DIFFERENCES OR PERHAPS A SECRETARY WANT TO DO THAT. BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL AND WHAT YOU HEAR. HAVE HERE SO WE CAN GIVE FEEDBACK ON IT. THANK YOU CHAIR CORK THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND A SPECIAL THANKS TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA. I THINK YOU NEED TO GET CLOSER TO THE MICROPHONE. IS THAT BETTER. THAT'S MUCH BETTER OKAY SO- THANK YOU CHAIR CORK AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND A SPECIAL THANKS TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA. FOR KEEPING THIS ISSUE IN FRONT OF YOU IN FRONT OF THE PUBLIC IN FRONT OF. ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS SO THAT WE CAN TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO REALLY RESOLVE THE ISSUES WITH THE DEPARTMENT OR TAKE THIS MAJOR STEP TOWARD RESOLVING ISSUES. AS YOU ALL KNOW WE STARTED THIS PROCESS LAST YEAR COVERT CAME ALONG WE'VE- MADE GREAT PROGRESS THROUGH EIGHTY NINE NINE FIVE AND LEARNED A LOT FROM THAT AND AS A RESULT. THE PROPOSAL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PUT FORTH IN THE TRAILER BILL THIS YEAR. DOES ADDRESS MANY OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS LAST YEAR AND MANY OF THE ELEMENTS OF NINE NINE FIVE. THERE ARE SOME SOME DIFFERENCES THAT WE ARE- BETWEEN LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR AND I WILL HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THEM NUMBER ONE. WE HAVE NOW COMPLETED THOSE WORKLOAD ANALYSES THAT REALLY TELL THE WORLD WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH OUR RESOURCES. WHAT IS IT THAT WE- ARE ABLE TO ADDRESS IN TERMS OF OUR STATUTORY MANDATES AND REQUIREMENTS AND WHAT WE CAN'T DO BECAUSE WE LACK THE RESOURCES AND IN. KEEPING WITH THAT D. ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS COMPREHENSIVE IT IS THE TRANSPARENCY IT IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY BUT IT'S ALSO THE FULL FISCAL ACCOUNT FULL. FISCAL STABILITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT BOTH IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING VERY. CRITICAL NEED IN THE SHORT TERM. THANK LIKE MAKING SURE WE MAINTAIN OUR FEDERAL DELEGATION TO IMPLEMENT AND PROVIDE OVERSIGHT FOR REGRET- THINGS LIKE MAKING SURE WE'RE ENFORCING IN THESE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WE'VE PUT IN ENOUGH. WE'RE WE'RE NOT JUST CLOSING THAT GENERAL FUND GAP. WE'RE ALSO INCREASING ENOUGH OF THE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CRITICAL NEEDS IT IS NOT THE FULL SOLUTION FOR THE LONG TERM BUT- WE WOULD NOW HAVE A BOARD THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT FEEL FLORIDA E. TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE MANDATES THAT WE HAVE. AND MAKE THOSE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE AND WHERE THE FUNDING SHOULD BE TO MEET THOSE PRIORITIES. SO IT'S A GOOD START IN THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS A IS A- TERRIFIC DOWN PAYMENT IT WOULD ACCELERATE OUR ABILITY. TO BUILD THE CAPACITY FOR AN INVESTIGATION INSIGHT DISCOVERY PROGRAM. AND HAVE THAT IN PLACE SO THAT IF WE GET THE LONG TERM FUNDING WE CAN THEN BUILD ON THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND START TO CHIP AWAY. AT THAT- AT THAT. THAT HUGE NUMBER OF SITES AROUND THE STATE SO ONE OF THE BIG DIFFERENCES IS THAT WE ARE NOT CALLING FOR A FEW TASK FORCE BECAUSE WE DONE THE ANALYSIS. ON THE FEES WE'VE PUT FORTH A FEE STRUCTURE THAT SIMPLIFIED IT STREAMLINED. IT IT HOW HE KEEPS IN MIND SOME OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC. AND THE BURDENS AND MAKING AND WE'RE MINDFUL OF THAT TOO IT'S BASED ON A POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE. AND AND IT IT WILL SERVE US IT WILL SERVE US TILL SUCH TIME AS A BOARD CAN DECIDE WHAT ADDITIONAL CHANGES MIGHT NEED TO BE MADE DOWN THE ROAD. AND INCLUDING- JUST CONTINUE YOU KNOW OUR FEES HAVE NOT BEEN ADJUSTED SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THAT BUT IT BEARS REPEATING. THAT IT YOU KNOW WE CAN'T WAIT. WE WE'RE ALREADY A YEAR LATE BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. AND NOW TO WAIT AGAIN FOR A FEW TASK FORCE TO COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL WE THINK WOULD BE. QUITE CHALLENGING FOR US AND FOR THE DEPARTMENT JUST BECAUSE OF THE BURDENS ON THE GENERAL FUND. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES- AND THEN I WOULD I WOULD ONLY HIGHLIGHT THAT- WE ARE HAVING ONGOING ENGAGEMENT WITH YOU I'VE NEVER HAD THE% OPPORTUNITY MAYBE MEET WITH SOME OF YOU ONE ON ONE. THE LEDGE THAT HAS MADE THEMSELVES AVAILABLE FOR WEEKLY DETAILED DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT THE ISSUES ARE AND WHERE THEY KEEP POINTS OF CONCERN ARE WE'RE HAVING SIMILAR MEETINGS. WITH COMMUNITY BASED JUST THE ORGANIZATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS AND WITH THE REGULATED COMMUNITY AND IT'S THROUGH THAT PROCESS THAT WE WILL REALLY UNDERSTAND. WHAT ELSE NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN ORDER FOR US TO HAVE ENOUGH ALIGNMENT TO MOVE THIS FORWARD THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. WITH THAT I WILL STOP THERE AND HAPPY TO BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. THAT YOU PROVIDED FOR THE ENGAGEMENT FOR THE LEAD STAFF ENGAGEMENT AND FOR FUTURE DISCUSSIONS TO KEEP KEEP THE PROCESS MOVING SO DR MEREDITH IF YOU COULD STAY UP FOR MANAGER. SO WHAT ARE THE MAIN DIFFERENCES RIGHT NOW BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL AND THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US IN AB ONE. WELL NUMBER ONE FIRST AND FOREMOST I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FEW TASK FORCE- WE ARE NOT CALLING FOR A FEW TASK FORCE BECAUSE WE FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT THE ANALYSIS WE'VE DONE IN THE BASIS FOR RAISING THE FEES- AND- AND WE LOOKED AT A NUMBER. OF POSSIBLE MODELS TO STRUCTURE THE FEES AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BOTH TASK AT HAND TO SPEAK MORE DIRECTLY INTO THE WE'RE TOUGH WE'RE WE ARE PROPOSING CHANGES TO BOTH TOSCA AND THE HEAT H. W. CA. FUNDING SO IT'S MORE COMPREHENSIVE IN THAT SENSE- SO THAT I THINK THAT THE FEE STRUCTURE IS THE BIGGEST- DIFFERENCE THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF THE CONSTITUENCIES IN THE BOARDS AND SOME OF THE DETAILS BUT HONESTLY.I DON'T SEE THOSE AS BEING- AS- I ICS IS HAVING VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THOSE ISSUES AND I'M I'M OPTIMISTIC ABOUT RESOLUTION. ALL RIGHT SO FOR THE MEMBERS IF YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT PARTICULARLY THE FEE TASK FORCE NOT BEING HANDLED WILL WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU ABOUT THAT- I WILL ADD THAT I THINK THAT THE ADDITIONAL- PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ESSENTIAL AND THAT YOU CAN'T GET YOUR JOB DONE WITHOUT THEM. HOWEVER I KNOW THAT- MANY OF THE MEMBERS HERE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE MONEY BE WELL SPENT. AND THAT- GIVEN THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST HOW CAN WE BE ASSURED THAT THAT MONEY WILL BE WELL SPENT. WELL I THINK THE WORKLOAD ANALYSIS REALLY TELLS A STORY ABOUT HOW WE ARE SPENDING THE MONEY AND WHAT RESOURCES WE ARE- WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE RESOURCES AND WE CAN NOW BUILD ON THAT TO PROVIDE ONGOING TRANSPARENCY ABOUT OUR USE OF RESOURCES SO. NUMBER ONE THAT EFFORT IS NOT A ONE AND DONE IT WILL BE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION- I'M NUMBER TWO I THINK THERE ARE. SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR NUMBER ONE THERE WAS SOME CONCERN THAT WE WEREN'T INCREASING THE LEVEL OF SERVICE OF THE DEPARTMENT AND NOW WE'RE PROPOSING TO DO THAT. BUT NUMBER TWO WE HEARD THAT THERE WASN'T ENOUGH ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE PROPOSAL THAT WE PUT FORTH LAST YEAR AND A LOT OF THOSE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES WERE TAKEN. INTO ACCOUNT. IN NINE NINE FIVE AND WE HAVE ADOPTED A LOT OF THOSE AND WE'RE TRYING TO SEE IF THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO GO EVEN FURTHER INCLUDING. DEADLINES IN PLACE REPORTING OUT TO THE BOARD WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE MEETING OUR COMMITMENTS FOR PERMIT DECISIONS- TACKLING. JUST JUST. SHARING WHAT OUR STRATEGY IS WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON. AND THEN I WILL SAY THAT INTERNALLY EVEN WITHOUT A BOARD I AM WORKING HARD TO FIND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY. I WILL SAY THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED OPPORTUNITIES AND PITFALLS. OF REMOTE MEETINGS FOR INSTANCE SO IT PROVIDES A LOT OF TRANSPARENCY IT TOOK US AWHILE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD HAVE THOSE MEETINGS IN A WAY THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS COULD BE HEARD- BUT WE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO HEAR CONCERNS AND ADDRESS THEM- SAID AND WE'VE- WE'VE REESTABLISHED OUR PUBLIC MEETINGS INDEPENDENT AGAIN OF A BOARD AND THOSE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO. TO GET FEEDBACK FROM OUR STAKEHOLDERS. OKAY AND I WILL NOTE THAT C. WHICH REPRESENTS- MANY OF THOSE BUSINESS INTERESTS THAT WILL BE TAXED OR- HAVE INCREASED IN FEES. I IS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. OKAY NEXT. SO. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WISHES TO SPEAK IN- IN THE ROOM MOTION IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. OR IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM. ALL RIGHT AND THEN IS THERE ANYONE IN THIS ROOM ARE ON THE- CONFERENCE WHO IS A PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION.

THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT ALL I'LL BE VERY BRIEF SO FIRST LET ME THINK WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE AUTHORS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE GOVERNANCE. AND STABILIZE THE FISCAL PUTTING OF DTS GOING FORWARD WE STRONGLY AGREE WITH THOSE EFFORTS AND WANT TO HELP SUPPORT AB ONE IN THAT RESPECT. BUT ON BEHALF OF OUR THIRTY SEVEN RURAL COUNTIES WE DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT AB ONE TO REPEAL OF SEVERAL LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THE EXEMPTIONS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE COST AND COULD PUSH THOSE LOCAL HAZARDOUS WASTE HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE AND USED OIL COLLECTION PROGRAMS. PAST THEIR BREAKING POINTS. NEED COST INCREASES WILL BE WORN BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT DON'T CONTROL THE GENERATION OF THOSE WASTE AND OFTEN OPERATE ON LIMITED BUDGETS ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS WITH LOW POPULATIONS. WE HEAR THESE INCREASED OPERATING COSTS AND GATE FEES COULD REDUCE THE CONVENIENCE OF SAFE DISPOSAL OPPORTUNITIES.

I DO TO HAVE CONCERNS- COMING FROM A ROLL DISTRICT IT IT ALWAYS KINDA. THROWS THAT RED FLAG OF CAUTION- WHEN- WE HEAR FROM OUR ROLE COUNTY SUCH. BLOOD IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I UNDERSTAND IT'S IS A VERY TOUGH NEEDLE TO THREAD I KNOW ANYTIME THAT WE LOOK AT. CHANGING HOW FEES ARE DONE AND HOW WE CONDUCT THINGS IN AND WE'VE SEEN THIS WITH DIFFERENT PIECES OF LEGISLATION. OVER OUR TEN YEAR HERE- EVERYBODY ALWAYS GETS WORRIED THAT EVERYBODY ALWAYS GETS NERVOUS. AND I KNOW THIS ISN'T AN EASY TASK AND I LIKE TO JOINT AUTHORS THIS ENDEAVOR WITH YOU- I'M SURE I'LL GET FLAK FOR IT. BUT FOLKS TRUST US WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR AWHILE- LET'S WORK OUT THE KINKS LET'S ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS FROM OUR ROLE COUNTIES. I DO REPRESENT THE THIRD LARGEST DISTRICT IN THE STATE. ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE AND- I KNOW THERE'S CONCERNS AND I KNOW TOGETHER WE CAN WORK THROUGH THOSE- SO IF YOU'RE WILLING TO HAVE ME AND HAVE ME BE UP A LITTLE BIT ON THOSE CONCERNS- MORE THAN HAPPY TO JOIN AUTHOR THIS. AND PUSH BACK- ON THE ADMINISTRATION A LITTLE BIT AND GET GET THIS TORRENT ACTUALLY NEEDS TO BE. BEFORE WE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR THE OURS ADD THEY HAVE GREAT PART AGREE ADVOCATE AND- AM WHO. THAT WE GET TO A COMMON GROUND THAT IS WITH THEM ALL WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS. AND DISCOUNT WAIT I WILL SAY WELL THIS IS PERSONAL I LIVE IN ONE OF THESE COMMUNITIES THAT'S HIGHLY IMPACTED. THESE COMMUNITIES ARE ACROSS THE WHOLE STATE THIS APARTMENT SERVICES THE WHOLE STATE- AND SO IT'S REALLY SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS ALL OF US SENATE SHORTENS OUR LIFE IT MAKES A SICK OUT THERE AND SO. I WELCOME ALL THE SUPPORT- AND YOU KNOW I LIKE TO THINK THAT WE'RE IN THE- BUSINESS OF MAKING THE IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE AND THIS IS FILE IMPOSSIBLE FOR FIVE YEARS ACTUALLY- BUT I DO WANT TO APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION THEIR COMMITMENT- BOTTOM SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL AND DR WILLIAMS. TO TRY TO GET THERE ON AND SO I HAVE SEEN THEY GOT CLOSE FROM WHERE WE WERE AT. TO WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY I DO THINK THAT THE TASK FORCE IS AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON. OUT THERE AS WELL AND SO I AM I AM HOPEFUL THAT IT'LL GET DONE AND IF THEY GET FUN IN AB ONE OR IN A BILL. I'M HOPEFUL THAT WHATEVER GETS THEM WILL BE EVER STILL OF THE- COLLABORATIVE EFFORT THAT WE'VE HAD OVER THE YEARS AND DEFINITELY WALKING YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS THANK YOU AFTER. ALL. SO IF THE- BILL AUTHORED COULD. ANSWERED JUST TO QUESTION- AND THEN YOU'RE A REMARKS CAN COME IN CLOTHES AT LOW EBB ONES YOU ADDED BY YOU TALK ABOUT COOPERATE OF OTHERS- SO I SAW DOCTOR RANDY NOW. THEN BY BE RIVER. MADAM REBEKAH BY K. THANK YOU MISTER- SO I WANT TO READ- I GRATITUDE FOR THE AUTHOR WHO HAS WORKED. IS MENTION ON THIS AND TO REALLY GET US A PLACE WHERE WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO A DTS C. THAT IS. MORE SUCCESSFUL AND I ALSO WANT TO REITERATE MY GUIDED EVEN. SPECIAL DOCTOR WILL WHO'S BEEN BEFORE THIS NEWMAN TIMES. TO TALK TO US ABOUT OUR CONCERS WITH T. S. C. N. N. O. YOU HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK BOTH ON THIS EFFORT AND WITH INTERNALLY TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS MORE WORK BEING DONE FOR THESE COMMUNITIES THAT SO DOES THERE AT AND THE SECRETARIES DEDICATION TO THAT IS ALSO. REALLY COMMENDABLE AND IMPORTANT AND I WANT TO TOUCH ON. AGAIN SOMETHING THAT THE CHURCH SAID WHICH AND DOCTOR WILLIAMS ADDRESSED BRIEFLY WHICH IS. THIS OVERSIGHT PIECE I MEAN THIS FEE STRUCTURE INCREASES SIGNIFICANT AND I THINK WE SHOULD- BE COGNIZANT OF WHAT WE'RE ASKING BUSINESSES TO DO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I APPRECIATE THE POLLUTERS PAY MODEL I THINK- BUT I MY CONCERN REALLY LIES IN. HANDING MONEY TO OUR DEPARTMENT THAT HISTORICALLY HASN'T DONE WHAT WE NEED IT TO DO FOR THE COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW THERE'S OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND SITES THAT NEED TO BE CLEANED UP AND I WANT TO UNDERSTAND JUST. ON A DEEPER LEVEL AND IT'S LIKE THE AUTHOR TO ADDRESS THIS AND DOCTOR WILLIAMS IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO AS WELL. HOW WE ARE REALLY ON A GRANULAR LEVEL MAKING SURE WE'RE HITTING THOSE MILESTONES ARE NOT MONEY IS BEING SPENT TO GET THOSE COMMUNITIES. THE OUTCOMES THAT THEY NEED- AT AND I THINK THE THAT GETS THE- GAP STILL NEED TO CLOSE I THINK THAT SOME- DEADLINES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE BILL AND HAVING A BOARD HEALTH TO CREATE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY AS WELL ON THE TRANSPARENCY. AND THE ABILITY FOR THE PUBLIC OR THE STAKEHOLDERS TO PARTICIPATE. BUT I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE SPEED TEST VERSUS QUESTION YOU KNOW IS. IS PART OF THAT ALSO THERE'S A LOT AS A PATIENT. I WILL SAY THAT I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT PROPERLY FUNDED AND SO THAT IS A PIECE OF THE PROBLEM. BUT THAT CAN BE THAT'S NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM WE HAVE SERIOUS GOVERNANCE REFORM THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN- AND SO I THINK THAT THIS IS WHERE THIS RESTRUCTURE THIS QUESTION IS REALLY IMPORTANT. SO THAT THOSE THAT ARE PAINTED DIGITAL PHILLY FEES. FILL THAT THEY'RE GETTING THIS MONEY WE'RE STILL THAT THEY'RE NOT WAITING FOR YEARS FOR A PER MAP I'VE TALKED TO FOLKS HAVE BEEN. WAITING FOR A PERMIT APPROVAL FOR FIFTEEN YEARS THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE- IT MAKES US WONDER WHAT ELSE ARE HOLDING OFF ON UNTIL. I THINK THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE PIECES I WOULD SAY THAT. STAFF FROM- COMMITTEE HERE HAS BEEN. A REALLY ESSENTIAL IN THIS AN IF THAT DOESN'T ANSWER YOUR QUESTION CLEARLY. THEY CAN ADD TO THAT. I'M NOT GOING TO DO. TO DRESS IN A- SURE. SO I WOULD. FOR OF ALL THAT THE FEE AUTHORITY. BEING SICK RECOMMENDED. THE BOARD. MUST MODELED AFTER OTHERS. OR ARE AROUND THIS. WATER BOARD FOR A- DO. ANY PER. FEATURE WOULD GO THROUGH THE BUDGET AND APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS SO ULTIMATELY. THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE- THE FINAL SAY ON WHETHER OR NOT ANY FUTURE CHANGES. GO THROUGH SO THERE ARE PROVISIONS AND MAX THE MEANS THAT THE THAT THE ASSEMBLY AND THE- THE SENATE. USES TO KEEP US ACCOUNTABLE. AND TO- AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ON TRACK AND THAT WE'RE- TRUSTWORTHY WITH THE FUNDS. I WILL SAY I WISH I HAD TIME TO TELL SOME OF THE SUCCESS STORIES FOR THE DEPARTMENT TODAY I DO NOT- HOWEVER. I CAN SAY ONE OF THE SECRETARIES HIGHEST PRIORITIES HAS BEEN ENFORCEMENT. AND WE HAVE TAKEN THAT VERY MUCH TO HEART AND WE HAVE TAKEN STRONG ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS- WEEKLY. AGAINST AGAIN SOME OF THE MOST PROBLEMATIC TYPES OF FACILITIES IN THE STATE THAT ARE. IN THESE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. AND THAT'S JUST ONE PLACE WHERE I CAN HIGHLIGHT SOME OF OUR SUCCESS. AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING- THAT THAT SHOWS THAT THIS IS NOT. THE SAME D. TSC IT HAS EVOLVED IT'S RESPONDED TO THE PEOPLE SENATE. IT'S A NUMBER OF ISSUES IN THE PEOPLE SENATE REPORT. IT HAS RESPONDED TO MANY MANY OF THE FINDINGS WITH THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL. WE TAKE THE SAY HOT ANNUAL REPORT ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSICE PERFORMANCE VERY MUCH TO HEART. AND WE USE THAT TO MEASURE OUR PROGRESS AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE- WE'RE- HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND I THINK. I'LL NIELSEN SECRETARY. I WOULD JUST SAY HAVING THE POINT OF THE CALLIE PA AND LOOKING AT THE DAY BETWEEN THE- TILL. BOARD OF THE WATER BOARD AND THEN THE D. S. C. HAVE. A PUBLIC AB OVERSIGHT HEARING PROCESS WHERE. I WE'RE VERY FOCUSED- THE UNDERSECRETARY- SERENA MAXPOINT AND I ON KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS THAT THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS WHAT IS THE METRIC. WHAT IS THE METRIC WE LOOKING AT SO IS IT THE NUMBER OF INSPECTIONS IS THE POUNDS OF POLLUTION REDUCED IS THE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS IT THAT- THE FUNDS GOING TO COMMUNITIES. LIKE WE NEED DOES CLEARLY ARTICULATED ON A WEBSITE THAT SAYS HOW ARE WE DOING AGAINST OUR BENCHMARKS. THAT THEN. IN A PUBLIC SETTING LIKE THIS. MEREDITH WILL GO UP AND SAY THIS IS WALK WITH. DOING THIS IS WHAT WE HAVEN'T ACHIEVED WE DON'T HAVE THAT PROCESS. SO THE TRANSFORMATIVE POT HERE REALLY IS TO SAY. WE NEED WE NEED THE METRICS WE NEED PUBLIC OVERSIGHT. AND THEN WE NEED TO DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THOSE CHALLENGES ARE. THE ANALYSIS THAT CRISTINA- THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN GARCIA HELPED US. WITH MERIT IT'S REALLY PUSH FALL WITH TO LOOK AT THAT WHAT LED AN HOURS AS WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO HAVE AN INSPECTOR GO OUT AND THEN COME BACK AND BRING THAT CASE TO FRUITION SO WE NOW HAVE ALL THE PIECES THAT WE NEED. WHICH WE DIDN'T HAVE LAST YEAR OR THE YEAR BEFORE. TO PUT IN PLACE A SYSTEM DEAL POINT THAT WAX IS NOT JUST ONE ELEMENT. IT'S A SYSTEMIC APPROACH TO ACCOUNTABILITY- AND WILL THEY BE PROBLEMS YET BUT WILL KNOW WHAT THEY ARE IN REAL TIME. AS OPPOSED TO PUBLIC MEETINGS THAT I WENT TO PEOPLE LIKE. JARED YOU LAST WE ASK YOU TO DO THIS NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WE'VE NEVER HAD FROM THE DEPARTMENT. THAT WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN AGAIN. VERY GOOD- DO YOU HAVE UP FOR THE COURT FOR THE FOLLOW UPS.

VERY GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU I KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE 2% EIGHTY FOUR EIGHTY A MEASURE THAT WILL STRAIN LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTIONS AGAINST LOCAL THREATS TO THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH AND SAFETY INCLUDING THE ABILITY FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DIRECT A FACILITY OR PORTION OF THE FACILITY TO BE TEMPORARILY DISCONTINUED AT TO TEMPORARILY DISCONTINUE THE OPERATIONS THAT HAVE COST AND EXPOSURE- THIS IS A BILL THAT CAME ABOUT AFTER SEVERAL MEETINGS- REGARDING THE EXITE CONTAMINATION WHICH THIS COMMITTEE HAS HEARD QUITE OFTEN AND I WANNA THANK MY COLLEAGUE IS A MEMBER CRISTINA FOR BEING SUCH A CRISTINA GARCIA FOR BEING SUCH A CHAMPION. ON THAT ISSUE I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AB FOUR EIGHTY IS SUBSTANTIALLY A NARROWED VERSION- THAN ITS PREVIOUS VERSIONS CONSIDERED IN THIS COMMITTEE HOWEVER I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN ADDITION TO BEING AMENDMENTS REFLECTED IN THE LANGUAGE TODAY. IN CALIFORNIA MULTIPLE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE JURISDICTION OVER BUSINESSES THAT HANDLE OR GENERATE HAZARDOUS WASTE MATERIALS AND THAT POSE A RISK TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY LOCALLY A CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCY ALSO KNOWN AS COOPER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING AND ENFORCING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND WASTE LOSS AND THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER HAS GENERAL AUTHORITY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH AND EXPAND AUTHORITY ONLY AFTER A COUNTY WIDE EMERGENCY IS DECLARED CURRENTLY SOME FACILITIES THAT EMIT HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES CONTINUE TO OPERATE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT MEET REGULATORY MINIMUM STANDARDS TO CEASE OPERATIONS IMMEDIATELY. A PRIME EXAMPLE OF THIS TYPE OF ATROCITY IMPACTING OUR COMMUNITY BEING THE EXIDE BATTERY RECYCLING FACILITY IN VERNON CALIFORNIA WHICH CONTINUOUSLY EXPOSED FAMILIES AND RESIDENTS ALONG SIDE MY DISTRICT AND SEVERAL OTHERS AND SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES TO DENT DANGEROUS LEVELS OF TOXIC LEAD CONTAMINATION THE DELAY TO SHUT THIS FACILITY DOWN LEAD TO EMISSIONS FOR THE PLANT CAN. MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND. OF A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES ACROSS NUMEROUS COMMUNITIES INCLUDING BOYLE HEIGHTS IN EAST LOS ANGELES AND SOUTHEAST L. A. AB FOUR EIGHTY WILL ENABLE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. TO DIRECT THE FACILITY OR A PORTION OF THE FACILITY TO TEMPORARILY DISCONTINUE. THE OPERATIONS THAT HAVE EXPOSED OUR COMMUNITIES TO HARMFUL TOXIC MATERIALS UNTIL THAT ISSUE IS CORRECTED. AGAIN I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. OUT PARTICULARLY ADDRESSING THE DEFINITION OF IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL HERE TO TESTIFY OVER THE PHONE. R. ROYCE LONG A CUBA A PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. AND MY MARIO DRESS IDEAS WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO THE CARE. MANY MEMBERS HI GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MARA STREET EUROPE BY AND THE DIVISION CHIEF FOR THE HEALTH HAZARDOUS MATERIALS DIVISION OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT IN SUPPORT OF AB FOUR EIGHTY WE ARE THE CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCY OR COOPER AND MINISTER THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS UNIFIED PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. I SERVED AS A SUPERVISOR FOR SEVEN YEARS ON THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS SECTION AND RESPONDED TO NUMEROUS HAZARDOUS MATERIAL INCIDENTS INCLUDING THE AT LEAST- CANYON METHANE GAS LEAK. IN JUNE OF TWO. SIX I ALSO RESPONDED TO THE FRUITLAND INCIDENT. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE MAY WITH MAGNESIUM EXPLOSION AND FIRE. THIS INCIDENT INVOLVED THE METAL RECYCLER THAT HAD A SECOND UNPERMITTED BUSINESS ON SITE. THE BUSINESS WAS STRIPPING PRECIOUS METALS AND HANDLING LARGE VOLUMES OF NITRIC AND HYDROCHLORIC ACID WITHOUT A PERMIT. ONE WEEK PRIOR TO THE FIRE REACTION BURKE OCCURRED WITH INCOMPATIBLE. THE FACILITY WAS ISSUED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION BUT THE AUTHORITY TO CLOSE A PORTION OF THE FACILITY WAS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE COOPER. ALTHOUGH THE ARSON INVESTIGATION WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF IGNITION. IT HAS AFFECTED THAT THE SECOND ILLEGAL BUSINESS MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED ALL THEN THE COP WITH THE FIRE. THIS INCIDENT RESULTED IN THE EVACUATION OF OVER TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE WITH TOXIC HEAVY METAL CONTAMINATION FOUND THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. ULTIMATELY THIS RESULTED IN UPWARDS OF A THREE MILLION SUPERFUND CLEANUP PROVIDED BY THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. HAD THE AUTHORITY BEEN AVAILABLE WHICH IS BEING SOUGHT AFTER TODAY IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT THE ENTIRE INCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. I'M HERE TODAY TO URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO PASS A BEFORE EIGHTY. THIS AUTHORITY WILL ENHANCE THE GROUP'S ABILITY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY FROM RELEASES. OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. THANK YOU. VERY GOOD- THE PHONE MODERATOR COULD WE NOW HEAR FROM MR ROYCE LONG ON BEHALF OF. THE CERTIFIED UNIFIED- PROGRAM AGENCY COOPER FORUM BOARD. GOOD MORNING AND- THANK YOU CHECK WORKING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS VOICE MOM AND I'M LIKE YOU THE PROGRAM MANAGER ONE OF THE LARGEST CITIES IN THE NATION TODAY I'M TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE ON BOARD THE BOARD REPRESENTS ONE HUNDRED FIVE UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCIES STATEWIDE WITH MISSION TODAY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY.

CURRENTLY SERVICE LIKE THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO DIRECT ADMITTED ON NON COMMITTED BUSINESSES JUSTICE OPERATION MERELY WHEN THEY PASSED THE THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY THE LACK OF AUTHORITY JEOPARDIZES THE ABILITY OF SWIFTLY TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY. IT'S APPLIED TO THE EXAMPLE THAT CHEAPEST AREAS PROVIDED BY THE MAY WOULD MAKE USING HIGH SPEED TOXIC HEAVY METALS ALL OF THE DATES AND FINAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY PREVENTABLE AND TWO OTHER INCIDENTS INCLUDING COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE TAKE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY WHERE THEY HAD A VASILY REGENERATING STOP YOUR EXACT.

SO WE'VE NOW HEARD FROM SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION LET ME SAY THAT ARM I'VE HEARD WHAT THE OPPOSITION HAS TO SAY IT IS MY POSITION AND THE POSITION. OF THE- OF THIS COMMITTEE STAFF. THAT THESE TERMS WHICH THE OPPOSITION SAYS ARE NOT WELL DEFINED ARE IN FACT WELL DEFINED. YOU CAN READ- IN THE- ANALYSIS HERE THAT. EMITTED SUBSTANTIAL HAS IT. VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD LIEU THE LEGAL MEETING AND BRIEFLY READ RELEASED THRESHOLD PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE MENACE TO MINIMIZE. THAT ALSO HOUSES. I WOULD ADVISE THE OPPOSITION TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAFF. WE THINK THESE ARE TO FIND IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT ISN'T DEFINED. YOU KNOW GIVE US THE DETAILS AND WE'LL WORK WITH YOU BUT I REALLY THINK THAT THESE ARE WELL DEFINED- SO- STRENGTHENING NO. REBEKAH BAUR QUE HAN THANK YOU. AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS I THINK THE INTENT OF THIS BILL WHICH IS TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THESE EVENTS ON GOING WHEN WE KNOW THAT THERE IS. AN IMMINENT HARM TO COMMUNITY IS CRITICAL AND SO AND I WILL BE TWENTY M. L. I. TODAY I HAVE A QUESTION THOUGH FOR THE LOS ANGELES- BUT IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND IF YOU'RE STILL ON THE LINE. I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS PEACE AND IF THERE IS A CHANGE BEING MADE IN THIS BILL TWO. A RELEASE OR A SPILL. THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS RELATES TO RELEASE OUR SPELLERS THAT REQUIREMENT REMAIN THE SAME. UNDER THIS LEGISLATION. THE QUESTION A SEMESTER LONG THANK YOU. I FORGOT HIS NAME. I YEAH I CAN AT THE QUESTIONS RIGHT HERE WELL AS LONG. SO IT DOESN'T THAT SO THIS BILL IS REALLY A FUNDAMENTAL FUNDAMENTALLY SEPARATE- FROM THE THIS BILL WHILE REPORTING ISSUE AND WE'RE TRYING INTRODUCE. ITS ABILITY TO CLOSE THE FACILITY OR AN ACTIVITY IF THERE THE INTERNET AND SUBSTANTIAL DANGER TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. THAT'S THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL TO WHAT WE TRY TO GET YOU THROUGH THE BILL THE ISSUE THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW THAT YOU HAVE FROM THE OPPOSITION IS ABOUT SPECIAL QUANTITY THE LIST AND I AGREE THIS IS BEING A PROBLEM THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY MANY YEARS- ACROSS THE STATE. AND THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES IS WORKING ON SOME DROPS BILL- REPORTING REGULATIONS TO CORRECT THIS AND SO. THAT DROPPED AS BEING- DRAWFUL MANY YEARS RIGHT NOW AND WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN TO TRY AND GET THAT ALONG BUT- THAT WILL ADDRESS THE. THRESHOLD REPORTING QUALITY. THANK YOU MISTER. TIME AND I APOLOGIZE AGAIN FOR FORGETTING YOUR NAME- I THINK THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL I THAT YOU ACTUALLY OPENED OUR STATEMENTS MISTER LONG SPEAKING ABOUT THE VAST ARRAY OF ENTITIES THAT ARE REGULATED UNDER THIS AND SOME OF THEM ARE THESE LARGE FACILITIES. THAT BECAUSE HUMONGOUS DAMAGED OUR COMMUNITIES ONLY THE SPELLS AND I KNOW THAT'S VERY MUCH WHAT AND MISS CARILLO IS FOCUSED ON BUT WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT AT TIMES VERY SMALL RETAILERS TO DROP TO MINIMUS AMOUNTS OF CHEMICALS THAT ALL OF US HAVE IN OUR HOMES- AND SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE PAY ATTENTION TO SORT OF. THE VARYING I'M TYPES OF ENTITIES THAT ARE BEING REGULATED HERE ENSURE WE'RE NOT- PUTTING BURDENSOME REGULATIONS ON THOSE WHEN THERE ISN'T NECESSARILY A PUBLIC BENEFIT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. MISTER MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO DIRECT MY QUESTION TO MR LONG THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY COOPER REPRESENTATIVE- AS A SOME OF THOSE GUYS KNOW- I HAVE AN ISSUE IN MY DISTRICT A LONGSTANDING GOOD A CONCERN WITH THE TORRANCE REFINERY USING A HIGHLY TOXIC CHEMICAL MODIFIED HYDROFLUORIC ACID I WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY COOPER REPRESENTATIVE- I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU CAN CONFIRM THAT THIS WOULD- IF THERE WAS A- IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL THREAT OF HARM TO THE PUBLIC- IN IN MY DISTRICT AS A RESULT OF THE RELEASE OF THE MODIFIED HYDROCHLORIC ACID THAT THIS BILL WOULD GIVE THE AUTHORITY TO SHUT DOWN A PORTION. OF OR THE ENTIRE REFINERY- TO ADDRESS- THIS THREAT. MURATSUCHI THIS IS MARIO FIGURA DIVISION KEEP THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT IN FACT I DID RESPOND- TO THE TORRANCE REFINERY RELEASED- MANY YEARS AGO THERE ARE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN I BELIEVE. AND AGAIN WE'VE BEEN WORKING JOINTLY TO REGARDING ANY RELEASES THAT IMPACT THE COMMUNITY WITH REGARDS TO EIGHTY SIXTEEN FORTY SIX IMPROPER NOTIFICATION IT'S HARD TO CROSS JURISDICTIONAL NOTIFICATION AS WELL BUT TO BE CLEAR AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTION YES THIS WOULD PROVIDE THE AUTHORITY THAT IN THE EVENT OF A RELEASE- THAT IMPACT THE COMMUNITY NOTIFICATION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BUT THERE FOR HAVING THE AUTHORITY. TO ADDRESS THE MAJOR ISSUES AT A FACILITY TO ENSURE THAT IT IS SHUT DOWN UNTIL INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED BOB THIS IS WHERE THIS. AUTHORIZATION WOULD PROVIDE US. THANKS FOR THE CALL. ALL I'M ASH A- THIS. IS SURPRISE TO THE- LEARN THAT. YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE THAT AUTHORITY TO SHUT DOWN. YOU KNOW THE REFINERY FOR SUCH A- A THREAT TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. IT IS THAT IS OUT OF ORDER TO SHUT DOWN THE REFINERY CURRENTLY NONEXISTENT. THERE IS A LOT OF ISSUES THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS AND THIS WOULD CLARIFY THAT AUTHORITY- I'M ON THE COOPER SIDE WE HAVE A FIRE PREVENTION SIDE DEPENDING UPON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT COULD OCCUR THERE. THAT THE FIRE PREVENTION SO I COULD READ TAG SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT AT THAT POINT IN ESSENCE YOU KNOW ADDRESSING THE ISSUE THERE AS WELL. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MS CARDIO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. A ONCE AGAIN BRING IN THIS THIS BILL FOR. I DON'T WANT TO BE A- AS PRESUMPTUOUS TO- YOU KNOW TO- SIGN ON AS A JOINT AUTHORS GIVEN THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING SO HARD ON THIS BILL. BUT IF YOU'RE NICE ENOUGH TO CONSIDER ME TO BE A JOINT AUTHORS ON THIS BILL. FOR IF NOT A CO AUTHOR. I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. VERY GOOD ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS. HUH MISTER MATHIS NO SURPRISE RECKLESS RETIREMENT OF COURSE OKAY I ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS TO. MISS CARRILLO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS ON THIS I KNOW IT'S BEEN YEARS I KNOW CO IT'S MATH A LOT OF THE SOFT- I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE I'D BE WILLING TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU AND- THE OPPOSITION TO TRY TO HELP. FIND THAT. THAT LAST LITTLE BIT TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS SO I'M WILLING TO GO GO OUT WITH YOU ON THAT WOMEN AND HELPED BROKER THAT PIECE- BUT WE NEED TO GET THERE ONCE WE GET THERE I'D BE HAPPY TO JOIN AUTHOR OF THIS WITH YOU. BUT AT THIS TIME OF THAT AWAY OFF. THANK YOU A VERY GOOD- ANYONE ELSE. ALL RIGHT ARM THEN. YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SUMMER C. TO YOUR MORE THAN WELCOME TO COME ON TO THE LEGISLATION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS I KNOW HOW HARD YOU'VE WORKED AND ISSUES REGARDING THE REFINERIES IN YOUR DISTRICT AND I KNOW THAT ALL OF US HERE CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT CARE ABOUT THE WORKERS THAT WORK AT THESE FACILITIES CARE ABOUT THE HEALTH AND IMPACT TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. CARE ABOUT ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A STRONG ECONOMY WITH INDUSTRIES THAT THRIVE- THAT IS NOT THE ONLY REASON WHY WE'RE HERE OUR JOB IS ALSO TO PROTECT AND ENSURE COMMUNITIES HAVE THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE WHEN THERE IS A SPILL OR HAZARDOUS WASTE MATERIALS THAT ARE IMPACTING THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WE KNOW THERE'S A USC STUDY THAT CAME OUT JUST A FEW YEARS AGO WORD THAT THE BABY TEETH OF CHILDREN AND MY DISTRICT ALONG SIDE SOUTHEAST L. A. IN NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES WERE TESTED. TO HAVE LEAD IN THEM BABY TEETH BECAUSE THAT IS THE LEVEL OF THREAT THAT MY COMMUNITY AND SEVERAL OTHERS HAVE FACED DUE TO LEAD CONTAMINATION I HAVE BEEN WORKING SINCE I GOT HERE TO THE LEGISLATURE AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED BEING THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS BILL WITH THE OPPOSITION AND I'M GLAD THAT THEY'RE ON THE PHONE AND I'M GLAD THAT THEY'VE SHARED THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT EVERY TIME THAT THEY PRESENT- A PROBLEM. WE'VE TRIED TO ADDRESS IT AND THEN THEY PRESENT A NEW PROBLEM AND A NEW PROBLEM AND A NEW PROBLEM UNTIL WE DON'T GET IT DONE. AND SO MISTER MATHIS. IF YOU ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH ME IN THE OPPOSITION TO ENSURE THAT WE GET TO A FINAL STOP. NO MORE AMENDMENTS. NO MORE PROBLEMS. NO MORE ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO BRING TO THE TABLE TO CHANGE THE BILL AND STOP THE BILL OR HOLD THE BILL. THEN LET'S DO IT. BUT THIS CONTINUING CHANGING OF THE GOAL POST. IS NOT HOW WE OPERATE IN GOOD FAITH. SO I AM MORE THAN WILLING I THINK I'VE SHOWN AND DEMONSTRATED THAT I'M MORE THAN WILLING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO GET TO A GOOD PLACE TO UNDERSTAND. THEIR CONCERNS WELL THEY ALSO UNDERSTAND. OUR CONCERNS BECAUSE GUESS WHAT. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE FOLKS AND FOLKS THAT HAVE CANCER IN MY COMMUNITY AND FOLKS THAT. HAVE BABIES WITH. AT THE B. TEETH WITH LETTING THEM THEY DON'T HAVE LOBBYIST UP HERE. THEY HAVE ME. THEY HAVE ALL OF YOU. AND IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE. THAT THESE AGENCIES AND THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES ON THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS. THAT HAVE TESTIFIED TODAY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE TO DO THEIR JOB THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN. FIGHTING FOR THIS. CASH FOR THREE YEARS NOW. TRYING TO GET TO A GOOD PLACE. AND I HOPE THAT WE GET THERE. BUT WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS THAT CONTINUE TO CHANGE THE GOAL POSTS AND NOTHING GETS DONE. SO THIS IS A COMMONSENSE pABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IT'S ABOUT DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR COMMUNITIES THAT WILL A NEIGHBOR A LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ACT. IN THE INTEREST OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND BETTER PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES HEALTH AND SAFETY. WHILE COORDINATING WITH THE PROPER AGENCIES AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I AND I VOTE. AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE THIS ALONG THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ELEGANT QUOTE CLOSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I'M A COUPLE OF THINGS HERE FIRST OF ALL IT'S ODD TO ME THAT THE OPPOSITION DIDN'T MENTION SOMETHING THAT'S IN OUR ANALYSIS. UP WHICH IS THAT WE THINK IT WOULD BE BEST IF YOU- MADE THE APPEALS PROCESS- MORE CLEAR. SO IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T THINK THAT THIS IS- AND- HE- IMMINENT- THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO APPEAL WILL YOU BE WORKING ON THAT YES ABSOLUTELY. ALL RIGHT. WE REALLY THINK. THAT THIS TO MINIMIZE QUESTION WHAT THE THRESHOLD MEANS IS WELL RESOLVED BY THE BILL THE BILL STILL LEAKS DEAR CLEARLY STATES AS I READ FROM THE ANALYSIS THE COOPER AND CONSULTANT IN CONSULTATION WITH A LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER MOST RECENTLY DETERMINED THAT TE RELEASE BILL ESCAPE OR ENTRY POSES AN IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL ENDANGERMENT TO PUBLIC HEALTH. NOTE IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL. AND THE TERM REASONABLE MEANS HAVING SOUND JUDGMENT TO BE FAIR SENSIBLE INJUDICIOUS THIS TERM REASONABLE IS USED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA LAW AND IS WIDELY UNDERSTOOD. IF BOTH THE COOPER AND A LOCAL HEALTH OFFICE SHOULD DETERMINE A RELEASE OR SPELL THIS IS A THRESHOLD THAT THE BUSINESS OWNER FEELS IS NOT REASONABLE. THEN THEN THEIR SH WE WILL HAVE A- AN APPEALS PROCESS DETERMINED- WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THE BUSINESS OWNER. I THINK THAT THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION A BITMAP THAT WE'RE CERTAINLY WILLING AS AS COMMITTEE STAFF AND COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM- AND- WHEN I HAVE- AGREEMENT. FROM- DON'T KEPT THE ON OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC BALANCE. AND MARGO'S PARKS ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN% STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION- TO AGREE TO THESE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US ON THESE ISSUES. ARE YOU STILL ON THE IF YOU'RE STILL ON THE LINE COULD WE HEAR. YES LIFTED THAT MARGOT PARKS WITH LET YOU THINK TRYING TO DEDICATION ABSOLUTELY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ADAM AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENCOURAGEMENT AND THE POLLUTION HONESTLY THINK SHE THAT. YEAH THANK YOU FOR YOUR STAFF BOB ALL RIGHT SO PLEASE. DONT HAPPY EVER AFTER THAT THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH LOOKED IT. WE THINK THAT THINGS HAVE BEEN DEFINED. PLEASE IF YOU DON'T THINK SO GIVE US SOMETHING SUBSTANTIAL THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THAT'S WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THESE HAVE BEEN DONE. SO WITH THAT. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE ITEM NUMBER THREE EIGHTY FOUR EIGHTY CARILLO THE MOTION IS DUE PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS QUIRK HI CORP HI SMITH I WILL BE UNKNOWN UNTIL CONSIDER OF. AMENDMENTS THANK YOU SMITH NO ARAMBULA. OUR QUE HAN. OUR QUE HAN HI DALLY. CRISTINA GARCIA. GARCIA I HOLDEN HOLDEN HI MATHIS. NOT VOTING MATHIS NOT VOTING WITH A TO G. WHEN I TO XII. THAT HAS FIVE VOTES NEEDED TO PASS UP OKAY SO THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH EVERYONE ON THIS THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. WE WILL. ALL RIGHT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN SPILL HAS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. WE'RE HEARING A. B. R. SIX FIVE TWO. ALEX SAFETY JUVENILE PRODUCTS CHEMICALS- MMHM. PERFLUOROALKYL AND POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- THIS IS A BILL ABOUT P. FOSS WHICH IS USED UNFORTUNATELY IN A LOT OF CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT SOMETIMES IN THE LEGISLATURE WE FIND THINGS OUT. ABOUT OUR OWN LIVES THAT ARE DISTRESSING AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME IN THIS CASE AS THE MOM OF A SEVEN YEAR OLD I HAD NO IDEA. THAT FOR HER ENTIRE LIFE. I PROBABLY BEEN PUTTING HER IN BE IN CHILDREN'S CLOTHING AND BABY CLOTHING PUTTING HER ON CHANGING MATS. THAT WERE CONTAMINATED WITH A KNOWN CARCINOGENIC MATERIAL P. FOSS. FOR NO GOOD REASON. THERE'S NO REASON AT ALL THAT THESE MATERIALS TO BE USED. I BELIEVE ANYWHERE BUT CERTAINLY NOT IN CHILDREN'S CLOTHING. AND CHILDREN'S TOYS. THIS BILL WOULD FOLLOW THE LEAD TAKEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOMS BILL FROM A FEW YEARS AGO ABOUT FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS USED IN CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS. AND SAY THAT IN CALIFORNIA. WE REALLY WANT OUR CONSTITUENTS KNOW THAT IF THEY'RE BUYING BABY PRODUCTS IN CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE DONE OUR BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. THOSE ITEMS ARE FREE OF CANCER CAUSING ADDITIVES. NOW ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT I DO WANT TO BRING UP WITH THE P. FOSSE'S THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN AWARE OF BESIDES THE FACT THAT THEY ARE NOW BEING DETECTED IN HUMAN BLOOD. AND THAT WE KNOW THAT THEIR ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS AND CARCINOGENIC I THAT IT'S ALSO BEING FOUND WHEN LARGE AMOUNTS IN WATER. I HAD A MEETING JUST YESTERDAY WITH METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT TO SAYING THAT THEIR BIGGEST CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS NOT DROUGHT. THEIR BIGGEST CONCERN IS THE AMOUNT OF CONTAMINANTS OF EMERGING CONTAMINANTS THEY'RE FINDING IN THE WATER. OTHER MANUFACTURERS IN THE OPPOSITION'S. MAY COME ON TODAY. AND TALK TO ABOUT. HOW IMPORTANT THESE CHEMICALS ARE NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THEY'RE GONNA SAY. BUT I WOULD LOVE FOR SOMEONE TO ASK THEM AS THE ONES WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE. FOR POLLUTING OUR WATER WITH THESE MATERIALS HOW MUCH THEY'RE GOING TO PAY. OUR WATER DISTRICTS. SO THAT OUR RATE PAYERS DON'T HAVE TO PAY TO CLEAN THESE CHEMICALS OUT OF WATER. WHICH ALSO WERE LEACHING OUT OF THE SAME CLOTHING. THROUGH WHEN WE WASH OUR- OUR CLOTHING WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE COMING OFF IN THE FIBERS. AND GETTING INTO OUR GROUNDWATER AND OUR WATER SUPPLY. SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. OH AND ONE OTHER THING I WANT TO MENTION. WE ARE WILLING TO. AMEND THE BILL AS WE MOVE FORWARD SO THAT IT'S NARROWED DOWN TO MATERIALS THAT DON'T INCLUDE ELECTRONICS. AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES. VERY GOOD. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT NEXT TO- WE HAVE SOME WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IN THE WITNESS VIDEO CONFERENCE ROOM SO CAN WE HAVE THAT TO TURN TO ON. AND THEN WE'LL HEAR FROM BILL L. A. R. D. OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP. MAY TAKE A MINUTE TO GET EXTRA OKAY GO AHEAD. MMHM YEAH JUST START SPEAKING. DOCTOR RANDY SHOULD BE ON THE PHONE- YES BUT WHERE YOU AT WE FIRST WANT TO HEAR FROM DEL- ALLEY ART. L. OKAY I'M FILL OUT LEO- GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR ENVIRONMENT WORKING GROUP IN CALIFORNIA. I'M GONNA DRESS OF THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENTS AND DR DAVID ANDREWS WILL BE ADDRESSING THE STOCK. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK. THE CLAIM THAT PEACE AS CHEMICALS THE ADDRESSED INDIVIDUALLY HAS ALREADY BEEN JUST THE DECIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCE HOLES AND THEY'RE WORKING PAID ON P. FAST DIFFERENT CONCERT AUTOX. IF IT IS SIX EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY TWO BAND FOR EXAMPLE FIVE INDIVIDUAL FORMS OF P. THOUSAND JUVENILE PRODUCTS THE INDUSTRY WOULD SIMPLY CREATE FIVE MORE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE CHEMICALS TO PUT ON THEIR PRODUCTS. THE OPPOSITION IS RAISED CONCERNED ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF JUVENILE PRODUCTS BUT AS THE AUTHOR ACKNOWLEDGING YOUR STATEMENT WE ARE EMINENTLY PREPARED TO APPROPRIATELY NARROW THAT DEFINITION. THE OPPONENTS SAY THE EIGHTY SIX FIFTY TWO IS NOT NEEDED BECAUSE PTSD SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM WILL GET TO THESE PRODUCTS SOONER THAN LATER AND ALSO THIS SENATOR ALLEN HAS INTRODUCED SB FIVE OH TWO. WHICH HAS SOME FEATURES MEANT TO MAKE THE PROGRAM MORE EFFICIENT THREE THINGS SB FIVE OH TWO IS AN IMPORTANT BILL BUT IT'S NOT A SILVER BULLET THAT FIXES ALL THE PROGRAMS ISSUES OF TIMELINESS. AND THAT BILL MAY NOT EVEN MAKE IT TO THE GOVERNOR FOR SIGNATURE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY ALTHOUGH DGSE RECENTLY INCLUDED CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS IN A DRAFT WORK PLAN. THEY WILL NOT NECESSARILY ADOPT THAT CATEGORY INTO A FINAL WORK PLAN AND EVEN IF THEY DO. THE PUBLIC IN THIS LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKELY WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT DECADE TO SEE ANY ACTION. LASTLY THE OPPONENTS RAISE THE SPECTER OF INCREASED THIRD PARTY LAWSUITS IF THIS BILL BECAME LAW I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE VERY OPPONENTS OF AB SIX FIFTY TWO SUPPORTED PROP SIXTY FOUR. BACK IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHICH PUT A MAJOR CHILLING EFFECT ON THIRD PARTY LAWSUITS THE MAIN PROVISION OF THAT LAW PROHIBITS ANY PERSON OTHER THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND LOCAL PUBLIC PROSECUTORS. FROM BRINGING A LAWSUIT FOR UNFAIR COMPETITION UNLESS THAT PERSON HAS PERSONALLY SUFFERED INJURY AND LOST MONEY OR PROPERTY THIS HIGH HURDLE HAS WORKED FOR THE INTENT OF THOSE WHO BROUGHT THE MEASURE TO THE BALLOT IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR. IN CONCLUSION WE CANNOT WAIT FOR DTS THE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM BY PASSING EIGHTY SIX FIFTY TWO NOW OUR CHILDREN WILL HAVE LESS HEALTH. IMPACTS DOWN THE ROAD THANK YOU. VERY GOOD THANK YOU- MISTER ANDREWS- YOU'RE ON THE PHONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU CHECK WHERE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL. MY NAME IS DAVID ANDREWS A SENIOR SCIENTIST AT ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP AND I HAVE A PHD IN CHEMISTRY. I HAVE PUBLISHED NUMEROUS REPORTS AND WORKED ON PER AND POLY FLORAL ALQUILER P. FIVE CONTAMINATION THAT. HAVE ALSO BEEN A CO AUTHOR ON FIVE PEER REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS REGARDING P. FOUGHT THE CURRENT. AND HEALTH RISKS. CONTAMINATION FROM Q. FIVE IS THE NATIONAL PUBLIC AN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. EMERGENCY AND URGENT ACTION IS NEEDED TO REDUCE. AND ELIMINATE EXPOSURE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. RESEARCH STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT HUMANS BOTH ADULTS AND CHILDREN ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO NUMEROUS HARMS FROM EXPOSURE TO BE FIVE. CHILDREN ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO KEEP OFF IMPACTS TO THE IMMUNE SYSTEM INCLUDING THE REDUCED EFFECTIVENESS OF VACCINES AND HARM DURING CRITICAL PERIODS OF DEVELOPMENT. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM HAS ALREADY CONFIRMED THAT P. FIVE ARE A THREAT TO HEALTH. DETERMINES THAT P. FIVE SHOULD BE REGULATED AS AN ENTIRE CLASS NOT JUST CHEMICAL BY CHEMICAL THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS SUGGESTED. THIS INCLUDES THE FLOOR PALMER IN THE SHORT CHAIN REPLACEMENT CHEMICALS THAT NUMBER IN THE HUNDREDS TO THOUSANDS. IT IS BECAUSE OF THE URGENT HEALTH PRIORITY OF PROTECTING CHILDREN THAT HE WG IS PROUD TO SPONSOR EIGHTY SIX FIFTY TWO. HELLO ELIMINATE THE UNNECESSARY AND POTENTIALLY HARMFUL USE OF P. FIVE IN CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS. THESE PRODUCTS LEAD TO EXPOSURE TO CONTACT WITH THE SKIN AND INHALATION OF DUST. GIVE US A CALL FOREVER CHEMICALS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT BREAK APART IN THE ENVIRONMENT OR IN PEOPLE EITHER NOT CHEMICALS THAT BELONG IN OUR CHILDREN. MANY PEOPLE ACCUMULATE IN BLOOD. IS CHEMICAL THEY'RE DETECTED IN NEARLY EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE COUNTRY. INCLUDING INCENSE PASSING EIGHTY SIX FIFTY TWO IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD. IN REDUCING UNNECESSARY EXPOSURE. TO CHILDREN AND INFANTS AND WOULD PUT CALIFORNIA IN THE LEAD UP PROTECTING OUR CHILDREN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR BOTH AUTHORS- FOR KEEPING TO THETIME PERIODS FOR CHEESE ME BOTH WITNESSES- FOR IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM WHO WISHES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS RARE. THIS BILL. AND THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE- ANYONE IN THE VIDEO CONFERENCE ROOM IF SO SPEAK UP NOW. THERE BE NONE ARE WE THEN WE'LL HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION- WE DO HAVE SOMEONE SPEAKING REMOTELY THANK YOU. PLEASE GO AHEAD MISS LITTLE. THANK YOU- ADDITIONAL SUPPORTERS OF EIGHT SB **** AB SIX FIFTY TO INCLUDE BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS IN STRONG SUPPORT THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS DISTRICT NINE THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES COUNTY SANITATION DISTRICTS CALPERS. CLEAN WATER ACTION PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY SAN FRANCISCO THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS CALIFORNIA. THE CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL. SHE IS WITH THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION OF CALIFORNIA AND ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. VERY GOOD THANK YOU MISS LITTLE. I HAVE THAT WHAT IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WISHES TO SPEAK REMOTELY TO THE TO THE VIDEO. YES NOW OKAY THEN WHERE ARE WE NOW GOING TO HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION. IN ORDER TO WITNESSES FIRST I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM- TIM CHAU STACK ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL- PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING DOCTOR CORE. OKAY YEAH. THANK YOU- SHERMAN NUMBERS WITH MANY I THINK I THINK WITH THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY AND- SAY I DO APPRECIATE- THE COMMENTS BY PHONE THREE MAN AND HIS FATHER WHO THE BILL YOU. THE KIND OF WORK ON I EIGHT MORE NARROWING THE DEFINITION OF AROUND A GIVEN OUR PRODUCT- AS WE HAVE STATED THERE ARE. SOME VERY- WIDESPREAD USES OF SOME OF THESE- CHEMISTRY THEY DO PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS SMARTPHONES TABLETS MEDICAL DEVICES. PACKAGING FOR PHARMACEUTICALS SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT A MORE CLEARLY DEFINED DEFINITION OF JUVENILE PRODUCTS WOULD BE IMPORTANT I WILL BE IMPORTANT TO AVOID A POTENTIAL. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. WELL I DO WANT TO ALSO MAKE A QUICK COMMENT. ABOUT PTSD PROGRAM- YEAH THAT WAS MENTIONED BY MISTER ALLEY- THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS IDENTIFIED CHILDREN PRODUCT AS PART OF IT UPDATED. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE WORKPLAN- SENATE ALLEN ALSO IS MOVING SB FIVE OH TO A BILL THAT NEARLY ACROSS THE FINISH LINE LAST THAT CAN- THAT WILL PROVIDE THE NEW TOOLS YOU. FOR THE APARTMENT THE VICTIM IDENTIFIED ADDRESS THEM UNSAFE CHEMICAL INGREDIENTS IN EVERYDAY PRODUCTS. FRANKLY WE DO BELIEVE THAT THAT VENUE DOES PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT ISSUES AROUND SCOPE IMPACTED PRODUCTS- AND ANY POTENTIAL FUND AND IT CAN IMPACT. FUTURE THAT THOSE ARE PROPERLY DRAFT SO I JUST DON'T REPORT- WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. WITH THE US SPONSORED- AND THE AUTHORED THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED FINDING IT PROCEEDS AFTER. YOU PASS BY TODAY THANK YOU. VERY GOOD WE WILL NOW HEAR FROM MR J. WEST ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL AS WELL- IS A DOCTOR WEST. PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU CHAIR COURT CAN YOU HEAR ME YEAH YEAH. GREAT SO THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO AB SIXTY SIX FIFTY TWO ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL'S PERFORMANCE FLUORO POLYMER PARTNERSHIP- WE OPPOSE THE BILL BECAUSE IT OVERLY BROAD DEFINITIONS OF P. HAPPENED YOU'RE GONNA PRODUCTS. ON PIZZA- AS YOU HAVE HEARD FROM THE- SPONSORS THE BILL WOULD TREAT ALL PEOPLE AFTER THE SINGLE SUBSTANCE WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY A LARGE DIVERSE GROUP OF COMPOUND. THAT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL COUNCIL THE STATE ABOUT. PROMOTE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION AND A RECENT WORKSHOP CONVENED BY THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES- FLOOR. SPECIFICALLY ARE SUB CLASS OF P. FACT THAT ARE LARGE STABLE INSIDE THE MALL KILLS AND THEY DON'T RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT DEGRADATION AND MOVEMENT. BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL MEDIA LIKE SOME OF THE- SMALLER LEGACY CHEMICALS. THEY ARE NEITHER BIOAVAILABLE NOR VAIO CUMULATIVE AND THEY ARE NOT P. FOLLOW UP OR P. FOX AND THEY DO NOT TRANSFORM INTO PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE THE ENVIRONMENT. ON HUMAN PRODUCTS THE BILL WOULD BE PDF MEDICAL. THAT INCLUDE CLOCKS POLYMERS AND ARE ALREADY APPROVED BY FDA WHEN IN FACT FLUOROPOLYMERS HAVE BEEN USED SAFELY IN MEDICAL DEVICES FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. THEY ARE PART OF OUR QUALITIES LIKE LIKE THAT THE LAST COULD BE INSTABILITY AND THEY'RE EXTREMELY LOW CHEMICAL REACTIVITY REDUCES THE BODY'S REACTION TO REJECT FOREIGN MATERIALS. THEY ALSO HELP PREVENT MICROORGANISMS FROM COLONIZING SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS STENTS CATHETERS MEDICAL FILTERS INTO BEING WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO INFECTIONS AND OTHER COMPLICATIONS- ALSO THE BILL WOULD BAN MANY JUVENILE ON A TONIC DEVICES WITH INSULATED WIRES PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS OR TOUCH SCREENS THINGS LIKE A CHILD'S LEARNING TOY A BABY MONITOR. A READING TABLET OR HANDHELD GAMING DEVICE- THERE USED IN THOSE DEVICES BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGHLY RESISTANT TO TEMPERATURE AND HAVE SUPERIOR OF LEXICAL PROPERTIES. AND TIME IS- UP TO PREVENT DAMAGE FROM MOISTURE. OKAY YOUR TIME IS UP AND YOU KNOW YOU REALLY HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE TESTIMONY YOU JUST CAN'T COME WITH A- SOMETHING YOU'VE MADE UP AHEAD OF TIME AND READ IT LISTEN TO THE TESTIMONY. THESE YOU SPENT TWO MINUTES TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT THE OFFER IS ALREADY CONCEDED ON. I'VE HEARD ENOUGH AND YOU DID GO TO YOUR TWO MINUTES. BUT PLEASE LISTEN TO MY APOLOGIES- I WAS I WAS READING FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS BUT I DIDN'T MEAN TO WHAT. TIME THE AUTHOR. THAT THEY WERE NOT INCLUDED THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HEARD THIS YOU COULD HAVE AT LEAST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY WERE ALREADY EXCLUDED AND LEFT IT THERE AND GIVE US SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL. THANK YOU NOW- IS FAR AS THE DISCUSSION ABOUT- THE TSC AND GREEN CHEMISTRY TAKING THIS ON. THIS ISSUE FIRST CAME TO THE COMMITTEE FOR YEARS AGO THERE'S BEEN NO PROGRESS CENTS FOR YEARS IS FOUR YEARS TOO LONG. SECOND THE TSC SAID HAS SAID THAT ALL OF THESE CHEMICALS THAT WE TALK ABOUT THAT WOULD BE IN JUVENILE PRODUCTS. SHOULD BE TREATED AS A CLASS THAT'S SOMETHING WE DIDN'T KNOW FOUR YEARS AGO THERE WAS A BIG DISCUSSION ABOUT THE VARIOUS TYPES AND SHOULD THEY BE CONSIDERED DIFFERENTLY. THERE WAS NOT A CONSENSUS ON THAT THAT CONSENSUS HAS BEEN REACHED THEY SHOULD BE TREATED AS A CLASS. ALL RIGHT. ANY QUESTIONS. YES- CRISTINA GARCIA THANK YOU ADD JUST A SHORT COMMENT- WHEN I THINK THE UP THERE FOR WORKING ON THIS- ON THE P. FAST IN THE CLASS ISSUE WE KNOW THAT IS THE FIRST CHANGE BEHAVE MUCH LIKE THE LONG TEAMS AS THEY BREAK DOWN- AND SO WHEN WE DID AB SEVEN FIFTY SIX I WAS THERE TO TAKE THAT STEP FORWARD TO CALL THESE OF THE CLASS AND I THINK THE LESSON HERE IS THAT MY MOM WE DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING THAT IN THE FUTURE WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE PROBLEMS AND SO WE SHOULD BE PROACTIVE AND SELF. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL. MATAMATA REBEKKA BAY REFACTOR BAUER K. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR HOME FOR THE BILL LIKE YOU OF MANY OF THE THINGS I FIND OUT IN THIS COMMITTEE SPECIFICALLY MAKE ME VERY FREAKED OUT OF THE MOTHER THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH WE CAN DO SO THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO HELP AND I GUESS THAT'S US. SO I APPRECIATE THIS I. I'VE I APPRECIATE A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS. YEAH I STARTED ON THIS COMMITTEE TWO YEARS AGO REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE GREEN CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT AND THEIR WORK YOU KNOW I. WE ALSO AS PARENTS ABOUT EVERYTHING WITHOUT BPA BECAUSE WE KNEW BPA WAS BAD AND THEN WE LEARN. THE PS IS JUST AS BAD AND IT TURNS OUT WE'VE BEEN LETTING THEIR KIDS USE THAT. SO THERE IS I MEAN THE GREEN CHEMISTRY DIVISION IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN ENSURING WE DON'T MAKE THOSE MISTAKES OF CREATING ORE DANGEROUS ALTERNATIVES. BUT TO THE CHAIRS POINTS. THE GREEN CHEMISTRY DIVISION HAS BEEN AROUND FOR OVER A DECADE. AND BAD AND MADE THREE ROLES. RURAL SO CLEARLYTHEY'RE NOT MOVING FAST ENOUGH AND IT'S OUR OBLIGATION TO PROTECT. CALIFORNIANS WHERE THEY ARE FAILING SO WE STARTED OUR DAY WORKING ON DTS YOU'RE GOING TO GET THERE BUT FOR NOW I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK.

WELL THE QUESTION IS A CLOSE NOW THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL I ALSO LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA FOR A JOINT AUTHORS THIS IMPORTANT BILL- THIS BILL ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN SIX TWO SIX FOR TECH STUDENTS FROM AIR POLLUTION AND DANGEROUS CHEMICALS IN YOUR SCHOOLS NO MATTER WHAT SCHOOL THEY GO TO PRIVATE PUBLIC OR CHARTER EIGHTY SEVEN SIX TWO REQUIRES PRIVATE CHARTER SCHOOLS TO MEET THE SAME SAFETY REQUIREMENTS AS PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHEN CHOOSING A NEW SCHOOL SITE. IN MY DISTRICT A PRIVATE SCHOOL CALLED STRATFORD SCHOOL WAS BUILT RIGHT NEXT TO A CEMENT FACTORY WITHIN FEET OF A PLAYGROUND IS LATELY CEMENT PILES I DON'T RECALL THEM BUT IN MY DISTRICT A PART OF THE PROCESS OF MAKING CONCRETE TO PUT CHEMICALS INTO THE AIR AND THE CHILDREN ARE SPECIALLY ESPECIALLY AT RISK FOR HEALTH PROBLEMS I'M THANKFUL FOR THE SUPPORT AND ADVOCACY OF PARENTS FOR MY DISTRICT. WHO SHOULD BE ON THE LINE TODAY INCLUDING A SHENG DIED WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE ATTENDED SHEPHERD SCHOOL AND WILL BE CALLING AND HOPEFULLY TO SUPPORT AND SHOULD OF STORIES ASSEMBLY THIS ISN'T THE ONLY EXAMPLE IN SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES COUNTY THERE ARE PLANS TO BUILD A CHARTER SCHOOL IN A PSYCH CONTAINING LEAD AND ARSENIC STUDENTS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PUT THEIR HEALTH AT RISK BY GOING TO CLASS SIMPLY. AB SEVEN SIX TWO WILL ENSURE THAT POTENTIAL HAZARDS AND SOURCES OF POLLUTION YOUR PRIVATE AND CHARTER SCHOOLS SITES OR DEFIED INVESTIGATED SO THAT SCHOOLS CAN BE BUILT IN SAFE LOCATIONS I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE CALIFORNIA SURF YOUR PRIDE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PRIVATE SCHOOL ORGANIZATIONS FOR CALLING THIS BILL A SENSIBLE REASONABLE AND PRACTICABLE MEASURE SO VERY NICE. I THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. HELLO IT'S AN I WILL BE HAVE. ALLEN ABS FROM THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AS OUR TESTIMONY SUPPORT ALL RIGHT SO THIS WITNESSES IN THE VIDEO CONFERENCING ROOM- ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS START SPEAKING AND THE SYSTEM WILL COME ON. MISTER WORKING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS ALAN ABSENT THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICER WITH THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT WHICH WORKS TO PROVIDE A HEALTHIER ENVIRONMENT TO NEARLY EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE IN THE NINE COUNTY BAY AREA REGION. THE BAY AREA AT&amp;T IS A PROUD SPONSOR OF AB SEVEN SIXTY TWO AND WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER EARLY FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT BILL TO PROTECT CHILDREN'S HEALTH. IN CURRENT LAW PRIOR TO CONSTRUCTING A NEW PUBLIC SCHOOL OR PUBLICLY FUNDED CHARTER SCHOOL SCHOOL AUTHORITIES ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM SEVERAL ACTS OF DUE DILIGENCE TO BETTER ENSURE THE HEALTH OF THEIR FUTURE STUDENTS AND SCHOOL STAFF. THEY DETERMINE THAT THE PROPERTY TO BE BUILT UPON IS NOT A FORMER. A CURRENT OR FORMER HAZARDOUS WASTE SITE OR HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES RELEASE SITE. AND THEY CONSULT WITH STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES AND MAKE A FINDING THAT THE HEALTH RISKS OR OTHER POLLUTION SOURCES DO NOT AND WILL NOT CONSTITUTE. AN ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL ENDANGERMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO PERSONS WHO WOULD ATTEND OR BE EMPLOYED AT THE SCHOOL. THIS INCLUDES WORKING WITH THE LOCAL AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT OR AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT TO IDENTIFY BOTH PERMITTED AND NON PERMITTED FACILITIES WITHIN THAT DISTRICTS AUTHORITY. INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FREEWAYS AND OTHER BUSY TRAFFIC CORRIDORS LARGE AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS AND RAILYARDS WITHIN ONE FOURTH OF A MILE OF THE PROPOSED SCHOOL SITE. THAT MIGHT REASONABLY BE ANTICIPATED TO ADMIT HAZARDOUS AIR EMISSIONS. THIS IS A REQUIREMENT THAT DOES NOT CURRENTLY APPLY TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND SOME CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND WHILE WE ARE NOT CLAIMING THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF THE SCHOOLS ARE POORLY CITED. INCREASING LAND USE DENSITY AND RE PURPOSING INFILL SITES RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT WITHOUT SIMILAR DUE DILIGENCE. FUTURE SCHOOLS MAY BE CONSTRUCTED IN THE VICINITY OF POLLUTION SOURCES THAT UNNECESSARILY EXPOSE CHILDREN. IN SCHOOL EMPLOYEES AND CREATE AN UNHEALTHY WORK ENVIRONMENT. EIGHTY SEVEN SIXTY TWO REQUIRES THE SCHOOL AUTHORITIES TO ASSESS THE HAZARDOUS WASTE AND AIR POLLUTION CONDITIONS. ON AND IN THE VICINITY OF THE PROPOSED SCHOOL. TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS INFORMATION AND IF NECESSARY TO USE IT IN THEIR DECISION MAKING PROCESS WHEN CONSTRUCTING THEIR SCHOOL. ON THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT I AGAIN THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEAVE FOR OFFERING THIS BILL. AND I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU. VERY GOOD THANK YOU- SO WE- IS THERE ANYONE ELSE ARE ON VIDEO COM IN THE VIDEO CONFERENCE AREA WHO WISHES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.

MCDONALD'S AND CHIPOTLE HAVE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT HOW TO PHASE OUT OR BAN PEOPLE OUT FROM PAPER BASED TO FOOD PACKAGING. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES HERE TO PRESENT- ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ARE SAFE FOR FOOD PACKAGING INCORRECT FIRST WE HAVE ANNA READ. A STAFF SCIENTIST WITHIN OUR DC AS WELL AS NANCY BROOKMYRE SENIOR POLICY STRATEGIST WITH BREAST. CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS. VERY GOOD. SO YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH OR YOU CAN SPLIT IT UP A DIFFERENT WAY. FIRST LET'S HEAR FROM ANNA REED OF NRDC. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIR CREEK AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS MARRIED AND I AM NOT RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL'S LEAD SCIENTIST ON PIZZA. AND ARGUE THESE THE COURT AB TWELVE HUNDRED TO RESTRICT THE UNNECESSARY USE OF PEOPLE PASSING PRE PACKAGING. INDEPENDENT SCIENTISTS NOT THIRTY TO BODIES INCLUDING CALIFORNIANS AND PARKS DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL HAVE CONCLUDED THAT P. FAST AFTER CLASS BUDGETARY CONFINEMENT ONE PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS AND LAST YEAR. THE LEGISLATURE FAITH OUT. THE USE OF ALL P. AND THIRD PARTY. AS COVERED EARLIER BY DR ANDREWS PEOPLE ARE SEARCHING. CAN BUILD UP IN OUR BODIES NOW SYSTEM WITH A Y. ARRAY OF. HEALTH EFFECTS. STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED A HIGH PROBLEMS AS- I JUST MODIFIED AND OTHER BASED PRODUCTS CONTAIN P. FAST. THESE PRODUCTS CAN EXPOSE CONSUMERS TO ACTIVATE EACH ENTER CONTAMINATION OF WATER AND FOOD PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFECYCLE. ESPECIALLY DURING PRODUCTION AND END OF LIFE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN ACCOMPLISHED CAN- CONTAMINATED WITH THE FACT FINDING TRIP PACKAGING. PHARMACY USES COMPOST IN THEIR FIELDS CAN INADVERTENTLY CONTAMINATE THE GROUNDWATER CROPS AND LIVESTOCK. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT MULTIPLE COMPANIES CURRENTLY PRODUCED BE FAST FOOD. PACKAGING SITE P. FAST FREAK THREE PACKAGING AND INDUSTRY IS FALLING OR LEAD MAJOR CHAINS LIKE MCDONALD'S CHIPOTLE AND WHOLE FOODS. AND SMALLER CHAINS LIKE SWEETGREEN HAVE MADE COMMITMENTS TO AND THE USE OF P. FASCINATED PACKAGING. FOR LOCAL SIX TO SUCH A SAN FRANCISCO BERKELEY HAVE ALREADY FOR OUT THE THAT THE CONTAIN FEEDBACK.

PPP CENTER PERRIN BERMAN HOW CLEAN WATER ACTION ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP AND AN RTC. AB TWELVE HUNDRED BANS THE SALE AND DISTRIBUTION OF FOOD PACKAGING CONTAINING INTENTIONALLY OUT OF PEACE HOUSE. YEAH JUST LAID OUT ABOUT THIS IS SO I WILL FOCUS ON THE COOKWARE PORTION OF THE BILL. WHICH REQUIRES COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE CHEMICALS OF CONCERN COOKWARE AND PROHIBITS MARKETING CLAIMS THAT MISLEAD CONSUMERS INTO THINKING A PRODUCT IS FREE A PROBLEMATIC CLASSES OF CHEMICALS. SUCH AS PIZZA. RECENT TESTING SOUND CHEMICALS IN BOTH COOK AND BAKEWARE SPECIFICALLY P. FAST CHEMICALS SUCH AS PTSD OFTEN KNOWN BY THE BRAND NAME TEFLON. IN THE HORMONE DISRUPTING CHEMICAL CALLED ISRAEL AND IT WILL BE PA. YOU CAN BE REAL INTO THE AIR WHEN HANDS REACH HIGH TEMPERATURES WHICH EXPOSES CONSUMERS. AND CONSUMERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THIS TOXIC CHEMICALS ARE IN THE COOK WHERE THEY USED TO PREPARE FOOD FOR THEIR FAMILIES. AND WHEN BUYING PANS OFTEN THE CLAIM PFOA OR PFOS FREE OR OTHER SIMILAR CLAIMS ON PACKAGING. GIVING THEM THE FALSE IMPRESSION THE PRODUCT IS FREE OF ALL SIMILAR TOXIC CHEMICALS. IN FACT HE CELEBRATE PANS ARE OFTEN MADE WITH ANOTHER FORM OF PEACE US. MANUFACTURER SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO MISLEAD CONSUMERS AB TWELVE HUNDRED PROHIBIT A CLAIM A CLAIM THAT THE PANDAS FREE OF A PARTICULAR CHEMICAL THAT'S ANOTHER AZARDOUS CHEMICALS.

ON PRODUCTS THAT WILL CONTAIN ONE OR MORE CHEMICALS OF CONCERN FOR HUMAN HEALTH OR THE ENVIRONMENT AT THE END OF BY BY THE STATE CALIFORNIA. AT BACKGROUND- THE BILL USES THE HE CAN'T HE CAN'T A CHEMICAL LIST WHICH IS ONLY BOUT THREE THOUSAND SO CHEMICAL. COMPILED FROM VARIOUS AUTHORITATIVE LIST. THAT MAKE THAT A CERTAIN HAVE OR TRADE. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS NOT A FAN LIST. NOR DOES IT INDICATE THAT YOU COUNTLESS PROS A POTENTIAL THREAT TO HUMAN HEALTH THE ENVIRONMENT AS THEY MIGHT BE USED. IN PACIFIC PRODUCT APPLICATION. AND THAT WITH THIS IS WELL BEYOND JUST. FOCUSING ON. THE BALLOT IN THE STREET. EVEN UNDER PROP SIXTY. PRODUCT WITH THE DISCOUNT. THAT MAY RESULT IN EXPO BELOW SIR THRESHOLD. THEY LEVEL OF YOU WILL ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE A WARM. AND OUR VIEW THIS BILL DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE ANY SORT OF SIMILAR PROVISION- NOR TAKING ACCOUNT ANY SORT OF- THE MINIMUM LEVEL. WE THINK IT WOULD BE A TROUBLING PRECEDENT REQUIRE A WARNING LABEL- THAT IN OUR VIEW INAPPROPRIATELY- HEALTH AND HUMAN THE PRODUCT THEY MAY BE USING- IS NOT IT POTENTIAL RISK TO HUMAN HEALTH THE ENVIRONMENT SO.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR CONTINUING TO WORK WITH US ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC- THIS IS ASSEMBLY BILL ONE HUNDRED WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH A LEAD LEACHING PERFORMANCE STANDARD TO COMPLY AS LEAD FREE. IT WOULD REQUIRE IN USE FIXTURES TO LEEDS LESS THAN ONE MILLIGRAM PER LITER LED. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE NSF INTERNATIONAL TESTED FIVE HUNDRED FAUCETS THAT MET THE CALIFORNIA LEAD CONTENT STANDARDS AND FOUND THAT 25% OF THE FAUCET AND LET- TESTED LEACHED NOTICEABLE AMOUNTS OF LEAD. WE ALL EXPECT THE WATER WE DRINK WILL KEEP US HEALTHY AND NOT MAKE IT SICK. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN WORKING TO REDUCE RESIDENTS EXPOSURE TO LED YET. LET IS STILL REACHING INTO OUR DRINKING WATER THROUGH FAUCETS AND FIXTURES. THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE ALL FAUCETS AND FIXTURES LEACH AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE I HAVE SUSAN LITTLE SENIOR ADVOCATE FOR CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR QUIRK CHAIR- MY NAME AGAIN IS SUSAN LITTLE AND I'M WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF AB ONE HUNDRED. AS YOU KNOW THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL HAS STATED THAT THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF LEAD IN CHILDREN. THIS IS BECAUSE EVEN VERY SMALL AMOUNTS OF LEAD CAN CAUSE PERMANENT HARM LEADING TO LEARNING AND BEHAVIORAL DIFFICULTIES. GIVEN THAT SERIOUS AFFECTS CALIFORNIA'S LICENSED CHILD CARE CENTERS WILL SOON BE TESTING THEIR DRINKING WATER FOR LEAD WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF PUBLIC FUNDS. AND THESE FUNDS WILL BY THE CENTER'S NEW FAUCETS SHOULD CENTERS NEED TO REPLACE FIXTURES TO GET LET OUT OF THEIR WATER. A MUCH STRONGER LEAD LEACHING STANDARD FOR FAUCETS WAS HAS BEEN RECENTLY APPROVED WITH INDUSTRY SUPPORT. BY THE NATIONAL SANITATION FOUNDATION THE NSF A THIRD PARTY CERTIFIER. HOWEVER THIS NEW STANDARD WILL NOT APPLY TO ALL FAUCETS IN THE U. S. MARKET UNTIL AT LEAST TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. IN THE MEANTIME THE LOWER LEACHING FAUCETS WILL NOT BE EASY TO IDENTIFY OR PURCHASE. IN FACT CLEAN WATER ACTION ONE OF AB ONE HUNDRED CO SPNSORS PERFORMED AS BAY OF FAUCETS ON THE CIRCLE HOME DEPOT- DEPARTMENTS HOME DEPOT STORES. NONE OF THE FAUCET PACKAGES REVIEWED CONTAINED VISIBLE INFORMATION ABOUT US ITS LEAD LEACHING STANDARD. SCHOOLS CHILD CARES AND CONSUMERS WANT TO PURCHASE FAUCETS THAT LEACH HAS LITTLE THAT IS POSSIBLE. AB ONE HUNDRED WILL ADDRESS THE NEED THIS NEED AND REQUIRE ALL FAWCETT SOLD IN CALIFORNIA TO MEET THE NOTE NEW LOW LEACHING STANDARD.

THIS AFFECTED DATA CONSISTENT WITH RPMI SUPPORT POSITION ON LAST YEAR VERSIONS OF THIS MEASURE AB TWENTY SIXTY BY A SEVEN MEMBER HOLDEN STEP ALMOST CROSSED THE FINISH LINE BUT WAS UNFORTUNATELY HELD ON TO SPENT THAN THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE.

SEVEN THREE TWO- IT THE- AND IT'S ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL- THEY'LL- SO- VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS BILL INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL FEE. NOR CLOSE A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT OF THE TOXIC SUBSTANCE YOU ARE TROUT ACT. THIS FEE INCREASE IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE STABLE FUNDING FOR THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM AND THE SITE MITIGATION PROGRAM UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL. WELL THE GOVERNOR HAS INTRODUCED A BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT ALSO INCREASES THE ENVIRONMENTAL FEE. I INTRODUCED THIS BILL BECAUSE THERE ARE VERY IMPORTANT POLICY ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH. WITHIN DURING WITH ENSURING THAT DTS SHE HAS SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO REFILL ITS- STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS ONE PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR THAT IS FUNDED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL FEE. IS A SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM WHICH WE REFER TO A NUMBER OF TIMES BOY. I LOST MY AUDIENCE THANK YOU- THE IDEA OF THIS PROGRAM IS GREAT- SCIENTIFIC LOOK AT CHEMICAL PRODUCTS HOWEVER WE BOTH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF NOT PROPERLY FUNDED THE PROGRAM WE DON'T PROBABLY FUND THIS PROGRAM WE WILL ABSOLUTELY MISS OUT ON AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A WORLD CLASS PRODUCT CHEMICAL EVALUATION PROGRAM. DITION LES THE ENVIRONMENTAL FEE FUNDS THE CLEANUP OF CONTAMINATED SITES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. DGSE IS HUNDREDS OF THE STATE'S WITH SITES WITHIN THE DATABASE. THAT THEY MAY KNOW ABOUT BUT LACKS THE RESOURCES TO EITHER INVESTIGATE FURTHER OR TO INITIATE A CLEAN UP. IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED BY THE U. S. EPA THAT THERE MIGHT BE AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CONTAMINATED SITES IN CALIFORNIA. THERE WERE NOT CURRENTLY AWARE OF WHO WE NEED A STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING TO INVESTIGATE THESE SITES AND ULTIMATELY RESTORE THE SITES TO PRODUCTIVE USE. THIS IS A TAX AND- IT WILL NEED TO BE- ENACTED WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE- IF WE ARE ABLE TO PROPERLY FUND THESE PROGRAMS HUNDRED DS- UNDER DGSE- THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT IS TO RAISE A TAX. SOEONE HAS A BETTER PROPOSAL TO REVIVE A STABLE FUND STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS IS NOT A TAX. THEN PLEASE DO SO UNTIL THEN I THINK WE NEED TO WORK WITH WHAT WE HAVE AND THAT IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL FEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AT THIS TIME I'LL INVITE THE PUBLIC IN THE HEARING ROOM TO TESTIFY. SEEING NONE IN SUPPORT. ANY PUBLIC IN A ROOM FOR OPPOSITION. KCA NONETHELESS A FOR MODERATOR IF THERE'S ANYWITNESSES ON THE PHONE LINE IN OPPOSITION OR SUPPORT OF AB. SEVEN THIRTY TWO. YOU TO STATE YOUR POSITION AND AB SEVEN THIRTY TWO YOU MAY PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. ONCE AGAIN USING YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD HMI PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. DO YOU TURN ONLINE THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. THE NEW QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES SIR. SO MISTER CHAIRMAN I- GIVE YOU A HEADS UP THAT I HAVE SOME CONCERNS AND MY CONCERN WAS- DISCUSSED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHERE. THE GOVERNOR. IS PROPOSING. A MAJOR REFORM TO THE FEE STRUCTURE ALSO- WHICH INCLUDES THE CHANGES TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL THREE. AND- THE PROPOSAL. PERMANENTLY ELIMINATES A FEE FOR BUSINESSES WITH LAWSON HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. I GUESS THIRD DEFINITION OF SMALL BUSINESSES FREEZES THE FEE FOR BUSINESSES WITH THE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED NINETY NINE. I'M MORE THAN TROUBLES A FEE FOR BUSINESSES WITH FIVE HUNDRED MORE EMPLOYEES WHICH I THINK IT'S BEEN. IF NOT THE TRYING TO LEASE TO. THIRD THERE'S BEEN GREATER CALLS FOR. YOU KNOW LARGE CORPORATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO PAY OFF. THEIR FAIR SHARE- AND TO TRY TO HELP OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE- SO GIVEN THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED IN THIS- WHY SHOULD I SUPPORT YOUR BILL. GOOD QUESTION THE ANSWER IS- I THAT FIRST OF ALL IF WE DO IT- IF WE DO THAT THE FEE BECOMES MUCH LARGER APPROACH MY STAFF HAS THE EXACT NUMBER BUT THE FEE BECOMES MUCH LARGER ON THE BIGGER COMPANIES. IF IT'S A CONSENSUS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT THEY PREFERRED THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH- I'M PERFECTLY HAPPY TO DO THAT AND ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE DOING THIS. IS THAT WHILE YOU CAN SAYTHAT THIS IS A TAX IT IS BUT IT'S ALSO POLICY CONSIDERATIONS BOTH IN TERMS OF. WHO PAYS AS WELL AS- HOW THE MONEY IS USED IN THIS IS A WORTHWHILE- USE OF THE MONEY AND THAT WHAT I WANT TO FIND FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IS DO THEY FEEL THIS IS A WORTHWHILE USE- WOULD THEY PREFER THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH. AND THEN FINALLY IS THERE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THEY NEED TO ASSURE THE MONEY IS BEING USED PROPERLY. WE HEARD EARLIER FROM THE- SECRETARY AND THE DEPARTMENT HAD- THAT THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE METRICS AND OTHER THINGS. MY QUESTION FOR- THE COMMITTEE IS- ARE YOU READY TO SUPPORT THAT YOU NEED TO GET MORE INFORMATION FIRST LIKE WHAT THE METRICS WOULD BE. BUT THAT'S THE REASON FOR BRINGING THIS FORTH NOW AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW YOUR OPINION AND YOU CLEARLY SEEM TO PREFER AT THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH AND- I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM OTHER MEMBERS AS WELL- DO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE- BILL OTHERWISE. WELL I THINK- WE ALL. APPRECIATE HAVING GOT. A LEGISLATIVE VEHICLE TO ENSURE THAT TO. THAT WE CAN HAVE THESE- NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE- BUT IN THIS CASE IT SEEMS LIKE OUR LEGISLATIVE VEHICLE WOULD BE THE BUDGET BILL- AND SO I- I WOULD PREFER THAT- WE FOCUS THAT- NEGOTIATIONS. ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL FEE THROUGH THE BUDGET BILL- RATHER THAN THIS BILL OKAY IF THIS BILL DOES NOT. PROVIDE ANY FURTHER POLICY GUIDANCE BEYOND WHAT WE WOULD WE COULD- INSERTED INTO THE BUDGET. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI. ON THE TO DO WHAT THE BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS ONLY TESTIMONY ONLY THERE'S NO VOTE I HAVE A MESSAGE WILL BE TESTIMONIAL K. AND MR HOLDEN HAS TO LEAVE TO BECAUSE HE'S GOT A TWELVE OKAY. FIND GO AHEAD PLEASE THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR I'M THANK YOU MR CLARK FOR PRESENTING THIS AS YOU HEARD MY QUESTION EARLIER TO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRACIE AND THE ADMINISTRATION MY CONCERN IS IF WE ARE INCREASING FEES IF WE ARE IMPOSING THIS TAX ON CORPORATIONS AND BUSINESSES THAT WE ENSURE THAT WE ARE DOING SO TO A DEPARTMENT THAT IS ACTUALLY DOING THEIR JOB RIGHT AND I THINK MANY OF US ON THIS COMMITTEE FEEL LIKE CURRENTLY THAT'S NOT. THE CASE THE DGSE AND SO THROWING MORE MONEY AT AN AGENCY THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE IS ADEQUATELY PERFORMING FEELS. THE BEST CHOICE NECESSARILY- BUT I ALSO HEAR WHAT THE AGENCY SAID IN THEIR NEED FOR MORE RESOURCES TO DO THE JOB. AND THAT YOU KNOW HAVING NOT READ THE SEASON DECADES THAT THAT'S AN INTEGRAL PART OF ENSURING THAT THIS THE AGENCY IS FUNCTIONING. BUT I. SHARE WHAT YOU JUST SAID ABOUT WANTING TO HEAR FROM US ABOUT WHAT IT IS WE NEED. AND I APPRECIATE WHAT THE SECRETARY SAID BUT IN MY QUESTION TO THE ADMINISTRATION I ASKED WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC METRICS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SHOW US. THAT IF WE GIVE YOU THIS MONEY YOU ARE PERFORMING IN YES EVERY TIME THERE IS IF YOU HAVE TO COME BACK BUT THE FIRST TIME WE RAISE THAT FEE WE'RE DOING IT SOMEWHAT IN BLIND FAITH THAT THIS IS GONNA. THAT THEY WILL START PERFORMING AND DOING THE WORK THAT BUSINESSES NEED THEM TO DO AND TO THE POINT THAT A FAMILY MEMBER GARCIA MADE. YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY HASN'T GOTTEN THEIR PERMITS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THEY CAN'T OPERATE IN THE WAY THEY WANT TO OPERATE SO THERE IS INCENTIVES TO THE BUSINESSES TO ONE DGSE TO WORK GREAT THEY CAN BETTER. DO THEIR JOB IF THE CHASSIS IS- HELPING THEM DO IT SO. I SEE THE BENEFIT OF IT BUT I THINK THAT WHAT I REALLY NEED IS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT METRICS ARE IN PLACE. WHEN WE'RE GOING TO SEE THEM I WANT TO SEE YOU KNOW THE SECRETARY SPOKE EARLIER ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SITES THAT HAVE YET TO BE CLEANED UP OKAY. ARE WE GOING TO SEE. TEN THOUSAND A MONTH THINK WE ARE WE GONNA SEE TWENTY THOUSAND A YEAR WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO CHECK THOSE WE'RE GIVING YOU THIS MONEY WE EXPECT PERFORMANCE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THOSE METRICS. AND I THINK THAT'S THE KEY TO FEELING COMFORTABLE GIVING THEM ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IS KNOWING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THOSE METRICS THAT THEY WILL BE FORCED TO PERFORM THEM. AND THAT WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE OKAY SO WHAT I WILL OFFER IS FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHO WANT TO HEAR MORE. IS IT WE TRY AND GET A MEETING- QUICKLY- AND GET THE DISCUSSION OF METRICS AND OTHER THINGS THAT WILL GIVE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS- CONFIDENCE. AND OF COURSE WE ALSO THE FACT THAT THEY NOW. A BOARD. AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH YOU FEEL THAT THAT ALSO WOULD INCREASE YOUR CONFIDENCE. CAN I ASK TO THAT. PART OF THE PROBLEM WAS AND WORK THEY HAVE TO DO AND HOW THEY HAVE BEEN USING THE DOLLARS AND SO THE WORK LOAD ANALYSIS THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO US ACTUALLY GIVES US A RANGE WHERE IT TALKS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IF WE HAVE THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY WHAT CAN WE DO AND HOW QUICKLY CAN WE GET TO THE SITES- AND THE RANGES ANYWHERE FROM YOU KNOW TEN YEARS TO A HUNDRED YEARS DEPENDING AT THE PACE THAT WILL WORKING AND- AT THE CURRENT PACE AT WHICH WE'RE GOING TO SUCCEED TO BE HUNDRED TWO YEARS- THAT THOSE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO LIVE- AND THIS POLLUTION SO. I DO THINK THAT THERE'S MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THAT IN ITSELF DOES NOT GIVE US THE ASSURANCES THAT WE NEED- ANYTHING GIVEN THE HISTORY OF THE AGENCY IT'S HARD TO SAY HERE'S SOME MONEY- BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS WHERE WE ARE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE GOVERNANCE REFORMS THE ACCOUNTABILITY. THE ROLE OF THE BORDERS I THINK WELL THERE'S AN AGREEMENT ON THE BOARD THE ROLE OF THE BOARD TO HAVE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY ARE YOU STILL DETAILS THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED AND SO AS WE DO THE WORK IT'S BEEN CLEAR TO WAS THAT IS NOT. ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER WE HAVE TO DO BOTH. THANK YOU FOR. VERY GOOD. IT DIDN'T. PRETTY MUCH MY COMMENTS. SAME THING. ATTACK EVER BUSINESSES ARE. PUBLIC WHAT DO. GET FOR THAT MONEY THAT. YOU'RE BEING. FOR SO I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME MORE DISCUSSION. TO SEE IF WE CAN NARROW DOWN IT'S GOING TO BE THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY. THIS COULD BE USED FOR THIS. AND THERE'S IN RESULTS THAT WE CAN SEE AT THE VERY END. AND IT'S NOT. TEN YEARS DOWN THE ROAD. YEAH WELL LET'S TRY AND FIND A WAY. TO EITHER MEET AS A COMMITTEE OR IF WE CAN'T GET THEM. MEDIAN AN INFORMAL MEETING- TO GET INFORMATION- WE- IF WE DO IT INFORMALLY OF COURSE WE'VE- WE- YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF. WHAT WE DO BUT IF IT'S STRICTLY. FOR INFORMATION WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT- I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS BUT IT'S VERY CLEAR WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO ME AND I'LL TAKE THAT AS MY CLOTHES PERFECT THANK YOU NOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME BACK UP THE CLOSING MEETING OR EARLY DOCTOR ARAMBULA- IT WILL LEAVE IT OPEN.
