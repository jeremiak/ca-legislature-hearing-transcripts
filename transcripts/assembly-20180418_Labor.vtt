00:39:31.703 --> 00:39:34.672 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY THAT GUIDANCE IS HARD

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:36.274 region:rollup2
TO FIND.

00:39:34.672 --> 00:39:39.310 region:rollup2
WHEN I FIRST BECAME AN EMPLOYER

00:39:36.274 --> 00:39:41.646 region:rollup2
AT AGE EIGHTEEN I HAD NO IDEA OF

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:43.248 region:rollup2
THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AROUND

00:39:41.646 --> 00:39:43.815 region:rollup2
I'M FLYING A DOMESTIC WORKER.

00:39:43.248 --> 00:39:45.450 region:rollup2
I HAD TO FIGURE IT OUT ON MY

00:39:43.815 --> 00:39:47.018 region:rollup2
OWN.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:48.519 region:rollup2
AND I WAS FRUSTRATED WITH HOW

00:39:47.018 --> 00:39:50.588 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT IT WAS TO FIND ANY

00:39:48.519 --> 00:39:52.690 region:rollup2
INFORMATION. ON HOW TO BE A

00:39:50.588 --> 00:39:54.025 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE DOMESTIC REQUIRE OF

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:57.095 region:rollup2
A CAREGIVER.

00:39:54.025 --> 00:39:59.063 region:rollup2
AND I WANT TO BE AGAIN EMPLOYER.

00:39:57.095 --> 00:40:01.599 region:rollup2
IN MY JOB AND AS A TRAINER WITH

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:03.201 region:rollup2
HAND IN HAND GIVING WORKSHOPS TO

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:05.870 region:rollup2
NEW ATTEND AND INQUIRES. I HOW

00:40:03.201 --> 00:40:07.171 region:rollup2
TO BE A FAIR DOMESTIC EMPLOYER.

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:09.007 region:rollup2
I WORKED WITH PEOPLE WITH

00:40:07.171 --> 00:40:10.575 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES AND SENIORS THAT

00:40:09.007 --> 00:40:12.010 region:rollup2
HAVE HAD THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT

00:40:10.575 --> 00:40:13.578 region:rollup2
I DID.

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:15.113 region:rollup2
MANY OF THEM EMPLOYEE CARE

00:40:13.578 --> 00:40:16.681 region:rollup2
URANUS EVERYDAY. BERNARD

00:40:15.113 --> 00:40:17.949 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE BECAUSE THEY ALSO DO

00:40:16.681 --> 00:40:18.516 region:rollup2
NOT KNOW THE LAWS AND

00:40:17.949 --> 00:40:21.686 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS AROUND DOMESTIC

00:40:18.516 --> 00:40:23.788 region:rollup2
WORK.

00:40:21.686 --> 00:40:25.490 region:rollup2
MOST EMPLOYERS LIKE ME VALUED

00:40:23.788 --> 00:40:26.991 region:rollup2
THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT DOMESTIC

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:29.127 region:rollup2
WORKERS MAKE SURE THEIR HOMES

00:40:26.991 --> 00:40:30.928 region:rollup2
AND LIVES. BUT DO NOT HAVE THE

00:40:29.127 --> 00:40:33.064 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND TOOLS TO IN OUR

00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:35.133 region:rollup2
CURRENT RESPONSIBILITIES AND TO

00:40:33.064 --> 00:40:38.870 region:rollup2
BE AN AFFAIR EMPLOYERS.

00:40:35.133 --> 00:40:41.005 region:rollup2
AB TO 23-14 WOULD CHANGE THAT BY

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:42.874 region:rollup2
CREATING A CENTRALIZED PLACE TO

00:40:41.005 --> 00:40:44.676 region:rollup2
FIND RELEVANT INFORMATION.

00:40:42.874 --> 00:40:46.544 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULD CREATE A PROGRAM OF

00:40:44.676 --> 00:40:48.813 region:rollup2
EDUCATION TO REACH THE GROWING

00:40:46.544 --> 00:40:51.249 region:rollup2
POPULATION OF EMPLOYERS.

00:40:48.813 --> 00:40:52.550 region:rollup2
TO EMPOWER THEM TWO HUNDRED

00:40:51.249 --> 00:40:54.052 region:rollup2
STAND THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES.

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:55.920 region:rollup2
AND UPHOLD FAIR PRACTICES IN

00:40:54.052 --> 00:40:59.724 region:rollup2

00:56:26.883 --> 00:56:31.054 region:rollup2
ONE YEAR IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH

00:56:29.119 --> 00:56:33.924 region:rollup2
TIME TO BRING HARASSMENT AND

00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:35.225 region:rollup2

JUSTICE.

00:57:01.051 --> 00:57:03.987 region:rollup2
IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT MOST

01:19:41.543 --> 01:19:44.380 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE USUALLY FEELS LIKE

01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:46.282 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT BEING LISTENED TO.

01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:47.916 region:rollup2
OFTEN IT MEANS THAT THE

01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:49.618 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER IS NOT APPROPRIATELY

01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:51.053 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATING THE COMPLAINT AND

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:53.055 region:rollup2
A LOT OF TIMES IT MEANS THAT THE

01:19:51.053 --> 01:19:55.257 region:rollup2
PERSON WHO IS. ENGAGING IN THE

01:19:53.055 --> 01:19:56.558 region:rollup2
HARASSING CONDUCT DOES NOT FEEL

01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:58.260 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT CONDUCT.

01:19:56.558 --> 01:19:59.495 region:rollup2
ON AN AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS

01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:00.963 region:rollup2
POINTED OUT IT'S ALSO VIRTUALLY

01:19:59.495 --> 01:20:02.398 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY WHEN

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:03.899 region:rollup2
THERE ARE REPEAT OFFENDERS

01:20:02.398 --> 01:20:04.967 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IF THE WORKER MOVES

01:20:03.899 --> 01:20:07.069 region:rollup2
AROUND TO DIFFERENT JOBS ARE

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:08.771 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. ON IN A

01:20:07.069 --> 01:20:09.905 region:rollup2
VERY LARGE CORPORATION.

01:20:08.771 --> 01:20:11.540 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE HEARD FROM MANY

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:13.042 region:rollup2
CASES WHERE THERE ARE MULTIPLE

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:14.510 region:rollup2

ALLEGED AGAINST THE SAME.

01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:17.746 region:rollup2

01:20:16.245 --> 01:20:18.714 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO DOCUMENTATION THERE

01:20:17.746 --> 01:20:19.982 region:rollup2
WAS NO COORDINATION OF THE

01:20:18.714 --> 01:20:20.983 region:rollup2

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:21.750 region:rollup2
WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE ON A LOT OF

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:23.652 region:rollup2
TIMES IT'S.

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:25.888 region:rollup2
IT ESCALATES

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:27.056 region:rollup2
I'M AND THE FEE HOW DOES REQUIRE

01:20:25.888 --> 01:20:28.691 region:rollup2
THAT EMPLOYERS TAKE ALL

01:20:27.056 --> 01:20:29.892 region:rollup2
REASONABLE STEPS TO PREVENT

01:20:28.691 --> 01:20:31.493 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT FROM OCCURRING IN THE

01:20:29.892 --> 01:20:31.994 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE. AND WE NEED TO MAKE

COMPLAINTS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT

ALREADY COVERED UNDER THE LAW

01:23:39.281 --> 01:23:41.950 region:rollup2
THAT THESE DOCUMENTS SHOULD THAT

THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR TEN YEARS

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:57.633 region:rollup2
WE FEEL THIS IS OVER BURDENING

01:23:56.498 --> 01:23:58.967 region:rollup2
ON EMPLOYERS WHO WOULD THEN HAVE

01:23:57.633 --> 01:24:00.269 region:rollup2

01:24:21.123 --> 01:24:24.059 region:rollup2
ALREADY STATED WOULD LIKE JUST

01:24:22.024 --> 01:24:25.761 region:rollup2
ADD SOME SPECIFIC CONCERNS THAT

01:24:24.059 --> 01:24:26.595 region:rollup2
SMALL EMPLOYERS HAVE ON THIS AS

01:24:25.761 --> 01:24:28.163 region:rollup2

TO TO MEET ALL OF THESE

DIFFERENT NEEDS. AND SO THIS.

01:24:47.249 --> 01:24:49.418 region:rollup2
SO THESE ARE COMPLICATIONS THAT

WOULD ADD.

01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:53.188 region:rollup2

01:24:55.991 --> 01:24:58.660 region:rollup2
BURDEN TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS

01:24:56.925 --> 01:24:59.227 region:rollup2
I THINK. ONE OF THE KEY POINTS

01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:01.330 region:rollup2
IS THAT.

01:24:59.227 --> 01:25:02.931 region:rollup2
WE SAW AS THE AUTHORITY STATED.

01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:04.600 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE ITSELF IS IS

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:06.034 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THIS VERY COMPLEX AND

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:08.070 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE.

01:25:06.034 --> 01:25:09.871 region:rollup2
JUST DEFINING THESE THINGS WHAT

01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:11.440 region:rollup2
IS A COMPLAINT WHAT DEFINES IT

01:25:09.871 --> 01:25:12.874 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTES A FORMAL COMPLAINT

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.543 region:rollup2
AND A COMPLAINT PROCESS IS A

01:25:12.874 --> 01:25:15.544 region:rollup2
COMPLEX ISSUE AND DIFFICULT TO

01:25:14.543 --> 01:25:17.012 region:rollup2
DEFINE.

WE OUR PROUD COSPONSORED AB

01:31:24.179 --> 01:31:27.148 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIX THIRTEEN BECAUSE

01:31:26.114 --> 01:31:29.517 region:rollup2
UNDER CURRENT LAW THERE IS NO

ARE NOT PAID ON TIME.

01:31:31.186 --> 01:31:34.956 region:rollup2
THIS CAN CAUSE EXTREME FINANCIAL

01:31:32.887 --> 01:31:36.691 region:rollup2
HARDSHIP FOR MANY EMPLOYEES WHO

01:31:34.956 --> 01:31:38.827 region:rollup2
LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK.

01:31:36.691 --> 01:31:40.195 region:rollup2

NECESSITIES.

01:31:43.598 --> 01:31:46.701 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM IS THAT EMPLOYEES

WERE PAID LATE HAVE NO CLEAR

01:31:46.701 --> 01:31:50.138 region:rollup2

TO FILE A LAWSUIT UNDER THE

01:31:51.573 --> 01:31:55.377 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LABOR STANDARDS ACT WILL

01:31:53.241 --> 01:31:57.545 region:rollup2
BE CONFLICTS THAT.

01:31:55.377 --> 01:31:58.913 region:rollup2
TO RECOVER THE UNPAID WAGES PLUS

01:31:57.545 --> 01:32:00.148 region:rollup2
AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO LIQUIDATED

01:31:58.913 --> 01:32:01.816 region:rollup2

PREJUDGMENT INTEREST.

01:32:01.816 --> 01:32:03.752 region:rollup2

LIQUIDATED DAMAGES.

01:32:13.661 --> 01:32:17.232 region:rollup2
BUT THESE EFFORTS ARE OFTEN NOT

01:32:15.163 --> 01:32:18.500 region:rollup2
REALISTIC FOR EMPLOYEES WHO

01:32:17.232 --> 01:32:21.102 region:rollup2
SIMPLY WANT TO BE PAID THEIR

01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:21.970 region:rollup2

EMPLOYEES ARE RELUCTANT TO ROCK

01:32:36.584 --> 01:32:39.454 region:rollup2
THE BOAT AND PURSUE A CLAIM.

01:32:38.319 --> 01:32:41.222 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE COST OF CONFLICT

WITH THEIR EMPLOYER FOR A JOB

01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:45.393 region:rollup2
THAT THEY DESPERATELY NEED TO

01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:46.828 region:rollup2
KEEP AND THEY FEAR RETALIATION.

01:32:45.393 --> 01:32:48.396 region:rollup2
UNDER THE CURRENT LABOR CODE

01:32:52.867 --> 01:32:55.136 region:rollup2
BUT UNFORTUNATELY ONLY

01:32:54.069 --> 01:32:56.671 region:rollup2
ENFORCEABLE THROUGH AN

AGGRIEVED WORKER.

01:33:01.409 --> 01:33:03.678 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE LIMITATIONS THAT

PROVISION IS SIMPLY NEVER

01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:06.481 region:rollup2
UTILIZED.

01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:08.450 region:rollup2
THAT LEAVES EMPLOYERS WITH

IMMIGRANT WORKERS TO RECOVER THE

01:33:37.545 --> 01:33:40.882 region:rollup2
WAGES THAT ARE OWED TO THEM.

EVERY YEAR.

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:49.357 region:rollup2
THIS LAW IS ABOUT A MOST BASIC

01:33:48.256 --> 01:33:51.726 region:rollup2
WAGE AND HOUR RIGHT FOR

01:33:49.357 --> 01:33:53.995 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES TO BE PAID THE WAGES

01:33:51.726 --> 01:33:55.463 region:rollup2

GET CALLS FROM WORKERS WHO ARE

01:33:55.463 --> 01:33:58.066 region:rollup2
NOT PAID ON TIME AND WE SEE THE

01:33:56.664 --> 01:33:58.833 region:rollup2
DEVASTATING IMPACT LATE

01:33:58.066 --> 01:34:00.401 region:rollup2

SOME MANY TIMES THEY ARE FORCED

TO LIVE WITH THEIR EMPLOYERS

01:34:07.041 --> 01:34:11.513 region:rollup2
PAYING THEM LATE. BELIEVING THAT

01:34:09.644 --> 01:34:14.015 region:rollup2
SOME MONEY AT SOME POINT IS

01:34:11.513 --> 01:34:15.450 region:rollup2
BETTER THAN NO MONEY AT ALL.

01:34:14.015 --> 01:34:17.018 region:rollup2
UNDER THE CURRENT LAW THERE IS

01:34:15.450 --> 01:34:19.354 region:rollup2
NO PRACTICAL RECORDS FOR THESE

01:34:17.018 --> 01:34:21.322 region:rollup2
WORKERS WHICH IS PERHAPS WHY THE

01:34:19.354 --> 01:34:22.857 region:rollup2
VIOLATION IS SO PREVALENT.

01:34:21.322 --> 01:34:25.059 region:rollup2
THERE IS LITTLE INCENTIVE TO

THEIR TIPS LEAVE AS WELL.

01:34:33.868 --> 01:34:36.204 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT OF THESE LATE

01:34:34.969 --> 01:34:37.872 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS WORKERS ARE NOT ABLE TO

THESE FINANCIAL PREDICAMENTS

01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:54.088 region:rollup2
CREE AND UNNECESSARY STRESS AND

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:56.257 region:rollup2
ANXIETY FOR WORKERS WHOSE LIVES

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:57.725 region:rollup2
ARE STRESSFUL ENOUGH ALREADY.

01:34:56.257 --> 01:34:59.027 region:rollup2

PAYCHECK IS ENORMOUS AND UNPAID

01:35:18.913 --> 01:35:21.516 region:rollup2
IT IS DEMORALIZING TO HAVE TO

ASK FOR MONEY THAT I HAVE WORKED

01:35:21.516 --> 01:35:24.819 region:rollup2
HARD TO EARN. IT IS ALSO VERY

01:35:23.284 --> 01:35:26.254 region:rollup2
STRESSFUL AND THE ANXIETY FROM

EVER CLIMB UP AND GET HERSELF

02:14:21.887 --> 02:14:24.523 region:rollup2
OUT OF WORKING POVERTY.

02:14:23.522 --> 02:14:26.492 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT

02:14:24.523 --> 02:14:28.060 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT.

02:14:26.492 --> 02:14:29.695 region:rollup2
THREE COMPANIES THAT DO GREAT

02:14:28.060 --> 02:14:31.163 region:rollup2
THINGS AND THEY DON'T DO

02:14:29.695 --> 02:14:33.599 region:rollup2
JANITORIAL WORK PRETTY WELL.

02:14:31.163 --> 02:14:35.301 region:rollup2
SO THEY GOING CONTRACT OUT FOR

02:14:33.599 --> 02:14:36.769 region:rollup2
THE CHEAPEST JANITORIAL WORK

02:14:35.301 --> 02:14:39.572 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE WHICH MEANS THAT IT

02:14:36.769 --> 02:14:41.740 region:rollup2
DEPRESSES WAGES.

02:14:39.572 --> 02:14:43.475 region:rollup2
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE. OUT

02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:45.144 region:rollup2
WORKING FOR VERY LITTLE THAT CAN

02:14:43.475 --> 02:14:46.545 region:rollup2
NEVER LIVE ANYWHERE NEAR WHERE

02:14:45.144 --> 02:14:47.613 region:rollup2
THEY WORK WHOSE KIDS CAN'T EVER

02:14:46.545 --> 02:14:48.981 region:rollup2
GO TO SCHOOL ANYWHERE AND DON'T

02:14:47.613 --> 02:14:50.716 region:rollup2
HAVE.

02:14:48.981 --> 02:14:53.619 region:rollup2
A FUTURE AHEAD OF THEM THAT'S

02:14:50.716 --> 02:14:55.387 region:rollup2
BETTER THAN WHAT THEY'VE GOT.

02:14:53.619 --> 02:14:58.757 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY.

02:14:55.387 --> 02:14:59.091 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY ADVANCE THE CAUSE.

02:14:58.757 --> 02:15:00.893 region:rollup2
OF.

02:14:59.091 --> 02:15:02.895 region:rollup2
O. WORKING POOR THAT'S

02:15:00.893 --> 02:15:04.263 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY. AND I I THINK I

02:15:02.895 --> 02:15:06.332 region:rollup2
PROBABLY TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS

02:15:04.263 --> 02:15:07.866 region:rollup2
BEFORE IT AT A NEW CASTE SYSTEM.

02:15:06.332 --> 02:15:08.834 region:rollup2

02:15:07.866 --> 02:15:10.669 region:rollup2
THAT WILL NEVER BE A PART OF OUR

02:15:08.834 --> 02:15:12.371 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY

02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:15.074 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE PAY THEM SO LITTLE

02:15:12.371 --> 02:15:17.209 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN NEVER. GET ARE UP

02:15:15.074 --> 02:15:19.078 region:rollup2
AYE IN IN PURSUING SECURITY FOR

02:15:17.209 --> 02:15:20.813 region:rollup2
THEIR FAMILY AND AND WHAT WE ALL

02:15:19.078 --> 02:15:21.580 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW I THINK THE GOAL NOT

02:15:34.259 --> 02:15:37.763 region:rollup2
JUST THE GOAL BUT I THINK THE

02:15:35.594 --> 02:15:40.065 region:rollup2
PREMISE IS ABSOLUTELY VALID.

02:15:37.763 --> 02:15:41.934 region:rollup2
HAVING GROWN UP IN IN SAN JOSE

02:15:40.065 --> 02:15:42.234 region:rollup2

02:15:48.374 --> 02:15:51.710 region:rollup2
REALLY LIFTED UP SO MANY IN THE

02:15:49.842 --> 02:15:52.878 region:rollup2

THE TO ANY WELL ONE INDUSTRY I

02:15:54.813 --> 02:15:57.950 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THE PART OF THE

02:15:55.981 --> 02:15:59.184 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT WE'VE SEEN. THIS

02:15:57.950 --> 02:16:01.186 region:rollup2
ISSUE A CONTRACT NOT NOT DOES OF

02:15:59.184 --> 02:16:03.122 region:rollup2
OF TIME DETACHMENT FROM CERTAIN

ASPECTS OF WORK.

02:16:03.122 --> 02:16:07.459 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED EVERYONE HAVING THE

SEEN SOME. PROBLEMS THAT IT WAS

02:16:12.064 --> 02:16:15.200 region:rollup2
HARD AND PART OF IT HAS BEEN

02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:16.902 region:rollup2
THROUGH ORGANIZING.

02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:18.237 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT

02:16:16.902 --> 02:16:19.338 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN BENEFITS TO IT FOR

02:16:18.237 --> 02:16:21.006 region:rollup2

02:21:35.053 --> 02:21:37.956 region:rollup2
THE WORKERS THERE TODAY WERE NOT

02:21:36.822 --> 02:21:39.958 region:rollup2
PART OF THE DECISION MAKING NOT

FORCED UPON THEM.

02:21:53.805 --> 02:21:57.542 region:rollup2
AND WAGES THAT THEY HAD NOTHING

TO THEIR PAYCHECKS.

02:22:01.680 --> 02:22:03.882 region:rollup2

PROTECTIONS AGAINST THIS

02:22:03.882 --> 02:22:06.952 region:rollup2

02:31:39.223 --> 02:31:43.394 region:rollup2
STATE OF THE LAW.

02:31:41.426 --> 02:31:45.096 region:rollup2
THE AUTHOR.

02:31:43.394 --> 02:31:47.131 region:rollup2
TOLD EVERYONE HERE TODAY THAT

02:31:45.096 --> 02:31:48.800 region:rollup2
THE LAW IS SILENT ON THIS ISSUE.

02:31:47.131 --> 02:31:50.735 region:rollup2
THAT IS FALSE.

02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:52.870 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S PAUL.

02:31:50.735 --> 02:31:54.605 region:rollup2
THE LAW IS NOT SIGNED.

02:31:52.870 --> 02:31:57.308 region:rollup2
FOR ALMOST FOUR DECADES.

02:31:54.605 --> 02:31:58.543 region:rollup2
VARIOUS.

02:31:57.308 --> 02:32:01.212 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE AGRICULTURAL

02:32:05.583 --> 02:32:09.554 region:rollup2
ABANDONMENT DEFENSE.

02:32:08.252 --> 02:32:12.457 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WOULD PERMIT

02:32:09.554 --> 02:32:13.624 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS TO REFUSE TO BARGAIN

02:32:12.457 --> 02:32:15.960 region:rollup2
WITH THE UNION SELECTED BY THEIR

02:32:13.624 --> 02:32:18.363 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES.

02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:18.896 region:rollup2
THAT LA HAS BEEN NOT ONLY

02:32:18.363 --> 02:32:19.697 region:rollup2
APPROVED BY THE COURTS OF

02:32:18.896 --> 02:32:21.699 region:rollup2
APPEAL.

02:32:19.697 --> 02:32:23.901 region:rollup2
BUT RECENTLY.

02:32:21.699 --> 02:32:25.570 region:rollup2
IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION.

02:32:23.901 --> 02:32:27.372 region:rollup2
SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA

02:32:25.570 --> 02:32:30.074 region:rollup2
SUPREME COURT SUPPORTED DOT

02:32:27.372 --> 02:32:32.210 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW.

02:32:30.074 --> 02:32:33.411 region:rollup2
FOR THE AUTHOR TO SAY. THAT THE

02:32:32.210 --> 02:32:38.850 region:rollup2
LOT SILENT IT'S FALSE.

02:32:33.411 --> 02:32:40.985 region:rollup2
IT'S FALSE.

02:32:38.850 --> 02:32:43.421 region:rollup2
THIS IDEA OF ABANDONMENT HAS

02:32:40.985 --> 02:32:46.124 region:rollup2
BEEN REJECTED PRECISELY BECAUSE

02:32:43.421 --> 02:32:47.525 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS REFUSED TO BARGAIN.

02:32:46.124 --> 02:32:51.896 region:rollup2
WITH UNIONS THAT ARE REPRESENTED

02:32:47.525 --> 02:32:53.131 region:rollup2
BY EMPLOYEES.

02:32:51.896 --> 02:32:54.432 region:rollup2
THE LAS VERY CLEAR THE

02:32:53.131 --> 02:32:55.600 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS

02:32:54.432 --> 02:32:57.468 region:rollup2
APPROVED THIS INTERPRETATION

02:32:55.600 --> 02:32:59.470 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO NEED.

02:32:57.468 --> 02:33:02.507 region:rollup2
I TRY TO CHANGE THAT LAW BECAUSE

02:32:59.470 --> 02:33:04.242 region:rollup2
THE LABOR BOARD HAS EXPERTISE.

02:33:02.507 --> 02:33:07.278 region:rollup2
THE JUSTICES HAVE LOOKED AT THIS

02:33:04.242 --> 02:33:09.414 region:rollup2
ISSUE AND HAVE REJECTED IT.

02:33:07.278 --> 02:33:12.216 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUE OF

02:33:09.414 --> 02:33:13.418 region:rollup2
WORKERS NOT HAVING VOTED.

02:33:12.216 --> 02:33:15.820 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE STATE OF THE LAW WITH

02:33:13.418 --> 02:33:17.522 region:rollup2
ANY LABOR LAW.

02:33:15.820 --> 02:33:18.089 region:rollup2

DON'T HAVE TO REVOTE EVERY YEAR

02:33:21.559 --> 02:33:25.663 region:rollup2
TO HAVE. REPRESENTATION.

02:33:24.028 --> 02:33:28.332 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS THAT ARE

02:33:25.663 --> 02:33:30.034 region:rollup2
REPRESENTED BY THEIR UNIONS DO

02:33:28.332 --> 02:33:31.469 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE TO VOTE. EVERY YEAR

02:33:30.034 --> 02:33:32.036 region:rollup2

02:33:34.272 --> 02:33:37.642 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE SAME PRINCIPLE HERE.

02:33:36.474 --> 02:33:39.110 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT

02:33:37.642 --> 02:33:40.678 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZES THAT WHEN EMPLOYEES

FORCING THEM TO OR SUPPORTING

02:33:48.319 --> 02:33:51.155 region:rollup2

SO MOTION IS IS A MOTION AND A

02:39:24.288 --> 02:39:26.390 region:rollup2
SECOND ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION

NOTHING IN THIS BILL PREVENTS A

02:39:33.130 --> 02:39:36.801 region:rollup2
UNION FROM FILING UNFAIR LABOR

02:39:35.433 --> 02:39:38.602 region:rollup2

FAILING TO NEGOTIATE.

02:39:38.602 --> 02:39:41.072 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IF INSTEAD OF

02:39:39.437 --> 02:39:42.740 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATING.

02:39:41.072 --> 02:39:44.508 region:rollup2
THE UNION DOES IN FACT DISAPPEAR

02:39:42.740 --> 02:39:46.277 region:rollup2
FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

02:39:44.508 --> 02:39:47.778 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY FAILS TO FILE AN UNFAIR

02:39:46.277 --> 02:39:50.014 region:rollup2
LABOR PRACTICE CHARGE WHICH HAS

02:39:47.778 --> 02:39:52.016 region:rollup2
BEEN GOING ON IN THIS CASE.

02:39:50.014 --> 02:39:54.485 region:rollup2

02:39:52.016 --> 02:39:55.052 region:rollup2
THE THAT INTO THE FIELDS TO

02:39:54.485 --> 02:39:56.720 region:rollup2

02:40:01.926 --> 02:40:04.595 region:rollup2
THESE REALLY ARE THAT THESE ARE

02:40:03.494 --> 02:40:06.530 region:rollup2
ACTS OF THE BAND AND BY ANY

02:40:04.595 --> 02:40:07.097 region:rollup2
DEFINITION.

02:40:06.530 --> 02:40:08.299 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE NOTHING IN THE

02:40:07.097 --> 02:40:11.102 region:rollup2
BILL.

02:40:08.299 --> 02:40:13.137 region:rollup2
SAYS THAT THE UNION CANNOT TRY

02:40:11.102 --> 02:40:15.306 region:rollup2
TO WIN BACK THOSE EMPLOYEES.

02:40:13.137 --> 02:40:17.408 region:rollup2
IN ANOTHER ELECTION.

02:40:15.306 --> 02:40:18.943 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS BILL DOES DO?

ATTACK THOSE WORKERS WHOSE

02:40:18.943 --> 02:40:23.380 region:rollup2
UNIONS HAVE ABANDONED THEM FOR

02:40:20.744 --> 02:40:24.915 region:rollup2
THREE OR MORE YEARS HAS DEFINED.

02:40:23.380 --> 02:40:28.486 region:rollup2
IN THE VERY LANGUAGE OF THE ALE

02:40:24.915 --> 02:40:29.019 region:rollup2
I BE THAT I CITED AND THE.

02:40:28.486 --> 02:40:30.955 region:rollup2
SPECIFIED FAILURES IN MANY

02:40:29.019 --> 02:40:33.090 region:rollup2
CASES.

02:40:30.955 --> 02:40:34.625 region:rollup2
.

02:40:33.090 --> 02:40:36.660 region:rollup2
OF UP OF SHOWING UP AND DOING

02:40:34.625 --> 02:40:38.162 region:rollup2
THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF THAT THEY

02:40:36.660 --> 02:40:40.498 region:rollup2
WERE ELECTED TO DO TWENTY ODD

02:40:38.162 --> 02:40:42.399 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO SO AT SOME POINT THE

02:40:40.498 --> 02:40:43.267 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.

02:40:42.399 --> 02:40:45.703 region:rollup2
IN AN ABANDONED.

02:40:43.267 --> 02:40:46.303 region:rollup2

02:40:45.703 --> 02:40:47.905 region:rollup2
WHEN THE BARGAINING UNIT HAS

WHATEVER REASON.

02:40:49.974 --> 02:40:53.244 region:rollup2
SO IN THESE RARE CASES AND WE'RE

02:40:52.009 --> 02:40:54.979 region:rollup2
ADMITTING THESE ARE RARE BUT

02:40:53.244 --> 02:40:55.946 region:rollup2
THEY DO EXIST.

02:40:54.979 --> 02:40:57.681 region:rollup2
THE LAW SHOULD ALLOW THE

02:40:55.946 --> 02:40:59.316 region:rollup2
ELLERBEE TO DETERMINE THAT A

02:40:57.681 --> 02:41:00.651 region:rollup2
BAND THAT HAS OCCURRED.

02:40:59.316 --> 02:41:01.218 region:rollup2

WE SUPPORT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

RIGHT.

02:46:26.143 --> 02:46:28.645 region:rollup2
WHAT COLLECTED PARTY SHOULD BE

ABOUT THIS.

02:46:32.182 --> 02:46:34.685 region:rollup2

AND IN ANOTHER CASE FOR OVER

02:46:36.620 --> 02:46:40.324 region:rollup2
FORTY YEARS.

02:46:38.255 --> 02:46:41.325 region:rollup2
WHY HAS THERE BEEN A CONTRACT?

02:46:40.324 --> 02:46:42.292 region:rollup2
WHY HAVEN'T THEY COLLECTED THREE

02:46:41.325 --> 02:46:45.062 region:rollup2

FARM WORKERS IN OPPOSITION TO A.

B. THIRTY NINETY THREE. I DID

02:49:33.563 --> 02:49:36.133 region:rollup2
WANT TO ONCE AGAIN CORRECT A

02:49:34.131 --> 02:49:37.267 region:rollup2
FEW.

02:49:36.133 --> 02:49:39.069 region:rollup2
MISSTATEMENTS.

02:49:37.267 --> 02:49:40.837 region:rollup2
.

02:49:39.069 --> 02:49:42.506 region:rollup2
FARMWORKERS DO HAVE A SAY IN

02:49:40.837 --> 02:49:44.307 region:rollup2
WHAT IS NEGOTIATED AND THAT'S

02:49:42.506 --> 02:49:45.876 region:rollup2
THROUGH A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED

02:49:44.307 --> 02:49:47.677 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE THAT.

02:49:45.876 --> 02:49:49.046 region:rollup2
AT LEAST

02:49:47.677 --> 02:49:50.714 region:rollup2
THE UNITED FARM WORKERS AND I

02:49:49.046 --> 02:49:52.115 region:rollup2
KNOW OTHER UNIONS USE.

02:49:50.714 --> 02:49:54.051 region:rollup2
IT'S A COMMITTEE COMPOSED OF

02:49:52.115 --> 02:49:55.752 region:rollup2
WORKERS WHO INFORMED THEIR

02:49:54.051 --> 02:49:56.920 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVE WHAT KIND OF

02:49:55.752 --> 02:49:58.422 region:rollup2
ISSUES THEY WANT ADDRESS THAT

02:49:56.920 --> 02:49:59.756 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.

02:49:58.422 --> 02:50:01.391 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT SO THE IDEA THAT FARM

02:49:59.756 --> 02:50:03.060 region:rollup2
WORKERS HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS

02:50:01.391 --> 02:50:04.795 region:rollup2
BEING NEGOTIATED SIMPLY FALSE.

02:50:03.060 --> 02:50:06.563 region:rollup2
.

02:50:04.795 --> 02:50:07.631 region:rollup2
THE IDEA THAT FARMWORKERS AT

02:50:06.563 --> 02:50:09.399 region:rollup2
THIS PARTICULAR COMPANY

02:50:07.631 --> 02:50:10.734 region:rollup2
CORRALLING FARMS DID NOT KNOW

02:50:09.399 --> 02:50:12.469 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS KNOWS NEGOTIATED IT IS

02:50:10.734 --> 02:50:13.603 region:rollup2
ALSO FALSE

02:50:12.469 --> 02:50:15.572 region:rollup2
THE FARM WORKERS KNOW VERY WELL.

02:50:13.603 --> 02:50:17.808 region:rollup2
COPIES OF THE.

02:50:15.572 --> 02:50:19.142 region:rollup2
OPPOSED MEDIATED AGREEMENT HAVE

02:50:17.808 --> 02:50:20.877 region:rollup2
BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO THE WORKERS

02:50:19.142 --> 02:50:24.314 region:rollup2
SO THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S IN

02:50:20.877 --> 02:50:26.650 region:rollup2
THE CONTRACT WAS NEGOTIATED.

02:50:24.314 --> 02:50:28.218 region:rollup2
THE IDEA THAT THIS OP MEDIATED

02:50:26.650 --> 02:50:29.953 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT LOWERED PAY.

02:50:28.218 --> 02:50:31.154 region:rollup2
SIMPLY FALSE THE MEDIATED

02:50:29.953 --> 02:50:32.722 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT CALLED FOR WAGE

02:50:31.154 --> 02:50:33.957 region:rollup2
INCREASES

02:50:32.722 --> 02:50:35.625 region:rollup2
ABOVE AND BEYOND ANY THREE

02:50:33.957 --> 02:50:37.828 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

02:50:35.625 --> 02:50:38.795 region:rollup2
ONE OF AROUND FARMS COMPLAINTS

02:50:37.828 --> 02:50:40.230 region:rollup2
IS THAT IT WAS BEING ASKED TO

02:50:38.795 --> 02:50:41.932 region:rollup2
PAY TOO MUCH.

02:50:40.230 --> 02:50:44.468 region:rollup2
OVER AND ABOVE BEYOND THREE

02:50:41.932 --> 02:50:45.669 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

02:50:44.468 --> 02:50:47.537 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO GIVE WORKERS

02:50:45.669 --> 02:50:48.472 region:rollup2
INCREASED WAGES.

02:50:47.537 --> 02:50:49.673 region:rollup2
AGAIN THOSE THINGS ARE ALSO

02:50:48.472 --> 02:50:50.974 region:rollup2
FALLS.

02:50:49.673 --> 02:50:52.976 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO.

02:50:50.974 --> 02:50:55.145 region:rollup2
LEGAL.

02:50:52.976 --> 02:50:55.679 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO RATIFY A CONTRACT

02:50:55.145 --> 02:50:57.647 region:rollup2
THAT'S A THAT'S SOMETHING

02:50:55.679 --> 02:50:59.249 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

02:50:57.647 --> 02:51:01.017 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED AMONG

02:50:59.249 --> 02:51:02.486 region:rollup2
THE UNIONS IT'S AN INTERNAL

02:51:01.017 --> 02:51:03.820 region:rollup2
PROCEDURE THAT'S SOMETIMES

02:51:02.486 --> 02:51:05.388 region:rollup2
AFFORDED TO MEMBERS SOMETIMES A

02:51:03.820 --> 02:51:07.491 region:rollup2
SUPPORTED TO COMMITTEES WHAT THE

02:51:05.388 --> 02:51:09.559 region:rollup2
LAW SAYS. IF THAT THE UNIONS

02:51:07.491 --> 02:51:10.393 region:rollup2
HAVE A RIGHT TO DETERMINE HOW TO

02:51:09.559 --> 02:51:14.331 region:rollup2
DO THAT WITHIN THEIR OWN

02:51:10.393 --> 02:51:16.333 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION.

02:51:14.331 --> 02:51:17.868 region:rollup2
AGAIN WITH RESPECT TO THIS

02:51:16.333 --> 02:51:19.903 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC EMPLOYER. THE IDEA THAT

02:51:17.868 --> 02:51:21.471 region:rollup2
IT.

02:51:19.903 --> 02:51:23.173 region:rollup2
IT WAS PAYING THE HIGHEST WAGES

02:51:21.471 --> 02:51:24.975 region:rollup2
IN THE INDUSTRY IS LAUGHABLE

02:51:23.173 --> 02:51:26.910 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS BEING SUED FOR

02:51:24.975 --> 02:51:28.578 region:rollup2
MINIMUM WAGE VIOLATIONS.

02:51:26.910 --> 02:51:30.614 region:rollup2
AND HAS NOT PAID THE HIGHEST

02:51:28.578 --> 02:51:32.849 region:rollup2
WAGES IN THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE OF

02:51:30.614 --> 02:51:36.086 region:rollup2
THESE MINIMUM WAGE VIOLATIONS.

02:51:32.849 --> 02:51:39.055 region:rollup2
SO ONCE AGAIN THERE IS NO NEED.

02:51:36.086 --> 02:51:40.757 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO RIGHT LEGAL RIGHT FOR

02:51:39.055 --> 02:51:42.092 region:rollup2
WHAT IS BEING ASKED FOR HERE.

02:51:40.757 --> 02:51:43.627 region:rollup2
IT'S ANOTHER WAY FOR THE

02:51:42.092 --> 02:51:45.762 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER TO INTERFERE WITH THE

02:51:43.627 --> 02:51:47.063 region:rollup2
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THIS EMPLOYER

02:51:45.762 --> 02:51:48.365 region:rollup2
WAS ALREADY FOUND TO HAVE

02:51:47.063 --> 02:51:49.766 region:rollup2
INTERFERED WITH THE RIGHT OF

02:51:48.365 --> 02:51:52.135 region:rollup2
THESE EMPLOYEES.

02:51:49.766 --> 02:51:53.870 region:rollup2
SELECT OR NOT SELECT THE UNION A

02:51:52.135 --> 02:51:55.772 region:rollup2
SECOND VOTE WOULD ADD AN ADDED

02:51:53.870 --> 02:51:57.274 region:rollup2
HURDLE AT GETTING A COLLECTIVE

02:51:55.772 --> 02:51:58.408 region:rollup2
BARGAINING AGREEMENT THAT THE

02:51:57.274 --> 02:51:59.709 region:rollup2

ONLY THINK THIS ACTION WITH THE

02:52:18.595 --> 02:52:21.698 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS ENGAGED IN.

02:52:20.263 --> 02:52:23.333 region:rollup2
UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE AT THE

02:58:36.539 --> 02:58:37.907 region:rollup2
THE TIMES WHEN WE WERE GOING

02:58:37.440 --> 02:58:40.743 region:rollup2

WERE NOT ALLOWED IN THE ROOM.

02:58:44.447 --> 02:58:46.716 region:rollup2

WAS.

02:58:48.351 --> 02:58:51.487 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT THE LRB BOARD

02:58:48.918 --> 02:58:54.824 region:rollup2

02:58:51.487 --> 02:58:56.926 region:rollup2
THAT JUST AMONGST THEMSELVES.

02:58:54.824 --> 02:58:58.695 region:rollup2

02:58:56.926 --> 02:59:00.330 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE THE THE THIRD LARGEST

02:58:58.695 --> 02:59:02.298 region:rollup2
STEAK.

02:59:00.330 --> 02:59:04.300 region:rollup2
IN THE DECISIONS THAT WERE BEING

THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE

02:59:23.219 --> 02:59:25.622 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE DETAILS.

02:59:24.754 --> 02:59:26.623 region:rollup2
NOW THEY DON'T HAVE AN

02:59:25.622 --> 02:59:28.491 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT IT STUDY

02:59:26.623 --> 02:59:29.392 region:rollup2
IT.

02:59:28.491 --> 02:59:31.694 region:rollup2

OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON IT.

02:59:31.694 --> 02:59:35.932 region:rollup2

02:59:33.896 --> 02:59:39.102 region:rollup2
REAL A DEPARTURE FROM I THINK

02:59:35.932 --> 02:59:39.702 region:rollup2
GENERAL. UP PRACTICE AND

02:59:39.102 --> 02:59:41.604 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY I THINK IT DOES CALL

INTO.

02:59:41.604 --> 02:59:44.807 region:rollup2
SOME QUESTION.

02:59:42.672 --> 02:59:47.110 region:rollup2
AT BUT WHETHER OR NOT THESE

02:59:44.807 --> 02:59:49.078 region:rollup2

I MEAN IF AND FUND A FATHER UP.

03:00:00.223 --> 03:00:04.127 region:rollup2
UNIONS AND UNION MEMBERS HAVE

03:00:01.991 --> 03:00:05.228 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT TO SEE THE CONTRACT.

03:00:04.127 --> 03:00:05.728 region:rollup2

IN THE ROOM.

03:00:08.064 --> 03:00:11.601 region:rollup2
SO THERE THERE IT WAS A.

03:00:10.800 --> 03:00:13.603 region:rollup2
THE FACT THOUGH MANDATORY.

03:00:11.601 --> 03:00:15.405 region:rollup2

CONTRACTS.

03:00:21.177 --> 03:00:23.946 region:rollup2

03:00:23.946 --> 03:00:26.949 region:rollup2

THIS IS AG.

03:00:45.134 --> 03:00:47.470 region:rollup2

BARGAINING UNIT.

03:03:01.003 --> 03:03:04.607 region:rollup2
IF EMPLOYER MISCONDUCT IS FOUND

03:03:03.372 --> 03:03:06.509 region:rollup2
THAT MAY HAVE INTERFERED WITH

03:03:04.607 --> 03:03:09.512 region:rollup2
THE VOTE.

03:03:06.509 --> 03:03:11.881 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THERE IS NO RECOURSE IF

ELECTION IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR

03:03:19.922 --> 03:03:24.093 region:rollup2
SO IN FACT THERE IS NOT.

03:03:21.924 --> 03:03:25.094 region:rollup2
EVEN A JUDICIAL REVIEW

03:03:24.093 --> 03:03:26.529 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE WITHIN THE APPELLATE

03:03:25.094 --> 03:03:28.364 region:rollup2

HAVE ALREADY VOTED AND THOSE

03:03:39.609 --> 03:03:43.412 region:rollup2
BOATS ARE SEQUESTERED THEY'RE IN

03:03:41.711 --> 03:03:44.881 region:rollup2
A BOX SOMEPLACE IN THE THAT

03:03:43.412 --> 03:03:45.414 region:rollup2

COUNTED.

03:03:46.315 --> 03:03:50.753 region:rollup2
SO THAT RIGHT TO CHOOSE EMPLOYEE

03:03:48.751 --> 03:03:52.455 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATION IS REALLY CREPT

03:03:50.753 --> 03:03:53.923 region:rollup2

03:14:59.922 --> 03:15:03.692 region:rollup2
THE FACT IS IF WE DON'T ACCOUNT

TO BE REPRESENTED BY THE UNION

03:19:00.862 --> 03:19:04.232 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE STEPS THEY CAN

03:19:02.063 --> 03:19:04.866 region:rollup2

UNION.

03:19:14.242 --> 03:19:17.679 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY I WENT TO THE NLRB TO

03:19:16.178 --> 03:19:19.881 region:rollup2
ASK FOR ANOTHER ACTION.

03:19:17.679 --> 03:19:20.949 region:rollup2

MIGHT BE INDIVIDUALS WHO JUST

03:19:34.296 --> 03:19:37.265 region:rollup2

I DO NOT THINK IT IS ACCURATE.

03:22:32.474 --> 03:22:35.110 region:rollup2
FOR YOU TO SAY.

03:22:34.376 --> 03:22:36.878 region:rollup2

AND SPIRITED COMMENTS RACE.

03:22:56.498 --> 03:22:59.801 region:rollup2
BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT'S

03:22:57.999 --> 03:23:02.404 region:rollup2
ACCURATE TO SAY THAT ANYONE IN

THIS CHAMBER HAS IMPUGNED ANYONE

03:23:02.404 --> 03:23:06.875 region:rollup2

03:23:14.949 --> 03:23:17.585 region:rollup2

THE OPPOSITION.

03:23:27.028 --> 03:23:28.997 region:rollup2
IT'S SAD THAT THIS IS

03:23:27.762 --> 03:23:31.132 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARY.

03:23:28.997 --> 03:23:32.734 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S.

03:23:31.132 --> 03:23:35.203 region:rollup2
LAW THERE'S PENALTIES FOR

03:23:32.734 --> 03:23:37.405 region:rollup2
MISCONDUCT BY ALL PARTIES.

03:23:35.203 --> 03:23:38.907 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

03:23:37.405 --> 03:23:40.875 region:rollup2
SECTION ELEVEN FIFTY SIX POINT

03:23:38.907 --> 03:23:43.545 region:rollup2

EMPLOYER MISCONDUCT

03:23:45.380 --> 03:23:49.551 region:rollup2

03:23:56.291 --> 03:23:59.994 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN THE EMPLOYER.

03:23:58.793 --> 03:24:01.563 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS TO ME INTHIS COUNTRY

03:23:59.994 --> 03:24:02.030 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE THAT WE UNDERSTAND

03:24:01.563 --> 03:24:04.265 region:rollup2
SOME VERY FUNDAMENTAL

03:24:02.030 --> 03:24:05.266 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLES.

03:24:04.265 --> 03:24:06.634 region:rollup2
OUT OF OF RIGHTS THAT

03:24:05.266 --> 03:24:08.703 region:rollup2

ABILITY TO SEEK REDRESS THROUGH

03:24:19.981 --> 03:24:26.054 region:rollup2
A JUDICIAL SYSTEM.

03:24:21.850 --> 03:24:27.822 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HAVE BEEN WRONG.

03:24:27.822 --> 03:24:29.791 region:rollup2
EXTEND THOSE RIGHTS TO

03:24:28.690 --> 03:24:31.359 region:rollup2
FARMWORKERS BECAUSE THAT'S

03:24:29.791 --> 03:24:32.026 region:rollup2
WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE.

FOR THIS KIND. OF SOLUTION

03:24:35.930 --> 03:24:40.335 region:rollup2

03:49:58.852 --> 03:50:01.955 region:rollup2
LOOKED INTO THAT CASE AND IT WAS

03:50:00.387 --> 03:50:03.523 region:rollup2
A SAFETY BONUS IN THERE WAS.

03:50:01.955 --> 03:50:05.191 region:rollup2

04:25:17.735 --> 04:25:20.872 region:rollup2
SCHOOL IS THEN PASSED IS REALLY

04:25:19.337 --> 04:25:22.440 region:rollup2
BENEFIT THAT'S PASSED ON TO THE

04:25:20.872 --> 04:25:24.308 region:rollup2
STUDENT WHICH IS.

04:25:22.440 --> 04:25:25.777 region:rollup2
THE LOWER COST AVAILABLE OF THE

04:25:24.308 --> 04:25:27.378 region:rollup2
MONEY AVAILABLE TO FINANCE

04:25:25.777 --> 04:25:28.413 region:rollup2
SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION.

04:25:27.378 --> 04:25:29.781 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE PAY THAT LOWER

04:25:28.413 --> 04:25:31.315 region:rollup2
INTEREST RATE OR WHEN WE GET

04:25:29.781 --> 04:25:32.617 region:rollup2
THAT MONEY CHEAPER.

04:25:31.315 --> 04:25:34.185 region:rollup2
THE BENEFIT THAT WE GET IS

04:25:32.617 --> 04:25:35.453 region:rollup2
PASSED ON TO THE STUDENT IN

04:25:34.185 --> 04:25:36.521 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO BUILD MORE

04:25:35.453 --> 04:25:38.156 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS OR A BIGGER OR BETTER

04:25:36.521 --> 04:25:39.624 region:rollup2
CAMPUS.

04:25:38.156 --> 04:25:41.092 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT THE OFFSET

04:25:39.624 --> 04:25:42.260 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE SEEKING HERE WITH

04:25:41.092 --> 04:25:44.061 region:rollup2
THE PREVAILING WAGES IS

04:25:42.260 --> 04:25:45.463 region:rollup2
SHIFTING.

04:25:44.061 --> 04:25:47.899 region:rollup2
THAT BENEFIT AWAY FROM THE

04:25:45.463 --> 04:25:48.433 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AND ONTO THE FINE MEN

04:25:47.899 --> 04:25:49.634 region:rollup2
AND WOMEN WHO WERE IN THE

04:25:48.433 --> 04:25:51.702 region:rollup2
BUILDING TRADES WHICH.

04:25:49.634 --> 04:25:52.770 region:rollup2
WE FEEL YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD

04:25:51.702 --> 04:25:54.939 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY BE COMPENSATED IN THE

04:25:52.770 --> 04:25:55.807 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE SITUATIONS.

04:25:54.939 --> 04:25:57.008 region:rollup2
WE DON'T THINK THIS IS ONE OF

04:25:55.807 --> 04:25:58.342 region:rollup2
THOSE APPROPRIATE SITUATIONS

04:25:57.008 --> 04:25:59.944 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT COMES AT THE EXPENSE

04:25:58.342 --> 04:26:01.512 region:rollup2
OF THE STUDENTS AND THE

04:25:59.944 --> 04:26:03.414 region:rollup2
FACILITIES THAT WOULD BE BUILT.

04:26:01.512 --> 04:26:05.683 region:rollup2
WITHOUT MONEY WERE IT TO BE AT

04:26:03.414 --> 04:26:06.951 region:rollup2
THE LOWER COST SO THAT IS OUR

04:26:05.683 --> 04:26:09.086 region:rollup2
MAIN OBJECTIVE I THINK OUR MAIN

04:26:06.951 --> 04:26:09.654 region:rollup2
OBJECTION. I THINK THE OTHER

04:26:09.086 --> 04:26:10.755 region:rollup2
THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS IS

04:26:09.654 --> 04:26:11.756 region:rollup2
THAT.

04:26:10.755 --> 04:26:13.090 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

04:26:11.756 --> 04:26:14.792 region:rollup2
CHARTER SCHOOLS THESE ARE NOT

04:26:13.090 --> 04:26:16.627 region:rollup2

04:26:14.792 --> 04:26:18.396 region:rollup2

EDUCATE STUDENTS AND THE SAVINGS

04:26:29.941 --> 04:26:34.178 region:rollup2

INTEREST RATES AGAIN ARE. GIVEN

04:26:34.178 --> 04:26:37.782 region:rollup2

TO BETTER FACILITIES AND SO

04:26:37.782 --> 04:26:41.686 region:rollup2

OUR COURT OR BY STATE AGENCIES

04:29:29.553 --> 04:29:32.056 region:rollup2

MANDATING THAT EMPLOYEES GO TO

04:29:45.603 --> 04:29:48.305 region:rollup2
ARBITRATION IS A PRACTICE THAT

04:29:47.004 --> 04:29:49.640 region:rollup2
ALLOWS COMPANIES TO FORCE

04:29:48.305 --> 04:29:51.542 region:rollup2

A FREELY.

04:30:03.220 --> 04:30:05.890 region:rollup2
IT'S FAR LESS SUCCESSFUL WHEN

RESOLVE WORKPLACE DISPUTES BUT

04:30:14.999 --> 04:30:17.668 region:rollup2
INSTEAD IT SIMPLY REQUIRES THAT

04:30:16.634 --> 04:30:19.370 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES CHOOSE TO SIGN SUCH

04:30:17.668 --> 04:30:20.738 region:rollup2
AGREEMENTS.

AGREEMENTS UNENFORCEABLE.

04:30:24.141 --> 04:30:26.977 region:rollup2
IT SIMPLY PROVIDES INJUNCTIVE

04:30:25.209 --> 04:30:28.546 region:rollup2
RELIEF WHEN PLAYERS ARE FORCING

04:30:26.977 --> 04:30:31.015 region:rollup2

ACTUALLY. ARBITRATION HEARING

04:45:09.059 --> 04:45:12.929 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS A MORE OPEN FORUM

04:45:11.227 --> 04:45:14.264 region:rollup2
WITH MORE INFORMATION THAT'S

04:45:12.929 --> 04:45:15.599 region:rollup2
PROVIDED IN COURT THERE'S ALWAYS

04:45:14.264 --> 04:45:17.834 region:rollup2
A DISCUSSION THAT THEY NEED

04:45:15.599 --> 04:45:19.269 region:rollup2
THEIR DAY IN COURT. IN IN NINETY

04:45:17.834 --> 04:45:20.670 region:rollup2

INDIVIDUAL NEVER ACTUALLY SEES

04:45:21.838 --> 04:45:24.574 region:rollup2
THE COURTROOM IF IT'S A CLASS

04:45:22.906 --> 04:45:25.175 region:rollup2
ACTION THERE'S EVEN LESS CHANCE

04:45:24.574 --> 04:45:27.077 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO A

04:45:25.175 --> 04:45:28.178 region:rollup2
COURTROOM. SO ARBITRATION

04:45:27.077 --> 04:45:29.746 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAS A MORE OPEN AND

04:45:28.178 --> 04:45:31.047 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENT PROCESS WITH REGARDS

04:45:29.746 --> 04:45:33.650 region:rollup2
TO THE INFORMATION AND THE

04:45:31.047 --> 04:45:34.217 region:rollup2
PARTIES INVOLVED THEN DOES I'M

04:45:33.650 --> 04:45:35.218 region:rollup2
OUR COURT SYSTEM RIGHT NOW.

04:45:34.217 --> 04:45:36.419 region:rollup2
THE OTHER POINT THAT HAS BEEN

04:45:35.218 --> 04:45:36.987 region:rollup2
RAISED A COUPLE OF TIMES AND I

04:45:36.419 --> 04:45:37.954 region:rollup2
THINK IN THE FACT SHEET WAS

04:45:36.987 --> 04:45:39.689 region:rollup2
THAT.

04:45:37.954 --> 04:45:41.725 region:rollup2
THAT THE ARBITRATION.

04:45:39.689 --> 04:45:43.159 region:rollup2
WEEPY THE ARBITRATORS AND SO

04:45:41.725 --> 04:45:44.861 region:rollup2
HOT SOMEHOW IT'S A BIAS SYSTEM

04:45:43.159 --> 04:45:46.696 region:rollup2
UP THE LAW SAYS THAT COMPANIES

04:45:44.861 --> 04:45:47.364 region:rollup2
HAVE TO PAY FOR ARBITRATION IF

04:45:46.696 --> 04:45:49.132 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A.

04:45:47.364 --> 04:45:50.066 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO SPLIT THE FEES

04:45:49.132 --> 04:45:52.168 region:rollup2
COMPANIES WOULD BE HAPPY TO

04:45:50.066 --> 04:45:52.636 region:rollup2
SHARE THE FEES BUT BY LIVE WERE

04:45:52.168 --> 04:45:53.737 region:rollup2
FORCED TO PAY FOR THE

04:45:52.636 --> 04:45:55.405 region:rollup2
ARBITRATION.

04:45:53.737 --> 04:45:57.240 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE ARBITRATORS ARE

04:45:55.405 --> 04:45:58.341 region:rollup2
RETIRED JUDGES ON THERE'S ALWAYS

04:45:57.240 --> 04:45:59.709 region:rollup2
A DISCUSSION ABOUT A RIGHT TO

04:45:58.341 --> 04:46:00.844 region:rollup2
APPEAL THE ALLOWED FORTY SETS

04:45:59.709 --> 04:46:02.112 region:rollup2
FORTH THE GROUNDS FROM WHICH YOU

04:46:00.844 --> 04:46:04.280 region:rollup2
CAN APPEAL A DECISION.

04:46:02.112 --> 04:46:05.682 region:rollup2
SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WITH

04:46:04.280 --> 04:46:06.683 region:rollup2
REGARDS TO ARBITRATION OVER THE

04:46:05.682 --> 04:46:09.052 region:rollup2
LAST POINT ON THE ARBITRATOR'S

THANK YOU I'M IN ARBITRATION

04:46:09.052 --> 04:46:11.321 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO A REQUIREMENT IN

04:46:10.253 --> 04:46:13.156 region:rollup2
THE QUIKSILVER SEIZURE THAT THE

04:46:11.321 --> 04:46:14.658 region:rollup2
ARBITRATOR BEFORE THEY EVEN GET

04:46:13.156 --> 04:46:16.159 region:rollup2
PICKED TO BE AN ARBITRATOR.

04:46:14.658 --> 04:46:17.193 region:rollup2
HOUSE TO DISCLOSE BASICALLY

04:46:16.159 --> 04:46:18.561 region:rollup2
EVERY RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY

04:46:17.193 --> 04:46:19.362 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY COULD HAVE HAD WITH

04:46:18.561 --> 04:46:20.764 region:rollup2
ANYBODY INVOLVED IN THE

04:46:19.362 --> 04:46:22.599 region:rollup2
ARBITRATION IF THEY HAVE.

04:46:20.764 --> 04:46:23.967 region:rollup2
HAD A CASE IN WHICH THE COMPANY

04:46:22.599 --> 04:46:25.668 region:rollup2
WAS INVOLVED IN THE ARBITRATION

04:46:23.967 --> 04:46:26.669 region:rollup2
HOW THEY DECIDED THAT CASE

04:46:25.668 --> 04:46:28.004 region:rollup2
THAT'S AN UNDERGOING DISCLOSURE

04:46:26.669 --> 04:46:29.606 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS AGAIN THOSE SAME

04:46:28.004 --> 04:46:31.374 region:rollup2
DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT

04:46:29.606 --> 04:46:32.442 region:rollup2
REQUIRED FOR JUDGES SO A JUDGE

04:46:31.374 --> 04:46:34.344 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE DECIDED THE CASE FOR

04:46:32.442 --> 04:46:35.278 region:rollup2
A COMPANY THE DAY BEFORE. AND

04:46:34.344 --> 04:46:36.479 region:rollup2
THE PLANE OF COMING INTO THAT

04:46:35.278 --> 04:46:37.313 region:rollup2
CASE NEXT THEY WOULD NEVER KNOW

04:46:36.479 --> 04:46:39.315 region:rollup2
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME

04:46:37.313 --> 04:46:41.084 region:rollup2
DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS SO AGAIN

04:46:39.315 --> 04:46:41.951 region:rollup2
ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE THAT

04:46:41.084 --> 04:46:43.353 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN RAISED I DON'T THINK

04:46:41.951 --> 04:46:45.021 region:rollup2
ARE. RELEVANT WITH REGARDS TO

ACTUALLY ENCOURAGES SETTLEMENT

04:48:09.272 --> 04:48:13.176 region:rollup2
THAT REDUCES CONFLICT.

04:48:11.107 --> 04:48:14.511 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AMICALE AMICABLE

04:48:13.176 --> 04:48:16.312 region:rollup2

THIS LEGISLATURE BUT WE WORK

CLOSELY WITH A BUSINESS GROUP WE

05:21:11.319 --> 05:21:14.155 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT A

VERIFICATION ISSUES.

05:21:28.503 --> 05:21:31.539 region:rollup2
AND WE WE FEEL THAT THOSE

05:21:30.104 --> 05:21:32.140 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS WERE NECESSARY AND

05:21:31.539 --> 05:21:33.641 region:rollup2
THAT WERE.

05:21:32.140 --> 05:21:35.309 region:rollup2
ALLOWABLE UNDER BOTH STATE AND

THE ABILITY TO A REGULATE CLEAR

05:21:37.178 --> 05:21:39.881 region:rollup2

05:21:42.250 --> 05:21:44.719 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T AGAIN REGULATE

EMPLOYER BEHAVIOR TO ENSURE THAT

05:22:00.735 --> 05:22:04.338 region:rollup2
IT PUTS WORKERS IN DANGER OF THE

05:22:02.870 --> 05:22:05.673 region:rollup2
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS

05:22:04.338 --> 05:22:07.642 region:rollup2
WHERE WE KNOW IN THE PAST THAT

SUCH RATES HAVE CAUSED.

05:22:07.642 --> 05:22:10.144 region:rollup2
