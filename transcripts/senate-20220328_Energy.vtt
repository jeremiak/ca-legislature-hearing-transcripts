00:09:04.744 --> 00:09:06.045
FLEXIBILITY IN THOSE

00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:07.813
CIRCUMSTANCES THEN THE

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.482
CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION

00:09:09.548 --> 00:09:10.883

DECARBONIZING CALIFORNIA'S

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:25.564
OF OUR OVERALL GREENHOUSE GAS

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:29.568

TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FINANCIAL

BURDEN TO OUR UNDERSERVED

00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:44.116

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:45.685
TO HANDLE THESE ORDINANCES WHICH

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:48.621

RESPONSIBILITY AND A ROLE TO

00:25:53.852 --> 00:25:56.454
REDUCE EMISSIONS 40% BY TWENTY

00:25:56.521 --> 00:25:59.257
THIRTY AS OUR GOALS- BUT RATHER

00:25:59.324 --> 00:26:03.628
THAN- THE YOU KNOW THE KIND OF

00:26:03.695 --> 00:26:05.530
AB EMBRACE THIS EXPERIMENTAL

00:26:05.597 --> 00:26:07.499
APPROACH WITH THIS BILL WOULD DO

00:26:07.565 --> 00:26:08.566
WOULD CREATE A LITIGATION

00:26:08.633 --> 00:26:10.535
NIGHTMARE AND EFFECTIVE PREVENT

00:26:10.602 --> 00:26:12.704
ANY NEW BUILDING DECARBONIZATION

00:26:12.771 --> 00:26:14.806
MEASURES OF THE LOCAL LEVEL. THE

00:26:14.873 --> 00:26:17.309
BILL GIVES VAST NEW APPROVAL

00:26:17.375 --> 00:26:19.377
AUTHORITIES TO THE CC OVER ANY

00:26:19.444 --> 00:26:21.346
KIND OF LOCAL ROLE EVEN THAT

00:26:21.413 --> 00:26:24.282
LOCALLY PASSED BALLOT MEASURES.

00:26:24.349 --> 00:26:25.350
AND PREVENTS THE CDC FROM

00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:27.652
APPROVING ANY LOCAL REQUIREMENT

00:26:27.719 --> 00:26:29.621
THAT CROSSES ANY OF A LIST

00:26:29.688 --> 00:26:33.158
VAGUELY DEFINED OUTLINES SO I

00:26:33.224 --> 00:26:36.027
DO. A YOU KNOW ONE STRONGLY

00:26:36.094 --> 00:26:37.996
RAISE MY CONCERNS I DO WANT TO.

00:26:38.063 --> 00:26:39.397
SAY I THINK THE AUTHOR RAISES

00:26:39.464 --> 00:26:41.299
SOME VALID ISSUES WITH THE BILL

00:26:41.366 --> 00:26:43.835
I THINK IN THEIR ENTHUSIASM FOR

00:26:43.902 --> 00:26:45.003
TAKING ACTION ON CLIMATE SOME

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.571
CITIES. MAIN ACT ORTON SAYS THAT

00:26:46.638 --> 00:26:48.573
OVER REACH. AND THEY MAY NOT

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.674
REALIZE THAT EXEMPTIONS FOR

00:26:49.741 --> 00:26:50.542
CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF BUILDINGS

00:26:50.608 --> 00:26:51.910
ARE CERTAIN USE CASES ARE

00:26:51.977 --> 00:26:53.645
JUSTIFIED AT LEAST TEMPORARILY.

00:26:53.712 --> 00:26:54.946
BECAUSE RECENTLY COST EFFECTIVE

00:26:55.013 --> 00:26:56.247
LECTURES OPTIONS ARE NOT YET

00:26:56.314 --> 00:26:58.650
COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE. SO I CAN

00:26:58.717 --> 00:27:00.151
IMAGINE IN A WORKING THE FUTURE

00:27:00.218 --> 00:27:02.053
WITH THE AUTHOR ON A BILL THAT

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.089
REQUIRES A CC TO PROVIDE

00:27:04.155 --> 00:27:05.590
GUIDANCE. TO CITIES CONSIDERING

00:27:05.657 --> 00:27:07.559
DECARBONISATION ORTON SAYS AND

00:27:07.625 --> 00:27:10.528
HELPS THEM UNDERSTAND WHERE LACK

00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:11.396
OF AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY WOULD

00:27:11.463 --> 00:27:13.298
MAKE SOLUTIONS. I'M IN FEASIBLE

00:27:13.365 --> 00:27:15.834
ARE VERY EXPENSIVE ON BUT THIS

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.902
IS NOT THAT BILL AND AS IT

00:27:17.969 --> 00:27:19.404
COMMUNICATED TO THE AUTHOR I'M

00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:20.538
GOINGTO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL

00:27:20.605 --> 00:27:23.008
AND I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE MY

00:27:23.074 --> 00:27:23.541
COLLEAGUES TO JOIN ME. IN

00:27:23.608 --> 00:27:24.309
PREVENTING WHAT'S REALLY AN

00:27:24.376 --> 00:27:26.878
ATTACK ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:28.013
EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE

00:27:28.079 --> 00:27:31.416
CRISIS. OKAY DO WE HAVE ANY

00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:33.451
OTHER SPEAKERS CENTER BRADFORD.

00:27:33.518 --> 00:27:34.886
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I

00:27:34.953 --> 00:27:36.521
STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS

00:27:36.588 --> 00:27:38.490
MEASURE AS INDIVIDUAL WHO. WORK

00:27:38.556 --> 00:27:40.291
NOT ONLY FOR UTILITY OF AN

00:27:40.358 --> 00:27:41.626
ENVIRONMENTAL NONPROFIT THIS IS

00:27:41.693 --> 00:27:43.862
A COMMON SENSE APPROACH WE'VE

00:27:43.928 --> 00:27:47.899
SEEN THE- GREAT INTENTIONS. AND

00:27:47.966 --> 00:27:50.168
INTENT BY INDIVIDUALS BOTH

00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:53.271
LOCALLY. AND STATE AND FEDERAL

00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:55.473
TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS ABOUT

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.108
CLIMATE AND THEY'RE LEGIT. BUT

00:27:57.175 --> 00:27:59.644
MANY TIMES WE SET ARBITRARY

00:27:59.711 --> 00:28:01.679
LAUDABLE GOALS THAT ARE

00:28:01.746 --> 00:28:03.548
ASPIRATIONAL AT BEST IN HARD TO

00:28:03.615 --> 00:28:06.051
REACH. THE REASON WHY WE SAW SO

00:28:06.117 --> 00:28:08.186
MANY PEOPLE LOSE THEIR LIFE LIVE

00:28:08.253 --> 00:28:09.821
HERE IN TEXAS DURING THAT WINTER

00:28:09.888 --> 00:28:12.557
VORTEX. WAS TO THE FACT THOSE

00:28:12.624 --> 00:28:15.260
WERE ALL ELECTRIFIED HOMES.

00:28:15.326 --> 00:28:17.429
THOSE HOMES STILL BEEN PLUMBED

00:28:17.495 --> 00:28:19.197
FOR GAS WITH GAS BILLS

00:28:19.264 --> 00:28:20.265
INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE ALIVE

00:28:20.331 --> 00:28:21.933
TODAY. I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.735
IMPORTANT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

00:28:23.802 --> 00:28:26.071
THE ROLE THAT GAS CONTINUES TO

00:28:26.137 --> 00:28:28.473
PLAY WE WOULD NOT HAVE MET OUR

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.209
CLIMATE COLD. GOALS AS A NATION.

00:28:31.276 --> 00:28:32.844
ARE PARIS ACCORD GOALS IF IT

00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:34.979
WASN'T FOR NATURAL GAS LAST YEAR

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:38.883

PRETTY WISE OR WHATEVER THE.

00:28:45.723 --> 00:28:47.358
TERM IS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:28:47.425 --> 00:28:49.260

00:28:53.264 --> 00:28:55.100
CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION IF

00:28:55.166 --> 00:28:56.468
NOT THE WORLD AND MUCH OF WHAT

00:28:56.534 --> 00:28:59.370

SAMPSON TO JUMP IN AS WELL. THE

00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:24.255
ISSUE HERE IS ITS MUNICIPALITIES

00:30:24.322 --> 00:30:26.024
CITY GOVERNMENTS THEY CHANGE ALL

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:28.459
THE TIME. EVERY NOVEMBER EVERY

00:30:28.526 --> 00:30:31.129
FOUR YEARS WHATEVER THAT IS AND

00:30:31.196 --> 00:30:33.298
- I KNOW WE'RE ALL TRYING TO

00:30:33.364 --> 00:30:35.533
WORK ON OUR ENVIRONMENT I TOO AM

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.735
DOING THE SAME THING. I AM JUST

00:30:37.802 --> 00:30:39.938
CONCERNED ABOUT THE FAMILY WHO

00:30:40.004 --> 00:30:41.706
CAN'T AFFORD FOR SOMEONE TO

00:30:41.773 --> 00:30:44.209
KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND SAID

00:30:44.275 --> 00:30:44.842
YOU'VE GOT TO CHANGE YOUR GAS

00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:47.178
STOVE AND YOUR WAY OF EATING-

00:30:47.245 --> 00:30:50.381
INTO ELECTRIC. SYSTEM AND THEY

00:30:50.448 --> 00:30:52.450
CAN'T AFFORD IT. WILL YOU BE

00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:55.653
HEARD WHAT WAS SAID TWENTY FIVE

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.155
HUNDRED TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:30:57.222 --> 00:30:59.524
AND FOR. THIS BILL ALL IT DOES

00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:02.193
IS IF ASSUMING FOUR SQUARE

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.629
BLOCKS IN YOUR DISTRICT ARE

00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:06.998
GOING TO BE AFFECTED WELL ALL IT

00:31:07.065 --> 00:31:08.866
MEANS IS THAT THE CITY COUNCIL

00:31:08.933 --> 00:31:11.636
WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE STATE-

00:31:11.703 --> 00:31:13.371
A. N. TALK WITH THE CALIFORNIA

00:31:13.438 --> 00:31:17.075
ENERGY COMMISSION. AND THEY IN

00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:18.610
TURN WOULD OVERSEE WHAT THEY'RE

00:31:18.676 --> 00:31:19.510
DOING AND IF IT'S FOR. THEY'LL

00:31:19.577 --> 00:31:21.946
BACK IT IF IT'S NOT. THEN THEY

00:31:22.013 --> 00:31:23.715
WON'T THAT'S ALL IT IS JUST A OF

00:31:23.781 --> 00:31:26.351
THE BALANCING THE CHECKS AND

00:31:26.417 --> 00:31:29.187
BALANCES SO COMMUNITIES ARE

00:31:29.254 --> 00:31:30.288
ARBITRARILY TOLD TO DO

00:31:30.355 --> 00:31:32.757
SOMETHING. WITHOUT THE STATE

00:31:32.824 --> 00:31:35.493
ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING SO IT'S

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.328
JUST THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN

00:31:37.395 --> 00:31:39.464
THE CITY AND THE CALIFORNIA

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.499
ENERGY COMMISSION BEFORE ACTION

00:31:41.566 --> 00:31:44.068
IS TAKEN. THAT'S IT AND REMEMBER

00:31:44.135 --> 00:31:44.836
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OLDER

00:31:44.902 --> 00:31:47.538
STRUCTURES NOT NEW ONES IF

00:31:47.605 --> 00:31:49.540
THERE'S GONNA BE A BRAND YOU A

TOWN HOUSE BUILT OR BRAND NEW

00:31:51.676 --> 00:31:53.411
HOMES BUILT GRANTED. THEN

00:31:53.478 --> 00:31:55.179
BECAUSE IT'S BRAND NEW THEN THE

00:31:55.246 --> 00:31:56.981
LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES WILL

00:31:57.048 --> 00:31:58.916
PROBABLY SAY WE'D LIKE TO HAVE

00:31:58.983 --> 00:32:01.686
THOSE- WITH ELECTRIC STOVES AND

00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:03.521
SOMEONE. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:05.990
MOM AND POP AND COMMUNITIES THAT

00:32:06.057 --> 00:32:07.859

EVEN MORE SO THAN THE STATE CITY

00:33:01.045 --> 00:33:02.513
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DON'T MOVE

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:03.514
FASTER THAN THE PEOPLE THAT THEY

00:33:03.581 --> 00:33:05.083

00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:07.285
CLOSEST TO IT. AND I CERTAINLY

DOWN THE PROGRESS THAT IS GOING

TO BE VERY DIFFICULT WE ALL KNOW

THAT WE ALL WANT TO GET TO. ON

00:33:58.936 --> 00:34:00.705

WILLING TO ADDRESS KIND OF THE

00:34:12.216 --> 00:34:13.251
GOALS OF THE BILL. WE CAN'T AND

00:34:13.317 --> 00:34:15.253
IT'S EARLY IN THE PROCESS

00:34:15.319 --> 00:34:17.088
MEMBERS- JUST A STRAIGHT OUT NO

00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:18.723
VOTE ON ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.191
BILLS AT ADDRESSING A VERY

00:34:20.258 --> 00:34:22.059
IMPORTANT ISSUE I THINK IS- IS A

00:34:22.126 --> 00:34:23.895
SMALL THING TO ASK JUST TO ALLOW

00:34:23.961 --> 00:34:25.863
HIM TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:27.565
BILL. FROM MY FROM MY STANDPOINT

00:34:27.632 --> 00:34:29.033
OUTLOOK OUR STATE IS NOT ONLY

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:32.136
WORKING ON. A RENEWABLE SOURCES

00:34:32.203 --> 00:34:34.238
OF ENERGY WERE ALSO TRYING TO

00:34:34.305 --> 00:34:37.708
TRANSFORM OUR- OUR GAS GRID. TO

00:34:37.775 --> 00:34:39.977
INJECT RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS

00:34:40.044 --> 00:34:41.145
THAT IS EASIER ON THE

00:34:41.212 --> 00:34:43.281
ENVIRONMENT. THAT HELPS US

00:34:43.347 --> 00:34:45.583
ADDRESS OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:47.552
GOALS AND OTHER ECONOMIC GOALS.

00:34:47.618 --> 00:34:49.454
AND SO- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.723
TO NOTE THAT CERTAIN AREAS THAT

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:55.560
HAVE DON'T HAVE ACCESS. TO-

00:34:55.626 --> 00:34:57.428
CERTAIN LEVELS OF BALANCING OF

00:34:57.495 --> 00:35:02.233
THE GRID- IMAGINE COMPLETELY- IN

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:07.138
SOME CASES- POSING SOME-

00:35:07.205 --> 00:35:09.474
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE- VERY

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.976
BURDENSOME FEDERAL COULD REALLY

00:35:12.043 --> 00:35:14.345
HELP BUILD OPPOSITION TO A LOT

00:35:14.412 --> 00:35:16.414
OF OUR STATE'S GOALS IN IN

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:18.483
TRANSITIONING TO CLEANER POWER

00:35:18.549 --> 00:35:20.218
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO-

00:35:20.284 --> 00:35:21.686
EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE THAT HAS A

00:35:21.752 --> 00:35:24.489
LEGISLATURE WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO

00:35:24.555 --> 00:35:25.623
THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC.

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:27.391
ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE ARE

00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:29.193
REALLY SUFFERING RIGHT NOW AND

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.229
HAVING TO PAY THOSE BILLS. RIGHT

00:35:31.295 --> 00:35:33.297
NOW CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY I KNOW

00:35:33.364 --> 00:35:36.834
SAN DIEGO RECENTLY- THAT GOT A

00:35:36.901 --> 00:35:38.536

AND IT'S HARD FOR US TO SELL-

00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:46.210
RENEWABLE AGENDA WHEN WE HAVE

00:35:46.277 --> 00:35:47.979
THE HIGHEST RATES AND THEN WE

00:35:48.045 --> 00:35:49.146
HAVE TO IMPOSE OTHER

00:35:49.213 --> 00:35:50.948
REQUIREMENTS. ON COMMUNITIES

00:35:51.015 --> 00:35:53.284

MAIN WAY THAT THE PC'S GONNA BE

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:28.405
SUPPLIER. OF THE RIGHT TO MAKE

AND BUT IT REQUIRES CITIES TO

00:54:44.314 --> 00:54:46.316

OPPORTUNITY TO CHAT WITH FOLKS-

01:14:21.924 --> 01:14:24.393
ON FRANKLIN BOTH SIDES OF THIS

01:14:24.459 --> 01:14:27.462

MAY THROUGH THE CHAIR- SOME

01:14:29.331 --> 01:14:30.465

I'M TRYING TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT

01:14:36.438 --> 01:14:38.440
THIS IS CONSOLIDATED INTO A

01:14:38.507 --> 01:14:40.709
DIGESTIBLE FORM I THINK WE ALL

01:14:40.776 --> 01:14:42.644
KNOW THAT. AS WE IN THE

01:14:42.711 --> 01:14:45.280
SPECIALLY AS WE MOVE IN THE

01:14:45.347 --> 01:14:48.917
DIRECTION OF- FLOATING- WIND.

01:14:48.984 --> 01:14:50.819
GENERATION WHICH I THINK SHOULD

01:14:50.886 --> 01:14:52.354
BE THE DIRECTION THAT WE ARE

01:14:52.421 --> 01:14:53.622
GOING AT LEAST FOR A COMPONENT

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:55.424
OF OUR ENERGY NEEDS. WE'RE GONNA

01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:57.092
HAVE TO DEAL WITH-

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:59.194
ELECTRIFICATION INFRASTRUCTURE

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:01.630
TO MOVE THAT TYPE. OF-

01:15:01.697 --> 01:15:04.933
TRANSMISSION. BUT I SO IT SEEMS

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.469
THAT THIS DOCUMENT IS MORE OF A

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:10.606
DIRECTIONAL POLICY DOCUMENT. TO

01:15:10.672 --> 01:15:12.674
THE P. YOU SEE. TO MAKE THE

01:15:12.741 --> 01:15:17.579
NECESSARY- POLICY AND-

01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:20.716
ADMINISTRATIVE. INVESTMENTS TO

01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:22.684
MAKE CERTAIN THAT THAT WE ARE

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:24.453
KEEPING ELECTRIFICATION AT THE

01:15:24.519 --> 01:15:26.321
FOREFRONT OF BECAUSE THESE

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:27.289
THINGS TAKE YEARS SOMETIMES

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:30.292
DECADES. TO PUT INTO EFFECT. I

01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:33.028
WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN IN MAYBE

01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:35.197
YOU CAN COMMENT PLEASE. IN WHAT

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:38.233
FASHION DOES THIS INTERFERE OR

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:42.537
CHALLENGE FOR OUR CREE BARRIERS

01:15:42.604 --> 01:15:44.273
FOR OUR TRADITIONAL EXTRACTION

01:15:44.339 --> 01:15:46.575
IN USAGE OF FOSSIL FUELS BECAUSE

01:15:46.642 --> 01:15:48.744
I THINK EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:50.512
THAT ESPECIALLY AS WE'VE SEEN

01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:52.981
WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH YOUR CREAM-

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:55.617
THAT. CALIFORNIANS MOVING-

01:15:55.684 --> 01:15:56.852
DRAMATICALLY IN THE

01:15:56.919 --> 01:15:59.488
DIVERSIFICATION ROUTE BECAUSE

01:15:59.554 --> 01:16:02.324
YOU CAN'T GO GREEN OVERNIGHT AND

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:04.359
IT'S GOING TO BE IN WE NEED TO

01:16:04.426 --> 01:16:06.461
MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE STILL HAVE

01:16:06.528 --> 01:16:07.329
A COMPONENT. OF OUR ENERGY NEEDS

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:10.032
SATISFIED BY SOME OF THE MORE

01:16:10.098 --> 01:16:11.533
TRADITIONAL- ALSO FUEL

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:14.002
EXTRACTION. SO MY QUESTION TO

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:15.771
THE AUTHORS CAN YOU EXPLAIN

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:17.906
EXACTLY HOW THIS DOCUMENT IF IT

01:16:17.973 --> 01:16:21.677
DOES- SO AT ALL. INTERFERES OR

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:24.313
TAKES A POLICY POSITION THAT

01:16:24.379 --> 01:16:28.016
WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:28.483
TRADITIONAL EXTRACTION

01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:30.919
INDUSTRIES. THANK YOU FOR THE

01:16:30.986 --> 01:16:32.054
QUESTION I DO THINK IT'S

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.355
IMPORTANT AND I JUST WANNA

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:35.223
REITERATE THAT THIS. IN THIS

01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:36.959
BILL THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT TO

01:16:37.025 --> 01:16:39.194
STOP. USING GAS PLANTS DOESN'T

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:42.197
FORCE ANY SHUTDOWNS- WHAT DOES

01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:44.633
IT SAY THAT IF THERE'S CLEAN

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.201
ENERGY AVAILABLE ON THE GRID.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:47.703
THEN LET'S BUILD THE

01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:48.770
TRANSMISSION TO GET IT WHERE IT

01:16:48.837 --> 01:16:51.873
NEEDS TO GO. SO WE SHOULDN'T SAY

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:54.009
WE NEED TO RELY ON THE GAS

01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:57.145
PLANTS AFTER THAT. I'M THE IF

01:16:57.212 --> 01:16:58.146
THERE'S CLEAN ENERGY AVAILABLE

01:16:58.213 --> 01:16:59.748
ELSEWHERE ON THE GRID SO IT

01:16:59.815 --> 01:17:03.118
REALLY YEAH YOU THINK YOUR POINT

01:17:03.185 --> 01:17:04.720
ABOUT PLANNING ABSOLUTELY. IT IS

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:06.688
ABOUT PLANNING A FROM THE P. YOU

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:08.790
SEE I'LL TRUST ONE OTHER-

01:17:08.857 --> 01:17:09.858
QUESTION ISN'T THAT WAS RAISED

01:17:09.925 --> 01:17:13.528
IN MY CLOTHES- BUT I THINK USE

01:17:13.595 --> 01:17:14.696
HEARD FROM ALL THE VOICES IN

01:17:14.763 --> 01:17:16.298
SUPPORT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:18.000
THAT LONG TERM PLANNING HORIZON

01:17:18.066 --> 01:17:19.835
AND IT DOES YES AGAIN DOES NOT

01:17:19.901 --> 01:17:22.337
FORCE. SHUTDOWN OF ANY GAS

01:17:22.404 --> 01:17:24.740
RESOURCES OKAY. FORGIVE ME FOR

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:26.742
FURTHER EMPHASIZING THIS POINT.

01:17:26.808 --> 01:17:28.410
IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS TYPE

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:30.746
OF DOCUMENT. THAT WOULD INSTRUCT

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:33.648
THE P. YOU SEE FOR THEM ACTING

01:17:33.715 --> 01:17:36.284
ON AT THEIR OWN BEHEST. THAT IF

01:17:36.351 --> 01:17:39.955
THERE ARE TWO SOURCES OF ENERGY.

01:17:40.022 --> 01:17:42.257
EXISTING SIMULTANEOUSLY THAT ONE

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:45.160
WOULD BE SEURE IN ONE WOULD BE

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:47.496
SUBORDINATE BY VIRTUE OF THIS

01:17:47.562 --> 01:17:49.197
PIECE OF LEGISLATION. NO ARE THE

01:17:49.264 --> 01:17:50.465
FOCUS IS ON PREPARING

01:17:50.532 --> 01:17:52.334
TRANSMISSIONS THAT WE CAN

01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:54.703
DELIVER CLEAN ENERGY AS IT IS

01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:56.505
BUILT- SO YEAH THE ANSWER

01:17:56.571 --> 01:17:58.874
QUESTIONS NO- IT DOES NOT JUST%

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.575
RIGHT NOW WE CAN BILL OF THE

01:18:00.642 --> 01:18:01.777
CLEAN ENERGY WE WANT WE JUST

01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:03.712
CAN'T GET IT TO WHERE IT NEEDS

01:18:03.779 --> 01:18:05.414
TO BE. AND SO THEREFORE WE'RE

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:06.715
GONNA STOP BUILDING AND IF YOU

01:18:06.782 --> 01:18:08.283
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN GERMANY

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:09.651
IT'S THE SAME THING THAT USED UP

01:18:09.718 --> 01:18:12.120
ALL MOST THEY'RE GOOD- YOU KNOW

01:18:12.187 --> 01:18:12.721
THEY'RE EASY TO BUILD- AT

01:18:12.788 --> 01:18:13.655
LOCATIONS AND NOW THEY'RE CLEAN

01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:15.857
ENERGY- BUILDINGS ACTUALLY GOING

01:18:15.924 --> 01:18:18.627
DOWN. ON AND WE'RE TRYING TO

01:18:18.693 --> 01:18:20.529
AVOID THAT MAKE SURE WE PLANTS

01:18:20.595 --> 01:18:21.229
WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE

01:18:21.296 --> 01:18:22.397
TRANSMISSION ALL THIS OFF SHORE

01:18:22.464 --> 01:18:24.299
WIND ALL THIS THAT WE WANT TO

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:26.568
BUILD. ON WHAT I CAN DO A BILL

01:18:26.635 --> 01:18:27.836
THAT UNLESS WE HAVE THIS IN A

01:18:27.903 --> 01:18:28.737
LONG RANGE PLANNING HORIZON.

01:18:28.804 --> 01:18:31.573
OKAY THIS IS CERTAINLY A TOUCHY

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:32.974
TOPIC AS YOU COULD IMAGINE I

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:37.212
REPRESENT THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

01:18:37.279 --> 01:18:38.680
AND WE STILL HAVE. BY I KNOW OF

01:18:38.747 --> 01:18:40.115
PLAYERS. IN THE TRADITIONAL.

01:18:40.182 --> 01:18:43.885
EXTRACTION INDUSTRY. THEY THEY-

01:18:43.952 --> 01:18:45.754
LITERALLY ARE THE VANGUARD OF

01:18:45.821 --> 01:18:49.124
ENVIRONMENTAL- A BY THIS WHEN IT

01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:50.592
COMES TO ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY

01:18:50.659 --> 01:18:53.328
AND LAWS. AND I KNOW THAT WE ARE

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:55.197
MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION OF

01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:57.933
ELECTRICAL AND SOLAR AND- WIND.

01:18:57.999 --> 01:18:59.434
AND MAKING THIS THE NEXT

01:18:59.501 --> 01:19:02.170
EVOLUTION OF CALIFORNIANS-

01:19:02.237 --> 01:19:05.273
ENERGY SYSTEM- SO I WANTED TO BE

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:07.676
VERY CLEAR THAT. AS I SUPPORT

01:19:07.742 --> 01:19:10.579
THIS TODAY IF THIS DOES CHANGE.

01:19:10.645 --> 01:19:12.848
IN A FASHION WHERE. WE ARE

01:19:12.914 --> 01:19:15.450
FORCIBLY SUBORDINATING. OUR

01:19:15.517 --> 01:19:17.552
TRADITIONAL EXTRACTION INDUSTRY

SYSTEM AWARDED MINISTRY TO

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:24.459
SYSTEM I DON'T THINK I'D BE IN A

01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:26.394
POSITION TO SUPPORT OF IT

01:19:26.461 --> 01:19:27.462
APPEARS THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN

01:19:27.529 --> 01:19:29.231
RIGHT NOW. THAT THIS IS SIMPLY

01:19:29.297 --> 01:19:32.968
EVOLVING THE PUC'S ARE- IT

01:19:33.034 --> 01:19:35.403
MINISTRY OF PAPERWORK AND- IT'S

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:37.706
RESOURCE ALLOCATION DOING WHAT

01:19:37.772 --> 01:19:39.875
NEEDS TO BE DONE ESPECIALLY IN

01:19:39.941 --> 01:19:41.610
THE FIELD OF OFFSHORE WIND. AND

01:19:41.676 --> 01:19:42.511
I THINK WITHOUT BEING IN MIND

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:45.080
I'D BE WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS

01:19:45.147 --> 01:19:45.647
TODAY ASSUMING IT DOES NOT

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:50.452
CHANGE MOVING FORWARD. BOB

01:19:50.519 --> 01:19:57.459

FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR IN

01:20:04.399 --> 01:20:05.567
THE BILL FOR THE GETS SOMETHING

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:07.435
THAT'S BEEN WAY OVERDUE

01:20:07.502 --> 01:20:08.470
CALIFORNIA WE ARE OVER

01:20:08.537 --> 01:20:11.273
PRODUCING- GREEN ENERGY AND

01:20:11.339 --> 01:20:12.607
AREAS AND WE'RE ACTUALLY

01:20:12.674 --> 01:20:14.242
EXPORTING IT TO OTHER STATES AND

01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:15.610
OUR RATE PAYERS ARE PAYING FOR

01:20:15.677 --> 01:20:17.746
IT- TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT A

01:20:17.812 --> 01:20:19.581
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THERE ARE

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:20.615
RATE PAYERS ARE PAYING AND WE'RE

01:20:20.682 --> 01:20:22.851
SENDING ENERGY TO ARIZONA AND

01:20:22.918 --> 01:20:23.985
OTHER PLACES SO I LIKE THAT PART

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:25.620
OF THE BILL. A COUPLE QUESTIONS

01:20:25.687 --> 01:20:29.724
THOUGH ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS-

01:20:29.791 --> 01:20:32.694
MUNICIPALITIES THAT- BY ENERGY

01:20:32.761 --> 01:20:35.697
BY THAT ENERGY- FROM. THE SUPPLY

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:37.699
THAT'S AVAILABLE IN. WITHIN

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:39.968
THEIR GRID AREA. AND THOSE ARE

01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:42.304
PURCHASE POWER AGREEMENTS. AND

01:20:42.370 --> 01:20:44.372
THAT SOME OF THOSE AGREEMENTS-

01:20:44.439 --> 01:20:45.740
ART. SOMETIMES TWENTY TO THIRTY

01:20:45.807 --> 01:20:47.842
YEARS LONG SO IF YOU. ARE A E.

01:20:47.909 --> 01:20:50.278
CCA AND YOU'VE ACQUIRED POWER

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:52.714
FROM. WHATEVER SOURCE IT IS AND

01:20:52.781 --> 01:20:54.382
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S NOW

01:20:54.449 --> 01:20:55.650
A NEW TRANSMISSION LINE. IT

01:20:55.717 --> 01:20:57.185
DOESN'T NEED YOUR POWER IN YOUR

01:20:57.252 --> 01:20:59.120
BRING IN THAT POWER FROM

01:20:59.187 --> 01:21:00.288
SOMEWHERE ELSE. THE UTILITY IS

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:02.190
STILL ON THE HOOK FOR THAT

01:21:02.257 --> 01:21:03.892
PURCHASE POWER AGREEMENT THAT

01:21:03.959 --> 01:21:05.760
WAS AVAILABLE. AT THE TIME WHEN

01:21:05.827 --> 01:21:07.562
THEY HAD TO SECURE POWER FOR

01:21:07.629 --> 01:21:08.463
THEIR CUSTOMERS WHAT HAPPENS TO

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:12.367
THOSE- CONTRACTS- GOING FORWARD

01:21:12.434 --> 01:21:15.737
IF THE TRANSMISSION LINES BUILT.

01:21:15.804 --> 01:21:16.938
AND THEY DON'T NEED THAT POWER

01:21:17.005 --> 01:21:17.806
ANYMORE. WELL FIRST OF ALL

01:21:17.872 --> 01:21:18.807
THANKS FOR FIRST PARTNER

01:21:18.873 --> 01:21:20.508
COMMENTS AND I'M PRETTY SURE NO

01:21:20.575 --> 01:21:21.977
YOU'VE BEEN ON THIS

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:23.545
TRANSMISSION. ISSUE IN THE PAST

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:25.113
. I THINK THE ANSWER IS THAT I

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:27.882
DON'T GAS FROM EXPERTS. I THINK

01:21:27.949 --> 01:21:30.018
ONE OF THE ANSWER IS THAT- ALL

01:21:30.085 --> 01:21:31.353
THIS ENERGY CAN BE NEEDED RIGHT

01:21:31.419 --> 01:21:33.421
OUT THERE I DON'T SEE A FIRST

01:21:33.488 --> 01:21:34.522
YEAR. A SITUATION WHERE IT WON'T

01:21:34.589 --> 01:21:37.225
BE BUT LET ME ASK STEVE ME TAG

01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:39.594
TO SEE IF HE HAS A COMMENT ON

01:21:39.661 --> 01:21:43.765
THAT. A QUESTION. SURE THANK

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:45.900
YOU. YES I THINK- THAT'S EXACTLY

01:21:45.967 --> 01:21:49.304
RIGHT THE- IDEA THAT- THERE IS.

01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:52.140
A GROWING NEED FOR ADDITIONAL

01:21:52.207 --> 01:21:53.975
NEW CLEAN ENERGY AND THIS-

01:21:54.042 --> 01:21:57.012
TRANSMISSION THAT'S- INSPIRED BY

01:21:57.078 --> 01:21:58.146
THIS BILL WILL ADDRESS THAT

01:21:58.213 --> 01:22:00.515
ISSUE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT-

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:02.617
EXISTING. POWER PURCHASE WAS

01:22:02.684 --> 01:22:05.754
MADE TO GO AWAY- HOPEFULLY WE'LL

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.155
STILL BE ECONOMIC IN THIS

01:22:07.222 --> 01:22:08.757
ENVIRONMENT BUT- NEW

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:12.560
TRANSMISSION. FOR NEW GENERATION

01:22:12.627 --> 01:22:17.766
. HE DID. OKAY BUT THAT'S NOT

01:22:17.832 --> 01:22:18.767
REALLY AN ANSWER MY QUESTION

01:22:18.833 --> 01:22:20.001
BECAUSE THERE ARE CONTRACTS OUT

01:22:20.068 --> 01:22:22.170
THEN I'M OUT I KNOW THIS BECAUSE

01:22:22.237 --> 01:22:24.306
WE WERE FACING THAT SO I'M JUST

01:22:24.372 --> 01:22:25.473
GONNA I'M SUPPORT YOUR BILL

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:27.976
TODAY BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE

01:22:28.043 --> 01:22:28.810
AN ANSWER WHEN WE COME BACK TO

01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:30.545
THE TO THE FLOOR BECAUSE I'M AN

01:22:30.612 --> 01:22:32.580
ASSET TO WIN AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S

01:22:32.647 --> 01:22:33.615
VERY CRITICAL YUP THE COST TO

01:22:33.682 --> 01:22:35.884
THE CONSUMER THAT ALREADY ON THE

01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:39.321
HOOK FOR SOME OTHERS- SOURCE OF

01:22:39.387 --> 01:22:41.523
ENERGY. ON THAT SO I THINK IT

01:22:41.589 --> 01:22:42.390
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND I

01:22:42.457 --> 01:22:44.626
HEARD THAT BEFORE I'M ALL FOR.

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:45.493
THE OTHER THERE'S ONE OTHER

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:46.561
QUESTION ONE ISSUE THAT. YOU'RE

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:48.596
FORCING THE PC TO MAKE THE

01:22:48.663 --> 01:22:50.465
DECISION ON TWO LINES. AND IT

01:22:50.532 --> 01:22:52.200
HAS BEEN AN AMENDMENT ON THAT.

01:22:52.267 --> 01:22:55.070
POINT COMMENSURATE YEAH SO IT

01:22:55.136 --> 01:22:57.172
JUST DIDN'T GET INTO PRINT FOR

01:22:57.238 --> 01:22:58.440
THE ORIGINALLY WE DID HAVE THAT

01:22:58.506 --> 01:23:00.909
CONCEPT IN THE BILL- BUT IT HAS

01:23:00.975 --> 01:23:02.911
BEEN AMENDED TO. SAY THAT THE

01:23:02.977 --> 01:23:05.714
CASE SO- CONSIDER APPROVING AT

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:07.415
LEAST ONE. THE WAY WE WENT FOR

01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:08.583
THE LANGUAGE OF APPROVED AT

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:11.453
LEAST TO HIGH PARTY PROJECTS TO

01:23:11.519 --> 01:23:12.520
CONSIDER APPROVING AT LEAST ONE

01:23:12.587 --> 01:23:13.688
. OKAY WELL ALONG I DIDN'T SEE

01:23:13.755 --> 01:23:14.923
THAT AMENDMENT BUT ALONG THOSE

01:23:14.989 --> 01:23:17.225
LINES. YOU KNOW IT. WE SHOULD

01:23:17.292 --> 01:23:20.628
LOOK AT CALIFORNIA'S A WHOLE AND

01:23:20.695 --> 01:23:21.196
FIGURE OUT WHERE WE'RE OVER

01:23:21.262 --> 01:23:22.430
PRODUCING. GREEN ENERGY AND WE

01:23:22.497 --> 01:23:24.265
NEEDED TO GET TO SOMEWHERE ELSE

01:23:24.332 --> 01:23:25.467
THAT SHOULD BE THE PRIORITY THAT

01:23:25.533 --> 01:23:26.768
SHOULD BE DONE BY THE CPUC.

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:27.902
WHICH UNFORTUNATELY HASN'T BEEN

01:23:27.969 --> 01:23:29.437
DONE THAT'S WHY YOU'RE RUNNING

01:23:29.504 --> 01:23:31.339
THIS BILL TO SAY HEY. WE NEED TO

01:23:31.406 --> 01:23:33.675
GO DO THAT SO. I'M THOSE ARE THE

01:23:33.742 --> 01:23:34.876
THINGS I'M GONNA BE LOOKING FOR

01:23:34.943 --> 01:23:36.644
WHEN WE COME BACK- SO. WHAT'S

01:23:36.711 --> 01:23:39.013
THE PRIORITY WHICH AREAS- THAT

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:39.647
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY ARE OVER

01:23:39.714 --> 01:23:43.051
GENERATING. AND GETTING INTO

01:23:43.118 --> 01:23:45.887
AREAS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THAT

01:23:45.954 --> 01:23:47.322
SAME- ABILITY TO GENERATE SO

01:23:47.389 --> 01:23:49.591
THAT WE- WE CAN ACTUALLY BALANCE

01:23:49.657 --> 01:23:51.860
THE GRID. WITH GREEN ENERGY. AT

01:23:51.926 --> 01:23:53.862
THE SAME TIME MAKING SURE THAT

01:23:53.928 --> 01:23:54.429
WE DON'T LEAVE SOMEBODY WAS

01:23:54.496 --> 01:23:56.831
STRANDED ASSETS- THAT A PROCURED

01:23:56.898 --> 01:23:58.533
ENERGY. FOR LONG HAUL AND I

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.635
THINK IF THAT WAS THE CASE THE

01:24:00.702 --> 01:24:01.870
SPEAKER PLANT FOLKS. AND WE HAVE

01:24:01.936 --> 01:24:04.038
TO MAKE THEM WHOLE THEY BUILT

01:24:04.105 --> 01:24:04.839
THESE PLANTS. AND INVESTED MONEY

01:24:04.906 --> 01:24:06.875
EXPECTING. A CONTRACT SOMEWHERE

01:24:06.941 --> 01:24:08.910
IF THAT CHANGES THEN WE NEED TO

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:10.378
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE MADE

01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:12.080
WHOLE. THANK YOU AND AGAIN I

01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:13.648
GOTTA COME INTO AT THE EXISTING

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:15.750
CONTRACTS ARE GOING TO BE

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:16.384
HONORABLE CLARIFY WITH YOU BUT

01:24:16.451 --> 01:24:18.119
DON'T FEEDBACK I'VE GOTTEN. FROM

01:24:18.186 --> 01:24:19.687
FOLKS WHO WORK WITH EXISTING

01:24:19.754 --> 01:24:20.355
CONTRACTS ARE GOING TO BE

01:24:20.422 --> 01:24:21.689
HONORED JUST WHEN YOU NEED TO

01:24:21.756 --> 01:24:23.725
BUY NEW ENERGY. THEN REMOVING

01:24:23.792 --> 01:24:24.559
THE TRANSMISSION CONSTRAINTS

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:26.161
GIVES YOU MORE CHOICES. AND THE

01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:27.295
SECOND PART OF A SAID ABSOLUTELY

01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:29.931
I NEED WE NEED TO DO THAT MAP.

01:24:29.998 --> 01:24:30.698
AND I THINK THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:24:30.765 --> 01:24:32.267
FOR EXAMPLE VIA. THE BIG BENEFIT

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:34.135
SURE OF THIS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

01:24:34.202 --> 01:24:35.103
WE LIMIT TRANSITION FROM THOSE

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:37.305
AREAS- THAT PREVENT THEM FROM

01:24:37.372 --> 01:24:38.606
SELLING CLEAN ENERGY TO

01:24:38.673 --> 01:24:40.275
CUSTOMERS AND- IN CITY SO. A

01:24:40.341 --> 01:24:41.376
GROUP BOTH THROUGH THAT WE DO

01:24:41.443 --> 01:24:43.445
NEED TO DO THAT PLANNING AND I

01:24:43.511 --> 01:24:45.647
THINK THE SENSE OF I WILL BE A

01:24:45.713 --> 01:24:46.448
BENEFIT SURE OF THAT. AND IF I

01:24:46.514 --> 01:24:48.516
MIGHT SUGGEST IF YOU REALLY WANT

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:49.951
TO BE PULLED. WHO WOULDN'T STOP.

01:24:50.018 --> 01:24:51.085
ALLOWING GENERATION TO BE

01:24:51.152 --> 01:24:52.954
PROCURED IN AREAS WHERE WE HAVE.

01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:53.888
TOO MUCH ALREADY. THAT WOULD

01:24:53.955 --> 01:24:55.523
REALLY BE BOLD BECAUSE THEN. WE

01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:56.624
COULD ACTUALLY DRIVE THE COST

01:24:56.691 --> 01:24:57.625
DOWN FOR CUSTOMERS IN

01:24:57.692 --> 01:24:59.227
CALIFORNIA. THESE ARE GETTING A

01:24:59.294 --> 01:25:01.863
TAX REBATE. ON BUILDING THEIR

01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:03.765
SOLAR INCENTIVIZE FORD OR WIND.

01:25:03.832 --> 01:25:05.467
AND THERE'S NO NEED FOR THAT

01:25:05.533 --> 01:25:07.202
AREA SO. IT'S A MATTER OF

01:25:07.268 --> 01:25:08.570
BALANCING THAT GREAT OUT SO

01:25:08.636 --> 01:25:09.637
APPRECIATE YOUR BILL AND LOOKING

01:25:09.704 --> 01:25:12.373
FOR THE DETAILS WHEN WE GET TO

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:14.509
THE NEXT COMMITTEE. THANK YOU.

01:25:14.576 --> 01:25:17.879
ANYONE ELSE. BILL MOTION BY

01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:20.515
SENATOR STERN BACK IN IF I COULD

01:25:20.582 --> 01:25:21.583
JUST ADD COMMENTS BECAUSE I KNOW

01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:23.718
WE'VE GONE THROUGH- A REVIEW OF

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:25.220
THIS PROCESS VERY THOROUGH

01:25:25.286 --> 01:25:27.722
CIRCUITS IN THIS BILL GENERALLY

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:33.228
IS- QUITE. NONSPECIFIC ON A LOT

01:25:33.294 --> 01:25:35.530
OF ISSUES AND I THINK THE

01:25:35.597 --> 01:25:36.898
LEGISLATURE DOES NEED TO GET

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:40.702
SPECIFIC WHEN IT COMES TO- HOW

01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:42.604
HOW WE INVEST IN PLANNING

01:25:42.670 --> 01:25:44.939
BECAUSE AGAIN ALL OF THIS. HAS A

01:25:45.006 --> 01:25:48.443
RETURN ON COST. I DO WANNA BEGIN

01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:50.712
BY POINTING OUT THE AMENDMENT

01:25:50.778 --> 01:25:53.448
THAT WAS- PROPOSED AND IF I CAN

01:25:53.515 --> 01:25:55.250
JUST CORRECT. SENATOR BAKER A

01:25:55.316 --> 01:25:57.886
BIT ON THE AMENDMENT ALL READ IT

MINE WHAT THE AMENDMENT IS THE

01:26:01.456 --> 01:26:04.526
FIRST AMENDMENT. WAS REFERENCED-

01:26:04.592 --> 01:26:06.594
AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S

01:26:06.661 --> 01:26:08.429
READ ACCURATELY INTO THE RECORD.

01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:10.331
IT DELETES REFERENCE TO

01:26:10.398 --> 01:26:12.267
REQUIRING THE CHI SO TO APPROVE

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:14.168
TWO OR MORE PROJECTS. TWO OR

GENERALLY WE DON'T HAVE ANY-

01:26:33.154 --> 01:26:35.990
COST ANALYSIS ON THIS AND I

01:26:36.057 --> 01:26:38.293
THINK THAT IS AGAIN WE HAVE TO

01:26:38.359 --> 01:26:42.030
BE VERY SENSITIVE TO HOW. WE

01:26:42.096 --> 01:26:43.965
INVEST IN OUR- RENEWABLE

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:46.434
PORTFOLIO THAT WITH THAT WE

01:26:46.501 --> 01:26:49.604
LIMIT- THAT WE REALLY MAKE THOSE

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:51.573
INVESTMENTS IN TERMS OF BENEFIT

01:26:51.639 --> 01:26:53.875
TO THE SYSTEM COST BENEFIT

01:26:53.942 --> 01:26:57.045
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT. AND OFTEN

01:26:57.111 --> 01:26:59.247
TIMES A WEEK WE THINK LESS ABOUT

01:26:59.314 --> 01:27:01.883
THE COST BENEFIT WHICH IS SET

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:03.952
RATES CAR WASH CORRUPTION YOU

01:27:04.018 --> 01:27:07.121
MEANT YOU MENTIONED. A COASTAL

01:27:07.188 --> 01:27:11.492
WIND POWER BAND I JUST RAISES

01:27:11.559 --> 01:27:14.562
LOTS OF RED FLAGS TO ME BECAUSE

01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:15.897
CITING- WIND POWER IN THE

01:27:15.964 --> 01:27:19.200
CALIFORNIA COASTLINE IS GOING TO

01:27:19.267 --> 01:27:19.767
BE A VERY DIFFICULT THING.

01:27:19.834 --> 01:27:21.235
ESPECIALLY FROM MY EXPERIENCE IN

01:27:21.302 --> 01:27:22.971
THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND HOW

01:27:23.037 --> 01:27:24.639
TO CREATE THOSE CONNECTIONS TO

01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:27.942
THE MAINLAND. IT'S GOING TO BE

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:30.478
EXTREMELY EXTREMELY COSTLY. AND

01:27:30.545 --> 01:27:35.183
SOMEWHAT OF A RISK- SO. A SECOND

01:27:35.249 --> 01:27:37.719
AB MENTIONED ARE WE GONNA START-

01:27:37.785 --> 01:27:39.721

01:27:39.787 --> 01:27:41.990
OF WHETHER THERE'S AN IMPACT OR

01:27:42.056 --> 01:27:43.424
NOT I THINK WE SHOULD KNOW THAT

01:27:43.491 --> 01:27:45.660
AS LEGISLATURE AND I HOPE. THAT

01:27:45.727 --> 01:27:46.761
