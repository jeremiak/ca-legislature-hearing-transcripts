GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.549 region:rollup2
MEMBERS NANCY CHINA SINCE BEEN

00:30:49.948 --> 00:30:52.451 region:rollup2
ALSO ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA

00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:54.986 region:rollup2
SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION.

00:30:52.451 --> 00:30:57.255 region:rollup2
ONCE AGAIN WE MUST REGRETFULLY

00:30:54.986 --> 00:31:00.425 region:rollup2
OPPOSE THIS BILL OF REALLY DUE

00:30:57.255 --> 00:31:02.594 region:rollup2
TO THE APPROACH THAT IT TAKES SO

00:31:00.425 --> 00:31:04.329 region:rollup2
PAGE FIVE THE SECOND PARAGRAPH

00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:06.264 region:rollup2
IN YOUR ANALYSIS POSITS THAT.

00:31:04.329 --> 00:31:07.366 region:rollup2
UNDER THIS BILL THAT SCHOOL

00:31:06.264 --> 00:31:09.167 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS COULD STILL AVAIL

00:31:07.366 --> 00:31:09.968 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES OF THE STANDARD THAT

00:31:09.167 --> 00:31:11.436 region:rollup2
SAYS THAT.

00:31:09.968 --> 00:31:13.371 region:rollup2
THEY COULD BORROWED ADORNMENT

00:31:11.436 --> 00:31:15.006 region:rollup2
IF IT WAS LIKELY TO CAUSE A

00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:16.641 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL DISRUPTION BUT UNDER

00:31:15.006 --> 00:31:19.010 region:rollup2
A LEGAL FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED IN

00:31:16.641 --> 00:31:19.811 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WE FIND THAT WE WOULD

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.546 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE.

00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:23.014 region:rollup2
THE SOLD LEGAL FOUNDATION TO

00:31:21.546 --> 00:31:24.449 region:rollup2
USE SUCH A DEFENSE AND IN FACT

00:31:23.014 --> 00:31:26.485 region:rollup2
THE VERY PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL

00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:27.819 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKELY SU LOCAL EDUCATION

00:31:26.485 --> 00:31:29.621 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS IF THEY TRY TO

00:31:27.819 --> 00:31:30.889 region:rollup2
AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THIS. SO

00:31:29.621 --> 00:31:32.624 region:rollup2
THAT IS OUR CONCERN WITH THE

00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:33.692 region:rollup2
APPROACH IN THIS BILL WE THINK

00:31:32.624 --> 00:31:36.027 region:rollup2
THAT IT ACTUALLY.

00:31:33.692 --> 00:31:38.397 region:rollup2
IT IT GOES FARTHER THAT IT

00:31:36.027 --> 00:31:40.365 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO TO ACHIEVE WHAT WE

00:31:38.397 --> 00:31:42.100 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IS THE INTENT OF THE

00:31:40.365 --> 00:31:43.135 region:rollup2
AUTHOR SO WE VERY MUCH LOOK

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.170 region:rollup2

00:31:43.135 --> 00:31:47.005 region:rollup2
