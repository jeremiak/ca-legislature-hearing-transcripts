THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL NINE SEVEN NINE TO YOU TODAY. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBERS CRISTINA GARCIA AND DAVID CHIU FOR JOINT OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. AB NINE SEVEN NINE HAS BEEN A PART OF A LARGER EFFORT TO ENSURE PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO UPWARD MOBILITY AND AMERICAN CORP SOCIETY. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I INTRODUCED ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT NINETEEN WHICH REQUIRED THE UCLA BUNCHE CENTER TO CONDUCT A BI ANNUAL STUDY ON RACIAL ETHNIC GENDER. AND LGBT DIVERSITY OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES OF AMERICAN HIGH TECH COMPANIES. AB NINE SEVENTY NINE HAS NOT AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETEEN BUT FURTHER THESE EFFORTS BY FOLLOWING THE POLICY MODEL OF SENATOR JACKSON'S S. B. EIGHT TWENTY SIX. WHICH REQUIRE GENDER DIVERSITY ON CORPORATE BOARDS. EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY NINE REQUIRES A MINIMUM OF ONE DIRECTOR FROM AN UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITY ON ALL BOARDS OF PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATIONS HEADQUARTERED IN CALIFORNIA BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE BILL WILL ALSO REQUIRE A MINIMUM OF TWO DIRECTORS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES FOR BOARDS THAT HAVE FIVE TO EIGHT DIRECTORS. AND THREE DIRECTORS FOR BOARDS WITH MORE THAN NINE DIRECTORS BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR SYSTEM TO CYSTIC HAS REPORTED THAT IN AND UNITED STATES WERE WHITE. WHAT CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF ON BEING A MINORITY MAJORITY MINORITY STATE CORPORATIONS DO NOT REFLECT THE VAST CULTURAL WELLS OF THE STATE. FOR EXAMPLE THE TOP TEN CALIFORNIA BANKS ONLY 30% OF DIRECTORS OR PEOPLE OF COLOR. THIS IS TO STICK PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE 67% OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION BETTER PEOPLE OF COLOR. WE CAN ALSO LOOK TO SILICON VALLEY FOR EXAMPLES OF UNDER REPRESENTATION. ON AVERAGE BLACK AND LATINO TECH EMPLOYEES MAKE UP LESS THAN 10% OF THE WORKERS AT PREMIER COMPANIES SUCH AS GOOGLE APPLE MICROSOFT FACEBOOK AND LINKEDIN. THIS PERCENTAGE IS DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE ROUGHLY 20% OF COMPUTER SCIENCE GRADUATES THAT ARE BLACK OR LATINO. ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS MAKE UP A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF THE WHITE COLLAR WORKFORCE WHAT ARE THE LEAST LIKELY TO BE PROMOTED AND MOVED UP THE LADDER. THE LIGHT OF RECENT SOCIAL AND RACIAL INJUSTICE JUSTICE PROTESTS CORPORATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE CONDUCTED REVIEWS OF THE WORK FORCE AND HAVE MADE PROMISES. TO INCREASE DIVERSITY. MANY TECH GIANTS BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN YET THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE OF COLOR BEING HIRED AND PROMOTED HAS NOT CHANGED. A RECENT REPORT BY MCKINSEY AND COMPANY SHOWS THAT COMPANIES WITH A DIVERSE WORK FORCE AND A DIVERSE CORPORATE BOARD PERFORM BETTER THAN BOARDS WITHOUT DIVERSITY. YET THE FACE OF THE WHITE COLLAR EMPLOYEE REMAINS UNCHANGED. BY CHANGING THE CORPORATE BOARD TO CHANGE THE COMPANY'S CULTURE. A DIVERSE BOARD CONTRIBUTES TO A COMPANY THAT VALUES DIVERSITY THANK TO READILY ADAPT TO THE CHANGING NEEDS OF ITS WORKFORCE AND CUSTOMER BASE. WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THE RACIAL INJUSTICE AND INEQUALITY IN OUR SOCIETY PEOPLE OF COLOR MUST HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE WORK OVERWHELMINGLY AMOUNT OF WEALTH IS BASED. ESPECIALLY IN A STATE AS DIVERSE AS CALIFORNIA. WHEN MANY CORPORATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO OR WILLING TO MAKE MEANINGFUL CHANGE. HEWLETT PACKARD AND BLOOM ENERGY HAVE MADE STRIDES IN DIVERSIFYING THE CORPORATE LANDSCAPE. PLEASE CUT TO CUT TO THESE TWO GROUPS SHOW THAT THE INTENT OF EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY NINE IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT A TENABLE. EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY NINE WILL WILL BE AMENDED AND SENATE APPROPRIATIONS TO ADDRESS A TECHNICAL CONCERN RAISED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE. MY COLLEAGUES ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA AND DAVID CHIU HAVE JOINED ME TO SPEAK ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS LEGISLATION. FOLLOWING THEIR PRESENTATION KIM RIVERA STRATEGY AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT OF H. P. AND BUCK G. DIRECTOR OF THE CORPORATE EXECUTIVE INITIATIVE. AN EXECUTIVE ADVISOR TO SEND YOUR PRIVATE PROVIDE TESTIMONY. I THANK YOU RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERSHIP. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. EMERITI TODAY AS A PROUD JOIN AUTHOR OF AB NINE SEVEN NINE WHEN WE FIRST GOT ELECTED A NUMBER OF US INCLUDING MR HOLDEN AND I HAVE BEEN URGING CORPORATIONS ESPECIALLY IN THE TECH INDUSTRY TO DIVERSIFY THEIR MORE THAN THEIR WORK FORCE. I AM PROMISES WERE MADE IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN BUT I STUDIES HAVE SHOWN LITTLE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE. HELLO THE POPULATION ARE LATINOS. BUT WE ONLY HOLD TWO POINT 3% OF THE DIRECTORS. OF THE FORTUNE ONE THOUSAND COMPANIES HEADQUARTERED IN CALIFORNIA. ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS MAKE UP A COMBINED 60% OF THE POPULATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA. YET ONLY MAKE THREE POINT 7% OF THE VECTORS OF FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND EVERYTHING US AT USC REYES AND EQUITIES- CENTER CITY SHOWS THAT BLACKS TEND TO BE EMPLOYED IN THE LOWEST PAYING THESE POWERFUL POSITIONS. LEAST LIKELY TO SHOW UP ON A BOARD. WE MUST DO BETTER THAN THAT. THIRTY SEVEN SHOWN THEIR PREPARATIONS WITH THE MORE THEIR BIRTH AN EQUITABLE BOARD IMPROVE COMPANY GOVERNANCE AND A BETTER DECISION MAKING WHICH LEADS TO A MORE SUCCESSFUL COMPANY. DIVERSITY AND EQUITY ON CORPORATE BOARDS AS NECESSARY FOR THE HEALTH OF THE COMPANY WHILE ALSO PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES TO THOSE EXPERIENCED RACISM. AND MICRO AGGRESSIONS ON A DAILY BASIS. CALIFORNIA'S UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS THE SERVICE SEAT AT THE TABLE. THE ONE QUESTION I HAVE AN ANSWER IS WHY WHY NOW WHY NOT WAIT A LITTLE BIT LONGER WHEN I GIVE THESE COMPANIES A LITTLE MORE TIME. OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE HAVE SEEN RACIAL THE RACIAL RECKONING TRIGGERED BY THE KILLING OF GEORGE FLOYD. THE PUBLIC CONTINUES TO PROTEST. DEMANDING THAT WE TURN THAT RACIAL BIAS IS STARTING WITH OUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS. FOR REALLY DEMANDING THAT RACIAL BIASES BE TURNED ON AND ALL OUR SYSTEMS. THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR AND THE LEGISLATURE MUST DO ALL THEY CAN TO PART IT'S TO PRIORITIZE EQUALITY AND EQUITY NOW. WE CN NO LONGER WAIT TO ANSWER THE CRIES FOR JUSTICE FOR JUSTICE WITH MEANINGFUL LEGISLATION LIKE AB NINE SEVEN NINE. HIS FRIEND FOR THIS REASON I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

AND WHO DO WE HAVE AGAIN CHECK. YEAH I'M BUT G. REPRESENTING A POP UP ART. SO I CAN'T OKAY I'M HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF NEARLY TWENTY ASIAN AMERICAN BUSINESS COMMUNITY GROUPS SUPPORTING AB NINE SEVEN NINE. I COUPLE SILICON VALLEY WAY WORK FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS BEFORE RETIRING AND LYFT PRESENT AT CISCO SYSTEMS. SINCE THEN I'VE SPENT MUCH OF MY TIME RESEARCHING THE CORPORATE GLASS CEILING FOR MINORITY MEN AND BUNDLE THE WEB. MY RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT YOU VERY LITTLE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE FIRST HARLEM. WE SHIPPED IN THE PAST DECADE. DESPITE THE BEST EFFORTS IN CORPORATE STRUCTURE. A REVIEW OF THE EOC DATING CALIFORNIA SHOWS THAT WHITE MEN AND WOMEN ARE NOT ONLY 46% OF PROTECTION WORKFORCE. RESORT PRISON 71% OF ALL EXECUTIVES IN CALIFORNIA TWENTY. THE DATA IS CLEAR IT ISN'T STRATEGIES TO DIVERSIFY LEADERSHIP HAVE FAILED. THAT'S WHY TIME FOR NEW APPROACH TOOK CELEBRATE LEADERSHIP CHANGES AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS. IT IS CRIME CALIFORNIA REQUIRES SEATS IN THE BORDERS ARE UNDER SUPPORT UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES. THOSE COMMUNITIES REPRESENT 67% OF CALIFORNIA POPULATION BUT HOLD ONLY 14% OF FORTUNE ONE THOUSAND BOARD SEATS IN CALIFORNIA. MY ANALYSIS FOUND THAT EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY NINE WILL DOUBLE THAT NUMBER. AND AT A HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MINORITY BOARD MEMBERS TO FORTUNE ONE THOUSAND BOARDS. SOME WORRY THAT FINDING QUALIFIED MINORITY RECORDS WILL BE HARD. BUT I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN'T FIND A HARDER FIVE HIGHLY QUALIFIED CANDIDATES. FOR THE TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND MINORITY CORRECTIVE CALIFORNIA. IT IS STILL ONLY 28% OF CALIFORNIANS FORTUNE ONE THOUSAND BOARD SEATS. WE DO NOT THINK THAT 20% IS TOO MUCH TO ASK OF CORPORATE LEADERS TO BETTER REPRESENT. THOSE 67% OF ALL CALIFORNIANS IN UNDERTAKEN MINORITIES THANK YOU. YOU. WILL MOVE ON TO THE STAR WITNESSES ONLINE AND SUPPORTERS STATING YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION.

WE HAVE NO FURTHER IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME OKAY BEFORE WE MOVED OPPOSITION I SEE SOMEONE CHIU HAS ARRIVED TO WORK ON A LOT OF YOUNG GUYS OPPORTUNITY- PRESENT MAKE HIS PRESENTATION ON SUPPORT OF AB NINE SEVEN NINE. SEVEN INCHES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR APOLOGIES- LITTLE CONFUSION ABOUT WHERE I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THIS MORNING BUT- APPRECIATE YOU ALLOWING ME AND OTHERS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB NINE SEVEN NINE. I'M TESTIFYING AS THE CHAIR OF THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS AND ALSO AS A JOINT AUTHORS OF THIS BILL. TO URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE TO ENSURE THAT OUR CALIFORNIA CORPORATE BOARDS REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE. ASIAN AMERICANS ARE THE FASTEST GROWING ETHNIC GROUP IN OUR COUNTRY. NATIONALLY WE ARE A LITTLE OVER 3% OF ALL FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED BOARD SEATS. THE MODEL MINORITY MYTH THAT ASIAN AMERICANS PERFORM WELL HAS SERVED TO MASK. THE CHALLENGES THAT OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE FACED IN CORPORATE AMERICA. FOR EXAMPLE. IN SILICON VALLEY. WHAT ASIAN AMERICANS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN POSITIONS. WITHIN THE RANK AND FILE OF OUR WORKFORCE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGE OF EXECUTIVES. THOSE NUMBERS ARE CUT IN HALF. THIS REPRESENTS THE LARGEST NEGATIVE DISPARITY BETWEEN REPRESENTATION OF EXECUTIVES AND THE WORK FORCE AMONG ALL RACIAL GROUPS. IN CALIFORNIA A RECENT STUDY BY THE SUN FOUNDATION FOUND THAT ASIAN AMERICANS ARE LEAST LIKELY TO BE PROMOTED TO MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTIVE POSITIONS AND THIS IS WHY THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY A SEND AND MANY APR ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING A POP UP LEAGUE OF CITIES API CAUCUS THE ASIAN LAW CAUCUS. THE NATIONAL A. P. BAR CESSATION AND MORE. OUR LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS ALONG WITH OUR COUNTERPARTS HAVE PRIORITIZE DIVERSITY IN EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT AND LEADERSHIP IN RECENT YEARS. IN RECENT MONTHS A BRIGHT LIGHT HAS ILLUMINATED THE DISPARITIES IN ALL ASPECTS OF OUR SOCIETY REVIEW THE SYSTEMATIC BARRIERS THAT HAVE PREVENTED US FROM ACHIEVING. REAL EQUITY THIS IS A BILL THAT RECOGNIZES THE LEADERSHIP ON OUR CORPORATE BOARDS MUST BE DIVERSE THE GUY CALIFORNIA COMPANIES TO MAKE THE STRATEGIC DECISIONS THAT ARE INNOVATIVE. AND BEST FOR THE ORGANIZATION TO SERVE OUR STATE AND WITH THAT I ALSO REALLY WANT TO THANK- THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL SO LONG AS OUR AS WELL AS OUR COLLEAGUE CRISTINA GARCIA. FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS AND THE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. WHILE WE'VE BEEN NOW INFORMED THAT ON A CAMERA HERE WITH H. P. IS ON A LONG SHOW WE WILL. ALLOW HER TO MANY TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF. AB NINE SEVEN NINE MATHIS REVERE YOUR BILL. THANK YOU ARE CHAIRMAN BRADFORD AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CAN YOU HEAR ME OK FONG. TO RESPECT. OUT SORRY FOR PARILLI THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE LINE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY ON THE IMPORTANT ISSUE OF DIVERSITY ON CORPORATE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS. AND H. P. WE'RE PROUD TO HAVE THE MOST DIVERSE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN THE US TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY WITH MEMBERS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES INCLUDING. AFRICAN AMERICAN LATIN ACT AND ASIAN MEMBERS WE UNDERSTAND ONE OF THE GOALS OF AB NINE SEVEN NINE IT ENCOURAGE BOARD MAKE UP THAT IS AS DIVERSE AS POSSIBLE RATHER THAN INCLUDING ONLY ONE UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITY AND THAT H. P. WE- THAT INTENT AND WE ENDEAVOR TO MEET THAT GOAL. WE RECOGNIZE THAT EACH PIECE TO BOARD ANY US TO BETTER SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO POSITION OUR BUSINESS FOR FUTURE SUCCESS WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO ENCOURAGE HIGH STANDARDS FOR CORPORATE BOARD DIVERSITY AND FOR THIS REASON WE SUPPORT AB NINE SEVEN NINE WHICH WILL ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIA TO LEAD THE NATION. IN BRINGING UNDERREPRESENTED. COMMUNITIES TO CORPORATE BOARDS. EVERYONE BY WHEN LEADERSHIP REFLECTS THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF OUR DIVERSE STATE AND NATION. SIMPLY SAYING WE SUPPORT DIVERSITY IS NOT AND NOW WE MUST LEAD BY PUTTING THE DEVALUED INTO ACTION EVERY DAY. OUR FOUNDERS BILL HEWLETT AND DAVE PACKARD WUDI H. PECAN TO DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN THE H. P. WAIT FIRST PRINCIPLE IN TRUST AND RESPECT INDIVIDUALS TODAY DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION ARE EMBEDDED IN ALL WE DO. EVERY H. P. EMPLOYEE PLAYED A PART IN ENSURING THAT WE BELONG INNOVATE AND GROW TOGETHER IN FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE MOST INNOVATIVE SOLUTION COP. CULTURE LUCIEN COME FROM ASSEMBLING TEAMS WITH DIVERSE. VIEWPOINTS AND BACKGROUNDS. WE CHALLENGED SERVICE PROVIDERS IN BOTH LEGAL AND MARKETING TO ENSURE DIVERSE STAFFING ALL OUR ACCOUNTS AT THE MOST SENIOR LEVELS AND ITS CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER I AM ESPECIALLY PLEASED TO REPORT THAT 94% OF OUR LAW FIRM. MATT OUR DIVERSITY REQUIREMENT IN TWENTY NINETEEN UP FROM 46% WHEN WE STARTED THE PROGRAM WELL WE'RE PROUD OF OUR PROGRESS TO DATE WE ALSO. IS THAT THERE IS LOT MORE DOT WORRY WE PLEDGE DOUBLE OUR NUMBER OF BLACK AND AFRICAN AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL. INCLUDE YOUR TESTIMONY AS SOON AS AS POSSIBLE PLEASE. SURE I'LL CONCLUDE BY SAYING DIVORCE DIVERSITY BEEN AN IMPORTANT PART OF H. P. D. N. A. SINCE OUR COMPANY'S EARLY ESTATE AND WE BELIEVE IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A SOURCE OF STRENGTH IN THE FUTURE WE- SUPPORT THIS BILL AND WE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. READERS THE MONEY I'VE ALSO BEEN MADE AWARE THAT SOME WOMEN ARAMBULA WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL SO WE CAN DO THAT AT THIS POINT. I WAS HERE TO BE A THIRD AND FINAL ORDER BUT I'M HAPPY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BECAUSE I BELIEVE OUR BOARDS NEED TO BE LIKE. PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THIS DIET RIGHT NOW. OUR BOARD THREE TO REFLECT OUR COMMUNITIES WHERE WE HAVE WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. I'M PROUD TO STAND HERE IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE'LL GO BACK TO THE PHONE LINES JUST IN CASE THERE WAS ANYONE ELSE IN Q. THAT WANTED TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT WE WILL CHECK THAT ONE MORE TIME BEFORE WE GOT OPPOSITION. AND AS A REMINDER PRESS ONE ZERO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHOW SUPPORT. WE DO HAVE- ONE DOLLAR IN Q. JUST A MOMENT WE GIVE THEM THEIR LINE NUMBER. AND WE WILL GO TO THAT LINE ITS LINE SEVENTY FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR OPEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF IT I'M GRATEFUL BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ISAAC BRYANT I'M THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR THE ROUTED BY CENTER UCLA. I WILL BE LOOKING AT DIVERSITY AND HIGH TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES AND ADVERSITY IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ONE THING THAT WE'VE NOTICED IS THE RESEARCH IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THINKING ON. IN ORDER TO DISPERSE WE JUST NEED YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION TO SUPPORT AND THAT YOU'RE IN SUPPORT. I REMIND YOU ROCK BUNCH OF. SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL IN THE AND SOME. WE HAVE NO FURTHER IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU THEN WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO OPPOSITION I UNDERSTAND LEAD WITNESS IN OPPOSITION IS KEITH BISHOP IS KEITH BISHOP PREPARED TO TESTIFY HE WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES. YES THANK YOU GOOD MORNING I'M KEITH BISHOP TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION TO AB NINE SEVEN NINE. BY WAY BACKGROUND I'VE BEEN PRACTICING CORPORATE AND SECURITIES LAW IN CALIFORNIA FOR NEARLY FORTY YEARS. I PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS CALIFORNIA'S COMMISSIONER OF CORPORATIONS AND I CURRENTLY TEACH SECURITIES REGULATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE SCHOOL OF LAW. I AM CO AUTHOR OF THE LEADING TREATISES ON CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA CORPORATE LAW AND A PRACTICE CONSULTANT TO THE LEADING TREATISE ON CALIFORNIA'S SECURITIES LAW. I'M SPEAKING THIS MORNING IN MY INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. AND. AND IT AB NINE SEVEN NINE WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE IT WILL DISCRIMINATE AGAINST MALE AND NON BINARY BOARD CANDIDATES IN FAVOR OF FEMALE MINORITY BOARD CANDIDATES. IN MY OPINION AB NINE SEVEN NINE ALSO VIOLATES THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSES OF THE U. S. IN CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONS. NOTABLY THE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS IN THE BILL SITE THIRD PARTY DATA ABOUT MINORITY REPRESENTATION. IN THE CATEGORY OF EMPLOYMENT NOT IN THE CATEGORY OF DIRECTORSHIPS IN ADDITION THE DATA WITH RESPECT TO DIRECTORS ARE LIMITED TO FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES WELL THE BILL WOULD APPLY TO PUBLICLY HELD CORPORATIONS. AND MUCH LARGER CLASS OF COMPANIES. NONE OF THESE FINDINGS RELATE SPECIFICALLY TO PUBLICLY HELD CORPORATIONS WITH THEIR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES. IN CALIFORNIA THEREFORE NONE OF THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT- PROVIDE A STRONG BASIS IN EVIDENCE FOR THE CONCLUSION THAT REMEDIAL ACTION IS NECESSARY AS IS REQUIRED BY U. S. SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE BILL WOULD VIOLATE THE COMMERCE CLAUSE OF THE U. S. CONSTITUTION THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS OF THE BILL REFERS TO SECTION TWENTY ONE FIFTEEN OF THE CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS CODE. THAT STATUTE HOWEVER REQUIRES A MUCH HIGHER NEXUS TO CALIFORNIA THEN DOES AB NINE SEVEN NINE. MORE IMPORTANTLY SECTION TWENTY ONE FIFTEEN DOES NOT EVEN APPLY TO THE VERY CORPORATIONS THAT WOULD BE SEVENTY TWO AB NINE SEVEN NINE. THE BILL RELIES ON NAY DIRECTOR SELF IDENTIFICATION AS A MEMBER OF AN UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITY WHICH IS DEFINED BY RACE OR ETHNICITY. THIS IS PROBLEMATICAL FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR EXAMPLE CANNOT SELF IDENTIFICATION BE ENTIRELY SUBJECTIVE WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH RECENT HIGHLY PUBLICIZED CONTROVERSIES INVOLVING CHALLENGES TO INDIVIDUALS CLAIMING TO BE AFRICAN AMERICAN. OR NATIVE AMERICAN WITH ALLEGEDLY LITTLE OR NO EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE THOSE CLAIMS. THE RACIAL ETHNIC CATEGORIES IN THE BILL ARE ALSO CONSERVING ENERGY TO CONCLUDE YOUR PRESENTATION AS OUR YOU'VE EXCEEDED YOUR TWO MINUTES OKAY. I'M JUST ABOUT DONE FOR EXAMPLE COULD SOMEONE OF ARMENIAN DESCENT SELF IDENTIFY AS ASIAN COULD FORMER U. S. SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BENJAMIN CARDOZO SELF IDENTIFY AS HISPANIC BECAUSE HE WAS A SEPHARDIC TO. THE REQUIREMENT OF SELF IDENTIFICATION ALSO RAISES FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE BECAUSE IT INVOLVES GOVERNMENT COMPELLED SPEECH FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB NINE SEVEN NINE MORE IMPORTANTLY I DO NOT BELIEVE THE YOU CAN END DISCRIMINATION BY PRACTICING DISCRIMINATION. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO. THE HEARING ROOM HERE IS OR ANYONE IS AN OPPOSITION AND ROOM FORTY TWO OLD THREE. SHANE NINE WILL MOVE TO OUR OVERFLOW ROOM OF TWENTY FORTY IS OR ANYONE IN THE ROOM TWENTY FORTY IN OPPOSITION. SEEN ON THERE ARE WE WILL NOW MOVE TO OUR PHONE LINES MISTER MODERATORS DO WE HAVE- CALLERS. IN Q. AND OPPOSITION OF AB NINE SEVEN NINE. AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHOW OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. FOLLOWING A FEW MOMENTS HERE WE HAVE NO WARNING Q. WE HAVE NO ONE SHOWING UP FOR CURRENTLY THEN WE WILL MOVE ON WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE AND ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS- BYE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. COUNT. SENATOR GLORIA YES YOUR- THANK. YOU VERY MUCH MR CARE I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS FOR BRINGING IT FOR BRINGING THIS. THIS BILL FORWARD. YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT. THE PEOPLE AND COMPANIES ARE GOING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THAT THEY'RE GOING TO RECOGNIZE THE INHERENT VALUE IN DIVERSITY. AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL BECAUSE IF THEY'RE SELLING A PRODUCT OR THEIR- ENGAGING IN SOME KIND OF COMMERCE WHICH THEY ALL ARE. IT'S BETTER TO KNOW WHAT WHAT TO OUT IN THE COMMUNITY AND IT'S BETTER TO KNOW WHAT THE NEEDS ARE AND- AND FRANKLY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE PEOPLE AT THE TABLE SO THAT THE KINDS OF THINGS LIKE IT'S SAID AND DONE DON'T HAPPEN- AND SO I AM I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT STARTS TO MOVE IS TO WORK IN A DIRECTION THAT SAYS LOOK IT IS IMPORTANT DIVERSITY IS IMPORTANT IN CALIFORNIA- AND WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE AT THE TABLE A THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN ORDER TO. BE ABLE TO MAKE REALLY GOOD DECISIONS ON BEHALF OF ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY AND HOPEFULLY WE SERVE AS A MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY ON AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT. WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE STREETS TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED HOPE. A WE NEED ACTION AND- AND THIS IS THE TIME SO I WANT TO THANK YOU I INTEND TO VOTE I AND I'M WANTING COURAGE EVERYBODY ELSE TO DO SO AS WELL. SENATOR CENTER HUESO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE FORWARD THIS IS A HARD BILL MOVE UNDERSTAND WE STARTED OUR EFFORT WHEN YOU WERE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BLACK CAUCUS HOUSE CHAIRMAN LATINO CAUCUS WE WENT OUT TO AND ENGAGE SILICON VALLEY ABOUT HOW. THEY COULD DO MUCH MUCH BETTER AND DIVERSE FIND THEIR BOARDS AND DIVERSE THE WORKFORCE FRANKLY AND SO GLAD TO SEE THIS BILL IS FINALLY HERE AND WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS YOU KNOW I HAVE SHIPBUILDING COMPANY AND- IN MY TRICKLED MASS. THEY'VE BEEN THERE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND THEY ALSO HAVE A- ANOTHER OF YARD IN IN IN THE EASTERN UNITED STATES AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER YARD. IN ASIA. AND THEY'VE ALWAYS FOUND THAT THE- THE SAN DIEGO LOCATION OUTPERFORMS. EVERY OTHER SHIP YARD THEY HAVE LOWER LIABILITIES THEY HAVE HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY AND SO THEY CAN COMMISSION TO STUDY TO FIND OUT WHY THAT THE LOCATION WAS MORE PRODUCTIVE AND THEIR CONCLUSION WAS THAT THEY HAD A MORE DIVERSE WORKFORCE. AND BECAUSE OF THAT THAT THAT THERE WAS OF A- THE DIVERSITY OF IDEAS THAT LEAD TO BETTER PROBLEM SOLVING. AND I THINK THAT IS THE CALIFORNIA SUCCESS STORY WHY CALIFORNIA HAS SO MUCH SUCCESS AND WHY IT HASN'T TRICKLED UP TO THE LEADERSHIP POSITIONS I THINK HAS. REQUIRES SOME INVOLVEMENT TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. I READ A OF US- STORY RIGHT RIGHT BEFORE A REGARDING TO REGARDING THAT THE NAS. HOLDING STAGGERINGLY LOW NUMBER OF BOARD SEATS IN ASSURING BY TONY SHOULD TARNISH APOLOGISTS WANT TO CLARIFY FOR THE PURPOSES OF MESSAGING AND- BECAUSE I WAS A LITTLE BIT- TAKEN ABACK. BY WHAT I READ. BUT I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY AND GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY CLARIFIED YOUR COMMENT. REGARDING THE LATINO COMMUNITY AND YOU HAD SAID THAT THE LEFT A QUOTE IN QUOTES THE LATINO COMMUNITY. IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY IN THIS IS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE- OF THE NEWSPAPER I'M NOT HI I CAN EXPLAIN THE CONTEXT BUT GENERALLY I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU. OF YOUR COMMENT RELATEDTO LIFTING COMMUNITY IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY THERE MAY BE A LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL ISSUE. AND GETTING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. BY JUST GETTING INTO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOL A UNIVERSITY SO I ASSUME BY THAT STATEMENT YOU MET. THECALIFORNIA. LATINO COMMUNITY THERE MAY BE. A LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL ISSUE IN GETTING- EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. BY A OR AN EXPERT BY GETTING INTO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT. ARE YOU WERE YOU SEND THAT. LATINOS HAVE A CULTURAL DATE ARE NOT GETTING INTO THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM BECAUSE OF A LANGUAGE A CULTURAL ISSUE. WHEN YOUGO ON TO SAY ASIANS ARE IN A FIELD FAIRLY DISTANT PUT DECENT POSITION IN MIDDLE OF MIDDLE LEVEL MANAGEMENT POSITIONS ARE CORPORATIONS. FOR THE MOST PART THERE ARE THEY ARE NOT BREAKING INTO THE C. SUITES AND GETTING INTO BOARDS. SO IT'S A DIFFERENT. ISSUE RELATIONS AND BUT I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU TO CLARIFY YOUR COMMENTS OF WHAT YOU MEANT BY THAT. I'M REFLECTING ON THE FACT THAT. OVER 20% OF BLACK AND LATINO YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GRADUATING WITH. THE ABILITY TO STEP INTO THESE POSITIONS WITH SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY BACKGROUNDS BUT IN TERMS OF THE REPRESENTATION WITHIN THESE COMPANIES IT'S WELL BELOW. THE NUMBERS WERE AVAILABLE SO IT'S MAKING THE ARGUMENT THAT THERE IS TALENT THERE TO DRAW FROM IT IS NOT BEING DRAWN TO I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER STATEMENT TO SAY BECAUSE I THAT'S I AGREE WITH TWENTY WHEN YOU WHEN YOUR OUR STATE. PRODUCED AS A POOL 20% LEFT IN PLACE YET WE DON'T HAVE. NAY ANYWHERE NEAR THAT NOT EVEN 10% ARM BARS NOT EVEN 5% ON BOARDS. I THINK THAT THAT IS A MUCH MORE COMPELLING FIGURE BECAUSE I HAVE TO SAY- OF. MAYBE GETTING IN TROUBLE. ACTUATED FROM COLLEGE MAY NOT BE. A REQUIREMENT FOR BEING ON THE CORPORATE BOARD. AND FOR MANY OTHER WHITE PEOPLE IT HASN'T BEEN A REQUIREMENT WAS A REQUIREMENT FOR MIKE MARK ZUCKERBERG ARRAY KRAKOUER BILL GATES OR STEVE JOBS OR STEVE WOZNIAK OR MICHAEL DELL OR JUST A WHOLE LITANY OF PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T HAVE A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS SERVED ON A- ON BOARD. BUT HAD BUSINESS ACT HUMAN AND RUNNING A CORPORATE GREAT CORPORATION REQUIRES SPECIAL SKILLS BUSINESS ACUMEN AND OTHER THINGS AND- SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WASN'T LOST IN THE MESSAGING BUT THAT. THIS IS ABOUT. THIS IS REALLY ABOUT MAKING OUR BUSINESSES MORE COMPETITIVE AND IF THERE IS- CERTAIN ELEMENT HAPPENING AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL THAT IS. BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT HOLDING ON TO POWER NOT NECESSARILY- WORKING IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS TO FUNCTION AT THEIR HIGHEST LEVEL I THINK THIS BILL. MAKES HIS BEST CASE ARGUING THAT OUR OUR CORPORATIONS ARE GOING TO PROVE WHICH I BELIEVE THEY WILL ESPECIALLY WHEN. OF THE OF THE POPULATION THE CONSUMER BASE OF NOT ONLY. THE OUR STATE PART OF THE WORLD IS DIVERSE AND IT REQUIRES PEOPLE OF DIVERSE LANGUAGE AND CULTURE AND IDEAS TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE OUR OWN STATE AND THE REST OF THE WORLD THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WORK I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK IN BRINGING A FOUR. AND IF I IF I COULD MISTER. I JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE CENTER HUESOS. CAN TO THE ISSUE AND WE WERE AS YOU POINTED OUT IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IN THE SILICON VALLEY WITH A GROUP OF. REPRESENTATIVES ARE COMPANIES BUT DID NOT BRING. DID NOT SHOW THE RESPECT OR COURTESY TO THE ISSUE TO BRING THOSE AT THE TOP WERE IN THAT CORPORATE LEVEL. BOARD ROOM TO SIT AND VISIT AND UNDERSTAND. HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR CULTURE CHANGE TO HAPPEN. AND THAT HAPPENS AT THE TOP OF THE DISSEMINATES THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION. SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR- PARTICIPATION THIS YEAR YOU'RE FINGERPRINTS ARE ALL OVER THIS BILL AS WELL THANK YOU. AN THE KEY CENTER DORADO. THANK YOU AND I AGREE WITH ALL OF THE PREVIOUS REMARKS IN TESTIMONY THAT THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN AND THAT IS THAT OBVIOUSLY THE MORE DIVERSE EVERYWHERE IN SOCIETY WE ARE. BETTER HEALTHIER BETTER HEALTHIER SOCIETY BECAUSE IF YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF BOBBY IN THE CORPORATE BOARDROOM OR BEING WHERE EVER YOU WANT TO BE A DOCTOR OR A FARM WORKER IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WE HAVE IS AN INTEGRATED SOCIETY AT ALL LEVELS AND I THINK THAT'S THE VALUE OF THIS. SECOND THING I WANT TO ADD. IS THAT I'M HOPING THAT THAT DIVERSITY LEADS TO A MUCH MORE ETHICAL AND SENSITIVE AW. OF LEADERSHIP BOARDS THAT REALLY CARE ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITIES AND I HOPE. THAT WE CAN LOOK FORWARD TO THAT AS WELL THERE ARE SO MANY NEEDS THROUGHOUT OUR SOCIETY DROP COMMITTEE. ARE IN OUR WHOLE HOPE IS THAT BY HAVING A MORE DIVERSE AS ONE PIECE OF INTEGRATION. THAT BY DOING THIS IN THE CORPORATE BOARDS THEY WILL SEE NOT ONLY HOW TO SELL MORE PRODUCTS BUT HOW TO CARE ABOUT THE COMMUNITY THAT'S BINDER PRODUCTS. AND THAT'S ON ALL LOW WHETHER THEY DO. ALL WHAT WHAT HEALTHCARE EVERYTHING TOM SO THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING THAT DODD THAT COMES OUT OF THIS ALL I'M HOPING THAT IT DOESN'T BECOME JUST A STEPPING STONE FOR A- A BROWN OR BLACKER. API PERSON TO SAY I MADE IT IN THE WORLD HOPEFULLY THAT THE PEOPLE THAT DO GET THESE POSITIONS. ARE MUCH MORE CONNECTED TO OUR COMMUNITY SO THANK YOU BONTA THE OFFICE THANK YOU SENATOR PORTANTINO I HAVE A QUESTION- IN THE LIST OF UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES I DON'T SEE L. G. T. WAS A REASON WHY- THEY WERE THE- VIBRANT TO. AJ BEAUTY COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS ALSO. A STRONG CONSUMER BASE AND I'VE OBVIOUSLY HAVING A BROTHER WHO WAS A- VERY SUCCESSFUL- GAVE BUSINESS LEADER CORIS WHETHER OR NOT INCLUDED AS AN UNDER REPRESENTED. GROUP WELL WORLD BANK QUESTIONS. WHAT DID. BACK IN TWO SIXTEEN IT WAS ALL INCLUDES. AND BECAUSE WE WANT TO TEXT IN UNDER. WHAT THE IMPACTS WERE FOR A VARIETY OF GROUPS- CERTAINLY- CENTER JACKSON'S BILL THAT CAME OUT OF THAT. ARE FOCUSED ON WOMEN BECAUSE IT LANDED IN A TIME OF ME TOO. BECAUSE THERE IS A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING THAT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN SOCIETY WAS HITTING HARD- AT THE ISSUE OF WOMEN AND THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE A STRONG VOICE AND TO BE HEARD IN THE RIVER ARE REPRESENTED- I THINK THAT THAT WAS APPROPRIATE. THIS BILL. EMERGENCE AT A TIME WHERE WE SEE RACIAL TENSION. AND DISCORD AND RACISM IT'S INSTITUTIONALIZED. IN OUR COUNTRY. AND SO THIS BILL WAS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS AT THE WOMEN'S BILL ADDRESSED WOMEN'S ISSUES. AND CONCERNS THIS BILL WAS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS RACIAL ISSUES AS IT IMPACTS ON OUR- PERSPECTIVE I HAVE. SUSAN IT'S HARD TO BREATHE THE SLICK. HI MY PACKED COMMUNICATIONS WITH BILL B. T. A G. TO OUR COMMUNITY AND LEADERSHIP THE CAUCUS SENATOR WINNER. AND WE'RE GONNA WORK TOGETHER ON A DRESSING THE ISSUE GOING FORWARD- BUT I THINK THE TIME IS. SINGULARLY FOCUSED AT THIS MOMENT ON RACE IN AMERICA NOW WE CAN GET OUR ARMS AROUND. IT CONCERNS ME IN IN THE DEFINITION OF UNDER REPRESENTED IN DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION SO I DO HAVE THAT RESERVATION- BUT THANK YOU FOR. BUT THAT I THINK THIS WOULD BE IMPROVED IF IT WAS BROADER NOT. NOT NARROW THAT'S JUST MIKE MIKE POSITION. ANY OTHER CONSEQUENCES FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN CHINA I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS MEASURE- THE ISSUE OF THE ISSUE I SHOULD SAY- DIVERSITY HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN CHAMPIONING SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE OR EVEN SINCE I'VE BEEN ELECTED ON. LOW ON THE LOCAL LEVEL SET LOCAL CITY COUNCIL AND IT'S- A GREAT IMPORT TO ME. A SPECIALIZED OF BEAN THE VICE CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS BUT ALSO. THE WORK ACT- OUR FURNITURE MR HOLDEN IS DONE AS WELL AND AS A PERSON WHO SPENT. TWENTY YEARS IN CORPORATE AMERICA I WAS ALWAYS AMAZED AT THE LACK OF DIVERSITY DESPITE. WARNING THAT DIVERSE CUSTOMERBASE TO BUY YOUR PRODUCT OR SUPPORT YOUR PRODUCT BUT- IN THESE CORPORATIONS YOU VERY RARELY SAW. THE RICH DIVERSITY AND TAPESTRY OF THE STATE OR THIS NATION EVEN HERE IN THIS BUILDING- THAT LOOKS LIKE A BLACK OFFICE A FEW YEARS AGO. HOSTED A HEARING AND WE INVITED CORPORATE CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS TO TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY ONLY TWO SHOWED UP. ONLY TWO SHOWED UP ARE THE BROAD INVITATION. AND WE APPRECIATE THOSE TWO THAT SHOWED UP- BECAUSE IT SHOWED A COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY FOR FAR TOO LONG CORPORATIONS OF SIMPLY CHECK THE BOX. AS IT RELATES TO DIVERSITY AND I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT. H. P. STATED IT'S PART OF THEIR DNA AND IT HAS TO BE PART OF THEIR DNA IF IT'S REALLY GONNA WORK BECAUSE A I THINK OUR DIVERSITY IS OUR STRENGTH NOT ONLY AS A- STATE BUT AS A NATION AND I WAS SOMEWHAT TAKEN. BY MR BISHOP'S COMMENTS THAT HE WAS FEARFUL THAT THIS WOULD DISCRIMINATE AGAINST MEN WELL MEN HAVE BEEN DISCRIMINATING AGAINST WOMEN FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS IN THIS COUNTRY SO I IT'S TIME TO. LEVEL THE PLAYING AND ALLOW FOLKS. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS THAT A SENATOR PORTANTINO'S REYES BECAUSE AGAIN I'VE DONE PLENTY LEGISLATION WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND WE'VE INCLUDED LGBT. AND MUCH OF WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE BUT- IT'S FAR EASIER TO IDENTIFY ONE'S RACE AND GENDER AND DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THAT VERSUS. THE ASSET RANGE. SO I UNDERSTAND THE GOAL THAT MR HOLDEN IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE BECAUSE IT'S NO DOUBT WHEN YOU WALK IN A ROOM THEY KNOW YOUR BLOCK THEY KNOW YOU'RE A WOMAN. SOMETIMES WE DO NOT NO ONE'S. SEXUAL ORIENTATION SO I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE BUT WE HAVE INCLUDED IT IN ALMOST. EVERY BILL I WORKED ON A SAY WITH. ASSURANCE COMMITTEE LAW AND WITH. IT OR ONE FIFTY WITH THE UTILITY MAKING L. G. B. EVEN AN ECONOMY BILL THAT I DID. SB TWELVE NINETY FOUR OF SOCIAL EQUITY WE HAVE INCLUDED IT TILL IT IS BANNED IN JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT I UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE DOING BECAUSE- FAR TOO OFTEN WE SEE FOLKS. BEING EXCLUDED SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THEIR CALLER. SIMPLY BECAUSE WE NEVER GET TO ANYTHING ELSE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER AND FAR TOO OFTEN THEY OFTEN SAY WE CAN'T FINE. I'M ALWAYS BLOWN AWAY WHEN THEY SEE BLACK ENGINEERS THEY SAID WE CAN'T FONG BLOCKING DINNER IS A WORK AT SOME OF THESE HIGH TECH CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES WHEN. THE DOOR IN THE ORGANIZATION AS WE NATIONAL SOCIETY OF BLACK ENGINEERS. THAT. MISTER BLACK COLLEGES GRADUATE. THOUSANDS OF ENGINEERS EVERY YEAR THEY CONTINUE TO SAY THEY CAN'T FIND A CAT FONG BECAUSE I'M NOT LOOKING SO I COMMEND THIS BILL I'M COME IN THIS AUTHORED FOR THIS BILL AND THE- SUPPORTERS OF IT. AND I WAS STRONGLY SUPPORTED AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR MOTIONHERE. I WOULD NOTE THAT MISTER CALDERON TO LIKE CLOSE. IT'S BEEN MOVED BY SEN WHAT MISS HOLDEN ELECTRICAL. GERMAN I DON'T I COULD DO A BETTER CLOSING WHICH SHE WAS. LAID ON THE RECORD I JUST SAY THAT IT DOES TAKE INTENTIONALITY. TO ADDRESS. REYES AND IT'S A STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE. AND WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AND I THINK THAT A. B. NINE SEVEN NINE BUT SETS THE FRAMEWORK FOR CALIFORNIA ANNOUNCER ARRIVAL. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION MOTION AWAY SO WE HAVE TO DO PASSED WITH AMENDMENTS TO BE TAKEN IN APPROPRIATIONS ON MOUNT SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

PORTANTINO THE BILL HAS SIX VOTES IT IS OUT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MR HOLDEN THANK YOU SOMEONE AND GARCIA. NEXT UP IS AB TWELVE ME FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE BY A CINNAMON JONES SAWYER. SEARCHABLE IF. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB THIRTEEN TWENTY FIVE WOULD EXPAND ACCESS TO BANKING AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES FOR THE CANNABIS BUSINESSES THIS WILL HELP BANKS BETTER COMPLY WITH FEDERAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IT ALSO CODIFIES PROTECTIONS UNDER STATE LAW FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT SERVE THE INDUSTRY. DESPITE THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE FEDERAL AND STATE ON CANNABIS IT IS POSSIBLE FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE INDUSTRY. ONLY SEVEN HUNDRED AND TEN BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS IN THE NATION ARE CURRENTLY BANKING TO CANNABIS BUSINESSES. INSTITUTIONS THAT CHOOSE TO BANK FOR CANNABIS BUSINESSES MUST COMPLY WITH RIGOROUS MONITORING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN ACCEPTED SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RISK. THE FINANCIAL CRIMES ENFORCEMENT NETWORK ALSO KNOWN AS CONSENT. REQUIRES THAT BANKS SERVING THE INDUSTRY FILE SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTS TO ENSURE THAT THE BUSINESS DOES NOT VIOLATE ANY STATE LAW. OR IS NOT ENGAGED IN OTHER ACTIVITIES. THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE BURDENSOME AND DEMANDING ON STAFF AND RESOURCES AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY FIVE WOULD ALLOW STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO SHARE A BUSINESS TRACK AND TRACE INFORMATION AND OTHER REGULATORY INFORMATION WITH THE BUSINESS BANKS. ONLY AT THE REQUEST AGAIN ONLY AT THE REQUEST OF THE BUSINESS TO TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM TRACKS ALL CANNABIS PRODUCTS FROM CULTIVATION TO FAIL. THIS INFORMATION ALONG WITH OTHER REGULATORY INFORMATION CAN BE USED BY THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO VERIFY THAT TRANSACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUSINESS PRODUCT IS LEGAL UNDER STATE LAW AND EASE THE BURDEN IN COMPLYING WITH PINSON REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. BASED ON THE SENATE BANKING AND FINANCE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ABOUT ONE IN EVERY FOR CANNABIS BUSINESSES NATIONALLY ARE DENIED ACCESS TO BANKING DUE TO INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN FEDERAL AND STATE LAW AS RELATES TO CANNABIS. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS RESULTS TAX INFORMATION THAT IS THAT THIS BILL WILL AUTHORIZE STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES TO SHARE WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IS INTENDED TO HELP FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. PERFORM THE REQUIRED DUE DILIGENCE MORE READILY THAN THEY CAN AT PRESENT. ADDITIONALLY AB THIRTEEN TWENTY FIVE WRITTEN SIMILAR TO LEGISLATION PASSED IN WASHINGTON STATE WILL CREATE A SAFE HARBOR UNDER STATE LAW TO PROTECT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. AND ACCOUNTANTS THAT PROVIDE FINANCIAL. SERVICES TO THE INDUSTRYANY LOCAL LICENSING AUTHORITY CAN REQUIRE A CANNABIS BUSINESS IN A JURISDICTION TO SHARED A TRACK AND TRACE DATA. TWO AB THIRTEEN TWENTY FIVE DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY BUSINESS TO TURN OVER THEIR TRACK AND TRACE INFORMATION TO ANYONE. THIS BILL IS 1100% VOLUNTARY AND IS ACTIVATED ONLY AT THE EXPLICIT REQUEST OF A CANNABIS BUSINESS. THREE AB THIRTEEN TWENTY FIVE DOES NOT GIVE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACCESS TO FINANCING INFORMATION WITHOUT LIMITS ACCORDING TO THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION THAT IS REASONABLY NECESSARILY NECESSARY TO FACILITATE THE PROVISION OF FINANCIAL SERVICES FOR THE LICENSEE. MAKING A REQUEST FOR THAT BANG TO ACCESS TO TRACK AND TRACE DATA. AB FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE DOES NOT GIVE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THE ABILITY TO DIVULGE STEEL A PROFIT OFF OF TRADE SECRETS OR RECIPES. EIGHTY FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE DOES NOT EMPOWER CANNABIS BUSINESSES. BY GIVING THEM THE OPTION TO SHARE TO TRACK AND TRACE DATA WITH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION OF THEIR CHOICE FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING FINANCIAL SERVICES. AND FINALLY AB FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE IS NECESSARY BECAUSE ENFORCING CANNABIS BUSINESSES TO RELY ON A ON A CASH ONLY SYSTEM. IS A PUBLIC SAFETY RISK THIS BILL WILL POP UP ILLEGAL CANNABIS BUSINESS MAKE IT EASIER FOR BUSINESS TO RUN AND PAID THEIR TAXES THIS BILL SUPPORTED BY INDUSTRY GROUPS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALIKE. READ THE NECESSARY OF THIS LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO FINANCIAL SERVICES WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS ROBERT RECOGNITION FROM THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE. MEMBERS ARE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. OUR MODERATOR CAN USE FIFTH MISTER WILSON IS PREPARED TO TESTIFY. OF COURSE OF THE MORNING AND WE WILL PROVIDE HIM TWO MINUTES OF TESTIMONY ON BEHALF OF.

OF STATE GOVERNMENT PAYERS CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK IMPORT EXPORT AB FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE AB FIFTY TWENTY FIVE WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BANKING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CREDIT UNIONS IN CAMPUS PLACEMENTS WITHIN THE STATE AUTOMATED DIFFICULT AND COSLY. BANK CAN EXPECT BECAUSE WHICH IS CREATING HARDSHIP FOR THE LEGAL INDUSTRY. THANK COMMUNITY BASED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. I DON'T THINK CANNABIS BUSINESSES TO HELP OUR COMMUNITIES AND TO KEEP THEM SAFE BY KEEPING LARGE AMOUNTS OF CASH OFF THE STREET. WE ARE RESTRICTED FROM DOING SO BECAUSE DIFFICULT TO ACCESS FINANCIAL INFORMATION WE NEED TO MEET FEDERAL BANKING GUIDELINES. AB FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE CRITICS SAY FARTHER UNDER STATE LAW TO PROTECT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT PROVIDES FINANCIAL SERVICES TO THE INDUSTRY. BILL ALSO GIVES CANNABIS BUSINESSES THE ABILITY TO SHARE THEIR TRACK AND TRACE IT UP WITH A BANK OR CREDIT UNION OF THEIR CHOICE SO THAT THEIR FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDER IS ABLE TO COMPLY WITH KANSEN REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THE ONLY BE DONE AT THE EXPRESS REQUEST OF THE LIGHT COMPETE. SEE YOU PROBABLY BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL LEAD TO AN INCREASED NUMBER OF CANNABIS BUSINESSES BIG BANK IN THE STATE.

ARAMBULA FOLLOWING THREE AB. FIFTEEN FIFTY ONE. ARTICLE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY ONE IS A BIPARTISAN BILL WITH NARY A NO VOTE WITH A RIDE WIDE RANGE OF SUPPORT FROM ADVOCACY GROUPS AND ASSOCIATIONS AB FIFTEEN FIFTY ONE PROPOSES MAKING THREE CHANGES TO THE PROPERTY ASSESSMENT CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAM KNOWN AS PACE FINANCING. FIRST IT REQUIRES PEACE ADMINISTRATORS TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH A HARD COPY OF THE CONTRACT PRIOR TO ANY WORK COMMENCING. REQUIRING A PAPER COPY OF THE DISCLOSURE WILL PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONDITIONS OF THE PACE CONTRACT IMPORTANTLY AHARD COPY WILL ALLOW THE PROPERTY OWNER TO IDENTIFY TO READILY SHARE THE DISCLOSURE WITH TRUSTED FRIENDS AND RELATIVES. SECOND THIS BILL PROVIDES PROHIBITS PACE ADMINISTRATORS FROM CHARGING CONSUMERS A PENALTY FOR PAYING OFF THEIR ASSESSMENTS EARLY. THE EARLY PAYOFF PENALTIES INCREASES THE COST OF THE FINANCING AND ROBS HOMEOWNERS OF THE HARD EARNED EQUITY IN THEIR HOMES. FINALLY THIS BILL WILL PROHIBIT PACE ADMINISTRATORS FROM CONTRACTING WITH HOMEOWNERS WHO HAVE REVERSE MORTGAGES. AS HOME IMPROVEMENTS QUALIFY AS SUPER LEANS AGAINST A HOME RESIDENTS MAY FIND THEMSELVES IN DEBT LOSING HOME EQUITY AND I'M ABLE TO SELL THEIR HOME. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT THIS PRACTICE IS ENDED. THERE IS A DIGITAL DIVIDE IN OUR STATE. OLDER AND LOW INCOME RESIDENTS SOME OF WHOM. MAY NOT BE NON ENGLISH SPEAKING. AT LIVE PREDOMINATELY IN DISTRICTS LIKE MINE CANNOT ACCESS ELECTRONIC DISCLOSURES FROM THEIR HOMES. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TROUBLING DURING THE STAY AT HOME PROTOCOLS. IT IS MY HOPE THAT THIS BILL WILL MAKE PACE A BETTER PRODUCT BY PROVIDING HOMEOWNERS WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND TRANSPARENCY NECESSARY BEFORE ENTERING INTO PACE ASSESSMENT CONTRACTS. WELL I BELIEVE THAT A HARD COPY OF THE PIECE DISCLOSURE IS NECESSARY FOR THE PROTECTION OF VULNERABLE CONSUMERS I THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR SUGGESTED AND MOMENTS AND WILL ACCEPT EITHER VERSION HERE TODAY. THANK YOU AND I URGED HER AYE VOTE HERE TO TESTIFY VIA PHONE OR STACY L. PART DIRECTOR OF THE CONSUMER LAW CLINIC AT UC IRVINE AND LULU LEAVE A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER WITH THE DELORES HUERTA FOUNDATION. AND A BOX WITH THE BILL'S SPONSOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IS ALSO ON THE LINE AND AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. THANK YOU A FEW PRIMARY WITNESS MISSED CUT OR A LEVERAGE PREPARED WE WILL HEAR FROM THEM WE ARE EACH BE GIVEN TO MANAGE TESTIMONY. MODERATOR THERE ARE THE CUTE. THEY ARE BOTH OF THEIR LINES ARE OPEN. YEAH GO FIRST THE THIRTY MILLION ON MY SALUTE YOU MAY GO FIRST. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS LIEUTENANT BELIEVE THAT AN ORGANIZED WITH AT THE MOMENT WHERE THE FOUNDATION AND IT IS HERE IN SUPPORT THAT I GO FOR A B. ONE FIVE FIVE ONE. I'M HERE AT THE WITNESS OF THE PAIN THIS. PAPERS THAT HAVE DONE TO OUR FAMILIES I HAVE PERSONALLY SEEN HOW THEY HAVE SUFFERED MENTAL DISTRESS ECONOMICAL CRISIS AND EVEN DEATH BECAUSE THEY DID NOT FEEL UNDERSTOOD FOR HELP. THEY WERE HELPLESS AND VULNERABLE ALL BECAUSE OF THE PACE WITH THAT. THEY DID NOT KNOW OR UNDERSTAND. A HARD COPY WITH NEVER IS. OR EVEN AT THE COPY BECAUSE THEY HAD NO PROPER DOCUMENTS TO TELL THEM HOW THEY GOT INTO A PROPERTY TAX BILL INCREASE OR WIDE THEIR HOME MORTGAGE BILL WENT UP. ALL BECAUSE OF THIS SUPER LEAN. THIS BILL IS MINIMAL BUT WILL SAVE LIVES. RED MEAT BEING THE FAMILIES WHO ARE IMMIGRANTS FIRST TIME HOMEOWNERS AND MAYBE THE ONLY TIME TO BUY A HOME AND KNOWING THAT THEY WOULD BE THIS TO THEIR CHILDREN AND NOW THIS WAS IN. TROUBLE BASED LOAN ASSESSMENT. THEY CALL THEM HAVE NOT DISCLOSED FAIRLY TO ALL. IT IS NOW THAT WE CAN TAKE THIS ACTION AND I ASKED YOUR AVAILABLE ALL RIGHT BECAUSE WE CAN HELP AMERICA AND WE COULD HAVE HEALTH. GOOD BUT- IF YOU. AB FIVE FIVE ONE HELP OUR FAMILY GET STOCKS THAT THEY NEED IN THEIR HEAD. WE FOR ME AND ARE GONNA YOU CAN HELP THEM. PLEASE VOTE I THE BILL THANK YOU. OUR NEXT WITNESS MISTER. FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR IN MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY AS THE DIRECTOR OF UC IRVINE CONSUMER LAW CLINIC I'M HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF MY CLIENTS ONLY TWO YEARS AGO I LAUNCHED THE CLINIC AND HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS AND SELECT THE MOST SALIENT CONSUMER PROBLEM AND OUR FOCUS. THE ISSUE THAT CAME UP AGAIN AND AGAIN WERE OLDER ADULTS FIFTEEN HOMELESSNESS TO A CASE ASSESSMENT WHY WAS THIS THE CASE BECAUSE THE OLDER ADULTS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY AND HAD NO IDEA GOVERNMENT PROGRAM THEY WERE IN ROLLING THEN. THEY WERE NEVER EVEN THEY NEVER EVEN SOUGHT OR EXECUTED THE CONTRACT FURTHER COMPLICATING MATTERS OF THE OVER PRICED FINANCING LEFT THIRTEEN YEARS ON FIXED INCOME STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN THEIR PROPERTY TAXES AND FACING FORECLOSURE BY THE REVERSE MORTGAGE SERVICERS WITHIN A YEAR AGO THE CLINIC WE HAD THIS DOWN OUR INTO BECAUSE THE OVERWHELMING NEED NOW EVERY DAY WE STRUGGLE TO KEEP SENIORS IN THEIR HOME.

THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE SHE RECEIVED NO WRITTEN DISCLOSURES OUR CONTRACT INSTEAD THE TRANSACTIONS WERE DONE USING EMAIL ADDRESS NON AT HERO FINANCING NOW IN THE THROES OF A PANDEMIC MISBACH STAR HAS RECEIVED A NOTICE OF FORECLOSURE SALE THROUGH LITIGATION WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT SPONSOR IS NOT THE ONLY ONE IN FACT A RECENT DECLARATION REVEALS THAT THE NOT A HERO FINANCED EMAIL ADDRESS WOULD YOU OVER.

HEY DUDE YOU'RE BRED PRETTY COMMITTEE MEMBERS MARGARET LATCHING FLORIDIANS NATURE WHO HAS AN IMPOSING LESSON EDUCATION AS YOU KNOW THE PACE PROGRAM STARTED AS A WAY TO HELP HOMEOWNERS FINANCE ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS THE PROGRAM NOW ALSO COVERS WATER CONSERVATION FIRE HARDY pCUSTOMERS TO REDUCE THEIR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY OVER ONE POINT TWO MILLION METRIC TONS IN SAVED OVER TWO MILLION GALLONS OF WATER. IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED SO FORCING THAT GET PASTE BILLS THAT REQUIRE LICENSING IT PROVIDES VERY STRONG PUSH CONNECTED CONSUMER PROTECTIONS STRONGER THAN ALMOST EVERY OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCT THIS BILL CONTINUES AN EFFORT IN REDUCE DOES NOT POSE A THREAT TO PROHIBITIONS ON PREPAYMENT PENALTIES WERE INTO TO CALL WITH PROPERTY OWNERS WHO HAVE REVERSE MORTGAGES HOWEVER THE BILL MANDATES THAT ALL HOMEOWNERS BE PROVIDED PAPER COPY OF CERTAIN. DOCUMENTS AS YOU REJECTED PROVISION AND I PROP OWNERS TO SEE DOCUMENTS. ELECTRO IF YOU FACE CHOOSE WE KNEW GIVES CONSUMER THE BILL TO GET A PAPER CUT. AND ONLY TROOPERS OF HOME ARE TO DO SO. WE BELIEVE BBL HAS IT RIGHT THEIR GROUP GREG. GOVERNING THE REQUIRED DISCLOSURE. D. B. O. RECOGNIZES THE PAPERLESS CONTRACTING IS A VIABLE OPTION UNLESS THE DISCO IF YOU WERE ONCE A PAPER COPY. AND AS POINTED OUT IN THE COMMITTEES WELL WRITTEN IN THE HOUSE OF. THEIR REGULATIONS PUT IN PLENTY OF GUARDRAILS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. BECAUSE WITH NINETEEN WE CAN DEMONSTRATE JUST HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR CONSUMERS HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND TO HAVE CONTACTLESS IN PAPERLESS FINANCIAL SERVICES. THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD NOT PROHIBIT THIS OPTION ESPECIALLY DURING THESE TIMES AS IT WILL ONLY SERVE TO HARM CONSUMERS NOT PROTECTED. THEREFORE WE STRONGLY URGE EIGHTY FIFTEEN FIFTY NINE BE AMENDED DISCUSS ANALYSIS IN SECTION SEVENTY. FINANCIAL IN THE TIRE INDUSTRY WILL REMEMBER OPPOSITION TO THIS AMENDMENT IS TAKE. ME OFF THE WILL HAVE A STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. THANK YOU. WITH THANK YOU BRAD AND MEMBER MY NAME IS KHAN BISHOP I NEED DIRECTOR OF PAY NATION THE NATIONAL OR THE REPRESENTS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS TO SUPPORT PAGE. A. URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON AB FIFTEEN FIFTY ONE UNLESS A PROVISION REQUIRING PAPER ONLY DOCUMENTS IS AMENDED TO ALLOW PAPER DOCUMENTS. AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENT ONLY A HOMEOWNER REQUEST THEM. THIS IS REFLECTED IN OPTION B. IN THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCERS. CASE NATION SUPPORTS THE CONSUMER PROTECTION INTENT BEHIND EIGHTY FIFTEEN FIFTY ONE. HOWEVER AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED. ONE PROVISION IN THE BILL WOULD STRIP AWAY A PROPERTY OWNERS CURRENT RIGHT TO RECEIVE CERTAIN PAGE DOCUMENTS IN THE FORMAT DAY EXPRESSLY AGREE TO RECEIVE THEM. AND WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM UTILIZED UTILIZING CONTACTLESS AND PAPERLESS ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY ONE GET A POLICY EXACTLY WRONG DURING THE COLD AT NINETEEN PANDEMIC WHEN GOVERNMENTS AND BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD ARE MOVING TO SAFER CONTACTLESS AND PEOPLE'S TRANSACTIONS. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL COMPLEX WITH THE DPO CURRENT WILL MAKING ON PACE WHICH ADDRESSES THE CODE SECTION IT. ESTABLISHES REGULATIONS FOR HOW DOCUMENTS CAN BE. PROVIDED ELECTRONICALLY. THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE IN. RIGHTLY OUT THAT EVEN RESIDENTIAL MORE THIS DOC MAYBE PROVIDED ELECTRONICALLY UNDER FEDERAL LAW. GIVEN THE MUCH LARGER SIZE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF HOME MORTGAGE MORTGAGES COMPARED TO PACE ASSESSMENTS CALIFORNIA SHOULD FOLLOW THIS FEDERAL PRECEDENT. THE COMMITTEE SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT SENATE BILL TWO FORTY TWO ALREADY REQUIRES PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS TO GO OVER EACH KEY TERM OF THE PACE FINANCING AGREEMENT WITH THE PROPERTY OWNER ON A LIVE RECORDED PHONE CALL. IN THE PROPERTY OWNERS CHOSE THE LANGUAGE PRIOR TO EXECUTING AN ASSESSMENT CONTRACT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS AB FIFTEEN FIFTY ONE WILL LIMIT ACCESS TO PAY EXTRA FAMILY TO INCREASINGLY DESIRE CONTACTLESS AND PAPERLESS SERVICES AND NEED ACCESS TO CAPITAL CRITICAL COMPONENTS. REALLY PAY STATION RECKON AB COULD FIFTEEN BE AMENDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OPTION BE TO REINSERT THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY OWNERS TO RECEIVE DOCUMENTS IN HARD COPY. OR ELECTRONIC COPY ONLY IF THEY CHOOSE TO AND TO ALLOW THE DPO TO CONTINUE ITS RULE MAKING ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.

THANK YOU MAX WHAT NOW WE HAVE NO FURTHER IN Q. OKAY CENTER DELEGATE YOUR QUESTION FIRST I DO THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO. LOOK THERE'S A GOOD PROGRAM OBVIOUSLY THERE'S BEEN SOME ABUSES AND WE'VE SEEN THAT OVER THE TIME AND I AND I. SHE WAS THE COSPONSORS IN YOURSELF OR TRYING TO DO YOUR- JOB BUT I'M LITTLE BIT CONFUSED ON. THE AMENDMENTS A. N. B. WHAT I WHAT I WANT IS THE OPTION FOR. SOMEONE TO I THINK WE SHOULD SAY YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT IN WRITING IN LESS YOU'VE SIGNED SOMETHING IN AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CAN HAVE THE OPTION TO HAVE IT IN FULL PRINT OR ELECTRONIC VERSION AS WELL. THAT TO ME WOULD MAKE SENSE THAT THEY KNOW HEY I CAN HAVE IT IN PAPER OR ITS MANDATORY PAPER UNLESS THEY ASK OTHERWISE I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE MOST PEOPLE HAPPY. INCLUDING MYSELF I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IS YOU KNOW THAT IS PROVIDED IN THE LANGUAGES THEY SPEAK AND THOSE BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S PEOPLE ARE BAR PREDATORY IN THIS IN THIS AREA TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO AND THESE ARE LONG TERM COMMITMENTS. AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE SEEN LOTS OF LEGISLATION WE HAVE IT IN OUR ANALYSIS HERE OF TRYING TO CLEAN UP THOSE BAD ACTORS BUT THERE THERE IS A LOT OF. GREAT OPPORTUNITIES AND TO BE ABLE TO. YOU KNOW WHETHER IS YOUR HOME AND REDUCE YOUR HEATING BILL OR YOUR AIR CONDITIONING BILL UNDER THESE THESE PROGRAMS I THINK THAT WE NEED TO TEACH AND ICE I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO THREAD THE NEEDLE THERE SO I. I'M TRYING TO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE OF THESE. WOULD DO THAT AND I DON'T THINK EITHER ONE OF THEM ACTUALLY DO THAT I THINK IT SAYS. UNDER A THAT. THAT WOULD BE WHAT ARE THE FED IS BENEFICIAL TO THE CONSUMER AND INNER B. AT THE AMENDMENTS WOULD BE- IF THEY OPT OUT SO I WILL MARK MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE YOU GET PAPER UNLESS YOU SAY IN WRITING I DON'T WANT IT I WANT TO LET TRONG TH SO I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONES DOES THAT THE MOVIE CONFUSED IF SOMEONE COULD HELP ME OUT. THANKS SENATOR PROBABLY ARE. THE SOUL- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. HAVE ALWAYS SET THE PACE PROGRAM IS AN EXCELLENT WAY TO CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO- UPGRADE. THE NOT ONLY THE WEATHER IS WEATHER IS ATION BUT THEIR KINDS OF IT. GOOD CLIMATE CHANGE TYPE OF- OF FEATURES WHETHER IT'S WATER REDUCTION OR WHETHER IT'S SOLAR ENERGY- MANY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE CASH UP FRONT AND THEY DON'T THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS UNLESS UNLESS THERE'S A PEACE PROGRAM BUT THAT HAVING BEEN SAID. WHAT IS IT WHAT HAS EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS IS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE WILLING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. AND MAKE A SALE YEAH REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE INDIVIDUAL UNDERSTANDS WHAT IT IS THEY'RE PURCHASING UNDERSTANDS THAT THE LOAN IS GOING TO END UP GOING ON THEIR ON THEIR HOME AND THAT IT IS SOON TO FIRST POSITION WHEN TAXES ARE PAID AND THAT IT'S GOING TO INCREASE THE COST AT THE TIME THAT THEY PAY THEIR TAXES AND THEY CAN'T JUST PAY ONE AND THE OTHER. IT GOES IN IN TO DEFY YOU PAY YOU DEFAULT ON YOUR TAXES AND ONCE THAT STARTS HAPPENING IT JUST STARTS THE SNOWBALL ROLLING AND SO- I I'M I'M GONNA TELL YOU TODAY THAT I SUPPORT ANYTHING IN WRITING BECAUSE I IT'S AN IF YOU'RE GONNA SELL ME PRODUCT IT'S GOING TO END UP ON MY TAXES AND THAT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO PAY. OR WHOEVER IT IS A BITES MY HOME- FOR YEARS TO COME. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CHANCE TO REVIEW THAT WITH SOMEBODY AND TAKING THE PAPER WORK IN AND SITTING DOWN AND HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT IT'S PROBABLY A REALLY GOOD THING AND THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY SELL IT TO SOMEONE WHO'S GOT A REVERSE MORTGAGE. IS TO ME AND CONSCIONABLE BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE YOU'VE TAKEN A REVERSE MORTGAGE. THAT WILL IGNORE TO THE DETRIMENT OF YOUR ERRORS. WHEN YOU PASS ON. THAT DIED- YOU YOU ARE YOU'RE TAKING MONEY OUT OF YOUR HOME IN ORDER TO SUPPORT YOURSELF. AND SO- THAT TO ADD TO THAT THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME SO I WANT TO JUST SAY THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW IT'S A LOT EASIER TO DO THINGS- LIKE CHRONICALLY. I'M SORRY BUT I'M A HARD PAPER KIND OF PERSON I WONDER WHEN I READ SOMETHING ON A COMPUTER IT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHEN I READ IT IN WRITING. AND PEOPLE AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY I THINK SO I'M I I'M I'M I BELIEVE THAT. IN A. HE SAID. AND IF AGREEABLE THERE WILL BE ELSE AT THAT'S THE DIRECTION I'D LIKE TO SEE IF ON ON THINK IT IS IT EASIER TO DO THINGS ELECTRON OPS. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THERE. IF WITH THE EDUCATION THAT I HAVE I LIKE TO READ THINGS IN PAPER THEN I THINK THAT WE SHOULD EXTEND IT TO ANYBODY AND- PART OF THE CHALLENGE. IS THAT. IT MAY SAY YOU HAVE THE OPTION TO RECEIVE THIS ELECTRONICALLY OR NOT BUT THAT'S NOT TOLD PEOPLE. THAT WOULD THEIR TOLD HERE'S HOW WE DO THIS PROCESS AND SIGN RIGHT HERE AND MUCH PUT YOUR SIGNATURE YEAR YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATE HUESO. THANK YOU OF ALSO. WELL I GUESS WE'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE HERE IN TERMS OF HIS COMMITTEE MAYBE WE COULD GET TO A POINT THAT MAKES SENSE AND FIRST OF ALL I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I WANT TO SUPPORT IT I JUST WANT YOU TO ACQUIRE AND CO THE TO RIDE AND A LOT MORE BUSINESS IS TAKING. AS THROUGH EMAIL. AND HI I JUST THINK THAT. IT JUST MAKES SENSE SAVES A LOT OF MONEY AND PAPER AND- HASSLE TO USE THE- EMAIL AND- BUT ALSO. FOR THOSE PEOPLE. THAT TONE OF. HAVE EMAIL OR OR A WAY TO PRINT ANYTHING FROM YOU CAN HAVE A PHONE OR A COMPUTER NOT HAVE ANYWAY TO REALLY PRINT THAT AND I KNOW THAT'S- THAT HAPPENS AS WELL. PER COPY I THINK IS APPROPRIATE I PUT AN AIR CONDITIONER IN MY HOUSE AND WASN'T AS MUCH AS A- OF THOSE IS ACTUALLY A SMALL CONTRACT BUT IF THEY GIVE ME CONTRAI DIDN'T REQUESTED BUT I SIGNED ONE THEY GAVE ME A COPY AND IT WAS A DIFFICULT IF THERE IS A CONTRACT. HE SHOULD BE. A CONTRACT THAT'S AVAILABLE TO REVIEW I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT IS. THE CHALLENGE BUT FIVE I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT. MAY BE YOU KNOW WHICH SITS I LIKE I LIKE A COMBINATION OF THE AMENDMENTS ONE THAT REPORT STATED THAT THE IN THE- THE PERSON IS INFORMED THAT EXISTING LAW REQUIRES. THAT A HARD COPY THE STOCK MAY BE PROVIDED TO BEFORE. ARE REVIEWING AND SIGNING ON AND THAT JUST SEEMS VERY REASONABLE TO ME THAT THAT COULD HAVE A COPY IN A CHANCE TO READ. WHAT WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SIGN AND IF THEY'RE MAKING AVAILABLE SIGN IT TO YOU I DON'T KNOW. IT JUST SEEMS FAIR TO ME. BUT ALSO A PROVISION THAT ALLOWS YOU TO REQUEST. THAT IT BE SENT TO YOU BY EMAIL I THINK IS ALSO REASONABLE AND THAT SHOULD BE. AND SO THEN WHEN YOU ARE GIVEN THE CHANCE THAT- THAT THE DISCLOSURE BE PROVIDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE UNIVERSITY. YOUTH WITH THE UNIFORM OF THE CHRONIC TRANSACTIONS ACT ITSELF. I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT WAS NECESSARILY STRICKEN I IT BUT- IN THIS ENVIRONMENT COVE IT- IT SHOULD BE AN OPTION ESPECIALLY IF PEOPLE. IF THEY WERE THERE FOR THE FORCED TO SIGN SOMETHING- THAT SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE DONE YOU PROBABLY THROUGH THE MAIL. IN THIS ENVIRONMENT SOME PEOPLE CONSIGNED THINGS ELECTRONICALLY NOW. OF THE VALID DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN SIGNED ELECTRONICALLY ALL THE TIME AND A NOTARIZED AS WELL SO. SO I DON'T KNOW HOW WE RESOLVE THIS MISTER CHAIR BUT IF THERE'S A COMBINATION OF WITH A BALANCE SO WE CAN STRIKE HERE TO MAKE SENSE FOR BUT I WOULD LOVE TO SPORT AND I KIND OF WAS. I KIND OF ASSUME THAT. THEY WORK THEY WORK TOGETHER AND MAKE IT HAPPEN SECTION BUT I'M SURE THERE'S A WAY WE CAN FIND I CAN SHOW THEM. THAT'S POSSIBLE WE COULD PROBABLY. SPLIT THE SPLIT THE BAY HERE. IS THERE ANY OTHER. WELL THANK YOU I TO A TACTILE PERSON AND PSALMS COPIER I LIKE TO READ I LIKE TO HAVE A DOCUMENT IN FRONT OF ME I LIKE TO TOUCH AND FEEL IT. AND BUT I ALSO UNDERSTANDING THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE PEOPLE ON THE GO AND ON THE MOVE AND ELECTRONIC. DEVICES AND HAVING SOMETHING LIKE CHRONICALLY ARE PERMITTED- PROVIDED I SHOULD SAY IS A GREAT CONVENE FOR SOME WHAT I WOULD LIKE IF WE CAN HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS IS THAT. THE PAPER BE THE FIRST OPTION UNLESS SOMEONE CHOOSES TO OPT OUT FOR ELECTRONIC COPIES SO IF WE HAVE AN AMENDMENT. THAT CLEARLY STATES THAT. PAPER WOULD BE THE FIRST OPTION ONE. OTHERWISE STOP ACTING LIKE OPT OUT CLAUSE IF THEY CAN OPT OUT OF LUCK THE PAPER ADDED LIKE TRYING TO CREATE I NEED SOMEONE TO FIRMLY STATE THAT WE WATER ELECTRONICALLY AND IF NOT. THAT'S FINE YEAH. IS MOMMY YEAH CAN WE ALL AGREE UPON THAT YES SENATE ALLEN HELLO LET ME BE CLEAR S. C. ACTS LIKE THINK WHAT I ASKED IS IT THE FIRST OPTIONS PAPER AND THEY HAVE TO SIGN TO THIS IS NOT A ONE PAPER.

THIS BILL EXTENDS A SUNSET OF THE PILOT PROGRAM FOR THE INCREASE ACCESS TO RESPONSIBLE SMALL DOLLAR LOANS TO JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. AND TWENTY TEN THE LEGISLATOR CREATED A PILOT PROGRAM WITH THE INTENT OF CRICKET CAN INCREASING CONSUMER ACCESS TO SMALL DOLLAR LOANS. WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT THESE LOANS HAD STRONG MEANINGFUL CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY TWENTY DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT REPORT OF A THREE YEAR PERIOD BETWEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN. NEARLY SIXTY PERCENT. OF MULTIPLE LUMBAR SAW THEIR CREDIT SCORE INCREASE ADDITIONALLY. THE LOAN PRINCIPAL. THE TOTAL PRINCIPLE OF LOANS MADE IN THOSE YEARS INCREASE FROM TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION TO FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT MILLION. EMONSTRATING AN INCREASED NEED FOR CAPITAL HOWEVER THE PILOT PROGRAM SET TO SUNSET AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY SO THIS IS EFFECTIVELY- THE YEAR THAT WE HAVE TO- RESET THE CLOCK SO THAT. THIS PROGRAM COULD CONTINUE THE PILOT PROGRAM IS DEMONSTRATED THAT CAN PRODUCE A GOOD SAFE CONSUMER LOAN PRODUCTS THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE THE DPO WITH AN ADDITIONAL TIME TO COLLECT DATA. TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHETHER TO MAKE THE PROGRAM PERMANENT ENSURE CONSUMERS CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO A LOAN PRODUCT THAT IS THE GOLD STANDARD IN COMPUTER.

OUR MISSION IS TO ERADICATE ECONOMIC INJUSTICE BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO PORTABLE CAPITAL AND THIS ISSUE HAS NEVER BEEN MORE CRITICAL AND NOW DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT BILL PERFUMERY FIRST THE PILOT PROGRAM HAS ACHIEVED IMPRESSIVE OUTCOMES TO BE TRYING TO CREATE. A PAYDAY LOAN AND UNDERBANKED COMMUNITIES BILL CREDIT. AND HAS DONE. HELLO A GROUP.

OKAY THANK YOU. SMALL PUREE. ONE MOMENT AND WE'LL HAVE THEM ON. MISTER BORDERLINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU MY NAME IS NICOLE AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF CONSUMER FINANCE THAT THE FUTURE OF THE CULTURE. GEN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WE HAVE RESEARCHED OF HATING SMALL DOLLAR LOAN MARKET EXTENSIVELY. AND WE PUBLISHED NUMEROUS REPORTS AND ANALYSES ON THE TOPIC. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT CRITERIA FOR CONSUMER SIX UP WITH SMALL ARMS OF THE FOLLOWING. ONE HAVING ENOUGH TIME TO RECALL. Q. SMALL INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS. THREE AMORTIZATION THAT IS EACH PAYMENT REDUCES THE PRINCIPLE AND FOR FAIR PRICES WHICH MEANS IN THIS CONTEXT BUT CALL ME A FRACTION OF WHAT PAID A ANOTHER SUB PRIME LENDERS CHARGE SIMILAR CUSTOMERS. A PILOT PROGRAM MEETS THESE CRITERIA THEREFORE BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS Q. SUPPORTS MAKING THE PILOT PROGRAM COMING. SADLY CALIFORNIA'S FLOODED WITH INTEREST RATES TO BORROW MONEY INCLUDING FEE BASED OVERDRAFT ON. AND OF COURSE A LOT CALIFORNIA COULD KERR BARS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS. THREE SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLARS THE LENDER BY THE TIME THEY FIND THEIR WAY OUT OF THAT. ABOUT SIX MONTHS LATER. FIVE HUNDRED FORTY DOLLARS FINANCE CHARGES. BUT UNDER THE PILOT PROGRAM THE SAME PERSON COULD BORROW DOUBLE THE AMOUNT AND PAY ONLY ABOUT NINETY DOLLARS TO FINANCE CHARGES SIX TIMES LAST. THEY GET THE BENEFIT OF CLEARLY DISCLOSED PROPERLY AMORTIZING INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS. ALMOST PAID A LUMP OF THE YARD AND 310024100% MOST PILOT LOANS HAVE EIGHT YARDS LESS THAN 50% THE REPORT SHOW THE DELINQUENCY TECH REMAINS LOW AND MOST BORROWERS WERE INCREASING THEIR CREDIT SCORES. THE PROGRAM IS NOT PERFECT AND DOES NOT MEET ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS. PUBLISHED BUT THE PROGRAM IS SOUND. IRONICALLY ONE OF THE GREATEST WEAKNESSES MAYBE EXPECT INTEREST RATE STRUCTURE WHICH MAY THREATEN THE VIABILITY OVER TIME ONE POSSIBLE MEASURES AGREES THE PILOT DURABILITY AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE CREDIT. WOULD BE TO KEEP THE CURRENT FEE STRUCTRE BUT CHANGE THE INTEREST RATE STRUCTURE TO MATCH AB FIVE THIRTY NINE THAT FOR CONSUMER FINANCE LOANS LAST YEAR. THAT NEWLY ENACTED LAW CAPS CONSUMER FINANCE LOAN INTEREST AT 36% WHAT'S THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE. IN CONCLUSION CONSIDERING THAT THESE ARE ON LOAN MADE TO PEOPLE WITH LOWER NAY CREDIT. WE FIND THAT THE ONLY RATES ARE MODEST CREDIT SCORE INCREASES ARE LARGE AND LOW COST OR LOW COMPARED TO THE OTHER OPTIONS ON THE MARKET. BASED ON THIS ANALYSIS AND THEN YEARS OF RESEARCH ON STEEL Q.
