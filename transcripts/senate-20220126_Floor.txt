MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO BY SENATOR ALAN AN ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECTS SENATOR ALAN THE FLOOR IS YOURS MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT PLACES A MEASURE ON A FUTURE STATEWIDE BALLOT. ASKING VOTERS TO REPEAL ARTICLE THIRTY FOR THE CALIFORNIA. CONSTITUTION NOW PROVED IN- EIGHT NINETEEN FIFTY BY VOTERS ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR REQUIRES MAJORITY APPROVAL BY THE VOTERS OF THE CITY OR COUNTY TO DEVELOP CONSTRUCT. OR ACQUIRE A PUBLICLY FUNDED LOW RENT HOUSING PROJECTS. CALIFORNIA HAS TWENTY TWO AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE RENTAL HOMES FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. NEARLY 40% OF CALIFORNIANS LIVE NEAR OR BELOW THE POVERTY LINE A MAJORITY OF OUR STATES RENTER'S SPENT MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR INCOME. ON HOUSING NEARLY ONE THIRD SPEND MORE THAN HALF. TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE ONE MISSED PAYCHECK AWAY FROM HOMELESSNESS. NO THE SEVEN DECADES SINCE ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR WAS ESTABLISHED CALIFORNIA'S VOTERS OF TIME AND AGAIN MADE IT CLEAR THEY WANT THEIR LEADERS TO DO BETTER. BY THOSE WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO AFFORD HOUSING SUPPORTING BALLOT MEASURES THAT DEDICATE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF. TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO TACKLING THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. CRISIS AT THE STATE OWES IT TO ALL TAXPAYERS TO USE THE MONEY AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE- I CA EXPERIENCE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT EACH COMMITTEE HAS NO NO VOTES AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU- BROWN PRESIDENT I AM A PROUD I JOIN AUTHOR OF A CA TO- AND I'M THRILLED THAT WE- I HOPE TO MOVE THIS FORWARD- TODAY THIS IS SO LONG OVERDUE- THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IS AN ABSOLUTE SCAR ON THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION- THE END CAME DURING A VERY UGLY TIME PERIOD IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY IN TERMS OF EFFORTS TO END SEGREGATION AND- BACKLASH- AGAINST- THOSE EFFORTS- AND IT'S SO PERNICIOUS BECAUSE- ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR. IT SINGLES OUT ONLY ONE KIND OF HOUSING. FOR MANDATORY- REPLACEMENT BEFORE THE VOTERS ON ELECTION. DOESN'T SAY ALL HOUSING ONLY ONE KIND OF HOUSING IS SUBJECT. TO THIS SIGNIFICANT- HURDLE- AND THAT IS HOUSING. THAT IS A PUBLICLY FUNDED. TO MAKE SURE THAT LOW INCOME PEOPLE HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS. AND THE ADDRESSES OF WHY WOULD WE SINGLE OUT ONLY THAT KIND OF HOUSING AND I THINK IT ANSWERS ITSELF. WAS DESIGNED TO PERPETUATE SEGREGATION BY INCOME BY CLASS OF CETERA THIS SHOULD NOT BE IN OUR CONSTITUTION IT IS A TERRIBLE SCARRING ON OUR CONSTITUTION AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S TIME TO GET RID OF IT- AND THERE IS AN AYE VOTE MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF S. C. R. A.

TO TAKE US FORWARD CHAU IN TURN WE COULD START BRINGING AFFORDABILITY INTO CALIFORNIA MORE HOUSING IS DEFINITELY DESPERATELY NEEDED SO I JOIN MY COLLEAGUES WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS AND EVERYONE WHO SUPPORTS THIS BILL AND I THINK IT IS THE RIGHT TIME RIGHT PLACE AND WE SHOULD BE PART OF IT AND LET'S MAKE HISTORY TOGETHER.

SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION SIXTY THREE BY SENATOR HER TADO RELATIVE TO ROSEANNE DO WHICH RECOGNITION DAY CENTER WHO TAUGHT OF THE FORGERS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT GOOD MORNING. I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT A C. R. SIXTY THREE RESOLUTION THAT RECOGNIZES JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTH AS ROSE AND WHICH DAY. THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS THE PLACE THAT IS NOT REALLY KNOWN AS BEING THE MOST PROGRESSIVE REGION IN THE STATE BUT IT IS IT IS HOME NOT ONLY TO THE YOUNGEST WOMAN LIKE TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE IS ALSO HOME TO THE FIRST WOMAN ELECTED. TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE. SENATOR BREACH WAS THE DAUGHTER OF SERBIAN IMMIGRANTS HAILING FROM THE SMALL TOWN OF DINUBA. HE SERVED SIXTEEN YEARS IN THE SENATE AND RETIRED IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO. DURING HER TIME CENTER WHICH SERVES NOT ONLY AS THE ONLY WOMAN FOR TWO YEARS. BUT SHE ALSO SERVED OF THE SENATE SPAM OF CONSCIENCE. HE REFUSE TO BE IGNORED. MANY OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH HER BOW SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THIS ONE HERE. BELLS ARE DIFFICULT TO FIND IN STORES THESE DAYS BUT I WAS FORTUNATE TO FIND THIS ONE. THIS BALLS FORWARD FROM THE FROM THE FAMILY MRS LINDA LEE SHARES RIGHT WELL. OF HANFORD BORN IN NINETEEN FORTY TWO I WANT TO READ WITH YOUR PERMISSION I'M PRESENT I LIKE TO BRING IT. PERMISSION GIVEN THANK YOU. IT IS SAID THAT WHENEVER HER COLLEAGUES ADDRESS THE GENTLEMAN OF THE SENATE SHE WOULD RING HER BELL TO REMIND THEM THAT THERE WAS A WOMAN PRESENT. IT IS BECAUSE OF HER THAT WE ALSO HAVE A WOMAN'S RESTROOM OFF OF THE SENATE FLOOR. THE ORIGINAL PLANS OF THE CAPITAL RICHER FOR DID NOT INCLUDE THE WOMEN'S RESTROOM. ONE WAS ADDED AFTER HER ELECTION. THE RUSSIAN MISSILE KNOWN AS THE ROSE. ROOM RULES AND WHICH WAS ALSO AN ADVOCATE FOR AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY. STORIES OF HER BRINGING IN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES TO THE SENATE FLOOR. ONLY TO WITHHOLD FROM HUNGRY COOPER UNTIL SHE WAS ABLE TO MAKE A POINT ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE ARE SOMEWHAT LEGENDARY. MANY OF US HERE IN THE SENATE WOULD NOT BE HERE HAD ROSE AND WHICH NOT BROKEN SO MANY BARRIERS AND LEAD THE WAY FOR WOMEN TO SERVE IN THE SENATE. THE BALLOT DIFFICULT REMINDER OF THE MANY STRUGGLES WOMEN FACE BUT ALSO AN INSPIRATION. TO CONTINUE SPEAKING EVEN WHEN YOU FEEL ON HER. BECAUSE OF THIS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE TO RECOGNIZE JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTH AS ROSE AND WHICH DAY THANK YOU PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING WITH ROSEANNE DOING. I CAME HERE FOUR YEARS AFTER SHE DID. SHE BLAMES THE TRAIL. AND WHO MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT A WOMAN. FROM A VERY SMALL SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY TOWN. WOULD BECOME THE FIRST WOMAN. TO BE IN THE S. STATE SENATOR IN CALIFORNIA. ROSEANNE DID COMMENDABLY. I WOULDN'T SAY SHE HAD ROUGH EDGES BUT SHE WAS FIRM IN HER CONVICTION. AND OUR PATIENTS AND ASSERTING HER MEMBERSHIP IN THIS HOUSE AS A FULL MEMBER. THE BILL THAT MY SAYING YOU'RE CALLING HERE. VERY TOOL TOWARDS THOSE AND A BIT OF MUSIC TO. AND ROSEANNE WAS FIERCE IN FIGHTING FOR WHAT SHE BELIEVED IN. I PREFER CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. WE TEAMED UP WHEN WE HAD THE MIDLIFE CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. AND ROSE AT AN IDEA THEY- THING THAT WAS KIND OF A WITH THE TIME. GOVERNOR BROWN WITH HIM MAKE UP HIS MIND WHETHER TO INITIATE AERIAL APPLICATION OF MALATHION DATE TO READ TO KEEP THIS. REGIS PASSED. SO WE THOUGHT LOWS IN IDA B. WELLS FOR US TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT IN ADVANCE. TO A CALL DOWN THERE SAID HE WAS TOO BUSY HARD HARD BENCHES WERE STILL THERE AT THE TIME. SENATORS DO YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT NO BUT WE'RE GOING TO STAY HERE UNTIL WE- GET TO SEE THE GOVERNOR. WHICH WE DID I THINK IT WAS ABOUT FORTY MINUTES. AND HE SUMMONED HIS SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE OVER AND ROSEANNE HE AND I. SAID ON THE FRANK DISCUSSION. ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE WAS WORTH BEING SAVED. ROSEANNE ALWAYS FOUGHT FOR THAT ALWAYS KNEW THAT IT DESERVES SAY. YOU STILL GET TO ENJOY THE ROSE ROOM HERE. THERE ARE SO MANY TRADITIONS WITH ROSE AND BROUGHT TO THIS HOUSE SO MUCH DIG. AND SHE SURELY WAS ONE- WOULD BE RESPECTED IN ANY COUNCIL. SMALL DINUBA OR THE LARGE CITIES THE REST OF THE STATE. I TAKE OVER OFF SPINNER BROTHER WILLIE. WHO IS YOUR CONSTANT COMPANION. HELPING HER. GET AROUND MOVE BACK AND FORTH FROM DINUBA. I WILL MEASURE I HAVE MISTER. BUT SHE HAS BROUGHT DIGNITY TO THE SENATE IN THIS WELL THAT WE SHOULD CONSTANTLY REMEMBER. SANTA ROSA AND WILL H. THE DINER. SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUES FOR PUTTING THIS FORWARD AND GIVING US THE ABILITY TO GIVE THE RECOGNITION TO OUR FIRST FEMALE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATOR ROSE AND WHICH AND- I WANTED TO- INDICATE THAT I'M VERY GLAD. THAT OR CALLING MADE THE POINTS ABOUT WHY OR- YOU KNOW WHY DO WE HAVE A BATHROOM NAMED AFTER THIS VERY IMPORTANT ONE BECAUSE WHEN SHE STARTED THERE WERE NO FEMALE RESTAURANTS. NOW WE KNOW THE BATHROOMS ARE CENTRAL AND WE AND THERE SHOULD NEVER BE A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THEM BUT I HOPE. THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE REDESIGN OF THIS BUILDING THAT WE THINK ABOUT ADDITIONAL WAYS TO HONOR IMPORTANT WOMEN IN THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE AS WE LOOK AROUND THIS BUILDING WE SEE THAT A NUMBER OF ROOMS. OTHER THAN BATHROOMS ARE NAMED AFTER PROMINENT MEN IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT NOT ANY OF OUR PROMINENT WOMEN'S SELF I SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION I'M GLAD IT'S BEING BROUGHT FORWARD BUT I THINK WE ALSO CAN DO BETTER AS WE RECOGNIZE AN HONOR IMPORTANT WOMEN. IN THE LEGISLATURE. FOR ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SAYING NINE SENATOR HURTADO YOU MAY CONCLUDE FOR AN AYE VOTE.

SENATE BILL THREE TWENTY FIVE BY SENATOR BRADFORD AN ACT RELATING TO CRIMINAL GANGS CENTER BRADFORD THE FLOOR'S YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE THAT SIMPLY ADDS AN ADDITIONAL MEMBER TO THE CAL DATABASE. AS A TECHNICAL THROUGH THE TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE. AS WELL NO THE GANG CAL GANG DATABASES MAINTAINED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE TO STORE THE NAMES OF OVER FORTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE SUSPECTED. OF BEING ACTIVE GANG MEMBERS ARE POSSIBLY ASSOCIATED WITH A GAME HOWEVER OUR RECENT AUDIT HAS FOUND THE DATABASE HAS A LOT ENACT. AND INADEQUATE- LOCK AND WITH OVERSIGHT THAT'S RESULTED IN A LOT OF UNRELIABLE AND POTENTIALLY VIOLATING. ONE'S PRIVACY RIGHTS- BASED ON THE STATE DATABASE THIS RESULTED IN QUESTIONABLE ENTRIES AND INCLUSION OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD NO GANG AFFILIATION INCLUDING CHILDREN SENIORS AND SADLY ALL TOO OFTEN AKRON AMERICANS AND LATINOS. I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT WE KNOW THERE ARE PLENTY HANGAL GANG MEMBERS WE'VE SEEN PLENTY OF THEM OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THIS RESULTED IN QUESTIONABLE ENTRIES AGAIN THE REVIEW- LET ME MOVE ON BUT THE GAME DATABASE ALLOWS FOR INDIVIDUAL TO REQUEST THE REMOVAL OF THE DATABASE AFTER RECEIVING NOTICE FROM LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. BETWEEN OCTOBER NINETEENTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FORTY REQUEST A REMOVAL WERE MADE AND ONLY TEN WERE GRANTED. UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS OFTEN CHOOSE NOT TO PURSUE THIS BECAUSE OF THE COSTLY- ME TOO COSTLY TIME CONSUMING THIS BILL WILL SIMPLY JUST ADD AN ATTORNEY WITH CONTESTING AND INDIVIDUALS DESIGNATION AS A GANG MEMBER TO THE KING- GAME DATABASE. AND IT'S ALSO INCLUDING- THIS REPRESENTATION WILL HELP ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATABASE AS WELL AS STRENGTHENED COMMUNITY TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROTECT INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES IRIS THE BEING INAPPROPRIATELY LABELED AS BEING AFFILIATED. THIS BILL SHOULD BE THE BEGINNING OF A LARGER CONVERSATION WE HAVE ABOUT THE CAL GATE DATABASE SYSTEM WHICH IS CURRENTLY ON FEAR AND AGAIN DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS BLACK AND BROWN INDIVIDUALS.

MEMBERS IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. THIRTY NIELSEN. MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THIS IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT THEY BE TOTALLY INVOLVED. I AM UNSYMPATHETIC AND I WILL VOTE NO TODAY. THE BILL MAY DEVELOP INTO A FORM THAT I COULD ACCEPT IN THE FUTURE. BUT I SUBMIT THIS IS RATHER ON TIME. GANGS RUN RAMPANT ACROSS AMERICA TODAY POURING ACROSS OUR BORDER. OUR COUNTRY. RAVAGING AND PILLAGING COMMUNITIES NOT ONLY IN THE LARGE TOWNS THE BIG CITIES. OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO THE TINY TOWN OF HAMILTON CITY. UP IN GLENN COUNTY WAS TAKEN OVER. BY A CRIMINAL GANG. A VERY SMALL. OKAY BUT A VERY SMALL CITY. IT IS A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER. WE BEST BE CAUTIOUS. FOR THAT PURPOSE I WILL VOTE NO. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SINGMAN SENATOR BRADFORD YOU MAY CONCLUDE. THANK YOU IN A PRESIDENT AND WE ALL SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT GANG ACTIVITY AS WE STATED WE'VE SEEN IT RUNNING RAMPANT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS WHAT WE SAW JANUARY SIX YOU CAN CLEARLY. CATEGORIZED AS DANCE BUT SURPRISINGLY NONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS FIND THEIR NAMES ON GAME DATABASES AGAIN WE SHOULD BE JUST AS CONCERNED OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO CONTINUE TO FIND THEIR NAMES ON GANG DATABASES WHEN IT'S A LOT LATER PROVED THEY'RE NOT GAINING MEMBERS THEY SIMPLY LIVED IN THE WRONG NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATED WITH THE WRONG INDIVIDUALS OR HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN. ASSOCIATED WITH GANGS THIS IS A SENSE MEASURE AND IT'S SIMPLY ADDS A TURN WHO HAS A WILL OF THE AND ABOUT IN. WHO ARE GAY CONTROL AND I WAS ASK YOUR I. GO. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

SENATE BILL SEVENTY BY SENATOR RUBIO AND AFTER RELATED TO KINDERGARTEN SENATOR RUBIO THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE TODAY I'M PROUD TO PRESENT SB SEVENTY AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THAT I'VE WORKED ON FOR THREE YEARS TO ENSURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT CHILDREN RECEIVE CRITICAL INSTRUCTION IN THE EARLIEST YEARS OF LEARNING SPECIFICALLY SB SEVENTY WILL REQUIRE STUDENTS TO COMPLETE ONE YEAR OF KINDERGARTEN PRIOR TO ENTERING THE FIRST GRADE OF A PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TO BE CLEAR- WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE COMPULSORY AGE. AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER I HAVE PERSONALLY WITNESSED HOW EARLY EDUCATION CAN HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON STUDENT ACADEMIC SUCCESS. YOU CAN EASILY DISTINGUISH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BILLS HAVE BEEN IN CANDOR AND THOSE THAT HAVE NOT. I HAVE BEEN IN A FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM WHEN I HAVE TO STUDENTS THAT ARE THE SAME AGE HOWEVER. ONE STRUGGLES TO SIT IN A CLASSROOM SETTING DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE PENCIL IS HOLDING THE BOOK UPSIDE DOWN BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER HAD THAT EXPERIENCE. WELL THE OTHER STUDENT IS ALREADY READING SECOND GRADE LEVEL THE WRITING FULL SENTENCES AND GOING EVEN FURTHER TALKING ABOUT ALL THE SCIENCE PROJECTS THAT WORKED ON DURING THE SUMMER. SO THAT DISPARITY ONLY GROWS EXPONENTIALLY AS THE CHILDREN GO UP IN GREAT LEVELS. NOW MORE THAN EVER WE MUST SUPPORT OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS BY ENSURING THAT THEY RECEIVE THOSE CRITICAL INSTRUCTION EARLY ON WHICH IS THE BUILDING BLOCKS FOR LATER YEARS. FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ENROLLED IN KINDERGARTEN OFTENTIMES IT'S THE TEACHERS AND THE PARENTS WHO ARE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME. TRYING TO TEACH THEM THE FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS THAT THEIR OTHER PEERS HAVE ALREADY MASTERED IN KINDERGARTEN. ADDITIONALLY OUR TEACHERS STRUGGLE NOW MORE THAN EVER US WE KNOW AND THE BEST WAY WE CAN SUPPORT THEM IS BY HAVING STUDENTS PREPARED. IN CLASS AND AS THEY MOVE UP IN ACADEMIC RATE LEVELS AGAIN AS A TEACHER I CAN ATTEST THAT WE- OFTEN HAVE THREE TO FOUR LEVELS GOING ON IN ONE CLASSROOM. AND HAVING TWO DIFFERENT DIFFERENTIATE AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY CHILD LEARNS IS A CHALLENGE WE DO IT WE DO IT GLADLY. BUT WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR TEACHERS STUDENTS CANNOT AFFORD THE GAP THAT INCREASES. EXPONENTIALLY AS I STATED AND THIS IS THE TIME ACROSS THE STATE WE HAVE SEEN LARGE DROPS IN SCHOOL ENROLLMENT. AND AS WE KNOW COVE IT HAS NOW MADE IT WORSE. LAST YEAR THE C. D. E. RELEASED DATA HIGHLIGHTING AN ENROLLMENT DROP. OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA'S K. TO TWELVE EDUCATION. AND IT'S ALSO BEEN REPORTED. THAT THERE IS A DROP IN KINDERGARTEN SPECIFICALLY OF SIXTY ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS AND THAT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT FOR EXAMPLE KINDERGARTEN ENROLLMENT FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE ACADEMIC SCHOOL YEAR FOR LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT DECLINED 14% THAT IS SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS AND IN LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS THIS DECLINE IS ABOUT THREE TIMES LARGER IN RECENT YEARS SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT ALSO. REPORTED DECLINE OF SEVENTEEN POINT 6% OAKLAND UNIFIED 9% DECLINE LONG BEACH UNIFIED 10% DECLINE AND IT GOES ON AND ON WE ARE LOSING OUR CHILDREN AT THE YOUNGER AGES WHERE THEY NEED IT THE MOST CLEARLY THESE UPCOMING SCHOOL YEARS ARE GOING TO BE VERY CHALLENGING NOT ONLY TO THE STUDENTS BUT FOR TEACHERS AS WELL AS THEY WERE SEE A LOT MORE. DIFFERENCE AMONG THEIR STUDENTS THE EDUCATIONAL GAP IS GOING TO BE LARGER WE NEED TO GIVE EVERY CHILD THAT OPPORTUNITY TO START OFF WITH AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD BEFORE I CLOSE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I ADDRESS THE EQUITY ISSUE THAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BROUGHT UP. THE STATE HAS INVESTED ADDITIONAL PROGRAMMING DOLLARS FOR CHILDREN BEFORE AND AFTER SCHOOL AND THOSE OPTIONS WILL STILL BE AVAILABLE I'M CURRENTLY WORKING ON ANOTHER COMPANION BILL TO ENSURE THAT WE TACKLE THAT ISSUE EVEN FURTHER I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE THERESOURCES THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL THANK YOU. MEMBERS WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT IT GETS DIFFICULT TO HEAR APPEAR WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS GOING ON SO IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION IF YOU COULD LEAVE THAT. THE CHAMBER SAID BE. UP MUCH APPRECIATED SENATOR BRIDGES. THANK YOU BETTER PRESENT IF I MAY POSE A QUESTION- THROUGH YOU TO THE AUTHOR. CENTER RUBIO YOU TAKE A QUESTION ABSOLUTELY. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED. A BILL LIKE THIS. A NUMBER OF YEARS BACK. AND FROM WHAT I READ WAS THAT. GOVERNOR BROWN SAID THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER SUPPLEMENTAL. FORMS OF EDUCATION. THAT CAN BRING THESE KIDS UP TO SPEED. NOW I'VE GOT TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BOYS. I THINK WHAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED DURING THIS CODE PROCESS ESPECIALLY. IS THAT. WE NEED KINDERGARTEN TO BE AN ESSENTIAL PART. OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL EXPERIENCE. BUT IF YOU FORCE PEOPLE IN. WHEN THEY'RE NOT HERE TO A CERTAIN GRADE LEVEL YOU HAVE A BIFURCATION OF THE CLASSROOM ITSELF RELEASED THE CLASS EXPERIENCE SOME KIDS ARE HAD SOME KEEP SOME KIDS ARE ON PAR AND SOME KIDS- ARE BEHIND. IT WHAT HAPPENS IS THE SCHOOL HAS NO CHOICE BUT ESSENTIALLY TO APPEAL TO THE INTERMEDIATE AND THE CHALLENGE ON SECTION OF THE CLASS FOR PURPOSES OF KEEPING THAT THE CLASSROOM FUNCTIONING AS A WHOLE. AND SO I SUPPORT ON WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE MY ONLY OUR QUESTION IS. TO YOU IS THEIR CHILD IS UP TO SPEED. AND MAYBE IS HOME SCHOOLED OR HAS RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATION COULD THE BY PASS KINDERGARTEN WINNER ELIGIBLE FOR FIRST GRADE ABSOLUTELY IN FACT THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT SPEAKS ABOUT HOME SCHOOLING IN PARTICULAR WHICH I KNEW WAS AN ISSUE THAT. OB PEOPLE BROUGHT UP SO I WORK WITH THE SCHOOL HOME SCHOOLING- ORGANIZATIONS TO ENSURE THAT WAS IN THE BILL THAT THAT IS AN OPTION IF PARENTS CHOOSE TO HOME SCHOOL THEM. THAT IS AN OPTION AND THAT IS ACCEPTABLE TO PROVE THAT THEY'VE ALREADY RECEIVED THAT ONE YEAR BEFORE COMING TO SCHOOL THEY CAN ALSO CHOOSE PRIVATE SCHOOLS NOT PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT'S ALSO AN OPTION. AND THERE'S ALSO DISCRETION AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH PARENTS IF THEY FEEL THAT THEIR CHILD IS UP TO PAR THEY CAN GET THEM TESTED AND ALONG WITH THE PAIN AND SCHOOL DISTRICT THEY CAN DECIDE. IF THEY MET THE CRITERIA TO JUST MOVE ON TO FIRST RATE THEY CAN DO SO AS WELL GOT INTO IT THIS IS A STANDARDIZED ARE TESTING- SITUATION WHERE PARENTS CAN ASK THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO PROVIDE A TEST AND THE TEST. IS THEN GIVEN TO THE CHILD CORRECT AND SO THAT'S LEFT TO THE DISCRETION OF THE DISTRICT AND THE PARENTS TOOK TO TEST THE CHILD IMPROVE THAT THEIR COMP OPINION C. LEVEL IS READY TO MOVE ON TO FIRST GRADE THANK YOU I THINK THE TIMES HAVE CERTAINLY CHANGED IN THE OLD DAYS. KINDERGARTEN AND EVEN PRE SCHOOL WORKING OBVIOUSLY LUXURIES THAT A LOT OF KIDS DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN.

THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I. KIND OF ADD IT IS A FINE. AND I THE ONLY I HAD A CONVERSATION. TO PRESENTING THE BELL ABOUT. CANDOR BEING MOSTLY I'VE YOU KNOW CRAFT SIMPLY TIME AND I JUST WANNA. MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE TIMES HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY SINCE WE WERE IN SCHOOL. WE WENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE STANDARDS THAT WERE A LITTLE BIT. MY OPINION MORE LENIENT TO NOW COMMON CORE. AND SO IT'S NO LONGER JUST PLAYTIME ARE KISSING CANDOR ARE LEARNING HOW TO WRITE. FULL SENTENCES LEARNING THE NUMBERS. LEARNING A LOT OF- ACADEMIC LANGUAGE THAT IS NECESSARY TO THE BUILDING BLOCKS. TO BEING READY FOR FIRST GRADE AND FIRST GRADE.

THANK YOU MANAGER- I WANT TO APPLAUD THE AUTHOR I THINK THAT ALL THE ISSUES THAT SHE HAS RAISED I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH AND I THINK A AND I SUPPORT THE BILL MOVING FORWARD OF THE AUTHOR AND I HAVE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS BUT I JUST WANT TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THE ISSUES WHICH I WILL I DON'T EXPECT AN ANSWER RIGHT NOW. BUT I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE'S A BY ADDING THE NEW GRADE THERE'S A BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S AN IMPACT ON OUR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SYSTEM SO YOU KNOW AN IMPACT ON THE ENROLLMENT AND FUNDING PRESCHOOL AND CHILDCARE PROGRAMS ON IN HOME PROVIDERS AND FAMILY PROVIDERS- IMPACT ON FAMILIES WHO RELY ON NON SCHOOL CARE SETTINGS WITH NONTRADITIONAL HOURS. OF THESE ARE HALF DAY PROGRAMS NOT ALL FAMILIES CAN TRANSPORT CHILDREN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORK DAY- AND THEN THE IMPACT ON. I'M FEDERAL OF FUNDING OF FOR EXAMPLE ON HEAD START PROGRAMS- AND THE SHIP THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO TO SERVING A LARGER. POPULATION OF ZERO THREE THREE YEAR OLDS- MY DISTRICT WE HAVE SIX HEAD START GRANTEES. ARE SERVING OVER FOUR THOUSAND ARE CHILDREN SO THESE ARE JUST ISSUES THAT- I WILL PASS ON TO THE TO THE AUTHOR.

MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ THE BILL TO EIGHTY SIX BY SENATOR MEN AND AFTER LEADING TO ELECTIONS CENTERMAN THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS SORRY FOR JUMPING THE GUN HAS BEEN A FEW WEEKS- I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SB TWO EIGHTY SIX WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE LECTIONS FOR THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION BE CONSOLIDATED WITH STATEWIDE GENERAL ELECTION IN NOVEMBER INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT PRACTICE WHICH IS TO HOLD IT DURING THEPRIMARY ELECTION. THIS BILL IS BASED ON A VERY SIMPLE PROPOSITION THAT COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION SERVE CRITICAL FUNCTIONS IN OUR STATE AND THEREFORE IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO GET MORE VOTERS INVOLVED IN GAUGED INFORMED ABOUT THESE CRITICAL LOCAL GOVERNING BOARDS I'VE TALKED TO TOO MANY CONSTITUENTS IN MY DISTRICT HAVE BEEN CONFUSED BY THE PRACTICE- THAT WE HAVE NOW WITH ORANGE COUNTY BOARD EDUCATION IS ELECTED I SIMPLY ONE AND DONE IN THE PRIMARY WE'RE ONE OF ONLY FIVE COUNTIES IN THE STATE THAT DOES THAT. AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A FAR LOWER TURN OUT IN TWENTY TWENTY THE PRIMARY HAD ROUGHLY HALF THE VOTERS AT THE GENERAL ELECTION I AND I AGAIN MANY VOTERS TO COME UP TO ME AND SAID THAT THEY FEEL FRUSTRATED THAT THEY DON'T GET TO VOTE FOR THEIR BOARD OF EDUCATION TRUSTEES OUT OF THE FORTY TWO COUNTIES THAT HAVE CANDIDATE ELECTIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY FOR BOARD EDUCATION. ALL BUT FIVE OF THEM FORTY TWO HAD THEM IN THE GENERAL ELECTION I NEED TURNOUT DIFFERENTIALS THAT RESULTS ARE PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED AMONG RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES YOUNG PEOPLE AND LOW PROPENSITY VOTERS BRED BRINGING THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE REST OF THE STATE SB TWO EIGHTY SIX WOULD INCREASE VOTER PARTICIPATION REDUCE VOTER CONFUSION I THINK AB POSITIVE EXTERNALITIES BY CREATING UNIFORMITY AROUND THE TIMING ALEXION'S. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. SENATOR NEWMAN. I THANK YOU PRESIDENT THAT IRA IN SUPPORT OF TWO EIGHTY SIX- AS THE SENATOR FROM ORANGE COUNTY HAS NOTED THE COUNTY BOARD OF ELECTIONS WITH A FEW OFFICES IN ORANGE COUNTY. WHICH ELECTIONS ARE WHOLLY DECIDED ON THE DATE OF A STATEWIDE PRIMARY- IN ORANGE COUNTY ACROSS THE STATE MOST IMPORTANT LIKE TO OFFICES ARE SELECTED IN TWO STAGES WITH THE INITIAL VOTE HELD IN THE PRIMARY ELECTION. AND A RUN OFF VOTE TO ACHIEVE A MAJORITY RESULT IN THE GENERAL. COURT OF THE ARCHAIC ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER OF VOTERS BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY TWENTY AN AVERAGE OF 83% MORE ORANGE COUNTY VOTERS CAST BALLOTS STATEWIDE GENERAL ELECTIONS THAN IT STATEWIDE PRIMARY ELECTIONS BECAUSE OF HOW THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATIONALIST IS HELD ON THE PRIMARY DATE THERE ARE POTENTIALLY THOUSANDS OF VOTERS WHO DO NOT CAST A BALLOT. IN A WINNING CANDIDATE CAN PREVAIL WITH WITH NOT ONLY A VERY SMALL AGGREGATE VOTE TOTAL- BUT ALSO A TOTAL THAT FILES BEFORE FAR SHORT OF A MAJORITY. OF THE DIFFERENCE IN TURNOUT IS PICKING THOSE WHO AMONG RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES IMMIGRANTS AND YOUNG PEOPLE- AND IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT THESE ARE EXACTLY THE PEOPLE MOST AFFECTED BY THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT IS ELECTIONS ARE INTENDED TO DO MORE ORANGE COUNTY RESIDENTS WILL HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD. AND ULTIMATELY THEIR INTERESTS REPRESENTED AS THE VOTE FOR IMPORTANT ELECTIVE OFFICE THAT IS INCREASINGLY DRAWN PUBLIC SCRUTINY IN RECENT YEARS THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY SHOULD TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY. TO INCREASE SPECIFIC PARTICIPATION IN ELECTIONS LARGE OR SMALL I COMMEND MY COLLEAGUE FROM PROVIDE FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THIS MORNING. SENATOR A TROUBLE. THANK YOU MADAM I DO HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO- MY COLLEAGUE AT THROUGH THE PRESIDENT I MAY CENTER MEN YES OKAY QUESTION. THANK YOU I'M THINKING MAYBE WE HAD A QUESTION- AND I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT BUT- AS AS I STATED IN THE COMMITTEE IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S ALREADY IN STATUTE. I'M HAVING THE ABILITY FOR THE LOCAL COUNTY. BOARD OF EDUCATION TO CHOOSE TO CHANGE THE DATE OF THE ELECTION. AND BEING THAT IT'S ALREADY SUCH A HAD ASKED WHETHER OR NOT IT HAD ALREADY BRING BY THAT BROUGHT UP TO. THE TO THE BOARD BY THEIR OWN CONSTITUENTS TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS A CONCERN AND THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT- IT COULD BE CHANGED SO I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAD FOLLOWED UP ON THAT AND WHETHER OR NOT IT HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP TO THE BOARD FOR LOCAL DECISION MAKING. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I APPRECIATE THAT SENATOR AND I'D SAY WE DID FOLLOW UP WE WERE NOT ABLE TO DRILL DOWN AND A 100% CERTAIN ANSWER WHICH IS WHY WE DIDN'T RESPOND- YET BUT- WHAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S NOT BEEN A FORMAL PROPOSAL MADE TO THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF CONSTITUENTS AND OTHERS WHO HAVE BROUGHT THIS UP TO MEMBERS INDIVIDUALLY ABOUT THE DIP IDEA OF MOVING THIS ELECTION TO. NOVEMBER SO IT IS SHORT ANSWERS I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S BEEN A FORMAL PROPOSAL MADE BUT THERE HAVE BEEN INFORMAL ENQUIRIES. I DO HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION MADAM PRESIDENT YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU. SO IN OTHER WORDS WE HAVING GIVEN. IN STATUTE IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT YES AND THAT BEING SAID I THINK THE GENERAL TENOR IN BELIEF BY MANY CONSTITUENTS IS THAT THIS. PARTICULAR BOARD OF EDUCATION I IS VERY PARTISAN AND IS UNLIKELY TO MOVE THAT I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY REFLECTED IN SOME OF THE PUBLIC COMMENTS THAT THEY'VE ALREADY MADE ABOUT THIS BILL. NONE OF WHICH HAVE SUBSTANCE LIAM SUBSTANTIVELY ADDRESS THAT THE IDEA OF MOVING ELECTION FROM THE PRIMARY TO THE NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTION- BUT WHICH HAVE REALLY ENGAGE IN A LOT OF VITRIOLIC STATEMENTS IN. INCLUDING SOME ONES THAT ARE PERSONAL OFFENSIVE IN AND SO I THINK THE SENSE IS THAT THIS PARTICULAR MAKE UP OF THIS BOARD. IS NOT LIKELY TO MOVE IT. OKAY SO MY COMMENTS COMING FROM A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE AS FAR AS GOVERNMENT GOES I ALWAYS FEEL THAT THE CONSTITUENTS HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO POWER TO CHANGE THE LOCAL BOARD IF THEY'RE NOT HAPPY WITH THE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE IN THAT DIRECTION SO- I AM VERY HESITANT TO BRING THIS TO THE STATE LEVEL TO INTRUDE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHEN THEY HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS IT LOCALLY SO I RESPECTFULLY WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. SENATOR BRIDGES. I THINK MY COLLEAGUES- JUST SAID I THINK SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS. IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO THINK THAT THIS IS A DISTRICT FILL. THISIS NOT A DISTRICT BILL. THIS IS A BILL THAT IS SEEKING TO TAKE THE STRONG ARM OF THE STATE. N. R. ORCHESTRATE- IN OUTCOME AT A LOCAL LEVEL. I KNOW A LOT OF YOU ARE IN THIS ROOM BELIEVE IN LOCAL AUTHORITY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE WHERE LOCAL AUTHORITIES SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES. WHETHER A PRIMARY SHOULD BE IN A- IN A- IN JUNE OR THERE MIGHT BE A GENERAL IN WHATEVER FORMAT THAT THEY SEE FIT. AND I THINK HEARING THE MOTIVATION BEHIND THIS- WAS EVEN MORE DISTURBING THAT THE PARTISAN NATURE OF THE BOARD WOULD DISALLOW THIS SO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE AT THE STATE. IS THAT THE NATURE OF OUR FORM OF GOVERNMENT. THAT THE DETERMINATIVE BODY IF THEY DECIDE TO DO SOMETHING OR NOT DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE DECIDED THERE IN THAT ENDS IN THAT IS THE ISSUE. THIS IS TERRIBLY DANGEROUS FOR US TO LOOK UPON THIS AS A DISTRICT BILL BECAUSE IT IS USING THE STATE RESURFACED THE STRONG ARM OF THE STATE TO COME IN AND TELL THEM THAT IF YOU DON'T DO WHAT WE WANT YOU TO DO THAT WE WILL CHANGE THE RULES. IN MORE INTELLECTUALLY ON BROOCH WHAT FOR TO BE A COMPLETE STATEWIDE PROCESS WHERE PRIMARIES IN GENERAL ARE DETERMINED ACROSS THE STATE BUT I HEARD THERE WAS A LEASE FIVE JURISDICTIONS THEY DON'T DO IT IN THAT FASHION. I WOULD ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUE AND I HAVE THE HIGHEST RESPECT FOR HIM BETTER SUITED NOT IN ADDITION BILL FORMAT BUT AS A MATTER OF STATE POLICY AND THEN WE CAN DEBATE ON THE MERITS IN THAT FASHION. SENATOR UMBERG. I JOIN MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUES FROM FULLERTON AND IRVINE IN SUPPORTING S. B. AT TWO EIGHTY SIX I TAKE THE POINT- THAT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO REYES BUT IT IS A STATE WIDE INTEREST I THINK TO MAKE SURE THAT ELECTIONS HAVE THE GREATEST PARTICIPATION AS IS POSSIBLE THIS IS A UNIQUE COLLECTION IT'S A PLURALITY VOTE AND IT SHOULD BE DONE- WITH THE LARGEST CONSTITUENCY THE LARGEST ELECTORATE AS IS POSSIBLE NUMBER I URGE. SENATOR NEWMAN. AT THANK YOU MEASURE DUBBED AS SOMEBODY WHO SPOKE IN SUPPORT OF THAT I'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO JUST TO BE VERY CLEAR- MY INTEREST AND I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR OTHERS- AND FOR THOSE WHO VOTED COMMITTEE IT THERE THERE'S NO PARTISAN ANIMUS TO THIS VOTE- THE QUESTION HERE IS WHETHER OR NOT THE ELECTION FOR A VERY IMPORTANT OFFICE FOR COUNTY WIDE EDUCATION OFFICE. SHOULD THE RESULT SHOULD BE AS REPRESENTATIVE AS POSSIBLE- HOW WHATEVER FORM THAT TAKES BY WAY OF PARTISAN RESULT IS IMMATERIAL TO ME IT'S THIS IS A MATTER OF EQUITY NOW THIS IS A MATTER PARTICIPATION- AND ENSURING THAT THE VOICES OF THOSE MOST AFFECTED ARE HEARD- AND I KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUE LEVINE WILL POINT THIS OUT- HIS INITIAL INTENT WAS WAS ACTUALLY TO MAKE THIS A STATEWIDE BILL- AND THERE WERE MANY WHO SUPPORTED THAT THE DECISION WAS MADE AS IT MOVED THROUGH COMMITTEE. THAT TO LIMIT THIS TO ORANGE COUNTY FOR NOW- THAT'S THE BASIS OF OUR VOTE TODAY- AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT IS NECESSARY IMPORTANT PRECISELY BECAUSE THE MEMBERSHIP OF THIS BOARD IS THE LEAST INCLINED TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF CHANGING LOCAL- AND THAT UNFORTUNATELY IS WHY NOW WE FEEL THE NEED TO DO THAT HERE. IN SACRAMENTO TODAY THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DOES OR TO BE. SENATOR- CHIU. SO I'M RESPONSE TO MY COLLEAGUES I DON'T THINK THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT WE BELIEVE THAT- IT'S TO THE INTENT TO HAVE THE GREATEST TURNOUT FOR VOTERS I THINK THE QUESTION HERE REMAINS AT LEAST FOR ME PERSONALLY. THE FACT THAT IT'S ALREADY IN STATUTE THAT THESE ELECTIONS CAN BE CHANGED- AND IT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED LOCALLY WHICH HAS NOT BEING GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ADDRESSED COOLEY TO CHANGE THAT. WHETHER OR NOT THE MAKE UP HEATERS TO THAT TO THAT CHANGE I THINK SHOULD BE DECIDED BY THE LOCAL RESIDENTS AND LOCAL CONSTITUENTS WHO VOTE IN THOSE BOARD MEMBERS SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS THAT. IF WE SUPERSEDE THE LOCAL CONSTITUENTS WERE SAYING THAT THE STATE IS TELLING THE LOCAL PEOPLE. HOW THEY SHOULD GO WHAT THEY SHOULD DO AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY A FAIR- AND QUITE FRANKLY- SERVICE PLEASE. RIGHT WORD FAT. WE ARE OVERSTEPPING ON LOCAL VOTING CONSTITUENTS AND WHAT THEY WANT IF THEY DON'T DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR LOCAL BOARD LOCAL CONSTITUENTS HAVE THE AUTHORITY HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE THAT PORT AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS BECAUSE WE DON'T AGREE WITH THAT BOARD THAT THE STATE HAS THE POWER TO COME OVER AND SAY OKAY THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO. SO I THINK FOR ME THE BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT WE SHOULD ALLOW THE LOCAL CONSTITUENTS TO CHOOSE THE BOARD THAT THEY WISH AND HAVE THE BOARD THEN DIRECT AT WENDY'S ELECTIONS ARE ADDRESSED THE ISSUE THERE LOCALLY I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST CONCERN FOR ME. YOUR ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER MENU MAKE INCLUDE YES IF I COULD RESPOND TO A FEW MIKE- COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR SO I THINK MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES FROM ORANGE COUNTY FOR SUPPORTING THIS BILL I IN RESPONSE MY COLLEAGUES FROM YUCAIPA IN FRESNO I WOULD I WOULD JUST SAY THIS THE ORIGINS OF THIS BILL WERE BASED ON THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD HAVE MAXIMUM TURNOUT. AND IN RESPONSE THE IDEA THAT THIS IS A LOCAL MATTER I'LL JUST POINT OUT THAT THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THIS ELECTION DATE HAS EXISTED FOR SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS AND NOTHING HAS HAPPENED AND THIS BILL IS NOT PARTISAN IN NATURE AS AS MY COLLEAGUE IMPORTANT POINTED OUT I TRY TO APPLY THIS INITIALLY TO ALL COUNTY WIDE ELECTIONS ACROSS THE STATE. UNFORTUNATE THAT BILL DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH SUPPORT TO GET OUT OF COMMITTEES- SO I NEVER TO ORANGE COUNTY AND TO THE ONE BODY THAT HAS ELECTIONS WE DECIDED IN A PRIMER THERE'S NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT BODY OUT THERE THAT DOES THIS OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ARE SHERIFFS ALL HAVE A TOP TWO THAT ADVANCES OUT IF SOME UNLESS SOMEONE GETS 50% THE PRIMARY. ARE STATE LEGISLATIVE OFFICES IN OUR FEDERAL OFFICES COURSE HEAVY TOP TO THE DANCE IS THE GENERAL ELECTION INTO YOUR THE TWO MIGHT THE POINT MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM YUCAIPA ABOUT ALLOWING LOCAL CONSTITUENTS TO DECIDE THIS LOCALLY THAT'S PRECISELY THE POINT OF THIS BILL I'VE TALKED TO TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY GET TO VOTE FOR BOARD OF EDUCATION SIMPLY DON'T PARTICIPATE GENERALLY IN PRIMARIES. MOST PEOPLE OUT THERE BELIEVE IT WITH SAWDUST EDUCATION THE PRIMARIES ARE MEANT TO DECIDE YOUR CHOICES FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION AND SO THEY JUST GENERAL ELECTION TO DECIDE THE BOOK BETWEEN THOSE TOP TWO THEY NEVER GET THAT CHANCE AND NEVER GET THE CHANCE TO CHANGE THE MAKE UP OF THAT BOARD AND SO THIS BILL IS BASED ON THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD GET RID OF THAT CONFUSION. WE SHOULD MAXIMIZE TURN OUT. IN POWER AT THE TYPES OF VOTERS IN MY COLLEAGUES IN FULLERTON I BOTH MENTIONED YEAH PEOPLE IN THE- PEOPLE LET. BURGER GO TO SCHOOL OR FOR SOME OTHER REASON AND EMPOWER THEM TO. THEIR ALSO THAT WE GET A CALL. WE BACK. CLARITY AND WE GET. TURNOUT FOR BY THIS. VERY IN.

SENATOR WIENER HE IS PREPARED PLEASE READ SENATE BILL TWO SIXTY BY SENATOR WIENER AN ACT RELATING TO GREENHOUSE GASES CENTER WIENER THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PRESIDENT BY COLLEAGUES SENATE BILL TWO SIXTY THE CLIMATE CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY ACT WILL REQUIRE ALL US BASED COMPANIES WITH OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL REVENUE AND WHO DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA- TO REPORT THEIR FULL CARBON FOOTPRINT- TO THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND SECRETARY OF STATE. AFTER THIS DISCLOSURE- CAR WILL BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REPORT ON THESE ENTITIES- WORKING WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE- THIS REPORT WILL INCLUDE A ROAD MAP- ADVISORY FOR THESE CORPORATIONS ABOUT HOW TO LOWER THEIR CARBON EMISSIONS. IN ORDER- TO KEEP US ON TRACK TO PUT US ON TRACK. TO MEET THE MAXIMUM WARMING LEVELS THAT WE KNOW ARE WE NEED TO COMPLY WITH A TO BELOW ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS- THIS REPORT WILL ALSO INCLUDE REASONABLE ESTIMATES- TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE CALLS ARE PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED. SB TWO SIXTY OF THE NECESSARY IN BOLD STEP FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT WE NOT ONLY HIT OUR CURRENT CLIMATE GOALS BUT HOW THE NECESSARY DATA AND INFORMATION- TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE TACKLING THIS EXISTENTIAL CRISIS. FOR OUR PLANET YOU CAN'T. REGULATE WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW CONSUMERS CAN MAKE DECISIONS. WITHIN ON INFORMATION INVESTORS CAN MAKE DECISIONS AND WE NEED THE STATE OF. EARLY CALLING THERE ARE COURT. THAT ARE COMPILING THIS DATA SOME OF THEM DISCLOSE THAT DATA. SOME OF THEM DON'T. SOME OF THEM ONLY DISCLOSE PARTIAL DATA AND EXCLUDE SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS THERE IS NO CONSISTENCY HERE. I AM THIS BILL WILL BRING CONSISTENCY AND USE WELL ESTABLISHED METHODOLOGIES TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL LARGE CORPORATIONS DOING BUSINESS IN OUR STATE. ARE DISCLOSING IN A STANDARDIZED WAY AND THE CONSUMERS AND GOVERNMENT AND INVESTORS AND THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION RIGHT NOW COMPANIES ARE EASILY ABLE TO GREEN WASH% WHAT IS I MEAN. THEY PUT OUT INFORMATION ABOUT HOW GREEN THEY ARE. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING THEY'RE NOT GREEN WE JUST LEARNED THIS RECENTLY WITH CELL. A MAJOR CORPORATION WHICH HAS A CARBON CAPTURE PROGRAM IN CANADA THAT IS LITERALLY EMITTING MORE CARBON THAN IT'S CAPTURING. WE-SHOULD HAVE THAT DATA FOR ALL CORPORATIONS SO THAT WE HAVE- ACCOUNTABILITY. I'M COLLEAGUES I KNOW THIS BILL HAS THERE'S A LOT OF OPINIONS ABOUT THIS BUT WE HAVE A HUGE COALITION SUPPORTING. THE BILL AND I KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS RAISED BY ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING WORKERS REPRESENTING BUSINESSES. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR THE LAST YEAR I'M ON THIS BILLWITH THOSE WHO HAVE RAISED CONCERNS AND WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS BASED ON THOSE CONVERSATIONS. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND I WILL BE CONTINUING TO MEET WITH AND WORK WITH. ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE RAISED CONCERNS ON IF THIS GETS OUT OF THE SENATE WILL DO THAT WORK IN THE ASSEMBLY WILL CONTINUE THAT WORK- AND COLLEAGUES- I ALSO KNOW THERE'S CONTINUING WORK. ABOUT THE EXACT THE MINISTRATION IN TERMS OF WHAT AGENCY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT WE MADE RECENT AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS SOME CONCERNS. THAT WILL BE- CONTINUING WORK- IN THE ASSEMBLY IF THE BILL GETS TO THE ASSEMBLY ASA COLLEAGUES THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CLIMATE ACTION BILL. HI INFORMATION AND DATA ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. SENATOR PENN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO SIXTY- IS IT A PERFECT BILL NOW I HAVE SOME ISSUES- AND I APPRECIATE MY CONVERSATIONS WITH MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SAN FRANCISCO. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS A CRISIS. AND EVEN THOSE WERE STRUGGLING OF COVETED WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE CLOCK IS TICKING ON CLIMATE. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE GOOD DATA THAT WE HAVE REPORTING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON. NOW I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT- ONE OF MY MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL ORIGINALLY. AND IS THAT- I WANT TO BE SURE THAT- SMALL BUSINESSES PARTICULARLY MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES IMMIGRANT BUSINESSES. ARE NOT REMOVED FROM BEING ABLE TO. HAVE CONTRACTS TO BE PART OF SUPPLY CHAIN FOR THESE LARGE CORPORATIONS WE DON'T WANT TO DENY- ENTREPRENEURS TYPICALLY IMMIGRANTS AND- ENTREPRENEURS OF COLOR FROM BE ABLE TO ENGAGE BECAUSE OF ONEROUS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHOR- TOOK AMENDMENTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR CONCERN. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S INTERESTING ENOUGH CONCERNS ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF THE DATA I HOPE THAT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY HAVE OPPOSITION TO THE FACT THAT I ACTUALLY WANT TO ALLOW THESE BUSINESSES TO BE ABLE TO DO ESTIMATES SO THAT WE DON'T OVERBURDEN REPORTING. SO I KNOW THEY'RE SOMETIMES THERE'S CONFLICTING THINGS BUT- IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GIVE IN MY OPINION THAT- WE GIVE THE AUTHOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. SO THAT WE HAVE THE INFORMATION WE NEED. MAKE POLICY. TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS I WILL ALSO POINT OUT AS WELL. I KNOW THIS ONE FAMILY DEALS WITH BILLION DOLLAR PLUS CORPORATIONS. THAT I'VE ACTUALLY CALLED ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS CERTAINLY A LARGE EMPLOYER THE LARGEST IMPACT IN MY DISTRICT. TO ALSO PERHAPS DO THE SAME IN TERMS OF TRYING TO ESTABLISH CLIMATE YOU KNOW- FOOT. PLANET FOOTPRINT FOR A GREENHOUSE THE PRINGLES. AND TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REDUCE THAT WORKING. WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE- COMPANY OR THE ORGANIZATION ITSELF IT'S ABOUT HOW THEY DO BUSINESS. WITH OTHER ENTITIES AS WELL AND HOW IT AND IN TERMS OF PRIORITIZING THIS. SO I THINK THIS IS A WERE THE BILL TO MOVE FORWARD- IT'S AN IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE I THINK THE AUTHORS ARE READY- DRESSED MANY ISSUES HERE IN THE SENATE AND DESERVE THE OPPORTUNITY CONTINUE TO DO THAT IN THE ASSEMBLY. I KNOW THAT AND- SO I THINK. WE NEED TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION WE NEED TO HAVE THAT. INFORMATION AT THIS BILL CALLS FOR. AND I'M SET UP FINANCED THAT MY GOOD FROM FROM ST STE MY GOOD FRIENDS IN SAN FRANCISCO. WILL CONTINUE THAT WORK AND COME BACK TO US WHEN HE COMES BACK IN CONCURRENCE. WITH AN EXCELLENT BUILD ALL HELP US ADDRESS THE CRISIS. THEREFORE I URGE AN AYE VOTE ON. SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MADAM RAISES A PROUD JOIN AUTHOR OF THIS LEGISLATION AND I WOULD SUBMIT COLLEAGUES THAT THIS IS BOTH- PRO BUSINESS AND PRO LABOR PIECE OF LEGISLATION- WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CORPORATIONS A BILLION DOLLARS OR GREATER AS THIS BILL COVERS. AND THOSE CORPORATIONS ARE MAKING ASSERTIONS ABOUT BEING NET ZERO OR CARBON NEUTRAL AS IS BECOMING A GROWING TREND. YOU SEE AMAZON OUT THERE DOING IT. YOU SEEN EXXON MOBIL ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK- NET ZERO COMMITMENT. BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THEY SAY IT- THAT THE MATH BEHIND IT IS SOMETHING THAT'STRANSPARENT AND ACCURATE FOR PEOPLE TO HANG OUR HATS ON- I THINK DOING HONEST MATH. WILL ACTUALLY HELP CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES THAT WILL HELP CALIFORNIA LABOR ORGANIZATIONS. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE SMALL BUSINESSES OUT THERE OR THE FOLKS STRUGGLING ALONG THE SUPPLY CHAIN. WITH THESE GLOBAL CORPORATIONS THE INCENTIVE WILL BE TO BRING BUSINESS BACK TO CALIFORNIA TO DO THAT WORK. IF YOU WANT TO LOWER YOUR CARBON FOOTPRINT THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS RELY ON LOCAL LABOR. AND LOCAL SUPPLIES WHETHER YOU'RE MAKING A HAMBURGER OR SHIPPING SOMEONE A NEW PAIR OF JEANS AND I THINK THE INCENTIVE TO HAVE THAT MAPPED OUT THERE WITHOUT ANY REGULATORY COMPLIANCE OBLIGATION LET'S BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT A NEW REGULATORY REGIME THIS IS NOT A NEW ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL THIS IS JUST ABOUT STANDARDIZING THE MATH. AND SO WHEN EXXON MOBIL GOES OUT AND SAYS THEIR NET ZERO BUT THEY SAY OH BUT WE DIDN'T INCLUDE ANY OF THE EMISSIONS FROM COMBUSTION ALL OF OUR GASOLINE ALL OVER THE WORLD. BUT WE'RE NOT ZERO. IS THAT REALLY FAIR. SO I WOULD I WOULD SUBMIT- THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA THAT THIS IS NOT SUPERFLUOUS DATA AND THAT WHEN PEOPLE SAY SOMETHING- THEY HAVE TO MEET IT. AND ESPECIALLY CORPORATIONS IF WE'RE GOING TO TREAT THEM LIKE OTHER PEOPLE THEY HAVE TO MEAN IT TOO. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. CENTER GROVE. AT CENTER GROVE NOPE CENTER JOHNSON. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT BRIEFLY YOU KNOW THAT ON THIS FOR AND ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF ANECDOTAL AND SCIENTIFIC DEBATE ON. GLOBAL WARMING GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE SEA LEVEL RISE. BUSINESS REGULATION AND THE IMPACTS OF A POLICIES ON BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. BUT ONE THING THAT'S NOT OUR TO THINGS THAT AREN'T ADDING ANECDOTAL THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE NEWS RECENTLY AND THAT WERE ALL EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW IS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA. WE'VE LOST A CONGRESSIONAL SEAT THAT'S NOT ANECDOTAL. WHAT CAUSES A STATE TO LOSE A CONGRESSIONAL SEAT IS WHEN PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT STATE. AND WE BET BEGAN SEEING THIS IN THE EIGHTIES WITH WHAT NOW IS CALLED THE RUST BELT STATES. WHEN THEY BEGIN LOSING CONGRESSIONAL SEATS THEY STILL HAVE NOT RECOVERED. FROM THOSE LOSSES IN SOME OF THOSE STATES EVEN CONTINUE TO LOSE CONGRESSIONAL SEATS. THIS YEAR. N. AS STATES LOSE CONGRESSIONAL SEATS THEY LOSE POLITICAL INFLUENCE AND POWER IN WASHINGTON DC. AND I WOULD HATE TO SEE OUR STATE MOVE CONTINUOUSLY IN THAT DIRECTION. THE SECOND THING IS NOT ANECDOTAL I WAS THE HEADLINE LAST WEEK IS THE MOVING COMPANY YOU HALL ACTUALLY RAN OUT OF VEHICLES. PEOPLE MOVING OUT OF CALIFORNIA. THAT IS AN UNBELIEVABLE STATISTIC AND STATEMENT OF FACT THAT ONE OF THE LARGEST MOVING COMPANIES IN THE COUNTRY ACTUALLY RAN OUT OF VEHICLES FOR PEOPLE LEAVING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HELLO WE CAN HAVE A DEBATE ON GLOBAL WARMING AND ITS IMPACTS ON BUSINESSES AND I THINK WE'VE HAD SEVERAL OF THOSE ROBUST DEBATE. BUT WHEN WE GET DOWN THE BOTTOM LINE OF POLICIES SUCH AS THIS ONE. WE HAVE TO ANALYZE. IS THIS COMPOUNDING THE PROBLEM. OF COMPANIES TRYING TO DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE TALK ABOUT BILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES YOU KNOW ONE OF THE IMAGES WERE TRYING TO PRO TRAIN THAT IS BILLIONAIRES AND MILLIONAIRES. BUT ONE OF THE IMPACTS THAT WE FORGET IT IS IT'S ACTUALLY MIDDLE CLASS AND MORTGAGE PLAYING PAYING CALIFORNIANS THAT WORK FOR THESE BILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES. AND JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY DOESN'T MEAN THEY MAKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROFIT. MEANS THEY HAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN REVENUE AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN EXPENSES OF LABOR. AND PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING IN CALIFORNIA WORKING IN CALIFORNIA WANT TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA AND WANT TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK AS WE PROVIDE PROGRESS OVER THIS COMING YEAR IT WOULD BE REALLY WISE OF US. TO LOOK AT POLICIES SUCH AS THIS. AND I ACKNOWLEDGE THE AUTHOR AS BEING COMMITTED TO. SOLVING THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THIS PARTICULAR POLICY I THINK DOES NOT DO THAT BUT DOES COMPOUND THE PROBLEM y AT CALIFORNIA AS A PLACE TO DO BUSINESS. COMPANIES THERE IN CALIFORNIA WANTING TO STAY IN BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA AND ANALYZING POLICIES LIKE THIS AND HAVING TO MAKE AN ECONOMIC DECISION ON WHETHER TO STAY OR NOT. I WOULD SUGGEST MEMBERS TODAY THAT WE WOULD PASS ON THIS BILL AND- THANK YOU VERY MUCH I URGE A NO VOTE. SENATOR NEWMAN. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE AS ONE WHO SOMETIMES BEEN CAUGHT IN BETWEEN- WITH SINCE THE RESERVATIONS AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTEE TALK TO ABOUT THE CUT THE CUT ADDITIONAL COST INCURRED BY BUSINESS BUT ALSO THE PERSPECTIVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF LEGISLATION SUCH AS THIS. I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS MEASURE TODAY I'D LIKE TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH MY COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO I CLEARLY YOU KNOW THE BROADER SUBJECT IS VERY IMPORTANT THE ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION MECHANICS BAR ARE NO SMALL THING- AND I AM GLAD TO ACCEPT MY COLLEAGUES OFFER- TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH ALL PARTIES. TO AMONG OTHER THINGS MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE CLEAR OBJECTIVES STANDARDS FOR MEASURING CARBON- AND SO THAT EVERYBODY PARTICIPATING THIS PROCESS- IS RECEIVING THE SAME GUIDANCE- AND COMING UP WITH DATA THAT IS- EQUIPMENT ON AN APPLES TO APPLES BASIS- AND ALSO IN SO DOING INSURING THAT THAT THE SMALLER PARTICIPANTS. IN SUPPLY CHAINS AREN'T UNINTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED BECAUSE OF THEIR INABILITY TO IT HERE- TO ANY DISNEY REQUIREMENTS SO WITH THAT. AND WE SHOULD THE AVERAGE AND WOULD WOULD COMMEND MY CALL. TO CONTINUE TO WITH ALSO TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN RESOLVE THAT WE CAN ALL LIVE WITH THANK YOU. SENATOR GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON MY A COLLEAGUE FROM SANDY'S COMMENTS AND HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. WILL YOU ACCEPT IT A QUESTION. HE WILL THANK YOU- I GUESS THERE IS SOME AMBIGUITY IS THE BILL IN YOUR INTENT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN GLOBAL REVENUE OR ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND- MEANING TOTAL REVENUE BUT LESS ALL EXPENSES OR IS IT TOTAL PROFIT SO IS IT TOTAL REVENUE. OR TOTAL PROFIT. THIRD THROUGH THE CHAIR- IT'S REVENUE IT IS TOTAL REVENUE SO I DO WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS FROM SANTEE TO TELL YOU THAT MOST OF THOSE BILLION DOLLAR CORPORATIONS DOING PLACE SMALL EMPLOYERS MEDIAN SIZE EMPLOYERS THAT PROVIDE TENS OF THOUSANDS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT EVERYBODY STEP INTO AN AMAZON POSITION- WHETHER YOU'RE SMALL MINORITY DISADVANTAGED- BUSINESS OWNER. YOU CAN STEP INTO THAT POSITION TO PROVIDE ALL THOSE JOBS FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE EMPLOYED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I THINK THAT THE COST OF TO THE REST OF THE GREEN TRANSITION IS ALREADY DISASTROUS IN UNDENIABLE IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S BEING PAID FOR IT AT THE VERY LIMITED DISCRETIONARY INCOME OF EVERY CALIFORNIANS. INCLUDING OUR MOST FOR THE PAY THE SAME GAS PRICES WE DO. AN ON A MINIMAL DISCRETIONARY INCOME. HIGHER COST OF LIVING HIGHER COST OF INFLATION HER GUTS TO GOODS OF TRANSPORTATION SO THAT ITEMS AND COMMODITIES CAN BE BROUGHT TO THE MARKET- THE LATEST GOVERNMENT CENSUS TELLS US THAT WE HAVE THE SECOND HIGHEST HOMELESS RATE IN THE NATION. BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE IT WAS STATED EARLIER ONE PAYCHECK AWAY FROM LOSING THEIR HOME- THIS FURTHER ADVANCES THAT. 36% OF THE HOMELESS OR NEAR THE POVERTY LEVEL. OR HOME SKEWS ME THIRTY SPUR 6% OF THE HOMES ARE AT NEAR OR AT THE POVERTY LEVEL EIGHTEEN POINT 2% OR BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL. THESE FIGURES ARE 45255% HIGHER EVERY STATE THAT BORDERS CALIFORNIA. FUEL COSTING CALIFORNIA ALREADY THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION BETWEEN 25235% HIGHER IN BORDERING STATES. I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF REPRESENTING THE SIXTEENTH SENATE DISTRICT AND THAT SPANS FROM CURRENT TO TULARE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO NEEDLES AND NEEDLES WHEN YOU GO TO NEEDLES YOU JUST HAVE TO DRIVE A QUARTER MILE UP ACROSS THE BRIDGE TO ARIZONA YOU PAY TWO DOLLARS LESS A GALLON FOR GAS. SO WHETHER YOU ARE WEALTHY OR YOU ARE POOR YOU STILL PAY HIGHER GAS PRICES IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF POLICIES THAT ACCESS TO GREEN TECHNOLOGY. FUEL COSTS IN CALIFORNIA THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION ELECTRICITY COSTS ARE TWO TO THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN ANY BORDERING STATE. YOU CREATE POVERTY INDUSTRY DISCRETIONARY INCOME WITH THE DETRIMENTAL POLICIES. THAT ARE PASSED IN THIS BUILDING. I ONCE HAD A ARE. HEARD WITH AN INDIVIDUAL AT THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS A COUPLE YEARS AGO. AND IT HAD TO DO WITH REVENUE SOURCES IT HAD TO DO WITH- BUDGETS. FOR THESE AGENCIES. AND I TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO THE THAT INDIVIDUAL AS WELL AS I'M GOING TO TRY TO EXPLAIN TO ALL OF YOU TODAY. THAT IS THE PRIVATE BUSINESS SECTOR. EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR THAT WE SPEND UP HERE. COMES FROM PRIVATE BUSINESS SECTOR. NOW YOU'LL SAY I PAY TAXES JUST LIKE THAT INDIVIDUAL AT THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD SAYS WILL I PAY TAXES. YEAH BUT YOU'RE A REGIONAL REVENUE SOURCE COMES FROM PRIVATE BUSINESS. SHE SAID SHE NEVER WORKED FOR PRIVATE BUSINESS WE FEE PRIVATE BUSINESS WE MAKE THEM PAY FOR PERMITS AND WE WILL MAKE THEM PAY I BELIEVE THIS THE ANALYSIS SAYS THAT THEY'LL BE FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERATED FROM THIS BILL. FROM PRIVATE BUSINESS TO FIND A RESOURCE BOARD POSITIONS. TO FUND GOVERNMENT. GOVERNMENT OUR SKIS ME PRIVATE BUSINESS PAYS EMPLOYEES THEY PAY TAXES ON THEIR PROPERTY THEY PAY TAXES ON THEIR REVENUE THEY PAY TAXES ON AND PAYING EMPLOYEES THEY PAID THOSE EMPLOYEES AT THE EMPLOYEE PAY TAXES AND ALL OF THAT REVENUE COMES TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO CONTINUE TO FILE- A PASS THAT LEGISLATION THAT HARMS PRIVATE BUSINESS WHERE WE HAVE AN EXODUS OF PEOPLE LEAVING THE STATE. IS JUST IT'S RIDICULOUS I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE EXPECT TO GET THE REVENUE THAT YOU WANT TO FOR THE POLICIES THAT THAT ARE PASSING OUT OF THIS BUSINESS. TO ADD ANOTHER COMMENT THAT MY COLLEAGUES- FROM SANTEE MADE WHICH IS A VERY GOOD ARGUMENT- THESE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT ALSO OPERATE GLOBALLY. IS IT A VIOLATION OF THE COMMERCE ACT AND I GUESS QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR IS IT A VIOLATION OF THE COMMISSARY QUESTION THE AUTHOR. WE ACCEPT ANOTHER QUESTION YES IS IT A VIOLATION OF THE COMMERCE ACT TO HAVE CALIFORNIA GO AFTER GLOBAL BUSINESSES. CAN CAN YOUR COME AFTER CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES. PROFESSOR YES I AM AND I MEAN LET ME JUST THAT HAVE YOU CONCLUDED THEN WE'LL HAVE HIM ANSWER THAT QUESTION AT THE CLOSE IF THAT'S OKAY. YOUR. IF YOU IF YOU WELL I'M I'M IN ASPEN CENTER GROVE TO CONCLUDE AND THAT WAY WE HAVE ALL THE QUESTIONS AND YOU CAN ASK AND ANSWER THEM IN YOUR CLOTHES WHAT THE DIFFERENCE OF THE PRESIDENT I'D LIKE TO HAVE THE QUESTION ANSWER NOW SURVIVE A FURTHER QUESTION I GET ASKED THAT IS WILL BASED ON A RESPONSE THAT HE'S GOING TO PROVIDE. THANK YOU MA'AM. YOU MAKE YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU A MEMBERS IF I MAY CLARIFY THE QUESTION DOES THE- DOES THE CENTER FROM BAKERSFIELD MEAN- COMMERCE CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION. YES OKAY- DANCERS NO THIS DOES NOT VIOLATE THE COMMERCE CLAUSE OF THE US CONSTITUTION WE WORK WITH OUR LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. TO MAKE SURE. AND IN FACT THIS BILL. FIRST OF ALL IT APPLIES TO COMPANIES. THAT DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. SO WE HAVE JURISDICTION AS A RESULT. IF THEY DON'T DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. IN A COVERED BY THIS BILL- IN ADDITION THE BILL DOES NOT REGULATE IN TERMS OF SAYING. YOU MUST. DO X. Y. AND Z. OR LOWER YOUR CARBON EMISSIONS. THE BILL REQUIRES THE PRODUCTION OF DATA. ITS INFORMATION. AND PEOPLE CAN DO WITH THAT INFORMATION. AS THEY WANT. THIS IS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND MAKING SURE THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS. TO INFORMATION THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES. THE INFORMATION IS VERY VERY POWERFUL. THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT A VIOLATION OF COMMERCE CLAUSE. THANK YOU FOR THAT. I DO AGREE THAT THE INFORMATION IS VERY VERY POWERFUL BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT. FINING BUSINESSES. FIFTY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY FOR NOT PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION. IS AGAIN A FINING AGAIN THE ANALYSIS IS FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION. FIRST OF. GOVERNMENT. THAT WE NEED. A STEP BACK IN LIEU AT HOW THESE GREEN CLIMB GOALS ARE THAT. NO ONE IN THIS BUILDING THE GUY HAS ME NO BONES ABOUT IT WE'RE HE'S GOING ON CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT IT JUST UNFAIRLY TARGETS INDIVIDUALS WHO DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. AND AND- TO DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA AND THE EMPLOYEE NOT ONLY. INDIVIDUALS DIRECTLY WITH THEIR COMPANY BUT HAVE THOUSANDS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CONTRACTORS. THAT ARE MID LEVEL BUSINESSES THAT PROVIDE JOBS TO INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE AND I THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE BETTER SUITED IN A FAIR JOB OF FEDERAL JURISDICTION. SO I WOULD RECOMMEND A NO VOTE THANK YOU. SENATOR DOLLY I UNDERSTAND YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AS WELL. YES CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN. AWESOME THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT- YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE LOOKED OVER THIS BILL AND- I'M A BUSINESS OWNER AND I'M DEFINITELY NOT A BUSINESS OWNER THAT- DOES GROW CELLS OF A BILLION DOLLARS. BUT I'LLI WORK AND LIVE IN THE STATE AND OUT FOR A LONG TIME AND THIS BILL IS JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE. OF REGULATION YOU KNOW YESTERDAY OUR PRESIDENT. WAS TALKING ABOUT INFLATION AND THE WAS BLAMING CORPORATIONS FOR INFLATION WELL IN CALIFORNIA THE ONLY PEOPLE TO BLAME FOR THE COST OF LIVING GOING UP IS THIS LEGISLATURE PASSING BILLS LIKE THIS ONE THAT WILL COST. CALIFORNIA COMPANIES MONEY A LOT OF MONEY TO GET THE DATA AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. PROVIDE THAT DATA YEAH THE DATA IS SOMETHING WE- ALL ONE HALF. BUT THAT'S THE REASON CALIFORNIA COMPANIES ARE LEADING WE LOST. TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS LAST YEAR THOSE CORPORATIONS PAY TAXES IN THE STATE AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO COST THE REVENUES TO DROP. S. AS THE CENTER FROM SANTEE MENTIONED ABOUT YOU ALL CAN'T GET ENOUGH PEOPLE OF THE VEHICLES TO MOVE PEOPLE OUT OF CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL AND MANY OTHER BILLS THAT ARE COMING FORWARD ABOUT CLIMATE GIVING POWER TO THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD FOR GIVING POWER. TO A LOT OF PEOPLE TO MAKE DECISIONS. THAT ARE GOING TO IN FACT CALIFORNIA. WHEN IN FACT WE DON'T EVEN COUNT A LOT OF THE CARBON. OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE GET SB THREE SIX THREE FIFTY. A FEW YEARS BACK THEY SAID WE WERE GOING TO COUNT. LARGE HYDRO WHICH WE DON'T COUNT WHICH IS CARBON NEUTRAL WE DON'T COUNT NUCLEAR WHICH IS CARBON NEUTRAL. THOSE ARE ALL THINGS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT WE TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE THIS BILL IS GONNA IMPACT BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA IT'S GONNA DRIVE THE COST OF LIVING UP WHICH IS ALREADY HIGHER THAN MOST PLACES IN THE UNITED STATES. AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS I OPPOSE THIS BILL AND I WISH I WAS THERE TODAY TO BE ABLE TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. SENATOR BAKER. THANK YOU BUT MY CAR IS A PRODUCT OF A LOT OF ISSUES THAT I ARGUE ARE REALLY TANGENTIAL TO THIS BILL IN THIS BILL REALLY IS A- CAN YOU HEAR ME OK. OKAY THIS BILL REALLY IS A REPORTING AND TRANSPARENCY BILL AND I FELT A RESPONSIBILITY TO RISE BECAUSE TWENTY YEARS AGO I WORKED FOR A SOFTWARE COMPANY THAT MANAGES WILL SUPPLY CHAINS FOR COMPANIES JUST THE BILL OF MATERIALS CHANGE MANAGEMENT. AND I GOT A CHANCE TO SEE THE SNOW THEY KNOW THE SUPPLY CHAINS IN IN INTIMATE DETAIL ACROSS THE WORLD AND SO I JUST WANTED TO RISE TO SAY THIS IS NOT IMPOSING SOME GIANT NEW A BURDEN. ON BUSINESSES THAT FOR EXAMPLE. I WOULD TAKE ONE BUSINESS H. P. I JUST LOOK THIS UP THEY COMMITTED AT LAST EARTH DAY TO REACH NET ZERO CARBON ACROSS THEIR VALUE CHAIN. TWENTY OPERATIONS SUPPLY CHAIN CUSTOMERS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BY TWENTY FORTY. CARBON NEUTRALITY IN ZERO WASTE IN THEIR H. P. OPERATIONS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. CARBON NEUTRALITY IN H. P. SUPPLY BUSINESS BY TWENTY THIRTY FINALLY ACHIEVED A GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. SCOPE ONE TO THREE BY TWENTY THIRTY TWO BASE ONE TWENTY NINETEEN EMISSIONS YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT HAVING THE DATA. AND I DID ANOTHER QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH. THE CARBON- ACCOUNTING BUSINESS ALREADY IS DIED ABOUT TEN BILLION DOLLARS TO THE MARKET FOR CARBON ACCOUNTING SOFTWARE SO. THIS IS WELL UNDERSTOOD THIS IS WELL UNDERWAY WALMART'S DOING IT PERHAPS BECAUSE DOING IT LEADING COMPANIES ARE DOING IT WE TRY TO MAKE SURE THIS. HAT THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE FOR ALL COMPANIES SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ALL THAT. REALLY THE PRESSURES NOT TO COME FROM GOVERNMENT IT'S GOING TO COME FROM INVESTORS AND CONSUMERS TO HELP. THESE COMPANIES. HAVE MOVED TO AND THAT'S YOUR FUTURE SO I JUST WANT TO REMARK IT'S NOT IMPOSING HUGE NEW BURDEN THIS IS WELL UNDERSTOOD AND IT'S JUST REALLY APPLYING IT. TOUCHES THE LEADING EDGE COMPANIES TO REALLY ALL COMPANIES OF THAT SIZE THANK YOU PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN OF THE SENATE WILL WE EVER STOP IN CALIFORNIA TRYING TO DRIVE BUSINESSES OUT. THIS IS A SCARLET LETTER BILL. IT'S A GOOD WAY TO DESCRIBE IT. TO DISCOURAGE BUSINESSES. TO ENTICE BUSINESSES TO GO TO OTHER STATES BIGGEST OF THE BIG ARE LEAVING CALIFORNIA. THIS IS NO LONGER GOING TO BE THE HIGH TECH HEADQUARTERS OF THE WORLD. IN FACT IT SHOULDN'T EVEN BE NOW BECAUSE OUR HIGH TECH STUFF IN THE STATE NEVER WORKS. AT LEAST AS IT IS APPLIED TO STATE GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS AND OPERATIONS. HAVE WE EVER HAD A MAJOR MULTI BILLION DOLLAR HIGH TECH APPLICATIONS THANK PHYS CAL. THE HAS WORKED OVER DECADES NOW. I THINK IT'S PRETTY SORRY STORY. BUT THAT SAID WE'RE NOT VOTING HERE TODAY ON THAT POINT BUT WE'RE VOTING ON ANOTHER SIGNAL TO THE WORLD NOT JUST TEXAS. FLORIDA. SEVEN TAKE A BUSINESSES. THEY'RE GOING TO GO FRIDAY. MANY MIGHT NOT HAVE READ THAT. FAMOUS AND RAND BOOK ATLAS SHRUGGED. BUT THAT WAS CAN SHRUG WE'RE TALKING HERE ABOUT THE PRODUCERS. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CITIZENS OUR FELLOW CITIZENS WHO WORK AT THESE COMPANIES. THAT ARE BEING TOLD WE DON'T WANT YOU. WE'RE GONNA FRONT YOU OFF WE'RE GONNA SHINE YOU. SUNDAY OUR GRANDCHILDREN. WILL PAY THE PRICE IN FACT THEY ALREADY ARE. FEB OR JUST. MMHM. THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION BASIC SENATOR ALLEN WELL I MEAN WITH WITH SO MUCH RESPECT TO OUR COLLEAGUE THERE ARE CHILDREN. PAYING THE PRICE IS EXACTLY WHY WE'RE TRYING TO WORK ON A BILL LIKE THIS ARE GIVEN THE SEVERITY OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR BASED ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT I MADE IS THAT- IF YOU BECAUSE YOU AND I. DO NOT A QUESTION. YOU WILL. SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AT THIS BILL. IMPACTS OF THOSE COMPANIES THAT DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA RATHER THAN THOSE THAT ARE. THAT ARE BASED IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN THE CAUGHT SO WE IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT. I'M THROUGH THE CHAIR- YES THAT IS CORRECT THIS BILL APPLIES TO COMPANIES TO DO BUSINESS HERE. IT IS NOT LIMITED TO COMPANIES THAT ARE HEADQUARTERED HERE SO THIS IS NOT A SITUATION WHERE. YOU BUY LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS NOT A SITUATION WHERE IF YOU DO A FAKE MOVE LIKE TESLA DID. TESLA DIDN'T REALLY MOVE. BABY INCORPORATED OR MOVE THEIR HEADQUARTERS TO TEXAS AND EXPANDED THEIR OPERATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT MOVING YOUR HEADQUARTERS WILL NOT GET YOU OUT OF THIS BILL IF YOU'RE STILL DOING BUSINESS HERE BECAUSE TESLA IS STILL SELLING AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF CARS HERE. AFTER WE SUBSIDIZE THE HECK OUT OF THE COMPANY TO GET THEM WHERE THEY ARE. TODAY SO THIS IS ABOUT DOING BUSINESS HERE I DON'T THINK THAT CHEVRON IS GOING TO CLOSE ALL OF ITS GAS STATIONS IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GOD FOR BID. PROVIDE DATA I DON'T THINK AMAZON IS GOING TO SHUT DOWN ALL OF ITS WAREHOUSES AND DELIVERIES IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE SOME DATA I DON'T THINK MOVERS GOING TO SHUT DOWN ITS OPERATIONS. IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE SOME DATA- DOES NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IT'S ABOUT DOING BUSINESS HERE. NOT BEING HEADQUARTERED HERE. OKAY I'M OBVIOUSLY IF YOU WERE TO FOCUS ON THOSE HEADQUARTERED HERE I THINK THEY'LL BE VERY PROBLEMATIC BUT THE REASON WHY. I RESPECTFULLY PUSH BACK ON SOME OF THE COMMON MADE. AT CERTAINLY GONNA SUPPORT THIS GIVEN THE SEVERITY THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND THE NEED FOR DATA COLLECTION. THERE'S NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SENATOR WHEN YOU MAY CONCLUDE I THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOT A PRESIDENT BECAUSE I DO APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DEBATE AND WE SHOULD BE HAVING ROBUST DEBATE WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE EMERGENCY NEED FOR CLIMATE ACTION I AGREE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PRESSURE IS BEING PUT ON MIDDLE INCOME AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND THE STATE AND AROUND THE WORLD. AND WHAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ONE OF THE BIGGEST PRESSURE POINTS ON THEM. IT'S NOT REQUIRING BILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES TO PROVIDE DATA. IT'S THE COST OF HOUSING AND I THANK MY COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE WHO SUPPORTED HOUSING POLICY. TO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE HERE THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE LEAVING CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD HOUSING. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS DOING TO PEOPLE IT'S NOT THE RICH PEOPLE BUT IT'S TURNING. ITS LOW INCOME PEOPLE. MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN FIRE ZONES AND HAVING THEIR HOMES BURNED DOWN PEOPLE WHO ARE SUBJECT TO FLOODING BECAUSE THEY LIVE IN. LOW LYING AREAS IN TOWN FOR TO MOVE UP INTO THE HILLS. RETURNING PEOPLE WHOSE KIDS ARE GETTING ASTHMA. IT'S HURTING PEOPLE WHO LACK ACCESS TO FOOD BECAUSE OF THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. ON THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR THAT IS WHAT IS HURTING PEOPLE THE MOST AND IT'S GOING TO ACCELERATE OVER TIME. THIS BILL CALLING I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU ISABEL TRANSPARENCY AND DATA THAT'S ALL I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE MY SIX YEAR NOW USUALLY DATA. TRANSPARENCY BILLS FLY OFF OF THIS WAR UNANIMOUSLY ARE CLOSE TO UNANIMOUSLY. BECAUSE EVERYONE AGREES HAVING MORE DATA AND INFORMATION IS GOOD AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT FOR THE MARKET TO WORK YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT TRANSPARENCY AND THAT'S WHAT THIS WILL DO THIS WILL HELP THE MARKET WORK I RESPECTFULLY ASTRONOMICAL.

I UNDERSTAND SHE HAS BIRTHDAY CAKE IN OUR OFFICE SO. JUST KIDDING WE CAN GET TOGETHER AND OFFICES JUST KIDDING WE'LL SEE YOU ALL AT ONE FIFTEEN THIS AFTERNOON. WE'RE ON CONSIDERATION OF THE DAILY FILE. AND WE ARE STILL ON SENATE THIRD READING SO WE'D LIKE TO TAKE UP FILE ITEM NUMBER TWENTY SEVEN WHICH IS SENATOR MCGUIRE HE'S READY PLEASE READ. SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION FIFTY THREE BY SENATOR MCGUIRE RELATIVE TO CLIMATE CHANGE CENTER MCGUIRE THE FLOOR IS YOURS. HOW MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT S. C. R. FIFTY THREE IS A CRITICAL RESOLUTION DECLARES A CLIMATE EMERGENCY THAT THREATENS THE STATE OUR NATION AND OUR PLAN I DON'T KNOW I WANT TO SPEAK. S. C. R. FIFTY THREE ALSO PROCLAIMS THE GOLDEN STATE'S COMMITMENT TO DOING EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO COMBAT THIS GROWING CRISIS. I KNEW ANALYSIS BY THE EUROPEAN UNION'S CLIMATE CHANGE SERVICE WHICH TRACKS GLOBAL TEMPERATURES AND OTHER CLIMATE INDICATORS FOUND THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WAS THE FIFTH WARMEST YEAR ON RECORD IN WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT WESTERN STATES ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO EXTREME DROUGHT LARGER MORE DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES IN OUR- COASTAL COMMUNITIES ARE ALREADY EXPECTING. ARE ALREADY EXPERIENCING SEA LEVEL CHANGES. WHILE WE IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORICALLY LED THIS NATION ON EMISSION REDUCTION EFFORTS NOW MORE THAN EVER WE MUST REDOUBLE OUR FOCUS TO COMBAT THIS CLIMATE CRISIS IN DECLARE A CLIMATE EMERGENCY WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR. AN AYE VOTE. MEMBERS IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. YES I WANT TO SPEAK RUSSIAN OR DEBATE. SENATOR DOLLY. CAN YOU HEAR ME MADAM CHAIR WE CAN THANK YOU THE- THIS RESOLUTION- I HAVE I HEARD IN- EQ AND- I HAD SOME QUESTIONS THAT I DIDN'T STILL GOT ANSWERED VERY WELL LOOK THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT- WE'VE SEEN CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE THE ATTEMPTED TO BE A LEADER IN. THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE MY QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR WOULD- DURING EACH YOU WAS- THE I WANT TO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE POLICIES WE HAVE IN PLACE RIGHT NOW AND THOSE WERE ADDRESSED ACTIVELY LOOKING CALIFORNIA FLORIDA LEAD I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT CARBON IN GENERAL- I DID A BILL LAST YEAR- TO CAL CARBON FROM FOREST FIRES WHICH CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY DOESN'T COUNT. THE AMOUNT EMISSIONS THAT COME FROM FOREST FIRES NOW WE CAN'T BERMAN FROM- TRANSPORTATION. WE COUNT CARBON FROM. ENERGY PRODUCTION AND ALL THOSE THINGS BUT WE DON'T COUNT. THE CARBON THAT IS- SPEWED OUT IN FORCE FIRES WHICH IS THE LARGEST. CARBON EMITTER IN CALIFORNIA AND THE WORLD IN SO. I THINK THAT THIS THIS RESOLUTION IS GOING TO LEAD US AYE AYE THERE WAS TALK DURING EACH YEAR THAT. MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND THAT WOULD MEAN THAT TO. THE GOVERNOR WOULD THEN BE IN CONTROL JUST LIKE HE IS- HERE TO THE STATE OF EMERGENCY WITH OUR HEALTH CRISIS. IN FOR ME I THINK THAT IS VERY DANGEROUS AND I THINK THE POLICIES THAT COME OUT OF A OF THIS HOUSE- IN THIS IN THIS LEGISLATURE ARE. FLAWED CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. LAST YEAR HAD AN AUDIT IN THEY- DETERMINED DURING THAT AUDIT THAT- THEY WEREN'T DOING A GOOD JOB OF SPENDING HAT. MONEY OF CALIFORNIANS THROUGH. THEIR RESOURCES BOARD AND WHAT WE WERE GETTING FROM. ALL THESE POLICIES IS DRIVING UP THE COST OF LIVING IS DRIVING UP OUR ENERGY WE PAY ANYWAY MOST PLACES IN THE NATION. AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY IN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T COUNT- NUCLEAR IN. IN OUR ENERGY AS AS A CARBON NEUTRAL WE DON'T COUNT A LARGE HYDRO ONLY THIRTY MEGAWATTS OF LAST. A WIRED THOSE COUNTED AND WIRE WIRE THOSE POLICIES NOT TALK ABOUT WETALK ABOUT- YOU KNOW DOING MORE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BUT IT DID BUT WHILE WE'RE DOING REALLY IS WERE EXPORTING JOBS. FROM CALIFORNIA TO COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA THAT ARE. OR WHITE FRANKLY BUILDING COAL FIRED POWER PLANTS IT'S AS WE SPEAK AND WE'RE BREATHING THAT AIR SO I THINK THE POLICY IS WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO TALK ABOUT NOT JUST MAKING A STATEMENT AND IN. MAKING PEOPLE. MORE FEARFUL THAT'S REALLY LEAD IF WE'RE GONNA LEADING CALIFORNIA'S LEADING US LET'S DO SOME REAL GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL WORK AND THAT MEANS. LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT THE FORCES TALK ABOUT A WATERSHED JUST TALK ABOUT THE WILDLIFE THAT IS IT DID DID DID DESPERATELY NEEDS. TO BE LOOKED AT NOT JUST STATING F. THIS RESOLUTION IS SAYING HEY WE IT'S A CLIMATE EMERGENCY YEP NO DOUBT WHEN A CRIME IS NOT AN ALMOST A MILLION ACRE FIRE. BUT WE DON'T DO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT FIRES WERE REGULATING LAWN MOWERS WEED EATERS. AND GENERATORS WHICH WE NEED BECAUSE WE ARE POWER OUTAGES THAT'S THE STUFF THAT JUST LEGISLATURE DOING IS WHAT'S COSTS. CAUSING CALIFORNIA TO PAY HIGHER IN BUILDING FEES HIGHER IN. IN THE TRANSPORTATION COST. AND THAT'S WHAT'S THE REALLY THE PROBLEM HERE CALIFORNIA THAT'S CAUSING INFLATION TO GO UP AND IS THE RESULT OF THE LACK OF THIS LEGISLATURE DOING REAL GOOD. ENVIRONMENTAL WORK I'M LOOKING FOR SOME ENVIRONMENTS THAT REALLY CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT THE WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND NOT JUST. REGULATE AND PUT FEAR INTO THE PEOPLE LET'S TALK ABOUT THE POLICIES. THAT COME OUT OF THIS LEGISLATURE IN THIS BILL THIS BILL. IS- IS THIS GONNA DO MORE HERE AND IT IS GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEMS ARE WE HAVE A BULLET TRAIN. WE'RE SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THAT IS NOT EVER GOING TO GET OUR- CARBON REDUCED. ITS BECAUSE SPECIAL INTERESTS IS RUNNING THIS AND IT'S REALLY NOT ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT I PREFER TO BE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT SHOULD INCLUDE FORCE FIRE. YOUR CARBON OUTPUT. SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'M NOT GONNA BE SUPPORTING THIS LEGISLATION. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ADAMS CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WAS GOING TO SPEAK ON THIS BUT I DO WANT TO GO OVER SINCE. TOPICS BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIEBER BROUGHT SOME STUFF UP. EARLIER I TALKED ABOUT THE MOST REST THE COST OF RUSHED TO GREEN AND TRANSITION. IS ALREADY DISASTER BULL AND DISASTROUS AND- DENIABLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE TALKED ABOUT- HOMELESSNESS MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER TALKED ABOUT THE COST OF ENERGY THE COST OF FUEL AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T REALIZE IS THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THE NUMBER ONE PURCHASER OF ECUADORIAN OIL. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM THE OIL THAT'S PRODUCED IN ECUADOR. IT'S AN ALTERNATIVE TO LOCAL AND GAS PRODUCTION AND IMPORTATION FROM FOREIGN SOURCES. WE PRODUCE ENERGY HEARING CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY IN KERN COUNTY OIL AND GAS ENERGY. WHICH YOUR CALL YOUR CONSTITUENTS MY CONSTITUENTS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COULD NOT LIVE A COMFORTABLE OR A LIFE OF COMFORT THAT WE HAVE NOW WITHOUT THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. AND WE IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T NEED OR USE THE OIL AND GAS THAT IS PRODUCED. WE JUST DON'T PRODUCE IT IN OUR BACKYARD LIKE NIMBYISM RIGHT WILL TEAR DOWN THE ECUADORIAN RAIN STORES FOREST. WILL FIND CHINESE CORPORATIONS ON NATIONAL OIL THIS THE IMPORT THAT BOYLE HERE TO CALIFORNIA. AND SO THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS CAN LIVE COMFORTABLE LIVES WHEN YOU LOOK AT CALIFORNIA THAT BUYS ITS VOCAL OR EXCUSE ME THE BULK OF ITS OIL IMPORTS. WE RASHT- POLICIES THAT ARE ENSURING THAT CHINA. WHILE WE FINANCE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT ACCELERATE GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGES AND GLOBAL WARMING. IN ECUADOR IF YOU LOOK AT PHOTOGRAPHS OR THINGS LIKE A KERN COUNTY PRESENTATION OR PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE ECUADORIAN RAINFOREST THE RIVERS THAT ARE THERE. THE CHILDREN THAT ARE LIKE TEN YEARS OLD COVER AND COVERED IN OIL THE RIVERS FLOODED WITH OIL WE ALLOW THAT BECAUSE WE FIND THEIR OIL PRODUCTION. I CAN TELL YOU COLLEAGUES WERE WE YOU 70% OF THE STATE'S OILING KERN COUNTY WE DO NOT HAVE RIVERS FLOODED WITH OIL WE DO NOT HAVE CHILDREN BURIED IN OIL. A COVERED IN OIL AS THEY WORK THROUGH THE OIL IN THE ECUADORIAN CAN COUNTRIES I CAN ALSO TELL YOU THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS AGAIN. CANNOT LIVE WITH THE COMFORT AND AFFORDABILITY WITHOUT THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS THE GOVERNOR KNOWS THAT WHEN HE THOUGHT THAT THAT THE GROUP WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO. HELP HOLD WHAT WE WERE USING IN CALIFORNIA HE IMMEDIATELY DID AN EXECUTIVE IN ORDER TO FIRE RIPS A FIVE CALIFORNIA GAS PLANTS. HE WOULDN'T DO THAT IF YOU DIDN'T THINK THAT WE NEEDED IT WE HAVE TO RELY ON OIL AND GAS- YOU GUYS OF THE GIN MADE NO BONES ABOUT. YOUR GOALS ABOUT SHUTTING DOWN LOCAL OIL PRODUCTION YOUR BIG NO BONES ABOUT THE GOALS THAT YOU HAVE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT ALTHOUGH SOUND REALLY GOOD IN AN ELECTION CYCLE BUT ONCE THESE POLICIES PASSING LOOK AT EIGHT OF YOUR DESTRUCTION BY FOLLOWING. THIS PEOPLE IN POVERTY. WILL NOT BE A TO AFFORD THE POLICIES AND THE COST OF LIVING WITHOUT THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT EVERYTHING. AT THE OIL AND GAS AND- SHE PAYS OR EMPLOYEES PEOPLE I'M TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT WE USE EVERY DAY FROM EVERY TIME YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AT TOUCHER ALARM CLOCK TO THE BUTTONS ON MOST OF YOUR GUISES SHIRTS. TO THE GLASSES ON MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE FRIEND SAN FRANCISCO IT'S ALL PETROLEUM BY PRODUCTS THOSE DOES- CLEARS- BRACE THINGS TO CORRECT YOUR TEETH. ALL HAVE A PETROLEUM BY PRODUCTS MOST OF THE STUFF THAT WE USE AND HOW HOSPITAL'S PETROLEUM BY PRODUCTS WITHOUT PETROLEUM INDUSTRY PRODUCTS. THIS WOULD BE A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY TAKE THE FIVE POOREST COUNTRIES IN THE NATION THEY HAVE NO PETROLEUM AND NO OIL AND GAS. SO TO SET A GOAL EVEN THOUGH IT'S A NON BINDING RESOLUTION BUT TO SET A GOAL OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THIS STATE CAPITOL TO DESTROY AGAIN NIMBYISM. YOU DON'T WANT TO PRODUCE IT HERE UNDER THE STRICTEST MOST ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY PRO LAWS IN THE MOST EXTREME JUST LABOR LAWS IN THE WORLD. BUT YOU LET THEM TEAR DOWN THE RAINFOREST- YOU'LL LET THEM TAKE AWAY INDIGENOUS INDIANS- YOU KNOW THE AREA OF SPACE THAT THEY LIVE IN JUST TO GET THOSE SAME COMFORTS THAT YOU ENJOY YOUR CONSTITUENTS ENJOY EVERY DAY TO HAVE OIL BROUGHT HERE ACROSS OUR ECOSYSTEM. IN VESSELS THAT BUNKER FUEL THAT PUT MORE CARBON EMISSIONS OUT INTO THE AIR. ALMOST PROBABLY EQUIVALENT TO OVER A PRETTY DECENT WILDFIRE SO I WOULD JUST ASK YOUR NO VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT GLOBAL WARMING AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND IT IS. EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK IT IS ABOUT YOU KNOW DISASTROUS IT'S COMING THEN LET'S ADDRESS IT FROM A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE AND USE THE MOST. RELIABLE CHEAP RELIABLE ENERGY THAT SAFE AND PRODUCED HERE IN CALIFORNIA BEFORE IMPORTING ALL THESE- THESE PRODUCTS FROM THE COUNTRY THE NUMBER ONE IS HOSTILE AS HAS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS THAT ARE DISMAL. AND ALSO HAS A POOR ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO THE- THIRTY FURTHER DISCUSSION. OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. THIS EIGHT. THANK CENTER MCGUIRE YOU MAKE THANK YOU SO MUCH BETTER PRESS IN A GREAT FOR THIS COME JUSTICE AYE AYE I MISS US BE APOLOGISED TO BE AYE YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MA'AM AND I WAS JUST TRYING TO GET OVER TO MY NEED I CAN TO GET THE- I AM REALLY COMES. IN THE WRESTLE. WHILE LIKE WITH THIS. I BELIEVE THAT'S A SPORT. BOB FEAR AT- THERE SAID THE STAGE FOR THE DUMB TO. DECLARE A STATEWIDE CLIMATE. AND OUT WHO A LOT ADDITIONALLY THERE POWER AND TRY TO THE FIGHT AT ALSO QUOTE EITHER ONE OF THOSE LATER CYBER NOTION THAT A RESOLUTION PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE COULD BE INTERPRETED AS GRANTING THE GOVERNOR NEW EXECUTIVE POWERS. ARE I DON'T WANT. US ANYONE OF OUR ACTIONS TO BE INTERPRETED AS SENDING OUT STAGE FOR THE GOVERNOR TO TAKE THE ANNUAL UNILATERAL ACTION. BY THE NAME OF CLIMB EMERGENCY AS WE ALL KNOW THE POWERS OF THE GOVERNOR ARE ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE CONSTITUTION. AND ENHANCED THROUGH STATUTE NOT THROUGH A RESOLUTION. AND I AM CONCERNED ABOUT WE HAVE HAD THE GOVERNOR VERY INVOLVED WITH EXECUTIVE POWERS DURING THE HEALTH. CRISIS AND WE KNOW WHERE THAT HAS LED OUT WE HAVE A DISTRUST OF THE GOVERNMENT. I IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S SO TO TELL A TEAR IN GOVERNMENT TOO MANY OF THE PEOPLE ARE YOUR FRIENDS BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR'S MAKING ALL THE DECISIONS BY PASSING US. IN I DON'T THINK ANY ONE OF US SHOULD AGREE THAT THAT'S THE PROPER WAY TO GOVERN. UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION SHOULD BE OPERATING IN THIS JUST ABOUT THE NEW STAGE FOR THAT. SO I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT EVEN THOUGH I DO SUPPORT. OF THE SPIRIT OF IT I THINK WE'RE ALL VERY CONCERNED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE I MENTIONED THAT MY DISTRICT SEES THE RISE. IF THERE ARE WHAT ARE THE CAUSES THERE ARE MANY THAT. WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE THE LEGISLATURE INVOLVED WE NEED TO BASE OUR DECISIONS ON SCIENCE. IN NACHO ANECDOTES FROM OUR- AREA SO GROUPS OF SUPPORT FOR ANYTHING ABOUT CLIMATE- THEY WANT. IMMEDIATELY TO REMOVE. YOU KNOW EVERYTHING YOU KNOW DRUG I GUESS GET US BACK TO LIVING ON THE LAND IN DANCE THAT. ARE. I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO VOTE FOR TODAY AND IF IT GOES FORWARD WILL CONTINUE MY OWN. THANK YOU DEBATE. SAYING NOW CENTERMAN I THINK SOME IN A PRESS. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT FACT HERE. THE FACT IS RIGHT NOW. WE ARE FACING A CLIMATE CRISIS. WE CAN CONTINUE TO WRING OUR HANDS WE CAN CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IT OR WE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION AND- DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO AND WHAT THE GOVERNOR CAN DO. SO FIRST AND FOREMOST. EVERYONE KNOWS IN THIS CHAMBER WAS SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW THIS. RESOLUTION DOES NOT AFFECT. THE GOVERNOR'S ABILITY TO ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. THE GOVERNOR REGARDLESS OF THIS RESOLUTION CAN ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ON THE CLIMATE CRISIS RIGHT NOW. WE ALSO KNOW LET'S NOT PRETEND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT IS WHAT GUIDES THE GOVERNOR WHEN IT COMES TO DECLARING A STATE OF EMERGENCY. SO IT'S HOGWASH THAT THIS IS GOING TO EMPOWER THE GOVERNOR. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE. IS ON RECORD BOTH WITH THIS RESOLUTION INTERACTION SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ACTION. OUR PRESIDENT PRO TEM. OUR PRESIDENT PRO TEM IS LEADING THE WAY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE ACTION. HE'S BRINGING TOGETHER A BROAD GROUP OF SENATORS. TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE AN AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE ACTION. POLICY AND BUDGET PLAN THIS YEAR. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS ONE RESOLUTION IT'S NOT ABOUT ONE RESOLUTIONS ABOUT COLLECTIVE ACTION THAT THIS LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO TAKE. AND THE RIGHT LEADERS IN THE RIGHT SEAT RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S TONI ATKINS. AND SHE'S GONNA BE ADVANCING ONE OF THE BOLDEST CLIMATE ACTION PLAN THAT WE'VE SEEN IN YEARS HERE IN THE STATE CAPITAL. SO YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT CHANGE LOOKS LIKE. HANG ON. AND THE LAST THING I'M GONNA SAY IT'S LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS GOVERNOR AND WILDFIRE. THERE IS NO WHETHER GOVERNOR. REGARDLESS IF YOU AGREE WITH THIS POLITICS OR NOT THERE IS NO OTHER GOVERNOR. IN MODERN HISTORY THAT IS INVESTED AS MUCH AS GOVERNOR NEWSOM WHEN IT COMES TO WILDFIRE RESILIENCE WHEN IT COMES TO WILDFIRE RESPONSE AND WHEN IT COMES TO PROACTIVE ACTION LIKE. FOREST THINNING IN WHEN IT COMES TO ISSUES OF A WILDFIRE BREAKS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH HIM POLITICALLY THAT'S JUST BE CANDID GO AND LOOK AT THE FACTS. THE BUDGET IS WHERE OUR VALUES ARE ACT. IN IF WE VALUE THE FUTURE FOR OUR KIDS AND WE HAVE TO COMBAT THIS CLIMATE CRISIS. IN THE ONLY PLACE BY THE WAY I'M GOING TO SPEAK FOR MYSELF THE ONLY PLACE WHERE THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY. IT'S CONTROVERSIAL IS IN THIS LEGISLATURE. YOU POLL PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE AND NATION THEY'RE SCARED TO DEATH OF WHAT THE FUTURE IS GOING TO MEAN FOR THEIR KIDS BECAUSE OF THIS CLIMATE CRISIS. SO WHAT I THINK THAT WE ALL NEED TO DO IS WORK TOGETHER AS WE ALWAYS HAVE IN A BIPARTISAN WAY. TO COMBAT THIS CRISIS BECAUSE THE CLOCK IS TICKING. THE LIGHT IS REDDER ALARM THE ALARM IS SOUNDING RIGHT NOW SO WHAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK. IS FOR A AYE VOTE ON FILE ITEM TWENTY SEVEN TO BE ADDED TO DECLARE A CLIMATE EMERGENCY. AND LET'S GET THE WORK DONE THIS YEAR TO COMBAT THIS CRISIS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALLEN AYE ARCHULETA AYE ATKINS FIVE BAKER HI FOR JUST. BRADFORD HI CABALLERO.

SENATE BILL TWO THIRTY BY SENATOR PORTANTINO AN ACT RELATING TO DRINKING WATER SENATOR PORTANTINO THE FLOOR'S YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS SB TWO THIRTY THE STATEWIDE CONSTITUENTS OF EMERGING CONCERN IN DRINKING WATER PROGRAM. WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A DEDICATED CVC PROGRAM FOR FIVE YEARS TO IMPROVE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE OCCURRENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE IN DRINKING WATER SOURCES. CONSTITUENTS OF EMERGING CONCERN OR CEC'S AS THEY ARE KNOWN OUR DIVERSE GROUP OF SYNTHETIC OR NATURALLY OCCURRING CHEMICALS OR MICRO ORGANISMS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY REGULATED IN DRINKING WATER SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED NEW WAYS TO DETECT THEM IN VERY SMALL AMOUNTS USED TO BE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT MEASURING CHEMICALS IN PARTS PER MILLION. TEN PARTS PER BILLION AND NOW WE CAN DETECT DOWN TO PARTS FOR CHORE PER TRILLION. GIVEN THIS CAPABILITY SCIENTISTS WILL CONTINUE TO DETECT NEW UNREGULATED CHEMICALS THAT COULD INCLUDE PHARMACEUTICALS PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS OR INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS IN TRACE AMOUNTS SB TWO THIRTY IS THAT IS IT IS DESIGNED TO HELP THE STATE WATER BOARD GATHER INFORMATION TO UNDERSTAND THE PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS. OF THESE CHEMICALS AND THEIR CURRENTS IN DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES THIS INFORMATION WOULD HELP THE STATE WATER BOARD MAKE INFORMED SCIENCE BASED DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO PRIORITIZE AND FORM REGULATION. THE BILL REQUIRES THE STATE WATER BOARD TO CREATE A SCIENCE ADVISORY PANEL MADE UP OF EXPERTS TO ADVISE AND THEN TO CREATE IN THE STATE TREASURY ACTION FUND WHICH UPON APPROPRIATION WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE WATER BOARD TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAMS. THE BILL WAS AMENDED AFTER PASSING OUT OF THE SENATE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY- COMMITTEE LAST YEAR TO MODIFY THE DURATION OF THE PROGRAM TO FIVE YEARS AND EXCLUDE P. FOSS FROM THE PROGRAM OF REVIEW AND REQUIRE THE STATE WATER BOARD TO PROVIDE A FINAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. MUCH WORK IS BEING DONE AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL TO ADDRESS S. P. FOSS AND I SHOULD THOSE EFFORTS. THIS IS A CLASS OF CHEMICALS FOUND. IN CONSUMER COMMERCIAL AD INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS PRODUCTS PRODUCTS SOME OF WHICH ARE KNOWN TO BE HARMFUL AND HAVE HARMFUL HEALTH EFFECTS. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

SENATE BILL FOR SIXTY SEVEN BY SENATOR WIENER AN ACT RELATING TO TRIAL TESTIMONY CENTER WIENER THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TODAY TO RESIGN AS BEFORE SIXTY SEVENTY AND WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS OCT. BY THIS BILL CLARIFIES IT EXPERT OPINIONS OF VALUES VALID METHODOLOGY RESEARCH PEER REVIEWED STUDIES WERE SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND DATA DO NOT SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSIBLE EXPERT TESTIMONY- THE BILL ALSO- VOWED TO EXPAND THE-DEFINITION OF FALSE TESTIMONY TO INCLUDE OPINIONS. BASED ON FLAWED SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ELEVATED TECHNOLOGY AND DISPUTED QUOTE UNQUOTE SCIENTIFIC OPINIONS. FINALLY THE BILL WILL HELP PROVIDE POST CONVICTION RELIEF FOR ANYONE WHO WAS CONVICTED USING EXPERT TESTIMONY BUT RELIED ON FLAWED SCIENCE RESEARCH WHEN SOMEONE IS WRONGFULLY CONVICTED OF A CRIME- IS A HORRIBLE MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE- IT MEANS THAT AN INNOCENT PERSON IS IMPRISONED. AND THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY COMMITTED THE CRIME- IS ON FILE HI IN SOCIETY- TODAY OUR COURTS HAVE- DISCRETION OVER WHICH EXPERT TESTIMONY IS ADMISSIBLE. HOWEVER STUDIES SHOW THE COURTS TYPICALLY ACCEPT MOST FORENSIC SCIENCE AND EXPERT TESTIMONY WITH L. MUCH SCRUTINY LEAVING SIGNIFICANT ROOM FOR LACK OF PRECISION AND FRANKLY FOR HUMAN ARE- THIS LEADS TO AN UNACCEPTABLY. HIGH RATE OF FRAUD CONVICTION. CUSTOMER THE FELL THROUGH ON LOGIC AND- SHE NOT BE IN IN COURT. I WOULD THAT FRIENDS ARE SCIENCE A LEE CAUSE OF WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS- AND WE HAVE A CHANCE TO REALLY TACKLE THAT ISSUE TODAY. EXPERT OPINIONS COLLEAGUES WE KNOW CAN BE EXTREMELY PERSUASIVE AND INFLUENTIAL IN THE OUTCOME OF A TRIAL AND ONCE THE JUDGE ALLOWS TESTIMONY AND- IT'S VERY VERY HARD TO OVERCOME IT EVEN IF IT IS DEEPLY. FLAWED THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES- TO ASSISTED AND STATED THAT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THIS PROBLEM AS WE YOU PROBABLY HEARD IS THE SO CALLED CSI- FACT WERE JURORS HAVE AN UNREALISTIC AND PRECONCEIVED NOTION. ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF PRECISION OF FORENSIC EVIDENCE IN CRIMINAL TRIALS. SB FOUR SIXTY SEVEN WILL HAVE EXONERATE INNOCENT PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND IT WILL PROVIDE JUDGES WITH STRONGER TOOLS AND GUARDRAILS I TO MAKE SURE THE FLAWED SCIENCE DOES NOT MAKE ITS WAY INTO THE COURT ROOM. S. FRONT I'VE- THREE. EIGHT ZERO. SENATOR I'M SORRY. THAT A PRESS JONES SENATE I URGE A NO VOTE. WHEN WILL A THIS EVER BE. NOW WE'RE TO HIGH TO EXPERTS. EXPERT FOR MOST RECENT STUDIES. WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE VALIDITY OR CREDIBILITY OR PEERREVIEW OR WHATEVER. BASED ON ALLEGATIONS. THESE ARE JUST MORE ATTEMPTS TO BE ROLLED THE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT JUSTICE FOR THE VICTIMS OF CRIMES DO NOT SEE JUSTICE DONE. THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES HAVE MORE VENUES TO ESCAPE ANY CONSEQUENCES FOR THEIR BEHAVIORS EXHAUSTED WILL QUEST. TO HAVE NOBODY DO ANYTHING WRONG. WHY DON'T WE JUST GET RID OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE COURT SHUT HIM DOWN. HEATHER BE NO PENALTIES AND NO CRIME BOISE HOW GREAT IS WORKED OUT REALIGNED. WONDERFUL THE DUMBING DOWN OF CRIME ACROSS AMERICA. LOOK AT AMERICA'S CITIES UPON CITIES AND WHAT'S GOING ON WITHIN THOSE CITIES RIGHT NOW IS JUST AMERICA FOR THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN I THINK NOT AND THERE'S MORE OF THESE INCREMENTAL BILLS. THAT ARE COMING THE TRIM AROUND THE EDGES TO GIVE THE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS MORE TOOLS. THE GET INDIVIDUALS MEANS AND WAYS TO BEAT THE RAP. WE HAVE A VERY PERFECT AND PERFECTED THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN AMERICA. WRONGFULLY CONVICTED. WE HAVE MANY VENUES FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO SEE JUST REMEDY. IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND THANK GOD SHE DOES BECAUSE THERE ARE ERRORS. BUT NOT NEAR AS MANY AS SOME TALENT RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW FOR A WHILE A FEW YEARS WE WENT THROUGH THIS. TREND OR THE FAD ALL DIMINISH IT EVEN TO CALL IT A FAD. WE WILL GET BACK TO TOUGH ON CRIME. WELL DURING THOSE YEARS OF QUOTE TO TOUGH ON CRIME IN THE MINDS OF SOME. WHERE WE SAY FOR. AARON BUCKLEY UNEQUIVOCALLY ABSOLUTELY. WAS JUSTICE DONE IN THOSE RARE INSTANCES WERE JUSTICE DID NOT OCCUR YOU BET. WE CAN CALL OUT THE INSTANCES. I REGION NO VOTE ON ALMOST ALL OF THESE BILLS LADIES AND GENTLEMAN IT'S TIME TO SAY ENOUGH JUSTICE FOR CONVICTED CRIMINALS AND MORE JUSTICE FOR A LAW ABIDING SIX CITIZENS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES. SENATOR KAMLAGER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I AM RISE AND URGENT I VOTE ON S. B. FOUR SIX SEVEN I WASN'T REALLY PLANNING TO SAY ANYTHING BUT- AFTER LISTENING TO SOME OF THE COMMON SPELLED- COMPELLED- YOU KNOW. OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IS NOT PERFECT. B. IT IS INCREDIBLY FLAWED BECAUSE OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED AND IS RUN BY PEOPLE. AND PEOPLE ARE FLAWED AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY NOT TO TURN AROUND THE EDGES BUT TO REALLY INJECT. SOME FAIRNESS- AN OBJECTIVE THINKING ABOUT TESTIMONY AND ABOUT INFORMATION THAT IS SHARED WITH JURORS DURING TRIALS AND HOW THAT INFORMATION IS SHARED AND OFTEN TIMES IT IS SHARED BY FOLKS WHO ARE LOOSELY TERMED EXPERTS THIS BILL IS A NOT IT IS NOT ABOUT CRIMES THE BILL IS NOT ABOUT CRIMINALS IT IS NOT ABOUT PEOPLE DOING STUFF THAT'S BAD. IT'S ABOUT PROCESS AND IT'S ABOUT TESTIMONY. AND SO MANY FOLKS CAN FIND THEIR WAY. INTO A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JURY WITH THAT TITLE EXPERT. LAUDING SOME KIND OF INFORMATION THAT IS FLAWED THAT IS SUBJECTIVE. AND THAT IS HARD TO VERIFY. BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN YOU COME BEFORE A JURY JURORS. WITH PARTICULAR TITLES. WHEN IT COMES A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE PRESENTING. AND WHEN YOU'RE DISCUSSING WHETHER OR NOT TO SEND SOMEONE SOMEONE AWAY. FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME OR FOR LIFE MAKE SURE THAT THE FOLKS WHO ARE TESTIFYING IN PROVIDING INFORMATION ARE PROVIDING ACCURATE VERIFIABLE. INFORMATION BECAUSE ULTIMATELY YOU ARE DECIDING IF SOMEONE IS GOING TO GO AWAY FOR LIFE. VERY LONG TIME OR NOT. THAT IS WHAT THIS BLL SAYS AND ONCE AGAIN I JUST IMPLORE US TO CONSIDER THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. AND IT IS A BATTLE BETWEEN SIDES OFFERING INFORMATION AND NARRATIVE. ABOUT. YOU SHOULD REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THE INFORMATION THAT YOU ARE PRESENTING IS TRUE. AND IS NOT CLOUDED BY TITLES AND FALSE INFORMATION THAT IS NOT WHAT WE WANT OUR COURTS TO REPRESENT SO WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AS BEFORE SIX SEVEN. SENATOR BRIDGES. THIS IS AN INTERESTING ISSUE. THE COUPLE OF POPULAR COMMENTS. THE BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME. THAT EVEN A HAM SANDWICH COULD BE INDICTED. AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN EXPERT TO SERVE AS AN EXPERT WITNESS. SKY'S THE LIMIT YOU CAN GET ANYBODY TO SAY VIRTUALLY ANYTHING. IT IS ACTUALLY TRUE THE SYSTEM IS PRONE TO BUY AN OPINION- TYPE OF SCENARIO WE'VE SEEN IT WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. BUT I THINK WE ALSO HAVE A FLIP SIDE OF THIS COIN I THINK THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO REMEDY SOMETHING IS MERITORIOUS. IS THAT WE WANT TO BRING. A GREATER SCRUTINY GREATER CREDENTIALS GREATER QUALIFICATIONS IN THE ASSESSMENT OF ALL THAT THAT GOES INTO WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE SHOULD BE DEEMED AN EXPERT. I WOULD CAUTION MY COLLEAGUES HOWEVER THAT THERE COULD BE A SERIOUS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE HERE. AND THAT WOULD BE THE CREATION OF COTTAGE INDUSTRY. TO ABSOLUTELY CREATE COUNTER SCIENCE DELIBERATELY TODAY WHEN YOU DO HAVE SOMEBODY OUR WHO IS PRESENTING ON MATERIAL BASED ON SCIENCE OR DATA THAT THERE IS A BODY OF SCHOLARSHIP OUT THERE THAT CAN BE USED PRECISELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF. UNDERMINING IT. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT FRANKLY COULD BE AS DANGEROUS IT'S THE SITUATION WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING ON THIS THIS IS A- THIS PROJECT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. BUT I DON'T SEE HOW IT'S GOING TO RESOLVE WHAT IS INHERENTLY UNRESOLVABLE WHICH IS THE JURY OR THE JUDGE HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE THE WEIGHT. AN EXPERT OPINION HAS ON THE BEARING AN OUTCOME OF THE CASE. THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF OUR SYSTEM. SAME WAY IT IS WITH SOMEONE WHO IS A PROPOSED WITNESS. THEY WEIGHED THE MERITS AND IN CIRCUMSTANCES OF THAT OPINION OR THAT OBSERVATION. I DON'T THINK THERE'S A WAY OUT OF IT- RUSSIAN REGRETFULLY I'M GONNA HAVE TO- NOT SUPPORT THIS TODAY BUT I THINK WHAT HE'S TRYING WITH WITH THE OTHERS TRYING TO DO HAS MERIT. BUT I THINK THAT THERE IS A MORE NATURAL WAY THAT IT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THAT WOULD BE A SET OF EXPECTATIONS AND PROTOCOLS PROBABLY BETTER VETTED THROUGH. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND OTHER AGENCIES AND INSTRUMENTS- WITHIN- WITHIN THE PRACTICE OF LAW INCLUDING THE BEER THE BAR ASSOCIATIONS ON WHAT ARE CONSIDERED. ACCEPTABLE CREDENTIALS BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN THAT- WHEN PEOPLE PRESENT THEMSELVES AS EXPERTS OFTENTIMES THEY ARE EXPERTS FOR HIRE. SENATOR A. THANK YOU AMEND PRESIDENTIAL- I ONCE KNEW A PROSECUTOR WHO ULTIMATELY BECAME A DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN IS PRO LIFE SERVED ACTUALLY IN THIS LEGISLATURE IN ANOTHER CHAMBER. WHO WAS OVERHEARD SAYING ONCE ANY MEDIOCRE PROSECUTOR CAN CONVERT CONVICTED INDIVIDUAL WHO IS GUILTY. IT TAKES A GREAT PROSECUTOR TO CONVICT SOMEONE WHO IS NOT. AND THIS MEASURES SIMPLY PUTS. EXPERT WITNESS TESTIMONY ON THE SAME FOOTING IS TESTIMONY OF PERCIPIENT FACT BASED WITNESSES WHO TESTIFY IN TRIAL. AND WE'RE THERE ARE DEFECTS IN THAT TESTIMONY OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER. WHETHER IT'S A FACT WITNESS OR AN EXPERT WITNESS DEFECTS THAT ARE DISCOVERED POST TRIAL. THAT THE CASE IS REVIEWED. BY A COURT. AND IN APPROPRIATE CASES JUSTICE IS DONE. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS PROCESS IS ALL ABOUT. IT'S NOT PROSECUTING THOSE IN CONVICTING THOSE WHO ARE NOT GUILTY. WHERE THERE ARE PROSECUTING THOSE WHERE THERE IS SOME QUESTION AND DOING THINGS IN IN PRESENTING TESTIMONY TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE CONVICTED EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT BE. IT IS MAKING SURE THAT THE PROCESS IS FAIR. AND THE JUSTICES STYLE. AND IF EXPERT TESTIMONY IS LATER DISCOVERED TO BE BASED ON FLAWED SCIENCE. TESTIMONY THAT IS INACCURATE DELIBERATELY SO OR PERHAPS NOT. THE COURT HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THOSE CASES TO MAKE SURE THAT INNOCENT PEOPLE. CONTRARY TO MY PROSECUTOR FRIEND ARE NOT CONVICTED I SUGGEST AN AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SAYING NINE SENATOR WIENER YOU MAKING. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT BECAUSE I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL- ACTIVITY ON THIS BILL HERE WE HAVE A LOT OF FIGHTS- ON THE SENATE FLOOR IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE- ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE ON BILLS ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE A CRIME OR NOT A CRIME. WHY SHOULD THE SENTENCE BE- AND SO ON AND SO FORTH AND THOSE WE HAVE A LOT OF PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES AND WE HAVE THOSE FIGHTS WE TAKE THOSE VOTES AND SOMETIMES AS MEASURES PASS AND THEN THEY DON'T. HI THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE FIGHTS AND THAT THERE'S A REASON WHY THIS BILL. LITERALLY RECEIVED UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. IN BOTH OF THE COMMITTEES THAT WAS HEARD IN. THIS BILL LITERALLY HAS NO OPPOSITION. NOT THE TA IS NOT ANY OF THOSE LAW ENFORCEMENT OF NOTHING NO OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. BECAUSE THIS IS A BILL WHOSE TIME HAS COME. IN THIS BILL IT WOULD BE CLEAR THOSE TWO THINGS. IT GIVES JUDGES STRONGER TOOLS TAKE TO PREVENT JUNK SCIENCE FROM COMING INTO OUR COURTROOMS. I LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE AND LIKE OUR COLLEAGUE MARIN COUNTY WHO IS- STILL- DOING LAWYER WORK- AS WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO BOTH BUT OUR GOD BLESS YOU- BUT I MIGHT HAVE A SLIGHT BEFORE I WAS IN ELECTED OFFICE I SPENT FIFTEEN YEARS AS- AS A ATTORNEY AS A LITIGATOR I DID JURY TRIALS. ON AND I'LL TELL YOU AND ANYONE WHO IS PRACTICE AND ON TRIALS WILL KNOW THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN SOMEONE PUTSAN EXPERT ON THE STAND AND YOU SAID YOURSELF HELL ON EARTH. IS THIS PERSON TESTIFYING. HELL ON EARTH I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS PERSON IS FACING A POWERFUL OPINIONS BECAUSE THE JURY'S JUST REALLY MOST OF IT HERE THE BOTTOM LINE OPINION IT'S SO POWERFUL. AND YOU REALIZE THAT IS BASED TRULY ON JUNK. AND SOMETIMES IT'S BECAUSE- FIFTY YEARS AGO. THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEAL. DECIDED THAT ACCESS KIND OF ACTS FOR WITNESSING WAS APPROPRIATE. AND EVEN THOUGH THERE'S BEEN ENORMOUS SCIENCES SINCE AND THAT HAS SHOWN. THAT IT IS REALLY DUBIOUS COURTS JUST KEEP LETTING IT AND LETTING IT END. BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED YEARS AGO WE'VE SEEN THIS WITH. MICRO HAIR ANALYSIS RECEITA WITH FINGERPRINTING ANALYSIS THAT OVER TIME NEW SCIENCE COMES OUT. AND YET THESE THIS TESTIMONY JUST KEEPS COMING IN. AND THIS SIMPLY STRENGTHENS THE GUARD RAILS. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT KIND OF JUNK SCIENCE WERE REALLY DEEPLY DISPUTED SCIENCE DOES NOT OVERWHELM. ON A JURY. AND TO BE CLEAR. WHAT THIS ISN'T ABOUT WHETHER RELATING CRIMINALS GET OUT OF JAIL FREE. THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT IF WE CAN PICK SOMEONE IT'S ACTUALLY THE PERSON WHO DID IT THE ONE INNOCENT PERSON GOES TO JAIL. NOT ONLY DOES NOT DESTROY THE LIFE OF THAT INDIVIDUAL AND THEIR FAMILY HOW IS THAT FAIR TO THE VICTIM. THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY COMMITTED THE CRIME IS NOT THE ONE WHO WENT TO JAIL THAT DOESN'T HELP THE VICTIMS THAT'S IT INSULT. TO THE VICTIM. SO THE WE NEED TO REALLY FOCUS THAT THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AND IF SOMEONE GETS HIDEOUS CORPUS BECAUSE OF THIS AND- CONVICTIONS OVERTURNED BECAUSE IT WAS BASED ON JUNK SCIENCE. THEY'RE NOT AUTOMATICALLY FREE THEY'RE GONNA GET RETRIED. AND THE PROSECUTION WILL HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL DO IT THE RIGHT WAY AND IF I CAN'T DO IT THE RIGHT WAY.

GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON VETR PRESIDENT- SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL IT HAS TO DO WITH SCHOOL FUNDING- THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS HAD A MASSIVE IMPACT ON EVERY FACET OF OUR LIVES AND SPECIAL EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THE LAST TWO YEARS OUR SCHOOLS THE PIVOTED FROM VIRTUAL LEARNING TO HYBRID LEARNING THEIR FACES SHIFTING BUFFET SITTING ROMAN STOPPING SHORTAGES I KNOW THAT MY DISTRICT MANY OF MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF. CONCERNS THAT ENROLLMENT WILL CONTINUE TO SHIP. PREDICTABLE WASTE. IMPACTING THEIR FUNDING EVEN AS THEY RESPOND TO INCREASE STUDENT NEEDS. I KNOW THAT OUR COLLEAGUE. FROM MY CAN YOU HAD A HAS A BILL GOING TO READ SHIFT THE ENTIRE. WAY THAT WE FINANCE OUR SCHOOLS BUT IN THE MEANTIME. ARE WE HAVE AN ISSUE. WE'VE SEEN ENORMOUS VOLATILITY ENROLLMENT. IN THIS BILL WOULD HELP TO CREATE SOME STABILITY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE FACED WITH- WITH WITH WITH THAT WITH A GREAT DEAL OF ONE OF NORTH. SO THE BILL FREE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ABA FOR TO SHOW YEAR AS WE CONTINUE BROADER DISCUSSIONS ON WHAT SCHOOL FUNDING LOOKS LIKE IN THE FUTURE. PROVIDING THIS MUCH NEEDED CERTAINTY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS THEY PLAN THEIR SPENDING THEIR STAFFING THEIR PROGRAMS AHEAD OF THE BOT BUDGET ADOPTION I SERVED ON MY LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD. I DURING THAT THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT DOWNTURN IT WAS IT A TERRIBLE YOU KNOW VERY DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE THEY'RE GOING THROUGH. SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH MUCH WORSE BECAUSE OF ALL THE- ALL THE POLITICS ALL THE OTHER COULD BE ISSUES BUT ALSO THE IN MARIN ROMAN VOLATILITY. OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEED THIS MEMBERS- I- YEAH MA'AM IT'S AN APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE SURE THE SUPPLIES THE CURRENT YEAR FUNDING AS WELL. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. MA'AM IS THERE ANY.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS- I SAW THIS BILL AND- EDUCATION AND I HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR IF I MAY WOULD YOU ACCEPT A QUESTION CENTER ALLEN YES OF COURSE HE WILL. EVEN PRESENTED ALI. THANK YOU BUT YOU KNOW. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD WORD OUR THIRD YEAR NOW THAT- I THINK IT'S THIRD YEAR THAT WE'VE JUST. BASICALLY TAKEN EIGHTY EIGHT THAT WAS AVAILABLE AT THE TIME- PRE COATED IN AND KEPT THAT. TOWARDS OUT BUT QUITE FRANKLY. WELL THAT'S A REWARDING STE WALDRON PENALIZING OTHERS AND MANY OF THE- REASONS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE EXITED. THE WE OF LOWER AND RIGHT IS BECAUSE POLICIES NEEDED OUT OF THE SCHOOL BOARD OR OR- OR A AREAS WERE. TWENTY TO TAKE THEIR KIDS AND THAT THOSE REPORTS DONE THROUGH CODE IN SO HERE WE ARE IN THE THIRD YEAR AND SOME OF THOSE SCHOOLS SOME PEOPLE MOVE THEIR KIDS SAYS SCHOOLS WERE OPEN OR FOR VARIOUS REASONS TRY TO ACCESS TO SCHOOLS TO GO TO CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE PLACES WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET. A SERVICE SO CONTINUE TO JUST- BLAKE IN THE FUN SCHOOLS THE SCHOOL'S ATHLETIC KIDS QUITE FRANKLY- AND WE HAVE INFUSED A LOT OF RESOURCES BUT THE SCHOOLS THAT AT GREW UP QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE THE POLICIES THAT THE THEY'RE GETTING PENALIZED BECAUSE THEY'RE EIGHTY IS ACTUALLY. YEAH AT WHERE WE WERE BEFORE SO WHAT WE DO YOU INTEND TO DO TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. WELL SENATOR REID THROUGH THROUGH THE PRESIDENT- WE ACTUALLY HAVE ADDRESS THAT CONCERN THE CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE. ALSO WE'VE APPLIED OUR THE LEGISLATION TO THEM AND TO THE CURRENT YEAR- ANOTHER SEE THERE'S MORE MONEY IN THE SYSTEM FOR EVERYONE THANKFULLY- BUT IN THE END OF THE DAY WE RECOGNIZE SO ALL THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE TAKING IN MORE STUDENTS FOR WHATEVER. REASON WE'LL WE'LL GET MORE MONEY ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE NEW STUDENTS. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TOTALLY UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION. OUT WE WANT TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE. STRUGGLING TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS ARE GIVEN ALL THE ROAD VOLATILITY SO. IT ONLY STANDS A FOR ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR WE KNOW HOW UNPRECEDENTED THIS MOMENT IS. I JUST THINK THAT THE- I JUST THINK THAT THE MOMENT REALLY CALLS FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS- YOUR FOR YOUR P. COULD I REMEMBER OUR OUR DIALOGUE IN IN IN IN COMMITTEE. SENATOR AND WE GOT WE GOT THAT THAT ISSUE ADDRESSED. IN APPROPRIATIONS IMMENSE- BUT BUT BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY SPEAKING. HI THIS IS JUST ABOUT ENSURING THAT DURING THIS UNPRECEDENTED MOMENT ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ABLE TO. HIDE HERE TO KEEP THEIR BUDGETS BALANCED. AND KEEP YOUR LIGHTS ON KEEP THEIR- KEEP THEIR THEIR THEIR OPERATIONS GOING. UNTIL WE HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHERE. OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO EMERGE BUT AS WE DISCUSSED AND EDUCATION COMMITTEE I THINK THE COMMITTEE NEED TO TAKE UP. THE BROADER QUESTION OF THE OF WHERE WE'RE GOING POST COVETED IN ROMANCE AT. SCHOOL FINANCING OF THOSE ARE ALL BIG QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN IN THE COMEDIAN AND THE SUB AND- BUT ALL THIS BILL DOES IS THIS KEEP KEEP. KEEP THEM HOLE FOR AN ADDITIONAL YEAR GIVEN ALL OF THE- VOLATILITY. I THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMENT. I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT. REDUCE ANALYSIS ON WHERE THESE KIDS ARE GOING AND WHY THE PARENTS ARE CHOOSING- TO TRY TO GET THEIR KIDS EDUCATED IN DIFFERENT PLACES THAN WHERE THEY HAVE THEY HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY AND YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE TAKING GREAT STRIDES TO. A PENALIZED SAID CHARTER SCHOOLS OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND I THINK- AT LEAST IN MY DISTRICT AND- PROVOKES I'M HEARING- ACROSS THE STATE THAT. THEY WANT SOME MORE OPTIONS AND THEY WANT THEIR MONEY TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOLS THAT THEY CHOOSE- IN IN THIS BASICALLY IS CONTINUE TO KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD AND ALLOW SCHOOLS TO. CONTINUE TO GET FIND. OUT WHEN THEIR STUDENTS AREN'T THERE AND SO WE NEED TO THOSE ISSUES BUT NOT FOR. AND NOT. WE MAY BE IN THE PANDEMIC FOR SOME LONGER BUT BUT THE OVER ISSUE IS WHY OUR KIDS ARE. AND WHY ARE PARENTS CHOOSING OTHER OPTIONS AND THE MONEY'S NOT ON THOSE KIDS WETHERBY CHARTERS OR WHATEVER- ABILITY THEY WANT PARENTS WANT TO HAVE A FOR THEIR TAX DOLLARS TO GO OVER THEIR KIDS ARE GOING.
