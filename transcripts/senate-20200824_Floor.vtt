THESE CASES ON BEHALF OF

WORKERS. THIS IS NOT A BILL

00:31:24.749 --> 00:31:25.683
THAT IS INTENDED TO INCREASE

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:27.619
LITIGATION AS THE OPPOSITION

00:31:27.685 --> 00:31:31.022

RECOURSE WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN

00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:40.632
UNFAIRLY RETALIATED. AGAINST

00:31:40.698 --> 00:31:41.266
FOR INVOKING THEIR RIGHTS UNDER

00:31:41.332 --> 00:31:42.800
THE LAW. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

00:31:42.867 --> 00:31:44.402
AND I'VE- THANK YOU CENTRAL WE

00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:44.969
HAVE JUST OR DEBATE ON THE

00:31:45.036 --> 00:31:46.104
FLOOR WE'RE GONNA START OFF

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:47.272
WITH CENTER BRIDGES GOOD

00:31:47.338 --> 00:31:48.873
AFTERNOON CENTER. BUT RISK

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.643
PRESIDENT. WHEN THIS MATTER

00:31:51.709 --> 00:31:53.077
CAME BEFORE JUDICIARY. I ASKED

00:31:53.144 --> 00:31:54.312
SOME QUESTIONS. IN MY

00:31:54.379 --> 00:31:55.680
UNDERSTANDING THE BILL HASN'T

00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:57.849
CHANGED ALL THAT MUCH. BUT ONE

00:31:57.915 --> 00:31:59.450
OF THE CONCERNS I HAD IS THAT

00:31:59.517 --> 00:32:04.222
WHEN A PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO

00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:07.225
ATTORNEY'S FEES IF THEY WIN.

00:32:07.292 --> 00:32:09.427
CONVERSELY WHAT A DEFENDANT BE

00:32:09.494 --> 00:32:11.029
ABLE TO COLLECT ATTORNEYS FEES

00:32:11.095 --> 00:32:12.797
IF THEY WIN MY UNDERSTANDING

00:32:12.864 --> 00:32:14.532
THE ANSWER'S NO. THE OTHER

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:17.769
THING IS. I BELIEVE THIS

00:32:17.835 --> 00:32:19.570
PROBABLY WILL INCENTIVIZE

00:32:19.637 --> 00:32:21.739
LAWSUITS BECAUSE MY

00:32:21.806 --> 00:32:23.441
UNDERSTANDING BASED ALSO ON THE

00:32:23.508 --> 00:32:26.377
JUDICIARY DISCUSSION. IS THAT

00:32:26.444 --> 00:32:28.279
MANY OF THESE CAN BE RESOLVED

00:32:28.346 --> 00:32:30.415
OUT OF THE COMMISSION FOR OUT

00:32:30.481 --> 00:32:36.788
OF COURT AND WHEN THAT.

00:32:36.854 --> 00:32:38.289
APPRECIATING THIS AS A VOLUME

00:32:38.356 --> 00:32:40.425
APPROACH TO COLLECTING

00:32:40.491 --> 00:32:42.460
INDIVIDUALS TO FILE LAWSUITS IN

00:32:42.527 --> 00:32:44.429
THE PLAINTIFF OR DEFENDANT

00:32:44.495 --> 00:32:46.464
RATHER WILL BE INCENTIVIZED TO

00:32:46.531 --> 00:32:47.765
SETTLE THESE THINGS OUT OF

00:32:47.832 --> 00:32:49.233
COURT BECAUSE JUST THE SHEER

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.135
COST OF LITIGATION SO I THINK

00:32:51.202 --> 00:32:52.503
THIS WILL ACTUALLY IT SOUNDS

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:54.005
LIKE IT'S FAIR BECAUSE YOU DO

00:32:54.072 --> 00:32:55.873
HAVE INDIVIDUALS. WHO DON'T

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.809
HAVE THE FINANCIAL WHERE WITH

00:32:57.875 --> 00:32:59.744
ALL TO HIGHER INTEREST ON TO

00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:01.346
WORK TO BE ABLE TO ADVOCATE ON

00:33:01.412 --> 00:33:04.482
THEIR OWN BEHALF THAT THEY MUST

00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:05.750
HIRE AN ATTORNEY. THAT THE

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:07.051
ADVANTAGE IN THE LEVERAGED TO

00:33:07.118 --> 00:33:08.486
BE WITH THE DEFENDANT WHICH IS

00:33:08.553 --> 00:33:10.755
THE CORPORATION. BUT IF WE'RE

00:33:10.822 --> 00:33:12.857
GOING TO BE FAIR I THINK THAT

00:33:12.924 --> 00:33:15.059
WE SHOULD ALSO ALLOW FOR THOSE

00:33:15.126 --> 00:33:16.227
DEFENDANTS WHO HAVE

00:33:16.294 --> 00:33:17.762
DEMONSTRATED THAT THAT WOULD BE

00:33:17.829 --> 00:33:19.764
A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT THAT THE TO

00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:21.699
BE ENTITLED TO THEIR ATTORNEYS

00:33:21.766 --> 00:33:24.001
FEES. AND I THINK THAT IS A

00:33:24.068 --> 00:33:25.737
CHALLENGE NO DOUBT MY ESTEEMED

00:33:25.803 --> 00:33:27.538
COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA IS

00:33:27.605 --> 00:33:28.840
GOING TO STAND UP RIGHT NOW

00:33:28.906 --> 00:33:31.376
POSSIBLY EVEN HER ANOTHER. IF

00:33:31.442 --> 00:33:32.844
COLLEAGUES BUT I THINK THIS IS

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:34.545
THE DISCUSSION WE DON'T HAVE

00:33:34.612 --> 00:33:36.314
THE BRITISH RULE SYSTEM IN THE

00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:37.915
US I UNDERSTAND THAT WHICH

00:33:37.982 --> 00:33:39.484
WOULD OTHERWISE ENTITLE THE

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:40.518
PREVAILING PARTY TO COLLECT

00:33:40.585 --> 00:33:42.987
ATTORNEYS FEES. BUT IF WE THINK

00:33:43.054 --> 00:33:44.956
THAT THIS IS NOT INCENTIVIZE

00:33:45.022 --> 00:33:46.891
LAWSUITS IN ALSO SETTLEMENTS

00:33:46.958 --> 00:33:50.294
WILL BE SORELY MISTAKEN. THANK

00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:52.130
YOU SO MUCH CENTER GORGEOUS- I

00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:53.164
KNOW CENTER LATER YOU'LL TAKE

00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:54.999
THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES I'M SURE

00:33:55.066 --> 00:33:56.501
WE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEE IF

00:33:56.567 --> 00:33:57.468
THERE'S ANY OTHER DAY DIGITAL

00:33:57.535 --> 00:33:58.603
DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE

00:33:58.669 --> 00:34:01.339
FLOOR. GOOD AFTERNOON CENTER

00:34:01.406 --> 00:34:03.374
JACKSON. YES I KNOW IT'S HARD

00:34:03.441 --> 00:34:05.476
TO SEE BEHIND THE PLEXIGLAS YOU

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:06.310
HAVE NO IDEA HOW HARD IT IS TO

00:34:06.377 --> 00:34:08.212
HEAR. THE PLEXIGLASS BUT I DID

00:34:08.279 --> 00:34:11.315
HEAR THAT- LAST UP. ARGUMENTUM

00:34:11.382 --> 00:34:13.418
WE DID HAVE THIS DISCUSSION. IN

00:34:13.484 --> 00:34:15.119
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. THE

00:34:15.186 --> 00:34:16.387
UNITED STATES OPERATES ON THE

00:34:16.454 --> 00:34:18.589
AMERICAN SYSTEM. AND THAT IS A

00:34:18.656 --> 00:34:20.925
SYSTEM WHERE. WHEN YOU HAVE

00:34:20.992 --> 00:34:23.828
RELATIVELY UNEQUAL BALANCE IN A

00:34:23.895 --> 00:34:26.431
DEBATE IN A DISPUTE. THE

00:34:26.497 --> 00:34:28.933
PLAINTIFF IF THEY PREVAIL. IS

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.668
ENTITLED TO ATTORNEY'S FEES.

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:33.838
HOWEVER THE COURT ALWAYS HAS

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:35.072
DISCRETION. AND I THINK THAT'S

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:36.841
IMPORTANT WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT

00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:39.210
FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT. I OFTEN SAY

00:34:39.277 --> 00:34:42.847
THAT. THE MANTRA THE MEME IS

00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:44.015
EVERY LAWSUIT AS A FRIVOLOUS

00:34:44.081 --> 00:34:46.017
LAWSUIT AND EVERY LAWYER IS A

00:34:46.083 --> 00:34:48.085
GREEDY TRIAL LAWYERS. BUT THAT

00:34:48.152 --> 00:34:50.087
ISN'T THE CASE AND THIS IS JUST

00:34:50.154 --> 00:34:54.158
A FALSE AND INACCURATE- A

00:34:54.225 --> 00:34:56.627
MESSAGING- BECAUSE THE COURTS

00:34:56.694 --> 00:34:58.863
ALWAYS HAVE THE AUTHORITY. TO

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:02.133
EITHER REDUCE OR DENY REQUESTS

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.935
FOR ATTORNEYS FEES. AND IN THIS

00:35:04.001 --> 00:35:06.204
PARTICULAR SITUATION IF THE

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:07.972
LAWSUIT IS DEEMED FRIVOLOUS BY

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:09.841
THE COURT THEN ATTORNEYS FEES

00:35:09.907 --> 00:35:12.210
ACTUALLY CAN BE GIVEN TO THE

00:35:12.276 --> 00:35:13.811
DEFENDANT AS THE PREVAILING

00:35:13.878 --> 00:35:18.049
PARTY SO I REALLY HOPE. THAT AS

00:35:18.115 --> 00:35:20.117
WE PROCEED WE RECOGNIZE. THAT

00:35:20.184 --> 00:35:22.253
SO MUCH OF THIS IS JUST FALSE

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.155
PROPAGANDA. THE COURT REALLY

00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:26.557
HAS THE DISCRETION YOU WILL NOT

00:35:26.624 --> 00:35:29.360
SEE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS BECAUSE

00:35:29.427 --> 00:35:31.229
THE PARTY BRINGING THEM IS

00:35:31.295 --> 00:35:33.631
SUBJECT TO A ESSENTIALLY

00:35:33.698 --> 00:35:35.233
PUNITIVE ACT MEANING THAT THEY

00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:38.669
END UP HAVING TO PAY THE COST.

00:35:38.736 --> 00:35:40.838
OF THIS IS A SITUATION. WE'RE

00:35:40.905 --> 00:35:42.640
WHICH IS TRYING TO BALANCE OUT.

00:35:42.707 --> 00:35:45.309
BETWEEN A WORKER WHO IS THE

00:35:45.376 --> 00:35:48.012
SUBJECT OF RETALIATION FOR

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:49.013
DOING SO. THAT THEY ARE

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.716
LAWFULLY ENTITLED TO DO BY AN

00:35:51.782 --> 00:36:01.959
EMPLOYER WHO IS. A TRY TO IN

00:36:02.026 --> 00:36:04.295
THAT RIGHT SUPPRESSANT INTO

00:36:04.362 --> 00:36:04.795
AGAINST IT AND IT IS THE

00:36:04.862 --> 00:36:06.230
WORKERS RIGHT TO BRING IN A- OR

00:36:06.297 --> 00:36:10.001
TO RECOGNIZE. I SHOULD SAY UP

00:36:10.067 --> 00:36:11.569
WIN A RAW HAS BEEN COMMITTED

00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:12.970
AGAINST THEM- UNDEREMPLOYMENT

00:36:13.037 --> 00:36:15.339
LOS AND WHEN THE RETALIATED

00:36:15.406 --> 00:36:17.475
AGAINST THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO

00:36:17.542 --> 00:36:20.878
BRING INACTION IN THAT REGARD

00:36:20.945 --> 00:36:23.314
THE WHOLE POINT IS TO. IS TO

00:36:23.381 --> 00:36:25.283
DISCOURAGE THAT KIND OF MISUSE

00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:28.152
OF POWER THAT THE EMPLOYER HAS

00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:29.954
THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES WE

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:31.222
HAD AN INTERESTING DISCUSSION

00:36:31.289 --> 00:36:32.490
AS WE ALWAYS DO WITH THE GOOD

00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:36.027
SENATOR FROM. FRESNO IS

00:36:36.093 --> 00:36:39.564
OFFICIAL. YES FROM FRESNO BUT

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.098
IT IS A VERY DIFFERENT WAY OF

00:36:41.165 --> 00:36:42.099
LOOKING AT THINGS AND I WOULD

00:36:42.166 --> 00:36:43.868
SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THERE IS A

00:36:43.935 --> 00:36:45.570
REASON FOR THE AMERICAN SYSTEM

00:36:45.636 --> 00:36:47.204
AND THIS I IT AND THANK

00:36:47.271 --> 00:36:47.939
GOODNESS WE DON'T HAVE THE

00:36:48.005 --> 00:36:49.941
BRITISH SYSTEM. BECAUSE I CAN'T

00:36:50.007 --> 00:36:51.976
IMAGINE AS A LAWYER HAVING TO

00:36:52.043 --> 00:36:55.279
PUT ON A- ROBE IN A WHITE WEEK

00:36:55.346 --> 00:36:57.615
SO AMONG OTHER REASONS THIS IS

00:36:57.682 --> 00:36:58.816
A GOOD BILL AND I WOULD

00:36:58.883 --> 00:37:02.620

FROM SANTA BARBARA WAS FORMER

00:37:18.502 --> 00:37:19.770
ELOQUENT IN HER LEGAL

HAVE A CHURCH FOR INSTANCE THAT

02:06:03.789 --> 02:06:05.524
WE JUST PASSED A BILL. AND THEY

02:06:05.591 --> 02:06:06.692
WANT TO BUILD HOUSING ON THEIR

02:06:06.759 --> 02:06:08.494

FAITH COMMUNITY WILL GENERALLY

02:06:12.998 --> 02:06:14.600
DO THAT. SO THAT WE CAN GET

02:06:14.667 --> 02:06:16.001
PEOPLE NOT JUST IN HOUSING TO

02:06:16.068 --> 02:06:17.436
GET THEM WELL ON THEIR WAY TO A

02:06:17.503 --> 02:06:20.039
SUCCESSFUL LIFE- THIS WILL

02:06:20.105 --> 02:06:21.307
AFFECT THE CHURCH FACILITIES

02:06:21.373 --> 02:06:22.975
THAT ON A BILL THAT WE JUST

02:06:23.042 --> 02:06:24.410
PASSED TO ALLOW CHURCHES TO BE

02:06:24.476 --> 02:06:25.945

02:06:26.011 --> 02:06:27.846
POPULATIONS OR BUILD HOUSING

02:06:27.913 --> 02:06:32.084
FOR HOMELESS. I JUST THINK

AGAIN AS WE LOOK AT THE CO

02:06:33.252 --> 02:06:34.586

BUILD UP AGAIN THIS BILL I KNOW

02:06:41.627 --> 02:06:42.294
IT'S NOT JUST FOR BUILDING

02:06:42.361 --> 02:06:43.462
HOUSING BUT I'M JUST FOCUSING

02:06:43.529 --> 02:06:44.596
ON THAT BECAUSE THE LAST FEW

02:06:44.663 --> 02:06:46.298
BILLS THAT WE JUST PASSED. I

02:06:46.365 --> 02:06:47.533
JUST THINK THAT WE NOT NEED TO

02:06:47.599 --> 02:06:48.400
RESTRICT BUSINESS FROM BEING

02:06:48.467 --> 02:06:50.669
ABLE TO. GARNER SUBSIDIES TO DO

02:06:50.736 --> 02:06:52.004

SURE THAT- WE HAVE THE ABILITY

02:06:54.006 --> 02:06:57.443
TO AGAIN HOUSE HOMELESS. AND I

02:06:57.509 --> 02:06:59.411
