SB SIX IT WOULD BE RESET HONOR SB SEVEN HUNDRED IS THAT IT WE ARE ALL RIGHT THANK. YOU VERY MUCH ON FIVE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS- SB SEVEN HUNDRED IS TO ENSURE MISCLASSIFIED POOR DRIVERS HAVE ACCESS TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS THEY ARE ENTITLED TO- AS A LABOR LEADER I SAW FIRST HAND THE IMPORTANCE OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS TO FAMILIES WHEN A PARENT LOST THEIR JOB IT IS OFTEN THE ONLY WAY A FAMILY CAN KEEP THEIR HOME AND KEEP FOOD ON THE TABLE IN HARD TIMES. FOR PORT TRUCK DRIVERS EVEN THIS MODEST PROTECTION HAS BEEN DENIED AS A PANDEMIC HIT THE AMOUNT OF CARGO IN THE PORT TO DROPPED MANY DRIVERS FOUND THEMSELVES OUT OF WORK WHEN THEY APPLIED FOR BENEFITS MANY WERE DENIED EVEN WORSE SOME MISCLASSIFIED DRIVERS WERE DEEMED TO BE EMPLOYERS OF OTHER DRIVERS MAKING THEM LIABLE FOR UNPAID YOU WHITE TAXES INSTEAD OF THE MULTI MILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES PROFITING FROM THEIR WORK. NOW WE KNOW THAT COMPANIES USE ALL KINDS OF ELABORATE SCHEMES TO MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS ESPECIALLY IN POOR DRAINAGE THE LABEL WORKERS AS SEPARATE BUSINESSES LEASE THEM TRUCKS AND TELL THEM TO FIND OTHER WORKERS TO DRIVE BY THE SHIFT ALL OF THIS IS MEANT TO CREATE THE ILLUSION OF INDEPENDENCE WHEN IN REALITY THE WORKERS ARE UNDER THE COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY- IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF STATE AGENCIES TO SEE BEYOND EMPLOYER FRAUD SCHEMES TO PROTECT VULNERABLE WORKERS WHO ARE BEING HARMED. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED HERE DECISIONS DENYING BENEFITS PROLONG SUFFERING AND THE ALSO DELAY ACCOUNTABILITY- FOR THE COOK COMPANIES MOVING GOODS THROUGH THE PORT THE EDT DECISIONS ARE BEING OVERTURNED ON APPEAL BUT WORKERS CANNOT WAIT THEIR VERY SURVIVAL THE ABILITY PUT ROOF ON THEIR HEAD OF FOOD ON THE TABLE DEPENDS ON TIMELY ACCESS TO BENEFITS WHEN WORK DRIES UP- MY BILL DIRECTS THE ADD TO FOLLOW THE LAW IT DIRECTS THEM TO COMPEL TO COMPLY. WITH TWO KEY DECISIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE APPEALS BOARD THAT RIGHTFULLY FOUND DRIVERS TO BE EMPLOYEES AND THE TRUCKING COMPANY NOT A FELLOW WORKER. TO BE THE EMPLOYEE WHO MISSED PAY YOU- I TAXES IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SAY WE BY ASIDE WORKER. THE MATURE THEM THROUGH OUR ACTIONS THAT'S- ENSURE PORT TRUCK DRIVERS GET THEIR FAIR ACCESS TO THE BENEFITS THEY DESERVE. AND COMPANIES THAT. CHEAT WORKERS IN THE STATE ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FIVE TWO WITNESSES TODAY CAITLIN VEGA AND SHINGLES MONTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR A CAITLIN VEGA AND SHANE GUSMAN WHOEVER'S READY TO BEGIN MAY BEGIN. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS INVEGA ON BEHALF OF SUPPORT DIVISION AT THE INTERNATIONAL. INVESTORS HOW COSPONSORED THAT SB SEVEN HUNDRED. SO WHERE HAS THIS CLASSIFICATION OF WORKERS AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND MORE PERVASIVE THAN AT OUR PORT. CORTES THE AGENCIES HAVE CONTINUALLY FOUND THESE WORKERS TO BE EMPLOYEES INCLUDING AN OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY CASES BROUGHT BY THE CALIFORNIA LABOR COMMISSIONER. A USA TODAY EXAMINATION OF CONDITIONS AT THE PORT THAT THAT IT RESEMBLED INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE. THESE ARE THE EXACT EMPLOYEES MOST DESERVING OF PROTECTION FROM OUR STATE AGENCY. UNFORTUNATELY EDT HAS CONTINUED TO DELAY AND DENY DRIVERS APPLICATIONS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE CLEARLY ENTITLED TO THE BENEFITS BASED ON THE LONG SERIES OF DECISIONS FINDING THEM TO BE COMPLETE. EVEN MORE EGREGIOUS THE EDT HAVE PURSUED INDIVIDUAL NOT CLASSIFIED DRIVERS AS THOUGH THEY ARE EMPLOYERS OF ONE ANOTHER RATHER THAN TAKING ACCOUNTABILITY AND UNPAID TAXES FROM THE TRUCKING COMPANIES. WERE ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE. THESE NEAR. CONTINUE BE OVERTURNED BY. LOGIC AND BY THE CALIFORNIA YOU Y. APPEALS BOARD ALL OF WHICH HAVE FOUND THESE DRIVERS TO BE EMPLOYEES AND NOT EMPLOYERS. UNFORTUNATELY THE EDT HAVE YET TO FOLLOW THE LAW AND OUTLINED IN THESE DECISIONS. SB SEVEN HUNDRED A DIFFERENT BOOK DAHLE THAT DIRECT EDT TO COMPLY WITH THE REASONING INTO HAITI WHY APPEAL COURT CASES TO INSURE WORKERS GET THE BENEFITS THEY DESERVE. AND COMPANIES THAT MISCLASSIFIED HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND THEN SHANE GUSMAN MAY BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON XIN GUSTIN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEAMSTERS PUBLIC AFFAIRS COUNCIL AND SUPPORT AND PROUD TO CO SPONSOR THIS BILL. SB SEVEN SEVEN HUNDRED IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT EDT DETERMINATIONS WITH RESPECT TO PORTRAY A DROP DRAYAGE DRIVERS COMPORT WITH THE LAW. UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE A LONG HISTORY OF MIS CLASSIFICATION THE PORT. EDT HAS CONTINUED TO GO AFTER MISCLASSIFIED DRIVERS AS IF THEY ARE EMPLOYEES RATHER THAN EMPLOYERS RATHER THAN EMPLOYEES. EVEN AFTER ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE AFTER ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE HAS HELD THAT DDT HAS IT WRONG AND EVEN AFTER THEIR OWN YOU AYE APPEALS BOARD HELD IN FAVOR OF THESE DRIVERS THEY STILL GO AFTER THEM. THE RESULT IS HE DENIED BENEFITS AND PURSUES MISCLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES FOR BACK PAYROLL TAXES RATHER THAN THEIR EMPLOYERS. THIS IS FINANCIALLY RUINOUS FOR THESE DRIVERS WHO HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED YEARS OF EXPLOITATION FROM PORT TRUCKING COMPANIES IT'S TIME THAT WE STOP HARASSING THESE DRIVERS IN START GOING AFTER SCOFFLAW LAWYERS AT THE LAW ACTUALLY REQUIRES WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF SEVEN HUNDRED.

THAT'S WHY WE'RE A CO SPONSOR OF SB SIX THREE NINE- SENATOR ALSO HAD A BRIEF BUT VERY COMPELLING CASE AFTER WHY CALIFORNIA SHOULD IN THIS EXPLOITATIVE PRACTICE IT LITERALLY D. VALUES THE LABOR OF PEOPLE WITH AUTISM PEOPLE WITH DOWN SYNDROME PEOPLE WITH CEREBRAL PALSY. THIS IS A LABOR ISSUE AND THIS IS A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE I APPRECIATE CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN EXPRESSED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO EACH INDIVIDUAL- WHO'S CURRENTLY IN ONE OF THESE WORKSHOPS IF THE BILL PASSES INTERESTINGLY THIS CONCERN IS OFTEN BEING RAISED BY PROVIDERS AND PEOPLE WHO AREN'T CONCERNED ENOUGH TO PAY MORE THAN TWO DOLLARS AN HOUR IN SOME CASES. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA EXISTS. TO WORK WITH INDIVIDUALS TO FIND THEM THE BEST RIGHT PLACEMENT. IT'S IN PLACE THAT'S THE ROLE NOW AND THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO EACH INDIVIDUAL. THE REALLY GOOD NEWS IS THE GOVERNOR THE LEGISLATURE TOGETHER HAVE PROPOSED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM INCLUDING A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM OUR SERVICE COORDINATORS. THE ADDITIONALLY THE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSED NINE MILLION DOLLARS FOCUSED TO WORK WITH INDIVIDUALS COMING OUT OF THE SHELTERED WORKSHOPS. SO THIS IS THE RIGHT POLICY AT THE RIGHT TIME WITH THE RIGHT SUPPORTS TO MAKE IT SUCCESSFUL PER PEOPLE WHO REALLY DESERVE BETTER THAN WHAT THEY'RE GETTING NOW I'M HAPPY TO MAKE MYSELF AVAILABLE FOR TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS SIMPLY HAVE JACKIE ARMSTRONG ON THE PHONE YOU MAY BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY JACQUI FOR ON THE PHONE. OKAY. HELLO MY NAME IS JACKIE ARMSTRONG AND I WORKED AT A SHELTERED WORKSHOPS FOR SEVEN YEARS- I AM ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM SO IT IT'S NOT.

THAT FULLY ME- I'M NOT SURE WHY THEY WOULD BUT THEY WOULD BOTH ME IN SAYING REALLY NEED THINGS ME AND SO IT MAY ME FEEL AS THOUGH ON. THANK TO A POINT WHERE MY ONLY- INTERACT WITH KEEP WITHOUT THE BILL. OTHER THAN MY FAMILY REPEAT WANT HOW. SO OR PAID MORE THAN ME SO I GOT TO AYE SO SHE PEOPLE WITHOUT THIS BILL AT THE BOTTOM. POSSIBLE POLYSTART CURRENTLY. SO I BECAME A FOR OF P. WITHOUT THIS BILL FOR A LONG IT TO A LONG TO. OVERCOME NOT SHEER- AND- AT ONE POINT I DID FOR THIS BECAUSE OF THE BILLING. BECAUSE THEY PROTECT THE NON. BALI OVER AND I CERTAIN THE STATE. JOBS IN THE COMMUNITY COMPETITORS EMPLOYMENT I WORK IN AN OFFICE NOW AND- IT IS COMPETITIVE SO I HAVE A CHANCE FOR PROMOTION IF I PURSUED THAT. I ALSO AM VERY HAPPY THERE- THAT FEAR THAT I HAD OF PEOPLE WITHOUT DISABILITIES YOU KNOW POSSIBLY BEING A BULLY AND JUST WANTING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME AND MAKE ME CRY ALL THE TIME IS NOT THERE ANYMORE BECAUSE- THERE'S NO ONE LIKE THAT THERE. AND ALSO- THE REASON WHY AND OUT. IS BECAUSE I AM INCREDIBLY VERBAL- I FEEL LIKE I'M SPEAKING FOR THE PEOPLE THAT- SO MAYBE DON'T HAVE THE SAME STRUGGLE TO THOSE THAT ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME THINGS THAT I. MIGHT BE BUT DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO TELL THEIR SERVICE WORKER THEIR PARENTS CAN'T BE BULLIED THEIR- STUFF. SO THANK YOU AND- I. THINK FOR SB. SIX THREE.

YEAH I THINK YOU MAY CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LONDON HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE. SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH I. D. WE ARE A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION OF. COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFITS THAT SERVE THIS PPULATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'M ALSO A PARENT OF A TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD- IN THIS POPULATION AND I'M ALSO A BOARD MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFIT IN SACRAMENTO AND HAVE BEEN FOR TEN YEARS- UNLIKE. CENTER DRAWS A STEVEN THIS ISSUE IS NOT A SIMPLICITY PRESENTS- THE IDEA OF HAVING EVERY PERSON WHO WORKS. THAT HAS A DISABILITY- INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT DISABILITY EARNING MINIMUM WAGE IS A NOBLE IDEA. BUT I JUST HANDED OUT TO YOU- DATA SHEET THAT I WANT TO SHOW YOU. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED A LAW. THAT DECLARED THE TOP HERTIE FOR THIS POPULATION. THE PRIORITY OF FINDING PEOPLE DISABILITIES. EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. HERE WE ARE SEVEN YEARS LATER. WE'RE STILL AT THE EXACT SAME PLACE IN TERMS OF EMPLOYING THIS POPULATION. THIS BILL UNLIKE WITH CENTER DRAWS A SAID THIS BILL DOES NOT GUARANTEE. ANYBODY IN THIS POPULATION THAT THEY DESCRIBE. AS MAKING MINIMUM WAGE WHAT I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL DO. IS WE'LL NOT TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE. TWELVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. WHO CURRENTLY WORK. AND WHO HAVE AN INTELLECTUAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY AND WILL KNOCK HIM OUT OF THEIR JOB. AND LET ME REMIND YOU THAT IN THAT PARTICULAR SYSTEM. THE ONLY WAY YOU GET TO A SUB MINIMUM WAGE JOB WHICH IS LEGAL. THROUGH THE FEDERAL STATUTES. IS BY AS A PERSON WITH AN INTELLECTUAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY. DECLARING THAT THAT'S WHERE YOU'D LIKE TO BE. YOUR REVIEW THE CHOICES YOU'VE DONE THIS WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER. YOU'VE DONE IT WITH COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS. AND THEN YOU SIGN PAPERS AT THE REGIONAL CENTER. THAT EXPRESSED. YOUR CHOICE TO BE IN THAT POSITION. AND THEN YOU REMAIN VERY SIX TO SEE WHERE YOUR PRODUCT LEVEL STANDS IF YOUR PRODUCTIVITY GOES UP YOUR WAGE GOES UP. IF YOU'RE A PERSON WHO CAN COMPETE AT THE FULL LEVEL YOU'LL GET AT LEAST MINIMUM WAGE OR HIGHER AND BY THE WAY. IF YOU WERE A WAREHOUSE WORKER IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND THE WAGE WAS FORTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR BUT ON YOUR PRODUCTIVITY YOU COULD DO A THIRD. YOU WOULD STILL GET FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. SO THE IDEA HERE IS NOT TO EVER PLACE ANYBODY. AT A BELOW MINIMUM WAGE LEVEL WHAT IT IS DESIGNED TO DO IS TO GIVE PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WHO WANNA WORK. A CHANCE TO WORKING GIVEN THE MARKETING COMPETE. THIS BILL NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF MINIMUM WAGE OR HIGHER FOR THAT POPULATION. IT WILL PUT TWELVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIA'S VIçT D. OUT OF WORK. AND WHAT WE WOULD URGE THAT YOU CONSIDER. EVERYTHING IN THIS BILL. AND MOVE IT FORWARD EXCEPT FOR THE TERMINATION DATE OF THE PROGRAM'S. LET THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES DEVELOP THE POLICIES ARE GOING TO DEVELOP. TELL YOU HOW THEY'RE GOING TO FUND IT. IN THE ADMINISTRATION. AND COME BACK TO THAT PROPOSAL WHICH IS CONTAINED IN THE BILL. BUT DON'T KNOCK THESE PEOPLE OUT OF WORK UNNECESSARILY. WITH AN EARLY AND PREMATURE- DATE. THAT CANNOT BE FULFILLED UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT THOSE ANSWERS ARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH AND ON THE PHONE WE ALSO HAVE JOHN BULL. I DO NOT SEE JOHN BUT JOHN IF YOU WERE ON THE LINE YOU MAY PRESS- STAR. ZERO YOU WERE ONLINE FOR STARS.

HI MY NAME IS AMANDA RENDON I'M A PROGRAM COORDINATOR WITH ACHIEVEMENT HOW FORTY AGENCY THAT PROVIDES SERVICES LIKE THE FOURTEEN THE CERTIFICATE TO THOSE WITH DD. AND I- WERE IN OPPOSITION OF LEAST THREE NINE COULD BLOW WHAT LAW FAD- IT ONLY. CHOICES FOR PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE WHILE ALSO A- NOT OF P. OUT OF WORK. IT IS. THE TWO YEAR OUT PLAN WE THINK WE DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH. TO OUR INTRODUCED PROGRAMS ALL WE ARE A LOT WITH THE IDEA THAT SHOULD EARN WAGE. TWO AND A HALF SIMPLY AS ENOUGH TIME TO DEVELOPING PRO CAPTURE. THE THOUSANDS OF IN THE- WHO ARE CURRENTLY. SERVED BY. FEET PRO. THANK YOU THANK YOU. WE'LL TAKE THAT AS THE HUBS SHOWING. AND AN COME TO I DON'T LOSING ELSE THINK ABOUT MONEY. THIS CORRECT THANK YOU FIFTY. I THANK YOU SO MUCH WILL BRING UP. TO THE COMMITTEE. I BELIEVE IT'S AN EMOTIONAL ONES WE HAD ONE RIGHT RIGHT AWAY WE HAD ONE I YES SOME GONZALEZ. I AM SO- SENATOR FOR YOU BRINGING THIS. I AS YOU KNOW THINK WE JUST- MAYBE MY FIRST YEAR EIGHT I A RISE. ON SIMPLY THE GOVERNMENT TO GET RID OF THE PROGRAM. AND DESPITE GET THROUGH THE- AT IMPAIR- ANY ACTIVE HUBER AT. AT OF. INDIVIDUAL JUST IT WOULD BE A THAT DIED THE BIGGEST ON THE SENATE- AND IN WHO TESTED TODAY SO- YOU KNOW PERHAPS THE RESOLUTION WOULD HAVE BEEN A WAY TO START THE PROCESS. EIGHT YEARS AGO- BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE HAVING DISCUSS ABOUT THE LONG OF PRO. WHITE WAS CREE THE OF HUMAN DIGNITY AND WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT HUMAN DIGNITY AND THE FACT THAT IF WE VALUE WORK IN IN AN ECONOMY WHERE WE'RE TOLD THAT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH WORKERS. THAT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH PEOPLE WILLING TO TAKE A MINIMUM WAGE JOB PERHAPS THEN WE SHOULD AT LEAST PAY EVERYBODY MINIMUM WAGE SO I VALUE ANY WORK THAT ANY INDIVIDUAL DOES AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE A MINIMUM WAGE SO THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL. CAN UTILIZE THAT SO THANK YOU FOR DO I THINK THIS IS- A CIVIL RIGHTS AND- ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN NEGLECTED FOR FAR TOO LONG. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENT NO QUESTION. OKAY WELL YES PLEASE. SOME WHEN I LOOK THROUGH- THE BILL UNDER THE THAT IS I TO FELT THAT THE WAS SOMETHING THAT- WAS LONG OVER. BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THE ARE LISTENING TO THE TEST OF MISTER LONDON I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. THE FACT THAT HE HAS THIS HISTORY. IT ISN'T AS THOUGH HE'S JUST COMING IN AND SPEAKING ABOUT SOMETHING HE HAS NO EXPERIENCE ABOUT- NO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT. IT HE'S HE'S LIVED WITH THAT WITH HIS CHILD ALSO I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS VALUE TO ME. AND I THINK THAT- THE COMMENT FROM THE OTHER. WITNESS IN OPPOSITION ABOUT THE PERIOD OF TIME. TO TRANSITION. THE LAST THING I WANT IS FOR PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR JOBS AND TO LOSE THE OPPORTUNITIES. BUT I DO WANT THEM TO BE PAID AT LEAST MINIMUM WAGE. SO I JUST THOUGHT I'D KNOW THAT. AT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY YOU YOU WORK WITH OPPOSITION AND TRYING TO FIND. THE BEST WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT. IN THE END IT IS A PROGRAM THAT WILL BE EFFECTIVE ON THE DATE THAT WE SAY THAT IT'S GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE. AND THAT WOULD BE MY ONLY COMMENT ON THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF ANY OTHER COMMENT- IF NOT. THIS. SB SIX OR NINE AT THE HAVE WRECKED TO PASS A Q. SERVICE. SO SENATOR YOU LIKE TO. YES I DO WANT TO- ADDRESSES AND IP- CENTER ON YOU- YOUR REMARKS ABOUT THE PERSONAL CONNECTION THAT- OF MANY INDIVIDUALS HAVE- HAVING SOMEONE IN THEIR OWN FAMILY. BUT I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO REMIND OURSELVES THAT THIS IS A RELIC OF THE NINETEEN THIRTIES THIS STATES BACK TO A TIME WHEN CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES WERE DENIED EDUCATION BEFORE CIVIL RIGHTS THAT LEGISLATION SUCH AS AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY ACT AND END UP BEFORE THE FULL HUMANITY OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES WAS. WAS RECOGNIZED CALIFORNIA'S GONNA JOIN ALASKA CONNECTICUT MARYLAND NEW HAMPSHIRE NEW YORK RHODE ISLAND TEXAS AND WASHINGTON. IN PROHIBITING IS A MINIMUM A SUB MINIMUM WAGE- EMPLOYMENT ON. WE DID IN TALKING TO THE CONCERN OF OR- DID X. THE TIME FOR ANOTHER FOR THREE YEARS THAT WAS A CHANGE WE MADE BUT THERE IS- AS MR CROWTHER'S US SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER. THERE IS A LOT OF MONEY THAT THE STATE IN OUR BUDGET IS INCLUDING WHAT ARE NEEDED ARE UP FOR SERVICES- TO ASSIST THESE INDIVIDUALS- BUT THE FACT OF THEM WORKINGAND HAVING DISABILITY DOES NOT MEAN THEY SHOULD NOT. BE PAID THE MINIMUM WAGE I RESPECTFULLY ASK WE ARE ABLE. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER YES YOU'RE POINTINGTO THE TENTH STATE SO WE'RE NOT EXACTLY ENTRY ON.

THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER. OF MADAM SECRETARY COULD BE TAKE THE WRONG SB SIX TWENTY EIGHT MOTION IS TO PASS THROUGH PROCREATION KALRA. HI KALRA HI FLORA GONZALEZ.

THE BILLS ARE BASICALLY THINK. IN THIS COME IN COMMITTEE ONE BECAUSE OF OUR DOESN'T. OKAY NOW I'M GONNA YOU'RE GONNA AS WE HAVE WITH THE START BECAUSE IS GOING TO GET TO YOU WANT TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD. AS SB THREE THIRTY EIGHT- AND YOU MAY BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SB THREE THIRTY EIGHT WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO PROTECT THE CENTRAL FRONT LINE TRUCK DRIVERS AT CALIFORNIA'S PORTS. FOR TRUCK DRIVERS HAVE BEEN NOTORIOUSLY EXPLOITED BY BAD ACTORS IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY. IS THAT ACTORS ROUTINELY MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS TO CUT COSTS WRONGFULLY EXCLUDE WORKERS FOR MINIMUM WAGE. WORKERS COMPENSATION AND THE RIGHT TO JOIN A UNION. THIS ADDRESSES THIS ONGOING PROBLEM BY ADDING TRUCKING COMPANIES IN EXISTING JOINT LIABILITY BAD ACTOR LIST IF THOSE COMPANIES ROUTINELY MISCLASSIFIED. WORKERS OR FAILED TO ADDRESS SERIOUS CAL OSHA VIOLATIONS. SB THREE THIRTY EIGHT ALSO HOLDS THE MOST EGREGIOUS BAD ACTORS ACCOUNTABLE. BY LOWERING THE THRESHOLD TO GET PUT ON THE BAD ACTOR LIST FOR PRIOR OFFENDERS. THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN FOUND TO HAVE MISCLASSIFIED THEIR WORKERS. WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION. TO REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION BY NEARING THE BILL SO THAT IT FOCUSES ONLY ON THE WORST ACTORS AND LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD FOR GOOD TRUCKING COMPANIES. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY I HAVE SEEN GUSMAN. FROM THE CALIFORNIA TEAMSTERS PUBLIC AFFAIRS COUNCIL AND CAITLIN VEGA FROM. THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS PORT DIVISION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER OF THE OCEAN DOESN'T FALL BY CAITLIN VEGA SHAME WHENEVER YOU'RE READY- YOU MAY BEGIN. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SHANE GOT SPENT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEAMSTERS PUBLIC AFFAIRS COUNCIL. IN SUPPORT AND PROUD TO CO SPONSOR THIS BILL. FOR US THE POINT OF THIS BILL IS TO ADDRESS THE LONG HISTORY OF DRIVER MISS CLASSIFICATION. THAT HAS OCCURRED IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY EVER SINCE IT WAS THE REGULATED FOR DECADES AGO. NO WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE OF THIS PROBLEM GREATER THAN OUR LARGEST PORTS. THEIR EXPLOITATION IS THE DOMINANT ECONOMIC MODEL. TRUCKING COMPANIES HIRE A WORKFORCE OF MOSTLY IMMIGRANT DRIVERS WERE FORCED TO ACT AS IF THEY ARE IN BUSINESS FOR THEMSELVES RESPONSIBLE FOR PURCHASING OR LEASING THEIR OWN TRUCKS. PAYING FOR ALL THE FUEL AND MAINTENANCE ALL THE WHILE ACCEPTING AN EXTREMELY LOW NON NEGOTIABLE RIGHT. IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE MONTHS WHERE THE COST OF MAINTAINING THE TRUCK IS ACTUALLY MORE THAN THE DRIVER MAKES. ON TOP OF THIS THE DRIVERS GET NO HEALTH CARE NO MINIMUM WAGE NO OVERTIME NO WORKERS COMP INJURIES ON THE JOB NO PAID SICK DAYS AND ABSOLUTELY NO PROTECTIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC. THIS IS NOT HYPERBOLE. THESE ARE THE FACTS ON THE GROUND HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS LABOR COMMISSIONER INVESTIGATIONS AND LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN UNIVERSALLY CONCLUDED WITH FINDINGS THAT THE PORT DRAYAGE DRIVERS ARE IN FACT MISCLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. COUNTLESS NEWS ARTICLES HAVE CHRONICLED THIS PROBLEM FOR MANY YEARS NONETHELESS THE PROBLEM PERSISTS. THE TEAMSTERS COMMUNITY GROUPS AND OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO HELP THESE DRIVERS UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY THEY ARE MISCLASSIFIED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. HAS MADE IT VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO ACT COLLECTIVELY. ON FOUR YEARS AGO WE REALIZE THAT THE REAL WAY TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM IS TO GET AT THE ROOT OF IT THE GIANT COMPANIES THAT BENEFIT FROM THE SYSTEM NEED TO TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY. WE SPONSORED SB FORTINO TO LARA WHICH PROVIDES FOR JOINT LIABILITY OF THE COMPANY HIRES ONE OF THESE BAD ACTORS TRUCKING FIRMS TO SHIP ITS GOODS. HOWEVER THERE ARE TOO MANY LOOPHOLES. IN THIS LAW AND LEFT IT INEFFECTIVENESS INEFFECTIVE AT ACHIEVING THIS GOAL. WE NEED SB THREE THREE EIGHT. BUILDINGS AND MAKE SURE EXPLOITATION ENDS ONCE AND FOR ALL THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH- CAITLYN VEGAS WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NUMBER KEEPING DATA ON BEHALF OF SUPPORT DIVISION AT THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS. HOUSE CO SPONSORS SB THREE THREE EIGHT. MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF LAWS THAT ALLOW FOR AT THE CHAIN MY ABILITY TO ENSURE THAT THE CORPORATIONS THAT ARE PROFITING FROM THE EXPLOITATION OF WORKERS AND THE CLASSIFICATION OF WORKERS. ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND HAVE AS BUSINESS REASON TO ENSURE THAT THEY USE RESPONSIBLE CONTRACTORS RATHER THAN DRIVING A RACE TO THE BOTTOM. SB THREE THREE EIGHT MAKE SEVERAL CHANGES TO SB FORTINO TO- TO STRENGTHEN THAT LAW AND TO ENSURE THAT THE REAL BAD ACTORS IN THE INDUSTRY ARE CAPTURED AND HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO BEGIN WITH ADTOKEN SAFETY VIOLATIONS WE SAW WIDESPREAD VIOLATIONS THROUGHOUT THE CODE THE PANDEMIC. DRIVERS NOT BEING PROVIDED PPE- GUARANTEEING EXPOSED TO COPE WITH ON THE JOB SO SERIOUS POLISH AND IRISH AND OUR ATTITUDE THAT- CRITERIA IT ALSO CRETES A CATEGORY FOR PRIOR OFFENDERS BECAUSE WE KNOW WHEN IT'S INDUSTRY MANY MANY OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE ALWAYS HAD A BUSINESS. MODEL ETHNIC CLASSIFICATION. AND I PRIOR AT THE END. SHOULD BE. TREATED MORE. SINCE STATE CONTINUE TO BE A BAD. I'M GLAD IT REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY'S ACTUALLY SHOW. B. I. ART THAT THEY HAVE STOPPED MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS BEFORE THEY GET REMOVED FROM THE LIST. UNTIL IT OUT OF THOSE THREE IMPORTANT PROTECTION BUT ON EACH OF THEM WOULD HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS WE CAN NARROW THE HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS TO INCLUDE ONLY. HELLO CHAU VIOLATION WE HAVE ADDRESSED- THE ISSUES THEY'VE RAISED AROUND DUE PROCESS IN DEFINING WHO IS A PRIOR OFFENDER AND WE HAVE REMOVED THE AUDIT REQUIREMENT. AND TO ENSURE THAT COMPANIES DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS WHILE THE DEALER FEE OR THE P. I. R. CONDUCT AN AUDIT THEY SIMPLY HAVE TO PROVIDE. THE INFORMATION SUFFICIENT TO SHOW THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER MATH CLASSIFIED WE ASK YOU TO GIVE US THE TOOLS TO EFFECTIVELY ENFORCEMENT CLASSIFICATIONS IN THE INDUSTRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH.

THE BILL THE FEDERAL OSHA'S CORPORATE WIDE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT POLICE POLICY BY PROVIDING FELLOWSHIP WITH THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE AN ENTERPRISE WIDE CITATION- THAT WOULD APPLY TO ALL LOCATIONS UNDER COMMON OWNERSHIP WHEN AN EMPLOYER'S POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DIRECTLY VIOLATE LABOR HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. AS CHAIR OF THE SENATE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON PANDEMIC EMERGENCY RESPONSE LAST YEAR I HEARD FIRST HAND HOW OSHA HAD BEEN INUNDATED WITH MORE COMPLAINTS THAN THEIR INSPECTORS CAN HANDLE LEADING STAFF TO INCREASINGLY RELY ON LETTER ONLY OR NOTICE ONLY INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN INSUFFICIENT. SB SIX OF SIX PROVIDES CAL OSHA WITH THE NECESSARY TOOLS TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THEIR LIMITED RESOURCES SO THEY'RE ABLE TO RESPOND MORE EFFECTIVELY TO HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS BY LARGE EMPLOYERS THAT PUT WORKERS LIVES AT RISK.

OF THAT TURNED DEADLY CONTACT BY LARGE CORPORATIONS AND A COMPARTMENT NEEDLESSLY DIFFICULT AND- THAT'S WHY WE NEED AT THE FACT THAT SEX AND THINGS THAT ARE GOING DOLLARS FOR OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. I AM WE BELIEVE AT THE STATE PERFECT IT'S CRITICAL TO OUR STATE'S RECOVERY WE MUST BUT WORK PAY SPREAD AND PREVENT ADDITIONAL OUTBREAK IF WE HAVE ANY. ANY HOPE OF RETURNING TO NORMAL FOR THE REASONS RESPECTFULLY REQUEST- I DON'T NASTY SUCCESS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH UP NEXT YEAR AMID STEIGER- MISTER STRUGGLING EVERYBODY. THANK YOU IN THE CHAIRMAN BIRDS IN THE STEIGER WITH THE- CALIFORNIA LABOR SAID. PROUD TO SPONSOR THE SPELL ALONG YOU. AND WORKSAFE. WE TAKE A LOT OF THE MEN TO THE BILL IT REALLY JUST. FOR YOU THANKS. IT ALLOWS FOR ENTERPRISE WIDE CITATIONS AND THIS DEALS WITH SPECIFIC CASES WHERE. AN EMPLOYER WITH MULTIPLE LOCATIONS. IS BREAKING THE LAW AND ALL OF THOSE LOCATIONS AT ONCE. IT JUST STREAMLINES THE PROCESS OF SETTING UP A PORTER IN A WAY THAT. WE BELIEVE IS VERY FAIR AND JUDICIOUS ESPECIALLY TO EMPLOYERS THAT. DON'T HAVE A BLANKET WORKER SAFETY POLICY ACROSS ALL OF THOSE LOCATIONS. THEY ALSO ESTABLISHES THE CATEGORY OF EGREGIOUS CITATIONS THAT. THE AUTHOR DID A GREAT JOB OF EXPLAINING. JUST WANTED TO SPECIFY THE LOCAL CITATIONS RIGHT NOW ALREADY HAPPENED ABOUT TWO OR THREE TIMES PER YEAR. AND THIS WOULD BE A SUBSET OF THOSE. SO THEY BE EXTRAORDINARILY RARE ONLY USED IN THE WORST OF THE WORST CASES IF EVER. AND IT ALSO CLARIFIES THAT. HELLO SHOULD HAVE THE OPTION OF CITING VIOLATIONS OF THE LABOR CODE. SO RIGHT NOW IN THE LEGISLATURE PASSES THE BILL RELATING TO WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY. THERE'S REALLY NO ONE THERE TO ENFORCE IT AND SO THIS BILL WOULD SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. I JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH ON A FEW OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN. WE HAVE REMOVED THE ECHO THE NINETEEN SPECIFIC WERE POSSIBLE PRESUMPTION OF RETALIATION. WE ALSO DELETED LANGUAGE THAT EXPANDED THE TYPES OF TELOS INVESTIGATIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN A CITATION. AND WE ALSO REPLACED WHAT WAS THE NEW PROCESS OF REVIEWING CERTAIN TYPES OF APPEALS. I JUST BROUGHT IN ONE THAT ALREADY EXISTS SO THAT IT'S SOMETHING FOLKS ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH. AND ALL TOGETHER WE THINK IT'LL REALLY HELP CALLOUS M. TO DO A BETTER JOB IN FUTURE.

AND YOU'LL BE STARTING IN ORDER SB THREE THIRTY ONE YEAH THAT IS FINE ABSOLUTELY. ALL RIGHT WELL GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS ARE MR CHAIRED LIKE TO THINK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL IS MUCH APPRECIATED. SENATE BILL THREE THREE ONE ALSO KNOWN AS THE SILENCE NO MORE ACT EXPANDS THE PROHIBITION ON NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS NDAS. TO NOW COVER SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS INVOLVING ALL FORMS OF HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION THIS BILL ALSO EXPANDS THE PROHIBITION ON OVERLY BROAD CONFIDENTIALITY. AND NON DISPARAGEMENT CLAUSES IN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS TO COVER WORKERS ARE REQUIRED TO SIGN THESE TYPES OF CLAUSES AS PART OF A SEVERANCE AGREEMENT. AS MANY OF YOU MAY REMEMBER I AUTHORED AND THEN GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED SB EIGHT TWENTY ALSO KNOWN AS THE STAND ACT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. SB EIGHT TWENTY SPECIFICALLY BANNED NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS IN CASES OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEX DISCRIMINATION IMPORTANTLY THE SAND ACT ALSO ALLOWS THE CLAIMANT TO REQUEST CONFIDENTIALITY IF THEY SO CHOOSE. IN PASSING THIS HISTORIC LAW THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZE THAT SECRET SETTLEMENTS WERE HELPING TO PERPETRATE HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENTS AND ALLOWING COMPLAINTS TO BE SWEPT UNDER THE RUG. OF COURSE THE SECRET SUMMITS PLAYS MUCH A ROLE IN PERPETUAL FOR. PERPETUATING WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT AND BIAS BASED ON RACE ETHNICITY SEXUAL ORIENTATION AGE DISABILITY RELIGION AMONG OTHERS. BECAUSE HERE TO COMPLAINTS ARE KEPT SECRET AND THOSE WHO RAISE THE COMPLAINTS ARE EFFECTIVELY SILENCED. MEMBERS IT IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR ANY EMPLOYER TO TRY TO SILENCE A WORKER BECAUSE HERE SHE WAS A VICTIM OF ANY TYPE OF HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION. THE SILENCE NO MORE ACTUAL POWER SURVIVORS TO SPEAK OUT IF THEY SO WISH SO THE PERPETRATORS CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND WE CAN HOPEFULLY PREVENT ABUSES FROM CONTINUING TO TORMENT. AND ABUSE OTHER WORKERS. WORKERS SHOULD ALWAYS BE ABLE TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THIS DEPLORABLE BEHAVIOR IN THE WORKPLACE WELL TO DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY AND TO PREVENT FUTURE ABUSES. HERE WITH ME TODAY ALTHOUGH REMOTELY TO SHARE HER OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IS A FORMER AS SO MUCH AS WELL AS MARIE GO. YOU'RE SURE YOSHI HORA SORRY MARIE GO WITH CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR AND SO YES WE HAVE- THE FAMAS ONLINE MOVIE CLICHE HARA UP TO TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE ANSWER FORMA. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIRED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY MY ENTIRE CAREER HAS BEEN ATTACKED PUBLIC POLICY OFFICIAL ENGAGING WITH OFFICES LIKE YOURS. ON BEHALF OF COMPANIES LIKE GOOGLE FACEBOOK AND ENSURE. MY LAST WORK TRIP BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WHAT THE DC PAPERS AT WORK I LEAD ON HEALTH MISINFORMATION. THAT WAS DAYS BEFORE PINTEREST LAWYERS PRESENTED ME WITH A HIGHLY RESPECTED NONDISCLOSURE AND NON DISPARAGEMENT AGREEMENTS I THINK HE NEEDS SILENCE ABOUT THE RACE AND GENDER DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION CLAIM. I'D RATE OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR WHEN I DECIDED TO COME FORWARD PUBLICLY I ALONG WITH THE FORMER COLLEAGUE NAMED ERICA IS THE BANK. DID SO WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WOULD BE COVERED FOR DISCLOSURES RELATED TO GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION UNDER AT THE EIGHT TWENTY WHICH I'M SO GRATEFUL TO STAND AWAY THAT FOR OFFERING DURING THE MEETING WITH MAC. UNFORTUNATELY AS A BLACK WOMAN I CANNOT SEPARATE MY RATE FOR MY GENDER WHICH MEANT THAT MENTIONS AT THE RATE DETERMINATION I AND THERE COULD RESULT IN LEGAL RETALIATION. NO WORKER SHOULD BE IN A POSITION WHERE PART OF THEIR IDENTITY ISN'T COVERED WHEN IT COMES TO DISPOSING UNLAWFUL TREATMENT. AND HE IS LIKE THE ONE I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO FIND ARE USED BY COMPANIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO WORKERS I FUNDAMENTALLY AMERICANS EACH RIGHT. HOW MANY WORKERS CAN REFUSE TO SIGN THESE AGREEMENTS AT THE EXPENSE OF INCOME ARE HEALTH INSURANCE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. WHAT WORK IS THAT COMPANIES DON'T NEED TO ENGAGE THE KEY PROPRIETARY INFORMATION STATE. THAT INFO IS ALREADY PROTECTED THE USE OF CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS EMPLOYEES MIGHT FIND WHEN THEY'RE HIRED ADDITIONALLY A RELEASE OF CLAIMS PARTISAN SEVERANCE AGREEMENT ENSURE COMPANIES DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LITIGATION FROM OUTLYING EMPLOYEES. FINALLY THIS BILL WOULD ALSO BENEFIT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY BY INCREASING TRANSPARENCY FOR SHAREHOLDERS I'M NOT INDIVIDUALS SPEAK UP INVESTORS ARE KEPT IN THE DARK. ABOUT MISCONDUCT AT THE COMPANY IS AND WHY WHICH THEY HAVE FINANCIAL STAKE. LET'S BE SURE ARGUMENT AGAINST THAT COMMON BUT- FAIL OUT MORE ABOUT THOSE IN OFF BAN ABOUT THE BALLOT. SB THREE THIRTY ONE BLOOM AND HAPPEN AND ASSAULT BUT MY HOPE IS THAT ONE SILENCE HAVE NOT THANK. THANK YOU MUCH. UP NEXT THE AMERICAN YOSHIHARU. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. HERE ARE YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- UP BEHIND THE QUALITY WITH THE COW SENATE LAWYERS THAT THEY AND WE PROUD SPONSORS OF THE BILL ALONG WITH THE AND EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES. I'M OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE SEEN A CALL ACROSS CLAUSES LIKE NBA IS AN HONOR AND A GREAT MAN I REALLY BEEN USED AS A WAY TO SILENCE WORKERS ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE IN THE WORKPLACE FEDERAL AND STATE LAW ALREADY HOLD THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS AND LOW REGARD THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT FOR EXAMPLE MAKES IT AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE FOR AN EMPLOYER TO PUNISH OR OTHERWISE PREVENT EMPLOYEES FROM DISCUSSING THE TERM THE CONDITIONS OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. INCLUDING HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION THAT THEY MAY HAVE EXPERIENCE BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW IT WHEN WORKERS LIKE MR DAHMER AND MISSION YOU THE BANK OUT OTHERS WILL JOIN THEM AND THIS IS HOW WORKERS COLLECTIVELY CAN EFFECTUATE REAL CHANGE AND WHY THESE PROTECTIONS ARE NEEDED OPPONENTS OF SB THREE THREE ONE ARGUING THAT THE BILL WILL DISCOURAGE EMPLOYERS FROM PAYING SEVERANCE TO WORKERS AND A SIMILAR ACCUSATION WAS MADE ABOUT SB EIGHT TWENTY THE FAN BACK IT WITH THAT BUT IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE NDA PARTIES WON'T BE ABLE TO KIND OF KEEP THAT AND THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED. WHAT AND HE'S WORKING ON THE TABLE THEY JUST NO LONGER BECAME A PART OF THE NEGOTIATION SIMILARLY AND A SEVEN CONTACT WE KNOW THE TRUE VALUE IN A SEVERANCE AGREEMENT IT IS THE RELEASED THE CLAIM NOT THE SECRECY PROVISION A RELEASE AVOID THE POSSIBILITY OF MINE FOR YEARS OF LITIGATION AND THE POTENTIAL OF AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT. NON DISPARAGEMENT PROVISIONS ARE JUST ADDED TO THE 7 DEGREES MEANT FOR THEIR INTERIM A FAT AWAIT TO INTIMIDATE EMPLOYEES INTO STAYING SILENT AND ADMIT THE NUMBER JUST THAT THIS NOT ONLY HURT THE WORKERS IN A DANGEROUS PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE PUBLIC GOOD ENTER THE DISSERVICE TO LAW ABIDING EMPLOYERS. THIS BILL WILL HELP STOP THESE ABUSES SILENCING TACTICS AND ENSURE MORE WORKERS CAN SPEAK OUT AND CAN SPEAK TOGETHER ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES OF HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION.

STATE SAID NOTHING PROHIBITS RIVETING DISCLOSURE OF THE AMOUNT OF THE SETTLEMENT NOT A SEVERANCE AGREEMENT. WOULD RAISE THE DISCREPANCY AT THE TWENTY ANALYSIS IN THE AMENDMENT TO THE AUTHOR THE SPONSORS- THEY HAVE SO FAR DECLINED TO TAKE THE AMENDMENT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THE BILL AND PRINT NOW COULD BE READ TO PROHIBIT KEEPING THE AMOUNT CONFIDENTIAL ASK CLARITY IN STATUTORY LANGUAGE ABOUT A WIDE LOT DOES OR DOES NOT DO AS ESSENTIAL FOR EMPLOYERS ESPECIALLY OUR SMALL EMPLOYERS WHO MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO LEGAL COUNSEL. IT'S ALSO BENEFICIAL TO COURTS THAT ARE INTERPRETING THESE LIES A COURT MAY LOOK AT SUBSECTION E. IS PRESENTLY WRITTEN I BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE INTENTIONALLY CHOSE ONLY TO MENTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS NOT SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS OF THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY ANALYSIS AGREED THAT THIS CLARIFICATION WOULD BE BENEFICIAL RECOMMENDING THIS AMENDMENT BE MADE TO ASSUAGE REASONABLE CONCERNS THE STATUE NOT BE READ MORE BROADLY THAN INTENDED. THAT ANALYSIS ALSO CORRECTLY POINTED OUT THAT CCP SECTION ONE ZERO ZERO ONE WHICH THE BILL ALSO AMENDS CONTAINS A PROVISION CLARIFYING THAT IT SHALL NOT PRECLUDE AGREEMENTS THAT PROHIBIT DISCLOSURE OF THE AMOUNT.

NINE NINE NINE WAS IMPLEMENTED TO REQUIRE MOST HEALTH INSURANCE. AND CAL. TO COVER A YEARS TO. OF BIRTH DISPENSED AT ONE TIME. DESPITE THE PROGRESS MADE IN CALIFORNIA HEALTH DISPARITIES IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH.

IT IS TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO MODERNIZE AND EXPAND ITS CONTRACEPTIVE EQUITY LAWS. TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO CONTRACEPTIVE CARE IMPROVE SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. AND CREATE GREATER HEALTH EQUITY. TO THAT END SB FIVE TWENTY THREE ACCOMPLISHES THE FOLLOWING MAKE CALIFORNIA'S CONTRACEPTIVE EQUITY LAWS GENDER INCLUSIVE. REQUIRES COVERAGE OF OVER THE COUNTER BIRTH CONTROL OPTIONS TO INCREASE ACCESS. TO TIME SENSITIVE CARE. EXPANDS CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE TO MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS BY EXPANDING BENEFITS.

CALIFORNIA CAN AND MUST ADVANCE PROACTIVE SOLUTIONS TO ENSURE THE CONTROL THEY WANT WHEN THEY WANT IT WITHOUT DELAY. WE RESPECTFULLY PERSPECTIVE REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB FIVE TWENTY THREE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND THEN UP NEXT ANNUAL GROSSMAN. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK MY NAME IS DR DANIEL GROSSMAN AND I'M A PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE SCIENCES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. AS A PRACTICING GYNECOLOGIST I KNOW VERY WELL THE CRITICAL WORLD BUT CONTRACEPTION PLAYS IN THE LIVES OF MY PATIENTS. ALLOWING THEM TO PLAN IF AND WHEN THEY WANT TO HAVE. CHILDREN AND GIVING THEM MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR LIVES. I ALSO KNOW FROM MY PRACTICE BUT NOT EVERY CONTRACEPTIVE METHOD IS RIGHT FOR EVERY PRSON AND PEOPLE HAVE INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES ABOUT WHAT TEACHERS OVER BIRTH CONTROL METHODS ARE IMPORTANT TO THEM. SB FIVE TWENTY THREE ADDRESSES IMPORTANT SHORTCOMINGS OF EXISTING LEGISLATION BY MANDATING COVERAGE FOR THE FULL RANGE OF CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS. INCLUDING PROTECT ME INCLUDING OVER THE COUNTER MEDICINES WITHOUT REQUIRING A PRESCRIPTION WHICH WE KNOW THAT CERTAIN POPULATIONS THAT SENATOR WEBER MENTIONED. ESPECIALLY BLACK INDIGENOUS OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR. AS WELL AS THOSE LIVING ON LOW INCOMES CONTINUE TO FACE BARRIERS TO OBTAINING A BIRTH CONTROL THAT THEY WANT. PARTICULARLY IN THIS MOMENT IN THE WAKE OF A PANDEMIC THAT HAS AFFECTED SO MANY WE NEED TO REMOVE ALL OF THE REMAINING BARRIERS TO ACCESSING EFFECTIVE CONTRACEPTION. RIGHT NOW IF SOMEONE WANTS TO USE AN OVER THE COUNTER CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS SUCH AS SPERMICIDE WORK FOR MODEL EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION. WERE IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE AN OTC REGULAR BIRTH CONTROL PILL. THE ONLY WAY TO GET INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THAT. OTC CONTRACEPTION IS IF THEY GET A PRESCRIPTION FIRST AND NOT REALLY JUST MAKES NO SENSE. THE FDA HAS ALREADY DETERMINED THAT THOSE METHODS ARE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE ENOUGH TO BE SOLD WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION. AND REQUIRING SOMEONE TO GET A MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY PRESCRIPTIONS IN ORDER TO GET INSURANCE COVERAGE UNDERMINES THE IMPROVEMENT AND ACCESS- THAT OTC. STATUS CONFERS. SB FIVE TWENTY THREE WILL REMEDY THIS INCONSISTENCY. FINALLY AS A MEMBER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY I STAND WITH MY FACULTY COLLEAGUES AND YOU SEE STUDENTS.

EXCELLENT THANK YOU MUCH SB SEVENTY SEVEN AIMS TO PREVENT WAIT STAFF WITHIN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO GO AFTER THE BAD ACTORS IN THE INDUSTRY. AND HELP THOSE THAT PLAY BY THE RULES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEIR WORKERS ARE PAID ON TIME. CALIFORNIA'S CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY BUILT OUR WORLD CLASS INFRASTRUCTURE IS A KEY DRIVER OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND PROVIDED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HOUSING UNITS ANNUALLY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF A GROWING CALIFORNIA POPULATION. DUE TO THE SKILLS REQUIRED AND THE FAIR WAGES AND BENEFITS WORKERS RECEIVED THE INDUSTRY PROVIDED A PATHWAY TO THE MIDDLE CLASS FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHO COULDN'T AFFORD THE HOMES THAT THEY BUILT. UNFORTUNATELY FOR MORE THAN THE LAST FORTY YEARS THE STANDARDS HAVE GRADUALLY BEEN A ROADING ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT CRITERIA OVER 50% OF CALIFORNIA'S CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE FAMILIES. CURRENTLY FALL IN THE LOW INCOME CATEGORY CATEGORY LESS THAN 80% OF THE MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME. AS AND OVER ONE THIRD OF ALL CONSTRUCTION FAMILIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS VERY LOW INCOME EARNING LESS THAN 50% OF THE MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME. LIKE MANY OTHER SECTORS CONSTRUCTION WORKERS HAVE GONE DOWN BUT WAGE THEFT AND CASH PAYMENTS HAVE INCREASED AND A KEY FACTOR FOR THIS IS THE LACK OF ENFORCEMENT OF BASIC LABOR LAWS ON JOB SITES. UNSCRUPULOUS CONTRACTORS THAT DO NOT PLAY BY THE RULES HAVEN'T ILLEGAL AND UNFAIR ADVANTAGE OVER ON ITS CONTRACTORS AS THE UNDERMINE WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY. BUT I WILL SHARE THAT WELL AB SEVENTEEN OH ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER THURMAN AT THE TIME WHICH TOOK EFFECT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN HAS MADE SOME DIFFERENCE IT IS NOT DONE ENOUGH SOME CONTRACTORS STILL CONSIDER WAGE THEFT JUST A COST OF DOING BUSINESS. HERE WITH ME TODAY IS DANNY CURTAIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE OF CARPENTERS. THANK YOU SO MUCH- YES. WE HAVE ONE WITNESS. SO WE HAVE ONE WITNESS A DANIEL. YOU MAY BEGIN WHENEVER YOU READY. A RECENT BERKELEY NINETY FOUR. ALMOST HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S TO WORK WITH. FROM THAT. FOUR THREE DOLLARS VERY VALUES BE LEGAL ONE PRACTICE PRIMARILY JUST FIVE. HANG ON TABLE TO MINIMIZE COSTS. EIGHT TWENTY FORTY ECONOMIC GROUND REPORT INCLUDED CONSTRUCTION WORKERS THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY TAKE FIFTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR TO THE OF- WITH THIS THE LADY REFERRED TO- SHOW OVERHEAD THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS BEING ABLE OR LOWER AND TO STAY. BUT I WANT TO OUT AT THE LOWEST LEVEL THE EXTREME LOW LET THAT'S ABOUT 84% PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THAT CATEGORY. IN THE FOUR DECADES BETWEEN NINETEEN SIXTY TO TWENTY TEN IT WAS AN INCREASE OF A 4100% THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. CURRENTLY ALMOST 20% OF ALL CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ARE IN THE ON UNDERGROUND ECONOMY OFF THE BOOKS UNDER REPORTER MISCLASSIFIED. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION WAS A ONE HUNDRED NINETY BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY EDT ESTIMATED SIXTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN CREDIT CONSTRUCTION WAITED WAGES WERE LEGALLY REPORTED. WITH TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS UNREPORTED AND THREE TO FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN LOST TAXES. OF TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS OF UNREPORTED WAGES THAT YEAR THE BUREAU FIELDING FORCES FORSMAN COLLECTED LESS THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN WAGES AND PENALTIES THAT DOESN'T EVEN SHOW UP AS A STATISTIC OR A BLIP. FOR ALMOST THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CONTRACTORS IN CALIFORNIA THE CHANCES OF FACING INSPECTION- ABOUT ONCE EVERY THREE HUNDRED YEARS. SO WE HAVE A FAILURE OF ENFORCEMENT OF FAILURE OF INSPECTION AND A FAILURE OF COLLECTION THE CRIME DOES PAY IN THIS INDUSTRY AND HONEST CONTRACTORS ARE BEING DRIVEN OUT OF THE INDUSTRY. THE GENERAL CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBLE FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT THE ONLY ENTITY TO HAS THE ABILITY THE TOOLS AND THE AUTHORITY TO MONITOR EVERY ASPECT OF A PROJECT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERALL SAFETY OF A PROJECT THEY MANAGE THE SEQUENCING OF A PROJECT FROM THE GROUND UP THEY ORGANIZED THE TIMING DELIVERY OF MATERIALS TO A PROJECT. THEY HIRE AND OVERSEE THE WORK OF THE SUBCONTRACTORS IF NOT THE WORK'S NOT DONE RIGHT THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE IT'S CRITICAL THAT PRIVATE SECTOR PLAYS A BIGGER ROLE AND THAT'S THE THEME I'M HEARING NOW IN POLICING ITS OWN INDUSTRY IN THIS COMMITTEE. SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN EDGE JOINT LIABILITY FOR PENALTIES OR LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR WAGE THEFT IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. THIS IS A INTERESTING JOINED SEVERAL LIABILITIES A CENTURIES OLD LEGAL CONCEPT FOR pSHARED RESPONSIBILITY THAT PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE ABOLITION OF CHILD LABOUR IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS. IT'S NOT A PANACEA BUT IT'S IMPORTANT STEP. SCHERING LIABILITY AS A WAY OF CHANGING BEHAVIOR. WE'VE TAKEN SEVERAL SUBSTANTIAL AMENDMENTS RECOMMENDED BY CONTRACTORS BECAUSE THEY MADE SENSE. WE DROP THE LIABILITY FOR FAILURE TO PAY WORKERS COMP INSURANCE AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE NOT BECAUSE WE WANTED TO. BUT BECAUSE OF THE CONTRACTORS POINTED OUT IT IS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE DIRECT CONTRACTOR TO MONITOR THOSE PAYMENTS. WE PROVIDED AN OFF RAMP. FROM THE ADDED LIABILITY MODELED ON EXISTING PUBLIC WORKERS THAT PUBLIC WORKS STATUTES IF A DIRECT CONTRACTOR REGULARLY MONITORS THEIR SUB CONTRA TRACTORS. LEGALLY REQUIRED PAYROLL RECORDS AND DILIGENTLY TAKES CORRECTIVE ACTION WHEN THERE'S A PROBLEM. A RECENT NEWSPAPER ARTICLE ACACIA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OVER LUNCH IF YOU CAN WIND UP ALMOST DONE BUT I WAS SORT OF DOING THE TO. STEPHANIE I AM GOOD I'M ALMOST AT. THAT HEY THERE WAS A RECENT NEWSPAPER ARTICLE IN CASE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OVER ONE MILLION STOLEN WAGES DISCOVERED BY WORKERS COMP AUDIT. ENDED WITH THIS STATEMENT PROSECUTORS CANNOT IDENTIFY MANY OF THE ELIGIBLE WORKERS BECAUSE OF SCANT EMPLOYEE RECORDS THAT'S GOT TO STOP SB SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN IS NOT A PANACEA BUT WILL MAKE A DENT. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE THIS IS NOT A WAGE BILL THERE ARE NO WAGE STANDARDS BEYOND ALREADY EXISTING LAW MINIMUM WAGE EIGHT HOUR DAY AT CETERA IT'S A WAGE. THEFT BILL TO PLAY BY THE RULES BILL. KEEP LEGALLY. PAYROLL RECORDS AND PAY WHAT YOU PROMISE NO CHEATING NO LOOKING THE OTHER WAY WHEN YOUR SUBCONTRACTOR BREAKS THE LAW. THIS BILL WILL HELP WORKERS GET WHAT THEY EARN AND WIL GIVE US CONTRACTORS THAT PLAY BY THE RULES A CHANCE TO GET BACK INTO THE INDUSTRY. I WANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK CENTER THE LABOR FOR THE HARD WORK SHE'S BEEN DOING ON THE CENTER STAFF. PARTICULAR IN THIS DIFFICULT TIME.

ACTUALLY THE MICROPHONE SET UP. SO BEGINS SOON AS THE MICE READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER MEMBER- MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SYLVIA FOR OUR BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION HERE IN OPPOSITION- YOU KNOW. EVERYTHING WE JUST HEARD ABOUT WAGE THEFT ABOUT GETTING BAD ACTORS WE ARE FULLY ALIGNED WITH THAT I'M SENATOR LEYVA WE ARE FULLY ALIGNED WITH THAT. WE ARE HERE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY AND OFFER MEN IS TO TRY TO MAKE IT WORK- THE VERY FOUNDATION OF THIS BILL IS BUILT OFF A CONCEPT OF PAYROLL REVIEW BEING CONDUCTED. OF OUR SUBCONTRACTORS SO SUBCONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE WE HAVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION SO THAT PAYROLL REVIEW CAN BE DONE IF THAT FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENT IS NOT DONE WELL AND IT IS NOT DONE CORRECTLY. THIS BILL IS GOING TO BE MEANINGLESS BECAUSE WE WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO COURT RECORDS THAT ARE MEANINGFUL SO THAT WHO EVER LOOKS AT THEM CAN LOOK AT IT AND DETERMINE IF THERE IS A VIOLATION OF LAW. THAT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO MAKING THIS BILL WORK IT WILL NEVER WORK IF WE DON'T GET THAT RIGHT WE BELIEVE THAT THIS COULD BE A TOOL FOR THE GUT. WE ARE ASKING FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY WE ARE COMING TO YOU TO SAY LISTEN WE WILL BE HELPFUL WE WILL BE PARTICIPATORY BUT WHEN WE ARE NOT WAGE THEFT INVESTIGATORS OUR MEMBERS ARE NOT STAFFED UP WITH PEOPLE IN THEIR OFFICES WHO ARE. TRAINED AND HAVE TAKING CLASSES AND HAVE EDUCATION AND HOW TO PILE THROUGH WHAT COULD BE. HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF PAYROLL RECORDS AND IDENTIFY A VIOLATION OF LAW THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY DO. JUST YESTERDAY WE SUBMITTED A THIRD SET OF AMENDMENTS WHAT WE THOUGHT WERE PARED BACK THAT AMENDMENTS WOULD SAY. THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT COULD DO THE REVIEW. THEY ARE CURRENTLY THE ENFORCING AGENCY TO DO THIS THEY ARE- THEY ARE EQUIPPED THEY ARE SKILLED AT THIS IT IS WHAT THEY DO NUMBER THREE. DON'T BE THROWN OFF BY THIS WE WILL PAY FOR IT. SO ARE AMENDMENTS WERE CLEAR THAT WE WILL PAY FOR THAT WILL BE A COST WE KNOW THAT WE WILL PAY FOR IT. AND I WE HOPE OUR AMENDMENTS WERE CLEAR THAT EVEN IF THE LSE DOES THE REVIEW WE ARE NOT BEING ASKED TO BE RELIEVED OF ANY LIABILITY WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE ON THE HOOK FOR PENALTIES. FOR EIGHT ANYTHING ELSE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT EMPLOYEE GETS PAID WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE NEXT PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT SAYS HALL PAYMENT RECTIFY THE ISSUE GET THE EMPLOYEE PAID. WE WILL DO THOSE THINGS WE ARE COMING TO YOU TO TELL YOU THERE IS A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS. I MEAN I THINK THEY'RE IT'S SAFE TO SAY THERE IS A LOT OF. DISTRUST AMONGST DIRECT CONTRACTORS SUBS EMPLOYEES EVERYWHERE IN BETWEEN. IT ISN'T CLEAR TO US WHEN WE ARE SAYING HEY WE ARE NOT THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO DO THIS. WE HOPE THAT IS TAKING A HEART WE ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS WITH WE HEART PHILLY FEEL LIKE WE'VE OFFERED A FEW OFFERS OF AMENDMENTS TO MAKE THIS WORK. HAPPY TO KEEP THAT CONVERSATION GOING BUT AT THIS TIME A POST THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANYONE IN THE ROOM IN OPPOSITION. THAT'S BECAUSE ON TWENTY SEVEN NOT WILL GO TO MONTEZ THE MONEY AND THEN MODERATOR ANYONE IN OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE SB SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN. IN OPPOSITION OF SB SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN THE ZERO. ONE NINE ZERO FAIR IN OPPOSITION OF SB. SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN. AND ONE MOMENT WE DO HAVE ONE IN Q. AND THEN AGAIN IT IS ONE THAT IS ZERO IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION. OF THE SB SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN. AND WE WILL GO TO LINE OF TWO FIFTY SEVEN YOUR LINES OPEN. MISTER AREN MEMBERS PARKING CHEN FEN ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSING CONTRACTORS OF CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION TO AT THE TIME TO CHECK THANK YOU SO MUCH I DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON SB SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN. YOUR BILL MOTION A SECOND SUMMER GONZALEZ. I AND I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T OBVIOUSLY HAD A CHANCE TO ASK- THE YOUR SPONSOR BUT IT IT SEEMS AS IF- THE BUILDERS ARE GETTING INTO A PLACE OF TRYING TO OFFER UP A SOLUTION THAT'S GRACEFUL OF JUST WONDER IF THERE'S BEEN ANY AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE THE RIGHT PERSON ASKED IF THERE'S BEEN ANY DISCUSSION WITH. THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE IF THEY'D EVEN BE WILLING TO DO THIS IF THE FUNDING WAS THERE WE CAN I WILL TO SAY WE JUST GOT THE AMENDMENTS YESTERDAY WE ARE LOOKING AT THEM WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTIONS WE JUST DON'T KNOW. I WOULD SAY THAT WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF REALLY GOOD DISCUSSIONS WITH C. B. I A AND I APPRECIATE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH US AND WE GET SOMETHING SO AS WE ALL KNOW SOME AMENDMENTS ROCKFORD IN THERE JUST NOT WORKABLE TO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IN THE BILL. BUT I APPRECIATE THAT THEY CONTINUE TO TRY TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING SO THAT WE CAN GET THEM TO A SUPPORT OR EVEN AT. A NEUTRAL POSITION SO WE'LL KEEP TALKING. THANK YOU SIR WHAT NINE I ALSO REALLY APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THIS ON- I'M WONDERING IN IN ALL THE DISCUSSIONS YOU HAD IF YOU FEEL LIKE THE EMPLOYERS HAVE THEIR CAPACITY RIGHT NOW TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ALL OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO REALLY THAT THE THAT THE FILES- AND TO TALKING TO THE POINT ARE RAISED. AM I APPRECIATE YOUR STUDYING THESE IS ERROR ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITIES WITHOUT LETTING RESPONSIBILITY THAT I THINK THAT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO IT WHAT WOULD WANT TO ACHIEVE IN THIS BILL- WHAT WHAT ARE SOME OTHER WAYS THAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO- HAVE THE SUPPORT NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE BILL HOUSES EMPLOYMENT SO WITH THAT YES THE NOTE HERE ANSWER I THINK THAT THE EMPLOYERS ARE READY THEY DO HAVE THE CUT- CAPACITY IN THE CAPABILITIES IN SOME REGARDS BUT I THINK IT TOO CBA'S POINT WOULD YOU WANT AN ACCURATE LIST AND WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THEY KNOW WHO THEY'RE LOOKING FOR- SO WE'RE JUST CONTINUING TO WORK ON IT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN COME UP WITH THE CLEAN THIS BILL POSSIBLE THAT ACTUALLY. SOLVE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE WAGE THEFT SHOULD NOT BE A COST OF DOING BUSINESS AFTER AND THIS IS ON THE PAST TO APPROPRIATIONS OKAY GREAT LIMITED ISSUE EDITION ASSURING THEM AND THEN APPROPRIATIONS FALL OKAY SO THE REAL MARK SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO BE ABLE. TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES. THANK YOU VERY S. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE. IT IN CASE THAT WASN'T CLEAR I AM. SO OF THIS BILL I'M- I WAS JUST ASK BECAUSE WE DO WANT IT TO BE WE WANT TO WORK I DON'T I FEEL LIKE IN YOU AND I BOTH HAVE BEEN LABOR MOVEMENT- BEFORE COMING INTO OFFICE AND- I REMEMBER GOING OUT TO. IMPERIAL COUNTY WHICH IS PART OF MY- JURISDICTION THEY FELL CHAU N. JUST. SEEN LINES OF- A LICENSE PLATES FROM OTHER PLACES- AND ONE OF THE MANY THINGS THAT IS OFTEN USED TO PULL PEOPLE IN AND- CIRCUMVENT THE LAW WAS CALIFORNIA'S LAWS I MEAN AND IT'S LIKE WHACK A MOLE BASICALLY ESPECIALLY WITH THEM THE SUBCONTRACTORS AND THE THEIR ABILITY TO BRING AND- YOU KNOW KIDS LABOR CHILD LABOR LABOR FROM MEXICO LABOR FROM UTAH AND ARIZONA- AND JUST RIGHT HERE BUT YOU KNOW VIOLATING THE LAW SO. THIS IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT- AND I KNOW HOW MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE LOSE A YEAR BECAUSE OF THIS AT THE STATE EVEN- SO THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS BILL I'M FULLY SUPPORTIVE IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS- AT THAT THAT THE BUILDERS CAN ACTUALLY DO THIS IS WHAT WE I THINK WHAT WE WANT TO DO AND I DON'T KNOW IF- IN IT. IF IT'S OKAY IF I CAN ASK THE SPONSOR THEN IF THAT THE DISCUSSIONS ARE ONGOING. YES ABSOLUTELY. SO AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS- I MADE IT CLEAR AND WE MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IF IT'S GOING TO ACTUALLY HELP GET THE JOB DONE. OR WERE YOU CANNOT MONITOR IT WE WILL NOT REQUIRE YOU TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SOMETHING YOU CAN'T MONITOR. BUT A GOOD PORTION OF THE INDUSTRY ALREADY DOES THIS. AND THEY DO HAVE SUPERINTENDENCE AND THEY DO HAVE TO SCHEDULE THIS MASSIVE. YOU KNOW PROJECT. AT THE LARGER THE MORE COMPLICATED AND THEY DO HAVE PEOPLE WATCHING HOW MANY WORKERS FOR THE SUB THEY HAVE CONTRACTS SO IT'S DOABLE- THE IDEA OF PAYING THE D. I. R. WAS BROUGHT UP YESTERDAY HE CAN. YOU MIGHT IMAGINE WE WERE QUITE INTERESTED IN THE CONCEPT BUT IT WAS KINDA LATE BOB THERE'S NOTHING IN IN THE LAW THAT SAYS THEY CAN'T HIRE. SOMEBODY TO HELP AUDIT YOU KNOW OR NOT AUDIT BUT AT LEAST REVIEW IT'S NOT MANDATORY THAT EVERY SUBCONTRACTOR HAS TO PROVIDE. ALL OF THEIR PAYROLL ROLL RECORDS ALL OF THE TIME JUST WHEN THEY ARE ASKED TO HAVE TO OR YOU WITH HOLD WHAT YOU OWE THEM FOR THOSE PAYROLL RECORDS THAT THAT'S A FAIRLY POWERFUL A TOOL RIGHT THERE. YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO HAVE BOXES OF IT WHEN YOU SUSPECT SOMETHING YOU SEE LESS PEOPLE ON THE JOB. YOUR SUPERVISOR SEAT LEFT PEOPLE ON THE JOB FOR YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE CONCRETE PORTION OF IT. YOU SEE LET'S SEE YOUR PAYROLL RECORDS AND THEN YOU START THE BALL ROLLING BUT WE ARE. ACTUALLY IN CONVERSATION QUITE A BIT AND OUR EYES WELL IMPRESSED WITH THE CONCEPT THAT- WE WENT FROM SORT OF- WE DON'T NEED TO DO IT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IT AND MAYBE YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT OR WE CAN. IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT WE WOULD DO IT. THAT'S A BIG MOVEMENT SO WE'RE WE'RE WILLING TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION QUITE A BIT. I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC IF WE CAN FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO GET MORE MONEY INTO ON LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT AND GENERAL. STATE SO I JUST WAS INTRIGUED A LITTLE OR TO THE CONTINUE CONVERSATION OBVIOUSLY I SAID ON JUDICIARY. IT EVENTUALLY COMES TO US AND APPROPRIATIONS SO LOOK. FOR A CONTINUED WORK ON OKAY THANK YOU. HI THANK YOU ALL. SO MUCH AND LOOK BACK. FOR ANY CLOSING COMMENTS FROM SENATOR LEYVA. I WOULD JUST SAY TO A FAMILY MEMBER INVOLVED AS POINT IT'S EXACTLY RIGHT WE WANT TO WORKABLE BILL- ANY BILL THAT WE DO IT ENFORCEMENT. AND HOW IT ACTUALLY IF IT IS SIGNED INTO LAW HOW DOES IT ACTUALLY IN THE REAL WORLD. ACTUALLY WORKS AND IS IT PRACTICAL SO WE'RE VERY COGNIZANT OF THAT TOO BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU PUT SOMETHING INTO LAW. THAT SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITHOUT BEING REDUNDANT- SO THANK YOU ALL FOR THE QUESTIONS AND THE DISCUSSION I APPRECIATE IT. AND WE HAVE WORKED VERY WELL. TOGETHER AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE DOING IT WE'VE GOT A LITTLE WAYS TO GO AND- LIKE I SAID HOPEFULLY CAN GET TO SOMETHING THAT WHERE BY WALKS WITH A LITTLE HAPPY. AND A LITTLE UNHAPPY. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY HOUSE FRONT ABOUT THANK YOU SO MUCH- MANUFACTURE TAKE ROLL. ON AS PRESENT MYSELF. MOST IS TO PASS THROUGH JUDICIARY. KALRA I KALRA AYE LARA. AND SALAS. SALAS I JONES SAWYER. RADIUS REASSIGNED ZERO FORD. FORD II. THE DOES NOT THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU AND UP NEXT TO SANDERS STERN BE IT WE HAVE JUST THREE BILLS LEFT BUT- WE'VE BEEN GOING OUT OF FOR A WHILE SO I'M GOING TO. LITTLE MORE STRICTLY ANOTHER MORE STRICTLY ENFORCED THE- TWO MINUTES FOR WITNESSES A LOT OF THE OTHERS WERE. WE DON'T HAVE OPPOSITION SO AS LITTLE MORE. LET'S GO CURRENTLY. I'M AYE DOES GIVE THE GAVEL TO THE SUMMER GONZALEZ. OKAY THAT REALLY. OKAY SO MEASURE. STARTED OFF TO GOOD START. I WON'T TALK PASSED YES I'LL JUST BRIEFLY STATE THAT THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT UPPING OUR SAFETY STANDARDS IN THE QUALITY OF WAGES- IN IN THE SECTOR I THINK THAT WE WRESTLE WITH THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR WE HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH OURSELVES AND REALIZE THAT- WE DO PRODUCE A LOT OF OIL AND GAS IN THE STATE AND THAT. THE PEOPLE WORKING THERE SECTORS- HAVE IMMENSE SKILLS AND- THE STANDARD SHOULD BE IMPROVED UPON AND FRANKLY- THOSE JOBS CAN BE LIFE OR DEATH AND SO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING SKILLED AND TRAIN WORKERS AND- AND SUBCONTRACTED WORKERS PAYING LESS THAN PREVAILING WAGE IS A PROBLEM. IF WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA HAVE A JUST ECONOMY WHICH I KNOW YOU ALL SPENT A LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT- IT STARTS IN IN IN ALL SECTORS OF OUR OF OUR ENERGY ECONOMY NOT JUST THE RENEWABLE SIDE TOO SO- I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION HERE TODAY AND RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL THANK YOU SO MUCH AND WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES- UP TO TWO MINUTES EACH ANIMAL WILL USE THE BUZZER. OF ALL THE WITNESSES GOING FORWARD MORE STRICTLY BUT WHAT WE HAVE WITH US RON MILLER AND JEREMY SMITH AND- SO IF MR. MILLER IS ON THE PHONE YOU MAY BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. OKAY THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. I'M RON MILLER EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF THE LA ORANGE COUNTY BUILDING TRADES. BUT I'M HERE TODAY SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SKILLED AND TRAINED MEN AND WOMEN UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITH THOUSANDS THAT MAKE A LIVING IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. INSPIRED BY SB FIFTY FOUR THE MAJORITY. OF CALIFORNIA REFINERIES CONVERTED TO A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. PRIOR TO THIS MOST OF THE WORKERS WERE WHO PERFORMED LABOR INTENSIVE WORK IN THE REFINERIES. WERE A TRANSIT WORKFORCE MOSTLY FROM OUT OF STATE. NOT FROM CALIFORNIA. AND DID NOT HAVE THE LEVEL OF TRAINING THAT THE SKILLED AND TRAINED. TRADESPEOPLE HAD. ALSO THEY DID NOT SPEND THEIR MONEY IN THE COMMUNITY. INSTEAD THEY TOOK MOST OF THEIR MONEY HOME WITH THEM TO THE STATE THAT THEY RESIDED IN. IS IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE SAFETY OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO TRANSITION THESE OPERATIONS. SO THE WORKERS WERE THE MOST SKILLED AND TRAINED CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN THE COUNTRY. AND AT THEIR LOCAL WORKERS WHO LIVE IN A COMMUNITY. THAT ARE HOST TO THE REFINERIES. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS INDUSTRY AND HAS HAD ACCIDENTS IN THE PAST WHETHER THROUGH HUMAN ERROR LACK OF UPKEEP TO THE INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE TO HAVE THE UPMOST SAFETY IN MIND AND THAT COMES OF TRAINING AND WITH THE BUILDING TRADE SPENDING OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON APPRENTICESHIP AND JURNEE pWORKER TRAINING. THIS IS HOW WE MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF CONSISTENT SAFETY. THIS IS THE SAME SOLID ARGUMENT THAT SUPPORTS THIS BILL. CALIFORNIA'S ALL FILLED SHOULD BE MAINTAINED BY THE MOST HIGHLY TRAINED AND DIVERSE TRADES PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. WITH THE CHANGES THAT THIS INDUSTRY IS FACING IN YEARS TO COME. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE GET THE WORK FORCE IN PLACE SO WE CAN DO THE WORK SAFELY INTO THE FUTURE. WITH BOTH REFINERIES IN CALIFORNIA RESOURCES. WE HEARD FROM LOCAL CONTRACTORS THEY WERE CONCERNED WHEN THIS CHANGE HAPPEN. THAT THEY WERE CONCERNED IT WAS NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THESE PROJECTS. WHAT WE FOUND AROUND THE STATE FROM C. R. C. OIL FIELDS IN LONG BEACH. THE MID COAST AND KERN. AND THE REFINERIES IN LOS ANGELES IN THE NORTH BAY. THE CONTRACTOR SIMPLY ADOPTED AND ENJOY THE BENEFIT OF BRINGING ON A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO ENHANCE THE HIRING OF MEN AND WOMEN FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. COMMUNITY COLLEGES WORKFORCE INVESTMENT PROGRAMS WITH OUR PRINTER SHIP READINESS PROGRAMS. PUTTING VETERANS FORMALLY INCARCERATED AND FOLKS FROM THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. INTO WORLD CLASS APPRENTICESHIPS THAT PROVIDE TRAINING THAT LEADS TO GOOD MIDDLE CLASS CAREERS WITH FAMILY HEALTH CARE. IN A MODEST RETIREMENT THANK YOU MISS MILLER. ENOUGH ABOUT THESE. WE'RE PROUD OF THE WORK OUR MEMBERS DO IN CALIFORNIA'S OIL FIELDS AND REFINERIES UTILIZING THE MOST HIGHLY TRAINED WORKERS IN THE NATION. TO PRODUCE HOMEGROWN ENERGY UNDER THE MAASTRICHT STRICTEST ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN THE WORLD.

AT THE OUTSET I'D LIKE TO MAKE CLEAR EVERYONE. OUR ORGAN. DO NOT OPPOSE THIS AND TRAINED WORKFORCE CAL. THREE OF OUR FOUR STATEWIDE CHAPTERS PRODUCE SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. AND SO THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE HERE BUT WE DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH SB FOUR ONE NINE. BECAUSE IT IMPACTS SEVENTEEN THOUSAND MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK IN KERN COUNTY. NOW THOSE PEOPLE ARE FIVE WOMEN. 18% VETERANS. AND THIRTY PERCENT. FORMALLY INCARCERATED. THESE ARE THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE CURRENTLY WORKING IN KERN COUNTY IN THE OIL FIELDS. AS THIS BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED. ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TO. 30% OF THAT WORK FORCE WILL BE DISPLACED. AND THAT IS BECAUSE THE REQUIREMENTS STATED IN THE BILL. WILL FIND THEM TO BE. UNFIT AND UNSAFE. GEORGE HUMMERS GONNA TO THE C. ASK OF THE BILLS I WANTED IN. BUT IN A TIME OF COATED IN A TIME OF SKYRIM. SKY HIGH ON IN RATES. WIRE DISPLACING MEN AND WOMEN IN KERN COUNTY. SOME OF THE HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES. OF THE PANDEMIC. AND SO WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO THE AUTHOR WE HAVE ASKED FOR SOME AMENDMENTS. I KNOW THERE WERE SOME COMMITMENTS MADE. WE'RE HOPING TO SEE LANGUAGE SOON WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING YET WHAT WE WOULD LIKE IS WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION. WE WOULD LIKE TO FIND A WAY TO. PROTECT THOSE SEVENTEEN THOUSAND WORKERS IN KERN COUNTY. AND ALSO THERE IS A MULTI CROP CURRICULUM. THAT IS USED IN KERN COUNTY THAT WAS CREATED BY THE OIL INDUSTRY FOR OIL AND GAS WORKERS AND AS MR HARMER WILL SAY RIGHT BEHIND ME HAS PRODUCED SOME OF THE SAFEST WORKFORCE IN CALIFORNIA. I REGINALD THANK YOU THANK YOU. MR HARMER I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A- AS A MEETINGS ON JIM'S IS GOOD TO SEE YOU IN PERSON SO YEAH AN IDEA WILL YOU. UP MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS GEORGE HARMON I'M FROM BIGGER STILL CALIFORNIA HERE IN STRONG OPPOSITION OF SB FOUR ONE NINE THE WHOLE PREMISE OF THE BILL FOUR ONE NINE IS BASED OFF THE SAFETY. AND I'VE SHARED SOME DATA WITH ALL OF YOU IN ACTUALLY I'M SHARING DATA I HAVE NOT HEARD ANY SUBSTANTIAL SUSTAINABLE DATA FROM THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN- THAT ONE SB FOUR NINETEEN- TO PASS SO MY QUESTION IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SAFETY AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. UNSKILLED AND UNTRAINED WORKFORCE BUT THERE'S BEEN NO DATA TO PROVE THAT THOSE FOLKS ARE UNSKILLED OR UNSAFE AND THE DEAD THE INFORMATION THAT I PROVIDED YOU TODAY THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR IS ONE OF THE- THE SAFEST SECTORS OUT THERE WE'RE ACTUALLY SAFER THAN REALTORS. WITH THE T. R. I. R. OF POINT EIGHT MOST FOLKS OUT THERE IN THE INFORMATION I PROVIDED WITH YOU PROVIDED YOU TODAY OR FOUR POINT TWO OR BETTER SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME FOLKS THAT WE WANT TO TARGET. AND IF YOU LOOK ON THE PAGE THAT I PROVIDED YOU YOURS ISN'T IN COLOR BUT I CAN SHOW YOU HERE THE ONLY FOLKS THAT ARE IN GREEN THAT MEANS GOOD READ IS DANGER YELLOW IS CAUTION IS YOU'LL AND GAS SECTOR AND I WON A STEP FURTHER AND BROKE OUT JUST THOSE CONTRACTORS. THAT THE GOOD GENTLEMAN SAID EARLIER IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR ONE NINE THAT ACTUALLY THESE FOLKS ARE COMING FROM OUT OF STATE THAT IS FALSE ALL THE CONTRACTORS THAT SB FOUR ONE NINE IT'S GONNA TARGET ONLY ONE COMPANY HAS LESS THAN A 100% WORKING LIVING AND RAISING THEIR KIDS RIGHT HERE. IN KERN COUNTY OR ACTUALLY IN KERN COUNTY WHERE I'M FROM THERE 98% ALL OTHER CONTRACTORS A 100% FROM THERE WE HAVE AN AGGREGATE T. R. I. R. OF THE POINT THREE. THERE'S NO OTHER SECTOR OUT THERE THAT IS BETTER THAN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR NEXT CONTRACTORS WORKING IN THIS AND THIS BILL IS GOING TO TARGET MY WANT TO READ AND. CLOSE WITH THIS THERE'S A PUT UP. THE BILL THAT SAID SKILL JOURNEY. MEAN THE WORK WHO MAY BOWL THE PHONE CREDITS YOUR ONE OR BOTH. THE WORKER EITHER. OR HE HAS ENOUGH TIME OUT THERE IN THE FIELD SO THIS BILL SAYS YOUR UNSKILLED AND UNTRAINED TODAY. BUT WHEN THIS BILL COMES INTO EFFECT BOOM. YOU'RE NOW SKILLED AND TRAINED.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON THE LONG FLOOR ANY. COMMENTS SOME REWARD THANK YOU VERY IN THE SPORT IS CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND AND I SUPPORT THE INTENT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO RAISE THAT STANDARD FOR FOUR WEEKS BACK- I'M CURIOUS ANNIE AND ANALYSIS- SB FIFTY FOUR- BYE CENTER HANCOCK THEN- CHAT ESTABLISHED SKILLED AND TRAINED AND FOR OIL REFINERIES AND- OR IF- IF SOMEBODY FROM THE BUILDING TRADES ALSO- WERE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT EITHER THE AUTHOR SO HOW DOES THIS GO ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT IS A SOUND SORT OF. OTHER OTHER WORK WORKPLACE OF OTHER WORK SITES. SPECIFICALLY WHAT WILL SITES- PIPELINE INFRASTRUCTURE THE FEEDING LINES IN- THIS KIND OF PLUGGING AND ABANDONING JOBS A LOT OF THAT THE WELL WILL HEAD IN THAT SITE WORK AS OPPOSED TO THE REFINING WORKS ON EXTRACTIVE SIDES WE AND WHAT IS WHAT AND WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE OIL REFINERIES IT'S NOT THAT WE ALL OF A SUDDEN GOT PEOPLE FROM OUT OF STATE CUNNINGHAM OR EVERYONE LOST THEIR JOB RIGHT EVERYBODY RAISED UP TO THE STANDARD THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR FOR LABOR IN CALIFORNIA. YEAH I THINK I THINK SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION. THEY WERE REYES ONE FIFTY FOUR WAS BEING WITH PUT FORWARD BUT THE- THE- BOTH THE APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS THAT WERE PROMULGATED AND THEN. YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL CONTRACTING ACTIVITY THAT OCCURRED AFTERWARDS DIDN'T. PUT A BUNCH OF PEOPLE OUT OF WORK RIGHT SO- I DON'T KNOW IF. YEAH I DON'T TO. GO TOO DEEP IF THE COMMITTEE OESN'T WANT TO GO THAT DEEP BUT I I'M SURE MR MILLER HAS. AN INSIGHT ON X. EXPERIENCE AND HOW IT SORT OF PLAYED OUT IN PRACTICE BUT- YEAH I SHOULD JUST NOTE I WAS GONNA SAY THAT MY OPENING. SO MEMBER BUT- THE AMENDMENTS WE COMMITTED TO ON THE FLOOR WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO IT I DIDN'T QUITE SUMMARIZE THOSE OFF FOR YOU IN THE COMMITTEE BUT WE DO PUSH OUT THE- START DATE OF THE BILL AS WELL TO TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. OKAY SO. THE JUST TO BE CLEAR AND I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK ON MY WORD OR M. CONCERN ANY OPPOSITION WE'RE NOT CHANGING THAT COMMITMENT IT ALSO. IT DOES START IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. I'M NOT TWENTY TWO WE JUST HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO GET AUTHORS IMMENSELY AND SORT OF FIGURE THAT OUT WITH CAMILLA OKAY. GIVE EXISTING EMPLOYEE EMPLOYEES THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE ABLE TO MEET THAT STANDARD EXACTLY HAVE TRANSITION DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME AND FRANKLY IT MEANS THAT THE SKILL JOURNEY PERSON ANGLE IN. ALLOWS FOLKS NOT TO BE SKILLED AND TRAINED RIGHT AWAY AND HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THAT THEY CAN GET CREDIT FOR PAST HOURS WORKED IN THE INDUSTRY EXCELLENT SO. THAT SHOULD THAT SHOULD SOLVE ALL WELL DOCTOR NOT APPRECIATE HIS THERE'S A MOTION AND SECOND SOME HAPPY TO THINK WHAT THE BILL THAT I THINK. THANK YOU. THIS ARE YOU. CALLING ME YES OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. SO SORRY I WAS LATE TO THE PARTY HERE- BUT- I'M STRUGGLING WITH HIS BILL AND THE REASON I'M STRUGGLING WITH IT IS BECAUSE THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A PROBLEM IN FACT THERE SEEMS TO BE THE OPPOSITE OF THE PROBLEM IN THIS PARTICULAR FIELD IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA- THE PEOPLE THEY'RE WORKING THEY'RE HAPPY- THE- THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A SAFETY ISSUE IN FACT JUST THE OPPOSITE THEY'RE SAFER THAN ANY OTHER INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA BASICALLY- WERE. THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL. TO DISPLACE WORKERS THAT WE AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY HAVE BEEN ALL ABOUT TRYING TO HELP. IN THE LAST YOU KNOW THE FROM SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE AND- SEVEN MONTHS THAT'S ALL I'VE HEARD IS WE'VE GOT TO HELP PEOPLE THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY BEING AFFECTED BY. YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT IS HEARING IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS THAT WE'RE DOING- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RECIDIVISM AND YET WE HAVE. AB 830% POPULATION WHERE PEOPLE THAT USED TO BE IN PRISON CAN ACTUALLY GO. GET A JOB. AND ACTUALLY. TAKE CARE OF THEIR LIVES. REYES FAMILIES GET STRAIGHT N. AND STAY THAT WAY- MINORITY POPULATIONS WHO ORDINARILY MIGHT NOT HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE WELL PAYING JOBS. AND HEALTH CARE BENEFITS AND SEND THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL AND WATCHING GRADUATE WITHOUT HAVING- LOANS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. THIS SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO FOR THEM TO DO THAT SO I'M KIND OF CURIOUS WHY WE'RE EVEN GOING THERE WITH THIS PARTICULAR SECTOR IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA. BECAUSE THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A SAFETY ISSUE AND IF THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. WHY. IF A MANAGER JUST VERY BRIEFLY- I DO THINK WE HAD SAFETY ISSUES I WOULDN'T I THINK WE'VE WE'VE LOST LIFE- IN OUR PIPELINE SYSTEM- I KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE INDUSTRY WIDE DATA BUT YOU KNOW I WENT THROUGH THE EARLY SO CANYON GHASTLY CAN HAD TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE POISON IN MY BACKYARD AND PEOPLE ARE STILL DEALING WITH ALL KINDS OF INCIDENTS FROM- INADEQUATE MAINTENANCE- AND A LACK OF COMMITMENT ON THE SAFETY SIDE SO AND I THINK THE CONSEQUENCES ARE REAL AND- THAT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU'RE SUBCONTRACTING OUT AND YOU'RE NOT USING YOUR NOT PAYING PEOPLE PREVAILING WAGE. WHICH YOU CAN HEAR FROM THE GOOD TESTIMONY OF FOLKS WHO ARE PAYING PAYING THOSE WAGES BUT THERE'S A LOT OF SUB STANDARD- PAYMENTS GOING ON OUT THERE AND SO- IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT- WE'RE SEEKING A PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SORT IT UP LIFT ALL THOSE SEVENTEEN THOUSAND WORKERS IT'S NOT NOT TRYING TO SEND AN INDUSTRY ELSEWHERE WE'VE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT THE TURNAROUND JOBS COMING IN FROM OUT OF STATE AND WE'RE WORRIED THAT AMONG SO SEVENTEEN THOUSAND IF THEY DON'T HAVE STABLE EMPLOYMENT AND THEY'RE GONNA SUBCONTRACTED JOB TO JOB AND THEY'RE NOT BEING PRIVY TO PAY PREVAILING WAGE DRIVE ACCESS TO LONG TERM BENEFITS OR PENSION OR RETIREMENT. THEN THEY'RE GOING TO THEY'RE GOING TO RISE AND FALL DEPENDING ON WHAT OPEC OR PUTIN DOES AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S A SAFE WAY TO SET THAT WHOLE SECTOR WORKERS UP FOR SUCCESS SO THIS IS THIS IS REALLY SUPPOSED TO STABILIZE- MAN ASSIST. NOT NOT TO BE- AN IMPEDIMENT. IF YOU'RE- THANK YOU THANK. YES KEEP HER BRING IT FOR IT I THINK M. YOU SAID EXACT WHAT I UNDERSTOOD THE PURPOSE OF OUR PORTIONS OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL TO BE AND THAT IS- TO UP LIFT A GROUP OF WORKERS WHO MAY NOT HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR APPRENTICESHIPS OR TRAINING IN THE PAST TO BE ABLE THEN OVER THIS PERIOD TIME TO GET THOSE AND THAT DOES HELP ACTUALLY NOT JUST WITH THESE WORKERS BUT- AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO A JUST TRANSITION. IF WE LOOK AT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO A WORK FORCE AS SOME OF THESE JOBS. MAY BE PHASED OUT AND WHERE THEY GO AND BE HAVING THAT ADDITIONAL TRAINING SOME OF THEM WHAT WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL TRAINING PROBABLY HAVING THAT- EXPERIENCE THAT CONNECTION- QUITE FRANKLY TO A LARGER WORK FORCE THAT THAT WE WILL THEN HAVE TO UP THE STANDARD OF- OF JOBS FOR ALL OF THESE FOLKS I THINK THAT'S A POSITIVE THING AND JUST LIKE IN CONSTRUCTION- WE OFTEN HEAR FROM FOLKS WHO WHO SAY WELL THIS IS GOING TO DISPLACE THE WORKERS KNOW IT'S GOING TO DISPLACE THE PROFITS OF THE SUBCONTRACTOR. WHO WASN'T PREVIOUSLY PAIN- THE WORKERS ALL THE WORKERS SOMETIMES YES WE HAVE YOU KNOW GOOD CONTRACTORS ABOUT CONTRACTORS BUT BUT THIS WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE SUBCONTRACTED WORKERS ARE ACTUALLY PAID- APPROPRIATELY WITH BENEFITS AND HAVE THE TRAINING IN ORDER FOR THEM TO SUCCEED NOT ONLY IN THIS- JOB BUT ANY FUTURE JOB THAT MAY. BE WHAT WE'RE TRANSITIONING TO SO THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL. I THINK IT. AND THANK YOU AND I HAVE TO SAY THE SAME CONCERN AND ABSTRACT TO TALK TO SOME OF THE WORKERS- ON AS SOON AND I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT MR TAYLOR MELINA VALDEZ OR IN OUR PACKET THAT DOWN THAT THEY DON'T LOSE YOUR JOB IN KERN COUNTY IS REALLY IMPORTANT- THAT WE DO THAT AS I CALLED THE PROPONENTS OF THIS- WHO ARE PART OF THE ELECTRICAL WORKERS. A PLUMBER'S STEAM FITTERS IRONWORKERS LABOR'S PIPEFITTERS. UTILITY WORKERS OPERATING ENGINEERS CARPENTERS SHEET METAL WORKERS. JUST TO NAME A FEW. THAT THEY COULD TRANSITION AND COULD THAT WAS THE QUESTION I ASKED. EACH OF THESE. ENTITIES COULD WE TRANSITION THEM OVER- AND STILL WORK IN THE OFFICE BUT TRANSITION INTO THESE TYPE OF SKILLS AND IS A WAY TO DO IT. IN FACT THEY SAID. MONEY OFF SHORT SIDE THEY WERE. THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THE SAME THING AND I WANT TO DO THE SAME THING. AND IN LINE IN ON SHORE AND SO WITH THE WITH THE GUARANTEE AND THE BEST A GUARANTEE YOU CAN GET. THAT NO ONE WOULD LOSE THEIR JOB- I'M GOING TO MOVE FORWARD AND VOTE FOR THIS CADETS. FOR ME THAT IS AND I THINK WITH EVERYBODY BACK FROM SPEAK FOR EVERYBODY ON THIS COMMITTEE. THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT THAT- NO ONE LOSES A JOB A HOUSE THE KANSEN THEIR KIDS TO COLLEGE ALL OF THAT IS REALLY REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. AND SO- WITH ADAM MOCO HEAD BOTH FOR TODAY AND THEN. HOPEFULLY IT'LL WORK OUT YOU KNOW JUST SOME LAG TIME. WE GOT TO GET THEM INTO APPRENTICESHIPS AND- AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE- LET'S GIVE THEM THAT TIME BECAUSE THAT IT AT THE END OF THE DAY- EACH OF THE SKILL SETS. IN EACH OF THESE ARM TRADE UNIONS. THEY WANT THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN. AS PART OF THEIR UNIONS I. IS NOT LIKE THEY WANT TO THROW THEM AWAY IMPACT. AS A MEMBER OF A UNION THAT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF HOW GENES WORK WE WANT TO BRING IN EVERYBODY IN. UNDER ONE TENT ITSELF THANK. YOU THANK YOU AND YES I HAVE SEEN SOME OF THE WORK THAT THE SENATORS AND PUTTING IT IN TERMS OF. MAKING SOME MODIFICATIONS AND WORK WITH OPPOSITION ON THAT. ESPECIALLY ON THE TIMELINE. OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS DO PASS NATURAL RESOURCES WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE UNDER START. I APPRECIATE- DEPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES REMARKS- FROM THE SET THE SOUTHERN PART L. A. AND YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T JUST A KERN COUNTY ISSUE THIS IS OUR BACKYARD ISSUE TOO I KNOW YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT IN A LOT OF PARTS OF THE STATE BUT YOU DO HAVE MY COMMITMENT THERE AND I MADE THAT SAME COMMITMENT TO ALL MY COLLEAGUES LIVE ON THE FLOOR AS WELL SO- YET THIS IS NOT- NOT SUPPOSED TO BE PUTTING ANYONE OUT OF WORK IS SUPPOSED TO BE UPLIFTING EVERYONE IN WORK AND MAKE THIS WHOLE ECONOMY NOT SO VOLATILE MORE DURABLE SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY RAISE A FAMILY IS AND NOT WORRY IF YOUR JOB IS GOING TO GO AWAY. YOUR TO THE NEXT SO- WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. PHONE THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER FOR MANUFACTURING CAN CALL THE ROLL MOTION IS TO PASS TO NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE KALRA HI KALRA I FLOOR GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I JONES SAWYER FIVE TUNES WERE IRATE. REYES ICE SAILOR. NO THERE ARE NO. WORDS WORD I DON'T THINK SO DOUBLES UP. SB SIX SIX FIVE AUBURN MONA. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. RIGHT THANK YOU GOT. SHARE I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO HAT WHEN THE GOING IN YOUR FAVOR YOU DON'T TALK HER OUT OF IT SO- THANK YOU A COUPLE COUPLE COMMENTS THIS IS THE BILL'S BEEN SUPPORTED BEFORE IT'S MUCH. LESS BROADENED IN ITS IN ITS- COVERAGE I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR THOUGH PERSONALLY AND I THINK OF MEGAN LANE FOR THEIR WORK THAT YOUR WORK ON THIS AT SOME. THREATENS PERSONAL SAFETY BECAUSE SEVERAL TIMES WE TALK ABOUT WHEN YOU WERE ON THE WHEN YOU WERE DRIVING. ON BLUETOOTH THAT'S RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR RISKING YOUR LIFE FOR THIS BILL- THE LET ME JUST DESCRIBE THE CONSTRAINT THE BILL DOESN'T PROVIDE THE- PREFERENCE FOR VETERANS- BY PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYERS- ANALOGOUS TO WHAT. PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYERS CAN DO IN THE FIFTY STATES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- THERE'S A SUNSET IT WAS REDUCE FROM SEVEN TO SIX YEARS. THERE'S ALSO PROVISION AS IS CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE THAT THOSE WHO WERE DISCHARGED FROM THE MILITARY ON THE BASIS OF THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION BE CONSIDERED VETERANS FOR ALL PURPOSES THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN HONORABLY DISCHARGED- TODAY. AND ALSO REQUIRES EMPLOYERS BUT PROVIDE A PLAN- THERE'S ANOTHER AMENDMENT THAT WE HAVE WORKED ON AS RECENTLY AS TWO DAY. THAT WE TAKEN VETERANS COMMITTEE- WITH RESPECT TO ENSURING THAT. THERE'S NOT DISPARATE IMPACT AMONG THOSE WHO ARE PROTECTED CLASSES WHO ARE VETERANS AND PURPOSES SO THAT IF SOMEONE USES AS A SUBTERFUGE FOR EXAMPLE JUST TO HIRE. BOB WHITE VETERANS TO USE AN EXAMPLE THAT THAT IS IN VIOLATION OF BOTH FIANNA VIOLATION OF BOTH PURPOSE INTENT OF THIS BILL. SO HAVING SAID THAT I WOULD URGE MY VOTE I ALSO HAVE. ON THE LINE- AS WITNESS. WE HAVE- MISTER MICHAEL CALLED WHO WILL TESTIFY IN BRIEF THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH OF WITNESSES UP. TO TWO MINUTES WE HAVE MICHAEL CALLED ON THE PHONE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR KALRA NUMBERS MY NAME IS MICHAEL CALL APPEARING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY FOR HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND ITS AFFILIATES THE SOCIETY FOR HUMAN ESOURCE MANAGEMENT. WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR AND SUPPORT SB SIX SIX FIVE WE WANT TO THANK CHAIR KALRA AND MEMBERS LARA CAN DOLLARS JONES SAWYER AND GóMEZ REYES FOR YOUR PRIOR SUPPORT OF THE SAME BILL IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR RENEWED SUPPORT TODAY. EVERYONE WANTS TO THANK VETERANS FOR THEIR SERVICE. SB SIX SIX FIVE WOULD GO BEYOND THE VERBAL THANK YOU AND ONE MATERIALLY ASSISTS VETERANS AND FINDING GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT WHICH IS CRUCIAL TO THE VETERANS LONG TERM ECONOMIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFIT. MANY EMPLOYERS HAVE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN ACTIVELY RECRUITING. VETERANS BUT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LAWSUIT. ACCORDINGLY AT THE SIX SIX FIVE WOULD ENABLE EMPLOYERS WHO WISH TO PROVIDE INVOLUNTARY HIRING PREFERENCE TO DO SO. PROVIDED THEY ADHERE TO SB SIX SIX FIVE REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE IS NOT USED IN AN IMPROPER MANNER. SUCH A VOLUNTARY HIRING PREFERENCES ENTIRELY LAWFUL OVER FORTY STATES WHAT THE RED BLUE AND PURPLE HAVE ENACTED SUCH PREFERENCES. ALWAYS OVERWHELMINGLY AND OFTEN UNANIMOUSLY. IS ALSO CONSISTENT CALIFORNIA LAW WHICH ALLOWS THE TIRING PREFERENCES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. INDEED CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAVE A PREFERENCE PROVISION FOR PRIVATE EMPLOYERS AND SB SIX SIX FIVE SIMPLY MODERNIZE THIS PREFERENCE TO BE USED FOR VETERANS WHO SERVED AFTER THE VIETNAM WAR. BEYOND BEING LAWFUL IS FAIR. VETERANS BRING UNIQUE SKILL SETS THAT RENDER THEM QUALIFIED FOR THE POSITION THEY SPEAK. EVEN IF THE RESUMES PROPS LOOK DIFFERENT THAN THOSE WHO TOOK A MORE TRADITIONAL ROUTE. TO THE EXTENT OF HE TIE BETWEEN CANDIDATES IS NOT UNFAIR FOR EMPLOYERS TO BREAK THAT TIE IN FAVOR THOSE WHO ELECTED TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY. AND DELAYED THERE PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT CAREERS. LASTLY IS NOT DISCRIMINATORY SB SIX SIX FIVE INCLUDES NUMEROUS PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE CANNOT BE USED TO INTENTIONALLY DISCRIMINATE. AGAINST A PROTECTED GROUP. SB SIX SIX FIVE OPPONENTS WILL EXPRESS CONCERN ABOUT A POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATORY IMPACT. RESPECTFULLY THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF ANY SUCH UNFAIR IMPACT IN THE FORTY STATE TO RECENTLY ENACTED SUCH PREFERENCE PROVISIONS. MOREOVER AN UNFAIR IMPACTED INCREASINGLY UNLIKELY SINCE THE CURRENT MILITARY FIGHT VERY DIVERSE. WITH MEMBERS OF PROTECTED GROUPS THANKS LITTER THE. HIGH RATE AND POPULATION. AND WE HAVE A WEEKLY THING YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND WE PATRONIZED THANK YOU THANK FOR SHARING. ANYONE ELSE IS. THE IN THE- WILL GO TO RIPPLE TESTIMONY. AND THEN WE'LL GO TO THE PHONE ANYONE IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX SIX FIVE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF SB SIX SIX FIVE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. ONE AND THEN ZERO APPEARANCE SUPPORT OF SB. SIX SIX FIVE. AND ONE MOMENT WE HAVE ONE IN Q. AND AGAIN WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX SIX FIVE. YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. ANDREA ABOUT HER LINE OF EIGHTY FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THE MAN CARE NUMBERS KELLY MAY DOUGLAS WITH DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER SUPPORT QUEUE AT TIME THANK YOU SO MUCH WILL MOVE ON TO OPPOSITION I KNOW ON THE PHONE WE HAVE TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE UP TO TWO MINUTES MAXIMUM EACH AND WE HAVE KEVIN BAKER. AND JENNY- PEYSER SO KEVIN- BAKER FOR THEIR YOU MAY BEGIN. YES GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS KEVIN BAKER DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR IS HERE YOU CALIFORNIA ACTION. INTEREST OF TIME I'M ALSO TESTIFYING TODAY ON BEHALF OF COALITION OF CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS REFLECTED IN THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS. ANOTHER ORGANISER TO OPPOSITION OF DONE A LOT OF BAD BECAUSE HE ON BEHALF VETERANS OVER MANY YEARS. AND WE PLUG THE AUTHORS KOLEJE ADVANCING OPPORTUNITIES VETERANS. BUT IT DOES NOT UNDER VETERANS TO PRACTICE DISCRIMINATION IN THEIR NAME. NOR. IS IT NECESSARY TO DO SO. VETERANS AGENDA HIGH SKILLED AND WELL QUALIFIED JOB APPLICANTS. MANY OF WHOM LIKE SENATOR ROBERT HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR CAREERS IN THE MILITARY. THEY ARE PROTECTED AGAINST DISCRIMINATION AND THE PARENT ONE HOUSING ACT. AND THEY DO NOT NEED A LIFE LONG HIRING OR RETENTION PREFERENCE TO PLACE THEM IN JOBS THAT THEY CAN'T OTHERWISE COMPETE FOR ON THEIR MERITS. ANYMORE THAN SYNDROME BURKE. CALL THIS UNITS AT THE BILL COULD GO FORWARD AND STILL ACCOMPLISH THE AUTHORS OBJECTED WITH ONE SMALL BUT IMPORTANT MEANT. TO SIMPLY NOT ALLOW DISPARATE IMPACT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST OTHER PROTECTED CLASSES. THE PROHIBITION AGAINST DISCORDANT ACTIVE BEEN THE CONSISTENT POOL OF OUR CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS FROM THE BEGINNING. NEVER BEEN AN EXCEPTION IN FACT EXISTING LAW PROHIBITS DISCORDANT BACK DISCRIMINATION AGAINST VETERANS. ALL REQUESTED AMENDMENT WHICH SIMPLY ALLOW THE GROUP TO HAVE THE SAME PROTECTION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION THAT VETERANS HAVE AND PRESERVE EXISTING LAW. ALREADY UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THEY HAVE OPERATED UNDER THAT RULE FOR DECADES. IT IS FRANKLY MYSTIFYING TO US WHY THE AUTHOR IS NOT EVEN BEING ABLE TO JUST ONE CLARIFYING PRINCIPLE. BEFORE YOU TO HOPE AND COULDN'T BEFORE YOU GO TODAY I HOPE YOU WILL HAVE THE ALL GOOD BACK QUESTIONS AND RESOLVING YOUR OWN LINES WHY CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT MAINTAIN HOW LONGSTANDING AND CONSISTENT DISCRIMINATION PROTECTIONS FOR EVERYONE. JUST AS WE PROTECT VETERANS AGAINST DISCRIMINATION. ALTERNATIVELY IF THERE IS ONE OTHER QUESTION I HOPE YOU WILL ASK. IF YOU CONCLUDE THAT THE CONCERNS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS ARE MISPLACED DESPITE OUR- WORK IN THIS AREA AND OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS FIELD. WHY NOT ALLOW THE BILL TO GO FORWARD FOR SOME REASONABLE THREE YEAR TIME PERIOD FOR EXAMPLE AND HAVE THE DFG H. STUDIED THE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL BEFORE IT BECOMES PERMANENT. IN CLOSING I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS REFLECTED IN ANALYSIS AND ONE DESCRIBED BY FOUNDER ON BURKE. NOT MEANINGFULLY ALTER THE BILL WOULD MITIGATE THE DISPARATE IMPACT ON PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDER REPRESENTED AMONG VETERANS WHICH IS OUR CONCERN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. TWENTY MEASURE. YES GOOD AFTERNOON- JENNIFER PEYSER JUNIOR COUNSELORS LEARNED A LEGAL AND EXPLAINED IN OUR LETTER WE RESPECTFULLY DO OPPOSE THIS BILL I REQUEST TODAY IS THAT YOU HIT PAUSE AND GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE AFFECTED POPULATION BEFORE CHANGING CALIFORNIA LAW THREE POPULATION COULD BE ESPECIALLY BURDEN IF THIS BLL BECOMES LAW JUDGES WERE EMERGING FROM THE COBIT PANDEMIC EITHER WOMEN TRANSGENDER PEOPLE AND PEOPLE LIVING WITH A DISABILITY WOULD SUGGEST AN APPROACH BETTER CALCULATED TO HELP THOSE VETERANS WHO DO NEED HELP. FIRST ABOUT WOMEN THE PANDEMICS ECONOMIC IMPACT HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY SEVERE FOR WOMEN IT INCREASED POVERTY FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND IS EVEN MORE SEVERE HOLDEN OF COLOR BECAUSE THE MILITARY HAS BEEN AND REMAINS OVERWHELMINGLY MALE THIS BILL WOULD WORSEN THE CHALLENGES FOR WOMEN SEEKING TO REENTER THE WORKFORCE NOW ABOUT TRANSGENDER PEOPLE TO LARGEST SURVEY OF TRANSGENDER PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA FOUND THAT ONE THIRD LIVE IN POVERTY ONE THIRD REPORTED BEING HOMELESS IS PREJUDICED AGAINST THEM IF THE POLLING AND PRESIDENT BIDEN ONLY JUST LISTED THE MILITARY'S BAN. IT'S AFFECT WILL DISSIPATE BUT ONLY WITH TIME THIRDS THE MILITARY'S BAN ON SERVICE BY PEOPLE WITH A DISABILITY REMAINS IN PLACE I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO CAN DO AN EXCELLENT JOB DOING ALL SORTS OF THINGS BUT A BARGE MILITARY SERVICE OFTEN FACE UNINFORMED PREJUDICE WHICH IS WHY CALIFORNIA LAW PROTECTS AGAINST DISCRIMINATION LET ME BE CLEAR OF COURSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO APPRECIATE OUR VETERANS BUT THE BETTER WAY IS TO CHECK WITH THEIR NEEDS ARE SOME ARE DOING WELL FOR THOSE WITH NEEDS WHAT WOULD HELP HIRING ADVANTAGE LIKE THIS OR TRAINING FOR THOSE WHOSE MILITARY ROLE WITH LESS SKILLED OR MORE MILITARY SPECIFIC OR OTHER THINGS. AND FOR VETERANS WHO ARE WELL EDUCATED OFFICERS HAVE TRANSFERABLE SKILLS NOT ONLY DO THEY NEED LESS HELP THEY TEND TO BE MORE MALE WHITE STRAIGHT AND NOT TRANSGENDER THEY DON'T NEED ADVANCED AT THE EXPENSE OF THOSE WHO ARE OR HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED OR WHO JOINED THE MILITARY IN FAR FEWER NUMBERS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. RESPECTFULLY INSTEAD OF APPROVING THE STILL PLEASE CALL US AND FOCUS INSTEAD ON HOW TO OUR STATE PEOPLE RECOVER FROM THIS TERRIBLE PANDA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OF THOSE ONE IN THE ROOM WILL GO ON THERE'S NO ONE AT REMOTE STATION. A MODERATOR IN ON THE PHONE. IN OPPOSITION TO SB SIX FIVE. THANK YOU FOR IN OPPOSITION OF SB SIX SIX FIVE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. ONE AND THEN ZERO FEAR IN OPPOSITION ™SB SURE WE HAVE NO ONE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME OKAY- WE HAVE A MOTION. A COMMON QUESTIONS. THIRTY AS A MOTION ON THE TABLE YEAH. THAT'S AFFIRMATIVE COMMENTS YOU FOR BRINGING THIS TO A CENTER AND- I DO HAVE A LOT OF VETERANS IN OUR AREA- YET TO COME BACK AND DO NEED- DO NEED JOBS AND THEY NEED. I THINK THEY NEED THIS BOOST ARE YOU TAKING ANY OTHER CO AUTHORS ON THIS BECAUSE IF YOU ARE I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS COLLATERAL THANK YOU SOMEONE- THIS BILL WILL BE AMENDED SO BE TAKE OFFICE THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU- THANK YOU- THANK YOU CENTER OF. THE NPS. THANK YOU SENATOR- FOR WORKING VERY CLOSE WITH OUR OFFICE AND- WE DID- REQEST IN AND CAME TO AGREEMENT ON A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS INCLUDING. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS REPORTING FROM DIVA DLPH AND- I DO TAKE. SERIOUSLY THE CONCERNS OPPOSITION. I THINK THEY'RE LEGITIMATE I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY- IN A- CAUTIOUS AND I WOULD JUST ASK. THAT YOU. WORK WITH THEM THE BEST ABILITY TO VISIT TO ALLAY THEIR CONCERNS ANOTHER VERY SPECIFIC REQUESTS. THAT ARE IN THERE. AND I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE GOING TO AT LEAST ONE OTHER COMMITTEE- AND SO I WOULD- YOU KNOW- YOU DO HAVE. TO WORK WITH THEM TO UNDERSTAND- THAT THE FEAR IS VERY REAL- BASED UPON- THE DISPARATE IMPACTS THAT DO OCCUR- IN EMPLOYMENT. AND TO THAT- IT'S NOT A UP BUT I MEAN I DON'T. SO IF MONSTER TAKE AS A SLIGHT AT ALL. ON VETERANS QUITE THE OPPOSITE I THINK THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- EVERYONE. INCLUDING VETERANS GETS. TREATED WITH EQUITY AND- WE TRIED TO ADD SOME ELEMENTS TO IMPROVE UPON IT AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVEN'T. NECESSARILY SATISFIED. THE CONCERNS THE OPPOSITES COMPLETELY START ASKING TO CONTINUE. THAT WORK. WITH THE OPPOSITION AND- AS WELL AS- WITH THE TRANSPARENCY IN REPORTING THAT WE- ALREADY HAVE PUT IN PLACE TO SOME EXTENT. SO OF WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE- THANK YOU MISTER. MEMBERS THANK AGAIN FOR YOUR PRO WITH THE BILL- THANK YOU MISTER BAKER FOR THAT SHE OUT. A COUPLE OF THINGS BOB. THERE THERE. THE ARGUMENT THAT THIS IS BASICALLY ILLEGAL- IS REFUTED BY THE FACT THOSE THIRTY NINE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE JUST THE SAME KIND OF PREFERENCE FOR VETERANS FIFTY STATES HAVE THAT PREFERENCE IN THEIR GOVERNMENT AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- I WOULD EXPECT THAT THAT THE FOLKS WHO ARE OPPOSED WOULD SUGGEST WE ROLL BACK THOSE BENEFITS THOSE PROTECTIONS AS WELL THERE'S A DISPARATE IMPACT IN AND THAT UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT SOMETHING WE CAN GET PAST OF THE MILITARY HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF LATINOS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION MILITARY IS A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF AFRICAN AMERICANS. AS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION IN THE MILITARY AS A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF POOR PEOPLE AS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION THERE ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO JOIN THE MILITARY JUST LIKE ME BECAUSE THEY WANTED A COLLEGE EDUCATION AND SO YOU DON'T HAVE MANY PEOPLE FROM NEWPORT BEACH FRANKLY THAT JOIN THE MILITARY YOU DON'T HAVE MANY PEOPLE FROM BEVERLY HILLS THE JOINT MILITARY BUT YOU DO A LOT OF FOLKS IN SANTA ANA THE JOIN THE MILITARY. AND AS SUCH- THIS BILL PROVIDES SEVERAL THINGS ONE IT PROVIDES AN INDUCEMENT BY THE WAY TO JOIN THE MILITARY BUT BUT TO ALSO RECOGNIZE THE SERVICE AND THREE ALLOWS PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYERS TO ALSO BENEFIT JUST LIKE WE DO IN GOVERNMENT BY PROVIDING A PREFERENCE TO VETERANS WITH RESPECT TO A DISABILITIES- IT INDEED IN FACT THERE ARE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO BECOME DISABLED BECAUSE OF THEIR MILITARY SERVICE AND SO I AM SENSE OF THE FACT THAT THE MILITARY IS DISCRIMINATING THE PAST DISCRIMINATE PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. AND WE TRY TO PROVIDE SOME REMEDY TO THAT OF THE REMEDY AT LEAST AN EQUALIZATION BY SAYING THAT THOSE WHO ARE DISCHARGED. ON THE SAME FOOTING AS THOSE WHO ARE HONORABLY DISCHARGED AS VETERANS- THE OPPONENTS WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT THE- BASICALLY THAT THE UNIVERSE OF THOSE ARE ELIGIBLE BE EQUAL BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN AND- YOU KNOW SADLY. WHILE THAT UNIVERSE IS INCREASING DRAMATICALLY WITH RESPECT TO WOMEN IT IT'S NOT CLOSE TO BEING EQUAL- IT'S INCREASED FROM THE TIME I FIRST JOINED THE MILITARY BY PROBABLY THREE HUNDRED PERCENT. BUT THERE'S STILL A LONG WAY TO GO SO HAVING SAID THAT- GINGIVAL. THANK THANK YOU SENATOR OF WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON THE TABLE. OVENS OF MADAM SECRETARY CAN TAKE ROLL ON SB SIX SIXTY FIVE.

WHATEVER YOU KNOW PUT PLEASE- TAKE YOUR TIME PRESENT. THE BILL. WE'LL TALK VERY FAST THANK. HELLO EVERYONE I KNOW IT'S LEADING BEEN HERE FOREVER BUT FOR HAVING ME HERE ALSO ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT TODAY I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH A LOT OF HARD WORK IS THE ALL KNOWING A LOT OF COLLABORATION AND A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS THROUGHOUT THE WEEKS AND MONTHS I THINK WE'RE IN A GOOD PLACE. AND DIED AS OF TODAY I'M ALSO WANTED TO HAVE A LETTER OF SUPPORT FROM THE NATIONAL UNION REPRESENTING ACTORS AND STAGE MANAGED MANAGERS ACTORS EQUITY WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT I WOULD BE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS. REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS AND JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT AN AB FIVE CARVE OUT BUT IT WILL HELP ON THESE COMPANIES COMPLY WITH AB FIVE THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN DEVASTATING AS YOU KNOW. UP TO SEVERAL FACTORS BUT PRIMARILY THROUGH THE PANDEMIC AND SO THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO GIVE THEM A LIFELINE TO STAY OPEN AND CONTINUE TO BE IN OUR COMMUNITIES THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR SMALL NONPROFIT PERFORMING ARTS ORGANIZATIONS WITH BUDGETS UP TO ONE POINT FOUR MILLION. TO APPLY FOR GRANTS PENDING APPROPRIATIONS OF COURSE UNDER THIS PROGRAM THE FOCUS IS ON HELPING THE SMALLEST OF BILLABLE PERFORMING ARTS ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE BY POP COMMUNITY WHICH WAS IMPORTANT TO ME THIS BILL ALSO CREATES AN INFRASTRUCTURE TO HELP WITH PAYROLL PROCESSING SERVICES. ONCE THE PYRAMID STRUCTURE IS ESTABLISHED PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE ABLE TO CUT DOWN. ON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. CAN I WANTED TO SHARE CALL THAT. THERE'S A- STORY TO THIS AND- I KNOW THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TO BENEFIT FROM THESE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS IN PARTICULAR. CHILDREN LIKE MYSELF WHO GREW UP IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES AT A TIME WHERE DRUGS VIOLENCE AND GANGS IS VERY PREVALENT AND I WAS JUST A CREATIVE CHILD HAVING TO BE CREATIVE VERY ENERGETIC AND THE THEATRES REALLY DID GIVE ME AN OUTLET TO EXPRESS AND BE ABLE TO DO POSITIVE THINGS. AND SO THROUGH THE PERFORMING THAT I DID FOR SEVERAL YEARS INVOLUNTARY ISN'T I WAS ABLE TO SEE FIRSTHAND JUST HOW BENEFICIAL THEY ARE TO OUR COMMUNITIES I WAS AROUND WHEN POSSIBLE SETTLED FEDERAL STARTED IN BOYLE HEIGHTS NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AGO. AND I DID SEE FIRSTHAND HOW THE EMBRACED. PEOPLE WITHOUT EXPERIENCE AND REALLY OPEN THEIR HOUSE TO KIDS THAT WERE SOMEWHAT LOST AND WANTED TO JUST THE PLACE TO BE TO BE CREATIVE. AND ALSO SERVE AS INCUBATORS SOME OF OUR KIDS IN OUR INNER CITY COMMUNITIES NEVER GET THE OPPORTUNITY STEP OTHER MORE AFFLUENT. IT'S DEAD AND STILL THAT GAVE THEM THE PLATFORM AND THE ABILITY TO PRACTICE AND HONE IN THEIR SKILLS AND POTENTIALLY MOVE ONTO BETTER BIGGER THINGS- I WANTED TO ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT THIS IS NOT JUST. ABOUT PERFORMING ARTS BUT IT'S REALLY IS ABOUT EQUITY IN ACCESS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE HISTORICALLY THEATER HAS BEEN USED TO HIGHLIGHT ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE TO CERTAIN COMMUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE IF THE OTHER COMPASS HE NOW USED ARTS THEATER TO REALLY MOBILIZE THE ARM FARMWORKERS AND TO HELP THEM FIGHT FOR BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS. IT IS INDISPUTABLE THAT PERFORMING ARTS GO HAND IN HAND WITH SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE AND SOCIAL SOCIETY NOT ONLY TO EDUCATE FOR REALLY ELEVATOR COMMUNITIES. AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS I CAN'T SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT THE ARTS. ARE DISAPPEARING IN OUR SCHOOLS AND BE THEATERS. AND COMMUNITY NONPROFITS ARE REALLY SUCH A GREAT PARTNER STROLLER SCHOOLS THEY CONTINUE TO INVITE OUR CLASSROOMS IN. GIVE CLASSES IN REALLY EMBRACE THOSE KIDS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE ARTS. AND SO TODAY I HAVE TO INCREDIBLE WITNESSES FIND ME.
