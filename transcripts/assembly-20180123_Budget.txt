THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET ME JUST. FIRST START OFF BY. THANKING THIS COST OF FOR BEING HERE TODAY TO PRESENT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. I DID WANT TO NOTE AND WAS WAS VERY PLEASED TO SEE. THAT SIMILAR TO OUR ASSEMBLY BUDGET BLUEPRINT. THAT THE GOVERNOR DID. FULLY FUND THE RAINY DAY FUND AS WELL AS ADD ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR RESERVES. HE ALSO PROPOSED TO FULLY FUND THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. HE ALSO ARE PRESENTED NEW FUNDING FOR KRIER TECHNICAL EDUCATION SPECIAL EDUCATION. AS WELL IT'S EXPANDING THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES TAX CREDITS THAT WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO SEE THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION THERE. ARE FOR INCREASED CORE OPERATIONS IN THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO STABILIZE AND EXPAND THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE'S ACTIVITIES. ON THIS COSTA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN STERN VICE CHAIR MEMBERS I'M I'VE PREPARED A BRIEF POWER POINT PRESENTATION THAT I'D LIKE TO PRESENT TO THE COMMITTEE. OF WITH. JUST REALLY THE HIGH LEVEL IN MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. BEFORE YOU START ABOUT THIS BUDGET I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO LOOK BACK IN THE PAST ON WITH CUTS MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN. AT THAT TIME WE ELIMINATED A TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET PROBLEM AND A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL SHORTFALL. AND THE BUDGET HAS BEEN BALANCED AND WE'VE ENACTED ON TIME HOW FOR SEVEN STRAIGHT YEARS. SO. BY ANY MEASURE ARE PROPOSED BUDGET IS A GOOD BUDGET ON ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO OUR PREVIOUS AYE BUDGET DIFFICULTIES. WE ARE PROJECTING A ONE TIME SURPLUS OF SIX POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS WHICH INCLUDES ROUGHLY FOUR POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN INCREASED REVENUES OUT SINCE THE BUDGET ACT PROJECTIONS. WE PROPOSE AT MEETING THE CONSTITUTIONAL TARGET OF THE RAINY DAY FUND IS THE CHAIR MENTIONS. AND ALSO WITH INCREASED REVENUE. WERE DRIVING ON SOME HIGHER EXPENDITURES IN THE POP NINETY EIGHT SIDE OF THE EQUATION ANA AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES PROPOSE I THREE BILLION IN LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA DOLLARS AS THE CHAIR OF THE TO TO. ARE BRINGING IT TO FULLY FUNDED TWO YEARS EARLIER THAN WE HAD PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED. WE ALSO PROPOSED THE CREATION OF A NEW ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE I'LL GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT THAT LATER IN REFERENCED WE ARE PROPOSING THAT CALIFORNIA COMPETE PROGRAM FOR A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. ANNUALLY OVER FIVE YEARS AND AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AS SPECIFICALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE. ADDITIONALLY WERE PROPOSING RECONFIGURING I'M ARE HIRING TAX CREDITS. AT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. I'M SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TO THOSE WITH BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT. LASTLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. PROPOSES. FOUR POINT SIX BILLION IN ADDITION TO THE CURRENT YEAR FUNDING IN SB ONE FUNDING FOR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. BRINGING. TOTAL FUNDING FOR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS TO SEVEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. HOWEVER WE STILL HAVE A MANY UNCERTAINTIES ON THE HORIZON. WE ARE STILL AND AS OF OUR BUDGET. PUBLICATION INTERNAL DEADLINES WE WERE NOT ABLE TO INCORPORATE A THE FEDERAL I TAX REFORM PROVISIONS THAT WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR DOT THROUGHOUT MAY REVISE. ON HOWEVER I THINK LARGELY AT SOME OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FEDERAL TAX REFORM WILL REMAIN UNKNOWN TO US. ON WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT IT WILL IMPACT INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER BEHAVIOR TO WHAT DEGREE LARGELY UNKNOWN AS PEOPLE FILE UNTIL TWENTY NINETEEN. ADDITIONAL THERE WILL BE SOME LARGER ECONOMIC IMPACTS. WE'VE FRANKLY MAY NOT KNOW A WITHIN THE TIMEFRAME OF THIS BUDGET THOSE MAYBE MORE LONG TERM IMPLICATIONS. I WE DID GET GOOD NEWS YESTERDAY. WITCHES THAT CHIP WAS REAUTHORIZED AND SO WE WILL ADJUST. IN THE MAY REVISE OBVIOUSLY DOT. REIMBURSEMENT RATE WOULD HAVE HAD MAJOR IMPACTS ON OUR BUDGET SO THAT WAS A BIT OF GOOD NEWS COMING OUT OF DC YESTERDAY. WE WILL STILL BE MONITORING THOUGH. ANY BUDGET. HUH. ANY OF THE FEDERAL BUDGET. DEVELOPMENTS. I THINK ONE OF OUR CONCERNS IS THAT AT THE TALK ABOUT FEDERAL BELT TIGHTENING. FREQUENTLY THAT TRANSLATES INTO A CAUTIOUS TO STATES SO WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT PROCESS. AND LASTLY OF THE GOVERNOR NOTED DURING THE PRESS CONFERENCE AND AS WE'VE NOTED IN SEVERAL OF OUR PUBLICATIONS. A WERE ALWAYS COGNIZANT OF THE NEXT RECESSION AND SELL PART OF OUR OVERALL ARCHITECTURE WAS TO REALLY BUILD A ROBUST RESERVE. A IN ANTICIPATION OF THAT NEXT RECESSION. LASTLY OBVIOUSLY WE'VE HAD A SERIES OF NATURAL DISASTERS IN THE STATE. ON INCLUDING MUD SLIDES WILDFIRES IMPORTANT NOT OUR THING AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SO YOU'LL SEE THAT IN ADDITION TO THE RAINY DAY FUND WE'VE INCLUDED A HEALTHY DEPOSIT IN THE STATE FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY TO HELP US PAY FOR SOME OF THOSE. UNANTICIPATED EMERGENCY RIPOFF RESPONSE COSTS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET FORECASTS WE STILL ARE SEEMING ECONOMIC GROWTH HOWEVER WE WOULD CAUTION THAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY MARK. ON IT WOULD MATCH THE LONGEST ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN STATE HISTORY POST WORLD WAR TWO WE WOULD BE ON PAR WITH THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE. A WHICH IS AGAIN WHY% WE'RE STILL CAUTIOUS ABOUT AT THE POTENTIAL OF A RECESSION OR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. WE DID INCLUDE A AYE RECESSION SCENARIO IN OUR. BUDGET DOCUMENTATION I BELIEVE THE ANALYST IT AS WELL. AND IN OUR RECESSION SCENARIO WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT. DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR A TOTAL OF SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS ACROSS THREE FISCAL YEARS. AS NOTED WE ARE PROPOSING FILLING UP AT THE CONSTITUTIONAL TARGET OF TEN PERCENT OF REVENUES IN THE RAINY DAY FUND. UP ON THE NATURAL UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF PROPOSITION TWO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE REQUIRED WERE PROPOSING A SUPPLEMENTAL DEPOSIT OF THREE POINT FIVE BILLION WHICH WOULD BRING OUT THE TOTAL FINE. TO THE THIRTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR FIGURE YOU SEE THERE. ADDITIONALLY WE PROPOSE TWO POINT THREE BILLION IN THE LAST DAY FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND AS I SAID PREVIOUSLY THAT STILL WITH WILDFIRES NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER UNANTICIPATED COSTS THAT WE MAY ENCOUNTER. AND ALTHOUGH PROP TWO HOUSE LARGELY HELPED US REDUCE SOME OF OUR DEBTS ON IN IN RECENT HISTORY WE HAVE TACKLED SOME OF OUR UNFUNDED LIABILITIES. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE THE WALL DEBT FROM THIRTY FIVE BILLION TO LASSEN SIX BILLION. ADDITIONAL WE HAVE PLANS TO PAY DOWN. ALL OF THE MAJOR STATE RETIREMENT RELATED LIABILITIES. UP WE STILL DO HAVE SOME OF THESE COSTS AND SO AGAIN OUR ARCHITECTURE IS TO KEEP AND ABOUT THE ONGOING EXPENDITURES VERY LIMITED TO GIVE US FLEXIBILITY TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THESE ONGOING HOW LIABILITIES. I HEAR YOU SEE HISTORIC CHART OF OR PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING AND YOU CAN SEE SENSE I TWENTY ELEVEN BUT I GUARANTEE HAS INCREASED BY SIXTY SIX PERCENT. OUR CAREER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE IS UP BY SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION. AND THE. PROPOSED AMOUNT IN BUDGET YEAR IS SEVENTY EIGHT POINT THREE THAT WOULD BRING OUR PER PUPIL SPENDING TO ELEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN DOLLARS. AS NOTED WE ARE PROPOSING FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA TWO YEARS EARLIER. ADDITION WE HAVE A PROPOSAL FOR TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR CT  <u><c.green>PROGRAMS WE WOULD</c></u> ACTUALLY CONDUCT THE K. TWELVE SIDE OF A CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. IS BUILDING UPON A REASON INVESTMENTS IN THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM WHICH IS BASED ON THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE INNOVATION. AND OPPORTUNITY ACT FUNDING OR WE YALLA. IT'S A REGIONAL APPROACH IN WHICH I REGIONAL CONSORTIUM DECIDES WHAT THOUGH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT NEEDS AREN'T ANY COMMUNITY AND THEY WORK ACROSS SEGMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT TRAINING IS AVAILABLE. TO MEET THOSE REGIONAL NEEDS. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE A SPECIAL EDUCATION PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD INCLUDE A HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD CAPACITY FOR CHILDREN AGES ZERO TO FIVE. AS WELL AS ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I HAD TO EXPAND TEACHER WORKFORCE THROUGH RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING SPECIFICALLY FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS. LASTLY WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WOULD IMPROVE SPECIAL EDUCATION TRANSPARENCY BY ALIGNING THE SUPPLE PLANS WITH THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS TO MAKE SURE THAT. ON THOSE PLANS ARE INFORMING ONE ANOTHER AND AND BEING RELEASED AT THE SAME TIME. IN CHILD CARE WE HAVE A ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR A AND AUGMENTATIONS IN THE CHILDCARE PROGRAM SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN. THIS REPRESENTS THE FINAL YEAR OF AN AGREEMENT WE REACHED FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ON CHILD CARE FUNDING. I HAD THE STATE REIMBURSEMENT RATE WOULD INCREASE. BY TWO POINT EIGHT PERCENT FOR TOTAL FORTY EIGHT MILLION. AND OTHER PERMANENT REGIONAL MARKET RATE WOULD BE HELD HARMLESS. WE HAVE SOME PRETTY MAJOR PROPOSALS AXING THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE A ARENA. THE FIRST IS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING A NEW ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY FOR OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES RIGHT NOW WE USE ENROLLMENT BASED FUNDING TO FUND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND WE'RE PROPOSING A SHIFT TO AN ALLOCATION FORMULA. WHICH WE BELIEVE WOULD PROVIDE MORE STABILITY FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ON THAT EMPLOYMENT FUNDING REALLY DOESN'T ENROLLMENT FUNDING IS OFTEN REALLY TIED TO THE ECONOMIC CYCLE HOA AND OVERALL UNEMPLOYMENT RATES. SOARING NEW ALLOCATION AND. WE PROPOSED A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO HOLD DISTRICTS HARMLESS ON AND MOVING TO THIS NEW ALLOCATION METHOD. IN THE NEW ALLOCATION METHOD WOULD BE BASED FIFTY PERCENT ON ENROLLMENTS TWENTY FIVE PERCENT ON THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS THAT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE SERVES AND WE WOULD DETERMINE THAT DOT THROUGH OUR PROGRAM RECIPIENTS AS WELL AS THOSE RECEIVING THE BARBER THE PROMISE WAIVER. AND THEN THE LAST PORTION OF THE FORMULA BE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF DEGREES OR SEARCH OF COMPLETED WITHIN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WERE ALSO PROPOSING A I HAD THE CREATION OF OUR ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ON THAT WOULD BE BASED AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. WE'RE PROPOSING A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING TWENTY MILLION OF WHICH WOULD BE ONGOING HIGH IT WOULD REQUIRE P. SIGNIFICANT UP FRONT INVESTMENT ON TECHNOLOGY AND TO BUILD OUT THE CURRICULUM. WE ARE AIMING THIS PROPOSAL AT THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WERE WORKING AGE. BETWEEN TWENTY FOUR THIRTY FIVE WHO DO NOT HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE THEY HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA THEY MAY HAVE SOME CREDITS. BUT THEY HAVE NOT ACTUALLY OBTAINED A A COLLEGE DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE AND SO WERE SPECIFICALLY TAILORING IT TO THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO KNOW DURING THE LAST RECESSION THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT DIDN'T HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. WERE IMPACTED DISPROPORTIONATELY IN A JOBLESS RATE AND DURING THE RECOVERY WERE AYE THEY'VE RECOVERED AT A MUCH SLOWER RATE THAN THOSE WITH A HIGHER EDUCATION DEGREE. LASTLY I WE DO PROPOSE HAVE PROVIDING FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT THE AB NINETEEN PROMISE PROGRAM THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. LAST YEAR. AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WE ARE PROPOSING A HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A HOME VISITATION PILOT. THE PILOT WOULD RUN THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THE A DOLLAR AMOUNT IS ACTUALLY ACROSS THOSE THREE YEARS TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THE PILOTS. AND IT WOULD BE TO SUPPORT YOUNG FIRST TIME PARENTS. ADDITIONALLY WE FULLY FUND THE TO YOUR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AGREED TO AS PART OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AND PROP FIFTY SIX THIS INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO CONTINUE THE SECOND YEAR. AND AN EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE. I WOULDN'T KNOW THAT IN THIS PROGRAM. BECAUSE OF THE A CRUEL NATURE WE ARE GOING INTO THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR SO ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATES WE HEADED ACROSS TWO FISCAL YEARS WERE ACTUALLY EXTENDING INTO THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR WE CAN TALK ABOUT ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT LATER IF YOU HAVE. IT'S ABOUT THAT. LASTLY WE ARE PROPOSING AN INCOMPETENT INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL DIVERSION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WE CURRENTLY HAVE OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY INDIVIDUALS. ON THE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL WAIT LIST. AND SO WE'RE PROPOSING A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR LOCAL DIVERSION EFFORTS TO HELP THESE INDIVIDUALS WITH AN ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY FOR LOS ANGELES FOR THIS PURPOSE. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THEY MENTIONED EARLIER OBVIOUSLY WE'VE DEALT WITH SOME SIGNIFICANT NATURAL DISASTERS IN LAST COUPLE MONTHS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE PROPOSE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN PROPERTY TAX BACK FILL FOR THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES IMPACTED BY THE WILDFIRE. AGAIN WITH OUR INTERNAL PUBLICATION DEADLINE WE DID NOT HAVE THE NUMBERS FOR THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILD FIRES OR MUDSLIDES BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES AS WE HEAD TOWARDS THE MAY REVISION. WE JUST IT DIDN'T ALLIED WITH OUR PUBLICATION DEADLINE. ADDITIONALLY WE ARE PROPOSING EXTENDING THE COUNTY ASSESSOR PILOT PROGRAM FOR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. AND LASTLY WE HAVE A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD PROVIDE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR A FIFTY PERCENT LOCAL HOT MATCH GRANT PROGRAM TO REPLACE ELECTIONS EQUIPMENT. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AS I MENTIONED WE ARE EXTENDING THE CAL COMPETES PROGRAM TAX CREDIT FOR A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR FIVE MORE YEARS. WE DO OWE YOU ADDITIONAL DETAIL ON OUR SMALL BUSINESS PROPOSAL FOR TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN DIRECT ASSISTANCE ARE. WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ANALYST IS RAISED ABOUT THIS PROGRAM AS WE HAVE LOOKED AT THIS PROPOSAL. ADDITIONALLY WE'RE RECONSTITUTING OUR STATE WHAT HIRING TAX CREATED A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM WAS NOT UTILIZED THAT WE'D LIKE TO BE CREATED AND THE WAY IN WHICH PEOPLE ACTUALLY UTILIZE IT SO WERE WERE WORKING ON THAT PROPOSAL TO MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE. AS I MENTIONED I SB ONE FUNDING BETWEEN THE CURRENT THE BUDGET YOUR TOTAL SEVEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. ADDITION WE HAVE AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL THAT WOULD RESTART COURT CONSTRUCTION WE WOULD PROVIDE THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE MEDIA AND CRITICAL NEEDS ACCOUNT. AND WE WOULD PROVIDE LEASE REVENUE BONDS FOR TEN COURTHOUSES. WE ALSO HAVE A PROPOSAL FOR A HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. OF WHICH SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE FOR ROOF REPAIRS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE FOR MOLD REMEDIATION. AND THE REMAINDER WOULD BE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY RADIOS AND SPECIFIED VEHICLES. LASTLY WE HAVE INCLUDED A PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD INCLUDE APPROPRIATIONS FOR BOTH THE UPCOMING NATURAL RESOURCES BOND AND HOUSING BOND. IF THOSE BONDS ARE NOT PASSED BY VOTERS THOSE APPROPRIATIONS WOULDN'T GO OUT ON A IT WAS A WAY TO BETTER ALIGN THE TIMING OF IT SINCE. SINCE THE BALLOT DOESN'T NATURALLY ALIGNED WITH OUR BUDGET SO THAT IF THEY WERE. ENACTED BY VOTERS THE MONEY WOULD BE ABLE TO GO OUT SHORTLY THEREAFTER. AS WE SAID OUR PUBLICATION THE CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PLAN IS NOT INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IT WILL BE RELEASED IN CONCERT WITH THE GOVERNOR STATED THE STATE LATER THIS WEEK. WE WOULDN'T OUT THERE'S ONE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF AID OF AVAILABLE FOR EXPENDITURE FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FOUND THAT REPRESENTS THE FORTY PERCENT ALL AVAILABLE FOR EXPENDITURE NOT THE CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS SIDE AT THAT GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. ADDITIONALLY WE PROPOSE FIFTY POINT SIX MILLION ONGOING FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. OF THAT AMOUNT SIX POINT SIX MILLION AS GENERAL FUND. EIGHTEEN MILLION IS FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT AND TWENTY SIX MILLION WOULD BE FROM THE TIRE RECYCLING MANAGEMENT FUND. THESE FUNDS SERVITUDE FULL PURPOSE IT WILL MAKE THE FUND ACTUALLY SOLVE IT WE HAD SOME ISSUES WITH THE DEPARTMENT. AND IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW THEM TO EXPAND SOME OF THEIR EFFORTS INCLUDING IN AREAS SUCH AS CONSERVATION APPROVING HUNTING AND FISHING CONNECTING MORE CALIFORNIANS WITH THE OUTDOORS. AN INCREASING STABILITY AND SERVICES FOR THE PUBLIC INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT. LASTLY DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION RECEIVES ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ALSO UNDER SB ONE THE BUDGET INCLUDES AN INITIAL INVESTMENT OF FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OF THESE FUNDS. OF WHICH FORTY TWO MILLION WOULD BE SPECIFICALLY FOR INCREASING SERVICES ACROSS A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS EMPHASIZING THOSE THAT DIRECTLY BENEFIT PARK PATRONS. LASTLY OUR NOTE OF CAUTION THEY OFTEN USE THIS CHART AND IT'S JUST A REMINDER THAT THE HISTORIC TOWARD TREND IS THAT FREQUENTLY IN CALIFORNIA ARE BALANCED BUDGETS. HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED BY HUGE DEFICITS YOU SEE THE RED LINES WHICH REPRESENT THE DEFICITS FAR OUTNUMBER THE BALLOTS BUDGETS ABOVE THE LINE. AND THAT'S REALLY A KEY COMPONENT OF THE ARCHITECTURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET IS A ROBUST BUDGET STABILIZATION ACT AND AS AFTER YOU TO HELP US WHETHER. THESE HARD TIMES AND I WOULD KNOW IN OUR RECESSION SCENARIO EVEN AT THIRTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION WHICH IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO A PLOT IN THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACT. OR MODERATE RECESSION IS THAT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS SO EVEN THEN THERE WOULD BE SOME DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE MADE SHOULD WE FACE A RECESSION. WITH THAT AND HAPPY. RICHARD ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU I THINK WILL WILL. YEAH I THINK WE'RE GONNA DO IS ON HAVE MAC GOING THE WILL TAKE QUESTIONS. MR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD MORNING. ON JANUARY TWELFTH MY OFFICE PUT OUT OUR OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS WE DO EVERY YEAR TO PROVIDE SOME INITIAL COMMENTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS JUST VERY BRIEFLY PROVIDE SOME HIGHER LEVEL COMMENTS ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. AND LET ME START WITH HIS OVERALL BUDGET STRUCTURE. UP I THINK YOU CAN SEE IN BY MS COSTAS COMMENTS THE GOVERNOR'S VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE ECONOMY TURNS SOUTH NEXT AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S APPROPRIATE. IT CERTAINLY HAS DRIVEN IS BUDGETARY DECISIONS. BY OUR ACCOUNT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT SORT OF DISCRETIONARY MONIES THAT THEY HAD AVAILABLE TO THEM. THE GOVERNOR PUTS ABOUT FOUR FIFTHS OF THAT ARE OVER FOUR FIFTHS OF THAT INTO RESERVES. THAT LEAVES VERY LITTLE LEFT OVER FOR EITHER ONE TIME SPENDING OR ONGOING SPENT. NOW THAT'S A VERY CAUTIOUS APPROACH. IT'S THE MOST CAUTIOUS THING YOU CAN DO BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE YOU NOT SPENDING THEM YOU'RE NOT COMMITTING TO A HIGHER BASELINE THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD. WHEN REVENUES HEAD SOUTH. BUT IT ALSO IS MONEY THAT GOES INTO YOUR RESERVE IT'S A CUSHION THAT HELPS BY YOU TIME. TO DEAL WITH ANY DOWNTURN THAT DOES COM. THE GOVERNOR DOES HAVE SOME ONE TIME SPENDING PRIMARILY ON INFRASTRUCTURE. WHICH WE THINK ARE BROUGH SOME VERY GOOD PROPOSALS. A THAT'S THE NEXT MOST CAUTIOUS THING THAT YOU CAN DO WHILE YOU ARE SPENDING THE MONEY THEY'RE NOT AVAILABLE TO GO ON YOUR RESERVE YOU'RE NOT COMMITTING THEM TO ON ON GOING. A SPENDING. ANY HAS A VERY FEW ONGOING. I COMMITMENTS NOW CLEARLY E. YOUR MAKE DIFFERENT CHOICES. THAT THE CHAIRMANSHIP HIS CLAIM THAT HE PUT OUT IN DECEMBER I THINK IT FOLLOWS BASICALLY THAT SAME OVERALL STRUCTURE THOUGH. THINK ABOUT YOUR RESERVES HOW MUCH YOU WHEN IT'S BEEN FOR ONGOING SUCH AS DATA INFRASTRUCTURE. WHAT YOU HAVE LEFT OVER FROM ONGOING COMMITMENTS SO IT'S IT'S A GOOD WAY TO THINK OVERALL ABOUT THE BUDGET AND THE TRADE OFFS OF DOING? EACH OF THOSE THREE DIFFERENT THINGS. I WOULD SAY THAT THESE ARE VERY GOOD TIMES BUDGETARY ONLY SPEAKING. TAKE A MOMENT TO ENJOY THEM. THAT DOESN'TMEAN THAT YOU SHOULD PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE AS I THINK THIS CASA STRESSED AND IN. HER COMMENTS. NOT ONLY DO YOU WANT TO PREPARE THAT RESERVE YOU WANT TO GET READY PAY OFF DEBTS GET READY FOR THAT NEXT DOWNTURN. BUT YOU DO HAVE OTHER CHALLENGES FACING YOU. WHETHER IT'S POSSIBLE ACTION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ON HEALTH CARE THAT YOU MIGHT WANNA RESPOND TO INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT YOU HAVE. WILL A TALK FOR A MINUTE ABOUT PROP FIFTY FIVE AND DECISIONS THAT COULD AFFECT YOUR FUTURE COMMITMENTS. SO YOU DO HAVE STILL LOTS A CHALLENGES PENSIONS I'M SURE ALL OF YOU ARE HEARING FROM YOUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS FROM YOUR. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABOUT CAL STIRS CALPERS RATES WHAT IT'S DOING TO THEM SO THERE'S STILL LOTS OF CHALLENGES OUT THERE BUT OUT IF THIS IS A GOOD BUDGET YEAR. LET ME TURN REVENUES. AT AS MISS COSTA MENTIONED THEY HAD PUT THEIR BUDGET TOGETHER BEFORE THE EVEN KNEW WHAT WAS THE FINAL ACTION ON. THE FEDERAL TAX LAW. AND EVEN IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED TO FINANCIAL MARKETS SINCE THE TIME THAT THEY SORT OF PUT THEIR BUDGET TO BAD. I THINK THE SNP'S PROBABLY RISEN ANOTHER TEN PERCENT. SO BOTH FINANCING MY OFFICER SORT OF CONSTANT TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH WITH NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN WITH NEW. ECONOMIC DATA. BUT JUST TO A FOR SOME PROSPECTIVE IF YOU GO BACK TO OUR NOVEMBER OUTLOOK THAT WE PRESENTED JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO. OUR REVENUES FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE BUDGET WINDOW. ARE THREE POINT FOUR BILLION HIGHER THAN FINANCES JANUARY BUDGET NUMBERS. AND TO BE CANDID WITH YOU IF WE WERE REDOING THOSE NUMBERS TODAY THEY WOULD PROBABLY BE HIGHER. NOW THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WE RIGHT FINANCES WRONG I THINK WHAT IT DOES SUGGEST THOUGH IS YOU DO YOU HAVE. QUITE A BIT OF UPSIDE ON THE REVENUE NUMBERS WHEN YOU GET TO MAY. AND YOU HAVE TO WAIT TILL MAY. PEPSI WHAT HAPPENS WITH APRIL AND. TO SEE JUST WHERE WE ARE I THINK BOTH OF US WOULD AGREE TO THAT. BUT GIVEN THAT THERE ISI THINK A LOT OF UPSIDE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOUR PLANNING PURPOSES. TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE MORE MONEY. AND THE REASON ANOTHER REASON I RAISE THIS IS BECAUSE THIS SITUATION WE HAVE NOW IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU. FACED IN THE PAST. WHEN YOU HAD EXTRA MONEY. USUALLY A GOOD CHUNK OF THAT HAS TO BE SPENT ON PROP NINETY EIGHT. THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES. AS MUCH AS HALF A NOTS MUCH HAVE AT LEAST HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN SOME YEARS WE REPENT ALMOST EVERY ADDITIONAL DOLLAR IN NEW REVENUES. FOR SOME PORTION OF THAT NEW MONEY TOWARDS NINETY EIGHT. THAT IS NOT THE SITUATION THIS YEAR. YOU DO NOT HAVE WHAT'S CALLED MAINTENANCE FACTOR YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS. CATCH UP THAT YOU'VE HAD TO DO IN THE PAST. SO IF YOU DO HAVE EXTRA MONEY. ALMOST ALL OF IT IS IN EFFECT FREE FOR YES YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS. TO NINETY EIGHT. IN ADDITION PROP TOO WHICH REQUIRES OUR PAYMENTS INTO THE RESERVE AND TO PAY OFF DEBTS. THAT ALSO CAN TAKE A BIG. PIECE OF ANY NEW DOLLAR. ESPECIALLY IF THOSE NEW DOLLARS ARE RELATED TO CAPITAL GAINS THAT'S JUST THE WAY THE PROP TWO FORMULA WORKS. GIVEN THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL TO FULLY FUND THE RESERVE. THAT TOO IS NOT A FACTOR RIGHT NOW. SO I THINK THE POINT I WANT YOU TO WALK AWAY FROM IS IF YOU DO HAVE MORE MONEY WHEN YOU GET TO MAY. IT'S ALMOST ALL DISCRETIONARY MONEY YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT. YOU CAN SPEND MORE ON SCHOOLS IF YOU WANTED YOU COULD PUT IT MORE RESERVES. AT INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT HEALTH ONIONS WHATEVER YOU WANT YOU YOU'RE NOT AS RESTRICTIVE AS YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST. WHEN REVENUES INCREASE BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THE MAY REVISION. I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE FOR YOU SO JUST TAKE THAT INCOME WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT DO. WITH EVEN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IF WE GOT TO MAY. LET ME TALK FOR A SECOND OUR RESERVES. BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO BUT THREE AND A HALF BILLION AN OPTIONAL PAYMENT INTO THE BSA. IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR PLAN AND OBVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR DECISION MAKING. NOW THERE'S REALLY TWO KEY ISSUES FIRST WHAT LEVEL OF RESERVES DO YOU WANT. WHAT WHAT KIND OF RESERVES THE ONE HAVE AT THE END OF THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET YEAR? THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD HAVE MAXED OUT THE THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT OF TEN PERCENT. AND HE ALSO HAS TWO PERCENT IN JUST WHAT WE CALL DISCRETIONARY RESERVES. SO WE HAVE TWELVE PERCENT IN RESERVES THAT'S A LEVEL WE HAVEN'T REACHED IN IN IN MY LIFETIME. ITS A REALLY REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT IF YOU WERE TO BUY HAVE THAT KIND OF LEVEL OF PROTECTION AGAINST ARE ARE VERY VOLATILE REVENUE. SYSTEM. BUT WHAT IS THE RIGHT LEVEL. SOME PEOPLE HAVE ARGUED IT'S A LOT WE SHOULD BE A LOT MORE. IT'S COSTA MENTION THAT 펟 CAN HAVE A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR DOWNTURN PRETTY RAPIDLY. SOME PEOPLE SUGGESTED WE SHOULD HAVE GIVEN OUR REVENUE STRUCTURE. WHICH HAVE A FIFTEEN OR TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE PERCENT RESERVE. NOT THERE'S THERE'S NO RIGHT ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION. IN IN LARGE PART DEPENDS ON YOUR SORT OF PERSONAL PREFERENCES AND AND THE WAY THAT YOU PERCEIVE THINGS DO YOU WANT TO PLAN FOR A MODERATE RECESSION. DO YOU WANT A PLAN FOR THE WORST POSSIBLE RECESSION WHEN DO YOU THINK IT'S COMING. SOON OR THREE OR FOUR YEARS DOWN THE ROAD ALL OF THOSE KIND OF DECISIONS CAN AFFECT WHAT YOU THINK IS THE SORT OF IDEAL RESERVE. I WOULD SAY THAT GETTING TO AT LEAST THE TEN PERCENT BSA MAXIMUM. IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE WOULD BE A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO DO AYE AYE WHAT AT THE MINIMUM TRIED TO ACHIEVE THAT. AND WHETHER YOU GO BEYOND THAT ARE NOT. SORT OF IT HAS TO BE YOUR CALCULUS OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS THAT I DID MENTION. YOU CAN EASILY MAKE THE CASE FOR MORE RESERVES AND IRONICALLY AND THIS I THIS IS VERY COUNTER INTUITIVE. BUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO MAX OUT THE RESERVE TO PUT THE THREE AND A HALF BILLION. COULD ACTUALLY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO BUILD HIGHER RESERVES. AND WE TELL YOU WHY THAT'S THE CASE IF YOU MAX OUT YOUR RESERVE IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE BSA AT TEN PERCENT. WHEN YOU GET TO NINETEEN TWENTY YOU STILL MAY HAVE TO MAKE IN EFFECT PAYMENTS THAT YOU HAVE TO SET ASIDE. FOR RESERVES IN DEBT PAYMENTS HOWEVER INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE BSA. THAT MONEY HAS TO BE SPENT ON CAPITAL OUTLAY. NOW THAT COULD BE A REALLY GOOD THING WE HAVE LOTS OF CAPITAL OUTLAY NEEDS. BUT WHAT IF YOU WANTED TO BUILD YOUR RESERVE A FIFTEEN PERCENT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO MAX OUT THE BSA MEANS THAT IN AT NINETEEN TWENTY FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO SPEND MONEY THAT YOU COULD SET ASIDE FOR ADDITIONAL RESERVES. ON CAPITAL OUTLAY WOULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO BUILD HIGHER RESERVES. I I I'M NOT RAISING THIS TO AN IF IN TO BE NEGATIVE ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. IT'S REALLY MORE JUST TO NOTE THAT BECAUSE OF ALL THE FORMULAS THAT DRIVE YOUR BUDGET. WHETHER IT'S NINETY EIGHT OR PROP TO PROP NOW FIFTY FIVE FIFTY SIX. YOU'RE DECISION MAKING IS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED IT'S MUCH LESS INTUITIVE. WHO'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THESE FORMULAS AND THE WAY THAT THEY INTERACT OFTENTIMES NOT AN INTUITIVE WAYS. SO I MENTIONED THAT IT'S JUST A REALLY SORT OF INTERESTING COMPLETELY COUNTER INTO. INTUITIVE RESULT OF TAKING THE GOVERNOR'S IN GREEN TO GOVERNOR'S ACTION TO MAX OUT YOUR RESERVE IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. LET ME BRIEFLY JUST RAISE A COUPLE OF OTHER ISSUES. PROP FIFTY FIVE. WHICH INCREASED. HIGH INCOME TAX RATES BUT IT ALSO HAS THIS PROVISION THAT BETWEEN ZERO AND TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN ANY HERE COULD BE SET ASIDE FOR. HEALTH BASICALLY MEDI CAL. AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S CALCUL BY THE ADMINISTRATION'S CALCULATION THAT WOULD BE ZERO AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND I THINK THEY'VE TENTATIVELY SUGGESTED THERE MIGHT BE SOME SMALL AMOUNT LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION. THAT WOULD GO TOWARDS MEDI CAL IN NINETEEN TWENTY. THIS IS NOT A REAL INTUITIVE FORMULA THAT PROP FIFTY FIVE REFERENCED. IT'S VERY COMPLICATED. AND WHAT THE MEASURE DID IS BASICALLY GIVE THE ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. PRETTY MUCH FULL DISCRETION TO INTERPRET THAT AS AS. SELF SEAFAIR AT. I THINK THEY MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT BUT I THINK I WOULD JUST SPEND SOME TIME ON THIS INITIAL LOOK AT THE WAY THAT THEY'RE DOING THE PROP FIFTY FIVE CALCULATION. BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE KIND OF BE A PRECEDENT FOR ALL FUTURE CALCULATIONS AND WILL OBVIOUSLY BE LOOKING AT THAT IN. TRYING TO HELP YOU OUT ON THOSE CALCULATIONS. FINALLY EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY BY THE GOVERNORS ACCOUNT FOR. REALLY DISCRETIONARY MATTERS. A ONE EXCEPTION IS EDUCATION. AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S GROWTH THERE BECAUSE REVENUES ARE HIGHER THERE'S GROWTH IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THERE'S GROWTH OVER THE BUDGET YEAR AND IN THE CURRENT YEAR YOU HAD A LOT OF ONE TIME MONIES THAT NOW YOU CAN ALLOCATED THE BUDGET YEAR SO. BY OUR CALCULATION YOU HAVE OVER SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN THE PROP NINETY EIGHT BUDGET THAT TO ALLOCATE. FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES K. TWELVE INCOMMUNICADO ITS PURPOSE. THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE K. TWELVE SIDE IS ALLOCATING VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEIR SHARE IN WAYS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS. A APPROVED OF IN THE PAST AND THAT'S FULLY FUNDING THE LCF AT. AND GIVING A LARGE AMOUNT OF BLOCK GRANTS. ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SIDE THERE ARE LOT MORE DISCRETIONARY PROPOSES A NEW PROPOSALS THAT MS COST DIMENSION. FUNDING FORMULA ONLINE PROGRAM CTE WE THINK ALL OF THESE PROPOSALS HAVE MERIT WORTH YOUR CONSIDERATION. THEY'RE NOT EASY THERE'S COMPLICATED ISSUES TO BE. DEALT WITH AND I THINK IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A RESPONSE TO THESE PROPOSALS AND ENACT THEM IN SOME FORM BY. BY THE BY THE BUDGET IN JUNE YOU NEED TO GET GOING EARLY ON THESE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT EASY ISSUES. AND WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN ALSO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY. I THINK MISS TAYLOR WE GO BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE A QUESTION POLL FOR THE PARTNER FINANCE AND THE OHIO I'LL START WITH THE MISTRUSTED. THE I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO AYE INCREASE FUNDING FOR THE PSA I THINK A LOT OF THE PEOPLE ON THE DICE ARE BUT IT CERTAINLY CATALYZE A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL. OF FUNDING IN THE BSA WOULD BE. AND. YOU RAISED THE POINT AT THE END OF YOUR PRESENTATION THAT. A ONE YEAR RECESSION IS LIKELY TO COST TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE WHICH THE BSA WOULD WOULD NOT COVER. BUT ALSO IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S RECESSION SCENARIO YOU PROJECTS THAT IN A MILD RECESSION THE TOTAL LOSS OF REVENUE WOULD BE ABOUT SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS SO OBVIOUSLY. THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS NINETY SA IS NOT EVEN A COME CLOSE TO COVER THAT ONE COVER TWENTY PERCENT SO. I IN THE OPINION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SHOULD THAT LIMIT BE RAISED THE CONSTITUTIONAL LIMIT OF TEN PERCENT OF OF STATE EXPENDITURES IN THE BSA AND IF SO WHAT'S AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL TO RAISE IT TO. THANK YOU I WOULD ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE ANALYST WHICH IS THAT A RESERVE AMOUNT I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS ANY MAGIC NUMBER FOR THE RIGHT RESERVE AMOUNT MAKING SOME OF THE HOUSE DO YOU. YOU OR HAVE RISK A VERSION OR HOW COMFORTABLE YOU ARE I THINK YOU RAISE A GOOD POINT AND WE OBVIOUSLY CAUTION NOT EVEN. AS GREAT AS IT IS TO REACH THE TARGET APPROVED BY VOTERS THE PROPOSITION TWO. IT BUYS YOU TIME IT WON'T ADDRESS PROBABLY THE FULL SCOPE OF A RECESSION ON AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST. I WILL SAY HISTORICALLY A PUTS US IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION IN THE STATE HAS BEEN DURING PREVIOUS RECESSIONS. ADDITIONALLY IN THE ELSE'S TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE PAST I WOULD JUST REMIND FOLKS THERE'S ACTUALLY TWO DIFFERENT RESERVE ACCOUNTS. A ONE IS THE STATE FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY WE DO PROPOSE KEEPING MONEY THERE IT'S MORE ON THE LAW ALLOWS IT HAS MUCH MORE LIQUIDITY. VERSES THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACT SO TO YOUR POINT. I THINK I WOULD LOOK AT BOTH ACCOUNTS AS BUILDING A TOTAL RESERVE AMOUNT WITH REALLY DIFFERENCE A LOVER'S AVAILABLE SHOULD SOMETHING HAPPEN WON WITH MUCH MORE LIQUIDITY ANOTHER WHICH WOULD PROBABLY INVOLVED MORE THOUGHTFUL LONGTERM PROCESS BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE IN THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACT. THANK YOU AYE MR TAYLOR A. I'D WANT TALK ABOUT STATE EXPENDITURES. THE. A OBVIOUSLY IT'S EASY FOR EVERYONE TO DO A VICTORY LAP OVER YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT REVENUES ARE UP SO MUCH BUT. I ALSO THINK THAT SOMETIMES THAT CALLS ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE DEGREE TO WHICH STATE EXPENDITURES HAVE BEEN GROWING AND IN MY OPINION THEY'VE BEEN GROWING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AT AN ALARMING RATE. IN FACT ALMOST THREE TIMES THE RATE OF INFLATION SO I THOUGHT IS THAT LEVEL OF EXPENDITURE GROWTH SUSTAINABLE LONG TERM IN YOUR OPINION. BUT I. IT WOULD DEPEND ON WHY THEY'RE GROWING AS THE DAY ARE THEY ONGOING OUR DAY YOU TALK ABOUT THE GENERAL FUND OR JUST GENERAL FUND AND SPECIAL FUN. I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT EXACTLY THE NUMBER THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO I HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE AT THE ACTUAL NUMBERS. WELL I THINK HOLISTICALLY I MEAN IT'S IT'S IT'S A COMBINATION OF A LOT OF THINGS. THE EFFECTS OF THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE THAT CHRISTIAN STATE SALARIES OF THE PENSION FUND INCREASES. INTO THE CREASE CONTRIBUTION FOR THOSE BALL THOSE PUT TOGETHER PAINT WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE IN A VERY ALARMING PICTURE. I MEAN I THINK THAT'S THE OTHER SIDE THAT YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT TO NOT ONLY WHAT HAPPENED STE WHAT IS YOUR LONG TERM REVENUE STREAM ONCE YOU TRY TO SMOOTH OUT THE EFFECTS. OF CAPITAL GAINS ANOTHER ONE TIME THINGS AND YOUR EXPENDITURES STRAINING AND CAN YOU BRING THOSE THOSE LINES NEED TO BE BROUGHT TOGETHER. AYE YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT MAYBE THEY'RE NOT OR THAT WE NEED TO BRING DOWN ONE AS OPPOSED TO YOU KNOW MAKING ADJUSTMENTS ON RESERVES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE OTHER. I KNOW I WOULD ENTIRELY AGREE WITH YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT BOTH SIDES. AND YOU WANT TO BRING THEM IN BALANCE. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. MISS MEDINA. I I HEARD AND SAW A LOT OF US. GOVERNORS PLAN FOR EDUCATION ESPECIALLY AS IT PERTAINS TO K. TWELVE. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE. BUT I DIDN'T HEAR OR SEE MUCH ON HIGHER EDUCATION. AND. IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS BOTH THE UC REGENTS AND THE CSU TRUSTEES WILL BE CONSIDERING TUITION HIKES. AND IT STRIKES ME THAT WE ARE GONNA BE ASKING CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. IN BOTH THE CSU AND THE UC TO PAY HIGHER TUITION. AT A TIME WHERE AS YOU JUST PRESENTED TO US CALIFORNIA IS DOING THE BEST. FINANCIALLY. AS YOU STATED. RETAILER IN YOUR LIFETIME. AND THAT'S A BIG IRONY TO ME. ARE IT IS MY UNDERSTOOD AND. I WILL ASK HOW DO YOU RESPOND AS THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION SPOT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS A A IN THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE REVENUES ARE THAT MANY OF THEM ARE ONE TIME THE NATURE SOME OF THE GAINS WERE SAYING ON THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX. WHICH IS EXTREMELY VOLATILE REVENUE SOURCE IN THE MAY REVISION IN OUR HIGHER EDUCATION CHAPTER WE SIGNAL TO BOTH THE ISSUE AND YOU SEE THAT THEY CAN ANTICIPATED THREE PERCENT INCREASE WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. THE GOVERNOR ALSO INDICATED BOTH IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE AS WELL AS IN OUR PUBLICATION THAT BEFORE WE PROCEED WITH TUITION INCREASES WE STILL ARE HOPING THAT BOTH THE ISSUE WHEN YOU SEE WILL REDUCE THEIR OVERALL COST STRUCTURES IN THIS TO NOT SADDLE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WITH INCREASED TUITION COSTS. AND WE CONTINUE TO. WHAT TO SEE THAT WITH BOTH SEGMENTS? TO FOLLOW UP. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE HAD BEEN AN AGREEMENT REACHED BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND YOU SEE FOR FOUR PERCENT ANNUAL INCREASE. BUT THIS YEAR WE'RE ONLY LOOKING AT A THREE PERCENT INCREASE TO THE UC BUT. THOSE WERE A PREVIOUS BUDGET YOURS IN THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR THEY HAVE FOUR PERCENT I BELIEVE IN THE BUDGET YEAR BEFORE THAT THEY HAD FOUR PERCENT BUT I BELIEVE IT'S ON PAGE TWENTY SEVEN OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION CHAPTER. OF NAY REVISION WE KNOW TO THREE PERCENT INCREASE FOR BOTH SEGMENTS SO WHEN YOU SEE TALKED ABOUT AND ENROLLMENT GROWTH. AND NOT KEEPING. AND NOT RAISING TUITION FOUR PERCENT WAS NEVER THE FIGURE THAT WAS. AGREED UPON. IN PREVIOUS BUDGET YEARS THAT WAS THE FIGURE THAT WAS AGREED TO AND NOT IN THE CAR AND NOT AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO BETTER. AND I JUST WANTED. CLARIFY ONE THING AROUND ENROLLMENT GROWTH SOON ROMAN GROWTH. WAS A SEPARATE AGREEMENT ESPECIALLY PARTICULAR IN RELATION TO YOU SEE. THAT ARMING WE STRUCTURED SO THAT WAS THE. DIFFERENT FROM THERE ARE PERCENT OF AUGMENTATION. AT THE AT THIS POINT DAY ARE ADHERING TO THE AGREEMENT BASED ON THE. ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT WE PROVIDED. IN THE BUDGET THE SHOW GOING IN CONNECTION. MR MESSAGES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MS ACOSTA. I. ONCE JOIN THE VICE CHAIR IN IT EXPRESSING MY APPRECIATION FOR THE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET PROPOSAL A PARTICULARLY AT THIS. A STRONG COMMITMENT TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY WHERE THE. THE STRONG COMMITMENT TO THE RAINY DAY FUND. AND ALSO. THE STRONG COMMITMENT TWO R. K. THROUGH TWELVE OF FINDING. OF WITH THE FULL FUNDING OF LCF F. TWO YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. WELL WHAT I AM GONNA CONCERNED ABOUT HOWEVER IS THAT. MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE URBAN AS WELL AS SUBURBAN AS WELL AS ROLE. IN THESE GOOD BUDGET TIMES. ARE PROJECTING DEFICITS. NO TWO YEARS OUT THREE YEARS OUT. WITH. THERE A PARTICULAR THEIR THEIR RISING PENSION COSTS AND THEIR RISING SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS. AND. SO I WANTED TO ASK WHAT WHAT IS THE GOVERNOR'S. OFFICES POSITION IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW. IF IF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE PROJECTING DEFICITS IN THESE CUT BUDGET TIMES. WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO? WHEN THE END OF UP ALREADY RECESSION DOES HIT. AS THE ALLIES POINTED OUT I THINK MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY HEARING AS WE ARE AS WELL FROM BOTH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND SCHOOL BOARDS ABOUT THEIR PENSION COST. I THINK MY RESPONSE WOULD BE TO THINK OF EDUCATION PREVIOUSLY VERSES NOW IN THE OLD CATEGORICAL WORLD IT WOULD BE EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ACCOUNT FOR SOME OF THESE COST THROUGH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AS WELL AS CONSOLIDATING MOST CATEGORICAL. SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE MUCH MORE FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS THESE ON GOING COST AND SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE SCHOOL DISTRICTS USING THIS NEW FLEXIBILITY AND THIS MASSIVE INFLUX OF CASH THE THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE. TO LOOK AT ALL OF THEIR DIFFERENCE. DEMANDS AND MAKE DECISIONS ACCORDINGLY WITH THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. OKAY AMEND THAT THAT SOUNDS GOOD BUT. I JUST HAD A CONVERSATION WITH ALL OF MY. LOCAL A SCHOOL BOARD PRESIDENT'S. THIS PAST WEEK AND. THEY'RE THEY'RE BASICALLY WENT WHEN I. ONE AND YOU KNOW. THINKING THAT I WOULD BE DELIVERING GOOD NEWS IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW THE SEVEN STRAIGHT. A YEAR OF INCREASED QUE THROUGH TALL FINDING A ALONG WITH YOU KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT THEY WOULD APPRECIATE MORE LOCAL CONTROL. THERE AND THEY ARE THEY THEY WERE EXPRESSING THEIR FRUSTRATION THAT. THAT THEY BASICALLY THAT THE STATE IS THEY THE WAY THEY SEE IT THE STATE IS TAKING AWAY MORE THAN THE STATE IS GIVING. PRIMARILY IN TERMS OF THE RAMPING UP OF THE TELSTRA ERRORS. PENSION SCHEDULE AND AND SO. YOU KNOW I I WAS KIND OF TAKEN ABACK BECAUSE IT WENT THROUGH SUCH A DISCONNECT BETWEEN. WHAT FOLKS THERE THAT THE PREVAILING NARRATIVE HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND WHAT? MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE FEELING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO IS SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THAT THERE. THE. THE IN THE IN THE PENSION COSTS. WHAT IS THE GOVERNOR IS SO A POSITION IN TERMS OF? ANY CONSIDERATION ABOUT. USING EITHER SOME OF THE. FUNDS THAT ARE BEING DEVOTED TOWARD THE. RAINY DAY FUND OR PERHAPS ADDITIONAL REVENUES THAT MAY COME IN THE MAY REVISE. TOWARD. RELIEF FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN TERMS OF MEETING THEIR PENSION. WE HAVEN'T CONTEMPLATED A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL I KNOW SOME ADVOCATES HAVE ASKED FOR PROPOSALS TO INCREASE FUNDING. TO THINK AS WE MOVE TOWARDS MAY REVISE OBVIOUSLY WILL JUST THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED BASED ON OVERALL REVENUES. AND OF WE WAS LOOK I THINK DOWN IN THIS WORLD OF INCREASED FLEXIBILITY. AND LOOK AT IT WITH IN THE OVERALL CONTEXT OF THE BUDGET. MAY THINK BETWEEN THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACT IN NINETY EIGHT FUNDING IT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TO THE DEGREE PUT MORE MONEY IN THE GUARANTEED DOES INCREASE YOUR OUT YOUR COST BECAUSE YOU'VE INCREASE THE GUARANTEES WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS OUR CALCULATION OF THE GUARANTEE BASED ON REVENUES. AT A LIKELY MOVE DURING MAY REVISE AS WE HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON REVENUES ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF DECEMBER RECEIPTS. OF BEING PRETTY HIGH. GREAT THANK YOU MISTER FUNG. I THINK THIS CHAIR. I GOT ONE OF FOCUS ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE AND A FORCE MANAGEMENT. CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND. WITH THE PASSIVE SP ONE THERE'S BEEN A FOCUS ON MAINTENANCE. WHAT'S THE DISCUSSION OR THE ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH OF. THE BUDGET NOW AND MOVING FORWARD IS GOING TO BE. ALLOCATED TOWARD NEW HIGHWAY CAPACITY OR GENERAL PURPOSE LANES HOW TO RELIEVE TRAFFIC CONGESTION. I THINK YOU ARE OUR PRIORITY ON THE AS THE ONE FUNDS HAS BEEN FIX IT FIRST PROJECTS SO REALLY THOSE THAT ARE READY TO GO. THAT OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS VERSES EXPANSION. I CAN TELL YOU I HAVE SOME NUMBERS HERE. BASED ON ARE I HAVE PROJECTED INCREASE IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET. THAT THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS WOULD REPAIR OVER THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND POTHOLES. THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THREE LANE MILES OF CRACKED PAVEMENT FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SQUALLS ALSO NOTICED CHIPPED PAVEMENTS. AND REPAIR ONE POINT FOUR MILLION. SQUARE FEET IF BRIDGES. WE'VE ACCELERATE TWO HUNDRED EIGHT HIGHWAY AND BRIDGE PROJECTS WORTH OVER A BILLION DOLLARS TO DELIVER ONE YEAR EARLY BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. SO REALLY OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN ON EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND FIXING THOSE ROADS AYE AND ACCELERATING PROJECTS THAT WE CAN A TO GET THE MONEY OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WILL THEY WILL THERE BE A FOCUS IN THE FUTURE OR. WILL DEBATE WILL YOU WILL DIMINISH ENTERTAIN A DISCUSSION IN TERMS OF HOW TO ALLOCATE SOME OF THE FUNDS TO NEW GENERAL OF A GENERAL PURPOSE LANES ARE NEW HIGHWAY CAPACITY. THANK YOU SEE BOTH DEPARTMENT FINANCE. ARE EARLY IN THE PROCESS WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE MAIN ITS EFFORTS TO TRY TO GET OURSELVES BACK. YOU KNOW GO OUR SOULS CAUGHT UP ON A LOT OF A MAINTENANCE THAT IS THAT'S FALLING BEHIND. ALSO. MANY OF THE BILL THE LARGER. VOTE LOOK SHOT PROJECTS A REHABILITATION PROJECTS THOSE TAKE LONGER TIME TO TO GET PLAN TO GET DONE THAT NORMALLY SO IF FOUR FIVE SECURE PROJECTS. IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE'S FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR. CONGESTED CORRIDOR PROGRAMS THIS FUNDING AVAILABLE OTHER SNOW TUNER MILLION DOLLARS YEAR FOR CONGESTED CORRIDORS. THERE'S TWENTY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR COMMUTER CORRIDORS. YET THIS MONEY ALONG WITH THE THE MONEY THAT'S GONNA BE AVAILABLE FOR ON THE REHABILITATION PROJECTS. AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND AND THEN SHIFT MORE TOWARDS THE THE PROJECTS PROJECTS ARE MORE READY. THAT MONEY THEN WE'LL LOOK AT PROJECTS THAT HAVE. THAT THE CALL BENEFITS OF SOME CAPACITY INCREASE THAT COME ALONG WITH THE REHABILITATION JUST SO I UNDERSTAND AND MAYBE CAN CLARIFY THIS FOR ME MYERS AND THAT IS THAT THE CONGESTED CORRIDORS FINDING THERE'S A PROHIBITION TO USE ANY OF THOSE FUNDS FOR GENERAL PURPOSE LANES. IS THAT CORRECT. I DON'T LIKE THE THE. THE GUIDELINES FOR USE OF THOSE OF THOSE FUNDS ARE ARE STILL BEING DEVELOPED. BUT THERE ISN'T ALWAYS I MEAN YOU CAN YOU CAN ACHIEVE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY NOT NECESSARILY BY ALWAYS ADDING TO SHOW MIGHT SOMETIMES IT'S IT'S COORDINATING THE LANE SOMETIMES IT'S. YOU KNOW COORDINATING THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC SO THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT GOES INTO JUNE BIT TO AND BEEN. JUST ADDING ADDITIONAL POINTS NOW ALL THE PROJECTS ARE PROVED TO SEE TC'S PROCESS SO THERE WILL BE. GUIDELINES FOR WITH. IT WHAT MAKES THE PROJECTS WHAT WHAT PROJECTS ARE THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS AND THEY'LL HAVE RESULTS THAT THEY'LL HAVE TO MEASURE TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BURKE CHEATING THOSE RESULTS SO. YOU KNOW REDUCING CONGESTION IS IS THE MAIN YOU KNOW THE MAIN RESULT THAT'S. BEING LOOKED FOR OUT OF THOSE PARTICULAR FUNDS OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ANSWERS OF. LOVE MOVING TO WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION. TO. ALLOCATE SOME FUNDING TO. MORE SURFACE WATER STORAGE. I HAVE MY STAFF THAT APPEAR PROVIDES MORE SPECIFICS BUT AS I TESTIFIED EARLIER WE DO HAVE A POSTAL TWO. CAN A FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM PRE APPROPRIATE SOME OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES BONDS DOLLARS ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS. ON SOME OF THAT OBVIOUSLY IS FOR OUR WATER AND THAT'LL UNISOM. A COUPLE YEARS AGO. THE VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION ONE SHE'S ME MATT ARMY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. COUPLE YEARS AGO THE VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION ONE WHICH WAS A WATER BOND IN WITH IN THAT PROPOSITION ONE OF BOND INCLUDED I BELIEVE WAS ABOUT THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF. FUNDING FOR. ADDITIONAL SURFACE STORAGE THAT WAS CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED IN THE CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSION. I BELIEVE JUST RECENTLY ADOPTED ITS GUIDELINES. TO GOVERN THE USE OF THAT AND SO. MY UNDERSTANDING OF THAT THE CURRENT PROCESSES THAT YOU GET YOURS GOING THROUGH THE. PROCESS OF EVALUATING APPLICATIONS FOR THAT OKAY WELL JUST ECHO TO AN ANALYST IS SAYING I THINK WE DO. WANT TO FOCUS MORE LONG TERM AND. THE CONCERN I THINK FOR THE A LOT OF THOSE FUNDS IS THAT. THEY'RE GOING FOR HIM. A LOT OF PROJECTS BUT NOT ONES THAT OF SUBSTANTIAL SIZE TO WHERE WE CAN WITH IT WHETHER. THROUGH THE LARGE DROUGHT AS WE'VE EXPERIENCE HISTORICALLY SO IN TERMS OF LIKE PROJECTS LIKE SITES ARE TEMPERANCE. WHERE IT WILL HAVE SOME SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS OF THE SAKE OF WHERE THEY ARE SIZABLE INVESTMENTS AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF THE ADMINISTRATION IS DISCUSSING? IN INVESTING SOME OF THE. BUT MAKING AN INVESTMENT FROM THE BUDGET IN TERMS OF DOING LARGE SCALE WATER STORAGE. A LIKE I SAID I THINK THE. GIVEN THE SIZEABLE INVESTMENT OF PROPOSITION ONE. THAT DOES REFLECT A IN THAT WAS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S OF WATER ACTION PLAN. I SHOULD SAY TOO SO THE ADMINISTRATION THROUGH ITS WATER ACTION PLAN IN SUPPORT OF PROPOSITION ONE HAS. DEMONSTRATED A COMMITMENT FOR ADDITIONAL STORAGE CAPACITY COMBINED WITH WATER CONSERVATION COMBINED WITH BETTER GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT KIND OF. ALL OF THE ABOVE TYPE. APPROACH TO WATER AND IF I MAY THEM OFF OF THE ANALYST COMMENT ONE OF THE. SHE'S CAUTIONED I THINK IT'S A BENEFIT ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF REACHING THE CONSTITUTIONAL TARGET OF PROPOSITION TWO IS THAT IN FUTURE YEARS ANY DOLLARS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED INTO THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACT OR UTILIZED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. SO THEORETICALLY IF THE ENACTED BUDGET REACHES THAT TEN PERCENT CONSTITUTIONAL. A HOT TARGET YOU WOULD HAVE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR A VARIETY OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. THANK YOU AND LASTLY JUST IN FUN FORCE MANAGEMENT. OUT OF SOMEONE ELSE IS GONNA RUN APPEAR AND ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS SO I APOLOGIZE LIKE. I KNOW THAT THE BUDGET HAS FOCUSED A LOT ON FIRE PROTECTION BUT IN TERMS OF PREVENTION. AND AND HEALTHY FORESTS. HOW MUCH IS ALLOCATED TOWARD? THE FORCE MANAGEMENT AND HOW MUCH IS. NEEDED TO ACTUALLY PREVENT A LOT OF THESE HOW CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES ARE VERY. WE ACTUALLY MADE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN FORCE MANAGEMENT THROUGH THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN IN THE CURRENT YEAR OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. WE STOP THE STATE RESPONSE THAT RESPONSIBILITY AREA FEE AND HAVE FACT FILLED ALL OF THOSE ACTIVITIES WHICH INCLUDE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION AND THERE'S TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WITH A VERY HEALTHY EXPENDITURE PERIOD FOR FOREST MANAGEMENT. ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO TRADITIONALLY HOME OR PREVIOUSLY WE HAD HAD TREE MORTALITY DOLLAR SPECIFICALLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN THE CURRENT YEAR IT'S ACTUALLY THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN. WITH JUST LAST QUESTION I I THINK HE WAS CHAIR. IN TERMS OF LIKE TREE MORTALITY AND. I THINK A LOT OF THESE PROBLEMS ARE ARE WORSENING AND I THINK THAT THE FIRES ARE GOING LARGER. IN SO WE OUT SEE CLEARLY NEED TO DO A LOT MORE IN FORCE MANAGEMENT AND AND AND. IT IS THAT IS TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS ENOUGH I GUESS IS THE QUESTION IS THERE AN ANALYSIS FROM CAL FIRE. FROM ANY OTHER ANALYSTS ARE DEPARTMENT THAT THAT. GIVES US A SENSE OF IS THERE A GAP THAT WE NEED TO. TO MEET TO ADDRESS THAT THIS THIS GROWING PROBLEM. I WOULD POINT TO SOME OTHER ALLOCATION PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE OUTSIDE OF THE CAP AND TRADE A THINK WE TRY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR WHAT WE CALL THE NEW NORMAL WITH CALIFORNIA ARE. THEY REALLY ARE MOVING TO REALLY A TWELVE MONTH FIRE SEASON SO WE TRY TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR SOCKS STOPPING THROUGH OUR BUDGET PROPOSAL. DISSING WE HAVE SOME PROPOSALS TO BRING HELICOPTERS AND UPDATE SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED HAD TO FIGHT FOREST FIRES AS WELL AS PREVENT THEM. SO I THINK WE'VE MADE SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN THIS AREA AND WE'RE CONTINUING THOSE IN OUR PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU. BUT THEY'VE BEEN MUCH. THANK YOU ARE MISSING OUT. THINK YOU AT A COUPLE COMMENTS AND THEN SOME QUESTIONS AND ON THE EDUCATION SIDE AND I WANT TO ECHO THE VOICES OF THE. THOSE THAT HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND THEIR FEELINGS AND PERSPECTIVE ON THE BUDGET IS NOT A LYING TO AND THIS YOU KNOW THE CAPITAL STATE THE GOVERNOR'S PERSPECTIVE I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HEAR LOUD AND CLEAR SO. I HOPE THAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS WILL BE I WILL CONTINUE. BECAUSE AIDS TO VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS ON IT OUTLOOKS ON AND THE BUDGET. AND ADDITIONALLY I I WANT TO. I COMMEND THE CONSIDERATION FOR KIND OF THE REDESIGN OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE FUNDING I KNOW THAT THE LA ALSO DID A REPORT RECENTLY THAT LOOKED. ON A LITTLE BIT MORE AT WHAT CATEGORY CLOSE LOOK LIKE WHO THE SERVE WITH THE DON'T SERVE. AND AND SO I THINK THAT THE AND SEEMS A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT CAME OUT OF THAT REPORT IN THERE. AND I THINK IS. INTERESTING AND I DO HOPE THAT IN. BUDGETS UP TO WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT. ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR PIECE AND I ALSO HOPE THAT IN BUDGETS OF TO AND IN HIGHER ED. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE I'M TO UNDERSTAND. REALLY IF THAT'S THE VEHICLE TO ACHIEVE NOT ONLY DEGREES BUT DEGREES FOR THOSE THAT ARE MOST UNDERSERVED. AT PARTICULARLY IN DESERT AREAS OF HIGHER AD SO I DO HOPE THAT THOSE TWO COMMITTEES I WILL CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION. MY QUESTION IS ABOUT THE STATE FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. YEAH WE JUST I HEARD AT. THAT. YOU DESCRIBE IT HELLFIRE IS NO LONGER PAPA GOING TO BE LOOKED AT HAS A SEASONAL BUT YEAR ROUND. OUR GOVERNOR ON DECEMBER NINETEENTH WAS IN THE THOMAS FIRE AREA. WHICH I REPRESENT. AND TALKED ABOUT THIS BEING THE NEW NORMAL SO MY QUESTION IS IF THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL DO WE USE THE STATE FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY WHICH IS ONE OF THE CHIU. BUDGET AREAS YOU DESCRIBED AS RESERVES. TO BE USED FOR EMERGENCY AS THE VEHICLE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THIS IF THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL DO WE NEED TO BREAK CONSIDER. THE IMPACT THAT THE NEW NORMAL HAS I'M ON THE BUDGET AND TO REALLY LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF A RESERVE OR IS THIS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETHINK. HOW THE STATE IS GOING TO RESPOND TO NATURAL DISASTERS AT A MUCH BROADER LEVEL? THANK YOU I THINK WE'VE ATTEMPTED TO DO BOTH. I THINK WE TRY TO ADJUST THE STOCKING LEVELS AT CAL FIRE. OH YES AND SOME OF OUR OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS. IT'S HARD FOR US TO PROTECT OBVIOUSLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN I CAN TELL YOU IN THE BUDGETS THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED AND WE'VE TRIED DROUGHT WE'VE HAD FLOODING HOW FIRES MUDSLIDES SO IT CERTAINLY. SEEMS TO BE MORE THE CASE THE NOTS. AND ADDITIONALLY HAD SOMETHING THE COMPOUNDS ARE EMERGENCY RESPONSES THAT LIKELY MUCH OF THIS WILL BE REIMBURSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THAT IS A LONGER. TERM PROCESS THAT WE GO THROUGH WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO IN SOME WAYS THE AS AT THE U. IS IS KIND OF PERFECTLY PLACED ACTUALLY TO HELP US WITH THE SHORT INFUSIONS OF CASH TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE A MERCHANT THE RESPONSE. IS QUICK IS TIMELY WELL AS WELL AS RECOVERY FRANKLY THROUGH THE JAIL BC PROCESS WE'VE NOTIFIED THE LEGISLATURE OF THINGS SUCH AS HAZARDOUS WASTE REMOVAL THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN RIGHT AWAY BEFORE THESE COMMUNITIES CAN REALLY BEGIN TO REBUILD. SO I THINK IT'S A TWO FOLD APPROACH LOOKING AT OUR OVERALL STAFFING LEVELS. BASED ON HISTORIC TRENDS WHICH SEEMS TO BE CHANGING AS WE CALL THE NEW NORMAL. AS WELL AS AND UTILIZING OUR. SFE YOU FOR THE THINGS THAT INVARIABLY WILL HAPPEN. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS YOU KNOW THERE WAS A HORRIBLE HEPATITIS OUTBREAK IN SAN DIEGO WE ALSO SEND SOME FUNDING THERE TO HELP WITH THAT. SO THERE IS. THE BUDGET IS A FLUID PROCESS HOME OBVIOUSLY WE PASSED IT IN JUNE BUT THINGS HAPPEN EMERGENCIES PUBLIC HEALTH. ON NATURAL DISASTERS HAPPEN IN THE US AT THE U. HELPS US ADDRESS THOSE IN A REAL TIME MANNER. A I WOULD JUST ADD TO. TO MISS COST IS A DISCUSSION THAT ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE DO TO ADDRESS KIND OF THIS NEW NORMAL FROM A BUDGETARY STANDPOINT. IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S. BUDGET HAS AN ITEM IN AND CALLED THE EMERGENCY FUND THE FUND IT'S KIND OF A SHORTHAND. AND IT REFLECTS WHAT THE A FIVE YEAR AVERAGE OF EMERGENCY. WHILE FIRE SUPPRESSION COSTS HAVE BEEN IN AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AFTER A SEVERE DROUGHT OF HISTORIC PROPORTIONS. THE AMOUNT THAT. THE ADMINISTRATION IS BUDGETING IN THE FUND HAS GROWN A PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS SO THE BUDGET NOT ONLY HAS THE. SIZEABLE RESERVE TO ADDRESS THESE UNCERTAINTIES BUT IS ALSO A BUDGETING WITHIN THIS EMERGENCY FUND ITEM. A HIGHER AMOUNT TO REFLECT THIS. THIS NORM. AND SO FOR THAT ESSAY FOR YOU FUNDS IT DO YOU FEEL THAT I MEAN JUST IN THE SAME WAY WE ARE RECONSIDERING. AND THE BSA COMMITMENT AND WHETHER THAT SHOULD BE MORE THANTHE ALLOTTED. IS THERE VALUE TO RECONSIDER THAT AS WELL FOR THE AND SAFE SFE YOU FUNDS. THIS WILL BE ANOTHER ITEM THAT WILL LOOK AT ME REVISE AYE IT'S LARGELY DRIVEN BY OVERALL REVENUES WHAT WE KNOW OUR EXISTING ON GOING COSTS ARE INCLUDING IN THE GUARANTEE WHAT PROPOSITION TWO REQUIRES AND SO AS WE REEVALUATE REVENUES GOING INTO MAY REVISE WILL LOOK ASSET TO YOU AS. WELL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CABALLERO. I THINK MISTER CHAIR I AM EVERYONE AT SECOND WHAT'S BEEN SAID BY MY COLLEAGUES IN REGARDS TO THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT TO IT. PRUDENT BUDGETING PROCESS I UNDERSTOOD THE PRINCIPLE YOU WERE DISCUSSING I JUST COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THE NUMBERS SO IT IT MAY BE HELPFUL IF YOU COULD DO A ONE PAGER IF THAT'S AT ALL POSSIBLE WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT. EITHER CONSTITUTIONAL OR STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHEN WE PUSH A BUTTON IN ONE SPOT OR PHIL. APART IN ONCE BUT WHAT IT DOES TO THE OVERALL EXPECTATION THE COMING YEAR BECAUSE I I THINK THAT. THE POINT YOU MADE IS. IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD REPEAT IT IN IF I COULDN'T CAN'T REPEAT IT THEN I DON'T KNOW HOW TO AVOID IT SO IF YOU COULD GET THAT TO A SAID BEATRIZ ACTITUD. I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. THE. THE FIRE ISSUE IN PARTICULAR AS IT RELATES TO HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION DEAD OR DYING TREES. THERE IS NO QUESTION IN MY MIND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT POLICY CHANGES TO ALLOW US TO GET THOSE TREES. THAT ARE FALLING DOWN AND CREATING A GREENHOUSE GAS. EXPLOSION AND. WITH THE DETERIORATION OF THE PARK UP AND PUT THEM TO GOOD USE AND I THINK THERE'S THAT REALLY WILL HELP RURAL CALIFORNIA. EMAM TURN TALKING ABOUT THAT BIOMASS BUT THERE'S SOME SOME CHANGES THAT NEED TO HAPPEN. IN THAT REGARD AND. I THINK WE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ADDRESS IT BECAUSE. THE LOSS OF PROPERTY AND LIFE. BECAUSE OF THIS NEW NORMAL IS UNACCEPTABLE MCCARTY DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN. PROTECT AS MUCH AS WE CAN THE THE FUEL SOURCE THAT REALLY HAS THESE GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE. SO I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION REGARD THAT I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE IT IS AN ISSUE THAT. I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING VERY CAREFULLY AND CLOSELY AND. AND IF IT'S IT'S MORE OF A ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER NOT TAKING CARE OF THESE. DEAD AND DYING TREES BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE LOSS OF LIFE AND AND PROPERTIES IS DEVASTATING SO WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WANNA MOVE REAL QUICKLY SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THE. WOMAN WHO RAN UP ON. I'M ON THE COURT SYSTEM AND I AND I I I I WANT TO TALK I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS THAT THAT'S ONE OF THEM. BUT WITH THE BUDGET USES THEIR WORKLOAD BASED ALLOCATION AND FINING METHODOLOGY UP HAD EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH. MY LOCAL COURTS AND THAT. METHODOLOGY HURTS. SMALL WORLD. COUNTY COURT COURT SYSTEMS AND. CURRENTLY SAM BENITO COUNTY IS LAYING OFF A LONG TIME STAFF. OR A CREATING PART TIME JOBS FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY CAN NO LONGER. AFFORD TO KEEP THEM ON STAFF AND SO IT'S THAT FUNDING FORMULA THAT WEIGHS. DEVELOPED AS I UNDERSTAND IT DURING THE DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY AS A SOLUTION TO KIND EQUALIZE THE FUNDING. AND I THINK IT IT DOWN I'D LIKE TO TO LOOK AT THAT FUNDING FORMULA TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT REALLY. IS THE CORRECT FORMULA. ALL. IMAGE ARTIST'S DEPARTMENT FINANCE I THINK THAT ON YES I AGREE WORK FIRST ARE THE WORKLOAD ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY. WAS DEVELOPED A TIME WHEN THE COURTS WERE AND STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY. AND I THINK WHAT THIS IS ATTEMPTING TO DO IS TO READJUST. THE AND ALLOCATIONS BASED ON THE NEW AVERAGE CASE WAIT BY COURT. SO SAN BENITO WAS ACTUALLY A LOT OF THE CASE WAIT. I AM RIGHT NOW IN THEIR AND SERENE TERMS THEY'RE FUNNY METHODOLOGY THERE ARE ABOUT EIGHTY ONE POINT SEVEN WHERE THE AVERAGE CASE WEIGHT IS SEVENTY SIX POINT NINE. SO THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT. AND CERTAINLY THINK A LOT OF COURTS ARE STILL EXPERIENCING THOSE I'M STAFFING ISSUES WE DON'T AND WE AGREE THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BUDGET A METHODOLOGY. BUT FOR PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING A BASELINE IT MADE SENSE FOR US TO USE SOME KIND OF STANDARD METRIC IN THIS CASE IT WAS. THE MOST RECENT UPDATED I HAVE KEY SWEETS. SO I AM JUST WANNA EMPHASIZE THAT OF THEIR CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS THAT WE HAVE OF OUR COURT SYSTEM. AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE A BIG COUNTY OR SMALL COUNTY WE STILL HAVE EXPECTATIONS. WHEN THOSE WHEN YOU CAN'T MEET THE MANY LONGER AND YOU'RE STARTING TO LAY OFF STAFF. BEDDED BEEN AROUND FOR A REALLY LONG TIME OR CUT DID THE HOURS THAT THE CLERK'S OFFICE IS OPEN THEN IT'S IT IT REALLY HAS AN IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY SO I THOUGHT SEEMS TO ME. UP AND WE TALK ABOUT THIS MORE THAT THERE SHOULD BE AT LEAST A BASE FORMULA. THAT PROVIDES. ADEQUATE STAFFING FOR THE COURTS TO BE ABLE TO. SERVE THE FUNCTIONS SOME BASIC FUNCTIONS AND THEN WE LOOK AT THE CASE LOAD IN THE KIND OF. UP THE SERIOUSNESS OF CASES AND. WHAT THEY'RE OF RESOURCES ARE IN THAT PARTICULAR A COMMUNITY AS WELL SO? I THINK THAT THAT PARTICULAR FORMULA HAS SOME PROBLEMS FOR ME AND I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT AND THEN ALSO. THE. FOR THE FUNDING OF THE COURTS A NUMBER OF COURT HOUSES THAT WERE. IN THE PLANNING STAGES WERE. WERE DELAYED UP AND THEY BEEN DELAYED TO THE DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY IT IS THERE A SCHEDULE. FOR. THE NUMBER OF COURTHOUSES CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IT WOULD MOVE FORWARD AND DO WE KNOW. ABOUT WHERE THAT WOULD BE. THAT I MET HER THAT I KNOW OVER TO ANDREAS HER FOR HER CAPITAL OUTLAY UNIT BUT HE DID ALSO WANT TO MENTION JUST IN RESPONSE TO YOUR OTHER QUESTION ABOUT THE EQUALIZATION OF COURTS. IS IN ADDITION TO THE BRING EVERYBODY UP TO THAT STANDARD KEY SWEET BASELINE WE HAVE THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S IN DISCRETIONARY FUNDS THAT WILL ALLOW THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO SET PRIORITIES ON A STATEWIDE BASIS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THEY WILL PROBABLY DISTRIBUTE AND MORE EQUITABLY ACROSS THE STATE AND BASED ON THEIR NEEDS AND I THINK THAT'S ONE. ISSUE WILL BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I WOULD NOT ON THE PORT CONSTRUCTION OBVIOUSLY THIS IS THE MAJOR PROPOSE ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO UTILIZE WHAT'S LEFT IN IT. AND TO AUTHORIZE LEASE REVENUE BONDS. THE TEN PROJECTS THAT WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD AS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL AND AND MY COLLEAGUE CAN TALK TO AT WAR WITH THOSE THAT WERE FURTHER ALONG IN THEIR PLANNING PROCESS THOSE THAT WERE REALLY READY TO GO. STANDARDS ARE FOR A DEPARTMENT FINANCE THAT'S CORRECT WE HAVE. TEN PROJECT PROPOSED AS AND. AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN PROJECTS THAT ARE POP. ON THE OVERALL LIST OF IT MEDIAN CRITICAL NEEDS PROJECTS FOR THE COURTS AND. DOES IT WOULD NOT BE READY FOR CONSTRUCTION FOR ANOTHER FIVE MINIMUM OF TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OF THOSE MAY BE CONSIDERED IN FUTURE BUDGETS. SO IT DO YOU HAVE A LIST OF THOSE PARTICULAR PROJECTS CAN YOU CAN YOU TELL ME IF THE SOUTH MONTEREY COUNTY IS IS PART OF THE TENER PART OF THE LATER. NUMBERS IN THE REASON I SAY THAT IS THAT. OUR OUR COUNTY IS. IT. THAT PARTICULAR COURT HOUSES KIND OF BEEN IN THE PLANS FOR A LONG TIME IT. THE COURT CLOSED THE SOUTH COUNTY COURTHOUSE A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO SO EVERYBODY HAS TO TRAVEL IN ITS. BOB. FAIRLY ISOLATED. UP TO SALINAS HER OVER TO MONTEREY COUNTY TO GET JUSTICE AND SO THAT COURTHOUSE IS PRETTY IMPORTANT TO TO UP TO MY DISTRICT. THANK YOU AND NO IT IS NOT PART OF THE LIST THAT WOULD BE READY FOR CONSTRUCTION OKAY WITHIN. THE TIME THAT TIME THE TEN THAT YOU WAS IT I THOUGHT IT IS NOT. ON THE LIST OF THE ADDITIONAL SEVEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER. BUSINESS COURSES WITH COSTA NOW THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DISCUSSES INSTANTLY. THE CALIFORNIA CONFLICTS TAX CREDIT. PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM. THE ADMINISTRATION TALK ABOUT BUT THE MINUTE PROGRAM LOOK LIKE. SPECIFICALLY THE SMALL BUSINESS PORTION. THAT'S THE ONE PORTION WE OWE ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON I WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH THAT THE ALLIES HAD SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR PORTION OF HE. I CHECKED THAT WOULD LIKE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION SO WE DO HOPE IN THE COMING WEEKS TO PROVIDE YOU MORE DETAIL ABOUT THAT PORTION OF THE PROPOSAL. DID YOU. THANK YOU MISTER PARIS. THANK YOU THANK WAS CHAIRMAN. I WANT TO. FOLLOW UP A LITTLE BIT ON MEMBER FUNCTION QUESTION WITH RESPECT CAPACITY. I WANT FOCUS PRINTS UPS SPECIFICALLY ON A HIGHWAY NINETY NINE. NOT IT IS. ARGUABLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THAT COMMERCIAL. ROUTE IT IS SO SIGNIFICANT THAT WITH RESPECT TO TRAFFIC. AS WELL. IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS BUDGET. OR ANYTHING IN THE S. B. ONE. TAX INCREASE. THAT WOULD PRIORITIZE FOR ACCELERATE. BRINGING THE TWO LANE NORTH SOUTH. PINCH POINTS ON NINETY NINE UP TO. THREE LANE NORTH SOUTH THE REASON I POINT THAT OUT IS RATHER OBVIOUS. WHEN NORTH SOUTH TRAFFIC IS IN THREE LANDS. ARE THERE AT THE LIMIT. IT'S SAFER. IT THIS OBVIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT FLOW OF OF TRAFFIC WHEN IT GOES DOWN TO THE. THAT PINCH POINTS. A TWO LANE PINCH POINTS THE BRIGHT LIGHTS COME ON THE TRAFFIC SLOWS DOWN. THE. FENDER BENDERS GO UP. AND THE FRUSTRATION OF DRIVERS. GO UP AS WELL. ANYTHING AT ALL THAT. COULD. ENCOURAGE THOSE OF US WHO REPRESENT. THE NINETY NINE. THAT SOME OF THE TAX INCREASES IN SP ONE. AND SOME OF THE PRIORITIES OF THE OF THE GOVERNOR WOULD INCLUDE DATA PRIORITIZING AND ACCELERATING. BUT THE LATE ADDITIONS TO NINETY NINE. I MEAN AS FAR AS THE OF THEM STEVE AUSTIN DEPARTMENT FINANCES FAR AS THE. THE THE ACTUAL FUNDING OF THE INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS THAT ARE TO BE CHOSEN. IN ALL THE PROJECTS A THREE PROBE THE PROGRAM THROUGH THE CTS. SO THE THE CHOICE OF WHICH PROJECTS TO TO MOVE FORWARD WITH FIRST OR TO TO PROGRAM. IT IS MADE BY THEM HOWEVER THERE IS A EITHER THERE'S FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS COMBINED AVAILABLE EVERY YEAR. SPECIFICALLY FOR. COMMUTER CORRIDORS AND TRADE QUARTER ENHANCEMENT. SO THOUGH THOSE FUNDING BUT THOSE THINGS NEW. YET LET'S STRAIGHTEN IT. ENTIRELY FROM THE NEW S. B. ONE FUNDS. THERE'S ALSO A THE. THE ADDITIONAL SB ONE FUNDS AS ALLOWED THE THE SHOP PROGRAM TO GO FROM. AN ANNUAL CAPACITY OF APPROXIMATELY TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS TO. OVER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO FOUR POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS HERE SO. THERE'S THAT PASSED THE BUILTIN THERE YOU KNOW BEGINNING AND IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND MOVING FORWARD. SO THE PROJECTS THAT WERE ALREADY IN THE SHOP. AMOUNTED TO ABOUT TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS SO. THERE'S THAT ADDITIONAL CAPACITY OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND THEN YOU KNOW FOUR BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR MOVING ON AT LEAST IN THE THE THE CHOP BEING A FOR YOUR. FOR YOUR LISTA PROJECTS SO. THERE'S A LOT OF CAPACITY FOR A LOT OF PROJECTS. AND. AND THEN. DID THE ATTEMPT NORMALLY ON THESE PROJECTS IS TO TRY TO UTILIZE AS MANY AS FUNDS SOURCES AND IT AND GET SYNERGY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IF YOU CAN. YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN MAKE A PROJECT IF OU CAN IF YOU CAN TOUCH THE ROAD ONCE AND TAKE CARE OF MANY PROBLEMS YOU CAN. ON THEIR SCENTED THERE'S ALWAYS ATTEMPTED DO THAT SO. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE PRIORITIZATION OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS THAT'S PROBABLY YOU KNOW SOMETHING WE COULD. THE DISCUSS AND. THINKING SUBCOMMITTEE WHEN WE HAVE. CALTRANS OR SEEK TO SEE AVAILABLE. BUT I DO KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR. THAT TYPE. THEM WE BUT. QUERY DOUBT. CALTRANS WITH RESPECT TO EXISTING OF PIPELINE. EXPANSION ARM ON THE NINETY NINE AND I. WERE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF GATHERING INFORMATION BUT I FIND WHAT WE'VE READ. RECEIVED. SO FAR. REALLY IS LIMITED. MINIMAL AND SPOTTY. AND IF YOU. WERE TO. LOOK AT. THE SIGNIFICANT PINCH POINTS NORTH AND SOUTH. THEY ARE THEY ARE THAT DO JUST IT'S AS IF THE NO THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CORRIDOR IN THE STATE. AFTER NORTH SOUTH THEIR TRANSPORTATION. SORT OF IS GETTING I THINK THE. THE BACKSEAT TO ALL OF THIS. SO WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT SEEING A LOT OF THAT. SO FAR NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO I'M I'M CONCERNED. THAT IT SEEMS TO ME THERE SOME AMBIGUOUS NESS HERE WITH RESPECT TO HOW MUCH MONEY IS LIMITED FOR CAPACITY IMPROVEMENT AND CONGESTION. MITIGATION. AND SO I I REALLY THINK THAT. OF WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT INFRASTRUCTURE EXPENDITURE AND WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT BANG FOR THE BUCK AND WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT SAFETY AND ALL THAT. FOR THIS NINETY NINE CORRIDOR NEEDS TO BE THREE LANES NORTH SOUTH FROM A BAKERSFIELD TO SACRAMENTO FOR A WHOLE RAFT OF OF REASONS. ALONG THOSE CORRIDORS ARE SIGNIFICANT SELF HELP COUNTIES. A FRESNO BEING ONE OF THE MOTHERS. AND SO HAVE I APPRECIATE. THE INVITATION. TO EXPLORE THESE IN MORE DETAIL IN THE BUDGET SUB THREE AND. BUT WE WILL BE DOING THAT. IN AN EFFORT TO REALLY GET TO AN ACCELERATION. AND A PRIVATIZATION. OF THE KIND OF FOR SPENDING THAT WOULD IN FACT. CONGESTION MITIGATE AND ABOUT RELIEF TO PINCH POINTS. I I'M I'M TELLING I DRIVE IT ALL THE TIME. NORTH AND SOUTH AND WHEN YOU WHEN YOU WERE HEADING NORTH ON. NINETY NINE FROM FRESNO TO MADERA EITHER IN TWO LANES I MEAN IT IS WALL TO WALL BACK UP YOU GO THROUGH MADERA YOU GET NORTH OF THERE. DON'T HELP TO GET ON THE ON THE ON THE NORTH SIDE AND INTO THE CHURCHILL AREA THEN IT THEN IT'S OPENED UP. A YOU GET INTO THE WIND AND AREA THAT COMES DOWN TO TWO LANES AND EVERYTHING IS BACKING UP. PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU'RE APPROACHING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF STOCKTON IN TO. SACRAMENTO ITSELF IT'S DOWN TO TWO THE TWO LANDS. NAM IT IS DANGEROUS AND IT IS A OF AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS BEEN WOEFULLY IGNORED. THAT IF THERE IS ANY OF. INFRASTRUCTURE PRIORITY OR ACCELERATION THE CRIES OUT IT SEEMS TO ME THIS IS. THIS IS. IS ONE WE ARE TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO I LOOK FORWARD OPPORTUNITY. OF REALLY DRILLING DOWN ON THIS AND SEEING IF THERE ISN'T. SOME MORE CLARITY WITH RESPECT TO HOW SERIOUS IS THE STATE CALIFORNIA GOING TO BE IN USING THESE THAT INCREASED TAX REVENUES. TO DO THE KINDS OF THINGS ON THE NINETY NINE THAT HAVE BEEN. SET ASIDE FOR SO SO LONG NOT APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. DOCTOR WEBER. YES. IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE GOOD THOUGH BUDGET A NEW SET SO. THAT IS UPWARD. LOOKING ESPECIALLY AFTER HAVING GONE THROUGH SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS YOU. AND DONE IN THE STATE SO IT'S GOOD TO HAVE GOOD NEWS AND AND I APPRECIATE THE GOOD NEWS WITH CAUTION. BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU STAND A GOOD UP IN THE BLACK IN TERMS OF WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH. OF HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS. YOU GAVE US A NUMBER FOUR. FOR PER PUPIL SPENDING OF A LITTLE OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND ELEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SOME ODD DOLLARS IS THAT THE FOR THE BASE GRANT OR IS THAT THE. OTHER GRANTS THAT IT THERE AND WHAT IS THE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS FOR SO. WHAT WILL BE BE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF THOSE SCHOOLS THAT HAVE LOW INCOME FOSTER KID SO FORTH AND SO ON WHAT'S THAT? WAS IS THIS ELEVEN THOUSAND INCLUDES EVERYBODY WAS A PARTIAL SOME OF IT. THE NUMBER I CITED ABOVE ROUGHLY OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND IS JUST THE PROP NINETY EIGHT PORTIONS OF FEWER TO LOOK AT ALL FUNDING SOURCES INCLUDING FEDERAL FUNDS I THINK IT'S UPWARDS OF FOURTEEN THOUSAND. OKAY OKAY SO YOU'RE WILL SIXTEEN THOUSAND MISTER BECAUSE I THINK THOUSAND FOR SOME SCHOOLS. THAT HAVE THE THOSE SOME CATEGORIES SHOULD BE SEEING THAT THAT AMOUNT BECAUSE I SAY THIS BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR HAS AS GIVEN US A CHALLENGE I THINK IN A STATEMENT ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY FINALLY. HE HAS A SAID WE NEED TO ASK WHAT ARE PEOPLE DOING WITH THOSE DOLLARS THAT ARE GOING TO THOSE CHILDREN. AND WE ARE BEEN ASKING THAT EVER SINCE WE START GIVEN THE MONEY SO IT'S GOOD TO KNOW. THAT WE NOW AS A BUDGET TO A NEED TO TALK ABOUT NOT ONLY FUNDING BUT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE FUNDS THAT WE GIVE. A SOLD THOSE SCHOOLS THAT WERE KIDS OURS ARE LEAST LIKELY TO. OR HAVE THE GREATEST CHALLENGES I SHOULD SAY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT A PROBLEM IN THE ADDITIONAL FOUR TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CHILD. IN THOSE SCHOOLS. YEAH I'VE BEEN AVERAGE LET'S READ THAT WOULD BE THE AVERAGE OKAY SO I I HOPE MY SCHOOLS IN LISTENING SO THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY WERE SCHOOLS THAT A POOR. HAVE FOSTER KIDS THAT HAVE KIDS AND LANGUAGE ISSUES THOSEKINDS OF THINGS SHOULD BE SEEING ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE PER CHILD. TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF FUNDING AND SUPPORT NECESSARY TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND THAT THAT'S A COULD THAT THAT IS HELPFUL. OKAY. LEASING RESIDENTS GET THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND WE CAN GET BACK TO WHAT THOSE NUMBERS BUT I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH SO BECAUSE. OF. WE'VE ASKED THIS QUESTION SEVERAL TIMES AND BUDGETS AND WE'VE GOTTEN THE QUESTION OF WHAT WE'RE NOT FULLY FUNDED WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WOULD NOT REALLY THERE THAT WE DON'T. KNOW EXACTLY SO NOW THE WITH THEY APPEAR. IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THESE KIDS SHOULD BE RECEIVING. AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR SCHOOLS IN TERMS OF FUNDING AND HOPEFULLY CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP THAT'S THERE SO I I APPRECIATE THAT. THE OTHER THING. YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S SOMEONE IS MENTIONED AS WITNESSED REPOSE INCOMMUNICADO IT. NOW TO MAKE IT YEAH ONLINE COMPUTER COLLEGE AND I'M GONNA HAVE MY COMMUNICATIVE BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE LOTS OF ONLINE PROGRAMS. AND SO I'M WONDERING WHAT WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF SETTING UP A TOTALLY DIFFERENT BUREAUCRATIC STRUCTURE. FULL ONLINE INSTRUCTION AYE I. YOU KNOW THAT'S THE ONLINE INSTRUCTION IS PROBABLY THEY'RE PROBABLY MORE OF A COMMUNICATIVE MAY NEVER SEE ISSUES AND UC'S. SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE RATIONALE BEHIND IT SPECIALISMS ONLINE INSTRUCTION JUST AS AN ENTITY HAS SAW MANY. CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF QUALITY AND OUTCOME AND ASSURANCE OF FOLKS THAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING THAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING. AND. SOME I'M WONDERING WHAT'S THE RATIONALE FOR THAT. THANK YOU SO WE WANT TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET THIS ONLINE COLLEGE TO INDIVIDUALS THAT REALLY ARE NOT BEING SERVED BY TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SEGMENTS RIGHT NOW THERE'S TWO POINT FIVE MILLION WORKING CALIFORNIANS. WHO ARE WORKING FULL TIME THEY HAVE CHILDREN AND THEY NEED MORE FLEXIBILITY WHICH WE BELIEVE AN ONLINE PLATFORM WILL PROVIDE FOR THEM? WERE ALSO PROPOSING THAT THERE BE IN PERSON SUPPORTS WE'VE SEEN THE RESEARCH ENOUGH COMPLETELY ON ENVIRONMENT HAVE. SOME CHALLENGES ALONG WITH IT WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE ATTENDING ONLINE PROGRAMS OUT OF STATE FOR A COST THAT'S MUCH HIGHER THAN WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY AND OTHER WESTERN GOVERNORS ARE OFFERING THESE PROGRAMS TO PEOPLE WITHIN CALIFORNIA SO WE'D LIKE TO KEEP IT WITHIN THE KICK CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THEY'RE FAMILIAR WITH SERVING THIS POPULATION OF STUDENTS AND KEEP LOW COST. IS THAT IT AND THAT'S AND THAT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND I'M I SOMETIMES WONDER. HAVING LIVED THROUGH A WHOLE LOT DIFFERENT CYCLES OF OF HER IT. THAT SOMETIMES THE. THE ISSUE IN ONLINE INSTRUCTION THAT'S OUT OF STATE IS BECAUSE OF ITS NOT THAT IS MORE ACCESSIBLE IS THAT THEY'RE PROBABLY THE FEWER DEMANDS MADE ON THE INDIVIDUAL. AND I'M WONDERING IF WE'RE GOING TO COMPETE IS YOU CAN COMPETE TO THE POINT THAT YOU GET TO THE LOWEST LEVEL. OF PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENT EQUALITY AND SIMPLY FOR THE SAKE OF COMPETING. RATHER THAN BECAUSE THEY ARE AND I SAY THIS IN BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY ONLINE COURSES THERE'S SO MANY NOT ONLY. THE OF THE PRIVATE ONES BUT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ONLINE COURSES AND I PROBABLY HAVEN'T HAD A PERSON'S WORK FOR ME WAS NOT TAKEN AN ONLINE COURSE. ALTHOUGH THE COMMUTER COLLEGES OF BUT I DO KNOW THAT OF THE OTHER PLACES THAT ARE MORE EXPENSIVE OFTEN MARKET THEMSELVES. AS NOT HAVING TO DO A WHOLE LOT OR THEY'LL COUNT ALL THE. YOUR WORK LIFE AND YOU THIS NEED THAT TOWARD THE CREDIT OF OF ONE CHEATING SOMETHING SO I'M HOPING THAT WE DON'T GET INTO THE COMPETITIVE THING. AND DISCOVER THAT IT MAY NOT BE ACCESSIBILITY AND MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE AND THEN WE FIND OURSELVES. ARE TRYING TO FIGURE WHO CAN GO TO THE LOWEST RUNG THOUGH OF PERFORMANCE AND ACHIEVEMENT. OF SO I HAVE TO I HOPE WE LOOK AT THAT CAREFULLY. IF WE TALK ABOUT FUNDING OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AT A HIGHER LEVEL TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COURSES THAT ONLINE. A THAT'S ONE THING BUT A SIMPLE BUREAUCRATIC STRUCTURE THIS STRICTLY ONLINE ABOUT IT HAS SOME CONCERNS ME. YOU HAVE ALL YOU'VE YOU'VE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF LOW OF DOLLARS FOR ALL INFRASTRUCTURE IN WORK ON. HAVE YOU PRIORITIZE IT WITH REGARDS TO WHAT PRISONS IF WE WERE TO START CLOSING PRISONS WHAT PRISONS WOULD PROBABLY BE ON THE FIRST LEVEL FOR CLOSING SO THAT WE DON'T END UP DOING GREAT REPAIRS. IN THAT I KNOW THE FANS ARE NOTORIOUS FOR DOING THAT OF A BILL TO HOLD OUT OF ONE OF THE STUFF IN SAN DIEGO MCI DE THEN SHUT IT DOWN TO HIT. THEATERS IN HOSPITAL PEOPLE NEVER DONE ANYTHING IN BUT THEY WERE BRAND NEW BECAUSE THEY WANT A LIST FOR REPAIR AND THEY MAKE SHUTDOWNS ALL THOSE REPAIRS OF JUST. A WONDERFUL FOR THE COMMUNITY PLAY WOULD BUT UMMM DID VERY LITTLE IN TERMS OF FEDERAL BUDGET SO. I HAVE WE DO WE HAVE A DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA OF OF THE PRIORITIZING THOSE REPAIRS TO THAT POINT THE ON MY COLLEGE WILL BE CREDITED. AND IT WILL BE HELD TO ALL THE SAME ACCOUNTABILITY STANDARDS IS ANY BRICKS AND MORTAR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO OBVIOUSLY OUR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ISN'T OUT QUITE YET BUT WHEN ITS OUT YOU'LL SEE SOME OF THOSE COMPONENTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT CONVERSATION AT SOMETHING WE WEIGHED VERY. HEAVILY AS WE PROP FORWARD THIS PROPOSAL DEBATED AT. MOVING ON TO CDC ARE. THIS IS OUR SECOND YEAR OF PROPOSAL I'VE FOR ROOF REPAIRS FOR CORRECTIONS I'M OBVIOUSLY AFTER WE GOT OUT THE DROUGHT AND WE INTERVIEWED THE RAINY SEASON AND AND WE HAD SOME VERY PRONOUNCED PROBLEMS ON OUR CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. AND ON THE ROOF REPAIRS REALLY CAUSING DELAYS AND PROGRAMMING AND MANY OTHER IMPORTANT ASPECTS. INSTEAD THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR THAT WE'VE WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT PRIORITIZING THE PROJECTS ON MOST IN NEED. WHAT YOUR POINT WE DO HAVE ON A PLAN? FOR AYE OUT OF STATE THAT MY COLLEAGUE GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ON THAT. CLINT COUNT APARTMENT A FINANCE SO. DEFINITELY WE LOOKED AT PRISONS THAT WE ARE NOT LIKELY TO CLOSE IN THE FUTURE BUT TECH HEAVENLY IN THAT FRAMEWORK OUT I WOULD SAY THAT. WE'RE UNDER A CONSTRAINT IN THE PRISON SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE A POPULATION CAP THAT WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH. THAT'S AT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO COUNT OUT BUT I WON'T GET INTO THAT NOW. DATE CURRENT INMATE POPULATIONS AT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND WE THINK POPULATION THERE PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN'S GONNA REDUCE THE INMATE POPULATION. BY ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED INMATES. I AM BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO EVEN IF YOU GET TO THAT PERIOD OF TIME WE'RE STILL IN THOUSANDS OF CONTRACT BEDS THAT WE. ON THAT ARE OPERATED BY CCR SO WE'RE REALLY JUST FINDING OUR EXISTING OWNED AND OPERATED INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WERE BUILT MANY YEARS AGO AND. IN DEBT DESPERATE NEED OF THESE. IMPROVEMENTS SO THAT THAT SORT OF THE LANDS WERE LOOKING OUT ON MAKING THESE AND THE STRAIGHT REPAIRS. ARE WE LOOKING AT ENDING OUR HOUSE STATE CONTRACTS ANYTIME SOON. YES THE BUDGET OUT PLANS TO GET FULLY OUT OF ALL OF OUR ARTISTIC CONTRACT BEDS IN EARLY NINETEEN TWENTY. THANK YOU. THIS IS A FELLOW PUTS A CONTRACT FIGURE FOR THE NUMBER OF PLANTS. A NUMBER OF BAD OR CURLY CONTRACTING OUT SO WHERE IN ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND OUT OF STATE BADS IN ABOUT FORTY TWO HUNDRED IN STATE BADS WE ALSO LISA FACILITY THAT'S OPERATED BY THE STATE AND THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY THREE HUNDRED BEDS. DOCTOR TOWARD YOUR FOLLOW UP. OKAY DID YOU. I GOT ON THE LIST. OKAY MISTER MATHIS. SO BUT I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO. NUMBER FONG SCUM IT'S ALONG WITH. MEMBER PATTERSON'S AND IN SEVERAL OF US HAVE BROUGHT UP. THAT THE CITY  <u><c.green>MONDAY AND</c></u> NOT SEATS YOU BUT THEY ARE. SEE INTO MONEY AND FOR SCURRY. THE FIRES THE THE CLEAN UP. AND MY BIGGEST QUESTION I THINK HERE IS WHAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS WHO WE'VE GONE FROM. DAD FORESTRY. MANAGEMENT. TO INCREASED FIRES. TO. HISTORIC MUDSLIDES. TO. THE COST OF FLOODS. TWO INCREASED ROAD COST. TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER PROBLEMS. AND ALL OF THESE. WELCOME BACK TO ONE THING. AND IT'S. IT'S BEEN SAID OVER AND OVER. BUT WE'RE NOT TAKING CARE THE FOREST THE IT'S AN ALL STARTS RIGHT THERE. IN SO. WATER THE ANALYTICS. I CHAU THAT IF WE ACTUALLY SPEND SOME MORE MONEY. TAKING CARE THE FORCE WITH WITH. BEST PRACTICES FROM FORESTERS WHO UNDERSTAND THIS THE BEST. WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY SAVE SOME MORE MONEY ON THE OTHER END? INSTEAD OF HAVING TO PAY FOR MORE CLEAN DRINKING WATER IN CLEANING UP GIANT MUD SLIDES AND WIPED OUT ENTIRE AREAS IN KILL PEOPLE AND THESE HORRIBLE FOR. WORST FIRES WE CAN ACTUALLY GO DO THE RIGHT THING ON ONE END. AND TAKE CARE THE PROBLEM UP FRONT. STATE OF SPENDING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ON THE BACK IN BECAUSE WE CAN DO THE RIGHT THING IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO NOW WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS YEAR WE'VE HAD MASSIVE CATASTROPHIC FIRES CATASTROPHIC. FLOODS MUD SLIDES THE WHOLE MIND LOSS OF LIFE. ALL BECAUSE WE SIMPLY DIDN'T SPEND THE MONEY. YEAH AT THE FRONT END OF THE FOREST. THE IN LISTEN TO THE FORRESTERS IN AND GET A RIGHT THERE. SO WHY THEY ARE THEIR ANALYTICS DON THAT SHOW HIM MAYBE IF WE ACTUALLY SPEND THAT THE MONEY TO DO THIS UP HERE. WE WERE ALL. PAY OUT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS LATER. WHAT ONE THING THAT I THINK IS HELPFUL TO TO THINK ABOUT AND THAT'S JUST MY FIRST? OKAY A ONE THING THAT'S HELPFUL TO THINK ABOUT IS AS PART OF CAP AND TRADE LAST YEAR WE HAD THE STATE RESPONSE RESPONSIBILITY AREA AND WE. WE STOPPED THAT FEET BUT. AS FAR AS SKILL IN SCOPE IT WAS ABOUT AN EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR AND PROGRAM AND SO IN ADDITION TO BACK FEELING THAT FEED THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN INCLUDED TWO HUNDRED MILLION. OF FOR ACTIVITIES THAT ARE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS DONE WITH IN THE* R. RAY FOR FIRE SAFE COUNCILS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT EXAGGERATE. ADDITIONALLY WE HAD TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO CAL LOW WE ASK FOR OUR MUTUAL AID LOCAL MUTUAL AID. SO WE HAVE PUT IN THE CURRENT YEAR SIGNIFICANT NEW RESOURCES IN FORCE MANAGEMENT AND ADDITION TO SOME OF THE BASELINE BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE FOR CAL FIRE AND OTHER ENTITIES. I THINK IT'S BEEN MENTIONED OBVIOUSLY TRUE IMMORTALITY IS. UNPRECEDENTED THAT SCALE AND SCOPE I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION A DEAD AND DYING TREES. AND SO OUR HOPE IS OBVIOUSLY THIS INFUSION OF HIGH. ADDITIONAL GTR OFF MONEY WILL HELP US DEAL WITH THIS UNPRECEDENTED DISASTER AND ARE FORCED. WHERE WHERE IS THAT FUNDING ACTUALLY GOING WITHIN THOSE BUDGET BECAUSE OF ITS IT'S ONE THING TO SAY WE'RE GONNA OF HE CALIPHATE OR? OR OR PUT IN ONE AREA BUT IT'S A WHOLE OTHER TO SAY THEM LAYS ACTUALLY GONNA BE INTERJECTED INTO CREATING FOR THREE CONTRACTS TO DO FORESTRY. DID INVEST PRACTICES IN FORESTRY VERSUS SOMETHING ELSE HE'S I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE THAT THAT'S WHERE THE KEY PROBLEM IS THAT'S BECAUSE THEN. BECAUSE LIFE IN LAND DOWN THE ROAD. THE. GTR UP FUNDS THE OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION ARE ALLOCATED TO CAL FIRE BUT THE DECISIONS ARE MADE REGIONALLY WITH CAL FIRE STAFF OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THE ISSUES THROUGHOUT OUR FORCES HAVE AS LIKE DIFFERENCES REGIONALLY. SO IT REALLY IS A LOCAL BASED OUR DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND THEY ARE GRANTS. ON THAT GO OUT. ADDITIONALLY IN PREVIOUS YEARS WE'VE INCLUDED A LOCAL ASSISTANCE MONEY FOR TREE REMOVAL AYE AND RULE COUNTIES OBVIOUSLY THE HIGH COST ACTUALLY TO REMOVE SOME OF THESE DEAD AND DYING TREES ESPECIALLY FOR. COUNTIES BEYOND FOR HOMEOWNERS FRANKLY ON THE THAT WE HAVE HOT PROPOSALS AND TO HELP OFFSET THAT COST IS ONE THE PAST. SO BACK THE REPRESSION OTHER ANALYTICS THE SHOW THE COST SAVINGS. STEVEN BENSON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AYE I DON'T YOU CAN ANSWER JUST YES OR NO YEAH I I DON'T THINK THERE'S GREAT ANALYTICS TO HAND OVER TO SAY HERE THIS THIS IS THE KIND A. OF THE. THE PAYOFF OF THE AND DOLLARS HERE IN THE FUTURE THAT I THINK WE ARE NOW IS NOT GREAT ANALYTICS. AWESOME. I ANALYTICS WERE TRYING TO CONTEMPLATE MORE SINCE IT'S COMING FROM GIGI ARE ASKED. IS. THE REDUCTION OF POTENTIAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND SO THAT THAT'S SOME OF THE INTERNAL DISCUSSION WE'VE BEEN HAVING ON TO MEASURE THE OVERALL. IMPACT THAT COULD FORCE MANAGEMENT HOUSE ON REDUCING FUTURE ADMISSION. LA JOH GOES HAVE ANYTHING NOT NOTHING THAT RIGHT NOW BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK INTO IT OKAY. GOOD FOR AND I THINK. WALTER SHOULD JUST REAL QUICK BACK TO WELL WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON TO SAY WITH THE NINETY NINE TRADE QUARTER. THE IT STILL BEYOND ME THAT. THE LARGEST AGRICULTURAL AREA IN THE ENTIRE WORLD AND IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. THAT'S PRODUCING. NEARLY SEVEN BILLION GDP WAY WHICH IS DOUBLE ANY OTHER STATE THE NATION. IS ON THAT CORRIDOR WE GET. AS THE STATE WE STILL HAVE AN. MAY THAT QUARTER ACTUAL CORRIDOR AND WE STILL HAVE THESE PINCH POINTS THAT ARE TWO LANES. I MEAN IT'S THE YOU CAN SAY IT'S. A WE DECIDE THESE THINGS OVER HERE BOYD. THAT'S WHERE RELIGIOUS FOOD COMES FROM IN HERE. THE STATE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING TO HELP MOVE. ANY OF THAT NAY IN INCREASED LENGTH CAPACITY THEIR WORDS. VERY VERY NEEDED IN IT'S BEEN SAID FOR THE LAST DECADE ON HOW NEEDED THAT IS. AND WHEN YOU TACK GAINING YOU SAY THERE'S PROJECTS THAT ARE GONNA TAKE FIVE SIX YEARS. WE SIT HERE WE GET THESE OUR POPULATION PROJECTION NUMBERS WHERE WE TALK ABOUT THE STATE TO TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE NOW. IN BY TWENTY THIRTY WE'RE GONNA BE A THIRTY MILLION BY TWENTY FIFTY WERE GONNA BE AT EIGHTY MILLION. AND. THE FACT IS AND IN WHAT ALONG WITH THOSE NUMBERS WE GET. SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF THAT GROWTH IS GOING TO GO TO THE SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. WHICH IS THAT NINETY NINE TRADE CORRIDOR. SO IT'S GONNA TAKE ALL THESE YEARS TO BUILD IT. IN THAT'S THE POPULATION PROJECTION. THEN WE NEED TO GET WITH THE PROGRAM AND START ACTUALLY CALCULATING SOME OF THAT POPULATION PROJECTION OF THOSE NUMBERS. SO IS THERE ANYTHING BEING DONE ON THAT OR WE JUST LOOKING AT WHAT WE NEEDED TEN YEARS AGO AND WE'RE STILL NOT CATCHING UP. THE SP ONE FUNDING EVERY WEEK WE'VE BEEN IN A SITUATION WHERE THE AVAILABLE FUNDING FOR. ANYHOW WE REPAIRS HAS BEEN DECLINING OVER THE LAST YOU MULTIPLE YEARS LIBS LONG AS I'VE BEEN ON THE PHONE FOR AT LEAST LAST TEN YEARS. AND. YOUNG TWO GIVEN THE OF THE FACT THAT IT'S A IT'S A PER GALLON YOU WE COLLECT EIGHTEEN CENTS A GALLON. PER GALLON IN THE GAS MILEAGE IS BEEN GOING UP SO EVEN WITH ADDITIONAL VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED ADDITIONAL POPULATION. THE NET DOLLARS HAVE BEEN GOING DOWN SO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH MONEY TO DO ALL OF THE PRIORITIES. NO. S. B. ONENESS HAS GIVEN US AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK FORWARD TO LOOK IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS AND. ADDRESS THESE DIFFERENT AREAS OF PLACES LIKE HIGHWAY NINETY NINE IS A VERY IMPORTANT TRADE CORRIDORS VERY IMPORTANT JUST CONGESTED CORRIDOR FOR PEOPLE TRAVEL. YEAH WE WERE WERE EXPANDING THE CAPACITY AS WE SPEAK I BELIEVE CDCS LOOKING AT ADDING A BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL PROJECTS JUST IN APRIL. ONTO THIS OF THE. TO THE STATE REHABILITATION PROGRAM THE CAPITAL PROGRAM. AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE WILL CONTINUE TO TO DEVELOP THAT I SENATE THAT THE. THAT. NEXT FOUR YEAR OF REHABILITATION PROGRAM WILL HAVE. ADDITIONAL TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN CAPACITY SO THAT'S THAT'S A HUGE INCREASE OVER. A TOTAL CAPACITY BEFORE A IN THE FOUR YEARS OF OF SOMEWHERE AROUND TEN BILLION SO THIS IS JUST OVER ABOVE THAT. SO DOES THE. PROGRESS IS GOING TO BE THERE PROXIMAL FORWARD AND. GET OF THE IT THERE'S GET WE HAVE. INSPECTOR GENERAL THAT MAKE SURE THAT. YOU WERE GETTING THE RESULTS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND. YOU KNOW AND THAT'S STATEWIDE. WITH THE SP ONE WEBSITE THAT THAT'S ODDITIES THAT HAS IT MUCH EASIER TO THE QUESTION. YOU KNOW THE RESULTS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WHAT ARE THE RESULTS OVERLY FOR BECAUSE RIGHT WHAT WE HAVE HERE YOU SAID IT EARLIER. MEMBER WE GO ALONG AND WE'RE FIXING THE ROADS WERE ALSO LOOKING TO EXPAND THAT WE WON'T HAVE TO TOUCH IT WANTS. WHICH GETS INTO. EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU GET INTO THE GF SIDE AND EVERYTHING ELSE. SO IF THE GOAL IS YOU ONLY HIT THAT PIECE THE HIGHWAY WANTS AND ONLY HIT ONE OF THAT IS THE GOAL THE GOAL BECAUSE THAT NEVER NOW BECAUSE OR WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN. IS WHICH MANY PEOPLE'S TAXPAYER DOLLARS. TO GO FIX A POTHOLE. AND A YEAR LATER COME BACK. IN FIX AN OVERPASS IN THE NEW YEAR LATER COME BACK AND TEAR DOWN THE OVER PASS BILL IN WHITE KNIT DO THAT'S. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHY IF WE IF WE CAN IDENTIFY THAT THOSE TYPE OF PROJECTS CAN BE DONE IN SYNERGY WE WANT TO DO THOSE PROJECTS AND SYNERGY AND TRY TO HAVE AS. AS COMPREHENSIVE A PROJECTS AS POSSIBLE. IN THE PAST WE HAVE HAD THE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THAT TYPE OF CONFERENCE OF PROJECTS WE HAVE THAT NOW. YOU KNOW AS FAR AS THE GOALS WERE LOOKING FOR S. B. ONE HAS. OF FOR SPECIFIC METRICS THAT ARE. HIGHWAY RELATED. AND YOU KNOW THE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL THE FOCUSING ON THIS FOR BUT CALTRANS HAS A WHOLE HAS. A MYRIAD OF WHAT THEY CALL LEVEL OF SERVICE RELATED. BUT ACHIEVEMENTS AND THEY'RE LOOKING TO ACHIEVING IT YEAH THAT INVOLVES. MANY DIFFERENT METRICS SAFETY METRICS. CONGESTION METRIC SMOOTHNESS. ALSO SO THERE THE. ME OTHER CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD THAT. YOU KNOW WE'VE ONLY AT THIS POINT SB ONE IS ONLY GOING TO AFFECT IT THE NEW RATES APPOINT IN EFFECT SINCE NOVEMBER FIRST. AND. BECAUSE OF THE MECHANISM FOR COLLECTING YOU KNOW THE MECHANISMS BEEN IN PLACE THAT IT'S A CONTINUING MY CAN OF REFLECTING SALES TAX WE REALLY NOT WE HAVEN'T STARTED TO SEE AND WE WON'T START SEEING TOLL SENSUALLY THIS. THIS MONTH'S DISTRIBUTION OF GAS TAX REVENUE. THE THE NEW S. B. ONE REVENUE WILL START COMING INTO PLAY NOW BECAUSE OF THAT SO. YOU KNOW A LOT OF THINGS WE'VE DONE SO FAR AS FAR AS XCELERATED PROJECTS ARE. AN ATTEMPT TO DO THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO THAT WERE ALREADY IN THE PIPE ARE IN THE PLANNING BUT YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO TO. BACK FILL THAT WITH NEW PROJECTS WELL THERE'S THERE'S TWO THINGS I'M HOPING YOU'RE COUNTING IN THE MATRIX AND THAT'S THE POPULATION GROWTH. AND ALSO THE FACT THAT THE THE FUTURISTS WOULD TELL US THAT IN TEN YEARS FROM NOW EVERYBODY WILL BE DRIVING BATTERY OPERATED THOMAS VEHICLE SAUCE BICU ONE WILL BE POINTLESS. SO I HOPE YOU GOT HER CAN. INCLUDING THAT IF I MAY WE ACTUALLY HAVE A DEMOGRAPHICS CHAPTER WHICH ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO READ IN OUR SUMMARY AND IT ACTUALLY HAS US. ONLY SLIGHTLY HIGHER THE NATIONAL POPULATION GROWTH CALIFORNIA'S ACTUALLY NOT GROWING AS IT ONCE DID AND WE EXPECT THE NEXT DOUBLING OF THE POPULATION TO TAKE PLACE IN EIGHTY FIVE YEARS. SO THAT WE ARE POPULOUS STATE THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT. DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS THAT ARE DRIVING A LITTLE BIT SLOWING OF THE POPULATION. THANK YOU. WE WILL GO ATTACHED TO THE MYSTERY AT ALL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR AYE PRESENTATIONS. I HAVE A. I HAVE A QUESTION NOW JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND I'LL TRY AND MAKE THEM BRIEF BECAUSE I KNOW TIME IS GETTING LONGER. A WITH REGARD TO A CAGE FULL FUNDING OF THE C. T. PROGRAM AND OTHERS. A PROPOSED TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO BE ALLOCATED FOR CT FUNDING WHICH I THINK IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. APPARENTLY TEACHER THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE FOR SURE. WHERE I STRUGGLE WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS PUTTING THAT MONEY NIGHT YOU PROBABLY KNOW WHERE I'M GOING IS IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE? CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE I GUESS AND WHY WOULD WE DO THAT WHAT EXPERTISE TO THEY HAPPENED IS OUR PRECEDENT FOR. FOR ALLOCATING QUE TWELVE MONEY TO ANOTHER BODY AND THEN SAY WELL IN THERE AND AND OTHERS BACK TO THE K. TWELVE BODY AND THEN WHAT EXPERTISE TO THEY HAVE CENTER. WEISS IS A GOOD IDEA. UP CERTAINLY I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION ONE PART OF THE. PIECES ACTUALLY PAY FOR A KEY TWELVE NAVIGATORS OF SOMEBODY SPECIFICALLY. WITHIN THE K. TWELVE COMMUNITY TO HELP. IMPLEMENT THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM I THINK PART OF WHAT WE WANTED TO DO WAS TO TAKE. THE CT  <u><c.green>MONEY OUT OF THE</c></u> SITE WELL I'VE JUST K. TWELVE. AND BROADEN IT TO INCLUDE FEDERAL WE OWE WHAT DOLLARS AS WELL AS WHAT WE'VE PROVIDED TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WE REALLY DO NEED A REGIONAL WORKFORCE APPROACH AND OUR HOPE IS TO INCLUDE K. TWELVE AND THAT DISCUSSION SO THAT ANY CT PROGRAMS OFFERED WHETHER IT'S THROUGH A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR A KEY TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICT. ARE REALLY ALIGNED TO THE WORKFORCE NEEDS THAT WE NOW WERE HAPPENING IN THAT REGION. AND IT ALLOWS THIS CONVERSATION TO HAVE IT HAPPEN IN CONCERT WITH INDUSTRY LEADERS WHICH WE THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT. WE THANK YOU I'M I DON'T KNOW THAT'S REAL CONVINCING TO ME BUT I KNOW WE WE'LL HAVE TIME TO DISCUSS THIS THE NAVIGATOR PROTA. I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW THAT EXPERTISE IS NECESSARILY YOUR HOUSE TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL WILL HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AT ON THE LINE. SO THANK YOU. AND MAYBE THIS QUESTIONS FOR MISTER TAYLOR WITH REGARD TO THE SURPLUS. WAS GREAT THAT WE HAVE A SURPLUS I'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO SEE IT MORE THAN THE GOVERNOR WOULD QUITE FRANKLY MYSELF. BECAUSE I WAS NOT A CITY COUNCIL OR I LAID OFF A LOT OF PEOPLE HUNDREDS. RIGHT I'VE SEEN THE BAD TIMES AND I KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE TO LOOK IN SOMEONE'S. FACE AND I CAN'T HELP YOU WE HAVE TO DO WE HAVE TO DO FOR THE BUDGET HEALTH. OF THE ENTITY AM ELECTED TO REPRESENT. SO. I AM. PRETTY FISCALLY PRUDENT AND. BUT WITH REGARD TO THIS MONEY THAT WHETHER. YOU I DON'T THEM OUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SETTING ASIDE IT DOESN'T MATTER REALLY AS MUCH AS. DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION. OR RECOMMENDATION WITH REGARD TO WHERE THAT'S MONEY PUT SHOULD BE PUT RESERVE SHOULD PAY DOWN. IS IT BETTER OFF MAYBE TO PAY DOWN DEBT BECAUSE YOU MAKE IT A THREE TO ONE RATIO IN THE OUT YEARS. CAN YOU JUST EXTRAPOLATE ON THAT A BIT SURE AGAIN IT'S SORT OF BALANCING THESE DIFFERENT NEEDS. IF YOU WANNA HAVE A BIGGER RESERVE YOU CAN BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT MAKING THAT OPTIONAL PAYMENT YOU CAN CONSIDER OTHER WAYS THAT MAYBE YOU CAN. ACHIEVE THOSE THAT SAME IMPACT OF A RESERVE FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN PUT MONEY IN YOUR DISCRETION RESERVE YOU COULD. PREPAY SOME CALPERS COST. OF THERE'S OTHER THINGS YOU COULD DO TO PREPARE YOURSELF OTHER THAN JUST THE BSA IN THE THE SFU. NOW YOU'RE ASKING THE QUESTION AS SORT OF AN ALTERNATIVE TO BUILDING UP THE RESERVE OTHER OTHER SMART THINGS THAT WE COULD DO WITH THE MONEY SUCH AS. PAYING OFF SOME THOSE DEBTS YET THAT'S THAT'S AND ALSO A SMART THING TO DO. YOU GET THE RETURN AT THIS SEVEN PERCENT AND YOU KNOW YOU PAY OFF THESE DEBTS FASTER THAT ALSO PUTS YOU IN A BETTER POSITION DOWN THE ROAD. IT'S JUST HARD TO KNOW HOW TO HOW TO BALANCE THOSE. THERE'S NO RIGHT ANSWER I THINK TO QUESTION. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE YOUR APPROACH. IN YOU YOU CONSTANTLY REMIND A LEGISLATURE THAT WERE. YEAH A DAY CLOSER TO THE NEXT RECESSION. AND. TOUGH TIMES ARE COMING SOON WITH THE MORE WE PREPARED TODAY THE BETTER OFF WE SO APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER JONES SAWYER. AND AND THANK YOU BOMB. SO AYE X. SOUGHT YOU HAD A GRAPHIC. UP THERE THAT WE'VE WE'VE HAD SAID IT STEADY GROWTH. I GUESS IT TOOK TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN YEAR WE'VE VETS SURPLUSES. THEN I JUST WENT. IS THAT ABOUT ACCURATE. CALIFORNIA FIRST CHARTS. I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE LAST TIME BUT LET ME LOOK LIKE FIRST CHART THE LAST HER ACTUALLY SHOWS OUT OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY WHAT WE'RE PROJECTING FOR BALANCE VERSUS DEFICIT. ON THAT WAS THAT THE BLACK BARS IN THE RED BARS ON THE CHARGES THAT THE CHART YOU'RE REFERRING TO I SAW A CHART THAT SHOWS. THAT SAID FOR CERTAIN TIME. WE'VE HAD SURPLUSES. IN THE BUDGET. WE'RE GONNA START JUST PUT COMPETE COULD CAN LOOK AT THAT CHART BACK UP. THIS WAS THE ONE I WAS REFERENCING BUT I DON'T THAT I DON'T THINK GROUND FUNDS. WE HAVE A RECESSION SCENARIO CHARRING. OR WILL IT PROP NINETY EIGHT. NO SCHOOL FOR. I THINK THAT'S IT BAT. AND. THIS IS ACTUALLY OUR RECESSION SONORA RIGHT BUT YOU YOU SHOWED. BIG IS THE YELLOW LINE. THE INCREASE IN THE BUDGET WAS THAT BECAUSE OF THE SURPLUS AND WE HAD A SURPLUS SINCE THAT TIME. WE HAVE A SURPLUS RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S OUR FORECAST CHINESE AGAIN. WE'VE BEEN HAVING STEADY SURPLUSES SINCE WHEN WE'VE IT I KNOW WE HAD RECESSION. WE'VE HAD A STEADY SURPLUS. LET ME DO IT ANOTHER WAY. I GOT ELECTED IN TWENTY TWELVE. EVERY YEAR IT'S MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE BEEN ELECTED IN TWENTY TWO YEAR TWENTY TWELVE. ONE. MOST OF US ALL OF US GOT TWELVE YEARS INSTEAD OF SIX. WE'VE HAD A STEADY S. AUTOMATICALLY THAT. SURPLUS IS THAT RIGHT OR WRONG. COURTESY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THAT'S CORRECT SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. THIS SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET WAS THE FIRST HOUR WE HAD TO LOOK FOR IS THE SOLUTIONS. THANK YOU. NO I. I WOULDN'T SAY SOMETHING ELSE BUT. SINCE THAT TIME I KNOW WE'VE WE MAKING SOME PRUDENT DECISION SINCE THEN. TO TO ENSURE FOR THE NEXT. FOR THE NEXT SHORTFALL A RECESSION. I WAS GONNA GO THERE AND SAY SINCE I'VE BEEN ELECTED WE HAD NOTHING BUT GOOD BUDGET BUT YOU KNOW WHAT JUST ME. BUT THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE HERE IS. I KNOW WE'RE EXPECTING GLOOM AND DOOM. BUT I I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE RIGHT LET'S NOT. MISTAKEN IN THIS IS IS THE FACT THAT. WE'VE HAD STEADY INCREASES AND AS SOME MY COLLEAGUES HAVE POINTED OUT. WE'RE LOOKING AT PRUDENT WAYS TO BECOME IS RECESSION PROOF AS POSSIBLE WHETHER IT'S PAYING OFF THE DEBT. RAINY DAY FUND THAT WE ARE. ACTUALLY TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN WHAT DID THE NEW TWELVE YEAR MEMBERS. BECAUSE IT IS MORE LIKELY WE WILL BE HERE. DURING THAT TIME IF IT EVER COMES WHEN IT COMES AND THAT. WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAD WE YOU USED TO TAXPAYERS MONEY. GOV PRUDENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS BEST WE CAN WITH THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. AND THAT MAY SOUND MORE STATEMENTS ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER BUT. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE GOT THAT OUT THERE. TO. I'VE HAD I'VE DONE AUDITS. WHERE WE CAN LOOK AT? THE WAY WE SPEND. THE TAXPAYERS MONEY. AND HOPEFULLY SOME THESE AUDITS THAT. WE'VE DONE HAVE BEEN HELPFUL IN YOU DEVELOPING THE BUDGET I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A CRITICISM. OR DISCUSSION ABOUT US HAVING MORE HEARINGS ON HOW EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT WE SPEND THE MONEY. THE MONIES THAT WE HAVE NOT GIVEN IT ONE EXAMPLE. I AM. I'VE I'VE MET I'VE OF ASSEMBLY INVOLVED WITH PUBLIC SAFETY CHAIR PUBLIC SAFETY ALSO. BUDGET PUBLIC SAFETY. I'M REALLY CONCERNED ESPECIALLY AFTER TALKING WITH THEM. CDC SEE OUR. ANNA CCPOA IN A CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVE THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. THERE WE HAVE BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF CDC ARE HOW EFFECTIVE THEY REALLY ARE NOT PLANTED. TO S. AN AUDIT OF ALL CDC OUR PROGRAMS. BECAUSE IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET IS OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING FOR GRANTS FOR REHABILITATION. THIS IS REALLY GREAT THAT WE'RE PUTTING MONEY TOWARDS THAT BUT I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO BE. FOCUSED ON EVEN MORE SO IS HOW EFFECTIVE AS MY. COLLEAGUE FROM ELK GROVE LIKES TO SAY. YOU KNOW WE HAVE PROGRAMS IN CDC ARE LIKE ROCK CLIMBING. I DON'T OF ROCK CLIMBING. IS AN EFFECTIVE USE OF THE WAY WE NEED TO USE THE MONEY. AND QUITE FRANKLY I'M JUST NOT CRITICISM ON IF THERE IS A ROCK FRANK CLIMBING CLASSES SINCE IN. AND OUR CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES I'M NOT CRITICIZING IT I JUST WANT TO KNOW. WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE EFFECTIVE. AND THEY DO HELP TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM BECAUSE ON THE BACK END AS WE START TALKING ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVELY WE UTILIZE. OUR OUR PRISONS WHETHER WE CLOSE THEM. OR WHETHER WE TRANSFER THEM TO BECOME MEDICAL FACILITIES INSTEAD OF CLOSING THEM OR. OR REHABILITATION FACILITIES STEAD OF CLOSING THEM. WHEN WE HAVE THAT CONVERSATION I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE DO MOVE INTO THAT AREA. THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE ARE IN THE BENCHMARKS THAT WE SET UP FOR. OUR ARE EFFECTIVE AND SO MY QUESTION IS DO THESE. AUDITS HELP YOU. TO. DEVELOPED A BUDGET AND SHOULD WE INCLUDE YOU. AND THE DISCUSSION OF WHAT THE PARAMETERS OF OF OF AUDIT SHOULD BE SAID YOU COULD BETTER. DO THE BUDGET OR THAT SOMETHING BOTH FINANCE IN. HELLO LA OH WANNA STAY AWAY FROM MORE. WE WELCOME THE DISCUSSION A WOULD SAY I WAS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN AN AUDIT THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING EXTENSIVELY WITH I ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUB SIX. ACTUALLY AND WHAT WE CALL OUR MISSION BASED BUDGETING AND DEVELOPING CERTAIN DEPARTMENTS TO LOOK AT AND WHICH WE LOOK AT EFFICIENCIES AND. REVIEW THE CORE MISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT TO YOUR POINT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE BEING UTILIZED EFFECTIVELY. AND SO WE WE DO LIKE LOOKING AT EFFECTIVENESS AND WE WELCOME THE CONVERSATION. OKAY AND THEN ANDI DE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE I WOULD LIKE. AS A FORMER. DIRECTOR WILL STAY FOR THE CIVILIZED I KNOW WHERE WOEFULLY BEHIND WHEN IT COMES DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON ALL GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS IT'S JUST SOMETHING. THAT DURING BAD BUDGET TIMES WE JUST IGNORE AND HOPE THAT THE BUILDING DOESN'T FALL DOWN AROUND OUR EARS. AND SO. I WOULD LIKE TO BE PART OF THAT DISCUSSION BECAUSE WHAT I FOUND. IS SOMETIMES FOR NOT VERY GOOD AT. DEVELOPING HOW WE'RE GOING TO TO HANDLE FIXING ROOFS IN. KITCHENS YOU KNOW I'VE I SAW ONE BUDGET PROPOSAL. FOR LIKE A BUCK TEN MILLION DOLLAR KITCHEN. I YOU THINK. ON TV THEY HAVE KITCHEN DEBT THAT EXPENSIVE. BUT. IT MAY NEED ALL THAT AND I. WOULD LOVE TO BE INVOLVED. IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE SOMETIMES. DO SOME WAYS TO DO IT BOMB. I DON'T SEE CHEAPER BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT. IT BENT CHEAPLY YOU WANTED DONE ALONE MORE EFFICIENTLY AND AND IN A BETTER USE OF OF THE DOLLARS. AND. AND THAT'S IT FOR NOW. SO. IF YOU CAN HELP ME WITH HOW WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE REHABILITATION DOLLARS. BECAUSE WE PROP FIFTY SEVEN FORTY SEVEN AND OO. GET THE MONIES WON'T STOP THEM THANK GOD FOR ALL OF THESE AND SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN WORK WITH YOU. SORT OF IMPROVE THATFOR EVERY DOLLAR WE SPEND ON REHABILITATION WE SAVE MONEY WE NEED TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO IT. SO CAN ACTUALLY MEET SOME OF THESE GOALS LIKE CLOSING PRIVATE PRISONS THE FOUR THOUSAND HOW THE STATE. FORTY TWO HUNDRED AND STATE TWENTY THREE HUNDRED LEAST. THERE'S A ONE WEEK CLOSE BY TWENTY TWENTY. IF WE'RE EFFECTIVE ON A REHABILITATION PROGRAM WE CAN CLOSE THAT AND PROBABLY REDUCE THAT NUMBER DOWN. ON INCARCERATED SIDE YEAH IS SIMILAR WE JUST RECENTLY PUT OUT A REPORT ON REHAB PROGRAMS. SO WE'D BE VERY HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND AND THE THRUST OF IT WAS WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS OPERATING. SINCE THEY HAVE SOME MORE MONEY NOW. ARE THEY EVIDENCE BASED HAVE THEY BEEN SHOWN TO WORK. BUT THAT'S JUST A NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE OPERATING THEM. IN WAYS THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL YOU CAN'T JUST SAY YOU'RE RUNNING THE PROGRAM. BUT THE METRIC SEVENTH SO WE'D BE VERY HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND I HOPE THAT REPORT WILL HELP YOU PROVIDE SOME GUIDANCE FOR YOU TO. AN ELASTIC ON THAT WHEN I'VE ASKED FOR EFFECTIVENESS OF ON REHABILITATION PROGRAMS ALAS. SO IF SOMEONE STAYS OUT FOR YEAR DEBTS WE USE TO BE SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT WAS SAFE BY THINGS UP EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND OR MORE THAT WE SPEND ON PEOPLE INCARCERATED. THEY DON'T COME BACK THAT'S WHAT WE SAVE. AND WHEN I ASK HOW DO YOU DO YOU CAN YOU KEEP RECORDS OF THAT AND SOMEONE WILL TELL ME NO WE CAN'T. AND THEY'LL TELL THEM WHAT THEY PAY THEIR STATE TAXES ARE PRETTY GOOD. YOU PRETTY SURE THAT THEY HAVE NOT. GONE BACK TO A LIFE OF CRIME. SO ONCE YOU GO AND CHECK. WITH THESE PEOPLE WHO DO OUR STATE AND GET THAT INFORMATION YOU FIND OUT WHAT INMATES. FORMER LEE INCARCERATED ARE NOW LONG LONGER CAMINO CRAP THAT'S A SAVINGS TO BATTLING TO TO THE STATE BUT IS ALSO REVENUE. TO THE STATE BY THEM PAYING THEIR TAXES. AND SOMEONE WILL GO OH. I KNOW WE COULD DO THAT. SO DO ALSO SOME REALLY EASY WAYS WE CAN. TERMIN HOW EFFECTIVE THESE PROGRAMS ARE AND HOPEFULLY CAN YOU CAN WORK WITH ME SO WE CAN IDENTIFY THAT BE HAPPY TO. THANK YOU. MISTER BLOOM. THANK YOU I DON'T KNOW. MISTER BLOOM GOING TO SIT. DOWN. SORRY THROUGH ITS DOUBLE THE. CONFUSION COMING UP TO TWO MORE TO MORE DOCTOR WHAT'S OUR. THANK YOU. AND. MS CONSTANT MISTER TAYLOR SCRIPTED SEE YOU AGAIN I'M. BACK FOR MY SIX DUH SUCCESS OF. BUDGET IF. IF I'M COUNTY CORRECTLY AND I'M. GLAD TO TO BE HEARD THE WORKING WITH YOU AGAIN ITEM I I WANTED TO REITERATE TO SOME OF THE. COMMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUES MADE ABOUT THE COURT'S EARLIER ON IN OUR DISCUSSION AND. I. AM VERY CONCERNED THAT THE COURTS COMPARED TO OTHER DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE ARE LAGGING FAR BEHIND. IN RESTORATION OF FUNDING IF YOU LOOK AT. EVEN CONSIDERING A LOT OF THE REFORMS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE. MEANTIME BUT IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THE BASELINE FUNDING THAT EXISTED. AT THE TIME THE RECESSION HIT THE CONDITION OF THE COURTS WERE AND WHICH WAS GREAT THEN. COMPARED TOHOW WE'VE RESTORED MONEY AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT THERE IS MORE MONEY THIS YEAR IN THE BUDGET THAN PAST YEARS. BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO ASSESS HOW FAR ALONG WE ARE IN RESTORING THE COURTS TO WHERE THEY SHOULD BE. AUTUMN AND I'M. WONDERING IF I. YOUR DEPARTMENT CAN SHED TO EITHER YOU CAN SHED LIGHT ON THAT. AND THEN THAT ARE ALSO ON THE COURTS WHEN IT COMES TO INFRASTRUCTURE I WAS STRUCK BY THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM SALINAS ABOUT A COURT THAT SHE KNOWS IN THAT I'VE HEARD ABOUT IS A MEMBER OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. ACCORD THAT. NEEDS WORK AND ISN'T EVEN ON THE LIST OF SEVENTEEN COURTS THAT IS SLATED FOR FUNDING OVER. APPARENTLY SOUNDS LIKE OVER THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OR SO. AND SO THAT CONCERNS ME BECAUSE I KNOW THAT A LOT OF OUR. COURTS HAVE BEEN STRAPPED FOR A. I CASH THAT THEY NEED TO DO ROUTINE MAINTENANCE AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. AND AND TO IN MANY CASES THE COURTS ARE LITERALLY HELD TOGETHER BY BAILING WIRE AND AND THAT DUCT TAPE TO EVER. ISN'T ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IN OUR COURT SYSTEM SOMEONE OR IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. THINK ANY MAJOR ARRESTS AND WHATSOEVER TO FINANCE A THINK AND JUST AS THE COMPARISON POINT AGREE THAT WERE NOT AT THE LEVEL THAT WE'RE FULLY REFUNDED OUT IN PRIOR YEARS I'M. GOING BACK TO SEVEN EIGHT WE WERE OUR TRIAL COURTS REFUNDED ABOUT AND THREE POINT THREE MILLION AND WERE NOW I'M JUST UNDER THREE MILLION IN OUR PROPOSED BUDGET. I AM I DON'T KNOW THAT WERE NECESSARILY TRYING TO GET BACK TO A CERTAIN LEVEL BUT TRYING TO MAKE INVESTMENTS BASED ON THE WORKLOAD IN CASE THAT THAT'S BEFORE THE COURTS AND NOW. I AM GOING TO START WITH GILLIAN. ASSUME THAT WAS A SLIGHT MISTAKE I APOLOGIZE I ASSUME THE WORKLOAD IS ONLY INCURS. THAT BE CORRECT. I THINK SO I MEAN THERE HAS DEFINITELY BEEN CHANGES BETWEEN AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY IN THE DATA WITH IN FRONT OF ME BETWEEN. AND I CRIMINAL CASE FILENE'S ON CIVIL CASE EILEEN'S I'M ALL OF THOSE THINGS CERTAINLY HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME AND THAT IT'S SOME DEPEND ON THE AVAILABILITY AND ACCESS TO COURT SERVICES. AND THERE'S A LOT MORE SELF REPRESENTED LIBERTY LITIGANTS IN THE COURT SYSTEM NOW WHICH WE'VE MADE A LOT OF INVESTMENTS IN THAT AREA TO TRY TO HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS. THAT OTHERWISE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET. ACCESS TO THE COURTS SO RECOGNIZING THAT WERE WERE TRYING TO MAKE STRIDES IN THIS AREA BUT. AREN'T NECESSARILY. AIMING TO GET BACK TO A CERTAIN FUNDING LEVEL I WANT TO COMMEND YOU ON A PROVIDING MORE FUNDING FOR SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS IT IS AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT. WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT PROVIDING THAT HELP IS ONLY ONE PIECE OF THE. OF OF THE OF THE PUZZLE IF A SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS. CAN'T GET A COURT DATE AND HAS TO COME BACK NUMEROUS TIMES IN ORDER TO HAVE. A IS A HER ISSUE RESOLVED. WE'RE NOT DOING A THEM A PARTICULARLY. A SELFLESS REPRESENT LITIGANTS ARE TYPICALLY PORT THAT'S WHY THEIR SELF REPRESENTED. THEIR LOSING TIME FROM WORK OUT OF THEIR SCHEDULES THEY'RE HAVING TO TRAVEL. LONGER DISTANCES THAN THEY DID IN THE PAST BECAUSE WE CLOSE SO MANY COURTHOUSES AND SO I I DO THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO BE. ASSESSING. WHAT OUR PLAN IS FOR RESTORING THE COURTS TO THE PLACE THAT THEY NEED TO BE NOW THE? COURTS HAVE DONE THAT OF SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT WE ARE DOING. AS A LEGISLATURE AND IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BRANCH TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES I JUST. LEAVE YOU WITH WITHOUT THAT I THINK VERY IMPORTANT. COMMENTS ON THE SECOND QUESTION I WANTED TO ASK AND. I SUPPOSE IT'S A IN THE IN THE NATURE OF A BOTH A COMMENT AND A AND A QUESTION. OF HAS TO DO WITH THE EARLIER DISCUSSION ABOUT. THE. A RAINY DAY FUND AND AND AND AND THE RESERVE. AND I THINK THAT. FOR FOR MOST MEMBERS WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A GOOD THING THAT WE'RE DOING IN A NECESSARY THING TO PROTECT AGAINST. ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN NEXT BUT WHAT. IS LEFT AND SAID HERE. WHICH TOUCHED ON IS THE VOLATILITY OF OUR REVENUE STREAMS AND WHAT IS LEFT UNSAID IS WHAT WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THAT VOLATILITY. IN THE FORM OF TAX REFORM. OUR OUR OUR REVENUE STREAMS ARE VOLATILE IN PART. BECAUSE WE RELY ON AN ANTIQUATED SYSTEM THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN APPROVE OF OF REVENUE GENERATION THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATE GENERATIONS AGO BUT WE'VE DONE NOTHING TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION. AND. I'M WONDERING WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDS TO ADDRESS THAT IN THIS BUDGET OR PERHAPS IN THE GOVERNOR'S STATED THE STATE. OF THURSDAY'S GOT ONE MORE OPPORTUNITY IT IS MY OPINION THAT I THINK. MANY HAVE A SEAT NEED FOR THAT KIND OF REFORM BUT THAT IT IS GOING TO TAKE LEADERSHIP FROM THE. TOP TO REALLY MAKE IT HAPPEN. THANK YOU OBVIOUSLY AS I SAID THE FEDERAL TAX REFORM HAPPENED TO HAVE WHEN WE ARE PAST OR INTERNAL PUBLICATION DEADLINE HOWEVER CERTAINLY THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT A LEGISLATIVE MEASURES MOVING THROUGH RIGHT NOW. TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU'VE OUTLINED THAT BECAME MORE PRONOUNCED CANDIDLY AFTER THE FEDERAL TAX REFORM SO WE'RE BEGINNING TO LOOK INTO EACH OF THOSE LEGISLATIVE MEASURES AND I'M HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS CARRYING THOSE BILLS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR CHOI THAN DUCT WORK. OKAY THANK YOU FOR WAITING. NOW HUNGRY TIME ON MOST OF A CLOCK. I FOR ONE ON MY QUESTIONS. I'M IN A NEW AREA IN GENERAL. THIS IS MY SECOND YEAR. DEALING WITH THESE ARTISTS BUDGET. IS SUDDENLY YA VERY. GOOD THEN THE POSITIVE EXPERIENCE SAID THAT WE DO WE HAVE A SURPLUS BUDGET. RATHER THAN DEFICIT. WHICH IS GOOD THE HOWEVER I'M WONDERING ALL THIS SOCCER. A BUDGET EXPENDITURE PROPOSED OR SOUGHT AFTER WE SEE AND THEN ALSO A LOT OF QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED TO. WHEN THE GOVERNOR US. A FACE ESOS O. SUCH A HUGE. A SEPARATE US SO I WONDER WHETHER IT IS SEE THE ONE NO. BY HIMSELF LA SETTING THE PRES BOROUGH HALL TO SUPPRESS WOULD BE HANDLED OR. A. DEAL I HAVE FOUR OR OR. YOU OFF HIS. MAKES SUGGESTIONS. THE THOUGHT DOESN'T JUST MAIS GENERAL CURIOSITY HOW. WHAT WHETHER THERE'S ANY ANY PRINCIPLE BECAUSE OUR? I AS YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU'RE GONNA SPEND THAT MONEY YOU CAN SPEND THAT ANYWHERE. BUT THE MY THINKING IS THAT TERM. AND SINCE WE HAVE. ASSIST YOU IT I THINK THAT THREE WAY SO MAYBE WE CAN THINK WAY IS SO OBVIOUSLY. A DID YOU SAY THAT THE FOUR FIFTHS OF PR SURPLUS HAVE BEEN US. PUT INTO RAINY DAY OF RESERVES. SO WHICH IS SOMEONE ONE WAY. AT THE OTHER ONE AND IS. AND TO. PAYOFF FOR. BUT THAT DEBTS. THAT THE WE WE HAVE A SISTER SO. PUBLIC OPINION OUR LIABILITY YEAR LIKE APPROVES. A PENSION LIABILITIES SO HUGE WHAT THE TWENTY SEVEN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS SO INSIDE OF ME. A THAT'S DOWN A BECAUSE AT THAT OBVIOUSLY WOULD YOU CUT DOWN THE IN INTEREST COSTA. AND THEN ALSO THE OTHER FACILITIES. I WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHEN ARE YOU. AND PSEUDO QUESTIONS. OUT REGARDING THE. PRISON FACILITIES SO. SINCE I HERE HARM PROFIT. PRISONS SO. ANA CONTRACTED DOWNFALL WHERE INMATES ARE. SO THAT IN CASE OF THAT DOWN WE ARE IN SHORT OF OUR. PRISON FACILITIES. THERE IS SO SURPLUS IS SO WE'VE KNOWN WITH THIS ARE. OUT COULD BE ONE TIME WHILE COULD BE ONGOING BUT IS SO SO HERE WE CANNOT. DENY THAT NGUYEN INDEFINITELY CONTINUE. BUT THE CONSTRUCTION CAN BE ONE TIME NON FACILITY AND THE. THOUGHT IT CAN BE DONE AND AIR HALL HOW MANY ROOMS CAMBIA. BUILT TO WITH THE. AVAILABLE FUNDS OF BUT THE ADRIATIC CAN BE A GOOD. USE UP A ONE TIME FUN. SO. IN PRINCIPLE. WHERE AND A HALL WITH THE SURPLUS IS WOULD BE USED SELF RATHER THAN LISTENING TO ALL DIFFERENT ARE? A DEPARTMENTS SO HEY WE NEED THIS MONEY DISAPPEAR NUYS SO. BUT I THINK THERE HAS TO BE SOME. BASIC A PHILOSOPHY HOW TO APPROACH. IN DEALING WITH A SUCH AS ALONG SUPPRESSES BUT. I'M NOT GOING BACK MY FIRST QUESTION. OF HOW DOES HE DECIDE IN DEALING WITH A SURPLUS EXPENDITURES. THANK YOU SO I HAD DURING THE HOLIDAYS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME WITH THE GOVERNOR DEVELOPING THE BUDGET BASED ON THE REVENUES IN THE FORECAST THAT WE HAVE IN MIND. I WOULD NOTE THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE BUDGET SEASON WE'VE OBVIOUSLY GIVING YOUR OUR BUDGET PROPOSAL YOUR SUB COMMITTEES WILL MEET AND CONFER ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU AGREE WITH OUR PRINCIPLES AS WE. MOVE TOWARDS THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE OF PASSING THE BUDGET ON JUNE FIFTEENTH. I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET IS BASED ON. IT'S NOT JUST THE SURPLUS YOU TO LOOK AT THE NATURE OF THE SURPLUS AND MUCH DRIVING IT EONS ON TO THE ANALYST EARLIER POINTS. OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A POINT IN TIME WHEN WE HAVE TO PUT THE BUDGET TOGETHER TO ACTUALLY LITERALLY SEND IT TO THE PRINTING PRESS AND WE'RE STILL GATHERING MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE NATURE OF REVENUES AND WHILE THEY'RE COMING AND HIGHER BUT WE KNOW A LOT OF ITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE. PERSONAL INCOME TAX AND CAP GAINS. THEREFORE YOU HAVE TO WONDER IF ITS ONGOING SURPLUS OR FITS ONE TIME IN NATURE AND IN OUR ESTIMATION WE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER THIS DOCUMENT WAS REALLY ONE TIME THE NATURE. AND SO THAT'S WHY OUR PRINCIPLES ARE REALLY. PRUDENT IN BUILDING UP THE RESERVE IS WELL AS LIMITING MANY OF OUR EXPENDITURES TO THOSE THAT ARE ONE TIME IN NATURE. BECAUSE OF. IS SURPLUS IS OBVIOUSLY ENOUGH FOR REVENUE. YOUR PAST RECORD THAT. I SEE IS THAT. NOT GENERAL FUND SPENDING HAS GROWN. AT THE NEARLY THREE TIMES THE RATE OF INFLATION IN CALIFORNIA. SOURCE SINCE WE HAVE MONEY LESS SPENDING SO I THINK. IF DIAZ STATE BUDGET. HAS GROWN AT THE RATE OF ONLY INFLATION. THE. BUDGET ORDER BEEN. SELECTED OVER ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IS UP ARE. A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S RIGHT THERE WE COULD HAVE A SAFE THE THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. SO WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE EXPERTS EIGHT EXPENDITURE AWAY OR FOR AWHILE. INFLATION RATE. I THINK WHEN THE ANALYST DEVELOPS THE ONE PAGER ON BUDGET FORMULAS THAT WILL ILLUMINATE SOME OF THAT AS SOME OF THIS IS CASELOAD DRIVEN. I THOUGHT OF IT IS THAT OUR PROGRAMS OUR CASELOAD DRIVE AND I AND THE OTHER THING IS THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE OBVIOUSLY AND IT DRIVES OFF OF. A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT FACTORS INCLUDING OUR AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE AND YEAR OVER YEAR GROWTH IN REVENUES. SO. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT AND HAPPEN ON THE NATURAL AS REVENUES COME IN. AND I THINK THAT ONE PAGE WILL PROVIDE YOU SOME ADDITIONAL DETAIL ON SOME OF THOSE THINGS THAT AND HAPPENED REALLY ON THE NATURAL. COMMENTS. SURE I THINK AS MISS COSTA SAID YOU. YOU TYPICALLY WILL HAVE TO INCREASE EXPENDITURES FOR INFLATION THEIR PROP NINETY EIGHT FORMULA HAS THAT SORT OF IMPLICITLY BUILT IN ALONG WITH ENROLLMENT GROWTH. THE LEGISLATURE'S ALSO MADE YOU KNOW ITS OWN DECISIONS ABOUT ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT ONE. MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES. AFFECTED THE STATE. I DECISIONS TO ADD ADDITIONAL SERVICES OR ADDITIONAL HOURS IN. AYE H. ASSESS. ADDED MOMENT GROWTH IN YOU SEE I MEAN THESE ARE JUST DECISIONS THE LEGISLATURE MAKES EVERY YEAR. AND IT TENDS TO HAVE SPENDING GROW T AT GREATER THAT INFLATION. JUST LOOKING AT THE. THIS IS RELATES TO REALLY MISTER OBERNOLTE QUESTION. THE LAST THREE YEARS IT LOOKS LIKE GENERAL FUND SPENDING GREW AT ABOUT ONE PERCENT FOUR PERCENT. SIX POINT TWO PERCENT AND SELL PROPOSED FOR FOUR POINT ONE PERCENT. THOSE ARE ROUGHLY IN LINE WITH YOUR REVENUE GROWTH. SO IT'S JUST YOUR DECISIONS THAT YOU MAKE ABOUT HOW YOU ALLOCATE THAT MONEY. GOVERNOR US OUT A PROPOSED A BUDGET THAT INCLUDES SELF. FOUR HUNDRED. NEW POLLUTION SAW OUT WITH THE CALTRANS ISSUE WE ARE. HAVE A HEART ABOUT THE. THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE INEFFICIENT THE OPERATIONAL CALTRANS. NOW IS SO. INEFFICIENCIES OR BECAUSE OF THE PIPE AND YOU EMPLOYEES ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE RATHER THAN STREAMLINING WHILE FINDING SOME. BETTER WAYS OF IMPROVING THE SERVICE SO. THAT THAT THIS HAS SOUGHT JUST THOUGHT ADDING ONE TOP OFFER IN. ARE. INEFFICIENT OPERATIONS. I WOULD NOTE TWO POINTS. ONE WERE PROPOSING A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN SP ONE OF SEVEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS NOT SIMPLY REQUIRES ADDITIONAL PEOPLE. AS MY COLLEAGUE MISTER WELLS MENTIONED ALSO WE RECENTLY APPOINTED AN INSPECTOR GENERAL ONTO CALTRANS TO OVERVIEW THESE PROJECT DOLLARS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE BEING SPENT EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IS WHEN YOU SPENDING SEVEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IT DOES REQUIRE ADDITIONAL. ON EMPLOYEES EMPLOYEES THAT WE WOULD UTILIZE THROUGH THE BOND FUNDS VERSUS GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. ON AND SO THAT'S OUR. OUR INCREASE STAFF LOAD IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECTS WE THINK WILL BE FUNDED IN THE BUDGET YEAR. IS THAT THE FOUR HUNDRED NEW EMPLOYEES A SUCH A PROPOSED THAT BECAUSE SUFFER SP ONE PASSED A IMPLEMENTATION. THAT'S CORRECT. YOU NEED THE GOVERNMENT TO. BUT ASSEMBLYMAN WE'VE OBVIOUSLY RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT CALTRANS STAFFING LEVELS IN THE PAST. SO WE'LL BE TAKING A LOOK AT IT IT'S NO QUESTION THAT THEIR WORK LOAD WILL INCREASE. THE QUESTION WAS DID THEY HAVE THE PEOPLE ALREADY THAT. COULD HANDLE THIS WORKLOAD SO WE'LL DEFINITELY TAKING A LOOK AT THAT. OKAY IF YOU'RE THERE ARE. FINAL IS JUST AS I I I DON'T THINK WE CAN. THE FIND ANY SOLUTIONS HERE. I COME FROM US HERE FOR IRVINE AND. DOES TOOL TO HELP WHICH IS YOU CAN. YOU YOU CAN GO BY NUMBER ONE IS SO INCREASING YOUR OWN STAFF OR CONTRACTING OUT. MANY SERVICES ARE DOWN FROM MY STUDIO EXPERIENCE US CONTRACTING OUT THIS SAVED US A LOT OF OUR MONEY. HAVE HAVE YOU ARE THE HAVE THE CATCHER AND THOUGHT ABOUT THEM OF CERTAIN PORTIONS A WORKER CAN BE CONTRACTED OUT THERE BY THE TEN INCREASING THE IN ALL TO EMPLOYEES A SIZE OF THE CALTRANS. STATUE ACTUALLY SPECIFIES HOW MANY CONTRACT EMPLOYEES WE CAN UTILIZE ACCOUNT UP CALTRANS. BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR CHOI. DOCTOR WHAT. ABOUT COUPLE HOPEFULLY QUICK THINGS FOR YOU SO. WITH THE. PASSAGE OF. CONTINUE RESOLUTION IN CONGRESS THAT FUNDS CHIP. WHAT IS THE BUDGET AND WHAT IS THE ROUGH AND I DON'T I SHOULD HAVE BEEN FROM A FIGHT PROJECTS THAT DON'T WOOD IS ONE OF THE ROUGH BUDGET IMPLICATIONS FOR CALIFORNIA? OBVIOUSLY THE POSITIVE SO. HOW DID YOU GET IT WOULD BE A WITH WHAT IS THE NUMBER THAT WILL BE? ABOUT. I'M ALL ALONE MY STAFF BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS IS LATE BREAKING NEWS BUT ALREADY WHEN WE PASSED AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET FOR PUBLICATION WE KNEW THAT WE WOULD BE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION TO THE GOOD BASED ON HOW WE HAD BUILT IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS. I'M OBVIOUSLY AND THIS LINKED OF AN EXTENSION IS GREAT NEWS FOR US AND WE JUST STARTED REVIEWING THE BILL SO WE HAVE SOME ROUGH NUMBERS ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS ON HIM TO HEAR. YEAH UNDERSEA DEPARTMENT BY IT SO. HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE ONE QUARTER THAT THEY DID ON THE SHORT TERM BASIS AND SO OUT WE ALREADY KNEW WHEN WE RELEASED THE BUDGET WE'RE GOING TO BUILD THAT INTO MAY. AND FRANKLY THE RATES AND THE POPULATION IN THAT PROGRAMISN'T CHANGING SO DRAMATICALLY THAT I DON'T THINK THAT I THINK THAT ONE FIFTY PER QUARTER IS A PRETTY GOOD RULE OF THUMB SO. IN OTHER WORDS IF WE'RE GONNA GET EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT FEDERAL SHARE I'M IN THE BUDGET YEARS WELL YOU COULD PROBABLY MULTIPLY THAT NUMBER BY FOUR GET ROUGH SETS. AND AND THIS IS MORE COMMENTARY I GUESS. THE. A VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET. GRANTS THAT CALIFORNIA WILL BE ADMINISTERING TO HELP WITH. SOME OF THE FORCE IF YOUR FUEL FORCE CHALLENGES WE HAVE. CONCERNED THAT ACTUALLY THAT NUMBER MAY BE LOW. FROM WHAT WE WHAT WE ACTUALLY NEED BUT ALSO CONCERNED THAT THE GRANT PROCESS MIGHT BE ONEROUS AND DIFFICULT AND SLOW. AND. NOT NOT TO IT AS AS IT IS WITH A LOT OF AGENCIES ARE NOT JUST PICKING ON CALPERS ON MY CALVET THIS POINT BUT. BUT IS THERE ARE GOING TO BE AN EMPHASIS HELP EXPEDITE THAT PROCESS THE PEOPLE WE CAN ACTUALLY SPEND THIS RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY PROTECT. LIVES AND PROPERTY AND AND OUR FORESTS OR WILL THIS BE. MORE OF A TYPICAL PROCESS. WE ACTUALLY HAD AN EXEMPTION FOR ALL PROGRAMS FUNDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR ADDED GIGI ARE AT FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT ONTO YOUR POINT TO KIND OF ACTS BUT AT SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS GOING OUT SO I'M AND CERTAINLY THE CAL FIRE PROJECT IS ONE THAT WOULD APPLY. FOR THAT EXEMPTION. AND JUST YOU KNOW IT WEIRD AS YOUR TALK ABOUT METRICS EARLIER AND AND CONCERNS. I REPRESENT THE AREA THAT HAVE THE TUBS FIRE. WHICH UNTIL THOMAS FIRE WAS THE THE MOST EXPENSIVE FIRE IN THE STATE. AND AND I THINK ONE OF THE. THE CONCERNS THAT THAT I'VE HAD IN AWHILE WHILE THIS FIRE WAS UNIQUE I IN THAT THEY ALL ARE BUT. WE LOST A LOT OF FORCE LAND WE ALSO IS IS DIFFERENT AND SOME OF THE OTHER FIRES THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE SIERRAS. WE'RE HOPING I'M HOPING AT SOME POINT. THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD PROVIDE SYMMETRIX SO WE UNDERSTAND THE. THEIMPLICATIONS OF TO GREENHOUSE GASES WHEN THESE LARGE FIRES ERUPT I MEAN ANECDOTALLY WE'VE HEARD THAT. WHEN THESE LARGE FIRES. EXCEEDS OR EQUALS. THE ENTIRE. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM TAILPIPE EMISSIONS FOR A SINGLE YEAR AND WE HAD. MULTIPLE EVENTS THIS YEAR AND SO THAT BRINGS MY QUESTION IS ARE WE. ARE WE GETTING OUR BANG FOR OUR BUCK HERE ARE QUITE FRANKLY I EXPERIENCED IN MY DISTRICT THE WORST AIR QUALITY EVER RECORDED. EVER RECORDED YET. WHEN IT COMES TO OUR ALLOCATIONS FROM THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OF WHICH I REPRESENT A LOT. WE DON'T GET THE RESOURCES BECAUSE OF THE. AND VIRUS SCAN AND THE WAY THINGS ARE CALCULATED. SO. I WAS LOOKING FOR RECOGNITION THAT. WOW THERE'S A THIS AIR QUALITY IS REALLY BAD AND THERE SHOULD BE RESOURCES HERE AND THAT THERE'S A RECOGNITION THAT THIS ACTUALLY IS A CONTRIBUTOR TO GREENHOUSE GASES. AND WHAT THAT NUMBER REALLY AS BECAUSE. I'D YOU KNOW I'D I JUST WORRY THAT THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE BUT THE PROCESS THAT MAKE UP THERE. BUT I JUST FEAR THAT IS REALLY REALLY NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH. SO A MAN ONLY DEPARTMENT FINANCE AGAIN. A PART OF THE KAPPA DRITTE EXPENDITURE. STRUCTURE IS THAT. EVERY YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION RELEASES AN ANNUAL REPORT TO PROVIDE. INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE INTO THE PUBLIC IN TERMS OF THE OUTCOMES THAT HAS. RESULTED AS A RESULT OF THE EXPENDITURES OF CAPITATE FUNDS IN WITHIN THAT IS A ESTIMATION OF GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECTS THAT ARE FUNDED. IF YOU LOOK HISTORICALLY AT THE HEALTHY FOREST PROGRAM THAT'S ADMINISTERED BY. CAL FIRE. THAT IS ONE OF THE MORE COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS NOT ONLY BECAUSE. OF WHAT YOU WERE ALLUDING TO WHICH IS THE. AVOIDANCE OF. OF. EMISSIONS ASSOCIATE WITH FIRES BUT THE CARBON SEQUESTRATION BENEFITS OF. OF TREES SO IT'S KIND OF A WIN WIN ON MULTIPLE LEVELS THAT. YOU NO REDUCES RISK IN TERMS OF PUBLIC SAFETY IT REDUCES EMISSIONS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE. WITH WILDFIRES AS WELL AS THE. HAS CARBON SINK BENEFIT SO. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. WE HAD SUCH A MAJOR INVESTMENT IN THE HEALTHY FORCE PROGRAM WAS A FOR THAT VERY REASON YOU ALLUDED TO. I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND HOPE ON ONGOING BASIS THAT WE CAN. MORE OF THAT I YOU KNOW IT WE HEAR THAT STUFF I'VE HEARD FROM. DEBT THAT PEOPLE IN CARD SOME OF THEM ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THESE FORCE FIRES OR ACTS OF GOD. I WOULD DISAGREE I THINK THAT WE HAVE MADE SOME OF THE SITUATIONS WORSE UP BY OUR INABILITY TO MANAGE FORESTS. AND. AND SO SO I'M JUST LOOKING I'M A NUMBERS PERSON I WANT TO SEE THE NUMBERS I WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH CARBON CAN BE SEQUESTERED WHEN WE ACTUALLY DO THESE PROJECTS. ALSO UNDERESTIMATE HOW MUCH CARBON WE BLOW OFF WHEN WE HAVE THESE BIG FIRES I WANT TO SEE THOSE COMPARISONS BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SPENDING. THE RESOURCES TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF GREENHOUSE GASES KNOWN THAT BUT ALSO TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF OF AIR POLLUTION AND IF YOU'D SPENT. THREE OR FOUR WEEKS IN MY DISTRICT YOU GET IT. PEOPLE WANDERING AROUND WITH MASKS ON. FOR FOUR WEEKS ON FOR WEEKS BECAUSE OF THE POOR AIR QUALITY. AND AND. I SWEAR RECOGNITION THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE. FROM THAT AGENCY. AND APPRECIATES COME FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BUT I'M NOT HEARING THAT FROM THAT AGENCY. AND I'D LIKE I'D LIKE A RECOGNITION OF THAT. THANK YOU DON'T WORK. UP MR SWITCHING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR UP MS COST I. INTENDED TO BRING THIS UP EARLIER BUT GOING BACK TO THE ISSUE OF. K. THROUGH TWELVE OF FUNDING. THAT YOU YOU YOU. STATED THAT. YOU KNOW THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ARE BEING ASKED TO. EXERCISE THERE GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN GREATER LOCAL CONTROL TO. TO MEET THEIR FINANCIAL CHALLENGES BUT AGAIN ó YOU KNOW I REPRESENT. DISTRICTS FROM LAUSD THE LARGEST URBAN SCHOOL DISTRICT IN ONE OF THE. BIGGEST RECIPIENTS OF CONCENTRATION A SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT DOLLARS AS WELL AS SUBURBAN DISTRICTS THAT RECEIVE. LESS OF THOSE. SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION DOLLARS BUT THEY'RE BOTH SAYING THAT THE BASS GRANT IS INADEQUATE TO MEET THEIR BASE. THEIR BASIC COSTS. AND SO I LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION OUR GOAL UP UNTIL THIS POINT STUDENT BEN TO FULLY FUND THE FORMULA WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IN. IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND AND WE HAVE HEARD. DISTRICTS TALK ABOUT THE BASS GRANT SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THEIR STIRS COST. A AND WE HAVEN'T OPINES BEYOND GETTING TO THE HUNDRED PERCENT IMPLEMENTATION OF LCF. OKAY IMAC. I'M WORKING WITH. THE EDUCATION STAKEHOLDERS TO. TO FOCUS ON THAT ISSUE OF THE INADEQUACY OF THE BASS GRANT. AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BECAUSE A A A AGAIN. DO NO DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE URBAN AS WELL AS SUBURBAN ROLE THERE ALL SAYING THAT THE BASS GRANT IS INADEQUATE TO MEET THEIR BASIC COSTS. AND. YOU KNOW IN THESE BUT A GOOD BUDGET TIMES THEY'RE THEY'RE PROJECTING MANY ARE PROJECTING QUALIFIED BUDGETS. A TWO THREE YEARS OUT AND SO THAT WAS LAST YEAR I I DON'T KNOW HOW THE FULL FUNDING OF THE PROPOSED FULL FUNDING OF LCF F.. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH DATA MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT. THE AYE AYE AYE AYE I'M HOPING THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS HERE LARA CLEAR AND I KNOW THAT I'VE I'VE HAD OPPORTUNITIES TO. SPEAK WITH THE. MEMBERS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON ON THIS IS. I. I JUST WANTED TO. EMPHASIZE THAT THAT ISSUE AS AN ONGOING ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. UP AGAIN THIS IS THE FIRST OF WHAT WILL BE NUMEROUS HEARINGS YES THERE WILL BE MORE HEARINGS MORE HEARINGS. LAST YEAR WE DID A SMALL NUMBER HEARINGS NINETY EIGHT TO BE EXACT SO UNDER A HUNDRED. AND WE WILL BE VERY EXCITED TO GO THROUGH EACH AND EVERY PIECE OF THIS BUDGET AND SUBCOMMITTEE. MISTER BILL MURRAY HAS MANY MARCHING ORDERS AND TRANSPORTATION SO IT'S GOOD. THAT WILL BE LOOKING GUY VERY MUCH FORWARD TO THIS AYE PROCESS AS WE DO EVERY YEAR AND. WE ARE A LOT I'M I'M JUST VERY FOR CHICAGO OF DISSEMINATED THE COMMITTEES. SO ARE WE WILL ON. RECONVENED IN THE NEXT. FEW MONTHS BUT WILL BE OBVIOUSLY GOING THROUGH A VERY DELIBERATE PROCESS AND THANK YOU. ON THIS COSTA MISTER TAYLOR FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. WITH THAT WE ARE ADJOURNED
