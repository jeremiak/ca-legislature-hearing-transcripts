OF 28% IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:11.831

COLLEAGUES THERE IS CLEARLY

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:51.737
REDUCED OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE

BUSINESSES THAT. THROUGH THE

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:59.011

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:01.113
TO THE PASSAGE OF PROP TWO OH

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.584
NINE. THE DISPARITIES ARE FELT

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.519
EVEN DEEPER IN HIGHER EDUCATION

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:09.322

RIVERSIDE BECAUSE IT'S THE MOST

00:21:02.661 --> 00:21:04.563
DIVERSE CAMPUS. THEIR PARENTS

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.566
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT BUT THE

00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:08.166
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN

00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:10.102
YEAR OLDS KNEW THAT. BECAUSE

00:21:10.168 --> 00:21:12.304
THE WORD HAD FILTERED DOWN

00:21:12.371 --> 00:21:14.473
WHICH CAMPUS WAS THE MOST.

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:16.942
DIVERSE FRIEND SO WE ULTIMATELY

00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:19.044

BETWEEN THE H. B. C. USE AND

00:21:21.079 --> 00:21:22.347

PIPELINE INTO MBA PROGRAMS ON

00:21:38.096 --> 00:21:39.631
PARTNERSHIP. WHEN WE FIRST

00:21:39.698 --> 00:21:42.000
STARTED DOWN THAT ROAD WE GOT

00:21:42.067 --> 00:21:43.935
PUSHED BACK FROM THE SENATE

00:21:44.002 --> 00:21:46.004

BECAUSE WE HAVE DECADES OF

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.185
REASONS TO KNOW WHY THIS IS THE

00:22:00.252 --> 00:22:02.821
RIGHT THING TO DO. OUR STUDENTS

CAMPUSES AND OUR ADMISSIONS

00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:08.060

ON TO GET THE CORRECT JUST A.

00:22:39.825 --> 00:22:42.294
DESCRIBE SO I HIT I'VE ALREADY

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.195
MENTIONED ON THE FLOOR AND

00:22:43.261 --> 00:22:46.932
PREVIOUS OUTSIDE TALKS THAT I.

00:22:46.998 --> 00:22:47.833
GREW UP IN A VERY SEGREGATED

00:22:47.899 --> 00:22:50.602
TOWN EVERYONE PRETTY MUCH LOOKS

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:52.971
LIKE ME FOR THE DUE TO THE FACT

00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:54.973
THAT THEY WERE COVENANTS IN THE

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:55.674
TOWN AND PEOPLE CAN LIVE THERE

00:22:55.741 --> 00:22:58.276
ANYWAY. SO WHEN I WENT TO

00:22:58.343 --> 00:22:59.845
COLLEGE AT UC BERKELEY IN THE

00:22:59.911 --> 00:23:03.515
EARLY SEVENTIES I WAS A VERY.

00:23:03.582 --> 00:23:05.751
IT WAS IT WAS A NEW WORLD FOR

00:23:05.817 --> 00:23:09.221
ME BECAUSE THERE WERE PEOPLE OF

00:23:09.287 --> 00:23:11.189
EVERY CLASS IN COLOR. AND THERE

00:23:11.256 --> 00:23:14.025
WERE A LOT OF BLACK STUDENTS AT

00:23:14.092 --> 00:23:18.263
CAL AT THAT TIME. AND OVER TIME

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.799
BY STATE I GOT BOTH MY DEGREES

00:23:20.866 --> 00:23:22.934
AT UC BERKELEY AND I THEN ENDED

00:23:23.001 --> 00:23:24.870
UP WORKING ON THE CAMPUS SO I

00:23:24.936 --> 00:23:26.705
WAS ON THAT CAMPUS ON A DAILY

00:23:26.772 --> 00:23:30.575
BASIS FROM THE EARLY SEVENTIES

00:23:30.642 --> 00:23:32.711
UNTIL THE MID NINETIES HAND

00:23:32.778 --> 00:23:35.213
OVER THAT TIME PERIOD I SAW A

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.849
REMARKABLE CHANGE IN THE

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:39.684
DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE CAMPUS

00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:44.823
WHERE IT IS- IT DID NOT REFLECT

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.392
WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE NOW I CAN'T

00:23:47.459 --> 00:23:50.495
FULLY DESCRIBE THAT ALL OF THE

00:23:50.562 --> 00:23:53.231
STUDENTS OF COLOR WHO WERE

00:23:53.298 --> 00:23:54.766
THERE. WHEN I WAS THERE IN THE

00:23:54.833 --> 00:23:57.736
EARLY SEVENTIES FELT. FULLY

00:23:57.803 --> 00:24:02.207
WELCOME TO IN FOLEY- INCREASED

00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:04.342
BUT I CERTAINLY OBSERVED OVER

00:24:04.409 --> 00:24:09.080
TIME THAT LESS AND LESS

00:24:09.147 --> 00:24:12.117
ESPECIALLY BLACK STUDENTS FELT

00:24:12.184 --> 00:24:13.318
AT ALL COMFORTABLE AT UC

00:24:13.385 --> 00:24:16.421
BERKELEY BECAUSE INEVITABLY

00:24:16.488 --> 00:24:18.123
THEY WOULD BE THE ONLY BLACK

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:20.125
STUDENT IN THE CLASS IN A

00:24:20.192 --> 00:24:22.327
PARTICULAR COURSE WERE THE ONLY

00:24:22.394 --> 00:24:24.095
BLACK STUDENT IN THEIR MAJOR

00:24:24.162 --> 00:24:25.997
UNLESS THEY WERE IN ETHNIC

00:24:26.064 --> 00:24:28.200
STUDIES MAJOR FOR EXAMPLE. YOUR

00:24:28.266 --> 00:24:30.368
THE ONLY BLACK STUDENT IN THEIR

00:24:30.435 --> 00:24:34.873
PARTICULAR HOUSING. SETTING

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.210
THAT IS NOT RIGHT AND I ALSO

00:24:38.276 --> 00:24:40.779
WATCHED WHERE THE DIVERSITY OF

00:24:40.846 --> 00:24:44.683
FACULTY HUGELY CHANGED HUGELY

00:24:44.749 --> 00:24:48.353
CHANGED. NOT TO A GOOD END AND

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.856
NOT REFLECTING THE DEMOGRAPHICS

00:24:50.922 --> 00:24:57.162
OF OUR STATE. SO IT'S BACK IN

00:24:57.229 --> 00:24:58.396
TWENTY THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN MY

00:24:58.463 --> 00:25:00.165
TOWARDS THE END OF MY TERMS IN

00:25:00.232 --> 00:25:01.800
THE ASSEMBLY THIS ISSUE WAS

00:25:01.867 --> 00:25:03.902
BROUGHT UP THAT WE SHOULD RE

00:25:03.969 --> 00:25:06.504
LOOK AT TWO NINE AND WE SHOULD

00:25:06.571 --> 00:25:08.240
PUT IT ON THE BALLOT AND GET

00:25:08.306 --> 00:25:11.543
RID OF TWO NINE. AND IT WAS

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.912
ISSUE USING THE TERM DIFFICULT

00:25:13.979 --> 00:25:16.915
IS TO IS- IT IS A NICE WAY TO

00:25:16.982 --> 00:25:20.785
DESCRIBE THE AT THE- PAIN FOR

00:25:20.852 --> 00:25:22.721
CONVERSATIONS THAT OCCURRED

00:25:22.787 --> 00:25:24.723
AROUND THIS SUBJECT AT THAT

00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:28.159
TIME. BUT I AM VERY VERY HAPPY

00:25:28.226 --> 00:25:31.062
THAT WE HAVE. THAT THE PROGRESS

00:25:31.129 --> 00:25:32.898
THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN THAT

00:25:32.964 --> 00:25:34.599
DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SINCE

00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:36.635
THEN I APPRECIATE THAT THERE

00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:39.237
ARE STILL RESIDENTS CALIFORNIA

00:25:39.304 --> 00:25:41.039
WHO MAY NOT SEE THE VALUE. THE

00:25:41.106 --> 00:25:42.674
IMPORTANCE IN THE ESSENTIAL

00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:44.910
NESS OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BUT

00:25:44.976 --> 00:25:47.712
I THINK I THINK THAT SO MANY

00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:50.415
MORE PEOPLE HAVE NOW SEEN THAT

00:25:50.482 --> 00:25:53.385
WE HAVE NOT BEEN SERVED BY THAT

00:25:53.451 --> 00:25:55.921
BY TWO NINE WE HAVE NOT BEEN

00:25:55.987 --> 00:25:58.723
SERVED. AND I WAS VERY VERY

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:03.595
PROUD THAT THE ENTIRE UC SYSTEM.

00:26:03.662 --> 00:26:05.730
GOT BEHIND AND SUPPORTS THE

00:26:05.797 --> 00:26:08.333
REPEAL OF TWO NINE AND I

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.404
STRONGLY URGE AN AYE VOTE.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:17.342
SENATOR WES SO. THANK YOU

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:19.678
MEMBERS YOU KNOW PROP TWO OH

00:26:19.744 --> 00:26:20.845
NINE I REMEMBER THIS VERY CLEAR

00:26:20.912 --> 00:26:21.813
WHEN THIS INITIATIVE WAS PUT

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.348
FORWARD THIS IS WILL SOMETHING

00:26:23.415 --> 00:26:24.849
THAT GOT ME ACTIVATED CIVIC

00:26:24.916 --> 00:26:26.851
KLAY WORKING ON A CAMPAIGN

00:26:26.918 --> 00:26:29.587
OPPOSES MEASURE AND I WAS VERY

00:26:29.654 --> 00:26:31.289
DEEPLY SADDENED WHEN OF CAST

00:26:31.356 --> 00:26:33.325
AND LESS MORE SAID AND WHEN I

00:26:33.391 --> 00:26:35.427
HEARD THAT- 60% OF THE LATINO

00:26:35.493 --> 00:26:36.962
COMMUNITY ACTUALLY VOTE FOR IT

00:26:37.028 --> 00:26:38.964
WHEN I SPOKE TO BE SUPPORTED.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:41.299
HE DIDN'T UNDER WHAT PROP TWO

00:26:41.366 --> 00:26:43.802
OH NO WASN'T. ABOUT THEY SAID

00:26:43.868 --> 00:26:45.103
ALL THIS IS ABOUT GETTING THE

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:46.104
BEST TENANTS IN OUR SCHOOLS

00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:47.472
AND- BUT WE WERE ALREADY DOING

00:26:47.539 --> 00:26:49.474
THAT. WE WERE ALREADY DOING

00:26:49.541 --> 00:26:51.743
THAT SO PROP TWO OH NINE DID

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.745
NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. PROP TWO

00:26:53.812 --> 00:26:56.715
NINE JUST BOND. THE HANDS. OF

00:26:56.781 --> 00:26:59.751
OUR UNIVERSITIES. TO PROVIDE

00:26:59.818 --> 00:27:02.687
DIVERSITY ON THE CAMPUSES WHAT

00:27:02.754 --> 00:27:03.822
HAS RESULTED SINCE PROP TWO OH

00:27:03.888 --> 00:27:05.924
NINE. CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC

00:27:05.991 --> 00:27:08.793
UNIVERSITIES ARE THE LEAST

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.062
DIVERSE IN THE COUNTRY. WHEN

00:27:11.129 --> 00:27:14.132
YOU LOOK AT THE LIST OF THE TOP

00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:16.234
FIFTEEN MOST DIVERSE CAMPUSES.

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:18.169
THEY'RE NOT IN CALIFORNIA NOT A

00:27:18.236 --> 00:27:19.938
SINGLE ONE OR ARE PUBLIC

00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:21.272
UNIVERSITIES BUT WE DO HAVE

00:27:21.339 --> 00:27:23.241
STANFORD ON THERE WE HAVE U. S.

00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:25.110
C. ON THERE WE HAVE PRIVATE

00:27:25.176 --> 00:27:27.345
UNIVERSITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT

00:27:27.412 --> 00:27:29.314
ARE DOING A BETTER JOB. OF

00:27:29.381 --> 00:27:31.416
INTERGROUP THEIR CAMPUSES THEN

00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:34.219
ARE VERY PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES.

00:27:34.285 --> 00:27:35.720
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THIS

00:27:35.787 --> 00:27:37.489
LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE VERY

00:27:37.555 --> 00:27:40.191
CONCERNED ABOUT. THIS IS

00:27:40.258 --> 00:27:41.860
SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIANS

00:27:41.926 --> 00:27:44.329
SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF. BECAUSE

00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:47.599
WHEN PROP TWO OH NINE WAS

00:27:47.665 --> 00:27:49.534
ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA GUESS

00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:50.702
WHAT HAPPENED. VICE LIKE A

00:27:50.769 --> 00:27:53.538
SICKNESS PROP TWO NIGHT

00:27:53.605 --> 00:27:56.374
AFFECTED OTHER STATES YOU HAVE

00:27:56.441 --> 00:28:00.011
STATES LIKE. LIKE WASHINGTON IN

00:28:00.078 --> 00:28:02.480
MICHIGAN AND THE BRASS CAN ERA

00:28:02.547 --> 00:28:04.282
ZONA OKLAHOMA FLORIDA NEW

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:05.617
HAMPSHIRE FOLLOWED CALIFORNIA

00:28:05.683 --> 00:28:07.118
TO DO THAT TO THEIR PUBLIC

00:28:07.185 --> 00:28:09.421
UNIVERSITIES BUT WHEN WE THINK

00:28:09.487 --> 00:28:11.056
ABOUT HEY WE THINK ABOUT RACISM

00:28:11.122 --> 00:28:14.192
WE USUALLY DON'T THINK ABOUT

00:28:14.259 --> 00:28:16.661
THOSE STATES WE THINK ABOUT THE

00:28:16.728 --> 00:28:18.229
SOUTHERN BELTS THAT. THOSE HAVE

00:28:18.296 --> 00:28:20.465
THESE THESE POLICIES YOU WOULD

00:28:20.532 --> 00:28:20.999
EXPECT THEY WOULD BUT THEY

00:28:21.066 --> 00:28:25.270
DON'T. SO WHY ARE WE THE STATE

00:28:25.336 --> 00:28:28.440
OF CALIFORNIA. WHY DO WE

00:28:28.506 --> 00:28:30.475
DISCRIMINATE ARE AGAINST OUR

00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:32.210
OWN PEOPLE MORE THAN ANY OTHER

00:28:32.277 --> 00:28:33.745
STATE WHY WE WERE FOR WHY WERE

00:28:33.812 --> 00:28:36.247
WE FIRST BECAUSE WERE THE MOST

00:28:36.314 --> 00:28:39.084
EVER STATE. AND WE HAD ELEMENTS

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:40.452
IN THE STATE THE SOUGHT TO

00:28:40.518 --> 00:28:42.220
ADVANCE THESE POLICIES TO KEEP

00:28:42.287 --> 00:28:44.656
OUT THECERTAIN PEOPLE OUT OF

00:28:44.722 --> 00:28:46.424
OUR UNIVERSITIES AND YOU KNOW

00:28:46.491 --> 00:28:47.725
WHAT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN IT'S

00:28:47.792 --> 00:28:49.160
BEEN EFFECTIVE. AND IT'S JUST

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:51.262
MORALLY WRONG THAT'S NOT

00:28:51.329 --> 00:28:53.631
SOMETHING THAT THELEGISLATURE

00:28:53.698 --> 00:28:55.500
SHOULD STANDING BY. NOT

00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:56.634
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD

00:28:56.701 --> 00:28:59.337

00:36:25.182 --> 00:36:26.083
KNOWING THIS HISTORY MAKES ME

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:28.819

00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:34.525

00:40:37.668 --> 00:40:40.504
HOW DO WE REALLY QUALITY. WE

00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:41.705
NEED TO IMPROVE OUR EXISTING

00:40:41.772 --> 00:40:43.541
SYSTEM AND INSTITUTIONS LET'S

00:40:43.607 --> 00:40:45.676
LOOK AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS. OUR

00:40:45.743 --> 00:40:46.877
PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE LETTING DOWN

00:40:46.944 --> 00:40:48.712

00:40:48.779 --> 00:40:50.614
VULNERABLE AREAS OF THE STATE.

00:40:50.681 --> 00:40:52.149
TOO MANY LOW INCOME MINORITY

00:40:52.216 --> 00:40:53.350

EDUCATION THEY DESERVE IN

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:56.220
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY GRADES.

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:59.323
FOR EXAMPLE. 21% OF AFRICAN

AMERICAN STUDENTS WHO GRADUATED

00:41:01.859 --> 00:41:03.494

00:41:09.266 --> 00:41:11.936
74% OF ASIAN STUDENTS. THIS IS

00:41:12.002 --> 00:41:14.738
NOT ACCEPTABLE. WE OWE IT TO

00:41:14.805 --> 00:41:15.806
THE STUDENTS TO PUSH FOR

00:41:15.873 --> 00:41:17.875
COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL REFORMS

00:41:17.942 --> 00:41:19.844
AND FUNDING SO ALL OUR STUDENTS

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:20.344
ARE PREPARED FOR HIGHER

00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:22.246

00:41:22.313 --> 00:41:23.881

ENSURING KIDS RECEIVE THE BEST

00:41:26.183 --> 00:41:28.552

US RESIST CHANGE. NOW IS THE

00:41:32.489 --> 00:41:34.725
TIME FOR THIS CHANGE. MEMBERS I

00:41:34.792 --> 00:41:36.227
MENTION IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO

00:41:36.293 --> 00:41:36.894
THAT WE HAD THE CHINESE

00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:38.629
EXCLUSION ACT. IT'S NOT THAT

00:41:38.696 --> 00:41:39.897
LONG AGO WE HAD LAWS THAT

00:41:39.964 --> 00:41:41.365
EXPLICITLY HEARD AFRICAN

00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:44.068
AMERICANS. AND THE LEGACY OF

00:41:44.134 --> 00:41:45.870
THESE LAWS CONTINUE WITH US.

00:41:45.936 --> 00:41:46.837
THERE ARE WAYS WE CAN BREAK

00:41:46.904 --> 00:41:48.706
THIS UP. JUST CONSIDER RIGHT

00:41:48.772 --> 00:41:50.374
NOW YOUR ZIP CODE IS THE VISIT

00:41:50.441 --> 00:41:53.344
BECAUSE THE TERMINATION OF HOW

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:53.944
GOOD YOUR EDUCATION WILL BE IN

00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:56.213
SCHOOL. IF THE MOM IN A LOW

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.414
INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD WANTS TO

00:41:57.481 --> 00:41:58.849
SEND YOUR CHILD TO SCHOOL

00:41:58.916 --> 00:42:00.551
ACROSS TOWN THAT PROVIDES A

00:42:00.618 --> 00:42:02.219
BETTER PROGRAM FOR HER CHILD.

00:42:02.286 --> 00:42:04.855
SHE'S FOR BRIDGE FOR BILLION

00:42:04.922 --> 00:42:05.456
FROM ALLOWING HER CHILD TO GO

00:42:05.522 --> 00:42:07.658
TO THAT SCHOOL. WE HAVE DECADES

00:42:07.725 --> 00:42:10.227
OF LAWS. RIGID INSTITUTIONS AND

00:42:10.294 --> 00:42:11.962
ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

00:42:12.029 --> 00:42:13.464
DETERMINE WHERE YOUR ZIP CODE

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:15.432
WILL BE BUT NOW YOUR ZIP CODE

00:42:15.499 --> 00:42:16.033
DETERMINES WHAT EDUCATION YOU

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.269
WILL GET. THIS IS WRONG AND WE

00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:20.905
NEED TO FIX IT. EVERY TIME A

00:42:20.971 --> 00:42:22.206

00:42:22.273 --> 00:42:24.074

00:42:25.376 --> 00:42:27.177
MORE PUBLIC SCHOOL OPTIONS IT

00:42:27.244 --> 00:42:29.880
IS RESISTED BY TOO MANY OF US.

00:42:29.947 --> 00:42:31.548
SOME WHO LIVE IN NICE

00:42:31.615 --> 00:42:32.182
NEIGHBORHOODS WITH SCHOOLS THEY

00:42:32.249 --> 00:42:35.052
ARE HAPPY WITH. I HAVE TO GIVE

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:41.492
ODDS AND DESERVES CREDIT FOR

00:42:41.558 --> 00:42:45.562
THAT. MEMBERS A HUNDRED AND

00:42:45.629 --> 00:42:46.697
FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE

00:42:46.764 --> 00:42:47.698

00:42:51.101 --> 00:42:53.103
THESE VOICES BEFORE WE PROCEED.

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:54.872
THIS BILL IS RACING TO BEAT THE

DEADLINE TO GET ON THE BALLOT

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.809
BUT IT'S WORTH SLOWING DOWN.

00:42:58.876 --> 00:42:59.777

00:51:16.807 --> 00:51:18.341
TIE FAIRS. WE ACTUALLY HELD A

00:51:18.408 --> 00:51:20.444
HEARING ON THE GLASS CEILING

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:23.113
FOR ATI. BECAUSE WHAT WE'LL SEE

IS THAT WELL CERTAIN SUBGROUPS

00:51:25.615 --> 00:51:29.052

PROFESSIONS AND HIGHER

00:51:35.892 --> 00:51:37.561
EDUCATION AGAIN ONLY SOME SUB

00:51:37.627 --> 00:51:40.597
SEGMENTS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT

00:51:40.664 --> 00:51:44.334
UPPER MANAGEMENT AND COMPANIES

00:51:44.401 --> 00:51:47.704
OR PROFESSIONS RIGHT EVEN MY

00:51:47.771 --> 00:51:49.539
OWN PROFESSION OF MEDICINE AND

00:51:49.606 --> 00:51:52.175
A PHYSICIAN YOU LOOK AROUND AND

00:51:52.242 --> 00:51:54.411
YOU START LOOKING AT THE

00:51:54.478 --> 00:51:57.581
DEPARTMENT CHAIRS AND THE DEANS

00:51:57.647 --> 00:51:59.049
AND YOU DON'T FIND A WHOLE LOT

00:51:59.115 --> 00:52:00.383
OF A. B. I. UP THERE IN FACT

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:03.520
THERE ARE NO ATI MEDICAL SCHOOL

00:52:03.587 --> 00:52:05.355
DEANS. IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:52:05.422 --> 00:52:09.359
THINK ABOUT THAT. ALL RIGHT-

00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:10.727
YOU HAVE OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:13.396
SOME MEDICAL SCHOOLS IN US AND-

00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:14.164
SO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE WELL

00:52:14.231 --> 00:52:16.666
REPRESENTED- BUT WE SAW THAT

00:52:16.733 --> 00:52:18.635
THIS IS ALSO THE CASE AND LAW

00:52:18.702 --> 00:52:20.704
IN TECHNOLOGY LOT OF API

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:22.539
ENGINEERS ON THE BOTTOM RUNGS

00:52:22.606 --> 00:52:23.406
SOMEHOW THEY DON'T SEEM TO GET

00:52:23.473 --> 00:52:26.643
PROMOTED. AND I DON'T THINK. I

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:28.712
DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S BECAUSE

00:52:28.778 --> 00:52:31.948
WE'RE NOT TALENTED ENOUGH.

00:52:32.015 --> 00:52:35.485
RIGHT I DON'T THINK IT'S

00:52:35.552 --> 00:52:36.653
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TALENTED

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.222
ENOUGH TO DO SO MAYBE SOMETHING

00:52:39.289 --> 00:52:41.157
ELSE IS AT PLAY AND I THINK

00:52:41.224 --> 00:52:42.659
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY

00:52:42.726 --> 00:52:44.127
THE BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITY

00:52:44.194 --> 00:52:47.230
HAVE NOTICED AS WELL NOT ONLY

00:52:47.297 --> 00:52:47.797
FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR OTHER

00:52:47.864 --> 00:52:51.134
PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND SO IF WE

00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:53.169
WHAT COMES THE ACA FIVE IT'S

00:52:53.236 --> 00:52:55.071
GREAT TO TALK ABOUT A QUOTE

00:52:55.138 --> 00:52:57.908
UNQUOTE COLOR BLIND- PROCESS OR

00:52:57.974 --> 00:53:02.445
SOCIETY BUT WE KNOW IT'S- NOT

00:53:02.512 --> 00:53:04.247
COLOR BLIND IT'S BLINDNESS

00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:06.683
TOWARDS STRUCTURAL RACISM. AND

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:09.819
THAT DOES NOT BENEFIT OUR STATE

00:53:09.886 --> 00:53:11.288
AND CERTAINLY DOESN'T BENEFIT

00:53:11.354 --> 00:53:15.025
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I

00:53:15.091 --> 00:53:17.961
HOPE THAT WE WILL ALL JOIN

00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:20.363

TOOLS. TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS.

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:40.584
THIS ONGOING PROBLEM A

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:42.485
STRUCTURAL RACISM THAT MEANS

00:53:42.552 --> 00:53:44.087
THAT PEOPLE DO NOT ACTUALLY

00:53:44.154 --> 00:53:48.825
HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. AND IF.

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:04.687
WAS AUTUMN AND I CAN THESE

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:06.355
YOUNG KIDS LEARN ALL THE WAY

01:07:06.422 --> 01:07:08.991
UP. THAT SHADE TREE MECHANIC

01:07:09.058 --> 01:07:10.092
RULE AND THEY KNOW EVERYTHING

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:12.361
ABOUT CARS THEY HAVE NO DESIRE

01:07:12.428 --> 01:07:13.129
TO GO TO COLLEGE THEY WANT TO

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:15.331
BE ABLE TO GO TO A TRADE OR

01:07:15.398 --> 01:07:16.265
TECHNICAL SCHOOL THAT WILL

01:07:16.332 --> 01:07:17.633
ALLOW THEM TO LEARN A TRADE

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:18.868
THAT VANCE THEM IN THEIR

01:07:18.934 --> 01:07:21.203
CAREER. BUT WE IN THIS BUILDING

01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:23.672
PAST POLICIES THAT STOP THAT

01:07:23.739 --> 01:07:25.241
FROM HAPPENING. I IMPLORE. TO

01:07:25.307 --> 01:07:26.575
FOLLOW WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM

01:07:26.642 --> 01:07:28.210
DIAMOND BAR SAID. THERE IS AN

01:07:28.277 --> 01:07:29.345
ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:07:29.412 --> 01:07:31.180
ADDRESSED ABOUT EDUCATION AND

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:32.948
HIGHER EDUCATION. THERE IS AN

01:07:33.015 --> 01:07:34.083
ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:35.451
ADDRESSED ABOUT RACISM. BUT THE

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:37.052
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS BILL

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:39.221
DOES NOT DO IT THIS BILL ONLY

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:41.457
REPEALS. WHAT THE STATE AND THE

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:42.892
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA VOTED FOR

01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:44.193
WHEN THEY STOOD PROUDLY IN

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.895
VOTED FOR THIS BILL. IT SAID

01:07:45.961 --> 01:07:46.796
THAT THEY WILL NOT

01:07:46.862 --> 01:07:50.166
DISCRIMINATE. AGAINST ANYONE.

01:07:50.232 --> 01:07:52.435
FOR THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN.

01:07:52.501 --> 01:07:54.036
FOR NATIONAL ORIGIN. AGAINST

01:07:54.103 --> 01:07:56.071
ANYTHING. THEY STOOD IN THE

01:07:56.138 --> 01:07:57.173
VOTED IN THE SAID WE WILL STAND

01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:58.707
AS CALIFORNIANS THIS DIVERSE

01:07:58.774 --> 01:08:00.543
STATE WE WILL NOT DISCRIMINATE

01:08:00.609 --> 01:08:01.710
AGAINST PEOPLE FOR THESE

01:08:01.777 --> 01:08:03.245
REASONS. THAT'S WHAT AB TWO

01:08:03.312 --> 01:08:05.581
OURS PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE

01:08:05.648 --> 01:08:10.052
SAYS. AN S. C. FIVE REPEALS TWO

OH NINE. IT SETS FORTH BEFORE

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:11.954
THE VOTERS TO REPEAL THAT

01:08:12.021 --> 01:08:15.324
STATUTE. IN OUR CONSTITUTION

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:17.059
AND SO RESPECTFULLY I DO

01:08:17.126 --> 01:08:17.960
BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE AN ISSUE

01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:19.528
THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BUT

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.931
AC FIVE IS NOT THE ANSWER AC

01:08:21.997 --> 01:08:23.966
FIVE IS A CALL TO WHAT'S GOING

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:25.167
ON IN OUR COMMUNITIES NOW. BUT

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:26.969
TO CREATE DISCRIMINATION POLICY

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:28.704
BY REMOVING THE ABILITY FOR THE

01:08:28.771 --> 01:08:30.372

ON THEIR ABILITY NOT BASED ON

01:09:19.121 --> 01:09:20.322
THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN AND

01:09:20.389 --> 01:09:22.791

HORRIBLE MAJOR. HERBAL BECAUSE

REALITY TO THIS DAY. AND IT IS

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:54.256
IMPORTANT THAT WE FIGHT BACK

01:09:54.323 --> 01:09:55.691

ON THIS. IN FAVOR BECAUSE OF

01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:05.534
WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. I

01:10:05.601 --> 01:10:06.502
WOULD CHALLENGE THAT I WOULD

01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:08.037
SAY WE'RE VOTING ON THIS RIGHT

01:10:08.103 --> 01:10:10.172

SO THAT THE PUBLIC HAS THE

01:10:30.793 --> 01:10:32.995
OPPORTUNITY TO FINALLY STOP THE

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:35.564
ILL EFFECTS OF PROP TWO OH NINE

01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:43.439
THANK YOU. SENATOR BARGES.

01:10:43.505 --> 01:10:47.843
THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I'LL

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:49.445
NEVER FORGET A STORY THAT MY

01:10:49.511 --> 01:10:51.413
FATHER TOLD ME WHEN HE WAS

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:55.551
YOUNGER. THAT HE WAS EMPLOYED

01:10:55.618 --> 01:10:58.153
AT AN ESTABLISHMENT IN A

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:00.289
SUPERIOR CAME TO HIM. AND

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:03.692
QUICKLY USHERED HIM INTO A-

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:07.763
LOCKER AREA. AND WHEN MY FATHER

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:10.666
ASKED WHY HE SAID BECAUSE THE

01:11:10.733 --> 01:11:12.768
OWNERS COMING BY. AND HE

01:11:12.835 --> 01:11:14.403
DOESN'T LIKE IMMIGRANTS IN HELL

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:16.372
FIRE YOU IF HE SEES THAT YOU'RE

01:11:16.438 --> 01:11:20.309
A GREEK IMMIGRANT. I HAD THE

01:11:20.376 --> 01:11:22.244
HONOR OF REPRESENTING FRESNO

01:11:22.311 --> 01:11:24.847
COUNTY AS WELL AS TEN OTHERS IN

01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:27.082
MY VERY LARGE DISTRICT. BUT I

01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:29.918
REMEMBER LEARNING THAT IN

01:11:29.985 --> 01:11:32.755
FRESNO THERE WERE ANTI ARMENIAN

01:11:32.821 --> 01:11:36.225
COVENANTS. WRITTEN INTO THE

01:11:36.291 --> 01:11:40.195
LAND USE POLICIES AND RULES OF

01:11:40.262 --> 01:11:42.297
OUR AREA AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:43.599
IN OTHER WORDS ARMENIANS COULD

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:45.134
NOT BUY PROPERTY IN CERTAIN

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.935
AREAS THEY WERE DISALLOWED IN

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:48.937
OTHERS. I THINK IF YOU IN

01:11:49.004 --> 01:11:50.172
PRETORIA WHO WATER FOR OUR

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:51.774
FRIEND FROM- KERR DEAN IS OUR

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.208
CENTER FROM CORDY IS HAD

01:11:53.275 --> 01:11:57.046
IDENTIFIED. RACE IS.

01:11:57.112 --> 01:11:59.915
PROBLEMATIC IN PUBLIC POLICY

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:01.917
AND HOW WE CONDUCT OURSELVES AS

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:03.652
A STATE IF HISTORY IS ANY

01:12:03.719 --> 01:12:06.655
INDICATION. WHERE THE IRISH OR

01:12:06.722 --> 01:12:09.058
YOU'RE JEWISH- GREEK ARMENIAN

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:11.360
OR YOU'RE CHINESE WE ARE

01:12:11.427 --> 01:12:13.462
REPLETE WITH EXAMPLES IN

01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:16.699
AMERICA OF DISCRIMINATORY

01:12:16.765 --> 01:12:20.035
PRACTICES AND POLICIES. NOW MY

01:12:20.102 --> 01:12:22.538
FRIEND FROM- A CENTER FROM LOS

01:12:22.604 --> 01:12:25.674
ANGELES BROUGHT UP- THE REGIONS

01:12:25.741 --> 01:12:27.643
OF CALIFORNIA V. BAKI I

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:30.612
REMEMBER STUDYING THAT IN LAW

01:12:30.679 --> 01:12:32.414
SCHOOL WAS VERY INTERESTING

01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:36.385
PIVOTAL CASE- THE STATE'S BACK

01:12:36.452 --> 01:12:37.019
TO NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WHERE

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:40.422
THE SUPREME COURT REJECTED. THE

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:45.661
USE OF STRICT RACIAL QUOTAS. AT

01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:47.362
WITH THAT HAT WAS INTERESTING

01:12:47.429 --> 01:12:49.631
STRICT RACIAL QUOTAS. AND THEN

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:51.767
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WITH PROP WO

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:55.337
OH NINE TUNE NINE REJECTED IT

01:12:55.404 --> 01:12:57.940
THE POLICY OF OUR GREAT

01:12:58.006 --> 01:13:00.642
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. NOW WE'VE

01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:03.245
HEARD COMMENTARY TODAY THAT IT

01:13:03.312 --> 01:13:05.114
SHE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THAT.

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:07.516
THAT IS BECOME ENCUMBRANCE AND

01:13:07.583 --> 01:13:09.017
THE DIFFICULTY TO FOLKS

01:13:09.084 --> 01:13:11.520
SEEKING- EMPLOYMENT IN

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:15.524
ADMISSION INTO HIGHER EDUCATION.

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:16.992
BUT SINCE THAT TIME

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:19.328
UNIVERSITIES AND JOBS

01:13:19.394 --> 01:13:22.664
OPPORTUNITIES HAVE BEEN ALLOWED

01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:26.735
TO USE RACE AS ONE OF MANY

01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:29.004
CONSIDERATIONS IN HIRING OR

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:31.707
ADMISSIONS. SO THIS IDEA THAT

01:13:31.774 --> 01:13:32.841
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION DOESN'T

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:35.577
EXIST IS STOP ACTUALLY ACCURATE

01:13:35.644 --> 01:13:36.645
WE HAVE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

01:13:36.712 --> 01:13:38.947
POLICIES IN BOTH THE PUBLIC AND

01:13:39.014 --> 01:13:41.383
PRIVATE SPHERES ACROSS OUR

01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:43.652
STATE ACROSS OUR NATION. IT

01:13:43.719 --> 01:13:46.522
EXISTS HE GIVES CONSIDERATION

01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:49.091
TO ECONOMIC BACKGROUND RACE

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:51.527
BACKGROUND SEX. IN A NUMBER OF

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:53.162
OTHERS SO WE ALREADY HAVE

01:13:53.228 --> 01:13:54.897
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION POLICIES

01:13:54.963 --> 01:13:56.965
DESPITE THE FACT THAT TWO OH

01:13:57.032 --> 01:13:59.001
NINE SAYS THAT WE SHOULDN'T. SO

01:13:59.067 --> 01:14:01.436
WE HAVE A CONTRADICTION HERE

01:14:01.503 --> 01:14:03.205
THAT IS IT IS IT IS TROUBLING

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:05.440
ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE

01:14:05.507 --> 01:14:06.742
HEIGHTENED TENSIONS THAT WE'VE

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:08.243
EXPERIENCE OF THE LAST COUPLE

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:12.881
OF MONTHS. BUT MY CONCERN IS

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:19.521
THAT. ACA FIVE. IS A PRELUDE.

01:14:19.588 --> 01:14:23.659
TO INSTITUTIONALIZING QUOTAS.

01:14:23.725 --> 01:14:27.296
AND THAT TO ME IS A CONCERN.

01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:28.063
AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE A

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:29.398
CONCERN FOR EVERYONE BECAUSE

01:14:29.464 --> 01:14:31.466
THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT WE DID

01:14:31.533 --> 01:14:34.970
NOT WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN. AND IN

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:36.839
OTHER WORDS IT WOULD BE THE END

01:14:36.905 --> 01:14:39.007
OF THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE

01:14:39.074 --> 01:14:40.242
PROTECTIONS IN THE U. S.

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:43.445
CONSTITUTION. SO USING

01:14:43.512 --> 01:14:45.314
DISCRIMINATION TO COMBAT

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:47.216
DISCRIMINATION IS NOT JUST AN

01:14:47.282 --> 01:14:49.952
OXYMORON AND PRINCIPLE. IT'S

01:14:50.018 --> 01:14:54.389
BAD POLICY. I WOULD ARGUE THAT

01:14:54.456 --> 01:14:56.592
WE CANNOT SIMULTANEOUSLY BE

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:59.962
DISCRIMINATORY. IN EFFORT TO

01:15:00.028 --> 01:15:07.035
ADDRESS DISCRIMINATION. AND I

01:15:07.102 --> 01:15:08.770
THINK THAT TO SUPPORT THIS

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:11.039
WOULD BE TO REJECT THE EQUAL

01:15:11.106 --> 01:15:13.242
PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE UNITED

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:16.245
STATES CONSTITUTION. IN SUPPORT

01:15:16.311 --> 01:15:19.548
OF EQUAL PROTECTION. WE ARE

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:23.385
LITERALLY GETTING. DROWNED OUT

01:15:23.452 --> 01:15:26.355
BY THE TENSIONS THAT EXIST IN

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:27.956
REAL TERMS AND THEY ARE VERY

01:15:28.023 --> 01:15:29.825
REAL DISCRIMINATION RACIAL

01:15:29.892 --> 01:15:32.561
PROFILING. DISADVANTAGED

01:15:32.628 --> 01:15:35.664
COMMUNITIES IN UPWARD- MOBILITY

01:15:35.731 --> 01:15:37.432
THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS PROBLEMS

01:15:37.499 --> 01:15:40.969
THAT WE HAVE. BUT THE IDEA OF

01:15:41.036 --> 01:15:44.339
ON DOING AN ANTI DISCRIMINATION

01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:47.175
POLICY IN OUR CONSTITUTION IN

01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:49.578
FAVOR OF DISCRIMINATION JUST

01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:51.546
DOESN'T DOESN'T PASS THE SMELL

01:15:51.613 --> 01:15:55.717
TEST. SO I KNOW THAT A LOT OF

01:15:55.784 --> 01:15:57.686
FOLKS ARE GOING TO HAVE YOU

01:15:57.753 --> 01:15:59.721
KNOW STRONG OPINIONS ON THIS.

01:15:59.788 --> 01:16:02.758
BUT I THINK. ALLOWING US TO USE

01:16:02.824 --> 01:16:04.226

BY USING QUOTAS IS NOT GOING TO

01:16:35.457 --> 01:16:35.891
DEAL WITH THE UNDERLYING

01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:01.516
THE BEGINNING OF OUR SESSION.

01:17:01.583 --> 01:17:03.852
WHEN THE GOOD CALLING FOR

01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:06.088
MONTEBELLO. TALKED ABOUT THE

01:17:06.154 --> 01:17:09.591
DALAI LAMA. AND THE NOTION

01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:11.860
THERE WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS

01:17:11.927 --> 01:17:15.163
PRACTICE HUMAN KINDNESS NO I

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:17.399
DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT THAT

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:19.334
SIMPLE NOTION ACTUALLY BROUGHT

01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:22.437
TEARS TO MY EYES. BECAUSE IF WE

01:17:22.504 --> 01:17:23.705
ACTUALLY PRACTICED HUMAN

01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:26.708
KINDNESS WE WOULD HAVE NO NEED

01:17:26.775 --> 01:17:30.078
FOR WAR. WE WOULD HAVE NO NEED

01:17:30.145 --> 01:17:33.582
TO DEVELOP A MILITARY THAT CAN

01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:36.585
DESTROY EVERY HUMAN BEING ON

01:17:36.651 --> 01:17:38.353
THE PLANET TWENTY TIMES OVER.

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:45.027
WE WOULD HAVE NO NEED. FOR

01:17:45.093 --> 01:17:47.195
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. WE WOULD

01:17:47.262 --> 01:17:52.768
HAVE NO NEED. AND WE WOULD NOT

01:17:52.834 --> 01:17:55.871
SEE LYNCHINGS OR HOLOCAUST OR

01:17:55.937 --> 01:17:57.973
DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE IF WE

01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:58.640
ACTUALLY PRACTICED HUMAN

01:17:58.707 --> 01:18:01.209
KINDNESS WE WOULD TREAT EACH

01:18:01.276 --> 01:18:04.613
OTHER EQUALLY. BUT THAT ISN'T

01:18:04.679 --> 01:18:06.915
THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE. AND

01:18:06.982 --> 01:18:09.851
FRANKLY IT NEVER HAS BEEN. SO

01:18:09.918 --> 01:18:13.455
PART OF OUR JOB IS TO RECOGNIZE

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:15.424
THE ASPIRATION AND TO KEEP

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:20.028
REACHING. FOR A BETTER HUMANITY.

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:21.730
BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN'T

01:18:21.797 --> 01:18:23.031
IGNORE THE HUMANITY IN WHICH WE

01:18:23.098 --> 01:18:26.368
LIVE AND YES IF WE HAD ZERO TO

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:28.170
FIVE EDUCATION AND YASSER FOR

01:18:28.236 --> 01:18:29.771
EVERY CHILD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:18:29.838 --> 01:18:31.673
LIVE OUTSIDE OF POVERTY AND NOT

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:34.309
LIVE IN FEAR OF GUN VIOLENCE IN

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:36.278
THEIR HOMES OR ON THEIR STREETS

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:38.747
YES THIS WOULD BE A MUCH

01:18:38.814 --> 01:18:40.682
DIFFERENT WORLD. BUT THAT IS

01:18:40.749 --> 01:18:43.418
NOT THE WORLD YOU LIVE IN. AND

01:18:43.485 --> 01:18:45.253
TOOK TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.823
PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE PASSED

01:18:47.889 --> 01:18:50.459
IT OPERATED UPON A-

01:18:50.525 --> 01:18:53.662
FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED NOTION

01:18:53.728 --> 01:18:56.131
THAT WE LIVE IN A COLOR BLIND

01:18:56.198 --> 01:18:58.333
AND GENDER BLIND SOCIETY. AND

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.902
THAT WE DON'T NEED TO RECOGNIZE

01:19:00.969 --> 01:19:03.171
ORWE DON'T HAVE ANY LEVELS OF

01:19:03.238 --> 01:19:05.674
DISCRIMINATION. AND THEREFORE

01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:08.343
WE SHOULDN'T. GIVE ANYONE A

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:10.779
MORE OF AN OPPORTUNITY THAN

01:19:10.846 --> 01:19:15.283
ANYONE ELSE. BUT THERE NEVER

01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:18.520
WAS REALITY. REALITY WHICH HAS

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:21.056
DEMONSTRATED SHOP OVER THE LAST

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:22.691
TWENTY FIVE YEARS IS EXACTLY

01:19:22.757 --> 01:19:24.426
VERY FEW WOMEN ON CORPORATE

01:19:24.493 --> 01:19:26.294
BOARDS VERY FEW PEOPLE OF COLOR

01:19:26.361 --> 01:19:27.496
AND CORPORATE BOARDS BUT

01:19:27.562 --> 01:19:29.397
TEENAGE MAKING FORTY FOUR CENTS

01:19:29.464 --> 01:19:30.899
TO EVERY DOLLAR A WHITE MAN

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:33.001
MAKES. WE HAVE SO MANY

01:19:33.068 --> 01:19:35.437
INSTANCES. WHERE THERE IS

01:19:35.504 --> 01:19:37.305
DISCRIMINATION WHETHER YOU'RE

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:38.773
WALKING PRECINCTS AND SOMEONE

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:40.242
SAYS I'D NEVER VOTE FOR AN

ORIENTAL. WHAT DID THE GOOD

01:19:44.146 --> 01:19:46.448
SENATOR FROM THAT AREA EVER DO

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:48.917
TO HAVE SOMEONE SAY. I HATE

CHIU BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE OR

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:53.588
I WOULD NEVER CONSIDER TAKING I

01:19:53.655 --> 01:19:55.290
WOULD NEVER TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY

01:19:55.357 --> 01:19:57.192
BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE WE ALL

01:19:57.259 --> 01:19:58.360
HAVE STORIES SIDE MENTIONED

01:19:58.426 --> 01:20:00.829
SEVERAL TIMES ON THIS FLOOR.

01:20:00.896 --> 01:20:02.130
GROWING UP IN IT IN A JEWISH

01:20:02.197 --> 01:20:05.100
HOME AS A JEWISH PERSON THE

01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:07.068
DISCRIMINATION THAT I FIXED

01:20:07.135 --> 01:20:10.572
THAT WE SEE TODAY WHAT WE ARE

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:13.241
TOLD IN. WELL NOT REPLACE US.

01:20:13.308 --> 01:20:15.877
AS A WOMAN YOU KNOW MY GOOD

01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:17.379
COLLEAGUE FROM GUARDINO TALKED

01:20:17.445 --> 01:20:19.648
ABOUT WALKING INTO A ROOM AND

01:20:19.714 --> 01:20:20.649
NOT SEEING ANYBODY WHO LOOKS

01:20:20.715 --> 01:20:23.118
LIKE YOU I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW

01:20:23.185 --> 01:20:25.554
MANY TIMES AS A YOUNG ATTORNEY

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:30.625
BACK IN THE DAY BEFORE WE. HAD

01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:31.193
TOO MANY ATTORNEYS FOR GOING

01:20:31.259 --> 01:20:31.826
INTO A CO ROOM AND BEING ONLY

01:20:31.893 --> 01:20:33.628
IN THE ANTI COURTROOM. IT'S A

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:35.297
STRANGE FEELING BECAUSE YOU

01:20:35.363 --> 01:20:36.631
DON'T THINK OF YOURSELF THAT

01:20:36.698 --> 01:20:38.767
WAY UNTIL YOU WALK INTO THAT

01:20:38.833 --> 01:20:39.768
ROOM AND REALIZE YOU'RE THE

01:20:39.834 --> 01:20:42.304
ONLY ONE WHO LOOKS LIKE YOU. SO

01:20:42.370 --> 01:20:46.174
THAT'S THE REALITY. HUMAN

01:20:46.241 --> 01:20:46.841
KINDNESS IS ASPIRIN. IT'S

01:20:46.908 --> 01:20:48.310
SOMETHING WE NEED TO STRIVE

01:20:48.376 --> 01:20:50.912
FOR. BUT UNTIL WE STOP THE

01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:52.347
LYNCHINGS AND STILL WE TALKED

01:20:52.414 --> 01:20:54.249
TO STOP THE HATRED AND STILL WE

01:20:54.316 --> 01:20:56.151
SHOULD STOP THE NOTION OF MY

01:20:56.218 --> 01:20:57.452
NATION'S BIGGER THAN YOUR

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:58.920
NATION A WILL READ A CAKE YOU

01:20:58.987 --> 01:21:00.455
FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

01:21:00.522 --> 01:21:03.592
UNTIL WE STOP BEHAVING THAT WAY.

01:21:03.658 --> 01:21:04.426
WE HAVE GOT TO LOOK AT

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:06.561
OURSELVES IN THE MIRROR AND SAY

01:21:06.628 --> 01:21:09.698
HOW CAN WE DO THIS BETTER. AND

01:21:09.764 --> 01:21:14.803
SO OPPOSITION TO NINE OPERATED

01:21:14.869 --> 01:21:18.340
UNDER A FALSE SENSE OF REALITY.

01:21:18.406 --> 01:21:22.143
WHAT THIS EFFORT DOES TODAY IT

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:23.378
SHOULD SIMPLY SAYS TO THE

01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:25.614
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA GIVEN WHAT

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:27.916

01:21:27.983 --> 01:21:30.418
FIVE YEARS DO WE WANT TO REALLY

THINK. THIS NOTION THAT WE LIVE

01:21:33.488 --> 01:21:35.924
IN A COLOR BLIND AND GENDER

01:21:35.991 --> 01:21:38.760
BLIND WORLD. DO WE WANT TO

01:21:38.827 --> 01:21:41.029
RECOGNIZE AND TRIED TO HELP

01:21:41.096 --> 01:21:42.931
OTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN LESS

01:21:42.998 --> 01:21:45.066
FORTUNATE THAN WE- THAN MANY OF

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:47.168
US YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:49.337
GREAT UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA THE

01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:50.772
BARKING CASE WHICH MY GOOD

01:21:50.839 --> 01:21:52.774
COLLEAGUE MENTIONED. THAT WAS A

01:21:52.841 --> 01:21:54.075
CASE DEALING WITH THE

01:21:54.142 --> 01:21:55.243
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHICH

01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:57.879
WAS TRYING TO HELP INCENTIVIZE

01:21:57.946 --> 01:22:00.081
AND ALLOW MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR

01:22:00.148 --> 01:22:02.017
AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES GET

01:22:02.083 --> 01:22:03.652
THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO

01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:04.619
COLLEGE AND WHAT THE UNIVERSITY

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:07.789
WAS TOLD AND SUBSEQUENTLY TOLD.

01:22:07.856 --> 01:22:09.424
YOU CAN'T EVEN CONSIDER THAT.

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:11.626
YOU HAVE TO PRETEND LIKE

01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:14.129
EVERYBODY HAD THE SAME

01:22:14.195 --> 01:22:15.597
OPPORTUNITIES GROWING UP. AND

01:22:15.664 --> 01:22:17.966
WE REALIZE THAT ISN'T TRUE AND

01:22:18.033 --> 01:22:20.468
SO LET'S TAKE THE STEPS NOW TO

01:22:20.535 --> 01:22:22.237
GIVE PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:22:22.304 --> 01:22:24.706

01:23:20.695 --> 01:23:21.496
ASKED ME A QUESTION I FELT

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:25.500
COMPLIED TO REPLY BECAUSE SHE

01:23:25.567 --> 01:23:26.935
ASKED A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION.

01:23:27.001 --> 01:23:30.972
AND THERE IS A VERY. VERY

01:23:31.039 --> 01:23:32.307
IMPORTANT ANSWER I MEAN THIS

01:23:32.374 --> 01:23:35.210
IS- THE ESSENCE OF PROP TWO

01:23:35.276 --> 01:23:37.212
NINE. WAS IT MISLED

01:23:37.278 --> 01:23:41.049
CALIFORNIANS. REPRESENTED OF

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:43.017
LANGUAGES SAID WE SHALL KNOW

01:23:43.084 --> 01:23:45.553
THAT THE UNIVERSITY SHOULD NOT

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:46.087
DISCRIMINATE WHO WOULD NOT

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:49.057
SUPPORT THAT. AND I MENTION THE

01:23:49.124 --> 01:23:51.192
60% OF LATINOS SUPPORTED IT

01:23:51.259 --> 01:23:53.027
THINKING THAT IT WAS AN ANTI

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:55.063
DISCRIMINATION MEASURE. BUT

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:56.965
PRIOR TO THAT THE ARGUMENTS

01:23:57.031 --> 01:23:59.267
WERE MADE THAT THEY- A STUDENT

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:01.736
THAT HAD BETTER GRADES HAVE NOT

01:24:01.803 --> 01:24:04.139
BEEN ADMITTED. TO ONE OF OUR

01:24:04.205 --> 01:24:05.940
UNIVERSITIES BECAUSE A PERSON

01:24:06.007 --> 01:24:08.309
WITH LESS GRADES HAD AND THAT

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:10.412
THEY WERE DENIED A SPOT. AND

01:24:10.478 --> 01:24:11.146
THAT WAS THE ARGUMENT SO THEY

01:24:11.212 --> 01:24:14.115
MADE OF THE PERSON WHO WAS NOT

01:24:14.182 --> 01:24:18.853
ADMITTED BECAUSE OF. THERE UP

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:20.789
SUPPOSEDLY BECAUSE OF THE RACE.

01:24:20.855 --> 01:24:22.791
THAT THEY WERE THE PERSON

01:24:22.857 --> 01:24:25.193
DISCRIMINATING AGAINST. BUT MY

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:28.430
QUESTION RETURN IS IF THIS IS

01:24:28.496 --> 01:24:30.165
AN ANTI DISCRIMINATION MEASURE

01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:33.201
WHY SINCE THE PASSAGE OF TWO

01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:34.936
NINE DO WE HAVE LESS STUDENTS

01:24:35.003 --> 01:24:36.871
OF COLOR NUMBER UNIVERSITIES

01:24:36.938 --> 01:24:38.673
WHY HAS IT GONE DOWN IF IT'S

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:39.974
REALLY ABOUT NON DISCRIMINATION

01:24:40.041 --> 01:24:41.309
WE SHOULD HAVE THAT NUMBER

01:24:41.376 --> 01:24:42.877
SHOULD HAVE INCREASED. BUT IS

01:24:42.944 --> 01:24:45.780
GONE DOWN. AND OFTEN I FEEL

01:24:45.847 --> 01:24:47.415
WHEN I THINK OF PROP TWO NINE

01:24:47.482 --> 01:24:48.983
THAT. THE BEST WAY TO

01:24:49.050 --> 01:24:51.219
CHALLENGES AFTER NOW OF TWENTY

01:24:51.286 --> 01:24:52.954
FOUR YEARS OF DATA. THAT WE

01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:54.923
SHOULD CHALLENGE PROP TWO NINE

01:24:54.989 --> 01:24:56.558
THE COURTS. BECAUSE IT MOST

01:24:56.624 --> 01:24:58.660
CERTAINLY WILL LOSE BECAUSE AN

01:24:58.726 --> 01:24:59.894
ANTI DISCRIMINATION MEASURE HAS

01:24:59.961 --> 01:25:01.863
REALLY RESULT IN DISCRIMINATION

01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:04.365
AND I ALSO WANT TO EXPLAIN HOW

01:25:04.432 --> 01:25:05.600
THIS ACTUALLY WORKS OUT

01:25:05.667 --> 01:25:06.568
PRACTICALLY. AND I WANT TO GIVE

01:25:06.634 --> 01:25:10.305

01:25:10.371 --> 01:25:12.474

01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:21.182
FRIEND THAT ALSO WENT TO UCLA.

01:25:21.249 --> 01:25:23.351
HE WAS THE SON. OF A VERY

01:25:23.418 --> 01:25:24.586

AND GROWING UP HE HAD TUTORS HE

01:25:29.591 --> 01:25:30.825
DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK GROWING UP

01:25:30.892 --> 01:25:34.529
WE NEVER HAD A JOB. HE WAS OF A

01:25:34.596 --> 01:25:37.165
VERY EXCELLENT STUDENT. BUT HE

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:38.867

01:39:11.211 --> 01:39:11.745
TO PUT SOMEONE IN THAT TYPE OF

01:39:11.812 --> 01:39:17.418

01:39:17.484 --> 01:39:22.656
NUMBER OF. TALENTED STUDENTS

01:39:22.723 --> 01:39:24.992

THIS STATE WHO. CAN GET THESE

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:32.433
JOBS IN CAN GET AND CAN GET

01:39:32.499 --> 01:39:34.201
INTO THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY

01:39:34.268 --> 01:39:35.669
BELONG THERE THEY DESERVE IT

01:39:35.736 --> 01:39:36.904
AND THEY'VE EARNED IT GIVEN THE

01:39:36.970 --> 01:39:40.808
CHANCE TO DO THAT WITHOUT.

01:39:40.874 --> 01:39:44.278
PUTTING THEM IN A POSITION. TO

01:39:44.345 --> 01:39:47.181
SECOND GUESS THEMSELVES. I MEAN

01:39:47.247 --> 01:39:50.384

01:39:53.754 --> 01:39:56.557
ABOUT THE FACT THAT. YOU KNOW

01:39:56.623 --> 01:39:58.625
IT STARTS AT THE AT THE LOWER

01:39:58.692 --> 01:40:00.494
GRADE LEVEL OF SCHOOL AND HOW

01:40:00.561 --> 01:40:04.365

01:40:04.431 --> 01:40:05.566
TO BE AREN'T HIGH PERFORMING

01:40:05.632 --> 01:40:07.401
AND SO THEY'RE ALREADY BEHIND

01:40:07.468 --> 01:40:08.302
WHEN THEY GET TO START WELL WHY

01:40:08.369 --> 01:40:10.070

VERY BEST K. THROUGH TWELVE

01:40:15.843 --> 01:40:17.444

THE VERY BEGINNING OF THEIR

01:40:31.125 --> 01:40:33.127
LIVES TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE

01:40:33.193 --> 01:40:35.696
AN EQUAL SHOT. AND TIME AFTER

01:40:35.763 --> 01:40:39.867
TIME THIS BODY. REFUSES THAT.

01:40:39.933 --> 01:40:41.402
DO YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS

01:40:41.468 --> 01:40:43.570
YOU CAN'T SAY WE WANT THEM TO

GET STARTED. YOU CANNOT HAVE IT

01:40:54.014 --> 01:41:03.624

EARLY NINETIES. YOU'RE LOOKING

01:45:03.063 --> 01:45:04.765

AWARDED THAT AWARD. AND WE SET

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:16.877
THE TONE FOR CALTRANS. BECAUSE

01:45:16.943 --> 01:45:18.011
A LOT OF THE WORK WAS DONE BY

CALTRANS BEFORE THEY DON'T HAVE

01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:23.183
VERY MANY BIDDERS. AFTER WE

01:45:23.250 --> 01:45:24.851
STARTED DOING WHAT WE DID WE

01:45:24.918 --> 01:45:27.354
START HAVING MORE BIDDERS. WE

01:45:27.421 --> 01:45:28.889
STARTED LOOKING TO SEVER THEIR

01:45:28.955 --> 01:45:31.458
RULES AND FOUND OUT THAT. THEY

01:45:31.525 --> 01:45:35.328
INHIBITED BIDDERS. I DON'T

01:45:35.395 --> 01:45:42.869
BELIEVE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:45:42.936 --> 01:45:47.140
CHANGING. OUR VIEWS ABOUT

01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:50.811
DISCRIMINATION. BUT WHEN PEOPLE

01:45:50.877 --> 01:45:54.948
SAY THEY WANT TO BE COLOR BLIND.

01:45:55.015 --> 01:45:55.549
THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO

01:45:55.615 --> 01:45:59.286
BE BLIND. WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT

01:45:59.352 --> 01:46:00.687
FROM MY STANDPOINT ON THESE

01:46:00.754 --> 01:46:02.656
CONTRACTS IF YOU'RE BLINDED

01:46:02.723 --> 01:46:09.563
THERE'S- BELIEVE MAY. THIS IS

01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:10.163
NOT THE RIGHT THING THIS IS A

01:46:10.230 --> 01:46:12.799
REGRESSION. AFTER PROP TWO OH

01:46:12.866 --> 01:46:15.168
NINE. PROP TWO OH NINE

01:46:15.235 --> 01:46:15.736
DESTROYED WHAT I WAS TALKING

01:46:15.802 --> 01:46:20.040
ABOUT. PROP TWO OH NINE. PUSHED

01:46:20.107 --> 01:46:21.775
IT BACKWARDS INTO THE OLD DAYS

01:46:21.842 --> 01:46:26.012
BELIEVE ME WHEN. WE WERE

01:46:26.079 --> 01:46:30.450
ENGAGED IN WRITING SB ONE. AND

01:46:30.517 --> 01:46:33.386
WE PUT SOME REAL HEAVY.

01:46:33.453 --> 01:46:37.157
PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS OF

01:46:37.224 --> 01:46:37.758
INVOLVEMENT YOU KNOW WE COULD

01:46:37.824 --> 01:46:40.627
PUT. THE CARD OF PARTICIPATION

01:46:40.694 --> 01:46:43.296
RULES WE HAD BACK IN THE HEYDAY

01:46:43.363 --> 01:46:46.633
WHEN WE DID IN THE NINETIES.

01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:49.803
BUT THE CENTER FROM GUARDIAN I.

01:46:49.870 --> 01:46:51.972
CREATED A- SET A SET OF

01:46:52.038 --> 01:46:55.942
STATUTES. THAT REQUIRED MORE

01:46:56.009 --> 01:46:58.879
PARTICIPATION BUT I THINK IT'S

01:46:58.945 --> 01:47:00.781
SHAMEFUL DON'T SHOOT. THREE

01:47:00.847 --> 01:47:02.349
QUARTERS OF THE CONSTRUCTION

01:47:02.415 --> 01:47:03.950
INDUSTRY ON OUR TRANSPORTATION

01:47:04.017 --> 01:47:06.720
FACILITIES. OUR WOMEN AND

01:47:06.787 --> 01:47:08.555
MINORITIES MAILING MINORITIES

01:47:08.622 --> 01:47:12.125
NOT ENOUGH WOMEN. BUT LESS THAN

01:47:12.192 --> 01:47:15.662
10% OF THE CONTRACTORS ARE

01:47:15.729 --> 01:47:18.999
MINORITIES. I THINK IT'S

01:47:19.065 --> 01:47:20.801
SHAMEFUL EURO SO IN OTHER WORDS.

01:47:20.867 --> 01:47:23.937
THEY'RE DOING ALL THE WORK BUT

01:47:24.004 --> 01:47:24.538
THE CONTRACTORS ARE MAKING ALL

01:47:24.604 --> 01:47:28.642
THE PROFIT. SO THAT'S THE

01:47:28.708 --> 01:47:34.414
RESULT. PROPOSITION TWO OR NINE.

01:47:34.481 --> 01:47:37.951
TO ME THAT'S AN EVIL. THAT'S AN

01:47:38.018 --> 01:47:42.522
EVIL. WE NEED TO HAVE.

01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:44.591

01:49:10.377 --> 01:49:15.715
CLOSELY. SO FOR ME. I THINK

01:49:15.782 --> 01:49:19.386

01:50:39.065 --> 01:50:40.400
OLD WHITE GUY. AN OLD STRAIGHT

EPISODES THAT WERE EXPERIENCED

BY MANY OF THE FOLKS HERE FACT

01:50:49.976 --> 01:50:52.212
I GREW UP IN OF AREA AND

01:50:52.278 --> 01:50:54.848
MIDWEST THAT WAS LARGELY ALMOST

01:50:54.914 --> 01:50:57.650
EXCLUSIVELY WHITE. OF ALMOST

01:50:57.717 --> 01:50:59.185
EXCLUSIVELY CATHOLIC THE GREAT

01:50:59.252 --> 01:51:00.887
DIVERSITY IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS

01:51:00.954 --> 01:51:02.889
WAS BETWEEN ST MARTIN'S INSANE

01:51:02.956 --> 01:51:04.557
AL'S AND YOU COULDN'T TRUST

01:51:04.624 --> 01:51:06.359
THOSE PEOPLE SAY MARTIN THIS.

01:51:06.426 --> 01:51:08.228
MOTHER WOULD SAY. THAT WAS THE

01:51:08.294 --> 01:51:09.963
DIVERSITY THAT I GREW UP WITH

01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:11.765
IN FACT THE ISSUES OF RACE I

01:51:11.831 --> 01:51:13.833
NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT TELL

01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:15.001
YOU THE TRUTH UNTIL I WAS.

01:51:15.068 --> 01:51:19.072
OLDER IT WASN'T UNTIL I

01:51:19.139 --> 01:51:21.307
ACTUALLY WAS IN THE ARMY. IT

01:51:21.374 --> 01:51:23.043
WASN'T UNTIL I OBSERVE GOING

01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:25.712
THRU OFFICER BASIC TRAIN THEIR

01:51:25.779 --> 01:51:27.280
FORTY FOUR MEN IN OUR TRAINING

01:51:27.347 --> 01:51:29.649
PLATOON ALL GOING TO BE SECOND

01:51:29.716 --> 01:51:34.120
LIEUTENANTS. ALL WHITE. AND

01:51:34.187 --> 01:51:35.388
AFTER BECOMING A SECOND

01:51:35.455 --> 01:51:36.923
LIEUTENANT THEORETICALLY YOUR

01:51:36.990 --> 01:51:38.591
COMMANDING INTER AN INFANTRY

01:51:38.658 --> 01:51:43.129
PLATOON. OF FORTY FOUR SOLDIERS

01:51:43.196 --> 01:51:46.666
OF WHICH AT LEAST THE THIRD IF

01:51:46.733 --> 01:51:48.935
NOT A HALF A MINORITY. AND SO

01:51:49.002 --> 01:51:51.271
WHEN HE ENTERED THE ARMY. THERE

01:51:51.337 --> 01:51:52.672
WAS TREMENDOUS RACIAL STRIFE

01:51:52.739 --> 01:51:54.541
TREMENDOUS RACIAL STRIDES POSE

01:51:54.607 --> 01:51:56.409
VIETNAM THE ARMY WAS BROKEN

01:51:56.476 --> 01:51:59.012
THERE WERE INCIDENTS ALL OVER

01:51:59.079 --> 01:52:01.081
NO WONDER WE HADN'T ALMOST

01:52:01.147 --> 01:52:02.949
EXCLUSIVELY ALL WHITE OFFICER

01:52:03.016 --> 01:52:06.119
CORPS LEADING AN ARMY THAT WAS

01:52:06.186 --> 01:52:08.021
BETWEEN THE THIRD AND A HALF

01:52:08.088 --> 01:52:13.126
MINORITY. THINGS CHANGED THE

01:52:13.193 --> 01:52:16.062
MILITARY THE ARMY RECOGNIZE

01:52:16.129 --> 01:52:17.397
THAT THERE WERE ISSUES OF

01:52:17.464 --> 01:52:20.333
LEADERSHIP. AND REACHED OUT AND

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:21.534
TRIED TO CHANGE THE EQUATION IS

01:52:21.601 --> 01:52:23.670
IT PERFECT HASN'T WORKED

01:52:23.736 --> 01:52:26.072
COMPLETELY IT IS NOT. BUT WHAT

01:52:26.139 --> 01:52:27.207
THE MILITARY DID IS THEY

01:52:27.273 --> 01:52:28.875
REACHED OUT THEY RECOGNIZE THAT

01:52:28.942 --> 01:52:30.477
DIVERSITY AMONG THE OFFICER

01:52:30.543 --> 01:52:32.579
RANKS LEAD TO A STRONGER

01:52:32.645 --> 01:52:34.347
MILITARY TO A STRONGER NATIONAL

01:52:34.414 --> 01:52:36.883
DEFENSE. AND SO IF YOU OBSERVE

01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:39.219
TODAY IN WEST POINT LAST WEST

01:52:39.285 --> 01:52:40.687
POINT CLASS HAD THE LARGEST

01:52:40.753 --> 01:52:41.454
NUMBER OF AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:52:41.521 --> 01:52:43.423
WOMEN. IN THE HISTORY OF THE

01:52:43.490 --> 01:52:45.692
UNITED STATES GRADUATE THAT THE

01:52:45.758 --> 01:52:48.795
ENTERING CLASS NOW IS ABOUT 37%

01:52:48.862 --> 01:52:51.498
MINORITY WHICH MAKES SENSE. I

01:52:51.564 --> 01:52:53.466
OBSERVED OVER THE THIRTY YEARS

01:52:53.533 --> 01:52:54.667
I WAS IN AND OUT OF THE ARMY

01:52:54.734 --> 01:52:55.869
THAT THE ARMY CHANGED

01:52:55.935 --> 01:52:58.271
DRAMATICALLY. FROM AN ARMY THAT

01:52:58.338 --> 01:53:01.341
WAS BROKEN. THAT WAS. REPLETE

01:53:01.407 --> 01:53:04.077
WITH STRIFE. TO AN ARMY THAT

01:53:04.144 --> 01:53:07.380
WAS FAR MORE FUNCTIONAL IN FACT.

01:53:07.447 --> 01:53:09.516
PERHAPS THE GREATEST ARMY IN

01:53:09.582 --> 01:53:11.684
THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND

01:53:11.751 --> 01:53:13.486
PART OF IT IS BECAUSE FOLKS

01:53:13.553 --> 01:53:16.055
RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE STRONGER

01:53:16.122 --> 01:53:18.391
WHEN WE HAVE LEADERS. WHO ARE

01:53:18.458 --> 01:53:20.393
DIVERS WHO BRING DIFFERENT

01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:23.630
EXPERIENCES TO THE FOR WE'RE

01:53:23.696 --> 01:53:26.799
STRONGER WHEN WE HAVE LEADERS

01:53:26.866 --> 01:53:29.202
WHO LIED PEOPLE WHO CAN LOOK UP

01:53:29.269 --> 01:53:31.571
TO THEM AS ROLE MODELS AND SO I

01:53:31.638 --> 01:53:33.640
STILL STRONG SUPPORT THEY SEE A

01:53:33.706 --> 01:53:36.709
FIVE. FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS.

01:53:36.776 --> 01:53:38.611
BECAUSE IT'S FAIR BECAUSE IT'S

01:53:38.678 --> 01:53:41.314
JUST BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT AND

01:53:41.381 --> 01:53:43.216
BECAUSE IT LEADS TO A STRONGER

01:53:43.283 --> 01:53:47.587
ECONOMY AND A STRONGER NATIONAL

01:53:47.654 --> 01:53:50.890
DEFENSE ARJUNA VOTE. UNDER THE-

01:53:50.957 --> 01:53:52.225
THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I

01:53:52.292 --> 01:53:53.560
APOLOGIZE FOR ASKING TO SPEAK

01:53:53.626 --> 01:53:55.295
AGAIN BUT I WON'T APOLOGIZE FOR

01:53:55.361 --> 01:53:57.430
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY AGAIN I

01:53:57.497 --> 01:53:58.798
WILL SAY THAT THE THINGS I HERE

01:53:58.865 --> 01:53:59.933
ON THIS FLOOR SOMETIMES ARE

01:53:59.999 --> 01:54:01.935
JUST SHOCKING TO ME I FIND IT

01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:03.736
UNCONSCIONABLE AND INCREDIBLY

01:54:03.803 --> 01:54:05.138
DISINGENUOUS THAT THE SENATOR

01:54:05.205 --> 01:54:07.340
FROM LAKE ELSINORE WHO IS A

01:54:07.407 --> 01:54:09.309
WHITE WOMAN AS I AM A WHITE

01:54:09.375 --> 01:54:11.144
WOMAN WOULD SAY THAT WE LIVE IN

01:54:11.211 --> 01:54:13.213
THE LEAST RACIST STATE AND THE

01:54:13.279 --> 01:54:14.948
LEAST RACIST COUNTRY. FOR TWO

01:54:15.014 --> 01:54:16.516
REASONS ONE I DON'T AGREE WITH

01:54:16.583 --> 01:54:18.818
THAT BUT TO LEAST RACIST

01:54:18.885 --> 01:54:20.153
IMPLIES THAT RACISM STILL

01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:22.422
EXISTS WE ARE HERE TODAY TO TRY

01:54:22.488 --> 01:54:24.524
AND CHANGE THAT AND MAYBE FOR

01:54:24.591 --> 01:54:27.093
HER AS A WHITE WOMAN SHE HAS

01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:29.262
NEVER EXPERIENCED RACISM BUT SO

01:54:29.329 --> 01:54:31.030
MANY PEOPLE HAVE HUNDREDS OF

01:54:31.097 --> 01:54:32.699
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN OUR

01:54:32.765 --> 01:54:36.236
STATE IN OUR COUNTRY HAVE WE

01:54:36.302 --> 01:54:38.404
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO ONE

01:54:38.471 --> 01:54:42.041

FEEL LIKE I CAN ONLY IMAGINE

01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:55.802

SO I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE

01:58:15.788 --> 01:58:17.523
TO UNDERSTAND SURVIVAL AND HOW

01:58:17.590 --> 01:58:19.058
TO BE CAREFUL AND HOW TO

SOME OF THE RULES THAT WERE IN

01:58:26.499 --> 01:58:28.234
PLACE THAT ALLOWED ME TO GET

01:58:28.301 --> 01:58:31.204

01:58:38.044 --> 01:58:39.679

01:58:39.745 --> 01:58:42.715
OBVIOUSLY. OF THE TRACKS. BUT I

DIFFERENT PATH. AND WHO DIDN'T-

01:59:04.837 --> 01:59:07.473
SOMEHOW GET THE OPPORTUNITIES

01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:08.474
THAT I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO

01:59:08.541 --> 01:59:10.510
HAVE. SHE WHEN THE MILITARY

01:59:10.576 --> 01:59:13.446
SHE'S A PROUD VETERAN AS WAS

01:59:13.513 --> 01:59:16.115
HER HUSBAND NOW DECEASED. BUT

01:59:16.182 --> 01:59:17.450
HER EXPERIENCE IN THE WORLD IS

01:59:17.517 --> 01:59:20.086
VERY DIFFERENT BECAUSE PEOPLE

01:59:20.152 --> 01:59:23.256
PERCEIVE HER NOT TO BE A- WHITE

01:59:23.322 --> 01:59:25.324
WOMEN THE PRIVILEGE SHE STILL

01:59:25.391 --> 01:59:27.360
HAS A LOT OF THE ISSUES. FROM

01:59:27.426 --> 01:59:29.295
THE BLUE COLLAR WORKING CLASS

01:59:29.362 --> 01:59:31.497

FROM. AND WE TELL YOU SHE'S

01:59:34.066 --> 01:59:35.167
TREATED DIFFERENTLY. SHE'S

01:59:35.234 --> 01:59:37.703
TREATED DIFFERENTLY AND SHE

01:59:37.770 --> 01:59:39.372
ACTS DIFFERENTLY SHE WOULD

01:59:39.438 --> 01:59:41.407
NEVER THINK TO ASK FOR

01:59:41.474 --> 01:59:43.175
SOMETHING THAT SHE DESERVES.

01:59:43.242 --> 01:59:45.912
AND I FEEL THE DIFFERENCE

01:59:45.978 --> 01:59:47.880
BECAUSE PEOPLE TREAT ME LIKE

01:59:47.947 --> 01:59:49.749
THE WHITE WOMAN A PRIVILEGE I

01:59:49.815 --> 01:59:51.884

ONLY SHARE MY STORY BECAUSE I

01:59:57.523 --> 02:00:00.693
THINK THAT THE TENSIONS TODAY

02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:03.195
EXIST BECAUSE WE HAVE AN

02:00:03.262 --> 02:00:05.698
ADDRESS THE ISSUES. BE THE SAME

OPPORTUNITY YOU HEAR A LOT OF

02:00:14.106 --> 02:00:16.475
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY- AND AN

02:00:16.542 --> 02:00:18.544
EQUITY THROUGHOUT ALL OF THIS

02:00:18.611 --> 02:00:20.713
BECAUSE THAT DAY YOU KNOW BE

02:00:20.780 --> 02:00:23.449
POOR AND ECONOMICALLY.

02:00:23.516 --> 02:00:25.685
DISADVANTAGED CROSSES ALL LINES

ARE. YOU KNOW OUR OUR HAS SOME

02:00:28.854 --> 02:00:31.023
REALLY PRETTY BASIC COMMENTS

02:00:31.090 --> 02:00:33.559
BUT I WANTED TO JUST THROW THAT

02:00:33.626 --> 02:00:35.027
OUT THERE AND BY THE WAY. YOU

02:00:35.094 --> 02:00:37.063
KNOW DIVERSITY NOT JUST HAPPEN

02:00:37.129 --> 02:00:40.099
IT TAKES WORK HARD WORK.

02:00:40.166 --> 02:00:43.035
FOCUSED WORK. AND I KNOW THIS

02:00:43.102 --> 02:00:44.203
BECAUSE I THINK I'M A PRETTY

02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:46.138
GOOD PERSON I LIKE TO THINK

02:00:46.205 --> 02:00:48.874
THAT I. AM ACCEPTING IT OPEN

02:00:48.941 --> 02:00:50.676
BECAUSE OF MY EXPERIENCES THAT

02:00:50.743 --> 02:00:54.180
I. AND BETTER RIGHT. AND THEN I

02:00:54.246 --> 02:00:57.416
TOOK THE IMPLICIT BIAS SURVEY.

02:00:57.483 --> 02:00:58.918
AND BOY DID I LEARN A FEW

02:00:58.985 --> 02:01:00.820
THINGS ABOUT MYSELF I WAS SO

02:01:00.886 --> 02:01:03.389
DEPRESSED AND DISAPPOINTED BUT

02:01:03.456 --> 02:01:05.925
IT WAS A REMINDER TO ME. I HAVE

02:01:05.992 --> 02:01:09.061
WORK TO DO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW

02:01:09.128 --> 02:01:10.997
HARD IT IS TO COME UP WITH

02:01:11.063 --> 02:01:11.764
PARAMETERS AND GUIDELINES AND

02:01:11.831 --> 02:01:13.933
RULES AND- IN THE END TO FIGURE

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.369
OUT HOW WE PROMOTE AN EQUITABLE

02:01:16.435 --> 02:01:18.638
PLAYING FIELD. HOW DO WE DO

02:01:18.704 --> 02:01:20.873
THAT. WITHOUT OFFENDING EACH

02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:24.443
OTHER. YOU KNOW HOW DO WE DO

02:01:24.510 --> 02:01:26.879
THAT BECAUSE IN OUR ATTEMPTS TO

02:01:26.946 --> 02:01:29.181
BEHIND OR OR ONE ON ONE-

02:01:29.248 --> 02:01:31.884
PERSONAL WE STILL HAVE ISSUES

02:01:31.951 --> 02:01:33.953
AND PROBLEMS BECAUSE WE ALL

02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:34.420
COME FROM A DIFFERENT

02:01:34.487 --> 02:01:36.389
PERSPECTIVE WE ALL LOOK THROUGH

02:01:36.455 --> 02:01:39.025
A DIFFERENT LENS. IT JUST IS.

02:01:39.091 --> 02:01:40.292
AND SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE

02:01:40.359 --> 02:01:41.594
TO DEBATE THESE THINGS BY YOU

02:01:41.661 --> 02:01:45.031
KNOW. THE TENSIONS EXIST

02:01:45.097 --> 02:01:47.166
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO

02:01:47.233 --> 02:01:48.934
AND THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DO IT

02:01:49.001 --> 02:01:52.104
AS A DEMOCRACY. IS TO IS TO

02:01:52.171 --> 02:01:54.607
HAVE THE DISCUSSION AND FIGURE

02:01:54.674 --> 02:01:56.042

02:01:56.108 --> 02:01:59.078
I'LL GET TO MINE- BASIC POINTS

02:01:59.145 --> 02:02:00.579
WHICH CLEARLY YOU'RE NOT

02:02:00.646 --> 02:02:02.581
PASSIONATE BUT VERY RELEVANT I

02:02:02.648 --> 02:02:05.151
HOPE. IT'S BEEN MADE CLEAR OUR

02:02:05.217 --> 02:02:08.087
DISCUSSION THE ACA FIVE WILL

02:02:08.154 --> 02:02:10.322
GIVE VOTERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:02:10.389 --> 02:02:12.058
DECIDE IF CALIFORNIA SHOULD

02:02:12.124 --> 02:02:13.993
ALLOW RACE AND GENDER TO BE

02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:15.261

THE ONLY CONSIDERATION NOT THE

02:02:21.233 --> 02:02:24.170
DETERMINING CONSIDERATION JUST

OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES IT'S

02:02:39.351 --> 02:02:41.187
TIME TO ALLOW VOTERS TO ALLOW

02:02:41.253 --> 02:02:42.988
CALIFORNIANS TO RE EVALUATE THE

02:02:43.055 --> 02:02:45.491
POLICY THE SAME WAY THEY DID

02:02:45.558 --> 02:02:47.126

ANSWER MY LIFE SUCH DIFFERENT

02:05:11.971 --> 02:05:16.175
BANG. THAT WAS I REMEMBER BEING

IN THE ASSEMBLY WHICH STRUCK ME

02:05:18.177 --> 02:05:19.879
THE MOST TO THE DEGREE THAT I

02:05:19.945 --> 02:05:21.280
TURNED AROUND ONE DAY ON THE

02:05:21.347 --> 02:05:22.481

THINK PERHAPS WE DON'T HAVE

02:05:49.842 --> 02:05:51.644
ENOUGH OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE

02:05:51.710 --> 02:05:53.112
THESE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS-

02:05:53.178 --> 02:05:54.446
CLEARLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

02:05:54.513 --> 02:05:56.015
OPPORTUNITY HAVE CONVERSATIONS

02:05:56.081 --> 02:05:57.883
ABOUT RACE BECAUSE THAT'S- THE

02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:59.852
REAL CRUX OF THE PROBLEM WITH

02:05:59.919 --> 02:06:02.388
OUR COUNTRY. AN INABILITY TO

02:06:02.454 --> 02:06:04.456
USE ALL TO WITH KNOWLEDGE. THE

02:06:04.523 --> 02:06:06.225
HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY THAT IT

WAS BUILT ON THE BACKS OF FREE

02:06:08.427 --> 02:06:11.096
LABOR. AND THE REASON THE HARD

02:06:11.163 --> 02:06:13.098
TIME HAVING THAT CONVERSATION

02:06:13.165 --> 02:06:15.000
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID. THAT

02:06:15.067 --> 02:06:16.268
IN ORDER TO SHARE POWER

02:06:16.335 --> 02:06:17.870
RESOURCES YOU MIGHT HAVE TO

02:06:17.937 --> 02:06:22.608
GIVE SOMETHING UP. I GET THAT

02:06:22.675 --> 02:06:24.843
WHAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT. AND

02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:26.912
BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER REALLY BEEN

02:06:26.979 --> 02:06:29.682
ABLE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION

02:06:29.748 --> 02:06:32.084
IT FEATURES IN THE SOMETIMES

02:06:32.151 --> 02:06:34.653

EXPERIENCE HAS WORKED SINCE

02:06:55.407 --> 02:06:55.941
BEING A MEMBER THE CALIFORNIA

02:06:56.008 --> 02:06:57.810

02:07:08.721 --> 02:07:11.557
HAVE WORK TO DO. BECAUSE

CLEAR THAT HE WAS

02:08:31.336 --> 02:08:32.805
INTELLECTUALLY SUPERIOR THE

02:08:32.871 --> 02:08:34.673

STANDARDIZED VERBAL TEST IN HIS

02:14:24.256 --> 02:14:25.857
SUCH TESTS IN SIMILAR CRITERIA

02:14:25.924 --> 02:14:28.026

THAT WE HAVE PEARL. AND THIS IS

02:37:56.633 --> 02:37:58.168
FROM THOSE WHO DO THE MOST

REALLY HARD WITH ONE I'VE USE

02:40:17.474 --> 02:40:18.342
ONCE HERE BEFORE BUT IT'S DEEP

02:40:18.408 --> 02:40:22.245

ANOTHER ONE OF THESE KIND OF

02:40:22.913 --> 02:40:25.716
BILLS. JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. I

02:40:25.782 --> 02:40:28.919
HAD A DREAM. AND WOKE UP IN THE

02:40:28.986 --> 02:40:33.924
NIGHT. THERE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN.

02:40:33.991 --> 02:40:35.459
WHO'S CRYING OUT TO ME FROM THE

02:40:35.525 --> 02:40:38.261

02:40:52.209 --> 02:40:54.878
PERPETRATED THAT ON HER. NOW

02:40:54.945 --> 02:40:56.013
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THESE FOLKS

02:40:56.079 --> 02:40:59.049
EARLY RELEASE. AND WE'RE GONNA

02:40:59.116 --> 02:41:02.919

02:41:46.029 --> 02:41:48.065
THAT WE FOCUS ON THE CONTENT OF

02:41:48.131 --> 02:41:51.635

02:41:51.701 --> 02:41:55.172
TO DO WITH EARLY RELEASE. THIS

02:41:55.238 --> 02:41:58.575

INALIENABLE RIGHT. AND THIS

02:43:21.491 --> 02:43:23.059

BELABOR THIS POINT BECAUSE I

02:43:43.547 --> 02:43:46.183
THINK IT WAS WELL ARTICULATED

02:43:46.249 --> 02:43:46.950
BY MY COLLEAGUE. I'M CENTRAL

02:43:47.017 --> 02:43:50.020

PAROLE. I WON'T SPEND TOO MUCH

02:43:59.162 --> 02:44:00.897
TIME ON THAT BUT I THINK ONE

02:44:00.964 --> 02:44:02.465
THING THAT WE MAY BE OVER

02:44:02.532 --> 02:44:04.568
LOOKING HERE. IS THAT THE JAIL

02:44:04.634 --> 02:44:07.904
SYSTEM THROUGH REALIGNMENT

02:44:07.971 --> 02:44:09.306
THROUGH A NUMBER OF PIECES OF

02:44:09.372 --> 02:44:12.008
LEGISLATION. HAS DRAMATICALLY

02:44:12.075 --> 02:44:13.710
SCALE BACK THE TIME THE PEOPLE

02:44:13.777 --> 02:44:16.112
ARE SPENDING IN JAILS OR EVEN

02:44:16.179 --> 02:44:18.915
IN PRISONS- ARE FOR THAT MATTER.

02:44:18.982 --> 02:44:20.483

WEATHERBY BY LAW OR- BUDGET.

02:44:27.057 --> 02:44:28.592
THAT REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF TIME

02:44:28.658 --> 02:44:31.294
THAT PEOPLE ARE SERVING. FOR

02:44:31.361 --> 02:44:33.697
PURPOSES OF A SENTENCE. AND

02:44:33.763 --> 02:44:37.601

ON THE CONDITION OF PAROLE.

02:44:42.639 --> 02:44:45.275
THEY'RE SATISFYING REGIONAL.

02:44:45.342 --> 02:44:47.911
BOB OF THEIR SENTENCE THE

02:44:47.978 --> 02:44:49.713
DISALLOW THE VOTE TO OCCUR ONE

02:44:49.779 --> 02:44:52.282
