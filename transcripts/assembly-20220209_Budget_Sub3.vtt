01:24:34.836 --> 01:24:36.971
CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME EONS THEY

01:24:37.038 --> 01:24:38.606

BEEN ABLE TO FUND ELEVEN WELLS A

01:49:18.818 --> 01:49:22.289
YEAR- OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS-

01:49:22.355 --> 01:49:23.623
ELEVEN WELLS A YEAR WOULD MEAN

01:49:23.690 --> 01:49:24.758
IT'LL BE TWO HUNDRED YEARS

01:49:24.824 --> 01:49:27.193
BEFORE WE- GET CLOSE TO HAVE. TO

THAT I WANTED TO MAKE IT JUST

01:49:46.146 --> 01:49:48.348

IN A SENSE ALTHOUGH IT THE

02:06:25.044 --> 02:06:26.645
BEGINNING OF THE DOCUMENT WE

MEASURE FUND- I MAYBE THIS WAS A

02:07:13.826 --> 02:07:14.727
QUESTION THAT COULD HAVE BEEN

02:07:14.793 --> 02:07:16.128
BROUGHT UP AND THE PREVIOUS

02:07:16.195 --> 02:07:17.062
TOPIC BUT HAS THAT CAMPING

02:07:17.129 --> 02:07:19.898
GROWING- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

02:07:19.965 --> 02:07:20.799
THAT THIS ACCOUNT IS FUNDED BY

02:07:20.866 --> 02:07:23.736
FEES. COLLECTED FROM FROM OIL

02:07:23.802 --> 02:07:30.376

02:07:30.442 --> 02:07:32.177
ALL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SURE I

02:07:32.244 --> 02:07:36.815
CAN ASSIST I AM RIGHT NOW THE-

02:07:36.882 --> 02:07:38.484
THE FUND ITSELF IS BRINGING.

02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:39.685
PROJECTED TO BRING IN A HUNDRED

02:07:39.752 --> 02:07:41.253
AND TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS

02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:43.655
AND BUDGET YEAR- WITH

02:07:43.722 --> 02:07:45.591
EXPENDITURES ABOUT IN LINE WITH

02:07:45.657 --> 02:07:46.058
THAT. FOR DEPARTMENT

02:07:46.125 --> 02:07:48.394
CONSERVATION ITSELF IT'S ABOUT

02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:48.894
NINETY EIGHT MILLION AND

02:07:48.961 --> 02:07:50.796
EXPENDITURES. BUT THERE ARE A

02:07:50.863 --> 02:07:52.297
FEW OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT SPEND

02:07:52.364 --> 02:07:54.767
OUT OF THE FUND AS WELL. AND SO

02:07:54.833 --> 02:07:55.868
IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR

02:07:55.934 --> 02:07:57.703

02:07:57.770 --> 02:07:58.971
TWENTY FIVE MILLION AND

02:07:59.038 --> 02:08:00.172
EXPENDITURES. BUT THE DEPARTMENT

02:08:00.239 --> 02:08:02.007
HAS THE AUTHORITY TO SET FEEL

02:08:02.074 --> 02:08:03.776
LEVELS SUFFICIENT TO COVER

02:08:03.842 --> 02:08:06.111
EXPENDITURES EACH YEAR OKAY AND

02:08:06.178 --> 02:08:09.114
HAS THAT THE TREND BEEN AS A

02:08:09.181 --> 02:08:11.116
GROWN OVER THE- THAT'S A PAST

02:08:11.183 --> 02:08:13.952
FIVE YEARS- I DON'T HAVE THE

02:08:14.019 --> 02:08:15.054
FIVE YEAR IN FRONT OF ME I CAN

02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:17.589
SAY FOR THE THREE YEARS THREE

02:08:17.656 --> 02:08:19.191
YEARS TO GET HARMON HAS BEEN HAS

02:08:19.258 --> 02:08:20.559
BEEN SPENDING DOWN THEIR FUND

02:08:20.626 --> 02:08:23.729
BALANCE A LITTLE BIT- YOU KNOW

02:08:23.796 --> 02:08:24.596
TRYING TO MAINTAIN A PRUDENT

02:08:24.663 --> 02:08:28.200
RESERVE. BY THAT TIME. BUT YES

02:08:28.267 --> 02:08:29.868
IT IT LOOKS LIKE WITH ALL OF

02:08:29.935 --> 02:08:32.104
THESE PROPOSALS IF APPROVED. IT

02:08:32.171 --> 02:08:33.906
WOULD BE ABOUT A SEVEN AND A

02:08:33.972 --> 02:08:36.542
HALF CENT INCREASE PER BARREL ON

02:08:36.608 --> 02:08:39.311
THREE PAIRS. TO MAINTAIN THE

02:08:39.378 --> 02:08:42.181
FUND BALANCE SAID. SO MY YEAH AN

02:08:42.247 --> 02:08:44.316
INCREDIBLE I'M WRONG BUT- TEN

02:08:44.383 --> 02:08:47.086
MILLION DOLLARS WAS BORROWED- IN

02:08:47.152 --> 02:08:48.420
IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TRANSFERRED

02:08:48.487 --> 02:08:50.556
TO THE GENERAL FUND- AT THE

02:08:50.622 --> 02:08:51.423
BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC

02:08:51.490 --> 02:08:53.525
BECAUSE OF. THE CERTAINLY THE

02:08:53.592 --> 02:08:56.361
ANTICIPATED BUDGET IMPACT- IS

02:08:56.428 --> 02:09:01.967
THERE AN EFFORT TO REPAY OR PUT

02:09:02.034 --> 02:09:03.068
THAT TEN MILLION BACK INTO THE

02:09:03.135 --> 02:09:06.605
FUND. SEEING THAT IT'S NOT YOU

02:09:06.672 --> 02:09:08.874
THINK THAT THE FUND IS USED TO

02:09:08.941 --> 02:09:11.376
DEAL WITH- I TO WELLS AND WELL

02:09:11.443 --> 02:09:14.713
ABATEMENT. ABSOLUTELY I'M THAT

02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:16.081
THAT TEN MILLION DOLLAR LOAN WAS

02:09:16.148 --> 02:09:17.683
ACTUALLY FOR A DIFFERENT FUND

02:09:17.749 --> 02:09:18.784
THAT'S THE HAZARDOUS AND IDLE

02:09:18.851 --> 02:09:21.186
WELL ABATEMENT FUND OKAY. THAT'S

02:09:21.253 --> 02:09:23.589
RIGHT I AM. YEAH AND TEN MILLION

02:09:23.655 --> 02:09:26.758
DOLLARS. IT WAS BORROWED- IT IS

02:09:26.825 --> 02:09:28.694
SCHEDULED TO BE PAID BACK IN

02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:30.295
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. BUT WE

02:09:30.362 --> 02:09:31.330
CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE FUND

02:09:31.396 --> 02:09:32.798
BALANCE THERE AND IF IT'S NEEDED

02:09:32.865 --> 02:09:34.766
EARLIER WE CAN TRIGGER THAT LOAN

02:09:34.833 --> 02:09:39.371
REPAYMENT OKAY BUT AND I DO

02:09:39.438 --> 02:09:40.305
THINK RIGHT IT IS A HAD IT HAS

02:09:40.372 --> 02:09:42.107
JUST IDLE AND DESERVE DESERTED

02:09:42.174 --> 02:09:43.809
WELL PAYMENT BUT WHY TWENTY

02:09:43.876 --> 02:09:45.911
TWENTY FOUR- IF I IF I CAN ASK.

02:09:45.978 --> 02:09:48.013
SINCE IF THIS DOES IT THERE'S A

02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:50.949
SIGNIFICANT SURPLUS THIS YEAR.

02:09:51.016 --> 02:09:52.484
I'M YOU KNOW IT WHEN ALL OF

02:09:52.551 --> 02:09:55.888
THESE LOANS WERE TRIGGERED- WE

02:09:55.954 --> 02:09:57.756
VIEWED ALL OF THESE AS A YOU

02:09:57.823 --> 02:09:58.924
KNOW HOW SOON DID WE THINK THAT

02:09:58.991 --> 02:10:00.492
THE FUNDS WERE ACTUALLY GOING TO

02:10:00.559 --> 02:10:03.262
NEED THE REPAYMENT- I'M- SO FOR

02:10:03.328 --> 02:10:04.396
THIS PARTICULAR FUND IT HAD A

02:10:04.463 --> 02:10:06.131
SUFFICIENT. FUND BALANCE THAT IT

02:10:06.198 --> 02:10:08.200
COULD COVER ITS EXPENDITURES

02:10:08.267 --> 02:10:10.602
THREE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- WE ARE

02:10:10.669 --> 02:10:11.837
LOOKING AT THIS SINCE THERE ARE

02:10:11.904 --> 02:10:13.138
SO MANY FUNDS THAT HAD LOANED

02:10:13.205 --> 02:10:15.474
OUT TO THE GENERAL FUND. THAT WE

02:10:15.541 --> 02:10:16.775
YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT

02:10:16.842 --> 02:10:19.077
REPAYMENTS I AM. EACH YEAR AND

02:10:19.144 --> 02:10:20.345
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT WILL

02:10:20.412 --> 02:10:22.581
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS YEAR.

02:10:22.648 --> 02:10:25.450
OKAY DO THE DIRECTOR- THE

02:10:25.517 --> 02:10:28.320
DIRECTOR CAL JAM. I GUESS. IF I

02:10:28.387 --> 02:10:29.888
COULD TAKE A STEP BACK-

02:10:29.955 --> 02:10:32.324
CERTAINLY IT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED-

02:10:32.391 --> 02:10:34.593
THAT- THE FEES COLLECTED FROM

02:10:34.660 --> 02:10:36.828
FROM OIL AND GAS PRODUCER'S IS

02:10:36.895 --> 02:10:42.234
IT IS. THE PREDOMINANT- SOURCE.

02:10:42.301 --> 02:10:45.904
OF THE OIL GAS AND GEOTHERMAL MR

02:10:45.971 --> 02:10:47.139
FUND. I GUESS FROM YOUR

02:10:47.206 --> 02:10:49.474
PERSPECTIVE DO YOU WANT THERE TO

02:10:49.541 --> 02:10:50.776
BE AN OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IN

02:10:50.842 --> 02:10:57.382
CALIFORNIA. THE NUTCRACKER WITH

02:10:57.449 --> 02:11:00.452
THE- WELL AS IT MIGHT APPEAR IS

02:11:00.519 --> 02:11:02.554
THAT YOU WANT THE FEES AND TAXES

02:11:02.621 --> 02:11:05.057
FROM THE ENERGY INDUSTRY BUT YOU

02:11:05.123 --> 02:11:08.493
DON'T WANT THE PRODUCT. SO HOW

02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:10.796
DO YOU HOW DO YOU FIND IN YOUR

02:11:10.862 --> 02:11:13.699
DEPARTMENT. IF YOU DON'T WANT

02:11:13.765 --> 02:11:18.070
THE INDUSTRY HERE. YEP

02:11:18.136 --> 02:11:20.973
PERSONALLY- THAT'S NOT MY-

02:11:21.039 --> 02:11:24.009
PERSPECTIVE OPINION- YEAH THAT'S

02:11:24.076 --> 02:11:25.744
BEEN CLEAR THAT THERE IS AN

02:11:25.811 --> 02:11:27.212
ANNUAL ASSESSMENT ON PRODUCTION

02:11:27.279 --> 02:11:29.748
AND IN THOSE FUNDS GO TOWARDS

02:11:29.815 --> 02:11:32.451
OPERATIONS OF THE AGENCY. SO IF

02:11:32.517 --> 02:11:34.519
SOMETHING ASSIGNMENT IS THIS

02:11:34.586 --> 02:11:38.090
THERE WAS A FURTHER IF WHAT THE

02:11:38.156 --> 02:11:39.825
ADMINISTRATION'S GOAL IS TO.

02:11:39.891 --> 02:11:41.893
ELIMINATE THE OIL AND GAS

02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:47.132
INDUSTRY THERE IS NO CULTURE. I

02:11:47.199 --> 02:11:48.634
CAN'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THIS

02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:51.336
REGIONAL. WHICH BUT YOU ARE

02:11:51.403 --> 02:11:53.005
LIMITED I MEAN YOU ARE THE

02:11:53.071 --> 02:11:55.874
REGISTRATION. A POINT OF ORDER

02:11:55.941 --> 02:11:57.743
AND CHAIRMAN BLUE ACTIVE I WOULD

02:11:57.809 --> 02:11:59.378
JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE

02:11:59.444 --> 02:12:01.280
LEGISLATURE RECENTLY CHANGE THE

02:12:01.346 --> 02:12:02.781
MISSION OF CAL JIM AND LIKE WE

02:12:02.848 --> 02:12:04.883
WERE THE ORIGINAL MISSION OF CAL

02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:07.352
JIM USED TO BE TO ENCOURAGE THE-

02:12:07.419 --> 02:12:11.390
DEVELOPMENT OF- OF. OIL INDUSTRY

02:12:11.456 --> 02:12:13.659
TO GAS AND OIL INDUSTRY AND DOES

02:12:13.725 --> 02:12:16.361
SO AYE AYES I THINK IT'S A AND

02:12:16.428 --> 02:12:17.396
B. DOES THAT LEGISLATION WENT

02:12:17.462 --> 02:12:18.363
THROUGH AND WAS PASSED AND

02:12:18.430 --> 02:12:19.765
SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR I THINK

02:12:19.831 --> 02:12:22.934
THAT'S PROBABLY. SPEAKS TO WHAT

02:12:23.001 --> 02:12:27.339
IS THE INTENTION OF EVERYBODY

02:12:27.406 --> 02:12:28.140
FROM THE GOVERNOR ON DOWN TO THE

02:12:28.206 --> 02:12:31.143
SURFACE- AND I WANT TO AGAIN I

02:12:31.209 --> 02:12:32.744
WANT TO STIPULATE THAT I'M JUST

02:12:32.811 --> 02:12:34.146
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND AYE I

02:12:34.212 --> 02:12:37.449
I'LL I'LL- I WANT TO GET TO THE-

02:12:37.516 --> 02:12:38.116
TO THE CRUX OF MY QUESTION OVER

02:12:38.183 --> 02:12:42.220
THE POINT IS. THE BCPS THAT SAID

02:12:42.287 --> 02:12:43.155
TO THE CASTING DIRECTOR THE YOUR

02:12:43.221 --> 02:12:48.327
BCPS ARE FUNDED. THROUGH THE

02:12:48.393 --> 02:12:51.096
FEES. AND TAXES- AND- ON THE

02:12:51.163 --> 02:12:53.532
INDUSTRY AND IT WAS STATED BY

02:12:53.598 --> 02:12:56.368
THE PART OF FINANCE. THAT THERE

02:12:56.435 --> 02:12:58.337
ALSO DOING WHERE WE'RE WE'RE

02:12:58.403 --> 02:12:59.204
CHARGING FOR THE STATE OF

02:12:59.271 --> 02:13:01.206
CALIFORNIA IS CHARGING FEES ON

02:13:01.273 --> 02:13:03.208
EVERY BARREL OF OIL. THAT GOES

02:13:03.275 --> 02:13:04.976
INTO THE OIL GAS AND GEOTHERMAL

02:13:05.043 --> 02:13:07.379
MEASURE TO FUND. AND INTO THE

02:13:07.446 --> 02:13:10.182
HOUSES IDLE AND DOES VERY WELL

02:13:10.248 --> 02:13:11.550
ABATEMENT FUND. THE INDUSTRY IS

02:13:11.616 --> 02:13:14.219
PAYING INTO THOSE- INTO THOSE

02:13:14.286 --> 02:13:16.588
FUNDS THAT WE ARE ALLOCATING AS

02:13:16.655 --> 02:13:18.957
THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. SO MY

02:13:19.024 --> 02:13:20.759
POINT I GUESS TO THE TO THE TO

02:13:20.826 --> 02:13:22.394
THE TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA

02:13:22.461 --> 02:13:24.329
BARBARA INTO THIS COMMITTEE IS

02:13:24.396 --> 02:13:26.298
THAT THE WHOLE OUR WHOLE

02:13:26.365 --> 02:13:28.400
EXERCISE OF ALLOCATING THESE

02:13:28.467 --> 02:13:32.204
RESOURCES. TO TO A PLUG I TO

02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:34.940
WELLS TO FIND THESE PERMANENT

02:13:35.006 --> 02:13:39.478
POSITIONS. COME FROM SOMEWHERE.

02:13:39.544 --> 02:13:43.849
IT COMES FROM FEES AND TAXES

02:13:43.915 --> 02:13:46.651
PAID FOR BY THE INDUSTRY SO IT'S

ADMINISTRATION'S. MULTI BENEFIT

02:18:18.089 --> 02:18:20.025
NATURE BASED PROPOSALS THOUGH WE

02:18:20.091 --> 02:18:23.295
BELIEVE THE PROGRAM THE PROPOSAL

02:18:23.361 --> 02:18:23.895
IS LACKING IN QUITE A BIT OF

02:18:23.962 --> 02:18:26.898
DETAIL- AND IT'S NOT A ATTENTIVE

02:18:26.965 --> 02:18:28.733
ENOUGH TO I THINK THREE PILLARS

02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:30.201
THAT WE THINK OR BELIEVE OVER

02:18:30.268 --> 02:18:33.271
LINE WITH THE NATURE BASED-

02:18:33.338 --> 02:18:34.472
PROPOSALS. WE BELIEVE THE

02:18:34.539 --> 02:18:35.607
ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE

02:18:35.674 --> 02:18:36.941
FOCUSING ON ENVIRONMENTAL

02:18:37.008 --> 02:18:39.077
JUSTICE AS IT DOES BUT SHOULD

02:18:39.144 --> 02:18:41.446
ALSO BE REALLY MOVING IN TO

02:18:41.513 --> 02:18:42.814
TACKLE THIS CONCEPT OF

02:18:42.881 --> 02:18:44.983
RECREATIONAL JUSTICE. IS WELL AS

02:18:45.050 --> 02:18:46.718
ECONOMIC JUSTICE WHEN WE THINK

02:18:46.785 --> 02:18:48.286
ABOUT THE BROADER SPECTRUM OF

02:18:48.353 --> 02:18:49.421
ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'RE GETTING

02:18:49.487 --> 02:18:51.489
READY TO UNDERTAKE. UNDER THE

02:18:51.556 --> 02:18:53.291
THIRTY BY THIRTY WE'VE WE HAVE

02:18:53.358 --> 02:18:55.960
RESPONDED- THROUGH A NUMBER OF

02:18:56.027 --> 02:18:58.563
REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS. WHEN V.

02:18:58.630 --> 02:19:00.298
IT MINISTRATION TALKS ABOUT AN

02:19:00.365 --> 02:19:02.500
OUTDOORS FOR ALL OUR ACCESS FOR

02:19:02.567 --> 02:19:04.736
ALL. WE'VE BEEN A BIT CRITICAL-

02:19:04.803 --> 02:19:05.870
BUT IT'S WE'VE HAD SOME GOOD

02:19:05.937 --> 02:19:07.539
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE FACT THAT

02:19:07.605 --> 02:19:10.608
ACCESS AND PROXIMITY. SHOULD NOT

02:19:10.675 --> 02:19:12.944
NECESSARILY BE THE SAME THING-

02:19:13.011 --> 02:19:14.779
TO GIVE A VERY BRIEF EXAMPLE

02:19:14.846 --> 02:19:16.181
THERE ARE NUMEROUS CALIFORNIANS

02:19:16.247 --> 02:19:18.483
I WANT TO FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON

02:19:18.550 --> 02:19:21.820
PEOPLE OF COLOR. THAT ARM WOULD.

02:19:21.886 --> 02:19:25.323
SOONER GO THROUGH TSA. ARM BE

02:19:25.390 --> 02:19:26.891
SUBJECTED TO A PAT DOWN SEARCH

02:19:26.958 --> 02:19:28.860
AND FLY OFF SOMEWHERE ON AN

02:19:28.927 --> 02:19:32.163
AIRPLANE FOR FIVE HOURS. TO HAVE

02:19:32.230 --> 02:19:35.734
A CURATED SORT OF NATURE BASED.

02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:38.169
EXPERIENCE BEFORE THEY WOULD GO

02:19:38.236 --> 02:19:40.238
OUT TO A FREE. OUR STATE OR

02:19:40.305 --> 02:19:43.608
FEDERAL FORSTER OR OR PARK AND-

02:19:43.675 --> 02:19:45.844
AND I THINK THAT GOES ON A LONG

02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:48.279
ENOUGH TO SAY THAT. WHEN WE TALK

02:19:48.346 --> 02:19:49.848
ABOUT THE GOALS OF THIRTY BY

02:19:49.914 --> 02:19:51.583
THIRTY IN SOME OF THESE OTHER

02:19:51.649 --> 02:19:52.751

02:19:54.753 --> 02:19:56.654
THAT FOSTERING CONNECTIONS TO
