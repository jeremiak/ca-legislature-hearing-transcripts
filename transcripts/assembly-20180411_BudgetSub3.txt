TWENTY EIGHTEEN MEETING OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER THREE ON RESOURCES AND TRANSPORTATION IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL HERE THIS MORNING WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN. WITH OUR. OF FIRST DATA. ITEM TO BE HEARD AND WILL I GET TO THE VOTE ONLY COUNTER LOW BUT LATER IN THE AGENDA. OUR LOW BUT LATER IN THE MORNING. AND SO WE BEGINWITH OUR FIRST ISSUE OUR ANNUAL. A REVIEW OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. WELCOME MISTER KELLY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBER HAS HUH I THINK THREE PANELS THIS MORNING ANSWER TO. WE'LL BEGIN WITH YOURS. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M BRIAN KELLY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL FORTY. TO MY RIGHT IS RUSS FONG. WHO IS OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY? I'M ON MARCH NINTH THE AUTHORITY RELEASED IT'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN FOR PUBLIC REVIEW. AND COMMENT THE DRAFT TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. OF PRESENTS OUR VISION FOR IMPLEMENTING THE NATION'S FIRST HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM. I IN THE FACE OF CHALLENGES THAT PROJECTS AROUND THE WORLD OF SIMILAR MAGNITUDE. AND COMPLEXITY HAVE FACED AND ADDRESSED. BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS DRAFT PLAN THE AUTHORITY IS ASSIGNING COSTS. TO RISKS PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED IN PRIOR PLANTS AND REPORTS AND PRESENTS A BASELINE COST ESTIMATES. FOR ALL PROJECTS SECTIONS. ALSO FOR THE FIRST TIME THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN DRAFT PLAN. A WE JUST CONTINUE THE PAST PRACTICE OF ESTIMATING PROJECT COSTS WITH THE SPUR A DOLLAR ESTIMATE. AND INSTEAD THE PLAN ESTIMATES COSTS UTILIZING A BASELINE ESTIMATE AND RANGES. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY BEST INDUSTRY PRACTICES FOR MEGA PROJECTS. REVISED BASED MY COSTS AS MUCH OF AN INCREASE. IN COSTS LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION. INCREASED CONTINGENCY IN PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED CONSTRUCTION DELAYS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. HE'S AREAS MAKE UP ABOUT EIGHTY THREE PERCENT OF THE COST INCREASES. OF FOR THE FULL PHASE ONE SERVICE. YEAH FOR THE FULL PHASE ONE SERVICE BILL THAT BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES IN ANAHEIM. THE SCHEDULE FOR THE BAD ABOUT THE SERVICE. IN THE FOUR PAGE ONE SERVICE ARE ALSO PUSHED OUT BY FOUR YEARS IN THE PLAN RESPECTIVELY. AND THESE SCHEDULES BE AFFECTED PRIMARILY BY THE TIMING. AND AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING FOR FOR PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. DRAFT PLAN ALSO CONTINUES A FINANCING STRATEGY CONSISTENT WITH THE ONE OUTLINED IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. TO BETTER ALIGN THE TIMING OF CAP AND TRADE FUNDS AT THE PROJECT CAN BE DELIVERED. IN A MANNER THAT PROVIDES. BUT BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIANS AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME. THE IN THE FACE OF THESE CHALLENGES THE DRAFT PLAN PROPOSES TO CONTINUE AND INVESTMENT STRATEGY. THAT BUILDS INFRASTRUCTURE AND USABLE SEGMENTS THAT WILL BE LINKED OVER TIME TO PROVIDE MOBILITY. ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIANS. AND INITIATE HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. TOWARD THAT END THE DRUG BUSINESS PLAN IDENTIFIES THE FOLLOWING INVESTMENT PRIORITIES IN ORDER. THE FIRST HAS TO MEET OUR COMMITMENTS TO OUR FEDERAL FUNDING PARTNER. THAT MEANS THE AFFORDABLE COMPLETE. THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE SEGMENT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. INCOMPLETE THE ENVIRONMENT A REVIEW OF FOR THE ENTIRE PHASE ONE SYSTEM BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES IN ANAHEIM. BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO AS IS REQUIRED IN OUR FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENT. SECONDLY WE EXTEND THE BALLOT VALLEY SERVICE FROM SAN FRANCISCO ALL THE WAY TO BAKERSFIELD. THAT'S THIS DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN RECOGNIZES THE HIGHER RIDERSHIP AND REVENUE POTENTIAL BY LINKING THE SILICON VALLEY. THE CENTRAL VALLEY BETWEEN THESE TWO CITIES SAN FRANCISCO BAKERSFIELD. WE PROPOSE TO ELIVER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILES OF HIGH SPEED RAIL READY INFRASTRUCTURE FOR USE BY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. A PLAN PROPOSES TO CONSTRUCT HIGH SPEED RAIL READY INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BETWEEN BAKERSFIELD AND MADERA. IN THE SILICON VALLEY YEARLY SAN FRANCISCO. TO REDUCE TRAVEL TIMES FOR EXISTING PASSENGER RAIL SYSTEMS EXPAND CLEAN OF ELECTRIFIED SERVICE. AND PREPARE THE CORRIDORS FOR TESTING IT POTENTIAL EARLY HIGH SPEED RAIL OPERATIONS. FOURTH WE ISOLATE THE TUNNELING IN THE PROJECT WILL PASS AS THE FINAL MISSING LINK TO COME ABOUT ABOUT THE SERVICE. WE ARE ENGAGING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR EXPERTISE TO EXAMINE REFINER DESIGN OPTIONS FOR THAT TOTALING. OPTIMIZE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY LIMIT COSTS AND DEVELOP INNOVATED FUNDING OPTIONS TO COMPLETE THE TUMBLING THROUGH THE PROJECT A PASS. WE ALSO IN THIS PLAN CONTINUE THE BOOK IN INVESTMENTS OF FROM PROPOSITION ONE A IN BOTH SOUTHERN. AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THE DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN CONTINUES TO PRIORITIZE IMPROVING LOS ANGELES UNION STATION. THE BURBANK TO ANAHEIM CORRIDOR AND THE ELECTRIFICATION OF THE CALTRAIN CORRIDOR. IN THE BAY AREA. AS I NOTED THE PLAN REFLECTS THE AUTHORITIES COMMITMENT TO APPLY LESSONS LEARNED AND MAKE ORGANIZATION IMPROVEMENTS NECESSARY. TO DELIVER THIS PROJECT TO INITIATE HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE. OF BETWEEN SILICON IN CENTRAL VALLEY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WHILE COMPLETING ENVIRONMENTAL WORK IN MAKING IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CONSISTS OF THE ACTION TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE TO INVEST THOSE BOOK AND FUNDS. A WITH THE RELEASE OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN WE'VE INITIATED A SIXTY DAY. PERIOD A PUBLIC REVIEW AND COMMENT. THAT PERIOD CLOSES ON MAY SEVENTH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THE FINAL PLAN IS SCHEDULED TO BE ADOPTED BY THE AUTHORITY BOARD AT ITS PUBLIC HEARING. A DURING THE THIRD WEEK OF MAY SCHEDULED FOR SAN JOSE. AT THIS TIME. I'VE ALREADY INTRODUCED A HIGH RESPONDER CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER HE'LL HELP ME ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GIVING IT WORTH NOTING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS IS THAT. EARLIER THIS YEAR I THINK MAYBE THAT DAY EITHER THE DAY BEFORE THE DAY AFTER I. ACCEPT THIS POSITION OF THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED AN AUDIT OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL FORTY. I WANT TO ASSURE MEMBERS AT THE AUDITOR'S STARTED THAT WORK WE'VE MADE OFFICE SPACE AVAILABLE. THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE WORKING ON THE AUDIT. I BELIEVE IT WILL LIKELY SHOW. WHERE THE AUTHORITIES MADE IMPROVEMENTS AND IT'LL OBVIOUSLY SHOW WHERE WE MUST CONTINUE TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ORGANIZATION THE MANAGEMENT THE PROJECT? I DO WELCOME THIS EXTERNAL REVIEW. AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL HELP US TO IMPROVE. A PROGRAM OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT. THE AUDITOR'S REVIEW IS SCHEDULED TO CONCLUDE IN BE RELEASED SOMETIME IN AUGUST TO TWENTY. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS A STORY THAT WAS AUGUST OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHAT IS YOUR IN DEPTH. AND JUST A FEW MONTHS YES SIR. THERE I. FOUND BELIEVE THERE'S NOT. GOTTEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE STATE STAFF. A FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. OF IS THAT I I THINK WE'VE SEEN THAT TO A REQUEST YET TO. WHEN CAN WE ANTICIPATE THAT WELL WOULD. I'M NOT YOU'LL SEE THAT THIS YEAR CANDIDLY BECAUSE WE ARE ASSESSING NOW. THE OPERATIONS OF THE AFFORDABLE WHAT WE NEED AND. WE DO HAVE SOME VACANCIES THAT WE NEED TO FILL AND WE'RE WORKING TO DO THAT. IN REAL TIME. AND. WE HAVE SOME AGREEMENT TO BORROW SOME STAFF WITH REQUIRED OF AGREEMENT WITH CALTRANS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT AS WELL SO. THAT WHEN WE COME FOR THE NEW STAFF REQUESTED TO A PREMATURE FROM IT'S A RIGHT NOW I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE MORE EFFICIENT ANYWAY. QUESTIONS. PATTERSON. I. THE RAPPER. FIRST OF ALL ONE OF WELL. TO LET YOU KNOW HOW AT THAT THAT I DO APPRECIATE. THE CANDOR AND. THE EFFORT HERE OF THIS IS IN MY JUDGMENT A BUSINESS PLAN THAT. CERTAINLY TRY TO GET CLOSER TO. BUT A REAL BUSINESS PLAN IS ABOUT AND I AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT. OVER THE LAST THE IN SEVERAL WEEKS SAID THERE IN IN OTHER HEARINGS AND THINGS THERE HAS BEEN A REAL CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIFFICULTY THAT IS. THAT IS FACING US. UP SOMEONE EXPLORE JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THE INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT IT IT IT WILL GO FROM WHERE TO WHERE. OUR FIRST FULL SERVICE WOULD BE. UP BAKERSFIELD ST FRANCIS. UNDER THE VALID TO VALLEY SERVICE TO BE OUR FIRST FULL. LENGTH SYSTEM HOWEVER BUT WE DON'T HAVE FULL FUNDING FOR THAT RIGHT NOW. AND SO. WE ARE TAKING APPROACH THAT COMMON FOR OTHER TRANSIT A ENTITIES AROUND THE. COUNTRY IN STATE WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD IN A INCREMENTAL WAY AND SO THE FIRST IS AS YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE STRETCH. THAT WE HAVE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS AND AWAY FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WE GET OPERATIONS OUT OF THAT OUT OF THOSE ASSETS ONCE THEY'RE BUILT. SO. I AM WE ARE PROPOSING IN THE BUSINESS PLAN TO INCREMENTALLY GET TO THE VALLEY TO VALLEY SERVICE. AND IN THE MEANTIME WE WOULD BUILDING AWAY AS WE'VE. OUTLINED IN PRIOR PLANTS TO PROVIDE SOME MOBILITY BENEFIT. WITH THE SEGMENTS THAT WE BUILT SO THE FIRST OF CENTER VALLEY SIDE IS AT BAKERSFIELD MADERA STRETCH CONNECTING WITH THE AMTRAK SERVICE GOING NORTH. I TO SACRAMENTO IN WEST TO THE BAY AREA. AND ON THE SILICON VALLEY SIDE WE ARE ALREADY PARTNERS IN THE ELECTRIFICATION OF THE PROJECT FROM SAN JOSE TO SAN FRANCISCO. AND WE ARE PROPOSING TO EXTEND THAT FURTHER SOUTH TO GILROY SUITE OF ELECTRIFIED SECTION. ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILES AND TOTAL OF ELECTRIFIED. SERVICE ON TWO ENDS AND WE WE STILL PROPOSED TO GET THE. ISOLATE THE TUNNELS LAST PIECE TO COMPLETE THAT ABOUT. SO. WE HAVE A A ESSENTIALLY ADMIT INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT THAT IS DISCONNECTED AMENDED IT IT IT IT IT SO IT RUNS. IT BASICALLY RUNS FROM. OUTSIDE MADERA GAS TO. OUTSIDE BAKERSFIELD THAT THAT WILL BE IN OPERATION WHAT WILL RUN ON ON THOSE TRACKS YET WE ARE. WE HAVE NOW ENGAGE IN EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR THAT WE ARE A TALKING TO NOW ABOUT HOW BEST TO PUT THAT SERVICE IN PLACE BUT. THE PROPOSAL HERE'S TO GO ALL THE WAY TO BAKERSFIELD IN THE SOUTH AND. IN THE NORTH I THE MADERA OR MERCED. A LIKELY MADERA AND CONNECT THEIR WITH THE AMTRAK SYSTEM THAT GOES FURTHER SOUTH OF FURTHER NORTH TO SACRAMENTO. AND WEST TO THE. BAY AREA THAT IS AN INCREMENTAL A USE THAT WE ARE EXAMINING WE WE WANT TO LOOK AT WHETHER NOT WE CAN DO THAT WITH ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED TRAINS INITIALLY OR WHETHER WE HAVE TO. ALLOW THE ASSETS TO BE USED DIRECTLY BY AMTRAK AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE. ANALYZING IN REAL TIME AND I'D INDICATED A PRIOR HEARING WOULD BE REPORTING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. AT OUR PROJECT UPDATE REPORT IN MARCH. WHAT? THE LANGUAGE IN THE. PLAN. IN DESCRIBING. HIGH SPEED YET THAT IT INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT. HAS CHANGED IT THAT THE LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE IT USED TO BE HIGH SPEED RAIL. THIS BUSINESS PLAN DESCRIBED IT AS HIGH SPEED RAIL READY. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO WELL ULTIMATELY THE. WE WILL HAVE A A SYSTEM THAT IS ENTIRELY A HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM CONNECTING BAKERSFIELD AND SAN FRANCISCO. AS WE'VE INDICATED IN THE PLAN AND IN PRIOR HEARINGS OF WE DON'T HAVE THE FULL FUNDING FOR THAT AT THIS TIME SO SIMILAR TO WHAT DID THIS PROJECT IS NEVER HAD FULL FUNDING. OF FOR ALL OF ITS. OUR OPERATIONS AND SO WE ARE PROPOSING TO BUT BUILT IT INCREMENTAL STAGES THE FIRST IS MEET OUR FEDERAL COMMITMENT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO GET SOME OPERATIONAL USE OUT OF THE ASSETS WERE BUILDING THEIR. A LOT WE WANT TO EXAMINE AND I WON EXAMINE WHETHER HIGH SPEED ELECTRIFY TRAINS COULD BE INITIALLY USED THEIR TO CUT DOWN THE TRAVEL TIMES NOW. WHAT IS OTHERWISE THE AMTRAK SERVICE? AND ON THE WEST SIDE WE WANT EXTEND THE ELECTRIFICATION OF CALTRAIN. FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO SAN JOSE ALL THE WAY TO GILROY. THAT WILL MEAN THAT CALTRAIN WILL NO LONGER HAVE TO USE DIESEL TRAINS FROM GILROY. A GOING NORTH AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM WOULD BE ELECTRIFIED IT WOULD BE READY FOR US AND WE ARE EXAMINING WHETHER WE CAN PUT. HIGH SPEED ELECTRIFIED SERVICE IN THERE AS AN INTERIM BASIS AS EARLY AS TWENTY TWENTY SIX OR TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. SO THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE PLAN WERE DOING THE ANALYSIS NOW AND WILL REPORT BACK. TO LEGISLATURE IN THE PUBLIC ON ON HOW WE CAN PUT THAT INTO PLAY. A AND MARK THAT MORNING OPERATING SEGMENT. WILL RUN TRAINS OF SOME KIND. BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN MADERA AND BAKERS YEAH I WEEKTHAT'S A REQUIREMENT WE HAVE WITH OUR FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENT TODAY. THAT WE PUT THAT AND YOU WE PUT THOSE ASSETS INTO USE YOU YOU CANNOT SAY TODAY THAT. THEY WILL BE HIGH SPEED TRAINS THEY BUT THEY MAY VERY WELL BE SLOW SPEED TRAIN. OUR ASSETS INITIALLY ARE GOING TO ARE NOT SORRY OUR ASSETS FOR THE TIRE ABOUT DEVELOP BEFORE HIGH SPEED TRAIN SERVICE. ONCE WE COMPLETE ALL OF THE SYSTEM INCLUDING THE TUNNELING BETWEEN THE PROJECT WILL PASS. THAT'S STRETCHING THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN GOING WEST WILL TRAVEL IN EXCESS OF TWO HUNDRED MILES PER HOUR. A WHEN WE GET TO THE SILICON VALLEY WILL TRAVEL SPEEDS OF ROUGHLY HUNDRED TEN MILES PER HOUR. THE IN THAT CORRIDOR. SO THAT'S THE SYSTEM THAT WE ALTERNATE WILL BUILD WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE FUNDING IN HAND FOR THAT RIGHT NOW WE LIKELY HAVE A FUNDING GAP. THAT'S ABOUT THE COST OF THE TUNNELS FOR THAT. BUT IN THE INTERIM WE DO WANT TO PROVIDE MOBILITY BENEFITS WHERE WE CAN AND IF WE CAN PUT ELECTRIFIED SERVICE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. SOONER CONNECTING WITH AMTRAK. THAT WE THINK WE REDUCE THE AMTRAK TRAVEL TIME BY NINETY MINUTES AND MAY BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE STATE SUBSIDY FOR THAT SYSTEM. THAT ANALYSIS IS UNDERWAY NOW AND WILL COME BACK A WITH THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT FOR ALL OF YOU YOU DO RECOGNIZE THE SIZE AND THE. DIFFICULT NATURE OF ATTAINING THE GAP FUNDING. FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE TITLES. BUT I DO I DO A AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT. YOU KNOW I WANNA ISOLATED ON ON ON THE TUNNELS I THINK. YOU KNOW MY VIEW IS ONCE YOU HAVE SOME SERVICES RUNNING ON EITHER SIDE. OF THE TUNNEL BECOMES AN OBVIOUS ELEMENT IN CONNECTING THE TWO. BY FOCUSING ON THE TUNNEL. IN BRINGING IN SOME EXPERTISE ON INNOVATIVE WAYS TO FUNDED. AND ENGAGING OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS GOING FORWARD I THINK WE CAN. YOU KNOW I'M CONFIDENT WE'LL FIND AWAITING. WAY TO GET THERE ON THE SPECIFIC ASSET THAT WILL HAVE OBVIOUS MOBILITY BENEFIT WITH THE ELECTRIFICATION. FROM WHAT GILROY TO SAN JOSE M.. THAT'S A LONG. UNION PACIFIC. LINES CORRECT DO YOU HAVE PERMISSION. FOR THAT PURPOSE AS WE INDICATED IN THE PLAN WE ARE NOT WE ARE CURRENTLY IN TALKS WITH YOU P.. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THOSE TALKS POSITIVE? BUT YOU YOU YOU THINK THAT UNION PACIFIC WILL EVENTUALLY AGREE WHAT ALLOW YOU ACCESS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE IN THE ROOM IT'S A NEGOTIATION. AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. A ABOUT THAT IN AND WHAT WE WOULD DO IS USE THAT A RIGHT AWAY TO ELECTRIFY TWO TRACKS THAT ARE FOR PASSENGER RAIL AND MAINTAIN A FREIGHT TRACK FOR THEIR USE. OF IN THE RIGHT AWAY IT IS THE LEAST IMPACTFUL WAY. A TO GET INTO THAT THAT SECTION THAT ULTIMATELY WE WILL NEED. AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM IN GOOD FAITH HE ON TRYING TO GET THAT UP THE THE. YOUR YOUR BUSINESS PLAN ANTICIPATES A RATHER. I THINK. A DUBIOUS APPROACH TO THE FINANCING WHICH IS THE CAP AND TRADE. THAT REQUIRES EXTENSIONS AND THAT AND THE LIKE AND. ARE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WHO SAID THAT A COMPLETE UNVIABLE FUNDING PLAN DOES NOT EXIST. FINDING IT IN THE BUSINESS PLAN SEEMS TO. I'M RELY ON EXTENDING CAP AND TRADE. FROM YOUR BUSINESS PLAN YOUR. SUGGESTING TO PROHIBIT THE LEGISLATURE FROM RESTRICTING REDISTRIBUTE OR IMPAIRING THE AUTHORITIES. CAP AND TRADE FOR THIRTY YEARS. EXTENSION OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THROUGH TWENTY FIFTY. AND GUARANTEED THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL BACK FILL ANY SHORTFALL OF CAP AND TRADE AUCTIONS. BRING IN LESS. REVENUE. UP ARE YOU. AWARE THAT THAT KIND OF A PLAN IS GOING TO REQUIRE A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE. AM I THINK THAT'S A OPEN QUESTION RIGHT NOW. WE ARE I WANT TO SAY THIS ABOUT THE CAP AND TRADE A PROGRAM IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. OTHER WAS AN ASSUMPTION OF CAP AND TRADE REVENUE ALL THE WAY TO TWENTY FIFTY. A AND WE INDICATED THAT FOR BUILDING A MAKE A PROJECT OF THIS SIZE. A YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO FINANCE ANY REVENUE STREAM SO THAT YOU CAN MATCH. REVENUES WITH YOUR CAPITAL COSTS IS YOUR BUILDING A IF WE DON'T A HAVE SOME KIND OF A FINANCING CAPACITY AGAINST THE REVENUE STREAMS DEDICATED THE PRICE. TO THE PROJECT IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO STAY ON SCHEDULE. IN SO JUST AS WE SAID IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE WANT TO TRY TO. BE ABLE TO BRING FORWARD SOME OF THE DOLLARS THAT ARE OTHERWISE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED TO THIS PROJECT. THROUGH THE CAP AND TRADE MECHANISM AND SO. INDUSTRY HAD GIVEN US IT OUT HERE THREE THINGS YOU LOOK FOR FOR THE HIGHEST INVESTMENT GRADE. THAN INVESTMENT GRADE STATUS OF A FINANCING YOU WANNA HAVE NOT IMPAIRMENT YOU WANT TO HAVE A COMMITMENT TO TWENTY FIFTY. ANYONE HAVE A FLORA FUNDING. I DON'T I CAN'T WE DON'T KNOW WE CAN GET ALL THOSE THINGS BUT IT'S NOT A GO OR NO GO WE NEED AUTHORITY TO. FINANCE AGAINST IT WE NEED TO BE IS STRONGEST AS IT COULD BE DE BACK COMMITMENT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN DO THE FINANCING. AND EH HOWEVER STRONG IT IS IN STATUTE AND AND ARTICULATED IN THE LAW. WE WILL GET A IT WILL REFLECT OUR RICH ARE RISK OR COST OF CAPITAL. SO WITH THESE THREE ELEMENTS WITH HAVE THE VERY CHEAPEST CASA CAPITAL WITH ELEMENTS THAT ARE. YOU KNOW SHADES OF GRAY ON IT TO THE BECAUSE CAPITA MICHAEL HIGHER BUT WE WOULD STILL YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S. LARGE SORT OF SWINGS IN IN WHAT YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO DO BASIC FINANCING WATER POINT IS. WE NEED TO FINANCE THE REVENUE STREAM TO BRING THE DOLLARS FOR TO MEET THE CAPITAL COSTS AT THE TIME WE HAVE THEM TO BUILD THE PROJECT. AND THAT WAS SOMETHING WE SAID IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND SOMETHING WE'RE REPEATING TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AGAIN I WANT TO. I REALLY DO WANT TO FOCUS YOU YOU HAVE MADE SOME SPECIFIC. CONTINGENCIES IN THE PLAN TO ACCESS. CAP AND TRADE. AND. ARE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL HAS ADVISED US THAT ONLY A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE CAN REQUIRE. A FUTURE LEGISLATURE TO COMMIT FUNDS OR PROHIBIT A FUTURE LEGISLATURE FROM CHANGING AN APPROPRIATION. ARE YOU AWARE AND DO YOU CONCUR THAT WHAT IS IN YOUR BUSINESS PLAN REQUIRES A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE. I DON'T NECESSARILY CONCUR WITH THAT YET BECAUSE. I DON'T. I DON'T KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE AGAINST THE CAP AND TRADE REVENUE STREAM I THINK. WE NOW HAVE A CONTINUES APPROPRIATION IF WE ARE GIVEN LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO REVENUE BOND OFF THAT APPROPRIATION. OF BUT WE CAN'T DO THE IMPAIRMENT WOULD STILL GO FORWARD WITH TRYING TO FINANCES. MAYBE WITHOUT THE IMPAIRMENT IN MAYBE IT MEANS THAT WE DON'T HAVE AS HIGH RATED. A OF A FINANCIAL STRUCTURES POSSIBLE BUT IT CONTINUES APPROPRIATION IS PRETTY GOOD WHICH WE ALREADY HAVE. OF AN AUTHORITY TO ISSUE REVENUE BONDS OFF THAT'S THAT STREAM IS HELPFUL. A WE WOULD IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO HAVE SOME FLOOR OF A COMMITMENT IN THERE. BUT WOULD THAT UNDER THE LAW TODAY IS A CONTINUES THE APPROPRIATED MATTER WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. A IF THAT'S IF THERE'S A FLOOR THAT'S TIED TO THAT. IT WOULD HELP US FINANCE THE AGAINST THAT REVENUE STREAM BUT IT. BUT FOR FOR THIS MEMBER IT SEEMS PRETTY PRETTY CUT AND DRIED THAT WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING IN THE BUSINESS PLAN IS GOING TO REQUIRE VOTE OF THE PEOPLE IF. YET DUBBED BECOMES A EVIDENT. THAT IN ORDER TO ACTUALIZE THE BUSINESS PLAN. WOULD YOU BE ARE GOING TO GO TO A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE IS THAT AN OPTION. AS YOU CONSIDER. AT LEAST THE BUSINESS PLAN IN FRONT OF THIS WHICH I THINK AT AT DOES ACTUALLY REQUIRE. AT LEAST OF A CHANGE IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION SO I THINK THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME KIND OF VOTE OF THE PEOPLE HERE TO LET YOU DO WHAT YOU ARE PLANNING TO WE WE WE PUT IN THE BUSINESS PLAN. AND AS WE TOUTS THE THREE THINGS YOU NEED FOR THE HIGHEST INVESTMENT GRADE FINANCING WE OUTLINED WHAT THE INDUSTRY GAVE US IS THESE ARE THE THREE THINGS YOU NEED. I LOOK AT IT HAVING COME FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND SAID AND LOOK AT AND SAY. GIVE THOSE ARE THREE THINGS THAT THE INDUSTRY. POINT OUT AS THE HEIGHT BEST THINK YOU NEED FOR AN INVESTMENT GRADE RATING. I DON'T KNOW YOU CAN GET ALL THOSE THINGS AND BUT I DO THINK YOU CAN STILL FINANCE WITH LEFT. AND WILL THEN WHAT WE SAID IN THE PLANS WOULD WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATURE ON EXACTLY WHAT THE FINANCING AUTHORITY LOOKS LIKE. TO GO FORWARD SO I DON'T HAVE A PLAN RIGHT NOW TO GO THE VOTER PEOPLE I'M NOT SURE WE NEED TO GO TO VOTE OF THE PEOPLE. OF WILL LOOK AT THAT AND WE WILL WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW WE CAN BEST DEFINE HOW WE CAN FROM FINANCE AGAINST THE REVENUE STREAM ALREADY COMMITTED TO THE PROJECT. AND OUR HOPE IS TO. GETS SOME KIND OF FINANCING SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE WE CAN DELIVER THE PROJECT IN THE ELEMENTS OF THE PROJECT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE NEED OR PUSH FOR THE FINANCING IS JUST. MAKE SURE WE CAN BE CAPITAL COSTS IN I. THEN AGAIN I I. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL HAS OPINED ON THIS AND I THINK THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT THE OPINION AM I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE PAID ATTENTION TOO HIGH AT. OUT BEFORE YOU RESPOND WITH NOW. KIND OF. GOING THROUGH THIS DISCUSSION SEVERAL TIMES I THINK WE GET IT. FINALLY. I'M GENERALLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT IS PLAN B. IT IT ALMA SURFACE UP THIS DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT'S GOING TO GET COMPLETED. I KNOW YOU YOU YOU ARE OPTIMISTIC AND YOU WANT TO BE INNOVATIVE AND AND ALL OF THAT. BUT THE BUT ECONOMIC GRAVITY HAS REALLY KICKING IN HERE. AND I WANT TO KNOW IF THERE IS A PLAN B.. IT IS WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU JUST SIMPLY. A CANNOT BUILD THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. A ARCTIC ARE YOU CONSIDERING A PLAN BE IS THERE A CONTINGENCY PLAN OF SOME KIND. WELL MISTER PATTERSON I AGAIN I GUESS I'D SAY THAT'S GOING TO BE A CONVERSATION THAT'S A BROADER THAN JUST OFFICES CAN INVOLVE THE LEGISLATURE AND US OF. IT GOING FORWARD I YOU KNOW. I'VE STEPPED INTO THIS AND I KNOW WHAT I HAVE. AND I KNOW THAT IT SHORT OF WHAT WE NEED IN THE PROJECT HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN THAT CONDITION SINCE THE DAY THE VOTERS APPROVE THE RITUAL PONDS. THEY'VE NEVER HAD ALL THE MONEY THEY NEED TO GO. AND SO THE AUTHORITY ADOPTED A PRINCIPLE THAT SAID WITH THE FUNDING WE HAVE WE WILL BUILD INCREMENTALLY TO PROVIDE BENEFITS EARLY. HOPEFULLY LINKING ALL OF THE INVESTMENTS WE MAKE FOR THE FULL SYSTEM. AND. THAT I THINK IS THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO GO WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE EVERY DOLLAR YOU NEED FOR THE FULL SYSTEM. SO I'M PROPOSING A BUSINESS PLAN BASED ON WHAT I KNOW WE HAVE. A AND I KNOW WE HAVE TO DO WORK WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO DO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU. TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN KEEP BUILDING THE SYSTEM. I TOOK THIS JOB I DO THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT. PROJECT FOR THE FUTURE THE STATE I DON'T. ABOUT. X. ESPOUSING TO PLAN BE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I WANT TO MOVE FORWARD ON WHAT WE HAVE AND I WANNA. YOU KNOW SHOW THAT WE CAN DELIVER AND PERFORM. AND AS WE DO THAT I THINK INCREMENTALLY WE CAN BUILD THE SYSTEM. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE AUTHORITY. HAS COMPLETED A CONTINGENCY PLAN DOCUMENT FOR EARLY SERVICE OPERATIONS OF THE FIRST CONSTRUCTION SEX SECTION. THAT THAT WAS REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION OF AS PART OF THE COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT. WITH THEM FOR GRANT FUNDING. PAGE FIFTY ONE OF THE F. R. A. DOCUMENT. ARE YOU AWARE OF A CONTINGENT PLAN. DOCUMENT THAT WAS SUBMITTED TO FRA IN TWENTY A SIXTEEN. ARE AND AND IF O WE. WE WE THINK THAT THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS A CONTINGENCY PLAN THERE I THINK THIS COMMITTEE. OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT AS WELL. IF IT'S WHAT I THINK YOU'RE REFERENCING I BELIEVE IT'S AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE AND IF IT'S NOT AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE I'M HAPPY MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO YOU IF YOU THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT AS I SAID AT THE OUTSET. THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE FEDERAL MONEY WE'RE USING THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE HAVE TO APPLY. A AND PROVIDE THEM WITH THE PLAN OF OPERATION FOR THE ASSETS WE BUILT. AND WE DID PROVIDE THAT IN OCTOBER TWENTY SIXTEEN I THINK IT'S AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE IF IT'S NOT WILL MAKE IT AVAILABLE COMMITTEE RIGHT AWAY RECREATE AND IT'S CONSISTENT I WILL SAY IT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'VE OUTLINED IN THE BUSINESS PLAN OF HOW WE WOULD GO FORWARD. ARE. BOB. ARE ANALYSTS HAVE. REPEATEDLY REQUESTED THAT DOCUMENT YOU'LL HAVE IT TODAY THANK YOU WHICH IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER FUNG. I THINK IT WAS TO CARRY FOR BEING HERE GET. AGAIN AND AT THAT YOU FOR YOUR TERM FOR TESTIMONY AT THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE I WON'T REHASH A LOT OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAD AT THEIR OR. I WAS ONE OF KIND OF GO AND KIND OF A DIFFERENT DIRECTION WHICH IS. THE F. ORTIZ AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES THAT ALL THE WORK IN THE CENTER VALLEY PORTION. THE COMPLETED BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHAT HAPPENS IF THE AUTHORITY FAILS TO MEET THAT DEADLINE. WELL A COUPLE THINGS ONE. WE PROBABLY HAVE TO ENGAGE IN SOME KIND OF NEGOTIATION OF THE UPPER A FOR AN EXTENSION IF POSSIBLE WE'RE NOT THERE YET. BUT I WOULD SAY. THERE YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE OPEN TO. REPAYMENT PROVISIONS OF FEDERAL FUNDS BUT AGAIN I THINK TIPPIT WHAT'S HAPPENED BEFORE. IS THAT WAS ONCE AN EARLIER DEADLINE THAT WAS RENEGOTIATED SOMETIME AGO WELL BEFORE I GOT HERE OUT TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO. WE WORK WITH THE FRA ó ALL THE TIME ON A WEEKLY DAILY BASIS AND THAT WE WOULD OF PROBABLY BEING DISCUSSES IT WITH THEM WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE DEADLINE ABOUT SHOULD IT MOVE BUT ARE. A CERTAINLY OUR INTENTION IN MY OBJECTIVE TODAY IS TO MEET THOSE DEADLINES AS WE ARTICULATED THE BUSINESS SO THERE IS A CONCERN THAT THERE WOULD BE REPAYMENT IF WE DID MEET THAT DEADLINE MINUTES ABOUT WHAT DOES. IT'S THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE ALTHOUGH I THINK IN PRACTICE AS WE'VE ALREADY SEEN WE'VE WE'VE WORKED WITH THE OPERATE RENEGOTIATE DATES BUT I THINK THE BIGGEST CONCERN AS I AS I HEAR YOU ANSWER QUESTIONS. THERE'S A PASSIONATE AND TO AND TO THE PUBLIC AT LARGE IS UP. WE HEAR PHRASES LIKE UNFUNDED ASSETS MISSING LINK. UP FUNDING GAPS AND AT WHAT POINT IS THIS PROJECT COST HIM. BUT IT IS THERE THAT ASSESSMENT THAT YOU THAT YOU WOULD MAKE. YOU KNOW FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE SYSTEM IN THE MOBILITY. THE BENEFITS THAT IT WOULD BRING. THERE WERE SOME WORK DONE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THAT SAID YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU HAVE TO DO TO PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL OF MOBILITY BENEFITS. THROUGH HIGHWAY EXPANSIONS AIRPORT EXPANSIONS AND OTHER THINGS YOU KNOW IT'S ROUGHLY DOUBLE THE COST OF OUR BASELINE COST ESTIMATES. SO I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THAT THAT LINE IS BUT THAT THAT DATA IS OUT THERE TO BAIL BONE IT'S PUBLIC. A I. BOB MY OBJECTIVE IN WHAT WE THAT OUTLINE OF THE BUSINESS PLAN IS TO PROCEED IN A WAY WHERE WE DO NOT HAVE. STRANDED ASSETS WITH THE ASSETS WE BUILT WE PUT INTO USE. A WE DO HAVE UNFUNDED PORTION THE VALLEY TO VALLEY AND WE'RE GONNA FOCUS EFFORT AND TIME ON THAT. UP BUT THE STRANDED ACID ISSUE IS ONE THAT I. WOULD PUSH BACK ON LIGHTLY JUST BECAUSE OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO INVEST IN A WAY WE DO NOT HAVE STRANDED ASSETS GOING FORWARD BUT THINGS ARE BEING PUT INTO GIVES. SO JUST JUST THERE REWRITE IT THERE IS NO POINT THERE IS NO THRESHOLD THAT. IF THE COSTS CONTINUE TO GROW OR EXPAND THAT YOU WOULD NOT AFFORD NO MATTER WHAT NO PUN INTENDED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO POINT. THAT WOULD THINK THAT THE THE PROJECT WOULD BE WE KNOW THAT WE THINK WE NEED TO REASSESS AND THAT THIS PROJECT MAY NOT BE THE WAY TO. GO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS RIGHT NOW TODAY I I THINK YOU KNOW AGAIN I'M BUILDING SOMETHING. WITH AVAILABLE REVENUES I HAVE BEEN INCREMENTAL WAY WE HAVE A COST ESTIMATE THAT WERE. UP FOR THE VALUE VALLEY SECTION THAT I THINK WILL BE A VERY USEFUL A. SEGMENT AND WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE THAT WERE YOU KNOW. WOULDN'T WE CAN CLOSE THE GAP ON I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT OF GOING FORWARD. SO. SO I DON'T HAVE A BETTER ANSWER THAT TODAY ON THAT I'M I'M FOCUSED ON TRYING TO GET IT DONE. AND AS THE MY LAST QUESTION SINCE MAYES CERTAINLY VISIT. BUDGET. THIS TRAP BUSINESS PLAN HAS EVOLVED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PROJECT. YOU DO NOT SEE A POINT WHERE THE PUBLIC SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER SAY ON THIS PROJECT. I MEAN I IT AGAIN. YOU KNOW. OUR I'M HERE TO TRY TO IMPLEMENT THE VOTERS WILL AND AND TO ME. YOU KNOW WE WENT TO THE VOTERS AND ASK FOR ONE FIFTH OF THE THEN. ESTIMATED COSTS AND THEY APPROVED IT. AND I'M SEEING NUMBERS IT SUGGESTS ARE STILL GENERALLY THAT SAME LEVEL OF SUPPORT IN MY JOB IS TRIED TO IMPLEMENT WHAT WE HAVE. AND AND I'M FOCUSED ON THAT AND THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING. AND. LA I HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT BEYOND A USING THE AT THE RESOURCES I HAVE TO TRY TO DELIVER THE PROJECT AS BEST I CAN AND THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT MY FOCUSES BUT WOULD YOU SAY WOULD YOU AGREE THOUGH THAT THAT. WHAT THE VOTERS VOTED ONLINE? IMPROV WHEN A WHEN WHAT THE PROJECT IS TODAY HAS CHANGED NOW FOR ARE NOW I WOULD SAY THAT OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO BUILD THE ONE A SYSTEM AND WE HAVE TO BUILD IT INCREMENTALLY. AND WAY TO BUILD AN INCREMENTALLY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE MONEY WE NEED TO BUILD ALL AT ONCE. AND SO BUT OUR BUT WHAT WE WILL BUILD WILL BE THE ONE A PROJECT BUT THE BUSINESS PLAN HAS CHANGED. THE BIGGEST BUYERS OF ALL IF THE BUSINESS PLAN. EVERY TWO YEARS IS A SNAPSHOT OF WHERE THIS IS I THINK THIS BUSINESS PLAN HAVE SOME CONTINUITY WITH THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUSINESS PLAN IN TERMS OF WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE. AND WHAT THE PRINCIPLES R. THAT WE BRING. THERE ARE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HOW WE PRESENT THOSE THINGS IN THE PAST. AND HOW I PRESENT THEM TO YOU ALL TODAY. AND IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT WE HAVE UNCERTAINTIES AND RISK THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. AND IT MAKES IT HARD TO BUILD A MATE THAT MAKE A PROJECT. BUT. WE WERE YOU KNOW. IT'S. A CANDID DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THOSE UNCERTAINTIES AND RISKS ARE. AND OUR APPROACH IN THE FACE OF THOSE THINGS. AND. AND THAT'S WHY I FEEL LIKE I'M OBLIGATED TO PRESENT TO YOU ALL. AND LAY OUT A STRATEGY FOR HOW WILL GO FORWARD. AND. AND AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE. WAS I I I APPRECIATE THAT YOUR. YOUR TESTIMONY I THINK THAT AS WE REVIEW THE BUSINESS PLAN. I THINK THAT THERE ARE SITES CERTAINLY THAT DIED THAT THE FACT THAT THERE'S UNCERTAINTIES IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. AND I THINK THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE A POINT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DECIDE. THROUGH REALISTICALLY AND OBJECTIVELY AND LOOKING AT THIS WITH LL THE FACTS. AND FRONT OF US THAT WHETHER THIS PROJECT SHOULD MOVE FORWARD AT ALL. AND AND I HOPE THAT THE AUTHORITY WOULD. DO THAT DO THE SAME THING. AND SAY IS THIS FEASIBLE BECAUSE. IF THE GAPS EXIST AND WE CAN'T CONNECTED TO IT BUT TAKE A PASS ISN'T BUILT WE HAVE TO STRANDED LINE. THAT MAY FUNCTION. ON ITS OWN BUT THEY NEVER CONNECTIN SO IF THE IF THE ASSESSMENT IS WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA DO THIS NO MATTER WHAT BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE MY. FROM I THINK WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A REAL ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER THAT'S. WHETHER WE SHOULD GET YOU DOWN THAT PATH SO I THINK YOU MAY MOVE WE WILL CERTAINLY ENGAGED IN THAT CONVERSATION GOING TOWARD ABSOLUTELY FOR ME PERSONALLY. I. I BELIEVE THE THE BENEFITS OF THE PROJECT. ARE. SO IMMENSE THAT IN MY TIME DOING TRANSPORTATION POLICY I HAVEN'T SEEN A. SINGLE PROJECT THAT OFFERS AS MUCH MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFIT. SO I'M SO I'M COMMITTED TO TRY TO GET IT DONE IT JUST IGUESS IT WHAT WHAT WAS THE WIDOW COSTS OF THE PROJECT OWNED BY THE PUBLIC NAY. I THINK IT WAS FORTY FIVE BILLION REFERENCED IN THE. IN THE VOTER PAMPHLET IS MY RECOLLECTION AND AND NOW IT'S IN SEVENTY SEVEN AND NINETY EIGHT BILLION. YEAH AND AT ONE TIME IT WAS THIRTY THREE AND SIXTY FOUR WHAT THAT'S WHY. YOU KNOW I'VE TAKEN APPROACH IN THIS BUSINESS PLAN DID NOT. YOU KNOW COME FORWARD WERE SO EARLY IN THE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT TO TO TO TRY TO SPECIFY SINGLE DOLLAR BUT TO SAY HERE'S OUR. BEST ESTIMATE HERE'S THE RANGERS WERE GOING TO WORK IN. IN THAT MY MANAGEMENT OBLIGATIONS TRY TO COME IN BELOW THAT BASELINE BUT THAT I JUST. I MEAN FROM MY PERSPECTIVE RIGHT THIS IS THIS IS NOT A MONEY THIS IS TAXPAYER MONEY AGAIN SO WE GOTTA MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT THAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. KNOW I WANT TO ASK A FOLLOW UP BOOK AND TO MR FUNK'S. QUESTION AND OTHER OF MISTER KELLY YOU'RE THE CEO OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY AND IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN I SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. IS. A AND AUTHORITY THAT IS REQUIRED UNDER THE TERMS OF BALLOT MEASURE. IS THAT RIGHT I'M SORRY RECALL HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY WAS CREATED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE BALLOT MEASURE. PERCENT NO. THE AUTHORITY ITSELF IS CREATED STATUTES. PRIOR TO THE. TO THE TO THE BALLOT MEASURE TO. PRIOR TO THE BALLOT MEASURE PRIOR TO THAT YES MEASURE YES AT ONE POINT IN TIME. FORGIVE ME I MAY NOT HAVE ALL THIS HISTORY EXECUTIVE BUT IT WAS THE COMMISSION AT ONE POINT IN TIME JUST WITH THE STUDY. THEN IT BECAME A AND AUTHORITY WITH APPOINTED MEMBERS THAN IT WAS AT A BALLOT MEASURE THAT PASSED AND SINCE THAT TIME THEY'VE HAD SOME EXPANDED ENABLING. STATUTES AND WHAT I'M GETTING AT HERE IS OR WHERE I WANT TO GO WITH THIS IS WHAT EXACTLY ARE THE PARAMETERS OF OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT ARE ALLOCATED TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. BECAUSE WHEN I HEAR. MIKE RESPECTFULLY MY COLLEAGUES ASKING YOU TO WEIGH IN ON WHETHER. YOU KNOW SOMETHING SHOULD GO TO THE VOTERS ARE NOT THAT TO ME IS SOMETHING THAT THE GOVERNOR MAY ONE ASK US TO DO BUT IT IS WITHIN. THE. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LEGISLATURE. I THOUGHT I JUST. IF YOU CAN CLARIFY FOR US WHAT TO A. YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AT ME GENERALLY THE AUTHORITIES RESPONSIBILITIES ARE TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT THIS IS. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM AND THAT AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL LET'S WITH THEIR CHARGED WITH DOING. AND. AYE PRIME ARE. I'M APPOINTED BY THE BOARD. AND. RESPONSIBLE TO THE BOARD TO A MANAGE THE ORGANIZATION TOWARD THAT TOWARD THAT OBJECTIVE. THANK YOU I JUST I THINK IT'S A OF HEALTH FOR FOR US TO STEP BACK SOMETIMES AND REMEMBER WHAT THE STRUCTURE IS AND IT IS VERY COMPLICATED DATA. IT'S A COMPLICATED. A STRUCTURE. THAT DOES A WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A VERY COMPLICATED PROJECT. AS WE LEARNED FINANCIAL BASIS. MISTER MONNING OF COURSE. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU MISTER KELLY FOR THE PRESENTATION. FOR YOUR CANDOR. A FOR YOUR PRIOR SERVICE. AS ARE TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY CAN THINK OF NO BETTER PERSON TO TAKE OVER THIS. HERCULEAN TASK. THEN YOU UP PIECING THIS ALL TOGETHER. STATE AND FEDERAL AND WE NEED A BETTER FEDERAL PARTNER. A GOING FOR THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. TO MAKE THIS ALL A REALITY IN PARTICULAR WANT TO CALL OUT AND AND. THANK YOU FOR THE NOT PARTNERSHIP WITH CALTRAIN YOU MENTIONED THE. EXTENSION TO GILROY WHICH WILL BE CRUCIAL FOR PHASING OUT THE DIESEL. ARE IN THAT WHAT IS BEING CALLED THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BOOK AND PROJECT I KNOW WHAT IS THE CALICO TRAIN ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT. IN THOSE ULTIMATELY THE. A SHARED SYSTEM. WHICH IS A. TRULY. FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT FOR ALL THE SILICON VALLEY REGION A YOU KNOW WE HAVE A VERY LOW UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. LOTS OF. REVENUE GENERATION OUT WELL GENERATION. BUT EMPLOYERS ARE HAVING LOTS OF DIFFICULTY. WITH RETAINING EMPLOYEES GIVEN THE COST OF LIVING IN THAT AREA BUT THIS ENTIRE ELECTRIFIED THE PROJECT IS GOING TO. BE TRANSFORMATIVE ECONOMICALLY ENVIRONMENTALLY. AND YOU HAVE BEEN AN EXCELLENT PARTNER WHICH OF HARD THAT I SEE SEAMUS MURPHY FROM CALTRAIN HERE. ALL I'VE SEEN. GOVERNMENT AT WORK IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY IN THAT ENTIRE CORRIDOR LOOKING AT IT. HOLISTICALLY NOT ONLY THE CALTRAIN LINE THE HIGHWAY ONE A ONE GIVEN THE. A MAJOR EMPLOYERS WE HAVE AYE IN THAT AREA AND THE ECONOMIC AND BUDGET IMPORTANCE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I'M GRATEFUL OF FOR THE WORK. I IN THAT REGARD AND. LOOK FORWARD TO A CONTINUAL UPDATES AND HOPEFULLY I AS THIS PROJECT RULES OUT AND AS IT BECOMES A REALITY. WE CAN GET SOME MORE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE TO MAKE THIS ALL. OUT WORK BUT I THINK YOU FOR TAKING ON. THIS OF THE MASSIVE CHALLENGE IN FRONT OF YOU AND I HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE. IN YOUR ABILITIES AND. THE OVERSIGHT CAPABILITY HERE OF SUB THREE AS WILL BE GETTING CONTINUAL UPDATES OF ALL AS THE PROJECT WAS FOR BUT THANK YOU FOR THE PRESS TO. THANK YOU SMALL. PATTERSON. WITH RESPECT TO COST AND TIME AND AND IF I. I'M NOT. UNDERSTANDING IT. PRECISELY. IT APPEARS TO ME. THAT BACK WHEN. THE AUTHORITY GOT THE FEDERAL MONEY. THERE WAS A. THERE WERE CONDITIONS ON IT TO USE IT SO YOU GET IT OUT FAST. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT AS A RESULT OF THAT WE WERE WE WERE ACTUALLY. SHOVING A LOT OF MONEY INTO CONSTRUCTION WHEN WE DID NOT HAVE PROPERTY. AND THAT'S THAT HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT. PROBLEM WITH RESPECT TO COST. AND DELAY. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SOMEWHERE IN SOME OF YOUR EARLY. COMMENTS AND MAYBE IN THE MEDIA. THAT YOU YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THAT I THINK. YOU CHARACTERIZED IT AS WE WE DIDN'T. WE COULD NOT BUT WE DIDN'T. REALLY. PRICE IN AND ANALYZE THE COST AND DELAY RISKS OF. THOROUGHLY AND THAT KIND OF APPROACH. NOW THAT YOUR AT THE HELM OUR WILL THAT BE A. SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED APPROACH ANOTHER WORDS. YOU PUT THE MONEY OUT WHEN YOU GOT THE PROPERTY AND NOT BEFORE. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION. CHAPTER FOUR OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN GOES INTO GREAT DETAIL ON THAT ISSUE AND YOU'RE RIGHT THAT. THE FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT WERE MADE AVAILABLE HAD AN EXPENDITURE DEADLINE ON THEM. TO SPEND BY SEPTEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN. UP SO OF THE AUTHORITY WAS QUICK INTO GOING TO CAN CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS AND. A YOU KNOW IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD ARE ON THE ONE HAND. THE INVESTMENTS IN THE VALLEY HAVE PAID OFF. WITH SOME PRETTY IMPRESSIVE ECONOMIC OUTPUT NUMBERS BY GETTING THAT CONSTRUCTION GOING YOU CAN SEE STRUCTURES AND EMPLOYMENT IN THE AREA. AND THAT'S ALL EXTRAORDINARILY POSITIVE ON ON THE DOWN ON THE FLIPSIDE. YOU'RE RIGHT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE RIGHT AWAY IN HAND A PRIOR TO GOING A RELEASING THOSE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS WHICH MEANS. YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THE RISK. IDENTIFIED IN MITIGATED AND. AS A MATTER PRACTICE GOING FORWARD OF WHAT I'VE SAID IN WHAT WE NOTED IN THE BUSINESS PLAN IS THAT MOVING FORWARD. WE WOULD NOT REPEAT THAT. THAT APPROACH WE WOULD DATA. WE WOULD SORT OF HAVE ALL THE ALL THE THINGS IN THE BOX KNOWN IDENTIFIED IN MITIGATED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY BEFORE WE GO TO CONSTRUCTION CUT THAT HAS CUT CONTRACTING AND AND. COMMITTING BEFORE PROPERTY HAS HAS ALSO LED. BUT AT LEAST I'M AWARE OF ONE LAWSUIT THERE MAY BE MORE WITH RESPECT TO THE SMALL. BOB BUSINESS OWNERS THAT HAD THE CONTRACT. AND IN A CUP AND THAT THERE'D THE COMPANY CONTACT ME IN THEM AND RESTRICT OFFICE AT WILL WITH CONCERN OVER. THEN NOT GETTING PAID ON TIME THAT THERE THAT THEY REALLY NEED TO BE GETTING PAID ON TIME BUT BEYOND THAT. WHERE THE LEAST ONE MAYBE TWO? LAWSUITS MAKE MAYBE MORE ARE ARE WITH. SMALL BUSINESSES THAT MAYBE GOT A MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT FOR UTILITY MOVEMENT AND THAT MAYBE THEY HAD FIVE OR SIX PARCELS THEY WERE ABLE TO. COMPLETE A COUPLE OF THEM HE DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE BALANCE OF THEM. AND AS A RESULT THEY HAVE. UTILIZED ALL OF THEIR. SURE ANY BOND CAPACITY RIGHT THAT. VICTOR PUT IT UP WHICH MEANS. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY THE CAPACITY TO GO AND BID OTHER. PROJECTS OUTSIDE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT COME CONNECTS BACK TO. DECISIONS. TO CONTRACT AND PUSH MONEY OUT BEFORE YOU HAVE THE PROPERTY WHICH NOW HAD THAT. DOMINO EFFECT OF HITTING SOME OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES. I'M AND I'M NOT SO I'M I'M EPRI SHEET THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF IT YOU UNDERSTAND IT AND DOWN HOPEFULLY THAT IT DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. I. I AGREE THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT THANKLESS AND MISTER KELLY I HOPE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN UP BUT I ALSO HOPE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER GREAT RECESSION AND ONE OF THE REASONS. THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WAS PUSHING TO HAVE THAT MONEY SPENT BY TWENTY SEVENTEEN IS TO GET THAT FUNDING ON THE GROUND PEOPLE HIRED AND WORKING. IN ONE OF THE AREAS OF GREATEST UNEMPLOYMENT. CONTINUES TO BE THE CASE UNFORTUNATELY. BUT WAS ONE OF THE AREAS OF HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT. IN IN THE STATE AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. ON FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION UNEMPLOYMENT AND FRESNO COUNTY IS NOW DOWN BELOW TEN PERCENT. A AND THAT GROWTH THERE. IN IN FRESNO COUNTY IS OUTPACING THE REST TO THE STATE THERE'S THIRTY ONE HUNDRED FULL TIME JOBS THAT ARE. EXISTING NOW AS A RESULT OF A OF THIS PROJECT IN THAT AND THAT FUNDING SO. YE AYE I GET THE YOU KNOW THE DOWNSIDE IS YOU ARE AND I'M NOT FAULTING YOU FOR THIS BUT YOU KIND OF GLOSSED OVER THE FLIP SIDE OF IT POSITIVE BENEFIT. THAT. THOUGHT THAT THIS IS BOB BROUGHT TO THE STATE YOU DID MENTION A JOB THAT YOU DID A VERY VERY QUICKLY. AND I ITEM I THINK. WHEN WE EVALUATED PROJECT OF THIS MAGNITUDE WE HAFTA TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING THAT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY HERE AND IN THIS COMMITTEE AND. THE OF THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT OF A PROJECT LIKE THIS SIMPLY CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED PARTICULARLY IN A COUNTY THAT HAS SUFFERED THE. WORST UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CLUB FRESNO COUNTY. HAS SEEN TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY ABSENCE THE PROJECT BROKE GROUND IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO BE SPENDING IN ONE COUNTY AND I'M GLAD THAT WE ARE. YES MISTER CHAIRMAN I IN I I THINK I SAID WAS SORT OF A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD THE UPSIDE IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN ECONOMIC IMPACT FROM THE. THE INVESTMENT IN OUR WE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE ASSETS THAT THAT ARE IMPORTANT BUT. YOU SAID EIGHTEEN HUNDRED TRADE WILL QUOTE CRAP LABORS ARE OUT WORKING ON THE JOB TODAY A THAT NUMBER WILL GROW AS WE GET IT EXPANDED CONSTRUCTION SITES. GOING TO FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN SMALL BUSINESSES AND AT A CALIFORNIA BEEN WORKING ON THE PROJECT FROM UP AND DOWN THE STATE. AND I THINK BY ONE ESTIMATE ABOUT A THIRD OF THE JOB CREATION INTO ECKSTINE SEVENTEEN. A PRESENT COUNTY WAS TIED TO THIS PROJECT SO VERY PROUD OF THAT AND THEN THINK THAT THERE'S NO DOUBT IT IS HAD THIS GREAT ECONOMIC IMPACT DESPITE. THE INFUSION OF THE DOLLARS IN IN THIS INVESTMENT AND THEN AS I SAID. THERE ARE THREE ELEMENTS OF THIS PROJECT THAT I AM SO ATTRACTED TO IT FOR AND THAT IS. ENVIRONMENTAL. MOBILITY AND. ANNA AND ECONOMIC AND THE ECONOMIC NUMBERS ARE A. ARE LOUD IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WILL EXPAND. AS WE. IS WE MOVE THE PROJECT FORWARD. NOW. YOU ALSO RESPONDED TO AN EARLIER QUESTION AND ABOUT THE. A COST OF THE PROJECT AND DATA. YOU KNOW WHETHER THE PROJECT BILL HAS VALUE EVEN IF THE COST GOES UP. DIFFERENT NOT AND YOU MENTIONED. THAT YOU NEEDS TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT WERE MEASURING AGAINST AND YOU MENTIONED DATA. HIGHWAY EXPANSION AND AIRPORT EXPANSION AS TWO OF THOSE YOU'RE THE FORMER TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SIERRA. THE PROBABLY THE IDEAL PERSON TO BE ASKING THIS QUESTION AND THAT IS. HOW MUCH CAPACITY DO WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ACTUALLY SPEND MONEY TO A A EXPAND HIGHWAYS? ARE AND AND TO EXPAND AIRPORTS AND. ADDED A LAWYER ANSWERING THAT QUESTION OF YOU MIGHT WANT TO. A TOUCH ON WHETHER OR NOT AIRPORT EXPANSION HIGHWAY EXPANSION IF WE COULD DO IT. COMPORTS WITH OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS. THE SHORT ANSWER IS IT'S VERY CONSTRAINED IN. MANY AREAS OF THE STATE PARTICULAR URBAN AREAS IN TERMS OF. THE ABILITY TO EXPAND. HIGHWAYS FURTHER IN SOME PLACES THE HIGHWAY STRUCTURE IS LARGELY BUILT OUT. IN AN URBAN AREAS. IN OTHER AREAS THERE SOME OPPORTUNITY AYE. AYE. AND OF COURSE I THINK EVERY MAJOR AIRPORT IN CALIFORNIA IS LOOKING TO EXPAND IN SOME WAY IN THE HAVING GREAT DIFFICULTY IN IN DOING SO. I AS A SORT OF CLIMATE CHANGE A MATTER OBVIOUSLY. A TO ME THAT THAT THE BENEFIT THAT THAT I SEE SO ATTRACTIVE ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS WITH AN ADDITIONAL WAY TO MOVE BETWEEN TWO POINTS. IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME IT TAKES IN TO DRIVE TODAY IS THE. IS TO ME THE ONE OF THE KEY BENEFICIAL ELEMENTS OF THIS PROJECT AND I'M TRYING TO PROVIDE. I CALIFORNIANS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY GET BETWEEN A AND B. HAD A FRACTURE THE TIME THEY CAN OTHERWISE DO IT. AND AND SO A THAT IS IS THE KEY ELEMENT IN OBVIOUSLY. SIMPLY. ADDING MORE LANES AND MORE CARS WOULD WOULD. CONTINUE WHAT HAS BEEN OF A LONG HISTORY CALIFORNIA OF SERIOUS CONGESTION AND AIR QUALITY ISSUES. THAT IF YOU OVERLAY. WHERE THIS PROJECT WOULD BE IT'S MOST MOST? THE AREAS MOST IMPACTED BY BOTH THOSE ISSUES. SO. YOU KNOW IN SHORT IT'S A. IT'S A GOOD TRAVEL ALTERNATIVE MADE AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA'S THAT HAVE A LOT OF UPSIDE IN TERMS OF MOBILITY IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND. AND THAT'S WHY I'M SO INTERESTED IN. THANK YOU I OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN MATEO. A MENTION THE HOUSING ISSUE AND AND. AT THE NEED TO MOVE PEOPLE FROM A HIGH DROPS RICH AREAS TO HOUSING RICH AREAS AND TO WORK ACT. CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOUSING AND JOBS IN VARIOUS PARTS. OF THE OF THE STATE I CERTAINLY THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON BUT WE. I THINK OFTENTIMES LOSE SIGHT OF THE FUNDAMENTAL REASONS THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. THAT THAT THE REASONS FOR BUILDING A HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. AND TO IT'S WORTHWHILE FOR US TOUCH ON THOSE PERIODICALLY. I A FOR THOSE WHO OF A FOLLOW MY. TWITTER ACCOUNT. FOLKS HAVE SEEN MAY. OUT GET UPSET AS I SIT ON THE TARMAC. AT AT AND LA ACTS BECAUSE THERE AREN'T GATES OPEN. I AND THAT AND WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. WHERE WE ARE IN TIME AND WHERE WE WANT STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BE IN THAT IN A FEW YEARS TO WE WANT OUR REMAIN STATIC AND NOT BE ABLE TO IMPROVE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WE CAN? ACCOMMODATE A GROWING POPULATION SO THAT WE CAN A ACCOMMODATE. THE TRANSFER NAY TATIAN NEEDS OF FLOOD OF COMING DECADES AND FOR NOT THINKING BIG PICTURE ABOUT THAT THAT I THINK WERE REALLY MAKING A BIG MISTAKE. SO I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION OF THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WE HAVE ACTUALLY HAVE TWO OTHER PANELS ON THE. ON THIS. TOPIC OF SUB TACTICS THEIR RENDON TO WILLA. MOVE ON TO A PANEL NUMBER TO THANK MISTER CHAIRMAN. REST YOUR STAFF CAN BE SO QUIET EXTENT. IF THEY THEY MIGHT PREFER IT THAT WAY. OF. PANEL TO. IS AN EVALUATION OF THAT TWENTY EIGHTEEN DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN WE HAVE. AT LEE THOMPSON THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED. RAIL PEER REVIEW GROUP. A AND THAT TOM VAN HE. IT'S GOING POLICY ANALYST WITH THE. LA JOH. AND WE'LL START WITH MISTER THOMPSON. WELCOME SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF I'M I'VE MONTH. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY THAT I'M GRATEFUL FOR IT TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS LUKE THOMPSON I'M THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PEER REVIEW GROUP THE REPORTS THE LEGISLATURE ON ISSUES RELATED TO HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITIES BUSINESS PLANS AS YOU MAY KNOW. THE PEER REVIEW GROUP WAS CREATED AND PROPOSITION ONE A THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE EIGHT OF US THERE HAVE BEEN. DOING THREE AND SEVEN THAT ONE TIME AT THE OTHER. AND OUR JOB OFFICIALLY IS TO COMMENT ON THE BUSINESS PLANS BUT WE ALSO HAVE COMMENTED ON OTHER THINGS THAT THE AUTHORITY IS DOING. THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE THUS FAR WRITTEN FIFTEEN LETTERS TO THE LEGISLATURE ON ONE OR THE OTHER TOPICS MANY OF THE BUSINESS PLANS BUT. OTHER TOPICS THAT WE HAVE THOUGHT WERE IMPORTANT. WE SENT A LETTER TO THE LEGISLATURE COMMENTING ON THE DRAFT TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN ON MARCH THE THIRTIETH. I WANT TO SUMMARIZE YOUR COMMENTS HERE TODAY THEY FALL INTO TWO CATEGORIES ONE IS THE POLICY CHANGES. AND THE OTHER OR SOME SUBSTANTIVE COMMENTS THAT WE HAVE ON THE BUSINESS PLAN ITSELF. A POLICY ISSUES I BELIEVE ARE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE DETAIL COMMENT SO I WANT TO ADDRESS THEM FIRST. THE GROUP BELIEVES THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT HAS NOW REACHED A POINT WHERE DIFFICULT DECISIONS NEED TO BE MADE ABOUT THE PROJECTS FUTURE SCOPE IN FUNDING. QUITE SIMPLY. AS A RESULT OF COST INCREASES IN CHANGES IN FUNDING SOURCES. THE AUTHORITY CAN NO LONGER COMPLETE THE LINK FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO EITHER THE LA BASIN OR SAN JOSE AND THE PENINSULA. THE US AS IT STANDS TODAY THERE IS LITTLE PROSPECT OF THE SYSTEM THAT WOULD GENERATE ENOUGH CASH FLOW. PICTURE HERE CONTRIBUTE TO FUTURE INVESTMENT. THIS BILL LIMIT DOES NOT COME AS A SURPRISE IT HAPPENS NEARLY EVERY TIME WHEN WE TRY TO TRANSLATE A MEGA PROJECT FROM A GRAND VISION. INTO A WORKING SYSTEM AND IS NOT NECESSARILY A REFLECTION ON THE CONFIDENCE HER HONESTY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO RUN THE PROJECT. THE CRITICAL QUESTION THOUGH IS WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE. THE DRAFT PLAN DOESN'T REALLY DISCUSS OPTIONS IN ADDRESSING THIS QUESTION OF MISTER PATTERSON YOU RAISED THIS QUESTION. THE GROUP PLAYED OUT FOR VERY GENERAL OPTIONS IN OUR LETTER BUT WE DON'T PRETEND THAT THESE ARE THE ONLY ONES ARE THAT PEOPLE COULDN'T COME UP WITH BETTER ONES. THE FIRST OPTION IS WE COULD JUST STOP AND GO HOME PAYOFF WATER WE HAVE TO PAY OFF IT STOPPED. THE SECOND IS WE COULD COMPLETE THE WORK IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY-ALONG WITH WHATEVER CONTRACT OBLIGATIONS WE HAVE ON THE BOOKENDS. THE THIRD WE COULD ADOPT WHAT IS IN EFFECT THE PROPOSAL IN THE DRAFT PLAN. ANNA ANNA CONNECTION TO GILROY IN BAKERSFIELD AND APPROVE THE LA UNION STATION WHILE AWAITING BETTER COMMAND OVER THE DESIGN AND COST OF BETRAY CHO PASSED PANELS. MORE FOURTH WE COULD RE COMMIT TO THE FULL PHASE ONE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT SUCH A DECISION WOULD HAVE TO BE BASED ON ADOPTION OF A CREDIBLE LONG TERM. PLAN TO FINANCE THE SYSTEM. INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY THAT SYSTEM COSTS MIGHT WELL COMMAND AT THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE. WE DON'T DO THE FIRST OPTION SIMPLY STOPPING AS CREDIBLE. IT WOULD LEAVE CALIFORNIA WOULD NOTHING USEFUL AND THE STATE MIGHT HAVE TO PAY BACK THE FEDERAL MONEY. THE SECOND OPTION STOPPING WITH THE CENTRAL VALLEY PLUS THE EXISTING BOOKEND IMPROVEMENTS WOULD WORK. BUT IT WOULD ELIMINATE THAT IT WOULD IT WOULD LIMIT THE VALUE OF THE RESULT. THE THIRD OPTION IS IN THE DRAFT PLAN. PROBABLY MAKES THE BEST OF THE EXISTING SITUATION ESPECIALLY IN BRINGING NEAR TERM BENEFITS TO THE MILLIONS OF CURRENT PASSENGERS. ON THE BOOKENDS. BUT IT LEAVES THE STATE SHORT OF THE SYSTEM THAT WILL BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO FINANCING OF THE REMAINDER OF THE SYSTEM. THE FOURTH OPTION COMPLETING PHASE ONE AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF PROPOSITION ONE A. BUT CANNOT BE DONE WITH THE CURRENT FUNDING PROVISIONS AND SOURCES. SIMPLY PUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT IS FAIR OR CREDIBLE ANY LONGER TO ASK MANAGEMENT TO DELIVER A LONG TERM PROJECT OF THIS SIZE AND COMPLEXITY. WITH SOURCES OF FUNDING BETTER INADEQUATE IN TOTAL AND UNRELIABLE IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. IF THE PROJECT IS TO GO AHEAD BEYOND ESSENTIALLY DISHONORABLE. THE STATE WILL NEED TO DEVELOP A SOURCE OF FUNDING THAT IS UP TO THE TASK THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE. IT WAS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FUNDING GAP OF SUCH AS LOVE. MISTER KELLY SAID AND IT WAS VERY CLEAR IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUSINESS PLAN THAT THERE WAS A GAP. THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE FUNDED IN ORDER TO BUILD A SYSTEM TO THE POINT WHERE IT COULD BEGIN TO GENERATE POTENTIAL INVESTMENT FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR. WHAT IS NEW IS INCREASING SIZE OF THE GAP ALONG WITH THE CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEED TO MAKE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITIES FUNDING STABLE AND PREDICTABLE? THEIR OBVIOUS WAYS TO FILL THE GAP INCREASED THE CAN'T SHARE OF CAP AND TRADE RECEIPTS GOING TO THE AUTHORITY. AND GUARANTEE THE AUTHORITIES INCOME. A TAX ON FUELS OUR SALES TAX WAS PROPOSED IN THE TWO THOUSAND BUSINESS PLAN. THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES THAT MIGHT EMERGE LIKE FUTURE FEDERAL GRANT PROGRAMS FEDERAL PROBLEM WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IF EVEN THE THIRD OPTION IS TO BE COMPLETED. IN PARALLEL WITH DEALING WITH THE NEED FOR AN IMPROVED APPROACH THE FUNDING ESPECIALLY THE STATE'S ROLE BECAUSE THE STREETS ROLE IS LIKELY TO GROW. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE RE VALIDATE THE PRIORITY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE LIGHT OF THE COMPETING THEY'LL USE ELSEWHERE IN TRANSPORTATION AND ELSEWHERE IN THE OVERALL BUDGET. THIS IS A TASK AT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION ALONG WITH THE COMMUNITIES AFFECTED WOULD BE WELL SUITED TO CARRY OUT FOR THE LEGISLATURE. WE DO HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS AS I SAID AT THE OUTSET FOR SPECIFIC CHANGES IN THE FINAL PLAN. THEY SHOULD INCLUDE INPUTS FROM NEARLY OPERATOR WE HAVE RECOMMENDED FOR MANY YEARS AND THE EARLY OPERATOR WOULD BE ABLE TO ADVISE THEM ON HOW TO BUILD THE SYSTEM AND HOW IT SHOULD BE NATURE PLANT OPERATOR. THOSE INPUTS ARE NOT YET AVAILABLE BUT THEY SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THEY SHOULD PROVIDER BETTER IT AND IT EXPLANATION OF THE BUSINESS MODEL. IT MAY LOOK LIKE THIS IS A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT RIGHT NOW AND IT IS BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IT IS LONG RANGE THEY'RE ACTUALLY BUILDING A BUSINESS TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND YET THE THEY WAY IN WHICH THEY WANT TO PROVIDE THAT BUSINESS INSTRUCTOR THEMSELVES IS NOT AT. ALL CLEAR AND THAT NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED. THEY NEED TO PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON DEVELOPING DETAILED AGREEMENTS WITH THE BOOK AND OPERATORS AND THE PRE PARROTS THUS FAR. THOSE AGREEMENTS HAVE NOT REACHED THE LEVEL AT WHICH THEY REALLY NO HOW'S IT GOING TO HAPPEN EIGHT HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO COST AND HOW WELL THEY WORK TOGETHER. THEY NEED TO DEVELOP A LONG RANGE PROGRAM FOR ADDRESSING GREAT CROSS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE SECTION GILROY TWO OF. SAN JOSE NOW WILL BE MORE OF A CONVENTIONAL OPERATIONS WILL BE EVEN MORE GRADE CROSSINGS THAN THERE ARE NOW. AND HIGH SPEED TRAINS DON'T MIX WITH GREAT PRICE. THEY NEED TO CLARIFY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEM AS THEIR SHOWN IN THEIR TRIP TIME CALCULATIONS AND SCHEDULED BECAUSE THE STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM HAS CHANGED. AND THEREFORE HOW WILL IT OPERATE AND FUTURE. THEY NEED TO CONTINUE THE EMPHASIS ON SHOWING THEIR PROJECTION AS RANGERS RATHER THAN POINT ESTIMATES ACTUALLY. THERE IS NO POINT ESTIMATE THAT THE THERE'S A HIGH LEVEL THERE'S A LOW LEVEL AND ALL KINDS OF OUTCOMES IN BETWEEN THERE MAY NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF PRESENTING THAT. AND THEY NEED TO PROVIDE BETTER ACT OF BACKUP FOR THEIR CLAIMS FOR BENEFITS IN PUBLIC BENEFITS URBAN AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT. WELL WE HOPE THESE CAN BE ADDRESSED IN THE FINAL PLAN WE BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE'S IMMEDIATE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON THE FUNDING AND POLICY ISSUES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER THOMPSON NO YOU ALWAYS FIND A VERY OUT OF THE PRESENT US WITH A VERY ORGANIZED. AWARE FRAMING THE ISSUES I REALLY.

GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING I BELIEVE A HAND OUT HAS BEEN PASSED OUT AT ITS. GREAT MY REMARKABLE PARALLEL INTO TO FEEL FREE TO. FOLLOW LONGTIME EQ WITH THE LA O. ROSS BROWNER OFF HIS CAP AND TRADE EXPERT IS ALSO HERE. WITH US THIS MORNING PANEL TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IN THAT REGARD SPECIFICALLY. AS YOU KNOW STATE LAW REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY TO PREPARE A BUSINESS PLAN EVERY EVEN YEAR THAT PROVIDE CERTAIN KEY INFORMATION ABOUT THE PLAN HAS BEEN REAL PROJECT OUR OFFICE TYPICALLY REVIEWS THAT PLAN OFFERS COMMENTS ANALYSIS IN A SETTING SUCH AS THIS ONE. THIS PRESENTATION THIS MORNING GOING TO PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE PLAN TAKES BE REAL SYSTEM. DESCRIBE MAJOR CHANGES PROPOSED IN THE DRAFT TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN AND IDENTIFY ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. WE PICKING UP TO HAND OUT ON PEACH TO AND. WHICH IS SUCH THAT THE BACKGROUND OF COURSE PROPOSITION ONE A WE DISCUSSED THAT THIS MORNING. IN ADDITION TO. AUTHORIZING TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN BONTA FORTY TO SUPPORT CONSTRUCTION THE PROJECT THAT ALSO SET A VARIETY OF. SYSTEM CRITERIA FOR THE STUDENTS IN NEED INCLUDING TRAIN SPEEDS AND TRAVEL TIMES BETWEEN CERTAIN KEY. DESTINATIONS. OVERALL THE PROJECT VISION HAS BEEN DIVIDE INTO TWO PHASES AB IS ONE OF THE SYSTEM WOULD PROVIDE SERVICE FOR ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILES. FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO ANAHEIM PIECE TO WOULD CONNECT THAT SYSTEM NORTH OF SACRAMENTO AND SELF THE SAN DIEGO. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE AUTHORITY ESTIMATED FEE IS ONE OF THE SYSTEM WOULD BE COMPLETED IN TWENTY TWENTY NINE. AT A COST OF SIXTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND AT THIS TIME IS NOT PROVIDED ESTIMATES OF THE COST OR SCHEDULE FOR FEES TO. ON PAGE THREE ALL DISCUSS THE PROJECT DELIVERY PLAN FOR PHASE ONE. PLEASE ONE HAS BEEN DIVIDED INTO SEGMENTS. THE INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENTS WHEN WE DISCUSSED THIS MORNING THAT WOULD CARRY PASSENGERS FROM THE SILICON VALLEY TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE VALLEY TO VALLEY WINE. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE AUTHORITY ESTIMATED THAT THE I. O. S. WOULD COST ABOUT TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS INITIALLY OPERATE BETWEEN SAN JOSE. AND ADJOURNMENTS OR THE BAKERSFIELD STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. CONSTRUCTION OF THE IOWA BEGAN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WITH THE ICE YES THAT THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT THAT'S THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE SEGMENT RUNNING THROUGH CENTRAL VALLEY. FROM THAT ERA SOMEONE WITH THE FRESN TO CHAPTER SOMEWHAT NORTH OF BAKERSFIELD. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE AUTHORITY ESTIMATED COMPLETING CONSTRUCTION OF THE I CS AT A COST OF SEVEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. A PAGE FOR ALL DISCUSS THE THREE. PRIMARY SOURCE THE CAPITAL FUNDING THAT I GOT THE PROJECT THUS FAR THOSE INCLUDE COURSE PROPOSITION ONE A BONDS. THE PROPOSITION AUTHORIZES STATE SELL TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM. AT THIS TIME THE STATUS SOLD ABOUT TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT AUTHORITY. AND SPENT WERE COMMITTED ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF THOSE BONDS SOLD. SECOND OR FEDERAL FUNDS THE AUTHORITY HAS RECEIVED A TOTAL OF THREE AND HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS COMPRISE A GRANT THROUGH THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT. AS WELL AS WHAT'S COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE FY TEN GRANT AND NINE HUNDRED TWENTY MAY PUTTING A MILLION DOLLAR GRANT. WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN EXPENDED ON LIKE THOSE ARE FUNDS WHICH ARE FULLY EXPENDED BY THEIR DEADLINE IS SEPTEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN. FINALLY CAP INTRODUCTION REVENUES. THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED LEGISLATION TO CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATE BEGINNING IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF ANNUAL CAP AND TRADE OPTION REVENUE FOR THE PLANNING A CAPITAL COSTS OF FEES ONE. OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT AT THIS TIME A TOTAL OF ROUGHLY ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN CAP AND TREAT REVENUES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO THE AUTHORITY. AS OF DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE AUTHORITY REPORTED SPENDING ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF THOSE FUNDS. ON PAGE SIX ALL BEGAN DESCRIBING SOME OF THE MAJOR FEATURES OF THE DRAFT TWENTY EIGHTEEN PLAN ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY SOME THOSE BEEN DESCRIBED ALREADY THIS MORNING SO I WON'T DWELL ON THEM TO WANT. AB FIRST IT'S WORTH NOTING AGAIN THAT THE PROJECT SCOPE TIME MIGHT HAVE CHANGED IN THE DRAFT TWENTY EIGHTEEN PLAN VERSES THE LAST ITERATION OF THE OF A BUSINESS PLAN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. THE AYE AYE WEST NOW WILL EXTEND FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO BAKERSFIELD RATHER THAN FROM SAN JOSE TO CHAPTER THAT'S CONNECTING TO LARGER POPULATION CENTERS. THE PLAN ALSO SEEMS A DELAY IN OPERATION OF THE IOS THAT NOW PROPOSED TO OPERATE FOUR YEARS LATER IN TWENTY TWENTY NINE AND RATHER THAN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AS PREVIOUSLY ASSUMED. THE BOTTOM OF PAGE FIVE HAS A NAP BILL STREET IN THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE PHASE ONE PROJECTS THAT WHICH COULD BE HELPFUL. AS WE'VE HEARD ENTRANCE OFFICES ARE PROPOSED ON COMPLETED CONSTRUCTION SEGMENTS. PREVIOUSLY UNDER THE TWENTY SIXTEEN PLAN NO REAL SERVICES WERE EXPECTED TO BEGIN UNTIL FOR COMPLETION OF THE IOS. HOWEVER THE DRAFT TWENTY EIGHTEEN PLAN PROPOSES OPERATING EARLY ENTRANTS OFFICES ON THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT AS REFERRED AS WELL AS ON THE SAN FRANCISCO TO GILROY CORD WORK. THE PLAN SUGGESTS THAT THE COMPLETED SEGMENTS COULD HOST ENHANCE CALTRAIN OR AMTRAK SERVICES WERE POTENTIALLY ABBREVIATED HIGH SPEED RAIL OPERATIONS. PROJECT CONSTRUCTION COSTS HAVE BEEN REVISED UPWARD AS WE'VE HEARD THIS MORNING. AT THE CENTRAL COST ESTIMATE TODAY'S SEVEN SEVEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS ABOUT THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS HIGHER THAN IT WAS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AT CAPITAL COST ESTIMATES ARE PRESENTED THEM FOR PHASE ONE IN THE TABLE AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE% SIX IN THOSE COMPARE COSTS BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND EIGHTEEN PLANTS FOR YOUR REFERENCE. YOU THIRTY STATES THAT GREATER CONTINGENCY ESTIMATES COST ESCALATION TO SCHEDULE BELIEVES AND INCREASED COSTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT ACCOUNT FOR MOST OF THE OVERALL COST INCREASE FOR THE PROJECT. TODAY THE DRAFT PLAN REFLECTS AN INCREASING CONSTRUCTION COSTS WOULD BE AYE WES FROM TWENTY POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO TWENTY NINE POINT FIVE. THE PROJECT FUNDING PLANNED TO DATE IDENTIFIES FOR FUNDING FOR THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT RIVER THAT THAT HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES THROUGH THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THE SOURCES INCLUDE PROPOSITION ONE A BOND FUNDS FEDERAL GRANTS AND CAP AND TRADE REVENUES. THE PLAN ASSUMES THE FURTHER EXTENSION OF THE CABINETRY PROGRAM AND THEN THE SECURITIZATION OF THOSE REVENUES TO COMPLETE THE IOWA THING A FULL OPERATING SEGMENT BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO BAKERSFIELD. THAT MEANS IS EXTENDING THE PROGRAM THROUGH TWENTY FIFTY AND. WHILE THAT PERMITS CURRENTLY ONLY AUTHORIZED THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY. FINALLY THE PLAN ASSUMES ADDITIONAL FUNDING BECOMES AVAILABLE FOR THE REMAINDER FACE ONE. AT THIS TIME THE BALANCE OF FEES ONE WHICH WOULD BE CONSTRUCTING SOUTH FROM BAKERSFIELD INTO WHAT SINGLE ANAHEIM IS EXPECTED TO COST FORTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. AND THE DRAFT PLAN ASSUMES A FUND BECOMES AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT THOSE COSTS WHILE THE PLANT IS NOT IDENTIFY SPECIFIC FUNDING SOURCES AND AMOUNTS IT DOES DISCUSS THE POTENTIAL OPTIONS INCLUDING A COMBINATION OF FEDERAL SOURCES. WE'RE BORROWING AGAINST THE NET OPERATING REVENUES OF THE INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT. THE PLAN RAISES SEVERAL ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION THE FIRST BEING THAT THE ACTUAL PROJECT COST COULD BE EVEN HIGHER THAN THE SET FOR COST ESTIMATE INDICATES. AS WE'VE HEARD THIS MORNING THE AUTHORITY NOW INTRODUCES COSTS ANY RANGING THAT IS AN IMPROVEMENT IN THIS PLAN IS MORE TRANSPARENT ON THE FULL POTENTIAL COST OF CONSTRUCTION. IT DOES MEAN HOWEVER THAT. PHASE ONE COULD COST AS MUCH AS NINETY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AND HAS PUT THE SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE CENTRAL COST ESTIMATE. SECOND THERE SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING FUNDING TO COMPLETE THE IOS. A LARGE PORTION OF THE FUNDING IDENTIFIED FOR THAT PROJECT WOULD COME FROM BORROWING AGAINST FUTURE CAP AND TRADE AUCTION REVENUES THROUGH TWENTY FIFTY. THE US WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO EXTEND THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THOSE FUNDS WOULD BE AVAILABLE. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEVEL OF OXEN REVENUES ASSUMED IN THE DRAFT PLAN DO NOT MATERIALIZE WERE THE PROJECTS COSTS ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN ESTIMATED. THE STATE WOULD ALSO NEED TO IDENTIFY OTHER FUNDS WERE TO TO HELP FINANCE THE I WAS INCLUDING POTENTIALLY THE GENERAL FUND. THIRD THERE'S NO COMPLETE FUNDING PLAN FOR THE REMAINDER OF FEES ONE WHILE THE PLAN DISCUSSES THE POSSIBILITY OF SECURE TYPE THING THE NET OPERATING REVENUES OF THE INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT. THERE ARE POTENTIAL CHALLENGES THIS APPROACH. FIRST IT'S UNCLEAR THAT INITIAL SYSTEM WILL GENERATE AN OPERATING SURPLUS. SECOND YOU FORTUITOUS PIZZA SECURITIZED IN THE NECK CASH FLOW WOULD MAKE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AVAILABLE NO SOONER THAN TWENTY THIRTY TWO. EVEN THOUGH FUNDS WOULD LIKELY BE NEEDED EARLIER TO COMPLETE PHASE ONE BY TWENTY THIRTY THREE AT THE SUIT. THIRD THE PLAN ESTIMATES THAT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT CAN BE GENERATED WOULD FALL SUBSTANTIALLY SHORT OF THE LEVEL NEEDED TO COMPLETE PHASE ONE DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY HOW THAT SHORTFALL. BE THAT. IF YOU OF THOSE CONCERNS ARE OUR FOURTH ISSUE FOR CONSIDERATIONS MORNING IS THAT IF WILL FUNDING PLAN. IS CRUCIAL FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT SUCCESS AND AT THIS TIME IT COMPLETE VITAL FUNDING PLAN DOES NOT EXIST. HAPPY DAY ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORT SAID WE HAVE A QUESTIONS. PATTERSON FAIRVIEW BACK INFO ABOUT MISTER PHONE. I I WANTED. I WANNA VISIT THAT THAT THE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL IN THE. A BUSINESS PLAN WITH RESPECT TO. AND I'M READING FROM THE PLAN. PROHIBIT THE LEGISLATURE FROM RESTRICTING RE DISTRIBUTING OR IMPAIRING THE AUTHORITIES CAP AND TRADE APPROPRIATION FOR THIRTY YEARS. EXTENSION OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THROUGH TWENTY FIFTY. AND GUARANTEE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL BACK FEEL ANY SHORTAGE IF CAP AND TRADE AUCTIONS BRING IN LESS REVENUE. ARE THEN. PROJECTED. EARLIER AYE AYE AYE QUESTIONED NO. WITH RESPECT TO THE VIABILITY OF DOING THIS WITHOUT. THEY VOTE OF THE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S ADVICE PARTICULARLY THAT. BUT WHAT THE PEOPLE GOING TO BE REQUIRED. WHO FUTURE LOOK BUT THE LEGISLATURE TO COMMIT CRIMES OR PROHIBIT? A FUTURE LEGISLATURE FROM CHANGING AND AN APPROPRIATION. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY. FINANCE PLAN WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW. IS IS I THINK VERY MUCH IF. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE. BUT A VOTE BECAUSE THE CONSTITUTION I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT YOU YOU JUST CAN'T DO THIS KIND OF. COMMITMENT. LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE THE LEGISLATURE OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. DO YOU CONCUR THAT THAT FINANCING PLAN DOES HAVE A. AND ELEMENT TO IT THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE OF A VOTER ENGAGEMENT. IT COMES DOWN TO THE SPECIFICS OF THE PROPOSED FINANCIAL. PACKAGE AND WE HAVEN'T CONFERRED WITH COUNSEL THIS TIME SOME NOT POSITION GIVE A DEFINITIVE ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT IT WOULD CERTAINLY DEPEND ON ON THE DETAILS OF THE PROPOSED FINANCING. IT'S NOT INCONCEIVABLE THAT IT WOULD BUT AS I MENTIONED WITHOUT CONFERRING WITH COUNSEL IT CAN'T SEE ANYMORE. WITH RESPECT TO USING. IN CAP AND TRADE REVENUE OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. I THOUGHT THE PRESUMPTION WITH RESPECT A CAP AND TRADE THAT THAT WAS THAT IT WAS GOING TO DECLINE OVER TIME AS. THE THE REQUIREMENT TO THE PURCHASE AND AND TRADE THESE. ALLOWANCES WILL IN FACT CHANGE OF BEHAVIOR AND THAT. CO TWO WOULD IN FACT DECLINE OVER TIME AND THAT. BUT ULTIMATELY. CAP AND TRADE SHOULD FULFILL ITS IT'S. EXPECTATIONS ON ESSENTIALLY AT SOMEPLACE GO AWAY. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF YOU'RE ASKING. PRIVATE INVESTMENT PEOPLE THE UNDERWRITERS. TO TAKE A SIGNIFICANT RISK WITH THAT KIND OF FINANCING. WHEN THERE IS A. THIRTY YEAR BOND REQUIREMENT. WITH A FLATTENING OR DECLINING. STREAM OF REVENUE TO PAY PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. THAT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME. TO BE A. STREAM OF REVENUE THAT CANNOT BE COUNTED ON OVER TIME. WOULD YOU CONCUR WITH THAT IS THAT A RISK FACTOR IN THIS KIND OF FINANCING. CROSS BROWN WITH THE LA EL ASSEMBLYMAN A MEMBER PATTERSON CERTAINLY THERE IS. QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND FUTURE CAP AND TRADE REVENUES WE'VE DONE SOME LOOKS OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY BUT CERTAINLY IF YOU'RE EVEN LOOKING BEYOND THAT THERE'S EVEN GREATER UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THAT REVENUE STREAM WOULD LOOK LIKE. I THINK ARGUE AT LEAST IN THE MEDIUM TERM IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR ON THE LONG TERM BUT IN THE MEDIUM TERM THERE A COUPLE DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT COULD. AFFECT THE REVENUE SOME OF THEM HAVE SORT OF A. DOWNWARD PUSH ON THE MATTER REVENUE AS YOU MENTIONED THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES PERHAPS THAT ARE SOLD IS DECREASING. THAT'S OFFSET AND TO SOME EXTENT IT MAY BE EVEN MORE THAN OFFSET BY POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE PRICES OF THOSE ALLOWANCES. SO LEAST THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY YOU CAN SORT OF SEE WHERE THOSE MIGHT. BALANCE EACH OTHER OUT AND SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT A DECLINE IN REVENUE STREAM. BUT YOUR POINT ABOUT BUT I BUT ALSO IT IS IT. WOULDN'T IT BE TRUE THAT ANY EXTENSION OF CAP AND TRADE WILL HAVE TO REACH THE TWO THIRDS VOTE THRESHOLD NOT MERELY A MAJORITY VOTE. BUT I'M NOT SURE WE COULD SORT SAY WITH ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CERTAINTY I THINK AT THE VERY LEAST F. AN EXTENSION WERE APPROVED WITH A MAJORITY VOTE THAT WOULD BE A LOT OF LEGAL UNCERTAINTY AROUND. YET THE ABILITY TO DO THAT IN THE PROGRAM AND SO YOUNG AND THAT CREATES POTENTIAL PROBLEMS FOR TRYING TO FINANCE BASED ON THAT. SO YOUNG THAT I THINK THAT'S A LEGAL QUESTION THERE WHERE THERE'S NOT HER PRESENT UNCERTAINTY BUT CERTAINLY TWO THIRDS VOTE WOULD. PROVIDE A LOT MORE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE FUTURE PROGRAM AND AGAIN I'M I'M I'M BASICALLY LOOKING AT THIS. THROUGH THE VIABILITY OF A FINANCE PLAN THAT HAS THESE KINDS OF UNCERTAINTIES. AND THOSE KINDS OF UNCERTAINTIES INVESTORS GOING TO KNOW ABOUT AND THE RATING AGENCIES ARE GOING TO KNOW ABOUT THIS AND YOU YOU JUST CAN'T HIDE THIS KIND OF UNCERTAINTY. AND SO I DO THINK IT'S A RATHER DUBIOUS APPROACH. TO THE BIG PICTURE FINANCE AND AND AND I THINK. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED HERE. THAT SOONER OR LATER THIS LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO DECIDE WHETHER IT'S GOING TO FULLY FUND THIS OR WHETHER IT IS NOT. AND THAT I BELIEVE IS GOING TO REQUIRE A A A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE WE COMMITTED TO CERTAIN THINGS AND CERTAIN. TIMELINE CERTAIN SPEED CERTAIN COSTS. BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO REALLY. A. PUT MONEY WHERE ARE OUR OUR MOUTH IS IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE. SERIOUS ACTION BY THE THE BUT AT AND THE AND THE PEOPLE STATE CALIFORNIA GOING HAVE TO WEIGH IN ON THAT DAY. THEY WERE THEY VOTED ON THIS INITIALLY. AND I THINK IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE. HUGE AND CAN AT AND AND AND DEEP CHANGES IN HOW IT'S FINANCED. A AND THE RISK FACTORS INVOLVED IN IT IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE THE SAME KIND OF TRANSPARENCY OPEN THE SCHOOL TO THE DISCUSSION DEBATE AND I THINK A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE. ANOTHER WHICH I THINK WE SHOULD LEADERSHIP OUGHT TO REALLY RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS IN A SERIOUS SERIOUS PLACE. AND THAT. ASKING THE VOTERS. AGAIN. WE'RE NOT BUILDING WHAT WE WE SAID WE WERE GOING TO BILL IT ISN'T GOING TO. PRODUCE THE SPEEDS THE TIME. THE COSTS ARE. VERY EXCESSIVE AND HERE'S HOW WE'RE GOING HAVE TO FUND I THINK WE OWE TO THE PEOPLE TO ASK THEM AGAIN. UNDER THESE. WITH THESE COSTS SHOULDN'T WE ASK THE PERMISSION A AT THE BALLOT BOX IF WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE A HUGE SIGNIFICANT DATA. COMMITMENT OF GENERAL FUND MONEY OR OR A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND MONEY FOR FOR THESE PURPOSES. MISSION THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER PASS AND THEY ASK FOR A CLARIFICATION FROM YOU MISTER PATTERSON. DID YOU INDICATE THAT THERE'S A WRITTEN OPINION FROM. THE. LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S. APPARENTLY NOT. IT'S IT AT. THE OPINION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO US INFORMALLY. AND WE'RE ASKING THAT IT BE. FORMALIZED. BUT. I WOULD SUGGEST THIS. ASK. ARE. ASK OUR LEGAL COUNSEL ABOUT AT DON'T THEY'LL GIVE YOU THE SAME ANSWER THAT THEY TO US. I WILL BE SURE TO DO THAT. UPON. I OPTED. I THINK IF WE JUST WERE I I GUESS MY MY FOCUS I GUESS IS TO TRY TO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US OPERATE ON THE SAME INFORMATION. SO I'M HEARING THAT THAT THE GAP IN THE FUNDING GAP HAS GROWN OVER OVER TIME WHAT IS THE CURRENT FUNDING GAP. IF IF. TO TALK TO THE LA HOW COULD ANSWER THAT. HOW MUCH MONEY DO WE HAVE NOW AND HOW MUCH MONEY DO WE NEED? YET SO. OUR LOOK AT THE. PRESENTLY AVAILABLE REVENUE SUGGESTED THE AUTHORITY MIGHT HAVE SOMEONE WORTH OF TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY IF YOU IF YOU INCLUDE CAPTURED REVENUES AT THEIR. DESTINATION ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY. THIRD POINT THIRTY AT. TO FUND CONSTRUCTION OF INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT AS YOU SEE THE BUSINESS PLAN THE EXPECTED CAPITAL COST OF CONSTRUCTION IS SOMEWHERE CLOSER TO THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS. SO I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH A FUNDING GAP OF. ROUGHLY EIGHT BILLION PETER I DON'T I GET YOU WE HAVE TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS. RIGHT NOW OF THE TWO TO TWENTY THIRTY IDENTIFIED IDENTIFY RESOURCES THAT WILL COME TO THE AUTHORITY. OKAY BUT THE CURRENT THE TOTAL PROJECT COST SEVENTY SEVEN TO NINETY EIGHT BILLION THAT'S REALLY WHOLE FEES ONE CORRECT PHASE ONE ALRIGHT SO THEY HAVE TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS NOW. RIGHT AND THE WHOLE COSTS IS ANY SEVEN TO NINETY EIGHT BILLION. SO THE SO THE DELTA IS LARGER. THAT EIGHT BILLION IT'S. THE SIX IF I AM FIFTY SIX BILLION TO. SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION. YES I WAS AFRAID TO TALK PRETTY SEGMENT NOTHING. SO THE SO THE INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT JUST TO GET IT DONE IS EIGHT BILLION. BUT DON'T TO FINISH THE WHOLE THING IT'S FIFTY SIX TO SEVEN SEVEN DIED THAT'S RIGHT IS MISTER KELLY INDICATED THAT'S ROUGHLY THE IDENTIFY POSSIBLE TO TAKE A PASS. TOTALING SEGMENT AND SO YEAH BUT IT WOULD TAKE A PASS AS THAT ABOUT MONEY HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED. THAT'S MISSING. SO WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT. DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE PROJECT A PASSING A COST. THERE IT CENTER COST ESTIMATES ARE SOMEWHERE IN THAT BALLPARK AROUND A BILLION BUT I DEFERRED VIEW FORTY TO GIVE YOU A BETTER NUMBER. OF. SO. SO IF I WAS GONNA IF IF. TO THE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. WE NEED SAID THAT THE SIX OR SEVEN SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO FINISH THIS WHOLE PROJECT. WHAT WITH WITH UNDERSTANDING STIPULATING THAT THE AT THE AUTHORITY HAS IDENTIFIED TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS? THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT. AND THEN IN. TO TO MISTER THOMPSON YOU YOU YOU SPOKE TO SOMETHING THAT PART BY. I GUESS THAT I DIDN'T ADDED KNOW THIS BUT YOU MENTIONED BEFORE THAT IN THE PREVIOUS BUSINESS PLAN THERE WAS THAT. THERE WAS IDENTIFICATION OF A SALES TAX OR TAX ON FUELS. TO FINISH THIS PROJECT CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT THE TWO THOUSAND DISMISS PLAN FIRST ONE ó WAS TO BE FINANCED WITH THE SALES TAX. I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS EVER MENTIONED A SALES TAX ON FUELS AND MANY OF THE BUSINESS PLAN OKAY BUT YOU YOU YOU IDENTIFIED AS A POTENTIAL LONG TERM REVENUE STREAM. AMONG A LOT OF OTHERS OKAY. WELL IT RIGHT FEDERAL FEDERAL FUNDS TO MEET. IN TERMS OF. I GUESS IF IF IF THE GAP IS. IF THE DELTA IS FIFTY SIX SENATOR BILLION. AND THERE'S NO COMPLETE FUNDING PLAN NOW. AS YOU INDICATED IN ON PAGE EIGHT OF YOUR ANALYSIS. THEN IT. THEN HOW SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE PERSON. AND AND ASSESSING THIS PROJECT. BUT THE QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE DECIDED THERE MANY OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU IS THERE ALWAYS HAVE BEEN AS. YOUR THOUGHTS NEGATED. BAD FOR THE ONES THAT SPRING TO MIND INCLUDE GOING INTO THE PROJECT. BUT TRICKING THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT PURSUING THAT. PROJECT AS IDENTIFIED IN THE DRAFT EIGHTEEN PLANNER FUNNY WAY TO COMMIT SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO COMPLETED THROUGH TO THE END OF PHASE ONE AND. A VARIETY OF OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE IN THAT RESPECT AS WELL INCLUDING ADDITIONAL DEDICATED TAXATION REVENUES. EXPAND OUTREACH ALLOCATION TO THE PROJECTS ADDITIONAL BONDING AUTHORITY WERE ALLOCATING GENERAL FUND MONIES TO TO PROJECT OKAY BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT THE AS OUTLINED IN THE JEFF THIS IS PLANNED. AS I IF I'M UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY EVEN BONDING AGAINST UNCERTAIN A CAP AND TRADE REVENUE STREAM THAT. EVENT JACK CREATES EVEN MORE UNCERTAINTY RIGHT EVER IF IF IF WARY BUT IF WE ARE FORCED TO LOOK AT THE DRAFT IS HIS PLAN. IF IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING CORRECT IS THAT IS THAT THE CREDIT THE CORRECT ASSESSMENT. I'M NOT QUITE SURE SURE. I I MEAN I THINK CERTAINLY THERE THERE'S NO AS AS WE DISCUSS THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND FUTURE CAP AND TRADE REVENUES. THEIR POTENTIAL WAYS TO STRUCTURE IT WHERE PERHAPS THERE'S A LITTLE BIT LESS UNCERTAINTY FOR THE PIECE THAT WOULD MAYBE GOT HIGH SPEED RAIL FOR EXAMPLE RATHER THAN THE. PERCENTAGES A FIXED AMOUNT THOSE TYPES OF THINGS BUT. YET CAP AND TRADE IS IS ANYA AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW IS IS UNCERTAIN. FORMA REVENUE. IN. AND IN TERMS OF THE. THE LOOKED A BUSINESS PLAN AND IF I LOOK AT THE FOUR OPTIONS. BUT OUTLINED BY THAT PEER REVIEW RIGHT NOW WE'RE ON A PATH. TO CREATE TWO SEGMENTS THAT DON'T CONNECT AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE IT'S OF THE BECAUSE A FUND OF THE FUNDING GAP IS THAT CORRECT. YES. AND AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE SPEEDS BECAUSE OF THE BLENDED SYSTEM. THERE ARE CERTAIN PORT PARTS PORTIONS OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM THAT WON'T BE AS HIGH SPEED. CORRECT. THE CURRENT PLANS WOULD BE EXPAND IN AFFECTED CALTRAIN SYSTEM TO GILROY THAT SECTION FROM SAN JOSE TO GILROY WOULD BE OPERATED AT A HUNDRED AND TEN MILES AN HOUR. SOME HIGHER SPEED YES OKAY THANK YOU. KALRA MISTER MON QUESTIONS. MR MILLER. A GOOD OKAY. WELL THERE'S NO FURTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY I THINK. IT WAS SEPARATE YOU GIRLIE INSIGHTFUL A TO HEAR PREMIUM MISTER THOMPSON REGARDING CA. HOW WE FRAME THE ISSUE GOING FORWARD AND I'M GONNA GIVE SOME THOUGHT TO? THAT QUESTION OF WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE NOT SO MUCH WHAT MY ANSWER IS BUT HOW. THAT WE AS THE OF THOSE WHO HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER THIS PROJECT SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE PROJECT AND. AT IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT LOOKING MORE CLOSELY AT HOW WE DEVELOP THE SOURCE OF FUNDING. AND THE I THINK THE OTHER A BIG POINT YOU MADE IS THE TO. CLARIFICATION OF THE FUTURE. OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND HOW THAT'S GONNA OF GOING TO WORK IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE. DISCUSSING WILL BE HAVING A CHANGED ADMINISTRATION. AS PART OF OUR A. A DEMOCRACY IN THE IN THE COMING MONTHS AND IT'S I THINK A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO. A GIVEN THAT CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP AT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. AND THE CHANGES THAT WE'VE SEEN A SADLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN TERMS OF WILLINGNESS TO FUND THE PROJECT AT LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM I'M. HOPEFUL AS MR MULLIN MENTIONED THAT WILL BE ABLE TO TURN THAT AROUND IN RELATIVELY SHORT ORDER. BUT TARA OF FOR THE TIME BEING I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO THIS ALONE AS A. AS A STATE AND TAKE STOCK OF. OF THE VARIOUS RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. AND TRIED A FIND THE RIGHT WAY TO. TO MOVE FORWARD SO THANK YOU FOR FOR FRAMING THOSE ISSUES AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE UNHAPPY DOESN'T RESPOND THE LEGISLATION THAT CREATED US AS YOUR ADVISORS. OF WHAT MAY INVITE ANY OF YOU IF WE CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION OR ADVICE OR SIT DOWN AND DEBATE HERE. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO DO SO. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT WE WILL. I THANK YOU. A TO THE LA GOES WELL FOR HER A. VERY INSIGHTFUL COMMENTS. WE WILL MOVE ON TO OUR THIRD PANEL NOW AND THEN WE'LL TAKE A PUBLIC COMMENT ON. OR ON THE ON THAT DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN. AND I THINK ISSUE NUMBER TO. BUT WILL WELCOME US HASAN A CROWD OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE FAN. OF. OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS AND SEAMUS MURPHY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF. WELCOME. SCREWED UP. OF. I MISSTATED YOUR POSITION I APOLOGIZE. IT WILL CORRECT THE RECORD POOREST. WELL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO BIXEL YOU INTO THE SEISMIC FOR INVITING US TO SHARE LOCAL PERSPECTIVE ON THE DRAFT HIGH SPEED RAIL BUSINESS PLAN ON SEAMUS MURPHY CHIEF COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER FOR THE CALTRAIN COMMUTER RAIL SYSTEM YOU DON'T WANT THE PROMOTION YEAH NOT YET. ASSEMBLY OUT WE MIGHTILY UPSET IF. CALTRAIN APPLAUDS THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY ON THE RELEASE OF THEIR DRAFT TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. PARTNERSHIP INSIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT FROM THE AUTHORITY CALTRANS BEEN ABLE TO PROCEED WITH EFFORTS TO ELECTRIFY THE CALTRAIN CORRIDOR BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN JOSE. AND THAT SECURE THE INVESTMENT NEEDED TO REPLACE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE SYSTEMS DIESEL FLEET WITH HIGH PERFORMANCE ELECTRIC TRAINS. I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THAT WE HAD ARE PART OF THAT HAVE IT WE HAD OUR PROJECT GROUNDBREAKING IN JULY TWENTY SEVENTEEN. CONSTRUCTION HAS BEEN ON GOING FOR MONTHS IN THE FIRST POLLS HAVE BEEN INSTALLED ALONG THE CORRIDOR. HIGH PERFORMANCE ELECTRIC TRAINS THAT ARE BEING MANUFACTURED IN SALT LAKE CITY ARE EXPECTED TO BEGIN SERVING OUR WRITERS AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE DRAFT TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN PROPOSES NEW STRATEGIES THAT WOULD EXPAND ELECTRIFICATION OF THE CALTRAIN COURT OR SOUTH OF SAN JOSE TO GILROY. ENSURING THAT ALL COMMUNITIES CURRENTLY SERVED BY CALTRAIN WILL BENEFIT FROM THE ADVANTAGES OFFERED BY ELECTRIC TRAINS INCLUDING INCREASED SERVICE FREQUENCY REDUCE TRAVEL TIMES ENHANCE RELIABILITY. AND IMPROVE AIR QUALITY. THIS NEW APPROACH WHICH IS PART OF THE PHASED IMPLEMENTATION OF A SILICON VALLEY TO CENTRAL VALLEY LINE IS A CONTINUATION AND AN ENHANCEMENT OF THE AUTHORITIES LONG STANDING COMMITMENT. TO EVENTUALLY CONNECT THE STATE WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE IN A WAY THAT ALL ALSO OFFERS IMMEDIATE BENEFITS IN IMPROVEMENTS TO EXISTING REGIONAL RAIL SERVICES INCLUDING CALTRAIN. THE APPROACH ALSO FOCUSES ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EARLY INTERIM HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND GILROY AS EARLY AS TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. THE ADDITION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE TO THE CALTRAIN CORRIDOR HAS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR MAXIMIZING THE BENEFITS OF CORRIDOR ELECTRIFICATION. AND FOR PROVIDING COMMUNITIES ALONG THE CORRIDOR WITH NEW MOBILITY OPTIONS THAT WILL BE A VALUABLE PART OF OUR EFFORTS AS A REGION TO ADDRESS GROWING TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND MAINTAIN OUR ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS. CALTRAIN IS CURRENTLY LEADING EFFORTS TO DEVELOP THE CALTRAIN BUSINESS PLAN WHICH INCLUDES AN IN DEPTH TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF THE ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF SERVICES WITHIN THE CORRIDOR. INCLUDING THE ADDITION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL OF MANY OF THESE ISSUES WILL SPEAK TO THE. GOOD NEED AS MISTER THOMPSON SUGGESTED THE NEED FOR AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE RAIL OPERATORS ON THE BOOKENDS AND THE AUTHORITY. MOVING FORWARD TO ADD THAT SPEAK TO THE OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM ON THOSE SHARE FACILITIES. CALTRAIN LOOKS FORWARD TO CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT FROM THE AUTHORITY AND OUR LOCAL AND REGIONAL STAKEHOLDERS TO COMPLETE THE CALTRAIN BUSINESS PLAN AND TO BETTER DEFINE STRATEGIES FOR ENHANCE CONNECTIONS. BETWEEN OUR COMMUNITIES ON THE CORRIDOR AND FOR EVENTUAL% CONNECTION OF OUR REGION TO THE REST OF THE STATE. CALTRAIN ALSO LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORITY IN OUR PARTNERS IN SAN FRANCISCO TO ENSURE THAT CALTRAIN AND HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE OR EXTENDED DOWNTOWN TO SAN FRANCISCO'S TRANSPAY TRANSIT CENTER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THE EXTENSION OF HIGH QUALITY RAIL SERVICE TO THE TRANSLATE TRANSIT CENTER HOLDS DRAMATIC POTENTIAL FOR THE EXPANSION OF CALTRAIN SERVICE TO NEW MARKETS AND WILL HELP FACILITATE CONGESTION RELIEF AND ENHANCE MOBILITY THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COURT OR. SIMILARLY WERE EXCITED TO BE WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE AUTHORITIES THE CITY OF SAN JOSE AND SANTA CLARA VALLEY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY TO ENVISION A NEW DEAR IT ON STATION A PROJECT THAT WILL CREATE REGIONAL. AND STATEWIDE CONNECTIVITY ENHANCEMENTS AND TRANSFORM THE SOUTHERN TERMINAL OF OUR RAILROAD. THANK YOU I'D BE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CRADDICK WELCOME AT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON ON THIS AND OTHER ISSUES THAT IMPACT CALIFORNIA GOOD GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I I CAME HERE TO YOU TODAY TO PRESENTING SOMETHING CALIFORNIA NINETEEN MILLION PEOPLE HOW FOR THE STATE. OF CALIFORNIA AND THE. TO OFFICIALS THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS AND SANK THE HIGH SPEED THEIR LAST WEEK YOU FOR MAKING. AND ASSIGNING ANIMAL YOU'LL. WOULD THE CCAC BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE. THAT THE MORE YOU. PRETTY MUCH SAID WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN THE EXISTING SYSTEMS ON THE HIGH SPEED THEY'LL COME. NOW WE ARE READY. AND I'M VERY PLEASED TODAY THAT THE DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN INCLUDED. HALF A BILLION DOLLARS. FROM HIGH SPEED RAIL. PROP A FUNDS. TO FUND AND. ROSS CON MONKEYS. AND UNION STATION. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO'VE BEEN TO UNION A STATION IT'S GETTING VERY BUSY PLACE. WE HAVE THE NORTH EAST SCATTERED THAT WHICH IS THE SECOND BUSIEST IN THE COUNTRY THAT COMES FROM SANTIAGO AND LOUIS HUNT WAS OBISPO. THIS IMPROVEMENT WOULD. SAVE A LOT OF TIME FOR PEOPLE COMING INTO UNION STATION. BUT ALSO IN A REMINDER THAT THE FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS COMING KING THE STATION. IS GONNA BE MATCHED BY MORE THAN THAT. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PROJECT WELL OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S GONNA COME SO THAT'S SIGNIFICANT. I ALSO WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT. OUR COMMITMENT AND I WOULD WORK WITH WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL IS ABOUT IMPROVING THE SYSTEM AND GETTING SOME BENEFITS RIGHT AWAY AND CREATING JOBS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TIGHTLY. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY ON THAT REMAINING HALF A BILLION DOLLARS. ALL OF PROJECT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. GRANTED IT'S BEEN AWHILE SINCE WE SIGNED THEM WE'LL WE'RE VERY PLEASED THAT WE FINALLY AND AND I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER BROWN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP FINALLY GETTING TO THAT'S WHAT WE SEE. AND SHOW THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE PRESENTED THAT WE ARE INVESTING. IN THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA. I ALSO. ONE ANY MIND YOU THAT I'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS FOR THIRTY YEARS. AND. I AM I'M A JUNKED PROFESSOR TEACHING YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT PLANNING AND TRANSPORTATION. AND I REVIEW WITH THEM HISTORICALLY THAT AND THERE WERE NOT ONE SINGLE. MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT THAT WAS EASY. OR THAT CAME UNDER COST. OR UNDER BUDGET. OR HAD THE LENDING OF THE BANK AYE ID MIND YOU WILL. TEACH OUR KIDS IN THE FUNDING SCHOOL ABOVE THE BAR TO EXPERIENCE WHEN PEOPLE WHAT I NEED YOU AND OR OR THE WHATEVER PROJECT OR LAND TO THE STATE SYSTEM EVEN. SO BIG PROJECTS TAKE TIME AND TAKE MONEY. I BELIEVE THE IMPROVEMENT WE'RE DOING SO WITH THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING AND IN UNION STATION ANOTHER AGGRESSIVE SOFTEN CALIFORNIA I'M GONNA BE BENEFICIAL. REGARDLESS OF HOW LONG AND WIN THIS PROJECT WILL WILL TAKE HOLD. BUT ALSO REMIND YOU IF WHO WANT TO PROVIDE CHOICES FOR CALIFORNIANS. WE HAVE TO INVEST THOSE CHOICES. AND GOD KNOWS WE DO I NEED TO MAKE CHOICES. I MEAN I EIGHT. MISTER KELLY MENTION. ECONOMIC BENEFITS BUT THERE IS ALL KIND OF BENEFITS ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMIC. WE NEED INFRASTRUCTURE BIG INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. LAST YEAR I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT IN CHINA AND TAKE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL FROM SHANGHAI TO VISION. I THINK AVERAGE SPEED TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY KILOMETERS PER HOUR. I AS AN AMERICAN AS CALIFORNIAN WE SAY WHY NOT US WHY NOT PROVIDE OPTIONS. AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE HIGH SPEED DETAILS THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND I HOPE. YOU MAKE THE MONEY AVAILABLE FOR US TO TO START. WORKING ON THIS PROJECT THANK GOODNESS. THANK YOU FOR A FEW YEARS AGO I WROTE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL FROM AS SHANGHAI TO BEIJING ALSO AND ASK MYSELF THE SAME QUESTION. I THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU SIR FOR MY DEMONSTRATING THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT THE THIS AND MANY PRIZES BUT IN THIS ONE PARTICULAR THAT IT'S NOT A STATE PROJECT. THAT REALLY IT'S IT'S REALLY ABOUT. REGIONS AND CITIES AND COMMUNITIES. AND I THINK ARTICULATED IT WELL THAT WE HAVE TO THINK MORE THAN JUST A IT'S NOT JUST A TRAINS AT REBUILDING. RIGHT AND I THINK AND SHAME AS YOU KNOW AS ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU. APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT WE DID TOGETHER BY ONE THOUSAND CALTRAIN BOARD THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK. IN IN TERMS THAT WHAT WHAT CALTRAIN HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO IN PARTNERING WITH HIGHSPEED RAIL THIS SOUNDS LIKE A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING AND SO. MONEY IS BEING INVESTED IS BEING INVESTED IN. NOT SYSTEMS LIKE CALTRAIN THAT ARE KNOWN SYSTEMS. THAT THAT ARE CRITICALLY VITAL FOR OF FOR MOVING PEOPLE CERTAINLY IN THE BAY AREA. I THINK THAT. THE WILL YOU BE WHEN YOU LOOK AT. THE TRAFFIC CONGESTION THAT'S INCREASED IN THE BAY AREA THAT I COULDN'T IMAGINE IT WOULD BE LIKE IF THERE IF CALTRAIN WAS IN THERE. AYE TAKING. WHO LITERALLY MILLIONS OF AND VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED COME OFF OF ONE ON ONE AND TWO EIGHTY? AND SO YOU KNOW I I I APPRECIATE THE LOCAL PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE MANY OF US COME. FROM LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ACQUITTED ON STATION IS MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT I AM VERY EXCITED AT THE OPPORTUNITY. MAGISTERS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REALLY BY THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE ULTIMATELY CAN'T KEEP ON BILL BUILDING LANES ARE FREEWAYS IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE IT'S NOT SMART IS NOT GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IS NOT GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY. AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO PARTNER. CERTAINLY BUT OUR LOCAL JURISDICTION CALTRAIN AN MBTA AND OTHERS. AS WELL AS OUR PARTNERS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE BECAUSE WE NEED TO. YOUR REGIONAL LEADERSHIP BUT WE ALSO NEED YOUR INPUT AS TO WHAT KIND OF POSITIVE IMPACTS OF THAT DON'T ALWAYS MAKE IN THE HEADLINES THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS AS PROVOCATIVE. BUT THEY'RE. EQUALLY IF NOT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT TENDS TO MAKE IT MY HEADLINES AND AND THAT'S THE REAL WORLD REAL TIME VALUE. THAT WE'RE SEEING I'M THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT AND THESE REGIONAL PROJECTS THAT ARE PARTNERING WITH AND BENEFITING FROM. OF THAT INVESTMENT SO THINK ABOUT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BOTH OF YOU OF THE SHIP PRESENTATIONS. THAT WAS AN INFORMATION ONLY. ITEM. WE. ARE GOING TO. I HEAR ISSUE NUMBER WELL WHAT WE TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE ONE. AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS KEITH ON HER BEHALF DISSOCIATION CAO FREE HIGH SPEED TRAINS WHAT'S BEEN SAID ABOUT THIS PROJECT AND HOW WE'RE MOVING FOR A GUESS I WOULD JUST LIKE TO. ADD OF A BRIEF COMMENT. ABOUT THAT THE NATURE OF BUILDING THESE MASSIVE. INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE CALIFORNIA IN THE UNITED STATES THE FACT IS THAT WE DON'T. UP COME INTO THESE PROJECTS WITH ALL THE FUNDING THE FACT IS IS THAT THE FUNDING IS LEVERAGE FUNDING IS PIECED TOGETHER AND THIS IS NOT UNIQUE WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL THE SAME APPROACH IS TAKEN AND I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY PROFESSIONAL WORK ON ROADS TRANSIT AND DAMS. THROUGHOUT OUR STATE IN THE NATION THE FACT IS THAT THE MONEY IS NEVER ALL THERE WHEN YOU START THESE PROJECTS I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO WALK AWAY THINKING THAT YOU GO IN WITH A BIG BAG F. FUNDING THAT YOU'VE ALL PUT TOGETHER AND THEN YOU GO OUT YOU DON'T PROJECT THE REALITY IS IS THAT. THERE'S COMPETITION NOT ONLY WITHIN ARE STATE FOR THE FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT BUT NATIONALLY. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO COMPETE AND COMPETE VERY WELL BECAUSE THIS IS AN INNOVATIVE PROJECT THAT'S NOT ONLY GOING TO CHANGE HOW WE DELIVER OUR. OUR ARC CITIZENS TO THEIR JOBS AND HOMES BUT ALSO HOW WE IMPACT OUR ENVIRONMENT IT'S GOING TO HELP ENHANCE OUR POLICY GOALS THAT WE'VE ALL. BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THROUGHOUT THE SAY THE THING THAT MENTION THREE GUARDS TO AIRPORTS. IS. WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE AND VERY AWARE OF THAT ECONOMIC BENEFIT THAT THAT ARE MANY MILITARY BASES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PROVIDER CITIZENS. THE FACT IS THAT THEY HAVE DEDICATED AIR SPACE WITHIN OUR STATE THE PUTS RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY FOR IN FLIGHT IN STATE FLIGHTS SOONER SOME. BUILT OUT IN OUR AIR SPACE SO NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A BUILT OUT IN OUR HIGHWAYS SYSTEMS AND ROADWAYS WITH. BUSINESSES AND HOMES BUT OUR AIR IS DEDICATED TO MILITARY FACILITIES WHO BRING GREAT ECONOMIC ENGINES TO THE STATE. AND EMPLOY THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS AND PROVIDE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO OUR STATE SO. HIGH SPEED RAIL IS NOT ONLY THE BEST ALTERNATIVE BUT REALLY THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE THAT WE HAVE. WITHIN CALIFORNIA TO MOVE RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES AND. AND AND MOVE OUR ECONOMY AND SAY WITHOUT IMPACTING THESE THESE INDUSTRIES THAT WERE NOT OF US WANT TO SEE LEAVE THAT PROVIDE A CRITICAL. ECONOMIC BOOST TO CONTINUE TO HEAR IN OUR STATE A CALIFORNIA SUCH THANKS VERY MUCH FOR TIME. I THINK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE JEREMY SMITH THEY ARE BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER REALLY SAID ALL I WOULD LIKE TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH ALL HIS COMMENTS IN JUST. AT AGAIN FOR THE RECORD THAT. THERE ARE YOU KNOW. DESTRUCTION WORKERS WORKING BECAUSE OF THIS PROJECT IN AREAS THE STATE THAT THEY WEREN'T WORKING IN BEFORE AND THOSE JOBS. IN THIS PROJECT HAVE LEAD TO OTHER INDUSTRIES BEING A OR THE OTHER BUSINESSES BEING CREATED AND EMPLOYING. OTHER PEOPLE THIS THIS IS HAPPENING IT IT'S NEEDS TO HAPPEN WE NEED A THIRD. HOW OPTION FOR TRANSPORTATION THE STATE? TO ADD TO THE HIGHWAY SYSTEM AND THE. STATE OF THAT THAT THE STATE REPORT SYSTEM BUT THE THE AIRPORTS WE HAPPINESS IN THE STATE WE NEED HIGH SPEED RAIL TO MOVE FORWARD AND BE PREPARED FOR THE INFLUX OF PEOPLE ON THE STATE AND TWENTY FIFTY RECALL WHAT HAD TOWARDS FIFTY MILLION. SO I LIKE TO THINK OF THE CEO FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND OF BEING VERY TRANSPARENT AND THAT'S THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY. HIS TRANSPARENCY THE AUTHORITIES TRANSPARENCY OVER THE LAST DECADE. IS UNPARALLELED IN MY OPINION I'VE BEEN. DO AND DOING THIS FOR FIFTEEN YEARS NOW AND I CAN'T THINK OF A SINGLE THING. A SINGLE PROJECT THAT HAS BEEN. COME ASK BUT ASKED TO COME BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE. AND IT HAD TO COME OVER THE LEGISLATURE TO THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES AND BUSINESS TRANSPARENT THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN.

OKAY GOOD MORNING I'M LAURIE BERMAN I'M THE BRAND NEW CALTRANS DIRECTOR. AND. BEFORE WE START WITH THE FIRST ITEM I WANT TO JUST GIVE A VERY QUICK I RECOGNIZE HER BUT HE'S BEEN SITTING FOR AWHILE AND JUST GIVE IT VERY QUICKLY OVER THE OTHER. OF SP ONE. AYE ROADWAYS AND BRIDGES ARE IN IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DISREPAIR DUE TO TRAFFIC WEATHER AND PROLONGED NEGLECT. FUNDING FOR CALIFORNIA'S ROADS AND BRIDGES COMES FROM FEDERAL HIGHWAY TRUST FUND IN THE STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT. PRIOR TO S. B. ONE CALIFORNIA'S FUEL TAXES HAD LOST ABOUT HALF OF THE BUYING POWER DUE TO INFLATION. CONTRIBUTING TO THE BACKLOG OF REPAIR WORK THAT WE NOW FACE. WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB ONE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING WAS INFUSED WITH FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT DECADE. EVENLY SPLIT BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES ESSENTIALLY DOUBLING THE AVAILABLE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING FOR OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF SB ONE CALTRANS HAS BEGUN THE DESIGN ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE OF OVER TWO HUNDRED PROJECTS. WE'VE AWARDED OR BEGUN CONSTRUCTION ON ALMOST SEVENTY PROJECTS WE HAVEN'T XCELERATED MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED. FIX IT FIRST PROJECTS INCLUDING THE NINETY MAJOR FIX IT FIRST TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS NEARLY TWELVE HUNDRED LANE MILES OF PAVEMENT REPAIR AND OVER SIXTY BRIDGES. TO ENSURE TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENT DECISIONS ARE BASED ON QUALITY INFORMATION AND WELL DEFINED OBJECTIVES CALTRANS DEVELOPED A TRANSPORTATION ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN WHICH IS A STRATEGIC PLAN. FOR MANAGING ASSETS TO AN AGREED SERVICE AGREED STANDARD OF SERVICE FOR MAINTENANCE AND DELIVERY AND LAST MONTH THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY FEDERAL HIGHWAYS APPROVE THIS THIS WAS THE FIRST. TRANSPORTATION ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN APPROVED IN THE COUNTRY. INFORMS THE PREPARATION OF THE TENURE PERFORMANCE TARGETS SUPPORTING LONG RANGE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND THAT ULTIMATELY. LEADS TO THE DEVELOPMENT LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND CTC ADOPTION OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN SHOP AT THE LAST COMMISSION MEETING. BASED ON TENURE PERFORMANCE GOALS OVER THE OVER THE NEXT DECADE CALTRANS IS COMMITTED TO FIXING MORE THAN SEVENTEEN THOUSAND. LANE MILES OF PAVEMENT FIVE HUNDRED BRIDGES FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND COLOR CULVERTS AND SEVENTY SEVEN HUNDRED TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS RAMP METERS. TRAFFIC CAMERAS AND ELECTRONIC HIGHWAY MESSAGE BOARDS. A TWENTY EIGHTEEN SHOP CONSISTS OF OVER A THOUSAND PROJECTS TOTALING NEARLY EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS WHICH INCLUDES SIX POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING PROVIDED BY SP ONE. AND I WANTED ALSO TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ON. THE THE THINGS THAT S. B. ONE REQUIRES WHICH ISN'T TO ENSURE THE CALTRANS IS OPERATING IN AN OPEN AND TRANSPARENT MANNER WE HAVE LAUNCHED A PROGRAM. WEBSITE REBUILDING CALIFORNIA. BUT THAT PROVIDES GENERAL INFORMATION AND IDENTIFY STATE LOCAL SP ONE PROJECTS AND A LOT OF OTHER DETAILS BUT MORE THAN THAT S. B. ONE REQUIRED. THE HIRING OF A NEW INDEPENDENT INSPECTOR GENERAL WHO WILL PROVIDE INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT TO THIS PROGRAM AND THE CDC HAS ALSO TAKEN ON AN ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT ROLE. SO MOVING ON TO THE ROAD REPAIRS ACCOUNTABILITY IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION REQUESTS ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE SUPPORT. AND CAPITAL FUNDING AND FOUR HUNDRED NEW MAINTENANCE POSITIONS FOR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS UNDER SP ONE. FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN S. B. ONE REVENUES AND LOWERING LOAN REPAYMENTS PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY. FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS FOR LOCAL AND STATE TRANSPORTATION PRIORITIES. THIS REQUEST SEEKS TO CONTINUE IMPLEMENTATION CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATION. THANK YOU I BELIEVE ELLIOT HAS SOME COMMENTS. YEAH PUDDLE THIS KEY WITH THE LA SO. UNDER SB ONE A LOT OF THE FUNDING IS ALLOCATED PURSUANT TO FORMULAS TO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS ON BUT THERE'S ONE. THREE OF PART OF OF FUNDING THAT SUBJECT TO THE BUDGET ACT AND THAT'S HOW YOU ALLOCATE FUNDING BETWEEN. THE HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROGRAM AND THAT THE SHOP PROGRAM THE SHOP PROGRAM PERFORMS. A MORE EXTENSIVE REHABILITATION WORK ON HIGHWAYS. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN HE ALLOCATES A SOMEWHAT MORE FUNDING TO SHOP VERSUS THE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM. AND WE THINK THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER MODIFYING. THE PROPOSAL TO WAIT THE ALLOCATION IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. BOTH PROGRAMS HAVE LARGE BACK LOTS OF PROJECT IN FUNDING SHORTFALLS. BUT THERE'S THREE REASONS WHY WE THINK THE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM. MIGHT MERIT MORE FUNDING AND THOSE ARE FIRST. MAINTENANCE CAN SAVE SIGNIFICANT MONEY IN THE LONG RUN THROUGH PREVENTION. CALTRANS ESTIMATES FOR EACH DOLLAR OF MAINTENANCE WORK SAVES BETWEEN FOUR AND TWELVE DOLLARS BY POSTPONING SHOT PROJECTS. AND SECOND AS I MENTIONED THE. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE FUNDING SHORTFALL FOR MAINTENANCE A SOMEWHAT LARGER THAN FOR SHOP. AND LASTLY MENTIONS PROJECTS DON'T REQUIRE AS MUCH DESIGN AND ENGINEERING WORK AND SO THEY COULD BE COMPLETED MORE QUICKLY IF YOU WANT TO SEE. RESULTS FROM SB ONE FASTER. THANK YOU A ADDRESS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. COMMENTS. NOT IN THIS TIME TO. THANK YOU OF MS BERMAN DO YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO COMMENTS ABOUT THE SPLIT BETWEEN THE SHOP AS A. MAINTENANCE FUNDING. SO WE NEED TO DO BOTH WE NEED TO SPEND MONEY ON THE SHOP AND ON THE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM AS I MENTIONED. WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT GUIDES ARE INVESTMENT IN THE IN THE PROGRAM. AND AFTER YEARS OF UNDERFUNDING A LOT OF THE HIGHWAY SYSTEM HAS DETERIORATED BEYOND THE POINT THAT THE MAINTENANCE PROP UP PROJECTS WILL. ARE A VIABLE OPTION SO WE LOOK AT EACH SEGMENT THE NEEDS REPAIRS WE LOOK AT WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE TO CONTINUE TO DO A SHORTER TERM MAINTENANCE FIX. OR THE BIGGER SHOP OF THE PROJECT AND AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE LONG TERM. NEGLECT OF THE SYSTEM THAT WE WE START WITH THE THAT WE FEEL THAT WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE MIX OF SHOPPING MAINTENANCE DOLLARS. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. PUBLIC COMMENT. IT WAS FUN I'M SORRY. THAT'S RIGHT UP I WANT TO WELCOME A NEW CATCH AS DIRECTOR LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU. I JUST WHAT JUST A QUICK QUESTION. AND MAYBE IT MAYBE IT'S THAT THE THAT WENT WITH THAT YOU COULD ANSWER ME WITH ELIO AS MORE FOR MISSION BUT. DO YOU HAVE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE SKETCHES OF AN ASSESSMENT ON THE IMPACT OF. OF LONG TERM OF IN THE COVERS EXECUTIVE ORDER IN THE PUSH FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES. THE OF WAS A FIVE MILLION TO BUY TWENTY FORTY ON THE IMPACT ON A GAS TAX REVENUE AND OUR INABILITY TO TO ADDRESS ROAD NEEDS. IS. YOU'RE ASKING IF WE'VE ESTIMATED THE AFFECT OF AN INCREASE IN ELECTRICAL GAUGE YET IS A. WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT ANALYSIS RECENTLY I DON'T KNOW IF THE ADMINISTRATION HAS THE PART OF FINANCE DOES YES. SO BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX THE GAS EXCISE TAXES ARE ESTIMATED TO BRING IN ABOUT EIGHT POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. AND AYE INTHAT YEAR AND OF THAT NOT BE THREE BILLION WILL BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO SP ONE. RIGHT ACROSS THIS UGLY AT THE AS THAT INFRASTRUCTURE INITIATIVE WOULD DISPLACE A SMALL AMOUNT OF THAT REVENUE BY REDUCING THE CONSUMPTION KATHLEEN THAT WOULD HAVE REDUCED THAT BY ABOUT FORTY MILLION HOWEVER. BECAUSE THE THERE IS A THAT THE THAT IS PART OF THAT BE ONE. THAT WOULD INCREASE FROM OUR INITIAL ESTIMATE OF THIRTY MILLION TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION SO THE TOTAL REDUCTION WOULD BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. AND THAT WE ABOUT THREE PERCENT OF THAT DEEPLY THREE BILLION TOTAL. SO IT TOO OKAY SO A REDUCTION TO IN A FIFTY MILLION THAT'S ASSUMING FIVE MILLION LECTURE VEHICLES OR THEY DID TO THE THE MEETING OF THE AS A DESERVE EXECUTIVE ORDER. AT ITS CORE. THAT'S THAT'S ASSUMING OF THAT REACHING THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION GOAL BY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. CLIVE I MIGHT BY TWELVE AS IS NOT ONE THAT I'VE MILLION DOLLAR GOALS OUT BEYOND THE ESTIMATES THAT WE HAVE FOR OUR OUR OUR TEN YEAR ESTIMATES ON THE SP ONE BUCKET SO SO THAT THAT IS THAT. THAT AS A. ANALYSIS IS ASSUMING ONE POINT FIVE MILLION SETS THAT'S ASSUMING THAT THE ADOPTION OF ONE POINT FIVE BILLION MILLION ZEPP VEHICLES BY THE TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX TARGET. TWENTY FIVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NOAH IS ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. ITEM. ALRIGHT. IS BERMAN A OF STICKING AROUND FOR THE NEXT ISSUE YES SAM GREAT POSTERS ROLL RIGHT INTO IT. THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION ACROSS A PERMANENT INCREASE OF FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WILL FIX A BUDGET SHORTFALL CREATED DURING THE CONVERSION TO FISCAL. AND PASSED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION ADJUSTMENTS THIS PICKS WILL FULLY FUND BENEFIT RETIREMENT COSTS FOR EXISTING POSITIONS PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED BY THE LEGISLATURE. BECAUSE OF THE SHORTFALL CALTRANS HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO COMPLETELY FILL ALL OF OUR AUTHORIZED POSITIONS. POSTFIX WILL ALLOW CALTRANS TO FILL POSITIONS HELD VACANT DUE TO THE FUNDING SHORTAGE DOING SO WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO FOCUS ON AREAS OF LAGGING PERFORMANCE. AND PROVIDE BETTER SERVICE TO THE STATE INTO THE PUBLIC AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAN ADDRESS ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. I APOLOGIZE DESTRUCTIVE. DID YOU COMPLETE IT COMMENT ON. ILIO. SIR AS YOU HEARD THE PROPOSAL IS TO APPROVE FIFTY EIGHT MILLION TO FILL VACANT POSITIONS. THIS FUNDING WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE FOR HIGHWAY CAPITAL PROJECTS SO THAT'S. THE MAIN TRADE OFF HERE IN TERMS OF APPROVING THE PROPOSAL. THE PROPOSAL DESCRIBED SORT OF AT A HIGH LEVEL OF WEAR THE VACANCIES WERE BUT IT DIDN'T PROVIDE SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON THE SPECIFIC WORKLOAD THAT HASN'T BEEN PERFORMED DUE TO THE VACANCIES. WE THINK THAT THAT INFORMATION WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR YOU TO CONSIDER. AND DECIDING TO PROVE THE PROPOSAL SO WE'D. RECOMMEND YOU REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE MORE DETAIL BEFORE TAKING ACTION ON THIS ONE. WITH BERMAN WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION. SO WE WERE PLANNING TO DO WITH THAT IS. HAVE MORE MAINTENANCE EMPLOYEES MORE BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO DO THE MAINTENANCE WORK THAT WE DISCUSSED IN THE LAST ITEMS SUCH AS FIXING POTHOLES INCREASING CRAP REPAIRS. EXEN. DAMAGE GUARDRAIL AT SUCH A. REDUCING THE TIME IT TAKES TO HIRE NEW EMPLOYEES. SPEED UP. WELL INCREASE THE HEALTH OF THE TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ELEMENTS THESE ELEMENTS IS CONGESTION AND ALERT THE TRAVELING PUBLIC TWO UPCOMING ROAD CONDITIONS. OUR GOAL IS TO BE AT NINETY PERCENT IN GOOD CONDITION BY TWENTY TWENTY WERE CURRENTLY ABOUT SEVENTY TWO PERCENT. AND THERE'S DEPARTMENT FIND ITSELF COMMENTS YESTERDAY REALLY IS AN ECLECTIC TO IDENTIFY MYSELF THIS IS THE NEWMAN NOW I'M GONNA FINANCE I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY UM'S IN THE ALLEYS THAT ELLIOTT SAID A MOMENT AGO THAT WAS. YES THIS IS FUNDING TO FILL POSITIONS OF THIS IS FUNDING TO A COMPLETE THE FUNDING OF EXISTING POSITIONS HAVE WITHIN CALTRANS YOU CAN PULL THE MIKE TO YOU IF YOU WANT BUT NO A LOT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AT THEIR. THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS. ALRIGHT I THINK HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN ALSO AND TO. MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE. OKAY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION REQUEST THE EXTENSION OF FIVE LIMITED TERM POSITIONS AND THREE POINT TWO MILLION TO UTILIZE A WORD TO GRANT FUNDS. AND CONTINUE TO EXPLORE MORE EFFICIENT EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING ALTERNATIVES. FEDERAL HIGHWAYS APPROVED A ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR GRANT IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN FOR CALTRANS TO DEMONSTRATE MECHANISMS TO COLLECT MILEAGE BASED REVENUE IN DATA IT FUELING STATIONS. THE THREE POINT TWO MILLION INCLUDES TWO AND A HALF MILLION ONE TIME COSTS FOR CONSULTANT SERVICES. HELLO. SO THE THE PROPOSAL IS TO CONTINUE A OF WHAT'S CALLED THE ROAD USAGE CHARTS STUDY TO EXAMINE OUR OKAY. A METHOD OF COLLECTION COLLECTING THE REVENUE FOR THE CHARGE. AT THE GAS PUMP. AT THE TIME WE'VE REVIEWED THIS PROPOSAL CALTRANS IS STILL ASSURING AN RFI. TO ASSESS THE COSTS THAT WE WOULDN'T REALLY HAVE COMPLETE INFORMATION TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION ON AT. HOME BUT IF THEY. COULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IF THEY KNOW ARM IN MORE DETAIL NOW THAT THEY'VE DONE OUR IF I THE COST AND WE. WOULD HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. SURE IF THE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OF THE RFA WAS RELEASED ON JANUARY EIGHTH AND CONCLUDED ON FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH. WE RECEIVED EXCUSE ME ELEVEN RESPONSES AND ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ASSESSING EACH RESPONSE. THE RESPONSES SPAN A WIDE RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT POINT OF SALE SYSTEMS AND. DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY THEIR SPONSORS CONTINUE TO BE EVALUATED IN THE RESULTS OF THE ARE BY WILL BE REPORTED BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. TELETYPE RAN ON THE. JERRY SNAPPING A TENTATIVE TIMELINE NUMBER ARE FIVE REVIEW. IT'S A JUNE THIRTIETH WHO NEEDS. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT FINANCE. NOTHING THAT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. WE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION HOLD ITS OPEN AS WELL. AND TO MISTER MALONE HAS QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WERE. THOSE FIVE METHODS THAT WERE ALREADY TESTED. SO WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THAT EVALUATION OF THOSE FIVE MATHIS IS THAT AN ONGOING. EVALUATION HAS THAT WRAPPED UP ITS KIND OF WHAT'S WHAT'S THE. STATUS THERE. SO THE THE ORIGINAL ROAD CHARGE PILOT. PROGRAM FINAL REPORT WAS RELEASED ON DECEMBER SEVENTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THE CTC PER. CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION PROVIDED THE RECLAMATION RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THEIR TWENTY SEVENTEEN ANNUAL REPORT. SO THIS WILL BUILD ON THE INFORMATION WE GATHERED IN THAT THAT FIRST. SO THAT REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED THAT. WHILE SOME OF THE THE EFFICACY OF THOSE FIVE METHODS THAT WERE WERE TESTED SO OKAY IT DETRACT AT PORT GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WILL MOVE ON TO. ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. OKAY. THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION REQUESTS OF ONE TIME INCREASE OF UP TO TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT FUNDS TO DEVELOP. AN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP THIS ROADMAP WILL PROVIDE THE GUIDANCE FOR SUSTAINABLE AND ADAPTABLE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ENVIRONMENT. CONTINGENT UPON THE COMPLETION OF AN APPROVAL FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CALIFORNIA STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY AND CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE WOULD ALLOW CALTRANS TO REQUEST A ONE TIME INCREASE OF TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF EQUIPMENT THAT HAS REACHED ITS END OF LIFE. THANK YOU ALEJO. REGARDING THIS PROPOSAL LAST YEAR YOU THELEGISLATURE APPROVED. TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO BEGIN REPLACING ITS IT DEVICES I'M NOT THAT TIME. THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE WORKING ON A MORE COMPLETE PLAN FOR TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE REPLACING THE DEVICES AS COST EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. I MEAN THEY'RE GONNA START WITH THE AUGMENTATION FROM WASHER JUST REPLACING BLUNTS AT GREATEST RISK OF FAILURE. THEY THEY WERE ABLE TO COMPLETE THAT PLAN WHICH IS WHY THE REQUESTING THAT TWO MILLION DOLLARS THEY DETERMINED THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO HIRE. CONSULTANTS TO HELP THEM WITH IT. AND AS YOU HEARD THEY WANT A COMPLETE THE PLAN IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. BUT IN ADDITION I ALSO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO START SPENDING MONEY TO IMPLEMENT IT. WE THINK THAT'S A LITTLE PREMATURE WE THINK THAT THEY SHOULD DO THE PLAN IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FIRST SO WE THINK THEY SHOULD APPROVE THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT. AND THEN HAVE THEM COME BACK NEXT YEAR TO REQUEST FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEN LOSE BERMAN. I AVAIL THINK OF HILLARY INTRODUCED MYSELF TO ASSIST THE WEALTH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. LAST YEAR YOU THAT THE DEPARTMENT IDENTIFIED. OVER SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF EQUIPMENT THAT IS PASSED IT'S FAR PAST IT'S IT'S A TIME TO BE REPLACED. AND. IN DOING SO LAST YEAR WE PUT TOGETHER THE. ONE FIFTH OF A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST FOR THE EQUIPMENT THAT HAD THE HIGHEST CRITICALITY. AND. THE THE MOST OF THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE PROBLEMS NOT BE REPLACED. HOWEVER THAT STILL LEAVES YOU KNOW CLOSE TO FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN EQUIPMENT THAT IS YOU KNOW THAT HAS BEEN ALREADY IDENTIFIED. THE DEPARTMENT DID CREATE A PLAN. UP PLAN FOR HARDWARE. REPLACEMENT. AND IN THE PROCESS OF REPLACING THAT PLAN. YOU KNOW IT IS PART OF REVIEW THAT PLAN WE WE WANTED TO THEN EXTEND. THE IDEA OF LOOKING AT. IT'S SORT OF A SYSTEM WIDE SO IT'S NOT JUST A HARDWARE REPLACEMENT PLAN BUT A PLAN FOR HOW WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE I. T.. SYSTEM TO WHAT'S GOING TO BE STORED IN THE CLOUD WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS HOW DOES THIS. HOW DID THESE HARDWARE REPLACEMENT? PLANS PALACES HEART REPLACEMENT PLAN FIT IN WITH THE OVERALL IT PLANTS SO. THIS TWO MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR HERE IS ESSENTIALLY TO LOOK AT THAT PLAN IT'S A IT'S A PROGRESSION FROM THE PLAN THOSE RD PUT TOGETHER REGARDING THE HARDWARE. IT'S OUR PROPOSAL IS TO IT NOT UNTIL THAT PLANET DEFIES TO ENSURE THAT THIS THE HARDWARE THAT WE HAVE THAT WE WANT TO REPLACE. IS. IS PART OF THE FUTURE PLANS OVERALL SO THE WE'RE NOT REPLACING THINGS THAT WE'RE THEN GOING TO TURN TURN AROUND AND. USE A DIFFERENT METHODOLOGY OR USE A DIFFERENT. TYPE OF. IF IT IT UP PLAN. AND WE WILL NOT. CONTINUE WITH THE REPLACEMENT OF ANY ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT UNTIL THAT PLANET TO IS IS IDENTIFIED SO THAT'S WHY WE WANTED TO HAVE. OF UPON IDENTIFICATION OF THAT THE ABILITY TO STILL REPLACE THE TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE HARDWARE BECAUSE. WE'VE IDENTIFIED FAR GREATER THAN THAT THAT'S GOING TO MEET DE TO REPLACE. AND ANY DELAY JUST. THE STATE AT RISK ON THIS IT'S ON A FAILURE ON MY TEETH. ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT OR HAS BERMAN AND. I HAD A FEELING THAT THE PUBLIC HAVE. ALRIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AS RECOMMENDED AND. THAT TAKE THAT'S ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. WE'RE BACK TO HIGH SPEED RAIL IN REIMBURSABLE LOOKED OR HE.

THIS REQUEST CONSISTS OF TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION FOR PERSONAL SERVICES OPERATING EXPENSES IN LITIGATION COSTS WILL PROVIDE ONGOING LEGAL SERVICES TO CUT.

OTHER NOT PARTICULARLY RELEVANT TO DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES ON BUT AS A ALEJO HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THIS ITEM. WELL JUST NOTE THAT THAT STARTUP HE WITH THE LA O. WILL JUST KNOW THAT THE NBA IS CURRENTLY BOUNCE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROJECTIONS INDICATE A REASONABLE RESERVE THROUGH THE. FORECAST WINDOW BUT IT'S WORTH BEARING IN MIND THAT ADDITIONAL COST PRESSURES COULD ARISE IN THE FUTURE. AND LEGISLATURE MIGHT WISH TO REPAIR THESE MIGHT THAT MAKES DECISIONS REGARDING THE ACCOUNT. SOME IS COST PRESSURES INCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE COSTS GROWING ABSENT A PLANNED ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THOSE. THE PENDING RENEGOTIATION OF CHP OFFICER SALARIES AND BENEFITS THOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION DOES MAKE AN ASSUMPTION FOR THOSE AND IN THEIR PROJECTIONS. UNTIL THOSE NEGOTIATIONS ARE COMPLETE THERE'S ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE MIGHT CHANGE. AND. OF COURSE THE POSSIBILITY THAT NEW CEDAR FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS COULD EMERGE UP WITH ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON ON THE NBA. THANK YOU AND I SHOULD POINT OUT ON ALL THREE OF OUR.

IT'S OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY SO I WOULD LIKE TO START THEIR. IN ADDITION TO THE COMMUNICATIONS RELATED CAPITAL OUTLAY PROPOSALS THAT ON VOTE ONLY. WE HAVE SIX PROPOSALS RELATED TO REPLACEMENT OF OUR FIELD OFFICES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND THREE FIELD OFFICE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PATROL FUNCTIONS. AND IN FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE ADMINISTRATORS ADMINISTRATION INITIATED PLANTER PLAYS MOST OF THOSE OUTDATED OFFICES. MOST OF ITS FACILITIES ARE DECADE SO THEY'RE UNDER SIZE AND UNABLE TO MEET OUR CURRENT OPERATIONAL NEEDS. THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE ALSO UNABLE TO MEET SEISMIC SAFETY CRITERIA FOR ESSENTIAL SERVICES BUILDINGS. SELECT RENT THE ROOM. RIGHT NOW VERSES ARE SANTA FE SPRINGS OFFICE. AND AND FOR ONE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS AND PERFORMANCE CRITERIA PHASE. BALLING PARK IS THAT ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ALSO IN THE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA PHASE. THE OTHER FOUR FACILITIES ARE THE QUINCY AREA OFFICE FOR THIRTY SIX POINT NINE MILLION AND IN THE DESIGN BILL PHASE. EL CENTRO FOR FORTY POINT THREE MILLION. AS THAT'S ALSO DESIGNED BILL PHASE. AND THEN THE HAYWARD EVERY OFFICE FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S IN THE DIVINE BILL PHASE. AND WHAT WE WILL DO ONCE THAT OFFICE IS COMPLETED WE WILL TAKE OUR PERSONNEL THE CASTRO VALLEY OFFICE. AND CONSOLIDATE THEM MOVIMENTO TO THE. HEBERT OFFICE. AND IN THE LAST OFFICES DECEMBER MEDINA OFFICE FOR FORTY POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS ALSO ON THE DOT DESIGN PAYS. OUR PROPOSAL FOR THE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR SANTA FE SPRINGS IMBABA PARK. REPLACEMENT PROJECTS. WOULD BE FUNDED THROUGH THE NBA. OUR PROPOSAL FOR THE DESIGN BILL PHASE FOR QUINCY EL CENTRO SAN BERNARDINO. AND HE WORKED INCLUDES A SHIFT IN FUNDING FROM THE NBA NBA TO THE PUBLIC BUILDINGS CONSTRUCTED FUND. WHICH ARE LEASE REVENUE BONDS. AND WE DIVERT YOUR APARTMENT PARTNERS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS FUNDING STRUCTURE. AND IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY MYSELF AND. ASSISTANT CHIEF AT RICH DESMOND WILL HEAR ANSWERS QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. SAYING NO QUESTIONS OF WHO ARE LIKE IN OUT HERE THIS MORNING BUT YEAH I WILL ASK THE LA OF THE LA WHO HAS THE COMMENTS HE SHOT MIGHT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WHO'S. LIKE IN AT THAT THAT THE CHANGE FROM THE PAYS YOU GO APPROACH TO A FUNDING AREA OFFICE REPLACEMENT WHICH WAS THE APPROACH THAT THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION TOOK LAST YEAR. TO LEASE REVENUE BOND FUNDING FOR AREA OFFICE REPLACEMENTS I AM. KAMALA JUST GENERALLY SLOW DOWN THE PACE OF THE REPLACEMENTS WOULD ALLOW THE PROJECTS TO CONTINUE AND. IMPROVE THE CONDITION OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT. ON. HOWEVER IT WOULD LOCK IN FUTURE MOTORVEHICLE ACCOUNT COSTS. DEPARTMENT FINANCE. YEAH. READY BECAUSE THE PART OF FINANCE. AND I THINK WE WERE JUST MOVED OUT OF SOME OF WHAT THE LA OF SAYS THAT. IT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE THE. THE ALTERNATE WOULD BE. THAT WE'D HAVE TO BASICALLY PAUSE MOST OF ASSOCIATES FEES PROJECTS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. ON A NET PRESENT VALUE THE STRAP AND IT WOULD BE. THAT ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN PAY GOES TO PAY GOES WOULD BE PREFERRED. BUT THE COST OF A MULTI YEAR DELAY WOULD ALSO. INCREASE THE PROJECT BY TWENTY PERCENT OR SO. WE ALSO NOTE THAT THESE REVENUE AND THAT SHOULD BE A COMMON MECHANISM FOR FINANCING CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS IT'S USED. TO. BY DOZENS OF OF DEPARTMENT STATEWIDE. WE WOULD ALSO DEFERRED THE UTILITY OF OF THOSE IMPROVEMENTS A BY HOWEVER MUCH LIGHTER WEIGHT EXACTLY THAT THE REASON WHY. THE OLD OFFICERS NEED TO BE REPLACED. RIGHT. OKAY WELL THANK YOU. I IS ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. WELCOME MISTER REED. PORTANTINO. GOD DON'T THINK THAT YOU HAVE SIX MINUTES. MEMBERS WHO GUARANTEED REPRESENT A CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS. OF WANTED TO COMMENT ON THE OF FUND CONDITION THAT WAS PART OF YOUR CONVERSATION WITH THE AND THE A IT IS PARIS FLEA. LOW A EVEN IF THEY DO BOND FINANCING. THE BALANCE THE IN YOUR ANALYSIS WHICH IS VERY WELL WRITTEN AND RESEARCHED. A SHOWS HITS LIKE THREE HUNDRED MILLION AND CHANGE. A AND IF THEY DO THE BOND FINANCING THAT THAT LEVEL STAYS BUT IF THEY DON'T THEN IT'S LIKE HUNDRED AND FORTY. MILLION OUT OF. THAT HOW MANY BILLION IS A TOTAL OF THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION. I CAN'T DO THE PERCENTAGESIN MY HEAD BUT IT'S A PRETTY LOW PERCENTAGE TO HAVE AS A. BUFFER. ALL BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SO MANY EMERGENCIES THAT REQUIRE THE CHP TO EXPEND FUNDS THAT THEY DIDN'T ANTICIPATE SUCH AS THE BIG FIRES. IN NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE VENTURA FIRE THIS THOMAS FIRE THE TUBS FIRED ALL THE OTHERS SO THERE'S THERE'S COSTS THAT THEY CAN ANTICIPATE. SO WE WE KNOW THAT THE FUND CONDITION IS IS SHAKING. AND WHO YOU KNOW FINANCES TRYING TO. PATCHES AS BEST THEY CAN WITH THIS IDEA REVENUE BONDS BUT I'M NOT SURE IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO. FINANCE BECAUSE AND YOU HAVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION OF OF FINANCING COSTS THAT YOU HAVE TO BEAR SO ONE WHERE ANOTHER REPAYING. BUT IN THE LONG RUN IF YOU FINANCE YOUR PAYING MORE. A SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT COMMENT A URINALYSIS ALSO POINTS OUT SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN DONE WHERE A I KNOW DMV SELLS INFORMATION TO INSURANCE COMPANIES ON DRIVERS RECORDS. AND THAT MONEY IS NOT PROTECTED BY ARTICLE NINETEEN SO THERE'S EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS THIS COLLECTED BUT THOSE MONIES ARE SENT TO THE GENERAL FUND. AND THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT IT'S A POSSIBILITY TO CONSIDER KEEPING THAT IN THE NBA CAO INSTEAD OF SENDING OUT IT'S ONLY BEEN TRANSFERRED OUT. A ACCORDING THE ANALYSIS SINCE TWENTY TWELVE A A COURSE WE HAD SOME SERIOUS BUDGET OF PROBLEMS BACK IN THOSE YEARS SO MY CONSIDER RETAINING. THAT EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION THAT LEGITIMATELY IN THE NBA BUT IT'S NOT PROTECTED BY ARTICLE NINETEEN BECAUSE IT WAS A SALE OF INFORMATION RATHER THAN. A REGISTRATION FEES. SO I POINT THAT OUT. THE LAST THING I WOULD MENTION IT IN I SENT AS WELL AS THE PRESIDENT HE ASSOCIATION SENT A LETTER FOR FUTURE HEARING IS SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT. A THE STAFFING OF THE HIGH WITHDRAW I'VE BEEN REPRESENTING FORTY YEARS. AND STAFFING HAS BEEN AN ISSUE PRETTY MUCH FOR ALL FORTY OF THOSE YEARS. AND THEY DON'T COMPLAIN AND THEY TELL ME OKAY IN ORDER DON'T RAISE IT WILL JUST KEEP DOING THE BEST WE CAN WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT. AND THAT'S HOW THEY ARE PRETTY SSUE FLARED UP AGAIN THIS YEAR AT A BOARD MEETING COMMISSIONER STANLEY WAS HERE AND HE HAD TO DEAL WITH. A PRETTY HOSTILE QUESTIONS ABOUT STAFFING IS SO LOW. AND IN IN THE LETTER POINT OUT THAT IT'LL INCREASE WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB ONE. A BECAUSE THERE'S MORE CONSTRUCTION OF PROJECTS AND THEY PRESIDE PER PROVIDE THAT PROTECTION IN CONSTRUCTION ZONES AND WILL SCRATCH THE STAFF EVEN FURTHER. BUT. THEIR STAFF IS LOW WITHOUT SP ONE IF YOU TAKE THAT OUT THERE STILL VERY VERY LOW IN WE HAVE CHARTS IT WILL SHOW THE NUMBER OF OFFICERS PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND LICENSED DRIVERS. PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND REGISTERED VEHICLES AND MAYBE MORE IMPORTANTLY. PER MILLION MILES OF VEHICLE TRAVEL WE CALL VMT VEHICLE MILES OF TRAVEL. AND THE RATIO OF OFFICERS DAHLE THOSE WORKLOAD INDEXES HAS GONE DOWN. A WE WRITER. STRONG GUESS STRENGTH WHEN REAGAN WAS GOVERNOR SO FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS WE'VE STEADILY GONE DOWN.
