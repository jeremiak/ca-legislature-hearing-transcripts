HAPPEN TO REPRESENT A FORMER

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:18.691
LIFE THE AREA THAT ABUTTED THE

HOMES AROUND THERE AND I

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:23.496
CREATED SOME DEFENSIBLE SPACE.

00:09:23.562 --> 00:09:26.065
PROTOCOLS ARE NOT ONLY FOR THE

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:28.200
PRIVATE- HOMEOWNER BUT ALSO

SOMETHING LIKE THIS BE

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:50.623
APPLICABLE TO PUBLICLY. I THINK

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:51.991
THROUGH THE INSPECTION PROCESS

00:09:52.058 --> 00:09:54.560
YOU PROBABLY START TO GET TO

00:09:54.627 --> 00:09:56.028
THE TENSION POINTS IN A

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:57.863
PARTICULAR COMMUNITY SO YEAH

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.532
THE PRIVATE LANDOWNER GOES DOWN

00:09:59.598 --> 00:10:02.301
THE HILLSIDE CUTS OFTEN THAT IT

00:10:02.368 --> 00:10:04.770
FILTERS INTO PARKER BLM OR

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:07.006
CONSERVANCY RIGHT. IN THEORY I

00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:09.041

THOSE ARE ATTENTION POINTS.

00:10:10.609 --> 00:10:12.912
THIS BILL ISN'T ABOUT THE MONEY

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:15.948
PART OF IT- BUT THE FACT IS

00:10:16.015 --> 00:10:18.184
THAT WHAT WOULD. HE INJURED

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.287
ABILITY TO REALLY GO AFTER THE

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:23.389
PUBLIC LAND SIDE AS THE IN M.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:27.560
BUDGET. FOR A PARKS CONSERVANCY

00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:28.828
I THINK WE CAN GET THROUGH THE

00:10:28.894 --> 00:10:29.996
RIGHT WHATEVER REGULATORY

00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:32.298
ANXIETY THERE MIGHT BE SAY LIKE

00:10:32.365 --> 00:10:34.700
ME WHEN WE WERE IN MALIBU YOU

00:10:34.767 --> 00:10:35.234
HAVE SOME ENVIRONMENTALLY

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:38.304
SENSITIVE HABITAT THAT WERE IN

00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:42.608
THE MIDDLE OF TRYING TO PREVENT

00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:43.242
A MUD SLIDE AND YOU NEED TO PUT

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:44.443

YOU IF YOU'RE TALKING LIKE LIFE

00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:50.049
AND DEATH. FOR THAT KIND OF

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:50.649
DEFENSIBLE SPACE A MAINTENANCE

00:10:50.716 --> 00:10:54.387
BUT- WE'VE GOT TO SOLVE THE

00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:56.555
RESOURCE QUESTION I THINK AT

00:10:56.622 --> 00:10:59.358
THE SAME TIME THAT WE GO FIND

00:10:59.425 --> 00:10:59.925

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:00.559
FIND IT PART. I'M NOT PROMISING

00:11:00.626 --> 00:11:04.263
THAT. CHALLENGE BUT I DO THINK

WE'LL FOR WILL FIND THOSE SPOTS

00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:08.067

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.005
APPROPRIATE AND I'D CERTAINLY

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:15.341
MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE THIS

00:11:15.408 --> 00:11:18.878
FORWARD- IF THERE IS AN-

00:11:18.944 --> 00:11:19.512
FEDERATION WHERE THAT'S CALLED.

00:11:19.578 --> 00:11:21.247
A CONTEMPLATED. I THINK THERE

00:11:21.313 --> 00:11:23.049
NEED BE SOME CAN. OF THE

00:11:23.115 --> 00:11:26.118
CROSSOVER TERRITORY- BUT AS A

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:28.821
FIRST STEP FANTASTIC THANK YOU

00:11:28.888 --> 00:11:29.755
CENTER WHICH WAS ON THIS POINT

00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:30.823
I'VE GOT TWO OTHER SPEAKERS AT

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.492
WHAT ON THAT QUESTION I JUST

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:35.895
WANTED TO CLARIFY REGARDING THE

00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:40.933
ANSWER THE BILL SAYS THE. THE

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.368
TRAINING PROGRAM WOULD BE

00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:43.769
REQUIRED TO PREPARE INDIVIDUALS

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:46.105
TO CONDUCT DEFENSIBLE STATE

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:47.073
ASSESSMENTS IN STATE

00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:49.675
RESPONSIBILITY AREA. SO IT'S

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:51.243
NOT JUST ON PRIVATE PROPERTY IS

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.479
THAT CORRECT. CORRECT OKAY JUST

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:53.946
WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT

00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:58.984
INTERJECTION. I THINK OBVIOUSLY

00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:00.719
TO EMPOWER PEOPLE IS VERY

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:04.490
IMPORTANT DURING THESE

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.826
FEEL HELPLESS WHEN A FIRE COMES

00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:08.394
OR WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO

00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:11.764
ANTICIPATE FIRE SEASON SO I DO

00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:13.666
APPRECIATE THE CONCEPT OF THE

00:12:13.732 --> 00:12:17.036
BILL. I ALSO JUST WANTED TO.

00:12:17.103 --> 00:12:19.205
REITERATE THE OBSERVATION BY

00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:23.275
THE ANALYSES THAT. IT'S I THINK

00:12:23.342 --> 00:12:26.345
THE KEY TO THIS IS MAKING SURE

00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:28.614
THAT THE FRAMEWORK THAT IS

00:12:28.681 --> 00:12:31.784
ULTIMATELY DEVELOPED IS ONE

00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:34.720
THAT DOESN'T GIVE PEOPLE SOME

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:35.921
FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY. AND

00:12:35.988 --> 00:12:38.090
GIVE THEM FALSE BUT THEY

00:12:38.157 --> 00:12:39.959
EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERYTHING.

00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:41.160
AND TO IN THIS THOSE VIEWS ON

00:12:41.227 --> 00:12:42.761
WHAT. IS AND WHAT HAVE YOU BUT

00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:44.964
SHOWS GIVES PEOPLE ARE THE

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.299
INFORMATION IN THE OPPORTUNITY

00:12:47.366 --> 00:12:48.901
TO BE HELPFUL AND SO I THINK

00:12:48.968 --> 00:12:50.703
THERE'S OF THERE'S A FINE LINE

00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:53.772
TO THAT- BUT I DO THINK IT'S

00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:54.406
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE

00:12:54.473 --> 00:12:57.510
KNOW. WHAT STEPS ARE AVAILABLE

00:12:57.576 --> 00:12:59.645
I KNOW HAVING GONE THROUGH THE

00:12:59.712 --> 00:13:01.380
FIRES IN MY DISTRICT AND I KNOW

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:03.616
YOU'VE HAD A NUMBER IN YOURS

00:13:03.682 --> 00:13:04.650
WE'VE ALL I THINK PROBABLY

00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:06.218
THROUGHOUT THE STATE EXPERIENCE

00:13:06.285 --> 00:13:08.854
THESE- THAT THE- HAVING

00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:11.690
INFORMATION AND BEING EMPOWERED

00:13:11.757 --> 00:13:13.792
TO ACT. IS VERY VERY CRITICAL

00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:16.729
TO GET THROUGH THESE. DISASTERS

00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:19.165
AND ALSO BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR

00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:20.199
HOMES AND OUR FAMILIES WHICH IS

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:22.535
REALLY. THE ALMOST EXCLUSIVE

00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:24.136
CONSIDERATION WHEN SOMETHING

00:13:24.203 --> 00:13:25.771
LIKE THIS HAPPENS SO I WOULD

00:13:25.838 --> 00:13:29.608
CHOOSE- LIKE TO REITERATE. THE

00:13:29.675 --> 00:13:30.876
RECOMMENDATIONS ADDITIONAL

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:33.512
KILEY GUIDANCE AND TIMELINESS

00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:34.847

00:13:34.914 --> 00:13:37.650
THAT WE HAVE CLEAR METRICS AND

00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:40.119
WHAT IT IS YOU WANT TO EDUCATE

00:13:40.186 --> 00:13:41.820
PEOPLE TO KNOW AND TO. AND TO

00:13:41.887 --> 00:13:45.324
BE ABLE TO DO- AND TO BE ABLE

00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:48.727
TO BRING THAT BACK SO WE FIND

00:13:48.794 --> 00:13:49.361
OUT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S

00:13:49.428 --> 00:13:52.498

THERE'S IT'S A SERIES OF

00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:17.489
QUESTIONS I THINK THIS IS

00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:18.557
REALLY IMPORTANT. WE'RE GONNA

00:14:18.624 --> 00:14:20.659
