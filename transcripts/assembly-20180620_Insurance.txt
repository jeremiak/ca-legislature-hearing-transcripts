ONE REPUBLICAN ARRIVES. I THINK THOSE ARE THE RULES. AND WE'LL HEAR THE FIRST BILL FROM [inaudible] MISS ATKINS -- AS A SUBCOMMITTEE [inaudible] YEAH THERE WE GO [inaudible] GOV WORKOUT. YOU SPEAK. TO MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER HARPER WELCOME. WE WILL GET UNDERWAY -- DON'T QUITE HAVE A QUORUM YET SO WE ARE ACTING AS A SUB COMMITTEE THE FIRST BILL WE WILL HEAR IS FROM MISS ATKINS IT'S SB. TEN EIGHTY SIX WELCOME TO THE ASSEMBLY INSURANCE COMMITTEE. CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND I I REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR AYE COURTESY OF ALLOWING ME TO GO FIRST -- SP TEN EIGHTY SIX PERMANENTLY EXTENDS THE WINDOW OF TIME DURING WHICH FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER WHOSE DEATH. IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A SERIOUS JOB CAUSED ILLNESS. ARE ELIGIBLE TO COLLECT SURVIVOR DEATH BENEFITS. PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS CONSTANTLY FACE LIFE THREATENING SCENARIOS AS WE ALL KNOW. MANY WHICH INVOLVE EXPOSURE TO DANGEROUS CANCEROUS TOXINS. EXISTING LAW PROVIDES THE FAMILIES OF OFFICERS WHO DIED AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE. TO THOSE TOXINS ACCESS TO A MODEST DEATH BENEFIT. PART OF TWENTY FIFTEEN HOWEVER IF AN OFFICER DIED MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FORTY WEEKS AFTER A DIAGNOSIS. THEIR FAMILY BECAME INELIGIBLE FOR THESE BENEFITS. IN RECOGNITION OF MEDICAL ADVANCEMENTS IN THE ARBITRARY NATURE OF THE TWO HUNDRED FORTY WEEK CAP. GOVERNOR BROWN IN THE LEGISLATURE EXTENDED THE ELIGIBILITY PERIOD FOR THESE FAMILIES TO FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY WEEKS AND TWENTY FIFTEEN HOWEVER WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE ACTION THAT TIMELINE WILL REFER BACK. A TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY WEEKS ON JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY NINETEEN WE ARE AWAITING DATA FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION ABOUT THE FISCAL IMPACT OF THE EXTENSION. HAS HAD OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS. IN THE MEANTIME HOWEVER THE CALIFORNIA FIRE FOUNDATION HAS FOUND THAT ONLY TWO FIREFIGHTER FAMILIES. HAVE ACCESS THIS ADDITIONAL BENEFIT WE THEREFORE BELIEVE THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE BILL ARE MINIMAL WHAT THE BENEFIT TO THESE FAMILIES IS SIGNIFICANT. WHETHER A PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS LIFE IS LOST IN AN INSTANT ARE SLOWLY DUE TO A WORK RELATED TERMINAL ILLNESS. BOTH INSTANCES SHOULD BE HONORED AS THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE. IN THE NAME OF PUBLIC SERVICE. S. B. TEN EIGHTY SIX WILL INSURE THAT THESE OFFICERS GRIEVING FAMILIES ARE NOT DEPRIVED OF THE BENEFITS. THEY DESERVE DUE TO AN ARBITRARY AND UNFAIR TIMELINE. I ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND MISTER CHAIRMAN -- HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS CHRISTY VELMA LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. WELCOME CHRISTY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRISTY VELMA FRO OF ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS POLICE TO BE SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE. OF OUR AUTHOR STATED PERFECTLY I THINK I'VE JUST. REMIND YOU THAT THE STATUTE THAT ORIGINALLY AUTHORIZES EXTENDED TIMELINE HAD TWO DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS FROM THE FROM THE LAW THAT WAS IN EXISTENCE BEFORE THAT WITCHES. THIS EXTENDED TIME WHEN IS ONLY AVAILABLE. FOR FAMILIES WHO LOST A LOVED ONE WHO WAS DIAGNOSED WHILE THEY WERE IN ACTIVE SERVICE THAT IS NOT A LIMITATION FOR ALL OF THE INJURED WORKERS. AND IT ALSO ONLY APPLIES TWO THREE TYPES OF INJURIES CANCER TUBERCULOSIS AND BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS SO IN THIS RESPECT IT'S VERY NARROW WE THINK THAT. THE DATA THAT HAS BEEN COLLECTED HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE IMPACT IS THE MINIMUS BUT THE ES ARE AUTHOR STATED THE IMPACT ON THE FAMILY IS TREMENDOUS AND SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. ANY OTHER ANY OTHER TESTIMONY IF MARIA GARCIA ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL PEACE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS BENEFIT ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

I'VE GOT SOME OLD JOKES I CAN TELL JIM [inaudible] AT THAT [inaudible] YOU ARE. YOU MEAN THE NET. SO WHERE HAVE WE TRIED TO REACH MISTER LARA. COOL THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT I WILL WELCOME MR LARA. YOU HAVE A TWO BILLS TO PRESENT S. B.. THIRTY S. FIRST GO AHEAD PLEASE. WE ARE ASKING YOU KNOW I THE QUESTION HOW CAN WE WORK WITH INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE COMPANIES TO INCENTIVIZE INVESTMENTS IN OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. THE BILL'S INSPIRED BY A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES THAT I LEARNED ABOUT. WHAT WE WERE -- IN BONN GERMANY -- EXAMPLES IN MEXICO AND IN BARBADOS FOR WE SEE LOCAL BUSINESSES AND INSURANCE COMPANIES WORKING TOGETHER TO INVEST IN NATURAL. INFRASTRUCTURE IN CANCUN ARE REASSURED COMPANIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS HAVE PIONEERED INSURANCE POLICY FOR THE CORAL REEF. I IN THIS POLICY LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS NEAR CORAL REEF PAY INTO A COLLECTIVE INSURANCE PREMIUM THE REEF PROVIDES PROTECTION AGAINST STORM STORMS AND OTHER CATASTROPHES AS AND IF DESTRUCTION AND OF IF A DESTRUCTIVE STORM DAMAGE IS A CORE REEF THE SURE WILL PAY OUT THE FUNDS FOR THE RESTORATION. THIS ALLOWS -- FOR A DIFFERENT TYPE OF FUNDING MECHANISM THAT'S QUICK THAT DOESN'T IMPACT THE GENERAL FUND OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OR OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THIS TYPE OF APPROACH IS THOUGHT TO BE THE FIRST IN THE WORLD TO TIE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICE OF STORM PROTECTION TO MONETARY COST AND REWARDS. THIS IS LIKELY THE FIRST TIME AND SURE HAS ACTUALLY ALSO COVERED A NATURAL STRUCTURE IN BARBADOS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE USING MARKET MECHANISMS. TO INVEST IN THEIR MANGROVE SWAMPS AND CORAL REEFS. THESE INVESTMENTS IMPROVE STAR PROTECTION AND MITIGATE AGAINST FUTURE DAMAGE. IT IS SAID THAT AFTER EVERY MAJOR STORM IT IMPACTS OF THE BARBADOS GDP BY 4% SO THIS IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE FOR THEM. BUT AND WHAT IS ANALOGOUS TO US HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN LOOK AT NOT ONLY SEA LEVEL RISE BECOME A COVER WITH THE RESTORATION OF OUR WETLANDS. AND OF COURSE FOREST'S MANAGEMENT FOR A AND WE CAN USE INSURANCE INCENTIVES TO REWARD GOOD BEHAVIOR AND REDUCE EXPOSURE OF THE STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OR BUSINESS. TO CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED LOSSES THIS ACTUALLY ALSO GIVE THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR REINSURANCE COMPANIES AND SHOWS COMPANIES TO ACTUALLY BE PART AND WELCOME INTO THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT. AS OPPOSED TO CAN SIMPLY JUST YOU KNOW ATTACKING THAT THE INDUSTRY I THINK THIS THE GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO WORK TOGETHER AND CREATE SOME INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS. THAT ALLOW OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO BE PART OF OUR CLIMATE CHANGE EFFORTS IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. MR LAURA THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND MY RECOMMENDATION IS OF OF A SUPPORT -- ON THIS BILL -- YOU HAVE OTHER FOLKS WHO LIKE TO SPEAK IN. IN SUPPORT [inaudible] IT'S LIKE. THANK YOU THANK YOU GENERAL ARE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LOUIS BLUMBERG. AND THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE CHANGE PROGRAM FOR THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. WE ARE PLEASED TO BE THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND HERE TO BE HERE AND STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS A VERY SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD BILL THAT WOULD. CREATE A PROCESS THAT WILL GENERATE INFORMATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO IN SUPPORT AND EXPAND THE STATE'S GOAL OF PREPARING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE. THE STUDY GROUP TO BE CREATED BY THE BILL WOULD EVALUATE POTENTIAL FOR SURE INSURANCE TO UNDERWRITE NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION. TO INCREASE RESILIENCE AND REDUCE RISK TO PEOPLE AND BIT BUSINESSES AND PRIVATE PROPERTY -- A KEY A CONCEPT OF THIS OF THIS OF THE BILL AND AND THE HOPE EFFORT THAT WE'RE DOING IS THAT NATURE REDUCES THE RISK. IF YOU LOOK AT FIVE RISKS THAT CALIFORNIA FACES RIGHT NOW THEY'RE ALL A CURRENT RICH THAT ARE EXACERBATED BY CLIMATE CHANGE ONE ITS WILDFIRE. DROUGHT. FLOODING SHE LEVEL RISE AND IRVINE HIGH HEAT NATURE CAN BE PART OF THE SOLUTION SHED SET FOR ALL FIVE OF THOSE. THOSE RISKS AND FOR THIS BILL WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW WE COULD USE THE INSURANCE AGENCY AND INDUSTRY TO CREATE A NEW MARKET MECHANISM. TO REDUCE WHAT THESE THESE RISK THAT WE ALL FACE AND A GREAT EXAMPLE IS THE COASTAL WETLANDS THAT CENTER LARA DID AN EXCELLENT ELOQUENT JOB OF DESCRIBING. OUR SCIENCE SHOWS THAT A CORAL REEF A IN PLACE CAN REDUCE THE WAVE ENERGY BY 97%. SO THIS THAT NATURE IS A POWERFUL TOOL IN ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE -- THIS BILL IS ALSO WELL ALIGNED WITH THE PRIORITIES OF THE LEGISLATURE AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TO OTHER OTHER BILLS. ARE A S. B. -- THREE SEVENTY NINE SP TWO FORTY SIX I ENJOYED IT AT AND ADDS TO THE STATE'S POLICY PLATFORM FOR DEALING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE WE'D LIKE TO THANK SENATOR LARA FOR HIS INITIATIVE IN HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. ARE AND RESPECTFULLY ARCHER AYE VOTE [inaudible] THERE. THERE'S A MOTION AND SECOND HANK YOU SIR FOR YOUR COMMENTS SIR. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS CATHERINE PETTIBONE AMERICAN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION YEAH PLEASE TO SUPPORT WITH THE THE BILL'S AMENDMENTS -- WE'VE TALKED WITH THE AUTHOR INITIALLY ARE COMPANIES WE HAVE INTERNATIONAL NATIONAL. INSURERS AND REINSURERS AND THEY ARE THE ONES DOING A LOT OF THE FOREFRONT OF THIS ACTIVITY DOING REALLY CREATIVE SOLUTIONS -- I KNOW THEY'RE EXCITED TO YOU OBVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA'S REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IS QUITE STRICT. SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I HOPE IS EXAMINED YOU KNOW AS WE GO FORWARD BECAUSE INNOVATION SOLUTIONS ARE CREATIVE. AND NEW AND SO THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION WE ALSO -- CEMENT THAT YOU TO OUR FOLKS SURGED IN THAT KIND OF THE RISK TRANSFER A MECHANISM IT ISN'T JUST INSURANCE POLICIES THERE'S A VARIETY THERE'S GOING TO BE P. THREE PROJECTS. AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT I THINK ARE GOING TO BE EXCITING TO EXAMINE TO SEE WHAT CALIFORNIA CAN DO UNDER THAT SIR WORKING GROUP AND WILL BE PLEASED TO PARTICIPATE SO THANK YOU. ARE THERE OTHER PERSONS HERE WISHING TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. AND I JUST WANNA SAY VERY INTERESTING CREATIVE APPROACH AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY COMMITTEE.

MOTHER NATURE IS ALREADY PROVIDED THESE NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURES TO PROTECT US AGAINST SEA LEVEL RISE AND A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS WHY DON'T WE ARE USES INNOVATIVE APPROACH HAS BEEN USED AROUND THE WORLD.

A SIMILAR YOU'VE GOT -- SP TWENTY FOUR YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I LIKE TO BEGIN BY. A COMMITTEE TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS LISTED ON PAGE THREE OF THE ANALYSIS A IN JUDICIARY DUE TO THE TIMING OF ITS BILL DOUBLE REFERRAL. I THINK AGAIN THE COMMITTEE FOR THE WORK THE CAR. ARE THE RESULT OF ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN STAKEHOLDERS AND I WANTED THAT I THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROCESS. AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED S. B. EIGHT TWENTY FOUR WILL PROHIBIT INSURERS FROM CANCELLING OR NOT RENEWING THE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY FOR ONE YEAR AFTER THE DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY FOR A PROPERTY LOCATED WITHIN THE FIRE PERIMETER. AS DETERMINED BY CAL FIRE OR WITHIN THE ZIP CODE ADJACENT TO THE FIRE PERIMETER. AFTER MASS DESTRUCTION FROM WILDFIRE OR FLOODS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT INSURERS ARE LIKELY TO RE EXAMINE THEIR EXPOSURE TO RISK IN THOSE IMPACTED AREAS. BY EXTENDING THE FRONT THE ISSUE TO ONE YEAR TO WHEN YOU'RE IN YOUR REQUIREMENT. UP TO HOMES IN THE MEDIA IS RUNNING DISASTER AREAS WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT HOMEOWNERS WHO MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN DAMAGED IN THE DISASTER DON'T HAVE TO STRUGGLE WITH THE SITE AND NON RENEWAL. OR CANCELLATION IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EVENT THE ONE YEAR RENEWAL REQUIREMENT PROPOSED BY THIS BILL CAN ACT AS A BUFFER TO EXTEND COVERAGE AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL AND MUCH NEEDED TIME FOR HOMEOWNERS. TO CONSIDER LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVES AS BE A TWENTY FOUR WILL ALSO OPTIMIZE THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. TO CONDUCT THE DATA CALL UNINSURED LOSSES RELATED TO FIRE AND WILDFIRES I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE INSURERS IN THE DEPARTMENT. TO REFINE THE LANGUAGE -- OF THE BIANNUAL DATA CALL WHICH WILL INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS FOR INFORMATION ON PREMIUMS THAT USE OF VIRUS CORES -- AND FIRE OR WILDFIRE INCURRED LOSSES AMONG OTHER FACTORS THIS WILL BE DONE ON A PER POLICY BASIS JOE FORMATS ABOUT THE GROWING WELFARE RISK. AND ANY BEARING THAT HAS ON THE AVAILABILITY OR AFFORDABILITY OF SOMEBODY'S INSURANCE. OF INFORM. EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND MARCH HIDE IT HIGHLIGHTED THE IMMENSE NEED FOR DATA ON THIS TOPIC THIS PROPOSED DATA BECAUSE SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM AS TECH WE ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORT THAT'S ACKERMAN MR TURN MEMBERS KAREN LAYING ON BEHALF OF THE PLAZA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND I'VE ALSO BEEN ADVICE I CAN OFFER SUPPORT ON GAP OF C. SAKON RC RC WHO ARE NOT HERE TODAY. UNFORTUNATELY BUT PLACER COUNTY BROUGHT THIS MEASURE TO THE SENATOR BECAUSE THEY WERE HIT BY THE SUPERVISORS THERE HAVE BEEN HEARING. FOR ACTUALLY COUPLE OF YEARS ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING INSURANCE THAT IS AFFORDABLE OR THE NON RENEWALS THAT HAVE BEEN OCCURRING OR A PREMIUMS GOING. I REALLY REALLY HIGH DESPITE HOMEOWNERS. A MITIGATING THEIR PROPERTY IN WAYS FOR EVEN CAL FIRE WAS USING HOMEOWNERS PROPERTY THE STAGE FOR FIRE FIGHTS AND THOSE HOMEOWNERS ARE HAVING TROUBLE. ACCESSING INSURANCE SO I THEY CAME IN AND SPOKE WITH THE SENATOR AND HE WAS A GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO MOVE. AYE TO INTRODUCE THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION I OBVIOUSLY NOW WITH THAT WITH WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR AT THE DATA ON HOW. ATTAINABLE INSURANCE IS IS CRITICAL FOR FOLKS THAT ARE LIVING IN THE WILD MAN URBAN INTERFACE THE DATA CALL PEACE WILL HOPEFULLY INFORM.

TO IRAN SURPLUS LINES WHICH ARE LIKE. THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY FALL INTO ANY KIND OF DATA THAT UP BILL THE STATE'S COLLECTING SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THOSE HOMEOWNERS.
