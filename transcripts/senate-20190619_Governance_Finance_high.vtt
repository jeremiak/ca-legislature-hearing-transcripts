SO I APOLOGIZE FOR MISTER STATE

00:41:42.533 --> 00:41:43.400
I THOUGHT THE RELATIVE AMOUNT

WOULD BE RATHER DE MINIMUS.

00:41:44.768 --> 00:41:45.269

00:41:54.245 --> 00:41:55.913
QUANTIFIED.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:56.780
IN A IN NOT AT ALL GOING TO BE

00:41:56.847 --> 00:41:58.415
ABLE TO NAIL DOWN A SPECIFIC BUT

00:41:58.482 --> 00:42:00.517
BASED OFF OF COMMITTEE ANALYSIS

00:42:00.584 --> 00:42:02.052
WE BELIEVE IT'S A USED THE TERM

00:42:02.119 --> 00:42:04.121
NEGLIGIBLE ACROSS THE STATE IN

00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:05.656
REGARDS.

00:42:05.723 --> 00:42:07.091
TO LOSSES FOR MUNICIPALITIES --

00:42:07.157 --> 00:42:08.959
BUT CAN'T NAIL THAT DOWN BUT IT

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:09.293
IS [inaudible]

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.829
VERY SMALL.

00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:12.696
IN AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT WE

00:42:12.763 --> 00:42:15.099
THINK THIS IS A VERY SMALL.

00:42:15.165 --> 00:42:16.901
INCENTIVE TO WORK AGAIN

00:42:16.967 --> 00:42:18.936
ENCOURAGE CLEAN ENERGY WE HAVE --

00:42:19.003 --> 00:42:19.670
GOALS THAT WE'VE ALREADY PUT

00:42:19.737 --> 00:42:21.138
INTO LAW TO TRY TO REDUCE

00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:22.806
GREENHOUSE.

00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:25.175
GAS EMISSIONS WE THINK THIS IS A

00:42:25.242 --> 00:42:26.210
OF GET UP ON THE L. AWAITED DO

00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:27.578
IT -- WITHOUT HAVING A VERY

00:42:27.645 --> 00:42:31.715
SIGNIFICANT FISCAL IMPACT.

00:42:31.782 --> 00:42:33.384
I WOULD JUST ADD OUR OPPOSITION

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:34.451
IS LESS ABOUTTHE RENEWABLE

00:42:34.518 --> 00:42:35.552
ENERGY WORK STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE

00:42:35.619 --> 00:42:37.087

WATER AND POWER AGENCY WE ARE

00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:42.993
WELL ON OUR WAY PAST 40% FOR

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:43.928
CLEAN ENERGY WERE.

00:42:43.994 --> 00:42:45.663
CONSTANTLY GO IN THAT DIRECTION

00:42:45.729 --> 00:42:47.398

EXEMPTION WE BELIEVE IT'S REALLY

00:42:56.941 --> 00:42:57.908
NOT THE ROLE OF THE STATE TO

00:42:57.975 --> 00:42:59.343

WOULD BE BENEFICIAL -- WE DON'T

00:50:50.046 --> 00:50:51.448

00:51:06.296 --> 00:51:06.797
AS IT.

00:51:06.863 --> 00:51:08.765

AWKWARD BUT I'M I'M SO SO

00:51:35.992 --> 00:51:37.227

FOR THOSE.

00:51:50.574 --> 00:51:51.808

COMPETITOR COMES AND GETS ALL

00:51:58.248 --> 00:52:00.016
THESE BENEFITS.

00:52:00.083 --> 00:52:00.517
AND THEN PUTS THEM AT A

00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:02.853
DISADVANTAGE.

00:52:02.919 --> 00:52:04.321

MEMBERS OF YOUR ORGANIZATION

00:52:10.026 --> 00:52:10.260
[inaudible]

00:52:10.327 --> 00:52:13.730
SO -- TO IN TERMS OF THE ISSUE

00:52:13.797 --> 00:52:14.998
WITH DATA IS THAT WE HAVE A

00:52:15.065 --> 00:52:16.233
LITTLE BIT OF A CHICKEN AND EGG

00:52:16.299 --> 00:52:17.868
PROBLEM IN THAT.

00:52:17.934 --> 00:52:19.903
WE DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA BECAUSE

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:20.871
WE HAVEN'T HAD A GOOD PROGRAM

00:52:20.937 --> 00:52:21.538
THAT WOULD SORT OF GEARED

00:52:21.605 --> 00:52:22.873
TOWARDS WERE IN THE INVESTMENT

00:52:22.939 --> 00:52:24.441
IS A WE DO ADD MORE REPORTING

00:52:24.508 --> 00:52:26.142
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SMALLER

00:52:26.209 --> 00:52:28.144
INVESTMENT IN THIS PROGRAM AND

00:52:28.211 --> 00:52:30.113
SO -- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.882
HAVE TO REPORT OUT -- THE

00:52:31.948 --> 00:52:33.116
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY THAT'S

00:52:33.183 --> 00:52:34.618
GENERATED BY THESE INVESTMENTS

00:52:34.684 --> 00:52:36.152
AS WELL AS THE DIRECT BENEFIT TO

00:52:36.219 --> 00:52:37.254
THE COMMUNITY SO.

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:39.856
HOPEFULLY WHAT WE WILL GET IS

00:52:39.923 --> 00:52:41.024
MORE INFORMATION THAT WILL HELP

00:52:41.091 --> 00:52:43.026

00:52:43.093 --> 00:52:43.994
EXPAND THIS PROGRAM.

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:45.462

ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK I'LL MAKE

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:28.505

00:54:14.651 --> 00:54:16.953
BILL WOULD IMPACTS SCHOOLS --

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:23.727
AND IS IT -- THE ARE THERE

00:54:23.793 --> 00:54:24.494
DIFFERENT THERE'S DIFFERENT

00:54:24.561 --> 00:54:26.363
TYPES OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS BASIC

00:54:26.429 --> 00:54:28.198
A SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

00:54:28.264 --> 00:54:29.699
OF OTHER OTHER KINDS OF SCHOOL

00:54:29.766 --> 00:54:32.068
DISTRICTS DOES IT IMPACT THOSE

00:54:32.135 --> 00:54:32.602
KINDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:54:32.669 --> 00:54:34.204
DIFFERENTLY [inaudible]

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:37.374
AND IN TERMS OF THINGS LIKE DEBT

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.843
SERVICE OTHER KINDS OF THINGS.

00:54:39.909 --> 00:54:40.944
SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW IT

00:54:41.011 --> 00:54:42.379
IMPACTS THE SCHOOLS.

00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:44.648
THERE WAS AN AMENDMENT I DON'T

00:54:44.714 --> 00:54:47.083
KNOW IF THE MEMBER COVERED DISH --

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:49.185
SO IT SHOULDN'T IMPACT SCHOOL

00:54:49.252 --> 00:54:52.055
FUNDING AT ALL -- THE WAY THAT

00:54:52.122 --> 00:54:55.892
IT WORKS IS THAT WE HAVE THE THE

00:54:55.959 --> 00:54:57.327
VALUE OF THE INCENTIVE PAYMENT

00:54:57.394 --> 00:55:00.563
IS BASED ON THE PROPERTY TAX

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:03.199
REVENUE -- THAT THE MANUFACTURER

00:55:03.266 --> 00:55:04.834
PAYS TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE

00:55:04.901 --> 00:55:07.003
LOCAL GOVERNMENT VAN TAKES

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:09.039
PERMITS GENERAL POT OF MONEY

INCENTIVE PAYMENT BASED ON THAT

00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:19.049
SO.

00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:19.983
I GUESS IT'S IT COMES OUT OF ITS

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:22.585
GENERAL FUNDING AND ENDED WITH

00:55:22.652 --> 00:55:25.155
AN AT THE ROOT THE ITEM SIX IN --

HAVING TO PAY ANYTHING FOR THAT --

00:55:36.232 --> 00:55:39.836
YES -- L. IS A 100% CORRECT THAT

00:55:39.903 --> 00:55:41.671
THE THE AMENDMENT -- MEANS THAT

00:55:41.738 --> 00:55:44.240

THAT IS NOT COUNTED.

00:56:09.933 --> 00:56:10.533
LIKE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.235
ARRANGEMENTS WITH COUNTIES AND

01:19:36.838 --> 01:19:37.973
OF ENSURING SAFE INADEQUATE

01:19:38.039 --> 01:19:39.074
DRINKING WATER HOWEVER THERE ARE

01:19:39.141 --> 01:19:41.376

WITH SB SIX HUNDRED AS THE BILL

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:44.279
IS.

01:19:44.346 --> 01:19:45.180
THE LEGISLATURE GAVE LAUGH

01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:46.148
BECAUSE CERTAIN STATUTORY

01:19:48.884 --> 01:19:49.951
DEVELOPMENT.

01:19:50.018 --> 01:19:51.520
THIS IS DONE IN A VARIETY OF

01:19:51.586 --> 01:19:53.421
WAYS INCLUDING THE AUTHORITY TO

01:19:53.488 --> 01:19:54.923

EXTENSION OUTSIDE THE

01:20:02.898 --> 01:20:04.733
JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARY BUT

01:20:04.799 --> 01:20:06.568
WITHIN THE SPHERE THEY DO SO IN

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:08.336
ANTICIPATION OF THE LATER CHANGE

01:20:08.403 --> 01:20:11.173
OF ORGANIZATION IN THIS CASE

01:20:11.239 --> 01:20:11.640
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN

01:20:11.706 --> 01:20:12.774
ANNEXATION.

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:14.109

EXCLUSION OF AN ANNEXATION INTO

01:20:16.344 --> 01:20:18.346
A QUALIFIED SPECIAL DISTRICT.

01:20:18.413 --> 01:20:20.215
THE LONG STANDING POLICIES OF

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:21.316
ANNEXATION ARE NOT ONLY GOOD

01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:23.385
PLANNING POLICIES IN MANY CASES

01:20:23.451 --> 01:20:25.754
THEY ARE COMMONSENSE APPROACH TO

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:27.355
MANAGING LIMITED RESOURCES.

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:29.224
BUT LET'S LOOK AT THIS ALSO FROM

01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:30.659
A SOCIAL JUSTICE PERSPECTIVE

01:20:30.725 --> 01:20:32.894
RATHER THAN PLANNING PERSPECTIVE.

01:20:32.961 --> 01:20:34.396
THESE ANNEXATION POLICIES

01:20:34.462 --> 01:20:36.231

SOME ON THE GOVERNING BOARD OF

01:20:44.072 --> 01:20:46.041
THE AGENCY PROVIDING THE SERVICE.

01:20:46.107 --> 01:20:47.375
NOR DO THEY HAVE A SAY IN ANY

01:20:47.442 --> 01:20:49.077
POTENTIAL RATE CHANGES THAT MAY

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:52.447
BEBE BE PUT BEFORE THE VOTERS

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:55.283
TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION.

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:57.385
OR WITHOUT A VOICE ONLY SERVES

01:20:57.452 --> 01:21:00.288
TO FURTHER DISENFRANCHISE THESE

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:01.056
ALREADY DISENFRANCHISED

01:21:01.122 --> 01:21:03.024
COMMUNITIES.

01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:04.059
FURTHER IS THE BILL ANALYSIS

01:21:04.125 --> 01:21:05.193
POINTS OUT THE LANGUAGE DOES NOT

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:06.628
ACTUALLY REQUIRE THE EXTENSION

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:08.296
OF SERVICE IT MERELY STATES THAT

01:21:08.363 --> 01:21:10.632
THEIR SHALL BE NO ANNEXATION.

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:12.100
IF THE DOT PREFERS TO ADDRESS

01:21:12.167 --> 01:21:13.435
THE SERVICE DEFICIENCIES STERN

GUIDE THE COMMISSION IN

01:21:27.182 --> 01:21:28.516
DETERMINING THE SIZE OF THE AREA

01:21:28.583 --> 01:21:29.484
TO BE ANNEXED.

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:30.785
WHICH ALLOWS LAUGH BECAUSE TO

01:21:30.852 --> 01:21:32.220
CONSIDER LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND

01:21:32.287 --> 01:21:33.955

TO AND TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:47.068
THIS IS NOT A COMPREHENSIVE

01:21:47.135 --> 01:21:49.304
SOLUTION TO A VERY LARGE PROBLEM

01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:52.073
WHICH IS THE DRINKING WATER

01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:52.307
ISSUE.

01:21:52.374 --> 01:21:53.575
AND THE PROPOSED POLICIES

01:21:53.642 --> 01:21:55.110
ACTUALLY CREATE SOME UNINTENDED

01:21:55.176 --> 01:21:57.746
CONSEQUENCES THE BILL GOES FAR

01:21:57.812 --> 01:21:59.180
BEYOND THE SIMPLE STATEMENT OF

01:26:00.722 --> 01:26:01.756
CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IN THE

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:03.858
IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.

01:26:03.925 --> 01:26:06.261
AS AS YOU KNOW I'M FROM A SMALL

01:26:06.327 --> 01:26:07.395
CITY SINGER.

01:26:07.462 --> 01:26:12.100
THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND I'M VERY

01:26:12.166 --> 01:26:13.001
WELL AWARE OF THE ISSUES AND

01:26:13.067 --> 01:26:14.102
WHAT BRINGS.

01:26:14.168 --> 01:26:17.539
US HERE BUT I I THINK THAT THIS

01:26:17.605 --> 01:26:18.239
BILL REALLY.

01:26:18.306 --> 01:26:20.542
KIND OF IT CREATES CHALLENGES

01:26:20.608 --> 01:26:24.879
THAT -- FOR THE COMMUNITIES.

01:26:24.946 --> 01:26:27.181
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE THE

01:26:27.248 --> 01:26:28.650
UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES AND

01:26:28.716 --> 01:26:30.184
WE'RE TRYING TO CONNECT THEM TO

01:26:30.251 --> 01:26:32.587
SERVICES WE ALL WANT THAT IN THE

01:26:32.654 --> 01:26:33.721
IN THE VALLEY AND DOES IT DON'T

01:26:33.788 --> 01:26:38.726
HAPPEN -- BUT I THINK THAT IT'S

01:26:38.793 --> 01:26:40.662
WE'RE NOT THINKING ALSO THAT

01:26:40.728 --> 01:26:41.996
THIS THE CITY'S AT THE TRYING TO

01:26:42.063 --> 01:26:44.198
CONNECT TO ARE ALSO

01:26:44.265 --> 01:26:46.734
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- SO

01:26:46.801 --> 01:26:49.604
WHEN IT COMES TO COST IT'S IT'S

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:50.104
NOT THAT.

01:26:50.171 --> 01:26:53.107
US CITIES OR COMMUNITIES DON'T

01:26:53.174 --> 01:26:55.343
WANT TO ANACS -- UNINCORPORATED

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:56.444
COMMUNITIES AS IT THEY JUST

01:26:56.511 --> 01:26:59.280
CAN'T AFFORD IT -- AND I DON'T

01:26:59.347 --> 01:27:01.015
SEE ANYTHING IN THIS BILL THAT

01:27:01.082 --> 01:27:03.418
ADDRESSES THE COST -- I THINK

01:27:03.484 --> 01:27:04.852
THAT THERE MAY BE SOME LEGAL

01:27:04.919 --> 01:27:07.088
CHALLENGES ARE POTENTIALLY POSED

01:27:07.155 --> 01:27:08.022
IN THIS.

01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:10.525
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS BILL AND --

01:27:10.592 --> 01:27:11.960
YOU KNOW FOR THE FOR THOSE

01:27:12.026 --> 01:27:14.495
REASONS SIDE I WILL NOT BE

01:27:14.562 --> 01:27:16.564
SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY.

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:18.099
I BELIEVE THE COST ISSUE WAS THE

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:19.067
ADDRESS IN THE PREVIOUS BILL

01:27:19.133 --> 01:27:21.169
FROM LAST YEAR.

01:27:21.235 --> 01:27:23.738
THAT THE DID THE DID THE STATE

01:27:23.805 --> 01:27:25.573
IS PAYING FOR THE CONNECTION.

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:27.175
OF OF OF THE WATER TO THE

01:27:27.241 --> 01:27:28.943
DISPROVED DISADVANTAGE

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:30.745
CONCOMITANT SO THIS BILL DOES

01:27:30.812 --> 01:27:34.515
NOT IMPOSE ANY ADDITIONAL COST

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:36.818
TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:27:36.884 --> 01:27:37.118
[inaudible]

01:27:37.185 --> 01:27:40.488
SOLD. FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE'S AN

01:27:40.555 --> 01:27:42.757
UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITY.

01:27:42.824 --> 01:27:43.791
THAT WANTS TO BE A NEXT TO

01:27:43.858 --> 01:27:46.127
ANOTHER CITY [inaudible]

01:27:46.194 --> 01:27:48.162
RIGHT.

WHO WHO WHAT UP THERE'S A COST

01:27:50.131 --> 01:27:52.166

01:27:52.233 --> 01:27:53.334
RIGHT THE CONNECTION YES

01:27:53.401 --> 01:27:55.336
DEFINITELY SO WHO WHO WOULD PAY

01:27:55.403 --> 01:27:57.338
FOR THAT COST OF ANY BUSINESS

01:27:57.405 --> 01:28:00.274
DISS STATE WILL PAY.

01:28:00.341 --> 01:28:02.410

THAT'S PROPOSE FOR ANNEXATION

01:28:33.408 --> 01:28:36.544

THAT IS TEN ACRES OR GREATER

01:28:46.654 --> 01:28:49.057
THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE TO KIND

01:28:49.123 --> 01:28:50.158
OF GO THROUGH THIS EXACT SAME

01:28:50.224 --> 01:28:51.993
PROCESS -- SO WE'RE NOT CHANGING

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:53.094
ANYTHING ABOUT THE PROCESS WE'RE

NOT PROPOSING ADDITIONAL COSTS

01:28:56.130 --> 01:28:57.331
WERE ESSENTIALLY.

01:28:57.398 --> 01:28:59.133
JUST TRYING TO CLARIFY THE

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:04.605

01:29:09.677 --> 01:29:10.745
PROBLEM IN CURRENT LAW

01:29:16.217 --> 01:29:16.451
IMPORTANT.

01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:18.920
PIECE ON THIS IS WELL AS IT IT'S

01:29:18.986 --> 01:29:20.088
THE TRIGGER ONLY HAPPENS WHEN IT

01:29:20.154 --> 01:29:22.423
ANNEXATION IS ALREADY MOVING

01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:24.525
FORWARD BUT A MISNOMER

THE SERVICES THAT IS ALSO A

01:29:31.299 --> 01:29:33.034
CONCERN OF OURS THAT IS NOT

01:29:33.101 --> 01:29:34.902
ADDRESSED HERE.

01:29:34.969 --> 01:29:37.105
AND THE I BELIEVE IF I

01:29:37.171 --> 01:29:39.273
UNDERSTOOD THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:41.008
CORRECTLY HE WAS REFERRING TO

01:29:41.075 --> 01:29:42.410
THE BILL THAT WAS PASSED LAST

01:29:42.477 --> 01:29:45.913
YEAR THAT PAYS -- FOR SHOULD BE

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:47.915
APPROVED BY THE WATER BOARD --

01:29:47.982 --> 01:29:49.517
THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO EXTEND THE

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:51.552
SERVICES BUT WHAT I'M HEARING

01:29:51.619 --> 01:29:53.654
SENATOR HER TADO ASK ABOUT IS

01:29:53.721 --> 01:29:56.257
THE ACTUAL ANNEXATION PROCESS

01:29:56.324 --> 01:29:58.092
WHICH HAS TO BE PAID FOR LOCALLY

01:29:58.159 --> 01:29:59.827
THE STATE DOES NOT PAY FOR

01:29:59.894 --> 01:30:01.195
ANNEXATION.

01:30:01.262 --> 01:30:02.196
AND I'M.

01:30:02.263 --> 01:30:03.865
OF THE WAY WE'RE INTERPRETING

01:30:03.931 --> 01:30:06.234
THIS BILL IT DOES FAR MORE THAN

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:10.838

01:34:12.146 --> 01:34:13.614
CONTEXT IS THAT [inaudible]

01:34:13.681 --> 01:34:15.016
COUNTY PARKER'S.

01:34:15.082 --> 01:34:16.350

WITH THE FISCAL ISSUES.

01:34:57.358 --> 01:34:59.160
BUT THE FISCAL ISSUES WERE NOT

01:34:59.226 --> 01:35:00.394
CAUSED BY THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE

01:35:00.461 --> 01:35:02.129
IN THESE AREAS.

01:35:02.196 --> 01:35:03.697
THEY WERE CAUSED BY OTHER PEOPLE

01:35:03.764 --> 01:35:05.966

01:44:46.413 --> 01:44:48.315

AND SAID HE'S THE DECIDER ROSES

01:44:59.593 --> 01:45:00.427
SUTTER BUILT ENVIRONMENT THEY

RECRUITING MORE WOMEN -- THERE

01:49:39.906 --> 01:49:41.708
WAS A CONCERN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:49:41.775 --> 01:49:43.143

WHERE THEY STRUGGLE TO FIND EVEN

01:49:45.278 --> 01:49:47.247

THEIR POOL PARTICIPANTS ARE

02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:16.962
OBLIGATED TO OF TO MAKE SURE

02:12:17.029 --> 02:12:18.997
THAT DIVERSITY IS IS PART OF

HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR

02:12:31.677 --> 02:12:32.210
SEGMENTS.

02:12:32.277 --> 02:12:33.545
ANOTHER CONCERN WE HAVE IS JUST

02:12:33.612 --> 02:12:35.113
MAKING SURE THAT IF USING MORE

02:12:35.180 --> 02:12:36.915

THIS PLACEMENT AGENCY NO.

02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:43.288
IF THERE'S ALREADY MONEY.

02:12:43.355 --> 02:12:44.723
INVEST IN ONE OF THOSE BANKS SO

02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:45.524
THAT A SECOND INVESTMENT FROM

02:12:45.590 --> 02:12:46.425
THE DIFFERENT EMPLACEMENT A

02:12:46.491 --> 02:12:47.125
DIFFERENT PLACEMENT AGENT

02:12:47.192 --> 02:12:48.760
DOESN'T BUT THE SAME TWENTY TWO

02:12:48.827 --> 02:12:49.661
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

02:12:49.728 --> 02:12:50.429
ANOTHER TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

THE SAME BANKS WERE WORKING ON

THAT WITH AUTHORS OFFICE.

02:12:52.164 --> 02:12:54.099
THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN

02:12:54.166 --> 02:12:55.634
PRICE BECAUSE ARM MULTIPLE

02:12:55.701 --> 02:12:56.935
PLAYERS IN THIS MARKET.

02:12:57.002 --> 02:12:58.170
AND THIRDLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:12:58.236 --> 02:12:59.905
STATE TREASURER'S INVESTMENT

02:12:59.971 --> 02:13:01.640
GUIDELINES THAT THEY PUBLISH

02:13:01.707 --> 02:13:03.809
EVERY YEAR -- THROUGH SIAC IT

02:13:03.875 --> 02:13:05.110
ACTUALLY DOES TAL LOCAL

02:13:05.177 --> 02:13:06.178
GOVERNMENTS THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO

02:13:06.244 --> 02:13:08.547
DIVERSIFY THEIR POOL IN SO

02:13:08.613 --> 02:13:10.515
CONCENTRATING AND 50% IN ONE

02:13:10.582 --> 02:13:13.151
THING AAIN -- IS REALLY KIND OF

02:13:13.218 --> 02:13:14.753
INCONSISTENT WITH THE OTHER ON A

02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:16.621
STATE BODIES THAT OVERSEE HOW

02:13:16.688 --> 02:13:18.323
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INVEST.

02:13:18.390 --> 02:13:20.058
AND AND FURTHER -- THERE'S NOT A

02:13:20.125 --> 02:13:21.793
LOCAL GOVERNMENT HERE SAYING

02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:23.261
THAT THEY'RE UP AGAINST THE 30%

02:13:23.328 --> 02:13:24.996
IN FACT ONLY DID THE SURVEY OF

02:13:25.063 --> 02:13:26.398
THE COUNTY TREASURER'S.

02:13:26.465 --> 02:13:27.432
THE HIGHEST AMOUNT THAT

02:13:27.499 --> 02:13:29.668
ANYBODY'S INTO THESE FOUR IS ONE

02:13:29.735 --> 02:13:31.136
POINT 5%.

02:13:31.203 --> 02:13:32.738
THE NOR NEAR THIRTY LET ALONE A

02:13:32.804 --> 02:13:35.140
DEMAND FOR FIFTY I UNDERSTAND

02:13:35.207 --> 02:13:36.441
HEARING FROM THE SPONSORS THAT

THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO BE GOING

02:13:37.342 --> 02:13:38.510
MORE AFTER CITY MONEY.

ANDSPECIAL DISTRICTS MONEY

02:13:39.845 --> 02:13:41.613
BECAUSE THE COUNTIES ARE NOT

02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:43.915
REALLY USING THIS YET -- I THINK

02:13:43.982 --> 02:13:45.083

[inaudible]

02:17:24.502 --> 02:17:26.671
A CINNAMON.

02:17:26.738 --> 02:17:28.239
MCCARTY IF WE COULD JUST LIMIT

02:17:28.306 --> 02:17:29.941

MAKES SENSE.

02:17:51.663 --> 02:17:53.298
IN THE MID THEN THAT WOULD MAKE

02:17:53.365 --> 02:17:54.299
THAT THAT WOULD WORK.

02:17:54.366 --> 02:17:57.135
THEN YOU'D BE NEEDING A 50% OR

02:17:57.202 --> 02:17:58.570
THE THIRD OPTION WAS WHY DO WE

RIVER CITY BANK -- WE DO HAVE

02:20:12.737 --> 02:20:13.638

FULL COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS

02:20:17.909 --> 02:20:19.577
WITH THEM JUST LIKE WE DO WITH.

02:20:19.644 --> 02:20:21.780
FOR PROFIT ENTITIES THEY HAVE

02:20:21.846 --> 02:20:23.148
THEIR THEIR LINES OF CREDIT WITH

02:20:23.214 --> 02:20:25.150
US THEIR LOANS WITH US I WHICH

02:20:25.216 --> 02:20:27.485
WE HELP TO GET THEM GOING -- AND

02:20:27.552 --> 02:20:29.554
THEY KEEP ALL OF THEIR DEPOSITS

02:20:29.621 --> 02:20:31.689
WITH US THEY DON'T TAG KEEP TWO

02:20:31.756 --> 02:20:32.290
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:20:32.357 --> 02:20:33.858
THEY THEY HAVE A FULL COMMERCIAL

02:20:33.925 --> 02:20:35.627
RELATIONSHIP WITH US.

02:20:35.693 --> 02:20:36.261
IN.

02:20:36.327 --> 02:20:38.229
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME THAT

02:20:38.296 --> 02:20:40.398
TRYING PARCEL THAT OUT TO TO

02:20:40.465 --> 02:20:42.167
OTHER BANKS OPTICALLY BIG BANKS

02:20:42.233 --> 02:20:43.635
THAT ARE BASED IN THE AREA THAT

02:20:43.701 --> 02:20:44.903
ARE GOING TO TAKE THE MONEY BACK

02:20:44.969 --> 02:20:48.139

WHEREVER ELSE IT IS.

02:20:49.374 --> 02:20:51.242

02:20:51.309 --> 02:20:52.443
SOME ENTITIES LIKE THE BIG

02:20:52.510 --> 02:20:53.378

GET EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:57.916
BUT THAT DOESN'T APPLY TO ALL OF

02:20:57.982 --> 02:21:01.152
THE PUBLIC SECTOR ENTITIES.

02:21:01.219 --> 02:21:01.719
RIGHT NOW IT'S WHY WE SHOULD

02:40:43.367 --> 02:40:44.334
THE GOVERNOR THAT SIRI YES.

02:40:44.401 --> 02:40:46.169
ANNOUNCED AN INITIATIVE WE WE

02:40:46.236 --> 02:40:47.971
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN A COUPLE

02:40:48.038 --> 02:40:50.073
BILLS IN THE SENATE YES I'M IN

02:40:50.140 --> 02:40:50.907
YOUR WAY.

02:40:50.974 --> 02:40:52.042
HOW DOES THIS ALL DOVETAIL

02:40:52.109 --> 02:40:59.216
TOGETHER ON WHAT'S THE VISION?

02:40:59.282 --> 02:41:01.084
SO I WOULD SAY THAT HAVING RUN A

02:41:01.151 --> 02:41:01.918
OF SITTING COUNTY DEPARTMENT FOR

02:41:01.985 --> 02:41:02.786
ELEVEN YEARS AND HAVE RUN A LOT

02:41:02.853 --> 02:41:03.920
OF PROGRAMS OR WORK IN PUBLIC

02:41:03.987 --> 02:41:04.488
POLICY.

02:41:04.554 --> 02:41:05.455
IN MANY WAYS THIS IS YOU COULD

02:41:05.522 --> 02:41:06.123
SEE THIS AS THE UMBRELLA FOR THE

02:41:06.189 --> 02:41:07.124
REST OF THE WORK.

02:41:07.190 --> 02:41:09.292
BECAUSE COMMUNITIES CAN CHOOSE

02:41:09.359 --> 02:41:11.028
WHAT IT IS THEY WANT TO WORK ON

02:41:11.094 --> 02:41:12.829
SOME CITIES HAVE DECIDED WELL

02:41:12.896 --> 02:41:13.997
THERE'S A DOMAIN SO I'M GOING TO

02:41:14.064 --> 02:41:16.066
WORK ON TO SOME CITIES HAVE

02:41:16.133 --> 02:41:18.068
DECIDED WELL I'M GONNA WORK ON A

02:41:18.135 --> 02:41:18.969
LATE MAYBE I'LL ADD ONE BECAUSE

02:41:19.036 --> 02:41:20.237
I I DON'T WANT TO JUST DO HEALTH.

02:41:20.303 --> 02:41:21.405
I WANT TO DO ALZHEIMER'S

02:41:21.471 --> 02:41:23.373
SPECIFICALLY SO IT'S REALLY

02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:25.175
ABOUT WHAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES

02:41:25.242 --> 02:41:26.843
WANT TO DO THIS ASSEMBLY

02:41:26.910 --> 02:41:28.211
LANGUAGE THAT GOES INTO THAT

02:41:28.278 --> 02:41:29.413
DOCUMENT.

02:41:29.479 --> 02:41:31.748
THAT PROVIDES SOME --

02:41:31.815 --> 02:41:34.051
INFORMATION TO THEM ABOUT WHAT

02:41:34.117 --> 02:41:35.519
MIGHT BE POSSIBLE AND THEN BY

02:41:35.585 --> 02:41:37.120
JOINING THE NETWORK YOU DO GET

02:41:37.187 --> 02:41:39.523
ACCESS IT WAS WAS SAID EARLIER.

02:41:39.589 --> 02:41:40.991
TO OUR PLANNING DOCUMENTS ARE

02:41:41.058 --> 02:41:42.526
RESEARCH ALL THE THINGS THAT WE

02:41:42.592 --> 02:41:44.194
CAN PROVIDE TO YOU THAT WE'VE

02:41:44.261 --> 02:41:45.729
ALREADY DEVELOPED FROM ACROSS

02:41:45.796 --> 02:41:47.264
THE COUNTRY NOT JUST FROM

02:41:47.330 --> 02:41:48.965
COMMUNITIES AND IN CALIFORNIA

02:41:49.032 --> 02:41:50.467
BUT THIS IS AN INITIATIVE OF

02:41:50.534 --> 02:41:52.335
COURSE THAT'S ACROSS THE COUNTRY

02:41:52.402 --> 02:41:52.836
SO.

02:41:52.903 --> 02:41:54.404
THAT'S WHY THERE'S NOT DOLLARS

02:41:54.471 --> 02:41:55.338
INVOLVED IN IT.

02:41:55.405 --> 02:41:57.207
IT'S MORE OF A MASTER PLAN FOR

02:41:57.274 --> 02:41:59.509
THE COMMUNITIES LAST QUESTION

02:41:59.576 --> 02:42:03.980
AND I'M NOT SEE THE OFFICE.

02:42:04.047 --> 02:42:05.916
OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH AS A

02:42:05.982 --> 02:42:07.918
SUPPORTER OF THE BILL.

02:42:07.984 --> 02:42:09.786
AND SO THAT WAS ALSO A CONCERN

02:42:09.853 --> 02:42:10.821
THAT THEY WERE JUST SORT OF

02:42:10.887 --> 02:42:12.022
IMPOSING SOMETHING.

02:42:12.089 --> 02:42:14.091
ARE THEY IN SUPPORT OF THE

02:42:14.157 --> 02:42:15.826
TYPICALLY AS LEGISLATION WAS

02:42:15.892 --> 02:42:17.594
FORD DEPARTMENTS ARE GOING TO

02:42:17.661 --> 02:42:19.229
ENGAGE THIS EARLY.

02:42:19.296 --> 02:42:22.265
SO -- HEY IT'S ME IT'S A MORE

02:42:22.332 --> 02:42:24.367
COMMON THAN NOT THAT DEPARTMENTS

02:42:24.434 --> 02:42:26.169
WON'T TAKE A POSITION ON THE

02:42:26.236 --> 02:42:30.907
BILL SO ALL AND THEN I THINK.

02:42:30.974 --> 02:42:32.709
YEAH NO NO ABSOLUTELY.

02:42:32.776 --> 02:42:34.144
NO NO NO NO DON'T DON'T ON

02:42:34.211 --> 02:42:34.811
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

02:42:34.878 --> 02:42:36.546
LIKE TO GET IT THE NIGHT BEFORE

02:42:36.613 --> 02:42:39.049
RIGHT NO I TRUST ME I COMPLETELY

02:42:39.116 --> 02:42:40.383
UNDERSTAND ABSOLUTELY -- FOR

02:42:40.450 --> 02:42:42.119
TWELVE YEARS YEAH YOU KNOW RIGHT

02:42:42.185 --> 02:42:43.887
RIGHT WHAT'S GOING ON WELL AND I

02:42:43.954 --> 02:42:44.721
THINK -- YOU KNOW YOU ASK

02:42:44.788 --> 02:42:46.189
QUESTION ABOUT -- THE GOVERNOR'S

02:42:46.256 --> 02:42:48.258
ORDER AND SO THAT THE GOVERNOR

02:42:48.325 --> 02:42:48.925
IS SPECIFICALLY IS ASKING

02:42:48.992 --> 02:42:50.627
STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP A MASTER

02:42:50.694 --> 02:42:52.562
PLAN AND I THINK I SEE IT AS A

02:42:52.629 --> 02:42:54.798
TOOL FOR DEVELOPING THAT PLAN SO

02:42:54.865 --> 02:42:56.399
THAT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH.

02:42:56.466 --> 02:42:58.568
WITH YOU KNOW REALLY WITH THE A.

02:42:58.635 --> 02:43:00.437
R. P. -- THEY'VE ALREADY DONE

02:43:00.504 --> 02:43:01.905
THE RESEARCH FOR THEM AND SO

02:43:01.972 --> 02:43:03.740
IT'S JUST BUT MY MY OPINION JUST

02:43:03.807 --> 02:43:05.242
CONNECTING THEM TO THESE ARE THE

02:43:05.308 --> 02:43:06.610
RESOURCES WHEN YOU'RE CONVENING

02:43:06.676 --> 02:43:08.345
THE STAKEHOLDERS YOU CAN LOOK AT

02:43:08.411 --> 02:43:10.547
THE THE THIS PLAN ALREADY TO SAY

02:43:10.614 --> 02:43:12.349
OKAY THIS IS WHAT THEY RECOMMEND

02:43:12.415 --> 02:43:13.850
CAN WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT.

02:43:13.917 --> 02:43:15.852
SO I ALSO LOOK AT IT AS A TOOL

02:43:15.919 --> 02:43:16.786
AND OF COURSE THE YOU KNOW THE

02:43:16.853 --> 02:43:18.321
DEPARTMENT WOULD ENGAGE I THINK

02:43:18.388 --> 02:43:20.690
IF THEY NED THEY NEEDED EXTRA --

02:43:20.757 --> 02:43:22.959
OUT PERSON ALRP EXTRA MONEY FOR

02:43:23.026 --> 02:43:23.793
THIS BUT BECAUSE IT'S NOT.

02:43:23.860 --> 02:43:25.395
THERE'S NO MONEY INVOLVED THE

02:43:25.462 --> 02:43:27.731
DEPARTMENT WARNING GATES THIS

02:43:27.797 --> 02:43:29.399
EARLY.

02:43:29.466 --> 02:43:30.667
MY OPINION -- THEY WOULD IF

02:43:30.734 --> 02:43:32.068
THERE WAS A COST OR ADDITIONAL

02:43:32.135 --> 02:43:33.503
WORK FOR THEM SO TO ME THAT'S A

02:43:33.570 --> 02:43:34.704
GOOD THING THAT THEY'RE NOT

02:58:18.354 --> 02:58:19.288
IT'S PROBABLY MOST OF OUR

02:58:19.355 --> 02:58:20.956
RESPONSIBILITIES UTILITY UTILIZE

02:58:21.023 --> 02:58:21.524
THAT TO ALL.

02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:22.825
RIGHT SO IF I HAVE CITIES THAT

02:58:22.892 --> 02:58:24.527
ARE NOT UTILIZING THAT TOOL I

02:58:24.593 --> 02:58:26.162
MEAN AT THIS POINT EVEN OUR

02:58:26.228 --> 02:58:27.730
GOVERNOR IS SUING CITIES THAT

02:58:27.797 --> 02:58:29.331
ARE THAT ARE NOT PRFORMING TO

02:58:29.398 --> 02:58:30.399
THEIR STANDARDS WHICH HURTS

02:58:30.466 --> 02:58:31.600
RIGHT BUT IT TAKES MORE.

02:58:31.667 --> 02:58:33.903
IT JUST TAKES ONE SORRY YOU

02:58:33.969 --> 02:58:39.108
BROUGHT IT UP.

02:58:39.175 --> 02:58:40.943
I READ IT SO I MEAN THERE ARE

02:58:41.010 --> 02:58:42.878
TEETH RIGHT THERE ARE YOU THERE

02:58:42.945 --> 02:58:44.680
ARE THERE ARE TEETH -- WE WOULD

02:58:44.747 --> 02:58:45.815
HOPE THAT.

02:58:45.881 --> 02:58:47.383
WE WOULD NEED TO USE THEM AND I

02:58:47.450 --> 02:58:48.417
KNOW IN MY DISTRICT THIS WAS A

02:58:48.484 --> 02:58:49.718
BILL THAT THAT ACTUALLY MY

02:58:49.785 --> 02:58:50.986
CONSTITUENTS AND SOME OF MY

02:58:51.053 --> 02:58:53.355
CITIES ACTUALLY ASKED TO HAVE

02:58:53.422 --> 02:58:55.658
PUT IN PLACE -- BECAUSE THEY

02:58:55.724 --> 02:58:57.393
WANT TO PARTICIPATE AND I THINK

02:58:57.460 --> 02:58:59.061
THAT FOR US LIKE THE PROFESSOR

02:58:59.128 --> 02:59:01.363
SAID ESPECIALLY LOS ANGELES WERE

02:59:01.430 --> 02:59:03.099
WERE IN IN CRISIS MODE.

02:59:03.165 --> 02:59:04.233
AND WE HAVE TO UTILIZE EVERY

02:59:04.300 --> 02:59:05.267
TOOL IN OUR TOOL SHED AND NOW

02:59:05.334 --> 02:59:07.002
THAT I KNOW ABOUT SB TO TRUST ME

02:59:07.069 --> 02:59:08.237
I WILL CHECK WITH MY CITIES AND

02:59:08.304 --> 02:59:08.938
MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE

02:59:09.004 --> 02:59:10.639
PARTICIPATING IN THE WAY THAT

02:59:10.706 --> 02:59:12.041
THEY SHOULD BE.

02:59:12.108 --> 02:59:14.910
ON THOSE -- YOU KNOW IT'S ON

02:59:14.977 --> 02:59:15.811
YOUR CITIES AND GOOD WORDS RANDY

02:59:16.779 --> 02:59:18.280
A HALF SQUARE.

02:59:18.347 --> 02:59:20.783
AND WHERE WE PUT IT I SO I HAVE

02:59:20.850 --> 02:59:21.851

02:59:23.552 --> 02:59:24.553
THEIR RIGHT.

02:59:24.620 --> 02:59:31.894
SHOULDER AND TRY IT YEAH -- SO

02:59:31.961 --> 02:59:33.529
WHY WOULD WE NEED LEGISLATION TO

02:59:33.596 --> 02:59:34.096
DO THIS WHY THIS WE'VE GOT

02:59:34.163 --> 02:59:35.097
CITIES THAT ARE DOING IT

02:59:35.164 --> 02:59:35.431
VOLUNTARILY.

02:59:35.498 --> 02:59:37.066
WHY WOULD WE HAVE TO MANDATE?

02:59:37.133 --> 02:59:38.467
AT I THINK LIKE I THINK I MEAN I

02:59:38.534 --> 02:59:39.401
AM EVERYTHING WE JUST SAID AND

02:59:39.468 --> 02:59:40.336
WE'RE IN A CRISIS MODE AND

02:59:40.402 --> 02:59:41.837
UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT

02:59:41.904 --> 02:59:42.805
SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO DO --

02:59:42.872 --> 02:59:44.206
TRUST ME THE LAST THING I WANT

02:59:44.273 --> 02:59:45.207
TO DO RIGHT NOW IS BRING YOU A

02:59:45.274 --> 02:59:47.042
BILL WHERE PEOPLE HAVE THE

02:59:47.109 --> 02:59:48.077
OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO A PARKING

02:59:48.144 --> 02:59:50.146
LOT TO TO BE SAFE AND TO HAVE A

02:59:50.212 --> 02:59:50.546
PLACE TO SLEEP.

02:59:50.613 --> 02:59:52.114
IT'S THE LAST BILL OF ALL THE

02:59:52.181 --> 02:59:53.983
THINGS WE DO HERE THAT I WANT TO

02:59:54.049 --> 02:59:54.984
I NEED TO DO.

02:59:55.050 --> 02:59:57.086
BUT PEOPLE NEED A SAFE PLACE TO

02:59:57.153 --> 02:59:58.754
STAY AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A

02:59:58.821 --> 02:59:59.889
LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:59:59.955 --> 03:00:02.024
LIVING IN THEIR CARS ESPECIALLY

03:00:02.091 --> 03:00:02.858
IN THE SOME OF THE CITIES THAT I

03:00:02.925 --> 03:00:03.859
REPRESENT.

03:00:03.926 --> 03:00:05.828
AND IF THE CITIES AND ALL CITIES

03:00:05.895 --> 03:00:07.429
ARE DOING IT LIKE YOU JUST SAID

03:00:07.496 --> 03:00:08.130

PUT THESE ARE THE TEETH.

03:00:11.100 --> 03:00:12.768
IF I CAN PUT TEETH INTO THE IDEA

03:00:12.835 --> 03:00:14.336
THAT WE NEED TO CREATE A SPACE

03:00:14.403 --> 03:00:15.571
THAT NOT ONLY GIVES PEOPLE A

03:00:15.638 --> 03:00:16.972
SAFE PLACE TO PARK SO THAT THEY

03:00:17.039 --> 03:00:18.107
CAN SLEEP AT NIGHT.

03:00:18.174 --> 03:00:19.542
BUT ON TOP OF THAT CONNECTS THEM

03:00:19.608 --> 03:00:20.776
WITH SOCIAL SERVICES THEN I'VE

03:00:20.843 --> 03:00:23.479

ITS AND AND WHAT'S NICE ABOUT

03:06:49.164 --> 03:06:50.999
THIS BILL FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.

03:06:51.066 --> 03:06:52.267
IS THAT IT PROVIDES KIND OF THE

03:06:52.334 --> 03:06:54.870
IMPETUS TO DO A EMERGENCY PLAN

03:07:06.748 --> 03:07:09.251
THAT RATIO IN OTHER PLACES AS

03:07:09.318 --> 03:07:09.885

BUILDING.

03:10:55.377 --> 03:10:57.979
AND THAT URGENCY SHOULD EXTEND --

03:10:58.046 --> 03:10:59.881
TO THE NEED FOR A DRAMATIC

03:10:59.948 --> 03:11:01.750
INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL

03:11:01.817 --> 03:11:03.185

EXPERIENCING IN THIS STATE

03:11:26.842 --> 03:11:29.377
BECAUSE WE ARE FORCING PEOPLE TO

03:11:29.444 --> 03:11:30.745
LIVE IN THEIR CARS.

03:11:30.812 --> 03:11:34.382
WHAT KIND OF SOCIETY?

03:11:34.449 --> 03:11:35.217
FORCES PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THEIR

WE'VE DONE THIS TO OURSELVES.

03:11:43.525 --> 03:11:45.360
BY MAKING IT HARDER AND HARDER

03:11:45.427 --> 03:11:47.462
AND HARDER. TO HAVE ENOUGH

03:11:47.529 --> 03:11:48.997
HOUSING.

03:11:49.064 --> 03:11:50.999
BY GENERATING THIS THREE AND A

03:11:51.066 --> 03:11:52.500
HALF MILLION HOME DEFICIT.

03:11:52.567 --> 03:11:54.536
BECAUSE WE BANNED APARTMENT

03:11:54.603 --> 03:11:55.971
BUILDINGS WITH BAND AFFORDABLE

03:11:56.037 --> 03:11:57.339
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND A LARGE

MAJORITY OF THE STATE WE HAVE

03:11:59.040 --> 03:12:00.141
SAID IT'S GOING TO TAKE YEARS

03:12:00.208 --> 03:12:02.377
AND YEARS TO GET ANY KIND OF

03:12:02.444 --> 03:12:02.611

03:12:02.677 --> 03:12:04.145
APPROVED.

03:12:04.212 --> 03:12:06.348
AND WE ARE GOING TO CREATE THE

03:12:06.414 --> 03:12:07.649
SHORTAGE AND THAT'S WHAT

03:12:07.716 --> 03:12:09.818
CALIFORNIA HAS EFFECTIVELY DONE

03:12:09.885 --> 03:12:11.353
OVER YEAR OVER THE YEARS.

03:12:11.419 --> 03:12:13.388
AND YOU KNOW SOME OF THE CITY

03:12:13.455 --> 03:12:14.990
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY.

03:12:15.056 --> 03:12:16.524

03:12:16.591 --> 03:12:18.793
OPPOSING ANY EFFORT TO SET STATE

03:12:18.860 --> 03:12:20.762
STANDARDS TO SAY YOU NEED TO

03:12:20.829 --> 03:12:22.163

IT FRONT AND CENTER THAT THIS IS

03:12:34.609 --> 03:12:36.411

STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

03:12:37.879 --> 03:12:39.314
