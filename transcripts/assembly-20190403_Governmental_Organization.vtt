00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:30.174
TWENTY TWO PEOPLE.

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.909
NEARLY ALL OF THEM FROM

00:43:31.976 --> 00:43:33.777
COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT.

00:43:33.844 --> 00:43:35.312
THE TIME WE FELT AS THOUGH WE

00:43:35.379 --> 00:43:36.780
JUST EXPERIENCE A ONCE IN A

00:43:36.847 --> 00:43:39.083
GENERATION TRAGEDY.

00:43:39.149 --> 00:43:42.553
SINCE THEN THE THOMAS WOLSEY CAR

00:43:42.619 --> 00:43:43.887
IN CAMP FIRES HAVE PROVEN US

00:43:43.954 --> 00:43:45.089
WRONG.

00:43:45.155 --> 00:43:45.889
WE NOW UNDERSTAND THAT WE

00:43:45.956 --> 00:43:48.292
EXPERIENCED IN THE TUB FIRE WHAT

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:50.027
WAS NOT A FREAK ACCIDENT OR THE

00:43:50.094 --> 00:43:50.928
PERFECT STORM.

00:43:50.995 --> 00:43:52.429
BUT THE PRODUCT OF A SYSTEMIC

00:43:52.496 --> 00:43:54.098
CRISIS.

00:43:54.164 --> 00:43:55.499
GENERATIONS OF CLEAR CUTTING

00:43:55.566 --> 00:43:57.401
FOREST'S FOLLOWED BY FIRE

00:43:57.468 --> 00:43:59.269
SUPPRESSION FOR BY COMMUNITY

00:43:59.336 --> 00:44:01.038
SPRAWLING INTO WILD LANDS ALL

00:44:01.105 --> 00:44:02.673
EXACERBATED BY A CHANGING

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.375
CLIMATE.

00:44:04.441 --> 00:44:06.143
THIS IS PUT HUNDREDS OF TOWNS IN

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:08.345
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS AT RISK

00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:09.646
OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES.

00:44:09.713 --> 00:44:11.281
THIS CRISIS CALLS FOR SWIFT BOLD

00:44:11.348 --> 00:44:12.750
ACTION AND A SIGNIFICANT

00:44:12.816 --> 00:44:13.884
INVESTMENT.

00:44:13.951 --> 00:44:15.452
AND IT HAS TO START WITH THE

00:44:15.519 --> 00:44:17.121
HOMES THEMSELVES.

00:44:17.187 --> 00:44:18.989
AB THIRTY EIGHT PROPOSES A THREE

00:44:19.056 --> 00:44:21.025
PRONGED APPROACH FIRST WE ARE

HELP PROVIDE RESOURCES TO

00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:27.398
HOMEOWNERS TO RETROFIT THEIR

00:44:27.464 --> 00:44:29.233
PREVIOUSLY CONSTRUCTED HOMES IN

00:44:29.299 --> 00:44:31.035
VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY

00:44:31.101 --> 00:44:32.403
ZONES.

00:44:32.469 --> 00:44:33.337
WE HAVE LIFTED MANY OF THE

00:44:33.404 --> 00:44:35.039
PROVISIONS FROM OTHER SUCCESSFUL

00:44:35.105 --> 00:44:37.541

00:44:37.608 --> 00:44:39.109
INCLUDING THE SEISMIC SAFETY

00:44:39.176 --> 00:44:40.577
FINANCING PROGRAM.

00:44:40.644 --> 00:44:41.545
AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THE STATE

00:44:41.612 --> 00:44:43.047
TREASURER AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:44:43.113 --> 00:44:44.681
ON HOW BEST TO ADMINISTER THE

00:44:44.748 --> 00:44:45.883
PROGRAM.

00:44:45.949 --> 00:44:47.284
SECOND WE ARE WORKING WITH FIRE

00:44:47.351 --> 00:44:48.619
SCIENTISTS AND BUILDING ON MS

00:44:48.685 --> 00:44:51.188

00:44:57.061 --> 00:44:58.362
RASKIN HOMEOWNERS TO CERTIFY

00:44:58.429 --> 00:45:00.364
THAT THESE RETROFITS OF TAKEN

00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:01.899
PLACE BEFORE AT THE TOP OF THE

00:45:01.965 --> 00:45:02.699
HOME IS SOLD.

00:45:02.766 --> 00:45:04.435
FINALLY WE'RE PROPOSING A STATE

00:45:04.501 --> 00:45:06.203
WILD FIRE PREPAREDNESS BOARD AND

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:07.738
A NETWORK OF REGIONAL WILDFIRE

00:45:07.805 --> 00:45:09.206
PREVENTION DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE

00:45:09.273 --> 00:45:10.841
PLANNING.

00:45:10.908 --> 00:45:11.909
EDUCATIONAL AND SOME AND

00:45:11.975 --> 00:45:13.510
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CAPACITY TO

00:45:13.577 --> 00:45:15.446
FIRE PRONE COMMUNITIES ACROSS

00:45:15.512 --> 00:45:16.747
THE STATE.

00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:18.849
THEIR ENTRY ENTITIES ALL OVER

00:45:18.916 --> 00:45:20.517
CALIFORNIA DOING GREAT WORK OF

00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:22.052
PREPARING COMMITTEES FOR FIRE.

00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:22.886
BUT IS EXCEPTIONALLY

00:45:22.953 --> 00:45:24.855
INCONSISTENT FROM COMMUNITY TO

00:45:24.922 --> 00:45:26.056
COMMUNITY.

00:45:26.123 --> 00:45:27.858
AND IS OFTEN THE CASE THE

00:45:27.925 --> 00:45:28.959
COMMUNITIES WITH THE FEWER THE

00:45:29.026 --> 00:45:31.795
FEWEST RESOURCES TO SPARE ARE

00:45:31.862 --> 00:45:33.297
GENERALLY LESS PREPARED.

00:45:33.363 --> 00:45:34.865
MEMBERS THIS IS NOT A SILVER

00:45:34.932 --> 00:45:37.301
BULLET IS TAKEN AS GENERATIONS

00:45:37.367 --> 00:45:38.869
TO GET INTO THIS SITUATION IT

00:45:38.936 --> 00:45:39.670
WILL TAKE US YEARS TO GET OUT OF

00:45:39.736 --> 00:45:40.504
IT.

00:45:40.571 --> 00:45:43.140
BUT I BELIEVE AB THIRTY EIGHT

00:45:43.207 --> 00:45:45.609
MOVES US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

00:45:45.676 --> 00:45:46.443
HERE IN SAID TO TESTIFY IN

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:48.078
SUPPORT IS FORMER STATE FIRE

00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:52.216
AND LIVED LIVES FORSBERG WITH

00:45:52.282 --> 00:45:56.320
THE NATURE CONSERVANCY.

00:45:56.386 --> 00:45:57.421
THANK YOU I'LL GO FIRST I AM

00:45:57.488 --> 00:45:59.123
CAIT DARGAN SPEAKING ON BEHALF

HIS EFFORT TO DO A DIFFICULT

00:46:04.194 --> 00:46:05.496
TASK.

00:46:05.562 --> 00:46:07.331
UP I'LL TELL A SHORT STORY ABOUT

00:46:07.397 --> 00:46:08.866
HOW WE GOT TO THIS PARTICULAR

00:46:08.932 --> 00:46:10.067
JUNCTURE WITH THE CALIFORNIA

00:46:10.134 --> 00:46:12.603
BUILDING CODES IN TWO THOUSAND

00:46:12.669 --> 00:46:15.072
AND ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND ONE

00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:16.874
WE BEGIN A RESEARCH PROJECT AT

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.408
THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE.

00:46:18.475 --> 00:46:20.144
TO DETERMINE HOW BUILDING

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:21.678
SPECIFICALLY BURNT RELATIVE TO

00:46:21.745 --> 00:46:24.314
WILD FIRE THAT RESULTED IN FIVE

00:46:24.381 --> 00:46:25.782
TESTING STANDARDS WHICH WE THEN

00:46:25.849 --> 00:46:27.351
CONVERTED INTO THE FIRST EVER

00:46:27.417 --> 00:46:29.686
CHAPTER SEVEN A CALIFORNIA

00:46:29.753 --> 00:46:31.655
BUILDING -- CODE.

00:46:31.722 --> 00:46:32.389
WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE

00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:35.092
BUILDING STANDARDS AT THAT TIME

00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:38.662
THOSE PROVISIONS WERE TARGETED

00:46:38.729 --> 00:46:39.863
FOR AT NEW CONSTRUCTION.

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:41.465
SINCE THAT TIME WE HAVE ALL

00:46:41.532 --> 00:46:43.433
BECOME PAINFULLY AWARE THAT IT

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.769
IS THE EXISTING HOUSING STOCK

00:46:45.836 --> 00:46:49.640
THAT IS AT DIRE RISK A DISASTER

00:46:49.706 --> 00:46:51.842
FROM WILDFIRES. TO CORRECT THAT

00:46:51.909 --> 00:46:53.710
PROBLEM THERE IS REALLY ONLY ONE

00:46:53.777 --> 00:46:55.379
WAY FORWARD AND THAT IS TO

00:46:55.445 --> 00:46:57.247
ADDRESS PHYSICAL CHANGE WITHIN

00:46:57.314 --> 00:46:58.815
THE ZONE THAT WE CALL THE

00:46:58.882 --> 00:47:00.384
STRUCTURAL IGNITION ZONE AND

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:01.919
THAT PHYSICAL CHANGES CHANGING

00:47:01.985 --> 00:47:03.420
THE BUILDING ELEMENTS THAT ARE

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:06.356
MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO AMBER

00:47:06.423 --> 00:47:07.624
INTRUSION FROM WILD FIRE.

00:47:07.691 --> 00:47:08.959
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS

00:47:09.026 --> 00:47:10.227
IMPORTANT FOR COMMUNITY

00:47:10.294 --> 00:47:11.828
PROTECTION BUT TO GET TO

00:47:11.895 --> 00:47:13.597
BUILDING PROTECTION TO PROTECT

00:47:13.664 --> 00:47:15.532
INDIVIDUAL HOMES FROM THE THREAT

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:18.268
OF EMBERS INDIRECT FLAME WE HAVE

00:47:18.335 --> 00:47:19.836
TO CHANGE THE COMPONENTS OF THE

00:47:19.903 --> 00:47:21.271
EXCUSE ME OF THAT BUILDING.

00:47:21.338 --> 00:47:23.006
SO THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE NEED

00:47:23.073 --> 00:47:24.741
FOR RETROFITS ON THE OVER TWO

00:47:24.808 --> 00:47:26.610
MILLION HOMES THAT DO EXIST AS

00:47:26.677 --> 00:47:28.412
EXISTING HOUSING.

00:47:28.478 --> 00:47:29.580
STOCK OUT THERE IN THE STATE.

00:47:29.646 --> 00:47:32.783
AND YES IT WILL TAKE AWHILE IT

00:47:32.849 --> 00:47:34.518
IS A DIFFICULT LEFT BUT THERE IS

00:47:34.585 --> 00:47:35.719
ONLY ONE WAY TO GET THERE AND

00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:36.887
THAT IS TO CREATE BOTH A

00:47:36.954 --> 00:47:38.755
DEFENSIBLE SPACE OWN AROUND THE

00:47:38.822 --> 00:47:39.656
STRUCTURE.

00:47:39.723 --> 00:47:41.158
AND THE IMPORTANT BUILDING

00:47:41.225 --> 00:47:43.160
ELEMENTS SUCH AS WINDOWS VANCE

00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:44.661
ROOFING MATERIALS COVERED

00:47:44.728 --> 00:47:46.463
GUTTERS IT CETERA THAT PREVENTS

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:49.499
THE INTRUSION OF EMBERS -- FOR

00:47:49.566 --> 00:47:51.068
THAT BUILDING RISK WITHOUT THOSE

00:47:51.134 --> 00:47:53.904
ELEMENTS DEFENSIBLE SPACE ALONE

00:47:53.971 --> 00:47:55.439
WILL NOT PROTECT THE STRUCTURE

00:47:55.505 --> 00:47:57.274
NOR WILL JUST VEGETATION

00:47:57.341 --> 00:47:58.942
MANAGEMENT THIS IS A CRITICAL

00:47:59.009 --> 00:47:59.743
STEP.

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:02.246
IN THE RESILIENCY DEVELOPMENT

00:48:02.312 --> 00:48:03.146

00:48:21.765 --> 00:48:23.433
DESTRUCTIVE AND DEADLY US.

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:24.668
IN THE FACE OF MAKE THE FIRES WE

00:56:17.774 --> 00:56:18.441
LIKE I SAY WE'RE NOT TALKING

00:56:18.508 --> 00:56:19.576
ABOUT ROOFS WHEN I TALK ABOUT

00:56:19.642 --> 00:56:20.777
CITING?

00:56:20.844 --> 00:56:22.445
AND KEEPING YOU KNOW KEEPING

00:56:22.512 --> 00:56:23.880
THINGS AWAY FROM YOUR HOUSE AT A

00:56:23.947 --> 00:56:26.916
COMBUSTIBLE -- CERTAINLY -- IT'S

00:56:26.983 --> 00:56:28.451
NOT AN EXPENSIVE THING TO DO

00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:31.588
NECESSARILY -- MAYBE THE STATE

00:56:31.654 --> 00:56:33.590
FIRE MARSHAL WOULD LIKE TO OUR

00:56:33.656 --> 00:56:34.224
FORMER STATE FIRE MARSHAL LIKE

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:37.193
TO WIN THE AYE I UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:39.362
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:56:39.429 --> 00:56:41.831
BUT IT I STAFF.

00:56:41.898 --> 00:56:42.599
HOW MANY EXCEPTIONS DO WE DO WE

00:56:42.665 --> 00:56:45.535
PUT IN PLACE HERE OVER TIME --

00:56:45.602 --> 00:56:46.736
AND TO END UP CREATING A BIGGER

00:56:46.803 --> 00:56:48.004
PROBLEM THAN THAN WHAT YOU

00:56:48.071 --> 00:56:50.106
ALREADY YOU'VE ALREADY SPOKEN

00:56:50.173 --> 00:56:51.474
ABOUT YOUR ABSOLUTE RIGHT CITIES

00:56:51.541 --> 00:56:53.643
DON'T ENFORCE WHAT THEY SHOULD

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:54.210
BE DOING AND THEY SHOULD BE

00:56:54.277 --> 00:56:56.446
DOING THAT -- COUNTIES OR NOT

00:56:56.513 --> 00:56:57.847
AND FORCING WITH THEY SHOULD BE

00:56:57.914 --> 00:56:58.882
DOING AND THEY SHOULD BE DOING

00:56:58.948 --> 00:57:00.950
THAT -- OUR STATE AGENCIES ARE

00:57:01.017 --> 00:57:03.153
NOT ALWAYS DOING THAT AS WELL --

00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:04.921
WE SHOULD AND AND WE SHOULD BE

00:57:04.988 --> 00:57:06.456
DOING THAT AND I WOULD HOPE THAT

00:57:06.523 --> 00:57:08.491
PEOPLE WOULD WAKE UP AND REALIZE

00:57:08.558 --> 00:57:10.260
THAT WE HAVE TO ENFORCE THOSE

00:57:10.326 --> 00:57:11.928
RULES ARE ON THE BOOK AND PEOPLE

00:57:11.995 --> 00:57:12.595
NEED TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT.

00:57:12.662 --> 00:57:14.631
BUY THEIR OWN HOMES NOT TRYING

00:57:14.697 --> 00:57:15.398
TO I KNOW THERE'S GOING TO

00:57:15.465 --> 00:57:16.599
CREATE SOME HEARTBURN FOR PEOPLE

00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:18.301
ON THIS I HAVE A LOT OF POOR

00:57:18.368 --> 00:57:19.769
PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITIES WHICH

00:57:19.836 --> 00:57:22.138
IS WHY WE SET UP THIS FINE --

00:57:22.205 --> 00:57:23.306
AND LIKE I SAID WHEN YOU GO TO

00:57:23.373 --> 00:57:23.940
SELL A HOUSE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

00:57:24.007 --> 00:57:25.408
MORE MONEY ON THE TABLE THAN YOU

00:57:25.475 --> 00:57:29.312
PROBABLY EVER WILL -- AND WE YOU

00:57:29.379 --> 00:57:32.816
KNOW WE WE WE RECOGNIZE THAT

00:57:32.882 --> 00:57:34.484
THAT'S POTENTIAL CHALLENGE.

00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:36.319
WELL I I I APPRECIATE THAT I

00:57:36.386 --> 00:57:37.253
ANOTHER QUESTION IS WITH RESPECT

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:38.188
TO LOW COST IS NOT WELL DEFINED

00:57:38.254 --> 00:57:38.855
INSIDE THE BILL.

00:57:38.922 --> 00:57:40.890
HOW DO WE REALLY REMEDY THAT

00:57:40.957 --> 00:57:42.358
BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU I'M IN

00:57:42.425 --> 00:57:44.327
THE PROCESS OF REMODELING AN

00:57:44.394 --> 00:57:45.495
EXTERIOR OF THE HOUSE?

00:57:45.562 --> 00:57:47.263
TRYING TO DO THE HARDENING.

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:51.701
AND IT'S NOT LOW COST IT COSTS A

00:57:51.768 --> 00:57:52.635
LOT BUT MARTY PLAYING ON IT IT

00:57:52.702 --> 00:57:53.670
COSTS A LOT TO PUT THE MUCH MORE

00:57:53.736 --> 00:57:56.105
SECURED SO YOU DON'T GET THE

00:57:56.172 --> 00:57:57.507
EMBERS INSIDE.

00:57:57.574 --> 00:57:59.442
THESE ARE A LOT OF WHAT'S THAT

00:57:59.509 --> 00:58:01.444
PEOPLE HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND

00:58:01.511 --> 00:58:02.712
ENGINEERS HAVE TO PLAN OUT.

00:58:02.779 --> 00:58:04.314
SYSTEMATICALLY.

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.148
AND NOT ALL OF IT IN FACT MOST

00:58:05.215 --> 00:58:07.383
OF IT IS NOT LOW COST.

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:09.619
SO HOW DO WE GET THROUGH THAT

00:58:09.686 --> 00:58:13.423
LANGUAGE OF THE LOW COST.

00:58:13.489 --> 00:58:14.624
WELL AT THE STATE ARE OF THAT

00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:16.659
OUR FORMER STATE FIRE MARSHAL

00:58:16.726 --> 00:58:18.761
WEIGH IN ON THAT I KNOW I

00:58:18.828 --> 00:58:21.164
APPRECIATE THAT.

00:58:21.231 --> 00:58:21.598
YOUR HELP.

00:58:21.664 --> 00:58:23.099
I'LL START WITH YOUR FIRST

00:58:23.166 --> 00:58:24.400
QUESTION JUST -- I HAVE THE

00:58:24.467 --> 00:58:25.535
LUXURY OF BEING WELL INFORMED ON

00:58:25.602 --> 00:58:26.469
THE ISSUE.

00:58:26.536 --> 00:58:27.837
AND RETIRED.

00:58:27.904 --> 00:58:30.406
SO I CAN SPEAK AS FRANKLY AS I

00:58:30.473 --> 00:58:33.142
CHOOSE TO SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE --

00:58:33.209 --> 00:58:34.611
I GUESS I WANT TO GO BACK TO MY

00:58:34.677 --> 00:58:36.613
FOR THE FIRST FEW SENTENCES IN

00:58:36.679 --> 00:58:37.614
MY TESTIMONY.

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:40.817
THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY FORWARD ON

00:58:40.884 --> 00:58:42.685
DEALING WITH THE RISK THAT

00:58:42.752 --> 00:58:44.954
EXISTING STRUCTURES FACE

00:58:45.021 --> 00:58:46.823
RELATIVE TO WILD FIRE AND THAT

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:51.094
IS A CONCERTED EFFORT. TO ENABLE

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:54.063
RETROFITS AND PROVIDE DEFENSIBLE

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:56.532
SPACE THAT IS BOTH THAT IS A

00:58:56.599 --> 00:58:59.369
HEAVY LIFT IT WILL TAKE US YEARS

00:58:59.435 --> 00:59:00.003
IF NOT.

00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:02.272
I MEAN IT WILL TAKE US DECADES

00:59:02.338 --> 00:59:03.973
TO GET THROUGH THAT PROBLEM BUT

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.742
WE MUST START SOMEWHERE THIS

00:59:05.808 --> 00:59:07.911
BILL IS A WORTHY BEGINNING

00:59:07.977 --> 00:59:09.379
EFFORT TO DEAL WITH THE RETROFIT

00:59:09.445 --> 00:59:11.014
QUESTION AND ENFORCEMENT IS AN

00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:13.383
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY COMPONENT.

00:59:13.449 --> 00:59:14.951
AND ALL COMMUNITIES WHETHER THEY

00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:17.320
BE LOCAL OR STATE OR FEDERAL

00:59:17.387 --> 00:59:18.121
SHOULD BE ENFORCING.

00:59:18.187 --> 00:59:19.255
THE RULES THAT WE HAVE ON THE

00:59:19.322 --> 00:59:22.158
BOOKS WE HAVE HAD P. R. C. FORTY

00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:22.792
TWO NINETY ONE DEFENSIBLE SPACE

00:59:22.859 --> 00:59:24.694
REQUIREMENTS ON THE BOOKS FOR

00:59:24.761 --> 00:59:25.962
FIFTY YEARS YOU HAVE HEARD THIS

00:59:26.029 --> 00:59:27.797
BEFORE IN MY TESTIMONY TO OTHER

00:59:27.864 --> 00:59:29.098
COMMITTEES.

00:59:29.165 --> 00:59:30.767
THOSE PROVISIONS NEED TO BE

00:59:30.833 --> 00:59:33.603
FULLY ENFORCED AROUND THE STATE.

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:36.105
RETROFITS MUST BEGIN.

00:59:36.172 --> 00:59:37.640
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO PROTECT

00:59:37.707 --> 00:59:39.242
OUR HOMES WITHOUT TACKLING THIS

00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:40.743
ISSUE.

00:59:40.810 --> 00:59:42.645
RELATIVE TO LOW COST ALL GOOD

00:59:42.712 --> 00:59:44.280
PUBLIC PROGRAMS BEGIN WITH A

00:59:44.347 --> 00:59:46.416
PHASED APPROACH AND SOME

00:59:46.482 --> 00:59:48.284
CAPACITY BUILDING TO BEGIN THE

00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:50.887
PROCESS AND I THINK THIS BILL.

00:59:50.954 --> 00:59:52.422
CUES THAT UP WE ARE GOING TO

00:59:52.488 --> 00:59:54.357
LEARN ALONG THE WAY I THINK LOW

00:59:54.424 --> 00:59:56.392
COST UNDER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:57.694
IS A BENCHMARK.

00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:58.995
UNDERNEATH THAT FOR WHAT WOULD

00:59:59.062 --> 01:00:00.730
BE ELIGIBLE WITHIN THE LOAN I'M

01:00:00.797 --> 01:00:02.532
THROWING THAT OUT AS AN IDEA.

01:00:02.598 --> 01:00:05.101
BUT THERE ARE A FEW COMPONENTS

01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:06.469
TAKING DOWN THE LIST IN TERMS OF

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:07.670
WHAT.

01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:09.172
IS MOST EFFECTIVE.

01:00:09.238 --> 01:00:12.709
AND THE COMBINATION OF A FIRE OR

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:13.943
IGNITION RESISTANT ROUGH WHICH

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:16.179
ASPHALT SHINGLE ROOFS OR BETTER

01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:18.715
MEET AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:20.350
DRAMATICALLY INCREASE A HOMES

01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:22.251
ABILITY TO SURVIVE.

01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:24.420
VANCE AND SOFT PROTECTION ARE

01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:26.122
THE NEXT ON THAT LIST AND

01:00:26.189 --> 01:00:28.725
DEFENSIBLE SPACE AFTER THAT

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:30.793
THANK YOU.

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.229
I THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I WOULD

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:34.931
RECOGNIZING CONCUR WITH YOU

01:00:34.998 --> 01:00:36.132
THERE IS THIS A SERIES OF STEPS

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:37.600
HERE TO ACHIEVE.

01:00:37.667 --> 01:00:40.303
A TRUE HARDEN -- ENVIRONMENT BUT

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:41.838
EACH OF THOSE STEPS COMES WITH A

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:42.805
COST.

01:00:42.872 --> 01:00:44.307
AND AS WE ARE ALL STRUGGLING

01:00:44.374 --> 01:00:46.009
DOCTOR WOULD MYSELF EVERY MEMBER

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:48.678
HERE IS STRUGGLING STRUGGLING

01:00:48.745 --> 01:00:50.880
DESPERATELY WITH FINDING

01:00:50.947 --> 01:00:52.348
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR PEOPLE.

01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:53.249
WE'RE PUTTING ANOTHER NAIL IN

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:56.753
THE COFFIN OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:57.587
IN THE STATE.

01:00:57.653 --> 01:00:58.988
WHICH IS MAKING IT MORE AND MORE

01:00:59.055 --> 01:01:00.957
DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO ENJOY

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:01.891
THE LUXURIES OF THE STATE NOW

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:04.527
GIVEN THAT SAID IT ALSO IS THE

01:01:04.594 --> 01:01:05.728
OTHER CONUNDRUM.

01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:08.364
WHICH IS BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A A

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:09.966
NEW SCENARIO OF LIFE OR WILDFIRE

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:11.401
IS THE THREAT.

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:14.070
WE'RE DRIVING UP THE COST THERE

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:15.338
AS WELL SO.

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:16.873
IT'S A HARD HARD ISSUE TO DEAL

01:01:16.939 --> 01:01:19.876
WITH BUT RIGHT NOW WITHOUT THOSE

01:01:19.942 --> 01:01:21.611
AMENDMENTS DOCTOR WHAT I I FIND

01:01:21.677 --> 01:01:22.412
MYSELF.

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:23.046
A LITTLE CHALLENGE SO HOPEFULLY

01:01:23.112 --> 01:01:24.313
THROUGH THE SERIES OF QUESTIONS

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.181
OF OTHER MEMBERS ARE GOING TO

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:27.316
ASK I MIGHT FIND IT A DIFFERENT

01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:32.021
MINDSET BUT ALL ALL.

01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:33.923
A CLOSE UP WITH MY QUESTIONING

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.524
AND SINCE THE CHAIR I SEE NOW

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:35.258
THE CHAIR HAS.

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:37.226
DISAPPEARED AND I AM NOW THE

01:01:37.293 --> 01:01:42.131
ACTING -- LET ME.

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:44.267
WHO WAS FIRST BECAUSE I WASN'T

01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:45.001
PAYING ATTENTION THAT?

01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:48.271
OKAY MISTER GALLAGHER YOU HAVE A

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:50.840
QUESTION AND THEN MR DAILY.

01:01:50.907 --> 01:01:51.107
AND THEN.

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:55.244
DODD -- SO I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE

01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:56.546
THE ISSUE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:01:56.612 --> 01:01:57.880
TACKLE HERE AS IT IS AN

01:01:57.947 --> 01:02:01.451
IMPORTANT ONE AND AND PROBABLY

01:02:01.517 --> 01:02:03.186
NO.

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:04.454
ONE THE TWO OF US BUT THE TWO OF

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:05.288
US PROBABLY KNOW THAT MORE THEM

01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:06.522
US RIGHT OBVIOUSLY WITH

01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:07.090
EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE GONE

01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:07.356
THROUGH.

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:08.591
WHO LAST COUPLE YEARS AND ONE OF

01:02:08.658 --> 01:02:10.359
THE THINGS THAT I'VE HEARD? SIX

01:02:10.426 --> 01:02:11.260
CERTAINLY IN THE AFTERMATH OF

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:12.595
THE CAMPFIRE WAS.

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:13.796
DEFENSIBLE SPACE THAT WAS

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:14.897
DEFINITELY AN ISSUE.

01:02:14.964 --> 01:02:16.766
AND AND AND BEING ABLE TO

01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:18.468
ENFORCE THAT BECAUSE MAYBE SOME

01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:19.869
PEOPLE DECIDED I'M JUST NOT

01:02:19.936 --> 01:02:20.937
GOING TO DO IT.

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:23.272
AND PROPERTY OWNERS NOT REALLY

01:02:23.339 --> 01:02:24.774
HAVING THE ABILITY OR

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:26.876
NEIGHBORING PROPERTY OWNERS NOT

01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:27.477
REALLY HAVING THE ABILITY OR

01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:28.344
HARD NOT HAVING THE TEETH TO BE

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:29.979
ABLE TO ENFORCE THAT DEFENSIBLE

01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:32.281
SPACE.

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:33.549
DEFINITELY WANT THEY ARE HEARD.

01:02:33.616 --> 01:02:35.051
AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT I

01:02:35.118 --> 01:02:36.786
HEARD WAS AS WAS TALK ABOUT THE

01:02:36.853 --> 01:02:39.288
THE MANY OF THE HOMES BURNED.

01:02:39.355 --> 01:02:41.157
UP THERE FROM THE INSIDE OUT

01:02:41.224 --> 01:02:42.758
BECAUSE EMBERS HAD ACTUALLY

01:02:42.825 --> 01:02:44.460
GOTTEN IN UNDER THE EAVES.

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:46.762
INTO THE INTO THE HOMES AND IN

01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:48.931
THAT AND THE FIRE ACTUALLY BURN

01:02:48.998 --> 01:02:50.566
FROM THE INSIDE OUT SO.

01:02:50.633 --> 01:02:52.435
I THINK BOTH OF THOSE THINGS ARE

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:54.470
IMPORTANT -- AND I THINK THAT'S

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:55.037
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET AT

01:02:55.104 --> 01:03:02.879
HERE -- THE THE ONE THING THAT I

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:04.347
THINK I'M I I MAY BE TROUBLED

01:03:04.413 --> 01:03:05.314
WITH HIS.

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:07.650
IS OKAY WE KNOW WE NEED TO TRY

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:09.685
AND HELP RETROFIT THOSE.

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:11.154
THOSE BUILDINGS BUT IT MIGHT

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.355
TAKE TIME LIKE YOU SAID YOU KNOW

01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:13.789
I THINK THE FIRE MARSHAL SAID

01:03:13.856 --> 01:03:15.591
THIS COULD TAKE A DECADE OR MORE.

01:03:15.658 --> 01:03:16.792
GET IT SEEMS LIKE IN THE BILL WE

01:03:16.859 --> 01:03:19.529
HAVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AS AS

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:21.564
THE DEADLINE.

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:22.198
YOU KNOW CONSIDERING THAT COULD

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:23.866
BE I MEAN IF YOU CONSIDER MAYBE

01:03:23.933 --> 01:03:26.402
MOVING THAT. TO MAKE THIS MORE

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:28.004
OF A PHASED IN APPROACH BECAUSE

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:29.872
IT IS GOING TO TAKE TIME AND

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:30.806
THERE IS GOING TO BE OF EVEN

01:03:30.873 --> 01:03:32.675
WITH SOME MONEY AVAILABLE THERE

01:03:32.742 --> 01:03:33.109
THERE'S GOING TO BE

01:03:33.176 --> 01:03:34.777
AFFORDABILITY ISSUES MAYBE

01:03:34.844 --> 01:03:36.145
THAT'S THE FIRST.

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:38.147
QUESTION I THINK I THINK WERE

01:03:38.214 --> 01:03:40.550
I'M HAPPY TO CONSIDER HAPPY

01:03:40.616 --> 01:03:41.751
CONSIDER THAT I GUESS I MEAN.

01:03:41.817 --> 01:03:43.653
HOW MANY MORE YEARS OF

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:44.587
CATASTROPHIC FIRES WE HAVE HOW

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:46.255
MANY MORE LIVES HAVE TO BE LOST

01:03:46.322 --> 01:03:49.392
HOW FAR DO WE PUSH THIS OUT?

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:50.493
YOU KNOW I MEAN I WOULD HOPE

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.428
THAT HOMEOWNERS WOULD.

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:54.430
BEGIN TO REALIZE I NEED TO DO

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:55.932
SOMETHING TO PROTECT MY HOME.

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:57.300
THESE ARE LOW COST SOME OF THESE

01:03:57.366 --> 01:03:59.202
ARE PRACTICALLY NO COST JUST

01:03:59.268 --> 01:04:01.170
ROLL ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES OR

01:04:01.237 --> 01:04:02.104
HAVE SOMEONE HELP YOU A LITTLE

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:05.841
BIT -- AT WHAT POINT DO WE TAKE

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:07.843
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR SOME

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:08.811
OF THESE ISSUES AND HELP PREVENT

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:13.082
AS MUCH AS WE CAN -- WE SETTING

01:04:13.149 --> 01:04:15.284
UP A REVOLVING LOAN FUND -- ENDS

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:17.653
WITH LOW AND NO INTEREST LOANS --

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:19.055
CAN REALLY HELP SOME OF THE

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:20.089
LOWEST IN THE WITH THE POOREST

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:23.092
FOLKS IN OUR STATE -- AND THESE

01:04:23.159 --> 01:04:24.961
OTHER OTHER RETROFITS ARE OR

01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:25.962
TRIGGERED AT THE SALE OF THE

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:28.464
SALE OF A HOME -- I RECOGNIZE

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:29.332
THAT THERE'S THERE IS SOME

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:30.833
POTENTIAL HARPER ON THIS BUT I

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.602
WILL TELL YOU HAVING YOUR HOUSE

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:33.903
BURNED DOWN IS PROBABLY THE

01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:35.471
WORST HEARTBURN OF ALL AND

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:38.474
THAT'S WERE TRYING TO PREVENT

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:38.674
HERE.

01:04:38.741 --> 01:04:39.842
RIGHT SO.

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:41.043
BUT A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS OKAY

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:41.844
WHERE DOES THAT MONEY COME FROM

01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:42.912
RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING

01:04:42.979 --> 01:04:43.713
ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS OF THE

01:04:43.779 --> 01:04:45.381
GENERAL FUND THAT'S ALWAYS A

01:04:45.448 --> 01:04:48.351
REALLY BIG ASK YOU KNOW AND I'M

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:48.985
SURE THAT AT SOME POINT THEY'RE

01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:49.452
GOING TO SAY WELL.

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:51.520
DO YOU HAVE A FUN DO YOU HAVE

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:53.089
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN PULL FROM.

01:04:53.155 --> 01:04:54.090
I GUESS I'LL BE ONE PART AND

01:04:54.156 --> 01:04:55.758
THEN YOU SAID HEY WHEN YOU SELL

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:57.393
YOUR HOUSE YOU HAVE MORE MONEY.

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:58.461
THAN YOU EVER GOING TO HAVE WILL

01:04:58.527 --> 01:05:00.396
ONLY WHEN THE HOUSE IS SOLD IN

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:02.331
MONEY GETS TRANSFERRED TO YOU

01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:02.932
OUT OF ESCROW

01:05:02.999 --> 01:05:05.101
BETTER THIS BILL YOU'RE NOT

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:06.302
GOING TO GET THAT MONEY.

01:05:06.369 --> 01:05:06.769
UNTIL YOU'VE SHOWN A

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:08.704
CERTIFICATION THAT YOU'VE DONE

01:05:08.771 --> 01:05:09.438
SOMETHING SO YOU DON'T HAVE

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:12.174
MONEY. TO USE THAT SALE.

01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:13.242
THAT MONEY IS NOT GOING TO BE

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:14.577
AVAILABLE TO YOU UNTIL YOU

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:16.178
ACTUALLY.

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:17.546
DO YOU PUT IN THE IMPROVEMENT

01:05:17.613 --> 01:05:22.051
RIGHT -- SO CAN YOU MAYBE GO TO

01:05:22.118 --> 01:05:23.719
THAT POINT AND I JUST HAVE ONE

01:05:23.786 --> 01:05:24.954
LAST QUESTION SOME OF IT IF

01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:25.955
YOU'RE LOW IN A IF IF IT'S IF

01:05:26.022 --> 01:05:27.123
YOU'RE VERY LOW INCOME YOU'RE

01:05:27.189 --> 01:05:28.624
GOING TO QUALIFY FOR THIS AND

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:30.026
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THAT.

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:32.862
GET THAT RESOURCE THERE -- FROM

01:05:32.928 --> 01:05:34.597
THIS FUND YEAH RIGHT BUT THEN

01:05:34.664 --> 01:05:36.065
WHERE DO WE GET THE MONEY TO

01:05:36.132 --> 01:05:37.933
FUND THE FUND.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:38.567
RATE.

01:05:38.634 --> 01:05:39.769
DO WE HAVE THAT AS A PROPOSAL

01:05:39.835 --> 01:05:42.772
YET I THINK WE HAVE A PRETTY BIG

01:05:42.838 --> 01:05:46.075
RAINY DAY FUND RIGHT NOW -- IT.

01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:48.177
MAYBE MAYBE UP SOMETHING FROM

01:05:48.244 --> 01:05:49.745
THERE MAYBE THERE'S SOME OTHER

01:05:49.812 --> 01:05:51.814
RESOURCES I'M [inaudible]

01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:53.749
YOU KNOW.

01:05:53.816 --> 01:05:54.417
BUT YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT WE'RE

01:05:54.483 --> 01:05:55.718
NOT GONNA THE SALES PROCEEDS

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:56.786
BECAUSE THAT WAY I UNDERSTAND

01:05:56.852 --> 01:05:57.620
AFTER RIGHT YEAH I I UNDERSTAND

01:05:57.687 --> 01:05:58.821
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE

01:05:58.888 --> 01:06:02.291
TALKING ABOUT A HUGE HUGE AMOUNT.

01:06:02.358 --> 01:06:04.827
OF RESOURCES TO TO DO THAT WILL

01:06:04.894 --> 01:06:06.595
NOT DOES MY LAST PART BECAUSE

01:06:06.662 --> 01:06:07.697
YOU WERE SAYING LOW THESE ARE

01:06:07.763 --> 01:06:10.900
LOW COST IMPROVEMENTS.

01:06:10.966 --> 01:06:11.567
BUT IT SOUND TO ME LIKE FROM THE

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:12.702
FIRE MARSHALL NUMBER ONE WHAT WE

01:06:12.768 --> 01:06:15.538
NEED IS A NEW ROOF.

01:06:15.604 --> 01:06:16.305
AND THAT WHICH IS NOT ONE OF

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:17.340
THEM NEEDED OUR ASKING.

01:06:17.406 --> 01:06:19.375
FOR RIGHT.

01:06:19.442 --> 01:06:20.042
BUT THAT'S WHAT I GET TO IS LIKE

01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:20.710
A IT SEEMS LIKE THE MORE

01:06:20.776 --> 01:06:22.244
FUNDAMENTAL THINGS THAT WE NEED

01:06:22.311 --> 01:06:23.646
TO DO IS PEOPLE SHOULDN'T HAVE

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:25.448
WOOD SHAKE ROOFS MAYBE FOR

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:26.849
EXAMPLE THEY SHOULD HAVE.

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:28.217
BETTER ROOFS AND THAT WE NEED IN

01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:29.685
THE YOU NEED THAT PROTECTION FOR

01:06:29.752 --> 01:06:32.088
THE EVE SO THE EMBERS DON'T GET

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:32.621
IN.

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:33.723
IT'S NOT THOSE MIGHT BE MORE

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:38.694
COSTLY IMPROVEMENTS RIGHT.

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:41.097
IN THIS IS SAYING THAT AND IN

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:42.765
THOSE WOULDN'T BE REQUIRED YOUR

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:47.002
BILL RIGHT.

01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:49.205
TEST TEST THE REQUIREMENT -- FOR

01:06:49.271 --> 01:06:49.872
ROOFING STRUCTURES HAS BEEN IN

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:52.108
THE BUILDING CODE FOR I THINK

01:06:52.174 --> 01:06:54.310
THIRTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS --

01:06:54.377 --> 01:06:55.811
RELATIVE TO FIRE HAZARD TO VERY

01:06:55.878 --> 01:06:56.946
SOON AND ROOFING SO IT'S NOT AT

01:06:57.012 --> 01:06:57.880
ALL A NEW PROVISION.

01:06:57.947 --> 01:06:59.448
SO IF PEOPLE COME IN FOR A

01:06:59.515 --> 01:07:02.284
PERMIT NOW TO REPLACE THE ROSE.

01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:03.686
FOR THE LAST I BELIEVE FIFTEEN

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:04.687
YEARS IT MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY OFF

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:07.089
WE HAVE REQURED THE PROPER

01:07:07.156 --> 01:07:09.024
ROOFING ACCORDING TO FIRE HAZARD

01:07:09.091 --> 01:07:10.259
TO BE PRESENT THAT'S NOT UNTIL

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:11.727
YOU COME IN TO DO A NEW ROOF

01:07:11.794 --> 01:07:12.395
RIGHT I'M SOME CENTER THIS BILL

01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:16.432
IS GOING TO REQUIRE RETROFITS.

01:07:16.499 --> 01:07:18.100
RIGHT.

01:07:18.167 --> 01:07:18.834
A I DON'T I DON'T SEE IT

01:07:18.901 --> 01:07:19.635
REQUIRING SPECIFICALLY A ROUGH

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:20.736
I'M JUST SAYING THAT PEOPLE

01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:22.071
FREQUENTLY DO REPLACE THE REST

01:07:22.138 --> 01:07:23.839
BECAUSE IT IS A REPLACEABLE

01:07:23.906 --> 01:07:25.641
PORTION OF THE BUILDING ELEMENT --

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:27.076
AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING LIKE

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:30.045
EVENT -- THAT ARE NOT NORMALLY

01:07:30.112 --> 01:07:31.480
REPLACE SO I GUESS MY QUESTION

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:32.681
IN THE WORLD IF WE ARE GOING TO

01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:34.550
RETROFIT THESE STRUCTURES TO BE

01:07:34.617 --> 01:07:36.752
MORE SAFE AND FIRE RESILIENT.

01:07:36.819 --> 01:07:38.120
RIGHT AND IF THAT'S THE SPIRIT

01:07:38.187 --> 01:07:39.355
OF THIS IS OF COURSE SORT OF

01:07:39.422 --> 01:07:40.289
FORCE PEOPLE TO DO IT.

01:07:40.356 --> 01:07:43.025
RIGHT.

01:07:43.092 --> 01:07:43.659
RATHER THAN A RICH THAT WITHIN

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:45.528
SOME PERIOD OF TIME.

01:07:45.594 --> 01:07:46.896
WAS NOT THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE

01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:49.031
OR SAYING HEY BY TWENTY TWENTY

01:07:49.098 --> 01:07:50.566
FIVE YOU HAVE TO DO THIS RIGHT.

01:07:50.633 --> 01:07:54.603
THE THE GOAL -- AND IF ROOF

01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:56.939
ISN'T PART OF THAT.

01:07:57.006 --> 01:07:58.340
HAVE WE REALLY ACCOMPLISHED THE

01:07:58.407 --> 01:07:59.175
OBJECT BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE

01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:01.544
THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE THING YOU

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:03.179
NEED TO DO TO BE MORE FIRE.

01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:06.215
RIGHT.

01:08:06.282 --> 01:08:09.051
THE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE FUNDS.

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:10.986
FOR THE PEOPLE WOULD TAKE THAT.

01:08:11.053 --> 01:08:12.521
BUT THEN THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING

01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:13.956
TO FIGURE OUT ARE THEY THEN

01:08:14.023 --> 01:08:14.390
REQUEST LET'S SAY.

01:08:14.457 --> 01:08:16.225
LET'S SAY YOUR PERSON WHO

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:17.493
DOESN'T QUALIFY FOR THE FUND.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.561
RIGHT.

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:20.696
ARE YOU STILL BY TWENTY TWENTY

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:22.498
FIVE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE.

01:08:22.565 --> 01:08:24.300
THE NEW ROOF IN THESE OTHER

01:08:24.366 --> 01:08:29.505
REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT.

01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:30.940
THE NEW FOR YEAH THE NEW ROOF IS

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:32.641
NOT A REQUIREMENT BUT IT'S

01:08:32.708 --> 01:08:33.809
ELIGIBLE FOR THE LOAN OKAY BUT

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:35.177
THE LOW COST.

01:08:35.244 --> 01:08:37.179
RETROFITS WOULD BE REQUIRED IS

01:08:37.246 --> 01:08:38.514
THAT RIGHT YES AND I THINK I'LL

01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:40.382
GO BACK TO WHAT THE BUT THE

01:08:40.449 --> 01:08:44.987
CHAIR WAS TALKING ABOUT WHAT NOT

01:08:45.054 --> 01:08:45.621

YOU MAY BE MORE THAN ANY OF US

01:10:30.025 --> 01:10:31.994
HAVE SEEN -- WHAT DEVASTATION

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:34.797
LOOKS LIKE FIRST HAND -- I

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:36.298
ACTUALLY HAD A COUPLE OF

01:10:36.365 --> 01:10:38.400
QUESTIONS LAST YEAR AS YOU

01:10:38.467 --> 01:10:42.338
MENTIONED -- WE SAW THAT HIGH

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:44.273
RISK OR HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS OF

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:46.575
KIND OF EXPANDED -- THROUGHOUT

01:10:46.642 --> 01:10:48.177
THE SPEC OUT THROUGHOUT THE

01:10:48.243 --> 01:10:50.713
STATE -- GOING MORE PLACES AND

01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:53.616
WE KIND OF ARE NORMALLY AND

01:10:53.682 --> 01:10:54.750
THINKING THAT FIRES WOULD GO.

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:55.451
SO AS A RESULT OF THAT I'M

01:10:55.517 --> 01:10:57.386
WONDERING HOW WAS THE ONE

01:10:57.453 --> 01:11:00.155
BILLION DOLLAR NUMBER DETERMINED.

01:11:00.222 --> 01:11:02.958
AND HOW WILL YOU MANAGER MEASURE

01:11:03.025 --> 01:11:08.497
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LOAN --

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:09.565
WELL.

01:11:09.632 --> 01:11:11.133
IT'S IT'S HARD TO DETERMINE WHAT

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.702
THE ACTUAL NEED WILL BE AND MY

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:15.104
HOPE IS THAT -- THAT WOULD A

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:16.405
BILLION DOLLARS WILL BE ADEQUATE

01:11:16.472 --> 01:11:17.973
IT'S A REVOLVING LOAN FUND SO IF

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.309
IT'S IF IT'S NOT ENOUGH WILL

01:11:20.376 --> 01:11:21.510
KNOW FAIRLY QUICKLY IF IT'S TOO

01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:22.878
MUCH WILL KNOW FAIRLY QUICKLY AS

01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:29.818
WELL -- BUT IT SEEMS IT SEEMS

01:11:29.885 --> 01:11:30.386
LIKE AN APPROPRIATE NUMBER

01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:31.387
CONSIDERING.

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:32.655
THE KINDS A RETROFITS WE'RE

01:11:32.721 --> 01:11:36.892
LOOKING AT HOW.

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:38.127
HAS THE RUNNING IT THOUGHT GIVEN

01:11:38.193 --> 01:11:39.561
TO HOW TO MANAGEMENT MEASURE THE

01:11:39.628 --> 01:11:42.531
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LOAN I MEAN

01:11:42.598 --> 01:11:44.667
IS YOUR GOAL THAT A 100% OF THE

01:11:44.733 --> 01:11:46.268
MONEY WILL BE USED.

01:11:46.335 --> 01:11:47.870
OR THAT ARE YOU MEASURING IT

01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:50.272
BASED ON WHERE HOMEOWNERS ARE

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:52.975
LOCATED I MEAN IS THERE ANY

01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:53.409
THOUGHT GIVEN TO THE

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.244
EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT -- I WOULD

01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:55.911
I WOULD SAY THAT THE AND THE IF

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:57.513
HOPE HOPEFULLY THROUGH EDUCATION

01:11:57.579 --> 01:11:59.848
THROUGH THE REGIONAL THE

01:11:59.915 --> 01:12:01.517
REGIONAL -- GROUPS THAT WE'RE

01:12:01.583 --> 01:12:03.018
CREATING HERE THE TECHNICAL

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:05.421
ASSISTANCE THAT THE LOAN WILL BE

01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:07.122
WILL BE FULLY SUBSCRIBED -- THAT

01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:08.190
WOULD THAT WOULD BE THE GOAL AND

01:12:08.257 --> 01:12:09.858
SINCE IT'S A REVOLVING LOAN FUND

01:12:09.925 --> 01:12:11.460
OF PEOPLE WE PAYING BACK.

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:12.928
THEN THIS WILL CONTINUE TO HELP

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:14.430
FOR THE FUTURE LAND OWNERS AS WE

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:16.265
GO ALONG WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE

01:12:16.331 --> 01:12:17.966
THE MOST SEVERE AREAS IN THE

01:12:18.033 --> 01:12:20.502
STATE -- YOU KNOW IDEALLY

01:12:20.569 --> 01:12:21.970
WOULDN'T WE WANT TO HAVE ALL

01:12:23.372 --> 01:12:24.673
OF HAVE THESE KINDS OF

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:28.777
PROTECTIONS AS WELL -- BUT I

01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:29.545
THINK WILL YOU KNOW A LOT IS

01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:31.680
GOING TO BE EDUCATION CHANGES IN

01:12:31.747 --> 01:12:34.450
BEHAVIOR WHICH WE TYPICALLY FIND

01:12:34.516 --> 01:12:36.852
TO BE HARD THINGS TO ACCOMPLISH --

01:12:36.919 --> 01:12:38.353
BUT THEY'RE NECESSARY -- KNOW

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:39.788
THESE KINDS OF THINGS YOU KNOW A

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:41.290
DOLLAR YOU SPEND ON PREVENTION

01:12:41.356 --> 01:12:43.225
SAVES YOU FOUR DOLLARS ON THE

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:43.792
OTHER END.

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:45.127
THROUGHHAVING TO FIGHT A FIRE

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:47.830

LEARNING AS WE GO THROUGH THIS

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:47.636
PROCESS AND CERTAINLY I THINK WE

01:21:47.702 --> 01:21:49.671
CAN LEARN A LOT BY -- ONE

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:52.307
UTILIZING THIS REVOLVING -- FIND --

01:21:52.374 --> 01:21:54.242
FOR PEOPLE TO DRAW DOWN BUT

01:21:54.309 --> 01:21:55.844

CERTAINLY TO KNOW THAT THE STATE

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:19.834
IT GIVES THOSE INDIVIDUALS SOME

01:22:19.901 --> 01:22:21.603

01:22:30.345 --> 01:22:33.381
GO AND ALSO WITH THE COMMITTEE --

01:22:33.448 --> 01:22:34.983

01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:37.652
ASSUME THOSE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE

01:22:37.719 --> 01:22:39.721
LOCAL INDIVIDUALS -- WHO HAVE

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:41.289
FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE AND

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:43.091
EXPERTISE TO BE ABLE TO GUIDE

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:44.192
THE CONVERSATION TO WHERE IT

01:22:44.259 --> 01:22:45.894
NEEDS TO GO AS RELATES TO THIS

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:48.196
ANY OTHER ISSUES COMING UP

01:22:48.263 --> 01:22:49.230
CORRECT YOU'RE RIGHT ABSOLUTELY

01:22:49.297 --> 01:22:50.031

SO AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:22:55.136 --> 01:22:55.704
IT'S Y. ME THE MOST [inaudible]

01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:57.906
MR COOLEY.

01:22:57.972 --> 01:22:58.740
MISTER WHAT I WANT TO THANK YOU

01:22:58.807 --> 01:22:59.941
FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I

01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:01.643
JUST WANT TO OFFER SOME.

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:03.278
COMMENTS I MEAN I CAN SEE.

01:23:03.345 --> 01:23:04.379
HOW IF WE HAD A CLEAR SENSE OF

01:23:04.446 --> 01:23:05.747
DIRECTION?

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:06.848
YOU WOULD NEED TO PUT THESE

01:23:06.915 --> 01:23:07.982
PEOPLE TOGETHER YOU JUST SORT OF

01:23:08.049 --> 01:23:09.317
DO IT.

01:23:09.384 --> 01:23:11.953
BUT MY GENERAL SENSE IS WHEN YOU

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:15.357
LOOK AT THE WILDFIRE ISSUE.

01:23:15.423 --> 01:23:17.392
IN A IN A IN A DIFFERENT WAY IS

01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:19.060
NOT REALLY A FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY

01:23:19.127 --> 01:23:20.795
PROBLEM.

01:23:20.862 --> 01:23:22.197
I THINK YOU DEAL WITH A WILDLAND

01:23:22.263 --> 01:23:23.998
INTERFACE IT'S MORE OF AN AREA

01:23:24.065 --> 01:23:26.334
OF MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN HEAVY

01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:27.202
TIMBER.

01:23:27.268 --> 01:23:28.570
THESE ARE THE SORTS OF THINGS

01:23:28.636 --> 01:23:30.105
MAYBE CHAPARRAL.

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:32.240
INTENTION APPAREIL AREAS THIS IS

01:23:32.307 --> 01:23:34.809
NOT THE PREPONDERANCE OF WHERE

01:23:34.876 --> 01:23:36.444
CALIFORNIANS LIVE [inaudible]

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:40.515
AND WHATEVER IS HAPPENING

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:42.250
CLIMATE WISE I ACTUALLY FAVOR

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:43.618
SOMETHING BOLD ON THE PART OF

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:44.886
CALIFORNIA.

01:23:44.953 --> 01:23:48.022
SOMETHING LIKE A MARSHALL PLAN.

01:23:48.089 --> 01:23:48.890
SO DO WHERE IS WE IS AN ENTIRE

01:23:48.957 --> 01:23:50.592
STATE.

01:23:50.658 --> 01:23:52.160
IT KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:54.028
CALIFORNIA'S AT RISK. FOR

01:23:54.095 --> 01:23:56.197
REASONS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL

01:23:56.264 --> 01:23:56.698
THE DYNAMICS.

01:23:56.765 --> 01:23:58.800
AND WE START TRYING TO TACKLE

01:23:58.867 --> 01:24:00.235
THE PIECES OF WHICH WE CAN.

01:24:00.301 --> 01:24:02.036
I WANT TO SAY THIS IDEA OF

01:24:02.103 --> 01:24:04.205
TRYING TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC

01:24:04.272 --> 01:24:05.907
HARDING SORTS OF THINGS THIS IS

01:24:05.974 --> 01:24:08.243
NOT A UNIQUE CONVERSATION.

01:24:08.309 --> 01:24:08.843
IF YOU'RE IN FLORIDA IF YOU'RE

01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:10.178
ON THE IF YOU'RE ON THE GULF

01:24:10.245 --> 01:24:11.513
COAST.

01:24:11.579 --> 01:24:13.181
THE WHOLE ISSUE OF WHAT ARE THE

01:24:13.248 --> 01:24:14.716
PROJECT IMPROVES A CREMATED

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:17.051
HUMAN HOMES HUMAN HABITATION. TO

01:24:17.118 --> 01:24:19.287
MAKE IT MORE RESILIENT IN THE

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:20.422
FACE OF KNOWN THREAT.

01:24:20.488 --> 01:24:22.524
THIS IS SORT OF A STANDARD TOOL

01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:23.925
IN A TOOL KIT.

01:24:23.992 --> 01:24:25.593
THE THINK ABOUT HOW YOU DEAL

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:27.362
WITH THESE SORTS OF THINGS.

01:24:27.429 --> 01:24:28.997
ARM.

01:24:29.063 --> 01:24:31.900
HONESTLY I WHEN I LOOK AT THIS.

01:24:31.966 --> 01:24:34.469
OUR I VIEW THIS IS REALLY A

01:24:34.536 --> 01:24:35.470
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW DO FOR

01:24:35.537 --> 01:24:37.572
ALMOST FORTY MILLION

01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:39.274
CALIFORNIANS.

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:40.975
TACKLE A PROBLEM THAT IS.

01:24:41.042 --> 01:24:42.977
INCREASINGLY PARAMOUNT FOR A LOT

01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:45.447
OF OUR RURAL NEIGHBORS.

01:24:45.513 --> 01:24:45.980
HOW DO WE AS A STATE PULL

01:24:46.047 --> 01:24:47.582
TOGETHER?

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:49.217
AND IF IT DOES BECOME A RESOURCE

01:24:49.284 --> 01:24:52.287
QUESTION.

01:24:52.353 --> 01:24:53.054
BUT THERE IS NO DIFFERENT TO

01:24:53.121 --> 01:24:58.493
WHEN KEN MADDY.

01:24:58.560 --> 01:24:59.761
DID A HANDSHAKE DEAL AFTER LOMA

01:24:59.828 --> 01:25:01.863
PRIETA EARTHQUAKE.

01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:04.265
SO LET'S LET'S RAISE SALES TAXES

01:25:04.332 --> 01:25:06.100
SO WE CAN REBUILD THINGS THAT

01:25:06.167 --> 01:25:07.569
NEED TO BE RE REBUILT IN THE BAY

01:25:07.635 --> 01:25:09.471
AREA.

01:25:09.537 --> 01:25:11.139
YOU KNOW THAT'S MORE THE MODEL

01:25:11.206 --> 01:25:13.174
OF HOW GOVERNMENT'S WORKS.

01:25:13.241 --> 01:25:14.275
WERE THEN WITHIN THE AREA OF

01:25:14.342 --> 01:25:16.110
CALIFORNIA WE TRY TO TACKLE ARE

01:25:16.177 --> 01:25:21.483
PRESSING ISSUES -- SO WHY.

01:25:21.549 --> 01:25:22.917
I LOOK AT THIS I THINK WELL

01:25:22.984 --> 01:25:24.185
THERE'S A LOT OF OPEN ISSUES

01:25:24.252 --> 01:25:25.753
HERE FOR B. AS A LAWYER WHEN I

01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:27.021
READ THIS.

01:25:27.088 --> 01:25:28.223
HOWARD ENTER TWINED TO THE CIVIL

01:25:28.289 --> 01:25:29.757
CORD THE TRANSFER DISCLOSURE

01:25:29.824 --> 01:25:31.493
STATEMENT IT'S INTEGRATED AND

01:25:31.559 --> 01:25:33.027
EVERY WILL PROPERTY TRANSACTION.

01:25:33.094 --> 01:25:34.162
HOW DOES THIS DO WILD FIRE

01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:36.231
HAZARD JOAN INTEGRATE WITH LIKE

01:25:36.297 --> 01:25:38.566
THE ALL CHRIS PRIAL SEISMIC

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:40.902
DISTRICTS SEISMIC MAPPING ISSUES

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:42.070
WHAT'S THE NATURE THE

01:25:42.136 --> 01:25:44.506
CERTIFICATION THAT WE'RE DOING

01:25:44.572 --> 01:25:46.207
HERE?

01:25:46.274 --> 01:25:47.308
BUT I VIEW THIS IS THESE ARE

01:25:47.375 --> 01:25:48.409
SORT OF NEEDS THE PEOPLE CAN

01:25:48.476 --> 01:25:49.878
SORT OF FIGURE OUT HOW WOULD

01:25:49.944 --> 01:25:50.512
FIFTY SCENES TOGETHER.

01:25:50.578 --> 01:25:52.013
SURELY THERE'S A NEED FOR A

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:52.747
FUNDING STREAM BUT ACTUALLY

01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:53.047
[inaudible]

01:25:53.114 --> 01:25:54.983
YOU KNOW.

01:25:55.049 --> 01:25:56.784
THOSE OF US WHO ARE ELECTED IN

01:25:56.851 --> 01:25:57.886
TWENTY TWELVE OR NOW THE LONGEST

01:25:57.952 --> 01:26:00.021
SERVING LAWMAKERS IN THE HISTORY

01:26:00.088 --> 01:26:02.056
CONFERENCE LAST TWENTY YEARS.

01:26:02.123 --> 01:26:04.926
AND THOSE WITH THE WAR LIKE IN

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:05.560
TWENTY TWELVE RUN THAT SAME PATH

01:26:05.627 --> 01:26:06.261
YOURSELF.

01:26:06.327 --> 01:26:07.829
WE NEED TO BE WORKING ON HOW WE

01:26:07.896 --> 01:26:09.697
REINVENT THIS INSTITUTION TO

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:10.265
PULL TOGETHER FOR THE ENTIRE

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:11.966
STATE.

01:26:12.033 --> 01:26:13.868
AND AND TAKE A MORE LONG TERM

01:26:13.935 --> 01:26:15.537
VIEW OF ISSUES.

01:26:15.603 --> 01:26:16.704
AND THAT'S SORT OF SO I SORT OF

01:26:16.771 --> 01:26:18.406
THINK A BILL LIKE THIS IS

01:26:18.473 --> 01:26:21.075
CHALLENGING AS IT IS.

01:26:21.142 --> 01:26:22.176
IT'S SORT OF AN INVITATION TO

01:26:22.243 --> 01:26:24.178
HOW DO WE HOW DO WE GROW THE

01:26:24.245 --> 01:26:26.214
INSTITUTION. TO TAKE THIS MORE

01:26:26.281 --> 01:26:28.316
WIDE RANGING VIEW OF THE WHOLE

01:26:28.383 --> 01:26:31.119
STATE BEING AND THINGS TOGETHER.

01:26:31.185 --> 01:26:32.620
AND I ACTUALLY SAVE FOR THOSE OF

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:33.588
YOU THAT HAVE SOME DISCOMFORT

01:26:33.655 --> 01:26:34.989
WAS SORT OF THE CHARACTER

01:26:35.056 --> 01:26:36.257
POLITICAL DIALOGUE IN OUR

01:26:36.324 --> 01:26:39.093
COUNTRY. TO BE ABLE TO WRAP

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.295
AROUNDS RUN AN ISSUE THE

01:26:40.361 --> 01:26:42.363
AFFECTION TIRE STATE AND LOOK AT

01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:43.431
HOW THE WHOLE STATE WOULD PULL

01:26:43.498 --> 01:26:44.365
TOGETHER.

01:26:44.432 --> 01:26:45.800
IS ACTUALLY TAKEN OUR

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:48.436
GOVERNMENTS ARE INSTITUTION A

01:26:48.503 --> 01:26:50.004
VERY HEALTHY DIRECTION.

01:26:50.071 --> 01:26:51.105
AND I DON'T THINK THAT JUST

01:26:51.172 --> 01:26:53.975
BECAUSE YOU'RE.

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:55.643
YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUES FROM.

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:57.078
AN AIR THIS HAD RURAL

01:26:57.145 --> 01:26:58.613
DEVASTATION.

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:00.448
I THINK IT'S AN ISSUE THAT I

01:27:00.515 --> 01:27:01.983
ACTUALLY INTEND TO SUPPORT TODAY

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:03.451
AND I WOULD.

01:27:03.518 --> 01:27:04.018
URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO THINK

01:27:04.085 --> 01:27:05.153
ABOUT.

01:27:05.219 --> 01:27:06.721
BUT NOT EVERYONE HAS TO BE ON

01:27:06.788 --> 01:27:07.422
BOARD AT THIS TIME I MEAN I

01:27:07.488 --> 01:27:08.256
THINK.

01:27:08.323 --> 01:27:09.757
IT'S A TIME TO BE THINKING OUT

01:27:09.824 --> 01:27:10.692
LOUD.

01:27:10.758 --> 01:27:12.660
MOVING FORWARD.

01:27:12.727 --> 01:27:17.799
SO -- THE THE WHOLE ISSUE OF HOW

01:27:17.865 --> 01:27:19.200
YOU WOULD FINANCE A SORT OF

01:27:19.267 --> 01:27:20.868
THING BUT I SORT OF THINK.

01:27:20.935 --> 01:27:22.604
LIKE TO LOWER PUT EXAMPLE IF

01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:24.806
YOU'RE TARGETING A COMPARATIVE

01:27:24.872 --> 01:27:26.808
SMALL NUMBER OF FORTY MILLION

01:27:26.874 --> 01:27:28.610
CALIFORNIANS WITH A FIX.

01:27:28.676 --> 01:27:30.044
WILL SAY PUBLIC DOLLARS A LONG

01:27:30.111 --> 01:27:31.212
RUN.

01:27:31.279 --> 01:27:32.480
AND WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO

01:27:32.547 --> 01:27:33.748
START COMMITTED REVENUE STREAM

01:27:33.815 --> 01:27:35.416
TO THAT SORT OF MARSHALL PLAN

01:27:35.483 --> 01:27:39.020
IDEA -- ITS ADVANTAGES THE STATE

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:41.222
AS A WHOLE [inaudible]

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:43.224
ARM SO.

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:48.096
I I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS A YOU

01:27:48.162 --> 01:27:51.265
KNOW I LOOK AT THIS BILL -- AND

01:27:51.332 --> 01:27:52.433
I SEE THIS OFF WHEN I DRAFT

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.502
LEGISLATION MYSELF.

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:56.604
I PUT SOME IDEAS OUT THERE AND

01:27:56.671 --> 01:27:58.006
PEOPLE TAKE POT SHOTS AT AND I

01:27:58.072 --> 01:28:00.541
ALWAYS SAY.

01:28:00.608 --> 01:28:02.577
I LIKE TO I AM DOING WRONG BY

01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:03.177
THE WAY YOU'RE DOING IT NOT AT

01:28:03.244 --> 01:28:03.978
ALL.

01:28:04.045 --> 01:28:05.847
AND I LOOK AT THIS BILL MISTER

01:28:05.913 --> 01:28:07.548
WOULD AND I THINK I LIKED WE'RE

01:28:07.615 --> 01:28:09.317
DOING WRONG BY THE WAY I'M TO

01:28:09.384 --> 01:28:10.518
LEARN NOT AT ALL A KIND OF MOVES

01:28:10.585 --> 01:28:11.819
US ON A MORE COLLABORATIVE

01:28:11.886 --> 01:28:13.921
PROBLEM SOLVING BASIS IN THE

01:28:13.988 --> 01:28:15.023
WHOLE STATE.

01:28:15.089 --> 01:28:16.658
IT STARTS TO TARGET AREAS WHERE

01:28:16.724 --> 01:28:18.326
WE KNOW WE HAVE ISSUES AND

01:28:18.393 --> 01:28:19.627
FRANKLY FOR ME AS A DEMOCRAT IT

01:28:19.694 --> 01:28:22.063
SETS ME UP. TO REALLY RECKON

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:23.498
WITH ISSUES OF BY.

01:28:23.564 --> 01:28:26.134
MORE RURAL CALIFORNIANS AND

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.835
REMIND THEM THAT.

01:28:27.902 --> 01:28:29.137
THEY MAY FEEL THEY'RE FROM THE

01:28:29.203 --> 01:28:30.304
GREAT STATE OF JEFFERSON.

01:28:30.371 --> 01:28:31.773
BUT THE GREAT STATE OF

01:28:31.839 --> 01:28:33.441
CALIFORNIA HAS THEIR BACK.

01:28:33.508 --> 01:28:34.575
SO I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT SORT

01:28:34.642 --> 01:28:36.344
OF CONVERSATION TO HAVE IN OUR

01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:40.515
DAY THANK YOU.

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:45.253
LITTLE LEVITY.

01:28:45.319 --> 01:28:47.255
BUT NOT TO LIGHTEN THE POINT.

01:28:47.321 --> 01:28:48.756
OKAY IS THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:52.126

QUESTION.

01:42:57.804 --> 01:42:58.572
I DON'T THINK I'VE HAD THE

NOTHING NEW THAT I'VE BEEN

01:43:06.013 --> 01:43:07.848
WORKING ON THAT IN FACT A

01:43:07.915 --> 01:43:10.050
DIFFERENT VERSION OF THIS BILL --

01:43:10.117 --> 01:43:11.552
WAS HAD GONE TO THE GOVERNOR

01:43:11.618 --> 01:43:13.587
LAST YEAR AND WAS BE TOWED

01:43:13.654 --> 01:43:15.822
BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL COST --

01:43:15.889 --> 01:43:18.125
TO THE STATE -- SAID THIS WAS A

01:43:18.191 --> 01:43:20.694
REDO AND AN ATTEMPT TO LOOK AT

01:43:20.761 --> 01:43:21.995
IT DIFFERENT AND NOT PLACE THE

01:43:22.062 --> 01:43:25.933
BURDEN ON LOCAL JURISDICTIONS --

01:43:25.999 --> 01:43:27.167
IN FACT THIS ALSO.

01:43:27.234 --> 01:43:28.669
LESSEN THE NUMBER OF LOCAL

01:43:28.735 --> 01:43:31.471
JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE TO

01:43:31.538 --> 01:43:33.006

HAVE TO RESPOND TO THIS.

01:43:35.142 --> 01:43:37.911

01:43:37.978 --> 01:43:39.813
THE GENTLEMAN WAS SAYING PART OF

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:40.480
THE CHALLENGE.

01:43:40.547 --> 01:43:42.916
IS THAT BUT IF YOU DON'T IN SENT

01:43:42.983 --> 01:43:44.484
SOME OF THAT STILL LARGER CITIES

01:43:44.551 --> 01:43:46.019
HAVE ALREADY BEEN DOING THIS

01:43:46.086 --> 01:43:48.221
SIZE AS A STATE WE'RE ALREADY

01:43:48.288 --> 01:43:49.356

01:44:01.868 --> 01:44:03.670
