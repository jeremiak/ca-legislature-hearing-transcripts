LAST MINUTE IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW.

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:28.081
THAT -- THE THE PRIMARY

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:29.415
COMPONENT TO THIS BILL WERE

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:30.650
PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S

JANUARY BUDGET IN ADDITION THE

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:33.620
MAJORITY THE LANGUAGE BEFORE US

TODAY HAS BEEN POSTED.

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:36.489
ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:37.957
WEBSITE FOR MONTHS IN THESE

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:39.425
ISSUES WERE DISCUSSED.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.060
IN TE SUB COMMITTEE

00:02:41.127 --> 00:02:42.462
APPROXIMATELY TWO MONTHS AGO

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.464
WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:45.265
FOR THE MANY STATE

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.066
ADMINISTRATION TO PRESENT GOOD

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:49.102
MORNING GOOD AFTERNOON AFTERNOON

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:51.070
AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:52.105
I'M HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:53.940
CHAMBER ONE WHO'S THE HEAD OF

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:54.440
OUR REVENUE DEPARTMENT.

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:57.143
AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.211
WILL MAKE A COUPLE OF BRIEF.

00:02:58.278 --> 00:02:59.546
COMMENTS ABOUT THE BILL BEFORE

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:00.647
YOU AND THAT WE ARE HAPPY TO

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:02.015
TAKE ANY QUESTIONS.

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.616
THE FIRST QUESTION THAT I WANT

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:05.084
TO ANSWER IS WHY PASS A

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:06.419
CONFORMITY BILL AT ALL.

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:07.587
AND THEY'RE BASICALLY THREE

00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:09.489
REASONS FOR THIS THE FIRST IS

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:11.658
SIMPLICITY -- IT'S HARD ENOUGH

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:12.926
TO DO YOUR TAXES AND IT BECOMES

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:15.228
ESPECIALLY HARD WHEN YOU'RE

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:16.195
CALCULATING YOUR INCOME OR

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:18.031
DEDUCTIONS ONE WAY FOR FEDERAL

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:20.266
TAX PURPOSES AND ANOTHER WAY FOR

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:21.734
STATE TAX PURPOSES.

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:22.635
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.237
HAVE ONE SET OF RULES RATHER

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:26.039
THAN TWO IT MAKES SENSE TO

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:27.273
CONSIDER SOME OF THOSE CHANGES

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.675
AND THOSE ARE THE CHANGES BEFORE

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:29.742
YOU.

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.811
THE SECOND REASON IS FOR CLARITY

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:32.912
OFTEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE FILLING

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:34.647
OUT THEIR TAXES AND THERE ARE

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.215
DIFFERENT SETS OF RULES THAT MAY

00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:37.317
MAKE ERRORS THOSE ERRORS ARE

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:39.719
COSTLY THEY TAKE TIME TO RECTIFY

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.154
OFTEN THE RESULT IN PENALTIES

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.589
FROM STATE OR FEDERAL TAX

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:43.489
AGENCIES.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:44.824
SO WHEN YOU CONFORM WITH THE

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:45.491
FEDERAL TAX CODE ON CERTAIN

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:48.094
PROVISIONS IT REDUCES THE

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:48.695
PROBABILITY OF THOSE TYPES OF

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:49.128
ERRORS.

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:51.197
AND THEN THE THIRD REASON IS

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:53.132
POLICY -- MAKING CONFIRM THE

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.967
CHANGES THAT ARE PRUDENT OR

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:55.234
LOGICAL WE DON'T GENERALLY

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:56.703
REVISIT OUR TAX CODE EVERY YEAR

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:57.670
BUT EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:58.905
INCLUDING WHEN THE FEDERAL

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:00.106
GOVERNMENT MAKE SOME CHANGES.

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:01.608
THAT IS OFTEN THE TIME FOR THE

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:03.076
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:04.711
LOOK AT THE TAX CODE AND CLOSE

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:06.446
ANY LOOPHOLES MAKE ANY CHANGES

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:08.448
TO PROTECT INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:09.582
BUSINESSES.

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:11.751
ARE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:13.419
AND WE BELIEVE THE BILL BEFORE

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:18.391
YOU DOES ALL THESE THINGS.

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:20.026
INCLUDING AN EXPANSION OF THE

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:20.760
EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WHICH

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:21.961
WE THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT

00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:22.462
PARTICULARLY FOR WORKING

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:23.529
FAMILIES LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:24.664
FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA.

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:25.331
SO WHAT WE'LL DO NOW IS --

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:26.366
BRIEFLY WALK THROUGH SOME OF

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:27.533
THESE ITEMS -- AND HAPPY TO TAKE

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.369
ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ON THEM --

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:30.503
THAT'S ALL SEPARATE THEM INTO

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.704
TWO CATEGORIES THERE THOSE

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.072
PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL THAT

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.607
INCREASE REVENUE FOR THE STATE

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:35.308
ON NET.

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:36.743
AND THOSE PROVISIONS THAT

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:38.544
DECREASE REVENUE BUT ARE NONE

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:40.313
THE LESS GOOD PUBLIC POLICY. TO

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.347
THE PROVISIONS THAT INCREASE

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:42.882
REVENUE ARE LIMITING THAT

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.684
BUSINESS LOSSES THAT INDIVIDUALS

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:46.886
CAN TAKE TO OFFSET THEIR OTHER

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.388
INCOME I SEE NOTING A PORTENT

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:49.689
FACT ABOUT THIS PROVISION.

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:51.290
IT ONLY LIMITS BUSINESS LOSSES

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:53.559
IN EXCESS OF FIVE HUNDRED

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:54.127
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR MARRIED

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:55.895
COUPLES SO THIS ONLY IMPACTS YOU

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.597
IF YOU HAVE OVER HALF A MILLION

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.866
DOLLARS OF WAGES OR OTHER

00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:01.401
CAPITAL INCOME MORE INTERESTING

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:03.036
COMES TO OFFSET WITH ANY

00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:04.037
BUSINESS LOSSES.

00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:06.639
WE ALSO APPLY THE SAME FIVE

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:07.707
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR -- CAP

00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:08.474
FOR MARRIED COUPLES TO OUR

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:10.043
LIMITS TO LIKE KIND EXCHANGES

00:05:10.109 --> 00:05:11.611
AGAIN HERE CONFORMING WITH

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:13.579
FEDERAL LAW THIS IS A PROVISION

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:15.314
WHEN PEOPLE SELL A PRODUCTIVE

00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:15.948
ASSETS.

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:17.583
AND PURCHASE ANOTHER ASSET THERE

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.153
OFTEN ABLE TO DEFER TAXES RATHER

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:21.688
THAN PAYING TAXES ON THAT GAME --

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:22.955
WE PROPOSE CONFORMING TO THE

00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:24.524
FEDERAL PROBATION AND NOT

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.792
ALLOWING THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION

00:05:25.858 --> 00:05:28.361
OF REAL PROPERTY -- IF YOU HAVE

00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:29.028
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OR

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:30.063
MORE IN INCOME.

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.031
WE ALSO ELIMINATE THE USE OF NET

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:34.767
OPERATING LOSS CARRY BACKS WE

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.102
ENSURE THAT BANK BIG BANKS THAT

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.470
ARE PAYING PREMIUMS FOR THE

00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:38.638
FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:39.972
CORPORATION FDIC.

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:41.574
IF THEY HAVE MORE THAN FIFTY

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:42.842
BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS THEY

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:43.676
SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DEDUCT

00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:46.045
THOSE PREMIUMS AND NOT PAY TAXES

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:48.047
ON THOSE PAYMENTS WE CLOSE THE

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:49.615
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION WILL POLL

00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:51.317
WHICH PREVIOUSLY ALLOWED.

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:52.785
COMPANIES THAT PAY THEIR CEOS IN

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.353
EXCESS OF A MILLION DOLLARS TO

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.122
DEDUCT THAT COMPENSATION BY

PERFORMANCE BASED COMPENSATION.

00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:01.094
AND WE CONFORM TO SOME NEW

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.395
FEDERAL RULES AROUND THE

00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:03.629
TECHNICAL TERMINATION OF

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:05.998
PARTNERSHIPS AND SECTION THREE

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:06.999
THIRTY EIGHT ELECTIONS WHICH ARE

00:06:07.066 --> 00:06:08.267
OFTEN USED FOR MERGERS AND

00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:09.736
ACQUISITIONS IN THAT CASE ALSO

00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:10.803

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:27.814
CORPORATION WOULD HAVE TO HAVE

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.081
AN ENTIRE DEPARTMENT OR EVEN A

THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:47.300

00:07:55.474 --> 00:07:56.242
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE BOOKS

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.876

FAIRLY SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:03.683
AND THEN OFF TO A COMPLICATED.

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:06.018
SET OF CALCULATIONS TO DO THEIR

00:08:06.085 --> 00:08:07.220

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:08.521

EATING EAST BY CONFORMITY.

00:08:14.627 --> 00:08:18.998
SO FIRST OF ALL -- WHAT THIS

00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:19.799
WOULD DO AND AND WHAT IT DOESN'T

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:20.366
GENERALLY IS IT RAISES THE

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:22.869
THRESHOLD? FOR HOW MUCH GROCERY

RULE RIGHT NOW IS FIVE MILLION

00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:34.146
DOLLARS OF GROSS RECEIPTS -- AND

00:08:34.213 --> 00:08:36.449
THIS THIS CONFORMITY WOULD RAISE

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:40.887
THAT THRESHOLD TO TWENTY FIVE A

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:41.487
TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF

TO FIND WITH WITH FIVE MILLION

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:48.828

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME AND

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:55.501
EXPENSES RATHER THAN HAVE TO

00:08:55.568 --> 00:08:56.736
LOOK AT COMPLICATED A CRUEL

00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:57.603
RULES.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.705
THEY CAN SIMPLY A CREW THE

00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:01.674
EXPENSES AND THE INCOME OR ARE

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:03.009
THEY ARE COUNTY.

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:04.377
EXPENSES IN THE INCOME WHEN THEY

00:09:04.443 --> 00:09:06.512
ACTUALLY OCCUR AND NOT WORRY

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:07.580
ABOUT.

00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:08.514
YOU WOULD WAS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:10.883
MOST WORK COMPLETED IN AND IT IS

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.186
A INCOME RELY -- LIKELY TO COME

00:09:14.253 --> 00:09:17.924
ALL THOSE THIS IS A VERY CRUEL

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:22.461
RULES -- SO AND IN ADDITION OF

00:09:22.528 --> 00:09:24.030
IN ADDITION TO A CRUEL VERSUS

00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:28.367
CASH ACCOUNTING -- THERE'S THE

00:09:28.434 --> 00:09:29.969
HOW DO THE WAY THE YOU CALCULATE

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:33.639
COST COULD SOLD -- RIGHT NOW YOU

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:35.174
WHEN YOU -- MOST MOST BUSINESSES

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:36.575
OR LARGE BUSINESSES HAVE TO

00:09:36.642 --> 00:09:37.543
COUNT FOR COSTS COULD SOLD.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:38.611
BY LOOKING AT WHAT THEY ACTUALLY

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:41.714
PURCHASED AND THEN COMPARING THE

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:44.116
BEGINNING AND ENDING VALUE OF

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:46.185
THEIR OF THEIR INVENTORY

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:46.485
[inaudible]

00:09:46.552 --> 00:09:48.487
NOW.

00:09:48.554 --> 00:09:50.523
TOM HOW YOU ACTUALLY DO THAT HOW

00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:51.457
YOU ACTED TO COUNT FOR THE VALUE

00:09:51.824 --> 00:09:53.592
OF YOUR INVENTORY CAN BE

00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:55.528
SO WHAT THIS DOES IS IT SIMPLY

00:09:55.594 --> 00:09:58.364
SAYS FOR FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.

00:09:58.431 --> 00:09:59.298
WHICH AGAIN WOULD BE BUSINESS

00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:01.300
WITH -- INCOME UP TO TWENTY FIVE

00:10:01.367 --> 00:10:02.935
MILLION DOLLARS YOU SIMPLY HAVE

00:10:03.002 --> 00:10:04.770
TO LOOK WHICH PURCHASES ARE.

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:06.172
AND THEIR OTHER THING SEARCHES

00:10:06.238 --> 00:10:07.807
ALL HOW YOU TREAT LONG TERM

00:10:07.873 --> 00:10:13.479
CONTRACTS AND HOW YOU CAPITALIZE.

00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:16.882
YOU'RE THE THE COST INCLUDED IN

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:18.184
IN IN PRODUCING PRODUCTS THAT

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.286
YOU'RE GOING TO SELL SO IN ALL

00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:22.054
THEIR IN THERE ARE -- THERE ARE

00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:22.621
FIVE DIFFERENT RULES OF THIS

00:10:22.688 --> 00:10:23.990
AFFECTS.

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:25.057
THAT WILL MAKE -- MAKE

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:26.826
BOOKKEEPING A LOT EASIER FOR

00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:28.094
SMALL TEXTURES IN ADDITION IT

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.596
TENDS TO LOWER THE TAX LIABILITY

00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:33.032
WHICH IS WHY -- THIS IS COURT AS

00:10:33.099 --> 00:10:36.035
AS A REVENUE LOSS IT DID.

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:38.170
YEAH FIVE THAT'S GREAT AND AND

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:39.839
WE KNOW THAT A THE REASON THE

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:40.740
BUDGET YEAR THESE PROVISIONS

00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:42.408
THAT MY COLLEAGUES SPEAKING

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:45.077
ABOUT WILL SCORE REVENUE LOSS OF

00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:45.611
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:46.812
DOLLARS SO IT'S CERTAINLY NOT

00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:48.547
CHEAP BUT WE BELIEVE AS PART OF

00:10:48.614 --> 00:10:49.815
THIS CONFORMITY PACKAGE.

00:10:49.882 --> 00:10:51.384
IN MAKES A LOT OF SENSE -- FOR

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.319
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND PEOPLE

00:10:53.386 --> 00:10:54.520
WHO WORK IN SMALL BUSINESSES.

00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:56.122
I'LL COVE ONE LAST POINT --

00:10:56.188 --> 00:10:57.757
WHICH IS A QUESTION THAT WE

00:10:57.823 --> 00:10:59.759
SOMETIMES RECEIVE WHICH IS --

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:01.360
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID AND

00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:02.261
WE'VE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:04.196
FOLKS THIS FEDERAL TAX BUILDER A

00:11:04.263 --> 00:11:05.831
LOT OF THINGS IN IT THAT A LOT

00:11:05.898 --> 00:11:07.033
OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE.

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:08.300
SO WHY CONFORM TO DISPEL IN

00:11:08.367 --> 00:11:09.869
PARTICULAR AND OUR ANSWER TO

00:11:09.935 --> 00:11:11.537
THAT IS TWO FOLD THE FIRST IS

00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:13.005
THAT THIS IS NOT A FULL

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:14.040
CONFORMITY WITH ALL THE

00:11:14.106 --> 00:11:15.808
PROVISIONS WERE ONLY CONFORMING

00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:16.776
TO THOSE PROVISIONS.

00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:18.744
THAT MAKES THESE SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:20.246
AS ALL OF YOU KNOW FOR THE

00:11:20.312 --> 00:11:22.281
FEDERAL TAX BILL HAD A CAP ON

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:23.082
THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX

00:11:23.149 --> 00:11:24.817
DEDUCTION WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT

00:11:24.884 --> 00:11:26.185
DOING IN THIS CONFORMITY PACKAGE

00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:27.386
ANYTHING RELATED TO THAT IN

00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:28.687
TERMS OF THE DEDUCTIBILITY.

00:11:28.754 --> 00:11:30.589
OF LOCAL TAXES BUT WHEN IT COMES

00:11:30.656 --> 00:11:32.725
TO CLOSING LOOPHOLES THAT ALLOW

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:34.293
PEOPLE TO USE BUSINESS LOSSES TO

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.461
OFFSET KNOWING THAT DOLLARS IN

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.129
INCOME AND IN SOME CASES NOT PAY

00:11:37.196 --> 00:11:39.465
ANY TAXES AT ALL WHERE AS YOU

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:40.399
AND I ARE PAYING TAXES ON OUR

00:11:40.466 --> 00:11:40.900
WAGES.

00:11:40.966 --> 00:11:42.268
THAT'S A LOOPHOLE THAT WE FEEL

00:11:42.334 --> 00:11:43.803
COMFORTABLE CLOSING AND

00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:44.703
CONFORMING WITH THE FEDERAL

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:45.271
ACTION.

00:11:45.337 --> 00:11:47.239
AND THEN THE SECOND IS THE USE

00:11:47.306 --> 00:11:49.308
OF THE REVENUE AND GET THE

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:52.211
FEDERAL TAX -- LEVEL THEY CLOSED

00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:53.212
SOME THESE WILL POLLS BUT USE

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:53.746
THE REVENUE FOR THEIR OWN

00:11:53.813 --> 00:11:55.381
PURPOSES HERE WERE PROPOSING

00:11:55.448 --> 00:11:57.016
SPECIFICALLY TO PUT THE REVENUE

00:11:57.083 --> 00:11:58.150
INTO THE EARNED INCOME TAX

00:11:58.217 --> 00:11:59.585
CREDIT WHICH HELPS FAMILIES ALL

00:11:59.652 --> 00:12:01.187

THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND TO

00:12:04.457 --> 00:12:06.859
THE EXTENT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO

00:12:06.926 --> 00:12:07.359
BE VERY CAREFUL WITH OUR

00:12:07.426 --> 00:12:08.661
ESTIMATES. TO THE EXTENT THERE

00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:10.729
IS ANY ACCESS REVENUE AFTER WE

00:12:10.796 --> 00:12:13.332

WE WANT TO SPEND THEN ONE POINT

00:12:45.698 --> 00:12:47.199
SIX TO TWO BILLION THEN SO UNDER

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:49.201
AT THIS BILL WE WOULD ESTIMATE

ONE POINT SIX BILLION BUT SOME

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:12.191
OF THAT HAS TO DO SIMPLY WITH

00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:13.459
THE TIMING OF THIS PACKAGE IN MY

00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:14.360
CALL I CAN.

00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:16.629
SPEAK ABOUT THAT OVER THE LONGER

00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:18.397
TERM WERE EXPECTING ONE POINT

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:20.299

REVENUE.

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:23.135

MILLION TO SET ASIDE AND THE

00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:25.271
BUDGET.

00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:28.274
WHY ARE WE DOING?

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.609
A TAX INCREASE TO WE WE WE COULD

00:13:30.676 --> 00:13:31.577
HAVE PAID FOR IT RIGHT OUT OF

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:33.979
THAT. TWENTY ONE AND A HALF

00:13:34.046 --> 00:13:35.514
BILLION I'M I I'M JUST CURIOUS.

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:36.615
TO WE FELT MOST OF THAT TWENTY

00:13:36.682 --> 00:13:37.850
ONE AND A HALF BILLION IS ONE

00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:39.652
TIME AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE

00:13:39.718 --> 00:13:42.354
EITC -- THE T. C. THAT HAS BEEN

00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:43.556
AROUND AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR

00:13:43.622 --> 00:13:45.191
SEVERAL YEARS AT THE FEDERAL

00:13:45.257 --> 00:13:47.059
LEVEL FOR SEVERAL DECADES.

00:13:47.126 --> 00:13:48.327
AND WE SEE THIS AS A PROGRAM

00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:49.895
THAT NOT ONLY IS IMPORTANT

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:51.163
GENERALLY ON GOING BUT WHEN

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.531
THERE IS.

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:54.934
SOME TYPE OF FISCAL DISASTER OF

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.435
AND THAT'S WHEN PEOPLE OFTEN ARE

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:57.369
RELYING ON THESE TYPES OF

00:13:57.436 --> 00:13:59.838
PROGRAMS EVEN MORE SO WE WANT TO

00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:01.707
PUT IT ON AS SOUND A PHYSICAL

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:02.975
BASIS AS POSSIBLE.

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:04.076
AND THEN LAST QUESTION THE

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:07.179
PERSONAL LIKE KIND EXCHANGE

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:09.915
RULES.

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:13.152
WE'RE GETTING RID OF FOUGHT TO

00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:14.853
PUSH BACK FROM AUTO MAKERS.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.021
WHO WHAT SHOULD OUR RESPONSE BE?

00:14:16.088 --> 00:14:16.655
TO BASICALLY I THINK THERE ARE A

00:14:16.722 --> 00:14:17.556
COUPLE THINGS THAT YOU COULD SAY

00:14:17.623 --> 00:14:18.624
NUMBER ONE IS THAT.

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.059
VERY BROADLY THIS IS THE SAME

00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:21.794
CHANGE THAT WE ARE SEEING AT THE

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.262
FEDERAL LEVEL SO WE'RE SIMPLY

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:25.231
ADOPTING THEIR RULES AND FACTS

00:14:25.297 --> 00:14:26.432
ARE RULES ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:14:26.498 --> 00:14:27.700
LOOK RELAXED AND THERE IS

00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:28.767
BECAUSE WE ARE SAYING.

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:30.636
THIS ONLY APPLIES TO YOU IF YOU

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:32.671
HAD IN COMMON OF HALF A MILLION

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:33.539
DOLLARS OR MORE IF YOU'RE

00:14:33.606 --> 00:14:34.907
MARRIED WHEREAS AT THE FEDERAL

00:14:34.974 --> 00:14:36.275
LEVEL THERE IS NO LIMIT BUT

00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:37.643
EXCEPT WITH THE EXCEPTION FOR

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.111
REAL PROPERTY WHICH WE ALSO

00:14:39.178 --> 00:14:39.912
ADOPT.

00:14:39.979 --> 00:14:40.980
SOMETHING THAT'S ONE THING YOU

00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:42.948
CAN SAY I THINK THE SECOND THING

00:14:43.015 --> 00:14:44.416
IS WE DON'T SEE THIS NECESSARILY

00:14:44.483 --> 00:14:46.485
HAVING A LARGE IMPACT ON THE

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:48.520
LEASING OR VEHICLE MARKET AND MY

00:14:48.587 --> 00:14:50.389
COLLEAGUES HAPPY TO TALK.

00:14:50.456 --> 00:14:51.490
MORE ABOUT THAT.

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:52.825
AND THEN I THINK THE THIRD IS

00:14:52.891 --> 00:14:55.327
THAT GENERALLY THE REASON THAT

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:56.362
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADOPTED

00:14:56.428 --> 00:14:58.130
THIS ROLE AND THE REASON THAT WE

00:14:58.197 --> 00:14:59.465
ARE ADOPTING A VERSION OF IT.

00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:01.300
IS WHEN YOU TO SELL A PRODUCTIVE

00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:03.135
ASSETS TAX SHOULD BE DUE ON IT

00:15:03.202 --> 00:15:05.404
SO WHEN YOU'RE NOT PAYING TAXES

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:06.872
ON IT THOUGH THAT'S TAX REVENUE

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:08.173
THAT SOMEBODY ELSE HAS TO PAY SO

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:08.707
WE THINK.

00:15:08.774 --> 00:15:09.875
THIS IS REALLY THE FAIREST

00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:11.744
POLICY HERE I SHOULD ALSO NOTE

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.279
SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO AUTO

00:15:13.345 --> 00:15:15.347
MAKERS THAT WE DISCUSSED OUR CAP

00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:17.316
AND TRADE PROGRAM LAST WEEK IN

00:15:17.383 --> 00:15:17.950
COMMITTEE.

00:15:18.017 --> 00:15:18.884
AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:19.952
PROGRAMS TOTALING HUNDREDS OF

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:21.186
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT ARE

00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:22.688
DESIGNED TO SUPPORT.

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:24.123
THE INDUSTRY AND THE

00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:27.893
INTRODUCTION OF CLEAN VEHICLES

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.462

THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER --

00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:33.532

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:36.869
AN ACCOUNTANT.

00:15:36.935 --> 00:15:38.437
NORA MY TAX LAWYER.

00:15:38.504 --> 00:15:39.972
BUT SOMEONE ASSERTED WITH

00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:40.839
RESPECT TO THIS AUTO MOTOR

00:15:40.906 --> 00:15:43.475
VEHICLE LEASING SITUATION THAT.

00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:45.644
ON THE FEDERAL SIDE WITH THE THE

00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:47.446
REQUIREMENT THAT DEPRECIATION

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:49.114
CAPITAL GAIN LOSS BE RECOGNIZED

00:15:49.181 --> 00:15:52.885
ON THE TRANSFER OF THE OF THE

00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:54.987
FORMALLY LIKE KIND S. SENATE.

00:15:55.054 --> 00:15:56.755
ON THE FEDERAL SIDE THERE'S NOW

00:15:56.822 --> 00:15:57.956
BEEN BUILT IN AND MEETING THE

00:15:58.023 --> 00:15:59.558
MEDIA EXPENSE PROVISION THAT

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:00.526
ALLOWS.

00:16:00.592 --> 00:16:02.594
ON THE ACQUISITION OF THE NEW S.

00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:04.063
AT THAT THE VALUE BE IMMEDIATELY

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:05.564
EXPRESSED I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:08.233
TRUE OR NOT BUT IF THAT'S TRUE.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.401
THEN THAT CREATES A LITTLE WE'VE

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:10.669
WE'VE TAKEN ONE SIDE OF TAX

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:12.938
CONFORMITY BUT NOT THE OTHER

00:16:13.005 --> 00:16:14.540
SIDE IS THAT TRUE.

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:16.175
SO I CAN SPEAK REFER TO THAT AND

00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:20.079
JAY AT YOU CAN SO SO IT IS.

00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:20.846
THE CONFORMITY PACKAGE AS I

00:16:20.913 --> 00:16:21.680
MENTIONED IS A PARTIAL

00:16:21.747 --> 00:16:22.948
CONFORMITY PACKAGE SO WE'RE NOT

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:24.516
CONFORMING TO EVERYTHING AND I

00:16:24.583 --> 00:16:25.584
THINK.

00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:26.852
SOME PEOPLE COULD LOOK AT OUR

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:28.020
CONFORMITY PACKAGE AND SAY HEY

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:29.755
YOU ARE TAKING THIS ITEM BUT NOT

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:30.956
THAT ITEM AND THAT IS.

00:16:31.023 --> 00:16:33.325
BROADLY TRUE FOR EXAMPLE THAT

00:16:33.392 --> 00:16:34.493
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.261
THE LARGE -- PART OF THEIR TAX

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:37.963
REFORM WAS A VERY BIG CORPORATE

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.666
TAX CUTS AND YOU CAN SEE IN OUR

00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:42.267
PACKAGE WE DO NOT CAUGHT THE

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:43.469
STATE CORPORATE TAX RATE.

00:16:43.535 --> 00:16:45.604
SO WHAT WE BASICALLY DECIDED THE

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.239
ADMINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR IS

00:16:47.306 --> 00:16:49.308
THAT IT MAKES SENSE TO SAY THAT

00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:50.175
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF REAL

00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:51.744
PROPERTY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:52.878
THEY DID AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:55.848
WHEN YOU SELL AN ASSET JUST

00:16:55.914 --> 00:16:56.582
BECAUSE YOU'RE BUYING ANOTHER?

00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:57.483
ONE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEFER

00:16:57.549 --> 00:16:59.284
YOUR TAXES ON THAT SALE AND

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:00.686
OFTEN THERE IS A GAME HERE

00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:02.521
BECAUSE THAT ASSET EVEN THOUGH

00:17:02.588 --> 00:17:04.189
IT HAS SIGNIFICANT VALUE HAS

00:17:04.256 --> 00:17:05.657
BEEN DEPRECIATED A LOT.

00:17:05.724 --> 00:17:07.659
UNDER EXISTING RULES OFTENTIMES

00:17:07.726 --> 00:17:09.094
OR SOMETIMES DEPENDING ON THE

00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:11.463
INDUSTRY ALL THE WAY DOWN TO

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.465
ZERO SO PEOPLE ARE DEPRECIATING

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:14.933
OR EXPENSING AT THE FEDERAL

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.635
LEVEL -- THEY GET THE FULL

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:18.237
DEDUCTION AND THEN WHEN THEY

00:17:18.303 --> 00:17:19.638
SELL THE ASSET THEY WANT THE

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:20.506
SAME LIKE KIND EXCHANGE

00:17:20.572 --> 00:17:22.341
TREATMENT AT THE STATE LEVEL WE

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:24.276
DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THAT

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:25.210
MAKES SENSE THE WORKERS WERE

00:17:25.277 --> 00:17:28.747
ASSUMING THAT TRANSACTION IS AT

00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:29.982
THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL.

00:17:30.048 --> 00:17:31.383
AS OPPOSED TO FORD MOTOR CREDIT

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:32.351
OR GM.

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:34.253
CREDIT AND AND I DON'T PROFESS

00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:35.187
TO UNDERSTAND HOW THOSE

00:17:35.254 --> 00:17:36.555
ARRANGEMENTS WORK.

00:17:36.622 --> 00:17:38.056
BUT IF IN FACT YOU WILL YOU

00:17:38.123 --> 00:17:40.359
FORCED DEPRECIATION GAIN AND

00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:41.960
LOSS RECOGNITION.

00:17:42.027 --> 00:17:43.629
AND YOU DO NOT ALLOW ME X.

00:17:43.695 --> 00:17:46.298
EXPENSING OF THE OF THE NEWLY

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:47.633
ACQUIRED A SAID I COULD SEE HOW

00:17:47.699 --> 00:17:49.835
THAT MIGHT FROM A NON TAX LAWYER

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:51.336
NOT ACCOUNT STANDPOINT.

00:17:51.403 --> 00:17:52.871
DRIVE UP THE COST OF THE LEASE

00:17:52.938 --> 00:17:54.540
PACKAGE WHICH WOULD INTENT OF

00:17:54.606 --> 00:17:55.641
WHICH WOULD IN TURN.

00:17:55.707 --> 00:17:57.309
PERHAPS BE PASSED ON TO THE

00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:59.311
CONSUMER LISTEN I'M GOING TO

00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:01.213
SUPPORT THIS TODAY.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.514
MY CONCERN IS WITH THAT WAS WITH

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:04.283
ITEM TEN ON ORIGINS A LIKE KIND

00:18:04.349 --> 00:18:05.551
EXCHANGE IS AND I'M CONCERNED

00:18:05.617 --> 00:18:07.352
ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON

00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:08.220
OUR STATE.

00:18:08.287 --> 00:18:10.022
ELECTRIC VEHICLE PROGRAMS WHICH

00:18:10.088 --> 00:18:11.256
YOU KNOW AND MY COLLEAGUES KNOW

00:18:11.323 --> 00:18:13.292
WE'VE SPENT  AN AWFUL LOT OF

00:18:13.358 --> 00:18:14.226
TIME AND ATTENTION.

00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:16.295
ON SINCE I FIRST JOINED THIS

00:18:16.361 --> 00:18:18.497
HOUSE IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN

00:18:18.564 --> 00:18:21.500
SO.

00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:22.434
AS THIS BILL.

00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:23.268
PROBABLY MOVES OUT OF HERE AND

00:18:23.335 --> 00:18:24.703
MOVES ON AND AFTER I WOULD ASK

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.438
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WORK

00:18:26.505 --> 00:18:27.973
WITH THE GLOBAL AUTO

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.708
MANUFACTURERS TO SEE IF WE CAN

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:31.043
ADDRESS.

00:18:31.109 --> 00:18:33.679
ANY POTENTIAL ADVERSE IMPACT.

00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:36.181
ON OUR STATE ELECTRIC VEHICLE.

00:18:36.248 --> 00:18:38.083
LEASING PROGRAMS BECAUSE YOU'D

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:39.918
IF THE PRICE OF A BOLT IS GOING

00:18:39.985 --> 00:18:41.153
TO GO FROM EIGHTY NINE DOLLARS A

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.589
MONTH 220-023-0020 NINE DOLLARS

00:18:43.655 --> 00:18:45.624
A MONTH TO FOUR HUNDRED AND

00:18:45.691 --> 00:18:46.992
TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH.

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:48.560
THAT MIGHT DRIVE DOWN.

00:18:48.627 --> 00:18:49.962
THE NUMBER OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES

00:18:50.028 --> 00:18:52.397
THAT WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO ROLL

00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:54.233
OUT OUR ROADS WHICH WOULD.

00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:56.201
BE SORT OF COUNTER TO OUR STATE

00:18:56.268 --> 00:18:58.070
POLICIES HERE I'M NOT SAYING

00:18:58.136 --> 00:18:59.505
IT'S TRUE BUT I'M ASKING THE

00:18:59.571 --> 00:19:01.340
ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE A LOOK AT

00:19:01.406 --> 00:19:02.274
THAT WITH THE OTTOMAN

00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:04.710
MANUFACTURES TO SEE IF IN FACT.

00:19:04.776 --> 00:19:07.012
THE FAILURE TO INCLUDE IMMEDIATE

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:09.381
EXPENSING IF TRUE WILL HAVE HAS

00:19:09.448 --> 00:19:10.382
AN IMPACT ON THESE LEASE

00:19:10.449 --> 00:19:12.284
ARRANGEMENTS THANK YOU MANAGER

00:19:12.351 --> 00:19:15.554

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR

00:19:16.755 --> 00:19:18.156
PRESENTATION AND NOW I'M ON MY

00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:20.125
FAMILY WERE SMALL BUSINESS

00:19:20.192 --> 00:19:21.293
OWNERS -- I KNOW WHO.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.428
IT'S RIVER GOING THROUGH -- OUR

00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:25.330
TAXES AND TALKING TO THE WORKING

00:19:25.397 --> 00:19:26.732
WITH ACCOUNTANTS SO FORTH.

00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:29.167
SO -- AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER

00:19:29.234 --> 00:19:30.702
I JUST WANT TO ASK -- AND WE

00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:32.738
OFTEN TAUGHT IN ANYWAYS -- WHO

00:19:32.804 --> 00:19:34.306
WOULD BE ACCURATE TO SAY THAT TO

00:19:34.373 --> 00:19:36.942
MANY OF THE PROVISIONS HERE

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:38.911
WOULD ACTUALLY SIMPLIFY -- OUR

00:19:38.977 --> 00:19:41.046
TAXES -- THAT WOULD REDUCE

00:19:41.113 --> 00:19:42.948
POTENTIALLY EVEN SOME PERHAPS I

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:45.951
WANT MY ACCOUNT MAY NOT BE HAPPY-TO HEAR THIS BUT ACTUALLY REDUCE

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:47.553
SO MY COUNTY COSTS WHEN I DO MY

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:48.053
TAXES.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.555
WOULD THAT BE AN ACCURATE

00:19:49.621 --> 00:19:51.189
REFLECTION OF SOME OF THESE

00:19:51.256 --> 00:19:53.325
PROPOSALS -- AS A SMALL BUSINESS

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:54.493
OWNER.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.194
YES I WOULD SAY IT REDUCES BOTH

00:19:56.261 --> 00:19:57.863
YOUR ACCOUNTING COSTS AND YOUR

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.065
ACTUAL TAX LIABILITY IN MANY

00:20:00.132 --> 00:20:01.700
CASES AND SO BASICALLY THE

00:20:01.767 --> 00:20:03.001
PROVISIONS THAT MY COLLEAGUE WAS

00:20:03.068 --> 00:20:03.902
DISCUSSING.

00:20:03.969 --> 00:20:05.470
RIGHT NOW ARE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:07.239
SMALL BUSINESS IF YOU HAVE UP TO

00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:08.707
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE

00:20:08.774 --> 00:20:10.008
AND THIS WOULD BASICALLY TAKE

00:20:10.075 --> 00:20:11.176
THAT TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION OF

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:12.544
COURSE FIVE MILLION SOUNDS LIKE

00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:13.545
A LOT BUT YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE

00:20:13.612 --> 00:20:15.247
RUNNING WHATEVER SMALL BUT YOU

00:20:15.314 --> 00:20:15.681
COULD HAVE A NUMBER.

00:20:15.747 --> 00:20:16.748
OF EMPLOYEES YOU'RE STILL NOT A

00:20:16.815 --> 00:20:17.950
BIG CORPORATION YOU STILL DON'T

00:20:18.016 --> 00:20:18.984
HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:21.186
BOOKKEEPING AND INTERNAL ONE

00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:22.688
AUDITING RESOURCES THAT THEY HAD.

00:20:22.754 --> 00:20:24.489
SO THIS WOULD REDUCE THAT BURDEN

00:20:24.556 --> 00:20:25.857
IN THE COST OF GOING THROUGH ALL

00:20:25.924 --> 00:20:27.092
OF IT AND THEY WOULD LIKELY PAY

00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:28.660
LESS IN TAXES AS WELL AS A

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:30.662
RESULT OF MOVING FROM A CRUEL TO

00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:32.030
A CASH ACCOUNTING METHOD.

00:20:32.097 --> 00:20:32.664
OKAY SO I THINK THAT'S A VERY

00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:34.466
IMPORTANT POINT THE OTHER THING

00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:35.367
IS I WOULD WELL CERTAINLY THAT

00:20:35.434 --> 00:20:37.803
PARTICULAR PROVISION FOR SMALL

00:20:37.869 --> 00:20:39.137
BUSINESSES WELL -- SAY SMALL

00:20:39.204 --> 00:20:41.340
BUSINESS MONEY AND ACTUALLY AND

00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:42.741
AND AND AND DOES DECREASE AS YOU

00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:43.675
MENTIONED SOME OF THE REVENUE

00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:44.509
COMES THE STATE EVEN THE

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:45.877
PROVISIONS THAT INCREASED

00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:49.014
REVENUE TO THE STATE -- THE FACT

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:54.386
THAT WE NOW ARE -- I GUESS IN

00:20:54.453 --> 00:20:55.921
LINE WITH SOME OF THE CHANGES

00:20:55.988 --> 00:20:58.357
AGAINST VERY SELECTIVELY IN LINE

00:20:58.423 --> 00:20:59.157
WITH FELT THAT WITH WOULDN'T

00:20:59.224 --> 00:21:01.526
THAT ALSO REDUCE SOME OF THE

00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:02.961
BURDENS ON BUSINESSES.

00:21:03.028 --> 00:21:05.831
AND REGARDS -- TO BOTH

00:21:05.897 --> 00:21:07.633
ACCOUNTING BOOKKEEPING AND AS

00:21:07.699 --> 00:21:11.470
WELL AS TO TAX FILINGS WOULD YOU

00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:12.738
WOULD YOU WOULD THAT BE AN ACTOR

00:21:12.804 --> 00:21:12.971
TO ASK.

00:21:13.038 --> 00:21:14.139
YES THAT'S CORRECT OKAY SO IT SO

00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:15.207
I THINK AGAIN SOMETHING TO KEEP

00:21:15.273 --> 00:21:16.842
IN MIND THAT YOU KNOW EVEN AS WE

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:18.510
LOOK AT SOME OF THESE PROVISIONS

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:20.045
WHICH ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN DECIDED

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:22.914
BY OUR FEDERAL -- PARTNERS SOME

00:21:22.981 --> 00:21:24.216
OF WHICH WE MAY AGREE OR NOT HE

00:21:24.282 --> 00:21:25.150
BY MEANS THE PARTICULAR

00:21:25.217 --> 00:21:27.619
PROVISIONS WE'VE SELECTED -- ARE

00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:30.022
WOULD EACH OF THEM -- ACTUALLY

00:21:30.088 --> 00:21:32.024
HELP -- ACTUALLY DECREASE SOME

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.126
OF THE BURDEN ON BUSINESSES WHO

00:21:34.192 --> 00:21:41.099
HAVE WHO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS

00:21:41.166 --> 00:21:41.767
PARTICULAR ISSUES IS THAT

CORRECT YES THAT'S CORRECT ALL

00:21:44.202 --> 00:21:45.537
RIGHT WELL I THINK THAT'S A VERY

00:21:45.604 --> 00:21:46.138
POSITIVE THING HERE I KNOW.

00:21:46.204 --> 00:21:47.172
SOME PEOPLE ARE CHALLENGE WITH

00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:47.939
THE WORD CONFORMITY -- ANYTHING

00:21:48.006 --> 00:21:50.208
MORE ACTUALLY THIS IS -- PERHAPS --

BOTH TAX SIMPLIFICATION AS WELL

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.912
AS SELECTIVE ALIGNMENT -- THAT --

00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:57.783
MEETS OUR POLICY GOALS -- AND IS

00:21:57.849 --> 00:21:58.550
CERTAINLY YOU -- WITH HER

00:21:58.617 --> 00:22:01.887
SUPPORT FOR THIS PROVISION ALONG

00:22:01.953 --> 00:22:03.255
THOSE LINES THANK YOU.

00:22:03.321 --> 00:22:04.389
THANK YOU AND SENATOR PAN THAT'S

00:22:04.456 --> 00:22:05.123
WHY OUR AGENDA REFLECTS ITS

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.625
CURRENT NAME WHICH IS THE

00:22:06.692 --> 00:22:07.893
LOOPHOLE CLOSURE AND SMALL

00:22:07.959 --> 00:22:09.327
BUSINESS AND WORKING FAMILIES

00:22:09.394 --> 00:22:12.497
TAX RELIEF ACT OF TWENTY

00:22:12.564 --> 00:22:13.198
NINETEEN CONFORM HE'S NOT

00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:14.533
REFERENCE IN THERE AT ALL I

00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:16.568
THINK FOR JUST THOSE REASONS.

00:22:16.635 --> 00:22:18.670
SENATOR NIELSEN.

00:22:18.737 --> 00:22:20.172
INDEED I CAN CONCUR WITH YOUR

00:22:20.238 --> 00:22:21.740
ASSESSMENT.

00:22:21.807 --> 00:22:22.941
SURE OF THE TITLE.

00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:27.079
BUT AS TO THE OVERALL DEAL.

00:22:27.145 --> 00:22:30.315
THIS ISN'T THROUGH EXPLICIT.

00:22:30.382 --> 00:22:32.451
CONFORMITY AND SELECT OR

00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:33.752
TARGETED CONFORMITY IS IT NOT.

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:35.220
THAT'S CORRECT AND BASED ON THE

00:22:35.287 --> 00:22:37.022
RATIONALE IS THAT YOU'VE

00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:38.790
PRESENTED HERE [inaudible]

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:39.758
GOING [inaudible]

00:22:39.825 --> 00:22:41.827
FORWARD.

00:22:41.893 --> 00:22:43.595
IN THE SOME OF THIS MONEY WILL

00:22:43.662 --> 00:22:45.697
BE INTO THE GENERAL FUND WILL BE

00:22:45.764 --> 00:22:47.799
SPENT ON WHATEVER.

00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:50.268
IN THE GENERAL FUND.

00:22:50.335 --> 00:22:54.573
LONG TERM SAY. TO BUDGET CYCLES.

00:22:54.639 --> 00:22:56.541
WILL THIS HAVE A PLUS -- A

00:22:56.608 --> 00:22:58.577
NEGATIVE IMPACT [inaudible]

00:22:58.643 --> 00:23:03.615
ON ONGOING EXPENDITURES THE BASE.

00:23:03.682 --> 00:23:05.717
THE BASE THE CALIFORNIA BASED

00:23:05.784 --> 00:23:06.952
TAX.

00:23:07.018 --> 00:23:08.720
WE GO UP DO WE GO DOWN WE STAY

00:23:08.787 --> 00:23:10.288
NEUTRAL.

00:23:10.355 --> 00:23:11.957
SO OUR BEST ESTIMATE RIGHT NOW

00:23:12.023 --> 00:23:13.959
IS IT WILL HAVE A POSITIVE

00:23:14.025 --> 00:23:15.360
EFFECT OF A COUPLE HUNDRED

00:23:15.427 --> 00:23:16.661
MILLION DOLLARS BUT I SHOULD

00:23:16.728 --> 00:23:18.563
POINT OUT THAT THIS WOULD BE A

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.832
NEW PROGRAM SET UP PROGRAMS --

00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:21.666
SO WE'RE GOING TO BE WATCHING

00:23:21.733 --> 00:23:22.768
THE REVENUE ESTIMATES IF THIS

00:23:22.834 --> 00:23:24.736
PASSES VERY CLOSELY AND WE WILL

00:23:24.803 --> 00:23:25.804
UPDATE ACCORDINGLY [inaudible]

00:23:25.871 --> 00:23:29.040
THANK YOU [inaudible]

00:23:29.107 --> 00:23:33.445
BROUGH.

00:23:33.512 --> 00:23:36.414
HI MOM IN GOING THROUGH THIS.

00:23:36.481 --> 00:23:38.950
AND YOU GAVE HER THINK YOU DID.

00:23:39.017 --> 00:23:40.051
GIVE SOME AMOUNT I'D LIKE TO

00:23:40.118 --> 00:23:43.054
KNOW WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON

00:23:43.121 --> 00:23:45.557
REGULAR CALIFORNIANS OUT THERE

00:23:45.624 --> 00:23:48.794
LIKE -- AND THE MAYBE IT'S BY

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.929
VIRTUE OF HOW MANY.

00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:51.997
HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE

00:23:52.063 --> 00:23:54.065
IMPACTED OR HOW MANY BUSINESSES

00:23:54.132 --> 00:23:55.600
WOULD BE IMPACTED BUT?

00:23:55.667 --> 00:23:57.135
WHAT DO THESE BIG NUMBERS

00:23:57.202 --> 00:23:58.603
TRANSLATE INTO?

00:23:58.670 --> 00:23:59.871
AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF

00:23:59.938 --> 00:24:02.641
CALIFORNIANS THAT YOU COULD BEST.

00:24:02.707 --> 00:24:05.777
ESTIMATE WOULD BE IMPACTED I'M

00:24:05.844 --> 00:24:07.846
I'M NOT ASKING NEGATIVE OR

00:24:07.913 --> 00:24:09.881
POSITIVE BUT WOULD BE IMPACTED

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:12.551
BY IT SO IF YOU COULD GIVE SOME

00:24:12.617 --> 00:24:14.953
AMOUNT FOR THEM SO THAT --

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.722
EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WHAT'S

00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:19.224
THE APPROXIMATE NUMBER.

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:21.960
ALL AFFECTED BY EITC SO WE'RE

00:24:22.027 --> 00:24:23.428
EXPECTING IF THIS BILL WERE TO

00:24:23.495 --> 00:24:24.796
PASS THAT THE NUMBER OF

00:24:24.863 --> 00:24:26.498
HOUSEHOLDS RECEIVING THE EITC

00:24:26.565 --> 00:24:27.666
WOULD GO UP BY A MILLION SO

00:24:27.732 --> 00:24:29.367
CURRENTLY IT'S TWO MILLION AND

00:24:29.434 --> 00:24:30.168
WE'RE EXPECTING YOU WOULD GO TO

00:24:30.235 --> 00:24:30.769
THREE MILLION.

00:24:30.836 --> 00:24:33.138
SO FROM ONE TO THREE MILLION TWO

00:24:33.205 --> 00:24:34.573
MILLION TO THREE MILLION I'M

00:24:34.639 --> 00:24:36.007
SORRY TWO TO THREE MILLION.

00:24:36.074 --> 00:24:38.777
WOULD BE THE IMPACT -- AND SOME

00:24:38.844 --> 00:24:40.111
OF THE USER COULD BE REALLY

00:24:40.178 --> 00:24:42.681
<u>MALL NUMBERS BUT THE NEXT ONE</u>

00:24:42.747 --> 00:24:44.916
TO BE IN A BETTER LIFE

00:24:44.983 --> 00:24:46.117
EXPERIENCE ACCOUNTS.

00:24:46.184 --> 00:24:46.751
SO I BELIEVE THAT IS AROUND ONE

00:24:46.818 --> 00:24:48.486
MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL -- BUT
