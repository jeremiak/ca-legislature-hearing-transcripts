01:20:28.690 --> 01:20:30.825
INTO EFFECT. THAT SAME

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:32.727
CALIFORNIA AND WHEN THEY WENT TO

01:20:32.794 --> 01:20:34.329

PAY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS

FOR THAT SAME INSULIN. BECAUSE

THOSE REBATES. AND NOT EXAMPLE.

THE HEALTH PLAN WILL CONTINUE TO

PAY NOTHING BECAUSE THE PATIENT

01:20:45.941 --> 01:20:47.542
WAS IN THE DEDUCTIBLE PERIOD.

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:00.195
IN EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS AS

01:25:00.261 --> 01:25:01.663
THEY WERE DEVELOPING THIS

01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:02.864
PROPOSAL. BUT I REGRETTABLY WE

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.599
HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT-

01:25:04.666 --> 01:25:05.867
WE BELIEVE THAT THE COST TO

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:07.535
EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES AND

01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:08.770
INDIVIDUALS FAR OUTWEIGH THE

01:25:08.837 --> 01:25:11.673
BENEFITS OF THIS LEGISLATION.

01:25:11.739 --> 01:25:13.341
AND THIS IS MOREMOST CLEARLY

01:25:13.408 --> 01:25:15.944
DEMONSTRATED- BY THE CONCLUSIONS

01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:17.345
OF THE INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS BY

01:25:17.412 --> 01:25:18.746
THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS

01:25:18.813 --> 01:25:20.648
REVIEW PROGRAMMER CHIPPER. A

01:25:20.715 --> 01:25:22.016
CHIPPER CONCLUDED THAT THIS BILL

01:25:22.083 --> 01:25:24.118
WOULD INCREASE PREMIUMS IN THE

01:25:24.185 --> 01:25:24.652
FIRST YEAR BY TWO HUNDRED

01:25:24.719 --> 01:25:26.988
MILLION DOLLARS- IN THE EMPLOYER

01:25:27.055 --> 01:25:29.324
ANY DIFFICULT FOR EMPLOYERS AND

01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:29.791
INDIVIDUALS AT COVERED

01:25:29.858 --> 01:25:32.460
CALIFORNIA- SO THAT WOULD MAKE

01:25:32.527 --> 01:25:33.461
IT THE SECOND HIGHEST THE

01:25:33.528 --> 01:25:35.263
HIGHEST COSTA MANDATE BILL OF

01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:37.232
THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION. I'M

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:38.600
DISCUSSES ALMOST THREE TIMES A

01:25:38.666 --> 01:25:39.901
PURPORTED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR

01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:41.703
BENEFIT THAT WILL BE EXPERIENCED

01:25:41.769 --> 01:25:43.805
BY SOME CONSUMERS. I'M IN OTHER

01:25:43.872 --> 01:25:44.539
WORDS CONSUMERS WILL

01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:46.708
COLLECTIVELY PAY MORE SO THAT

01:25:46.774 --> 01:25:49.844
SOME MIGHT PAY LESS AND WE DON'T

01:25:49.911 --> 01:25:51.346
BELIEVE IT'S REALLY PENCILS OUT.

01:25:51.412 --> 01:25:52.347
A SIMILAR PROPOSAL WAS

01:25:52.413 --> 01:25:54.449
CONSIDERED- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

01:25:54.516 --> 01:25:56.584
FOR MEDICARE PART D. UNDER THE

01:25:56.651 --> 01:25:58.319
PRIOR FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION IN

01:25:58.386 --> 01:25:59.521
THE MEDICARE PROGRAM IN THE

01:25:59.587 --> 01:26:01.256
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE.

01:26:01.322 --> 01:26:02.490
ULTIMATELY CONCLUDED THAT THE

01:26:02.557 --> 01:26:03.725
PROPOSAL WOULD COST THE FEDERAL

01:26:03.791 --> 01:26:05.193
GOVERNMENT HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:07.061
OF DOLLARS OVER TEN YEARS. AND

01:26:07.128 --> 01:26:07.829
THAT THE MAJORITY OF

01:26:07.896 --> 01:26:09.197
BENEFICIARIES WOULD SEE AN

01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:10.598
INCREASE IN THEIR TOTAL OUT OF

01:26:10.665 --> 01:26:13.468
POCKET COSTS AND PREMIUMS. SO WE

01:26:13.535 --> 01:26:15.169
DON'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE

01:26:15.236 --> 01:26:15.904
TRYING TO SING CALIFORNIA. ON

01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:17.405
THE OTHER ISSUES WITH THIS BILL

01:26:17.472 --> 01:26:18.773
FROM POLICY PERSPECTIVE ARE. IT

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.542
LEADS TO A PRIORITIZATION OF

01:26:20.608 --> 01:26:22.477
EXPENSIVE BRAND NAME DRUGS- OVER

01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:23.411
LOW COST ALTERNATIVES LIKE

01:26:23.478 --> 01:26:25.580
GENERICS. IN THIS IS BECAUSE

01:26:25.647 --> 01:26:27.148
REBATES ARE REALLY FOUND. ON THE

01:26:27.215 --> 01:26:29.617
BRAND NAME DRUG SIDE- ALSO

01:26:29.684 --> 01:26:30.652
THERE'S NO EASY WAY TO IMPLEMENT

01:26:30.718 --> 01:26:33.221
THIS BILL- REBATES ARE NOT

01:26:33.288 --> 01:26:34.656
ALWAYS. REAL TIME FOR MANY OF

01:26:34.722 --> 01:26:36.057
THE HEALTH PLANS. A REBATE MAY

01:26:36.124 --> 01:26:37.792
NOT BE GRANTED ARE GRANTED IN

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:40.061
THE- ESTIMATE EXPECTED. IN THERE

01:26:40.128 --> 01:26:41.462
ARE A VARIETY OF REASONS FOR

01:26:41.529 --> 01:26:43.364
THIS IT WOULD TAKE LONGER THAN I

01:26:43.431 --> 01:26:44.866
HAVE. BUT IN MANY CASES IF THERE

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:46.834
IS A REBATE IT ISN'T ACTUALLY

01:26:46.901 --> 01:26:47.602
SECURED UNTIL THREE TO SIX

01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:49.404
MONTHS LATER IF NOT LONGER. SO

01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:51.139
THIS BILL DOES NOT ADEQUATELY

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:27.455
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS WE'VE

01:35:27.521 --> 01:35:28.589
HEARD THAT SOMETIMES ARE REBATES

01:35:28.656 --> 01:35:30.591
NOW TAKE. MY TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS

01:35:30.658 --> 01:35:32.426
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW WE DO THAT

01:35:32.493 --> 01:35:34.862
AT A POINT OF SALE. YOU'VE BEEN

01:35:34.929 --> 01:35:35.729
TO A PHARMACY LATELY REALIZE

01:35:35.796 --> 01:35:38.566
THAT- IT SOMETIMES TAKES TEN

01:35:38.632 --> 01:35:40.334
YEAR TEN TIMES LONGER JUST TO

01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:42.803
PICK UP A PRESCRIPTION THAT THAT

01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:43.804
YOU'VE BEEN THAT THAT WAS CALLED

01:35:43.871 --> 01:35:47.374
IN EVEN DAYS BEFORE SO WE'RE

01:35:47.441 --> 01:35:48.809
TASKING. BUT OVER WORK SYSTEM

01:35:48.876 --> 01:35:50.945
WITH SOMETHING NEW THAT. IS

01:35:51.011 --> 01:35:52.213
GOING TO BE REALLY DIFFICULT TO

01:35:52.279 --> 01:35:53.647
IMPLEMENT AND SO THAT'S WHY I'VE

01:35:53.714 --> 01:35:54.882
SAID MY IMPLEMENTATION CONCERNS

01:35:54.949 --> 01:35:56.450
OF HAVE BEEN THERE FOR THE YES

01:35:56.517 --> 01:35:58.219
AND I RESPECT THOSE MISTER

01:35:58.285 --> 01:35:59.520
CHAIR- BUT I GUESS MY QUESTION

01:35:59.587 --> 01:36:00.588
FOR THE PROPONENTS IS. WHAT

01:36:00.654 --> 01:36:01.722
KEEPS THE DRUG COMPANIES FROM

01:36:01.789 --> 01:36:04.692
JUST. RAISING PRICES EVEN HIGHER

01:36:04.758 --> 01:36:06.861
. I MEAN I DON'T SEE ANY I SEE I

01:36:06.927 --> 01:36:09.330
SEE POTENTIAL. CONSUMER BENEFIT.

01:36:09.396 --> 01:36:11.532
ON THE REBATE. BUT I DON'T SEE A

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:13.701
BENEFIT. ANYTHING THAT HELPS TO

01:36:13.767 --> 01:36:16.403
KEEP THE PRICES LOWER. OR FROM

01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:19.807
GOING HIGHER NEEDLESSLY. HI

01:36:19.874 --> 01:36:21.809
CHAIRMAN LLOYD THANK YOU FOR THE

01:36:21.876 --> 01:36:23.477
QUESTION I THINK WHAT WE HAVE

01:36:23.544 --> 01:36:25.579
SEEN IN IN THE MARKET OVER THE

01:36:25.646 --> 01:36:27.548
LAST SEVERAL YEARS IS THAT

01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:29.984
COMPETITION TO MAKE PRICES MORE

01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:31.552
AFFORDABLE FOR HEALTH PLANS AND

01:36:31.619 --> 01:36:34.455
PBMS IS REALLY ON THE REBATED

01:36:34.522 --> 01:36:36.991
PRICE AND SO THEY ARE LOOKING TO

01:36:37.057 --> 01:36:38.559
GET A BETTER PRICE ON THEIR

01:36:38.626 --> 01:36:40.861
DRUGS THROUGH NEGOTIATING A

01:36:40.928 --> 01:36:42.396
HIGHER REBATE SO OVER TIME WE

01:36:42.463 --> 01:36:44.832
HAVE SEEN. GROWTH IN REBATES IF

01:36:44.899 --> 01:36:47.134
YOU LOOK JUST IN THE STATE OF

01:36:47.201 --> 01:36:48.769
CALIFORNIA WE'VE GONE FROM A

01:36:48.836 --> 01:36:49.770
NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR

01:36:49.837 --> 01:36:50.938
MILLION DOLLARS IN REBATES BEING

01:36:51.005 --> 01:36:53.073
PAID TO ONE FOUR POINT FOUR

01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:55.142
BILLION DOLLARS IN REBATES AND

01:36:55.209 --> 01:36:56.544
UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S CREATED A

01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:58.245
PERVERSE INCENTIVE WHERE A

01:36:58.312 --> 01:36:59.780
HIGHER REBATE IS ACTUALLY

01:36:59.847 --> 01:37:02.249
PREFERRED OVER A LOWER LIST

01:37:02.316 --> 01:37:05.252
PRICE DRUG AND SO YOU KNOW WHILE

01:37:05.319 --> 01:37:07.021
THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT

01:37:07.087 --> 01:37:09.356
SYSTEM THAT I THINK IS IN NEED

01:37:09.423 --> 01:37:11.425
OF FIXING IT DOES MAKE SURE THAT

01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:12.760
THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER IS

01:37:12.826 --> 01:37:15.896
BENEFITING- FROM THOSE REBATE AS

01:37:15.963 --> 01:37:18.465
AS THEY GO UP HERE IN THE STATE

01:37:18.532 --> 01:37:20.334
OF CALIFORNIA. I GUESS IF THE

01:37:20.401 --> 01:37:21.802
REBATES IF THIS SYSTEM IS A

01:37:21.869 --> 01:37:22.903
PROBLEM WHY WHY WOULDN'T YOU BE

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:25.906
LOOKING AT A WAY TO CHANGE THE

01:37:25.973 --> 01:37:26.974
REBATE SYSTEM WHERE THE PROBLEM

01:37:27.041 --> 01:37:29.944
IS RATHER THAN TRYING THIS ANGLE

01:37:30.010 --> 01:37:31.946
OF IT BECAUSE CLEARLY I KNOW

01:37:32.012 --> 01:37:33.547
WHERE THE PROBLEM IS YOU KNOW

01:37:33.614 --> 01:37:36.383
WHERE THE PROBLEM IS YOU YOU

01:37:36.450 --> 01:37:37.117
ILLUSTRATED VERY GOOD POINT. M.

01:37:37.184 --> 01:37:38.986
OFTEN AS PART OF THE FORMULARY

01:37:39.053 --> 01:37:40.788
WANT THAT BIGGER REBATES SO A

01:37:40.854 --> 01:37:42.323
LESS EXPENSIVE DRUG DOESN'T GET

01:37:42.389 --> 01:37:43.357
CONSIDERED BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

01:37:43.424 --> 01:37:44.858
GOING TO GET AS MUCH OF A

01:37:44.925 --> 01:37:47.328
REPAIR. SO WHY NOT GO AFTER THAT

01:37:47.394 --> 01:37:48.562
AS A WAY TO HELP PROTECT THE

01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:49.530
CONSUMER BECAUSE THAT COULD

01:37:49.597 --> 01:37:50.397
POTENTIALLY LOWER PREMIUMS

01:37:50.464 --> 01:37:52.032
BECAUSE THE YOUR BILL. ACTUALLY

01:37:52.099 --> 01:37:54.368
WILL LEAD TO INCREASE PREMIUMS

01:37:54.435 --> 01:37:56.170
AS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE

01:37:56.237 --> 01:37:57.671
OPPOSITION SO. HELP ME

01:37:57.738 --> 01:37:58.806
UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULDN'T GO

01:37:58.872 --> 01:38:00.908
IN THAT DIRECTION. I THINK YOU

01:38:00.975 --> 01:38:02.509
KNOW PHARMA DOES SUPPORT RIGHT-

01:38:02.576 --> 01:38:03.777
TRANSFORMING THE REBATE SYSTEM

01:38:03.844 --> 01:38:05.879
AT A FEDERAL LEVEL- I THINK

01:38:05.946 --> 01:38:07.715
DOING THAT AT A STATE BY STATE

01:38:07.781 --> 01:38:09.483
BASIS COULD. COULD HAVE THE

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:10.784
PERVERSE INCENTIVES IN A

01:38:10.851 --> 01:38:12.853
CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC MARKET PLACE

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:14.755
SO REALLY WE NEED TO SEE IT

01:38:14.822 --> 01:38:17.458
CHANGED AT A NATIONAL LEVEL- AS

01:38:17.524 --> 01:38:19.660
FAR AS THE POINT ON PREMIUMS

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:21.695
HEARING CALIFORNIA I DO WANT TO

01:38:21.762 --> 01:38:23.497
NOTE AS PART OF THAT TRIP BURKE

01:38:23.564 --> 01:38:25.232
REPORTS THAT WHILE. EXPENDITURES

01:38:25.299 --> 01:38:27.501
ARE EXPECTED TO GROW TWO HUNDRED

01:38:27.568 --> 01:38:29.670
MILLION DOLLARS. A MAJORITY OF

01:38:29.737 --> 01:38:32.773
THAT IS DUE TO- X. THE

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:34.441
EXPECTATION THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE

01:38:34.508 --> 01:38:36.277
ADHERENT TO THEIR MEDICINE AND

01:38:36.343 --> 01:38:36.777
THAT THERE IS INCREASED

01:38:36.844 --> 01:38:38.479
UTILIZATION AND THEN ALSO

01:38:38.545 --> 01:38:41.348
INCREASED COST TO THE PLAN FOR

01:38:41.415 --> 01:38:43.350
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. OKAY I

01:38:43.417 --> 01:38:45.019
STILL I STILL DON'T SEE WHERE

01:38:45.085 --> 01:38:47.421
THERE'S ANY INCENTIVE OR OR ANY

01:38:47.488 --> 01:38:49.923
ANY WAY TO KEEP. THE COST AND

01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:52.526
THE PRICE THE PRICES FROM GOING

01:38:52.593 --> 01:38:53.994
UP. SO WHAT ABOUT SOMEONE WHO

01:38:54.061 --> 01:38:55.129
DOESN'T HAVE INSURANCE COME

01:38:55.195 --> 01:38:56.697
COVERAGE OR HAS A REALLY HIGH

01:38:56.764 --> 01:38:59.099
DEDUCTIBLE AND HAS TO PAY THAT

01:38:59.166 --> 01:39:01.135
DEDUCTIBLE. THERE'S NOT GOING TO

01:39:01.201 --> 01:39:04.104
BE A READ THAT THERE MAY NOT BE

01:39:04.171 --> 01:39:04.805
A REBATE ABOUT AVAILABLE TO THEM

01:39:04.872 --> 01:39:06.407
SO HOW DOES THAT HELP THAT

01:39:06.473 --> 01:39:07.508
CONSUMER BECAUSE THERE'S A WHOLE

01:39:07.574 --> 01:39:09.476
LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE. WHO

01:39:09.543 --> 01:39:10.411
DON'T HAVE. THE YOU KNOW HE MAY

01:39:10.477 --> 01:39:12.313
NOT HAVE A PLAN THAT ALLOWS THEM

01:39:12.379 --> 01:39:14.081
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A REBATE SO

01:39:14.148 --> 01:39:16.250
HOW DOES THAT HELP THAT CONSUMER

01:39:16.317 --> 01:39:18.786
. I THINK. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:39:18.852 --> 01:39:19.720
PEOPLE HAVE INSURANCE HEALTH

01:39:19.787 --> 01:39:21.755
CARE IS NOT BUT THAT WASN'T MY

01:39:21.822 --> 01:39:22.923
QUESTION. IF THAT WAS MICHAEL IF

01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:24.725
I IF I DON'T HAVE INSURANCE. AND

01:39:24.792 --> 01:39:26.560
YOUR PRICE IS REALLY HIGH AND

01:39:26.627 --> 01:39:28.262
YOU KEEP RAISING PRICES. BECAUSE

01:39:28.329 --> 01:39:28.829
YOU'RE GONNA GET REBATES TO

01:39:28.896 --> 01:39:31.632
SOMEBODY. HOW DOES THAT HELP THE

01:39:31.699 --> 01:39:32.933
POOR PERSON WHO DOESN'T HAVE

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.835
MEDICATION INSURANCE. AND THEN

01:39:34.902 --> 01:39:36.804
THE POINT IS THAT WE'RE FOCUSING

01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:38.405
ON A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO

01:39:38.472 --> 01:39:40.240
HAVE INURANCE. AND WE'RE

01:39:40.307 --> 01:39:40.941
FOCUSING ON THOSE HIGH PRICE

01:39:41.008 --> 01:39:43.844
DRUGS- THAT THAT THAT ARE OUT

01:39:43.911 --> 01:39:45.412
THERE SO HOW DOES IT HELP THAT

01:39:45.479 --> 01:39:47.214
POOR PERSON WHO DOESN'T HAVE

01:39:47.281 --> 01:39:48.615
INSURANCE. GOING TO THE COUNTER

01:39:48.682 --> 01:39:50.317
AND GET STUCK WITH THAT BIG BILL

01:39:50.384 --> 01:39:51.919
HELP ME HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:39:51.985 --> 01:39:54.288
I THINK QUITE FRANKLY SPELL IT

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:56.056
DOESN'T ADDRESS PEOPLE THAT

01:39:56.123 --> 01:39:57.257
DON'T HAVE INSURANCE SO YOU

01:39:57.324 --> 01:39:58.692
DON'T HAVE INSURANCE AND YOU

01:39:58.759 --> 01:40:00.728
DON'T GET A REBATE. YOU JUST PAY

01:40:00.794 --> 01:40:04.498
THE HIGH PRICE. CORRECT THAT

01:40:04.565 --> 01:40:06.533
DOESN'T FEEL VERY FAIR TO ME.

01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:07.901
ALL THE AND I WILL SAY FOR

01:40:07.968 --> 01:40:09.236
PATIENTS THAT DON'T HAVE

01:40:09.303 --> 01:40:10.704
INSURANCE WE DO HAVE

01:40:10.771 --> 01:40:11.905
MANUFACTURERS ASSISTANCE

01:40:11.972 --> 01:40:13.674
PROGRAMS TO HELP MAKE THEIR

01:40:13.741 --> 01:40:16.510
MEDICATIONS MORE AFFORDABLE- AS

01:40:16.577 --> 01:40:18.579
FOR THE PATIENT WHO IS AT A HIGH

01:40:18.645 --> 01:40:19.780
DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLAN THIS IS

01:40:19.847 --> 01:40:20.981
THE BILL THAT'S GOING TO HELP

01:40:21.048 --> 01:40:22.816
THEM THE MOST BECAUSE WHEN

01:40:22.883 --> 01:40:23.450
THEY'RE EXPOSED TO THE LOWEST

01:40:23.517 --> 01:40:24.818
PRICE IT'S WHEN THEY'RE IN THEIR

01:40:24.885 --> 01:40:27.321
DEDUCTIBLE PERIOD- SO THIS BILL

01:40:27.388 --> 01:40:29.156
WILL ENSURE ANYTIME THAT THEY'RE

01:40:29.223 --> 01:40:30.357
IN THE DEDUCTIBLE THAT THEY

01:40:30.424 --> 01:40:31.725
ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM THAT NOT

01:40:31.792 --> 01:40:33.193
PRICE OF THE MEDICINE THE

01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:34.294
REBATED PRICE OF THE MEDICINE

01:40:34.361 --> 01:40:37.131
NOT THE HIGHER LIST PRICES AND I

01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:38.732
JUST I. SO WHEN I JUST LOWER THE

01:40:38.799 --> 01:40:40.367
PRICES YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU'RE

01:40:40.434 --> 01:40:41.735
GONNA GET THE ROUTE YOU KNOW YOU

01:40:41.802 --> 01:40:43.437
KNOW WHERE THE- YOU KNOW WHAT

01:40:43.504 --> 01:40:44.605
THE- THE WHOLESALE ACQUISITION

01:40:44.671 --> 01:40:46.507
COSTS ARE YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS.

01:40:46.573 --> 01:40:48.075
WHEN I JUST LOWER THE PRICES AND

01:40:48.142 --> 01:40:49.443
MAKE IT AFFORDABLE FOR. PEOPLE

01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:50.477
WITHOUT REPAYING. YEAH I THINK.

01:40:50.544 --> 01:40:51.879
THIS IS DEFINITELY A COMPLEX

01:40:51.945 --> 01:40:54.581
SYSTEM- AND OUR PRICES ARE NOT

01:40:54.648 --> 01:40:56.717
SET IN A VACUUM AND THAT SAME.

01:40:56.784 --> 01:40:58.652
U. S. SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE

01:40:58.719 --> 01:41:00.988
REPORT. THEY LOOKED AT GENERIC

01:41:01.054 --> 01:41:02.556
INSULIN THAT IS NOW COME TO

01:41:02.623 --> 01:41:04.191
MARKET THERE'S A- BIOSIMILAR

01:41:04.258 --> 01:41:06.226
INSULIN THAT COST. LESS THAN

01:41:06.293 --> 01:41:08.429
HALF OF ANY BRAND NAME INSULIN

01:41:08.495 --> 01:41:10.631
THAT'S ON THE MARKET TODAY. AND

01:41:10.697 --> 01:41:12.566
LARGE FORMULA ARIES LIKE EXPRESS

01:41:12.633 --> 01:41:14.601
SCRIPTS WHO HAS. A LARGER

01:41:14.668 --> 01:41:16.503
POPULATION IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY

01:41:16.570 --> 01:41:18.539
OF FRANCE. DOESN'T COVER THAT

01:41:18.605 --> 01:41:20.407
INSULIN ON THEIR PREFERRED

01:41:20.474 --> 01:41:23.811
FORMULARY. SO LET ME LET ME POSE

01:41:23.877 --> 01:41:25.045
YOUR QUESTION THAT I'VE MY

01:41:25.112 --> 01:41:26.313
PRODUCT ACTUALLY WE TALKED

01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:28.148
YESTERDAY. THERE'S A THERE'S A

01:41:28.215 --> 01:41:29.349
MEDICATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF

01:41:29.416 --> 01:41:31.819
KOVAN- THERE'S A COUPLE OF THEM

01:41:31.885 --> 01:41:34.021
BUT I'LL JUST TAKE TAKE ONE NOT

01:41:34.087 --> 01:41:35.856
GONNA NAME THE COMPANY. THE COST

01:41:35.923 --> 01:41:38.425
FOR THAT TEN DAY COURSE OF

01:41:38.492 --> 01:41:39.426
TREATMENT IS SEVEN HUNDRED

01:41:39.493 --> 01:41:42.162
DOLLARS. NOW INDIA HAS CREATED A

01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:45.732
GENERIC DRUG. THAT COSTA TEAM IS

01:41:45.799 --> 01:41:50.304
EIGHTEEN DOLLARS. SO AND THAT

01:41:50.370 --> 01:41:51.939
SAME COMPANIES CAN INVEST IN

01:41:52.005 --> 01:41:54.141
OTHER COMPANIES IN INDIA. HOW

01:41:54.208 --> 01:41:55.409
DID THAT COMPANY IN INDIA TO

01:41:55.476 --> 01:41:57.344
PROVIDE THIS **** THIS DRUG TO

01:41:57.411 --> 01:41:58.779
OTHER LOWER LOWER LOWER INCOME

TO REBATES AT THE POINT OF SALE

01:43:12.753 --> 01:43:13.554

01:43:34.875 --> 01:43:36.577
NOTHING TO PREVENT THE COMPANY'S

01:43:36.643 --> 01:43:38.579
FROM ACTUALLY DOING THAT- AND

VANCOUVER AND ALBERTA GRADUALLY

03:01:37.753 --> 03:01:38.654
HAVE SHOWN A STRUGGLE WITH

03:01:38.721 --> 03:01:40.356
OVERDOSES THAT TAKE PLACE

03:01:40.422 --> 03:01:42.658

OF SUCH SITES. DO NOT OUTLINES

03:01:53.869 --> 03:01:55.037
OVERDOSES BECAUSE THEY ARE

03:01:55.104 --> 03:01:57.273
TOTALLY FOCUSED ON OUTCOMES ONLY

03:01:57.339 --> 03:01:58.607
WITHIN THE WALLS OF THOSE

03:01:58.674 --> 03:02:00.609

THE FINISHED TESTIFYING RIGHT

03:02:02.044 --> 03:02:04.079

03:02:04.146 --> 03:02:06.248
STUDIES IN SUPPORT ONLY SUGGEST

03:02:06.315 --> 03:02:07.516
THIS COULD TAKE STRESS OFF OF

RESPONDENTS. NOT CONFIDENTLY.

03:02:10.019 --> 03:02:10.853
ADDITION OF THE BATTLE WITH

THE REALM OF METRICS TAKEN

03:02:17.926 --> 03:02:19.461
WITHIN THE CENTERS. ONCE THEY

03:02:19.528 --> 03:02:21.930
HAVE DONE SO. WE CANNOT IGNORE

03:02:21.997 --> 03:02:23.899
THE FACT DRAW MORE USERS WHO DO

03:02:37.346 --> 03:02:39.315

TO ARREST ANYONE OR PUT THEM IN

03:04:30.726 --> 03:04:33.028
JAIL THAT'S A FALSE DICHOTOMY WE

03:04:33.095 --> 03:04:36.031
OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE THE

03:04:36.098 --> 03:04:37.800
PREMISE OF THIS BILL IS

03:04:37.866 --> 03:04:42.070
FACTUALLY INACCURATE. OF THE

03:04:42.137 --> 03:04:46.108
HOUSE- FOR EXAMPLE. IN VANCOUVER

03:04:46.175 --> 03:04:48.577
OF THE IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN

03:04:48.644 --> 03:04:51.647
YEARS. THE INCREASE INCREASE NOT

03:04:51.713 --> 03:04:55.918
DECREASE INCREASE IN- OVERDOSE

03:04:55.984 --> 03:05:00.022
DEATHS 1000% IN ALBERTA PROVINCE

03:05:00.088 --> 03:05:04.393
INCREASE IN OVERDOSE DEATHS 65%

03:05:04.460 --> 03:05:10.365
IN- OF THE NETHERLANDS INCREASE

03:05:10.432 --> 03:05:14.837
IN TWO SEPARATE- LUMPS THE FIRST

03:05:14.903 --> 03:05:16.839
IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OR SO

03:05:16.905 --> 03:05:20.175
DOUBLE OVERDOSE DEATHS IN IN THE

03:05:20.242 --> 03:05:24.513
SECOND TEN YEARS DOUBLED AGAIN-

03:05:24.580 --> 03:05:26.915
AND- NORWAY. THERE REALLY WASN'T

03:05:26.982 --> 03:05:29.718
MUCH OF A CHANGE IN OVERDOSE

03:05:29.785 --> 03:05:32.020
DEATHS BUT YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER

03:05:32.087 --> 03:05:35.924
THAT EVEN THAT IS BECAUSE NORWAY

03:05:35.991 --> 03:05:38.894
HAS THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF

03:05:38.961 --> 03:05:40.996
OVERDOSE DEATHS IN ALL OF-

03:05:41.063 --> 03:05:43.966

OVERDOSE DEATHS IT'S AND HERE'S

03:05:49.738 --> 03:05:52.741
WHY THE REASON IS THAT MOST

03:05:52.808 --> 03:05:58.347
PEOPLE DO NOT USE THE- MOST MOST

03:05:58.413 --> 03:06:00.549
PEOPLE DO NOT USE THE INJECTION

03:06:02.818 --> 03:06:04.553
NUMBER FOR EXAMPLE IN CANADA IS

03:06:04.620 --> 03:06:06.421
ONLY FIVE PERCENT. BUT YOU GET A

WHERE THE DEATHS GO P THERE IS

03:06:16.498 --> 03:06:18.033

03:40:29.616 --> 03:40:31.117
NILE CARE AND THIS CORPORATE

03:40:31.184 --> 03:40:32.852
BUREAUCRACY BUT IT'S AS CLEAR

03:40:32.919 --> 03:40:35.388
AS DAY WE'RE BEING FLEECED AND

03:40:35.455 --> 03:40:37.324
FAR TOO MANY UNDERSTANDABLY

03:40:37.390 --> 03:40:39.559
FEEL HELPLESS ABOUT WE KNOW

03:40:39.626 --> 03:40:41.428
CHARACTER WILL BE CONSIDERED

03:40:41.494 --> 03:40:42.729
OF IT WILL BE CONSIDERABLY

03:40:42.796 --> 03:40:44.097
LESS EXPENSIVE THAN OUR CURRENT

03:40:44.164 --> 03:40:47.100
SYSTEM WE CAN DRIVE DOWN COSTS

03:40:47.167 --> 03:40:49.035
FAR BELOW OUR CURRENT SYSTEM

03:40:49.102 --> 03:40:51.371
WHILE EXPANDING CARE SECOND

03:40:51.438 --> 03:40:52.572
YOU MAY HEAR THE GOVERNMENT

03:40:52.639 --> 03:40:53.773
IS BAD THEY CAN'T RUN OUR

03:40:53.840 --> 03:40:55.275
HEALTH CARE AS OFFICIALLY AS

03:40:55.342 --> 03:40:57.444
PRIVATE INDUSTRY ALL THIS IS

03:40:57.510 --> 03:40:58.511
ALSO WHERE WE NEED TO BE VERY

03:40:58.578 --> 03:41:00.213
CLEAR THIS IS NOT A GOVERNMENT

03:41:00.280 --> 03:41:01.982
TAKEOVER OF HEALTHCARE YOU

03:41:02.048 --> 03:41:03.149
STILL HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO

03:41:03.216 --> 03:41:04.584
THE SAME DOCTORS AND NURSES

03:41:04.651 --> 03:41:06.753
AND CLINICS YOU ACCESS TO NOW

03:41:06.820 --> 03:41:07.687
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE OF THE

03:41:07.754 --> 03:41:08.955
TAB WILL BE PICKED UP BY THE

03:41:09.022 --> 03:41:11.124
STATE HEALTHCARE MY FATHER

03:41:11.191 --> 03:41:12.225
HAS GONE TO THE SAME DOCTOR

03:41:12.292 --> 03:41:13.827
AND UNFORTUNATELY ON OCCASION

03:41:13.893 --> 03:41:16.129
HOSPITAL FOR DECADES HE'S

03:41:16.196 --> 03:41:17.530
ON MEDICARE FOR OVER A DOZEN

03:41:17.597 --> 03:41:19.299
YEARS HE HASN'T CHANGED WHERE

03:41:19.366 --> 03:41:21.334
HE GOES FOR CARE ONE BIT THE

03:41:21.401 --> 03:41:22.902
ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT IS

03:41:22.969 --> 03:41:24.304
LESS BUREAUCRATIC NOW THAT

03:41:24.371 --> 03:41:25.839
HE SIMPLY SHOWS HIS MEDICARE

03:41:25.905 --> 03:41:28.308
CARD FOR CARE AND LET'S NOT

03:41:28.375 --> 03:41:30.110
BE UNDER THE ILLUSION THAT

03:41:30.176 --> 03:41:31.478
DEALING WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE

03:41:31.544 --> 03:41:33.146
COMPANIES AS A JOY IT IS

03:41:33.213 --> 03:41:35.148
PAINFUL ESPECIALLY WHEN SOME

03:41:35.215 --> 03:41:36.783
UNKNOWN CORPORATE BUREAUCRAT

03:41:36.850 --> 03:41:39.452
IGNORES THE SCIENTIFIC EDUCATED

03:41:39.519 --> 03:41:41.521
DIAGNOSIS OF A NURSE OR DOCTOR

03:41:41.588 --> 03:41:43.223
AND OVERRULES THE TREATMENT

03:41:43.289 --> 03:41:45.291
PRESCRIBED AND THEN THE DOCTOR

03:41:45.358 --> 03:41:46.693
OR INSURANCE COMPANY TELLS YOU

03:41:46.760 --> 03:41:48.395
TO START A GO FUND ME ACCOUNT

03:41:48.461 --> 03:41:49.496
IN THE WEALTHIEST STATE IN THE

03:41:49.562 --> 03:41:51.364
WEALTHIEST NATION ON EARTH THIS

03:41:51.431 --> 03:41:54.134
SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING YOU MAY

03:41:54.200 --> 03:41:56.536

YOUR DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS --

03:42:00.340 --> 03:42:01.841
ARE YOU NEARLY LIMITED BASED

03:42:01.908 --> 03:42:03.043
UPON THE PLAN OR GROUP YOU'RE

03:42:03.109 --> 03:42:05.011
PART OF WE WANT TO GET RID

03:42:05.078 --> 03:42:06.980
OF THE OUT OF NETWORK MADNESS

03:42:07.047 --> 03:42:08.281
GO TO THE DOCTOR HOSPITAL

03:42:08.348 --> 03:42:09.916
CLINIC MOST CONVENIENT TO

03:42:09.983 --> 03:42:11.384
YOU THAT WE WANT TO INCREASE

03:42:11.451 --> 03:42:12.652
CHOICE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS IS

03:42:12.719 --> 03:42:14.154
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO RURAL

03:42:14.220 --> 03:42:15.655
COMMUNITIES AND UNDERSERVED

03:42:15.722 --> 03:42:17.390
COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE ARE

03:42:17.457 --> 03:42:20.960
LIMITED OPTIONS YOU'LL HEAR

03:42:21.761 --> 03:42:22.929
BUT NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF CODE

03:42:22.996 --> 03:42:24.998
IS NOT THE TIME ACCORDING TO

03:42:25.065 --> 03:42:27.167
OPPOSITION IS NEVER THE TIME

03:42:27.233 --> 03:42:28.601
HOWEVER I WOULD SUGGEST THAT

03:42:28.668 --> 03:42:29.903
THE COVER CRISIS IS PERFECTLY

03:42:29.969 --> 03:42:32.205
EXEMPLIFIED WHY OUR EMPLOYER

03:42:32.272 --> 03:42:35.175
BASED MULTI PAYER USUALLY

03:42:35.241 --> 03:42:37.243
PROFITABLE FOR THE VERY FEW

03:42:37.310 --> 03:42:39.446
SYSTEM IS AN OUT LIAR IN THE

03:42:39.512 --> 03:42:41.748
WORLD A QUARTER OF CALIFORNIA

03:42:41.815 --> 03:42:43.316
FAMILIES HAVE CUT BACK ON FOOD

CLOTHING OR IN COURT CREDIT

03:42:45.385 --> 03:42:46.686
CARD DEBT OR OTHER FINANCIAL

03:42:46.753 --> 03:42:48.021
HARDSHIPS BECAUSE THEY WERE

03:42:48.088 --> 03:42:50.523
UNABLE TO PAY MEDICAL BILLS OUR

03:42:50.590 --> 03:42:51.858
RESIDENTS ARE DELAYING MEDICAL

03:42:51.925 --> 03:42:53.293
TREATMENT CUTTING PILLS IN HALF

03:42:53.359 --> 03:42:54.527
TO MAKE THEIR MEDICATION LAST

03:42:54.594 --> 03:42:56.429
LONGER WE ALREADY HAVE HEALTH

03:42:56.496 --> 03:42:57.764
CARE RATIONING WITH THE STATUS

03:42:57.831 --> 03:42:59.632
QUO AND THAT'S WHY EIGHTY

03:42:59.699 --> 03:43:01.501
FOUR PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS

03:43:01.568 --> 03:43:02.836
RATE MAKING HEALTH CARE MORE

03:43:02.902 --> 03:43:04.637

THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

03:47:28.401 --> 03:47:30.303
ALLOWED FOR FUNDS A TO COPE

03:47:30.370 --> 03:47:32.171

ANNUALLY YEAR AFTER YEAR

04:11:42.720 --> 04:11:44.956
AFTER YEAR ON THE STRUGGLING

04:11:45.023 --> 04:11:46.224
CALIFORNIANS ATTEMPTING TO GET

04:11:46.291 --> 04:11:47.892
THROUGH PANDEMIC SO THE STATE

04:11:47.959 --> 04:11:49.027
CAN TAKE OVER ONE OF THE MOST

04:11:49.093 --> 04:11:51.062
COMPLEX SYSTEMS THAT EXISTS

04:11:51.129 --> 04:11:53.331
IN THE MIDST OF AN UNRELENTING

04:11:53.398 --> 04:11:55.700
COBA NINETEEN PANDEMIC ALSO

MANY THE ENORMOUS TAX INCREASES

04:12:11.816 --> 04:12:13.084
WOULD HAVE AN UNREMITTED PACE

04:12:13.151 --> 04:12:15.587
OF GROWTH NEXT WE OPPOSE AB

04:12:15.653 --> 04:12:16.554
FOURTEEN HUNDRED BECAUSE IT

04:12:16.621 --> 04:12:18.656

NOT NATIONALIZED HEALTHCARE

04:12:28.433 --> 04:12:29.868
EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES WOULD

04:12:29.934 --> 04:12:31.936
BE FREE TO LEAVE THE STATE AND

04:12:32.003 --> 04:12:32.904
THEY COULD LEAVE THE STATE SO

THAT THEY COULD USE THEIR OWN

IT OUT THERE IN A REASONABLE

05:16:18.426 --> 05:16:19.760
TIME LINE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY

05:16:19.827 --> 05:16:21.529
BE A RELATIVELY QUICK TIMELINE

05:16:21.595 --> 05:16:23.297

05:16:23.364 --> 05:16:25.199
YEAR PLAN APPEARED THAT THE

YEAR DID I HEAR THAT CORRECTLY

05:16:44.752 --> 05:16:47.088
-- I HOPE IT DOES BUT AT THE

05:16:47.154 --> 05:16:48.189
END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW WE HAVE

DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS AND SO

05:17:06.507 --> 05:17:08.476
ULTIMATELY THE WAY THAT THIS

05:17:08.542 --> 05:17:10.544
HAS BEEN SET UP AS IN A MANNER

05:17:10.611 --> 05:17:12.680
THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT

05:17:12.747 --> 05:17:13.714
WE LEARNED FROM THE FEDERAL

05:17:13.781 --> 05:17:14.749
GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF THE

05:17:14.815 --> 05:17:15.883
TIMELINE OF WHAT NEEDS TO GO

FIRST WITHOUT A POLICY NOTHING

05:17:18.619 --> 05:17:20.921

ABOUT -- TALKED ABOUT THE --

05:17:54.155 --> 05:17:56.123
THE WAY THEY PROVIDE CARE OF

05:17:56.190 --> 05:17:58.959
WHICH IS MORE GLOBAL IN NATURE

05:17:59.026 --> 05:18:02.163
-- WE ALSO -- SEE THAT OUR

05:18:02.229 --> 05:18:03.931
MEDICARE PROGRAM IS GONNA GOING

05:18:03.998 --> 05:18:06.834
IN THAT DIRECTION YET WE WE

05:18:06.901 --> 05:18:08.269
KIND OF HAVE YOU HAVE A FEE FOR

05:18:08.335 --> 05:18:10.070
SERVICE COMPONENT HERE AND A

05:18:10.137 --> 05:18:12.139
SALARY COMPONENT AND THAT'S NOT

05:18:12.206 --> 05:18:13.774
NECESSARILY CONSISTENT WITH THE

05:18:13.841 --> 05:18:16.277
WAY HEALTH CARE IS IS INVOLVING

05:18:16.343 --> 05:18:18.379
ON ON A LARGE SCALE THIRTEEN

05:18:18.446 --> 05:18:19.613
FOURTEEN MILLION PEOPLE IN

05:18:19.680 --> 05:18:21.782
MEDICARE WE'RE WE WE'VE MOVED

05:18:21.849 --> 05:18:23.217
AWAY FROM FEE FOR SERVICE

05:18:23.284 --> 05:18:25.920
SO HOW DO YOU ADDRESS MR

05:18:25.986 --> 05:18:29.590
BARCELONA'S CONCERNS IT IS UP

05:18:30.424 --> 05:18:32.460
AS LAID OUT IN THE LEGISLATION

05:18:32.526 --> 05:18:33.694
ALLOWS FOR A VARIETY OF

05:18:33.761 --> 05:18:34.562
DIFFERENT TYPES INCLUDING

05:18:34.628 --> 05:18:35.729
GLOBAL BUDGETING PARTICULARLY

05:18:35.796 --> 05:18:38.365
FOR OF ENTITIES SEVEN HOSPITALS

05:18:38.432 --> 05:18:40.668
WHAT HAVE YOU -- AND I'LL PASS

05:18:40.734 --> 05:18:41.936
IT OVER TO COMMON COMES TO YOU

05:18:42.002 --> 05:18:44.038
AS A PLAYER ROUTED TO ANSWERING

05:18:44.104 --> 05:18:45.806
GREATER DETAIL HOW YOU CAN

05:18:45.873 --> 05:18:47.274
STILL HAVE FEE FOR SERVICE AS

05:18:47.341 --> 05:18:49.443
PART OF THE OVERALL MENU OF

05:18:49.510 --> 05:18:51.178
OPTIONS OF PAYMENT PARTICULARLY

05:18:51.245 --> 05:18:52.046
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

05:18:52.112 --> 05:18:53.347
IN COMMUNITIES THAT MAY NOT

05:18:53.414 --> 05:18:54.381
HAVE A HOSPITAL OR MAY NOT

05:18:54.448 --> 05:18:56.217
HAVE ENTITIES WERE THE GLOBAL

05:18:56.283 --> 05:18:58.786
BUDGETING MAKES AS MUCH SENSE

05:19:01.322 --> 05:19:02.022
HELLO IS MISS

05:19:02.089 --> 05:19:04.091
COMES DOWN THE LINE

05:19:05.493 --> 05:19:08.095
CAN YOU HEAR ME YES HELLO

05:19:08.162 --> 05:19:10.831
CAN YOU HEAR ME YES OUR --

05:19:10.898 --> 05:19:14.101
SO THE ASSUMPTION THAT --

05:19:14.635 --> 05:19:16.904
THAT THE RISK BASED MODEL OF

05:19:16.971 --> 05:19:19.106
MANAGED CARE -- THAT IT IS A

05:19:19.173 --> 05:19:20.741
MODEL THAT WE SHOULD KEEP ON

05:19:20.808 --> 05:19:23.344
PUSHING FORWARD AND EXPAND IN

05:19:23.410 --> 05:19:26.146
CALIFORNIA IS IS ONE THAT WE

05:19:26.213 --> 05:19:28.082
SHOULD REALLY QUESTION BECAUSE

05:19:28.148 --> 05:19:30.184
THAT THE IDEAS MANAGED CARE

05:19:30.251 --> 05:19:31.552
THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN DO COST

05:19:31.619 --> 05:19:34.421
SAVINGS BY -- INTEGRATING THAT

05:19:34.488 --> 05:19:37.525
FINANCIAL INTEREST OF A PLAN

05:19:37.591 --> 05:19:39.393
AND WITH THE FINANCIAL INTEREST

05:19:39.460 --> 05:19:42.229
OF A PROVIDER THAT CREATES A

05:19:42.296 --> 05:19:44.598
FUNDAMENTALLY ETHICAL QUESTION

05:19:44.665 --> 05:19:47.301
WE'RE ASKING PROVIDERS TO --

05:19:47.968 --> 05:19:51.005
TO WAIT THE FINANCIAL LIABILITY

05:19:51.205 --> 05:19:54.141
OF PROVIDING CARE -- WITH HOW

05:19:54.208 --> 05:19:55.409
THEY ACTUALLY PROVIDE CARE SO

05:19:55.476 --> 05:19:56.510
THIRD THROUGH THE FUNDAMENTAL

05:19:56.577 --> 05:19:57.878
QUESTION THERE AND I THINK WE

05:19:57.945 --> 05:19:59.947
CAN ASSUME THAT MANAGED CARE

05:20:00.014 --> 05:20:02.116
IS NECESSARILY GOING TO GET

05:20:02.182 --> 05:20:04.985
US TO TO UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO

05:20:05.052 --> 05:20:07.555
TAKE CARE AND IMPORTANTLY --

05:20:07.621 --> 05:20:08.622
YOU KNOW MANAGED CARES REALLY

05:20:08.689 --> 05:20:11.025
TOUTED AS A SOME SORT OF COST

05:20:11.091 --> 05:20:13.394
SAVINGS AND -- MODEL OR SOME

05:20:13.460 --> 05:20:14.595
MODEL THAT WOULD IMPROVE CARE

05:20:14.662 --> 05:20:15.963
BUT BOTH OF THOSE THINGS HAVE

05:20:16.030 --> 05:20:17.865
BEEN -- HAD NOT BORNE OUT

05:20:17.932 --> 05:20:20.534
IN PRACTICE -- AND I I THINK

05:20:20.601 --> 05:20:22.970
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO --

05:20:23.037 --> 05:20:25.139
EMPHASIZED THAT -- THAT THE

05:20:25.205 --> 05:20:26.974
COST SAVINGS POTENTIAL FOR

05:20:27.041 --> 05:20:28.776
A DIRECT PAYMENTS MODEL THAT

05:20:28.842 --> 05:20:30.477
INCLUDES GLOBAL BUDGETING

05:20:30.678 --> 05:20:32.780
INCLUDES THAT FEE FOR SERVICE

05:20:32.846 --> 05:20:35.115
AT THAT INCLUDES A MIX OF THESE

05:20:35.182 --> 05:20:36.984
TYPES OF DIRECT PAYMENT MODELS

05:20:37.051 --> 05:20:38.719
-- AND YOU KNOW VERY WELL --

05:20:38.786 --> 05:20:40.621
-- DOCTOR WOULD AS BOTH YOU

05:20:40.688 --> 05:20:41.622
AND I SERVE ON THE HEALTHY

05:20:41.689 --> 05:20:43.223
CALIFORNIA FOR ALL COMMISSION

05:20:43.290 --> 05:20:44.959
AND WE DISCUSSED THIS AT LENGTH

05:20:45.025 --> 05:20:47.461
-- THE OUR CONSULTANTS ON THE

05:20:47.528 --> 05:20:48.963
COMMISSION HAVE FOUND THAT THE

05:20:49.029 --> 05:20:50.631
-- THE DIRECT PAYMENTS MODEL

05:20:50.698 --> 05:20:52.800
WOULD ACTUALLY SAVE MORE THAN

05:20:52.866 --> 05:20:54.602
A MANAGED CARE MODEL IN TERMS

05:20:54.668 --> 05:20:57.938
OF COST SAVINGS SO -- AT THAT

05:20:58.005 --> 05:21:00.007
IS A REALLY KEEP OUR QUESTION

05:21:00.074 --> 05:21:01.809
TO ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND ONE

05:21:01.875 --> 05:21:03.410
PICK ONE FOLKS SAY THAT IT

05:21:03.477 --> 05:21:04.979
WOULD SAVE CALIFORNIA MORE

05:21:05.045 --> 05:21:06.814
MONEY TO EXPAND MANAGED CARE

05:21:06.880 --> 05:21:09.550
ON THE SUBSTANTIVE MATTER OF

05:21:09.617 --> 05:21:12.219
MANAGED CARE YOU KNOW BECAUSE

05:21:12.453 --> 05:21:14.154
THEY THE MODEL IS BASED ON A

05:21:14.221 --> 05:21:16.557
RISK BASED TYPE OF -- INCENTIVE

05:21:16.624 --> 05:21:20.361
PAYMENT -- WE'RE REALLY RELYING

05:21:20.427 --> 05:21:24.031
ON THAT THE INSURERS AND THE

05:21:24.098 --> 05:21:27.668
PLANS -- TO TWO WOMEN AT THE

05:21:27.735 --> 05:21:30.304
KNIGHT CARE IN ORDER -- --

05:21:30.371 --> 05:21:33.374
IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE -- THEIR

05:21:33.440 --> 05:21:35.309
PROFIT MARGINS AND THAT IS

05:21:35.376 --> 05:21:36.810
SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO GO

05:21:36.877 --> 05:21:39.279
AWAY FROM -- WITH OUR HOSPITAL

05:21:39.346 --> 05:21:41.448
GLOBAL BUDGETING AND THE SALARY

05:21:41.515 --> 05:21:43.150
PAYMENTS ALONG WITH IF YOU

05:21:43.217 --> 05:21:46.220
FOR SERVICE -- PAYMENTS SO --

05:21:46.520 --> 05:21:49.189
BUILDER LARGELY -- QUESTIONS

05:21:49.256 --> 05:21:52.026
THAT THAT REALLY -- CHANGING

05:21:52.092 --> 05:21:53.327
THE PAYMENT MODEL ON CHANGING

05:21:53.394 --> 05:21:55.729
THE PAYMENT STRUCTURE IS HOW WE

05:21:55.796 --> 05:21:57.197
-- ENSURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY

05:21:57.264 --> 05:21:58.866
GETTING -- PAYMENTS TOWARDS

05:21:58.932 --> 05:22:01.168
CARE RATHER THAN -- BLOWING

05:22:01.235 --> 05:22:02.603
TOWARDS THINGS OTHER THAN CARE

05:22:02.670 --> 05:22:04.505
AND WE HAVE LOTS OF STUDIES

05:22:04.571 --> 05:22:07.107
THIS STUDY -- FROM -- OUR

05:22:07.174 --> 05:22:09.009
CONSULTANTS ON THE COMMISSION

05:22:09.076 --> 05:22:11.211
-- RICK KRONIG EVEN SAID THAT

05:22:11.278 --> 05:22:14.181
THESE EXTRA PAYMENT -- THESE

05:22:14.248 --> 05:22:16.850
-- THE ACT ACCESS PAYMENTS

05:22:17.084 --> 05:22:18.952
ABOVE -- WHAT IS ACTUALLY

05:22:19.019 --> 05:22:20.888
PAID FOR CARE IN MANAGED CARE

05:22:20.954 --> 05:22:22.990
MODELS -- PARTICULARLY AND

05:22:23.057 --> 05:22:24.625
MEDICARE ADVANTAGE MODELS AS

05:22:24.692 --> 05:22:26.160
AS AN EXAMPLE THEY ACTUALLY

05:22:26.226 --> 05:22:28.395
GO TOWARDS -- HOSPITAL PROFIT

05:22:28.462 --> 05:22:30.097
MARGINS AND NOT BACK TOWARDS

05:22:30.164 --> 05:22:32.299
PATIENTS SO THERE ISN'T REALLY

05:22:32.366 --> 05:22:34.301
PROOF THAT MANAGED CARE REALLY

05:22:34.368 --> 05:22:37.438
EFFECTIVELY GET MORE CARE OR

05:22:37.504 --> 05:22:38.972
THAT IT COMPENSATES COST FOR

05:22:39.039 --> 05:22:42.876
THE FOR THE STATE OKAY --

05:22:42.943 --> 05:22:44.078
THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT

05:22:44.144 --> 05:22:46.647
FOR THAT ANSWER -- HOW DO YOU

05:22:46.714 --> 05:22:48.248
ENVISION MAKE WHO COULD YOU

05:22:48.315 --> 05:22:49.783
ENVISION ADMINISTERING FOR

05:22:49.850 --> 05:22:52.119
THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF OF THIS

05:22:52.186 --> 05:22:53.387
-- GOING FORWARD ARE YOU KIND

05:22:53.454 --> 05:22:54.621
ARE YOU OPEN TO AN ENTITY LIKE

05:22:54.688 --> 05:22:57.057
COVERED CALIFORNIA OR OR DO YOU

05:22:57.124 --> 05:22:59.560
ENVISION A A DEDICATED STATE

05:22:59.626 --> 05:23:02.996
AGENCY TO TO TO ADMINISTER

05:23:03.063 --> 05:23:06.567
THIS THIS PLAN YES -- UNDER

05:23:06.633 --> 05:23:09.269
THE LEGISLATION IT WOULD SET

05:23:09.336 --> 05:23:10.971
UP THE CAL CARE BOARD THAT

05:23:11.038 --> 05:23:12.439
ARE APPOINTEES HOWEVER IT DOES

05:23:12.506 --> 05:23:15.008
NOT LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO

05:23:15.075 --> 05:23:17.678
HAVE YOU KNOW OTHER KIND OF

05:23:17.745 --> 05:23:19.980
AT THAT THE OTHER ENTITIES OR

05:23:20.047 --> 05:23:22.149
OTHER BOARDS OR SUBCOMMITTEE'S

05:23:22.216 --> 05:23:24.785
TOP OPERATED AND I THINK THAT

05:23:24.852 --> 05:23:27.387
RIGHT NOW IT DOES ALLOW FOR YOU

05:23:27.454 --> 05:23:28.422
THEY'RE ALREADY JUST LIKE AN

05:23:28.489 --> 05:23:30.023
APARTMENT MANAGE HEALTHCARE OR

05:23:30.090 --> 05:23:31.658
WHAT HAVE YOU THERE'S NO REASON

05:23:31.725 --> 05:23:33.260
WHY THE EXISTING ENTITIES

05:23:33.327 --> 05:23:34.862
THAT CURRENTLY EXIST CAN ALSO

05:23:34.928 --> 05:23:37.064
BE PART OF THE MANAGEMENT

05:23:37.131 --> 05:23:38.031
OF THE SYSTEM AND THAT'S

05:23:38.098 --> 05:23:40.067
SOMETHING WHERE YOU KNOW THE

05:23:40.134 --> 05:23:41.902
THE CAL CARE BOARD CAN HELP

05:23:41.969 --> 05:23:43.170
TO DEVISE THE SET UP THAT

05:23:43.237 --> 05:23:44.438
ALLOWS FOR THAT AND I WOULD

05:23:44.505 --> 05:23:46.006
ASK MISS KANSI TO MOVE INTO

05:23:46.073 --> 05:23:49.076
ALLOWED RIGHT ON THAT AS WELL

05:23:50.210 --> 05:23:52.880
SURE -- I THINK WHEN WE'RE

05:23:52.946 --> 05:23:54.448
TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHO

05:23:54.515 --> 05:23:56.150
WOULD BE ABLE TO MANAGE THE

05:23:56.216 --> 05:23:57.217
PROGRAM YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY

05:23:57.284 --> 05:23:59.086
GIVING FLEXIBILITY AND IN

05:23:59.153 --> 05:24:01.622
THE THE BILL -- FOR THE POOR

05:24:01.688 --> 05:24:03.390
PROTECT YOU KNOW INCORPORATE

05:24:03.457 --> 05:24:05.959
IF NECESSARY -- EXISTING

05:24:06.426 --> 05:24:08.362
GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES AND --

05:24:08.428 --> 05:24:11.698

OFFICES THAT ALREADY EXIST --

05:24:15.102 --> 05:24:16.403
FOR EXAMPLE I THINK A REALLY

05:24:16.470 --> 05:24:18.105
GOOD EXAMPLE IS THE DEPARTMENT

05:24:18.172 --> 05:24:19.606
OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE -- AS

05:24:19.673 --> 05:24:22.109
I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY

05:24:22.176 --> 05:24:25.045
-- FOR -- INDEPENDENT MEDICAL

05:24:25.345 --> 05:24:28.682
REVIEWS -- THAT THE BOARD WOULD

05:24:28.749 --> 05:24:29.883
CONSULT WITH THE DEPARTMENT

05:24:29.950 --> 05:24:31.451
OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE SO YOU

05:24:31.518 --> 05:24:33.253
KNOW IT IS NOT PART WE COULD

05:24:33.320 --> 05:24:36.223
TRY TO BRING IN THE THE SYSTEMS

05:24:36.290 --> 05:24:38.458
THAT EXIST ALREADY -- AND AND

05:24:38.525 --> 05:24:40.093
NOT NECESSARILY RECREATE THE

05:24:40.160 --> 05:24:42.629
REGULATORY WILL -- AND YOU KNOW

05:24:42.696 --> 05:24:45.833
FOR THE MHC -- THAT WHAT WOULD

05:24:45.899 --> 05:24:47.134
BE HAPPENING THERE IS THAT

05:24:47.201 --> 05:24:48.435
YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF MANAGING

05:24:48.502 --> 05:24:51.071
A HUNDRED PLUS PLANS -- THE

05:24:51.138 --> 05:24:52.906
PEOPLE MANAGING ONE PLANNED SO

05:24:52.973 --> 05:24:54.208
YOU KNOW THAT THEIR STRUCTURES

05:24:54.274 --> 05:24:56.543
THERE -- YOU KNOW WERE ALSO AT

05:24:56.610 --> 05:24:58.478
AND MANY PART TIME IN THE BILL

05:24:58.545 --> 05:25:00.280
WE REFER TO EXISTING STATUTE

05:25:00.347 --> 05:25:01.815
AGAIN LIKE MEDICAID THE MEDIC

05:25:01.882 --> 05:25:03.984
HOW -- CONSUMER PROTECTIONS

-- AND YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE

05:25:05.419 --> 05:25:06.553
TRYING TO BUILD OFF OF WHAT WE

05:25:06.620 --> 05:25:08.488
HAVE AND AND OF COURSE THERE'S

05:25:08.555 --> 05:25:09.923
THERE'S YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE

05:25:09.990 --> 05:25:11.225
SOMETHING THAT IS WORKING THAT

05:25:11.291 --> 05:25:12.459
WE WANT TO BRING IT INTO THE

05:25:12.526 --> 05:25:14.661
ACCOUNT HERE PROGRAM OKAY THANK

05:25:14.728 --> 05:25:17.431
YOU AND -- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY

05:25:17.497 --> 05:25:19.600
OUR ANALYSIS LAYS OUT A LOT

05:25:19.666 --> 05:25:21.501
A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND AND

05:25:21.568 --> 05:25:22.903
-- AND WHEN I GET TO THAT IN

05:25:22.970 --> 05:25:24.404
MY COMMENTS BUT I WANT FOR

05:25:24.471 --> 05:25:25.339
THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE SOME

05:25:25.405 --> 05:25:26.473
COMMENTS AND SO I THINK THE

05:25:26.540 --> 05:25:27.708
COMMITTEE FURTHER INDULGENCE

05:25:27.774 --> 05:25:30.244
THIS IS A -- OBVIOUSLY A LONG

05:25:30.310 --> 05:25:31.578
HEARING BUT THIS IS I THINK A

05:25:31.645 --> 05:25:33.213
VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC AND THAT

05:25:33.280 --> 05:25:34.715
IS A SIMPLE QUESTION ABOUT

05:25:34.781 --> 05:25:37.117
PORTABILITY WHAT HAPPENS IF

05:25:37.184 --> 05:25:38.552
YOU'RE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA

05:25:38.619 --> 05:25:39.620
AND HAVE CAL CARE AND GO

05:25:39.686 --> 05:25:40.621
SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THE REASON

05:25:40.687 --> 05:25:42.456
I ASK THIS QUESTION IS THAT IF

05:25:42.522 --> 05:25:43.690
YOU'RE A CITIZEN OF CANADA AND

05:25:43.757 --> 05:25:45.726
COME HERE YOUR COVERAGE IS VERY

05:25:45.792 --> 05:25:48.762
LIMITED FOR EXAMPLE -- IF YOU

05:25:48.829 --> 05:25:50.430
GET FIFTY DOLLARS FOR EMERGENCY

05:25:50.497 --> 05:25:52.232

05:25:58.338 --> 05:25:58.839
K.

05:25:59.239 --> 05:26:01.074
SO HOW DO YOU ENVISION WHAT

05:26:01.141 --> 05:26:02.542
DO YOU ENVISION FOR PEOPLE WHO

05:26:02.609 --> 05:26:04.278

CONTEMPLATES THAT IN ORDER

05:26:12.019 --> 05:26:13.287

HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS

05:27:32.032 --> 05:27:32.933
KIND OF FORGOTTEN THAT

05:27:33.000 --> 05:27:35.502
OATH AND LOST ITS WAY

YOU HEARD SOME OF THAT THIS

05:27:58.191 --> 05:28:00.260
EVENING I THINK THEIR ANGER

05:28:00.327 --> 05:28:02.896
IS JUSTIFIED WE NEED TO HEAR

05:28:02.963 --> 05:28:05.966

05:28:22.883 --> 05:28:25.252
OUT AT THE SYSTEM THE SYSTEM

05:28:25.318 --> 05:28:27.821
HAS A PERVERSE INCENTIVE ON

05:28:27.888 --> 05:28:30.757
MEDICATIONS IT'S CRAZY THAT

05:28:30.824 --> 05:28:32.259
A DRUG MANUFACTURER PRODUCES

05:28:32.325 --> 05:28:34.227
A DRUG AND THEN A MIDDLEMAN

05:28:34.294 --> 05:28:36.163
DECIDES IF IT CAN GO ON YOUR

05:28:36.229 --> 05:28:37.597
FORMULARY SO THAT YOU AS A

05:28:37.664 --> 05:28:40.367
CONSUMER CAN GET IT AND WE

05:28:40.434 --> 05:28:42.369
KNOW FROM OUR RESEARCH THAT

05:28:42.436 --> 05:28:43.770
THOSE MIDDLEMAN THE PHARMACY

05:28:43.837 --> 05:28:47.240
BENEFIT MANAGERS TAKE THE

05:28:47.307 --> 05:28:49.609
HIGHEST PRICED DRUGS BECAUSE

05:28:49.676 --> 05:28:50.977
THEY GET THE BIGGEST REBATES

05:28:51.044 --> 05:28:53.113
FOR THAT NOT THE LOWEST LOWER

05:28:53.180 --> 05:28:54.448
PRICED DRUGS IT MAY BE MORE

05:28:54.514 --> 05:28:55.615
EFFECTIVE THEY TAKE THE HIGH

05:28:55.682 --> 05:28:56.650
ONES BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THEY

05:28:56.716 --> 05:28:58.251
MAKE THEIR MONEY IT IS NO

05:28:58.318 --> 05:29:00.587
ACCIDENT THAT THE THREE LARGEST

05:29:00.654 --> 05:29:02.489
PBMS IN THE UNITED STATES WITH

05:29:02.556 --> 05:29:04.057
TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY BILLION

05:29:04.124 --> 05:29:06.293
DOLLARS WORTH OF BUSINESS OUR

05:29:06.359 --> 05:29:08.562
FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES

05:29:10.897 --> 05:29:12.232
ANYWAY ORIGINALLY THEY WERE

05:29:12.299 --> 05:29:14.034
DESIGNED IN A WAY TO ACTUALLY

05:29:14.101 --> 05:29:16.369
BRING A VALUE BUT SOMEWHERE

05:29:16.436 --> 05:29:18.238
ALONG THE WAY THEY WENT OFF IN

05:29:18.305 --> 05:29:19.806
A DIRECTION THAT ISN'T HELPFUL

05:29:19.873 --> 05:29:22.242
FOR CONSUMERS CAN I HAVE A

05:29:22.309 --> 05:29:25.212
I'M A FAMILY MEMBER WHO -- YOU

05:29:25.278 --> 05:29:27.414
KNOW CALLED ME AND SAID HEY

SOME SURGERY AND -- -- HOW DO

05:29:32.552 --> 05:29:33.386
I FIND OUT HOW MUCH IT'S GONNA

05:29:33.453 --> 05:29:36.556
COST AND I SAID WELL YOU CAN

05:29:36.623 --> 05:29:38.758
TALK YOU CAN ASK YOUR DOCTOR

05:29:38.825 --> 05:29:40.193
AND I SAID -- AND I SAID AND

05:29:40.260 --> 05:29:40.894
THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO

05:29:40.961 --> 05:29:43.296
HOUSE THE HEALTH FACILITY WAIT

05:29:43.363 --> 05:29:44.498
THE OUTPATIENT SURGERY CENTER

05:29:44.564 --> 05:29:45.132
WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GET

05:29:45.198 --> 05:29:47.734
THAT AND BY THE WAY YOU MIGHT

05:29:47.801 --> 05:29:49.402
NOT MEET THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST

05:29:49.469 --> 05:29:50.670
UNTIL THE DAY OF THE SURGERY

05:29:50.737 --> 05:29:51.338
SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE

05:29:51.404 --> 05:29:54.407
ABLE TO FIGURE THAT ONE OUT

05:29:56.409 --> 05:29:57.644
WE PUT OUR FAITH IN THE

05:29:57.711 --> 05:30:00.013
SYSTEM AND WE DON'T HAVE A

05:30:00.080 --> 05:30:01.915
CLUE WHAT IS GOING TO COST TO

05:30:01.982 --> 05:30:05.452
ME GO WHAT ELSE IN OUR WORLD

05:30:05.519 --> 05:30:07.854
DO WE ACTUALLY DO -- WHERE

05:30:07.921 --> 05:30:08.788
THAT WILL BE DUE THAT WE PUT

05:30:08.855 --> 05:30:10.957
TREMENDOUS FAITH IN THE SYSTEM

05:30:11.024 --> 05:30:12.592
AND OUR WONDERFUL PROVIDERS

05:30:12.659 --> 05:30:14.461
HOSPITALS PROVIDE INCREDIBLE

05:30:14.528 --> 05:30:16.596
SERVICES DRUG COMPANIES PROVIDE

05:30:16.663 --> 05:30:18.498
INCREDIBLE LIFESAVING DRUGS

05:30:18.865 --> 05:30:21.301
DOCTORS DO WONDERFUL THINGS TO

05:30:21.368 --> 05:30:24.371
HELP SAVE LIVES YEAH WE CAN'T

05:30:24.437 --> 05:30:25.272
TELL PEOPLE WHAT IT'S GOING

05:30:25.338 --> 05:30:26.907
TO COST YOU KNOW THERE WAS

05:30:26.973 --> 05:30:29.209
A BILL PASSED BY THE FEDERAL

05:30:29.276 --> 05:30:31.044
GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR THAT

05:30:31.111 --> 05:30:33.613
SAID THAT HOSPITALS NEED TO

05:30:34.014 --> 05:30:35.248
DISPLAY THEIR PRIDE THERE THEIR

05:30:35.315 --> 05:30:37.717
PRICES IF THE TRANSPARENCY

05:30:37.784 --> 05:30:41.288
BILLS A YEAR LATER HALF OF THE

05:30:41.354 --> 05:30:43.256
HOSPITALS IT EITHER IGNORED

05:30:43.323 --> 05:30:45.725
THAT WERE BURIED SO DEEP THAT

05:30:45.792 --> 05:30:46.793
THE AVERAGE CONSUMER CAN'T

05:30:46.860 --> 05:30:48.562
FIND IT WE'RE JUST DECIDED

05:30:48.628 --> 05:30:50.330
THAT THE FINES ARE WORTH THE

05:30:50.397 --> 05:30:53.934
COST OF DOING BUSINESS THESE

05:30:54.000 --> 05:30:55.502
ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT

05:30:55.569 --> 05:30:58.238
DRIVE ME ABSOLUTELY CRAZY

05:31:00.407 --> 05:31:02.442
IT FEELS MORE AND MORE THAT WE

05:31:02.509 --> 05:31:04.411
ARE SECOND WE ARE SACRIFICING

05:31:04.477 --> 05:31:06.112
TO HELP THE PATIENTS AND THEIR

05:31:06.179 --> 05:31:08.415
PRIORITIES FOR PRESERVING THE

05:31:08.481 --> 05:31:11.318
STATUS QUO IN OUR INSURANCE

05:31:11.384 --> 05:31:12.485
COMPANIES TELL PEOPLE WHAT

05:31:12.552 --> 05:31:14.688
THEY CAN AND CANNOT HALF

05:31:14.754 --> 05:31:15.989
THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES

05:31:16.056 --> 05:31:17.824
CONTINUE TO INCREASE PRICES

05:31:17.891 --> 05:31:19.092
AND MY FRUSTRATION WITH THE

05:31:19.159 --> 05:31:20.193
BILL THAT WE WERE TALKING

05:31:20.260 --> 05:31:21.695
ABOUT EARLIER IS THERE IS

05:31:21.761 --> 05:31:23.530
NO INCENTIVE FOR THE DRUG

05:31:23.597 --> 05:31:25.131
COMPANIES TO ACTUALLY LOWER

05:31:25.198 --> 05:31:27.534
PRICES AND I FEAR THAT THE

05:31:27.601 --> 05:31:29.069
POLICY MIX WOULD DRIVE PEOPLE

05:31:29.135 --> 05:31:31.204
MORE TOWARDS HIGH PRICE DRUGS

05:31:31.271 --> 05:31:32.372
RATHER THAN GENERICS THAT

05:31:32.439 --> 05:31:33.740
MIGHT BE AVAILABLE BECAUSE

05:31:33.807 --> 05:31:35.575
THEY MIGHT GET A REBATE

05:31:35.642 --> 05:31:36.943
THAT'S A PERVERSE INCENTIVE

05:31:37.010 --> 05:31:38.645
POTENTIALLY AND WE'LL SEE HOW

05:31:38.712 --> 05:31:41.214
THAT COULD HAVE THAT PLAYS OUT

05:31:41.281 --> 05:31:42.649
OBVIOUSLY I JUST SAT HOSPITALS

05:31:42.716 --> 05:31:44.818
IGNORE TRANSPARENCY LAWS --

05:31:44.884 --> 05:31:45.986
PHYSICIANS DON'T WANT THEIR

05:31:46.052 --> 05:31:48.054
DECISIONS QUESTION BY ANYONE

05:31:48.355 --> 05:31:49.289
AND THAT'S CERTAIN THAT'S A

05:31:49.356 --> 05:31:51.891
REALITY I SPENT SEVEN YEARS

05:31:51.958 --> 05:31:52.859
IN THE LEGISLATURE TRYING TO

05:31:52.926 --> 05:31:55.028
MAKE IT WORK FOR PATIENTS SPENT

05:31:55.095 --> 05:31:56.630
TWENTY SEVEN YEARS BEFORE THAT

05:31:56.696 --> 05:31:58.698
DELIVERING DIRECT PATIENT CARE

05:31:59.399 --> 05:32:00.734
THE BATTLES IN THIS BUILDING

05:32:00.800 --> 05:32:02.702
HAVE BEEN BRUTAL AND ALTHOUGH

05:32:02.769 --> 05:32:04.437
WE'VE HAD SIGNIFICANT SUCCESSES

05:32:04.504 --> 05:32:05.372
EACH ONE OF THE PLAYERS

05:32:05.438 --> 05:32:06.706
IN A MAJOR PIECE ELECTION

05:32:06.773 --> 05:32:08.775
LEGISLATION THAT I TAKE THAT

05:32:08.842 --> 05:32:10.677
I'VE ACCOMPLISHED HAVE BEEN

05:32:10.744 --> 05:32:12.312
REWARDED WITH A LAWSUIT TO

05:32:12.379 --> 05:32:15.181
DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION ONE

05:32:15.248 --> 05:32:16.916
REGULAR OR FORTY OR CONTINUING

05:32:16.983 --> 05:32:18.652
REGULATORY CHALLENGES TO DELAY

05:32:18.718 --> 05:32:20.720
THE IMPLEMENTATION SO THEY CAN

05:32:20.787 --> 05:32:23.456
KEEP CONTINUE THESE PRACTICES

05:32:24.691 --> 05:32:26.693
AND PROTECT THEIR PROFITS

05:32:27.927 --> 05:32:29.863
FIXING INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS

05:32:29.929 --> 05:32:32.198
OF THE SYSTEM AND HOPING IT

05:32:32.265 --> 05:32:35.135
IMPROVES THE WHOLE NO LONGER

05:32:35.201 --> 05:32:36.503
SEEMS TO BE AN EFFECTIVE

05:32:36.569 --> 05:32:39.205
APPROACH THAT'S WHY AFTER

05:32:39.272 --> 05:32:40.940
NEARLY EIGHT YEARS OF TRYING TO

05:32:41.007 --> 05:32:41.941
MAKE HEALTH CARE WORK FOR ALL

YET HEALTHCARE ENTITIES FIGHT

05:34:51.237 --> 05:34:52.972
THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE

05:34:53.039 --> 05:34:54.841
UP THE INFORMATION THEY DON'T

05:34:54.908 --> 05:34:56.409
WANT TO COOPERATE BECAUSE AS

PART OF THEIR BUSINESS MODEL

05:34:57.944 --> 05:34:59.512
TO PROTECT WHAT THEY CONSIDER

05:34:59.579 --> 05:35:01.581
PROPRIETARY THAT IS NOT THE

05:35:01.648 --> 05:35:02.515

RECTIFY TAKING AWAY ONE OF THE

05:40:24.470 --> 05:40:25.772

NO INCENTIVE THERE'S NO

05:41:03.276 --> 05:41:04.644
PROTECTIONS FOR THAT WHAT ABOUT

05:41:04.710 --> 05:41:06.612
THE CALPERS MEMBERS IT MOVED

05:41:06.679 --> 05:41:08.247
OUT OF STATE WHAT ARE THEY

05:41:08.314 --> 05:41:09.982
GONNA DO PEOPLE THIS SPEND

05:41:10.049 --> 05:41:12.351
THEIR ENTIRE LIVES IN INTO THE

05:41:12.418 --> 05:41:14.654
SYSTEM AND WE'RE GOING TO RIP

05:41:14.720 --> 05:41:15.721
THE CARPET OUT FROM UNDERNEATH

05:41:15.788 --> 05:41:18.858
THEM FOR A PROGRAM THERE IS

05:41:18.925 --> 05:41:20.993
EVEN FUND WE DON'T EVEN HAVE

05:41:21.060 --> 05:41:22.728
A CLUE WHAT THIS THING'S GONNA

05:41:22.795 --> 05:41:24.363
COST BECAUSE WE HAVE AN ALLOW

05:41:24.430 --> 05:41:26.599
THE BUILDING TO DO A COST

05:41:26.666 --> 05:41:29.902
ANALYSIS ON THE SOME I AM

05:41:30.169 --> 05:41:32.305
DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS

05:41:33.005 --> 05:41:34.974
THERE IS SO MANY UNANSWERED

05:41:35.041 --> 05:41:36.442
QUESTIONS AND THERE IS A LOT

05:41:36.509 --> 05:41:38.144
OF INCREDIBLY SMART PEOPLE THAT

05:41:38.211 --> 05:41:41.714
I THINK CAN FIGURE IT OUT BUT

05:41:42.148 --> 05:41:44.817
IF WE CARE ABOUT WORKERS LIKE

05:41:44.884 --> 05:41:47.653
I KNOW THAT WE DO HOW ON EARTH

05:41:47.720 --> 05:41:49.655
DO WE GO BACK TO THEM AND SAY

05:41:49.722 --> 05:41:52.592
YOU KNOW WHAT NOW WE'RE GONNA

05:41:52.658 --> 05:41:54.894
CUT TO PENSIONS NO THAT'S LIKE

05:41:54.961 --> 05:41:56.562
A IT'S A IT'S A PRINCIPLE WE

05:41:56.629 --> 05:41:58.798
WOULD NEVER GO DOWN BUT WE'RE

05:41:58.865 --> 05:41:59.899
DOING IT FOR THE HEALTH CARE

05:41:59.966 --> 05:42:01.634
AND FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IS THE

05:42:01.701 --> 05:42:03.069
MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR

05:42:03.135 --> 05:42:04.837
RETIREMENT NOT ONLY THESE

05:42:04.904 --> 05:42:07.406
PEOPLE ON A FIXED INCOME RIGHT

05:42:07.473 --> 05:42:08.207
NOW WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO

05:42:08.274 --> 05:42:11.043
DO SO I GUESS DO THEY HAVE AN

05:42:11.110 --> 05:42:12.912
ABILITY TO KEEP THE CARE THAT

05:42:12.979 --> 05:42:15.982
THEY WALK THAT THEY HAVE NOW

05:42:17.750 --> 05:42:19.652
SO HOW SICK OF THESE I DO

05:42:19.719 --> 05:42:21.053
APPRECIATE YOUR RECOGNITION

05:42:21.120 --> 05:42:22.421
OF OF MY COMMITMENT TO WORKERS

05:42:22.488 --> 05:42:24.290
OBVIOUSLY IS CHAIR LABOR WE

05:42:24.357 --> 05:42:25.758
BOTH -- BUT A LOT OF WORK IN

05:42:25.825 --> 05:42:28.928
THAT REGARD -- CALVET LABOR

05:42:28.995 --> 05:42:30.730
FEDERATION DOESN'T DOORS AND

05:42:30.796 --> 05:42:32.565
SUPPORT AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED

05:42:32.632 --> 05:42:34.033
PART OF THAT IS A COMMITMENT

05:42:34.100 --> 05:42:37.036
TO WORK WITH LABOR -- GOING

05:42:37.103 --> 05:42:38.537
FOR NOT GOING FOR THE OPTION

05:42:38.604 --> 05:42:40.873
IT WITH MANY TIMES OF OF OVER

05:42:40.940 --> 05:42:43.075
THE MONTHS BUT THERE'S A COUPLE

05:42:43.142 --> 05:42:45.111
THINGS ON A READ UP ON THE

05:42:45.177 --> 05:42:46.279
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO NEGOTIATE

05:42:46.345 --> 05:42:48.547
ABSOLUTELY BUT THIS REMEMBER

05:42:48.614 --> 05:42:49.782
BUT WITH LEGISLATIVE DOESN'T

05:42:49.849 --> 05:42:50.816
HAVE TO BE NEGOTIATED IT'LL

05:42:50.883 --> 05:42:53.619
MEAN BY THAT IS IF YOU HAVE

05:42:53.686 --> 05:42:55.988
GUARANTEED QUALITY CARE WHAT I

05:42:56.055 --> 05:42:57.023
WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL SPENT

05:42:57.089 --> 05:42:58.791
OVER HALF OUR TIME THE GOSHEN

05:42:58.858 --> 05:43:01.160
COPAYS PREMIUMS AND TRYING TO

05:43:01.227 --> 05:43:04.764
KEEP THE COSTS DOWN IF THAT IS

05:43:05.164 --> 05:43:06.666
OFF THE TABLE BECAUSE YOU HAVE

05:43:06.732 --> 05:43:08.801
HIGH QUALITY CARE THE NOW YOU

05:43:08.868 --> 05:43:10.102
CAN GO SHAVE OTHER THINGS SO

05:43:10.169 --> 05:43:11.504
THAT'S THAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH

05:43:11.570 --> 05:43:13.406
IN TERMS OF NEGOTIATING CURRENT

05:43:13.472 --> 05:43:14.373
CONTRACT I'M NOT TALK ABOUT

05:43:14.440 --> 05:43:15.708
FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS LITTLE I

05:43:15.775 --> 05:43:16.909
UNDERSTAND ABOUT THINGS HAVE

05:43:16.976 --> 05:43:18.444
ALREADY BEEN NEGOTIATED BY THE

05:43:18.511 --> 05:43:19.845
THERE'S ANOTHER POINT YOU KNOW

05:43:19.912 --> 05:43:21.714
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MENTION

05:43:21.781 --> 05:43:23.082
NEGOTIATIONS I WANT TO MENTION

05:43:23.149 --> 05:43:25.985
THAT SECONDLY SAYING -- PEOPLE

05:43:26.052 --> 05:43:26.886
STAY IN THE JOB BECAUSE THEY

05:43:26.953 --> 05:43:27.653
HAVE GOOD HEALTH CARE THAT'S

05:43:27.720 --> 05:43:29.655
A PROBLEM THAT SHOULD BE THE

05:43:29.722 --> 05:43:31.123
IDEAL THAT SOMEONE STAYS IN

05:43:31.190 --> 05:43:32.792
THEIR JOB BECAUSE OF THE LEAVE

05:43:32.858 --> 05:43:34.794
IT THEY LOSE THEIR HEALTHCARE

05:43:34.860 --> 05:43:35.995
THAT'S A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH

05:43:36.062 --> 05:43:37.430
EMPLOYER BASED HEALTH CARE

05:43:37.496 --> 05:43:40.499
IN OUR COUNTRY UNION OR NOT

05:43:40.566 --> 05:43:41.534
IS THAT IF YOU LEAVE YOUR

05:43:41.600 --> 05:43:43.602
JOB YEAH YOU YOU STAY WITH

05:43:43.669 --> 05:43:44.770

WITH YOUR HEALTH CARE IS A

05:43:45.604 --> 05:43:47.873
MAJOR FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM BUT

05:43:47.940 --> 05:43:49.875
OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM NOW

05:43:49.942 --> 05:43:50.843
WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE THAT

ALREADY HAVE HEALTH CARE AND

05:43:52.511 --> 05:43:53.980
HAVE HEALTHCARE GUARANTEED

05:43:54.046 --> 05:43:54.981
ABSOLUTELY THOSE ARE THINGS

05:43:55.047 --> 05:43:56.716
WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT

05:43:56.782 --> 05:43:59.318
THEY HAVE THE SAME ACCESS SAME

05:43:59.385 --> 05:44:01.153
QUALITY OF CARE AND THE REALITY

05:44:01.220 --> 05:44:03.122
IS UNDER CAL CARE WHAT IS

05:44:03.189 --> 05:44:05.558

THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN THAT'S

05:46:50.189 --> 05:46:51.323
ALSO NOT GONNA HAPPEN ONLY TO

05:46:51.390 --> 05:46:52.324
THERE'S THERE'S TWO POINTS OF

05:46:52.391 --> 05:46:55.394
THAT OLDER SON IS THIS ISN'T

05:46:55.461 --> 05:46:56.729
GOING TO AFFECT AND TOLD THE

05:46:56.795 --> 05:46:59.231
FUNDING IS RESULT IT IS A IT

05:46:59.298 --> 05:47:01.367
IS THAT WAS INTENTIONALLY PUT

05:47:01.433 --> 05:47:04.003
INTO THE BILL TO ENSURE THAT

05:47:04.069 --> 05:47:05.704
WE'RE NOT TAKING SOMETHING AWAY

05:47:05.771 --> 05:47:06.939
WITHOUT ENSURING THAT WE HAVE

05:47:07.006 --> 05:47:08.807
THE SAME QUALITY OF CARE BETTER

05:47:08.874 --> 05:47:10.876
AVAILABLE -- AND SO THAT'S

05:47:10.943 --> 05:47:12.344
WHAT YOU KNOW AND THAT INCLUDES

05:47:12.411 --> 05:47:14.413
GO DISABILITY IT INCLUDES ALL

05:47:14.480 --> 05:47:15.548
THE ISSUES THAT SO MANY OF

05:47:15.614 --> 05:47:17.116
OUR PUBLIC SAFETY REPRESENT

05:47:17.183 --> 05:47:18.584
BY THE WAY IT'S GREAT TO SEE

05:47:18.651 --> 05:47:19.752
HOW PASSIONATE ABOUT WORKERS

05:47:19.818 --> 05:47:20.519
ARE HOPING TO BE LIKE THAT

05:47:20.586 --> 05:47:21.587
ON ALL OF BILLS THAT PROTECT

05:47:21.654 --> 05:47:25.057
WORKERS -- -- BUT -- YOU KNOW

05:47:25.124 --> 05:47:26.892
-- UNLIMITED ALAS ACTION IS

05:47:26.959 --> 05:47:28.861
CONSTANT REGARDS TO BARGAINING

05:47:28.928 --> 05:47:31.730
-- IT UNION BARGAINING IN TERMS

05:47:31.797 --> 05:47:32.565
OF FOURTEEN HUNDRED AS WELL

05:47:32.631 --> 05:47:35.134
IF YOU DON'T MIND RESEARCHER

05:47:42.341 --> 05:47:42.841
M.

05:47:43.342 --> 05:47:45.177
SO YOU DON'T TO ANSWER WHAT

05:47:45.244 --> 05:47:46.879
THE TIMELY MEMBER KALRA SAID

05:47:46.946 --> 05:47:49.181
YOU KNOW AND -- SOMEONE WHO

05:47:49.248 --> 05:47:50.883
REPRESENTS NURSES REPRESENTS

05:47:50.950 --> 05:47:53.185
UNION NURSES ACROSS THE STATE

05:47:53.252 --> 05:47:55.654
-- GETTING HEALTH CARE ACROSS

05:47:55.721 --> 05:47:57.790
THE BARGAINING TABLE WOULD BE

05:47:57.856 --> 05:48:00.726
GAME CHANGING THE VAST MAJORITY

05:48:00.793 --> 05:48:02.394
OF STRIKES ARE ABOUT HEALTHCARE

05:48:02.461 --> 05:48:04.530
BENEFITS AS EMPLOYERS SHIFT

05:48:04.597 --> 05:48:06.232
MORE MORE COSTS ONTO WORKERS

05:48:06.298 --> 05:48:08.000
UNION WORKERS DURING CREEK

05:48:08.067 --> 05:48:09.802
PREMIUMS AND COPAYS ALL THE

05:48:09.868 --> 05:48:11.437
STRIKES WOULD END UNDER EIGHT

05:48:11.503 --> 05:48:12.671
FOURTEEN HUNDRED WORKERS WOULD

05:48:12.738 --> 05:48:14.473
HAVE MORE BARGAINING POWER IT

05:48:14.540 --> 05:48:16.742
WOULD BE BETTER FOR WORKERS

05:48:16.809 --> 05:48:18.811
BECAUSE WE COULD BARGAIN FOR

05:48:18.877 --> 05:48:20.246
BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS

05:48:20.312 --> 05:48:21.647
WHICH WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY

05:48:21.714 --> 05:48:23.082
CRITICAL FOR ALL OF THESE

05:48:23.148 --> 05:48:24.283
ESSENTIAL WORKERS WERE IN

05:48:24.350 --> 05:48:25.951
UNIONS WERE FIGHTING FOR CODE

05:48:26.018 --> 05:48:28.387
PROTECTIONS THIS WOULD MEAN

05:48:28.621 --> 05:48:29.989
YOU KNOW FOR MANY MANY PEOPLE

05:48:30.055 --> 05:48:32.024
WEEK WE COULD GET BETTER

05:48:32.091 --> 05:48:34.526
WORKING CONDITIONS BETTER --

05:48:34.593 --> 05:48:36.495
-- OTHER TYPES OF BENEFITS

05:48:36.562 --> 05:48:37.930
WE COULD END THESE TYPES

05:48:37.997 --> 05:48:39.999
OF STRIKES THAT OUR OUR OUR

05:48:40.065 --> 05:48:41.934
EMPLOYERS ARE PUTTING HONEST

05:48:42.001 --> 05:48:45.337
AND TRYING TO -- LEAN DOWN THE

05:48:45.404 --> 05:48:47.640
THE POWER OF WORKERS ACROSS

05:48:47.706 --> 05:48:49.375
CALIFORNIA AND IT WOULD BE A

05:48:49.441 --> 05:48:51.176
BOON TO CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS

05:48:51.243 --> 05:48:53.279
AND ANSWERED PLAYERS BECAUSE

05:48:53.345 --> 05:48:55.681
IT WOULD SAVE ON PREMIUM

05:48:55.748 --> 05:48:57.483
BOTH ON THE EMPLOYER SIDE AND

05:48:57.549 --> 05:48:59.718
ON THE EMPLOYEE SIDE SO YOU

05:48:59.785 --> 05:49:01.120
KNOW IT WOULD BE A WIN WIN

05:49:01.186 --> 05:49:03.522
FOR BOTH WORKERS AND AND AND

05:49:03.589 --> 05:49:05.291
EMPLOYERS BECAUSE WE WILL AT

HAVE A REAL GREAT TRACK

05:49:13.699 --> 05:49:14.867
RECORD RECENTLY PROVIDING

FOCUS ON TWO THINGS BECAUSE I

05:49:34.253 --> 05:49:36.322
BELIEVE THAT MY CONSTITUENTS

05:49:36.388 --> 05:49:38.057
AND OUR SENIORS ACROSS THE

05:49:38.123 --> 05:49:39.291
STATE OF CALIFORNIA DESERVE

05:49:39.358 --> 05:49:41.393
SOME ANSWERS TO SOME VERY

05:49:41.460 --> 05:49:42.594
FUNDAMENTAL AND VERY IMPORTANT

05:49:42.661 --> 05:49:44.363
QUESTIONS TO THEM ROUGHLY

05:49:44.430 --> 05:49:45.631
THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT OF MY

05:49:45.698 --> 05:49:47.700
CONSTITUENTS ARE ON MEDICARE

05:49:48.701 --> 05:49:49.768
I DON'T KNOW THE STATE MY

05:49:49.835 --> 05:49:51.136
NUMBER BUT IT'S PRETTY HIGH

05:49:51.203 --> 05:49:53.105
AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON IT

05:49:53.172 --> 05:49:54.306
AND PEOPLE ARE AGING INTO IT

05:49:54.373 --> 05:49:56.809
EVERY SINGLE DAY YOUR BILL AB

05:49:56.875 --> 05:49:58.410
FOURTEEN HUNDRED WOULD SUBSUME

05:49:58.477 --> 05:50:01.080
MEDICARE IT WOULD TAKE IT AWAY

05:50:01.146 --> 05:50:02.481

STATED IN YOUR ANSWER THE LAST

05:50:03.849 --> 05:50:05.784
QUESTION I WOULD PUT EVERYTHING

05:50:05.851 --> 05:50:08.854
UNDER CALCULAR SO THAT RAISES

05:50:08.921 --> 05:50:10.522
SOME FUNDAMENTAL AND IMPORTANT

05:50:10.589 --> 05:50:13.625
QUESTIONS TO ME THE FIRST IS

05:50:13.692 --> 05:50:15.494
MEDICARE IS A IS A COMPACT

05:50:16.795 --> 05:50:18.330
CONTACT SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY

05:50:18.397 --> 05:50:20.966

WAY UP UNTIL YOUR RETIREMENT

YOU PAY A PAYROLL TAX AND

05:50:31.610 --> 05:50:32.644
YOUR EMPLOYER PAYS A PAYROLL

05:50:32.711 --> 05:50:35.647
TAX AND THAT MOSTLY FUNDS THE

05:50:35.714 --> 05:50:38.517
MEDICARE PROGRAM IN ADDITION

05:50:38.584 --> 05:50:39.885
TO SOME SUPPLEMENTAL GENERAL

05:50:39.952 --> 05:50:41.954
TAX REVENUES FROM CONGRESS

05:50:42.221 --> 05:50:44.523
SO YOU PAY INTO THAT AND IF

05:50:44.590 --> 05:50:46.191
YOU'RE NEARING THE AGE WHERE

05:50:46.258 --> 05:50:47.559
YOU QUALIFY TO MEDICARE OR

05:50:47.626 --> 05:50:48.994
YOU'RE ALREADY IN THE SYSTEM

05:50:49.061 --> 05:50:51.330
LIKE MY PARENTS FOR EXAMPLE

05:50:51.397 --> 05:50:52.564
YOU'VE PAID YOUR ENTIRE WORKING

05:50:52.631 --> 05:50:54.666
LIFE INTO THAT SYSTEM AND

05:50:54.733 --> 05:50:56.135
NOW IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR BILL

05:50:56.201 --> 05:50:58.470
CORRECTLY WHAT AB FOURTEEN

05:50:58.537 --> 05:50:59.538
HUNDRED WOULD DO IS SAY YOU

05:50:59.605 --> 05:51:01.373

05:51:01.440 --> 05:51:03.208
YOU LIVE IN CALIFORNIA YOU'VE

05:51:03.275 --> 05:51:05.244
GOT TO BE UNDER CAL CARE AN

05:51:05.310 --> 05:51:07.246
UNTESTED UNTRIED EXPERIMENTAL

05:51:07.312 --> 05:51:09.047
SYSTEM IN A STATE THAT BROUGHT

05:51:09.114 --> 05:51:10.349
YOU TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS A

05:51:10.416 --> 05:51:12.518
FRAUD WITH THE ET DE RECENTLY

THE DMV GOING BACK THE ENTIRE

05:51:16.555 --> 05:51:19.458
TIME I'VE BEEN IN OFFICE SO

05:51:19.525 --> 05:51:20.859
THAT SEEMS LIKE A RAW DEAL FOR

05:51:20.926 --> 05:51:22.895
OUR SENIORS MEDICARE THEY'VE

05:51:22.961 --> 05:51:24.396
HAD FIFTY PLUS YEARS TO WORK

05:51:24.463 --> 05:51:26.265
THE KINKS OUT FOR GETTING

05:51:26.331 --> 05:51:28.133
MEDICARE BENEFITS PEOPLE

05:51:28.200 --> 05:51:29.268
AREN'T GENERALLY SPEAKING

05:51:29.334 --> 05:51:30.469
HAPPY WITH THEM THERE ARE SOME

05:51:30.536 --> 05:51:32.704
ISSUES THERE TOO THEY PAY THE

05:51:32.771 --> 05:51:34.373
TAXES TO FUND THAT IN THEIR

05:51:34.440 --> 05:51:35.841
ENTIRE WORKING LIFE HOW ARE

05:51:35.908 --> 05:51:38.210
THEY MADE WHOLE BECAUSE THEY

05:51:38.277 --> 05:51:40.078
ALREADY PAID FOR IT THEY'RE

05:51:40.145 --> 05:51:41.413
GETTING THE MEDICARE BENEFIT

05:51:41.480 --> 05:51:43.182
NOW AND NOW THAT'S TAKEN

05:51:43.248 --> 05:51:45.684
AWAY FROM THEM AND THEY'RE

05:51:45.751 --> 05:51:47.052
GETTING HANDED IF THEY STAY IN

05:51:47.119 --> 05:51:48.320
CALIFORNIA A LOT OF THEM LEAD

05:51:48.387 --> 05:51:49.555
BY THE WAY BUT THEY'RE GETTING

05:51:49.621 --> 05:51:51.457
HANDED A MASSIVE UNPRECEDENTED

05:51:51.523 --> 05:51:53.425
TAX INCREASE IN A PLAYER TO

05:51:53.492 --> 05:51:55.127
BE NAMED LATER IN WHICH IS

05:51:55.194 --> 05:51:56.462
CURRENTLY IF I UNDERSTAND AC

05:51:56.528 --> 05:51:59.565
ELEVEN SO BYE BYE BARGAINED

05:51:59.631 --> 05:52:01.266
FOR BENEFITS LIKE THE UNIONS

05:52:01.333 --> 05:52:03.302
IT'S A SIMILAR TYPE OF THING

05:52:03.368 --> 05:52:04.203
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE THEM

05:52:04.269 --> 05:52:05.971
WHOLE THEY PAID DECADES INTO

05:52:06.038 --> 05:52:07.606
A SYSTEM THEY'RE GETTING CARE

05:52:07.673 --> 05:52:09.808
FOR THAT SYSTEM THEY FOUR WENT

05:52:09.875 --> 05:52:11.243
ADDITIONAL PAY BECAUSE THEY

05:52:11.310 --> 05:52:13.612
BARGAINED IN MANY MANY CASES

05:52:13.679 --> 05:52:15.314
TO HAVE BOTH PUBLIC SECTOR AND

05:52:15.380 --> 05:52:17.182
PRIVATE SECTOR UNION WORKERS

05:52:17.249 --> 05:52:19.184
THE BARGAIN TO TAKE LESS PAY

05:52:19.251 --> 05:52:20.919
AND IT IT IN ORDER TO GET

05:52:20.986 --> 05:52:22.621
BETTER HEALTH CARE AND NOW

05:52:22.688 --> 05:52:23.822
THAT'S BEING STRIPPED AWAY I

05:52:23.889 --> 05:52:26.325
DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN THIS BILL

05:52:26.391 --> 05:52:28.093
THAT MAKES THEM HOLE FOR THAT

05:52:28.160 --> 05:52:29.528
THAT SEEMS LIKE A VERY VERY RAW

05:52:29.595 --> 05:52:31.063
DEAL BOTH FOR OUR SENIORS ON

05:52:31.129 --> 05:52:33.232
MEDICARE AND THE OTHER QUESTION

05:52:33.298 --> 05:52:36.068
I'D LIKE YOU TO ADDRESSES YOU

05:52:36.134 --> 05:52:37.469
KNOW WHY DO WE THINK HEALTHCARE

05:52:37.536 --> 05:52:38.403
IS GOING TO BE BETTER THAN

05:52:38.470 --> 05:52:40.572
MEDICARE WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE

05:52:40.639 --> 05:52:41.974
A FEDERAL SYSTEM THAT'S FUNDED

05:52:42.040 --> 05:52:43.242
BY EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTRY

05:52:43.308 --> 05:52:44.776
THREE OR TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE

05:52:44.843 --> 05:52:46.011
FROM THE DAY THEY START WORKING

05:52:46.078 --> 05:52:47.746
TILL THE DAY THEY RETIRE AND

05:52:47.813 --> 05:52:49.014
AND THAT'S AN ASSURANCE TO THEM

05:52:49.081 --> 05:52:50.516
THAT'S A COMMITMENT THAT'S AN

05:52:50.582 --> 05:52:52.084
INTERGENERATIONAL COMMITMENT

05:52:52.818 --> 05:52:53.952
AND WE'VE BEEN GOING STRONG

05:52:54.019 --> 05:52:55.354
ON THAT FOR FIFTY FIVE PLUS

05:52:55.420 --> 05:52:57.322
YEARS SO WHY ARE WE DOING THIS

05:52:57.389 --> 05:52:58.724
OTHER THING IN CALIFORNIA AND

05:52:58.790 --> 05:53:00.425
REMOVING THAT FROM PEOPLE THEY

05:53:00.492 --> 05:53:01.960
DON'T GET A CHOICE THEY'RE

05:53:02.027 --> 05:53:05.030

UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BETTER I

05:53:14.673 --> 05:53:16.241
READ WHERE THE WILD AND THEN

05:53:16.308 --> 05:53:17.309
THEN YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND

05:53:17.376 --> 05:53:20.379

TO BE A MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND

05:53:29.187 --> 05:53:32.824
STILL -- PAYS OUT OF POCKET FOR

05:53:32.891 --> 05:53:34.793
A NUMBER OF EXPENSES INCLUDING

05:53:34.860 --> 05:53:36.194
PHARMACEUTICALS HE HAS TO

05:53:36.261 --> 05:53:38.764
PAY ON HIS OWN FOR DENTAL AND

05:53:38.830 --> 05:53:41.233
VISION -- HE DOESN'T HAVE LONG

05:53:41.300 --> 05:53:43.201
TERM CARE THERE ANY ISSUES

05:53:43.268 --> 05:53:44.102
THAT ARE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE

05:53:44.169 --> 05:53:46.538
OUT HOW TO PAY FOR CALCULAR

05:53:46.605 --> 05:53:47.873
COVERS ALL THOSE THINGS SO

05:53:47.940 --> 05:53:49.741
WHAT YOU SAY KICK ME OUT OF

05:53:49.808 --> 05:53:51.209
THIS KICK ME OUT OF THAT WHAT

05:53:51.276 --> 05:53:53.312
CALGARIANS IS ADDITIVE IT'S NOT

05:53:53.378 --> 05:53:54.580
SO SHOCKED OF WHAT SOMEONE GETS

05:53:54.646 --> 05:53:55.847
A MEDICARE ACTUALLY GET A WHOLE

05:53:55.914 --> 05:53:57.516
LOT MORE WITHOUT PAYING CO

05:53:57.583 --> 05:54:00.152
PAYS OR PREMIUMS OR DEDUCTIBLES

05:54:00.218 --> 05:54:01.853
OR PAYING FOR PHARMACEUTICALS

05:54:01.920 --> 05:54:03.855
OR PAYING FOR LONG TERM CARE

05:54:03.922 --> 05:54:05.457
AND SO WE CAN USE FEAR AND I

05:54:05.524 --> 05:54:06.758
UNDERSTAND THE FEAR IS A GREAT

05:54:06.825 --> 05:54:08.827
MOTIVATOR TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE

05:54:08.894 --> 05:54:10.762
TO NOT WANT TO CHANGE TOTALLY

05:54:10.829 --> 05:54:12.297
GET THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT

05:54:12.364 --> 05:54:14.766
COMES TO SENIORS HIGH END OF

05:54:14.833 --> 05:54:17.336
THE THAT THAT'S A VERY COMMON

05:54:17.402 --> 05:54:19.638
REFRAINS IS TO USE FEAR BUT

05:54:19.705 --> 05:54:20.839
THE REALITY IS THAT IF YOU

05:54:20.906 --> 05:54:22.341
UNDERSTOOD OUR CURRENT MEDICARE

05:54:22.407 --> 05:54:24.242
SYSTEM ABOUT PEOPLE QUALIFY

05:54:24.309 --> 05:54:25.811
FOR AND LOOK NOT EVERYONE CAN

05:54:25.877 --> 05:54:27.512
AFFORD MEDICARE ADVANTAGE MY

05:54:27.579 --> 05:54:28.580
FATHER'S FORTUNE ENOUGH THAT

05:54:28.647 --> 05:54:30.749
HE CAN'T AND IF YOU CAN'T EVEN

05:54:30.816 --> 05:54:32.918
HAVE A LOT MORE EXPENSES AND

05:54:32.985 --> 05:54:34.252
WHAT HAPPENS IS SENIORS AND UP

05:54:34.319 --> 05:54:36.154
RATIONING AND MANY OF THEM DIED

05:54:36.221 --> 05:54:37.889
PREMATURELY BECAUSE THEY DON'T

05:54:37.956 --> 05:54:39.424
GET THE HEALTHCARE THEY NEED

05:54:39.491 --> 05:54:40.525
EVEN WITH MEDICARE MEDICARE

05:54:40.592 --> 05:54:42.828
IS A SAFETY NET MEDICARE'S NOT

05:54:42.894 --> 05:54:45.230
COMPREHENSIVE CARE NOT IN THE

05:54:45.297 --> 05:54:47.099
WAY THAT CALCAREOUS AND SO I

05:54:47.165 --> 05:54:49.101
WOULD SAY TO EVERYONE THAT NOT

05:54:49.167 --> 05:54:51.036
ONLY ARE YOU NOT AND AND AND

05:54:51.103 --> 05:54:53.271
IF YOU'RE ON MEDICARE -- THAT

05:54:53.338 --> 05:54:54.373
YOU'RE NOT WORKING YOU'RE NOT

05:54:54.439 --> 05:54:56.775
GETTING UP THE PAYROLL TAX

05:54:56.842 --> 05:54:58.310
NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING

05:54:58.377 --> 05:54:59.478
TO IMPACT YOU IN FACT YOU

05:54:59.544 --> 05:55:00.912
COULD HAVE A CALL HUGE COST

05:55:00.979 --> 05:55:02.514
SAVINGS FOR NOT HAVING TO BUY

05:55:02.581 --> 05:55:04.249
SUPPLEMENTAL INSURANCE NOT

05:55:04.316 --> 05:55:05.617
TO BUY THAT OCCURRED VANTAGE

05:55:05.684 --> 05:55:06.852
NOT PAPER PHARMACEUTICALS

05:55:06.918 --> 05:55:08.954
NOT PAPER COPAYS AND PREMIUMS

05:55:09.021 --> 05:55:11.056
BUT IN ANY FORM OR FASHION

05:55:11.123 --> 05:55:12.224
AND SO THE END OF THE DAY YOU

05:55:12.290 --> 05:55:13.692
ARE HAVING A DRAMATIC COST

05:55:13.759 --> 05:55:15.460
SAVINGS WITHIN EXPANSION AND

05:55:15.527 --> 05:55:17.429
THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO YOU

05:55:17.496 --> 05:55:18.664
AND THAT'S WHAT CALCULATES

05:55:18.730 --> 05:55:20.699
OUT QUITE CLEARLY AND IF

05:55:20.766 --> 05:55:22.434
YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT MEDICARE

05:55:22.501 --> 05:55:24.202
IS NOT THIS COMPREHENSIVE

05:55:24.269 --> 05:55:26.071
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AS IT COULD

05:55:26.138 --> 05:55:28.607
BE AND SHOULD BE -- THEN YOU

05:55:28.674 --> 05:55:30.409
UNDERSTAND THAT CALCULATE

05:55:30.475 --> 05:55:32.411
ACTUALLY BE FAR BETTER FOR

05:55:32.477 --> 05:55:36.114
SENIORS THAT ARE ON MEDICARE MY

05:55:36.181 --> 05:55:39.451
OTHER QUESTION IS UP REGARDING

05:55:39.518 --> 05:55:41.386
THE IMPACT THIS BILL WOULD

05:55:41.453 --> 05:55:42.788
POTENTIALLY HAVE ON OUR ABILITY

05:55:42.854 --> 05:55:44.289
TO RECRUIT QUALIFIED MEDICAL

05:55:44.356 --> 05:55:45.957
PROFESSIONALS PROFESSIONALS TO

05:55:46.024 --> 05:55:47.693
MOVE TO CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S

05:55:47.759 --> 05:55:48.827
IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S

05:55:48.894 --> 05:55:50.962
WELL WELL DOCUMENTED IN CERTAIN

05:55:51.029 --> 05:55:53.331
PLACES IN THE STATE BASICALLY

05:55:53.398 --> 05:55:54.700
EVERYWHERE THAT'S RURAL MOST

05:55:54.766 --> 05:55:56.168
OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY A LOT OF

05:55:56.234 --> 05:55:58.403
PLACES YOU CAN'T GET QUALIFIED

05:55:58.470 --> 05:55:59.805
DOCTORS NURSES TO MOVE HERE

05:55:59.871 --> 05:56:01.006
FOR PRACTICALLY ANYTHING IT'S

05:56:01.073 --> 05:56:02.941
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT WE HAVE

05:56:03.008 --> 05:56:05.110
MASSIVE SHORTAGES WE HAVE A

05:56:05.177 --> 05:56:07.012
MAJOR MISMATCH BETWEEN THE

05:56:07.079 --> 05:56:08.980
DISTRIBUTION OF DOCTORS MEDICAL

05:56:09.047 --> 05:56:10.315
SPECIALISTS TO MEET PEOPLE

05:56:10.382 --> 05:56:12.084
WHERE I LIVE -- YOU KNOW THEY

05:56:12.150 --> 05:56:14.453
DRIVE THREE AND A HALF HOURS TO

05:56:14.519 --> 05:56:16.655
SEE A SPECIALIST RIGHT BECAUSE

05:56:16.722 --> 05:56:19.124
THERE AREN'T ANY AROUND SO THE

05:56:19.191 --> 05:56:20.726
HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY EMPLOYS

05:56:20.792 --> 05:56:22.461
ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION WORKERS

05:56:22.527 --> 05:56:23.762
IN CALIFORNIA ROUGHLY TEN

05:56:23.829 --> 05:56:25.230
PERCENT OF OUR WORKFORCE RIGHT

05:56:25.297 --> 05:56:27.265
NOW AND OUR STATE HAS THIS WELL

05:56:27.332 --> 05:56:29.568
DOCUMENTED SHORTAGE SO IF CAL

05:56:29.634 --> 05:56:30.702
CARE BECAME LAW A.

05:56:30.769 --> 05:56:31.303
B.

05:56:31.369 --> 05:56:32.871
FOURTEEN HUNDRED PASSED HOW

05:56:32.938 --> 05:56:34.606
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD IMPACT

05:56:34.673 --> 05:56:36.208
THE ABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO

05:56:36.274 --> 05:56:39.010
RECRUIT AND RETAIN ALL FIVE

05:56:39.077 --> 05:56:41.213
MEDICAL PROVIDERS IT OCCURS TO

05:56:41.279 --> 05:56:42.447
ME THERE ARE SEVERAL PROBLEMS

05:56:42.514 --> 05:56:43.715
FOR ONE THIS IS THE HIGHEST

05:56:43.782 --> 05:56:44.649
COST OF LIVING STATE IN THE

05:56:44.716 --> 05:56:46.918
COUNTRY I TALKED TO A GOOD

05:56:46.985 --> 05:56:48.520
FRIEND OF MINE DOES MEDICAL

05:56:48.587 --> 05:56:49.921
RECRUITING FOR DOCTORS FOR

05:56:49.988 --> 05:56:52.524
HOSPITALS HE SAYS EVERY WINTER

05:56:52.891 --> 05:56:54.292
I GET CALLS FROM A DOCTOR IN

05:56:54.359 --> 05:56:56.828
MICHIGAN OR WISCONSIN AND THEY

05:56:56.895 --> 05:56:57.996
WANT TO MOVE TO SANTA MARIA

05:56:58.063 --> 05:57:00.732
CALIFORNIA TO BE A DOCTOR AND

05:57:00.799 --> 05:57:02.400
THEN THEY REALIZE THEY'RE GONNA

05:57:02.467 --> 05:57:03.902
GET PAID LESS THEY'RE GONNA

05:57:03.969 --> 05:57:05.036
PAY THREE TIMES AS MUCH FOR

05:57:05.103 --> 05:57:06.738
THEIR HOUSE AND WE CAN'T GET

05:57:06.805 --> 05:57:08.940
HIM TO COME HERE NOW WE HAVE

05:57:09.007 --> 05:57:10.408
A LOT OF GREAT DOCTORS NURSES

05:57:10.475 --> 05:57:11.443
AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS

05:57:11.510 --> 05:57:12.344
THAT ARE HERE AND WILLING TO

05:57:12.410 --> 05:57:13.812
HEAR THAT AND AT THAT POINT

05:57:13.879 --> 05:57:15.547
TO STAY AND THAT'S GREAT BUT

05:57:15.614 --> 05:57:17.549
WE WE NEED TO RECRUIT MORE

05:57:17.616 --> 05:57:19.284
THAN AND THEN INDUCE THEM TO

05:57:19.351 --> 05:57:22.287
COME HERE NOW IF THEY COME

05:57:22.354 --> 05:57:24.456
HERE AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE

05:57:24.523 --> 05:57:25.924
ASSURANCE THAT THE SERVICES

05:57:25.991 --> 05:57:27.626
THEY PROVIDE ARE GOING TO BE

05:57:27.692 --> 05:57:29.861
ADEQUATE ADEQUATELY REIMBURSED

05:57:30.061 --> 05:57:31.763
IF FOR ANY STATE SYSTEM THAT IS

05:57:31.830 --> 05:57:33.231
ESSENTIALLY CONTROLLING COSTS

05:57:33.298 --> 05:57:35.233
BY RATIONING CARE BECAUSE I

05:57:35.300 --> 05:57:36.501
THINK YOU HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE

05:57:36.568 --> 05:57:37.636
IT EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD

05:57:37.702 --> 05:57:39.204
HAS SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE

05:57:39.271 --> 05:57:40.839
INCLUDING CANADA WHICH IS

05:57:40.906 --> 05:57:43.408
HELD UP AS THE GOLD STANDARD

05:57:43.475 --> 05:57:45.343
BY MANY PEOPLE ON SINGLE

05:57:45.410 --> 05:57:47.212
PAYER HEALTHCARE IN CANADA

05:57:47.279 --> 05:57:48.914
THE AVERAGE TIME I LOOK THIS

05:57:48.980 --> 05:57:51.049
UP THIS IS A FOR A FACT THE

05:57:51.116 --> 05:57:54.386
AVERAGE TIME BETWEEN DIAGNOSIS

05:57:54.920 --> 05:57:56.154
AND GETTING AN ORTHOPEDIC

05:57:56.221 --> 05:57:58.056
SURGERY BACK SURGERY KNEE

05:57:58.123 --> 05:57:59.591
REPLACEMENT HIP REPLACEMENT

05:57:59.658 --> 05:58:02.260
ETCETERA IT'S FORTY EIGHT WEEKS

05:58:03.195 --> 05:58:04.930
THAT'S QUITE A WHILE I MEAN

05:58:04.996 --> 05:58:06.331
THEY RATION CARE IN CANADA

05:58:06.398 --> 05:58:07.966
THAT'S WELL DOCUMENTED AND I

05:58:08.033 --> 05:58:09.234
THINK HEALTHCARE MIGHT LEAD TO

05:58:09.301 --> 05:58:11.303
A SITUATION WHERE CALIFORNIA

05:58:11.369 --> 05:58:12.470
IS DOING SIMILAR THINGS TO

05:58:12.537 --> 05:58:15.774
CONTAIN COSTS AND THAT STRIKES

05:58:15.841 --> 05:58:18.310
ME AS A TOUGH SELL TO ALL OF

05:58:18.376 --> 05:58:20.378
THE MEDICAL SCHOOL GRADUATES

05:58:20.679 --> 05:58:22.814
NURSES AND PEAS ALL THE MEDICAL

05:58:22.881 --> 05:58:24.649
PROFESSIONALS THAT WE NEED TO

05:58:24.716 --> 05:58:26.518
BRING INTO OUR STATE SO THAT WE

05:58:26.585 --> 05:58:27.919
HAVE ENOUGH SERVICE PROVIDERS

05:58:27.986 --> 05:58:30.488
HERE TO SERVE OUR POPULATION

05:58:30.555 --> 05:58:31.590
SO HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THAT

05:58:31.656 --> 05:58:32.824
CONCERN WAS A LOT OF LESSONS

05:58:32.891 --> 05:58:33.959
WE CAN CERTAINLY LEARN AS I

05:58:34.025 --> 05:58:35.327
SAID I'M MY INTEREST IS NOT

05:58:35.393 --> 05:58:36.461
TO CREATE A SYSTEM LIKE AND

05:58:36.528 --> 05:58:38.563
LIKE LIKE ANY OTHER I DO HAVE

05:58:38.630 --> 05:58:40.031
A CHANCE IN OCTOBER TO VISIT

05:58:40.098 --> 05:58:41.666
ONTARIO AND QUEBEC AND AND MET

05:58:41.733 --> 05:58:43.235
WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM BOTH

05:58:43.301 --> 05:58:44.469
THEIR HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS I ALSO

05:58:44.536 --> 05:58:46.171
WENT TO RULE COMMUNITY ACTUALLY

05:58:46.238 --> 05:58:47.305
LIVED IN BACK IN THE SEVENTIES

05:58:47.372 --> 05:58:48.974
WITH FORTY TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE

05:58:49.040 --> 05:58:50.442
TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW THEY

05:58:50.508 --> 05:58:52.143
OBSERVE RURAL COMMUNITIES IN

05:58:52.210 --> 05:58:53.178
CANADA WHICH OBVIOUSLY HAS A

05:58:53.245 --> 05:58:55.146
LOT OF RURAL COMMUNITIES OF

05:58:55.213 --> 05:58:56.781
THE NORTH OF THE -- OF THE

05:58:56.848 --> 05:58:58.984
POPULATION BASE -- AND LOOK I

05:58:59.050 --> 05:59:00.085
AGREE THAT WORKFORCE SHORTAGE

05:59:00.151 --> 05:59:01.052
IS A PROBLEM WITH TODAY'S

05:59:01.119 --> 05:59:03.722
SYSTEM -- AND AN EIGHTY FOUR

05:59:03.788 --> 05:59:05.523
HUNDRED DESIGNED TO REMOVE

05:59:05.590 --> 05:59:06.691
SOME OF THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES

05:59:06.758 --> 05:59:08.593
AND REALLOCATE RESOURCES TO

05:59:08.660 --> 05:59:11.129
AREAS WITH WITH THE MOST NEED

05:59:11.196 --> 05:59:12.764
-- OR IMPROVED EFFICIENCIES

05:59:12.831 --> 05:59:15.934
AND SO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WE PAY

05:59:16.001 --> 05:59:17.202
A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL CAN

05:59:17.269 --> 05:59:19.070
INFLUENCE THE REPLACE SHORTAGE

05:59:19.137 --> 05:59:20.772
FOR EXAMPLE WE TEND TO PAY MORE

05:59:20.839 --> 05:59:22.140
TO SPECIALIST AND PRIMARY CARE

05:59:22.207 --> 05:59:24.042
DOCTORS AND WE SEE SHORTAGES IN

05:59:24.109 --> 05:59:25.243
PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS THROUGHOUT

05:59:25.310 --> 05:59:27.612
THE STATE ESPECIALLY IN RURAL

05:59:27.679 --> 05:59:29.581
-- AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES

05:59:29.648 --> 05:59:31.016
-- BUT THAT IS UNDER OUR

05:59:31.082 --> 05:59:32.951
CURRENT SYSTEM WE SEE IN OTHERS

05:59:33.018 --> 05:59:34.085
BUDGET CUTBACKS CORPORATE

05:59:34.152 --> 05:59:35.787
GREED A LACK OF SUPPORT STAFF

05:59:35.854 --> 05:59:38.156
BURNOUT THE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

05:59:38.223 --> 05:59:40.292
NURSING SHORTAGE AND ATTEMPT TO

05:59:40.358 --> 05:59:42.460

06:05:24.836 --> 06:05:26.437
DIRECT RESULT OF THE FOR PROFIT

06:05:26.504 --> 06:05:27.905

WORKS HARD TO MAINTAIN ONE

06:05:34.312 --> 06:05:35.680
IN FOUR AMERICANS LIVE WITH A

06:05:35.747 --> 06:05:38.216
DISABILITY AND ONLY A SINGLE

06:05:38.283 --> 06:05:39.584

AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES

06:05:56.000 --> 06:05:57.201
AND BECAUSE STATES MANAGE

WITH HOME CARE PROVIDERS AND

06:07:48.413 --> 06:07:49.947

06:12:44.442 --> 06:12:46.043
OUR FIRST STEPS WE SHOULD BE

06:12:46.110 --> 06:12:47.812

06:14:04.955 --> 06:14:06.290
THE STATE BUREAUCRACY THAT

06:17:03.767 --> 06:17:05.336
REQUIRE A CHANGE IN FEDERAL

06:17:05.402 --> 06:17:07.771
REGULATORY LAW AND WOULD LIKELY

06:17:07.838 --> 06:17:09.273
REQUIRE CHANGES TO THE STATE

06:20:45.689 --> 06:20:47.057
ASK HIM ABOUT HE HAD TOUCHED

06:20:47.124 --> 06:20:50.027
ON OF ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH

06:20:50.093 --> 06:20:52.329
THE BOARD THAT WOULD BE SET

06:20:52.396 --> 06:20:55.432
UP THAT THIS THIS BOARD WOULD

06:20:55.499 --> 06:20:58.168
BE -- PROVIDING BUDGETS FOR

06:20:58.235 --> 06:21:01.138
HOSPITALS AND OTHERS AT ACTING

06:21:01.205 --> 06:21:04.107
AS RATE SETTING BECAUSE THE

06:21:04.174 --> 06:21:05.309
BOARD WILL NOW DECIDE WHAT

06:21:05.375 --> 06:21:07.110
OPERATING COSTS WILL BE INSTEAD

06:21:07.177 --> 06:21:09.213
OF WHAT THEY ACTUALLY ARE

06:21:09.279 --> 06:21:10.080
AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU

06:21:10.147 --> 06:21:12.382
COULD COME ALIVE RATE YOU KNOW

06:21:12.449 --> 06:21:14.818
WILLIS BOARD LOOK AT PROVIDER

06:21:14.885 --> 06:21:16.153
RATES WILL THEY BE SENDING

06:21:16.220 --> 06:21:19.489
HOSPITAL RATES -- WILL IMPROVE

06:21:19.556 --> 06:21:22.492
PRICE CEILINGS -- YEAH HOW

06:21:22.559 --> 06:21:25.062
DO YOU FORESEE THIS WORKING

06:21:31.868 --> 06:21:34.938
THERE ANY -- JOB

06:21:35.005 --> 06:21:37.441
CREATORS HOWEVER --

06:21:40.310 --> 06:21:41.178
IF YOU COULD JUST REPEAT A

06:21:41.245 --> 06:21:42.212
LITTLE BIT OF A QUOTE REAL

06:21:42.279 --> 06:21:44.514
QUICK SERVICE COMING UP SORRY

06:21:44.581 --> 06:21:46.216
THIS WASN'T SUING SO THE BOARD

06:21:46.283 --> 06:21:47.918
ON THAT THAT WILL BE SET UP

06:21:47.985 --> 06:21:50.020
-- WOULD PROVIDE BUDGETS FOR

06:21:50.087 --> 06:21:51.888
HOSPITALS AND OTHERS IS AXES

06:21:51.955 --> 06:21:53.523
RIGHT GREAT SITTING BASICALLY

06:21:53.590 --> 06:21:54.891
BECAUSE THE BOARD WILL NOW HAVE

06:21:54.958 --> 06:21:56.526
TO DECIDE WHAT THE OPERATING

06:21:56.593 --> 06:21:58.762
COSTS WOULD BE INSTEAD OF

06:21:58.829 --> 06:22:00.797
WHAT THE REALITY IS WHAT'S THE

06:22:00.864 --> 06:22:03.734
ACTUAL COST VERSUS WHAT THEY

06:22:03.800 --> 06:22:06.870
WOULD SAID WILL LEAD TO JUSTIN

06:22:06.937 --> 06:22:09.840
PROVIDER RATES HOSPITAL RATES

06:22:10.140 --> 06:22:11.608
ACCEPTABLE WITH THE PRICING

06:22:11.675 --> 06:22:14.444
ON YEAH IT'S AN INTERESTING

06:22:14.511 --> 06:22:15.545
QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND

06:22:15.612 --> 06:22:17.114
I CAN TELL YOU RATE SETTING IS

06:22:17.180 --> 06:22:19.182
SOMETHING THAT IS DISCONCERTING

06:22:19.249 --> 06:22:21.451
-- OUR OPINION HAS CONSISTENTLY

06:22:21.518 --> 06:22:22.786
BEEN THAT THE FREE MARKET

06:22:22.853 --> 06:22:24.488
SHOULD SET WHAT THE RATES ARE

06:22:24.554 --> 06:22:26.156
BECAUSE THAT BECOMES PATIENT

06:22:26.223 --> 06:22:29.192
CENTRIC IN SO IF YOU DO HAVE

06:22:29.259 --> 06:22:30.193
A PATIENT AT THE POINT OF

06:22:30.260 --> 06:22:32.229
CARE WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO

06:22:32.296 --> 06:22:33.430
MISTER OR DOCTOR WHICH POINT

06:22:33.497 --> 06:22:36.133
EARLIER ABOUT -- TRANSPARENCY

06:22:36.199 --> 06:22:38.135
IN PRICING IN PATIENTS KNOWING

06:22:38.201 --> 06:22:40.070
WHAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO

06:22:40.137 --> 06:22:41.104
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING

06:22:41.171 --> 06:22:42.572
RATE SETTINGS NOT NECESSARILY

06:22:42.639 --> 06:22:44.541
THE ANSWER THOUGH AND THE

06:22:44.608 --> 06:22:47.711
REASON WHY IS IT IT BIFURCATES

06:22:48.111 --> 06:22:51.281
-- PAYMENT SOURCES IT --

06:22:51.348 --> 06:22:53.216
DOESN'T NECESSARILY REIMBURSE

06:22:53.283 --> 06:22:54.751
FOR WORK THAT IS DONE AND I

06:22:54.818 --> 06:22:56.320
THINK IMPORTANTLY IF DOESN'T

06:22:56.386 --> 06:22:58.288
REIMBURSE FOR QUALITY CARE AS

06:22:58.355 --> 06:23:00.724
OPPOSED TO -- MAYBE QUANTITY

06:23:00.791 --> 06:23:02.726
OF CARE OR VOLUME OF CARE

06:23:02.793 --> 06:23:05.228
-- I I THINK AND THEN I'LL

06:23:05.295 --> 06:23:08.131
BE GOING TO REQUEST OKAY

06:23:11.401 --> 06:23:14.371
-- THANK YOU AND THEN MY SECOND

06:23:14.438 --> 06:23:16.740
QUESTION IS ABOUT THE FACT

06:23:16.807 --> 06:23:18.041
THAT WE ALL AGREE THE STATUS

06:23:18.108 --> 06:23:20.277
QUO IS NOT WORKING AND AND

06:23:20.344 --> 06:23:21.812
THIS WOULD BE FOR THE AUTHOR

06:23:21.878 --> 06:23:25.782
OR HIS SUPPORTER -- MEDICO

06:23:25.849 --> 06:23:27.851
SYSTEM IS BROKEN THERE'S TOO

06:23:27.918 --> 06:23:30.287
MUCH BUREAUCRACY WE DON'T

06:23:30.354 --> 06:23:31.521
HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS WE CAN

06:23:31.588 --> 06:23:33.090
ALL AGREE THERE'S A WORKFORCE

06:23:33.156 --> 06:23:35.525
SHORTAGE OF PROVIDERS MEDICO

06:23:36.326 --> 06:23:37.994
ACCESS TO CARE IS GROWING AND

06:23:38.061 --> 06:23:40.397
IS AN EVER PRESENT PROBLEM

06:23:40.464 --> 06:23:43.233
WHY NOT WORK ON STREAMLINING

06:23:43.300 --> 06:23:46.370
IMPROVING AND FIXING MEDICO SO

06:23:46.436 --> 06:23:48.038
THAT MORE PEOPLE CAN ACCESS IT

06:23:48.105 --> 06:23:49.840
RATHER THAN KIND OF SCRAPPING

06:23:49.906 --> 06:23:52.409
THE WHOLE SYSTEM STARTING OVER

06:23:53.777 --> 06:23:55.045
A BIG ISSUE WITH MEDI CAL AS

06:23:55.112 --> 06:23:56.313
THE FACULTY MEMBERS OF RATES

06:23:56.380 --> 06:23:57.748
ARE TOO LOW AND YOU DON'T HAVE

06:23:57.814 --> 06:23:58.915
ENOUGH PROVIDERS ARE GOING TO

06:23:58.982 --> 06:24:00.083
TAKE THEM ESPECIALLY IN RURAL

06:24:00.150 --> 06:24:01.651
AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

06:24:02.252 --> 06:24:04.654
AND SO WE CAN AND I'VE ALWAYS

06:24:04.721 --> 06:24:06.089
SUPPORTED EVERY EFFORT WHENEVER

06:24:06.156 --> 06:24:07.157
YOU TRY TO INCREASE MEDICAL

06:24:07.224 --> 06:24:08.125
REIMBURSEMENT REYES BECAUSE

06:24:08.191 --> 06:24:09.626
AGAIN WITHIN THE CURRENT SYSTEM

06:24:09.693 --> 06:24:11.294
WE HAVE THAT'S THE BEST WAY

06:24:11.361 --> 06:24:14.097
OF RECREATING IN ACCESS BUT

06:24:14.164 --> 06:24:16.533
THEN THE DAY IS NOT ENOUGH --

06:24:16.600 --> 06:24:21.004
AND THE END BECAUSE MEDI CAL

06:24:21.071 --> 06:24:23.206
IS ULTIMATELY COMPETING WITH

06:24:23.273 --> 06:24:25.041
THE PRIVATE PAY SYSTEM THAT

06:24:25.108 --> 06:24:26.076
IS NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO

06:24:26.143 --> 06:24:28.145
CATCH CATCH UP AND SO RATHER

06:24:28.211 --> 06:24:30.147
THAN HAVING A MAN HAVING A

06:24:30.213 --> 06:24:31.481
CASTE SYSTEM WITHIN OUR HEALTH

06:24:31.548 --> 06:24:34.184
CARE SYSTEM WE HAVE FOLKS THAT

06:24:34.251 --> 06:24:35.752
ARE ON MEDICARE L.

06:24:35.819 --> 06:24:38.555
OR A CA BRONZE LEVEL GAME COVER

06:24:38.622 --> 06:24:40.657
CALIFORNIA BRONZE LEVEL OR

06:24:40.857 --> 06:24:42.159
SOME KIND OF LIKE PACKAGE OF

06:24:42.225 --> 06:24:43.894
HEALTH CARE INSTEAD YOU HAVE

06:24:43.960 --> 06:24:44.828
THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY

06:24:44.895 --> 06:24:46.363
INCREASE REIMBURSEMENT RATES

06:24:46.430 --> 06:24:48.098
IF YOU HAVE EVERYONE IN ONE

06:24:48.165 --> 06:24:50.233
SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM AND THEN

06:24:50.300 --> 06:24:52.202
YOU CAN ACTUALLY NEGOTIATE

06:24:52.269 --> 06:24:53.036
ON BEHALF OF FORTY MILLION

06:24:53.103 --> 06:24:54.604
CALIFORNIANS OF PHARMACEUTICALS

06:24:54.971 --> 06:24:56.673
ON HEALTHCARE DELIVERY --

06:24:56.740 --> 06:24:58.542
AND YOU'RE ABLE TO THEN PAY

06:24:58.608 --> 06:25:00.310
PROVIDERS MORE ESPECIALLY

06:25:00.510 --> 06:25:02.345
PEDIATRICIANS FAMILY DOCTORS

06:25:02.679 --> 06:25:05.348
-- YOU KNOW OBGYN DOCTORS THAT

06:25:05.415 --> 06:25:06.716
ARE NOT GETTING COMPENSATED

06:25:06.783 --> 06:25:08.518
FRANKLY ENOUGH FOR THE CRITICAL

06:25:08.585 --> 06:25:09.953
SERVICES PARTICULARLY INSURANCE

06:25:10.020 --> 06:25:11.555
PREVENTATIVE CARE OTHER THEY

06:25:11.621 --> 06:25:13.690
PROVIDE AND THAT'S WHY IN SO

06:25:13.757 --> 06:25:14.691
MANY RURAL COMMUNITIES AND

06:25:14.758 --> 06:25:16.092
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IT'S

06:25:16.159 --> 06:25:17.561
HARD TO FIND DOCTORS THAT WILL

06:25:17.627 --> 06:25:19.129
TAKE A MINUTE CAL AND THAT'S

06:25:19.196 --> 06:25:21.331
UNDERSTANDABLE BECAUSE WE'RE

06:25:21.398 --> 06:25:22.499
NOT PAYING THEM ENOUGH AND SO

06:25:22.566 --> 06:25:25.168
INSTEAD OF HAVING A OF OF A

06:25:25.235 --> 06:25:28.805
SECONDARY LEVEL OF OF CARE --

06:25:28.872 --> 06:25:29.773
AND AGAIN WHEN I SAY THAT I

06:25:29.840 --> 06:25:30.740
DON'T NEED THE DOCTORS GETTING

06:25:30.807 --> 06:25:32.275
A SECONDARY LEVEL CARE I MEAN

06:25:32.342 --> 06:25:33.243
THAT THERE'S ONLY JUST SO SO

06:25:33.310 --> 06:25:34.711
MANY PATIENTS THAT SOME OF THE

06:25:34.778 --> 06:25:35.912
TAKES MEDICAL CONTENT G.

06:25:35.979 --> 06:25:36.480
C.

06:25:36.947 --> 06:25:37.848
AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T

06:25:37.914 --> 06:25:40.817
HAVE NO DOCTORS TAKING -- EDIT

06:25:40.884 --> 06:25:42.752
CAL PATIENTS ON TOP OF THAT

06:25:42.819 --> 06:25:43.653
YOU HAVE MORE PEOPLE GOING

06:25:43.720 --> 06:25:45.088
TO SPECIALTIES AND COMING

06:25:45.155 --> 06:25:46.022
SPECIALIST BECAUSE THEY CAN

06:25:46.089 --> 06:25:47.557
MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY

06:25:47.624 --> 06:25:48.792
WE HAVE LESS OF A HEALTH

06:25:48.859 --> 06:25:50.260
CARE SYSTEM WE HAVE MORE OF

06:25:50.327 --> 06:25:51.962
THE DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND

06:25:52.028 --> 06:25:53.597
CATASTROPHIC RESPONSE SYSTEM

06:25:54.097 --> 06:25:56.933
WHERE WE GET WHERE FOLKS ARE

06:25:57.000 --> 06:25:58.969
KIND OF DESTROYING ALONG BUT

06:25:59.035 --> 06:26:00.971
THE BUT THE THE -- ALL LEVEL

06:26:01.037 --> 06:26:02.839
OF CARE WHERE YOU HAVE DOCTORS

06:26:02.906 --> 06:26:03.640
THAT USED TO BE ABLE TO SIT

06:26:03.707 --> 06:26:04.407
DOWN WITH YOU FOR TWENTY

06:26:04.474 --> 06:26:05.542
MINUTES NOW LOOKING AS IF

06:26:05.609 --> 06:26:06.810
YOU WERE TWO MINUTES BECAUSE

06:26:06.877 --> 06:26:07.544
THEY'RE DEALING WITH ALL THE

06:26:07.611 --> 06:26:09.312
BUREAUCRACY AND PAPERWORK

06:26:09.513 --> 06:26:11.181
OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND

06:26:11.248 --> 06:26:12.682
THEN ULTIMATELY SOMETHING

06:26:12.749 --> 06:26:14.084
CATASTROPHIC HAPPENS AND THE

06:26:14.150 --> 06:26:15.752
SPECIALIST COMES AND MAKES A

06:26:15.819 --> 06:26:17.687
BOATLOAD OF MONEY AND PATCHES

06:26:17.754 --> 06:26:19.089
YOU UP SEND YOU BACK OUT

06:26:19.155 --> 06:26:19.956
WITHOUT EVER DEALING WITH THE

06:26:20.023 --> 06:26:21.558
UNDERLYING ISSUES WE NEED A

06:26:21.625 --> 06:26:22.659
FOOT THAT IN OUR HEALTH CARE

06:26:22.726 --> 06:26:25.262
SYSTEM AND THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM

06:26:25.328 --> 06:26:27.030
HAS THE ABILITY TO DO THAT BY

06:26:27.097 --> 06:26:28.331
FOCUSING WHERE THE RESOURCES

06:26:28.398 --> 06:26:30.600
NEED TO GO IN A WAY THAT THEY

06:26:30.667 --> 06:26:32.569
CAN FOCUS ON HEALTH OUTCOMES

06:26:32.636 --> 06:26:34.337
NOT JUST WHETHER OF BILLS PAID

06:26:34.404 --> 06:26:36.773
OR NOT SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT

06:26:36.840 --> 06:26:38.542
PROVIDERS WOULD BE PAID MORE

06:26:38.608 --> 06:26:40.477
UNDER THIS NEW SYSTEM YEAH

06:26:40.544 --> 06:26:41.811
THIS IS NOT ABOUT PAYING PEOPLE

06:26:41.878 --> 06:26:43.880
BETTER CALORIES ABSOLUTELY NOT

06:26:45.682 --> 06:26:47.450
OKAY SO SPECIALIST WILL STILL

06:26:47.517 --> 06:26:48.885
BE PAID MORE TO RECURSOS

06:26:48.952 --> 06:26:51.488
RIGID PROCEDURES WOULD BE ALL

06:26:51.721 --> 06:26:53.290
INDIVIDUAL OVER THE PROVIDERS

06:26:53.356 --> 06:26:54.958
WILL BE PAID IT YOU KNOW

06:26:55.025 --> 06:26:55.992
ACCORDING TO THE SERVICE THAT

06:26:56.059 --> 06:26:57.093
THEY'RE PROVIDING WITHOUT

06:26:57.160 --> 06:26:58.862
HAVING FOR EXAMPLE SITUATIONS

06:26:58.929 --> 06:27:00.830
NOW WE'RE IN THE SAME HOSPITAL

06:27:00.897 --> 06:27:02.532
FOR THE SAME PROCEDURE YOU CAN

06:27:02.599 --> 06:27:04.834
HAVE A VARIANCE IN OF OF TEN X.

06:27:04.901 --> 06:27:06.336
TEN TIMES FOR SOME OF MY

06:27:06.403 --> 06:27:07.470
GET CHARGE SIX HUNDRED SIX

06:27:07.537 --> 06:27:08.338
HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS

06:27:08.405 --> 06:27:09.706
OR SOMETHING SOMEONE ELSE THE

06:27:09.773 --> 06:27:11.408
SAME HOSPITAL BE CHARGED SIX

06:27:11.474 --> 06:27:13.710
OR SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND

06:27:13.777 --> 06:27:15.879
IT'S JUST A NONSENSICAL WAY

06:27:15.946 --> 06:27:17.747
OF HAVING HEALTHCARE DELIVERY

06:27:17.814 --> 06:27:20.984
OF IT IN OUR STATE AND SO WE

06:27:21.051 --> 06:27:22.285
HAVE THE ABILITY TO RIGHT SIZE

06:27:22.352 --> 06:27:24.421
IT TOOK UNTIL AT LEAST HAVE

06:27:24.487 --> 06:27:25.722
SOME SENSE OF ORDER WHERE THE

06:27:25.789 --> 06:27:26.923
RESOURCES ARE ACTUALLY GOING

06:27:26.990 --> 06:27:28.358
TO THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS

06:27:28.425 --> 06:27:29.459
YOU'RE NOT HAVING MASSIVE

06:27:29.526 --> 06:27:31.595
PROFITS TAKEN OFF THE TOP OF

06:27:31.661 --> 06:27:33.330
THAT CREATE ANY ANY ANY CALL

06:27:33.396 --> 06:27:35.865
SYSTEM AND ALSO INCENTIVIZE

06:27:35.932 --> 06:27:38.602
SPECIALIST OVER -- YOUR FAMILY

06:27:38.668 --> 06:27:40.937
PRACTITIONERS AS WELL SO I

06:27:41.004 --> 06:27:42.372
THINK WE COULD GO A LONG WAY

06:27:42.439 --> 06:27:44.574
AND SAVE MONEY TOO WE WOULD

06:27:44.641 --> 06:27:46.242
FINALLY AS THIS LEGISLATURE

GO WRONG SO YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN

06:29:10.093 --> 06:29:11.661
ASKED TO FOCUS ON THE POLICY

THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN HISTORY

06:29:27.777 --> 06:29:29.112
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SEPARATE THE

06:29:29.179 --> 06:29:30.980
POSITIVE CONCEPT OF GOVERNMENT

06:35:24.500 --> 06:35:26.202
IN HIS LOWER LEG WENT TO THE

06:35:26.269 --> 06:35:28.838
EMERGENCY ROOM THEY SAW HIM

06:35:28.905 --> 06:35:30.773
THEY SENT HIM HOME AND THAT

06:35:30.840 --> 06:35:32.275
HE NEVER GOT WE HAVE NEVER

06:35:32.341 --> 06:35:34.243
GOT REALLY ANY CARE TO SPEAK

06:35:34.310 --> 06:35:37.313
OF AND HE'S BEDRIDDEN WHEN HE

06:35:37.380 --> 06:35:38.815
WAS ON THE GOLF COURSE BEFORE

06:35:38.881 --> 06:35:41.818
THIS INCIDENT SO I AM NO ONE

06:35:41.884 --> 06:35:43.219
WANTS THAT NO ONE SUPPORTS

06:35:43.286 --> 06:35:45.354
THE STATUS QUO YOU KNOW NINETY

06:35:45.421 --> 06:35:46.956
THREE PERCENT OF PEOPLE ARE

06:35:47.023 --> 06:35:48.691
COVERED NOW THE COVERAGE

06:35:48.758 --> 06:35:51.828
DOESN'T EQUAL CARE WE CAN FOCUS

06:35:51.894 --> 06:35:54.664
ON THOSE THINGS -- AND I HAVE

06:35:54.730 --> 06:35:56.699
A WHOLE LIST OF IDEAS SO I'M

06:35:56.766 --> 06:35:58.101
NOT JUST VOTING NO I ACTUALLY

06:35:58.167 --> 06:35:59.902
DO HAVE IDEAS AND ALWAYS TALK

06:35:59.969 --> 06:36:02.171
ABOUT THEM ABOUT STREAMLINING

06:36:02.238 --> 06:36:03.573
THE BURDENSOME SYSTEM THAT

06:36:03.639 --> 06:36:05.708
WE HAVE NOW INCREASED AND

06:36:05.775 --> 06:36:07.543
MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT RATES

06:36:07.610 --> 06:36:09.612
TO INCENTIVIZE MORE PROVIDERS

06:36:10.246 --> 06:36:11.681
WE NEED ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE

06:36:11.747 --> 06:36:13.583
SYSTEM WE NEEDED OUTCOME BASED

06:36:13.649 --> 06:36:15.151
WE NEED VALID VALUE BASED

06:36:15.218 --> 06:36:16.853
CARE WE NEED TO BRING MORE

06:36:16.919 --> 06:36:18.921
TECHNOLOGY THAT ACTUALLY WORKS

06:36:19.155 --> 06:36:20.556
INTO THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SO

06:36:20.623 --> 06:36:21.824
WE HAVE MORE DATA AND MAKE IT

06:36:21.891 --> 06:36:23.126
MORE PERSONALIZED MAKES MORE

06:36:23.192 --> 06:36:25.695
STREAMLINED WE NEED TO ALLOW

06:36:25.761 --> 06:36:27.630
TO BURKE TO ANALYZE FIVE TO

06:36:27.697 --> 06:36:29.365
TEN YEARS OR TWENTY YEARS OR

06:36:29.432 --> 06:36:31.868
LIFETIME WHICH IS WHAT PRIVATE

06:36:31.934 --> 06:36:34.003
PLANS DO BECAUSE I MET WITH THE

06:36:34.070 --> 06:36:36.139
TO BERMAN ELSE THIS ANALYSTS

06:36:36.205 --> 06:36:37.573
AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY

06:36:37.640 --> 06:36:40.076
DO AND HOW THEY DO IT WE CAN

06:36:40.143 --> 06:36:42.111
GET A BETTER IDEA COULD WORK

06:36:42.178 --> 06:36:44.680
ON KEEPING OUR COSTS LOWER IF

06:36:44.747 --> 06:36:45.848
WE ARE MORE EFFICIENT AND IT

06:36:45.915 --> 06:36:47.283
WE NEED MORE PRETENCE PARENTS

06:36:47.350 --> 06:36:49.018
SEEING ANOTHER DOCTOR WOULD

06:36:49.085 --> 06:36:51.087
SAID ONE OF THE TO COST GOING

06:36:51.154 --> 06:36:54.090
IN THE BUREAUCRACY IS TOO BIG

06:36:54.157 --> 06:36:55.358
STARTING WITH THE CALIFORNIA

06:36:55.424 --> 06:36:56.492
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

06:36:56.559 --> 06:36:58.661

YOU'RE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING

06:37:02.131 --> 06:37:04.634
SO YOU KNOW NO ONE SUPPORTS

06:37:04.700 --> 06:37:07.069
THE STATUS QUO WE CAN DO SOME

06:37:07.136 --> 06:37:10.006
THINGS AND I COULD GO ON AND

06:37:10.072 --> 06:37:11.841

I APOLOGIZE IF YOU HAVEN'T

06:37:42.872 --> 06:37:45.608
THE STATE'S NEW FREEDOM --

06:37:47.944 --> 06:37:49.745
I HAD MY FIRST MISCARRIAGE

06:37:49.812 --> 06:37:52.848
WHEN I WAS SIX MONTHS PREGNANT

06:37:52.915 --> 06:37:54.784
AND I ONLY BRING THAT UP

06:37:54.850 --> 06:37:56.719

06:38:23.913 --> 06:38:26.382
COVERAGE IS VITAL AND AFTER

06:38:26.449 --> 06:38:27.650
LISTENING TODAY I DON'T THINK

06:38:27.717 --> 06:38:28.918
THAT THERE'S ANYONE IN THIS

06:38:28.985 --> 06:38:30.253

MORALLY DEMAND OF OURSELVES SO

06:38:47.003 --> 06:38:48.604
I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS I WILL

06:38:48.671 --> 06:38:49.939

OFF LIKE OTHERS I HAVE CROSSED

06:38:51.240 --> 06:38:52.675
ON SOME OF MY QUESTIONS THAT

06:38:52.742 --> 06:38:55.111
I AM HAVE BEEN ANSWERED I JUST

06:38:55.177 --> 06:38:56.312

CALIFORNIANS THAT AB FOURTEEN

06:39:03.319 --> 06:39:04.353
HUNDRED SEEKS TO ADDRESS IS

06:39:04.420 --> 06:39:06.188
ROUGHLY THREE POINT TWO MILLION

06:39:06.255 --> 06:39:07.189
AND THE GOVERNOR'S RECENT

06:39:07.256 --> 06:39:08.824
BUDGET PROPOSAL ANNOUNCED

06:39:08.891 --> 06:39:10.192
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE COVERAGE

06:39:10.259 --> 06:39:11.460
FOR ALL STATE RESIDENTS

06:39:11.527 --> 06:39:13.195
REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION

06:39:13.262 --> 06:39:16.198
STATUS BETWEEN THAT AND THE

06:39:16.265 --> 06:39:17.533
CHAIR'S OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE

06:39:17.600 --> 06:39:18.701
FOR THE OF WHICH I HAVE BEEN

06:39:18.768 --> 06:39:21.470
A CO AUTHOR IT SEEMS LIKE JUST

06:39:21.537 --> 06:39:23.105
THIS WEEK CALIFORNIA HAS MADE

06:39:23.172 --> 06:39:25.141
GREAT STRIDES TO ACHIEVE YOUR

06:39:25.207 --> 06:39:27.243
STATED GOALS BUT THE AND THOSE

06:39:27.310 --> 06:39:30.413
ARE NOW GOALS AS OPPOSED TO

06:39:30.479 --> 06:39:32.214
SOME HOPE AND UNDERDEVELOPED

06:39:32.281 --> 06:39:35.084
COSTS SO THAT RIGHT NOW

06:39:35.151 --> 06:39:36.419
UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO HEALTH

06:39:36.485 --> 06:39:37.586
CARE AND COST CONTAINMENT

06:39:37.653 --> 06:39:39.655
WITHOUT RAISING TAXES IS ON THE

06:39:39.722 --> 06:39:43.893
TABLE IS THAT CORRECT BOTH OF

06:39:44.960 --> 06:39:47.863
DECEMBER THIS IS LIKE I SAID

06:39:47.930 --> 06:39:49.031
EARLIER IN MY COMMENTS I DO

06:39:49.098 --> 06:39:51.334
SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

06:39:51.400 --> 06:39:52.668
AND AND THE WORK OF DR ROBERT

06:39:52.735 --> 06:39:54.470
AND SO MANY OTHERS HERE THE

06:39:54.537 --> 06:39:56.305
IN EXPANDING ACCESS BUT ACCESS

06:39:56.372 --> 06:39:57.306
TO HEALTH CARE IS NOT THE SAME

06:39:57.373 --> 06:39:58.974
AS UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE AND

06:39:59.041 --> 06:40:00.109
THAT'S THE DISTINCTION IS THAT

06:40:00.176 --> 06:40:02.611
MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE INSURANCE

06:40:02.678 --> 06:40:03.879
-- BECAUSE OF VERY HIGH

06:40:03.946 --> 06:40:05.147
DEDUCTIBLES OF BECAUSE OTHER

06:40:05.214 --> 06:40:08.551
COSTS -- THEY ARE THE RATIONAL

06:40:08.617 --> 06:40:09.919
CARE I DON'T HAVE TO ACCESS

06:40:09.985 --> 06:40:11.554
OR GO BANKRUPT EVEN WHILE THEY

06:40:11.620 --> 06:40:14.357
HAVE INSURANCE -- AND SO THIS

06:40:14.423 --> 06:40:16.525
IS ABOUT ACTUALLY CREATE BRING

06:40:16.592 --> 06:40:17.827
COMPREHENSIVE CARE TO EVERY

06:40:17.893 --> 06:40:20.863
CALIFORNIANS -- SO DOES THIS

06:40:20.930 --> 06:40:23.199
OF THEIR WEALTH REGARDLESS OF

06:40:23.265 --> 06:40:26.235
WHERE THEY LIVE -- AND THAT'S

06:40:26.302 --> 06:40:27.803
SOMETHING THAT WE FALL SHORT OF

06:40:27.870 --> 06:40:29.138
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU'RE

06:40:29.205 --> 06:40:30.606
PROPOSALS ON THE TABLE IN THE

06:40:30.673 --> 06:40:32.208
GOVERNOR'S NOW I'M SUGGESTING

06:40:32.274 --> 06:40:34.143
THAT NOW ACCESS AND UNIVERSAL

06:40:34.210 --> 06:40:36.379
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IS ON THE

06:40:36.445 --> 06:40:39.515
TABLE RIGHT NOW AND WITHOUT ANY

06:40:39.582 --> 06:40:40.850
SORT OF TAX INCREASES IS THAT

06:40:40.916 --> 06:40:45.054
CORRECT MMHM RIGHT AND IN GREAT

06:40:45.121 --> 06:40:47.289
AND WILL BE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

06:40:47.356 --> 06:40:48.324
WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS

06:40:48.391 --> 06:40:49.392
WITHIN A COUPLE YEARS I THINK

TO COVER CALIFORNIA THEY'RE

06:40:58.968 --> 06:41:01.670
ELIGIBLE THEN ALSO FOR MY

06:41:01.737 --> 06:41:04.740

WOULD BE A COST CONTAINMENT

06:45:15.658 --> 06:45:17.326
MEASURE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE

06:45:17.393 --> 06:45:19.194
ENSURING THAT THE PAYMENTS THAT

06:45:19.261 --> 06:45:21.664
ARE PAID TOWARD HOSPITALS ARE

06:45:21.730 --> 06:45:23.766
CLOSER TO ACT THE ACTUAL COST

06:45:23.832 --> 06:45:26.935
OF CARE RATHER THAN -- RATHER

06:45:27.002 --> 06:45:29.471
THAN -- DOLLARS GOING TO TO

-- -- HOSPITAL PROFITING AND

06:45:33.142 --> 06:45:34.510
ON TOP OF THAT THERE WOULD BE

06:45:34.576 --> 06:45:37.046
A BETTER DISTRIBUTION OF THE

THE COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES

06:45:45.387 --> 06:45:48.023
CALM BECAUSE WE SIMPLY SIMPLE

06:45:48.090 --> 06:45:50.592
FLYING -- THAT THE SYSTEM

06:45:50.659 --> 06:45:52.161
ITSELF WE BEACH SIMPLIFYING

06:45:52.227 --> 06:45:53.429
THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE

FOR YOU FOR YOU ALL -- THAT WAS

06:46:03.272 --> 06:46:05.507
PRESENTED TO US -- YOU KNOW --

06:46:05.574 --> 06:46:08.744
ENTITIES -- WILL SPEND ABOUT

06:46:08.811 --> 06:46:10.379
EIGHTY FIVE BILLION SERVICES

06:46:10.446 --> 06:46:12.014
HOSPITALS PHYSICIANS AND OTHER

06:46:12.081 --> 06:46:13.449
HEALTH CARE FACILITIES WILL

06:46:13.515 --> 06:46:15.184
SPEND ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE BILLION

06:46:15.250 --> 06:46:16.852
OR LESS IN ADMINISTRATIVE

06:46:16.919 --> 06:46:19.655
COSTS -- -- ONLY ON BILLING

06:46:19.722 --> 06:46:21.123
AND INSURANCE RELATED COSTS IT

06:46:21.190 --> 06:46:22.224
THERE IF THERE ARE OTHER COSTS

06:46:22.291 --> 06:46:23.659
THAT -- THAT THE COST SAVINGS

06:46:23.726 --> 06:46:25.694
FOR HOSPITAL CITIZENS AND AND

06:46:25.761 --> 06:46:28.063
HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS -- SO

06:46:28.130 --> 06:46:29.832
THAT IS THE COST CONTAINMENT

06:46:29.898 --> 06:46:32.501
-- QUESTION BREAK THERE IN

06:46:32.568 --> 06:46:35.070
AND OF ITSELF ON ON EIGHTY ONE

06:46:35.137 --> 06:46:36.605
THIRTY ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS

06:46:36.672 --> 06:46:38.607
BECAUSE -- HOSPITALS WOULDN'T

06:46:38.674 --> 06:46:42.044
HAVE TO DEAL WITH HUNDREDS

06:46:42.111 --> 06:46:45.214
OF OF -- INSURANCE PLANS --

06:46:45.414 --> 06:46:47.082
DOCTORS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO

06:46:47.149 --> 06:46:48.150
HAVE TO DO THAT AND THERE'D

06:46:48.217 --> 06:46:49.752
BE TIME SAVINGS ASSOCIATED

06:46:49.818 --> 06:46:52.354
TO WHICH AGAIN WOULD BE -- --

06:46:52.421 --> 06:46:54.523
ENSURING THAT -- THERE'D BE

06:46:54.590 --> 06:46:56.859
MORE MORE ABILITY OF DOCTORS

06:46:56.925 --> 06:46:58.360
TO PRIVATE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

06:46:58.427 --> 06:47:02.197
CARE -- AND ANOTHER HUGE PART

06:47:02.264 --> 06:47:04.366
IS THE NEGOTIATING POWER OF

06:47:04.433 --> 06:47:06.401
THE SYSTEM ITSELF TO NEGOTIATE

06:47:06.468 --> 06:47:09.371
-- SAVINGS AND DRUG PRICES

06:47:09.438 --> 06:47:11.874
AND AND -- AND RATES GENERALLY

06:47:11.940 --> 06:47:13.442
AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA

06:47:13.509 --> 06:47:15.077
SAID YOU KNOW THERE WOULD BE

06:47:15.144 --> 06:47:17.513
PRICE NEGOTIATIONS -- BOTH

06:47:17.579 --> 06:47:19.948
WAYS HOSPITALS DIRECTLY EACH

06:47:20.015 --> 06:47:21.416
INDIVIDUAL HOSTER HOSPITAL

06:47:21.483 --> 06:47:23.819
DIRECTLY AND WITH OTHER TYPES

06:47:23.886 --> 06:47:25.988
OF PROVIDERS AND THAT WOULD

06:47:26.054 --> 06:47:28.657
-- BE ABLE TO LOWER COSTS SO

06:47:28.724 --> 06:47:30.759
THAT IT IT SO THAT WE HAVE SOME

06:47:30.826 --> 06:47:33.829
SANITY IN AND IN HOW DOCTORS

06:47:33.896 --> 06:47:35.597
ARE PAID TO THAT PART -- MENTAL

06:47:35.664 --> 06:47:37.232
HEALTH SERVICES AND PRIMARY

06:47:37.299 --> 06:47:38.767
CARE PHYSICIANS WOULD BE PAID

06:47:38.834 --> 06:47:40.235
MORE WHEREAS IF THERE ARE

06:47:40.302 --> 06:47:42.037
PROCEDURE BASED TYPES OF CARE

06:47:42.104 --> 06:47:44.640
THAT THAT WE COULD NEGOTIATE

06:47:44.706 --> 06:47:46.108
LOWER PRICES IF IT IF IT'S

06:47:46.175 --> 06:47:48.977
APPROPRIATE -- ALSO I'VE HEARD

06:47:49.044 --> 06:47:50.279
YOU SAY THAT ACTUALLY EARLIER

06:47:50.345 --> 06:47:51.547
TODAY I GUESS MY QUESTION

06:47:51.613 --> 06:47:53.115
IS BESIDES BE A RADICAL COST

06:47:53.182 --> 06:47:54.783
CONTAINMENT ARE THERE SPECIFIC

06:47:54.850 --> 06:47:57.319
CAPS FOR THE STATE IN ALL OF

06:47:57.386 --> 06:48:00.455
THIS IN THEIR SPENDING WE ARE

06:48:00.522 --> 06:48:03.292
NOT WE DON'T HAVE A HISTORY OF

06:48:03.358 --> 06:48:05.561
STAYING ON BUDGET UNFORTUNATELY

06:48:05.627 --> 06:48:08.130
NOT IN OUR TECH PROJECTS NOT IN

06:48:08.197 --> 06:48:10.265
ANY OF OUR PROJECTS REALLY SO

06:48:10.332 --> 06:48:12.367
MY QUESTION IS I UNDERSTAND THE

06:48:12.434 --> 06:48:13.836
THEORY I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME

06:48:13.902 --> 06:48:15.270
OF IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE POSSIBLE

06:48:15.337 --> 06:48:17.206
HOWEVER MY QUESTION IS IS WE

06:48:17.272 --> 06:48:19.107
REQUIRE OTHERS TO HAVE SPECIFIC

06:48:19.174 --> 06:48:20.642
CAPS HAVE WE DECIDED TO PUT

06:48:20.709 --> 06:48:22.711
SPECIFIC CAPS ON OURSELVES

06:48:27.449 --> 06:48:29.084
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE I

06:48:29.151 --> 06:48:30.485
WONDER RATE HERE SO WE HAVE

06:48:30.552 --> 06:48:31.787
HAD THIS DISCUSSION THIS IS

06:48:31.854 --> 06:48:33.021
THAT YOU KNOW I THE DISCUSSION

06:48:33.088 --> 06:48:34.823
THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE HEALTHY

06:48:34.890 --> 06:48:36.391
CALIFORNIA FOR ALL COMMISSION

06:48:36.458 --> 06:48:38.527
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT HOW CAN

06:48:38.594 --> 06:48:42.164
WE HAVE OVERALL -- OVERALL

06:48:42.231 --> 06:48:44.066
COST CONTROLS OF THE SYSTEM

06:48:44.132 --> 06:48:47.269
ITSELF AND YOU KNOW IT IT IT'S

06:48:47.336 --> 06:48:49.204
IMPORTANT THAT -- ONE WE'RE

06:48:49.271 --> 06:48:50.772
HAVING THIS DISCUSSION TONIGHT

06:48:50.839 --> 06:48:52.040
AND YOU KNOW I THINK WE WE CAN

06:48:52.107 --> 06:48:53.342
HAVE MORE OF THESE DISCUSSIONS

06:48:53.408 --> 06:48:56.511
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT -- ACA LEVIN

06:48:56.578 --> 06:48:59.014
-- IT'S SET TO POTENTIALLY YOU

06:48:59.081 --> 06:49:01.083
DON'T HAVE TO HAVE SOME SOME

06:49:01.149 --> 06:49:02.885
GOLDEN TO MONITOR THE SYSTEM

06:49:02.951 --> 06:49:07.222
-- NOW DO WE WANT EXPLICIT

06:49:07.289 --> 06:49:09.057
CAP THAT THAT THERE WOULD BE

06:49:09.124 --> 06:49:10.592
EXPLICIT SPENDING LIMITS I

06:49:10.659 --> 06:49:11.894
THINK THAT WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL

06:49:11.960 --> 06:49:13.161
TO THE SYSTEM BECAUSE THAT'S

06:49:13.228 --> 06:49:15.264
HOW HE HOW WOULD THE SYSTEM MAY

06:49:15.330 --> 06:49:18.533
NOT GROW APPROPRIATELY BASED ON

06:49:18.600 --> 06:49:21.236
-- BASED ON THE CONSUMER PRICE

06:49:21.303 --> 06:49:23.538
INDEX -- BUT BASED ON DIFFERENT

06:49:23.605 --> 06:49:25.908
-- CHANGES IN HOW HEALTHCARE

06:49:25.974 --> 06:49:28.744
STRUCTURED -- AND IT AND --

06:49:28.810 --> 06:49:31.513
GDP GDP GROWTH -- ALL OF THESE

06:49:31.580 --> 06:49:33.415
THINGS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO

06:49:33.482 --> 06:49:35.684
CONSIDER AND YOU KNOW WE DON'T

06:49:35.751 --> 06:49:39.121
ENVISION EXPLICIT -- EXPLICIT

06:49:39.187 --> 06:49:40.956
COST CAPS WHERE THEY'RE

06:49:41.023 --> 06:49:42.357
SPENDING LIMITS THAT WE HAVE

06:49:42.424 --> 06:49:44.860
TO WE HAVE TO COME BACK TO ALL

06:49:44.927 --> 06:49:47.095
OF YOU -- YEAR AFTER YEAR TO

06:49:47.162 --> 06:49:48.931
INCREASE THE THE BUDGET I THINK

06:49:48.997 --> 06:49:50.232
THAT WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL FOR

06:49:50.299 --> 06:49:51.867
THE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA

06:49:51.934 --> 06:49:53.268
AND THAT'S HOW WE ACTUALLY END

06:49:53.335 --> 06:49:55.304
UP GETTING INTO THE SITUATION

06:49:55.370 --> 06:49:57.139
WHERE WE MIGHT HAVE A LIMITED

06:49:57.205 --> 06:49:59.174
BUDGET -- WORD THERE MIGHT HAVE

06:49:59.241 --> 06:50:01.143
TO BE SOME CUTS TO THE BENEFIT

06:50:01.209 --> 06:50:02.344
AND AND THAT IS NOT WHAT WE

06:50:02.411 --> 06:50:05.147
WANT AND I HATE TO SAY THIS

06:50:05.213 --> 06:50:06.615
BUT NOW WE'RE STARTING USING

06:50:06.682 --> 06:50:08.283
THOSE EXCUSES MAKES US TO START

06:50:08.350 --> 06:50:09.751
SO MAKING THE HEALTH INSURANCE

06:50:09.818 --> 06:50:11.753
COMPANY SO WITH THAT AND

06:50:11.820 --> 06:50:12.854
WE'VE HAD A YEAR TO HAVE THESE

06:50:12.921 --> 06:50:14.089
DISCUSSIONS AND I THINK PART OF

06:50:14.156 --> 06:50:15.457
THE FRUSTRATION I THINK YOU'RE

06:50:15.524 --> 06:50:17.059
SEEING FROM NOT JUST MYSELF BUT

06:50:17.125 --> 06:50:18.393
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES IS THAT

06:50:18.460 --> 06:50:19.695
THESE CONVERSATION SHOULD HAVE

06:50:19.761 --> 06:50:21.663
BEEN HAD OVER THE LAST YEAR THE

06:50:21.730 --> 06:50:22.898
FACT THAT THIS BILL IS BEING

06:50:22.965 --> 06:50:25.200
ASKED TO BE PASSED NOW AND HAVE

06:50:25.267 --> 06:50:27.402
CONVERSATIONS LATER MAKES VERY

06:50:27.469 --> 06:50:30.372
LITTLE LOGICAL SENSE BUT HAVING

06:50:30.439 --> 06:50:32.541
SAID THAT I WOULD SAY THAT

06:50:32.607 --> 06:50:33.775
HAVE THE OPPOSITION ACTUALLY

06:50:33.842 --> 06:50:35.210
WORKED ON COST CONTAINMENT AND

06:50:35.277 --> 06:50:36.545
HEALTH CARE FOR ALL WE PROBABLY

06:50:36.611 --> 06:50:37.446
WOULDN'T STILL BE HAVING THIS

06:50:37.512 --> 06:50:39.147
CONVERSATION SO ON SOME LEVEL

06:50:39.214 --> 06:50:40.515
I ACTUALLY APPLAUD CNA FOR

06:50:40.582 --> 06:50:42.250
THEIR TENACITY IN PUSHING THIS

06:50:42.317 --> 06:50:44.052
BILL AND THIS CONCEPT UNTIL

06:50:44.119 --> 06:50:45.554
YESTERDAY THERE THEY REALLY

06:50:45.620 --> 06:50:46.955
WERE THE ONLY ONES THAT IT

06:50:47.022 --> 06:50:48.690
TAKEN PEN TO PAPER IN SEARCH

06:50:48.757 --> 06:50:50.459
OF THIS OF A SOLUTION TO CHIEF

06:50:50.525 --> 06:50:51.493
HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR THE

06:50:51.560 --> 06:50:52.594
GREATEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE AT

06:50:52.661 --> 06:50:54.329
THE LOWEST COST BECAUSE QUITE

06:50:54.396 --> 06:50:56.398
FRANKLY WE WE AND WHEN I SAY

06:50:56.465 --> 06:50:58.266
WE I MEAN ALL OF US HAVE FAILED

06:50:58.333 --> 06:50:59.334
TO PRODUCE ANYTHING TO THE

06:50:59.401 --> 06:51:01.937
CONTRARY THOUGH I HOPE THROUGH

06:51:02.004 --> 06:51:03.438
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND THE

06:51:03.505 --> 06:51:05.007
CHAIR'S OFFICE ACCOUNTABILITY

06:51:05.073 --> 06:51:06.341
SOON A LOT OF THAT'S GOING TO

06:51:06.408 --> 06:51:08.944
CHANGE TO THE AUTHOR'S COMMENTS

06:51:09.011 --> 06:51:10.245
I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE

06:51:10.312 --> 06:51:12.881
ACA IS NOT REQUIRED TO PASS

06:51:12.948 --> 06:51:14.282
THIS BILL AND IT IS A HUNDRED

06:51:14.349 --> 06:51:15.517
AND SIXTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR

06:51:15.584 --> 06:51:16.818
TAX INCREASE NOT JUST FOR

06:51:16.885 --> 06:51:18.120
BUSINESS BUT FOR THOSE MAKING

06:51:18.186 --> 06:51:19.254
FORTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS

06:51:19.321 --> 06:51:21.857
AND UP THE TAXI THAT TAX

06:51:21.923 --> 06:51:23.258
UBLE INCOME OF THOSE MAKING A

06:51:23.325 --> 06:51:24.559
HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE THOUSAND

06:51:24.626 --> 06:51:26.428
AND UP WILL BE TAXED TWICE A

06:51:26.495 --> 06:51:28.764
PAYROLL TAX AND AN INCOME TAX

06:51:28.830 --> 06:51:30.098
AS WELL AS A SWIPE AT PROP

06:51:30.165 --> 06:51:31.666
NINETY EIGHT EDUCATION FUNDS

06:51:31.733 --> 06:51:33.568
BEGAN LIMIT PROP THIRTEEN

06:51:33.635 --> 06:51:34.870
AND MAKING TAX FOR THIS ONE

06:51:34.936 --> 06:51:36.271
MAJORITY VOTE INSTEAD OF TWO

06:51:36.338 --> 06:51:38.573
THIRDS THAT BEING SAID IF AB

06:51:38.640 --> 06:51:39.941
FOURTEEN HUNDRED PASSES THIS

06:51:40.008 --> 06:51:42.244
COMMITTEE TODAY AND THE ACA IS

06:51:42.310 --> 06:51:43.378
REFERRED WHICH IT SOUNDS LIKE

06:51:43.445 --> 06:51:44.946
NOW IT'S NOT EVEN SOMETHING

06:51:45.013 --> 06:51:46.014
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT BEING

06:51:46.081 --> 06:51:48.316
REFERRED -- IF IT'S IF IT'S

06:51:48.383 --> 06:51:50.719
REFER TO MY COMMITTEE THEN WE

06:51:50.786 --> 06:51:52.721
WILL HAVE THAT CONVERSATION

06:51:52.788 --> 06:51:53.822
AND I WANT TO ASSURE EVERYONE

06:51:53.889 --> 06:51:54.823
THAT THAT CONSTITUTIONAL

06:51:54.890 --> 06:51:57.492
AMENDMENT WILL BE DISCUSSED I

06:51:57.559 --> 06:51:59.227
THINK IF WE PASS THIS AND WE

06:51:59.294 --> 06:52:00.662
DON'T DISCUSS PROPOSED FUNDING

06:52:00.729 --> 06:52:02.764
MECHANISM WE ARE MAKING EVEN

06:52:02.831 --> 06:52:04.199
MORE OF A MOCKERY OF THIS

06:52:04.266 --> 06:52:06.501
PROCESS I WILL NOT SUPPORT A

06:52:06.568 --> 06:52:08.437
CA AND ITS CURRENT FORM BUT

06:52:08.503 --> 06:52:10.172
IF THIS BODY DEEMS IT FIT TO

06:52:10.238 --> 06:52:11.973
PASS AND UNFUNDED SINGLE PAYER

06:52:12.040 --> 06:52:13.108
BILL THEN WE NEED TO FIGURE

06:52:13.175 --> 06:52:15.010
OUT HOW TO PAY FOR IT AND I

06:52:15.077 --> 06:52:16.178
WANT TO ASSURE EVERYONE THAT

06:52:16.244 --> 06:52:20.048
CONVERSATION WILL BE HAD HI

06:52:20.482 --> 06:52:21.817
AND THIS IS THE HARDEST PART

06:52:21.883 --> 06:52:24.352
FOR ME IS THAT THE TRUTH IS

06:52:24.419 --> 06:52:26.721
IF WE DON'T WE ARE EXACTLY

06:52:26.788 --> 06:52:28.623
WHAT THE PEOPLE DISTRUST ABOUT

06:52:28.690 --> 06:52:30.492
THIS SYSTEM WE ARE PASSING

06:52:30.559 --> 06:52:32.194
SOMETHING TO BENEFIT PEOPLE

06:52:32.260 --> 06:52:33.895
BUT IT'S REALLY JUST AN MPC

06:52:33.962 --> 06:52:35.263
SIMPLE SIMPLE IF IT'S NOT

06:52:35.330 --> 06:52:37.833
JOINED TO A FUNDING MECHANISM

06:52:38.066 --> 06:52:39.301
IT DOES NOT BRING HEALTH CARE

06:52:39.367 --> 06:52:41.236
TO EVEN ONE MORE PERSON WITHOUT

06:52:41.303 --> 06:52:44.272
TWENTY THIS BILL HAS BEEN SOLD

06:52:44.339 --> 06:52:46.508
TO MY COMMUNITY THAT IT IS

06:52:46.575 --> 06:52:48.543
GOING TO CHANGE THINGS NOW AND

06:52:48.610 --> 06:52:50.445
THAT IT IS FREE AND NEITHER

06:52:50.512 --> 06:52:52.714
ONE OF THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE

06:52:52.781 --> 06:52:54.816
I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR

06:52:54.883 --> 06:52:56.284

06:52:56.351 --> 06:52:57.552
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TOWARD

06:52:57.619 --> 06:52:58.720
OVER THESE LAST FEW YEARS OF

06:52:58.787 --> 06:53:01.323
THIS PROCESS AND UP UNTIL NOW

06:53:01.389 --> 06:53:02.824
IT HAS BEEN A VERY THANKLESS

06:53:02.891 --> 06:53:05.327
PROCESS AND I AM AWARE OF IT

06:53:05.393 --> 06:53:06.962
BUT I TRULY HOPE THAT IN THE

06:53:07.028 --> 06:53:08.563
WEEKS TO COME WE TRULY PROVIDE

06:53:08.630 --> 06:53:10.065
AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL

06:53:10.132 --> 06:53:13.268
CALIFORNIANS IF WE CAN DO THAT

06:53:13.335 --> 06:53:15.203
WE CAN MOVE FROM A PROMISE

06:53:15.270 --> 06:53:19.374
TO CHANGE NVAX I BELIEVE IT'S

06:53:19.441 --> 06:53:21.476
SOMETHING WE CAN BE PROUD OF

06:53:21.543 --> 06:53:24.045
I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS

06:53:26.481 --> 06:53:27.916

THINGS -- A PRETTY CLEAR

06:53:54.342 --> 06:53:55.911
IMPLICATION THAT SOMEHOW I

06:53:55.977 --> 06:53:57.012
HAD TO DO SOMETHING AND THEN

06:53:57.078 --> 06:53:58.847

06:54:23.205 --> 06:54:24.706
MEETINGS AND CONVERSATIONS

-- SPONSORS OUT AS WELL

06:54:28.510 --> 06:54:29.744
I'VE SPOKEN WITH DOZENS OF

06:54:29.811 --> 06:54:31.012
COLLEAGUES MOST OF THEM ON

06:54:31.079 --> 06:54:32.180
THEIR OWN URGING AND THEY REACH

06:54:32.247 --> 06:54:33.114
OUT TO ME AND I'VE TALKED TO

06:54:33.181 --> 06:54:37.052
THEM -- AND YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN

06:54:37.118 --> 06:54:38.119

06:54:38.186 --> 06:54:39.421
ACCESSIBLE IS USUALLY NOT ONE

06:54:39.487 --> 06:54:41.556
OF THEM BUT IF I FOR A REASON

06:54:41.623 --> 06:54:43.558
-- YOU KNOW COLLEAGUES FEEL

06:54:43.625 --> 06:54:45.260
THAT WAY I APOLOGIZE THAT'S

06:54:45.327 --> 06:54:47.095
MY FEELING NOT THE FEELING

06:54:47.162 --> 06:54:48.463
OF THE SPONSORS OR THOSE THAT

06:54:48.530 --> 06:54:51.032
ARE ADVOCATING FOR THIS BILL

06:54:51.099 --> 06:54:54.502
I WILL SAY THAT THERE WAS

06:54:54.569 --> 06:54:58.173
NO ASSURANCES -- WHEN WHEN I

06:54:58.740 --> 06:55:02.277
HELD THE BILL IN APRIL -- THAT

06:55:02.344 --> 06:55:04.713
WOULD BE HEARD IT AND I KNEW

06:55:04.779 --> 06:55:07.249
THAT AT THE TIME -- THERE IS

06:55:07.315 --> 06:55:09.651
NO ASSURANCES THAT -- BUT WE

06:55:09.718 --> 06:55:11.753
WOULD BE HERE TODAY AND I SAY

06:55:11.820 --> 06:55:15.690
THAT BECAUSE WHAT THAT ALLOWED

06:55:15.757 --> 06:55:19.027
FOR IN A GOOD WAY WAS FOR ME TO

06:55:19.094 --> 06:55:21.396
NUMBER CONTINUE TO DO MY STUDY

WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF HHS

06:55:25.133 --> 06:55:27.135
AND -- IN WASHINGTON DC I THINK

06:55:27.202 --> 06:55:29.571
THAT HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT IN

06:55:29.638 --> 06:55:31.973
IN THE BILL BEING REFERRED IN

06:55:32.040 --> 06:55:32.907

06:57:26.921 --> 06:57:29.591
AND -- THAT THAT NEED TO BE

06:57:29.657 --> 06:57:31.526
RESOLVED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH

06:57:31.593 --> 06:57:33.495
SPECIFICITY -- TO PUT INTO

06:57:33.561 --> 06:57:37.065
THE BILL BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT

06:57:38.333 --> 06:57:40.635
THE SPONSORS AND MYSELF HAVE

06:57:40.702 --> 06:57:42.804
ABSOLUTELY PUSH FOR MANAGEMENT

06:57:42.871 --> 06:57:46.341
OF TIME INTO PREPARING FEEDBACK

06:57:47.609 --> 06:57:49.444
MMHM IN THE PHARMACY JORDANA

06:57:49.511 --> 06:57:51.279
FEEDBACK YOU'VE GOTTEN HAS BEEN

06:57:51.346 --> 06:57:55.183
ON FUNDING -- AND AS OPPOSED

06:57:55.250 --> 06:57:57.185
TO ANY OTHER LEGISLATOR THAT

06:57:57.252 --> 06:57:59.053
IS STILL IN THIS BUILDING IN

06:57:59.120 --> 06:58:01.890
THE PAST WE PUT FOR FUNDING

06:58:01.956 --> 06:58:03.691
NO ONE'S ON THE BEFORE IS A

06:58:03.758 --> 06:58:04.826
PERFECT PEOPLE HAVE ISSUES WITH

06:58:04.893 --> 06:58:06.528
IT THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO

06:58:06.594 --> 06:58:07.429
THE WHOLE POINT OF PUTTING IT

06:58:07.495 --> 06:58:10.031
OUT THERE SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT

06:58:10.098 --> 06:58:11.733
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THAT

06:58:11.800 --> 06:58:14.135
CAN BE ANALYZED AND DISCUSSED

06:58:14.202 --> 06:58:16.805
AND DEBATED AND CHANGED --

06:58:16.871 --> 06:58:20.742
ACCORDINGLY AND THEN SO THAT

06:58:20.809 --> 06:58:23.478
THAT WAS REALLY THE THE PRIMARY

06:58:23.545 --> 06:58:26.748
-- HOLD UP IN TERMS OF THE

06:58:26.815 --> 06:58:29.150
BILL -- NOT BEING HEARD OF

06:58:29.217 --> 06:58:31.019
LAST YEAR THAT IS SOMETHING

06:58:31.085 --> 06:58:33.588
WE WORKED WE WE WORKED ON TO

06:58:33.655 --> 06:58:35.356
TRY TO PUT SOMETHING FORWARD

06:58:35.423 --> 06:58:38.159
-- THAT WE FEEL IS PROGRESSIVE

06:58:38.226 --> 06:58:40.428
I KNOW THAT THE CHAIR BURKE

06:58:40.495 --> 06:58:42.697
-- INDICATE SOME CONCERNS IN

06:58:42.764 --> 06:58:44.365
THE THEIR LEGITIMATE CONCERNS

06:58:44.432 --> 06:58:46.468
BUT THE REALITY IS THAT RIGHT

06:58:46.534 --> 06:58:48.403
NOW EMPLOYERS PAY NINE POINT

06:58:48.470 --> 06:58:49.604
NINE PERCENT OF PAYROLL FOR

06:58:49.671 --> 06:58:51.272
HEALTHCARE EMPLOYEES PAY TWO

06:58:51.339 --> 06:58:52.807
POINT SEVEN PERCENT THE BILL

06:58:52.874 --> 06:58:54.943
FOR HEALTHCARE AND SAW ONE

06:58:55.009 --> 06:58:56.244
POINT TWO FIVE PERCENT PAYROLL

06:58:56.311 --> 06:59:00.281
TAX FOR EMPLOYERS IS FAR MORE

06:59:00.849 --> 06:59:02.717
GENEROUS -- BUT AGAIN I KNOW

06:59:02.784 --> 06:59:04.652
WE'RE NOT HERE TO DEBATE FACING

06:59:04.719 --> 06:59:07.055
A LOT OF US WANT TO MENTION

06:59:07.121 --> 06:59:09.390
THAT THESE CONSIDERATIONS HAVE

06:59:09.457 --> 06:59:10.658
BEEN MADE IN TERMS OF THE FIRST

06:59:10.725 --> 06:59:11.759
ITERATION HAS BEEN PUT OUT

06:59:11.826 --> 06:59:13.328
THERE THAT DOES ALLOW US THE

06:59:13.394 --> 06:59:15.897
TIME -- THE DIVE DEEPER INTO

06:59:15.964 --> 06:59:20.301
IT -- AND IT IS CERTAINLY MY

06:59:20.368 --> 06:59:22.070
INTENTION IF IT'S THE WILL OF

06:59:22.136 --> 06:59:24.172
OF OF THE SERVER OF OF HAVE YOU

06:59:24.239 --> 06:59:25.573
TAXATION TO HAVE THE BILL HEARD

06:59:25.640 --> 06:59:28.209
IS NOT A IT WASN'T PUT FORWARD

06:59:28.276 --> 06:59:30.545
A FOR ANY OTHER REASON BUT IN

06:59:30.612 --> 06:59:32.080
TERMS OF THE ORDER OF THINGS AS

06:59:32.146 --> 06:59:34.182
I MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT WHERE

06:59:34.249 --> 06:59:36.451
BIRTH FOLLOWING AN ORDER THAT

06:59:36.518 --> 06:59:39.654
ALLOWS A WAIVER TO BE APPLIED

06:59:39.721 --> 06:59:42.257
FOR -- IT WAS VERY DIRECTLY IN

06:59:42.323 --> 06:59:43.791
THIS IS GONNA BE MET FOR WELL

06:59:43.858 --> 06:59:45.593
OVER AN HOUR THE DEPARTMENT

06:59:45.660 --> 06:59:46.661
HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES THERE

06:59:46.728 --> 06:59:49.264
ARE VERY CLEAR THAT LEGISLATIVE

06:59:49.330 --> 06:59:51.132
AUTHORITY THROUGH A POLICY BILL

06:59:51.199 --> 06:59:52.534
NEEDS TO BE PASSED EVEN APPLY

06:59:52.600 --> 06:59:55.737
FOR A WAIVER -- AND THE FISCAL

06:59:55.803 --> 06:59:56.971
COMPONENT OF IT DOES NOT NEED

06:59:57.038 --> 06:59:57.805
TO BE PART OF THAT AND THE

06:59:57.872 --> 06:59:59.974
REASON WHY IS THAT THE WAIVER

07:00:00.041 --> 07:00:01.442
APPLICATION PROCESS HOUSE TO

07:00:01.509 --> 07:00:04.012
SPEAK TO THE LARGER FINANCING

07:00:04.412 --> 07:00:05.079
AND WHAT YOU WOULD NEED IN

07:00:05.146 --> 07:00:07.582
THE FINANCING ON ULTIMATELY

07:00:07.649 --> 07:00:09.651
ABSOLUTELY VOTERS CAN VOTE

07:00:09.717 --> 07:00:12.120
SOMETHING DOWN ABSOLUTELY --

07:00:12.353 --> 07:00:13.454
SOMETHING MAY NOT MAKE IT ALL

07:00:13.521 --> 07:00:15.523
THE WAY TO THE GOAL LINE --

07:00:15.590 --> 07:00:18.493
AND YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT

07:00:18.560 --> 07:00:21.262
THE FIRST TIME THAT -- THIS

07:00:21.329 --> 07:00:22.497
ENFORCEMENT TRIED I SAID THAT

07:00:22.564 --> 07:00:23.464
THE BEGINNING AS WELL THAT

07:00:23.531 --> 07:00:27.035
IT'S THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF

07:00:27.635 --> 07:00:29.370
TRYING TO BE PERFECT IT'S A

07:00:29.437 --> 07:00:32.206
MATTER OF UNDERSTANDING THAT

07:00:34.809 --> 07:00:36.811
WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN OUR

07:00:36.878 --> 07:00:38.212
SYSTEM EVEN WITH ALL THE

07:00:38.279 --> 07:00:39.847
WORK THAT SURE WOULD AND SO

07:00:39.914 --> 07:00:40.815
MANY YOU DON'T OVER THE YEARS

07:00:40.882 --> 07:00:43.051
WERE STILL SEEING INCREASING

07:00:43.284 --> 07:00:44.218
HEALTHCARE COSTS WERE STILL

07:00:44.285 --> 07:00:45.720
SAYING LACK OF ACCESS WE'RE

07:00:45.787 --> 07:00:47.722
STILL SEEING PEOPLE DYING WE'RE

07:00:47.789 --> 07:00:49.824
STILL SEEING THAT THERE ISN'T

07:00:49.891 --> 07:00:51.225
THAT MANY O'CLOCK THAT MEET

07:00:51.292 --> 07:00:53.528
MEANINGFUL ACCESS AS OPPOSED

07:00:53.595 --> 07:00:54.996
TO JUST HAVING INSURANCE

07:00:55.063 --> 07:00:56.731
VERSUS REALLY GETTING THE

07:00:56.798 --> 07:00:59.667
CARE -- OF THAT IS GOING TO

07:00:59.734 --> 07:01:01.169
SAVE YOUR LIFE OR MAKERS I

07:01:01.235 --> 07:01:03.771
PERSONALLY BETTER BOB THAT IS

07:01:03.838 --> 07:01:05.840
WHY THE SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE

07:01:05.907 --> 07:01:08.409
PROGRAM WHICH IS BEEN STUDIED

07:01:10.244 --> 07:01:12.380
FOR YEARS -- AND I KNOW IT'S

07:01:12.447 --> 07:01:13.881
EASY TO SAY POINT ONE COUNTRY

07:01:13.948 --> 07:01:15.550
OTHER LOOK WE'RE NOT CANADA WE

07:01:15.617 --> 07:01:16.951
HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN CANADA HAS

07:01:17.018 --> 07:01:18.786
PROVINCIALLY RUN SYSTEMS NOT

07:01:18.853 --> 07:01:20.421
A SINGLE PROVINCE IN CANADA

07:01:20.488 --> 07:01:22.457
IS ANYWHERE NEAR THE SIZE OF

07:01:22.523 --> 07:01:23.658
OUR STATE FOR THE SIZE OF OUR

07:01:23.725 --> 07:01:27.495
ECONOMY AND SO -- YOU KNOW IT

07:01:27.562 --> 07:01:29.097
IT I KNOW THAT WENDELL POTTER

07:01:29.163 --> 07:01:31.833
OF FORMER INSURANCE INDUSTRY

07:01:32.266 --> 07:01:34.902
EXECUTIVE -- SILVA SPEAKS OF

07:01:34.969 --> 07:01:36.838
HOW HE WAS VERY INTENTIONALLY

07:01:36.904 --> 07:01:37.805
HIT ATTENTIONAL PART OF THE

07:01:37.872 --> 07:01:39.374
INSURANCE INDUSTRY THE BEST

07:01:39.440 --> 07:01:41.643
CANADA AND TO BASH IT IS TO

07:01:41.709 --> 07:01:42.810
MAKE PEOPLE AFRAID OF DOING

07:01:42.877 --> 07:01:45.413
ANYTHING THAT IS DIFFERENT --

07:01:45.480 --> 07:01:47.248
I KNOW THAT NO ONE HERE EXCEPT

07:01:47.315 --> 07:01:48.650
THE STATUS QUO AND THAT'S WHY

07:01:48.716 --> 07:01:50.351
ALSO SAID IN THE INTRO THAT

07:01:50.418 --> 07:01:51.486
WORK IS BEEN DONE HAS BEEN

07:01:51.552 --> 07:01:53.755
CLEARED HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT

07:01:53.821 --> 07:01:55.857
THE STATUS QUO IS NOT ACCEPTED

07:01:55.923 --> 07:01:57.091
BY THOSE IN THIS COMMITTEE OR

07:01:57.158 --> 07:02:00.461
A BODY -- BUT WHAT I BELIEVE

07:02:00.528 --> 07:02:04.332
TO BE TRUE IS THAT A SINGLE

07:02:04.399 --> 07:02:06.067
PAYER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND

07:02:06.134 --> 07:02:07.201
IF IF THERE ARE ISSUES OF

07:02:07.268 --> 07:02:08.369
THE THAT THE CHAIR I THINK

07:02:08.436 --> 07:02:10.938
RAISES SOME ISSUES WITH --

07:02:11.005 --> 07:02:12.273
FOURTEEN HUNDRED I THINK OUR

07:02:12.340 --> 07:02:15.143
ARE REASONABLE -- ISSUES FOR

07:02:15.209 --> 07:02:18.146
US TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON OTHER

07:02:18.212 --> 07:02:19.080
OTHER FOLKS THAT HAVE LOOKED

07:02:19.147 --> 07:02:21.149
AT IT AS AS KIM WANT TO TREAT

07:02:21.215 --> 07:02:23.618
THIS SOME LANGUAGE ISSUE THERE

07:02:23.685 --> 07:02:25.486
FOR GOVERNANCE ISSUES THOSE

07:02:25.553 --> 07:02:27.622
ARE ALL THINGS THAT -- WE'RE

07:02:27.689 --> 07:02:29.657
WE'RE WE'RE TAKING IN AND MORE

07:02:29.724 --> 07:02:31.793
THAN HAPPY TO NOT JUST TALK

07:02:31.859 --> 07:02:33.428
ABOUT THE TO AMEND IN ORDER TO

07:02:33.494 --> 07:02:37.031
ENSURE THAT IT'S A BILL THAT

07:02:37.098 --> 07:02:39.500
WORKS BUT LIKE I SAID WITH

07:02:39.567 --> 07:02:41.869
THIS BILL HAS BEEN AROUND --

07:02:41.936 --> 07:02:43.771
FOR QUITE SOME TIME I'VE I'VE

07:02:43.838 --> 07:02:45.006
I'VE SPOKEN TO MANY COLLEAGUES

07:02:45.073 --> 07:02:48.076
ABOUT IT AND WE'VE GOTTEN VERY

07:02:48.576 --> 07:02:50.478
OTHER THAN FROM THE CHAIR OF

07:02:50.545 --> 07:02:52.680
THE STUFF ANALYSIS FROM WE

07:02:52.747 --> 07:02:54.649
HAVEN'T GOTTEN DIRECT REQUEST

07:02:54.716 --> 07:02:56.718
TO AMEND -- FROM COLLEAGUES

07:02:56.784 --> 07:02:58.853
WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN MANY DIRECT

07:02:58.920 --> 07:03:00.354
REQUEST TO AMEND FOR OUTSIDE

07:03:00.421 --> 07:03:01.923
ENTITIES EXCEPT FOR THOSE THAT

07:03:01.989 --> 07:03:06.160
OPPOSE IT -- AND SO YOU KNOW

07:03:06.561 --> 07:03:09.630
I'M LOOKING OUT I'M I'VE BEEN

07:03:09.697 --> 07:03:10.832
HERE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN HERE

07:03:10.898 --> 07:03:13.000
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN MADE MYSELF

07:03:13.067 --> 07:03:15.169
AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE --

07:03:15.236 --> 07:03:16.304
AND OVER THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS

07:03:16.370 --> 07:03:18.039
WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AND

07:03:18.106 --> 07:03:19.373
LOOK FOR THE BLOCKING OFF HOURS

07:03:19.440 --> 07:03:21.909
AND HOURS OF MY TIME -- FOR

07:03:21.976 --> 07:03:23.611
ANYONE THAT WANTS TO MEET OR

07:03:23.678 --> 07:03:25.246
HAVE THEIR STATUS MEET WITH ME

07:03:25.313 --> 07:03:27.915
TO DISCUSS DETAILS OF THE BILL

07:03:27.982 --> 07:03:29.717
AND TO HAVE QUESTIONS ANSWERED

07:03:29.784 --> 07:03:31.452
THIS IS A STARTING POINT IN

07:03:31.519 --> 07:03:33.521
TERMS OF A LONGER PROCESS

07:03:33.588 --> 07:03:35.223
AS THE CHAIR ASKED EARLIER

07:03:35.289 --> 07:03:39.794
HONEST CONVERSATIONS BUT WAIT

07:03:39.861 --> 07:03:42.196
A MINUTE THINKING ABOUT WHAT

07:03:42.263 --> 07:03:44.699
WE NEED TO DO IN TERMS OF I

07:03:44.766 --> 07:03:45.933
HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN

07:03:46.000 --> 07:03:48.803
A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM I THINK

07:03:48.870 --> 07:03:50.037
ABOUT THOSE THAT ARE SUFFERING

07:03:50.104 --> 07:03:50.938
THERE'S PLENTY OF PEOPLE THAT

07:03:51.005 --> 07:03:52.173
SUFFER IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM

07:03:52.240 --> 07:03:53.107
THAT WE NEED TO BE THERE FOR

07:03:53.174 --> 07:03:55.877
THEM WE NEED TO BE THERE FOR

07:03:55.943 --> 07:03:57.078
OF THOSE PLACES THAT DON'T

07:03:57.145 --> 07:03:59.847
GET HURT -- FOR THOSE THAT ARE

07:03:59.914 --> 07:04:01.482
STUCK IN A JOB OR AN ABUSIVE

07:04:01.549 --> 07:04:03.351
RELATIONSHIP AND DON'T LEAVE

07:04:03.417 --> 07:04:04.385
BECAUSE THEY HAVE HEALTH CARE

07:04:04.452 --> 07:04:05.753
THEY DON'T WANT TO LOSE IT FOR

07:04:05.820 --> 07:04:07.121
THOSE LAWS ON HOUSE NEIGHBORS

07:04:07.188 --> 07:04:09.290
THAT FELL INTO HOMELESSNESS

07:04:09.357 --> 07:04:11.526
BECAUSE OF MEDICAL BILLS --

07:04:11.592 --> 07:04:14.996
AND FOR THE YOUNGER GENERATION

07:04:15.062 --> 07:04:17.098
AN ADULT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT

07:04:17.165 --> 07:04:19.066
WE WANT TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY

07:04:19.133 --> 07:04:20.101
YEARS AND ANOTHER GROUP OF

07:04:20.168 --> 07:04:21.469
LEGISLATORS ARE GRAPPLING WITH

07:04:21.536 --> 07:04:23.104
OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS EVEN

07:04:23.171 --> 07:04:24.906
THAT MUCH MORE OUT OF REACH

07:04:24.972 --> 07:04:26.974
AND THAT MUCH MORE PAINFUL

07:04:27.041 --> 07:04:30.378
FOR CALIFORNIANS -- I HEAR THE

07:04:30.444 --> 07:04:31.612
CRITICISM I HEAR THE CRITICISM

07:04:31.679 --> 07:04:33.114
OF THE PERSONAL CRITICISM

07:04:33.181 --> 07:04:35.449
OF MYSELF -- BUT I WILL SAY

07:04:35.516 --> 07:04:36.784
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

07:04:36.851 --> 07:04:39.854
I TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY -- THIS

07:04:39.921 --> 07:04:41.823
SOMETHING AB FOUR TWO HUNDRED I

07:04:41.889 --> 07:04:44.425
BELIEVE IS A VERY WELL WRITTEN

07:04:44.492 --> 07:04:46.694
POLICY BILL AND IT IS TAKEN

07:04:46.761 --> 07:04:48.796
INTO ACCOUNT MANY DIFFERENT

07:04:48.863 --> 07:04:50.965
ELEMENTS OF PAST BILLS AND

07:04:51.032 --> 07:04:52.733
FEEDBACK FROM COMMITTEES AND

07:04:52.800 --> 07:04:55.469
COMMISSIONS AND STUDIES -- IT'S

07:04:55.536 --> 07:04:57.171
BETTER THAN FIVE SIX TWO THE
