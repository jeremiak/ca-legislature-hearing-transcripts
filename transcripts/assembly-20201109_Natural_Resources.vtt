COMING PRIOR TO THE LEGISLATOR-

00:25:26.224 --> 00:25:27.025
I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING

00:25:27.092 --> 00:25:28.560
WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:25:28.627 --> 00:25:30.395
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. AND THIS

00:25:30.462 --> 00:25:31.496
IS BEEN A SUBJECT THAT HAS BEEN

00:25:31.563 --> 00:25:32.898
VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO OUR HEART

00:25:32.964 --> 00:25:35.100

IMAGINE NOT NINETEEN FIFTY

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.882

PRESCRIBE BURNING HERE IN. IT

00:29:32.537 --> 00:29:33.538
WAS REALLY FIRST DONE ALL

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:36.441
PRIVATE LANDS. SO THERE WAS

00:29:36.508 --> 00:29:39.144
STRONG AGREEMENT- ABOUT HOW TO

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:40.512
DO THE SOME OF THIS WORK FROM A

00:29:40.578 --> 00:29:42.180
FEW INDIVIDUALS BUT- I WOULD

00:29:42.247 --> 00:29:43.014

00:29:43.081 --> 00:29:44.582
MISSED OPPORTUNITY OF. THE

00:29:54.726 --> 00:29:56.561
ISSUE AND OTHERS SO I DON'T

00:29:56.628 --> 00:29:57.762
WANT TO BELIEVE THAT POINT BUT

00:29:57.829 --> 00:29:59.063
I WOULD JUST SAY WE'RE WE'VE

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:00.532
GOT SOME HISTORY ON THIS TOPIC

00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:01.466

00:30:01.533 --> 00:30:02.700
MORE OPPORTUNITY I THINK

00:30:02.767 --> 00:30:04.035
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT MORE.

00:30:04.102 --> 00:30:07.038

THAT. FUNDS UNDER THE WORKFORCE.

00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:11.176
WE DO NOT HAVE A FORCE OF

WORKFORCE PRESCRIBED FIRE IN

00:30:12.777 --> 00:30:13.978
THIS STATE SOMETHING I THINK WE

00:30:14.045 --> 00:30:15.613
REALLY HAVE TO FOCUS ON. BOTH

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.415

INCREASE THE YOUNG. WORK FORCE.

00:30:33.264 --> 00:30:33.765
THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE

REALLY HAVE TO DO OUT HERE. WE

00:30:34.432 --> 00:30:35.400

THE QUEUE. WE REALLY CAN'T GET

00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:42.707
HIM DOWN ON THE EDGE OF THE

00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:44.709
WILDFIRE SEASON. BUT WINTER AND

TWENTY TWENTY NO IT'S NOT THAT

00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:52.617
LONG AGO. MAYBE REMEMBER

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:54.085
FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY WE NEED

00:30:54.152 --> 00:30:55.954
ANY RAIN OR ANY SNOW IN THE

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.622
SIERRA NEVADA. TALK ABOUT AN

00:30:57.689 --> 00:31:00.358
OPPORTUNITY TO DO PRESCRIBED

00:31:00.425 --> 00:31:01.326
BURNING AT SCALE. I THINK THERE

00:31:01.392 --> 00:31:02.594
WAS A LOT WE HAVE TO TAE

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.095
BECAUSE WE'RE NEVER GONNA DO.

00:31:04.162 --> 00:31:05.930
ACRES AND THAT SCALE WE NEED

00:31:05.997 --> 00:31:07.899
UNLESS WE REALLY OPEN UP SOME

00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:09.467
OF THESE PERIODS TO BURNING.

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:10.802
BECAUSE JUST LIKE RIGHT NOW

00:31:10.868 --> 00:31:12.237
WITH OUR THREE FIRES WERE A

00:31:12.303 --> 00:31:13.204
LITTLE BIT STYMIED BUT IF YOU

00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:15.073
HAVE A WHOLE MONTH IN FEBRUARY

00:31:15.139 --> 00:31:16.407
WHEN IT'S RELATIVELY DRY. YOU

00:31:16.474 --> 00:31:18.243
CAN REALLY TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY.

00:31:18.309 --> 00:31:19.711
AT THAT TIME MOST OF OUR

00:31:19.777 --> 00:31:20.211
FIREFIGHTING FORCES ARE

00:31:20.278 --> 00:31:22.080
COMPLETELY GONE. YEAH THIS IS

00:31:22.146 --> 00:31:23.248
OUTSIDE THE FIRE SEASON THAT'S

00:31:23.314 --> 00:31:24.115
WHY WE NEED A DEDICATED

00:31:24.182 --> 00:31:25.717
PRESCRIBE FAR WORKING FOR CHRIS

00:31:25.783 --> 00:31:27.285
TAKE OPPORTUNITIES. MAYBE ON

00:31:27.352 --> 00:31:29.153
THE SCALE 2225% OF OUR

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.521
SUPPRESSION FORCE MAYBE THAT

00:31:30.588 --> 00:31:33.391
SOUNDS CRAZY BUT IT'S GONNA

00:31:33.458 --> 00:31:34.359
TAKE SOME SIGNIFICANT EFFORT.

00:31:34.425 --> 00:31:35.326
FLORIDA HAS BEEN A LEADER

00:31:35.393 --> 00:31:36.427
PRESCRIBED BURNING FOR MANY

00:31:36.494 --> 00:31:38.029
MANY YEARS AND I HAVE TO TIP MY

00:31:38.096 --> 00:31:39.330
HAT TO THEM ALSO GEORGIA

00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:41.766
ANOTHER. AND TWO THOUSAND

00:31:41.833 --> 00:31:42.333
EIGHTEEN THEY HAD A VERY BAD

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.335
EVENT. PRESCRIBED FIRE WAS DONE

00:31:44.402 --> 00:31:45.970
I THOUGHT IT WAS OVER. A FEW

00:31:46.037 --> 00:31:47.538
DAYS LATER IT REKINDLED

00:31:47.605 --> 00:31:48.673
THUNDERSTORM CAME IN AND

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.275
BASICALLY MOVE THIS FAR INTO

00:31:50.341 --> 00:31:52.210
URBAN AREA BURNED DOWN THIRTY

00:31:52.277 --> 00:31:54.312
SIX HOUSES. ONE THING YOU HAVE

00:31:54.379 --> 00:31:55.280
TO SAY ABOUT THIS IS CERTAINLY

00:31:55.346 --> 00:31:56.648
A TRAGEDY. BUT ONE THING THAT'S

00:31:56.714 --> 00:31:59.350
REALLY INTERESTING. WE DIDN'T

00:31:59.417 --> 00:32:00.385
EVEN HEAR ABOUT IT OUT HERE.

00:32:00.451 --> 00:32:01.719
WHAT HAPPENED WAS IS THAT. THEY

00:32:01.786 --> 00:32:03.121
HAVE SUCH A MATURE PROGRAM

00:32:03.187 --> 00:32:03.821
WOULD ENABLE THEM TO GET

00:32:03.888 --> 00:32:05.590
THROUGH THAT TRAGIC EVENT. AND

00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:07.592
CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. CAN

00:32:07.659 --> 00:32:08.760
YOU IMAGINE THIRTY SIX HOUSES

00:32:08.826 --> 00:32:10.061
NO ONE WAS HURT. NO ONE WAS

00:32:10.128 --> 00:32:11.763
KILLED THAT'S GREAT BUT THIRTY

00:32:11.829 --> 00:32:12.497
SIX HOUSES BURNED IN A

00:32:12.563 --> 00:32:13.831
PRESCRIBED FIRE THAT REKINDLES

00:32:13.898 --> 00:32:16.034
AFTER A FEW DAYS AND THE SYSTEM

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.935
CONTINUES OPERATES. THEY JUST

00:32:18.002 --> 00:32:20.104
HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE STRONG

00:32:20.171 --> 00:32:21.606
PROGRAM WITH A LOT OF HISTORY.

00:32:21.673 --> 00:32:23.341
THE LIABILITY COVERAGE IS ONE

00:32:23.408 --> 00:32:24.142
OF THE KEYS TO FLORIDA'S

00:32:24.208 --> 00:32:26.878
PROGRAM. AND EVEN MYSELF IN TWO

00:32:26.944 --> 00:32:27.845
THOUSAND ONE I WORKING ON SEVEN

00:32:27.912 --> 00:32:28.980
PRESCRIBED FIRES OF BLODGETT

00:32:29.047 --> 00:32:30.815
FORCE RESEARCH STATION. TWO

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:31.949
THREE DAYS LATER ONE OF THEM

00:32:32.016 --> 00:32:33.851
REKINDLED WE HAVE ESCAPED. THE

00:32:33.918 --> 00:32:35.320
FOR SERVER GEORGETOWN RANGER

00:32:35.386 --> 00:32:36.287
DISTRICT CAME IN AS A PRESS

00:32:36.354 --> 00:32:37.889
THAT FILE WORSE BECAUSE WE HAVE

00:32:37.955 --> 00:32:39.457
A CONTINGENCY PLAN. SO THESE

00:32:39.524 --> 00:32:40.425
ARE THE KINDS OF EVENTS ARE

00:32:40.491 --> 00:32:41.693
GOING TO HAPPEN. I JUST THINK

00:32:41.759 --> 00:32:42.960
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT AS

00:32:43.027 --> 00:32:44.429
WE GO FOR WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE

00:32:44.495 --> 00:32:45.630
THAT TO. REALLY GET TO STYMIE

00:32:45.697 --> 00:32:50.601
THE WHOLE PROGRAM OUT THE GATE.

00:32:50.668 --> 00:32:51.102
AS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE

00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:51.703
PROBLEMS I GUARANTEE IT. WHAT

00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:52.770
AUSTRALIA A- AREA OF THE I. OF

00:32:52.837 --> 00:32:54.105
THE WORD. WITH THE LARGEST

00:32:54.172 --> 00:32:55.707
PRESCRIBED FIRE PROGRAM IN THE

MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE. HAS A

00:32:57.442 --> 00:32:58.576
MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE JUST LIKE

00:32:58.643 --> 00:33:00.278
US. RICH NEED JACK IS THE HEAD

00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:01.679
OF THE PRESCRIBER PROGRAM YOU

00:33:01.746 --> 00:33:02.914
WORKED THERE FOR MANY MANY MANY

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.916
YEARS. THEY BROUGHT UP THE FIVE

00:33:04.982 --> 00:33:05.516
HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR

00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:07.151
ROUND PERTH. HE CAME OVER HERE

00:33:07.218 --> 00:33:08.553
SEVERAL YEARS AGO I TOOK HIM UP

00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:09.387
AND DOWN THE STATEMENT WITH A

00:33:09.454 --> 00:33:11.122
BUNCH OF MANAGERS. HE HAD SOME

00:33:11.189 --> 00:33:12.890
OBSERVATIONS- IN QUOTES WE

00:33:12.957 --> 00:33:14.125
BEGIN WITH THE MOST DIFFICULT

00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:16.060
FUEL LOADED LANDSCAPES. ARE

00:33:16.127 --> 00:33:17.662
LANDSCAPE ARE IN TOP CONDITION

00:33:17.729 --> 00:33:19.063
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MOSAIC

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.998
OF FUEL TO BASE WITH WORK WITH.

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:22.400
AS THEY DO SAY IN WESTERN

00:33:22.467 --> 00:33:23.968
AUSTRALIAAND ALSO IN FLORIDA.

00:33:24.035 --> 00:33:25.403
SO WE BEGIN AT A VERY DIFFICULT

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:26.738
SITUATION FROM A LANDSCAPE

00:33:26.804 --> 00:33:28.373
PERSPECTIVE. WE ALSO HAVE THE

00:33:28.439 --> 00:33:29.974
LOWEST EXPERIENCE AND POLITICAL

00:33:30.041 --> 00:33:31.142
SUPPORT THERE'S ANOTHER QUOTE

00:33:31.209 --> 00:33:32.443
FROM RICK. THIS IS REALLY

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:33.911
IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO

00:33:33.978 --> 00:33:35.380
BRING ALONG BOTH THE PUBLIC AND

00:33:35.446 --> 00:33:36.547
ALSO INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT AS

00:33:36.614 --> 00:33:38.416
WE HAVE. GROWING PAINS THIS IS

00:33:38.483 --> 00:33:39.217
SOMETHING WE NEED TO REALLY

00:33:39.283 --> 00:33:40.785
ADDRESS. WE CAN USE THE

00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:41.853
WILDFIRES THAT HAVE HAPPENED

00:33:41.919 --> 00:33:43.654
THE LAST FEW YEARS AS THE MOST

00:33:43.721 --> 00:33:44.422
SAY IT. IS NOT THE MOSAIC WE

00:33:44.489 --> 00:33:45.656
REALLY WOULD LIKE. BUT WE

00:33:45.723 --> 00:33:46.858
CERTAINLY CAN USE THEM TO

00:33:46.924 --> 00:33:48.393
ACTUALLY BUILD A PROGRAM ON. I

00:33:48.459 --> 00:33:49.861
GAVE A TALK ABOUT TEN DAYS AGO

00:33:49.927 --> 00:33:51.095
TO THE NAPA COUNTY VINEYARD

00:33:51.162 --> 00:33:52.397
ASSOCIATION BECAUSE THEY ARE

00:33:52.463 --> 00:33:53.898
SO. INTERESTED IN ALSO TRYING

00:33:53.965 --> 00:33:55.500
TO. REDUCE NEGATIVE IMPACTS

00:33:55.566 --> 00:33:56.367
FROM SMOKE TAINT AND OTHER

00:33:56.434 --> 00:33:58.169
THINGS. SIERRA NEVADA NORTH

00:33:58.236 --> 00:34:00.104
COAST. SANTA CRUZ COUNTY WE GOT

00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:01.606
A MOSAIC WE CAN USE.

00:34:01.672 --> 00:34:03.274
INTERAGENCY COOPERATION WILL BE

00:34:03.341 --> 00:34:04.742
KEY INDIGENOUS BURNING I THINK

00:34:04.809 --> 00:34:06.043
IS REALLY AS I'VE HEARD ALREADY

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.379
IS A KEY POINT. IN JUST BURNING

00:34:08.446 --> 00:34:10.481
COULD BE A- BUNCH OF INNOVATION

00:34:10.548 --> 00:34:12.016
IF THE TRIBES CHOSE TO WORK

00:34:12.083 --> 00:34:13.718
WITH US IT'S UP TO THEM. BUT I

00:34:13.785 --> 00:34:14.252
WOULD JUST SAY AND TO JUST

00:34:14.318 --> 00:34:15.420
BRING COULD BE A KEY UP AND

00:34:15.486 --> 00:34:17.355
DOWN THE STATE. I SAY ONE TO

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:18.790
TWO DECADES WE GOT ONE TO TWO

00:34:18.856 --> 00:34:19.524
DECADES TO REALLY CHANGE THE

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.092
TRAJECTORY WE DON'T DO THAT.

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:22.326
I'M AFRAID THE WILD LANDS ARE

00:34:22.393 --> 00:34:23.528
GONNA CHANGE RIGHT IN FRONT OF

00:34:23.594 --> 00:34:25.496
OUR EYES. I'M OPTIMISTIC. BUT

00:34:25.563 --> 00:34:27.131

00:36:39.797 --> 00:36:40.998
WILL BE AN INCREASED RISK OF

00:36:41.065 --> 00:36:42.900
ASTHMA RELATED EVENTS AFTER

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:44.902
WILDFIRE SMOKE EXPOSURE- THIS

00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:45.937
IS MAKE CONSISTENTLY

00:36:46.003 --> 00:36:46.938
DEMONSTRATED THROUGHOUT THE

00:36:47.004 --> 00:36:49.240
GLOBE- THERE'S ALSO INCREASES

00:36:49.307 --> 00:36:50.641
AND OTHER RESPIRATORY OUTCOMES

00:36:50.708 --> 00:36:53.110
LIKE INCREASES IN OUR EMERGENCY

00:36:53.177 --> 00:36:53.477
ROOM VISITS AND

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:55.580
HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR COPD AND

00:36:55.646 --> 00:36:57.315
RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS.

00:36:57.381 --> 00:37:00.751
POSITION VISITS AND ASSOCIATED

00:37:00.818 --> 00:37:01.819
MEDICATION USE. IN ADDITION

00:37:01.886 --> 00:37:02.787
THERE'S INCREASES IN

00:37:02.853 --> 00:37:05.156
CARDIOVASCULAR. SUCH AS HEART

00:37:05.222 --> 00:37:08.492
ATTACKS A RADIUS. RT ACT REST

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:09.660
AND EVEN THERE ARE A LOT

00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:12.863
OUTCOME SUCH AS SMOKE FIRST

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:15.333
STROKE WHEN WE WHILE TRY SMOKE

00:37:15.399 --> 00:37:16.300
IN THE EVENT ARE DEPENDENT ON

00:37:16.367 --> 00:37:17.902
THE LAW OF TIME THE SMOKE

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:20.938
INHALE AND THE- OF THE SMOKE.

00:37:21.005 --> 00:37:22.406
IN ADDITION TO THE AGE IN THE

00:37:22.473 --> 00:37:23.708
PRE EXISTING HEALTH CONDITIONS

00:37:23.774 --> 00:37:26.877
OF AN INDIVIDUAL. SO THE

00:37:26.944 --> 00:37:27.778
INTENSITY INTO OF THIS YEAR'S

00:37:27.845 --> 00:37:29.981
WILDFIRE BUMPER. AND THERE'S

00:37:30.047 --> 00:37:31.616
ACTIVE RESEARCH IN TRYING TO

00:37:31.682 --> 00:37:33.551
DETERMINE. THE HEALTH IMPACTS

00:37:33.618 --> 00:37:34.919
THAT IT WILL HAPPEN EVERYONE-

00:37:34.986 --> 00:37:40.725
ON EVERYONE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE

00:37:40.791 --> 00:37:43.461
WHY DID THAT THE IMPACT OF PM

00:37:43.527 --> 00:37:44.762
TWO POINT FIVE ACTUALLY COMES

00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:46.998
FROM THE AIR CARE THE TRAILER

00:37:47.064 --> 00:37:50.167
BACK LET ME JUST WILDFIRE I'M

00:37:50.234 --> 00:37:51.669
SORRY DOT EIGHTY OF WILD

00:37:51.736 --> 00:37:54.639
DOCTORS DO YOU HAVE A- I JUST

00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:57.308
pOF FEEDBACK DO YOU HAVE A

00:37:57.375 --> 00:37:59.310
MONITOR THAT'S PLAYING THIS I

00:37:59.377 --> 00:38:01.612
CAN HEAR THAT ALSO OKAY. NO I

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:07.585
DON'T OKAY- COLLEGE AND. WE

00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:09.387
JUST TRIED CLOSING MY- BUT MAKE

00:38:09.453 --> 00:38:15.359
HER CLOSING MY BROWSER IN CASE.

00:38:15.426 --> 00:38:17.328
SECOND OKAY LET'S SEE IF THAT

00:38:17.395 --> 00:38:23.200
PROVES THAT. SO FROM THE AIR

00:38:23.267 --> 00:38:26.537
POLLUTION- LITERATURE WE KNOW

00:38:26.604 --> 00:38:29.306
THAT PM TWO POINT FIVE IS

00:38:29.373 --> 00:38:30.474
EXTREMELY DETRIMENTAL TO OUR

00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:32.143
HEALTH AND ITS ROLE BUT WHEN WE

00:38:32.209 --> 00:38:33.544
TALK ABOUTTHE WILDFIRES

00:38:33.611 --> 00:38:36.447
BECAUSE OVER 80% OF WILDFIRE

00:38:36.514 --> 00:38:37.448
SMOKE IS TYPICALLY PM TWO POINT

00:38:37.515 --> 00:38:39.250
FIVE. ONCE THE DINNER THE

00:38:39.316 --> 00:38:41.352
ENTERS THE BODY. AND CROSSES IT

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:43.320
AT THE LEVEL BE. OF THE LONG IT

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:45.256
CAN TRAVEL THROUGHOUT BECAUSE

00:38:45.322 --> 00:38:47.291
WIDESPREAD IMPACT. SO NOT ONLY

00:38:47.358 --> 00:38:48.225
CAN THERE BE RESPIRATORY

00:38:48.292 --> 00:38:49.727
CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS LIKE WE

00:38:49.794 --> 00:38:52.897
MENTIONED BUT ALSO- CANCER. AND

00:38:52.963 --> 00:38:54.565
ASSOCIATE IMMUNE SYSTEM

00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:58.569
DYSFUNCTION IS ASSOCIATED. WITH

00:38:58.636 --> 00:39:00.204
EXPOSURE TO PM TWO POINT FIVE

00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:01.639
THE ACTUAL BIOLOGY OF THE

00:39:01.706 --> 00:39:03.474
POLLUTION EXPOSURE TO IT'S AN

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:07.178
ACTIVE INVESTIGATION. IF WE

00:39:07.244 --> 00:39:13.250
COULD GO TO FLIGHT FIVE. FOR

00:39:13.317 --> 00:39:15.219
EXAMPLE- GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE

00:39:15.286 --> 00:39:16.454
OF PRESCRIBED BURNING A

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.823
WILDFIRE MANAGEMENT WE WANTED

00:39:18.889 --> 00:39:20.558
TO EXAMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE

00:39:20.624 --> 00:39:21.158
ARE DIFFERENTIAL HEALTH

00:39:21.225 --> 00:39:22.293
CONSEQUENCES BETWEEN A

00:39:22.359 --> 00:39:24.095
PRESCRIBED FIRE VERSIONS OF

00:39:24.161 --> 00:39:26.764
WILDFIRE. AND WE HAD ALREADY

00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:30.468
COLLECTED SAMPLE BLOOD SAMPLES

00:39:30.534 --> 00:39:31.102
FROM CHILDREN LIVING IN FRESNO

00:39:31.168 --> 00:39:35.172
CALIFORNIA AND- RETROSPECTIVELY

00:39:35.239 --> 00:39:38.609
WE LOOK TO SEE WHETHER SUBJECT-

00:39:38.676 --> 00:39:40.344
HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO EITHER A

00:39:40.411 --> 00:39:42.847
WILDFIRE OR PRESCRIBED BURNS

00:39:42.913 --> 00:39:45.516
ARE. AT LEAST THREE MONTHS

00:39:45.583 --> 00:39:47.251
PRIOR TO THE BLOOD DRAW- AND

00:39:47.318 --> 00:39:50.087
THE FIRE TO FIRES ARE ABOUT THE

00:39:50.154 --> 00:39:51.856
SAME SIZE AND DURATION. NEXT

00:39:51.922 --> 00:39:56.560
SLIDE PLEASE. SO WHEN WE LOOKED

00:39:56.627 --> 00:39:59.130
AT WHAT CHILDREN FIT THE-

00:39:59.196 --> 00:40:00.498
CATEGORY WE FOUND THAT THERE

00:40:00.564 --> 00:40:02.166
ABOUT THIRTY TO SIXTY EIGHT

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:03.134
YEAR OLDS THAT HAD BEEN EXPOSED

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.935
HER SURGERY BURN IN YOUR SO

00:40:05.002 --> 00:40:06.904
MANY. AND ABOUT THIRTY SIX

00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:08.439
CHILDREN EXPOSED TO WILDFIRE OF

00:40:08.506 --> 00:40:10.508
ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AND THEN-

00:40:10.574 --> 00:40:12.209
DURATION. THE FIRE SERVICE

00:40:12.276 --> 00:40:14.812
WHERE ABOUT SEVENTY MILES AWAY-

00:40:14.879 --> 00:40:15.846
THERE WAS ALSO A CONTROL GROUP

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:17.782
FROM THE BAY AREA THE HADN'T

00:40:17.848 --> 00:40:19.617
THEY EXPOSED TO ANYTHING- SMOKE

00:40:19.683 --> 00:40:22.153
AT ALL. AND WE- ON THE RIGHT

00:40:22.219 --> 00:40:23.487
YOU CAN SEE THE GRAFT WE

00:40:23.554 --> 00:40:25.523
ANALYZED THE LEVEL OF. PM TWO

00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:26.957
POINT FIVE BEFORE DURING AND

00:40:27.024 --> 00:40:28.526
AFTER THE PRESCRIBED BURNS IN

00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:31.362
THE WILDFIRES- USING SATELLITE

00:40:31.428 --> 00:40:33.798
MONITORS- ENTRANCE NO ITSELF.

00:40:33.864 --> 00:40:34.698
AND THEN WE DISTRICTS WEIGHTED

00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:36.300
THE EXPOSURE BASED ON WHERE THE

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:40.838
PARTICIPANT LIVES. THE GREAT

00:40:40.905 --> 00:40:43.274
SHOWS THE AVERAGE AMOUNT PM

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.942
POINT. EITHER DURING THE FIRST

00:40:45.009 --> 00:40:47.511
ANOTHER WILD. AND AS YOU CAN

00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:48.679
SEE THE WILDFIRE PRESUMABLY

00:40:48.746 --> 00:40:50.214
GENERATED MORE POLLUTION THAN

00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:52.449
THE PRESCRIBED BURN. I SAY

00:40:52.516 --> 00:40:53.984
PRESUMABLY BECAUSE THE FEDERAL

00:40:54.051 --> 00:40:55.452
SITE MINDERS CAN'T DISCRIMINATE

00:40:55.519 --> 00:40:56.854
THE SOURCE OF THE POLLUTION SO

00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:59.156
THE SOURCE OF PM TWO POINT FIVE

00:40:59.223 --> 00:41:00.491
BUT THE PATTERN- SHOULD THE

00:41:00.558 --> 00:41:04.128
TIMING OF THE FIRES THEMSELVES.

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:07.731
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WHEN

00:41:07.798 --> 00:41:10.768
ANALYZING THE BLOOD WE FOUND

00:41:10.835 --> 00:41:14.004
THAT DAY THE EXPOSURE TO THE

00:41:14.071 --> 00:41:17.241
WILDFIRE- WAS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:19.610
MORE NEW DYSFUNCTION THAN THOSE

00:41:19.677 --> 00:41:21.011
EXPOSED TO EITHER THE

00:41:21.078 --> 00:41:23.080
PRESCRIBED BURNS OR- THE

00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:24.648
CONTROL GROUP WHICH WERE NOT

00:41:24.715 --> 00:41:27.852
EXPOSED TO FIRE AT ALL. THESE

00:41:27.918 --> 00:41:30.187
FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH

00:41:30.254 --> 00:41:30.821
OUR FINDINGS FROM AIR POLLUTION

00:41:30.888 --> 00:41:32.623
STUDIES. AND IT'S ALSO

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.091
CONSISTENT WITH ANOTHER STUDY

00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:35.459
WHERE WE LOOKED AT TEENAGERS

00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:37.261
FROM PRESS NOW EXPOSED TO A

00:41:37.328 --> 00:41:40.364
WILD FIRE- AGAIN IN YOSEMITE

00:41:40.431 --> 00:41:43.100
AND WE WERE ABLE TO SEE-

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:45.069
INCREASES AND TWO TYPES OF

00:41:45.135 --> 00:41:46.103
INFLAMMATORY MARKERS IN THE

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:50.040
BLOOD- AFTER EXPOSURE- AND BOTH

00:41:50.107 --> 00:41:51.342
OF THESE INFLAMMATORY

00:41:51.408 --> 00:41:54.311
BIOMARKERS HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED

00:41:54.378 --> 00:41:56.046
WITH POLLUTION EXPOSURE PRIOR.

00:41:56.113 --> 00:41:58.482
SO WE KNOW THAT SMOKE IMPACTS

00:41:58.549 --> 00:41:59.817
THE IMMUNE SYSTEM EVEN IN

00:41:59.884 --> 00:42:01.252
CHILDREN. AND THAT THE LONG

00:42:01.318 --> 00:42:02.987
TERM CONSEQUENCES ARE STILL NOT

00:42:03.053 --> 00:42:05.122
FULLY UNDERSTOOD- WE DON'T

00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:06.924
REALLY KNOW FOR THESE CHILDREN

00:42:06.991 --> 00:42:08.759
OR TEENAGERS IN THE FUTURE HOW

00:42:08.826 --> 00:42:11.228
THIS WILL IMPACT FOR EXAMPLE-

00:42:11.295 --> 00:42:14.031
THERE ARE RISKS FOR ADULT

00:42:14.098 --> 00:42:15.599
CHRONIC DISEASE. NEXT SLIDE

00:42:15.666 --> 00:42:21.205
PLEASE. CERTIFIED CHOSEN DATA

00:42:21.272 --> 00:42:22.539
HARMON JAFFE IN WHICH THEY

00:42:22.606 --> 00:42:23.874
COMPARED THE SIZE IN THE

00:42:23.941 --> 00:42:25.309
MANICHEAN TWO POINT FIVE

00:42:25.376 --> 00:42:26.610
GENERATED FROM ALL FROM

00:42:26.677 --> 00:42:29.513
WILDFIRES PERSIST PRESCRIBED

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.015
BURNS IN DIFFERENT STATES. AND

00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:33.083
AS YOU CAN SEE- RESPECT THE

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:34.718
AREA BURNED. THERE WAS MORE PM

00:42:34.785 --> 00:42:36.387
TWO POINT FIVE WHETHER MEASURED

00:42:36.453 --> 00:42:42.526
BY A MONTH OR DALY- YEAH

00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:44.495
DURING- WILDFIRE STAND

00:42:44.561 --> 00:42:46.363
PRESCRIBED BURNS. AND THIS IS

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:51.368
JUST TO- TISSUE THAT WHAT WE

00:42:51.435 --> 00:42:53.837
FOUND IN OUR VERY SMALL- STUDY

00:42:53.904 --> 00:42:56.106
IS CONSISTENT WITH SOME OF THE

00:42:56.173 --> 00:42:58.676
LITERATURE. SO ALTHOUGH THE

00:42:58.742 --> 00:43:00.177
AREAS BURNED BY THE PRESCRIBED

00:43:00.244 --> 00:43:01.845
FIRES WERE COMPARED BOTH TO THE

00:43:01.912 --> 00:43:03.480
WILD FIRE AREAS BURNED IN THE

00:43:03.547 --> 00:43:06.450
WEST THE PM TWO POINT FOUR FIVE

00:43:06.517 --> 00:43:07.985
EMISSIONS LOWER. ON THE AUTHORS

00:43:08.052 --> 00:43:09.954
FEEL THE DIFFERENCES DUE TO

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:10.421
BOTH THE FIELD IN THE

00:43:10.487 --> 00:43:11.855
MANAGEMENT PRACTICE THE

00:43:11.922 --> 00:43:15.526
SIMPSONS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE THE

00:43:15.592 --> 00:43:17.294
PROFESSOR COMING UP PASS SOME

00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:19.263
MINUTES IF YOU CAN TRY TO DO

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:20.631
THIS QUICKLY AND WRAP IT UP.

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:23.434
THANK YOU. OKAY HOW DO I GET

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.502
THIS VERY QUICKLY- WE CAN.

00:43:25.569 --> 00:43:28.138
PRESCRIBE SIZE ABOUT FIRES

00:43:28.205 --> 00:43:28.839
THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT.

00:43:28.906 --> 00:43:30.107
FIRST THE COMPOSITION OF THE

00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:32.676
POLLUTION- FOR EXAMPLE PM TWO

00:43:32.743 --> 00:43:33.744
POINT FIVE DEPENDS ON THE

00:43:33.811 --> 00:43:35.512
SOURCE OF WHAT'S BEING BURNED.

00:43:35.579 --> 00:43:37.014
SO THAT PAKISTAN WHILE LIBERTY

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:39.383
MAY BE VERY WELL LEFT TOXIC TO

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:41.485
THE HEALTH. AND AN OUT OF

00:43:41.552 --> 00:43:43.620
CONTROL WILDFIRE THAT ACTUALLY

00:43:43.687 --> 00:43:45.522
BURNING ACCOUNT OF BURNING UP

00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:46.724
CLEANING PRODUCTS AND MULTI

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:49.259
PLASTICS. THAT ARE- THERE'S

00:43:49.326 --> 00:43:52.463
OBVIOUS DISTANCES AND THE- D.

00:43:52.529 --> 00:43:54.064
DEFICIT THAT'S NOT TRAVELS FOR

00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:56.300
PRESCRIBERS OF THOSE WILDFIRES

00:43:56.367 --> 00:44:01.271
THE TIMING AND STRATEGY- CURLY

00:44:01.338 --> 00:44:01.839
IS DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO

00:44:01.905 --> 00:44:02.873
TYPES. I THEN THE AN INNER IS

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:05.342
THE FACT THE- FIRES IT'S

00:44:05.409 --> 00:44:07.778
POSSIBLE TO PROACTIVELY PLAN

00:44:07.845 --> 00:44:10.080
AND MINIMIZE EXPOSURE TO ANY-

00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:11.915
POPULATIONS IN ANY

00:44:11.982 --> 00:44:13.650
INCONVENIENCE TO THE PUBLIC. SO

00:44:13.717 --> 00:44:15.052
MY LAST SLIDE IS THE SUMMARY

00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:17.621
SLIDE. IN SUMMARY WILDFIRE

00:44:17.688 --> 00:44:20.157
SMOKE- INDEED MANY TOXINS THAT

00:44:20.224 --> 00:44:22.126
PREDOMINATES PM TWO POINT FIVE

00:45:29.893 --> 00:45:31.428
RECENT HISTORICAL CONTEXT FOR

FORCE ON THIS ISSUE I THINK

00:45:46.743 --> 00:45:47.444
THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD

00:45:47.511 --> 00:45:49.480
REALLY BE FOCUSED ON I AM GOING

00:45:49.546 --> 00:45:50.481

00:45:50.547 --> 00:45:52.049
LITTLE MORE SPECIFICALLY TO

00:45:52.116 --> 00:45:52.850
SOME OF THE BARRIERS AND

00:45:52.916 --> 00:45:54.852
OPPORTUNITIES THAT I SEE WITH

00:45:54.918 --> 00:45:56.920
REGARD TO COMMUNITY BASED-

00:45:56.987 --> 00:45:58.322
PRESCRIBED FIRE AND PRIVATE

00:45:58.388 --> 00:46:00.491
LANDS ISSUES. AND I GUESS I

00:46:00.557 --> 00:46:01.859
WANT TO START OFF JUST BY

00:46:01.925 --> 00:46:03.227
TALKING ABOUT THE HUGE

00:46:03.293 --> 00:46:05.195
GROUNDSWELL OF INTEREST AND

00:46:05.262 --> 00:46:05.696
PRESCRIBED FIRE AT THE

00:46:05.762 --> 00:46:07.364
COMMUNITY SCALE THAT WE'VE BEEN

00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:08.665
SEEING IN RECENT YEARS IT'S

00:46:08.732 --> 00:46:10.400
REALLY KIND OF UNPRECEDENTED

00:46:10.467 --> 00:46:12.236
FOR RECENT DECADES THREE YEARS

00:46:12.302 --> 00:46:13.470
AGO WHEN WE STARTED THE

00:46:13.537 --> 00:46:15.072
HUMBOLDT COUNTY PRESCRIBED BURN

00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:16.006
ASSOCIATION WHICH IS

00:46:16.073 --> 00:46:17.407
ESSENTIALLY A COMMUNITY

00:46:17.474 --> 00:46:18.509
COOPERATIVE FOR PRESCRIBED

00:46:18.575 --> 00:46:20.544
FIRE- WE WERETHE FIRST OF OUR

00:46:20.611 --> 00:46:23.280
KIND IN THE IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:46:23.347 --> 00:46:26.116
ACROSS THE WESTERN U. S. AND-

00:46:26.183 --> 00:46:27.885
YOU KNOW WE THERE AT THAT TIME

00:46:27.951 --> 00:46:29.987
THERE WERE SOME NGOS- SOME

00:46:30.053 --> 00:46:31.688
TRIBES AND PRIVATE LANDOWNERS

00:46:31.755 --> 00:46:32.823
WERE DOING SOME BURNING BUT

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:34.324
REALLY PRESCRIBED FIRE FOR A

00:46:34.391 --> 00:46:36.860
LONG TIME HAD BEEN. OWNED BY

00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:38.695
FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES AND

00:46:38.762 --> 00:46:39.429
THERE HADN'T BEEN A LOT OF

00:46:39.496 --> 00:46:41.131
SPACE FOR COMMUNITIES FOR

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:44.668
TRIBES- AND FOR PRIVATE FOLKS

00:46:44.735 --> 00:46:45.536
TO HAVE A YOU KNOW HAVE A KEY

00:46:45.602 --> 00:46:47.771
ROLE IN PRESCRIBED FIRE NOT

00:46:47.838 --> 00:46:49.806
THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM I'M JUST

00:46:49.873 --> 00:46:52.176
THREE YEARS LATER NOW THERE ARE

00:46:52.242 --> 00:46:53.110
TWELVE DIFFERENT COMMUNITY

00:46:53.177 --> 00:46:54.444
BASED PRESCRIBED BURN

00:46:54.511 --> 00:46:56.146
ASSOCIATION STYLE GROUPS ACROSS

00:46:56.213 --> 00:46:58.815
THE STATE- WE HAVE THESE TYPES

00:46:58.882 --> 00:47:00.150
OF GROUPS FORMED UP AND DOWN

00:47:00.217 --> 00:47:02.085
CALIFORNIA FROM HUMBLE AND

00:47:02.152 --> 00:47:03.086
SISKIYOU COUNTIES ALLTHE WAY

00:47:03.153 --> 00:47:04.588
DOWN TO PHYLLIS OBISPO AND

00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:05.956
SANTA BARBARA COUNTIES. AND

00:47:06.023 --> 00:47:09.459
FROM CINEMA AND MENDOCINO ALL

00:47:09.526 --> 00:47:11.495
THE WAY TO PLUMAS AND SEQUOIA

00:47:11.562 --> 00:47:13.230
LAW OF OTHER. IN BETWEEN SO

00:47:13.297 --> 00:47:14.865
THERE'S JUST A HUGE. GRANTS

00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:16.033
WHAT GROUNDS FULL OF INTEREST

00:47:16.099 --> 00:47:17.701
IN THIS KIND OF WORK. AND

00:47:17.768 --> 00:47:19.369
TRIBES ARE ALSO REINVIGORATING

00:47:19.436 --> 00:47:20.804
THEIR CULTURAL PRACTICES AND

00:47:20.871 --> 00:47:22.239
THEIR PRESCRIBED FIRE PROGRAMS

00:47:22.306 --> 00:47:23.006
WHICH WE'LL HEAR ABOUT FROM

00:47:23.073 --> 00:47:24.541
BILL AND MARGOT A LITTLE LATER

00:47:24.608 --> 00:47:26.743
IN THIS HEARING. AND LANDOWNERS

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:28.045
FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF

00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:29.846
BACKGROUNDS INCLUDING RANCHERS

00:47:29.913 --> 00:47:31.582
AND TIMBER LAND OWNERS AND BACK

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:32.482
TO THE LANDERS AND EVEN

00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:33.784
RESIDENTS IN WILDLAND URBAN

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:35.786
INTERFACE AREAS. ARE REALLY

00:47:35.852 --> 00:47:37.187
DEMANDING THAT PRESCRIBED FIRE

00:47:37.254 --> 00:47:38.455
BE BROUGHT BACK INTO THEIR TOOL

00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:40.390
BOX. SO I THINK WE'RE SEEING

00:47:40.457 --> 00:47:42.292
THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR

00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:43.594
ACTION AND COMMITMENT AT THE

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.662
STATE LEVEL ON THIS ISSUE. AND

00:47:45.729 --> 00:47:46.797
THAT WE REALLY NEED TO FIGURE

00:47:46.863 --> 00:47:48.832
OUT WAYS TO ENABLE AND EMPOWER

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:51.235
COMMUNITIES AND TRIBES AND- AND

00:47:51.301 --> 00:47:52.436
PRIVATE LANDOWNERS TO GET MORE

00:47:52.502 --> 00:47:54.004
INVOLVED AND TO NOT ONLY BE

00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:55.205
PARTNERS BUT REALLY TO BE

00:47:55.272 --> 00:47:57.741
LEADERS IN THIS WORK. SO THAT'S

00:47:57.808 --> 00:47:59.209
YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO

00:47:59.276 --> 00:48:00.711
PROLIFERATE PRESCRIBED FIRE THE

00:48:00.777 --> 00:48:02.045
SCALE THAT'S ACTUALLY.

00:48:02.112 --> 00:48:04.414
MEANINGFUL AND- AND CAN RESTORE

00:48:04.481 --> 00:48:05.949
OUR ECOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL

00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:08.218
VALUES. THEN WE NEED TO WE NEED

00:48:08.285 --> 00:48:09.786
TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AND

00:48:09.853 --> 00:48:10.621
REALLY POUR SOME ENERGY INTO

00:48:10.687 --> 00:48:12.756
IT. AND IF WE LOOK AT THE MOST

00:48:12.823 --> 00:48:14.124
SUCCESSFUL PRESCRIBED FIRE

00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:15.859
PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY PLACES

00:48:15.926 --> 00:48:18.395
LIKE FLORIDA AND GEORGIA- WE

00:48:18.462 --> 00:48:19.696
SEE THAT THEY HAVE CERTIFIED

00:48:19.763 --> 00:48:21.431
BURNER PROGRAMS AND GROSS

00:48:21.498 --> 00:48:23.667
NEGLIGENCE LIABILITY LAWS. AND

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:24.901
SOME WESTERN STATES LIKE

00:48:24.968 --> 00:48:26.436
WASHINGTON AND COLORADO HAVE

00:48:26.503 --> 00:48:28.972
ALSO MORE RECENTLY ADOPTED-

00:48:29.039 --> 00:48:30.607
DIFFERENT NEGLIGENCE STANDARDS

00:48:30.674 --> 00:48:31.808
THAT GO ALONG WITH CERTIFIED

00:48:31.875 --> 00:48:34.344
BURNER PROGRAMS. AND IN TWENTY

00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:35.178
EIGHTEEN WE IN CALIFORNIA

00:48:35.245 --> 00:48:37.247
PASSED SENATE BILL TWELVE SIXTY

00:48:37.314 --> 00:48:38.715
WHICH MANDATED THE DEVELOPMENT

00:48:38.782 --> 00:48:40.250
OF A STATE CERTIFIED BURN BOSS

00:48:40.317 --> 00:48:41.852
PROGRAM HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:48:41.918 --> 00:48:43.820
THIS WAS A REALLY BIG DEAL- I

00:48:43.887 --> 00:48:45.155
SERVED ON THE CURRICULUM

00:48:45.222 --> 00:48:46.223
DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE FOR THAT

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:48.992
PROGRAM. AND I'M PRETTY PLEASED

00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:50.827
WITH THE LEVEL OF RIGOR AND THE

00:48:50.894 --> 00:48:52.162
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH THAT WE

00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:53.297
TOOK IN OUR PROGRAM TO

00:48:53.363 --> 00:48:54.431
PRESCRIBED FIRE PLANNING AND

00:48:54.498 --> 00:48:56.867
IMPLEMENTATION- IT WILL ROLL

00:48:56.933 --> 00:48:58.835
OUT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:48:58.902 --> 00:49:00.470
PROBABLY IN MID SPRING. NOW THE

00:49:00.537 --> 00:49:01.672
STATE CERTIFIED BURN BOSS

00:49:01.738 --> 00:49:03.740
PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED

00:49:03.807 --> 00:49:05.008
IS REALLY INTENDED FOR

00:49:05.075 --> 00:49:06.877
EXPERIENCED PRESCRIBED FIRE

00:49:06.943 --> 00:49:09.446
PRACTITIONERS IT'S NOT ENTRY

00:49:09.513 --> 00:49:09.980
LEVEL IT'S GOING TO BE A

00:49:10.047 --> 00:49:11.915
RIGOROUS. THAT'S REALLY FOCUSED

00:49:11.982 --> 00:49:13.850
ON- ON PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:49:13.917 --> 00:49:15.252
WOULD LIKE TO PLAN AND LEAD

00:49:15.319 --> 00:49:17.087
PRESCRIBED FIRE PROJECTS.

00:49:17.154 --> 00:49:17.988
INCLUDING FEDERAL STATE AND

00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:20.057
LOCAL. BURN BOSSES WHO HAVE

00:49:20.123 --> 00:49:21.725
RETIRED BUT STILL WANT TO

00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:23.627
PARTICIPATE IN THIS WORK AND BE

00:49:23.694 --> 00:49:25.996
PART OF THE SOLUTION- COMMUNITY

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:28.098
AND TRIBAL LEADERS LIKE ME AND

00:49:28.165 --> 00:49:29.599
BILL AND MARGOT AND PROBABLY

00:49:29.666 --> 00:49:32.569
OTHERS. INVOLVED IN THIS PANEL-

00:49:32.636 --> 00:49:33.737
WHO WISH TO BUILD LOCAL

00:49:33.804 --> 00:49:35.772
CAPACITY IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND

00:49:35.839 --> 00:49:37.174
PRIVATE CONTRACTORS FOR HIM

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.042
THIS COULD BE A NEW NICHE. AS

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:40.444
WELL AS JUST PRIVATE LANDOWNERS

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:42.346
WHO WANT TO FURTHER THEIR OWN

00:49:42.412 --> 00:49:42.946
PRESCRIBED FIRE PROJECTS ON

00:49:43.013 --> 00:49:45.849
THEIR LAND. NOW I REALLY WORRY

00:49:45.916 --> 00:49:47.317
THAT THIS PROGRAM THAT WE'RE

00:49:47.384 --> 00:49:48.185
DEVELOPING IN THAT WE'RE

00:49:48.251 --> 00:49:50.053
ROLLING OUT. DOES NOT CONFER

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.555
ENOUGH BENEFIT TO THE STATE

00:49:51.621 --> 00:49:53.590
CERTIFIED BURN BOSSES- TO

00:49:53.657 --> 00:49:55.459
INCENTIVIZE PARTICIPATION OR TO

00:49:55.525 --> 00:49:57.461
EXPAND PRESCRIBED FIRE EFFORTS.

00:49:57.527 --> 00:50:01.064
ON A MEANINGFUL SCALE- PER SB

00:50:01.131 --> 00:50:01.898
TWELVE SIXTY BURN BOSSES WILL

00:50:01.965 --> 00:50:02.966
HAVE THE ABILITY TO SHARE

00:50:03.033 --> 00:50:04.401
LIABILITY WITH CAL FIRE THROUGH

00:50:04.468 --> 00:50:06.436
THE PERMIT PROCESS. I'M HOWEVER

00:50:06.503 --> 00:50:08.372
THEY WILL NOT ENJOY A DIFFERENT

00:50:08.438 --> 00:50:09.873
LIABILITY STANDARD LIKE THEIR

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:11.575
COUNTERPARTS IN OTHER STATES.

00:50:11.641 --> 00:50:13.310
AND THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO GET

00:50:13.377 --> 00:50:15.011
INSURANCE FOR THE WORK THAT

00:50:15.078 --> 00:50:15.645
THEY'RE DOING I SEE THIS AS A

00:50:15.712 --> 00:50:17.514
HUGE PROBLEM. PRESCRIBED FIRE

00:50:17.581 --> 00:50:18.749
INSURANCE IS BECOMING

00:50:18.815 --> 00:50:20.117
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO

00:50:20.183 --> 00:50:23.253
SECURE- BASICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.055
AND IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY A

00:50:25.122 --> 00:50:26.590
PROBLEM FOR PRIVATE BURN BOSSES

00:50:26.656 --> 00:50:28.492
AS WELL AS FOR ORGANIZATIONS

00:50:28.558 --> 00:50:30.127
AND CONTRACTORS WHO ARE LOOKING

00:50:30.193 --> 00:50:31.828
TO LEAVE THIS KIND OF WORK. SO

00:50:31.895 --> 00:50:32.963
I SEE THESE TWO POINTS THE

00:50:33.029 --> 00:50:34.064
LIABILITY PIECE IN THE

00:50:34.131 --> 00:50:35.499
INSURANCE PIECE AS TOP

00:50:35.565 --> 00:50:37.534
PRIORITIES FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE.

00:50:37.601 --> 00:50:39.569
IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW IF WE

00:50:39.636 --> 00:50:40.904
WANTTO SUPPORT EXPAND

00:50:40.971 --> 00:50:42.272
PRESCRIBED FIRE IN CALIFORNIA

00:50:42.339 --> 00:50:44.474
WE NEED TO ACTIVELY PURSUE A

00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:45.776
GROSS NEGLIGENCE STANDARD FOR

00:50:45.842 --> 00:50:47.677
STATE CERTIFIED BURN BOSSES-

00:50:47.744 --> 00:50:49.446
SOMETHING THAT COULD. TIE RIGHT

00:50:49.513 --> 00:50:50.547
INTO THE PROGRAM THAT E'RE

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:52.149
ROLLING OUT. AND WE SHOULD ALSO

00:50:52.215 --> 00:50:53.784
DEVELOP A CALIFORNIA PRESCRIBED

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:56.186
FIRE INSURANCE CLAIM FUND- THIS

00:50:56.253 --> 00:50:57.421
COULD BE MODELED AFTER THE FUN

00:50:57.487 --> 00:50:58.655
THAT WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE

00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:02.426
UTILITIES- WHERE YOU KNOW.

00:51:02.492 --> 00:51:03.794
WHERE THERE'S- I FIND THAT

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.262
COVER EXCEPT LOS. FOR A

00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:06.363
PRESCRIBED FIRE OVER A CERTAIN

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:07.898
AMOUNT THAT REALLY INCENTIVIZE

00:51:07.964 --> 00:51:09.733
IS THE PRIVATE INSURERS TO

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.635
PROVIDE OPTIONS POLICY OPTIONS

00:51:11.701 --> 00:51:13.570
FOR. PRIVATE BURN BOSSES AND

00:51:13.637 --> 00:51:14.671
FOR ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE

00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:16.273
IMPLEMENTING THIS KIND OF WORK.

00:51:16.339 --> 00:51:17.707
SO THOSE THOSE TWO PIECES I

00:51:17.774 --> 00:51:18.475
THINK ARE REALLY REALLY

00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:20.010
IMPORTANT. THEY'RE ALSO

00:51:20.076 --> 00:51:21.578
REGULATORY BARRIERS TO THE

00:51:21.645 --> 00:51:23.313
EXPANDED USE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:24.681
AND FOR STATE LETTER STATE

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:26.716
FUNDED PROJECTS THE CALIFORNIA

00:51:26.783 --> 00:51:27.851
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT C.

00:51:27.918 --> 00:51:29.753
QUOTE. I'M CAN RESULT IN REALLY

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:31.021
COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING

00:51:31.087 --> 00:51:33.123
PLANNING PROCESS. THAT CAN

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:35.292
CREATE DELAYS AND PLANNING COST

00:51:35.358 --> 00:51:36.860
CAN OFTEN EXCEED IMPLEMENTATION

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:38.995
COSTS SO. I BELIEVE THAT GIVEN

00:51:39.062 --> 00:51:40.764
THE INTEGRAL AND NATURAL ROLE

00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:42.032
OF FIRE ON CALIFORNIA'S

00:51:42.098 --> 00:51:43.567
LANDSCAPES WE REALLY SHOULD BE

00:51:43.633 --> 00:51:45.335
PURSUING SOME KIND OF EXEMPTION

00:51:45.402 --> 00:51:46.903
FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE- THAT WOULD

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:48.939
BETTER STREAMLINE AND MAKE AND

00:51:49.005 --> 00:51:50.373
SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS FOR

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.108
TREATING THESE PROJECTS DONE.

00:51:52.175 --> 00:51:53.577
AND LASTLY I'D LIKE TO MENTION

00:51:53.643 --> 00:51:55.011
AIR QUALITY REGULATIONS IT WAS

00:51:55.078 --> 00:51:55.645
GREAT O HEAR THE LAST

00:51:55.712 --> 00:51:57.948
PRESENTER REALLY GET THAT AIR

00:51:58.014 --> 00:51:58.448
QUALITY PERSPECTIVE ON

00:51:58.515 --> 00:52:01.318
PRESCRIBED FIRE- YOU KNOW ASIDE

00:52:01.384 --> 00:52:02.552
FROM KIND OF THE ATTAINMENT

00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:03.620
PERSPECTIVE I THINK THERE ARE

00:52:03.687 --> 00:52:04.454
SOME REAL ADMINISTRATIVE

00:52:04.521 --> 00:52:05.755
HURDLES TO PRESCRIBED FIRE IN

00:52:05.822 --> 00:52:07.057
CALIFORNIA AROUND THE AIR

00:52:07.123 --> 00:52:08.825
QUALITY PIECE. ONE PROBLEM IS

00:52:08.892 --> 00:52:09.659
THE COST OF AIR QUALITY

00:52:09.726 --> 00:52:11.728
PERMITS. IN THE NORTH COAST

00:52:11.795 --> 00:52:12.696
UNIFIED AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT

00:52:12.762 --> 00:52:14.564
DISTRICT WHERE I WORK A THREE

00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:15.332
HUNDRED ACRE PRESCRIBED BURN

00:52:15.398 --> 00:52:16.967
WOULD COST TWELVE HUNDRED AND

00:52:17.033 --> 00:52:18.468
FIFTY DOLLARS FOR A PERMIT.

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:20.003
PLUS SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR A

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:22.038
SMOKE MANAGEMENT PLAN- THOSE

00:52:22.105 --> 00:52:23.673
COSTS ARE YOU KNOW A DEAL

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:26.076
BREAKER FOR MOST FOLKS ARE

00:52:26.142 --> 00:52:26.576
TRYING TO DO THIS PUBLIC

00:52:26.643 --> 00:52:28.512
BENEFIT WORK. MEANWHILE AIR

00:52:28.578 --> 00:52:29.846
QUALITY PERMITS IN OUR

00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:31.081
NEIGHBORING SISKIYOU COUNTY ARE

00:52:31.147 --> 00:52:33.250
FREE. SO THE COSTA REALLY

00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:34.584
INEQUITABLE ACROSS THE STREET

00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:36.353
ACROSS THE STATE ACROSS THE AIR

00:52:36.419 --> 00:52:38.054
DISTRICTS MAY REPRESENT A MAJOR

00:52:38.121 --> 00:52:39.523
BURDEN FOR LANDOWNERS AND FOR

00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:40.957
AGENCIES ALIKE WHO ARE TRYING

00:52:41.024 --> 00:52:43.026
TO DO THIS GOOD WORK- I REALLY

00:52:43.093 --> 00:52:44.394
THINK THAT. YOU KNOW PUBLIC

00:52:44.461 --> 00:52:46.096
BENEFIT WORK LIKE THIS SHOULD

00:52:46.162 --> 00:52:48.031
NOT COST US A BUNCH OF MONEY. I

00:52:48.098 --> 00:52:48.999
AM IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT SOME

00:52:49.065 --> 00:52:49.766
ERROR DISTRICTS ARE

00:52:49.833 --> 00:52:51.334
UNDERSTAFFED AND OVERWHELMED

00:52:51.401 --> 00:52:52.502
WITH THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT'S

00:52:52.569 --> 00:52:53.436
COMING OUT THEM FROM THE

00:52:53.503 --> 00:52:55.438
PRESCRIBED FIRE SIDE. AND

00:52:55.505 --> 00:52:56.806
THEY'RE UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH

00:52:56.873 --> 00:52:58.341
THE PERMITTING AND THE SMOKE

00:52:58.408 --> 00:52:59.743
MANAGEMENT PLANNING PROCESS IN

00:52:59.809 --> 00:53:03.046
A TIMELY FASHION. PERMIT

00:53:03.113 --> 00:53:03.813
RENEWAL AND SOME A COMMENCEMENT

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.282
IN SOME. TAKE WEEKS MONTHS AND

00:53:05.348 --> 00:53:06.816
REALLY DELAY OUR WORK AND FORCE

00:53:06.883 --> 00:53:08.685
US TO MISS IMPORTANT WINDOWS.

00:53:08.752 --> 00:53:10.287
SO I SEE THESE ADMINISTRATIVE

00:53:10.353 --> 00:53:11.254
CHALLENGES ON THE AIR QUALITY

00:53:11.321 --> 00:53:12.322
SITE IS PRETTY LOW HANGING

00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:14.624
FRUIT. AND SOMETHING WE COULD

00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:15.358
WE COULD ADDRESS AT THE STATE

00:53:15.425 --> 00:53:18.228
LEVEL. SO I GUESS IN CLOSING I

00:53:18.295 --> 00:53:20.363
JUST REALLY LIKE TO APPRECIATE

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:21.631
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO

00:53:21.698 --> 00:53:22.599
SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND I

00:53:22.666 --> 00:53:23.600
REALLY HOPE WE CAN TAKE

00:53:23.667 --> 00:53:25.135
ADVANTAGE OF THIS IMPORTANT

00:53:25.201 --> 00:53:26.469
TIME THAT WE'RE AND- WE HAVE

00:53:26.536 --> 00:53:27.504
SOCIAL LICENSE WE HAVE

00:53:27.571 --> 00:53:29.039
MOMENTUM. WE HAVE COMMUNITY

00:53:29.105 --> 00:53:30.240
EXCITEMENT AROUND PRESCRIBED

00:53:30.307 --> 00:53:32.542
FIRE. AND WE REALLY NEED TO

00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:33.910
HARNESS THAT ENERGY AND DO SOME

00:53:33.977 --> 00:53:35.078
GOOD THINGS TO ENABLE MORE

00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:36.680
WORK. AND I'D REALLY LIKE US TO

00:53:36.746 --> 00:53:38.515
KEEP A FOCUS ON THE TRIBAL

00:53:38.582 --> 00:53:39.849
PEACE AND ON THE COMMUNITY

00:53:39.916 --> 00:53:41.618
PEACE AND- YOU KNOW THESE ARE

00:53:41.685 --> 00:53:42.886
THE REAL STEWARDS OF THE LAND

00:53:42.953 --> 00:53:46.289
LET'S EMPOWER THEM TO HAVE AN

00:53:46.356 --> 00:53:46.856
ACTIVE ROLE. SO THANK YOU SO

00:53:46.923 --> 00:53:48.425
MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO

00:53:48.491 --> 00:53:49.960
WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON NOW TO

00:53:50.026 --> 00:53:52.095
QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE-

00:53:52.162 --> 00:53:54.864
YOU ACTUALLY- ANSWERED MOST OF

00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:56.132
MY QUESTIONS YOU. YOUR

00:53:56.199 --> 00:53:58.268
PRESENTATION WAS VERY VERY

00:53:58.335 --> 00:53:58.902
THOROUGH BUT I WILL ASK YOU IN

00:53:58.969 --> 00:54:01.137
THIS IS- TO MRS QUINN DAVIS

00:54:01.204 --> 00:54:03.239
AND- WHAT DO YOU THINK THE

00:54:03.306 --> 00:54:05.542
BIGGEST BARRIER. IF I CAN GIVE

00:54:05.609 --> 00:54:06.309
YOU WHAT IF YOU CAN JUST TELL

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:07.110
ME WHAT YOU THINK THE BIGGEST

00:54:07.177 --> 00:54:09.846
BARRIER IS TO INTRODUCING MORE-

00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:11.681
PRESCRIBE BURNS IN CALIFORNIA

00:54:11.748 --> 00:54:12.215
YOU MENTIONED A BUNCH OF

00:54:12.282 --> 00:54:13.550
BARRIERS BUT WHAT IF YOU WERE

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:15.452
GONNA SAY YOUR TOP THREE. LIST

00:54:15.518 --> 00:54:20.890
WILL APPOINT A LOT LIKE THE P.

00:54:20.957 --> 00:54:22.792
I MIGHT THREE. WELL DO THINK

00:54:22.859 --> 00:54:23.927
THOSE FIRST TWO IN A REALLY

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:25.795
REALLY IN A REAL WAY I DO THINK

00:54:25.862 --> 00:54:26.963
THAT LIABILITY PIECE AND THOSE

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:29.933
INSURANCE PIECES ARE OUR- TOP

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:30.567
TWO FOR WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE

00:54:30.634 --> 00:54:31.768
IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS FAR AS

00:54:31.835 --> 00:54:33.269
GETTING MORE WORK DONE. AND

00:54:33.336 --> 00:54:34.471
THEN WHAT I ALWAYS SAY IS I

00:54:34.537 --> 00:54:35.905
REALLY DO THINK THAT ONE OF THE

00:54:35.972 --> 00:54:37.340
TOP AREAS WERE DEALING WITH IN

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:38.308
THE WEST AND NOT JUST IN

00:54:38.375 --> 00:54:40.844
CALIFORNIA. IS CULTURAL AND

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:41.778
IT'S AROUND THIS OWNERSHIP

00:54:41.845 --> 00:54:43.880
ISSUE AND- AND KIND OF MAKING

00:54:43.947 --> 00:54:46.049
ROOM FOR- NON FIRE

00:54:46.116 --> 00:54:48.084
PROFESSIONALS HAVE A ROLE IN IN

00:54:48.151 --> 00:54:49.986
PRESCRIBED FIRE AND- TO REALLY

00:54:50.053 --> 00:54:51.321
RECONNECT PEOPLE WITH THEIR

00:54:51.388 --> 00:54:52.589
LANDSCAPE THROUGH THE USE OF

00:54:52.656 --> 00:54:54.124
PRESCRIBED FIRE SO. I THINK WE

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:55.625
NEED TO QUESTION OUR OUR

00:54:55.692 --> 00:54:57.560
CULTURAL NORMS AROUND. HOW WE

00:54:57.627 --> 00:54:59.996
THINK OF. PRESCRIBED FIRE AND

00:55:00.063 --> 00:55:00.630
WHO GETS TO BE INVOLVED IN WHO

00:55:00.697 --> 00:55:02.799
GETS TO LEAD. SO WOULD YOU

00:55:02.866 --> 00:55:03.633
SUGGEST THAT IF YOU'RE GOING

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:06.670
TO. TRY TO INCORPORATE MORE.

00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:08.038
YOU KNOW ORDINARY LANDOWNERS

00:55:08.104 --> 00:55:10.140
LET'S SAY- JUST LANDOWNERS INTO

00:55:10.206 --> 00:55:13.243
THE PROCESS. WOULD YOU THEN-

00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:14.711
ENVY HOW WOULD YOU HOW WOULD

00:55:14.778 --> 00:55:16.413
YOU ENVISION DOING THAT SAFELY.

00:55:16.479 --> 00:55:18.148
WOULD YOU HAVE TO CERTIFY THEM

00:55:18.214 --> 00:55:20.617
SOMEHOW OR TRY USING. THEM

00:55:20.684 --> 00:55:25.355
SORRY NO GO AHEAD GO AHEAD.

00:55:25.422 --> 00:55:27.190
IT'S YEAH IT'S- YOU KNOW I WORK

EDUCATION AND OUTREACH AND

00:55:29.793 --> 00:55:31.628
TRAINING. AND I DO SEE TRAINING

00:55:31.695 --> 00:55:32.929
AS A BIG PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE

00:55:32.996 --> 00:55:34.531
AND IF WE HAVE FUNDING TO

00:55:34.597 --> 00:55:35.699
DIRECT TOWARDS MORE TRAINING I

00:55:35.765 --> 00:55:37.667
THINK THAT'S GREAT WE SAW THAT

00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:38.435
IN THE WIDE IN BILL THAT WAS

00:55:38.501 --> 00:55:40.136
INTRODUCED FEDERALLY-

00:55:40.203 --> 00:55:41.037
PRESCRIBED FIRE TRAINING

00:55:41.104 --> 00:55:43.239
EXCHANGES. WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:55:43.306 --> 00:55:45.075
OPPORTUNITY TO DO MORE TRAINING

00:55:45.141 --> 00:55:46.409
FOR AVERAGE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO

00:55:46.476 --> 00:55:47.410
GET INVOLVED IN THIS AND IT'S

00:55:47.477 --> 00:55:48.712
REALLY ABOUT MAKING SPACE FOR

00:55:48.778 --> 00:55:54.651
THEM AND PROVIDING FUNDING.

00:55:54.718 --> 00:55:58.254
TWELVE SIXTY- I THINK YOU WOULD

00:55:58.321 --> 00:55:59.622
REFER TO THAT BILL IN YOUR

00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:02.659
PRESENTATION I WILL HOW WOULD

00:56:02.726 --> 00:56:04.327
YOU HOW WOULD YOU GET OLD ON

00:56:04.394 --> 00:56:05.261
THAT WHAT WOULD YOU DO NOW TO

00:56:05.328 --> 00:56:07.063
KIND OF. CONTINUE TO WORK IN

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:09.065
THAT BILL IF YOU WERE GOING TO

00:56:09.132 --> 00:56:12.302
INTRODUCE SOMETHING TO- LET'S

00:56:12.368 --> 00:56:14.437
SAY MAKE IT EVE EASIER TO

00:56:14.504 --> 00:56:16.306
PRESCRIBE FIRE LEGISLATIVELY

00:56:16.372 --> 00:56:18.208
BESIDES THE FUNDING PIECE IN

00:56:18.274 --> 00:56:21.978
THE TRAINING PIECE. THE FUNDING

00:56:22.045 --> 00:56:22.612
HE'S IN THE TRAINING. YEAH WELL

00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:23.413
NOT TO SOUND LIKE A BROKEN BUT

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:25.849
I DO THINK THAT THE NEGLIGENCE

00:56:25.915 --> 00:56:27.217
PIECE AND THE INSURANCE PIECE

00:56:27.283 --> 00:56:29.753
ARE THE NATURAL FOLLOW UP TO SB

00:56:29.819 --> 00:56:31.321
TWELVE SIXTY. SB TWELVE SIXTY

00:56:31.387 --> 00:56:32.322
CREATED THE STATE CERTIFIED

00:56:32.388 --> 00:56:33.623
BURN BOSS PROGRAM WHICH IS

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:36.226
HUGELY IMPORTANT AND MONUMENTAL

00:56:36.292 --> 00:56:38.294
REALLY FOR CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S

JUST IN A NUTSHELL. I HOW

00:57:12.061 --> 00:57:14.197
THAT'S WORKING AND HOW YOU

00:57:14.264 --> 00:57:14.764
WOULD NOT MAKE THAT WORK IN

00:57:14.831 --> 00:57:16.699
CALIFORNIA. NO I WOULD AGREE

WITH US ON LINKEDIN ABOUT HOW

00:57:18.368 --> 00:57:20.136
THIS IS BEING SO CRITICAL IN.

00:57:20.203 --> 00:57:21.771
FLORIDA THEIR NEGLIGENCE LONGER

00:57:21.838 --> 00:57:22.672
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN

00:57:22.739 --> 00:57:23.773
OURS AND UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:24.774
A LAWYER SO I CAN'T SPEAK

00:57:24.841 --> 00:57:26.309
EXACTLY WHAT THIS IDEA OF GROSS

00:57:26.376 --> 00:57:29.412
NEGLIGENCE IN FLORIDA. IS IT IS

00:57:29.479 --> 00:57:30.446
THE THRESHOLD THAT MEANS IF YOU

00:57:30.513 --> 00:57:31.581
ACTUALLY. DO YOUR PRESCRIBED

00:57:31.648 --> 00:57:33.216
FIRE YOU CONDUCTED TO THE BEST

00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:34.684
OF YOUR ABILITY EVERYTHING THAT

00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:36.419
YOU'VE DONE IS CORRECT AS BEST

00:57:36.486 --> 00:57:37.387
AS POSSIBLE. YOU HAVE A

00:57:37.453 --> 00:57:39.088
PROBLEM. THEN THE STATE

00:57:39.155 --> 00:57:40.223
ACTUALLY STEPS IN AND THEY

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:42.158
BASICALLY WILL COVER LIABILITY

00:57:42.225 --> 00:57:46.529
WITH SOME PRIVATE INSURANCE. AS

00:57:46.596 --> 00:57:47.897
WELL FROM THE PRESCRIBERS.

00:57:47.964 --> 00:57:49.165
FIRELIGHT POINTED TO TWO. EIGHT

00:57:49.232 --> 00:57:51.067
IT WAS. ON STATE OF FLORIDA

00:57:51.134 --> 00:57:52.569
LAND THAT ACTUALLY WAS DONE BY

00:57:52.635 --> 00:57:53.970
A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR THE

00:57:54.037 --> 00:57:55.839
CONTRACTOR HAD INSURANCE. THAT

00:57:55.905 --> 00:57:57.640
WAS PART OF THE USE OF THE-

00:57:57.707 --> 00:57:58.775
TRYING TO GET THOSE PEOPLE HOLD

00:57:58.842 --> 00:58:00.510
A THIRTY SIX PEOPLE. IT TURNED

00:58:00.577 --> 00:58:01.878
OUT THAT THE HOUSES WERE BURNED

00:58:01.945 --> 00:58:04.080
IN A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY. AND

00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:05.315
THAT TURNED OUT TO BE ANOTHER

00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:06.482
INTERESTING OR SAD ISSUE

00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:07.483
BECAUSE THAT COMMUNITY HADN'T

00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:09.285
HAD AS MUCH. INVESTMENT IN

00:58:09.352 --> 00:58:10.520
TRYING TO MAKE IT MORE FIRE

00:58:10.587 --> 00:58:11.921
WIDER FIRE SAFETY WAS MORE

00:58:11.988 --> 00:58:13.323
VULNERABLE SURE THERE'S AN

00:58:13.389 --> 00:58:15.258
EQUITY ISSUE THERE. SO I WOULD

00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:16.593
SAY THAT. YEAH IDEA OF TRYING

00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:17.727
TO GET SOME SORT OF

00:58:17.794 --> 00:58:19.495
INSTITUTIONAL ABILITY. FOR

00:58:19.562 --> 00:58:21.331
PEOPLE THAT HAVE RELEASED THE

00:58:21.397 --> 00:58:24.734
BACKING OF THE STATE AS LONG AS

00:58:24.801 --> 00:58:25.368
THEY DO THEIR WORK AS THEY SAY.

00:58:25.435 --> 00:58:26.202
THEY DON'TDO SOMETHING

00:58:26.269 --> 00:58:28.037
FOOLISH. OKAY LET ME ASK YOU I

00:58:28.104 --> 00:58:30.139
LIVE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- WE

00:58:30.206 --> 00:58:31.441
HAVE SOME FOR SOME FOREST BUT

00:58:31.507 --> 00:58:32.809
THEY'RE DIFFERENT FARCE THAN

00:58:32.876 --> 00:58:33.843
WHAT WE NORMALLY THINK OF

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:35.712
PRESCRIBED FIRES. HOW WOULD

00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:37.447
THIS WORK OR WOULDN'T WORK AND

00:58:37.513 --> 00:58:39.682
CHAPARRAL AREAS AND IN AREAS

00:58:39.749 --> 00:58:42.485
THAT ARE GRASSLAND AREAS- OR IN

00:58:42.552 --> 00:58:45.889
SOME OF OUR URBAN- WILDLIFE

00:58:45.955 --> 00:58:46.656
AREAS LET'S SAY IN LOS ANGELES

00:58:46.723 --> 00:58:48.458
COUNTY. IS THIS STILL IS

00:58:48.524 --> 00:58:53.496
SOMETHING. WE SHOULD BE

00:58:53.563 --> 00:58:54.097
PURSUING OR HER HOW WOULD LOOK

00:58:54.163 --> 00:58:54.731
DIFFERENT. NO I APPRECIATE THE

00:58:54.797 --> 00:58:55.498
QUESTION BECAUSE YOU'RE UP TO.

00:58:55.565 --> 00:58:56.799
RIGHT CHAPARRAL REALLY IS IT A

00:58:56.866 --> 00:58:58.902
DAY. PLACE IT IS THAT MORE TO.

00:58:58.968 --> 00:58:59.836
BECAUSE IT'S A SYSTEM THAT

00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:01.037
BURKE WITH HIGH SEVERITY HIGH

00:59:01.104 --> 00:59:02.906
POINTS EVERY FEW DECADES OR

00:59:02.972 --> 00:59:05.241
SOMETIMES EVEN EVERY TEN YEARS.

00:59:05.308 --> 00:59:06.276
I THINK HERE YOU GET. YEP BE

00:59:06.342 --> 00:59:07.877
MORE STRATEGIC. YOU KNOW L. A.

00:59:07.944 --> 00:59:09.245
COUNTY FIRE OTHERS VENTURA

00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:10.813
COUNTY FIRE DONE SOME REALLY

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.048
GOOD WORK OF KIND OF. WONDERING

00:59:12.115 --> 00:59:13.950
WHERE IT IN THIS LANDSCAPE OF

00:59:14.017 --> 00:59:15.385
PEOPLE AND VEGETATION AND

00:59:15.451 --> 00:59:17.820
CHAPARRAL- WE DO SOME WORK TO.

00:59:17.887 --> 00:59:18.922
REALLY SET SOMETHING UP TO ONE

00:59:18.988 --> 00:59:20.023
OF FIRE DOES HAPPEN WE CAN USE

00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:21.557
THAT AS AN ANCHOR USE THAT AS A

00:59:21.624 --> 00:59:23.026
WAY TO MAYBE KEEP PEOPLE SAFER.

00:59:23.092 --> 00:59:24.827
SO I WOULD JUST SAY IN THE

00:59:24.894 --> 00:59:26.195
CHAPARRAL AREA YOU'RE GOING TO

00:59:26.262 --> 00:59:27.397
LOOK REALLY STRATEGICALLY

00:59:27.463 --> 00:59:30.066
WORKING WITH SUPPRESSION FOLKS.

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:30.667
AND THEN THREE CONDITIONS SOME

00:59:30.733 --> 00:59:32.001
AREAS THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY

00:59:32.068 --> 00:59:32.902
THINK YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

00:59:32.969 --> 00:59:34.737
BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE IN

00:59:34.804 --> 00:59:35.805
THAT LANDSCAPE. AND IT'S STILL

00:59:35.872 --> 00:59:36.973
SOME OF THE DOES PERTAIN TO

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.008
THAT. BUT IT'S GONNA BE A

00:59:39.075 --> 00:59:39.542
LITTLE BIT MORE NUANCED A

00:59:39.609 --> 00:59:40.743
LITTLE BIT MORE CHALLENGING. SO

00:59:40.810 --> 00:59:42.378
YOU CAN STILL DO THE PRESCRIBED

00:59:42.445 --> 00:59:43.880
BURNS IN THOSE AREAS YOU JUST

00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:49.118
HAVE TO. ALTER HOW YOU DO THEM.

00:59:49.185 --> 00:59:51.854
YOU CAN'T I'VE GOT A- 35% FIRES

00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:53.222
SHOPPERS MICHAEL ONE THING THAT

00:59:53.289 --> 00:59:54.724
TAX. I'M BEEN A FAN AND YOU CAN

00:59:54.791 --> 00:59:56.292
DO THESE AND WHEN. YOU CAN DO

00:59:56.359 --> 00:59:57.627
THE LITERALLY WHENEVER ELSE ON.

00:59:57.694 --> 00:59:58.761
BURNED GRASS IS STILL GREEN

00:59:58.828 --> 01:00:00.763
YOUR BASE. GOT HIGH BUDGETARY.

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:01.531
OF COURSE A LOT OF PLACES

01:00:01.597 --> 01:00:02.665
THOUGHT TO CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW

01:00:02.732 --> 01:00:04.968
OUR- TO FREQUENTLY. SANTA

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:06.336
MONICA. AND OTHER AREAS WHERE

01:00:06.402 --> 01:00:08.171
WE SEEN STRESSED IMPOSED BY

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:09.672
WILDFIRE BURNING TO FREQUENTLY.

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:11.307
SO I THINK IT'S REALLY GOING TO

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:14.243
BE A- COMPLIMENT TO TRY TO.

01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:14.844
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS IS

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:16.913
WITH. ONE OF IMPORTANCE. TO

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.448
ALLOW SUPPRESSION TO ACTUALLY

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:19.882
WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY KEEP

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:21.684
PEOPLE AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE.

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:23.486
THANK YOU IN AUGUST WE SAW SOME

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:25.221
PRETTY INTENSE LIGHTNING STORMS

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.155
AND I'M WONDERING IF THOSE ARE

01:00:26.222 --> 01:00:29.726
GOING TO. KIND OF CONTINUE. IN

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:30.760
SORT OF THIS IS THE SORT OF

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:32.695
ABNORMAL WAY AND WHETHER THAT

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:34.864
CHANGES ANY OF THIS EQUATION.

01:00:34.931 --> 01:00:39.135
OR AND HOW WE PRIORITIZE. THE

01:00:39.202 --> 01:00:40.670
BURNS. KNOW YOUR ACTUAL RIGHT

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:42.372
HERE WE HAD REALLY AND I AND-

01:00:42.438 --> 01:00:43.706
LA. STORM IN AUGUST THIS YEAR

01:00:43.773 --> 01:00:46.342
IT WAS UP. SYSTEM OF KIND OF UP

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:47.777
SUBTROPICAL SYSTEM IN THE

01:00:47.844 --> 01:00:48.845
EQUATOR IT CAME UP TO COME TO

01:00:48.911 --> 01:00:50.646
CAL. PASSED ALONG BY LOW

01:00:50.713 --> 01:00:52.281
PRESSURE SYSTEM. THE BULLS I

01:00:52.348 --> 01:00:53.950
WAS THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA.

01:00:54.017 --> 01:00:55.418
YOU KNOW WE HAVE HAD LIGHTNING-

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:57.754
BUST IN CALIFORNIA. THE LAST

01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.322
THING WE JUNE TWO THOUSAND

01:00:59.389 --> 01:01:00.223
EIGHT THE ONE BEFORE THAT WAS

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:01.824
IN THE LATE SUMMER OF NINETEEN

01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:02.759
EIGHTY SEVEN. WE SEEM TO GET

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:03.793
THEM AT LEAST HAS BEEN LAST

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:06.596
HISTORY EVERY TEN TO FIFTEEN

01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:07.196
TWENTY YEARS OR SO. AND THIS

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:08.464
ONE WAS ONE OF THOSE. ONE OF

01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:10.333
THE GRANDEST. I THINK. WHEN WE

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.567
LOOK AT THE RESEARCH ON

01:01:11.634 --> 01:01:12.935
LIGHTNING WE EXPECT LIGHTNING

01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:14.537
INCIDENTS INCREASE JUST BECAUSE

01:01:14.604 --> 01:01:15.505
OF MORE ENERGY IN THE

01:01:15.571 --> 01:01:17.173
ATMOSPHERE FROM CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.641
SO WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE MORE

01:01:18.708 --> 01:01:20.410
LIGHTNING JUST IN GENERAL. BUT

01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:21.477
I JUST I DON'T THINK WE HAVE

01:01:21.544 --> 01:01:23.246
REALLY WE CAN'T SAY THAT WE

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:24.180
EXPECT TO HAVE MORE OF THESE

01:01:24.247 --> 01:01:25.848
KIND OF STORMS THAT CAME ANAHIT

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:27.884
POSTAL CALIFORNIA SO SEVERELY.

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:28.885
ONE THING I WOULD SAY ABOUT

01:01:28.951 --> 01:01:30.186
THAT STORM IT IT SHOWED YOU THE

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:31.788
VULNERABILITY EVER LANDSCAPES

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:34.157
SANTA CRUZ COUNTY CONTRA COSTA

01:01:34.223 --> 01:01:36.159
COUNTY LAKE COUNTY NAPA COUNTY.

01:01:36.225 --> 01:01:37.727
SIERRA NEVADA IT IS SHOWS JUST

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:39.595
HOW BIG WOULD IF THIS ISSUE IS

01:01:39.662 --> 01:01:40.797
JUST LIKE WHAT WORKS NEED JACK

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:41.764
SAID THAT. IT REALLY IS A

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:43.166
LANDSCAPE GLOBAL PROBLEM THAT

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:44.700
REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.

01:01:44.767 --> 01:01:46.469
BUT I DO THINK THAT WE WILL SEE

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:47.070
MORE LIGHTNING BUT WE'RE

01:01:47.136 --> 01:01:47.937
PROBABLY NOT GOING TO SEE AS

01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:49.839
MANY. YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK

01:01:49.906 --> 01:01:51.140
WE'RE GONNA GET A BUNCH OF. BIG

01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:52.341
LIGHTNING BUS LIKE THE ONE WE

01:01:52.408 --> 01:01:53.543
HAD AUGUST WE'RE GONNA GET HIM

01:01:53.609 --> 01:01:54.610
AGAIN BUT HOPE PLACE FIFTEEN

01:01:54.677 --> 01:01:56.612
YEARS. THANK YOU AND I'M GONNA

01:01:56.679 --> 01:02:07.123
TURN TO DR PRETTY KEY. IF WE.

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.723
CAN GET HER BACK ON THE LINE.

01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:09.625
AND HERE OKAY GREAT. SO I JUST

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:13.396
COUPLE. FOR YOU. YOU DID A

01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:14.030
GREAT JOB OF. THE WILDFIRE.

01:02:14.097 --> 01:02:14.664
POLLUTION THE PRESCRIBED BURN.

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:15.298
I'M WONDERING HOW THAT FIGURES

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:16.532
COMPARED TO JUST OTHER SOURCES

01:02:16.599 --> 01:02:19.602
OF POLLUTION- ARE THEY DWARFED.

01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:22.772
IS THE WILDFIRE. POLLUTION THAT

01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:23.372
WE SAW FOR INSTANCE IS A DWARF

01:02:23.439 --> 01:02:25.108
THE- YOU SHOULD NOT RECEIVE

01:02:25.174 --> 01:02:26.542
FROM HIGHWAYS AND OTHER TYPES

01:02:26.609 --> 01:02:28.478
OF POLLUTION- KIND OF HOW. HOW

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:31.080
DO WE JUDGE THE PRESCRIBED BURN

01:02:31.147 --> 01:02:32.915
POLLUTION AGAINST OTHER.

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:34.383
SOURCES OF POLLUTION IN THE ACT

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:39.422
AND THE ENVIRONMENT. RIGHT SO

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:42.492
TYPICALLY WITH ESPECIALLY THE

01:02:42.558 --> 01:02:43.025
WILD CARDS THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:43.526
SEEING READ. DEBT LEVEL

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.394
POLLUTION MUCH HIGHER OBVIOUSLY

01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:46.696
THAN THE PRESCRIBED BURN AND

01:02:46.762 --> 01:02:48.898
EVEN YOU KNOW SEE. THE LARGER

01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:50.967
LITERATURE THAT WE HAVE ON ON

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:52.702
ON AIR POLLUTION YOU KNOW FROM

01:02:52.768 --> 01:02:54.937
TRAFFIC AND OTHER SOURCES OF

01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:56.405
POLLUTION SO WHICH FAR EXCEEDS

01:02:56.472 --> 01:02:59.075
THAT AND TO THE POINT THAT-

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:01.077
WE'RE ACTIVELY DOING RESEARCH

01:03:01.144 --> 01:03:03.312
IN THAT AREA TO FIND OUT. WITH

01:03:03.379 --> 01:03:05.014
THESE VERY LARGE INCREASES AND

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:06.616
PM TWO POINT FIVE FOR THE

01:03:06.682 --> 01:03:08.484
LONGER DURATION CHILD THAT DOES

01:03:08.551 --> 01:03:10.486
IMPACT HEALTH. WHAT ABOUT THE

01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:12.655
PRESCRIBED. SARS WAS IT WHAT

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:14.290
ABOUT THE PRESCRIBED BURN FIRE

01:03:14.357 --> 01:03:15.391
I ASSUME WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:17.260
MORE DATA A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:03:17.326 --> 01:03:19.562
YEARS OF DOING THAT HOW DOES

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:20.596
THAT COMPARE TO THE- I MEAN I

01:03:20.663 --> 01:03:21.931
WITH THE- THAT WE SAW ON LOS

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:23.065
ANGELES IN THE BAY AREA AND

01:03:23.132 --> 01:03:24.600
SACRAMENTO. IT'S UNLIKE

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:25.668
ANYTHING THAT I'VE SEEN

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:26.269
CERTAINLY FOR THE AMOUNT OF

01:03:26.335 --> 01:03:28.771
TIME- BUT WE'RE TYPICAL

01:03:28.838 --> 01:03:30.106
PRESCRIBER AND I WAS SOON

01:03:30.173 --> 01:03:32.508
WOULDN'T HAVE THAT LEVEL. OF

01:03:32.575 --> 01:03:34.377
INTENSITY SO HOW DOES THAT-

01:03:34.443 --> 01:03:36.512
POLLUTION COMPARED TO JUST YOUR

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:38.648
RUN OF THE MILL POLLUTION.

01:03:38.714 --> 01:03:40.349
RIGHT SO THAT THAT THAT THE

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:41.317
POLLUTION LEVELS ARE MUCH

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:43.452
LOWER- AND CHART MY

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:45.655
UNDERSTANDING IS BECAUSE STATE-

01:03:45.721 --> 01:03:47.390
D. CONDUCTED YOU KNOW THEY LET

01:03:47.456 --> 01:03:48.858
IT BURN SLOWER AND THEY LET

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:50.726
FEET POLLUTION DISSIPATE UP

01:03:50.793 --> 01:03:51.861
INTO THE ATMOSPHERE SO YOU

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:53.362
DON'T GET THAT BIG BUILD UP.

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:55.464
ALL YOU KNOW CLIMATE POLLUTION

01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:57.333
AND THEN BASS IMPACTING THE

01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:00.870
SURROUNDING POPULATION- SO THE

01:04:00.937 --> 01:04:02.939
B. IT MAKES SENSE THAT THEY'RE

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:04.307
SEVERE HEALTH IMPACTS FOR

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:05.875
PRESCRIBED BURNS BECAUSE-

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:07.577
SIMPLY BE. THE AMOUNT OF

01:04:07.643 --> 01:04:09.779
POLLUTION IS SO MUCH LAST- WHAT

01:04:09.845 --> 01:04:11.214
THE LEVEL OF PM TWO POINT FIVE

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.349
IN COMPARISON TO OTHER SOURCES.

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:14.717
THANKS IN GIVEN THAT DO YOU

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:16.152
THINK THAT OUR AIR REGULATORS

01:04:16.219 --> 01:04:17.520
SHOULD BE CHANGING OR RE

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:21.924
EVALUATING. HOW THEY'RE

01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:23.759
REGULATING PRESCRIBED FIRES IN

01:04:23.826 --> 01:04:26.829
MY OPINION YES- BECAUSE-

01:04:26.896 --> 01:04:29.165
THERE'S SO MANY ADVANTAGES. TO

01:04:29.232 --> 01:04:31.968
HAVING THE PRESCRIBED BURNS-

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:33.102
ESPECIALLY WARMER CONSIDERING

01:04:33.169 --> 01:04:37.707
OUR HEALTH- AND BE THE ABILITY

01:04:37.773 --> 01:04:38.341
TO CONTROL THAT AND YOU KNOW IF

01:04:38.407 --> 01:04:39.709
NEED THE MOST POPULATIONS OUT

01:04:39.775 --> 01:04:40.810
OF THE AREA THAT'S REALLY

01:04:40.876 --> 01:04:42.345
NECESSARY TO AVOID SMOKE

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:44.547
EXPOSURE- BUT THE PLANNING

01:04:44.614 --> 01:04:46.082
ABILITY THE PRESCRIBED BURN.

01:04:46.148 --> 01:04:48.584
OUT TO AVOID HEALTH IMPACTS

01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:52.855
SEEMS TO BE- SUCH A HUGE FACTOR.

01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:54.056
MAKING IT MUCH MORE DESIRABLE

01:04:54.123 --> 01:04:56.158
MUCH LESS DETRIMENTAL TO OUR

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:58.194
OVERALL HEALTH. MY LAST

01:04:58.261 --> 01:04:59.495
QUESTION I'LL ASK IT TO WHOEVER

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:01.130
WANTS TO ANSWER THAT GIVEN

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:02.732
THERE'S A FEDERAL WILDFIRE

01:05:02.798 --> 01:05:04.734
PREVENTION BILL OR IF THERE IS

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.002
ONE NEXT YEAR WHAT SHOULD

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:07.570
CALIFORNIA ASKED TO BE IN IT

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:09.605
THAT MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH A

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:15.578
FEDERAL BILL. YOU DON'T HAVE AN

01:05:15.645 --> 01:05:16.479
ANSWER THAT'S OKAY BUT IF

01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:21.617
ANYONE IS COSTS. THIS IS GOT

01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:22.752
MAYBE ALL THIS BILL A MOMENT

01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:24.153
KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORT ON

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:26.222
THE WILD URBAN. AS EIGHT

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:27.757
SEPARATE POINT I THINK THAT'S

01:05:27.823 --> 01:05:29.425
GREAT. SOME BILLS KIND OF

01:05:29.492 --> 01:05:31.394
FOCUSED MORE JUST ON THAT WHILE

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:33.763
OF LIFE ITSELF OTHERS MAY BE ON

01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:34.997
THE WILD LAND I THINK THE ONE

01:05:35.064 --> 01:05:36.565
THING WE REALLY NEED IS WE NEED

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:38.734
BOTH SIDES OF THAT COIN. WE CAN

01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:40.236
WORK ON THE WILD LANDS WE CAN

01:05:40.303 --> 01:05:41.771
DO SOME RESTORATION THERE WOULD

01:05:41.837 --> 01:05:43.439
BE PRESCRIBED BURNING THAT CAN

01:05:43.506 --> 01:05:44.440
REDUCE THE INTENSITY OF FIRE

01:05:44.507 --> 01:05:46.542
THE SPAWNING POTENTIAL WILDFIRE

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:47.877
AND WE CAN ALSO WORK ON THE ONE

01:05:47.943 --> 01:05:48.544
HUNDRED INTERFACE THAT'S

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:49.912
CRUCIAL. GET OUR HUMAN

01:05:49.979 --> 01:05:51.080
COMMUNITIES BETTER PREPARE FOR

01:05:51.147 --> 01:05:52.982
FIRE THAT IS CRUCIAL SO I WOULD

01:05:53.049 --> 01:05:54.684
JUST SAY THE FEINSTEIN BILL

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:55.785
DOES THAT THE FEINSTEIN BILL

01:05:55.851 --> 01:05:57.119
WORKS ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT

01:05:57.186 --> 01:05:58.754
LINE THE WHILE INSIDE. AND ALSO

01:05:58.821 --> 01:06:00.456
ON THE ON THE PRIVATE SIDE SO I

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:05.461
WOULD. ENCOURAGE THAT TYPE OF

01:06:05.528 --> 01:06:07.129
EFFORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

01:06:07.196 --> 01:06:09.198
I'M I HAVE NO OTHER FOR THIS

01:06:09.265 --> 01:06:12.835
PANEL THAT'S AND DOCTOR WOULD.

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:13.869
GREAT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:15.805
CAESAR REALLY REALLY

01:06:15.871 --> 01:06:17.373
INTERESTING AND AN IMPORTANT

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.575
PRESENTATION SO I WANNA SAY I

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.010
APPRECIATE THEM I WANT TO GO

01:06:21.077 --> 01:06:23.479
FIRST TO- DOCTOR PER NICKI A

01:06:23.546 --> 01:06:25.147
QUICK HOPE I SAID THAT RIGHT.

01:06:25.214 --> 01:06:29.552
IF NOT I APOLOGIZE- YOUR- OKAY

01:06:29.618 --> 01:06:30.953
THAT'S WE'RE OFF TO A GOOD

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:33.089
START THAT. YOUR YOUR IN YOUR

01:06:33.155 --> 01:06:34.156
SUMMARY SLIDE WHICH I'M LOOKING

01:06:34.223 --> 01:06:36.158
AT NOW YOU YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:06:36.225 --> 01:06:38.361
YOU KNOW YOUR STUDIES OF THAT

01:06:38.427 --> 01:06:40.463
ART THE SHOW THEIR EXPOSURE

01:06:40.529 --> 01:06:41.063
WILDFIRES MORE DETRIMENTAL TO

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:44.233
HEALTH- THAN A PRESCRIBED BURN

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:48.104
IN CHILDREN- NOW. I ASSUME ALL

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:49.405
RIGHT MAYBE I SHOULD I ACTUALLY

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:50.940
I'M AWARE THAT THERE MAY BE

01:06:51.006 --> 01:06:51.507
SOME OTHER STUDIES THAT ARE

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:54.677
LOOKING AT A PM TWO POINT FIVE

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:58.514
RELEASES. IN THE IN OTHER AREAS

01:06:58.581 --> 01:07:00.416
THAT- AND HOW THAT MIGHT AFFECT

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:02.752
OTHER PEOPLE LIKE LIKE LIKE

01:07:02.818 --> 01:07:03.686
OLDER PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE OR

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:05.755
PEOPLE WHO HAVE- ALREADY

01:07:05.821 --> 01:07:08.791
COMPROMISED- RESPIRATORY

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:12.328
SYSTEMS- IS THAT WHAT WORK

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:15.831
LIKELY ARE YOU AWARE THAT WORK

01:07:15.898 --> 01:07:18.567
IS OUT LIKELY TO SHOW. ANYTHING

01:07:18.634 --> 01:07:19.168
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT

01:07:19.235 --> 01:07:22.271
YOU'RE SEEING IN CHILDREN I AM

01:07:22.338 --> 01:07:25.674
CURIOUS BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF

01:07:25.741 --> 01:07:26.275
A LOT OF OLDER PEOPLE WHO WHO

01:07:26.342 --> 01:07:27.777
MAY HAVE REST PROBLEMS AND THEN

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:28.811
BEING EXPOSED TO THE KIND OF

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:30.079
SMOKE THAT WE'VE BEEN EXPOSED

01:07:30.146 --> 01:07:32.915
TO- THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

01:07:32.982 --> 01:07:35.418
I KNOW IT'S EVEN FOR HEALTHY

01:07:35.484 --> 01:07:35.985
PEOPLE THAT'S NOT NOT A GOOD

01:07:36.051 --> 01:07:39.488
THING. RATES ARE YOU SPEAKING

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:41.323
SPECIFICALLY- MCCARTY

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:43.159
PRESCRIBED BURNS I MEAN I CAN

01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:45.795
TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT- INJECT WITH

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:48.130
SMOKE EXPOSURE MORE MORE THE-

01:07:48.197 --> 01:07:49.799
OLDER POPULATION MORE SMOKE

01:07:49.865 --> 01:07:51.500
EXPOSURE BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:52.101
YOU'VE ALREADY YOU'VE ALREADY

01:07:52.168 --> 01:07:54.837
TOLD US. THAT THE AMOUNT OF

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:56.405
EXPOSURE AND A PRESCRIBED BURN

01:07:56.472 --> 01:07:58.407
VERSUS A REGULAR WILDFIRE IS

01:07:58.474 --> 01:08:00.309
LESS SO. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT

01:08:00.376 --> 01:08:02.344
THE WORK AND CONTROLLED OR THE

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:04.980
OR THE WILDFIRE IF YOU HAVE ANY

01:08:05.047 --> 01:08:06.682
INFORMATION ON THAT. RIGHT YEAH

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:09.618
I CERTAINLY DO SO- SO WE CAN

01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:11.587
TALK ABOUT- THE RESPIRATORY

01:08:11.654 --> 01:08:14.356
IMPACTS- CHILDREN AGES ZERO TO

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:16.492
FOUR BUT THEN THOSE ALSO AGE

01:08:16.559 --> 01:08:17.326
SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER OR MORE

01:08:17.393 --> 01:08:19.428
RISK- WHEN THEY'RE EXPOSED TO

01:08:19.495 --> 01:08:22.731
WILDFIRE SMOKE TO BE SEEN IN

01:08:22.798 --> 01:08:24.033
HOSPITAL FOR RESPIRATORY

01:08:24.099 --> 01:08:26.602
PROBLEMS- IN ADDITION THOSE WHO

01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:28.070
HAVE CHRONIC. WHO ALREADY HAVE

01:08:28.137 --> 01:08:29.271
PRE EXISTING YOU KNOW

01:08:29.338 --> 01:08:31.841
RESPIRATORY ISSUES WILL BE MORE

01:08:31.907 --> 01:08:33.909
AT RISK. D. OUR LITERATURE IS

01:08:33.976 --> 01:08:35.411
ON THE CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:38.047
IMPACT- FROM EXPOSURE WILDFIRE

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:39.682
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE.

01:08:39.748 --> 01:08:42.751
QUITE SHOCKING- THOSE AGE SIXTY

01:08:42.818 --> 01:08:44.053
FIVE AND OLDER OR DECREASED

01:08:44.119 --> 01:08:45.754
RISK FOR HEART ATTACKS FOR A

01:08:45.821 --> 01:08:49.825
READY MEALS. FOR STROKES IN

01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:51.660
ADDITION THERE IS A PAPER THAT

01:08:51.727 --> 01:08:52.261
CAME OUT LAST YEAR THAT SHOWED

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:56.432
THAT EVEN GOING DOWN AT AGE

01:08:56.499 --> 01:08:58.167
THIRTY FIVE AND UP. WHEN THEY

01:08:58.234 --> 01:08:59.668
WHEN A COMMUNITY IS EXPOSED TO

01:08:59.735 --> 01:09:01.103
WILDFIRE SMOKE THERE IS AN

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:03.572
INCREASED RISK FOR SIDE AND-

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:06.208
CARDIAC ARREST- WHICH IS FOR

01:09:06.275 --> 01:09:09.178
SOMEONE JUST. I'M BASICALLY OF

01:09:09.245 --> 01:09:10.813
THE HEART STOPPED AND THEY

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.181
COLLAPSED AND THEY TYPICALLY

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:13.983
DON'T EVEN MAKE IT TO THE

01:09:14.049 --> 01:09:17.920
HOSPITAL- AND SO PRIOR TO- TO

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:20.556
THE STUDY THOSE TYPES OF- SEVEN

01:09:20.623 --> 01:09:23.158
CARDIAC ARREST DEATH. YOU KNOW

01:09:23.225 --> 01:09:25.761
HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN ACCOUNTED

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:30.299
FOR SO. B. B. THE ARE CERTAIN

01:09:30.366 --> 01:09:33.369
MUCH MORE AT RISK- STUDIES HAVE

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:35.404
CLEARLY SHOWN THAT AND THEN

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:36.906
THOSE WITH THE PRE EXISTING YOU

01:09:36.972 --> 01:09:38.274
KNOW RESPIRATORY CARDIAC

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.075
CONDITIONS THERE'S ALSO STUDIES

01:09:40.142 --> 01:09:43.012
COMING OUT SHOWING THAT- DOES

01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:46.048
WITHIN STAGE- RENAL DISEASE-

01:09:46.115 --> 01:09:47.316
HAVE INCREASED DEATH RATES OF

01:09:47.383 --> 01:09:49.418
WILDFIRE SMOKE THEIR STUDIES.

01:09:49.485 --> 01:09:51.754
SHOWING THAT- PREGNANT WOMEN

WITH WITH PRESCRIBED FIRES IS

01:14:11.747 --> 01:14:16.051
THAT CORRECT. WILD I THINK THE

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:18.620
PRIMARY RISK COULD BE TO THE B.

01:14:18.687 --> 01:14:21.290
FIREFIGHTERS DOING THAT

01:14:21.356 --> 01:14:23.458
PRESCRIBED BURNING. BUT IF

THERE IS A POPULATION THAT

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:27.429
COULD BE IMPACTED- CERTAINLY IF

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:28.764
YOU'RE GONNA INHALE SMOKE THERE

01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:33.202

POSSIBLE. SO WHAT WHAT I MEAN I

01:14:52.421 --> 01:14:53.722
MEAN BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WE

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:55.123
CAN AND SHOULD BE DOING MORE

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:56.325
PRESCRIBED FIRES I DON'T WANT

01:14:56.391 --> 01:14:58.293
TO COME OFF AS ANTAGONISTIC.

01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.494
BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE B.

01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:01.763
ARENE EQUITABLE AND PROTECTING

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:03.065
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AS WE'RE

01:15:03.131 --> 01:15:05.033

WE MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS

01:15:11.139 --> 01:15:12.040
TO THESE FILTERS ARE BEING

01:15:12.107 --> 01:15:15.510
MOVED OUT. WHEN WE DO DO THESE

01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:20.215
PRESCRIBED FIRES. I DON'T THINK

01:15:20.282 --> 01:15:20.782
I'M A GOOD ONE TO ANSWER THE

01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:22.084
QUESTION OF WHAT'S CURRENTLY

01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:23.986
BEING DONE WHEN PRESCRIBED

01:15:24.052 --> 01:15:26.321
FIRES OCCUR. BUT YOU KNOW FROM

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:28.590
THE HEALTH LITERATURE WE- WE DO

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:31.226
HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT CAN BE.

01:15:31.293 --> 01:15:33.161
YOU KNOW DONE THAT TO MEDICATE

01:15:33.228 --> 01:15:35.697
ANY CONCERNS- BUT CERTAINLY WE

01:15:35.764 --> 01:15:38.834
DO NOW THAT YOU KNOW- EXPOSURE

01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:41.270
TO WILDFIRE SMOKE IS TYPICALLY

01:15:41.336 --> 01:15:41.837
IN A MUCH GREATER MUCH MORE

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:44.740
DETRIMENTAL- TO THE PRESCRIBED

01:15:44.806 --> 01:15:46.909
BURNING. MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE

01:15:46.975 --> 01:15:49.645
WOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO ANSWER-

01:15:49.711 --> 01:15:52.781
BUT THE CURRENT PRACTICES. WHEN

01:15:52.848 --> 01:15:53.415
A PRESCRIBED BURN IT'S GOING TO

01:15:53.482 --> 01:16:03.759
OCCUR. ANYONE. I'M NOT HEARING

01:16:03.825 --> 01:16:05.260
ANY YEAH I CAN I CAN SPEAK TO

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:07.262
THAT BRIEFLY I THINK I THINK

01:16:07.329 --> 01:16:08.430
IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT

01:16:08.497 --> 01:16:09.531
WE DO GO THROUGH PRETTY

01:16:09.598 --> 01:16:11.566
RIGOROUS SMOKE MANAGEMENT

01:16:11.633 --> 01:16:13.135
PLANNING PROCESS SEES WHEN WE

01:16:13.201 --> 01:16:15.203
PLANNED PRESCRIBED FIRES SO- WE

01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:17.105
REALLY TRY TO TARGET WINDOWS

01:16:17.172 --> 01:16:19.007
WHEN WE GET GOOD DISPERSION ARE

01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:20.943
SMOKELESS AND IS CARRIED AWAY

01:16:21.009 --> 01:16:22.344
AND NOT SETTLING DOWN ON

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:24.846
COMMUNITIES- SO THAT THERE'S A

01:16:24.913 --> 01:16:26.048
LOT OF FOR THOUGHT THAT GOES

01:16:26.114 --> 01:16:28.150
INTO THAT AND WE REALLY HAVE TO

01:16:28.216 --> 01:16:29.952
GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:30.819
IDENTIFYING YOU KNOW THE RIGHT

01:16:30.886 --> 01:16:32.421
CONDITIONS AND THE RIGHT

01:16:32.487 --> 01:16:34.456
WEATHER WINDOWS AND THE RIGHT

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:35.958
WIND DIRECTIONS AND THERE ARE

01:16:36.024 --> 01:16:37.359
SO MANY PIECES THAT WE CONSIDER

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:39.294
SO. WE REALLY JUST TRY TO AVOID

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:40.329
THOSE KINDS OF IMPACTS FROM THE

01:16:40.395 --> 01:16:42.431
START- THAT SAID WE DO HAVE

01:16:42.497 --> 01:16:44.266
TIMES WHEN WE WHEN WE NEED TO

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:45.968
BURN AND IMPACTS ARE GOING TO

01:16:46.034 --> 01:16:47.102
HAPPEN AND THAT'S WHEN

01:16:47.169 --> 01:16:48.770
DEPENDING ON WHO'S DOING THE

01:16:48.837 --> 01:16:51.473
BURN AND WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:52.808
FILTERS OR DO THINGS LIKE THAT

01:16:52.874 --> 01:16:54.142
NOT REALLY IS GOING TO DEPEND

01:16:54.209 --> 01:16:56.011
ON WHAT THE ENTITY IS WHO'S

01:16:56.078 --> 01:16:57.312
DOING IT WHAT COMMUNITY THERE

01:16:57.379 --> 01:16:59.381
AND WHAT KINDS OF SERVICES THEY

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:00.615
PROVIDE SO THAT'S A BIT MORE

01:17:00.682 --> 01:17:01.650
VARIABLE BUT THAT SMOKE

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:03.952
MANAGEMENT PLANNING PIECES IS-

01:17:04.019 --> 01:17:05.487
NOT IS VERY ABLE TO PROCESS

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:08.123
THAT WE ALL GO THROUGH AND PUT

01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:15.464
A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO. STEPHEN

01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:17.499

NOW SO WHEN THEY WANT TO BURN

01:17:28.276 --> 01:17:29.644
IN THE SOUTHERN SIERRA THINGS

01:17:29.711 --> 01:17:30.879
LIKE COMMUNITY CLINICS ARE

01:17:30.946 --> 01:17:32.881
ACTUALLY TOLD ABOUT THIS THEY

01:17:32.948 --> 01:17:33.882
CAN THEN ADVISE THERE ARE FOLKS

01:17:33.949 --> 01:17:35.350
THAT ARE PERHAPS PART OF THE

01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:37.319
PULMONARY AND OTHER ISSUES.

01:17:37.386 --> 01:17:38.620
THIS IS COMING SO THEY'VE

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:40.288
REALLY BUILT THIS COOPERATION

01:17:40.355 --> 01:17:42.758
BETWEEN A PLACE THE SAN JOAQUIN

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:44.092
VALLEY AREA WITH SOME OF THE

01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:45.327
MOST CHALLENGING HERE IN

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:46.828
CALIFORNIA AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:17:46.895 --> 01:17:48.096
WORKING TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:50.265
COOPERATION AND IT IS REAL LIKE

01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:51.566
YOU SAY THAT YOU CAN IMPACT

01:17:51.633 --> 01:17:53.869
PEOPLE BUT I SEE THIS AREA IS

01:17:53.935 --> 01:17:55.037
ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT'S GIVEN

01:17:55.103 --> 01:17:56.505
US GREAT HOPE BECAUSE SOME.

01:17:56.571 --> 01:18:00.742
GROUPS ARE REALLY. WORKING

01:18:00.809 --> 01:18:01.309
TOGETHER TRYING TO LOOK LONG

01:18:01.376 --> 01:18:04.880
TERM. THANK YOU FOR THAT DO WE

01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:09.084
HAVE ANY SORT OF. TRY IN OUR SO

01:18:09.151 --> 01:18:09.918
IF YOU SEE KIND OF A DIFFERENT

01:18:09.985 --> 01:18:12.220
ARE DOING THAT MANY AND THEIR

01:18:12.287 --> 01:18:13.388
PLANS AND HOW MAY BE SOME

01:18:13.455 --> 01:18:14.890
COMMUNITIES MIGHT HAVE BETTER.

01:18:14.956 --> 01:18:16.091
I MIGHT BE DOING THINGS BETTER

01:18:16.158 --> 01:18:17.893
THAN OTHER COMMUNITIES I'VE

01:18:17.959 --> 01:18:20.228
I'VE BEEN. NEAR PRESCRIBED

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:21.863
FIRES WHEN IT'S HAPPENING YOU

01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:23.031
KNOW LET THEM TIME TO KIND OF

01:18:23.098 --> 01:18:23.965
MAKE OTHERS YOU KNOW WHEN WE

01:18:24.032 --> 01:18:24.900
LOOK AT THE MAP AND THERE'S A

01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:25.934
PRESCRIBED FIRE AND I COULD

01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:29.037
FEEL IT- YOU KNOW AND I DIDN'T

01:18:29.104 --> 01:18:30.305
GET THE INFORMATION AND SO

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:31.239
THERE'S DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:32.974
PUBLIC INFORMATION OUT THERE.

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:33.942
DO WE HAVE SOME SORT OF

01:18:34.009 --> 01:18:35.477
PROPERLY KINDA LEARN FROM EACH

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:38.814
OTHER FOR BETTER PRACTICES FOR

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:43.885
THOSE POLITICAL COMMUNITIES.

01:18:43.952 --> 01:18:45.420
THIS IS SCOTT STEVENS AGAIN I

01:18:45.487 --> 01:18:47.022
THINK. THE REALLY IS WORKING

01:18:47.089 --> 01:18:48.256
MORE AND LIKE YOU SAID AT A

01:18:48.323 --> 01:18:49.991
LOCAL COMMUNITY LEVEL MAYBE

01:18:50.058 --> 01:18:51.493
THERE COULD BE A WAY TO. HELP

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.028
FOSTER THAT BUT YOU KNOW. DRUG

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:54.763
COMMUNICATIONS TO CLINICS THAT

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:56.665
BASICALLY SERVES. PEOPLE LOW

01:18:56.731 --> 01:18:58.233
INCOME PEOPLE AND OTHERS THAT.

01:18:58.300 --> 01:18:59.668
MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW THAT

01:18:59.734 --> 01:19:00.302
THIS WORK IS HAPPENING BECAUSE

01:19:00.368 --> 01:19:01.970
ONE. WHEN THIS IS HAPPENING THE

01:19:02.037 --> 01:19:03.438
SAN JOAQUIN I THINK THE AIR

01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:04.873
QUALITY DISTRICT DOWN THERE IS

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:06.575
NOW A GREAT PARTNER. AND A LOOK

01:19:06.641 --> 01:19:07.476
AT THIS IS SOMETHING THEY WANT

01:19:07.542 --> 01:19:08.376
TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IT

01:19:08.443 --> 01:19:10.312
ACTUALLY COOPERATE WITH SO. BUT

01:19:10.378 --> 01:19:11.146
YOU'RE RIGHT PROBABLY IT'S A

01:19:11.213 --> 01:19:12.481
LITTLE BIT MORE AD HOC I WOULD

01:19:12.547 --> 01:19:14.182
IMAGINE SO I DON'T KNOW THAT

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:15.517
SYSTEMIC I'M I'M MAYBE OTHERS

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:23.291
ON THE PANEL COULD SAY. SHE. I

01:19:23.358 --> 01:19:27.596
NOW HAVE. LAST QUITE. THERE'S A

01:19:27.662 --> 01:19:29.197
LOT OF DATA ABOUT. THAT WAS

01:19:29.264 --> 01:19:31.199
PRESENTED TO US ON PM TWO POINT

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:32.067
FIVE FOR THE DISCUSSION AND

01:19:32.134 --> 01:19:33.168
THERE'S A FEW OTHER THINGS ON

01:19:33.235 --> 01:19:34.836
SOME OF THESE FLAGS. THAT WE

01:19:34.903 --> 01:19:36.138
HAVE IN FRONT OF US. ARE WE

01:19:36.204 --> 01:19:37.873
TRACKING OR DO WE HAVE STUDIES

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:40.408
ON GHG EMISSIONS- I MEAN I'M

01:19:40.475 --> 01:19:41.076
GOING TO ASSUME THAT MY

01:19:41.143 --> 01:19:42.477
<u>ILDFIRES HAVE MUCH MORE</u>

01:19:42.544 --> 01:19:44.079
CATASTROPHIC MUCH APPRECIATE

01:19:44.146 --> 01:19:45.914
SHE IS BEING ADMITTED. THAT IT

01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:47.282
MIGHT PRESCRIBE OUR BUT- AS

01:19:47.349 --> 01:19:49.451
WE'RE WORKING ON OUR- REDUCTION

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:51.686
OF GHGS REDDIT. FOR ME IT'S

01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:52.787
MORE LIKE. KNOWING WHAT'S THERE

01:19:52.854 --> 01:19:53.488
SO I KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO

01:19:53.555 --> 01:19:56.491
MITIGATE LATE LATER- YOU KNOW

01:19:56.558 --> 01:19:58.360
AS WE AS WE EMBRACE THIS

01:19:58.426 --> 01:19:59.995
PRACTICE ART DO WE HAVE ANY OF

01:20:00.061 --> 01:20:03.298
THAT THAT'S CURRENTLY GOING ON

01:20:03.365 --> 01:20:20.282
AT THE STATE LEVEL. I MIGHT AND

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:21.383
I MIGHT JUST ADD. SOMETHING IN

01:20:21.449 --> 01:20:23.518
HERE. AS PART OF. WHAT I

01:20:23.585 --> 01:20:25.387
BELIEVE WAS SB NINE A ONE.

01:20:25.453 --> 01:20:27.022
WE'VE ASKED THE AIR RESOURCES

01:20:27.088 --> 01:20:29.057
BOARD TO ACTUALLY MEASURE-

01:20:29.124 --> 01:20:31.593
WILDFIRE EMISSIONS. AND THE

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.828
GHGS ASSOCIATE WITH THAT SO I

01:20:33.895 --> 01:20:35.630
AM ANXIOUSLY AWAITING TO SEE

01:20:35.697 --> 01:20:38.767
pCOMPARES TO OTHER OTHER KINDS

01:20:38.833 --> 01:20:42.137
OF POLLUTION. OUT THERE- BUT- I

01:20:42.204 --> 01:20:43.505
WOULD I WOULD GUESS THAT THESE

01:20:43.572 --> 01:20:45.173
ARE HUGE EMISSIONS I DON'T KNOW

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.341
WHERE THEY FALL ON THE SCALE

01:20:46.408 --> 01:20:48.043
OF. WHAT ELSE IS OMITTED FROM

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:50.478
CARS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT-

01:20:50.545 --> 01:20:52.013
HAVING BREATHED A LOT OF THIS

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.583
FIRM FOR OVER. MONTHS AND YEARS

01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:57.552
NOW- AND SEEING THE EFFECTS OF

01:20:57.619 --> 01:21:00.322
MY COMMUNITY. IT'S NOT POSITIVE

01:21:00.388 --> 01:21:02.457
AND SO. BUT I DO KNOW WE HAVE

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:04.559
ASKED. FOR MEASUREMENTS ON THAT

01:21:04.626 --> 01:21:05.260
AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE GET

01:21:05.327 --> 01:21:06.728
THAT DATA SOON. AND WHAT I

01:21:06.795 --> 01:21:07.963
WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE IS A

01:21:08.029 --> 01:21:09.397
COMPARISON SIDE BY SIDE LIKE

01:21:09.464 --> 01:21:10.999
WHAT YOU'RE- ESSENTIALLY WHAT

01:21:11.066 --> 01:21:11.399
YOU'RE ASKING FOR

01:21:11.466 --> 01:21:13.201
ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA. HOW DOES

01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:14.169
THIS COMPARE TO STATIONARY

01:21:14.236 --> 01:21:15.570
POLLUTION HOUSES COMPARED TO.

01:21:15.637 --> 01:21:17.305
TAILPIPE POLLUTION. AND HOW

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:19.040
DOES YOU KNOW AND HOW DOES THIS

01:21:19.107 --> 01:21:21.009
ALL STACK UP BECAUSE- I JUST

01:21:21.076 --> 01:21:22.043
FEEL LIKE WE'RE NOT INVESTING

01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:23.545
THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO HELP

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:25.113
PREVENT THESE WILD. WILD LARGE

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:27.916
WILDFIRES. AND MY HOPE IS THAT

01:21:27.983 --> 01:21:30.252
THE- THAT MAY PUT MY HOPE IS

01:21:30.318 --> 01:21:31.820
I'M WRONG BUT I BY MY INSTINCT

01:21:31.886 --> 01:21:33.989
IS THAT I'M NOT. AND WE NEED TO

01:21:34.055 --> 01:21:36.157
BE PUTTING A LOT MORE RESOURCES

01:21:36.224 --> 01:21:38.994
INTO THIS. WOULD ALSO SAY THAT-

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:39.561
BECAUSE PRESCRIBED BURNS ARE

01:21:39.628 --> 01:21:46.134
DONE. A LOT OF TIMES BASED.

01:21:46.201 --> 01:21:47.869
THE RIGHT WINDOWS. AFTER THERE

01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:50.338
HAS BEEN POTENTIALLY RAIN- IN

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:51.906
AN AREA TO HELP SLOW THESE

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:54.409
FIRES DOWN- THE EMISSIONS ARE

01:21:54.476 --> 01:21:57.012
GOING TO BE LOWER- THESE

01:21:57.078 --> 01:21:59.914
UNCONTROLLED FIRES- LIKE WE HAD

01:21:59.981 --> 01:22:01.383
IN FROM THE LIGHTNING COMPLEX.

01:22:01.449 --> 01:22:02.784
WHERE THEY WERE LARGE INVERSION

01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:04.953
LAYERS THAT LITERALLY SAT THIS

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:07.522
SMOKE DOWN IN DID NOT ALLOW IT

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:09.324
TO GO ANYWHERE. NOW FOR DAYS

01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:11.559
AND DAYS UPON END WHERE THE SKY

01:22:11.626 --> 01:22:14.362
WAS RED AND WE- IT LOOKS ORANGE

01:22:14.429 --> 01:22:18.933
FOR DAYS- HAS TO HAVE. A MUCH

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:19.934
DIFFERENT DIFFERENT. THEIR AND

01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:22.137
SO. THAT THESE UNCONTROLLED

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:24.239
FIRES ARE HAPPENING AT TIMES

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:25.173
WHEN THE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:26.841
NOT FAVORABLE WORSE PRESCRIBED

01:22:26.908 --> 01:22:28.643
BURNS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN. BY

01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:30.312
OUR OWN REGULATION IN TIMES

01:22:30.378 --> 01:22:31.513
WHEN THE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE

01:22:31.579 --> 01:22:35.216
FAVORABLE SO I THINK THAT THE

01:22:35.283 --> 01:22:35.817
OFFSET FOR THAT IS GOING TO BE

01:22:35.884 --> 01:22:37.819
DIFFERENT. YEAH I MEAN I WOULD

01:22:37.886 --> 01:22:40.755
SAY THAT I EIGHT OF THE SAME

01:22:40.822 --> 01:22:42.757
MINDSET THAT THESE A WILDFIRE

01:22:42.824 --> 01:22:44.926
EMISSIONS ARE WAY WORSE. THAN

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:46.661
THE PRESCRIBED FIRES- I WOULD

01:22:46.728 --> 01:22:49.964
JUST. ONE DAY WE WERE TRACKING

01:22:50.031 --> 01:22:51.866
IT AND AS WITHIN THE COMPARISON

01:22:51.933 --> 01:22:53.435
THEY WERE INCLUDING BUT THE

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:56.304
COMPARISON OF PRESCRIBED FIRES.

01:22:56.371 --> 01:22:58.206
WILDFIRES STATIONARY SOURCES SO

01:22:58.273 --> 01:22:59.541
FOR THE BUT ALSO THAT I THINK

01:22:59.607 --> 01:23:01.710
IN THAT MAKING SURE WE HAVE.

01:23:01.776 --> 01:23:03.111
PROPER I COUNTIES WITH THAT

01:23:03.178 --> 01:23:04.179
HAVE PROPER OFFSET TO

01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:06.881
MITIGATION FOR THEM I THINK FOR

01:23:06.948 --> 01:23:08.149
ME IT'S MORE WE'RE GOING TO DO

01:23:08.216 --> 01:23:09.918
THIS AND I BELIEVE WE NEED TO

01:23:09.984 --> 01:23:12.053
BE DOING MORE OF THIS AND AS

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.222
FAR AWAY. YEAH WHAT ARE SOME OF

01:23:14.289 --> 01:23:15.623
THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES SO WE

01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:17.592
COULD ALSO MITIGATE FOR THAT

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:19.127
AND THINK AHEAD FOR THAT. I

01:23:19.194 --> 01:23:22.330
WOULD JUST SAY THAT I

01:23:22.397 --> 01:23:22.931
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU. MY

01:23:22.997 --> 01:23:24.833
CONCERN WE WANTED THIS DATA BUT

01:23:24.899 --> 01:23:26.768
WE HAD TO LEGISLATIVE THE ASK

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:28.703
FOR IT- THIS DATA SHOULD BE

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:29.671
AVAILABLE NOW FROM MY

01:23:29.738 --> 01:23:31.306
PERSPECTIVE THESE FIRES BEEN

01:23:31.373 --> 01:23:33.341
GOING ON FOR YEARS. WE HAD TO

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:37.379
PUSH OUR OWN AGENCIES TO HELP

01:23:37.445 --> 01:23:37.912
PRODUCES DATA AND I THINK

01:23:37.979 --> 01:23:42.217
THAT'S A PROBLEM. ANYTHING ELSE

01:23:42.283 --> 01:23:44.853
MISS GARCIA NO THANK YOU OKAY

01:23:44.919 --> 01:23:46.054

HAVE QUESTIONS WHEN HE RETURNED

01:24:00.135 --> 01:24:01.870

THAT TAKE US- WE TRULY ARE-

01:25:41.269 --> 01:25:43.605
SEEING THINGS DIFFERENTLY THAN

01:25:43.671 --> 01:25:46.875
WE HAVE IN MY CAREER AND MY

01:25:46.941 --> 01:25:48.743
CAREER IS THIRTY YEARS AS A

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:53.314
FORESTER- AND FIREWORKS- FIRE

01:25:53.381 --> 01:25:57.986
FIGHTERS. WHAT WHAT IS CLEAR IS

01:25:58.052 --> 01:25:59.220
THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING

01:25:59.287 --> 01:26:00.688
ABOUT AND THINGS THAT WE'VE

01:26:00.755 --> 01:26:03.958
BEEN TRYING TO REALLY FURTHER

01:26:04.025 --> 01:26:06.160
HAS- THE FORESTRY AND FIRE

01:26:06.227 --> 01:26:08.763
COMMUNITY IS THIS ALLOF THE

01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:10.131
ABOVE APPROACH THERE IS NO

01:26:10.198 --> 01:26:11.733
SILVER BULLET TO WHAT WE'RE

01:26:11.799 --> 01:26:14.702
LOOKING AT. AND WHILE- WHILST

01:26:14.769 --> 01:26:17.138
WILL FOCUS ON I WILL FOCUS ON A

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:19.974
PRESCRIBED FIRE- I WOULD LIKE I

01:26:20.041 --> 01:26:22.977
CAN'T LET IT GO UNNOTICED OR

01:26:23.044 --> 01:26:25.480
RUN STATED. THAT THERE ARE

01:26:25.547 --> 01:26:27.949
SEVERAL DIFFERENT. ISSUES THAT

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:29.551
WE NEED TO DEAL WITH WHEN

01:26:29.617 --> 01:26:32.887
TALKING ABOUT- FOREST HEALTH

01:26:32.954 --> 01:26:35.356
AND REDUCTION OF. RISK TO

01:26:35.423 --> 01:26:38.293
COMMUNITIES FROM WILDFIRE THAT

01:26:38.359 --> 01:26:41.095
INCLUDES. THAT ALL OF HE ABOVE

01:26:41.162 --> 01:26:44.432
APPROACH WE TRULY- IN SOME

01:26:44.499 --> 01:26:46.267
AREAS WELL WE NEED TO PUT MORE

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:47.702
FIRE ON THE GROUNDS ARE

01:26:47.769 --> 01:26:50.171
PRESCRIBED FIRE- WE CAN'T DO

01:26:50.238 --> 01:26:51.706
THAT SAFELY AT THIS POINT IN

01:26:51.773 --> 01:26:54.742
TIME WE REALLY NEED TO DO-

01:26:54.809 --> 01:26:56.377
OTHER FUEL REDUCTION PROJECT

01:26:56.444 --> 01:26:58.813
WORK IN ORDER TO MAKE FOR A

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:01.983
SAFE. A REINTRODUCTION FOR FIRE

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:04.252
ON THE LANDSCAPE AS THAT

01:27:04.319 --> 01:27:06.888
HAPPENS- TIME WILL WILL PASS

01:27:06.955 --> 01:27:08.556
AND WILL HAVE A LANDSCAPE THAT

01:27:08.623 --> 01:27:11.426
CAN RECEIVE FIRE ON AN ANNUAL

01:27:11.492 --> 01:27:14.262
BASIS AS NEEDED- ON A RETURN

01:27:14.329 --> 01:27:17.131
INTERVAL OF TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY

01:27:17.198 --> 01:27:18.733
YEARS WHATEVER IT NEEDS TO BE-

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:20.602
WITHOUT ALL OF THAT ADDITIONAL

01:27:20.668 --> 01:27:23.438
WORK BUT RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO

01:27:23.504 --> 01:27:25.440
ALSO INVEST IN THOSE THINGS-

01:27:25.506 --> 01:27:26.975
THAT WILL MAKE IT SAFE TO PUT

01:27:27.041 --> 01:27:32.146
FIRE ON THE GROUND. TO THE

01:27:32.213 --> 01:27:33.881
SCALE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO.

01:27:33.948 --> 01:27:34.916
WE CAN'T FOR THAT OUR

01:27:34.983 --> 01:27:37.185
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STILL.

01:27:37.251 --> 01:27:39.887
ACROSS THE STATE IN SOME CASES

01:27:39.954 --> 01:27:42.357
ARE NOT- THE PLACE WHERE WE

01:27:42.423 --> 01:27:44.759
WANT TO PUT PRESCRIBED FIRE-

01:27:44.826 --> 01:27:45.927
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS IN SOME

01:27:45.994 --> 01:27:48.363
CASES THE WAY THE TOPOGRAPHY

01:27:48.429 --> 01:27:51.766
IS. OR THE WAY THE FUELS ARE

01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:54.736
AND WE NEED TO DO OTHER TYPES

01:27:54.802 --> 01:27:57.472
OF FUEL PROJECTS IN A HIM.

01:27:57.538 --> 01:27:59.507
MAINTAIN DEFENSIBLE SPACE-

01:27:59.574 --> 01:28:03.611
MAINTAIN. THE AND THE- AREAS

01:28:03.678 --> 01:28:07.382
AROUND HOMES AND- DO THE- HOME

01:28:07.448 --> 01:28:09.183
HARDENING THAT IS NECESSARY TO

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:12.620
ENSURE THAT HOMES ARE.

01:28:12.687 --> 01:28:14.956
RESISTANT TO HAMBURGERS. SO WE

01:28:15.023 --> 01:28:16.991
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS

01:28:17.058 --> 01:28:18.126
AND THE SZE AND TYPE OF

01:28:18.192 --> 01:28:19.794
MEMBERS COMING IN BY REDUCING

01:28:19.861 --> 01:28:20.862
THE FUELS OUTSIDE OF THE

01:28:20.928 --> 01:28:22.130
COMMUNITY WE HARDENED

01:28:22.196 --> 01:28:23.665
STRUCTURES WE HAVE THE

01:28:23.731 --> 01:28:25.266
DISPENSABLE SPACE. WE HAVE A

01:28:25.333 --> 01:28:28.503
SYSTEMATIC APPROACH THAT TRULY

01:28:28.569 --> 01:28:30.171
REDUCES THE RISK OF WILDFIRE

01:28:30.238 --> 01:28:33.508
CONSUMING HOMES AND- GOD FOR

01:28:33.574 --> 01:28:36.744
BID WHOLE COMMUNITIES. SO

01:28:36.811 --> 01:28:41.416
PRESCRIBED. THIS IS THE FUTURE

01:28:41.482 --> 01:28:45.553
PRESCRIBED FIRE IS. BY FAR THE

01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:48.523
MOST ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE WAY

01:28:48.589 --> 01:28:50.425
TO TREAT THE LANDSCAPE THAT WE

01:28:50.491 --> 01:28:53.728
NEED TO IN ORDER TO RETURN TO A

01:28:53.795 --> 01:28:57.165
HEALTHY. ECOSYSTEM IN SOME

01:28:57.231 --> 01:29:00.134
CASES BUT ALSO HEALTHY RETURN

01:29:00.201 --> 01:29:02.670
RATE OF WILDFIRE ON THE

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:04.505
LANDSCAPE OR JUST BUYER ON THE

01:29:04.572 --> 01:29:07.575
LANDSCAPE- TO REDUCE THOSE

01:29:07.642 --> 01:29:08.910
RISKS THAT I MENTIONED

01:29:08.976 --> 01:29:12.313
PREVIOUSLY. SO IN THE IN THE

01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:15.083
CALIFORNIA FOREST EFFORT SORRY

01:29:15.149 --> 01:29:17.018
CALIFORNIA FIRE. CALIFORNIA

01:29:17.085 --> 01:29:19.053
CARBON PLAN EXCUSE ME THERE'S

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:21.155
SO MANY PLANS BUT THE CARBON

01:29:21.222 --> 01:29:24.325
PLAN IS SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT

01:29:24.392 --> 01:29:27.061
HOW DO WE- IN OUR FORESTED

01:29:27.128 --> 01:29:30.098
ECOSYSTEMS INCREASES THE

01:29:30.164 --> 01:29:33.101
SEQUESTRATION OF CARBON. REDUCE

01:29:33.167 --> 01:29:38.606
OUR OUR- OUR EFFECTS ON THE

01:29:38.673 --> 01:29:41.776
LAND ARE ON THE AIR AND HANDY

01:29:41.843 --> 01:29:44.979
ON THE ON CLIMATE CHANGE ITSELF.

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:46.781
AND SO ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO

01:29:46.848 --> 01:29:48.616
DO THAT IS IT IS INVEST IN

01:29:48.683 --> 01:29:50.918
THINGS THAT WILL SEQUESTERING

01:29:50.985 --> 01:29:54.956
CARBON TREES FOREST SOILS SOILS

01:29:55.022 --> 01:29:58.693
IN GENERAL- AND VEGETATION ARE

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.728
ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE WAYS

01:30:00.795 --> 01:30:03.765
TO DO SUCH. AND SO THROUGH

01:30:03.831 --> 01:30:05.767
THIS- WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT WE

01:30:05.833 --> 01:30:10.238
NEED TO DO ROUGHLY. FIVE

01:30:10.304 --> 01:30:11.539
HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES ANNUALLY

01:30:11.606 --> 01:30:13.641
OF TREATMENT IN FORESTED

01:30:13.708 --> 01:30:15.309
ECOSYSTEMS BUT THAT INCLUDES

01:30:15.376 --> 01:30:19.313
CHAPARRAL. OAK WOODLAND- DEEP

01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:21.149
DENSE FOREST IN THE HIGHER

01:30:21.215 --> 01:30:22.316
ELEVATIONS AS WELL AS THE

01:30:22.383 --> 01:30:23.785
MEXICANA FOR IN THE MIDDLE AT

01:30:23.851 --> 01:30:26.788
ELEVATIONS ALL OF THAT AREA

01:30:26.854 --> 01:30:29.257
NEEDS SOME LEVEL OF FOREST

01:30:29.323 --> 01:30:30.958
HEALTH TREATMENT WHAT THAT'LL

01:30:31.025 --> 01:30:32.126
DO IS IT'LL INCREASE THE HEALTH

01:30:32.193 --> 01:30:34.195
OF THE OF THE VEGETATION THAT

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:36.197
REMAINS ON THE LANDSCAPE

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:39.000
PARTICULARLY THOSE LARGE TREES.

01:30:39.066 --> 01:30:40.568
AND THEY WILL SEE PLASTER

01:30:40.635 --> 01:30:46.040
CARBON FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

01:30:46.107 --> 01:30:46.641
INTO THE FUTURE IF WE DO THIS

01:30:46.707 --> 01:30:47.708
RIGHT. SO WHAT WE'RE ALSO

01:30:47.775 --> 01:30:49.510
WORKING WITH IS THE FOR SERVICE

01:30:49.577 --> 01:30:51.012
US FOREST SERVICE AND THE OTHER

01:30:51.078 --> 01:30:54.849
FEDERAL AGENCIES HAVE COMMITTED

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:55.449
TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES

01:30:55.516 --> 01:30:59.487
AS WELL. AND BY THE BY TWENTY

01:30:59.554 --> 01:31:00.121
TWENTY THREE OUR INTENT IS TO

01:31:00.188 --> 01:31:03.090
HAVE BOTH OF THOSE SETS OF FIVE

01:31:03.157 --> 01:31:03.558
HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE

01:31:03.624 --> 01:31:05.493
TREATMENTS GOING ON ON THE

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:09.197
LANDSCAPE ANNUALLY- AND- HALF

01:31:09.263 --> 01:31:10.565
OF THAT ON FEDERAL LANDS HALF

01:31:10.631 --> 01:31:12.300
OF THAT ON THE STATE AND

01:31:12.366 --> 01:31:17.538
PRIVATE LANDS. SO AS I

01:31:17.605 --> 01:31:20.508
MENTIONED MANY MANY TECHNIQUES

01:31:20.575 --> 01:31:23.544
ARE OUT THERE FOR. THE USE OF

01:31:23.611 --> 01:31:27.181
FUEL REDUCTION- TO REALLY GET

01:31:27.248 --> 01:31:29.116
US TO A BETTER PLACE- THE IN

01:31:29.183 --> 01:31:33.788
OUR OUR ABILITY TO- ALLOW FIRE

01:31:33.855 --> 01:31:36.357
TO BE UTILIZED ON THE

01:31:36.424 --> 01:31:39.961
LANDSCAPE. THE FIRST THAT WE

01:31:40.027 --> 01:31:43.297
USE AND SO OTHERS HAVE TALKED

01:31:43.364 --> 01:31:46.767
ABOUT THE SEQUEL COMPONENTS THE

01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:50.204
SMOKE MANAGEMENT PLANNING- AND

01:31:50.271 --> 01:31:52.006
DOWNED WHAT I'M GONNA TALK

01:31:52.073 --> 01:31:54.208
ABOUT HERE IS EVERY SINGLE

01:31:54.275 --> 01:31:56.711
PRODUCT PROJECT THAT WE DO FOR

01:31:56.777 --> 01:32:01.816
PRESCRIBED BURNING REQUIRES A-

01:32:01.883 --> 01:32:05.953
VERY DETAILED PLAN AND YES I.

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:07.922
MEMBER WOULD AYE HI HI I AGREE

01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:10.358
IN IN SOME CASES IT IS A

01:32:10.424 --> 01:32:12.793
LABORIOUS AND EXPENSIVE PROCESS

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:14.996
IN ORDER TO PUT THAT PLAN

01:32:15.062 --> 01:32:17.965
TOGETHER- AND- WHAT WE NEED TO

01:32:18.032 --> 01:32:21.369
BE SURE TO- REFERENCE THOUGH IS

01:32:21.435 --> 01:32:24.038
THE VALUE OF PROTECTING THE-

01:32:24.105 --> 01:32:26.140
THE RESOURCES THAT ARE ON THE

01:32:26.207 --> 01:32:28.042
LANDSCAPE. SOMETIMES THOSE ARE

01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:30.478
CULTURAL SOMETIMES THEY ARE

01:32:30.544 --> 01:32:32.647
VEGETATION SOMETIME MEETING

01:32:32.713 --> 01:32:34.949
RARE PLANTS- THAT I HAVE SEEN

01:32:35.016 --> 01:32:37.118
TOO MUCH FIRE SOMETIMES THEY

01:32:37.184 --> 01:32:41.589
ARE MIGRATORY BIRDS OR OTHER-

01:32:41.656 --> 01:32:43.157
SLOWER AND FULLER I MEAN FANA

01:32:43.224 --> 01:32:46.227
THAT MAY BE SENSITIVE TO- THE

01:32:46.294 --> 01:32:48.796
FIRE OUR PRESCRIPTION. NEEDS TO

01:32:48.863 --> 01:32:50.998
ADDRESS THOSE THINGS AND NEEDS

01:32:51.065 --> 01:32:53.267
TO PROTECT THOSE THINGS. ARE

01:32:53.334 --> 01:32:55.069
PROTECT THOSE NATURAL RESOURCES

01:32:55.136 --> 01:32:57.271
ON THE LANDSCAPE AND SO OR

01:32:57.338 --> 01:32:59.073
SOMETIMES IT TAKES A LONG TIME

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:02.343
BUT AS TIME GOES ON AND WE GET

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:04.478
TO AREAS WHERE WE BURNED OVER

01:33:04.545 --> 01:33:07.615
TIME I KNOW I WILL BE ABLE TO

01:33:07.682 --> 01:33:09.750
TAILOR OUR PRESCRIPTIONS MORE

01:33:09.817 --> 01:33:13.187
QUICKLY AND MORE READILY TO

01:33:13.254 --> 01:33:14.121
THOSE RESOURCES THAT ARE ON THE

01:33:14.188 --> 01:33:15.723
LANDSCAPE. WHERE WE'RE COMING

01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:17.725
FROM A PLACE WHERE WE REALLY

01:33:17.792 --> 01:33:22.196
DID NOT EMBRACE PRESCRIBED FIRE

01:33:22.263 --> 01:33:22.897
FOR THE LAST. WELL IN THE LAST

01:33:22.964 --> 01:33:25.166
YEARS WE HAVE. PRIOR TO THAT

01:33:25.232 --> 01:33:26.867
THERE WAS ABOUT TWENTY TO

01:33:26.934 --> 01:33:28.135
THIRTY YEARS WHERE IT WAS JUST

01:33:28.202 --> 01:33:29.637
SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE DOWN OF A

01:33:29.704 --> 01:33:32.239
DECLINE AS A TOOL OF USE. WE

01:33:32.306 --> 01:33:36.110
ARE. BUILDING THAT BACK. AND

PRESCRIPTIONS THAT OPEN THE

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:36.270
WINDOW TO BE ABLE TO BURN AT

01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:37.471

CALGARY TP. WHAT I HAVE NO

01:45:24.618 --> 01:45:26.586

MOVE TO QUESTIONS NOW I HAVE

01:45:29.856 --> 01:45:31.224
SOME QUESTIONS TO BEGIN FOR

01:45:31.291 --> 01:45:35.796
REPORTER. I'M SORRY TO MAKE YOU

01:45:35.862 --> 01:45:38.065

TOO LATE. HI CHIEF THANK YOU.

01:45:44.638 --> 01:45:47.340
MY FIRST QUESTION FOR YOU IS

01:45:47.407 --> 01:45:49.209
WHETHER CAL FIRE HAS A GOAL FOR

01:45:49.276 --> 01:45:51.144
THE NUMBER OF BURN BOSSES YOU

01:45:51.211 --> 01:45:54.047
WANT TO CERTIFY AND HOW DO YOU

01:45:54.114 --> 01:45:54.614
WHAT IS THAT GOAL AND HOW DO

01:45:54.681 --> 01:45:57.484
YOU INTEND TO GET THERE. WE

01:45:57.551 --> 01:45:59.686
HAVE NOT SET A GOAL FOR NUMBER

01:45:59.753 --> 01:46:02.055
OF BURNT BOSSES I THINK WHAT WE

01:46:02.122 --> 01:46:05.158
WANT TO DO IS. EXPAND AND AN

01:46:05.225 --> 01:46:09.296

AREAS OF THE STATE AS WELL- I

01:46:13.734 --> 01:46:15.635
THINK. SOME AREAS OF THE STATE

01:46:15.702 --> 01:46:17.104
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MUCH BETTER

01:46:17.170 --> 01:46:20.807

ARE EIGHT DEDICATED CRUISE

01:50:00.994 --> 01:50:02.896
TOWARDS THAT ARE OUT I THINK

01:50:02.963 --> 01:50:03.897
THEY'RE EIGHT CREWS THEY'RE

01:50:03.964 --> 01:50:05.332
SUPPOSED THE WORKING ON FIRE

PREVENTION PROJECTS. YEAR

01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:10.937
ROUND. CONSIDERING THE BACKLOG

01:50:11.004 --> 01:50:12.739
OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

01:50:12.806 --> 01:50:14.607
IS THERE GOING TO BE A MOVE TO

01:50:14.674 --> 01:50:15.909
EXPAND THE NUMBER OF THOSE

01:50:15.976 --> 01:50:18.511
CREWS AND- AND THE DISPERSION

01:50:18.578 --> 01:50:20.013
OF THEM. I DO UNDERSTAND I

01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:22.849
HEARD. A TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE

01:50:22.916 --> 01:50:25.085
BUT I HEARD THAT. THOSE SOME OF

01:50:25.151 --> 01:50:26.686
THOSE CREWS WERE ACTUALLY DEAD

01:50:26.753 --> 01:50:28.254
YOU KNOW PULLED OFF THEIR-

01:50:28.321 --> 01:50:30.223
THEIR PREVENTION WORKED

01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:30.957

01:50:31.024 --> 01:50:33.660
YEAR. MAYBE I'D MAYBE HURTING

01:50:33.727 --> 01:50:35.362
CORRECTLY BUT I BY WAS AN

01:50:35.428 --> 01:50:37.263
IMPRESSION THOSE ARE GONNA BE

DEDICATED YEAR ROUND CRUISE.

01:50:39.466 --> 01:50:40.667
ONCE AGAIN I RECOGNIZE THIS WAS

01:50:40.734 --> 01:50:43.503
AN UNPRECEDENTED YEAR. BUT IT'S

01:50:43.570 --> 01:50:45.271
CLEAR THAT EVEN A PRESCRIBED

01:50:45.338 --> 01:50:46.506
BURNS THAT I'VE SEEN THAT ARE

01:50:46.573 --> 01:50:48.708
BEING SET UP THERE'S A LOT OF

01:50:48.775 --> 01:50:49.376
VEGETATION WORK THAT GOES INTO

01:50:49.442 --> 01:50:51.344
DOING THOSE BEFORE THEY CAN

01:50:51.411 --> 01:50:53.780
ACTUALLY DO THE BURN. SO I'M

01:50:53.847 --> 01:50:55.482
BIG ON PREVENTION DOLLAR

TOWARDS PREVENTION- AND THREE

01:51:09.496 --> 01:51:11.664
SPECIFICALLY AROUND SOME OF

01:51:11.731 --> 01:51:12.232
THESE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

01:51:12.298 --> 01:51:15.835
PROJECTS. WELL REMEMBER WHAT

01:51:15.902 --> 01:51:20.407
THAT IS- ABSOLUTELY- A- SPOT ON

01:51:20.473 --> 01:51:22.308
QUESTION FOR WHERE WE ARE IN

01:51:22.375 --> 01:51:22.976
INCOME YEAH A COUPLE OF

01:51:23.043 --> 01:51:26.246
DIFFERENT WAYS- THE IT'S TEN

01:51:26.312 --> 01:51:28.681
ACTUALLY- FUELS DEDICATED FUELS

01:51:28.748 --> 01:51:31.718

DID PUT THOSE FIREFIGHTERS ON-

01:51:41.728 --> 01:51:44.397
THE- THE SHORTAGE OF RESOURCES

01:51:44.464 --> 01:51:47.567
ON THE AMOUNT OF FIRE THAT WAS-BURNING ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE.

01:51:47.634 --> 01:51:48.802
WE BROUGHT THEM BACK OFF OF

01:51:48.868 --> 01:51:50.837
THOSE ASSIGNMENTS AS SOON AS WE

01:51:50.904 --> 01:51:53.006
COULD THEY WENT BACK TO- DOING

01:51:53.073 --> 01:51:55.975
FUELS PROJECT WORK AND JUST FOR

01:51:56.042 --> 01:51:58.478

THE WHEN THE LIGHTNING HAPPENS.

01:52:06.252 --> 01:52:08.455
AND THEN IN SEPTEMBER WE

01:52:08.521 --> 01:52:09.823
ACTUALLY WERE ABLE WE FOUND A

01:52:09.889 --> 01:52:12.192
COUPLE OF OPPORTUNITIES TO- DO

01:52:12.258 --> 01:52:13.760
SOME OF CLEAN UP BURNING THAT

01:52:13.827 --> 01:52:15.095

BURNING AS WE SPEAK- AND THOSE

01:52:19.666 --> 01:52:21.568
CREWS WERE CRITICAL TO BEING

01:52:21.634 --> 01:52:23.770
ABLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN- WHAT

01:52:23.837 --> 01:52:25.872
THE BIGGER PICTURE A IS AND I

INMATE CREWS THAT WE HAVE. IS

01:52:33.246 --> 01:52:35.148

01:52:35.215 --> 01:52:37.617
THIS EXPANSION YES WE WANT TO

01:52:37.684 --> 01:52:40.153
EXPAND OUR FUELS GROUP PROGRAM-

01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:42.188
WE NEED TO BALANCE THAT WITH

01:52:42.255 --> 01:52:44.424
WITH OUR- CONSERVATION CAMP

01:52:44.491 --> 01:52:46.159

SAVE THE AVERAGE PROJECT IN

01:54:30.897 --> 01:54:33.466
COMPLYING WITH SYKORA I THINK

01:54:33.533 --> 01:54:34.601
THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS

01:54:34.667 --> 01:54:35.935
TO LOOK AT THAT FIRST OF ALL.

01:54:36.002 --> 01:54:38.037
WE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF

01:54:38.104 --> 01:54:39.305
PROJECTS THAT ARE HAVE

01:54:39.372 --> 01:54:40.506
DEDICATED STAFF TO THE MORE

01:54:40.573 --> 01:54:42.008
BEING ACCOMPLISHED IN ABOUT

01:54:42.075 --> 01:54:45.011
EIGHT WEEKS. TEN WEEKS A SUMMER

01:54:45.078 --> 01:54:46.579
LONG OUTLINED TO HALF MONTHS

01:54:46.646 --> 01:54:48.381
WHEREAS IN THE PAST. IF YOU'RE

01:54:48.448 --> 01:54:49.582
ENGAGED IN THE PREPARATION OF

01:54:49.649 --> 01:54:51.851
AN ER TO SUPPORT A PROJECT

01:54:51.918 --> 01:54:52.952
THERE COULD BE UPWARDS OF A

01:54:53.019 --> 01:54:54.387
YEAR OR MORE SO I THINK THERE'S

01:54:54.454 --> 01:54:56.823
A SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS VERA. IN

01:54:56.889 --> 01:54:58.224
ADDITION TO THAT I THINK

01:54:58.291 --> 01:55:00.093
THERE'S ALSO SOME ARE SOME

01:55:00.159 --> 01:55:01.294
CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN

01:55:01.361 --> 01:55:03.429
TO THE FACT THAT. MAINTENANCE

01:55:03.496 --> 01:55:05.098
ACTIVITIES CAN BE CONTEMPLATED

01:55:05.164 --> 01:55:08.034
UNDER CALVI TV PROJECT WHERE

01:55:08.101 --> 01:55:10.336
THAT IS NOT AN AVAILABLE OPTION

01:55:10.403 --> 01:55:12.138
I'M VERY STANDARD SUPER

01:55:12.205 --> 01:55:14.941
ANALYSIS SO FOR INSTANCE. A AYE

01:55:15.008 --> 01:55:16.442
WELL PLANNED PROJECT THAT

01:55:16.509 --> 01:55:17.677
INCLUDES INITIAL TREATMENTS AS

01:55:17.744 --> 01:55:19.512
WELL AS MAINTENANCE TREATMENTS

01:55:19.579 --> 01:55:20.813
COULD BE EFFECTUATED OVER THE

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:23.950
COURSE OF. YEARS WHERE THOSE

01:55:24.017 --> 01:55:25.585
STAIR STEPS OF THERE'S MULTIPLE

01:55:25.652 --> 01:55:29.455
STEPS. OF INITIAL TREATMENT AND

01:55:29.522 --> 01:55:30.690
MAINTENANCE. ALL RIGHT

01:55:30.757 --> 01:55:31.691
TRIGGERED A NECESSITY FOR I.

01:55:31.758 --> 01:55:35.061
SEQUENCE SO THE POINT IS

01:55:35.128 --> 01:55:36.729
THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

01:55:36.796 --> 01:55:38.698
SAVINGS UP FRONT. BUT I DO

01:55:38.765 --> 01:55:39.165
BELIEVE THERE'S ALSO

01:55:39.232 --> 01:55:40.867
SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS IN TERMS OF

01:55:40.933 --> 01:55:41.934
WELL PLANNED PROJECTS AS THEY

01:55:42.001 --> 01:55:44.871
RELATE TO THE MAINSTREAM IT'S

01:55:44.937 --> 01:55:46.472

IDENTITY. OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH

02:03:17.857 --> 02:03:20.025
FIRE IS ONE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO

02:03:20.092 --> 02:03:21.827
BE NATURAL TO PLACE.

02:03:21.894 --> 02:03:23.462
REVITALIZING OUR HUMAN FOR

02:03:23.529 --> 02:03:25.297
RELATIONSHIPS IS PARAMOUNT TO

02:03:25.364 --> 02:03:28.501
THIS THE PRESERVATION OF OUR

02:03:28.567 --> 02:03:30.903
CULTURAL CULTURAL IDENTITY.

02:03:30.970 --> 02:03:32.238
THIS IS WHY WE SEPARATE

02:03:32.304 --> 02:03:34.340
PRESCRIBED FIRE FROM CULTURAL

02:03:34.406 --> 02:03:36.575
BURNING IN THE DISCUSSION. WE

02:03:36.642 --> 02:03:37.743
CAN PRESCRIBE ALL OF OUR WE

02:03:37.810 --> 02:03:39.712
WANT AND WE CAN USE IT AS A

02:03:39.779 --> 02:03:41.914
GREAT SHARED STEWARDSHIP. AND

02:03:41.981 --> 02:03:44.083
SHARED LEARNING TOOL. BUT UNTIL

02:03:44.150 --> 02:03:45.351
OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH FIRE

02:03:45.417 --> 02:03:47.586
RESUMES ITS PLACE AS A CULTURAL

02:03:47.653 --> 02:03:49.321
PROCESS THAT ALIGNS WITH THE

02:03:49.388 --> 02:03:51.090
INDIGENOUS SOCIAL ECOLOGICAL

02:03:51.157 --> 02:03:52.691
FUNCTIONS RELEVANT TO OUR

02:03:52.758 --> 02:03:54.994
HOMELANDS. WE WILL NOT EVEN

02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:56.962
BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE IMPACTS OF

02:03:57.029 --> 02:03:59.298
IN HERE OF A FIRE SOLUTION

02:03:59.365 --> 02:03:59.832
COUPLED WITH THE CHANGING

02:03:59.899 --> 02:04:02.768
CLIMATE. THIS LATER FIRE JUST

02:04:02.835 --> 02:04:04.537
BURNED ABOUT HALF THE HOUSES IN

02:04:04.603 --> 02:04:06.839
HAPPY CAMP. THE CORRECT NAME

02:04:06.906 --> 02:04:09.074
FOR HAPPY CAMP MEANS THE PLACE

02:04:09.141 --> 02:04:11.043
WHERE HAZEL CREEK FLOWS THROUGH.

02:04:11.110 --> 02:04:13.145
THAT TELLS A STORY IN ITSELF AS

02:04:13.212 --> 02:04:14.413
TO THE CULTURAL VEGETATION

02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:16.148
CHARACTERISTICS ONCE ABUNDANT

02:04:16.215 --> 02:04:18.384
ON THE LANDSCAPE. A GOOD

02:04:18.450 --> 02:04:19.718
PORTION OF THIS AREA WAS

02:04:19.785 --> 02:04:21.287
CONVERTED BY THE U. S. FOREST

02:04:21.353 --> 02:04:22.621
SERVICE FOR THE PERPETUAL

02:04:22.688 --> 02:04:25.090
PRODUCTION OF TIMBER. AT ONE

02:04:25.157 --> 02:04:27.459
TIME WE WERE AND EXTENSIVELY IN

02:04:27.526 --> 02:04:28.828
THE FIRST TWO MILES FROM OUR

02:04:28.894 --> 02:04:30.930
VILLAGES. SPOTTING ON THE

02:04:30.996 --> 02:04:32.865
SLITTER FIR WERE CONSISTENTLY

02:04:32.932 --> 02:04:34.667
REPORTED AS OCCURRING TWO MILES

02:04:34.733 --> 02:04:37.002
IN FRONT OF THE FIRE. THIS IS

02:04:37.069 --> 02:04:39.271
NOT COINCIDENCE. WE'RE STARTING

02:04:39.338 --> 02:04:41.040
OVER THERE NOW AND WE NEED TO

02:04:41.106 --> 02:04:42.875
INTEGRATE OUR INDIGENOUS AND

02:04:42.942 --> 02:04:44.543
WESTERN SCIENCES TO RESTORE

02:04:44.610 --> 02:04:45.811
THESE LANDSCAPES BACK TO A

02:04:45.878 --> 02:04:47.613
SOCIALLY ECOLOGICALLY RESILIENT

02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:49.481
STATE. AS OPPOSED TO

02:04:49.548 --> 02:04:51.917
APPROACHING. THE SITUATION FROM

02:04:51.984 --> 02:04:53.953
THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOCIAL

02:04:54.019 --> 02:04:56.388
ECONOMIC RECOVERY ALONE. THE

02:04:56.455 --> 02:04:58.457
LATTER WILL CREATE CONDITIONS

02:04:58.524 --> 02:04:59.959
THE BURN A HIGH SEVERITY AGAIN

02:05:00.025 --> 02:05:01.794
AND AGAIN AT EXTREMELY HIGH

02:05:01.861 --> 02:05:04.597
COSTS. THE CURRENT CLIMATE

02:05:04.663 --> 02:05:06.832
ADAPTATION PLAN BEGINS TO CALL

02:05:06.899 --> 02:05:08.534
OUT WE USED TO START DOWN THIS

02:05:08.601 --> 02:05:09.635
PATH OF ECO CULTURAL

02:05:09.702 --> 02:05:12.304
REVITALIZATION. IT INTRODUCES

02:05:12.371 --> 02:05:13.973
SOME OUTSIDE THE BOX THINKING

02:05:14.039 --> 02:05:15.341
WHEN IT COMES TO ECONOMIC

02:05:15.407 --> 02:05:17.676
MODELS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING FOR

02:05:17.743 --> 02:05:19.511
SUSTAINABILITY AND CONSERVATION

02:05:19.578 --> 02:05:21.513
WITHOUT CREATING MECHANISM FOR

02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:22.815
SOCIAL ECONOMICS TO TRUMP

02:05:22.882 --> 02:05:24.216
SOCIALLY ECOLOGICALLY SOUND

02:05:24.283 --> 02:05:26.886
OUTCOMES. THE CALLS FOR THE

02:05:26.952 --> 02:05:27.953
RECOGNITION OF TRIBAL

02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:29.455
SOVEREIGNTY AND FOCUSED

02:05:29.521 --> 02:05:31.824
ATTENTION ON WATER TO FISH

02:05:31.891 --> 02:05:35.394
WILDLIFE PLANTS AND THE PEOPLE.

02:05:35.461 --> 02:05:36.996
BUT THIS IN ITSELF IS JUST A

02:05:37.062 --> 02:05:39.665
FOUNDATION A POSITIVE FUTURE

02:05:39.732 --> 02:05:41.634
STILL NEEDS TO BE BUILT.

02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:42.968
CREATING RELIABLE FUNDING

02:05:43.035 --> 02:05:44.937
STREAMS DRESSING LIABILITY

02:05:45.004 --> 02:05:47.172
ISSUES HONORING SOVEREIGNTY AND

02:05:47.239 --> 02:05:49.208
RETHINKING APPROACHES TO

02:05:49.275 --> 02:05:51.911
OVERCOME THE SUITE OF BARRIERS

02:05:51.977 --> 02:05:54.847
WE FACE ARE ALL PART OF THE

02:05:54.914 --> 02:05:57.349
DISCUSSION MOVING FORWARD.

02:05:57.416 --> 02:05:59.318
THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO SAY BUT

02:05:59.385 --> 02:06:02.321
NO TIME TODAY. WE ARE WORKING

02:06:02.388 --> 02:06:04.523
TO BUILD A GREATER COALITION

02:06:04.590 --> 02:06:05.791
WORKING TO EXPAND UPON

02:06:05.858 --> 02:06:07.326
COLLECTED THE A COLLECTIVE

02:06:07.393 --> 02:06:09.662
INDIGENOUS VOICE AND WORKING TO

02:06:09.728 --> 02:06:11.697
INCREASE THE PACE AND SCALE OF

02:06:11.764 --> 02:06:13.299
ON THE GROUND ACTION IN OUR

02:06:13.365 --> 02:06:14.733
ANCESTRAL HOMELANDS AT THE SAME

02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:17.736
TIME. WE SEE CREWS FUNDED FOR

02:06:17.803 --> 02:06:19.638
PRESCRIBED BURNING BUT DON'T

02:06:19.705 --> 02:06:21.140
SEE THEM COME HELP US WITH OUR

02:06:21.206 --> 02:06:24.476
BURNS. WE CAN'T ASK FOR PERMITS

02:06:24.543 --> 02:06:25.110
WITHOUT DIMINISHING OUR

02:06:25.177 --> 02:06:27.346
SOVEREIGNTY. OUR PARTNERS CAN'T

02:06:27.413 --> 02:06:28.647
GET PERMITS WHEN SELLING

02:06:28.714 --> 02:06:30.316
CALIFORNIA IS IN THE HEIGHT OF

02:06:30.382 --> 02:06:33.452
FIRE SEASON. WE CAN'T MAINTAIN

02:06:33.519 --> 02:06:35.688
CONSISTENT CAPACITY BECAUSE WE

02:06:35.754 --> 02:06:38.157
RELY ON GRANTS. WE ARE LIMITED

02:06:38.223 --> 02:06:39.625
TO THE GRANTS WE CAN PURSUE

02:06:39.692 --> 02:06:41.527
BECAUSE STATE LAW POLICY AND

02:06:41.593 --> 02:06:44.096
REGULATION HAS NOT CONSIDERED

02:06:44.163 --> 02:06:46.298
THE NEEDS LET ALONE THE

02:06:46.365 --> 02:06:46.832
SOVEREIGNTY OF INDIGENOUS

02:06:46.899 --> 02:06:48.834
PEOPLES. THERE ARE MANY SUCH

02:06:48.901 --> 02:06:50.402
TOPICS THAT ARE RIPE FOR

02:06:50.469 --> 02:06:52.438
FURTHER DISCUSSION. THIS

02:06:52.504 --> 02:06:54.273
TESTIMONY IS A CALL FOR THE

02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:56.508
LEGISLATURE TO REMOVE ANY UP

02:06:56.575 --> 02:06:58.644
POSSIBLE OBSTACLES THAT LIMIT

02:06:58.711 --> 02:07:00.879
TRAVEL BURNING PRACTICES AND

02:07:00.946 --> 02:07:02.581
FOR THE STATE TO FULL SUPPORT

02:07:02.648 --> 02:07:04.183
AND LEARN FROM OUR CULTURAL

02:07:04.249 --> 02:07:06.986
BURNING PRINCIPLES. THE STATE

02:07:07.052 --> 02:07:09.621
SHOULD NOT BE PROPPING. THE

02:07:09.688 --> 02:07:11.223
STATE SHOULD BE PROPPING UP

02:07:11.290 --> 02:07:13.158
TRAVEL CAPACITY NOT LIMITING IT

WILDFIRE. THE C. A B. M. C. WAS

02:09:02.734 --> 02:09:04.770

A NATURAL PART OF THE ECOSYSTEM

02:09:28.227 --> 02:09:30.262
AND WE AS HUMANS ARE PART OF

02:09:30.329 --> 02:09:33.098
NATURE. OUR LAND SISTERS LIVED

RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LAND AND

02:09:36.635 --> 02:09:38.904
FIRE WAS A CRITICAL PART OF

02:09:38.971 --> 02:09:41.173
MAINTAINING THIS BALANCE. IN

AND THE PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT

02:09:47.179 --> 02:09:49.915

02:09:54.820 --> 02:09:56.855
THIS LAND EVOLVED WITH FIRE

02:09:56.922 --> 02:09:59.291
SOME PLANTS ARE FIRE DEPENDENT

02:09:59.358 --> 02:10:03.228

IT'S TIME TO RETURN TO THIS

02:10:27.653 --> 02:10:29.588
TRADITIONAL PRACTICE OF CARING

02:10:29.655 --> 02:10:31.657

02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:53.145

FMC DOESN'T GENERALLY PREFER

02:13:01.306 --> 02:13:03.375
PILE BURNING AS IT BURNS REALLY

02:13:03.442 --> 02:13:05.344
HOT IN ONE PLACE FOR A LONG

02:13:05.410 --> 02:13:07.512

CERTIFICATION PROCESS FOR

02:16:05.223 --> 02:16:08.026
PRIVATE LANDOWNERS SEE FMC

02:16:08.093 --> 02:16:09.661
PLANS TO DESIGN A TRAINING

02:16:09.728 --> 02:16:12.163
PROGRAM FOR LANDOWNERS TO GAIN

02:16:12.230 --> 02:16:13.598
THE PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE AND

02:16:13.665 --> 02:16:15.467
EXPERIENCE TO ATTAIN THIS

02:16:15.534 --> 02:16:17.869
CERTIFICATION THIS WILL HELP

02:16:17.936 --> 02:16:20.038
PUT FIRE BACK INTO THE HANDS OF

02:16:20.105 --> 02:16:22.841
THE PEOPLE. PRIVATE LANDOWNERS

02:16:22.908 --> 02:16:24.876
CAN BURN THEIR LAND WHILE

02:16:24.943 --> 02:16:26.811
TRIBES GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND

02:16:26.878 --> 02:16:30.448
NGOS BURN AT A LANDSCAPE LEVEL

02:16:30.515 --> 02:16:31.883
WE SHOULD BE DOING LANDSCAPE

02:16:31.950 --> 02:16:33.952
LEVEL BACK BURN AND BEFORE

02:16:34.019 --> 02:16:36.187
WHILE SUCH BUYERS SEASON STARTS

02:16:36.254 --> 02:16:38.223
AS A METHOD OF WILDFIRE

02:16:38.290 --> 02:16:41.126
PREVENTION. IF WE WANT TO

02:16:41.192 --> 02:16:43.128
EXPAND THE USE OF PRESCRIBED

02:16:43.194 --> 02:16:45.330
FIRE WE MUST UTILIZE EVERY

02:16:45.397 --> 02:16:47.632
AVAILABLE RESOURCE IN EVERY

02:16:47.699 --> 02:16:50.168
AVAILABLE BURN WINDOW TO

02:16:50.235 --> 02:16:51.836
REINSTITUTE TRADITIONAL FIRE

02:16:51.903 --> 02:16:54.973
REGIMES WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO

02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:56.508
BUILD A CULTURE OF UYERS THAT

02:16:56.575 --> 02:16:59.411
IS INCLUSIVE OF ALL ETHNICITIES

02:16:59.477 --> 02:17:02.447
AND SOCIAL ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS.

02:17:02.514 --> 02:17:03.915
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF

02:17:03.982 --> 02:17:06.585
CALIFORNIA IN FACT ALL STATES

02:17:06.651 --> 02:17:09.321
HAD A GROSS NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

02:17:09.387 --> 02:17:11.423
FOR PRESCRIBED BURN LIABILITY.

02:17:11.489 --> 02:17:13.058
PRESCRIBED BURN PROGRAMS NEED

02:17:13.124 --> 02:17:15.627
TO BE FULLY FUNDED AND STAFFED

02:17:15.694 --> 02:17:17.829
CULTURAL BURN SHOULD BE EXEMPT

02:17:17.896 --> 02:17:20.465
FROM AIR QUALITY REGULATIONS

02:17:20.532 --> 02:17:22.467
AND FINALLY WE NEED TO CHANGE

02:17:22.534 --> 02:17:25.337
THE NARRATIVE ABOUT FIRE THERE

02:17:25.403 --> 02:17:28.239
IS SUCH A THING AS GOOD FIRE IT

02:17:28.306 --> 02:17:29.975
IS A NECESSARY PART OF THE

02:17:30.041 --> 02:17:33.712
ECOSYSTEM. EVERY DAY IS A GOOD

02:17:33.778 --> 02:17:37.015
DAY TO BURN SOMEWHERE. THANK

WHY WE THINK PRESCRIBED FIRE

02:18:11.082 --> 02:18:12.083
TOGETHER WITH ECOLOGICALLY

02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:14.319
BASED THAN IN OUR FORESTS IS

02:18:14.386 --> 02:18:16.655
CRITICAL TO THE HEALTH AND WELL

02:18:16.721 --> 02:18:18.223
BEING OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. THE

02:18:18.289 --> 02:18:20.558
NATURE CONSERVANCY WAS

02:18:20.625 --> 02:18:21.393
ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN FIFTY

02:18:21.459 --> 02:18:23.828
ONE. BEGAN APPLYING PRESCRIBED

02:18:23.895 --> 02:18:26.398
FIRE TO ITS NATURE PRESERVES IN

02:18:26.464 --> 02:18:27.899
NINETEEN SIXTY TWO. AND NOW

02:18:27.966 --> 02:18:30.035
LEADS THE LARGEST NON

PRESCRIBED FIRE TRAININGS

02:18:41.479 --> 02:18:44.916
ACROSS THE COUNTRY EVERY YEAR.

02:18:44.983 --> 02:18:46.885
FOR THE RECORD I'M SUBMITTING

02:18:46.951 --> 02:18:48.820
THE NATURE CONSERVANCY'S CASE

02:18:48.887 --> 02:18:51.156
FOR ECOLOGICAL FORESTRY THIS

THINNING AND PRESCRIBED FIRE

02:18:55.994 --> 02:18:58.463
WHEN USED TOGETHER CAN RESTORE

02:18:58.530 --> 02:19:00.465
FOREST BIODIVERSITY. AND

02:19:00.532 --> 02:19:02.634
MODERATE THE RISK OF HIGH

02:19:02.701 --> 02:19:05.503
INTENSITY WILDFIRES. REGARDING

02:19:05.570 --> 02:19:06.905
THE SCIENCE I WANT TO TAKE A

02:19:06.971 --> 02:19:09.908
MOMENT TO HIGHLIGHT THREE KEY

02:19:09.974 --> 02:19:12.177
FINDINGS FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

02:19:12.243 --> 02:19:15.180
FIRST WHEN THEIR NAME IN FORCES

02:19:15.246 --> 02:19:17.682
FOLLOWED BY PRESCRIBED FIRE THE

02:19:17.749 --> 02:19:19.651
RISK OF FLAMES REACHING THE

02:19:19.718 --> 02:19:21.352
TOPS OF TREES OTHERWISE KNOWN

02:19:21.419 --> 02:19:25.090
AS CROWN FIRE. IS REDUCED.

02:19:25.156 --> 02:19:27.525
SECOND THE BENEFITS OF THINNING

02:19:27.592 --> 02:19:29.594
SERVICE ON LADDER FUELS IN

02:19:48.546 --> 02:19:50.982
EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REDUCE FOREST

02:19:51.049 --> 02:19:53.818
FUELS. AND FINALLY IT'S

02:19:53.885 --> 02:19:54.953
IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT

02:29:32.396 --> 02:29:34.865
WITNESSING THAT DAY WAS PRETTY

02:29:34.932 --> 02:29:38.436
EXTRAORDINARY- IT WAS CONSUMING

02:29:38.502 --> 02:29:40.671
LAND AT A RAPID RATE-

02:29:40.738 --> 02:29:42.873
ULTIMATELY BECAME. MAYBE THE

02:29:42.940 --> 02:29:44.542
BIGGEST SINGLE FIRE OF THAT

02:29:44.608 --> 02:29:47.445
CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY AND WE

02:29:47.511 --> 02:29:51.115
ALSO MEASURED THE HIGHEST LOOP.

02:29:51.182 --> 02:29:53.084
IN THE HISTORY OF FIRESIDE I

02:29:53.150 --> 02:29:55.553
HEARD- OFFICIAL TELL ME THAT

02:29:55.619 --> 02:29:58.823
THEY MEASURE THIS WOMB AT FIFTY

02:29:58.889 --> 02:29:59.957
THOUSAND FEET IN ELEVATION AND

02:30:00.024 --> 02:30:00.925
YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO GET A MOVE

02:30:00.991 --> 02:30:02.727
LIKE THAT. WOULD YOU HAVE

02:30:02.793 --> 02:30:09.400
INTENSE FIRE BEHAVIOUR COUPLED.

02:30:09.467 --> 02:30:12.970
WITH THE- VERY YOUR LOOKING AND

02:30:13.037 --> 02:30:14.472
THAT'S WHAT WE HAD ON THE NASH

02:30:14.538 --> 02:30:18.609
FOREST ALL THE US FOR US. WE

02:30:18.676 --> 02:30:21.312
HAD CONDUCTED. PROBABLY FOR THE

02:30:21.379 --> 02:30:23.180
PAST THREE YEARS SOME

02:30:23.247 --> 02:30:24.949
PRESCRIBED BURNING AND SOME

02:30:25.015 --> 02:30:27.818
PILE BERNIE ALL ALONG THE NORTH

02:30:27.885 --> 02:30:30.087
BOUNDARY OF OUR PROPERTY AND SO

02:30:30.154 --> 02:30:32.022
WHEN THE CREEK FIRE ROARED UP

02:30:32.089 --> 02:30:34.158
OUT OF THE BIG CREEK CANYON. IT

02:30:34.225 --> 02:30:36.327
HIT OUR PROPERTY BOUNDARY AND

02:30:36.394 --> 02:30:37.795
JUST SAT RIGHT DOWN ON THE

02:30:37.862 --> 02:30:40.297
GROUND AND CAL FIRE WAS ABLE TO

02:30:40.364 --> 02:30:42.366
STOP IT THEY'RE REALLY ON A

02:30:42.433 --> 02:30:45.669
SINGLE LANE DIRT ROAD IN THE

02:30:45.736 --> 02:30:48.539
MIDDLE THE POOREST. PRETTY THEY

02:30:48.606 --> 02:30:50.074
COULDN'T STOP BACKFIRE ANYWHERE

02:30:50.141 --> 02:30:53.210
ELSE ON DAY ONE TWO AND THREE

02:30:53.277 --> 02:30:55.246
EXCEPT ON OUR LAND THAT FORCED

02:30:55.312 --> 02:30:58.082
IT TO ROTATE AROUND OUR LAND.

02:30:58.149 --> 02:31:01.085
WHICH GAVE YOU- CAL FIRE IN

02:31:01.152 --> 02:31:04.688
SOME OF OUR PERSONNEL ABOUT AN

02:31:04.755 --> 02:31:06.524
EXTRA TWENTY FOUR HOURS. TO

02:31:06.590 --> 02:31:09.260
PREPARE THE PALACE SHAVER LAKE.

02:31:09.326 --> 02:31:12.329
AND LIKE TOM MENTIONED EARLIER

02:31:12.396 --> 02:31:14.398
THERE WERE FIVE PROJECTS THAT

02:31:14.465 --> 02:31:16.333
WERE DONE IN FRESNO MADERA

02:31:16.400 --> 02:31:17.935
COUNTY THAT WERE ON THE

02:31:18.002 --> 02:31:20.037
GOVERNOR'S LEFT. AND SO REALLY

02:31:20.104 --> 02:31:22.339
IT THE FACT THAT WE STOPPED

02:31:22.406 --> 02:31:24.475
THAT BUYERS FORGET AROUND OUR

02:31:24.542 --> 02:31:28.279
PROPERTY ON DAY TWO. COUPLED

02:31:28.345 --> 02:31:30.881
WITH ALL THOSE YOUR BREAK

02:31:30.948 --> 02:31:33.951
PROJECT THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN

02:31:34.018 --> 02:31:35.519
AND AROUND OUR LANDS AND OTHER

02:31:35.586 --> 02:31:38.289
PRIVATE LANDS AROUND THE COUNTY

02:31:38.355 --> 02:31:41.258
SHAVER LAKE AND THEN JUST- A

02:31:41.325 --> 02:31:42.960
PRETTY HER WROTE EFFORT ON THE

02:31:43.027 --> 02:31:44.495
PART OF FIREFIGHTERS. IT WAS

02:31:44.562 --> 02:31:46.931
THE COMBIATION OF THOSE THREE

02:31:46.997 --> 02:31:49.133
THINGS. THAT REALLY STAYED THE

02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:51.302
COUNTY CHEVROLET ANY ONE OF

02:31:51.368 --> 02:31:52.870
THOSE THREE THINGS ARE TAKEN

02:31:52.937 --> 02:31:54.705
OUT OF THE EQUATION I REALLY

02:31:54.772 --> 02:31:56.240
DOUBT THAT THE TOWNSHIP RELATED

02:31:56.307 --> 02:32:00.010
HERE TODAY. SO REALLY WE STAND

02:32:00.077 --> 02:32:02.046
HERE AS- I THINK A PRETTY

02:32:02.112 --> 02:32:04.248
IMPRESSIVE ESTIMATES. THAT

02:32:04.315 --> 02:32:06.517
YOU'LL MANAGEMENT. ARE

02:32:06.584 --> 02:32:09.153
PRESCRIBED BURNING ARE THESE

02:32:09.220 --> 02:32:12.456
KINDS OF PRACTICES. AND NAY

02:32:12.523 --> 02:32:15.326
LANDSCAPES. FROM REALLY

02:32:15.392 --> 02:32:18.329
AGGRESSIVE- WILDFIRES IT'S

02:32:18.395 --> 02:32:19.763
SOMETHING THAT WE ARE GOING TO

02:32:19.830 --> 02:32:23.000
HAVE TO ENGAGE IN IN CALIFORNIA

02:32:23.067 --> 02:32:24.568
I APPRECIATE SO MANY THINK THAT

02:32:24.635 --> 02:32:26.504
SOME OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS

02:32:26.570 --> 02:32:28.672
HAVE TALKED ABOUT LIKE. WE HAVE

02:32:28.739 --> 02:32:31.208
TO USE EVERY TOOL THAT WE HAVE

02:32:31.275 --> 02:32:33.177
AT OUR DISPOSAL TO TRY AND

02:32:33.244 --> 02:32:35.212
COMBAT THIS OP PROBLEM WE HAVE

02:32:35.279 --> 02:32:37.548
DUG A HOLE. FOR OURSELVES IN

02:32:37.615 --> 02:32:39.383
CALIFORNIA OVER THE PAST

02:32:39.450 --> 02:32:41.085
HUNDRED YEARS WE'VE ALLOWED OUR

02:32:41.151 --> 02:32:43.888
WILD LANDSCAPES TO BECOME MORE

02:32:43.954 --> 02:32:50.227
AND. MORE DANCE AND WE'RE

02:32:50.294 --> 02:32:52.463
SEEING THESE BY. THAT WE WAITED

02:32:52.530 --> 02:32:53.697
BROKE EVERYTHING AT THEM AND

02:32:53.764 --> 02:32:55.065
YET WE COULD NOT IT THEM OR

02:32:55.132 --> 02:32:56.934
SLOW THE DOWN UNLESS WE'VE DONE.

02:32:57.001 --> 02:32:58.669
SOME THAT YOU MAY. IT GOING TO

02:32:58.736 --> 02:33:00.838
TAKE UP. A COUPLE DECADES

02:33:00.905 --> 02:33:05.109
YOU'RE SEE SOME- YOU REALLY

02:33:05.175 --> 02:33:06.410
NEED TO RETURN ON OUR

02:33:06.477 --> 02:33:09.146
INVESTMENT BUT I HOPE THAT ALL

02:33:09.213 --> 02:33:10.948
OF US HERE IN CALIFORNIA CAN

02:33:11.015 --> 02:33:13.017
START MOVING OUR FORESTS AND

02:33:13.083 --> 02:33:15.185
OUR WILD LANDSCAPES. IN THE

02:33:15.252 --> 02:33:17.755
RIGHT DIRECTION. FOR US WHAT

02:33:17.821 --> 02:33:19.523
WE'VE BEEN DOING IS JUST TRYING

02:33:19.590 --> 02:33:21.926
TO CREATE THE NUMBER OF TREES

02:33:21.992 --> 02:33:23.427
PER ACRE DOUBTS WILL MORE

02:33:23.494 --> 02:33:26.564
NATURAL MORE HISTORIC LEVEL. ON

02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:30.501
OUR LANDS WE PROBABLY HAD A

02:33:30.568 --> 02:33:31.068
HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED

02:33:31.135 --> 02:33:31.602
FIFTY TREES PER ACRE ON

02:33:31.669 --> 02:33:33.604
ADJACENT FEDERAL LANDS WE WERE

02:33:33.671 --> 02:33:36.040
LOOKING AT SIX SEVEN EIGHT

02:33:36.106 --> 02:33:40.277
HUNDRED TREES PER ACRE AND 60%

02:33:40.344 --> 02:33:40.844
OF THOSE TREES WERE DEBT. SO

02:33:40.911 --> 02:33:43.714
THERE WAS REALLY NO CHANCE- TO

02:33:43.781 --> 02:33:46.617
STOP THIS FIRE OUT IN OF COURSE

02:33:46.684 --> 02:33:50.254
LANDSCAPE. THAT LOOKS LIKE THAT

02:33:50.321 --> 02:33:52.222
THAT MORE THAN HALF DEBT. SO

02:33:52.289 --> 02:33:53.891
ANYWAY I COULD GO ON FOR HOURS

02:33:53.958 --> 02:33:55.759
WHAT I WOULD RATHER GET STOP

02:33:55.826 --> 02:33:58.329
RIGHT THERE AND ALLOW QUESTIONS

02:33:58.395 --> 02:34:01.131
TO BE- TALK TO THE PANEL AT

02:34:01.198 --> 02:34:04.168
THIS TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU

02:34:04.234 --> 02:34:05.869
VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION

02:34:05.936 --> 02:34:06.870
NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO

02:34:06.937 --> 02:34:08.405
QUESTIONS I HAVE I HAVE SOME

02:34:08.472 --> 02:34:11.976
QUESTIONS I'LL KICK IT OFF-

02:34:12.042 --> 02:34:12.610
FIRST FOR MISTER TRIP IF WE CAN

02:34:12.676 --> 02:34:13.677
BRING HIM BACK UP PERHAPS IN

02:34:13.744 --> 02:34:17.948
THE VIDEO- AND MAYBE- MAYBE MR

02:34:18.015 --> 02:34:18.482
PORTER ALSO ONCE TRIED TO

02:34:18.549 --> 02:34:19.950
ANSWER THIS WHICH IS. I'M

02:34:20.017 --> 02:34:21.785
WONDERING HOW MUCH OF THE STATE

02:34:21.852 --> 02:34:23.253
TRADITIONALLY HAD CULTURAL

02:34:23.320 --> 02:34:24.855
BURNS WAS THAT THE ENTIRE STATE

02:34:24.922 --> 02:34:26.290
OF CALIFORNIA- OR CERTAIN

02:34:26.357 --> 02:34:28.792
REGIONS ONLY. AND YOU KNOW OF

02:34:28.859 --> 02:34:30.594
COURSE GOING BACK THE STATE WAS

02:34:30.661 --> 02:34:32.196
A LOT LESS POPULATED THAN IT IS

02:34:32.262 --> 02:34:34.098
NOW AND I'M WONDERING WHETHER

02:34:34.164 --> 02:34:35.633
THERE WERE. IT WOULD WE'RE

02:34:35.699 --> 02:34:36.934
TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS OF ACRES

02:34:37.001 --> 02:34:38.569
A YEAR THOUSANDS OF ACRES A

02:34:38.636 --> 02:34:39.536
YEAR YOU KNOW WHAT WERE THE

02:34:39.603 --> 02:34:41.138
TRADITIONAL CULTURAL BURN

02:34:41.205 --> 02:34:43.941
PATTERNS WITH THAT OF LOOKED

02:34:44.008 --> 02:34:44.475
LIKE A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED

02:34:44.541 --> 02:34:51.015
YEARS AGO. GOOD QUESTION- HI I

02:34:51.081 --> 02:34:53.250
CAN'T REALLY SPEAK FOR THE

02:34:53.317 --> 02:34:55.386
ENTIRETY OF THE STATE. I KNOW

02:34:55.452 --> 02:34:56.720
THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

02:34:56.787 --> 02:34:59.189
DIFFERENT INDIGENOUS CULTURES-

02:34:59.256 --> 02:35:02.326
ORIGINATING- THROUGHOUT- THE

02:35:02.393 --> 02:35:05.229
STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IN OUR

02:35:05.295 --> 02:35:07.264
AREA I'M IN A IN THE

02:35:07.331 --> 02:35:08.899
NORTHWESTERN CORNER OF THE

02:35:08.966 --> 02:35:11.568
STATE- WE LIVED IN PERMANENT

02:35:11.635 --> 02:35:13.637
HOUSES MADE OUT OF SPLIT PORT

02:35:13.704 --> 02:35:16.173
ORFORD CEDAR PLANKS. SO WE LIVE

02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:18.976
IN PERMANENT WOODEN STRUCTURES-

02:35:19.043 --> 02:35:21.712
MY MUCH LIKE WE DO TODAY AND WE

02:35:21.779 --> 02:35:24.982
EMPLOYED FIRE A VAST SCALE

02:35:25.049 --> 02:35:26.984
ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE. VERY

02:35:27.051 --> 02:35:29.019
INTENSIVELY WITHIN THE FIRST

02:35:29.086 --> 02:35:30.187
TWO MILES LIKE I SPOKE TO

02:35:30.254 --> 02:35:32.756
EARLIER. BUT ALSO ALONG THE

02:35:32.823 --> 02:35:35.626
STRATEGIC RIDGELINES WHERE WE

02:35:35.693 --> 02:35:38.595
WOULD BE DEPENDING ON ON.

02:35:38.662 --> 02:35:41.198
HUNTING FOR LARGE GAME AND

02:35:41.265 --> 02:35:44.368
THINGS LIKE THAT AND SO THE

02:35:44.435 --> 02:35:46.670
ALSO WE HAD CEREMONIAL BURNING

02:35:46.737 --> 02:35:48.605
PRACTICES THAT OCCURRED IN THE

02:35:48.672 --> 02:35:51.909
SAME PLACE- EVERY YEAR- THAT

02:35:51.975 --> 02:35:55.079
WERE LANDSCAPE. SCALE WERE YOU

02:35:55.145 --> 02:35:56.780
KNOW ONE NOW RIGHT INDICATOR

02:35:56.847 --> 02:35:59.783
SHOWED ITSELF- FIRES WOULD BE

02:35:59.850 --> 02:36:03.854
LET AND THEY WOULD BURN. FOR

02:36:03.921 --> 02:36:05.355
THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR. OUR

02:36:05.422 --> 02:36:06.623
AREA BEING SURROUNDED BY

02:36:06.690 --> 02:36:10.627
MULTIPLE WILDERNESS AREAS IS.

02:36:10.694 --> 02:36:12.863
IS THE TYPE OF PLACE WHERE A

02:36:12.930 --> 02:36:14.631
PERSON COULD PROBABLY-

02:36:14.698 --> 02:36:16.066
REINSTATE A LOT OF THIS

02:36:16.133 --> 02:36:18.235
TRADITIONAL TIMING- DUE TO THE

02:36:18.302 --> 02:36:20.971
FACT THAT IS ONLY TWO PERCENT-

02:36:21.038 --> 02:36:23.040
DEVELOPED AND MOST OF THAT

02:36:23.107 --> 02:36:24.141
BEING DOWN IN THE RIVER

02:36:24.208 --> 02:36:25.676
CORRIDOR LIKE WE WERE

02:36:25.743 --> 02:36:28.979
TRADITIONALLY- HOWEVER. IN

02:36:29.046 --> 02:36:32.683
OTHER AREAS YOU KNOW ITS THE

02:36:32.750 --> 02:36:34.818
BUILT ENVIRONMENT- DEFINITELY-

02:36:34.885 --> 02:36:37.321
CREATES CHALLENGES WHERE'S IF

02:36:37.387 --> 02:36:39.456
PERHAPS MAYBE THE INDIGENOUS

02:36:39.523 --> 02:36:41.125
CULTURE WAS MORE OF A NOMADIC

02:36:41.191 --> 02:36:43.794
IN NATURE- PERHAPS DEPENDING ON

02:36:43.861 --> 02:36:45.229
THE SEASONALITY OF THE USE OF

02:36:45.295 --> 02:36:46.997
THE RESOURCES EMPLOYED IN A

02:36:47.064 --> 02:36:50.934
GIVEN AREA- MAYBE THE PEOPLE OF

02:36:51.001 --> 02:36:52.469
THE POLICE WOULD LIKE TO FIRE

02:36:52.536 --> 02:36:55.873
ON THEIR WAY OUT. AND WALK AWAY

02:36:55.939 --> 02:36:58.876
FOR THE SEASON. THAT BEHAVING

02:36:58.942 --> 02:37:00.344
THAT WAY WOULD BE DIFFICULT

02:37:00.410 --> 02:37:01.745
TODAY IF THERE'S A TOWN BUILT

02:37:01.812 --> 02:37:05.582
THEIR BUT YOU KNOW EMPLOYING SO

02:37:05.649 --> 02:37:08.786
MORE FOCUSED- PRESCRIBED FIRE-

02:37:08.852 --> 02:37:11.388
PRACTICES- YOU KNOW WITH SOME

02:37:11.455 --> 02:37:12.923
OF THE TOOLS WE DIDN'T HAVE

02:37:12.990 --> 02:37:17.060
BEFORE LIKE FIRE ENGINES. AND

02:37:17.127 --> 02:37:19.396
THINGS LIKE THAT. MEANS THAT WE

02:37:19.463 --> 02:37:20.931
STILL COULD EMPLOY SOME

02:37:20.998 --> 02:37:22.432
BURNING- TWO CHIEFS OF SIMILAR

02:37:22.499 --> 02:37:25.068
OBJECTIVES AND PROTECT HOMES M.

02:37:25.135 --> 02:37:26.937
IN THOSE AREAS AS WELL IT WOULD

02:37:27.004 --> 02:37:29.306
JUST HAVE TO BE- MUCH MORE

02:37:29.373 --> 02:37:32.810
PLANNED- AND CARRIED OUT. A LOT

02:37:32.876 --> 02:37:52.830
MORE STRATEGICALLY. RIGHT. I'M

02:37:52.896 --> 02:37:55.032
SORRY I DID UP MY MICROPHONE ON

02:37:55.098 --> 02:37:56.967
SO I'M ASSUMING THAT THE BURNS

02:37:57.034 --> 02:37:57.835
OF CULTURAL BRANDS WERE MOSTLY

02:37:57.901 --> 02:38:00.637
HAPPENING RIGHT AROUND A NEAR

02:38:00.704 --> 02:38:02.039
WHERE PEOPLE WERE LIVING AND

02:38:02.105 --> 02:38:03.907
THEN AND FURTHER DEEP INTO THE

02:38:03.974 --> 02:38:05.342
WILDERNESS IT WOULD BE ONLY A

02:38:05.409 --> 02:38:06.944
LIGHTNING STRIKE THAT SORT OF

02:38:07.010 --> 02:38:08.011
EVENT SO THERE MIGHT BE PARTS

02:38:08.078 --> 02:38:11.181
THAT THE FORCE THAT ONE WERE

02:38:11.248 --> 02:38:15.285
AND BURNING. TO MUCH. I'M I'M

02:38:15.352 --> 02:38:19.022
WONDERING. YOU MENTIONED A FEW

02:38:19.089 --> 02:38:24.428
OF THE WAYS THAT WE COULD HELP

02:38:24.494 --> 02:38:25.462
REMOVE SOME OF THE VERY

02:38:25.529 --> 02:38:27.531
BARRIERS THAT YOU FACE ARE

02:38:27.598 --> 02:38:28.866
THERE OTHER WAYS THAT THE STATE

02:38:28.932 --> 02:38:30.901
COULD BE A PARTNER WITH YOU AND

02:38:30.968 --> 02:38:32.769
OTHER TRIBES IN THE CULTURAL

02:38:32.836 --> 02:38:41.845
BURNS. YES YEAH I WOULD GO

02:38:41.912 --> 02:38:43.413
AHEAD AND CLARIFY THAT FURTHER

02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:45.315
OUT IN THE WILDERNESS- BURNING

02:38:45.382 --> 02:38:48.418
WAS OCCURRING- IT JUST MOSTLY

02:38:48.485 --> 02:38:50.287
WAS STRATEGIC IN NATURE SO THE

02:38:50.354 --> 02:38:51.822
WITH LIGHTNING MISSIONS WOULD

02:38:51.889 --> 02:38:53.490
BE CONFINED TO SMALLER AREAS

02:38:53.557 --> 02:38:54.992
BUMPING UP AGAINST RECENT OUR

02:38:55.058 --> 02:38:56.894
FOOTPRINTS. ALONG THE RIDGE

02:38:56.960 --> 02:38:59.296
SYSTEMS. A WORD WORD LIGHTNING

02:38:59.363 --> 02:39:02.900
GENERAL STRIKES- BUT- AND WE

02:39:02.966 --> 02:39:05.602
HAVE A LOT A LOT OF INSTANCES

02:39:05.669 --> 02:39:06.770
WHERE WHERE THAT IS HELD IN OUR

02:39:06.837 --> 02:39:10.774
ORAL- KNOWLEDGE TRANSMISSION.

02:39:10.841 --> 02:39:11.942
BUT THERE WHEN IT COMES TO

02:39:12.009 --> 02:39:12.910
PARTNERING WITH THE STATE TO

02:39:12.976 --> 02:39:14.611
OVERCOME BARRIERS THERE THERE

02:39:14.678 --> 02:39:17.080
ARE A LOT OF WAYS WE CAN DO

02:39:17.147 --> 02:39:20.550
THAT- WE'VE BEEN SPEAKING WITH

02:39:20.617 --> 02:39:24.321
MAGUIRE'S OFFICE- ABOUT-

02:39:24.388 --> 02:39:26.356
DEVELOPING A FUNDING SOURCE-

02:39:26.423 --> 02:39:28.558
STARTING AT ABOUT TEN MILLION

02:39:28.625 --> 02:39:32.129
DOLLARS IN THE FIRST YEAR- TO.

02:39:32.195 --> 02:39:33.563
TO BE ABLE TO WORK TO PARTNER

02:39:33.630 --> 02:39:35.232
WITH TRIBES I'M MORE OF A

02:39:35.299 --> 02:39:36.867
NEGOTIATED BASIS ON A SOVEREIGN

02:39:36.934 --> 02:39:39.369
TO SOVEREIGN LEVEL- TO TRY TO

02:39:39.436 --> 02:39:41.738
COME UP WITH SOME WAYS- TO

02:39:41.805 --> 02:39:45.008
ACTUALLY WORK TOGETHER- AS

02:39:45.075 --> 02:39:45.575
SOVEREIGNS TO OVERCOME THESE

02:39:45.642 --> 02:39:48.478
ISSUES YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES

02:39:48.545 --> 02:39:50.447
TO THINGS LIKE- AIR QUALITY

02:39:50.514 --> 02:39:53.517
MANAGEMENT. YOU KNOW THERE ARE

02:39:53.583 --> 02:39:54.918
THERE ARE SOME STRENGTHS YOU

02:39:54.985 --> 02:39:56.853
KNOW I SPOKE A LOT TO USING

02:39:56.920 --> 02:39:57.287
STRENGTH TO OVERCOME

02:39:57.354 --> 02:39:59.323
WEAKNESSES- THERE ARE SOME

02:39:59.389 --> 02:40:00.557
STRINGS TO THINGS LIKE TO

02:40:00.624 --> 02:40:02.859
TRAVEL AUTHORITY RULE- IN THE

02:40:02.926 --> 02:40:05.896
CLEAN AIR ACT- TO WHERE TRIBES

02:40:05.963 --> 02:40:07.898
CAN ACTUALLY DEVELOP THEIR OWN

02:40:07.965 --> 02:40:10.634
PLANS TO MAGIC MANAGER QUALITY.

02:40:10.701 --> 02:40:14.938
IF EVERYONE CAN AGREE TO IT

02:40:15.005 --> 02:40:17.107
THERE'S SOME YOU KNOW THERE'S

02:40:17.174 --> 02:40:19.543
THE WESTERN REGIONAL AIR

02:40:19.609 --> 02:40:21.411
PARTNERSHIP PUBLISHED SOME

02:40:21.478 --> 02:40:23.180
GUIDANCE IN TWO THOUSAND NINE.

02:40:23.246 --> 02:40:26.283
OR TWO THAN FIVE AROUND THE-

02:40:26.350 --> 02:40:28.785
REGIONAL HAZE RULE DISCUSSING A

02:40:28.852 --> 02:40:32.389
PATHWAY FOR CAT CLASSIFYING-

02:40:32.456 --> 02:40:34.458
NATURAL VERSES ANTIGENIC

02:40:34.524 --> 02:40:37.160
COMMISSION SOURCES AND THEY

02:40:37.227 --> 02:40:39.429
FOUND PATHWAYS TO IDENTIFY.

02:40:39.496 --> 02:40:41.631
ULTRA BURNING AS PART OF THE

02:40:41.698 --> 02:40:43.500
NATURAL BACKGROUND IN A NATURAL

02:40:43.567 --> 02:40:46.403
EMISSIONS SOURCE YOU KNOW A LOT

02:40:46.470 --> 02:40:48.372
OF TIMES WE INTERPRET WELL IT'S

02:40:48.438 --> 02:40:49.906
NOT ALWAYS A LAWLER POLICY THAT

02:40:49.973 --> 02:40:51.108
BECOMES A BARRIER BUT THE

02:40:51.174 --> 02:40:53.143
INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW IN

02:40:53.210 --> 02:40:54.311
THE CREATION OF THE POLICY THAT

02:40:54.378 --> 02:40:57.481
BECOMES A BARRIER. AND YOU KNOW

02:40:57.547 --> 02:40:59.483
WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT THE WAY

02:40:59.549 --> 02:41:01.051
WE VIEW FAR TODAY WE LOOK AT

02:41:01.118 --> 02:41:03.153
THE IGNITION AS THE CAUSE OR

02:41:03.220 --> 02:41:05.155
THE EMISSIONS SOURCE HE MAY BE

02:41:05.222 --> 02:41:06.823
IN A HUMAN OR AN ANTHROPOGENIC

02:41:06.890 --> 02:41:08.925
IGNITION. BUT IT'S A FUEL

02:41:08.992 --> 02:41:10.861
ACCUMULATION THAT ACTUALLY IS

02:41:10.927 --> 02:41:14.297
CREATES THE LEVEL OF IMPACT

02:41:14.364 --> 02:41:15.932
RELATED TO THE MISSION ITSELF.

02:41:15.999 --> 02:41:19.102
AND SO IN IN THAT ASPECT. ONE

02:41:19.169 --> 02:41:20.103
COULD BEGIN TO INTERPRET

02:41:20.170 --> 02:41:21.705
CULTURE BURNING AND PRESCRIBED

02:41:21.772 --> 02:41:24.474
FIRE AS A NATURAL EMISSIONS

02:41:24.541 --> 02:41:25.642
SOURCE BECAUSE IT IS THE FUEL

02:41:25.709 --> 02:41:27.444
ITSELF AND SPENT THE THAT IS A

02:41:27.511 --> 02:41:31.948
MEETING THE CRITERIA POLLUTANT

02:41:32.015 --> 02:41:33.216
NOT THE FACT THAT SOMEONE WOULD.

02:41:33.283 --> 02:41:35.052
THAT SAID YOU KNOW THERE'S

02:41:35.118 --> 02:41:38.655
THERE ARE A LOT MORE- OF THOSE

02:41:38.722 --> 02:41:41.391
TYPES OF EXAMPLES OUT THERE

02:41:41.458 --> 02:41:42.325
WITH WITH DIFFERENT DIFFERENT

02:41:42.392 --> 02:41:44.494
ASPECTS OF THE LETTER HOLDING

02:41:44.561 --> 02:41:47.597
US UP TODAY- YOU KNOW THERE'S

02:41:47.664 --> 02:41:50.500
SO. TRADE STRUCTURE TEXAN

02:41:50.567 --> 02:41:54.438
TRADES THAT TAKE PLACE BETWEEN-

02:41:54.504 --> 02:41:56.840
THE BA AND KALIFORNIA FOR

02:41:56.907 --> 02:41:59.943
SERVICE WILL TRIBES CAN COMPACT

02:42:00.010 --> 02:42:01.011
THAT RESPONSIBILITY FROM THE

02:42:01.078 --> 02:42:03.680
FIT FROM THE VA IF WE HAVE THE

02:42:03.747 --> 02:42:05.549
RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN

02:42:05.615 --> 02:42:06.750
LEVEL OF TRAINING AND

02:42:06.817 --> 02:42:09.419
QUALIFICATION AND BASELINE

02:42:09.486 --> 02:42:10.921
LEADERSHIP IN SUPPORT POSITIONS

02:42:10.987 --> 02:42:12.689
SO IF WE CAN MEET SOME OF THOSE

02:42:12.756 --> 02:42:15.125
STANDARDS AND CRITERIA. WE CAN

02:42:15.192 --> 02:42:18.128
THEN BECOME. ANOTHER PARTY TO

02:42:18.195 --> 02:42:20.997
THOSE AGREEMENTS AND ACTUALLY-

02:42:21.064 --> 02:42:23.100
TRADE DIRECT PROTECTION AREAS

02:42:23.166 --> 02:42:25.669
AND ACTUALLY YOU KNOW. THE FOR

02:42:25.735 --> 02:42:27.737
SERVICE ISSUES CAL FIRE PERMITS

02:42:27.804 --> 02:42:29.639
THROUGH THOSE AGREEMENTS AND

02:42:29.706 --> 02:42:30.774
TRIBES CAN DO THOSE TYPES OF

02:42:30.841 --> 02:42:32.676
THINGS TOO AND SO I'M SURE EACH

02:42:32.742 --> 02:42:34.511
TRIBE. MAY WANT TO DO THINGS A

02:42:34.578 --> 02:42:36.613
LITTLE DIFFERENTLY- BUT THAT

02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:38.115
SAYS THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF

02:42:38.181 --> 02:42:39.983
THINGS THAT COULD BE DISCUSSED

02:42:40.050 --> 02:42:42.018
FURTHER. IF WE'RE GOING TO

02:42:42.085 --> 02:42:44.321
EXPAND- CULTURAL BURNING IN

02:42:44.387 --> 02:42:46.356
CALIFORNIA DO YOU FEEL THAT.

02:42:46.423 --> 02:42:48.158
SORT OF THE KNOWLEDGE BASES

02:42:48.225 --> 02:42:49.159
THERE WITHIN THE INDIGENOUS

02:42:49.226 --> 02:42:52.162
COMMUNITY- OR DO YOU THINK THAT

02:42:52.229 --> 02:42:52.929
BEFORE WE DID THAT WE'D HAVE

02:42:52.996 --> 02:42:55.765
TO. KIND OF DO SOME PREPARATION

02:42:55.832 --> 02:43:03.006
IN SOME PLACES. FROM THE

02:43:03.073 --> 02:43:05.142
KNOWLEDGE BASE IS PRESIDENT IN

02:43:05.208 --> 02:43:07.010
INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES

02:43:07.077 --> 02:43:09.112
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO FIND THE

02:43:09.179 --> 02:43:11.648
PERSON TOOK TO PULL IT PULL IT

02:43:11.715 --> 02:43:14.618
OUT OF OR THE ORGANIZATION- TO

02:43:14.684 --> 02:43:17.120
BE- TAKING THE POINT OF THE

02:43:17.187 --> 02:43:19.356
INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES ARE

02:43:19.422 --> 02:43:20.323
REALLY WANTING TO MAKE THIS

02:43:20.390 --> 02:43:22.425
HAPPEN ARE ARE REALLY LETTING

02:43:22.492 --> 02:43:24.261
THEMSELVES KNOWN AND THERE ARE

02:43:24.327 --> 02:43:25.495
THERE ARE QUITE A FEW OUT

02:43:25.562 --> 02:43:28.765
THERE. I THINK THAT ARE READY

02:43:28.832 --> 02:43:31.635
TO BEGIN TO DEMONSTRATE HOW

02:43:31.701 --> 02:43:33.737
THIS CAN BE DONE I'VE BEEN

02:43:33.803 --> 02:43:36.106
ACTUALLY- TALKING WITH SOME

02:43:36.173 --> 02:43:37.807
FOLKS THAT MAY BE ABLE TO HELP

02:43:37.874 --> 02:43:40.744
WITH SOME OF THIS- SPECIFICALLY

02:43:40.810 --> 02:43:44.381
AROUND- THE UC SYSTEM. AND I'VE

02:43:44.447 --> 02:43:46.483
LEARNED TO THAT THE UC SYSTEM

02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:49.686
IS ACTUALLY A COMPONENT OF THE

02:43:49.753 --> 02:43:51.288
STATE GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE

02:43:51.354 --> 02:43:53.156
CONSTITUTION. I HAVEN'T

02:43:53.223 --> 02:43:56.459
RESEARCH- THAT VERY VERY DEEPLY

02:43:56.526 --> 02:43:58.895
YET BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME

02:43:58.962 --> 02:44:01.865
COMMON INTERESTS. I'M AROUND-

02:44:01.932 --> 02:44:03.099
THE AGRICULTURAL MECHANICAL

02:44:03.166 --> 02:44:06.069
ARTS AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

02:44:06.136 --> 02:44:08.205
ACTIVITIES- THE THAT WE'RE

02:44:08.271 --> 02:44:10.140
GOING TO HAVE TO ENGAGE IN IN

02:44:10.207 --> 02:44:12.475
THE BLENDING OF. OF OUR

02:44:12.542 --> 02:44:13.810
INDIGENOUS AND WESTERN

02:44:13.877 --> 02:44:16.046
SCIENCES- TO OVERCOME OUR

02:44:16.112 --> 02:44:18.148
CURRENT OBSTACLES. THERE'S A

02:44:18.215 --> 02:44:20.951
PATHWAY THERE MAY NOT EVEN TAKE

02:44:21.017 --> 02:44:24.554
ANY LEGISLATIVE- FUNDING ANY

02:44:24.621 --> 02:44:28.291
NEW MONEY YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN

02:44:28.358 --> 02:44:30.527
TALKING WITH SOME OF THE FOLKS-

02:44:30.594 --> 02:44:32.562
IN THE UC SYSTEM ABOUT SOME OF

02:44:32.629 --> 02:44:34.864
ITS POTENTIAL AND HAVE BEEN HIT

02:44:34.931 --> 02:44:36.766
THERE'S BEEN SOME INDICATION.

02:44:36.833 --> 02:44:40.003
THAT YOU KNOW IF THE ENABLING

02:44:40.070 --> 02:44:43.406
CONDITIONS WERE SET UP. AND A

02:44:43.473 --> 02:44:45.809
BROAD LEVEL OF SUPPORT FROM THE

02:44:45.875 --> 02:44:48.678
TRIBAL. CONSTITUENCY CAME

02:44:48.745 --> 02:44:51.314
FORWARD TO SAY- YES WE WOULD

02:44:51.381 --> 02:44:55.385
LIKE TO DO- TAKE 1% OF- THE

02:44:55.452 --> 02:44:57.053
REVENUE GENERATED BY THE UC

02:44:57.120 --> 02:45:00.123
ENDOWMENT. AND INVEST IT IN IN

02:45:00.190 --> 02:45:01.825
THE ACTIVITIES WERE SPEAKING OF

02:45:01.891 --> 02:45:04.060
RIGHT NOW IN IN IN THREE OR

02:45:04.127 --> 02:45:06.997
FOUR INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES-

02:45:07.063 --> 02:45:08.298
TWO PILOTS SOME OF THESE THINGS.

02:45:08.365 --> 02:45:10.233
THEN THEN YOU KNOW THAT COULD

02:45:10.300 --> 02:45:12.435
THAT COULD SET UP- SOME

02:45:12.502 --> 02:45:14.838
PERMANENT FUNDING BASIS- IN

02:45:14.904 --> 02:45:16.773
AND- FOR SOME OF THESE PLACE

02:45:16.840 --> 02:45:18.975
BASED SOLUTIONS. SOME FAIRLY

02:45:19.042 --> 02:45:22.912
QUICKLY IT SOUNDS LIKE IT

02:45:22.979 --> 02:45:25.181
DOESN'T EVEN TAKE A LEGISLATIVE

02:45:25.248 --> 02:45:27.751
ACTION FOR UC SYSTEM TO MAKE A

02:45:27.817 --> 02:45:30.053
DECISION IN THAT CONTEXT BUT

02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:32.689
WHEN YOU DID READ THE MORAL ACT

02:45:32.756 --> 02:45:40.263
THAT CREATED THE LAND. THE. THE

02:45:40.330 --> 02:45:44.067
SYSTEMS OF THE LAND. I CAN'T

02:45:44.134 --> 02:45:45.902
MEMBER TAKE ON THE LAND BASED

02:45:45.969 --> 02:45:51.174
UNIVERSITIES AND- IT SAYS THAT.

02:45:51.241 --> 02:45:54.110
THAT IT'S UP TO THE STATE

02:45:54.177 --> 02:45:55.945
LEGISLATURE TO DECIDE WHAT KIND

02:45:56.012 --> 02:45:57.981
OF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS CAN BE

02:45:58.048 --> 02:46:00.617
ESTABLISHED AND SO IT MAY ONLY

02:46:00.684 --> 02:46:02.619
TAKE AS MUCH AS SOME

02:46:02.686 --> 02:46:04.187
ENCOURAGEMENT BY THE ROAD

02:46:04.254 --> 02:46:05.955
LEGISLATURE OR MAYBE EVEN AN

02:46:06.022 --> 02:46:08.058
AUTHORITY TO DONATE TO A

02:46:08.124 --> 02:46:09.893
TRIBALLY DRIVEN ENDOWMENT FUND

02:46:09.959 --> 02:46:11.561
OF FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN

02:46:11.628 --> 02:46:12.929
THE MECHANIC THEIR CULTURAL

02:46:12.996 --> 02:46:17.400
MECHANICAL ARTS- TO REALLY MOVE

02:46:17.467 --> 02:46:19.302
THE NEEDLE IN GETTING US THERE.

02:46:19.369 --> 02:46:21.438
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M GOING

02:46:21.504 --> 02:46:23.773
TO MOVE ON- TO MARGOT TO ASK A

02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:26.976
QUESTION SHE STILL THERE- WHICH

02:46:27.043 --> 02:46:28.845
IS A SIMILAR QUESTION ABOUT WE

02:46:28.912 --> 02:46:30.513
USE THAT YOU THINK THE STATE

02:46:30.580 --> 02:46:33.116
COULD PARTNER- WITH YOUR TRIBE

02:46:33.183 --> 02:46:36.152
OF A BIT BETTER TO. TO EXPAND

02:46:36.219 --> 02:46:38.355
TO OTHER CULTURAL BRANDS BOTH

02:46:38.421 --> 02:46:44.027
WITH YOU IN OTHER COMMUNITIES.

02:46:44.094 --> 02:46:48.098
THERE ARE SOME SOME BARRIERS

02:46:48.164 --> 02:46:51.968
REGARDING PERMITTING AND THE

02:46:52.035 --> 02:46:55.271
YUROK TRIBE ACTUALLY HAS AND-

02:46:55.338 --> 02:46:59.843
IN AIR AIR QUALITY DIVISION.

02:46:59.909 --> 02:47:02.312
AND ONE WE DO BURNSWE'RE

02:47:02.379 --> 02:47:05.014
ACTUALLY GET A PERMIT FROM THE

02:47:05.081 --> 02:47:07.417
TRIBE AS WELL AS THE NORTH

02:47:07.484 --> 02:47:10.019
COAST AIR QUALITY. AND SO THE

02:47:10.086 --> 02:47:14.624
TRIBE IS SET UP TO- TO FULLY.

02:47:14.691 --> 02:47:16.393
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE AIR

02:47:16.459 --> 02:47:18.862
QUALITY PARK AND SO THAT WOULD

02:47:18.928 --> 02:47:21.264
BE THAT WOULD BE ONE THING THAT

02:47:21.331 --> 02:47:23.466
WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR THEM TO

02:47:23.533 --> 02:47:25.402
TAKE THAT OVER THE OTHER THING

02:47:25.468 --> 02:47:30.707
THAT- SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE SINCE

02:47:30.774 --> 02:47:33.977
THE SEQUEL A PROCESS. THAT WHEN

02:47:34.043 --> 02:47:36.980
TRIBES ARE BURNING ON THEIR OWN

02:47:37.046 --> 02:47:39.682
LAND BASE THEY SHOULD BE THE

02:47:39.749 --> 02:47:43.019
ONES TO BE GIVEN THE APPROVAL

02:47:43.086 --> 02:47:44.554
FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL

02:47:44.621 --> 02:47:49.058
DOCUMENTS. THE ARE THE EXPERTS

02:47:49.125 --> 02:47:51.961
IN THAT AREA SO WHAT WOULD MAKE

02:47:52.028 --> 02:47:55.131
SENSE FOR THE STATE TO ARM TO

02:47:55.198 --> 02:47:56.099
CONSIDER TURNING THAT

02:47:56.166 --> 02:48:00.003
RESPONSIBILITY- OVER TWO TRIBES

02:48:00.069 --> 02:48:03.473
AND IF IT IS- AND MORE THAN

02:48:03.540 --> 02:48:06.676
LIKELY WOULD WOULD- ARE. BE A

02:48:06.743 --> 02:48:10.814
GOOD SUM OF MONEY TO- TO ASSUME

02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:13.416
THAT RESPONSIBILITY WITH

02:48:13.483 --> 02:48:15.251
TURNING THAT OVER WOULD ALSO

02:48:15.318 --> 02:48:18.788
COME SOME DOLLARS- I AM A YUROK

02:48:18.855 --> 02:48:20.490
TRIBAL MEMBER BUT I'M NOT PART

02:48:20.557 --> 02:48:23.293
OF THE FORMAL TRIBAL STRUCTURE.

02:48:23.359 --> 02:48:24.594
THE CULTURAL PRIOR MANAGEMENT

02:48:24.661 --> 02:48:27.363
COUNCIL IS A NON PROFIT AND SO

02:48:27.430 --> 02:48:31.267
I CAN'T LIKE REALLY SPEAK FOR

02:48:31.334 --> 02:48:33.670
THE TRIBE BUT AS AN INDIVIDUAL

02:48:33.736 --> 02:48:35.104
WHO WORKS WITH FIRE ON THE

02:48:35.171 --> 02:48:38.141
RESERVATION THOSE TWO THINGS

02:48:38.208 --> 02:48:40.677
ARE WHAT COME TO MIND. THANK

FOR YOU IS WHAT ARE THE

02:49:17.213 --> 02:49:18.915
ECOLOGICAL COAL BENEFITS A

02:49:18.982 --> 02:49:20.250
PRESCRIBED FIRE AND IF THERE'S

02:49:20.316 --> 02:49:21.584
A WAY THAT THE STATE COULD

02:49:21.651 --> 02:49:22.886
SOMEHOW BETTER VALUE WERE

02:49:22.952 --> 02:49:27.490
QUANTIFIED. THOSE BENEFITS.

02:49:27.557 --> 02:49:31.928
GREAT QUESTION SO- THERE ARE SO

02:49:31.995 --> 02:49:33.863
MANY ECOLOGICAL GO BENEFITS OF

02:49:33.930 --> 02:49:36.799
PRESCRIBED FIRE- THE FIRST ONE

02:49:36.866 --> 02:49:38.968
THAT COMES TO MIND. IS THE

02:49:39.035 --> 02:49:42.539
RECYCLING OF NUTRIENTS BACK

02:49:42.605 --> 02:49:45.041
INTO THE FOREST FLOOR- MUCH OF

02:49:45.108 --> 02:49:49.078
CALIFORNIA'S A FOREST HAVE BEEN

02:49:49.145 --> 02:49:51.981
CUT OVER AND SOME OF THE SOILS

02:49:52.048 --> 02:49:53.683
HAVE WASHED AWAY AND ARE IN THE

02:49:53.750 --> 02:49:55.685
PROCESS OF. RECOVERY THAT

02:49:55.752 --> 02:50:00.290
TAKES- DECADES- AT TIMES

02:50:00.356 --> 02:50:02.392
DEPENDING ON THE SITE-

02:50:02.458 --> 02:50:04.727
PRESCRIBED FIRE ACHIEVES TWO

02:50:04.794 --> 02:50:07.297
THINGS AT ONCE IT REMOVES THE

02:50:07.363 --> 02:50:08.698
SURFACE AND WATER FUELS AND

02:50:08.765 --> 02:50:10.533
RECYCLE THOSE NUTRIENTS RIGHT

02:50:10.600 --> 02:50:13.436
BACK INTO THE SOIL- BENEFITTING

02:50:13.503 --> 02:50:15.772
THE SMALL THINGS THAT REALLY.

02:50:15.838 --> 02:50:20.076
AREN'T RUN- NATURE- ANOTHER BIG

02:50:20.143 --> 02:50:22.512
HOPE BENEFIT OF COURSE IS A

02:50:22.579 --> 02:50:25.848
CARBON SEQUESTRATION- THAT MAY

02:50:25.915 --> 02:50:28.151
BE THOUGHT OF AS MOSTLY AS A

02:50:28.217 --> 02:50:30.286
HUMAN BENEFIT WHICH IT IS FOR

02:50:30.353 --> 02:50:33.089
CLIMATE MITIGATION- BUT IT'S

02:50:33.156 --> 02:50:36.726
ALSO- AND ECOLOGICAL BENEFIT IN

02:50:36.793 --> 02:50:39.929
THAT- THE SIERRA FORESTS IN THE

02:50:39.996 --> 02:50:41.731
FOREST IN THE REDWOOD RANGE.

02:50:41.798 --> 02:50:43.633
ARE SOME OF THE MOST CARBON

02:50:43.700 --> 02:50:47.403
DENSE FORESTS ON THE PLANET- IN

02:50:47.470 --> 02:50:49.839
THEIR OLD GROWTH FORESTS- AND

02:50:49.906 --> 02:50:51.641
GET FIRED UP FOR US THAT MEANS

02:50:51.708 --> 02:50:55.244
IN THEIR FIRE RESILIENT FORM.

02:50:55.311 --> 02:50:58.681
SO WHAT WE ARE. TALKING ABOUT

02:50:58.748 --> 02:51:01.884
RECREATING IS- BY DOING THE

02:51:01.951 --> 02:51:04.053
THINGS RECOMMENDED HERE TODAY

02:51:04.120 --> 02:51:05.822
IS ONE OF THE LARGEST-

02:51:05.888 --> 02:51:08.758
TERRESTRIAL CARBON RESERVOIRS-

02:51:08.825 --> 02:51:10.360
ON THE PLANET THAT IS FAR

02:51:10.426 --> 02:51:12.695
RESILIENCE AND SUPPORTS A HIGH

02:51:12.762 --> 02:51:18.368
DEGREE OF BIODIVERSITY. WELCOME

EXPAND THE USE OF FIRE ON ITS

02:51:32.348 --> 02:51:34.250
LANDS AFTER SHAVER LAKE IF

THE CREEK FIRE- CHANGED OUR

02:51:45.762 --> 02:51:47.764
GOAL ON OUR LAND THAT THE

02:51:47.830 --> 02:51:48.898
QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU'RE

02:51:48.965 --> 02:51:50.333
GOING TO BE CHANGING ANY OF

02:51:50.400 --> 02:51:51.668
YOUR PROGRAM TO INCREASE

02:51:51.734 --> 02:51:54.504
PRESCRIBED FIRE OR CHANGE HOW

02:51:54.570 --> 02:51:57.740
YOU DO IT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

02:51:57.807 --> 02:51:58.941
WELL IF ANYTHING IT WOULD

02:51:59.008 --> 02:52:01.911
MOTIVATE US TO. INCREASE THE

02:52:01.978 --> 02:52:05.114
AMOUNT OF DEBT MANAGEMENT AND-

02:52:05.181 --> 02:52:06.082
THE AMOUNT OF PRESCRIBED

02:52:06.149 --> 02:52:07.283
BURNING THAT WE DO ON OUR

02:52:07.350 --> 02:52:09.919
LANDS- IN YEARS PAST WE HAVE

02:52:09.986 --> 02:52:11.754
HAD A GOAL OF TRYING TO GET.

02:52:11.821 --> 02:52:13.690
ABOUT A THOUSAND ACRES PER YEAR

02:52:13.756 --> 02:52:15.825
ON OUR TWENTY THOUSAND ACRES WE

02:52:15.892 --> 02:52:17.694
WOULD LOVE TO HEAR. TWO

02:52:17.760 --> 02:52:19.629
THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR BUT- A

02:52:19.696 --> 02:52:21.064
VARIETY OF THINGS AND READ

02:52:21.130 --> 02:52:23.466
MAINLY REGULATIONS- SLOW THAT

02:52:23.533 --> 02:52:25.768
DOWN AND KEEP US FROM ACHIEVING

02:52:25.835 --> 02:52:28.371
THAT BUT WE HAVE- CREATED A

02:52:28.438 --> 02:52:29.939
VERY GOOD PARTNERSHIP WITH CAL

02:52:30.006 --> 02:52:30.973
FIRE DURING THE PAST FIVE

02:52:31.040 --> 02:52:33.042
YEARS. AND I THINK THEY'RE

02:52:33.109 --> 02:52:34.610
GOING TO HELP BUT- AT TIMES

02:52:34.677 --> 02:52:36.045
THEY COME ON OUR LAND. WILL

02:52:36.112 --> 02:52:37.914
BURN TOGETHER THEY'LL BURN ONE

02:52:37.980 --> 02:52:39.582
UNIT- MY STAFF WILL BURN

02:52:39.649 --> 02:52:41.184
ANOTHER UNIT AND SO I THINK

02:52:41.250 --> 02:52:43.419
THAT'S GONNA ALLOW US TO RAMP

02:52:43.486 --> 02:52:46.723
UP- THE AMOUNT OF ACREAGE THAT

02:52:46.789 --> 02:52:49.025
WE CONDUCT PRESCRIBED BURNS ON.

02:52:49.092 --> 02:52:51.728
GENERALLY SPEAKING THOUGH NO WE

02:52:51.794 --> 02:52:53.629
WERE ALWAYS TRYING TO RESTORE

02:52:53.696 --> 02:52:56.399
OUR POOREST. BACK TO A NATURAL

02:56:04.353 --> 02:56:06.055
HIM BETTER PART OF A COUPLE

02:56:06.122 --> 02:56:07.456
DECADES NOW ON VERY SMALL

02:56:07.523 --> 02:56:10.226
SCALES. MMHM BUT YOU KNOW

02:56:10.293 --> 02:56:12.161
RECENTLY WITH OUR KAMATH RIVER

02:56:12.228 --> 02:56:13.930
OF PRESCRIBED FIRE TRAINING

02:56:13.996 --> 02:56:16.132
EXCHANGE ACTIVITIES. MMHM WE'VE

02:56:16.198 --> 02:56:20.403
REALLY SCALED UP. THAT ACTIVITY

02:56:20.469 --> 02:56:23.172
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH STATE- WE

02:56:23.239 --> 02:56:25.274
STILL ARE TO THAT POINT TO

02:56:25.341 --> 02:56:27.276
WHERE- WE'RE GETTING ANY

02:56:27.343 --> 02:56:31.247
MEANINGFUL OF BURNING DONE ON

02:56:31.314 --> 02:56:31.948
THE FOR SERVICE SIDE OF THE

02:56:32.014 --> 02:56:36.919
LINE- WE STILL DON'T HAVE. ANY

02:56:36.986 --> 02:56:40.156
SIGN BURN PLANTS FROM THE VA.

02:56:40.222 --> 02:56:41.290
AND SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE

02:56:41.357 --> 02:56:44.660
TROUBLED TRUST PARCELS AND THE

02:56:44.727 --> 02:56:48.230
NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM LANDS-

02:56:48.297 --> 02:56:51.133
WE'RE JUST NOT GETTING THERE.

02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:51.667
WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF PRE

02:56:51.734 --> 02:56:54.036

OF PILES. WERE EVEN CHALLENGE

02:56:59.008 --> 02:57:03.713
BURNING THOSE FILES- BUT- AND

02:57:03.779 --> 02:57:05.915
WHEN THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:57:05.982 --> 02:57:08.451
SEND SOME SOME TREES- YOU KNOW

02:57:08.517 --> 02:57:09.652
THAT THAT ALWAYS SEEMS TO

02:57:09.719 --> 02:57:11.754
BECOME THE PRIORITY. BUT YOU

02:57:11.821 --> 02:57:13.756
KNOW THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR IN

02:57:13.823 --> 02:57:14.357
THE TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE IS

02:57:14.423 --> 02:57:16.859
CLEAR IT NEEDS TO BE ABOUT

02:57:16.926 --> 02:57:18.594
GETTING THE FIRE ON THE GROUND

02:57:18.661 --> 02:57:22.264
EVEN WHEN YOU DO THOSE THINGS

02:57:22.331 --> 02:57:22.832

CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE HAVING

02:57:28.671 --> 02:57:30.673
IS A STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING

02:57:30.740 --> 02:57:32.208
TO BE ABLE TO PUSH FOR THESE

02:57:32.274 --> 02:57:33.676
ACTIVITIES SENSE. THAT THAT'S

02:57:33.743 --> 02:57:41.017
CORRECT. YES WE'VE BEEN YOU

KNOW LUCKY ENOUGH TO. TO

02:57:44.320 --> 02:57:46.489
RECEIVE SOME THREE YEAR GRANTS-

02:57:46.555 --> 02:57:49.358
TO BUILD SOME CAPACITY- BUT-

02:57:49.425 --> 02:57:53.029
THOSE THREE YEAR GRANTS- ARE

02:57:53.095 --> 02:57:56.332
COMING TO THEIR HAND- AND YOU

02:57:56.399 --> 02:57:57.500
KNOW WE'RE WE'RE ON THE VERGE

02:57:57.566 --> 02:57:59.135
OF LOSING A LOT OF OUR- OUR

02:57:59.201 --> 02:58:01.170
BILL TO PASS CITY IN. AND SO

02:58:01.237 --> 02:58:03.172
WERE WERE YOU KNOW OF COURSE IN

02:58:03.239 --> 02:58:05.241
THE SHORT TERM GONNA GONNA TRY

02:58:05.307 --> 02:58:08.544
TO TRY TO- SUSTAIN WHAT WE CAN.

02:58:08.611 --> 02:58:10.813
BY SUBMITTING SOME RATS BUT

02:58:10.880 --> 02:58:13.716
ULTIMATELY- THESE THINGS KIND

02:58:13.783 --> 02:58:16.385
OF KIND OF NEED TO HAVE

02:58:16.452 --> 02:58:18.888
SUSTAINABLE SOURCES- BECAUSE IF

02:58:18.954 --> 02:58:20.456
YOU DON'T MAINTAIN THEM YOUR

02:58:20.523 --> 02:58:23.793
INITIAL INVESTMENT IS JUST A

02:58:23.859 --> 02:58:24.727
WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. THANK

02:58:24.794 --> 02:58:26.462
YOU AND HOW HOW MANY ACRES

02:58:26.529 --> 02:58:29.365
ALTOGETHER- ARE CONSIDERED

02:58:29.432 --> 02:58:31.267
COULD PROVE. HOW TRIBAL LAND

02:58:31.333 --> 02:58:38.541
RIGHT NOW. ROUGHLY HOME I DON'T

02:58:38.607 --> 02:58:40.443
HAVE THE EXACT IT OCCURRED TO

02:58:40.509 --> 02:58:42.645
US THAT ARE CONSIDERED GROUP

02:58:42.711 --> 02:58:46.682
TRIBAL LAND IT'S YOU KNOW IN

02:58:46.749 --> 02:58:48.551
THE LOW THOUSANDS IF NOT

02:58:48.617 --> 02:58:51.187
HUNDREDS TWO THOUSAND. BUT AND

02:58:51.253 --> 02:58:55.024
IS SPREAD ACROSS YOU KNOW.

02:58:55.091 --> 02:58:58.894
MILLIONS OF ACRES AND SO-

02:58:58.961 --> 02:58:59.995
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO

02:59:00.062 --> 02:59:01.163
GETTING TO THE POINT OF TRIBAL

02:59:01.230 --> 02:59:02.565
SOVEREIGNTY IN RECOGNIZING

02:59:02.631 --> 02:59:04.800
TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY IS BECAUSE

02:59:04.867 --> 02:59:10.306
OUR CONSTITUTION- THAT-ESTABLISHES OUR TRIBAL

02:59:10.372 --> 02:59:12.575
GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS. SOME SHOWS

02:59:12.641 --> 02:59:15.744
THAT ARE JURISDICTION- OVER US

02:59:15.811 --> 02:59:18.447
SUCH THINGS SUCH AS ECOLOGICAL

02:59:18.514 --> 02:59:21.417
PROCESS AND FUNCTION. SOME ARE

02:59:21.484 --> 02:59:24.153
HARD TO FIND TO BE APPLICABLE

02:59:24.220 --> 02:59:26.522
AT THE TERRITORIAL SCALE AND SO

02:59:26.589 --> 02:59:29.325
WE REALLY ARE LOOKING AT HAVING

02:59:29.391 --> 02:59:31.594
AN OVERLAPPING JURISDICTION

02:59:31.660 --> 02:59:33.596
BASED ON OUR CONSTITUTION SAYS

02:59:33.662 --> 02:59:35.731
AND THAT'S THE SKILL WE OPERATE

02:59:35.798 --> 02:59:38.300
UNDER- WITH OUR DEPARTMENT AND

02:59:38.367 --> 02:59:40.169
THAT'S RESOURCES OKAY GREAT

NOBODY HAS HIT UPON THAT- I'VE

03:00:13.536 --> 03:00:15.471
MET EXPERIENCE WITH THE- MY-

03:00:15.538 --> 03:00:17.273
FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER DOLLY NOW

03:00:17.339 --> 03:00:20.976
SENATOR DOLLY- VISITING. HIS

03:00:21.043 --> 03:00:23.779

03:00:23.846 --> 03:00:27.183
TIMES ACTUALLY ON ON TRIPS OUT

03:00:27.249 --> 03:00:29.885
INTO THE FOREST. THE VALUE TO

03:00:29.952 --> 03:00:31.587
OUR WATERSHEDS OF THESE

03:00:31.654 --> 03:00:33.756
PRESCRIBED BURNS OVER THE LONG

03:00:33.822 --> 03:00:35.524
HAUL AND BY THAT I MEAN.

03:00:35.591 --> 03:00:37.359
COMBINED WITH THE PRETREATMENT

03:00:37.426 --> 03:00:39.161
OF THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

03:00:39.228 --> 03:00:41.096
AND THEN THE PRESCRIBED BURN.

03:00:41.163 --> 03:00:43.832
ALL THAT VEGETATION THAT IS

03:00:43.899 --> 03:00:46.535
OVERGROWN THOSE INDIVIDUAL

03:00:46.602 --> 03:00:49.505
STRAWS IN THE GROUND. THE FACT

03:00:49.572 --> 03:00:51.507
THEY ALL DRAW WATER. AND THEY

03:00:51.574 --> 03:00:53.709
AFFECT THE ABILITY OF

03:00:53.776 --> 03:00:57.179
WATERSHEDS TO BE HEALTHY- IS

03:00:57.246 --> 03:00:58.814
YOU KNOW IT NATURE CONSERVANCY

RESEARCH INTO. THE VALUE OF THE

03:01:08.157 --> 03:01:10.793
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ON ON

03:01:10.859 --> 03:01:11.327
WATER SUPPLY AND WATERSHED

03:01:11.393 --> 03:01:15.030
HEALTH. WE HAVE THANK YOU FOR

03:01:15.097 --> 03:01:17.466
THE QUESTION- SO I THINK IT

WAS- YOUR PREVIOUS COMMENT. IT

03:01:22.871 --> 03:01:24.073
DOES IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK

03:01:24.139 --> 03:01:26.175
RELEVANT HERE I DOLLARS AND

03:01:26.242 --> 03:01:29.778
PREVENTION- TO GET A GREAT TO

FIREFIGHTING AND RECOVERY-

03:01:38.554 --> 03:01:42.658
EFFORTS AND- THAT. THAT IDEA IS

03:01:42.725 --> 03:01:44.293
EMBODIED IN A STUDY THAT WE

03:01:44.360 --> 03:01:45.761
COMPLETED SEVERAL YEARS AGO

03:01:45.828 --> 03:01:48.163
WITH SOME PARTNERS CALLED THE

COLONY OF WAITED COST STUDY-

03:01:52.434 --> 03:01:53.969
WHERE. A SERIES OF AUTHORS

03:01:54.036 --> 03:01:57.706
QUANTIFIED- THE AVOIDED COSTS

03:01:57.773 --> 03:02:01.210
OF. HOW HIGH INTENSITY

03:02:01.277 --> 03:02:04.346
WILDFIRES- BY VIRTUE OF THE

03:02:04.413 --> 03:02:06.148
PREVENTATIVE WORK THAT THAT

03:02:06.215 --> 03:02:10.953
COULD BE DONE. TO THE QUESTION

03:02:11.020 --> 03:02:14.390
OF- WATER BENEFITS IN A NUMBER

03:02:14.456 --> 03:02:17.293
OF- STUDIES- DONE ALONG THOSE

03:02:17.359 --> 03:02:19.795
LINES SOME BY US. A LEADER IN

03:02:19.862 --> 03:02:22.031
THIS FIELD IS YOU SEE SAID THE

03:02:22.097 --> 03:02:26.201
WORK OF DR ROGER BALES- WHO IS

03:02:26.268 --> 03:02:27.069
PART OF OUR FRENCH MEADOWS

03:02:27.136 --> 03:02:29.738
PARTNERSHIP- THE WATER CYCLE

03:02:29.805 --> 03:02:32.174
ITSELF IS COMPLICATED ARE

03:02:32.241 --> 03:02:33.842
PREDICTING WATER YIELD IN

03:02:33.909 --> 03:02:35.210
RELATION TO FOREST MANAGEMENT

03:02:35.277 --> 03:02:38.213
EVEN MORE SO. THERE DOES SEEM

03:02:38.280 --> 03:02:40.382
TO BE SOME. DOMINO GAINES AND

03:02:40.449 --> 03:02:44.153
WATER YIELD ASSOCIATED WITH-

03:02:44.219 --> 03:02:45.754
ANY BUT I THINK FURTHER STUDY

03:02:45.821 --> 03:02:48.791
IS NEEDED- AND I'D I'D REFER

03:02:48.857 --> 03:02:50.726

HYDROLOGISTS WHO ARE FAR MORE

03:02:52.428 --> 03:02:54.530
QUALIFIED THAN I AM- BUT

03:02:54.596 --> 03:02:57.199
CERTAINLY- THE WATERSHED

03:02:57.266 --> 03:02:59.468
BENEFITS OVERALL. IN TERMS OF

03:02:59.535 --> 03:03:01.837
AVOIDING- HIGH INTENSITY

03:03:01.904 --> 03:03:05.541
WILDFIRES THAT RESULT IN A

03:03:05.607 --> 03:03:07.309
HIGHLY RUNNABLE SOILS. CLOGGING

03:03:07.376 --> 03:03:08.811
UP RESERVOIRS FOR YEARS AND

03:03:08.877 --> 03:03:10.746
ADDING TO THEIR ANNUAL

03:03:10.813 --> 03:03:12.881
MAINTENANCE COSTS- ALONG WITH

03:03:12.948 --> 03:03:14.783
IMPACTS TO THREATENED AND

03:03:14.850 --> 03:03:16.985
ENDANGERED SPECIES LIKE- VERY

03:03:17.052 --> 03:03:18.520
SOME FABIAN SPECIES THE RELYING

03:03:18.587 --> 03:03:22.257
CLEAN COLD WATER- ALL ADD UP.

03:03:22.324 --> 03:03:28.163

A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

03:03:45.013 --> 03:03:47.750
KIND OF PARTNERSHIPS AND I WAS

03:03:47.816 --> 03:03:48.250
JUST CURIOUS FROM YOUR

03:03:48.317 --> 03:03:49.985
PERSPECTIVE EVERY YEAR

03:03:50.052 --> 03:03:50.853
UTILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO

03:03:50.919 --> 03:03:53.789
SUBMIT TO THE CQC VEGETATION

03:03:53.856 --> 03:03:55.891
MANAGEMENT PLAN HOW CAN- STATE

03:03:55.958 --> 03:03:57.126
AGENCIES AND WHAT ARE SOME OF

03:03:57.192 --> 03:03:58.160
THE HANG UPS WITH STATED SHE'S

03:03:58.227 --> 03:03:59.962
ON PARTNERING WITH UTILITIES TO

03:04:00.028 --> 03:04:03.265
ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS TO MAKE-

03:04:03.332 --> 03:04:03.832
MAKE IT A PRIORITY ON STATE

03:04:03.899 --> 03:04:10.038
LANDS. CAN YOU CLARIFY STATE

03:04:10.105 --> 03:04:11.373
LANDS WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING

03:04:11.440 --> 03:04:14.543
SPECIFICALLY PRIVATE PLANS OR-

03:04:14.610 --> 03:04:14.977
THOSE WITHIN COUNTY

03:04:15.043 --> 03:04:17.146
JURISDICTION. CERTAINLY NOT

03:04:17.212 --> 03:04:18.347
PRIVATE I THINK BY BILLIONS AS

03:04:18.414 --> 03:04:20.115
ITS OWN SEPARATE YOU KNOW ISSUE

03:04:20.182 --> 03:04:22.117
BUT WAS FAR AS LIKE THE STATE

03:04:22.184 --> 03:04:24.686
RESPONSE AREA- AS IT RUNS INTO

03:04:24.753 --> 03:04:27.222
YOU KNOW- LOCALIZED URBAN

03:04:27.289 --> 03:04:29.258
INTERFACE BUT STATE RESPONSE

03:04:29.324 --> 03:04:32.861
HERE IT PRIMARILY. OKAY SO I

03:04:32.928 --> 03:04:34.296
THINK WHAT YOU'RE TOUCHING ON

03:04:34.363 --> 03:04:38.300
IS- THE IDEA AND THE NEED AT

03:04:38.367 --> 03:04:40.636
THE END IT'S A BIG NEED FOR-

03:04:40.702 --> 03:04:43.138
CROSS JURISDICTIONAL- PLANNING

03:04:43.205 --> 03:04:44.506
AND IMPLEMENTATION WOULD THAT

03:04:44.573 --> 03:04:47.242
BE CORRECT. CERTAINLY YES BUT

03:04:47.309 --> 03:04:49.745
IT IS. WHEN YOU APPLY FOR A

03:04:49.812 --> 03:04:50.879
PERMIT SAY WHETHER IT'S

03:04:50.946 --> 03:04:52.714
WHATEVER UTILITY THEY WANT TO

03:04:52.781 --> 03:04:55.184
DO SOMETHING. THERE TENDS TO BE

03:04:55.250 --> 03:04:56.852
A HANG UP WITH STATE AGENCIES

03:04:56.919 --> 03:04:58.253
ON THOSE PERMITTING BECAUSE

03:04:58.320 --> 03:04:59.288
THEY GO THROUGH MULTIPLE

03:04:59.354 --> 03:05:00.989
AGENCIES MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS

03:05:01.056 --> 03:05:02.424
AND BY THE TIME THAT WE GET ALL

03:05:02.491 --> 03:05:04.326
OF THIS DONE. WERE EITHER OUT

03:05:04.393 --> 03:05:05.828
OF THE SEASON OR I MEAN WE FOR

03:05:05.894 --> 03:05:06.995
THE TRIBAL MEMBERS TALK ABOUT

03:05:07.062 --> 03:05:08.497
IT WE JUST RAN OUT OF TIME TO

03:05:08.564 --> 03:05:10.199
DO THIS SO IS THERE A WAY IN

03:05:10.265 --> 03:05:11.467
YOUR MIND WE COULD STREAMLINE

03:05:11.533 --> 03:05:13.569
SOME OF THAT SO WHEN UTILITIES

03:05:13.635 --> 03:05:15.671
OR TRIBE IS WANTING TO DO THESE

03:05:15.737 --> 03:05:16.872
THINGS- TILE SEQUENCE INCHES

03:05:16.939 --> 03:05:18.373
IN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. WHAT

03:05:18.440 --> 03:05:20.042
CAN WE DO TO STREAMLINE THAT AT

03:05:20.108 --> 03:05:22.144
THE STATE LEVEL WITHIN THE

03:05:22.211 --> 03:05:27.149
STATE AGENCIES. OKAY GOT IT SO

03:05:27.216 --> 03:05:32.821
I THINK THAT. EXEMPTIONS ARE IN

03:05:32.888 --> 03:05:35.057
AND OF THEMSELVES- BUT IT TOOL

03:05:35.123 --> 03:05:37.459
IN SOME SITUATIONS- YOU MAY BE

03:05:37.526 --> 03:05:41.029
AWARE THAT WITH SB NINE A ONE-

03:05:41.096 --> 03:05:45.334
IF A FUELS MANAGEMENT- ACTIVITY

03:05:45.400 --> 03:05:47.436
IS ALREADY COVERED BY NEPA ON

03:05:47.503 --> 03:05:49.104
FEDERAL LANDS NATIONAL FIREMEN

03:05:49.171 --> 03:05:52.708
ALL POLICY ACT THEN- THOSE SAME

03:05:52.774 --> 03:05:54.543
PROJECTS CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS

03:05:54.610 --> 03:05:56.712
EXEMPTED FROM SEQUEL HAVING

03:05:56.778 --> 03:05:58.413
ALREADY GONE THROUGH AN

03:05:58.480 --> 03:06:00.649
ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION FOR

03:06:00.716 --> 03:06:02.351
THE FEDERAL PROCESS SO. THAT

03:06:02.417 --> 03:06:03.719
THOSE KIND OF EXEMPTIONS WORK

03:06:03.785 --> 03:06:06.488
WELL WHEREVER YOU'RE- TAKING A

03:06:06.555 --> 03:06:07.890
LOOK AT AND REMOVING-

03:06:07.956 --> 03:06:11.260
REDUNDANCIES IN THE SYSTEM- I

03:06:11.326 --> 03:06:14.563
THINK YOU KNOW TO DIRECTOR

03:06:14.630 --> 03:06:18.000
PORTERS- PREVIOUS COMMENT. IT

03:06:18.066 --> 03:06:19.468
THEY'RE ARE A LOT OF RESOURCES

03:06:19.535 --> 03:06:22.404
OUT THERE THAT NEED TO BE KNOWN

03:06:22.471 --> 03:06:26.141
IT AND DISCLOSED- BEFORE

03:06:26.208 --> 03:06:28.210
ASSERTING THAT THERE IS NO

03:06:28.277 --> 03:06:30.746
HARM- CERTAINLY THERE ARE WAYS

03:06:30.812 --> 03:06:33.348
ON THE GROUND THAT CAN BE. USED

03:06:33.415 --> 03:06:34.583
TO MAKE THAT PROCESS MORE

03:06:34.650 --> 03:06:37.753
EFFICIENT- BUT I THINK FRANKLY

03:06:37.819 --> 03:06:39.288
WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS

03:06:39.354 --> 03:06:40.022
FORMING THOSE CROSS

03:06:40.088 --> 03:06:42.891
JURISDICTIONAL PARTNERSHIPS- WE

03:06:42.958 --> 03:06:44.192
HAVE A VERY SUCCESSFUL ONE FOR

03:06:44.259 --> 03:06:46.028
EXAMPLE WITH THE PLASTER COUNTY

03:06:46.094 --> 03:06:49.064
WATER AGENCY. PLASTER COUNTY

03:06:49.131 --> 03:06:50.265
THE US FOREST SERVICE

03:06:50.332 --> 03:06:52.167
KALIFORNIA SEVERAL OTHER

03:06:52.234 --> 03:06:54.102
PARTNERS WHERE WE SIT DOWN

03:06:54.169 --> 03:06:57.372
AHEAD OF TIME DEFINE OUR GOALS.

03:06:57.439 --> 03:06:59.308
RAISE FUNDS FOR THOSE GOALS.

03:06:59.374 --> 03:07:01.209
SHEPHERDED FIREMAN ALL

03:07:01.276 --> 03:07:04.546
PERMITTING. AWESOME SO THAT

03:07:04.613 --> 03:07:06.114
WERE FULLY AWARE OF WHAT'S

03:07:06.181 --> 03:07:08.050
AVAILABLE- IN TERMS OF NATURAL

03:07:08.116 --> 03:07:10.719
CULTURE RESOURCE OUT THERE- AS

03:07:10.786 --> 03:07:12.588
WE GET INTO FUNDING PROJECTS

03:07:12.654 --> 03:07:14.656
AND BY DOING THAT WE END UP

03:07:14.723 --> 03:07:17.326
AVOIDING UP MOST NOT ALL BUT

03:07:17.392 --> 03:07:19.094
MOST OF THE DELAYS THAT THAT-

03:07:19.161 --> 03:07:21.663
FOLKS EXPERIENCE BUT IT IS A

03:07:21.730 --> 03:07:23.532
VERY RESOURCE INTENSIVE PROCESS.

03:07:23.599 --> 03:07:24.733
NO ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE I THINK I

03:07:24.800 --> 03:07:25.767
MEAN IN THIS ENTIRE HEARING

03:07:25.834 --> 03:07:27.069
TODAY WE'VE WE'VE HEARD THE

03:07:27.135 --> 03:07:30.238
IMPORTANCE OF USING. FIRE AS A

03:07:30.305 --> 03:07:32.040
TOOL TO RESTRICT USE OUR

03:07:32.107 --> 03:07:33.275
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AS YOU

03:07:33.342 --> 03:07:34.776
WELL KNOW YOU KNOW THERE'S

03:07:34.843 --> 03:07:36.945
THREE THINGS TO SUSTAIN FIRE IT

03:07:37.012 --> 03:07:38.914
OXYGEN FUEL AND IGNITION RIGHT.

03:07:38.981 --> 03:07:39.648
THE ONLY THING WE'RE TALKING

03:07:39.715 --> 03:07:41.650
ABOUT IS REDUCING THE FUEL LOAD

03:07:41.717 --> 03:07:42.484
AND FIRE IS A VERY IMPORTANT

03:07:42.551 --> 03:07:44.319
PART OF THAT. AND I THINK IT'S

03:07:44.386 --> 03:07:46.722
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

03:07:46.788 --> 03:07:48.390
USE OUR TRIBAL FRIENDS- TO GET

03:07:48.457 --> 03:07:50.692
THIS THING MOVING FORWARD. BUT

03:07:50.759 --> 03:07:52.594
IF IT IS GOOD ON TRIBAL LAND.

03:07:52.661 --> 03:07:53.996
IT SHOULD BE GOOD FOR THE

03:07:54.062 --> 03:07:56.498
ENTIRE FOR SYSTEM. AND SO I

03:07:56.565 --> 03:07:57.099
THINK IT'S WE'RE HAVING THESE

03:07:57.165 --> 03:08:00.035
CONVERSATIONS. HOW DO WE ALLOW

03:08:00.102 --> 03:08:00.769
PRIVATE INDUSTRIES PRIVATE

03:08:00.836 --> 03:08:05.540
ENTITIES. TO USE THE SAME.

03:08:05.607 --> 03:08:07.476
HELLO THE SAME. METHODS THAT

03:08:07.542 --> 03:08:09.544
ARE GOOD ON TRIBAL LANDS BUT

03:08:09.611 --> 03:08:10.412
CAN READ REDUCE SOME OF THOSE

03:08:10.479 --> 03:08:11.980
BARRIERS BECAUSE I FIND THAT WE

03:08:12.047 --> 03:08:14.650
GET HUNG UP- AT THE STATE LEVEL

03:08:14.716 --> 03:08:15.384
BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS THEIR

03:08:15.450 --> 03:08:17.152
JURISDICTIONS. AND NOBODY

03:08:17.219 --> 03:08:19.054
REALLY WANTS TO LIKE LET THE

03:08:19.121 --> 03:08:20.122
OTHER GUYS HANNAH COOKIE JAR

03:08:20.188 --> 03:08:21.189
RIGHT WE ALL CAN WERE VERY

03:08:21.256 --> 03:08:22.991
TERRITORIAL OF THAT. AND SO

03:08:23.058 --> 03:08:24.760
THAT IS MY FEAR IS WHERE WE ARE

03:08:24.826 --> 03:08:25.527
IDENTIFYINGTHAT THIS IS A

03:08:25.594 --> 03:08:27.996
GREAT TOOL. HOW DO WE USE IT IN

03:08:28.063 --> 03:08:29.831
TRIBAL LANDS TO BE SHORT AS

03:08:29.898 --> 03:08:30.732
WELL AS YOU KNOW MAYBE MORE

03:08:30.799 --> 03:08:32.868
PRIVATE AND PUBLIC STATE LANDS

03:08:32.934 --> 03:08:36.972
AS WELL. SO THAT'S KIND OF. MY

03:08:37.039 --> 03:08:38.073
CONCERN WITH ALL THIS. YEAH I

03:08:38.140 --> 03:08:40.575
KNOW IT'S A- COULD. AND I THINK

03:08:40.642 --> 03:08:41.710
TO THE DEGREE THAT CAN THIS

03:08:41.777 --> 03:08:43.245
WON'T BE A SIMPLE SOLUTION BUT

03:08:43.311 --> 03:08:47.115
I THINK CENTRALIZING- THE PLAN

03:08:47.182 --> 03:08:48.316
IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS

03:08:48.383 --> 03:08:50.318
STAYS- AS MUCH AS THEY CAN OR

03:08:50.385 --> 03:08:52.187
AT LEAST COORDINATING THEM

03:08:52.254 --> 03:08:54.990
WOULD BE. HELPFUL ONE ONE GROUP

03:08:55.057 --> 03:08:57.059
THAT I. MENTIONED IN MY

03:08:57.125 --> 03:08:59.461
PREVIOUS ANSWER IS. IT ARE THAT

03:08:59.528 --> 03:09:00.929
THEY ARE DISTRICTS AND

03:09:00.996 --> 03:09:03.732
CAPITOLA- THEY'VE BEEN

03:09:03.799 --> 03:09:05.701
INCREDIBLY VALUABLE PARTNERS.

03:09:05.767 --> 03:09:07.436
IN OUR IN OUR COLLABORATIVE AS

03:09:07.502 --> 03:09:11.206
WELL- AND SO IF YOU CAN TAKE

03:09:11.273 --> 03:09:12.808
THOSE FLEDGLING EFFORTS WHETHER

03:09:12.874 --> 03:09:14.042
IT BE BY THE TRIBES OR BY THE

03:09:14.109 --> 03:09:16.311
NGO COMMUNITY. AND SEE WHAT

03:09:16.378 --> 03:09:18.013
WORKS WITHIN THOSE

03:09:18.080 --> 03:09:19.681
COLLABORATIVES- I THINK YOU

03:09:19.748 --> 03:09:21.416
MIGHT HAVE THE INGREDIENTS FOR

03:09:21.483 --> 03:09:22.184
YOU KNOW SOME BROADER

03:09:22.250 --> 03:09:23.852
SYSTEMATIC CHANGE THAT YOU THAT

DIFFERENT PANELISTS IN

PARTICULAR OUR FIRM BELIEF IS

03:10:24.713 --> 03:10:28.116
THAT WITH PRESCRIBED FIRE WE

03:10:28.183 --> 03:10:29.050
REALLY HAVE TO ADDRESS BOTH.

03:10:29.117 --> 03:10:31.753
IMITATION ON LIABILITY. ABSENT

OF COURSE SOME SORT OF GROSS

03:10:33.121 --> 03:10:36.324
NEGLIGENCE. IN ORDER TO ALLOW

03:10:36.391 --> 03:10:39.227

FIRE TO SCALE. WE ALSO OF

03:10:48.336 --> 03:10:49.471
COURSE NEED TO CONTINUE

03:10:49.538 --> 03:10:51.239
THINNING EFFORTS BUT THERE ARE

03:10:51.306 --> 03:10:52.440
TWO OTHER ITEMS I WANT TO BRING

03:10:52.507 --> 03:10:54.176
TO THE- COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION

03:10:54.242 --> 03:10:56.178
MADAM CHAIR FIRST IS WE BELIEVE

03:10:56.244 --> 03:10:57.813
THAT THERE SHOULD BE ONE

03:10:57.879 --> 03:11:00.615
INDIVIDUAL IN CHARGE- DIRECTING

03:11:00.682 --> 03:11:02.384
THESE LARGE SCALE PROJECTS WITH

03:11:02.450 --> 03:11:04.486
THE GOAL OF. A HALF A MILLION

03:11:04.553 --> 03:11:07.489
ACRES A YEAR TO TREAT AND OVER

03:11:07.556 --> 03:11:09.257
THIRTY THREE MILLION- FOREST

03:11:09.324 --> 03:11:11.026
LANDS ACRES OF FOREST LAND IN

03:11:11.092 --> 03:11:12.861
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE

03:11:12.928 --> 03:11:14.162
REALLY HAVE TO HAVE A SINGLE

03:11:14.229 --> 03:11:16.064
INDIVIDUAL IN CHARGE THE OTHER

03:11:16.131 --> 03:11:17.232
THING IS WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO

03:11:17.299 --> 03:11:19.234
WITH THAT MATERIAL- WE THINK

03:11:19.301 --> 03:11:20.735
THAT YOU'VE GOT TO INVOLVE

03:11:20.802 --> 03:11:23.705
BIOMASS. YOU BASICALLY HAVE TWO

03:11:23.772 --> 03:11:24.873
OPTIONS IF YOU'RE GOING TO

03:11:24.940 --> 03:11:26.308
TREAT THAT SORT OF A LARGE

03:11:26.374 --> 03:11:30.779
SCALE NUMBER OF ACRES EITHER UP

03:11:30.846 --> 03:11:33.949
OPEN PILE BURNS FOR BIOMASS AND

03:11:34.015 --> 03:11:35.584
IF YOU BELIEVE THE PLASTER

03:11:35.650 --> 03:11:37.819
COUNTY AIRPORT STUDY. WE SEE

03:11:37.886 --> 03:11:40.455
DRAMATIC REDUCTIONS IN THE

03:11:40.522 --> 03:11:42.724
EMISSIONS PART OF OUR MATTER

03:11:42.791 --> 03:11:45.560
IT'S SEVERAL THE LAST ITEM IS

03:11:45.627 --> 03:11:47.395
I'M REMINDED OF A SAYING THAT

03:11:47.462 --> 03:11:49.064
THE CHAIRMAN OF OUR BOARD WHO

03:11:49.130 --> 03:11:51.399
HAS OFTEN MADE IT'S ACTUALLY A

03:11:51.466 --> 03:11:53.602
SIMILAR TO WHAT MISS ROBBINS

03:11:53.668 --> 03:11:54.536
SAID ON YOUR LAST PANEL SHE

03:11:54.603 --> 03:11:58.340
SAID. PEOPLE MUST CHOOSE THEIR

03:11:58.406 --> 03:12:00.041
SMOKE. AND MICHAEL THAT YOU'RE

03:12:00.108 --> 03:12:02.644
OF OUR OFTEN SAYS. WE CAN

03:12:02.711 --> 03:12:03.812
EITHER HAVE FIRE WHEN WE WANT

03:12:03.879 --> 03:12:05.947
IT. OR WHEN MOTHER NATURE WANTS
