THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE. FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS RESOLUTION I LOOK FORWARD TO COORDINATING WITH STAFF TO UPDATE THIS RESOLUTION DURING THE NEXT PHASE OF THE PROCESS. EIJI ARE TEN MAKES CLEAR CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP IN THE FIGHT FOR CLEAN AIR BY STATING THE LEGISLATURE'S STRONG AND UNEQUIVOCAL SUPPORT OF THE STATE'S AUTHORITY TO ENACT STRICTER AIR POLLUTION STANDARDS. STANDARDS PURSUANT TO ITS WAIVER UNDER THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT IN ADDITION AS IT WILL BE AMENDED THIS RESOLUTION ARTICULATES THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT. FOR A RECENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE STATE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS WHICH WILL AND CONTINUE TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA LEADS ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC ADMINISTRATION AND THE U. S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. AGENCY IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN PROPOSED UNDER THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION THE SAY FOR AFFORDABLE FUEL EFFICIENT OR THE SO CALLED SAFE VEHICLE ROOM THIS PROPOSAL AIM TO TAKE ACTION THAT WOULD WEAKEN THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIA TO ENACT ENACT POLICIES THAT ADDRESS PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOMES AND TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL AIMS TO END CURRENT FUEL ECONOMY TARGETS IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TAKE AWAY CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO SET OUR OWN MORE STRINGENT VEHICLE STANDARDS. THIS ROOM MADE CLEAR THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WAS COMMITTED TO EMBARKING ON A POORLY CRAFTED TO STRATEGY TO ROLL BACK THE PROGRESS CALIFORNIA HAS MADE ON CLEANER. DESPITE THE SUPPOSEDLY BENEFIT TO THE PROPOSAL THE CONSEQUENCES OF ADOPTING THE ADMINISTRATION STANDARD WILL BE DETRIMENTAL IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD NOT ONLY INCREASE OIL CONSUMPTION BY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND BARRELS PER DAY BUT IT IS ESTIMATED TO COST CALIFORNIA THIRTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS. DUE TO NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. THE SITUATION LED THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO NEGOTIATE DIRECTLY WITH THE VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 30% OF NEW CARS AND SUVS SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES. ON JULY TWENTY FOURTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AN AGREEMENT WAS ANNOUNCED. REGARDING EMISSION STANDARDS INCENTIVES TO ADOPT A TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS AND DECREASES IN MANUFACTURES AND CRUDE COST PENALTIES BY EXTENDING PRODUCTION DEADLINES. THIS AGREEMENT APPLAUDED BY MANY IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY WORKING TOGETHER TO ADDRESS AIR POLLUTION EVEN IN THE FACE OF A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LOOKING TO OBSTRUCT PROGRESS. CALIFORNIA MUST CLEARLY STATE THAT WE STRONGLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY SUPPORT CLEAN AIR AND REJECT ANY MEASURE THAT ROLLS BACK PROGRESS OF AIR QUALITY STANDARDS WE MUST CONTINUE OUR ROLE AS A NATIONAL LEADER. IN EGGS IN ACTING MEASURES TO PROGRESS TO PROGRESS LONGSTANDING PROTECTIONS OF CALIFORNIANS PUBLIC HEALTH THE ENVIRONMENT AND ECONOMIC VITALITY. HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION ARE ROCKY RUSHING WITH THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR AND MELISSA FROM METAL WITH A CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS. ROCKY RUSHING WITH KHALIF CLEAN AIR MR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE FOUNDATIONAL CHALLENGE FACED BY CALIFORNIA IN THE REST OF THE NATION. LAST WEEK THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD ANNOUNCED A ONE PERCENT DECREASE IN THE STATE'S GHG EMISSIONS. FIND MUCH WILL HOWEVER IF THAT'S THE RIGHT RIGHT PHRASE IT REMAINS THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WHERE MISSIONS WERE UP NEARLY 1% DUE IN LARGE PART TO PASSENGER VEHICLES. IN ADDITION TO OUR PLANET HEATING UP IN THE RESULTING WILDFIRES EXTREME WEATHER PATTERNS AND ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS FOR OUR BREATHING POLLUTED AIR THAT'S MAKING THEM SICK. THIS IS A BACKDROP THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS PUSHING TO FREEZE EXISTING FUEL ECONOMY IN GHG EMISSIONS STANDARDS THAT WOULD ILLUSTRATE GROWING BLOW TO OUR NATION'S ECONOMIC CLIMATE GOALS. DAVID MS IN MINISTRATIONS ALSO ATTEMPTED TO STRIP CALIFORNIA OF ITS THIRTY TO SET ITS OWN EMISSIONS STANDARDS UNDER THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT. WHICH THIRTEEN STATES PLUS WASHINGTON DC HAVE ALSO ADOPTED. LITIGATION WOULD CERTAINLY FOLLOW MAKING ECONOMIC ANIMATIONS OUTCOMES AND CLEAR S WELL AS SPLIT IN THE NATION'S. VEHICLE MARKET BECAUSE IN A REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL HEADACHE FOR AUTO MAKERS. CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS ABOUT 12% OF THE NATION'S AUTO MARKET BY THE WAY. FORBES RECENTLY REPORTED THAT IF SUCCESSFUL TRUMP'S CLEAN CAR ROLL BACK WILL COST US CONSUMERS UP TO FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS THROUGH TWENTY FIFTY AND INCREASE TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS 10% IN TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. FOR THESE REASONS AND MORE CAL KALIEF CLEANER SUPPORTS AJ ARE CAN AND THANKS ASSEMBLYMEMBER RADIUS FOR ITS INTRODUCTION A JAR CAN SEND A CLEAR AND UNMISTAKABLE STATEMENT THAT CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE WILL NOT WAVER OR RETREAT FROM OUR THIRTY TO SET EMISSION STANDARDS. THAT GO BEYOND THOSE SET BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. YOU AMENDMENTS TO THE RESOLUTION IS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED WILL ALIGN IT WITH RECENT PACT BETWEEN CARBON FOR OTHER AUTOMAKERS. DOUBLE CIRCUMVENT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ESTABLISH VOLUNTARY EMISSION STANDARDS AND THE NEW YORK TIMES WAS REPORTING YESTERDAY THAT MERCEDES BENZ WILL BE JOINING THE PACK AS WELL SO THAT'S A STRONG STATEMENT. THREE DECADES CALIFORNIA'S BEEN A NATIONAL LEADER IN ESTABLISHING BENCHMARK FOR AUTOMATION'S WE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S AT STAKE CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN CAR STANDARDS HAVE RESULTED IN PASSENGER VEHICLES THAT POLLUTED LESS WHILE SAVING CONSUMERS MONEY AT THE PUMP AND REDUCING HEALTHCARE COSTS. AND THOUGH CALIFORNIA'S TRANSPORTATION SECTOR CONTINUES TO PRODUCE ABOUT 37% OF THE STATE'S GHG EMISSIONS CARR REPORTS THAT THOSE LEVELS ARE TAPERING OFF. SO NOW IS EXACTLY THE RIGHT TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE A STRONG STATEMENT STRONG ENOUGH TO BE HEARD IN THE WHITE HOUSE. COLLEGE CLEANER ASK THAT YOU VOTE I ON AJ ARE TEN THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU ROCKY THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS. AS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES ITS IRRESPONSIBLE ATTACKS ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE HEALTH OF OUR PLANET CALIFORNIA HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO LEAD THE NATION TO A MORE JUST AND HEALTHY FUTURE. THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR CONTINUES TO BE THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND WE MUST CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD AND MAKE PROGRESS ON FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS. AFTER THE NEWS THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PLAN TO SEVERELY ROLL BACK EXISTING ROLES WHICH WOULD LIMIT THE FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS. CALIFORNIA STEPPED UP AND RESPONDED. THIS AGREEMENT MADE BETWEEN AIR BEING AUTOMAKERS UP HOLD PUBLIC HEALTH. AND ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS WHILE ALSO. GROWING OUR ECONOMY AND SAVING CONSUMERS MONEY AT THE PUMP. AJ ARE TEN MAKES IT CLEAR THE CALIFORNIA SUPPORTS HIS ACTIONS AND SUPPORTS ENHANCEMENTS TO PUBLIC HEALTH. PROTECTIONS AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS RESOLUTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YOUR.

HI ALEX LEWIS CHARGE WHEN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU OKAY I ANYONE ONE SERIOUS CONCERNS ARE OPPOSITION THE BILL. OKAY THE ITEMS NOW BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS SENATE OLLIE. THANK YOU SO YESTERDAY I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO. THE WITH THE GOVERNOR IN LAKE TAHOE AND SENATOR FEINSTEIN IN THE GOVERNOR FROM NEVADA AS TO THE GOVERNOR ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT. THAT THERE HAS BEEN IS THE BASICALLY THE CAR MANUFACTURERS HAVE AGREED TO JUST DO IT WITHOUT. THEY'RE THEY'RE DOING IT ON THEIR OWN RIGHT THERE THERE WOULD BE WITHOUT THE REGULATION OF THE IF OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CRACKED. SO THEY ARE ENTERING INTO THE AGREEMENTS WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOUR RIGHT TO DO IT. DIRECTLY AND USING THE STATE ON THEIR OWN SO IT'S A BUSINESS DECISION TO. GET A HIGHER MILEAGE. THEY HAVE THEIR FLEETS. RAISE THE MILEAGE STANDARD IS IN THERE SO THEIR DINNER ON THERE SO WHAT'S SO WHAT'S SO WHY WOULD THERE BE A NEED FOR AND AJ ARE IF THEY'RE ALREADY DOING IT ON THEIR OWN. SOME OF THE IT'S NOT ALL MANUFACTURERS THAT ARE DOING THIS BUT THERE HAVE BEEN AGREEMENTS AND WE APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS IN THIS REGARD HAS BEEN A LEADER IN THIS. BUT I THINK THAT THE STATEMENT HOUSE TO BE CLEAR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT LOWER STANDARDS. YES IT IS A BUSINESS DECISION WE SINCERELY APPRECIATE THAT. BUT CALIFORNIA STANDARDS WILL FOREVER BE HIRED THEM WHAT OTHER. WITH WITH THE. THE FEDERAL GVERNMENT IS REQUIRING WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN A LEADER IN THIS SPACE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A LEADER. THOUGH I APPRECIATE ON FIRST I'M- DON'T HAVE A DOG IN THE FIGHT AYE AYE I AM SUPER EXCITED ABOUT GETTING VEHICLES TO GO FURTHER ON A GALLON. FUEL CELL I THINK EVERYBODY IS I THINK THAT'S A LOT TO GO BUT I WILL SHOW YOU YOUR DISTRICT. YEAH I HAVE TO DRIVE A LOT. SO. I HAVE TWO VEHICLES RIGHT NOW THAT OUR PRIMARY VEHICLES THAT HAVE ALMOST TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MILES OF PEACE ON BECAUSE WE DO HAVE TO DRIVE A LOT AND SO I'M SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THE GOALS. BUT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU. SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION THAT I HAVE. WITH CALIFORNIA'S LEADING IN. CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW IT AFFECTS. SOMEBODY WAS IN BUSINESS SO WE HAVE A TRUCKING BUSINESS MY WIFE AND I AND WHEN KEY CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD DECIDED TO MANDATE THAT YOUR VEHICLE HAD TO BE RETROFITTED NO MATTER. WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT IT WAS. TO THE TO THE LAWS THAT CALIFORNIA HAD SET. AT THE TIME IT WAS MANUFACTURED SO LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A OF THE HEAVY VEHICLE THAT'S DEBTS A TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND THIS IS PICK A DATE TWO THOUSAND IT WAS MANUFACTURED IN TWO THOUSAND TO MEET THE STANDARDS OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEN THE THEN THE EPA THE FEDERAL EPA. CALIFORNIA CAME IN AND SAID WELL THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR US WE NEED TO. MAKE YOU RETROFIT YOUR VEHICLE AND SO IT WAS ABOUT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR RETROFITTED ONLY CALIFORNIA DID. SO IN OUR CASE WE AYE WE EACH HAVE TO RETROFIT OR BY AND THEY GAVE US YOU GAVE ME THEY GAVE ME SOME TIME. YOU HAD HEALTH. IN CERTAIN CASES TWENTY REDUCE OF THE IN MY POINT IS THAT. WE KNEW THAT TO THE PASSENGER CAR WE ONLY DID IT TO THE PERSON WHO IS IN BUSINESS IS TRACKING AND SO. THE PASSENGER CAR IS ABLE TO AS IT WEARS OUT THE MANUFACTURES WERE MANDATED TO BRING US TO A TEAR FOR MOTOR WHICH IS WHAT THEY WE HAVE NOW AND SO YOU GOT THE LIFE OF YOUR PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. YOU GOT TO USE IT AND YOU DIDN'T GET PUNISHED CHANGING THE RULES IN THE MIDDLE THE GAME AND SO MY POINT IS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE CHANGES CLIMATE AND WE WANT TO MAKE AIR CLEAN I THINK WHAT WE'RE ALL FOR THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY THAT DOESN'T WANT. A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO. BUT JUST THE FACT THAT. YOU CHANGE WHEN YOU CHANGE IT'S A PENSIVE AND IT'S- AND IT'S ONLY DAMAGING TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT AS YOU KNOW YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY THIS. MANY TIMES AND MAY THE MEMBERS IS THAT. YOU KNOW I THINK OUR FOCUS ON THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. IS MAYBE OR TO FOCUS TO AND LASER DOWN ON TRANSPORTATION VERSES ALL THE OTHER CLIMATE POLLUTANTS THAT WE'RE- LIMITING OUT THERE AND IN A I TALK ABOUT WILD FIRE AND HOW MUCH. LOSE WE PUT OUT IN WILD FIRE AND END OF A COST. THAT WERE PUSHING DOWN ON THE ON THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WOULD BE HIGHLY OFFSET ABOUT FOUR DOLLARS A TON TO DO FORCE MANAGEMENT VERSES IN SOME CASES IF YOU LOOK AT THE HIGH SPEED TRAIN HUNDREDS TO A MILLION DOLLARS A TON THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME SO FOR ME. I'M ALL ABOUT. AIR BUT I WANT TO BRING I WANNA ALLOW BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO STAY HERE AND THRIVE AND BE THE LEADER SO I DID HEAR THE GOVERNOR SAY YESTERDAY AND THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE DOING AND OUR ECONOMY IS RUNNING WILL. PARTS OF OUR ECONOMY IS IN THE OTHER PARTS ARE SUFFERING AND I I'M ON THE SUFFERING INTO THAT. BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO A BUSINESS PLAN AND YOU. SAY I'M GONNA GO TO THE BANK AND BORROW MONEY TO BUY THIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT TO. RUN MY BUSINESS YOU HAVE TO PAY THAT MONEY BACK AND THEN WHEN THE GOVERNMENT COMES IN AND CHANGES THE RULES IN THE MIDDLE GAME THAT WASN'T PART OF YOUR BUSINESS PLAN. THE GUY. AND THE GUY IN OREGON. AND THE GUY IN CHINA ARE. DOING THOSE SAME THINGS THAT I HAVE TO DO AND I'M COMPETING IT'S AND SO I JUST WANT TO. MOVE IS NOT THIS IS NOT DIRECTED TOWARDS. THE AUTHOR THIS BILL I'M LOOKING AT YOU BECAUSE IT YOUR BILL BUT I WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT HERE BUT THAT WE NEED TO BE CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT. THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE IN CALIFORNIA. HER CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND ALSO. PUSHED UP POLLUTION TO OTHER PLACES THAT. DON'T DON'T HAVE THE SAME AS WE WANT TO LEAD BUT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO LEAD. WITH WITH SOME. ABILITY KEEP PEOPLE. DOING WHAT THEY DO IN CALIFORNIA. SURE AND THE SECONDLY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REDUCE CARBON. WHERE IT IS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE AND I BELIEVE WE CAN DO THAT THROUGH FORESTRY AND THROUGH FIRE MITIGATION A LOT. LESS EXPENSIVE THAN WE DO IN TRANSPORTATION SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THOSE IS NOT THIS IS NOT DIRECTOR TO BUILD BUT IT'S THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF WE ALL TALK ABOUT GOING ELECTRIC AND YET WE'RE ALL FOR THAT BUT WE NEED TO DO IT IN A IN A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO KEEP THIS ALSO. IN CALIFORNIA BUSINESS AND YOU KNOW ON TOP OF. A LOT OF OTHER PIECES OF LEGISLATION IS NOT JUST THE ONE. PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT CAUSE YOU TO. HAVE PROBLEMS WE HAVE AB FIVE NOW THIS IS IN MEAN WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT. TO BE IN BUSINESS AND I HAPPEN TO KNOW PER FIRST HERE BECAUSE IT IS. IT'S ACTUALLY OUR BUSINESS THAT WE DO SO. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE FALL FOR IT I'M ALL FOR HIGH I WANT MY- DIESEL TRUCK TO GET. THIRTY MILES AGAIN ON SUNDAY THAT WOULD BE AWESOME. I'M ALL FOR THAT. BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU. THAT THE MEMBERS UNDER. AND THAT THE ACTIONS WE TAKE YOUR ARE PAINFUL AND THERE. AND IT HURTS. YOUR BUSINESS WHEN YOU HAVE A BUSINESS PLAN AND THE GOVERNMENT CHANGE THE RULES. AND NOT EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD'S CHANGING THOSE RULES AS WELL SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FIRST OKAY YEAH.
