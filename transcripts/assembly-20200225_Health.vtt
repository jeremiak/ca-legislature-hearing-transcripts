AND MINIMIZE THE- OF HEALTH

00:28:53.431 --> 00:28:54.933
COSTS CITIES FOR. A BIG PROBLEM

00:28:54.999 --> 00:28:56.101
WHICH I'M GOING TO TALK MORE

00:28:56.167 --> 00:28:57.469
ABOUT- BUT IT'S IMPORTANT

00:28:57.535 --> 00:28:58.803
UNDERSTAND THAT THE GROWTH IN

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:00.638
HEALTHCARE COSTS- HAS IN FACT

00:29:00.705 --> 00:29:03.208
SLOWED. DRAMATICALLY OVER TIME-

00:29:03.274 --> 00:29:04.442
IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND

00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:06.077
EIGHT IS DOUBLE DIGIT INCREASES

00:29:06.144 --> 00:29:07.612
IN HEALTHCARE SPENDING WERE

QUITE ROUTINE AND- MUST

00:29:09.214 --> 00:29:16.821
INCREASES. FAR OUT IS THE

00:29:16.888 --> 00:29:21.159

KERN DECADE SPENDING IS AB.

00:29:22.927 --> 00:29:23.928
LESS FOUR PER. JOE BARELY

00:29:23.995 --> 00:29:32.170
GREATER THAN THAN. P. THE-

00:29:32.237 --> 00:29:34.205
ISN'T FRANK NO CONSENSUS ON

00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:35.140
HEALTH CARE SPEND GROWTH HAS

00:29:35.206 --> 00:29:37.208
SLOWED MUCH SOME PASTA. AND A

00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:39.744
LOW AND LOW GROWTH IN PRICES IN

00:29:39.811 --> 00:29:51.723
ECONOMY GENERALLY. A SORE. NO I

00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:53.791
DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH A

00:29:53.858 --> 00:29:54.459
SENSE THAT THE PICTURES ALL

00:29:54.526 --> 00:29:55.994
ROSY- WELL HEALTH SPENDING

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.729
GROWTH REACHED A LOW POINT-

00:29:57.795 --> 00:30:00.331
EARLIER IN THE DECADE IN TWO

00:30:00.398 --> 00:30:00.832
THOUSAND THIRTEEN IN TWO

00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:02.000
THOUSAND FOURTEEN- IT'S BEEN

00:30:02.066 --> 00:30:03.501
RISING SUBSTANTIALLY FAST.

00:30:03.568 --> 00:30:04.936
SINCE THEN AND INSTEAD OF

00:30:05.003 --> 00:30:07.172
GROWING OVER 5% PER YEAR

00:30:07.238 --> 00:30:09.874
SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW IN THE

00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:10.942
NINETEEN NINETIES AND TWO

00:30:11.009 --> 00:30:11.476
THOUSANDS. HEALTHCARE IS

00:30:11.543 --> 00:30:12.410
GROWING FASTER THAT PLACE MUCH

00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:14.579
FASTER THAN WORK. JUST A SO WE

00:30:14.646 --> 00:30:15.813
STILLHAVE A IG HEALTH CARE

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.916
COST AND AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM

00:30:17.982 --> 00:30:21.019
IS LIKELY TO GET WORSE RATHER

00:30:21.085 --> 00:30:23.188
AND THAT. SOME EVIDENCE THE

00:30:23.254 --> 00:30:24.355
HEALTH CARE COST. PROBLEM IS

00:30:24.422 --> 00:30:26.224
EVEN WORSE I CALIFORNIA THEN

00:30:26.291 --> 00:30:28.059
THEN IT IS IN THE REST OF THE

00:30:28.126 --> 00:30:29.994
COUNTRY- IT'S USEFUL TO FOCUS

00:30:30.061 --> 00:30:31.796
HERE ON EMPLOYER BASED

00:30:31.863 --> 00:30:33.198
INSURANCE THAT'S WHERE MOST

00:30:33.264 --> 00:30:34.866
PEOPLE- GET. FOR MORE PEOPLE

00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:36.701
THAN ANY. OTHER SOURCE GET GET

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:38.937
COVERAGE- AND WHILE THE

00:30:39.003 --> 00:30:40.205
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT A LOT TO

00:30:40.271 --> 00:30:41.306

00:30:41.372 --> 00:30:43.408
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

00:30:43.474 --> 00:30:45.410
EMPLOYER COVERAGE. I DID LITTLE

00:30:45.476 --> 00:30:47.011

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:56.221
THE- BRIDGE IS THOUSAND SIX

HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN DOLLARS

00:30:56.854 --> 00:30:57.922
MOST OF WHICH IS PAID BY

00:30:57.989 --> 00:31:00.191
EMPLOYERS- BUSINESSES AND

00:31:00.258 --> 00:31:02.327
CALIFORNIA THE PREMIUM THE

00:31:02.393 --> 00:31:03.995
AVERAGE PREMIUM IS ABOUT 6%

00:31:04.062 --> 00:31:06.297
HIGHER THAN THAT AT ALL TWENTY

00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:08.466
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND OF COURSE

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:09.267
THE PREMIUM DOESN'T TELL THE

00:31:09.334 --> 00:31:10.535
WHOLE STORY SINCE PEOPLE HAVE

00:31:10.602 --> 00:31:11.869
SUBSTANTIAL AND GROWING OUT OF

00:31:11.936 --> 00:31:14.672

DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THAT UP 67%

00:31:35.093 --> 00:31:36.661
OVER THE LAST LAST DECADE. BUT

00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:38.429
STILL AS MUCH AS FAMILIES ARE

00:31:38.496 --> 00:31:39.998
PAYING THE LION'S SHARE OF

00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:41.299
THESE INSURANCE COSTS ARE STILL

00:31:41.366 --> 00:31:43.001

COST BURDEN FOR BUSINESSES AND

00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:49.641
A DRAG ON WAGES AS MORE OF

00:31:49.707 --> 00:31:50.208
COMPENSATION GOES TO HELP.

00:31:50.275 --> 00:31:57.782
RATHER. THE. DEDUCTIBLES IN

00:31:57.849 --> 00:31:58.850
PARTICULAR HAVE RAISED

00:31:58.916 --> 00:32:00.652
AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES FOR

00:32:00.718 --> 00:32:02.120
PATIENTS AND DEDUCTIBLES AN

00:32:02.186 --> 00:32:04.422
EMPLOYER BASED PLANS ARE UP A

00:32:04.489 --> 00:32:06.357
HUNDRED AND 62% IN THE LAST TEN

00:32:06.424 --> 00:32:07.792
YEARS MEETING AT WHICH THE

00:32:07.859 --> 00:32:09.861
DOCTOR BILLS ARE NOT MORE THAN

00:32:09.927 --> 00:32:12.330
TWO AND A HALF TIMES WHAT THEY

00:32:12.397 --> 00:32:13.364
WERE A DECADE AGO OVER THAT

00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:15.833
SAME WORKERS THINGS ARE UP JUST

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:16.467
TWENTY SIX PERCENT. SO

00:32:16.534 --> 00:32:17.969
DEDUCTION INCREASD SIX TIMES

00:32:18.036 --> 00:32:19.304
FASTER THAN WILL WORK MAVERICK

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:20.805
YOU'RE MAKING A LEADING TO AN

00:32:20.872 --> 00:32:23.241
AFFORDABILITY CAPPED AT CAP FOR

00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:25.810
WORKERS IN IN A PIECE OF GOOD

00:32:25.877 --> 00:32:27.779
NEWS OR MAYBE LESS BAD NEWS-

00:32:27.845 --> 00:32:29.647
FOR CALIFORNIA DEDUCTIBLES ARE

00:32:29.714 --> 00:32:32.016
ONE AREA- WE'RE CALIFORNIANS

00:32:32.083 --> 00:32:33.818
ARE SOMEWHAT BETTER OFF- FORTY.

00:32:33.885 --> 00:32:35.486
6% OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE A

00:32:35.553 --> 00:32:37.522
DEDUCTIBLE MUCH LOWER THAN THE

00:32:37.588 --> 00:32:39.824
85% NATIONALLY YOU TO DO AN

00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:41.292
EMPLOYER BASED PLANTS- AND THE

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:42.527
AVERAGE DEDUCTIBLE IN

00:32:42.593 --> 00:32:44.295
CALIFORNIA'S FOURTEEN HUNDRED

00:32:44.362 --> 00:32:46.097
AND TWO DOLLARS. HIGHLY LOWER

00:32:46.164 --> 00:32:47.165
THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. PART

00:32:47.231 --> 00:32:48.132
OF THE REASON FOR THIS IS A

00:32:48.199 --> 00:32:49.834
MUCH HIGHER PENETRATION OF HMO

00:32:49.901 --> 00:32:52.403
IS IN THE STATE- FORTY FIVE

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:55.206
PERCENT- IN CALIFORNIA VERSES

00:32:55.273 --> 00:32:56.908
15% NASH NATIONALLY- IN IT

00:32:56.974 --> 00:32:58.643
THOSE ARE. LESS LIKELY OF

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:00.845
DOCTOR BILLS- THEN- OTHER TYPES

00:33:00.912 --> 00:33:04.949
OF PLANS LIKE PPO IS. I'M IN

00:33:05.016 --> 00:33:05.683
CALIFORNIA DEDUCTIBLES HAVE

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:06.784
GOTTEN OT. FOR HUNDRED DOLLAR

00:33:06.851 --> 00:33:07.885
DEDUCTIBLE CAN FEEL LIKE NO

00:33:07.952 --> 00:33:10.621
INSURANCE AT ALL- WHEN YOU HAVE

00:33:10.688 --> 00:33:11.923
NEXT TO NOTHING IN THE BANK-

00:33:11.989 --> 00:33:13.725
SAVE FOR A RAINY DAY AS IS THE

00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:15.426
CASE FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS.

00:33:15.493 --> 00:33:16.627
ACCORDING TO FEDERAL RESERVE

00:33:16.694 --> 00:33:18.529
ABOUT 40% OF AMERICANS WOULDN'T

00:33:18.596 --> 00:33:20.064
BE ABLE TO COVER A FOUR HUNDRED

00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:21.866
DOLLAR EMERGENCY- WITH CASH

00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:24.569
SAVINGS. OR CREDIT CARD CHARGE

00:33:24.635 --> 00:33:26.037
THAT THEY CAN QUICKLY PAY OFF-

00:33:26.104 --> 00:33:28.339
SO- AND THAT'S MUCH LESS THAN

00:33:28.406 --> 00:33:29.874
THE AVERAGE DEDUCTIBLE SO AGAIN

00:33:29.941 --> 00:33:31.142
THIS FOR MANY PEOPLE MAY FEEL

00:33:31.209 --> 00:33:33.044
LIKE- LIKE ALMOST NO INSURANCE

00:33:33.111 --> 00:33:37.014
AT ALL. NOW TO AS BAD AS AN AN

00:33:37.081 --> 00:33:38.983
OUTDATED AS THE DATA STATEWIDE

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:40.752
ON HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE- IT'S

00:33:40.818 --> 00:33:42.687
FRANKLY EVEN WORSE REGIONALLY-

00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:44.122
WE DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT HOW

00:33:44.188 --> 00:33:46.124
HEALTHCARE COSTS VARY ACROSS

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:49.193
THAT. VERY LARGE STATE- BUT

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:50.928
THERE ARE SOME INDICATIONS THAT

00:33:50.995 --> 00:33:52.530
HEALTH CARE BECAUSE DO VERY

00:33:52.597 --> 00:33:54.465
TREMENDOUS. IF FOR EXAMPLE AT.

00:33:54.532 --> 00:33:57.735
YOUR PREMIUMS OVER CAL IN LA-

00:33:57.802 --> 00:33:59.637
THE LOWEST COST BROWN'S PLAN

00:33:59.704 --> 00:34:00.571
FOR FORTY YEAR OLD THIS YEAR IS

00:34:00.638 --> 00:34:02.140
LESS THAN THIRTY THREE HUNDRED

00:34:02.206 --> 00:34:03.441
DOLLARS- THAT'S IT'S

00:34:03.508 --> 00:34:04.776
SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IN

00:34:04.842 --> 00:34:06.677
SACRAMENTO AND SAN FRANCISCO-

00:34:06.744 --> 00:34:08.413
EVEN HIGHER IN THE FAR NORTH OF

00:34:08.479 --> 00:34:11.048
THE STATE- INSURANCE AND EUREKA

00:34:11.115 --> 00:34:11.949
FOR EXAMPLE. 52% MORE

00:34:12.016 --> 00:34:15.987
EXPENSIVE- THAT EL NOW THIS IS

00:34:16.053 --> 00:34:17.355
VERY LIKELY TIGHT UNDERLYING

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:18.923
COST OF HEALTHCARE IN THESE

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:20.792
DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES- IT'S

00:34:20.858 --> 00:34:22.059
PROBABLY NOT THE CASE THAT

00:34:22.126 --> 00:34:23.594
PEOPLE IN SAN FRANCISCO OR

00:34:23.661 --> 00:34:25.763
SACRAMENTO OR EUREKA. THAT MUCH

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:26.697
SICKER THAN PEOPLE IN LOS

00:34:26.764 --> 00:34:28.866
ANGELES- MORE LIKELY IS THAT

00:34:28.933 --> 00:34:30.034
HEALTHCARE PRICES ARE SIMPLY

00:34:30.101 --> 00:34:30.501
MUCH HIGHER IN THOSE

00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:33.471
COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S DUE IN

00:34:33.538 --> 00:34:35.006
PART TO. SOLID ATION AMONG

00:34:35.072 --> 00:34:37.108
HOSPITALS PROVIDERS. I IN THE

00:34:37.175 --> 00:34:38.843
AREA SACRAMENTO. IS PROVIDED

00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:39.877
HAVE MUCH GREATER LEVERAGE TO

00:34:39.944 --> 00:34:41.813
DEMAND HIGHER PRICES- IN IN

00:34:41.879 --> 00:34:43.915
RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE- WHERE

00:34:43.981 --> 00:34:45.650
THERE ARE MANY FEWER PROVIDERS

00:34:45.716 --> 00:34:47.919
LEVERAGE CAN BE EVEN MORE

00:34:47.985 --> 00:34:50.655
PRONOUNCED. I'M REALLY IN OUR

00:34:50.721 --> 00:34:51.956
HOT GROWING PRICE ARE THE

00:34:52.023 --> 00:34:53.658
FACTORY. INCREASING HEALTH CARE

00:34:53.724 --> 00:34:55.827
COSTS- THE FACT THAT WE SPEND

00:34:55.893 --> 00:34:57.395
DOUBLE PER PERSON WHAT OTHER

00:34:57.462 --> 00:34:59.130
COUNTRIES SPEND IS NOT BECAUSE

00:34:59.197 --> 00:35:00.832
WE ARE SICKER WE USE MORE CARE.

00:35:00.898 --> 00:35:02.266
THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE. HIGHER

00:35:02.333 --> 00:35:03.734
PRICES FOR THE CARE AND

00:35:03.801 --> 00:35:05.837
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WE USE- WE

00:35:05.903 --> 00:35:06.804
HAVE A PRICE PROBLEM IN THE

00:35:06.871 --> 00:35:08.840
UNITED STATES BUT IT'S REALLY A

00:35:08.906 --> 00:35:10.508
PRIVATE PRICE PROBLEM- HI.

00:35:10.575 --> 00:35:11.242
THERE IT'S TRADED IN PRIVATE

00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:12.944
INSURANCE WERE PRICE GROWTH HAS

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:16.447
BEEN FAR OUTPACING- MEDICARE.

00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:17.048
AND MEDICAID OR MEDICARE

00:35:17.114 --> 00:35:18.983
HEALTH- WE'RE PRICE INCREASES

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:20.551
HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE MODEST

00:35:20.618 --> 00:35:22.653
ESTIMATES VERY GENERALLY

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.021
SPEAKING PRIVATE INSURERS PAY

00:35:24.088 --> 00:35:28.993
ABOUT DOUBLE FOR HOT WHAT. TO

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:29.861
MAKE THIS A LITTLE MORE

00:35:29.927 --> 00:35:31.529
TANGIBLE THE PRICES PAID BY

00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:32.930
PRIVATE INSURERS FOR KNEE

00:35:32.997 --> 00:35:34.565
REPLACEMENT HAS INCREASED FOR

00:35:34.632 --> 00:35:36.767
EXAMPLE FROM UNDER TWENTY

00:35:36.834 --> 00:35:40.438
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TWO

00:35:40.505 --> 00:35:42.006
THOUSAND THREE AT OVER THIRTY

00:35:42.073 --> 00:35:42.573
FOUR THOUSAND TWENTY. AGAIN

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.243
THAT INFORMATION. WELL NOT AS

00:35:45.309 --> 00:35:47.578
BIG A DRIVER OF HEALTH CARE

00:35:47.645 --> 00:35:49.680
COST GROWTH IS PRICES- THE

00:35:49.747 --> 00:35:50.982
ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD IN OUR

00:35:51.048 --> 00:35:52.216
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS ALSO GROWN

00:35:52.283 --> 00:35:54.652
SIGNIFICANTLY OVER TIME AT THE

00:35:54.719 --> 00:35:55.686
SHARE OF HEALTH SPENDING

00:35:55.753 --> 00:35:57.755
DEVOTED TO INSURANCE OVERHEAD

00:35:57.822 --> 00:35:59.957
TWO AND A HALF AN OF OVERALL

00:36:00.024 --> 00:36:03.895
HEALTH SPENDING A DECADES AGO

00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:04.996
TO OVER 7% THIS IS DAVID

00:36:05.062 --> 00:36:06.631
MINISTER. WITH MEN DIFFERENT

00:36:06.697 --> 00:36:09.066
ENSURE- ANDTHAT AND THAT COST

00:36:09.133 --> 00:36:10.735
IS NOT JUST THE OVERHEAD AND

00:36:10.801 --> 00:36:12.103
PROFIT FROM INSURERS THAT WE

00:36:12.169 --> 00:36:14.071
SEE HERE BUT IT ALSO LEADS TO

00:36:14.138 --> 00:36:15.640
HIGHER COSTS IN IN- BILLING

00:36:15.706 --> 00:36:17.475
DEPARTMENTS AND HOSPITALS AND

00:36:17.542 --> 00:36:19.377
PHYSICIAN OFFICES WHICH ARE IN

00:36:19.443 --> 00:36:22.313
ADDITION- NUMBERS. OKAY NOW

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:23.748
ALTERNATELY WHY CARE ABOUT

00:36:23.814 --> 00:36:24.582
HEALTHCARE COSTS IS BECAUSE

00:36:24.649 --> 00:36:26.717
WHAT IT MEANS FOR AFFORDABILITY

00:36:26.784 --> 00:36:28.152
FOR GOVERNMENT FOR BUSINESSES

00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:31.055
AND OF COURSE FOR PATIENTS. A

00:36:31.122 --> 00:36:31.556
RECENT SURVEY FROM THE

00:36:31.622 --> 00:36:32.857
CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE

00:36:32.924 --> 00:36:36.060
FOUNDATION FOUND THAT 51% OF

00:36:36.127 --> 00:36:37.995
CALIFORNIANS POST. SCRIPT HERE

00:36:38.062 --> 00:36:40.565
IN THE LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF

00:36:40.631 --> 00:36:41.132
CAUGHT. IN THE SAY THAT HAVE

00:36:41.198 --> 00:36:44.435
THEIR HEALTHCARE GOT WORSE AS A

00:36:44.502 --> 00:36:45.803
RESULT OF. IN THE NATIONAL WE

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.905
DID WITH EMPLOYER BASED

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:49.373
INSURANCE WE FOUND WIDESPREAD

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.742
AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES. A 40%

00:36:51.809 --> 00:36:53.277
HAD SOME TYPE OF PROBLEM

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:54.545
AFFORDING HEALTH CARE IN THE

00:36:54.612 --> 00:36:56.781
LAST YEAR INCLUDING PROBLEMS

00:36:56.847 --> 00:36:59.283
PAYING MEDICAL BILL PAYING FOR

DEDUCTIBLES. HANDLING COPAYS

00:37:01.586 --> 00:37:04.422
FOR DRUG. OR PAYING THEIR THEIR

00:37:04.488 --> 00:37:05.523
MONTH. AND THIS IS OF COURSE.

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:08.092
PROBLEM HEALTH DUE TO THE BUT

00:37:08.159 --> 00:37:08.960
IT'S ALSO POINT TO REMEMBER

00:37:09.026 --> 00:37:11.062
THAT THE INABILITY TO AFFORD

00:37:11.128 --> 00:37:12.663
HEALTH CARE ALSO LEADS TO

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:13.564
FINANCIAL AND SECURITY MORE

00:37:13.631 --> 00:37:15.099
GENERALLY MANY PEOPLE SAID THE

00:37:15.166 --> 00:37:16.601
PROBLEM SUPPORTING CARE IN THE

00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:18.269
LAST YEAR REPORTER PAINS OF

00:37:18.336 --> 00:37:20.571
SACRIFICES SUCH AS PUTTING OFF

00:37:20.638 --> 00:37:22.440
MAJOR PURCHASES CUTTING

JALAL. HOSPITAL SO YOU KNOW

OF DRUGS DIRECTLY THEY SHOW UP

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:02.426
IN A HOSPITAL BILL- BUT THEY

00:41:02.493 --> 00:41:03.961
THEY CERTAINLY REPRESENT-

00:41:04.028 --> 00:41:06.363
SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSE. YES THE

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:07.364
NUMBER WE HAD HEARD WAS CLOSED

ABOUT CLOSE TO TWENTY WHICH IS

00:41:08.933 --> 00:41:10.634

00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:13.904
NOT NINE PERCENT. FOR OVERALL

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:15.673
AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:16.707
CARES THAT CERTAINLY I THINK

00:41:16.774 --> 00:41:18.008
THE INDUSTRY WOULD LIKE TO

00:41:18.075 --> 00:41:19.143
THINK IT'S A NINETY CENT. BUT

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:21.078
THE REALITY IS IT'S MUCH MORE

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:22.613
IT'S ALSO GREAT IS JUST PUT IN

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.115
DIFFERENT PLACES SO- WE WERE

00:41:25.182 --> 00:41:26.717
TALKING ABOUT THE COPS YOU KNOW

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:28.352
HOW WE AND SEVEN. DIRECTION

00:41:28.419 --> 00:41:30.087
SPENDING THE RATE INCREASE WAS

00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:31.822
HIGHER HIS BEEN YOU KNOW KIND

00:41:31.889 --> 00:41:33.791
OF DAHLE COST AVERAGE IT FOR

00:41:33.858 --> 00:41:36.227
THE FACT THAT MAYBE THINGS WERE

00:41:36.293 --> 00:41:37.528
REALLY CHEAP IN NINETEEN

00:41:37.595 --> 00:41:40.564
SEVENTY. VERSES NOW WE MRI EYES

00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:42.733
AND- CAP GAINS IN NINETEEN

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.269
SEVENTY SO. DATA EVER BEEN I

00:41:45.336 --> 00:41:49.707
STILL. THE REAL. NUMBER IS

00:41:49.773 --> 00:41:51.742
PERSISTENT. BECAUSE MY IN AS A

00:41:51.809 --> 00:41:54.078
KID I REMEMBER. MY FOLKS EVER

00:41:54.144 --> 00:41:55.079

00:41:56.614 --> 00:41:58.549
TIMES BEING AN EMERGENCY ROOMS

00:41:58.616 --> 00:42:00.618
FOR STUPID THINGS. THAT I DID.

00:42:00.684 --> 00:42:02.553
AND IT BUT I DON'T EVER

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.588
REMEMBER THAT BEING AN ISSUE

00:42:04.655 --> 00:42:08.792
AND- AND- YEAH I KNOW NOT WHAT

00:42:08.859 --> 00:42:10.527
I WAS SAID I WAS FRANKLY KIDS

00:42:10.594 --> 00:42:11.662
TEND TO I WAS NOT STARTING

00:42:11.729 --> 00:42:16.934
HEALTH POLICY. BUT THERE ARE- I

00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:17.835
MEAN THE SEVENTIES WERE. WITH

00:42:17.902 --> 00:42:19.770
VERY HIGH INFLATION RIGHT SO

00:42:19.837 --> 00:42:22.573
JUST JUST GENERALLY SO A DOUBLE

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.407
DIGIT INCREASE IN HEALTHCARE

00:42:23.474 --> 00:42:26.810
COSTS DIDN'T QUITE FEEL LIKE

00:42:26.877 --> 00:42:28.212
THE SAME WAY IT DID DID TODAY.

00:42:28.279 --> 00:42:29.480
YEAH INSURANCE LOOKED VERY

00:42:29.546 --> 00:42:31.282
DIFFERENT THAN- YOU KNOW PEOPLE

00:42:31.348 --> 00:42:34.051
DIDN'T FACE BIG DEDUCTIBLES- SO

00:42:34.118 --> 00:42:35.052
FOR A FROM A FAMILY'S

00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:38.155
PERSPECTIVE- THE OUT OF POCKET

00:42:38.222 --> 00:42:39.256
COSTS SHOULDN'T FEEL LIKE SUCH

00:42:39.323 --> 00:42:41.825
A BURDEN AS AS IT DID TODAY- IN

00:42:41.892 --> 00:42:43.160
IN SINCE THEN HEALTHCARE COSTS

00:42:43.227 --> 00:42:44.762
HAVE RISEN DRAMATICALLY FASTER

00:42:44.828 --> 00:42:47.932
THAN PEOPLE'S WAGES. SO YOU

00:42:47.998 --> 00:42:49.700
KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HEALTH

00:42:49.767 --> 00:42:51.802
CARE COST SLOWING DOWN- IF WE

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:53.070
IS ARE SLOWING DOWN EVEN MORE-

00:42:53.137 --> 00:42:55.039
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY FEEL

00:42:55.105 --> 00:42:57.942
GOOD GUY TO A FAMILY- NOW I

00:42:58.008 --> 00:42:59.510
THINK THE PARTY QUESTIONS IS.

00:42:59.576 --> 00:43:01.145
KIND OF WHAT WHAT WE GET FOR

00:43:01.211 --> 00:43:04.915
THIS EXTRA MONEY- OF EUROPE WE

00:43:04.982 --> 00:43:08.352
DIDN'T HAVE MRI BACK THEN-

00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:09.954
RIGHT NOW WITH ALL THE SPEND AN

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:14.758
MRI TODAY. WHILE NOT CLEAR. BUT

00:43:14.825 --> 00:43:15.492
A LOT OF CASES WHERE WE GET

00:43:15.559 --> 00:43:16.827
BETTER AT CARE TODAY WE YOU

00:43:16.894 --> 00:43:18.629
KNOW. OF DRY THAT PEOPLE'S

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:20.097
LIVES IN SOME CASES SAVE THEIR

00:43:20.164 --> 00:43:24.535
LIVES- SO WE CERTAINLY ARE

00:43:24.601 --> 00:43:25.736
GETTING MORE HEALTH HEALTH CARE

00:43:25.803 --> 00:43:27.338
TODAY- BUT BUT THE BUT THE BIG.

00:43:27.404 --> 00:43:29.340
THERE IS EVEN HEALTHCARE WE GOT

00:43:29.406 --> 00:43:31.442
BACK THAT NOW COST A WHOLE LOT

00:43:31.508 --> 00:43:33.344
MORE. AND I GUESS THE FINAL IS

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:34.712
JUST MORE OF A POINT I THINK

00:43:34.778 --> 00:43:35.813
THAN A QUESTION I MEAN I

00:43:35.879 --> 00:43:37.915
REPRESENT EUREKA AND THAT SITE

00:43:37.982 --> 00:43:39.183
THAT'S PROBABLY NO ACCIDENT

00:43:39.249 --> 00:43:40.684
THAT SOME ICE ON THAT SIDE

00:43:40.751 --> 00:43:42.386
THEY'RE- IT IS PRETTY. ACCURATE

00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:44.722

00:43:44.788 --> 00:43:47.291
HIGHER PREMIUM 50% HIGHER

00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:49.126
PREMIUM THAN SOUTHERN

HOSPITAL CONSOLIDATION. AS

00:43:52.997 --> 00:43:55.532
BEING A PART OF THAT- I THINK

00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:56.934
THAT THERE'S ALSO I THINK

00:43:57.001 --> 00:43:58.268
THERE'S AFFILIATED MEDICAL

00:43:58.335 --> 00:43:59.970
GROUPS THAT DRIVE RATES AS

00:44:00.037 --> 00:44:02.206
WELL. WHICH BECOME A PART OF

00:44:02.272 --> 00:44:03.507
PART OF THAT A PART OF THAT

00:44:03.574 --> 00:44:05.976
FACTOR AS WELL- AND THEN YOU

00:44:06.043 --> 00:44:08.045

CALIFORNIA IS REALLY BIG AND

00:44:31.135 --> 00:44:32.036
PAINFUL FOR A OF PEOPLE WHO

00:44:32.102 --> 00:44:33.037
ALSO HAVE TO TRAVEL LONG

00:44:33.103 --> 00:44:34.972
DISTANCES TO GET. A LOT OF

EDITORIAL- BUT- BUT IT IS THE

00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:44.882
STRUGGLE THAT THAT WE FACE

00:44:44.948 --> 00:44:46.116
SENATE'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:44:46.183 --> 00:44:47.418
DRIVES ME TO. TO LOOK AT HOW DO

00:44:47.484 --> 00:44:49.153

LITTLE BIT MORE AND WANT YOU TO

00:46:08.866 --> 00:46:11.301
THINK ABOUT IT WOULD GIVE YOU A

00:46:11.368 --> 00:46:16.006
COMPARISON OF OUR- PLANS WOULD

00:46:16.073 --> 00:46:18.876
COST THEY HAD INCREASED AT THE

00:46:18.942 --> 00:46:21.111
SAME RATE BETTER HEALTH CARE.

00:46:21.178 --> 00:46:23.747
WOULD TODAY FORTY EIGHT DOLLARS

00:46:23.814 --> 00:46:24.748
IF THEY INCREASE AT THE SAME

00:46:24.815 --> 00:46:26.283
PRICE SAME RATE AS HEALTH CARE.

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:27.818
A DOZEN EGGS FIFTY FIVE

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:29.453
DOLLARS. AND A GALLON OF MILK

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.788
AND NOT A GRASS FED ORGANIC

00:46:31.855 --> 00:46:32.623
GALLON OF MILK JUST A REGULAR

00:46:32.689 --> 00:46:35.526
GALLON OF MILK. ACOSTA AND

00:46:35.592 --> 00:46:37.494
THIRTY FOUR DOLLARS RIGHT. AND

00:46:37.561 --> 00:46:38.996
SO WHAT THIS TELLS US IS THERE

00:46:39.062 --> 00:46:40.364
SOMETHING REALLY HAPPENING WITH

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:42.466
OUR CARE PRICES AND IT'S VERY

00:46:42.533 --> 00:46:45.202
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:47.104
IN OTHER NATIONS. AREAS THAT

00:46:47.171 --> 00:46:49.673
CAN SEE. I CAN SPEND ON OUR

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:50.440
TWICE AS MUCH AND SOMETIME TWO

00:46:50.507 --> 00:46:52.042
AND A HALF TIMES AS MUCH WHAT

00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:54.111
PEOPLE AND COMPARED IT NATION'S

00:46:54.178 --> 00:46:56.280
ALSO IS FOR THE SAME HEALTH

00:46:56.346 --> 00:46:57.481
CARE GOODS AND SERVICES. ACES

00:46:57.548 --> 00:46:59.516
ARE THE PRIMARY REASON WHY THE

00:46:59.583 --> 00:47:01.552
US SPENDS MORE ON HEALTHCARE

00:47:01.618 --> 00:47:03.420
THAN IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY. AND

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:06.990
THE QUESTION IS WHY. ME SO I'M

00:47:07.057 --> 00:47:08.458
GONNA TALK IN THE IN THE REALM

00:47:08.525 --> 00:47:10.194
OF COMPETITION THERE ARE OTHER

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:10.794
THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED BUT

00:47:10.861 --> 00:47:11.662
I'M GONNA TALK PRETTY

00:47:11.728 --> 00:47:13.197
EXCLUSIVELY ABOUT CONSOLIDATION

00:47:13.263 --> 00:47:14.598
COMPETITION BECAUSE IT IS THE

00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:16.900
BIGGEST DRIVER OF THE PROBLEM

00:47:16.967 --> 00:47:18.335
AND THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT

00:47:18.402 --> 00:47:19.736
WE FAIL TO DO AS A NATION.

00:47:19.803 --> 00:47:21.438
FAILED TO. THE S. AND LIMóN

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:23.173
SPUR FREE MARKET ESPECIALLY

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.107
RELATED AROUND PRICE

00:47:24.174 --> 00:47:25.976
TRANSPARENCY WE FAIL TO PROTECT

00:47:26.043 --> 00:47:28.011
COMPETITION AND RIGOROUSLY

00:47:28.078 --> 00:47:29.146
ENFORCE OUR ANTI TRUST LAWS.

00:47:29.213 --> 00:47:30.747
WHEN WE TO REGULATE TO CONTROL

00:47:30.814 --> 00:47:32.883
PRICES WHEN COMPETITION NO

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:34.818
LONGER EXISTED. SO LET'S START

00:47:34.885 --> 00:47:35.385
WITH THE FAILURE TO PROTECT

00:47:35.452 --> 00:47:37.154
PRICE TRANSPARENCY AS MANY OF

00:47:37.221 --> 00:47:38.121
YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:47:38.188 --> 00:47:39.523
SURPRISE BILLING- THROUGHOUT

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:42.292
THE NATION. TWO THIRDS OF

00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:44.661
AMERICANS DON'T KNOW THE PRICE

00:47:44.728 --> 00:47:45.896
OF THEIR HEALTHCARE THEY CAN'T

00:47:45.963 --> 00:47:47.931
PLAN FOR IT THEY CAN'T. GET

00:47:47.998 --> 00:47:50.000
AROUND IT THIS THAT THE PRICES

00:47:50.067 --> 00:47:51.935
ARE NOT OEN AND AVAILABLE TO

00:47:52.002 --> 00:47:53.804
THEM. THE MOST PART FURTHERMORE

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:55.105
THIS IS BASED THROUGHOUT THE

00:47:55.172 --> 00:47:56.306
UNITED STATES A CATALYST FOR

00:47:56.373 --> 00:47:58.275
PAYMENT REFORM. AT PUTS OUT A

00:47:58.342 --> 00:47:59.743
PRICE TRANSPARENCY REPORT CARD

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:01.511
AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE IT IS THAT

00:48:01.578 --> 00:48:02.613
THE MAJORITY OF STATES

00:48:02.679 --> 00:48:04.181
INCLUDING CALIFORNIA GET A

00:48:04.248 --> 00:48:05.415
FAILING GRADE ON PROVIDING

00:48:05.482 --> 00:48:06.717
PRICED. PARENTS DO TO THEIR

00:48:06.783 --> 00:48:09.686
CONSUMERS. BUT THE POINT I MEAN

00:48:09.753 --> 00:48:12.589
TO YOU TODAY ABOUT PRIDE. ABOUT

00:48:12.656 --> 00:48:15.392
PRICE TRENDS. ARE PER PARENTS

00:48:15.459 --> 00:48:16.860
STRAWBERRY. IS REALLY MARKET

00:48:16.927 --> 00:48:18.829
POWER GLORY ALL. IT'S ABOUT THE

00:48:18.895 --> 00:48:20.864
BILL. I PROVIDER OR- AND SHE

00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:22.666
ORGAN WITH A LOT OF MARKET

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:24.434
POWER TO KEEP THOSE PRICES

00:48:24.501 --> 00:48:26.737
SECRET TO INCLUDE GAG CLAUSES

00:48:26.803 --> 00:48:28.272
IN THEIR CONTRACTS TO KEEP THEM

00:48:28.338 --> 00:48:29.940
SECRET AS WE SAW IN THE CENTER

00:48:30.007 --> 00:48:32.442
CASE BUT ALSO TO KEEP THEM

00:48:32.509 --> 00:48:33.510
SECRET USE OF TRADE SECRETS

00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:35.912
PROTECTIONS. I MIGHT ADD

00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:37.047
THEY'RE NOT SHALL AND I DON'T

00:48:37.114 --> 00:48:37.648
THINK THAT THEY WOULD ALWAYS

00:48:37.714 --> 00:48:39.950
STAND UP IN COURT BUT THE

00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:41.585
ANOTHER BEING USE AND SO THE

00:48:41.652 --> 00:48:43.020
QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET THIS

00:48:43.086 --> 00:48:44.488
MUCH MARKET POWER WHAT YOU CAN

00:48:44.554 --> 00:48:46.423
SEE ON THIS SLIDE IF YOU CAN

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:47.658
READ IT HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE IT

00:48:47.724 --> 00:48:49.326
IN YOUR NOTES. IS THE-

00:48:49.393 --> 00:48:51.595
BASICALLY FROM. NINETY ONE TO

00:48:51.662 --> 00:48:53.163
TWENTY ELEVEN. OVER TWENTY

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:56.099
YEARS. THE FTC DIDN'T WIN A

00:48:56.166 --> 00:48:58.135
SINGLE HOSPITAL MERGER CASE. HE

00:48:58.201 --> 00:48:59.670
DIDN'T WIN ONE AND IT COULD BE

00:48:59.736 --> 00:49:01.371
SICKLY COMES DOWN TO WHAT WAS A

00:49:01.438 --> 00:49:03.106
MISMATCH BETWEEN OUR ANY TRUST

00:49:03.173 --> 00:49:04.241
LAWS IN THE WAY THAT WE WERE

00:49:04.308 --> 00:49:06.009
LOOKING AT THEM WHAT WAS REALLY

00:49:06.076 --> 00:49:07.878
HAPPENING IN THE HOSPITAL

00:49:07.944 --> 00:49:11.615
MARKET BUT WHAT IT MEANT WAS

00:49:11.682 --> 00:49:14.217
THE FTC STOP BRING. KEITH

00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:16.787
SOURCES FOR THE- BUT THE SECOND

00:49:16.853 --> 00:49:18.188
THING THAT HAPPENED AS A RESULT

00:49:18.255 --> 00:49:19.756
OF THAT IS WE ENDED UP WITH

00:49:19.823 --> 00:49:20.891
HEALTH CARE MERGER MANIA

00:49:20.957 --> 00:49:22.492
EVERYBODY STARTED CONSOLIDATING

00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:24.828
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE AND SO WE

00:49:24.895 --> 00:49:25.395
SAW HOSPITAL'S MERGING WITH

00:49:25.462 --> 00:49:26.563
OTHER SPITTLE MERGING WITH

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:27.664
OTHER HOSPITALS FORMING HEALTH

00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:29.066
SYSTEMS AND THEN WE THOSE

00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:30.767
HEALTH SYSTEM STARTING TO

00:49:30.834 --> 00:49:32.969
ENGAGE IN VERTICAL MERGERS

00:49:33.036 --> 00:49:33.470
WHERE THEY WERE ACQUIRED

00:49:33.537 --> 00:49:35.138
FISHING GROUPS AND CLINICS AND

00:49:35.205 --> 00:49:36.506
STARTING TING. I KIND OF

00:49:36.573 --> 00:49:38.975
VERTICAL LINE AND NOW WHAT'S

00:49:39.042 --> 00:49:40.977
GROWTH ACROSS MARKET MERGERS

00:49:41.044 --> 00:49:42.079
WHERE. YOU KNOW HEALTHCARE

00:49:42.145 --> 00:49:43.880
SYSTEM IN SAID CISCO OR

00:49:43.947 --> 00:49:45.415
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA STARTS TO

00:49:45.482 --> 00:49:46.450
ACQUIRE KEY PROVIDER

00:49:46.516 --> 00:49:48.151
ORGANIZATIONS ARE KEY HOSPITALS

00:49:48.218 --> 00:49:50.053
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.155
WHAT W KNOW ABOUT ALL OF THIS

00:49:52.222 --> 00:49:54.224
CONSOLIDATION FROM THE DATA. IS

00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:56.226
IT THE PRICES GO UP AND THE

00:49:56.293 --> 00:49:57.994
QUALITY STAYS THE SAME OR IN

00:49:58.061 --> 00:50:00.230
SOME CASES GOES DOWN. SELECT

00:50:00.297 --> 00:50:01.064
TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:50:01.131 --> 00:50:03.033
ABOUT THAT. WITH HORIZONTAL THE

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.601
DATA IS VERY CLEAR WE SEE

00:50:04.668 --> 00:50:06.103
INCREASE PRICES ACROSS THE

00:50:06.169 --> 00:50:08.739
BOARD OF TWENTY 2404% FOLLOWING

00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:10.440
THE MERGER. WE SEE REDUCE

00:50:10.507 --> 00:50:11.541
QUALITY THESE MURDERS ARE

00:50:11.608 --> 00:50:15.178
STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH

00:50:15.245 --> 00:50:16.413
REDUCTIONS IN QUALITY INCLUDING

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:20.217
IN. HIGHER QUALITY. I'M TO SEE

00:50:20.283 --> 00:50:22.018
A PREMIUMS OF THIS IF DIRECTLY

00:50:22.085 --> 00:50:23.954
WHAT CONSUMERS PAY FOR THEIR

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:24.721
PRICE FOR THEIR PREMIUMS ON THE

00:50:24.788 --> 00:50:27.591
ACA MARKET. AND ALSO REDUCTIONS

00:50:27.657 --> 00:50:29.793
IN WAGE GROWTH FOR NURSES AND

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:30.861
ENVIRONMENT THIS WORKING IN

00:50:30.927 --> 00:50:33.730
THESE ORGANIZATIONS. FOR A

00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:35.599
VERTICAL MERGERS WE ALSO SEE

00:50:35.665 --> 00:50:37.033
HIGHER PRICES WE SEE HIGHER

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:38.201
PHYSICIAN PRICES AFTER

00:50:38.268 --> 00:50:39.870
ACQUISITION HIGHER CLINIC

00:50:39.936 --> 00:50:42.372
PRICES SOMETIMES AS MUCH AS

00:50:42.439 --> 00:50:43.273
FORTY SEVEN PERCENT. AFTER

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.409
ACQUISITION WE ALSO SEE THE

00:50:45.475 --> 00:50:47.077
WIRING HOSPITAL OUR HOSPITAL

00:50:47.144 --> 00:50:48.478
SYSTEM ALSO INCREASED THEIR

00:50:48.545 --> 00:50:51.648
PRICES AS FOLLOWING AN

00:50:51.715 --> 00:50:53.550
ACQUISITION OF A KEY PHYSICIAN

00:50:53.617 --> 00:50:56.620
GROUP. AND REALLY HERE IS WE

00:50:56.686 --> 00:50:59.723
SEE LIVE TO NO. AND WHAT THAT

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:00.824
REALLY MATTERS IS SOMETIMES

00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:02.659
THESE VERTICAL MERGERS ARE

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:04.828
JUSTIFIED ON THE BASIS OF THEIR

00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:05.829
GOING TO PROVIDE MORE

00:51:05.896 --> 00:51:08.231
EFFICIENCIES WHICH MEANS IS

00:51:08.298 --> 00:51:11.368
SUPPOSED TO MEAN LOWER PRICES

00:51:11.435 --> 00:51:12.769
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GO ON.

00:51:12.836 --> 00:51:14.905
DON'T SEE THAT. AND WE- AND

00:51:14.971 --> 00:51:18.742
JUST. MICHAEL IMPROVEMENT GOING

00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:19.376
TO STREAMLINE ALL THESE PROCEED

00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:20.444
IT'S GONNA BETTER FOR EVERY.

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:22.913
BUT WHAT THE DATA TELLS US AS

00:51:22.979 --> 00:51:24.347
WE DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING WE

00:51:24.414 --> 00:51:26.149
ONLY SEE HIGHER PRICES AND

00:51:26.216 --> 00:51:28.084
EITHER THE SAME OR NAY QUALITY

00:51:28.151 --> 00:51:29.286
IMPROVEMENT. THE OTHER THINK

00:51:29.352 --> 00:51:31.121
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO FOCUS

00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:33.990
ON WITH VERTICAL MERGERS. IS IT

00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:36.059
THE IN LIKELY TO TRIGGER. ANY

00:51:36.126 --> 00:51:37.828
VIEW IF YOU'RE ACQUIRING A

00:51:37.894 --> 00:51:40.497
PHYSICIAN GROUP IT DOESN'T AND

00:51:40.564 --> 00:51:43.667
TIMES IT THE THRESHOLD FOR THE

00:51:43.733 --> 00:51:44.634
HEART DINO ELLING SO THEY DON'T

00:51:44.701 --> 00:51:48.104
IT OFTEN DOESN'T. QUITE BY TO

00:51:48.171 --> 00:51:53.777
HAVE THIS TO THE FEDERAL. IN

00:51:53.844 --> 00:51:56.880
CALIFORNIA SO THE FLY BELOW ANY

00:51:56.947 --> 00:51:58.715
TRUST RATE ARE A LOT OF TIMES

00:51:58.782 --> 00:51:59.683
AND THIS CAN LEAD TO WHAT'S

00:51:59.749 --> 00:52:02.085
KNOWN AS STEP. VALIDATION WHERE

00:52:02.152 --> 00:52:03.854
GROUPS ARE AMASSING MARKET

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:06.156
WITHOUT A LOT OF ANTI TRUST AND

00:52:06.223 --> 00:52:08.925
NOTICE OF IT. SO LET ME ALSO

00:52:08.992 --> 00:52:10.126
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CROSS

00:52:10.193 --> 00:52:12.329
MARKET MERGERS BECAUSE THE BEEN

00:52:12.395 --> 00:52:14.231
GROWING A LOT IN NUMBER AND

00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:17.033
HISTORICALLY INTERESTING FORCES

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.101
HAVE THOUGHT THAT THERE'S NO

00:52:18.168 --> 00:52:19.669
POSSIBLE WAY THAT ACROSS MARKET

00:52:19.736 --> 00:52:21.471
MURDER COULD. PRICE INCREASES

00:52:21.538 --> 00:52:23.440
OR ANY COMPETITOR THEY HAVE

00:52:23.507 --> 00:52:25.308
PAID LITTLE TO NO ATTENTION TO

00:52:25.375 --> 00:52:27.143
THEM. BUT WHAT THE DATA TELLS

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:29.479
US IS THAT UNDERSTANDING IS NOT

00:52:29.546 --> 00:52:32.516
QUITE ACCURATE OR AT LEAST IT

00:52:32.582 --> 00:52:33.884
SUGGESTED THAT IT'S NOT

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:35.819
ACCURATE AND WELL. BEING

00:52:35.886 --> 00:52:36.453
FOLLOWING THESE MARKET MEASURES

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.655
IS INCREASE PRICES SEVENTY

00:52:38.722 --> 00:52:41.358
SEVEN. 9% FOR THE HOUSE THAT

00:52:41.424 --> 00:52:43.927
ARE REQUIRED. LET'S IS THAT

00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:44.494
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON

00:52:44.561 --> 00:52:46.162
HERE. MORE DATA AND MARK ON

00:52:46.229 --> 00:52:48.331
THIS BUT THERE'S DEFINITELY

00:52:48.398 --> 00:52:49.566
HAPPENING THERE THAT WE SHOULD

00:52:49.633 --> 00:52:52.135
BE PAYING INTENT. THE OTHER

00:52:52.202 --> 00:52:54.571
THING REALLY SAYING IS WE- THE

00:52:54.638 --> 00:52:56.907
FACT ON. IN MARK WHERE THE

00:52:56.973 --> 00:53:03.480
INDEPENDENT. ACQUIRED INDEED.

00:53:03.547 --> 00:53:07.083
QUITE BUT IT PASSED ALSO FOUND

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:08.184
IN THE MARK TO THEN IN THEIR

00:53:08.251 --> 00:53:10.186
PRICE I AND SO HE'S MERGERS ARE

00:53:10.253 --> 00:53:11.087
CAUSING PRICES OCCUR THE BOARD

00:53:11.154 --> 00:53:12.255
NOT IN JUST A AFFECTED HOSPITAL

00:53:12.322 --> 00:53:13.490
AND OBVIOUSLY NEED MORE DATE

00:53:13.557 --> 00:53:15.559
THAT BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT

00:53:15.625 --> 00:53:18.061
HAS BEEN FOUND. SO INCREASED

00:53:18.128 --> 00:53:19.262
WHEN HE HAS BEEN INCREASING IN

00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:20.497
CONSOLIDATION FAIRLY

00:53:20.564 --> 00:53:22.098
CONSISTENTLY AND YOU CAN WE

00:53:22.165 --> 00:53:23.266
WERE SORT OF MODERATELY

00:53:23.333 --> 00:53:25.135
CONSOLIDATED IN NORTHERN

00:53:25.201 --> 00:53:26.836
CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:53:26.903 --> 00:53:27.938
TEN BUT BY TWENTY SIXTEEN WE

00:53:28.004 --> 00:53:29.506
WERE VERY SIGNIFICANTLY AND

00:53:29.573 --> 00:53:32.375
HIGHLY CONSOLIDATED IN NORTHERN

00:53:32.442 --> 00:53:34.177
CALIFORNIA. NO THAT NO AS LARRY

00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:35.645
POINTED OUT BEFORE THIS LEADS

00:53:35.712 --> 00:53:37.047
TO ANY AN INCREASE PRICE

00:53:37.113 --> 00:53:38.648
DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN NORTHERN

00:53:38.715 --> 00:53:40.083
AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ON

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:41.518
AVERAGE OF ABOUT THIRTY THREE

00:53:41.585 --> 00:53:43.186
PERCENT. 3% HIGHER PRICES IN

00:53:43.253 --> 00:53:45.255
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- IN LARGE

00:53:45.322 --> 00:53:48.224
PART DUE TO THIS CONSOLIDATION.

00:53:48.291 --> 00:53:49.993
FURTHERMORE WE SEE THAT THE

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.962
DRIVER OF PRICE IS OUR

00:53:52.028 --> 00:53:53.897
HOSPITAL. IN A LARGE LARGEST.

00:53:53.964 --> 00:53:55.665
AND SO WE WERE THE HIGHER A

00:53:55.732 --> 00:53:58.468
CORRELATED ASPECT AS WELL AND

00:53:58.535 --> 00:53:59.302
SO WE'RE ALL OF THIS LEADS US

00:53:59.369 --> 00:54:02.472
HE IS IT OVERALL AS A NATION

00:54:02.539 --> 00:54:04.874
NINE OVER 90% OF OUR HOSPITAL

00:54:04.941 --> 00:54:07.077
GETS ARE HIGHLY CONCENTRATED.

00:54:07.143 --> 00:54:10.013
LOS PERCENT ORANGE MARKETS ARE

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.748
HIGHLY OR SUPER CONCENTRATED

00:54:11.815 --> 00:54:12.816
BUT IT DOESN'T STOP WITH JUST

00:54:12.882 --> 00:54:15.552
INSURERS AND HOSPITALS RIGHT

00:54:15.619 --> 00:54:16.486
OUR SPECIALIST POSITIONS ARE

00:54:16.553 --> 00:54:19.623
OVER 60% HIGHLY OR SUPER

00:54:19.689 --> 00:54:20.390
CONCENTRATED. AND THE NUMBER

00:54:20.457 --> 00:54:22.692
AND THE- TIONS THAT ARE

00:54:22.759 --> 00:54:24.127
BECOMING HIGHLY OR CONSUMER

00:54:24.194 --> 00:54:26.730
CONSOLIDATED IS ALSO GOING UP

00:54:26.796 --> 00:54:27.931
AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

00:54:27.998 --> 00:54:29.499
BECAUSE THEY MAKE A LOT OF

00:54:29.566 --> 00:54:30.634
REFERRALS AND SO THEY BECOME

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.969
THAT THE TARGET FOR A LOT OF

00:54:33.036 --> 00:54:34.704
WHAT'S- SO THE QUESTION NOW IS

00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:37.340
WHAT. TIME FIRST HAVE TO GET

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:39.142
YEAH AND SO I REALLY APPLY THE

00:54:39.209 --> 00:54:41.244
EFFORT TO CREATE AN ALL HERE

00:54:41.311 --> 00:54:41.878
CLAIMS DATABASE IN CALIFORNIA I

00:54:41.945 --> 00:54:44.481
THINK IT'S EXTRA IMPORT TALK A

00:54:44.547 --> 00:54:46.850
LITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT SECOND

00:54:46.916 --> 00:54:50.253
WE NEED TO ENHANCE OUR ANY INFO

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.756

COMPOSITION AND GET OF THE IS

00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:55.792
SO LET'S START WITH UP HERE

00:54:55.859 --> 00:55:00.163
CLAIMS DATA. SO ORIGINALLY ALL

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.797

WE SOON FOUND OUT WAS THAT THIS

00:55:07.804 --> 00:55:09.773
WAS WAY MORE USE FOR POLICY IN

00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:11.741
ENFORCEMENT. AND THE REALITY IS

00:55:11.808 --> 00:55:13.777
THE STATE OF CAN PROVIDE VERY

00:55:13.843 --> 00:55:15.278
ACCURATE INFORMATION ON THE

MERGER ASSIST VIEW AS WE'VE

THE USE OF LOW VALUE SERVICES

THAT AS WELL. THE WHOLE HOST OF

00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:43.440
THINGS THAT THE STATE CAN BE

00:55:43.506 --> 00:55:45.942
USED FOR I THINK IT WONDER

KIND OF CONSOLIDATION BEFORE IT

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.855
HAPPENS BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT

00:55:58.922 --> 00:56:01.458
WE HAVE BETTER NOTIFICATION OF

PROVIDE MONEY RELIEF AND IN THE

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:52.662
CENTER CASE WHICH- I BELIEVE

00:58:52.729 --> 00:58:55.465
THEY JUST DELAYED THE REPORTING

00:58:55.531 --> 00:58:57.467
OF THAT SETTLEMENT. BUT IS

00:58:57.533 --> 00:58:59.369
SUPPOSED TO BE AROUND FIVE

00:58:59.435 --> 00:58:59.903
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE

00:58:59.969 --> 00:59:01.771
MILLION DOLLARS SO. ALL OF

THESE THINGS ARE GOOD THINGS

00:59:03.273 --> 00:59:03.773
THAT CAN COME OUT OF THESE

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.675
CASES. BUT THE POINT I WANT TO

00:59:05.742 --> 00:59:06.910
MEET THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

00:59:06.976 --> 00:59:09.512
HIS VICTORIES IN LITIGATION

ARE. THEY'RE GREAT THEY'RE

00:59:11.881 --> 00:59:13.483
REALLY IMPORTANT BUT THEY ARE

00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:14.951
NOT THE ONLY THING WE CANNOT

00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:16.619
DECLARE VICTORY AT THE THOUGHT

00:59:16.686 --> 00:59:18.388
R. K. AND WALK AWAY FROM WHAT

00:59:18.454 --> 00:59:20.423

CASES WHERE THINGS GET REALLY

00:59:29.565 --> 00:59:31.734
BAD BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO HAVE

ENTIRETY. OF THE STATE AND- IF

00:59:35.972 --> 00:59:37.040
YOU THINK HEALTH EDUCATION AS

00:59:37.106 --> 00:59:39.409
TENDING TO ONE PLANT. TENDS THE

TIRE FARM YOU WANT YOUR GET THE

00:59:42.011 --> 00:59:44.314
ENTIRE FARM ENTRY WELL SO I

THINK IN THAT. CASE WE LOOKING.

00:59:47.083 --> 00:59:48.251
FROM THE WE DO THINGS

00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:49.552
LITIGATION WE NEED TO LOOK

00:59:49.619 --> 00:59:51.287
TOWARDS LEGISLATION. AND WHEN

00:59:51.354 --> 00:59:52.455
WE LOOK ACROSS ALL FIFTY STATES

00:59:52.522 --> 00:59:54.691
WHAT WE SEE IS THAT STATES ARE.

00:59:54.757 --> 00:59:56.926
KIND OF COMBINING THERE.

00:59:56.993 --> 00:59:58.528
EFFORTS ON THE AND LEGISLATIVE

SIDE INTO THREE BUCKETS SO THE

01:00:00.229 --> 01:00:01.898
FIRST IS TARGETING VERY

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:03.700
SPECIFIC MARKET IMPERFECTIONS

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:06.302
AND THESE ARE.LIKE THE ANY

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:08.271
COMPETITOR CONTRACT PROHIBITING

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:10.073
THOSE. WORD AN- THINGS LIKE

01:00:10.139 --> 01:00:11.674
THAT AND THEN ALSO THINGS LIKE

01:00:11.741 --> 01:00:13.743
SURPRISE BILLING LAWS RIGHT IN

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:15.111
TRYING TO. GET VERY. SICK AND

01:00:15.178 --> 01:00:18.815
IF YOU. GET BUT ALSO TO IMPROVE

01:00:18.881 --> 01:00:19.449
MARKET FUNCTION AND THIS IS BY

01:00:19.515 --> 01:00:20.917
INTRODUCED PRICED. INITIATIVES

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:23.119
ALL HERE CLAIMS DATABASES AND

01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:24.854
ALSO ENHANCING THEIR MERGER

01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:26.789
REVIEW SO IN CALIFORNIA. OUR

01:00:26.856 --> 01:00:28.925
MERGER REVIEW IN HEALTH CARE IS

01:00:28.992 --> 01:00:30.360
SORT OF DIVIDED UP DEPENDING ON

01:00:30.426 --> 01:00:32.228
THE ENTITIES THAT ARE MERGING.

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:34.063
IF IT'S NONPROFIT HOSPITALS THE

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:36.566
HE LOOKS AT IT IF IT'S DOMESTIC

01:00:36.632 --> 01:00:38.935
INSURERS CITY I LOOKED AT IT IF

01:00:39.002 --> 01:00:39.869
IT HEALTH SERVICE HEALTH

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:42.138
SERVICE PLAN CMHC LOOKED AT IT.

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:44.240
BUT WHAT WE SEE IS THERE. WE

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:45.608
DON'T HAVE ANYBODY THAT LOOKS

01:00:45.675 --> 01:00:47.176
SPECIFICALLY A FOR PROFIT

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:48.811
MERGERS WE DON'T HAVE ANYBODY

01:00:48.878 --> 01:00:54.150
THAT LOOKS. AT WHEN. HEALTH.

01:00:54.217 --> 01:00:55.952
THERE IS A BEFORE. PROVIDE AND

01:00:56.019 --> 01:00:57.320
THE WHERE WE'RE SEEING SOME AND

01:00:57.387 --> 01:00:58.554
WE DON'T HAVE A- NOTICE OF

01:00:58.621 --> 01:01:00.690
THOSE THINGS. AND SO SOMETHING

01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:02.225
FOR CALIFORNIA COULD LOOK AT IN

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:03.459
ENHANCING ITS MERGER REVIEW

01:01:03.526 --> 01:01:05.161
PROCESS WOULD BE TO REQUIRE

01:01:05.228 --> 01:01:07.063
NOTIFICATION TO THE STATE AG AS

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:08.598
ALL RIGHT- RHODE ISLAND AND

01:01:08.664 --> 01:01:11.000
HAWAII HAVE DONE. THEY REQUIRE

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:13.269
NOTIFICATION OF ALL TYPES OF

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:15.571
HOSPITAL MERGERS. AND THEN IS.

01:01:15.638 --> 01:01:16.839
IN CONNECTICUT WASHINGTON A

01:01:16.906 --> 01:01:18.174
MASSACHUSETTS REQUIRE

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:19.709
NOTIFICATION OF ANY MATERIAL

01:01:19.776 --> 01:01:21.010
CHANGE TO THIS INCLUDES A

01:01:21.077 --> 01:01:22.345
MERGER AND ACQUISITION BUT IT

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:24.380
ALSO INCLUDES. THOSE CONTRACT

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:26.015
AFFILIATIONS WHICH ARE JUST

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:27.617
SHORT OF A MERGER BUT THEY ARE

01:01:27.683 --> 01:01:28.684
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:30.119
NEGOTIATING PURPOSES AND I

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:32.455
THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:33.056
FOR US TO BE PAYING ATTENTION

01:01:33.122 --> 01:01:35.625
TO. THE OTHER THING THAT WE

01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:37.493
COULD DO IS WHAT RHODE ISLAND

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.595
AND HAWAII HAVE ALSO DONE TO

01:01:39.662 --> 01:01:42.098
REQUIRE BOTH NOTIFICATION ALSO

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:44.133
APPROVAL OF SOME STATE ENTITY

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.568
FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF MERGE THEY

01:01:45.635 --> 01:01:47.003
REQUIRE FOR ALL TYPES OF

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:48.004
HOSPITAL MERGERS BUT WE COULD

01:01:48.071 --> 01:01:52.742
REQUIRE IT- FOR THE GOLD MIND

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:54.510
HOSPITALS. AT THAT AND THEN

01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:55.878
FINALLY WE NEED TO BE THINKING

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:57.113
ABOUT MARKET REGULATION IN

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.916
AREAS WHERE MARKET HAS NOT-

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:00.917
WE'RE COMPETITION NO LONGER

01:02:00.983 --> 01:02:01.984
EXISTS AND YOU COULD THINK

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:05.021
ABOUT RATE REVIEW AS THEY

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:06.289
HAPPEN RHODE ISLAND. RATE CAPS

01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:08.091
FOR WRITERS. THAT IS SOMETHING

01:02:08.157 --> 01:02:10.093
OF INTEREST I INTRODUCING MORE

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:10.993
COMPETITION THROUGH A PUBLIC

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.963
OPTION OR- DIRECT CONTROLLING

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:16.132
PRICES THREE SINGLE PAYER. SO

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:17.633
OPTIONS CONSIDERATION WOULD BE

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.635
TO REQUIRE AG NOTIFICATION AND

01:02:19.702 --> 01:02:21.471
APPROVAL OF ALL HEALTH CARE

01:02:21.537 --> 01:02:23.473
CONSOLIDATION ACTIVITY- BUT YOU

01:02:23.539 --> 01:02:25.408
COULD TEAR IT BY LEVEL OF

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:27.343
IMPORTANCE ARE POTENTIAL RISK

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:29.512
TO COMPETITION. AMENDING THE

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.314
STATE ANTI TRUST LAW THE CARD

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:32.982
RIGHT ACT TO ALLOW THE AG TO

01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:34.350
CHALLENGE MURDERS IN STATE

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:36.752
COURT UNDER STATE LAW AND THEN

01:02:36.819 --> 01:02:38.421

THE BILLS TO COME IN BY IDEA

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:03.139
WITH ANYTHING IT'S GOING TO

01:04:03.206 --> 01:04:06.542

DOESN'T NECESSARILY. THERE

01:04:33.603 --> 01:04:34.704
NECESSARILY REFLECT THE

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:37.139
NEGOTIATED RATE. PLAN SO WE SEE

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:39.208
THE PRICE GOING UP. BY THE

GENERATING PRETTY HUGE PROFITS-

01:05:19.882 --> 01:05:21.217
COMPARED TO WHAT THEIR

01:05:21.284 --> 01:05:22.018
COUNTERPARTS IN SOUTHERN

GRAPH YOU CAN SEE. THAT THAT

01:11:44.033 --> 01:11:48.203
MEETING 33% BUT IF THE SAVINGS

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:50.973
A PREMIUM HAD BEEN PASSED ON TO

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.509

INCOMES WOULD HAVE GONE UP

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:01.750
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE AND SOLVING

01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:04.319
ONE OF OUR MORE BROAD PROBLEMS

01:12:04.386 --> 01:12:05.888
WHICH IS STAGNATING INCOME

GROWTH AND INCOME INEQUALITY

01:12:08.323 --> 01:12:10.059
THE EFFECTS OF THESE KINDS OF

01:12:10.125 --> 01:12:12.294
SAVINGS EVEN BE GREAT I LOOK.

01:12:12.361 --> 01:12:18.267
THEM RIGHT. NOT ALWAYS FROM A

01:12:18.333 --> 01:12:19.868
STATES THAT A MIXED APPROACH

01:12:19.935 --> 01:12:21.904
WORKS BEST ONE THAT COMBINES

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:25.374
TARGETS DATA AND ENFORCEMENT

01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:27.576

01:13:41.116 --> 01:13:42.918
THAT WE SAW ACROSS ALL STATES

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:44.820

THIS- I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE

01:15:27.222 --> 01:15:28.991
CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF WHAT WE-

01:15:29.057 --> 01:15:32.594
DOING IN MASSACHUSETTS. CAN BE

01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:34.930
A DOUBLE. ANY TYPES OF STATES

01:15:34.997 --> 01:15:37.165
THE SIZE DAY THERE MARKET FROM

01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:39.601
A STATE AS SMALL AS DELLA TO

PRETTY FULL I KIND OF KNOW HOW

MANY. CAN LEAD THAT SUCCESS. A

01:15:53.749 --> 01:15:54.883
LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND HERE

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:57.019
ABOUT WHY WE DECIDED TO TAKE ON

01:15:57.085 --> 01:15:59.021
HEALTHCARE COSTS- SO

01:15:59.087 --> 01:16:00.789
MASSACHUSETTS WAS A FOUR

01:16:00.856 --> 01:16:03.392
RUNNER- FOR HEALTH CARE JUST

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:04.927
REFORM WE PASSED UNIVERSAL

01:16:04.993 --> 01:16:06.728
ACCESS REFORM IN TWO THOUSAND

01:16:06.795 --> 01:16:08.864
AND SIX. WHICH BECAME A MODEL

01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:10.832
FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT-

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:12.301
AND HAD A LARGE DEAL SUCCESS

01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:15.137
AND THAT AFTER GETTING. MOST BE

01:16:15.203 --> 01:16:16.872
THE NIGHT EIGHT POINT FIVE IN

01:16:16.939 --> 01:16:18.707
SHORT THANK YOU TO HAVE THE

01:16:18.774 --> 01:16:21.076
LOWEST RATE OF UNINSURED STATE

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:22.878
IN THE COUNTRY. HOWEVER A

01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:24.012
SUBSEQUENT SUCCESS OF THAT

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:26.214
ACCESS. THE CHALLENGE OF

01:16:26.281 --> 01:16:29.751
SUSTAINING KNOW FOURTEEN. CAME

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:31.954
EVEN MORE. AS AN ANSWER. ANY

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.289
MORE OF A CHALLENGE OF NEEDED

01:16:34.356 --> 01:16:36.124
TO FACE. AND SO WHAT THIS GRAPH

01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:41.196
HERE SHOWS IS PERSON HELP

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:43.665
ACOSTA. IN MASS. IN TWO NINE

01:16:43.732 --> 01:16:44.466
WERE THE HIGHEST ANY IN THE

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:46.568
STATES. YEAH AS HAS BEEN

01:16:46.635 --> 01:16:48.136
MENTIONED AND WARY MENTION I

01:16:48.203 --> 01:16:48.870
THINK AT THE BEGINNING THE

01:16:48.937 --> 01:16:51.006
UNITED STATES HAS OBVIOUSLY THE

01:16:51.073 --> 01:16:52.507
HIGHEST PER PACK PER PERSON

01:16:52.574 --> 01:16:53.942
HEALTHCARE COSTS OF ALL

01:16:54.009 --> 01:16:56.578
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES SO IN TWO

01:16:56.645 --> 01:16:57.212
THOUSAND NINE MASSACHUSETTS WAS

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:58.347
LITERALLY PROBABLY THE MOST

01:16:58.413 --> 01:17:00.582
EXPENSIVE PLACE ON THE PLANET-

01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:01.883
TO RECEIVE HEALTHCARE. AND WAS

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:03.685
GROWING AT AN UNSUSTAINABLE

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:05.554
RATE AND A RATE THAT WAS NOT

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:07.556
GOING TO BE AFFORDABLE NOT JUST

01:17:07.622 --> 01:17:09.524
STATE GOVERNMENT. BUT FOR THE

01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:11.226
EMPLOYER BUSINESS IS

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:12.327
MASSACHUSETTS ESPECIALLY OUR

01:17:12.394 --> 01:17:14.763
SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE OF

01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:16.298
OUR ECONOMY FOR FAMILIES AN

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:18.433
INDIVIDUAL. FOR ANYONE WHO'S

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.902
SEEN ANY WAGE GROWTH IN REVENUE

01:17:20.969 --> 01:17:25.073
GROUP JUST COMPLETELY SWAMPED.

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:28.410
RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS. AND SO

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:30.012
WE SET. WE NEED TO THIS

01:17:30.078 --> 01:17:31.246
HEALTHCARE PROP AND PASS

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:32.614
ANOTHER BIG OF LEAD TO TRY TO

01:17:32.681 --> 01:17:33.982
REALLY CREATE A MORE

01:17:34.049 --> 01:17:36.184
SUSTAINABLE AND AFFORDABLE PATH

01:17:36.251 --> 01:17:37.619
FOR THE FUTURE SO THAT WE CAN

01:17:37.686 --> 01:17:38.920
KEEP THIS PROMISE TO OUR

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:40.589
RESIDENTS WE SAID WE WANT TO

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:42.124
GET HAVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE BUT

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:43.759
IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT. THAT'S

01:17:43.825 --> 01:17:45.060
NOT COVERAGE AT ALL THAT'S NOT

01:17:45.127 --> 01:17:47.863
TRUE ACCESS SO IN TWO THOUSAND

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:49.965
AND TWELVE WE PASSED A

01:17:50.032 --> 01:17:50.432
COMPREHENSIVE PIECE OF

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:53.335
LEGISLATION. WHICH HAS ADDED

01:17:53.402 --> 01:17:54.703
CENTER AND ITS ORGANIZING

01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:56.872
PRINCIPLE THIS IDEA OF THE

01:17:56.938 --> 01:17:58.206
HEALTH CARE COST GROWTH

01:17:58.273 --> 01:18:00.509
BENCHMARK. AND THIS IS A TARGET

01:18:00.575 --> 01:18:03.145
BY WHICH WE ARE SETTING IN LAW-

01:18:03.211 --> 01:18:05.013
TO TRY TO HAVE TOTAL HEALTHCARE

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.582
SPENDING GROW ADDED ANNUAL AND

01:18:07.649 --> 01:18:09.084
MORE SUSTAINABLE RATE. AND AS

01:18:09.151 --> 01:18:10.318
GLENN MENTIONED WE DO T&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;

01:18:10.385 --> 01:18:12.687
THAT- TO WHAT WE PROJECT IN

01:18:12.754 --> 01:18:15.023
TERMS OF. THE OVERALL GROWTH IN

01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:16.291
OUR STATE'S ECONOMY IN THE LONG

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:17.993
TERM AND THE IDEA THEIR WORDS

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:19.761
AGAIN KIND OF THIS CROWDING OUT

01:18:19.828 --> 01:18:22.464
IDEA. THAT IF HEALTH CARE CAN

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:24.633
AND SHOULD GROW. OUT BECAUSE OF

01:18:24.699 --> 01:18:25.600
THEIR INNOVATION BECAUSE OF

01:18:25.667 --> 01:18:28.036
INFLATION BECAUSE OF-

01:18:28.103 --> 01:18:30.238
TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS. BUT

01:18:30.305 --> 01:18:32.040
SHOULD TO GROW TWICE AS FAST AS

01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:32.741
EVERYTHING ELSE AND WHAT DOES

01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:34.242
THAT MEAN FOR ABILITY TO MAKE

01:18:34.309 --> 01:18:36.344
AN ESTIMATES. HI AGAIN AS AN

01:18:36.411 --> 01:18:38.280
EMPLOYER FAMILY OR GOVERNMENT

01:18:38.346 --> 01:18:41.650
IN OTHER ELEMENTS WHEN THAT IS

01:18:41.716 --> 01:18:42.350
GROWING SO MUCH FASTER. THE

01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:43.919
LAST THING I WOULD DO ON THIS.

01:18:43.985 --> 01:18:45.420
IS A- STATEMENT THAT WE HAVE

01:18:45.487 --> 01:18:48.290
HERE. WHICH IS AROUND A YOU

01:18:48.356 --> 01:18:49.458
KNOW I TRANSPARENT IN

01:18:49.524 --> 01:18:50.892
INNOVATIVE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

01:18:50.959 --> 01:19:04.072
THAT IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR. HELLO.

01:19:04.139 --> 01:19:05.974
SAVING MONEY AND IMPROVING THE

01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:07.676
HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND

01:19:07.742 --> 01:19:10.212
IMPROVING ACCESS AND REDUCING

01:19:10.278 --> 01:19:12.214
DISPARITIES INEQUITIES THAT WE

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:13.815
KNOW ARE INHERENT IN OUR

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:14.749
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ACROSS THE

01:19:14.816 --> 01:19:16.485
UNITED STATES. WE CAN SAVE

01:19:16.551 --> 01:19:18.954
MONEY AND TOTALLY COMPROMISE

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:20.222
OUR QUALITY AND COMPROMISE OUR

01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:22.190
ACCESS WE WILL HAVE FAILED AND

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:23.291
THAT WILL BE IN CONSISTENT WITH

01:19:23.358 --> 01:19:27.529
OUR VALUES AS A STATE. SO HOW

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:28.163
CAN WE FIND THOSE STRATEGIES TO

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:32.300
HAVE. TO YES OVER TIME BUT

01:19:32.367 --> 01:19:33.835
ACTUALLY THEN BE ABLE TO

01:19:33.902 --> 01:19:35.337
CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN

01:19:35.403 --> 01:19:37.105
AREAS WHERE WE NEED TO AREAS

01:19:37.172 --> 01:19:38.106
THAT HAVE BEEN HISTOICALLY

01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:40.041
UNDER INVEST IN LIKE PRIMARY

01:19:40.108 --> 01:19:42.244
CARE AND THEY HAVE A HEALTH

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:42.878
CARE AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER

01:19:42.944 --> 01:19:45.113
CARE. SO LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:47.149
THIS IDEA OF THIS BENCHMARK-

01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:50.785
SO. THIS IS A IT IS A TARGET IT

01:19:50.852 --> 01:19:53.021
IS NOT A CáC WE CAN EXCEEDED

01:19:53.088 --> 01:19:54.890
IT IN ANY GIVEN YEAR AND ALSO

01:19:54.956 --> 01:19:57.225
YOU THAT ACTUALLY HAVE- BUT IT

01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:59.161
IS SET IN LAW AND IT IS

01:19:59.227 --> 01:20:00.896
SOMETHING THAT AGAIN WAS TIED

01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:02.164
INITIAL. DO ECONOMIC GROWTH

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:04.799
RATE OF A THREE POINT 6% ANNUAL

01:20:04.866 --> 01:20:06.168
TARGET. AND THIS IS A

01:20:06.234 --> 01:20:08.036
SIGNIFICANT AN AMBITIOUS GOAL-

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:09.504
EVEN AS LARRY SAID THAT HEALTH

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:11.273
CARE COST GROWTH HAVE MODERATED

01:20:11.339 --> 01:20:12.407
IN RECENT YEARS. FOR

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:14.543
MASSACHUSETTS. YOU KNOW WE WERE

01:20:14.609 --> 01:20:16.778
CLOSE TO DOUBLE DIGIT YEAR OVER

01:20:16.845 --> 01:20:18.847
YEAR SPENDING GROWTH. AND

01:20:18.914 --> 01:20:20.415
MASSACHUSETTS HEALTHCARE IS OUR

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:22.417
NUMBER ONE EMPLOYER IT'S A

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:23.685
SIXTY BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:25.720
INDUSTRY- AND SO PERCENTAGE

01:20:25.787 --> 01:20:28.557
POINTS MATTER- AND ULTIMATELY

01:20:28.623 --> 01:20:30.425
WHITES HEALTH CARE COST

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:32.093
CONTAINMENT IS THAT CHALLENGES

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.562
ONE PERSON'S. ACOSTA IS ANOTHER

01:20:33.628 --> 01:20:35.697
ORGANIZATIONS REVENUE THAT THEY

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:37.199
COUNT ON FOR DELIVERING THEIR

01:20:37.265 --> 01:20:39.201
MISSION. AND SO WE WANTED TO BE

01:20:39.267 --> 01:20:40.802
ABLE TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT

01:20:40.869 --> 01:20:43.104
THIS TO HAVE AND IN. BUT IT SHE

01:20:43.171 --> 01:20:44.739
WILL ARCHITECT TRACKING MONITOR

01:20:44.806 --> 01:20:46.641
OVER TIME. AND THE LAW ACTUALLY

01:20:46.708 --> 01:20:47.876
ALLOWED FOR AFTER A COUPLE OF

01:20:47.943 --> 01:20:49.177
YEARS THAT WE WOULD ACTUALLY BE

01:20:49.244 --> 01:20:50.045
ABLE TO MOVE TO A MORE

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:52.013
AGGRESSIVE TARGET OF THREE

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.715
POINT 1% TO SAY. HOW DO WE

01:20:53.782 --> 01:20:58.119
CONTINUE TO. PUSH THE ENVELOPE

01:20:58.186 --> 01:21:02.791
IN WELL TO GET A SAVINGS OUT OF.

01:21:02.857 --> 01:21:03.992
NOW THIS IS BECAUSE- THE WAY WE

01:21:04.059 --> 01:21:05.293
WORK THINKING ABOUT TOTAL

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:06.861
HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES THIS IS

01:21:06.928 --> 01:21:09.331
ALL IN. IT IS THIS WHAT WE

01:21:09.397 --> 01:21:10.332
SPEND ON THE STATE'S MEDICAID

01:21:10.398 --> 01:21:12.968
PROGRAM. IT'S EMPLOYER

01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:13.602
SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE IT'S

01:21:13.668 --> 01:21:15.437
OUR MEDICARE PROGRAM IT IS THE

01:21:15.503 --> 01:21:17.439
KNACK COSTS THE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:21:17.505 --> 01:21:18.540
COSTS OF OUR PRIVATE HEALTH

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:19.975
INSURANCE. AND IT'S WHAT PEOPLE

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:21.576
PAY FOR THEIR COPAYS AND

01:21:21.643 --> 01:21:23.144
DEDUCTIBLES AND THEIR COST

01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:24.946
SHARING OUT OF POCKET. OUT ALL

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:26.648
OF THAT UP WE TRACK ITS GROWTH

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.750
MERE OVER HERE. AND THAT IS

01:21:28.817 --> 01:21:29.784
THAT IS WHAT WE'RE MEASURING SO

01:21:29.851 --> 01:21:31.920
IT'S A REALLY IT'S A BIG ALL IN

01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:33.688
NUMBER. AND IMPORTANCE OF THAT

01:21:33.755 --> 01:21:35.690
IS A COMMON PROBLEM IN

01:21:35.757 --> 01:21:37.559
HEALTHCARE POLICY WHICH WE

01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:39.060
OFTEN SOMETIMES CALLED THE

01:21:39.127 --> 01:21:41.896
BALLOON PROBLEM OR THE WHACK A

01:21:41.963 --> 01:21:44.733
MOLE PROBLEM THAT IT JUST PUSHY

01:21:44.799 --> 01:21:51.006
COUNTER JUST. BROKE ONE OF CARE

01:21:51.072 --> 01:21:53.875
THAT IS REALLY GOOD SOMETHING

01:21:53.942 --> 01:21:57.846
HAVE. PLACE BEING CURD IT'S NOT.

01:21:57.912 --> 01:22:02.751
BACK OUT. AND WE REALLY. HAVE

01:22:02.817 --> 01:22:08.623
BEEN ALL OF YOU. ALL IN AS I

01:22:08.690 --> 01:22:11.393
SAID BUT WE CAN DO HAVE AN

01:22:11.459 --> 01:22:13.695
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM FOR

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:15.196
INDIVIDUAL HEALTH SYSTEMS AN

01:22:15.263 --> 01:22:17.032
INDIVIDUAL HEALTH PLANS

01:22:17.098 --> 01:22:19.567
INSURANCE COMPANIES TO SAY THAT

01:22:19.634 --> 01:22:21.736
THEY ARE ALSO ACCOUNTABLE TO

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:23.204
TRY TO KEEP HEALTHCARE SPENDING

01:22:23.271 --> 01:22:25.307
GROWTH TO A MORE SUSTAINABLE

01:22:25.373 --> 01:22:27.676
RIGHT AND SO EVERY YEAR WE- ARE

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:30.545
IDENTIFIED A LIST OF THOSE

01:22:30.612 --> 01:22:31.880
HEALTHCARE BIG HEALTHCARE

01:22:31.946 --> 01:22:33.315
SYSTEMS AND HOW INSURANCE

01:22:33.381 --> 01:22:35.417
COMPANIES WHOSE COSTS GROWTH

01:22:35.483 --> 01:22:37.118
HAVE EXCEEDED THE BENCHMARK.

01:22:37.185 --> 01:22:39.354
AND WE CAN I HAVE THE AUTHORITY

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:41.489
AT OUR COMMISSION TO A REQUIRE

01:22:41.556 --> 01:22:43.391
THEM TO TAKE STEPS TO ADDRESS

01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:44.292
THEIR HEALTHCARE SPENDING

01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:45.427
GROWTH IN A PUBLIC AND

01:22:45.493 --> 01:22:47.962
TRANSPARENT AND REPORTED WAY A

01:22:48.029 --> 01:22:49.297
WHAT WE CALL PERFORMANCE

01:22:49.364 --> 01:22:50.632
IMPROVEMENT PLAN COULD

01:22:50.699 --> 01:22:51.866
OTHERWISE WE CALL THE

01:22:51.933 --> 01:22:53.335
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN BUT

01:22:53.401 --> 01:22:56.271
REALLY IT THIS IS A- BASICALLY

01:22:56.338 --> 01:22:59.441
SAYING WE'VE I DON'T THERE'S AN

01:22:59.507 --> 01:23:05.180
HERE. AND CITY OF. PROVIDE WHEN

01:23:05.246 --> 01:23:08.216
DID YOU. YOUR HELP STRUCK THE

01:23:08.283 --> 01:23:11.786
MINE. TRACK AND WE'RE GONNA

01:23:11.853 --> 01:23:12.721
MINOR WE'RE GOING TO HOLD YOU

01:23:12.787 --> 01:23:14.589
PUBLIC TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT. I

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:15.857
WOULD NOTE HERE THIS IS KIND OF

01:23:15.924 --> 01:23:17.826
ARC AVAIL TOOL AND WE HAVE NOT

01:23:17.892 --> 01:23:21.863
HAD TO THIS TOOL WE HAVE HAD IT

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:23.631
IN FACT AND WE HAVE GOT THESE

01:23:23.698 --> 01:23:24.999
LESS WE HAVE GONE THROUGH A

01:23:25.066 --> 01:23:26.234
WE'VE HAD BACK FORTH WITH

01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:28.136
HEALTH PLAN AND HEALTH. BUT WE

01:23:28.203 --> 01:23:28.737
HAVE NOT ACTUALLY TO TAKE THE

01:23:28.803 --> 01:23:30.205
ADDITIONAL STAFF AND AB ONE

01:23:30.271 --> 01:23:30.939
THING I WOULD SAY IS THERE IS A

01:23:31.005 --> 01:23:33.908
SUDDEN FACT A KNOWING WE ARE

01:23:33.975 --> 01:23:36.177
WHAT. THAT ARE TRACKING AND

01:23:36.244 --> 01:23:39.748
THERE CAN BE IN MECHANISM THAT

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:41.116
WE HAVE FOUND CAN TO IN

01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:43.351
INFLUENCE BUT WITHOUT TO

01:23:43.418 --> 01:23:46.988
NECESSARILY THAT IT SOME STUFF.

01:23:47.055 --> 01:23:51.993
THAT OF IN ASK. CAN CHANGE

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:54.829
BEHAVIOR SO AGAIN WE TRY OF

01:23:54.896 --> 01:23:57.632
THIS NOT NOT AS A AS BUT AS A

01:23:57.699 --> 01:23:59.934
TO SAY WE'RE ALL IN THIS

01:24:00.001 --> 01:24:01.770
TOGETHER HOWEVER ALL WERE

01:24:01.836 --> 01:24:06.641
TOWARDS THESE GOALS. I'M NOT.

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:10.645
THIS IS AN- WHOLE PROCESS. WALK

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:20.889
ALL THE. THIS IS MARK. EVERY

01:24:20.955 --> 01:24:23.124
YEAR WHERE WE CAN CALL- THE

01:24:23.191 --> 01:24:25.160
LEADERSHIP OF OUR BIGGEST

01:24:25.226 --> 01:24:27.128
HEALTH SYSTEMS AND HEALTH PLANS

01:24:27.195 --> 01:24:29.597
TO COME AND TESTIFY NOT ON LIKE

01:24:29.664 --> 01:24:32.333
THIS- UNDER OATH- IN A PUBLIC

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:33.201
SETTING ABOUT WHAT THEIR

01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:36.037
ORGANIZATIONS ARE DOING TO TRY

01:24:36.104 --> 01:24:36.738
TO HELP MEET THE HEALTH CARE

01:24:36.805 --> 01:24:39.140
COST GROWTH BENCHMARK AND WHERE

01:24:39.207 --> 01:24:40.275
DO THEY EITHER CHALLENGES

01:24:40.341 --> 01:24:43.912
AMERICA THEY USE HELP POTENTIAL.

01:24:43.978 --> 01:24:45.947
AND SO CAN BE. COMMUNITY COM.

01:24:46.014 --> 01:24:47.615
ABOUT HOW ALL OF US ARE WORKING

01:24:47.682 --> 01:24:49.818
TOGETHER. TO TRY TO ACHIEVE

01:24:49.884 --> 01:24:53.021
THIS GOAL WE THEN HAVE THE WE

01:24:53.087 --> 01:24:54.956
ISSUE OUR OWN ANNUAL REPORT

01:24:55.023 --> 01:24:56.624
THAT DOES DEEPER DIVE INTO SOME

01:24:56.691 --> 01:24:58.526
OF THOSE AREAS OF SIGNIFICANT

01:24:58.593 --> 01:24:59.961
YOU KNOW DRIVERS OF HEALTH CARE

01:25:00.028 --> 01:25:01.696
SPENDING. AND MAKE POLICY

01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:02.630
RECOMMENDATIONS TO OUR

01:25:02.697 --> 01:25:03.631
LEGISLATURE TO OUR

01:25:03.698 --> 01:25:05.567
ADMINISTRATION AND TO THE

01:25:05.633 --> 01:25:08.136
MARKET A BIG PART OF THIS- IS

01:25:08.203 --> 01:25:09.971
AS AN INDEPENDENT AGENTS WHICH

01:25:10.038 --> 01:25:11.973
I'LL TALK ABOUT IN A SECOND- WE

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.541
WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE DATA

01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:16.144
AND INFORMATION TO ALL OF THE

01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:17.111
MOST IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDERS

01:25:17.178 --> 01:25:20.515
INCLUDING THE BUDGET. TO MAKE.

01:25:20.582 --> 01:25:21.916
WHAT THE DATA ALSO. AND HOW CAN

01:25:21.983 --> 01:25:24.319
WE I REALLY HAVE DATA INFORMS

01:25:24.385 --> 01:25:25.954
POLICY MAKING NOT ANECDOTE

01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:27.322
INFORMED POLICY MAKING AND

01:25:27.388 --> 01:25:28.122
THAT'S A BIG PART OF HAT WE

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:29.858
TRY TO ACCOMPLISH. AND THAT CAN

01:25:29.924 --> 01:25:31.593
CHANGE OVER TIME. AND SO ONCE

01:25:31.659 --> 01:25:33.294
YOU BUILD THAT INFRASTRUCTURE

01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:34.262
BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT DATA

01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:36.364
UNDERSTANDING. AS HEALTHCARE

01:25:36.431 --> 01:25:38.900
SYSTEM IS RAPIDLY CHANGING. THE

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:40.168
PROBLEMS THAT WE THINK WE KNOW

01:25:40.235 --> 01:25:42.136
NOW COULD BE VERY DIFFERENT

01:25:42.203 --> 01:25:44.239
FROM FOR FIVE YEARS FROM NOW.

01:25:44.305 --> 01:25:45.807
AND HAVING THIS ABILITY TO

01:25:45.874 --> 01:25:47.642
NIMBLE AND TO BE FLEXIBLE AND

01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:49.611
TO GO WHERE THE TREND TAKE US.

01:25:49.677 --> 01:25:51.145
ALLOWS US TO THEN BE ABLE TO

01:25:51.212 --> 01:25:52.180
ADAPT OUR POLICY

01:25:52.247 --> 01:25:54.649
RECOMMENDATIONS YEAR OVER YEAR

01:25:54.716 --> 01:25:55.950
ALONG WITH A DEADLY CHANGING

01:25:56.017 --> 01:25:57.352
HEALTHCARE MARK. NOT IN IN IN

01:25:57.418 --> 01:26:00.021
IN FIGHTING WITH THAT. SO THE

01:26:00.088 --> 01:26:01.322
HEALTH POLICY COMMISSION IS UP

01:26:01.389 --> 01:26:03.124
I KNEW STATE AGENCY THAT WAS

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:03.925
ESTABLISHED AS PART OF THIS

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:06.027
OUGHT TO REALLY. MONITOR AND TO

01:26:06.094 --> 01:26:07.829
BE THE HUB FOR ALL OF THE

01:26:07.896 --> 01:26:09.531
ACTIVITIES TO TRY TO HELP US

01:26:09.597 --> 01:26:12.300
ACHIEVE THE BENCHMARK- IT WAS A

01:26:12.367 --> 01:26:13.902
NEW STATE AGENCY AT THE TIME AN

01:26:13.968 --> 01:26:16.337
INDEPENDENT STATE AGENCY. I WAS

01:26:16.404 --> 01:26:18.773
THE FIRST EMPLOYEE THIS A STATE

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.808
AGENCY THIS WAS TRULY A START

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:24.145
UP- WITH A VERY AMBITIOUS GOAL-

01:26:24.212 --> 01:26:27.115
BUT I WASN'T IN THE SOUL- I

01:26:27.181 --> 01:26:28.049
THAT I HAVE A BOARD THAT I

01:26:28.116 --> 01:26:29.484
WILL. DO THAT IS MADE UP OF

01:26:29.551 --> 01:26:30.618
APPOINTMENTS BY THE GOVERNOR

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:32.253
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON OUR

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.756
STATE AUDITOR ALL. INDIVIDUALLY

01:26:34.822 --> 01:26:35.590
CONSTITUTIONALLY ELECTED

01:26:35.657 --> 01:26:39.227
OFFICERS AND TWO SETS. AND EACH

01:26:39.294 --> 01:26:40.895
ONE OF THOSE. CAN A POINTS- A

01:26:40.962 --> 01:26:42.130
CERTAIN NUMBER OF MEMBERS HERE

01:26:42.196 --> 01:26:44.165
AND THEIR EXPERTISE IS LAID OUT

01:26:44.232 --> 01:26:45.500
IN LOSS WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO. IS

01:26:45.567 --> 01:26:47.402
A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN IF

01:26:47.468 --> 01:26:48.403
SOMEONE WHO IS AN EXPERT ON

01:26:48.469 --> 01:26:49.470
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE EXPERT

01:26:49.537 --> 01:26:52.073
ON HEALTH COM ECONOMICS- A

01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:54.108
WORKFORCE EXPERT. AND I DON'T

01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:55.143
REALLY REFLECT YOU KNOW AYE

01:26:55.209 --> 01:26:56.978
DIVERSE RANGE OF DIFFERENT

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:59.213
PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERTISE. BUT

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.415
NOT ONE OF THOSE CONSTITUTIONAL

01:27:00.481 --> 01:27:02.183
OFFICERS HAS A MAJORITY OF THE

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:04.619
BOARD. AND THE BOARD WAS

01:27:04.686 --> 01:27:07.322
INITIALLY HAD STAGGERED TERMS

01:27:07.388 --> 01:27:10.825
AND THE REASON BEHIND THAT WAS

01:27:10.892 --> 01:27:12.961
TO INSURE. POLITICAL

01:27:13.027 --> 01:27:14.028
INDEPENDENCE AT IS I'M-

01:27:14.095 --> 01:27:16.631
PARTISAN STATE AGENCY- AND WE

01:27:16.698 --> 01:27:18.866
VIEW OUR GOALS AS REALLY BEING

01:27:18.933 --> 01:27:21.002
FOR THE PUBLIC AND SO I'VE-

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:22.203
PUTTING SOME OF THESE KIND OF

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:24.505
STRUCTURES IN PLACE- WE WORK

01:27:24.572 --> 01:27:25.807
VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR

01:27:25.873 --> 01:27:27.742
LEGISLATURE AND EXECUTIVE- BUT

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:28.943
WE ARE I DO NOT REPORT UP TO

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:31.913
THEM- AND IN FACT OUR BOARD HAS

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:33.281
SOME LEVEL OF INDEPENDENCE.

01:27:33.348 --> 01:27:34.782
FROM THAT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

01:27:34.849 --> 01:27:37.785
HARD DECISIONS SOMETIMES- AS IS

01:27:37.852 --> 01:27:40.588
INEVITABLE- WHEN DEALING WITH

01:27:40.655 --> 01:27:41.189
HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT.

01:27:41.255 --> 01:27:42.690
I'M ONE LAST THING I WOULD VERY.

01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:44.859
ON MY BOARD IS THAT THERE IS-

01:27:44.926 --> 01:27:46.494
STRONG FINANCIAL CONFLICT OF

01:27:46.561 --> 01:27:48.396
INTEREST PROTECTIONS SO OUR

01:27:48.463 --> 01:27:49.631
BOARD MEMBERS CANNOT BE PEOPLE

01:27:49.697 --> 01:27:51.733
WHO ARE EMPLOYED BY OUR BIGGEST

01:27:51.799 --> 01:27:53.501
HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS OR VIGOROUS.

01:27:53.568 --> 01:27:55.536
HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS AGAIN

01:27:55.603 --> 01:27:56.704
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WANT

01:27:56.771 --> 01:27:58.606
PEOPLE WHO ARE BRINGING THAT

IS THE BENCHMARK ITSELF. IS IT

01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:31.112
DOESN'T SAVE THE MONEY BUT

01:32:31.178 --> 01:32:33.681

BENCHMARK. YOU CAN SEE FOR THE

01:33:31.839 --> 01:33:33.341
SIX YEARS WE'VE BEEN BELOW

01:33:33.407 --> 01:33:34.742
INCLUDING THE MOST RECENT YEAR

01:33:34.809 --> 01:33:35.543
WHERE WE DID HAVE THAT MORE

01:33:35.609 --> 01:33:37.945

WENT ABOUT. AS I SAID THIS IS

01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:43.084
NOT A CáC THERE CAN BE YEARS

01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:45.219
WHETHER WE GO ABOUT- AND I WILL

01:33:45.286 --> 01:33:46.754
NOTE. IN ONE OF IN THE YEARS

01:33:46.821 --> 01:33:48.522
THAT WE WENT ABOVE. I ONE OF

01:33:48.589 --> 01:33:50.958
THOSE YEARS- OUR STATE

01:33:51.025 --> 01:33:52.393
EXCHANGE- HAD SOME TOUGH OF.

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:54.028
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. AND SO

01:33:54.095 --> 01:33:55.730
WE DECIDED THAT AS A STATE WE

01:33:55.796 --> 01:33:56.731
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVEYONE

01:33:56.797 --> 01:33:58.366

MANY PEOPLE. A TRUE INNOVATION

01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:53.087
SO I THINK HERE IS THAT- YOU

01:34:53.154 --> 01:34:54.488
CAN BE ABOVE THE BENCHMARK BUT

01:34:54.555 --> 01:34:55.923
YOU MAY BE MAKING INVESTMENTS

01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:57.425
THAT. UP IN THE- ROOM WHERE YOU

01:34:57.491 --> 01:35:03.431
CAN BE BOTH OF THE BENCHMARK-

01:35:03.497 --> 01:35:07.401

01:35:07.468 --> 01:35:12.873
CONTEXT IN DOT. ALL RIGHT. HOW

THREE TRACK TO THE STATES

01:35:15.476 --> 01:35:17.678
WEARING THOUGH THE BILL DATA WE-

01:35:17.745 --> 01:35:18.946
KIND OF COMPARING STATES WHICH

01:35:19.013 --> 01:35:20.948
OTHERS FROM. UP TO TWO THOUSAND

01:35:21.015 --> 01:35:22.416
FOURTEEN WHICH IS QUITE OLD-

01:35:22.483 --> 01:35:26.320
BUT- FROM THAT LAST TRYING TO

01:35:26.387 --> 01:35:26.821
DAY THAT WE GOT FROM THE

01:35:26.887 --> 01:35:28.389
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. CHOOSE A

CALIFORNIA HAVE ATTEMPT. AND

01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:38.599

01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:44.138
OF OUR HEALTHCARE SPENDING

01:35:44.205 --> 01:35:45.539
SPENDING HAS OF COURSE OF TOTAL.

01:35:45.606 --> 01:35:48.742
AKAN AND THE- ORANGE LINE

01:35:48.809 --> 01:35:49.477
HERE'S MASSIVE. AND THE BLUE IS

01:35:49.543 --> 01:35:51.045
YOUR STATES. YOU CAN SEE THAT

01:35:51.112 --> 01:35:52.680
WE ARE SPENDING MUCH MORE OF

01:35:52.746 --> 01:35:54.515
OUR ECONOMY OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH

01:35:54.582 --> 01:35:56.550
R. G. R. GDP ON HEALTHCARE IN

01:35:56.617 --> 01:35:58.119
THE UNITED STATES FOR A VERY

01:35:58.185 --> 01:35:59.487
LONG TIME. BUT THAT RATE IS NOW

01:35:59.553 --> 01:36:01.088
STABILIZE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF

01:36:01.155 --> 01:36:02.389
YEARS AND WE'VE ACTUALLY-

01:36:02.456 --> 01:36:03.824
DOUBLE OF THE UNITED STATES

01:36:03.891 --> 01:36:05.359
WE'VE SEEN THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY

01:36:05.426 --> 01:36:07.962
CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY HERE- AND

01:36:08.028 --> 01:36:10.164
THIS IS- ABOUT PERHAPS MOST

01:36:10.231 --> 01:36:11.599
EASIEST WAY TO LOOK AT THIS.

01:36:11.665 --> 01:36:12.867
NOW THIS IS JUST EMPLOYER

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:14.335
SPONSORED CARE THIS IS JUST A

01:36:14.401 --> 01:36:16.504
COMMERCIAL MARKET. A YEAR OVER

BELOW. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT

01:36:22.376 --> 01:36:25.412
EVERY YEAR CENTS TWO THOUSAND

01:36:25.479 --> 01:36:26.580
TWELVE THAT WARNS LINE HAS BEEN

01:36:26.647 --> 01:36:29.116
BELOW THE BLUE LINE.

01:36:29.183 --> 01:36:33.254
MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST. EUROPE

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:34.255

01:36:34.321 --> 01:36:35.756
GENERATED. OF DOLLARS ABOUT

01:36:35.823 --> 01:36:36.724
WHAT OTHER HAVE BEEN IF WE

01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:38.325
GROWN AT THE U. S. RATE. THAT

01:36:38.392 --> 01:36:40.127
MEANS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR

01:36:40.194 --> 01:36:41.762
INDIVIDUALS THAT OTHERWISE

01:36:41.829 --> 01:36:42.863
WOULD HAVE BEEN IN INCREASE

01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:44.932
PREMIUMS. I AM MEANS WAGE

01:36:44.999 --> 01:36:46.534

01:36:49.537 --> 01:36:51.672
HEALTHCARE- IT'S HARD TO SAY

01:36:51.739 --> 01:36:54.008
EXACTLY WHAT- BUT FOR THIS

01:36:54.074 --> 01:36:54.975
EFFORT WHAT THAT TREND LINE

01:36:55.042 --> 01:36:57.578
WOULD HAVE BEEN. MAYBE WOULD

01:36:57.645 --> 01:36:58.312
HAVE BEEN IN EXCESS OF THE

01:36:58.379 --> 01:36:59.947
UNITED STATES AND CONTINUED

TREND. UP NONETHELESS THESE ARE

01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:03.450
GOOD DIRECTIONAL DATA THAT SAYS

01:37:03.517 --> 01:37:05.352

AFFECTING OUR RESIDENTS. AND

01:37:12.026 --> 01:37:14.461
WHERE IS THAT OCCURRED- AGAIN

01:37:14.528 --> 01:37:18.365
KIND OF DIVING BENEATH HERE

01:37:18.432 --> 01:37:20.868
IT'S REALLY. POSSIBLE REDUCE IN

01:37:20.935 --> 01:37:23.337
OUR GROWTH NOT BE AS HIGH AS AS

01:37:23.404 --> 01:37:25.139

CONCERNS. ABOUT WHAT THE

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:17.164
IMPACTS OF THAT COULD BE. SO WE

SPENDING HAS BEEN A MAJOR

01:42:40.287 --> 01:42:41.922
DRIVER OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

01:42:41.989 --> 01:42:44.591
YEARS- AND AS YOU SAID IT'S NOT

01:42:44.658 --> 01:42:47.160
JUST AT THE RETAIL- CLINIC- WE

HOSPITALS AND PLACE IS KIND OF

01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:52.332
THE MEDICAL PHARMACY SPEND

01:42:52.399 --> 01:42:55.736
THINGS LIKE ONCOLOGY DRUGS. AND

01:42:55.802 --> 01:42:57.204
INCREASING AND SO THAT THE

01:42:57.271 --> 01:42:58.906
DOCTORS HERE THAT WE'RETALKING

01:42:58.972 --> 01:43:01.441
ABOUT. SMALL ANYMORE I AM IN

OUR CAR BOND MARKET IT CAN BE

01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:04.678
UPWARDS OF BASICALLY ONE IN

01:43:04.745 --> 01:43:05.879
FOUR DOLLARS OF HEALTHCARE

01:43:05.946 --> 01:43:07.614
DOLLARS IS GOING A PHARMACY.

01:43:07.681 --> 01:43:09.750
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF

01:43:09.816 --> 01:43:11.084
THIS ENTIRE PIE THAT WE NEED TO

01:43:11.151 --> 01:43:12.886
ALSO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT AND

01:43:12.953 --> 01:43:13.620
MAKE SURE THAT WERE HOLDING

01:43:13.687 --> 01:43:16.023
ACCOUNTABLE AND IS PART OF THIS

01:43:16.089 --> 01:43:19.893
THIS OVERALL COLLECTIVE ACTION

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:21.528
WE HAVE BEEN- KIND OF.

01:43:21.595 --> 01:43:22.930
BEGINNING TO WORK IN THIS AREA

01:43:22.996 --> 01:43:24.731
AND SO ONE OF THAT ARE KIND OF

01:43:24.798 --> 01:43:26.400
INITIAL STEPS THAT ARE GOVERNOR

01:43:26.466 --> 01:43:27.801
PROPOSED ARE LEGISLATURE.

01:43:27.868 --> 01:43:30.237
ADOPTED LAST YEAR. WAS A

01:43:30.304 --> 01:43:33.941
PROCESS BY WHICH- WE NOW POLICY

01:43:34.007 --> 01:43:35.309
COMMISSION WORK WITH OUR STATE

01:43:35.375 --> 01:43:37.210
MEDICAID PROGRAM. ORDER TO TRY

01:43:37.277 --> 01:43:39.313
TO GET BETTER VALUE FOR THE FAR

01:43:39.379 --> 01:43:40.581
MEDICAID PROGRAM. I'M SO THE

01:43:40.647 --> 01:43:42.082
WAY THAT THIS WORKS REALLY

01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:44.017
QUICKLY IS THAT I'VE MEDICAID

01:43:44.084 --> 01:43:45.252
WHICH IS CALLED MASS HEALTH AND

01:43:45.319 --> 01:43:49.022
NOT USE ITS- NEGOTIATED

01:43:49.089 --> 01:43:51.191
MANUFACTURE. ON TRYING TO GET A

01:43:51.258 --> 01:43:53.794
SUPPLEMENTAL READING. AUG MANY

01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:54.828
HAVE TO PROVIDE UNDER FEDERAL

01:43:54.895 --> 01:43:56.730
RULES KIND OF A STANDARD REBATE

01:43:56.797 --> 01:43:58.098
BUT STATES CAN NEGOTIATE

01:43:58.165 --> 01:44:00.267
GREATER REBATES. AND SO

01:44:00.334 --> 01:44:02.669
AUTHORIZES OUR MEDICAID PROGRAM

01:44:02.736 --> 01:44:04.071
TO ENTER INTO THOSE TYPES

01:44:04.137 --> 01:44:05.238
NEGOTIATIONS. IF THOSE

01:44:05.305 --> 01:44:08.041
NEGOTIATIONS FAIL- AND THE DRUG

01:44:08.108 --> 01:44:10.243
IS OF A CERTAIN HIGH COST OR

01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:11.745
CERTAIN IMPACT OF THE BUDGET.

01:44:11.812 --> 01:44:13.413
THEN OUR OUR MASS OF PROGRAM

01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:15.582
CAN THEN IDENTIFY WHAT IT

01:44:15.649 --> 01:44:17.718
THINKS THE RIGHT VALUE OF THAT

01:44:17.784 --> 01:44:19.119
DRUG CAN BE CAN HOLD A PUBLIC

01:44:19.186 --> 01:44:23.256
HEARING. ON THAT DRUGS AND

01:44:23.323 --> 01:44:24.191
CONTINUE TO GO WITH THE

01:44:24.257 --> 01:44:26.026
MANUFACTURER ROUND POTENTIAL

01:44:26.093 --> 01:44:28.395
SUPPLEMENTAL BATES. IF ALL OF

01:44:28.462 --> 01:44:31.098
THOSE NEGOTIATIONS FAIL- THEN

01:44:31.164 --> 01:44:32.399
BASICALLY THE MEDICAID PROGRAM

01:44:32.466 --> 01:44:35.335
REFERS THAT ISSUE THAT DRUG

01:44:35.402 --> 01:44:37.571
THAT MANUFACTURE TO THE HEALTH

01:44:37.638 --> 01:44:38.972
POLICY COMMISSION WEAR THEM WE

01:44:39.039 --> 01:44:40.474
CONDUCT OUR OWN INDEPENDENT

01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:43.276
OBJECTIVE REVIEW OF THE VALUE

01:44:43.343 --> 01:44:45.245
AND PRICING OF THAT DRUG- AND

01:44:45.312 --> 01:44:47.781
SO WE RECEIVED NOTICE NOT SO

01:44:47.848 --> 01:44:49.216
DISSIMILAR FROM THE PROCESS

01:44:49.282 --> 01:44:50.884
THAT I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT

01:44:50.951 --> 01:44:52.653
WHEN I TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW

01:44:52.719 --> 01:44:54.254
MERGERS AND PROVIDER CHANGES WE

01:44:54.321 --> 01:44:55.922
RECEIVE A NOTICE AND THEN WE

01:44:55.989 --> 01:44:58.225
CAN GET SIGNIFICANT WE CAN GET

01:44:58.291 --> 01:45:00.160
OUR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

01:45:00.227 --> 01:45:02.262
FROM THE MANUFACTURER AROUND

01:45:02.329 --> 01:45:05.065
THEIR PRICING THEIR BATES-

01:45:05.132 --> 01:45:08.702
THEIR PRICES IN ARE ONLY.

01:45:08.769 --> 01:45:09.970
THEY'RE RE AND DEVELOPMENT. ALL

01:45:10.037 --> 01:45:12.005
OF WHICH THEN I FEEDS INTO OUR

01:45:12.072 --> 01:45:14.641
OWN OBJECTIVE REVIEW TO TRY TO

01:45:14.708 --> 01:45:16.109
UNDERSTAND IS THE PRICE OF THIS

01:45:16.176 --> 01:45:18.578
DRUG ON REASONABLE OR EXCESSIVE

01:45:18.645 --> 01:45:21.581
IN RELATION TO WHAT WE THINK

01:45:21.648 --> 01:45:22.716
THE TRUE VALUE OF THE DRUG IS.

01:45:22.783 --> 01:45:24.551
SO I'LL BE BASICALLY THAT AND

01:45:24.618 --> 01:45:27.220
SAY WE THINK THAT THIS DRUG IS

01:45:27.287 --> 01:45:29.756
POTENTIALLY ON REASONABLY ARE

01:45:29.823 --> 01:45:31.958
ACCEPT CHRIST- THAT TRIGGERS

01:45:32.025 --> 01:45:33.627
ANOTHER PUBLIC HEARING MORE

01:45:33.694 --> 01:45:35.162
OPPORTUNITY FOR INFORMATION

01:45:35.228 --> 01:45:36.663
SHARING BACK AND FORTH. AND

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:38.265
THEN FINALLY THE PROCESS AND

01:45:38.331 --> 01:45:39.866
WITH US BEING ABLE TO MAKE A

01:45:39.933 --> 01:45:41.802
FINAL DETERMINATION THAT A DRUG

01:45:41.868 --> 01:45:43.470
IS EXCESSIVELY ARE REASONABLY

01:45:43.537 --> 01:45:46.106
PRICED. I'M THIS IS OUR AREA

01:45:46.173 --> 01:45:47.140
FOR THE HOUSEHOLD THE

01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:50.610
COMMISSION. BUT WE THINK IT IS

01:45:50.677 --> 01:45:51.378
VERY CONSISTENT. WITH OUR OTHER

01:45:51.445 --> 01:45:53.613
MARK. FACTORS WERE REALLY.

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:56.450
BRING MORE ACCOUNTABILITY AND

01:45:56.516 --> 01:45:58.752
TRANSPARENCY TO DO THIS THE END

01:45:58.819 --> 01:46:01.354
IS. AND FIND YOUR- THE

01:46:01.421 --> 01:46:02.756
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRICING

01:46:02.823 --> 01:46:06.026
AND VALUE. WE WANT TO THE RIGHT

01:46:06.093 --> 01:46:07.394
YOU KNOW. AB THAT THE PRICE IS

01:46:07.461 --> 01:46:10.397
WHAT THE MANUFACTURER HAS

01:46:10.464 --> 01:46:12.799
PROPOSED- IN RELATION TO THAT

01:46:12.866 --> 01:46:14.568
OUT. BY MADE YOU AT THAT PRICE

01:46:14.634 --> 01:46:16.436
IS DOUBLE THE APPLE VALLEY THAT

01:46:16.503 --> 01:46:18.238
PROVIDED DROUGHT WE KNOW THAT

01:46:18.305 --> 01:46:20.907
AND UNDER THAT BE TRAINED.

01:46:20.974 --> 01:46:24.878
ABOUT THAT. IN ORDER TO TOUR

01:46:24.945 --> 01:46:32.285
THAT. THAT WERE. SOME ARE. WHY

01:46:32.352 --> 01:46:33.286
SHOULD STATE FOLKS ON

01:46:33.353 --> 01:46:34.187
HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR THE BILL I

01:46:34.254 --> 01:46:35.756
THINK I WILL JUST AND REPEATING

01:46:35.822 --> 01:46:36.923
MANY OF THINGS THAT HAVE

01:46:36.990 --> 01:46:39.426
ALREADY BEEN SAID HERE TODAY-

01:46:39.493 --> 01:46:41.394
FIVE AND THIS IS A TREND THAT

01:46:41.461 --> 01:46:42.829
WAS I THINK THE VERY SIMILAR

01:46:42.896 --> 01:46:44.030
SLIDE THAT WHERE YOU SHOWED

01:46:44.097 --> 01:46:45.165
EARLIER TODAY THIS IS

01:46:45.232 --> 01:46:46.566
MASSACHUSETTS DATA I HAVE TO

01:46:46.633 --> 01:46:48.435
IMAGINE IF YOU READ HELP ME DAY

01:46:48.502 --> 01:46:49.669
YOU WOULD FIND A VERY SIMILAR

01:46:49.736 --> 01:46:52.272
STORY. EMPLOYEES PREMIUMS ARE

01:46:52.339 --> 01:46:55.342
GOING UP EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS

01:46:55.408 --> 01:46:57.477
TO THOSE PREMIUMS ARE GOING UP.

01:46:57.544 --> 01:46:58.979
CO PAYMENTS AND DEDUCTIBLES ARE

01:46:59.045 --> 01:47:01.815
GOING OUT AT RAPID RAPID RATES

01:47:01.882 --> 01:47:04.251
AND WAGE GROWTH AND INFLATION

01:47:04.317 --> 01:47:06.453
ARE NOT AND SO WHAT THIS MEANS

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:08.455
IS JUST LAST AND LAST DOLLARS

01:47:08.522 --> 01:47:09.823
IN THE HANDS OF OUR FAMILIES

01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:11.491
AND INDIVIDUALS TO BE ABLE FOR

01:47:11.558 --> 01:47:13.226
HELP. AND EVEN IN A VERY HIGH

01:47:13.293 --> 01:47:14.628
INCOME STATE LIKE MASSACHUSETTS

01:47:14.694 --> 01:47:16.129
AND EVEN WITH OUR RECENT

01:47:16.196 --> 01:47:18.431
PROGRESS- WE HAVE WANTED FOR

01:47:18.498 --> 01:47:19.533
MASSACHUSETTS RESIDENTS TO

01:47:19.599 --> 01:47:20.901
REPORT THAT THEY DEFERRED

01:47:20.967 --> 01:47:22.502
NECESSARYHEALTH CARE BECAUSE

01:47:22.569 --> 01:47:24.037
THEY COULDN'T AFFORD THE COST.

01:47:24.104 --> 01:47:26.006
WE HAVE ONE IN FIVE

01:47:26.072 --> 01:47:26.573
MASSACHUSETTS RESIDENTS WHO

01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:28.341
SAID THEY CAN GET UP TO FILL

01:47:28.408 --> 01:47:29.976
BECAUSE THEY CAN AFFORD THE

01:47:30.043 --> 01:47:32.679
COST. I'M CASES WHENCE TELLS OR

01:47:32.746 --> 01:47:35.015
RATION THEIR PILLS OR SHARE

01:47:35.081 --> 01:47:35.649
THEIR PILLS WITH ANOTHER FAMILY

01:47:35.715 --> 01:47:37.651
MEMBER. CONTRIBUTING TO

01:47:37.717 --> 01:47:41.521
WORSENING HEALTH. THIS IS THIS

01:47:41.588 --> 01:47:43.256
IS SOMETHING THAT- ULTIMATELY

01:47:43.323 --> 01:47:46.259
IMPACTS EVERYONE IN THE STATE

01:47:46.326 --> 01:47:48.628
AND IT ALSO IMPACTS PEOPLE IN

01:47:48.695 --> 01:47:49.729
IT IN NOT NECESSARILY EQUAL

01:47:49.796 --> 01:47:52.032
WEIGHTS WE SEE THAT THIS IS

01:47:52.098 --> 01:47:53.934
MOST IMPACTING OUR LOWER AND

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.636
MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES- THERE'S

01:47:56.703 --> 01:47:58.305
ONE BEARING THE BRUNT OF THIS

01:47:58.371 --> 01:48:00.941
AND SO- YOU. THE RECENT

01:48:01.007 --> 01:48:03.343
PROGRESS WE'VE MADE I WE LOOKED

01:48:03.410 --> 01:48:04.110
AT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF WAGE

01:48:04.177 --> 01:48:05.745
INCREASES BETWEEN TWENTY

01:48:05.812 --> 01:48:07.147
SIXTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND

01:48:07.214 --> 01:48:08.148
WHERE DID ALL THAT MONEY WHERE

01:48:08.215 --> 01:48:10.083
DID THAT WAGE INCREASE CO. MORE

01:48:10.150 --> 01:48:11.985
OF THAT WAGE INCREASE WENT INTO

01:48:12.052 --> 01:48:14.087
HEALTHCARE AND WENT INTO

01:48:14.154 --> 01:48:17.123
PEOPLE'S POCKETS. AND YOU KNOW

01:48:17.190 --> 01:48:18.558
I COULD SAY MAYBE THE STORY

01:48:18.625 --> 01:48:20.527
WOULD BE MUCH WORSE BUT FOR OUR

01:48:20.594 --> 01:48:22.896
EFFORTS I DO BELIEVE THAT. THIS

01:48:22.963 --> 01:48:24.297
STORY WOULD BE WORST BY FAR

01:48:24.364 --> 01:48:25.799
EFFORTS IN RECENT YEARS TO TRY

01:48:25.866 --> 01:48:26.833
TO CONTROL HEALTHCARE COST

01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:28.835
GROWTH. BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY

01:48:28.902 --> 01:48:29.603
THAT AND I'M NOT HERE TO SAY

01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:31.104
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED I'M

01:48:31.171 --> 01:48:32.806
BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS AN

01:48:32.873 --> 01:48:33.874
URGENT AND GENERATIONAL

01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:36.676
CHALLENGE IF WE CAN SWIM DOWN

01:48:36.743 --> 01:48:38.645
TO A REASONABLE DEGREE OVER

01:48:38.712 --> 01:48:41.314
TIME. THE WORST PART OF THIS

01:48:41.381 --> 01:48:43.316
DOLLAR THAT MEANS MORE IN THE

01:48:43.383 --> 01:48:44.784
BLUE PART OF THIS DOLLAR AND

01:48:44.851 --> 01:48:46.119
THAT MEANS A STRONGER AND

01:48:46.186 --> 01:48:49.589
HEALTHIER- SOCIETY BEFORE. AND

01:48:49.656 --> 01:48:50.724
THERE IS TO DO THIS AND TO DO

01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:52.225
IT ONCE AND TO DO IT STILL

01:55:11.371 --> 01:55:13.206
ACTUALLY BEEN GROWING AT A RATE

01:55:13.273 --> 01:55:19.479
OF CLOSER DOT SIX. CHANNEL

01:55:19.545 --> 01:55:21.314
REALLY JOHN ON FOR. AND ON END

01:55:21.381 --> 01:55:22.415
OF. AND A- IN THE STATE AND

01:55:22.482 --> 01:55:24.617
THIS IS ORGAN DAY LIKE DAVID

01:55:24.684 --> 01:55:25.985
SAID I WOULD SUSPECT THAT IF

01:55:26.052 --> 01:55:26.586
YOU RAN SOMETHING SIMILAR YOU

01:55:26.653 --> 01:55:28.121
PROBABLY SEE SIMILAR TRENDS IN

01:55:28.187 --> 01:55:29.589
CALIFORNIA- THIS IS ALL

01:55:29.656 --> 01:55:31.157
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA AND-

01:55:31.224 --> 01:55:32.492
HAPPY TO SHARE HOW WE DID THIS-

01:55:32.558 --> 01:55:34.661
IF IT'S HELPFUL BUT- THE TAKE

01:55:34.727 --> 01:55:36.062
AWAY HERE THIS COMPARES-

01:55:36.129 --> 01:55:39.232
INCOME- GROWTH FROM TWO

01:55:39.299 --> 01:55:39.799
THOUSAND TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN

01:55:39.866 --> 01:55:40.600
COMPARED TO. PREMIUM GROWTH AND

01:55:40.667 --> 01:55:41.467
THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO GET

01:55:41.534 --> 01:55:43.002
COVERAGE THROUGH THEIR EMPLOYER

01:55:43.069 --> 01:55:44.070
SO THIS IS JUST. PRIVATE

01:55:44.137 --> 01:55:46.306
MARKETS- PREMIUMS WERE THREE

01:55:46.372 --> 01:55:48.608
TIMES FASTER THAN WAGES-

01:55:48.675 --> 01:55:50.576
WORKERS CONTRIBUTIONS GROUP

01:55:50.643 --> 01:55:52.445
FOUR TIMES FASTER THAN WAGES

01:55:52.512 --> 01:55:53.546
AND DEDUCTIBLES GREW TO FASTER

01:55:53.613 --> 01:55:55.782
SO. WHAT THIS REALLY A QUITE

01:55:55.848 --> 01:55:57.050
STEW IS A DOUBLE WHAMMY FOR

01:55:57.116 --> 01:55:58.618
FAMILIES IN THE STATE. I'M AS

01:55:58.685 --> 01:56:01.054
PREMIUMS ARE. GROWING AGAIN.

01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:04.390
THERE'S FEWER DOLLARS FOR

01:56:04.457 --> 01:56:04.991
EMPLOYERS TO PUT TOWARDS WAGES

01:56:05.058 --> 01:56:06.626
AND IT. AND THESE ARE. OUR

01:56:06.693 --> 01:56:07.593
YOU'RE SURE AT OF THEIR OWN

01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:09.629
POCKET. THOSE COSTS KIND OF WAR

01:56:09.696 --> 01:56:12.899
THE- AND IN A MORE YEARS FROM

01:56:12.965 --> 01:56:13.866
TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN.

01:56:13.933 --> 01:56:17.737
INCOME GREW FIFTEEN PERCENT SO

01:56:17.804 --> 01:56:18.304
I AM NOT SURE WHY IT. HASN'T

01:56:18.371 --> 01:56:19.972
SHOWN A THE- HOUSEHOLD INCOME

01:56:20.039 --> 01:56:21.908
GROWTH. PERCENT IN ORDER.

01:56:21.974 --> 01:56:23.910
DEDUCTIBLES FOR SEVENTY SEVEN

01:56:23.976 --> 01:56:26.746
PERCENT. AND THE AVERAGE FAMILY

01:56:26.813 --> 01:56:30.116
PREMIUM EQUAL 29% OF AVERAGE

01:56:30.183 --> 01:56:30.650
HOUSEHOLD INCOME SO. FROM

01:56:30.717 --> 01:56:32.485
AMOUNT UP. SORT OF COMPENSATION

01:56:32.552 --> 01:56:35.088
BENEFITS- TRAPPED IN HEALTH

01:56:35.154 --> 01:56:36.489
CARE THAT AREN'T GOING TO

01:56:36.556 --> 01:56:44.030
WAGES. GOING COULD. AND WHAT I

01:56:44.097 --> 01:56:48.868
HEAR FROM. FROM STATE. RUNNING

01:56:48.935 --> 01:56:51.170
WITH A WE LOSS PEOPLE BEFORE

01:56:51.237 --> 01:56:52.138
HOUSING ALLOWS FOR RETIRED THE

01:56:52.205 --> 01:56:53.773
LAW FOR A THINGS OF THINGS THAT

01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:55.508
ARE ALSO UNFORTUNATELY THE PICK

01:56:55.575 --> 01:56:56.142
ISN'T ALL THAT ROSE LOOKING FOR

01:56:56.209 --> 01:56:58.144
OR FORWARD HEALTH IS X. TO GO

01:56:58.211 --> 01:56:59.846
FROM ABOUT SEVENTEEN AND A HALF

01:56:59.912 --> 01:57:00.713
PERCENT OF GROSS DOMESTIC

01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:02.715
PRODUCT NATIONALLY TODAY TO

01:57:02.782 --> 01:57:05.284
ABOUT NINETEEN AND A HALF BY

01:57:05.351 --> 01:57:06.052
TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN AND THAT'S-

01:57:06.119 --> 01:57:07.387
BASED ON THE AMOUNT IS

01:57:07.453 --> 01:57:09.255
PROJECTIONS THAT ON AVERAGE

01:57:09.322 --> 01:57:10.056
HEALTHCARE COSTS WILL GROW FOUR

01:57:10.123 --> 01:57:11.924
POINT SEVEN PERCENT. PER CENT

01:57:11.991 --> 01:57:14.160
PER YEAR THAT MAY NOT SOUND

01:57:14.227 --> 01:57:15.495
ENORMOUS IT'S ALL IT'S A LOT

01:57:15.561 --> 01:57:17.497
BUT IT IT'S THE KEY HERE IS

01:57:17.563 --> 01:57:18.865
THAT IT'S GROWING IT'S FASTER

01:57:18.931 --> 01:57:20.099
THAN ALL THE OTHER ECONOMIC

01:57:20.166 --> 01:57:20.933
INDICATORS IT'S THROUGH AND

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.436
WAGES FASTER THAN THE ECONOMY

01:57:23.503 --> 01:57:26.472
AND SO THAT THAT'S THE PROBLEM

01:57:26.539 --> 01:57:27.573
IS KEEP THE DELTA BETWEEN TO

01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:31.577
JUST GETTING BIGGER HERE. THE

01:57:31.644 --> 01:57:33.146
CMS BREAKS ONE SORT OF WHAT

01:57:33.212 --> 01:57:33.946
THOSE COSTS DRIVERS ARE IF YOU

01:57:34.013 --> 01:57:34.547
ABOUT WHAT TOTAL SPENDING IN

01:57:34.614 --> 01:57:37.049
THE STATE YOU CAN KIND OF BREAK

01:57:37.116 --> 01:57:37.650
IT INTO TWO THINGS THAT'S THE

01:57:37.717 --> 01:57:38.985
PRICE OF SERVICES THAT YOU PAY

01:57:39.051 --> 01:57:40.653
AND IT'S THAT. THE UTILIZATION

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:42.288
THE NUMBER OF SERVICES THAT GET

01:57:42.355 --> 01:57:43.956
PROVIDED YOU COMBINE THOSE TWO

01:57:44.023 --> 01:57:45.458
YOU HAVE TOTAL SPENDING. YOU

01:57:45.525 --> 01:57:47.593
CAN ALSO PICK APART- SORT OF

01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:49.128
THE DEMOGRAPHICS SO HOW MUCH-

01:57:49.195 --> 01:57:50.663
IS THE RESULT OF AN AGING

01:57:50.730 --> 01:57:51.831
POPULATION AND THAT'S WHAT THIS

01:57:51.898 --> 01:57:53.499
PIE CHART THAT SO- I THINK A

01:57:53.566 --> 01:57:55.668
LOT OF FOLKS- YOU KNOW OFTEN

01:57:55.735 --> 01:57:56.502
SAY WELL WE'VE GOT AGING

01:57:56.569 --> 01:57:58.337
POPULATION AND SO THAT'S WHAT'S

01:57:58.404 --> 01:57:59.138
DRIVING HEALTHCARE COSTS THAT'S

01:57:59.205 --> 01:57:59.872
ACTUALLY ONLY SEVENTEEN

01:57:59.939 --> 01:58:02.809
PERCENT. THE BASE COST DRIVER

01:58:02.875 --> 01:58:04.811
IS PRICE INCREASES YOUR OVER

01:58:04.877 --> 01:58:06.813
YOUR FIRST FOR SERVICES- ORGAN

01:58:06.879 --> 01:58:08.214
IN CALIFORNIA HAVE HAD SOME

01:58:08.281 --> 01:58:10.049
RECENT TRENDS IN THE SPACE THIS

01:58:10.116 --> 01:58:12.351
SHOWS- THE DIFFERENCE. BETWEEN

01:58:12.418 --> 01:58:14.921
PRICE AND YOUR POSITION FOR- IT

01:58:14.987 --> 01:58:18.591
INPATIENT OUTPATIENT SERVICES

01:58:18.658 --> 01:58:20.626
TOP LINES ARE INCREASE. PRICES

01:58:20.693 --> 01:58:26.866
AND. IS MISSION WE'RE JUST HERE

01:58:26.933 --> 01:58:29.569
N. N. O. THE TAKE AWAY HERE

01:58:29.635 --> 01:58:30.303
THAT WE ACTUALLY BOTH STATES

01:58:30.369 --> 01:58:31.003
HAVE BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB OF

01:58:31.070 --> 01:58:32.472
THE YOUR- ASSUMING THAT WAS

01:58:32.538 --> 01:58:33.773
GOOD DECREASES IN UTILIZATION

01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:35.341
BUT FOR THAT PRICE HAVE BEEN

01:58:35.408 --> 01:58:36.375
MORE THAN UP FOR THAT AND SO

01:58:36.442 --> 01:58:38.611
THAT'S A- A BIG. A BIG

01:58:38.678 --> 01:58:40.079
CHALLENGE THAT WE BOTH HAVE.

01:58:40.146 --> 01:58:42.515
EDITION ONLY PRICES VERY VERY

01:58:42.582 --> 01:58:44.650
DRAMATICALLY- THIS ALSO COMES

01:58:44.717 --> 01:58:45.618
FROM OUR ALL PAYER CLAIMS

01:58:45.685 --> 01:58:46.953
DATABASE WE'VE BEEN DOING IT

01:58:47.019 --> 01:58:48.988
MORE MORE WITH THAT DATABASE-

01:58:49.055 --> 01:58:50.323
AND THIS COST GROWTH TARGET

01:58:50.389 --> 01:58:51.390
PROGRAM WILL REALLY TAKE THAT

01:58:51.457 --> 01:58:52.992
TO THE NEXT LEVEL BUT- ONE OF

01:58:53.059 --> 01:58:53.860
THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN DOING IS

01:58:53.926 --> 01:58:55.461
PUTTING OUT AN ANNUAL REPORT

01:58:55.528 --> 01:58:57.230
ON. VARIATION AND TYPICAL

01:58:57.296 --> 01:59:00.566
PRICES- BY A HOSPITAL FACILITY

01:59:00.633 --> 01:59:01.634
IN THE STATE AND SO JUST TO

01:59:01.701 --> 01:59:02.935
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF. WHAT

01:59:03.002 --> 01:59:05.104
THAT VARIATIONLOOKS LIKE- A

01:59:05.171 --> 01:59:06.472
NORMAL DELIVERY AGAIN THIS IS

01:59:06.539 --> 01:59:07.473
JUST COME FROM MARKET NOT

01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:10.510
MEDICAID OR MEDICARE ONCE IN A

01:59:10.576 --> 01:59:12.578
MEDICARE BUT NOT MEDICAID- THE-

01:59:12.645 --> 01:59:14.180
THE RANGE OF. ALL DELIVERY

01:59:14.247 --> 01:59:17.416
RANGES FROM THOUSAND DOLLARS TO

01:59:17.483 --> 01:59:18.017
TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THESE

01:59:18.084 --> 01:59:20.987
ARE ACTUAL. PAID IN TWENTY

01:59:21.053 --> 01:59:24.023
SIXTEEN SO. IN ORDER AGAIN PAGE.

01:59:24.090 --> 01:59:25.157
I DO OF FOUR TIMES THE AMOUNT

01:59:25.224 --> 01:59:26.492
BASED OFF OF WHAT HOSPITAL

01:59:26.559 --> 01:59:27.627
FACILITY THEY HAPPEN TO WALK

01:59:27.693 --> 01:59:29.295
THROUGH. AND THIS IS A REAL

01:59:29.362 --> 01:59:30.463
THIS IS A REAL CHALLENGE WHEN

01:59:30.530 --> 01:59:33.432
DEDUCTIBLES ARE NOW GROWING TO

01:59:33.499 --> 01:59:33.966
THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN

01:59:34.033 --> 01:59:36.035
THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO WHAT'S THE

01:59:36.102 --> 01:59:37.336
SOLUTION AT LEAST THE SOLUTION

01:59:37.403 --> 01:59:39.338
IN OREGON THAT WERE WHAT THE

01:59:39.405 --> 01:59:41.641
WORD MARCHING TOWARDS- LET'S

01:59:41.707 --> 01:59:42.775
THE SIMILAR TO MET TO

01:59:42.842 --> 01:59:43.843
MASSACHUSETTS IT'S TO SET THE

01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:45.978
STATE WIDE. CARE COST GROWTH

01:59:46.045 --> 01:59:47.079
TARGET MUCH LIKE GLENN SAID AT

01:59:47.146 --> 01:59:49.148
THE HIS OPENING REMARKS- I

01:59:49.215 --> 01:59:49.815
THINK OF THIS IS SORT OF

01:59:49.882 --> 01:59:51.183
STUDYING AND BUDGET TARGET FOR

01:59:51.250 --> 01:59:53.219
TOTAL HEALTHCARE SPENDING- IN

01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:55.621
THE STATE. WE DON'T WE DON'T

01:59:55.688 --> 01:59:57.256
TYPICALLY AND STATES HAVE NOT

01:59:57.323 --> 01:59:58.291
LOOKED AT WHAT THE TOTAL

01:59:58.357 --> 02:00:00.259
HEALTHCARE SPENDING AS WE OFTEN

02:00:00.326 --> 02:00:01.327
LOOK AT WHAT IT IS FOR MEDICAID

02:00:01.394 --> 02:00:02.895
OR WHAT IS REPUBLICAN.

02:00:02.962 --> 02:00:04.430
EMPLOYEES BUT WE LOOK AT THOSE

02:00:04.497 --> 02:00:05.765
ALL ESTA SILOS AND THIS IS

02:00:05.831 --> 02:00:07.600
REALLY. I THINK ABOUT SETTING A

02:00:07.667 --> 02:00:08.868
BUDGET TARGET- AND THEN

02:00:08.935 --> 02:00:09.936
STARTING HOLD OURSELVES

02:00:10.002 --> 02:00:10.870
ACCOUNTABLE TO SAY HOW DO WE

02:00:10.937 --> 02:00:12.772
LIVE WITHIN THAT BUDGET TARGET-

02:00:12.838 --> 02:00:15.641
I AM MUCH LIKE MY- HI. I'M

02:00:15.708 --> 02:00:18.177
HOUSEHOLD- MUCH LIKE MY- TEAM

02:00:18.244 --> 02:00:19.145
WITH AN ORGAN HEALTH AUTHORITY

02:00:19.211 --> 02:00:20.479
I HAVE A BUDGET I GOT A MANAGE

02:00:20.546 --> 02:00:23.382
TO- SO I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO

02:00:23.449 --> 02:00:24.283
DO THAT IF I FOR STUDENTS AT A

02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:24.917
BUDGET AND THEN STARTED A

02:00:24.984 --> 02:00:26.419
MEASURE MY SPENDING TO FIGURE

02:00:26.485 --> 02:00:27.720
OUT WHETHER I MEDIAN OR NOT.

02:00:27.787 --> 02:00:29.121
AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THAT

02:00:29.188 --> 02:00:30.423
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM SORT OF LET

02:00:30.489 --> 02:00:33.492
LET- FRANKLY ACTUARIES OFTEN TO

02:00:33.559 --> 02:00:35.328
THOSE WITH THE HEALTHCARE COSTS

02:00:35.394 --> 02:00:40.466
GOING TO GROW. WHAT WE ALL. BY

02:00:40.533 --> 02:00:41.767
OF MY TIME ABOUT PRICE BEING A

02:00:41.834 --> 02:00:43.035
BIG DRIVER AND JAMIE NOW. STOCK

02:00:43.102 --> 02:00:44.537
OF THAT IS YOU'LL NOTE THAT WE

02:00:44.604 --> 02:00:45.438
ARE TAKE WE ARE GOING TO ACOSTA

02:00:45.504 --> 02:00:46.672
CARE APPROACH AND WE'VE STE.

02:00:46.739 --> 02:00:48.174
THE WAY WE LANDED ON HIS

02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:49.609
PROGRAM WAS WE HAD A TASK FORCE

02:00:49.675 --> 02:00:51.677
AND- TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT WAS

02:00:51.744 --> 02:00:53.579
CHARGED WITH LOOKING AT. SHE WE

02:00:53.646 --> 02:00:54.814
CREATE A MARYLAND STYLE

02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:56.482
HOSPITAL RATE SETTING. UP

02:00:56.549 --> 02:00:58.417
PROGRAM MARYLAND- SETS HOSPITAL

02:00:58.484 --> 02:01:00.286
RATES FOR ALL MARKETS. NOT

02:01:00.353 --> 02:01:02.822
STATEWIDE- WE LOOKED AT THAT

02:01:02.888 --> 02:01:03.689
AND ULTIMATELY DECIDED THAT

02:01:03.756 --> 02:01:04.924
WASN'T THE RIGHT COURSE FOR

02:01:04.991 --> 02:01:07.793
ORGAN FOR A COUPLE REASONS. ONE

02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:08.661
MARYLAND HAS A WAIVER THAT

02:01:08.728 --> 02:01:09.528
NOBODY ELSE THINKS THERE SHOULD

02:01:09.595 --> 02:01:10.896
BE ABLE TO GET. BUT MORE

02:01:10.963 --> 02:01:13.766
IMPORTANTLY- EVEN THOUGH-

02:01:13.833 --> 02:01:14.834
PRICES ARE CHALLENGE EVEN THE

02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:16.869
HOSPITAL HOSPITAL PRICES IN.

02:01:16.936 --> 02:01:18.270
RECENT YEARS HAVE REALLY BEEN A

02:01:18.337 --> 02:01:19.372
CHALLENGE. THERE WAS A BIG

02:01:19.438 --> 02:01:24.543
CONCERN THAT IF WE FOCUS ONLY

02:01:24.610 --> 02:01:25.945
ONE PART OF THE SYSTEM. WE

02:01:26.012 --> 02:01:28.614
MIGHT. OF THE DAY. WE'RE GONNA.

02:01:28.681 --> 02:01:29.548
FROM NOW TRYING TO CHASE SOME

02:01:29.615 --> 02:01:30.349
OTHER PROBLEM. WELL MEANWHILE

02:01:30.416 --> 02:01:31.484
COSTS CONTINUES TO GROW AT

02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:32.585
THREE OR FOUR FIVE OR SIX

02:01:32.652 --> 02:01:34.420
PERCENT- SO THE GROUP GROUP

02:01:34.487 --> 02:01:36.956
DECIDED TO- LOOKED AT WHAT WHAT

02:01:37.023 --> 02:01:37.990
WHAT MASSACHUSETTS A DONE AND

02:01:38.057 --> 02:01:39.692
DECIDED TO CREATE THIS-

02:01:39.759 --> 02:01:42.061
SPENDING TARGET THAT APPLY- TO

02:01:42.128 --> 02:01:43.829
TOTAL PER CAPITA SPENDING-

02:01:43.896 --> 02:01:45.698
INCREASES YEAR OVER YEAR AND

02:01:45.765 --> 02:01:47.099
WILL APPLY. ALL PAIRS AND ALL

02:01:47.166 --> 02:01:48.300
PROVIDERS IN ALL MARKETS IN THE

02:01:48.367 --> 02:01:50.136
STATE. GET THE WRONG IDEA HERE

02:01:50.202 --> 02:01:52.271
IS THAT WE CAN BUILD MORE ON

02:01:52.338 --> 02:01:54.206
THIS ONCE YOU HAVE THE DATA

02:01:54.273 --> 02:01:54.807
ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT

02:01:54.874 --> 02:01:56.509
THE COST DRIVERS. THAT THEIR

02:01:56.575 --> 02:01:57.910
POLICY THINGS THAT MAYBE

02:01:57.977 --> 02:01:59.412
EVENTUALLY COMPLEMENT THIS. BUT

02:01:59.478 --> 02:02:00.880
IF WE DON'T START TO UNDERSTAND

02:02:00.946 --> 02:02:02.448
WHAT TOTAL SPENDING IS. AND

02:02:02.515 --> 02:02:03.315
START TO HAVE A COMMON

02:02:03.382 --> 02:02:05.117
UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE THE COST

02:02:05.184 --> 02:02:07.720
DRIVERS. THEN WE'RE JUST SORT

02:02:07.787 --> 02:02:11.590
OF. AT THE- SINCE I HERE AT THE

02:02:11.657 --> 02:02:15.761
CREE UP. REALLY COMMON. OR

02:02:15.828 --> 02:02:25.137
UNDER ANY PROBLEM ARE. SORT OF

02:02:25.204 --> 02:02:26.906
IMBALANCE AND THE MORE IS JAMIE

02:02:26.972 --> 02:02:27.773
MENTIONED EARLIER THERE'S BEEN

02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:29.675
HUGE CONSOLIDATION. NORMAL

02:02:29.742 --> 02:02:31.177
MARKET NEGOTIATIONS MARKET

02:02:31.243 --> 02:02:32.812
DYNAMICS ARE HOLDING COSTS DOWN

02:02:32.878 --> 02:02:34.046
THEY ARE HOLDING PRICES IN

02:02:34.113 --> 02:02:36.248
CHECK. AND THE SYSTEM FRANKLY

02:02:36.315 --> 02:02:38.117
IS FOCUSED ON REVENUE- IT'S

02:02:38.184 --> 02:02:39.885
SHOOING FOR. INCREASES IN

02:02:39.952 --> 02:02:42.021
REVENUE OR TRYING TO ITS

02:02:42.088 --> 02:02:42.621
REVENUE TARGET AND NOT TO SAY

02:02:42.688 --> 02:02:44.657
THAT THERE ARE. LEGITIMATE CASA

02:02:44.724 --> 02:02:46.592
UNDERNEATH THAT. BUT WHAT WE'RE

02:02:46.659 --> 02:02:47.693
FINALLY TRYING TO DO WITH THIS

02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:49.762
TARGET IS TO CHANGE THE DOSES.

02:02:49.829 --> 02:02:51.931
IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. LET'S

02:02:51.997 --> 02:02:54.233
TOWARDS. ENTERS COLLECT WHAT.

02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:55.634
MEETING A BUDGET THAT WE CAN

02:02:55.701 --> 02:02:57.336
AFFORD AS A STATE AND WORK BACK

02:02:57.403 --> 02:02:58.370
FROM THERE AND FIGURE OUT HOW

02:02:58.437 --> 02:03:00.106
DO WE HOW DO WE DO THAT AND HOW

02:03:00.172 --> 02:03:02.475
DO WE IMPROVE. VALUE IN IT AS

02:03:02.541 --> 02:03:03.776
PART OF THAT OVERALL EQUATION.

02:03:03.843 --> 02:03:05.277
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF.

02:03:05.344 --> 02:03:06.746
KIND OF THE SQUEEZING THE

02:03:06.812 --> 02:03:08.147
BALLOON CHALLENGE THAT WE THAT

02:03:08.214 --> 02:03:09.315
WE HAVE AND WHY WE THINK THIS

02:03:09.381 --> 02:03:10.783
TOTAL SPEND APPROACHES. IS

02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:12.952
RIGHT FOR AGAIN- THIS SHOWS

02:03:13.018 --> 02:03:14.987
CHANGES IN UTILIZATION A PRICE

02:03:15.054 --> 02:03:15.988
FOR EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS

02:03:16.055 --> 02:03:18.758
NATIONALLY SO. TO STILL LOOK TO

02:03:18.824 --> 02:03:20.292
THE CHART ON THE LEFT- BLEW IS

02:03:20.359 --> 02:03:21.927
A UTILIZATION GREEN A SPRITE IS

02:03:21.994 --> 02:03:23.763
THERE IS A LOT OF EMPHASIS.

02:03:23.829 --> 02:03:25.798
EIGHT EIGHT YEARS OR SO ON

02:03:25.865 --> 02:03:27.767
GETTING. EMERGE ROOM IT'S THE

02:03:27.833 --> 02:03:30.169
MOST. PLACE WHERE PEOPLE GO

02:03:30.236 --> 02:03:30.936
WHEN OFTEN THE SYSTEM BREAKS

02:03:31.003 --> 02:03:33.339
DOWN AND IN GET. SERVICE AND A

02:03:33.405 --> 02:03:35.341
BETTER BETTER PLACE WITHIN THE-

02:03:35.407 --> 02:03:36.942
SO WE GOT LUCKY ONE OF

02:03:37.009 --> 02:03:38.277
EMERGENCY ROOM IT THEN WE'RE

02:03:38.344 --> 02:03:39.645
WE'RE GONNA NATIONALLY AND THEN

02:03:39.712 --> 02:03:42.548
WE'LL HAVE. PRICE RUMORED ROOMS.

02:03:42.615 --> 02:03:48.387
COULD THE SYSTEM. AND GENTLY IN

02:03:48.454 --> 02:03:51.557
OUR ERR MODEL THE KNOW IT. ALSO

02:03:51.624 --> 02:03:52.758
ISN'T LOOK AT TRYING TO OUT HOW

02:03:52.825 --> 02:03:54.393
TO HOW TO KEEP THIS OVER SPEND

02:03:54.460 --> 02:03:59.932
WITH AND- A- ASK A SORT COST.

02:03:59.999 --> 02:04:03.335
COST TARGET. SO WE'LL FOCUS ON

02:04:03.402 --> 02:04:03.936
CAN'T WORRY PUSH UP. WERE RE

02:04:04.003 --> 02:04:06.005
PUSH. A HOW DO WE- THE REVENUE

02:04:06.071 --> 02:04:07.306
TARA THEY WERE SHE FOR AND FOR.

02:04:07.373 --> 02:04:09.308
THIS SCREEN SHOT ON THE IS FROM

02:04:09.375 --> 02:04:10.976
LOCAL PORTLAND AREA HOSPITAL I

02:04:11.043 --> 02:04:13.012
TOOK IT FROM- WEBSITE. THE AD

02:04:13.078 --> 02:04:14.547
THAT RAN ON THE ON THE SIDE-

02:04:14.613 --> 02:04:16.148
ADVERTISING FOR THEIR SHORT

02:04:16.215 --> 02:04:17.183
EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND

02:04:17.249 --> 02:04:17.883
TRYING TO GET MORE PEOPLE IN

02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:19.919
THERE SO THE SYSTEMS ARE SPOTS

02:04:19.985 --> 02:04:20.519
THAT'S GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF

02:04:20.586 --> 02:04:22.288
EMERGENCY ROOM WAS. WE SHOULD

02:04:22.354 --> 02:04:23.756
GET MORE PEOPLE IN THE

02:04:23.823 --> 02:04:26.392
EMERGENCY ROOM. IT'S THE WAY I

02:04:26.458 --> 02:04:28.561
SCRIPT GET YOU KNOW WE REALLY

02:04:28.627 --> 02:04:29.195
THINK THE CREATES A- GOAL. AND

02:04:29.261 --> 02:04:30.129
TRYING TO GET PAIRS AND

02:04:30.196 --> 02:04:31.430
PROVIDERS TOGETHER AND IT IS IT

02:04:31.497 --> 02:04:33.799
IS ABOUT. ACCOUNTABILITY AND

02:04:33.866 --> 02:04:34.867
TRANSPARENCY BUT THIS IS ALSO

02:04:34.934 --> 02:04:37.169
ABOUT- COLLABORATION BOTH

02:04:37.236 --> 02:04:38.270
WITHIN THE HEALTH SYSTEM FIGURE

02:04:38.337 --> 02:04:39.505
OUT HOW THEY- HOW THEY WORK

02:04:39.572 --> 02:04:41.173
TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE A GOAL. AND

02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:43.342
IT'S ALSO AROUND- ON THE ON THE

02:04:43.409 --> 02:04:44.977
POLICY SIDE HOW DO WE REALLY

02:04:45.044 --> 02:04:46.278
TRY TO BRING FOLKS TOGETHER ON

02:04:46.345 --> 02:04:47.580
A COMMON GOAL AND FIGURE OUT

02:04:47.646 --> 02:04:49.348
WHAT THOSE POLICY LOVERS ARE-

02:04:49.415 --> 02:04:53.219
THE OLD. FAMILY REDUCED COSTS.

02:04:53.285 --> 02:04:54.019
SEEN THIS TO ASSIST IN TARGET

02:04:54.086 --> 02:04:55.321
AND PICKING AN ECONOMIC

02:04:55.387 --> 02:04:58.424
INDICATOR. THE HEALTH CARE.

02:04:58.490 --> 02:05:01.660
LINE WITH. I'M THE GENERAL CAN.

02:05:01.727 --> 02:05:03.529
WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS TO

02:05:03.596 --> 02:05:05.798
IS TO. CLOSE THAT DELTA NO. HOW

02:05:05.865 --> 02:05:13.005
THE HELL. FASTENERS THE ECONOMY.

02:05:13.072 --> 02:05:13.606
I'M WILLING TO TRY. IS JUST ON

02:05:13.672 --> 02:05:14.440
A- HERE WE HAVE A LOT OF DATA

02:05:14.506 --> 02:05:15.975
HAVE A DECEMBER HEALTH CARE BUT

02:05:16.041 --> 02:05:16.876
WE STILL. TO BRING IT TOGETHER

02:05:16.942 --> 02:05:18.577
TO TOLD. STORY OF WHAT'S GOING

02:05:18.644 --> 02:05:19.979
ON THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. OUR

02:05:20.045 --> 02:05:21.046
MEDICAID ACTUARIES ARE

02:05:21.113 --> 02:05:22.681
OPERATING AROUND WHAT'S GOING

02:05:22.748 --> 02:05:24.283
ON MEDICAID ARE. INSURANCE

02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:25.417
ACTUARIES ARE LOOKING WITH

02:05:25.484 --> 02:05:26.051
HAVING THE COMMERCIAL

02:05:26.118 --> 02:05:27.653
INSURANCE. THEY ARE TALKING TO

02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:29.388
ONE ANOTHER. SO I REALLY SEE

02:05:29.455 --> 02:05:30.456
THIS AS A AS A WAY THAT WE

02:05:30.522 --> 02:05:32.024
BRING INFORMATION TOGETHER. I'M

02:05:32.091 --> 02:05:33.759
IN A MORE HOLISTIC FASHION AND

02:05:33.826 --> 02:05:35.127
BILL INFORM THE PUBLIC AND

02:05:35.194 --> 02:05:36.295
POLICY MAKERS. I'M AND

02:05:36.362 --> 02:05:37.663
STAKEHOLDERS- WHAT WERE SEEN AT

02:05:37.730 --> 02:05:40.232
THE CHALLENGES OF THE DAY- AND

02:05:40.299 --> 02:05:43.936
THEN AS WE MENTIONED THIS. WEEK

02:05:44.003 --> 02:05:48.274
WE HOPE THAT METAL ACOSTA. PRO

02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:51.577
WE DROP OR THIS THEM AND FOCUS

02:05:51.644 --> 02:05:52.678
FOCUS CHANGING THE WAY THE PAY

02:05:52.745 --> 02:05:53.679
FOR HEALTH MOVING FROM FEES

02:05:53.746 --> 02:05:55.714
SERVICE TO TOWARDS MORE TO

02:05:55.781 --> 02:05:57.583
ACOSTA CARE CON THAT IMPROVE

02:05:57.650 --> 02:05:59.318
QUALITY AS WELL AND WE'RE GONNA

02:05:59.385 --> 02:06:01.186
BE LEFT FORCE TO DO THIS SO AT

02:06:01.253 --> 02:06:03.188
THE TIME IN A MASSACHUSETTS

02:06:03.255 --> 02:06:05.357
RHODE ISLAND AND- DELAWARE JUMP

02:06:05.424 --> 02:06:06.825
THE GUN AND THE HOUSE THAT THEY

02:06:06.892 --> 02:06:09.695
WERE LAUNCHING PROGRAMS- AND

02:06:09.762 --> 02:06:12.598
THEN CONNECTICUT JUST ANNOUNCED

02:06:12.665 --> 02:06:13.165
TO THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS AND

02:06:13.232 --> 02:06:14.600
THEN- THERE'S A BUILT ON

02:06:14.667 --> 02:06:17.136
WASHINGTON'S WILL. ENSURE FOLKS

02:06:17.202 --> 02:06:18.570
ARE. THIS CON IS NOT ENTIRELY

02:06:18.637 --> 02:06:20.572
NEW TO. DATE WE'VE ACTUALLY

02:06:20.639 --> 02:06:21.941
BEEN STUDYING A PER CAPITA

02:06:22.007 --> 02:06:23.409
TARGET FOR HEALTHCARE

02:06:23.475 --> 02:06:25.277
EXPENDITURES FOR STATE PROGRAMS

02:06:25.344 --> 02:06:26.345
FOR THE BETTER HALF OF THE LAST

02:06:26.412 --> 02:06:28.247
DECADE- WE STARTED IN TWENTY

02:06:28.314 --> 02:06:30.149
TWELVE- BY SETTING A THREE

02:06:30.215 --> 02:06:32.251
POINT 4% TARGET WITH A-

02:06:32.318 --> 02:06:33.986
PROGRAM- THE LEGISLATURE THEN

02:06:34.053 --> 02:06:35.921
EXPANDED THAT TO- PUBLIC

02:06:35.988 --> 02:06:38.924
PROGRAMS- SO. MUCH LIKE- DAVE

02:06:38.991 --> 02:06:39.959
THE EXPERIENCE IN MASSACHUSETTS

02:06:40.025 --> 02:06:41.493
SOME YEARS WE'VE MET THE TARGET

02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:42.661
SOME YEARS WE HAVEN'T BUT

02:06:42.728 --> 02:06:44.096
OVERALL WE HAVE REDUCE THE RATE

02:06:44.163 --> 02:06:45.564
OF GROWTH IN THOSE PROGRAMS.

02:06:45.631 --> 02:06:47.499
WE'VE GOTTEN FOLKS A LINE

02:06:47.566 --> 02:06:48.233
AROUND THAT COMMON GOAL WE'VE

02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:49.468
REALLY STARTED UNDERSTAND

02:06:49.535 --> 02:06:52.871
DRIVERS- IN THAT- AND INVOKES

02:06:52.938 --> 02:06:54.440
REALLY FELT LIKE NOW THAT. THAT

02:06:54.506 --> 02:06:57.676
WE STAND ON THAT AND THE STATE

02:06:57.743 --> 02:07:01.580
HAS TIED IT FELL. BUT AT THIS

02:07:01.647 --> 02:07:03.482
TIME COST. GRAMS BEEN

02:07:03.549 --> 02:07:04.583
SKYROCKETING SO THAT I HERE IS

02:07:04.650 --> 02:07:06.518
TO IS A LITTLE BIT FOR ON OF

02:07:06.585 --> 02:07:08.387
SET ONE TARGET NOW THAT APPLY

02:07:08.454 --> 02:07:10.155
STATEWIDE AND HAD HOLD

02:07:10.222 --> 02:07:10.923
EVERYBODY ACCOUNTABLE TO THE

02:07:10.990 --> 02:07:12.558
SAME TARGETS NOT FAIR THAT I'M

02:07:12.624 --> 02:07:13.459
STATE PROGRAMS ARE TRYING TO

02:07:13.525 --> 02:07:16.028
REDUCE COSTS- WALL ALL OF OUR

02:07:16.095 --> 02:07:19.398
HELD A TARGET IF WE WERE. WE

02:07:19.465 --> 02:07:20.666
ARE SICK. AND WE ARE ABLE TO

02:07:20.733 --> 02:07:22.034
GROW LET'S JUST SAY AT THREE

02:07:22.101 --> 02:07:24.870
POINT 4% OUR STATE TARGET-

02:07:24.937 --> 02:07:26.238
STATEWIDE IF WE REALLY ALL THE

02:07:26.305 --> 02:07:28.574
TARGET ALL THE- ALL THE MARKETS

02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:29.475
TO HIT THAT TARGET. THE

02:07:29.541 --> 02:07:31.143
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THREE POINT

02:07:31.210 --> 02:07:33.645
4% AND THE FOUR POINT 7% THE

02:07:33.712 --> 02:07:35.948
CMS IS FIRST PROJECTING. IS

02:07:36.015 --> 02:07:36.715
TWENTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS FOR

02:07:36.782 --> 02:07:38.450
THE COST SELECT NEXT EIGHT

02:07:38.517 --> 02:07:39.985
YEARS. I REALIZE THIS IS LIKE A

02:07:40.052 --> 02:07:40.953
ROUNDING ERROR IN THE

02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:43.856
CALIFORNIA BUDGET- THIS IS A

02:07:43.922 --> 02:07:45.858
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT AND IN I

02:07:45.924 --> 02:07:47.359
THINK OF THIS IS LIKE A- A

02:07:47.426 --> 02:07:50.195
MORTGAGE OR STUDENT LOAN-

02:07:50.262 --> 02:07:51.030
INTEREST RATE. YOU KNOW

02:07:51.096 --> 02:07:51.930
BRINGING THAT DOWN A HALF A

02:07:51.997 --> 02:07:55.968
PERCENT OR SENATE- MAY NOT SEEM

02:07:56.035 --> 02:07:57.836
LIKE A LOT ANY GIVEN MONTH BUT

02:07:57.903 --> 02:07:59.204
OVER THE COURSE OF. AND THIRTY

02:07:59.271 --> 02:08:03.976
YEARS IT'S- NORMAL. SO WITH THE

02:08:04.043 --> 02:08:05.310
LEAD. IN PASS. LEGISLATION THIS

02:08:05.377 --> 02:08:06.945
LAST. TO CREATE THIS FOR. AND

02:08:07.012 --> 02:08:07.546
WE'RE CALLING SUSTAIN HEALTH

02:08:07.613 --> 02:08:10.249
CARE COSTS GROWTH TARA PROBE

02:08:10.315 --> 02:08:12.518
IT'S A MOUTHFUL BUT- WE THE

02:08:12.584 --> 02:08:13.552
LEAST CUT ONE SYLLABLE OUT BY

OVERSIGHT FOR MORAL POLICY

02:08:23.962 --> 02:08:27.833
BOARD- AT AT IT IN THE BASIC

02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:29.701
FRAMEWORK IS EXACTLY WHAT- WHAT

02:08:29.768 --> 02:08:31.303
MASSACHUSETTS DOES A SET UP

A ANNUAL COST HEARING. OF AN

02:08:35.707 --> 02:08:37.709
ANNUAL COST TRENDS REPORT- BUT

02:08:37.776 --> 02:08:40.312
THERE'S A LOT OF KEY DECISIONS

02:08:40.379 --> 02:08:41.146
UNDERNEATH THAT. THE

02:08:41.213 --> 02:08:42.681
LEGISLATURE. AND IT STAKEHOLDER

02:08:42.748 --> 02:08:45.250
INPUT ON. CREATED AND

02:08:45.317 --> 02:08:46.752
IMPLEMENTATION COMMITTEE.

02:08:46.819 --> 02:08:50.055
EIGHTY THANK. STOOD UP RIGHT

02:08:50.122 --> 02:08:51.390

OUR FRIENDS ON THE EAST COAST

02:08:58.430 --> 02:08:58.997
BUT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT IN

02:08:59.064 --> 02:09:01.467
OREGON THAT WE- BOTH LEARN FROM

02:09:01.533 --> 02:09:02.968
WHAT THEY'VE DONE BUT ALSO FOR

02:09:03.035 --> 02:09:03.869

MOST SENSE FOR WORK AND I THINK

02:09:09.341 --> 02:09:11.076
THAT TO DAVID'S POINT THIS IS

02:09:11.143 --> 02:09:11.677
SOMETHING THAT THE DOCTOR BULL

02:09:11.743 --> 02:09:14.713

RUN THROUGH A COUPLE. TENS OF

02:11:12.998 --> 02:11:14.733
WE'VE MADE TODAY I GUESS STILL

02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:15.367
IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING THIS

02:11:15.434 --> 02:11:16.468
THING AND STUFF A LOT OF WORK

NEXT TEN YEARS. WINSTON PICK

02:11:24.243 --> 02:11:25.611
THREE POINT 4% WHICH IS THE

02:11:25.677 --> 02:11:26.378
TARGET WE HAVE FOR STATE

02:11:31.984 --> 02:11:32.818
PERCENT. THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE

02:11:32.884 --> 02:11:34.786
THEY LANDED- AND THEY ACTUALLY

02:11:34.853 --> 02:11:35.921

SORT OF IN THAT TOO. AFTER FOUR

02:11:44.296 --> 02:11:46.298
RANGE TO THREE POINT FOUR. SEEM

02:11:46.365 --> 02:11:47.566
LIKE A GOOD STARTING POINT- BUT

02:11:47.633 --> 02:11:49.501
ALSO- SAID THAT IN FIVE YEARS

02:11:49.568 --> 02:11:50.702
FOR. THE RESERVE A DEFAULT

02:11:50.769 --> 02:11:52.938

FIVE AND FIGURE OUT THAT STILL

02:11:57.576 --> 02:11:58.844
MAKES SENSE SO. I'M STARTING

02:11:58.910 --> 02:11:59.911
THREE POINT 4% A TRUCK BUT

02:11:59.978 --> 02:12:02.481

BE THE MOST COMPLICATED AND

02:12:25.604 --> 02:12:27.839
THERE'S A VARIETY OF WAYS TO DO

02:12:27.906 --> 02:12:29.408
THAT ME IN IT GETS A LITTLE.

02:12:29.474 --> 02:12:30.042
COMPLICATED BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO

IF WE CAN GET TO THE NINETY.

02:13:05.444 --> 02:13:07.279
95% RANGE THAT'S PROBABLY

02:13:07.346 --> 02:13:08.914
PRETTY GOOD- AND A LOT OF THE

02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:10.482
STUFF BE ON THAT'S PROBABLY NOT

LOWER ISSUE THAT WE DON'T HAVE

02:14:33.532 --> 02:14:34.800
A FULL LINE OF SIGHT IN TERMS

02:14:34.866 --> 02:14:36.968
OF WHAT THAT ACTUAL NET COST IS

02:14:37.035 --> 02:14:39.404
BECAUSE- A CLEAN GETS PAID

02:14:39.471 --> 02:14:40.739
WITHIN A REBATE COMES BACK AND

02:14:40.806 --> 02:14:43.408
SO THE IDEAS WILL CLICK WILL

START COLLECTING SOME AGGREGATE

02:14:44.109 --> 02:14:45.877
PHARMACY RELATED INFORMATION SO

02:14:45.944 --> 02:14:47.579

TO GET START TO GET IN THE

02:15:11.102 --> 02:15:12.604
RHYTHM OF MEASURING COSTING

02:15:12.671 --> 02:15:15.407
COST TRENDS AND START TO- GET

02:15:15.474 --> 02:15:16.775
THAT RHYTHM OF HOW DO WE HAVE

02:15:16.842 --> 02:15:18.376
THOSE COMMUNITY CONVERSATIONS

02:15:18.443 --> 02:15:20.278
WE PLAN THAT. HAVE ARE FOR ONE.

IN. SO YOU PUT THROUGH A COUPLE

02:16:06.992 --> 02:16:11.096
OF OTHER STATE. MARYLAND IN

02:16:11.162 --> 02:16:12.531
RHODE ISLAND SO A REVIEW

02:16:12.597 --> 02:16:14.065
BRIEFLY THESE TWO OTHER STATES

02:16:14.132 --> 02:16:16.067
WITH- COMMISSIONS MARYLAND IS

02:16:16.134 --> 02:16:18.003
CLEARLY THE GRANDFATHER OF ALL

02:16:18.069 --> 02:16:20.272
STATE COMMISSIONS DATING BACK

02:16:20.338 --> 02:16:21.840
TO NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO- AND

02:16:21.907 --> 02:16:23.341
STILL GOING STRONG THE WITH

02:16:23.408 --> 02:16:25.410
MANY CHANGES AND THAT'S ONE OF

02:16:25.477 --> 02:16:26.745
THE THINGS THAT WE SAW IN OUR

02:16:26.811 --> 02:16:28.380
WORD IS THAT ALL OF THESE

02:16:28.446 --> 02:16:29.848
COMMISSIONS HAVE VICE OVER

02:16:29.915 --> 02:16:32.584
TIME. I THINK UNLESS IT IS NOT

02:16:32.651 --> 02:16:34.219
IF WE DO IT HERE WE'RE NOT

02:16:34.286 --> 02:16:34.819
GOING TO FIGURE OUT IN ADVANCE

02:16:34.886 --> 02:16:37.122
WHAT THE BEST MODEL AND ALL THE

02:16:37.188 --> 02:16:39.224
DETAILS ARE KIND OF THING THAT

02:16:39.291 --> 02:16:40.292
AS WE LEARN LEARN AS WE GO

02:16:40.358 --> 02:16:43.528
FORWARD- THE RHODE ISLAND IS

02:16:43.595 --> 02:16:44.296
MORE RECENT BUT IT WAS

02:16:44.362 --> 02:16:46.231
ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND

02:16:46.298 --> 02:16:49.301
FOUR AND ALSO HAS EVOLVED WITH

02:16:49.367 --> 02:16:50.902
CHANGES OVER TIME. AS SEVEN

02:16:50.969 --> 02:16:52.938
COME. BOTH HAVE COME IS

02:16:53.004 --> 02:16:54.606
APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR- IF

02:16:54.673 --> 02:16:55.907
YOU HAVE DETAILED QUESTIONS

02:16:55.974 --> 02:16:57.175
ABOUT MARYLAND WE ACTUALLY HAVE

02:16:57.242 --> 02:16:58.743
A FORMER COMMISSIONER HERE WITH

02:16:58.810 --> 02:17:00.445
US TODAY. BOB VERY AND HE COULD

02:17:00.512 --> 02:17:02.047
PROVIDE A LOT MORE DETAIL THAN

02:17:02.113 --> 02:17:04.249
I CAN I'M SURE. BOTH HAVE

02:17:04.316 --> 02:17:05.283
EXTENSIVE DATA REPORTING

02:17:05.350 --> 02:17:07.285
REQUIREMENTS WITH SUPPLEMENTAL

02:17:07.352 --> 02:17:08.720
SUPPORT FOR A SENT THIS

02:17:08.787 --> 02:17:10.455
ESSENTIAL FUNCTION. AND AGAIN

02:17:10.522 --> 02:17:12.824
THE THEME OF DATA. JUST KEEP

02:17:12.891 --> 02:17:14.826
BECOMES CLEARER AND CLEARER-

02:17:14.893 --> 02:17:16.294
FROM EVERYTHING I HEAR AND READ

02:17:16.361 --> 02:17:18.997
ABOUT THESE- FUNCTIONS.

02:17:19.064 --> 02:17:20.699
MARYLAND HAS IT ALL PAY OUR

02:17:20.765 --> 02:17:22.801
GLOBAL BUDGET SYSTEM FOR

02:17:22.867 --> 02:17:24.636
HOSPITALS NOW SO THEY SAID A

02:17:24.703 --> 02:17:27.105
GLOBAL BUDGET. BUT IT FOCUSES

02:17:27.172 --> 02:17:29.808
ONLY ON HOSPITALS- IT HAS A

02:17:29.874 --> 02:17:31.643
DIFFERENT SET OF POLISH POLICY

02:17:31.710 --> 02:17:33.645
FOR RURAL HOSPITALS RECOGNIZING

02:17:33.712 --> 02:17:36.715
THEIR DIFFERENT SITUATION OTHER

02:17:36.781 --> 02:17:39.184
FACTORS THAT AFFECT THEM. THE A

02:17:39.250 --> 02:17:41.686
THERE'S SEVERAL LIMITATIONS ARE

02:17:41.753 --> 02:17:45.490
CHALLENGES TO- TO- THE GLOBAL

02:17:45.557 --> 02:17:47.292
BUDGET FOLKSINGER HOSPITALS

02:17:47.359 --> 02:17:48.493
WELL HOSPITALS ARE THE BIGGEST

02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:50.762
PIECE ABOUT ONE THIRD IT'S ONLY

02:17:50.829 --> 02:17:52.931
ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE RIGHT

02:17:52.998 --> 02:17:54.199
AND ALSO SETTING HOSPITAL

02:17:54.265 --> 02:17:57.268
BUDGETS IS A COMPLEX AND ALSO.

02:17:57.335 --> 02:17:58.570
EXERCISE OFF WOULD CUT

02:17:58.637 --> 02:18:00.472
REQUIRING LOTS OF VERY DETAILED

02:18:00.538 --> 02:18:02.841
DATA ONE SO WHILE THE POLICY

02:18:02.907 --> 02:18:04.709
ALSO FROM HOSPITALS PROVIDES A

02:18:04.776 --> 02:18:07.012
MORE STABLE REVENUE SOURCE IT

02:18:07.078 --> 02:18:10.015
ALSO IS SUBJECT TO THE

02:18:10.081 --> 02:18:11.416
COMPLEXITY OF HOW DO YOU DEAL

02:18:11.483 --> 02:18:12.917
WITH FACTORS YOUNG TROLL THE

02:18:12.984 --> 02:18:15.220
HOSPITAL DOING ADJUSTMENTS.

02:18:15.286 --> 02:18:17.222
THINGS LIKE THAT. MERYL HOWEVER

02:18:17.288 --> 02:18:18.490
HAS THE BROADER SCOPE AS WAS

02:18:18.556 --> 02:18:19.991
MENTIONED EARLIER IN TERMS OF

02:18:20.058 --> 02:18:21.793
THE FACT THAT COVERS MEDICARE

02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:23.862
AS WELL AS MEDICAID THIS IS DUE

02:18:23.928 --> 02:18:26.164
TO ITS UNIQUE WAIVER FROM C.

02:18:26.231 --> 02:18:27.899
EVENTS THAT MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE

02:18:27.966 --> 02:18:29.901
OTHER STATES WOULD NOT BE WITH

02:18:29.968 --> 02:18:32.537
ABLE TO. ACHIEVE RHODE ISLAND

02:18:32.604 --> 02:18:33.338
MODEL IS A HEALTH INSURANCE

02:18:33.405 --> 02:18:34.806
PREMIUM MODEL PLUS

02:18:34.873 --> 02:18:37.642
AFFORDABILITY STANDARDS SO.

02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:39.544
INITIALLY THIS MODEL FOCUSES ON

02:18:39.611 --> 02:18:42.313
REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF PREMIUMS

02:18:42.380 --> 02:18:43.648
BUT VERY QUICKLY AS YOU STUDY

02:18:43.715 --> 02:18:46.251
YOU REALIZE IT GOES BENEATH.

02:18:46.317 --> 02:18:48.853
PREMIUMS TO LOOK AT THE

02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:49.788
UNDERLYING FACTORS THERE

02:18:49.854 --> 02:18:51.856
DRIVING PREMIUM GROWTH WHICH IS

02:18:51.923 --> 02:18:53.792
I THINK ESSENTIAL IF YOU IF YOU

02:18:53.858 --> 02:18:55.293
IF YOU JUST LOOK AT PREMIUMS

02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:57.495
LET'S. TRY TO PUT A CAP ON A

02:18:57.562 --> 02:18:58.797
VOLCANO YOU'RE NOT REALLY

02:18:58.863 --> 02:19:00.699
LOOKING AT THE FALLING LOVE

02:19:00.765 --> 02:19:03.401
UNDER THE THAT'S GOING TO PUSH

02:19:03.468 --> 02:19:05.203
THAT CAP. UP THE COME. THROUGH

02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:07.338
RULE OF FOR. AND THEY

02:19:07.405 --> 02:19:07.872
ESTABLISHED A STATE WIDE

02:19:07.939 --> 02:19:12.177
SPENDING CAP AND- THEY INCLUDE

02:19:12.243 --> 02:19:15.747
THESE AFFORDABILITY BETTER KIND

02:19:15.814 --> 02:19:17.782
OF GENERAL LANGUAGE AS I

02:19:17.849 --> 02:19:19.584
UNDERSTAND IT IN THEIR

02:19:19.651 --> 02:19:22.487
LEGISLATION. WELL AS THIS GIVES

02:19:22.554 --> 02:19:23.088
THE ABILITY THE COME TO MAKE

02:19:23.154 --> 02:19:25.790
BROAD CHANGE THAT FLOW FROM

02:19:25.857 --> 02:19:27.192
THESE AFFORDABLE FOR

02:19:27.258 --> 02:19:29.561
AFFORDABILITY LANGUAGE. THAT

02:19:29.627 --> 02:19:31.329
ALLOWS THEM TO REACH DOWN INTO

02:19:31.396 --> 02:19:32.864
CONTRACTS BETWEEN HEALTH PLANS

02:19:32.931 --> 02:19:35.266
AND HOSPITALS FOR EXAMPLE. AND

02:19:35.333 --> 02:19:37.102
OTHER CHANGES THAT GET AT THE

02:19:37.168 --> 02:19:39.838
UNDERLYING COST TRENDS THAT

02:19:39.904 --> 02:19:42.941
ACTUALLY DRIVE PREMIUMS A

02:19:43.007 --> 02:19:44.609
CLOSING COMMENTS I JUST HAVE A

02:19:44.676 --> 02:19:46.344
COUPLE OF A SET OF COMMENTS

02:19:46.411 --> 02:19:49.314
HERE. ONE IS IN STUDY THESE

02:19:49.380 --> 02:19:50.148
OTHER STATES THE NUMBER OF

02:19:50.215 --> 02:19:53.051
LESSONS OUR CURRENT SYSTEM.

02:19:53.118 --> 02:19:54.919
NEARLY LACKS TRANSPARENCY AND

02:19:54.986 --> 02:19:56.821
AS IS LOST COMPETITIVENESS

02:19:56.888 --> 02:19:58.289
WHICH IS LEADING TO HIGHER

02:19:58.356 --> 02:20:01.292
PRICES HIGHER SPENDING. SLOWING

02:20:01.359 --> 02:20:02.227
COST GROWTH WILL BE VERY

02:20:02.293 --> 02:20:04.262
DIFFICULT. I WITH WITHOUT THE

02:20:04.329 --> 02:20:07.332
DATA I THINK IMPOSSIBLE. I KNOW

02:20:07.398 --> 02:20:08.900
IN MY OWN RESEARCH WHEN I

02:20:08.967 --> 02:20:10.869
PUBLISHED A PAPER THAT SOMEONE

02:20:10.935 --> 02:20:12.904
DOESN'T LIKE THE FIRST THING

02:20:12.971 --> 02:20:14.372
THEY SAY IS. YOU DON'T HAVE THE

02:20:14.439 --> 02:20:15.740
RIGHT DATA. IT'S NOT THE RIGHT

02:20:15.807 --> 02:20:17.575
TIME PERIOD OR IT'S JUST

02:20:17.642 --> 02:20:20.211
CALIFORNIA OR WHATEVER BUT WE

02:20:20.278 --> 02:20:21.579
DON'T WANT THE DEBATE TO BE

02:20:21.646 --> 02:20:23.515
ABOUT THE DATA. WE NEED GOOD

02:20:23.581 --> 02:20:25.216
THAT WE NEED TO AGREE ON WHAT

02:20:25.283 --> 02:20:26.417
WE'RE DOING OUR MEASURING IT.

02:20:26.484 --> 02:20:28.720
WE WANT TO DEBATE. ABOUT POLICY

02:20:28.787 --> 02:20:31.089
WHAT TRADE OFFS FOR MEASURING

02:20:31.156 --> 02:20:32.624
THESE TRADE OFFS CORRECTLY

02:20:32.690 --> 02:20:34.859
ACCURATELY WITH AGREEDUPON

02:20:34.926 --> 02:20:37.061
MEASURES. THAT WE CAN OF

02:20:37.128 --> 02:20:42.167
MEANINGFUL WORTHWHILE DEBATE.

02:20:42.233 --> 02:20:43.968
ON THE OTHER HAND. WE CAN WAIT

02:20:44.035 --> 02:20:46.871
FOR EVERYTHING I THE- TO. MOVE

02:20:46.938 --> 02:20:48.606
FORWARD AS AS STORE GATHERING.

02:20:48.673 --> 02:20:50.141
START MAKE IT AVAILABLE AND

02:20:50.208 --> 02:20:53.011
START THIS THIS THIS PATH OF

02:20:53.077 --> 02:20:55.046
MAKING TRANSPARENCY GREATER FOR

02:20:55.113 --> 02:20:58.149
OUR SYSTEM. AND THEN FINALLY WE

02:20:58.216 --> 02:21:02.120
NEED TO DEVELOP. THE BENCH AND

02:21:02.187 --> 02:21:03.688
BENT BENCH AND TRACK THEM

02:21:03.755 --> 02:21:05.290
AGAINST MULTIPLE BENCHMARKS

02:21:05.356 --> 02:21:07.725
RIGHT SO THE IDEA AFFORDABILITY

02:21:07.792 --> 02:21:09.360
WE LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE THANKS

02:21:09.427 --> 02:21:10.495
MORE SORT OF TOTAL HEALTHCARE

02:21:10.562 --> 02:21:12.597
SPENDING WELL THEY COULD BE

02:21:12.664 --> 02:21:14.566
DIFFERENT TRENDS FOR DIFFERENT

02:21:14.632 --> 02:21:15.867
SUBPOPULATIONS MEDICARE

02:21:15.934 --> 02:21:18.903
MEDICAID- SELF INSURED

02:21:18.970 --> 02:21:20.638
EMPLOYERS COMMERCIALLY SHORT

02:21:20.705 --> 02:21:22.707
ALL OF THEM MAYBE STICK TO

02:21:22.774 --> 02:21:24.509
SEPARATE DIFFERENT TRENDS A

02:21:24.576 --> 02:21:25.710
DIFFERENT PRESSURE. THEN WE

02:21:25.777 --> 02:21:27.912
POCKET SPENDING SO WITH MORE

02:21:27.979 --> 02:21:30.481
COMPREHENSIVE MEASURES OF BOTH

02:21:30.548 --> 02:21:32.283
COST AND AFFORDABILITY YOU'VE

02:21:32.350 --> 02:21:34.118
REALLY GOT TO MAKE CHRIS- AND

02:21:34.185 --> 02:21:35.720
THEN FOR ALSO WE NEED I THINK A

02:21:35.787 --> 02:21:37.422
STRUCTURE THAT PROVIDES BOTH

02:21:37.488 --> 02:21:39.791
INDEPENDENCE TO MAKE THESE ARE

02:21:39.858 --> 02:21:41.793
DECISIONS AND A GREAT DATA TO

02:21:41.860 --> 02:21:43.895
SUPPORT THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:21:43.962 --> 02:21:47.098
NOT GOING TO BE EASILY ACCEPTED

02:21:47.165 --> 02:21:51.102
BY EVERYONE. THANK THAT'S

02:21:51.169 --> 02:21:54.739
COMMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU

02:21:54.806 --> 02:21:55.340
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH IF YOU

PLEASE STAY WE'RE GONNA HAVE SO

02:29:56.620 --> 02:29:58.489
THE BENCHMARK AT ANY. AT ANY

02:29:58.556 --> 02:30:00.958
RATE. AND SO THAT DOES REQUIRE

02:30:01.025 --> 02:30:03.728
A PUBLIC PROCESS AND INPUT AND

02:30:03.794 --> 02:30:04.829
ACTUALLY REPORT BACK TO THE

02:30:04.895 --> 02:30:07.098
LEGISLATURE. I THINK PART OF

02:30:07.164 --> 02:30:09.066
THESE WERE A COMPROMISE WERE

02:30:09.133 --> 02:30:10.568
MADE ALONG THE WAY TO KIND OF

02:30:10.634 --> 02:30:13.237
OKAY. HOW DO OVER TIME PEOPLE.

TRUSTING THE DATA TRUSTING WHAT

02:30:15.973 --> 02:30:18.976
THIS IS STAN. HOW THE AGE PC

02:30:19.043 --> 02:30:20.745
MAKES DECISIONS BEFORE KIND OF.

02:30:20.811 --> 02:30:22.246
COMPLETELY OPENING UP OUR

02:30:22.313 --> 02:30:23.981
ABILITY TO MAKE THOSE TYPES OF

02:30:24.048 --> 02:30:25.716
ADJUSTMENTS HI SO KIND OF

02:30:25.783 --> 02:30:30.221
ESCALATING- FLEXIBILITY. SO YOU

02:30:30.287 --> 02:30:31.422
WHEN YOU COLLECT THE YOU YOU

PROCESS TO THE YEAR IS THAT-

02:30:36.427 --> 02:30:37.928
RESULTS OF THAT PUBLIC FOR

02:30:37.995 --> 02:30:40.464
EXAMPLE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN

02:30:40.531 --> 02:30:43.134
ACTUALLY SEE OR YOU IS OUT ALL

02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:45.669
KEPT BEHIND THE SCENES SO THAT.

02:30:45.736 --> 02:30:48.005
OTHER PLAYERS CAN SEE- THEY DID

02:30:48.072 --> 02:30:49.774
BETTER THAN ME OR OR WHATEVER

HELD TIGHTLY WITHIN THE

02:30:53.778 --> 02:30:56.013
ORGANIZATION. SO THE ONE PIECE

02:30:56.080 --> 02:30:58.182
THAT IS CONFIDENTIAL IS THIS

02:30:58.249 --> 02:30:59.817
IDENTIFICATION OF INDIVIDUAL

02:30:59.884 --> 02:31:02.153
PROVIDERS IN INDIVIDUAL HEALTH

02:31:02.219 --> 02:31:04.388
PLANS THAT HAVE IT. I COST

02:31:04.455 --> 02:31:06.457
GROWTH- ABOVE THE BENCHMARK SO

02:31:06.524 --> 02:31:07.825
THAT IS THAT IS HELD

02:31:07.892 --> 02:31:09.760
CONFIDENTIAL ME DO NOT DISCLOSE

02:31:09.827 --> 02:31:10.194
THE NAMES OF THOSE

02:31:10.261 --> 02:31:13.597
ORGANIZATIONS ON THE LAST. WEEK

02:31:13.664 --> 02:31:16.167
A LACK TO REQUIRE A PERFORMANCE

02:31:16.233 --> 02:31:18.102
IMPROVEMENT PLAN. AT THAT POINT

02:31:18.169 --> 02:31:19.203
THEN THAT ENTITIES NAME

02:31:19.270 --> 02:31:20.671
PUBLICLY THEIR POSTED ON OUR

02:31:20.738 --> 02:31:22.206
WEBSITE AND THERE'S A LOT OF

02:31:22.273 --> 02:31:25.176
PUBLIC PROCESS TO THAT- I THINK

02:31:25.242 --> 02:31:26.944
THERE ARE WAYS TO. APPROACH AS

02:31:27.011 --> 02:31:29.947
I SAY THAT. HAVING THAT PROCESS

02:31:30.014 --> 02:31:34.218
BE. FINANCIAL ALLOW FOR I THINK

02:31:34.285 --> 02:31:36.720
I UNDERSTANDING THAT IN ONE

02:31:36.787 --> 02:31:38.789
YEAR WITH ONE MAYBE A SMALL

02:31:38.856 --> 02:31:40.257
PROVIDER THAT THEIR PATIENT

02:31:40.324 --> 02:31:42.493
POPULATION CHANGED AND IT'S NOT

02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:43.427
REALLY THROUGH ANY FAULT OF

02:31:43.494 --> 02:31:45.029
THEIR OWN THAT THEY ENDED UP ON

02:31:45.095 --> 02:31:46.530
THAT LIST AND YOU YOU KNOW YOU

02:31:46.597 --> 02:31:47.498
MAY NOT WANT TO SAY HEY YOU'RE

02:31:47.565 --> 02:31:48.899
ON THE YOU KNOW THE QUOTE

02:31:48.966 --> 02:31:51.502
UNQUOTE- NADIE WEST- WHICH IS

02:31:51.569 --> 02:31:53.204
NOT INTENDED TO BE BUT

02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:54.338
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A PERCEPTION

02:31:54.405 --> 02:31:56.106
THAT IF YOUR NAME PUBLICLY. YOU

02:31:56.173 --> 02:31:57.308
KNOW YOU YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING

02:31:57.374 --> 02:31:59.243
YOU'RE NOT COMMITTED TO THE

02:31:59.310 --> 02:32:00.277
VALUES AND THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS

02:32:00.344 --> 02:32:02.780
BE THE CASE AND SO IT DOES

02:32:02.847 --> 02:32:03.881
ALLOW FOR A LITTLE BIT OF KIND

02:32:03.948 --> 02:32:06.183
OF A SEEKS A SAFE THOSE

02:32:06.250 --> 02:32:08.786
COMMERCE TO OCCUR BUT AGAIN IF

02:32:08.853 --> 02:32:10.354
THE BOARD DETERMINES THAT THERE

02:32:10.421 --> 02:32:12.389
IS AN ISSUE THERE I A PROBLEM

02:32:12.456 --> 02:32:14.558
AND THIS ENTITY IS NOT DOING

02:32:14.625 --> 02:32:17.161
ITS PART OR COULD BE DOING MORE

02:32:17.228 --> 02:32:18.796
TO CONSTRAIN HELP ACOSTA THEN

02:32:18.863 --> 02:32:19.830
THERE'S THAT'S PUBLIC AND

02:32:19.897 --> 02:32:23.934
THERE'S FURTHER ACTION TAKEN.

02:32:24.001 --> 02:32:24.768
TO MENTION. YOU PARTNER WITH

02:32:24.835 --> 02:32:27.505
PEOPLE. CAN USE OF GRAN TO HOW.

02:32:27.571 --> 02:32:28.539
IMPROVE QUALITY WE'RE SOME

02:32:28.606 --> 02:32:30.441
MONEY COME FROM FOR GRANTS. SO

02:32:30.508 --> 02:32:31.876
WE ACTUALLY RECEIVED AS PART OF

02:32:31.942 --> 02:32:33.744
OUR NATIONAL LEGISLATION- AN

02:32:33.811 --> 02:32:35.980
INFLUX OF OVER A HUNDRED

02:32:36.046 --> 02:32:37.882
MILLION DOLLARS- BASICALLY

02:32:37.948 --> 02:32:40.184
FROM- AN ASSESSMENT A ONE TIME

02:32:40.251 --> 02:32:42.019
ASSESSMENT ON OUR HEALTH PLANS.

02:32:42.086 --> 02:32:43.921
ARE ARE HEALTH COMPANIES- SO

02:32:43.988 --> 02:32:46.257
THERE IS A ONE TIME. INVESTMENT

02:32:46.323 --> 02:32:48.125
THAT WAS PUT INTO A TRUST FUND

02:32:48.192 --> 02:32:48.792
THAT THAT WE COULD USE. TO

02:32:48.859 --> 02:32:51.495

MAKE INVESTMENTS AND HOW DO YOU

02:32:55.132 --> 02:32:57.001
ACTUALLY CHANGE THE DELIVERY OF

02:32:57.067 --> 02:32:58.569
CARE- AND HOW WE WORK WITH

02:32:58.636 --> 02:33:00.170
PROVIDERS TO DO THAT-

02:33:00.237 --> 02:33:02.773
INCREDIBLE SUCCESS THROUGH THAT

02:33:02.840 --> 02:33:04.575
THOSE PROGRAMS A- AND FOR

02:33:04.642 --> 02:33:07.978
PROVIDERS WHO ARE NOT. YES THIS

02:33:08.045 --> 02:33:12.449
IS. THE BIGGEST SUCCESSFUL.

02:33:12.516 --> 02:33:14.618
PROVIDERS IS A- PRETTY HOT. IN

02:33:14.685 --> 02:33:15.953
FAR FOR PARTS OF OUR SMALL.

02:33:16.020 --> 02:33:16.787
THEY DON'T HAVE AN- TO. YOU

02:33:16.854 --> 02:33:18.556
KNOW HUGE IN DOWN. OR RESERVES

02:33:18.622 --> 02:33:19.823
AND SO IS THE WAY IT'S HOW CAN%

02:33:19.890 --> 02:33:20.658
WE- SERVE TO MAKE SOME INITIAL

02:33:20.724 --> 02:33:23.494
IN. IN ROLL AWAY. SO THAT'S

02:33:23.561 --> 02:33:25.129
FROM WE INTEREST RATES OR

02:33:25.195 --> 02:33:27.965
GAMING IN MASS. RECENTLY AND

02:33:28.032 --> 02:33:29.700
THE CASINOS HAD TO MAKE A ONE

02:33:29.767 --> 02:33:31.769
TIME- A LICENSE FEE SOME OF

02:33:31.835 --> 02:33:33.170
THAT MONEY WAS DIVERTED TECH SO

02:33:33.237 --> 02:33:34.905
IT WAS A ONE TIME KIND OF. YOU

02:33:34.972 --> 02:33:38.042
KNOW KIND OF A- INVESTMENT. IN

02:33:38.108 --> 02:33:40.611
THE FUTURE. SO HAVE YOU.

02:33:40.678 --> 02:33:41.812
OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THINKING

02:33:41.879 --> 02:33:44.014
THINKING YOU KNOW HEALTHCARE IS

02:33:44.081 --> 02:33:47.418
A VERY- LABOR INTENSIVE-

02:33:47.484 --> 02:33:49.253
INDUSTRY OBVIOUSLY I MEANING

02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:50.554
YOU IT'S PRETTY HARD TO DO

02:33:50.621 --> 02:33:51.422
HEALTH CARE WITHOUT HEALTH CARE

02:33:51.488 --> 02:33:54.091
PROVIDERS SO DID IN IN THE

02:33:54.158 --> 02:33:56.060
QUEST FOR PEOPLE TO REACH THEIR

02:33:56.126 --> 02:33:58.696
BENCHMARKS DID YOU SEE ANY HAVE

02:33:58.762 --> 02:33:59.863
YOU SEEN ANY KNEE JERK

02:33:59.930 --> 02:34:01.899
REACTIONS THAT WILL JUST START

02:34:01.966 --> 02:34:02.633
YOU KNOW WITH CERTAIN SOME

02:34:02.700 --> 02:34:04.134
STAFF GO TO REDUCE OUR COSTS

02:34:04.201 --> 02:34:05.736
AND GET INTO THE UNDER THE

02:34:05.803 --> 02:34:07.204
UNDER THE BENCHMARKS IF YOU DID

02:34:07.271 --> 02:34:08.839
YOU SEE ANY OF THAT. SO I

02:34:08.906 --> 02:34:10.774
BECAUSE YOU DID MENTION YEAH-

02:34:10.841 --> 02:34:13.344
OR SO SOMEWHERE MAYBE SOMEBODY

02:34:13.410 --> 02:34:14.745
MENTIONED THAT THAT WAGES

02:34:14.812 --> 02:34:16.580
HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN THAT WAY

02:34:16.647 --> 02:34:18.115
JUST CONTINUE TO GROW SO I'M

02:34:18.182 --> 02:34:20.651
CURIOUS DID YOU DID WAS A KNEE

02:34:20.718 --> 02:34:21.919
JERK REACTION IN SOME IN SOME

02:34:21.986 --> 02:34:24.488
SECTORS TO JETTISON EMPLOYEES

02:34:24.555 --> 02:34:29.994
IT UNDER THE AGE MARK. NOW I

02:34:30.060 --> 02:34:30.694
THINK THERE ARE. CIRCA WHERE

02:34:30.761 --> 02:34:32.062
INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS OF HAD TO

02:34:32.129 --> 02:34:35.566
TAKE. YOU KNOW- MAKE SOME SOME

02:34:35.633 --> 02:34:36.300
ADJUSTMENTS TO THEIR

02:34:36.367 --> 02:34:38.302
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS- BUT WHEN

02:34:38.369 --> 02:34:39.536
YOU LOOK STATEWIDE AND YOU LOOK

02:34:39.603 --> 02:34:41.338
ACROSS THE ENTIRE SECTOR OUR

02:34:41.405 --> 02:34:43.374
HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE IS GROUND-

02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:46.210
OVER THIS PERIOD OF TIME- AND

02:34:46.276 --> 02:34:47.144
CONTINUES TO BE A BACKBONE OF

02:34:47.211 --> 02:34:48.746
THIS SO WE DO NOT SEE ANY

02:34:48.812 --> 02:34:50.180
SYSTEMATIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

02:34:50.247 --> 02:34:51.181
THE TWO AND THAT IS NOT

02:34:51.248 --> 02:34:52.116
SOMETHING THAT THE PROVIDERS.

02:34:52.182 --> 02:34:54.485
NECESSARILY TELLING US. NOW

02:34:54.551 --> 02:34:56.620
UNDERSTANDING THAT LABOR IS A

02:34:56.687 --> 02:34:58.756
PRESSURE AND CERTAINLY

02:34:58.822 --> 02:35:00.357
SOMETHING THAT AS IN. A TINY

02:35:00.424 --> 02:35:02.292
MARKET THERE THERE CERTAINLY

02:35:02.359 --> 02:35:04.561
ARE RAISING TO US. BUT WE'VE

02:35:04.628 --> 02:35:06.230
ALSO SEEN OUR WORKFORCE CHANGE-

02:35:06.296 --> 02:35:08.298
THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PART

02:35:08.365 --> 02:35:09.400
OF THIS TO- WARNER

02:35:09.466 --> 02:35:12.269
PRACTITIONERS MORE LICENSE

02:35:12.336 --> 02:35:13.971
CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER. WITH

02:35:14.038 --> 02:35:15.506
WORKERS CLINICAL AND NON CLICK

02:35:15.572 --> 02:35:16.840
STAFF ALL WORKING TOGETHER IN

02:35:16.907 --> 02:35:19.009
MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS TO TRY

02:35:19.076 --> 02:35:19.777
TO BUY CARE SO THAT THE

02:35:19.843 --> 02:35:21.245
WORKFORCE IS CHANGING AT THE

02:35:21.311 --> 02:35:23.447
SAME TIME. THAT'S NOT TO SAY

02:35:23.514 --> 02:35:24.181
THAT WE DON'T HAVE A BIG

02:35:24.248 --> 02:35:26.016
CHALLENGES ESPECIALLY IN THE

02:35:26.083 --> 02:35:26.483
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE

02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:29.086
WORKFORCE- AND THAT'S SOMETHING

02:35:29.153 --> 02:35:31.221
AND IN PRIMARY CARE- AND I DO

02:35:31.288 --> 02:35:32.756
WANT TO MENTION JUST ONE

02:35:32.823 --> 02:35:34.925
INNOVATION THAT ARE GOVERNOR'S

02:35:34.992 --> 02:35:36.260
PROPOSING. AS WE TAKE THIS

02:35:36.326 --> 02:35:37.494
EXPERIMENT MOVING FORWARD.

02:35:37.561 --> 02:35:39.496
HOWEVER HE IS PROPOSING THAT

02:35:39.563 --> 02:35:41.665
FOR THE NEXT PHASE OF THIS THIS

02:35:41.732 --> 02:35:44.168
AFTER. THAT WE STILL KEEP OUR

02:35:44.234 --> 02:35:46.837
THREE POINT 1% ANNUAL TARGET.

02:35:46.904 --> 02:35:49.006
BUT THE FACT THAT WE ACTUALLY

02:35:49.073 --> 02:35:50.674
SET SUB TARGETS FOR GROWING

02:35:50.741 --> 02:35:53.010
SPENDING IN AREAS LIKE PRIMARY

02:35:53.077 --> 02:35:55.245
CARE AND BEHAVIOR HEALTH CARE.

02:35:55.312 --> 02:35:57.448
AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN UNDER

02:35:57.514 --> 02:36:04.288
INVESTED IN HISTORIC. LEGAL YOU

02:36:04.354 --> 02:36:09.993
HAVE. HOUSE STRONG. ACCESS

02:36:10.060 --> 02:36:10.494
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A AND

02:36:10.561 --> 02:36:12.963
STRONGER SO. WE TALKED A LITTLE

02:36:13.030 --> 02:36:13.597
BIT EARLY ABOUT THAT ADDED TO

02:36:13.664 --> 02:36:14.498
THAT OF ALL THE OCCURRING IN

02:36:14.565 --> 02:36:15.532
THIS IS ONE OF NEW I. THAT IS

02:36:15.599 --> 02:36:16.667
OUT THERE IS TO SAY IT'S A YES

02:36:16.734 --> 02:36:19.269
KEEP THE TOTAL TARGET. BUT

02:36:19.336 --> 02:36:20.471
LET'S TRY TO MAKE SOME

02:36:20.537 --> 02:36:21.572
INVESTMENTS IN AREAS THAT WE

02:36:21.638 --> 02:36:22.439
THINK ARE GOING TO PROVIDE THE

02:36:22.506 --> 02:36:24.174
GREATEST AMOUNT OF VALUE IN THE

02:36:24.241 --> 02:36:26.276
LONG TERM- SO THOSE ARE THAT'S

02:36:26.343 --> 02:36:28.812
ONE EXAMPLE OF A NEW INNOVATION

02:36:28.879 --> 02:36:30.314
AND A NEW EVOLUTION. CAL COULD

02:36:30.380 --> 02:36:31.915
THINK ABOUT THIS IS YES HAVING.

02:36:31.982 --> 02:36:34.218
A BIG TARGET- YOU KNOW A BIG

02:36:34.284 --> 02:36:36.086
STATEWIDE TARGET BUT HAVING AS

02:36:36.153 --> 02:36:37.187
GLENN SAID THOSE SUB PAR GET

02:36:37.254 --> 02:36:38.622
SICK YOU'RE TRACKING WHERE THE

02:36:38.689 --> 02:36:40.491
DOLLARS GOING WHERE. WHERE ARE

02:36:40.557 --> 02:36:41.325
THOSE INVESTMENTS HAPPY AND

02:36:41.391 --> 02:36:42.593
THERE ARE THEY GOING IN THE

02:36:42.659 --> 02:36:44.528
PLACES WE MOST WANT THEM TO. WE

02:36:44.595 --> 02:36:45.863
THOUGHT A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY TO

02:36:45.929 --> 02:36:47.464
BEGINNING WAS IMPORTANT. BUT

02:36:47.531 --> 02:36:49.032
OVER TIME I THINK THE SCIENCE

02:36:49.099 --> 02:36:51.168
AND EVIDENCE A SHOWN. I AREAS

02:36:51.235 --> 02:36:52.236
LIKE THEIR HEALTHCARE AND

I THINK OF THE HIGH COST IT

02:38:17.588 --> 02:38:19.022
SEEMS TO BE RATHER SUSTAIN AND

02:38:19.089 --> 02:38:20.057

THAT- WE DO. THINK THAT- IT'S

02:38:50.854 --> 02:38:52.289
REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE ALL

02:38:52.356 --> 02:38:54.057
THE DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE

02:38:54.124 --> 02:38:56.159
PIPE UNDERNEATH THIS TENT I'M-

02:38:56.226 --> 02:38:57.427

02:38:57.494 --> 02:38:58.295
SOMETHING THAT. IN THE IN THE

02:38:58.362 --> 02:39:02.332
LEGISLATION- THE PHARMACEUTICAL

02:39:02.399 --> 02:39:03.867

THE END. SO CHAIN FROM THE MAN.

02:39:13.243 --> 02:39:15.445
TO THE PD. TO WHOLESALE. WE

02:39:15.512 --> 02:39:16.780
REALLY SUFFER FROM A LACK OF

02:39:16.847 --> 02:39:17.714
TRANSPARENCY ACROSS THAT

02:39:17.781 --> 02:39:21.752

SOMETHING THAT WASN'T

02:39:35.532 --> 02:39:37.701
NECESSARILY ON OUR RADAR TWO

02:39:37.768 --> 02:39:39.336
THOUSAND ALTHOUGH IT'S VERY

02:39:39.403 --> 02:39:40.137

02:39:40.203 --> 02:39:42.439
IS A WE MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF

02:39:42.506 --> 02:39:44.107
THESE DIFFERENT IMPORTANT

02:39:44.174 --> 02:39:45.976
SEGMENTS OF THE BY ARE BEING

02:39:46.043 --> 02:39:49.079
HELD TO. THE SAME STANDARD TIME

02:39:49.146 --> 02:39:50.847
PARENTS CANNOT BE. AND HOW TO

02:39:50.914 --> 02:39:52.316

02:39:52.382 --> 02:39:54.651
YEAH ONE PIECE IS GOING IN COME.

02:39:54.718 --> 02:39:56.386
FROM DIRECT. WE'RE NOT BE

02:39:56.453 --> 02:39:58.255
SUCCESSFUL. BUT WE DON'T BOUNCE

02:39:58.322 --> 02:40:02.993
WAY BECAUSE ONE. NATION ME THAT

02:40:03.060 --> 02:40:06.697
BY BEING. AND I'M SIXTY. EIGHT

02:40:06.763 --> 02:40:09.666
MEN OUT ARE WASTED. ABOUT THAT

02:40:09.733 --> 02:40:11.768
YOU CAN ACHIEVE MORE GOALS.

02:40:11.835 --> 02:40:14.838
THANK YOU FIX MUCH. SO JEREMY.

DO YOU SEE IF YOU SEEN SOME OF

02:40:16.406 --> 02:40:24.915
THE. OUR NATION'S. IN YOUR THAT

02:40:24.982 --> 02:40:26.917
HAVE LED TO. THE MAIN YOUR YOUR

02:40:26.984 --> 02:40:30.087
CAR OF. OR YOU KNOW YOU GROWTH

02:40:30.153 --> 02:40:31.989
RATE WAS CERTAIN HI THAN CAL.

02:40:32.055 --> 02:40:33.023
SO WHAT IT WHAT WILL WHAT WAS

02:40:33.090 --> 02:40:34.691
FUELING WAS FEW THAT AND AGAIN

02:40:34.758 --> 02:40:36.293

THINK LOOK AT THAT TWO THOUSAND

02:40:44.067 --> 02:40:45.802
TO TWENTY. DID THIS DESTROY IS

02:40:45.869 --> 02:40:46.837
WITHOUT A COST GROWTH TARGET

02:40:46.903 --> 02:40:48.005
PROGRAM WE'RE COLLECTING MORE

02:40:48.071 --> 02:40:49.606
DETAILED DATA WE DON'T KNOW

02:40:49.673 --> 02:40:51.408
EXACTLY WHAT WAS FEELING THAT-

02:40:51.475 --> 02:40:53.310
AND SO ARE OUR HOPE IS THAT

02:40:53.377 --> 02:40:54.244
GOING FORWARD WE WILL

02:40:54.311 --> 02:40:55.746
UNDERSTAND YEAR AFTER YEAR-

02:40:55.812 --> 02:40:58.015
WHAT IS WHAT IS. REALLY PART OF

02:40:58.081 --> 02:40:59.449
THAT RIGHT NOW SIX AND A HALF

02:40:59.516 --> 02:41:01.818
PERCENT OF. THREE POINT 4% OR

02:41:01.885 --> 02:41:03.587
LESS GOING FORWARD WHAT IT

02:41:03.653 --> 02:41:04.621
REALLY IS UNDERNEATH THAT THE

02:41:04.688 --> 02:41:08.058
HOOD THERE- AT. WE HAVE A WE DO

02:41:08.125 --> 02:41:10.227
HAVE A FAIRLY HIGH- THE

02:41:10.293 --> 02:41:12.763
CONSOLIDATED MARKET- YOU KNOW I

02:41:12.829 --> 02:41:14.231
THINK. IT'S BEEN LEFT IT'S LESS

02:41:14.297 --> 02:41:15.499
SO THAT IT'S OCCURRED IN THE

02:41:15.565 --> 02:41:17.634
LAST FEW YEARS AND MORE SO

02:41:17.701 --> 02:41:20.604
HAPPENED BEFORE- BEFORE THAT-

02:41:20.670 --> 02:41:21.605
WE- WE DEFINITELY SEEN SOME

02:41:21.671 --> 02:41:24.074
CONSOLIDATE AND WE STILL HAVE-

02:41:24.141 --> 02:41:25.976
YOU KNOW. IT IT'S A LITTLE IT'S

02:41:26.043 --> 02:41:27.411
A LITTLE HARD TO COMPARE ITSELF

02:41:27.477 --> 02:41:28.478
NATIONALLY BECAUSE LIKE

02:41:28.545 --> 02:41:30.013
EVERYTHING'S CONSOLIDATED. SO

02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:31.281
WHAT LEVEL OF EXTREME

02:41:31.348 --> 02:41:34.117
CONSOLIDATION ARE YOU- SO WE'RE

02:41:34.184 --> 02:41:35.786
NOT AS EXTREMELY CONSOLIDATED

02:41:35.852 --> 02:41:37.154
IN THE PORTLAND AREA AS MAYBE

02:41:37.220 --> 02:41:38.488
SOME OTHER PLACES BUT WORSE

02:41:38.555 --> 02:41:39.823
THAN SOME OTHERS. BUT OUTSIDE

02:41:39.890 --> 02:41:41.191
THE PORTLAND AREA LARGELY IT'S

02:41:41.258 --> 02:41:43.527
ONE. HOSPITAL COMMUNITIES AND

02:41:43.593 --> 02:41:44.728
IN A LOT OF THOSE COMMUNITIES

02:41:44.795 --> 02:41:47.130
THEY HAVE ACQUIRED- THE LOCAL

02:41:47.197 --> 02:41:49.299
PROVIDER GROUP- AND SO THEY DO

02:41:49.366 --> 02:41:51.268
OPERATE IN LARGE PART. AND IT

02:41:51.334 --> 02:41:52.669
IS NOT UNIVERSAL THAN A LARGE

02:41:52.736 --> 02:41:56.039
PARTS OF THIS. IS A HEALTH. HAS

02:41:56.106 --> 02:41:57.274
AS MEDICAL GROUP IN THE AND THE

02:41:57.340 --> 02:41:59.810
X. SEVERAL HOSP IT.

02:41:59.876 --> 02:42:03.513
INDEPENDENCE RIGHT AREAS SO I.

02:42:03.580 --> 02:42:06.283
HAVEN'T SEEN AS MUCH OF A

02:42:06.349 --> 02:42:09.653
SELECTION AND WE'LL SEE YOU.

02:42:09.719 --> 02:42:12.622
I'M IT. STARTED CONSOLIDATED

02:42:12.689 --> 02:42:15.125
ESPECIALLY OUTSIDE. SO YOU

02:42:15.192 --> 02:42:17.694
DON'T SEE THIS IN OF CARE IN

02:42:17.761 --> 02:42:20.097
RURAL FOR LARGE WE ASK DO WE

02:42:20.163 --> 02:42:21.465
ASK DO PRICE ANNIE THIS IS

02:42:21.531 --> 02:42:22.432
WHERE WITHOUT PROBABLY THE OF

02:42:22.499 --> 02:42:24.868
AT OCCURRED IF I'M WRONG PRICES

02:42:24.935 --> 02:42:26.036
ARE LOW LOWER IN THE PORTLAND

02:42:26.103 --> 02:42:26.636
AREA WHERE WE DO HAVE

02:42:26.703 --> 02:42:28.638
COMPETITION- AND THEY GET

02:42:28.705 --> 02:42:29.773
HIGHER AND HIGHER AS YOU GET

02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:30.807
FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM

02:42:30.874 --> 02:42:31.808
THE PORTLAND AREA TO RURAL

02:42:31.875 --> 02:42:33.310
COMMUNITIES SO THAT THE COSTS

02:42:33.376 --> 02:42:34.978
ARE DEFINITELY HIGHER AND THE

02:42:35.045 --> 02:42:36.746
RURAL COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW AND

02:42:36.813 --> 02:42:37.948
SOME OF THAT IS. YOU KNOW

02:42:38.014 --> 02:42:39.349
SERVICE DELIVERY IS MORE

02:42:39.416 --> 02:42:40.851
EXPENSIVE IN SOME PARTS OF THIS

02:42:40.917 --> 02:42:41.952
COMMUNITY SO WE HAVEN'T REALLY

02:42:42.018 --> 02:42:43.120
LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD TO SAY

02:42:43.186 --> 02:42:45.589
WHY EXACTLY BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE

02:42:45.655 --> 02:42:47.023
EVERYBODY SORT OF STARTING FROM

02:42:47.090 --> 02:42:49.493
A DIFFERENT POINT- BUT GOING

02:42:49.559 --> 02:42:51.061
FORWARD EVERY THE IDEAS OF WHAT

02:42:51.128 --> 02:42:52.829
HE'S GONNA BE HELD AT THE SAME

02:42:52.896 --> 02:42:54.631
TARGET AND THAT WE THEN

02:42:54.698 --> 02:42:55.632
UNDERSTAND MORE AND MORE OVER

02:42:55.699 --> 02:42:57.701
TIME WHAT DRIVERS UNDER THE

02:42:57.767 --> 02:42:58.902
HOOD SO WE CAN EVALUATE MORE

02:42:58.969 --> 02:43:00.103
POLICY OPTIONS POTENTIALLY FOR

02:43:00.170 --> 02:43:02.739
WHAT WE DO COLLECTIVELY TO GET

02:43:02.806 --> 02:43:05.175
THAT THOSE COSTS- AND I WILL

02:43:05.242 --> 02:43:07.310
JUST SAY I THINK. THAT IS AN

02:43:07.377 --> 02:43:09.346
AREA WE HAVE TO IS THE UNITY OF

02:43:09.412 --> 02:43:11.414
THE HAS GOT SO WE'RE GONNA I

02:43:11.481 --> 02:43:13.617
HIGHLY ANTICIPATED WILL MAKING

02:43:13.683 --> 02:43:15.986
SURE WE ARE READING ABOUT ANY

02:43:16.052 --> 02:43:17.521
SORT OF AN INTENT TO QUINCY

02:43:17.587 --> 02:43:19.256
LAND ROLE COMMUNITY- ME WE'VE

02:43:19.322 --> 02:43:22.659
GOT VERY HERE PARTS OF THE

02:43:22.726 --> 02:43:31.501
STATE- FOLKS. YOU'VE GOT PARTS

02:43:31.568 --> 02:43:32.269
OF CALIFORNIA SIMILAR THE RHINO

02:43:32.335 --> 02:43:34.704
VERY FROM AND SO THE MARKET DAM

02:43:34.771 --> 02:43:35.338
ARE JUST VERY DIFFERENT THAN IN

02:43:35.405 --> 02:43:36.606
THE POOR AREA SO ONE OF THE ONE

02:43:36.673 --> 02:43:38.742
OF THE REASONS WE LIKE THIS

02:43:38.808 --> 02:43:40.610
GROWTH TARGET A PRO IS IT IS

02:43:40.677 --> 02:43:41.845
RECOGNIZE EACH COMMUNITIES

02:43:41.912 --> 02:43:43.380
COMING TO THE TABLES WITH A

02:43:43.446 --> 02:43:44.581
SORT OF DIFFERENT SET OF

02:43:44.648 --> 02:43:46.783
DYNAMICS HAVE YOU KNOW THAT

02:43:46.850 --> 02:43:48.151
MAKE IT TO THEIR AFFILIATED

02:43:48.218 --> 02:43:50.320
WITH SOME HAVE SIGNIFICANT

02:43:50.387 --> 02:43:51.821
PROVIDER SHORTAGES AND ALL OF

02:43:51.888 --> 02:43:52.656
THEM HAVE PROVIDER CHALLENGES

02:43:52.722 --> 02:43:54.724
BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ANSWER THE

02:43:54.791 --> 02:43:55.725
SAME IN EVERY COMMUNITY SO

02:43:55.792 --> 02:43:56.927
RECOGNIZE AND EVERYBODY'S

02:43:56.993 --> 02:43:58.528
DIFFERENT SET OF CONTACTS AND

02:43:58.595 --> 02:44:01.198
CIRCUMSTANCES. WILL NOT GET IN

02:44:01.264 --> 02:44:03.967
THE WAY OF THE WORLD COMMITTED

02:44:04.034 --> 02:44:05.402
TO A GOAL RIGHT WE'VE GOT A

02:44:05.468 --> 02:44:06.703
REDUCED THE RATE OF GROWTH AND

02:44:06.770 --> 02:44:09.105
READ THE THERE DIFFERENT

02:44:09.172 --> 02:44:10.807
CHALLENGE COMMUNITY AND IT'S

02:44:10.874 --> 02:44:13.443
ALSO. GET THEIR ARE YOU CAN GET

02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:20.250
THERE BY PRICES YOU GET THEIR I.

02:44:20.317 --> 02:44:23.119
VALLEY AND TRY. THINGS YOU FOR

02:44:23.186 --> 02:44:26.456
THE US. I WOULD JUST THAT I

02:44:26.523 --> 02:44:27.457
THINK ONE OF THE YOU KNOW ONE

02:44:27.524 --> 02:44:29.693
THAT. THE BENCHMARK THE GO

02:44:29.759 --> 02:44:30.827
MENTAL PRESENTS IS THAT THERE

02:44:30.894 --> 02:44:31.861
IS ENOUGH MONEY PLAYING FIELD

02:44:31.928 --> 02:44:33.129
TO BE WITH THAT DIFFERENT

02:44:33.196 --> 02:44:33.730
PROVIDERS ARE PAID DIFFERENTLY

02:44:33.797 --> 02:44:34.931
FOR PROVIDING THE EXACT SAME

02:44:34.998 --> 02:44:36.333
TYPES OF SERVICES SIMILAR TYPES

02:44:36.399 --> 02:44:37.834
OF PATIENTS. AND A LOT OF THAT

02:44:37.901 --> 02:44:40.070
VARIATION IS DRIVEN BY THEIR

02:44:40.136 --> 02:44:43.640
MARKET LEVERAGE. SO ONE OF THE

02:44:43.707 --> 02:44:45.575
WAYS THAT WE'VE WE'VE SOUGHT TO

02:44:45.642 --> 02:44:47.010
ADDRESS THIS THOUGH. IS THAT

02:44:47.077 --> 02:44:48.511
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING WHEN WE'RE

02:44:48.578 --> 02:44:50.146
AT THE KIND OF THE- ENFORCEMENT

02:44:50.213 --> 02:44:51.615
STAGE WHEN WE'RE CONSIDERING AN

02:44:51.681 --> 02:44:54.117
ENTITY. FOR OP PERFORMANCE

02:44:54.184 --> 02:44:56.519
IMPROVEMENT PLAN WE REALLY LOOK

02:44:56.586 --> 02:44:58.455
AT THAT THE HOLD. SIR CONTACTS

02:44:58.521 --> 02:45:00.857
OF THAT ORGAN XIN. AND SO YOU

02:45:00.924 --> 02:45:01.858
COULD SEE IT WE HAVE HAD

02:45:01.925 --> 02:45:04.060
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE YOU KNOW IF

02:45:04.127 --> 02:45:05.061
THIS IS A HISTORICALLY LIKE

02:45:05.128 --> 02:45:08.031
VERY LOW PRICED PROVIDER. THAT

02:45:08.098 --> 02:45:09.532
TREATS YOU KNOW A LOT OF PUBLIC

02:45:09.599 --> 02:45:10.900
PATIENTS IN IN A REALLY

02:45:10.967 --> 02:45:12.736
VULNERABLE PART OF OUR STATE.

02:45:12.802 --> 02:45:14.137
AND THEIR COST GROWTH WAS FOUR

02:45:14.204 --> 02:45:15.805
PERCENT. WE MAY THINK VERY

02:45:15.872 --> 02:45:17.540
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THAT PROVIDER

02:45:17.607 --> 02:45:18.908
THAN HISTORICALLY VERY HIGH

02:45:18.975 --> 02:45:20.510
PRICE PROVIDER THAT- ONLY

02:45:20.577 --> 02:45:22.946
TREATS COMMERCIAL PATIENTS AND

02:45:23.013 --> 02:45:25.382
WAS YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW. DOING

02:45:25.448 --> 02:45:28.318
EXCESSIVE MANAGING ADJUSTING

02:45:28.385 --> 02:45:30.553
I'M I'M I'M KIND OF. USE A

02:45:30.620 --> 02:45:31.788
HYPOTHETICAL HERE BUT THE

02:45:31.855 --> 02:45:33.523
CONTEXT HOURS HERE AND SO ARE

02:45:33.590 --> 02:45:34.824
THOSE ARE FACTORED THAT CAN.

02:45:34.891 --> 02:45:36.359
BEAR INTO THE JUST OF WHETHER A

02:45:36.426 --> 02:45:38.194
PERFORMANCE IN PLAN. IS

02:45:38.261 --> 02:45:39.863
WARRANTED OR NOT IT'S NOT A

02:45:39.929 --> 02:45:41.798
CLEAR FORMULA THAT JUST SAYS AX

02:45:41.865 --> 02:45:43.700
PLUS WHITE WE'LL SEE. YOU TAKE

02:45:43.767 --> 02:45:44.701
INTO ACCOUNT WHAT ARE THESE

02:45:44.768 --> 02:45:45.502
ORGANIZATIONS WHERE THEY

02:45:45.568 --> 02:45:46.936
SITUATE WHAT POPULATIONS TODAY

02:45:47.003 --> 02:45:49.372
SIR WHAT ARE THEY DOING AND-

02:45:49.439 --> 02:45:50.707
HOW THEY MAY PASSED INVESTMENTS

02:45:50.774 --> 02:45:52.342
AND ALL THIS CAN GO INTO KIND

02:45:52.409 --> 02:45:54.511
OF THIS THIS KIND OF REVIEW.

02:45:54.577 --> 02:45:57.747
AND AS I SAID- EVEN HAVING

02:45:57.814 --> 02:45:58.682
THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:45:58.748 --> 02:46:01.751
ENTITIES WITH PROVIDERS- CAN

02:46:01.818 --> 02:46:03.053
CHANGE BEHAVIOR IN AND OF

02:46:03.119 --> 02:46:04.721
ITSELF- BECAUSE THEY SAY THAT'S

02:46:04.788 --> 02:46:06.189
A THAT'S AN INTERESTING I NEVER

02:46:06.256 --> 02:46:07.257
REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT. LOOKING

02:46:07.324 --> 02:46:09.159
AT MY OWN ORGANIZATION THAT WAY

02:46:09.225 --> 02:46:10.794
I CAN SEE WHERE THAT MIGHT BE.

02:46:10.860 --> 02:46:13.897
WHAT YOU KNOW TROUBLING- IN

02:46:13.963 --> 02:46:14.464
TERMS OF THE GREATER GOAL OF

02:46:14.531 --> 02:46:16.299
MEETING THE BENCHMARK AND SO. I

02:46:16.366 --> 02:46:18.768
GET WHETHER YOU BUILD THAT AND

02:46:18.835 --> 02:46:20.036
KIND OF THE OUTSIDER WHERE YOU

02:46:20.103 --> 02:46:21.971
HAVE AN OF THE FOOT. IN REVIEW

02:46:22.038 --> 02:46:23.406
IN THE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES

02:46:23.473 --> 02:46:24.874
YOU WANT YOU WANT TO BRING IT

02:46:24.941 --> 02:46:26.276
BACK THAT CONTEXTUAL

02:46:26.343 --> 02:46:29.913
INFORMATION. BECAUSE WE DO

02:46:29.979 --> 02:46:33.216
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. SO

02:46:33.283 --> 02:46:34.117
MASSACHUSETTS IS A IS A

02:46:34.184 --> 02:46:35.352
INDEPENDENT AND ORGANISE UNDER

02:46:35.418 --> 02:46:39.823
THE OREGON HEALTH AUTHORITY

02:46:39.889 --> 02:46:41.257
MARYLAND AND DELAWARE ARE

02:46:41.324 --> 02:46:43.860
COMING. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

02:46:43.927 --> 02:46:49.799
THEREUNDER SO. SO THREE THREE

02:46:49.866 --> 02:46:52.102
TO ONE HERE- ON THAT SO I BUT I

02:46:52.168 --> 02:46:54.304
YOU KNOW I I'M CURIOUS I'M

02:46:54.371 --> 02:46:56.806
CURIOUS- BUT PERSONALLY I WILL

02:46:56.873 --> 02:46:58.375
I WILL SAY I HAVE A BIAS I'M

02:46:58.441 --> 02:46:59.542
AYE I WOULD PREFER TO SEE AN

02:46:59.609 --> 02:47:02.045
INDEPENDENT ENTITY- I THINK IT

02:47:02.112 --> 02:47:03.880
WOULD BE IT KEEPS THE POLITICS

02:47:03.947 --> 02:47:05.348
OUT OF IT- ULTIMATELY

02:47:05.415 --> 02:47:06.883
RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAVE AN LA-

02:47:06.950 --> 02:47:08.551
WE HAVE A RIDE WHICH ARE NON

02:47:08.618 --> 02:47:11.354
PARTISAN- BUT THAT'S YOU KNOW

02:47:11.421 --> 02:47:12.389
THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S A THAT'S A

02:47:12.455 --> 02:47:15.492
PERSONAL PERSONAL BIAS- IS OR

02:47:15.558 --> 02:47:17.827
AGAIN. HARD FAST ON ON STATE

02:47:17.894 --> 02:47:19.596
WITH THEIR OR IS IT JUST IT

02:47:19.662 --> 02:47:20.930
JUST THE WAY OUR SYSTEM WORKS-

02:47:20.997 --> 02:47:22.699
THE AT THE WAY THE LEGISLATION

02:47:22.766 --> 02:47:23.733
IS RIGHT NOW ISN'T IT SAYS IT

02:47:23.800 --> 02:47:25.135
WILL BE RUN BY- HA IN

02:47:25.201 --> 02:47:27.303
COLLABORATION WITH- WITH THE C.

02:47:27.370 --> 02:47:28.705
B. S. A SEPARATE AGENCY THAT

02:47:28.772 --> 02:47:30.573
DOES OUR INSURANCE REGULATION-

02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:32.008
AND WITH OVERSIGHT FROM THIS.

02:47:32.075 --> 02:47:33.476
THIS BOARD WHICH IS A GOVERNOR

02:47:33.543 --> 02:47:35.512
APPOINTED- BUT IS- CITIZEN

02:47:35.578 --> 02:47:37.347
BOARD THAT'S THAT'S LAID OFF

02:47:37.414 --> 02:47:39.015
WITH INDEPENDENT- AND SINCE

02:47:39.082 --> 02:47:39.949
THEY ARE. EMPLOYEES OF THE

02:47:40.016 --> 02:47:42.152
AGENCY- IT'S THAT'S A LOS THAT

02:47:42.218 --> 02:47:43.453
LEGISLATION RIGHT NOW IN THE IN

02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:44.687
THE GROUP DOES HAVE TO COME UP

02:47:44.754 --> 02:47:45.822
WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS OF

02:47:45.889 --> 02:47:46.990
THEIR SUMMERS MAYBE THEY COME

02:47:47.056 --> 02:47:48.291
BACK WITH SOMETHING. DIFFERENT

02:47:48.358 --> 02:47:50.727
THAN THAT BUT I THINK THERE'S

02:47:50.794 --> 02:47:51.928
ALSO THE CHALLENGE OF WE'VE

02:47:51.995 --> 02:47:53.463
CONSOLIDATE EVERYTHING UNDER

02:47:53.530 --> 02:47:54.297
ONE AGENCY IF WE START

02:47:54.364 --> 02:47:55.832
SPLITTING STUFF APART THEN

02:47:55.899 --> 02:47:57.834
THERE'S PROBABLY F. ACOSTA THAT

02:47:57.901 --> 02:47:59.202
AS WELL RIGHT SO WE'VE GOT ALL

02:47:59.269 --> 02:48:01.471
OF A LOT OF THE DATA. ALREADY

02:48:01.538 --> 02:48:03.373
IN HOUSE WITHIN THE AGENCY- I

02:48:03.440 --> 02:48:05.008
ACTUALLY THIS IS A OPPORTUNITY

02:48:05.074 --> 02:48:07.076
REALLY BUILT OF THAT AND DO

02:48:07.143 --> 02:48:09.045
MORE WITH- AND SO I THINK THERE

02:48:09.112 --> 02:48:10.880
WOULD BE A RISK OF A- SHOULD

02:48:10.947 --> 02:48:12.449
SAY WITH. STATE INTO SEPARATE

02:48:12.515 --> 02:48:13.817
AGENCY BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE I

02:48:13.883 --> 02:48:17.353
CAN ALSO SEE THE VALUE AND- AND

02:48:17.420 --> 02:48:19.088
REALLY HAPPENED SOMEBODY WHO'S

02:48:19.155 --> 02:48:20.023
COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT FROM.

02:48:20.089 --> 02:48:20.990
YOU KNOW HAVING OPERATE THE

02:48:21.057 --> 02:48:22.792
PROGRAM WHICH HAS ITS OWN

02:48:22.859 --> 02:48:24.861
SEPARATE SET OF CHALLENGES- SO

02:48:24.928 --> 02:48:25.895
I YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S PROS

02:48:25.962 --> 02:48:28.164
AND CONS- EITHER WAY IT JUST

02:48:28.231 --> 02:48:29.299
HAPPENS THAT IN OREGON WE FOR A

02:48:29.365 --> 02:48:31.034
SORT OF CONSOLIDATE ALL THE

02:48:31.100 --> 02:48:32.268
PROGRAMS AND SO. THE STARTING

02:48:32.335 --> 02:48:33.870
POINT FOR THE CONVERSATION HAD.

02:48:33.937 --> 02:48:36.005
JACKSON BLESSING WHAT'S

02:48:36.072 --> 02:48:37.006
INCLUDED THERE. THE THOUGHTS ON

02:48:37.073 --> 02:48:43.980
THAT ONE. YEAH ONE UP IS A YOU

02:48:44.047 --> 02:48:44.614
HAVE A GOVERNMENT AID. BUT THE

02:48:44.681 --> 02:48:47.650
YOU HAVE IN. COME RIGHT WHO ARE

02:48:47.717 --> 02:48:49.953
MAYBE NOT SO. YOU KNOW KIND OF

02:48:50.019 --> 02:48:51.087
LIKE A MIXED WHERE YOU KNOW YOU

02:48:51.154 --> 02:48:52.522
YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE COMING IS

02:48:52.589 --> 02:48:55.959
ALL THESE INDEPENDENT EXPERTS-

02:48:56.025 --> 02:48:56.793
BUT ARE NOT PART OF THE

02:48:56.860 --> 02:49:00.430
INDUSTRY- SO THAT WAY YOU KIND

02:49:00.497 --> 02:49:03.066
OF. HAVE BOTH. YEAH I THINK

02:49:03.132 --> 02:49:04.801
THERE'S YOU KNOW TO BE CLEAR

02:49:04.868 --> 02:49:07.036
WORK GOVERNMENT AGENCY- SO I

02:49:07.103 --> 02:49:08.471
THINK THERE'S- DIFFERENT

02:49:08.538 --> 02:49:12.008
FLAVORS OF THE SAME THING HERE-

02:49:12.075 --> 02:49:13.276
YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW

02:49:13.343 --> 02:49:16.145
ONE OF THE KIND OF- STRAIGHT

02:49:16.212 --> 02:49:17.413
FROM OUR FROM WHAT WE'VE DONE

02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:20.083
IS. AS GLENN SAID OUR

02:49:20.149 --> 02:49:20.850
COMMISSIONERS HAVE THIS

02:49:20.917 --> 02:49:23.186
CONFLICT OF INTEREST SO ON THE

02:49:23.253 --> 02:49:25.788
BOARD MEMBERS ARE REALLY THERE-

02:49:25.855 --> 02:49:27.824
NOT TO DRIVE THEIR OWN PERSONAL

02:49:27.891 --> 02:49:29.759
AGENDAS NOT TO DRIVE AN AGENDA

02:49:29.826 --> 02:49:30.426
OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT'S

02:49:30.493 --> 02:49:32.495
THAT'S FINE AND- REALLY THEY'RE

02:49:32.562 --> 02:49:34.297
JUST. HOW CAN WE BE A PART OF

02:49:34.364 --> 02:49:37.066
THIS BOARD AND IMPROVE CARE FOR

02:49:37.133 --> 02:49:39.969
THE PUBLIC OF THE OF THE STATE

02:49:40.036 --> 02:49:42.305
AND REALLY BRING THAT NOT LENDS

02:49:42.372 --> 02:49:43.640
TO IT AND I'M A HAPPY. ON THERE

02:49:43.706 --> 02:49:49.045

HAVING OF A BOARD THIS. IS IT

02:49:50.847 --> 02:49:51.414
ALL IS JUST ON WAY OF A

02:49:51.481 --> 02:49:52.115
BUILDING TRANSPARENCY AND-

02:49:52.181 --> 02:49:53.650
TRUST BECAUSE- PEOPLE WE ALL OF

02:49:53.716 --> 02:49:56.486
OUR WERE MEANS ARE PUBLIC AND

02:49:56.553 --> 02:49:57.820

AND I THINK THAT ACTUALLY.

02:50:04.594 --> 02:50:06.796
ENGENDERS AN ABILITY TO SAY- I

02:50:06.863 --> 02:50:07.764

02:50:07.830 --> 02:50:09.332
STRUGGLING WITH DIFFICULT

02:50:09.399 --> 02:50:11.134
DECISIONS AND THAT THIS IS NOT

02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:12.402
SOME TYPE OF LIKE. IT'S ALL

02:50:12.468 --> 02:50:13.469
KIND OF PRE ARRANGED IN SOME

02:50:13.536 --> 02:50:15.238
PRE ROOM AND THEN COME OUT LIKE

02:50:15.305 --> 02:50:17.407
THIS IS A REAL TIME INACTION

02:50:17.473 --> 02:50:18.875
KIND OF LIKE. YOU KNOW HOW TO

DINNER. AT THAT AGENCY- WE'VE

02:50:28.585 --> 02:50:30.987
PROBABLY AVERAGE. I DO THE MATH

BECAUSE TO STUDY THESE

02:53:29.632 --> 02:53:32.435
PROBLEMS- IT'S CRITICAL TO BE

THAT CONTAIN PROVIDERS IN THE

02:53:49.152 --> 02:53:50.586
ABILITY TO TRACK THOSE

02:53:57.460 --> 02:54:01.964
INFORMATION AS REPORTED IN TWO

02:54:02.031 --> 02:54:06.002
A CENTRAL REPOSITORY UP. TO RUN

02:54:06.068 --> 02:54:10.573
A STATE. SO CURRENTLY THERE ARE

02:54:10.640 --> 02:54:11.641
SEVENTEEN STATES HAVE ALL HERE

02:54:11.707 --> 02:54:14.010
BECAUSE DATA IS AND OR IN THE

02:54:14.076 --> 02:54:16.712
OF AND THEM AND- CAL. THE RE

02:54:16.779 --> 02:54:18.581

FORMING AT ALL PAYER CLAIMS

DATABASE SEES IS THAT MANY OF

02:54:23.085 --> 02:54:25.321
THE DAY YOU THAT- DIFFERENT

02:54:25.388 --> 02:54:26.522
ENTITIES HAVE USED

02:54:26.589 --> 02:54:29.225
HISTORICALLY. I HAVE RELIED ON

02:54:29.292 --> 02:54:31.928
WHAT  CALL- PRIVATE POOLING OF

02:54:31.994 --> 02:54:33.830
DATA- SO THERE ARE THESE

02:54:33.896 --> 02:54:36.532
PRIVATE FIRMS OUT THERE WHO

02:54:36.599 --> 02:54:37.400
MAYBE HAVE AMASSED A PRIVATE

02:54:37.466 --> 02:54:40.703
CLAIMS DATA- OR- PEOPLE HAVE

02:54:40.770 --> 02:54:43.105
ACCESS MEDICARE DATA BUT-

02:54:43.172 --> 02:54:44.707
FREQUENTLY WHEN ONE LOOKS AT

02:54:44.774 --> 02:54:46.242
THOSE DATA YOU'RE LOOKING WITH

02:54:46.309 --> 02:54:48.845
IN SILOS AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE

02:54:48.911 --> 02:54:50.546
ABILITY TO LOOK ACROSS THE

02:54:50.613 --> 02:54:52.415
OTHER ISSUE WITH- SOME OF THESE

02:54:52.481 --> 02:54:54.483
VOLUNTARY REPORTING EFFORTS IS

02:54:54.550 --> 02:54:55.952
THAT. TYPICALLY THEY ONLY

02:54:56.018 --> 02:54:57.720
INCLUDE TO UPDATE ON A LIMITED

02:54:57.787 --> 02:54:59.422
NUMBER OF SUBMITTERS AND THEY

02:54:59.488 --> 02:55:00.790
OFTEN RESTRICT AT USE OF THE

02:55:00.857 --> 02:55:05.294
DATA SO ALL HERE CLAIMS

02:55:05.361 --> 02:55:07.396
DATABASE SEIZE REALLY TRY TO

02:55:07.463 --> 02:55:08.564
MOVE BEYOND SOME OF THESE

02:55:08.631 --> 02:55:10.566
UNDERLYING PROBLEMS BY HAVING

02:55:10.633 --> 02:55:12.435
DATA FROM MOST OR ALL OF THE

02:55:12.501 --> 02:55:15.304
STATE'S INSURERS AND THEY ALSO

02:55:15.371 --> 02:55:16.772
HAVE THE BENEFIT OF MOVING

02:55:16.839 --> 02:55:18.441
BEYOND SOME OF THE CURRENT

02:55:18.507 --> 02:55:19.742
EFFORTS THAT EXIST I

02:55:19.809 --> 02:55:21.510
CALIFORNIA SUCH AS WITH OSCAR

02:55:21.577 --> 02:55:23.279
COLLECTING DATA ON HOSPITAL

02:55:23.346 --> 02:55:25.681
DISCHARGES- BY. INCLUDING THE

02:55:25.748 --> 02:55:27.583
CARE THAT'S PROVIDED ACROSS ALL

02:55:27.650 --> 02:55:30.386
SITES OF CARE- RATHER THAN JUST

02:55:30.453 --> 02:55:33.422
HOSPITALIZATIONS AND ANOTHER

02:55:33.489 --> 02:55:35.758
BENEFIT IS THAT- THEY TYPICALLY

02:55:35.825 --> 02:55:38.194
HAVE MUCH LARGER SAMPLE SIZES

02:55:38.261 --> 02:55:41.030
SO- WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT IS

02:55:41.097 --> 02:55:42.365
THAT WHEN YOU'RE DEVELOPING

02:55:42.431 --> 02:55:45.001
ESTIMATES OF A PROVIDERS- LET'S

02:55:45.067 --> 02:55:47.303
SAY QUALITY PERFORMANCE- YOU

02:55:47.370 --> 02:55:48.738
NEED TO HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER

02:55:48.804 --> 02:55:51.407
OF OBSERVATIONS TO BE ABLE TO

02:55:51.474 --> 02:55:52.541
GET A RELIABLE ESTIMATE- AND

02:55:52.608 --> 02:55:55.912
SO. LARGER SAMPLES ENABLE THAT-

02:55:55.978 --> 02:55:57.346
THEY ALSO HAVE BROADER

02:55:57.413 --> 02:55:59.348
GEOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATION AND

02:55:59.415 --> 02:56:00.716
THE OTHER THING THAT'S CRITICAL

02:56:00.783 --> 02:56:02.051
AS WE TRY TO THINK ABOUT

02:56:02.118 --> 02:56:03.786
MEASURING COST TRENDS AND

02:56:03.853 --> 02:56:05.388
CHANGES OVER TIME IS THE

02:56:05.454 --> 02:56:07.223
ABILITY TO HAVE LONGITUDINAL

02:56:07.290 --> 02:56:09.325
INFORMATION- ON BOTH

02:56:09.392 --> 02:56:11.494
INDIVIDUALS AND PROVIDERS-

02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:13.062
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE HEALTH

02:56:13.129 --> 02:56:14.597
CARE MARKET PLACE IS VERY

02:56:14.664 --> 02:56:16.832
DYNAMIC- PEOPLE SWITCH HEALTH

02:56:16.899 --> 02:56:19.368
PLANS THEY SWITCH PROVIDERS.

02:56:19.435 --> 02:56:20.002
AND THE ABILITY TO TRACK THEM

02:56:20.069 --> 02:56:21.704
OVER TIME AND UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:56:21.771 --> 02:56:23.706
HAPPENS TO THEM AS A FUNCTION

02:56:23.773 --> 02:56:25.441
OF THOSE SWITCHES IS ALSO

02:56:25.508 --> 02:56:27.944
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. SO I

02:56:28.010 --> 02:56:29.745
THINK ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT

02:56:29.812 --> 02:56:31.247
CALIFORNIA'S MOVING DOWN THE

02:56:31.314 --> 02:56:33.849
PATH- AS A FUNCTION OF AB

02:56:33.916 --> 02:56:36.919
EIGHTEEN TEN- AB EIGHTEEN TEN

02:56:36.986 --> 02:56:38.754
ESTABLISHED- THE HEALTH CARE

02:56:38.821 --> 02:56:41.123
COSTS. TRANSPARENCY DATABASE

02:56:41.190 --> 02:56:42.291
THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE

02:56:42.358 --> 02:56:45.795
OPERATIONAL BY JULY ONE OF

02:56:45.861 --> 02:56:46.362
TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THE

02:56:46.429 --> 02:56:49.198
GOAL IS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION

02:56:49.265 --> 02:56:51.500
TO INFORM POLICY DECISIONS

02:56:51.567 --> 02:56:54.270
REGARDING- HEALTH CARE COSTS-

02:56:54.337 --> 02:56:56.005
THE ABILITY TO. BETTER

02:56:56.072 --> 02:56:57.940
UNDERSTAND AND REDUCE- HEALTH

02:56:58.007 --> 02:57:00.409
CARE DISPARITIES AND ALSO TO

02:57:00.476 --> 02:57:06.816
TRY TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY.

02:57:06.882 --> 02:57:08.517
ROUGHLY ELEVEN MONTHS AUSTIN

02:57:08.584 --> 02:57:10.686
HAS CONVENED A REVIEW COMMITTEE%

02:57:10.753 --> 02:57:12.154

02:57:22.531 --> 02:57:25.134
OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEY

02:57:25.201 --> 02:57:27.303
PROVIDED INPUT- AND I'M GONNA

02:57:27.370 --> 02:57:28.270
SPEAK TO SOME OF THE

02:57:28.337 --> 02:57:29.572
RECOMMENDATIONS LATER IN MY

02:57:29.638 --> 02:57:32.108
PRESENTATION- RELATED TO THE

02:57:32.174 --> 02:57:33.342

02:57:37.380 --> 02:57:39.315
AND AGAIN IF I COULD LEAVE YOU

02:57:39.382 --> 02:57:42.551

P. C. D. THAT'S BEING FORMED IN

02:57:44.020 --> 02:57:45.888
CALIFORNIA IT IS A NECESSARY

02:57:45.955 --> 02:57:48.090
TOOL TO SUPPORT THE PROPOSED-

02:57:48.157 --> 02:57:49.358
CALIFORNIA OFFICE ON

02:57:49.425 --> 02:57:53.562
AFFORDABILITY. SO THINKING

02:57:53.629 --> 02:57:55.664
ABOUT HOW THIS DATABASE CAN BE

02:57:55.731 --> 02:57:58.067
USED- RELATED TO COST

02:57:58.134 --> 02:58:00.569
CONTAINMENT EFFORTS- CLEARLY-

02:58:00.636 --> 02:58:03.305
IT'S I WILL ENABLE OUR- AT THE

02:58:03.372 --> 02:58:04.573
WORK IN TERMS OF TRACKING

02:58:04.640 --> 02:58:06.642
TRENDS AND SPENDING- WE CAN

02:58:06.709 --> 02:58:09.345
LOOK AT VARIATION AND COST. OF

02:58:09.412 --> 02:58:11.213
CARE AND- SOME OF THE FACTORS

02:58:11.280 --> 02:58:12.982
INFLUENCING THE VARIATION

02:58:13.049 --> 02:58:15.785
COSTS- WE CAN LOOK AT THE

02:58:15.851 --> 02:58:16.485
EFFECTIVE PROVIDER

02:58:16.552 --> 02:58:19.522
CONSOLIDATION- WE CAN ALSO LOOK

02:58:19.588 --> 02:58:20.990
AT WAYS FULL HEALTH HEALTH CARE

02:58:21.057 --> 02:58:24.560
SPENDING- AS WE TRIED TO- BAND

02:58:24.627 --> 02:58:27.963
THAT- COST CURVE- THE OTHER.

02:58:28.030 --> 02:58:30.433
IMPORTANT THING- CALIFORNIA HAS

02:58:30.499 --> 02:58:32.501
ALWAYS BEEN A LEADER AND- THERE

02:58:32.568 --> 02:58:34.470
IS HEALTH CARE REFORMS- AND

02:58:34.537 --> 02:58:36.072
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE

02:58:36.138 --> 02:58:37.339
EFFECTS OF THOSE HEALTH CARE

AREA OF PAYMENT POLICY- IS

02:58:41.343 --> 02:58:44.413

UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS THE

02:58:51.220 --> 02:58:52.955
SHARE OF TOTAL SPENDING GIVEN

02:58:53.022 --> 02:58:55.124
THAT WE KNOW PRIMARY CARE IS

02:58:55.191 --> 02:58:58.027
IMPORTANT- NOT ONLY FOR

02:58:58.094 --> 02:58:59.829
PROVIDING- HIGH QUALITY CARE TO

02:58:59.895 --> 02:59:01.097
PEOPLE BUT ALSO CONTROLLING

02:59:01.163 --> 02:59:04.500
SPENDING. AND THEN LASTLY-

02:59:04.567 --> 02:59:07.169
POTENTIALLY THE USE- OF THIS

02:59:07.236 --> 02:59:10.306
INFORMATION FOR MAKING- COSTS

02:59:10.372 --> 02:59:13.342
TRANSPARENT TO CONSUMERS. SO

02:59:13.409 --> 02:59:15.878
THE H. B. D. BEYOND COST CAN

02:59:15.945 --> 02:59:17.947
ALSO ANSWER OTHER KINDS OF

02:59:18.013 --> 02:59:19.615
CRITICAL QUESTIONS THE POLICY

02:59:19.682 --> 02:59:22.351
MAKERS HAVE- SO WE'VE ALREADY

02:59:22.418 --> 02:59:23.552
TALKED TO PROVIDE ABOUT

02:59:23.619 --> 02:59:26.155
PROVIDER CONSOLIDATION- WE WANT

02:59:26.222 --> 02:59:27.790
TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THE

02:59:27.857 --> 02:59:30.159
UTILIZATION OF CARE CHANGES IN

02:59:30.226 --> 02:59:32.461
RESPONSE TO PAYMENT CHANGES- WE

02:59:32.528 --> 02:59:34.296
WANT TO UNDERSTAND UTILIZATION

02:59:34.363 --> 02:59:36.031
OF SERVICES AND HOW THOSE

02:59:36.098 --> 02:59:37.266
DIFFER ACROSS DIFFERENT PATIENT

02:59:37.333 --> 02:59:39.602
POPULATIONS. AGAIN PLAYING TO

02:59:39.668 --> 02:59:41.737
THE ISSUE OF DISPARITIES- WE

02:59:41.804 --> 02:59:43.506
WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

02:59:43.572 --> 02:59:45.141
QUALITY OF CARE IS AND HOW THAT

02:59:45.207 --> 02:59:47.209
FAIRIES FOR- DIFFERENT PATIENT

02:59:47.276 --> 02:59:49.245
POPULATIONS AS WELL AS ACROSS

02:59:49.311 --> 02:59:51.580
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROVIDERS-

02:59:51.647 --> 02:59:53.249
I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED- THE

02:59:53.315 --> 02:59:55.651
ISSUE OF DISPARITIES

02:59:55.718 --> 02:59:57.453
UNDERSTANDING THE SOCIAL RISK

02:59:57.520 --> 02:59:58.621
FACTORS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED

02:59:58.687 --> 03:00:01.090
WITH QUALITY PERFORMANCE. AND

03:00:01.157 --> 03:00:02.558
WHETHER DISPARITIES ARE

03:00:02.625 --> 03:00:05.461
SHRINKING ARE GROWING OVER TIME

03:00:05.528 --> 03:00:07.163
AND RELATED TO COST QUESTION

03:00:07.229 --> 03:00:09.899
AND THIS GETS TO SOME OF- THE

03:00:09.965 --> 03:00:11.534
EARLIER SPEAKERS COMMENTS OUT.

03:00:11.600 --> 03:00:13.969
HEALTH WE HAVE THE ABILITY HERE

03:00:14.036 --> 03:00:15.437
TO LEVERAGE THESE DATA TO TRY

03:00:15.504 --> 03:00:17.173
TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER SOME

03:00:17.239 --> 03:00:18.107
PROVIDERS ARE MORE EFFICIENT

03:00:18.174 --> 03:00:20.976
AND DELIVERING QUALITY THAN

03:00:21.043 --> 03:00:24.046
OTHERS. SO BRIEF HOW SOME OF

03:00:24.113 --> 03:00:26.682
THE STATES YOU ARE A P. C. D.

03:00:26.749 --> 03:00:27.850
SO I'M I'M GOING TO BRING TOUCH

03:00:27.917 --> 03:00:30.553
ON A- OF SO THAT HAVE BEEN DONE

03:00:30.619 --> 03:00:32.555
SO IN VIRGINIA THERE WAS A

03:00:32.621 --> 03:00:34.290
STUDY THAT DEMONSTRATED- THERE

03:00:34.356 --> 03:00:36.392
WAS- FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

03:00:36.458 --> 03:00:37.760
SIX MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF

03:00:37.826 --> 03:00:39.895
LOW VALUE CARE SERVICES THAT

03:00:39.962 --> 03:00:41.230
DON'T PROVIDE BENEFIT TO

03:00:41.297 --> 03:00:43.365
PATIENTS. DELIVERED IN

03:00:43.432 --> 03:00:45.901
MINNESOTA THEY HAVE TRACKED

03:00:45.968 --> 03:00:46.502
TRENDS AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG

03:00:46.569 --> 03:00:48.604
SPENDING. BOB AND IN UTAH AND

03:00:48.671 --> 03:00:50.372
COLORADO THEY LOOKED AT

03:00:50.439 --> 03:00:52.041
INSURANCE TRANSITIONS AND WHAT

03:00:52.107 --> 03:00:54.310
HAPPENS TO PATIENTS AS THEY

03:00:54.376 --> 03:00:56.912
TRANCE. EXCUSE ME TRANSITION IN

03:00:56.979 --> 03:00:59.515
A LOT OF MEDICAID- SO. THREE

03:00:59.582 --> 03:01:01.750
IMPORTANT USE CASES- ANOTHER

03:01:01.817 --> 03:01:03.786
USE CASE- THAT I WOULD BRING TO

03:01:03.852 --> 03:01:05.487
YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE OF THE

03:01:05.554 --> 03:01:06.288
EMPHASIS ON MARKET

03:01:06.355 --> 03:01:09.091
CONSOLIDATION. SO MY GROUP AT

03:01:09.158 --> 03:01:11.126
RAND HAS BEEN LEVERAGING-

03:01:11.193 --> 03:01:13.829
MEDICARE DATA- AND THE DATA

03:01:13.896 --> 03:01:15.464
SHOWN ON THE SLIDE ARE ONLY THE

03:01:15.531 --> 03:01:17.666
MEDICARE DATA BUT WE COULD

03:01:17.733 --> 03:01:18.801
REPLICATE SOMETHING LIKE THIS

03:01:18.867 --> 03:01:20.069
IF WE HAVE THE ALL PAYER DATA

03:01:20.135 --> 03:01:22.438
BASE. I'M AND WHAT YOU SEE IS

03:01:22.504 --> 03:01:25.074
THAT OVER TIME BETWEEN TWENTY

03:01:25.140 --> 03:01:26.875
THIRTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN-

03:01:26.942 --> 03:01:28.544
THE NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS WHO

03:01:28.611 --> 03:01:31.046
ARE PRACTICING LATE PRACTICING

03:01:31.113 --> 03:01:34.083
INDEPENDENTLY HAS DECLINED- AND

03:01:34.149 --> 03:01:36.418
WE ALSO SEE- THIS YEAR A

03:01:36.485 --> 03:01:38.187
VERTICALLY INTEGRATED PHYSICIAN

03:01:38.254 --> 03:01:40.089
GROUPS GOING UP OVER TIME. AND

03:01:40.155 --> 03:01:41.824
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

03:01:41.890 --> 03:01:45.194
IMPLICATIONS ARE ON COSTS-

03:01:45.261 --> 03:01:46.629
WOULD BE A KLAY IMPORTANT AT

03:01:46.695 --> 03:01:47.997
QUESTION FOR THE STATE OF

03:01:48.063 --> 03:01:51.300
CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS- JUST

03:01:51.367 --> 03:01:52.401
LOOKING AT THE MEDICARE DATA WE

03:01:52.468 --> 03:01:54.737
FIND THAT. THIS CHANGE OVER

03:01:54.803 --> 03:01:56.572
TIME HAS LED TO SIGNIFICANTLY

03:01:56.639 --> 03:01:59.008
HIGHER SPENDING IN THE MEDICARE

03:01:59.074 --> 03:02:01.744
PROGRAM. SO ONE OF THE THINGS

03:02:01.810 --> 03:02:03.545
THAT'S UNIQUE IN CALIFORNIA

03:02:03.612 --> 03:02:06.382
COMPARED TO OTHER STATES- IT IS

03:02:06.448 --> 03:02:08.517
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A LARGE

03:02:08.584 --> 03:02:10.486
PROPORTION OF THE MARKET- THAT

03:02:10.552 --> 03:02:12.154
IS NOT PAID THROUGH FEE FOR

03:02:12.221 --> 03:02:16.058
SERVICE- TYPES OF PAYMENTS- AND

03:02:16.125 --> 03:02:17.593
HISTORICALLY A. P. CD'S HAVE

03:02:17.660 --> 03:02:19.328
FOCUSED ON PULLING IN THOSE FEE

03:02:19.395 --> 03:02:22.197
FOR SERVICE CLAIMS- SO WE HAVE

03:02:22.264 --> 03:02:23.532
A VARIETY OF ALTERNATIVE

03:02:23.599 --> 03:02:26.001
PAYMENT MODELS IN PLAY-

03:02:26.068 --> 03:02:27.636
CAPITATION BEING AT THE TOP OF

03:02:27.703 --> 03:02:29.805
THE LIST- BUT ALSO SOME OF

03:02:29.872 --> 03:02:31.674
THESEOTHER PAYMENTS LIKE-

03:02:31.740 --> 03:02:33.575
QUALITY BASED- PAY FOR

03:02:33.642 --> 03:02:35.411
PERFORMANCE PAYMENTS- SHARED

03:02:35.477 --> 03:02:38.747
SAVINGS PAYMENTS THAT- ARE IN

03:02:38.814 --> 03:02:40.215
THESE RESPECTS CONTRACTS- AS

03:02:40.282 --> 03:02:42.284
WELL. AS FOR THINGS LIKE

03:02:42.351 --> 03:02:44.086
PRIMARY CARE AND PATIENT

03:02:44.153 --> 03:02:47.489
CENTERED MEDICAL HOMES. SO IT

03:02:47.556 --> 03:02:49.925
IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT THAT

03:02:49.992 --> 03:02:52.895
AS IF HE'S THE DE AND CAL. IS

03:02:52.961 --> 03:02:54.863
DEVELOPED AND FALL. THAT WE

03:02:54.930 --> 03:02:56.999
WERE HARD TO CAPTURE BOTH THE

03:02:57.066 --> 03:02:59.101
CLAIM SPACE PIECE OF THIS AND

03:02:59.168 --> 03:03:01.770
THESE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENTS TO

03:03:01.837 --> 03:03:03.972
ESTIMATE THE TOTALITY OF

03:03:04.039 --> 03:03:04.973
PAYMENTS AND HEALTH CARE

03:03:05.040 --> 03:03:06.575
SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA. AND

03:03:06.642 --> 03:03:08.344
JUST AS A FOOTNOTE- OTHER

03:03:08.410 --> 03:03:10.579
STATES HAVE BEEN WORKING TO

03:03:10.646 --> 03:03:13.449
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE- COLORADO

03:03:13.515 --> 03:03:15.684
BEING ONE- AS WELL AS SOME OF

03:03:15.751 --> 03:03:16.652
THE WORK GOING ON HERE IN

03:03:16.719 --> 03:03:17.853
CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE

03:03:17.920 --> 03:03:20.089
INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE

03:03:20.155 --> 03:03:22.424
ASSOCIATION. I'M SO SOME OF THE

03:03:22.491 --> 03:03:23.759
OTHER IS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR

03:03:23.826 --> 03:03:24.960
THE HEALTH CARE PAYMENT

03:03:25.027 --> 03:03:27.429
DATABASE HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS

03:03:27.496 --> 03:03:28.997
THE NEED TO INCLUDE MEDICAL

03:03:29.064 --> 03:03:32.134
DATA- GIVEN THAT- ONE THIRD OF

03:03:32.201 --> 03:03:33.836
CALIFORNIANS ARE COVERED UNDER

03:03:33.902 --> 03:03:35.838
MEDICARE HOW- AND ONE OF THE

03:03:35.904 --> 03:03:37.740
RECOMMENDATIONS COMING OUT OF

03:03:37.806 --> 03:03:38.941
THE REVIEW COMMITTEE WAS THAT

03:03:39.007 --> 03:03:40.776
THE H. P. PROGRAM SHOULD PURSUE

03:03:40.843 --> 03:03:42.411
THE COLLECTION OF MEDI CAL DATA

03:03:42.478 --> 03:03:44.880
DIRECTLY FROM. THE DEPARTMENT

03:03:44.947 --> 03:03:47.583
OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES I'VE

03:03:47.649 --> 03:03:50.119
MENTIONED THE NEED FOR- PATIENT

03:03:50.185 --> 03:03:51.387
IDENTIFIERS AND PHYSICIAN

03:03:51.453 --> 03:03:53.589
IDENTIFIERS- IT'S REALLY

03:03:53.655 --> 03:03:54.890
CRITICAL TO BE ABLE TO TRACK

03:03:54.957 --> 03:03:56.692
PATIENTS OVER TIME AS WELL AS

03:03:56.759 --> 03:03:59.061
PROVIDERS OVER TIME- AND THESE

03:03:59.128 --> 03:04:00.896
ARE FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS FOR

03:04:00.963 --> 03:04:02.698
THE DATABASE TO BE USABLE BY A

03:04:02.765 --> 03:04:05.234
VARIETY OF END USERS- AND THEN

03:04:05.300 --> 03:04:08.771
LASTLY- I WOULD ENCOURAGE- AT.

03:04:08.837 --> 03:04:11.540
THE ASSEMBLY TO MAKE SURE THAT-

03:04:11.607 --> 03:04:13.575
ACCESS TO THE DATA IS BROADLY

03:04:13.642 --> 03:04:16.111
AVAILABLE- I KNOW THIS LOOKS

03:04:16.178 --> 03:04:18.280
FAIRLY SELF SERVING- AS I'M A

03:04:18.347 --> 03:04:20.749
RESEARCHER. BUT WE HAVE THE

03:04:20.816 --> 03:04:22.751
ABILITY- BOTH HERE IN THE STATE

03:04:22.818 --> 03:04:24.553
OF CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY-

03:04:24.620 --> 03:04:27.289
THERE IS A LOT OF- INTEREST BY

03:04:27.356 --> 03:04:28.891
RESEARCHERS TO BE ABLE TO

03:04:28.957 --> 03:04:31.326
LEVERAGE THESE DATA. AND I

03:04:31.393 --> 03:04:32.528
THINK THE STATE WOULD BE THE

03:04:32.594 --> 03:04:34.663
ULTIMATE BENEFACTOR HAVING A

03:04:34.730 --> 03:04:36.999
BROAD ACCESS TO THESE DATA BY A

03:04:37.065 --> 03:04:40.903
VARIETY OF END USERS SO JUST

03:04:40.969 --> 03:04:43.839
BRIEFLY THE CAL HEALTH OF HIM

03:04:43.906 --> 03:04:45.507
DATA. RIVER COMMITTEE ITS WORK

03:04:45.574 --> 03:04:47.109
LAST WEEK- THE FINAL

03:04:47.176 --> 03:04:48.510
RECOMMENDATIONS WERE POSTED

03:04:48.577 --> 03:04:51.480
LAST NIGHT- THE COMMITTEE MADE

03:04:51.547 --> 03:04:51.914
THIRTY SIX UNANIMOUS

03:04:51.980 --> 03:04:54.716
RECOMMENDATION STOSCH CODE- AND

03:04:54.783 --> 03:04:55.884
THEY RECOMMENDED A TIERED

03:04:55.951 --> 03:04:57.319
APPROACH TO IMPLEMENTING THAT

03:04:57.386 --> 03:04:58.954
WILL EXPAND THE DATABASE OVER

03:04:59.021 --> 03:05:00.556
TIME GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF

03:05:00.622 --> 03:05:03.459
CALIFORNIA- THIS DATABASE IS

03:05:03.525 --> 03:05:04.927
GOING TO BE THE LARGEST.

03:05:04.993 --> 03:05:07.496
DATABASE IN THE COUNTRY- AND WE

03:05:07.563 --> 03:05:09.064
HAVE CERTAIN MARKET DYNAMICS

03:05:09.131 --> 03:05:10.799
THAT ARE MORE COMPLEX THAN SOME

03:05:10.866 --> 03:05:12.434
OF THE OTHER STATES OR AT LEAST

03:05:12.501 --> 03:05:13.435
A LARGER PRESENCE OF THOSE

03:05:13.502 --> 03:05:16.972
ISSUES- AND SO- FOLLOWING A

03:05:17.039 --> 03:05:18.440
TIERED APPROACH I THINK WILL

03:05:18.507 --> 03:05:21.677
HELP US. MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY TO

03:05:21.743 --> 03:05:23.145
GET SOMETHING UP AND RUNNING-

03:05:23.212 --> 03:05:25.447
MORE QUICKLY BUT YOU KNOW

03:05:25.514 --> 03:05:26.748
CONTINUE TO EXPLORE HOW TO

03:05:26.815 --> 03:05:28.383
TACKLE SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS

03:05:28.450 --> 03:05:31.720
OVER THE LONG HAUL- THE OTHER

03:05:31.787 --> 03:05:34.022
ISSUE THAT CAME UP WAS- THEY

03:05:34.089 --> 03:05:35.858
MADE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT WHO

03:05:35.924 --> 03:05:39.361
SHOULD BE MANDATORY DATA

03:05:39.428 --> 03:05:41.830
BY. ALL COMMITTEE MEMBERS- ONE

03:05:41.897 --> 03:05:43.799
OF THE THINGS- THAT WILL BE

03:05:43.866 --> 03:05:45.133
MISSING IN THIS DATABASE

03:05:45.200 --> 03:05:47.936
BECAUSE OF A RISA- IS THAT SELF

03:05:48.003 --> 03:05:49.238
FUNDED PLANS WILL NOT BE

03:05:49.304 --> 03:05:51.773
REQUIRED TO SUBMIT- THAT I

03:05:51.840 --> 03:05:54.309
THINK STATES- AND OTHER ACTORS

03:05:54.376 --> 03:05:55.944
IN THE COMMUNITY SHOULD TRY TO

03:05:56.011 --> 03:05:57.846
WORK VERY HARD. TO GET THE

03:05:57.913 --> 03:05:58.780
SOUTH SHIRT PLANS TO SUBMIT

03:05:58.847 --> 03:06:03.886
THEIR DAY. THE AND I GUESS

03:06:03.952 --> 03:06:05.621
LASTLY ASHRITA NOW. TO FIND

03:06:05.687 --> 03:06:07.122
THIS WHICH IT EXPECTS TO

03:06:07.189 --> 03:06:09.658
DELIVER JULY FOR. OF THIS YEAR.

03:06:09.725 --> 03:06:11.593
SO WITH THAT I WILL STOP AND MY

03:06:11.660 --> 03:06:19.568
COLLEAGUES CHRISSY. BEFORE WITH.

03:06:19.635 --> 03:06:21.203
TO THE LITTLE SWITCH HERE IN A

03:06:21.270 --> 03:06:22.804
SECOND. THANK YOU THEN WHAT

03:06:22.871 --> 03:06:25.240
WE'LL ASK AT AT SPECTRUM BUT

03:06:25.307 --> 03:06:35.884
THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU AND

FUNDED A STUDY WHERE THEY FOUND

03:08:22.424 --> 03:08:24.192
THAT- CALIFORNIA WAS IN THE TOP

03:08:24.259 --> 03:08:26.161
SIX OF STATES- AND I'VE LISTED

03:08:26.228 --> 03:08:27.295
SOME OF THESE PROTECTIONS HERE

03:08:27.362 --> 03:08:28.397

EXPERIENCING A SURPRISE BILL

03:08:34.469 --> 03:08:35.370
WHEN AN OUT OF NETWORK

CARE FROM- IS FACING AT BALANCE

03:08:50.185 --> 03:08:51.486
BILLING FROM AN EMERGENCY

03:08:51.553 --> 03:08:52.721
DEPARTMENT VISIT. THE FAIR

03:08:52.788 --> 03:08:54.723
PRICING ACT PROTECTS LOW INCOME

03:08:54.790 --> 03:08:56.725
CALIFORNIANS FROM FACING- A

03:08:56.792 --> 03:08:58.427
HIGH CHARGE IF THEY'RE

03:08:58.493 --> 03:08:59.227
UNINSURED AND GO TO THE

03:08:59.294 --> 03:09:01.196
HOSPITAL. AND IN CALIFORNIA HAS

03:09:01.263 --> 03:09:02.631
VERY BROAD NETWORK ADEQUACY

03:09:02.698 --> 03:09:04.499
PER- PROTECTIONS RELATIVE TO

03:09:04.566 --> 03:09:06.134
OTHER STATES AND OF COURSE IF

03:09:06.201 --> 03:09:06.968
YOU HAVE A BROAD NETWORK THE

03:09:07.035 --> 03:09:10.338
CHANCES OF FACING AN OUT OF

03:09:10.405 --> 03:09:12.174
NETWORK CHARGE ARE MUCH LOWER.

03:09:12.240 --> 03:09:13.575
DESPITE ALL OF THESE FOR.

03:09:13.642 --> 03:09:15.410
ALMOST AT THE OF CAL HAVE

03:09:15.477 --> 03:09:17.112
RECEIVED AN UNEXPECTED BILL NOW

03:09:17.179 --> 03:09:18.880
SOME OF THIS COULD BE YOU KNOW

03:09:18.947 --> 03:09:19.948
PEOPLE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THEIR

03:09:20.015 --> 03:09:21.149
DEDUCTIBLE OR SOMETHING AD IT

03:09:21.216 --> 03:09:22.684
WAS UNEXPECTED BUT WITHIN YOU

03:09:22.751 --> 03:09:26.188
OFF THEIR HEALTH PLAN- BUT- BUT

03:09:26.254 --> 03:09:26.788
SOME OF THIS IS OUT OF NETWORK

03:09:26.855 --> 03:09:28.356
BUILDING. AND THE REASON THAT

03:09:28.423 --> 03:09:29.858
WE MAKING WE CONTINUE TO SEE

03:09:29.925 --> 03:09:30.759
THIS IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT

03:09:30.826 --> 03:09:32.761
THERE ARE SOME GAPS AND SO I'VE

03:09:32.828 --> 03:09:33.795
I'VE LISTED SOME HERE IN THIS

03:09:33.862 --> 03:09:36.031
CHART- AND YOU CAN SEE ONE BIG

03:09:36.098 --> 03:09:37.766
GAP IS SELF INSURED PLANS. AND

03:09:37.833 --> 03:09:38.734
SO THIS IS BECAUSE OF A

03:09:38.800 --> 03:09:40.302
RECESSION I'LL MENTION THAT-

03:09:40.368 --> 03:09:42.137
THAT WRIST A PRE AMPS THE STATE

03:09:42.204 --> 03:09:44.773
FROM REGULATING- SELF INSURED

03:09:44.840 --> 03:09:46.041
HEALTH PLANS ARE INTERFERING IN

03:09:46.108 --> 03:09:46.975
ANY WAY WITH THE CONTRACT

03:09:47.042 --> 03:09:48.443
BETWEEN PROVIDERS AND THOSE

03:09:48.510 --> 03:09:50.645
SELF INSURED HEALTH PLANS- BUT

03:09:50.712 --> 03:09:51.613
THEN THERE'S SOME OTHER GAPS

03:09:51.680 --> 03:09:53.048
INCLUDING SOME SERVICES THAT

03:09:53.115 --> 03:09:54.149
ARE NOT COVERED UNDER EITHER.

03:09:54.216 --> 03:09:55.350
ANY OF THESE LAWS SO FOR

03:09:55.417 --> 03:09:56.451
EXAMPLE OUT OF NETWORK

03:09:56.518 --> 03:09:58.386
AMBULANCE SERVICES. BILLS FOR

03:09:58.453 --> 03:10:00.222
INPATIENT STAYS THAT ORIGINATE-

03:10:00.288 --> 03:10:02.057
IN THE ET AND THEN ALSO THE

03:10:02.124 --> 03:10:03.091
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT BILLING

03:10:03.158 --> 03:10:04.760
PROTECTIONS DON'T EXTEND TO

03:10:04.826 --> 03:10:05.961
PLANTS REGULATED BY THE

03:10:06.027 --> 03:10:07.262
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

03:10:07.329 --> 03:10:09.030
INSURANCE. SO WHAT ARE SOME

03:10:09.097 --> 03:10:10.332
OPTIONS CALIFORNIA COULD TAKE

03:10:10.398 --> 03:10:12.634
HERE- ONE EASY ONE WOULD BE TO

03:10:12.701 --> 03:10:15.203
EXTEND THAT- THAT EMERGENCY

03:10:15.270 --> 03:10:16.638
DEPARTMENT PROTECTIONS TO THE

03:10:16.705 --> 03:10:19.274
CD I REGULATED PLANS- ALSO AT

03:10:19.341 --> 03:10:20.876
THE STATE COULD CONSIDER-

03:10:20.942 --> 03:10:22.377
EXTENDING PROTECTIONS TO COVER

03:10:22.444 --> 03:10:24.579
AMBULANCE SERVICES AN INPATIENT

03:10:24.646 --> 03:10:25.714
STAYS THAT ORIGINATE FROM THE

03:10:25.781 --> 03:10:27.816
ET- AND THEN ALSO POTENTIALLY

03:10:27.883 --> 03:10:29.050
THINK CREATIVELY ABOUT HOW TO

03:10:29.117 --> 03:10:30.719
ADDRESS THE ARREST- ISSUE. SO

03:10:30.786 --> 03:10:32.087
ONE- SOLUTION THAT'S BEEN

03:10:32.154 --> 03:10:33.955
PROPOSED IS TO REQUIRE

03:10:34.022 --> 03:10:35.490
ANCILLARY VISIT PHYSICIANS TO

03:10:35.557 --> 03:10:36.658
CONTRACT WITH THE HOSPITALS IN

03:10:36.725 --> 03:10:38.193
WHICH THEY'RE WORKING. AND SO

03:10:38.260 --> 03:10:39.594
THAT YOU KNOW GETS THE STATE

03:10:39.661 --> 03:10:41.263
OUT OF REGULATING THE CONTRACT

03:10:41.329 --> 03:10:42.831
BETWEEN THE PROVIDER AND THE IN

03:10:42.898 --> 03:10:44.232
SELF INSURED EMPLOYERS. IT

03:10:44.299 --> 03:10:45.801
WOULD BE THE CONTACT BETWEEN

03:10:45.867 --> 03:10:49.971
THE HOSPITAL AND THE PROVIDER.

03:10:50.038 --> 03:10:50.572
ONE THING I DO WANT TO OUT OF

03:10:50.639 --> 03:10:51.706
THE APPROACH IS TO ADDRESS OUT

03:10:51.773 --> 03:10:53.375
OF NETWORK BILLING. THIS OF

03:10:53.441 --> 03:10:54.442
COURSE OF THE PROBLEM FOR

03:10:54.509 --> 03:10:55.844
CONSUMERS IN TERMS OF HEALTH

03:10:55.911 --> 03:10:57.646
CARE AFFORDABILITY BUT HOW IT

03:10:57.712 --> 03:10:59.347
AFFECTS TOTAL COST OF CARE WILL

03:10:59.414 --> 03:11:01.116
DEPEND ON HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED.

03:11:01.183 --> 03:11:02.417
SO IN SOME SENSE PROTECTING

03:11:02.484 --> 03:11:03.718
CONSUMERS MORE FROM OT OF

03:11:03.785 --> 03:11:05.353
NETWORK CHARGES COULD RESULT IN

03:11:05.420 --> 03:11:06.521
CONSUMERS EATING USING MORE

03:11:06.588 --> 03:11:08.490
CARE- OR IF THERE'S A

03:11:08.557 --> 03:11:09.624
REQUIREMENT THAT THE INSURANCE

03:11:09.691 --> 03:11:12.160
COMPANY. PAY MORE- THAT COULD

03:11:12.227 --> 03:11:13.094
AFFECT THEIR LEVERAGE

03:11:13.161 --> 03:11:14.296
NEGOTIATION WITH PROVIDERS

03:11:14.362 --> 03:11:16.231
ULTIMATELY LEADING TO INCREASED

03:11:16.298 --> 03:11:18.300
COST OVERALL- ON THE ON THE

03:11:18.366 --> 03:11:20.135
FLIP SIDE SOLUTIONS THAT WOULD

03:11:20.202 --> 03:11:21.503
LIMIT WHAT THE PROVIDER IS ABLE

03:11:21.570 --> 03:11:23.371
TO CHARGE MIGHT BE MORE LIKELY

03:11:23.438 --> 03:11:24.706
TO REDUCE COST. SO THE CAREFUL

03:11:24.773 --> 03:11:26.942
CONSIDERATION IS NEEDED IN

03:11:27.008 --> 03:11:27.509
IMPLEMENTING THESE KINDS OF

03:11:27.576 --> 03:11:30.478
POLICIES. OKAY SO I MOVED TO

03:11:30.545 --> 03:11:31.713
HELP THEM REGULATION OTHER

03:11:31.780 --> 03:11:33.081
STYLIZED FACTS THAT YOU'RE ALL

03:11:33.148 --> 03:11:34.316
VERY FAMILIAR WITH BASICALLY

03:11:34.382 --> 03:11:35.283
THE COST OF CARE HAVE.

03:11:35.350 --> 03:11:36.751
INCREASED DRAMATICALLY FOR

03:11:36.818 --> 03:11:37.752
INSURANCE PREMIUMS INSURANCE

03:11:37.819 --> 03:11:40.422
DEDUCTIBLES OVER THE PAST TEN

03:11:40.488 --> 03:11:41.623
TO FIFTEEN YEARS. SO I WANT TO

03:11:41.690 --> 03:11:43.291
TURN NOW BACK TO RHODE ISLAND

03:11:43.358 --> 03:11:44.693
IN THIS IS AN EXAMPLE FROM UP

03:11:44.759 --> 03:11:46.461
ROAD ISLAND I KNOW THAT- GLENN

03:11:46.528 --> 03:11:49.030
HAD ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS- BUT

03:11:49.097 --> 03:11:50.198
JUST BRIEFLY YOU KNOW BIRD

03:11:50.265 --> 03:11:51.499
ISLAND. IMPLEMENTED THESE VERY

03:11:51.566 --> 03:11:52.734
COMPREHENSIVE AFFORDABILITY

03:11:52.801 --> 03:11:55.170
STANDARDS- THAT INCLUDED A

03:11:55.237 --> 03:11:56.438
MOVING TOWARDS VALUE BASED

03:11:56.504 --> 03:11:59.307
PAYMENT- THE SETTING A LIMIT ON

03:11:59.374 --> 03:12:01.276
WHAT AT THAT. PRICE INCREASES

03:12:01.343 --> 03:12:03.478
COULD COULD OCCUR FROM YEAR TO

03:12:03.545 --> 03:12:03.945
YEAR WITH AN INSURANCE

03:12:04.012 --> 03:12:04.913
CONTRACTS. AND THEN ALSO

03:12:04.980 --> 03:12:06.314
INCREASING SPENDING ON PRIMARY

03:12:06.381 --> 03:12:07.616
CARE SAID THE STATE ACTUALLY

03:12:07.682 --> 03:12:10.118
DIRECTED ON INSURANCE COMPANIES

03:12:10.185 --> 03:12:11.319
TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON PATIENT

03:12:11.386 --> 03:12:13.321
CENTERED MEDICAL HOMES- AND A

03:12:13.388 --> 03:12:15.790
RECENT STUDY FOUND. THAT THIS

03:12:15.857 --> 03:12:16.558
LED TO A FIVE POINT 8%

03:12:16.625 --> 03:12:18.226
REDUCTION IN IN SPENDING AMONG

03:12:18.293 --> 03:12:19.060
THE COMMERCIALLY INSURED

03:12:19.127 --> 03:12:20.729
POPULATION. AND YOU CAN SEE

03:12:20.795 --> 03:12:22.530
THAT BROKEN OUT HERE THERE WAS

03:12:22.597 --> 03:12:23.632
A REDUCTION IN FEE FOR SERVICE

03:12:23.698 --> 03:12:25.600
SPENDING OFFSET SOMEWHAT BY AN

03:12:25.667 --> 03:12:26.902
INCREASE IN NON FEE FOR SERVICE

03:12:26.968 --> 03:12:29.871
SPENDING BUT THE NET. EFFECT

03:12:29.938 --> 03:12:32.240
WAS A 5% REDUCTION. NUMBER

03:12:32.307 --> 03:12:33.241
DILATED VERY DIFFERENT FROM

03:12:33.308 --> 03:12:36.311
HEALTH. AS YOU KNOW IN MANY

03:12:36.378 --> 03:12:37.312
WAYS AND THIS IS THE

03:12:37.379 --> 03:12:38.446
REGULATIONS THAT THEY PUT IN

03:12:38.513 --> 03:12:40.115
PLACE WERE ALSO FAIRLY.

03:12:40.181 --> 03:12:41.983
EXTENSIVE AND YOU KNOW MAYBE

03:12:42.050 --> 03:12:43.985
IT. THAT BE TOO AMBITIOUS OR A

03:12:44.052 --> 03:12:45.253
YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF.

03:12:45.320 --> 03:12:46.588
THEY'RE THERE AT WEB MY POINT

03:12:46.655 --> 03:12:48.023
IS THAT THERE COULD BE. SOME

03:12:48.089 --> 03:12:50.091
MORE OF THIS. TARGETED

03:12:50.158 --> 03:12:51.526
APPROACHES THAT MIGHT ACHIEVE

03:12:51.593 --> 03:12:52.961
SIMILAR RESULTS- IT SO

03:12:53.028 --> 03:12:54.396
CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY DOESN'T

03:12:54.462 --> 03:12:55.897
HAVE THE AUTHORITY IF YOU OF

03:12:55.964 --> 03:12:56.831
COURSE THERE'S RATE REVIEW IN

03:12:56.898 --> 03:12:58.166
CALIFORNIA BUT THE STATE DOES

03:12:58.233 --> 03:12:59.534
NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DENY

03:12:59.601 --> 03:13:02.337
RATES IT THEIR- EXCESSIVE- JUST

03:13:02.404 --> 03:13:03.338
MOVING TO THAT IS. POTENTIALLY

03:13:03.405 --> 03:13:04.773
SOMETHING THAT COULD SAVE COST

03:13:04.839 --> 03:13:06.374
SO ANOTHER STATE STUDY FOUND

03:13:06.441 --> 03:13:07.075
THAT STATES THAT HAVE THE

03:13:07.142 --> 03:13:09.210
ABILITY TO DENY. HAVE LOWER

03:13:09.277 --> 03:13:11.146
PREMIUMS THAN OTHER STATES AND

03:13:11.212 --> 03:13:11.980
THE ESTIMATE WOULD BE ABOUT

03:13:12.047 --> 03:13:13.982
FOUR PERCENT. FOR FOUR POINT 6%

03:13:14.049 --> 03:13:17.786
SAVINGS- AT LEAST FOR THE

03:13:17.852 --> 03:13:19.187
INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE MARKET.

03:13:19.254 --> 03:13:21.156
OKAY LET ME MOVE NOW QUICKLY TO

03:13:21.222 --> 03:13:22.190
THE PUBLIC OPTION FOR

03:13:22.257 --> 03:13:24.826
CALIFORNIA. SO PUBLIC OPTION

03:13:24.893 --> 03:13:27.629
HAS A LOT OF MEETINGS- WHEN WE

03:13:27.696 --> 03:13:29.264
DEFINE PUBLIC OPTION WE MEAN A

03:13:29.331 --> 03:13:31.132
PLAN THAT HAS GOVERNMENT

03:13:31.199 --> 03:13:32.634
NEGOTIATED RATES THAT CAN

03:13:32.701 --> 03:13:33.835
EITHER BE MEDICATED COULD BE

03:13:33.902 --> 03:13:34.803
MEDICARE COULD BE SOME

03:13:34.869 --> 03:13:36.805
PERCENTAGE OF OE OF THOSE TWO.

03:13:36.871 --> 03:13:39.040
OR SOMETHING ELSE BUT THE KEY

03:13:39.107 --> 03:13:39.541
IS THAT IT'S NEGOTIATED

03:13:39.607 --> 03:13:43.545
PUBLICLY. SO HOW COULD IT COULD

03:13:43.611 --> 03:13:44.779
PUBLIC OPTION SAVE MONEY WELL

03:13:44.846 --> 03:13:46.081
ONE CHALLENGE IN ESTIMATING

03:13:46.147 --> 03:13:47.415
THIS IS THAT A PUBLIC OPTION

03:13:47.482 --> 03:13:48.350
JUST HAS NOT YET BEEN

03:13:48.416 --> 03:13:49.851
IMPLEMENTED ANYWHERE AND SO WE

03:13:49.918 --> 03:13:50.986
DON'T REALLY KNOW WE HAVE TO

03:13:51.052 --> 03:13:53.855
RELY ON FORECAST SIMULATIONS-

03:13:53.922 --> 03:13:56.725
THE CBO AND RAND HAVE ESTIMATED

03:13:56.791 --> 03:13:58.526
628% SAVINGS OUT AT LEAST AMONG

03:13:58.593 --> 03:13:59.894
THOSE CONSUMERS AFFECTED BY THE

03:13:59.961 --> 03:14:01.696
PUBLIC OPTIONS SO THERE IS SOME

03:14:01.763 --> 03:14:03.298
SOME EVIDENCE THERE AND IN

03:14:03.365 --> 03:14:05.133
WASHINGTON STATE AND ALSO THE

03:14:05.200 --> 03:14:06.534
STATE OF COLORADO ARE CURRENTLY

03:14:06.601 --> 03:14:08.903
IMPLEMENTING WASHINGTON STATE'S

03:14:08.970 --> 03:14:09.871
PUBLIC OPTION WILL GO INTO

03:14:09.938 --> 03:14:11.773
EFFECT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND

03:14:11.840 --> 03:14:12.874
SO WE'LL KNOW MORE AFTER THAT

03:14:12.941 --> 03:14:14.609
HAPPENS AS TO HOW EXACTLY THIS

03:14:14.676 --> 03:14:16.211
PLAYS OUT IN TERMS OF COST

03:14:16.277 --> 03:14:19.280
CONTROL- BUT YOU KNOW ONE.

03:14:19.347 --> 03:14:20.348
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION FOR

03:14:20.415 --> 03:14:21.549
CALIFORNIA AND THINKING ABOUT

03:14:21.616 --> 03:14:23.351
THIS IS THAT IT MAY BE

03:14:23.418 --> 03:14:24.786
DIFFICULT TO GET PROVIDERS TO

03:14:24.853 --> 03:14:26.588
AGREE ON ON SIX SUBSTANTIALLY

03:14:26.654 --> 03:14:28.623
LOWER RATES SO IN WASHINGTON

03:14:28.690 --> 03:14:30.992
STATE- ULTIMATELY THE PUBLIC

03:14:31.059 --> 03:14:32.861
OPTION IS GOING TO HAVE RATES

03:14:32.927 --> 03:14:34.129
THAT ARE ON OUR 110060% OF

03:14:34.195 --> 03:14:36.464
MEDICARE BUT THE STATUS QUO IS

03:14:36.531 --> 03:14:39.601
ABOUT A 174% OF MEDICARE SO

03:14:39.667 --> 03:14:40.135
THIS IS A LESS THAN 10%

03:14:40.201 --> 03:14:42.103
REDUCTION AND SO THAT WAS A LOT

03:14:42.170 --> 03:14:43.438
OF WORK TO GET TO WHAT MIGHT BE

03:14:43.505 --> 03:14:44.906
SOMEWHAT OF A MARGINAL CHANGE

03:14:44.973 --> 03:14:46.975
AND THE OTHER ISSUE TO CONSIDER

03:14:47.042 --> 03:14:48.143
IS THAT. IT TO THE EXTENT THAT

03:14:48.209 --> 03:14:49.277
THIS IS AFFECTING ENROLLEES ON

03:14:49.344 --> 03:14:51.546
THE MARKET PLACES THE MAJORITY

03:14:51.613 --> 03:14:52.680
EVEN RELEASED ON THE MARKET

03:14:52.747 --> 03:14:54.349
PLACE IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVE TAX

03:14:54.416 --> 03:14:55.950
CREDITS AND THE WAY THOSE TAX

03:14:56.017 --> 03:14:57.218
CREDITS OR STRUCTURE STRUCTURE

03:14:57.285 --> 03:14:58.853
IS THE INDIVIDUAL PAYS A

03:14:58.920 --> 03:15:01.056
PERCENT INCOME CONTRIBUTION AND

03:15:01.122 --> 03:15:02.824
THEN THE TAX CREDIT COVERS THE

03:15:02.891 --> 03:15:05.360
REMAINDER OF THE PREMIUM COST

03:15:05.427 --> 03:15:05.827
UP TO THE PRICE OF THE

03:15:05.894 --> 03:15:07.195
BENCHMARK PLAN. SO TO THE

03:15:07.262 --> 03:15:08.430
EXTENT THAT THE PUBLIC OPTION

03:15:08.496 --> 03:15:09.564
AFFECTS THE COSTS OF THE

03:15:09.631 --> 03:15:11.833
BENCHMARK PLAN IT COULD HAVE

03:15:11.900 --> 03:15:14.035
THE EFFECT OF LOWERING THE THAT

03:15:14.102 --> 03:15:15.403
TAX CREDITS WITHOUT AFFECTING

03:15:15.470 --> 03:15:17.338
THAT THE CONSUMERS BOTTOM LINE

03:15:17.405 --> 03:15:18.306
AND SO ANOTHER IMPORTANT

03:15:18.373 --> 03:15:20.175
CONSIDERATION- AND BEYOND THAT

03:15:20.241 --> 03:15:21.509
YOU KNOW THE SAVINGS FROM

03:15:21.576 --> 03:15:25.146
REDUCED TAX CREDITS WILL COURSE

03:15:25.213 --> 03:15:25.713
GO PRIMARILY TO THE FEDERAL

03:15:25.780 --> 03:15:29.250
GOVERNMENT. OKAY LET TURN TO MY

03:15:29.317 --> 03:15:29.951
BEST OPTION THIS IS EXPANDING

03:15:30.018 --> 03:15:32.454
PARTNER PRACTITIONER SCOPE. A

03:15:32.520 --> 03:15:33.922
THIRTY AND SO CALIFORNIA IS

03:15:33.988 --> 03:15:35.957
OFTEN A LEADER- IN TERMS OF

03:15:36.024 --> 03:15:37.559
STATES AND IN TERMS OF ADOPTING

03:15:37.625 --> 03:15:40.195
INNOVATIVE- SOLUTIONS. NOT AS

03:15:40.261 --> 03:15:41.429
MUCH NECESSARILY WITH NURSE

03:15:41.496 --> 03:15:42.964
PRACTITIONER SCOPE OF PRACTICE

03:15:43.031 --> 03:15:45.467
CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE STAR

03:15:45.533 --> 03:15:46.434
TWENTY FIVE STATES THAT DON'T

03:15:46.501 --> 03:15:48.436
HAVE BROAD AUTHORITY FOR NURSE

03:15:48.503 --> 03:15:51.272
PRACTITIONERS. THERE IS

03:15:51.339 --> 03:15:52.207
EVIDENCE THAT NURSE

03:15:52.273 --> 03:15:54.175
PRACTITIONERS A PROVIDE CARE IN

03:15:54.242 --> 03:15:55.910
IN A LESS COSTLY MANNER THEN

03:15:55.977 --> 03:15:57.846
THEN THEN EMPTIES SO THIS IS A

03:15:57.912 --> 03:15:59.681
STUDY THAT COMPARED THE TOTAL

03:15:59.747 --> 03:16:03.485
COST OF CARE OVER A YEAR. AMONG

03:16:03.551 --> 03:16:04.252
PATIENTS ASSIGNED TO A NURSE

03:16:04.319 --> 03:16:05.553
PRACTITIONER AS THEIR PRIMARY

03:16:05.620 --> 03:16:07.288
CARE PROVIDER COMPARED TO THOSE

03:16:07.355 --> 03:16:09.390
ASSIGNED TO A AND D. AS THEIR

03:16:09.457 --> 03:16:11.126
PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER THE USER

03:16:11.192 --> 03:16:12.894
RISK ADJUSTED SO WHERE WE'RE

03:16:12.961 --> 03:16:13.728
DEALING WITH GOT READ THIS

03:16:13.795 --> 03:16:14.829
ADDRESSES DIFFERENCES IN

03:16:14.896 --> 03:16:16.898
PATIENT ACUITY AND CONDITIONS-

03:16:16.965 --> 03:16:18.733
AND YOU CAN SEE ACROSS VARIOUS

03:16:18.800 --> 03:16:21.236
MEASURES OF COST OF CARE- THE

03:16:21.302 --> 03:16:22.403
NURSE PRACTITIONERS PROVIDED

03:16:22.470 --> 03:16:24.038
LOWER COST OF CARE. RANGING

03:16:24.105 --> 03:16:29.511
FROM ELEVEN TO. 29% SAVINGS.

03:16:29.577 --> 03:16:31.045
ANOTHER IMPORTANT THAT WAS

03:16:31.112 --> 03:16:32.213
RAISED WE HEAR THE DEBATE ABOUT

03:16:32.280 --> 03:16:33.248
NURSE PRACTITIONER SCOPE OF

03:16:33.314 --> 03:16:35.150
PRACTICE IS WHETHER QUALITY OF

03:16:35.216 --> 03:16:36.751
CARE COULD BE AFFECTED. AND IN

03:16:36.818 --> 03:16:37.719
THE LITERATURE REVIEW WE

03:16:37.785 --> 03:16:38.720
REVIEWED FOR CALIFORNIA

03:16:38.786 --> 03:16:40.088
HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION WE FOUND

03:16:40.155 --> 03:16:42.023
THAT THAT AS NOT THE CASE AND

03:16:42.090 --> 03:16:43.458
IN FACT WE FOUND EVIDENCE THE

03:16:43.525 --> 03:16:44.192
QUALITY OF CARE MAY BE

03:16:44.259 --> 03:16:46.261
IMPROVED. SO THIS IS FROM I

03:16:46.327 --> 03:16:47.295
THOUGHT A CLEVER STUDY THAT

03:16:47.362 --> 03:16:50.632
LOOKED AT- HOW CHANGES IN. IS

03:16:50.698 --> 03:16:52.333
GO PRACTICE LOS ACROSS STATES

03:16:52.400 --> 03:16:54.369
OVER TIME- WE'RE SO SEE IT WITH

03:16:54.435 --> 03:16:56.437
CHANGES IN VARIOUS MEASURES OF

03:16:56.504 --> 03:16:58.673
QUALITY- AND SO YOU CAN SEE

03:16:58.740 --> 03:17:00.141
THAT THE STUDY FOUND THAT THERE

03:17:00.208 --> 03:17:00.909
WAS AN INCREASE IN THE

03:17:00.975 --> 03:17:02.577
PROBABILITY OF HAVING OF. A

03:17:02.644 --> 03:17:03.878
ROUTINE CHECK UP AS COOPER

03:17:03.945 --> 03:17:05.413
PRACTICE EXPANDED AND

03:17:05.480 --> 03:17:06.881
INCREASING THE PROBABILITY OF

03:17:06.948 --> 03:17:08.483
HAVING USUAL SOURCE OF CARE.

03:17:08.550 --> 03:17:10.218
I'M INCREASING THE PROBABILITY

03:17:10.285 --> 03:17:11.152
THAT PATIENTS RATED THEIR

03:17:11.219 --> 03:17:12.520
HEALTHCARE QUALITY IS

03:17:12.587 --> 03:17:14.789
EXCELLENT- AND INCREASING THE

03:17:14.856 --> 03:17:16.157
PROBABILITYTHE PATIENTS RATED

03:17:16.224 --> 03:17:16.925
THEIR HEALTH STATUS IS

03:17:16.991 --> 03:17:18.593
EXCELLENT- WHAT WE WHERE WHERE

03:17:18.660 --> 03:17:20.328
THEY DID FIND A DECREASE WAS AN

03:17:20.395 --> 03:17:21.796
EASY VISIT SO A SLIGHT

03:17:21.863 --> 03:17:22.764
REDUCTION EDIE DOES IT'S

03:17:22.830 --> 03:17:24.465
PERHAPS BECAUSE PATIENTS WERE

03:17:24.532 --> 03:17:25.700
HEALTHIER OR BECAUSE THEY WERE

03:17:25.767 --> 03:17:28.536
USING. AT THAT THEY HAD A USUAL

03:17:28.603 --> 03:17:34.742
SOURCE OF CARE. SO SOME RATES

03:17:34.809 --> 03:17:36.878
THE RICE CONCLUDE THOUGHTS

03:17:36.945 --> 03:17:37.478
THERE MANY PROMISE OPTIONS FOR

03:17:37.545 --> 03:17:38.846
CAO IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN

03:17:38.913 --> 03:17:39.647
MIND. IS A UNIQUE STATES YOU

03:17:39.714 --> 03:17:41.883
KNOW THERE IS SOME. YOU IT BUT

03:17:41.950 --> 03:17:42.417
WE HAVE TO THINK CAREFULLY

03:17:42.483 --> 03:17:43.151
WHETHER THESE WILL ALTER.

03:17:43.218 --> 03:17:44.686
DIRECTLY TO CALIFORNIA ONE

03:17:44.752 --> 03:17:45.853
IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IN

03:17:45.920 --> 03:17:48.556
CALIFORNIA VERSUS OTHER STATES

03:17:48.623 --> 03:17:49.157
IS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A MUCH

03:17:49.224 --> 03:17:50.658
GREATER PENETRATION OF MANAGED

03:17:50.725 --> 03:17:52.560
CARE. AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT

03:17:52.627 --> 03:17:53.761
SOME OF THESE POLICIES ARE

03:17:53.828 --> 03:17:55.363
CAPTURING LOW HANGING FRUIT.

03:17:55.430 --> 03:17:56.598
MAYBE MANAGED CARE'S ALREADY

03:17:56.664 --> 03:17:58.166
ADDRESSING SOME OF THAT IN AND

03:17:58.233 --> 03:17:58.866
IT MAY BE A LITTLE MORE

03:17:58.933 --> 03:18:01.169
DIFFICULT. ON THE OTHER THING

03:18:01.236 --> 03:18:02.570
TO CONSIDER IS THAT MANY OF

03:18:02.637 --> 03:18:03.271
THESE OPTIONS LOOK LIKE THEY

03:18:03.338 --> 03:18:04.872
SAVE A HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY

03:18:04.939 --> 03:18:05.607
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DOLLAR

03:18:05.673 --> 03:18:07.542
VALUE. BUT WHEN YOU COMPARE

03:18:07.609 --> 03:18:09.677
THAT TO CALIFORNIA'S YOU KNOW

03:18:09.744 --> 03:18:10.245
THREE HUNDRED BILLION EVEN

03:18:10.311 --> 03:18:11.446
BASED ON THE TWENTY FOURTEEN

03:18:11.512 --> 03:18:15.116
ESTIMATE- ANNUAL SPENDING- ET

03:18:15.183 --> 03:18:16.851
THEIR SMALL PERCENTAGES SO IT'S

03:18:16.918 --> 03:18:18.219
PROBABLE THAT. THAT THE STATE

03:18:18.286 --> 03:18:19.153
WILL HAVE TO IMPROVE MULTIPLE

03:18:19.220 --> 03:18:20.688
POLICY OPTIONS IT WANTS IN

03:18:20.755 --> 03:18:21.856
ORDER REALLY BEND THE COST

03:18:21.923 --> 03:18:23.925
CURVE- AND THEN FINALLY I JUST

03:18:23.992 --> 03:18:25.360
WANT TO CONCLUDE BY SAYING THE

03:18:25.426 --> 03:18:27.128
CALIFORNIA. I'M HAS A TRADITION

03:18:27.195 --> 03:18:28.596
OF BEING AN EARLY ADOPTER AND A

03:18:28.663 --> 03:18:30.231
TREND SETTER ACROSS THE COUNTRY

03:18:30.298 --> 03:18:31.366
YOU KNOW THAT. THAT'S TRUE IN

03:18:31.432 --> 03:18:34.702
MANY AREAS FASHION- TECHNOLOGY-
