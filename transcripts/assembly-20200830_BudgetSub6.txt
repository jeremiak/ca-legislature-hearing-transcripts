SINCE THIS IS OUR LAST HEARING DURING THIS VERY UNUSUAL PANDEMIC YEAR LET ME JUST START OFF BY TAKING OUR ASSEMBLY SERGEANTS WERE HERE IN THE ROOM WITH US THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE. ASSEMBLY TV THE RULES COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATIVE DATA CENTER AND LEAD COUNSEL- IT WAS QUITE A HERCULEAN FEAT I THINK IF YOU HAD TALKED TO US IN APRIL WHEN WE WERE. ON RECESSING WE HAD TO TIME IMAGINE. WHETHER WE'D BE ABLE TO HOLD IN PERSON HEARINGS OR HOW WE'D BE ABLE TO DO THAT HOW WOULD BE ABLE TO INVOLVE THE PUBLIC- AND I KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD SOME UPS AND DOWNS OF THE HEARINGS ARE REALLY ASK- IN APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S PATIENCE AND RESPECT. FOR THE PROFIT THE WE'VE DONE OUR BEST TO TRY TO INCORPORATE ALL THE PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AT THE SAME TIME MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN KEEP- THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM WHO ARE PHYSICALLY HERE SAFE. AND WE'RE VERY PROUD OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE DONE THAT SO FAR ALSO WANTED TO THANK THE L. A. O. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL AS MY BUDGET STAFF FOR THAT HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS OF WORK TO. CRAFT THIS YEAR'S BUDGET AND ALSO GET THE LAST FINAL A BILL THROGH- THIS YEAR HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO BE IN OFFICE TOGETHER WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PHYSICALLY BE A ROOSTER. AND WORKING REMOTELY AS WE ALL KNOW IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EFFICIENT FROM FROM OUR OFFICES STANDPOINT AND BEING IN PERSON-SO IT'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. SO BOB LET ME STOP THERE AND TO SEE IF MY VICE CHAIR. WOULD MIDDLE MICHAEL TO MY BECAUSE WE LAST THE LAST WITH HIS LIFE BUT IS WHAT WE- IS ALWAYS ONE MORE HUMAN BUT I THOUGHT OPENED. OPEN COMING UP TO MY VOICE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK FOR CAN. THIS YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING I CAN'T FEEL. TWO DIFFERENT WAYS ABOUT THE HEARING OR AVING TO BE ON THE ONE HAND I'M GRATEFUL THAT WHEN BILLS ARE SUBS. SUBSTANTIVELY AMENDED. THAT WE TAKE THE TIME. AND DEMONSTRATE THE TRANSPARENCY TO HEAR THOSE BILLS AGAIN AND COMMITTEE. BEFORE THEY GO TO THE FLOOR. ON THE OTHER HAND TODAY I AM DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THREE OF THE BILLS THAT WERE. AND I JUST CAME INTO. ON FRIDAY. AND THIS IS THE FIRST COMMITTEE HEARING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE BEFORE THEY'RE VOTED ON. ONE DAY BEFORE THE END OF SESSION WHICH IS TOMORROW. THESE ARTISTS VERY SUBSTANTIVE POLICY BILLS FIRST OF ALL THEY HAVE NO PLACE BEING. HEARD IN A BUDGET COMMITTEE THEY SHOULD BE BUDGET BILLS AT ALL. AND SECOND OF ALL. I THINK TRANSPARENCY. AND PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY DEMANDS THAT. WHEN WE DISCUSS SOMETHING SO SUBSTANTIVE THAT WE GIVE. A LITTLE BIT. MORE TIME FOR THE PUBLIC TO WEIGH IN AND COMMENT AND- GIVE OURSELVES A BIT MORE TIME T BE DELIVERED ABOUT THIS SO I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THAT WE'LL ALL TALK. ABOUT THE SPECIFIC BILLS AS WE MOVE THROUGH BUT- I JUST DIDN'T FEEL LIKE. I COULD- I COULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY GO BY WITHOUT SAYING THAT. GREAT THANK YOU MISPRICED OR ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE MEMBERS BEFORE WE START. OKAY PERFECT SO LET'S START ON TO THE FIRST BILL WHICH IS GOING TO BE S. B.

HOWEVER I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THE MAJORITY OF THE MINUTES AND THE STILL DO REFLECT TECHNICAL CLEANUP AND CONFORMING CHANGES- HOWEVER THIS BILL DOESN'T INCLUDE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND- APPROPRIATE. AND ALSO INCLUDE SOME NON TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS. SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MANY OF THESE APPROPRIATIONS AND NON TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS. ARE INTENDED TO ASSIST THE STATE. IN OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND THE IMPACT OF THE CODE NINETEEN RECOVERY- ALSO. AS FOR INSTANCE THERE IS AN EFFORT AND AID IN AN EFFORT IN EIGHT TO PROMOTE THIS AT ECONOMIC STIMULUS THIS BILL CONTAINS A PACKAGE OF AMENDMENTS.

EIGHT ONE FIVE WHICH IS THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT TRAILER BILL. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CAROLYN CHIU FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AS A CHARITY MENTIONED SB EIGHT FIFTEEN IS THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT CLEAN UP BILL- RELATIVE TO- THE BILL THAT WAS HEARD AND- THIS COMMITTEE A FEW DAYS AGO THERE ARE A FEW CHANGES ALL NOTE- ONE OF THE MORE SIGNIFICANT ONES. ARE SPECIFICALLY SB EIGHT FIFTEEN WOULD MAKE CLARIFICATIONS TO THE ENFORCEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROVISIONS CONTAINED WITHIN AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE. AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE ESTABLISH A STREAMLINED PROCESS FOR APPROVING FARMWORKER HOUSING AND PROHIBITED THE USE OF STATE FUNDING FOR FARMWORKERS WITH H. TWO A. VISAS. THIS BILL WOULD CLARIFY THE VARIOUS STATE HOUSING PROGRAMS FOR MIGRANT FARM WORKERS IS PROHIBITED FROM BEING RENTED SOLD OR SUBLEASED TO AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYERS WHO EMPLOY WORKERS WITH H. TWO A. VISAS. BUT THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE PROVISIONS OR OTHER PROVISIONS IN THE BILL. THANK YOU FINANCE. MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR MEMBERS CHRIS COOK WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- NO FURTHER QUESTIONS I HEARD EXCUSE ME NO FURTHER COMMENTS ON. ON THIS BILL BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND HAVE COLLEAGUES HERE TO ASSIST AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY. MEMBERS MISTER COOPER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LESS TROUBLE TO YES ON AB SEVENTY THREE BECAUSE THE GOAL OF THE US PROVIDE MORE HOUSING THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITTED INCREASING STATE SUPPORT OF HOUSING HOWEVER THIS BILL SEEMS TO BE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION BY STATING THAT IMP THAT ANY EMPLOYER WHO HIRES EVEN ONE H. TWO EMPLOYEE CANNOT UTILIZE ANY HOUSING THE SUBSIDIZED BY THE STATE. MIAC EMPLOYERS HAVE BOTH H. TWO A. AND NOT H. TWO EMPLOYEES OF THIS BILL ALSO PROHIBIT THOSE NON H. TWO EMPLOYEES FROM UTILIZING EMPLOYER PROVIDED HOUSING THE SUBSIDIZED BY THE STATE. TO PROVIDE INSURANCE OF. MISTER COOPER DANIELLE BRENDA CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT YOUR QUESTION WITH THIS BILL ALSO PROHIBIT THOSE NON H. TWO EMPLOYEES FROM UTILIZING EMPLOYER PROVIDED HOUSING THAT IS SUBSIDIZED BY THE STATE. THIS DANIEL BRANDON WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE EMPLOYEE HAS THE PROGRAM OVERSEES THE PROVISIONS EMPLOYEE HOUSING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF THE PLACE IMMIGRATION STATUS. THE PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY EACH CD IN CONJUNCTION WITH LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES- THE CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS STATE FUNDED HOUSING PROGRAMS RE USED FOR H. TWO A. EMPLOYEES THE PROPOSAL ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO ACCESS ANY HOUSING THAT IS FUNDED BY THE STATE. HOWEVER EACH TO A EMPLOYERS CANNOT RENTS HOUSING SUBSIDIZED BY THE STATE AS WAS THE INTENT OF AB AT SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE. THE GOAL OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE TO CHANGE THAT AND BUILD MORE HOUSING IN THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITTED TO INCREASING THE FUNDING. PROVIDING A CERTAIN HOUSING COULD NOT BE PROVIDED. TO GUEST AG WORKERS AND MY QUESTION IS THE UNRUH CIVIL RIGHTS ACT SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION IN HOUSING. BASED ON IMMIGRATION STATUS I APPRECIATE THIS TRAILER BILL IS INTENDED TO FIX THAT PROBLEM IN AB SEVENTY THREE. SO I NEED TO ASK. DOES THIS TRAILER BILL ALLOW FOR EACH TO EMPLOYEES TO UTILIZE HOUSING THAT IS BUILT WITH FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE STATE. IN THIS PAPER DANIEL BRAND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE PROPOSAL ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO ACCESS ANY HOUSING THAT IS FUNDED BY THE STATE IT DOESN'T ALLOW EACH TO A EMPLOYERS TO ACCESS HOUSING FUNDED BY THE STATE. SO I'M CONCERNED THIS BILL MAY HINDER ACCESS FOR SOME EMPLOYEES TO THE STATE'S HOUSING FOR THE HARVEST PROGRAM. OFFERING TEMPORARY HOTEL HOUSING TO AGRICULTURAL WORKERS WHO NEED TO ISOLATE DUE TO COVE IN NINETEEN. THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY SUPPORTS THIS NEWLY LAUNCHED PROGRAM. TO ASSIST COVER NINETEEN POSITIVE OR EXPOSE WORKERS BY PROVIDING THEM HOUSING TO SELF ISOLATE. ACCORDING TO THE STATE THE SEAL THE COVER NINETEEN WEBSITE. THE STATE IS INTRICATELY INVOLVED IN COORDINATING. THE BOOKING OF HOUSING FOR THE HARVEST HOTEL ROOMS. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH PARTICIPATING COUNTIES.THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM COUNTYTO COUNTY BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE FUNDED WITH A MIX OF FEDERAL FUNDS. COUNTY FUNDS. IN NONPROFIT FUNDS WHICH MAY INCLUDE STATE FUNDING AND AGAN PLAYER FUNDING AS WELL. SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. WITH THE POLICIES OUTLINED IN THIS BILL POTENTIALLY DENY SUCH CRUCIAL HOUSING TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES. BASED ON IMMIGRATION STATUS BECAUSE YOU STAYED FUNDS TO HOUSE H. TWO EMPLOYEES IS NOT ALLOWED. NO SIR. OKAY THANK YOU. MISTER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO JOIN MR COOPER IN EXPRESSING SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THIS RECENTLY- ADDED PROVISION REGARDING H. TO A HOUSING INDUSTRY LOWER BILL. SO AT MY QUESTION IS TWO FOLD FIRST OF ALL- WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF ADDING THIS LANGUAGE. DARWINIST AND WHAT IT'S- WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IT AND THE SECOND QUESTION IS. WHAT IS SO URGENT ABOUT THIS THAT IT NEEDED TO BE ADDED INTO THIS TRAILER BILL THE DAY BEFORE THE END OF THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION. THANK YOU DANIEL BRANDON I'M FIRST AT. A FOR FINANCE I THINK YOU'RE A MEMBER. FIREWOOD FIRST NOTE THAT THIS TRAILER BILL WAS FIRST PRESENTED IN FEBRUARY WITH ABOUT 90% OF THE TIME- CONTENT REMAINING THE SAME THE CHANGES ENSURE THAT KNOWING IMMIGRATION RECORDS ARE REQUESTED AS A MEANS OF MEETING A REQUIREMENT. TO NOT ALLOW STATE FUNDED HOUSING TO BE USED TO HOUSE H. TWO A. EMPLOYEES. CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS THIS FOR ANY HOUSING FUNDED AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TO DATE IN A NEWLY CONSTRUCTED HOUSING IS AN FUNDED THAT IS AFFECTED BY THIS DEPARTMENT. I WOULD NOTE THAT. HELLO PARDON ME. UNDER WITHOUT THIS LANGUAGE H. H. CITY WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT NO H. TWO A. WORKERS LIVE IN ANY HOUSING PROJECT IN WHICH EACH CD FUNDS ARE INVESTED. TO ENSURE THIS H. THE WOULD HAVE TO COMPLETE A TENANT FILE CHECK OF NON EACH CITY UNITS. THIS PROPOSAL NARROWS THE SCOPE REQUIRING EACH CITY TO ONLY INSPECT UNITS FOR WHICH IT PROVIDED FUNDING WITHOUT THIS PROPOSALS THE COST TO IMPLEMENT AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE WOULD XCEED TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND NINE MILLION ANNUALLY ONGOING. THAT IS WHY WE BELIEVE IT'S NEEDED NOW. OKAY AND I DON'T. I DON'T A BELIEVER THE POINT BUT IF YOU BELIEVED IT WAS NEEDED ON FRIDAY WHY DIDN'T THE BILL THAT WE HEARD LAST WEEK HAVE THE AND IT. IS MY QUICKNESS RHETORICAL YOU DON'T NEED TO ANSWER BUT THE BUT I MEAN YOU SEE THE POINT HI THIS IS A SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES CAUSED. SUBSTANTIAL CONCERNS FROM THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY IN THE STATE AND I THINK IT DESERVES A FAIR HEARING AND A BALANCED- LEGISLATIVE EFFORT TO DETERMINE THAT THE NEEDS OF EVERYONE ARE BEING MET HERE AND WE'RE NOT GIVING IT THAT EFFORT AND THAT THAT'S- REALLY DISAPPOINTING. FOR ALL UP I APOLOGIZE FOR BELIEVING THE POINT BUT I GUESS I HAVE TO ASK WHY IS THERE A DISTINCTION BE MADE BETWEEN H. TWO A. INDIVIDUALS AND KNOWLEDGE TO INDIVIDUALS. WHAT'S THE RATIONALE. THE H. TWO A. PROGRAM IS A FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAM OF FEDERALLY FEDERAL PROGRAM NOT STATE PROGRAM. RIGHT BUT WHY WHY ARE YOU SAYING THAT THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE AND EVERYONE ELSE IS. THEIR BACKGROUND THERE IS M. AND MY MISSING SOMETHING WHERE IT'S JUST BECAUSE IT'S A FEDERAL PROGRAM. THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY OR I MEAN IT HAS TO BE SOME OTHER. DEVICE I THINK I CAN ASK A CLARIFYING QUESTION JUST TO FINANCE. DO. OKAY LET ME JUST. SO DO DO H. TWO A. EMPLOYERS HAVE TO. PROVIDE HOUSING AS A CONDITION OF THE VISA. YES SIR SO THEREFORE BECAUSE THEY ARE ABLE TO BRING IN THIS LABOR FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY PART OF THE AGREEMENT IS THEY CAN. BRING IN FOREIGN LABOR BUT THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE. THE EMPLOYEES HOUSING IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT AND SO IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THE STATE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO SUBSIDIZE THAT HOUSING. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SINCE I WAS UP THE POLICY. I'M SORRY MR TANG AT MEMBER TEAM I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU I. MOST OF. I THINK THAT IS RELATIVELY HELPFUL I JUST AND I GUESS THAT'S SOME TURN UNDERSTAND THE- WITH THE RATIONALE BEHIND THE POLICY DECISIONS ESPECIALLY AS IT'S SO LATE IN THE IN THE PROCESS AND THIS IS BEING THRUST UPON US IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND. THE BACKGROUND OF WHY THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING BECAUSE YOU'RE FORCING US TO DECIDE IN. LESS THAN FORTY FORTY EIGHT HOURS. THE DEPRECIABLE MY COLLEAGUES FEEDBACK I WOULD SAY. THAT AGAIN US DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REITERATED- THIS WAS CLEAN UP THAT HOME WAS PROMISED WHEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS IS BILL THE SIGNED- I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A TRAILER BILL THAT WAS RELEASED EARLY IN THE YEAR US DEPARTMENT FINANCE STATED- I THINK THAT THE- LATENESS OF THIS WAS BECAUSE- IT TOOK UNTIL NOW TO REACH AN AGREEMENT. AND MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE RATIONALE AND ANYBODY CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. IS THAT AGAIN- THE EMPLOYERS GOT A BENEFIT BECAUSE THEY GET TO USE A VISA PROGRAM TO BRING IN LABOR. PART OF THAT. THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE HOUSING. THAT'S THAT IS THE AGREEMENT TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THE VISA PROGRAM. THEREFORE THE STATE AT THIS POINT DOESN'T FEEL ANY OBLIGATION TO. SUBSIDIZE THAT PARTICULAR PROPOSAL OR PROGRAM BECAUSE THE BENEFIT THAT THE EMPLOYER COTTON WAS THE VISA. SO AGAIN THAT IS MY- THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND AGAIN THIS IS BEEN. IN DISCUSSIONS FOR- THE BETTER PART OF THIS BUDGET YEAR AYE I WAS MADE AWARE OF THIS ISSUE. VERY EARLY ON IN THE BUDGET PROCESS IS TO- THE BACK AND FORTH NEGOTIATIONS IT IS IT IS- I WISH THAT THE RESOLUTION HAVE COME SOONER. BUT I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT BECAUSE THAT DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN GOING ON THEY HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR QUITE AWHILE. I GUESS ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS THE- THE COLOR NINETEEN IS KIND OF WILD CARD BECAUSE IF SOMEONE DOES CONTRACT OVER NINETEEN. OBVIOUSLY AND THEY'VE GOT FAMILY BETTER MOVE AWAY. BUT THEY AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR THE HOUSING FOR THE HARVEST SO. TO ME THAT THAT CONNECTS FACTOR THAT WASN'T PLANNED SO. IT JUST WOULD BE. I'M TRYING TO WRAP MY OWN AROUND THE REASONING IS DENYING THEM THAT. IF THEY ARE IF THEY TEST POSITIVE FOR COVERT HAVE TO QUARANTINE. THE BIG BIG BUT AGAIN- JUST CLARIFY. THAT THE EMPLOYEE ANGER AND FINANCE PLEASE CLARIFY THIS. THE EMPLOYEE. CAN ACCESS THAT. PROGRAM IT'S JUST THE EMPLOYER CANNOT SO THE FOR MORE WATER CAN. IS THAT CORRECT. THE EMPLOYEE OF THE FARMWORKERS AND CROWDED HOUSING THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THE PROGRAM WE'RE JUST NOT SUBSIDIZING THE FARMER WHO GOT THE BENEFIT OF THE VISA PROGRAM. SO LET'S NOT WHICH LET'S JUST CLARIFY WHAT THE ISSUE IS. SO THE FARM WORKER WHO IS IN CROWDED HOUSING AS MY COLLEAGUES KNOW BROS OF LOCALLY PUT HAS THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THE PROGRAM. LOOK AT THE QUESTIONS. GOOD LUCK AB EIGHT TWENTY. EIGHT POINT. SANTA BARBARA CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THANK MANY HEARD THAT EDUCATION TRAILER BILL- ON TUESDAY SINCE THAT TIME TO SET SOME AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE BILL FIRST A COUPLE OF PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN ADDED CLARIFYING THAT YOU SEE CAN CONTRACT OUT FOR CONSTRUCTION AND REQUIRE WORK THESE PROVISIONS AFFIRM THE AUTHORITY THAT YOU SEE HAS UNDER EXISTING LAW SECOND THE SECOND SIDE OF PROVISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED. I RELATE TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE KIDS SAVINGS ACCOUNT PROGRAMS THE PROVISIONS CONFORM TO SB TWELVE THIRTY SEVEN UNDER THE PROVISIONS- PARENTS AT THE TIME OF THEIR CHILD'S BIRTH WOULD BE ASKED FOR THEIR CELL NUMBERS AS WELL AS THEIR EMAIL ADDRESSES IF THEY WANTED TO VOLUNTARILY PROVIDE THEM THIS FATHER SON PASSED MY BOARD WOULD BE ABLE TO USE THAT INFORMATION ONLY FOR PURPOSES. OF OPENING KIDS ACCOUNTS. A QUICK SO OF THE NEW PURPOSE BEFORE YOU. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FINANCE. CHRIS FERGUSON WITH FINANCE NOTHING TO ADD ON THIS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. THE TROUBLE WITH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SO EXPRESSED SOME SERIOUS RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE PROVISIONS. RESTRICTING THE UC'S ABILITY TO CONTRACT WHEN WE HEARD THIS BILL LAST WEEK AND I'M VERY HAPPY THAT THOSE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN ALTERED I'M STRUGGLING HOWEVER A LITTLE BIT TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE UC IS NOT PERMITTED TO CONTRACT OUT FOR NOW SO COULD SOMEONE. EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- WHAT CHANGES EXACTLY THE BILL THE TRAILER BILL MADE. SO JENNIFER PATALA FROM THE LAND ANALYST OFFICE I'M TO CLARIFY THOSE PROVISIONS YOU TALKED ABOUT ON TUESDAY ARE STILL IN THE BILL SO THE BILL WOULD STILL PROHIBIT YOU SEE FROM CONTRACTING OUT FOR SERVICE RELATED WORK ON ITS STATE FUNDED ACADEMIC BUILDINGS. CLEANING GROUNDS CREW OF FOOD DINING YOU SEE UNDER EXISTING LAW IS PROHIBITED FROM DOING THAT ANYWAYS BUT IT'S A LIMITED TERM RESTRICTION THAT EXTENDS THROUGH JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. THE BILL YOU HEARD ON TUESDAY WHICH IS THE SAME VERSION THAT STILL BEFORE YOU TODAY REMOVES THAT SUNSET DATE SUCH THAT YOU SEE WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM CONTRACTING OUT FOR THOSE SERVICES INDEFINITELY. SO I THINK THOSE CONCERNS YOU MENTIONED JUST TO CLARIFY THERE STILL EMBEDDED IN THE BILL BEFORE YOU. RIGHT SO YOU KNOW I SEE THAT THAT THE BILL. STILL PROHIBITS CONTRACTING OUT FOR CLEANING MAINTENANCE GROUNDS KEEPING FOOD SERVICE RATHER WORK. TRADITIONALLY PERFORMED BY EMPLOYEES BUT THEN THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS FOR. WORK DESIGNED TO PRESERVE PROTECT OR KEEP ANY PUBLICLY OWNED FACILITY IN A SAFE AND USABLE CONDITION SO. THAT TO ME THAT'S JUST OPENING UP THE DOOR FOR LITIGATION BECAUSE- OR ARE WE ARE WE NOT THE FOR LACK OF SPECIFICITY HERE ARE WE OPENING- UP- SCRUTINY ON EXACTLY WHAT IS REQUIRED TO KEEP A BUILDING IN SAFE CONDITION YOU KNOW AS GROUNDS KEEPING PART OF THAT. YOU COULD ARGUE THAT IS YOU COULD ARGUE THAT IT'S NOT- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT- WHAT DO THINK ABOUT THAT. UNFORTUNATELY THAT SOUNDS LIKE A BETTER QUESTION MAYBE FOR LEGISLATIVE COUNCILLOR FOR LAWYERS I'M THERE IS PROVISION AND- I THINK IT'S THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT I'M SORRY THE LABOR CODE TODAY. THAT DOES ALLOW YOU SEE TO GO OUT FOR A VERY SIMILAR THINGS AND THE THINGS BEFORE YOU CONSTRUCTION. RENOVATION OF REPAIR WORK ON THIS LANGUAGE BEFORE YOU MY READ OF IT IS IT IS SLIGHTLY MORE SPECIFIC WHEN IT COMES TO THE OTHER KINDS OF THINGS LIKE PAINT DEAN AND GLAZING. EXISTING LAW IS A LITTLE BIT MORE GENERAL SO THE CURRENT CONCERNS YOU RAISE THAT MAYBE THERE IS BECOMING A BLURRED LINE. BETWEEN THIS MORE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE ON PAINTING AND GLAZING I'M EXCITED ABOUT. I MIGHT BE AN ISSUE BUT- I WOULD BE GOING A LITTLE BIT BEYOND- IT'S MORE OF A LEGAL QUESTION AS TO WHAT GROUPS WOULD BE CONCERNED THAT WHAT YOUR LIABILITY MIGHT BE. THANK YOU. WELL THE ONLY REASON I BRING IT UP IS I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN BEING AS SPECIFIC AS WE CAN WHEN WE PUT LANGUAGE LIKE THIS IN THE BILLS BECAUSE I WOULD. PREFER THAT WE HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS. HERE WE'RE CRAFTING THELEGISLATION AND NOT OPEN IT UP. TO LAWYERS ARGUING ABOUT WHAT WE MENTIONED WHAT WE DID NOT MEAN. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SB FIFTY TWO TO THE WORKER PROTECTION TRAILER BILL. HELLO. EARNING AGAIN CAROLINE CHIU FROM LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SB EIGHT TWENTY TWO AS A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS RELATED TO JOB PROTECTED LEAVE AND PAID SICK LEAVE I'LL HIGHLIGHT THREE OF THEM FOR YOU TODAY FIRST R. S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO STOP A MEDIATION PILOT PROGRAM AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING THE MEDIATION WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO SMALL EMPLOYERS THOSE EMPLOYERS WITH FIFTEEN FIVE TO NINETEEN EMPLOYEES PRIOR TO HAVE AN EMPLOYEE FILING A LAWSUIT THAT ALLEGES THE BUSINESS DID NOT FOLLOW THE STATE'S JOB PROTECTED LEAVE LOS. IF MEDIATION FAILS LAWSUITS WOULD BE ALLOWED TO PROCEED AS USUAL. THE MEDIATION PROGRAM WOULD ONLY GO INTO AFFECTED THE STATE AN AXE SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE TO REQUIRE SMALL BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE JOB PROTECTED LEAVE. THE SECOND PROVISION THAT I'LL HIGHLIGHT ARE CREATES A SUPPLEMENTAL TWO WEEK PAID SICK LEAVE PROGRAM FOR FOOD INDUSTRY EMPLOYEES AFFECTED BY KOBE NINETEEN. THIRD SECTOR EMPLOYEES WOULD BE ELIGIBLE IF THEIR ORDER TO QUARANTINE OR SELF ISOLATE OR CANNOT WORK BECAUSE OF. CLOSED DUE TO COVE IN TRANSMISSION. THIS PROVISION LARGELY CODIFIES THE GOVERNOR'S ODD APRIL SIXTEENTH EXECUTIVE ORDER. THE LAST CRUISE AND THEN I'LL HIGHLIGHT I'VE- THE IS- ONE THAT CREATES A SUPPLEMENTAL TWO WEEK PAID SICK LEAVE PROGRAM FOR EMPLOYEES WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL EMERGENCY PAID SICK LEAVE ENOUGH- FAMILIES FIRST. CORONAVIRUS RELIEF ACT. SPECIFICALLY THE STATE SUPPLEMENTAL TO REPEAT SICKLY PROGRAM WOULD COVER HEALTHCARE WORKERS EMERGENCY RESPONDERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL. AND EMPLOYEES. AND EMPLOYEES OF BUSINESSES WITH MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES NATIONWIDE. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. MISTER WITHOUT. MARK COMMENT THAN A QUESTION THIS IS ONE OF THE BILLS THAT I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WAS RAISED SO LATE IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WE HAVE BEEN DEBATING CORONA VIRUS RELATED RELIEF LEGISLATION FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS IN THIS BODY TO ME IT IS COMPLETELY UNCONSCIONABLE THAT THIS LANGUAGE SHOULD BE INTRODUCED INTO A BILL ON FRIDAY THE DAY OF THE WEEKEND BEFORE THE MONDAY OF THE LAST DAY OF SESSION. BOB THE SECOND BALL I DON'T SEE HOW THIS IS POSSIBLY A BUDGET BILL I MEAN WE'VE WE'VE GOT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR APPROPRIATION IN HERE OTHER THAN THAT THE MEAT OF THE BILL IS A VERY SUBSTANTIVE POLICY ISSUE THAT I THINK IS MORE TO PROPERLY DEBATED POLICY COMMITTEE BUT I MEAN LASTLY LET ME JUST POINT OUT THAT THE EIGHTY COMMON ARGUMENT THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING HERE WE TALK ABOUT PUTTING MORE RESTRICTIONS ON THE STATE'S EMPLOYERS WITH RESPECT TO CORONAVIRUS IS THIS MISCONCEPTION THAT. IF WE FORCE EMPLOYERS TO PAY MORE THEN THAT'S JUST MEANS THAT THEY'LL MAKE A LITTLE LESS PROFIT THIS YEAR I MEAN LONG TERM IT'S A ZERO SUM GAME SOMEBODY HAS TO PAY THE PRICE FOR THAT OUR BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING THEY CAN'T CONTINUE TO STAY IN BUSINESS IF LONG TERM THEY DON'T MAKE MORE THAN THEY SPEND SO THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCE OF EVERYTHING THAT WE DO HERE IS TO RESIST WHEN WE PUT A NEW RESTRICTION ON- HAVING TO PAY BENEFITS FROM AN EMPLOYER IN AN ATTEMPT TO TRY AND MITIGATE THIS CORONAVIRUS SITUATION IS LONG TERM OR FORCING THOSE COMPANIES TO RAISE PRICES IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH IS REGRESSIVE AND HURTS THE VERY SAME PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO HELP. SO A I PROBABLY STARTED UP IT BUT DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THIS BILL IN FRONT OF US TODAY. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. FURTHER THOUGHTS COMMENTS QUESTIONS THE ONLY COMMENT I DO THINK R. I. STRAHAN'S A FAIR POINT I THINK- WE DID DO A GOOD JOB THIS YEAR OF TRYING TO LIMIT AS MANY OF THE LAST MINUTE- PROPOSALS AS WELL AS WE KNOW- YOU KNOW HUMAN NATURE IS WHEN YOU HAVE A DEADLINE PEOPLE- START TO. TAKE IT MORE SERIOUSLY AND THERE'S ALWAYS ISSUES THAT END UP BEING RESOLVED AT THE LAST MINUTE- THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE KNOW HAS BEEN IN A VERY IMPORTANT AS WE SEEN MANY ESSENTIAL WORKERS I GET SICK. AND UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE MANY ESSENTIAL WORKERS ARE HOURLY AND WHEN THEY GET SICK THEY DON'T GET PAID- THERE DID NOT GETTING SICK LEAVE- THE ARE REALLY HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GOING TO WORK AND GETTING PAID TO PAY THEIR BILLS OR- STAYING HOME AND NOT GETTING PAID OR IF THEY GO TO WORK THEY GET SICK THERE ON A THREAT TO GET CORONAVIRUS AND WE ARE. WE ARE VERY LUCKY ONE WHICH YOU ARE WE ARE HERE AT WORK- AND- DOING OUR JOB WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE BEEN COLLECTING OUR SELLERS SO AGAIN- I APPRECIATE THE BUSTERS COME INTO THINK THERE THROUGH THE WALL WELL SAID- BUT I THINK WE DO ARE WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN TRYING TO. ENSURE THAT THE A SOCIAL WORKERS WHO WE ARE SENDING INTO THE GROCERY STORES AND TO THE FACTORIES INTO THE PROCESSING PLANTS- YOU KNOW RISKING EXPOSURE MANY OF WHOM HAVE GOTTEN EXPOSED THAT THEY ALSO HAVE ON SOME OF THE VERY BENEFITS THAT WE HAVE AS WELL IN TERMS OF. SUPPORT SO WITHOUT A SINGLE OTHER COMMENTS WE WERE GOING TO MOVE ON TO S. B. EIGHT TWO THREE. WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I WILL BE PRESENTING SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE WHICH WOULD REMIND THE STATE'S DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE DJJ TO THE COUNTIES. IT WAS FIRST ISCUSSED IN THIS COMMITTEE ON TUESDAY AUGUST TWENTY FIFTH AND WAS IN RESPONSE TO- ADMINISTRATION MAY REVISION PROPOSAL ALSO WOULD REALIGN THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND COUNTIES. I'LL BE FOCUS M COMMENTS DOWN THE SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE SENSE AND INTERIM SINCE TUESDAY. WILD INTENT REMAINS A CLOSE DJ JAY A SPECIFIC CLOSURE DATE IS NOT SPECIFIED IN THE CURRENT VERSION OF S. B. TWENTY THREE. AND NTAKE WOULD CLOSE ON JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE- WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. FOR THE YOUTH YOU ARE ADMITTED TO DJ AFTER JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THEY COUNTY AND PEOPLE ARE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY THREE THE COUNTIES AND PAY A FEE OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR- CURRENTLY COUNTY TO PAY A FEE OF TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOUR YEARS FOR WHO ARE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY THIRTY IN OUR HOUSE AND DJ. THE REALIGNMENT WOULD BE FUNDED THROUGH TO GRANT PROGRAM. THE FIRST WOULD BE A ONE TIME. GRANT OF NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TO PROVIDE COUNTIES THE RESOURCES FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. AT REALLY NEEDS IMPROVEMENTS TO ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL CONTINUUM OF CARE. AND THE SECOND WOULD BE AN ONGOING BLOCK GRANT. TO SUPPORT COUNTY BASED CUSTODY CARE AND SUPERVISION OF REALIGNED YOU. THAT GRANT WOULD START AT THIRTY NINE POINT NINE MILLION AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AN INCREASE TO TWO HUNDRED EIGHT MILLION BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. AND ONGOING WITH ADJUSTMENTS FOR GROWTH AND- JUVENILE JUSTICE GROWTH SPECIAL ACCOUNT. THAT DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. WOULD BE BASED ON A FORMULA THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT EACH COUNTY CHAIRED THE STATE'S YOUTH POPULATION. PRIOR USE OF DJJ IN RECENT YEARS AND THE NUMBER OF YOU THAT YOU TO CARE FOR SERIOUS OR VIOLENT OFFENSES. BEFORE. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE THE METHODOLOGY FOR DISTRIBUTING THE FUNDING WOULD BE SUBJECT TO REVISION. TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDING IS DISTRIBUTED ON NOW THE BEST IMPROVES OUTCOMES FOR THE REAL LINE POPULATIO. LIKE PRIOR VERSIONS COUNTIES WOULD BE GUARANTEED A MINIMUM FUNDING AMOUNT OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WOULD HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO CONTACT OTHER COUNTIES TO PROVIDE SERVICES. COUNTIES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT PLANS FOR STATE APPROVAL BEFORE RECEIVING FUNDING. BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE THE PASSWORD BEING VIEWED BY THE% OFFICE OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION WHICH WOULD BE A NEW STATE ENTITY ESTABLISHED UNDER THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. ON JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE OFFICE MISSION WOULD BE TO PROMOTE TRAUMA RESPONSIVE. JOHN CULTURALLY INFORMED SERVICES FOR YOUTH NVOLVED IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT SUPPORT THE YOUTH SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION INTO ADULTHOOD AND HELP THEM BECOME RESPONSIBLE THRIVING AND ENGAGE MEMBERS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FINANCE. HI COUNTERPART IN A FINANCE- HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY TO BE IN AGREEMENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THIS IMPORTANT REFORM I'M NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS THAT AND THEN IT ACT ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. MISTER COOPER THANK YOU MISTER TANK. THERE'S NO REASON THIS HAS TO HAPPEN NOW. THE STATE WANTS TO SHIFT THIS PROBLEMS TO THE COUNTIES. WHEN THE MIST OF A WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC CAN IS LOST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BECAUSE THE SHUT DOWN THE STATE IS RELEASED THOUSANDS OF OFFENDERS. THE MINISTRATION INSIST ON DOING THIS FORCED REALIGNMENT THEY'RE SITTING COUNTIES UP TO FAIL. THE MINISTER NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE REAL ISSUES TRAPPING COUNTIES WITH MAJOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROJECT THAT BELONGS TO THE STATE. THE STORE ABOUT A YEAR AGO THIS PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE SHIFTED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. AND NOTHING LATE IN THE LAP OF THE COUNTIES. TO A POINT WHERE THE PROBATION CHIEFS ARE OPPOSED. ONE MAJOR ISSUE HERE IS THAT A BIRD IS BEING GIVEN TO THEM IN ADDITION TO THE STATE OVERSIGHT. AN EXTREME. LEVEL REMAINS. THAT CAN CAUSE FOR FINANCE CAN YOU TELL ME HOW SECTION THIRTY ONE. NINE TWELVE HOUR PAGE THIRTY EIGHT OF THIS PROPOSAL WILL AFFECT THE COUNTY'S. ARE THEY GETTING PENALIZED FOR NOT MEETING ALL THE REQUIREMENTS IN A TIMELY MANNER THIS BILL. SORRY I'M TRYING. AND FOR SECTION THIRTY ONE HERE SO I CAN MAKE SURE I HAVE THE YES THAT'S THE ONE- NINE TWELVE OR PAGE THIRTY EIGHT. OF THE PROPOSAL. SO THE INTENT HERE IS THAT- OUR PROPOSAL STARTS FUNDING COUNTY IS AT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PER ON A STATEWIDE BASIS AND PROVIDING MONEY. IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO HOWEVER GIVEN THE REALIZATION THAT THIS WILL BE YOU KNOW IT'LL TAKE LONGER FOR COUNTIES TO HAVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE WHERE ALLOWING CERTAIN USED TO STILL COUNTY DJJ. SO BASIC THIS PROVISION IS STRUCTURED SO THAT IF A YOUTH DOES COME TO THE STATE- WELL THE STATE'S ACTUALLY PROVIDING FUNDING TO THEMFOR THAT USE THEY WERE PROVIDED THEY WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE TO PASS A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS SO IT'S KIND OF. THE STATE RECRUITING COSTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE BLOCK BLOCK GRANT FORMULA BUT AS A WAY OF ALLOWING CERTAIN USED TO STILL COME TO THE STATE IF I COUNTY DOESN'T HAVE THEIR PROGRAMS UP. AND TO AVOID THEM GOING TO THE ADULT COURT SYSTEM AS AN ALTERNATIVE SO RIGHT NOW THE STATE'S PAY. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER OFFENDER CORRECT. TWENTY FOURTH NINE FOUR THOUSAND IS GONNA GO TO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SO WITH. A FIVE FOLD INCREASE. WELL THAT'S OVER THE TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND IS BEEN A LONG STANDING- THE AMOUNT THAT WAS KIND OF USED AS A DETERRENT. THE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AS I LAID OUT IS AT THIS POINT THE STATE WILL BE PAYING COUNTIES TO. FOR THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MAINTAINING THOSE YEARS. THAT IF THEY SEND A YOUTH TO DJJ AT THAT POINT NOW WEARING CURRENT NOT COST FOR SOMEONE THAT WE ASK THAT ARE THAT WE ARE PAYING THEM TO COVER. A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IS HELPING THE STATE RECOUP A PORTION OF THAT COST THAT WE HAVE ALREADY PACKED PAPER THAT WE'VE BEEN ON THAT WERE DISTRIBUTED TO THE COUNTY. SO IT'S DIFFERENT IT'S A DIFFERENT FISCAL STRUCTURE BECAUSETHE TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND RELATED TO YOU'VE JUST COMING TO THE STATE AND WAS A SEPARATE. AT YOU KNOW DISINCENTIVE PROGRAM A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND JUST AS A WAY OF SAYING. YES WE WANT TO STILL MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T GO TO THE ADULT SYSTEM SO FOR A PERIOD OF TIME WE WANT THEM TO COME TO DJJ AT THEY DON'T HAVE PROGRAMS READY LOCALLY. BUT SINCE WE'RE ALREADY PAYING YOU FOR THAT USE- WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO RECOUP SOME PORTION OF THAT COST GIVEN THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE THE ONE WHO'S HOUSING AND CARING FOR THEM. CHAPTER FOUR TWENTY TWO HUNDRED TURN THE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE THIS PROGRAM. IN THE OFFICE OF YOU THINK COMMITTEE REAP RESTORATION TO THE OMBUDSMAN. WHO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO INVESTIGATE AND DETERMINE OUTCOMES THESE COMPLAINTS. HOW DOES THIS CONFLICT WITH OUR CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS POLICY AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY LABOR. CONTRACTS WHICH ARE LEGALLY BINDING. SO THE YOUNG BATSMAN IS. HERE IS BEING ESTABLISHED LIKE MANY OTHER ON THAT DEMAND AND I'M TO BE AN ADVISER IN AN ADVOCACY ROLE IT DOES NOT HAVE ENFORCEABLE INVESTIGATIVE AUTHORITY AND CANNOT SUBPOENA SO WE DON'T REALLY WE DON'T SEE THIS AS LIKE A- A SEPARATE- INSPECTOR GENERAL OR SOMETHING WITH. A LOT MORE OF THE- WE SEE THIS AS A ROLE I CAN HELP. TAKEN COMPLAINTS RESOLVED COMPLAINTS- REFER COMPLAINTS. AND TRY TO REMEDY THOSE THE BEST THE- WAY POSSIBLE IN A MORE STRUCTURED CLEAR REPORTING SYSTEM. MOVING FORWARD SO THAT FOLKS- ARE ABLE TO SEE THEIR ISSUES- SALT. SODIUM BUSSMANN DOESN'T INVEST. INVESTIGATES COMPLAINTS OKAY AND JUST ONE MORE THING I TALKED ABOUT LAST WEEK I'M NOT IN LABOR THE POINT BUT- YOU STILL HAVEN'T RECONCILED. DJS PROGRAM FOR SEX OFFENDERS. THAT WE KNOW IS TOP NOTCH. AND THE REASON I GOT TOP NOTCH IS BECAUSE OF THIS I MEAN DIDN'T SUIT IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER THE YEARS. SO YOU WERE TOP NOTCH PROGRAM HERE YOU'RE GOING TO COUNTIES. SO THE COUNTIES GETTING SOME MONEY. BUT BUT THERE'S DJJ OR CORRECTIONS THEY'VE BEEN SUED TO HELL AND BACK. AB ONE H NINE. IF YOU LOOK AT IT. IS RESULT IN THE SAME THING FOR THE COUNTY THE COUNTY BEING SUED BY THE PRISON LAW OFFICE FOR. MEDICAL OR HEALTH CARE IN OTHER ISSUES- SITE CARE THINGS LIKE THAT THAT. EXPOSE THE STATE TO ANOTHER BEING EXPOSED SO MY QUESTION IS. WHAT IS A RUSSIAN NUMBER TWO. AND WE BETTER OFF SERVING THESE KIDS LETTING STAY WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT BILL WORKS ITS EFFECTIVE AS TRIED AND PROVEN. OR SITTING IN THE COUNTIES WHERE I SAID IF YOU WILL NOT IS NOT BEEN A SUCCESS WITH THE COULD THE RECIDIVISM RATE AS HIGH AS HELL- THE GOVERNOR OR HIS STAFF CAN EVEN TELLS WE SAID AS A RAISE FOR THE COUNTIES SO. WILL HAPPEN THESE KIDS GOING TO COUNTIES- OR THEIR LIVES WILL BE BETTER. I YES DEFINITELY I THINK THAT'S THE INTENT OF THE PROPOSAL HERE IS THAT- THE COUNTIES HAVE MADE A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS- UNDER THAT TWO THOUSAND SEVEN REALIGNMENT- THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT SAYS THAT- YOU'D DO BETTER WHEN THEY'RE CLOSE TO THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. SO THAT WAS SORT OF THE INTENT OR PURPOSE BEHIND THIS PROPOSAL. AS FAR AS- THE SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT PROGRAM WE'VE BEEN IN DISCUSSION WITH COUNTIES FOR MONTHS AOUT. WHETHER THEY THINK THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY OR ABILITY TO ROUGHLY. SOMETHING AND TAKE ON THESE CHALLENGES WITH AND GIVEN THAT TRACK RECORD THEY DO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT THEY CAN DO THAT. SO THAT'S WHY WE'VE INCREASED OUR AMOUNT PER YOU FROM THOUSAND. WE HAVE A START UP GRANT OF NINE POINT SIX MILLION THAT'S RELATED TO PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. AS IT RELATES SPECIFICALLY TO SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT. THAT THEIR- THERE'S A SMALL NUMBER OF YOUTH THAT. ARE AT DJJ FOR THOSE TIMES. MAINTENANCE AND IT'S NOT REALLY EXPECTATIONS AND OUR CONVERSATIONS THAT EACH COUNTY WOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF A SPECIALIZED PROGRAM LIKE THAT. THE START UP GRANTS WOULD PROBABLY BE TARGETED AT A COUPLE COUNTIES I FEEL LIKE TO HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO ACTUALLY DO THAT PROGRAM WELL. AND AN ESTABLISHED SYSTEM STRUCTURES AROUND THAT AND THEN WORK WITH THEIR NEIGHBORING COUNTIES. THROUGH THEIR STUFF. RELATIONSHIPS TO PROVIDE THAT TYPE OF CARE. SO THAT'S WHY WE WORK HOW WE THINK THIS WILL WORK LONG TERM- AS FAR AS WHY NOW- THAT BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL SYSTEM NEED CERTAINTY ON THIS ISSUE. AND THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT REFORM. IT IS A SAD THIS BUDGET. IS A LONG TERM IMPLEMENTATION. JULY ONE WE ARE NOT SHIFTING ALL EIGHT YOU THE DJ. CAL IS IT'LL BE A SLOW EMPLOYMENT. HAS CASES ARE ADJUDICATED OVERTIME AND SO WE'RE WE'RE THINKING IT'LL BE AT LEAST OVER FOUR YEARS FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM. AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS. AND MODIFY PROPOSED ARE PROPOSED AS WE LEARN NEW THINGS AND NEED TO PAY FOR IT. SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT START NOW GIVEN THAT UNCERTAINTY ON BOTH ENDS AND- IT DEFINITELY THERE'S TIME TO. ADDRESS ISSUES AS THEY ARISE OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS MY LAST QUESTION IS A BIG COUNTIES MAY BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS AND DEAL WITH IT. BUT A LOT OF SMALL COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THE MONEY TO DEAL WITH THIS. SO THE ELOISE. ALAMEDA'S THE CENSUS OF THE BIG COUNTIES CAN DO THAT. BUT FOR THOSE KIDS THAT GO TO A SMALL COUNTIES THAT DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES. OR THE CAPACITY. TO IMPROVE THESE KIDS LIVES. TO ME THE MONEY'S NOT GOING TO BE THERE HASN'T BEEN THERE THEY DON'T HAVE AFFECTED PROGRAMS. AND YEAH YOU WANT TO SIT ON HOLD BECAUSE THE FAMILIES. BUT I CAN'T GET THE PROPER TREATMENT. WE'RE SAYING THIS THIS ENTIRE PROGRAM IS SET UP FOR FAILURE FOR MOST THE COUNTY WAS NOT LARGE. COUNTIES AND DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY. SO IT DOES THE RULE COUNTIES BEEN A CONCERN OR REPORT OF A POINTOF. TIME OUR CONVERSATIONS AND I THINK. THEY DO HAVE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS AMONGST EACH OTHER AND AS I DESCRIBE I THINK IT'S WORKING THOSE THINGS THOSE THINGS OUT ABOUT. IF THEY HAVE A YOUTH THAT COMMITS A SERIOUS SEX OFFENCE THE NEEDS. AND ALL OF A SPECIALIZED TREATMENT WHERE WOULD THEY GO ABOUT DOING THAT IN SOME KIND OF REGIONAL FORMAT. AND SO- YOU KNOW WITH TIME I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO WORK THAT OUT AND IT'S NOT THE EXPECTATION. OF THE STATE I THINK OR EVEN LOCALLY THAT THEY WOULD THEY WOULD BUILD THEIR PROGRAMS IN SUCH A WAY. THAT THAT'S REALLY A WISHFUL RESPONSE. BECAUSE ALTHOUGH SMALL COUNTIES WE GATHER SO IT CAN POOL RESOURCES BUT STILL GOING TODAY. IT'S STILL A VERY. LIMITED AMOUNT OF RESOURCES A SMALL COUNTIES HAVE SO. THEY CAN PUT TOGETHER MAKE IT EFFECTIVE. AND I WERE I REFER COUNTY FOR THIRTY YEARS SO. IT'S TOUGH FOR THE SMALL COUNTIES OUT THERE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS START WORK. YES I WANT TO- BASICALLY THANK THOSE WHO BEEN WORKING TO TRY O COME TO SOME CONCLUSION AND RESOLVE THE ISSUE- WITH REGARDS TO THE RELATIONSHIP. USE ME WITH THE COUNTIES IN THE AND THE KIND OF OVERSIGHT THAT'LL BE CENTRAL- TO MAKE THIS EFFECTIVE PROGRAM SO I'M WAS SUPPORTIVE OF THE NEW LANGUAGE THAT'S COME OUT. WITH REGARDS TO THAT- WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT PROBABLY IF WE HAD A VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM OF FOR DJJ WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE TOUCHING IT AT THIS POINT- BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE DO HAVE A LOT OF RECIDIVISM MEDIC EXISTEN DJJ. AND SO THE HIGH LEVEL OF STUDENTS RETURNING- AND BASICALLY ALMOST BUILDING A PIPELINE TO PRISON IS UNACCEPTABLE OF THE ADVOCATES WHO WORK DIRECTLY WITH THESE KIDS WHO ARE A PART OF A HOST OF COMMUNITY PROGRAMS AS WELL AS- SOME OF THOSE WHO ARE ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAMS ARE SUPPORTIVE OF US. BASICALLY MAKING THE- THE MOVEMENT AWAY FROM WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE A BIT OF PUTTING IT BACK TO THE COUNTIES AND IN A MUCH EASIER WAY FOR KIDS TO HAVE ACCESS. ONLY AND FOR THE FAMILIES ALSO HAVE SIMILAR ACCESS TO PROGRAMS THAT RELATE TO THE KIDS- WE KNOW THERE ARE SMALL COUNTIES AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE SAID ALSO THAT. YOU KNOW THAT ARE OF A PERSON'S ZIP CODE SHOULD NOT DETERMINE THE SERVICES THAT THEY RECEIVE THAT THEY RECEIVE FROM AND FROM THERE- FROM THE COUNTIES AND SO THE WORK WILL BE UPON THE COUNTIES AS WELL AS THE ADVOCATES TO BASICALLY MAKE SURE. THAT EVERY CHILD HAS THE RIGHT PLACEMENT WITH REGARDS TO WHAT SERVICES THEY MAY NEED BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE DO NOT HAVE QUOTE UNQUOTE A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM AS SUCH IT MAY BE SUCCESSFUL TO SOME. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF RECIDIVISM IN YOUNG PEOPLE'S PROGRAMS WE CAN'T TOLERATE THAT WE HAVE TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE AND THAT- WE ARE NOT JUST SIMPLY FEEDING THE NEXT LEVEL OF INCARCERATION- THAT WE SOMETIMES SEE SO- I KNOW IT'S BEEN A JOURNEY FOR EVERYBODY WHO'S BEEN WORKING ON A VERY APPRECIATIVE OF ALL THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE GONE INTO THIS BECAUSE IT'S NOT BEEN AN EASY ONE. AND WE KNOW THIS IS NOT A QUICK FALL DISCUSSION BECAUSE OF THE FACT IT'S TAKEN US TO A TWO YEARS OR MORE TO GET TO THIS POINT WHERE WE ARE WITH REGARDS TO THE TRANSFER THAT'S THE IT- THE WORD CAME OUT INITIALLY AND EVERYBODY WAS. ALL EXCITED BUT REALIZE THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF. DETAILS I NEED TO BE WORKED OUT AND WE STILL. MORE TO BE WORK OUT WITH REGARDS TO MAKING SURE. THAT THE DECISIONS WE MAKE WITH THE GARDEN YOUNG PEOPLE IS A GOOD DECISION SO. YOU KNOW ALL THE RESEARCH AND INFORMATION SHOWS THAT THIS IS THAT THIS WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE A WHILE TO MOVE IT IT DOESN'T MOVE EASILY AND WE KNOW TO TAKE THREE TO FOUR YEARS BEFORE WE ACTUALLY. SEE FULL IMPLEMENTATION. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK DR GRANT. OTHER COMMENTS COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR ME OTHER FOR FINANCE OR ALEJO- MY UNDERSTANDING IS. THAT THE CURRENT POPULATION OF THE JUDGES JUST A LITTLE BIT SHORT OF EIGHT HUNDRED IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IT THAT IS CORRECT IN MY MIND OR STANDING WAS THAT. THE YOUTH WHO ARE IN THE CURRENT POPULATION AREN'T BEING MOVED THE BILL REALLY IS IMPACTING THE POPULATION AS THEY COME INTO THE SYSTEM. YES DEFINITELY DEFINITELY INITIALLY I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A LONGER TERM COMMERCE CONVERSATION OF DJJ GETS REALLY SMALL BUT THAT'S MANY YEARS OUT. GOT SPENT THE DAY BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE REALLY DISCUSSING IS AS WE DO DJJ INTAKE OF THE- THREE HUNDRED OR SO YOU THINK YEAR- WHERE WHERE ARE THEY GOING. IS THAT CORRECT. AND TO OTHERS. THE COUNTY'S MAIN OPPOSITION OR CONSTERNATION HASN'T REALLY BEEN ABOUT. WHETHER OR NOT THE PROGRAM IS WORKING OR NOT HASN'T REALLY BEEN ABOUT MONEY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. HI YEAH I MEAN I THINK IT'S THEIR CONCERN TO MAKE THE PROGRAM- OPERATE IN A IN A WAY THAT WORKS FOR THEM LONG TERM AS WELL. YES FINDINGS BEEN OF THAT- AND AT LAKE AND SORT OF LIKE HOW ON HOW WE CAN STRAIN THEIR ABILITY TO OPERATE THEIR PROGRAMS HAS BEEN A CONCERN YEAH. RIGHT BUT IT BUT AREN'T AREN'T THE REASON THEY COUNTIES ARE SUCH FINANCIAL. STREETS REGARDING- PUBLIC FIFTIES BECAUSE THEY MADE VERY POOR DECISIONS. BUILT EVEN ALL FACILITIES THAT ARE NEARLY EMPTY MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE OCCUPANCY OF THESE JUVENILE JAILS ACROSS THE COUNTIES LIKE ROUGHLY BY CURRENT FACILITIES ARE FILLED AT A VERY LOW RATE COMPARED TO THEIR OWN CAPACITY YES AND NO ONE IS EXPENSIVE YOU GOT EMPTY. GOT EMPTY JAILS LOT OF PEOPLE GETTING. YOU KNOW PAID ON THE PRISON GRAVY TRAIN. AND YOU KNOW THERE'S NO YOU KNOW WHAT'S WHAT'S VERY CONCERNING. IN TERMS OF FEEDBACK FROM THE COUNTIES NO NOBODY TALKED ABOUT. THE KIDS THE EIGHT HUNDRED KIDS I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT. WHETHER THIS WAS GOOD FOR THE KIDS ARE BAD FOR THE KIDS HE WAS GONNA IN FACT HE WAS REALLY ABOUT HEY GIVE US THE MONEY IT WILL TAKE THE MONEY AND WE DON'T WANT ANY OVERSIGHT. SO IT'S UNFORTUNATE FROM THE COUNTY POINT OF VIEW. THAT THEY WANT TO STAND BEHIND A FAILED PROGRAM DR WEBER TALKED ABOUT IT. THREE OUT OF FOUR YOUTH GET RE ARRESTED. SO THAT THE 25% SUCCESS RATE. YOU GOT A TWENTY TO THIRTY IT'S AUGUST TWENTY FIVE LIKE AMERICAN NUMBER YOU GOT A 25% SUCCESS RATE YOU GOT A 25% ROUGHLY OCCUPANCY. AND YOU GOT COUNTY'S BLEEDING MONEY ON THESE EMPTY JAILS LOOKING FOR THE STATE THE BILL ABOUT. AND I THINK THE STATE IS TIRED OF THIS FAILURE ON THE COUNTY'S PART. SO WE HAVE COME UP WITH THE SYSTEM. THAT WE THINK IS ARE BETTER GOING TO WORK. AND ON TOP OF IT YES- MICHAEL IF NO GROUP IS CORRECT WE'RE GONNA HAVE. A LITTLE BIT OVERSIGHT AND I KNOW THEY ARE FIGHTING THIS TOOTH AND NAIL BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY WANT THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER YOUTH THAT'S WHAT THEY WANTED THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE GETTING I'M GETTING MY HEAD SHAKE THAT'S WHAT THE COUNTIES UNDER SO I'M JUST PUTTING UP WITH THE COUNTIES WANT. THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER USE. THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YOUTH WE SAID NOTED THAT WE'RE GIVING THEM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR AND THEY'RE SAYING IT'S NOT ENOUGH. SO I KIND OF FEEL LIKE ENOUGH IS ENOUGH BECAUSE IF WE CAN GET. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT INTO SUB TO. YOU TALK ABOUT A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF PROGRAM. AND SO FOR ME. I THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THE 25% SIX US RATE THAT IS A COMPLETE FAILURE. WE CAN DO BETTER THAN TO HAVE THESE EMPTY JAILS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ACROSS THE COUNTY TO BLEED MONEY. AND BOY IF THE COUNTIES CAN'T FIGURE OUT. HOW TO HELP THESE. EIGHT HUNDRED OR SO YOUTH AT A PRICE OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YOU. MAYBE WE NEED SOME NEW LEADERSHIP IN THE COUNTIES. DOCTORS BOND LIKELY FROM SAN FRANCISCO NUMBER ONE ONE THE REASONS THE JUVENILE HALLS ARE EMPTY NOW AND THIS THIS IS REAL IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN THERE TALK TO PEOPLE. IF YOU RAPE SOMEBODY YOU GET OUT THE SAME DAY SO YOU COULD ASK GROUP SOMEONE YOU GO BACK TO SCHOOL YOUR CLASS AND SAY PERSON YOU RAPED. IF YOU SHOOT SOMEONE YOU DON'T KEEP YOUR BECAUSE THE JUVENILE HALL ANYMORE IF YOU ROB SOMEBODY WITH A GUN THEY DON'T KEEP AND BECAUSE YOU DO A WHOLE ANYMORE SO A LOT OF FOLKS DEPENDING ON WHAT YOUR FLAVOR THE DAY IS IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH A RAPIST BEING LET OUT AND IT DOES HAPPEN MOST KIDS. THAT'S OKAY REALIGNMENT FOR THE COUNTY JAILS. BEEN HORRIBLE. RECIDIVISM THE COMMISSION SCHOOL YOU HOPE. SCHOOL IN HIS NAME. AND A LOT OF IT COMES BACK TO SOCIETY. AND TO FIX A SOCIETY NOT AFFECT HIS COMMITTEE. BUNNIES NEIGHBORHOODS. UNDERPERFORMING SCHOOLS NO BANKS NO SUPERMARKETS NORTH PROGRAMS SPORTS PROGRAMS FOR KIDS SO THERE'S A PRISON SCHOOL PIPELINE BUT IT INVOLVES A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN THIS. BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS. AB ONE OH NINE REALIGNMENT FAIL. THIS IS A MINI VERSION OF THAT. AND IT'S NOT GONNA MAKE IT BETTER AND THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF THE THINGS TO FIX THEIR PRIMARILY KIDS OF COLOR. SO UNTIL SOMEONE GOES MOST NEIGHBORHOODS IT HAS THE GUTS TO FIX WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT. IT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE. BECAUSE THE SAME THINGS BEEN GOING ON THIRTY FORTY FIFTY YEARS AND HAS NOT CHANGED THE DOWNTOWN REDEVELOPMENT US WE TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS BUT WE DO TAKE CARE OF OUR KIDS HELLO WE HAVE A TAKING CARE OF THEM FOR YEARS THAT HS NOT CHANGED SO THIS IS pJUST LIKE AB ONE OH NINE WAS ABSOLUTELY 1% BELIEVE IN IT. I THOUGHT I THOUGHT IMPLEMENTED. AND ADMINISTRATION STILL CAN'T TELL ME IN FINANCE. WHAT WAS THAT OF THE RATE IS FOR THE COUNTY JAILS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO IDEA. THAT'S ATROCIOUS IT'S ACCEPTABLE TO THE STAFF THAT'S A SINGLE TEST. FOR I MEAN I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM. HELP GROWTH THAT THE SYSTEM IS COMPLETELY BROKEN. THERE'S NO QUESTION. AND I THINK WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN ACCEPT THAT THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN. AND JUST. KEEP GOING. OR WE CAN TRY TO CHANGE. AND I THINK THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO ACKNOWLEDGE- THE FAILURE THAT IT THE SYSTEM IS WHICH I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE GROUP THAT THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED. AND THIS IS A APPROACH TO TRY TO CHANGE THAT. AND WHAT IS THE APPROACH WITH THE APPROACH IS TO ENSURE THAT THE- YOU ARE. IN THERE ARE CLOSER TO THEIR FAMILIES CLOSER TO COUNTY'S WHICH WE'VE SEEN OVER TIME IS- OVERALL A BETTER SITUATION ALSO WE WANT TO HAVE ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT I THINK PART OF THE REASON WE HAVE SUCH A FAILURE NOT JUST FROM THE U. SIDE BUT WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOT TO THE ADULT CORRECTIONS ON IT BECAUSE A COMPLETE. ACKO FOR ACCOUNTABILITY COMPLETE LACK OF OVERSIGHT THE MONEY'S BEEN SPENT IT WAS JUST MONEY GOING HERE MONEY GO ON THERE NO ONE TALKING ABOUT WHERE THE MONEY WENT HOW GOT SPENT WHAT WHAT% WAS. HAPPENING IN FACT. THE DOCTOR WEBER AND I WE FOUGHT HARD. OF THE LEGISLATURE NOT JUST US BUT YOU KNOW WE WITH OUR LEGISLATIVE COLLEAGUES. FOUGHT HARD FOR THE INSPECTOR GENERAL THE CORRECTIONS SYSTEM. IF IT WASN'T FOR THE- INSPECTOR GENERAL. ACTUALLY LOOKING AT MANY OF THE ISSUES IN THE LARGER CORRECTION SYSTEM- WE WOULD NOT BE SEEING MANY OF THE IMPROVEMENTS HETHER HE WAS AROUND COVERT- WHETHER IT WAS AROUND SOME OF THE- PRACTICES THAT WERE HAPPENING IN VARIOUS. FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE. AND THAT'S WHAT AND THAT'S WHAT THE SERBS DID THIS IS ABOUT NOT. AGAIN UNEXPECTED GENERAL BUT AGAIN PROVIDING SOME SUNSHINE ON A SYSTEM THAT ABSOLUTE IS NOT WORKING WE COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. THING AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO SB. EIGHT TO FOUR. NEARLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR WOOD AS OF JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE ELIMINATE THE ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION OF AROUND. TWENTY CRIMINAL JUSTICE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES GENERALLY RELATED TO ALTERNATIVE TO INCARCERATION PROGRAMS- ARRESTING AND BOOKING AND INDIGENT DEFENSE.

THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FINANCE.

THANK YOU FINANCE. GOOD MORNING J. CHAMBERLAND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I HAVE OF I REALLY HAVE NOTHING TO ADD ABOUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU HI MISTER MONTE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR UP PROBABLY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO UNLIKE OTHER ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS EITC DEPENDS ON THE EXISTENCE OF EARNED INCOME AND- THE QUESTION IS- JUST WHAT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD BE ABLE TO- WITH ONLY AND I TEN AND NOT A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER VERIFY THAT THE- THAT THE EARNED INCOME EXISTS. IF A QUESTION ARISES AROUND ELIGIBILITY. YES THANKS FOR THE QUESTION. YES IT AND HANDLE SENSUALLY IN ALL CASES THEY WILL HAVE THE SAFETY ABILITY TO VERIFY THE INCOME AND THERE WILL BE SOME DIFFICULTIES- IN PARTICULAR% CASES IF A TAXPAYER HASN'T. HASN'T MADE CROSS FILE RETURN FOR THE PAST COUPLE YEARS AND DOES NOT HAVE A WAGE INCOME THAT CASE. FRANCHISE TAX WOULD BE NEED TO DO SOME ADDITIONAL- OF VERIFICATION OF INCOME WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE LANGUAGE IN THERE THEY THEY CAN SEND THAT OUT ABILITY TO. TO ASK FOR ADDITIONAL- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HOWEVER A WE DO THINK THAT THAT IS THAT'S CAN BE A REAL MINORITY OF CASES REPORTED THEY WOULD NEED TO DO THAT. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. AND LASTLY NOT A QUESTION MOREOF A COMMENT THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF BILLS THAT FALLS INTO THE CATEGORY OF SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED. FOR YEARS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT I THINK IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE THAT WE ARE INTRODUCING IT FIRST OF ALL IN BUDGET FORM. BUT SECOND OF ALL- AS AN AMENDMENT TO A BILL THREE DAYS BEFORE THE END OF THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION ONE THERE IS NO CHANCE FOR US TO HAVE A DELIBERATE OF DEBATE ABOUT IT. THERE'S NO CHANCE FOR THE PUBIC TO WEIGH IN ON IT- IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO COST THE STATE POTENTIALLY A LOT OF MONEY. AND I THINK THAT WE OWE OUR PUBLIC THE TRANSPARENCY TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR THE ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST IT UNFORTUNATELY THAT TIME IS JUST NOT HERE. THANK YOU. COMMENTS DR ED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I AM GLAD TO SEE S. B. EIGHT THIRTY ONE COME BEFORE US TODAY BECAUSE IT'S A SIGNAL FROM OUR STATE THAT WE ANSWERED THE CALL FROM OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES FOR US TO INVEST IN EQUITY AND TO PURPOSELY MOVE AWAY FROM POLICIES THAT INADVERTENTLY. OR INTENTIONALLY CAUSE HARM THE FULL INCLUSION OF BY TENS IN EACH COW E. I. T. C. WILL HELP US BALANCE THE SCALES OF ECONOMIC JUSTICE FOR FAMILIES WHO UP TO THIS POINT HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OF RECEIVING TAX CREDITS FOR THEIR LABORS THIS WILL PUT MONEY BACK INTO THE POCKETS ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN IT IS MOST NEEDED AND THIS WILL BE A WELCOME RELIEF AS THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST IF NOT THE BEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU DOCTOR AND I WOULD LIKE TO JUST. CLARIFY WE HAVE DONE. A NUMBER OF. EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT EXPANSIONS OVER THE LAST. NUMBER OF YEARS AND THEY'VE ALL BEEN DONE THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET PROCESS I YEAH I DO APPRECIATE MY BY OUR FOSTER'S COMMENTS THAT- THE TRADITIONALLY WERE DONE IN JUNE THIS ONE IS DONE OUT LATER IN THE YEAR. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO GO BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES- JUST GOING BACK TO MY VOICE OUR PROVIDERS QUESTION. IS DO YOU ANTICIPATE ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SELF EMPLOYED THAT'S WHERE THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GONNA FIND POTENTIAL ISSUES. DO YOU WANT TO DO YOU'LL IDENTIFY ANY MORE DIFFICULTY IDENTIFYING INCOME THAN ANY OTHER SELF EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS. I. ALL IN MOST CASES PROBABLY NOT- I'M I I'M ACTUALLY TO HAVE A HARD TIME RIGHT NOW THINKING OF WHAT- WHAT THE DIFFICULTY MIGHT BE- I THINK- YEAH I THINK FOR SELF EMPLOYED I THINK YOU YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU WHETHER YOU'RE SELF EMPLOYED WITH AND I TEN. OR WITH A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. ARE THERE WOULD BE A NEED TO GET SOME SORT OF ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION. FROM THE TAXPAYER TO VERIFY THAT THE THAT THEY REALLY DOWNTURN THAT INCOME. I JUST IMAGINE THAT YOU WE MUST HAVE MILLIONS I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER OF THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO. SELF REPORT INCOME MEANING THEY DON'T GET A W. TWO. LIKE THOSE OF US WHO ARE EMPLOYEE PLEASE- AND THAT THE- BOARD. HAS A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE PROCESS HOW WOULD VERY. THAT INCOME. FOR ALL OF THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE SELF REPORTING INCOME. THAT'S CORRECT NOT TO MENTION THE BEEN DOING THAT FOR DECADES. WELL I THINK SENT CEASE AND SEE- CREATION OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT THEY HAVE ME- TYPICALLY. IT'S IN THE SENSE IT'S REFUNDABLE CREDIT IT'S MORE OPEN TO- TO IMPROPER PAYMENTS- AS OPPOSED TO JUST OFFSETTING TAX SO I THINK THERE'S BEEN A HEIGHTENED EFFORT HAD VERIFIED THAT INCOME SENSE- WE CREATED THE INCOME TAX CREDIT. GOT A SO YOU'RE YOU'RE ACCESSING THAT THE FRANCHISE TAX PROPOSED SPENDS MORE TIME VERIFYING. THESE INDIVIDUALS INCOMES AND THEY WOULD A TYPICAL TAXPAYER THAT IS MINOR YES I CAN'T I'M NOT CERTAIN OF THAT BUT THAT'S UNDERSTANDING HER OKAY THANK YOU. ANY OF. ALL COMMENTS QUESTIONS IF NOT LET'S MOVE TO SB. EIGHT THREE TWO. CAROLYN CHILDREN FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE S. B. AT EIGHT THIRTY TWO WOULD AFFECT THE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION THE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION PROTECTS THE VALUE OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S HOME IN THE EVENT OF BANKRUPTCY. AT THIS BILL WOULD INCREASE THAT PROTECTION TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OR THE MEDIAN SALE PRICE OF A HOME IN THAT COUNTY. I WITH A CAP OF SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THE BILL ALSO WOULD ADDRESS THESE AMOUNTS- FOR INFLATION GOING FORWARD. BUT THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU TO PROVIDE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- NO FURTHER COMMENTS BUT HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER ROGERS. ALL RIGHT I HAVE TO ASK A LAST THE L. A. O. SINCE YOU'RE THE ONES PRESENTING THE BILL UP WHAT ON EARTH DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE BUDGET. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING SIR THAT THIS IS A TRAILER BILL THE BUDGET DOES CONTAIN. VARIOUS PROTECTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS RELATED TO THE- RELATED TO COPE IT- AND PROVIDES. EXPANSION OF ECONOMIC PROTECTIONS. THAT WE WERE NOT INVOLVED IN THE- CRAFTING OF THIS LEGISLATION SO I WOULD BE. REFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR FURTHER DETAILS. ALL RIGHT ALL ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHAT ON EARTH DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE BUDGET. YES CRISCO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT AS THE L. A. O. DID THAT THIS HAS A NEXUS WITH KOBE TO PROVIDE SOME PROTECTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS- WHO WHO MAY BE FORCED FIVE. INTO BANKRUPTCY- DUE TO KOBE HARDSHIPS. WELL I WOULD JUST ALSO ADDED THIS IS A LEGISLATIVE REQUEST AND SO AS TO THE DETAILS ABOUT THIS I HAVE NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD. OKAY WELCOME. ME THE ASSERTION THAT ANYTHING WITH THE NEXUS TO COVE IT AUTOMATICALLY BECOMES BUDGET RELATED I THINK IS RIDICULOUS. BUT I MEAN NORMALLY. BUDGET TRAILER BILLS ARE. OF SCORES OF PAGES LONG THIS IS A COUPLE OF SENTENCES. I ORDINARILY WHEN WE TRY TO CALL SOMETHING A BUDGET BILL WE AT LEAST PUT A TOKEN APPROPRIATION IN THERE SO WE CAN LEAVE OUR HANDS AND SAY. WELL LOOK IT'S RELATED THE BUDGET THIS DOESN'T EVEN HAVE THAT SO. AGAIN I AM BITTERLY. THAT A WEIGHTY POLICY ISSUE LIKE THIS IT'S GOING TO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT. ON THE CREDIT MARKETS IN CALIFORNIA IS BEING SHOE HORNED INTO SOMETHING MORE CALLING A BUDGET BILL. AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE PUT INTO PRINT ON FRIDAY THREE DAYS BEFORE THE END OF SESSION. BEING HEARD HERE IN BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE THE DAY BEFORE THE END OF SESSION THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TRANSPARENCY IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS PUBLIC DEBATE. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE OUGHT TO BE SURE RUNNING THROUGH THE LAST MINUTE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A GOOD IDEA FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT. AND IT COMMENTS. YEAH LIKE AGAIN I THINK MY BY SURE MAKES A VERY FAIR POINT I BELIEVE AS OUR L. A. O. ON ARTICULATED THIS IS JUST ABOUT PROVIDING- VERY MODEST- PROTECTIONS FOR A PARTICULAR FOR HOMEOWNERS- AND PROPERTY OWNERS. WHO ARE RISK OF- LOSING THEIR SINGLE FAMILY HOME. BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS- GIVEN THAT THIS IS THE END OF SESSION AND WE'RE GOING TO BE RECESSING WE THOUGHT WE BETTER BETTER TO TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT HOMEOWNERS- PARTICULAR- WE HAVE A SEPARATE TENTATIVE ACTION BUILT IS GOING THROUGH SEPARATE FROM THE BUDGET PROCESS.
