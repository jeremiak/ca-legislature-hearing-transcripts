PROG A BROUGHT THIS PROPOSAL FOR

00:48:42.887 --> 00:48:46.056 region:rollup2
IT AND TWENTY SIXTEEN WE THINK

00:48:44.255 --> 00:48:47.324 region:rollup2
IT'S A EXCELLENT IDEA WE ARE

00:48:46.056 --> 00:48:48.826 region:rollup2
PUTTING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

00:48:47.324 --> 00:48:50.728 region:rollup2
CHECKS AND BALANCES. TO MAKE

00:48:48.826 --> 00:48:52.163 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THE VALUATION WHICH

00:48:50.728 --> 00:48:53.798 region:rollup2
REALLY SETS THE AMOUNT OF THE

00:48:52.163 --> 00:48:55.232 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATION AS GOVERNED BY THE

00:48:53.798 --> 00:48:57.001 region:rollup2

THIS BILL TO MOVE THROUGH WITH.

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:09.380 region:rollup2
IN THE LEGISLATIVE CALENDAR.

00:49:06.944 --> 00:49:11.215 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT THE STATE HAS

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:13.584 region:rollup2
SAID SOME VERY AGGRESSIVE GOALS

00:49:11.215 --> 00:49:14.618 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO GRAINY

00:49:13.584 --> 00:49:16.086 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT AT THE PORTS.

00:49:14.618 --> 00:49:18.322 region:rollup2
BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:49:16.086 --> 00:49:20.324 region:rollup2
WE PRESERVE COMPETITIVENESS.

00:49:18.322 --> 00:49:21.892 region:rollup2
WE ARE SEEING OTHER STATES

00:49:20.324 --> 00:49:23.861 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY INVEST IN THE REPORTED

00:49:21.892 --> 00:49:25.529 region:rollup2
FOR STRUCTURE. WITH THE WITHOUT

00:49:23.861 --> 00:49:27.231 region:rollup2
THE LEVEL OF CLEANLINESS THAT

00:49:25.529 --> 00:49:28.599 region:rollup2
WE'RE ASKING FOR IN THAT WE

00:49:27.231 --> 00:49:30.267 region:rollup2

TO THE SOUTH OF US.

00:50:27.391 --> 00:50:30.294 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE'RE ALSO SEEING

00:50:28.893 --> 00:50:31.562 region:rollup2
ENHANCED ACTIVITY FROM THE

STRESSED AS.

00:51:15.039 --> 00:51:18.943 region:rollup2
A MARINE TERMINAL OPERATOR THE

00:51:17.274 --> 00:51:20.744 region:rollup2
PORTS ARE THEIR LANDLORDS.

00:51:18.943 --> 00:51:22.279 region:rollup2
BUT THE ACTUAL.

00:51:20.744 --> 00:51:24.448 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT OF THE CARGO ARE

00:51:22.279 --> 00:51:26.250 region:rollup2
HANDLED BY PRIVATE. COMPANIES

00:51:24.448 --> 00:51:27.484 region:rollup2
THAT ARE THE LEASE TENETS OF THE

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:28.719 region:rollup2
PORCH

00:51:27.484 --> 00:51:30.120 region:rollup2
SO FOR LEASE TENANTS SAY SSA

00:51:28.719 --> 00:51:31.622 region:rollup2
MARINE.

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.523 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO COME FORWARD AND

00:51:31.622 --> 00:51:34.325 region:rollup2
BILL.

00:51:32.523 --> 00:51:35.960 region:rollup2
OR INSTALL A PIECE OF

00:51:34.325 --> 00:51:37.661 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE OF A CARGO

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:38.662 region:rollup2
HANDLER EQUIPMENT OR QUITE A

00:51:37.661 --> 00:51:39.964 region:rollup2
CRANE THAT CURRENTLY OPERATES

00:51:38.662 --> 00:51:41.231 region:rollup2
UNDER DIESEL.

00:51:39.964 --> 00:51:42.733 region:rollup2
AND WANTED TO MOVE TO SAY AND

00:51:41.231 --> 00:51:44.234 region:rollup2
ELECTRIFIED CREE.

00:51:42.733 --> 00:51:46.337 region:rollup2
BUT THE COST OF THAT.

00:51:44.234 --> 00:51:48.439 region:rollup2
WAS MORE THAN THE POOR COULD

00:51:46.337 --> 00:51:49.773 region:rollup2
JUSTIFY AND THE TENANT BASED ON

00:51:48.439 --> 00:51:51.375 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT ECONOMICS OF THE

00:51:49.773 --> 00:51:52.576 region:rollup2
PRICE OF MOVING CARGO AND THE

00:51:51.375 --> 00:51:54.011 region:rollup2
TARIFF RATES THAT THEY CURRENTLY

00:51:52.576 --> 00:51:55.346 region:rollup2
CHARGE.

00:51:54.011 --> 00:51:56.981 region:rollup2
BUT THEY WANTED TO DO IT THERE

00:51:55.346 --> 00:51:58.482 region:rollup2
WAS A GOAL SET BY THE STATE AND

00:51:56.981 --> 00:52:00.017 region:rollup2
FRANKLY THAT THE PORT AND THE

00:51:58.482 --> 00:52:02.119 region:rollup2
REGIONAL AIR DISTRICT.

00:52:00.017 --> 00:52:04.455 region:rollup2
BUT THAT DIESEL CRANE COULD

00:52:02.119 --> 00:52:06.190 region:rollup2
WORK FOR YEARS.

00:52:04.455 --> 00:52:08.392 region:rollup2
AND HAD ALREADY BEEN PAID FOR IN

00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:10.160 region:rollup2
THE ECONOMIC MODEL THAT EXISTED.

00:52:08.392 --> 00:52:12.796 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD ALLOW THE PORT TO

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:14.598 region:rollup2
COME FORWARD GET EVALUATION HAVE

00:52:12.796 --> 00:52:16.133 region:rollup2
THE EVALUATION VERIFIED BY THE

00:52:14.598 --> 00:52:17.434 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE BANK.

00:52:16.133 --> 00:52:19.670 region:rollup2
HAVE AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT

00:52:17.434 --> 00:52:21.238 region:rollup2
REVIEW IT. HAVE THE PORT MAKE A

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:22.039 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION AND A FINDING THAT IS

00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:23.974 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE HIDE

00:52:22.039 --> 00:52:25.676 region:rollup2
LANDS ACT.

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:26.110 region:rollup2
AND THEN BASED ON A FUTURE

00:52:25.676 --> 00:52:27.444 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATION BY THE

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:28.779 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

00:52:27.444 --> 00:52:30.447 region:rollup2
AS CONFIRMED BY THE CURRENT

00:52:28.779 --> 00:52:32.216 region:rollup2
FINANCE.

00:52:30.447 --> 00:52:33.851 region:rollup2
THE WAR ERA AND APPROPRIATIONS

00:52:32.216 --> 00:52:35.119 region:rollup2
BASED ON EVALUATION.

00:52:33.851 --> 00:52:38.255 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A

00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:39.757 region:rollup2
SEVERAL CHECKS IN THE PROCESS.

00:52:38.255 --> 00:52:41.525 region:rollup2
I JUST ASKED THAT QUESTION

00:52:39.757 --> 00:52:43.627 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IN THIS COMMITTEE WE

00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:45.062 region:rollup2
HEAR LOTS OF TERMINOLOGY AND I

00:52:43.627 --> 00:52:46.664 region:rollup2
WANNA MAKE SURE THAT OUR VIEWERS

00:52:45.062 --> 00:52:47.531 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAVE SO MANY

00:52:46.664 --> 00:52:49.767 region:rollup2
OUT THERE THE STATE OF

00:52:47.531 --> 00:52:51.035 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. ARE FOLLOWING ALONG

00:52:49.767 --> 00:52:53.003 region:rollup2
WITH US AND.

00:52:51.035 --> 00:52:54.538 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING HOW THESE

00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:56.707 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS.

00:52:54.538 --> 00:52:58.676 region:rollup2
I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE NOT

00:52:56.707 --> 00:52:59.643 region:rollup2
ONLY IN OUR ENVIRONMENT BUT ALSO

00:52:58.676 --> 00:53:01.645 region:rollup2
IN OUR AND BECAUSE THEY ARE IN

00:52:59.643 --> 00:53:03.213 region:rollup2
OUR ECONOMY.

00:53:01.645 --> 00:53:04.982 region:rollup2
YEAH SO IT MANAGER RIGHT I BUT

00:53:03.213 --> 00:53:06.517 region:rollup2
THAT INTO PLAIN ENGLISH TO FRAME

00:53:04.982 --> 00:53:07.785 region:rollup2
IT HAPPENS TO BE VIEWING OR ANY

00:53:06.517 --> 00:53:09.720 region:rollup2
MEDIA THAT'S COVERING US.

00:53:07.785 --> 00:53:11.588 region:rollup2
VERY SIMPLY OUR PORTS PAIN

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:12.623 region:rollup2
CONSTANT INVESTMENT TO MAKE SURE

00:53:11.588 --> 00:53:13.590 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE THE BEST PORTS IN

00:53:12.623 --> 00:53:14.792 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THIS IS NOT

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:16.960 region:rollup2
JUST FOR ENVIRONMENT IS ALSO FOR

00:53:14.792 --> 00:53:18.195 region:rollup2
MOVING CARGO. BUT IT ALL RELATES

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.563 region:rollup2
TO CALIFORNIA'S PORTS BEING THE

00:53:18.195 --> 00:53:21.198 region:rollup2
MOST COMPETITIVE PORTS IN THE

00:53:19.563 --> 00:53:23.600 region:rollup2
NATION AND MOST HELIPORTS IN THE

00:53:21.198 --> 00:53:24.535 region:rollup2
WORLD. THIS ALLOWS OUR PORTS TO

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.003 region:rollup2
MAKE THE CORRECT ECONOMIC

00:53:24.535 --> 00:53:27.971 region:rollup2
DECISIONS

00:53:26.003 --> 00:53:29.506 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT OUR REPORTS

00:53:27.971 --> 00:53:31.208 region:rollup2
REMAIN THE MOST COMPETITIVE

00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:32.476 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IN TODAY'S GLOBALIZED

00:53:31.208 --> 00:53:33.744 region:rollup2
ECONOMY IT'S VERY SIMPLE FOR

00:53:32.476 --> 00:53:34.912 region:rollup2

AND THEY CAN BYPASS CALIFORNIA

00:53:37.948 --> 00:53:42.486 region:rollup2
ENTIRELY. THIS SIMPLY GIVES OUR

00:53:54.465 --> 00:53:57.101 region:rollup2

YET ANOTHER STEP AND IT'S

00:54:11.415 --> 00:54:14.852 region:rollup2
ANOTHER POSITIVE IMPACT THE

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:15.953 region:rollup2
