LISTS BRING THIS HEARING. SO ORDER A WELCOME TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT -- WE WILL STEPS A QUORUM SHORTLY BUT WILL BEGIN -- AS A SUBCOMMITTEE -- WE WELCOME SENATOR LARA WHO IS HERE TO PRESENT. S. B.. FOURTEEN OH TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THERE HAS BEEN MANY ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THEM AS CLASSIFICATION AND EXPLOITATION OF PORT TRUCK DRIVERS. BUT TO DATE THESE VULNERABLE DRIVER STILL LACK THE APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS. BUT LET ME GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT FOR WHY S. B. FOURTEEN O. TO IS NEEDED. CALIFORNIA'S PORTS AS YOU KNOW ARE THE POWERHOUSE DRIVING ARCTIC ECONOMY AND CONNECTING US THE WORLD. MORE THAN 40% OF THE U. S. SHIPPING CONTAINER TRAFFIC FLOW THROUGH THE PORT OF LA LONG BEACH AND OAKLAND. THE ESTIMATED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WOMEN AND MEN WHO ALL THESE CARGO CONTAINERS AWAY FROM OUR PORTS HAVE SOME OF THE HARDEST JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY. THE STATE LABOR COMMISSIONER HAS WON MORE THAN FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN JUDGMENTS FOR MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED DRIVERS. NO HIGHER COURT HAS EVER OVERTURNED ANY OF THESE AWARDS APPEAL AND APPEAL. IT'S SAY THESE JUDGMENTS RARELY MATERIALIZE FOR WORKERS AND ARE RARELY MADE WHOLE Y. BECAUSE COMPANIES REFUSE TO PAY THAT REFUSE TO PAY GO OUT OF BUSINESS. AND POP UP UNDER A NEW NAME. SENATE BILL FORTUNE THE TWO WILL CLEAN UP OUR PORTRAIT DRIVING INDUSTRY ONCE AND FOR ALL. S. B. FORTUNATE TO ORDER THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT TO CREATE A LIST OF COMPANIES WITH FINAL JUDGMENTS FOR LABOR VIOLATIONS INCLUDING WAIT STAFF FAILURE TO PAY TAXES AND ILLEGAL DEDUCTIONS. THE COMPANIES ON THIS LIST HAVE EXHAUSTED BUT STILL REFUSE TO PAY DRIVERS WHAT THEY ARE RIGHTFULLY OWED. AS THE FOURTEENTH TWO WILL CONTINUE CALIFORNIA WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIA HOLD RETAIL COMPANIES AND SHIP SHIPPERS LIABLE WHEN THEY HIRE TRUCKING COMPANIES ON THIS LIST. I WANT TO THANK THE OPPOSITION FOR RECOGNIZING THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS ISSUE AND ENGAGING WHAT THAT'S CONSTRUCTIVELY ON THIS BILL. AS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS I INTEND TO MAKE AMENDMENTS IN THE NEXT -- POLICY COMMITTEE BUT ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS REGARDING ALLOWING FOR TIME FOR A CUSTOMER TO TERMINATE AN EXISTING AGREEMENT WITH THE COMPANY ON THE WEBSITE. ESTABLISHING A REGULAR FREQUENCY OF FOR UPDATES OF THE WEBSITE BY THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT. RESPECTFULLY ASK HER ABOUT. THANK YOU I SEE YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF WITNESSES THAT WILL ALLOW TO TEACH IT WILL ALLOW THE SAME FOR THE OPPOSITION PURSUING. A MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS VERY BROAD WITH THE TEAMSTERS WERE SPONSORS OF THE BILL. ON THE MEDIA SAY THAT THIS IS. TERRIBLE PROBLEM. FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS. CREATES A LIST. BOB UNSATISFIED FINAL JUDGMENTS AND RIGHT NOW THERE'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED OF THOSE FROM TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT TRUCKING COMPANIES. ADDING TO ABOUT FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS OWED TO WORKERS THAT IS FUN PAID -- UNDER THE BILL. I IF A TRUCKING COMPANY SHOWS UP ON THE LIST. A SHIPPER HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEVER THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT TRUCKING COMPANY. AND ONLY HAS JOINT LIABILITY UNDER THIS. IF THEY DON'T SEVER THEIR RELATIONSHIP. THE TRUCKING COMPANY AND THE TRUCKING COMPANY FAILS TO SATISFY THE JUDGMENT. AND THE CONTINUE TO VIOLATE THE LAW. WHILE THE DRIVER IS HAULING FREIGHT ON BEHALF OF THAT SHIPPER SO IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. FOR A SHIPPER TO GET TO JOINT LIABILITY IF THEY SIMPLY LOOK AT THE LIST AND GO TO ANOTHER TRUCKING COMPANY AND IT'S EASY FOR TRUCKING COMPANIES TO GET OFF THE LIST IF HAVE UNSATISFIED FINAL JUDGMENTS THEY JUST NEED TO PAY THEIR WHAT THEY OWE THEIR WORKERS. AND THE TAXES THAT THEY OWE TO THE STATE BOB. I WANT TO INTRODUCE OR HEY IT MIGHT WORK OUT.

ARE THE BIGGEST CONCERN WITH THE BILL AND WE UNDERSTAND -- A SENATOR LARA'S -- OVERALL REASONS FOR THE BILL AND I'M WE DO APPRECIATE HIS OFFICE AND SPONSORS WORKING WITH US TO TRY TO GET TO A POSITION WHERE. AND WE CAN WORK ON LANGUAGE TO KIND OF REMEDY SOME OF THESE CONCERNS BUT THEY OUTLINED HER OUTSTANDING CONCERNS I'M CURRENTLY IS THE KNOWLEDGE REQUIREMENT THEY ARE GOING TO BE. JOINTLY LIABLE FOR WAGES DAMAGES AND PENALTIES FOR DRIVERS WHERE THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD A DIRECT CONTRACT WITH THIS MOTOR CARRIER AND THEY JUST DON'T WANT ANY SURPRISE FACTORS THEY DON'T WANT SOMEONE TO POTENTIALLY BE PUT ON THE WEBSITE. THAT THEN THEY DON'T NOTICES ON THE WEBSITE OR NO IT'S ON THE WEBSITE WHERE THEY DID NOT DIRECT CONTRACT WITH THAT INDIVIDUAL ON THE WEBSITE BECAUSE WHILE THERE IS LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT REQUIRES THE MOTOR CARRIER TO NOTIFY. THE CUSTOMER IF THEY ARE ON PUT ON THE WEBSITE OR IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN HOW THE COURT FOR THIS KIND OF ISSUE THAT IS NOT A DEFENSE FOR THAN THE CUSTOMER TO GET OUT OF LIABILITY OR TWO REMEDIED ISSUE AND SO THAT'S WHERE OUR BIGGEST CONCERN IS. IS THAT REALLY THE ONLY NOTICE REQUIREMENT IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT PLACES THESE NAMES ON A WEBSITE AND THEN DIED AND DO THAT RETAILER CUSTOMER HAS NINETY DAYS TO THAN CANCEL THAT CONTRACT. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THE CLARIFYING LANGUAGE JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE EITHER THEY'RE ASKED TO BE A DIRECT CONTRACT RELATIONSHIP OR THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE.

MOTION IS YOU PASSED TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THURMOND AYE AYE THURMAN AYE FLORA GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER AYE KALRA. KALRA AYE REDUCE [inaudible] STEINORTH. IT BUILDS UP REGULATION THANK YOU THANK YOU. I GET THIS SUMMER WELCOME SENATOR JACKSON WILL BE PRESENTING TO BILLS TODAY. S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR AND S. B. THIRTEEN HUNDRED WELCOME SENATOR [inaudible] CALLING SO. THIS IS A A BILL TO FIGHT PAY DISCRIMINATION WITH DATA. WITH INFORMATION THE BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO PAY EQUITY FOR WOMEN AND MINORITIES. WE SIMPLY CAN'T FIX WHAT WE DON'T KNOW. AND AS YOU ALL KNOW. EQUAL PAY. IS AN ISSUE THAT IS VERY CLOSE TO MY HEART AND I WOULD SUSPECT TO THE HEARTS OF EACH WOMAN IN THIS ROOM AND THEN ALSO. MEN WHO HAVE SPOUSES AND PARTNERS AND SISTERS AND MOTHERS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN PAID FAIRLY. FOR THE WORK THEY DO BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER. THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE WITH UNEQUAL PAY IS THAT IT'S SO OFTEN IS HIDDEN. NOT CHOSE TO EMPLOYEES BUT OFTEN TO EMPLOYERS THEMSELVES WELL PAY INEQUITY CONTINUES MOST EMPLOYERS I BELIEVE. TO REALLY NOT INTEND TO SHORT CHANGE THEIR STAFF. AND RECOGNIZING THE PAY DISCRIMINATION IS HARD TO DETECT AND ADDRESS. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED A PROPOSED REVISION TO A DEMOGRAPHIC REPORT. THE LARGE EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTING TO IT A TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS. IT'S CALLED THE EMPLOYER INFORMATION REPORT OR THE E. -- Y.. IT WILL A IT WAS A IT IN -- TWENTY FIFTEEN THE INTENT OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO INCLUDE THE REPORTING OF PAY DATA BY RACE AND GENDER. INTO THAT REPORT BEGINNING IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT IN AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. PUT A HALT TO THIS NEW RULE DEALING A BLOW TO THE FIGHT FOR EQUAL PAY. S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR AIMS TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA COLLECTS THIS IMPORTANT PAY DATA EMPLOYERS WERE ALREADY POSED A POISED AND PREPARED TO START REPORTING. EVEN IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT REQUIRED. MODELED CLOSELY AFTER THE OBAMA ORDER -- S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR WILL REQUIRE EMPLOYERS WITH A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES OR MORE. TO SUBMIT A PAID OUT A REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. OUTLINING THE COMPENSATION AND HOURS WORKED OF EMPLOYEES BY GENDER. RACE ETHNICITY AND JOB CATEGORY. NOW THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WORKED ON THIS PROPOSAL FOR OVER TWO YEARS WHICH STAKEHOLDERS FROM ALL THE VARIOUS GROUPS. SO THIS IS NOT A HURRIED ALL OR HAPHAZARD PROCESS. THE GOAL OF THIS MEASURE IS TWO FOLD ONE TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO ANALYZE THEIR OWN PAY PRACTICES. AND ALLOW FOR SELF CORRECTION PUT A MIRROR IN FRONT OF YOURSELF AND SEE WHAT. IS REFLECTED IN THAT MIRROR. AND VERY FEW EMPLOYERS HAVE DONE THAT. BUT WHEN THEY HAVE DONE THAT THE PRIMARILY VOLUNTARILY. MOST OF THEM HAVE DISCOVERED THAT INDEED THERE ARE PAY INEQUITIES THAT THEY WEREN'T EVEN AWARE OFF. AND BECAUSE I BELIEVE MOST EMPLOYERS DO NOT WANT TO DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS -- PAY A ON THE BASIS OF GENDER THEY HAVE CORRECTED THIS ISSUE. THAT WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE PERFECT GOAL. TO ACHIEVE BY THIS BILL BUT IT ALSO ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS TOGETHER IMPORTANT DATA THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SEE PATTERNS OF WAGE DISPARITIES. AND IF THEY DIDN'T NOTICE DEVIATIONS ARE OUT LIARS THEY WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER. SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BASED UPON SOME OF THE MISINFORMATION THAT IS OUT THERE TO NOTE WHAT THIS BILL IS NOT. THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT PUBLIC SHAMING. AND I HAVE TAKEN AMENDMENTS THAT ENSURE THAT THIS IS VERY CLEAR. IT WILL NOT EXPOSE INFORMATION THAT IS IDENTIFIABLE BY BUSINESS TO THE PUBLIC NOR WILL IT EXPOSED EMPLOYEES PRIVATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC. I'VE TAKEN THE UNUSUAL STEP OF PROHIBITING DISCLOSURE UNDER THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT TO ASSURE THAT. THE LIMITATION ON PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF THE REPORTS IS SIMILAR TO WHAT OCCURS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHERE THEY HAVE HAD NO ISSUES WITH ON TOWARD DISCLOSURE OF THIS DATA IN THE FIFTY PLUS YEARS SINCE THE FORM HAS BEEN REQUIRED. THIS DATA WILL PROVIDE A BIRDS EYE VIEW ON PAY DISPARITIES AND OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION BUT DOES NOT DO SO IN THE GRANULAR WAY THAT COULD BE USED TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS. THE INFORMATION IS NOT INTENDED AND CANNOT BE USED TO ENFORCE THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PAY ACT BECAUSE THAT ACT A A DOES ALLOW FORD. DIFFERENTIALS IN PAY BASED UPON CERTAIN SPECIFIC LEGITIMATE CRITERIA SUCH AS SIMPLY A IT EXPERIENCE EDUCATION AND OTHER ITEMS THAT WOULD. POSSIBLY GENERATED DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT -- AND WE SOMETIMES REFER TO THEM AS BONA FIDE REASONS FOR PAYING ONE EMPLOYER MORE THAN ANOTHER THAT'S NOT ASK FOR A IN THIS REPORT EMPLOYERS WILL NOT BE EXPOSED IN THAT MANNER. THIS BILL RATHER IS A TOOL TO SHED LIGHT ON TRENDS AND THE BIG PICTURE. AND I WILL AND HAVE BEEN CONSULTING WITH THE OPPOSITION. I DON'T KNOW THAT WILL NEVER COME TO A COMPLETE COMMON GROUND BUT MY SENSE IS THAT THERE ARE STILL THINGS WE CAN DO. TO ASSURE THEM AND BE RESPONSIVE TO THEY MAY HAVE ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES NOT DO AND I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THEM -- WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED REQUESTS FROM FOLKS REPRESENTING THE TEMPORARY STAFFING UP OR AGENCY REFERRAL SECTORS TO INCLUDE EXEMPTIONS FOR THEM AND I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THEM IN A BELIEVE A IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF SETTLING ON LANGUAGE OF FOR THAT. TERM. RESULT AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO SOMETHING EVERYTHING WE CAN LIVE WITH EVEN THOSE WHO MIGHT NOT LOVE EVERY ELEMENT OF THIS BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS. EQUAL PAY HAS BEEN THE LAW OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR SEVENTY YEARS. GET RECENT STUDIES PREDICT WE WILL NOT FULLY CLOSE THAT WAGE GAP FOR A HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS IF WE DO NOT TAKE ACTION. 40% OF HOUSEHOLDS HAVE WOMEN AS THEIR SOLE OR PRIMARY BREADWINNERS. SO THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT WOMEN IN FAIRNESS OR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S ABOUT LIFTING UP OUR ENTIRE STATE AND OUR ECONOMY. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY WITNESSES WHO HAVE. BUT WORKING HARD ALONGSIDE OF ME AND MANY OTHERS IN THIS BUILDING TO ACHIEVE THAT. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT EQUAL PAY LEVEL FOR ALL PEOPLE WORKING IN OUR STATE THAT WE ARE BASED ON THE MERITS OF OUR WORK AND NOT OUR GENDER. AND WITH ME ARE -- JESSICA STANDER SENIOR COUNSEL FOR WORKPLACE JUSTICE AND PUBLIC POLICY AT EQUAL WHITE EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES. AND RICO YOSHIHARA WHO IS THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL FOR THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION AND WITH THAT I WOULD ASK YOUR HONOR. YOU CENTER -- WILL HAVE YOU PRESENT YOUR FIRST WITNESS I'D LIKE TO QUICKLY THOUGH IT KNOWLEDGE TO ADD NEW MEMBERS OUT TO THE ASSEMBLY LABOR COMMITTEE RIPLEY'S TO A PRESENT ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVERSE. AND TO WHAT MY PRESENT ASSEMBLY MEMBER STEINORTH WELCOME TO OUR COMMITTEE I EACH WITNESS WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH. PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MURDERS MY NAME IS JESSICA SENATOR I'M SENIOR COUNSEL FOR PLEASE JUSTICE AND PUBLIC POLICY RIGHTS ADVOCATES. OUT WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR WHICH TRIGGERED ADDRESS TWO MAJOR OBSTACLES TO CHIU CLOSING THE GENDER AND RACIAL WAGE GAPS IN THE STATE. OUT ONE IS THE CONCENTRATION OF WOMEN IN MY BODIES AND INDUSTRIES AND ONE IS THE DIFFICULTY OF DETECTING A P. DISPARITIES MP DISCRIMINATION EVEN BY EMPLOYERS THEMSELVES. AS SENATOR JACKSON LAID OUT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION -- IN THE DURING THE PAST MINISTRATION A REVISED THE LONG STANDING E. O. ONE FORM TO TRY TO ADDRESS THESE PAY DISPARITIES IN THE DIFFICULTY OF THIS OF OF DETECTING THEM BY REVISING THEIR E. O. ONE FORM -- I WOULD JUST ELABORATE A BIT ON THE PROCESS THAT THE EEOC TOOK A IN IN IN CHANGING THE FOREMAN AND PROVIDING THESE REVISIONS -- THEY WENT THROUGH TWO YEARS -- TWO PLUS YEARS OF OF INVESTIGATING WHAT WOULD BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE PROCESS TO COLLECT AFFECTED P. DATA IN A WAY THAT WILL BE LEAST BURDENSOME ON EMPLOYERS OTHER WENT THROUGH TWO ROUNDS OF NOTICE AND PUBLIC COMMENT. CONSULTATIONS OF EMPLOYER REPRESENTATIVES STATISTICIANS AT HUMAN RESOURCES INFORMATION SYSTEMS EXPERTS AND THEY CONDUCTED VERY STUDIES ARE INDEPENDENT ENTITIES A TO DETERMINE THE MOST EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE WAY AND THE LEAST COSTLY WAY FOR EMPLOYERS TO COLLECT HIS PAY DATA. AND THEY DETERMINED THAT THIS PROCESS THAT THEY THAT THEY CAME UP WITH AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- AND THAT PROCESS OF PAIDEIA COLLECTION WOULD BE THE LEAST UP BURDEN SOME BUT ALSO THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS FORUM HERE IN OUR BILL EYES MIRRORED ON AS SENATOR JACKSON EXPLAINED. THIS REALLY HELPS EMPLOYERS -- DETERMINE WHETHER MAYBE DISPARITIES IN BUT ALSO WHERE THERE MAY BE WHAT WE REFER TO AS OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION THAT THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN AWARE OF AND THIS HAS COME ABOUT IN THE CUP WITH THE COMPANIES HAVE CHOSEN VOLUNTARILY. DO THESE KINDS OF ANALYSES LIKE SALES FORCE DELTA AND SEVERAL OTHER LARGE COMPANIES THEY FOUND THAT WITHIN THEM WOMEN AND MINORITIES ARE OFTEN FUNNELED INTO THESE LOWER PAID POSITIONS. SEGREGATION PATTERNS EXIST AND MAKE CHANGES ON IN THEIR HIRING AND PROMOTION RETENTION PROP POLICIES SUCH THAT THEY CAN BETTER REPRESENT PEOPLE ALL SPECTRUMS ON THE WAGE SCALE -- AN ADDITION YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM CENTER JACKSON THE AFFIRMATIVE ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS OF THIS WILL HELP OUR STATE AGENCIES WITH TO USE THEIR VERY LIMITED RESOURCES IS CRITICAL I'M HAVING THIS P. DATA AS YOU'VE HEARD IT WON'T BE INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE. IT WON'T BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IT WILL HELP OUR STATE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES USE THE LIMITED TIME AND RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO LOOK FOR BROADER PATTERNS IN INDUSTRIES AND OCCUPATIONS WHERE THEY MIGHT THEN DO A DEEPER DIVE TO DETERMINE IF THERE'S ENFORCEMENT NECESSARY -- ALTERNATE OVER MY COLLEAGUES JENNINGS WITH CROWLEY TO TALK A BIT MORE THE FOR THESE REASONS WE I DO URGE DRIVE VOTE THANK YOU. THINK YOU SHANNON SMITH CALLING ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN FOR CALIFORNIA -- WE DID A LOT THE LAST FEW YEARS THANKS TO CHAT CENTER JACKSON OTHERS. BUT THIS PROBLEM IS SO PERSISTENT WE NEED THIS OTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX. WEEK THERE THE STATISTIC ABOUT WOMEN ARE THE PRIMARY OR SOLE BREADWINNER. THIS MEANS EIGHTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. IN LOST WAGES TO CALIFORNIA WOMEN SO THINK ABOUT HOW MANY WOMEN ARE WORKING ONE OR MORE JOBS AND ARE STILL NEEDING A WHOLE ARRAY OF PUBLIC SERVICES. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GETTING A FAIR WAGE. WE'RE LOOKING THE STUDY SHOWS ONLY ABOUT 6212% OF WEIGHT OF THE WAGE GAP IS DUE TO ACTUAL OUTRIGHT BIAS OR DISCRIMINATION. SOME OF THIS IS HIS JOB SEGREGATION. SOME OF THIS IS NEGOTIATE WOMEN TEND NOT TO NEGOTIATE. AS HEAVILY AS MEN DO ON A EW'S ACTUALLY COMMITTED TO TRAINING TEN MILLION WOMEN ACROSS THE UNITED STATES BY. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO ON WHICH NEGOTIATION OR SELLING GOSHI XIN BUT EVEN WITHOUT THE STUDY SHOW. WOMEN OR NOT RECEIVED THE SAME WAY WHEN WE CAN NEGOTIATE FOR OURSELVES. AS MEN ARE SO THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TO DO. A LOT OF THIS IS. THERE'S JUST THE PERPETUATION OF THE STATUS QUO CAN I'M I LIKEN THIS TO STEPPING ON THE SCALE COULD ONLY GO WE STEP ON THE SCALE BUT IT'S HELPFUL TO BE ABLE TO KNOW. BUDGET TO DO THAT -- ISN'T. THINK OTHER PEOPLE AGREE ARM IN ALSO HOW THE CAN HELP PERVASIVE THIS IS THIS IS ALL WOMEN. ALL RACES ETHNICITIES PROFESSIONS. EVERYTHING FROM FROM YOU KNOW FROM. UNSKILLED WORK TO PROFESSIONAL WOMEN THE LOOKING AT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LOOK CAREER OF A PROFESSIONAL WOMAN THAT SHE DOES NOT MAKE COMPARED TO MEANT. EVEN IN. THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. FEMALE OBGYN SPEAK LESS THE MAIL WILL BE CHAINED LANDS FEMALE NURSES. MAKE LESS THAN MALE NURSES. SO WE NEED TO CLEAR THIS UP IN TO HAPPEN AGAIN OTHER TOOLS ARE TOOLBOX KNOWN WE THIS IS A VITAL TOOL TO HELP EMPLOYERS. SEE FOR THEMSELVES MAKE A CHANGE THANK YOU. GIVE THIS. ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN REYES MARK AREA SHE HIGH WITH THE CALIFORNIA LAWYERS ASSOCIATION ALSO WORKED WITH. AND THE AUTHOR AND THEY CO SPONSORS ON A LOT OF THE THE PAST -- REFORMS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS TO CHECK THEIR EQUAL PAY LAWS WE THINK THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE NEXT STEP I'M AS MY COLLEAGUE POINTED OUT THIS THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT PAY DISCRIMINATES DISCRIMINATION IS ABOUT OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION AS WELL. WE THINK THAT THIS ALLOWS GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE EMPLOYERS TO DO THOSE PAY AUDITS TO TAKE A DEEPER DIVE AND LOOK AT THEIR PAY DATA TO ENSURE THAT. NOT JUST THAT THEY'RE PAYING THEIR WORKERS FAIRLY BUT THE ALSO THE HIRING PRACTICE IN THE PROMOTION PRACTICES ARE FAIR AND EQUITABLE AS WELL. SO STRONG SHOWING THEIR SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION HERE SUPPORT. THANK YOU. LIKELY ON THE HALF DAYS SO YOUR CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT MAKE YOU. JOSH WILL GO WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. GLORIA CHUNK FROM LEGAL AID AT WORK IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MARK SCHACHT OF CRLA FOUNDATION OF SPORT. THEY KEEP IT WOULD ALSO SHOULD ADD ON IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IF THERE'S OPPOSITION WOULD YOU PLEASE COME FORWARD PLEASE PROCEED HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON MARK CURTIS THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND AND YES WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH AUTHOR AND WE APPRECIATE AND THE EFFORTS IN ORDER TO RESOLVE SOME OF THE MORE TECHNICAL ISSUES WITH THE BILL. AND IT JUST A FEW THINGS TO CLARIFY -- FIRST FROM OUR UNDERSTANDING THE EOC -- THE FORM WAS NOT COMPLETELY DONE AT THE TIME AND THAT IT WAS SUSPENDED AT LEAST THE COMMENT PERIOD AND THE CONSIDERATIONS WERE STILL BEING OPEN AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. AMENDED TO ACTUALLY INCLUDE THAT ALL OF THE VERY TECHNICAL ISSUES REGARDING THE W. TWO BOX THAT WAS USED FOR THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE W. TO BOX ONE THE SNAPSHOT PERIOD WOULD BE FROM. OCTOBER TO DECEMBER RATHER THAN AS THE TIMBRE AND SO THOSE ARE KIND OF TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT WERE STILL TAKING UP WITH THE BILL AND WE THIS IS A JOB KILLER FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. AND BECAUSE WHILE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT IS NOT THE PUBLIC SHAMING WE ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS STILL WILL BE TO PUBLIC SHAMING BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING SHALL NOT MAKE FISH IT IT WOULD BE UNLAWFUL FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING TO MAKE. THIS INFORMATION PUBLIC ARE I MEAN YES TO MAKE IT AND BAD PUBLIC. PRIOR TO THE INSTITUTION OF LITIGATION UNDER EITHER THE FAIR PAY ACT OR THE GOVERNMENT CODE SO ONCE A LITIGATION IS AND COMMENCE THEN THE INFORMATION COULD BE TURNED OVER BY THE DEPARTMENT. AND THAT IS A STRONG CONCERN FOR US AND ADDITIONALLY OVERALL ARE CONCERNED WITH THE ISSUE IS THAT IT AGAIN LIKE THAT -- AUTHOR STATED THAT THIS DOES NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE BONA FIDE FACTORS SO WHILE IT'S TAKING ITS LOOKING AT AGGREGATE DATA FROM PLAYERS THERE'S NO EMPLOYER THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE A WAGE DISPARITY ON THESE REPORTS. BUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S UNLAWFUL WAGE DISPARITY IS THE CONCERN AND THEN ALL THE SUDDEN THIS COMPANY IS NOW SEEN AS SOMEONE WHO HAS UNLAWFUL WAGE DISPARITY WHEN NOT MIGHT NOT BE THE CASE THAT THE SITUATION BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS BUILDING. GIVE A STAFFERS WORK FREE FOR TWO WEEKS VERSUS STAFFER WHO'S WORKED THREE FOR THIRTY YEARS THOSE EFFORTS ARE GONNA BE MOST LIKELY AND AT THE SAME JOB TITLE BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE YOU HAVE. ESSENTIALLY A SOME IN SOME ABILITY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHILE THEY'RE BEING PAID SEPARATELY YOU'D HAVE TO COMPARE THAT INDIVIDUAL TO EVERY OTHER STAFFER AND THEN YOU HAVE TO COMPARE IT THEM TO EACH OTHER. SO IT'S JUST NOT A FEASIBLE WAY FOR THE EMPLOYER TO DO THAT UNDER THIS ITEM BILL AND SO THAT'S OUR BIGGEST CONCERN WOULD BE THAT THE PUBLIC SHAMING ASPECT IN THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT REALLY LOOKING AT UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR [inaudible] THANK YOU. MISTER AND MISTER CHRIS MCKAY LIAM BE HALF A CUP TEA IN THEI AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION RIGHT TO TWO ISSUES IN PARTICULAR BE QUICK -- FIRST OF ALL WE ARE VERY THANKFUL -- FOR A CENTER JACKSON TO TAKE SUBDIVISION A J. ARE REMAINING CONCERN IS IN SUBDIVISION I AND I'M SORRY DIDN'T PRINT OUT THE PAGE AND LINE ITEM BUT IN SUBDIVISION THE LANGUAGE THAT MISS CURTIS REFERENCED AND IN PARTICULAR THE CLAUSE THE PRIOR TO INSTITUTION. OF ANY PROCEEDING. AND SO WE FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOME PARTIAL PROTECTION OF THE INFORMATION NOT BE MADE PUBLIC. BUT NOT FULLY SO WE FROM CAN I DO SOMETHING I IN SUBDIVISION I THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE RAISED WITH -- CENTER WITH THE AUTHOR IS -- I REQUEST. TO ESSENTIALLY PRECLUDE ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY. UNDER THESE PROVISIONS -- THAT WOULD BE FOUND FOR VIOLATION OF THIS SECTION SO WE HAD PROPOSED SOME LANGUAGE OF ESSENTIALLY SAYING COMPLIANCE WITH THIS SECTION -- SHALL NOT RESULT IN ANY CIVIL LIABILITY OR GOVERNMENTAL ACTION PURSUANT TO THE EPA OR BUFFY HA -- AT THIS POINT YOU KNOW THE AUTHOR IS REJECTED THAT -- SUGGESTED -- MEANT A REQUESTED AMENDMENT AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE CAN SIT CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE LITIGATION CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE POSED SINCE THE FIRST COMMITTEE HEARING IN THE SENATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HIGH -- MICROBES IN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA IT'S IN THE AMERICAN STAFFING ASSOCIATION AND SO WE WE REPRESENT THE TEMPER STAFFING INDUSTRY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I'M PUSHING THE AUTHORS A COMMITMENT ON THE ON ON SOME LANGUAGE TO DEAL WITH THAT THE STAFFING ISSUE INTEREST JUST JUST. FOR BACKGROUND PURPOSES SO YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THAT ON THAT -- EEL ONE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS I'M GOING BACK. I KNOW I'VE BEEN TOLD DOZENS MAYBE YOU KNOW FORTY YEARS OR HOWEVER LONG I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S BEEN EXISTENCE BUT THERE'S A THERE'S A WHOLE LIST OF POSSIBLE EMPLOYERS ARE TYPES EMPLOYERS ARE EXCLUDED FROM REPORTING. CURRENTLY THAT THE CURRENT TRACK TYPE THE DATA. AND AND RELEASE ALL THE MEN THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS JUST TO SAY IF YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT UNDER THE FEDERAL E. L.. ONE REPORTING REQUIREMENT JUST. MAINTAIN THAT FOR CALIFORNIA FOR THAT FOR THE NEW REQUIREMENT ON THE PAID DATA AND SO IT'S OTHERWISE YOU'D BE CAPTURING PEOPLE REALLY TWICE PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T BEEN REPORTING. ANYTHING. BECAUSE ARE ARE EXCLUDED AND THEN ADDING THE PAYDAY THAT THING ON TOP OF A AND AND THERE'S RATIONALE FOR THAT AND AND WE'VE EXPLAINED AT THE OFFICE STAFF AND EXPLAIN IT HERE BUT I THINK YOU'RE IN A HURRY SO THE KEYBOARD. THANK YOU WE WILL HEAR ALL ARGUMENTS DESPITE TIME -- ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION. I BEHALF OF THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. KATIE HANSON OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION FOR THE REASONS STATED WERE OPPOSED MAKE YOU. THE CALL RICE CALVARY MANUFACTURES IN TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO POST MAKE YOU. AND BRIAN LITTLE OF CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FOR THE REASONS OUTLINED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CHAMBER ALSO OPPOSED THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING THAT ON IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE -- TRYING TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER [inaudible] AND IT KIND OF AMAZED BY THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENTS BECAUSE HAVING HAD A SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR IT'S YOU'RE TAKING A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND YET. WERE STILL OPPOSED -- I VERY MUCH THINK THE COMPANY SHOULD BE SHAMED AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH -- IT'S CLEAR. IT'S CLEAR THAT WHEN WE ALLOW THE MARKET TO WORK PUBLICLY AND OPENLY FORT. THE COMPANIES HAVE TO REPORT IF THEY HAD REPORT PUBLICLY THAT THEY'D BE MORE LIKELY TO EXAMINE THEIR OWN DATA AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. BUT I'M OKAY WITH THIS HALF STEP. IN THAT'S REALLY WHAT I CONSIDER IT SO -- I I HOPE WE CAN WORK ON THIS IN THE FUTURE TO BRING IT TO A FULL SHAME MEAN -- THAT COMPANIES DESERVE HILL DO NOT -- FOLLOW PAY EQUITY RULES AND WHO ARE NOT PROACTIVELY MOVING FORWARD TO CHANGE A SITUATION WITH THEIR OWN THEIR OWN WORKFORCE. EXAMPLE OF OF COURSE TO PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR VERY DIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME COULD BE NOTED IN ANY PAPERWORK OR ANYTHING THAT THEY MOVE FORWARD AND YOU. WOULD NEVER FACED A LAWSUIT BASED ON SOMEBODY WHO HAS THE SAME JOB TITLE BUT WAS THERE FOR TWO YEARS VERSES EIGHTEEN YEARS -- WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT WE ALL DO SO I I APPRECIATE LIKE I SAID WHAT I THINK IS A HALF STAFF -- AYE I AM PROUD TO MOVE THIS BILL I THINK I'M A CO AUTHOR ON IT BUT I THINK YOU FOR WORK FOR KEEPING DOING WORK ON THIS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU CENTER FOR BRING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK IT. AB THIS IMPORTANT A STEP BY. JOIN WITH MY COLLEAGUES ARE NO THE THING PRINCIPLE KALRA JOIN HONOR. BILL LAST YEAR -- WHICH I THINK WAS A FOR THAT YOU THINK. WE A STEP. IN A VERY POSITIVE EXCEPT THINK IT IS IMPORTANT -- FOR COMPANIES TO BE ABLE. TO LOOK AT THE MIRROR AND SEE WHERE THEY ARE AND TO DO IT INTENTIONALLY. AND I KNOW THAT THAT LAST YEAR THE CRITICISM WAS THAT COULD BE PUT TO SHAME BECAUSE A PUBLIC SCHOOL CLOSURE NOW ITS. POTENTIAL EXPOSURE COULD CAUSE SHAMING AND IN THE END OF THE DAY -- I KNOW THAT YOUR INTENTION JUST SAYS THE INTENTION [inaudible] WELL. YOU'RE IN TOUCH IS NOT SPECIFICALLY TO SHAME ANYONE I I KNOW THAT'S BECAUSE YES I CAN GO BACK -- TO BUT BUT THE REALITY IS THIS LOOK THAT THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR DECADES. I'M AND IT CAN BE PAINFUL TIES REST LOOK AT OURSELVES WHETHER ACCOMPANIES OTHER INDIVIDUALS SOCIETY A LEGISLATURE -- IT'S NOT EASY THING TO DO. THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT BUT THE REALITY IS THAT -- THE MARKET HAS ADJUSTED ON ITS OWN THE STATUS QUO HASN'T WORKED -- MAN AND YOU KNOW I THINK WE'LL TIMES UP AS IT APPLIES TO CERTAINLY MAKING SURE. THAT WE ARE DOING MORE THAN WE HAVE DONE IT STARTS WITH DATA SOURCE OF INFORMATION THE STARS THE COMPANIES BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT INFORMATION. AS SOME COMPANIES HAVE STARTED TO DO -- AND SAY OKAY WHAT ARE WE DOING LOOK WE BE DOING BETTER. AYE BECAUSE EVEN FOR ALL THESE FACTORS THAT ARE LISTED THAT MAY NOT. BE ME NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE REALITY IS WE KNOW THAT EVEN IF YOU COUNT FOR EVERYTHING THEY'RE STILL MAJOR DISPARITY. OF WITH WOMEN AND MEN IN TERMS OF PAY. AND WE KNOW THAT'S THE CASE THEN WE WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE WE DIDN'T TRY DO SOMETHING SERIOUS ABOUT IT -- I THINK THAT EMPLOYERS ARE SERIOUS ABOUT SOLVING THIS PROBLEM WILL LIKE TO SEE THAT DATA -- THEY'VE HOPEFULLY HAVE ALREADY DONE IT ON THEIR OWN. ANALYSIS BUT THE CASE IT MAY BE THAT MANY HAVE AN AND SO THIS FORCES THE ISSUE -- AND REQUIRES UNDERTAKE ó A GOOD HARD LOOK AT THEIR OWN PRACTICES AND WHAT THEY CAN DO BETTER AND THAT IT'S IT'S NOT A MATTER OF OF A RELEASE ON A MATTER OF SAYING WELL THIS IS A GOOD COMPANY VERSUS BACK UNDER THE REALITIES ARE SOCIETIES AT THIS PROBLEM. IT'S A SYSTEMIC ISSUE THE WAY YOU GET RID OF SYSTEMIC ISSUES IS TAKING A SYSTEMIC LOOK A DEEP DIVE INTO THE NUMBERS A DEEP DIVE INTO THE DATA. FROM THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY HAVE SOLUTIONS THAT THEN YOU CAN MEASURE OVER TIME TO SEE IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY MAKING PROGRESS ON THAT SYSTEMIC ISSUE. BUT WE'RE NOT EVEN WILLING TO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS WERE NOT WILLING TO LOOK AT OURSELVES THEN BRING KNOWLEDGE OF THE SYSTEM IS JUST FINE AND I CAN NOT A KNOWLEDGE THAT. THANK YOU. HE SAID MEMBER KALRA MISTER VICE CHAIR. HELLO SENATOR I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS AND AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE ONE COMMENT IN HINDA. IS FAST IN THAT WE'RE GOING AFTER FOR BUSINESSES PRIVATE BUSINESSES. WHEN WE HAVE? THE WAGE ISSUE WITHIN THE STONE BUILDING [inaudible] BETWEEN PARTIES. MATTER WOULD DEPEND ON WHAT PARTY THAT YOU FILL IT WITH. DICTATE YOUR PAY. AND SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE US IF THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE INFLICT ON PRIVATE BUSINESSES AND MAKE AYE AND I CAN'T SUPPORT IS. TO I THINK WE TAKE ONCE AGAIN AN INTERNAL LOOK AT THIS BUILDING. BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SAME ISSUES RIGHT HERE. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR QUESTIONS COMMENTS -- THE BILL HAS A MOTION IS OUR SECOND. THOSE BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED -- I'M SENATOR WOULD LIKE CLOSE THANK YOU YES UP I DON'T CONSIDER THIS AN INFLICTION -- WHETHER WE HAVE PROBLEMS IN THIS BILL I DON'T THINK ANY OF US DISAGREE WITH THAT HOW WE'RE TRYING TO FIX SOME OF THEM -- WE SHOULD BE FIXING. OF ALL OF THEM A GOVERNMENT JOBS THOUGH OR PUBLIC -- AND THE INFORMATION -- IS AVAILABLE THE IT NOT THE CASE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND SO -- I I I THINK THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION TO TO BE DRAWN. A IT IS FAR SAID IS CONCERNED -- AND I WANT -- TO AT RESPOND IF I MAY TO IT ASSEMBLY MEMBER A GONZALEZ FLETCHER -- WHEN I HEAR YOU TALKING I THINK TO MYSELF NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED? BECAUSE LAST YEAR WHERE WE HEARD YOUR BILL AND I SUPPORTED IT -- IT WAS PRETTY OUT THERE AND AND FOR ALL THE REASONS YOU'VE MENTIONED TODAY I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE. BUT I UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT THAT THERE MIGHT BE A WAY TO GET. TO THE SAME RESULT WITHOUT DOING QUITE IS DRAMATICALLY AND THAT'S THE BILL I BROUGHT THIS YEAR AND IT'S STILL A JOB KILLER BILL WHY WELL BECAUSE HE'S COMPANIES DON'T WANT. TO MAKE THIS INFORMATION AVAILABLE. IT'S LIKE WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS THEY DON'T WANNA CHECK THEY DON'T THEY DON'T WANT THIS DISCRIMINATION BUT THEY'RE NOT PREPARED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. AND WE KNOW THAT WHEN YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT NOTHING CHANGES. SO THIS IS A BILL. THAT THAT LOOKS AT HER FROM THE NOT THE GRANULAR LEVEL THE NOTION OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT I KEEP HEARING FROM THE CHAMBER KEY PRE READING MY BILL AND SAY HOW. CAN YOU POSSIBLY INTERPRETED TO SAY WE'RE GONNA OUT YOU. HOW CAN YOU INTERPRET IT TO SAY THAT THIS ISN'T -- THAT THAT THIS IS UNFAIR BECAUSE IT'S A AGAIN WHEN WE HAVE A PAY DISPARITIES IT'S GOING TO LUMP EVERYBODY TOGETHER IT DOES NOT. IT PUTS THEM INTO CATEGORIES. NOT INDIVIDUALS BUT CATEGORIES AND IF THERE IS AS WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION WHICH WE ALL KNOW EXISTS IF FORCES COMPANIES TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR. AND TO SEE THAT OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION AND TO BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT IT. THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. THEIR ROLE IS TO OUR HELP IDENTIFY AND TO CORRECT AND TWO WOULD GIVE INCENTIVES TO CORRECT. THE THE CHAMBERS ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT LITIGATION NO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET SUED IF YOU'RE NOT. DOING SOMETHING WRONG AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ROLE HERE IS TO HELP THESE COMPANIES WHEN THEY'VE LOOKED IN THE MIRROR AND THEY SEE THAT THEY ARE. A THEY HAVE OCCUPATIONAL. SEGREGATION TO CORRECT IT TO ASSIST THEM IN CORRECTING IT AND IF THEY DON'T THAT'S WHEN THE HAMMER COMES DOWN. I I CAN'T THINK OF IMPRINT JOURNAL WAY TO DO THIS. WE HAVE TO STOP ASKING PRETTY PLEASE BECAUSE PRETTY PLEASE HASN'T GOTTEN US A DARN THING FOR GENERATIONS AND THAT'S LEFT WOMEN AND FAMILIES WHO ARE LEAVING SO MUCH MONEY ON THE TABLE. AND ARE BEING DENIGRATED FOR THEIR HARD WORK AND NOT ABLE TO FEED THEIR FAMILIES THIS IS AN ECONOMIC ISSUE AND A FAIRNESS ISSUE. AND BUSINESSES HAVE GOT TO STEP FAR AS I CAN SEE AND I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING. OUT WITH THE CHAMBER AND ANYONE ELSE AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE SO THAT THERE'S NO. THERE'S NO LEGITIMATE CONCERN THAT WE'RE JUST LOOKING FOR WAYS TO EMBARRASSED COMPANIES -- WHICH IS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO LITIGATE WE'RE GIVING GIVING PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK ON AND IF WHEN THEY LOOK THEY DON'T CORRECT THAT'S WHEN THE HAMMER FALLS AND THAT'S AS IT SHOULD BE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THAT'S THE WAY. OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE OPERATES EARLY SHOULD OPERATE WERE GIVING EVERYBODY A CHANCE. TO COMPLY TO MOVE THE BALL FORWARD TO PAY PEOPLE FAIRLY TO PAY THEM EQUITABLY THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES UP PROVIDES THAT DATA SO THAT WE CAN LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND CORRECT THOSE MISTAKES. THERE'S NO SHAMING THERE IS NO FAULT THERE IS JUST LET'S FIX THE PROBLEM ONCE AND FOR ALL AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU SENATOR THIS BILL HAS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THURMAN AYE THURMAN AYE FLORA. FLORA NO GONZALEZ FLETCHER GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER AYE KALRA. KALRA I BEAT US. STEINORTH STEINORTH NO. BUT THAT BILLS OUT CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK YOU THINK CLUTCHING ONTO S. B.. THIRTEEN HUNDRED YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. UP MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. IN CONTINUING TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE PROTESTATIONS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM. BOTH WITHIN THIS BUILDING AND IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN. THE HALLS OF POWER THROUGHOUT. AMERICA. THAT WE START -- ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND PREVENTED. AND MAKE PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE AND COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE AND GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE WHEN WE DO NOT DO SO. OVER THE PAST YEAR AS WE ALL ARE FAIRLY WELL AWARE AS PART OF THE ME TO MOVEMENT WE'VE HEARD HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF BRAVE WOMEN IN MANY MEN AS WELL. COME FORWARD. TO SUPPOSE THE PREVALENCE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN WORKPLACES IN INDUSTRIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE'VE SEEN PERPETRATORS FINALLY BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE AFTER DECADES OF ABUSE AND HARASSMENT. WE'VE SEEN HOW DEVASTATING SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS TO VICTIMS TO THEIR CAREERS AND TO THEIR EMOTIONAL WELL BEING AND WE'VE ALSO LEARNED HOW CHALLENGING IT IS TO PREVENT. AND STOP THIS BEHAVIOR BECAUSE SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS ABOUT NO BETTER. IT'S ABOUT ENSURING THAT OUR LAWS OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AND OUR WORKPLACE CULTURES ARE WORKING TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN TRULY HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN THE WORKPLACE. WE DO TRUST AS WELL THAT OUR WORK AS MEN DO WE ARE TRUST A SMART WE ARE JUST AS CAPABLE WE IS OUR TRUST US HARD WORKING AND WE ARE JUSTICE THOSE SERVING. OF THE KIND OF RESPECT AND DIGNITY A THAT THOUGH WE ARE ENTITLED TO THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO IN THE WORKPLACE AND ELSEWHERE SO THIS IS INDEED A WORKPLACE CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE. NOW BACK IN THE EARLY SPRING I HELP TO HEARINGS AS THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND CHAIR OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON WOMEN WORKING FAMILIES. ABOUT WHAT WE COULD TO DO ADDRESS SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN REAL AN ENDURING WAYS IT BECAME SINGLE MAGIC BULLET TO THIS PROBLEM. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE AND MADE NOW. SO THIS BILL RESPONSE TO THAT CHALLENGE WITH A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF CHANGES TO THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. IN BROAD STROKES THOSE REFORMS MAY BE CHARACTERIZED AS CLOSING LOOPHOLES IN EXISTING HARASSMENT LAW STRENGTHENING SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. AND CRACKING DOWN ON THE USE OF CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS WHICH PREVENT VICTIMS FROM SPEAKING OUT AND SHIELD SENIOR OF SHIELDING SERIAL HARASSERS AGAINST ACCOUNTABILITY. SO THE KEY HIGHLIGHTS TO THE BILL ARE. ONE THIS MEASURE PROVIDES GUIDANCE TO THE COURTS ON THE SEVERE AND PERVASIVE LEGAL STANDARD AND I WILL SAY I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IS A HIGH STANDARD. BUT IT WAS CLEAR FROM BOTH THE PLAINTIFF AND DEFENSE SIDE THAT WITH SOME TWEAKING THIS STANDARD DOES WORK AND IS WORKABLE AND SO WHAT WE CASUALLY MIGHT LABEL SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN EVERYDAY LIFE IS ACTUALLY FAR DIFFERENT THAN THE NARROW IMPRECISE LEGAL DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT? BUT ACCORDING TO THAT LEGAL STANDARD THE CONDUCT MUST BE UNWELCOME IT MUST BE DISCRIMINATORY AND IT MUST MEET THE LEVEL OF BECOMING SEVERE OR PERVASIVE WHICH IS A HIGH BAR. AND FRANKLY HAS TOO OFTEN BECOE A WAY OF EXCUSING OUTRAGEOUS BEHAVIOR INSTEAD OF A WAY TO LIFT UP VICTIMS AND HOLD PERPETRATORS ACCOUNTABLE. SO WE SIT WE PRESERVE THAT STANDARD FOR WHAT CONSTITUTES HARASSMENT BUT WE PROVIDE KEY GUIDANCE TO THE COURTS. ENCOURAGING THEM TO APPLY THE LAW IN A WAY THAT FOCUSES ON WORKPLACE FAIRNESS FIRST AND FOREMOST. TO THIS IN THE BILL INCENTIVIZE IS EMPLOYERS TO INTERVENE EARLY. TO PREVENT INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR FROM ESCALATING TO THAT SEVERE AND PERVASIVE STANDARD WHICH WOULD THEN SUBJECT THEM TO LITIGATION UNDER CURRENT LAW WHEN PEOPLE MOSTLY THOUGH NOT EXCLUSIVELY WOMEN ARE DEALING WITH INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR AT WORK. TOO OFTEN THEIR ONLY REAL CHOICE IS TO SUCK IT UP [inaudible] ORDER QUIT. AND WE KNOW IN TODAY'S WORLD HOW DIFFICULT THAT IS WITH THE THE THE FACT THAT OF WOMEN ARE IN THE WORKPLACE TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES TO KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS TO FEED THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES TO KEEP THEM CLOSE TO BE ABLE. TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE BASIC NECESSITIES OF LIFE AND THIS REALLY DOESN'T THAT IT ISN'T A A REAL CHOICE. IN MANY INSTANCES. SO THIS BILL. OF WILL -- TELL EMPLOYERS A OR SAY THAT IN EMPLOYERS LEGAL DUTY TO TAKE ACTION BEGINS THE MOMENT THEY KNOW. OF UNWELCOME INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR NOT JUST WHEN THAT BEHAVIOR METASTASIZE IS INTO THE KIND OF SEVERE PERVASIVE MISCONDUCT THE COURTS CALL HARASSMENT. THREE THIS BILL STRENGTHENED SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRAINING REQUIREMENTS I'VE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND FRANKLY FROM THIS BUILDING IS WELL KNOW THAT ARE SET SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING PROGRAMS. ARE NOT ADEQUATE. ARE NOT ADEQUATE. AND THAT IS TO SAY THE LEAST. THIS MEASURE WILL REQUIRE TRAINING FOR ALL WORKERS NOT CHIU SUPERVISORS BECAUSE ALL WORKERS CAN BE THE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. ANNEKE ALL ALSO CALLS FOR THE INCLUSION OF INNOVATIVE BYSTANDER INTERVENTION TRAINING TECHNIQUES TO DE ESCALATE AND DISTRACT WHICH NOT ONLY DISRUPT THAT INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR BUT ALSO CREATE A SHARED SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY. FOR MAINTAINING AN INCLUSIVE AND HEALTHY WORKPLACE CULTURE AND FINALLY THE BILL CLOSES LOOPHOLES. IN THE LAW THAT HAVE FACILITATED HARASSMENT. THE ME TOO MOVEMENT HAS REVEALED HOW CERTAIN LEGAL TACTICS THINGS LIKE MANDATORY CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION. SECRET SETTLEMENTS HAVE PUT THE LAW TO WORK TO SILENCE VICTIMS AND SHIELD HARASSERS FROM ACCOUNTABILITY JUST THINK OF HARVEY WEINSTEIN. JUST THINK OF THE WAY THAT MAN WAS ABLE TO GO ON FOR DECADES THROUGH THE KINDS OF A AGREEMENTS THAT HE WAS ABLE TO EXTRACT FROM PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR HIM. AND THAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF HOW THE LAW SHOULD WORK SO THIS MEASURE A MEASURE WILL RESTRICT THE PRACTICE OF IMPOSING SILENCE ON WORKERS. THROUGH EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS SHOULD HAVE NON DISPARAGEMENT AGREEMENT AND STOP EMPLOYERS FROM UTILIZING SNEAKY RELEASES A PRACTICE IN WHICH WORKERS SIGN SOME PAPER TO GET POTENTIALLY A LITTLE REYES FROM A SMALL BONUS FOR A BIG BONUS. WITHOUT REALIZING THAT IN FACT THEY SIGNED THEIR A ROOF RIGHT AWAY TO SEEK JUSTICE. THESE ARE THE ITEMS I THINK THERE'S A FAIRLY COMPREHENSIVE BILL -- IS A RECOVERING LAWYER I BELIEVE THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO BE CLEAR ON WHAT THE STANDARDS ARE HELP THE COURTS SO THAT WE CAN DIRECT THEIR BEHAVIOR INCENTIVIZE EMPLOYERS. CORRECT THE PROBLEM BEFORE IT RISES TO THE LEVEL WHEN LAWSUITS ARE GOING TO BE OF FORTHCOMING. AND TO MAKE SURE WE PROTECT VICTIMS A WITHOUT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND HAVE WITH ME TODAY PAMELA LOPEZ A PARTNER A CASE ST CONSULTING ELIZABETH RILES. THE MANAGING PARTNER AT BALL BOUGHT IN ROYALS. YOU SENATOR PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS ELIZABETH RYALS AND I AM. STILL I'M NOT A RECOVERING LAWYER I AM AN ACTIVE ATTORNEY. IN OAKLAND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION -- TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THIS BILL. I THINK WHAT SENATOR JACKSON'S THAT IS CORRECT WHAT'S ALL TOO CLEAR. FROM THE RECENT ME TO MOVEMENT IS THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS STILL VERY MUCH A PERVASIVE PROBLEM INGRAINED IN THE CULTURE OF OUR WORKPLACES. I GET CALLS ALL THE TIME FROM WORKERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED SEXUAL HARASSMENT ON THE JOB. THEY DESCRIBE HAVING TO DEAL WITH CO WORKERS AND SUPERVISORS WHO INSST ON DISCUSSING SEX. SEXUAL POSITIONS AND THEIR SEX PARTNERS. IN ONE RECENT INSTANCE A WOMAN DESCRIBED TO ME HOW HER CO WORKERS AND SUPERVISOR WARRANT COURAGE IN HER TO GO OUT WITH ANOTHER MAN AT THE OFFICE. SHE REPEATEDLY REFUSED AND ULTIMATELY WITH OTHER CO WORKER FOLLOWED HER INTO A BATHROOM AND ASSAULTED HER. SHE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS AND WAS TERMINATED FROM HER POSITION. THESE ARE NOT THE KIND OF WORK EXPERIENCES THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE ANYONE SHOULD HAVE TO INDOOR. YET UNFORTUNATELY THESE INCIDENTS ARE HAPPENING EVERY DAY UP AND DOWN THE STATE IN EVERY KIND OF WORK ENVIRONMENT. WOMEN FEEL LIKE THEY MUST OVERCOME THE SEXUALLY HARASSING CONDUCT AND SOLDIER ON THEY OFTEN CANNOT AFFORD TO QUIT OR TAKE TIME OFF. AND THEY CONTINUED TO WORK DESPITE EXPERIENCING DEPRESSION. TRAUMA AND ANXIETY. THEY SHOULD NEVER BE PENALIZED IN THEIR SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CONTINUE TO WORK HARD. TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES AND WERE PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYEES DESPITE THE CONDUCT THAT THEY WERE FORCED TO INDOOR. S. B. THIRTEEN HUNDRED WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THESE FAILURES AND INCONSISTENCIES BY THE COURT BY PROVIDING STATUTORY GUIDANCE ON WHAT SEVERE OR PERVASIVE MEANS. FOR PURPOSES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS THE BILL WILL CLARIFY THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT MEANS THE CONDUCT OBJECTIVELY AND SUBJECTIVELY INTERFERED WITH THE WORKERS ABILITY TO DO OUR JOB. A WOMAN SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SURVIVE HER WORKPLACE SHOULD BE GIVEN AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO THRIVE IN IT. THIS BILL WILL ALSO STRENGTHENED IN EMPLOYERS DUTY TO PREVENT HARASSMENT BY MAKING CLEAR THAT THE DUTY START AS SOON AS THE EMPLOYER IS AWARE THAT THERE IS UNWELCOME CONDUCT [inaudible] FOR EXAMPLE. I HEARD FROM A POTENTIAL CLIENT RECENTLY COMPLAINED ABOUT A CO WORKERS USE OF A WHITE BOARD. DEPICT SEXUAL MATERIAL POSITIONS EXETER. THE EMPLOYER INTERVIEW THE COMPLAINANT. BUT THE EMPLOYER DETERMINE THAT THIS INCIDENT DID NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF SEVERE OR PERVASIVE AND THEREFORE TOOK NO FURTHER ACTION. THIS KIND OF DECISION ENCOURAGES THE PERPETRATOR TO CONTINUE THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR AND EVENTUALLY TO ESCALATED. IT ALSO DISCOURAGES EMPLOYEES FROM COMPLAINING ABOUT. BEHAVIOR AND CONDUCT THAT THEY EXPERIENCE S. B. THIRTEEN HUNDRED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE EMPLOYER HAS A DUTY TO STOP THIS BEHAVIOR FROM THE BEGINNING. RATHER THAN ALLOW INAPPROPRIATE OR OFFENSIVE CON TO CONTINUE TO THE SECOND THIRD OR FOURTH VICTIM BEFORE FINALLY ESCALATES TO SEVERE PERVASIVE. ANOTHER CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THIS BILL IS BANNING THE LEGAL TACTIC THAT EMPLOYERS INTERIOR HARASSERS HAVE USED TO TRYING TO GET AROUND ANTI HARASSMENT AND ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS. I'VE SEEN AND MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SEEN MANY EMPLOYERS THAT REQUIRE WORKERS TO SIGN VARIOUS LEGAL DOCUMENTS AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT AS A WAY TO SILENCE VICTIMS ESCAPE LIABILITY. OR MINIMIZE PUBLIC SCRUTINY. IN CONCLUSION THIS BILL TAKES A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING SEX HARASSMENT AND PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR STRENGTHENING OUR EXISTING LAWS AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. AND ENSURING THAT THESE RIGHTS CANNOT BE CONTRA CONTRACTED AWAY BY DECEPTIVE LEGAL AGREEMENTS AND FOR THAT I STRONGLY URGE YOUR AYE [inaudible] I VOTE. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS GOOD AFTERNOON -- AYE PAMELA LOPEZ AND I'M THE PRESIDENT OF WORK EQUITY AND I AM A SURVIVOR OF SEX WILL HARASSMENT. OUR ORGANIZATION SEEKS TO EMPOWER SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST SEXUAL HARASSMENT SO THAT WE HAVE A FIGHT -- I OR I HAVE A VOICE IN THIS EFFORT AND AS A PART OF THIS WORK I'VE TRAVELED THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND MET WITH MANY GROUPS OF WOMEN. AND MEN WHO HAVE SURVIVED SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR EVEN SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THEIR WORKPLACES AND THEY'VE A LOT TO SAY ABOUT WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE TO CHANGE OUR WORKPLACE CULTURE SO THAT THEY FEEL SAFE AND CAN CONTRIBUTE THEIR VERY FAST. AT WORK AND DOES THEIR PERSPECTIVE IS WHY WORK EQUITY SUPPORTS S. B. -- THIRTEEN HUNDRED FIRST AND FOREMOST EMPLOYERS NEED TO BE INCENTIVIZED TO IMPROVE WORK PLACE CULTURE TO MAKE SURE THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT DOES NOT OCCUR IN THE FIRST PLACE. SP THIRTEEN HUNDRED SUPPORTS THIS GOAL THROUGH -- STRENGTH AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION TO I'M MOST IMPORTANT -- FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SURVIVORS IS THE BYSTANDER INTERVENTION TRAINING BYSTANDER INTERVENTION TRAINING GOES A LONG WAY TOWARD EMPOWERING THOSE CO WORKERS WHO WISH TO SPEAK UP WITHOUT BRICK CREATING A REQUIREMENT THAT THEY DO. SO THAT THEY CAN HELP THEIR FELLOW COLLEAGUES FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY HAS THEIR BACK WHEN WE SEE SEXUAL HARASSMENT START TO CREEP UP -- IN THE WORKPLACE. SHOULD HARASSMENT OR UNWANTED BEHAVIOR OCCUR IT NEEDS TO STOP BEFORE IT RISES TO THE LEVEL OF SEVERE OR PERVASIVE. UP IN THE WORDS OF MANY SURVIVORS WITH WHOM I MET I'VE MET CAN YOU IMAGINE TRYING TO GET TO A PRESENTATION OR SIT THROUGH A MEETING WITH A CO WORKER. WHO GROPED YOU BUT ONLY DID IT ONCE HUNT AND SO S. B. -- THIRTEEN HUNDRED HELPS TO INCENTIVIZE IMMEDIATE ACTION ON THE PART OF EMPLOYERS WHEN UNWANTED BEHAVIOR BEGINS TO OCCUR. FINALLY S. B. THIRTEEN HUNDRED HOPES TO PROTECT THE RIGHT OF SURVIVORS TO TELL OUR STORIES AND THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART NOT ONLY OF OUR OWN HEALING. BUT OF OUR ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE MEANINGFULLY TO THE EFFORT TO CHANGE OUR WORKPLACE CULTURES SO THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT STOPS OCCURRING IN THE FIRST PLACE FOR THESE REASONS WORK EQUITY SUPPORTS SB THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL. SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE WORK OF WORK EQUITY ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. BREAK A OUR CHARLOTTE THE CALIFORNIA PLUMMET LAWYERS ASSOCIATION PROUD TO BE A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL ARCHER SUPPORT THANK YOU. JESSICA CENTER ON BEHALF OF EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES ALSO PROUD TO SPOT CO SPONSOR THIS BILL IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU.

MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. MEMBER FILE LEGAL IT WORK AUSTIN SUPPORTS. JOSHUA LOCAL WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. WHEN MRS HERE YOU CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU? I DISCOVERED THAT WHEN THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND TODAY'S OFFERING SUPPORT FROM THE STRONGER CALIFORNIA COALITION. THANK YOU A LOT ELSE TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE AND IF THERE'S OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON MARK CURTIS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY AT WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO SB THIRTEEN HUNDRED WHICH IS. ANOTHER JOB KILLER FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN THAT IT'S M. WILL CREATE A CRUSHING AMOUNT OF LITIGATION FOR EMPLOYERS AND THAT'S OUR CONCERN AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S TIME DISCUSSING THIS BILL WITH US -- BUT OUR CONCERNS REMAIN IN THAT. CURRENTLY UNDER THE LAW AND AS THE US THAT HAS SENATOR MENTIONED THERE IS A SEVERE PERVASIVE STANDARD AND WE SEE THIS BILL AS A WAY AROUND THAT SEVERE PERVASIVE STANDARD BECAUSE YOU NO LONGER ACTUALLY PROVE THAT HAVE TO PROVE THE ANYONE SUFFERED FROM HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION. IN ORDER TO SUE YOU ONLY HAVE TO PROVE THAT IT WAS A ANYONE. SUMMER AND EMPLOYEE A BY STANDARD CAN BE ANYBODY AND THAT IT WAS UNWELCOME TO YOU AND THAT YOU AND NOTIFIED THE EMPLOYER SO YOU WENT AHEAD AND TOLD THEM THAT YOU FOUND AND WELCOME AND THAT THEY FAILED TO TAKE ALL REASONABLE STEPS. IN ORDER TO PREVENT THIS HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION IF IT WERE TO CONTINUE THEN IT WOULD BECOME HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION NOT THAT IT IS YET CURRENTLY UNDER THE LAW THE DF THE AGE HAS POLICE POWER AND REGARDING PREVENTION OF HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION AND EMPLOYERS HAVE AN AFFIRMATIVE DUTY TO PREVENT HARASSMENT. OR DISCRIMINATION ABED DE IF THE H. CAN ENFORCE ANY SORT OF NON MONETARY REMEDY AGAINST THOSE EMPLOYERS THAT ARE NOT ARE THAT ARE FAILING TO PREVENT HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION. AND SO OUR CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS THAT IT ALLOWS FOR SOMEONE TO SUE FOR HYPOTHETICAL NO ONE'S ACTUALLY SUFFERED HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION AND THAT YOU CAN BRING A LAWSUIT. IF I WERE TO CONTINUE TO RUN THROUGH THE RED LIGHT THEN I WOULD GET A TICKET IF I STOPPED AND I SHOULD NOT GET THE TICKET AND THE DMV AGE HAS UP PLEASE POWER TO ENFORCE THAT. AND THAT'S OUR BIGGEST CONCERN WITH THIS BILL ALONG WITH THE OTHER AND ISSUES THAT MISTER MCNEALY WILL MENTION REGARDING THE ADD NON DISPARAGEMENT AGREEMENTS AND SEPARATE AGREEMENTS. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED. OF VERY QUICKLY MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD JUST A A SUBDIVISION QUE FIRST THREE QUICK ITEMS -- THAT IS WHERE THE BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO POVIDE KEY GUIDANCE TO THE COURTS AND OUR CONCERN IS THAT IT SUBSTANTIALLY. BY LOWERS THE BAR IN QUE -- TO CAP A IT SAYS THAT THE EMPLOYER KNEW THAT THE CONDUCT WAS UNWELCOME TO THE PLAINTIFF. AT WHAT POINT DID THE EMPLOYER NO BECAUSE THE VICTIM INFORM THE EMPLOYER THAT THEY HAD PRIOR NOTICE. OF WHO IS THE PLAINTIFF IS THE PLAINTIFF ACTUALLY THE VICTIM. FOR A THIRD PARTY A BYSTANDER FOR EXAMPLE WHO FOUND THE CONDUCT WAS UNWELCOME TO HIM OR TO HER. IN SUBDIVISION BE -- QUE TO BE. IF IT INCREASED. SO THE WAY I READ THAT LANGUAGE IS IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T MEET THE STANDARD. BUT IT MIGHT IN THE FUTURE. AND I THINK MISS CURTIS'S -- ANALOGY TO RUNNING THE RED LIGHT. A SEEMS APPLICABLE HERE IN OTHER WORDS. IF I IT COULD BE THAT I RUN THE RED LIGHT AND IF I DO I VIOLATED THE LAW. BUT THIS ASSUMES THAT IT WILL ACHIEVE THAT STATUS AND YET DOESN'T REQUIRE IT. WHICH IS WHY IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL LOWERING OF THE BAR. IF IT IN SUBDIVISION BE IF IT INCREASED IN SEVERITY OR PRE OR BECAME PERVASIVE NOT THAT IT IS WHICH IS THE LEGAL STANDARD TODAY. AND THEN IN A AND B. E. CAPS A AND B. IT USES THE TERM OF ART THE PHRASE THAT CONDUCT. AND NOW IN IN SUBDIVISION SEE IT SAYS SAME OR SIMILAR CONDUCT AND WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT. AND LASTLY I WOULD NOTE IN TWO CAPS SEE. ALL REASONABLE STEPS WHAT ARE ALL OF THE REASONABLE STEPS. BUT YOU KNOW REASONABLE IS QUITE NEBULOUS ITSELF BUT THEN ALL. IF YOU DID ONE OR THREE OF THE REASONABLE ITEMS IS THAT SUFFICIENT TO STEM LIABILITY OR NOT. IN SECTION FOUR OF THE BILL WE DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT THAT LANGUAGE -- IS IS GOING TO LIMIT THE ABILITY TO SETTLE -- CASES HERE -- AND THEN IN SECTION FIVE OF THE BILL -- THE PREVAILING PAY PLAINTIFF THE PREVAILING PARTY GETS ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. AND THEN THIS BILL ADDS A MAJOR EXCEPTION. EXCEPT FOR THE PREVAILING DEFENDANT. IN WHICH CASE WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THRESHOLD FOR THE DEFENDANT -- TO RECOVER ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. AND WE SHOULD LEAVE EXISTING WALL AS IS TO THE PREVAILING PARTY. YOU CHAIR MEMBERS CALL RICE CALVARY MANY FACTORS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION I APPRECIATE YOU ALLOWING ME TO PROVIDE THIS TESTIMONY WE ARE ALSO OPPOSED TO THE BILL ON AN ASSOCIATE OURSELVES WITH THE COMMENTS AND CONCERNS RAISED BY THE TWO PREVIOUS SPEAKERS -- BUT WE ALSO HAVE OR OPPOSED TO AN ADDITIONAL REASON AND THIS BILL IT'S THE BYSTANDER INTERVENTION TRAINING -- SP THIRTEEN HUNDRED CREATES THE SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT REQUIREMENT TO TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES ON HOW TO YOU ON BYSTANDER INTERVENTION AND ASK THE BILL DESCRIBES IT IT'S IT'S TAKING ACTION ENCOURAGING THOSE EMPLOYEES TO TAKE ACTION AND INTERVENE. BASED ON THE PERSPECTIVE PERCEPTION PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR AND IT'S NOT EVEN CLEAR THAT IS JUST RELATED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT IT COULD BE ANY HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION SCENE. AND SEE MTA TAKES ISSUE WITH THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS TRAINING WE FEEL THAT IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS EMPLOYERS TO TRAIN OUR EMPLOYEES ON HOW TO RECOGNIZE AND HOW TO REPORT SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THAT IS INAPPROPRIATE BUT A TRAINING THEM TO INTERVENE WHEN WITNESSING SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR ANY HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE WE THINK IS NOT OUR ROLE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE KIND OF LIABILITY THAT WOULD IMPOSE UPON US AS EMPLOYERS. BECAUSE WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY AND HEALTH OF ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES -- AND WE ACTUALLY FEEL THAT THE CONVERSATION THAT'S HAPPENING AT THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE PROPHESIES THAT NEED TO BE CHANGED ACTUALLY SUPPORT THIS KIND OF THINKING. IN RECENT ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT THE BYSTANDER TRAINING -- AND ENGAGEMENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS PROPOSING THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE ENCOURAGING THOSE WHO ARE WITNESSING WHO HAVE WITNESSED SEXUAL HARASSMENT TO REPORT THROUGH THE PROPER CHANNELS WE AGREED THAT IS THE PROPER ROLE OF THE EMPLOYER. TO ENCOURAGE OUR EMPLOYEES TO REPORT BUT NOT TO ENGAGE IN POTENTIALLY GET THEMSELVES IN A SITUATION THEY CAN'T HANDLE AND ALSO CREATE HARM IN THE SITUATION. WE THINK THAT IS A MUCH MORE MEASURE APPROACH AND FOR THOSE REASONS AND THOSE PREVIOUSLY STATED A WE ARE OPPOSED ANNOUNCED FOR YOUR NUVO THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IT OPPOSITION. TRACY CELLPHONE THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN RESPECT OPPOSITION MAKE YOU.

IF IF WE HAVE SOME CLARIFYING -- LANGUAGE OR HELPING THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AS OPPOSED TO WHAT. I KIND OF READ INTO WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND I AND EVEN MENTION TO TO THE OPPOSITION. ARE EVEN IN MY OWN [inaudible] WORK. YEARS -- ORDER FOR SAVE LOS ANGELES I MENTION TO THEM THAT IF I HAD AN EMPLOYEE -- WHO SAT IN A CUBICLE AND ABOUT TEN WOMEN? TALKING ABOUT BRAD PITT IN SOME VERY ON SUGGESTED WAYS. AND AND WHAT THEY WOULD DO TO HIM. AND AFTERWARD HE CAME TO ME AND SAID HE LIKED IT. IT WAS A CHRISTIAN. AND THAT WAS THE PROBLEM. BEEN A MALE TALK TO ANOTHER MALE. AND I WAS SUPERVISE ALL THE SUPERVISORS. I SAID SOME BE TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE BUT TIME. I SAID NO. ANYONE IN WOMEN WENT. TO DO WHICH ARE SIGNED YOU UP GLAD TO ANY LOOKED AT ME AND SAID. AND MY SON'S A CHRISTIAN. AND I IMMEDIATELY. MY EYES GOT LIKE THIS BIG THEM REALLY AND I WENT TO OUR PERSONNEL. WHO EXPLAINED TO ME THAT ONE MY COMMENT WAS INAPPROPRIATE? TO THAT I NEEDED TO HAVE MORE TRAINING. AND I REALIZED I DID. NEED MORE TRAINING ABOUT THIRD PARTY OUT SITE. OBSERVING WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AS SEXUAL HARASSMENT IT WASN'T ABOUT WHAT I PERCEIVED. S. SEXUAL HARASSMENT BUT WHAT. A PERSON WHO'S EXPERIENCING IT. THAT'S WHAT EVERITT IS A SEXUAL HARASSMENT TO THEM. I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT JUDGMENT. IF WHAT THE FOR THE TRAINING. THE ONE FOR PERSONNEL ONE FOR SOMEBODY. TO TALK TO ME AS A AS A MANAGER AS A SUPERVISOR TO CORRECT ME. I PROBABLY STILL WOULD BE MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND SO I I I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. WITH THE TRAINING I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THIRD PARTY BECAUSE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT -- FOR MEN. NOW SAID THE MAN -- WELL WE HEAR ANOTHER MAN MAKE [inaudible] COMMENTS [inaudible] ABOUT -- COLLEAGUES BODY PARTS OR WHAT THEY WOULD DO WE NEED TO SHUT IT DOWN. BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY UNTIL WE ACTIVELY SHUT IT DOWN. TO AND WE GET INVOLVED SO I ALSO UNDERSTAND. WHAT YOU TRYING TO DO BECAUSE? A LOT OF THE PROBLEM IS WITH US. AND A LOT OF THE REMIS THIS WILL BE WITH US. AND AND SO I APPLAUD YOU ON WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND HOPEFULLY. EITHER IN YOUR CLOSING -- ORG SOMEWHERE ALONG THIS LINE YOU KIND OF CLARIFY WHICH ARE REAL ATTENTIVE AND IN DOING THIS. AND IT'S REALLY ABOUT NAM MAKING THIS A SAFE AND SECURE WORKPLACE FOR EVERYONE -- EN AND WEATHER XIN MANUFACTURE -- AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTY -- OR IN THE CAPITAL. ON IT IT'S ABOUT. DOING THE RIGHT THING AND THEN REALLY UNDERSTANDING THAT. THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS WHAT I DEFINE. IT'S WHAT IT IS. AND THAT WE WE'VE JUST WHICH GOT A BETTER AT IT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE PROBABLY LIVING IN A NINETEEN SIXTIES MADMAN KINDA. CUT UP UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT IS AND IT'S WRONG WHO AND UNTIL WE UNDERSTAND IT'S DISAVOWED IN. EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN EIGHTEEN OF IT WILL CONTINUE TO GO ON A LONG SOUGHT AGAIN I APPLAUD UNITE AND HONESTLY BELIEVE. IF ON BUSINESS WORKS WITH YOU. AND DOES THE RIGHT THING BECAUSE I NOTE SINCE I DID THE RIGHT THING. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. WOULD NOT BE SUIT WHO WHO. BECAUSE I WENT BACK. AND LATER TOLD HEAD A MEETING WITH ALL MY EMPLOYEES. AND SHUT DOWN THOSE CONVERSATIONS AMONG ANYONE IN THE OFFICE. THEY MADE THAT AND PERSON OUT A MEMO AND MADE THAT A DIRECTIVE THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE NO MATTER HOW INNOCENT OR YOU MAY THINK IT IS WE WOULD NO LONGER HAVE THOSE SIDEBAR CONVERSATIONS NEAR WATER COOLER. OF ANY KIND ANYWHERE AND I SATISFIED THAT PERSON WHICH KEPT US FROM HAVING A LAWSUIT. BUT AGAIN IT'S ALLOWING THAT PERSON TO TALK TO YOU. I TALK TO SOMEBODY RESPONSIBLE THAT KNOWS WHAT TO DO THAT'S BEEN TRAINED -- YOU CAN AVOID ALL SORTS OF LITIGATION. AND HAVE A BETTER WORKPLACE SO HOPEFULLY NAM. YOU CAN CLARIFY SOME OF THAT MAKE ME HAPPY TUNE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. THE OTHER MEMBERS WISHING TO ADD TO THE DISCUSSION. SEEING NONE LOOKING FOR MOTION. BILL'S BEEN MOVED OFF SECOND SENATOR WOULD LIKE CLOSE THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION AND I CONTINUE TO BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE CHAMBER. WHICH JUST NOT READING THE SAME PILL. ARE IS A LAWYER AND WORKING WITH LAWYERS THE INTERPRETATION THAT WORD HEARING IS JUST NOT. ACCURATE CAUGHT UP BUT I AM MORE THAN HAPPY WE HAVE TAKEN SOME AMENDMENTS TO REINFORCE THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE. TO HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED TO HAVE STANDING YOU CAN'T NOBODY IT'S NOT JUST ANYBODY CAN SUE -- THE YEAH IF YOU REPORT A A TWO HR THAT SOMEONE'S BEHAVING IN AN INAPPROPRIATE SEXUALIZED MANNER TOWARDS YOU IN THE WORKPLACE. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPECT THE HR TO TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO STOP THAT AND IN FACT THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES IT SAYS. IF YOU. A HAVE EXPERIENCE AND THE EXPERIENCE BEHAVIOR WHICH IS ON WELCOMED IT'S NOT THAT THE EMPLOYER SHOULDN'T ALL. WE'VE MADE WE TIED IT UP IT'S THAT THE EMPLOYEE HAS GONE TO THE EMPLOYER. SO EMPLOYERS DON'T HAVE TO GUESS. THIS BILL SAYS THE EMPLOYER KNOWS AND THE EMPLOYER'S GONNA NOLL BECAUSE THEY KNOW BECAUSE SOMEONE STOLE THEM. SO THAT'S ONE ISSUE -- THE A EMPLOYEES CAN'T SUE FOR A LITTLE THING THEY FIND INAPPROPRIATE ARE UNWELCOME IN THE WORKPLACE -- THAT I'D LIKE TO USE THE ANALOGY THAT THE CHAMBER USED IF YOU RUN A RED LIGHT. YOU'RE ENTITLED TO A CITATION YOU VIOLATED THE LAW BUT IF YOU STOP BEFORE YOU GET TO THE RED LIGHT. YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG. AND THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF WHAT THIS BILL IS THAT THAT IS TRYING TO DO AND I BELIEVE THE LANGUAGE AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO CLARIFY IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION ABOUT THAT. YOU DON'T GET YOUR NOT GONNA GET SUED UNTIL YOU RUN THROUGH THAT RED LIGHT. AND SO -- THAT THAT IS -- AYE I THINK. AGAIN I I THINK FRANKLY THIS IS JUST THAT THE FOLKS WHO OR POST THIS BILL DON'T WANT THE BILL. A BUT WE'VE TIGHTENED UP THE LANGUAGE THE NOTION OF BYSTANDER -- TRAINING IT DOESN'T SAY BYSTANDER INTERVENTION. IT SHOWS US TRAINING. SO THAT IF A BY STANDER WANTS TO INTERVENE. THERE'S NO ROOM THERE'S NO LIABILITY IF THEY DON'T THERE'S NO MANDATE THAT THEY INTERVENE IT'S TRUST THAT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE THE TOOLS SO THEY IF THEY FEEL COMPELLED OR IF THEY FEEL EMPOWERED. THINGS HAD A VERY SIMPLE LIKE HELPING MOVE THE VICTIM AWAY FROM A DANGEROUS SITUATION WE'RE DOING THIS NOW WITH COLLEGE STUDENTS AND IN FACT IT IS WORKING. SO LET'S DO THIS IN THE WORKPLACE GIVE PEOPLE THE TOOLS THAT'S ALL WE DO. A UNDER THIS AND THEN THE NOTION OF ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. ALL WE'RE DOING IS MIRRORING EXISTING CIVIL RIGHTS LAW. SO THERE'S NOTHING NEW HERE THAT'S THE LAW TODAY IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACTION -- I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE THAT I MISSED -- BUT I WILL ASSURE YOU THAT I WILL CONTINUE -- TO WORK -- AND HAD IS RECENTLY AS YESTERDAY AT A MEETING WITH THE CHAMBER FOLKS TO TALK ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS IF THERE'S A WAY WE CAN TWEAK THE LANGUAGE THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE A CRUSHING AMONG THE LITIGATION. ANYMORE SO THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY AS THAT DAM HAS FINALLY BROKEN AS THE MATT LAUER'S AS THE YEAH HARVEY WEINSTEIN'S AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON AND ON% WOMEN ARE FINALLY WILLING TO STEP FORWARD. AND TAKING DOWN -- SOME VERY WHO HAVE BEEN ALLOWED FOR DECADES TO BEHAVE IN A WAY THAT IS JUST CONTRARY TO WHAT IS APPROPRIATE IN TODAY'S WORLD. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO WE MAINTAIN A VERY HIGH STANDARD. I COULD REDUCE THAT STANDARD TO SOMETHING MUCH MUCH LOWER THEN YOU'D SEE A FLOODGATE OF LITIGATION. BUT THE GOAL HERE IS TO GET COMPLIANCE. TO AVOID LITIGATION IF WE CAN BUT NOT TO PUT VICTIMS OF THIS BEHAVIOR AT A DISADVANTAGE LET'S EDUCATE PEOPLE LET'S INFORM THEM LET'S PREVENT AND LET'S PUT A HAMMER IF WE CAN'T GET PEOPLE TO START BEHAVING PROPERLY AND COMPANIES TO DOING THE SAME WITH THAT I WOULD ASK YOUR I'VE.

UNFORTUNATELY RIGHT NOW ALTHOUGH EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE AN ACCOMMODATION FOR A WOMAN -- TO EXPRESSED BREAST MILK ARE THE STANDARDS OF VERY LOW BASICALLY THAT YOU CAN'T FORCE THEM INTO OSCILLATORY WHAT WILL THEY DO IT AND I THINK WE WANT TO TAKE IT UP A NOTCH [inaudible] FIRES ARE EMPLOYERS BUT BEHALF. ON PROVIDE A A PRIVATE SPACE -- FOR FOR THE SKIN FOR BREAST MARIN LACTATION TO OCCUR -- AND I NEED YOU CAN BE A ROOM A COULD BE A TEMPORARY STRUCTURE CREATES A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY -- IN THE BILL NOT WITH A TABLE AND A CHAIR AND WITH OUR REFRIGERATOR SOMEWHERE NEARBY -- SO THAT I AYE SHE CAN STORE THE% MILK AFTER ON LACTATING -- THAT ARE BILL -- ALSO REQUIRES THAT FOR I KNEW A CONSTRUCTION OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND SQUARE FEET -- THE BUILDING CODES I WILL HAVE TO BE UPDATED OUT TO MAKE SURE THE BUILDINGS FROM THE OUTSIDE. HAVE THE SPACE UP THERE'S A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY FOR EXAMPLE COMMERCIAL TENANTS IN A MULTI SPACE OFFICE BUILDING A MALL OR ABLE TO SHARE -- LACTATION -- SPACES OF IT ALL OUGHT TO HAVE THEIR OWN BUT AS I MENTIONED IF YOU ARE UNDER A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY FOR EXAMPLE REALLY SMALL RETAIL SPACE.

OUR CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY UP THERE IS A LOT POTENTIAL HARDSHIP EXEMPTS EXEMPTION FOR ANY EMPLOYER UP TO FIFTY EMPLOYEES. IBEC CAN BE LITIGATED EITHER -- WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER OR IN COURT ABOUT EMPLOYEE DISPUTES THE HARDSHIP. THE CLAIM OF HARDSHIP BY THE EMPLOYER OUGHT BUT AGAIN WHICH IS WHEN WE GET SOME LEVEL OF OUR FLEXIBILITY -- V. I BILL ALSO ARE -- PROTECTS OUR PEOPLE FROM RETALIATION -- FOR CLAIMING THESE RIGHTS -- AND ALSO REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT OUGHT TO ISSUE ON BEST PRACTICES OFFER LACTATION ACCOMMODATION IS BEST PRACTICES WOULD NOT BE BINDING ON WE'VE INCLUDED A PROVISION THAT YOU CAN'T USE. IT AS EVIDENCE AND THE LOSS TO AND OTHER WORDS WE DON'T IS NOT MEANT. TO FORCE BUSINESSES TO COMPLY BUT FOR BUSINESSES THAT DO WANT TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND THE LEGAL MINIMUM. OUT WE WANT THE STATE TO PROVIDE THAT GUIDANCE ON WHAT GOD ABOVE AND BEYOND IS. ODD SO -- COLLEAGUES SO THIS IS A AN OVERDUE BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE -- WITH ME TODAY OUR IDENTITY GARY. AND DR I FROM THE CALIFORNIA BREASTFEEDING BECAUSE THANK YOU. I'M -- MY NAME IS A KICKER ALLY I REPRESENT HEALTH CHRISTIAN COALITION [inaudible] COME CHAIRMAN. TERMIN AND MEMBERS OF THE CULT FOR BREASTFEEDING COALITION IS PLEASED. TO S. COSPONSORED THIS BILL -- BECAUSE IT ADDRESSES BARRIERS FACED BY NEW PARENTS. WHO RETURNED TO WORK AFTER BIRTH THEIR BABIES -- A SPEED NINE THIRTY SEVEN ADDRESSES BERRIES THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN BREASTFEEDING. WHILE JUGGLING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF RETURNING TO WORK AND WISHING TO PROVIDE THE BEST PATRICIA POSSIBLE. FOR THE NEWBORNS -- INDISCREET NINE THIRTY SEVEN PROVIDES MUCH NEEDED GUIDANCE TO EMPLOYERS ON HOW TO SUPPORT ELECTED EMPLOYEES TO INCREASE PRESSING DURATION. WHICH IN RETURN WOULD BENEFIT THE BOTTOM LINE OF BUSINESS IS BY DECREASING. WORKER ABSENTEEISM. RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT. HUMAN MILK IS THE BEST SOURCE OF NUTRITION. FOR INFANTS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO IMPROVE THE WORKPLACE. TO SUPPORT MOTHERS TO GIVE ONLY PRESIDENT TO THEIR INFANTS FOR THE FIRST MONTHS OF THERE BABY'S LIFE AND TO CONTINUE PROVIDE. BREASTMILK FOR THE FOR AT LEAST THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE. AND THIS IS THE IT THAT THIS IS AGREED UPON BY. ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION IN AMERICAN ACCOUNT PEDIATRICS. WRESTLING REDUCES ALL SO RISK AVERSE MANY SHORTEN LONG TERM HEALTH CONDITIONS. BOTH FOR INFANTS AND THEIR MOTHERS. FOR INFANTS BREASTFEEDING CONTRIBUTES TO DECREASE RISK OF EAR INFECTIONS DIARRHEA PNEUMONIA [inaudible] GASTROENTERITIS IN ITS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE SOCIAL WITH DECREASED RISK OF SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME WHICH IS. AFFLICTING OF MANY COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. FOR MOTHER'S BREAST REALLY PROVIDES TREMENDOUS HEALTH BENEFITS. INCLUDING DECREASE RISK OF DEVELOPING TYPE TWO DIABETES. DECREASE RISK FOR BREAST AND OVARIAN CANCER. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND HIGH CHOLESTEROL. FOR PARENTS OF BABIES BORN PREMATURELY. BREASTFEEDING IS OF VERY SPECIFIC IMPORTANCE. BECAUSE IT SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASES THE RISK OF NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS WHICH IS AN ILLNESS STAT. AFFLICTS MANY PREMATURE BABIES WHO ARE IN THE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT FOR MONTHS. AND AND AND PREVENTS THEIR DEATH. IF -- 90% OF CALIFORNIA WOMEN WHERE ABLE TO BREASTFEED IN ACCORDANCE WITH RECOMMENDATIONS. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WOULD BE SAVED. ONE STUDY ESTIMATED SAVINGS AT OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. OF DIRECT HEALTHCARE COSTS ANNUALLY. BREASTFEEDING IS GOOD FOR BUSINESS. EMPLOYERS WOULD LACTATION SUPPORT PROGRAMS HAVE EXPERIENCE HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY. EMPLOYEE JOB SATISFACTION MORALE AND ENHANCE LOYAL TO THEIR COMPANY. ELECTIVE XIN SUPPORT PROGRAM CAN BE IN ADDED RECRUITMENT INCENTIVE FOR FEMALE EMPLOYEES. AND CAN HIT ENHANCE A COMPANY'S IMAGE IN THE COMMUNITY. I THINK THIS TOPIC IS ONE OF THOSE ISSUES WHERE THAT THE INTERESTS OF THE EMPLOYEES. AND EMPLOYERS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ORAL FELLOW LINES. POLY AND HEAR OF MY TESTIMONY AND ASK FOR YOUR HIGH WALLS. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE ARMONK AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JENNA GARY AND AN ATTORNEY WITH LEGAL AID AWARE WHERE A NONPROFIT PUBLIC INTEREST LEGAL ORGANIZATION. THAT ADVOCATE ON THE RIGHT ON BEHALF OF LOW WAGE WORKERS. SOME ANA BE HERE TODAY AS A CO SPONSOR EXPRESSED STRONG SUPPORT FOR S. B. NINE THIRTY SEVEN AND I WANT TO THANK SENATOR WIENER. FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. SIMPLY PUT SB NINE THIRTY SEVEN BUTCHER ALL LACTATING PARENT ABLE TO MEET THE MOST BASIC NEED OF THEIR CHILD'S [inaudible] PROVIDING FOOD. AT LEGALLY THAT WHERE WE HAVE A WORKING FAMILY HELP LINE WHERE WE HEAR FROM ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH BEING PARENTS AND EMPLOYEES. AND FAR TOO OFTEN WE HEAR FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO LACK PROPER. ADEQUATE LACTATION SUPPORTS FOR EXAMPLE I JUST WANNA SHARE ONE STORY OF OUR CLIENT TARA. CHARACTERS A WAITRESS AT A RESTAURANT WHICH HAD OUR FIRST CHILD. AFTER RETURNING TO WORK TARA WANTED TO CONTINUE BREASTFEEDING HER CHILD. AND ASK YOUR EMPLOYER FOR LACTATION ACCOMMODATIONS. UNFORTUNATE HARRIS TOLD THE ONLY SPACE HAD WAS A REFRIGERATED ONE ROOM WITH NO ACCESS TO ELECTRICITY. NO PLACE TO SAID NO PLACE TO PUT THE PALM. AND SUCH IS LEFT WITH THE SOLE OPTION OF EITHER STOPPING BREAST FEEDING HER QUITTING HER JOB AND RISKING SEVERE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. EMPLOYERS ARE NOT BILL THETAKE THAT DECISION AWAY FROM A NEW PARENT. S. B. NINE THIRTY WILL OPEN JAPAN'S LIKE TARA ARE ABLE TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN. S. B. NINE THIRTY SEVEN PRIDE SIMPLE SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL DISPARITIES IN HEALTH AND EQUITY. THAT WERE DISCUSSED HERE TODAY BY ALIGNING MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THE SPACE AND PRACTICES THAT WILSHIRE WORKERS RECEIVE SUPPORT OF LACTATION ACCOMMODATIONS. STUDIES SHOW THAT SIX MONTHS EMPLOYED PARENTS RECEIVE LACTATION ABOUT AGENTS. TWO POINT THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO EXCLUSIVELY BREASTFEED. COMPARED TO THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE LACTATION SUPPORTS AT WORK. SIMILARLY AT SIX MONTHS EMPLOYED PARENTS RECEIVE BREASTFEEDING COMBINATIONS ARE ONE POINT FIVE TIMES AS LIKELY TO EXCLUSIVELY BREASTFEED WITH EACH PASSING MONTH COMPARED OF THOSE WHO DON'T. THAT'S FOR THESE REASONS REVIEW RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION TO SUPPORT BREASTFEEDING PARENTS AND THEIR CHILDREN. A FEW OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON SUPPORT.

SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD [inaudible] PLEASE PROCEED. HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON LARA CURTIS CAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE HERE ON AND OPPOSE MUST AMENDED POSITION ON THIS BILL AND WE DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH AND THE AUTHOR AND FOR WORKING WITH US SO MUCH ON THIS BILL -- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON AMEND AMENDMENTS BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE AND WERE AT THEIR STILL OUTLINED CONCERNS AND THAT HAVEN'T BEEN AT TAKING CARE OF IT. AT THIS POINT THE BIGGEST ONE IS THE BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS RIGHT NOW SO THIS BILL AS THE SENATOR SAID WAS STRUCTURED AFTER SAN FRANCISCO ORDINANCE BUT AS YOU ALL KNOW SAN FRANCISCO IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE REST OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO THINGS THAT OCCUR IN HUMANS IS GO DON'T ALWAYS WORK FOR THE REST OF THE STATE AND M. AIDS A FROM THE STATISTICS THAT WE'VE RECEIVED AS IT WOULD COST EMPLOYERS APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST TO MAKE A VERY BASIC LACTATION ROOM. AN ADDITION IT'S GOING TO COST EMPLOYERS AT APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR MAINTENANCE OF THAT ROOM ANNUALLY AND SO THAT'S OUR BIGGEST CONCERN I'M IS THE COST FOR THESE WHILE THE BILL DOES ALLOW FOR A TEMPORARY STRUCTURE. IT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR A TEMPORARY STRUCTURE IF YOU HAVE A REMODEL THE MILLION DOLLARS OR IF YOU ARE AND THAT SPACES FIFTEEN THOUSAND SQUARE FEET. SO THE TEMPORARY STRUCTURE ONLY ALLOWS. FOR THAT WON'T BE MAKING UPGRADES ADDITIONALLY IN SAN FRAN SAN FRANCISCO ORDINANCE THERE IS NOT A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND OUR BIGGEST CONCERN IS THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BECAUSE OF THE LITIGATION THAT WILL COME FROM THIS. EVEN IF YOU WERE TO PROVIDE AN ACCOMMODATION TO THE MOTHER UNDER THIS BILL YOU COULD STILL BE CAUGHT UP IN LITIGATION OVER THE VERY TECHNICAL ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE THE MAINTENANCE OF THE RECORDS AND THE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND AND ISSUES LIKE THAT. AND SO WE'VE ASKED THAT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BE STRUCK AS WELL AS THE BUILDING CODE CONSTRUCTION AND THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES WITH THE BILL WE OF COURSE WOULD STILL HAVE. OTHER AND CLARIFYING LANGUAGE THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK ON BUT THOSE ARE TWO BIGGEST CONCERNS THANKS SO MUCH AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO THEY Q. OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON OPPOSITION. FAVORING BORDERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWER AUTHORITIES WOULD ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THOSE MISS CURTIS RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE MUST MANDATE [inaudible] IF YOU. REX W.

AND THE CALL RICE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO POSE LISTEN AND BAKE YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO OPPOSE I HAVE A QUESTION -- FOR THE CHAMBER IN THEIR OPPOSITION -- BUT IT IT WHILE THEY COME FORWARD AND THE OTHER MEMBERS WITH QUESTION OR A COMMENT FOR DISCUSSION. ASSEMBLYMEMBER JONES SAWYER. OKAY AND THANK YOU I'M ACTUALLY I BOTH PERSONAL AND A AND BUCKET A PROFESSIONAL QUESTION. SO WHAT I'M. OPTIONS I'M A PROUD GRANDFATHER WITH THE NEW. WITH A VERY NEW A GRANDSON WHO'S ABOUT THREE MONTHS AND HE'S VERY HEALTHY BECAUSE OF BREAST MILK. WHILE MY DAUGHTER IS A TEACHER IN LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. SO I'M I HEARD CTA IF SCHOOL DURING FOR OFFICIAL DISTANCE COVER GOVERNMENTAL. IT'S CHILLY SO WILL THIS FACILITY AFTER COMING DEADLINES ALSO. YES AND ALL SCHOOL YES. OKAY DOT CORRECT AND AT LEAST. FIRE STATIONS -- EVERYONE WILL HAVE TO BE IN COMPLIANCE AND IN FACT THE AS THE CHAMBER INDICATED -- THEY TALK ABOUT THE SAN FRANCISCO ART ORDINANCE NAM OF COURSE OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CANNOT TELL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WHAT TO DO THROUGH SAN FRANCISCO ORDINANCE DOES NOT COVER OF SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT? ARE AND SO THERE IS A REAL VALUE FOR FOR EXAMPLE TO DOING THIS AT THE STATE LEVEL. DAY AND THEN ON A PROFESSIONAL IT PROBABLY [inaudible] MAYBE THAT. MAYBE ONLY PERSON IN THIS WHOLE BUILDING. THAT'S EVER MANAGE THE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT HAD TO PUT IN BOTH LACTATION AND DIAPER CHANGING FACILITIES EN A COMMERCIAL BUILDING. AND MAKING SURE I DO REMEMBER -- CITY COUNCIL BEING VERY VERY. ANXIOUS TO GET THIS DONE VERY HAPPY TO GET THIS DONE. AND THEN WHEN I PRESENTED THAT BUDGET BILL ALL THE SUDDEN AIRBASE ARE LOOKING. IN A POINT FINGERS AND ONE TO TAKE MONEY OUT OF MY*. AND ALSO WE COULD AFFORD IT. AND SELL OUT I AM. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING SURE. IT CAN GET DONE -- AND AND HOPEFULLY YOU'VE PUT IN ENOUGH MEASURES AND I THINK THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE'RE GOING WHERE WE CAN. WE GET THIS DONE COULD THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS. TO HAVE THE ABILITY ON YOUNG MOTHERS TO PROVIDE UP BREAST MILK TO TO TWO YOUNG KIDS I'M EVEN. IBM PUT MY BILL MY OWN TO BOOK SO THAT I'M. INCARCERATED WOMEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO PRODUCE BREASTMILK AND GIVE TO THEIR GIVE THEIR CHILDREN AND EXCITING UP OTHERS IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT -- BUT ALSO KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO CHANGE THE BATHROOM AND TO THAT I WOULD LIKE TO CLEANLINESS. BEING ABLE TO MAINTAIN IT -- IF YOU PUT ONE IN I HAD THREE SERVICES IF YOU PUT ONE IN A MAINTENANCE YARD OR FLEET MAINTENANCE YARD. FULLER MAKE SURE. NO IS MOSTLY MALE WHICH GREECE AND POLLUTE FOR MOST PART NARAL CLEAN PLACE THAT IF THEY DO HAVE A YOUNG WOMAN. WORKING THERE WHO HAD A CHILD THAT. IT WILL BE MAINTAINED ON UP TO A STANDARD WHERE. ARM WHICH IS NOT HEALTHY AT ALL AND SO ON I DON'T IF ANYTHING I THINK SHE IS AS CLEAN AND HEALTHY I DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED. TO MAKE SURE THAT IT COMES TO A CERTAIN LEVEL BUT MORE IMPORTANT OF WORKING WITH THE PEOPLE HAVE DONE THIS AND I'M SORRY IF YOU JUST EARLIER TO TALK ABOUT TO MAKE SURE -- WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THIS DONE GETTING IS MORE IMPORTANT TO TO IMPLEMENT IT. ARM WHICH DEATHLY IMPORTANT I MAKE THE LAWLER POLICY BUT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TEST TO MAKE SURE WE CAN IMPLEMENT. YEAH NO I DIED TOTALLY AGREE WILL GO BACK TO GO LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE. THERE COULD BE. DISPUTES IN AND WE DON'T YOU KNOW OPPOSED PUREE WE DON'T WANT. LITIGATION TOOKER AND I I SUSPECTED THAT IT WON'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN. UNDER THIS BILL BUT WITHOUT THE PUREE THERE'S VERY LITTLE INCENTIVE. FOR COMPLIANCE BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY ON THE COMPLAINT SYSTEM AT THE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER IS NOT -- IT'S NOT A FAST. ONE AND SO AND ACTUALLY WHEN WOMEN ARE. ARE EXPRESSING BREAST MILK IT'S FOR NOT PERMANENT PERIOD OF TIME AND SO -- RESOLUTION ON BUT YEAH WILL BOTH TAKE A LOOK AT THAT TO MAKE SURE IT'S ON TO MAKE SURE IT'S TIGHT ENOUGH AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE OUTFIT AND DIDN'T KNOW ALSO JUST LOOK AT WHAT WE DID FIRE DEPARTMENT. DARN A LOT OF WOMEN WHO FIREFIGHTERS. SO. THE TEMPORARY MAY HAVE MADE MORE SENSE. IT ONE STATION BECAUSE THEY ALSO MOVE FIREFIGHTERS AROUND PREGNANT SO PUTTING A PERMANENT ONE IN EVERY. SO WE WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT. DISCUSSIONS LIKE HOPEFULLY THERE'S NOT A FLEXIBILITY. OKAY THANK YOU. I GUESS I REMEMBER OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS -- I WOULD ASK THE QUESTION TO OPPOSITION YOU I NOTE THAT YOU. THE CHAMBERS CONCERN IS ABOUT THE BUILDING CODE IN AUNT AND HUNCHED RUSSIAN. PORTIONS HERE -- I DIDN'T HEAR CONCERNS ABOUT. THE GOLDEN ATTENDED THE BILL I'M ASSUMING THAT. THERE ARE NO CONCERNS THERE -- I GUESS TONIGHT* IT YOU KNOW IT WOULDN'T BE THE TIME TO MAKE ELECTION ACCOMMODATION IF YOU'RE MAKING NEW CONSTRUCTION WOULD THAT BE. PRECISELY THE TIME -- TO DO SUCH A THING SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT BUT NO AGAIN AS I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBER DON'T ARTS JONES SAWYER STATED NOT EVERY BUILDING IS THE SAME NOT EVERY BUILDING IS USED FOR THE SAME PURPOSE AS A NIGHT I DON'T KNOW THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. BUT I CAN SAY THAT THE CONCERN IS THE CHOIR MEANT TO PUT THIS ON EVERY NEW CONSTRUCTION JOB THAT HAS THESE REQUIREMENTS. I'M IS GOING TO BE EXTREMELY COSTLY TO THESE EMPLOYERS WHERE WERE THE REST OF THE BILL DOES ALLOW FOR A TEMPORARY STRUCTURE IF THE NEW CONSTRUCTION IS OCCURRING THEN YOU HAVE TO PUT THIS IN WITHOUT THE CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS IN. THIS SPACE IS GOING TO BE UTILIZED. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS IN THE DISCUSSION IS OUR MOTION. BILL'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED THANK YOU SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

FOURTEEN TWENTY EIGHT WELCOME PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY DOING WELL WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMMENTED YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A BUSY DAY FOR EVERYONE. I AM. VERY GRATEFUL TO BE IN A PRISON S. B.. FOURTEEN TWENTY EIGHT KNOWING HOW HARD IT IS TO KEEP A JOB -- THIS IS WHY WE'RE ADVANCING THIS IMPORTANT BILL. I'M BE NEVER KEEP A JOB IS A CRITICAL SKILL FOR STUDENTS. PREPARE FOR ADULTHOOD BUT AS YOU MAY KNOW. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES CALIFORNIA MINER'S TO HAVE WORKED FOR ME IN ORDER TO SECURE A POSITION. THESE WORK PERMITS ARE REQUIRED REGARDLESS OF THE TIME HERE. EVEN DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS OR SCHOOL BREAKS. AND WHILE SCHOOL DISTRICTS MAY SET THEIR OWN POLICIES ON SCHOOL PERMITS. SOME POLICIES REQUIRE STUDENTS TO HAVE A CERTAIN GRADE POINT AVERAGE OR ATTENDANCE RATE. AS A RESULT STUDENTS CAN BE UNFAIRLY DENIED PARTICIPATION IN SUMMER WORK. SUCH AS PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY INTENDED FOR LOW INCOME IN DISADVANTAGED YOUTH. THE CALVARY TRIBAL PAINT A PARTNERSHIP FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD THEIR AMAZING. DECKER DIRECTOR RIGHT NEXT TO ME OFFER SUBSIDIZE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRIBAL YOUTH. DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. UNFORTUNATELY THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL CASES WHERE STUDENTS ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN WORK PERMITS BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEY FAILED TO MEET. THE GPA OR TENANTS REQUIREMENTS AND THEREFORE HAVE BEEN DENIED WORK PERMITS IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE IN SUMMER PROGRAMS. FITNESS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THESE IT AMERICAN STUDENTS. WE MUST HELP ADVANCE STUDENTS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO WANT TO GAIN WORK EXPERIENCE. S. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY EIGHT IS SIMPLE IT'S GONNA REMOVE THE BARRIER FOR MINORS TO OBTAIN A WORK PERMIT. JUST DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS BY PROHIBITING THE DENIAL OF A WORK PERMIT ON THE BASIS OF A STUDENT'S GRADES. GRADE POINT AVERAGE OR SCHOOL ATTENDANCE IF THE STUDENT IS APPLYING PER WORK PERMIT TO TO PRINT TO PARTICIPATE NAY GOVERN ADMINISTERED EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING FOR PROGRAM. SOME EXAMPLES OF THOSE. THE YOUTH CONSERVATION COURSE OR LIKE IN THE COUNTY WHERE I LIVE IN WE HAVE A YOU PSYCHOLOGY COURSE THROUGH THE CINEMA COUNTY WATER AGENCY. CALIFORNIA YOUTH BUILD I IT'S SUPPORTED BY GENERAL FUND DOLLARS HERE IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA. TRIBAL TEEN OF SUMMER YOUTH EMPLOYMENT OR YOUTH EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY PROGRAMS OR SERVICES AND PROGRAMS VERY BY COUNTY MANY OF US ALREADY HAVE THEM IN OUR REGION. S. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY EIGHT IS AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT WILL HELP STUDENTS WHO WANT TO IMPROVE THEMSELVES. AND LIFT UP THEIR FAMILIES THROUGH EMPLOYMENT I'VE TO INCREDIBLE WOMEN HERE TODAY I IN VERY GRATEFUL FOR THEIR WORK WE'VE LAURIE LEWIS EDUCATION DIRECTOR FOR THE TRIP CALVET TRAVEL TENNIS PARTNERSHIP IN OF COURSE.

AND WE HAVE OTHER STUDENTS WHO -- OBVIOUSLY LIVE ON THE RESERVATION. CARE THAT THE OLDEST MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD THEY HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF FIVE OR SIX OTHER SIBLINGS WHICH MIGHT ENTITLE THEM GETTING NO SIBLINGS THE SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY'RE LIVING WITH THE GRANDPARENT. AND THEREFORE THEY ARE MARKED TRUANT -- EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE STILL MAINTAINING THEIR GRADES BUT THEY TOO WERE DENIED FOR THEIR WORK PERMITS THAT THEY'RE UNABLE TO ATTEND OUR PROGRAMS. ARE PROGRAMS WOULD SUPPORT THEM -- AND MAKING SURE THEY HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AS OTHER STUDENTS WHO DO WHO HAVE THE THING YOU KNOW SIMILAR OPPORTUNITIES BUT WITHOUT THE SAME CHALLENGES.

OF THE POLICIES THE BUZZ -- SCHOOL DISTRICT BY SCHOOL DISTRICT WE WANT TO FIND OUT HOW MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS MAKE CONCESSIONS FOR AND WORK WITH STUDENTS SO THAT THEY CAN GET ABOVE THE GRADE POINT AVERAGE OR OR IT WHETHER OR NOT THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAD ACCESS -- TO RESEARCH SHOULD SHOW THAT LOW INCOME -- STUDENTS WHO DO PARTICIPATE IN A SUMMER YOUTH EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PROGRAM ARE MORE LIKELY TO ACCEPT POVERTY -- AND WOOD WE FOUND A YOU KNOW A LACK OF OF INFORMATION WHICH WAS DISHEARTENING -- BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW ABOUT THESE -- FOR WHEN THEY ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BUILT -- TO EMPOWER LOW INCOME YOU OFFER THEM AT AGE APPROPRIATE -- EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING AT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THEM BEING ABLE TO ACCEPT POVERTY AND IS IS HIGHER AND ALSO. THE YOUTH ARE MORE LIKELY TO MEET SOME OF THE BASIC NEEDS WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM LOW INCOME YOUTH WHO ARE EMPLOYED AS AT MANY OF THEM ARE YOU ARE USING THAT EMPLOYMENT INCOME TO HELP -- BUOY AS THE HOUSEHOLDS FOOD INCOME -- SOMETIMES HELP PAY FOR RENT AND PREVENT EVICTION -- IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THAT'S A THAT'S HOW YOUTH HAVE TO SPEND THEIR MONEY -- BUT IT ALSO THAT CAN KEEP THEM IN SCHOOL IF THEY'RE NOT HOMELESS -- AND KEEP THEM FROM SUFFERING AT THE INDIGNITY OF HUNGER OF THIS WAS MY OWN EXPERIENCE WITH A WORK PERMIT AND AND SO I UNDERSTAND IT WELL -- FOR THESE REASONS WE WE REALLY -- ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THE BILL IN A PARTNERSHIP WITH TRAVEL TEN F. -- AND JR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. SEE NOT IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. SEEN ON TIME TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SOME AND NEVER GONZALEZ FLETCHER SO I ASKED HER TO PEOPLE OF CONSENT AND WE HAVE A HISTORY OF DISCUSSING. YOUTH WORK PERMITS YOU AND I MISTER MCGUIRE -- SO I WANTED TO KNOW MORE I A WAS LOOKED ALARMED -- I I THINK THAT WE HAVE YOUTH WORK PERMITS FOR A REASON -- WE HAVE A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT IS A CHANGING THE LAWS AROUND OR ARE SEEKING TO CHANGE LAWS AROUND. AND CHILD LABOR LAWS AND WE HAVE SOME THE STRONGEST NATION I APPRECIATE THAT WE WORKED HARD FOR THAT. BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND -- DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND NEEDS FOR CHANGES SO I I WANTED TO HEAR MORE AND I APPRECIATE THIS PROGRAM MY CONCERN WITH THE BILL IS. HOW BROAD IT IS AND I ASKED MY STAFF I'D ASK? YOUR STAFF I THINK FOR EXAMPLES IN EVEN WHEN YOU SAY YOU FELT IT KIND OF MADE MY EARS PERK UP THEY RANDY IS BILL PROGRAM -- AND IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SITUATION BECAUSE IT SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLDS WHO HAVE NO ATTACHMENT TO A SCHOOL. SO IT PROBABLY WOULD APPLY IN A YOUTH BUILD SITUATION BECAUSE OF THE YOUTH ARE ACTUALLY IN. GETTING A G. E. D. OR A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AT THE SAME TIME AS THEY'RE IN THIS PROGRAM SO THAT PROGRAM. THAT THE WORK PERMIT COMES FROM THAT SCHOOL. I THINK A BIGGER CONCERN IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE STATEWIDE RULES AROUND IT SO IT THIS IS EITHER. IN MY OPINION NOT BROAD ENOUGH BECAUSE IT'S NOT ESTABLISHING WHAT THAT CRITERIA SHOULD BE -- AND TO ENSURE THAT WERE NOT -- ALLOWING NOT IN THIS SITUATION BUT IN SOME SITUATIONS YOU CAN IMAGINE WHERE -- YOUNG PEOPLE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EMPLOYERS UTILIZE A YOUNG PEOPLE WHO THE ATTENDANCE THING KIND OF CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD BECAUSE I MEAN IF YOUR ATTENDANCE IS BAD AND AND WHERE ALLOWING YOU TO WORK AND THEN YOU AFTER ADDITIONAL -- EXCEPTION FTA TO WORK LONGER AND MORE HOURS THAN YOU KNOW THAT YOUR LIMITED EXCEPTION FOR YOUR LAST BILL THAT WE WE HAD TALKED ABOUT. WE'RE CREATING KIND OF A PATCHWORK OF OF EXCEPTIONS FOR PERMITS THAT -- WORK PERMITS MEET ME I'M INCREASINGLY NERVOUS AND SO. AS I'M I THINK I'M A STAY OFF THIS TODAY I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS -- IT'S GOOD APPROPRIATIONS AND SOME [inaudible] NOW. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESOLVE MY MY CONCERNS ARE OBVIOUSLY EVERYTHING THE BOTH OF YOU SAID I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH I JUST AM WONDERING KIND OF WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THIS. AND I WOULD BE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE EITHER ST FOR THIS PROGRAM. THIS IS THE EXCEPTION ON YOU FOR FOR TRIBAL YOUTH I I'VE BEEN. YOU KNOW PRETTY COMFORTABLE WITH THAT I I THINK -- IF WE CREATED A STATEWIDE STANDARD FOR WHAT OH BY USE WORK PERMIT LOOKS LIKE I'D BE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT -- BUT I I'M HAVING A HARD TIME YOU YOU CREATED VERY. BROAD BILL IN A SENSE THAT COULD. CREATE SITUATIONS I THINK THAT ARE MAKING ME NERVOUS. NO I I APPRECIATE AND I WANNA FIRST FAULT THINK THESE IN THE ONE FOR ALL FOR WORK PARTICULAR FOR BUTTE IN WORKING FAMILIES RIGHT THERE IS NO GREATER CHAMPION. AND AND THEN I I WILL ALSO SAY THAT WE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO LIMIT THIS BILL FROM WHERE WE WERE IN THE BEGINNING. SO NUMBER ONE WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY DEFINITION OF WHAT A WORK PERMIT -- WOULD BE AS FAR AS WHAT IS CURRENTLY BUT CURRENTLY QUALIFIES HERE IN THE STATE. YEAH WE DID NEARLY SO NUMBER ONE I STUDENTS CAN ONLY PARTICIPATE IN YOUTH WORK PROGRAMS THAT RECEIVE GOVERNMENT FUNDING. SO THEY CAN'T GO OUT AND WORK AT STARBUCKS. THEY HAVE TO BE A WORK WITH ANY GOVERNMENT FUNDED -- USE WORK PROGRAM. BUT WHEN THE QUESTION AT LEAST YOUR OTHER PROGRAM THAT WE ALLOWED I'M AN EXCEPTION REPAIRS THAT'S NOT CONSIDERED A SOMEHOW BECAUSE THEY HAVE AS SPECIALS EXEMPTION. CORRECT IN SO THEY DON'T RECEIVE GOVERNMENT FUNDING OF HER THAT I IT'S IT'S AN ADMINISTERED IT'S OVERSEEN BY THE OFFICE EDUCATION BUT THEY DON'T RECEIVE ANY FUNDING ANY GOVERNMENT APPLYING FOR THAT OKAY. ON THE SECOND PIECE IS WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL YOUR LONG WHEN THIS BILL WAS ORIGINALLY I NIGHT WE'VE NOW JUST LIMITED TO SUMMER MONTHS. AND SO IT'S JUST FOR THIS DE SUMMER -- MINDS -- IN AGAIN IT'S JUST ON THE SAME REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN PLACE UP FOR YOUTH ACROSS THE STATE. BUT AGAIN FOR THIS SPECIFIC BILL JUST GOVERNMENT FUNDING -- IS WELL IT'S JUST A SUMMER MONTHS. YOU I'M SORRY I KNOW WE'RE NOT. FOURTH KNOW IT'S PLEASE PLEASE MISTER CHAIR ALLOW ME TO HOUSES IS THERE IS THIS ANY YEARS WORK PERMIT. OF ANY AGE FOR HIGH SCHOOL. SO THEY HAVE TO BE IN HIGH SCHOOL I THINK I MISSED THAT SO THAT WAS. SO BAD BUT I AS I WOULD BE FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN IT COULD BE IF YOU'RE. YES IT COULD BE. SO I WHAT I DO WANT TO FRAME UP SOMETHING AND THAT IS THAT. SO. WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY. SO WHAT WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO IS IT WOULD SAY -- YOU STILL HAVE TO GET A WORK PERMIT. THE WORK MY PERMIT STILL HAVE TO MEET ALL OF THE THE RULES -- AND THOSE INCLUDE ALL OF THE PROTECTIONS FOR YOUTH WORKERS -- BUT BUT YOU CAN'T DENY THAT USE A SUMMER LA LA A SUMMER MONTHS WORK PERMIT. FOR A GOVERNMENT FUNDED EMPLOYMENT YOUTH EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PROGRAM. IT IT JUST SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF THEIR GRADES AND ATTENDANCE DURING THE SCHOOL YEARS. IF OUR SCHOOL SCHOOL MONTHS IF YOU CAN DENY IT BECAUSE THE PLACE WHERE YOU'VE APPLIED TO WORK. DOESN'T MEET THE STANDARDS YEAH -- YOU COULD DO THAT YOU CAN'T DENY IT SOLELY ON THE FACT THAT THEY GOT POOR GRADES DURING THE SCHOOL MONTH AND THEN GIVE THEM NO OPPORTUNITY IN THE SUMMER MONTHS -- AND AND THAT'S THAT THE VERY NARROW PIECE THAT THIS BILL IS CURRENTLY DOING. I THINK YOUR QUESTION THOUGH IS A DOES THAT MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE -- OF A NOTE BY SAYING GOVERNMENT IS THAT IS THAT A GOOD ENOUGH STANDARD -- I THINK WHEN WE TALKED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR IN THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED WITHOUT YES -- BUT TODAY WERE HONORING REFUGEES AND WERE LOOKING AT WHAT'S HAPPENING AT OUR BORDER. IT I'M NOT SURE THAT WE CAN WITH CONFIDENCE SAY THAT A FEDERAL WORK PROGRAM UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION -- WOULD A PROTECT TO USE I THINK YOUR QUESTIONS ARE GOOD -- ONE AND IT'S ONE WE DIDN'T AND I WOULD ADD ONE MORE IN THERE TO CONSIDER AS WE MOVE FORWARD I AM REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT ON THIS. NOW SAYING THAT. I'M NOT SURE WE CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WITHOUT INCLUDING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. PROGRAMS RIGHT RIGHT I WOULD ASSUME THAT THIS IS A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROGRAM YET DID ABSOLUTELY AS TONIGHT I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT ONE THING BECAUSE I AM ACTUALLY THE PERSON WHO GOES OUT. AND WORK WITH THE YOUTH. AND THIS BECAME A VERY BIG CHALLENGE BECAUSE I SPEND THE MAJORITY OF MY TIME DURING THIS TIME OF THE YEAR. GOING TO SCHOOL DISTRICT AFTER SCHOOL DISTRICT NOT JUST IN ONE AREA BUT I SERVICE OF ALL COUNTIES FROM SAN JOAQUIN TO MODOC TO DOWN OR AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. AND THE CONSTANT CHALLENGES IS THAT OUR SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE A SUMMER PROGRAM FOR OUR STUDENTS THERE ARE NO SUMMER SCHOOLS THERE'S NO SUMMER CLASSES THERE'S NOTHING FOR THE YOU'VE TO DO. AND THEN THEY DENIED THE YOUTH A WORK PERMIT SO I HAVE A I GREW A GROUP OF YOUTHS WHO WERE AGES. FOURTEEN TO EIGHTEEN WHO WERE SITTING IN THE SUMMER WHO ARE NOW DISCOURAGED BECAUSE THEY CANNOT WORK THEY'RE NOT DOING WELL IN SCHOOL THEY CANNOT DO ANYTHING AND NOW WE'RE FIGHTING TO KEEP THEM OFF DRUGS TO KEEP THEM ENGAGED IN TO KEEP THEM BACK. SCHOOL SO FOR THAT IT IT'S VERY PASSIONATE AND EVEN THOUGH WE ARE TRIBAL COMMUNITY WE WORK WITH ALL STUDENTS SO WE HAVE MANY OF YOUTHS WHO COME INTO OUR PROGRAM WITH FRIENDS AND WE WORK WITH THEM BECAUSE WE WANT THEM TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. THAT IS I HOPE THAT HELPS THAT HELP IN AYE LIKE IF AND I'M. I DON'T THINK I EVER OPPOSE THE WESTERN CENTER THE WHOLE -- SAID THIS IS TOP I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T FIND OURSELVES IN A POSITION. ON THAT WE'VE ALLOWED A LOOPHOLE. I I WILL SUPPORT THE STATE I WILL ASK FOR TWO THINGS ONE THAT THAT WE REVISIT THIS QUESTION ON ON THE FEDERAL -- I'M PROTECTIONS UNDER FEDERAL PROGRAMS ON JUST IN CASE THINGS CHANGE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS FAR AS PROTECTIONS. AND THE SECOND BEING I'M I CAN'T. I'M TRYING I CAN THINK OF AN EXAMPLE OF A OF A ENTERTAINMENT WORK PERMIT THAT WOULD FALL UNDER ONE THESE CATEGORIES BUT I'D LIKE THEM EXEMPTED FROM THE SPELL -- BECAUSE THAT. THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT WORK WITH WORK PERMIT AND SCHOOLING ON THE SAT AND AND THE FACT THAT IT'S YEAR ROUND AND IT'S NOT THAT. I I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THEIR THIRD DOESN'T BECOME A LOCAL STATE OR FEDERAL PROGRAM -- AND YOU HAVE YOU KNOW. MY DAUGHTER HAD A WORK PERMIT. SADDAM YOU NOW AND THERE HAD TO BE A TUTOR ON SAT NIGHT I DON'T WANT THOSE FEES EXEMPTION SOMEHOW REPLIED AS THE THAT YOUNG AND IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT GROUP OF KIDS RIGHT SO. THAT WOULD BE MY ONLY REQUEST TREATMENT MY AND ONE ANIMAL ADDS THAT IS WILD TRAVEL TEAM IT DOES RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS THERE ARE STATE STANDARDS. THAT ADEN STUDENTS HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ABIDE BY OUT WHEN IT COMES TO THESE WORK PERMITS AND SO I THINK THAT THE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THAT IS. YES THEY'RE RECEIVING FEDERAL FUNDING BUT WE ALSO HAVE OUR OWN STATE STANDARDS AS WELL THANK. SO YOU WILL WORK WITH ME ON THOSE TWO QUESTIONS THEM FIVE ON THE ISSUE OF EXAM. SO. I MEAN I MIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH I MEAN I MIGHT LOOK BE LOOKING FOR SOLUTION WITHOUT A PROBLEM ON THE ENTERTAINMENT WORK PERMIT I JUST IT JUST IS A RED FLAG FOR ME BECAUSE THE RULES ARE SO DIFFERENT. AND IT IT IS THE WORK PERMIT THE GUY. BY DIFFERENT THAT WE CLASSIFIED AND AND THE DEFINITIONS HERE BUT YOU'VE PERMITS -- FOR FOR ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY THAT THE AGES GO MUCH LOWER SO I THINK THE ONE JUST BEING HONEST ABOUT THIS ONE CHALLENGE WE HAD ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE LOOKED AT GOVERNMENT FUNDED AND OR GOVERNMENT HOSTED WORK PERMIT PROGRAMS. I IS BECAUSE IT GOT OUT OF THE PRIVATE SIDE OF THE MARKET. I AND IF WE'RE GONNA. ONE CONCERN I WOULD HAVE IS IF WE'RE GOING TO EXEMPT ONE INDUSTRY THEN WE MAY HAVE ON IT OTHER INDUSTRIES COMING ASK FOR EXEMPTIONS THAT'S WHY WE TEND TO LOOK AT THOSE GOVERNMENT FUNDED GOVERNMENT RUN PROGRAMS -- WHAT I WOULD GET INTO THAT'S I DON'T WANNA SAY? ABSOLUTELY EXEMPTION ALL ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS JUST LOOK AT IT AND YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT SCHEDULE ME WITH YOU TO BE AND TALK MORE ABOUT IT BUT I'M NOT TRYING TO BE QUIET AND NOW BUT LET'S. LET'S BE CLEAR WHAT WE'RE ASKING EXEMPTION FROM AN EXEMPTION FROM EXEMPTING THEM FROM SCHOOL. RIGHT AND IT'S A DIFFERENT SITUATION MIGHT BE AT UNDER DIFFERENT WORK PERMIT BUT IT'S AN INDUSTRY THAT I AND I CAN'T IMAGINE [inaudible] I OF FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAM BUT THERE COULD BE ONE ESPECIALLY NOW ACTUALLY WITH THE FILM TAX CREDIT I THINK I REMEMBER THERE WAS DISCUSSIONS ABOUT CREATING AND PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM -- FOR I OUT SEE MEMBERS AND STUFF I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT -- TAKING AWAY WHAT HAS BEEN BUILT INTO THE ENTERTAINMENT WORK PERMITS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN THAT REQUIRE ON SET TUTORS AND SCHOOLING AND AND DIFFER ES DIFFERENT SET OF REQUIREMENTS BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL THAT. IN MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING WE GET THROUGH AND YOU CLEAN UP LANGUAGE ON BECAUSE I THINK THE FEDERAL. AND MAKE ENSURING AND I WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO IT WHAT THE FEDERAL WHAT'S GOOD CHANGES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO MAKE ON SOME OF THEIR PROGRAMS AND WHAT PROTECTIONS WE HAVE IN STATE LAW THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THIS THAT WE FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT THIS. WE'RE NOT GONNA END UP IN A SITUATION THAT'S I'M NOT PROTECTIVE OF CHILDREN IF THE COMMITTEE THAT AND WILL DO THE DEEPER DIVE ON THE ENTERTAINMENT SITE AND I JUST I AM NOT SURE. IN THIS WOULD ONLY PLAYED IN THE SUMMER IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS IT WOULD ONLY APPLY FOR THE SUMMER BUT LET'S DO A DEEPER DIVE NEAR MY COMMITMENT THAT WILL DO A DEEPER DIVE ON THE ISSUE. THAT IS NOT AN INTERFERE ON THAT CAN THOUGH SPECIALIZED PERMITS AND ONLY SAY SOMEWHERE JUST MEANING WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT SCHOOL CRACKED NOT NECESSARILY SOME YOU KNOW YOU ABSOLUTE. IF YOU'RE A HARD MAN THIS WHEN I STUDENTS ARE NOT IN SESSION DURING THE SUMMER RIGHT ABSOLUTE OR WHATEVER MONTHS. WHAT IF THIS BILL IS ONLY APPLYING FOR THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN I STUDENTS ARE NOT IN SCHOOL SUDDENLY PLACE TO TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS CREEK -- NINETY AROUND FOR PUBLIC IT IS PUBLIC SCHOOLS. OKAY. BUT MY PUBLIC SCHOOLS DON'T HAVE SUMMER BUT IT YET THERE'S SOME -- IT A I THINK A RIGHT TO KNOW THAT IN THE LANGUAGE IT REFERENCES THIS SUMMER MONTHS ON AND SO WOULD APPLY TO THAT THE SCHOOLS THAT HAVE THAT -- YEAR ROUND TIME YEAR ROUND TRACKS SO THE AUTHOR IS OFFERING TO DO MORE WORK ON THIS SUBJECT THAT SATISFY YOUR CONCERN -- MEL DO MORE WORK TOGETHER HOUSE THAT SOMEONE ABSOLUTELY WOULD HAVE TO BE A CITIZEN TIMELINE I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY AND AM BUT SHE JUST IN TIME ON THIS ISSUE SO WHAT THE TO CLEAR FINE PIECES IS THAT -- SEVERAL MONTHS. BUT IN THE ISSUE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT EXCELLENT HOPE WITHOUT SATISFIES THE MEMBERS -- CONCERN AND LEAVE THAT THERE'S A MOTION. THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED ANY OTHER DISCUSSION. SEE NOW WOULD YOU LIKE CLOSE. WOULD RESPECT ASKING I DON'T THINK YOU FOR ALLOWING THE DISCUSSION THINK EVEN DISCUSSION TODAY SPORADIC YOU PASS RECOMMENDATION WE JUST CALL THE ROLL.

AZ OUR THIRTY FOUR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES. AND MARK DELIGHTED TO BE BEFORE YOU TO INTRODUCE AG OUR THIRTY FOUR LABOR SHORTAGES IN AGRICULTURE. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS YOU ALL KNOW THE INDUSTRY EMPLOYS MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND FARMWORKERS ACCORDING TO THE TWO DOWN SIXTEEN UC DAVIS. SAID HE WITH THE CALIFORNIA APPOINTMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. AT THE FOOD AND AG DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES TO CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE OUTPUT INCLUDES MORE THAN FOREIGNER COMMODITIES INCLUDING. OVER ONE THIRD OF THE COUNTRY'S VEGETABLES AND TWO THIRDS OF THE COUNTRY'S FOODS [inaudible] AND NOTS ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL ARE QUICK TO SURVEY OVER 6% OF FARMWORKERS ARE UNAUTHORIZED AND VARIOUS SOURCES ESTIMATE THAT THE NUMBER. OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS MAKE SEAT. TO CLOSE 275%. IF THOSE UNAUTHORISED WORKERS WERE TO BE DEPORTED -- AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS SOME PROGRESSIVE AS IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT DIE IN THESE PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES AS OF RECENT. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD BE A MAJOR A NATIONAL FOOD SHORTAGE SECURITY PROBLEM. BEFORE AS WELL I BELIEVE THAT STATE HAVE THE RIGHT TO ADDRESS THEIR OWN LABOR ISSUES THE US CONSTITUTION. MAKES IT EXPLICITLY CLEAR THAT IMMIGRATION ISSUES ARE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TODAY'S FARMWORKERS ARE AGING AND THEIR CHILDREN. I DO NOT WANT TO WORK IN THE FIELDS AND MEANWHILE THERE ARE FEWER IMMIGRANTS COMING TO THE COUNTRY TO REPLACE THEM. THIS RESOLUTION WOULD PUT THE ISSUE OF LABOR SHORTAGES ON THE RADAR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND WOULD URGE CONGRESS TO ALLOW STATES TO ADDRESS THEIR OWN LABOR ISSUES -- AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND YOU'RE A TEAM -- FOR ALLOWING US TO COME BEFORE YOU BRING THIS ISSUE FORWARD CONTINUE -- WHAT I STARTED OFF AS IT APART CONVERSATION SEVERAL MONTHS AGO REGARDING THE SUBJECTS OF -- WE HAVE ONE WITNESS AYE THAT WILL BE SPEAKING. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED MEMBERS I'M ARNOLD ATORES I'M REPRESENTING CLINIC AS INVITED SALINAS AND MONTEREY COUNTY. WHEN WE PREPARED A THIS EFFORT? IT WAS -- TO SUPPORT -- AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE WHICH YOU HEARD. TO TO VOTE ON THE REALITY IS THAT THE DISCUSSIONS IN CONGRESS TODAY ARE EITHER AROUND CHILDREN OR AROUND DHAKA. BOTH POPULATIONS DESERVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DISCUSSION AND RESOLUTION TO THE SPECIFIC. CIRCUMSTANCES THAT CONFRONT THEM BUT WHAT WE CONTINUE TO IGNORE THE PARENT GENERATION. WE TRY TO PUT THIS RESOLUTION IN THE CONTEXT OF AN ECONOMIC REALITY AND THAT IS THAT THE AMERICAN BORN WORKERS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ETHNICITY IN THE RACE. DO NOT WANT TO WORK IN THE FIELDS OF STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S REGARDLESS OF THE INCREASE IN WAGES -- THERE ARE A CLEAR -- CROPS THAT ARE INCREASING THEIR WAGES TO TRY TO ATTRACT AMERICAN BORN WORKERS. THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TAKING PLACE IN THE HEARING THAT YOU HAD ON EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE YOU HAD. A REPRESENTATIVE OF ONE OF THE ORGANIZATION'S OPPOSED TO THE BILL INDICATING THAT THERE WERE EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT OF ROLES OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE UNFORTUNATELY NOT OF THOSE EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND ARE INTERESTED IN COMING OUT TO WORK IN THE FIELDS. AND NOW THERE IS AN ARGUMENT THAT SAYS YOU COULD PAY FIFTY DOLLARS AN HOUR AND THEY WOULD COME OUT TO WORK. AVOCADOS PAY TWENTY DOLLARS AN HOUR -- GRAPES ARE PAYING UP TO SEVENTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR AND THESE ARE GOOD WAGES -- AND MANY OF THEM ARE NOW CARRYING -- SO I THINK IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS COMMITTEE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF INJECTING. A VERY IMPORTANT -- NARRATIVE THAT IS BEING LOST IN THE DEBATE IN CONGRESS AND THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PARENTS. THE PARENTS WHO ARE WORKING THE PARENTS WHO ARE MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS -- WHO IN MOST CASES IN THIS POPULATION OF FARM WORKERS HAVE BEEN HERE BETWEEN TEN AND SEVENTEEN YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN CALIFORNIA WORKING? SO UNFORTUNATELY THE ELEMENTS IN THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN CONGRESS FROM THE CALIFORNIA DELEGATION -- ARE TRUE IN WHAT THEY CAN IT APPEARS THAT FROM ALL MIT MEDIA COVERAGE BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THEY'RE EXCLUDING. A VERY VERY IMPORTANT ECONOMIC -- REALITY OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY WHICH IS AGRICULTURE AND THEY IN THE PROCESS ARE IGNORING THE POPULATION THAT MAKE THAT ECONOMY. OUR THAT ECONOMIC SECTOR CALIFORNIA AS EFFECTIVE AND IS PRODUCTIVE AND IMPORTANT AS IT IS SO. WE HOPE THAT -- YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS IN THAT -- GIVES US A CHANCE TO MOVE THIS TO CERTAIN MEMBERS IN THE LECTURE IN THE CONGRESS -- TO HAVE THEM UNDERSTAND THE CALIFORNIA IS LOOKING -- FOR A PARTNERSHIP -- OF SORTS TO WORK WITH THEIR DELEGATION IN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE TO TRY AND ADDRESS THIS ISSUE -- IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T CREATE A CRISES IN A WAY THAT AVOIDS WHAT WE SEE TAKING PLACE TODAY. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT I'VE SEEN NINE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION -- SAY NONE TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I SEEN NONE IS THERE A MOTION. SMOOVE THE SECOND IT IS HAS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION SERVICE LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO PRESENT A SIDE RESOLUTION.

THAT SOLUTION IS OUT THANK YOU THANK YOUR MATCH CONGRATULATIONS AYE BECAUSE SENATOR PAN PRESENT. SP. TWELVE FIFTY TWO SENATORS CHAIR MEMBERS PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU READY OKAY. SO I'M HERE TO PRESENT SP TWELVE FIFTY TO A SIMPLE BUT IMPORTANT BILL THINK THEY'RE AWESOME READY THESE BILLS -- CIVIL IMPORTANT ALTHOUGH I'M SURE THAT ALL WORKERS HAVE TO BELIEVE ACCESS THEIR PAYMENT INFORMATION AND RECORDS. SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES CALIFORNIA'S AFFORDED WORKERS THE IMPORTANT RIGHT FEEL INSPECTOR COPY PAYMENT RECORDS KEPT BY THE EMPLOYERS. HOWEVER IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT SOME OF PLAYERS IN THE AGRICULTURAL FIELD ARE SELECTIVELY READING THE CURRENT LAW THE FORCE EMPLOYEES. PROVIDER OWN MEANS OF COPYING RECORDS. THIS IS OF COURSE NOT ONLY A PRACTICAL AND REASONABLE BUT ALSO CONTRADICTS THE SPIRIT AND INTENT OF THE LAW. BUT MAKING A SLIGHT CHANGE EXISTING LAW THE GIVE WORKERS THE RIGHTS TO INSPECT OR RECEIVE A COPY OF PAYMENT RECORDS LET'S CIVIC AMBER. FOR PREVENTS SIMILAR HARMFUL ACTIONS FROM OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE THIS BILL SPUR US SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA REAL. RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION SUPPORT BY UNITED FARM WORKERS TO CALIFORNIA CLINT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION AND EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES -- SP TWELVE FIFTY TWOS NO FORMAL OPPOSITION AND DIVES LIKE WE ASK WHAT I'VE IT. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MARK CHOCOLATE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION AS SENATOR SENATE SPONSOR OF THE BILL THIS IS A NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT STATUTE. THAT WAS ENACTED BEFORE SMARTPHONES BEFORE SCANNERS BEFORE PORTABLE COPY MACHINES. THE YOU THE TERM OF ART AT THE TIME WAS. INSPECT OR COPY YOUR PAY STUBS VIRTUALLY EVERY EMPLOYER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INTERPRETS THAT LANGUAGE TO MEAN. PROVIDE THE WORKER A COPY OF THEIR PAY STUBS UPON THEIR REASONABLE REQUEST. FOR THIRTY YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN SOME EMPLOYERS MOSTLY EMPLOYERS WHO ARE ENGAGED IN WAGE THEFT WHO ARE TRYING TO STOP PROSECUTION OF THESE CASES BY IMPOSING BARRIERS TO THEIR TO TO THE RECEIPT OF WAGE STUB INFORMATION WHICH ARE VITAL TO WAGE THEFT CASES. AND THEY'RE THE REASON FOR THIS STATUTE MOST RECENTLY AS I'VE LEARNED THAT ONE OF OUR OFFICES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. HAD STOP CONTESTING EMPLOYER DENIALS OF THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE A COPY OF THEIR CLIENTS WAGE STUBS. AND WERE ED PURCHASED A SCANNER AND A LAPTOP FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF GOING TO THE EMPLOYERS OFFICE TO MAKE THE COPIES THEMSELVES. I'M AS THE SENATOR SAID THIS IT CONFLICTS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF THE ACT. AND IT'S ANACHRONISTIC LANGUAGE THAT CAN BE RECTIFIED BY SIMPLY CHANGING THIRD WORD. COPY TO RECEIVE A COPY AND THAT'S ALL THE BILL DOESN'T WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT [inaudible] THAT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT.

TWELVE TWENTY THREE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE WE KNOW YOU MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO PRESENT THIS TODAY. PROBLEMATIC SHARON MEMBERS BUSY DAY FOR YOU AS WELL I KNOW -- I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SP TWELVE TWENTY THREE WHICH WILL REQUIRE THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT TO DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE. FOR INDUSTRY SPECIFIC HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION PREVENTION POLICY. FOR USE BY EMPLOYERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. RECENT REVELATIONS UNDERSCORE THE EXTENT TO WHICH WIDESPREAD SEXUAL HARASSMENT EXIST WITHIN VIRTUALLY EVERY INDUSTRY. THESE INCIDENTS UNDERMINE THE ACHIEVEMENTS OUR STATE IS MADE TOWARDS GENDER EQUITY IN THE WORKPLACE. HIGHLY SKILLED AND TRAINED WOMEN OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY CONTRIBUTE GREATLY TO CALIFORNIA'S INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMY. HOWEVER DESPITE EFFORTS TO RECRUIT WOMEN IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WOMEN MAKE UP JUST 3% OF CALIFORNIA'S TOLD CONSTRUCTION WORK FORCE. AND ONLY TWO POINT 4% OF THE APPRENTICES AB ENROLLED IN THE M. PRETENTIOUS. SYSTEM. S. B. TWELVE TWENTY THREE ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM BY STOP WISHING ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO DEVELOP AN INDUSTRY SPECIFIC ANTI HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION POLICY IN TRAINING STANDARD. FOR USE BY CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYEE. EFFORTS TO PROMOTE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF BOTH FEMALE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS CAN ACTIVELY ALLEVIATE BOTH OF THESE PROBLEMS. I'LL BE TAKING CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS THE BILL SPONSORED BY THE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES. WERE HERE WITH ME TODAY TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK ME I'D VOTE. THANK YOU BILL HAS A MOTION AND A SECOND CHAIR SECONDS PLEASE PROCEED. SIR MR MY RECESS IDEAS ON BEHALF OF STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL -- WENT THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR VERY THOROUGH ANALYSIS THANK THE SENATOR FOR CARRYING THIS IMPORTANT BILL IT'S A COMPANION BILL WITH ANNA. ASSEMBLY BILL CARRIED BY ASSEMBLY WOMAN COUNTY YOU KNOW TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES AT THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION SITE WE'VE DONE A LOT OF GREAT WORK OF TRYING TO RECRUIT MORE PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY SPECIFICALLY TARGETING MORE WOMEN INTO OUR INDUSTRY. AYE SHE STATED THE NUMBERS ARE VERY DISMAL WE HAVE TRIED AND WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO HAVE THEM ACTUALLY GET INTO THE PRESSURE PROGRAM BUT ALSO STAY IN THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT HIGH DROP OUT RATE WITHIN THIS FOR SIX MONTHS. WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE SO THAT WHEN A WOMAN GOES INTO THE CONSTRUCTION SITE SHE SEES MORE FEMALES IN THE CONSTRUCTION AYE WORKING ALONGSIDE WITH HER WE BELIEVE THAT THESE TWO COMPANION BILLS WILL CHANGE THE CULTURE OF THE JOB SITE. AND WILL HOW FOURTEEN MORE WOMEN INTO THE CONSTRUCTION AND THE STREETS ARE IMPORTANT FOR THOSE REASONS WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE -- IS JESSICA STENDER SENIOR COUNSEL FOR WORKPLACE JUSTICE AND PUBLIC POLICY EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES OUT WE REGULARLY WORK WITH WOMEN IN THE TRADES WE KNOW THAT -- THE VAST MAJORITY OF MINIMUM WAGE AND LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE WOMEN -- AND THE COMPARISON BETWEEN WHAT YOU MAKE IT A MINIMUM WAGE JOB AND A JOB LIKE THE TRADES A SUBSTANTIAL AN AVERAGE JOURNEY WORKER CAN EARN ABOUT THIRTY DOLLARS AN HOUR IN SPECIALIZED ROLLS UP. TO SIXTY SO THAT DIFFERENCE OF COURSE MAKES IT MEANS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAKING A REAL LIVING FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY. ONE OF THE BIGGEST OBSTACLES WE'VE SEEN WOMEN FACE I'VE HEARD THERE'S VERY SEVERELY UNDER REPRESENTED ABOUT 3% BOTH NATIONALLY AND IN CALIFORNIA AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS THAT WE SEE TWO WOMEN STAYING IN THESE JOBS. IS THE HARASSMENT THAT THEY FREQUENTLY FACE THERE OFTEN THE ONLY WOMAN OR ONE OF A FEW WOMEN ON THIS JOB SITE. ALMONDS OF HAVING THIS KIND OF TRAINING THAT'S NOT ONLY TRAINING BUT THE INDUSTRY SPECIFIC TRAINING IS REALLY CRITICAL SO THAT PEOPLE GET AT THE REAL ROOT CAUSES OF HARASSMENT AND WHAT CAN BE DONE IN THE SPECIFIC JOB SITES TO ADDRESS IT.
