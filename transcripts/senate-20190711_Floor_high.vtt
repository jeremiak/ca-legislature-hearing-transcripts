PRESIDENT.

00:38:58.903 --> 00:39:00.171
THE DAY WOULD REQUIRE TAX

01:12:20.436 --> 01:12:21.704
SIGNIFICANT GROWTH.

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:23.872
OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES

01:12:23.939 --> 01:12:24.173
[inaudible]

01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:26.108
IN PROVIDING.

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:29.011
LIFE SAVING MEDICATIONS.

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:30.946
THAT DO NOT EXIST.

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:33.348
AW IN THE UNITED STATES IN

01:12:33.415 --> 01:12:34.583
OFFERED BY COMMERCIAL

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:37.820
PHARMACEUTICALS.

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:39.555
EVERY DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF

01:12:39.621 --> 01:12:40.689
CALIFORNIA HAS A COMPOUNDING

01:12:40.756 --> 01:12:43.058
PHARMACY.

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:43.992
AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE

01:12:44.059 --> 01:12:46.762
SOMETIMES EVENTS THAT HAPPEN AND

01:12:46.829 --> 01:12:48.564
IN OUR COUNTRY WHERE.

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.399
GOVERNMENT SOMETIMES HAS A KNEE

01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:52.801
JERK REACTION AND WANTS.

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:54.303
TO REGULATE TO PREVENT.

01:12:54.369 --> 01:12:58.006
RECURRENCES OF OF ISSUES.

01:12:58.073 --> 01:12:59.508
THERE WAS A PHARMACY ON THE EAST

01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:01.310
COAST CALLED NEW ENGLAND

01:13:01.376 --> 01:13:04.379
COMPOUNDING PHARMACY -- MORE

01:13:04.446 --> 01:13:06.882
ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AGO.

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:08.751
THAT WAS NOT FOLLOWING THE STATE

01:13:08.817 --> 01:13:10.919
BOARD OF PHARMACY ON THE EAST

01:13:10.986 --> 01:13:12.287
COAST IN MASSACHUSETTS.

01:13:12.354 --> 01:13:15.791
THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:13:15.858 --> 01:13:18.093
REGULATING COMPOUNDING PHARMACY.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.528
THEY TOOK THEIR EYE OFF THE BALL

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:21.730
AND ALLOW THE COMPANY TO BECOME

01:13:21.797 --> 01:13:24.399
MORE OF A CLAUSE I MANUFACTURER.

01:13:24.466 --> 01:13:26.001
HAVING A SALES TEAM TRYING TO

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:27.803
SELL THEIR INJECTABLE DRUGS

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:29.471
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

01:13:29.538 --> 01:13:31.440
AND THEY WERE NOT OPERATING AS A

01:13:31.507 --> 01:13:34.977
TRUE COMPOUNDING PHARMACY.

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:36.044
THE SAD END OF THAT STORY IS

01:13:36.111 --> 01:13:38.480
THAT.

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:41.150
MORE THAN FIFTY PEOPLE DIED.

01:13:41.216 --> 01:13:42.851
FROM AN INCIDENT.

01:13:42.918 --> 01:13:44.319
FROM A BAD BATCH OF AN

01:13:44.386 --> 01:13:45.754
INJECTABLE.

01:13:45.821 --> 01:13:47.489
THE CAUSE OF FUNGAL MENINGITIS

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:50.392
PROBLEM IN LEFT OVER THREE OR

01:13:50.459 --> 01:13:51.026
FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE PERMANENTLY

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:53.662
DISABLED.

01:13:53.729 --> 01:13:55.898
THIS IS A HORRIBLE INCIDENT.

01:13:55.964 --> 01:13:58.367
AND I HAVE TO SAY SENSE THEM.

01:13:58.433 --> 01:13:59.935
STATE BOARDS OF PHARMACY ACROSS

01:14:00.002 --> 01:14:02.004
THE COUNTRY [inaudible]

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:03.772
HAVING GAUGED.

01:14:03.839 --> 01:14:06.875
LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT WE DO.

01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:07.876
AND HAVE ENACTED GREAT

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:09.745
REGULATIONS.

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:12.014
AND I WANT TO PAY TRIBUTE. TO

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.316
OUR STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY.

01:14:14.383 --> 01:14:15.517
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN VERY

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:17.653
PROACTIVE.

01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:20.255
AND HAVE PUT FORWARD FORWARD

01:14:20.322 --> 01:14:24.726
GREAT GOOD REGULATIONS.

01:14:24.793 --> 01:14:27.296
THAT HAVE CLOSED DOWN.

01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:28.263
PHARMACISTS THAT HAVE GOTTEN

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:29.631
INTO COMPOUNDING THAT REALLY

01:14:29.698 --> 01:14:33.001
DIDN'T HAVE THE EDUCATION. TO

01:14:33.068 --> 01:14:35.070
SAFELY DISPENSE AND COMPOUND

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:37.506
MEDICATIONS.

01:14:37.573 --> 01:14:40.809
MY FEAR WITH THIS BILL THOUGH IS.

01:14:40.876 --> 01:14:42.044
THAT THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:44.746
CAN GO BEYOND.

01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:46.882
THE USP STANDARDS.

01:14:46.949 --> 01:14:48.917
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT WITH THE

01:14:48.984 --> 01:14:51.119
REGULATIONS THAT EXISTS TODAY.

01:14:51.186 --> 01:14:53.188
THE COUNT HOW MANY PHARMACIES

01:14:53.255 --> 01:14:55.591
ARE ON THE BRINK.

01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:57.025
OF NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:14:57.092 --> 01:14:58.961
LIFESAVING [inaudible]

01:14:59.027 --> 01:15:01.230

01:15:01.296 --> 01:15:03.665
THE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES.

01:15:03.732 --> 01:15:05.667
IN VARIOUS DISCIPLINES I'LL GIVE

01:15:05.734 --> 01:15:10.005
YOU ONE DISCIPLINE AS AN EXAMPLE.

01:15:10.072 --> 01:15:11.473
MY COMPOUNDING PHARMACY

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:12.674
SPECIALIZES.

01:15:12.741 --> 01:15:15.544
IN PAIN CONTROL.

01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:17.546
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE.

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:18.881
THAT HAVE SUCH EXTENSIVE PAIN

01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:20.949
PROBLEMS [inaudible]

01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:23.185
THAT.

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:24.920
THE ONLY MEDICATIONS THAT CAN

01:15:24.987 --> 01:15:26.755
HELP THEM.

01:15:26.822 --> 01:15:30.025
OUR YES NARCOTIC OPIATES.

01:15:30.092 --> 01:15:31.960
ANTI SPASMODIC.

01:15:32.027 --> 01:15:33.528
LOCAL ANESTHETICS.

01:15:33.595 --> 01:15:34.663
IN SOME CASES GENERAL

01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:36.265
ANESTHETICS.

01:15:36.331 --> 01:15:38.834
THAT ARE DELIVERED INTO A PUMP.

01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:39.968
THAT IS SURGICALLY IMPLANTED IN

01:15:40.035 --> 01:15:41.703
THE BODY.

01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:42.938
AND THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU GET

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:45.674

01:15:45.741 --> 01:15:47.175
YES SIR A PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE.

01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:48.243
BUT THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:50.212
GET THESE MEDICATIONS AND OFTEN

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:53.582
TIMES ARE MORE CONCENTRATED.

01:15:53.649 --> 01:15:56.551
THEN EXIST ON THE THE THE

01:15:56.618 --> 01:15:58.020
COMMERCIAL MARKET IS THROUGH A

01:15:58.086 --> 01:15:59.488
COMPOUNDING PHARMACY THAT HIS

01:15:59.554 --> 01:16:00.923
LICENSES ACCOUNT POUNDING

01:16:00.989 --> 01:16:02.524
PHARMACY.

01:16:02.591 --> 01:16:03.725
AND THEN THEY GET A STERILE

01:16:03.792 --> 01:16:05.460
COMPOUNDING LYSONS.

01:16:05.527 --> 01:16:06.695

01:16:06.762 --> 01:16:08.196
OTHER PHARMACY THAT IS

TRADITIONAL GET INSPECTED EVERY

01:16:09.932 --> 01:16:12.501
YEAR. TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE

01:16:12.567 --> 01:16:13.769
COMPLYING WITH THESE VERY

01:16:13.835 --> 01:16:19.942
STRENUOUS AND NECESSARY SANDERS.

01:16:20.008 --> 01:16:22.377
IF WE MAKE THESE REGULATIONS

01:16:22.444 --> 01:16:22.678
[inaudible]

01:16:22.744 --> 01:16:24.212
TOUGHER.

01:16:24.279 --> 01:16:26.548
IF WE OVER REGULATE.

01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:27.849
WE ARE GOING TO CREATE AN ACCESS

01:16:27.916 --> 01:16:30.485
PROBLEM. FOR THE THOUSANDS OF

01:16:30.552 --> 01:16:31.253
PEOPLE.

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.155
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:16:33.221 --> 01:16:34.356
THAT ACTUALLY LIVE A QUALITY OF

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:36.224
LIFE.

01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:36.992
THAT OTHERWISE WOULD BE

01:16:37.059 --> 01:16:40.395
RELEGATED. TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM.

01:16:40.462 --> 01:16:41.763
BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GET THE

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:42.597
MEDICATIONS ON THE

01:16:42.664 --> 01:16:44.933
CONCENTRATIONS THAT ARE DESIGNED

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:45.968
TO GO IN THERE PUMPED.

01:16:46.034 --> 01:16:47.269
THAT IS THE LIVER TO THEIR

01:16:47.336 --> 01:16:50.072
CEREBROSPINAL FLUID THAT HAVE TO

01:16:50.138 --> 01:16:52.240
BE MADE WITH NO PRESERVATIVES.

01:16:52.307 --> 01:16:54.609
BECAUSE IT'S PRESERVATIVES CAUSE

01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:56.778
TREMENDOUS DAMAGE. TO NERVES AND

01:16:56.845 --> 01:16:58.013
WE KNOW THAT OUR SPINAL COLUMN

01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.214
IS JUST LOADED WITH NERVE

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:00.882
NETWORKS.

01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:02.551
SO AGAIN I I STAND IN AND

STANDARDS IN UNDERSTANDING THE

01:17:12.194 --> 01:17:14.763
RAMIFICATIONS TO ACCESS.

01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:16.465
BECAUSE WE ARE AT THAT FINE LINE

01:17:16.531 --> 01:17:18.867
NOW WERE ANY FURTHER REGULATIONS

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:20.035

01:17:20.102 --> 01:17:21.703
COULD ACTUALLY SHOT.

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:23.605
EVERY COMPOUNDING PHARMACY TO

THIS LEGISLATION BUT WE SHOULD

01:17:45.694 --> 01:17:46.294
ENCOURAGE A STATE BOARD OF
