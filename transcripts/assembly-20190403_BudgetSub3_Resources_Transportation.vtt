00:26:33.558 --> 00:26:34.526
GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE

CONDITION OF THE G. G. R. OUT.

00:26:37.028 --> 00:26:38.296
SOME COMMENTS AROUND KIND OF

00:26:38.363 --> 00:26:39.331
WHAT THE REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS ARE

00:26:39.397 --> 00:26:41.032
AND WHAT OUR ESTIMATES ARE AND

00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:41.466
HOW THEY COMPARE THE

00:26:41.533 --> 00:26:42.467
MINISTRATIONS.

00:26:42.534 --> 00:26:43.435
WHAT THAT MEANS FOR KIND OF

00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:45.270
OVERALL RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR

00:26:45.337 --> 00:26:47.706

MAYBE CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE

00:26:57.849 --> 00:26:59.584
TABLE ON PAGE FOURTEEN OF YOUR

00:26:59.651 --> 00:27:01.453
AGENDA.

00:27:01.519 --> 00:27:05.623
WHICH GIVES A KIND OF SUMMARY OF

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.726
THE REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES

00:27:07.792 --> 00:27:09.828
AND FUNDBALANCE -- UNDER THE

00:27:09.894 --> 00:27:11.830
GOVERNOR'S ASSUMPTIONS AROUND

00:27:11.896 --> 00:27:13.098
REVENUE AND THEN SOME OF OUR

00:27:13.164 --> 00:27:14.332
ESTIMATES AROUND WHAT REVENUE

00:27:14.399 --> 00:27:16.968
WILL BE -- JUST TO GO OVER SOME

00:27:17.035 --> 00:27:18.336
OF THE HIGH LEVEL MEMBERS OF THE

00:27:18.403 --> 00:27:19.938
ADMINISTRATION ASSUMES TWO POINT

00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:21.840
SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE

00:27:21.906 --> 00:27:23.074
IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:24.642
AND TWO POINT ONE BILLION AND

00:27:24.709 --> 00:27:27.012
THE BUDGET YEAR -- THERE ARE

00:27:27.078 --> 00:27:28.513
PROPOSING FOR THE BUDGET YEAR A

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:29.848
TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

00:27:29.914 --> 00:27:32.484
SPENDING PLAN THAT INCLUDES -- A

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:33.585
LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED MILLION

00:27:33.651 --> 00:27:34.886
AND KIND OF EXPENDITURES THAT

00:27:34.953 --> 00:27:36.821
COME OFF THE TOP TO CERTAIN --

00:27:36.888 --> 00:27:37.455
COMMITMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE

00:27:37.522 --> 00:27:39.424
IN THE PAST AS WELL AS ABOUT ONE

00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:40.925
POINT TWO BILLION IN CONTINUOUS

00:27:40.992 --> 00:27:42.160
APPROPRIATIONS BASED ON THE

00:27:42.227 --> 00:27:43.495
REVENUE ESTIMATES.

00:27:43.561 --> 00:27:45.897
AND OVER ONE BILLION IN

00:27:45.964 --> 00:27:47.032
DISCRETIONARY SPENDING ALL GOOD

00:27:47.098 --> 00:27:49.300
AND TO THAT PROPOSAL IN MORE

00:27:49.367 --> 00:27:51.803
DETAIL IN JUST A MINUTE -- AND

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:52.771
UNDER THOSE REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS

00:27:52.837 --> 00:27:55.106
THAT WOULD WOULD BE LESS THAN

00:27:55.173 --> 00:27:55.740
ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FUND

00:27:55.807 --> 00:27:58.910
BALANCE -- WE'RE PROJECTING THAT

00:27:58.977 --> 00:28:00.211
REVENUE OVER THE CURRENT YEAR IN

00:28:00.278 --> 00:28:02.013
THE BUDGET YEAR WOULD BE ABOUT

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:02.614
EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.181
MORE THAN WHAT THE

00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:06.084
ADMINISTRATION IS ASSUMING IN

00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:10.055
THEIR PROPOSAL -- ONCE YOU KIND

00:28:10.121 --> 00:28:11.556
OF TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE

00:28:11.623 --> 00:28:12.824
CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS THAT

00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:14.726
AUTOMATICALLY GET ALLOCATED TO

00:28:14.793 --> 00:28:16.795
VARIOUS PROGRAMS -- WE'RE

00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:18.396
PROJECTING THAT UNDER THOSE READ

00:28:18.463 --> 00:28:19.798
OUR REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS -- THERE

00:28:19.864 --> 00:28:21.800
WOULD BE ABOUT A FOUR HUNDRED

00:28:21.866 --> 00:28:22.333
FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FUND

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.101
BALANCE.

00:28:23.168 --> 00:28:24.135
AND SO THERE'S STILL QUITE A BIT

00:28:24.202 --> 00:28:25.870
OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND REVENUE

00:28:25.937 --> 00:28:26.905
BUT WE DO THINK THAT THERE WILL

00:28:26.971 --> 00:28:28.139
BE MORE RACES OF RESOURCES

00:28:28.206 --> 00:28:29.841
AVAILABLE AND WHAT THE

00:28:29.908 --> 00:28:31.476
ADMINISTRATION IS ASSUMING -- WE

00:28:31.543 --> 00:28:32.577
STILL THINK IT'S DEFINITELY

00:28:32.644 --> 00:28:34.079
PRUDENT TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY

00:28:34.145 --> 00:28:35.713
FUND BALANCE BUT UNDER OUR

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:36.981
PROJECTIONS WE DO THINK IT WOULD

00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:38.550
BE -- IT COULD BE REASONABLE TO

00:28:38.616 --> 00:28:39.951
ALLOCATE SOME ADDITIONAL MONEY

00:28:40.018 --> 00:28:41.352
SO FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE

00:28:41.419 --> 00:28:43.321
ALLOCATED A COUPLE HUNDRED

00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:44.089
MILLION DOLLARS MORE.

00:28:44.155 --> 00:28:46.091
IT WOULD STILL BE OVER TWO

00:28:46.157 --> 00:28:47.158
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR BALANCE

00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:47.792
IN THE FUND IN WHICH WE THINK

00:28:47.859 --> 00:28:49.394
THAT'S A THAT'S A REASONABLE

00:28:49.461 --> 00:28:50.495
PLACE TO BE.

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:51.863
SO IF I COULD INTERJECT A

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:53.898
QUESTION EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION

00:28:53.965 --> 00:28:55.200
IS FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT.

00:28:55.266 --> 00:28:55.733
IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.403
ASSUMPTIONS -- THAT THE LA YOU

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.738
LA ALWAYS USING OVER PART IN THE

00:29:00.805 --> 00:29:02.140
FINANCE OR IS IT JUST AN

00:29:02.207 --> 00:29:03.641
EXPECTATION.

00:29:03.708 --> 00:29:04.509
YEAH SO WHAT WE SETTLED SOME

00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:05.810
BACK AND FORTH WITH THE

00:29:05.877 --> 00:29:07.345
ADMINISTRATION ON THAT I I THINK

00:29:07.412 --> 00:29:08.880
THE KEY DIFFERENCES IN

00:29:08.947 --> 00:29:10.482
ASSUMPTIONS ARE ROUNDS.

00:29:10.548 --> 00:29:11.216
ASSUMPTIONS AROUND HOW MANY

00:29:11.282 --> 00:29:13.118
ALLOWANCES WILL BE OFFERED AND

00:29:13.184 --> 00:29:15.286
SOLD.

00:29:15.353 --> 00:29:16.488
OVER THE NEXT YEAR PLUS.

00:29:16.554 --> 00:29:17.755
I THINK WE BOTH ASSUME THAT

00:29:17.822 --> 00:29:19.958
ALLOWANCE PRICES WILL STAY AT OR

00:29:20.024 --> 00:29:21.960
CLOSE TO THE FLOOR AS THEY HAVE

00:29:22.026 --> 00:29:23.761
BEEN IN RECENT YEARS -- WE JUST

00:29:23.828 --> 00:29:24.929
HAVE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT

00:29:24.996 --> 00:29:26.931
HOW MANY ALLOWANCES OR ARE BEING

00:29:26.998 --> 00:29:29.868
OFFERED -- WE WE ASSUME THAT YOU

00:29:29.934 --> 00:29:31.002
ALL OF THE ALLOWANCES SO IT

00:29:31.069 --> 00:29:31.970
CLOSE TO THE FOR PRICE WHICH HAS

00:29:32.036 --> 00:29:34.105
BEEN CONSISTENT -- ALMOST ALL

00:29:34.172 --> 00:29:34.973
THE ALLOWANCES SO CLOSE TO THE

00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:35.907
FOR PLACE WHICH HAS BEEN

00:29:35.974 --> 00:29:41.846
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE HAD IN

00:29:41.913 --> 00:29:42.280
THE IN THE LAST YEAR

00:29:42.347 --> 00:29:42.580
[inaudible]

00:29:42.647 --> 00:29:45.250
TO THANK -- THE SECOND POINT.

00:29:45.316 --> 00:29:45.917
I WANT TO NOTICE JUST LOOKING AT

00:29:45.984 --> 00:29:46.951
KIND OF A MULTI YEAR OUTLOOK --

00:29:47.018 --> 00:29:48.052
WE DO THINK AGAIN UNDER KIND OF

00:29:48.119 --> 00:29:49.287
THOSE SIMILAR TYPES OF

00:29:49.354 --> 00:29:50.955
CONDITIONS OF ALLOWANCE PRICES

00:29:51.022 --> 00:29:53.324
UP THE FLOOR AND ALL OF ALMOST

00:29:53.391 --> 00:29:54.659
ALL THE ALLOWANCES SELLING.

00:29:54.726 --> 00:29:55.827
REVENUE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE

00:29:55.894 --> 00:29:58.496
YEARS WOULD BE CLOSE TO TWO

00:29:58.563 --> 00:30:00.298
POINT FOUR BILLION AND SO --

00:30:00.365 --> 00:30:02.367
WHEN YOU LOOK AT AGAIN KIND OF

00:30:02.433 --> 00:30:04.569
ALLOCATING THIS 60% A CONTINUOUS

00:30:04.636 --> 00:30:05.503
APPROPRIATIONS AND SOME OF THE

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.005
OTHER EXPENDITURES THAT WOULD

00:30:07.071 --> 00:30:08.439
LEAVE ABOUT NINE HUNDRED MILLION

00:30:08.506 --> 00:30:09.440
DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE

00:30:09.507 --> 00:30:11.009
YEARS FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING

00:30:11.075 --> 00:30:12.110
SO WE THINK?

00:30:12.177 --> 00:30:12.911
YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP

00:30:12.977 --> 00:30:13.811
IN MIND WHEN THINKING ABOUT

00:30:13.878 --> 00:30:15.747
MAKING ONGOING AND MULTI YEAR

00:30:15.813 --> 00:30:17.315
COMMITMENTS THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT

00:30:17.382 --> 00:30:18.249
NINE HUNDRED MILLION.

00:30:18.316 --> 00:30:19.350
UNDER THAT SCENARIO WOULD BE

00:30:19.417 --> 00:30:20.451
AVAILABLE FOR THOSE TYPES OF

00:30:20.518 --> 00:30:22.954
THINGS AND FEET AND THE NEXT

00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:24.556
COUPLE OF YEARS -- AND THEN

00:30:24.622 --> 00:30:25.690
LASTLY A MORE OF A TECHNICAL

00:30:25.757 --> 00:30:27.158
ISSUE THERE IS SOME BUDGET BILL

00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:28.293
LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

00:30:28.359 --> 00:30:29.727
REVENUE UNCERTAINTY THE

00:30:29.794 --> 00:30:30.395
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD HAVE

00:30:30.461 --> 00:30:31.196
SOME.

00:30:31.262 --> 00:30:32.997
AUTHORITY TO REDUCE ALLOCATIONS

00:30:33.064 --> 00:30:35.466
TO CERTAIN PROGRAMS -- IF

00:30:35.533 --> 00:30:36.034
REVENUE COMES IN LOWER THAN

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.635
EXPECTED -- WE THINK THAT

00:30:37.702 --> 00:30:39.470
GENERAL PROVISIONS REASONABLE WE

00:30:39.537 --> 00:30:40.104
JUST WANNA KINDA HIGHLIGHT MAKE

00:30:40.171 --> 00:30:41.739
SURE THAT.

00:30:41.806 --> 00:30:42.407
YOU KNOW THE AUTHORITY THEY HAVE

00:30:42.473 --> 00:30:43.942
TO REDUCE -- CERTAIN PROGRAMS IS

00:30:44.008 --> 00:30:45.343
CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:46.477
LEGISLATURE'S PRIOR HOW IT LOOKS

00:30:46.544 --> 00:30:48.746
LIKE -- PRIORITIZES DIFFERENT

00:30:48.813 --> 00:30:49.948
PROGRAMS.

00:30:50.014 --> 00:30:52.951
I'M NOT A NEXT OLD JUMP INTO

00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:54.152
SOME OF THE DETAILS OF THE

00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:58.156
SPENDING PLAN ITSELF SO ON PAGE

00:30:58.223 --> 00:31:00.124
FIFTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA.

00:31:00.191 --> 00:31:02.193
IT HAS A LIST OF THE

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.128
EXPENDITURES THAT WOULD BE UNDER

00:31:04.195 --> 00:31:06.364
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL.

00:31:06.431 --> 00:31:08.166
I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH ALL

00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:11.636
OF THEM -- AT A HIGH LEVEL.

00:31:11.703 --> 00:31:12.971
A LOT OF THE EXPENDITURES ARE

00:31:13.037 --> 00:31:14.305
FOR PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:31:14.372 --> 00:31:16.507
RECEIVED FUNDING IN THE PAST I

00:31:16.574 --> 00:31:17.775
THINK ONE KEY EXCEPTION AS

00:31:17.842 --> 00:31:19.944
THERE'S A NEW WORKFORCE

00:31:20.011 --> 00:31:21.312
DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL THAT'S AND

00:31:21.379 --> 00:31:22.614
UNDER OTHER DISCRETIONARY

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.616
SPENDING TWENTY SEVEN MILLION

00:31:24.682 --> 00:31:26.584
DOLLARS -- YOUR AGENDA SINCE THE

00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:27.518
NOTE THAT THAT THAT PROPOSAL TO

00:31:27.585 --> 00:31:28.519
BE HEARD IN A DIFFERENT

00:31:28.586 --> 00:31:30.488
SUBCOMMITTEE SO I WON'T TALK

00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:32.757
ABOUT THAT IN IN DETAIL -- I DO

00:31:32.824 --> 00:31:35.226
WANNA HIGHLIGHT FOR THE SECOND

00:31:35.293 --> 00:31:36.527
TWO CATEGORIES ON THE ON THE

00:31:36.594 --> 00:31:38.563
TABLE THE DISCRETIONARY SPENDING

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.431
WE'VE GOT A BROKEN IT UP INTO.

00:31:40.498 --> 00:31:41.766
TWO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES ONE IS

00:31:41.833 --> 00:31:43.935
EXISTING DISCRETIONARY SPENDING

00:31:44.002 --> 00:31:45.103
SO.

00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:46.337
THOSE ARE PROGRAMS FOR THE

00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:48.206
LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY TAKEN AN

00:31:48.273 --> 00:31:49.941
ACTION OR GIVEN SOME INDICATION

00:31:50.008 --> 00:31:51.309
THAT WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE

00:31:51.376 --> 00:31:51.876
FUNDING FOR THESE TYPES OF

00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:52.810
PROGRAMS IN.

00:31:52.877 --> 00:31:54.646
PREVIOUS YEARS SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:31:54.712 --> 00:31:56.547
THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR

00:31:56.614 --> 00:31:58.049
FOREST RELATED ACTIVITIES AND SB

00:31:58.116 --> 00:31:59.751
NINE A ONE THAT WAS PASSED LAST

00:31:59.817 --> 00:32:02.587
YEAR -- SOME -- MULTI YOUR

00:32:02.654 --> 00:32:04.022
COMMITMENT FOR THE CLEAN VEHICLE

00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:04.622
REBATE PROJECT THOSE TYPES OF

00:32:04.689 --> 00:32:05.556
THINGS.

00:32:05.623 --> 00:32:07.859
AND THEN THE SECOND CATEGORY THE

00:32:07.925 --> 00:32:08.660
OTHER DISCRETIONARY SPENDING

00:32:08.726 --> 00:32:11.195
WHICH IS -- IN THE BUDGET YEAR

00:32:11.262 --> 00:32:11.729
FIVE HUNDRED NINETY THREE

00:32:11.796 --> 00:32:13.564
MILLION THOSE ARE -- KIND OF

00:32:13.631 --> 00:32:14.966
MORE WANT NEW KIND OF ONE TIME

00:32:15.033 --> 00:32:16.100
EXPENDITURES A LOT OF THEM ARE

00:32:16.167 --> 00:32:17.602
CONTINUING EXPENDITURES FOR

00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:18.803
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:19.604
IN THE PAST BUT THE LEGISLATURE

00:32:19.671 --> 00:32:20.605
HASN'T.

00:32:20.672 --> 00:32:21.472
GIVEN KIND OF A MULTI YEAR

00:32:21.539 --> 00:32:23.775
COMMITMENT FOR THOSE TYPES OF

00:32:23.841 --> 00:32:25.276
EXPENDITURES.

00:32:25.343 --> 00:32:26.911
SO -- JUST A COUPLE OF COMMENTS

00:32:26.978 --> 00:32:29.213
ON THE PROPOSAL AS A WHOLE --

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.715
MANY OF THE FUNDING PROPOSALS

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:32.216
DON'T HAVE.

00:32:32.283 --> 00:32:33.551
A LOT OF INFORMATION ON KIND OF

00:32:33.618 --> 00:32:35.420
WHAT THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES ARE

00:32:35.486 --> 00:32:36.954
FOR THOSE EXPENDITURE PROPOSALS

00:32:37.021 --> 00:32:38.423
SOME CASES JUST BASIC

00:32:38.489 --> 00:32:38.990
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MANY

00:32:39.057 --> 00:32:41.292
PROJECTS -- THE ADMINISTRATION

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:43.594
EXPECTS TO FUND -- AND AND A LOT

00:32:43.661 --> 00:32:45.196
OF CASES ESTIMATES AROUND WHAT

00:32:45.263 --> 00:32:46.464
THE EXPECTED EMISSION REDUCTIONS

00:32:46.531 --> 00:32:47.832
ARE SO SEE WHAT THOSE PROGRAMS

00:32:47.899 --> 00:32:49.267
AND SO WE ENCOURAGE AND

00:32:49.334 --> 00:32:50.635
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:51.769
DIRECTING MINISTRATION TO REPORT

00:32:51.836 --> 00:32:54.038
ON WHAT X. EXPECTS. FOR THOSE

00:32:54.105 --> 00:32:55.640
PROGRAMS BOTH TO GET A SENSE OF

00:32:55.707 --> 00:32:57.041
HOW TO PRIORITIZE YOUR FUNDING

00:32:57.108 --> 00:32:58.876
DECISIONS AS WELL AS A WHOLE THE

00:32:58.943 --> 00:32:59.911
ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE IN

00:32:59.977 --> 00:33:01.713
FUTURE YEARS FOR WHAT -- WHAT

00:33:01.779 --> 00:33:04.382
ACTUALLY?

00:33:04.449 --> 00:33:04.882
HAPPENS IN SOME OF THESE

00:33:04.949 --> 00:33:10.621
PROGRAMS -- THE SECOND POINT IS --

00:33:10.688 --> 00:33:11.989
FOR SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THERE

00:33:12.056 --> 00:33:14.859
WILL LIKELY BE NEED TO BE SOME

00:33:14.926 --> 00:33:16.527
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROGRAMS

00:33:16.594 --> 00:33:18.129
UNDER THE PROPOSED FUNDING

00:33:18.196 --> 00:33:20.298
AMOUNT SO FOR EXAMPLE -- CARBS

00:33:20.365 --> 00:33:22.967
CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT OF

00:33:23.034 --> 00:33:24.702
THE BUDGET INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED

00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:26.270
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT PROGRAM

00:33:26.337 --> 00:33:28.506
WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH AN

00:33:28.573 --> 00:33:29.140
ACTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS

00:33:29.207 --> 00:33:30.942
TAKEN -- FOR THAT PROGRAM --

00:33:31.008 --> 00:33:32.410
THERE HAD BEEN SOME RECENT

00:33:32.477 --> 00:33:33.911
PROJECTIONS AND WHAT THE DEMAND

00:33:33.978 --> 00:33:35.513
FOR THAT PROGRAM WILL BE AND IT

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:36.347
HAS SEEN IT.

00:33:36.414 --> 00:33:37.415
I THINK CARP RIGHT NOW IS

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:38.349
PROJECTED THAT IT WILL FAR

00:33:38.416 --> 00:33:40.017
EXCEED THE TO ON DEMAND UNDER

00:33:40.084 --> 00:33:41.018
KIND OF THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF

00:33:41.085 --> 00:33:42.920
THE PROGRAM WILL FAR EXCEED THE

00:33:42.987 --> 00:33:43.688
TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND

00:33:43.755 --> 00:33:46.190
SO -- CAN YOU GIVE US AN IDEA

00:33:46.257 --> 00:33:48.259
WHAT THAT MEANS YES SO SO -- I

00:33:48.326 --> 00:33:49.794
BELIEVE UNDER THEIR CURRENT

00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:51.896
PROJECTIONS -- IN THE BUDGET

00:33:51.963 --> 00:33:53.765
YEAR UNDER THE PROGRAM AS IT

00:33:53.831 --> 00:33:55.099
CURRENTLY STANDS THERE WERE --

00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:57.368
DEMAND WOULD BE ROUGHLY FOUR

00:33:57.435 --> 00:33:59.036
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:33:59.103 --> 00:34:03.674
SOVIET DOUBLE WHAT THE PROPOSED

00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:06.210
AMOUNT IS AND SO THAT MEANS --

00:34:06.277 --> 00:34:07.078
YET AND THERE WOULDN'T IN ORDER

00:34:07.145 --> 00:34:07.645
TO STAY WITHIN A BUDGET THEY

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:08.246
WERE LIKE WE NEED TO BE SOME

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:08.813
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.881
STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM WHETHER

00:34:09.947 --> 00:34:11.382
THAT BE -- YOU KNOW WHICH

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:13.785
VEHICLES QUALIFY FOR REBATES THE

00:34:13.851 --> 00:34:15.953
AMOUNT OF THE REBATES -- INCOME

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.622
LIMITS THOSE TYPES OF THINGS AND

00:34:17.688 --> 00:34:20.191
SO -- WE RECOMMEND YOU MIGHT

00:34:20.258 --> 00:34:22.026
WANT TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION

00:34:22.093 --> 00:34:22.994
TO KIND OF REPORT ON WHAT

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.096
THEY'RE THINKING IS AROUND KIND

00:34:25.163 --> 00:34:25.663
OF WHAT THOSE TO TRUST THE

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:26.497
JUDGMENTS ARE.

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:27.732
AND WHETHER THOSE TYPES

00:34:27.799 --> 00:34:29.267
ADJUSTMENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH

00:34:29.333 --> 00:34:32.303
WITH WHAT YOUR PRIORITIES ARE

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:32.937
ABOUT THIS THE STRUCTURE OF THE

00:34:33.004 --> 00:34:35.106
PROGRAM -- AND THEN FINALLY JUST.

00:34:35.173 --> 00:34:38.075
MORE GENERALLY AS ALWAYS -- I

00:34:38.142 --> 00:34:39.243
THINK YOU KNOW THE G. JARA

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:40.945
PACKAGE AS A MATTER OF HOW THE

00:34:41.012 --> 00:34:42.780
LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZES

00:34:42.847 --> 00:34:44.382
DIFFERENT GOALS AND DIFFERENT.

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:46.150
ACTIVITIES -- WHETHER THAT BE

00:34:46.217 --> 00:34:48.252
GREENHOUSE GASES -- REDUCTIONS

00:34:48.319 --> 00:34:49.720
AND LOCAL AIR POLLUTANTS FIND AN

00:34:49.787 --> 00:34:51.722
ADAPTATION ACTIVITIES ALL THESE

00:34:51.789 --> 00:34:53.291
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS YOU HAVE A A

00:34:53.357 --> 00:34:54.158
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FOCUS IN

00:34:54.225 --> 00:34:55.226
THOSE AREAS AND SO A LOT OF

00:34:55.293 --> 00:34:56.894
THESE DECISIONS AROUND AROUND

00:34:56.961 --> 00:34:58.396
YOUR PRIORITIES.

00:34:58.463 --> 00:35:00.264
I DO WANT TO NOTE -- ON THE

00:35:00.331 --> 00:35:02.200
GREENHOUSE GAS SIDE -- I'LL JUST

00:35:02.266 --> 00:35:04.101
KIND OF RE EMPHASIZE SOME OF OUR

00:35:04.168 --> 00:35:05.036
EARLIER COMMENTS AROUND YOU KNOW

00:35:05.102 --> 00:35:06.604
IT'S REALLY AND WE THINK IT'S

00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:08.039
REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT.

00:35:08.105 --> 00:35:09.307
HOW THE SPENDING FITS AND TO

00:35:09.373 --> 00:35:10.641
KIND OF THE OVERALL CLIMATE

00:35:10.708 --> 00:35:11.843
STRATEGY THAT THE STATE HAS HOW

00:35:11.909 --> 00:35:13.878
IT FITS IN WITH THE CAP AND

00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:15.446
TRADE PROGRAM AND THINKING ABOUT

00:35:15.513 --> 00:35:16.948
HOW HOW THINGS INTERACTION?

00:35:17.014 --> 00:35:18.783
AND WHERE SPENDING CAN KIND OF

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:21.052
DO ADDITIONAL YOUR CONCURRED

00:35:21.118 --> 00:35:22.320
ADDITIONAL EMISSION REDUCTIONS

00:35:22.386 --> 00:35:23.621
WERE OTHER POLICIES AREN'T

00:35:23.688 --> 00:35:24.222
ENCOURAGING THOUGH SO THINGS

00:35:24.288 --> 00:35:25.823
LIKE SPENDING ON THINGS OUTSIDE

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:28.025
OF THE THE CAP SECTOR IN THE CAP

00:35:28.092 --> 00:35:29.994
AND TRADE PROGRAM -- ENCOURAGING

00:35:30.061 --> 00:35:31.662
ME OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION

00:35:31.729 --> 00:35:32.997
THOSE TYPES OF THINGS.

00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:34.131
AND ONE LAST THING I'LL

00:35:34.198 --> 00:35:40.805
EMPHASIZE.

00:35:40.872 --> 00:35:42.373
AS WELL IS -- YOU'RE THINKING

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:42.907
ABOUT.

00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:43.975
AGAIN CALIFORNIA'S PLACE AND

00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:44.609
GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:35:44.675 --> 00:35:45.476
AND CALIFORNIA'S ROUGHLY 1% OF

00:35:45.543 --> 00:35:47.011
GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS --

00:35:47.078 --> 00:35:48.880
TRYING TO THINK STRATEGICALLY.

00:35:48.946 --> 00:35:49.714
AROUND.

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:51.249
HOW THE STATE CAN DO THE MOST TO

00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:52.717
ENCOURAGE A MEASURE OF OPTIONS

00:35:52.783 --> 00:35:54.685
HERE AS WELL AS REDUCTIONS IN

00:35:54.752 --> 00:35:56.187
OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND SO WHAT

00:35:56.254 --> 00:35:57.755
TYPES OF POLICIES ARE MOST

00:35:57.822 --> 00:35:59.257
LIKELY TO DO THAT WHETHER THAT'S?

00:35:59.323 --> 00:36:01.158
YOU KNOW -- DEMONSTRATING THE

00:36:01.225 --> 00:36:02.693
POLICY CAN BE ADOPTED HERE AYE

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.395
AYE AS WELL AS AND AND AND KIND

00:36:04.462 --> 00:36:05.630
OF ENCOURAGE OTHER JURISDICTIONS

00:36:05.696 --> 00:36:06.931
TO ADOPT A SIMILAR TYPE OF

00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:07.465
POLICY OR WHETHER THAT'S

00:36:07.532 --> 00:36:08.499
ENCOURAGING.

00:36:08.566 --> 00:36:09.867
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION TO

00:36:09.934 --> 00:36:11.002
PROMOTE TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN

00:36:11.068 --> 00:36:12.503
THEN BE ADOPTED IN OTHER

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:13.671
JURISDICTIONS.

00:36:13.738 --> 00:36:14.238
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

00:36:14.305 --> 00:36:14.839
CONSIDERATIONS NOW LOOK AT IN

00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:16.374
THIS FUNDING BUT WE THINK THAT'S

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.241
ONE IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN

00:36:17.308 --> 00:36:19.210
MIND PARTICULARLY FROM A

00:36:19.277 --> 00:36:22.647
GREENHOUSE GAS PERSPECTIVE SO.

00:36:22.713 --> 00:36:24.615
WELL IN MY COMMENTS AND THANK

00:36:24.682 --> 00:36:26.117

JOB OF OF GIVING AN OVERALL --

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.702
IT IS CONSISTENT WITH NOT JUST

00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:49.173
AB FOR THIRTY TWO BUT ALSO

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:49.774
EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT AND

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:50.875
THE INTENTIONS BEHIND THAT.

00:36:50.942 --> 00:36:52.443
THE THE PLAN DOES.

BACK THROUGH THE MAY PROCESS.

00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:04.488
I THINK TYPICALLY WE'VE DONE

00:37:04.555 --> 00:37:06.223
THIS IS WE GO BACK AND

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.926
REEVALUATE THE REVENUE

00:37:08.993 --> 00:37:10.061
PROJECTIONS.

00:37:10.127 --> 00:37:11.796
AND GIVEN THAT THE FEBRUARY

00:37:11.862 --> 00:37:14.165
AUCTION CAME IN MUCH HIGHER THAN.

00:37:14.231 --> 00:37:17.268
THAN ORIGINAL -- ESTIMATES WE

00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:18.536
WILL BE RE WORKING ALL OF THAT

00:37:18.603 --> 00:37:19.337
SO.

00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:26.377
MORE TO COME -- THE PLAN DOES.

00:37:26.444 --> 00:37:30.881
DOES CENTER ON PROVIDING THE

ARE ALLOCATED THE ADMINISTRATION

00:37:45.529 --> 00:37:50.468
ALLOCATES BASED ON A MULTIPLE --

HARDLY -- LOOK AT THE

00:42:58.809 --> 00:43:00.477
ADMINISTRATION'S SICK A PROPOSED

00:43:00.544 --> 00:43:02.079
EXPENDITURE PLAN AND MISS THE

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:03.547
FACT THAT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE

FUNDED AND THE LAST CYCLE -- AND

00:43:19.029 --> 00:43:30.941
I'M WONDERING WHY THAT IS. FOR

00:43:31.008 --> 00:43:32.843
SOME OF THEM.

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.345
THEY HAVE ALTERNATE FUNDING

00:43:34.411 --> 00:43:36.680
SOURCES SO SOME OF THEM ARE

00:43:36.747 --> 00:43:39.616
FUNDED WITH -- PROP SIXTY EIGHT

00:43:39.683 --> 00:43:42.319

NATURAL RESOURCES.

00:43:44.188 --> 00:43:46.690
AGENCIES FUNDING WILL BE BACK

00:43:46.757 --> 00:43:48.726
FILLED USING THE PROP SIXTY

00:43:48.792 --> 00:43:49.827
EIGHT MONEY SO IS THAT THE

00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:51.729
ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION THAT

00:43:51.795 --> 00:43:55.666
PROP SIXTY EIGHT WAS -- OF THAT

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:57.701
THE VOTERS VOTED ON PROP SIXTY

00:43:57.768 --> 00:43:59.436
EIGHT TO SUPPLANT -- WHAT WE

00:43:59.503 --> 00:44:01.405
WERE ALREADY DOING NOT

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:03.007
WHATSOEVER VETERANS -- EVER WE

00:44:03.073 --> 00:44:07.044
ALSO HAVE QUITE A BIT OF KERRY

00:44:07.111 --> 00:44:08.012
OVER IN SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS.

00:44:08.078 --> 00:44:10.014
SO THEY'VE GOT PREVIOUS YEARS

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.148
THAT THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO GET

00:44:11.215 --> 00:44:12.916
OUT THE DOOR.

00:44:12.983 --> 00:44:14.718
WELL THAT'S THAT'S DIFFERENT --

00:44:14.785 --> 00:44:16.153
AND I WOULD APPRECIATE SEEING AN

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:20.324
ANALYSIS OF THAT -- BUT I'D I

00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:21.325
THINK YOU KNOW FROM MY

00:44:21.392 --> 00:44:22.526
PERSPECTIVE IT'S PRETTY CLEAR

00:44:22.593 --> 00:44:24.661
THAT VOTERS EXPECTED TO

00:44:24.728 --> 00:44:25.295
SUPPLEMENT WHAT WE ARE ALREADY

00:44:25.362 --> 00:44:26.964
DOING THEY WANTED MORE OF THE

00:44:27.031 --> 00:44:27.798
SAME.

00:44:27.865 --> 00:44:31.769
NOT -- JUST -- SHIFT OVER THE

00:44:31.835 --> 00:44:34.204
WAIVER ACCOUNTING CUTS FOR

00:44:34.271 --> 00:44:36.273
EXISTING EXPENDITURES OTHERWISE

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.274
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MOTIVATION

00:44:37.341 --> 00:44:38.876
FOR VOTING -- AFTER THE MEASURE

00:44:38.942 --> 00:44:43.647
WOULD HAVE BEEN -- SO I I

00:44:43.714 --> 00:44:46.817
FRANKLY THINK WE NEED TO REALLY --

00:44:46.884 --> 00:44:47.985
RETHINK THAT PART OF THE

00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:50.788

AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE LIST --

00:45:01.498 --> 00:45:02.633
THERE'S TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.443
A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE

00:45:12.509 --> 00:45:13.844
FOCUSING ON DISADVANTAGED

00:45:13.911 --> 00:45:15.612

00:45:44.675 --> 00:45:45.909
A LOT OF PARTS THAT THE

00:45:45.976 --> 00:45:47.377
STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL IS

00:45:47.444 --> 00:45:50.814
PULLING FROM THEY'VE GOT -- THE

00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:52.082
TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE

00:45:52.149 --> 00:45:53.750
COMMUNITIES AND THEY CAN USE A

00:45:53.817 --> 00:45:54.751
PORTION OF THAT.

00:45:54.818 --> 00:45:57.721
AS WELL FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

00:45:57.788 --> 00:46:00.457
FOR THE LOCALS.

00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:02.292
WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF LOCAL

00:46:02.359 --> 00:46:04.895
ASSISTANCE JUST JUST. TO WRAP IT

00:46:04.962 --> 00:46:06.130
ALL IN TOGETHER THERE ARE A LOT

00:46:06.196 --> 00:46:07.531
OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:09.900
GOING ON TO HELP THE LOCALS. FOR

00:46:09.967 --> 00:46:12.336
EXAMPLE THE AB.

00:46:12.402 --> 00:46:14.538
SIX SEVENTEEN IS REALLY FOCUSING

00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:18.742
ON LOCAL AND REGIONAL NEEDS.

00:46:18.809 --> 00:46:20.511
AND WORKING WITH AND DEVELOPING

00:46:20.577 --> 00:46:23.247
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS SPECIFICALLY

00:46:23.313 --> 00:46:24.448
WITH IN THESE.

00:46:24.515 --> 00:46:26.717
REGIONS TO GIVE THE LOCALS AND

00:46:26.783 --> 00:46:27.918
WE KNOW THAT THOSE.

00:46:27.985 --> 00:46:31.588
THE THE AB SIX SEVENTEEN HAS

00:46:31.655 --> 00:46:32.623
TARGETED.

00:46:32.689 --> 00:46:35.359
THE THE HIGHEST RISK AND WE KNOW

00:46:35.425 --> 00:46:36.693
THAT THOSE ARE THE DISADVANTAGED

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.695
COMMUNITIES WERE TARGETING THOSE

00:46:38.762 --> 00:46:40.063
WELL SO IF THERE ARE IS

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:41.598
SUFFICIENT FUNDING FROM OTHER

00:46:41.665 --> 00:46:43.500
SOURCES -- I THINK WOULD BE

00:46:43.567 --> 00:46:44.902
IMPORTANT TO HAVE FOR THE

00:46:44.968 --> 00:46:46.170
COMMITTEE TO SEE AN ANALYSIS

00:46:46.236 --> 00:46:47.704
THAT SHOWS WHERE THAT MONEY'S

00:46:47.771 --> 00:46:49.406
COMING FROM OF WHAT THE DEMAND

00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:52.476
IS AND HOW THAT DEMAND IS -- IS

00:46:52.543 --> 00:46:55.078
ADEQUATELY OF BEING BEING THAT I

00:46:55.145 --> 00:46:57.447
WAS QUITE SURPRISED TO SEE THIS --

00:46:57.514 --> 00:46:59.316
A COMPLETELY THIS ITEM

00:46:59.383 --> 00:47:03.420
COMPLETELY DE FUNDED -- WHY

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:04.555
DON'T WE TAKE ROLE SO THAT WITH

00:47:04.621 --> 00:47:05.689
STATUS QUORUM JUST IN CASE

00:47:05.756 --> 00:47:06.857
SOMEBODY NEEDS?

00:47:06.924 --> 00:47:09.092
TO TAKE OFF AND THEN WILL --

00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:10.427
CONTINUE WITH QUESTIONS OF THE

00:47:10.494 --> 00:47:11.495
LOOKS LIKE OTHER MEMBERS HAVE

00:47:11.562 --> 00:47:12.529

THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

00:48:44.821 --> 00:48:46.089

A COUPLE OF A COUPLE OF AREAS.

00:49:04.641 --> 00:49:06.076
SO IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT

00:49:06.143 --> 00:49:07.110
REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS

00:49:07.177 --> 00:49:09.246
EMISSIONS.

00:49:09.313 --> 00:49:10.480
I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT A

00:49:10.547 --> 00:49:12.049
COUPLE OF SIGNIFICANT BUDGET CUT

00:49:12.115 --> 00:49:13.550
AREAS AND VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:15.452
PROGRAMS.

00:49:15.519 --> 00:49:16.853
THAT ARE DOING A TERRIFIC JOB

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:17.988
THE DERRY METHANE REDUCTION

00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:21.091
PROGRAM -- BY THE

00:49:21.158 --> 00:49:23.927
ADMINISTRATION'S OWN ANALYSIS.

00:49:23.994 --> 00:49:25.696
SAYS IT IS PROVING THE GREATEST

00:49:25.762 --> 00:49:27.497
GHG REDUCTION OF ALL FUNDED

00:49:27.564 --> 00:49:28.999
PROGRAMS.

00:49:29.066 --> 00:49:30.867
AND THAT IS THE SECOND MOST COST

00:49:30.934 --> 00:49:32.202
EFFECTIVE AT EIGHT TO NINE

00:49:32.269 --> 00:49:33.170
DOLLARS PER TON [inaudible]

00:49:33.236 --> 00:49:35.005
A REDUCTION.

00:49:35.072 --> 00:49:37.307
WHY THEN IS THIS PROGRAM GOING

00:49:37.374 --> 00:49:46.183
TO SEE THESE MASSIVE CUTS?

00:49:46.249 --> 00:49:48.118
SO AGAIN THE ADMINISTRATION HAD

00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:49.986
GONE THROUGH ALL OF THE CORE

00:49:50.053 --> 00:49:51.221
PROGRAMS.

00:49:51.288 --> 00:49:52.789
THERE'S STILL RE APPROPRIATED

00:49:52.856 --> 00:49:54.224
FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR THE

00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:56.093
METHANE FROM PRIOR YEARS THAT

00:49:56.159 --> 00:49:57.661
HASN'T GONE OUT YET.

00:49:57.728 --> 00:50:01.431
SO. TO JUST KEEP PUTTING IN.

00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:02.999
ADDITIONAL FUNDING.

00:50:03.066 --> 00:50:04.868
DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE IF

00:50:04.935 --> 00:50:05.502
IT'S NOT GONNA GET OUT THE DOOR

00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:06.436
RIGHT AWAY.

00:50:06.503 --> 00:50:08.872
SO THIS IS JUST A REGENERATING.

00:50:08.939 --> 00:50:10.807
OF SOME OF WHAT.

00:50:10.874 --> 00:50:12.976
PROGRAMS ARE CONTINUING TO GET

00:50:13.043 --> 00:50:15.011
OUT THE DOOR AND WE CAN ALWAYS

00:50:15.078 --> 00:50:16.713
REVISIT.

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.782
IN ANOTHER PLAN SO IF.

00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:20.016
YOU'RE WILLING.

00:50:20.083 --> 00:50:21.351
TO IF THE FUNDS ARE NOT FULLY

00:50:21.418 --> 00:50:23.286
SUBSCRIBE.

00:50:23.353 --> 00:50:24.254
TO AND THEY GET FULLY SUBSCRIBED

00:50:24.321 --> 00:50:25.956
IN SIX MONTHS NINE MONTHS INTO A

00:50:26.022 --> 00:50:27.324
BUDGET YEAR.

00:50:27.391 --> 00:50:29.993
ARE YOU TELLING US THAT.

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:32.863
WE CAN GO BACK AND AND WE VISIT.

00:50:32.929 --> 00:50:35.699
THESE HUGE CUTS IN A FUTURE YEAR

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:39.636
NOT IN NOT IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

00:50:39.703 --> 00:50:41.738
BUT THAT'S NOT SATISFACTORY TO

00:50:41.805 --> 00:50:43.240
ME AND TO THE PEOPLE I REPRESENT

00:50:43.306 --> 00:50:45.108
CENTRAL CALIFORNIA.

00:50:45.175 --> 00:50:46.443
SIMILARLY THE FARMER PROGRAMS

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:48.412
FUNDED MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED

00:50:48.478 --> 00:50:49.946
PROJECTS TO REDUCE GHG AND

00:50:50.013 --> 00:50:51.715
IMPROVE AIR QUALITY.

00:50:51.782 --> 00:50:53.550
ESPECIALLY IN DISADVANTAGED AND

00:50:53.617 --> 00:50:55.452
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES.

00:50:55.519 --> 00:50:57.154
CARP HAS IDENTIFIED TWO HUNDRED

00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:58.422
AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS THE

00:50:58.488 --> 00:50:59.923
NECESSARY AMOUNT TO CONTINUE

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:01.625
SUPPORTING THIS PROGRAM.

00:51:01.691 --> 00:51:03.560
AGAIN IF YOU CARE ABOUT CENTRAL

00:51:03.627 --> 00:51:04.694
CALIFORNIA.

00:51:04.761 --> 00:51:05.829
AND IF YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT

00:51:05.896 --> 00:51:06.963
REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:11.001
EMISSIONS AS MUCH AS THE

00:51:11.067 --> 00:51:11.568
MINISTRATION SAYS IT DOES.

00:51:11.635 --> 00:51:13.003
WHY IS THE FORMER BUDGET BEING

00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:17.908
CUT TO JUST TWENTY FIVE MILLION?

00:51:17.974 --> 00:51:19.876
THERE ARE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES

00:51:19.943 --> 00:51:20.777
FOR THE AGRICULTURAL

00:51:20.844 --> 00:51:23.647
REPLACEMENTS AND THE HEAVY DUTY.

00:51:23.713 --> 00:51:25.415
WE'VE GOT OTHER INVESTMENTS THE

00:51:25.482 --> 00:51:27.717
FARMER PROGRAM IS NOT JUST

00:51:27.784 --> 00:51:31.555
SUPPORTED BY -- THE GREENHOUSE

00:51:31.621 --> 00:51:33.256
GAS REDUCTION FUND.

00:51:33.323 --> 00:51:34.458
BUT I BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THE

00:51:34.524 --> 00:51:36.092
CARL MOYER LSO CAN GO TOWARDS

00:51:36.159 --> 00:51:39.796
THIS.

00:51:39.863 --> 00:51:40.997
THIS IS A HUGE CUT FROM LAST

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:43.600
YEAR [inaudible]

00:51:43.667 --> 00:51:45.869
WHAT'S CHANGED.

00:51:45.936 --> 00:51:47.804
IN BOTH OF THESE INSTANCES

00:51:47.871 --> 00:51:48.104
[inaudible]

00:51:48.171 --> 00:51:50.707
WHAT'S CHANGED.

00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:54.644
WHY THE SLASH WELL?

00:51:54.711 --> 00:51:56.179
THIS IS ALWAYS A ONE TIME

00:51:56.246 --> 00:51:59.015
ALLOCATION EACH YEAR

00:51:59.082 --> 00:51:59.316
[inaudible]

00:51:59.382 --> 00:52:04.754
WITH THE THE VINTAGE ALLOWANCES.

00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:06.723
PRETTY MUCH BEING SOLD OUT NOW

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:08.325
SO WE'VE SOLD ALL OF THE VINTAGE.

00:52:08.391 --> 00:52:09.960
UP TO THIS POINT IS MY

00:52:10.026 --> 00:52:11.394
UNDERSTANDING.

00:52:11.461 --> 00:52:13.697
AND THAT'S WHY OUR REVENUE

00:52:13.763 --> 00:52:15.131
PROJECTIONS ARE ALSO.

00:52:15.198 --> 00:52:16.333
VERY DIFFERENT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

00:52:16.399 --> 00:52:19.135
PROJECTING ADDITIONAL VINTAGE

00:52:19.202 --> 00:52:22.772

00:52:22.839 --> 00:52:23.273
THE LOANS.

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:25.208
IT'S FROM PREVIOUS YEARS THAT

00:52:25.275 --> 00:52:27.277
WERE THAT WENT UNSOLD.

00:52:27.344 --> 00:52:28.612
YOU TALK ABOUT THAT DID THE DID

00:52:28.678 --> 00:52:31.982
THE IN THE OUTRAGE THE CAP AND

00:52:32.048 --> 00:52:33.783
ROCKS RIGHT IN THE AUCTIONS SO

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:36.887
THE THE THE AUCTION PROCEEDS.

00:52:36.953 --> 00:52:39.322
WILL BE NOT NEARLY AS HIGH AS

00:52:39.389 --> 00:52:42.459
WHAT WE SAW IN SAY.

00:52:42.526 --> 00:52:43.593
TWENTY EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.628
SEVENTEEN THOSE WERE THOSE WERE

00:52:44.694 --> 00:52:46.263
HUGE AMOUNTS AND WE HAVE LARGE

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:49.399
BALANCES AND WE DON'T ANTICIPATE

00:52:49.466 --> 00:52:53.169
THAT MOVING FORWARD -- THE L. A.

00:52:53.236 --> 00:52:55.205
O. IS NOT HERE.

00:52:55.272 --> 00:52:58.074

00:53:09.252 --> 00:53:12.255
PREDICT GREATER.

00:53:12.322 --> 00:53:14.024
CAP AND CAP AND TRADE MONEY.

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:14.658
THAN WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

00:53:14.724 --> 00:53:17.193
PROPOSING.

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:19.329
YES SO OUR PROJECTIONS ARE OVER

00:53:19.396 --> 00:53:20.630
THE CURRENT YEAR AND OVER THE

00:53:20.697 --> 00:53:22.098
BUDGET YEAR THAT REVENUE WILL BE

00:53:22.165 --> 00:53:23.934
ROUGHLY EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.268
DOLLARS HIGHER THAN WHAT THE

00:53:25.335 --> 00:53:27.003
ADMINISTRATION WAS PROJECTING

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:28.838
NOW SOME OF THAT MONEY IS

00:53:28.905 --> 00:53:30.373
CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED TO

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:31.841
CERTAIN YES A TO CERTAIN

00:53:31.908 --> 00:53:32.976
PROGRAMS.

00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:34.277
BUT YOU KNOW ONCE THAT MONEY IT

00:53:34.344 --> 00:53:35.879
IS KIND OF ALLOCATED TO THOSE

00:53:35.946 --> 00:53:37.614
PROGRAMS AND THERE WOULD BE NO

00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:39.416
ROUGHLY AN ADDITIONAL THREE

00:53:39.482 --> 00:53:40.884
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:41.952
AVAILABLE TO BE SPENT SOME OF

00:53:42.018 --> 00:53:43.386
THAT YOU MIGHT NEED TO BE LEFT

00:53:43.453 --> 00:53:44.888
IN RESERVE TO BUDGET FRONT

00:53:44.955 --> 00:53:46.990
CERTAINTY BUT ONE EXAMPLE WE

00:53:47.057 --> 00:53:47.257
LAID OUT.

00:53:47.324 --> 00:53:48.825
IS YOU KNOW WITH UNDER OUR

00:53:48.892 --> 00:53:50.360
REVENUE PROJECTIONS IF THE

00:53:50.427 --> 00:53:52.262
LEGISLATURE ALLOCATED A COUPLE

00:53:52.329 --> 00:53:53.430
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MORE

00:53:53.496 --> 00:53:55.065
THERE WOULD STILL BE OVER TWO

00:53:55.131 --> 00:53:55.966
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS LEFT IN

00:53:56.032 --> 00:53:57.000
THE FUND AT THE END OF THE YEAR

00:53:57.067 --> 00:53:58.301
AND WE THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A

00:53:58.368 --> 00:53:59.502
REASONABLE FUND BALANCE. FOR THE

00:53:59.569 --> 00:54:02.505
PREDICATE ON YOUR CUTS.

00:54:02.572 --> 00:54:07.143
IS THAT YOU'RE NOT EXPECTING --

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:10.547
SUBSTANTIAL.

00:54:10.614 --> 00:54:12.015
STABILITY I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY

00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:14.584
IN THE AUCTIONS.

00:54:14.651 --> 00:54:17.387
AND YET WE NOW THAT WE HAVE THE

00:54:17.454 --> 00:54:17.954
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

00:54:18.021 --> 00:54:20.056
SAYING THAT.

00:54:20.123 --> 00:54:22.258
WE WE CAN TEST THAT.

00:54:22.325 --> 00:54:23.994
THAT POINT OF VIEW.

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.996
MY ONLY POINT IS.

00:54:26.062 --> 00:54:29.532
THESE ARE HUGE DRAMATIC CUTS.

00:54:29.599 --> 00:54:30.834
AND IF IT'S PREDICATED ON

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:33.003
CAUTION.

00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:34.571
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:54:34.638 --> 00:54:35.839
BUT WE HAVE A DIFFERENT POINT OF

00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:37.507
VIEW HERE WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:54:37.574 --> 00:54:37.941
LEDGE OFFICE AND THE

00:54:38.008 --> 00:54:39.409
ADMINISTRATION.

00:54:39.476 --> 00:54:40.977
I JUST WANT TO GO ON RECORD THAT

00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:42.646
THAT THE WI YOU'RE CUTTING THE

00:54:42.712 --> 00:54:44.514
VERY PROGRAMS.

00:54:44.581 --> 00:54:46.082
IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA.

00:54:46.149 --> 00:54:48.018
DISADVANTAGED AREAS IN THESE TWO

00:54:48.084 --> 00:54:50.587
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE A HUGE

00:54:50.654 --> 00:54:51.988
PERFORMANCE HISTORY IN DOING

00:54:52.055 --> 00:54:54.324
PRECISELY WHAT.

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:55.425
STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAYS WE WANT

00:54:55.492 --> 00:54:56.860
TO DO AND I FIND THAT VERY

00:54:56.926 --> 00:54:59.229
DIFFICULT TO SWALLOW.

00:54:59.295 --> 00:55:01.398
NOTED I IT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO

00:55:01.464 --> 00:55:03.400
POINT OUT THAT TOO WITH SOME OF

00:55:03.466 --> 00:55:05.201
THE DISCRETIONARY FUNDING.

00:55:05.268 --> 00:55:07.871
THE WE'VE ALREADY THE

00:55:07.937 --> 00:55:08.972
LEGISLATURE IN THE

00:55:09.039 --> 00:55:10.607
ADMINISTRATION OF ALREADY.

00:55:10.674 --> 00:55:12.842
COMMITTED SOME OF IT TO ONGOING

00:55:12.909 --> 00:55:15.679
FUNDING. FOR EXAMPLE THE CVR P.

00:55:15.745 --> 00:55:18.281
THE THE VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM

00:55:18.348 --> 00:55:21.751
AND THE SP NINE A ONE FOR THE

00:55:21.818 --> 00:55:23.053
FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAMS.

00:55:23.119 --> 00:55:24.988
SO THAT'S AS WE START DOING

00:55:25.055 --> 00:55:26.489
THOSE ON GOING YEAR AFTER YEAR

00:55:26.556 --> 00:55:28.625
COMMITMENTS IT'S GOING TO

00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:31.561
SQUEEZE OUT SOME OF THE OTHER --

00:55:31.628 --> 00:55:32.862
DISCRETIONARY FUNDING

00:55:32.929 --> 00:55:33.163
[inaudible]

00:55:33.229 --> 00:55:36.199
AND AS I HAD MENTIONED EARLIER

00:55:36.266 --> 00:55:37.200
AND I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU WERE

00:55:37.267 --> 00:55:38.601
IN THE ROOM WHEN WHEN WE FIRST

00:55:38.668 --> 00:55:39.402
STARTED.

00:55:39.469 --> 00:55:41.237
BUT THAT.

00:55:41.304 --> 00:55:42.639
WE ALWAYS GO BACK THE

00:55:42.706 --> 00:55:44.507
ADMINISTRATION ALWAYS REVIEWS

00:55:44.574 --> 00:55:47.544
REVENUES AGAIN AT MAY REVISE.

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:50.747
AND YES WE HAVE DEFERRED AND AND

00:55:50.814 --> 00:55:52.549
WITH THE LA -- THE LA -- AND THE

00:55:52.615 --> 00:55:54.150
ADMINISTRATION WE'VE BEEN WE'VE

00:55:54.217 --> 00:55:56.186
BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS AND WE KNOW

00:55:56.252 --> 00:55:58.021
WHERE THE DIFFERENCES ARE.

00:55:58.088 --> 00:55:59.789
AND MOST OF OUR ASSUMPTIONS ARE

00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:02.125
CORRECT THE ONLY REAL BIG

00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:03.560
DIFFERENCE IS THE NUMBER OF

00:56:03.626 --> 00:56:08.531
ALLOWANCES THAT WILL BE OPTION.

00:56:08.598 --> 00:56:10.533
SO ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT I'VE.

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:11.735
I SHOULD BE LOOKING TO A MAY

00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:13.770
REVISE FOR RECALCULATION IN

00:56:13.837 --> 00:56:14.571
CONSIDERATION ON THESE TWO

00:56:14.637 --> 00:56:16.606

SUGGESTED.

00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:32.122
IT'S STILL UNDER DISCUSSION.

00:58:35.678 --> 00:58:37.881
DECISIONS -- HELP ME UNDERSTAND

IN GETTING 35% OUT TO THE

00:59:06.609 --> 00:59:07.844
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THE

00:59:07.911 --> 00:59:10.013
LOW INCOME -- COMMUNITIES AND

SUCH AS OUR TRANSPORTATION IS A

00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:27.864
HUGE.

00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:30.066
PORTION OF THIS.

TRANSPARENT ALLOWS THE PUBLIC TO

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:14.744
SEE THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:16.245
ACHIEVE THESE ARE THE STATUTE

01:00:16.312 --> 01:00:16.913
THAT WE HAVE TO DO.

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:20.149
SO THAT WE WE ARE HAGGLING -- WE

01:00:20.216 --> 01:00:21.584
WILL WE'RE ALWAYS GONNA HAGGLE I

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:22.585
GUESS FOR THE OVER THE AMOUNTS

01:00:22.652 --> 01:00:24.787
BUT I GUESS THAT WE UNDERSTAND

01:00:24.854 --> 01:00:27.023
WHY THESE CUTS OR AUGMENTATIONS

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:29.092
ARE HAPPENING.

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:31.260
I THINK RIGHT NOW IT'S THE THE

01:00:31.327 --> 01:00:34.297
VIEW THAT I SEE IS THAT -- THESE

01:00:34.364 --> 01:00:36.566
DECISIONS ARE VERY SPORADIC WE

01:00:36.632 --> 01:00:38.167
DON'T I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

01:00:38.234 --> 01:00:40.636
WE'RE CUTTING -- UP OF ONE

01:00:40.703 --> 01:00:42.739
PROGRAM SIGNIFICANTLY THAT IS

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:44.507
VERY VERY COST EFFECTIVE AND

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:46.175
THAT WE MAY BE FUNDING -- A

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:47.744
PROGRAM THAT IS NOT SO COST

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:49.178
EFFECTIVE AND AS IF COST

01:00:49.245 --> 01:00:50.513
EFFECTIVENESS IS ONE OF THE

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:51.748
CRITERIA WHICH I BELIEVE IT

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:54.083
SHOULD BE IN TERMS OF THE THE

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:55.752
MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:57.086
REDUCING GHGS.

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:58.988
THAT SHOULD PROBABLY BE THE NO

01:00:59.055 --> 01:01:01.190
ONE PRIORITY AND IF WE'RE NOT.

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:02.725
ABIDING BY THAT CRITERIA THAT

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:04.227
EVERYONE AGREES SHOULD BE THE

01:01:04.293 --> 01:01:06.195
CRITERIA THEN MAYBE WE THROUGH

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:06.929
VALUE WAY.

01:01:06.996 --> 01:01:08.364
OUR OUR SPENDING.

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:11.334
THAT MAKES SENSE.

01:01:11.401 --> 01:01:12.301
SO IS THAT POSSIBLE IS IT WITH

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:13.469
THE LA I'LL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:16.072
THAT LIST OF OR WITH THE

01:01:16.139 --> 01:01:17.306
DEPARTMENT FINANCE BE ABLE.

01:01:17.373 --> 01:01:18.674
TO PROVIDE THAT IN ADDITION TO

01:01:18.741 --> 01:01:21.244
THE MAY REVISE A HERE'S OUR

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:22.545
EXPENDITURE PLAN AND HERE'S A

01:01:22.612 --> 01:01:24.414
CRITERIA THAT WE USE TO

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:28.317
DETERMINE THE EXPECTED PLAN.

01:01:28.384 --> 01:01:29.786
WE CAN PROBABLY WE WE CAN

01:01:29.852 --> 01:01:31.654
PROBABLY CRAFT SOMETHING THAT

01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:32.622
THAT WOULD.

01:01:32.688 --> 01:01:35.091
WOULD ELIMINATE SOME OF OUR

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:36.426
REASONING BEHIND THIS.

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:39.395
BUT AGAIN THERE IS THERE IS THAT

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:40.930
ONE COMPONENT THAT IF WE'RE

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:43.599
GOING TO CONTINUE WITH THE ON

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:45.068
GOING COMMITMENTS THAT WE'VE

01:01:45.134 --> 01:01:46.736
ALREADY MADE.

01:01:46.803 --> 01:01:48.838
THAT THAT I'M AWARE OF WE DIDN'T

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:50.206
OTHER THAN THE WORK FORCE --

01:01:50.273 --> 01:01:51.741
DEVELOPMENT.

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:53.242
TRAINING AND THE EIGHTEEN

01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:54.544
MILLION ADDITIONAL FOR THE

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:57.313
HEALTHY SOILS.

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.748
I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:04.053
INCREASED OVER CURRENT YEAR.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:04.720
AND TO MY LAST QUESTION MISTER

01:02:04.787 --> 01:02:06.556
MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE

01:02:06.622 --> 01:02:08.191
THE TIME IS IT.

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:09.892
IS THERE UNDERSTANDING THAT.

01:02:09.959 --> 01:02:14.163
THE THAT THESE PROGRAMS -- ARE

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:16.032
ALWAYS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:17.066
EVERY YEAR AND IT.

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:18.434
IS IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:20.136
THAT THE NUMBERS CAN CUT BECAUSE

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:21.637
OF MIKE MY FEAR IS THAT YOU

01:02:21.704 --> 01:02:22.338
YOU'RE.

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:23.206
YOU'RE NOT PROVIDING ANY

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:25.508
CERTAINTY TO THOSE WHO ARE

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:28.044
TRYING TO REDUCE AN AND ABIDE BY

01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:31.681
THE THE STATUES SO YOU'RE ASKING.

01:02:31.747 --> 01:02:32.415
FOR EXAMPLE THE AGRICULTURE

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:34.650
INDUSTRY TO ACHIEVE THESE OALS

01:02:34.717 --> 01:02:36.185
AND THEN YOU OUTLINED THESE

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:37.820
THESE FUNDING LEVELS AND THEY'RE

01:02:37.887 --> 01:02:40.957
PLANNING LONG TERM. TO TO TRY TO

01:02:41.023 --> 01:02:42.325
MEET THE GOALS SET FORTH BY THE

01:02:42.391 --> 01:02:44.127
ADMINISTRATION AND THEN IN THE

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:46.095
MIDDLE OF THE PROCESS YOU SAY I

01:02:46.162 --> 01:02:47.663
CHANGED MY MIND WE'RE NOT GOING

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:48.764
TO GIVE YOU THE FUNDING LEVELS

01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:50.399
THAT YOU'RE EXPECTING.

01:02:50.466 --> 01:02:52.001
AND THEN YOU'RE EXPECTING THE TO

01:02:52.068 --> 01:02:53.169
SAY THAT MY EXAMPLE THAT

01:02:53.236 --> 01:02:55.138
CULTURAL COMMUNITY TO STILL HIT

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:56.139
THE GOALS.

01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:57.640
HI IT'S IT'S LIKE LUCY PULLING

01:02:57.707 --> 01:03:01.043
THE FOOTBALL AWAY AND SO.

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:02.378
HOW DO YOU EXPECT?

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:05.281
ANY INDUSTRY TO BE ABLE TO LONG

01:03:05.348 --> 01:03:07.783
TERM PLAN. TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:09.185
THAT THE MINISTRATION AND

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:10.219
PROBABLY THIS BODY WANTS TO

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:11.888
ACHIEVE WITHOUT PROVIDING THEM

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:13.789
WITH SOME CERTAINTY.

01:03:13.856 --> 01:03:16.492
ACKNOWLEDGING THE THE CHALLENGES

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:18.828
WITH ONE TIME FUNDING.

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:21.097
BUT THAT'S WHY WE THAT'S WHY THE

01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:22.198
ADMINISTRATION WITH THE

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:24.367
LEGISLATURE CRAFTED SOME OF THE

01:03:24.433 --> 01:03:26.602
ON GOING COMMITMENTS WAS TO

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:27.904
CARRY THAT THROUGH.

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:31.774
NOW IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO

01:03:31.841 --> 01:03:32.975
PROPOSE.

01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:35.178
ON GOING IT JUST SQUEEZES OUT

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:37.313
SOME OF THE OTHER ONE TIME SO IT

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.815
IS A MATTER OF OF TRYING TO

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:41.083
FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE RIGHT.

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:44.020
MIX AND PRIORITY SURE BECAUSE

01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:45.521
WE'VE GOT ALL OF THE STATUTORY

01:03:45.588 --> 01:03:48.024
THAT 60% SO WE'RE LEFT WITH40%

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:49.525
AND THEN ONCE WE'VE.

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:52.728
OBLIGATED A PORTION OF THAT.

01:03:52.795 --> 01:03:55.264
AS AN ONGOING RESOURCE.

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:57.600
THEN THERE'S THERE'S ONLY SO

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:59.835
MUCH THAT CAN GO AROUND SO I

01:03:59.902 --> 01:04:01.637
UNDERSTAND HOW.

01:04:01.704 --> 01:04:05.975
THE THE CHALLENGES WITH WITH.

01:04:06.042 --> 01:04:08.811
THE GOALS THAT THE STATE HAS

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:10.846
OVERALL IN ACHIEVING CLIMATE

01:04:10.913 --> 01:04:14.150
RESILIENCY GHG REDUCTIONS.

01:04:14.217 --> 01:04:17.553
AND HELPING THE DISADVANTAGED

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:19.121
AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES.

01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:20.456
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:23.426
CAN CONTINUE DISCUSSION ON

01:04:23.492 --> 01:04:24.527
CERTAINLY APPRECIATE AS ONE OF

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:26.262
THE DAILY OF RESPONSE IS THERE A

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:27.496
WAY THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE A LIST

01:04:27.563 --> 01:04:28.698
OF CRITERIA THAT SHOULD OR

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:30.399
SHOULD NOT BE.

01:04:30.466 --> 01:04:32.602
USED I I SEE THAT YOU'RE A RABBI

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:34.470
REVIEW TO REPORT BUT AND IS IT

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:35.771
IS IT IS THAT HELPFUL FROM A

01:04:35.838 --> 01:04:36.973
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND IN

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:38.741
TERMS OF EDUCATING THE PUBLIC

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:40.309
AND EDUCATE AND LEGISLATURE IN

01:04:40.376 --> 01:04:44.180
TERMS OF HOW THESE DECISIONS

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:45.648
SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE MADE.

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:46.382
YEAH I MEAN I THINK SOMETHING

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:47.917
LIKE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND I

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:49.585
THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGES

01:04:49.652 --> 01:04:52.154
TRYING TO TO KIND OF ESTIMATE

01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:54.490
WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE ASSOCIATED

01:04:54.557 --> 01:04:56.959
WITH EACH PARTICULAR PROGRAM AND

01:04:57.026 --> 01:04:57.526
I THINK.

01:04:57.593 --> 01:04:58.561
ANY OF THE YOUR POINT IS THAT A

01:04:58.628 --> 01:04:59.829
GOOD ONE THAT SORT OF YOU KNOW

01:04:59.895 --> 01:05:00.329
WE WANT TO TRY AND GET

01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:01.897
INFORMATION ON KIND OF WHAT EACH

01:05:01.964 --> 01:05:03.099
ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS.

01:05:03.165 --> 01:05:04.667
IS ACHIEVING AND THEN SORT OF

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:05.301
HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF

01:05:05.368 --> 01:05:06.168
HOW HOW THAN WERE SORT OF

01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:07.503
ALLOCATING FUNDS AND

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:08.938
PRIORITIZING AMONGST THOSE

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:10.873
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS -- ANY WE

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.108
DON'T HAVE A YOU KNOW WE DON'T

01:05:12.174 --> 01:05:12.875
HAVE THE ANSWER TO KIND OF WHY

01:05:12.942 --> 01:05:13.809
THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:05:13.876 --> 01:05:15.578
PRIORITIZING THINGS IN IN A

01:05:15.645 --> 01:05:17.113
PARTICULAR WAY BASED ON KIND OF

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:18.648
INFORMATION WE HAVE RIGHT NOW.

01:05:18.714 --> 01:05:19.715
BUT CERTAINLY KIND OF TRYING TO

01:05:19.782 --> 01:05:21.384
OUTLINE FOR EACH PROGRAM WHAT

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:23.019
TYPES OF BENEFITS ARE ARE YOU

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:24.253
EXPECTING TO ACHIEVE AND THEN

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.988
THE LEGISLATURE CAN THEN USE

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:27.290
THAT.

01:05:27.356 --> 01:05:28.057
TO KIND OF YOU KNOW -- YOU

01:05:28.124 --> 01:05:29.258
PRIORITIZE AMONG THOSE DIFFERENT

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:30.426
PROGRAMS BASED ON HOW IT

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:31.694
PRIORITIZE IS DIFFERENT THINGS

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:32.895
WHETHER THAT BE LOCAL AIR

01:05:32.962 --> 01:05:34.563
POLLUTION REDUCTIONS GREENHOUSE

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:37.867
GASES CLIMATE ADAPTATION SO.

01:05:37.933 --> 01:05:41.337
DOES LA WILL HAVE A FREE MARKET

01:05:41.404 --> 01:05:42.538
THAT.

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:44.040
CAN WORK OR DO YOU HAVE DO YOU

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:44.407
HAVE THE DATA.

01:05:44.473 --> 01:05:45.007
WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:46.842
THAT INFORMATION -- I'M RIGHT

01:05:46.909 --> 01:05:47.810
ANALYSIS.

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:49.645
I MEAN I I THINK PART OF THE

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:51.280
CHALLENGES WE DON'T HAVE.

01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:53.516
OF A LOT OF INFORMATION ON KIND

01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:55.584
OF PROJECTED OUTCOMES FOR EACH

01:05:55.651 --> 01:05:57.687
ONE OF THESE POTS OF MONEY WE DO

01:05:57.753 --> 01:05:59.522
HAVE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT KIND

01:05:59.588 --> 01:06:00.623
OF HOW THE MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:02.325
SO FAR AND SO WE CAN TRY TO KIND

01:06:02.391 --> 01:06:04.160
OF PULL INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE

01:06:04.226 --> 01:06:05.261
AVAILABLE ON KIND OF HOW.

THE MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT SO FAR

01:06:06.562 --> 01:06:07.630
AND WHAT IT HAS ACHIEVED BUT AS

01:06:07.697 --> 01:06:09.332
FAR AS KIND OF A PROJECTIONS

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:11.233
GOING FORWARD FOR EACH PROGRAM I

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:12.768
THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BE KIND

01:06:12.835 --> 01:06:13.836
OF GAPS THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED ON

01:06:13.903 --> 01:06:15.271
IN THE KIND OF CURRENT PROPOSALS

01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:16.238
THAT INFORMATION.

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:17.773

THANK YOU OFFICIAL TEMAS GERMAN

01:06:23.245 --> 01:06:26.415
THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THAT

MAYBE WE HELPFUL FOR ALL OF US.

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:28.517
MS RESTED YOU HAVE AN ADDITIONAL

01:06:28.584 --> 01:06:30.686
QUESTION.

ARE COMMON I DID TO CHAIR OF MY

01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:33.289
INITIAL COMMENTS WERE IN

01:06:33.356 --> 01:06:34.857
REACTION TO WHICH WOULD SEVEN

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:36.058
HOW PORTENT THAT WAS --

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:37.593
ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.428
FINANCES LETTER COULD CONTINUING

01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:41.697
WITH FUNDING -- THE CLEAN

01:06:41.764 --> 01:06:42.865
VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT

01:06:42.932 --> 01:06:44.533
CONTINUOUSLY.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:45.768
IS A PRIORITY TO THE

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.937
ADMINISTRATION WHEN IT COMES TO

01:06:48.003 --> 01:06:50.306
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEAVY DUTY --

01:06:50.373 --> 01:06:51.941
VEHICLES IN OFF ROAD EQUIPMENT.

01:06:52.007 --> 01:06:53.743
IT NOT ONLY ISN'T SEEN AS A LONG

01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:55.311
TERM INVESTMENT BUT IS ACTUALLY

01:06:55.378 --> 01:06:58.047
PROPOSED TO BE DECREASED.

01:06:58.114 --> 01:06:59.815
UNLIKE THE REST PATTERSON TALKED

01:06:59.882 --> 01:07:01.984
ABOUT THE WHAT IS THE RATIONALE

01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:04.954
FOR THIS DISPARITY -- MY MY

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:07.123
UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PROGRAM

01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:08.958
SUCH AS HYBRIDS AND ZERO

01:07:09.024 --> 01:07:10.493
EMISSION TRUCK AND BUS VOUCHER

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:13.829
PROGRAM. TO THIS POINT HAS BEEN

01:07:13.896 --> 01:07:17.600
EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL.

01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:19.268
WELL AGAIN THE WE'VE GOT WE'VE

01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:20.803
GOT THE TWO HUNDRED THAT'S THE

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.405
ONGOING COMMITMENT AND THAT IS

01:07:22.471 --> 01:07:24.240
IN THE BUDGET FOR THIS FOR THE

01:07:24.306 --> 01:07:26.509
VOUCHER PROGRAM. FOR THE CLEAN

01:07:26.575 --> 01:07:27.910
VEHICLE VOUCHER PROGRAM.

01:07:27.977 --> 01:07:30.479
AND THE HEAVY DUTY AGAIN IT WAS

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:33.149
IT WAS A MATTER OF CRAFTING IT.

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:34.850
SO IT SOME OF IT WAS

01:07:34.917 --> 01:07:36.685
PROPORTIONATE.

01:07:36.752 --> 01:07:39.121
IN WHAT WE HAD REMAINING.

01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:41.490
AS FAR AS AFTER WE'VE TAKEN OUT

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:42.825
THE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:44.360
AFTER WE'VE TAKEN OUT OFF THE

01:07:44.427 --> 01:07:50.800
TOP AND THE ON GOING COMMITMENTS.

01:07:50.866 --> 01:07:52.735
I WANT IT I'M SORRY I AM SORRY

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:53.869
GO HEAD NO NO PLEASE

01:07:53.936 --> 01:07:54.170
[inaudible]

01:07:54.236 --> 01:07:57.373
STE.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:01.310
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL.

01:08:01.377 --> 01:08:03.078
ON THE ONES THAT WERE FUNDED FOR

01:08:03.145 --> 01:08:04.780
HEAVY DUTY [inaudible]

01:08:04.847 --> 01:08:07.616
AND THE AND THE OTHER

01:08:07.683 --> 01:08:09.485
TRANSPORTATION WITH THAT IS THE

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:13.322
HIGHEST AMOUNT OF THE G. H. G.

01:08:13.389 --> 01:08:16.425
AND THE AIR POLLUTANTS.

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:18.027
CONTRIBUTING TO TO HIGH AIR

01:08:18.093 --> 01:08:19.628
POLLUTANTS IS IN THE

01:08:19.695 --> 01:08:21.030
TRANSPORTATION FIELD.

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:22.498
SO IN ORDER TO GET THOSE NUMBERS

01:08:22.565 --> 01:08:24.467
DOWN IT ONLY MAKES SENSE TO DO

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:26.035
SOME INVESTMENT SENATE.

01:08:26.101 --> 01:08:29.338
BUT IF WE WERE TO SAY INCREASE

01:08:29.405 --> 01:08:32.741
THE HEAVY DUTY BACK UP.

01:08:32.808 --> 01:08:34.443
TO THE ONE EIGHTY THAT IN

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:37.213
CURRENT YEAR THEN WE WOULD NEED

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:38.747
TO FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO CUT

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:41.050
ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION.

01:08:41.116 --> 01:08:42.485
BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S I'M SORRY

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:44.854
THERE IS THAT THAT BALANCE BUT

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.022
IF THE LAR LET LA WAS CORRECT IN

01:08:47.089 --> 01:08:48.824
THAT THE THE ADJUSTMENTS DO HAVE

01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:51.627
TO BE MADE AND ANOTHER HUNDRED

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:52.862
MILLION COULD BE SPENT.

01:08:52.928 --> 01:08:55.130
AS WAS ANNOUNCED EARLIER.

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:58.067
ONCE THE BUDGET IS DONE IS DONE --

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:01.303
WE CAN SPEND MORE BECAUSE THE

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:03.606
THE THE MORE ACCURATE --

01:09:03.672 --> 01:09:06.575
ESTIMATES OF THE REVENUE OR WITH

01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:07.910
THE LA -- HAS SENT.

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.745
THEN WE DO HAVE THAT MONEY TO

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:12.181
OUT HERE OR DO WE NOT.

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:13.482
THEY'RE THEY'RE ALL ESTIMATED

01:09:13.549 --> 01:09:15.551
PROJECTIONS WE ARE COMING BACK

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:17.486
IN IN THE MAY REVISE WITH

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:19.455
UPDATED REVENUE PROJECTIONS.

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:21.257
AND THAT WILL HAVE THE BENEFIT

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:24.994
OF THE OF THE ESTIMATED REVENUE

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:25.694
THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY THE LA

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:28.430
L. NO THAT WOULD BE BASED ON ON

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:29.965
THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAD WITH

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:32.001
THE THE LATEST FEBRUARY AUCTION

01:09:32.067 --> 01:09:33.569
IN THAT CAME IN MUCH HIGHER THAN

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:35.971
ANTICIPATED FOR CURRENT YEAR.

01:09:36.038 --> 01:09:38.340
SO WE KNOW WERE WERE PROJECTING

01:09:38.407 --> 01:09:41.777
ADDITIONAL IN CURRENT YEAR.

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:43.379
AND THEN THAT WILL AFFECT WHAT'S

01:09:43.445 --> 01:09:45.814
IN BUDGET YEAR.

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:46.949
WONDERFUL.

01:09:47.016 --> 01:09:48.584
MISTER CHAIR IF I MAY.

01:09:48.651 --> 01:09:53.889
AB -- FIFTY FIFTY A 25%.

01:09:53.956 --> 01:09:56.025
INVESTMENT WAS WAS --

01:09:56.091 --> 01:09:57.860
RECOMMENDED I KNOW YOU'VE TALKED

01:09:57.927 --> 01:09:59.194
ABOUT THIS.

01:09:59.261 --> 01:10:01.931
WHICH OF THE IT WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:03.566
THE ENTIRE PORTFOLIO.

01:10:03.632 --> 01:10:05.868
WHICH OF THE PROGRAMS ARE

01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:08.270
FULFILLING THAT 25% WHICH OF THE

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:10.339
MOST SUCCESSFUL.

01:10:10.406 --> 01:10:14.743
I CAN GET I CAN GET A CHART TO

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:16.545
YOUR P. WHEN YOU'RE SAYING.

01:10:16.612 --> 01:10:18.681
THANK YOU -- AND THEN FINALLY IF

01:10:18.747 --> 01:10:22.384
I MAY MISTER CHAIR -- THIS YEAR

01:10:22.451 --> 01:10:23.986
I I AUTHORED.

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:25.621
AB FOURTEEN ELEVEN WHICH SETS A

01:10:25.688 --> 01:10:28.991
GOAL TO DEPLOY TWO HUNDRED

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:31.226
THOUSAND MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY --

01:10:31.293 --> 01:10:35.297
VEHICLES -- AND ALSO INCLUDING

01:10:35.364 --> 01:10:37.166
THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT

01:10:37.232 --> 01:10:37.967
THEM.

01:10:38.033 --> 01:10:39.335
AT THE BILL HIGHLIGHTS NEED FOR

01:10:39.401 --> 01:10:41.303
COMMUNITIES ACROSS ESPECIALLY

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:43.405
THE FREIGHT CORRIDORS. TO INVEST

01:10:43.472 --> 01:10:44.340
IN TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL CLEAN

01:10:44.406 --> 01:10:47.343
AIR QUALITY IN SOME OF THE MOST

01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:49.378
BURDENS COMMUNITIES.

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:50.579
OF IT SEEMS THAT WOULDN'T

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:51.447
WOULDN'T WE'RE TRYING TO

01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:53.582
DETERMINE THE GREENHOUSE GAS

01:10:53.649 --> 01:10:56.452
EMISSION FUND'S ALLOCATION

01:10:56.518 --> 01:10:58.354
THERE SEEMS TO BE THIS BACK AND

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.789
FORTH ON THE GOALS OF THE

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:01.991
PROGRAM.

01:11:02.057 --> 01:11:03.158
AND I THINK THERE WAS A COMMENT

01:11:03.225 --> 01:11:06.161
ABOUT THIS -- LOOKING TO

01:11:06.228 --> 01:11:07.463
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE.

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:08.998
GREENHOUSE GASES BUT ALSO

01:11:09.064 --> 01:11:10.366
PROTECTING THOSE VULNERABLE

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:12.668
COMMUNITIES -- ENSURING CLIMATE

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:16.138
EQUITY. FOR COMMUNITIES JUSTICE

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:17.506
OF MIGHT MY COLLEAGUES TALKED

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:19.274
ABOUT.

01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:21.076
THE COMMITTEES ARE MOST AFFECTED

01:11:21.143 --> 01:11:23.178
ARE THE POOREST AND THEY DO HAVE

01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:24.446
THE WORST AIR.

01:11:24.513 --> 01:11:27.349
AND THAT IS WHY THAT 25% IS SO

01:11:27.416 --> 01:11:29.685
IMPORTANT. TO US.

01:11:29.752 --> 01:11:31.654
I I THINK THAT WE CAN DO BOTH

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.188
AND FOR ME IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

01:11:33.255 --> 01:11:36.058
THAT WE SEE HOW WE FIND THAT

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:38.894
THAT BALANCE SO THAT THE POOREST

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:40.396
AND THE MOST VULNERABLE

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:41.363
COMMUNITIES.

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:42.531
ARE ALWAYS TAKEN INTO

01:11:42.598 --> 01:11:44.033
CONSIDERATION.

01:11:44.099 --> 01:11:45.167
AND PROVIDED THE FUNDING THAT'S

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:48.637
NEEDED -- WE KNOW THAT.

01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:49.571
CLIMATE CHANGE IS COMING

01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:51.306
ESPECIALLY.

01:11:51.373 --> 01:11:52.808
IT COMES TO ALL COMMUNITIES BUT

01:11:52.875 --> 01:11:54.309
THE POOREST ARE THE ONES THAT

01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:57.346
SUFFER THE MOST -- AND WE ARE

01:11:57.413 --> 01:11:58.347
WITHOUT A DOUBT

01:11:58.414 --> 01:12:01.550
DISPROPORTIONATELY MORE POLLUTED.

01:12:01.617 --> 01:12:03.886
BECAUSE AND THEN AS I MENTIONED

01:12:03.952 --> 01:12:05.187
EARLIER DIFFERENT COURT CORRIDOR.

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:07.556
I I AM JUST ASKING THAT AS WE

01:12:07.623 --> 01:12:09.124
LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS AS WE

01:12:09.191 --> 01:12:10.459
EVALUATE.

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:12.695
THOSE THAT DO BENEFIT THE

01:12:12.761 --> 01:12:15.097
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:17.199
NOT TO BE THE ONES THAT ARE ON

01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:19.034
THE CHOPPING BLOCK FIRST.

01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:21.737
AN ABSOLUTELY AND THAT WAS ONE

01:12:21.804 --> 01:12:24.273
OF THE FACTORS IN HOW THE PLAN

01:12:24.339 --> 01:12:25.808
WAS CRAFTED.

01:12:25.874 --> 01:12:27.810
SO WE'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO TARGET

01:12:27.876 --> 01:12:30.946
THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THE

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:32.948
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:35.050
THE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AS

01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:36.051
THE REPORT.

01:12:36.118 --> 01:12:37.686
THAT I HAD I HAD MENTIONED --

01:12:37.753 --> 01:12:39.855
THAT'S OUT.

01:12:39.922 --> 01:12:42.324
IT WE HAVE MET THOSE GOALS WHICH

01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:43.892
I'M VERY PROUD OF THE STATE FOR

01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:47.096
DOING AND AND IT'S BECAUSE OF

01:12:47.162 --> 01:12:48.630
THE ALLOCATIONS [inaudible]

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:50.232
THAT WERE.

01:12:50.299 --> 01:12:52.334
MORE PROJECTED AND I THINK THAT

01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:56.138
SOME OF THESE WILL CONTINUE THAT.

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:57.473
I WOULD AND I KNOW IT'LL BE --

01:12:57.539 --> 01:12:59.174
WE'LL DISCUSS IT LATER BUT

01:12:59.241 --> 01:13:01.410
MAKING SURE THAT AS WE TALK

01:13:01.477 --> 01:13:05.414
ABOUT THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES

01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:07.416
THE WE ALSO HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE --

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:08.684
WE DON'T WANT STRANDED ASSETS I

01:13:08.751 --> 01:13:10.819
RECOGNIZE THAT BUT WE ALSO HAVE

01:13:10.886 --> 01:13:12.321
TO PUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN IF

01:13:12.387 --> 01:13:13.956
WE WANT TO THE PEOPLE IN OUR

01:13:14.022 --> 01:13:16.058
COMMUNITY TO THEN INVEST.

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:18.227
IN THAT THE ZERO EMISSION

01:13:18.293 --> 01:13:20.629
VEHICLES AND FOR THE TRUCKS

01:13:20.696 --> 01:13:22.097
COMING THROUGH THE THE THE

01:13:22.164 --> 01:13:23.432
FREIGHT CORRIDOR IT'S VERY

01:13:23.499 --> 01:13:24.700
IMPORTANT THAT WE DO HAVE THAT

01:13:24.767 --> 01:13:27.703
INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT AS THEY

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:28.003
TRANSITION.

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:29.805
AND THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN GET

01:13:29.872 --> 01:13:30.906
THROUGH THE FREIGHT CORRIDOR

01:13:30.973 --> 01:13:31.673
WITHOUT LEAVING ALL OF THEIR

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.308
DIESEL IN OUR COMMUNITIES

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:33.609
[inaudible]

01:13:33.675 --> 01:13:36.278
THANK YOU.

YOU SAW A TRUCK TO TRUCK

01:15:12.507 --> 01:15:14.776
REPLACEMENT PROJECTS YOU SAW

MORE TOWARDS THAT COMMUNITY

01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:27.022
DEVELOPING GETTING THAT

01:15:27.089 --> 01:15:28.357
COMMUNITY INPUT SO YOU'RE

01:15:28.423 --> 01:15:29.958
STARTING TO SEE A LITTLE MORE

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:31.860
ZERO EMISSION SOME BUSES --

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:33.929
DELIVERY VEHICLES THOSE KINDS OF

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:37.165
THINGS -- BUT A BROAD SPECTRUM

01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:38.767
DEPENDING ON THE DISTRICT AND

01:15:38.834 --> 01:15:41.136
AND THE OTHER PROGRAM WAS.

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:43.171

PROGRAMS WHEN I WALKED AND SO

01:15:44.539 --> 01:15:45.807
SOME OF THE BUT IN THE END WITH

01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:47.376
REGARD TO THE AG PROGRAM THE

01:15:47.442 --> 01:15:49.077
FARMER PROGRAM THAT YOU'VE SET

01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:51.013
UP AGAIN STARTED VERY MUCH CARL

01:15:51.079 --> 01:15:51.980
MOYER LIKE.

01:15:52.047 --> 01:15:53.615
BUT WE'VE EXPANDED THE PROGRAM

01:15:53.682 --> 01:15:55.417
BEYOND THAT SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY

01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:57.419
HAS THE PREPONDERANCE OF THAT

01:15:57.486 --> 01:16:01.123
AND THEY HAVE GOTTEN -- EXPANDED

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:02.858
INTO MORROW WHEN YOU SAY CALL

01:16:02.925 --> 01:16:03.525
MORE LIKELY YOU'RE GOING TO TALK

01:16:03.592 --> 01:16:05.560
ABOUT I'M SORRY -- THE CARL

01:16:05.627 --> 01:16:06.895
MOYER PROGRAM IS -- INCENTIVE

01:16:06.962 --> 01:16:09.631
PROGRAM THAT WAS THE BASIS --

01:16:09.698 --> 01:16:11.366
IT'S IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR TWENTY

01:16:11.433 --> 01:16:12.267
YEARS AND IT'S BEEN THE WITH THE

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:14.002
START OF THE FOUNDATION FOR A

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:15.304
NUMBER OF THESE OTHER INCENTIVE

01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:16.672
PROGRAMS.

01:16:16.738 --> 01:16:20.976
SO WHEN -- THE LEGISLATURE --

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:22.611
ALLOCATED THAT MONEY THE LAST

01:16:22.678 --> 01:16:23.879
COUPLE OF YEARS THAT ALLOCATED

01:16:23.946 --> 01:16:26.214
AND SORT OF UNDER THAT FORMAT

01:16:26.281 --> 01:16:27.883
AND AND SO THE DISTRICTS HAVE

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:29.551
BEEN USED TO THAT AND THAT'S HOW

01:16:29.618 --> 01:16:31.553
THEY THE PROCESS AND PROCEDURES

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:33.155
THEY USED TO GET THAT FUNDING

01:16:33.221 --> 01:16:33.822
OUT.

01:16:33.889 --> 01:16:36.391
BUT IN THE FORMER PROGRAM THE AG

01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:38.093
WERE PROGRAM WE SEE A LOT OF

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.761
TRACTOR REPLACEMENT WE'RE

01:16:39.828 --> 01:16:42.864
STARTING TO SEE SOME -- ZERO

01:16:42.931 --> 01:16:51.273
MISSION -- AG U. T. V.'S -- AND

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:54.376
SOME -- YOU KNOW AG PUMPS A

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:54.876
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT --

01:16:54.943 --> 01:16:55.477
EQUIPMENT LIKE THAT TRUCK TO

01:16:55.544 --> 01:16:56.111
TRUCK REPLACEMENTS IN THE AG

01:16:56.178 --> 01:16:57.212
SECTOR BUT THE VAST MAJORITY IS

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:59.548
AG TRACTOR REPLACEMENTS RIGHT.

01:16:59.614 --> 01:17:00.182
IN IN IN PART OF ANY INCENTIVE

01:17:00.248 --> 01:17:00.849
PROGRAM OF THIS IS TO TRY TO GET

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:01.850
TO A TIPPING POINT WHERE THE

01:17:01.917 --> 01:17:02.851
INDUSTRY WHAT JUST NATURALLY

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:05.454
MOVE THAT WAY HOW HOW FAR AWAY

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:06.088
OR HOW CLOSE DO YOU THINK WE ARE

01:17:06.154 --> 01:17:07.789
TO THE WELL THAT DEPENDS ON THE

01:17:07.856 --> 01:17:11.059
THE CATEGORY WHEN WE'RE TALKING --

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:14.396
THE THE TRACTOR REPLACEMENT

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:16.531
THAT'S A VERY CHALLENGING AREA

01:17:16.598 --> 01:17:20.502
TO BE I MEAN FUNDAMENTALLY -- AG

01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:22.104
INDUSTRY WILL RUN THESE VEHICLES

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:25.240
UNTIL THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO LIFE

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:26.274
IN THEM AND THEN RUN THEM SOME

01:17:26.341 --> 01:17:27.042
MORE RIGHT.

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:29.211
AND AND SO REALLY THE INCENTIVE

01:17:29.277 --> 01:17:31.813
PROGRAM IS THE WAY TO TO JUST

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:34.349
DRIVE THAT REPLACEMENT WHAT

01:17:34.416 --> 01:17:36.018
WE'RE DOING AND OTHER PROGRAMS

01:17:36.084 --> 01:17:38.420
LIKE -- IN THE CLEAN TRUCK

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:40.222
PROGRAM WHERE WE'RE ACTUALLY

01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:41.857
BUILDING A MARKET FOR ZERO

01:17:41.923 --> 01:17:43.892
MISSION AND THOSE VEHICLES HAVE

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:46.328
A LOWER COST OF DOING BUSINESS

01:17:46.395 --> 01:17:48.263
OVER THEIR LIFE WE'RE STARTING

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:52.100
TO SEE -- THE BUSINESSES -- YOU

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:55.737
PS FRITO LAY OTHERS GO AND SAY I

01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:57.039
I CAN ACTUALLY MAKE A BUSINESS

01:17:57.105 --> 01:18:00.609
CASE FOR THIS AND SO WE DO SEE --

01:18:00.675 --> 01:18:05.013
PATHWAY THERE FOR THOSE OF

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.314
TAKING OFF ON THEIR OWN.

01:18:06.381 --> 01:18:07.249
IT IN IT'S IT'S IT'S BEEN A LOT

01:18:07.315 --> 01:18:08.183
OF DISCUSSION REGARDING FREIGHT

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:09.851
AND AND PASSENGER VEHICLES WE WE

01:18:09.918 --> 01:18:12.888
KNOW THAT -- TRANSPORTATION.

01:18:12.954 --> 01:18:15.257
COVERS ABOUT 40% OF GREENHOUSE

01:18:15.323 --> 01:18:16.425
GAS EMISSIONS WHAT'S THE

01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:20.195
BREAKDOWN WITHIN THAT. 40% OF

01:18:20.262 --> 01:18:21.530
PASSENGER VEHICLES VERSUS RIGHT --

01:18:21.596 --> 01:18:23.398
I DON'T HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME

01:18:23.465 --> 01:18:25.600
AS PRIMARILY -- THOUGH -- IT'S

01:18:25.667 --> 01:18:28.336
DRIVEN MORE BY LIGHT DUTY BUT I

01:18:28.403 --> 01:18:30.072
WE CAN GET YOU THAT INFORMATION.

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:31.606
DID YOU HAVE ANY BROUGHT.

01:18:31.673 --> 01:18:33.775
GAS.

01:18:33.842 --> 01:18:35.877
I'D I DON'T OKAY.

01:18:35.944 --> 01:18:39.281
MY MY MY LATEST -- START

01:18:39.347 --> 01:18:40.582
ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING.

01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:43.051
I THINK OF WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:44.119
TWENTY SIXTEEN NUMBERS ON

01:18:44.186 --> 01:18:46.354
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS -- THAT --

01:18:46.421 --> 01:18:48.390
HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES REPRESENTED

01:18:48.457 --> 01:18:50.659
ABOUT 22% OVERALL TRANSPORTATION

01:18:50.725 --> 01:18:52.394
EMISSIONS AND 9% OF OVERALL

01:18:52.461 --> 01:18:53.728
EMISSIONS GOT AS HE IS EVEN IF

01:18:53.795 --> 01:18:54.729
YOU'RE IN.

01:18:54.796 --> 01:18:56.064
A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY WHICH

01:18:56.131 --> 01:18:57.365
IS PRIMARILY DISADVANTAGE

01:18:57.432 --> 01:19:00.469
BECAUSE THEY'RE PROBABLY NEXT TO

01:19:00.535 --> 01:19:03.472
A FREEWAY -- ON AVERAGE -- USE

01:19:03.538 --> 01:19:05.207
GOING TO BE EVEN EVEN THE

01:19:05.273 --> 01:19:06.675
LEGISLATURE NEXT TO THE PORT OF

01:19:06.741 --> 01:19:09.211
LA OR THE OAKLAND PORT.

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:14.382
CHANCES ARE YOU GONNA BE ROUGHLY --

01:19:14.449 --> 01:19:15.717
SHARING THE SAME SIZE THE SAME

01:19:15.784 --> 01:19:16.718
KIND OF PERCENTAGE IS THAT IS

01:19:16.785 --> 01:19:19.421
THAT FAIR OR NOT FAIR.

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:20.555
I I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:19:20.622 --> 01:19:22.023
THEY'RE DISTRICTS LOCALLY HOW

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:23.058
THEY BREAK THAT DOWN WHEN THEY

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:23.859
WELL I I THINK WHAT YOU'LL WHAT

01:19:23.925 --> 01:19:30.232
WE'VE FOUND -- VERY CLEARLY IF

01:19:30.298 --> 01:19:31.333
AND SO -- PARTICULATE MATTER

01:19:31.399 --> 01:19:32.134
FROM THE TRUCKS IS A HUGE

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:33.235
CONSIDERATION FOR THE

01:19:33.301 --> 01:19:35.003
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- SO

01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:36.538
WE DO HAVE -- DIFFERENT

01:19:36.605 --> 01:19:38.773
COMMUNITIES REGIONALLY WE CARE A

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:40.408
LOT ABOUT THE KNOX EMISSIONS ARE

01:19:40.475 --> 01:19:42.310
TO LEAD TO OZONE -- SO WE DO

01:19:42.377 --> 01:19:44.312
LOOK AT ALL OF THESE WHEN WE'RE

01:19:44.379 --> 01:19:47.782
DESIGNING OUR PROGRAMS.

01:19:47.849 --> 01:19:49.050
THIS IS SO YOU WOULD YOU WOULD

01:19:49.117 --> 01:19:50.919
LOOK AT SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES.

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:53.088
AND BASED ON THE POLLUTANTS YOU

01:19:53.155 --> 01:19:54.089
WOULD.

01:19:54.156 --> 01:19:56.625
DESIGN PROGRAMS DIFFERENTLY I'M

01:19:56.691 --> 01:19:57.526
SOLUTIONS ARE JUST TELL ME ARE

01:19:57.592 --> 01:19:58.126
AND WE WE CERTAINLY MIGHT WE

01:19:58.193 --> 01:20:04.733
MIGHT TARGET FOR EXAMPLE -- A AT

01:20:04.799 --> 01:20:07.602
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY OR ONE

01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:09.671
THAT'S VERY -- A COMMUNITY THAT

01:20:09.738 --> 01:20:10.939
HAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:12.607
ROADWAY TRAFFIC TO CARE MORE

01:20:12.674 --> 01:20:15.710
ABOUT -- DRIVING THAT TO ZERO

01:20:15.777 --> 01:20:16.912
MISSION WE MIGHT DESIGN A

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:18.413
MOBILITY PROGRAM VERY

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.348
DIFFERENTLY WHICH HASDIFFERENT

01:20:20.415 --> 01:20:21.716
ATTRIBUTES A CAR SHARE PROGRAM

01:20:21.783 --> 01:20:23.185
MIGHT.

01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:28.190
MIGHT BE VERY -- DESIGN FOR A

01:20:28.256 --> 01:20:30.959
DIFFERENT TYPE OF COMMUNITY.

01:20:31.026 --> 01:20:32.093
THAT THE FOR SAY LIKE FREIGHT IN

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.628
PARTICULAR YOU HAVE THE FREIGHT

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:34.696
MAY IT MAY START AT A PARTICULAR

01:20:34.763 --> 01:20:35.664
PLACE BUT IT'S DRIVING ALL LET'S

01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:36.865
SAY ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE HOW

01:20:36.932 --> 01:20:39.067
DO YOU KNOW WHERE.

01:20:39.134 --> 01:20:39.668
WHERE THEY'RE GOING AND WHERE

01:20:39.734 --> 01:20:40.569
THEY'RE POLLUTING AND WE HAVE A

01:20:40.635 --> 01:20:43.138
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SO

01:20:43.205 --> 01:20:46.341
WHEN WE HAVE OUR -- OUR REBATE

01:20:46.408 --> 01:20:48.476
PROGRAM IT IS A FIRST COME FIRST

01:20:48.543 --> 01:20:50.478
SERVE AND AND THAT WILL SERVE

01:20:50.545 --> 01:20:52.881
WHOEVER COMES IN THE DORM

01:20:52.948 --> 01:20:53.915
PROVIDED MISSION BENEFITS AS YOU

01:20:53.982 --> 01:20:55.584
SAY EVERYWHERE WHEN WE HAVE

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:56.952
CERTAIN PILOT PROGRAMS WE MAY

01:20:57.018 --> 01:20:58.653
TARGET THOSE TO CERTAIN REGIONS

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:01.323
LIKE THE PORTS OR OTHERS WHERE

01:21:01.389 --> 01:21:01.590
WE WANT.

01:21:01.656 --> 01:21:04.292
TO FOCUS -- AND AND GET

01:21:04.359 --> 01:21:06.695
ADDITIONAL EMISSION REDUCTIONS

01:21:06.761 --> 01:21:11.900
IN CERTAIN REGIONS -- BUT

01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:15.270
REGARDING THE THE BREAKDOWN FOR

01:21:15.337 --> 01:21:16.004
FUNDING FOR DISADVANTAGED

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:16.771
COMMUNITIES GIVE A SENSE OF

01:21:16.838 --> 01:21:18.907
REGIONALLY HOW IT BREAKS DOWN.

01:21:18.974 --> 01:21:19.541
WHETHER IT'S BETWEEN NORTH SOUTH

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:23.912
INLAND.

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:25.113
I THINK IT'S A BROADER QUESTION

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:26.648
THERE BE.

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.149
YEAH AND I I BELIEVE THAT THE

01:21:28.216 --> 01:21:31.019
THAT ON THE WEBSITE. FOR THE

01:21:31.086 --> 01:21:32.854
ANNUAL REPORT THERE ARE SOME

01:21:32.921 --> 01:21:34.689
MAPS AND IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY

01:21:34.756 --> 01:21:36.591
COOL BECAUSE YOU CAN.

01:21:36.658 --> 01:21:39.294
YOU CAN SORT THE MAP BY REGION

01:21:39.361 --> 01:21:41.763
YOU CAN SORT OF BY DIFFERENT --

01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:44.132
DIFFERENT CRITERIA.

01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:46.501
AS FAR AS WHAT PROGRAMS WERE

01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:47.202
LOCATED IN IN WHAT.

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:49.838
WHAT AREAS OF THE STATE SO SO

01:21:49.904 --> 01:21:50.939
WHAT ONE OF OUR ONGOING CONCERNS

01:21:51.006 --> 01:21:52.340
FROM THE FROM THE BAY AREA IS

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:53.541
THAT ARE DISADVANTAGED MUSE HAVE

01:21:53.608 --> 01:21:54.809
BEEN PENALIZED?

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:56.444
BY THE CALLIN VIRUS SCREEN AND

01:21:56.511 --> 01:22:00.048
AND THE CONCERN IS THAT --

01:22:00.115 --> 01:22:01.583
BECAUSE FRANKLY THERE THE REGION

01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:02.117
HAS BEEN A LEADER IN THE

01:22:02.183 --> 01:22:03.685
ENVIRONMENTAL AREA HAS DONE A

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:05.220
LOT OF WORK IN THIS THAT.

01:22:05.287 --> 01:22:06.721
MUCH OF THE WORK THAT OUR OUR

01:22:06.788 --> 01:22:08.757
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES HAVE DONE IN

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:10.592
PURSUIT AND FRANKLY OUR COMPANY

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:11.126
TO PURSUE WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:22:11.192 --> 01:22:11.626
PENALIZED.

01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:13.662
AND BECAUSE OF THAT THAT WERE AT

01:22:13.728 --> 01:22:17.098
RISK OF NOT GETTING -- ONGOING

01:22:17.165 --> 01:22:20.869

02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:25.570
POINT CAN WE ANTICIPATE TO STOP

02:12:25.637 --> 02:12:26.938
PAYING FOR IMPLEMENTATION COSTS.

02:12:27.005 --> 02:12:27.806
THE STATE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE

02:12:27.873 --> 02:12:28.740
A ROLE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

THAT FOR THE ZERO EMISSION

02:17:34.946 --> 02:17:36.214
MARKET I THINK THERE'S IS NO

02:17:36.281 --> 02:17:37.515
LONGER A QUESTION OF IF IT'S

02:17:37.582 --> 02:17:38.583

02:18:13.785 --> 02:18:15.086
CRITICAL THAT WE GET THIS.

02:18:15.153 --> 02:18:16.554
THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT.

ACROSS ALL OF OUR PROCEEDINGS

02:27:41.986 --> 02:27:44.055
NOT JUST. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES

02:27:44.121 --> 02:27:46.657
AND WE DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN AND

02:27:46.724 --> 02:27:48.426
DIRECTING THE UTILITIES TO TRACK

02:27:48.492 --> 02:27:49.961
AND MONITOR THE IMPACT OF

02:27:50.027 --> 02:27:52.163
INCREMENTAL AB LOAD ON ON THE

TRACK ANY -- DISTRIBUTION GREAT

02:27:58.836 --> 02:28:00.905
UPGRADES NECESSARY -- TO DATE

02:28:00.972 --> 02:28:01.872
THEY HAVEN'T FACED ANY

02:28:01.939 --> 02:28:03.708
SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE

02:28:03.774 --> 02:28:06.811
UPGRADES SPECIFICALLY TARGETED.

02:28:06.877 --> 02:28:08.212
TO INCREMENTAL EVEY LOAD BUT WE

02:28:08.279 --> 02:28:10.982
EXPECT THAT THEY'LL START TO SEE --

02:28:11.048 --> 02:28:12.650
AS AS MORE EAGLES ARE ADOPTED

02:28:12.717 --> 02:28:13.884
THAT INCREMENTAL ET LOAD WILL

02:28:13.951 --> 02:28:16.020
ONLY GROW SO WHERE WE DIRECTED

02:28:16.087 --> 02:28:17.088
THEM TO CONTINUE MONITORING THAT

02:28:17.154 --> 02:28:19.857
BUT BEYOND THAT DIDN'T THERE'S

02:28:19.924 --> 02:28:20.691
NO.

02:28:20.758 --> 02:28:23.728
REAL OBVIOUS ACTION NEEDED AT

02:28:23.794 --> 02:28:24.528
THIS POINT.

02:28:24.595 --> 02:28:25.529
IN TERMS OF THE AUTONOMOUS

THAT WAS ADOPTED LAST YEAR IN SB.

02:28:35.006 --> 02:28:35.573
TEN FOURTEEN AND ALSO WITH THE

02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:37.575

ET INFRASTRUCTURE -- AS WAS JUST

02:28:39.910 --> 02:28:43.814
DISCUSSED UNDER AB -- TWENTY ONE

02:28:43.881 --> 02:28:45.383
TWENTY SEVEN ONE THING THAT WE

02:28:45.449 --> 02:28:47.084
WOULD NOTE IS THAT -- TO AVOID

02:28:47.151 --> 02:28:49.186
AGE ON GOING CONGESTION ISSUES

02:28:49.253 --> 02:28:51.389

DRIVERS OR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES

02:28:59.530 --> 02:29:00.798
TO AVOID TRAVELING WITH EMPTY

02:29:00.865 --> 02:29:02.633
VEHICLES -- SO WE'VE BEEN

02:29:02.700 --> 02:29:04.201
WORKING WITH ACADEMIC PARTNERS

02:29:04.268 --> 02:29:06.070
IN THIS DEEP CC TO STUDY THE

02:30:24.415 --> 02:30:25.649
OUR MAIN POINTS WE'D LIKE TO

02:30:25.716 --> 02:30:27.284
MAKE HERE IS IF THE LEGISLATURE

CONTINUE TO OPERATE THROUGH

02:30:41.999 --> 02:30:46.971
THEIR USEFUL LIFE RATHER THAN

02:31:07.224 --> 02:31:09.760
JUST REMEMBER -- FROM

02:31:09.827 --> 02:31:12.396
200-092-2017 VW SOLD ABOUT

02:31:12.463 --> 02:31:12.963
EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DIESEL

02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:14.365
VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAD

02:31:14.432 --> 02:31:15.866
DEFEAT DEVICES THAT WERE

02:31:15.933 --> 02:31:17.368
DESIGNED TO AVOID THE KNOX

02:31:17.435 --> 02:31:18.736
EMISSION CONTROL.

02:31:18.803 --> 02:31:20.671
SO AS A RESULT OF THIS AND A

02:31:20.738 --> 02:31:22.773
CONSENT DECREE GETTING CAUGHT IN

02:31:22.840 --> 02:31:23.441
A CONSENT DECREE.

02:31:23.507 --> 02:31:25.309
A VW WAS REQUIRED TO DO FOUR

02:31:25.376 --> 02:31:27.378
MAIN THINGS SO THE FIRST THING

02:31:27.445 --> 02:31:28.512
THEY HAD TO DO WAS THEY HAD.

02:31:28.579 --> 02:31:29.880
TO EITHER FIX THE VEHICLES ARE

02:31:29.947 --> 02:31:31.348
GET THEM OFF THE ROAD.

02:31:31.415 --> 02:31:33.050
THE SECOND THING IS THEY PAID A

02:31:33.117 --> 02:31:34.652
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE POINT

02:31:34.718 --> 02:31:36.187
EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR PENALTY.

02:31:36.253 --> 02:31:37.855
THE THIRD THING IS THEY HAD TO

02:31:37.922 --> 02:31:39.857
MAKE UP THE EXTRA NOT EMISSIONS

02:31:39.924 --> 02:31:41.692
SO THEY'VE PROVIDED FOUR HUNDRED

02:31:41.759 --> 02:31:43.127
AND TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS

02:31:43.194 --> 02:31:44.328
WHICH WE ARE ADMINISTERING

02:31:44.395 --> 02:31:45.930
CARBONS ADMINISTERING AND THIS

02:31:45.996 --> 02:31:49.166
IS SOMETIMES KNOWN AS APPENDIX

02:31:49.233 --> 02:31:50.301
D..

02:31:50.367 --> 02:31:51.135
AND THEN FINALLY THE REQUIRED TO

02:31:51.202 --> 02:31:52.102
INVEST EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION

02:31:52.169 --> 02:31:53.771
DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA TO SUPPORT

02:31:53.838 --> 02:31:55.372
THE INCREASED USE OF THAT IS AND

02:31:55.439 --> 02:31:56.273
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO TALK

02:31:56.340 --> 02:31:57.074
ABOUT TODAY THAT'S CALLED

02:31:57.141 --> 02:31:58.976
APPENDIX FEES SOMETIMES PEOPLE

02:31:59.043 --> 02:32:00.010
WILL CALL IT.

02:32:00.077 --> 02:32:02.046
SO VW IS IMPLEMENTING APPENDIX

02:32:02.112 --> 02:32:04.281
THE SEE THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARY

02:32:04.348 --> 02:32:06.217
ELECTRIFY AMERICA WE SOMETIMES

02:32:06.283 --> 02:32:07.685
CALL THAT EA.

02:32:07.751 --> 02:32:09.286
AND THIS INVESTMENT IS MADE IN

02:32:09.353 --> 02:32:10.888
FOUR CONSECUTIVE TWO HUNDRED

02:32:10.955 --> 02:32:13.357
MILLION DOLLAR THIRTY MONTH ZAB

02:32:13.424 --> 02:32:16.093
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN CYCLES.

02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:17.495
THERE ARE FOUR AREAS THAT YOU

02:32:19.396 --> 02:32:20.764
CONSENT DECREE.

02:32:20.831 --> 02:32:23.501
SO ONE OF THEM IS THAT

02:32:23.567 --> 02:32:25.336
INFRASTRUCTURE. ONE IS BRANDED

02:32:25.402 --> 02:32:26.937
NEUTRAL PUBLIC AWARENESS SO

02:32:27.004 --> 02:32:28.672
AWARENESS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES

02:32:28.739 --> 02:32:29.707
BUT NOT NECESSARILY ANY

02:32:29.773 --> 02:32:31.108
PARTICULAR BRAND.

02:32:31.175 --> 02:32:34.078
INCREASING ZAB ACCESS THROUGH

02:32:34.144 --> 02:32:34.645
THINGS LIKE RIDE AND DRIVE

02:32:34.712 --> 02:32:37.047
EVENTS AND THEN ALSO GREEN CITY

ESPECIALLY IN LOW INCOME AND

02:32:45.956 --> 02:32:47.258
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

02:32:47.324 --> 02:32:49.260
SO THE BOARD APPROVED ELECTRIFY

BUILDINGS THEY'RE DESIGNED FOR

02:34:31.662 --> 02:34:33.130
SORT OF ROUND TRIPS AND THEY'VE

02:34:33.197 --> 02:34:35.032
GOT ABOUT HALF OF THE SEVENTY

02:34:35.099 --> 02:34:36.333
ONE APARTMENT BUILDINGS --

HELPED A LOT.

02:34:53.117 --> 02:34:55.619
AND WE THINK THAT THE GUIDE BOOK

02:34:55.686 --> 02:34:57.888

02:36:13.397 --> 02:36:14.665
I ALSO WANT TO MENTION --

02:36:14.732 --> 02:36:16.200
EARLIER I SAID B. W. WAS

02:36:16.266 --> 02:36:17.968
REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FOUR HUNDRED

02:36:18.035 --> 02:36:19.203

TO FULLY MITIGATE THEIR KNOCKS

02:36:20.771 --> 02:36:21.739
EMISSIONS.

02:36:21.805 --> 02:36:23.273
UNDER THE SETTLEMENT MOST OF

02:36:23.340 --> 02:36:24.842
THAT MONEY IS GOING TO VEHICLE

02:36:24.908 --> 02:36:25.776
REPLACEMENT.

02:36:25.843 --> 02:36:27.778
BUT THAT PLAN ALSO INCLUDES TEN

02:36:27.845 --> 02:36:30.447
MILLION DOLLARS FOR LIGHT DUTY

02:36:30.514 --> 02:36:30.914
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE

02:36:30.981 --> 02:36:32.049
INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:36:32.116 --> 02:36:33.083
THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY

02:36:33.150 --> 02:36:35.119
MANAGEMENT DISTRICT IS MANAGING

02:36:35.185 --> 02:36:36.687
THAT PIECE OF IT FOR THE WHOLE

02:36:36.754 --> 02:36:37.588
STATE.

02:36:37.654 --> 02:36:39.757
WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE

02:36:39.823 --> 02:36:41.391
BAY AREA DISTRICT AND THE

ADMISSION STANDARDS VIOLATIONS --

02:36:55.639 --> 02:36:56.673
SO THE SCA SETTLEMENT IS

02:36:56.740 --> 02:36:58.375
STRUCTURED DIFFERENTLY FROM THE

02:36:58.442 --> 02:36:59.710

ARE DEPOSITED INTO THE AIR

02:37:14.324 --> 02:37:15.726

THEY'LL BE MANAGED THROUGH THE

02:37:17.427 --> 02:37:19.396
NORMAL YOU KNOW BUDGET PROCESS

02:37:19.463 --> 02:37:20.798

02:43:15.819 --> 02:43:17.087
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND

02:43:17.154 --> 02:43:17.921
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE

02:43:17.988 --> 02:43:19.356
PREVIOUS ISSUE THERE ARE

02:43:19.422 --> 02:43:20.790
PROGRAMS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON

02:43:20.857 --> 02:43:22.192
KIND OF THE EQUITY COMPONENT IN

02:43:22.259 --> 02:43:24.394
TRYING TO PROVIDE MORE ACCESS

02:43:24.461 --> 02:43:25.829
AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS. FOR

02:43:25.896 --> 02:43:26.897
EXAMPLE THROUGH THE LOW CARBON

02:43:26.963 --> 02:43:27.898
FUEL STANDARD TO BE ABLE TO

02:43:27.964 --> 02:43:30.634
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDS AS WELL

02:43:30.700 --> 02:43:33.170
ON TO THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS.

02:43:33.236 --> 02:43:35.205
IN AND I SAY IT JOKINGLY BUT

02:43:35.272 --> 02:43:36.206
IT'S REALLY NOT A JOKE I FEEL

02:43:36.273 --> 02:43:37.007
SOMETHING'S GOT TO BE LIKE OPRAH

02:43:37.073 --> 02:43:39.209
WINFREY AND SAY LIKE YOU GET A

02:43:39.276 --> 02:43:39.676
HEART YOU GET A HOT.

02:43:39.743 --> 02:43:41.011
SO WHEN I TALK TO THE CAR

02:43:41.077 --> 02:43:42.045
DEALERS IN MY DISTRICT THAT TELL

02:43:42.112 --> 02:43:43.013
ME WELL FOLKS IN YOUR COMMUNITY

02:43:43.079 --> 02:43:44.014
ARE COMING IN AND IT MIGHT BE

02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:45.348
CASH BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF

02:43:45.415 --> 02:43:46.583
INSTABILITY OR THEIR EMIGRANTS

02:43:46.650 --> 02:43:47.918
AND EVEN MORE SO NOW WITH THIS

02:43:47.984 --> 02:43:48.652
ADMINISTRATION.

02:43:48.718 --> 02:43:50.854
SO THEY WANT TO SPEND BETWEEN

02:43:50.921 --> 02:43:51.454
THREE TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:43:51.521 --> 02:43:52.289
THAT I WANT TO HAVE.

02:43:52.355 --> 02:43:53.723
BEEN SECURITY OF A PAYMENT IF

02:43:53.790 --> 02:43:55.926
THERE'S A FAMILY EMERGENCY AND

02:43:55.992 --> 02:44:01.198
SO A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR.

02:44:01.264 --> 02:44:02.399
PROGRAM IS A LOT OF MONEY BUT IT

02:44:02.465 --> 02:44:02.999
STILL DOESN'T GET THEM TO THE

02:44:03.066 --> 02:44:03.667
POINT WHERE THEY PENCILS AND FOR

02:44:03.733 --> 02:44:05.035
THEM TO BUY THESE CARS WE DON'T

02:44:05.101 --> 02:44:06.069
HAVE ENOUGH USE CARS ON THE

02:44:06.136 --> 02:44:06.836
MARKET OUT THERE AS WELL.

02:44:06.903 --> 02:44:08.171
PART OF IT IS THAT COMPANIES ARE

02:44:08.238 --> 02:44:09.839
TAKING THE BACK SO WE CAN LEARN

02:44:09.906 --> 02:44:11.641
FROM THEM AND AND THAT'S FAIR --

02:44:11.708 --> 02:44:13.677
IN IN THAT BERRIER BUT WHEN I'M

02:44:13.743 --> 02:44:15.445
TALKING TO MY DAUGHTERS ARE LIKE

02:44:15.512 --> 02:44:16.913
THEY CAN'T I'M SORRY I TALK TOO

MUCH UNTIL BLUE IN THE FACE

02:44:18.048 --> 02:44:18.448
ABOUT THESE.

02:44:18.515 --> 02:44:19.616
THESE PROGRAMS BUT THEY'RE NOT

02:44:19.683 --> 02:44:22.352
WILLING TO TO DO IT OR NOT ONLY

02:44:22.419 --> 02:44:23.687
TO DO AT LEAST -- BECAUSE THAT

02:44:23.753 --> 02:44:24.754
STILL VERY AFFORDABLE SO IT'S

02:44:24.821 --> 02:44:26.590
TRYING TO MEET THEM WHERE THEY

02:44:26.656 --> 02:44:28.558
ARE AT ON AND SO IT'S I ALMOST

02:44:28.625 --> 02:44:29.459
TO THE POINT OF HOW DO I MAKE A

02:44:29.526 --> 02:44:31.261
CAR BE BETWEEN THREE TO FIVE

02:44:31.328 --> 02:44:33.230
THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH MAKES ME

02:44:33.296 --> 02:44:34.130
LIKE OPRAH WINFREY SAID ONLY BUT

02:44:34.197 --> 02:44:35.765
I DO THINK WE NEED. TO START

02:44:35.832 --> 02:44:36.233
THINKING AND AND THOSE

02:44:36.299 --> 02:44:40.737
DIRECTIONS AS TO TALK ABOUT

02:44:40.804 --> 02:44:43.306
EQUITY.

02:44:43.373 --> 02:44:45.342
THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR --

02:44:45.408 --> 02:44:48.144
IN JUST A FAULT WITH MY FROM MY

02:44:48.211 --> 02:44:49.145
COLLEAGUE FROM BELL'S COMMENTS I

02:44:49.212 --> 02:44:50.146
I THINK -- WE'RE NOW AT A POINT

02:44:50.213 --> 02:44:52.415
WHERE THERE IS A USED CAR MARKET

02:44:52.482 --> 02:44:53.016
THERE ARE SOME USED CARS THAT

02:44:53.083 --> 02:44:54.784
ARE CHEAP -- IN THAT PRICE RANGE

02:44:54.851 --> 02:44:55.919
BUT THEY HAVE LIMITED RANGE

02:44:55.986 --> 02:44:57.654
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A PAIR AYE THE

02:44:57.721 --> 02:45:00.490
CONCERN SO -- WE DEFINITELY NEED

02:45:00.557 --> 02:45:02.425
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE

02:45:02.492 --> 02:45:05.262
USED CARS BACK INTO COMMUNITIES

02:45:05.328 --> 02:45:06.529
BECAUSE ARE DIFFERENT COMMUNITY

02:45:06.596 --> 02:45:07.631
THAT'S ALL THEY BY IS USED CARS

02:45:07.697 --> 02:45:08.832
THAT'S THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN

02:45:08.898 --> 02:45:10.900
NEW CARS THEY DON'T THEY DON'T

02:45:10.967 --> 02:45:13.870
FIND A VERY -- COST EFFECTIVE.

02:45:13.937 --> 02:45:19.276
IN IN THAT IN THAT WAY -- AND SO

02:45:19.342 --> 02:45:20.543
I THINK THAT THE LINKING GOT UP

02:45:20.610 --> 02:45:22.812
ALSO -- DEAF TELLING WITH HER

02:45:22.879 --> 02:45:24.614

THIS WHAT IS THE STRATEGY IN THE

02:45:27.417 --> 02:45:28.652
COMMUNITY.

02:45:28.718 --> 02:45:31.154

TAPPED OUT BECAUSE 65% OF OUR

02:45:41.398 --> 02:45:43.133
COMMUNITY ARE TENANTS.

02:45:43.199 --> 02:45:44.567
IN SO -- THERE THAT'S YOU KNOW

02:45:44.634 --> 02:45:46.469

02:49:27.690 --> 02:49:29.025
PEOPLE ON A DAILY BASIS AND SO

02:49:29.092 --> 02:49:29.926
THERE ARE THOUSANDS AND

02:49:29.993 --> 02:49:31.861
THOUSANDS MORE LIKE YOU THAT

02:49:31.928 --> 02:49:33.730
HAVE THEM IN THEIR HOMES THOSE

02:49:33.796 --> 02:49:35.298
ARE ALSO NOT INCLUDED IN THE

02:49:35.365 --> 02:49:39.135
COUNTS GOT IT OKAY.

02:49:39.202 --> 02:49:40.904
SO -- YEAH I THINK WHAT WOULD BE

02:49:40.970 --> 02:49:41.571
HELPFUL IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.

02:49:41.638 --> 02:49:42.539
WHAT?

02:49:42.605 --> 02:49:43.373
SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ABOUT

02:49:43.439 --> 02:49:45.441
HOW.

02:49:45.508 --> 02:49:46.109
TO HOW TO HOW TO BRIDGE THAT GAP

02:49:46.175 --> 02:49:46.943
IS IT.

02:49:47.010 --> 02:49:49.579
IS IT ALL PUBLIC FUNDING IS

02:49:49.646 --> 02:49:51.147
THERE A WAY TO DO IT WHERE IT'S

02:49:51.214 --> 02:49:53.583
PUBLIC PRIVATE HOW HOW DO WE

02:49:53.650 --> 02:49:55.018
KNOW HOW TO HOW DO WE BRIDGE

02:49:55.084 --> 02:49:56.586
THAT GAP BECAUSE I THINK THAT.

02:49:56.653 --> 02:49:59.255
THE GAP -- PLAYS A HUGE ROLE IN

02:49:59.322 --> 02:50:01.791
PEOPLE NOT ADOPTING BECAUSE ONCE

02:50:01.858 --> 02:50:03.459
THEY GET THEIR STAR SO STRESSED

02:50:03.526 --> 02:50:04.460
HERE NOT NO STRESS ABOUT WOULD

02:50:04.527 --> 02:50:05.828
LIKE TO GET GAS RIGHT THEY CAN

02:50:05.895 --> 02:50:07.564
GET GAS EVERYWHERE THERE'S A

02:50:07.630 --> 02:50:07.864
CONFIDENCE.

02:50:07.931 --> 02:50:09.933
BUT IF YOU'RE A COMMUNITY.

02:50:09.999 --> 02:50:12.635
YOU MAY NOT HAVE A GARAGE IF YOU

02:50:12.702 --> 02:50:13.303
DON'T HAVE YOUR OWN GARAGE READY

02:50:13.369 --> 02:50:15.471
OR GIVE A CARPORT OR YOU YOU

02:50:15.538 --> 02:50:17.140
LIVE IN A APARTMENT COMPLEX.

02:50:17.206 --> 02:50:18.908
YOU CAN INSTALL A CHARGE OR OR

02:50:18.975 --> 02:50:20.243
FOR US A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR

02:50:20.310 --> 02:50:21.244
COMMUNITIES THEY BUILD THE

02:50:21.311 --> 02:50:24.213
GARAGES OUT SO THEY THEY CHARGE

02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:25.782
THEIR CARS ON THE NOT ON THIS

02:50:25.848 --> 02:50:27.250
SORT OF IN THEIR DRIVEWAY.

02:50:27.317 --> 02:50:29.819
SO -- GET GIVEN THOSE TYPES OF

02:50:29.886 --> 02:50:31.588
SITUATIONS WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO

02:50:31.654 --> 02:50:33.056
SORT OF BUILD OUT THAT

02:50:33.122 --> 02:50:34.390
INFRASTRUCTURE TO REALLY TALK

02:50:34.457 --> 02:50:35.692
THIS IS TRUE THIS IS A GREAT

02:50:35.758 --> 02:50:37.060
QUESTION WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD

02:50:37.126 --> 02:50:38.728
NEWS BAD NEWS SITUATION THE GOOD

02:50:38.795 --> 02:50:40.330
NEWS IS WE HAVE OVER HALF A

02:50:40.396 --> 02:50:40.897
MILLION.

02:50:40.964 --> 02:50:41.564
CELEBS IN THE STATE OF

02:50:41.631 --> 02:50:43.166
CALIFORNIA I THINK IF YOU WOULD

02:50:43.232 --> 02:50:44.334
PREFER THAT TEN OR TWENTY YEARS

02:50:44.400 --> 02:50:45.568
AGO PEOPLE WOULD HAVE PROBABLY

02:50:45.635 --> 02:50:46.836
CHUCKLE.

02:50:46.903 --> 02:50:49.105
THE BAD NEWS IS WE HAVE FIVE

02:50:49.172 --> 02:50:49.772
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THE US IN

02:50:49.839 --> 02:50:52.008
CALIFORNIA -- AND WE'RE TRYING

02:50:52.075 --> 02:50:52.809
TO CATCH UP WITH THE

02:50:52.875 --> 02:50:54.978
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO WE SEE IT

02:50:55.044 --> 02:50:56.813
AS A AS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE

02:50:56.879 --> 02:50:57.780
TO TO MEET THESE GOALS SO.

02:50:57.847 --> 02:50:59.582
AS YOU KNOW AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY

02:50:59.649 --> 02:51:00.216
SEVEN DIRECTS US TO LOOK INTO

02:51:00.283 --> 02:51:01.684
THIS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR

02:51:01.751 --> 02:51:02.518
COLLEAGUES AT THE AIRPORT IN THE

02:51:02.585 --> 02:51:03.753
PC.

02:51:03.820 --> 02:51:05.855
AND WE STARTED THAT ANALYSIS

02:51:05.922 --> 02:51:06.856
ALREADY IN TO WE'RE GONNA BE

02:51:06.923 --> 02:51:08.157
REALLY DIVING INTO THOSE

02:51:08.224 --> 02:51:09.025
QUESTIONS WELL IN AND AND

02:51:09.092 --> 02:51:10.226
HOPEFULLY YOUR GAP ANALYSIS IS

02:51:10.293 --> 02:51:12.095
NOT LOOKING AT THE FIVE HUNDRED

02:51:12.161 --> 02:51:12.695
FIFTY THOUSAND BETWEEN LOOK AT

02:51:12.762 --> 02:51:14.097
THE FIVE MILLION BUT IT IS.

02:51:14.163 --> 02:51:15.198
RIGHT SO IT IS SO WE TOOK IT WE

02:51:15.264 --> 02:51:16.899
WE WE'VE BEEN PLANNING AGAIN

02:51:16.966 --> 02:51:19.302
SORT OF THE SNAPSHOT IN TIME OF

02:51:19.369 --> 02:51:20.970
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND ONE POINT.

02:51:21.037 --> 02:51:24.641
FIVE MILLION -- BUT YES WE WE

02:51:24.707 --> 02:51:25.742
APPRECIATE THAT THE BILL AS IT

02:51:25.808 --> 02:51:27.176
SHOULD BE THE LAW AS WELL AS

02:51:27.243 --> 02:51:29.479
COMMON SENSE SUGGESTS THAT'S

02:51:29.545 --> 02:51:30.113
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND IF THINGS

02:51:30.179 --> 02:51:31.414
CONTINUE TO MOVE THOSE NUMBERS

02:51:31.481 --> 02:51:32.749
WILL GROW IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:51:32.815 --> 02:51:39.355
NEEDS TO SUPPORT LARGER NUMBERS.

02:51:39.422 --> 02:51:41.324
IN IN TERMS OF THE SORT OF WHERE

02:51:41.391 --> 02:51:42.225
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING

02:51:42.291 --> 02:51:43.826
BETWEEN THE THREE I USE BETWEEN

02:51:43.893 --> 02:51:45.128
PW BETWEEN AND RG.

02:51:45.194 --> 02:51:46.195
IS IT BECAUSE IT THEIR BORDERS

02:51:46.262 --> 02:51:47.697
AND ENERGY COMMISSION WHO'S.

02:51:47.764 --> 02:51:49.565
WHO WHO'S SORT OF?

02:51:49.632 --> 02:51:50.166

WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE LIKE YOU

02:51:51.801 --> 02:51:52.902
KNOW FIVE FAST CHARGERS IN ONE

02:51:52.969 --> 02:51:53.836
PLACE AND NO FAST CHARGES IN

02:51:53.903 --> 02:51:54.637
THIS PLACE.

02:51:54.704 --> 02:51:55.838
I KNOW ALL UP UNTIL RECENTLY

02:51:55.905 --> 02:51:57.607
THERE NO FAST CHARGERS ALONG I

02:51:57.674 --> 02:51:59.375
FIVE WHICH IS WHY NO ONE NO NO

02:51:59.442 --> 02:52:00.543

DRIVE THEIR EVEY OR THERE WASN'T

02:52:02.745 --> 02:52:03.312
THAT I THINK IS ONLY A TEST LE

02:52:03.379 --> 02:52:04.514
FAST CHARGER.

02:52:04.580 --> 02:52:05.682
BUT PEOPLE DON'T DRIVE THREE

02:52:05.748 --> 02:52:06.282
BEES BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND

THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IS

02:53:29.165 --> 02:53:31.634
REALLY IMPORTANT -- ESPECIALLY

02:53:31.701 --> 02:53:34.737
IN THE THE FREE CORRIDORS FOR

02:53:34.804 --> 02:53:35.271
THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY

02:53:35.338 --> 02:53:36.372
VEHICLES.

02:53:36.439 --> 02:53:38.074
IT'S A BARRIERTO IT IF WE DON'T

TAKE CARE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:53:39.842 --> 02:53:40.576
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE

02:53:40.643 --> 02:53:41.277
VEHICLES THERE.

WHAT'S THE OVER ARCHING

02:53:46.282 --> 02:53:47.984
INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR THOSE

CHARGING FOR THE CHARGING

02:53:49.152 --> 02:53:51.154
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MEDIUM AND

TO AT THE THAT'S A DIFFICULT

02:53:58.594 --> 02:53:59.862
QUESTION TO ANSWER SO RIGHT NOW

02:53:59.929 --> 02:54:00.963
I THINK THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY

02:54:01.030 --> 02:54:02.331
DUTY MARKET IS REALLY EMERGING

02:54:02.398 --> 02:54:03.432
WE HAVE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT

02:54:03.499 --> 02:54:05.601
PROGRAMS LIKE THAT ZERO NEAR.

02:54:05.668 --> 02:54:06.569
ZERO FREIGHT IN ENERGY

02:54:06.636 --> 02:54:08.504
FACILITIES PROGRAM A. R. B. AS A

02:54:08.571 --> 02:54:09.906
GOOD EXAMPLE OF A BUNCH OF

02:54:09.972 --> 02:54:11.107
DIFFERENT PROJECTS GOING.

02:54:11.174 --> 02:54:12.608
THE IN ABOUT THAT HYDROGEN AND

02:54:12.675 --> 02:54:13.776
CHARGING AND THEN YOU HAVE THE

02:54:13.843 --> 02:54:15.411
UTILITIES INVESTING HEAVILY ON

02:54:15.478 --> 02:54:17.313
THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR

02:54:17.380 --> 02:54:18.781
IT YOU KNOW FOR BATTERY ELECTRIC

02:54:18.848 --> 02:54:21.150
VEHICLE DRIVE TRAIN SAID THIS

02:54:21.217 --> 02:54:22.518
ONE I THINK WORDS THAT MEAN

02:54:22.585 --> 02:54:24.287
HEAVY DUTIES IS.

02:54:24.353 --> 02:54:25.288
EMERGING RIGHT NOW SOARED AB.

02:54:25.354 --> 02:54:27.523
IN COORDINATION WORKING TOGETHER

02:54:27.590 --> 02:54:28.558
TO HELP SEE THOSE RIGHT NOW VOTE

02:54:28.624 --> 02:54:30.026
CATEGORIZE IT MOSTLY AT THE

02:54:30.092 --> 02:54:31.594
PILOT PHASE.

02:54:31.661 --> 02:54:35.031
AND THEN SCALE IS VERY CLOSE

02:54:35.097 --> 02:54:37.200
BEHIND.

02:54:37.266 --> 02:54:39.502
SO THE PIECE IS AUTHORIZED TO AT

02:54:39.569 --> 02:54:40.102
TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO

02:54:40.169 --> 02:54:40.636
INSTALL DC FAST CHARGING

02:54:40.703 --> 02:54:41.938
STATIONS ALONG TRANSIT QUARTERS.

02:54:42.004 --> 02:54:43.306
AND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION

02:54:43.372 --> 02:54:43.973
DOLLARS TO INSTALL

02:54:44.040 --> 02:54:46.075
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT MEDIUM

02:54:46.142 --> 02:54:47.643
AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE ACT FAKE

02:54:47.710 --> 02:54:50.046
ELECTRIFICATION OVERALL.

02:54:50.112 --> 02:54:54.550
THAT'S PC YEAH FOR THE I USE.

02:54:54.617 --> 02:54:55.518
THE QUESTION THAT ASSEMBLY

02:54:55.585 --> 02:54:57.153
MEMBER TING ASKED ABOUT WHO'S.

02:54:57.220 --> 02:54:58.721
WHO'S THE PLANNER FOR THIS.

02:54:58.788 --> 02:54:59.789
IT ALMOST BEGS THE QUESTION

02:54:59.856 --> 02:55:03.559
SHOULDN'T THERE BE -- A PLANNER

02:55:03.626 --> 02:55:05.428
FOR THIS INFRASTRUCTURE AND IF

02:55:05.494 --> 02:55:06.596
SO.

02:55:06.662 --> 02:55:07.930
WHAT WOULD BE THE RECOMMENDATION

02:55:07.997 --> 02:55:10.199
AS TO WHICH DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE

02:55:10.266 --> 02:55:12.001
THE DEPARTMENT?

02:55:12.068 --> 02:55:14.670
THAT OVERSEAS AT ALL.

02:55:14.737 --> 02:55:15.738
WELL I THINK IN A LOT OF WAYS

02:55:15.805 --> 02:55:17.306
THEY GO BAD AS HAS BEEN

02:55:17.373 --> 02:55:18.674
APPOINTED.

02:55:18.741 --> 02:55:20.076
TO BE THE COORDINATOR OF ALL

02:55:20.142 --> 02:55:21.611
THESE THINGS SO I THINK THAT --

02:55:21.677 --> 02:55:23.012
AS FAR AS MASTER PLAN THAT'S IT

02:55:23.079 --> 02:55:24.814
THAT'S MAYBE TOO FAR A STEP TOO

02:55:24.881 --> 02:55:25.514
FAR IT'S MORE OF A MASTER

02:55:25.581 --> 02:55:26.949
COORDINATOR IS MAKING SURE THAT

02:55:27.016 --> 02:55:28.618
WE'RE ALL MAKING DECISIONS IN

02:55:28.684 --> 02:55:29.285
TANDEM.

02:55:29.352 --> 02:55:30.853
GOING FORWARD TO REGULAR

02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:32.655
MEETINGS TO HELP FACILITY THAT

02:55:32.722 --> 02:55:33.289
AFFECTS.

02:55:33.356 --> 02:55:34.924
BOTH AT THE TOP AGENCY LEVEL AND

02:55:34.991 --> 02:55:37.193
THEN AT THE AT THE STAFF LEVEL

02:55:37.260 --> 02:55:38.995
AS WELL.

02:55:39.061 --> 02:55:40.263
LAST COMMENT.

02:55:40.329 --> 02:55:42.298

02:55:47.970 --> 02:55:49.906
WE'RE CREATING NEW LOCAL

02:55:49.972 --> 02:55:53.376
ECONOMIES -- MATTHEW HAMLET A

02:55:53.442 --> 02:55:55.278
YOUNG MAN WHO VERY WISE BEYOND

02:55:55.344 --> 02:55:56.812
HIS AGE.

02:55:56.879 --> 02:55:58.681
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT AND

02:55:58.748 --> 02:56:01.217
SO WE'RE BILL BUILDING THE

02:56:01.284 --> 02:56:01.884
SUPERSTRUCTURE.

02:56:01.951 --> 02:56:02.919
WE NEEDED IN OUR COMMUNITIES

02:56:02.985 --> 02:56:05.288
BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE FRENCH

02:56:05.354 --> 02:56:05.821
QUARTER.

02:56:05.888 --> 02:56:08.224
WE WANT THOSE DIESEL TRUCKS TO

02:56:08.291 --> 02:56:10.092
SWITCH OVER THEY'RE NOT GONNA DO

02:56:10.159 --> 02:56:11.560
IT UNLESS THEY KNOW THEY CAN

02:56:11.627 --> 02:56:12.762

PLANNER IS.

02:56:18.134 --> 02:56:20.169
COORDINATING I THINK IS.

02:56:20.236 --> 02:56:21.804
JUST NOT THE SAME THING I THINK

02:56:21.871 --> 02:56:24.240
HAVING A MASTER PLANNER WHO IS

02:56:24.307 --> 02:56:25.541
THE ONE THAT RECEIVES THE

02:56:25.608 --> 02:56:27.476
INFORMATION WHO CAN LOOK AT THE

02:56:27.543 --> 02:56:28.778
ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:56:28.844 --> 02:56:30.813

WE'RE NOT WONDERING WHO THE

02:56:42.758 --> 02:56:44.193
PLANNER IS.

02:56:44.260 --> 02:56:45.661
WILL KNOW WHO THE COORDINATORS I

02:56:45.728 --> 02:56:47.663
WANT TO KNOW WHO THE PLANNERS

TODAY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT --

02:57:04.046 --> 02:57:05.181
REGARDING THE STATE'S ROLE IN

02:57:05.247 --> 02:57:06.649
ADOPTING POLICIES FOR CHARGING

02:57:06.716 --> 02:57:08.317
INFRASTRUCTURE WE WOULD LIKE TO

02:57:08.384 --> 02:57:09.719
POINT OUT THE NEED FOR BALANCE

02:57:09.785 --> 02:57:10.853
AND UNDERSCORE THAT THE FOCUS

02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:12.722
SHOULD BE ON THE RAPID EXPANSION

02:57:12.788 --> 02:57:14.156
OF CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:57:14.223 --> 02:57:15.458

ARE CONSIDERING REGULATIONS

02:57:22.231 --> 02:57:23.666
WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE RETROFIT.

02:57:23.733 --> 02:57:25.134
OR MORE LIKELY THE REPLACEMENT

02:57:25.201 --> 02:57:27.003
OF EXISTING CHARGING STATIONS IN

02:57:27.069 --> 02:57:28.637
CALIFORNIA AND WHICH WOULD ADD

02:57:28.704 --> 02:57:30.206
COSTS TO FUTURE CHARGING

02:57:30.272 --> 02:57:32.208
STATIONS -- KELLY TO SEE IS

02:57:32.274 --> 02:57:33.275
CURRENTLY WORKING WITH BOTH

02:57:33.342 --> 02:57:35.544

02:57:35.611 --> 02:57:36.545
WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE

02:57:36.612 --> 02:57:38.481
CONSEQUENCES OF THE REGULATIONS

02:57:38.547 --> 02:57:40.116
AS CURRENTLY PROPOSED.

02:57:40.182 --> 02:57:41.617
AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED THE STATE

02:57:41.684 --> 02:57:43.586
UTILITIES AND OTHERS HAVE SPENT

02:57:43.652 --> 02:57:44.920
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS TO PUT IN

OUR CURRENT NETWORK OF CHARGING

02:57:46.322 --> 02:57:47.790
STATIONS AND REQUIRING THE

02:57:47.857 --> 02:57:49.325
REPLACEMENT A RETROFIT.

02:57:49.392 --> 02:57:51.293
OF THE STATIONS RISKS OURS OF

02:57:51.360 --> 02:57:52.828
AIR QUALITY CLIMATE AND PUBLIC

02:57:52.895 --> 02:57:54.397
HEALTH GOALS AND I JUST WANT TO

CPUC SAID THAT GRANDFATHERING

02:57:57.767 --> 02:57:59.502
REALLY SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY

02:57:59.568 --> 02:58:00.836
FOR THESE REGULATIONS.

02:58:00.903 --> 02:58:02.738

PROCESS SEES. TO ENSURE THE

02:58:07.243 --> 02:58:09.078
REGULATIONS WILL NOT HINDER OR

02:58:09.145 --> 02:58:10.880
REVERSE OUR PROGRESS TO ACHIEVE

02:58:10.946 --> 02:58:12.748
THE NEEDED LEVELS OF CHARGING

02:58:12.815 --> 02:58:15.284
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE

HIMSELF THE CALIFORNIA TRANSIT

02:58:20.189 --> 02:58:21.390
STATION JUST WANNA START MY

02:58:21.457 --> 02:58:23.893
COMMENTS BY THINKING FOLKS HERE

02:58:23.959 --> 02:58:25.094
FOLKS FROM THE C. Q. C. A. R. B.

02:58:25.161 --> 02:58:26.328
AND C. C..

02:58:26.395 --> 02:58:29.031
R. FOR ALL THEIR GREAT WORK ON

02:58:29.098 --> 02:58:31.000
TRANSPORTATION LIKE VACATION.

02:58:31.067 --> 02:58:32.268
I KNOW I'M FOR UNFORTUNATELY

02:58:32.334 --> 02:58:33.869
WHAT I WANT TO SAY THAT DESPITE

02:58:33.936 --> 02:58:34.837
ALL THE GREAT PROGRESS IN THE

02:58:34.904 --> 02:58:36.672
INVESTMENTS ARE BEING MADE --

02:58:36.739 --> 02:58:38.140
WERE STILL FALLING SHORT OF WHAT

02:58:38.207 --> 02:58:41.277
WE NEED TO ACTUALLY HIT SCALE I

02:58:41.343 --> 02:58:43.846
AND THERE'S A QUESTION WITHIN

02:58:43.913 --> 02:58:46.549
THE STAFF ANALYSIS -- OF WHETHER

02:58:46.615 --> 02:58:48.417
THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONTINUE

02:58:48.484 --> 02:58:50.586
OR RATHER -- AUGMENT THE

02:58:50.653 --> 02:58:52.455
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL INVEST

02:58:52.521 --> 02:58:53.689
IN LIGHT DUTY -- VEHICLE

02:58:53.756 --> 02:58:55.558
INFRASTRUCTURE BY ALSO INVESTING

02:58:55.624 --> 02:58:56.759
IN MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY

02:58:56.826 --> 02:58:58.594
INFRASTRUCTURE I WOULD SAY

02:58:58.661 --> 02:59:00.596
THAT'S AN UNEQUIVOCAL YES --

02:59:00.663 --> 02:59:01.864
FROM THE TRANSIT INDUSTRY SO WE

02:59:01.931 --> 02:59:03.365
GIVE YOU JUST SOME PERSPECTIVE

02:59:03.432 --> 02:59:04.567
ON THERE WAS MUCH DISCUSSION

02:59:04.633 --> 02:59:06.068
ABOUT THE CPC'S CONTINUED

02:59:06.135 --> 02:59:07.036
INVESTMENTS.

02:59:07.103 --> 02:59:08.571
IN MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY

02:59:08.637 --> 02:59:10.206
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE

02:59:10.272 --> 02:59:11.674
TRANSIT INDUSTRY THAT AMOUNTS TO

02:59:11.740 --> 02:59:13.509
A MINIMUM INVESTMENT OF ABOUT

02:59:13.576 --> 02:59:14.577
FIFTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION

02:59:14.643 --> 02:59:15.177
DOLLARS.

02:59:15.244 --> 02:59:17.179
THAT'S STATEWIDE AND THAT IS

02:59:17.246 --> 02:59:18.581
CURRENTLY ONE TIME.

02:59:18.647 --> 02:59:20.216
WE'VE GOT ABOUT TEN THOUSAND

02:59:20.282 --> 02:59:21.917
VEHICLES THAT NEED TO BE CHARGED --

02:59:21.984 --> 02:59:23.285
AND THAT AMOUNT OF FUNDING WILL

02:59:23.352 --> 02:59:25.087
JUST SIMPLY BE INADEQUATE FOR US

02:59:25.154 --> 02:59:26.388
TO GET THERE AND SO I DO THINK

02:59:26.455 --> 02:59:27.423
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A A

02:59:27.490 --> 02:59:28.657
CONTINUED FOCUS.

02:59:28.724 --> 02:59:33.028
FROM THE LEGISLATURE MAKING SURE

02:59:33.095 --> 02:59:33.562
THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES

02:59:33.629 --> 02:59:34.497
NECESSARY. TO MAKE THIS

02:59:34.563 --> 02:59:36.198
TRANSITION AND I DO THINK THAT

02:59:36.265 --> 02:59:37.233
IT CAN BE -- PINPOINT IN A FEW

02:59:37.299 --> 02:59:38.601
KEY AREAS -- LARGELY WITH

02:59:38.667 --> 02:59:40.703
TRANSIT AGENCIES AND BRINGING

02:59:40.769 --> 02:59:42.271
THEM TO SCALE WE'VE GOT A LOT OF

02:59:42.338 --> 02:59:43.472
AGENCIES ARE OPERATING ABOUT A

02:59:43.539 --> 02:59:45.274
DOZEN TRANSIT BUSES VERY FEW

02:59:45.341 --> 02:59:46.876
THAT ARE OPERATING ANYTHING MORE

02:59:46.942 --> 02:59:49.044
THAN THAT. FOR US ACTUALLY PROVE

02:59:49.111 --> 02:59:51.013
THAT THIS TRANSITION IS IS

02:59:51.080 --> 02:59:52.548
FEASIBLE AND IT'S A VIABLE WE

02:59:52.615 --> 02:59:54.283
DIDN'T MAKE SOME INVESTMENTS IN

02:59:54.350 --> 02:59:55.918
LARGE SCALE.

02:59:55.985 --> 02:59:57.953
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT HAS A A

02:59:58.020 --> 02:59:59.221
BENEFIT NOT ONLY ALLOWING THAT

02:59:59.288 --> 03:00:00.589
TRANSIT AGENCY TO MAKE THAT

03:00:00.656 --> 03:00:02.725
TRANSITION TO FULLY ELECTRIFIED

03:00:02.791 --> 03:00:03.659
THE LESSONS LEARNED THAT WILL

03:00:03.726 --> 03:00:05.594
COME FROM THAT CAN BE PORTED

03:00:05.661 --> 03:00:07.897
OVER INTO OTHER HEAVY DUTY

03:00:07.963 --> 03:00:10.099
APPLICATIONS SO AS A MEANS OF

03:00:10.166 --> 03:00:12.134
KIND OF FOLLOWING A ARBY'S LEAD.

03:00:12.201 --> 03:00:14.136
OF INVESTING IN TRANSIT AS A

TOTAL CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE

03:00:50.739 --> 03:00:51.273

STATION TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS

03:00:56.478 --> 03:00:58.080
WITHOUT OVERLY IMPACTING THE

US STAFF REPORT IS -- I THINK --

03:18:48.850 --> 03:18:50.285
BECAUSE ACTUALLY WHY WERE THOSE

03:18:50.351 --> 03:18:55.189
ANTICIPATED IN THE ORIGINAL --

03:18:55.256 --> 03:18:56.858
WELL WHEN WHEN -- YOU ORIGINALLY

03:18:56.924 --> 03:19:01.195
REQUESTED POSITIONS TWO YEARS

03:19:01.262 --> 03:19:06.501

THAT AGAIN.

03:19:08.202 --> 03:19:09.570
BACK TO TWO YEARS AGO WE OF THE

03:19:09.637 --> 03:19:10.405
COMMISSION AND STAKEHOLDERS WERE

03:19:10.471 --> 03:19:12.740
JUST STARTING TO BECOME FAMILIAR

03:19:12.807 --> 03:19:14.642
WITH WHAT IS INVOLVED IN

03:19:14.709 --> 03:19:16.377
DISTRIBUTION PLANNING -- IN

03:19:16.444 --> 03:19:19.314
PARTICULAR IT'S A NEW AREA AND

03:19:19.380 --> 03:19:20.748
AND THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM WAS

03:19:20.815 --> 03:19:21.916
NEVER.

03:19:21.983 --> 03:19:24.218
BUILT TO TAKE ON THOUSANDS OF

03:19:24.285 --> 03:19:28.022
ELECTRIC VEHICLES STORAGE SOLAR

03:19:28.089 --> 03:19:29.223
SO IT REALLY.

03:19:29.290 --> 03:19:30.458
AT THAT TIME IT WAS NOT

03:19:30.525 --> 03:19:32.827
ANTICIPATED THAT THE TYPE OF OF

03:19:32.894 --> 03:19:33.861
THE BEGINNING OF THE

03:19:33.928 --> 03:19:34.929
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM WHEN IT WAS

03:19:34.996 --> 03:19:36.364
BUILT IN FACT IT JUST NEVER WAS

03:19:36.431 --> 03:19:38.399
DESIGNED TO TO TO TAKE ON THAT

03:19:38.466 --> 03:19:41.436
KIND OF OF COMMUNICATIONS THAT

03:19:41.502 --> 03:19:42.437
ARE INVOLVED.

03:19:42.503 --> 03:19:45.106
WITH THESE SYSTEMS LOAD ETCETERA

03:19:45.173 --> 03:19:47.508
SO IT REALLY ENTAILS A LOT OF

03:19:47.575 --> 03:19:48.876
ENGINEERING ANALYSIS AND IT'S

03:19:48.943 --> 03:19:51.279
PRETTY COMPLEX TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:19:51.346 --> 03:19:53.915
SERVICES RELIABLE AND SAFE.

03:19:53.981 --> 03:19:56.918
AND COST EFFECTIVE AS WELL SO

03:19:56.984 --> 03:19:58.720
IT'S JUST THIS IS THIS IS A VERY

03:19:58.786 --> 03:20:00.188
NEW TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS

03:20:00.254 --> 03:20:02.423
UTILITIES WHAT THE UTILITIES

03:20:02.490 --> 03:20:03.057
COMPLAINING OTHER SYSTEMS FOR A

03:20:03.124 --> 03:20:04.158
LONG TIME BUT IN TERMS OF

03:20:04.225 --> 03:20:06.761

WHO WON IN A CONNECT TO THE

03:20:08.162 --> 03:20:10.832
SYSTEM NOW STORAGE PROVIDERS.

03:20:10.898 --> 03:20:13.735
AGAIN SOLAR -- ELECTRIC VEHICLES

03:20:13.801 --> 03:20:15.770
IT JUST IT REQUIRES A WHOLE NEW

03:20:15.837 --> 03:20:17.538
LEVEL OF PLANNING AND IT'S IT

03:20:17.605 --> 03:20:18.906
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.

THAT JUST HAVE AN IDEA OF THE

03:20:23.411 --> 03:20:26.781
IMPACT SO WE HAVE ABOUT -- EIGHT

03:20:26.848 --> 03:20:27.415

CONNECTED RIGHT NOW TO THE GRID

03:20:29.650 --> 03:20:31.419
AND THAT'S ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND

03:20:31.486 --> 03:20:33.721
MEGAWATTS OF DEMAND -- WE ALSO

03:20:33.788 --> 03:20:35.490
IF IT'S ESTIMATED WHEN WE HAVE

03:20:35.556 --> 03:20:36.924
THREE POINT NINE THREE POINT

03:20:36.991 --> 03:20:38.593
NINE MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLES

03:20:38.659 --> 03:20:40.695
INTER CONNECTED INTO THE TO THE

03:20:40.762 --> 03:20:42.096
DISTRIBUTION GRID THAT'S GOING

03:20:42.163 --> 03:20:45.299
TO BE ABOUT 5% OF CALIFORNIA'S

03:20:45.366 --> 03:20:47.101
