RAPING. HIS DAUGHTER. BUT MOST

00:37:43.861 --> 00:37:51.168
IMPORTANT. AS A SEXUAL ASSAULT

00:37:51.235 --> 00:37:53.904

NOT TRYING TO STALL THIS AS THE

00:38:59.537 --> 00:39:01.038
CHAIRED THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE

SOMEONE THAT GREW UP AND THAT'S-

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:22.460
IN A FAMILY WHERE THERE WAS

00:39:22.526 --> 00:39:26.597
ABUSE GOING ON. I KNOW HOW

00:39:26.664 --> 00:39:30.167
DEVASTATING THAT IS BUT I ALSO

00:39:30.234 --> 00:39:31.836
FIND IT APPALLING THAT I HAD DE

00:39:31.902 --> 00:39:35.372
ACE. COME TO ME AND TELL ME

00:39:35.439 --> 00:39:37.141
THAT I SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT

THIS BILL BECAUSE IT DOESN'T

00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:40.244
AFFECT BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE

00:39:40.311 --> 00:39:42.079
BECAUSE WE DON'T GET MARRIED IT

00:39:42.146 --> 00:39:43.981
IS MOSTLY GOING TO GO AFTER.

00:39:44.048 --> 00:39:47.384
WHITE MEN. THAT TO ME THAT'S

00:39:47.451 --> 00:39:52.556
RACES PERIOD SIMPLE LAST RACE.

00:39:52.623 --> 00:39:55.192
THAT'S WHAT BOTHERED ME. NOBODY

00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:58.062
EVER ASKED ME AS A SEXUAL

00:39:58.129 --> 00:40:01.132
ASSAULT VICTIM NOBODY S. B. FOR

00:40:01.198 --> 00:40:03.334

HIS. FAMILY MEMBER. IT'S

00:40:08.172 --> 00:40:09.940
PROBABLY THE HARDEST THING THAT

00:40:10.007 --> 00:40:13.410
ANYONE CAN DO. AND SO WHEN I

00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:15.980
HAVE SOMEONE LOOK BEFORE YOU

00:40:16.046 --> 00:40:18.249

OBTAINING FUTURE EMPLOYMENT AND

00:43:06.984 --> 00:43:09.653
STIGMA TO THE FAMILY. CURRENT

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.422
LAW ALLOWS THE COURT TO TAKE

THIS BILL WILL PREVENT THAT.

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.098
AND SO WHAT I WANTED TO DO WITH

00:43:21.165 --> 00:43:22.933
THE HAVE MORE DISCUSSION WHAT I

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.736
WANTED TO DO IS WHEN I ASKED A

00:43:25.803 --> 00:43:31.108

BEGINNING OF NEXT YEAR IF WE

00:46:12.803 --> 00:46:15.405
HAD TO. I MAKE THOSE CHANGES

00:46:15.472 --> 00:46:18.208
BECAUSE- WE CAN WE CAN START A

00:46:18.275 --> 00:46:21.411
