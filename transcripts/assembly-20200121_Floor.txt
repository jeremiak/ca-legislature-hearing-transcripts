HOUSE RESOLUTION SIXTY NINE BY SOME REMEMBER THE ROLE RELATIVE TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. MR ALONE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED OPEN ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU MATT AS CHAIR TODAY I BRING BEFORE YOU HR SIXTY NINE COMMEMORATING. THE FORTY SEVENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DECISION IN ROE V. WADE AFFIRMING EVERY WOMAN HAS THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO CONTROL HER OWN REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS AND WHETHER TO CONTINUE A PREGNANT PREGNANCY OR OBTAIN AN ABORTION. WELL THE WAY IT WAS A VICTORY FOR WOMEN TO OWN THEIR OWN BODIES AND LAID THE GROUNDWORK TO FURTHER REPRODUCTIVE AND SEXUAL HEALTH CARE POLICIES THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY. IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE ONE OF TWO STATES WHERE THIS RIGHT IS PROTECTED IN BOTH STATUTE AND OUR CONSTITUTION. HOUSE RESOLUTION SIXTY NINE SOLIDIFIES THE ASSEMBLY SUPPORT AND COMMITMENT TO PROTECT PERSONS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO DECIDE IF AND WHEN THEY BECOME APPARENT. EVEN WITH THESE PROTECTIONS THE RIGHT TO ACCESSIBLE XIN SAFELY AND LEGALLY IN THIS COUNTRY IS IN JEOPARDY AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SUPREME COURT CAN STILL NARAL THESE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. A PROTECTIONS GRANTED BY ROE V. WADE ARE AT THEIR HIGHEST RISK OF BEING OVERTURNED. AT ALL LEVELS WHEN WE CONSIDER POLICY ON WOMEN'S HEALTH WE ALLOW WOMEN. AND THEIR DOCTORS AND MEDICAL EXPERTS TO COLLECTIVELY MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THEIR OWN BODY. ACCORDING TO A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY CONDUCTED BY PERRY AND DEM AMERICANS IN CALIFORNIANS OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORT ROE V. WADE DECISION WITH 72% OF AMERICANS SUPPORTING ACCESS TO ABORTION. IT IS VITAL FOR CALIFORNIA WHICH IS HOME TO NEARLY TWENTY MILLION WOMEN TO RECOGNIZE AND UPHOLD THESE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS ESPECIALLY DURING A TIME WHEN PROVIDERS OF REPRODUCTIVE AND SEXUAL HEALTH CARE LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD ARE UNDER SERIOUS UNRELENTING ATTACK FOR PROVIDING SAFE AND LEGAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. I LIKE MANY OF YOU STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF A WOMAN'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT AS CONFIRMED IN ROE V. WADE TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS REGARDING THEIR PREGNANCY AND URGE FOR AN AYE VOTE ON HR SIXTY NINE. THANK YOU MS LIMON. WE'RE GOING OUT OF HIS BARRICADE IN YOUR RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IS THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF HR SIXTY NINE ON THE EVE OF THE FORTY SEVENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HISTORIC DECISION OF ROE V. WADE ABORTION ACCESS HAS NEVER BEEN MORE AT RISK IN THIS COUNTRY. MY ENTIRE LIFE I HAVE BEEN PRIVILEGED BY THIS RIGHT TO PRIVACY. BUT TODAY IT IS AT RISK. CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF ENSURING A WOMAN HAS CHOICES WHEN IT COMES TO HER PERSONAL REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS AND HEALTH CARE. HOWEVER RIGHT NOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO GAG AND BAN AND REMOVAL CRUCIAL PATHWAYS FOR CARE FOR WOMEN. IN TWENTY NINETEEN ALONE OVER THREE HUNDRED BILLS WERE INTRODUCED IN WASHINGTON DC AND STATE HOUSES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AIMED AT ELIMINATING ACCESS TO SAFE LEGAL ABORTION SERVICES. IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US IN CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT AND SECURE OUR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN LIGHT OF THE CONTINUED ATTACKS. YOUR MIND IT JUST THIS WEEKEND AS I MARCHED WITH THOUSANDS OF OTHER WOMEN IN THE WOMEN'S MARCH THE POWER THAT WE HOLD TO MAKE CHANGE WHEN WE STAND TOGETHER. MY YOUNG DAUGHTER SAW A SIGN THAT SAID MY BODY MY CHOICE AND SHE SAID THAT'S RIGHT MOM MY BODY MY CHOICE AND TOGETHER WE MUST PROTECT OUR RIGHTS MOVING FORWARD. CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO BE AT THE FOR. FOR PROVIDING COPPER CIVICS BOOK COMPETENT INCOMPLETE CARE FOR WOMEN. IN THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SPACE. BECAUSE THEY ALL KNOW. REPRODUCTIVE CARE IS HEALTH CARE. WE ARE FORTUNATE pCARE CHAMPION THROUGHOUT EACH LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT OF CALIFORNIA. MANY OF WHOM ARE IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER COURAGE AND FOR THE TIMELINESS OF HR SIXTY NINE WHICH REAFFIRMS THAT EVERY WOMAN HAS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO CONTROL HER OWN REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. TAKING HIS DARK MEMBERS ASK YOU GIVE YOUR IS RESPECTFUL ATTENTION TO YOUR COLLEAGUES AS THEY ADDRESS THIS BODY MR BONTA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA FOR INTRODUCING HOUSE RESOLUTION SIXTY NINE TO COMMEMORATE THE FORTY SEVENTH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE VERSUS WADE. LAST YEAR OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ANTI ABORTION BILLS WERE PASSED IN NUMEROUS NUMEROUS STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THIS FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO THREATEN WOMEN'S ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES. I'M PROUD THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE LEADING THE WAY IN THE SPACE BY PASSING SOME OF THE MOST PRO CHOICE MEASURES OF ANY STATE. WE HAVE DOUBLED OUR INVESTMENT IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AND CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO SUPPORT LAWS THAT ENSURE THAT MEDICAL DECISIONS. ARE MADE BETWEEN A WOMAN AND HER FAMILY AND HER DOCTOR. POLITICIANS SHOULD NOT BE INTERFERING WITH THIS DEEPLY PERSONAL DECISION. LAST YEAR GOVERNOR NEWSOME AND THIS LEGISLATURE WORK TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO ABORTION SERVICES ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AN INCREASE-ACCESS TO BIRTH CONTROL THROUGH TELEHEALTH HOWEVER. MANY LOW INCOME WOMEN WOMEN OF COLOR CALIFORNIANS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES AND OTHER VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS STILL STRUGGLE. CALIFORNIA WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROTECT NOT BàN THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO NEED IT MOST. I'M PROUD TO STAND AS A LONG TIME ALLY FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON HR SIXTY NINE. THANK YOU MISTER BONTA IS AGUIAR-CURRY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. GOOD MORNING MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF HR IXTY NINE. ON THE EVE OF THE FORTY SEVENTH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE VERSUS WADE I CANNOT HELP BUT THINK ABOUT WHAT THE BANDS BEING CONSIDERED ACROSS THE COUNTRY MEAN FOR WOMEN. MEN AND THEIR FAMILIES. WHAT IS MOST THE CITY IS ABOUT THESE EFFORTS IS THE RESTRICTIONS ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE HIT WORKING FAMILIES THE HARDEST. DON'T FOOL YOURSELF INTO BELIEVING THAT THE WEALTHY DON'T EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS. THEY JUST DON'T HAVE TO COUNT ON OTHERS TO HELP MAKE THOSE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR FAMILY'S HEALTH AND FUTURE. THIS MEANS OF WOMEN OF COLOR LGBT Q. PEOPLE AND PEOPLE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE IMPACTED EVEN MORE. BECAUSE THEIR ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IS ALREADY A CHALLENGE. THANKFULLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE FOUGHT TO PASS A PROTECT LAWS THAT ENSURE SAFE LEGAL ABORTION AND ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES. OUR STATE HAS DOUBLED OUR INVESTMENT IN SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND WE CAN AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT YEAR AFTER YEAR TO ENSURE THAT THIS TREND. CONTINUES TO EXPAND AND NOT BANNED. I URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU MISS AGUIAR-CURRY MINS BOERNER HORVATH YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YES COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF H. R. SIXTY NINE. I AS YOU GUYS ALL KNOW I'M A FIERCE CHAMPION OF WOMEN'S EQUALITY AND WE KNOW IF WE DON'T GET TO DECIDE WHEN UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES AND WITH WHOM WE START A FAMILY WE WILL NEVER BE EQUAL SO I URGE AN AYE VOTE TODAY ON THIS REALLY IMPORTANT MEASURE TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP CALIFORNIA LEADING ON PROTECTING OUR RIGHT AND ACCESS TO WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS BOERNER HORVATH MISS WICKS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES. A YEAR AGO. ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V. WADE I STOOD IN FRONT OF YOU. MY FIRST FLOOR STATEMENT AS A NEWLY ELECTED ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I TOLD YOU MY STORY THE STORY OF MY ABORTION. AND HERE WE ARE A YEAR LATER. SINCE THEN FIFTY EIGHT ABORTION RESTRICTIONS HAVE BEEN PASSED ACROSS THIS COUNTRY IN SOME PLACES A NEAR COMPLETE. BAN ON ABORTION. ALABAMA TRIED TO BAN THE PROCEDURE ALMOST ENTIRELY LAST YEAR WHEN ITS GOVERNOR SIGNED A LAW. THAT COULD SLAP DOCTORS WITH UP TO NINETY NINE YEARS IN PRISON FOR PERFORMING AN ABORTIONEVEN IN THE CASE OF RAPE OR INCEST. A YEAR LATER HERE WE ARE AGAIN. OHIO GEORGIA KENTUCKY MISSISSIPPI MISSOURI AND LOUISIANA HAVE PASSED FEEL HEART BEAT LAWS BANNING ABORTIONS AT THE ONSET OF A FOETAL HEARTBEAT. THIS CAN OCCUR AS EARLY AS SIX WEEKS INTO PREGNANCY OFTEN WELL BEFORE WOMEN EVEN KNOW THEY'RE PREGNANT. LIKE ALABAMA THE MISSOURI LAW WOULD ALSO SEVERELY PENALIZED HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TRYING TO PROVIDE WOMEN WITH THE SERVICES OFTEN LIFE SERVING LIFESAVING THAT THEY DESERVE. A YEAR LATER HERE WE ARE AGAIN. AND IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS THE SUPREME COURT WILL HEAR ITS FIRST MAJOR ABORTION CASE SINCE PRESIDENT TRUMP APPOINTED TO CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES. THE OUTCOME COULD RESHAPE THE FUTURE OF ROE V. WADE AND ALL THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES GOVERNING ABORTION RIGHTS. WE CANNOT SIT BY AND WATCH THE INTEGRITY OF ROE V. WADE BE ERODED WE MUSTDO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO STAND STRONG IN SUPPORT OF EVERY WOMAN'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS. AND I ASK YOU TO STAND WITH ME TODAY AND SUPPORT HR SIXTY NINE. BY PRESSING THE GREEN BUTTON TODAY YOU ARE STANDING WITH WOMEN WHO LIKE ME HAVE MADE THIS TOUGH DECISION. BY PRESSING THE SCREEN BUTTON YOU ARE ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BE A BEACON OF HOPE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. I ASK THAT YOU STAY WITH ME AND MILLIONS OF WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND SUPPORT HR SIXTY NINE. THANK YOU MISTER X. MISTER MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS. I RISE TO SHARE AN ABORTION STORY OF MY pMY TWINS JEFFERSON AND MAGGIE AND WHEN MY WIFE WAS PREGNANT. YOU KNOW YOU WE WENT IN AND WE GOT THE OLDER SOUND VERY VERY EARLY ON. AND THEY SPOTTED A DEFECT. WITH ONE OF THE TWINS SPINA BIFIDA. SOMETHING THAT COULD CAUSE DETRIMENTAL HARM TO THE CHILD. SOMETHING THEY SAID THIS CHILD MAY NEVER WALK MAY NEVER CRAWL. MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO DO ANY OF THESE THINGS. BUT THE FIRST OPTION THAT WE WERE GIVEN WAS MR AD MRS MATHIS YOU KNOW WE CAN GO IN AND ABORT THAT ONE. AND YOU ALREADY HAVE ONE CHILD WITH DISABILITIES ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT ANOTHER. AND THAT'S A HARD CHOICE IN LIFE IS ALL ABOUT CHOICES AND ABOUT MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE FREEDOMS TO MAKE THOSE CHOICES. BUT AFTER PRAYER AND AFTER EVERYTHING WE DECIDED TO CHOOSE LIFE. IN CHOOSE OUR SON JEFFERSON WHO MANY OF YOU OF MATT ON THE FLOOR WHO WAS TOLD. HE NEVER EVEN BE ABLE TO CRAWL AND NOW HE RUNS INCLINES IS IN SCHOOL. AND I JUST COULDN'T THINK OF A MOMENT WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO GET AS HE CALLS IT DADDY CUDDLES. WITH MY SON AND SO WHAT WE THINK OF THESE THINGS IT IS ABOUT CHOICES AND HAVING US FREEDOM OF CHOICES BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT SOME FOLKS WOULD PREFER TO CHOOSE LIFE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS MISTER CHIU YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND I WANT TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM FACILITY ABOUT REMINDING US HOW IMPORTANT IS. THAT ALL AMERICANS HAVE A RIGHT TO CHOOSE. AS OPPOSED TO BEING TOLD WHAT THEIR OPTIONS ARE. REVIEW WAIT IS IMPORTANT PART AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE OF WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY BUT IT'S NOT EXAGGERATION. TO SAY THAT THIS DECISION IS ON THE LINE LIKE IT'S NEVER BEEN BEFORE THIS YEAR AND TWENTY TWENTY. AS WAS ALLUDED TO BY OUR COLLEAGUE FROM OAKLAND IN MARCH THE SUPREME COURT WILL HEAR ARGUMENTS IN JUNE MEDICAL SERVICES VERSUS G. THE FIRST MAJOR CHALLENGE TO ABORTION ACCESS SINCE JUSTICE KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION TO THE SUPREME COURT. THE CASE CONCERNED A LOUISIANA LAW THAT'S IDENTICAL TO A TEXAS LAW. THAT THE SUPREME COURT STRUCK DOWN JUST A MERE FOUR YEARS AGO. THE ONLY THING THAT'S CHANGED SINCE THAT DECISION AND TWENTY SIXTEEN IS A COMPOSITION OF THE COURT. THE STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER. IF THE SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS A pLONGER BE A SINGLE ABORTION PROVIDER IN THAT STATE. THE EFFECT OF WHICH IS THE SAME AS OUTLINED ABORTION ALTOGETHER AND THIS IS THE POINT FOR ANTI CHOICE FORCES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO ARE HOPING TO GOT ROVI WAY TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH- IT IS SIMPLY A RIGHT IN NAME ONLY. AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE ALL MAKERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO ARE ASKING THE COURTTO GO EVEN FARTHER. THIS MONTH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED ANTI CHOICE LAWMAKERS IN CONGRESS SIGNED ONTO AN AMICUS BRIEF URGING THE COURT TO RECONSIDER ROE. ON THIS FORTY SEVENTH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE WE NEED TO BE MORE VIGILANT THAN EVER. SUPPORT FOR THE SUPREME COURT CASE IS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH WITH 77% OF ALL AMERICANS SUPPORTING THIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL STAND UP TO GUARANTEE.
