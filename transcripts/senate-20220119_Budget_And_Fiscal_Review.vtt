PANDEMIC AND IT CONTINUES TO

00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:37.136

00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:45.878
CHALLENGES INCLUDING

AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR SHORTAGE

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:51.851
OF HOUSING IN GENERAL HAS BEEN

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:53.786
PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:56.389

AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE URGENT

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:02.528
CLIMATE CRISIS ISSUES. SUCH AS

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:04.597
WILD FIRES AND DROUGHT. AND THEN

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:06.666
AS WE'VE SEEN WELL IT IS BEEN

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:09.335
PRESENT. WE'VE SEEN IT

00:06:09.402 --> 00:06:11.437
EXACERBATED DURING THE PANDEMIC

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:14.173
B. MENTAL HEALTH. ISSUES OF MANY

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.876
PEOPLE. WHETHER DUE TO THE

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:19.312
ISOLATION OR OTHER REASONS AND

00:06:19.378 --> 00:06:21.581
THE NEED TO RESPOND WITH

00:06:21.647 --> 00:06:23.916
ADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

00:06:23.983 --> 00:06:26.252
. AND ALSO WHEN WE'RE IN A TIME

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:28.788
LIKE THIS WHERE WE HAVE SOME-

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:31.057
HIGHER THAN PROJECTED REVENUES

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:32.658

OUR EDUCATION FACILITIES AND

STRENGTHEN THAT INFRASTRUCTURE

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:44.537
AND OF COURSE WE ARE ALSO

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:46.405
LOOKING IN THIS AT THE FACT THAT

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:48.608
WE HAVE WORK FOR SHORTAGES IN

00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:52.378

OF CHILD CARE OR OTHER SERVICES

00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:01.020
AND SOME OF THEM BECAUSE WE'VE

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.456
HAD A SHORTAGE FOR YEARS WHETHER

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:05.558
IT'S A NURSING TEACHING MENTAL

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:08.561
HEALTH OR OTHER SOME OTHER.

00:07:08.628 --> 00:07:11.197
WORKFORCE CATEGORIES WHICH WE

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.466

00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:39.818
SURPLUS OF ABOUT. TWENTY NINE

00:28:39.884 --> 00:28:42.187
BILLION WHICH IS A BIT LARGER

00:28:42.253 --> 00:28:44.289
THAN- WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:28:44.355 --> 00:28:46.691
IDENTIFIED IN THE IN THE IN THE

00:28:46.758 --> 00:28:48.359
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOCUMENT OF.

00:28:48.426 --> 00:28:50.428
TWENTY ONE BILLION. I WOULD KNOW

00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:51.796
WHAT IT WAS THE TWENTY NINE

00:28:51.863 --> 00:28:53.331
BILLION IS. FAIRLY SIMILAR TO

00:28:53.398 --> 00:28:54.632
WHAT WE HAD ESTIMATED BACK IN

00:28:54.699 --> 00:28:56.201
OUR NOVEMBER OUTLOOK JUST TO

00:28:56.267 --> 00:28:59.104
KIND OF KEEP. THE NUMBERS IT- IT

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:00.605
FAMILIAR TO YOU- WE HAD

00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:02.340
ESTIMATED A THIRTY ONE BILLION

00:29:02.407 --> 00:29:04.909
DOLLAR. DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS

00:29:04.976 --> 00:29:07.312
NOW WE HAVE TO MEET THE GOVERNOR

00:29:07.378 --> 00:29:08.546
CAME TO ABOUT TWENTY NINE

00:29:08.613 --> 00:29:09.581
BILLION ALTHOUGH THEY IDENTIFIED

00:29:09.647 --> 00:29:12.517
TWENTY ONE BILLION. SO THE-

00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:14.185
BASICALLY WE HAVE I THINK I

00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:16.121
BELIEVE OUR OFFICES APPROACH THE

00:29:16.187 --> 00:29:17.722
ESTIMATION OF THE DISCRETIONARY

00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:20.692
SURPLUS VERY. SIMILAR WAY USING

00:29:20.758 --> 00:29:22.861
A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY. BUT WHERE

00:29:22.927 --> 00:29:26.064
WE DIFFER. IN THIS CASE IS THAT-

00:29:26.131 --> 00:29:28.366
ART YEAH THE ADMINISTRATION

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:31.102
TREATS SOME. SPENDING AGREEMENTS

00:29:31.169 --> 00:29:32.971
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BUT ARE NOT

00:29:33.037 --> 00:29:36.508
CURRENTLY ENACTED IN LIFE. AS

00:29:36.574 --> 00:29:37.742
PART OF THE STATE SPENDING BASE

00:29:37.809 --> 00:29:39.677
. WHERE IS WE TREAT THEM AS

00:29:39.744 --> 00:29:40.879
STILL DISCRETIONARY CHOICES OF

00:29:40.945 --> 00:29:43.481
THE LEGISLATURE ONE OF THE YOU

00:29:43.548 --> 00:29:45.016
KNOW ONE OF THE MAIN EXAMPLES

00:29:45.083 --> 00:29:46.184
WOULD BE THE THREE POINT FIVE

00:29:46.251 --> 00:29:48.920
BILLION- PROPOSED TRANSPORTATION

00:29:48.987 --> 00:29:50.788
INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE. THE

00:29:50.855 --> 00:29:51.789
ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH IS

00:29:51.856 --> 00:29:53.525
VERY REASONABLE IN OUR VIEW I

00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:54.893
MEAN IT REFLECTS THE- SOME

00:29:54.959 --> 00:29:56.394
AGREEMENTS THAT WERE MADE LAST

00:29:56.461 --> 00:29:58.696
YEAR BUT ULTIMATELY THOSE WERE

00:29:58.763 --> 00:30:01.533
NOT ENACTED INTO- BUDGET LAW.

00:30:01.599 --> 00:30:04.536
AND SO YOU KNOW WE DID REVIEW

00:30:04.602 --> 00:30:06.404
THAT IT'S STILL BEING ADDED A

00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:07.872
MATTER OF DISCRETION FOR THE

00:30:07.939 --> 00:30:09.140
LEGISLATURE SO IT'S REALLY NOT

00:30:09.207 --> 00:30:11.075
JUST IN A DIFFERENT HOUSE IN THE

00:30:11.142 --> 00:30:12.810
COUNTY IT REALLY REFLECTS A

00:30:12.877 --> 00:30:14.512
CONSCIOUS CHOICE ON OUR PART TO.

00:30:14.579 --> 00:30:18.149
DEFER TO YOUR AUTHORITY OVER

00:30:18.216 --> 00:30:20.218
APPROPRIATIONS AND SO. GIVE ME.

00:30:20.285 --> 00:30:23.354
I AM SO WELL YOU MAY GO IT

00:30:23.421 --> 00:30:24.889
DECIDED TO ADHERE TO THOSE

00:30:24.956 --> 00:30:26.624
AGREEMENTS AS THE GOVERNOR HAS

00:30:26.691 --> 00:30:29.194
REFLECTED IN HIS PROPOSAL-

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.628
BEFORE THE MONEY CAN BE SPENT IT

00:30:30.695 --> 00:30:32.096
WOULD STILL REQUIRE YOU MAKING

00:30:32.163 --> 00:30:33.264
AN APPROPRIATION AND SO WE

00:30:33.331 --> 00:30:36.868
DON'T. ASSUME THAT UP FRONT- SO

00:30:36.935 --> 00:30:38.203
WHEN YOU DO THAT THE DIFFERENCE

00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:40.205
IS THAT COMES UP TO TWENTY NINE

00:30:40.271 --> 00:30:42.106
BILLION IN A SURPLUS. WHERE IS

00:30:42.173 --> 00:30:43.141
THE ADMINISTRATION HAD TWENTY

00:30:43.208 --> 00:30:45.777
ONE BILLION. WHEN I TURN TO THAT

00:30:45.843 --> 00:30:48.713
FIGURE ON PAGE ONE HERE ARE THE

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.315
TOP ONE IS SHOWING HOW THE

00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:50.915
GOVERNOR WOULD ALLOCATE THAT

00:30:50.982 --> 00:30:53.718
SURPLUS. AND YOU CAN SEE HERE

00:30:53.785 --> 00:30:54.686
THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS THE

00:30:54.752 --> 00:30:57.021
LARGEST AMOUNT IN- ONE TIMER

00:30:57.088 --> 00:30:58.756
TEMPORARY PROGRAMMATIC SPENDING

00:30:58.823 --> 00:31:01.626
WE CONSIDERED TEMPORARY TO BE

00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:03.795
THREE YEARS OR LESS. ABOUT

00:31:03.861 --> 00:31:05.330
SEVENTEEN POINT THREE BILLION.

00:31:05.396 --> 00:31:08.032
HE HAS. PROPOSED SIX POINT TWO

00:31:08.099 --> 00:31:10.835
BILLION OR REVENUE REDUCTION.

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:12.637
AND THEN- HE'S PROPOSING THREE

00:31:12.704 --> 00:31:14.572
POINT ONE BILLION TO GO INTO THE

00:31:14.639 --> 00:31:16.207
STATE'S DISCRETIONARY RESERVE

00:31:16.274 --> 00:31:18.176
WHICH IS THE SPECIAL FUND FOR

00:31:18.243 --> 00:31:20.478
ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. THERE ARE

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:22.513
TWO BILLION IN ONGOING SPENDING

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.082
PROPOSALS WHICH WE ESTIMATE

00:31:24.148 --> 00:31:26.150
WOULD INCREASE TO ABOUT YOU KNOW

00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:27.785
TO MORE THAN FIVE BILLION

00:31:27.852 --> 00:31:29.520
THROUGH THE FORECAST TO RISE IN

00:31:29.587 --> 00:31:31.022
WHICH IS TWENTY TWENTY FIVE

00:31:31.089 --> 00:31:32.690
TWENTY SIX. AND THEN THERE'S

00:31:32.757 --> 00:31:33.725
FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION

00:31:33.791 --> 00:31:37.228
IN. DEBT REPAYMENT ON TOP OF THE

00:31:37.295 --> 00:31:38.997
FOUR BILLION IN DEBT REPAYMENT

00:31:39.063 --> 00:31:42.100
IS REQUIRED BY PROPOSITION TWO.

00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:44.535
I WILL ALSO JUST NOTE THAT THE

00:31:44.602 --> 00:31:46.871
PROPOSAL INCLUDES ALMOST TWENTY

00:31:46.938 --> 00:31:48.506
FIVE BILLION IN WHAT WE CALL

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:50.942
GENERAL PURPOSE RESERVES. THAT

00:31:51.009 --> 00:31:52.243
IS THE BUDGET STABILIZATION

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:55.079
ACCOUNT THE SAFETY NET RESERVE.

00:31:55.146 --> 00:31:58.149
AND THE S. F. B. U. R. SO THOSE

00:31:58.216 --> 00:32:00.952
ARE THE ONES WE COUNT WHEN WE

00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:02.887
REFER TO TWENTY FIVE BILLION.

00:32:02.954 --> 00:32:05.723
THE SECOND FIGURE BUT- HOW TO

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.892
START THE SECOND FIGURE ON ON

00:32:07.959 --> 00:32:10.828
THE PAGE IS- THE GOVERNOR'S

00:32:10.895 --> 00:32:13.398
PROPOSAL FOR SPENDING AND IN THE

00:32:13.464 --> 00:32:15.333
SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.769
FOR PROP NINETY EIGHT N. HERE

00:32:17.835 --> 00:32:18.703
PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF HIGHER

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.905
REVENUES WHICH RESULT IN A

00:32:20.972 --> 00:32:22.674
HIGHER MINIMUM GUARANTEE THERE'S

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.709
ALMOST EIGHTEEN BILLION IN-

00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:27.412
PROPOSED NEW SPENDING. AND SO

00:32:27.478 --> 00:32:29.580
EVEN AFTER COVERING A FIVE POINT

00:32:29.647 --> 00:32:32.917
3% COLA WHICH ISN'T ABOUT A FOUR

00:32:32.984 --> 00:32:34.819
BILLION DOLLAR COST THE GOVERNOR

00:32:34.886 --> 00:32:37.422
PROPOSES ALLOCATING ABOUT

00:32:37.488 --> 00:32:38.656
THIRTEEN BILLION IN RESOURCES

00:32:38.723 --> 00:32:39.957
THEY SHOWN IN THAT IN THAT

00:32:40.024 --> 00:32:41.659
FIGURE SEVEN BILLION FOR ONE

00:32:41.726 --> 00:32:44.262
TIME ACTIVITY THREE POINT FOUR

00:32:44.329 --> 00:32:45.330
BILLION FOR THE EXPANDED

00:32:45.396 --> 00:32:46.998
LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM

00:32:47.065 --> 00:32:50.201
WHICH WAS INITIATED IN THE

00:32:50.268 --> 00:32:51.269
TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO

00:32:51.336 --> 00:32:52.303
BUDGET. ONE POINT TWO BILLION IN

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:54.472
AN ADJUSTMENT FOR DISTRICT-

00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:55.673
BECAUSE OF THE STATEWIDE

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.542
DECLINING ENROLLMENT SITUATION

00:32:57.608 --> 00:32:58.943
BECAUSE THERE IS A JUDGMENT THE

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:01.446
GOVERNOR PROPOSES THAT- COSTS

00:33:01.512 --> 00:33:03.448
ABOUT ONE POINT TWO BILLION. AND

00:33:03.514 --> 00:33:05.116
THEN- ONE POINT THREE BILLION

00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:07.719
AND IN OTHER WORDS SEVERAL

00:33:07.785 --> 00:33:10.254
ONGOING INCREASES. AND THEN LIKE

00:33:10.321 --> 00:33:12.790
I REFERRED WITH THE BOOK YEAH

00:33:12.857 --> 00:33:13.925
DISCRETIONARY GENERAL PURPOSE

00:33:13.991 --> 00:33:16.427
RESERVES- THERE IS UNDER THE

00:33:16.494 --> 00:33:18.129
RULES OF PROPOSITION TWO THIRDS

00:33:18.196 --> 00:33:20.898
NOW- THE PROPOSAL REFLECTS THAT

00:33:20.965 --> 00:33:23.368
THERE IS NOW GOING TO BE A- PROP

00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:24.836
NINETY EIGHT RESERVE. ALMOST TEN

00:33:24.902 --> 00:33:27.372
BILLION WHICH IS THE HIGHEST

00:33:27.438 --> 00:33:30.475
IT'S BEEN- TODAY SO. THAT IS

00:33:30.541 --> 00:33:34.178
NOTABLE. MOVING TO PAGE TWO I

00:33:34.245 --> 00:33:36.013
WANTED TO GIVE A COUPLE OF

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.448
COMMENTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S

00:33:37.515 --> 00:33:38.349
APPROACH TO THE STATE

00:33:38.416 --> 00:33:40.785
APPROPRIATION PLAN ENTERED AGAIN

00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:41.753
LIMITED SOMETIMES REFERRED TO

00:33:41.819 --> 00:33:47.225
YOU. AND IT- YOU KNOW THE DEATH

00:33:47.291 --> 00:33:49.627
AT A HIGH LEVEL. AFFECTS HOW THE

00:33:49.694 --> 00:33:52.930
LEGISLATURE CAN USE REVENUES

00:33:52.997 --> 00:33:54.766
THAT EXCEED A CERTAIN THRESHOLD

00:33:54.832 --> 00:33:57.568
. AND WHETHER THIS STATE HAS

00:33:57.635 --> 00:34:00.271
REQUIREMENTS STEMMING FROM.

00:34:00.338 --> 00:34:02.206
EXCEEDING THE FELL FOR THE STATE

00:34:02.273 --> 00:34:04.509
APPROPRIATIONS WHEN IT IS A TWO

00:34:04.575 --> 00:34:06.644
YEAR CALCULATION AND SO FOR THE

00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:08.112
PRIOR YEAR IN THE CURRENT YEAR

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:11.115
SO TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND

00:34:11.182 --> 00:34:12.650
THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO

00:34:12.717 --> 00:34:13.851
BUDGES THE GOVERNOR REFLECTS

00:34:13.918 --> 00:34:15.319
THE STATE HAS THE STATE

00:34:15.386 --> 00:34:17.255
APPROPRIATIONS ARE OVER THAT

00:34:17.321 --> 00:34:19.924
LIMIT BY A COMBINED TWO POINT

00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:23.127
SIX BILLION. THE REQUIREMENT.

00:34:23.194 --> 00:34:24.962
WOULD BE MORE THAN THIS WE WOULD

00:34:25.029 --> 00:34:26.764
BE OVER THE LIMIT BY MORE THAN

00:34:26.831 --> 00:34:28.399
THIS EXCEPT THAT THE BUDGET.

00:34:28.466 --> 00:34:30.334
PROPOSAL INCLUDES ABOUT SIX

00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:31.302
POINT THREE BILLION AND

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:33.471
PROPOSALS THAT- MEETS OUR

00:34:33.538 --> 00:34:35.506
REQUIREMENTS THUS LOWERING.

00:34:35.573 --> 00:34:37.775
APPROPRIATIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT

00:34:37.842 --> 00:34:40.678
TO THE LIMIT BY THAT AMOUNT- NO

00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:42.380
NOTABLY THE GOVERNOR DID NOT

00:34:42.447 --> 00:34:44.816
INCLUDE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL FOR

00:34:44.882 --> 00:34:46.350
DEALING WITH THESE EXCESS

00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:48.586
REVENUES. AND INDICATES THAT THE

00:34:48.653 --> 00:34:50.288
ADMINISTRATION WILL COME BACK

00:34:50.354 --> 00:34:51.756
AND PUT FORWARD A PLAN AT THE

00:34:51.823 --> 00:34:53.925
MAY REVISION WE HAVE BETTER AND

00:34:53.991 --> 00:34:56.160
MORE UP TO DATE INFORMATION.

00:34:56.227 --> 00:34:59.964
THAT'S ONE APPROACH BUT WE

00:35:00.031 --> 00:35:01.299
ACTUALLY WOULD ENCOURAGE THE

00:35:01.365 --> 00:35:02.667
LEGISLATURE TO BEGIN THINKING

00:35:02.733 --> 00:35:04.235
ABOUT DEVELOPING A PLAN FOR

00:35:04.302 --> 00:35:05.736
MEETING THE FELL REQUIREMENT

00:35:05.803 --> 00:35:09.006
BEFORE ME. THE REASON FOR THIS

00:35:09.073 --> 00:35:10.741
IS THAT DELAYING THE FORMATION

00:35:10.808 --> 00:35:14.011
OF A PLAN. REALLY REDUCES

00:35:14.078 --> 00:35:16.781
LEGISLATIVE FLEXIBILITY SO FOR

00:35:16.848 --> 00:35:18.950
EXAMPLE IF THE REVENUES YOU KNOW

00:35:19.016 --> 00:35:20.384
WE'VE BEEN SEEING STRONG REVENUE

00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:23.020
TRENDS AS THE CHAIR NOTED AT THE

00:35:23.087 --> 00:35:24.689
BEGINNING OF THE OF THE HEARING

00:35:24.755 --> 00:35:25.823
WE'VE BEEN SEEING VERY STRONG

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:26.724
REVENUE TRENDS AND IF THAT

00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:29.427
CONTINUES AND THEY CONTINUE TO

00:35:29.494 --> 00:35:31.929
OUTPACE. OUR BUDGET ESTIMATES.

00:35:31.996 --> 00:35:33.998
AND THE LEGISLATURE PREFERRED TO

00:35:34.065 --> 00:35:36.467
ADDRESS A PORTION OF IT- SAL

00:35:36.534 --> 00:35:38.269
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE PRODUCED

00:35:38.336 --> 00:35:41.372
BY THAT- THROUGH LOWERING TAX

00:35:41.439 --> 00:35:44.075
REVENUES THEN EARLY ACTION WOULD

00:35:44.141 --> 00:35:46.143
BE BETTER THAN WAITING UNTIL MAY

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:47.545
MAY NOT EVEN REALLY BE FEASIBLE

00:35:47.612 --> 00:35:49.447
IF YOU WAIT UNTIL THAT POINT IN

00:35:49.514 --> 00:35:52.250
THE FISCAL YEAR. FOR THE CURRENT

00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:57.321
YEAR- FIREMAN'S UNDERSELL SO WE

00:35:57.388 --> 00:35:58.689
ENCOURAGE YOU TO BEGIN THINKING

00:35:58.756 --> 00:36:00.892
ABOUT IT SOONER THAN THAT- AND

00:36:00.958 --> 00:36:04.862
THEN AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO THE

00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:05.997

BELOW THE LIMIT BY THAT AMOUNT

00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:22.513
BUT ALSO I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT

THAT THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO

00:37:41.325 --> 00:37:43.160
REJECT. REALLY SHOULD THINK

00:37:43.227 --> 00:37:45.730
ABOUT REPLACING THOSE WITH OTHER

THESE LARGER AMOUNTS YOU JUST

00:38:09.053 --> 00:38:10.721
HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU

00:38:10.788 --> 00:38:12.690
CAN'T VARY TOO MUCH FROM THOSE

00:38:12.757 --> 00:38:15.459
LARGER AMOUNTS AND REMAINS-

00:38:15.526 --> 00:38:18.963

MOVE ON TO. THE THIRD PAGE ARE

00:38:26.303 --> 00:38:29.106
WE OFFERED SOME COMMENTS ON ON

00:38:29.173 --> 00:38:30.241

ARCHING REMARKS FIRST OF ALL

00:38:36.113 --> 00:38:38.416
OVERALL WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE

00:38:38.482 --> 00:38:40.151
MAY WANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT.

00:38:40.217 --> 00:38:41.886
THEN THE GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF

00:38:41.952 --> 00:38:46.057
LAST YEAR'S COMMITMENT- THAT- MY

00:38:46.123 --> 00:38:46.891
COLLEAGUE FROM FINANCE THIRTY

00:38:46.957 --> 00:38:49.260
MENTIONED. IT IT MAY BE

00:38:49.326 --> 00:38:50.795
APPROPRIATE TO DEDICATE SOME

00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:52.930
PORTION OF THE EARLY PART OF THE

00:38:52.997 --> 00:38:54.165
BUDGET PROCESS THIS YEAR TO

00:38:54.231 --> 00:38:56.300
CHECKING END ESSENTIALLY ON HOW

00:38:56.367 --> 00:38:58.469
THAT IS GOING HOW IS THE

00:38:58.536 --> 00:38:59.637
IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE CHOICES

00:38:59.704 --> 00:39:01.305
GOING. OUT WITH THE ROLLOUT OF

00:39:01.372 --> 00:39:03.741
THE FUNDING WORKING AND SORT OF

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:05.576
PERFORM PERFORMING BASICALLY

00:39:05.643 --> 00:39:08.446
SOME AMOUNT OF AN OVERSIGHT

00:39:08.512 --> 00:39:10.448
FUNCTION IN THAT PROCESS.

00:39:10.514 --> 00:39:12.183
RELATED LINKS WE WOULD RECOMMEND

00:39:12.249 --> 00:39:14.051
THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUE TO

00:39:14.118 --> 00:39:15.586
BE CAUTIOUS THEN ABOUT CREATING

00:39:15.653 --> 00:39:19.056
NEW OR SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED-

00:39:19.123 --> 00:39:21.859
EXISTING PROGRAMS- UST BEARING

00:39:21.926 --> 00:39:23.494
IN MIND THAT STATE OVERALL

00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:25.796
CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT THESE. NEW

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:29.500
INITIATIVES. BANDANNAS THE

00:39:29.567 --> 00:39:31.736
OVERALL COMMENT I WOULD JUST SAY

00:39:31.802 --> 00:39:34.004
THAT WE DO THINK IT'S

00:39:34.071 --> 00:39:37.475
APPROPRIATE FOR- THE RECOGNITION

00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:40.244
ESSENTIALLY THAT THE PANDEMIC IS

00:39:40.311 --> 00:39:41.879
STARTING TO APPEAR LIKE IT COULD

00:39:41.946 --> 00:39:44.215
BE AN ONGOING OVER A LONGER TERM

00:39:44.281 --> 00:39:46.083
ISSUE FOR US ALL TO DEAL WITH.

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:49.286
AND YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE MAY

00:39:49.353 --> 00:39:50.755
WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE EXTENT

00:39:50.821 --> 00:39:51.956
TO WHICH THE GOVERNOR'S

00:39:52.022 --> 00:39:53.324
PROPOSALS RECOGNIZE THIS REALITY

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:55.726
AND YOU MAY HAVE- SOME

00:39:55.793 --> 00:39:58.295
IMPORTANT- PREFERENCES TO TAKE

00:39:58.362 --> 00:40:01.665
INTO ACCOUNT- AS YOU AS YOU KNOW

00:40:01.732 --> 00:40:06.737
THINK ABOUT. THAT- PROSPECT- ON

00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:09.140
THE NEXT TWO PAGES FOUR AND FIVE

00:40:09.206 --> 00:40:12.209
I THINK I WILL- JUST.

00:40:12.276 --> 00:40:15.379
ESSENTIALLY POINT OUT TO YOU

00:40:15.446 --> 00:40:16.714
WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS. A LIST OF

00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:17.915
SEVERAL OF THE MAJOR PROPOSALS

00:40:17.982 --> 00:40:19.583
FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND SOME OF

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:22.253
OUR INITIAL CONTENT- UNDERNEATH

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:23.788
THEM I WILL NOT GO THROUGH ALL

00:40:23.854 --> 00:40:25.256
OF THEM THEY'RE KIND OF IN

00:40:25.322 --> 00:40:26.624
KEEPING WITH THE THEMES THAT I

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:27.792
JUST MENTIONED. BUT IN THE

00:40:27.858 --> 00:40:29.894
INTEREST OF TIME I WILL I JUST

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.061
WON'T GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM

00:40:31.128 --> 00:40:32.830
WHAT I WILL SAY LIKE FOR EXAMPLE

00:40:32.897 --> 00:40:34.999
THIS DID THAT TAKE ONE EXAMPLE

00:40:35.065 --> 00:40:36.300
INDICATED FOURTEEN. AREA THE

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:37.968
SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:40:38.035 --> 00:40:40.604
ARE CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING- MANY

00:40:40.671 --> 00:40:43.440
NEWPROGRAMS AND REQUIREMENTS.

00:40:43.507 --> 00:40:45.209
IN THE MIDST OF- THE ONGOING

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:46.644
DISRUPTIONS CAUSED BY THE

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:48.612
PANDEMIC AND THEIR CAPACITY TO

00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:50.614
IMPLEMENT MORE NEW PROGRAMS IS

00:40:50.681 --> 00:40:53.250
LIKELY LIMITED SO WE KIND OF HAD

00:40:53.317 --> 00:40:56.821
THAT OVER ALL.CONTENT RECOMMEND

00:40:56.887 --> 00:40:58.956
FINDING FEWER NEW PROGRAMS AND

00:40:59.023 --> 00:41:00.858
PRIORITIZING THOSE THAT ADDRESS

00:41:00.925 --> 00:41:02.493
THE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS THAT

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.495
CANNOT BE ADDRESSED WITH- THE

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:07.031
EXISTING PROGRAMS SO IT'S KIND

00:41:07.097 --> 00:41:08.199
OF THAT TYPE OF THINKING

00:41:08.265 --> 00:41:11.135
APPLIED. SOMEWHAT ACROSS THESE

00:41:11.202 --> 00:41:14.171
DIFFERENT AREAS IT WOULD BE MY

00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:18.309
CONTENT. BY MOVING. IMAGE SIX OF

00:41:18.375 --> 00:41:20.878
THE HAND OUT HERE JUST A COUPLE

00:41:20.945 --> 00:41:22.079
OF COMMENTS ON THE STATE-

00:41:22.146 --> 00:41:24.481
OVERALL BUDGET CONDITION. YOU

00:41:24.548 --> 00:41:26.617
MAY RECALL THAT IN RECENT YEARS

00:41:26.684 --> 00:41:27.751
WE HAVE DESCRIBED THE

00:41:27.818 --> 00:41:29.820
ADMINISTRATION'S REVENUE

00:41:29.887 --> 00:41:31.722
ESTIMATE AS IS REASONABLE.

00:41:31.789 --> 00:41:34.625
THOUGH THAT CAUTIOUS AND NOW THE

00:41:34.692 --> 00:41:36.694
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. SHOWS REVENUE

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:37.394
ESTIMATES THERE ARE

00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:39.496
SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN BEFORE

00:41:39.563 --> 00:41:40.931
OVER THE THREE YEAR BUDGET

00:41:40.998 --> 00:41:43.934
WINDOW THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY TWO

00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:45.336
TWENTY THREE THE ADMINISTRATION

00:41:45.402 --> 00:41:47.238
HAS RAISED ITS REVENUE ESTIMATES

00:41:47.304 --> 00:41:49.173
BY FORTY ONE BILLION FROM THE

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.374
BUDGET ACT. MAKING THEM ACTUALLY

00:41:50.441 --> 00:41:54.044
MUCH CLOSER TO WHAT WE CONSIDER

00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:56.046
IT IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT OUR

00:41:56.113 --> 00:41:57.014
REVENUE ESTIMATE. WE'VE KIND OF

00:41:57.081 --> 00:41:58.782
DONE WE'VE DEVELOPED A RANGE OF

00:41:58.849 --> 00:42:01.619
WHAT IS POSSIBLE. AND THERE AT

00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:03.354
THE MINUTE IS NOW PRETTY CLOSE

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.556
TO OUR MEDIAN RANGE OUR OUR%

00:42:05.623 --> 00:42:07.391
MEDIAN ESTIMATE WITHIN THAT

00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:09.193
RANGE SO WE ARE REFERRING TO IT

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.362
AS THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND

00:42:11.428 --> 00:42:13.330
ARIEL. AS LIKELY YOU KNOW THIS

00:42:13.397 --> 00:42:15.032
IS LIKELY TO BE AS- YOU KNOW

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:16.100
IT'S JUST AS LIKELY THAT

00:42:16.166 --> 00:42:17.601
REVENUES WILL COME IN HIGHER IS

00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:18.903
THAT IS THAT WILL THAT THEY'LL

00:42:18.969 --> 00:42:21.572
COME IN LOWER ACCORDING TO OUR

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:24.742
BEST ESTIMATE. THAT SAME LOGIC.

00:42:24.808 --> 00:42:27.044
SAME PROCESS APPLIES TO THE

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:29.013
ADMINISTRATION MULTIPLE YEAR

00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:30.848
REVENUE ESTIMATES. AGAIN THEY

00:42:30.915 --> 00:42:33.550
ARE REASONABLE- AND THEY'RE

00:42:33.617 --> 00:42:35.319
SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN BEFORE

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:36.453
BECAUSE THERE ARE MULTIPLE YOUR

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.122
REVENUE ESTIMATE. BUT AS WE

00:42:38.188 --> 00:42:42.192
NOTED BEFORE- IF YOU ADOPT THE

00:42:42.259 --> 00:42:43.127
REVENUE ESTIMATES THAT ARE

00:42:43.193 --> 00:42:46.563
HIGHER- THEN THEY- INHERENTLY

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.032
ARE GOING TO BE LESS SUBJECT TO

00:42:48.098 --> 00:42:49.733
UPWARD REVISION IN THE FUTURE.

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.901
YOU'RE ALREADY CAPTURING SOME OF

00:42:50.968 --> 00:42:53.504
THAT UPWARD NASH IN THE INITIAL

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.005
ESTIMATE. IT'S REALLY BECOMES

00:42:55.072 --> 00:42:57.341
IMPORTANT WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT

00:42:57.408 --> 00:42:59.910
THE SPENDING PROPOSALS PUT

00:42:59.977 --> 00:43:02.179
FORWARD BY THE ADMINISTRATION-

00:43:02.246 --> 00:43:05.716
REALLY EXCEED. ITS OWN ESTIMATE.

00:43:05.783 --> 00:43:07.851
OF THE STATE'S FUTURE BUDGET

00:43:07.918 --> 00:43:09.620
CAPACITY THIS IS DEMONSTRATED IN

00:43:09.687 --> 00:43:11.555
YOU LOOK AT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:43:11.622 --> 00:43:13.223
MULTIPLE YEAR REVENUE- AND

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:15.592
MULTIPLE YEAR- GENERAL FUND

00:43:15.659 --> 00:43:17.795
FORECAST. IT SHOWS THAT

00:43:17.861 --> 00:43:20.097
NEGATIVE- SPECIAL FUND FOR

00:43:20.164 --> 00:43:22.199
ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY BALANCES IN

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:24.435
THE IN THE THREE YEARS FOLLOWING

00:43:24.501 --> 00:43:26.704
THE BUDGET YEAR SO. IT'S

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:28.872
ESSENTIALLY ASSUMING THAT AT

00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:30.741
SOME POINT ALONG THE WAY.

00:43:30.808 --> 00:43:32.276
REVENUES WILL BE HIGHER THAN

00:43:32.343 --> 00:43:34.111
WHAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED

00:43:34.178 --> 00:43:35.646
TO BE OR THAT EXPENDITURES WILL

00:43:35.713 --> 00:43:39.483
BE LOWER SO. THAT'S SOMETHING TO

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:42.019
KEEP IN MIND- FINALLY ON THE

00:43:42.086 --> 00:43:44.021
LAST PAGE HERE WE HAVE A COUPLE

00:43:44.088 --> 00:43:47.458
OF COMMENTS ABOUT- THE PROPOSAL

00:43:47.524 --> 00:43:50.327
ON ON- RESERVES. AND THE FIRST

00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:52.296
THING I'LL JUST NOTE IS THAT WE

00:43:52.363 --> 00:43:53.731
DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A

00:43:53.797 --> 00:43:56.100
DIFFERENT OF- METHODOLOGY HERE

00:43:56.166 --> 00:43:57.768
WE DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE

00:43:57.835 --> 00:43:59.169
GENERAL PURPOSE RESERVES WHICH

00:43:59.236 --> 00:44:00.337
AS I SAID WHERE THE BUDGET

00:44:00.404 --> 00:44:03.007
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT. THE SFU

00:44:03.073 --> 00:44:05.242
THE SAFETY NET RESERVE. WE

00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:07.845
DIFFERENTIATE THAT GROUP FROM

00:44:07.911 --> 00:44:10.447
THE PROP NINETY EIGHT RESERVE-

00:44:10.514 --> 00:44:13.150
THE- THE PROP NINETY EIGHT

00:44:13.217 --> 00:44:15.285
RESERVE IS VERY HELPFUL. FOR

00:44:15.352 --> 00:44:17.454
MAINTAINING EDUCATION FUNDING IN

00:44:17.521 --> 00:44:19.256
A DOWN YEAR- IT WOULD IT WOULD

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:21.625
PROVIDE A WAY TO- SUSTAIN

00:44:21.692 --> 00:44:22.760
FUNDING FOR THE SCHOOLS AT A

00:44:22.826 --> 00:44:24.795
CONSTANT LEVEL. BUT THOSE

00:44:24.862 --> 00:44:26.063
BALANCES REALLY WOULD NOT BE

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:29.333
AVAILABLE TO HELP THE U. AT THE

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.268
LEGISLATURE OR OUR POLICY

00:44:31.335 --> 00:44:35.105
MAKERS- IT WOULD NOT REALLY BE

00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:36.140
AVAILABLE TO HELP YOU CLOSE AN

00:44:36.206 --> 00:44:38.776
ESTIMATED BUDGET PROBLEMS. SO

00:44:38.842 --> 00:44:42.079
THAT'S THAT'S THE REASON WE MAKE

00:44:42.146 --> 00:44:43.380
THAT DISTINCTION. AND WHEN WE

00:44:43.447 --> 00:44:44.782
LOOK AT THE GENERAL PURPOSE

00:44:44.848 --> 00:44:46.283
RESERVE THEY ARE YOU KNOW

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:48.986
APPROACHING TWENTY FIVE BILLION

00:44:49.053 --> 00:44:50.354
WHICH SHIP FROM A NOMINAL

00:44:50.421 --> 00:44:52.823
STANDPOINT IS VERY I. AGREE I

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:54.625
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT AS A

00:44:54.691 --> 00:44:56.660
SHARE OF THE STATE BUDGET WHICH

00:44:56.727 --> 00:44:58.362
IS REALLY THE IMPORTANT WAY TO

00:44:58.429 --> 00:45:00.164
LOOK AT IT. YOU CAN SEE THAT

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:01.799
THEY STILL REMAIN A LITTLE BIT

00:45:01.865 --> 00:45:05.069
BELOW- WHAT THEIR LEVEL WAS

00:45:05.135 --> 00:45:07.204
HIRED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC SO.

00:45:07.271 --> 00:45:09.273
YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO THINK

00:45:09.339 --> 00:45:11.375
THAT- CONSIDERING HIGHER

00:45:11.442 --> 00:45:12.910
DISCRETIONARY RESERVE IS

00:45:12.976 --> 00:45:15.612
WARRANTED AND- SO WITH THAT I'LL

00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:18.682
STOP HERE AND- I KNOW THAT ALONG

00:45:18.749 --> 00:45:19.983
WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:23.020

FACT THAT IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET.

00:48:01.245 --> 00:48:02.846
AND THERE WERE A LOT OF

00:48:02.913 --> 00:48:04.881
DIFFERENT INITIATIVES STARTED

KIND OF ROLLING OUT SOME OF

00:48:19.896 --> 00:48:21.365
THESE INITIATIVES AND

00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:22.132
IMPLEMENTING. SOME OF THE

00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:23.834
INITIATIVES THAT HAD STARTED

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:26.570
WERE LIKEWISE HOW THEY WOULD

00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:28.905
COORDINATE OR COMPLIMENT REALLY

00:48:28.972 --> 00:48:30.540
SOME OF THE NEW INITIATIVES THAT

THE GOVERNOR'S PUT FORWARD THIS

00:48:31.842 --> 00:48:34.111
YEAR WHICH HAVE. IN SOME CASES

00:48:34.177 --> 00:48:38.815
THAT'S SIMILAR. FOUNDING EXCEPT

00:48:38.882 --> 00:48:43.920
THE SIMILAR SOUNDING- GOAL- THE

THAT AND SO IT'S A VERY

00:48:58.001 --> 00:48:59.503
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE I THINK

00:48:59.569 --> 00:49:01.171
MANY OF US WOULD AGREE IT'S AN

00:49:01.238 --> 00:49:04.107
IMPORTANT- PROBABLY AN IMPORTANT

00:49:04.174 --> 00:49:07.311

WE'RE STILL GOING THROUGH SOME

00:49:57.461 --> 00:49:58.995

GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BECAUSE IT'S

00:51:40.931 --> 00:51:45.268
ROBUST- HE HAS- THE BUDGET

00:51:45.335 --> 00:51:47.103
ALLOCATES QUITE A BIT OF MONEY

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:49.306
FOR- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND

00:51:49.372 --> 00:51:51.508
MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS AND MY

00:51:51.575 --> 00:51:55.278
QUESTION IS- I'D LIKE YOUR

00:51:55.345 --> 00:51:58.748
THOUGHTS. ON IF IT MAKES SENSE

00:51:58.815 --> 00:52:01.785
FOR US TO KIND OF CREATE AN A

00:52:01.852 --> 00:52:04.221
WELLNESS PACKAGE ON HOW WE CAN

00:52:04.287 --> 00:52:06.189
SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH AND

00:52:06.256 --> 00:52:07.190
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ACROSS THE

00:52:07.257 --> 00:52:10.060
STATE OR DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO

00:52:10.126 --> 00:52:11.761
KIND OF HAVE THOSE DOLLARS

00:52:11.828 --> 00:52:16.766
INFUSED ACROSS THE VARIOUS-

00:52:16.833 --> 00:52:18.001
DEPARTMENTS OR AGENCIES OR ISSUE

00:52:18.068 --> 00:52:22.339
AREAS. WE WANT TO FIND- BECAUSE

00:52:22.405 --> 00:52:22.873
IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS

00:52:22.939 --> 00:52:25.876
PERMEATING YOU KNOW EVERY WALK

00:52:25.942 --> 00:52:29.145
OF LIFE- AND WANTING TO KNOW

00:52:29.212 --> 00:52:33.250
DIFFERENT OTHER- APPROACHES TO

00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:35.318
HOW WE CAN MAYBE ADDRESS THIS I

00:52:35.385 --> 00:52:37.587
CERTAINLY THINK THIS IS GOING TO

00:52:37.654 --> 00:52:39.222
BE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE. FOR A

00:52:39.289 --> 00:52:42.425
WHILE FOR US- AND THEN MY SECOND

00:52:42.492 --> 00:52:45.095
QUESTION TO JUST ATTACK ON TO

00:52:45.161 --> 00:52:48.665
MY- WHAT DOES SENATOR CORTESE

00:52:48.732 --> 00:52:50.333
ASKED IS KIND OF THOUGHTS ON.

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.869
THAT D. OUT WE KNOW THAT A

00:52:52.936 --> 00:52:55.906
NUMBER OF WELL SO LET ME JUST

00:52:55.972 --> 00:52:57.407
ASK THE FIRST QUESTION OKAY. FOR

00:52:57.474 --> 00:53:04.514
ADULTS TO LSU YEAH. OKAY YES

00:53:04.581 --> 00:53:05.982
WELL I MEAN THE FIRST THING I

00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:08.084
MIGHT SAY IS THAT WE WOULD BE

00:53:08.151 --> 00:53:09.819
HAPPY TO GO THROUGH SOME OF

00:53:09.886 --> 00:53:12.522
THESE IN MORE DETAIL- I THINK I

00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:13.957
GOT THE GIST OF YOUR QUESTION

00:53:14.024 --> 00:53:15.959
BUT I MIGHT ACTUALLY- TURN TO MY

00:53:16.026 --> 00:53:19.396
COLLEAGUE- MARK NEWTON DID SEE

00:53:19.462 --> 00:53:21.131
IF- IF. HE HAD SOMETHING MORE

00:53:21.197 --> 00:53:23.833
SPECIFIC AT ALL. THE BIG

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:30.173
QUESTION- THAT YOU YOU RAISED.

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:40.550
SOME NEAT. YES GOOD GOOD MORNING

00:53:40.617 --> 00:53:42.319
MEMBERS MARK NEWTON- WITH THE

00:53:42.385 --> 00:53:45.722
LA- CAN IT MIGHT BE HER YES

00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:49.125
YOU'RE BEING HURT VERY GOOD YES

00:53:49.192 --> 00:53:50.360
THE SENDER BREEZES A UP. A LOT

00:53:50.427 --> 00:53:52.329
OF VERY IMPORTANT PART AND SHE'S

00:53:52.395 --> 00:53:53.897
BEEN IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:53:53.964 --> 00:53:55.865
CONTEXT AND WHAT IS TRUE IS THAT

00:53:55.932 --> 00:53:57.834
THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF BEHAVIORAL

00:53:57.901 --> 00:54:01.771
HEALTH- IS VERY BIFURCATED IN

00:54:01.838 --> 00:54:03.873
TERMS OF THE DELIVERY AND I

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:06.242
THINK IN IN RECENT YEARS-

00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:07.911
THERE'S BEEN AN EFFORT TO SEE.

00:54:07.978 --> 00:54:09.646
TAKE A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO

00:54:09.713 --> 00:54:12.349
THE TO THE ISSUE AND- IN

00:54:12.415 --> 00:54:13.717
RECOGNIZING THAT THE BEHAVIOR

00:54:13.783 --> 00:54:15.552
HEALTH CONNECTION WITH THAT

00:54:15.619 --> 00:54:16.886
WHICH WE CALL THROUGH THE SOCIAL

00:54:16.953 --> 00:54:20.490
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND- AND

00:54:20.557 --> 00:54:24.160
HOMELESSNESS AND- SO I THINK THE

00:54:24.227 --> 00:54:25.829
BEAT THE BUDGET PROPOSAL DOES

00:54:25.895 --> 00:54:28.131
REFLECT. PROPOSALS THAT REFLECTS

00:54:28.198 --> 00:54:30.000
THE OVERALL TO REVIEW THERE

00:54:30.066 --> 00:54:31.201
STILL IS THE ISSUE OF

00:54:31.267 --> 00:54:34.771
IMPLEMENTATION BY- VARIOUS

00:54:34.838 --> 00:54:38.808
DEPARTMENTS AND- AND I THINK

00:54:38.875 --> 00:54:41.911
THERE'S ROOM FOR- ONLY HELPS

00:54:41.978 --> 00:54:43.513
EVEN MORE COORDINATED APPROACH

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:47.017
BUT I THINK THE- THE LEGISLATION

00:54:47.083 --> 00:54:48.284
ADMINISTRATION ARE MOVING MORE

00:54:48.351 --> 00:54:49.919
STRICT IN THAT DIRECTION THERE

00:54:49.986 --> 00:54:52.255
IS A VERY VERY MAJOR

00:54:52.322 --> 00:54:53.356
INVESTMENTS- LAST YEAR IN IN

00:54:53.423 --> 00:54:55.291
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THE SERVER

00:54:55.358 --> 00:54:56.259
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ARE JUST

00:54:56.326 --> 00:54:58.461
BEGINNING AND- GOT A SENATOR

00:54:58.528 --> 00:54:59.729
MENTIONED ANYTHING VERY

00:54:59.796 --> 00:55:01.965
IMPORTANT TO MONITOR. THE

00:55:02.032 --> 00:55:03.466
PROGRESS OF THOSE INVESTMENTS AS

00:55:03.533 --> 00:55:04.334
WELL AS IMPLEMENTATION

00:55:04.401 --> 00:55:06.569
CHALLENGES THERE'S NEW MONEY

00:55:06.636 --> 00:55:08.738
THIS YEAR TO SIGNIFICANT SET NEW

00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:11.074
INVESTMENT IN SORT OF BRIDGE

00:55:11.141 --> 00:55:13.576
HOUSING- BUT SET AT ALL ONLY NO

00:55:13.643 --> 00:55:15.111
I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT AS

00:55:15.178 --> 00:55:17.380
YOU ALLUDE TO. LOOK AT BEHAVIOR

00:55:17.447 --> 00:55:19.082
HEALTH SERVICE AS A- AND YOU

00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:21.084
SHOOT THAT CUTS AROSS A NUMBER

00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:22.786
OF POLICIES THROUGH VARIOUS IN A

00:55:22.852 --> 00:55:26.156
IN THE- IN- IN STATE GOVERNMENT

00:55:26.222 --> 00:55:28.591
AND WORKING TOWARDS THAT-

00:55:28.658 --> 00:55:33.463
THROUGH A. MORE CORNY.

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:34.864
INVESTMENTS ARE- TO THE MOST IN

00:55:34.931 --> 00:55:36.499
. WAY OF ADDRESS THAT ADDRESSING

00:55:36.566 --> 00:55:37.534
THE ISSUE BUT WE REALLY LOOK

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.135
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE

00:55:39.202 --> 00:55:40.070
LEGISLATURE ON ON EVALUATING

00:55:40.136 --> 00:55:44.741

OUT ON THE TEACHER SHORTAGE THAT

00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:09.799
EXISTS AND SUBSTITUTE SHORTAGE

00:56:09.866 --> 00:56:11.167
ON THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNOR

00:56:11.234 --> 00:56:13.002
REGIONALLY SAID HE WANTED TO BUY

00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:16.706

DECLINE HAS BEEN EXACERBATED AND

00:57:00.784 --> 00:57:02.752
THIS BUDGET PROPOSES A THREE

00:57:02.819 --> 00:57:05.889
YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE OF IT. AS A

00:57:05.955 --> 00:57:08.124
WAY TO DEAL WITH FUNDING BUT

00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:13.696
IT'S CREATING A CLIFF. AT. WE

00:57:13.763 --> 00:57:15.565
MIGHT DO ABOUT SCHOOL FINANCING

IT JUST DOES THE ADMINISTRATION

00:57:23.339 --> 00:57:25.275

FOR ALL BUT I DID HAVE A

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:36.359

THE SENIORS- BUT I'M STRAIGHT

01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:54.510
UNDERSTAND AS TO WHY THE-

01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:56.045
OPPOSING THE WAY TO. TWENTY

01:01:56.112 --> 01:01:57.880
INSTEAD OF TRYING TO DO A LITTLE

01:01:57.947 --> 01:01:58.714
EARLIER- ESPECIALLY SEVERE

01:01:58.781 --> 01:02:00.650

THANK YOU SENATOR PAT- YES

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:14.197
YOU'RE RIGHT DH CS IS WORKING-

01:02:14.263 --> 01:02:15.965
MANY PROGRAMS AT THIS POINT AS

01:02:16.032 --> 01:02:17.967
HAS BEEN POINTED OUT. IN IN

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:19.902
REGARDS TO- FORMER INVESTMENTS

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:22.171
BUT SPECIFICALLY ON THE FIFTY

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:26.709
PLUS. EXPANSION AND THAT WILL BE

01:02:26.776 --> 01:02:28.544
THIS. I THINK SEEING THE CLUB

01:02:28.611 --> 01:02:30.613
BASICALLY THE LONG RUNWAY- THAT

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.581
IT WILL TAKE BE-

01:02:31.647 --> 01:02:33.116
ADMINISTRATION'S REALLY SIXTY

01:02:33.182 --> 01:02:35.585
SUCCESSFUL AT DELIVERING THIS

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:37.954
PROPOSAL- PART OF IT IS STILL

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:41.290
ALLOW FOR- SYSTEMS TO BE READY

01:02:41.357 --> 01:02:42.825
FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE

01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:47.163
SURE THAT THIS. IS SUCCESSFUL SO

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:47.930
THAT'S THE THAT'S THE REASON FOR

01:02:47.997 --> 01:02:50.199
THE LONG RUN. OKAY I WOULDN'T

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:51.367
MENTION OUR EXPERIENCE BOTH WITH

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:54.637
THE- USE THAT UNDER TWENTY SIX

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:56.672
AND THE OTHER FIFTY I MEAN AND

01:02:56.739 --> 01:02:58.574
FACT BE ABLE TO GO OUT TO PEOPLE

01:02:58.641 --> 01:03:00.009
AND SAY WE CAN COVER EVERYONE

01:03:00.076 --> 01:03:01.511
INSTEAD OF BY PIECES ACTUALLY

01:03:01.577 --> 01:03:03.513
WOULD BE SIMPLER. SO I'M NOT

01:03:03.579 --> 01:03:06.349
SURE WHY THE BIG LONG RUNWAY SO

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:07.650
NECESSARY IT'S NOT LIKE WE

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:09.552
HAVEN'T DONE THIS BEFORE BUT- I

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:10.720
APPRECIATE THAT HOPE TO DELVE

01:03:10.786 --> 01:03:12.822
INTO THAT A LITTLE MORE I ALSO

01:03:12.889 --> 01:03:14.390
MAKE NOTE THAT. THEY DID

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:15.691
RECOGNIZE YOU DIDN'T SAY IT WAS

01:03:15.758 --> 01:03:17.727
A MONEY ISSUE TIMING WISE BUT I

01:03:17.793 --> 01:03:19.462
WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT- WE

01:03:19.529 --> 01:03:21.197
WERE NOT RENEWING THE MCO TAX

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:22.598
WHICH WOULD BE A POTENTIAL

01:03:22.665 --> 01:03:24.433
SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR- X.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:27.103
MEDIKAL EXPANSIONS AS WELL SO.

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:29.739
LOOK FOR THE DELVING INTO. THE

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:32.341
OTHER QUITE I HAVE IS IN AGAIN

01:03:32.408 --> 01:03:33.109
PC TO GOVERNOR PROPOSING.

01:03:33.176 --> 01:03:34.777
INCREASES IN SOCIAL SERVICES.

01:03:34.844 --> 01:03:38.314
AND MATT ACCOUNT EXPANSION. BUT

01:03:38.381 --> 01:03:40.082
SERVE AS THE LA- MENTIONED IN

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:41.617
TERMS OF RESERVES WE'RE NOT

01:03:41.684 --> 01:03:43.052
ADDING ANYTHING TO THE SAFETY

01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:45.555
NET RESERVE. SO WELL CERTAINLY

01:03:45.621 --> 01:03:47.990
WE DO HAVE THE ON THE NINE

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:48.891
HUNDRED MILLION FROM THE

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:49.592
PREVIOUS YEARS. AS WE ARE

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:51.727
INCREASING OUR COMMITMENTS AND

01:03:51.794 --> 01:03:54.797
AN IMPORTANT WE DO SELL- TO TRY

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:56.699
TO SHIELD US FROM DOWNTURNS

01:03:56.766 --> 01:03:58.968
DURING RECESSIONS- IS THERE A

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:00.970
REASON WHY WE'RE NOT AT. THE

01:04:01.037 --> 01:04:05.274
SAFETY NET RESERVE. THIS YEAR-

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:07.109
I'LL JUST TAKE THAT ABOUT A HIGH

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:08.811
LEVEL IN REGARDS TO PRESERVE I

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:11.547
THINK THAT WE THAT RECENT

01:04:11.614 --> 01:04:13.616
RESEARCH THIS IS A GOOD IDEA I

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:15.851
THINK WE ALSO ARE. TRYING TO

01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:18.654
BALANCE INCREASED DEPOSITS INTO

01:04:18.721 --> 01:04:19.889
THE RESERVES. AGAINST THE STATE

01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:21.090
APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT AND SO

01:04:21.157 --> 01:04:22.925
ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS INTO

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:25.061
RESEARCH HOW AND THAT'S

01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:27.730
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE- NOT- WE

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:31.434
HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS TO. BUT

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.970
SOME THAT ARE GOING FOR OTHER

01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:37.540
PRIORITIES- INTO THE RESERVES AS

01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:39.242
AS A RESULT SO IT JUST REALLY

01:04:39.308 --> 01:04:40.676
TRYING TO MAKE THAT BALANCE

01:04:40.743 --> 01:04:43.012
AGAIN I JUST WANT TO. HIGHLIGHT

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:45.147
THE FACT THAT THIS IS THE FIRST

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:47.250
BUDGET AS A LAUNCHING PAD FOR

01:04:47.316 --> 01:04:48.251
DISCUSSION. AND HAPPY TO

01:04:48.317 --> 01:04:49.452
CONTINUE THESE DISCUSSIONS IN

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:51.454
THE SPRING OKAY NO I APPRECIATE

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.055
THAT AND BREAK NOTE THAT PERHAPS

01:04:53.122 --> 01:04:55.458
AGAIN LIMIT WAS WRITTEN AT A

01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:56.993
TIME FOUR YOU KNOW WHERE WOULD.

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:59.095
WE HAVE A YOU KNOW FORTUNATELY

01:04:59.161 --> 01:05:01.397
WE ARE PUTTING RESERVE SO THAT

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:02.832
WE CAN KEEP OUR BUDGET STABLE

01:05:02.898 --> 01:05:05.234
DURING. THAT TIMES AND MAYBE

01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:07.837
THAT MEANS AN EXPLORATION OF- OF

01:05:07.903 --> 01:05:09.105
WHETHER RESERVE SHOULD BE

01:05:09.171 --> 01:05:10.039
COUNTED AGAINST THE AND LET ME

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:11.807
KNOW WHAT THEY ARE I KNOW THE

01:05:11.874 --> 01:05:14.844
LEXUS IN LAW IS WHAT IT IS NOW

01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:15.511
PERHAPS THERE'S AN IT SHOULD BE

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:16.879
AN EXPLORATION OF. HOW MIGHT

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:17.947
WANT TO TALK ABOUT MODIFYING IT

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:19.649
IN THE FUTURE AND HAVING

01:05:19.715 --> 01:05:20.683
CONVERSATIONS THE PUBLIC ABOUT

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.286

KNOW CERTAINLY WE WANT TO

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:25.187
CONTINUE SUPPORT SCHOOLS ARE

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:26.989
FIGHTING COATED- BUT DIDN'T

01:05:27.056 --> 01:05:28.624
EXIST QUESTIONS FOR THE ALLEY OF

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:30.559
IS HE DID MAKE MENTION YOUR

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:31.193
RECOMMENDATIONS THIS ISSUE OF

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:34.497
LONG TERM. COVE IN NINETEEN

01:05:34.563 --> 01:05:37.300
PLANNING AND I AGREE WITH YOU-

01:05:37.366 --> 01:05:39.168
WE NEED TO. NOW THIS IS SERVICE

01:05:39.235 --> 01:05:41.137
YEAR OF ABOUT. IN YEAH WELL

01:05:41.203 --> 01:05:42.371
THIRTY YEARS OF PANDEMIC AND-

01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:44.607
WE'RE REALLY THINKING ABOUT BUT

01:05:44.674 --> 01:05:45.875
STARTING TO THINK ABOUT LONG

01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:47.610
TERM SO I GUESS MY QUESTION FOR

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:51.280
THE LA- IS THAT- WHEN USED IN

01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:52.748
WHEN YOU SEARCH A LONG TERM

01:05:52.815 --> 01:05:54.450
COVERED PLANNING THANK YOU SIR

01:05:54.517 --> 01:05:55.751
MAYBE ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:57.019
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING I'LL JUST

01:05:57.086 --> 01:05:58.754
SAY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE SOME OF

01:05:58.821 --> 01:06:00.656
THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:02.024
THINKING ABOUT. ONE IS THAT-

01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:03.859
COLD IT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY

01:06:03.926 --> 01:06:05.328
NOW HOPEFULLY WE'RE NOT GONNA

01:06:05.394 --> 01:06:06.162
HAVE SURGES LIKE WE'RE SEEING

01:06:06.228 --> 01:06:07.963
THIS YEAR INVESTORS SAW LAST.

01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:10.199
MIKE IS THAT ON TOP OF FLU AND

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:11.767
OTHER THINGS THAT NORMALLY. WILL

01:06:11.834 --> 01:06:13.703
INCREASE IN THE WINTER. WE'RE

01:06:13.769 --> 01:06:15.671
GONNA HAVE TO HOLD IT ON TOP

01:06:15.738 --> 01:06:16.939
EXACTLY HOW MANY. HOW LARGE IT

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:18.941
IS I DON'T KNOW BUT- CERTAINLY

01:06:19.008 --> 01:06:20.009
IT'S GOING TO PUT PRESSURE ON

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:22.311
THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SHOULD WE

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:22.978
BE MAKING INFRASTRUCTURE

01:06:23.045 --> 01:06:24.080
INVESTMENTS IN HOSPITALS AND

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:25.614
OTHER SO THAT. OTHERWISE WE KEEP

01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:27.450
RUNNING OUT OF BEDS EVERY

01:06:27.516 --> 01:06:29.318
WINTER- WITH EVERY TIME WE HAVE

01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:31.587
ANOTHER COVERT SEARCH. SO CELL

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:32.788
WAS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT

01:06:32.855 --> 01:06:33.789
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT ME SAID

01:06:33.856 --> 01:06:34.890
LONG TERM COVERED PLANNING

01:06:34.957 --> 01:06:37.727
ANOTHER ISSUE IS THAT WE NO

01:06:37.793 --> 01:06:40.429
LONGER HOLD IT. AS A PROBLEM.

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:41.731
CHILLED SO THAT WOULD MEAN

01:06:41.797 --> 01:06:43.132
INCREASED INVESTMENTS AND THINGS

01:08:37.746 --> 01:08:39.982
RECOMMENDED THAT THERE'S- THE

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:42.218
INMATE POPULATION TO GET TRENDS

01:08:42.284 --> 01:08:43.986

01:09:07.076 --> 01:09:08.911
IMPORTANT- COMPONENT ARE A CON

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:10.379
IN THE- SIDE OF OUR ECONOMY AND

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:23.325
LAST YEAR. FOUR MILLION WORKERS

01:14:23.392 --> 01:14:24.493
WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE PAID SICK

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.528
LEAVE. AND THAT WAS BECAUSE OF

01:14:26.595 --> 01:14:28.964
THE EMPLOYER THRESHOLD. WE'RE

01:14:29.031 --> 01:14:31.099
TELLING WORKERS STAY HOME WHEN

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:35.604
YOU'RE SICK. BUT WE ARE NOT

01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:37.439
SETTING UP THE RULES IN SUCH A

01:14:37.506 --> 01:14:39.808
WAY THAT THEY CAN STAY HOME WHEN

01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:41.643
THEY'RE SICK SO I'M VERY

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:43.779
CONCERNED- AND I REALLY

01:14:43.846 --> 01:14:46.248
APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:48.250
THE GOVERNOR PUTTING A

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:51.286
SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE AS

01:14:51.353 --> 01:14:53.488
AN ISSUE FOR EARLY ÒION

01:14:53.555 --> 01:14:55.691
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE SIZE OF

01:14:55.757 --> 01:14:58.660
THE EMPLOYERS THAT WOULD BE

01:14:58.727 --> 01:15:02.397
COVERED- IT MIGHT MY DISTRICT

01:15:02.464 --> 01:15:04.366
AND DRAW LOS ANGELES THERE'S-

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:05.634
PROBABLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

01:15:05.701 --> 01:15:07.736
OF SMALL BUSINESSES BUT I DON'T

01:15:07.803 --> 01:15:09.805
MEAN SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE YOU

01:15:09.872 --> 01:15:11.807
KNOW A HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED. I

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:14.643
MEAN A SMALL BUSINESSES THAT

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:16.278
REALLY EXIST FOR THEIR OWN

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:19.581
SURVIVAL AND SURVIVAL OF THE FEW

01:15:19.648 --> 01:15:21.984
WORKERS THAT WORK FOR THEM- THE

01:15:22.050 --> 01:15:23.652
SMALLER THE BUSINESSES AND THIS

01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:26.054
IS JUST ME I DON'T HAVE THE

01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:28.123
EXACT NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME BUT

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:30.158
IT'S LESS LIKELY THAT THESE

01:15:30.225 --> 01:15:32.394
EMPLOYEES HAVE A SAFETY NET IS

01:15:32.461 --> 01:15:36.198
LESS LIKELY IT'S MORE LIKELY.

01:15:36.265 --> 01:15:39.034
YOU KNOW THERE ARE MINIMUM WAGE

01:15:39.101 --> 01:15:41.069
IF AT ALL. BLACK LATINO AND-

01:15:41.136 --> 01:15:44.640
WOMEN. API THEY'RE NOT LIKELY TO

01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:46.842
HAVE DONE THE STIMULUS CHECK OR

01:15:46.909 --> 01:15:50.312
ARE YOU I MEAN- WE'RE SETTING

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:52.781
THE RULES HERE ON TO EXCLUDE

01:15:52.848 --> 01:15:56.018
THEM- AND THEN WE WONDER WHY

01:15:56.084 --> 01:15:59.288
THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH- EQUITY

01:15:59.354 --> 01:16:00.822
OUT WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE WHO

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:03.592
ARE POOR AND THOSE WHO. DON'T

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:05.527
HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SO I

01:16:05.594 --> 01:16:10.799
REALLY WANT TO- YOU KNOW. HOPEN

01:16:10.866 --> 01:16:13.035
ASKED ADMINISTRATION TO ADDRESS

01:16:13.101 --> 01:16:15.604
THIS BECAUSE- YO KNOW 80% OF

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:18.373
ALL WORKERS- WORK FOR A BUSINESS

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:19.841
THAT'S LESS THAN TWENTY.

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:23.111
EMPLOYEES SO- AGAIN THIS I DON'T

01:16:23.178 --> 01:16:24.880
THINK WE SHOULD BE REACTING TO

01:16:24.947 --> 01:16:26.982
EQUITY ISSUES WE ALWAYS START

01:16:27.049 --> 01:16:29.284
TRYING TO COVER YOU KNOW WHAT

01:16:29.351 --> 01:16:31.787
HAPPENS AFTER THE FACT AFTER

01:16:31.853 --> 01:16:33.388
PEOPLE DIE AFTER PEOPLE ARE

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:35.557
HOSPITALIZED. IN THESE

01:16:35.624 --> 01:16:38.927
COMMUNITIES OF WE HAVE TO THINK

01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:40.162

REAL FOCUS ON THAT SO AGAIN JUST

01:23:23.264 --> 01:23:25.667

THOUSAND TWELVE IS WHEN IT WENT

01:23:48.022 --> 01:23:50.658

OFFER THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT OUR

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:53.695
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM HAS

01:23:53.762 --> 01:23:54.763
IMPROVED. SINCE WE GOT RID OF

01:23:54.829 --> 01:23:57.465
THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH

DELEO WHOSE OFFICE WHAT. SOME OF

01:24:08.309 --> 01:24:09.944
THE- QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE GONNA

01:24:10.011 --> 01:24:11.780
BE DELVING INTO YOU AS YOU START

01:24:11.846 --> 01:24:15.450
YOUR HEARINGS- ALL RIGHT SO WE

GETTING A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN

01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:28.329
THIS BUDGET- BUT OBVIOUSLY S. AS

01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:29.898
MY COLLEAGUES HAVE POINTED OUT

01:24:29.964 --> 01:24:30.765
THERE'S A LOT TO LIKE ABOUT

01:24:30.832 --> 01:24:33.234
THIS- IN COURSE IS A GOOD

01:24:33.301 --> 01:24:33.968
PROBLEM TO HAVE WHEN YOUR

01:24:34.035 --> 01:24:35.937

COLLEAGUE AND SENATOR STERN

01:24:39.874 --> 01:24:42.477
ABOUT THE SCOPE OF TIME

01:24:42.544 --> 01:24:43.545
INVESTMENT I THINK IT'S REALLY

01:24:43.611 --> 01:24:45.280
IMPORTANT ON INFRASTRUCTURE I

01:24:45.346 --> 01:24:47.081
WAS ALSO REALLY PLEASED TO SEE A

01:24:47.148 --> 01:24:48.650
NUMBER OF IMPORTANT TAX CREDITS

01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:50.852
THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING- TO HELP

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:53.688
DEVELOP ROUTINE ARE INDEED TO

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:56.090
PROVIDE FUNDING TO THE U. SEES

01:24:56.157 --> 01:24:57.759
FOR GREEN RD IN THIS IT'S BEEN

01:24:57.826 --> 01:24:59.060
SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN PUSHING FOR

01:24:59.127 --> 01:25:01.029
THE LAST TWO YEARS SO- YOU KNOW

01:25:01.095 --> 01:25:01.729
I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THAT

01:25:01.796 --> 01:25:04.098
BECAUSE I THINK. WHILE MANDATES

01:25:04.165 --> 01:25:05.300
TO PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT MARKET

01:25:05.366 --> 01:25:06.634
SIGNAL WE ALSO NEED TO KIND OF

01:25:06.701 --> 01:25:08.570
PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS

01:25:08.636 --> 01:25:10.205
AND GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:11.105
CLIMATE ADAPTATION OF

01:25:11.172 --> 01:25:13.408
DEVELOPMENT- I THINK PROVIDING

01:25:13.475 --> 01:25:16.578
FUNDING FOR R&amp;D IS GOING TO BE

01:25:16.644 --> 01:25:18.446
CRITICAL I'M ALSO PLEASED TO SEE

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:20.381
SO MUCH FUNDING GOING TO THE

01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:22.617
BASE- INCREASES HERE FOR THE NEW

01:25:22.684 --> 01:25:25.019
SEASONS YES USE- AS WELL AS THE

01:25:25.086 --> 01:25:26.921
CAL GRANTS IN AND LOOK FORWARD

01:25:26.988 --> 01:25:28.590
TO THE HEARINGS WILL HAVE ON

01:25:28.656 --> 01:25:29.624
THAT AND BUDGET SUB ONE. MY

01:25:29.691 --> 01:25:31.359
QUESTION HERE IS YOU KNOW IN

01:25:31.426 --> 01:25:32.861
ANOTHER GREAT THING I THINK IS

01:25:32.927 --> 01:25:34.596
BUT IT'S DOING IS IT'S PAYING

01:25:34.662 --> 01:25:36.364
DOWN MORE OF OUR PENSION

01:25:36.431 --> 01:25:38.800
LIABILITIES I AND- YEAH I THINK

01:25:38.867 --> 01:25:40.935
THAT'S IMPORTANT JUST SO THAT WE

01:25:41.002 --> 01:25:42.237
DON'T END UP WITH A PROBLEM DOWN

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:44.339
THE LINE AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO

01:25:44.405 --> 01:25:46.174
WITH THE ONE TIME SURPLUS THE

01:25:46.241 --> 01:25:47.575
KIND OF PAY DOWN OUR FUTURE

01:25:47.642 --> 01:25:48.810
LIABILITIES ONE QUESTION I HAD

01:25:48.877 --> 01:25:51.012
IS AN ALLUSION TO THIS IN THE

01:25:51.079 --> 01:25:52.080
REPORT THAT WE RECEIVED IN LA-

01:25:52.146 --> 01:25:53.581
SO THIS COULD BE L. A. O. OR

01:25:53.648 --> 01:25:55.350
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT- I DID

01:25:55.416 --> 01:25:56.818
IT BECAUSE OF INCREASED RETURNS

01:25:56.885 --> 01:25:57.685
ON. THE STOCK MARKETS AND

01:25:57.752 --> 01:25:59.220
WHATNOT THAT ARE DRIVING SOME OF

01:25:59.287 --> 01:26:01.589
OUR TAX REVENUES- THAT WE SEEN A

01:26:01.656 --> 01:26:03.958
DECREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF

01:26:04.025 --> 01:26:06.227
OUTSTANDING LIABILITIES- IN THE

01:26:06.294 --> 01:26:07.595
PROJECTED RETURNS NEEDED TO

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:10.231
REACH- BREAK EVEN POINT I WAS

01:26:10.298 --> 01:26:12.200
ONE OF EITHER YOU COULD SPEAK TO

01:26:12.267 --> 01:26:13.535
THAT- DEPARTMENT FINANCER LA- AS

01:26:13.601 --> 01:26:15.637
FAR AS WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN IN

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:18.573
CANISTERS AND PURRS ON A RATE OF

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:24.746
RETURN HAD. WE DO LAST YEAR AND

01:26:24.812 --> 01:26:26.114
HOW DOES THAT IMPACT OUR LONG

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:27.749
TERM- PICTURE WITH HAWKING.

01:26:27.815 --> 01:26:28.750
MIGHT I THANK YOU FOR THE

01:26:28.816 --> 01:26:29.751
QUESTION CENTER MEN AND ANY TO

01:26:29.817 --> 01:26:32.620
THAT BOTH- HACKSAW RETURNS IN

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:35.957
THE 20% LAST YEAR SO STOP HERS

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:39.060
HAD ANY- TWENTY ONE POINT 3%

01:26:39.127 --> 01:26:43.197
RETURN- AND STURRIDGE HAD EIGHT

01:26:43.264 --> 01:26:45.633
TWENTY SEVEN POINT 2% RETURN SO-

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:47.535
JUST IN IN REGARDS TO WHAT THAT

01:26:47.602 --> 01:26:50.271
MEANS TO THE SYSTEM- AS AN

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:51.839
EXAMPLE HERS IS UNFUNDED

01:26:51.906 --> 01:26:54.275
LIABILITY- SIXTY THREE BILLION

01:26:54.342 --> 01:27:00.248
AND IT IS. UP PRIOR TO- FIVE DID

01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:02.483
YOU KNOW THAT THE TWENTY ONE

01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:04.519
TWENTY ONE POINT 3% INCREASE IT

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:07.155
WAS 70% AND NOW AFTER THE

01:27:07.221 --> 01:27:08.122
ACCOUNT FOR THAT RETURN IT'S

01:27:08.189 --> 01:27:09.924
GOING TO BE 80% SO THAT'S THAT'S

01:27:09.991 --> 01:27:11.926
A- BOOK THAT THE POSITIVE

01:27:11.993 --> 01:27:14.362
IMPACTS TO PURCHASE AND- I'M

01:27:14.429 --> 01:27:17.332
STIRS THE STATION THAT WE HAVE-

01:27:17.398 --> 01:27:18.700
SO WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT

01:27:18.766 --> 01:27:20.268
CONTRIBUTING ADDITIONAL PROP TO

01:27:20.335 --> 01:27:22.337
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT. THE

01:27:22.403 --> 01:27:27.141
ESTIMATES RIGHT. NOW IS THAT THE

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:28.509
STATE SHARE- HAPPEN. SO THOSE

01:27:28.576 --> 01:27:29.978
ARE RESULTS OF THE WORK THAT

01:27:30.044 --> 01:27:33.815
WERE FOR MONSTERS IF YOU NEED TO

01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:36.317
THEIR INVESTMENTS EXACTLY. LIKE

01:27:36.384 --> 01:27:39.153
A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN. MR

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:41.689
PATRICK I SEE AT THE END OF. YES

01:27:41.756 --> 01:27:43.591
THANK YOU SENATOR MAN AT THE

01:27:43.658 --> 01:27:46.561
GOOD QUESTION AND THEN I THINK-

01:27:46.628 --> 01:27:49.797
YOU KNOW THE THING THAT WE WOULD

01:27:49.864 --> 01:27:52.033
JUST POINT OUT IS THAT. INTERNAL

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:52.567
BILITY CURRENTLY REPRESENT

01:27:52.634 --> 01:27:54.035
SOMEWHAT OF A TRADE OFF THE

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:55.970
TENSIONS ARE GENERALLY IN BETTER

01:27:56.037 --> 01:27:57.705
SHAPE AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM

01:27:57.772 --> 01:28:01.142
FINANCE JUST SAD- AND SO THE

01:28:01.209 --> 01:28:03.478
TRADE UP WE THINK IS PROBABLY

01:28:03.544 --> 01:28:05.546
THAT. PUTTING MORE IN RESERVE IS

01:28:05.613 --> 01:28:07.749
PROBABLY. A BETTER PLACE AT THE

01:28:07.815 --> 01:28:10.051
MOMENT- THE HIGHER RATE OF

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:13.087
RETURN THEN IN CALPERS. ALLOWED

01:28:13.154 --> 01:28:15.590
THE BIG HELPERS SIT IN TO TAKE A

01:28:15.657 --> 01:28:17.792
STEP TO REDUCE ITS ASSUMPTION

01:28:17.859 --> 01:28:19.727
WHEN IT COMES TO FUTURE RATE OF

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:23.131
RETURN WHICH IS PROBABLY. A YOU

01:28:23.197 --> 01:28:26.367
KNOW A HEALTHY HEALTHY STEP- AND

01:28:26.434 --> 01:28:30.038
SO IT THAT'S GOOD THE- ACTUARIES

01:28:30.104 --> 01:28:31.806
ESTIMATE THAT THE CHARACTERS

01:28:31.873 --> 01:28:33.641
LIABILITY THE STATE PORTION OF

01:28:33.708 --> 01:28:35.677
THE LIABILITY. AS WELL AS JEFF

01:28:35.743 --> 01:28:37.745
SAID WILL BE ELIMINATED WITHIN A

01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:39.580
COUPLE OF YEARS. I DON'T WANT TO

01:28:39.647 --> 01:28:41.949
GET TOO FAR INTO THE DETAILS IN

01:28:42.016 --> 01:28:45.453
THIS DISCUSSION BUT I ACTUALLY

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:46.020
THINK THERE'S SOME CAUSE FOR

01:28:46.087 --> 01:28:47.155
CONCERN. I WANT TO TAKE. THERE'S

01:28:47.221 --> 01:28:48.990
SOME THING TO BE AWARE ABOUT

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:50.925
WITH THAT AND THAT IS THAT IF

01:28:50.992 --> 01:28:53.594
THE CHARACTERS EIGHT LIABILITY

01:28:53.661 --> 01:28:57.265
DOES BECOME ELIMINATED THE- NUL

01:28:57.331 --> 01:28:59.734
CONTRIBUTION WILL WILL DECLINE

01:28:59.801 --> 01:29:02.537
STATUTORILY. SUCH THAT THEN IN

LIABILITY BECAUSE OF THE MARKET

01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:08.209
DOWNTURN FOR EXAMPLE. WE WILL BE

01:29:08.276 --> 01:29:10.044
CONTRIBUTING POTENTIALLY LESS

01:29:10.111 --> 01:29:12.346
THAN IT NEEDED TO RETIRE THE

01:29:12.413 --> 01:29:14.348
LIABILITY BY THE TWENTY FORTY

01:29:14.415 --> 01:29:18.286
SIX- COOL SO- WE'VE WRITTEN A

01:29:18.352 --> 01:29:20.688
REPORT ABOUT THAT AND- THINK IT

01:29:20.755 --> 01:29:21.723
WARRANTS SOME LEGISLATIVE

01:29:21.789 --> 01:29:24.659

01:29:30.264 --> 01:29:32.834
THING IF IT HAD PUT THOSE

01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:35.870
SYSTEMS ON ON- BETTER FOOTING.

01:29:35.937 --> 01:29:38.106

AND- IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL SO

01:29:46.547 --> 01:29:51.986
THAT'S ALSO VERY FAVORABLE SO-

01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:53.221

I'M NOT SURE BUT IT APPEARS THAT

01:30:14.442 --> 01:30:16.577
WAY. A POINT WAS MADE EARLIER

01:30:16.644 --> 01:30:22.350

COGENERATION. SEEMS TO BE A

01:31:22.810 --> 01:31:25.179
DEAFENING SILENCE ABOUT THAT.

01:31:25.246 --> 01:31:27.782
AND ALSO AS WE DIRECT OUR

01:31:27.849 --> 01:31:29.984
EFFORTS TOWARDS FOREST AND

01:31:30.051 --> 01:31:33.287
WILDLAND MANAGEMENT. I ENCOURAGE

THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE

01:31:34.355 --> 01:31:37.058

TERMS OF DEALING WITH THE

HOMELESS. WE NEED TO BE NOT JUST

01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:26.974

HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH. IT DOESN'T

01:32:47.094 --> 01:32:48.863
SEEM LIKE WE PAID MUCH ATTENTION

01:32:48.930 --> 01:32:49.997
TO THAT IN THE PAST WE'VE

01:32:50.064 --> 01:32:51.899
PROVIDE LIKE IN OUR HOME WAS

01:32:51.966 --> 01:32:55.236
SEPARATE TO THE ABSTRACT ART.

01:32:55.303 --> 01:32:56.837
COME INTO A ROOM WITH A TAKE

01:32:56.904 --> 01:32:58.639
BACK AT THE END JUST START

01:32:58.706 --> 01:33:01.642
SPLASHING ON THE WALLS BUT WE

01:33:01.709 --> 01:33:04.111
REALLY NOT FOCUSED. ON WHAT WILL

01:33:04.178 --> 01:33:06.247
BE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY.

01:33:06.314 --> 01:33:08.182
THE DEAL FOR THE HOMELESS

01:33:08.249 --> 01:33:10.885
POPULATION AS IN IDENTIFYING

01:33:10.952 --> 01:33:12.853
THEIR OTHER NEEDS NOW I

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:15.189
COMPLIMENTED THE GOVERNOR FOR AN

01:33:15.256 --> 01:33:16.991
END TO THE DEPARTMENTS FOR

01:33:17.058 --> 01:33:19.026
STARTING TO FOCUS A LITTLE BIT.

01:33:19.093 --> 01:33:22.029
ON THAT NOW. THAT IT'S MORE THAN

01:33:22.096 --> 01:33:24.098
JUST PROVIDING SHELTER OR AN

01:33:24.165 --> 01:33:27.101
APARTMENT OR A- OFTEN ACQUIRED

01:33:27.168 --> 01:33:30.638
FACILITY- HOLD HOTEL OR MOTEL.

01:33:30.705 --> 01:33:32.540
AT THERE SEEMS TO BE A

01:33:32.606 --> 01:33:33.140
RECOGNITION THAT ARE FOREVER

01:33:33.207 --> 01:33:34.842
GOING TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS

01:33:34.909 --> 01:33:36.777
WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THE

01:33:36.844 --> 01:33:38.846
HOLISTIC ISSUE. OF THE HEALTH

01:33:38.913 --> 01:33:41.115
MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. AND

01:33:41.182 --> 01:33:43.317
THE OTHER ADDICTION NEEDS AND

01:33:43.384 --> 01:33:47.588
SUCH- THIS HOMELESS. POPULATION

01:33:47.655 --> 01:33:49.957
THAT IS I THINK ENCOURAGING TO

01:33:50.024 --> 01:33:51.926
ME IS THIS BUDGET IS

01:33:51.993 --> 01:33:56.063
CONTEMPLATED. I HAVE A GREAT AND

01:33:56.130 --> 01:33:57.231
DEVOTE TODAY OF THE RAINY DAY

01:33:57.298 --> 01:34:01.135
FUND. AND I'D LIKE TO SEE US NOT

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:03.437
. DIMINISH THE IMPORTANCE. OF

01:34:03.504 --> 01:34:06.440
THE RAINY DAY FUND. THAT WAS A

01:34:06.507 --> 01:34:09.744
LONG TIME IN COMING. THE FINDING

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:12.413
OF THE RAINY DAY FUND. IN ONE OF

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:14.115
THE GREAT VALUES OF THE RAINY

01:34:14.181 --> 01:34:16.283
DAY FUND HAS BEEN A BIT OF A

01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:19.920
RESTRAINT ON SPENDING. EFFECTED

01:34:19.987 --> 01:34:22.289
BY TAKING THOSE DOLLARS. WELL

01:34:22.356 --> 01:34:23.557
BEYOND THE REACH OF THE

01:34:23.624 --> 01:34:25.159
LEGISLATURE TO SPEND OR THE

01:34:25.226 --> 01:34:29.830
ADMINISTRATION TO SPEND. ANOTHER

01:34:29.897 --> 01:34:31.599
QUESTION THAT DOES NEED TO BE

01:34:31.665 --> 01:34:34.468
EXAMINED. THIS IS ABOUT THE

01:34:34.535 --> 01:34:36.203
SHORTAGE OF JUDGES. THERE'S

01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:39.407
TREMENDOUS AND I CONSIDERED VERY

01:34:39.473 --> 01:34:41.208
NEGATIVE CHANGES GOING ON IN

01:34:41.275 --> 01:34:42.543
CRIMINAL JUSTICE RIGHT NOW

01:34:42.610 --> 01:34:44.445
RESULTING IN FAR FEWER

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:47.948
PROSECUTIONS. OR USERS OF THE

01:34:48.015 --> 01:34:50.851
COURT REFERENCING HIS

01:34:50.918 --> 01:34:53.554
REHABILITATION I PARTICULARLY

01:34:53.621 --> 01:34:58.993
I'M TALKING HERE ABOUT THE COURT. WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:02.329
THAT. AND IT'S A CURIOSITY TO ME

01:35:02.396 --> 01:35:04.632
THAT WE ARE NOT TAKING A CLOSER

01:35:04.698 --> 01:35:07.234
LOOK AT HIGH SPEED RAIL. THE

01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:09.236
IMMENSE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE

01:35:09.303 --> 01:35:11.605
HAVING TO MAKE TOWARDS THIS HIGH

01:35:11.672 --> 01:35:14.909
SPEED RAIL. THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO

01:35:14.975 --> 01:35:17.411
IN ANY WAY IN THE FUTURE BE

01:35:17.478 --> 01:35:17.945
DIRECTED TOWARDS WHERE THE

01:35:18.012 --> 01:35:21.649
POPULATION IS. AND I THINK THAT

01:35:21.715 --> 01:35:23.250
THAT SHOULD BE EXAMINED VERY

01:35:23.317 --> 01:35:29.423
THOROUGHLY. IN THIS BUDGET. THE

01:35:29.490 --> 01:35:33.527
SCREWED ME OF THE BUDGET AND THE

01:35:33.594 --> 01:35:35.896
OVERSIGHT. ABILITIES OF THE

01:35:35.963 --> 01:35:37.298
LEGISLATION THROUGH THE BUDGET

01:35:37.364 --> 01:35:39.066
COMMITTEE I WANT TO COMPLIMENT

01:35:39.133 --> 01:35:41.268
THE LEGISLATURE PUT TO THE

01:35:41.335 --> 01:35:42.570
SENATE FOR THE LAST SEVERAL

01:35:42.636 --> 01:35:45.206
YEARS OF ACCEPTING A GREATER

01:35:45.272 --> 01:35:47.508
ROLE IN OVERSIGHT. OF THE

01:35:47.575 --> 01:35:52.480
AGENCIES IN DEPTH OVERSIGHT. IN

01:35:52.546 --> 01:35:54.715
CHANGING HOW THE AGENCIES THE

01:35:54.782 --> 01:35:59.320
BUSINESS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:35:59.386 --> 01:35:59.920
THIS ADMINISTRATION SEEMS TO

01:35:59.987 --> 01:36:02.223
HAVE A PROCLIVITY TO IS TO FORM

01:36:02.289 --> 01:36:04.558
A NEW AGENCIES ALBEIT MAYBE

01:36:04.625 --> 01:36:08.429
SMALLER ONES. BUT THERE SEEMS TO

01:36:08.496 --> 01:36:11.665
BE A PROLIFERATION. ALMOST ALL

01:36:11.732 --> 01:36:14.168
OF THESE WILL BUILD THE BASE. OF

01:36:14.235 --> 01:36:16.770
OUR BUDGETS IN THE FUTURE.

01:36:16.837 --> 01:36:18.973
TRADING EXPECTATIONS IN

01:36:19.039 --> 01:36:24.245

HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT

01:36:54.275 --> 01:36:55.776
WILL BE OBVIOUSLY HAVING

01:36:55.843 --> 01:36:58.145
HEARINGS ON A LOT OF THIS- BUT I

01:36:58.212 --> 01:37:01.615
REALLY WANT TO THINK- BOTH THAT-

01:37:01.682 --> 01:37:03.184
FINANCE AND THE LA- FOR THE

01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:05.553
DETAILED INFORMATION- I

01:37:05.619 --> 01:37:07.388
APPRECIATE THE NEED FOR

01:37:07.454 --> 01:37:09.924
OVERSIGHT M. IN NEW PROGRAMS I

01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:14.228
FEEL- THAT THE PROGRAM'S ROLLOUT

01:37:14.295 --> 01:37:14.995
DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT PARTS

01:37:15.062 --> 01:37:17.464
OF THE STATE. AND THEY CREATE

01:37:17.531 --> 01:37:19.266
SOME EQUITY ISSUES AND I WANT TO

01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:22.703
MAKE SURE THAT AS WE- CONTINUE

01:37:22.770 --> 01:37:23.904
TO FUND THESE PROGRAMS THAT WE

01:37:23.971 --> 01:37:25.105
KNOW THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING

01:37:25.172 --> 01:37:26.740
TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THE

01:37:26.807 --> 01:37:29.310
HELP AND THAT. ALL COMMUNITIES

01:37:29.376 --> 01:37:30.978
SHARE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS

01:37:31.045 --> 01:37:33.781
THOSE FUNDS- AND I'M SPEAKING

01:37:33.847 --> 01:37:36.183
OBVIOUSLY OF THE RURAL- ISOLATED

01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:37.718
COMMUNITIES REALLY HAVE A HARD

01:37:37.785 --> 01:37:39.253
TIME ACCESSING SOME OF THESE

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:41.222
RESOURCES BECAUSE OF THAT-

01:37:41.288 --> 01:37:42.890
CIRCUMSTANCES AND HOW THEY WERE

01:37:42.957 --> 01:37:45.226
SET UP. AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:37:45.292 --> 01:37:47.061
CAUTION ABOUT NOT STARTING ANY

01:37:47.127 --> 01:37:49.897
NEW PROGRAMS AND UNTIL WE KNOW-

01:37:49.964 --> 01:37:52.132
IF THE NEW MONEY THAT WE PUT ON

01:37:52.199 --> 01:37:54.435
THE TABLE LAST YEAR IS- ACTUALLY

01:37:54.501 --> 01:37:56.003
WORKING TO SOLVE SOME OF THE

01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:58.405
PROBLEMS THAT. THAT WE HAVE

01:37:58.472 --> 01:38:03.611
IDENTIFIED NEED TO BE ARMED. A

01:38:03.677 --> 01:38:05.679
SOFT AND- AND I JUST HAVE TO SAY

01:38:05.746 --> 01:38:07.081
THAT I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED

01:38:07.147 --> 01:38:09.450
ABOUT THE CONTINUED TRYING TO

01:38:09.516 --> 01:38:10.117
CREATE NEW DEPARTMENTS BOARDS OR

01:38:10.184 --> 01:38:12.653
DIVISIONS- IN BUDGET TRAILER

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:14.521
BILL LANGUAGE INSTEAD OF PUTTING

01:38:14.588 --> 01:38:15.889
THEM THROUGH THE POLICY

01:38:15.956 --> 01:38:17.591
COMMITTEES IS BUILT. ON SO I'M

01:38:17.658 --> 01:38:19.026
GONNA LOOK AT THAT PRETTY

01:38:19.093 --> 01:38:20.694
CAREFULLY PART OF THE CHALLENGES

01:38:20.761 --> 01:38:21.929
THEN WE DON'T KNOW REALLY HOW

01:38:21.996 --> 01:38:23.897
THE PROGRAMS ARE GONNA ROLL OUT.

01:38:23.964 --> 01:38:24.932
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD AN

01:38:24.999 --> 01:38:26.600
OPPORTUNITY TO CHALLENGE THEM IN

01:38:26.667 --> 01:38:28.369
POLICY COMMITTEES. I WANT TO

01:38:28.435 --> 01:38:30.070
MAKE SURE THAT THAT THEY

01:38:30.137 --> 01:38:31.672
ACTUALLY ARE ARE GOING TO WORK

01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:33.007
ONE A SECOND WHAT WAS JUST SAID

01:38:33.073 --> 01:38:35.175
ABOUT THE RAINY DAY FUND I THINK

01:38:35.242 --> 01:38:36.043
THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:39.480
ELEMENT IN OUR BUDGET AND- BOTH

01:38:39.546 --> 01:38:41.515
OF THE LEARNING CENTER AND I

01:38:41.582 --> 01:38:43.951
WERE AROUND DURING THE TIME THAT

01:38:44.018 --> 01:38:45.919
WE MADE SOME OF THE WORST BUDGET

01:38:45.986 --> 01:38:48.355
CUTS IN OUR- THE STATE'S HISTORY

01:38:48.422 --> 01:38:50.491
AND- WE'RE PAINFULLY AWARE THE

01:38:50.557 --> 01:38:51.825
FACT THAT WE DON'T WANT TO GO

01:38:51.892 --> 01:38:53.827
BACK TO THOSE DAYS- CLEARLY OUR

01:38:53.894 --> 01:38:55.162
INVESTMENTS ARE DOING WELL.

01:38:55.229 --> 01:38:56.997
BECAUSE INVESTMENTS IN THE STOCK

01:38:57.064 --> 01:38:59.166
MARKET ARE DOING WELL OVERALL.

01:38:59.233 --> 01:39:00.868
AND THAT'S A GOOD THING FOR OUR

01:39:00.934 --> 01:39:03.437
BUDGET BUT WHEN- THE ECONOMY

01:39:03.504 --> 01:39:05.773
SOFTENS THAT'S WHEN WE START TO

01:39:05.839 --> 01:39:06.774
SEPARATE WE'RE GONNA NEED-

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.876
THOSE. THOSE RESOURCES I ALSO

01:39:08.942 --> 01:39:10.978
WANNA. ONE OF THE FOOTNOTES I

01:39:11.045 --> 01:39:12.980
WANT TO SAY ON ON THAT CREATING

01:39:13.047 --> 01:39:17.051
NEW PROGRAMS AND- AND- AND THE

01:39:17.117 --> 01:39:18.986
CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT IN THE

01:39:19.053 --> 01:39:20.654
AREA OF HOUSING- I THINK THERE'S

01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:23.357
SOME REAL NEED FOR- SOME

01:39:23.424 --> 01:39:25.159
OVERSIGHT HEARINGS. IN TERMS OF

01:39:25.225 --> 01:39:26.660
THE RESOURCES THAT ARE ROLLING

01:39:26.727 --> 01:39:32.800
OUT- AND A REAL. UNDERSTANDING

01:39:32.866 --> 01:39:35.869
OF HOW WE'RE DOING IN TERMS OF

01:39:35.936 --> 01:39:39.573
COMBATING HOMELESSNESS- WE PUT A

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:41.342
LOT OF MONEY OUT AND I'M NT

01:39:41.408 --> 01:39:43.377
SURE WE'RE SEEING THE RESULTS OF

01:39:43.444 --> 01:39:45.212
IT I'D LIKE TO HEAR THAT WE ARE

01:39:45.279 --> 01:39:46.780
BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN IT IN THE

01:39:46.847 --> 01:39:49.183
COMMUNITIES THAT I VISITED. AND

01:39:49.249 --> 01:39:50.918
MANY OF THE SMALL RURAL

01:39:50.984 --> 01:39:52.086
COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN NOT ABLE

01:39:52.152 --> 01:39:55.422
TO ACCESS RESOURCES IN TO HELP

01:39:55.489 --> 01:39:56.790
THEM WITH THEIR HOMELESS PROBLEM

01:39:56.857 --> 01:39:58.492
AND FEEL LIKE THEY'VE BEEN LEFT

01:39:58.559 --> 01:40:00.794
OUT OF THE GAME AND NUMBER ONE

01:40:00.861 --> 01:40:02.996
AND NUMBER TWO IS ANYTIME WE

01:40:03.063 --> 01:40:05.032
INVEST MONEY IN DOWNTOWN M.

01:40:05.099 --> 01:40:08.469
INFILL. THE PROJECTS WERE GOING

01:40:08.535 --> 01:40:12.606
TO GO ABOVE. TWO STORIES THE-

01:40:12.673 --> 01:40:13.941
COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE

01:40:14.007 --> 01:40:17.177
ROBUST. PUBLIC SAFETY EQUIPMENT.

01:40:17.244 --> 01:40:19.313
REQUIRE NEW PUMPER TRUCKS AND SO

01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:21.248
THEY'RE CONSTRAINED TO ONLY

01:40:21.315 --> 01:40:23.684
BUILD UP TO TWO STORIES INSTEAD

01:40:23.751 --> 01:40:25.753
OF GOING HIGHER AND I THINK. SO

01:40:25.819 --> 01:40:27.588
AS A CONSEQUENCE ARE NOT ABLE TO

01:40:27.654 --> 01:40:28.956
ACCESS THE FUNDS MY POINT AND

01:40:29.022 --> 01:40:31.558
ALL OF THAT IS THAT WE HAVE SOME

01:40:31.625 --> 01:40:33.026
BARRIERS. AND I'M NOT SURE WE'RE

01:40:33.093 --> 01:40:34.128
TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION HOW TO

01:40:34.194 --> 01:40:35.729
GET AROUND THOSE BARRIERS ARE

01:40:35.796 --> 01:40:37.965
HOW TO SOLVE THEM. AND THAT'S

01:40:38.031 --> 01:40:40.300
THE- PURPOSE OF HAVING POLICY

01:40:40.367 --> 01:40:44.371
COMMITTEES. THAT CAN INVITE.

01:40:44.438 --> 01:40:46.206
INFORMATION FROM OUR OUR

01:40:46.273 --> 01:40:47.708
PARTNERS THE CITIES AND THE

01:40:47.775 --> 01:40:49.676
COUNTIES AND WE CAN DO IT RIGHT

01:40:49.743 --> 01:40:51.044
AND THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENT

01:40:51.111 --> 01:40:52.980
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANAGER.
