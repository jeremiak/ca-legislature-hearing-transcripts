THOSE GRADUATING IN THAT YEAR.

00:29:14.185 --> 00:29:15.753
FOR ETHNIC STUDIES TO BE

DOING WHAT IT IS SET OUT TO DO.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.762
IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE HAVE THE

AS I LEARNED IN STUDENT TEACHING

00:29:42.847 --> 00:29:43.948
YOU CAN'T TEACH WHAT YOU DON'T

00:29:44.015 --> 00:29:47.552

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:50.722
HEARING IS TO FIND OUT WHAT IS

00:29:50.788 --> 00:29:54.526

REQUIREMENT. WE KNOW THE POWER

00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:06.471
OF ETHNIC STUDIES WE HAVE SEEN

00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:09.107

AMERICAN STUDIES TRANSFORM

00:30:20.185 --> 00:30:23.955
STUDENTS. BUT IT DOES SO WHEN

00:30:24.022 --> 00:30:25.723
THE TEACHER IN THE CLASSROOM

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:28.560
BELIEVES IN WHAT HE OR SHE IS

00:30:28.626 --> 00:30:32.363
DOING. AND HAS THE KNOWLEDGE A

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:35.466
TO TEACH THAT CLASS AND WE ALSO

00:30:35.533 --> 00:30:36.501

IN THE THERE WAS A INSTRUCTOR

00:32:35.987 --> 00:32:37.188
WHO TOOK THE TIME TO SHOW ME

00:32:37.255 --> 00:32:38.323
THAT THERE WAS A DIFFERENT

00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:40.191
HISTORY- TO WHO MY PEOPLE WERE

BECAME EMPOWER. I CAN'T

00:32:44.896 --> 00:32:46.597
CHANGER IT IS TO HAVE ETHNIC

00:32:46.664 --> 00:32:49.434

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.102
SAT IN THE FRONT WAYS BUT THE

00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:52.603
ABILITY TO DO THIS IN HIGH

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.839
SCHOOL DETERMINES OUR ABILITY TO

00:32:56.507 --> 00:32:58.242
COLLEGE WILL OUR CAREER PATHS

00:32:58.309 --> 00:32:59.744
WHAT WE CONTRIBUTE BACKTRACKING

00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:01.045
MEANS NOT TO SAY THAT WE DON'T

00:33:01.112 --> 00:33:03.147
IF WE DON'T DO THIS. BUT I THINK

00:33:03.214 --> 00:33:04.282
IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT

00:33:04.349 --> 00:33:06.384
WE HAVE ETHNIC STUDIES AND THAT

00:33:06.451 --> 00:33:08.186
IS A REQUIREMENT THAT DAY AND

00:33:08.252 --> 00:33:10.288
THAT WE GET EMPOWERMENT FROM THE

00:33:10.355 --> 00:33:12.890
PEOPLE WHO WE ARE OUR HISTORY IN

00:33:12.957 --> 00:33:15.159
WHO WE BECOME OUR CULTURE. THAT

00:33:15.226 --> 00:33:17.395
AIM KEY TO THAT IS GOING TO HAVE

00:33:17.462 --> 00:33:19.397
THE INSTRUCTOR SO I LOOK FORWARD

00:33:19.464 --> 00:33:20.465

WAS BRAGGING- HOW OUR SOUTH

00:34:53.691 --> 00:34:57.428
KOREA WAS A MADE UP OF LAW. IT

00:34:57.495 --> 00:35:01.265
DOES SO WITHOUT- ONE PEOPLE. AND

00:35:01.332 --> 00:35:05.703
NOW- THE SITUATION IS-CHANGING

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:08.506
I THINK GOAL OVER THE WORD-

00:35:08.573 --> 00:35:12.009
ECONOMY REQUIRES- PAPER TO MOVE

00:35:12.076 --> 00:35:14.879
AROUND. NOW MANY DIFFERENT

00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:17.348
ETHNIC GROUPS ARE ARE MOVING TO

00:35:17.415 --> 00:35:23.287
KOREA- AND- THEY BECOME A GOOD

00:35:23.354 --> 00:35:25.523
WORKFORCE. HAVING IMMIGRATED TO

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:31.128
THIS COUNTRY- IN MY ADULT LIFE-

00:35:31.195 --> 00:35:33.498
I SUDDENLY- I FOUND A DIFFERENT

00:35:33.564 --> 00:35:36.834
WORD. THIS COUNTRY WAS- KNOCKED

00:35:36.901 --> 00:35:39.837
OUT MONO ETHNIC COUNTRY MADE UP

00:35:39.904 --> 00:35:43.741
OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT- PEOPLE

00:35:43.808 --> 00:35:44.675
WITH A DIFFERENT ETHNIC

00:35:44.742 --> 00:35:47.979
BACKGROUND AND LANGUAGE BACK ON

00:35:48.045 --> 00:35:50.314
THE COUCH OR BACKGROUND. AND

00:35:50.381 --> 00:35:53.684
UNFORTUNATELY THIS COUNTRY HAD

00:35:53.751 --> 00:35:56.287
TO GO THROUGH- IN TONER-

00:35:56.354 --> 00:35:59.690
PROCESS- THROUGH A CIVIL WAR AND

00:35:59.757 --> 00:36:02.226
THE STEELERS CB IT RIGHT SO ARE

00:36:02.293 --> 00:36:04.929
NOT TOTALLY- A RESULT THE

00:36:04.996 --> 00:36:08.699
MATTERS IT I THINK A CELLPHONE.

00:36:08.766 --> 00:36:11.502
ISSUE AND THE MANY- SOCIAL

00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:14.972
PROBLEMS ARE BEING PRESENTED TO-

00:36:15.039 --> 00:36:18.643
ISSUE WE HAVE SEEN IT FOR NO

00:36:18.709 --> 00:36:20.978
REASON THE YEARS. AND EVEN

00:36:21.045 --> 00:36:24.181
THOUGH- KOREAN COMMUNITY HAVE%

00:36:24.248 --> 00:36:27.084
SUFFERED. I THINK BUSINESSES-

00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:31.556
HAVE A SEPARATE THEM MOST- FOR

00:36:31.622 --> 00:36:34.292
VARIOUS REASONS NOW DURIG THE

00:36:34.358 --> 00:36:37.295
LA RIOTS. AND THE NAM OF KOREAN

00:36:37.361 --> 00:36:40.197
COMMUNITY IS SO REALIZING THAT

00:36:40.264 --> 00:36:45.336
THE HOW WE CAN- EXPO- SO OF A

00:36:45.403 --> 00:36:47.872
KOREAN PEOPLE TO BOTH THE-

00:36:47.939 --> 00:36:50.241
DIFFERENT NOT GROUPS OF PEOPLE

00:36:50.308 --> 00:36:52.777
AND TO CREATE THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:36:52.843 --> 00:36:55.580
IN OUR COMMUNITY MORE ARE

00:36:55.646 --> 00:36:59.617
AVAILABLE OUR COMMUNITY IN PEACE

00:36:59.684 --> 00:37:02.253
AND HARMONY OR THE DIFFERENT

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.256
ETHNIC GROUPS. AND A TEACHING

00:37:05.323 --> 00:37:06.223
OUR DIFFERENCES IN THE

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:09.060
BACKGROUND- THROUGH THE HIGH

00:37:09.126 --> 00:37:13.197
SCHOOL. AND THE- I THINK THIS IS

00:37:13.264 --> 00:37:15.199
A EXCELLENT IDEA BUT IT'LL BE A

00:37:15.266 --> 00:37:17.268
LOT OF WHAT CHALLENGES BECAUSE

00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:20.304
THIS IS A NOT ONE TWO OR THREE

00:37:20.371 --> 00:37:22.173
OR FOUR DIFFERENT KINDS OF-

00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:25.743
ETHNIC ETHNICITY WE ARE DEALING

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:29.313
WITH THAT. I BET. INTERVIEW OVER

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:30.414
ONE HUNDRED DIFFERENT KINDS SELF

00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:34.151
LAW A DIFFERENT CULTURES AND A-

00:37:34.218 --> 00:37:36.787
ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS- BECAUSE I DO

00:37:36.854 --> 00:37:38.889
KNOW THAT THAT. COMING FROM CITY

00:37:38.956 --> 00:37:41.525
OF IRVINE- EVEN THOUGH IT

00:37:41.592 --> 00:37:44.295
APPEARS TO BE A WHITE COMMUNITY

00:37:44.362 --> 00:37:47.498
IN FACT- IT IS NOT THE WHEN

00:37:47.565 --> 00:37:48.866
IRVINE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:37:48.933 --> 00:37:51.702
I. HAVE DONE- SURVEY AND THEN I

00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:54.138
THINK THAT THEY UPDATE THAT THE

00:37:54.205 --> 00:37:56.107
SURVEY CONTINUES TO THE- WHAT

00:37:56.173 --> 00:37:57.842
THE MOTHER LANGUAGES DO YOU

00:37:57.908 --> 00:38:00.077
SPEAK AT HOME. THAT IS A VERY

00:38:00.144 --> 00:38:01.979
IMPORTANT QUESTION AND I THINK

00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:04.849
IT'S A NEARLY SEVENTY DIFFERENT

00:38:04.915 --> 00:38:07.618
LANGUAGES ARE BEING SPOKEN AT

00:38:07.685 --> 00:38:09.520
HOMES. YOU CAN SEE OF THE

00:38:09.587 --> 00:38:12.990
WORKABLE CULTURES AND ETHNIC

00:38:13.057 --> 00:38:14.425
BACKGROUND. THE S. C. IS A MADE

00:38:14.492 --> 00:38:17.294
UP. THINK OF WHAT THE UNITED

00:38:17.361 --> 00:38:19.163
STATES THINK OF THE STATE OF

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.365
CALIFORNIA HOW MANY DIFFERENT

00:38:21.432 --> 00:38:23.668
CULTURES SO WE ARE DEALING WITH

00:38:23.734 --> 00:38:26.570
WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE ARE LIVING

00:38:26.637 --> 00:38:28.172
IN THE STATE. SO EXPECT TO SEE

00:38:28.239 --> 00:38:30.641
DIFFERENT THIS KIND OF WHAT

00:38:30.708 --> 00:38:34.412
DIFFERENCE IS- AND THOUGH FOR

00:38:34.478 --> 00:38:35.913
THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.048
BACKGROUND THAT THEIR

00:38:37.114 --> 00:38:39.083
CONTRIBUTION IN THIS COUNTRY AND

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:41.018
THAT OUR DIFFERENCES AND THEN

00:38:41.085 --> 00:38:43.087
ALSO BEAUTIFUL CULTURES THAT

00:38:43.154 --> 00:38:46.323
THEY BRING IN IN EARLY HF DURING

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:49.760
THE HIGH SCHOOL TIME SO HOW WE

00:38:49.827 --> 00:38:52.863
CAN SEGMENT WITH A THERAPY ONE

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:56.033
SEMESTER ONE NEAR WE NEED TO

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.535
FIGURE THAT OUT THAT AND THE

00:38:57.601 --> 00:38:59.437
WHAT PORTION HOW WE CAN SLICE

00:38:59.503 --> 00:39:03.340
THE TIME. AND THE TEACH ENOUGH-

00:39:03.407 --> 00:39:07.178
CURRICULUM- ENOUGH THE CONTENT

00:39:07.244 --> 00:39:09.080
BELONGING TO THAT THE PARTICULAR

00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:12.616
ISSUES BECAUSE I DO SEE HERE

00:39:12.683 --> 00:39:14.852
WHAT IS ETHNIC STUDIES STUFF FOR

00:39:14.919 --> 00:39:16.921
FUNDAMENTAL DISCIPLINES OF

00:39:16.987 --> 00:39:19.457
AFRICAN AMERICAN BACKGROUND-

00:39:19.523 --> 00:39:21.158

FILIPINOS NATIVE AMERICANS ASIAN

00:43:09.486 --> 00:43:11.622
WHATEVER. THEY CAN THEY CAN IN

00:43:11.689 --> 00:43:15.426
ALL FIELDS AND EXPERIENCE SO

00:43:15.492 --> 00:43:16.794
THAT THE WHEN THEY UNDERSTAND

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.629
THE MOST LIKELY THEY WOULD

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:20.531
BECOME A FRIEND SAYS THAT'S THE

00:43:20.597 --> 00:43:22.366
REASON IT IS BUT THIS YEAR WE

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:24.535

FOR ELEVEN THIRTY YEARS

00:43:28.372 --> 00:43:31.308
CELEBRATION I THINK THAT IS- AN

00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:34.311
EXAMPLE I WANT TO INTRODUCE SO

00:43:34.378 --> 00:43:37.581
HOPEFULLY THIS ETHNIC STUDIES WE

00:43:37.648 --> 00:43:40.317
EXPLORED. ALL DIFFERENT KINDS

00:43:40.384 --> 00:43:41.986
SHOULD ANSWER. DIFFERENT

00:43:42.052 --> 00:43:45.356
CULTURES SO I THINK THIS IS A

00:43:45.422 --> 00:43:46.724
HEALTHY WEIGHT- ARE SO

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:48.359
REPUBLICAN IT WAS A VERY

00:43:48.425 --> 00:43:51.061
DIFFICULT. FOR ME TO VOTE ON

00:43:51.128 --> 00:43:53.297
THAT I THINK I BELIEVE I WAS THE

00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:55.566
ONLY REPUBLICAN DEFYING THE

00:43:55.632 --> 00:43:58.402

ON. SO I THINK THROUGH THE KIND

00:44:26.363 --> 00:44:28.532
OF A HEARING CAN CUT. AND- BUT

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:30.434

FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSIONS THAT

00:44:53.223 --> 00:44:54.992
WE'RE HAVING TODAY- ETHNIC

00:44:55.059 --> 00:44:56.994
CITIES IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT-

00:44:57.061 --> 00:45:01.131
AS MY COLLEAGUE- MIGUEL SANTIAGO

00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:02.299
MENTIONED YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE

00:45:02.366 --> 00:45:04.468
THIS IN SCHOOLS GROWING UP HERE

00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:06.437
IN CALIFORNIA AND I WAS LUCKY

00:45:06.503 --> 00:45:10.507
THAT I HAD A PARENT WHO- IS VERY

00:45:10.574 --> 00:45:12.876
FAMILIAR AND AFRICAN AMERICAN

00:45:12.943 --> 00:45:15.279
HISTORY- AND SO THAT SHE COULD

00:45:15.345 --> 00:45:17.181
IMPART THAT KNOWLEDGE ON ME AND

00:45:17.247 --> 00:45:18.782
MY BROTHERS BUT YOU KNOW NOW

00:45:18.849 --> 00:45:20.117
THAT I HAVE TWO LITTLE ONES OF

00:45:20.184 --> 00:45:21.919
MY OWN AND THAT'S NOT MY

00:45:21.985 --> 00:45:23.220
BACKGROUND BUT I'M TRYING TO

00:45:23.287 --> 00:45:24.955
TEACH THEM ABOUT OUR HISTORY.

00:45:25.022 --> 00:45:26.690
IT'S NOT AS EASY AS ONE WOULD

00:45:26.757 --> 00:45:28.492
THINK AND SO IS EXTREMELY

00:45:28.559 --> 00:45:30.127
IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT ONLY HAVE

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:31.562
THIS IN THEIR IN THEIR

00:45:31.628 --> 00:45:33.030
CURRICULUM THAT WE DO IT RIGHT

00:45:33.097 --> 00:45:34.264
AND WE MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:45:34.331 --> 00:45:36.500
TEACHERS THAT ARE TEACHING THIS

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:38.569
ARE EDUCATED THEMSELVES THAT WE

00:45:38.635 --> 00:45:40.471
DON'T JUST SAY REGULAR SCIENCE

00:45:40.537 --> 00:45:42.206
INSTRUCTOR CAN REGULAR HISTORY

00:45:42.272 --> 00:45:44.041
INSTRUCTOR CAN DO IT YOU MUST

00:45:44.108 --> 00:45:45.876
UNDERSTAND ETHNIC STUDIES MUST

00:45:45.943 --> 00:45:48.145
UNDERSTAND THE NUANCES SO THAT

00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:50.180
YOU CAN TEACH IT TO THE STUDENTS

00:45:50.247 --> 00:45:51.782
BUT ALSO TO THE OTHER TEACHER-

00:45:51.849 --> 00:45:53.450
IT DOES HELP DEVELOP A SENSE OF

00:45:53.517 --> 00:45:55.119
APPRECIATION AND RESPECT AND I

00:45:55.185 --> 00:45:56.553
REMEMBER GROWING UP. YOU KNOW

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:59.523
THERE WAS THIS- BELIEVE THAT YOU

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:00.724
KNOW BLACK PEOPLE JUST WEREN'T

00:46:00.791 --> 00:46:02.526
GOOD IN MATH YOU KNOW BLACK KIDS

00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:03.560
JUST AREN'T GOOD IN MATH AND

00:46:03.627 --> 00:46:05.262
SCIENCE BUT THEN WHEN WE LOOK AT

00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:07.397
OUR HISTORY AND WE LEARN ABOUT

00:46:07.464 --> 00:46:08.832
PEOPLE LIKE KATHERINE JOHNSON

00:46:08.899 --> 00:46:09.466
AND REALIZE THAT WE WOULD NOT

00:46:09.533 --> 00:46:11.835
HAVE GONE TO THE MOON HAD IT NOT

00:46:11.902 --> 00:46:14.071
BEEN FOR. BOOKS MATHEMATICIANS

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:17.174
JUST OF HOW MANY FOR TWENTY WE

00:46:17.241 --> 00:46:20.077
CAN HAVE NEW THAT AND WE WEREN'T

00:46:20.144 --> 00:46:21.979
AT THAT TIME STEREO TYPE PRINT

00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:24.681
ORDER YOU KNOW PUT A BOX AROUND

00:46:24.748 --> 00:46:27.084

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.122
UP LEARNING ALLOWS FOR TOLERANCE

00:46:32.189 --> 00:46:34.591

01:13:28.137 --> 01:13:29.972
MISSED TO BE REPRESENTED AND

01:13:30.038 --> 01:13:32.241
THAT- THE THIRD IS AN ETHNIC

01:13:32.307 --> 01:13:33.342
STUDIES COURSE TAUGHT AS PART OF

01:13:33.408 --> 01:13:35.778
A COURSE THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:38.947
AS MEDIATED G. REQUIREMENTS- AND

01:13:39.014 --> 01:13:40.582
THEN THE FOURTH IS A LOCALLY

01:13:40.649 --> 01:13:42.117
DEVELOPED ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE

01:13:42.184 --> 01:13:43.552
APPROVED BY THE GOVERNING BOARD

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:45.487
OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. FOR THE

01:13:45.554 --> 01:13:46.955
GOVERNING BODY OF THE CHARTER

01:13:47.022 --> 01:13:50.225
SCHOOL NOW CURRICULUM ITSELF

01:13:50.292 --> 01:13:52.060
ENCOURAGES SCHOOLS TO INCLUDE

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:54.963
DESCRIPTIONS ON. THAT MAKE YOUR

01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:56.365
ATTENTION BECAUSE HE'S OF

01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:57.266
STUDENTS WITHIN THEIR

01:13:57.332 --> 01:14:03.005
COMMUNITIES. AND FOUR MAIN

01:14:03.071 --> 01:14:04.673
GROUPS- THAT WAY CHIR CHOI HAD

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:07.009
JUST- THERE ARE SIX OF THE

01:14:07.075 --> 01:14:10.445
ETHNIC SAID MODEL. THANK INTO-

01:14:10.512 --> 01:14:12.414
OTHER- ANOTHER DRIVER

01:14:12.481 --> 01:14:14.683
POPULATIONS BEYOND THOSE FOUR

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:16.652
YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THE

01:14:16.718 --> 01:14:18.921
POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE. AND I

01:14:18.987 --> 01:14:20.889
THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT IS

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:22.958
THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AFTER

01:14:23.025 --> 01:14:26.795
LONG DISCUSSION MANY YEARS- YOU

01:14:26.862 --> 01:14:28.397
KNOW THAT THAT THAT WHAT ETHNIC

01:14:28.463 --> 01:14:32.034
STUDIES IS THE STUDY. OF

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:34.169
HISTORICAL GROUPS THAT HAVE

01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:36.405
POPULATED THE UNITED STATES IN

01:14:36.471 --> 01:14:38.774
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND I

01:14:38.841 --> 01:14:40.209
UNDERSTOOD THAT IF IT WILL

01:14:40.275 --> 01:14:41.810
DISTRICT DECIDED TO OFFER A

01:14:41.877 --> 01:14:44.046
CLASS IN STATE NATIVE AMERICAN

01:14:44.112 --> 01:14:45.480
STUDIES OR ASIAN AMERICAN

01:14:45.547 --> 01:14:48.650
STUDIES. A STANDALONE CLASS THAT

01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:50.719
CLASS WOULD- FULFILL THE

01:14:50.786 --> 01:14:52.955
REQUIREMENTS BUT I'M TRYING TO

01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:55.157
MAKE THE POINT THAT I DO NOT

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:56.058
THINK. THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT IT

01:14:56.124 --> 01:14:59.061
AS- A GIVEN THE FLEXIBILITY OF

01:14:59.127 --> 01:15:00.696
SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO SAY WELL

01:15:00.762 --> 01:15:03.031
THIS GROUP OR THAT GROUP

01:15:03.098 --> 01:15:05.234
ESPECIALLY ONE OF THOSE FOR A

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:08.270
GROUP. AT THE- MEDIA. HE

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:09.104
PRESENTED THAT THE JUST THE

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:11.773
POINT I WANTED TO MAKE- I HAVE A

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.777
QUESTION TO- I THINK. OF MR

01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:17.546
DWYER FROM DIRECTOR OF

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:21.049
PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. DID I. I

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:22.784
I'VE HEARD YOU SAY THE NUMBER OF

01:15:22.851 --> 01:15:26.021
SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHERS THAT THE CREDENTIAL IN THE STATE

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:28.690
OF CALIFORNIA WOOD BURKE. YOU'RE

01:15:28.757 --> 01:15:30.759
NOT IMPLYING THAT ALL THOSE

01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:32.728
SOCIAL STUDIES. TEACHERS HAVE

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:35.397
THE KNOWLEDGE OR CAPABILITY OF

01:15:35.464 --> 01:15:37.966
TEACHING ETHNIC STUDIES. IS THAT

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:42.771
CORRECT. SO CRYSTALS THAT I

01:15:42.838 --> 01:15:45.240
BELIEVE ALMOST FORTY SEVEN

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:46.708
THOUSAND EIGHT YOU KNOW IT'S

01:15:46.775 --> 01:15:50.412
REALLY KIND OF DIFFICULT TO HEAR

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:52.814
. I'M HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:54.983
. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW BETTER.

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:57.052
OKAY I'M DIRECTORS WHO WILL

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:59.788
TESTIFY THAT IT'S ALMOST FORTY

01:15:59.855 --> 01:16:00.989
SEVEN THOUSAND TEACHERS WHO HOLD

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:04.493
THE- SOCIAL STUDIES SINGLE

01:16:04.559 --> 01:16:06.061
SUBJECT OUR CREDENTIALS. WE DO

01:16:06.128 --> 01:16:08.297
BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE IT IS SUCH

01:16:08.363 --> 01:16:12.167
A BROAD BASED CREDENTIAL THAT-

01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:15.637
THE TEACHERS ARE PREPARED TO.

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:18.173
TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES HOWEVER

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:21.109
BECAUSE EACH DISTRICT OR EACH

01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:23.545
CHARTER SCHOOL WILL BE-

01:16:23.612 --> 01:16:25.781
DEVELOPING THEIR OWN CURRICULUM

01:16:25.847 --> 01:16:26.715
THERE IS LIKELY ADDITIONAL

01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:28.750
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT

01:16:28.817 --> 01:16:32.054
WILL BE NEEDED FOR TEACHERS. IN

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:35.490
MANY OR MOST DISTRICTS. SO IF A

01:16:35.557 --> 01:16:38.160
TEACHER WHO TEACHES A PHYSICS

01:16:38.226 --> 01:16:42.564
AND A HIGH SCHOOL- HAS A SCIENCE

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:45.767
CREDENTIAL IS THAT CORRECT. YEAH

01:16:45.834 --> 01:16:47.202
RIGHT I HAVE TAUGHT IN HIGH

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:49.438
SCHOOL SO IT IF I'M A PHYSICS

01:16:49.504 --> 01:16:52.107
TEACHER AT MY HIGH SCHOOL AND I

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:54.443
HAVE A SCIENCE CREDENTIAL. DOES

01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:57.813
THAT MAKE ME- QUALIFIED. TO

01:16:57.879 --> 01:17:00.115
TEACH CHEMISTRY AT THE SAME HIGH

01:17:00.182 --> 01:17:01.650
SCHOOL AND MAYBE THE CREDENTIAL

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:04.252
IS. MAYBE THE SCIENCE CREDENZA.

01:17:04.319 --> 01:17:06.755
MAKES ME QUALIFIED BUT IF I AM

01:17:06.822 --> 01:17:08.924
THE PRINCIPLE OF THAT HIGH

01:17:08.991 --> 01:17:11.693
SCHOOL DO I NECESSARILY WANT. A

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.262
PHYSICS TEACHER TO TEACH BIOLOGY

01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:17.132
IF THEY'RE QUALIFIED YES BUT IF

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:18.266
THEY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF

01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:21.937
BIOLOGY- WHAT I WANT. THE

01:17:22.004 --> 01:17:23.538
PHYSICS TEACHER TEACHING THAT

01:17:23.605 --> 01:17:29.678
CLASS. OR IF I TEACH CALCULUS.

01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:32.080
AT I'M A MATH TEACHER AND I'M

01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:34.750
TEACHING CALCULUS DOES THAT MAKE

01:17:34.816 --> 01:17:38.153
ME QUALIFIED TO TEACH CHEMISTRY

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:40.088
. LITTLE UNDER ASK MY COLLEAGUE

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:43.525
AARON TO TALK MORE ABOUT- WHAT

01:17:43.592 --> 01:17:46.828
TEACHERS ARE ALLOWED TO TEACH-

01:17:46.895 --> 01:17:48.397
BECAUSE THAT'S FOR HER DIVISION

01:17:48.463 --> 01:17:51.733
YOU CANNOT I I'M- I'M GONNA

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:54.770
KINDA. I RESPECTFULLY ANSWER MY

01:17:54.836 --> 01:17:57.205
OWN QUESTION AND THAT IS I DON'T

01:17:57.272 --> 01:17:59.841
BELIEVE THE ASSUMPTION IF IT IS

01:17:59.908 --> 01:18:01.977
AN ASSUMPTION THAT- THE

01:18:02.044 --> 01:18:03.278
COMMISSION ON CREDENTIALING IS

01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:05.881
MAKING AYE AYE I DO NOT ACCEPT

01:18:05.947 --> 01:18:09.151
THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE WHATEVER

01:18:09.217 --> 01:18:11.253
NUMBER OF SOCIAL STUDIES

01:18:11.319 --> 01:18:13.388
TEACHERS THAT WHOLE CREDENTIALS

01:18:13.455 --> 01:18:15.690
IN SOCIAL STUDIES ARE QUALIFIED

01:18:15.757 --> 01:18:17.993
TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES AND I

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:20.295
THINK AS MY COLLEAGUE HERE MR

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:22.464
SANTIAGO WHO HAD TO LEAVE

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:24.166
EARLIER SAID THE PART OF WHAT

01:18:24.232 --> 01:18:26.835
THE REASON FOR THIS HEARING. IS

01:18:26.902 --> 01:18:29.371
THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE THAT

01:18:29.438 --> 01:18:31.540
IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THE TEACHING

01:18:31.606 --> 01:18:34.743
OF ETHNIC STUDIES UNFORTUNATELY

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:37.012
BECAUSE I WAS IN THE CLASSROOM

01:18:37.079 --> 01:18:37.979
AND IN A HIGH SCHOOL FOR MANY

01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:41.483
MANY YEARS TO THE TEACHER. ALL

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.218
WHO HAVE BEEN TEACHING SOCIAL

01:18:43.285 --> 01:18:46.855
STUDIES- HISTORICALLY. ETHNIC

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:50.358
STUDIES WILL FAIL. BECAUSE THOSE

01:18:50.425 --> 01:18:52.694
TEACHERS ARE NOT QUALIFIED DO

01:18:52.761 --> 01:18:54.796
NOT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE SOME OF

01:18:54.863 --> 01:18:57.632
THEM. ACTUALLY DENY SOME OF THE

01:18:57.699 --> 01:18:59.868
THINGS THAT HAPPENED I REMEMBER

01:18:59.935 --> 01:19:01.603
TEACHING ABOUT THE NINETEEN

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:04.106
SIXTY EIGHT- WALKOUTS OF EAST LA

01:19:04.172 --> 01:19:06.174
BY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND ONE

01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:08.810
OF MY STUDENTS GOING TO HER US

01:19:08.877 --> 01:19:10.378
HISTORY. TEACHER AND HER US

01:19:10.445 --> 01:19:12.147
HISTORY TEACHER TELLING HER

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:14.549
EITHER DIDN'T HAPPEN OR WAS NOT

01:19:14.616 --> 01:19:16.952
IMPORTANT SO- I REJECT THE

01:19:17.018 --> 01:19:20.155
ASSUMPTION THAT THE WHATEVER

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:21.289
FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND TEACHERS

01:19:21.356 --> 01:19:22.724
THAT HOLD SOCIAL STUDIES

01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:25.393
CREDENTIAL THAT THEY ARE IN ANY

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:27.963
WAY- QUALIFIED TO TEACH ETHNIC

01:19:28.029 --> 01:19:30.765
STUDIES SO I BELIEVE THAT THAT

01:19:30.832 --> 01:19:33.735
THAT- AND ANOTHER QUESTION

01:19:33.802 --> 01:19:36.404
PERHAPS TO DR TORTOISE DR

01:19:36.471 --> 01:19:38.874
TORTOISE ULTIMATELY. WHO IN THE

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:40.542
STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS THE

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:44.412
RESPONSIBILITY TO SEE THAT WE

01:19:44.479 --> 01:19:45.881
HAVE QUALIFIED TEACHERS TO TEACH

01:19:45.947 --> 01:19:51.019
ETHICS. DOT PRESS. SO THE

01:19:51.086 --> 01:19:53.522
RESPONSIBILITY OF ENSURING THAT

01:19:53.588 --> 01:19:56.124
WE HAVE QUALIFIED TEACHERS-

01:19:56.191 --> 01:19:59.661
FALLS ON THE WILLIAMS ACT AND-

01:19:59.728 --> 01:20:02.497
THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:05.133
DO YOU MONITOR- WITH RESPECT TO

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.035
WILLIAMS. WITH TEACHER

01:20:07.102 --> 01:20:09.137
CREDENTIALING AS WELL AS

01:20:09.204 --> 01:20:14.176
TEXTBOOKS SUFFICIENCY. AND THEN

01:20:14.242 --> 01:20:16.511
MAYBE MY LAST QUESTION- ENGLISH

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:19.147
TEACHERS RIGHT A TEACHERS OF A

01:20:19.214 --> 01:20:24.085
LANGUAGE ARTS. ARE THEY- THAT

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:26.788
WOULD SOME OF THEM ALSO BE ABLE

01:20:26.855 --> 01:20:30.725
TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES. I DON'T

01:20:30.792 --> 01:20:32.561
KNOW WHO WANTS TO ANSWER THAT

01:20:32.627 --> 01:20:34.629
QUESTION. OKAY INTO THEM

01:20:34.696 --> 01:20:37.799
QUESTION- NO THEY WOULD NOT BE

01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:39.067
AUTHORIZED TO TEACH ETHNIC

01:20:39.134 --> 01:20:41.002
STUDIES BECAUSE- THE ENGLISH

01:20:41.069 --> 01:20:42.504
AUTHORIZATION DOES NOT HAVE THT

01:20:42.571 --> 01:20:44.105
CONTENT AREAS SUBSUMED WITHIN

01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:46.007
THAT THE BROAD STATUTORY SUBJECT

01:20:46.074 --> 01:20:49.277
OF ENGLISH. BUT IF THE DISTRICT

01:20:49.344 --> 01:20:51.613
TAUGHT A CLASS LIKE. LATINO

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.615
LITERATURE OR AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:55.483
LITERATURE IN IN THAT IN THAT

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:58.053
CASE THE TEACHER WOULD BE IS

01:20:58.119 --> 01:20:59.521
THAT CORRECT. IF A SCHOOL

01:20:59.588 --> 01:21:01.122
DELIBERATELY INCITED TO TEACH A

01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:02.857
CLASS WHICH I BELIEVE THERE ARE

01:21:02.924 --> 01:21:05.327
ALREADY IN EXISTENCE A CLASS

01:21:05.393 --> 01:21:08.230
LIKE. NATIVE AMERICAN LITERATURE

01:21:08.296 --> 01:21:09.864
OR AFRICAN AMERICAN LITERATURE

01:21:09.931 --> 01:21:12.901
ASIAN AMERICAN LITERATURE LATINO

01:21:12.968 --> 01:21:15.203
LITERATURE WOULDN'T THE TEACHER

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:18.640
WHO HOLDS AN ENGLISH. CREDENTIAL

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:21.576
THEN BE QUALIFIED TO TEACH SUCH

01:21:21.643 --> 01:21:23.778
CLASS. THE COULD BE IT DEPENDS

01:21:23.845 --> 01:21:26.615
ON HOW THAT CLASS WITH COLLUDED-

01:21:26.681 --> 01:21:28.617
FOR THE CALCUTTA STATE REPORTING

01:21:28.683 --> 01:21:30.719
REQUIREMENT AND THAT. STATE

01:21:30.785 --> 01:21:32.020
COURTS COULD THAT IT WAS

01:21:32.087 --> 01:21:34.689
ASSIGNED SO THEY COULD BE OKAY.

01:21:34.756 --> 01:21:36.625
RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

01:21:36.691 --> 01:21:43.164
WEBER

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:45.634
YOUR COMMENTS I DO NOT BELIEVE

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:47.702
THAT SOMEONE WHO WITH TO JUST

01:21:47.769 --> 01:21:49.838
HAVE THE BASIC SOCIAL SCIENCE

01:21:49.904 --> 01:21:52.674
TEACHING CREDENTIAL- WITHOUT

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:54.809
HAVING ANY FURTHER TRAINING

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:58.113
SPECIFICALLY TO ETHNIC STUDIES

01:21:58.179 --> 01:22:00.749
HAVE TO TEACH AT THE NEXT.

01:22:00.815 --> 01:22:04.219
SHOULD BE ON THE ONES TEACHING

01:22:04.286 --> 01:22:07.756
OUR KIDS ETHNIC STUDIES I AM I

01:22:07.822 --> 01:22:10.492
AM NEWER TO THE LEGISLATIVE FIVE

01:22:10.558 --> 01:22:12.360
I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT EACH

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:14.562
SCHOOL DISTRICT IT'S NOT READY

01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:16.398
TO CONNECT CRAFTED ON- ETHNIC

01:22:16.464 --> 01:22:19.401
STUDIES- CURRICULUM I THINK WE

DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION

02:00:31.357 --> 02:00:33.559
SHIFTING SHIFTING GIVEN THE

02:00:33.626 --> 02:00:36.696
SEARCH DANCES IT BUT WE HAD

02:00:36.762 --> 02:00:38.598
EXPERIENCE THE YEAR. SCHIFF GEN

02:00:38.664 --> 02:00:42.635
OF. WHAT IT IS TO BE A TEACHER

02:00:42.702 --> 02:00:45.271
AN EFFECTIVE TEACHER SO I FAVOR

02:00:45.338 --> 02:00:49.775
THAT VERY MUCH- BUT IN WHAT

02:00:49.842 --> 02:00:52.044
DIRECTION WOULD YOU RECOMMEND

02:00:52.111 --> 02:00:54.447
THE THREE OF YOU THAT THE DO THE

02:00:54.513 --> 02:00:56.983
COMMISSION UNCONSCIOUSLY MOVE.

02:00:57.049 --> 02:01:01.187
AS SPECIFICALLY THE CLASSES OF

02:01:01.253 --> 02:01:02.321
ETHNICSTUDIES AT THE HIGH

02:01:02.388 --> 02:01:07.226
SCHOOL. SHOULD BE A CREDENTIAL

02:01:07.293 --> 02:01:09.729
IN ETHNIC STUDIES SHOULD BE A

02:01:09.795 --> 02:01:12.565
CONCENTRATION IN ETHNIC STUDIES

02:01:12.632 --> 02:01:15.768
A SPECIALIZATION WITHIN WHAT

02:01:15.835 --> 02:01:18.270
DIRECTION SHOULD WE LOOK TO THE

02:01:18.337 --> 02:01:21.007
COMMISSION. IT ANGELES MOVE

02:01:21.073 --> 02:01:22.708
BECAUSE I THINK NOT TO DO

02:01:22.775 --> 02:01:25.411
ANYTHING IS TO THROW UP YOUR

02:01:25.478 --> 02:01:27.580
HANDS AND THAT'S WHAT I'M SEEING

02:01:27.647 --> 02:01:32.251
RIGHT NOW SO. IN WHAT DIRECTION

02:01:32.318 --> 02:01:33.285
SHOULD WE LOOK INTO THE

02:01:33.352 --> 02:01:34.453
COMMITTEE ON CREDENTIALING

02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:37.556
MOVING. SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE

02:01:37.623 --> 02:01:40.760
THE BEST TEACHERS. TEACHING THE

02:01:40.826 --> 02:01:42.428
SPECIFIC CLASSES AT OUR HIGH

02:01:42.495 --> 02:01:45.431
SCHOOLS THAT MEET THE GRADUATION

02:01:45.498 --> 02:01:51.003
REQUIREMENTS YOUR SUGGESTIONS.

02:01:51.070 --> 02:01:54.440
DR BY BLACK YOU MAY BE. IF I HAD

02:01:54.507 --> 02:01:57.810
TO SUGGEST I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S

02:01:57.877 --> 02:02:01.080
VERY DIFFICULT TO TEACH ETHNIC

02:02:01.147 --> 02:02:03.849
STUDIES WHAT OUT KNOWLEDGE OF

02:02:03.916 --> 02:02:05.851
ETHNIC STUDIES I WOULD SAY IT'S

02:02:05.918 --> 02:02:10.489
IMPOSSIBLE BUT AT THE STATE- I

02:02:10.556 --> 02:02:14.126
WOULD I. BE AN AGREEMENT. AT

02:02:14.193 --> 02:02:16.028
THAT THE COURSE WORK SHOULD

02:02:16.095 --> 02:02:19.498
INCLUDE IN ADDITION TO THE

02:02:19.565 --> 02:02:21.534
REQUIREMENTS FOR CREDENTIALING-

02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:26.105
BUT ALSO INCLUDE- OF COURSE AND

02:02:26.172 --> 02:02:29.075
ETHNICS. SO IN. IT WOULD BE

02:02:29.141 --> 02:02:31.911
CERTIFICATE HE WELL BUT THERE'S

02:02:31.977 --> 02:02:33.779
NO. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN

02:02:33.846 --> 02:02:38.684
THE SUBJECT MATTER. DR HIM YEAH

02:02:38.751 --> 02:02:41.454
I AGREE ALSO- THE OTHER THING I

02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:43.923
THINK WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE IS

02:02:43.989 --> 02:02:46.726
A SOMETHING WORSE TRANSACTION

02:02:46.792 --> 02:02:48.861
SOMEONE JUST CHECK A BOX THIS

02:02:48.928 --> 02:02:51.597
ISN'T EVENT. A SAYS THAT WILL

02:02:51.664 --> 02:02:53.065
BOB OVERTIME- I AGREE I THINK IT

02:02:53.132 --> 02:02:55.201
COULD BE- MAYBE AN ADDED

02:02:55.267 --> 02:02:57.770
AUTHORIZATION TO PRUDENT WELL AS

02:02:57.837 --> 02:03:00.239
YOU GO BACK IN. VOGUE AND

02:03:00.306 --> 02:03:02.475
RETRAIN ITSELF. SOME OF THE BAD

02:03:02.541 --> 02:03:04.009
THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN

02:03:04.076 --> 02:03:07.847
CONFRONTING FIVE- SO THEY CAN TO

02:03:07.913 --> 02:03:11.350
PROFESSIONAL- AS WE'RE AS WE'RE

02:03:11.417 --> 02:03:15.254
BUILDING AND- THIS NEW THIS.

02:03:15.321 --> 02:03:19.825
PLACE CB. THIS PRUDENTIAL- WITH

02:03:19.892 --> 02:03:21.060
THE BUCKET OF COURSE IS ARE

02:03:21.127 --> 02:03:22.261
COMBINATION OF PRACTICAL MAKES-

02:03:22.328 --> 02:03:23.929
YOU KNOW ACTION THAT'S HAPPENING

02:03:23.996 --> 02:03:25.765
IN THE COMMUNITY I MEAN THIS IS

02:03:25.831 --> 02:03:27.233
REALLY WHERE I THINK YOU KNOW

02:03:27.299 --> 02:03:28.868
POLICY AND ACTIVISM REALLY COMES

02:03:28.934 --> 02:03:31.303
TOGETHER SO THERE'S SOME

02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:33.939
CREATIVE THINGS WE COULD DO WITH

02:03:34.006 --> 02:03:35.941
THE PEDAGOGY AND TRY. ON THIS

02:03:36.008 --> 02:03:37.009

YOU KNOW ALSO THE RESOURCES TO

02:03:42.448 --> 02:03:44.183

THEY DON'T FEEL SOME OF THE-

02:03:46.085 --> 02:03:47.553
PRESSURE I KNOW WE YOU KNOW THE

02:03:47.620 --> 02:03:51.023

02:04:08.941 --> 02:04:12.311
OUR PROGRAM OR NOT WORKING FOR I

02:04:12.378 --> 02:04:15.381

HAVE TO ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:17.603
TEACHERS ARE HUMAN TOO I THINK

02:06:17.670 --> 02:06:19.838
THE BEST WAY TO TEACH IT IS TO

02:06:19.905 --> 02:06:21.607

I THINK TEACHERS UNDERSTAND THAT

02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:16.195

02:07:16.261 --> 02:07:18.864

DIAZ. AND AS A CHICANO CHICANA

02:24:34.298 --> 02:24:37.869

02:24:37.935 --> 02:24:40.872
AT ALL ABOUT MY HISTORY- WHERE I

02:24:40.938 --> 02:24:45.209
CAME FROM OR OR HOW I WAS

02:24:45.276 --> 02:24:48.413
GROUNDED IN THE COPY. OF AND THE

02:24:48.479 --> 02:24:49.347

CHICANO CHICANA STUDIES CLASS

02:24:50.782 --> 02:24:52.784
WITH DR I HAD A SOCIETY THAT

02:24:52.850 --> 02:24:56.954
THAT- IT WAS AN OPENING OF

02:24:57.021 --> 02:24:59.123
REVELATION- ALMOST A

02:24:59.190 --> 02:25:02.326
METAMORPHOSIS OF HOW I SAW

02:25:02.393 --> 02:25:03.728
MYSELF HOW I VIEW MYSELF AND IT

02:25:03.795 --> 02:25:08.533
WAS. WHICH GOT ME. I MAY THE

02:25:08.599 --> 02:25:10.234
VERY INTENSE TO SEE TO BE A

02:25:10.301 --> 02:25:12.637
TEACHER IN ORDER TO REALLY OFFER

02:25:12.703 --> 02:25:15.406
AN ALTERNATIVE TO WHAT I HAD

02:25:15.473 --> 02:25:18.609
RECEIVED IN EDUCATION SO I FRAME

02:25:18.676 --> 02:25:21.179
MY TALK TODAY A LITTLE BIT- IN

02:25:21.245 --> 02:25:23.047
THAT CONTEXT ALSO IN THE CONTEXT

02:25:23.114 --> 02:25:25.516
OF WHAT I'M ON GROUND WHAT THE

02:25:25.583 --> 02:25:28.019
TEACHERS THAT- AND PROSPECTIVE

02:25:28.086 --> 02:25:30.655
TEACHERS THAT I'M WORKING WITH.

02:25:30.721 --> 02:25:33.491
SO IN THAT SEVERAL MANY OF US

02:25:33.558 --> 02:25:35.259
HAVE WITNESSED AN ORGANIZED THE

02:25:35.326 --> 02:25:37.695
RIGHTEOUS SURGE IN HOLDING

02:25:37.762 --> 02:25:39.163
DISTRICTS ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR

02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:41.232
STUDENTS AND IMPLEMENTING ETHNIC

02:25:41.299 --> 02:25:43.334
STUDIES AS A HIGH SCHOOL

02:25:43.401 --> 02:25:44.802
REQUIREMENTS. AT THE STATE LEVEL

02:25:44.869 --> 02:25:46.637
THOSE SAME TO HAVE MANIFESTED

02:25:46.704 --> 02:25:49.574
WITH AB ONE OH ONE. AND NOW

02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:50.775
LEGISLATION EXISTS THAT

02:25:50.842 --> 02:25:51.776
SOLIDIFIES THE RITICAL

02:25:51.843 --> 02:25:53.411
IMPORTANCE OF ALL STUDENTS

02:25:53.478 --> 02:25:55.480
TAKING ETHNIC STUDIES HOWEVER A

02:25:55.546 --> 02:25:57.882
MAJOR QUESTION STILL EXISTS

02:25:57.949 --> 02:25:59.484
WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING

02:25:59.550 --> 02:26:01.419
TO ANSWER IT SHOULD BE ALL

02:26:01.486 --> 02:26:05.089
AFTERNOON. COOL TEACH AT THIRTY

02:26:05.156 --> 02:26:06.057
. WHO WILL PREPARE PRE AND

02:26:06.124 --> 02:26:07.558
INSERVICE TEACHERS TO TEACH

02:26:07.625 --> 02:26:10.695
EXPERTISE AND HOW WILL THEY BE

02:26:10.761 --> 02:26:12.530
PREPARED. AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT

02:26:12.597 --> 02:26:14.098
CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF

02:26:14.165 --> 02:26:15.833
ETHNIC STUDIES PROGRAMS ARE THE

02:26:15.900 --> 02:26:18.202
TEACHERS TO THIS POINT CHRISTINE

02:26:18.269 --> 02:26:20.905
LEADER STATES AND I QUOTE I

02:26:20.972 --> 02:26:22.373
THINK THESE TEACHERS MUST BE

02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:24.242
ABLE TO RELATE WELL WITH THEIR

02:26:24.308 --> 02:26:25.409
STUDENTS. BUT EVEN IF IN FACT

02:26:25.476 --> 02:26:27.345
MAKE ABILITY. WHAT'S NEXT THAT

02:26:27.411 --> 02:26:31.349
IS CONTENT AND PERSPECTIVE WELL

02:26:31.415 --> 02:26:32.583
- BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT ALWAYS

02:26:32.650 --> 02:26:33.918
HAPPENS. SOMETIMES THEY ARE

02:26:33.985 --> 02:26:35.219
MEMBERS OF THE SAME ETHNIC

02:26:35.286 --> 02:26:37.088
BACKGROUND OF MOST OF THEIR

02:26:37.155 --> 02:26:39.690
STUDENTS CURRENTLY IN MOST

02:26:39.757 --> 02:26:42.326
PLACES THE OPPOSITE OCCURS. ONE

02:26:42.393 --> 02:26:44.262
NEED ONLY HAVE AS YOU'VE ALREADY

02:26:44.328 --> 02:26:46.197
HEARD. A SOCIAL SCIENCE

02:26:46.264 --> 02:26:48.199
CREDENTIAL TO BE ABLE TO TEACH

02:26:48.266 --> 02:26:50.001
ETHNIC STUDIES IN ORDER TO SEAL

02:26:50.067 --> 02:26:51.435
THE SAME RESULT REPORTED IN

02:26:51.502 --> 02:26:53.771
THEATERS RESEARCH NOTED ABOVE

02:26:53.838 --> 02:26:56.440
FUTURE I THINK THE TEACHERS NEED

02:26:56.507 --> 02:26:58.342
CRITICAL COULD TEACHING

02:26:58.409 --> 02:27:00.144
CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS THAT IS

02:27:00.211 --> 02:27:02.580
WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH

02:27:02.647 --> 02:27:04.715
STRONG UNDERGRADUATE ETHNIC

02:27:13.658 --> 02:27:15.560
DEVELOP CERTIFICATES ALSO IN

02:27:15.626 --> 02:27:17.929
COLLABORATION. THIS SHOULD NOT

02:27:17.995 --> 02:27:19.864
BE AN EITHER OR BECAUSE OF THE

02:27:19.931 --> 02:27:21.365
IMPORTANCE FOR THESE TWO

02:27:21.432 --> 02:27:24.468
ENTITIES TO WORK TOGETHER BASED

02:27:24.535 --> 02:27:26.437
ON THE EXPERTISE OF CONTENT. TO

02:27:26.504 --> 02:27:29.440
GO G. AND METHODOLOGY. AS JUST

02:27:29.507 --> 02:27:31.609
EARLIER INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT

02:27:31.676 --> 02:27:33.578
WAITING RIGHT WE ARE MOVING

02:27:33.644 --> 02:27:35.112
FORWARD AND YOU'LL ALSO HEAR

02:27:35.179 --> 02:27:37.181
FROM MY COLLEAGUE DR THAT IS

02:27:37.248 --> 02:27:39.250
SOMEONE DANIEL. THE COMMISSION

02:27:39.317 --> 02:27:42.787
CANNOT EITHER. AND I SAY THIS

02:27:42.853 --> 02:27:44.488
WITH THE EXAMPLE THAT I'M ABOUT

02:27:44.555 --> 02:27:45.923
TO SHARE RIGHT NOW IN THE

02:27:45.990 --> 02:27:47.592
POSITION THAT I CURRENTLY HOLD

02:27:47.658 --> 02:27:49.894
NOT ONLY IS THE PROFESSOR BUT

02:27:49.961 --> 02:27:51.429
ALSO AS SERVING AS A LIAISON

02:27:51.495 --> 02:27:54.498
BETWEEN ETHNIC STUDIES AND ARE

02:27:54.565 --> 02:27:56.267
STILL SUBJECT CREDENTIAL AS AN

02:27:56.334 --> 02:27:59.670
ADVISER. I TO REALLY COME TO IN

02:27:59.737 --> 02:28:01.539
A PROFOUND WAY. AS I SHARE THAN

02:28:01.606 --> 02:28:02.940
CURRENT ADVISING ETHNIC STUDENTS

02:28:03.007 --> 02:28:04.809
AT SACRAMENTO STATE THAT WANT TO

02:28:04.875 --> 02:28:06.844
BE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS AND

02:28:06.911 --> 02:28:09.947
TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES AND I JUST

02:28:10.014 --> 02:28:11.048
WANT TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE

02:28:11.115 --> 02:28:14.652
THAT ETHNIC STUDIES IS. THE PLAN

02:28:14.719 --> 02:28:15.953
IN AND OF ITSELF. AND THERE ARE

02:28:16.020 --> 02:28:18.322
DEFINITELY POINTS WE HAVE TO

02:28:18.389 --> 02:28:21.259
CONSIDER AND CONTINUE TO ONE

02:28:21.325 --> 02:28:24.595
PACK. BECAUSE THERE IS NO ETHNIC

02:28:24.662 --> 02:28:26.497
STUDIES CREDENTIAL WHICH IS WHAT

02:28:26.564 --> 02:28:28.199
I WOULD HIGHLY ENCOURAGE IN

02:28:28.266 --> 02:28:30.268
ADDITION TO OTHER ALTERNATIVES

02:28:30.334 --> 02:28:32.169
ARE UNDERGRADUATE ETHNIC STUDIES

02:28:32.236 --> 02:28:34.171
MAJORS CURRENTLY THAT HAVE NOT

02:28:34.238 --> 02:28:37.074
YET ENTERED PREVENTION PROGRAM

02:28:37.141 --> 02:28:39.010
THE PRE SERVICE TEACHER BUT WILL

02:28:39.076 --> 02:28:42.346
TO BE TEACHER. FROM MY- HI WILL

02:28:42.413 --> 02:28:44.448
THE WORK. AS ALREADY MENTIONED

02:28:44.515 --> 02:28:45.916
THAT CURRENTLY TEACH OR WANT TO

02:28:45.983 --> 02:28:47.752
TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES MUST HAVE A

02:28:47.818 --> 02:28:49.320
SOCIAL SCIENCE CREDENTIAL BUT

02:28:49.387 --> 02:28:50.921
THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY

02:28:50.988 --> 02:28:53.391
HAVE ANY BACKGROUND IN THE

02:28:53.457 --> 02:28:55.726
DISCIPLINE. SB STUDIES MAJORS

02:28:55.793 --> 02:28:57.895
UNDERGRADUATES FOR THE MOST PART

02:28:57.962 --> 02:28:59.497
WHY COULDN'T FIND IT WITH THE

02:28:59.563 --> 02:29:01.032
FACT THAT THEIR MAJOR EVEN

02:29:01.098 --> 02:29:02.600
THOUGH IT IS I THINK STUDIES

02:29:02.667 --> 02:29:04.468
WILL STILL NOW ALLOW THEM WILL

02:29:04.535 --> 02:29:07.838
NOT ALLOW THEM TO TEACH. ETHNIC

02:29:07.905 --> 02:29:10.241

02:29:10.308 --> 02:29:11.942
ULTIMATELY FORCES THEM TO REDUCE

02:29:12.009 --> 02:29:14.078
THEIR CONTENT AREA TO ANOTHER

02:29:14.145 --> 02:29:18.015
AND OTHER AND LET ME EXPLAIN

02:29:18.082 --> 02:29:19.216

HAVE TO DECIDE. MY MANAGEMENT-

02:29:22.219 --> 02:29:24.522
BUT THEN ENSURE THAT THEY ARE

02:29:24.588 --> 02:29:27.024
TAKING ALL THE COURSES NECESSARY

02:29:27.091 --> 02:29:29.493
OUTSIDE OF THEIR FIELD IN THIS

02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:31.495
CONTEXT SOCIAL SCIENCE TO MEET

02:29:31.562 --> 02:29:32.963
SUBJECT MATTER COMPETENCY IN

02:29:33.030 --> 02:29:35.800
SOCIAL SCIENCE WE ARE CURRENTLY

02:29:35.866 --> 02:29:37.134
WORKING WITH ETHNIC STUDIES

02:29:37.201 --> 02:29:38.903
FACULTY QUITE CLOSELY TO

02:29:38.969 --> 02:29:40.404
DETERMINE WHICH ARE THOSE

02:29:40.471 --> 02:29:42.139
APPROPRIATE COURSES VIA THE

02:29:42.206 --> 02:29:43.974
PROPAGATION OF MEANS OF ETHNIC

02:29:44.041 --> 02:29:47.778
STUDIES WE SAID SHE- ARE. VIA

02:29:47.845 --> 02:29:49.146
THE SEAT AND THE MADE IT MAY

02:29:49.213 --> 02:29:51.182
SUCH AS ENGLISH MATH TO NAME A

02:29:51.248 --> 02:29:53.050
FEW CAN DEMONSTRATE SUBJECT

02:29:53.117 --> 02:29:54.852
MATTER COMPENSATE JUST BE OTHER

02:29:54.919 --> 02:29:59.990
MAJOR BUT THIRTY. NOT THIS IS

02:30:00.057 --> 02:30:02.226
THE CASE FOR ETHNIC STUDIES AS

02:30:02.293 --> 02:30:04.562
OF NOW IT HAS TO BE COMPLETED

02:30:04.628 --> 02:30:06.630
THROUGH SOCIAL SCIENCE WHICH CAN

02:30:06.697 --> 02:30:08.265
ADD TIME TO GRADUATION

02:30:08.332 --> 02:30:10.835
ESPECIALLY IF NOT ADVISED EARLY

02:30:10.901 --> 02:30:13.571
ENOUGH WHICH IS WHERE MY ROLE

02:30:13.637 --> 02:30:14.972
COMES IN RIGHT NOW I'M NOT

02:30:15.039 --> 02:30:16.574
TRYING TO GET THEM. EVEN BEFORE

02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:18.843
THEY TRANSFER SACRAMENTO STATE

02:30:18.909 --> 02:30:21.712
OR WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY FIRST

02:30:21.779 --> 02:30:22.546
YEAR STUDENTS IN WHICH ETHNIC

02:30:22.613 --> 02:30:24.582
STUDIES MAJORS WOULD THEN IF NOT

02:30:24.648 --> 02:30:26.817
ADVISED EARLY ENOUGH WOULD HAVE

02:30:26.884 --> 02:30:28.519
TO TAKE THE C. SETS. WHICH IS

02:30:28.586 --> 02:30:29.987
SUBJECT MATTER DEMONSTRATE

02:30:30.054 --> 02:30:32.022
SUBJECT MATTER WHICH CAN BE

02:30:32.089 --> 02:30:34.658
COSTLY. AS WELL OF NO RELEVANCE

02:30:34.725 --> 02:30:38.028
TO THEIR DISCIPLINE AS ETHNIC

02:30:38.095 --> 02:30:39.563
STUDIES MAJORS. SO IF THEY

02:30:39.630 --> 02:30:42.466
DETERMINE THAT IT WANTS A MAJOR

02:30:42.533 --> 02:30:44.101
ANYTHING MAJOR REALIZES THAT

02:30:44.168 --> 02:30:47.138

ADDITION THAT THEY STILL HAVE-

02:47:16.459 --> 02:47:19.295
THE IMPACT THAT THAT HAD ON US

02:47:19.362 --> 02:47:22.098

CLASS WENT ON TO BE TEACHERS

02:48:05.575 --> 02:48:07.944
LIKE MYSELF. ATTORNEYS LIKE

02:48:08.011 --> 02:48:10.346

02:48:41.845 --> 02:48:43.546
BECAUSE CATION CAN BE

02:48:43.613 --> 02:48:48.852

A HUNDRED THIRTY STUDENTS PER

02:51:02.552 --> 02:51:04.120
COHORT. PER YEAR OVER THE LAST

02:51:04.187 --> 02:51:06.556
THREE YEARS. AND WHAT WERE SEEN

SINCE WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THE

02:51:08.491 --> 02:51:09.592
ETHNIC STUDIES PATHWAY AN

02:51:09.659 --> 02:51:13.129
EMPHASIS- ALMOST 20% OF THOSE

02:51:13.196 --> 02:51:14.797
STUDENTS HAVE SOME KIND OF

02:51:14.864 --> 02:51:16.966

OBSERVING IT. THIS IS COMING

02:51:24.173 --> 02:51:25.808
THEY'RE COMING TO US WITH

02:51:25.875 --> 02:51:29.012
INTENTIONALITY WITH INTEREST

02:51:29.078 --> 02:51:31.414
WITH A PASSION TO SERVE THEIR

02:51:31.481 --> 02:51:34.417
COMMUNITIES. AND I THINK THIS IS

02:51:34.484 --> 02:51:38.488

02:51:38.554 --> 02:51:40.356
WHAT WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE IN

02:51:40.423 --> 02:51:43.059
INTEREST AND- I THINK THIS IS

02:51:43.126 --> 02:51:45.695
NOT THE PERFECT TIME TO REALLY-

02:51:45.762 --> 02:51:46.829
WRAP UP THESE EFFORTS TO

02:51:46.896 --> 02:51:48.097

ARE. I THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH

02:52:06.049 --> 02:52:07.383
FACULTY TO ACTUALLY MEET THE

02:52:07.450 --> 02:52:09.018

02:52:11.187 --> 02:52:13.022
AND SINCE WE'VE MADE BEGAN TO

02:52:13.089 --> 02:52:14.757
THE INTENTIONAL EFFORTS OF

HAVING THAT LAYS ON BRIDGE

02:52:16.893 --> 02:52:19.162
BETWEEN ETHNIC STUDIES AND

02:52:19.228 --> 02:52:21.264

THAT'S POOL THERE. BECAUSE THAT

02:52:35.044 --> 02:52:38.781

02:55:47.470 --> 02:55:49.538
PEOPLE- BUT I DON'T THINK THAT

02:55:49.605 --> 02:55:51.574
WE GOT TO HAVE A BROAD DIVERSE

02:55:51.641 --> 02:55:54.343
ARRAY OF FOLKS AND WHEN WE HAVE

02:55:54.410 --> 02:55:55.344
GOTTEN GOOD CURRICULUM. THE

02:55:55.411 --> 02:55:57.847

WE WANT A LOT OF WAYS WE'VE GOT

02:56:04.854 --> 02:56:07.556
A LOT PLACES IN DON'T. FROM

02:56:07.623 --> 02:56:11.994
DIFFERENT. WHAT THE TO STAR HOW

02:56:12.061 --> 02:56:14.130
WE CONSTRUCT A ON THAT WERE FOR

02:56:14.196 --> 02:56:15.765
THIS EXCEPT A DIVERSE STATE THAT

02:56:15.831 --> 02:56:17.366

GREAT ACADEMIC I'M ALSO FROM THE

02:56:26.275 --> 02:56:27.310
FACT THAT THERE ARE. ARGUMENTS

02:56:27.376 --> 02:56:28.978
WITH THE POINTS I THINK ABOUT

THE- X. OF MY- OWN WHO'S ABOUT

02:56:32.615 --> 02:56:33.482
PROFESSOR USE JUST. WHO FOR. A

02:56:33.549 --> 02:56:35.418
LOT ON HOW DO WE TEACH MATH AND

02:56:35.484 --> 02:56:37.320
R. K. TWELVE. RATE ARGUMENT IN

02:56:37.386 --> 02:56:39.488
THE CASE. BETWEEN TENSIONERS

02:56:39.555 --> 02:56:40.456
BETWEEN I COULD ABOUT THE MOST

02:56:40.523 --> 02:56:43.326
UP WAY HOW SHOULD WE TEACH MATH

02:56:43.392 --> 02:56:43.926
AND YOU KNOW CERTAIN THINGS

02:56:43.993 --> 02:56:46.228
ABOUT MATH OR ARE INDISPUTABLE

02:56:46.295 --> 02:56:47.997
BUT THE- HOW DO YOU TEACH THE

02:56:48.064 --> 02:56:50.800
DIVERSE STATE. HARSTAD IN THEIR

02:56:50.866 --> 02:56:52.168
NUMBERS IN OUR PEOPLE COMING TO

02:56:52.234 --> 02:56:53.602
THE TABLE SO I THINK IT'S

02:56:53.669 --> 02:56:55.071
IMPORTANT WE'RE INCLUDING OUR

02:56:55.137 --> 02:56:58.074
FACULTY I THINK WE- THE BROADEST

02:56:58.140 --> 02:56:59.241
GROUP PROPERTY POSSIBLE BUT I

02:56:59.308 --> 02:57:01.644
ALSO INCLUDE A LOT STAKEHOLDERS

02:57:01.711 --> 02:57:05.448
AND WE- BOTH OF IT. WE HAVE. IN

02:57:05.514 --> 02:57:07.316
TWO THE DIVERSITY OUR STATE

02:57:07.383 --> 02:57:08.484
THAT'S HOW I GET THE STRAW

02:57:08.551 --> 02:57:09.518
PROPONENTS WOULD JUST OFFER THAT

02:57:09.585 --> 02:57:12.621
AS MY PERSPECTIVE AND I WANT TO

02:57:12.688 --> 02:57:13.889
THANK YOU SHARE FOR THE CURRENT

IT IT IT JUST ON THE- LITTLE BIT

02:57:20.162 --> 02:57:22.064
FEARS DAY GABRIEL AND THINK ONE

02:57:22.131 --> 02:57:24.600
OF. THE STRENGTHS OF ETHNIC

02:57:24.667 --> 02:57:27.937
STUDIES. IS THAT. AS A

02:57:28.004 --> 02:57:31.340
DISCIPLINE BECAUSE WHERE IT CAME

02:57:31.407 --> 02:57:35.011
. THAT FROM THE BOTTOM UP YOU

02:57:35.077 --> 02:57:38.047
KNOW ETHNIC STUDIES WAS A- A

02:57:38.114 --> 02:57:40.349
CRITIQUE ON OUR EDUCATIONAL

02:57:40.416 --> 02:57:44.086
SYSTEM A CRITIQUE OF THE

02:57:44.153 --> 02:57:45.454
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THAT WAS IN

02:57:45.521 --> 02:57:49.225
PLACE AND IT IS. PUBLIC

02:57:49.291 --> 02:57:51.894
EDUCATION BEGAN AND IT WAS A

02:57:51.961 --> 02:57:53.796
CRITIQUE SAYING THAT CERTAIN

02:57:53.863 --> 02:57:56.032
GROUPS HAD BEEN OMITTED. AND

02:57:56.098 --> 02:57:58.334
CERTAIN FOLKS HISTORIES AND

02:57:58.401 --> 02:58:00.336
VALUES HAD BEEN A MINUTE SO

02:58:00.403 --> 02:58:01.771
BECAUSE IT COMES FROM THE BOTTOM

02:58:01.837 --> 02:58:04.940
UP INHERENTLY AN ETHNIC STUDIES

02:58:05.007 --> 02:58:09.645
THEREIS THAT OF INCLUDING THE

02:58:09.712 --> 02:58:13.783
CAN. AS WE- WE'RE AT ALL LEVELS

02:58:13.849 --> 02:58:16.485
OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES AND THEN

02:58:16.552 --> 02:58:19.021
AS WE GO TO IMPLEMENT- ETHNIC

02:58:19.088 --> 02:58:20.856
STUDIES I THINK WE WOULD WOULD

02:58:20.923 --> 02:58:23.125
HEAR FROM ALL OUR OTHER

02:58:23.192 --> 02:58:26.429
EDUCATIONAL FOLKS THAT THE

02:58:26.495 --> 02:58:28.364
COMMUNITIES ARE ALSO BEING

02:58:28.431 --> 02:58:31.967
INCLUDED AND SO WHEN I TURN YOUR

02:58:32.034 --> 02:58:35.638
CHOI I SAID THE- I. CAUGHT ON

02:58:35.704 --> 02:58:38.607
DOCTOR CHECK- TO COME AND SPEAK

02:58:38.674 --> 02:58:40.810
TO OUR USD IT WASN'T SO MUCH

02:58:40.876 --> 02:58:43.312
BECAUSE OF HIS ACADEMIC AND HE

02:58:43.379 --> 02:58:46.282
DIDN'T EVEN COME FROM IT- AT

02:58:46.348 --> 02:58:47.750
FROM THAT DIRECTION IT WAS

02:58:47.817 --> 02:58:50.519
BECAUSE HE WAS ALSO FOR THE

02:58:50.586 --> 02:58:51.987
COMMUNITY. AND YOU KNOW I WENT

02:58:52.054 --> 02:58:54.857
TO A CONGRESSMAN TO CONDOS

02:58:54.924 --> 02:58:57.393
MOTHER NANCY TO KHAN WHO PASSED

02:58:57.460 --> 02:58:59.762
AWAY SOON AFTER THE MEETING AND

02:58:59.829 --> 02:59:04.300
NANCY TOCADO CON THE CONDOS- MOM

02:59:04.366 --> 02:59:06.001
HAD BEEN IN THE INTERMENT YOU

02:59:06.068 --> 02:59:07.937
KNOW HAD BEEN ENTERED DURING THE

02:59:08.003 --> 02:59:10.106
WORLD WAR TWO SHE HAD THE

02:59:10.172 --> 02:59:12.842
HISTORY OF HAVING LIVED IN THE

02:59:12.908 --> 02:59:16.579
CAPS SO THE ONE OF THE STRENGTH

02:59:16.645 --> 02:59:19.849
THAT IS TO GROUP. THAT THAT IS

02:59:19.915 --> 02:59:21.750
DRAWS UPON THE COMMUNITY AND THE

02:59:21.817 --> 02:59:23.886
COMMUNITY'S HISTORY. IN WHAT IS

02:59:23.953 --> 02:59:27.389
TAUGHT- SO THAT'S KIND OF IN HER

02:59:27.456 --> 02:59:30.326
INHERENT IN ETHNIC STUDIES AND

02:59:30.392 --> 02:59:33.596
JUST JUST TO SHARE THE- ANY

02:59:33.662 --> 02:59:37.133
OTHER QUESTIONS MR BLOW. NOW I

02:59:37.199 --> 02:59:41.337
WOULD ASK THE QUESTION- THAT YOU

02:59:41.403 --> 02:59:43.906
GET YOU BROUGHT OUT I THINK- DR

02:59:43.973 --> 02:59:44.573
I WILL LET YOU BROUGHT OUT. THE

02:59:44.640 --> 02:59:46.742
T. DEGREE T. AN ETHNIC STUDIES

02:59:46.809 --> 02:59:51.480
MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT. TO

02:59:51.547 --> 02:59:53.649
BECOME A TEACHER. BUT SOMETIMES

02:59:53.716 --> 02:59:56.952
DEPENDING IF YOU DON'T HAVE. OF

02:59:57.019 --> 02:59:58.487
FOR EXAMPLE AT NORTHRIDGE THEY

02:59:58.554 --> 02:59:59.555
HAVE THE SUBJECT MATTER

02:59:59.622 --> 03:00:01.090
AUTHORIZATION THROUGH ETHNIC

03:00:01.157 --> 03:00:04.326
STUDIES RIGHT. AT SACRAMENTO

03:00:04.393 --> 03:00:06.929
THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND SO IF A

03:00:06.996 --> 03:00:09.098
STUDENT IS AN ETHNIC STUDIES

03:00:09.165 --> 03:00:11.767
MAJOR AND WANTS TO ENSURE THE

03:00:11.834 --> 03:00:14.003
TEACHING CREDENTIAL PROGRAM THEY

03:00:14.069 --> 03:00:15.638
HAVE TO SHOW SOME MATTER

03:00:15.704 --> 03:00:18.774
COMPETENCY BUT THAT'S NOT I

03:00:18.841 --> 03:00:20.176
DIDN'T SEE. NOW IS SOCIAL

03:00:20.242 --> 03:00:23.412
SCIENCE. IT SO THEN NOT ONLY

03:00:23.479 --> 03:00:25.347
WITH THEY HAVE TO. TAKE THE

03:00:25.414 --> 03:00:27.316
REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR OWN MAJOR

03:00:27.383 --> 03:00:29.785
RIGHT BUT THEN THEY WOULD HAVE

03:00:29.852 --> 03:00:32.321
TO ALSO TAKE ALL THE COURSES.

03:00:32.388 --> 03:00:36.292
THAT THIS DANCE DISCIPLINE SAYS

03:00:36.358 --> 03:00:38.294
IS NECESSARY TO SHOW SOCIAL

03:00:38.360 --> 03:00:40.362
SCIENCE COMPETENCY. AND SO

03:00:40.429 --> 03:00:42.598
THAT'S WHERE I THINK YOU SEE THE

03:00:42.665 --> 03:00:45.067
EQUITY RESPECT TO THE LEVEL OF

03:00:45.134 --> 03:00:47.937
WORK THAT AN ETHNIC STUDIES

03:00:48.003 --> 03:00:50.673
MAJOR. PASSED YOU THINK THAT

03:00:50.739 --> 03:00:52.641
SOMEONE WILL SET A PERFECT WAS A

03:00:52.708 --> 03:00:54.610
JUST A POWERFUL THING SHE SAYS

03:00:54.677 --> 03:00:57.613
YOU KNOW I THINK THIS. COULD NOT

03:00:57.680 --> 03:00:59.315
LOOK THAT AS OR DO IN THE SAME

03:00:59.381 --> 03:01:03.519
WAY AS- ENGLISH AS DID THE OTHER

03:01:03.586 --> 03:01:04.320
DIFFERENT SUBJECT MATTERS AND

03:01:04.386 --> 03:01:09.692
THAT IS WHAT HAS. MY WHAT I'VE

03:01:09.758 --> 03:01:11.327
BEEN FIGHTING FOR RIGHT NOW YOU

03:01:11.393 --> 03:01:13.362
KNOW OUR CAMPUS AND ACROSS THE

03:01:13.429 --> 03:01:15.631
STATE AS WE CONTINUE TO ORGANIZE

03:01:15.698 --> 03:01:16.599
COLLECTIVELY AND HOPEFULLY

03:01:16.665 --> 03:01:18.968
FORMING- WHICH IS THAT IF

03:01:19.034 --> 03:01:21.737
SOMEONE VALUES IDEA OF A

03:01:21.804 --> 03:01:22.738
CONSORTIUM BETWEEN. COLLEGES

03:01:22.805 --> 03:01:23.772
PROFESSORS IN TEACHER

03:01:23.839 --> 03:01:25.541
CREDENTIALING AND PROFESSORS

03:01:25.608 --> 03:01:28.110
THAT MAKE STUDIES TO RUDY- MAKE

03:01:28.177 --> 03:01:29.378
SURE THAT THERE'S THAT

03:01:29.445 --> 03:01:32.481
INTERSECTION ALITY THAT EXISTS.

03:01:32.548 --> 03:01:35.017
IT STUDENT SITE IT'S TOO MUCH

03:01:35.084 --> 03:01:37.052
COURSE WORK IT'S GOING TO EXTEND

03:01:37.119 --> 03:01:39.421
MY STATE IT'S GOING TO I'M GONNA

03:01:39.488 --> 03:01:41.724
BE HERE FIVE SIX YEARS IF I HAVE

03:01:41.790 --> 03:01:43.259
TO DO ALL THIS ISSUE DON'T CATCH

03:01:43.325 --> 03:01:45.961
THEM EARLY ENOUGH- TO BE ABLE

03:01:46.028 --> 03:01:49.465
TO. TO HAVE THOSE COURSES THEN-

03:01:49.531 --> 03:01:51.367
THEY HAVE TO TAKE THE C. SET.

03:01:51.433 --> 03:01:54.970
AND THE C. SAID BUT- FOR MANY-

03:01:55.037 --> 03:01:58.107
BY PARKS WOULDN'T. HAS BEEN VERY

03:01:58.173 --> 03:02:00.509
BIAS WITH RESPECT TO THAT- AND

03:02:00.576 --> 03:02:02.211
THE CONTENT AS I SHARED IN MY

03:02:02.278 --> 03:02:04.179
STATEMENT DOES NOT NECESSARILY

03:02:04.246 --> 03:02:05.581
REFLECT THE DISCIPLINE WHICH

03:02:05.648 --> 03:02:07.349
THEY WERE. THAT THEY STUDIED IN

03:02:07.416 --> 03:02:09.051
WHICH WAS ETHNIC STUDIES AND

03:02:09.118 --> 03:02:11.487
IT'S COSTLY AND SO THERE'S ALL

03:02:11.553 --> 03:02:14.356
THESE DIFFERENT- IS THAT COME

03:02:14.423 --> 03:02:17.559
INTO PLAY THAT I THINK THAT Y. I

03:02:17.626 --> 03:02:19.762
STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT MY OPINION

03:02:19.828 --> 03:02:29.471
THAT UP AND- I. MY CALL CRISIS.

03:02:29.538 --> 03:02:30.239
COMPACT ARE SHARING THE POWERFUL

03:02:30.306 --> 03:02:31.240
WHAT THE HAPPENING EVEN ON ALL

03:02:31.307 --> 03:02:33.208
CAMPUS THE POWERFUL WORK THAT'S

03:02:33.275 --> 03:02:34.710
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT WE FOR THE- AT

03:02:34.777 --> 03:02:38.347
THE SAME. WE HAVE TO PUSH- SEE.

03:02:38.414 --> 03:02:40.582
THAT COULD BE THE BY ALL OF YOU

03:02:40.649 --> 03:02:41.317
. AND IT WOULD HIGHLY. THAT I

03:02:41.383 --> 03:02:43.185
THINK IT INTEREST. THAT THE

03:02:43.252 --> 03:02:44.186
RIVERS THAT DOCTOR AVILA IS NOT

03:02:44.253 --> 03:02:48.590
TRUE THAT I HEARD FROM FROM THE

03:02:48.657 --> 03:02:49.358
COMMISSION ON CREDENTIALING THAT

03:02:49.425 --> 03:02:51.393
. THAT THEY WOULD ASSUME THAT IF

03:02:51.460 --> 03:02:52.661
YOU HAVE THE SOCIAL STUDIES

03:02:52.728 --> 03:02:53.896

ON THAT OR NOT WELL THAT SHOWS

03:03:08.711 --> 03:03:10.379
THAT SHOWS THERE'S A- REAL.

03:03:10.446 --> 03:03:12.715

FROM A PUBLIC. EDUCATION

03:13:53.888 --> 03:13:57.959
PERSPECTIVE FIRST K. ONE UNLIKE

03:13:58.026 --> 03:13:59.961
COMMERCIAL VENDORS OF SAY ICE

03:14:00.028 --> 03:14:02.497
CREAM OR CHEESE WHEN WE WERE

03:14:02.564 --> 03:14:04.099
COMMISSIONED TO DELIVER ETHNIC

03:14:04.165 --> 03:14:08.570
STUDIES OUR PRODUCT MUST BE WHAT

03:14:08.636 --> 03:14:10.105
THE NAME SAYS OKAY IF YOU DID

03:14:10.171 --> 03:14:11.806
YOUR STORE YOU KNOW SOMETIMES IT

03:14:11.873 --> 03:14:13.842
IS SO THEREFORE ETHNIC STUDIES

03:14:13.908 --> 03:14:16.544
MUST EXPERTS MUST VERIFY THAT

03:14:16.611 --> 03:14:18.747
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S NO

03:14:18.813 --> 03:14:20.215
OTHER CONSULTATION WILL DO IT

03:14:20.281 --> 03:14:22.450
EVERY DAY EVEN IF. THERE'S NOT A

03:14:22.517 --> 03:14:29.858
GETS YEAH. NOT CAN. FOR YEARS-

03:14:29.924 --> 03:14:31.359
SO THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE IT'S

03:14:31.426 --> 03:14:34.062
GOING TO BE CONSULTED BUT YOU

03:14:34.129 --> 03:14:36.398
BEST GREAT QUESTIONS THAT I

03:14:36.464 --> 03:14:40.735
THINK SHOWED. A BIT OF- LACK OF

03:14:40.802 --> 03:14:42.871
DEPTH AND CLARITY IN SOME

03:14:42.937 --> 03:14:45.407
QUARTERS ON WHAT ETHNIC STUDIES

03:14:45.473 --> 03:14:47.876
WAS IN A LACK OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

03:14:47.942 --> 03:14:49.811
THAT THEY HAD TALKED TO ETHNIC

03:14:49.878 --> 03:14:51.946
STUDIES. IT'S EVEN JUST OPENED

03:14:52.013 --> 03:14:53.948
OUR CATALOGS AT SAN FRANCISCO

03:14:54.015 --> 03:14:56.751
STATE YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF

03:14:56.818 --> 03:15:00.388
CLASSES HUNDREDS. SO IT CAN'T BE

03:15:00.455 --> 03:15:03.792
THIS THIS THIS ONLY AND IT'S A

03:15:03.858 --> 03:15:06.961
DISCIPLINE IT'S NOT A TOPIC IT'S

03:15:07.028 --> 03:15:09.264
NOT THE STUDY OF ETHNICITY. IT

03:15:09.330 --> 03:15:11.933
IS THE DISCIPLINE BUILT. FROM

03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:14.302
THE INTELLECTUAL TRADITIONS TO

03:15:14.369 --> 03:15:16.404
ADDRESS THE NEEDS AND

03:15:16.471 --> 03:15:19.240
ASPIRATIONS OF RACIALIZED

03:15:19.307 --> 03:15:23.578
AMERICAN GROUPS OKAY. THAT OF

03:15:23.645 --> 03:15:25.980
COURSE IS GOING TO BE DISCUSSED

03:15:26.047 --> 03:15:29.484
I'M SURE. SO ANOTHER DIFFICULT

03:15:29.551 --> 03:15:31.853
ONE FOR US TO GRAPPLE WITH HIS.

03:15:31.920 --> 03:15:35.256
SOME INCLUDING ME MAY WANT MANY

03:15:35.323 --> 03:15:37.092
WONDERFUL CHANGES IN THE

03:15:37.158 --> 03:15:38.259
CURRICULUM K. THROUGH TWELVE.

03:15:38.326 --> 03:15:44.132
AND WE HAVE AT LEAST SIXTY

03:15:44.199 --> 03:15:46.034
COURSES K. TWELVE STUDENTS TAKE

03:15:46.101 --> 03:15:48.069
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE COURSE

03:15:48.136 --> 03:15:51.139
IN ETHNIC STUDIES. I BELIEVE IT

03:15:51.206 --> 03:15:55.977
INTELLECTUALLY. LIMITING AND A

03:15:56.044 --> 03:15:58.580
RECIPE FOR FAILURE TO TRY TO

03:15:58.646 --> 03:16:01.449
REMEDY EVERYTHING THAT THE

03:16:01.516 --> 03:16:02.283
CURRENT TRADITIONALLY WHAT

03:16:02.350 --> 03:16:05.286
STUDIES CURRICULUM DOESN'T DO IN

03:16:05.353 --> 03:16:08.123
THAT ONE COURSE HOWEVER HE IS

03:16:08.189 --> 03:16:10.825
THE PROMISE AT SAN FRANCISCO

03:16:10.892 --> 03:16:11.893
STATE WITH THE DISCIPLINE WAS

03:16:11.960 --> 03:16:14.596
BORN. IT WAS BORN IT WAS BORN AS

03:16:14.662 --> 03:16:16.397
A MULTI ETHNIC INCLUDING

03:16:16.464 --> 03:16:18.633
PROGRESSIVE WHITES COALITION THE

03:16:18.700 --> 03:16:20.768
DECIDED WHAT IT NEED TO BE AND

03:16:20.835 --> 03:16:23.838
THEN ITS ENERGY BURST WOMEN'S

03:16:23.905 --> 03:16:25.707
STUDIES QUEER STUDIES JEWISH

03:16:25.773 --> 03:16:27.075
STUDIES PERSIAN STUDIES

03:16:27.142 --> 03:16:28.943
DISABILITY STUDIES. IT GOES THE

03:16:29.010 --> 03:16:31.246
OTHER WAY AROUND. YOU PLANT THE

03:16:31.312 --> 03:16:34.449
FIRST SEED AND YOU GROW THE REST

03:16:34.516 --> 03:16:38.219
OF THE PLANTS THE THIRD THIS IS

03:16:38.286 --> 03:16:39.487
GOING TO BE CHALLENGING BECAUSE

03:16:39.554 --> 03:16:41.122
WE'RE JUST STARTING. IT ALWAYS

03:16:41.189 --> 03:16:43.024
IS GETTING BACK TO EXERCISE.

03:16:43.091 --> 03:16:46.227
IT'S HARD BUT ETHNIC STUDIES

03:16:46.294 --> 03:16:48.663
FACULTY HAVE ALREADY CREATED

03:16:48.730 --> 03:16:51.199
MODELS OF TEACHING ETHNIC

03:16:51.266 --> 03:16:53.968
STUDIES IN THE HIGH SCHOOL THEY

03:16:54.035 --> 03:16:55.770
HAVE BEEN INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED

03:16:55.837 --> 03:16:57.739
AS NOT JUST GOOD INTELLECTUAL

03:16:57.805 --> 03:17:00.508
QUALITY WHICH IS ALL IT REALLY

03:17:00.575 --> 03:17:02.577
SHOULD HAVE TO PROMISE BUT AS

03:17:02.644 --> 03:17:05.947
SUCCESS AS MOTIVATORS OF SUCCESS

03:17:06.014 --> 03:17:08.983
AND ACHIEVEMENT FOR STUDENTS OF

03:17:09.050 --> 03:17:12.720

THE CHAPTER CHAIR FOR PATRICK

03:20:04.892 --> 03:20:06.194
COUNTY MOM COOPER MCCARTY AND

03:20:06.260 --> 03:20:11.632
I'M ALSO A MEXICAN AMERICAN. AND

03:20:11.699 --> 03:20:13.835
I FEEL LIKE I'VE LISTENED TO THE

03:20:13.901 --> 03:20:15.837
TESTIMONY. AND AS A MEXICAN

03:20:15.903 --> 03:20:17.972
AMERICAN WOMAN I KNOW WHERE I

03:20:18.039 --> 03:20:20.441
CAME FROM I KNOW MY ROOTS AND I

03:20:20.508 --> 03:20:22.443
KNOW MY CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY

03:20:22.510 --> 03:20:25.079
I ALSO SEE THE DISMAL STATE OF

03:20:25.146 --> 03:20:27.215
AFFAIRS THAT IS THE EDUCATIONAL

03:20:27.281 --> 03:20:28.483
SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA I BELIEVE

03:20:28.549 --> 03:20:30.585
WE'RE- CURRENTLY RANKED LAST IN

03:20:30.651 --> 03:20:34.155
EDUCATION. I ATTENDED SOME OF

03:20:34.222 --> 03:20:36.691
THE WORST PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN SOME

03:20:36.758 --> 03:20:38.292
OF THE WORST NEIGHBORHOODS IN

03:20:38.359 --> 03:20:41.095
CALIFORNIA AND MY SCHOOL HIGH

03:20:41.162 --> 03:20:43.765
SCHOOL DROP OUT RATE WITH FIFTY

03:20:43.831 --> 03:20:45.500
PERCENT- WE WERE PREDOMINANTLY

03:20:45.566 --> 03:20:47.135
MINORITIES. WE WERE NOT

03:20:47.201 --> 03:20:49.704
GRADUATING BECAUSE OF LACK OF

03:20:49.771 --> 03:20:50.371
ETHNIC STUDIES WE ARE NOT

03:20:50.438 --> 03:20:53.474
GRADUATING BECAUSE WE HAD A LACK

03:20:53.541 --> 03:20:54.942
OF QUALIFIED TEACHERS I THINK

03:20:55.009 --> 03:20:56.344
THAT THE EDUCATE HIGHER

03:20:56.411 --> 03:20:57.278
EDUCATION NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED

03:20:57.345 --> 03:20:59.313
MORE ON PREPARING THE TEACHERS

03:20:59.380 --> 03:21:01.616
TO EDUCATE TODAY'S YOUTH. AND

03:21:01.682 --> 03:21:04.685
LAST ON RACIAL INEQUALITY WELL

03:21:04.752 --> 03:21:06.521
THEY DO HAPPEN. THEY'RE NOT AT

03:21:06.587 --> 03:21:08.189
THE FOREFRONT OF MOST CHILDREN'S

03:21:08.256 --> 03:21:11.659
MINDS AND THEY'RE NOT HOLDING

03:21:11.726 --> 03:21:13.394
CHILDREN BACK. AT I THINK THE

03:21:13.461 --> 03:21:15.163
BEST EXAMPLE OF ETHNIC STUDIES

03:21:15.229 --> 03:21:16.898
IS TO ACTUALLY BE ETHNIC PEOPLE

03:21:16.964 --> 03:21:18.533
STUDYING WHICH COMES FROM

03:21:18.599 --> 03:21:21.302
QUALIFIED TEACHERS. AND

03:21:21.369 --> 03:21:24.372
EDUCATING CHILDREN ON THE BASICS

03:21:24.439 --> 03:21:27.074
OF READING WRITING. ANALOGICAL

03:21:27.141 --> 03:21:30.111
REASONING SKILLS AND IF WE HOLD

03:21:30.178 --> 03:21:32.447
THE STANDARDS WITHOUT IN

03:21:32.513 --> 03:21:34.515
THIRTEEN RACE AND ETHNICITY AND

03:21:34.582 --> 03:21:35.683
ETHNIC STUDIES AND PICKING

03:21:35.750 --> 03:21:40.188
CURRICULUM THAT THE CHILDREN.

03:21:40.254 --> 03:21:41.289
THE CHILDREN ALL RIGHT THE

03:21:41.355 --> 03:21:42.557
OCCASION WE WILL SEE MORE
