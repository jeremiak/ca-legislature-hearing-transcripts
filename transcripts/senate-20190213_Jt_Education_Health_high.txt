JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING OF THE SENATE. HEALTH IN THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEES AND ON AND IMPLEMENTATION IMPLEMENTING AND FUNDING FOR THE CONTROL REGULATE AND TAX ADULT USE OF MARIJUANA ACCESS -- YOUTH EDUCATION PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT ACCOUNT AND WHILE WELCOME EVERYONE HERE AND I'M LIKE. THE ONE I THINK -- MY CHAIR I CO CHAIR FOR THE SE HEARING I COUNTY LEAVE A AND IT. TEACHING COMMITTEE AS WELL BEING HERE AS YOU KNOW -- PROP SIXTY FOUR IN TWENTY SIXTEEN CREATE THE YOUTH EDUCATION PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT ACCOUNT WHICH MAKE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO VERY STATE DEPARTMENTS. FOR PROGRAMS FOR USE WITH OR AT RISK OF DEVELOPING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. IT'S BEEN SEVERAL YEARS NOW -- SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PROP SIXTY FOUR AND NO FUNDS HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE FOR THE USER ACCOUNT. SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HEAR. NGUYEN FUND ABOUT EXAMPLES OF SERVICES THAT ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR USE AS WELL AS SERVICE GAPS THAT MAY BE ADDRESSED BY ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND THE WORK HAS BEEN DONE TO DATE TO PREPARE FOR FOR WHEN THE FUNDS ARE MADE AVAILABLE. THE GOAL IS TO GAIN A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WELL THE VARIOUS ENTITIES HAVE BEEN COLLABORATING AND TO IDENTIFY AREAS THAT MAY NEED IMPROVEMENT. AND SO WITH THAT -- ONE NOW INVITE. CENTERS LEYVA CHAIR OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE TO ALSO US A FEW WORDS THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE FOR THE HEARING TODAY. I'M VERY PLEASED THAT WE'RE GONNA BE FOCUSING OUR ATTENTION ON THE USE OF PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR FUNDS THAT WILL BE DEDICATED TO PROGRAMS FOR WHICH YOUTH. FOR YOUTH WHICH WILL EMPHASIZE EDUCATION PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION AND SCHOOL RETENTION THIS TOPIC IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ERA OF LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA AND THE OPIOID CRISIS. AS A MEMBER OF BOTH EDUCATION AND HEALTH COMMITTEES I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED. IN HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WILL COMMUNICATE AND COORDINATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO DEVELOP A YOUTH FACING INTERAGENCY. AGREEMENT THAT BUILDS UPON EXISTING LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURES AND PROGRAMS. AND OTHER ANY OTHER MEMBERS THAT WANT TO MAKE ANY OPENING REMARKS. ALL RIGHT DOCTOR PANEL TOBACCO VIDEO. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER LEYVA SO WE'RE GONNA FIRST BEGIN WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE YOUTH EDUCATION PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT ACCOUNT AND I LIKE TO INVITE OUT. CLINT CALLUM ASSISTANT PROGRAM BUDGET MANAGER FROM THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. AND SONYA PROTECT. THE FRANTIC CORRECTLY -- FROM THAT SENIOR FISCAL POLICY ANALYST AT THE LET WITH THIS ACCOUNTS ABOUT. A WELCOME THANK. HI COMPOUND APARTMENT A FINANCE AND MY TESTIMONY TODAY WILL JUST PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE EXISTING CANNABIS RELATED -- FUNDING STRUCTURE TO KIND OF BE ABLE TO SEE HOW. TO USE. EDUCATION PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT ACCOUNT FITS INTO THAT. SO THERE'S TWO MAIN FUNDING SOURCES THERE'S A CANNABIS CONTROL FINE WHICH RECEIVES REVENUETHROUGH REGULATORY FEES ON THE LICENSED MARKET -- IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE EXPECT ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO BE SPENT FROM THAT FIND IN IT MAINLY FUNDS THE THREE MAIN LICENSING ENTITIES. CANNABIS CONTROL DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE -- FOR TODAY'S DISCUSSION THE NEXT ONE'S MORE RELEVANT -- IS THE CAMPUS TAX FUND. IT GENERATES REVENUE ON A 15% EXCISE TAX ON RETAIL SALES CANNABIS ANNA CULTIVATION TAX WHICH IS BASED ON A PER OUNCE WEIGHT OF THE PLANT ARE CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE PLAN. AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ARE CANNABIS EXCISE TAX REVENUE -- IS IT SHOWS THAT WERE EXPECTED TO GENERATE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND GIVEN THAT TO NEWLY CREATED MARKET THESE REVENUE PROJECTIONS OR IS SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY. PROP SIXTY FOUR ACTUALLY LAID OUT HOW. CANNABIS TAX FUNDS WERE INTENDED TO BE SPENT IN GENERAL TERMS THERE'S THREE MAIN ALLOCATIONS AND THEY'RE IN PRIORITY ORDER -- ALLOCATION ONE IS GOING TO REGULATORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. INITIALLY WERE YOU REPAYING GENERAL FUND LOANS THAT WERE USED WHILE NO -- THE REVENUE -- TO IMPLEMENT THE TWENTY MARKET WHILE REVENUE WAS UNAVAILABLE. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO A TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURES WE EXPECT IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FOR OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE AND REGULAR COURT REGULATORY COSTS. THEN THERE'S ALLOCATION TO WHERE THEY SPECIFIED SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNTS TO GO TO CERTAIN RESEARCH AND OTHER PROGRAMS WE EXPECT THAT TOTAL TO BE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR A GRANT PROGRAM TO PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES TO STUDY THERE -- A FACT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR IN THE OVERALL EFFECTIVE LEGALIZING -- CANNABIS THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR SEATS P. RELATED TO IMPAIRED DRIVING IDENTIFICATION TRAINING AND BEST PRACTICES TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO GO BAY IS FOR A COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT PROGRAM IN TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO UC SAN DIEGO CENTER FOR MEDICINAL CANNABIS RESEARCH. AND THEN FINALLY -- WE GET TO ALLOCATION THREE WHICH IS OF INTEREST TODAY. AND BASICALLY THE WAY THE INITIATIVE WORKS IS THAT IT LOOKS AT REVENUE IN A GIVEN YEAR AND THEN IT COVERS THE EXPENDITURES AND ALLOCATION ONE INTO AND THEN WHATEVER'S REMAINING. IT MAKES AVAILABLE FOR ALLOCATIONS THREE IN THE PRECEDING FISCAL YEAR SO WE EXPECT IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO HUNDRED SIXTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO BE AVAILABLE IN TOTAL FOR ALLOCATION THREE PROGRAMS -- BUT AGAIN AS I POINTED OUT THAT THAT'S BASED ON OUR OUR REVENUES TODAY WHICH IS SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY. AND 20% OF THAT REVENUE GOES TO ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION PROTECTION ACCOUNT. WHICH IS TO BE USED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION FOR REMEDIATION EFFORTS. RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE FROM CANNABIS THERE PROGRAMS THIS INCLUDE COULD INCLUDE PREVENTION AND ENFORCEMENT RELATED TO ILLEGAL CANNABIS GROW SOME PUBLIC LANDS. 20% TO THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNT WHICH WOULD GO TO C. H. P. ACTIVITIES SIMILAR TO THOSE A SCRIBE ABOUT AND MAYBE A GRANT PROGRAM LATEST THAT. IT ALSO GO TO THE BOARD OF STATE COMMITTEE CORRECTIONS FOR AND SEND TO SEND MONEY TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVEN'T BAND -- CANNABIS RETAIL SELLER CULTIVATION FOR PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES AND FINALLY -- FOR TODAY'S DISCUSSION 60% OF THAT -- ALLOCATION THREE WOULD GO TO THE YOUTH EDUCATION PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT ACCOUNT -- WHICH WOULD -- GO TO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AN APARTMENT EDUCATION ON SUBSTANCE USE RELATED -- TREATMENT PREVENTION AND EDUCATION -- THAT'S THE CONCLUSION OF MY COMMENTS AND HAPPY ON ANSWERING QUESTIONS. PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN CHAIR AND SENATORS I'M SEND YOU PICK FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND I'M ALSO JOINED BY MY COLLEAGUE MARK NEWTON WHO IS THE DEPUTY LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AT THE LA -- MY COMMENTS TODAY WILL OFFER SOME OVER ARCHING THOUGHTS ON THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE IN IMPLEMENTING -- THE USE ACCOUNT. AND TO THAT END ALL FIRST DISCUSS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE UNRESOLVED IN THE LANGUAGE OF GOVERNING THE USE ACCOUNT AND THEN I'LL MOVE ON AND DISCUSS FIVE KEY. ISSUES WE RAISE FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. YOU SHOULD HAVE A HANDOUT ASSOCIATED WITH MY COMMENTS OKAY GREAT. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE WE PROVIDE A LIST OF THE UNRESOLVED ISSUES IN THE YOUTH ACCOUNT LANGUAGE THESE INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE -- THE LANGUAGE IS SILENT ON A SPENDING PRIORITIES FROM AMONG A LOT A LONG LIST OF PERMISSIVE ACTIVITIES IT'S ALSO SILENT ON HOW THE THREE DEPARTMENTS SHOULD WORK TOGETHER. ONE IMPORTANT AREA THAT IT'S SILENT ON IS THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T MENTION THE LEGISLATURE AT ALL. AND IMPORTANTLY IT CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATES THE FUNDS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. DESPITE THIS WE ASSUME THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN USE ITS GENERAL OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY WHEN IT COMES TO IMPLEMENTING THE USE ACCOUNT FUNDS. ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF SOME OF THESE UNRESOLVED ISSUES. AND WE THINK THAT IN DOING THIS -- WHAT IT CAN REALLY DO IS HELP GUIDE THE DECISION MAKING BY THE THREE DEPARTMENTS AND PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR DECISION MAKING? AND WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN BE GUIDED BY SOME OF THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. AND YOU'LL KNOW IN THE HAND OUT THERE'S A NUMBER OF SOMETHING THAT WAS BASED ON A LESSON. LESSON LEARNED FROM PROPOSITION. SIXTY THREE SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE WILL RAISE OUR ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. THE FIRST IS THIS NOTION OF IDENTIFYING OUTCOMES TO ACHIEVE THE LANGUAGE IN PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR IS SILENT ON WHAT OUT SPECIFIC OUTCOMES IT HOPES TO ACHIEVE WITH THE SPENDING OF THE YOUTH ACCOUNTED DEFINITELY IDENTIFIES SOME. A PERMISSIVE ACTIVITIES BUT NOT THE ACTUAL OUTCOMES. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE STATE IN STATUTE THE THREE TO FIVE YOU KNOW SMALL HANDFUL OF OUTCOMES THAT IT HOPES TO ACHIEVE WITH THE SPENDING. AND IDENTIFY MEASURABLE TARGETS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THESE OUTCOMES WE THINK THAT THIS CAN REALLY SET UP A FRAMEWORK FOR DECISION MAKING BY THE DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE THEY'LL FLOW FROM THESE GOALS. SECOND WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE STATE ITS INTENT ON OVERALL PREFERENCES AS WELL AS PREFERENCES FOR HOW IT WANTS TO CONDUCT OVERSIGHT AND WHAT REPORTING IT WANTS TO REQUIRE OF THE THREE DEPARTMENTS -- FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD STATE ITS INTENT TO THAT THE INITIAL FUNDING BE USED FOR EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES ONLY AND THAT EASE PILOT PROGRAMS TO TEST -- PROMISING PRACTICES AND INCLUDE A FORMAL EVALUATION REQUIREMENT. TURNING TO PAGE FOR OUR THIRD ISSUE THAT WE WANTED TO RAISE IS HELLO THE LEGISLATURE COULD FACILITATE ITS OVERSIGHT WITH THE CREATION OF A TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE. WHAT WE SUGGEST HERE IS THAT IT COULD CREATE A SMALL GROUP OF? INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE EXPERTISE IN TECHNICAL ANALYSIS AND AND DATA -- USING DATA. AND WE THINK THAT THIS COMMITTEE CAN HELP LATER IN THE DEPARTMENTS WHEN IT COMES TO IMPORTANT DECISIONS SUCH AS HOW TO SET UP EVALUATIONS FROM THE OUTSET WHAT DO YOU DO NEED TO COLLECT IN ORDER TO DO THOSE EVALUATIONS. IT COULD ALSO HELP ASSESS -- SERVICE NEEDS AND SERVICE GAPS. I'M TURNING TO PAGE FIVE OUR FOURTH -- ISSUE WE WANTED TO RAISE IS. HOW TO RESOLVE SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT WERE LEFT UNRESOLVED IN THE LANGUAGE -- THERE'S SOME DECISIONS THAT MAY NEED TO BE. CONSIDERED AT THE OUTSET SO FOR EXAMPLE AND THIS IS A LESSON LEARNED FROM PROPOSITION. SIXTY THREE HOW DO YOU WANT TO HANDLE UNSPENT FUNDS BY FOR EXAMPLE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SHOULD THEY BE ALLOWED TO KEEP A RESERVE WHEN SHOULD THE FUNDS RESERVE REVERT BACK TO THE STATE -- THERE ALSO DECISIONS THAT SHOULD BE MADE ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO FOR EXAMPLE. AND THIS IS ANOTHER LESSON LEARNED FROM PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE WE THINK THAT DETERMINING THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PREVENTION ACTIVITIES VERSUS TREATMENT ACTIVITIES IS GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND RATHER THAN LOCKING IN THOSE PROPORTIONAL ALLOCATIONS WE THINK THAT THIS SHOULD BE A FLEXIBLE DECISION IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD. REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENTS TO RECONSIDER ON AND MAYBE AN ON A REGULAR BASIS AND PERHAPS ANNUALLY WITH GUIDANCE FROM THE TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE. AM BASED ON LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PREVIOUS ACTIVITIES. ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING THAT WILL NEED TO BE CONSIDERED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IS WHETHER THE FUNDING SHOULD BE -- ALLOCATED VIA COMPETITIVE GRANTS OR FUNDING FORMULAS AND ON THIS WE THINK THERE MAY BE ROOM FOR BOTH SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN EVIDENCE ON A PARTICULAR. ISSUE IS SPARSE IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE IF TRANSPORTATION OUT -- PROMISING PRACTICES AND THEN CONDUCTED EVALUATION WHEN THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE IN A GIVEN AREA YOU COULD POTENTIALLY USE A FUNDING FORMULA AND PROVIDE SORT OF A MENU OF OPTIONS OF EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER ENTITIES COULD USE. FINALLY OUR LAST POINT THAT WE WANTED TO RAISE IS THAT THERE WILL BE WORK FORCE NEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH -- IMPLEMENTING THE USE ACCOUNT FUNDS WE THINK THAT -- ASSESSING IN PLANNING FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IS AN ACTIVITY THAT SHOULD HAPPEN AT THE STATE LEVEL BECAUSE STATEWIDE NEEDS COULD BE -- BETTER ASSESS THAT WAY WE ALSO THINK THAT THE DEPARTMENTS IT WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR THE DEPARTMENTS TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON ANY STATUTE THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT SAY AN INCENTIVE PROGRAMMER OR LOAN FORGIVENESS THAT TYPE OF THING. SO WTHOUT I'M ALSO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES CENTER STONE. ALL THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND YOU CERTAINLY OUTLINED SOME OF THE EMISSIONS IF YOU WILL. OF INITIATIVES SO. THE FIRST THING THAT I THINK WE WE CERTAINLY NEED -- TO IDENTIFYING TACKLE IS -- THE DEFINITION OF YOUTH. AND I'M ONLY SPEAKING FROM SOME OF OUR EXPERIENCES ON THE COMMITTEE WE ARE WE CAN LOOK A CHRONOLOGICAL AGE OR WE CAN LOOK AT BRAIN MATURATION AND BRING NATURAIS XIN SEEMS TO BE -- A PREDOMINANT FACTOR -- RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE BRAIN DOESN'T FULLY DEVELOP UNTIL TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD. AND SO -- I WOULD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER DEFINITION OF TWENTY FIVE YEARS -- FOR YOUNGER -- IDENTIFYING OUTCOMES I THINK IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT -- EDUCATING OUR YOUTH ABOUT THE THE INTOXICATION HAZARDS OF OF CANNABIS ESPECIALLY WHEN. GETTING BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A CAR FORCING A LOT. MORE KIDS AND ADULTS FOR THAT MATTER -- BEING ARRESTED FOR D. WHY IS DRIVING UNDER THE THE DOCKS CATION OF OF CANNABIS. AND AND CERTAINLY -- EDUCATING OUR KIDS ABOUT THE SYNERGY. OF OTHER DRUGS INCLUDING ALCOHOL WHEN MIXED WITH -- WITH CANNABIS. AND AND ALSO THE HAZARDS OF CONSUMING EDIBLES NOT UNDERSTANDING THE CONCENTRATION OF CANNABIS THAT IS IN THOSE ARTICLES BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT. I DON'T THERE'S ONE REPORTED CASE OF ANYBODY -- DYING FROM AN OVERDOSE OF INHALED CANNABIS BUT THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES ESPECIALLY AND AND CHILDREN OF PEOPLE EATING APPLES AND SING ON UNFORTUNATE DEATH SO. MR SURE HOW THIS WILL WORK TO ARE WE ARE WE LOOKING FOR A BILL TO CLARIFY LANGUAGE OR HOW HOW DOES THE LEGISLATURE -- PLACE THEIR INPUT BASED ON A CONSENSUS OF THE COMMITTEES OF CAN I CAN I WEBER TORTURED ASKING EVERYONE BECAUSE I'M LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER BUT WILL. EXPLAIN. AS I CAN LOOK AT THE ROLE THE ROLE OF US AS IT HAD A COMMITTEE TO TRYING -- TO FILLING THESE GAPS OF INFORMATION TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THINGS ARE DEFINED OUR GOALS ARE -- OUR FOR OUR FULLY OUTLINED WHAT ARE THE STEPS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ENACT THESE -- THESE VOIGTS IN THE AN INITIATIVE. IT'S WE WE DID CONSIDER THE ISSUE IN DEPTH IN ONE AND BELIEVE THAT THE HANDLING THIS PROCESS THROUGH POLICY BILLS PROBABLY MAKES THE MOST SENSE. AND NOW IT'S A PART OF THE REASON WE'RE DOING THIS -- INFORMATIONAL HEARING IS TO START TO GET THE OUTLINES WILL BE HEARING FROM -- ADVOCATES AND AGENCIES AS WELL AND THEY MAY HAVE SOME IDEAS TO BUT VERY SECURITY SEE THIS IS A A BILL OF THE COMMITTEE ALL COME VERY IDEAS AND TESTIMONY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD UNDERTAKE AS MOBILE THE EIGHTH -- LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU HAVE A THE SAID AFTER AFTER THIS HEARING SEE WHAT DIRECTION SO. THAT'S IN THE COMPARATIVE BUT PEOPLE SUGGESTIONS ALWAYS OPEN TO THOSE CELL THANK YOU I MEAN AND OF YES I'M SORRY I WAS JUST GOING. TO MAKE ONE MORE COMMENT ABOUT THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO DO TO IS WHEN YOU HAVE VERY SPECIFIC IDEAS ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF POLICIES YOU WANNAPUT FORTH AND CUT CONSULTING WITH LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL AT THAT POINT TO DETERMINE WILL WHAT'S ALLOWED WHAT CAN WE DO. WHAT A THREE DO WE HAVE MIGHT MAKE SENSE? THANK YOU SO MUCH CAN I MAKE WHAT SIR CAN I MAKE ONE MORE COMMENT TO ABOUT -- THE ISSUE YOU RAISED ON THE DEFINITION OF USE. WE AGREE THAT THAT DEFINITION SHOULD PROBABLY BE KEPT BROAD BECAUSE THIS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CONF AFFECT A WIDE RANGE. OF AGES AND WE IN FACT RECOMMEND WHAT THE LEGISLATURE STATING ITS INTENT THAT. THAT YOUTH BE KEPT THE DEFINITION BE KEPT VERY FINDING THAT IT'S TWENTY FIVE OR UNDER BUT IF YOU'VE ESTABLISHED THAT FRAMEWORK OF OUTCOMES THAT YOU HOPE TO ACHIEVE. THEN THE THE SPENDING DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE SHOULD TARGET THOSE GOALS SO WHATEVER THE AGE MIGHT BE I MEAN PERHAPS SOMEONE COMES IN JUST OVER TWENTY FIVE AND YEAH. THANK YOU CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU TO THE CO CHAIRS FOR CONVENING THIS SESSIONFOR THE OVERVIEW -- EVIL PROVIDED. I THINK SPRY FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT FOR ANYONE --% YOU MENTION KIND OF THE THREE CATEGORIES FOR THE TAX REVENUES ARE DISTRIBUTED. WITH THE CATEGORY THREE BEING A REMAINDER OF WHAT'S LEFT OVER AFTER YOU FILL CATEGORIES ONE INTO. AND THEN YOU PROJECTED BUT SAID WITHOUT PRECISION TO HONORED SIX MILLION PROJECTED. FOR NINETEEN TWENTY HAVE WE COLLECTED REVENUES ALREADY IN THIS CATEGORY THREE SINCE THE LEGALIZATION IN THE SALE. OF CANNABIS PRODUCTS SO -- WE'VE COLLECTED THREE QUARTERS SO FIRE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TO THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS -- IS THAT TOTAL OR SENT FOR THIS CATEGORY THAT'S TOTAL I DON'T HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THE SPECIFICS AND WHETHER WE'VE REACHED A LEVEL WHERE WE'VE PAID ONE INTO TO REACHED CATEGORY -- THREE BUT YOU KNOW -- EX I BELIEVE WE'RE CLOSE TO GETTING TO A POINT WHERE THE NEXT TAX -- PAYMENTS MADE WILL ACTUALLY START FUNNELING INTO ALLOCATION. THREE FOR NINETEEN TWENTY BUT WE'RE STILL COLLECTING IN THIS BUDGET YEAR AND WE CAN HIT THAT TRIGGER IN THIS BUDGET YEAR POTENTIALLY. RIGHT SO THE FINAL TAX PAYMENT ACTUALLY FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WILL BE THE END OF JULY SO IT'S EVEN SORT OF FURTHER IN EVERY YEARS IN THAT YOU IT WILL BE A PAYMENT MADE AFTER THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR THAT APPLIES. TO EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND WHATEVER'S AVAILABLE AT THAT POINT -- WOULD GO TO THESE ALLOCATION THREE PROGRAMS INTO THE THREE CATS -- PERCENTAGES THAT ARE BROKEN DOWN. THANK YOU IN IN JUST A BRIEF COMMENT FROM. I DO THINK THIS WORKIS CRITICAL IN THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD EXERCISE KEEN OVERSIGHT IN SHAPING -- YOUTH EDUCATION IN I THINK THE LA -- SUGGESTED NOT TYING OURSELVES INTO ALLOCATIONS BETWEEN PREVENTION AND TREATMENT. THEY'RE BOTH OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE. THE BETTER JOB WITH HIM PREVENTION THE LESS WE HAVE TO DO IN TREATMENT. AND JUST TO GET ON THE HORIZON AS WE MOVE FORWARD -- LOOKING AT THE NEXUS BETWEEN THE VAPING PRODUCTS THAT KIDS ARE USING IN SCHOOLS NOW. FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND THOSE DEVICES ARE ALSO USED -- FOR MARIJUANA CANNABIS IN ELATION IN I KNOW FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH POINT OF VIEW WITH MADE SUCH TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN REDUCING. FIRST TIME TOBACCO USERS WITH. IN THIS VIRTUALLY ALL BEEN ERASED AND REVERSED NOW WITH VAPING. LIVING NICOTINE TO SCHOOL KIDS ONLINE SIX HUGE PROBLEM IN OUR PUB IN ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS -- BUT JUST TO POINT OUT THERE IS A NEXUS OF KIDS BEING INTRODUCED TO THE VAPING PRODUCTS THAT'S ALSO -- MAKES THE CANNABIS PRODUCTS ACCESSIBLE SO IS PART OF OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION -- HOW CAN WE PARTNER WITH THOSE THAT ARE TRYING TO DO? TOBACCO REDUCTION EDUCATION -- JUST JUST AS A THOUGHT SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I THINK YOU JUST MOVED TO WITH REGARD TO REVENUE ASSET CHRISTINE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO WE WE EXPECT -- TO FIND OUT SAID WHAT REVENUES WERE COLLECTED FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF THIS FISCAL YEAR AT SOMETIME WITHIN THE COMING DAYS -- IF THE ERROR OF THAT BUT SO FAR ARE AT THIS MOMENT ALL THAT WE'RE AWARE OF IS -- REVENUE THAT WAS COLLECTED FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR AS WELL AS STANDARD THE PRIVATE LAST HALF OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR END. AND COUNTING ONLY THAT REVENUE TO DATE -- YOU JUST FROM THAT FIRST QUARTER THE FISCAL YEAR IT STILL REMAINS SORT OF ON CERTAIN CERTAINLY NOT GUARANTEED WHETHER THERE WOULD BE. REVENUE AVAILABLE FOR THE YOUTH ACCOUNT -- IS THERE THERE WOULD BE AS AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTED BY THING THAT'LL DEPEND CRUCIALLY ON SHOULD THE NEXT COUPLE OF OF REVENUE UPDATES -- WHETHER THERE WILL BE REVENUE AVAILABLE FOR THE ACCOUNT AND IF SO HOW MUCH. I THINK TO HELP ILLUSTRATE THIS A LITTLE BIT BETTER -- TO IF YOU LOOK. WE HAVE A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND LOANS THAT NEED TO BE REPAID WE HAVE ABOUT FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL ALLOCATIONS FROM ALLOCATION ONE INTO THAT NEED TO BE PAID. NINETEEN NINETEEN WE'VE RCEIVED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO DATE WHICH DOESN'T INCLUDE THIS TAX PAYMENT THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO RECEIVE. SO IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THIS NEXT TAX PAYMENT WILL LIKELY COVER THE ALLOCATION ONE INTO COSTS AND WILL START TO BEGIN TO SEE. RAINY REALLOCATION AND MISTER CHAIRMAN JUST REACT TO THAT QUICKLY -- THIS CONSTRUCTION IS INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS CATEGORY. THREE REQUIRES FILLING THE FIRST TWO BUCKETS FIRST AND SO IN TERMS OF PREDICTING WHAT YOU HAVE. TO DO ADVANCE PLANNING ON PREVENTION OR TREATMENT PROGRAMS -- IT'S REALLY KIND OF AN IMPERFECT STRUCTURE. FROM MY POINT OF VIEW FOR BEING ABLE TO DO. SOUND INVESTMENT PLANNING WHEN YOU'RE WAITING EACH YEAR TO SEEN. QUITE WHAT MIGHT SPILL OVER INTO THAT CATEGORY THREE I KNOW THIS ISN'T YOUR CREATION. YOU ARE BOUND TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT WITH US BUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD IDEAS. MAYBE AT SOME OF THE RESEARCH THAT GOES ON WITH SOME OF THIS MONEY BUT HOW DO WE GET BETTER PROJECTING. ANTICIPATED TAX REVENUES SO THAT THERE COULD POTENTIALLY BE COMMITMENTS ARE ADVANCE LOANS MADE FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO TO MAKE SURE WE WE ARE FULLY. PROMOTING THE EDUCATION PREVENTION AND REATMENT PROGRAMS AND NOT. HOLDING IMPLEMENTATION IN ABEYANCE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT WE'RE GONNA GET SO I KNOW IF THERE'S A PRESIDENT FOR THAT KIND OF LOAN AND ON SOME AMOUNT KNOWING THAT. YOU'LL GET SOMETHING THERE BUT YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT IT IS -- THAT WOULD ALLOW. FOR PLANNERS AND IMPLEMENTERS TO MOVE FORWARD SO. JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THAT. YEAH I POINTS WELL TAKEN -- ANYTHING COURSE STILL SORT OF WORKING THROUGH THOSE DETAILS I DO THINK THAT AT LEAST THREE QUARTERS OF THE PRIOR YEAR'S TAX PAYMENTS WILLBE IN BEFORE THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. SO WE'LL HAVE ONE TAX PAYMENT THAT TAKES PLACE AFTER -- AND I THINK AS THE MARKET MATURES I'M ASSUMING THE BE MORE STABILITY IN THOSE PROJECTIONS -- BUT IT UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT'S A CHALLENGE THAT THE DEPARTMENTS WILL HAVE -- TO UNDERTAKE. YES ASSN RUBIO THANK YOU. FORGIVE ME FIGHT AND SEE IT AND SOME OF THE PAPERWORK THAT YOU PROVIDE IT BUT I'M JUST A LITTLE CURIOUS I KNOW IT'S AND YOU INDUSTRY AND THERE'S A LOT OF UNKNOWNS. I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW WE ARE GOING TO RECRUIT MORE PEOPLE TO GO INTO THESE PROFESSIONS IN TERMS OF THE THE MENTAL HEALTH -- WELLNESS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS I'M JUST ONE SIR CAN WE USE FUNDING FOR LIKE LOAN FORGIVENESS. PROGRAMS TO GOING TO THESE FIELDS I CAN ONLY IMAGINE. THE PROBLEM I GONNA GET BIGGER AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE THE USE OF CANNABIS AT A MORE AND MORE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU PERSON I COME FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHERE WE WE DID GET ABOUT FIFTEEN PERMITS AND WE ARE STARTING TO SEE -- SOME OF THE UNANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE PERMITS AND SO. WE'RE TRYING TO SEE A LOT MORE USE OF CANNABIS OUT IN THE OPEN AND KIDS FALLING PREY. TO TO THE USE OF CANNABIS A PERHAPS IS NOT TO A QUALITY I DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT CANNABIS BED. SO MY POINT IS I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED A LOT MORE PROFESSIONALS IN THIS INDUSTRY HOW TO WEEK. PROMOTED HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE THEM AND DOT CAN WE USE SOME OF THAT FUNDING FOR LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS FOR THEM TO GO INTO THE FIELD. AND BECOME EXPERTS IN THIS ARENA. YES WE AGREE THAT THERE IS -- SOME UNMET NEEDS IN THIS AREA WE DON'T HAVE NUMBERS ON HOW MANY NEW PROFESSIONALS WE WOULD NEED TO IMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS BUT THE TYPES OF PROFESSIONALS THAT WILL BE NEEDED CAN RANGE FROM. YOU KNOW PRIVATE TRAINING FOR PRIMARY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO SCHOOL COUNSELORS TO NURSES TO EVEN SUPPORT SPECIALIST. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE RECOMMEND THAT THE THE LEGISLATURE -- WORK WITH THE THREE DEPARTMENTS TO DEVELOP SERVICE STATEWIDE STRATEGY TO INCREASE -- TRAINING AND WORK FORCE IN THIS AREA. AND THAT COULD CERTAINLY INCLUDE -- LOAN FORGIVENESS OR SOME. AND THAT MIGHT BE WERE THE LEGISLATURE CAN REALLY HELP THE THREE DEPARTMENTS IN IN ACTING STATUTETHAT FACILITATES THAT THANK. QUESTIONS OKAY SIDE AND IF COUPLE QUESTIONS IN A FOLLOW UP AND SO DID TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE YOU MAY NOTE THAT -- YOU KNOW THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF DIFFERENT. THAT DESERVE PERMISSION WE COULD USE SOME HELP WITH WHAT WOULD YOU SEE THE TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE RESIDING YOU TALK ABOUT. ITS RESULTING LEGISLATORS OVERSIZE AT THE PART OF THE LEGISLATURE PART ADMINISTRATION WERE WORRIES. BUT FENNELL AS PERSPECTIVE -- WHERE WOULD YOU SEE THE -- THE BETTER THE AT THIS TECHNICAL VISOR COMMITTEE BEST BEING SITUATED. YEAH I KNOW THAT SIR THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND I THINK THAT -- FOR SOME OF THOSE TYPES OF DETAILS IF IT'S AN ISSUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE WE WOULD BE HAPPY. TO WORK WITH YOU TO EXPLORE THE THE VARIOUS OPTIONS BUT WE REALLY SAW THIS AS A COMMITTEE THAT COULD. REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT ALSO HELP -- DEPARTMENTS WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO. HAVEN'T QUITE WORKED OUT HOW THOSE DETAILS AND WOULDN'T DO YOU EVER OF TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES ARE PART OF THE LA L.. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A HIS YOU ARE OUR ADVISORS AND MANY OF THESE ALL WILL. BUT ONE MASSIVE ADVISORY COMMITTEE YES. THINK ABOUT IT IS I I JUST FEEL WORK -- AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE FOR FINANCES IS THAT -- SO I APPRECIATE THAT WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW IT SO THAT'S OF BASICALLY YOU AND SILENCE A WELL WE HAVE X. NUMBER DOLLARS. IN THIS ACCOUNT WE DO THIS ANNUALLY ANY. AND AND SAY THAT NOW WE HAVE THIS MUCH MONEY FOR PART THREE FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR WHEN WE FIND OUT DID MAKE THAT DETERMINATION WE HAVE. EX NUMBER OF DOLLARS FOR FOR THIS FUND. THAT IS SO THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I DON'T THINK A KNOW WITH PRECISION THE ANSWER TO THAT GIVEN THAT WE HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED MONEY TO THIS THIRD ALLOCATION YET BUT WE DO. SO -- PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR REQUIRES THAT WE SUBMIT A LETTER TO THE CONTROLLER BY JUNE FIFTEENTH. IN IN THERE WE SORT OF DELINEATE -- ALLOCATION ONE WHAT DEPARTMENTS GET WHAT AMOUNT OF MONEY BECAUSE THAT'S NOT SPECIFIED THEN WE PROVIDE THE ALLOCATION TO CONSISTENT WITH THE INITIATIVE. AND THEN I ENVISION THAT WE WOULD JUST SAY ALLOCATION THREE WOULD SAY WHATEVER'S REMAINING GOES IN THIS PERCENTAGE FORM TO THESE DEPARTMENTS. AND IT WOULDN'T BE UNTIL WE GOT THAT FINAL TAX PAYMENT AT THE END OF THE JOE I THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY KNOW IN TOTAL WHAT THEY HAVE IN A GIVEN YEAR TO SPEND OKAY SO JUST TO CLARIFY THINKING ABOUT OUR BUDGETING PROCESS WE DO OUR GENERAL FUND BUDGET YOU. KNOW HOPEFULLY SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR'S FISCAL YEAR STARTS JULY FIRST BUT IN TERMS OF THIS FUND. THERE'S A LETTER ON JUNE FIFTEENTH FOR THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR RIGHT. FOR THE NEXT FOR THE COMING FISCAL YEAR THE COMING FOR NINETEEN TWENTY BUT IT'S BASED ON THE IDEA OF WHAT WAS SPENT IN EIGHTY NINE OKAY AND WHAT WAS RECEIVED AN H. OKAY. SO THE IDEA OF GOD SORRY BUT IN TERMS OF DETERMINING HOW MUCH MONEY WILL FINALLY LAND IN THE SPOT. THAT THE PROP THREE I GUESS -- DIRECTLY -- YOU WE WOULD KNOW THE FINAL TAXIS IS AND OF JULY SO WE WOULD NOT ACTUALLY KNOW FOR THIS FINE HOW MUCH MONEY EITHER IS MOVING FORWARD UNTIL. TARGET SOMETHING -- RIGHT YES AND AND SO THIS ISN'T A BUDGET ACT SO THEY WOULD GO IN THERE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATE SO THAT AND LETTER IN THE FACT. IS SORT OF OUR BUDGET MECHANISM TO PROVIDE THE DOLLARS TO THE DEPARTMENT'S SO IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T LINE UP PERFECTLY I GUESS WITH OUR BUDGET ACT PROCESS OF IN THEY WOULDN'T KNOW UNTIL ABOUT AUGUST OKAY. BECAUSE PART OF WHAT I'M ALSO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT TIMELINE WISE -- MAYBE QUESTION FOR BOTH OF YOU IS -- HOW THE LEGISLATURE EXERCISES OVERSIGHT OVER? THE SPENDING OF THE SON OF THESE FUNDS RIGHT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY THERE IS SO NOW THE MONEY SHOWS UP WE NOW HAVE A SOME SOME. IN AUGUST. AND DANDER NEEDS TO BE A PROCESS TO I GUESS. SPEND IT AND HOW DOES IT ACT LEGISLATURE EXERCISE OVERSIGHT ABOUT HOW IT'S SPENT. SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA GO THROUGH AN FIGURE OUT THOSE DETAILS I'M AT THE NAY REVISION ON THE ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO SHARE THEIR ALLOCATION THREE PLAN AT THAT TIME. THAT'S NOT DISSIMILAR HOW WE DID IT LAST YEAR TO JUST ALLOCATION THREE PROGRAMS WERE AVAILABLE FOR EXPENDITURE IN -- EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND SO WE'RE WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH ON SORT OF HOW THAT INDEED WILL HAPPEN I THINK IT'S HAPPENED IN THE NORMAL SUBCOMMITTEE ROCESS. BUT IN EFFECT YES WHAT IT WHATEVER GOES INTO THAT LETTER ON JUNE FIFTEENTH SORT OF SOLIDIFIES WHAT THE PLAN IS MOVING FORWARD. AND AT THAT TIME I THINK WE'VE HAD A GOOD IN YOUR MAYBE THE PRECISE DOLLAR AMOUNTS. AND I THINK A CERTAIN THE LA -- OPINIONS ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD EXERCISE OVERSIGHT GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE TIMING OF THE FUNDS AN YEAH THE CENTER PAN MARTIN LA OKAY. I THINK A KEY THE KEY POINT TO RECOGNIZE IS THE THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORITY OF THESE FUNDS SO. SO WELL THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T HAVE ITS TYPICAL BUDGET -- APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORITY THAT OVER SO I CAN BE EXERCISED IN MANY DIFFERENT CONTACTS SO REALLY THIS PROPS WHILE THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE COULD BE INVOLVED -- THIS IS -- PROPS MORE IN IN LINE WITH THE THE POLICY COMMITTEE FUNCTION AND OVERSEEN THROUGH THAT AND AND AND AGAIN OVERSIGHT CAN COME. FIRST AND FOREMOST FROM SETTINGS SORT OF IN STATUTES SORT OF PARAMETERS FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S FOR PREFERENCES AND DIRECTION AND THEN HAVING ONGOING SERVE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS IN TERMS OF HOW WELL THE DEMONSTRATION IS LIVING UP TO THOSE SET THOSE GOALS ACTED WITH THE THE BUDGET. TIMELINE AND THEN ONE OTHER QUESTION FOR FINANCE SAID SAYS -- WE'RE ANTICIPATING WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE THAT WE MAY ACTUALLY HAVE FUNDS -- FOR THIS COMING YEAR -- IS -- BEEN -- ADDED OF THE RING COMMUNICATIONS -- AND I WENT TO A DIRECTION BECAUSE YOU DON'T BUT COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE RELEVANT AGENCIES TO START PLANNING -- FOR THOSE FUNDS -- BECAUSE IT FOR THE MONEY SHOWS UP IT ON BE SITTING ON THEY'RE GOING WELL GEE YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH IT SO AND WHAT. HAVE YOU HAS AS IT BEEN SOME COMMUNICATION WITH THE APPROPRIATE IN SEASON THEY SHOULD START PLANNING. FOR WHAT THE MECHANISMS -- FOR THAT THEY WOULD WE HAVE IT JUST HAD. INITIAL DISCUSSIONS I MEAN THAT THE MOST THESE DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN AWARE FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE SOME FUNDS AT SOME POINT HAVE FROM THE CANNABIS TAX FUN. I'M S I DON'T THINK THEY'LL BE SURPRISED BY THAT BUT SO WE HAVE BEGAN SOME INITIAL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AFFECTED DEPARTMENTS AND WE'RE JUST SORT OF ROLLING THAT INTO OUR SPRING BUDGET DELIBERATION PROCESS. ENVISIONING THAT WE WOULD HAVE A MAJOR REVISION PROPOSAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER OKAY SAID WE ARE GOING TO BE HEARING FROM THE AGENCIES -- LATER ON SO I I ANTICIPATE BASED ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID THAT THEY SHOULD RAISE THE PLANNING THIS OF RABIES SHARING WITH US THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING TO FIGURE OUT THIS OUT. AND I THINK THEIR THERE REALLY IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS BUT AS I STATED I THINK THE MAY REVISION PROPOSAL WILL ACTUALLY SOLIDIFY THOSE DETAILS AND WE OULD WANT TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF THE GOVERNOR ON ANY OF THOSE DETAILS. OKAY BUT IT HAD A COUPLE YEARS PREPARE. I I MEAN I THINK MOST OF THEM ARE AWARE THAT IT'S BEEN OUT THERE BUT I DIDN'T GET MADE IT LEAD THE AMOUNT HAS BEEN UPSET RIGHT NOW HIGHLY -- MOVING ALL AROUND -- A IT AND SO I I YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR PEOPLE TO RECONCILE -- IN SO YEAH IN IN JUST UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANICS OF IT ALL HAS BEEN COMPLICATED EVEN NOT FOR US TO WORK THROUGH AND TRYING. TO GET FOLKS ENGAGED BUT PEOPLE THAT A COUPLE YEARS TO FIGURE THIS OUT. RIGHT WE GO I'M SORRY MR THE CALLER SAID PEOPLE HAVE HAD A COUPLE YEARS TO FIGURE THIS OUT RIGHT. THAT IT THE IT'S THE INITIATIVE HAS BEEN PASSED SINCE NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN LATER. YOU ANY OTHER QUESTION -- YES S. UNDER ALSO ON CAN YOU SUMMARIZE FOR ME THE SOME. SOME OF THESE KEY NUMBERS AND GOT A MALL CONFUSED. SO [inaudible] WE'VE COLLECTED. WHAT AMOUNT OF MONEY? BUT WE HAVEN'T SPENT IT. AND A BECAUSE I HEARD YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT LOANS IN THIS A SO WHAT'S THE AMOUNT COLLECTED AND HOW MUCH HAS BEEN. SPENT. YES I'M I'M I'M HONESTLY I'M MOVING THINGS BETWEEN FISCAL YEARS TO TRY TO PROVIDE A SIMPLE ILLUSTRATION BUT IN. IDEALLY WERE GOING TO SPEND A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ON ALLOCATION ONE INTO IN SUCH A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION OF THAT IS FOR GENERAL FUND LOANS THAT TOOK PLACE IN PRIOR YEARS. WITH CALLS LOANS. TO GET THE REGULATORY A PROGRAM ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE TO STAND UP TO LEGALIZE I CREATE A LEGAL MARKET HOW MUCH IS AT A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION OF THE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT OKAY SO HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION TO GET. THE PROGRAM GOING THOSE TOOK PLACE IN PRIOR YEARS YEAH AND WE'RE REPAYING THAT AS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF REGULATORY COSTS THAT ARE ALLOWABLE UNDER ALLOCATION. ONE OKAY -- AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE ALLOCATION WANT. ONE COST OF TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN. EIGHTEEN NINETY AND THEN IN ADDITION WE HAD TO THAT WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ALLOCATION TO COST IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WHICH GETS US TO THE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION. AND IN TOTAL EXPECTED EXPENDITURES FROM ALLOCATION ONE IN TWO TO DATE AGAIN I'M CROSSING FISCAL YEARS BUT TO JUST SORT OF ILLUSTRATE THIS WE'VE COLLECTED OF ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN CANNABIS TAX FUNDS. SO OUR NEXT PAYMENT. THEORETICALLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS WOULD PAVE FINISH PAYING OFF THAT HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION AND THEN THERE WOULD BE SOME PORTION THAT IN THEORY WOULD BE. APPLICABLE TO ALLOCATION THREE AVAILABLE IN. NINETEEN TWENTY AND WHAT -- WHAT WAS PROJECTED TO BE THE AMOUNT IKNOW LOTS OF ISSUES IMPACT THAT BUT WHAT WAS PROJECTED -- I DON'T KNOW. ORDERLY BREAK DOWN ON THE AMOUNT -- WIN TOTAL WHERE ARE WE CLOSE ARE WE WAY BELOW ARE.

SO THAT WE CAN PREPARE IN TERMS OF THE EDUCATION THAT GOES INTO IT BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN. THE AREAS GRAY BUT IN PRACTICE DOESN'T ALWAYS TRANSLATE ARE WE GOING OUT TO THOSE COMMUNITIES THATARE CURRENTLY. NOW IN AND YOU DON'T HAVE PERMITS AND ARE DOING BUSINESS SO ACTUALLY I CENTER RUBIO. POLISH ICE -- I'D SO IT'S SOUND LIKE WE LACK WHICH EDUCATION PREVENTION EARLY INVENTION.

BY ALSO JUST WANNA BE CAREFUL IN TERMS OF THIS HEARING WHICH I FOCUS ON THIS PARTICULAR ACCOUNT CELL AND IT IS. NOT THANK YOU SORRY WE CHAT OKAY THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION -- ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE GONNA BRING UP BY THE NEXT PANELS -- STAKEHOLDERS EXPERIENCES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OVERSIGHT OF THE FUNDED PROGRAMS SO -- WE HAVE JULIET SENS SOCIAL PROGRAM DIRECTOR TO PREVENTION INSTITUTE DR JIM COOLER ADMINISTRATOR. CALIFORNIA FRIDAY NIGHT LIFE PARTNERSHIP TULARE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND WARN DANIEL SISSY STRATEGY OFFICER COMMUNITY COVERAGE AND RESOURCES. AND SO -- APPRECIATE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL BEING HERE AND FOR SHARING. SOME OF YOUR PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERIENCES THAT MIGHT HELP INFORM OUR STATE AGENCIES WHEN WE FINALLY DO HAVE MONEY COMING IN ABOUT WHAT -- SOME THINGS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO -- CHIEF WITH THAT THIS -- FUNDS THAT THE VOTERS HAVE VOTED TO TO THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR LEYVA JAPAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS JULIE AT SAM'S AND I REPRESENT PREVENTION INSTITUTE. A NATIONAL NON PROFIT WITH OFFICES IN OAKLAND AND LOS ANGELES. WE COLLABORATE WITH COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO ADVANCE COMMUNITY BASED EQUITY FOCUSED INITIATIVES THAT PROMOTE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELL BEING. MY REMARKS TODAY ARE ABOUT WHY IT'S CRITICAL TO FUND PREVENTION VIA THE YOUTH ACCOUNT WITH THE SPECIFIC GOALS OF ADVANCING HEALTH AND RACIAL EQUITY. THERE'S AN OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE THAT WHERE WE LIVE ARE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENTS ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SHAPERS OF HEALTH AND WELL BEING BECAUSE THEY DETERMINE OUR OPPORTUNITIES. WHAT WE ARE EXPOSED TO AND WHAT WE CONSIDER NORMAL OR EXPECTED PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR? INVESTING IN PREVENTION AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL IS HOW WE CAN SHIFT THOSE FORCES IN THE ENVIRONMENT TO MAKE HEALTHY AND SAFE BEHAVIOR IS THE NORM. WILL ALSO PROMOTING HEALING AND RESILIENCE AMONG YOUTH WHO HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING TRAUMA AND MAY BE AT RISK OF SUBSTANCE USE. PREVENTION SPECIFICALLY PRIMARY PREVENTION IS DEFINED AS COMMUNITY LEVEL EFFORTS THAT PROMOTE HEALTHY ENVIRONMENTS AND BEHAVIOR TO PREVENT INJURY BILL. ILLNESS AND INJURY FROM OCCURRING IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND WHEN WE APPLY THIS TO SUBSTANCE USE FUNDING PREVENTION MEANS PREVENTING EXPOSURE TO AND USE OF SUBSTANCES AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE SAME STRATEGIES THAT PREVENT INITIAL USE. ARE ALSO CRITICAL TO SUPPORTING PEOPLE WHO ARE IN TREATMENT AND RECOVERY IN SHORT EVERYONE BENEFITS WHEN ENVIRONMENT SUPPORT HEALTH AND SAFETY. WHEN FUNDING PREVENTION THERE'S SOME CORE ELEMENTS OF A SUCCESSFUL INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS TO KEEP IN MIND? FIRST WE NEED TO FOCUS ON COMMUNITY LEVEL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH SO THOSE ARE FACTORS IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT STRONGLY INFLUENCE HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND OUTCOMES. AND THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF YOU FLED AFTER COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTS. A DESIRE FOR SAFE ACCESS TO PARKS AND OPEN SPACE FOR EXAMPLE HAS LED SOME COMMUNITIES TO FOCUS ON REVITALIZATION OF PARKS. INCLUDING YOUTH DEVELOPED PROGRAMS THAT CAN BE ACCESSED AT PARKS AFTER SCHOOL AND AFTER DARK. PROMOTING SOCIAL CONNECTIONS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. OTHER COMMUNITIES YOU'D HAVE ORGANIZED TO AFFECT CHANGE AROUND WHAT IS SOLD AND PROMOTED WEIGHING IN ON ZONING REGULATIONS AND OTHER POLICIES TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD. AND LIMIT THE REACH OF TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL MARKETING ALONG WITH OTHER PREDATORY BUSINESSES. THESE APPROACHES CAN FOSTER A SENSE OF PURPOSE AND BELONGING FOR YOUTH IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE SECOND ELEMENT IS THAT WE MUST ELEVATE YOUTH LEADERSHIP SET WITHIN THE YOUTH FIND WE CAN SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE GATHERING AND ENGAGING WITH ONE ANOTHER SERVING AS LEADERS AND DEFINING THE AGENDA FOR THEIR COMMUNITY EFFORTS. DEVELOPING THESE LEADERSHIP SKILLS AND CAPACITIES HAS BEEN SHOWN TO PROTECT AGAINST HIGH RISK BEHAVIORS. AND THIRD EQUITY AND JUSTICE NEED TO BE EMBEDDED INTO THE PROGRAM. AS WITH PROP SIXTY FOURS COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT GRANT PROGRAM THE YOUTH ACCOUNT MUST BE DESIGNED EQUITABLY WITH DEEP INVESTMENTS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN MOST TARGETED BY THE WAR ON DRUGS. A SET OF POLICY DECISIONS DESIGNED TO SYSTEMATICALLY CRIMINALIZE PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. OUR INVESTMENTS TODAY CAN BE AN IMPORTANT STEP IN KNOWLEDGE IN THESE WRONGS AND ENCOUNTERING AND THE PRODUCTION OF HEALTH INEQUITIES THAT HAS STEMMED FROM INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM. OUR DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE WE PUT OUR RESOURCES AND EFFORTS COMMUNICATE TO USE THAT WE VALUE THEIR LEADERSHIP IN DETERMINING WHAT WILL WORK IN THEIR COMMUNITY. THROUGH ROBUST INVESTMENTS AND PREVENTION WE CAN HONOR AND STRENGTHEN THE SKILLS AND CAPACITY OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY WIDE SOLUTION. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] A TACKLER. GOOD AFTERNOON CENTERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH YOU TODAY I ECHO HOST EVERYTHING THAT YOU IT JUST SAID. I HAVE WORKED IN THE ALCOHOL DRUG PREVENTION FIELD SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR I SERVED AS A DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT ALCOHOL DRUG PROGRAMS MANAGING PREVENTION PROGRAMS. I SIT ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNITED STATES ANTI DOPING AGENCY LEADING THEIR EDUCATION COMMITTEE. AND I LEAVE THE CALIFORNIA FRIDAY I PARTNERSHIP AT THE TULARE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. THE CALIFORNIA FRIEND MY PARTNERSHIP IS FUNDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND IT IS A YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM STATEWIDE AND IT'S INCLUDED IN THEIR STRATEGIC PLAN. WE SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND FIFTY OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AT MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED SITES. OUR LOCAL PARTNERS ARE IN THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND IN NONPROFIT AGENCIES. AND IT'S THROUGH THIS INFRASTRUCTURE THERE WERE OR DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH ANDTHE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN ACHIEVING THEIR GOALS. ARE SEEING THE EVOLUTION OF PREVENTION PROGRAMS FROM WELL INTENTIONED SCARE TACTICS TO EVIDENCE BASED YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. AND MY PURPOSE TODAY IS TRYING SHARE SOME PRINCIPLES THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO LOOK AT TO GET GREAT RESULTS. COUNTY PROGRAMS FUNDED BY THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOLLOWS A STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK PROCESS. ASSESSING THE NEEDS AND COMMUNITIES IDENTIFYING STRATEGIES IMPLEMENTING THOSE STRATEGIES AND EVALUATING HOW WELL THEY ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THOSE. AND RESEARCH AROUND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT HAS IDENTIFIED RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS. THAT CONTRIBUTE TO YOUNG PEOPLE GROWING UP TO EITHER STRUGGLE. OR TO THRIVE. AND SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS WILL RELY ON EVIDENCE BASED STRATEGIES RATHER THAN JUST CURRICULUMS. AND HAVE NOT YET MET A YOUNG PERSON WHOSE LIFE HAS BEEN CHANGED BY CURRICULA. IS BEEN CHANGED BY THE PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN ACT WITHIN THOSE PROGRAMS AND THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE CREATE AROUND THEM. THE FRIEND I LIE PROGRAM FOLLOWS A SET OF STANDARDS OF PRACTICE. THINGS THAT ARE EVIDENCE BASED AND TO THOSE STANDARDS ARE SAFE ENVIRONMENT BOTH PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. AND CARING RELATIONSHIPS. AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE WHEN WE HAVE NEW RESOURCES IS THE URGE TO CREATE LOTS OF NEW PROGRAMS. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT WE BUILD UPON THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE OF PROGRAMS. THAT ARE CONTINUOUSLY LOOKING TO IMPROVE. AND INVEST IN THEM TO EXPAND THEIR CAPACITY. WE WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON WAYS TO ENGAGE YOUTH IN POSITIVE WAYS. WHERE THEY BECOME PARTNERS IN THE DESIGN OF THOSE PROGRAMS? AND THAT THEY'RE HELPING CREATE THE SOLUTIONS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE FAIL MOST WHEN WE ATTEMPTED TO APPLY ADULT MODELS TO YOUTH ISSUES. OUR BEST PROGRAMS ARE THOSE PROGRAMS WHERE WE HAVE USED VOICE IN THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION. AND IN THOSE PROGRAMS WE FIND YOUTH THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY ENGAGED. AND HAVE SKILLS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS IN THEIR COMMUNITY. STUDENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE LIKE EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS CREATE A SAFER ENVIRONMENT BY OFFERING SUPPORT WHEN PERFORMANCE SUFFERS. SOON ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS ARE THE INFORM LISTENERS YOUNG PEOPLE NEED. THE SUPPORT FAMILY'S REQUEST AND THE PORTAL AGENCIES REQUIRED TO BE EFFECTIVE. AND THE CONTINUE ON THAT WE LOOK TO CREATE NEEDS A FULL CONTINUE ON FROM YOUTH DEVELOPMENT SERVICES. TO STUDENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WERE WE PROVIDES MORE TREATMENT. I PARTICIPATED IN THE PROP SIXTY FOUR STAKEHOLDER GROUP WHICH IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF COLLABORATION. AND COLLABORATION OFTTIMES IS AN UNNATURAL ACT BETWEEN UNWILLING ENTITIES. BUT YOU HAVE THE CONSENSUS AGREEMENT IN YOUR PACKET. AND I'M HONORED TO SERVE ON THE SERVICES YOUTH ADVISORY GROUP WHERE WE'RE EMBARKING ON A JOURNEY TO PROVIDE INPUT. ON A CONTINUUM OF SERVICES THAT APPROPRIATELY MEET YOUTH NEEDS AND AGAIN MAKING SURE WE DON'T PUT YOUTH INTO ADULT MODELS OF CARE. AND THAT WERE ASSURING THAT WE HAVE YOUTH VOICE IN THOSE PROGRAMS. CALIFORNIANS DECIDED THAT CANNABIS USE FOR THOSE OVER TWENTY ONE IS OKAY. BUT WE'VE ALSO WISELY DECIDED THAT THERE IS A RESOURCE AVAILABLE TO REDUCE THAT HARM BECAUSE INCREASED AVAILABILITY. AND NORMALIZATION WILL CREATE HARPER. AN EXAMPLE THAT NORMALIZATION IS ALREADY HOW WE USE THE TERM CANNABIS. INSTEAD OF MARIJUANA. ANYONE RECEIVING PUBLIC FUNDS TO ADDRESS CANNABIS PROBLEMS SHOULD BE INDEPENDENT OF THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. MEASURING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PREVENTION IS CHALLENGING. SOMETIMES WHAT WE MEASURE DOESN'T MATTER. AND SOMETIMES WHAT MATTERS CAN'T BE MEASURED. ENGAGING YOUNG PEOPLE AND UTILIZING EVIDENCE BASED STRATEGIES ARE BASS PATH TO SUCCESS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SURE WITH YOU TODAY AND WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH MISTER DANIELS WELCOME RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY -- I'M WORKING THE DICTION PROFESSION FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS -- PRIMARILY HAPPEN NEVADA COUNTY PLASTER COUNTY ANIMAL LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDER. AND IN WORKING IN THOSE RURAL COMMUNITIES -- WHAT WE'VE DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS? IS WHAT WE CALL AND THE CAMPUS MODEL AND THE CAMPUS MODEL SUPPORTS A ROBUST COMMUNITY PREVENTION PROGRAM. IN ON CAMPUS WITHDRAWAL MANAGEMENT RESIDENTIAL CARE RECOVERY RESIDENCES. OUTPATIENT SOCIAL SERVICES MEDICAL NAVIGATION SUPPORT AN AFTER CARE LICENSE METAL MEDICAL PROVIDERS LICENSE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. CERTIFIED ISSUE DO YOU CANCERS IN A WIDE RANGE OF SUPPORT STAFF. THE FIRST CAMPUS WAS BUILT IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE UP IN GRASS VALLEY AND FUNDED THROUGH A LOAN. FROM USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT. AN UNLIKELY FUNDING PARTNER. THE CAMPUS PROVIDE SERVICES TO HUNDREDS ON A DAILY BASIS AND SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES OVER ONE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS ANNUALLY. THE KEY ALCOVE OUR CAMPUS MODEL THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED HAS BEEN THE IMPACT ON THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. BY DRIVING CHILD UNIFICATION OF OVER A HUNDRED CHILDREN ANNUALLY. AS WE ALL KNOW 90% OF AMERICANS WOULD THAT SHE DE BEGAN THEIR USE IN THE TEN YEARS. AND NEW WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE WE BELIEVED IT WAS IMPERATIVE TO DEVELOP. PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE. AND WE DEVELOPED A COMMUNITY PREVENTION MODEL WHICH UTILIZES PARTNERSHIPS WITH SCHOOLS PROBATION SOCIAL SERVICES. OTHER CRIMINAL JUSTICE PARTNERS -- AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE -- A FULL COMPLEMENT OF PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT SERVICES TO ADOLESCENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. CURRENTLY PROVIDING SOME ARE CURRENTLY PROVIDING SERVICES OVER TWENTY SCHOOLS IN PLASTER NEVADA COUNTIES. PROVIDING EDUCATION ON ISSUE DO YOU COPING BEHAVIORS AND DRAW IN UTILIZING DRUG TESTING AS A COMPLIANCE TOOL. AND YOU MAY RECOGNIZE IN THE ANNUAL REPORT THAT I SUBMITTED. OUR CAMPUS MODEL ENABLES COMMUNITIES TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE CONSTELLATION OF COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH INDIVIDUALS. AND FAMILIES IMPACTED BY ISSUE DO COST AVOIDANCE SAVINGS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM SOCIAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY SPECTRUMS OF THE COMMUNITY. IN CLOSING I JUST LIKE TO OFFER A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS -- THAT HAVE. YOU KNOW THAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT AND IN MY LAST TWENTY YEARS AND WORKING -- IN THIS PROFESSION. IN THAT. WE HAVE DRUG FREE COMMUNITY COALITIONS OF PERRIN PLASTER COUNTY THAT ARE FUNDED BY OWN DCP. AND THEY CREATE A STEERING COMMITTEE BY TWELVE TWELVE SECTORS IN THE COMMUNITY SOME OF YOU MAY BE AWARE OF THAT. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO OFFER THAT UP S A RECOMMENDATION IF YOU INTEND TO DRIVE THAT DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL OR COUNTY AND MARJORIE -- AND THEN THE SECOND. ONE IS THE FUNDING MECHANISM AND THIS IS GOING BACK AWAY ISMS ON BEAR WITH ME THE FUNDING MECHANISM THAT WE CREATED A PROP THIRTY SIX BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE THAT ALLOCATED FUNDING -- TO TO THE COUNTIES -- WAS IN AGREEMENT WITH EVERYBODY TOOK QUITE AWHILE TO COME UP WITH THAT SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL -- BUT THAT IS A POSITIVE FUNDING MECHANISM TO DRIVE THE FUNDS DOWN TO THE COMMUNE TOWN THE COUNTIES AS WELL -- THE THIRD. THIRD RECOMMENDATION I HAVE IS -- WHEN YOU LOOK TO CREATE NEW FACILITIES BECAUSE WE HAVE NO NOW? LOOK AT THE MODEL THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY DEPARTMENT HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR PROPOSITION. FORTY SIX WHICH CREATED INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT THE STATE FOR HOMELESSNESS. THIS FUNDING MODEL COULD BE EASILY MODEL TO BUILD ALL THE MODALITIES OF FACILITIES NEEDED FOR ADOLESCENT CARE IN CALIFORNIA. AND LASTLY -- INSURE YOU KNOW AS A PROVIDER AND AND AS AN EMPLOYER. ENSURE THAT A LARGE EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AN ISSUE DO YOU PROFESSIONALS. I I THINK I HEARD IT MENTIONED ONCE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOLKS. ESPECIALLY THOSE SPECIALIZING IN ADOLESCENT FAMILY COUNSELING. MARCH PET DETERMINED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THAT THE ISSUE DO YOU WORK FORCE WAS DISTRESSED AND NEEDED TO INCREASE DRAMATICALLY TO MEET THE ADULT NEED. SEVEN YEARS AGO. OUR WORK FORCE REMAINS SERIOUSLY DISTRESSED AND COULD NOT MEET THE NEEDS CITIES ADDITIONAL SERVICES WILL CREATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS -- QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. OKAY YES CENTER LEYVA. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS MISS SIMMS I'D LIKE TO START WITH YOU IF THAT'S OKAY. YOU TALKED ABOUT EQUITY -- WHICH I THINK IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. MY MY QUESTION IS WHAT WOULD YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS BE FOR HOW THE YOUTH EDUCATION ACCOUNT I'M TO SHORTEN THAT A LITTLE BIT SINCE IT'S KIND OF LONG -- CAN ACTUALLY STRIVE FOR RACIAL AND ETHNIC AND SOCIAL ECONOMIC EQUITY HOW COULD WE ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THAT. THANK YOU I'M. SO. INITIALLY I MEAN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT WHERE THAT WHERE THE DOLLARS ARE GOING CELL THINKING ABOUT WHICH COMMUNITIES HAVE BANNED. DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE WAR ON DRUGS ON WILL BE AN IMPORTANT PIECE -- AND DEVELOPING A METHODOLOGY FOR DOING IT WILL BE IMPORTANT -- AND THEN ANOTHER ELEMENT OF IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ABOUT THINKING ABOUT WHO THE MONEY GOES TO AND WHAT IT'S USED FOR SO. I THINK IT'LL BE IMPORTANT TO REALLY LOOK AT HOW WE CAN INCENTIVIZE -- ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE LED BY PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW OUR LEVINE AND A PART OF THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY WORK. ALSO LED BY WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR I THINK WILL BE IMPORTANT AS WELL. AND ADDITIONALLY REALLY LOOKING AT KIND OF A ASSETS BASED APPROACH TO THE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS. I THINK YOU KNOW SERVICES ARE AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF TREATMENT -- AND LOOKING AT INVESTMENTS THAT CAN REALLY INVEST IN COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE VERY PLACES AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT KIDS NEED. TO HAVE ACTIVITIES AND TO BUILD SKILLS -- THOSE WILL BE IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF DESIGNING AN EQUITY FOCUS PROGRAM RATHER THAN ONE THAT'S MORE DOWNSTREAM AND LOOKING AT TREATMENT AFTER THE FACT. THANK YOU THOSE VERY HELPFUL -- DOCTOR COOLER. CAN YOU DESCRIBE YOUR FIVE HARD EVIDENCE BASED DRUG PREVENTION. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION WE FOCUS ON A SET OF STANDARDS OF PRACTICE WHICH ARE. STEEPED IN YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES THE FIRST OF THOSE IS MAKING SURE THAT ANY CONTACT WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. PROVIDES A SAFE ENVIRONMENT BOTH PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. THAT WE ALSO THAT AND TAKE A LOOK AT DOING SKILL BUILDING WITH THEM SO THAT THEY ARE REALLY. NOT JUST PARTICIPATING BUT THEY'RE GAINING SOMETHING BY THEIR PARTICIPATION. WE ALSO THEN TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR CONNECTED TO THEIR COMMUNITY THAT THEY'RE NOT WORKING IN ISOLATION BUT THEY'RE CONNECTING WITH ALL THOSE AROUND THEM. WE ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR BUILDING POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS BOTH WITH THEIR PEERS. AND WITH ADULTS AND THAT THEY'RE INVOLVED IN ADVOCACY SO SOME OF THOSE TYPES OF ADVOCACY WOULD INCLUDE WORKING WITH MERCHANTS LOCALLY SO WORKING WITH ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO MERCHANTS ARE NOW WORKING WITH CANNABIS MERCHANTS AS WELL TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE MERCHANTS ARE RESPONSIBLE AND THEIR BEHAVIORS AND THE COMMUNITY SO LOOKING AT INVESTING WHERE WE'RE GOING TO SEE AN INCREASED AVAILABILITY BECAUSE WHERE THERE'S INCREASED AVAILABILITY. YOU'LL SEE INCREASE PROBLEMS SO THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE STRATEGIES TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE TO INVEST. TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE YOU'RE HAVING MORE SALES AND MORE AVAILABLE PRODUCT. VERY GOOD ONE OTHER QUESTION -- YOU TALK ABOUT AVOID SUBSCRIBING TO THE DRUG OF THE MONTH CLUB -- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT IS EFFECTIVE -- PREVENTION STRATEGY. BACK A REALLY GREAT QUESTION DOT. WE HAVE A CONCERN THAT WHATEVER SEEMS TO BE THE DRUG ABUSE TODAY BECOMES THE FOCUS OF OUR PREVENTION EFFORTS. AND WHAT WE THEN MISS BY DOING SO IS THINKING ABOUT WHY ARE YOUNG PEOPLE NEEDING TO FEEL DIFFERENT ABOUT WHO THEY ARE AND WHERE THEY ARE. SO LOOKING AT MORE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE SUPPORTS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM GETTING TO THE ROOT CAUSES. BECAUSE ALCOHOL IS ALWAYS THERE. IT IS PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE DRUG OF CHOICE. YET WE'LL SEE WHAT WE MAY TERM AS EPIDEMICS ON OTHER DRUGS AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE SO VAPING IS A HUGE ISSUE RIGHT NOW. PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BECOME A BIG ISSUE. BUT WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE DRUGS INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THE UNDERLYING ISSUES AS TO WHY THEY'RE CHOOSING TO DO THAT. SO OUR HOPE IS THAT IN OUR PREVENTION EFFORTS CERTAINLY WE WILL EDUCATE THEM ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEIR BRAINS. THEY KNOW SOME OF THAT WE DON'T KNOW ALL OF THAT THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW THAT BEST OF THE RENTAL CAR COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY WON'T RENT A CAR TO SOMEBODY UNDER. TWENTY FIVE THERE YOU GO. BUT FOR THE REST OF US TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW VULNERABLE THEY ARE BECAUSE IN THEIR MINDS. THERE SUPERMAN SUPERWOMAN NOTHING CAN EVER HAPPEN TO THEM THAT'S RIGHT SO IT'S HELPING THEM AND HELPING THEIR FRIENDS STEP IN SO IT ISN'T JUST AN INDIVIDUAL DECISION. BUT IT'S AN ENVIRONMENTAL SUPPORT SYSTEM AROUND THEM THAT HELPS KEEP THEM SAFE THIS GREAT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT AND I WANTED TO BRING IT UP PUBLICLY BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WE TURN ON THE TV AND IF. YOU WANT TO BE REALLY HAPPY YOU TAKE THIS BILL IF YOU WANT TO BE NOT SO HAPPY YOU TAKE THAT FILL IF YOU'RE FEELING A LITTLE DEPRESSED YOU TAKE THIS PILL. IS A REALLY GETTING TO THE ROOT CAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING SO LIKE YOUR BODY IMAGE WILL. CLOSE ON AND ON AND AND WE'D LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW CAN WE GET TO THOSE CORE. SUPPORTS THE YOUNG PEOPLE NEED TO FEEL CONNECTED IT'S AMAZING THAT E HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COULD BE ON A CAMPUS OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE. AND FEEL ALONE BRIGHT CONNECTED AND IN SOME CASES WE HAVE A REAL ISSUE OF DISEASE OF THE HEART THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED. AGREED TO CONNECTING TO THE COMMUNITY THANK YOU I'VE AND IT'S FOR YOU MISTER DANIELS -- WHAT DO YOU THINK CAN BE THAT FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR YOUR MORE THAN TWO DECADES OF WORK IN THIS FIELD IT'S IT'S HARD TO DO BUT YOU'VE CHANGE LIVES I'M SURE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH? WHAT DO YOU THINK CAN BE DONE TO PROVIDE STEP SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT TO MINORS WHO ARE CHRONICALLY TRUANT FROM SCHOOL OR WHOSE PARENTS ARE JUST NOT ENGAGED? THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND CERTAINLY ONE THAT WE HAVE STRUGGLED WITH FOR YEARS -- AND AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL AND WE HAVE TRIED TO CREATE SETTINGS ON THE CAMPUS WHERE IS OUR STUDENTS CAME -- IN WOULD GET SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE DAY -- HAVE THE ABILITY TO COME TO OUR CAMPUS FOR DIFFERENT SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE DAY BUT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A CONCERTED. PROCESS AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL TO REALLY DRILL DOWN ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE AND AND DEVELOP A STRATEGY FOR BUT I I SEE IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT -- AS WELL AS BEING ABLE -- TO INTEGRATING INTO -- DYSFUNCTIONAL TEENAGERS FAMILY SYSTEMS AS WELL. VERY GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL. NO FURTHER QUESTIONS MISTER CHAIR. RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM OF PAYMENT RIGHT SO I'VE I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS -- FIRST OF ALL IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW IT'S THE END OF YEARS AGO WERE ANTICIPATING YOU POTENTIALLY FUNDS WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE CAN GUESS. HE JUST MAYBE SPEAK. TO ANY CONVERSATIONS YOU'VE HAD -- COALITIONS HAD WITH US STATE AGENCIES IN TERMS OF PREPARATION TO TYPE OF FEEDBACK YOU'VE GUY NO YOU'VE PRESENTED HERE TO US AS WELL -- BUT IN TERMS OF YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH DEPARTMENT TERMS OF THE WHERE THINGS SEEM TO BE GOING IN TERMS OF PREPARATION FOR MAKING EFFECTIVE USE OF THESE FUNDS. THE QUESTIONS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROP SIXTY FOUR STAKEHOLDERS GROUP WAS ONE OF THE PLACES IN WHICH YOU HAD A WIDE ARRAY OF PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER. AND WE DID HAVE REPRESENTATION FROM THE DEPARTMENTS AT THOSE MEETINGS AT TIMES -- THEY CERTAINLY WERE NOT IN A POSITION TO MAKE ANY STATEMENTS OR TAKE ANY POSITIONS. BUT THEIR PRESENCE CERTAINLY DEMONSTRATED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO BE AWARE WHAT WAS GOING ON AND TO HEAR WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH STAKEHOLDERS -- WE CONTINUE FROM OUR RELATIONSHIP AND MANAGING PROJECTS ITH EACH OF THE THREE DEPARTMENTS TRY TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE IS CAPACITY THAT COULD BE EXPANDED. AND WHEN RESOURCES BECOME AVAILABLE HAPPY TO DO SO BUT AGAIN TRYING NOT TO BE CUED UP TO BE AGAIN THE DRUG OF THE MONTH CLUB. BY CUED UP TO WORK ON A WHOLE RANGE OF SERVICES THAT WILL ADDRESS. THE UNDER AGE MARIJUANA USE AS WELL SUBSTANCES AS WELL. AND ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT -- THAT CAME UP IN THE LAST PANEL AGAIN IS THAT -- WE DON'T KNOW HOW WALL TILE THE THE MONEY WILL BE RIGHT ONE HOPES THAT OVER TIME WE HAVE AN EXPECTED AMOUNT BUT IT'S POSSIBLE. THAT YOU COULD SEE VERY A SWINGS BECAUSE THE WAY THE MONEY FLOWS RIGHT PART ONE PART TWO FINALLY DOWN TO THIS ONE SO YOU CATCH WHATEVER'S LEFT RIGHT SO COULD BE A LOT ONE YEAR IT'S POSSIBLE MIGHT DECLINE ANOTHER. MAYBE AND WE DON'T KNOW THIS CAN BE CORRELATED ECONOMY OR NOT HOW MUCH EXACTLY. YOU KNOW HOW LARGE THE BLACK MARKET GETS OR SHRINKS OR SO FORTH. SO. FROM. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE I KNOW YOU SPOKE MORE PRESSURE PROGRAMMATIC LEE BUT HOW DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD HANDLE THIS OUR ADDRESS THIS -- POSSIBILITY OF VERY ABILITY BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE RIGHT WELL YOU IT'S NOT LIKE -- WHAT'S ONE YEAR WE CAN SELL THE RAMP UP THE PROGRAM AND TRAIN A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE AND THEN. DOWNSIZE IT -- BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE NO MONEY OR WELL. SO HOW IT HOW HOW THIS HOW HOW WOULD YOU SEE -- THAT THAT WE HANDLE THIS VOLATILITY AND SOME PEOPLE SAY WELL TO MOVE ALL THE MONEY ON THE STREET RIGHT AWAY RIGHT -- BUT THEN YOU COULD HAVE THESE REALLY BIG SWINGS OR SOME PEOPLE SAY WELL LET'S BUILD UP AT A RESERVE AND SAY THAT WE'RE GONNA SO THAT WE CAN KEEP TO SETTLE LOOKS MORE STEADY LEVEL MAYBE LOWER LEVEL BUT AGAIN WE HAVE TO SORT OF GUESS A LITTLE BIT. SO WITH EVERY SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD HANDLE THE THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS IN RELATION TO THE VOLATILITY OF POTENTIAL VOLATILITY I DON'T KNOW THE SOURCE. ALL THIS THROUGHOUT A COUPLE COMMENTS OUT THERE I THINK THIS NEEDS A HIGH LEVEL STRATEGIC PLAN OKAY -- AND AND EACH ONE OF THOSE -- COMPARTMENTS ENTERED IN A FIRE WITHIN AT STRATEGIC PLAN TIMELINE AND ROLLED OUT. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IF WE TRAIN OF THE WORK FORCE TODAY WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE FACILITIES. TO GET THE FACILITIES WE HAVE A A REGULATORY QUAGMIRE ESPECIALLY WAS RESIDENTIAL -- AND DETOXIFICATION SERVICES -- THAT CURRENTLY IN VERY DIFFICULT FOR PROVIDERS TO NAVIGATE SO WE NEED. TO BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THAT SO MY MY RECOMMENDATION IS A HIGH LEVEL STRATEGIC PLAN THAT TIME LINE. AND THEN WE JUST ROLLED OUT BASED ON THOSE DECISIONS -- WELL I RECOGNIZE YOUR ASKING PARTIALLY KINDA HOW TO YOU KNOW HOW DOES THE PROGRAM OPERATE QUESTION -- AND I THINK OUR HOW YOU THINK YOU SHOULD ARE HOW I THINK IT'S OVER DISCUSS SOMETHING THAT I THINK IT'S RELATED TO THAT WHICH IS -- ONE I MEAN WE STRUGGLE WITH THIS WITH YOU KNOW BEING FOUNDATION FUNDED. OFTEN ALL OF THE TIME AND I KNOW AND THAT KIND OF TOBACCO CONTROL WORLD ALSO REVENUES HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW SLOWLY DECLINING OVER THE YEARS -- ONE THING I'D SAY IS THAT WE REALLY DO A LOT TO FOCUS THE PROGRAMMATIC EFFORTS ON BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY WITHIN COMMUNITIES SO. YOU KNOW I'M NOT JUST. PEOPLE KEEP COMING THROUGH THE DOOR AND WE KEEP NEEDING TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT HOW DO WE DESIGN THE PROGRAM. SO THAT WERE BUILDING LEADERSHIP OVER THE LONG TERM TO ADDRESS THIS AND A HOST OF ISSUES. THAT AFFECT COMMUNITY HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND THEN HOW DO WE BUILD THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAS A LONGER YOU KNOW SHELF LIFE. AND THEN YOU KNOW THAT THE FUNDS FROM YEAR TO YEAR SO I THINK THAT'LL BE AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM ATTIC ELEMENT. AND I WOULD TAKE -- MAYBE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE AND ONE THAT WILL BE HEARD ANYONE ELSE'S I HOPE THERE IS NO MONEY AVAILABLE I HOPE THAT OUR PREVENTION PROGRAMS ARE SO GOOD. THAT THE REVENUES ARE NOT HIGH ENOUGH THAT WE INVEST IN THIS CATEGORY. BEING THAT THAT PROBABLY WILL NOT BE THE CASE. I WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT PROBABLY A TWO TO THREE YEAR LAG TIME. BEFORE YOU SEE ENOUGH REVENUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM. AND I WOULD SUGGEST NOT PUTTING OUT DRIBBLING SMALL AMOUNTS BUT WAITING UNTIL YOU CAN DO SOMETHING CORRECTLY. AND MAKING SURE THAT YOUR INVESTMENT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WHAT WE LIKE TO SEE IS A MOVEMENT RATHER THAN MOMENTS WE CAN PUT A LITTLE BIT SOME MONEY OUT AND CREATE OF BATS? BUT EVENTS WON'T CREATE A MOVEMENT NOR CHANGE SOCIAL NORMS. SO MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IF YOU HAVE ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT DO SMALL PILOT PROJECTS. BUT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE THAT CHOOSE AND AGAIN I HOPE THAT OUR PREVENTION PROGRAMS ARE SO GOOD. THAT WE'LL SEE AN INITIAL BUBBLE AND THEN THAT WAS FINDINGS WILL BE REDUCED. AND I KNOW WE HAVE THE THREE OF YOU HERE WILL PREPARE FOR SOME MORE PEOPLE IN PUBLIC COMMENT BUT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS THERE. WELL IN ANY COALITION -- MAY HAVE THE DESERVE GENERAL AGREEMENT IN TERMS OF DIRECTION ON HOW WE SHOULD BE AS THE WE HAVE THE AGENCIES COMING UP RIGHT AFTER YOU BUT IN TERMS OF VERY STAKEHOLDERS AND STIR SOME IS. THERE HOW MUCH DIVISION -- AGREEMENT IS THERE ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD -- HOW HOW WE SHOULD ADDRESS NOW THIS -- SPENDS MONEY. I THINK YOU'RE STAKEHOLDERS GROUP IS PROBABLY YOUR BEST CONSENSUS DOCUMENTS OKAY THERE ARE MANY AREAS WHERE THERE IS NOT CONSENSUS THE PRIMARY ONE WILL BE HOW MUCH MONEY DO INVEST IN TREATMENT. HOW MUCH MONEY YOU INVEST IN IN PREVENTION? THAT IS A DYNAMIC TENSION THAT SEEMS TO NEVER GO AWAY. YOU'LL NEVER HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO TREAT EVERYONE WHO IS IN NEED-OF TREATMENT AND IF YOU DON'T INVEST ENOUGH IN PREVENTION. YOU'LL KEEP GETTING MORE PEOPLE IN NEED OF TREATMENT FOREVER DEBATING THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT AND WHERE YOU PUT IT BUT PERHAPS WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT MECHANISM TO HAVE THAT KIND OF DISCUSSION YES THAT WOULD BE GREAT. YES YOU THERE HAS ALSO BEEN -- BUT ED CONSENSUS DOCUMENT PUT TOGETHER BY A GROUP OF ORGANIZATIONS LOOKING AT TRAUMA INFORMED APPROACHES AND I'M BLANKING ON THE NAME OF THAT IT'S A LONG ACRONYM BUT I'M SURE THOSE SOME OF THOSE WHO WILL BE -- PROVIDING COMMENT MAY KNOW THE NAME OF IT -- AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT PIECE TO LOOK AT AS WELL BECAUSE IT KIND OF TALK THROUGH THE DIFFERENT -- APPROACHES THAT COULD BE TAKEN AND THE WAY THEY CAN BE REALLY -- A TAILORED IN A WAY TO BE TRAUMA INFORMED. AND THEN FINALLY -- BECAUSE WE ARE HAVING THE AGENCY'S COME UP AFTER YOU AND WE DID THAT. INTENTIONALLY BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT -- THEY HEARD WHAT YOU SAID AND ALSO PERHAPS RESPONDED -- WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS DO YOU THINK THAT I SHOULD? WE SHOULD BE ASKING THEM OR QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THAT WE WOULD THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE AGENCIES -- CENTER PAN OWN. YOU KNOW. FROM A PROVIDER'S PERSPECTIVE THE REGULATORY PROCESS OF LICENSING -- IS EXTREMELY CHALLENGING AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE EXTREMELY CHALLENGING FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK THROUGH AS WELL. THE CAMPUS THAT I TALK TO YOU ABOUT -- JUST IN OUR OUTPATIENT PROGRAM SERVICES TO THE THE FULL BREADTH OF THE COMMUNITY -- OR LICENSED AND CERTIFIED FOR MENTAL HEALTH OR LICENSED AND CERTIFIED FOR ISSUE DE WERE LICENSED AND CERTIFIED IN FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT AREAS. ALL TO DRIVE SERVICES AT A ONE AREAS SO COLLECTIVELY HOW DO WE MAKE TO REGULATORY PROCESS EASIER FOR PROVIDERS TO APPLY AND IT HERE [inaudible] TO I'M. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND PREVENTION -- WE NOTICES THAT -- FUNDING STREAMS OFTEN GET SILO TO YOU KNOW TO DEALWITH PARTICULAR DISEASE STATE SEN YOU KNOW THIS -- ONE I THINK WE REALLY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF VERSUS TO THAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND I KNOW THERE IS. YOU BASED ON THE PROPOSITION LANGUAGE OF FOCUS ON SUBSTANCE USE AND AND YOUTH I THINK THAT LEAVES A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY -- TO REALLY TAKE LESSONS FROM OTHER SILENT PROGRAMS AND DESIGN IT IN A WAY THAT -- ALLOWS FOR FLEXIBILITY AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL AND I'D LIKE TECH KIND OF HERE YOU KNOW HERE FROM THE DEPARTMENTS ABOUT HOW THAT WILL BE APPROACHED I THINK THAT'LL BE A CRITICAL PIECE. I THINK ITS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FROM SILOS TO SYNERGY -- WE SEE GREAT PROGRAMS IN EACH OF THE THREE DEPARTMENTS AND IT'S THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THEM THAT ARE SOMETIMES DIFFICULT. YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T SEE THE DIFFERENCES AND WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM. ALL THEY SEE IS WHAT KIND OF SERVICES AVAILABLE WHAT KIND OF SUPPORTS CAN I BE A PART OUT. SO IT'S GETTING THOSE. GUERRILLAS IN THE LIVING ROOM TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE ACTUALLY WORK TOGETHER IT'S NOT EASY. THEIR HUGE SYSTEMS AND EACH HAS CREATED WONDERFUL WAYS TO DISSEMINATE RESOURCES THROUGH THEIR INDIVIDUAL SILO AND THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THEM. ARE ALWAYS CHALLENGING. THIS CREATES AT OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON THE GOOD PRO AS AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONNECT THEM BETTER. THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY. ARE BETTER AT DOING THAT THAN THOSE AT THE HIGHER LEVELS. SO LOOK TO COMMUNITIES AND ASK THEM HOW DO WE LINK THOSE TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY DOING. RIGHT THANK YOU -- AT THAT THEN THE FAN AND OUT. SO -- AGAIN THANK YOU ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID BECAUSE AND IS THAT -- THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ME WE HAVE A FUND THAT WE OFTEN HEAR WHO WE HAVE FUNDS PARTS DOWN SILOS RIGHT MAY HAVE FEDERAL MONEY TO HAVE TO GO CERTAIN PLACES AT CETERA. WE ALSO SENATE'S HAVE FUNDS DIVIDED UP SO VERTICALLY HORIZONTALLY VERTICAL SILOS WILL THIS IS HEALTH CARE MY DISSERTATION THIS IS YOU KNOW SUBSTANCE USE. THAT. MENTAL HEALTH WHATEVER AND THEN THEY HAVE TO AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE A SLICE HORIZONTALLY EIGHT STATE FEDERAL MONEY STATE HAS TO GO TO COUNTY YOU KNOW SCHOOL DISTRICT WHATEVER. AND WHILE CERTAINLY THERE'S A REASON WE HAVE THINGS ORGAN THAT IS THE FIGURE OUT WHAT'S MOST AFFECTED SO I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU BROUGHT UP SO. A SENATOR ALSO. I JUST WANT -- TO SAM REALLY GLAD TO HEAR I KNOW YOU ALL MENTIONED SOME VERSION OF THIS BUT DOCTOR COOLEY USE PACIFIC LEE TALKED-ABOUT. BUILDING UPON EXISTING PROGRAMS AND EXPANDING CAPACITY I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT WAY TO GO AND TO BE THAT KIND OF LIKE. OF WILL REFER TO IS NOT JUST THE SERVICES BUT WHAT DO YOU BUILDING AS FAR AS ORGANIZATION WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY -- BECAUSE SERVICES CAN COME AND GO THEY COULD CHANGE BUT WHAT STAYS THERE WHAT DO YOU CREATE THAT PERMANENT. THAT THAT COMMUNITY CAN RELY ON AND THAT WE EMPOWER THEM. NOT JUST YOU KNOW BE THE SAVIOURS WALK IN AND WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS AND THAT AND WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT ALL FOR YOU. AND IT IS MUCH HARDER TO BUILD. SOME REAL ORGANIZATION BUILD THIS REAL CONNECTED INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE EVERYBODY'S COMMITTED. NOT YOU KNOW OKAY WHERE THE DOLLARS COME FROM WHO'S GOING TO GET THE DOLLARS WILL I WANT THE DOLLARS A RATHER -- EVERYBODY HAS THEIR PLACE IT'S OKAY TO BE. I WILL USE THE WORD SILO AGAIN BUT IT'S OAK IT'S OKAY TO HAVE YOUR EXPERTISE OR A PARTICULAR PLACE THAT YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON BUT IT HAS. TO COME ALL CONNECTED BUT I DID WAS SAY APPRECIATE THAT POINT OF VIEW AND IT REMINDS ME -- THAT WE HAVE TO DESIGN AND CRAFT SOME OF THESE IDEAS THANK YOU MUCH LIKE A PUZZLE YOU HAVE NEED ALL THE PIECES TO GET THE WHOLE PICTURE. ANY OTHER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY WELL THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS -- REALLY APPRECIATED I WOULD JUST MAKE NOTE TO OUT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT TO BE A SIGN UP SHEET SO WE'LL BE DOING THAT AFTER NEXT PANEL. SO JUST -- BUT SERGEANTS SO PLEASE SIGN UP IF YOU WISH TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT I KNOW WHEN IT WILL COME UP. OUR OUR DEPARTMENT DIRECTORS WHO WERE INVITED TO A FAULT IN IMPLEMENTATION -- DIRECTOR JENNIFER KENT'S OF THE PART HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- DOCTOR KAREN SMITH WHO'S OUR STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER AND DIRECTOR OF THE PART PUBLIC HEALTH. AND I CAME JACKSON DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF THE PART EDUCATION WELCOME. AND APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU BEING HERE AND TO SHARE AND TO SHARE WITH US -- WHAT WORK HAS TAKEN PLACE SO FAR WHAT DO -- TO MAKE EFFECTIVE USE OF THESE FUNDS WHICH WERE HOPING BASED ON WHAT FINANCE TOLD US WE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP PEOPLE OUT WITH. SO WITH THAT -- AND IF YOU HAVE AN OREO AGO AND OKAY WILL GO HEAD START WITH THE PARTS OF THE HEALTHCARE SPACE YEAH WELCOME THANK YOU SO MUCH -- THANK YOU SENATORS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE'VE DONE TO DATE -- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- CITY PH. HAS THAT WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO DROPS THE THERE WAS AN INITIAL FIVE MILLION DOLLAR CARVE OUT A PROPOSITION. SIXTY FOUR FOR IT WITH ONE TIME FUNDING TO ESTABLISH AN INFANT IMPLEMENTED A PUBLIC INFORMATION -- CAMPAIGN AND IT OUTLINED VERY SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED IN THAT CAMPAIGN WE INTRODUCED TO THE I A WITH DH CS FOR FOUR MILLION DOLLARS -- TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFICS IN PROP SIXTY FOUR PROVIDING BASIC PROVISIONS OF THE LAW AND THE ASSOCIATED PENALTIES. SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR RESTRICTING YOUTH ACCESS TO CANNABIS AND THE POTENTIAL HARMS OF USING CANNABIS TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS INCLUDING BREAK PREGNANT AND BREASTFEEDING WOMEN AND YOUTH -- WE DEVELOPED FOR SCIENCE BE SUBPOPULATION CAMPAIGNS ONE FOR ADULTS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC ONE FOR PREGNANT BREAST FEEDING WOMEN AND ONE FOR YOUTH AND ON ADDITIONAL ONE FOR PARENTS AND MENTORS OF YOUTH. AND WE LAUNCH -- WHAT WE TERMED THE LET'S TALK CANNABIS CAMPAIGN ON TIME ON SEPTEMBER FIRST? TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE GOAL OVER ALL WAS SEN UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF CANNABIS LEGALIZATION. WITH SPECIFIC GOALS FOR EACH OF THE SUB POPULATIONS FOR THE OVER TWENTY ONE THE GOAL WAS TO PROVIDE THEM WITH -- SCIENTIFIC CAN'T BASED INFORMATION THAT THEY COULD USE IN DECIDING FOR THEMSELVES HOW TO RESPONSIBLY USE OR NOT USE CANNABIS. FOR PREGNANT BREAST FEEDING WOMEN AND FOR YOUTH BOTH THE GOAL REALLY WAS TO DELAY OR PREVENT CANNABIS USE. AND OR OVER USE IN BECAUSE BOTH OF THOSE POPULATIONS HAVE SPECIAL RISK FACTORS WITHOUT FOR PARENTS AND MENTORS IT WAS TO GIVE THEM THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR WHAT THE YOUTH WITH WHOM THEY WORK AND OR LIVE ARE. AT RISK FOR AND HOW TO TALK ABOUT IT. SO -- IN TO A WE DID A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF FORMATIVE RESEARCH PRIOR TO DOING THIS SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE LAY OF THE LAND AS FAR AS BELIEFS AND ATTITUDES AND WHAT INFORMATION WAS ACTUALLY OUT THERE -- FOR EACH OF THESE POPULATION GROUPS AND WE DEVELOPED THAN VERY SPECIFIC AND CULTURALLY CONGRUENT HEALTH COMMUNICATIONS FOR THE EACH OF THOSE CAMP OUT EACH OF THOSE ASPECTS OF THE CAMPAIGN -- WE INCLUDED -- SO WHAT IT ENDED UP WHAT WE ENDED UP DEVELOPING IS OF A ROBUST WEBSITE -- AND THEN FOR EACH SUB POPULATION OF THIRTY SECONDS -- PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS AND CUSTOM JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IN A MINUTE. SOCIAL MEDIA ASSETS TIP SHEETS AND DATA FAQS -- FACT SHEETS ALL OF WHICH ARE IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH -- TO SUPPORT IN BILL THAN THE CAPACITY OF OUR PARTNERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE IS A FAIRLY SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY IN A VERY LARGE STATE AND EACH. PART OF THE STATE HAS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MAKE UP AS FAR AS THOSE GROUPS THAT ARE VULNERABLE WE DEVELOPED -- A SET OF LET'S TALK CANNABIS CAMPAIGN MATERIALS WERE FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT PEOPLE COULD DEVELOP THINGS THAT ACTUALLY ADDRESSED THEIR PRIORITIES IN WAYS THAT THEIR COMMUNITY WOULD COULD RELATE. TO THOSE MATERIALS REMAIN AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. WE HAD MONTHLY CALLS WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS AS WELL TO TALK ABOUT UPDATES ON THE CAMPAIGN BUT ALSO. WHAT WE WERE FINDING FOR RESEARCH AND IS NEWS RESEARCH -- DEVELOPED AND TO ANSWER ANY OF THEIR QUESTIONS WE WERE WE WERE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH HOW WELL RECEIVED. THE THE CAMPAIGN WAS IN THE WAY THAT IT HELPED DISSEMINATE SORT OF CONSISTENT MESSAGING ACROSS THE STATE -- AND THEN FINALLY WE CONDUCTED DIGITAL AND TRADITIONAL MEDIA -- PLACEMENT OF FOR ALL OF OUR PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS AM HAD A YOU TUBE CHANNEL DEVELOPED AND ALSO THROUGH ONE OF HIS YOUNG. OVERALL WE HAD A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FIVE FIFTY MILLION IMPRESSIONS GARNERED OVER TWENTY FOUR MILLION VIDEO COMPLETIONS AND OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY TV SPOTS -- AND WHICH WERE BROADCAST ON INTERVIEWS YOU DIEGO AND SO WE FEEL LIKE WE REALLY HAVE MADE A GOOD START ON THE INFORMATION CAMPAIGN -- USING THE MATERIAL THE THE FUNDING THAT WAS AVAILABLE FROM THE BEGINNING. KAMALA TURN IT OVER TO JENNIFER. THIS POINT. THANK YOU DOCTOR CAN. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH -- SO I WANTED -- TO BOTH HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED IN THE AGENDA PREPARED BY YOUR STAFF -- JUST TO SUPPLEMENT IN ADDITION TO THE WORK THAT WE AS A DEPARTMENT HAVE TO AND IN THE DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM -- THE CREATION OF THAT THE WORK WITH THE COUNTY SO -- TO CREATE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE -- FOR THOSE THAT ARE NOT QUITE AS FAMILIAR ON IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM -- WITH OUR TWENTY FIFTEEN MEDICAID IT WAS THE RE AUTHORIZATION OF A SYSTEM OF CARE THAT HAD NEVER EXISTED IN ANY OTHER STATE MEDICAID PROGRAM SO WE WERE THE FIRST IN THE COUNTRY TO CREATE. A TRUE -- CONTINUUM OF CARE ACROSS ALL THE DIFFERENT LEVELS FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER BROADLY RIGHT FROM MEDICAID POPULATION AND SO FOR THE FIRST TIME. WE WERE ABLE TO OFFER PEOPLE ALL THE WAY UP FROM VOLUNTARY INPATIENT DETOX SERVICES DOWN TO RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT. OUTPATIENT INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT MEDICAID ASSISTED TREATMENT. SO GREEN -- SERVICES AND I THINK YOU KNOW THE THE RIGHT IT CERTAINLY -- ACKNOWLEDGES THE WORK INFRASTRUCTURE AND KIND OF ONGOING FUNDING COMMITMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE WITH THE COUNTIES ON THAT -- WE HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME RECIPIENT FOR THE SAFTEY BLOCK GRANT SO THIS IS THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT BLOCK GRANT THAT COMES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE SEND THOSE MONIES DOWN TO THE COUNTIES THEY USE THOSE 80% -- CAN BE USED FOR SERVICES 20% CAN BE USE FOR PREVENTION -- WE HAVE SLIGHTLY CHANGE HOW -- THOSE FUNDS ARE BOTH DISTRIBUTED AND SO INSTEAD OF JUST THE MONEY INSANE TELL US WHAT YOU DID WITH IT WE'RE NOW DOING IT WE HAVE SWITCHED IT SUCH THAT IT'S AN INVOICING TYPE OF THING WHICH IS TELL US WHAT YOU DID WITH THE MONEY AND THEN WE WILL PAY. YOU WANNA INVOICE AS OPPOSED TO A DIRECT -- FUND -- THE THING I REALLY WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT AND I THINK THIS REALLY DEMONSTRATE SOME OF THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE'VE CREATED AND ADDRESSES THE DRUG OF CHOICE COMMENTS -- ON THE PRIOR PANEL IS WE HAVE RECEIVED -- TWO SETS OF SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL FUNDS -- RELATED TO OPIOIDS SO THE CARERS ACT PROVIDED US WITH NINETY MILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO YEARS AND THEN THE OPIOID TARGETED RESPONSE GRANT -- IS ABOUT A HUNDRED IN. FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO YEARS AND THAT IS REALLY FOR STATES TO USE AND A VARIETY OF WAYS TO HELP ADDRESS THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. BUT I THINK YOU KNOW GETTING BACK AND STEP IN A LITTLE BIT AWAY FROM THAT WE HAVE TRIED VERY HARD -- TO WORK ACROSS DIFFERENT -- DEPARTMENTS AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY ORGANISER WE BUILD NOT ONLY IN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR WHICH THE FEDERAL GRANTS ARE DIRECTLY SUPPOSED TO BE USED FOR RIGHT BECAUSE THE GRANT SAY YOU HAVE TO USE THIS FOR OPIOID WORK. BUT WE'VE TAKEN KIND OF A LONGER RANGE PERSPECTIVE WHICH IS ARE WE ABLE TO HELP BUILD CAPACITY AND OTHER AREAS AND SO. I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE U. STUFF -- WHEN YOU TAKE ALL THOSE MONIES? WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS -- ACROSS THE SCOPE OF BOTH OF THOSE FEDERAL GRANTS -- RANGING FROM NALOXONE DISTRIBUTION SO OBVIOUSLY A HUGE AMOUNT OF THAT IS JUST GETTING -- NALOXONE INTO THE HANDS OF LIBRARIES IN JAILS AND FIRST RESPONDERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT -- BUT WE ALSO HAVE FUNDED -- DRUG AND ALCOHOL COUNSELLORS IN RURAL EMERGENCY ROOMS WE HAVE FUNDED -- HOSPITALS MORE BROADLY -- FOR SERVICES IN THE ER SUCH THAT WHEN PEOPLE COME AND THERE'S AN ABILITY TO KIND OF WORK WITH THEM ON A IMMEDIATE BASIS AND PRESCRIBE -- MEDIC LIKELY DONE SOME TARGETED -- WORK WITH THE TRIBAL POPULATIONS BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE EITHER OPIOID MISUSE OR OVERDOSE RATES ARE TRIBAL POPULATIONS ARE. TWO TO THREE FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN THE REST -- WE HAVE PROJECTS FOR OR NEONATAL ABSTINENCE SYNDROME AND WE HAVE DESIGNED SOME PEER SUPPORT PROGRAMS FOR AT RISK YOUTH -- AND THEN APPEAR SUPPORT ARE YOU SPACE RECOVERY SERVICE -- TYPES OF PROJECTS I THINK BROADLY ARE BOTH GOAL WITH THIS FUNDING AS WELL AS OUR INTENTION AND WORKING WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS IS TO NOT JUST ADDRESS THE CURRENT ISSUE AROUND OPIOIDS. BUT ALSO BUILD CAPACITY SO THAT IT IS FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS -- MORE BROADLY. I THINK WHEN YOU THEN -- STEP INTO THE PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR FUNDING AND THIS OPPORTUNITY -- FOR A SPECIFIC SET OF FUNDING COMING FROM A DIFFERENT FUND SOURCE THAT IS REALLY -- ALMOST -- UNLIMITED IN ITS POTENTIAL -- IT HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS IN WHICH THE INITIATIVE SAYS YOU COULD FIND THIS BUT IT ALSO IS PROGRESSIVE RIGHT YOU MADE DO THESE FUNDING. OPPORTUNITIES BUT YOU COULD ALSO DO OTHER THINGS AND I THINK WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS MORE BROADLY IS HOW DO WE BOTH WORK TOGETHER BUT WAY THAT WE ARE TARGETING USE AND FOCUSING MOST EFFECTIVELY ON PREVENTION THERE'S NOT AS MUCH FUNDING. AND PREVENTION EVER RIGHT I'M A I'M A BIG PROGRAM THAT DOES A LOT OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM TYPES OF EXPENDITURES BUT I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF PREVENTION DOLLARS IN MEDICAID AND SO I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS FROM A MORE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH BUT ALSO VERY MUCH DRAWING. ON THE PREVENTION EDUCATION EARLY INTERVENTION SIDE OF THE FUND AND SO I THINK YOU TO THE EXTENT THAT FINANCE -- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY INDICATED THIS IS A GOING TO BE A MAY BUDGET PROPOSAL SOME OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WILL CERTAINLY KIND OF BE GEARED IN THAT AREA WHICH IS HOW DO WE DO SOMETHING. TO CERTAINLY -- CAPTURE -- CHILDREN WHERE THEY ARE -- SO THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THE EDUCATION -- INTERAGENCY ALIGNMENT COMES IN AS WELL AS IN OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH PUBLIC HEALTH SO. HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS AFTER THAT. THANK YOU SUPERINTENDENT DANIELS. GOOD AFTERNOON LADIES AND GENTLEMEN MY NAME IS KIND JACKSON DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF IT -- EDUCATION ON BEHALF OF ST -- PUBLIC SUPERINTENDENT A TONY THURMOND I'M HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUE AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS STEPHANIE PAPPAS. AND I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED SO FAR ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROP PROPOSITION. SIXTY FOUR AND OF FOR SO I'LL DISCUSS THE LAN SOME OF THE SENTIMENTS OF OUR AGENCY PARTNERS HERE -- ONE OF THE LENS AS WE APPROACH THIS IS THROUGH THE WHOLE SCHOOL WHOLE COMMUNITY WHOLE CHILD APPROACH TO INCLUDE A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM STRATEGY. AND THE MAINTENANCE OF APPROPRIATE AND ADEQUATE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS WE ALSO LOOK AT THIS THROUGH THE LENS OF PRIORITIZING THE CONCEPT OF PREVENTION WELLNESS AND EARLY INTERVENTIONS IN SCHOOLS. AND SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES WE HAVE THE INTENT OF COLLABORATION OF COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES AND DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WE ALSO HAVE LOOKING AT THIS THROUGH THE LENS OF DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF TEARS SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT WHICH ALL WHICH INCLUDE ALL LEVELS OF PREVENTION. AND EARLY INTERVENTIONS. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION STARTED WORKING ON THIS ACTUALLY BEFORE JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO THAT WE WERE PREPARED AND POSTURE TO SUPPORT SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS. SHOULD THEY SHOULD ANYTHING ARISE IN TERMS OF CONCERNS FROM PARENTS. OF FOR THE IMPENDING ADULT USE OF RECREATIONAL CANNABIS AND WHEN IT BECAME LEGAL. THE FIRST STEP TO INITIATE IT WILL WEB PAGES WHICH CONTAIN LINKS FROM THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY KIDS SURVEY. YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR STUDIES WHICH REPORTED USAGE RATES LINKS WITH RESEARCH VALIDATED PREVENTION MATERIALS AND RESOURCES FOR PARENTS AND SCHOOL PERSONNEL ONE SUCH RESOURCE WAS A LINK. WITH MORE INFORMATION ABOUT STUDENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WHICH ARE DESIGNED. TO INTERVENE WITH STUDENTS WHO ARE DISPLAY CONCERNING BEHAVIORS. ANOTHER THING THAT WE DID IN THE DEPARTMENT WAS CONVENE AN INTERNAL DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION STAKEHOLDER WORK GROUP CONSISTING OF LEADERS CONSULTANTS AND ANALYSTS FROM PROGRAM AREAS WHICH WE THOUGHT ARE LIKELY TO BE RECIPIENTS OF PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR REVENUE. INCLUDED BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION FOR HEALTH RELATED CAREERS AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND PARENTING% EDUCATION AND SUPPORT AND EARLY LITERACY DROP OUT PREVENTION. STUDENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTHNEEDS SCHOOL SAFETY IN BOWLING PREVENTION. AND ADDITIONALLY SCHOOL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. INCLUDING COUNSELORS NURSES AND LIBRARIANS MISSION IS SPEAKING WITH OTHER STATES DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION SUCH AS COLORADO AND WASHINGTON FOR THE PAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT IN OUR STAFF HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN AN EXTERNAL PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR STEAK OR STAKEHOLDER ROGUE GROUPS WHICH YOU'VE HEARD. SOME OF OUR PARTNERS MENTION BEFORE. AND PART OF THOSE MEMBERS ARE CALIFORNIA FIRST FIVE STEINBERG INSTITUTE CHILDREN'S INSTITUTE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND MANY MANY MORE. THIS GROUP HAS WORKED DILIGENTLY TO CREATE A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE ISSUED THIS PAST FALL TO LAWMAKERS ON HOW TO BEST IMPLEMENT PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR FUNDS. THE CITY HAS VAST EXPERIENCE IN AREAS OF PREVENTION. AN INTERVENTION STUDENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE BEEN MENTIONED HERE TODAY. AND WERE MENTIONED IN THE PROPOSITION. AND THE CITY HAS BEEN A PROPONENT OF STUDENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WHICH ARE AN EFFECTIVE PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION STRATEGY NOT ONLY FOR DRUG AND ALCOHOL USE. BUT ALSO -- USE WITH STUDENTS WHO ARE DISPLAYING -- BEHAVIORS OF CONCERN. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S TOBACCO USE PREVENTION EDUCATION PROGRAM PROVIDES A MODEL OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION PROGRAMS. THIS PROGRAM FOCUSES ITS EFFORTS ON REDUCING RATES OF TOBACCO OR NICOTINE USE AND THE USE OF VAPING DEVICES WHICH WE'VE HEARD TODAY IS REALLY IMPORTANT. ONLINE CANNABIS IS CURRENTLY NOT A TOBACCO PROGRAM FOCUS BUT THE PROGRAM HAS ACHIEVED SUCCESS IN CITIES SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING SMOKING. SMOKING AND NICOTINE USE AMONG -- SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITHIN FUNDING. SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THESE FUNDS TARGET HIGH RISK USE PROVIDE PEER TO PEER MENTOR SHIP PROGRAMS PROVIDE THE USE OF RESEARCH VALIDATED. PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE THE TOOLS NEEDED TO BUILD POSITIVE SCHOOL CLIMATES. THE CITY UNDERSTANDS THAT A KEY COMPONENT OF FUNDING ALLOCATION IS DETERMINING WHETHER THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE FUNDS ARE BEING EFFECTIVE. CURRENTLY WE HAVE FOR ONGOING STUDIES WITH STATE UNIVERSITIES AND RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS TO CONFIRM PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS. THE GRANTEES ARE CLOSELY MONITORED MUCH ANNUALLY EVALUATE THEIR PREVENTION PROGRAMS IN SUBMIT STATUS REPORTS TO DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THROUGH OUR CURRENT WORK ON TOBACCO PREVENTION AND OUR PREVIOUS WORK ON DRUG ALCOHOL PREVENTION. WE'VE LEARNED THAT PREVENTION EDUCATION ABOUT PARTICULAR DRUGS IS IMPORTANT. THE KEY PART OF PREVENTION EDUCATION IS AN EMPHASIS ON REFUSAL SKILLS. DECISION MAKING SKILLS AND PERCEPTION OF ARM. SWING CLOSING I SHARE THESE DE THESE DETAILED INFORMATION WITH YOU ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF OUR TOBACCO PREVENTION PROGRAMS. AND THE WORKS WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED SO FAR TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE ARE DEDICATED TO USING PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR FUNDS EFFECTIVELY. PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR PROVIDES A CRITICAL NEW REVENUE STREAM FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO USING THESE FUNDS TO EDUCATE YOUTH. AND FAMILIES ABOUT THE CONCERNS OF UNDER AGE AND NON MEDICAL USE OF CANNABIS WHILE REDUCING THE STIGMA. OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES TREATMENT AND RECOVERY THANK YOU. SO MUCH THE BURDEN JACKSON START OKAY -- ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- YES CENTER LEYVA [inaudible] THANK YOU. YOU ARE VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE -- I WANT TO START WITH YOU MS CAN'T -- THE ADULT USE MARIJUANA ACT PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AS WE ALL KNOW. RUMOR HAS IT THAT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND SERVICES. HAS NOT TEEN ANY FORMAL CONTACT WITH THE P. AGENCY D. E. TO DEVELOP AN INTER AGENCY AGREEMENT -- AS IS REQUIRED SO IS THAT TRUE AND IF SO WHY. SURE SO I THINK -- WHEN THE ACT WAS PASSED -- AND WE WERE AWARE THAT THERE WERE NOT FUNDS BEING MADE IT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE I THINK THAT WE WE'RE DOING YOU KNOW OTHER. ACTIVITIES RIGHT WE'VE BEEN DOING A TON OF STUFF ON OPIOIDS AND I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE AND WE DID AN INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT FOR THE FIRST FIVE MILLION. SO THERE WAS SOME CONTACT BOTH WITH DPH NOT NECESSARILY SEE EITHER BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T FUNDS AVAILABLE I THINK THAT. WE DO INTER AGENCY AGREEMENTS WITH EACH OTHER AND A VARIETY OF WAYS AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT MAY PROPOSAL -- PART AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET KIND OF OUTLINES. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW THE GOVERNOR WOULD I SEE THOSE FUNDS BEING SPENT WE WOULD BE WORKING ON INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS A KIND OF CONFORM WITH THAT. OVERALL. DESIGN SO I THINK IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE WERE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET AHEAD OF EITHER THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION IN WHICH DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE SPENT BECAUSE THEY SENT. SIMPLY WEREN'T AVAILABLE AND NOW THAT WE'RE STILL AITING FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF WHAT THOSE FUNDS WILL LOOK LIKE THEN WE WOULD WORK ON INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS TO KIND OF CONFORM WITH THAT PROPOSAL. YES GOOD -- I WANT TO ADD TO THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER AND COORDINATING VERY CLOSELY OUR ACTIVITIES IN TERMS OF BUILDING -- BOTH PREVENTION AND TREATMENT USE IT UNDER USING LEVERAGING QUITE FRANKLY THE OPIATE MANY SIT BUT BUT ALSO. ACTUALLY ACTIVELY SITTING DOWN AT A TABLE AND SAYING SORT OF WHERE IS YOUR EXPERTISE WHERE IS OUR EXPERTISE. TO DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE ARE GETTING SILOS MANY WERE ACTUALLY CROSSING OVER AND AND SORT OF COURSE TRADING WHILE YOU'RE REALLY MUCH BETTER IF YOU KNOW DETAILING WITH PHYSICIANS WERE MUCH BETTER IT BUILDING. DATA SYSTEMS AN EVALUATION OR EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS AND SO LITERALLY -- ON AS THESE FINE AND WE'RE JUST FEDERAL AGENCIES WITH DIFFERENT SPECIFICS WERE ACTUALLY CREATING A VERY INTEGRATED. SYSTEM THAT. IS FOCUSED ON EXACTLY THE SAME THING IT'S NOT THE DRUG OF CHOICE WE'RE NOT BUILDING EXCLUSIVELY CERTAIN ASPECTS ARE NALOXONE FOR EXAMPLE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A ROLE. EXCEPT THAT IT'S BUILDINGFOR US A NETWORK OF PARTNERS WITHIN HEALTHCARE FACILITIES WHO WILL BE WORKING WITH US AROUND REPORTING CANNABIS YOU KNOW NEGATIVE OUTCOMES FROM CANNABIS IT CETERA AND SO. I THINK THAT WHILE WE DIDN'T HAVEN'T BEEN DEVELOPING SPECIFIC -- I. A.'S WE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN LEARNING HOW TO WORK TOGETHER AND HAVE REALLY GOOD MODELS NOW ON HOW WE FIGURE OUT. YOU GUYS DO SCHOOLS REALLY WELL YOU DO HEALTHCARE FACILITIES WE DO WE SUPPORT COALITIONS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT WHICH ARE CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON OPIATES BUT WON'T ALWAYS BE. AND GETTING THOSE COSS SECTOR PARTNERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AS CAN BE CRITICAL TO US GETTING ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD TRACTION. IN PREVENTING CANNABIS OVER USE IN YOUTH FRANKLY. THANK YOU FOR THAT SO WHAT. ARE YOU READY TO HIT THE GROUND RUNNING I MEAN I I GUESS MY WORRY IS THAT THAT PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THERE'S BEEN TWO YEARS -- YOU'RE RIGHT EVERYBODY HAS THEIR EXPERTISE BUT ARE YOU GUYS READY ONCE NOW THE FUNDING IS COMING DO YOU HAVE A PLAN HEAVY SET PRIORITIES. HAVE YOU IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES -- TO HAVE NEAR AND LONG TERM GOALS MY MY CONCERN IS THAT THE THESE THINGS HAPPEN AND THERE'S AN EXPECTATION. THAT WHEN WE'RE DOING OUR JOB YOU GUYS ARE KIND SOMETIMES WE FIND OUT THAT'S NOT TRUE. RIGHT AND I THINK -- AGAIN JUST YOU KNOW TO BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES OVERALL STATEMENT IN TERMS OF TO THE EXTENT THAT FUNDS ARE BEING APPROPRIATED IN THIS BUCKET -- THREE SOME OF THE PART OF THE NAY REVISION WILL KIND OF SHOW YOU SOME OF THE WORK AND THINKING AND GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THAT WE OURSELVES HAVE THOUGHT OF AS AND THAT WILL BE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IN MAY AND SO I CAN YOU SHARE THAT WITH US. COULD NOT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT IS THE IT IS THE PART OF THE GOVERNOR AND TERMINATE HISMAY PROPOSAL BUT I THINK THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD. PROPOSE AND SAY HERE'S THE TIME FRAME FOR THE EXPENDITURE OF THOSE FUNDS HERE'S WHAT THOSE FUNDS WOULD BE IN A PROPOSED TO BE. PORTION OUT OF YOU KNOW IN CERTAIN WAYS AND THESE ARE THE WAYS THAT WE WOULD BE WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO HELP DEVELOP EITHER -- THE EXPENDITURE OR THAT PROCESS AND SO I THINK ALL OF THAT IS STILL -- UNDER THE DEVELOPMENT -- BETWEEN US THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION BUT IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL IN MAY. SO WE CAN SHARE THAT WHEN IT IS RELEASED PUBLICLY DO FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE A PLAN. I THINK THAT WE HAVE -- OUR BEST THINKING AND THOUGHTS AND THAT THOSE ARE BEING PUT THROUGH THE INTERNAL IT MINISTRATION BUDGET DEVELOPMENT PROCESS TO CLOSE TO A PLAN. SURE YES. I JUST WERE JUST YOU KNOW THIS IS A BIG DEAL I I I WAS OF LEGALIZING MARIJUANA -- BECAUSE I WORRY THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE READY AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE RIGHT PREVENTION-- IN PLACE SO IT'S IT'S YOU GUYS HAVE A REALLY BIG JOB AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT OUR YOUTH THAT'S ALL WELL AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE INITIATIVE IN ADDITION TO REQUIRING THE I. A.'S ALSO REQUIRES A STAKEHOLDER. PROCESS SO SOMETIMES -- EVEN IF WE HAD AS THREE DEPARTMENT SAID THIS IS HOW THE I. A.'S SHOULD WORK BETWEEN US. IT'S COMPLETELY CONCEIVABLE THAT THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WOULD COME AND SAY NO WE DON'T AGREE RIGHT AND YOU WOULD COR YOU WOULD GET FEEDBACK OR YOU WOULD GET EXPERTISE FROM A DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION OUR PARTNER WHERE THEY SAY YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY AND SO I WOULD SAY. THAT THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AN INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS MAY FLOW TOGETHER BASED ON BOTH YOU KNOW I THINK WE TRY VERY MUCH AS AS WE CAN TO ACHIEVE A CONSENSUS BASED. PROPOSAL BUT CERTAINLY NEED THE EXTERNAL PROCESS TO CONFIRM THAT DECISION AS WELL AND SO I. A.'S BETWEEN US ARE ALSO GOING TO BE KIND OF INCOME AND ON THERE BEING AN EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDER PROCESS FOR WHICH THAT FLOWS FROM THE GOVERNOR'S MADE ME PROPOSAL. AND THAT COULDN'T START UNTIL NOW. THE STAKEHOLDER GROUP WHEN WE COULD HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. WELL I THINK IN SOME CASES THE AT WE HAVE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS SEES THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AT THE DEPARTMENT -- WE HAVE BROAD STAKEHOLDER GROUPS WE HAVE USE ADVISORY GROUPS WE HAVE INTERAGENCY PREVENTION. COUNCILS WE HAVE -- A LOT OF DIFFERENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STAKEHOLDER GROUPS I THINK YOU KNOW WITHIN MY DEPARTMENT ALONE NOT TO SPEAK TO YOUR DEPARTMENT -- I PROBABLY HAVE THIRTY OR FORTY DIFFERENT KINDS OF STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THESE WORKGROUPS ADVISORY COMMITTEES AT ANY GIVEN TIME AND SO I THINK THAT -- WE HAVE SOME THINKING WE CERTAINLY HAVE EXISTING PREVENTION PROGRAMS WE HAVE EXISTING PREVENTION CONTRACTS -- AND ADVISORY GROUPS AND SO ALL OF THAT IS GOING INTO DEVELOPING THE THINKING FOR THIS NEW FUND SOURCE AS WELL AS HOW DO WE KIND OF BOTH STRENGTH IN OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND I THINK AGAIN -- DOCTOR COOLEY REFERENCES AS WELL AS WE HAVE CAPACITY IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE HAVE BUILT WE HAVE KNOWN PROGRAMS WE HAVE KNOWN -- PARTNERS AND SO YOU KNOW YOUR FIRST STEP AS A DEPARTMENT IS TO LOOK AND SAY DO I NEED TO RE CREATE SOMETHING AND I THINK THAT THAT IS CERTAINLY PART OF THE THINKING THAT IS UNDER WAY WITHIN. THE NEW ADMINISTRATION THE OTHER THING FOR US IS TO IS BEING CAREFUL THAT WE'RE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS SYSTEM PART IS WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND NOT JUST WHAT THEY WANT TO DO BUT WHAT IS THEIR CAPACITY. BECAUSE WE WON'T BE DOING MOST OF THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND OBVIOUSLY IT WILL BE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND SO. BUT HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH ABSOLUTELY HOW MUCH AVAILABLE BECOMES VERY SORT OF HIGH LEVEL AND FUZZY AND NOT SOMETHING YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE DO INTENSIVELY AND CREATE A PLAN THAT MAY OR MAY NOT ACTUALLY WORK. I'M JUST SORT OF HEARING ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE THINGS THAT YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT ON WEIGHING IN ON HOW THE PROCESS SHOULD WORK THREE THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. WE WOULDN'T WANT TO GET TOO FAR DOWN THE ROAD CREATING UNINTENTIONAL EXPECTATIONS THAT WE THEN CAN'T FOLLOW THROUGH ON WHICH ISN'T SAY WE'RE NOT HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE WE ARE BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE HIGHER LEVEL CONVERSATIONS RATHER THAN BEING THE DETAILED. CONVERSATION. OKAY THANK YOU BOTH. THANK YOU -- AT I HAVE TO SAY THAT CHAIRS -- MAY THE SAME CONCERNS A CENTER LEYVA ABOUT IN TERMS OF TIMING WISE -- BE SURE THAT -- WERE HAVING THE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS WE NEED TO HELP. GET THIS OFF THE GROUND SO THAT IT'S NOT LIKE WHILE WE WAITED TILL THE MONEY SHOWED UP NOW WE HAVE THE MONEY NOW WERE. MARCH MORRELL AND NOTHING HAPPENS RIGHT PEOPLE ARE GONNA SAY WELL GEE YOU KNOW WHAT WERE YOU DOING WITH THIS -- AND SO -- I APPRECIATE THAT -- THERE'S A EFFORT TO GET SOMETHING BY MAY REVISE. MY OTHER HAT CHAIR OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR SOMETHING BEFORE THEN NOT AND NOW F. ONE MAY HITS THERE'S A LOT NOT A LOT OF TIME BETWEEN MAY AND WHEN WE HAVE TO GET THE FINAL BUDGET. NOW RECOGNIZING THAT WE WON'T ACTUALLY REALLY KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY I GUESS WE JUST TOLD A FINANCE UNTIL AUGUST BUT YOU KNOW I THINK. CERTAINLY THERE SHOULD BE MUCH MORE OF AN OUTLINE ABOUT WHERE I APPRECIATE THAT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT FOR STAKEHOLDER WORKGROUP IN TERMS OF GETTING DOWN TO SERVE THE PRESS TAX YOU KNOW YOU DO WANT TO HAVE AN IDEA WHEN AND SO FORTH -- THAT WOULD MEAN JUST GIVE ME SOME CHALLENGES VOLATILITY TOO SO WE'LL KNOW HOW MUCH FOR ONE YEAR RATE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE YEAR AFTER RIGHT SO AND AND AND BUT I THINK THERE ARE PERHAPS SOME CONVERSATIONS THAT CAN ALREADY BE HAD WE RE RAISE SOME OF THEM. RIGHT HERE IN THIS HEARING ABOUT. SO STAKEHOLDERS -- KNOWING THAT WE WILL ONLY KNOW ONE YOUR DOORS MONEY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NEXT YEARS WILL BE -- IS GOING TO GO UP SAY THE SAME GO DOWN -- THAT HOW DO YOU WANT TO HANDLE THIS WE HEARD SOME FEEDBACK ABOUT WELL MAYBE WHAT WE DO IS IN ORDER TO QUOTE MAKE A DIFFERENCE WE NEEDED TO HIT A CERTAIN AMOUNT SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY PUSH A CERTAIN LEVEL OF SERVICE OUT RIGHT SO DO WE DO WE HAVE. SOME KIND OF SO SOME OF THOSE KIND OF DISCUSSIONS. GUESTS AND THE END OF THE BAR HEALTHCARE SERVICE VERY LARGE I'M SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH THE YOU MENTIONED ALL THE STATE OVER THE BUT ALL THE STAKEHLDER GROUPS ARE. DEALING WITH THIS FUN DIRTY IN THIS OR EVEN WITH USE RIGHT -- SO. SO WHAT KIND OF CONVERSATIONS ARE YOU CRRENTLY HAVING WITH STAKEHOLDER GROUPS ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR FUND [inaudible] RIGHT NOW. SO I MEAN I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROGRAMS RE DOING AND THERE'S A WONDERFUL RIGHT AROUND A FEW AIDS AND AND EDUCATION AND SO FORTH AND I THINK THOSE INFORMED WHAT WE WANT TO TRY TO DO WITH THIS AND AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT. WE DON'T TREAT THIS AS A SEPARATE SILO THAT'S COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM EVERYTHING ELSE WHO I CONNECTED SO I APPRECIATE THAT PRESENTATION. BUT I'M ALSO FOR THIS HEARING. WHERE WOULD YOU SEE THIS FUND FIT AND WHAT'S THE CT AND MORE SPECIFICALLY WHAT IS THE CONVERSATION WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT HOW? WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS YOU KNOW GREAT OPERA TIONS SO THERE'S FLEXIBILITY IT'S OF SOME UNCERTAIN AMOUNTS IT'S PROBABLY NOT AT THE SCALE NECESSARILY O SOME OF THE OTHER FUNDS THAT YOU MAY HAVE POSSIBLY I DON'T KNOW WE DON'T KNOW BUT PROBABLY TO ASSUME IT'S NOT GONNA BE QUITE. THAT LARGE BUT IF THEY CAN BE VERY NIMBLE POTENTIALLY POTENTIALLY RIGHT BECAUSE THE LACK OF RESTRICTIONS SO DOLLARS WE DON'T -- SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE BEING HAD WITH STAKEHOLDERS A NOW ABOUT WHAT A WHOLE WHERE'S THIS FATTY OF THIS KIND OF MONEY BEST FIT. TO SPEAK FOR OUR DEPARTMENT -- WE HAVE HAD FROM THE THERE EVEN BEFORE PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR PASSED AN ONGOING CONVERSATION WITH OUR PARTNERS PARTICULARLY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BUT ALSO. YOU KNOW THE THE NONPROFIT AND FOUNDATIONS ABOUT THE ISSUE OF CANNABIS AND WHAT IS WHAT IS PREVENTION THAT IS SEPARATE FROM TREATMENT. AND FOR US SPECIFICALLY WE DON'T WANT. TO SOMETHING THAT VETS DUPLICATIVE BECAUSE IT IMPACTS OF THIS USED TO SERVICES IN IN PART OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES BUT PUBLIC HEALTH DOES. HAVE SORT OF STANDARD ROLES IN ISSUES LIKE THIS INCLUDES THINGS LIKE THE ACQUISITION ANALYSIS OF DATA MONITORING EVALUATION -- PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS ETCETERA AND SO WE'VE HAD VERY -- GENERAL CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IS IT IN TERMS OF THAT THOSE OF US IN THE IN THE BROADER PUBLIC HEALTH ARENA. THINK IS OUR LIKELY TO BE OUR ROLE SHOULD FINDING BECOME AVAILABLE AND WHAT DO PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO SEE AND SO THOSE ARE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY HAVING. AND THEY ARE INFORMING OUR CONVERSATIONS IT REALLY DOES COME OUT WHAT IS IT THAT. AFTER THAT WE WANT TO DO WITHOUT FUNDING AND WHO ARE WHO WE WANT TO ENGAGE IN THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WHERE. THE GENERAL CONVERSATIONS LEAD TO THE MUCH MORE SPECIFIC ONCE ONCE WE HAVE THE I. A.'S AND WE KNOW WHO'S DOING WHAT. SURE AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD BOTH -- WITH ME PERSONALLY AND AS WELL AS MY STAFF IN VARIOUS FORUMS AND MEETINGS AND CONFERENCES -- WE HAVE CERTAINLY HEARD FROM FOLKS THEY'RE THINKING IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW CERTAINLY A LOT OF GROUPS HAVE REALLY -- BEEN PREDOMINATELY PUSHING A PREVENTION FOCUS -- YOU KNOW PHILOSOPHY SLASH YOU KNOW AND IMPERATIVE AND I THINK THAT WE WOULD AGREE BROADLY WITH THAT BEING. PART OF KIND OF A DELIBERATE OF PROCESS FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO COMMIT. TO I THINK THAT WE HAVE HEARD AND BASED ON THE PREVIOUS PANELS -- POINT IS THAT THERE IS A STRONG TENSION BETWEEN TREATMENT AND PREVENTION AND SO THERE ARE DYNAMICS -- FROM THE EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS THAT -- ARE LEANING AND THEN CERTAINLY THE SCHOOLS -- WOULD BE A THIRD DYNAMIC IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW IS IS IT A PREVENTION OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOLS AS A PREVENTION WITHIN THE SCHOOLS AND THEN YOU CERTAINLY HAVE A TREATMENT. PROVIDER CAPACITY SO I THINK WE HAVE IN THE MEETINGS AND CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD HAVE BEEN MORE IN A RECEPTIVE TELL US YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND THOUGHTS -- I CERTAINLY WOULD AGREE WITH BOTH THE ELLIE OWES RIGHT UP AS WELL AS THE SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDERS. PERSPECTIVES ON LEARNING LESSONS AROUND OTHER TYPES OF VOLATILE FUNDS SOURCES SO WE ALSO ADMINISTER THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WE ALSO ADMINISTER PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX WE ALSO. HAVE A DEAF A LOT OF DIFFERENT VOLATILE FUND SOURCES THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY TIED TO THE MEDICAID PROGRAM AND I WOULD AGREE THAT A LOT OF THOSE LESSONS THAT WERE NOTED IN THE MATERIALS. ARE CERTAINLY THINGS THAT WE OURSELVES HAVE BOTH AS SEEN IN AGREED WITH AND I THINK THAT ALL KIND OF INFORMS. THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE DEVELOPING FOR YOU KNOW FOR PURPOSES OF THAT OF THE GOVERNOR AND HIS HIS NEW ADMINISTRATION TEAM. I I LET MY COLLEAGUE STEPHANIE PROVIDE SOME OF THE DETAIL BUT WE WOULD WE WOULD AGREE THAT THE DEPARTMENTS LOOKING AT THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE WHAT WHERE ARE WE WHERE WE GOING. HOW WE'RE GONNA GET THERE WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WHEN WE GET THERE? WE HAVE A NUMBER OF MECHANISMS ALREADY IN PLACES AS DEPUTY JACKSON SAID -- AND THE STRUCTURES BEEN BUILT THROUGH OUR TOBACCO PREVENTION PROGRAM BUT WE ALSO HAVE PROCESSES THAT INVITE REQUIRE ACTUALLY STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION THROUGH THE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANNING. PROCESS AND ALSO THE SCHOOL SAFE PROCESS BOTH OF THOSE -- HAVE EXISTING REQUIREMENTS TO INCLUDE THE COMMUNITY AND TO INCLUDE PARENTS AND GUARDIANS RESIDENTS OF THIS I HAVE HAVE CONVERSATIONS BEEN HAD IT THOSE THAT THOSE TYPE PROGRAMS ON THIS PARTICULAR THE U. PIZZA I GUESS SO. THAT MY ATTEMPT TO TRY TO TURN THIS PUMPING INTO AN ACRONYM -- THOSE FUNDS SO I RECOGNIZE YOU HAVE THOSE MECHANISMS IN PLACE FOR STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AROUND THESE OTHER ISSUES BUT I'M A PARTICULAR CARES ABOUT WHAT CONVERSATIONS HAD EVERY ARE. CURRENTLY HAPPENING ARE HAPPENED THE PAST SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THIS FUND AND HOW WE SHOULD. USE THESE FUNDS. I BELIEVE IN YOUR PACKAGE IS THE THE LETTER THE SUMMARY LETTER OF THE EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS GROUP THAT WE PARTICIPATED IN THAT. DOCTOR COOLER MENTIONED IN AND OUT -- DEPUTY JACKSON MENTIONED OUR INTERNAL CONVERSATIONS AS WELL OKAY. ALL RIGHT NOW. 889-8 I CERTAINLY -- DO I RECOGNIZE -- DIRECTOR CAN YOU SAID THAT PREVENTION MONIES USUALLY THE HARDER ONE TO GET TO SO WHAT WE HAVE THIS TENSION -- THAT -- CERTAINLY WILL BE SURE THAT -- PREVENTION IS SOMETHING THAT -- WE ADEQUATELY FUND AND HOW WE FIT THIS AND I PUT AGAIN PRE SHEET PRESENTATION ABOUT THE OTHER ACTIVITIES BECAUSE THIS IS A STANDALONE THIS SHE DID THAT AND HOPEFULLY HELP US LEVERAGE. OTHER BOTH ACTIVITIES OUR FINDINGS -- SOURCES THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE -- TO TO LEVERAGE SO WHETHER IT'S ON EDUCATION OR HEALTH OR PUBLIC HEALTH. AND OTHER GRANTS AND OTHER STATES PROGRAMS FIRM AND I FAILED TO MENTION AS WELL AS I THINK YOU KNOW LOOKING ACROSS THE SPECTRUM -- CERTAINLY. IT YOU KNOW THERE'S ALSO PROPOSALS IN THE IN THE BUDGET AROUND TRYING TO SCREENING FOR BOTH PEDIATRIC AND ADULT POPULATIONS. I THINK THAT -- WE'RE TRYING REALLY HARD TO KIND OF CONSISTENTLY -- LOOK IN TERMS OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE BEING MADE AND HOW THEY KIND OF INTER LINK WITH EACH OTHER AND SO YOU KNOW. THOSE ARE ALL KIND OF YOU KNOW CERTAINLY NOT BEING TAKEN AND I SILLY SOON WITH EACH OTHER AND SO -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER ON SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AS WELL AS IT PERTAINS TO THE TRAUMA SCREENS. TRAUMA INFORMED CARE HOW ARE YOU BUILDING THE SERVICES AND CERTAINLY UNDERSTANDING THAT. THESE -- SPECIFIC DEDICATED FUNDS BECAUSE CERTAINLY HELP EITHER STRETCH OR INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF THE THAT ARE ALSO BEING PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION. PAYING WELL I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING -- FIGURE YOU NEED SOME TIME TO WORK ON THIS MORE EXTENDED SCOTIAN ABOUT THIS MATTER BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING. THANK YOU ARE LEYVA. THANK YOU. I HAD HOPED TO COME HERE TODAY AND HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND A CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING WHAT YOU GUYS BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS -- BUT I I HAVE TO SAY I FEEL LIKE IT'S ABOUT AS CLEAR AS MUD.

AND DOES THAT BELONG TO AN APARTMENT OR A GROUP OF PEOPLE NO IT BELONGS TO THE KIDS RIGHT SO THAT'S ONE THING. THE OTHER THING IS WE CAN'T LOSE IN THIS CONVERSATION. THE IMPORTANT THING THAT HAPPENS WITH FOSTER KIDS AND HOMELESS KIDS WHO ARE THE MOST IN NEED AT LEAST ON THE TREATMENT AND AND THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO SCHOOLS AND DOESN'T HAPPEN THROUGH MOST PART TREATMENT PROGRAMS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE TREATMENT PROGRAMS FOR KIDS SO. WHAT I THINK WE WOULD RECOMMEND IS STOP [inaudible] STEP BACK. AND DO WHAT THE ONE THING THAT EVERYONE IN THE WORKGROUP AGREED TO WHAT USED TO US AN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT'S OUT THERE WHAT WORKS WHAT DOESN'T AND THEN BUILD THE PLAN. SOMEONE TELL WE DO THAT WE'RE JUST FOR ONE LIKE SPIT BALLS AT THE WALL. RIGHT I MEAN I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THERE ARE STANDARDS IN OTHER STATES THEIR STANDARDS IN NEW JERSEY.

I PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO FOCUS ON THE WHOLE CYCLE OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE EDUCATION PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT. ARE TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE ON THE GROUND TELLS US THAT PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION ARE CRITICAL TO BREAKING THE CYCLE OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND YET IS OFTEN OR SEE THE LEAST ATTENTION OR FUNDING. TOO MANY FAMILIES GRAPPLE WITH INTERGENERATIONAL TRAUMA WHICH IS OFTEN TIED WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND ABUSE AND AS PROFOUND EFFECTS ON PARENTS AND ON OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN. BREAKING THE CYCLE OF TRAUMA AND FAMILIES IS A KEY ELEMENT OF PREVENTION THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN SUBSTANCE MISUSE AND POOR CHILD OUTCOMES IS CLEAR. PIANO DRUG USE IS KNOWN TO CAUSE NEGATIVE BIRTH OUTCOMES SUCH AS LOW BIRTH WEIGHT FEEDING DIFFICULTIES INCREASED IRRITABILITY BY THE END PH#N AND STANTON COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT. FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS FIRST RISE ACROSS THE STATE HAVE SUPPORTED FAMILY RESILIENCY PROGRAMS THAT WORK WITH BOTH FAMILY AND CHILD'S PREVENT POOR OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN. THE GOALS OF PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR AROUND EDUCATION PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT COMPLETELY ALIGNED WITH EVIDENCE BASED TO GENERATIONAL FAMILY RESILIENCY PROGRAMS. THAT STRENGTHEN FAMILIES SUCH AS HOME VISITING PARENTING GROUPS PARENT CHILD GROUPS AND HEALTH RELATED SYSTEMS BUT FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND TRADING STRATEGIES ARE PRIORITIZED IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF PROPOSITIONS EXPIRE FUNDS THANK YOU.

THIRTEEN HUNDRED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN NEARLY SEVEN MILLION PATIENTS OF THE POP SIXTY FOUR COALITION OF WHICH WE ARE PART OF HAS AGREE ON A SET OF PRINCIPLES -- THAT WE HOPE -- THE LEGISLATIVE -- AT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WILL CONSIDER WHEN ALLOCATING POP SIXTY FOUR REVENUE FUNDING AND SPECIFICALLY I'D LIKE. TO ADD -- REALLY INTO THE 60% TREATMENT FOR YOU -- AND WE WOULD -- WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO HELP DETERMINE THE PARTIES FOR THESE FUNDS. IMPRIME PARAMETERS AND HOW THESE BY SHOULD BE USED THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON FLOW JUNKO FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES. I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO MANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT ALREADY MADE ABOUT EQUITY AND THIS BEING A WAY TO BE ABLE TO REPAIR SOME OF THE DAMAGE DONE BY THE WAR ON DRUGS AND THIS IS A RESTORATIVE -- FIND I'D ALSO LIKE TO ECHO THE THE YOU PRIORITY A PREVENTION BUT IN PARTICULAR I'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT WE THINK ABOUT PREVENTION THEIR AGE RANGES HERE WERE TREATMENT IS JUST NOT GOING TO BE APPROPRIATE WE'RE NOT GONNA BE DOING A WHOLE LOT OF SUBSTANCE. ABUSE TREATMENT FOR KIDS UNDER TEN AND SO WE FOCUS ON SPENDING THE MAJORITY OF THIS MONEY ON TREATMENT SERVICES IT MEANS THAT WE'RE MISSING OUT ON A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST BEFORE HAND TO THE WE'RE TREATING FEWER PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE. FEDERAL LIKE FOR US TO CONSIDER THAT AS ONE OF THE BILL OR RUBRICS BY WHICH WE DECIDE HOW WE'RE GOING -- TO TO ALLOCATE THE FUNDS IN ADDITION I ALSO WANT TO THINK ABOUT -- SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID EARLIER ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY AND CAPACITY AND SO WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW FUNDS CAN BE ALLOCATED AND WHICH ORGANIZATIONS TO INVEST IN REALLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE GOING TO BE THE SUSTAINABLE -- INVESTMENT THAT OCCURRING COMMUNITIES IT IS A ROBUST AND WE'RE THINKING BROADLY ABOUT HOW WE'RE DOING RESTORATIVE WORK AS A RELEASE THE CHILDREN IN THESE COMMUNITIES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

DECISION MAKING SKILLS AND ALSO ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN POSITIVE ACTIVITIES WHICH ALL WILL HELP WITH PREVENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE BUT ALSO TREAT THEM AS WELL. AS ASK THAT WE EVALUATE THE SERVICES YES WE NEED TO ADDRESS RISK FACTORS BUT I HOPE WE TAKE MORE OF A STRENGTH BASED APPROACH REPROACH AND FOCUS ON BUILDING UPON. ON THE PROTECTIVE FACTORS THAT YOU'VE ALREADY HAVE. ADDITIONALLY I HOPE THAT AS WE ASSESS PROGRAMS I THINK ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD FIND THAT WE MEANING FULLY INVOLVED THE VOICES OF YOUTH THEY THEMSELVES SHOULD BE SEEN AS ON AS EXPERTS ON WHAT ARE AFFECTED PROGRAMS. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BECAUSE CURRENTLY DCS DOES HAVE A YOUTH ADVISORY GROUP WHICH HAS FIFTEEN MEMBERS ZERO FROM WHERE YOUTH -- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT WHILE THERE IS THERE IS A FOCUS ON PREVENTION I WOULD LIKE TO SEE TREATMENT IS ALSO IMPORTANT -- AND I WOULD HOPE THAT AS WE CONSIDER TRETMENT OPTIONS THAT WE EXPAND THE DEFINITIONS OF WHAT QUALIFIES TREATMENT AND WHAT QUALIFIES AS QUALIFY TREATMENT PROVIDERS AND I HOPE THAT THOSE DEFINITIONS GO OUTSIDE. OF EXISTING CLINICAL LICENSING AND CREDENTIALING STRUCTURES BECAUSE OF MY EXPERIENCE WITH YOU CAN EVEN ADDRESSES I'M GROUPS YOUTH RESPOND MOST EFFECTIVELY TO CULTURALLY RELEVANT PROGRAMS THAT EXIST IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WITH PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO THEM.

I THINK IT'SREALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND -- WHEN WE'VE TALKED TO HUNDREDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN RICHMOND WEST CONTRA COSTA COUNTY NUMBER ONE COPING MECHANISM FOR TRAUMA DISTRESS IS SMOKING MARIJUANA NOT BECAUSE IT'S RECREATIONAL THEY'RE COPING WITH TH ATMOSPHERE TRAUMA THEY ARE IN?

I ALSO ASK THAT WE REALLY STAY AWAY FROM EVIDENCE THESE PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY PATHOLOGY EYES AND STIGMATIZE YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR AND OUTCOMES ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE DRIVEN BY YOUNG PEOPLE AND OUR COMMUNITIES THAT CANNOT BE ACTUALLY DECIDED BY THE STATE -- AS A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION WE ARE -- VERY BURDENED BY THE OUTCOMES IN THE COMPLIANCE MECHANISMS OF STATES -- AND AND THE STATE -- AGENCIES AND THEY DON'T MATCH UP TO WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE NEED WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE WANT AN OFTEN THEY'RE VERY DEHUMANIZING SO WE HOPE TO SEE WHAT THE CONVENING THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU.
