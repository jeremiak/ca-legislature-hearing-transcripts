01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:52.181
LOWER THE PENALTIES FOR SMALLER

01:05:52.248 --> 01:05:52.715
PRODUCERS YOU FALL OUT OF

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.784
COMPLIANCE. ON COMPLIANCE FOR

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:56.452
PRODUCERS NOT MEETING THE RATES

01:05:56.519 --> 01:05:57.787
BEYOND THE FLEXIBILITY THE

01:05:57.853 --> 01:05:58.788
DEPARTMENT HAS TO ADJUST THE

01:05:58.854 --> 01:06:00.256

DEVELOPING A CORRECTIVE ACTION

01:06:06.095 --> 01:06:11.033
PLAN THAT LAYS. OUT HOW THEY'LL

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:11.767
COME INTO COMPLIANCE. THE NEW

01:06:11.834 --> 01:06:12.401
AMENDMENTS MAKE THAT PRODUCERS

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:13.769
ARE. KERR ACTION DON'T ACCRUE

01:06:13.836 --> 01:06:14.737
PENALTIES THAT'S ANOTHER

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.472
IMPORTANT THING. THAT WE

01:06:17.907 --> 01:06:18.474
WITH BUSINESS OUR GOAL HERE IS

01:06:18.541 --> 01:06:20.843
NOT TO BE PUNITIVE. BUT TO GET

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:23.312
COMPLIANCE IT'S TO PRODUCE PUSH

01:06:23.379 --> 01:06:23.946
PRODUCERS TO GET TO THE

01:06:24.013 --> 01:06:25.681
RECYCLING RATES. STAKEHOLDERS

01:06:25.748 --> 01:06:26.615

ENSURE THE RECYCLERS AND-

01:06:30.586 --> 01:06:31.954

ENSURE THAT A FINAL JUSTICE

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:38.627
GROUPS WERE INVOLVED. AND NOW

01:06:38.694 --> 01:06:39.729
LET'S TALK ABOUT STEWARDSHIP

01:06:39.795 --> 01:06:41.397
ORGANIZATION THE BILL INCLUDES

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:42.565
STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR

01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:43.666
PRODUCERS CHOOSING TO FORM A

STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION WE

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:46.035
LEARNED A LOT FROM OUR MATTRESS

01:06:46.102 --> 01:06:47.236
IN OUR BATTERIES PROGRAMS AND-

01:06:47.303 --> 01:06:48.304
ALL THE CHALLENGES THATTHEY'VE

01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:50.706

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:52.174
HERE SPECIFICALLY TO AVOID

01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:53.576
PREVIOUS PITFALLS THE BILL ALSO

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:54.710
MAKES CLEAR THAT NO ENTITY CAN

01:06:54.777 --> 01:06:56.479
BE REQUIRED. TO JOIN A STORAGE

01:06:56.545 --> 01:06:57.913
OF ORGANIZATION IS ENTIRELY

01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:01.117
VOLUNTARY ACTS. BY THE PRODUCER.

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:02.184
WE ALSO HAD A LANGUAGE

01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:02.918
CAREFULLY BALANCING THE

01:07:02.985 --> 01:07:04.186
CONCERNS RAISED BY THE HAULERS

01:07:04.253 --> 01:07:05.654
WITH THOSE OF THE PRODUCERS TO

01:07:05.721 --> 01:07:06.655
ENSURE THE FRANCHISE CONTRACTS

01:07:06.722 --> 01:07:08.190
ARE PROTECTED. WHILE PRODUCERS

01:07:08.257 --> 01:07:09.258
PARTICULARLY THOSE FORMING

01:07:09.325 --> 01:07:10.459

PRODUCERS RIGHT THEY'RE NOT

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:09.411
PRODUCERS SELLING. SO WHEN THIS

01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:11.480

THE RULES IN. BUSINESS STEPPED

01:10:07.803 --> 01:10:09.838

01:21:14.836 --> 01:21:15.604
HAVE GOTTEN NOTIFICATION THAT

01:21:15.670 --> 01:21:17.672
AMBROSIA A VERY WELL KNOWN AND

01:21:17.739 --> 01:21:20.075
WELL LIKED AND CAFE IS CLOSING

01:21:20.141 --> 01:21:22.377
ITS DOORS FOR GOOD. AND THEY

01:21:22.444 --> 01:21:23.411
WERE ABLE TO MAKE IT THROUGH

01:21:23.478 --> 01:21:24.579
THE PANDEMIC WITH ALL THE

01:21:24.646 --> 01:21:27.249
REQUIREMENTS- IT HAD TO BE MET

01:21:27.315 --> 01:21:28.516
IN ORDER TO SURVIVE IN THE

01:21:28.583 --> 01:21:31.019
HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY. SO THOSE

01:21:31.086 --> 01:21:33.054
EMPLOYEES I WILL NOT HAVE A JOB

01:21:33.121 --> 01:21:34.656
TO GO BACK TO YOU AND TO THE

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:36.825
CURRENT OWNER EVAN BROSIUS. IF

01:21:36.891 --> 01:21:39.928
AMBROSIA OPENS AT AM AND OUR

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:41.196
NEW OWNERSHIP MY QUESTION IS

01:21:41.263 --> 01:21:43.331
THAT WITH THE NEW OWNER REQUIRE

01:21:43.398 --> 01:21:45.066
BE REQUIRED TO HIRE THE

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:46.635
EMPLOYEES THAT WERE LET GO FROM

01:21:46.701 --> 01:21:48.870
THE PREVIOUS OWNER OF THAT

01:21:48.937 --> 01:21:50.839
BUSINESS- SO THAT WOULD APPLY

01:21:50.905 --> 01:21:52.941
TO ALL BUSINESSES STATEWIDE AND

01:21:53.008 --> 01:21:53.708
I WOULD JUST LIKE A RESPONSE ON

01:21:53.775 --> 01:21:57.345
THAT. ON MY OWN TIME AGAIN I

01:21:57.412 --> 01:21:59.214
WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT-

01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:00.682
THERE IS AN EXEMPTION THERE IS

01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:01.750
AN EXEMPTION THAT REQUIRES THE

01:22:01.816 --> 01:22:04.686
STILL- THAT THAT IS IN THIS

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:05.754
BILL FOR EXISTING UNION

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.722
CONTRACTS- DEALING WITH

01:22:07.789 --> 01:22:10.892
RETENTION AND SO I GUESS MY BIG

01:22:10.959 --> 01:22:13.728
BEEF WITH ALL OF THIS IS THAT.

01:22:13.795 --> 01:22:17.132
I'M NOT ONLY DO I THINK IT'S

01:22:17.198 --> 01:22:19.234
VERY. ON BUSY IS JUST WITH A

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:21.369
TRANSFERS. IF THAT'S THE CASE

01:22:21.436 --> 01:22:23.138
AND BUT IT IS ALSO EXTREMELY

01:22:23.204 --> 01:22:24.506
DIFFICULT TO SUPPORT A BILL

01:22:24.572 --> 01:22:26.508
THAT. YOU SAY THAT YOU WANT TO

01:22:26.574 --> 01:22:27.976
PROTECT WORKERS BUT WE DON'T

01:22:28.043 --> 01:22:29.811
SERVE PROTECT THOSE UNDER

01:22:29.878 --> 01:22:31.346
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT

01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:32.547
AND AGAIN AS I MENTIONED A

01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:33.548
COUPLE OF DAYS AGO IN MY

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:35.483
COMMENTS. SEVERAL OF THESE FARM

01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:36.818
PACKING HOUSES THAT ARE UNDER

01:22:36.885 --> 01:22:38.219
UNION AGREEMENT WITH THE U. S.

01:22:38.286 --> 01:22:40.755
W. HAVE LOST. AND YOU KNOW

01:22:40.822 --> 01:22:43.491
SEVERAL PEOPLE TO FATALITIES.

01:22:43.558 --> 01:22:44.759
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T NEGOTIATE A

01:22:44.826 --> 01:22:46.528
CONTRACT- OR THEY CAN'T GET THE

01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:48.596
CONTRACT- INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

01:22:48.663 --> 01:22:49.798
IN CHARGE OF THE CONTRACT TO BE

01:22:49.864 --> 01:22:51.599
ABLE TO. PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:53.568
SAFETY OR DO ADDITIONAL THINGS

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:54.669
THAT NEED TO BE DONE THAT ARE

01:22:54.736 --> 01:22:56.037
RESTRICTIVE ON ANOTHER EMPLOYER

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:56.938
THAT WOULD HAVE TO BEABLE TO

01:22:57.005 --> 01:22:58.206
PROVIDE THOSE THINGS. BECAUSE

01:22:58.273 --> 01:22:59.641
EVERY EMPLOYER WANTS TO MAKE

01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:01.209
SURE THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE SAFE.

01:23:01.276 --> 01:23:02.344
BUT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT

01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:03.445
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO CONTRACT

01:23:03.511 --> 01:23:05.480
TO PROVE WHEN THINGS FIRST. SO

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:06.281
GOING BACK TO THIS PARTICULAR

01:23:06.348 --> 01:23:08.316
BILL. I GUESS I HAVE A HUGE

01:23:08.383 --> 01:23:09.451
CONCERN THAT IT DOESN'T COVER

01:23:09.517 --> 01:23:11.286
ALL EMPLOYEES. BUT MOSTLY I

01:23:11.353 --> 01:23:13.555
NEED SOME ANSWERS ON THE- THE

01:23:13.621 --> 01:23:15.223
TRANSFER OR SALE OF THE

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:16.624
BUSINESS WOULD THAT BE A

01:23:16.691 --> 01:23:17.959
REQUIREMENT FOR THE NEW OWNER

01:23:18.026 --> 01:23:18.893
TO BRING BACK THE EMPLOYEES

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.829
UNDER THE PREVIOUS OWNERSHIP.

01:23:20.895 --> 01:23:24.232
IF YOU COULD ANSWER THAT THAT

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:26.234
WOULD BE GREAT AND- THANK YOU

01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:28.269
SENATOR NELSON YOU'RE FINE.

01:23:28.336 --> 01:23:30.004
THANK YOU MOVING ON TO SENATOR

01:23:30.071 --> 01:23:34.042
MELINDA'S. THANK YOU MR

01:23:34.109 --> 01:23:35.677
PRESIDENT- I ALSO HAVE A

01:23:35.744 --> 01:23:37.779
QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR BRING TO

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:39.347
THE TIME PERIOD IT'S OUTLINED

01:23:39.414 --> 01:23:44.519
IN THIS BILL- THIS. IS IN PLACE

01:23:44.586 --> 01:23:45.653
FOR A DETERRENT FOR THE EXTENT

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.956
OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY BUT WE

01:23:48.022 --> 01:23:50.458
HAVE. SEVERAL STATE EMERGENCIES

01:23:50.525 --> 01:23:52.794
IN FACT SEVENTY ACCORDING TO MY

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:54.896
NOTES ON THAT WERE ONGOING SO

01:23:54.963 --> 01:23:56.898
SAVE EMERGENCY CAN GO ON FOR A

01:23:56.965 --> 01:23:59.000
LONG PERIOD OF TIME. AMONG

01:23:59.067 --> 01:24:00.935
DECEMBER TWENTY THIRD JUST OF

01:24:01.002 --> 01:24:01.836
LAST YEAR GOVERNOR NEESON

01:24:01.903 --> 01:24:04.439
TERMINATED MORE THAN SEVENTY

01:24:04.506 --> 01:24:05.340
ONGOING STATE OF EMERGENCY THAT

01:24:05.407 --> 01:24:06.307
HAD BEEN DECLARED AT VARIOUS

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:08.143
TIMES IF SOMEONE IS DATED BACK

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:09.277
TO THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND

01:24:09.344 --> 01:24:11.279
ELEVEN. SO IT DOESN'T APPEAR

01:24:11.346 --> 01:24:12.680
THAT THIS BILL IS LIMITED TO

01:24:12.747 --> 01:24:14.315
JUST THE STATE OF EMERGENCY

01:24:14.382 --> 01:24:15.683
RELATING TO KIND OF ADD ON

01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:16.851
MEGAN WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE

01:24:16.918 --> 01:24:18.520
GOVERNOR WILL DECLARE AN END TO

01:24:18.586 --> 01:24:20.288
THIS DATA THAT EMERGENCY. SO I

01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:22.123
THINK WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW

01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:23.124
THAT COULD BE PROBLEMATIC FOR

01:24:23.191 --> 01:24:24.426
SOME OF THESE BUSINESSES IF

01:24:24.492 --> 01:24:26.461
THIS GOES ON FOR YEARS LIKE

01:24:26.528 --> 01:24:27.462
SOME OF THE STATE OR MERGING

01:24:27.529 --> 01:24:31.633
TEAMS HAVE GONE. ON TO I WONDER

01:24:31.699 --> 01:24:32.167
IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT

01:24:32.233 --> 01:24:34.502
PLEASE. THANK YOU ANY

01:24:34.569 --> 01:24:36.137
ADDITIONAL- DISCUSSION OR

01:24:36.204 --> 01:24:40.842
DEBATE. HEARING C. NINE SENATOR

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:43.111
RAZA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

01:24:43.178 --> 01:24:47.849
YES AGAIN THE GOAL OF THIS IS

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:50.185
FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES TO KNOW

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:51.352
THAT THEY CAN GO BACK TO THEIR

01:24:51.419 --> 01:24:54.756
JOB THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL FACT

01:24:54.823 --> 01:24:57.425
THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE HERE- IF

01:24:57.492 --> 01:24:59.594
THERE IS A NEW EMPLOYER THAT

01:24:59.661 --> 01:25:01.796
EMPLOYER WILL ALSO HAVE TO HIRE

01:25:01.863 --> 01:25:03.798
THOSE WORKERS BACK. FOR AT

01:25:03.865 --> 01:25:05.400
LEAST NINETY DAYS AND THEN BE

01:25:05.467 --> 01:25:07.368
ABLE TO EVALUATE THEM BUT

01:25:07.435 --> 01:25:08.837
THERE'S NO REASON IF IT

01:25:08.903 --> 01:25:09.971
CONTINUES TO BE A RESTAURANT

01:25:10.038 --> 01:25:12.407
WHY THE SUCCESSOR EMPLOYER

01:25:12.474 --> 01:25:13.308
SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE THEM

01:25:13.374 --> 01:25:16.478
BACK- I'M NOT QUITE SURE ABOUT

01:25:16.544 --> 01:25:18.246
THE ISSUE OF THE EMERGENCY

01:25:18.313 --> 01:25:20.114
OTHER THAN. IF THERE'S AN

01:25:20.181 --> 01:25:21.316

01:25:23.384 --> 01:25:27.021
MORE DETAILS THAN THAT I JUST

01:25:27.088 --> 01:25:27.922
WANT TO END IF I CAN MR WOULD

LEGISLATION THAT SPECIFIES A

02:16:26.945 --> 02:16:28.346

HAVE DISCRETION. BUT MORE

02:17:36.548 --> 02:17:38.083
IMPORTANTLY THE POINT THAT YOU

02:17:38.149 --> 02:17:39.818
WOULD ACTUALLY RAISE EXACTLY

02:17:39.884 --> 02:17:40.552
WHAT'S ADDRESSED HERE IN THE

02:17:40.619 --> 02:17:42.454

I'M READING FROM THE MEASURE.

02:17:46.291 --> 02:17:47.225
THE DEPARTMENT DETERMINES THAT

02:17:47.292 --> 02:17:48.426
THE EMPLOYER COULD NOT MEET THE

02:17:48.493 --> 02:17:49.427
REQUIREMENTS TO THE ISSUES

02:17:49.494 --> 02:17:50.929
BEYOND OUR CONTROL SUCH AS THE

02:17:52.564 --> 02:17:53.398
EQUIPMENT NEEDED TO MEET THE

02:17:53.465 --> 02:17:54.566
REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SECTION

HAS BEEN ORDERED FROM THE

02:17:58.336 --> 02:18:00.005
DAMAGED OR STOLEN. OKAY SO

02:18:00.071 --> 02:18:02.307
BASICALLY IT DOES PROVIDE FOR

02:18:02.374 --> 02:18:05.243
THAT FLEXIBILITY OF COURSE I

02:18:05.310 --> 02:18:06.578
HOPE THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION.

02:18:06.645 --> 02:18:09.681
THANK YOU. M. I'M MY OWN TIME I

02:18:09.748 --> 02:18:11.449

02:18:11.516 --> 02:18:12.150
ALTHOUGH I APPRECIATE THE

02:18:12.217 --> 02:18:13.918
AUTHOR'S RESPONSE. ON THOSE

02:18:13.985 --> 02:18:16.087
QUESTIONS- MY GREAT CONCERN IS

02:18:16.154 --> 02:18:18.056
NUMBER ONE IF THE INFORMATION

02:18:18.123 --> 02:18:22.527
IS OR IF THE PRODUCT THE. PP

02:18:22.594 --> 02:18:23.161
PER PERSON PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT

02:18:23.228 --> 02:18:23.795
IS NOT AVAILABLE. AND I UNDER.

02:18:23.862 --> 02:18:24.429
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PROVE

02:18:24.496 --> 02:18:25.697
THAT THEY'VE ALREADY PLACED THE

02:18:25.764 --> 02:18:28.700
ORDER- BUT EVEN. IF YOU LOOK

02:18:28.767 --> 02:18:30.168
BACK AT THEM THE BILLION DOLLAR

02:18:30.235 --> 02:18:31.936
MASS STILL PER SE JUST FOR AN

02:18:32.003 --> 02:18:34.506
EXAMPLE. WE LOST RESOURCES ON

02:18:34.572 --> 02:18:36.274
THAT PARTICULAR BILL BECAUSE WE

02:18:36.341 --> 02:18:38.176
HAD TO PUT A DEPOSIT AT FRIENDS

02:18:38.243 --> 02:18:38.710
AND THERE WERE SOME OTHER

02:18:38.777 --> 02:18:40.311
THINGS THAT WE HAD TO DO. AND

02:18:40.378 --> 02:18:41.112
ALTHOUGH I THINK THE GOVERNOR

02:18:41.179 --> 02:18:42.380
DID EVERYTHING HE COULD TO MAKE

02:18:42.447 --> 02:18:43.715
SURE THE MONEY WAS SECURED

02:18:43.782 --> 02:18:44.983
USING THE RIGHT ATTORNEYS AND

02:18:45.050 --> 02:18:46.751
STAFF THERE WAS STILL. REVENUES

02:18:46.818 --> 02:18:48.553
THAT WERE TAX REVENUES TO THE

02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:49.954
STATE OF CALIFORNIA CITIZENS

02:18:50.021 --> 02:18:52.157
THAT LOST- ON THAT. PARTICULAR

02:18:52.223 --> 02:18:54.726
BILL. SO IJUST THINK THAT-

02:18:54.793 --> 02:18:56.161
MANDATING I THINK THAT EVERY

02:18:56.227 --> 02:18:57.295
EMPLOYER SHOULD DO EVERYTHING

02:18:57.362 --> 02:18:58.329
THEY CAN BASED ON WHAT WE

02:18:58.396 --> 02:18:59.531
LEARNED IN THIS PANDEMIC TO

02:18:59.597 --> 02:19:01.266
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. PROPER

02:19:01.332 --> 02:19:02.934
PP TO MAKE SURE OUR FRONTLINE

02:19:03.001 --> 02:19:05.103
WORKERS ARE TAKING CARE OF. BUT

02:19:05.170 --> 02:19:06.237
IF YOU NEED TO REALLY PUNISH

02:19:06.304 --> 02:19:09.441
ONE- FOR NOT SECURING. I

02:19:09.507 --> 02:19:10.742
BELIEVE IT WAS A THREE MINUTES

02:19:10.809 --> 02:19:12.377
OF EARTH. AS THREE MONTHS

02:19:12.444 --> 02:19:14.245
SUPPLY. AND A THREE MONTH

02:19:14.312 --> 02:19:16.915
SUPPLY. OF I THINK THAT'S JUST

02:19:16.981 --> 02:19:18.616
NOT SOMETHING THAT THAT WE CAN

02:19:18.683 --> 02:19:24.923
PUT ON OUR EMPLOYERS AT. THIS

02:19:24.989 --> 02:19:25.490
TIME BECAUSE LIKE I SAID. IN

02:19:25.557 --> 02:19:26.091
THE PAN IN THE BEGINNING MANY

02:19:26.157 --> 02:19:27.392
PEOPLE WERE. FOR THE PPP ITEMS.

02:19:27.459 --> 02:19:29.160
THE PRICES WERE SKYROCKETING

02:19:29.227 --> 02:19:30.361
THERE WAS NO CONTROL WE WERE

02:19:30.428 --> 02:19:31.196
GETTING EVERYTHING OUT OF

02:19:31.262 --> 02:19:33.631
CHINA. BECAUSE WE'VE DRIVEN ALL

02:19:33.698 --> 02:19:35.967
MANUFACTURING- YOU KNOW

02:19:36.034 --> 02:19:36.901
ESPECIALLY WITH THE HIGH COST

02:19:36.968 --> 02:19:38.036
OF DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE

02:19:38.103 --> 02:19:39.504
OF CALIFORNIA. A LOT OF THAT

02:19:39.571 --> 02:19:41.005
MANUFACTURING GOES TO OTHER

02:19:41.072 --> 02:19:42.607
STATES OR OTHER COUNTRIES.

02:19:42.674 --> 02:19:44.642
PRIMARILY CHINA. AND I JUST

02:19:44.709 --> 02:19:46.211
THINK THAT TO HAVE US RELY ON

02:19:46.277 --> 02:19:48.546
CHINA TO PROVIDE IS FOR PP. AT

02:19:48.613 --> 02:19:50.615
AN ADEQUATE COST AND HAVE OUR

02:19:50.682 --> 02:19:51.716
EMPLOYERS PUNISHED IF THEY

02:19:51.783 --> 02:19:53.518
CAN'T SECURE IT. IS NOT GOOD

RATA U. I. PAYMENT FOR THE ONE

02:28:32.236 --> 02:28:33.638
DAY PER WEEK OF AN EMPLOYMENT

02:28:33.704 --> 02:28:36.040
WHILE MAINTAINING. ANY EXISTING

02:28:36.107 --> 02:28:38.609
HEALTH AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS.

02:28:38.676 --> 02:28:42.146
WHARTON MEASURE ASTEROID WILL.

02:28:42.213 --> 02:28:44.815
THANK YOU ANY DISCUSSION OR

02:28:44.882 --> 02:28:47.251
DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. SHINO

02:28:47.318 --> 02:28:50.554
MIKE'S UP LOOKING REMOTELY

02:28:50.621 --> 02:28:54.125
SCENE NO YES WE DO. WE HAVE

02:28:54.191 --> 02:29:02.099
THIS IS SENATOR GROVE. SENATOR

02:29:02.166 --> 02:29:02.700
DID YOU WANT TO BE ON THE SIDE

02:29:02.767 --> 02:29:05.036
OF. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT

02:29:05.102 --> 02:29:07.605
QUESTIONED THE AUTHOR. WITH ALL

02:29:07.672 --> 02:29:09.440
THE THIRD QUESTION I WILL DO

02:29:09.507 --> 02:29:10.975
THAT YOUR SISTER WE ALL KNOW

02:29:11.042 --> 02:29:12.576
THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT THE YOU I

02:29:12.643 --> 02:29:14.979
TRUST FUND IS COMPLETELY

02:29:15.046 --> 02:29:18.649
UNDERFUNDED AND- THE LAST TIME

02:29:18.716 --> 02:29:19.283
THAT THIS HAPPENED EMPLOYERS IN

02:29:19.350 --> 02:29:19.984
THE STATE WHERE WERE

02:29:20.051 --> 02:29:22.219
ADDITIONALLY CAPPED AT. A TAX

02:29:22.286 --> 02:29:24.855
FOR THE TAX REDUCTION CREDIT-

02:29:24.922 --> 02:29:25.990
NOW WE HAVE THE PLAYERS IN A

02:29:26.057 --> 02:29:27.325
DIFFERENT SITUATION WHEN IT

02:29:27.391 --> 02:29:28.859
WASN'T THERE REESE IT WASN'T

02:29:28.926 --> 02:29:31.262
THEIR FAULT THAT- THE ECONOMIC

02:29:31.329 --> 02:29:33.197
SHUTDOWN TO PLACES WAS DIRECTED

02:29:33.264 --> 02:29:35.399
FROM THE GOVERNOR. SO THESE

02:29:35.466 --> 02:29:36.767
BUSINESSES THAT ARE OPERATING

02:29:36.834 --> 02:29:37.968
AT DIMINISHED CAPACITY OR

02:29:38.035 --> 02:29:41.739
MINIMAL CAPACITY AND- IT'S MORE

02:29:41.806 --> 02:29:43.908
THAN LIKELY THAT THEY WILL-

02:29:43.974 --> 02:29:45.142
THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO TAKE ON

02:29:45.209 --> 02:29:47.078
THE BURDEN AND THE AND THE

02:29:47.144 --> 02:29:49.980
UNINSURED AND EMPLOYMENT. TRUST

02:29:50.047 --> 02:29:50.781
TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THIS

02:29:50.848 --> 02:29:55.152
MONEY IS PAID OUT. AND REFUNDED

02:29:55.219 --> 02:29:57.254
AND THAT WILL HAPPEN FOR. I'M

02:29:57.321 --> 02:29:58.222
ASSUMING TEN TO TWELVE YEARS IN

02:29:58.289 --> 02:30:00.124
THE FUTURE SO I GUESS MY AND MY

02:30:00.191 --> 02:30:01.425
QUESTION IS THAT THERE WAS AN

02:30:01.492 --> 02:30:04.095
AMENDMENT THAT WAS TAKEN. IN

02:30:04.161 --> 02:30:06.731
THE ASSEMBLY WHICH ELIMINATED-

02:30:06.797 --> 02:30:09.467
YEAH THE ELIMINATED THE ABILITY

02:30:09.533 --> 02:30:11.502
TO- AD DOLLARS INTO THE U. I.

02:30:11.569 --> 02:30:13.237
TRIES TO ELIMINATE SOME OF THE

02:30:13.304 --> 02:30:13.838
STRAIN IT'S GOING TO BE

02:30:13.904 --> 02:30:15.373
HAPPENING ON FUTURE. IN THE

02:30:15.439 --> 02:30:16.640
FUTURE ON ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES

02:30:16.707 --> 02:30:18.509
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HE

02:30:18.576 --> 02:30:19.710
TELL ME WHY THAT A MINIMALISTIC

02:30:19.777 --> 02:30:23.781
SEPT. IT AND WHY WE WOULD EVEN

02:30:23.848 --> 02:30:24.582
TRY TO. BIRD BUSINESS THAT ARE

02:30:24.648 --> 02:30:25.783
EMPLOYERS ANYMORE THAN THEY

02:30:25.850 --> 02:30:29.253
ALREADY ARE. HAPPY TO. BE

02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:30.955
CHALLENGED AT ALL OF US FACED

02:30:31.021 --> 02:30:32.723
IN THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN

02:30:32.790 --> 02:30:35.059
HERE WAS TO TRY TO REDUCE AS

02:30:35.126 --> 02:30:36.594
MUCH BURDEN AS POSSIBLE ON THE

02:30:36.660 --> 02:30:39.397
GENERAL FUND. THE FRAMEWORK WAS

02:30:39.463 --> 02:30:42.767
HOW DO WE KEEP PEOPLE WORKING

02:30:42.833 --> 02:30:43.300
CREATE THE MOST AMOUNT OF

02:30:43.367 --> 02:30:44.635
ECONOMIC IMPACT FOR FOLKS. THE

02:30:44.702 --> 02:30:46.570
MONEY YOU TALK ABOUT IS A IT IS

02:30:46.637 --> 02:30:48.472
AT THIS POINT A NO INTEREST

02:30:48.539 --> 02:30:50.007
LOAN. BUT TO THE STATE OF

02:30:50.074 --> 02:30:52.009
CALIFORNIA IT'S LIKE A LINE OF

02:30:52.076 --> 02:30:53.978
CREDIT. SO HERE WE ARE HAVING

02:30:54.044 --> 02:30:55.012
THE BENEFIT OF THESE

02:30:55.079 --> 02:30:56.380
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS OF COURSE

02:30:56.447 --> 02:30:57.748
IT WILL ULTIMATELY BE A BURDEN

02:30:57.815 --> 02:30:59.650
ON EMPLOYERS BUT IT'S A NO

02:30:59.717 --> 02:31:01.018
INTEREST LOAN THAT BASICALLY

02:31:01.085 --> 02:31:02.853
TAKES CARE OF PEOPLE ALLOWS

02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:04.321
PEOPLE TO BUY FOOD PAY THE RENT

02:31:04.388 --> 02:31:06.323
AND THE LIKE. SO BY ORDERS OF

02:31:06.390 --> 02:31:07.992
MAGNITUDE WHEN THE SITUATION

02:31:08.058 --> 02:31:09.460
THAT IS QUITE CHALLENGING THAT

02:31:09.527 --> 02:31:10.394
YOU'RE CORRECT IS NO ONE'S

02:31:10.461 --> 02:31:12.863
FAULT. WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE IN

02:31:12.930 --> 02:31:13.831
WHAT WHY I THINK THIS MEASURE

02:31:13.898 --> 02:31:16.233
SO ELEGANT IT'S BECAUSE ON THE

02:31:16.300 --> 02:31:18.702
ONE HAND. ARM WE CAN'T AFFORD

02:31:18.769 --> 02:31:19.837
TO KEEP PUTTING A HUGE BURDEN

02:31:19.904 --> 02:31:20.871
ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S

02:31:20.938 --> 02:31:22.406
GENERAL FUND THAT WOULD BE

02:31:22.473 --> 02:31:24.208
PROBLEMATIC. WE HAVE A NO

02:31:24.275 --> 02:31:25.776
INTEREST LOAN FOR A PERIOD OF

02:31:25.843 --> 02:31:26.610
TIME NOW FROM THE FEDERAL

02:31:26.677 --> 02:31:28.712
GOVERNMENT. AND THEN ALSO WE

02:31:28.779 --> 02:31:30.514
HAVE THIS ODD SITUATION WITH

02:31:30.581 --> 02:31:33.217
THIS WORK SHARE PROGRAM WHERE

02:31:33.284 --> 02:31:33.818
PEOPLE WANT TO WORK IF YOU'RE

02:31:33.884 --> 02:31:35.219
AN EMPLOYER YOU WILL BE GOT A

02:31:35.286 --> 02:31:36.854
REALLY GOOD EMPLOYEE YOU DON'T

02:31:36.921 --> 02:31:38.189
WANT TO JUST BE A SITUATION ARE

02:31:38.255 --> 02:31:39.290
INCENTIVIZED TO GO ON AN

02:31:39.356 --> 02:31:41.192
EMPLOYMENT. AND THIS MEETS A

02:31:41.258 --> 02:31:42.693
REALLY ELEGANT BALANCE IN THAT

02:31:42.760 --> 02:31:44.829
REGARD GIVEN ALL OF THESE VERY

02:31:44.895 --> 02:31:46.497
SERIOUS CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE

02:31:46.564 --> 02:31:48.499
FACING IN THE ECONOMY GOING

02:31:48.566 --> 02:31:49.467
FORWARD. AND WE DON'T KNOW FOR

02:31:49.533 --> 02:31:50.835
THE BEGINNING MIDDLE OR END OF

02:31:50.901 --> 02:31:53.170
THE CIRCUMSTANCES WE ARE SO. IT

02:31:53.237 --> 02:31:55.372
IS CHALLENGING BUT IT IS AND IT

02:31:55.439 --> 02:31:56.407
WILL HAVE PROBLEMS IN THE

02:31:56.474 --> 02:31:57.641
FUTURE THERE'S NO QUESTION

02:31:57.708 --> 02:31:58.542
THEY'LL BE CHALLENGES AS WE GO

02:31:58.609 --> 02:32:00.411
FORWARD. BUT RIGHT NOW WE'VE

02:32:00.478 --> 02:32:01.645
GOT TO KEEP FOOD ON THE TABLE

02:32:01.712 --> 02:32:04.315
KEEP KIND PLAYERS- HAVING-

02:32:04.381 --> 02:32:05.916
THEIR EMPLOYEES WORKING AND

02:32:05.983 --> 02:32:06.951
HAVING THEIR BENEFITS SO I

02:32:07.017 --> 02:32:10.788
THINK IT'S. A PRETTY THOUGHTFUL

02:32:10.855 --> 02:32:11.856
APPROACH BY THE AUTHOR. THANK

02:32:11.922 --> 02:32:13.324
YOU FOR THE RESPONSE I WOULD

02:32:13.390 --> 02:32:15.226
ADAM ACTUALLY URGE A NO VOTE

02:32:15.292 --> 02:32:16.594
FOR THE PREVIOUS REASONS I

02:32:16.660 --> 02:32:19.129
THINK THAT- I DO AGREE THAT

02:32:19.196 --> 02:32:20.965
IT'S LIKE A NO INTEREST LOAN

02:32:21.031 --> 02:32:22.132
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

02:32:22.199 --> 02:32:23.701
BUT LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED

02:32:23.767 --> 02:32:24.668
WHEN WE HAD AN ECONOMIC

02:32:24.735 --> 02:32:26.470
DOWNTURN. AND THE STATE OF

02:32:26.537 --> 02:32:29.340
CALIFORNIA DEFAULTED ON THAT ON

02:32:29.406 --> 02:32:31.775
LOAN AND NEVER PAID A DIME-

02:32:31.842 --> 02:32:33.711
BACK FROM THE GENERAL FUND- SO

02:32:33.777 --> 02:32:36.814
THE- EMPLOYERS WERE TAXED. AT A

02:32:36.881 --> 02:32:38.549
GREATER AMOUNT AND IF THE TAX

02:32:38.616 --> 02:32:39.683
REDUCTION CREDIT WHICH WAS

02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:41.051
ELIMINATED BY THE FEDERAL

02:32:41.118 --> 02:32:42.553
GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THE STATE OF

02:32:42.620 --> 02:32:44.021
CALIFORNIA FAILED TO PAY THAT

02:32:44.088 --> 02:32:45.689
LOAN BACK. SO IT'S STILL ON THE

02:32:45.756 --> 02:32:47.825
BACKS OF EVERY JOB CREATOR. AS

02:32:47.892 --> 02:32:49.126
SOME BUSINESSES WENT OUT OF

02:32:49.193 --> 02:32:50.594
BUSINESS BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH AN

02:32:50.661 --> 02:32:52.630
EXTRAORDINARY BURDEN. AT TO

02:32:52.696 --> 02:32:54.598
MAINTAIN I BELIEVE FOR SIX

02:32:54.665 --> 02:32:57.268
YEARS AND- WE DID ESTIMATE TO

02:32:57.334 --> 02:32:58.102
SHOW THAT THIS WILL PROBABLY

02:32:58.168 --> 02:33:00.204
LAST LONGER TAN FIFTEEN YEARS.

02:33:00.271 --> 02:33:01.772
I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT

02:33:01.839 --> 02:33:02.740
OF THE PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESS

02:33:02.806 --> 02:33:03.707
COMMUNITY GATHER SUPPORTING

02:33:03.774 --> 02:33:05.609
THIS BILL BECAUSE- IT IS.

02:33:05.676 --> 02:33:07.144
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

02:33:07.211 --> 02:33:08.879
TO OFFER IT TO SEE IF OTHER

02:33:08.946 --> 02:33:10.114
EMPLOYEES WOULD BE WILLING TO.

02:33:10.180 --> 02:33:11.715
YOU KNOW SHARE THE BURDEN OF

02:33:11.782 --> 02:33:13.551
SOMEBODY LOSING THEIR JOB. I'M

02:33:13.617 --> 02:33:14.852
SO I SEE THE IMPACT THAT I JUST

02:33:14.919 --> 02:33:17.821
DON'T SEE. THAT YOU CAN- DO

02:33:17.888 --> 02:33:19.189
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND NOT

02:33:19.256 --> 02:33:21.559
ADDRESS THE SEVERE. GET THIS

02:33:21.625 --> 02:33:24.528
SEVERE- REJECTION IN THAT YOU I

02:33:24.595 --> 02:33:26.063
TRUST FUND. BECAUSE THAT'S

02:33:26.130 --> 02:33:30.301
GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT.

02:33:30.367 --> 02:33:30.901
SHORTFALL THAT'S GOING TO HAVE

02:33:30.968 --> 02:33:31.502
TO BE MADE AT. AT SO AGAIN I

02:33:31.569 --> 02:33:33.604
WOULD AS ABSOLUTELY ASK FREE

02:33:33.671 --> 02:33:36.674
AND NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR

02:33:36.740 --> 02:33:42.513
MELINDA. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT

02:33:42.580 --> 02:33:46.317
RIGHT. YOU KNOW GET THE IDEA

02:33:46.383 --> 02:33:48.919
BEHIND THIS BILL I LAKE THE

02:33:48.986 --> 02:33:51.689
PROBLEM IS IT THE APPROVAL OF

02:33:51.755 --> 02:33:54.692
THESE PLANS- GO TO THE DIRECTOR

02:33:54.758 --> 02:33:56.627
B. D. D. AND WE KNOW THAT EDIE

02:33:56.694 --> 02:33:59.563
D. HAS HAD A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS

02:33:59.630 --> 02:34:01.131
KEEPING UP WITH THEIR WORKLOAD

02:34:01.198 --> 02:34:02.399
RECENTLY TO THE POINT WHERE THE

02:34:02.466 --> 02:34:03.867
MOST RECENT ARTICLE I SAW SAID

02:34:03.934 --> 02:34:07.771
THAT EDT WISE NOT ANSWERING 60%

02:34:07.838 --> 02:34:08.339
OF THE CALLS THAT THEY WERE

02:34:08.405 --> 02:34:10.474
RECEIVING. SO I HAVE SOME

02:34:10.541 --> 02:34:12.876
CONCERNS ABOUT JUST THEM BEING

02:34:12.943 --> 02:34:16.947
ABLE TO TAKE ON MORE TASKS- I

02:34:17.014 --> 02:34:18.782
WONDER IF THE AUTHOR OR THE

02:34:18.849 --> 02:34:21.819
FLOOR MANAGER COULD- ADDRESS

02:34:21.885 --> 02:34:25.055
THAT PLEASE. I'LL JUST MY

02:34:25.122 --> 02:34:26.256

02:34:26.323 --> 02:34:34.131
CLOSER- MELINDA'S. ZERO DOLLARS.

THANK YOU THE BUT MR PRESIDENT

THAT REAL QUICK I JUST WANNA

02:34:37.968 --> 02:34:39.303
MAKE A COMMENT I HAPPEN TO BE

02:34:39.370 --> 02:34:40.537
ONE OF THOSE EMPLOYERS THAT

02:34:40.604 --> 02:34:43.273
ACTUALLY. ADD TO PAY BACK IN

02:34:43.340 --> 02:34:44.975
THE UNDER THE LAST RECESSION WE

02:34:45.042 --> 02:34:46.944
HAD AND IT WAS IT WAS FROM THE

02:34:47.011 --> 02:34:48.545
TWO THOUSAND A RECESSION. THAT

02:34:48.612 --> 02:34:49.313
WE'VE ALL THE MONEY FROM THE

02:34:49.380 --> 02:34:50.047
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JUST LIKE

02:34:50.114 --> 02:34:51.382
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- THE

02:34:51.448 --> 02:34:53.817
JOCKEY THIS BILL AND YOU KNOW

02:34:53.884 --> 02:34:55.386
THOSE EMPLOYERS HAD TO PAY THAT

02:34:55.452 --> 02:34:58.122
BACK WE JUST GOT IT PAID OFF- I

02:34:58.188 --> 02:34:58.922
THINK IT WAS LIKE TWO THOUSAND

02:34:58.989 --> 02:35:02.026
EIGHTEEN. OR SEVENTEEN AND NOW

02:35:02.092 --> 02:35:03.327
HERE WE ARE AGAIN GOING RIGHT

02:35:03.394 --> 02:35:04.595

THIS BILL A LOT I ACTUALLY WANT

02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:08.565
TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL AND IT

02:35:08.632 --> 02:35:09.833
WAS. IN GOOD SHAPE UNTIL IT

02:35:09.900 --> 02:35:13.103
CAME BACK WITH THE- PUTTING

02:35:13.170 --> 02:35:13.570

GONE. AND THERE'S A LOT OF

02:35:21.412 --> 02:35:22.613
REASONS THAT IS MAKING IT VERY

02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:23.480
DIFFICULT IF YOU HAVE NO

BUSINESS YOU HAVE NO EMPLOYEES.

02:35:24.882 --> 02:35:26.650
WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE NO JOB.

02:35:26.717 --> 02:35:28.252
THE IDEA OF DOING A PARTIAL IS

02:35:28.318 --> 02:35:30.521
GREAT BUT WHEN IT GOES BACK ON

02:35:30.587 --> 02:35:32.890

02:35:34.458 --> 02:35:35.259
AMAZING TO ME THAT WE CAN

02:35:35.325 --> 02:35:36.593
NEVER. LOOK OUT FOR THE

02:35:36.660 --> 02:35:37.928

02:35:38.862 --> 02:35:40.030

THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL.

02:35:51.775 --> 02:35:52.276

02:35:58.215 --> 02:36:01.185
VERY BRIEFLY I YOU KNOW I THINK

02:36:01.251 --> 02:36:03.253
THE AUTHOR IS SENSITIVE TO THE

02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:05.355
ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED. THIS

02:36:05.422 --> 02:36:07.091
GOVERNMENT TO GET IT CORRECT

02:36:07.157 --> 02:36:10.527
TAKE TEN YEARS ROM TWO

02:36:10.594 --> 02:36:11.095

02:36:11.161 --> 02:36:11.695
EIGHTEEN TO PAY OFF THE LAST

02:36:11.762 --> 02:36:14.264
SUM OF MONEY. I THINK THAT I

02:36:14.331 --> 02:36:14.698
THINK THAT THERE'S A

02:36:14.765 --> 02:36:17.401
POSSIBILITY GOING FORWARD AND

02:36:17.468 --> 02:36:18.802
CERTAINLY HAS US IN THE

02:36:18.869 --> 02:36:21.338
LEGISLATURE TO PRIORITIZE WITH

02:36:21.405 --> 02:36:22.272
RESPECT TO PARTICULAR SMALL

02:36:22.339 --> 02:36:24.141
BUSINESSES. TO BE ABLE TO MAYBE

02:36:24.208 --> 02:36:25.375
HAVE THE STATE STEP UP OR THERE

02:36:25.442 --> 02:36:26.944
COULD BE SOME OTHER ADAPTIVE

02:36:27.010 --> 02:36:29.146
APPROACHES BUT RIGHT NOW IN

02:36:29.213 --> 02:36:30.681
TERMS OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY

02:36:30.748 --> 02:36:32.015
REMAINS VERY DIFFICULT

02:36:32.082 --> 02:36:33.851

02:36:33.917 --> 02:36:35.853
INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO SAY OH

02:36:35.919 --> 02:36:37.054
I'M GOING TO JUST STAND ON

02:36:37.121 --> 02:36:38.655

02:36:38.722 --> 02:36:40.991

02:36:41.058 --> 02:36:42.926
AND HELPS EMPLOYERS TO KEEP

02:36:42.993 --> 02:36:45.062

02:36:45.129 --> 02:36:46.196
AGREE THAT THERE MIGHT BE

02:36:46.263 --> 02:36:48.065
CHALLENGED IN THE FUTURE. WE

02:36:48.132 --> 02:36:50.167
ARE IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION

02:36:50.234 --> 02:36:51.835

02:36:51.902 --> 02:36:53.771
NEAR TERM. AND WE LEAVE OPEN

02:36:53.837 --> 02:36:55.339
FOR DEBATE GOING FORWARD IF WE

02:36:55.405 --> 02:36:57.307
WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME

02:36:57.374 --> 02:36:59.109
SUBSIDY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES

02:36:59.176 --> 02:37:00.077
AND IMPACT THOSE QUESTIONS AS

02:37:00.144 --> 02:37:01.879
WE MOVE FORWARD. TO ANALYZE

02:37:01.945 --> 02:37:03.447
WHAT RESOURCES THE STATES HAVE

02:37:03.514 --> 02:37:05.415
WHAT PRIORITY THE STATE HAS SO

02:37:05.482 --> 02:37:06.950
IT'S IMPORTANT POINT BUT I

02:37:07.017 --> 02:37:08.552

02:37:08.619 --> 02:37:11.488

DON'T KNOW HOW AN EMPLOYER

04:13:15.647 --> 04:13:17.348
WOULD COMPLY WITH THAT IF

04:13:17.415 --> 04:13:18.683

DIDN'T SELF IDENTIFY YOURSELF

04:13:24.589 --> 04:13:26.324

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH OSHA WITH

04:13:40.338 --> 04:13:41.673
YOUR STORY TO WALK INTO A

04:13:41.739 --> 04:13:43.207
BUSINESS IS BUSINESS AND

04:13:43.274 --> 04:13:45.977
BASICALLY JUST SHUT THEM DOWN-

04:13:46.044 --> 04:13:47.312
WITHOUT ANY DUE PROCESS AND

04:13:47.378 --> 04:13:48.947
THAT'S COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.

04:13:49.013 --> 04:13:50.315
DOZENS OF ASSOCIATIONS ARE

04:13:50.381 --> 04:13:51.950
OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE AND FOR

04:13:52.016 --> 04:13:53.651
GOOD REASON I ACTUALLY CONSIDER

04:13:53.718 --> 04:13:55.186
THE SEVERE RAMIFICATIONS A

04:13:55.253 --> 04:13:57.388
STILL HAVE- INUSE YOUR LOGIC

04:13:57.455 --> 04:13:59.257
INTO DENYING THIS PREMATURE

04:13:59.324 --> 04:14:02.093
BILL AGAIN- I DON'T KNOW HOW

04:14:02.160 --> 04:14:03.361
ANY EMPLOYER IS GOING TO BE

04:14:03.428 --> 04:14:07.098
ABLE TO IDENTIFY AND REPORT AN

04:14:07.165 --> 04:14:09.000

FAMILY GATHERING OR OUTSIDE THE

04:14:12.604 --> 04:14:14.038

RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR A NO VOTE.

04:14:20.378 --> 04:14:20.945
THANK YOU ANY FURTHER THIS. OR

04:14:21.012 --> 04:14:22.580
DEBATE ON THIS. WE HAVE.

04:14:22.647 --> 04:14:30.088
SENATOR BORDERS. THANK YOU MY

04:14:30.154 --> 04:14:32.423
COLLEAGUE MENTIONED SOMETHING

04:14:32.490 --> 04:14:34.792
THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT. THAT

04:14:34.859 --> 04:14:36.461
THIS BILL DOES NOT APPEAR TO

04:14:36.527 --> 04:14:38.763
ADDRESS IS WHETHER OR NOT THERE

04:14:38.830 --> 04:14:41.633
IS A REQUIREMENT THAT THE

04:14:41.699 --> 04:14:44.068
EMPLOYEES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO

04:14:44.135 --> 04:14:46.771
DISCLOSE. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE

04:14:46.838 --> 04:14:48.640
WAY THAT I UNDERSTAND IT. THE

04:14:48.706 --> 04:14:50.675
ENTIRE ONUS IS ON THE BUSINESS

04:14:50.742 --> 04:14:52.910
OWNER BUT THAT BUSINESS OWNER

04:14:52.977 --> 04:14:55.413
DOES NOT HAVE FULL ACCESS. TO

04:14:55.480 --> 04:14:57.081
INFORMATION IN THE EMPLOYEE

04:14:57.148 --> 04:14:59.917
HOUSEHOLD IN FRANKLIN I IMAGINE

04:14:59.984 --> 04:15:02.854
THERE'S SOME PRIVACY EFFORTS.

04:15:02.920 --> 04:15:05.256
AND PROTECTIONS IN PLACE THAT

04:15:05.323 --> 04:15:07.125
MAY ACTUALLY KEEP THE EMPLOYEE

04:15:07.191 --> 04:15:09.260
FROM HAVING TO DISCLOSE. SO

04:15:09.327 --> 04:15:10.728
THAT'S ISSUE NUMBER ONE IS THAT

04:15:10.795 --> 04:15:12.664
THIS IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY

04:15:12.730 --> 04:15:14.866
TAILORED AND REFINED. INTO A

04:15:14.932 --> 04:15:17.368
WORKABLE FORM THE SECOND IS

04:15:17.435 --> 04:15:19.804
THAT IT IS AN AUTHORIZATION

04:15:19.871 --> 04:15:22.106
UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE. BUT

04:15:22.173 --> 04:15:23.675
THE ENTIRE FOCUS OF THE

04:15:23.741 --> 04:15:26.110
LEGISLATION IS WITHIN THE

04:15:26.177 --> 04:15:28.713
CONTEXT OF CODE. WE DON'T KNOW

04:15:28.780 --> 04:15:30.314
IF KOBE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO

04:15:30.381 --> 04:15:34.485
BE THE THREAT IN TWENTY TWENTY

04:15:34.552 --> 04:15:36.087
TO TWENTY THREE AS IT IS TODAY.

04:15:36.154 --> 04:15:38.256

IT WOULD BE REFINED TO THE

04:15:40.124 --> 04:15:41.259

04:15:43.861 --> 04:15:46.798
AUTHORIZATIONS INVOLVING KOBE.

04:15:46.864 --> 04:15:49.067
SO I GUESS IN SHORT. I WANT TO

04:15:49.133 --> 04:15:50.935
MAKE CERTAIN THAT BUSINESSES

04:15:51.002 --> 04:15:54.839

04:15:54.906 --> 04:15:55.506

IN SACRAMENTO AS WELL. THEY ARE

AN OPTION FOR CALIFORNIANS IN

CITIES THESE DEVICES HAVE

04:27:33.837 --> 04:27:36.540
APPEARED OFTEN OVER NIGHT. AND

04:27:36.607 --> 04:27:38.041
DAY LEAVE CITIES AND COUNTIES

04:27:38.108 --> 04:27:40.511
TO CREATE POLICIES AROUND THE

04:27:40.577 --> 04:27:42.880
ISSUE WITHOUT ANY FRAMEWORK AND

04:27:42.946 --> 04:27:44.882
HOW TO DEAL WITH THESE MOBILITY

04:27:44.948 --> 04:27:46.850
DEVICES OF COURSE THERE ARE

04:27:46.917 --> 04:27:48.786
PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS FOR

WRITERS AS WELL AS THE USERS OF

04:27:50.821 --> 04:27:52.856
THE BIKES. THIS MEASURE CREATES

04:27:52.923 --> 04:27:55.559
A STATEWIDE MINIMUM STANDARD

04:27:55.626 --> 04:27:57.461
REQUIRED FOR SHARED MOBILITY

04:27:57.528 --> 04:27:59.596
DEVICES WITH THE REQUIREMENT

04:27:59.663 --> 04:28:01.632
THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES ADOPT

AND COMPLY WITH SAFETY RULES

04:28:03.834 --> 04:28:04.902
AND THAT THERE BE MINIMUM

04:28:04.968 --> 04:28:07.971
INSURANCE OR I SHOULD SAY

04:28:08.038 --> 04:28:09.406
MINIMUM INSURANCE. IN ORDER TO

04:28:09.473 --> 04:28:10.240
PROTECT RIDERS FROM THIRD

04:28:10.307 --> 04:28:12.276
PARTIES RECENT AMENDMENTS

04:28:12.342 --> 04:28:14.478
SADLY. REMOVE THE WAIVER

04:28:14.545 --> 04:28:17.247
PROVISION. THAT HAS ALLOWED

04:28:17.314 --> 04:28:19.716
COMPANIES TO REQUIRE THAT

04:28:19.783 --> 04:28:22.186
RIDERS WAVE A LIABILITY OF

04:28:22.252 --> 04:28:24.121
THESE COMPANIES. BUT BY

04:28:24.188 --> 04:28:27.291
REMOVING THAT. THE INDUSTRY HEN

04:28:27.357 --> 04:28:29.960
ALL OPPONENTS AS I UNDERSTAND

04:28:30.027 --> 04:28:31.094
IT HAVE REMOVED THEIR

04:28:31.161 --> 04:28:33.163
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL SO IT IS

04:28:33.230 --> 04:28:34.965
NOT QUITE THE BILL I HAD HOPED

04:28:35.032 --> 04:28:36.500
BUT IT DOES REQUIRE THAT WE

04:28:36.567 --> 04:28:38.802
START ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE AND

04:28:38.869 --> 04:28:40.504
THESE PIPES ARE THESE BIKES AND

04:28:40.571 --> 04:28:42.739
MOBILITY DEVICES- TO AT LEAST

04:28:42.806 --> 04:28:44.675
CREATE A BASIC FRAMEWORK FOR

04:28:44.741 --> 04:28:47.878
THEIR USE AND WITH THAT I WOULD

04:28:47.945 --> 04:28:48.445
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I.

04:28:48.512 --> 04:28:53.016
VOTE. ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION

04:28:53.083 --> 04:28:56.687
OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. I SEE

04:28:56.753 --> 04:29:00.491
NO HANDS HERE. REMOTELY WE HAVE

04:29:00.557 --> 04:29:09.666
SENATOR GORGEOUS. THANK YOU.

04:29:09.733 --> 04:29:11.368
WHEN THIS MATTER CAME TO

04:29:11.435 --> 04:29:14.204
JUDICIARY I THINK MOST OF THE

04:29:14.271 --> 04:29:16.006
AREAS OF DISCUSSION WERE ALL ON

04:29:16.073 --> 04:29:18.742
THE WAIVER- I HAD HEARTBURN

04:29:18.809 --> 04:29:22.112
UPON THAT- AND WE GOT OURSELVES

04:29:22.179 --> 04:29:25.649
BACK AND FORTH ON. A NEW ONCE

04:29:25.716 --> 04:29:28.285
LEGAL MATTER BUT ALL ULTIMATELY

04:29:28.352 --> 04:29:31.021
EVERYONE AGREED THAT YOU CANNOT

04:29:31.088 --> 04:29:32.856
WAIVE THROUGH A LEGAL

04:29:32.923 --> 04:29:34.791
INSTRUMENT MANUFACTURER

04:29:34.858 --> 04:29:37.327
LIABILITY. SO THAT THERE WERE

04:29:37.394 --> 04:29:40.130
OTHER REASONS WHY A WAIVER WAS

04:29:40.197 --> 04:29:42.533
SOUGHT IN ANOTHER REASON WHY

04:29:42.599 --> 04:29:45.903
WEAVER. THERE IS A DESIRE TO

04:29:45.969 --> 04:29:47.771
REMOVE THE WAIVER FROM THE

04:29:47.838 --> 04:29:50.474
TRANSACTION BUT AS IT TURNS OUT

04:29:50.541 --> 04:29:54.011
NOW THIS BILL HAS JUST BECOME A

04:29:54.077 --> 04:29:56.013
MINIMUM INSURANCE COVERAGE- A

04:29:56.079 --> 04:29:58.882
LOT OF POLICY ON THE SCOOTER

04:29:58.949 --> 04:30:01.051
COMPANIES SO MY FORMER

04:30:01.118 --> 04:30:03.720
OPPOSITION WAS BECAUSE OF THE

04:30:03.787 --> 04:30:05.923
WAIVER AND IN ITS CURRENT FORM

04:30:05.989 --> 04:30:06.857
I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY

04:30:06.924 --> 04:30:10.494
SUPPORTABLE. AND IT'S CLEAR

04:30:10.561 --> 04:30:11.828
THAT THE OPPOSITION THAT

04:30:11.895 --> 04:30:14.064
EXISTED BEFORE AS EITHER

04:30:14.131 --> 04:30:18.035
REMOVED OR GONE NEUTRAL SO.

04:30:18.101 --> 04:30:19.503

04:30:31.848 --> 04:30:34.651
CONCERNED WHEN WE ADDRESS NEW

04:30:34.718 --> 04:30:36.153
TECHNOLOGIES OF THIS NATURE ACT

04:30:36.219 --> 04:30:38.288
SOME MEMBER TAKING MY OLDEST

04:30:38.355 --> 04:30:39.590
SON WHEN HE WAS TEN YEARS OLD

04:30:39.656 --> 04:30:42.092
TO THE BASE OF HALF DOME AND

04:30:42.159 --> 04:30:43.727
LOOK AT THE CABLE AND- I SAID

04:30:43.794 --> 04:30:44.628
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE

04:30:44.695 --> 04:30:46.530
TO GO TO THE TOP AND HE SAID NO

04:30:46.597 --> 04:30:48.665
DAD WE'RE NOT GOING BECAUSE-

04:30:48.732 --> 04:30:51.068
AND SO. WE GET. BETTER BUT WE

04:30:51.134 --> 04:30:52.336
ALL KNOW THAT WHEN WE DO

04:30:52.402 --> 04:30:54.271
CERTAIN THINGS- BECAUSE FANS

04:30:54.338 --> 04:30:55.405
ARE ACTIVITIES ARE GONNA BE

04:30:55.472 --> 04:30:57.174
SOME. ELEMENT OF RISK IN IT AND

04:30:57.240 --> 04:30:58.675
IT SHOULD BE ON US IF WE'RE

04:30:58.742 --> 04:31:01.411
GOING TO. GET ON A SCOOTER OR-

04:31:01.478 --> 04:31:02.879

THAT WE ARE TAKING CERTAIN

04:31:04.247 --> 04:31:05.549
RISKS I JUST THINK WE NEED TO

04:31:05.616 --> 04:31:07.985
BE REAL CAUTIOUS. WHEN WE TAKE

04:31:08.051 --> 04:31:09.553

YES I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THIS

04:31:37.014 --> 04:31:38.482
ISN'T JUST ABOUT MINIMUM

04:31:38.548 --> 04:31:40.517

04:31:40.584 --> 04:31:42.252
COMMUNITIES TO ADDRESS THE FACT

04:31:42.319 --> 04:31:44.154
THAT THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY IS

04:31:44.221 --> 04:31:46.189
HERE AND THAT IT DOES-

04:31:46.256 --> 04:31:47.958
POTENTIALLY SERVE A VERY

04:31:48.025 --> 04:31:49.760
POSITIVE PURPOSE WHEN IT COMES

04:31:49.826 --> 04:31:51.528
TO TRANSPORTATION BUT IT ALSO

04:31:51.595 --> 04:31:54.431

04:31:54.498 --> 04:31:57.868

FROM THE POLICE NOT BECAUSE

04:44:15.304 --> 04:44:17.240
THEY COMMITTED ANY CRIME.

04:44:17.306 --> 04:44:19.041
BECAUSE THEY FEAR THE POLICE

04:44:19.108 --> 04:44:20.476
AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE

04:44:20.543 --> 04:44:21.944
LAST SIX MONTHS WHAT WE'VE SEEN

04:44:22.011 --> 04:44:24.280
OVER MY LIFETIME IF THAT WOULD

04:44:24.347 --> 04:44:26.416
HAPPEN TO YOU. YOU WOULD FEAR

04:44:26.482 --> 04:44:28.050
THE POLICE TOO BUT IT DOESN'T

04:44:28.117 --> 04:44:29.619
HAPPEN TO WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS

04:44:29.685 --> 04:44:32.321
SO TO HAVE A METHOD. OF

04:44:32.388 --> 04:44:34.090
INVESTIGATING. LAW ENFORCEMENT

04:44:34.157 --> 04:44:35.558
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE KILLED

04:44:35.625 --> 04:44:38.294
UNARMED. CITIZENS REGARDLESS OF

04:44:38.361 --> 04:44:39.729
THEIR COLOR SHOULD BE COMMON

04:44:39.796 --> 04:44:41.030
SENSE AND WE SHOULD ALL

04:44:41.097 --> 04:44:43.466
SUPPORT. I HAVE A FAMILY THAT'S

04:44:43.533 --> 04:44:45.134
BEEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AS I

04:44:45.201 --> 04:44:46.869
TOLD THE STORY I CAME CLOSE TO

04:44:46.936 --> 04:44:48.438
BEING A POLICE OFFICER I HAVE A

04:44:48.504 --> 04:44:51.007
FRIEND FROM. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL

04:44:51.073 --> 04:44:52.575
WAY TO COLLEGE. WHO JUST

04:44:52.642 --> 04:44:54.510
RETIRED FROM THIRTY FIVE YEARS

04:44:54.577 --> 04:44:57.380
AS AN LAPD OFFICER AT THIRTY

04:44:57.447 --> 04:44:58.448
FIVE YEARS HE NEVER ONCE FIRED

04:44:58.514 --> 04:45:00.516
HIS WEAPON BUT HE TOLD ME MANY

04:45:00.583 --> 04:45:02.018
OF THE STORIES OF THE FACT

04:45:02.084 --> 04:45:03.686
THAT. HE KNEW WHEN ONE OF HIS

04:45:03.753 --> 04:45:05.388
PARTNERS WAS GOING TO FIRE HIS

04:45:05.455 --> 04:45:07.890
WEAPON BECAUSE IT WAS A BLACK

04:45:07.957 --> 04:45:08.391
OR BROWN PERSON AND THEY

04:45:08.458 --> 04:45:09.725
AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME THAT THEY

04:45:09.792 --> 04:45:11.060
WERE FROM. SO THEY HAVE A

04:45:11.127 --> 04:45:13.095
METHOD TO INVESTIGATE POLICE

04:45:13.162 --> 04:45:14.931
OFFICERS THIS IS COMMON SENSE

04:45:14.997 --> 04:45:16.399
THIS IS ACTUALLY SUPPORTS

04:45:16.466 --> 04:45:18.134

04:45:32.381 --> 04:45:34.851
METHOD IN WHICH TO INVESTIGATE

04:45:34.917 --> 04:45:37.053
THOSE SHOOTINGS BECAUSE- IF

04:45:37.119 --> 04:45:38.454
YOU'RE NOT APPALLED AT WHAT WE

04:45:38.521 --> 04:45:40.389

BECAUSE THE CONTINUE TO SAY

04:45:58.374 --> 04:46:00.176
THAT JUSTICE IS COLOR BLIND IS

04:46:00.243 --> 04:46:02.778
THE BIGGEST LIE WE TELL IN THIS

04:46:02.845 --> 04:46:04.780

04:46:04.847 --> 04:46:06.482

STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL

04:46:37.513 --> 04:46:38.848
WE HEARD IT IN OUR PUBLIC

04:46:38.915 --> 04:46:41.984
SAFETY COMMITTEE. THE TESTIMONY

04:46:42.051 --> 04:46:43.753
WAS THOROUGH THE DISCUSSION IN

04:46:43.819 --> 04:46:46.022
THE ANALYSIS WAS THOROUGH. AND

04:46:46.088 --> 04:46:47.356
I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WHILE I

04:46:47.423 --> 04:46:48.991
DO NOT HAVE THE EXACT

04:46:49.058 --> 04:46:51.427
STATISTICS FOR CALIFORNIA. WE

04:46:51.494 --> 04:46:52.361
ARE AVERAGING IN THE UNITED

04:46:52.428 --> 04:46:55.264
STATES OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE

04:46:55.331 --> 04:46:57.400
FATALLY SHOT BY POLICE ANNUALLY.

04:46:57.466 --> 04:47:00.202
AND OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

04:47:00.269 --> 04:47:04.840
YEARS. ONLY FOUR HUNDRED

04:47:04.907 --> 04:47:07.009
OFFICERS WERE CHARGED AND

04:47:07.076 --> 04:47:09.078
THAT'S AFTER THAT'S A THOUSAND

04:47:09.145 --> 04:47:11.514
A YEAR OF DEATHS. GET OVER

04:47:11.581 --> 04:47:14.317

ONE HUNDRED OFFICERS HAVE BEEN

04:47:15.017 --> 04:47:17.954
CHARGED. AND ONLY FORTY TWO

04:47:18.020 --> 04:47:19.822
HAVE BEEN CONVICTED AND THAT'S

04:47:19.889 --> 04:47:23.326
ACROSS THE US IN CALIFORNIA.

04:47:23.392 --> 04:47:25.828
AND EVEN FEWER. NOW I AM NOT

04:47:25.895 --> 04:47:27.997
NECESSARILY ARGUING THAT

04:47:28.064 --> 04:47:30.766
OFFICERS BE CONVICTED. WHAT I

04:47:30.833 --> 04:47:33.970
AM ARGUING FOR IS THE ABILITY

04:47:34.036 --> 04:47:36.005
FOR AN INVESTIGATION TO HAPPEN

04:47:36.072 --> 04:47:40.509
AND WE FACED NOW WERE MANY MANY

04:47:40.576 --> 04:47:42.545
SHOOTINGS OFFICER INVOLVED

04:47:42.612 --> 04:47:45.514
SHOOTINGS HAVE NOT HAD AN

04:47:45.581 --> 04:47:49.051
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION. AND

04:47:49.118 --> 04:47:50.953
FAMILIES COMMUNITIES. AND

04:47:51.020 --> 04:47:53.089
OTHERS HAVE FELT THAT THERE IS

04:47:53.155 --> 04:47:55.725
NO ABILITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER

04:47:55.791 --> 04:47:58.694
PROTOCOLS WERE FOLLOWED OR

04:47:58.761 --> 04:48:02.398
WHETHER THERE WAS LEGITIMATE.

04:48:02.465 --> 04:48:05.167
WHETHER THAT WAS A- WHETHER THE

04:48:05.234 --> 04:48:07.436
OFFICER WAS- EXONERATED

04:48:07.503 --> 04:48:10.039
LEGITIMATELY OR NOT AND I THINK

04:48:10.106 --> 04:48:13.242
THIS IS ESSENTIAL FOR JUSTICE

04:48:13.309 --> 04:48:15.077
ESSENTIAL FOR BUILDING TRUST

04:48:15.144 --> 04:48:16.379
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT BETWEEN

04:48:16.445 --> 04:48:18.581
THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE AND

04:48:18.648 --> 04:48:20.149
NECESSARY TO CORRECT SOMETHING

04:48:20.216 --> 04:48:21.584

04:51:36.412 --> 04:51:39.782
STEP BACK. AND GO TO SIFT

04:51:39.849 --> 04:51:42.685
THROUGH THE OUTRAGE THAT IS

04:51:42.751 --> 04:51:44.753
BEING EXPERIENCED AND FELT IN

04:51:44.820 --> 04:51:46.922
TRYING TO GET TO THE THRUST OF

04:51:46.989 --> 04:51:48.757
WHAT IS THIS BILL IS REALLY

04:51:48.824 --> 04:51:53.863
ABOUT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

04:51:53.929 --> 04:51:56.999
THE AG HAS ALWAYS HAD THE

04:51:57.066 --> 04:51:59.101
AUTHORITY. TO INITIATE AN

04:51:59.168 --> 04:52:01.403
INVESTIGATION. INTO POLICE

04:52:01.470 --> 04:52:04.773

THOSE WHO SUFFER AT THE HANDS.

04:52:13.315 --> 04:52:15.584
OF BAD APPLES IN LAW

04:52:15.651 --> 04:52:17.887
ENFORCEMENT. AND I DON'T THINK

04:52:17.953 --> 04:52:20.856
I FULLY UNDERSTAND WHY THIS

04:52:20.923 --> 04:52:22.925
PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION

04:52:22.992 --> 04:52:25.561
IS NEEDED IF WE DEMAND IS A

04:52:25.628 --> 04:52:27.796
COMMUNITY. THERE BE

04:52:27.863 --> 04:52:29.865
TRANSPARENCY THAT THEY'RE BEING

04:52:29.932 --> 04:52:32.768
INITIATION BY THE AG'S OFFICE

04:52:32.835 --> 04:52:35.137
EITHER BY DISPATCHED ATTORNEY

04:52:35.204 --> 04:52:36.906
OR BY THE CREATION OF A

04:52:36.972 --> 04:52:38.440
SUBDIVISION WITHIN THE AG'S

04:52:38.507 --> 04:52:41.510
OFFICE. HAVEN'T THEY ALWAYS HAD

04:52:41.577 --> 04:52:43.746
THE AUTHORITY TO DO THIS SO

04:52:43.812 --> 04:52:44.580
THAT'S WHY I'M JUST KIND OF

04:52:44.647 --> 04:52:46.982
PUZZLED THAT IN OUR CURRENT

04:52:47.049 --> 04:52:50.019
OUTRAGE AND DESPERATION FOR

04:52:50.085 --> 04:52:52.788
LEGISLATION HAVE WE EVER ASKED

04:52:52.855 --> 04:52:55.457
HOW WE HELD OUR CURRENT AG AND

04:52:55.524 --> 04:52:58.928
THOSE BEFORE- THE CURRENT AG

04:52:58.994 --> 04:53:00.629
ACCOUNTABLE. THAT THIS IS A

04:53:00.696 --> 04:53:03.432
COMMUNITY DEMANDS AND MAYBE NOT

04:53:03.499 --> 04:53:05.434
JUST AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT

04:53:05.501 --> 04:53:06.368
ALSO AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS

04:53:06.435 --> 04:53:08.570
WELL IF THERE ARE FEDERAL CIVIL

04:53:08.637 --> 04:53:11.373

PROBABLY BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS.

04:53:17.346 --> 04:53:18.914
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WE

04:53:18.981 --> 04:53:21.116
SHOULD THINK THAT. THIS IS

04:53:21.183 --> 04:53:22.885
GRANTING POWERS THEY DIDN'T

04:53:22.952 --> 04:53:24.453
ALREADY EXIST MAYBE WE SHOULD

04:53:24.520 --> 04:53:26.889
BE ASKING OURSELVES WHY WEREN'T

04:53:26.956 --> 04:53:28.490
THESE POWERS ACTED UPON.

04:53:28.557 --> 04:53:32.328

THE PASSION ON THE SUBJECT

04:53:41.937 --> 04:53:43.005
MATTERS THAT WE ARE DEALING

04:53:43.072 --> 04:53:47.743
WITH- BOTH I'M FROM BOTH SIDES

SENATE FLOOR ANY ANYBODY I

04:53:55.517 --> 04:53:58.387

04:53:58.454 --> 04:54:00.489
THAT WATCHING SOMEBODY HAVE

TOTALLY AGREE WITH MY

04:54:15.204 --> 04:54:17.006
COLLEAGUES ON THAT THAT AT ALL

04:54:17.072 --> 04:54:18.207
AND I REALIZE THAT THIS IS AN

04:54:18.273 --> 04:54:21.310
EMOTIONALLY CHARGED ISSUE AND-

04:54:21.377 --> 04:54:22.945
I DO WANT TO GET BACK TO THE

04:54:23.012 --> 04:54:24.780
BILL AT HAND IF POSSIBLE THE

04:54:24.847 --> 04:54:26.382
CONCERN AND WHY CAN'T SUPPORT

04:54:26.448 --> 04:54:29.151
THIS BILL TODAY IS THAT AND

04:54:29.218 --> 04:54:31.553
DEAD THE VERSION OF THE BILL IS

04:54:31.620 --> 04:54:34.757
ODDLY DEFINED AS AN ARMED

04:54:34.823 --> 04:54:37.659
CIVILIAN- AND IT'S AS THE

04:54:37.726 --> 04:54:39.762
DEFINITION OF IT IS AS CARRYING

04:54:39.828 --> 04:54:41.930
AN UNLOADED FIREARM. I ASK YOU

04:54:41.997 --> 04:54:43.599
TO PUT YOURSELF IN THE POSITION

04:54:43.665 --> 04:54:46.368
OF A POLICE OFFICER AND WHO IS

04:54:46.435 --> 04:54:48.470
THAT COMING UP ON SOMEBODY WHO

04:54:48.537 --> 04:54:51.206
IS DATABASE THINK HAS COMMITTED

04:54:51.273 --> 04:54:51.974
A CRIME OR IS COMMITTING A

04:54:52.041 --> 04:54:54.043
CRIME AND DOESN'T MATTER THEIR

04:54:54.109 --> 04:54:56.178
SKIN COLOR BUT THAT- THAT

04:54:56.245 --> 04:54:58.013
INDIVIDUAL THAT THEY'RE COMING

04:54:58.080 --> 04:54:59.648
IN CONTACT WITH PULLS OUT A

04:54:59.715 --> 04:55:02.084
FIREARM AND HOW DOES THE POLICE

04:55:02.151 --> 04:55:04.920
OFFICER EVEN KNOWN THAT THAT IS

04:55:04.987 --> 04:55:08.323
NOT A LOADED FIREARM AND- IF

04:55:08.390 --> 04:55:10.426
YOU MAKE THE WRONG DECISION AND

04:55:10.492 --> 04:55:12.961
IT WAS A LOADED FIREARM- THEN

04:55:13.028 --> 04:55:14.696
THAT COULD COST YOU YOUR LIFE

04:55:14.763 --> 04:55:15.964
AND NOT YOU NOT BE ABLE TO GO

04:55:16.031 --> 04:55:17.599
HOME WITH YOUR FAMILY SO. I

04:55:17.666 --> 04:55:19.401
THINK WE REALLY NEED TO RETHINK

04:55:19.468 --> 04:55:22.204

04:55:22.271 --> 04:55:24.106

KNOW YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT

04:55:27.476 --> 04:55:29.244
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT BUT THE

04:55:29.311 --> 04:55:30.846
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT TO PUT OUR

04:55:30.913 --> 04:55:32.981
LAW ENFORCEMENT INTO A POSITION

04:55:33.048 --> 04:55:33.749
WHERE SOMEBODY PULLS OUT A

04:55:33.816 --> 04:55:35.918
FIREARM I'M IN THEY HAVE TO

04:55:35.984 --> 04:55:37.553
MAKE A SPLIT SECOND DECISION TO

04:55:37.619 --> 04:55:39.755
SEE IF THEY WERE GONNA. BE

04:55:39.822 --> 04:55:42.491
KILLED OR NOT AND THEN TO COME

04:55:42.558 --> 04:55:43.759
TO FIND OUT LATER AFTER THEY

04:55:43.826 --> 04:55:48.430
TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION ACTION.

04:55:48.497 --> 04:55:50.432
THE THREAT IS THAT HOW IT'S

04:55:50.499 --> 04:55:52.301
TRAIN WE GO THROUGH TRAINING

LEMONADE WHAT APPEARS AT THAT

04:55:57.573 --> 04:55:58.807
MOMENT TO BE A THREAT AND THEN

04:55:58.874 --> 04:56:00.809
FIND OUT LATER THAT IT WAS- AND

04:56:00.876 --> 04:56:02.511
UNLOADED FIREARMS THAT'S A

04:56:02.578 --> 04:56:04.446
PRETTY TOUGH CALL TO MAKE FOR

04:56:04.513 --> 04:56:05.214
SOMEBODY IN A HEIGHTENED

04:56:05.280 --> 04:56:07.382

MAKE A SPLIT SECOND DECISION

04:56:12.321 --> 04:56:13.822
AND TO NOTE TO THINK THAT YOUR

04:56:13.889 --> 04:56:16.225
LIFE IS ON THE LINE AS WELL- SO

04:56:16.291 --> 04:56:18.694
I THINK THAT. THAT DEFINITION

04:56:18.760 --> 04:56:20.762
THAT SAYS- A KEY IT'S A DEFINED

04:56:20.829 --> 04:56:22.197
AS AN UNARMED CIVILIAN AS ONE

04:56:22.264 --> 04:56:23.832

THAT HAS BEEN WITH US AND THAT

05:30:42.222 --> 05:30:44.257
UNDERMINES CONFIDENCE IN THE

THE UNACCEPTABLE SHOOTINGS AND

05:31:07.414 --> 05:31:09.950
MURDERS THAT WE HAVE SEEN. BUT

05:31:10.016 --> 05:31:11.851
WE NEED TO ALSO BE CLEAR THAT

05:31:11.918 --> 05:31:16.122
POLICING. IS STEP ONE OF OUR

05:31:16.189 --> 05:31:18.825
BROKEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

05:31:18.892 --> 05:31:21.461
A BROKEN SYSTEM THAT IS PART OF

05:31:21.528 --> 05:31:23.496
THE STRUCTURAL RACISM THAT WE

05:31:23.563 --> 05:31:25.799

GONNA FACE A TRIAL SYSTEM. THAT

05:31:39.312 --> 05:31:42.349
IS A PROBLEM AND THAT LEADS TO

05:31:42.415 --> 05:31:45.185
OVER INCARCERATION AND MASS

05:31:45.252 --> 05:31:46.486
INCARCERATION. THAT DOESN'T

05:31:46.553 --> 05:31:47.654
ALWAYS PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH A

05:31:47.721 --> 05:31:50.457
FAIR TRIAL TO WHICH THEY ARE

05:31:50.523 --> 05:31:54.961

DISCRIMINATION BARRED THE

05:31:58.665 --> 05:32:00.800
STRIKING OF PEOPLE BASED ON

05:32:00.867 --> 05:32:03.103
RACES FROM JURIES IN NINETEEN

05:32:03.169 --> 05:32:04.504
SEVENTY EIGHT. THE US SUPREME

05:32:04.571 --> 05:32:07.007

FORTY YEARS COURTS AND LEGAL

05:32:11.444 --> 05:32:13.313
SCHOLARS HAVE DEBATED WHETHER

05:32:13.380 --> 05:32:17.450
THE PROCESS IN EXISTENCE. IS

05:32:17.517 --> 05:32:19.719
ADEQUATE AT STOPPING ANGEL

05:32:19.786 --> 05:32:21.788
DISCRIMINATION IN THE SELECTION

05:32:21.855 --> 05:32:26.559
OF JURIES. CALLING THIS PROCESS

05:32:26.626 --> 05:32:28.495
THE DATSUN WHEELER PROCESS HAS

05:32:28.561 --> 05:32:30.964
FAILED. THAT IS ACROSS THE

05:32:31.031 --> 05:32:32.899
NATION SHOW THE JURIES ARE

05:32:32.966 --> 05:32:35.502
DISPROPORTIONATELY WHITES

05:32:35.568 --> 05:32:38.471
THEY'RE WHITER AND WEALTHIER

05:32:38.538 --> 05:32:40.740
THAN THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE.

05:32:40.807 --> 05:32:42.709
THE ALAMEDA COUNTY PUBLIC

05:32:42.776 --> 05:32:43.276
DEFENDER TOLD THE JUDICIARY

05:32:43.343 --> 05:32:45.912
COMMITTEE. HE HAS DIFFICULTY

05:32:45.979 --> 05:32:47.447
GETTING AFRICAN AMERICAN JURORS

05:32:47.514 --> 05:32:50.050
ON JURIES IN OAKLAND TO THE

05:32:50.116 --> 05:32:52.385
PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES. AND I

05:32:52.452 --> 05:32:54.054
KNOW EVERYONE KNOWS PROTESTING

05:32:54.120 --> 05:32:56.256
CASE A PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE IS

05:32:56.323 --> 05:32:58.491
ONE ATTORNEY CAN STRIKE SOMEONE

05:32:58.558 --> 05:33:01.561
FROM A JURY. FOR PRETTY MUCH

05:33:01.628 --> 05:33:06.032
ANY REASON. AB THIRTY SEVEN IT

05:33:06.099 --> 05:33:07.567
DOES NOT CHANGE THE EXISTING

05:33:07.634 --> 05:33:09.035
SUBSTANTIVE LAW BARRING

05:33:09.102 --> 05:33:10.804
DISCRIMINATION IT'S BEEN

05:33:10.870 --> 05:33:12.672
ILLEGAL FOR OVER FORTY YEARS

05:33:12.739 --> 05:33:14.140
THE STRIKE SOMEONE FROM A JURY

05:33:14.207 --> 05:33:17.277
BASED ON RACE. WHAT IT CHANGES

05:33:17.344 --> 05:33:18.511
IS THE COURT PROCESS FOR

05:33:18.578 --> 05:33:19.913
ASSESSING WHETHER A PEREMPTORY

05:33:19.979 --> 05:33:22.015
CHALLENGE IS BASED ON RACIAL

05:33:22.082 --> 05:33:24.884
DISCRIMINATION. IT MAKES A FEW

05:33:24.951 --> 05:33:27.220
NEEDED CHANGES AND THE GOAL

05:33:27.287 --> 05:33:29.456
HERE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

05:33:29.522 --> 05:33:31.691
HAD A BROADER AND FAIRER CROSS

05:33:31.758 --> 05:33:33.360
SECTION OF OUR COMMUNITY

05:33:33.426 --> 05:33:34.694
REPRESENTING OUR FULL

05:33:34.761 --> 05:33:37.597
DIVERSITY. EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY

05:33:37.664 --> 05:33:39.232
ALLOWS JUDGES TO OBJECT ON

05:33:39.299 --> 05:33:41.501
THEIR OWN MOTION TO PEREMPTORY

05:33:41.568 --> 05:33:44.204
CHALLENGES BASED ON CONCERNS BY

05:33:44.270 --> 05:33:46.272
THE COURT ABOUT RACIAL

05:33:46.339 --> 05:33:49.008
DISCRIMINATION. EIGHTY THREE

05:33:49.075 --> 05:33:50.910
SEVENTY SHIFTS THE BURDEN FROM

05:33:50.977 --> 05:33:53.046
THE PERSON WHO IS OBJECTING. TO

05:33:53.113 --> 05:33:54.948
A PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE. TO THE

05:33:55.014 --> 05:33:56.583
PERSON EXERCISING THE

05:33:56.649 --> 05:33:58.918
PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE THE PERSON

05:33:58.985 --> 05:34:00.754
WHO EXERCISES THE CHALLENGE

05:34:00.820 --> 05:34:03.590
WE'LL HAVE TO JUSTIFY IT AS NOT

05:34:03.656 --> 05:34:06.559
BASED ON RACE. AT THIRTY SEVEN

05:34:06.626 --> 05:34:08.461
CHANGES THE STANDARD. FROM

05:34:08.528 --> 05:34:11.297
SUBJECTIVE INTENT TO OBJECT OF

05:34:11.364 --> 05:34:13.700
ACTION. SO INSTEAD OF HAVING TO

05:34:13.767 --> 05:34:16.503
PROVE PURPOSEFUL DISCRIMINATION

05:34:16.569 --> 05:34:17.704
WHICH CAN BE DIFFICULT TO

05:34:17.771 --> 05:34:20.407
IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE THAT THE

05:34:20.473 --> 05:34:22.108
ATTORNEY STRUCK SOMEONE BECAUSE

05:34:22.175 --> 05:34:24.544
THE ATTORNEY INTENDED TO

05:34:24.611 --> 05:34:26.546
DISCRIMINATE BASED ON RACE.

05:34:26.613 --> 05:34:29.215
INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT THE

05:34:29.282 --> 05:34:31.251
TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES

05:34:31.317 --> 05:34:32.352
AND WHETHER THERE IS A

05:34:32.419 --> 05:34:34.220
SUBSTANTIAL LIKELIHOOD THAT AN

05:34:34.287 --> 05:34:36.055
OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE PERSON

05:34:36.122 --> 05:34:38.658
WOULD YOU RACE AS A FACTOR. IN

05:34:38.725 --> 05:34:39.459
THE USE OF THAT PEREMPTORY

05:34:39.526 --> 05:34:41.861
CHALLENGE WE KNOW THAT DUE TO

05:34:41.928 --> 05:34:43.596
IMPLICIT BIAS PEOPLE MAY NOT

05:34:43.663 --> 05:34:46.032
ALWAYS BE MALICIOUSLY INTENDING

05:34:46.099 --> 05:34:48.034
TO EXCLUDE SOMEONE BUT THE

05:34:48.101 --> 05:34:50.136
EFFECT IS THE SAME. GUY THE

05:34:50.203 --> 05:34:53.540
EXCLUSION WAS BASED ON RACE.

05:34:53.606 --> 05:34:55.775
THE BILL ALSO ESTABLISHES A

05:34:55.842 --> 05:34:58.411
NUMBER OF PRESUMPTIVELY INVALID

05:34:58.478 --> 05:35:00.480
REASONS. FOR A PEREMPTORY

05:35:00.547 --> 05:35:03.249
CHALLENGE. FOR EXAMPLE IF

05:35:03.316 --> 05:35:05.385
SOMEONE WHO HAS HAD MEMBERS OF

05:35:05.452 --> 05:35:07.086
THEIR FAMILY WHO HAVE HAD

05:35:07.153 --> 05:35:10.023
INTERACTIONS WITH THE POLICE OR

05:35:10.089 --> 05:35:10.523
WHO HAVE SOME DEGREE OF

05:35:10.590 --> 05:35:13.293
SKEPTICISM. OF THE POLICE

05:35:13.359 --> 05:35:14.727
THERE'S A LAUNDRY LIST OF

05:35:14.794 --> 05:35:16.229
FACTORS THAT ATTORNEYS HAVE

05:35:16.296 --> 05:35:17.997
USED TO EXCLUDE PEOPLE THAT

05:35:18.064 --> 05:35:21.301
HAVE THE EFFECT. OF BEING BASED

05:35:21.367 --> 05:35:24.938
ON DISPROPORTIONATELY ON RACE.

05:35:25.004 --> 05:35:26.206
THE V. THIRTY SEVENTY

05:35:26.272 --> 05:35:29.175
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THE

05:35:29.242 --> 05:35:31.544
DYNAMICS IN JUROR SELECTION TO

05:35:31.611 --> 05:35:33.480
REDUCE RACIAL DISCRIMINATION

05:35:33.546 --> 05:35:35.281
AND INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF

05:35:35.348 --> 05:35:37.851
THOSE WHO SERVE ON OUR JURIES

05:35:37.917 --> 05:35:40.386
AND AGAIN WE HAVE TO

05:35:40.453 --> 05:35:42.222
FUNDAMENTALLY FIX POLICING. BUT

05:35:42.288 --> 05:35:46.526
IF WE FIX POLICING AND STOP

05:35:46.593 --> 05:35:47.794
THERE WE HAVE FAILED. AND ONE

05:35:47.861 --> 05:35:49.162
PIECE THAT WE HAVE TO FIX ITS

05:35:49.229 --> 05:35:52.432
HOW WE TAKE OUR JURIES AT

05:35:52.499 --> 05:35:54.534
THIRTY SEVENTY AS LONG OVERDUE.

05:35:54.601 --> 05:35:55.969
WE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE

05:35:56.035 --> 05:35:58.571

CALIFORNIA'S COURTS TO ASSESS

05:36:39.345 --> 05:36:42.949
WHETHER A CHALLENGE TO SOMEONE

HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING ON THIS

05:36:59.832 --> 05:37:02.569
FLOOR. IT IS RACIAL EQUITY AND

05:37:02.635 --> 05:37:06.639
THE IMPACT. OF SYSTEMIC RACISM

05:37:06.706 --> 05:37:08.541

05:37:20.219 --> 05:37:21.955
NATION AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA

05:37:22.021 --> 05:37:23.456
AS I'VE SAID FOR HUNDREDS OF

05:37:23.523 --> 05:37:25.058
YEARS EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT

05:37:25.124 --> 05:37:27.093
BIAS OBTAINED IN OUR SYSTEMS OF

05:37:27.160 --> 05:37:29.195
BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT.

05:37:29.262 --> 05:37:30.663
UNFORTUNATELY OUR JUSTICE

05:37:30.730 --> 05:37:32.265
SYSTEM AND ITS COURT ROOMS IN

05:37:32.332 --> 05:37:34.567
JURIES ARE NOT IMMUNE. THE JURY

05:37:34.634 --> 05:37:35.635
SYSTEM IS ONE OF OUR MOST

05:37:35.702 --> 05:37:37.136
IMPORTANT FRONT LINES OF DUE

05:37:37.203 --> 05:37:38.538
PROCESS INCLUSION AND

05:37:38.605 --> 05:37:40.473
REPRESENTATION ARE CRITICAL

05:37:40.540 --> 05:37:41.708
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO OUR

05:37:41.774 --> 05:37:43.743
JUSTICE SYSTEM DIVERSITY SHOULD

05:37:43.810 --> 05:37:45.545
NOT JUST BE A CIRCUMSTANTIAL

05:37:45.612 --> 05:37:48.414
BONUS. IT'S FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR

05:37:48.481 --> 05:37:50.416
JURY SYSTEM MOREOVER A JURY OF

05:37:50.483 --> 05:37:52.852
ONE'S PEERS IS FOUNDATIONAL TO

05:37:52.919 --> 05:37:54.520
HAVING A FAIR JURY AND

05:37:54.587 --> 05:37:57.824
OBTAINING A FAIR TRIAL. MAYBE

05:37:57.890 --> 05:37:58.358
THIRTY SEVENTY IS A STEP

05:37:58.424 --> 05:37:59.659
TOWARDS PREVENTING ATTORNEYS

05:37:59.726 --> 05:38:01.327
AND JUDGES FROM UNFAIRLY

05:38:01.394 --> 05:38:03.296
REMOVING PEOPLE FROM A JURY.

05:38:03.363 --> 05:38:04.864
COOL BASED ON ACTUAL OR

05:38:04.931 --> 05:38:07.033
PERCEIVED RACE ETHNICITY OR

05:38:07.100 --> 05:38:09.302
NATIONAL ORIGIN. AND IT'S AN

05:38:09.369 --> 05:38:10.870
OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO

05:38:10.937 --> 05:38:13.239
INTERPRET THE STRUCTURAL RACISM

05:38:13.306 --> 05:38:14.407
THAT HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO

05:38:14.474 --> 05:38:15.742
PERMEATE PERMEATE OUR JUSTICE

05:38:15.808 --> 05:38:20.279
SYSTEM. EIGHTY THIRTY SEVEN IS

05:38:20.346 --> 05:38:21.414
A CHANCE FOR US TO RIGHT THIS

05:38:21.481 --> 05:38:23.149
WRONG WE TALKED THE TALK AND

05:38:23.216 --> 05:38:24.884
NOW I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO

05:38:24.951 --> 05:38:26.119
WALK THE WALK I RESPECTFULLY

05:38:26.185 --> 05:38:28.054
URGE AND I THOUGHT. THANK YOU

05:38:28.121 --> 05:38:29.355
SENATOR ATKINS WE'RE GOING TO

05:38:29.422 --> 05:38:31.290
GO TO A REMOTE VOTERS I HAVE

05:38:31.357 --> 05:38:33.393
ONE HAND UP AND THAT IS SENATOR

05:38:33.459 --> 05:38:42.535
BORCHERS SENATOR GORGEOUS.

05:38:42.602 --> 05:38:49.308
THANK YOU. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

05:38:49.375 --> 05:38:52.612
THIS BILL AND I THINK EVERYBODY

05:38:52.679 --> 05:38:54.414
IN THE ROOM SHOULD BE BECAUSE-

05:38:54.480 --> 05:38:58.818
ITS IMPACT IS SO. FOUNDATIONAL

05:38:58.885 --> 05:39:02.288
THAT THIS IS NOT. YOUR EVERYDAY

05:39:02.355 --> 05:39:04.023
TYPE OF LEGISLATION THAT COMES

05:39:04.090 --> 05:39:07.927
ACROSS OUR DESK THIS IS THIS

05:39:07.994 --> 05:39:09.762
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE

05:39:09.829 --> 05:39:12.398
VIRTUALLY EVERY ASPECT OF

05:39:12.465 --> 05:39:15.368
COURTROOM PROCEEDINGS OFFICES

05:39:15.435 --> 05:39:17.203
CONDUCT THEMSELVES IN THE

05:39:17.270 --> 05:39:19.605
JUDICIAL ARM OR IN THE-

05:39:19.672 --> 05:39:22.075
PROSECUTORIAL PROCESS. AND I

05:39:22.141 --> 05:39:23.876
WOULDN'T WANT US TO JUMP INTO

05:39:23.943 --> 05:39:26.179
THIS NOT AT LEAST ADDRESSING

05:39:26.245 --> 05:39:28.281
SOME OF THE SHORTCOMINGS. I

05:39:28.347 --> 05:39:30.983
THINK THE IDEA BEHIND IT IS TO

05:39:31.050 --> 05:39:34.253
EQUALIZE ARE THE JURY POOL AND

05:39:34.320 --> 05:39:35.054
ALLOW IT TO BE MORE

05:39:35.121 --> 05:39:38.291
REPRESENTATIVE. OF THE

05:39:38.357 --> 05:39:38.958
COMMUNITY BUT THE LEGAL

05:39:39.025 --> 05:39:42.328
TRADITION THAT HAS DEVELOPED.

05:39:42.395 --> 05:39:44.330
IN JURY SELECTION. HAS

05:39:44.397 --> 05:39:48.134
BASICALLY ALLOWED THE PARTIES

05:39:48.201 --> 05:39:50.536
TO SH TO- TO ELIMINATE ALL

05:39:50.603 --> 05:39:53.973
POTENTIAL JURORS WITHOUT COST

05:39:54.040 --> 05:39:54.507
WITHOUT HAVING TO EXPLAIN

05:39:54.574 --> 05:39:56.876
THEMSELVES. AND I THINK GATHERS

05:39:56.943 --> 05:39:57.777
AND BENEFITS THERE'S ALSO

05:39:57.844 --> 05:40:00.246
DRAWBACKS COMMUNITY DRAWBACKS

05:40:00.313 --> 05:40:03.649
TO THAT. BUT TO CREATE. AS A

05:40:03.716 --> 05:40:07.053
MATTER OF LAW THAT AID

05:40:07.120 --> 05:40:09.889
DISMISSAL OF A JUROR ON THE WAR

05:40:09.956 --> 05:40:12.725
IT FEATURES NOT SELECTED THAT

05:40:12.792 --> 05:40:14.961
IT MUST BE FOR COSTS AND THE

05:40:15.027 --> 05:40:18.197
PRESUMPTION IS THAT THE

05:40:18.264 --> 05:40:20.700
INDIVIDUAL ATTORNEY SEEKING TO

05:40:20.767 --> 05:40:23.069
REMOVE SOMEONE FROM THE POOL

05:40:23.136 --> 05:40:25.905
HOUSE TO PROVE UP WHY THEY'RE

05:40:25.972 --> 05:40:29.041
DOING IT IN WAYS THAT DON'T

05:40:29.108 --> 05:40:31.878
PERTAIN TO. ETHNICITY GENDER

05:40:31.944 --> 05:40:35.982
SEX. NATIONALITY RELIGIOUS

05:40:36.048 --> 05:40:38.017
AFFILIATION. I THINK IS GOING

05:40:38.084 --> 05:40:39.852
TO CREATE AN INORDINATE AMOUNT

05:40:39.919 --> 05:40:42.221
OF PROBLEMS THOSE I THINK CAN

05:40:42.288 --> 05:40:43.923
BE OVERCOME IT'S THE OTHER

05:40:43.990 --> 05:40:45.525
THINGS THAT I THINK WE NEED TO

05:40:45.591 --> 05:40:48.461
PAY ATTENTION TO THIS BILL

05:40:48.528 --> 05:40:50.563
SPECIFIES THAT BEING

05:40:50.630 --> 05:40:52.832
INATTENTIVE. HAVING A

05:40:52.899 --> 05:40:54.734
PROBLEMATIC ATTITUDE OR

05:40:54.801 --> 05:40:57.303
PROVIDING UNINTELLIGENT OR

05:40:57.370 --> 05:40:59.772
CONFUSED ANSWERS. ARE

05:40:59.839 --> 05:41:03.376
PRESUMPTIVELY INVALID. UNLESS

05:41:03.442 --> 05:41:04.710
THE TRIAL COURT IS ABLE TO

05:41:04.777 --> 05:41:06.045
CONFIRM THAT THE ASSERTIVE

05:41:06.112 --> 05:41:08.581
BEHAVIOR OCCURRED AND THEN ONLY

05:41:08.648 --> 05:41:09.916
IF THE MOVING PARTY CAN PROVE

05:41:09.982 --> 05:41:11.717
THAT THE BEHAVIOR MATTERS TO

05:41:11.784 --> 05:41:16.656
THE CASE. THIS IS NOT JUST

05:41:16.722 --> 05:41:18.457
REVERSING THE BONUS. THIS IS

05:41:18.524 --> 05:41:22.161
TAKING AWAY FUNDAMENTAL.

05:41:22.228 --> 05:41:24.197
FUNCTIONALITY OF THE JURY POOL.

05:41:24.263 --> 05:41:26.032
THAT YOU GIVE SOMEONE CANNOT

05:41:26.098 --> 05:41:28.067
PAY ATTENTION OR SOMEONE IS

05:41:28.134 --> 05:41:30.303
ABSOLUTELY GET ATTENTIVE CANNOT

05:41:30.369 --> 05:41:31.504
IS NOT PROCESSING THE

05:41:31.571 --> 05:41:32.972
CONVEYANCE OF EVIDENCE AND

05:41:33.039 --> 05:41:36.042
INFORMATION. DISALLOWING THAT

05:41:36.108 --> 05:41:37.777
INDIVIDUAL TO BE RMOVED I

05:41:37.844 --> 05:41:42.281
THINK IS. IT IT IT DEFIES LOGIC

05:41:42.348 --> 05:41:45.151
ARIANNA I THINK THAT THIS CAN

05:41:45.218 --> 05:41:47.520
BE REDRAFTED BUT LET'S ALSO NOT

05:41:47.587 --> 05:41:49.255
FORGET THAT THIS IS ALSO GOING

05:41:49.322 --> 05:41:54.327
TO APPLY TO CIVIL TRIALS IN

05:41:54.393 --> 05:41:54.927
TWENTY TWENTY SIX. WE ARE FOR

05:41:54.994 --> 05:41:58.464
THIS BILL. ATTEMPTS TO WRITE

05:41:58.531 --> 05:42:01.167
EVERY HISTORICAL INJUSTICE AS

05:42:01.234 --> 05:42:03.803
MANIFESTED IN THE JURY PROCESS

05:42:03.870 --> 05:42:05.471
AND I THINK IT IS WITH SUCH A

05:42:05.538 --> 05:42:07.573
HEAVY HAMMER BUT THERE WILL BE

05:42:07.640 --> 05:42:09.308
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THIS

05:42:09.375 --> 05:42:11.477
DESERVES TO BE BROUGHT BACK IN

05:42:11.544 --> 05:42:13.412

05:42:17.416 --> 05:42:19.051
BECAUSE THERE'S NO GOING BACK

05:42:19.118 --> 05:42:20.920
THIS DESERVES A MORE THOROUGH

05:42:20.987 --> 05:42:23.756
NON. COATED TRUNCATED

05:42:23.823 --> 05:42:26.225

OF ALL THE RELEVANT COMMITTEES

BECAUSE I THINK AT TIS POINT

05:42:33.666 --> 05:42:35.601
CERTAIN FOLKS ARE. BEING ABLE

05:42:35.668 --> 05:42:36.802
TO OPPORTUNISTIC LEAD

05:42:36.869 --> 05:42:38.304
STREAMLINED THE LEGISLATIVE

05:42:38.371 --> 05:42:40.773

OUR LEGISLATIVE CYCLE TO SUCH A

05:42:42.508 --> 05:42:43.843

05:45:05.151 --> 05:45:06.685
NO FURTHER THAN WASHINGTON'S

05:45:06.752 --> 05:45:08.621
EXAMPLE TO MAKE THIS POINT

05:45:08.687 --> 05:45:09.789
STUDIES LEADING TO THE ADOPTION

05:45:09.855 --> 05:45:11.557
OF. G. R. THIRTY SEVEN

05:45:11.624 --> 05:45:13.225
IDENTIFIED THE SAME INTRACTABLE

05:45:13.292 --> 05:45:14.994
DISCRIMINATORY JURY SELECTION

05:45:15.061 --> 05:45:16.729
PRACTICES UNDER BATS OF. THE

05:45:16.796 --> 05:45:17.930
WASHINGTON SUPREME COURT

05:45:17.997 --> 05:45:19.632
IMPLEMENTED A PRACTICAL

05:45:19.698 --> 05:45:23.202
WORKABLE SOLUTION THROUGH G. R.

05:45:23.269 --> 05:45:24.603
THIRTY SEVEN WHICH IS THE BASIS

05:45:24.670 --> 05:45:29.041
FOR A B. THIRTY SEVENTY. BUT AT

05:45:29.108 --> 05:45:29.742
THIRTY SEVENTY. GOES WELL

05:45:29.809 --> 05:45:31.911
BEYOND AND IS QUITE DIFFERENT

05:45:31.977 --> 05:45:33.579
THAN WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN

05:45:33.646 --> 05:45:37.850
WASHINGTON STATE. AP THIRTY

05:45:37.917 --> 05:45:39.251
SEVEN EXCUSE ME A. B. THIRTY

05:45:39.318 --> 05:45:40.953
SEVENTY GOES SO FAR BEYOND THAT

05:45:41.020 --> 05:45:41.954
THE ASSOCIATION OF AFRICAN

05:45:42.021 --> 05:45:44.657
AMERICAN JUDICIAL OFFICERS SAID

05:45:44.723 --> 05:45:46.492
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.

05:45:46.559 --> 05:45:49.495
WE NEED TO STEP BACK AND LOOK

05:45:49.562 --> 05:45:50.863
AT WHAT HAPPENED IN WASHINGTON

05:45:50.930 --> 05:45:53.466
A COUPLE YEARS AGO. CALIFORNIA

05:45:53.532 --> 05:45:54.633
JUDGES ASSOCIATION SAID THERE

05:45:54.700 --> 05:45:56.402
NEEDS TO BE AMENDMENTS AND LET

05:45:56.469 --> 05:45:58.404
ME ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THE

05:45:58.471 --> 05:45:59.605
CHALLENGES SOME OF THE

05:45:59.672 --> 05:46:01.974
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. OF

05:46:02.041 --> 05:46:03.476
THIS AS I MENTIONED BEFORE YOU

05:46:03.542 --> 05:46:04.844
EXERCISE PEREMPTORIES BASED ON

05:46:04.910 --> 05:46:07.546
JUST SOME VERY RUDIMENTARY

05:46:07.613 --> 05:46:08.848
HELLO THAT INFORMATION UNLESS

05:46:08.914 --> 05:46:10.049
YOU'RE WEALTH UNLESS YOU HIRE

05:46:10.116 --> 05:46:12.151
A JURY CONSULTANT. WHO CAN LOOK

05:46:12.218 --> 05:46:16.088
IN. PROVIDE YOU INFORMATION AS

05:46:16.155 --> 05:46:16.689
TO WHO MIGHT BE FAVORABLE NOT

05:46:16.755 --> 05:46:18.958
BE FAVORABLE ONLY THE WEALTHY

05:46:19.024 --> 05:46:21.594
CAN DO THAT. BY THE WAY. BUT

05:46:21.660 --> 05:46:22.561
LET ME GIVE YOU AN ILLUSTRATION

05:46:22.628 --> 05:46:24.029
SO LONG TIME AGO AS FEDERAL

05:46:24.096 --> 05:46:26.031
PROSECUTOR NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE

05:46:26.098 --> 05:46:28.167
ORANGE COUNTY. THERE WAS A

05:46:28.234 --> 05:46:29.668
FAMILY AN AFRICAN AMERICAN

05:46:29.735 --> 05:46:32.271
FAMILY LIVED IN WESTMINSTER.

05:46:32.338 --> 05:46:34.140
SKIN HAS DECIDED TO DRIVE THEM

05:46:34.206 --> 05:46:36.742
OUT OF THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. BY

05:46:36.809 --> 05:46:37.309
BURNING A CROSS ON THE FRONT

05:46:37.376 --> 05:46:40.613
LAWN. AT THAT TIME THERE WERE

05:46:40.679 --> 05:46:42.848
NO HATE CRIME LAWS ON THE BOOKS.

05:46:42.915 --> 05:46:45.151
WE HAD A LAW A FEDERAL LAW THAT

05:46:45.217 --> 05:46:46.385
SAYS YOU CAN'T INTERFERE WITH

05:46:46.452 --> 05:46:47.887
SOMEONE IN THEIR EXERCISE OF

05:46:47.953 --> 05:46:49.622
THEIR RIGHT. TO OWN ON OCCUPIED

05:46:49.688 --> 05:46:52.825
HOUSING. WAS A MISDEMEANOR. BUT

05:46:52.892 --> 05:46:54.326
WE TOOK IT AND WE COMBINED WITH

05:46:54.393 --> 05:46:55.227
A CONSPIRACY TO MAKE IT A

05:46:55.294 --> 05:46:58.931
FELONY. NOW WE BEGIN THE TRIAL.

05:46:58.998 --> 05:47:01.033
I LOOKED AT THE JURY POOL.

05:47:01.100 --> 05:47:04.403
BASED ON JUST LOOKING AT THEM I

05:47:04.470 --> 05:47:07.006
HAD TO MAKE CERTAIN ASSESSMENTS.

05:47:07.072 --> 05:47:08.140
I SAW THAT THERE WAS NOT A

05:47:08.207 --> 05:47:09.408
SINGLE AFRICAN AMERICAN AMONG

05:47:09.475 --> 05:47:11.277
THEM BUT BEHIND ME IN THE

05:47:11.343 --> 05:47:15.481
VENEER. OR TO AFRICAN AMERICANS.

05:47:15.548 --> 05:47:17.850
AND I DESPERATELY WANTED AN

05:47:17.917 --> 05:47:19.885
AFRICAN AMERICAN ON THE JURY.

05:47:19.952 --> 05:47:21.954
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT BE

05:47:22.021 --> 05:47:25.324
ABLE TO EXPLAIN UNDERSTAND.

05:47:25.391 --> 05:47:27.893
WHAT BURNING A CROSS ON

05:47:27.960 --> 05:47:29.628
SOMEONE'S FRONT LAWN MEANT.

05:47:29.695 --> 05:47:31.096
BECAUSE THE DEFENSE WAS THIS

05:47:31.163 --> 05:47:33.199
WAS A PRANK THIS IS JUST A

05:47:33.265 --> 05:47:35.034
NEIGHBORHOOD CORAL OUT OF

05:47:35.100 --> 05:47:38.337
CONTROL BURNING A CROSS IS NOT

05:47:38.404 --> 05:47:39.104
A PRANK IT WAS AN ACT OF

05:47:39.171 --> 05:47:41.106
TERRORISM. AN ACT OF TERRORISM

05:47:41.173 --> 05:47:42.675
OVERCOME THAT DEFENSE I WANTED

05:47:42.741 --> 05:47:43.475
SOMEBODY ON THE JURY THEY COULD

05:47:43.542 --> 05:47:46.745
EXPLAIN THAT AND SO I LOOKED AT

05:47:46.812 --> 05:47:47.479
THE JURY POOL AND BASED ON

05:47:47.546 --> 05:47:49.748
CLOTHING AND OTHER THINGS I

05:47:49.815 --> 05:47:51.016
BOUNCED MEMBERS UNTIL AGAIN

05:47:51.083 --> 05:47:52.318
AFRICAN AMERICAN JUROR ON THE

05:47:52.384 --> 05:47:54.320
JURY POOL. IN THAT BOX SO THEY

05:47:54.386 --> 05:47:57.356
COULD. PRESUMABLY EXPLAIN WHY

05:47:57.423 --> 05:48:00.192
THIS WAS AN ACT OF TERROR. NOW

05:48:00.259 --> 05:48:01.493
I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING THAT'S

05:48:01.560 --> 05:48:03.095
JUST A SMALL EXAMPLE THAT'S

05:48:03.162 --> 05:48:05.864
JUST ONE EXAMPLE. AND IT IS ONE

05:48:05.931 --> 05:48:07.600
EXAMPLE. BUT THERE ARE GOING TO

05:48:07.666 --> 05:48:10.236
BE MANY EXAMPLES WHERE FOR

05:48:10.302 --> 05:48:12.271
EXAMPLE YOU HAVE. A BLACK

05:48:12.338 --> 05:48:15.074
VICTIM. AND YOU HAVE A WHITE

05:48:15.140 --> 05:48:17.443
OFFICER BECAUSE THIS WORKS BOTH

05:48:17.509 --> 05:48:19.678
WAYS IT DOES BASICALLY

05:48:19.745 --> 05:48:21.413
ELIMINATE THE PROSECUTION'S

05:48:21.480 --> 05:48:23.349
RIGHT PRINTER EARLY CHALLENGE

05:48:23.415 --> 05:48:23.849
BUT THAT HIS UNINTENDED

05:48:23.916 --> 05:48:25.718
CONSEQUENCES. THAT IS

05:48:25.784 --> 05:48:27.519
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

05:48:27.586 --> 05:48:29.188
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE THERE

05:48:29.255 --> 05:48:31.056
COULD BE MUCH MORE CHALLENGING.

05:48:31.123 --> 05:48:32.725
WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST THIS BILL

05:48:32.791 --> 05:48:35.027
IS NOT EFFECTIVE EVEN BY ITS

05:48:35.094 --> 05:48:36.362
OWN LANGUAGE TILL TWENTY TWENTY

05:48:36.428 --> 05:48:38.030
TWO. THAT WE DO IS TAKE A STEP

05:48:38.097 --> 05:48:40.666
BACK AND WE SPEND SOME TIME

05:48:40.733 --> 05:48:44.303
EXAMINING THIS VERY PROFOUND

05:48:44.370 --> 05:48:46.105
CHANGE TO OUR TRIAL PROCEDURE.

05:48:46.171 --> 05:48:47.840
WHEN WE COME UP PERHAPS WE DID

05:48:47.906 --> 05:48:50.409
NOT GENERALLY THIRTY SEVEN AS A

05:48:50.476 --> 05:48:52.611
SUGGESTED BY JUSTICE CAN

05:48:52.678 --> 05:48:55.147
THOUSAND WATCHING STATE. BUT WE

05:48:55.214 --> 05:48:56.081
NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK WE

05:48:56.148 --> 05:48:57.349
NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK BEFORE

05:48:57.416 --> 05:48:59.351
WE JUMP LISTEN WE CAN'T BECAUSE

05:48:59.418 --> 05:49:00.019
IT'S NOT EFFECTIVE TWENTY

05:49:00.085 --> 05:49:02.721
TWENTY TWO. I URGE FOLKS TO AT

05:49:02.788 --> 05:49:04.790
LEAST STAY OFFICE BILL SO WE

05:49:04.857 --> 05:49:05.824
HAVE A CHANCE TO CRAFT THE

05:49:05.891 --> 05:49:08.060
MECHANISM THAT IS FAIR TO ALL

05:49:08.127 --> 05:49:10.596
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR

HERE IS ONE OF A FEW. WHO IS

05:49:20.406 --> 05:49:21.940
ACTUALLY PICKED A JURY. IN A

05:49:22.007 --> 05:49:25.044
CRIMINAL CASE IT'S A VERY

05:49:25.110 --> 05:49:29.748
COMPLICATED PROCESS. IT IS AS

05:49:29.815 --> 05:49:31.483
FEDERER ON BURKE SAYS OFTEN

05:49:31.550 --> 05:49:34.586
TIMES YOU USE YOUR INTUITION.

05:49:34.653 --> 05:49:36.822
YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCE YOU TAKE A

05:49:36.889 --> 05:49:38.424
LOOK AT WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES

05:49:38.490 --> 05:49:41.360
ARE OF THE CASE. WHAT KIND OF

05:49:41.427 --> 05:49:44.897
INSURANCE DO YOU WANT. AND YES

05:49:44.963 --> 05:49:46.498
WE HAVE TRIED TO PROTECT

05:49:46.565 --> 05:49:48.767
AGAINST RACIAL BIAS IN OTHER

05:49:48.834 --> 05:49:51.704
BIASES BY A DECISION THAT IS

05:49:51.770 --> 05:49:53.305
THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS OLD I

05:49:53.372 --> 05:49:56.141
BELIEVE- BACK IN THE EIGHTIES-

05:49:56.208 --> 05:49:58.644
AND THERE IS A THERE THERE IS A

05:49:58.711 --> 05:50:00.746
PROCESS IF THERE IS A BELIEF

05:50:00.813 --> 05:50:03.549
THAT BIAS IS BEING EXERCISED.

05:50:03.615 --> 05:50:05.751
AND THE JUDGE IS SUPPOSED TO A

05:50:05.818 --> 05:50:10.055
CHALLENGE- THAT KIND OF SERIAL

05:50:10.122 --> 05:50:11.357
DISMISSAL OF A JUROR WITHOUT

05:50:11.423 --> 05:50:13.292
BECAUSE HE'S JUST I DON'T LIKE

05:50:13.359 --> 05:50:15.327
THE WAY THAT JUROR LOOKS SORE I

05:50:15.394 --> 05:50:16.128
WANT TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO

05:50:16.195 --> 05:50:17.896
UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE POTENTIAL

05:50:17.963 --> 05:50:19.865
LIFE EXPERIENCES ALL OF THE

05:50:19.932 --> 05:50:21.266
VICTIMS OR ALL OF THE

05:50:21.333 --> 05:50:28.240
DEFENDANT. HOW THE JUDICIAL

05:50:28.307 --> 05:50:32.478
COUNCIL ARE HAS A WORKING GROUP

05:50:32.544 --> 05:50:35.514
THAT HAS BEEN PUT TOGETHER UP

05:50:35.581 --> 05:50:38.484
WITH EXPERTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS

05:50:38.550 --> 05:50:40.018
THIS VERY PROBLEM BECAUSE I

05:50:40.085 --> 05:50:42.287
CERTAINLY AGREE THAT THERE IS

05:50:42.354 --> 05:50:44.390
BIAS IN OUR COURTS THERE IS

05:50:44.456 --> 05:50:46.258
BIAS IN LIFE IN OUR CORE TO

05:50:46.325 --> 05:50:49.361
REFLECTION OF LIFE AND TO GO

05:50:49.428 --> 05:50:52.197
OUT THERE AND TO TRY IN A JURY

05:50:52.264 --> 05:50:54.366
TRIAL TO PULL OUT IMPLICIT

05:50:54.433 --> 05:50:58.303
BIAS. IS PROBABLY GOING TO ADD

05:50:58.370 --> 05:51:00.005
WEEKS TO EACH JURY TRIAL. AND

05:51:00.072 --> 05:51:02.708
AT A TIME WHEN JUSTICE IS VERY

05:51:02.775 --> 05:51:04.510
HAS VIRTUALLY COME TO A HALT.

05:51:04.576 --> 05:51:05.911
WE'RE LOOKING AT YEARS OF

05:51:05.978 --> 05:51:08.180
BACKLOG EVEN TO TRY CASES EVEN

05:51:08.247 --> 05:51:10.349
TO TRY MISDEMEANOR CASES AND I

05:51:10.416 --> 05:51:11.984
MAY BE WRONG BUT I BELIEVE IN

05:51:12.050 --> 05:51:16.522
WASHINGTON. THIS WAS APPLIED

05:51:16.588 --> 05:51:18.390
FOR. CAPITAL CASES IF I'M NOT

05:51:18.457 --> 05:51:21.293
MISTAKEN AND YET IN CALIFORNIA

05:51:21.360 --> 05:51:21.894
WE'RE BRINGING IT DOWN TO THE

05:51:21.960 --> 05:51:24.530
VERY BASIC. THE CASE FOR

05:51:24.596 --> 05:51:26.432
MISDEMEANOR TRIALS THIS IS

05:51:26.498 --> 05:51:28.467
COMPLICATED STUFF THIS IS GOING

05:51:28.534 --> 05:51:30.636
INTO OUR COURT SYSTEM AND

05:51:30.702 --> 05:51:32.504
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO

05:51:32.571 --> 05:51:34.406
IDENTIFY AND ROOT OUT BIAS A

05:51:34.473 --> 05:51:37.342
VERY WORTHY CAUSE AND I COMMEND

05:51:37.409 --> 05:51:38.510
THE AUTHOR THIS BILL FOR HER

05:51:38.577 --> 05:51:40.112
PASSION AND HER COMMITMENT AND

05:51:40.179 --> 05:51:43.615
RIGHTEOUSNESS. IN THIS COST.

05:51:43.682 --> 05:51:45.884
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

05:51:45.951 --> 05:51:48.153
REALLY DOES REQUIRE. THAT

05:51:48.220 --> 05:51:50.122
PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL IN THE

05:51:50.189 --> 05:51:52.691
SYSTEM WHO UNDERSTAND WHO LEAVE

05:51:52.758 --> 05:51:54.793
THE SYSTEM WHO ARE TRYING TO

05:51:54.860 --> 05:51:56.862
SEE THAT JUSTICE IS DONE WORK

05:51:56.929 --> 05:51:58.597
TOGETHER IN FACT THREE YEARS

05:51:58.664 --> 05:52:00.098
AGO THE CHIEF JUSTICE CREATED A

05:52:00.165 --> 05:52:02.067
PRE TRIAL DETENTION REFORM WORK

05:52:02.134 --> 05:52:04.169
GROUP AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR

05:52:04.236 --> 05:52:07.339
THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB CAN.

05:52:07.406 --> 05:52:10.409
REPLACING CASH BAIL. NOW WE

05:52:10.476 --> 05:52:11.877
COULD SIT HERE AND TRY TO DO

05:52:11.944 --> 05:52:12.644
THAT BUT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW

05:52:12.711 --> 05:52:14.213
THE GUTS IN THE BOOK AND THE

05:52:14.279 --> 05:52:16.248
BOLTS OF A OF THE JUDICIAL

05:52:16.315 --> 05:52:18.350
SYSTEM WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT

05:52:18.417 --> 05:52:19.751
UNLESS THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE

05:52:19.818 --> 05:52:21.453
WHO HAVE BEEN PRACTICING LONG

05:52:21.520 --> 05:52:23.722
PICTURE REASON WHO KNOW EXACTLY

05:52:23.789 --> 05:52:25.257
WHAT GOES ON IN THE COURTROOM

05:52:25.324 --> 05:52:27.960
AND SO I WOULD SUGGEST IN ALL

05:52:28.026 --> 05:52:29.928
RIGHT. YOU KNOW I KNOW

05:52:29.995 --> 05:52:30.863
EVERYONE'S GOING TO DO WHAT

05:52:30.929 --> 05:52:31.997
THEY'RE GOING TO DO BUT THERE

05:52:32.064 --> 05:52:33.699
IS ANOTHER OPTION HERE. THERE

05:52:33.765 --> 05:52:36.602
IS THE JURY SELECTION WORK

05:52:36.668 --> 05:52:38.971
GROUP. THAT HAS BEEN FORMED TO

05:52:39.037 --> 05:52:41.006
STUDY THE COMPLICATED PROBLEMS

05:52:41.073 --> 05:52:42.875
ASSOCIATED WITH BIAS IN

05:52:42.941 --> 05:52:44.409
PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES TO

05:52:44.476 --> 05:52:46.278
PROSPECTIVE JURORS. WITH

05:52:46.345 --> 05:52:47.045
MEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN

05:52:47.112 --> 05:52:49.948
APPOINTED- I WOULD NOTE THAT I

05:52:50.015 --> 05:52:51.817
DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE

05:52:51.884 --> 05:52:53.986
JUDICIAL COUNCIL WENT NEUTRAL

05:52:54.052 --> 05:52:55.587
ON THIS BILL. THEY TOOK NO

05:52:55.654 --> 05:52:57.322
POSITION ON THIS BILL AND I

05:52:57.389 --> 05:52:58.690
THINK THAT'S A DISTINCTION THAT

05:52:58.757 --> 05:53:00.459
HAS TO BE DRAWN. BECAUSE THE

05:53:00.526 --> 05:53:03.161
COURTS FREQUENTLY SAY THIS IS

05:53:03.228 --> 05:53:06.164
NOT R. BAILEY WORK TO DECIDE

05:53:06.231 --> 05:53:09.067
POLICY. IT IS OUR- BAILEY WE'RE

05:53:09.134 --> 05:53:11.603
TO INTERPRET IT. AND SO I THINK

05:53:11.670 --> 05:53:13.805
THAT WE NEED TO BE CLEAR ON

05:53:13.872 --> 05:53:16.475
WHAT. THEY HAVE. AND WHAT THEY

05:53:16.542 --> 05:53:19.211
HAVE NOT. DONE WITH RESPECT TO

05:53:19.278 --> 05:53:21.346
THIS BILL- THE GOAL IS TO

05:53:21.413 --> 05:53:23.348
ENSURE FAIRNESS OF JURY POOLS

05:53:23.415 --> 05:53:25.484
IN THE JUDICIAL PROCESS. AND I

05:53:25.551 --> 05:53:27.686
WOULD SUBMIT. THAT IT WOULD BE

05:53:27.753 --> 05:53:30.222
MOST BENEFICIAL IT WOULD WORK

05:53:30.289 --> 05:53:32.157
TO THE BENEFIT OF EVERYONE WHO

05:53:32.224 --> 05:53:34.259
IS SEEKING. FAIRNESS AND

05:53:34.326 --> 05:53:35.928
IMPARTIALITY IN THE COURT

05:53:35.994 --> 05:53:38.063
SYSTEM TO LET THIS WORK GROUP

05:53:38.130 --> 05:53:39.398
COME UP WITH ITS

05:53:39.464 --> 05:53:41.600
RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THEN WITH

05:53:41.667 --> 05:53:43.735
THAT EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE

05:53:43.802 --> 05:53:45.437
AND COMMITMENT FOR JUSTICE

05:53:45.504 --> 05:53:47.773
WHICH I DO BELIEVE WE ARE

05:53:47.839 --> 05:53:48.574
STREET WE DO SEE IN OUR

05:53:48.640 --> 05:53:51.610
CURRENT- THE SUPREME COURT. AND

05:53:51.677 --> 05:53:54.713
JUDICIAL COUNCIL. THEN WE CAN

05:53:54.780 --> 05:53:57.282
MOVE AND DO IT RIGHT. AND DO IT

05:53:57.349 --> 05:53:59.418
WELL AND DO IT EFFECTIVELY. BUT

05:53:59.484 --> 05:54:00.919
I DO NOT BELIEVE AT THIS POINT

05:54:00.986 --> 05:54:02.721
IN TIME. THAT WE ARE IN A

05:54:02.788 --> 05:54:04.957
POSITION HERE TO MAKE THAT

05:54:05.023 --> 05:54:06.491
DECISION WITH THE INFORMATION

05:54:06.558 --> 05:54:08.694
THAT WE DO WE DO NOT HAVE. THE

05:54:08.760 --> 05:54:10.762
JUDICIAL PROCESS IS A VERY

05:54:10.829 --> 05:54:13.465
DELICATE ONE. IT IS A PROCESS

05:54:13.532 --> 05:54:16.602
NOT ALWAYS. A PRODUCT. BUT WE

05:54:16.668 --> 05:54:18.403
CAN MPROVE THEIR PROCESS AND I

05:54:18.470 --> 05:54:19.871
WOULD SUBMIT THAT THAT IS

05:54:19.938 --> 05:54:20.939
EXACTLY WHAT THE JUDICIAL

05:54:21.006 --> 05:54:23.875
COUNCIL. HAS SET UP TO DO. AND

05:54:23.942 --> 05:54:25.377
WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY

05:54:25.444 --> 05:54:29.114
ASK. THAT WE NOT MOVE THIS BILL

05:54:29.181 --> 05:54:29.681
FORWARD TODAY. YOU CENTER

05:54:29.748 --> 05:54:34.019
JACKSON SENATOR STERN. THANK

05:54:34.086 --> 05:54:38.056
YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. YEAH I

05:54:38.123 --> 05:54:39.257
WASN'T GOING TO GET UP AND

05:54:39.324 --> 05:54:42.561
SPEAK A- I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO

05:54:42.628 --> 05:54:43.195
MY HOMEWORK ON THIS LEGISLATION

05:54:43.261 --> 05:54:45.530
AND- SHE ATE THE COMPELLING

05:54:45.597 --> 05:54:48.533
REMARKS GIVEN- FROM THE CENTER

05:54:48.600 --> 05:54:49.134
FROM IRVINE AND SANTA BARBARA

05:54:49.201 --> 05:54:51.937
HERE I THINK THERE'S SOME

05:54:52.004 --> 05:54:53.839
COMPELLING ARGUMENTS AND TO BE

05:54:53.905 --> 05:54:55.641
HONEST I WRESTLED. MIGHTILY

05:54:55.707 --> 05:54:58.610
WITH THIS BILL- SPECIFICALLY

05:54:58.677 --> 05:54:59.244
BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE

05:54:59.311 --> 05:55:00.646
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE CENTER

05:55:00.712 --> 05:55:04.449
FROM IRVINE RAISED- I REPRESENT

05:55:04.516 --> 05:55:07.219
SEAMY VALLEY. AND I'D BE REMISS

05:55:07.285 --> 05:55:09.454
TO PASS ANY LEGISLATION. THAT

05:55:09.521 --> 05:55:11.690
LED ANOTHER RODNEY KING VERDICT

05:55:11.757 --> 05:55:15.394
BE MORE LIKELY. IT WAS DEEPLY

05:55:15.460 --> 05:55:17.796
CONCERNING TO ME THAT IN SOME

05:55:17.863 --> 05:55:20.999
WAYS WE WOULD HAND. OUR

05:55:21.066 --> 05:55:23.368
PROSECUTORS A DIFFERENT SET OF

05:55:23.435 --> 05:55:24.236
TOOLS SAVE IN OUR PUBLIC

05:55:24.302 --> 05:55:26.972
DEFENDERS AND INHIBIT OUR

05:55:27.039 --> 05:55:27.572
ABILITY TO GET MORE PEOPLE OF

05:55:27.639 --> 05:55:30.742
COLOR- WOMEN AND OTHER

05:55:30.809 --> 05:55:33.378
PROTECTED CLASSES ON THE JURY'S

05:55:33.445 --> 05:55:35.380
IN THE COURSE OF THE DILIGENCE

05:55:35.447 --> 05:55:37.649
ON THIS LEGISLATION NOW. AND

05:55:37.716 --> 05:55:39.217
GOING THROUGH IT WHAT WHAT I

05:55:39.284 --> 05:55:41.086
REALLY LEARNED IS THAT THIS

05:55:41.153 --> 05:55:44.489
BILL WILL HAVE. MAJOR IMPACT ON

05:55:44.556 --> 05:55:47.693
HOW DAZN PUBLIC DEFENDER'S DEAL

05:55:47.759 --> 05:55:48.827
WITH THEIR BOARD HEARING IN

05:55:48.894 --> 05:55:51.797
THESE CASES I DON'T THINK THE

05:55:51.863 --> 05:55:52.431
SPONSORS ARE THE AUTHOR DISPUTE

05:55:52.497 --> 05:55:55.734
THAT. BUT WHAT I EAT I'VE COME

05:55:55.801 --> 05:55:59.037
TO THE CONCLUSION IS THAT.

05:55:59.104 --> 05:56:00.572
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE MORE

05:56:00.639 --> 05:56:03.909
CREATIVE THAN SIMPLY USING RACE

05:56:03.975 --> 05:56:06.578
AS A FACTOR. WHEN YOU ARE DOING

05:56:06.645 --> 05:56:08.980
THOSE PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES IF

05:56:09.047 --> 05:56:10.949
YOU'RE PROSECUTING A HATE CRIME.

05:56:11.016 --> 05:56:12.317
OR IF YOU'RE PROSECUTING

05:56:12.384 --> 05:56:14.519
UNAUTHORIZED USE OF FORCE.

05:56:14.586 --> 05:56:15.687
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND SOME

05:56:15.754 --> 05:56:18.223
OTHER REASON TO BUMP THAT JUROR

05:56:18.290 --> 05:56:18.824
OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT THEY

05:56:18.890 --> 05:56:20.292
ARE WHITE. AND THAT'S A GOOD

05:56:20.358 --> 05:56:22.894
THING. WE SHOULDN'T BE

05:56:22.961 --> 05:56:24.496
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST JURORS

05:56:24.563 --> 05:56:25.697
BECAUSE THEY'RE WHITE AND WE

05:56:25.764 --> 05:56:27.699
ASSUME THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE

05:56:27.766 --> 05:56:29.801
JUST STANDING UP FOR SOMEONE

05:56:29.868 --> 05:56:31.136
WHO WOULD PERPETRATE HATE CRIME

05:56:31.203 --> 05:56:31.770
JUST LIKE WE SHOULD BE

05:56:31.837 --> 05:56:33.371
DISCRIMINATED JURORS BECAUSE

05:56:33.438 --> 05:56:33.905
THEY'RE BLACK OR THEY'RE A

05:56:33.972 --> 05:56:35.874
WOMAN. PEOPLE HAVE THEIR OWN

05:56:35.941 --> 05:56:39.711
INDEPENDENT JUDGMENTS. I THINK

05:56:39.778 --> 05:56:41.947
IT IS BILL STILL AFFORDS THOSE

05:56:42.013 --> 05:56:43.648
TOOLS OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES

05:56:43.715 --> 05:56:45.383
NOT JUST THE PROSECUTION BUT

05:56:45.450 --> 05:56:47.219
ALSO THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS NOW

05:56:47.285 --> 05:56:48.720
MIND YOU PUBLIC DEFENDERS UNDER

05:56:48.787 --> 05:56:50.956
THIS LEGISLATION ALSO WOULD BE

05:56:51.022 --> 05:56:53.792
BARRED FROM USING RACE AS A

05:56:53.859 --> 05:56:55.160
FACTOR IF THEY'RE PUSHING

05:56:55.227 --> 05:56:55.994
FORWARD OF A PEREMPTORY

05:56:56.061 --> 05:56:57.863
CHALLENGE. AND THAT THAT

05:56:57.929 --> 05:56:58.997
THRESHOLD WHAT THEY CALLED THE

05:56:59.064 --> 05:57:01.666
NOBLE REVIEW THAT'LL BE

05:57:01.733 --> 05:57:02.801
SCRUTINIZED VERY CAREFULLY. I

05:57:02.868 --> 05:57:04.803
THINK THE NET RESULTS MAY VERY

05:57:04.870 --> 05:57:07.672
WELL BE- THE PRESSURE BUILDS

05:57:07.739 --> 05:57:09.407
SUCH THAT. THE SUPREME COURT

05:57:09.474 --> 05:57:10.976
JUSTICE AND THAT COUNCIL THAT

05:57:11.042 --> 05:57:12.878
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE TODAY.

05:57:12.944 --> 05:57:14.713
AS A FIRE LIT UNDER THEM AND

05:57:14.780 --> 05:57:16.248
THAT THEY THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO

05:57:16.314 --> 05:57:18.683
HUSTLE UP. AND DO SOME WORK

05:57:18.750 --> 05:57:20.752
RIGHT NOW. I DON'T THINK WE CAN

05:57:20.819 --> 05:57:24.022
WAIT TILL TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO

05:57:24.089 --> 05:57:25.257
START MAKING JURIES MORE FAIR.

05:57:25.323 --> 05:57:28.560
I DON'T THINK WE CAN WAIT TILL

05:57:28.627 --> 05:57:29.094
TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO WORK

05:57:29.161 --> 05:57:30.562
THROUGH A SET OF GUIDELINES. I

05:57:30.629 --> 05:57:32.564
REALIZED THAT THIS BILL IS

05:57:32.631 --> 05:57:34.733
AGGRESSIVE. AND IT'S GOING TO

05:57:34.800 --> 05:57:37.335
FORCE CHANGE. BUT I'M I'M

05:57:37.402 --> 05:57:39.805
REALLY COMPELLED BY THIS MOMENT.

05:57:39.871 --> 05:57:41.106
AND REALIZING THAT THE

05:57:41.173 --> 05:57:43.809
JUDICIARY IS AN INCREDIBLY

05:57:43.875 --> 05:57:45.210
FUNCTIONAL IN CRITICAL BRANCH

05:57:45.277 --> 05:57:47.913
IS NOT BROKEN BUT IT IS OUR JOB

05:57:47.979 --> 05:57:49.881
TO STEP IN AND DECIDE THESE

05:57:49.948 --> 05:57:51.883
TOUGH POLICY QUESTIONS. WHETHER

05:57:51.950 --> 05:57:53.585
YOU'RE WHITE OR BLACK OR YOU'RE

05:57:53.652 --> 05:57:55.654
A WOMAN OR A MAN. I HAPPEN TO

05:57:55.720 --> 05:57:58.056
BE- A WHITE MAN AND I LIVE IN

05:57:58.123 --> 05:58:00.292
YOU KNOW CALABASAS. AND YET I

05:58:00.358 --> 05:58:02.627
STILL THINK THAT THERE ARE

05:58:02.694 --> 05:58:03.228
FUNDAMENTAL INJUSTICES IN THIS

05:58:03.295 --> 05:58:05.897
SYSTEM. THAT HAPPENED TO PEOPLE

05:58:05.964 --> 05:58:10.502
EVERY DAY. SO WHEN YOU VOTE ON

05:58:10.569 --> 05:58:13.205
THIS MEASURE NO THAT. YOU ARE

05:58:13.271 --> 05:58:14.372
GOING TO BE CAUSING A RIPPLE

05:58:14.439 --> 05:58:16.274
EFFECT IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM.

05:58:16.341 --> 05:58:17.909
DELAYS WILL PROSECUTE THEIR

05:58:17.976 --> 05:58:19.978
CASES DIFFERENTLY. AND THEY'LL

05:58:20.045 --> 05:58:22.948
STOP. AND THINK FOR A SECOND

05:58:23.014 --> 05:58:23.982
ABOUT HOW THEY'RE MAKING THAT

05:58:24.049 --> 05:58:26.184
ARGUMENT. AND THERE WILL BE A

05:58:26.251 --> 05:58:26.852
LOT OF SECOND GUESSING OF

05:58:26.918 --> 05:58:29.554
ONESELF. AND I THINK. THAT'S A

05:58:29.621 --> 05:58:33.024
GOOD THING. TO RECOGNIZE THAT

05:58:33.091 --> 05:58:35.594
PEOPLE HAVE IMPLICIT BIASES.

05:58:35.660 --> 05:58:36.761
AND IT TO REALLY WRESTLE WITH

05:58:36.828 --> 05:58:38.463
THAT AND TO LOOK OVER YOUR

05:58:38.530 --> 05:58:40.465
SHOULDER TO KNOW THAT THIS

05:58:40.532 --> 05:58:42.534
LEGISLATURE IS WATCHING. TO ME

05:58:42.601 --> 05:58:43.969
IS A CRITICAL FUNCTION AT THIS

05:58:44.035 --> 05:58:46.805
SPOT. NOT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH

05:58:46.872 --> 05:58:49.007
THAT INTERPRETS LAW. BUT THIS

05:58:49.074 --> 05:58:52.244
BODY DOES THE PEOPLE'S WILL HAS

05:58:52.310 --> 05:58:55.780
TO STEP IN AND LEAD ON. SO YOU

05:58:55.847 --> 05:58:58.016
KNOW WITH WITH THAT MUCH

05:58:58.083 --> 05:59:00.585
DILIGENCE AND- BUT TOUGH

05:59:00.652 --> 05:59:03.822
DELIBERATION PROCESS HERE I'M

05:59:03.889 --> 05:59:04.322
GONNA BE SUPPORTING THIS

05:59:04.389 --> 05:59:06.157
MEASURE TODAY. AND I THINK

05:59:06.224 --> 05:59:08.727
THAT. IF THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT

05:59:08.793 --> 05:59:10.295
IT DOESN'T WORK OR THE JUDICIAL

05:59:10.362 --> 05:59:12.497
COUNCIL STEPS IN OR THERE IS

05:59:12.564 --> 05:59:14.299
SOME NEW SET OF GUIDELINES. SO

05:59:14.366 --> 05:59:16.268
BE IT THEY CAN STEP IN AND WE

05:59:16.334 --> 05:59:18.436
CAN AMEND THIS LAW. BUT FOR

05:59:18.503 --> 05:59:19.671
RIGHT NOW I THINK WE CAN'T

05:59:19.738 --> 05:59:21.640
AFFORD TO WAIT YOUR AGENCY THIS

05:59:21.706 --> 05:59:23.408
MOMENT CALLS FOR IT WITHOUT A

05:59:23.475 --> 05:59:25.310
RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL.THANK

05:59:25.377 --> 05:59:26.511

YOU MR PRESIDENT. MY WIFE

05:59:39.057 --> 05:59:41.826
RECENTLY RELATED A PROFOUND AND

05:59:41.893 --> 05:59:43.828
FUNNY QUOTE THAT SHE HAD HEARD.

05:59:43.895 --> 05:59:46.665
AND IT WENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS

05:59:46.731 --> 05:59:50.468
MANY PEOPLE ARE JUDGMENTAL I

05:59:50.535 --> 05:59:52.070
CAN TELL JUST BY LOOKING AT

05:59:52.137 --> 05:59:55.573
THEM. AND SO I KIND OF

05:59:55.640 --> 05:59:57.042
APPRECIATE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS

05:59:57.108 --> 05:59:59.344
TO PICK JURORS. YEAH I AGREE

05:59:59.411 --> 06:00:01.012
WITH THE SENATORS FROM SANTA

06:00:05.050 --> 06:00:06.251
JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE

HAVE ANY CONFUSION BUT- I

06:00:12.290 --> 06:00:13.558
BELIEVE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL

06:00:13.625 --> 06:00:15.961
SHOULD FINISH THEIR WORK. AND I

06:00:16.027 --> 06:00:18.296
RECOMMEND A NO VOTE ON A. B.

06:00:18.363 --> 06:00:19.297
THIRTY SEVENTY THANK YOU MADAM

06:00:19.364 --> 06:00:20.999

YOU VERY MUCH AND APPRECIATE-

06:00:26.972 --> 06:00:29.641
BECAUSE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION

06:00:29.708 --> 06:00:30.241
HI I DIDN'T TEND TO SPEAK ON

06:00:30.308 --> 06:00:33.078
THIS BILL. EITHER BUT- I AM

06:00:33.144 --> 06:00:34.980
CONFLICTED ON THIS BILL AS A AS

06:00:35.046 --> 06:00:36.982
A LATINO KNOWING THAT PEOPLE OF

06:00:37.048 --> 06:00:39.084
COLOR GENERALLY OR ARE MORE APT

06:00:39.150 --> 06:00:41.586
TO BE REPRESENTED IN IN PRISON.

06:00:41.653 --> 06:00:45.223
THAN IN THE VOTING BOOTHS AND

06:00:45.290 --> 06:00:49.227
END OF CORPORATE AMERICA AND IN

06:00:49.294 --> 06:00:53.131
AREAS THAT- ARE. OF REFLECTIVE

06:00:53.198 --> 06:00:55.200
OF UNEQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO SEE

06:00:55.266 --> 06:00:57.469
YOU SUCCEED IN THIS COUNTRY. SO

06:00:57.535 --> 06:00:59.504
I WANTED TO SPEAK JUST TO

06:00:59.571 --> 06:01:03.675
EXPLAIN MY POSITION AND WHY I

06:01:03.742 --> 06:01:04.275
FEEL THIS BILL REALLY DOESN'T

06:01:04.342 --> 06:01:06.611
ADDRESS THE- I DON'T THINK EVEN

06:01:06.678 --> 06:01:09.347
AT ALL. THIS BILL DOESN'T

06:01:09.414 --> 06:01:14.085
GUARANTEE THAT A JURY HERE-

06:01:14.152 --> 06:01:16.287
INTERDIGITAL THIS PROCESS WILL

06:01:16.354 --> 06:01:19.791
BE SELECTED. THAT WILL PROVIDE

06:01:19.858 --> 06:01:23.128
A PERSON A JURY OF- THAT WILL

06:01:23.194 --> 06:01:24.329
WOULD BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE

06:01:24.396 --> 06:01:26.164
COMMUNITY WELL IT WOULD ADDRESS

06:01:26.231 --> 06:01:28.466
HOW ONE PERSON IN PARTICULAR

06:01:28.533 --> 06:01:30.435
COULD BE DISMISSED OR NOT IT

06:01:30.502 --> 06:01:33.705
DOESN'T GET TO- REQUIRING THAT

06:01:33.772 --> 06:01:35.907
A JURY SHOULD BE MADE UP OF A

06:01:35.974 --> 06:01:38.043
JURY OF OUR PEERS AND SO IN SO

06:01:38.109 --> 06:01:40.178
MANY CASES AND THERE AE SO

06:01:40.245 --> 06:01:41.613
MANY FACTORS THAT LEAD TO

06:01:41.679 --> 06:01:43.181
JURIES BEEN SELECTED THAT ARE

06:01:43.248 --> 06:01:45.283
NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR

06:01:45.350 --> 06:01:47.052
COMMUNITY. AND SO WHEN WE'RE

06:01:47.118 --> 06:01:49.020
TALKING ABOUT THE CHIEF JUSTICE

06:01:49.087 --> 06:01:50.488
UNDERTAKING A PROGRAM THAT WILL

06:01:50.555 --> 06:01:52.157
DO A COMPREHENSIVE CHANGE TO

06:01:52.223 --> 06:01:54.926
MAKE SURE THIS HAPPENS. I THINK

06:01:54.993 --> 06:01:56.294
WE'RE LOSING AN OPPORTUNITY

06:01:56.361 --> 06:01:58.296
HERE AS A LEGISLATURE TO

06:01:58.363 --> 06:02:00.098
INFLUENCE THAT DECISION MAKING

06:02:00.165 --> 06:02:03.635
PROCESS. AND TO SEND A BILL TO

06:02:03.701 --> 06:02:06.004
THE LOOK THE SUPREME COURT THAT

06:02:06.071 --> 06:02:08.139
WILL GUIDE THAT PROCESS AND

06:02:08.206 --> 06:02:11.342
HOPE THAT WE CAN. ADDRESS

06:02:11.409 --> 06:02:12.377
SEVERAL ISSUES THAT ARE

06:02:12.444 --> 06:02:15.780
IMPORTANT BUT- TO BE ADDRESSED

06:02:15.847 --> 06:02:17.315
IN ORDER THAT THAT CAN HAPPEN.

06:02:17.382 --> 06:02:19.350
AND THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS

06:02:19.417 --> 06:02:23.121
THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT. IDENTIFY

06:02:23.188 --> 06:02:25.590
THAT ARE RUCIAL BUT NEED TO BE

06:02:25.657 --> 06:02:28.159
ADDRESSED BEFORE WE CAN GET TO

06:02:28.226 --> 06:02:30.762
A SELECTING A JURY OF OUR PEERS

06:02:30.829 --> 06:02:33.231
ONE OF FIRST OF ALL IS HOW THE

06:02:33.298 --> 06:02:35.700
JURY POOL IS SELECTED- ONLY

06:02:35.767 --> 06:02:37.235
REGISTERED VOTERS AND WE KNOW

06:02:37.302 --> 06:02:39.070
THAT WITHIN THE AFRICAN

06:02:39.137 --> 06:02:40.638
AMERICAN LATINO COMMUNITY THERE

06:02:40.705 --> 06:02:42.707
ARE A LOT OF REGISTERED THERE

06:02:42.774 --> 06:02:43.575
ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR

06:02:43.641 --> 06:02:45.009
COMMUNITY ARE NOT REGISTERED TO

06:02:45.076 --> 06:02:47.612
VOTE AND THEREFORE BY PAST TO

06:02:47.679 --> 06:02:49.848
BE PROPER TO PARTICIPATE IN

06:02:49.914 --> 06:02:51.883
THIS PROCESS AND WHEN YOU GO TO

06:02:51.950 --> 06:02:55.753
A JURY A LOUNGE WHERE THE POOL

06:02:55.820 --> 06:02:57.956
IS SELECTED FROM YOU ALREADY

06:02:58.022 --> 06:02:59.691
SEE THAT YOU HAVE A POPULATION

06:02:59.757 --> 06:03:01.426
TO BEGIN WITH THAT'S NOT.

06:03:01.493 --> 06:03:03.394
REFLECTIVE OF THE COMMUNITY AND

06:03:03.461 --> 06:03:05.263
WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT AND

06:03:05.330 --> 06:03:06.931
ENSURE THAT EVERYONE IN AMERICA

06:03:06.998 --> 06:03:10.368
HAS AS A ELIGIBLE TO BE

06:03:10.435 --> 06:03:11.736
SELECTED TO SERVE. THE OTHER

06:03:11.803 --> 06:03:14.739
ISSUE. THAT IS VERY CRITICAL.

06:03:14.806 --> 06:03:17.809
IS THAT WHEN. BELOW ARE

06:03:17.876 --> 06:03:19.444
SELECTED. FULL OF COLOUR

06:03:19.511 --> 06:03:20.979
LATINOS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS

06:03:21.045 --> 06:03:24.182
TEND TO BE IN OCCUPATIONS THAT

06:03:24.249 --> 06:03:28.920
OF PROVIDE THEM UP ON. ALL OF A

06:03:28.987 --> 06:03:30.455
VERY HARD TIME TO BE ABLE TO

06:03:30.522 --> 06:03:31.756
SERVE BECAUSE THEY FIND

06:03:31.823 --> 06:03:34.025
THEMSELVES IN LOW WAGE JOBS AND

06:03:34.092 --> 06:03:36.828
SO THEY ARE MORE APT TO SELECT

06:03:36.895 --> 06:03:39.597
FINANCIAL HARDSHIP AS A REASON

06:03:39.664 --> 06:03:41.666
NOT TO SERVE AND COOK OUR

06:03:41.733 --> 06:03:43.968
CURRENT. PROCESS DOES NOT

06:03:44.035 --> 06:03:46.037
PROVIDE ANY ANY ANY PROTECTION

06:03:46.104 --> 06:03:49.374
OR OR COMPENSATION FOR A PEOPLE

06:03:49.440 --> 06:03:50.975
THAT ARE OF A VERY LOW ICOME

06:03:51.042 --> 06:03:53.344
MEANS SO ONLY REALLYIN OUR OUR

06:03:53.411 --> 06:03:55.613
CURRENT POOL WE HAVE PEOPLE

06:03:55.680 --> 06:03:57.215
THAT ARE IN EITHER MIDDLE CLASS

06:03:57.282 --> 06:03:58.917
OR ABOVE MIDDLE CLASS. THERE

06:03:58.983 --> 06:04:00.685
ARE OTHER ELIGIBLE TO SERVE IN

06:04:00.752 --> 06:04:04.389
THAT ALSO NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED

06:04:04.455 --> 06:04:07.492
SO YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THAT

06:04:07.559 --> 06:04:09.360
WE'RE WORKING IN THIS AREA IT

06:04:09.427 --> 06:04:11.196
IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT I THINK

06:04:11.262 --> 06:04:12.330
LIKE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE I

06:04:12.397 --> 06:04:14.499
THINK. OTHER AREAS NEED TO BE

06:04:14.566 --> 06:04:16.668
ADDRESSED I DON'T UNDERSTAND

06:04:16.734 --> 06:04:18.703
WHY. PEOPLE THINK THAT BY ONLY

06:04:18.770 --> 06:04:20.605
TWEAKING THIS ONE AREA THAT YOU

06:04:20.672 --> 06:04:21.606
YOU'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE

06:04:21.673 --> 06:04:23.441
PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT. AND

06:04:23.508 --> 06:04:25.443
IT COULD POSSIBLY CREATE A

06:04:25.510 --> 06:04:27.078
CHALLENGE IN CREATING A

06:04:27.145 --> 06:04:29.447
COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION BY A

06:04:29.514 --> 06:04:31.516
TWEAKING THIS IN PARTICULAR MAY

06:04:31.583 --> 06:04:33.184
CREATE CHALLENGES TO.

06:04:33.251 --> 06:04:37.322
ADDRESSING OTHER ISSUES SO.

06:04:37.388 --> 06:04:38.122
WITH ITS WITH A HEAVY HEART

06:04:38.189 --> 06:04:40.558
THAT I WILL I'LL STAY OFF FOR

06:04:40.625 --> 06:04:42.594
THIS MEASURE NOW AND HOPE THAT-

06:04:42.660 --> 06:04:44.429
THE CHIEF JUSTICE CAN CONVENE A

06:04:44.495 --> 06:04:46.497
PROCESS THAT WILL COME UP WITH

06:04:46.564 --> 06:04:48.433
RECOMMENDATIONS AND MANY OF

06:04:48.499 --> 06:04:50.735
THEM MIGHT REQUIRE. LEGISLATION

06:04:50.802 --> 06:04:53.171
TO ADOPT THEM AND MAYBE WE CAN-

06:04:53.238 --> 06:04:54.405
SUPPORT A PROGRAM THAT WILL

06:04:54.472 --> 06:04:56.541
GET. MORE PEOPLE ELIGIBLE TO

06:04:56.608 --> 06:04:57.809
SERVE BY BY GIVING THEM SOME

06:04:57.875 --> 06:04:59.777
KIND OF FINANCIAL COMPENSATION

06:04:59.844 --> 06:05:01.512
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE PEOPLE

06:05:01.579 --> 06:05:03.248
THAT WOULD- BE HARMED

06:05:03.314 --> 06:05:04.716
FINANCIALLY IF THEY SERVE IN

06:05:04.782 --> 06:05:06.017
OUR SYSTEM AND THAT'S SOMETHING

06:05:06.084 --> 06:05:07.752
WE NEED TO ADDRESS. AND FOR

06:05:07.819 --> 06:05:10.922
THAT HI I. AM VERY SAD NOT TO

06:05:10.989 --> 06:05:11.723
BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY I

06:05:11.789 --> 06:05:13.191
THINK YOU SENT AWAY SO SEEING

06:05:13.258 --> 06:05:14.926
NO HANDS RAISED AND A FURTHER

06:05:14.993 --> 06:05:17.795

PRESIDENT AND IT'S THIS IS A

06:05:25.370 --> 06:05:27.071
GOOD ONE TO SHOW THAT EVERYONE

IS STILL VERY- ALERT AFTER A

06:05:29.540 --> 06:05:31.075
LONG DAY AND PAYING ATTENTION

COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF

06:05:38.283 --> 06:05:38.983
THIS ISSUE FOR A VERY

06:05:39.050 --> 06:05:42.987
THOUGHTFUL. COMMENTS AND I CAN

06:05:43.054 --> 06:05:45.723
SAY THAT- AS A TRIAL ATTORNEY

06:05:45.790 --> 06:05:47.258
MYSELF WE TRIED QUITE A FEW

06:05:47.325 --> 06:05:49.994
CASES- YOU KNOW I'VE HAD MY OWN

06:05:50.061 --> 06:05:51.596
OPINIONS ABOUT JURY SELECTION

06:05:51.663 --> 06:05:53.598
OVER TIME- BUT I KNOW THE

06:05:53.665 --> 06:05:55.600
FUNDAMENTALLY THIS BILL IS

06:05:55.667 --> 06:05:57.702
ABOUT SOLVING WERE MAKING

06:05:57.769 --> 06:05:59.671
PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING A VERY

06:05:59.737 --> 06:06:01.272
REAL PROBLEM THAT WE FACE WHICH

06:06:01.339 --> 06:06:02.740
IS RACIAL BIAS IN OUR JURY

06:06:02.807 --> 06:06:04.575
SELECTION PROCESS. I WANT TO

06:06:04.642 --> 06:06:06.177
ELECT OR ELECT I WANT TO

06:06:06.244 --> 06:06:08.579
ADDRESS A FEW FACTUAL

06:06:08.646 --> 06:06:09.781
STATEMENTS THAT WERE MADE JUST

06:06:09.847 --> 06:06:11.449
TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE SAME

06:06:11.516 --> 06:06:14.185
PAGE ON A VISIT AS THE CENTER

06:06:14.252 --> 06:06:15.687
OF SANTA BARBARA MENTIONED

06:06:15.753 --> 06:06:16.688
SHE'S CORRECT THE JUDICIAL

06:06:16.754 --> 06:06:19.057
COUNCIL SENT A LETTER SAYING

06:06:19.123 --> 06:06:20.024
THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE A

06:06:20.091 --> 06:06:22.093
POSITION ON THIS BILL. AND WHAT

06:06:22.160 --> 06:06:25.596
THE JUDICIAL. COUNCIL SAID AT

06:06:25.663 --> 06:06:27.598
THE END OF ITS LETTER. I WAS. I

06:06:27.665 --> 06:06:28.733
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAS NO

06:06:28.800 --> 06:06:30.668
POSITION ON A. B. THIRTY SEVEN

06:06:30.735 --> 06:06:32.236
B. AS IT BELIEVES THAT THE

06:06:32.303 --> 06:06:33.838
PROPOSED CHANGES TO PEREMPTORY

06:06:33.905 --> 06:06:36.574
CHALLENGES OR A POLICY CALL

06:06:36.641 --> 06:06:38.376
WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE

06:06:38.443 --> 06:06:41.612
LEGISLATURE. WE ARE THE POLICY

06:06:41.679 --> 06:06:43.414
MAKING BODY FOR THE STATE OF

06:06:43.481 --> 06:06:46.918
CALIFORNIA. WE SET THE RULES

06:06:46.984 --> 06:06:48.920
AND THE COURTS APPLY THOSE

06:06:48.986 --> 06:06:52.924
RULES. AND I DON'T THINK IT IS

06:06:52.990 --> 06:06:55.560
A SOUND ARGUMENT O SAY THAT

06:06:55.626 --> 06:06:57.762
FOR SOMETHING AS FUNDAMENTAL AS

06:06:57.829 --> 06:07:00.164
FUNDAMENTAL THAT PEOPLE SHOULD

06:07:00.231 --> 06:07:02.533
HAVE A FAIR JURY AND THE JURY

06:07:02.600 --> 06:07:03.735
SELECTION SHOULD NOT BE

06:07:03.801 --> 06:07:05.603
RACIALLY BIASED. THAT IS

06:07:05.670 --> 06:07:07.605
ABSOLUTELY NOT JUST WITHIN THE

06:07:07.672 --> 06:07:09.440
PURVIEW OF THE LEGISLATURE IT

06:07:09.507 --> 06:07:12.110
IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO

06:07:12.176 --> 06:07:14.579
ADDRESS A- THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL

06:07:14.645 --> 06:07:16.247
CAME FORWARD WITH DOZENS OF

06:07:16.314 --> 06:07:18.983
AMENDMENTS. THE SPONSORS OF

06:07:19.050 --> 06:07:20.351
THIS BILL IN THE AUTHORS SPEND

06:07:20.418 --> 06:07:22.553
WEEKS WORKING WITH THE JUDICIAL

06:07:22.620 --> 06:07:24.389
COUNCIL AND TOOK AMENDMENTS

06:07:24.455 --> 06:07:26.557
THEY PROVIDED TECHNICAL

06:07:26.624 --> 06:07:27.158
ASSISTANCE AND AMENDMENTS WERE

06:07:27.225 --> 06:07:29.694
TAKEN. THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES

06:07:29.761 --> 06:07:32.296
ASSOCIATION PROVIDED NUMEROUS

06:07:32.363 --> 06:07:33.664
AMENDMENTS AND ALL OF THOSE

06:07:33.731 --> 06:07:35.333
AMENDMENTS EXCEPT FOR ONE WERE

06:07:35.400 --> 06:07:38.236
TAKEN. THE AFRICAN AMERICAN

06:07:38.302 --> 06:07:40.338
JUDGES ISSUED A NEGATIVE LETTER

06:07:40.405 --> 06:07:42.874
AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY WITHDREW

06:07:42.940 --> 06:07:45.643
THAT LETTER. THIS BILL THE

06:07:45.710 --> 06:07:47.612
IMPLEMENTATION WAS DELAYED

06:07:47.678 --> 06:07:49.881
UNTIL JANUARY FIRST TWENTY

06:07:49.947 --> 06:07:50.415
TWENTY TWO WAS ORIGINALLY

06:07:50.481 --> 06:07:52.750
JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY

06:07:52.817 --> 06:07:54.318
ONE. AND THE REASON IT WAS

06:07:54.385 --> 06:07:56.020
DELAYED WAS BECAUSE THE JUDGES

06:07:56.087 --> 06:07:57.955
CAME FORWARD AND SAID WE HAVE

06:07:58.022 --> 06:08:00.191
SOME TRAINING TO DO WE WANT TO

06:08:00.258 --> 06:08:01.125
MAKE SURE THAT WE IMPLEMENT IT

06:08:01.192 --> 06:08:03.161
WELL AND SO THE AUTHOR DR

06:08:03.227 --> 06:08:05.029
WEBBER AGREED TO A ONE YEAR

06:08:05.096 --> 06:08:06.931
DELAY IN IMPLEMENTATION AT THE

06:08:06.998 --> 06:08:09.167
REQUEST OF THE JUDGES SO THAT

06:08:09.233 --> 06:08:10.935
THEY COULD BE PROPERLY TRAINED

06:08:11.002 --> 06:08:12.003
AND THAT WAS AN APPROPRIATE

06:08:12.069 --> 06:08:13.604
DECISION. BUT I DON'T THINK

06:08:13.671 --> 06:08:15.606
THAT THAT MEANS THAT WELL LET'S

06:08:15.673 --> 06:08:17.809
NOT GO INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY

06:08:17.875 --> 06:08:18.376
TWENTY TWENTY TWO ANYWAY SO

06:08:18.443 --> 06:08:21.145
DON'T DO THE BILL I JUST DON'T

06:08:21.212 --> 06:08:23.247
AGREE. WITH THAT WASHINGTON

06:08:23.314 --> 06:08:25.082
STATE AND THE SENATOR FROM

06:08:25.149 --> 06:08:26.184
ORANGE COUNTY MENTIONED THE

06:08:26.250 --> 06:08:29.320
WASHINGTON STATE- GENERAL

06:08:29.387 --> 06:08:31.489
THIRTY SEVEN. AND I. WILL NOT

06:08:31.556 --> 06:08:33.724
IT'S NOT IDENTICAL TO THIRTY

06:08:33.791 --> 06:08:35.226
SEVENTY BUT IT HAS MANY OF THE

06:08:35.293 --> 06:08:37.895
SAME DOCTORS. TALKING ABOUT-

06:08:37.962 --> 06:08:39.997
WITH THAT JUROR IS INATTENTIVE

06:08:40.064 --> 06:08:42.333
OR HAS A BAD ATTITUDE. SO

06:08:42.400 --> 06:08:44.535
THAT'S MY REAL JUSTIFICATION.

06:08:44.602 --> 06:08:47.104
FOR STRIKING. JUROR ALL THOSE

06:08:47.171 --> 06:08:49.507
KINDS OF THINGS ARE IN GENERAL

06:08:49.574 --> 06:08:50.641
RULE THIRTY SEVEN FROM

06:08:50.708 --> 06:08:52.109
WASHINGTON STATE. WE GOT A

06:08:52.176 --> 06:08:55.112
LETTER. FROM JUSTICE GONZALEZ

06:08:55.179 --> 06:08:55.646
FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF

06:08:55.713 --> 06:08:58.349
WASHINGTON AND JUST AS YOU DO.

06:08:58.416 --> 06:09:03.254
ON A BASICALLY THANKING

06:09:03.321 --> 06:09:03.955
CALIFORNIA FOR REACHING OUT.

06:09:04.021 --> 06:09:06.724
AND IT ENDS BY SAYING WE HOPE

06:09:06.791 --> 06:09:08.125
OTHER STATES WILL JOIN OUR

06:09:08.192 --> 06:09:09.760
EFFORTS IN ADDRESSING BIAS IN

06:09:09.827 --> 06:09:11.395
JURY SELECTION. AND LOOK

06:09:11.462 --> 06:09:13.297
FORWARD TO HEARING MORE ABOUT

06:09:13.364 --> 06:09:15.399
YOUR WORK THERE'S NOTHING IN

06:09:15.466 --> 06:09:16.767
THIS LETTER THAT WAS ANYTHING

06:09:16.834 --> 06:09:18.302
OTHER THAN POSITIVE ABOUT THE

06:09:18.369 --> 06:09:20.738
FACT THAT CALIFORNIA. WAS GOING

06:09:20.805 --> 06:09:23.207
TO BE JOINING WASHINGTON STATE

06:09:23.274 --> 06:09:25.376
AND TAKING AGGRESSIVE STEPS TO

06:09:25.443 --> 06:09:27.745
ADDRESS RACIAL DISCRIMINATION

06:09:27.812 --> 06:09:31.249
AND THE SELECTION. OF JURIES.

06:09:31.315 --> 06:09:32.984
WELL WE HEARD A NUMBER OF

06:09:33.050 --> 06:09:35.853
ARGUMENTS TODAY COLLEAGUES THAT

06:09:35.920 --> 06:09:38.189
WE SHOULD DELAY THIS. WHICH ARE

06:09:38.256 --> 06:09:39.457
THE LATEST FOR ALL SORTS OF

06:09:39.524 --> 06:09:40.925
REASONS AND I BET YOU CAN

06:09:40.992 --> 06:09:42.760
WANDER AROUND THIS ROOM EVERY

06:09:42.827 --> 06:09:44.929
SINGLE ONE OF YOU COLLEAGUE HAS

06:09:44.996 --> 06:09:46.597
HEARD THAT ABOUT ONE OR MANY OF

06:09:46.664 --> 06:09:49.433
YOUR BILLS. WE SHOULD ESTABLISH

06:09:49.500 --> 06:09:51.302
A WORKING GROUP. BEFORE WE DO

06:09:51.369 --> 06:09:54.272
YOUR BILL. WE HAVE TO HAVE A

06:09:54.338 --> 06:09:55.473
COMPLETELY COMPREHENSIVE

06:09:55.540 --> 06:09:58.209
SOLUTION THAT SOLVES EVERYTHING

06:09:58.276 --> 06:10:01.212
OR WE CAN SOLVE ONE PIECE OF IT.

06:10:01.279 --> 06:10:02.947
WHEN WE KNOW THAT IT IS SO RARE

06:10:03.014 --> 06:10:04.215
THAT WE WOULD EVER HAVE A

06:10:04.282 --> 06:10:05.783
COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION IT'S THE

06:10:05.850 --> 06:10:07.385
WAY OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS

06:10:07.451 --> 06:10:10.521
YOU SOLVE PIECES OF A PROBLEM

06:10:10.588 --> 06:10:12.857
UNTIL YOU SAW. THE WHOLE THING.

06:10:12.924 --> 06:10:15.426
ON THAT WE SHOULD AND FROM

06:10:15.493 --> 06:10:16.294
THREE CHALLENGES AND I AGREE

06:10:16.360 --> 06:10:17.728
WITH THE CENTER OF OUR COUNTY

06:10:17.795 --> 06:10:19.297
THERE'S A GOOD ARGUMENT FOR

06:10:19.363 --> 06:10:20.731
DOING THAT AND THAT'S A BILL

06:10:20.798 --> 06:10:21.332
THAT I WOULD BE OPEN TO

06:10:21.399 --> 06:10:24.235
SUPPORTING. I DON'T RECALL THAT

06:10:24.302 --> 06:10:25.870
BILL. BEING PROPOSED WHAT I DO

06:10:25.937 --> 06:10:28.806
RECALL IS THAT THE SENATOR FROM

06:10:28.873 --> 06:10:30.474
SANTA BARBARA. INTRODUCED A

06:10:30.541 --> 06:10:32.209
BILL THAT I SUPPORTED THAT

06:10:32.276 --> 06:10:35.046
REDUCED. OR EXTENDED THE

06:10:35.112 --> 06:10:35.546
REDUCTION OF PEREMPTORY

06:10:35.613 --> 06:10:38.549
CHALLENGES. THAT BILL WAS WORLD

06:10:38.616 --> 06:10:41.519
WAR THREE. AND IF WE WERE TO

06:10:41.586 --> 06:10:42.987
HAVE A BILL TO AND FROM THREE

06:10:43.054 --> 06:10:44.722
CHALLENGES MY CONFIDENCE LEVEL

06:10:44.789 --> 06:10:46.958
THAT THAT BILL WOULD PASS IS

06:10:47.024 --> 06:10:49.460
SOMETHING CLOSE TO ZERO BECAUSE

06:10:49.527 --> 06:10:51.762
EVERYONE ALL SIDES OF THE BAR

06:10:51.829 --> 06:10:53.764
WILL COME OUT FULL GUNS BLAZING

06:10:53.831 --> 06:10:54.966
BECAUSE THEY ALL LOVE TO HAVE

06:10:55.032 --> 06:10:56.867
PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES. BECAUSE

06:10:56.934 --> 06:10:58.202
IT MEANS YOU CAN GET RID OF THE

06:10:58.269 --> 06:10:59.770
PEOPLE YOU DON'T LIKE EVEN IF

06:10:59.837 --> 06:11:02.673
YOU HAVE IMPLICIT BIAS EVEN IF

06:11:02.740 --> 06:11:04.342
YOU DON'T REALIZE THAT THE

06:11:04.408 --> 06:11:06.310
REASON YOU'RE STRIKING SOMEONE

06:11:06.377 --> 06:11:08.579
IS BECAUSE OF RACE AND THAT'S

06:11:08.646 --> 06:11:09.614
WHY THE PART OF THIS BILL THAT

06:11:09.680 --> 06:11:10.715
SAYS IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR

06:11:10.781 --> 06:11:12.383
SUBJECTIVE INTENT. YOU DON'T

06:11:12.450 --> 06:11:14.285
HAVE TO BE A BAD PERSON FOR THE

06:11:14.352 --> 06:11:15.720
PEREMPTORY TO BE RACIALLY

06:11:15.786 --> 06:11:17.989
BIASED IT SAYS HAS TO BE THAT

06:11:18.055 --> 06:11:21.325
WAY OBJECTIVELY REGARDLESS OF

06:11:21.392 --> 06:11:21.926
WHETHER YOU WERE BEING

06:11:21.993 --> 06:11:23.794
MALICIOUS. I'M CONCERNED BASED

06:11:23.861 --> 06:11:26.163
ON THE DEBATE TODAY BUT WHAT WE

06:11:26.230 --> 06:11:26.931
WILL SEE IF THIS BILL WAS

06:11:26.998 --> 06:11:28.833
REJECTED IT'S UNCLEAR THAT

06:11:28.899 --> 06:11:31.235
ANYTHING WILL HAPPEN. I HAVEN'T

06:11:31.302 --> 06:11:32.837
SEEN A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THE

06:11:32.903 --> 06:11:33.938
CHIEF JUSTICE IS WORKING

06:11:34.005 --> 06:11:35.506
WITHOUT A CRITICISM I LOVE IT

06:11:35.573 --> 06:11:37.608
SHE JUST SAYS WHAT THE GUY WHO

06:11:37.675 --> 06:11:38.909
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S

06:11:38.976 --> 06:11:43.080
GOING TO TAKE IT AGAIN. THEY

06:11:43.147 --> 06:11:45.082
ARE NOT THE LEGISLATURE. SO

06:11:45.149 --> 06:11:47.018
THIS IS A REAL ISSUE RIGHT NOW.

06:11:47.084 --> 06:11:49.053
COLLEGE THIS IS NOT LIKE A NEW

06:11:49.120 --> 06:11:51.155
PROBLEM THAT'S ARISEN AND WE

06:11:51.222 --> 06:11:52.790
HAVE TO LIKE STEP BACK. AND DO

06:11:52.857 --> 06:11:54.892
A WORKING GROUP. AND FIGURE IT

06:11:54.959 --> 06:11:56.093
OUT AND COME UP WITH A

06:11:56.160 --> 06:11:58.929
COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION. THIS IS

06:11:58.996 --> 06:11:59.563
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING

06:11:59.630 --> 06:12:02.466
FOREVER. IT AFFECTS A CERTAIN

06:12:02.533 --> 06:12:04.335
ASPECT OF OUR COMMUNITY

06:12:04.402 --> 06:12:06.637
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. FAR MORE

06:12:06.704 --> 06:12:09.473
THAN ANY OTHERS IT IS LEADING

06:12:09.540 --> 06:12:10.307
TO AN UNFAIR CRIMINAL JUSTICE

06:12:10.374 --> 06:12:14.612
SYSTEM. IT IS PERPETUATING

06:12:14.679 --> 06:12:15.212
STRUCTURAL RACISM IN OUR CRIB

06:12:15.279 --> 06:12:16.781
JUSTICE. AND WE HAVE AN

06:12:16.847 --> 06:12:18.649
OPPORTUNITY TO FIX IT I WILL

06:12:18.716 --> 06:12:20.551
AND COLLEAGUES WERE TALKING

06:12:20.618 --> 06:12:22.420
ABOUT SORT OF THE BOTTOM LINE.

06:12:22.486 --> 06:12:24.355
YES I AGREE THIS IS VERY

06:12:24.422 --> 06:12:26.390
DIFFERENT. THIS IS A REALLY

06:12:26.457 --> 06:12:28.592
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WHEN I FIRST

06:12:28.659 --> 06:12:29.894
SAW THIS BILL BECAUSE IT CAME

06:12:29.960 --> 06:12:31.262
THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE

06:12:31.328 --> 06:12:33.164
WHEN I FIRST READ IT. I'LL BE

06:12:33.230 --> 06:12:34.999
HONEST I HAD A REACTION LIKE

06:12:35.066 --> 06:12:36.634
WHOA WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS

06:12:36.701 --> 06:12:39.570
SOMEONE WHO IS EXERCISE

06:12:39.637 --> 06:12:40.404
PRINTERS HALOGEN PICK JURIES.

06:12:40.471 --> 06:12:42.106
AND THAT IS BECAUSE IT IS

06:12:42.173 --> 06:12:44.608
DIFFERENT. YES IT'S DIFFERENT

06:12:44.675 --> 06:12:46.677
THAN LEGAL TRADITION. BUT

06:12:46.744 --> 06:12:48.245
THAT'S A GOOD THING LEGAL

06:12:48.312 --> 06:12:50.548
TRADITION IN THIS COUNTRY HAS

06:12:50.614 --> 06:12:52.583
RESULTED IN A RACIST CRIMINAL

06:12:52.650 --> 06:12:55.152
JUSTICE SYSTEM AND WE NEED TO

06:12:55.219 --> 06:12:57.755
EXTIRPATE THAT RACISM I'M PART

06:12:57.822 --> 06:12:58.923
OF IT IS CHANGING HOW WE PICK

06:12:58.989 --> 06:13:00.758
JURIES LET'S GET OUT OF OUR

06:13:00.825 --> 06:13:02.460
COMFORT ZONE. LET'S TRY

06:13:02.526 --> 06:13:03.794

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE

06:47:57.252 --> 06:48:01.089
I ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT THIS.

06:48:01.156 --> 06:48:05.961
EXPEDITED REVIEW BUILT. IT'S A

06:48:06.028 --> 06:48:10.532
VERY CRITICAL. NEED TO MAINTAIN

06:48:10.599 --> 06:48:13.535
AND IMPROVE. OUR DAMS IN

06:48:13.602 --> 06:48:17.239
CALIFORNIA. THAT CERTAINLY CAME

06:48:17.306 --> 06:48:19.074
TO MY ATTENTION WHEN THE

06:48:19.141 --> 06:48:21.009
ORVILLE SPELL AWAY HAD A

06:48:21.076 --> 06:48:25.414
FAILURE. NOW THAT IS A VERY

06:48:25.480 --> 06:48:29.418
LARGE DAM IT'S C. HEART OF THE

06:48:29.484 --> 06:48:33.222
STATE WATER PROJECT. BUT WHAT

06:48:33.288 --> 06:48:35.224
WE DID LEARN IS OVER THE

06:48:35.290 --> 06:48:38.961
DECADES. NOT NEAR ENOUGH

06:48:39.027 --> 06:48:40.829
ATTENTION HAD BEEN PAID. THAT

06:48:40.896 --> 06:48:45.100
MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR AND

06:48:45.167 --> 06:48:48.737
SUSTAINING THE SITE. NOW IN OUR

06:48:48.804 --> 06:48:50.973
PART WE DID NOT HAVE. THE

06:48:51.039 --> 06:48:52.841
CONCERN OF THE SAN ANDREAS

06:48:52.908 --> 06:49:00.649
FAULT. BUT THAT IS A HUGE THERE.

06:49:00.716 --> 06:49:02.551
AND WHEN THESE DAMS ARE

06:49:02.618 --> 06:49:06.388
COMPROMISED. THE FAILURE CAN BE

06:49:06.455 --> 06:49:10.025
DEVASTATING. A GOOD FRIEND THE

06:49:10.092 --> 06:49:12.060
AUTHOR FROM THERE HAS

06:49:12.127 --> 06:49:14.730
ACKNOWLEDGED WHAT THAT IMPACT

06:49:14.796 --> 06:49:16.732
WOULD BE HOW FAR THAT WATER

06:49:16.798 --> 06:49:18.834
WOULD GO HOW DESTRUCTIVE IT

06:49:18.901 --> 06:49:21.803
WOULD LEAD TO THE ECONOMY OF

06:49:21.870 --> 06:49:25.974
THAT VERY HEALTHY REGION. AND

06:49:26.041 --> 06:49:28.977
ALSO THE LIVES. THAT COULD BE

06:49:29.044 --> 06:49:33.582
COMPROMISED. OR WILL HAPPEN WE

06:49:33.649 --> 06:49:36.318
HAD TO EVACUATE A HUNDRED AND

06:49:36.385 --> 06:49:38.120
EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE.

06:49:38.186 --> 06:49:40.255
THIS WOULD NOT REQUIRE SUCH BUT

06:49:40.322 --> 06:49:42.491
LET'S NOT GET TO THAT POINT.

06:49:42.557 --> 06:49:43.825
THE POINT IS DIFFERENT

06:49:43.892 --> 06:49:47.362
JURISDICTIONS. OVER DAMS AND

06:49:47.429 --> 06:49:48.864
THERE IS A DEGREE STATUTE DAM

06:49:48.931 --> 06:49:50.999
INSPECTION SYSTEMS THAT ARE ON

06:49:51.066 --> 06:49:57.806
STATE. BUT. FOR WHAT MANY

06:49:57.873 --> 06:49:59.408
REASONS. SOME THE INSPECTION

06:49:59.474 --> 06:50:01.743
SOMETIMES THE REPAIRS FOUND IN

06:50:01.810 --> 06:50:04.546
THOSE INSPECTIONS. HAS BEEN

06:50:04.613 --> 06:50:07.649
NEGLECTED HERE I THINK IT'S

06:50:07.716 --> 06:50:09.351
BEEN PRETTY WELL DETERMINE WHAT

06:50:09.418 --> 06:50:11.453
NOW NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND

06:50:11.520 --> 06:50:17.459
THEREFORE WE MUST GET A BALLOT.

06:50:17.526 --> 06:50:18.093
FOR THOSE OF YOU IN OTHER PARTS

06:50:18.160 --> 06:50:19.861
OF THE STATE. WE COULDN'T ARGUE

06:50:19.928 --> 06:50:21.563
MUCH THAT THE STATE WATER

06:50:21.630 --> 06:50:23.432
PROJECT IN OUR BILL DOES NOT

06:50:23.498 --> 06:50:26.068
AFFECT YOU. DOES IT DOES AFFECT

06:50:26.134 --> 06:50:28.837
MOST OF THE STATE. THIS IS MORE

06:50:28.904 --> 06:50:31.807
LOCALIZED BUT OF NO LESS

06:50:31.873 --> 06:50:32.374
SIGNIFICANT. TO ALL OF THE

06:50:32.441 --> 06:50:36.945
PEOPLE. WHO INHABIT THAT AREA.

06:50:37.012 --> 06:50:38.914
AND BENEFIT FROM THE DROP WATER

06:50:38.981 --> 06:50:43.685
DERIVING FROM THAT CRITICAL DAM.

06:50:43.752 --> 06:50:44.820
I DON'T VIEW THIS IS

06:50:44.886 --> 06:50:46.254
COMPROMISING ANY THE

06:50:46.321 --> 06:50:50.492
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPERATIVES. BUT

06:50:50.559 --> 06:50:52.361
IT CERTAINLY DOES BALANCE THOSE

06:50:52.427 --> 06:50:56.098
WITH. THE PUBLIC SAFETY

06:50:56.164 --> 06:50:59.001
IMPERATIVES THE NEED OF THE

06:50:59.067 --> 06:51:01.737
CITIZENS FOR THE WATER WHATEVER

06:51:01.803 --> 06:51:04.306
THE USE IS AN ABSOLUTE CRITICAL

06:51:04.373 --> 06:51:07.442
NEED TO PROTECT THEM FROM A

06:51:07.509 --> 06:51:10.746
FAILURE OF THAT. SO IF YOU LOOK

06:51:10.812 --> 06:51:13.048
AT YOUR OWN AREA DON'T JUST SAY

06:51:13.115 --> 06:51:14.649
WELL THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM. IT

06:51:14.716 --> 06:51:18.520
REALLY ISN'T. THE WATER IS

06:51:18.587 --> 06:51:20.055
NEEDED THE STATE COULD HAVE

06:51:20.122 --> 06:51:22.491
NEVER GROWN. WITHOUT THE

06:51:22.557 --> 06:51:24.493
IMPOUNDMENT OF WATER. AROUND

06:51:24.559 --> 06:51:28.930
CALIFORNIA AND WE WOULD HAVE

06:51:28.997 --> 06:51:30.866
HAD MANY JONESTOWN FLOODS. OVER

06:51:30.932 --> 06:51:34.536

CENTER PORCHES. IT'S HARD NOT

08:49:40.515 --> 08:49:43.318
TO BE A LITTLE CYNICAL. AS THIS

08:49:43.384 --> 08:49:46.821
MATTER HAS RESURRECTED BASED ON

08:49:46.888 --> 08:49:49.023
THE EXTENSIVE DEBATE THAT WE

08:49:49.090 --> 08:49:53.027
EXPERIENCED LAST SESSION. I

08:49:53.094 --> 08:49:54.329
FIND IT INTERESTING THAT THE

08:49:54.395 --> 08:49:58.967
EXAM ONE OF THE EXTENSIONS. IS

08:49:59.033 --> 08:50:03.571
LIMITED LARGELY TO PRESS AND

08:50:03.638 --> 08:50:06.141
COMMUNICATION OUTLETS THOSE

08:50:06.207 --> 08:50:06.875
THAT HAVE THE POWER TO FORM

08:50:06.941 --> 08:50:08.810
OPINIONS. THOSE THAT HAVE THE

08:50:08.877 --> 08:50:14.149
POWER TO CALL OUT. FOR POLICY

08:50:14.215 --> 08:50:16.284
BUT ACROSS THE BOARD WHETHER IT

08:50:16.351 --> 08:50:19.287
BE CONVENIENCE DRIVERS WHETHER

08:50:19.354 --> 08:50:21.789
IT BEING MUSICIANS WHETHER ME

08:50:21.856 --> 08:50:23.925
HAIR SALON STYLIST SO AND SO

08:50:23.992 --> 08:50:26.027
FORTH THOSE INDIVIDUALS DON'T

08:50:26.094 --> 08:50:28.696
HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE WITH

08:50:28.763 --> 08:50:31.332
PRESTON'S. AND WHILE I'M

08:50:31.399 --> 08:50:32.333
CERTAINLY GOING TO SUPPORT THIS

08:50:32.400 --> 08:50:34.068
BECAUSE IT FRANKLY NEVER SHOULD

08:50:34.135 --> 08:50:36.905
HAVE HAPPENED THIS IS JUST A

08:50:36.971 --> 08:50:40.608
BANDAID. UNDERLYING STRUCTURAL

08:50:40.675 --> 08:50:42.844
DEFICIENCIES THE BABY FIVE.

08:50:42.911 --> 08:50:44.913
ONLY MANIFESTED IN THEIR TRUEST

08:50:44.979 --> 08:50:47.382
FORMS AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE

08:50:47.448 --> 08:50:48.883
NEEDED TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN

08:50:48.950 --> 08:50:51.319
THE WORKFORCE COLEEN HAS TAUGHT

08:50:51.386 --> 08:50:54.622
US. HOW DESPERATE TIMES CAN GET

08:50:54.689 --> 08:50:56.191
ANY HELP AT ALL YOUR MOVIES

08:50:56.257 --> 08:50:59.060
PART TIME- CELL DELINEATING

08:50:59.127 --> 08:51:02.463
SIDE JOBS OR TWO PUTTING FOOD

08:51:02.530 --> 08:51:05.033
ON THE TABLE FOR FAMILIES. SO

08:51:05.099 --> 08:51:05.667
I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO BE

08:51:05.733 --> 08:51:07.602
SUPPORTING THIS BUT WHETHER IT

08:51:07.669 --> 08:51:10.104
IS THAT LAUNDRY LIST THAT WE

08:51:10.171 --> 08:51:12.774
WENT THROUGH LAST CYCLE THE WAR

08:51:12.840 --> 08:51:15.410
MORE DISCREET ISSUES LIKE THIS.

08:51:15.476 --> 08:51:18.413
AP FILE HAS PROVEN. TO BE POOR

08:51:18.479 --> 08:51:20.982
POLICY I THINK THERE IS A

08:51:21.049 --> 08:51:22.584
NUMBER OF WAYS THAT IT COULD BE

08:51:22.650 --> 08:51:25.019
IMPROVED UPON WITHOUT JUMPING

08:51:25.086 --> 08:51:30.024
INTO ART A SWEEPING. SET OF

08:51:30.091 --> 08:51:33.695
CLASSIFICATIONS OF EMPLOYEE OR

08:51:37.165 --> 08:51:40.368
FORMER SO I THINK YOU KNOW

08:51:44.505 --> 08:51:45.440
CHICKENS COMING HOME TO ROOST

08:51:45.506 --> 08:51:47.976
MOMENT. AND I THINK IT'S SAD

08:51:48.042 --> 08:51:49.844
BECAUSE IT'S A TESTAMENT THAT

08:51:49.911 --> 08:51:52.981
WE JUMPED THE GUN LAST CYCLE

08:51:53.047 --> 08:51:58.786
AND WE'RE PAYING THE PRICE NOW.

08:51:58.853 --> 08:51:59.420

PRESIDENT- I RISE RELUCTANTLY

09:06:32.259 --> 09:06:34.595
TO OPPOSE THIS BILL AND THEN

09:06:34.661 --> 09:06:37.297
LET ME TELL YOU WHY. THE ISSUE

09:06:37.364 --> 09:06:39.333
IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT JUST THAT

09:06:39.399 --> 09:06:40.367
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING

09:06:40.434 --> 09:06:42.636
UNITS BUT THE OTHER ISSUE IS

09:06:42.703 --> 09:06:44.104
THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH.

09:06:44.171 --> 09:06:45.739
HOMEOWNERS IN THE STATE OF

09:06:45.806 --> 09:06:47.708
CALIFORNIA AND THE REASON FOR

09:06:47.774 --> 09:06:49.276
THAT IS THE HIGH PRICE OF OUR

09:06:49.343 --> 09:06:51.979
HOUSING. WE HAVE THE LOWEST

09:06:52.045 --> 09:06:54.581
HOME OWNERSHIP. IN THE STATE OF

09:06:54.648 --> 09:06:58.585
CALIFORNIA. THEN WE'VE EVER HAD

09:06:58.652 --> 09:07:00.387
IN OUR HISTORY INCLUDING RIGHT

09:07:00.454 --> 09:07:02.923
B. RIGHT AT THE TIME THAT THE

09:07:02.990 --> 09:07:05.492
GI BILL WAS INSTITUTED. AND

09:07:05.559 --> 09:07:07.895
THAT IS THAT MEANS THAT PEOPLE

09:07:07.961 --> 09:07:09.563
DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

09:07:09.630 --> 09:07:11.899
GET INTO THEIR FIRST HOME. MANY

09:07:11.965 --> 09:07:13.901
OF THE OF THE PEOPLE THAT END

09:07:13.967 --> 09:07:16.503
UP LIVING IN HOAS MOVING TO A

09:07:16.570 --> 09:07:17.704
CHOICE BECAUSE THERE ARE FOUR

09:07:17.771 --> 09:07:20.908
DOUBLE. AND THEY'RE USUALLY IN

09:07:20.974 --> 09:07:22.976
SMALLER LOT SIZES WHICH MEANS

09:07:23.043 --> 09:07:23.810
THAT THEY'RE MUCH MORE

09:07:23.877 --> 09:07:26.113
AFFORDABLE END TO END AND PART

09:07:26.180 --> 09:07:26.780
OF THE REASON THEY'RE

09:07:26.847 --> 09:07:28.415
ATTRACTIVE IS THAT THEY'RE ALL

09:07:28.482 --> 09:07:31.218
OWNED. BY PEOPLE WHO WHO BUY

09:07:31.285 --> 09:07:33.287
INTO THE INTO THE PROJECTS AND

09:07:33.353 --> 09:07:35.255
WHO LIVE THERE AND ARE NOT

09:07:35.322 --> 09:07:38.058
RENTING AND SO TO OVER RULE OR

09:07:38.125 --> 09:07:40.460
OVER RIDE THE H. AWAY RULES

09:07:40.527 --> 09:07:43.497
THAT SAY. THOU SHALT NOT RENT

09:07:43.564 --> 09:07:46.033
OUT YOUR UNIT MEANS THAT WE ARE

09:07:46.099 --> 09:07:47.367
MAKING THE DECISION HERE AT THE

09:07:47.434 --> 09:07:50.370
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO OVERRULE

09:07:50.437 --> 09:07:52.339
LOCAL LOCAL DECISIONS THAT WERE

09:07:52.406 --> 09:07:54.241
MADE ABOUTWHO WHO COULD

09:07:54.308 --> 09:07:55.809
ACTUALLY LIVE IN IN THESE IN

09:07:55.876 --> 09:07:57.411
THESE PROJECTS AND WHEN THESE

09:07:57.477 --> 09:07:59.413
UNITS SELF. PAY USUALLY G VERY

09:07:59.479 --> 09:08:02.049
QUICKLY BECAUSE THEY'RE ONE OF

09:08:02.115 --> 09:08:03.383
THE AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT ARE

09:08:03.450 --> 09:08:05.919
STILL LEFT ON THE MARKET SO I'M

WAS- IT WAS A GOOD INTENTION

09:08:12.259 --> 09:08:13.760
BUT I THINK THE INADVERTENT

09:08:13.827 --> 09:08:15.095
IMPACT IS GOING TO BE THAT

09:08:15.162 --> 09:08:17.164
WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING. AWAY

09:08:17.231 --> 09:08:19.333
THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO NOT HAVE

09:08:19.399 --> 09:08:20.267
RENTAL UNITS IN IN THEIR

09:08:20.334 --> 09:08:22.903
PROJECTS AND- AND THAT STARTS

09:08:22.970 --> 09:08:25.172
TO DEGRADE THE UNITS AND- THAT

09:08:25.239 --> 09:08:26.273
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT TO SEE

09:08:26.340 --> 09:08:27.374
WE WANT TO SEE MORE HOME

IS SAYING WE ABSOLUTELY WANT

09:08:44.458 --> 09:08:45.425
INCREASE HOMEOWNERSHIP IF

09:08:45.492 --> 09:08:46.994
PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE THE- CAPITAL

DON'T ALLOW FOR THAT THIS

09:08:51.498 --> 09:08:52.833

09:15:42.409 --> 09:15:43.443
LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLEX IN

09:15:43.510 --> 09:15:45.912

IT IS YOUR QUESTION THE OLD

09:15:58.858 --> 09:16:00.627
PRESIDIO AREA THAT WAS

DEVELOPED IN THE POINT LOMA

09:16:02.495 --> 09:16:03.496
AREA ADJACENT TO WHAT WE'RE

09:16:03.563 --> 09:16:05.298

09:16:15.141 --> 09:16:17.444
AM THE- I'M GOING TO SUPPORT

09:16:17.510 --> 09:16:19.879
THIS FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS

09:16:19.946 --> 09:16:21.281
ONE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

09:16:21.347 --> 09:16:22.849
THE STADIUM CONNIE. IN THE

09:16:22.916 --> 09:16:24.150

STREAMLINING EFFORTS- OR FOUGHT

09:16:57.083 --> 09:16:59.419

09:19:42.348 --> 09:19:44.918
ISSUES. THE SIMPLE PROCESS IS

09:19:44.984 --> 09:19:47.453
DESIGNED SO THAT WE WILL. BE

09:19:47.520 --> 09:19:49.756
CLEAR AND PROTECTOR OF ALL THE

09:19:49.822 --> 09:19:51.291
COMMUNITIES AROUND WHICH THESE

09:19:51.357 --> 09:19:53.092
DEVELOPMENTS ARE GOING ON

09:19:53.159 --> 09:19:55.094
BECAUSE- THE DEVELOPERS WHO

09:19:55.161 --> 09:19:56.696
WANT TO BUILD GENERALLY

09:19:56.763 --> 09:19:59.699
SPEAKING. ARE MORE FOCUSED ON

09:19:59.766 --> 09:20:01.501
THEIR FINANCIAL GAIN. THE

09:20:01.567 --> 09:20:03.670
SIMPLE PROCESS REQUIRES THEM TO

09:20:03.736 --> 09:20:05.271
CONSIDER THE COMMUNITY THE

09:20:05.338 --> 09:20:07.173
ENVIRONMENT AND THE QUALITY OF

09:20:07.240 --> 09:20:08.408
LIFE ISSUES WHICH ARE WHAT

09:20:08.474 --> 09:20:09.842
MAKES CALIFORNIA IS SUCH A

09:20:09.909 --> 09:20:13.680
GREAT PLACE TO BE. THIS MEASURE

09:20:13.746 --> 09:20:16.749
DOES HAVE A- AN EXPEDITED

09:20:16.816 --> 09:20:18.117
JUDICIAL REVIEW PROCESS

09:20:18.184 --> 09:20:19.485
SOMETHING WHICH I GENERALLY

09:20:19.552 --> 09:20:22.789
OPPOSE. BUT IN THIS CASE THE

09:20:22.855 --> 09:20:24.958
STANDARDS THAT ARE. BEING

09:20:25.024 --> 09:20:26.859
REQUIRED HERE ARE OF THE

09:20:26.926 --> 09:20:30.797
HIGHEST LEVELS. AND IT IS MY

09:20:30.863 --> 09:20:31.297
HOPE THAT GOING FORWARD

09:20:31.364 --> 09:20:32.498
PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING

09:20:32.565 --> 09:20:35.234
DEVELOPED WILL IN FACT BE MADE

09:20:35.301 --> 09:20:37.337
OF THE HIGHEST LEVEL. AND THAT

09:20:37.403 --> 09:20:38.538
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS WE

09:20:38.604 --> 09:20:40.940
CAN DO TO EXPEDITE THE SEQUEL

09:20:41.007 --> 09:20:43.042
PROCESS WITHOUT UNDERMINING IT

09:20:43.109 --> 09:20:44.310
AND MANY OF THEM ARE BILLS THAT

09:20:44.377 --> 09:20:46.512
I'VE TRIED TO BRING FORWARD AND

09:20:46.579 --> 09:20:47.480
I HOPE IN THE FUTURE. OTHERS

09:20:47.547 --> 09:20:50.249
WILL. FOLLOW THAT EFFORT TO

09:20:50.316 --> 09:20:52.685
STREAMLINE IT BUT NOT A RADIC

09:20:52.752 --> 09:20:54.887
HATED AND UNFORTUNATELY THOSE

09:20:54.954 --> 09:20:56.689
WHO ARE- BUILDERS AND

09:20:56.756 --> 09:20:58.191
DEVELOPERS WOULD RATHER SEE IT

09:20:58.257 --> 09:21:00.593
GO AWAY FREQUENTLY SUPER BY THE

09:21:00.660 --> 09:21:02.729
WAY IS USED BY COMPETITORS IT

09:21:02.795 --> 09:21:04.297
ISN'T USED BY COMMUNITIES IT'S

09:21:04.364 --> 09:21:07.333
USED BY BUSINESSES. TO TRY TO.

09:21:07.400 --> 09:21:09.869
CREATE OBSTACLES FOR THEIR-

09:21:09.936 --> 09:21:11.704
OPPONENTS AND FOR THEIR

09:21:11.771 --> 09:21:14.841
COMPETITION SO- I WANT TO THANK

09:21:14.907 --> 09:21:17.877
THE ASSEMBLY THE MAN GLORIA FOR

09:21:17.944 --> 09:21:20.246
THIS BILL BECAUSE HE REALLY HAS

09:21:20.313 --> 09:21:22.949
INSISTED UPON A VERY HIGH BAR.

09:21:23.016 --> 09:21:24.617
THERE IS A REVIEW BUT I WILL

09:21:24.684 --> 09:21:26.886
ALSO CAUTIONED THAT THIS IS NOT

09:21:26.953 --> 09:21:28.755
ANYTHING THAT IS MANDATE THE

09:21:28.821 --> 09:21:30.923
MANDATORY THE COURTS. WILL DO

09:21:30.990 --> 09:21:33.393
THEIR BEST TO TRY TO MEET THAT

09:21:33.459 --> 09:21:34.093
TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAY

09:21:34.160 --> 09:21:37.964
ROOM A REVIEW. REQUIREMENT BUT

09:21:38.031 --> 09:21:38.531
THERE ARE. FRANKLY WHEN YOU

09:21:38.598 --> 09:21:40.500
TALKTO MANY OF THE- JUDGES ARE

09:21:40.566 --> 09:21:42.068
EXPERT IN THE FIELD THEY TELL

09:21:42.135 --> 09:21:43.669
YOU THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY

09:21:43.736 --> 09:21:45.738
IMPOSSIBLE TO DO IT WITHIN TWO

09:21:45.805 --> 09:21:47.040
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS AND

09:21:47.106 --> 09:21:50.376
THAT'S BECAUSE- BOTH SIDES.

09:21:50.443 --> 09:21:52.545
NEED THAT ADDITIONAL TIME BUT

09:21:52.612 --> 09:21:54.480
AGAIN LET'S BE CLEAR ON WHAT

09:21:54.547 --> 09:21:56.282
SHE IS INNOCENT I THINK THAT'S

09:21:56.349 --> 09:21:58.084
THE POINT HERE THIS IS A GOOD

09:21:58.151 --> 09:22:01.621
BILL- AGAIN- THERE'S NOTHING

09:22:01.687 --> 09:22:02.822
PERFECT IN THE WORLD IN WHICH

09:22:02.889 --> 09:22:04.557
WE LIVE- BUT THIS IS REALLY

09:22:04.624 --> 09:22:06.325
SOMETHING THAT DOES TRY TO

09:22:06.392 --> 09:22:07.226
MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST OF

09:22:07.293 --> 09:22:10.363
STANDARDS- AND HOPEFULLY WILL.

09:22:10.430 --> 09:22:12.565
BE PART OF WHAT LEADS THE WAY

09:22:12.632 --> 09:22:15.535

09:22:21.774 --> 09:22:22.675
ADDITIONAL BUILDING THAT WE

09:22:22.742 --> 09:22:25.311
NEED HERE IN THE STATE WITH

09:22:50.570 --> 09:22:52.004
SURE THAT WE HAVE THE C. FOR

STRINGENT IN CALIFORNIA I DO-

DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE IN

09:22:58.411 --> 09:23:00.346
SANTA BARBARA THAT SEQUEL IS-

09:23:00.413 --> 09:23:01.681
SOMETHING THAT IS FABULOUS FOR

THIS STATE IT'S ACTUALLY NOT-

09:23:04.884 --> 09:23:06.519

FOR SEQUEL- WHEN IT SUITS SAID

09:23:08.788 --> 09:23:11.090
THE MAJORITY PARTY. AND WHEN

ISSUE WITH THE UNITED STATES

09:23:37.116 --> 09:23:39.051
BEING APPROVED BUT NORMAL

09:23:39.118 --> 09:23:40.920
PROCESSES WOULD TAKE YEARS TO

09:23:40.987 --> 09:23:42.488
GET THROUGH- EVEN THOUGH THEY
