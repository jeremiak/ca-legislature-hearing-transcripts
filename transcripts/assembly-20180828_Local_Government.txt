ABOUT WELL IN SOME PARTS OF OUR STATE THERE ARE AFFORDABLE IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN DELAYED OR STOPPED. WHERE PROJECTS ARE REQUIRED TO GET A LETTER OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM AN INDIVIDUAL CITY COUNCIL MEMBER IN WHOSE DISTRICT A PROJECT MAY BE LOCATED? AS A CONDITION FOR RECEIVING FUNDING WITHOUT THIS LETTER A PROJECT CAN NOT GET INTO A PIPELINE FOR FUNDING. AND MANY OF THESE PROJECTS ALSO RECEIVE STATE FUNDING AND SO AS A RESULT OF THIS CURRENT POLICY PROJECTS ARE BEING HALTED OR STALLED SINCE. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET THE SIGN OFF OF A SINGLE LOCAL ELECTED THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THE USE OF AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT LETTER AS A THRESHOLD CONDITION. LOCAL OFFICIALS WILL STILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INFLUENCE PROJECTS TO THE PLANNING PROCESS BUT THEY WILL NOT HAVE A POCKET VETO. AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY WITNESS. GOOD MORNING ON LAWLER WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- THESE LIVING AUDIT REQUIREMENTS CREATE AN ARBITRARY BARRIER TO PROJECTS BEFORE AN APPLICATION FOR THE PROJECT HAS EVEN BEEN FILED -- THIS BILL WOULD PUT A STOP TO THAT PRACTICE ANALOG QUICKLY NEEDED SUPPORT OF HOUSING PROJECTS TO MOVE FORWARD -- AND WITHOUT WILL SPREE SPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEASURES OUT. SIX ZERO A NEXT WILL HELP ITEM NUMBER -- TWO SENATOR JACKSON SP FOUR SIXTY FIVE WELCOME SENATOR. GOOD MORNING HOME TEASE ME MATT MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. YOU KNOW AS WE ARE LOOKING AND SO MANY OF US AND I KNOW THE CHAIR OF PARTICULARLY -- AT THE IMPACTS OF THE WILDFIRES THAT WE'RE HAVING -- IN CALIFORNIA AND HAD LAST YEAR. OF WHICH COST LIVES AND DESTROYED THOUSANDS OF HOMES. A ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS WHAT CAN AND MUST WE DO TO TRY -- TO EITHER PREVENT OR MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF THESE FIRES GOING FORWARD WE TALK ABOUT -- ALL SORTS OF NEW FOREST MANAGEMENT ISSUES WE TALK ABOUT ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE. ONE OF THE THINGS THOUGH THAT WE HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO HARDEN NOT JUST THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE UTILITY COMPANIES. BUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR OWN HOMES. BECAUSE THAT BECOMES AT MANY POINTS THE KEY SIR THE FULCRUM FOR THESE FIRES. AND SO THIS IS A BILL F. I. S. BEFORE SIXTY FIVE THAT WHILE FIRE SAFETY FINANCE ACT. WHICH AUTHORIZES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO EXPAND THEIR PROPERTY ASSESSED CLEAN ENERGY OR PACE PROGRAMS. TO ALLOW PROPERTY OWNERS TO FINANCE THE INSTALLATION AWHILE FIRE SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS FOR THEIR HOMES AND BUSINESSES WHAT WE MIGHT CALL HARDENING. OUR HOMES -- AND I'D FIRST LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE THIS -- THIS BILL IS RELATIVELY NEW I WAS LOOKING FOR A WAY WHAT CAN WE DO TO TO HELP PEOPLE A GET RID OF SHAKE ROOFS OR DOUBLE PANE THEIR WINDOWS OR CHEST BASIC THINGS. THAT WILL HELP REDUCE OF THESE FIRES ARE HOPEFULLY HELP PRODUCE THESE FIRES FROM DESTROYING HOMES I WAS USING THIS MORNING I THINK ON NPR THE NUMBER OF HOMES A PERCENTAGE OF HOMES. THAT HAVE BEEN REBUILT. US SINCE THESE FIRES IS TO AND PART OF THE REASON A OF COURSE IS LACK OF INSURANCE ARE UNDER INSURANCE THE EXTENT OF THESE FIRES. BUT PART OF IT IS FOR THOSE WHOSE HOMES ARE STILL REMAINING. WE NEED TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE MAKE ADJUSTMENTS OUGHT TO THE STRUCTURES TO HELP PREVENT THOSE STRUCTURES BEING DESTROYED GOING FORWARD SO I WANT TO THANK -- THE COMMITTEE FREE FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE AND I THINK THE MOST RECENT SET OF AMENDMENTS -- ARE KEY CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS AND ENSURE THAT WAS STRIKING THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND USING PACE AS A TOOL TO HARDEN OUR EXISTING HOMES. AGAINST THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE THIS BILL THEY DON'T LIKE PACE. THIS BILL ISN'T ABOUT WITH YOU LIKE PACE OR DON'T LIKE PACE THIS IS A BILL THAT SAYS WALL PACES STILL THERE AND I KNOW THE CHURN PARTICULARS BEEN WORKING TO MAKE REFORMS. BUT WHILE THAT MONEY IS THERE LET'S ADD A A CRITERIA THAT ALLOWS FOR PACE FUNDS TO BE USED FOR HARDENING OF HOMES. I EXISTING HOMES NOT NEW HOMES THAT WE HAVE TO REBUILD THIS IS A PREVENTIVE ACT AND JOB -- I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR IT'S ASSISTANCE WITH THAT'S NOT I DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD ALL THESE WILDFIRES AND THOUSANDS OF HOMES HAVE BEEN LOST. BUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT -- WE NEED TO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THIS ASPECT OF THE DISCUSSION AS WELL AS HARDENING THE GRADE IN THESE OTHER THINGS SO. IT TURNS OUT THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL INC A MAINTAINED TO LIST OF UPGRADES THAT HOMEOWNERS AND HIGH FIRE HAZARD AREAS SHOULD UNDERTAKE TO MAKE THEIR HOMES MORE RESILIENT TO WILDFIRES. INCLUDING AS I MENTIONED GETTING RID OF WHO WOULD -- OR ROUTE A SHINGLE ROOFS AND WOOD SIGHTINGS. BUT OF COURSE THE COST OF THESE CAN BE. QUITE PROHIBITIVE I KNOW WHEN WE REPLACED OUR SHINGLED ROOF IT WAS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS UP BUT IT'S NECESSARY YOUR INVESTMENT HOLE FOR MANY PEOPLE YOUR HOME IS YOUR PRIMARY INVESTMENT. AND BECAUSE OF A THE YEAH INCIDENTS OF FIRES AND THEIR IMPACTS OF THIS IS THE KIND OF THING WE NEED TO BE FOCUSING OUR ATTENTION ON ITS HOMEOWNERS WE ARE EMPOWERED THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO. AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM SO I WOULD LIKE TO ALLOW HOMEOWNERS AND BUSINESSES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROGRAM. A TO FINANCE SOME OF THESE ARE HOME HARDENING UPGRADES RIGHT NOW PAYS CAN ONLY BE USED FOR ENERGY AND WATER EFFICIENCY PROJECTS AND SEISMIC UPGRADES AND I WILL TELL YOU THOSE ARE ALL IMPORTANT NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. BUT AS WE LOOK AT THE DEVASTATION OF THE SHOULD BE ADDING THIS KIND OF CRITERIA -- TO THIS OPPORTUNITY TO GET SOME PAYS FOR ANYTHING AND SO. WITH THAT I KNOW AS I MENTIONED THAT THE CHAIR IS WORKING ON REFORMING PACE I HAVE NO. QUARREL WITH THAT I THINK THAT THAT WORK IS IMPORTANT AND I KNOW HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF LOTS OF DISCUSSION. BUT AGAIN WALL PACE IS THERE LET'S ADD THIS VERY IMPORTANT CRITERIA TO HELP EMPOWER PEOPLE TO TECH THEIR HOMES ARE IN THESE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES SO. SPECIFICALLY THIS MEASURE INCORPORATES ITS OWN CONSUMER PROTECTIONS BY AMONG OTHER THINGS ENSURING REGULATORY OVERSIGHT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. REQUIRING PATIENT MINISTRY TO REACH TO REPORT ON WILDLIFE SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE FINANCED UNDER THE BILL. LIMIT FIRE HARDENING THROUGH PACE TO PROPERTIES THAT ARE LOCATED IN VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY SONGS TARGETING THIS FUNDING FOR THAT WHERE IT'S GOING TO DO THE BEST. A BEST AND AND HIGHEST USE LIMITING THE TYPES OF PROJECTS ELIGIBLE FOR PACE. TO THOSE IDENTIFIED ALREADY IDENTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION. AND PLACING A TEN YEAR SUNSET. ON THIS ASPECT OF PACE SO THAT OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS OF OUR FUTURE LEGISLATURE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW HOW WELL FIRE HARDENING OF THE OF THE SPACE PROGRAM HAS FUNCTION WITHOUT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESS SUPPORT CERTAINLY PAUL MAY SO THAT IT FOREST TRUST ALSO VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF I YOU PREFER THE SENATOR BRING THIS FORWARD AND HE DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF LAYING OUT MUCH THE CONTACTS. WE CAN DO. ALL OF THE DIFFERENT OP FUELS MANAGEMENT AND OTHER INCENTIVES FOR THE WOOD PRODUCTSINDUSTRY IN THESE VARIOUS BILLS ARE MOVING FORWARD THIS YEAR AND WE SHOULD BE DOING ALL THOSE THINGS. BUT WHEN THE HOMES THEMSELVES ARE THE FUEL. WE WILL NEVER SOLVE THE PROBLEM. AND WHILE WE HAVE GOOD BUILDING STANDARDS NOW. WE ALSO HAVE MORE THAN A MILLION HOMES OUT IN THESE HIGH RISK AREAS THAT WERE BUILT BEFORE THESE MODERN BUILDING STANDARDS I MEAN. THE CHAIR HAS MANY OF THESE AND HER HALL EARNED HER DISTRICT YOU DID HAVE. WELL THERE STILL ARE SOME AND THE NUGGETS ARE LOOKING AROUND LAKE COUNTY AND THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NEVER GOING TO HAVE. TEN FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GO OUT AND FIX THEIR HIGH RISK OF FACTORS ON THEIR HOMES UNLESS WE MAKE SOME SORT OF FINANCING AVAILABLE. OFTEN WILL BRING A MULTIPLE BENEFITS TO BUILD UP GREATER ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF THE ROOF WITH THE FOR THE SAME TIME BUT WE NEED TO BRING THESE TOOLS FORWARD BECAUSE WE'LL NEVER WE'LL NEVER SOLVE OUR HOME LOSS PROBLEM WITHOUT MAKING THE HOMES MORE DEFENSIBLE. WE INCURRED YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN A SUPPORT MADAM CHAIR OF MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE CHRISTY ABOUT MOMMY HALF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS WERE PLEASED TO BE IN SUPPORT THIS MEASURE I WOULD JUST SAY IT IS A COMPLEX PROBLEM. THIS IS ONE PART IN OUR COMMUNITIES ZONES ARE UNDER THREAT. AND MAYBE IMPROVEMENTS WOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE FOR NOT ALSO MANAGING OUR FORESTS OF BECAUSE THESE FIRES ARE BURNING AT THE INTENSITIES WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE SO WE'RE VERY PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. I KNOW THIS COMMITTEE HAS GRAPPLED WITH WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THESE HOMES IN THESE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACES -- AND THIS IS ONE IMPORTANT STEP ONE OF MANY THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS LUCAS FOR EXAMPLE HAVE THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AMBER PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE BILL BUT ALSO BECAUSE A LOT OF THE CAL THE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES THAT ARRIVED TO STAY OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS THE SEEMS LIKE A NATURAL EXPANSION OF THE PACER FINANCING PROGRAM THINK VERY. MUCH THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING I'M CATHERINE GARCIA ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHRIS ROGERS WITH MY GREEN ENERGY FUND RIGHT HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT I AS WAS MENTIONED THE WILD AN URBAN INTERFACE PLAN CALLS FOR SPECIALIZED VENTS AND WINDOWS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MARK LET YOU KNOW BEHALF OVER NEW FINANCIAL ALSO IN SUPPORT APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BRING THESE FORWARD AND THE RECOGNITION THAT PACE IS ABOUT OVER FINANCING PRODUCT. FOR MANY HOMEOWNERS WHO NEED TO DO THESE TYPE OF IMPROVEMENTS AS FOR LIVE OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS LEXI HOWARD ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ESCROW ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION. FIRST I'D LIKE TO OFFER MY THANKS TO THE SENATOR FOR HER WORK ON THIS INTO YOU CHAIR FOR YOUR WORK ON PACE -- WE DON'T DISLIKE PACE WE RECOGNIZE IT SERVES CONSUMERS WELL WHEN IT'S DONE RESPONSIBLY. BUT THERE ARE PLACES THAT WE HAVE SEEN OUR ESCROW PEOPLE WHEN THEY HAVE BUYERS AND SELLERS IN THEIR OFFICES SURPRISED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY THEIR PACE. ASSESSMENT IN FULL IN ORDER TO COMPLETE A TRANSACTION WE HAVE LENDERS WHO CANNOT RECOVER. WHEN THERE IS A PACE LOAN PLACED ON THERE ON A PROPERTY AFTER THEY HAVE ORIGINATED THE LOAN THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE CONSIDER THEN THE UNDERWRITING? AT HOUSE FIRST LIEN PRIORITY AND THE CAPE FOR FUND THAT IS THE PACE LOSS RESERVE FUND IS NOT AVAILABLE BEFORE SECOND MORTGAGES ONLY FOR FIRST. SO WE ARE. RESPECTFUL IN OUR OPPOSITION MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE IN FIRE AFFECTED AREAS AND WE UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF PACE WE DO NO TO THAT PACE AS AN ENERGY EFFICIENT A IMPROVEMENT DOES INCLUDE UNDER PRESENT STATUTE THE ABILITY TO REPLACE ROOFS AND WINDOWS AMONG OTHER THINGS WE ARE CONCERNED WHEN WE EXPAND THAT TO THINGS LIKE. ROADS AND ACCESS AND FENCES AND OTHER THINGS PARTICULARLY IN THE REALM OF INSURANCE THERE IS AN OPEN QUESTION RIGHT NOW ABOUT HOUSES THAT HAVE BURNED THAT HAD PIECE ASSESSMENTS. AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE VALUE OF THOSE ASSESSMENTS THOSE BORROWERS STILL HAVE THOSE TAX COLLECTIONS ON THE TAX ROLLS. AND COME. APRIL TENTH AND DECEMBER FOR BE PAYING TAXES ON THOSE AND THEIR TAXES INCREASED MARKEDLY WE DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WILL BE DEALT WITH BETWEEN THE PACE PROVIDERS. AND THE HOMEOWNERS SO RESPECTFULLY WE ARE IN FAVOR OF PACE WHEN DONE RESPONSIBLY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IT BEING EXPANDED AT A TIME WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH THAT IS DYNAMIC. AND THANK YOU VERY BUT I'M WITH US [inaudible] NOT. ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MY NAME IS ANNA BUT I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS -- I'D LIKE TO START BY BEING CLEAR THE REALTORS SUPPORT RESPONSIBLE PACE FUNDING. AS WELL AS THE EFFORT BY SENATOR JACKSON TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX THE POTENTIAL USE THE PACE PROGRAM AS A WAY. FOR HOMEOWNERS TO FINANCE THIS HOME HARDENING -- WHICH CAN AID -- IN MAKING AYE CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING STOCK MORSE SAFE AND MORE RESILIENT AGAINST -- THESE TERRIBLE WILDFIRES THAT ARE -- STATESMAN FACING -- HOWEVER ALONG WITH CONSUMER GROUPS THE REALTORS IN THE BANKING AND THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY HAVE WORKED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS TO COME UP WITH A SET OF REFORMS ONE OF THEM IS YOUR BELT -- THAT ADDRESS SOME OF THESE -- ALLEGATIONS OF CONSUMERSEEN IN THE INDUSTRY -- WHILE STILL MAINTAINING THE HEALTH OF THIS INDUSTRY BECAUSE WE DO SEE IT AS A VALUABLE PRODUCTS -- THE LEGISLATURE IS STILL CONSIDERING TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION AS I MENTIONED ONE OF THOSE IS YOURS -- ALSO THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT WILL BEGIN ITS RULE MAKING PROCESS THIS NEXT YEAR TO REGULATE THIS PREVIOUSLY UNREGULATED INDUSTRY. AND GIVEN THAT THIS IS AN INDUSTRY INFLUX WHICH HOW SPACE SCRUTINY IN THE PAST WE ARE HYDE PARK DO WE ARE JUST HARD PRESSED TO SEE HOW NOW. IN THE LAST FEW DAYS OF THIS SESSION IS A GOOD TIME TEXT IT EXPAND THIS PROGRAM AND WE HAVE TO ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THIS OPPOSITION MADAM CHAIR VERY BRIEFLY PAUL YODER AND PINCH HITTING FOR KAREN LANE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY TREASURES AND TAX COLLECTORS BUT THERE'S A LITTLE IRONY. IN THIS BILL AND I WANT TO GIVE THE MEMBERS -- JUST EVERYBODY A PROTEST. IF YOU GET. YOU YOU FINANCE SOMETHING THROUGH PACE ESPECIALLY SOMETHING FOR A FIRE HARDING PURPOSE MAKE SURE YOU ASK YOUR INSURER. TO COVER IT BECAUSE THEY WON'T ON THE NATURAL IT'S NOT LIKE PM I IT'S NOT AND IRONICALLY IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE STATE. PEOPLE HAVE HAD THEIR HOUSES BURNED DOWN. WITH PEACEFUL MEANS ON THEIR HOUSE. THAT THEY STILL HAD TO PAY OFF AND I AM I THINK A LOT OF THE MEMBERS ARE AWARE OF THAT BUT I JUST WE FEEL LIKE WE CANNOT EMPHASIZE IT TO YOU ALL. ENOUGH THANK YOU I BELIEVE WE GOT THAT IN THEMSELVES. THAT'S CORRECT IT'S A PART OF THE AMENDMENTS FROM YESTERDAY THANK YOU FOR THAT POINTING THAT OUT GET RIGHT. I ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION MINIATURE CREEK PAGE OF THE CALIFORNIA LAND TITLE SITUATION. FOR MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE MENTIONED EARLIER CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS THE PACE IS BOOMING AND WE'VE SEEN A TENDENCY OF CONSUMERS TO BE CONFUSE AND ASK ROSE. TO HAVING TO PAY OFF OF THEIR REFINANCING I MEAN THE BILL UNABLE TO REFINANCE HAVING TO PAY OFF THE LOAN BEFORE THEY CAN SELL THEIR THEIR HOUSE AND THEN OFFICE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE BEING S. RECENTLY CAME THROUGH RECESSION WERE THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO VOTE MORE IN. THEIR HOMES AND THEY WERE WORTH AND I'M CONCERNED THAT AS A DOWNTURN THE MARKET OF AS THE GOVERNOR HAS WARNED US ALL ABOUT IN HIS BUDGETING. THAT WILL HAPPEN AND HOPEFULLY -- WORSE WERE SOMEWHAT CONCERNED ABOUT PEOPLE BEING OVER EXTENDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. OKAY -- IS THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. YES UP ASSEMBLY MEMBER COMING ERA. SO I I'M I'M NOT SURE I HAVE A QUESTION AS MUCH AS A COMMENT TONIGHT I AM [inaudible] HAD A BASED ON THAT. DIED SOMEWHERE LAST YEAR. NOT SURE WHERE BUT BUT I WAS IT THAT I WAS -- SPONSORED BY IS THE AT TAX COLLECTORS AND THE ASSESSORS AND THE INFORMATION THAT THEY HAVE I'D QUITE FRANKLY IS THAT -- THE PREDATORY LENDING HAD LED -- TO SITUATIONS WHERE IN MANY COUNTIES -- THE THE POSSIBILITY THAT PEOPLE WERE GOING TO LOSE THEIR HOUSE BECAUSE PASTE LOANS BECAUSE I COULDN'T AFFORD THAT THE LOAN ON THE HOUSE AS WELL AS THE PACE ON WAS WAS VERY REAL AND AND WAYS. IT IT IT FITS THE TSUNAMI -- THAT ARTICLE -- THAT. THAT IT IT HAD THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE A BUNCH OF LOW INCOME MODERATE INCOME PEOPLE. LOSING THEIR HOMES BECAUSE THEY JUST WITH PREDATORY LENDING AND THEY JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT -- THE MECHANISM OF OF IT AT THE PACE SLOW MOVING INTO THE FIRST ITEM FIRST POSITION. AND AND AND PEOPLE WILL SAY WELL NO IT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT HAPPEN AND I'VE TALKED TO THE PEACE PROVIDERS HOWEVER THE WAY THAT THE TAX COLLECTORS DO THEIR ASSESSMENTS -- THEY GOTTA WAIT FIVE YEARS AND SO IT'S A PROCESS WHERE -- THE THE THE DELINQUENCIES MOUNT THEY BECOME INSURMOUNTABLE AND AND THEY HAVE TO WAIT FIVE YEARS BEFORE THEY CAN START TAKING OVER THE HOUSE THE HOME SO. THERE MAY NOT BE ANY RIGHT NOW BUT GET BUT IT'S COMING AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT -- I AM VERY I'M VERY COGNIZANT OF THE NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE AN ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GET IN AND MAKE THAT THE CHANGES THAT. THEY THEY CAN ABOUT I'M REALLY CONCERNED THAT -- THAT IN MANY MANY INSTANCES -- PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DUPED INTO -- DOING THIS CHANGES SO I'M NOT I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY -- I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT -- DYING THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE BUT YOU KNOW I JUST DON'T SEE IT BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT I FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH IT ON THE FLOOR IN A MAYBE I CAN TALK. TO MADAM CHAIR AND SEE WHAT HER BELT. YOU KNOW HOW IT IT STARTS TO ON SET UP SOME OF THE THE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE LENDERS AND AND A RECOGNITION THAT AT SOME POINT SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE DETERMINING WHAT'S THE INCOME. IT OF THIS HOUSEHOLD AND WHAT IS THEIR ABILITY TO PAY FOR ADDITIONAL WORK ON ON THEIR HOME AND WHAT KIND OF ADVICE MINTZ DO THEY NEED TO RECEIVE SO -- I I'M I'M VERY COGNIZANT REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE OPPOSITION SOME SHOWING UP BECAUSE IT SOME OF THE SAME BUT FRANKLY I HAVE A STAFF FOR COMPLETION OF NO -- BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT ON GIVING HAVING MORE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX IS IMPORTANT BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER WE'RE DOING IN TERMS OF THE PACE GOING FORWARD. THAT WE'RE PROTECTING CONSUMERS IN IT AND IF I MAY I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU AND I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CHAIR ON THIS SO THAT'S WHY I A DECIDED THAT EXPANDING PAYS TO ALLOW FOR FINANCING OF HOME HARDENING PROJECT. SHOULD ONLY BE ALLOWED. A IF WE ALSO REQUIRE ROBUST UNDERWRITING. A WHICH IS WHY I'VE MADE THE BILL CONTINGENT UPON THE PROVISIONS OF YOUR CHAIRS AB. TWENTY SIXTY THREE ARM. THIS IS WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO COMPOUND THE FELONY AS THEY SAY SO THIS BILL IS CONTINGENT ONLY UPON CLEANING UP THIS PROCESS THROUGH THE PACE OF REFORM BILL THAT THE CHAIR HAS INTRODUCED. AND ALSO IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THERE WAS A BILL LAST YEAR THAT STARTED THIS MOVEMENT TOWARDS CORRECTING THE PROBLEM AND AGAIN -- I DON'T I DON'T WANT TO SEE THIS PROGRAM UNLESS WE HAVE THESE ADDITIONAL A PROTECTIONS WHICH IS WHY THE THE BILL IS CONTINGENT UPON THESE PROTECTIONS RATING IN PLACE I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE SESSIONS STARTING FROM BOTH SIDES HERE SOON SO I WON'T TAKE A LOT OF TIME OUTSIDE OF THE FACT. THANK YOU FOR THE BILL -- FOR THE CONCERNS FOR FIRE AND THE HARDENING. I CONCUR AND SHARE MUCH OF THE SENTIMENT WITH MY COLLEAGUE AND WILL SUPPORTING GETTING OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE BUT AGAIN SHARING THE CONCERNS. WE'LL REEVALUATE WHEN IT GETS A FOUR BUT THANK YOU FOR BRING IT FORWARD THERE'S A LOT OF WORK STILL THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION. ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION ABOUT IT CONSUMER PROTECTION IS SORT OF A PASSION OF MINE ARE AYE THE APPRECIATE THOSE CONCERNS AND CERTAINLY -- INVITE THE CHARITY POINT -- WELCOME HER A ASSURING YOU THAT THIS THIS BILL. DOESN'T MOVE UNLESS WEEKS SHE THOSE REFORMS THAT ARE BASED UPON THE CHAIRS BILL. THANK YOU ANY ANY OTHER COMMENTS --% BEFORE YOU CLOSE ALL JUST SAY A FEW THINGS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND YOU KNOW I WAS VERY APPREHENSIVE INITIALLY BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED TO KEEP FOCUSED ON THE BOTTOM MIGHT. BUT MY PIC PACE BILL -- AND I THINK IT'S THE AS TIME WENT ON I GAVE US MORE FUN I THOUGHT. THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO PUT THIS THROUGH -- HARDENING IS A HARDING'S A REALLY IMPORTANT THING THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE -- NICE TO SUPPORT THE WHOLE IDEA BUT BECAUSE OF THE ONGOING CONVERSATION THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED FOR THE LASTYEAR TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS MEANINGFUL STATEWIDE OVERSIGHT OF THE PACE PROGRAM -- AS YOU KNOW I HAVE MY OWN LEGISLATION ON PACE WHICH MAY MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE SIGNED ON AS CO AUTHORS. MY BILL MAKE CERTAIN THAT IT HOMEOWNERS ABILITY TO PAY FOR HOME OFFICIALS HE PROJECTS. FULLY VERIFIED BEFORE I WANNA SAY BEFORE THEY SIGN THE ASSESSMENT OR HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACT. AND BEFORE WORK ON THE IMPROVEMENT ACTUALLY BEGINS AND SO I APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT YOU SPENT ON THIS -- A SENATOR -- I THINK THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO HELP OUT IS A HOMEOWNERS AS WELL -- LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE I SO I WANT TO JUST PUT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED AND PUT IT INTO THIS BILL. A TEN YEAR SUNSET AND THE INCLUSION OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON WILDFIRE SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS. LIMITING THE BILL TO THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN DOES DESIGNATED AS VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES. ENSURING THAT THESE IMPROVEMENTS WERE IMPROVEMENTS ARE JUST THAT IMPROVEMENTS TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE BUILDING OUR HOME. AND WILL NOT BE USED AS A WAY TO DO RECONSTRUCTION ARE REBUILDING. AFTER A DISASTER AND ENSURING THAT THE PROPERTY OWNER KNOWS THAT IT'S HIS OR HER RESPONSIBILITY TO CONTACT THEIR INSURANCE PROVIDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE WELFARE SAFETY IMPROVEMENT TO BE FINANCED BY THE PACE ASSESSMENT IS COVERED BY THE INSURANCE PLAN. BUT THOSE CHANGES I'M PLEASED TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. THANK YOU MADAM MUCH SHARE IT WITHOTHER CLOSE MEMBERS VERY BRIEFLY I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK ON THIS I THINK THIS IS A GOOD BILL. TO DEAL WITH A PROBLEM THAT WE'VE GOT TO ADDRESS SOONER RATHER THAN LATER ON I'M REMINDED THE ESCROW OFFICERS TO REALTORS THEIR CONCERNS. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BUSINESS OF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ANY HOMES. AND SO ARE WE TRIED BALANCE THIS AS BEST WE CAN TO PROTECT THE CONSUMER. TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THESE CONCERNS ARE ADDRESS WHICH IS WHY THE BILL IS CONTINGENT UPON THOSE REFORMS TAKING PLACE. AND WITHOUT ON BEHALF OF MY CONSTITUENTS AND I SUSPECT THE PEOPLE AROUND THE STATE. AS WE LOOK AT WHAT'S GONNA COME NEXT -- THIS IS A REALLY CRITICAL WAY FOR AS TO EMPOWER OURSELVES TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE THE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE SEEING IN OUR STATE TODAY WITH THAT I'D ASK YOUR IPHONE.
