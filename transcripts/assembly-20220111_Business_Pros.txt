HI GOOD MORNING JERRY MEMBERS OF THE COURT BLACKBURN OF ELIGIBLES NABS THE CALLING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TOW TRUCK ASSOCIATION A SPONSORED IN A REPORT- INITIALLY JUST WANNA THANK A MEMBER SANTIAGO OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT BILL AS WELL AS YOUR PERMANENT STAFF. PROVIDING US WITH EXCELLENT FEEDBACK ANNOUNCEMENTS. I THINK YOU D. A. SEVEN UP TO SPONSOR A BETWEEN A QUARTER TRAFFIC OVERSIGHT IN CALIFORNIA THE LACK OF A STATE WIDE ENTITY REGULATING THE TOWING INDUSTRY. WELL HERE ARE NUMBER CONSUMER PROTECTIONS PROVIDED UNDER CURRENT LAW THERE'S A LACK OF ENFORCEMENT TO PREVENT BAD ACTORS IN INDUSTRY FROM CIRCUMVENT A LOT. FURTHER VEHICLE OWNERS OFTENTIMES LEFT INFUSED AND WITHOUT USING RECORDS OFFICIALLY THEY WERE OVER. CHARGING THE VEHICLES TO- AB T. NINE FOUR WITH. THIS OVERSIGHT ENACTING A PERCENT ON THE- TO SOME. IN THE- TONES PART FOR THE STILL. OF TOKYO CAL BUT YOU APPLY A VEHICLE CAL AND- TERM FROM THE BOY. AND THE BOARD WITHOUT THAT THE TO SUSPEND THE PRIMARY STYLISH BUT LAW- AND THE COME IN THE HOUSE OF ETHNIC. ORDER CALM BECAUSE INFORMATION. AND AUTHORIZED. STORY H. ALL OF WHICH BE POSTED THE BOARD'S WEB FURTHER IN ORDER JUST OVER BILLION THE BILL AND I OF THREE IN THE- WE'RE BACK INTO CAN SWIM RECOVERED ANY FEES. AND ATHLETICALLY THAT WERE IN A CAR PAID ON TOP CLASS PENALTIES. THE CONSUMERS PRISON TO BE RIGHT WITHIN THE SYSTEM. AND THE TELLING COMPANY AS A PARTNER. A PROVEN FACT QUITE LEGAL. THIS PROCESS WOULD ADD PETER THAT'S LAWS THAT REQUIRE INCOME TO BUY BY THEIR- APPROACH RATES BY. WHICH WAS NOT. AND THAT'S A BILL TO LEGAL TELL THE IN THE STATE. OVERALL WE WILL THIS BILL THE CRITICAL STEP TO CURBING ATTACK THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANNEX OF SERRA TAYLOR. IN BETTER PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM THE ABUSES AND EXORBITANT CHARGES IN THE TOWING AND AUTO REPAIR INDUSTRIES. NOT SURPRISINGLY THE TOTAL BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA IS LARGELY UNREGULATED AND THERE'S NO RELIABLE DATABASE OF TOTAL VEHICLES OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA% IDENTIFY BAD ACTORS AND TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WHEN APPROPRIATE SO WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND COMMEND THE CALIFORNIA TOW TRUCK ASSOCIATION FOR COMING FORWARD WITH A PROPOSAL TO PUT SOME ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND THE TOWING INDUSTRY. TO PROTECT THE CONSUMERS AND READ OUT THE BAD APPLES. YEAH IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING OVERSIGHT FOR TOWERS. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE EXCESSIVE STORAGE RATES CHARGED BY OUR REPAIR DEALERS. WHILE MOST AUTO BODY REPAIR DEALERS ARE RESPONSIBLE WE'RE STILL SEEING TOO MANY THAT ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF CONSUMERS AND CHARGING EXCESSIVE RAGE THAT COST INSURANCE POLICY HOLDER YOU'RE JUST PLAIN DOLLARS. AND PERPETUATE A CYCLE OF POVERTY FOR THE LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO CAN AFFORD TO PAY STORAGE BILLS AND YOUR CAR'S AND SOMETIMES THEIR LIVELIHOOD. DOCTORS ARGUES THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS WORKING FINE TO PROTECT CONSUMER. BUT OUR RESEARCH INDICATES THAT'S NOT THE CASE. WE FIND IT STILL COMMON FOR AUTO REPAIR DEALERS TO CHARGE STORAGE FEES ARE IN EXCESS OF TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER DAY. AND SOMETIMES IN EXCESS OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY. BY COMPARISON STORAGE RATE PAID BY CHP AND HIGH COST CITIES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO IS NINETY THREE DOLLARS PER DAY. CURRENTLY THERE'S NO REGULATOR THAT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DEFINE REASONABLE STORAGE RATES. OR REQUIRE AN UNSCRUPULOUS BUSINESS TO CONSUMER PROCESSING CHARGES. THE ONLY REMEDY FOR CONSUMER MARKETS TO BRING A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE TOWING STORAGE FACILITY FOR DAMAGES. THAT'S NOT PRACTICAL FOR MOST PEOPLE. WHEN CLOSING. AB TWO NINETY FOUR WILL PROVIDE THE REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY LACKING IN THE TOWING INDUSTRY. AND ESTABLISH A FAIR AND RESPONSIBLE STORAGE WAIT BENCHMARK THAT IS BASED ON REGIONAL H. NEGOTIATED BY THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN MY VOTE. THANK YOU THINK THANKS SO MUCH I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO- PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION JACK MORE THAN OFF MALATI MILLOT AN OFFICE USE ME. WE TESTIFYING VIA TELEPHONE AND JOE COLLINS WHO I BELIEVE IS TESTIFYING IN PERSON. ONE WE GO FIRST- AND THEN WE'LL GO TO JOE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING- COMMITTEE- CARE. PROJECT MODOC ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA AUTOBODY ASSOCIATION THE AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE COUNCIL CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS COALITION WERE OPPOSED UNLESS BILL COMMENDED. THE BILL IS NOT NECESSARY WITH REGARD TO AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR DEALER'S AUTOMOTIVE WITH CAR DEALERS ON THE BUSINESS OF REPAIRING CARS. AND ARE AND ARE REGULATED BY THE BUREAU OF AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR S. B. A. R. YOU COULD IN ANY STORAGE FEES THEY MAY CHARGE. THE TOWING INDUSTRY IS NOT REGULATED BY THE B. A. R. THE TOWING INDUSTRY AND THE AUTO REPAIR INDUSTRY A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. THE BUREAU OF AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR. RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN THOUSAND CONSUMER COMPLAINT HERE HOW TO. OKAY CONSUMER COMPLAINT ONLY. ARE RELATED JUST. EVEN THOUGH THE NUMBER IS VERY LOW B. A. R. TREATS THE STORE COMPLAINTS SERIOUSLY THE INVESTIGATED MEDIATE AND HAVE TAKEN DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR DEALER'S RELATED STORAGE IS USED. AB FOUR SEVENTY ONE WHICH PASSED LAST YEAR IT WAS A LOW BILL IT TOOK EFFECT JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. WHICH STRENGTHENS AND PROVIDES ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY TO BE A ARE OVER AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR SHOPS WITH REGARD STORAGE IN FACT THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF PROMULGATING STORAGE REGULATIONS AND THEY JUST HELD A WORKSHOP IN OCTOBER. THERE'S NO NEED TO CREATE ANOTHER REGULATORY BOARD TO AGREE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR DEALER'S TO DEAL WITH ONLY SIXTY STORAGE COMPLAINT. WE ARE REQUESTING THE BILL BE AMENDED TO EXCLUDE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR DEALER'S THAT DO NOT HAVE TO- TRUCKS AND INSTEAD. WORK WITH THE BUREAU OF AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR TO IMPROVE AND STRENGTHEN STORAGE ISSUES THROUGH THE PENDING REGULATORY PROCESS. WE THINK THIS IS A MUCH BETTER APPROACH ALSO THE BILL PROHIBITS AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR DEALER FROM CHARGING FAIR IN MOVIES MORE STORAGE RATE. LAW IF THAT IS CONDITIONS FOR WEEDS MORE STORAGE RATE THE LAW CREATED AT YEARS AGO BY SOME SAKE. BILL A TWENTY THREE TWO ALL THE STATE CALL AND THIS. OF THIS BILL NEGOTIATED THE STORAGE WAIT DEFINITIONS THE STATE. LAW PROVIDES THAT AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR DEALER'S MAY CHARGE REASONABLE RATES WHICH ARE DETERMINED BY COMPARING RATES TO OTHER SHOPS IN THE LOCAL AREA. TOLD TRUCK. THEIR THEIR RATES ARE DETERMINED AND GOVERNED BY THEIR NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS WITH C. H. P. AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE DEATH LAW NOT A LIMIT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND LET'S GO TO JOE COLLINS AND THEN AFTER JOE ALL DO THE ME TOOS WHICH I SKIPPED EARLIER- SO WE'LL GO BACK TO ME TO USE IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION. THANKS JEFF. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER CHOKE FUNDS I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION LICENSE REPOSSESSIONS. THIS BILL IS ABOUT FOUR THINGS. IT'S ABOUT REGULATING TOW TRUCKS. IT'S ABOUT REGULATING TELL VEHICLES. IT'S ABOUT REGULATING STORAGE TRUCK YOU STORAGE YARD. AND IT'S ABOUT THE LIEN SALE PROCESS. ALL OF THESE THE CALIFORNIA TOW TRUCK ASSOCIATION WILL STAND TO MAKE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IF YOU ALLOW THIS BILL TO LEAVE YOUR COMMITTEE. THEY WANT TO REGULATE TE TOW TRUCK. YOU HAVE TO GO BE CERTIFIED AS A TOWER IN THE ONLY PERSON THAT CERTIFIES IN THE STATE IS A CALIFORNIA TOW TRUCK ASSOCIATION. THEY ALSO CERTIFY THE AUTOMOBILE CLUB OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THEY RUN THAT PROGRAM TO CERTIFY TRUCKS. SO THEY GET THIS BILL PASSED. THEY MAKE MONEY. BILLION CELL PROCESS IF YOU LOOK AT THE CODE THIS BILL IF THEY WROTE IT SAYS THAT THEY GET TO. REGULATE THE LIEN SALE PROCESS. WELL I'M SURE THE DEPARTMENT OF AIRPORTS WOULD WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THEY FILED LIENS. I'M SURE THE LEAGUE OF CITIES WOULD WANT TO HEAR IT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY SHOULD HEARD THIS BILL BUT THE WAY THEY WROTE IT. YOU WOULD THINK IT ONLY PERTAINS TO TELLING BUT IT DOES NOT IT'S THE ENTIRE LIEN SALE PROCESS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE BUREAU OF SECURITY INVESTIGATOR SERVICES REGULATES REPOSSESSION AGENCY. WERE IN THE BOOK. WE'RE REGULATED BY THE DCA WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THE FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT WE DON'T EVEN BELONG IN THIS ACT BECAUSE WE DON'T CHARGE TOWING AND STORAGE WE REPOSSESS THE CAR GOES THROUGH A LOT THE FINANCE COMPANY DETERMINES WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH IT WHERE IT GOES AND THAT'S ALL MANDATED BY THE CALIFORNIA COMMERCIAL CODE. THERE'S NOTHING WE DO THAT WOULD PUT US HERE AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT THE AUTO THIS MEMBERS DO THAT WOULD PUT THEM IN THIS EITHER BUT THEY DREADED TELL VEHICLE AND THEY JUST- JUNK CARS A PART AMOUNT MAKE SURE THEY SHOULDN'T BE IN THIS BILL. THIS BILL IS A WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING AND THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS ARE GONNA GET HURT I PASSED MANY BILLS FOR THIS COMMITTEE AND I GOTTA TELL YEAH. IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT BEING FOR AND RE. YOUR THE GATEKEEPERS YOU'RE THE ONES THAT HAVE THE MISSION STATEMENT THAT SAYS WE REPRESENT THE CONSUMER. THERE HAS TO BE FAIR IT HAS TO BE REASONABLE. EVERY RATE THEY HAVE IN THEIR ACT. CAN BE VOTE INVALIDATED BY SAYING YES THEY DIDN'T CHARGE THE RIGHT RATE BUT WE BELIEVE IT'S REASONABLE. AND THAT'S IT THAT'S A WRAP YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING. AND IF YOU DO DISPUTED IF YOUR AUTO INSURANCE COMPANY. OR A REPOSSESSION YOU DISPUTED. AND THEY SAY YES YOU'RE CORRECT. YOU DON'T EVEN GET YOUR MONEY BACK IF YOU PAID FOR THE CAR HE JUST SAID IT TO THE REGISTERED OWNER. YOU DON'T GET YOUR MONEY BACK.

YEAH WHICH IS AB SIX SEVENTY SIX- BY SOMEONE NUMBER HOLDEN BUT BY PRESENTED BY THE ESTEEMED ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM. IT IS AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE TO HAVE YOU HERE TODAY SIR. AND LIKEWISE MEMBERS- I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AB SIX SEVENTY SIX TODAY ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN THAT WHEN THAT TERRIBLE PROBST ASKS I'M INCLINED TO SAY YES SMART MAN THE MOMENT THE WHOLE TAKE A NUMBER OF STEPS TO RECTIFY THE UNBALANCED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FRANCHISEE AND FRANCHISOR YOURS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN AUTHORED AB FIVE TWENTY FIVE WHICH MADE CALIFORNIA THE STANDARD BEARER OF FAIRNESS FOR THE FRANCHISE OR FRANCHISEE RELATIONSHIP. WELL AB FIVE TWENTY FIVE IMPROVE THESE RELATIONSHIPS THERE IS STILL MORE WORK TO DO TO BRING FAIRNESS TO THE SYSTEM WHICH IS WHY AB SIX SEVENTY SIX AS NECESSARY. THE BILL DOES MULTIPLE THINGS TO RESOLVE ISSUES IT EXPLICITLY PROHIBITS FRANCHISE SOURCE FROM INFLUENCING WHERE FRANCHISEE CAN PURCHASE A FRANCHISE BASED ON A PROTECTED CLASS SUCH AS RACE. RECENT REPORTS ON LAWSUITS AGAINST MCDONALD'S BY AFRICAN AMERICAN FRANCHISEES DETAIL THIS ONGOING ISSUE. SOME FRANCHISORS HAVE USED THE PANDEMIC AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THEIR LIABILITY THE TRANSFER BURDEN ON TO FRANCHISEES IN EXCHANGE FOR FINANCIAL HELP. THE BILL PROHIBITS THAT. CURRENTLY FRANCHISE DOORS CAN UNILATERALLY DETERMINE THE AMOUNT THAT FRANCHISEES ARE WHEN AN AGREEMENT IS BEING TERMINATED OR NOT RENEWED. THIS BILL CREATES A MORE FAIR PROCESS WHERE BOTH PARTIES HAVE A SAY. A TRANSFER BY OUR OF A FRANCHISE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BEFORE TWENTY SIXTEEN WILL NOT RECEIVE THE PROTECTIONS ESTABLISHED BY AB FIVE TWENTY FIVE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE SIGNING A NEW FRANCHISE CONTRACT AFTER THE LAW'S ENACTMENT AND THIS BILL ENABLES THAT. IT WILL ALSO INCLUDE ADEQUATE DISCLOSURES AND ENSURE THAT ALL FRANCHISE. FRANCHISORS AND FRANCHISEES IN CALIFORNIA ARE COVERED BY THE LAW ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE KEITH MILLER WHO REPRESENTS THE FRANCHISEES IS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB SIX SEVENTY SIX AND- THANKFULLY.

ALSO SERVED AS THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND ENGAGEMENT FOR THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF FRANCHISEES AND DEALERS. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I'VE BEEN A SUBWAY FRANCHISEE IN CALIFORNIA SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT. CURRENTLY WITH THREE LOCATIONS IN GRASS VALLEY IN AUBURN. SO YES I HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME SO TO SPEAK. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL WITH A SIMPLE TO BUILD ON AND BETTER CLARIFY WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST TO PROVIDE GREATER TRANSPARENCY. AND ULTIMATELY PROTECT THE FRANCHISEE INVESTOR IN CALIFORNIA. WE NEED TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA LAW CAN'T BE WAIVED ON FRANCHISE IS LOCATED IN THE STATE. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT PROSPECTIVE FRANCHISEES BUYING INTO AN EXISTING. FRANCHISE UNDERSTAND THE APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS AND THE FRANCHISE OR FOLLOWS THOSE STANDARDS. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT FRANCHISEES ARE TREATED EQUALLY WITH RESPECT TO APPROVAL OR FINANCIAL. NO MATTER WHAT THEIR CHARACTERISTICS ARE OR THE COMPOSITION OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD YES. WE NEED TO ENSURE FRANCHISE ALL HOURS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR VIOLATIONS OF STATE FRANCHISE LAWS IF ANY OFFICER AGENT OR EMPLOYEE VIOLATES THE STATUTES AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT DISCLAIMERS ARE NOT USED TO HIDE VIOLATIONS OF THE FRANCHISE INVESTMENT LAW. THESE ARE THE PRIMARY GOALS OF AB SIX SEVEN SIX AS MENTIONED WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS WE DID TALK I DID TALK TO THEIR REPRESENTATIVE ON FRIDAY AND I KNOW THE ONE CONCERN WE HAVE LANGUAGE THAT WE CAN CLARIFY THEIR CONCERN. I LOOK FOR CONTINUING THIS DISCUSSION AND ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS TODAY THANK YOU. GET THIS PROCESS RIGHT. THE LAST BILL ANYBODY ELSE WANTS TO ADD ON- IN SUPPORT OF THE- SIX SEVENTY SIX- ANYBODY IN.

SEEKING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN CLEARLY IDENTIFIED- AND ATTEMPTS TO AMEND LANGUAGE THAT WAS PAINSTAKINGLY NEGOTIATED CRAFTED AND AGREED UPON.

IS THAT RIGHT- AND THEN WE'LL I THINK IT'S I GALLAGHER- BUT LET'S MOVE ON TO. AB ELEVEN TWENTY BY OUR OWN COMMITTEE MEMBER. THAT'S ON NUMBER ONE. MOVIOLA. GOT A MOTION AS AND A COUPLE OF. SAID ALL ALLOW TWENTY ALLOW HEALTH FACILITIES AND HOSPITALS TO AUTHORIZE THE USE OF NEW BLOOD COLLECTION METHODS AND DEVICES CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE THAT REQUIRES PHLEBOTOMIST TO USE NEEDLES TO DRAW BLOOD EVEN THOUGH NEW NEEDLELESS BLOOD COLLECTION METHODS EXIST. CALIFORNIA PATIENTS DESERVE GREATER ACCESS TO NEW MEDICAL PRACTICES THAT ARE SAFE AND MORE COMFORTABLE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I'M SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS IS THIS FALL MY DAUGHTER IN LAW WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR THREE WEEKS AND SHE HAD AN IV LINE.ISA DAY. THE PHLEBOTOMIST CAME IN TO DRAW BLOOD. AND TO- OFTEN THEY COULDN'T FIND THE VEINS THEY WERE GOING FROM ONE ARM TO THE OTHER ARM. A DEVICE LIKE THIS WOULD HAVE MADE HER MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE. WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH- OF PEOPLE THAT HAD CONCERNS OF OVER THE FALL AND- IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE TOOK ONE OF- CLARIFIES THAT'S THE HOSPITAL DOES HAVE TO PROVIDE TRAINING FOR THE PHLEBOTOMIST IT IS THAT THEIR OPTION TO USE. THIS TECHNIQUE. AND ALSO THERE WAS SOME QUESTION ABOUT- THE NURSES- BEING IN CHARGE OF THE PERIPHERAL INTRAVENOUS CATHETER AND WE HAVE VERY EXPLICITLY STATED. THAT PHLEBOTOMIST ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO MANAGE STOP OR RESTART A PATIENT'S ACTIVE INTERVENE AS INFUSION. OR REMOVE A PERIPHERAL INTRAVENOUS CATHETER AND THE LANGUAGE GOES EVEN FURTHER TO EMPHASIZE THAT A PHYSICIAN AND SURGEON OR A REGISTERED NURSE MAY RESTRICT OR LIMIT PHLEBOTOMY PHLEBOTOMY TECHNICIANS ABILITY TO COLLECT BLOOD. FROM THESE DEVICES SO- WITH ME TODAY I HAVE THAT TO EXPERTS- IN SUPPORT DR P. TO. AND DEVELOP A DEV GONE OF THE LOT OF VASCULAR AND RYAN SPENCER REPRESENTING- BECTON DICKINSON AND COMPANY. SALAS THANK YOU AS A MEMBER IRWIN- SO LET'S MOVE TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- DR DRIVE GONE- AND RENTS A- WHO I THINK SORRY ARE BOTH THAT'S FINE VIA PHONE IS THAT RIGHT. ABOUT DR LET'S GO TO THE- THAT I'M SORRY DR A P. TO DEF CON IS ONE PERSON. YES YES THE DOCTOR NEVER GONE. IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE VIA PHONE PLEASE GO AHEAD AND- START YOUR TEST MANY OF TWO MINUTES. CAN YOU ALL HEAR ME WITHOUT IT UP ON I CAN'T WE CAN'T THANK YOU YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER EARLY MY NAME IS DR PD DOT COM I AM THE INVENTOR OF AN FDA CLEARED- NEEDLE FREE BLOOD DRAW TECHNOLOGY CALLED TIVO. PEOPLE THE SINGLE USE DISPOSABLE DEVICE TO TEMPORARILY CONNECT TO HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS PERIPHERAL IV CATHETER TO ENABLE VIRTUALLY PAINLESS AND RELIABLE BLOOD DRIVE. THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY INCLUDING CALIFORNIA ARE ADOPTING IV CATHETER BUT- COLLECTION TECHNOLOGY WITH PEOPLE TO IMPROVE THEIR PATIENTS EXPERIENCE BY ELIMINATING PAINFUL NEEDLES REDUCE THE RISK OF NEEDLESTICK INJURIES FOR THEIR STAFF MEMBERS. IMPROVE LAB EFFICIENCY BY REDUCING THE HOSPITAL'S REJECTED- BLOOD SAMPLE RATE. THERE'S ROBUST EVIDENCE SUPPORTING BLOOD DRAWS FROM IV CATHETERS WITH PEOPLE INCLUDING SIX PEER REVIEWED JOURNAL PUBLICATIONS. OR QUICKLY HIGHLIGHT THE MOST RECENTLY PUBLISHED LARGEST REAL WORLD STUDY EVER OF A NEEDLE FREE BLOOD DRAW- TECHNOLOGY LIKE OURS CONDUCTED BY INTERMOUNTAIN HEALTHCARE. THERE THE LARGEST HOSPITAL SYSTEM IN UTAH THAT MAKES IT REALLY CLOSE CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTING FOR MORE THAN 50% OF ALL THE BEDS IN THE STATE. LIKE MOST MOST LARGE HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS THEY RELY ON THEIR PHLEBOTOMIST TO COLLECT THE MAJORITY OF THEIR INPATIENT BLOOD SAMPLES. THE TRACTOR PHLEBOTOMIST USING PEOPLE ACROSS TWENTY TWO OF THE HOSPITAL OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD NOT COMPASS TWO HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND PATIENT ADMISSIONS. WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE LARGEST STUDY OF ITS KIND FOR THE. VOTE EVER. R. D. PUBLISHED I NEED POLLUTED A FIFTY SIX FOR THE- IN BLOOD STEM REJECT RATES. AND NINETEEN PER LESS I THE ROOF. RATE TO SUMMARIZE. THE BOTTOM INSTEAD STATE FULLY AND OFFICIALLY PERFORM NEEDLE FREE BLOOD DRAWS AND ACTUALLY IMPROVED IV CATHETER OUTCOMES SIMULTANEOUSLY. IN ADDITION THE PUBLIC STUDIES PEABO USES CROPPING TWO AND A HALF MILLION PERFORMED DRAWS THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE CONDUCTED BY TRAIN FULL BOTANISTS AND OTHER STATES. HAVE BEEN ZERO ADVERSE EVENT EVER REPORTED SUGGESTED REGIONAL FDA CLEARANCE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. PATIENT SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT IN THIS NEW PROCEDURE STILL HAS NURSING A CONTROL OF THE PATIENT'S IV CATHETER. THE PHLEBOTOMIST WILL NEVER START STOP OR PAUSE ANY RUNNING IV INFUSIONS AND THEY WILL NT BE INSERTING OR REMOVING ANY IV% CATHETERS. AND LASTLY ALSO BOUGHT A MISS ANDERSON IS COMPLETE IN PERSON TRAINING AND DEMONSTRATE COMPETENCY TO PERFORM THE PROCEDURE SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY. IN CALIFORNIA TODAY THE MAJORITY OF BLOOD DRAWS ARE CONDUCTED BY PHLEBOTOMIST AND THIS BILL WILL ENABLE THEM IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR NURSE COLLEAGUES UTILIZED THE STATE FOR AND MORE HUMANE. PROCEDURE HIGHER YOU TO VOTE I THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT WE SHOULD HAVE RYAN SPENCER THE GARAGE WHICH AVAIL FOR QUESTIONS WITH SPENCER I'M SORRY. ON BEHALF OF THE BECTON DICKSON AND COMPANY A CASES FOR KATE AND THEN HAD A WIN SO **** AND SUPPORT AND HERE TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS AS WELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT ON THE PHONES. SUPPORT FOR AB ELEVEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. OF AB ELEVEN TWENTY. I HAVE NO ONE TO END UP IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE MOST OF TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- FIRST WITNESS CURTIS LANG. FROM CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION. YES GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN RESPONDED CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND REGISTERED NURSE IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE CURRENTLY OPPOSED AB ELEVEN TWENTY. FIRST I'M NOT STATING THEIR PARTICIPATION ADVOCATES YOU NAY IS NOT OPPOSED TO THAT BASKING IN TECHNOLOGY THAT MINIMIZES PATIENT NEEDLE STICKS QUITE THE CONTRARY NURSES ARE VERY COMPASSIONATE ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS AND I'M HERE TO PROVIDE AND WILL DO ALL THAT WE CAN TO MINIMISE PAIN TRAUMA. AND TRAUMA EXPERIENCED BY THE PATIENTS HOWEVER DO OPPOSE THE USE OF UNLICENSED AND ENACT WE TRAIN THE BOTTOM IS TO USE THIS TECHNOLOGY TO ACCESS PERIPHERAL MANY FAMOUS CHARACTERS THE PURPOSE OF WITHDRAWING BLOOD. FROM PATIENTS RECEIVING INFUSION THERAPY. PROCEDURES BEYOND THE SCOPE OF AUTOMATIC AND DOES THAT HIS- AND POSES A THREAT TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY. OF HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS. THE EDUCATE REQUIRED THE PROPER CARE FROM THAT'S THE CARE AND MANAGE. OF PERIPHERALLY IN. INTO CATHETER AND OTHER STILL. TRAININGS ASSEMBLY BALANCE. SINCE THAT THE BOTTOM CAN SAVE USE AND APPARATUS WITH BUT I'VE CATHETER BUT I THINK EDUCATION TO CARE FOR AND THEN IT CAP IN THE SENSE REQUIRE TO DRAW BLOOD SAFELY FROM NINETY. THE INSERTION OF IN CTHETERS THE POST INSERTION OF THE INTRAVENOUS AB AND THE MANAGEMENT OF INTRAVENOUS INFUSIONS IS A PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF DIRECT CARE REGISTERED NURSE CANNOT BE DELEGATED TO UNLICENSED PERSONNEL THE ANSWER OF AN INTRAVENOUS CATHETER INTO A PATIENT'S CREATES A PATHWAY DIRECTLY INTO THE VENICE BLOODSTREAM IT REQUIRES EXCELLENT TECHNIQUE BOTH FOR THE INSERTION AND PROPOSED INSERTION MANAGEMENT OF THE CATHETER AND THE CAP THEIR INSERTION SITE IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE LIKELIHOOD OF INFECTION OR THE INTRODUCTION OF BACTERIA. DIRECTLY INTO THE BLOODSTREAM THAT IS WHY IT IS THE GOAL EVERY ARE AND IS THERE A PROTECT EVERY PERIPHERALLY INSERTED CATHETER IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ADMINISTER PHYSICIAN OR IV THERAPY INCLUDE ID MEDICATION AND TO AVOID HAVING TO REPLACE THE IDEA AFTER AUGMENTATION ADDITIONAL PAIN AND DISCOMFORT FOR THAT REASON THE MANAGEMENT OF THE INTRAVENOUS SITE AND ACCESS TO THE INTERCHANGEABLE TO PHYSICIANS AND LICENSED NURSE IN THE HIGH POPULOUS SETTING. SO THE QUESTION IS WHY DO WE NEED THIS LEGISLATION THANKS TO THE ALREADY USING THIS TECHNOLOGY IN CALIFORNIA TO MINIMIZE PATIENT NEEDLE STICKS THANK YOU CARRILLO MEMBERS LIKE TO DIVIDE IT PLEASE ENTER AND CANNOT CURRENTLY USING IT TO MINIMIZE PATIENT NEEDLES AS WE BOTH KNOW TODAY. THANKS VERY MUCH FOR AND NEXT UP WE HAVE JETS AMOUNT FROM CALIFORNIA FOR THE- ON THE PHONE AS WELL YOU CAN YOU ARE TWO MINUTES FOR YOUR TEST. ADULT THANK YOU I WELCOME BERMAN. GOOD MORNING MY- NAME IS JEFF VALLEY BUT BUT- LABOR FOR. AND REST. BUT STRONG UP. TO AP ELEVEN. CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION REPRESENTS TWO POINT ONE MILLION UNION MEMBERS INCLUDING AFFILIATES REPRESENT BEGAN THAT OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS SUCH AS NURSES PHLEBOTOMIST AND DOCTORS. THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE IS IMPLICATED BY THE FILM. REGRETTABLY WE ARE IN THE POSITION OF HAVING TO OPPOSE THE LATEST ITERATION OF THE BILL WHICH HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO THE LEGISLATURE BY SINGLE HEALTHCARE DEVICE MANUFACTURER. VILLADA VASCULAR WHOSE SOLE AIM IS TO GET PEOPLE DEVICE AND TO AS MANY CLINICAL CARE SETTING OFF BOMBS. ASSEMBLY WE THINK THIS IS AN UNNECESSARY CHANGE TWIN NURSES OF PRACTICE. SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF SELLING MORE DEVICES AND MAXIMIZING PROFIT. RIGHT NOW NURSES ALREADY CAN AND DO USE PEOPLE DEVICES SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY IN CALIFORNIA. THE SPONSORS HAVE NEVER DENIED THAT. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE PEOPLE DEVICES ONLY A COUPLE OF YEARS VENOUS CATHETER WHICH FOR GOOD REASON BELONGS WITH THE NURSES PERFUME. A LOT OF VASCULAR JUST TO CHANGE THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE. TO ALLOW UNLICENSED THE BOTTOM IS TO ACCESS UNITS CAPTURED. WE SLIGHTLY SPONSORS THAT THAT THEY HAVE NOT SOLVED FOR OUR CONCERN ABOUT LICENSURE IMPLICATIONS. WERE ONLY ALERTED FOR THE BILL LAST WEEK AND UNFORTUNATELY THE FEDERATION AND OUR AFFILIATES WERE NOT INCLUDED IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR ON FILE. AS A PHLEBOTOMIST WITH UNLICENSED IF YOU SAYS THAT PEOPLE DIVIDE THE LICENSE APPLICATIONS TRACK WITH A HIGHER TIER LICENSE PROFESSIONAL WHETHER THAT BE A NURSE A LAB SCIENTIST OR DOCTOR BIKE A TO. ROLE FOR THE LICENSE ON ALREADY STRESSED AND OVERWORKED MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. ARE FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR NO VOTE ON AB ELEVEN TWENTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANNOUNCER ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WANT TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION TO AB ELEVEN TWENTY. ANY WITNESSES IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WANT TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IN TWENTY SEEING NONE.

GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STOPS MY NAME IS TO STOP MAYOR AND I'M CALLING ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE. COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES WE ARE OPPOSED TO AB ELEVEN TWENTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HEALTH CARE. ACTUAL EACH SHAPE UP. AND NEXT WILL LINE NUMBER. FORTY FIVE PLEASE WAIT. HI I'M OPPOSING ON THE OF ALL THE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE QUEUED UP AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO WITH THAT LET'S BRING BACK A COLLEAGUES FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS DO WE HAVE A WE HAVE A MOTION A SECOND FAMILY I BELIEVE- ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MR GRAYSON. THANK YOU CHAIR BERMAN AND- OF. REASON MY PART I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS OF PLEASE IF I MAY THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR OUR- AND I HAD TO STEP OUT DURING A PRESENTATION- IT WAS PRESENTING IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE. ARE PHLEBOTOMIST- ARE THEY LICENSED THERE BECAUSE WHAT I HEAR- UNLICENSED PHLEBOTOMIST SO- DO WE HAVE. OUR FULL BOTTOM IS LICENSE AND WHAT IS THE SCOPE. OF THAT LICENSURE IN REFERENCE TO A BLOOD DRAW USING THIS PARTICULAR DEVICE NO I'M GONNA HAVE- START WITH DOCTOR DAD GONE IF HE WANTS TO ADDRESS. THIS QUESTION. BYLER THANK YOU SO IN A NUMBER AND IS NOT YOUR YOU W. SO- INTEL. THEY ARE FORCED ON THE THAT EITHER HAVE A- REQUIRED FOR FOOTBALL. OR IT'S SORT OF. WHICH OPERATING SAID TO LICENSE CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THEM. SO YES THEY ARE THEY ARE CERTIFIED THEY HAVE A SCOPE AND THEY HAVE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS- AND THAT THAT WOULD CALIFORNIA'S. SO THE THAT TRAINING AND THIS MAY BE TOWARD THE DOCTOR AS WELL. AS THAT TREATING- RESULT AND- THAT IS SPECIFIC TO THIS DEVICE A BLOOD DRAW DOES THAT TRAINING RESULT IN CERTIFICATION. ON TOP OF THE LICENSE SINCE IT THIS IS A TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS COME AFTER. THEY MOST LIKELY WERE LICENSED THAT- ALL START AND THEN LET ME- DOCTORED TO HAVE GONE FINISH THAT THE TRAINEES SO IF THE HOSPITAL WANTS TO UTILIZE THIS TECHNOLOGY. THEY ARE THE ONES THAT WILL DO THE TRAINING FOR THE TECHNOLOGY AND I KNOW YOU'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT LIABILITY LIABILITY WOULD BE ON THE PHLEBOTOMIST AND THE HOSPITAL IF THEY DID NOT. PROVIDE ADEQUATE TRAINING. AND BY ALL I ALSO WANT TO. REITERATE THAT SAYS YES THIS IS A NEW DEVICE BUT IT'S BEEN. TWO AND A HALF MILLION TIMES. AND OVER HALF OF THOSE TIMES IT WAS BY A PHLEBOTOMIST. SO DR DEF CON I'M NOT SURE IF YOU HAVE MORE TO ADD TO THAT. WELL I'M NOT REALLY OF THE SOME OF THE CAPITAL BOTANIST LEARN IS. OF THEIR CERTIFICATION IS DONE AND BY IN FULL BOTTOM ME SCHOOL ARE CONTROLLED BY THE STATE. AND SOME OF IT IS ACTED ON BY THE HOSPITAL FACILITIES IN THE CURRENT WAY THE STATUTES ARE WRITTEN. AND SO IT'S BOTH IT'S KIND OF SPLIT DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU HAVE TO LEARNING SO IT'S VERY COMMON FOR A LOT OF US TO HAVE ON THE JOB TRAINING. IN CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL TODAY. SO AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHEN YOU ANSWERED- PART OF. PART OF MY QUESTION MY NEXT QUESTION WAS ABOUT THE LIABILITY BECAUSE- THERE ARE LICENSURE IMPLICATIONS. AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S NOT A DOCTOR OR A NURSE THAT'S RETURNING WHETHER PHLEBOTOMIST ISSUES IT'S REALLY. AN ADMINISTRATOR OF A HOSPITAL THAT DETERMINES. AND SO AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE LICENSOR IMPLICATIONS WHAT. ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR LICENSURE IF THERE IS SOMETHING THAT GOES AWRY. SO DOCTORS HAVE GONE DO YOU MIND ANSWERING THAT. SURE OF COURSE BOB SO FULL BOTTOM IS WORK FOR THE LABORATORY IN THE HOSPITAL MAY WORK UNDER THE DIRECT SUPERVISION OF THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR WITH THE POSITION OF THE LABORATORY OF THE HOSPITAL. SO THAT THAT WOULD BE THE PERSON ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FIRST. OVERSEEING THEM THE SUPERVISING THEM. SO THEN IF A NURSE OR A DOCTOR IS PRESENT AND AVAILABLE WHAT WOULD BE THE BENEFIT FOR THE ADVANTAGE OF USING A PHLEBOTOMIST OVER A NURSE OR A DOCTOR. THERE IS NOT NECESSARILY A BENEFIT IN IN GENERAL IN LARGE HOSPITALS A NURSES ARE NOT DOING THE BLOOD DRAWS SO IF THERE IS A NURSE OR A DOCTOR AVAILABLE NURSES ARE ALREADY ALLOWED TO USE THESE DEVICES. IT BUT IN BIG HOSPITALS NURSES ARE NOT. YOU KNOW THEY'RE VERY THEY'RE WORKING VERY HARD AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TIME TO DRAW BLOOD AND THAT'S ONE OF THE BOTTOM IS JUST CALL THEM. THANK YOU. THE USER OF AYE SIR FOR THANK YOU THAT CHAIR THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- I'M- AND ACTUALLY KIND OF IN LINE WITH US IMMIGRATION COMMENTS I THINK ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF ALLOWING PHLEBOTOMIST TO DO THIS. IS WE HAVE STAFFING ISSUES RIGHT NOW. WE ALL TALKED ABOUT CODE AND WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. NOTHING IS AGAINST NURSES I MEAN WOULD LOVE NURSES TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS BUT SOMETIMES ARE JUST NOT ENOUGH OF THEM SO TO BE ABLE TO DO. IN MY OPINION AND IN SERVICE TRAINING. TO TEACH A FULL BOTTOM IS HOW TO USE A NEW TECHNOLOGY IS NOT A BAD WAY TO GO EXPECTS THE IN THE IN THE CLIMATE THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. THE MEASURE MEASURE AND I. BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE REALLY. THANK YOU MISTER THEY GIVE US CHAIR I JUST WANT TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRING THIS BILL FOR I UNDERSTAND OBVIOUSLY WANT TO PUT THE COMFORT OF THE PATIENT IT'S PARAMOUNT- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WANTS ONLINE HOSPITAL BED BEING POKED WITH MORE MORE NEEDLES IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. BUT I COME FROM A NURSE FAMILY AND I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THE HESITANCY ABOUT ALLOWING MORE PEOPLE INTO THE- IV STREAM OF FORTUNATELY AS YOU ENCOURAGE ME TALK TO MY MOM SHE ACTUALLY DOES DO BLOOD DRAWS A LARGE HOSPITAL SETTING AND THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THEIR STANDARD PRACTICE AND I UNDERSTAND. THE HESITANCY TO ALLOW ANOTHER PERSON INTO THE IV STREAM SO WHILE THIS BILL I THINK IS LAUDABLE I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY TOTALLY UNDERSTANDING WORLD OF CONCERNS ARE AND MAKING SURE THAT PATIENT SAFETY IS AT THE CORE OF THIS. SO I JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW THAT- I APPRECIATIVE EFFORT BUT I WILL BE ABLE SUPPORT- YOU MISTER LEE AND I. THAT WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE- DISCUSSIONS AHEAD OF TIME ON THIS. THE ISN'T REALLY ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COLLEAGUES ON THE- ON THE COMMITTEE SAYING NONE. A MOVIE BACK- MISSOURI WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THIS SUMMER IN THE ELECTRICALS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO TOOK THE TIME TO WORK WITH WITH ME AND THE COMMITTEE ON THIS BILL. AND I RECOGNIZE THAT SOME CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT VARIOUS ISSUES MOST IMPORTANTLY ABOUT PATIENT SAFETY. LOOKING AT THE PARLIAMENT'S MADE IN THIS COMMITTEE AND AGREED TO BY THE AUTHOR SUCH AS THE ABILITY FOR NURSES TO LIMIT A PHLEBOTOMIST FROM ACCESSING THE IV. I'M COMFORTABLE MOVING THE BILL FOR TODAY HOWEVER I REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ENSURE THERE'S NO MORE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT- ANY ADDITIONAL DETAILS MAY EMERGE AS THE BILL MOVES ALONG- AND FOR THEIR CONVERSATIONS ARE HAD.
