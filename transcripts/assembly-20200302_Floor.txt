THAT BRINGS US TO. FILE ITEM NUMBER FIVE. IT'S ACR ONE SEVENTY EIGHT BY MS RUBIO. CLOCK RATE ASSEMBLY- RESOLUTION ONE SEVENTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLANCA RUBIO BELT TO SCHOOL BREAKFAST WEEK IS RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. AND MEMBERS COLLEAGUES I RISE TO RE YOUR SUPPORT ON ACR ONE SEVENTY EIGHT TO DECLARE SO THROUGH THE SIX SCHOOL BREAKFAST WEEK CAL. AS A FORMER TEACHER I SAW MANY STUDENTS COME TO THE SCHOOL ON AN EMPTY STOMACH EMPTY STOMACH. WHICH THEN AFFECTED THEIR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE THIS RESOLUTION HIGHLIGHTS HOW SCHOOL BREAKFAST IS A VALUABLE TOOL IN FIGHTING CHILD HUNGER AND SUPPORTING THE ACADEMIC SUCCESS A BIT OF A VULNERABLE CALIFORNIA POPULATION. SCHOOL BREAKFAST IS AN INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE AND OUR CHILDREN. WHEN STUDENTS START THEIR DAY WITH A HEALTHY BREAKFAST PRINCIPALS AND TEACHERS REPORT THAT THEY ATTEND AN AVERAGE OF ONE POINT FIVE MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL PER YEAR. SCORE HIGHER ON TESTS AND ARE 20% MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL. IN FACT A RECENT REPORT SHOWED THAT OFFERING BREAKFAST AS PART OF THE SCHOOL DAY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM. A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER I WANT TO COMMEND ALL THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN MY REGION THAT HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN THIS CRITICAL PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES MEALS FOR OUR CHILDREN. THE ADMINISTRATORS AND STRUCTURES OF THAT SAN GABRIEL VALLEY ARE LEADING BY EXAMPLE IN THEIR EFFORTS TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH EVERY CHANCE TO SUCCEED. I HOPE THAT WITH THIS RESOLUTION WE CONTINUE TO RAISE AWARENESS OF SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAMS AND TAKE GREATER ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY THEY OFFERED TO HELP OUR CHILDREN THRIVE. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON ACR ONE SEVENTY EIGHT. THANK YOU MS RUBIO MR BLOOM WE ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF ACR ONE SEVENTY EIGHT I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM BALDWIN PARK FOR BRINGING THE RESOLUTION FORWARD. SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAMS ARE CRITICAL ARE CRITICAL FOR CHILDREN'S NUTRITION. FIFTY YEARS AGO OBESITY WAS A RELATIVELY RARE CONDITION BUT TODAY ONE THIRD OF CHILDREN AGED TEN TO SEVENTEEN ARE OBESE AND IF NOTHING CHANGES. HALF OF AMERICA HALF OF AMERICA WILL BE OBESE WITHIN APPROXIMATELY TEN YEARS. AND WITH THOSE NUMBERS COME INCREASES IN DIABETES HEART DISEASE FATTY LIVER DISEASE AND MANY OTHER CONSEQUENCES. AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS STATISTICS ARE EVEN HIGHER. ASIDE FROM THE NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS FISCAL COSTS ARE EXTREME. IF ADULT BODY MASS INDEX FELL BY ONLY 5% CALIFORNIA COULD SAVE EIGHTY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN OBESITY RELATED HEALTH COSTS BY TWENTY THIRTY. FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES WE NEED TO ENACT POLICIES THAT DRIVE CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR AND NUTRITION PROGRAMS LIKE SCHOOL BREAKFAST AFTER A LIKE AFTER SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAMS LIKE AFTER THE BELL. CAN HELP REDUCE CONSUMPTION OF SUGARY BEVERAGES AND INCREASED CONSUMPTION OF HEALTHY WHOLE GRAIN PRODUCTS FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT ALL HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE THE OBESITY RATE IN CHILDREN. THESE ARE THE KIND OF EFFORTS THAT FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA HAS CHAMPIONED BUT UNFORTUNATELY HER PROGRAMS ARE BEING ROLLED BACK BY THE BY OUR CURRENT AGRICULTURE CELL. AGRICULTURE SECRETARY SONNY PERDUE AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. RESOLUTIONS LIKE ACR ONE SEVENTY EIGHT CHAMPIONING THE IMPORTANCE OF SCHOOL BREAKFASTS HELP US TO UNDERSTAND AND FURTHER POLICIES THAT WILL REDUCE THE EPIDEMIC OF OBESITY THAT IS PLAGUING OUR COUNTRY. AND THAT IS WHY I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. SURE KANSEN CHU YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. CHECK YOUR MISTER SPEAKER SANG COLLEAGUES ARE RISING STRONG SUPPORTER OF ACR ONE SEVENTY EIGHT AND WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM BALDWIN PARK FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FOR US OF ALMOST GLOBAL MEMBERS I HAVE EXPERIENCE IT FIRSTHAND THAT TOO MANY KIDS BECAUSE THEY COME TO SCHOOL HUNGRY WITHOUT EATING BREAKFAST WE KNOW THIS IN FACT THEIR ABILITY TO LEARN. TO BE ATTENTIVE IN THE CLASS AND ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND OVER ALL HELL'S WE KNOW THAT NOT EVEN HALF OF TO STUDENTS WHO ARE ILLEGIBLE FOR FREE OR REDUCED PRICE SCHOOL MALES PARTICIPATE IN THE SCHOOL BREAKFAST WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE CAN IN OUR POWER TO INCREASE THE PARTICIPATION IN THOSE PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT NO CHILDREN TO SIT IN THE CLASSROOM. HUNGRY LOOK LOOKING AT THE LARGER PICTURE OF THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WE MUST INCLUDE THIS IN OUR COME CONVERSATION.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR YOUR ADJOURNMENTS IN MEMORY. COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY TO ADJOURN IN MEMORY OF A GOOD FRIEND. AND A GREAT PART OF THIS INSTITUTION. DOUGLAS DOUG HOLLAND. DOUG WAS A PUBLIC SERVANT HERE SIR WITH US FOR TWENTY YEARS TWENTY SEVEN YEARS HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY. HE AND I HAD A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WHERE ACTIONS SAY GOOD FRIENDS. THOUGH IN HIS DEVOTION TO PUBLIC SERVICE HE AND I WERE OPPONENTS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IN A DECEMBER DISTRICT FOR A FINE MAN WAS DUG TALENT. AND SORTS WITH GREAT REGRET THAT I RECOUNT THAT ON JANUARY TWENTY THIRD OF THIS YEAR. MY FRIEND DOUG GALLON THIS PARTNER IN OUR LAW MAKING HERE IS TAKE APPLE FOR MORE THAN A QUARTER CENTURY. PASSED AWAY AFTER A BRIEF BUT DIGNIFIED BATTLE WITH RENAL CELL CARCINOMA. DOUG WAS BORN MAY THIRD NINETEEN FIFTY TWO SO HE WAS ON THE SCENE A LITTLE BIT EARLIER THAN ME NOT MUCH IN DETROIT MICHIGAN. GREW UP LIVING ON HIS FAMILY FARM IN HENNING MINNESOTA. AND I AM HAVING ACTUALLY EVER DISCLOSES TO ANYONE CERTAINLY NOT HERE'S FROM NOT THE FAMILY. BUT HITTING. ISM IS A FAMILY NAME IN MY FAMILY. MY GRANDFATHER WAS FROM A WISCONSIN NEXT DOOR TO MINNESOTA. AND SO INTERESTING TO ME THAT MY FRIEND DOG ACTUALLY GREW UP IN HìNH IN MINNESOTA. HE WAS PART OF THAT HIGH SCHOOL WAS A MEMBER THE MINNESOTA ALL STATE CHOIR CHOIR HAD A TREMENDOUS VOICE DID A LOT OF RADIO FOR HIS CAUCUS MEMBERS- GREAT TENER. AND AFTER YOU GRADUATE FROM HIM IN HIGH SCHOOL AND I PLAN TO RETURN THIS IN A MINUTE. HE ACTUALLY ENTER THE UNITED STATES ARMED SERVICES UNITED STATES AIRFORCE. HE SERVED IN UPPER PENINSULA MICHIGAN HE WAS A RADAR OPERATOR PART OF THE NORAD SYSTEM. SO HE WAS A PART OF THE ROLE IN THE AIR FORCE ARE REALLY LOOKING FOR TROUBLE FROM AFAR OFF. AND TAKE A PREEMPTIVE STEPS. WHICH A AS I LOOK AT MY COLLEAGUES ON THE FOR THAT KIND OF HAS THE PERILS TO THE PUBLIC SERVICE HERE IN THE CAPITAL ACTUALLY. AFTER DISCHARGE HE WENT ON TO SERVE- IN MICHIGAN PARTNER CORRECTIONS WALL GOING TO NORTHERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY. HE EVENTUALLY CAME TO CALIFORNIA IN HIS MID TWENTIES HE ESTABLISHED A PRIVATE SECTOR FIRM. SECURITY FIRM SERVICES FOR BAY AREA- AND THEN HEARING. OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC SERVICE THE LEGISLATURE THAT'S WHAT HE BEGAN TO DO. AND HE BECAME AN EXPERT IN THE FIELD OF AGRICULTURE WATER POLICY NATURAL RESOURCES AND HEARING HIS TIME IN THE ASSEMBLY AND A LITTLE BIT IN THE SENATE HE WORE MANY HATS. AND THAT IS SORT THE WAY OUR CAREERS GO. FIRST TIMES DOG WAS ALLEGE SAVE EIGHT A FIELD REPRESENTATIVE A LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR. A COMMITTEE CONSULT. CHIEF OF STAFF ASSEMBLY MEMBER PHIL WYMAN. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHIRLEY HORTON AND THEN THE DIRECTOR OF MEMBER SERVICES FOR THE ENTIRE SOME REPUBLICAN CAUCUS. SHE JUST SEE A SEASONED INDIVIDUAL WHO WENT TO THE INSTITUTION LEARNED A LOT OF JOBS AND KEPT GIVING. ARM HE HAD A CHANCE TO SHAPE PUBLIC POLICY IN A VERY PERSONAL WAY. WHEN HE AND HIS FAMILY LOST A GRANDSON DUSTIN. TO CHILD ABUSE IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. AND HE HAD A HAND IN RALLY IN SUPPORT FOR LAW DUSTIN'S LAW. WHICH WOULD PROTECT CHILDREN INSURER THAT FAMILIES WERE FORMED IF A ABUSER RETURN FROM PRISON. AND THE THAT LAW DUSTIN LAW WHICH DESIGNED TO DEAL WITH THAT FACT PATTERN IT'S SO HE WAS ABLE TO KIND OF TAKE SOME OF THE PAIN IN HIS FAMILY AND CONVERTED TO A POSITIVE GOOD. DOUG WAS PROMINENT FIGURE IN THE COMMUNITY ROSEMONT- HE WAS A PESIDENT ROSE ROCKNE SO SHE'S FRACTURED NUMBER YEARS ALSO ACT WITH THE ROSE ONE ROTARY CLUB OR THE CARMICHAEL ROTARY CLUB. AND THIS IS SORT OF WHERE I BRING BACK IN THAT MILITARY SERVICE AS I LOOK AT FAMILY. ARE YEAH HE WAS OF HONORED VERY NICE STATES AIRFORCE. THE NEXT YEAR TICKET IS A FORMAL VALUE WHEN HE WAS THERE IN THE SEVENTIES BUT BY THE NINETIES IN THE U. S. AIR FORCE THEY HAD UNDERSTOOD ARTICULATE THAT ONE OF THEIR COMMON VALUES. WAS SERVICE BEFORE SELF. AND OF COURSE IS A MEMBER OF ROTARY. WHY WOULD DODD BE AT HOME IN THE CAR MICHAEL ROTARY CLUB. WELL BECAUSE THE CARMICHAEL ROTARY CLUB HAD THE SAME SORT OF VALUE SERVICE ABOVE SELF. SO IT'S INTERESTING TO ME THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOMEONE'S CAREER ACROSS A SPAN OF THEIR LIVES YOU CAN LOOK AT DOG US AIRFORCE. SERVING HIS NATION A KIND OF THIS EARLY MORNING PICKET LOOK INTO PROBLEMS THAT MIGHT BE ADDRESSED. FOUND HIS WAY INTO PUBLIC SERVICE THE CAPITAL STILL IN GATES AND I WOULD SAY SERVICE BEFORE SELF. SERVICE ABOVE SELF FOUND A HOME IN THE IN THE CARMICHAEL ROTARY CLUB LIVING OUT THOSE SAME VALUES. SO I JUST SORT OF SEE A LONG PERSISTENCE TO THE SAME DIRECTION ACROSS THE LIFE OF DOUG CALLAN NOT BROUGHT HIM TO THIS INSTITUTION TO OUR HOUSE WHERE SIR FOR SO LONG. A DOG IS SURVIVED BY HIS BELOVED WIFE JANE WHO'S WITH US THIS MORNING HIS SON'S TROIAN LORDS HIS STEP CHILDREN ACTUALLY ABERCROMBIE EMPLOYEES WHO DAHLE AND DAVID STRASBOURG- HIS MOTHER EVERLY BOSS AND JOIN US HERE. HIS SISTER CAROLINE SOLOMON AND MANY GRANDCHILDREN. DOUG CERTAIN AN INDELIBLE MARK ON THIS INSTITUTION. AND ON ALL WHO KNEW HIM. AND I RESPECT REQUEST WE ADJOURN IN A MEMBER ABOUT HELEN TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER COOLEY AND MISTER GALLAGHER YOU TWO ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE STREET GERMAIN MEMORY. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AND THAT IT IS MY HONOR. THIS MORNING SORRY THIS AFTERNOON TO ADJOURN IN MEMORY OF. DOUGLAS HOLLAND ON ON BEHALF OF THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS. I'M IN AS MANY OF YOU KNOW DOUG WAS A VITAL PART. OF OUR POLICY CAUCUS FOR MANY YEARS. YOU KNOW. IT IS SAID THAT THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN ASSEMBLY- ONE OF OUR GRASSROOTS GROUPS IS THE CONSCIENCE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I THINK THAT WE COULD SAY VERY. VERY CLEARLY TODAY THAT DOUG HOLLAND. WAS THE CONSCIENCE OF THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN ASSEMBLY CAUCUS. THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT THINGS IT COULD BE SAID ABOUT DOUG. AND MANY OF THE MEN REV REFERENCED. BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM RANCHO CORDOVA BUT FARM BOY. VETERAN TRUSTED ADVISER AND THAT I THINK IS A BIG ONE TRUSTED ADVISER FRIEND. GREAT FRIEND GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR. SOMEONE WHO ALWAYS HAD.KNOWLEDGE TO BRING TO THE TABLE BUT HE COULD DO IT IN A WAY THAT WOULD MAKE YOU LAUGH. GRANDFATHER BELOVED GRANDFATHER AND UNCLE. MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WERE PART OF WHO DUG WAS. BUT I THINK THAT. WHAT WAS GREAT ABOUT DOUG IS THAT HE CAME TO CALIFORNIA. IN HIS TWENTIES AND STARTED OUT YOU AS A AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER ACTUALLY RUNNING A SECURITY SERVICE. BUT HE DECIDED. THAT HIS REAL PASSION WAS FOR PUBLIC SERVICE. AND SO YOU KNOW IN IN THOSE MID TWENTIES HE MADE THE CAREER DECISION. TO BECOME PART OF THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS HERE TO COME AND WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE ON BEHALF OF THE ISSUES THAT HE CARED ABOUT SO MUCH THEN HE SPENT THE NEXT TWENTY SEVEN YEARS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE DOING JUST THAT. AND MAKING SO MANY DIFFERENT GAINES. I LOOK BACK. AND THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT HE IMPACTED POLICY FROM FORESTRY ISSUES TO WATER ISSUES HE WAS A KEY PLAYER IN THE WATER BOND DISCUSSIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE TO. DUSTIN'S LAW YOU KNOW WHICH WAS NAMED AFTER HIS GRANDSON WHO WAS MURDERED. AND DOUG TOOK THAT PAINFUL EXPERIENCE AND TURNED IT INTO PUBLIC POLICY. THAT HELPS KEEP CHILDREN SAFE AND THE STATE. THE OTHER THING I THINK ABOUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT CALLING HIS MENTOR. AND DOUG ALWAYS HAD TIME. FOR OTHER PEOPLE I ALWAYS HAD TIME TO GIVE OF HIS KNOWLEDGE TO. YOUNGER GENERATIONS- TO OTHER PEOPLE THAT WERE WORKING WITH HIM IN THE POLICY CAUCUS AND IF YOU IF YOU TALK AROUND. THE STAFF OF OUR CAUCUS SO MANY PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY WERE MENTORED IN SOME WAY. BY DOUG COLLINS. NOW I THINK ABOUT MY OWN LIFE- IT'S REALLY KIND OF FUNNY HOW DOUG POPPED UP IN MY LIFE. I FEEL LIKE IN IN CRITICAL JUNCTURES I REMEMBER AS A- AS A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT AS THE FUTURE FARMERS OF AMERICA MEMBER YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN THESE- YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN COMING INTO OUR CAPITAL WITH THE BLUE JACKETS I WAS ONE OF THOSE AND I REMEMBER VISITING THE CAPITAL AND WE GOT TO SIT DOWN WITH DOUG COLLINS. LEE WHEN HE WAS THE CHIEF OF STAFF AND I STILL THINK BACK TO A STORY THAT HE TOLD WHERE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. IT WAS KIND OF MY FIRST LESSON IN MESSAGING. WHERE DOUG SAID YOU KNOW. A LOT OF TIMES AGRICULTURAL GROUPS COE IN AND THEY TALK ABOUT THEIR PRODUCTS AND THEY TALK ABOUT. OTHER CROPS AND THAT'S GOOD BUT YOU NEED TO FIND A WAY TO BRING IT HOME. TO EVERYDAY FOLKS INTO THE BROADER PUBLIC AND SO HE USES AN EXAMPLE- FOR EXAMPLE IN THE MILK PRICES AND MILK. POLICY GOES IT'S NOT JUST HOW IT AFFECTS THE DAIRY FARM BUT TALK ABOUT HOW IT AFFECTS- MOMS YOU KNOW YOU ARE BUYING MILK FOR THEIR CHILDREN- AND MAKE IT A BROADER. HELP MAKE IT MORE APPLIED TO A BROADER STATEMENT HE WAS RIGHT. BECAUSE SO MUCH OF WHAT WE DO AND FOOD POLICY IT DOESN'T JUST AFFECT FARMERS THAT AFFECTS ALL OF US. BECAUSE WE ALL NEED FOOD D. N. I REMEMBER A LITTLE BIT LATER IN TIME WHEN I WAS A AN ASSEMBLY FELLOW. AND SERVED IN THE ASSEMBLY FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM IN THIS BODY. AND DOUG POPPED UP ONCE AGAIN YOU KNOW AS AS A KEY CONSULTANT- ON NATURAL RESOURCES. AND MY MENTOR AT THE TIME WAS CINDY HILLARY WHO NOW RUNS OUR BUDGET- POLICY- AND DOUG WAS THE KEY CONSULTANT WORKING ON FORESTRY IN A- HELLO REALLY ALLOW MARK FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION- LEGISLATION FIRST OF ITS KIND THAT ALLOWED US TO. TO THIN MORE TREES AND HAVE BETTER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN THE FORCE DOUG- WAS KEY TO THAT NIGHT AND I AND I CAN RECALL DOUG BEING IN THE OFFICE. SO MANY DIFFERENT TIMES WITH THE HUMOR WITH THAT WITH. BUT ALWAYS YOU KNOW. IT WAS SAID IN A BIO ABOUT HIM THAT DOUG ALWAYS STROVE TO EDUCATE IN A RESPECTFUL AND POSITIVE WAY AND I THINK THAT'S SO TRUE. IN A CONVERSATION WITH DOUG MOST OFTEN LEFT ONE MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE. THAN BEFORE IT BEGAN. BUT IN THAT PROCESS I TELL YOU WHAT HE WOULD BE YOU WOULD BE LAUGHING- BECAUSE HE HAD JUST AN AMAZING SENSE OF HUMOR AND A WAY TO CONNECT- AND THAT WAS PART OF HIS MENTOR SHIP I THINK HE BROUGHT PEOPLE IN. HE ATTRACT THE ATTRACTED PEOPLE TO HIMSELF BUT HE ALWAYS PASSED ON. A KNOWLEDGE AND THAT WAS SUCH A KEY PART. A FEW DOUG WAS. HE WAS DEVOTED TO HIS MOTHER. WHO WAS A BIG- FIGURE IN HIS LIFE ANY ALWAYS AFFECTIONATELY REFERRED TO EACH OF HIS SONS EVEN AFTER THEY WERE GROWN MEN. AS SWEETHEART. DOUG WAS A PRINCIPLED MAN WHO BELIEVE THERE IS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN PROTECTING. THE ONES THAT YOU LOVE. AND I GOT TO SEE. THAT AND DUG ANOTHER MOMENT THE TO I DON'T EVEN MAYBE NO HE KNOWS ABOUT AYE AYE ATTENDED TO. A CHURCH SERVICE ONE TIME WERE ACTUALLY GOT TO HEAR DOUG GIVE HIS TESTIMONY- TO THE CHURCH. AND THE. YOUR CRIES CHANGE DOES LIFE AND I GOT TO HEAR A VERY PERSONAL- TESTIMONY FROM HIM- THAT DAY AND IT WAS ALWAYS ANOTHER THING THAT JUST STUCK WITH ME ABOUT DUG IN AS WE- NOW. WHEN I BECAME AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH HIM. IN THAT ROLE I CONTINUE TO RELY ON HIS GOOD ADVICE AND ALL OF US DO. AND HAVE. IN THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS. THE OTHER THING ABOUT DOUG IS THAT HE MET HIS TRUE LOVE AND PARTNER IN JANE. WHO WAS A HUGE PART OF HIS LOVE WHO IS A HUGE PART OF HIS LIFE. AND I KNOW THAT SHE IN THE FAMILY ARE HERE WITH US TODAY IT WAS A BLESSED IN LOVING UNION. ONE THAT BROUGHT DOUG'S. CLOSEST TO HIS FAMILY AND DUG IN JANE. ENJOYED SO MANY SO MUCH TIME TOGETHER. THAT WAS OF HIS FAMILY WAS SO IMPORTANT TO HIM AND JOIN TRAVELING TRIPS TO THE COAST VISITING THE GRAND CHILDREN DATE NIGHTS BINGE WATCHING NETFLIX. HOLDING HANDS AND JUST BEING TOGETHER DOUG WAS A HAPPY MAN BECAUSE A JANE. AND HIS FAMILY. AND SO AS I AS I THINK BACK ABOUT DOUG COLLINS JUST ALL THE THINGS THAT HE WAS TO SO MANY PEOPLE THE LIVES HE TOUCHED THE MENTOR THAT HE WAS. IT'S A BIG PART OF WHAT THIS INSTITUTION IS ALL ABOUT IS ABOUT REALLY NUMBER ONE CARING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS OF PEOPLE CARING ABOUT POLICY. AND HOW IT AFFECTS CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE STATE BUT IT'S ABOUT GIVING BACK ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE BUT GIVING IT BACK TRANSMITTING KNOWLEDGE. TO THE NEXT GENERATION. AND DOUG HOLLAND DID THAT SO VERY WELL. DOUG IS SURVIVED BY HIS WIFE JANE. AND HIS SONS TROY DOUG JUNIOR. LAWRENCE AND. ALSO HIS MOTHER EVELYN BASSIN. AND COUNTLESS GRAND CHILDREN. NEPHEWS AND NIECES TO WHOM HE WAS SUCH A BELOVED FIGURE. MEMBERS I JUST ASK THAT WE REMEMBER THIS THIS GREAT LEGACY THAT WE HAD AND SOMEONE WHO DEVOTED SO MUCH TIME TO THIS PLACE AND GOOD PUBLIC POLICY ASKED THAT WE CLOSE IN MEMORY. OF DOUG COLLINS.
