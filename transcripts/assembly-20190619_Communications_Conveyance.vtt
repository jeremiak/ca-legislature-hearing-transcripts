IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY

00:45:26.924 --> 00:45:28.992
AND NORMALLY THIS MONEY COMES

00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:30.694
FROM THE MOST VULNERABLE.

00:45:30.761 --> 00:45:32.362
IN OUR COMMUNITY USUALLY IT'S

00:45:32.429 --> 00:45:33.664
THE ELDERLY.

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.332
USUALLY IT'S DISABLED THESE

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:37.201
PEOPLE ARE TARGETED BY THIS THE

00:45:37.267 --> 00:45:39.236
MASS GENERATION OF THESE CALLS.

00:45:39.303 --> 00:45:41.772
THIS BILL [inaudible]

00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:45.642
WOULD REQUIRE THAT A CALLER ID

00:45:45.709 --> 00:45:47.878
SYSTEM BE PUT IN PLACE BY THE

00:45:47.945 --> 00:45:49.179

00:45:49.246 --> 00:45:51.115
TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES THIS

00:45:51.181 --> 00:45:53.750
BILL SETS A JULY FIRST TWENTY

00:45:53.817 --> 00:45:54.384
TWENTY DEADLINES FOR THAT TO BE

00:45:54.451 --> 00:45:57.454
DONE -- THIS WOULD REQUIRE THAT

00:45:57.521 --> 00:46:00.557
OUR CALLER AUTHENTICATION --

00:46:00.624 --> 00:46:03.627
PROGRAM BE -- INSTALLED.

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:06.563
INTO EVERYBODY'S ACCOUNT SO THAT --

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:08.098
THESE CALLS ARE PREVENTED.

00:46:08.165 --> 00:46:10.734
AND LARGELY I JUST WANTED TO

00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:12.703
MAKE IT VERY VERY CLEAR.

00:46:12.769 --> 00:46:15.272
THIS -- TARGETS SPOOFING.

00:46:15.339 --> 00:46:18.075
IT DOES NOT EXPAND THE CPU SEES

00:46:18.142 --> 00:46:19.476
AUTHORITY.

00:46:19.543 --> 00:46:21.311
IT NARROWLY ALLOWS THE CPUC TO

00:46:21.378 --> 00:46:23.046
WORK WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

00:46:23.113 --> 00:46:24.948

00:46:28.519 --> 00:46:31.321
SHAPE IN THE FIFTH AND AND IN

00:46:31.388 --> 00:46:32.422
THE WAY OF IDENTIFYING.

GATHERING INFORMATION.

00:46:37.828 --> 00:46:39.363
BAND THAT COULD GO A LONG WAY TO

00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:40.797
HELPING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO

00:46:40.864 --> 00:46:41.965
ENFORCE THIS.

00:46:42.032 --> 00:46:43.133
IT ALSO DOES NOT REQUIRE CALL

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.635
BLOCKING.

00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:46.270

00:46:48.939 --> 00:46:50.274
DO.

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:52.910
AND IT ALSO WOULD NOT RESULT IN

00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:54.912
REAL CALLS BEING BLOCKED BECAUSE

00:46:54.978 --> 00:46:57.915
THIS -- THIS IDENTIFIER SYSTEM

00:46:57.981 --> 00:46:59.716
WHERE THIS TECHNOLOGY SIMPLY

00:46:59.783 --> 00:47:01.785
LOOKS FOR COMPUTER GENERATED

00:47:01.852 --> 00:47:02.953
CALLS.

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:05.455
DOES THE THE THAT -- ONLY THOSE

00:47:05.522 --> 00:47:08.091
THAT DO NOT IMPLEMENT CALLER ID.

00:47:08.158 --> 00:47:09.693
AUTHENTICATION SYSTEMS AND

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.396
USUALLY THOSE WOULD BE -- THE

00:47:12.462 --> 00:47:14.264
THE ROBO CALLS.

00:47:14.331 --> 00:47:16.266
THOSE THAT DO NOT -- COMPLETE

00:47:16.333 --> 00:47:18.702
THAT WOULD BE A COMMITTEE LED A

00:47:18.769 --> 00:47:20.671
VIOLATION OF THE LAW UNDER THIS

00:47:20.737 --> 00:47:21.772

THEIR TELEPHONE.

00:47:27.945 --> 00:47:29.413
IT WOULD ALSO ELIMINATE.

00:47:29.479 --> 00:47:31.715
FAKE CALLS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:47:31.782 --> 00:47:34.585

00:49:01.905 --> 00:49:02.572
YOU KNOW THIS TO BE KIND OF

00:49:02.639 --> 00:49:03.173
THINGS UNDERMINE TRUST IN THE

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.107
PHONE SYSTEM BUT ALSO OUR

00:49:04.174 --> 00:49:04.441
INSTITUTIONS.

00:49:04.508 --> 00:49:05.075
SO WE MUST QUICKLY TAKE ACTION

00:49:05.142 --> 00:49:06.243
TO STOP THIS AND FOR THOSE

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:06.777
REASONS -- WE ASK FOR YOUR

00:49:06.843 --> 00:49:10.013

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:17.888
IN SUPPORT THE BILL AND I THINK

THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING LEADERSHIP

00:49:19.423 --> 00:49:20.590
ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE.

00:49:20.657 --> 00:49:21.725
OTHERS BEEN A LOT OF WORK ON

00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:23.760
THIS ISSUE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS

00:49:23.827 --> 00:49:24.628
BUT FEDERAL LEVEL AND STATE

00:49:24.695 --> 00:49:25.195
LEVEL.

00:49:25.262 --> 00:49:26.463
AND REALLY WE'VE ARRIVED AT A

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:27.664
POINT WHERE THERE IS TECHNOLOGY

00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:30.500
THAT IS AVAILABLE -- AND WITH

00:49:30.567 --> 00:49:31.768
THIS BILL REALLY.

00:49:31.835 --> 00:49:32.703
NO DOZEN WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

00:49:32.769 --> 00:49:33.870
DOLLARS JUST SET THE TIME

00:49:33.937 --> 00:49:35.906
CERTAIN -- THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY

00:49:35.972 --> 00:49:38.041
WILL BE USED TO HELP ADDRESS

00:49:38.108 --> 00:49:39.976
THIS ISSUE -- AS BOTH THE AUTHOR

00:49:40.043 --> 00:49:42.713
THE WITNESS STATED -- THIS

00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:44.381
PROBLEM IS GROWING IT'S GROWING

00:49:44.448 --> 00:49:45.816
EXPONENTIALLY AND IT'S NOT JUST

00:49:45.882 --> 00:49:47.317
GROWN AND AS FAR AS NUMBER AND

00:49:47.384 --> 00:49:48.652
VOLUME BUT IT'S GROWN IN THE

00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:50.921
TYPE OF SCAMS THAT ARE OCCURRING.

00:49:50.987 --> 00:49:52.255
I HEARD SOME OF THE EXAMPLES BUT

00:49:52.322 --> 00:49:53.890
WE'VE ALSO HAD FOR EXAMPLE SAN

00:49:53.957 --> 00:49:55.992
DIEGO -- WHERE THE NUMBER CAME

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:57.694
UP WAS IF IT WAS LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:58.595
AND THEN THE?

00:49:58.662 --> 00:49:59.629
AND THEY'RE SAYING THAT THERE

00:49:59.696 --> 00:50:01.531
WAS A WARRANT THAT WAS A THAT

00:50:01.598 --> 00:50:04.000
WAS OUT AND IF YOU DIDN'T PAY --

00:50:04.067 --> 00:50:05.435
FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS FIVE

00:50:05.502 --> 00:50:06.036
DOLLARS ON THE SPOT OVER THE

00:50:06.103 --> 00:50:07.938
PHONE -- THAT THERE WOULD BE AN

00:50:08.004 --> 00:50:09.239
ARREST THAT WOULD BE OCCURRING

00:50:09.306 --> 00:50:10.941
SO THINGS LIKE THAT ARE GOING ON

00:50:11.007 --> 00:50:12.209
OVER AND OVER AS THE AUTHOR

00:50:12.275 --> 00:50:13.710

WE LIKE TO SEE IS THAT -- IN THE

WE WERE TO BLOCK A CALL THAT WAS

00:53:50.527 --> 00:53:53.964
A CRITICAL EMERGENCY ALERT --

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:55.532
AND BEST INTENTION IS NOT TO DO

THAT AND NOT TO BLOCK IT BUT

00:53:57.334 --> 00:53:58.635
AGAIN THIS IS BRAND NEW PRO --

00:53:58.702 --> 00:53:59.903
BRANDS SOFTWARE THAT WE'RE

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:01.404

00:54:03.073 --> 00:54:04.107
HOPE THAT WERE BETA TESTING IT

00:54:04.174 --> 00:54:05.575
RIGHT NOW I BELIEVE EIGHTEEN

00:54:05.642 --> 00:54:06.576
TEASE BETA TESTING.

00:54:06.643 --> 00:54:07.944
COMCAST IS BETA TESTING THAT SO

00:54:08.011 --> 00:54:10.447
IT'S NOT COMPLETE SO WE HAVE

00:54:10.513 --> 00:54:11.848

00:54:18.221 --> 00:54:19.656
WE WE JUST HOPE THAT WE DO COULD

00:54:19.723 --> 00:54:21.191
GET TO COMPLETE THAT SO WITH

00:54:21.257 --> 00:54:21.691
SOME SORT OF LIABILITY

00:54:21.758 --> 00:54:22.959
PROTECTION THAT WOULD BE

00:54:23.026 --> 00:54:24.561
CRITICAL FOR US.

00:54:24.628 --> 00:54:28.999

ACTORS INTO FEDERAL COURT IT'S

00:55:04.567 --> 00:55:05.869

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:47.844
OUR TWENTY GENERAL ENGAGED IN

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:51.314
THIS TO THE DEGREE THAT THEY ARE.

01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:52.315
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE ENGAGED

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:53.750
ISN'T.

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:56.019
THE IT'S PART OF THE SOLUTION

01:00:56.085 --> 01:00:57.820
THEY HAVEN'T COME TO A SOLUTION

01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:15.405
SOLUTION -- THE P. YOU SEE IS

01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:16.839
