00:34:57.094 --> 00:34:58.996
THIS ISSUE.

00:34:59.063 --> 00:35:00.665
IT MEANS PLANNING COMMUNITIES

00:35:00.731 --> 00:35:01.432
THAT ARE HARDENED AGAINST

00:35:01.499 --> 00:35:03.067
WILDFIRES WITH FEW BREAKS IN AND

00:35:03.134 --> 00:35:04.669
AROUND THE COMMUNITIES.

00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:11.409
PROTECTION RESOURCES.

00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:12.944
IT INCLUDES BUILDING HOMES OUT

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:14.545
OF AMBER RESISTANT MATERIALS

00:35:14.612 --> 00:35:16.614
WHILE MAINTAINING THE ONE

00:35:16.681 --> 00:35:18.082
HUNDRED FOOT DEFENSIBLE SPACE BY

00:35:21.486 --> 00:35:23.721
IN CALIFORNIA ARGUABLY HAS SOME

00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:24.355
OF THE MOST STRINGENT WELL IN

00:35:24.422 --> 00:35:25.823

RESISTANT.

00:35:36.834 --> 00:35:38.236
OF COURSE THE ONE MILLION DOLLAR

00:35:38.302 --> 00:35:39.971
QUESTION IS WHAT ABOUT ALL THE

00:35:40.037 --> 00:35:42.373
HOMES THAT WERE BUILT BEFORE TWO

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.674

00:36:00.658 --> 00:36:03.427
BOTH PUBLIC EVACUATIONS AND

CAUSED BY THE ACTIVITY OF PEOPLE.

00:39:13.951 --> 00:39:15.319

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:08.452
EVERY THREE YEARS.

00:48:08.518 --> 00:48:09.519
BUT IT SEEMS FROM THE DATE OF

00:48:09.586 --> 00:48:11.021
THE CALL FIRE IS INSPECTING

00:48:11.088 --> 00:48:11.922
ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE

00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:13.490
STRUCTURES EACH YEAR AND I'M

00:48:13.557 --> 00:48:14.825
WONDERING WHAT IT WOULD TAKE FOR

00:48:14.891 --> 00:48:17.227
CAL FIRE TO BE ABLE TO MEET ITS

00:48:17.294 --> 00:48:19.863
GOAL.

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:21.098
WELL IT'S A GOOD QUESTION --

00:48:21.164 --> 00:48:22.499
THIS PAST YEAR WE WE HIT THE THE

00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:23.767
HIGHEST NUMBER WE'VE EVER MET

00:48:23.834 --> 00:48:26.069
THE GOAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND

00:48:26.136 --> 00:48:26.737
FIFTY THOUSAND PER YEAR.

00:48:26.803 --> 00:48:29.940
IS ROUGHLY A STAB ABLE TO

00:48:30.007 --> 00:48:32.376
INSPECT EVERY DAY HOME EVERY

00:48:32.442 --> 00:48:33.410
THREE YEARS.

00:48:33.477 --> 00:48:35.746
AND SO --

00:48:35.812 --> 00:48:36.313
YOU KNOW WE'VE --

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:37.648
THE ANSWER ANY IS IS ONE OF THE

00:48:37.714 --> 00:48:39.449
FASTEST GROWING AREAS IN THE

00:48:39.516 --> 00:48:40.517
STATE.

00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:43.954
AND SO WE WE ARE CONTINUING --

00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:45.555
TO TO MAKE STRIDES IN THAT.

00:48:45.622 --> 00:48:47.324
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE IF THE

00:48:47.391 --> 00:48:49.559
DATA ARE INSPECTIONS HAVE GROWN

00:48:49.626 --> 00:48:50.661
EVERY YEAR THE NUMBER OF

00:48:50.727 --> 00:48:52.062
INSPECTIONS HAS RISEN.

00:48:52.129 --> 00:48:56.033
EVERY YEAR BUT ARE ARE --

00:48:56.099 --> 00:48:58.402
THE WHOLE PROCESS IS REALLY BEEN

00:48:58.468 --> 00:49:00.103
UNDER IS UNDER ANALYSIS.

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:01.705
WERE USING SEASONAL WORK RIGHT

00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:04.541
NOW SEASONAL OF FOUR STREETS TO

00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:05.976
TO DO THAT DEFENSIBLE SPACE

00:49:06.043 --> 00:49:07.477
INSPECTION IN CONJUNCTION WITH

00:49:07.544 --> 00:49:08.779
OUR ENGINE COMPANIES WHO WE

00:49:08.845 --> 00:49:11.515
RELIED ON GREATLY TO GO OUT AND

00:49:11.581 --> 00:49:13.150

IN THE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.

00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:17.487
AND SO WE'RE WE'RE CONDUCTING A

00:49:17.554 --> 00:49:19.489
WORKLOAD ANALYSIS OF WHAT OF

00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:21.191
WHAT IS THE WORKLOAD THE TRUE

00:49:21.258 --> 00:49:24.561
WORKLOAD AND AND AND AND THE WAY

00:49:24.628 --> 00:49:25.028
THAT WE CAN STAFF THAT

00:49:25.095 --> 00:49:26.396
APPROPRIATELY.

00:49:39.543 --> 00:49:43.213
GOING GETTING THOSE ESTABLISHED --

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.649
WILL FUEL BREAKS.

00:49:45.716 --> 00:49:46.650
THE SPAN JURISDICTIONAL

00:49:46.717 --> 00:49:48.251
BOUNDARIES.

00:49:48.318 --> 00:49:49.586

00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:16.072
IT'S ULTIMATELY THE HOMEOWNERS

00:51:16.139 --> 00:51:17.607
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE THE

00:51:17.674 --> 00:51:19.009
CLEARANCE.

00:51:19.075 --> 00:51:21.044
AND YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE SOME

00:51:21.111 --> 00:51:23.113
INSURANCE INCENTIVES FOR THE

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:24.681
LANDOWNER THE HOMEOWNR --

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:26.116
THERE MAY BE SOME GRANTS THROUGH

00:51:26.183 --> 00:51:27.617
SOME NON PROFITS THAT MIGHT BE

00:51:27.684 --> 00:51:30.654
AVAILABLE BUT THERE THAT'S

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.656
ULTIMATELY ABOUT ALL WE CAN WE

YOU VERY MUCH FOR FOR BLOOM --

00:51:38.495 --> 00:51:39.362
SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND CAL

00:51:39.429 --> 00:51:40.564
FIRE ARE ALLOWED TO DO

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:42.632
DEFENSIBLE SPACE WORK IN AREAS

00:51:42.699 --> 00:51:44.468
WHERE THE HOMEOWNERS WON'T DO IT --

00:51:44.534 --> 00:51:45.769
AREN'T ABLE TO DO IT DO YOU

00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:48.538
THINK THE CCC CAN BE HELPFUL AND

00:51:48.605 --> 00:51:50.140
AND ANY OF THAT WORK.

00:51:50.207 --> 00:51:52.409
I THINK WE CAN AND SHOULD WOULD

00:51:52.476 --> 00:51:54.044
TYPICALLY YOU KNOW WERE

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.046
PREVENTED FROM ME THE ERROR HAS

00:51:56.112 --> 00:51:57.280
TO BE OF BENEFIT TO THE PUBLIC

00:51:57.347 --> 00:51:58.949
AND TYPICALLY WE WOULD WORK ON

00:51:59.015 --> 00:52:00.917
PRIVATE PROPERTIES BUT WE DO

00:52:00.984 --> 00:52:02.352
WORK IN AND AROUND PRIVATE

00:52:02.419 --> 00:52:03.753
PROPERTIES.

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:06.790

COUNCIL SO THEY'RE HERE TO SO I

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:10.894
THINK THAT'S ONE WAY FOR US TO

00:52:10.961 --> 00:52:13.463
WORK ON THOSE PRIVATE PROPERTIES.

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:15.165
AND LET ME JUST ASK YOU IN IF IF

00:52:15.232 --> 00:52:16.766
THE CHIEF WANTS TO TO CHIME IN

00:52:16.833 --> 00:52:18.869
AS WELL THAT'S FINE THIS IS MY

00:52:18.935 --> 00:52:20.270
LAST QUESTION IS FOR MY

SOME ENERGY EFFICIENCY WORK AND

00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:27.444
COULD YOU BE INVOLVED IN HOME

00:52:27.511 --> 00:52:28.311

PUBLIC BENEFITS OF TYPICALLY AND

00:52:34.117 --> 00:52:36.019
HISTORICALLY WE HAVE NOT WORKED

RECENTLY ABOUT A CONSTRUCTION

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:44.995
CORPS MAYBE THERE COULD BE A

00:52:45.061 --> 00:52:46.997
HARDENING CORE I NEEDED

00:52:47.063 --> 00:52:48.932
DIFFERENT MARKETING --

00:52:48.999 --> 00:52:51.034

EFFICIENCY WORK THAT WE'VE DONE

00:52:55.005 --> 00:52:56.506
THEY'VE ALL BEEN ON PUBLIC OR

00:52:56.573 --> 00:52:57.941
NON-PROFIT BUILDINGS BUT I I'D

00:52:58.008 --> 00:52:59.476
BE INTRIGUED OR INTERESTED TO

00:52:59.543 --> 00:53:02.846
SEE IF THERE ARE.

00:53:02.913 --> 00:53:04.681
SOME WAY TO DO THIS.

00:53:07.751 --> 00:53:08.852
QUESTIONS.

00:53:08.919 --> 00:53:09.920
I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS

00:53:09.986 --> 00:53:12.122
REGARDING THIS YOU SEE SEE I SAY

00:53:12.188 --> 00:53:13.223
THAT OF MANY TREES SO YOU'RE

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:13.723
TAKING DOWN.

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:15.992
AND MANY TREES ARE PROBABLY

00:53:16.059 --> 00:53:17.527
CHIPPING SOME.

00:53:17.594 --> 00:53:18.895
BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF TREES THAT

00:53:18.962 --> 00:53:20.230
CAN'T GO THROUGH A CHIPPER --

00:53:20.297 --> 00:53:21.731
WHAT DO YOU WHAT ARE YOU DOING

00:53:21.798 --> 00:53:23.600
WITH THOSE TREES ARE THERE IS

00:53:23.667 --> 00:53:25.101
SOME KIND OF SOLUTION OF WHERE

00:53:25.168 --> 00:53:28.038
WE'RE GOING?

00:53:28.104 --> 00:53:29.406
TO GET RID OF SOME OF THAT WASTE.

00:53:29.472 --> 00:53:30.874
THERE'S ALWAYS A PLAN BECAUSE

00:53:30.941 --> 00:53:33.009
WE'RE NOT THE PONSOR OF A

00:53:33.076 --> 00:53:34.477
PROJECT LIKE THAT SO WE'LL WORK

00:53:34.544 --> 00:53:36.613
OUT SOME PLAN IN ADVANCE AND SO

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.281
YES OF THE CAN'T BE HAULED AWAY.

00:53:38.348 --> 00:53:40.917
IF IT CAN'T BE CHIPPED OF A CAT

00:53:40.984 --> 00:53:43.219
B. ROW SET UP LOG DACHSHUND

00:53:43.286 --> 00:53:44.020
STACKED --

00:53:44.087 --> 00:53:45.956
THEY'LL BE SOME KIND OF OPTION

00:53:46.022 --> 00:53:48.191
LIKE THAT AND NOT JUST OBVIOUSLY

00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:50.527
CUT DOWN THE LEAVES OF THE TREES

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:51.528
ARE TO BRING THEIR ON THEIR OFF

00:53:51.595 --> 00:53:54.364
THERE IS ALWAYS SOME PLAN OF THE

00:53:54.431 --> 00:53:56.066
WORK THAT WE DO.

00:53:56.132 --> 00:53:57.067
AND THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS

00:53:57.133 --> 00:54:01.972
THAT -- THE

00:54:02.038 --> 00:54:03.974
TO DO AS MANY PROBABLY HOMES ARE

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.742
CHECKING PROPERTIES --

00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:07.377
CAN BE CHALLENGING CONSIDERING

00:54:07.444 --> 00:54:09.379
WE'VE HAD FIRES PRETTY MUCH YEAR

00:54:09.446 --> 00:54:10.213
ROUND.

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:12.415
AND THE TIMING FOR YOU TO GO OUT

00:54:12.482 --> 00:54:14.150
AND ACTUALLY GO OUT AND CHECK

00:54:14.217 --> 00:54:14.818
THOSE --

00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:17.654
PROPERTIES MUST BE DIFFICULT --

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:19.089
DO YOU HAVE LIKE THIS BUT AS A

00:54:19.155 --> 00:54:20.991
SPECIFIC --

00:54:21.057 --> 00:54:21.558
TEAM THAT GOES OUT AND JUST

00:54:21.625 --> 00:54:24.294
LOOKS AT FIRED.

00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:26.296
DEFENSIBLE SPACER HOW'S THAT

00:54:26.363 --> 00:54:28.098
WORK WELL IT'S DONE AT THE UNIT

00:54:28.164 --> 00:54:29.699
LEVEL -- WE

00:54:29.766 --> 00:54:30.900
HAVE TWENTY ONE UNITS THROUGHOUT

00:54:30.967 --> 00:54:32.235
THE STATE IN IN --

00:54:32.302 --> 00:54:34.170
DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTORS FOUR

00:54:34.237 --> 00:54:36.272
STREETS HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATED

00:54:36.339 --> 00:54:37.974
IN EACH ONE OF THOSE UNITS --

00:54:41.277 --> 00:54:42.679
TYPICALLY ARE DEFENSIBLE SPACE

00:54:42.746 --> 00:54:44.547
INSPECTORS ARE SEASONAL.

00:54:44.614 --> 00:54:47.417

WORK RELATIVE TO THE PC'S WORK

00:55:23.953 --> 00:55:27.090
AND IN FIRE PREVENTION AND SO

00:55:27.157 --> 00:55:27.724
HOPEFULLY THE THAT THAT DOESN'T

00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:28.958
GO.

00:55:29.025 --> 00:55:30.627
TOO FAR BEYOND THE THE SCOPE OF

00:55:38.068 --> 00:55:42.205
OF THE DO YOU SEE 95% OF ALL --

00:55:42.272 --> 00:55:43.740
ARE CAUSED BY PEOPLE

00:55:43.807 --> 00:55:44.040
[inaudible]

00:55:44.107 --> 00:55:45.508
OKAY -- BUT

00:55:45.575 --> 00:55:46.976
ISN'T THE CASE THAT THEY AT

LEAST THE FOR FROM WHAT I RECALL

00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:51.514
THAT MOST OF THE MAJOR FIRES.

00:55:51.581 --> 00:55:53.216
THAT THE BIGGEST WATER FIRE IS

00:55:53.283 --> 00:55:55.885
IN IN IN RECENT YEARS --

00:55:55.952 --> 00:55:57.520
MANY IF NOT THE MAJORITY BEEN

00:55:57.587 --> 00:55:58.922

00:56:05.428 --> 00:56:06.362
NO.

00:56:06.429 --> 00:56:07.731
SOME OF THE BIGGER FIRES --

00:56:07.797 --> 00:56:09.299
ARE STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION OF

00:56:09.365 --> 00:56:10.767
COURSE NOW --

00:56:10.834 --> 00:56:13.303
BUT ON A DAY TO DAY THAT OF THE

00:56:13.369 --> 00:56:15.105
FIRES THAT OUR CREWS ROLL OUT ON

00:56:15.171 --> 00:56:16.706
A DAILY BASIS THE MAJORITY THERE

00:56:16.773 --> 00:56:18.074
MORE HUMAN CAUSED.

00:56:18.141 --> 00:56:20.310
EITHER TRYING TO CLEAR THEIR

00:56:28.384 --> 00:56:29.919
BAY IS IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT

00:56:29.986 --> 00:56:30.854
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME MAJOR

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:32.422
WILDFIRES THAT THAT HAVE BEEN

00:56:32.489 --> 00:56:39.028
CAUSED BY THE THE THE VEGETATION --

00:56:39.095 --> 00:56:42.766
SOME THE POWER LINES --

00:56:42.832 --> 00:56:45.802
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CASES THAT

00:56:45.869 --> 00:56:47.771
HAVE BEEN ADJUDICATED THIS. ONE

00:56:47.837 --> 00:56:48.905
WITH.

00:56:48.972 --> 00:56:51.007
WITH SUCH FINDINGS.

00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:52.242
IS THAT CORRECT CORRECT OKAY ALL

00:56:52.308 --> 00:56:54.277
RIGHT SO SO GIVEN THAT --

00:56:54.344 --> 00:56:55.378
IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIRE

00:56:55.445 --> 00:56:56.946
PREVENTION HERE THAT A BIG PART

00:56:57.013 --> 00:56:58.481
OF IT IS.

00:56:58.548 --> 00:57:00.083
IS -- THE

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:03.086
THE ELECTRICITY GRID --

00:57:03.153 --> 00:57:03.787
YOU KNOW.

00:57:03.853 --> 00:57:06.122
AND AND AND AND IT'S INTERACTION

00:57:06.189 --> 00:57:10.126
WITH THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT --

00:57:10.193 --> 00:57:13.830
THERE THERE THERE IS A RECENT --

00:57:13.897 --> 00:57:15.431
FINDING THAT --

00:57:15.498 --> 00:57:17.967
WE DISCUSSED IN THE ENERGY

00:57:18.034 --> 00:57:22.038
UTILITIES COMMITTEE HERE AIR --

00:57:22.105 --> 00:57:24.407
THE PRESIDENT OF THE PUBLIC

00:57:24.474 --> 00:57:26.176
UTILITIES COMMISSION ADMITTED

00:57:26.242 --> 00:57:27.343
THAT.

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:29.445
THAT THEY HAD NEVER --

00:57:29.512 --> 00:57:32.582
FIND A UTILITY.

00:57:32.649 --> 00:57:35.919
FOR FAILING TO TAKE NECESSARY

00:57:35.985 --> 00:57:38.688
FIRE PREVENTION --

00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:43.059
ACTIVITIES OR OUR EFFORTS --

00:57:43.126 --> 00:57:44.727
AND AND AND THAT CONCERNS ME

00:57:44.794 --> 00:57:47.664
BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT YOU KNOW

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:48.398
WE'RE WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING

00:57:48.464 --> 00:57:50.867
ABOUT STRUCTURES IN THE STATE

00:57:50.934 --> 00:57:53.937
RESPONSIBILITY AREAS BUT WORK.

00:57:54.003 --> 00:57:55.638
TALKING ABOUT THE ELECTRICITY

00:57:55.705 --> 00:57:58.274
GRID AND OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

00:57:58.341 --> 00:58:00.176
THOUSAND MILES OF OF POWER LINES

00:58:00.243 --> 00:58:01.611
RUNNING THROUGH SOME OF THE THE

00:58:01.678 --> 00:58:04.314
MOST FIRE PRONE AREAS IN OUR

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.849
STATE --

00:58:05.915 --> 00:58:10.153
DOES THE WAY WHAT IS CAL FIRE IS --

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:15.725
ROLE IN MONITORING THE UTILITIES --

00:58:15.792 --> 00:58:17.794
EFFORTS TO ON ON ON FIRE

00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:20.296
PREVENTION.

00:58:20.363 --> 00:58:21.731
WELL --

00:58:21.798 --> 00:58:23.766
BASICALLY OUR OUR ROLE IS THAT

00:58:23.833 --> 00:58:25.702
IF WE SEE WHAT WE THINK IS A

00:58:25.768 --> 00:58:27.337
VIOLATION WILL REPORT THAT AND

00:58:27.403 --> 00:58:29.239
ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL OR

00:58:29.305 --> 00:58:30.340
PREVENTION PERSONNEL WILL FOLLOW

00:58:30.406 --> 00:58:31.741
UP WITH IT.

00:58:31.808 --> 00:58:32.675
BUT IT'S ULTIMATELY THE

00:58:32.742 --> 00:58:35.111
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE UTILITY TO

00:58:35.178 --> 00:58:36.446
ENSURE THAT THE VEGETATION

00:58:36.512 --> 00:58:38.615
CLEARANCES ARE MAINTAINED.

00:58:38.681 --> 00:58:39.849
AND THE C. P. U.'S GENERAL

00:58:39.916 --> 00:58:42.418
SAFETY ORDERS REQUIRE THAT.

00:58:42.485 --> 00:58:43.453
THAT THEY ENFORCE THAT AND AND

00:58:43.519 --> 00:58:44.921
SO -- AND

00:58:44.988 --> 00:58:47.190
AND AND WHO WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY

00:58:47.257 --> 00:58:49.792
IS IT TO OVERSEE THE UTILITIES

00:58:49.859 --> 00:58:52.262
TO ENSURE THAT THERE ADEQUATELY

00:58:52.328 --> 00:58:54.731
AND EFFECTIVELY CONDUCTING --

00:58:54.797 --> 00:58:56.599
FIRE SAFETY INSPECTIONS.

00:58:56.666 --> 00:58:57.567
I WOULD SAY THAT WOULD BE THE

00:58:57.634 --> 00:58:58.701
CPUC ARE.

00:58:58.768 --> 00:59:01.237
SO AND AND WHAT --

00:59:01.304 --> 00:59:04.173
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE CAL THE

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.975
THE CPC IN TERMS OF FIRE

00:59:06.042 --> 00:59:07.777
PREVENTION ACTIVITIES --

00:59:07.844 --> 00:59:09.078
WE HAVE A COLLABORATIVE

00:59:09.145 --> 00:59:10.213
RELATIONSHIP --

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:11.648
AS I MENTIONED WE ENTERED INTO

00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:12.715
AN AMMO YOU ABOUT EIGHTEEN

00:59:12.782 --> 00:59:14.617
MONTHS AGO --

00:59:14.684 --> 00:59:16.619
AND IN THE INTENT OF THAT IMHO

00:59:16.686 --> 00:59:18.454
YOU WAS TO INCREASE THOSE

00:59:18.521 --> 00:59:19.789
COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS.

00:59:19.856 --> 00:59:22.692
SHARE INFORMATION AS APPROPRIATE --

00:59:22.759 --> 00:59:25.662
ON INSPECTION DATA AND AND IT

00:59:25.728 --> 00:59:27.931
BOTH ELECTRONIC AND OTHERWISE SO --

00:59:27.997 --> 00:59:29.699
AND THEN OF COURSE WITH THE SB

00:59:29.766 --> 00:59:31.000
NINE A ONE NOW WITH WELL FIRE

00:59:31.067 --> 00:59:32.635
MITIGATION PLANS WERE INVOLVED

00:59:32.702 --> 00:59:33.903
IN THAT PROCESS.

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:36.072
BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT --

00:59:36.139 --> 00:59:38.007
THE THE CPC IS STILL THE LEAD

00:59:38.074 --> 00:59:42.545
AGENCY IN TERMS OF AND THE

00:59:42.612 --> 00:59:45.548
ENFORCEMENT OF OF WILD FIRE

00:59:45.615 --> 00:59:49.352
PREVENTION ACTIVITIES AS THEY

00:59:49.419 --> 00:59:50.520
RELATE TO UTILITIES CORRECT.

00:59:50.586 --> 00:59:51.821
THE THE REQUIREMENTS ARE IN THE

00:59:51.888 --> 00:59:52.455
P. R. C..

00:59:52.522 --> 00:59:54.324
THE CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS.

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:55.858
AND IT'S THE THE UTILITIES

00:59:55.925 --> 00:59:58.127
RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT

00:59:58.194 --> 01:00:00.897
THOSE THOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE MET.

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:03.166
AND THE CPU.

01:00:03.232 --> 01:00:05.802
YOU SEE HAS SOME OVERSIGHT AND

01:00:05.868 --> 01:00:06.869
THE CPC RATHER GENERAL SAFETY

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:09.272
ORDERS DOES CAL FIRE HAVING

01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:09.973
OVERSIGHT OVER THE HILL AS

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:11.507
THERE'S NO MANDATE FOR US TO DO

01:00:11.574 --> 01:00:13.609
INSPECTIONS --

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:15.511
BUT IT BUT AS I MENTIONED THAT

01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:17.780
WHEN OUR CREWS ARE OUT SOME UNIT

01:00:17.847 --> 01:00:19.382
TO DO DO --

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:20.984
DO DRIVE THE LINES AND THEY'LL

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:25.521
SITE OF VIOLATIONS --

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:28.524
BUT WHEN OUR CREWS ARE THE

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:29.525
REPORTED THINK IT'S FOLLOWED UP

01:00:29.592 --> 01:00:33.730
ON BY OUR FIRE PREVENTION STAFF.

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:35.498
THAT'S CERTAINLY HOW WORKS.

01:00:35.565 --> 01:00:38.301
DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION AS TO HOW

01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:39.869
GOOD OF A JOB THE CPC IS DOING

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:43.439
IN TERMS OF ENFORCING --

01:00:43.506 --> 01:00:45.608
THE WHAT FOR PROTECT THE WHY

01:00:45.675 --> 01:00:48.478

THEY RELATE RELATE TO UTILITIES.

01:00:50.713 --> 01:00:51.681
I DIDN'T.

01:00:51.748 --> 01:00:55.418
DO YOU HAVE A OPINION AS TO THE

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:58.287
IN THE THE THE THE NATURE AND

01:00:58.354 --> 01:01:01.457
THE EXTENT OF THE COOPERATION

01:01:01.524 --> 01:01:02.392
BETWEEN.

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:04.460
THE CPC AND CAL FIRE AS THEY

01:01:04.527 --> 01:01:05.228
RELATE.

01:01:05.294 --> 01:01:06.229
TO WHAT FIRE AND PREVENTION

01:01:06.295 --> 01:01:07.864

OUTREACH AND RESEARCH AND MY

01:10:25.621 --> 01:10:26.855
COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE WORKED IN

01:10:26.922 --> 01:10:29.191
THIS ISSUE OF OF HOME SURVIVAL

01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:30.726
IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT.

01:10:30.793 --> 01:10:32.861
WHAT WE CAN DO TO TO BUILD

01:10:32.928 --> 01:10:34.897
SMARTER --

01:10:34.964 --> 01:10:36.198
TO TODAY'S PRESENTATION IS IS

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:37.666
DESIGNED TO TO TRY AND ADDRESS

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:39.001
SOME OF THOSE PIECES IT'S

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:41.136
GROUNDED IN BOTH THE OBSERVATION

01:10:41.203 --> 01:10:43.906
OF OF MANY WILDFIRES AS WELL AS

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:45.107
IN -- MORE

01:10:45.174 --> 01:10:47.576
EMPIRICAL LABORATORY BASED STUDY

01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:49.545
SO I'VE GOT A FEW SLIDES HERE --

01:10:49.612 --> 01:10:51.013
JUST TO ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THE

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:51.614
CONCEPTS BECAUSE I THINK IT'LL

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.115
SLIDE SPEAK BETTER THAN THE

01:10:53.182 --> 01:10:54.416
WORDS THEMSELVES.

01:10:54.483 --> 01:10:55.317
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TAKE

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:56.318
HOME POINTS HERE.

01:10:56.385 --> 01:10:57.886
AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO TO START

01:10:57.953 --> 01:10:59.888
WITH AND AND THAT IS THAT WE

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:01.457
HAVE A FIRE FIGHTING AGENCY

01:11:01.523 --> 01:11:03.092
WHICH AND ANNA FIRE FIGHTING

01:11:03.158 --> 01:11:04.593
APPARATUS AND AND I LOVE THE

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:06.462
CONCEPT BUT I'D LIKE TO SORT OF

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:08.397
STEP BACK A LITTLE BIT AND THINK

01:11:08.464 --> 01:11:09.365
ABOUT THE FACT THAT.

01:11:09.431 --> 01:11:10.799
IT WITH OTHER NATURAL FORCES

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:13.102
SUCH AS EARTHQUAKES TORNADOES OR

01:11:13.168 --> 01:11:14.837
HURRICANES WE DON'T FIGHT THEM.

01:11:14.903 --> 01:11:16.238
RIGHT WE ADOPTED WE BUILD

01:11:16.305 --> 01:11:18.807
SMARTER AND SO I THINK THERE'S A

01:11:18.874 --> 01:11:20.242
A ROOM AND A NEED FOR A SEA

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:21.877
CHANGE IN THINKING ABOUT OUR

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:23.012
RELATIONSHIP WITH FIRE.

01:11:23.078 --> 01:11:25.280
CALIFORNIA IS YOU KNOW VERY MUCH

01:11:25.347 --> 01:11:26.649
OF THE VEGETATION IS FIRE

01:11:26.715 --> 01:11:27.983
ADOPTED IN SOME RESPECTS IT'S

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:29.785
ALSO FIRE DEPENDED SO HOW DO WE

01:11:29.852 --> 01:11:32.154
GET THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND.

01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:32.988
AND HOW DO WE WORK TOGETHER TO

01:11:33.055 --> 01:11:35.324
DRY AND ADOPTED BUILD SMARTER --

01:11:35.391 --> 01:11:36.892
SIMILAR YOU KNOW TO WHAT WE DO

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:41.030
WITH FOUNDATIONS WITH YOU KNOW

01:11:41.096 --> 01:11:42.931
ALL THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE HOMES.

01:11:42.998 --> 01:11:43.699
AS DISCUSSED EARLIER THE

01:11:43.766 --> 01:11:44.900
MAJORITY OF HOMES ARE LOST FROM

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:45.768
EMBERS IT'LL SHOW YOU SOME

01:11:45.834 --> 01:11:46.368
IMAGES OF WHAT THOSE ARE IN A

01:11:46.435 --> 01:11:47.503
MINUTE --

01:11:47.569 --> 01:11:48.904
BUT THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM A

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:51.206
FLAMING FRONT WHICH MOST PEOPLE

01:11:51.273 --> 01:11:51.807
THINK ABOUT WHEN IT COMES THE

01:11:51.874 --> 01:11:52.775
FIRE.

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:54.176
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT NEW

01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:56.078
BUILDING CODES ARE HELPING --

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:56.712
THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT PERFECT

01:11:56.779 --> 01:11:59.748
YET AND WE CAN SEE THAT IN

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:01.984
PARADISE WHERE 25% OF THE HOMES

01:12:02.051 --> 01:12:03.052
THAT --

01:12:03.118 --> 01:12:05.387
SURVIVE POST TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

01:12:05.454 --> 01:12:05.587
WILL.

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:07.423
POST TWO THOUSAND A CONSTRUCTION

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:09.658
25% OF THE HOUSES SURVIVED.

01:12:09.725 --> 01:12:11.260
OF LET'S NOT OF HIGH THAT WOULD

01:12:11.326 --> 01:12:11.593
HAVE LIKE --

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:12.261
TO BUT IF IT DOES SHOW THAT WE

01:12:12.327 --> 01:12:13.662
ARE HOW WE ARE CAPABLE OF MAKING

01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:15.164
A DIFFERENCE SO HOW DO WE

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:16.932
INCENTIVIZE THE UPGRADES TO THE

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:18.701
EXISTING HOMES AND NOT PROCESS

01:12:18.767 --> 01:12:19.268
AND I THINK THAT'S THE OPEN

01:12:19.334 --> 01:12:20.302
QUESTION.

01:12:20.369 --> 01:12:22.104
ON THE FLOOR TODAY SO WHAT I'D

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:23.739
LIKE TO TO LEAVE WITH IS REALLY

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:25.274
THIS IDEA OF WHAT WE THINK ABOUT

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:27.743
WITH PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE.

01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:29.244
FORTY TWO NINETY ONE AND WHAT

01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:29.812
CAN WE DO AROUND DEFENSIBLE

01:12:29.878 --> 01:12:30.546
SPACE -- AND

01:12:30.612 --> 01:12:31.513
HOW DO WE GET THE PUBLIC TO

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.182
BETTER UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE

01:12:33.248 --> 01:12:35.017
OF A NON COMBUSTIBLE ZONE

01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:36.285
IMMEDIATELY AROUND THEIR HOUSE.

01:12:36.351 --> 01:12:37.419
INSTEAD OF THINKING ABOUT

01:12:37.486 --> 01:12:38.220
WORKING FROM THE PROPERTY IN

01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:39.688
WERE TO THE HOUSE AND HOW DO YOU

01:12:39.755 --> 01:12:41.123
WORK FOR THE PROPERTY OUTWARD

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:43.025
AND TAKE CARE OF OUR STUFF RIGHT

01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:43.859
IT'S IT'S KIND OF THAT CURTILAGE

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:45.060
THEM WHERE PEOPLE THINK IT'S A

01:12:45.127 --> 01:12:46.428
LITTLE BIT OFF LIMITS BUT IN

01:12:46.495 --> 01:12:48.163
REALITY IT'S MAKING A MAJOR.

01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:48.764
DIFFERENCE IN THE SURVIVAL OF

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:52.935
HOMES LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF

01:12:53.001 --> 01:12:53.736
THOSE IMAGES.

01:12:53.802 --> 01:12:54.803
SO I WILL BE ABLE TO TALK IN

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:55.471
EXTENSIVE DETAIL BUT IT'S WANT

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:56.605
TO GIVE YOU THE SENSE THAT.

01:12:56.672 --> 01:12:58.107
THE BUILDING CODES ARE DESIGNED

01:12:58.173 --> 01:13:00.008
AND A TO THINK ABOUT DIFFERENT

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:03.212
TYPES OF FLAME CONTACT A RADIANT

01:13:03.278 --> 01:13:06.215
HEAT OR EMBERS AND THERE ARE

01:13:06.281 --> 01:13:07.616
IMPORTANT NUANCES IN EACH OF

01:13:07.683 --> 01:13:09.051
THOSE TYPES OF EXPOSURES WITH

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:10.619
YOU HAVE. TOO MUCH HEAT RIGHT

01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:11.120
OUTSIDE THE OUTSIDE YOUR

01:13:11.186 --> 01:13:14.089
BUILDING LOS CAUSES COMBUSTION

01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:15.991
WHETHER OF FLAMES THAT DIRECTLY

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:16.558
TOUCH THE HOUSE OR WHETHER

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:17.459
YOU'RE BEING.

01:13:17.526 --> 01:13:19.027
YOU KNOW BOMBARDED WITH THE

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:20.462
HAILSTORM OF LITTLE BITS OF

01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:22.531
BURNING EMBERS A AND THAT'S OF A

01:13:22.598 --> 01:13:25.067
PICTURE OF THE LAB THAT'S IN --

01:13:25.134 --> 01:13:26.401
SOUTH CAROLINA THAT WE'RE SO

01:13:26.468 --> 01:13:27.770
MUCH OF THIS IS TESTED JUST TO

01:13:27.836 --> 01:13:28.904
GIVE YOU AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE

01:13:28.971 --> 01:13:30.405
KIND OF SCALE AND MODELING

01:13:30.472 --> 01:13:32.541
THAT'S DONE TO BE ABLE TO

01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:33.008
EVALUATE THESE ISSUES

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:33.308
[inaudible]

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:34.743
SO.

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:35.611
AS A AS WAS SAID EARLIER

01:13:35.677 --> 01:13:36.979
WINDBLOWN MEMBERS ARE

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:38.947
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF

01:13:39.014 --> 01:13:40.115
BUILDING IGNITIONS AND YOU CAN

01:13:40.182 --> 01:13:41.583
SEE THIS PICTURE I THINK FOR A

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:43.452
FROM SOUTH LAKE TAHOE WITH THE

01:13:43.519 --> 01:13:44.686
ANGORA FIRE WHERE THERE'S ALMOST.

01:13:44.753 --> 01:13:46.054
YOU KNOW VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE OF

01:13:46.121 --> 01:13:48.357
FIRE IN THE SURROUNDING --

01:13:48.423 --> 01:13:49.792
FORESTED SETTING BUT THE HOME IS

01:13:49.858 --> 01:13:51.593
LOST SO HOW DID THAT HAPPEN

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:52.995
RIGHT MOST PEOPLE CAN'T GRASP

01:13:53.061 --> 01:13:54.163
THAT THAT YOU THESE NUMBERS ARE

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:55.597
CAPABLE OF MOVING MORE THAN A

01:13:55.664 --> 01:13:56.999
MILE IN FRONT OF A FLAMING FRONT.

01:13:57.065 --> 01:13:59.268
AND AND CAUSING THESE KINDS OF

01:13:59.334 --> 01:14:00.369
LOSSES.

01:14:00.435 --> 01:14:01.737
SO THERE YOU KNOW EVERYONE WANTS

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:02.571
TO KNOW WHAT TO DO AND WHERE TO

01:14:02.638 --> 01:14:04.273
START AND THAT'S BEYOND WHAT I

01:14:04.339 --> 01:14:05.207
HAVE TIME TO TALK ABOUT HERE

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:06.909
TODAY BUT JUST TO SAY THERE ARE

01:14:06.975 --> 01:14:07.843
PRIORITIES.

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:08.911
THE SHIFT DEPENDING IF YOU'RE

01:14:08.977 --> 01:14:10.445
NEIGHBORING HOUSES VERY CLOSE TO

01:14:10.512 --> 01:14:12.047
YOU WHETHER YOU HAVE SOME

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:13.549
SEPARATION BETWEEN BUILDINGS.

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:14.917
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF

01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:16.351
COURSE IS THE ROOF AND THE ROOF

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:17.553
EDGE -- AND

01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:18.821
THEN THE VENTILATION SYSTEM

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:19.788
WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT FOR

01:14:19.855 --> 01:14:21.990
LETTING THAT WARM MOIST AIR OUT

01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:23.258
YOUR HOUSE YOUR YOU KNOW SECURE.

01:14:23.325 --> 01:14:24.760
WOULD DOESN'T ROT ON THE INSIDE

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:25.394
YOUR HOUSES WITHOUT A CLAIM THE

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.696
AWFUL ENVIRONMENT BUT ALSO TO BE

01:14:27.763 --> 01:14:29.932
STRONG AND BE ABLE TO RESIST OF

01:14:29.998 --> 01:14:31.500
THE THE INTRUSION OF EMBERS.

01:14:31.567 --> 01:14:33.135
SO YOU NEED YOU NEED SORT OF

01:14:33.202 --> 01:14:34.403
LIKE THE GORE TEX OF YOUR HOUSE

01:14:34.469 --> 01:14:35.838
IF YOU CAN THINK OF IT THAT WAY.

01:14:35.904 --> 01:14:37.506
AND THEN THE VEGETATION

01:14:37.573 --> 01:14:38.540
DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND BECOMES

01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:39.875
KIND OF THIRD AND THAT PRIORITY

01:14:39.942 --> 01:14:42.311
LIST -- AND

01:14:42.377 --> 01:14:42.911
THEN WE COULD TALK MORE IF WE

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:45.814
HAD MORE TIME THOSE PIECES BUT I

01:14:45.881 --> 01:14:48.083
WON'T I WON'T GO INTO THAT NOW.

01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:49.117
WELL LET'S JUST THINK A LITTLE

01:14:49.184 --> 01:14:51.153
BIT ABOUT THESE POINTS OF ENTRY

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:53.322
AROUND THE HOME ITSELF SO --

01:14:53.388 --> 01:14:55.290
IF YOUR HOME IS --

01:14:55.357 --> 01:14:57.259
UNLUCKY TO BE BOMBARDED BY THOSE

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:58.827
EMBERS YOU MIGHT HAVE LOST

01:14:58.894 --> 01:15:00.829
BECAUSE YOU HAVE VEGETATION LIKE

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:01.396
LITTLE --

01:15:01.463 --> 01:15:03.232
LATER LEAVES ON THE ON THE

01:15:03.298 --> 01:15:05.167
CONNECTION BETWEEN IF YOU CAN

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:06.435
SEE NOW I GUESS I GET SHOULD THE

01:15:06.501 --> 01:15:08.203
FOR RIGHT HERE WHERE YOU'VE GOT --

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:09.805
THE ROOF TO WALL CONTACT RIGHT

01:15:09.872 --> 01:15:10.873
THERE AND THEN YOU CAN SEE THAT

01:15:10.939 --> 01:15:12.741
THAT WALL IS NOT RESISTANT TO

01:15:12.808 --> 01:15:14.142
THE FLAMES AND AND FIRE CAN

01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:15.744
ENTER THAT WAY OR YOUR RAIN

01:15:15.811 --> 01:15:17.079
GUTTER CAN CATCH ON FIRE IF YOU

01:15:17.145 --> 01:15:18.580
HAVE A LEAVES OR NEEDLES IN

01:15:18.647 --> 01:15:19.481
THERE AND THEN.

01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:21.049
GET UNDERNEATH YOUR ROOFING.

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:22.150
OR IF YOU'RE ON FORTUNATE TO

01:15:22.217 --> 01:15:24.253
HAVE A FENCE AND THE FENCE

01:15:24.319 --> 01:15:25.754
ESSENTIALLY CUTS OUT CATCHES ON

01:15:25.821 --> 01:15:27.222
FIRE AGAIN FROM THE EMBERS AND

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:27.789
THEN WICKS THE FIRE TO YOUR

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:28.557
HOUSE.

01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:30.058
SO THESE ARE THESE ARE COMMON

01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:31.260
POINTS OF ENTRY.

01:15:31.326 --> 01:15:32.327
THE OTHER POINT OF ENTRY OR

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:33.595
THESE EVENTS WHICH I WAS JUST

01:15:33.662 --> 01:15:34.897
TALKING ABOUT AND THIS IS --

01:15:34.963 --> 01:15:36.265
FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE AND YOU

01:15:36.331 --> 01:15:38.800
CAN SEE THE EMBERS THEMSELVES --

01:15:38.867 --> 01:15:40.135
COMING INSIDE THE HOUSE SO

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:41.703
THAT'S A PICTURE SHOWING WHAT

01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:42.971
WOULD BE LIKE FROM EITHER GABLE

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:44.373
AND DARRON UNDER EVEN AT THE

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:45.874
DEPEND IF YOU STORE ANYTHING IN

01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:46.408
YOUR ATTIC.

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:49.711
OF YOU'RE LIKELY TO HAVE A IN

01:15:49.778 --> 01:15:52.648
ACNE IT'S THE HOME PIECE BUT

01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:53.916
LET'S TALK ABOUT SORT OF WHAT'S

01:15:53.982 --> 01:15:56.652
ON ON THE BOOKS AROUND FORTY TWO

01:15:56.718 --> 01:15:58.320
NINETY ONE INDEFENSIBLE SPACE --

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:00.055
WE HAVE SORT OF TWO ZONES --

01:16:00.122 --> 01:16:01.390
SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW FARTHER

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:03.792
AWAY THE REDUCED FEELS OWN FROM

01:16:03.859 --> 01:16:05.594
FOR THE PROPERTY LINE TWO OR TWO

01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:06.461
HUNDRED FEET --

01:16:06.528 --> 01:16:07.829
AND THEN WE HAVE THE SKINNER

01:16:07.896 --> 01:16:09.631
DEFENSIBLE SPACE ZONE BUT THIS

01:16:09.698 --> 01:16:10.465
IS THE KIND OF MATERIAL SO WE'VE

01:16:10.532 --> 01:16:11.733
BEEN PRETTY PRODUCING AND YOU

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.235
CAN SEE THAT THERE'S THIS NICE

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:14.102
LITTLE --

01:16:14.169 --> 01:16:16.004
SET OF FLOWERS OUTSIDE OUTSIDE

01:16:16.071 --> 01:16:17.272
THE HOUSE AND THAT GIVES THE

01:16:17.339 --> 01:16:18.874
PUBLIC A PERCEPTION THAT IT'S

01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:21.276
OKAY TO BE PUTTING VEGETATION

01:16:21.343 --> 01:16:23.145
RIGHT CLOSE UP TO THE HOUSE AND

01:16:23.211 --> 01:16:24.646
IT'S JUST IT'S JUST NOT NOT

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:26.014
CORRECT --

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:28.250
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE FROM PARADISE --

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:29.918
THIS IS AMBER DAMAGE YOU CAN SEE

01:16:29.985 --> 01:16:31.019
THE EMBERS IN THE PALM OF THE

01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:32.888
HAND THAT'S LITTLE BITS OF COAL

01:16:32.955 --> 01:16:34.823
IT WERE IN THE LAWN --

01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:36.124
THIS HOUSE PROBABLY WAS BUILT

01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:39.695
AROUND 200-010-2000 --

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:40.595
TWELVE THERE'S A CUSHION THAT

01:16:40.662 --> 01:16:42.264
SHOWS KIND OF THE THE LEVEL OF

01:16:42.331 --> 01:16:43.632
BURNING THAT HAPPENED AS THOSE

01:16:43.699 --> 01:16:44.199
NUMBERS WERE BEING THROWN

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:45.701
AGAINST THAT HOUSE.

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:47.602
MEMBERS CLEARLY CROSSED THIS

01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:50.505
LAWN AND YOU'VE GOT BLACK HERE

01:16:50.572 --> 01:16:51.606
AND THAT WAS ALL WITH --

01:16:51.673 --> 01:16:53.308
COMBUSTIBLE MULCHES AND THEY

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:54.676
WERE PLANTINGS THE HOUSE

01:16:54.743 --> 01:16:56.912
SURVIVED BUT EVERYONE OF THOSE

01:16:56.979 --> 01:16:58.714
WINDOWS IS CRACKED A AND THE

01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:01.350
FIRST PAIN HAS HAS HAS BROKEN --

01:17:01.416 --> 01:17:02.451
THE GOOD NEWS IS THE HOUSE

01:17:02.517 --> 01:17:04.920
SURVIVED BUT HAD THEY NOT HAD

01:17:04.987 --> 01:17:06.288
THIS KIND OF COMBUSTIBLE MULCH

01:17:06.355 --> 01:17:07.856
AND VEGETATION PLANTED RIGHT UP

01:17:07.923 --> 01:17:09.257
AGAINST THE HOUSE I DON'T THINK

01:17:09.324 --> 01:17:12.761
THERE WOULD BE ANY DAMAGE TO THE

01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:14.563
HOME.

01:17:14.629 --> 01:17:15.530
EL AND HERE'S ANOTHER

01:17:15.597 --> 01:17:16.164
ILLUSTRATION FROM THE CAR FIRE

01:17:16.231 --> 01:17:16.832
AGAIN IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THIS

01:17:16.898 --> 01:17:18.200
HOME WAS ANYWHERE NEAR A FIRE

01:17:18.266 --> 01:17:20.068
BUT THE FIRE TORNADO WAS CAME IN

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:21.703
RIGHT BEHIND THIS HOUSE.

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:23.238
AGAIN THE EMBERS WENT OVER THE

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:25.974
LAWN AND HEAR SOME BOX WOULD AND

01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:27.142
AGAIN EACH OF THOSE WINDOWS IS

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:28.777
BROKEN AS WELL --

01:17:28.844 --> 01:17:31.646
SO IT WOULD BE NICE IF FOR

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:33.148
GUIDANCE AND FOR HAD A MORE

01:17:33.215 --> 01:17:35.217
MAINSTREAM UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

01:17:35.283 --> 01:17:36.918
THIS WHAT THIS AREA IMMEDIATELY

01:17:36.985 --> 01:17:38.086
AROUND THE HOUSE.

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:40.822
IS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS --

01:17:40.889 --> 01:17:41.423
FOR HOME HARDENING AS WELL AS

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:42.491
THE FENCE.

01:17:42.557 --> 01:17:44.092
SO THE MAIN MUCH METRIC HERE IS

01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:44.860
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TEACH

01:17:44.926 --> 01:17:46.428
PEOPLE TO WORK FROM THE HOUSE

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:48.363
OUTWARD AND TRYING TO BRING FOR

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:49.931
THIS IDEA OF A NON COMBUSTIBLES

01:17:49.998 --> 01:17:51.333
ANSWERED IMMEDIATELY AROUND THE

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.901
HOUSE -- TO

01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:54.970
PROVIDE GREATER GREATER GUIDANCE

01:17:55.037 --> 01:17:56.905
OVERALL --

01:17:56.972 --> 01:17:58.440
AND I GUESS WITH THAT.

01:17:58.507 --> 01:18:00.709
I THINK ALL CONCLUDES SO THANK

01:18:00.776 --> 01:18:05.113
YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:07.649
THANK YOU I WILL BE ON YANIS

01:18:07.716 --> 01:18:09.818
TEAM ANY DAY [inaudible]

01:18:09.885 --> 01:18:11.987
GREAT JOB.

01:18:12.054 --> 01:18:13.922
SO THANK YOU CHEERS ASSEMBLY

01:18:13.989 --> 01:18:14.823
MEMBERS --

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:16.725
AND MISTER JARED FOR THE

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:17.859
INVITATION TO SPEAK TODAY.

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:19.694
ARE YOU HAVE MY BIO SO I'VE BEEN

01:18:19.761 --> 01:18:21.630
INTRODUCED.

01:18:21.696 --> 01:18:22.264
AND COULD YOU PULL UP THE POWER

01:18:22.330 --> 01:18:28.703
POINT.

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:31.540
SO WHILE OF WHAT HE DOES THAT.

01:18:31.606 --> 01:18:32.908
I'D LIKE TO START THE

01:18:32.974 --> 01:18:35.277
PRESENTATION WITH THREE POINTS

01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:36.778
THAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:38.080
THROUGHOUT THE DAY PER

01:18:38.146 --> 01:18:39.448
THROUGHOUT THE CONVERSATION.

01:18:39.514 --> 01:18:41.716
THE FIRST IS THAT HOME HARDENING

01:18:41.783 --> 01:18:43.885
IS ONE OF THE MOST FINANCIALLY

01:18:43.952 --> 01:18:46.455
EFFECTIVE WAYS TO DEAL WITH WILD

01:18:46.521 --> 01:18:47.389
FIRE THREAT.

01:18:47.456 --> 01:18:49.024
SO HOME HARDENING IS AT THE

01:18:49.091 --> 01:18:50.425
CENTER OF HOW WE MIGHT MAKE

01:18:50.492 --> 01:18:52.227
INVESTMENTS FOR COMMUNITY

01:18:52.294 --> 01:18:55.030
RESILIENCY RELATIVE TO WILD FIRE.

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:56.832
THE SECOND POINT IS THAT DOING

01:18:56.898 --> 01:18:58.600
SO IS GOING TO TAKE A TREMENDOUS

01:18:58.667 --> 01:18:59.668
LEVEL OF STATE AND LOCAL

01:18:59.734 --> 01:19:01.103
PARTNERSHIPS.

01:19:01.169 --> 01:19:02.037
IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND

01:19:02.104 --> 01:19:04.573
THE THIRD.

01:19:04.639 --> 01:19:06.141
I'D LIKE TO HAVE A SERIOUS

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:07.943
CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT

01:19:08.009 --> 01:19:10.011
HAZARD VERSUS RISK.

01:19:10.078 --> 01:19:11.713
BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT AND WE

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:13.215
NEED TO MEASURE DIFFERENT THINGS

01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:14.249
IN ORDER TO KNOW HOW WE'RE

01:19:14.316 --> 01:19:19.121
DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE.

01:19:19.187 --> 01:19:20.188
SO THIS IS WHAT THE PROBLEM

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:22.157
LOOKS LIKE FROM A NUMERICAL

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:24.059
STANDPOINT RELATIVE TO COMMUNITY

01:19:24.126 --> 01:19:25.527
RESILIENCY HOME HARDENING AND

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:26.895
WILDFIRES THIS IS HOW THE

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:28.130
INSURANCE INDUSTRY.

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:30.532
LOOKS AT CALIFORNIA.

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:31.900
THEY LOOK AT IT IN A NUMBER OF

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:33.935
WAYS THEY LOOK AT IT DOWN TO THE

01:19:34.002 --> 01:19:35.437
HOUSE LEVEL.

01:19:35.504 --> 01:19:37.639
BUT THIS IS HOW ON A STATEWIDE

01:19:37.706 --> 01:19:39.674
BASIS WE'RE LOOKING AT WHERE THE

01:19:39.741 --> 01:19:41.510
PROBLEMS OCCUR THE PERCENTAGES

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:44.079
OF STRUCTURES IN PRIMARILY THOSE

01:19:44.146 --> 01:19:45.814
RURAL COUNTIES WHERE THE

01:19:45.881 --> 01:19:47.215
INSURANCE INDUSTRY THINGS ARE

01:19:47.282 --> 01:19:49.718
PROBLEMS THE WORST.

01:19:49.784 --> 01:19:52.287
THE ANALYSIS UP BY VERA SKI IS

01:19:52.354 --> 01:19:53.355
THERE ARE ROUGHLY TWO MILLION

01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:55.824
HOMES THAT ARE EXISTING HOUSING

01:19:55.891 --> 01:19:57.826
STOCK BUILT PRIOR TO THE TWO

01:19:57.893 --> 01:20:00.028
THOUSAND AND EIGHT R. IMPACT OF

01:20:00.095 --> 01:20:01.229
THE BUILDING CODES.

01:20:01.296 --> 01:20:02.864
THAT WE HAVE AS A PROBLEM SETS

01:20:02.931 --> 01:20:04.065
SO I LIKE TO THINK OF THINGS

01:20:04.132 --> 01:20:06.101
ANALYTICALLY AND I APPROACH THIS

01:20:06.168 --> 01:20:07.869
QUESTION ABOUT HOME HARDENING

01:20:07.936 --> 01:20:09.604
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF IT TO

01:20:09.671 --> 01:20:11.773
TWO MILLION HOUSE PROBLEM HOW

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:14.576
WOULD WE APPROACH THAT.

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:16.945
SO ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR TO

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:17.779
REMEMBER IS WE ARE ON A

01:20:17.846 --> 01:20:19.714
HARDENING TIMELINE THIS IS NOT

01:20:19.781 --> 01:20:20.916
THE FIRST TIME THAT PEOPLE HAVE

01:20:20.982 --> 01:20:22.517
SAT IN FRONT OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:24.085
OR COMMISSIONS AND TALKED ABOUT

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:26.655
THIS ISSUE. NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR

01:20:26.721 --> 01:20:27.656
PIERCY FORTY TWO NINETY ONE WAS

01:20:27.722 --> 01:20:28.723
CUED UP.

01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:30.192
THAT WAS DONE SO THAT HOUSE

01:20:30.258 --> 01:20:32.594
FIRES DID NOT IGNITE FORESTS BUT

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:33.895
NOW ARE USING IT TO PROTECT

01:20:33.962 --> 01:20:37.933
COMMUNITIES FROM FOREST FIRES.

01:20:37.999 --> 01:20:38.567
NINETEEN NINETY ONE POST TUNNEL

01:20:38.633 --> 01:20:41.303
FIRE IN OAKLAND WE ENACTED AB A

01:20:41.369 --> 01:20:43.305
BASICALLY A BAN ON WOOD ROOFING

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:44.839
IN THE BUILDING CODES AND THAT

01:20:44.906 --> 01:20:46.041
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THAT WAS

01:20:46.107 --> 01:20:47.108
THE PERIOD WHEN I WAS THE STATE

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:48.910
FIRE MARSHAL WE ADOPTED THE

01:20:48.977 --> 01:20:49.945
WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE

01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:51.613
BUILDING CODES.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.747
AND ITS COROLLARY CHAPTER IN THE

01:20:52.814 --> 01:20:54.716
CALIFORNIA FIRE CODE THROUGH THE

01:20:54.783 --> 01:20:56.351
BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION

01:20:56.418 --> 01:20:57.385
AND THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S

01:20:57.452 --> 01:20:59.421
OFFICE SO I WANT TO KIND OF CALL

01:20:59.487 --> 01:21:00.722
OUT SOME KUDOS TO THE BUILDING

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:01.623
STANDARDS COMMISSION FOR BEING A

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:03.024
CENTRAL PART.

01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:05.493
OF THIS ISSUE AND THE STATE'S

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.362
BUILDING OFFICIALS.

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:08.363
SO.

01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:09.331
CONCEPT NUMBER --

01:21:09.397 --> 01:21:09.898
ONE POINT NUMBER ONE THAT I

01:21:09.965 --> 01:21:12.033
WANTED TO LEAVE YOU WITH A THE

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:13.201
HARDENED HOME.

01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:14.436
IT IS BOTH THE BUILDING

01:21:14.502 --> 01:21:15.470
MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:17.739
TECHNIQUES IT'S THE MATERIALS

01:21:17.806 --> 01:21:19.174
AND HOW THEY ARE APPLIED TO THE

01:21:19.241 --> 01:21:20.909
STRUCTURE.

01:21:20.976 --> 01:21:22.844
AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE.

01:21:22.911 --> 01:21:24.679
BUT YOU MUST MAINTAIN IN ORDER

01:21:24.746 --> 01:21:26.448
TO HAVE A HARDEN HOME THE CODES

01:21:26.514 --> 01:21:28.683
THEMSELVES PRESUME THAT BOTH ARE

01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:30.085
PRESENT AND THE REASON THAT THE

01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:31.620
COACH PRESUME THAT IS.

01:21:31.686 --> 01:21:33.255
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE DEFENSIBLE

01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:35.123
SPACE YOU HAVE TO BUILD NON

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:36.725
COMBUSTIBLE BUILDINGS AND THE

01:21:36.791 --> 01:21:38.727
COST AND CAPABILITY FOR US TO

01:21:38.793 --> 01:21:40.195
BUILD THOSE TYPES OF STRUCTURES

01:21:40.262 --> 01:21:40.862
OUT THERE.

01:21:40.929 --> 01:21:43.031
IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE SO

01:21:43.098 --> 01:21:45.267
WE SAID THERE MUST BE BOTH

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:48.403
DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND BILL

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:49.170
IGNITION RESISTANT BUILDING

01:21:49.237 --> 01:21:51.273
MATERIALS FOR THIS TO SUCCEED

01:21:51.339 --> 01:21:53.041
AND WE ARE NOT YET SUCCESSFUL IN

01:21:53.108 --> 01:21:57.445
ENFORCING BOTH OF THOSE ASPECTS.

01:21:57.512 --> 01:21:59.814
THIS IS A A SLIDE FROM A GROUP

01:21:59.881 --> 01:22:00.448
THAT'S CURRENTLY AT WORK I'VE

01:22:00.515 --> 01:22:00.949
BEEN READING CALLED THE

01:22:01.016 --> 01:22:02.484
COMMUNITY PLANNING FOR

01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:03.952
ASSISTANCE FOR WILD FIRE --

01:22:04.019 --> 01:22:04.819
YOU MIGHT HAVE READ SOME

01:22:04.886 --> 01:22:06.955
ARTICLES ABOUT THAT DIFFICULT TO

01:22:07.022 --> 01:22:08.523
SEE THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS BUT

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:10.392
AS A AS CHIEF RICH WINE

01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:13.128
MENTIONED SYSTEMATIC APPROACHES

01:22:13.194 --> 01:22:14.529
WITH A MULTIPLE OF DIFFERENT

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:16.531
MEDICATIONS ARE NECESSARY FOR

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:16.731
THIS.

01:22:16.798 --> 01:22:18.199
CERTAINLY LOCAL --

01:22:18.266 --> 01:22:20.201
LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS A VERY

01:22:20.268 --> 01:22:22.170
IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE LAND USE

01:22:22.237 --> 01:22:24.472
PLANNING BUT THE THE SUBDIVISION

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:26.441
AND MAP.

01:22:26.508 --> 01:22:29.978
DESIGN GUIDELINES GENERAL PLAY.

01:22:30.045 --> 01:22:31.546
DO THE GENERAL PLANS EXCEPT A

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:33.048
AND THE FORESTRY LAND MANAGEMENT

01:22:33.114 --> 01:22:34.749
AGENCIES UTILITIES WHO ARE --

01:22:34.816 --> 01:22:36.151
KIND OF AT OUT THERE IN THE

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:38.586
LARGER FOREST AREAS HAVE A ROLE.

01:22:38.653 --> 01:22:39.821
AND THEN THERE ARE THESE

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:42.424
BUILDING AND HARDENED HOMES AND

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:44.893
COMMUNITY RESILIENCY FEATURES

01:22:44.959 --> 01:22:45.193
[inaudible]

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:47.395
SO.

01:22:47.462 --> 01:22:48.630
WE'RE GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:22:48.697 --> 01:22:50.598
ABOUT ONE COMPONENT.

01:22:50.665 --> 01:22:52.434
ROBERT I'M GOING TO ADDRESS A

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.635
NUMBER OF THOSE FEATURES.

01:22:53.702 --> 01:22:56.604
HERE IN A MOMENT.

01:22:56.671 --> 01:22:58.807
SO IF YOU'RE PUTTING TOGETHER

01:22:58.873 --> 01:23:00.608
SOME KIND OF ACTION PLAN.

01:23:00.675 --> 01:23:02.043
AND AND YOU WERE LOOKING AT JUST

01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:03.778
WHAT ARE THOSE ELEMENTS THAT

01:23:03.845 --> 01:23:05.547
NEED IMPROVING RIGHT NOW. ONE OF

01:23:05.613 --> 01:23:07.482
THE CONCEPT IS.

01:23:07.549 --> 01:23:08.516
YOU NEED TO HAVE HARDENED

01:23:08.583 --> 01:23:10.185
COMMUNITY NEEDS MANY HARDENED

01:23:10.251 --> 01:23:13.154
HOMES SO RATHER THAN DOING A FEW

01:23:13.221 --> 01:23:15.290
HOMES IN A SCATTERED AREA YOU

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:17.225
NEED TO HAVE A FOCAL POINT.

01:23:17.292 --> 01:23:18.893
OF WHAT WAS THE TERM YOU USED A

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:21.496
SATURATION OF HARDENEDHOMES FOR

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:22.530
IT TO WORK IN A COMMUNITY

01:23:22.597 --> 01:23:23.631
OTHERWISE.

01:23:23.698 --> 01:23:25.200
YOU ARE LIKELY TO BE WASTING

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:27.035
YOUR TIME AND MONEY.

01:23:27.102 --> 01:23:29.170
SO YOU MUST PICK AREAS WHERE YOU

01:23:29.237 --> 01:23:31.539
CAN DO A LARGE SCALE CONVERSION

01:23:31.606 --> 01:23:32.707
OF HARDENED RETROFITTED

01:23:32.774 --> 01:23:34.509
STRUCTURES.

01:23:34.576 --> 01:23:35.076
ARE IN ORDER FOR THAT TO BE

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:35.977
EFFECTIVE.

01:23:36.044 --> 01:23:37.178
THE OTHER IS AN EDUCATIONAL IN

01:23:37.245 --> 01:23:41.116
SUPPORT OF OFFICIALS --

01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:42.817
YOU HEARD FROM AN EDUCATOR JUST

01:23:42.884 --> 01:23:44.919
A MOMENT AGO BUILDING OFFICIALS

01:23:44.986 --> 01:23:47.055
FIRE PREVENTION PERSONNEL DO NOT

01:23:47.122 --> 01:23:48.990
HAVE YET THE MATERIALS THAT

01:23:49.057 --> 01:23:50.492
EDUCATE THEM SPECIFICALLY ON

01:23:50.558 --> 01:23:51.860
THESE ISSUES SO I THINK WE NEED

01:23:51.926 --> 01:23:53.561
TO ENABLE THOSE COMMUNITIES WITH

01:23:53.628 --> 01:23:55.830
WITH CONSISTENT EDUCATIONAL

01:23:55.897 --> 01:23:57.665
GUIDELINES PROGRAM MATERIALS.

01:23:57.732 --> 01:23:58.633
AND HOW TO GET THAT MESSAGE OUT

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:00.869
THERE AT THE PROFESSIONAL LEVEL

01:24:00.935 --> 01:24:02.370
BEFORE THEY TRANSLATED TO THE

01:24:02.437 --> 01:24:04.472
HOMEOWNER LEVEL.

01:24:04.539 --> 01:24:05.707
INVESTING IN RETROFITTING

01:24:05.774 --> 01:24:07.208
DEFENSIBLE SPACE THAT'S THE CORE

01:24:07.275 --> 01:24:08.977
OF OUR CONVERSATION TODAY

01:24:09.043 --> 01:24:10.779
INVESTING IN RESEARCH CALIFORNIA

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:13.415
SPENDS AN ALARMINGLY LOAN AMOUNT

01:24:13.481 --> 01:24:15.517
OF FUNDS IN RESEARCHING THE

01:24:15.583 --> 01:24:17.452
MECHANISMS OF IGNITION AND

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:18.686
BUILDINGS.

01:24:18.753 --> 01:24:20.054
WE COULD DO BETTER WITH THAT.

01:24:20.121 --> 01:24:21.623
WE NEED OPERATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS

01:24:21.689 --> 01:24:23.358
BETWEEN STATE AND LOCALS AND

01:24:23.425 --> 01:24:24.559
THEN FINALLY WE NEED TO ASSESS

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:28.797
BOTH HAZARD AND RISK.

01:24:28.863 --> 01:24:35.003
SO WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT.

01:24:35.069 --> 01:24:36.037
WELL THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

01:24:36.104 --> 01:24:37.772
STATUTES IN AUTHORIZING

01:24:37.839 --> 01:24:40.008
PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE OF THE

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:41.643
ESTABLISHMENT A FIRE HAZARD

01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:43.812
SEVERITY ZONES I'M SURE YOU HAVE

01:24:43.878 --> 01:24:45.180
ALL SEEN THOSE MAPS.

01:24:45.246 --> 01:24:46.948
MANY OF THE LEGISLATION THE

01:24:47.015 --> 01:24:48.716
BUILDING CODES MANY THINGS ARE

01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:50.485
TIED TO THOSE FIRE HAZARD

01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:52.520
SEVERITIES ON MAPS AND AND I

01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:53.788
WILL.

01:24:53.855 --> 01:24:56.291
CALL OUT CAL FIRE DOES IN AN

01:24:56.357 --> 01:24:58.293
INCREDIBLE JOB THOSE ARE WORLD

01:24:58.359 --> 01:25:00.495
CLASS ASSESSMENTS OF FIRE HAZARD

01:25:00.562 --> 01:25:01.830
FOR CALIFORNIA.

01:25:01.896 --> 01:25:02.931
THEY DO.

01:25:02.997 --> 01:25:04.432
ABSOLUTELY WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED

01:25:04.499 --> 01:25:07.368
TO DO AND THAT IS IDENTIFY.

01:25:07.435 --> 01:25:10.004
THE PROBABILITY AND THE SEVERITY

01:25:10.071 --> 01:25:12.674
OF A FIRE OCCURRING IN A CERTAIN

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:14.108
PORTION OF THE LANDSCAPE.

01:25:14.175 --> 01:25:17.846
IT TEN THOSE MAPS TELL US WE'RE

01:25:17.912 --> 01:25:18.880
THE PROBLEM EXISTS.

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:19.848
THEY DO NOT TELL US WHAT TO DO

01:25:19.914 --> 01:25:21.649
ABOUT IT.

01:25:21.716 --> 01:25:23.151
THEY DO NOT MEASURE THE

01:25:23.218 --> 01:25:24.486
INVESTMENT THAT THEY WILL WE

01:25:24.552 --> 01:25:26.721
WILL BE MAKING FOR THAT HAZARD

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.490
SO I WANT TO READ JUST A SECTION

01:25:28.556 --> 01:25:29.924
AND THIS IS OUT OF THE FIRE

01:25:29.991 --> 01:25:32.193
HAZARD SEVERITY ZONE --

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:34.128
NONTECHNICAL GUIDELINE.

01:25:34.195 --> 01:25:35.597
BUT IT SAYS AS REQUIRED BY LAW

01:25:35.663 --> 01:25:38.333
THE MODEL THE FIRE HAZARD MODEL.

01:25:38.399 --> 01:25:40.535
EVALUATES HAZARD AND NOT RISK

01:25:40.602 --> 01:25:42.070
HAZARD REFERS TO PHYSICAL

01:25:42.136 --> 01:25:43.805
CONDITIONS THAT CAUSE DAMAGE AND

01:25:43.872 --> 01:25:45.306
HAZARDOUS CALCULATED IN OUR

01:25:45.373 --> 01:25:47.375
MODEL IS BASED ON THE PHYSICAL

01:25:47.442 --> 01:25:47.842
CONDITIONS THAT GIVE A

01:25:47.909 --> 01:25:48.877
LIKELIHOOD.

01:25:48.943 --> 01:25:50.245
ABOUT WHERE FIRE WILL BURN IN

01:25:50.311 --> 01:25:53.248
THE FUTURE WILL PRODUCE WHEN IT

01:25:53.314 --> 01:25:54.782
BURNS AND THE PRODUCTION OF THE

01:25:54.849 --> 01:25:56.751
AMBER SPREAD AND IT WAS GROUND

01:25:56.818 --> 01:25:58.920
CUTTING WORK THAT THEY DID IN

01:25:58.987 --> 01:25:59.654
TWO THOUSAND AND MID TWO

01:25:59.721 --> 01:26:00.355
THOUSANDS.

01:26:00.421 --> 01:26:01.823
IN TERMS OF PREDICTING WHERE

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:03.458
EMBER EXPOSURE WILL OCCUR IN

01:26:03.525 --> 01:26:05.994
COMMUNITIES.

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:07.328
IT IS BASED ON THE POTENTIAL

01:26:07.395 --> 01:26:08.496
VEGETATION THAT WILL GROW IN THE

01:26:08.563 --> 01:26:10.598
AREA OVER THE NEXT THIRTY TO

01:26:10.665 --> 01:26:12.634
FIFTY YEARS VERY APPROPRIATE.

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:14.536
RISK ON THE OTHER HAND IS THE

01:26:14.602 --> 01:26:17.171
POTENTIAL DAMAGE OF FIRE CAN DO

01:26:17.238 --> 01:26:18.773
TO THE VALUES AT RISK IN THAT

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.542
AREA UNDER EXISTING AND FUTURE

01:26:20.608 --> 01:26:21.442
CONDITIONS.

01:26:21.509 --> 01:26:23.778
RISK DOES CONSIDER MODIFICATIONS

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:25.113
THAT AFFECT THE SUSCEPTIBILITY

01:26:25.179 --> 01:26:26.648
OF PROPERTY DAMAGE.

01:26:26.714 --> 01:26:28.917
RISK INCLUDES DEFENSIBLE SPACE

01:26:28.983 --> 01:26:30.351
IRRIGATION SPRINKLERS AND

01:26:30.418 --> 01:26:31.419
BUILDING CONSTRUCTION THAT

01:26:31.486 --> 01:26:33.254
REDUCE THE RISK OF BURNING

01:26:33.321 --> 01:26:34.889
EMBERS IGNITING THE BUILDING.

01:26:34.956 --> 01:26:36.758
HAZARD DOES NOT EQUAL RISK BUT

01:26:36.824 --> 01:26:38.259
IT IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN

01:26:38.326 --> 01:26:39.460
DETERMINING RISK.

01:26:39.527 --> 01:26:41.029
SO THE REASON I'M MAKING A POINT

01:26:41.095 --> 01:26:42.564
ABOUT THIS TODAY IS THE

01:26:42.630 --> 01:26:45.667
INSURANCE COMPANY EVALUATES RISK.

01:26:45.733 --> 01:26:47.302
WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING

01:26:47.368 --> 01:26:49.103
HAZARD AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT.

01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:50.405
AND I THINK WE CAN HAVE A

01:26:50.471 --> 01:26:52.574
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO MOVE

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.776
FORWARD BECAUSE CALIFORNIA NOW

01:26:54.842 --> 01:26:55.710
HAS.

01:26:55.777 --> 01:26:58.379
A MORE ROBUST CAPABILITY TO DO

01:26:58.446 --> 01:27:00.548
THAT TYPE OF EVALUATION CAL FIRE

01:27:00.615 --> 01:27:02.116
IS AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO

01:27:02.183 --> 01:27:03.384
CONSIDER DOING THAT LOCAL

01:27:03.451 --> 01:27:05.420
GOVERNMENT LOCAL FIRE SERVICE

01:27:05.486 --> 01:27:07.355
EXPERTS THE TECHNOLOGY IS

01:27:07.422 --> 01:27:09.324
AVAILABLE THERE ARE MANY THINGS

01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:10.792
THAT WEREN'T TEN YEARS AGO.

01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:11.960
THAT MIGHT MAKE THAT POSSIBLE

01:27:12.026 --> 01:27:13.294
TODAY AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN

01:27:13.361 --> 01:27:14.562
EXAMPLE OF A COMMUNITY THAT HAS

01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:16.598
BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIFTEEN

01:27:16.664 --> 01:27:17.732
YEARS.

01:27:17.799 --> 01:27:19.033
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE FROM COLORADO

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:21.202
SPRINGS COLORADO THAT IS THEIR

01:27:21.269 --> 01:27:23.004
FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONE THAT

01:27:23.071 --> 01:27:24.105
THEY DO IN A MODELING PROCESS

01:27:24.172 --> 01:27:25.840
SIMILAR TO CAL FIRES AND WHAT

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:27.108
THEIR MAP LOOKS LIKE WITHIN

01:27:27.175 --> 01:27:28.876
THEIR CITY BOUNDARIES.

01:27:28.943 --> 01:27:30.445
SHOULD LOOK VERY FAMILIAR TO US

01:27:30.511 --> 01:27:31.913
THOSE ARE THE RED ZONES THAT WE

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:34.215
WORRY ABOUT AND ARE HIGH IN VERY

01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:37.285
HIGH FIRE HAZARD AREAS.

01:27:37.352 --> 01:27:38.152
THEY TOOK IT A STEP FURTHER

01:27:38.219 --> 01:27:39.854
THOUGH THEY TOOK IT DOWN TO THE

01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:41.222
STRUCTURE LEVEL.

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:43.224
AND THEY STARTED TO SAY WELL WE

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:44.325
KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE

01:27:44.392 --> 01:27:46.027
LIVING IN THESE AREAS SO WHAT

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:48.730
CAN WE INVEST IN AS A HOMEOWNER.

01:27:48.796 --> 01:27:50.431
AS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS A STATE

01:27:50.498 --> 01:27:54.135
OR FOR EDUCATION PARTNER WHAT

01:27:54.202 --> 01:27:55.703
CAN WE INVEST IN AND HOW DO WE

01:27:55.770 --> 01:27:57.171
MAKE THIS LOOK LIKE WHAT THE

01:27:57.238 --> 01:27:58.840
INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS DOING TO

01:27:58.906 --> 01:28:00.642
ASSESS OUR STRUCTURES.

01:28:00.708 --> 01:28:01.209
SO THEY WENT THROUGH A RISK

01:28:01.275 --> 01:28:02.944
ASSESSMENT.

01:28:03.011 --> 01:28:05.113
SO OVER LATE IN THAT SAME AREA

01:28:05.179 --> 01:28:07.482
THOSE ARE THE PARCELS THAT LIES

01:28:07.548 --> 01:28:09.017
UNDERNEATH THOSE FIRE HAZARD

01:28:09.083 --> 01:28:09.817
JONES.

01:28:09.884 --> 01:28:11.085
THEY WENT DOWN AND THEY SAID

01:28:11.152 --> 01:28:12.286
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS

01:28:12.353 --> 01:28:13.721
ABOUT EACH STRUCTURE THAT WE

01:28:13.788 --> 01:28:14.956
KNOW ARE IMPORTANT LIKE

01:28:15.023 --> 01:28:16.724
DEFENSIBLE SPACE.

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:18.993
LIGHT BUILDING FEATURES ETCETERA

01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:20.561
ETCETERA WHAT IS THE FIRE JUST

01:28:20.628 --> 01:28:22.096
DEPARTMENT RESPONSE CAPABILITY

01:28:22.163 --> 01:28:23.831
IN THAT AREA AND THEY WENT OUT

01:28:23.898 --> 01:28:25.733
AND THEY CREATED AN ABILITY TO

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.669
INTERACT WITH THE HOMEOWNER AND

01:28:27.735 --> 01:28:29.404
ASSESS THAT IF THE PARCEL LEVEL.

01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:30.938
SO FOR FIFTEEN YEARS THEY HAVE

01:28:31.005 --> 01:28:34.208
BEEN ON A PATH OF REDUCING RISK.

01:28:34.275 --> 01:28:36.611
UNDERNEATH THEIR SEVERE FIRE

01:28:36.678 --> 01:28:38.279
HAZARDS.

01:28:38.346 --> 01:28:40.181
AND CORRELATING THAT TO THEIR

01:28:40.248 --> 01:28:42.283
INSURANCE THEY ALSO HAVE A TAX

01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:43.951
MITIGATION OF PROGRAM FOR

01:28:44.018 --> 01:28:46.721
REIMBURSEMENT TO HOMEOWNERS TO

01:28:46.788 --> 01:28:48.923
HELP INCENTIVIZE THAT.

01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:50.024
AND I BELIEVE THAT'S MY LAST

01:28:50.091 --> 01:28:50.358
SLIDE IT IS.

01:28:50.425 --> 01:28:53.127
AND WHAT THAT DOES IS IT STARTS

01:28:53.194 --> 01:28:55.496
TO ALIGN THE TWO KEY FINANCIAL

01:28:55.563 --> 01:28:57.999
ISSUES WHICH IS DISASTER EXPENSE

01:28:58.066 --> 01:28:59.600
AND INSURANCE COSTS TRIED IT

01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:01.002
START TO ALIGN THEM TOWARD THE

01:29:01.069 --> 01:29:02.403
SAME SET OF GOALS.

01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:05.173
AND MOREOVER THIS IS A THIS IS

01:29:05.239 --> 01:29:06.841
ONE OF THE WAYS BY WHICH YOU CAN

01:29:06.908 --> 01:29:09.477
START TO NOW BUILD CONSISTENCY

01:29:09.544 --> 01:29:11.245
ACROSS THE STATE.

01:29:11.312 --> 01:29:13.347
A SINGLE RISK MODEL DEVELOPED BY

01:29:13.414 --> 01:29:14.615
THE EXPERTS THAT KNOW HOW TO DO

01:29:14.682 --> 01:29:16.617
THAT PARTNERED WITH BY LOCAL

01:29:16.684 --> 01:29:18.219
GOVERNMENT BUT WE CAN TAKE A

01:29:18.286 --> 01:29:20.388
LOOK AT HOW ARE INVESTMENTS

01:29:20.455 --> 01:29:21.723
COLLECTIVELY ARE MAKING A

01:29:21.789 --> 01:29:23.891
DIFFERENCE TEN YEARS FROM NOW WE

01:29:23.958 --> 01:29:24.659
CAN LOOK AT A VERY DIFFERENT MAP

01:29:24.726 --> 01:29:26.828
OF CALIFORNIA. ONE THAT SHOWS

01:29:26.894 --> 01:29:28.529
WHERE WE ARE LIVING IN A MUCH

01:29:28.596 --> 01:29:30.398
SAFER WAY.

01:29:30.465 --> 01:29:31.966
OTHERWISE WE'LL BE MARRIED TO

01:29:32.033 --> 01:29:35.403
JUST A HAS WHERE THE PROBLEM IS

01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:36.370
BUT NOT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO

01:29:36.437 --> 01:29:36.604
FIX IT.

01:29:36.671 --> 01:29:40.174
THANK YOU.

01:29:40.241 --> 01:29:41.242
I THANK YOU --

01:29:41.309 --> 01:29:43.644
THOSE WERE TWO EXTREMELY

01:29:43.711 --> 01:29:45.046
INTERESTING PRESENTATION AND

01:29:45.113 --> 01:29:46.280
THAT PRESENTATIONS AND I'VE

01:29:46.347 --> 01:29:47.615
REALLY BEEN --

01:29:47.682 --> 01:29:49.817
VERY HELPFUL TO ME AS I'VE BEEN

01:29:49.884 --> 01:29:51.586
THINKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES --

01:29:51.652 --> 01:29:54.956
I HAVE INTRODUCED A BILL AB

01:29:55.022 --> 01:29:55.590
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THAT DEALS WITH

01:29:55.656 --> 01:29:57.759
THE FIVE FOOT DISPENSED.

01:29:57.825 --> 01:29:59.093
DEFENSIBLE SPACE.

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.328
ISSUE IN TRYING TO CLARIFY THAT

01:30:00.394 --> 01:30:01.829
AND AND TURN THAT INTO A

01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:03.231
REQUIREMENT ON IN OUR FIRE

01:30:03.297 --> 01:30:04.966
SEVERITY ZONE SO I LOOK FORWARD

01:30:05.032 --> 01:30:06.534
TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT --

01:30:06.601 --> 01:30:08.836
AND THE TOOLS THAT YOU WERE

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:11.639
TALKING ABOUT TO TRY TO HELP.

01:30:11.706 --> 01:30:13.407
INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS AND

01:30:13.474 --> 01:30:13.941
PROPERTY OWNERS WITH HOME

01:30:14.008 --> 01:30:14.976
HARDENING.

01:30:15.042 --> 01:30:16.644
IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:17.945
SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW I'VE

01:30:18.012 --> 01:30:19.947
BEEN GRAPPLING WITH HIS --

01:30:20.014 --> 01:30:21.382
PARTICULARLY IN IN A LOT OF OUR

01:30:21.449 --> 01:30:22.917
URBAN AREAS WITH THE HOMES ARE

01:30:22.984 --> 01:30:24.385
VERY CLOSE TOGETHER THAT YOU'RE

01:30:24.452 --> 01:30:24.886
NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DO

01:30:24.952 --> 01:30:26.454
MEANINGFUL LARGE DEFENSIBLE

01:30:26.521 --> 01:30:28.723
SPACE --

01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:30.057
WORK YOU'VE GOT HUNDREDS OF

01:30:30.124 --> 01:30:31.659
THOUSANDS OF HOMES IN THESE

01:30:31.726 --> 01:30:33.327
AREAS ARE MILLIONS OF HOMES IN

01:30:33.394 --> 01:30:34.262
THESE AREAS.

01:30:34.328 --> 01:30:35.596
SO HOW.

01:30:35.663 --> 01:30:37.165
TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THE

01:30:37.231 --> 01:30:40.368
HARDENING SIT IN.

01:30:40.434 --> 01:30:41.836
WHAT YOU WERE MENTIONING ABOUT

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:43.037
SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS IN

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:44.672
COLORADO SO I'M GOING TO ASK

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:46.240
HALF TO SORT OF DRILL DOWN FOR

01:30:46.307 --> 01:30:47.909
ME INTO THAT SO THAT I CAN SEE

01:30:47.975 --> 01:30:50.178
IF THERE'S ANY --

01:30:50.244 --> 01:30:51.646
TOOLS THERE THAT WE HAVEN'T

01:30:51.712 --> 01:30:53.447
EXPLORED IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE

01:30:53.514 --> 01:30:55.216
MIGHT BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW BRING

01:30:55.283 --> 01:30:57.251
ONLINE BECAUSE THAT WAS YOU KNOW

01:30:57.318 --> 01:30:58.452
REALLY REALLY INTERESTING TO

01:30:58.519 --> 01:30:59.253
HEAR WHAT THEY'VE BEEN WORKING

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:00.855
ON AND I YOU KNOW I HAVE BEEN

01:31:00.922 --> 01:31:02.256
VERY WORRIED ABOUT.

01:31:02.323 --> 01:31:03.324
WHAT HAD WHAT'S HAPPENING IN A

01:31:03.391 --> 01:31:04.458
LOT OF THESE AREAS WITH

01:31:04.525 --> 01:31:06.127
INSURANCE COMPANIES --

01:31:06.194 --> 01:31:07.595
BECAUSE THEY GO BY ZIP CODE

01:31:07.662 --> 01:31:08.863
REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE'RE PEOPLE

01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:09.330
MAY HAVE DONE ON THEIR

01:31:09.397 --> 01:31:11.199
INDIVIDUAL HOMES AND WHAT THEIR

01:31:11.265 --> 01:31:12.667
INDIVIDUAL RISK IS AND THEY

01:31:12.733 --> 01:31:14.535
CANCEL WIDE SWATHS OF PEOPLE'S

01:31:14.602 --> 01:31:15.937
INSURANCE WHICH IS.

01:31:16.003 --> 01:31:17.738
A REALLY NEGATIVE RESULT FOR

01:31:17.805 --> 01:31:19.073
THOSE COMMUNITIES IN THOSE THOSE

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:20.074
HOMEOWNERS.

01:31:20.141 --> 01:31:21.275
SO IF THERE'S ANYBODY HERE FROM

01:31:21.342 --> 01:31:22.476
THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN THE

01:31:22.543 --> 01:31:23.811
ROOM ARE LISTENING I DO HOPE

01:31:23.878 --> 01:31:24.712
THAT YOU KNOW.

01:31:24.779 --> 01:31:25.646
THE THAT INDUSTRY IS WILLING TO

01:31:25.713 --> 01:31:27.481
SIT DOWN AND YOU KNOW WORK WITH

01:31:27.548 --> 01:31:29.684
US TO NOT ONLY MITIGATE THEIR

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:31.385
OWN RISK AS UNDERWRITERS WITH TO

01:31:31.452 --> 01:31:33.654
HELPBRING POLICIES ONLINE THAT

01:31:33.721 --> 01:31:36.557
ENCOURAGE HOMEOWNERS. TO INVEST

01:31:36.624 --> 01:31:37.892
IN THIS WORK WITH THE PROMISE OF

01:31:37.959 --> 01:31:39.293
HAVING COVERAGE FROM INSURANCE

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:40.728
COMPANIES AT THE END OF IT AND

01:31:40.795 --> 01:31:42.129
MAYBE EVEN REDUCE PREMIUMS AT

01:31:42.196 --> 01:31:43.130
THE END OF IT --

01:31:43.197 --> 01:31:45.132
BUT WITHOUT THAT PIECE I I FEEL

01:31:45.199 --> 01:31:46.767
LIKE THIS IS NEVER GOING TO WORK --

01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:50.137
FINANCIALLY FOR HOMEOWNERS --

01:31:50.204 --> 01:31:53.608
I THESE ARE YOU KNOW THAT IS

01:31:53.674 --> 01:31:57.245
WELL IN MENTION THAT WE HAVE TO

01:31:57.311 --> 01:31:58.479
MEMBERS WHO HAVE JUST JOINED US

01:31:58.546 --> 01:32:00.815
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA.

01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:02.250
ASSEMBLY MEMBER DEVON MATHIS OF

01:32:02.316 --> 01:32:03.784
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FOR

01:32:03.851 --> 01:32:05.887
BEING HERE WITH US.

01:32:05.953 --> 01:32:07.488
STUFF ONE RIGHT NOW.

01:32:07.555 --> 01:32:08.122
THAT'S TOTALLY FINE OTHER OTHER

01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:09.657
COMMITTEE MEETINGS THAT ARE

01:32:09.724 --> 01:32:11.492
GOING ON I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF

01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:12.827
QUESTIONS --

01:32:12.894 --> 01:32:13.995
THERE ARE --

01:32:14.061 --> 01:32:15.396
HOMES THAT CERTAINLY THAT HAVE

01:32:15.463 --> 01:32:16.864
ADOPTED A LOT OF THESE

01:32:16.931 --> 01:32:18.266
REQUIREMENTS A LOT OF THE

01:32:18.332 --> 01:32:20.067
SUGGESTIONS WITH --

01:32:20.134 --> 01:32:21.202
HOME HARDENING INDEFENSIBLE

01:32:21.269 --> 01:32:22.436
FACING THAT THEY STILL BURNED

01:32:22.503 --> 01:32:24.205
DOWN AND WHAT AND FOUGHT WELFARE

01:32:24.272 --> 01:32:25.273
IS THERE SOMETHING THAT WERE

01:32:25.339 --> 01:32:26.507
MISSING THAT'S NOT IN ANY OF

01:32:26.574 --> 01:32:27.541
THESE ARE KIND OF WHAT WHAT

01:32:27.608 --> 01:32:29.110
HAPPENS IN THOSE CASES OF THE

01:32:29.176 --> 01:32:30.678
FIRE SO EXTREME THERE'S REALLY

01:32:30.745 --> 01:32:32.346
NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE OR DO

01:32:32.413 --> 01:32:32.613
YOU HAVE.

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:33.714
ANYOTHER.

01:32:33.781 --> 01:32:35.016
THE IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE WE

01:32:35.082 --> 01:32:35.950
SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT.

01:32:36.017 --> 01:32:38.185
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION THANK

01:32:38.252 --> 01:32:39.620
YOU FOR A FIRST ASKING AT I'M

01:32:39.687 --> 01:32:41.188
CURIOUS WHAT JAY IS GOING TO

01:32:41.255 --> 01:32:41.722
HAVE TO SAY FROM SOUTHERN

01:32:41.789 --> 01:32:42.723
CALIFORNIA --

01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:43.891
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:32:43.958 --> 01:32:45.359
HAPPENED IN PARADISE AND

01:32:45.426 --> 01:32:46.394
PARADISE IS ONE OF THE BETTER

01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:48.262
ILLUSTRATIONS MOST OF THE HOMES

01:32:48.329 --> 01:32:49.730
THAT WERE BUILT IN THE SANTA

01:32:49.797 --> 01:32:52.166
ROSA AREA WERE BUILT PRIOR TO

01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:53.000
THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT

01:32:53.067 --> 01:32:54.235
CHANGING CODE SO THERE'S NOT A

01:32:54.302 --> 01:32:55.369
LOT TO LEARN FROM HOW THE NEW.

01:32:55.436 --> 01:32:57.104
CODE TO PERFORMING THERE THERE

01:32:57.171 --> 01:32:58.806
ARE SOME AND IN READING --

01:32:58.873 --> 01:33:00.675
AS I SAID OF THE HUNDRED OR SO

01:33:00.741 --> 01:33:01.509
HOMES THAT WERE BUILT IN

01:33:01.575 --> 01:33:03.077
PARADISE TWENTY FIVE OF THEM

01:33:03.144 --> 01:33:04.345
SURVIVED SO.

01:33:04.412 --> 01:33:06.714
NOT A GREAT ODD --

01:33:06.781 --> 01:33:09.884
BUT THE QUESTION ONE DISCRETE

01:33:09.951 --> 01:33:11.519
NEIGHBORHOOD THEY'RE DISPERSED

01:33:11.585 --> 01:33:13.321
AND SO -- MY

01:33:13.387 --> 01:33:15.156
HUNCH AND WERE WERE TRYING TO

01:33:15.222 --> 01:33:16.157
GET INTO THE DATA AND FIGURE

01:33:16.223 --> 01:33:17.725
THIS OUT IS THAT THEY PROBABLY

01:33:17.792 --> 01:33:19.293
HAD REDUCE SET BACKS AND SAID

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.428
THEY WERE INFILL.

01:33:20.494 --> 01:33:21.896
MEANING THAT THERE ARE CLOSER

01:33:21.963 --> 01:33:24.098
HOMES TO THEM SO THE CONDITION

01:33:24.165 --> 01:33:25.032
OF YOUR NEIGHBOR'S HOME CAN

01:33:25.099 --> 01:33:27.268
OVERWHELM YOUR HOME IF IT'S NOT

01:33:27.335 --> 01:33:28.602
UP TO PAR --

01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:30.371
SO YOU CAN YOU CAN HAVE SOME YOU

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:32.306
KNOW AMELIORATING A FAX OF THE

01:33:32.373 --> 01:33:33.174
SURROUNDING CONDITION THAT COULD

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:35.042
MAKE A MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON YOUR

01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:37.678
OWN HOME SURVIVAL --

01:33:37.745 --> 01:33:39.380
YOU KNOW THE THE QUESTION IS YOU

01:33:39.447 --> 01:33:40.614
KNOW IS IT ARE THESE RETROFITS

01:33:40.681 --> 01:33:42.083
EXPENSIVE ARE THESE BUILDING

01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:43.684
CODES EXPENSIVE --

01:33:43.751 --> 01:33:44.285
YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE STARTING A

01:33:44.352 --> 01:33:45.653
NEW CONSTRUCTION IS ABOUT A 5%

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:47.321
ADDITION OTHERS A NEW RESEARCH

01:33:47.388 --> 01:33:48.622
REPORT THAT CAME OUT WITH FROM

01:33:48.689 --> 01:33:50.424
HEADWATERS ECONOMICS THAT SAID

01:33:50.491 --> 01:33:51.158
YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE STARTING A

01:33:51.225 --> 01:33:52.493
NEW CONSTRUCTION THE MEETING

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:53.327
THESE CODE STANDARDS IS NOT

01:33:53.394 --> 01:33:54.795
REALLY A HUGE.

01:33:54.862 --> 01:33:56.764
HUGE A BURDEN TO BEAR IF YOU'RE

01:33:56.831 --> 01:33:57.965
DEALING WITH RETROFITS WERE YOUR

01:33:58.032 --> 01:34:00.267
HOW YOUR ROOF IS IN BAD SHAPE

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:00.935
THAT OF COURSE IT'S MORE

01:34:01.002 --> 01:34:02.236
EXPENSIVE --

01:34:02.303 --> 01:34:03.537
PROPORTIONATELY BUT IF IT'S YOU

01:34:03.604 --> 01:34:05.039
JUST DEALING WITH VENTS AND

01:34:05.106 --> 01:34:06.607
OTHER SMALL DETAILS --

01:34:06.674 --> 01:34:08.609
THEY'RE NOT OVERLY EXPENSIVE BUT

01:34:08.676 --> 01:34:10.177
IN THOSE SITUATIONS YOU HAVE TO

01:34:10.244 --> 01:34:10.811
UNDERSTAND WHETHER YOU'RE GOING

01:34:10.878 --> 01:34:12.346
TO BE HAVING DIRECT FLAME

01:34:12.413 --> 01:34:13.781
EXPOSURE OR WHETHER GONNA BE

01:34:13.848 --> 01:34:14.882
HAVING EMBERS OR SOME

01:34:14.949 --> 01:34:16.917
COMBINATION OF THE TWO AND SO%

01:34:16.984 --> 01:34:17.952
YOU KNOW.

01:34:18.019 --> 01:34:19.854
THERE'S SOME NEW WANTS TO THIS --

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:21.188
AND SO I THINK THAT THE

01:34:21.255 --> 01:34:22.656
CHALLENGES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:34:22.723 --> 01:34:24.125
WHERE THOSE HOMES ARE AND HOW

01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:25.526
THEY'RE SITUATED IN WHAT THEY'RE

01:34:25.593 --> 01:34:26.994
LIKELY TO FOR WHAT KIND OF

01:34:27.061 --> 01:34:28.729
EXPOSURE THEY'RE LIKELY TO FACE.

01:34:28.796 --> 01:34:30.631
SO AGAIN IF YOUR NEIGHBOR'S HOME

01:34:30.698 --> 01:34:32.266
IS IN POOR SHAPE IT'S LIKELY TO

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:33.934
CATCH ON FIRE AND THEN BECAUSE A

01:34:34.001 --> 01:34:39.173
LOT OF OF RADIANT HEAT EXPOSURE.

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:43.110
CATCHES ON FIRE NEW ONES.

01:34:43.177 --> 01:34:43.611
IF YOU'RE AN INDIVIDUAL

01:34:43.677 --> 01:34:46.180
HOMEOWNER WHERE DO YOU FIND.

01:34:46.247 --> 01:34:49.450
INFORMATION ABOUT IF YOU HAD.

01:34:49.517 --> 01:34:51.218
SO MONEY INVESTED BUT WE'RE THE

01:34:51.285 --> 01:34:53.654
BEST PLACE WOULD BE TO INVEST

01:34:53.721 --> 01:34:54.288
THAT TO HEART IN YOUR OWN HOME

01:34:54.355 --> 01:34:55.723
IS THERE. TO LOCAL FIRE

01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:57.258
DEPARTMENTS COME OUT AND HELP

01:34:57.324 --> 01:34:58.793
PEOPLE WITH THAT IS THERE SOME.

01:34:58.859 --> 01:35:00.294
AMAZING WEBSITE THAT TELLS

01:35:00.361 --> 01:35:01.829
PEOPLE YOU WANT TO BUY THIS KIND

01:35:01.896 --> 01:35:02.430
OF SCREEN FOR THIS KIND OF

01:35:02.496 --> 01:35:03.931
SUBJECT HOW WOULD PEOPLE EVEN

01:35:03.998 --> 01:35:05.800
BEGIN TO HARD IN THEIR OWN HOMES

01:35:05.866 --> 01:35:07.168
OR TO FIND THAT INFORMATION ALL

01:35:07.234 --> 01:35:08.803
TO START WITHIN THE OFFICE OF

01:35:08.869 --> 01:35:10.604
THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL HAS.

01:35:10.671 --> 01:35:11.872
THE POSTINGS AS TO WHAT THE

01:35:11.939 --> 01:35:13.541
APPROVED MATERIALS ARE.

01:35:13.607 --> 01:35:15.109
THE BEST WEBSITE AT THIS POINT

01:35:15.176 --> 01:35:16.377
IS REALLY THE INSURANCE BUSINESS

01:35:16.444 --> 01:35:17.845
SUIT FOR BUSINESS AND HOME

01:35:17.912 --> 01:35:19.447
SAFETY --

01:35:19.513 --> 01:35:21.115
WHICH HAS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE

01:35:21.182 --> 01:35:23.084
MATERIALS THERE THE UNIVERSITY

01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:24.518
CALIFORNIA WERE PRETTY THIN

01:35:24.585 --> 01:35:25.820
STAFFED IN THIS AREA BUT WE'RE

01:35:25.886 --> 01:35:28.489
TRYING TO MODIFY A AND BUILD NEW

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:29.957
WEBSITES A NEW MATERIALS TO BE

01:35:30.024 --> 01:35:31.258
ABLE TO BRING THAT UP TO SPEED

01:35:31.325 --> 01:35:33.160
WE'VE GOT MATERIALS BUT THERE.

01:35:33.227 --> 01:35:35.329
BUT THEIR JUST NEEDS MORE WORK

01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:36.363
AND INVESTMENT ON IT I DON'T

01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:37.198
THERE'S OTHER SOURCES YOU WANT

01:35:37.264 --> 01:35:38.699
TO BRING INTO NOT.

01:35:38.766 --> 01:35:39.667
SHE MENTIONED THE TWO BEST

01:35:39.733 --> 01:35:40.534
SOURCES THAT ARE OUT THERE THE

01:35:40.601 --> 01:35:42.103
STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE DOES

01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:44.205
HAVE MATERIALS THAT ARE I'D.

01:35:44.271 --> 01:35:47.341
A GENERAL AND GUIDELINES AND

01:35:47.408 --> 01:35:50.344
THEN THE INSTITUTE SAFE ENOUGH

01:35:50.411 --> 01:35:51.745
THAT BUSINESS AND HOME SAFETY

01:35:51.812 --> 01:35:52.413
ARE HAS --

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:54.348
HOMEOWNER ORIENTED MATERIALS BUT

01:35:54.415 --> 01:35:56.717
THOSE ARE NOT WIDELY.

01:35:56.784 --> 01:35:59.787
KNOWN WEBSITES --

01:35:59.854 --> 01:36:01.655
BUT I DO WANT TO GO BACK TO YOUR

01:36:01.722 --> 01:36:02.890
QUESTION --

01:36:02.957 --> 01:36:07.061
CHAIR AND AND JUST SPEAK UP FOR

01:36:07.128 --> 01:36:07.995
THIS PARTICULAR CONCERN.

01:36:08.062 --> 01:36:10.231
AND THAT IS.

01:36:10.297 --> 01:36:12.399
I COULD ASK RHETORICALLY IF

01:36:12.466 --> 01:36:13.400
ANYONE KNOWS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:36:13.467 --> 01:36:14.802
THAT CALIFORNIA HAS SPENT ON

01:36:14.869 --> 01:36:17.338
RESEARCHING BUILDING IGNITION

01:36:17.404 --> 01:36:19.206
LOSS OR BUILDING LOSS IN

01:36:19.273 --> 01:36:20.708
WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE FIRES.

01:36:20.774 --> 01:36:22.510
AND IF ANY OF YOU SAID I DON'T

01:36:22.576 --> 01:36:25.279
KNOW I WOULD COME BACK AND SAY

01:36:25.346 --> 01:36:26.313
ZERO IS IN TERMS OF WHAT I AM

01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:27.815
AWARE OF AS A STATE.

01:36:27.882 --> 01:36:30.151
WE HAVE NOT INVESTED AS A LINE

01:36:30.217 --> 01:36:32.419
ITEM BUDGET RESEARCH WE HAVE NOT

01:36:32.486 --> 01:36:34.321
FUNDED OUR ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS

01:36:34.388 --> 01:36:36.290
WE DO NOT HAVE A RESEARCH CENTER

01:36:36.357 --> 01:36:37.625
IN THIS STATE A CENTER OF

01:36:37.691 --> 01:36:39.326
EXCELLENCE FOR THIS ISSUE.

01:36:39.393 --> 01:36:41.629
WE DO NOT INVEST A SYSTEMIC

01:36:41.695 --> 01:36:43.797
RESEARCH PROGRAM FOR THIS

01:36:43.864 --> 01:36:46.000
PARTICULAR HAZARD AND I WOULD.

01:36:46.066 --> 01:36:47.668
SUGGEST THAT THAT IT'S TIME WE

01:36:47.735 --> 01:36:49.236
DID.

01:36:49.303 --> 01:36:50.171
THANK YOU THAT'S A EXCELLENT

01:36:50.237 --> 01:36:50.938
POINT.

01:36:51.005 --> 01:36:53.974
IN TERMS OF THE THE FIVE FOOT OF

01:36:54.041 --> 01:36:55.009
DEFENSIBLE SPACE --

01:36:55.075 --> 01:36:56.277
AS YOU SAID THIS IS SOMETHING

01:36:56.343 --> 01:36:57.945
THAT HOMEOWNERS PROPERTY OWNERS

01:36:58.012 --> 01:36:59.480
ARE VERY RELUCTANT TO DOPEOPLE

01:36:59.547 --> 01:37:01.782
LOVE THEIR GREEN SPACE PEOPLE

01:37:01.849 --> 01:37:03.584
WANT THE COOLING --

01:37:03.651 --> 01:37:04.185
QUALITIES OF IT THEY WANT THE

01:37:04.251 --> 01:37:07.621
BUTTE AIR QUALITY --

01:37:07.688 --> 01:37:08.923
THAT IT BRINGS --

01:37:08.989 --> 01:37:11.225
AND YOU KNOW AS I TALKED ABOUT

01:37:11.292 --> 01:37:12.026
THE BILL THAT I'M INTRODUCING

01:37:12.092 --> 01:37:13.227
YOU KNOW I SAY TO MYSELF YOU

01:37:13.294 --> 01:37:14.028
KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA BE GOING

01:37:14.094 --> 01:37:15.462
OUT AND TELLING PEOPLE TO CUT

01:37:15.529 --> 01:37:16.197
THEIR REPEAL GRANDMA'S ROSES

01:37:16.263 --> 01:37:17.198
DOWN.

01:37:17.264 --> 01:37:18.666
AND THIS IS GOING TO BE TOUGH.

01:37:18.732 --> 01:37:20.467
ARE THEIR PLANT MATERIALS THAT

01:37:20.534 --> 01:37:22.469
CAN BE PLANTED IN THAT FIVE FEET

01:37:22.536 --> 01:37:24.338
OR EVEN AGAINST A HOME.

01:37:24.405 --> 01:37:28.576
THAT ARE OKAY MEAN A COULD A

01:37:28.642 --> 01:37:29.843
SUCCULENT BE OKAY OR IS IT ANY

01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:31.579
FOLIAGE IS JUST GOING TO BE BAD

01:37:31.645 --> 01:37:32.446
AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S A SCALE

01:37:32.513 --> 01:37:34.815
BUT BUT IT'S AN IT'S AN

01:37:34.882 --> 01:37:36.584
INTERESTING QUESTION --

01:37:36.650 --> 01:37:37.551
I TALK ABOUT RIGHT PLANT RIGHT

01:37:37.618 --> 01:37:39.186
PLACE -- AND

01:37:39.253 --> 01:37:40.554
YOU KNOW REALLY ANY PLANT WILL

01:37:40.621 --> 01:37:42.223
BURN UNDER THE RIGHT CONDITIONS --

01:37:42.289 --> 01:37:44.191
SO YOU KNOW UNDERSTANDING THE

01:37:44.258 --> 01:37:45.359
NATURE OF THE CHARACTERISTIC OF

01:37:45.426 --> 01:37:47.228
THE KIND OF PLANT YOU YOU WANT A

01:37:47.294 --> 01:37:48.929
PLAN WHERE YOU WANT TO PLANET --

01:37:48.996 --> 01:37:49.730
I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE A

01:37:49.797 --> 01:37:50.598
FRIEND WHO'S A LANDSCAPE

01:37:50.664 --> 01:37:51.832
CONTRACTOR WE'RE TRYING TO COME

01:37:51.899 --> 01:37:53.234
UP WITH SOME NICE NEW VISUALS TO

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.935
HELP ILLUSTRATE THIS SO THAT

01:37:55.002 --> 01:37:57.037
IT'S NOT SO --

01:37:57.104 --> 01:37:59.540
A DAUNTING YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY

01:37:59.607 --> 01:38:01.208
IS A MORE THE PLANTINGS ARE YOU

01:38:01.275 --> 01:38:02.209
RIGHT NOW THE PLANTE'S GO UP

01:38:02.276 --> 01:38:03.510
AGAINST THE HOUSE THE WALKWAY

01:38:03.577 --> 01:38:04.712
GOES ON THE OUTSIDE OF THAT WILL

01:38:04.778 --> 01:38:05.713
IF YOU SWITCH IT --

01:38:05.779 --> 01:38:07.615
YOU CAN YOU CAN ACHIEVE A LOT IN

01:38:07.681 --> 01:38:09.049

BULLET OF A PLANT THAT IS GOING

01:38:13.153 --> 01:38:14.855
TO GET YOU THROUGH --

01:38:14.922 --> 01:38:15.756
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO TAKE

01:38:15.823 --> 01:38:17.825
MAINTENANCE SO WHAT I FIND IS A

01:38:17.891 --> 01:38:19.159
PEOPLE ARE RELUCTANT ONCE THEY

01:38:19.226 --> 01:38:21.729
UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES BUT WHEN

01:38:21.795 --> 01:38:23.330
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT.

01:38:23.397 --> 01:38:24.665
WHAT THESE PLANS MAY BE

01:38:24.732 --> 01:38:26.700
CONTRIBUTING TO THAN THAN THEIR

01:38:26.767 --> 01:38:27.935
MORE PROTECTIVE OF THEM OVERALL

01:38:28.002 --> 01:38:30.738
THANKS MY LAST QUESTION FOR BOTH

01:38:30.804 --> 01:38:31.739
OF YOU IS?

01:38:31.805 --> 01:38:32.973
DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT

01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:34.141
THE COURT THE COOPERATION AND

01:38:34.208 --> 01:38:35.409
COLLABORATION BETWEEN LOCAL

01:38:35.476 --> 01:38:36.477
GOVERNMENTS AND STATE AGENCIES

01:38:36.543 --> 01:38:38.178
AT THIS POINT IS THERE ANYTHING

01:38:38.245 --> 01:38:39.513
THAT WE NEED TO SHORE UP IN

01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:41.415
TERMS OF AND TERMS OF THE

01:38:41.482 --> 01:38:44.652
COLLABORATION.

01:38:44.718 --> 01:38:46.253
SO YES I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:47.888
THINGS --

01:38:47.955 --> 01:38:49.323
ONE IS -- TO

01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:50.858
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FIRE

01:38:50.924 --> 01:38:52.993
SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS

01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:55.095
A FAIRLY UNIFIED GROUP OF

01:38:55.162 --> 01:38:56.630
INDIVIDUALS AND DEPARTMENTS AND

01:38:56.697 --> 01:38:58.232
THEY HAVE LOTS OF WAYS OF

01:38:58.299 --> 01:38:59.199
OPERATING TOGETHER YOU'RE

01:38:59.266 --> 01:39:01.135
WELCOME TO YOUR WITH MUTUAL AID

01:39:01.201 --> 01:39:03.137
CONCEPT--

01:39:03.203 --> 01:39:04.271
SO I DO THINK THAT.

01:39:04.338 --> 01:39:06.206
ARE MAKING SURE THAT YOUR LOCAL

01:39:06.273 --> 01:39:09.376
FIRE AGENCIES ARE AS INVOLVED IN

01:39:09.443 --> 01:39:11.111
THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND HOME

01:39:11.178 --> 01:39:12.613
HARDENING DISCUSSIONS.

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:14.114
ARE AS CAL FIRE IS IMPORTANT

01:39:14.181 --> 01:39:15.949
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE OUT REACH

01:39:16.016 --> 01:39:17.851
OUT THERE IN THE COMMUNITIES ARM

01:39:17.918 --> 01:39:19.753
AND ARE WIDESPREAD IN NEED TO BE

01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:21.088
PART OF THAT SOLUTION AS WELL.

01:39:21.155 --> 01:39:22.222
AND INCLUDED IN NEED OF THOSE

01:39:22.289 --> 01:39:24.892
DISCUSSIONS AS WELL AS EDUCATED

01:39:24.958 --> 01:39:26.527
TOGETHER.

01:39:26.593 --> 01:39:28.962
OKAY BUT I WILL TURN TO MY CO

01:39:29.029 --> 01:39:30.064
CHAIR AND SEE IF HE HAS ANY

01:39:30.130 --> 01:39:31.332
QUESTIONS --

01:39:31.398 --> 01:39:32.232
I'M JUST GOING TO TALK ABOUT

01:39:32.299 --> 01:39:33.467
OBSERVATIONS --

01:39:33.534 --> 01:39:37.705
I HAD MANY FIRE ME TOO MANY --

01:39:37.771 --> 01:39:39.740
AND MOBILE HOMES --

01:39:39.807 --> 01:39:41.175
WHETHER ALSO CALLED MANUFACTURED

01:39:41.241 --> 01:39:42.843
HOMES --

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:45.446
THEY WIND UP LIKE TOOTHPICKS.

01:39:45.512 --> 01:39:47.815
ENDED MANY RETIRED PEOPLE PEOPLE

01:39:47.881 --> 01:39:49.483
ON A LIMITED INCOME LIVE IN

01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:50.484
THOSE --

01:39:50.551 --> 01:39:52.386
HOMES AS WELL AS FAMILIES AND

01:39:52.453 --> 01:39:54.188
OTHER PEOPLE BUT THERE'S GOT TO

01:39:54.254 --> 01:39:56.290
BE SOMETHING BECAUSE WHOLE

01:39:56.357 --> 01:39:58.125
TRACKS WENT DOWN.

01:39:58.192 --> 01:40:00.060
A FEW INTERVIEW COUNTY.

01:40:00.127 --> 01:40:01.095
YOU'LL SEE IT.

01:40:01.161 --> 01:40:03.330
YOU WENT TO OF SANTA ROSA YOU'VE

01:40:03.397 --> 01:40:04.865
SEEN IT --

01:40:04.932 --> 01:40:06.100
IT'S HARD TO BE AN INDUSTRY IN

01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:07.368
THAT INDUSTRY AND FOR ME TO BE

01:40:07.434 --> 01:40:08.502
POINTING FINGERS I'M NOT

01:40:08.569 --> 01:40:09.903
POINTING FINGERS I JUST THINK

01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:11.105
THAT WE NEED.

01:40:11.171 --> 01:40:13.340
TO RE EVALUATE SOME INCENTIVES

01:40:13.407 --> 01:40:14.641
FOR SOME PEOPLE TO GET SOME KIND

01:40:14.708 --> 01:40:16.443
OF UPGRADES TO THOSE BECAUSE

01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:18.045
MANY PEOPLE DO LIVE IN THEM.

01:40:18.112 --> 01:40:19.446
AND THERE WERE IN A HOUSING

01:40:19.513 --> 01:40:21.215
CRUNCH AND THE LAST THING I WANT

01:40:21.281 --> 01:40:22.950
TO DO IS TAKE THAT OPTION OFF

01:40:23.016 --> 01:40:23.984
THE TABLE.

01:40:24.051 --> 01:40:25.919
BUT IT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE AS

01:40:25.986 --> 01:40:27.521
A TEAM HERE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

01:40:27.588 --> 01:40:28.756
HOW WE CAN --

01:40:28.822 --> 01:40:31.191
ADDRESS THAT GOING FORWARD SO --

01:40:31.258 --> 01:40:32.659
JUST AS AN OBSERVATION THAT WAS

01:40:32.726 --> 01:40:35.396
PROBABLY THE MOST OF THE HARDEST

01:40:35.462 --> 01:40:36.096
THING THAT I'VE SEEN BECAUSE

01:40:36.163 --> 01:40:38.766
MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE

01:40:38.832 --> 01:40:39.199
UNINSURED.

01:40:39.266 --> 01:40:41.301
RETIRED.

01:40:41.368 --> 01:40:45.672
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

01:40:45.739 --> 01:40:47.007
I ACTUALLY DO HAVE ONE OTHER

01:40:47.074 --> 01:40:48.175
QUESTION I FORGOT.

01:40:48.242 --> 01:40:49.610
DO YOU IS THERE A CONNECTION

01:40:49.676 --> 01:40:51.145
THAT YOU SEE BETWEEN.

01:40:51.211 --> 01:40:52.880
SORT OF BUILDING DENSITY IN

01:40:52.946 --> 01:40:55.649
THESE AREAS AND THE FIRE RISK OR

01:40:55.716 --> 01:40:57.518
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IF ONE

01:40:57.584 --> 01:40:58.919
HOUSE IS NOT HARD IT'S CLOSE TO

01:40:58.986 --> 01:41:00.387
ANOTHER ONE THAT'S MADE FOR IT

01:41:00.454 --> 01:41:01.722
LET'S ASSUME THAT THEY'RE ALL.

01:41:01.789 --> 01:41:04.858
RELATIVELY NEW HOUSES --

01:41:04.925 --> 01:41:06.460
IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH WITH.

01:41:06.527 --> 01:41:07.995
WITH THE DENSITY OR IS THE DATA

01:41:08.061 --> 01:41:11.298
JUST NOT CLEAR ON THAT.

01:41:11.365 --> 01:41:12.666
MY UNDERSTANDING FROM LARGER

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:14.168
DATASETS IS THE PROXIMITY TO

01:41:14.234 --> 01:41:15.436
YOUR NEAREST HOUSE IS A HEAVY

01:41:15.502 --> 01:41:17.404
CONTRIBUTOR TO TO YOUR SURVIVAL

01:41:17.471 --> 01:41:18.872
IN GENERAL IF YOU LOOK AT COFFEE

01:41:18.939 --> 01:41:20.174
PARK FOR EXAMPLE MEAN THAT.

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:21.742
THE DRUG PLANS BETWEEN THOSE

01:41:21.809 --> 01:41:23.143
HOUSES WITH LESS THAN FIVE FEET

01:41:23.210 --> 01:41:25.112
SO YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF

01:41:25.179 --> 01:41:27.514
EXPOSURE IS IS SIGNIFICANT.

01:41:27.581 --> 01:41:28.582
YOU KNOW ONCE YOU'VE GOT ONE

01:41:28.649 --> 01:41:30.617
HOME CAUGHT ON FIRE THAT IT'S

01:41:30.684 --> 01:41:31.084
IT'S IT'S EASY TO GET

01:41:31.151 --> 01:41:31.985
OVERWHELMED.

01:41:32.052 --> 01:41:32.786
I MEAN THESE ARE FUNDAMENTAL

01:41:32.853 --> 01:41:34.455
CHALLENGES OF HOW WE HOW WE DEAL

01:41:34.521 --> 01:41:36.323
WITH YOU KNOW HIGH DENSITY

01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:38.091
LIVING AND SMART LIVING AND I I

01:41:38.158 --> 01:41:39.159
DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS BUT I

01:41:39.226 --> 01:41:40.461
I THINK WE'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT

01:41:40.527 --> 01:41:41.361
ARE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT THESE

01:41:41.428 --> 01:41:42.563
THINGS IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY AND

01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:43.063
I APPRECIATE.

01:41:43.130 --> 01:41:46.099
YOUR CONSIDERATION TO THESE

01:41:46.166 --> 01:41:46.333
ISSUES.

01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:47.768
OKAY.

01:41:47.835 --> 01:41:48.869
WHAT ONCE AGAIN ON THE RESEARCH

01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:50.571
IS VERY LIMITED IN TERMS OF HOW

01:41:50.637 --> 01:41:51.538
WE ANALYZE THIS AND UNDERSTAND

01:41:51.605 --> 01:41:53.173
IT -- AND I

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:54.308
WOULD SAY THAT KIND OF

01:41:54.374 --> 01:41:56.143
EXPERIENCE LEAVE MY GUESS IS

01:41:56.210 --> 01:41:57.277
THAT OUR ANSWERS ARE GOING TO

01:41:57.344 --> 01:41:58.412
LIE IN.

01:41:58.479 --> 01:42:00.581
IF YOU HAVE CREATED A HARDENED

01:42:00.647 --> 01:42:01.882
STRUCTURE AND ENFORCED

01:42:01.949 --> 01:42:03.917
DEFENSIBLE SPACE THE ANSWER IS

01:42:03.984 --> 01:42:05.219
BUILDING DENSITIES ARE

01:42:05.285 --> 01:42:07.688
SUPPORTABLE THE HIGHER DENSITIES

01:42:07.754 --> 01:42:08.922
ARE ACCEPTABLE.

01:42:08.989 --> 01:42:10.123
THAT'S FINE AND THEN AFTER A

01:42:10.190 --> 01:42:12.626
WHILE YOU IF THEY ARE

01:42:12.693 --> 01:42:14.228
THREATENING TO ONE ANOTHER IF

01:42:14.294 --> 01:42:15.028
THEY'RE COUPLE HUNDRED FEET

01:42:15.095 --> 01:42:16.196
APART THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

01:42:16.263 --> 01:42:17.331
IGNITE ONE ANOTHER.

01:42:17.397 --> 01:42:19.533
BUT BUT I KNOW THAT JUST WE KNOW

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.467
WHERE WE'RE HEADED WITH OUR

01:42:20.534 --> 01:42:21.902
HOUSING NEEDS IN OUR DENSITY

01:42:21.969 --> 01:42:23.437
ISSUES -- I

01:42:23.504 --> 01:42:25.672
THINK THAT TAKING A LOOK AT HOW

01:42:25.739 --> 01:42:28.976
THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY IS TREATED --

01:42:29.042 --> 01:42:31.044

01:42:31.111 --> 01:42:31.678

TOWARD.

01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:33.614
TOWARD ALLOWING THAT WITHOUT

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:34.915
THREATENING ONE ANOTHER.

01:51:32.652 --> 01:51:35.422
LITTLE ODD CONNECTING UP DOT COM

01:51:35.488 --> 01:51:37.457

01:52:31.077 --> 01:52:32.445
IN THIS COMMUNITY AND

01:52:32.512 --> 01:52:35.915
EVERYBODY'S LIKE YOU KNOW MORE.

01:52:35.982 --> 01:52:37.450
AND THEY'RE SCARED.

01:52:37.517 --> 01:52:39.452
AND THE NAPA FIRES REALLY

01:52:39.519 --> 01:52:41.387
SURPRISED A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT

01:52:41.454 --> 01:52:42.856
THEY FIGURE WELL OKAY THE LITTLE

01:52:42.922 --> 01:52:44.624
THE LAST FIRE WE HAD IN THIS

01:52:44.691 --> 01:52:45.992
YEAR YOU IS THEY HENLEY FIRE I

01:52:46.059 --> 01:52:47.894
THINK THAT WAS LIKE SIXTY FOUR

01:52:47.961 --> 01:52:48.761
SIXTY SIX SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

01:52:48.828 --> 01:52:51.531
THE TUBS FIRE WAS ALMOST EXACTLY

01:52:51.598 --> 01:52:53.166
THE SAME PATTERN.

01:52:53.233 --> 01:52:54.901
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL THE PARADISE

01:52:54.968 --> 01:52:56.903
FIRE THAT REALLY REALIZE THIS IS

01:52:56.970 --> 01:52:59.172
THIS IS SERIOUS THIS IS THIS IS

01:52:59.239 --> 01:53:00.874
REAL THIS IS ACCIDENTAL.

01:53:00.940 --> 01:53:03.576
AND SO I THINK THAT WE'VE GOT TO

01:53:03.643 --> 01:53:04.711
FIND.

01:53:04.777 --> 01:53:07.147
WAYS -- TO

MAY HELP THE AVERAGE HOMEOWNER

01:53:09.649 --> 01:53:15.388
AND ENDS THE THE THE MARSHALL.

01:53:15.455 --> 01:53:17.924
SAID THAT IN 85% OF THE 95% OF

01:53:17.991 --> 01:53:19.492
THE FIRES THAT START --

01:53:19.559 --> 01:53:19.759
STARTED --

01:53:19.826 --> 01:53:21.227
BY.

01:53:21.294 --> 01:53:22.529
PEOPLE.

01:53:22.595 --> 01:53:22.829
THAT'S TRUE.

01:53:22.896 --> 01:53:25.198
AND BIG BIG BEEN --

01:53:25.265 --> 01:53:26.566
FIRES THAT MAKE THE HEADLINE

01:53:26.633 --> 01:53:28.568
NEWS THAT ASIDE AS A FIREFIGHTER

01:53:28.635 --> 01:53:30.170
WHEN WE ROLL INTO A VEGETATION

01:53:30.236 --> 01:53:31.671
FIRE IT'S BECAUSE SOMEONE WITH

01:53:31.738 --> 01:53:32.906
CUTTING THE GRASS AND AND THE

01:53:32.972 --> 01:53:34.541

DAY IN DAY OUT [inaudible]

01:53:44.317 --> 01:53:47.520
THE THE PROBLEM THOUGH IS THAT

01:53:47.587 --> 01:53:49.455
THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT

01:59:19.452 --> 01:59:21.420
COMPREHENSIVE --

01:59:21.487 --> 01:59:23.890
OF MEASURE SO WE NEED TO MAKE

01:59:23.956 --> 01:59:24.857
SURE THAT THEY'LL BOTH GET

01:59:24.924 --> 01:59:25.858
TOGETHER SO WE WORKING VERY

01:59:25.925 --> 01:59:31.664
CLOSELY WITH CAL FIRE TO MAKE

01:59:31.731 --> 01:59:32.932
THAT HAPPEN.

01:59:32.999 --> 01:59:34.667

WORK WITH THEM. TO HAVE THAT

01:59:38.337 --> 01:59:41.641
VEGETATION AND STRUCTURE OF

01:59:41.707 --> 01:59:41.908
COURSE --

01:59:41.974 --> 01:59:43.276
DATA.

01:59:43.342 --> 01:59:45.912
IT STARTED BUILDING IT UP OF THE

01:59:45.978 --> 01:59:48.481
SURF TWO REASONS ONE IS TO HELP.

01:59:48.548 --> 01:59:50.283
HELP US HELD THE PROPERTY OWNER

01:59:50.349 --> 01:59:52.118
TO MAKE A HOME SAFER BUT IN CASE

01:59:52.184 --> 01:59:52.752
SOMETHING HAPPENS ALSO WE CUPS

01:59:52.818 --> 01:59:54.720
WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED OR WHAT IT

01:59:54.787 --> 01:59:56.789
WAS THERE BEFORE THE FIRE CAME.

01:59:56.856 --> 01:59:59.859
ON TO SOMETHING DID BURN WHY

01:59:59.926 --> 02:00:00.826
COULD HAVE BEEN THE REASON THAT

02:00:00.893 --> 02:00:03.229
APART BUT IT DIDN'T BURN WHY DID

02:00:03.296 --> 02:00:04.030
THEIR NUMBER SO WE GOT TO STUDY

02:00:04.096 --> 02:00:05.898
THE THE THE HEALTHY.

02:00:05.965 --> 02:00:08.768
AND THE ON HEALTH --

02:00:08.834 --> 02:00:09.936
BUT I THINK THAT WE DO --

02:00:10.002 --> 02:00:11.604
AND INSPECTION WORLD BUT IS NOT

02:00:11.671 --> 02:00:13.105
REALLY SPECTRUM IS A COOPERATIVE

02:00:13.172 --> 02:00:14.173
PROGRAM THAT WOULD DO THE

02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:17.376
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON.

02:00:17.443 --> 02:00:22.381
WE CALLED I AM --

02:00:22.448 --> 02:00:24.951
POLICE THEMSELVES AND WE GO OUT

02:00:25.017 --> 02:00:27.353
THERE INVEST INSPECT UP --

02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:30.289
POLLS AND LINES WITH THE PERSON

02:00:30.356 --> 02:00:31.424
WAS GOING TO BE DONE THE WORK OF

02:00:31.490 --> 02:00:32.758
WE KEEP TRACK OF THAT AND THEN

02:00:32.825 --> 02:00:34.594
WE FOLLOW UP AGAIN IS NOT AN

02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:36.429
INSPECTION TO CYCLE OPERATION.

02:00:36.495 --> 02:00:39.565
BUT THEN WE TRIED WE ASSIST.

02:00:39.632 --> 02:00:41.767
US IN CALIFORNIA EDISON TO THE

02:00:41.834 --> 02:00:43.502
WORK AND I THINK THAT IT HELP

02:00:43.569 --> 02:00:45.104
ANSWER THIS BACHELORS OPENS A

02:00:45.171 --> 02:00:45.938
LOT OF THE WORKS.

02:00:46.005 --> 02:00:47.907
ARE AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A BIG

02:00:47.974 --> 02:00:49.642
EUCALYPTUS THREE THAT IS RIGHT

02:00:49.709 --> 02:00:50.443
NEXT TO A LINE.

02:00:50.509 --> 02:00:52.511
AND THEN IS TO BE GONE WE CAN

02:00:52.578 --> 02:00:54.714
WORK WITH EDISON'S TO THE

02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:57.083
PROPERTY OWNER WANTS HAD GONE.

02:00:57.149 --> 02:00:59.352
AN EDISON.

02:00:59.418 --> 02:01:01.253
IS JUST DOING ALL THAT MAIN AS

02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:05.925
WE ASSESS ON THAT COLLABORATION

02:01:05.992 --> 02:01:07.693
BETWEEN THE TWO SO THAT.

02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:09.362
OUR SELECTION AND IF IT'S

02:01:09.428 --> 02:01:10.696
SOMETHING IS GOING TO BE PLANTED

02:01:10.763 --> 02:01:11.263
IN THERE WE CAN ASSESS THE

02:01:11.330 --> 02:01:12.565
PROPERTY OWNER WHAT TO PLANT

02:01:12.632 --> 02:01:13.199
THAT IS NOT GOING TO AFFECT THE

02:01:13.265 --> 02:01:14.900
POWER LINES SO THAT'S ONE OF

02:01:14.967 --> 02:01:16.569
SOLUTIONS THAT WE GOT.

02:01:16.636 --> 02:01:17.570
AND I THINK THAT WE KIND OF IN

02:01:17.637 --> 02:01:18.871
THE COUNT IS WHAT WE CALL THE

02:01:18.938 --> 02:01:21.240
FUEL MODIFICATION BLUNDER VIEW.

02:01:21.307 --> 02:01:23.442
SO YOU HAVE A NEW CONSTRUCTION

02:01:23.509 --> 02:01:24.944
FOR A TO REMODEL THERE'S MORE

02:01:25.011 --> 02:01:28.914
THAN 50% OF THE SQUARE FOOTAGE

02:01:28.981 --> 02:01:30.516
OF THE HOME.

SURE PROBABLY LORD AS AS WELL.

02:06:20.239 --> 02:06:21.240
I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE

02:06:21.307 --> 02:06:22.574
ABOUT EDUCATION EDUCATION

02:06:22.641 --> 02:06:24.777
EDUCATION --

02:06:24.843 --> 02:06:25.811
IT'S EASY TO SAY YOU DON'T KNOW

02:06:25.878 --> 02:06:27.613
BUT IF YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:28.781
OUT THERE AND OBVIOUSLY MEANT

02:06:28.847 --> 02:06:30.115
ALL OF YOU WERE DOING THAT I'M

02:06:30.182 --> 02:06:31.717
TRYING TO BUT THERE'S SO MANY

02:06:31.784 --> 02:06:33.218
PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT THEY DON'T

02:06:33.285 --> 02:06:34.520
WANT TO KNOW.

02:06:34.586 --> 02:06:36.588
MY REAL COMMUNITIES --

02:06:36.655 --> 02:06:38.223
AS MANY TIMES AS A FIRE

02:06:38.290 --> 02:06:40.259
DEPARTMENT OR UTILITIES OR

02:06:40.326 --> 02:06:42.261
WHATEVER TRIES TO GO TO THEIR

02:06:42.328 --> 02:06:43.262
LAND.

02:06:43.329 --> 02:06:45.030
DOES THE PRIVATE PROPERTY AND

02:06:45.097 --> 02:06:46.332
THEN THAT THEY MAKE IT VERY

02:06:46.398 --> 02:06:47.700
DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO GO OUT

02:06:47.766 --> 02:06:49.268
THERE AND I THINK.

02:06:49.335 --> 02:06:51.270
WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THE RESULTS

02:06:51.337 --> 02:06:52.771
OF THAT FROM SOME OF THE FIRES.

02:06:52.838 --> 02:06:54.473
AND SO THE CHALLENGES IS THAT

02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:56.775
HOW DO WE GET THOSE PEOPLE TO

02:06:56.842 --> 02:06:57.977
GET ON BOARD THE SOME AT LEAST

02:06:58.043 --> 02:06:59.912
SOME DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND TO

02:06:59.979 --> 02:07:01.347
REALIZE THAT THEY'RE HARMING NOT

02:07:01.413 --> 02:07:02.848
ONLY.

02:07:02.915 --> 02:07:04.917
THEMSELVES BUT THEY'RE HARMING.

02:07:04.984 --> 02:07:07.052
OTHERS ALONG THE WAY SO --

02:07:07.119 --> 02:07:09.555
YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S A TOUGH ONE

02:07:09.621 --> 02:07:11.724
BERMAN AS WE KNOW IN --

02:07:11.790 --> 02:07:14.326
OF THE CAMPFIRE WE WERE MISSING

02:07:14.393 --> 02:07:14.893
QUITE A FEW PEOPLE FOR QUITE

02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:16.462
SOME TIME.

02:07:16.528 --> 02:07:17.863
IT'S COULD THOUGHT OF THAT MANY

02:07:17.930 --> 02:07:18.530
OF THOSE PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO

02:07:18.597 --> 02:07:19.832
BE FOUND THEY LIVED UP IN THE

02:07:19.898 --> 02:07:21.800
HILLS AND YOU KNOW WHO KNOWS

02:07:21.867 --> 02:07:23.168
WHAT'S HAPPENED UP THERE BUT THE

02:07:23.235 --> 02:07:24.603
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS I'M

02:07:24.670 --> 02:07:26.005
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT.

02:07:26.071 --> 02:07:28.040
HIS RURAL AREAS I MEAN I THINK

02:07:28.107 --> 02:07:28.640
YOU'RE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB

02:07:28.707 --> 02:07:30.642
ANYMORE CUT CONCENTRATED URBAN

02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:31.477
AREAS.

02:07:31.543 --> 02:07:32.978
BUT I THINK THIS MISTER THOMPSON

02:07:33.045 --> 02:07:34.847
KNOWS IS IT SOME UP IN OUR AREAS

02:07:34.913 --> 02:07:36.015
UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IT'S

02:07:36.081 --> 02:07:37.249
VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THAT

02:07:37.316 --> 02:07:38.384
EDUCATION.

02:07:38.450 --> 02:07:39.785
AND TO GET PEOPLE TO GET

02:07:39.852 --> 02:07:41.253
TOGETHER TO ACTUALLY HAVE THESE

02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:42.755
REALLY GOOD CONVERSATIONS OF

02:07:42.821 --> 02:07:45.391
PUTTING THESE GROUPS TOGETHER SO --

02:07:45.457 --> 02:07:46.492
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SOME

02:07:46.558 --> 02:07:48.027
IDEAS THAT I PICKED UP HERE

02:07:48.093 --> 02:07:49.395
TODAY --

02:07:49.461 --> 02:07:51.397
ALSO IS THAT I'M SURE YOU DO

02:07:51.463 --> 02:07:52.965
THIS BUT I'M HOPING THIS IS DONE

02:07:53.032 --> 02:07:54.566
IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES --

02:07:54.633 --> 02:07:56.735
WE CAME UP WITH THE FIRES THAT

02:07:56.802 --> 02:07:59.071
WE IT HAD THE IN OUR AREA WAS

02:07:59.138 --> 02:08:00.472
THAT WE HAD MANY PEOPLE THAT

02:08:00.539 --> 02:08:02.041
DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH.

02:08:02.107 --> 02:08:02.908
AND WE HAD A HARD TIME MAKING

02:08:02.975 --> 02:08:05.210
SURE IN IT WASN'T INTENTIONAL

02:08:05.277 --> 02:08:06.445
READ ALTHOUGH WE COMMUNICATE IN

02:08:06.512 --> 02:08:08.180
SPANISH BUT THERE IS MANY OTHER

02:08:08.247 --> 02:08:09.415
LANGUAGES THAT ARE OUT THERE.

02:08:09.481 --> 02:08:10.582
SO THAT --

02:08:10.649 --> 02:08:11.884
AND DO YOU DO THAT CURRENTLY OR

02:08:11.950 --> 02:08:13.385
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT NO

02:08:13.452 --> 02:08:14.953
ONE'S LEFT BEHIND ON SOME OF

02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:17.022
THESE EDUCATION TOOLS AND IF YOU

02:08:17.089 --> 02:08:21.727
ANSWER THAT IN A SECOND --

02:08:21.794 --> 02:08:24.630
MAYES ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY.

02:08:24.696 --> 02:08:26.131
THERE'S A HOME OWNER OR PROPERTY

02:08:26.198 --> 02:08:27.699
OWNER THE LACK OF RUNS

02:08:27.766 --> 02:08:29.034
RESPONSIBILITY IT'S EASY TO

02:08:29.101 --> 02:08:30.636
POINT FINGERS AND AS YOU SAID IS

02:08:30.702 --> 02:08:32.805
90% OR 95% OF THE FIRES ARE DONE

02:08:32.871 --> 02:08:34.473
BY THE PUBLIC --

02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:36.108
EDUCATING PEOPLE TO EVEN LEARN

02:08:36.175 --> 02:08:37.476
HOW TO WALK INTO THE WALKING

02:08:37.543 --> 02:08:38.410
TRAILS.

02:08:38.477 --> 02:08:39.311
YOU MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT

02:08:39.378 --> 02:08:41.213
TAKING EXTRA THINGS ALONG THE

02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:43.415
WAY I'VE SEEN IT WITNESS IT WENT

02:08:43.482 --> 02:08:45.384
TOO MANY TIMES THEY'LL SAY NO DO

02:08:45.451 --> 02:08:46.518
KNOW DOGS.

02:08:46.585 --> 02:08:47.719
AND WHAT HAPPENS EVERYONE'S GOT

02:08:47.786 --> 02:08:48.754
A DOG GOING ON THE WORKING TO

02:08:48.821 --> 02:08:49.988
THERE'S A REASON THOSE THINGS

02:08:50.055 --> 02:08:51.056
HAPPEN RIGHT.

02:08:51.123 --> 02:08:52.157
AND SO --

02:08:52.224 --> 02:08:53.559
WE'RE NOT PROTECTING OUR NATURAL

02:08:53.625 --> 02:08:55.127
RESOURCES AS WELL AS WHEN PEOPLE

02:08:55.194 --> 02:08:56.762
ARE NOT BEING --

02:08:56.829 --> 02:08:59.398
RESPONSIBLE AND HONOR OUR OPEN

02:08:59.465 --> 02:09:03.535
SPACE AND SO I'VE HAD THE LAST

02:09:03.602 --> 02:09:04.903
THING I'D EVER WANT TO DO DURING.

02:09:04.970 --> 02:09:06.572
IS TO CLOSE DOWN OPEN SPACE

02:09:06.638 --> 02:09:07.606
DURING FIRE SEASON FUHRMAN

02:09:07.673 --> 02:09:09.475
FOLLOW THE RULES WE WOULDN'T

02:09:09.541 --> 02:09:11.310
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT SO I

02:09:11.376 --> 02:09:12.811
WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT THAT --

02:09:12.878 --> 02:09:13.879
DOES IT IT'S IT IF YOU WERE TO

02:09:13.946 --> 02:09:14.980
ASK ME MY BATTALION CHIEF WHAT

02:09:15.047 --> 02:09:17.015
WERE THE TOP THREE THINGS THAT

02:09:17.082 --> 02:09:19.485
THEY SAW DURING THE TUBS FIRE.

02:09:19.551 --> 02:09:21.687
THAT WERE THE CAUSATION FOR A

02:09:21.753 --> 02:09:23.589
LOT OF STRUCTURE FIRES --

02:09:23.655 --> 02:09:24.823
DAVID SAY.

02:09:24.890 --> 02:09:29.027
WOOD CHIPS AROUND THE PERIMETER

02:09:29.094 --> 02:09:29.361
OF THE HOME.

02:09:29.428 --> 02:09:32.898
HOME COMPUTER MARKET SOME PEOPLE

02:09:32.965 --> 02:09:35.868
CAUGHT THAT.

02:09:35.934 --> 02:09:38.237
AND THEN WOOD DECKS WITHOUT ANY

02:09:38.303 --> 02:09:40.539
SKIRTING EARNING PROTECTION OR

02:09:40.606 --> 02:09:42.374
ANYTHING AND THEN WE HOPE MORE

02:09:42.441 --> 02:09:44.676
KIND GRASS UNDERNEATH THE THE

02:09:44.743 --> 02:09:45.611
TEXAS OF WHAT.

02:09:45.677 --> 02:09:48.747
WE WE DID A INSPECTION OF COPY

02:09:48.814 --> 02:09:50.415
PARK.

02:09:50.482 --> 02:09:52.784
AS FIRE STATION RIGHT AFTER THE

02:09:52.851 --> 02:09:53.752
FIRES ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

02:09:53.819 --> 02:09:55.454
SAW WAS THAT PEOPLE PARKED THERE --

02:09:55.521 --> 02:09:57.356
PLASTIC.

02:09:57.422 --> 02:09:59.892
RECYCLE AND TRASH BINS RIGHT UP

02:09:59.958 --> 02:10:01.627
AGAINST THE HOUSE UNDERNEATH THE

02:10:01.693 --> 02:10:03.061
EAVES UNDERNEATH THE OVERHANG

02:10:03.128 --> 02:10:04.496
AND SO WHEN YOU START TALKING

02:10:04.563 --> 02:10:05.831
ABOUT EMBERS YOU HAVE TO START

02:10:05.898 --> 02:10:07.399
SAME OKAY WHEN THE EMBERS GET

02:10:07.466 --> 02:10:09.001
THERE.

02:10:09.067 --> 02:10:10.135
WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM?

02:10:10.202 --> 02:10:11.570
YOU KNOW GOING IN THE ATTIC

02:10:11.637 --> 02:10:12.938
LANDING ON THE WOOD CHIPS IN IN

02:10:13.005 --> 02:10:14.506
A LOT OF CASES THEY PLAN ON

02:10:14.573 --> 02:10:15.707
THESE PLASTIC BINS IN THOSE

02:10:15.774 --> 02:10:16.875
PLASTIC BINS.

02:10:16.942 --> 02:10:19.278
JUST GO OFF LIKE A ROMAN CANDLE

02:10:19.344 --> 02:10:20.812
UP THE SIDE OF THE WALL ENTER

02:10:20.879 --> 02:10:23.749
THE EAVES OF THE HOUSE AND THEN

02:10:23.815 --> 02:10:25.617
YOU'RE OFF TO THE RACES AND SO.

02:10:25.684 --> 02:10:28.820
I HAVE FOUND THROUGH OUR FSC

02:10:28.887 --> 02:10:29.021
THAT.

02:10:29.087 --> 02:10:30.589
THAT HAVING --

02:10:30.656 --> 02:10:34.793
SOME VERY SIMPLE. TO DUES ACROSS

02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:36.495
THIS PRODUCT OFF THE LIST.

02:10:36.562 --> 02:10:37.829
PEOPLE ARE VERY RECEPTIVE THEY

02:10:37.896 --> 02:10:40.232
JUST FEEL COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED

02:10:40.299 --> 02:10:41.567
WHEN THEY SAY THEY GET ALL THIS

02:10:41.633 --> 02:10:43.235
INFORMATION AT ONCE AND THAT'S

02:10:43.302 --> 02:10:45.270
NOT WITHIN THE VERNACULAR THEY

02:10:45.337 --> 02:10:47.773
UNDERSTAND OR USED.

02:10:47.839 --> 02:10:48.340
TO HERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE

02:10:48.407 --> 02:10:49.708
MONEY TO DO IT.

02:10:49.775 --> 02:10:50.876
OR THEY WANT TO WRITE A CHECK

02:10:50.943 --> 02:10:52.044
AND HAVE SOME DO IT FOR THEM.

02:10:52.110 --> 02:10:55.013
AND IF 8095% OF THE FIRES A

02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:56.548
START BY HOMEOWNERS IN IN OUR

02:10:56.615 --> 02:10:58.584

DOLLARS OF GRANT MONEY COMING IN

02:11:00.085 --> 02:11:03.021
HAS TO BE USED FOR COUNTY ROADS

02:11:03.088 --> 02:11:03.589
WE CAN'T USE IT FOR PRIVATE

02:11:03.655 --> 02:11:05.257
PROPERTIES.

02:11:05.324 --> 02:11:07.092
THERE'S A PROBLEM THERE YEAH WE

02:11:07.159 --> 02:11:08.727

02:11:08.794 --> 02:11:10.095
TAKE CARE OF THE ZONES ON YOUR

02:11:10.162 --> 02:11:11.430
SIDE OF THE ROAD BUT WE CAN'T

02:11:11.496 --> 02:11:12.598
GET INTO PEOPLE'S PROPERTY WITH

02:11:12.664 --> 02:11:14.600
THAT MONEY AND THAT'S WHERE A

02:11:14.666 --> 02:11:15.701

02:18:52.023 --> 02:18:52.991
THAT A BUT SAID.

02:18:53.058 --> 02:18:54.859
SO WE DIRECTED THOSE GRANT FUNDS

02:18:54.926 --> 02:18:57.195
TOWARDS THAT AND IT WAS AMAZING

02:18:57.262 --> 02:18:58.830
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A TWO HUNDRED

02:18:58.897 --> 02:19:01.132
WAIT LIST IN WE'VE JUST GOT SOME

02:19:01.199 --> 02:19:02.100
GRANTS WILL COME AND THEN I'LL

02:19:02.167 --> 02:19:04.936
HAVE IS CHIPPING AWAY WITH THAT.

02:19:05.003 --> 02:19:06.938
BUT WE NEVER ADVERTISE FOR

02:19:07.005 --> 02:19:08.506
CHIPPING PROGRAMS.

02:19:08.573 --> 02:19:11.443
WE ADVERTISE WE ONLY HAD A 30%

02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:13.244
RESPONSE FOR THAT COMMUNITY

02:19:13.311 --> 02:19:15.146
AFTER WE STARTED WORK WE SEND

02:19:15.213 --> 02:19:17.615
OUT ANOTHER AND WE HAD AN 85%.

02:19:17.682 --> 02:19:19.918
CHANCE AND WITHIN FOUR MONTHS WE

02:19:19.984 --> 02:19:21.586
HAD EXPENDED THE FUNDS.

02:19:21.653 --> 02:19:24.689
AND PEOPLE WERE CALLING TO SEE

02:19:24.756 --> 02:19:25.957
IF WE HAD MORE.

02:19:26.024 --> 02:19:27.926
SO.

02:19:27.992 --> 02:19:29.461
THE THE PROCESS ISN'T THAT

02:19:29.527 --> 02:19:31.763
DIFFICULT BUT I THINK YOUR BEST

02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:34.532
CHANCES OF SUCCESS ARE TO WORK

02:19:34.599 --> 02:19:35.166
WITH THEM.

02:19:35.233 --> 02:19:38.002
AND FIND PROJECTS THAT YOU CAN

02:19:38.069 --> 02:19:42.006
DO AS AND WE DON'T.

02:19:42.073 --> 02:19:43.641
A FIRE SAFE COUNCIL OR NURSERY

02:19:43.708 --> 02:19:46.544
DE THAT WILL HELP THEM MEET

02:19:46.611 --> 02:19:48.146
THEIR FIRE PLAN GOALS

02:19:48.213 --> 02:19:48.446
[inaudible]

02:19:48.513 --> 02:19:51.683
GREAT --

02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:53.885
CHIEF --

02:19:53.952 --> 02:19:54.886
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK THERE'S A

02:19:54.953 --> 02:19:57.322
BENEFIT TO INSPECTING DEFENSIBLE

02:19:57.388 --> 02:19:59.891
SPACE EVERY YEAR SUPPOSED EVERY

02:19:59.958 --> 02:20:01.359
THREE YEARS OR DO YOU THINK IT?

02:20:01.426 --> 02:20:03.128
DOESN'T MAKE AS MUCH MAKE THAT

02:20:03.194 --> 02:20:05.063
MUCH DIFFERENCE.

02:20:05.130 --> 02:20:06.564
OTHER SEVEN EFFORT TO CASSETTE

02:20:06.631 --> 02:20:08.833
OXIDE ARE OF INTEREST IS A

02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:12.003
CONTACT SPORT AND THAT DAYLIGHT

02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:13.104
TO US NOT COMMON AND WHAT NOT

02:20:13.171 --> 02:20:13.638
EVERYBODY.

02:20:13.705 --> 02:20:15.173
BUT A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE LIKE TO

02:20:15.240 --> 02:20:16.975
US TO COME EVERY YEAR AND PAY A

02:20:17.041 --> 02:20:18.243
VISIT AND SEE HOW THEY'RE DOING.

02:20:18.309 --> 02:20:19.310
AND THEY GET A CHANCE TO YOU

02:20:19.377 --> 02:20:20.278
KNOW TALK ABOUT THE NEIGHBOR

02:20:20.345 --> 02:20:24.682
WHAT THE NEIGHBORS TO AND ALL

02:20:24.749 --> 02:20:26.684
THAT -- AND

02:20:26.751 --> 02:20:28.319
ANY KEEP THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH

02:20:28.386 --> 02:20:29.087
THEM --

02:20:29.154 --> 02:20:30.622
DEPTHFIRE PREVENTION OF THE

02:20:30.688 --> 02:20:31.823
PHYSICAL SPACES ALL YEAR ROUND

02:20:31.890 --> 02:20:33.057
PROCESS SO WE TRIED TO WORK WITH

02:20:33.124 --> 02:20:33.725
THEM.

02:20:33.792 --> 02:20:34.425
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR --

02:20:34.492 --> 02:20:35.927
AT INCIRLIK CALIFORNIA IS A

02:20:35.994 --> 02:20:36.661
LITTLE DIFFERENT AND I

02:20:36.728 --> 02:20:38.163
CALIFORNIA CHOPPER ALL THE

02:20:38.229 --> 02:20:39.864
GRASSES ARE VERY CLOSE TO EACH

02:20:39.931 --> 02:20:41.699
OTHER SO WE CAN.

02:20:41.766 --> 02:20:43.201
WE CUT TO BE REALLY VIGILANT TO

02:20:43.268 --> 02:20:45.370
WILL HOW THEY INTERACT SO WE TRY

02:20:45.436 --> 02:20:48.039
TO KEEP THAT SEPARATION.

02:20:48.106 --> 02:20:50.041
WITHIN.

02:20:50.108 --> 02:20:50.975
THE LEGISLATION OF ROUND THE

02:20:51.042 --> 02:20:52.510
HOMES BUT ALSO THE VEGETATION

02:20:52.577 --> 02:20:54.345
WITHIN THAT SPACE THOUGHT

02:20:54.412 --> 02:20:56.447
ORNAMENTAL BUDGET TATIAN.

02:20:56.514 --> 02:20:58.283
THE TENTH TO GET AWAY A BOOK ON

02:20:58.349 --> 02:20:59.951
BILLY I CAN GROW CAN GROW REALLY

02:21:00.018 --> 02:21:00.785
FAST IN ONE YEAR.

02:21:00.852 --> 02:21:02.687
AND BECOME A REAL PROBLEM FOR US

02:21:02.754 --> 02:21:05.957
SO IT'S GOOD TO REMIND HIM YEAR.

02:21:06.024 --> 02:21:09.260
IS SIX IS A LOT OF WORK FIND OUT

02:21:09.327 --> 02:21:10.128
WHAT IT WAS WHAT JUST LIKE TO

02:21:10.195 --> 02:21:11.896
ADD THAT I THINK.

02:21:11.963 --> 02:21:12.964
THERE SHOULD BE MORE MONEY.

02:21:13.031 --> 02:21:13.798
I THINK THAT THAT.

02:21:13.865 --> 02:21:16.367
WE SHOULD NOT BE TALKING ABOUT

02:21:16.434 --> 02:21:18.536
SPENDING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

02:21:18.603 --> 02:21:20.138
OF DOLLARS FOR PREVENTION WHEN

02:21:20.205 --> 02:21:22.073
WE'RE SPENDING BILLIONS OF

02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:23.808
DOLLARS TO MOP UP.

02:21:23.875 --> 02:21:25.543
AND SO I THINK THERE THERE IS AN

02:21:25.610 --> 02:21:28.880
IMPASSE TO BE AN EXPERT IN THIS

02:21:28.947 --> 02:21:31.583
IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM BUT I I

02:21:31.649 --> 02:21:32.984
I I THINK YOU KNOW IF YOU KNOW

02:21:33.051 --> 02:21:35.920
HOW TO DO IT.

02:21:35.987 --> 02:21:36.554
AND YOU HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE

02:21:36.621 --> 02:21:37.388
WITH IT.

02:21:37.455 --> 02:21:38.823
THEN I THINK YOU CAN MANAGE

02:21:38.890 --> 02:21:40.391
GETTING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF

02:21:40.458 --> 02:21:41.960
GETTING GRANTS AND SO FORTH.

02:21:42.026 --> 02:21:44.028
BUT I I THINK GIVE THEM WHAT THE

02:21:44.095 --> 02:21:46.264
GRANTS CAN DO AND HOW IT

02:21:46.331 --> 02:21:47.765
LEVERAGES.

02:21:47.832 --> 02:21:50.168
THE THE THE THE THESE LOCAL

02:21:50.235 --> 02:21:52.403
COMMUNITIES SO THAT ALL THAT IS

02:21:52.470 --> 02:21:54.372
TAKEN OFF THE BACKS OF CAL FIRE

02:21:54.439 --> 02:21:55.406
TO THEIR NOT HAVING TO DO ALL

02:21:55.473 --> 02:21:57.141
THAT --

02:21:57.208 --> 02:21:59.410
INSPECTION AND SO FORTH I THINK

02:21:59.477 --> 02:22:00.044
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE EMPHASIS

02:22:00.111 --> 02:22:02.247
ON IT.

02:22:02.313 --> 02:22:02.881
THANK YOU I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER

02:22:02.947 --> 02:22:04.249
QUESTIONS.

02:22:04.315 --> 02:22:07.318
I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHERS SAY WELL.

02:22:07.385 --> 02:22:07.952
YEAH I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF

02:22:08.019 --> 02:22:09.020

ABOUT WILDFIRES AND THEY'LL BE

02:22:13.424 --> 02:22:15.293
LOTS MORE BUT I FIND THAT EVERY

02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:16.895
TIME WE HAVE A DIFFERENT PANEL

02:22:16.961 --> 02:22:18.830

PUZZLE TOGETHER.

02:22:25.703 --> 02:22:26.771

RECENTLY MOVED TO WOODLAND AS A

02:23:06.177 --> 02:23:07.445
ONE WEEK SO.

02:23:07.512 --> 02:23:09.580
HAPPY TO BE IN YOUR DISTRICT --

02:23:09.647 --> 02:23:10.748
WANTED TO ECHO SOME OF THE

02:23:10.815 --> 02:23:12.717
THINGS THAT WE HEARD HERE TODAY

02:23:12.784 --> 02:23:13.618
ONE IS THAT THEY'RE ABOUT TO

02:23:13.685 --> 02:23:14.819
ORDER FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AROUND

02:23:14.886 --> 02:23:15.586
THE STATE.

02:23:15.653 --> 02:23:16.187
AND ALMOST ANOTHER TWO UNDER

02:23:16.254 --> 02:23:18.523
FIRE WAS COMMUNITIES AND THEY

02:23:18.589 --> 02:23:19.757
REALLY ARE FRONTLINE FOLKS THERE

02:23:19.824 --> 02:23:20.992
THE FOLKS ON THE GROUND WHO KNOW

02:23:21.059 --> 02:23:22.894
WHERE THEY LIVE WHO CARE ABOUT

02:23:22.961 --> 02:23:23.528
WHERE THEY LIVE WHO CARE ABOUT

02:23:23.594 --> 02:23:24.362
THEIR NEIGHBORS.

02:23:24.429 --> 02:23:25.296
AND ARE OUT THERE LOOKING AT

02:23:25.363 --> 02:23:26.698
WHAT THEY CAN DO TO MAKE THEIR

02:23:26.764 --> 02:23:28.766
COMMUNITIES MORE SAY SO I THINK.

02:23:28.833 --> 02:23:30.635
IT IT'S A I DON'T WANNA TALK

02:23:30.702 --> 02:23:31.836
TALK ABOUT FIRST ACCOUNTS IS A

02:23:31.903 --> 02:23:33.871
RESOURCE BUT REALLY IT IS A

02:23:33.938 --> 02:23:35.640
RESOURCE THAT WE HAVE STATEWIDE

02:23:35.707 --> 02:23:37.809
IN TERMS OF A WAY TO GET

02:23:37.875 --> 02:23:41.980
RESOURCES TO THE GROUND AND TO

02:23:42.046 --> 02:23:43.381
GET PRAGUE. TO IMPLEMENT

02:23:43.448 --> 02:23:45.083
PROGRAMS ON THE GROUND SOME SAY

02:23:45.149 --> 02:23:45.984
IT'S ALREADY IN PLACE WE DON'T

02:23:46.050 --> 02:23:47.485
HAVE TO REBUILD THAT --

02:23:47.552 --> 02:23:48.720
SOME YOU TALKED EARLIER ABOUT

02:23:48.786 --> 02:23:50.822
DOING HOME ASSESSMENTS ASSISTING

02:23:50.888 --> 02:23:52.523
WITH ELDERLY LOW INCOME FOLKS.

02:23:52.590 --> 02:23:54.592
CLOSER THAT'S WHERE THAT HAPPENS

02:23:54.659 --> 02:23:55.994
A LOT OF FIRES ARE COUNCILS WILL

02:23:56.060 --> 02:23:57.128
GET FUNDING OFTEN THROUGH OUR

02:23:57.195 --> 02:23:58.529
GRANT CLEARING HOUSE OR TO CAL

02:23:58.596 --> 02:24:00.398
FIRE. TO BE CREATING DEFENSIBLE

02:24:00.465 --> 02:24:02.400
SPACE FOR LOW INCOME ELDERLY

02:24:02.467 --> 02:24:03.801
DISABLED NEIGHBORS DOING

02:24:03.868 --> 02:24:04.869
SHIPPING PROGRAMS ON THOSE

02:24:04.936 --> 02:24:06.404
PROPERTIES SO THOSE ARE CRUCIAL

02:24:06.471 --> 02:24:07.905
IN TERMS OF TAKING CARE THEIR

02:24:07.972 --> 02:24:09.007
NEIGHBORS AND KNOWING WHERE

02:24:09.073 --> 02:24:10.675
THOSE NEIGHBORS ARE WHEN IT

02:24:10.742 --> 02:24:12.543
COMES TIME FOR EVACUATION --

02:24:12.610 --> 02:24:14.445
ALSO LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS DO

02:24:14.512 --> 02:24:17.749
THAT HERE'S THEIR ALSO FRONT

02:24:17.815 --> 02:24:20.051
LINE OUT THERE ON I JUST MOVED

02:24:20.118 --> 02:24:22.820
FROM HUMBLE COUNTY OF FORTY TWO

02:24:22.887 --> 02:24:24.188
DIFFERENT FIRE DEPARTMENTS.

02:24:24.255 --> 02:24:26.457
OF AGING WORKFORCE IN THE

02:24:26.524 --> 02:24:27.525
VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND

02:24:27.592 --> 02:24:29.160
THEY'RE ALSO DOING THOSE HOME

02:24:29.227 --> 02:24:30.928
ASSESSMENTS --

02:24:30.995 --> 02:24:33.698
BUT DEFINITELY A RESOURCE IN AN

02:24:33.765 --> 02:24:36.034
AREA THAT NEEDS SOME ATTENTION --

02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:38.036
MMHM.

02:24:38.102 --> 02:24:39.804
MY SENSE IS THAT IF WE COULD GET

02:24:39.871 --> 02:24:41.873
SOME FUNDING TO EVERY COUNTY FOR

02:24:41.939 --> 02:24:43.508
EACH COUNTY FIRE SAY COUNCIL

02:24:43.574 --> 02:24:45.343
THAT THEN COULD GET DOWN TO THE

02:24:45.410 --> 02:24:46.144
GROUND TO LOCAL PHARMACY

02:24:46.210 --> 02:24:47.645
COUNCILS THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT

02:24:47.712 --> 02:24:49.280
WOULD BE PRETTY PHENOMENAL.

02:24:49.347 --> 02:24:51.015
AND THAT WHAT YOU HEARD HERE WAS

02:24:51.082 --> 02:24:52.550
THAT THERE ARE THERE'S FUNDING

02:24:52.617 --> 02:24:54.085
FOR PROJECTS WERE SPECIALLY FOR

02:24:54.152 --> 02:24:55.319
FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS.

02:24:55.386 --> 02:24:56.454
LOT OF MONEY COMING DOWN TO THE

02:24:56.521 --> 02:24:58.056
GROUND THERE'S NOT FUNDING TO

02:24:58.122 --> 02:24:59.390
PAY THAT COORDINATOR.

02:24:59.457 --> 02:25:01.192
AND SO THERE'S NOT SOMEBODY WHO

02:25:01.259 --> 02:25:03.294
CAN FACILITATE ALL THAT TO WORK

02:25:03.361 --> 02:25:05.229
WITH ALL THE VOLUNTEERS TO BE

02:25:05.296 --> 02:25:07.665
WRITING THE GRANTS TO BE DOING

02:25:07.732 --> 02:25:08.499
THE PERMITTING ALL THAT KIND OF

02:25:08.566 --> 02:25:09.233
THING.

02:25:09.300 --> 02:25:10.168
AND SO I THINK WE NEED BE LOOK

02:25:10.234 --> 02:25:12.403
AT HOW CAN WE GET APPROXIMATE

02:25:12.470 --> 02:25:12.970
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:25:13.037 --> 02:25:14.105
EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE AND WE
