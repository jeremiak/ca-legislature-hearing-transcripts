THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER KAMAGRA DAD. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR YOUR GERMAN MEMORY. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TO ADJOURN IN MEMORY OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR RUINING MY SUMMER IN OCTOBER. OF NINETEEN SIXTY SIX THAT'S WHEN THE BALTIMORE ORIOLES SWEPT THE LA DODGERS FOR GAME STRAIGHT IT WAS FRANK ROBINSON IN THE FOURTH INNING. OF THAT FOURTH GAME. WHO HIT THE ONLY RUN IN THAT GAME -- THE TOOK THE DODGERS DOWN TO DEFEAT. FRANK ROBINSON WAS A LEGENDARY BASEBALL PLAYER. A HALL OF FAMER A BARRIER BREAKER. AND A CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCATE. ROBINSON IS THE ONLY PERSON TO MOST VALUABLE PLAYER IN BOTH THE AMERICAN LEAGUE. AND THE NATIONAL LEAGUE IT'S AN AMAZING ACCOMPLISHMENT. HE WAS A TRAILBLAZER BOTH ON AND OFF THE FIELD AND WAS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN MANAGER. IN MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL. HE BEGAN HIS CAREER IN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE AND MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL QUICKLY GRADUATED TO THE MAJOR LEAGUES THREE YEARS LATER. STARTING A CAREER WITH THE CINCINNATI REDS. HE PLAYED FOR THE REDS FOR TEN YEARS DURING WHICH HE WON HIS FIRST MVP TROPHY. AND IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX THAT FATEFUL YEAR HE BEGAN PLAYING FOR THE BALTIMORE ORIOLES WHERE HE WOULD PLAY FOR SIX SEASONS HELPING THAT TEAM GET THE TO THE WORLD SERIES. FOUR TIMES OF WINNING IT TWICE OVER THOSE YEARS. ROBINSON WENT ON TO PLAY FOR THE DODGERS THE ANGELS AND THE INDIANS AND DURING HIS LAST YEAR WITH THE INDIANS ROBINSON TOOK ON THE ROLE OF BOTH PLAYER. AND MANAGER BECOMING THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN MANAGER OF A MAJOR LEAGUE TEAM AS I MENTIONED EARLIER -- I'D LIKE TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT. OF BECOMING THE MANAGER OF A MAJOR LEAGUE TEAM. WAS THE FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENT OF BECOMING THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN CEO OF A MAJOR CORPORATION THIS IS A REALLY BIG DEAL -- AND YOU KNOW WE RIGHTFULLY LIONIZE JACKIE ROBINSON FOR BREAKING THE COLOR COLOR BARRIER IN BASEBALL BACK IN. NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN IT WAS TWENTY EIGHT YEARS LATER TALK ABOUT THE ARC OF JUSTICE -- IT MOVES INCREDIBLY SLOWLY SOMETIMES IT TOOK TWENTY EIGHT YEARS FOR THERE TO BE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MANAGER MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL -- AND THAT WAS FRANK ROBINSON. HE MANAGED DOUG HAD A LONG CAREER MANAGING TEAMS INCLUDING THE SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS THE BALTIMORE ORIOLES IN THE MONTREAL EXPOS. HE WAS KNOWN TO BE A SKILLED FOCUSED AND INTENSELY COMPETITIVE PLAYER AND AT THE TIME OF RETIREMENT. HE HAD THE FOURTH HIGHEST NOTE FOR AND THIS IS FROM THE FIELD -- HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE FIELD HE HAVE THE FOURTH -- HOME RUNS AND ALMOST THREE THOUSAND HITS. ROBINSON WAS INDUCTED INTO THAT -- NATIONAL BASEBALL HALL OF FAME IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO ON THE FIRST BALLOT IN HIS FIRST YEAR OF ELIGIBILITY ANOTHER BIG DEAL. A AND HE ALSO RECEIVED THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM IN. TWO THOUSAND FIVE HE PASSED AWAY ON FEBRUARY SEVENTH AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY THREE AND IS SURVIVED. BY HIS WIFE BARBARA AND COAL HIS SON FRANK AND HIS DAUGHTER TO SHELL AND I US THAT WE HAD TURNED IN HIS MEMORY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THIS ADJOURNMENT A MEMORY. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I ALSO RISE TO ADJOURN IN THE MEMORY OF FRANK ROBINSON WHO PASSED AWAY. ONE WEEK AGO AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY THREE FRANK ROBINSON WAS THAT TRUE TRAILBLAZER ON THE BASEBALL FIELD AND A TRUE INSPIRATION TO THE COMMUNITY OF OAKLAND. FRANK ROBINSON ATTENDED WEST OAKLAND'S CLIMB IN HIGH SCHOOL. HE ONCE JOKED THAT HIS QUICKNESS CAME FROM BEING ONE OF TEN KIDS. IF YOU WEREN'T QUICK YOU DIDN'T EAT HE SAID. GROWING UP ON MYRTLE STREET WEST OAKLAND HIS FAMILY STRUGGLE. TO MAKE ENDS MEET. IN FACT NEVER OWNED HIS OWN BASEBALL GLOVE UNTIL HE WAS. FOURTEEN FRANK ROBINSON WAS A TOUGH AND RESILIENT PLAYER. HE CREDITED THAT STRENGTH TO GOING ON FALL IN OAKLAND. HIS INDUCTION INTO THE BASEBALL HALL OF FAME HE TOLD THE STORY OF SLIDING INTO SECOND BASE. AND TEARING HIS PAT LAKE. YOU CAME HOME IN HIS MOTHER WAS DISTRESSED BY HIS TORN CLOSE BUT HE SAID. THAT SLIDING HARD WAS JUST HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED. NOTABLY IN THOSE DAYS FRANK WAS PLAIN ON AN ASPHALT BASEBALL FIELD. RIPS IN THE SCRAPES ARE WHAT MADE FRANK ROBINSON LEGENDARY PLAYER. AND MANAGER. HE GREW TO BE. IT ALSO HELPED HIM OVERCOME STRUGGLES THAT CONTINUED WELL INTO HIS PROFESSIONAL CAREER. FRANK ROBINSON WAS ONE OF THE LEAGUE'S MOST OUTSPOKEN PLAYERS ON A VARIETY OF RACIAL JUSTICE ISSUES. AMONG THEM THE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR WHITE PITCHERS WHO THREW IT AT BLACK HITTERS. SOMETHING HE KNEW ABOUT ALL TO WELL. BEING ON THE RECEIVING END A HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT TIMES. THE SAME YEAR HE WAS NAMED MOST VALUABLE PLAYER HE WAS ALSO TURNED AWAY BECAUSE OF HIS RACE WHEN HE TRIED. TO BUY A HOUSE. HE WAS STOPPED AT THE DOOR OF A PARTY CELEBRATING HIS TEAM'S PENNANT WHEN BECAUSE OF A QUOTE NO NEGROES ALLOWED AND QUOTE SIGN. STILL FRANK ROBINSON PERSEVERED AND NEVER LET IS OBSTACLES TO TURN HIM. FROM BECOMING ONE OF THE GREATEST PLAYERS IN THE HISTORY OF BASEBALL. HE WAS TRULY ONE OF A KIND. THE SPIRIT OF WHAT MAKES OAKLAND GREAT AND HIS POWERFUL LEGACY EVER LET AS THE TERMINATION. STRENGTH OF CHARACTER AND INDOMITABLE WILL WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE ON AS WE CONTINUE OUR FIGHT FOR A MORE JUST AND MORE FAIR SOCIETY. THAT WAS SPEAKER MEMBERS ASKED THAT WE ADJOURN IN MEMORY OF AND IN SINCERE GRATITUDE TO FRANK ROBINSON. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY WERE ALSO RECOGNIZED FOR THIS A GERMAN A MEMORY THANK YOU I ALSO WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE PASSING OF FRANK ROBINSON. I WITH A HEAVY HEART WE TALK ABOUT HIM TODAY OUR MEMBERS THAT YOUNG BOY MY DAD LIVED IN OAKLAND. AND I WAS TOLD ABOUT HIS OAKLAND HISTORY IT'S AMAZING THAT ONE HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL TEAM HAD -- THREE FUTURE MAJOR LEAGUERS FRANK ROB AND CURT FLOOD AND HE WAS THE HEART OF OAKLAND AND OF COURSE HE WAS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN MANAGER I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS WE CELEBRATE. BLACK HISTORY MONTH HERE IN FEBRUARY AND HE REALLY IS ONE OF THOSE UNSUNG HEROES WHO WHO MADE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE. IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA SAID HE LEFT HIS MARK ON THE BASEBALL FIELD MVP. IN TWO LEAGUES WON THE TRIPLE CROWN A FIRST BALLOT HALL OF FAMER THE FIRST AT THE TIME -- BUT ALSO HE LEFT HIS MARK IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA BECAUSE IN THE IN THE IN THE SIXTIES. AND FRANKLY IN THE FIFTIES AND AND THAT AREA WAS HARD FOR ATHLETES TO STEP UP AND THEY WERE ALL THERE OFTEN LOOKED DOWN UPON IN THE AIR THAT WE SEE THAT COLIN KAEPERNICK MOVEMENTS OF TODAY. HE STOPPED UP AND LEANED IN AND SAID WHAT WAS WRONG WHEN HE TRIED TO BUY A HOUSE. IN BALTIMORE AFTER IS TRADED IN HE AND HIS WIFE WERE TURNED DOWN BECAUSE OF A RED LINING POLICIES AND HE SAID THAT HE WANTED TO COME OUT. OF JUST COMPLAINING BUT STEP UP AND JOIN THE LOCAL AND DOUBLE ACP SPEAK OUT AS FAR AS THE INJUSTICES THAT HE FELT HE HAD AN OBLIGATION -- HE REMEMBER THE OBLIGATION BECAUSE HE CAME INTO. THE MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL BUSINESS A FEW YEARS AFTER JACKIE ROBINSON NO RELATION BUT HE REMEMBERED BUT JACKIE ROBINSON TALKED ABOUT WHEN HE FIRST WAS A PLAYER. AND THE IMPACT IT WOULD HAVE ON FUTURE PLAYERS AS WELL AND HE HAD AN OBLIGATION TO TO LEAD A STANDARD THAT REALLY HELPS THOSE BEHIND HIM. SO WHEN HE WAS ABLE TO BECOME A MAN IN THE MID SEVENTIES HE REMEMBER THAT AND KNEW THAT HOW HE ACTED UPON THIS JOB WOULD CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE BEHIND THEM. AND HE TOOK HIS JOB FOR THE CLEVELAND INDIANS AND THE CLIP ANY IT SAYS WE WILL GIVE YOU TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE TO BECOME A MANAGER. WHICH WAS LAUGHABLE COMPARED TO WHAT OTHER MANAGERS MADE WHO HAD THE SAME JOB BUT HE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS I WILL TAKE THIS JOB AS A PLAYER COACH. FOR JUST AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND HE'S CERTAINLY LEFT ITS MARK -- OTHER BLACK MANAGERS CAME CAME AFTER HIM HE WAS -- RECOGNIZED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM AND AS HE WAS -- WINDING DOWN IN HIS -- HEALTH IN -- IN YOUR DISTRICT. HE DECIDED HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL DONATIONS AND MEMORIES -- WENT TO SOMETHING THAT WOULD FOCUS ON HIS LEGACY SO HE ASKED AT ALL -- DONATIONS AND END UP IN LIEU EFFORTS GO TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS MUSEUM IN WASHINGTON AND ALSO IN MEMPHIS TO FOCUS ON THE EFFORTS OF PEOPLE LIKE HIM.
