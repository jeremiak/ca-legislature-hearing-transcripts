WELL GOOD MORNING A WELCOME TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT. TODAY WE HAVE A SPECIAL HEARING. I'M FOCUS ON DIVERSITY AND TECH AND HOW DO WE INCREASE. DIVERSITY IN TECH HOW DO WE. ARE CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND THOSE WHO DID HISTORICALLY. DISADVANTAGE TO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO BE A PART OF INNOVATION. I HAVE THE CHANCE TO EARN DECENT WAGES AND TO CONTRIBUTE ARE TO THE THINGS THAT. THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR HAS PROVIDED FOR US. ARE THIS HEARING LARGELY GROWS OUT OF CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE. OF ACROSS A NUMBER OF CAUCUSES HERE INCLUDING. A LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. TO EXPRESS CONCERNS ABOUT THE NEED TO DO MORE TO DIVERSIFY THE SECTOR. ABOUT FORTY HERE FROM MY COLLEAGUE. CHAIR OF THE BLACK CAUCUS IN JUST A MOMENT WHO HAVE SOME REMARKS. IF HE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE AND WE THANK HIM FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. ON THE SUBJECT OF. THEIR BEEN INVITATIONS TO EVERY CAUCUS AND EVERY ETHNIC CAUCUS AND EVERY CAUCUS OF CONCERN TO BE A PART. TODAY'S CONVERSATION. WE'VE ASKED EVERYONE. I THINK ABOUT. ONE KEY THING. WHAT ARE SOLUTIONS? TODAY'S MEETING IS NOT ABOUT BLAME BUT WE ARE GONNA HAVE HARD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT ARE THE FACTS. WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE CHANGES. AND TO INCREASE DIVERSITY AND TECH. I'LL IN THAT RESPECT. I'VE ALSO CONVENE A WORKING GROUP THAT IS FOCUSED ON CREATING. STRATEGIES AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO. INCREASED DIVERSITY IN TECH OF THE WORKING GROUP IS MADE UP OF. TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IT OUT AND I'M VERY THANKFUL THIS BUT AT LEAST A DOZEN. TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN LEADERS HAVE ALREADY STEPPED UP. EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS. BOTH IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR AND INDICATE TWELVE SECTOR. GOVERNMENT LEADERS OTHER EDUCATION LEADERS AND ADVOCATES ALL WHO ARE FOCUSED ON. WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO INCREASE OF OUR REPRESENTATION IN TECHNOLOGY AND SO IS OUR AND WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THE WORKING GROUP AS THIS HEARING TAKES PLACE TODAY? A BUT I WANT TO LAY OUT A FRAMEWORK OF WHERE WE HOPE TO GO. AND WE HOPE TO HAPPEN TODAY TODAY'S A BUSY DAY IN THE CAPITAL MANY MANY HEARINGS AND SO MEMBERS WILL BE COMING IN AND OUT. ARE AS THEY ARE ABLE TO. BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE FRUITFUL CONVERSATION WE HAVE SOME GREAT PANELS FOR YOU AND THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO GET UNDER WAY WITH THAT SAID. I WELCOME AND I LIKE TURN IT OVER TO. CHAIR OF THE COSTLY LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHRIS HOLDEN. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. THIS IS CERTAINLY A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO. BRING SOME ADDITIONAL FOCUS TO AN AREA THAT HAS BEEN. A ONE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE BEEN WORKING ON IT LIKE TO THINK A TECHNO AND. OF THEIR. MEMBER COMPANIES FOR OF BEING A PART OF THE CONVERSATION THE DIALOGUE OVER THE LAST YEAR PLUS. AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR LATER LEADERSHIP. AND THE ABILITY TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF LABOR. IT'S VERY FITTING. YOU. WORKING GROUP A TO HELP BRNG ADDITIONAL FOCUS TO THE ISSUE I THINK IS RIGHT ON TIME OF THE BLACK CAUCUS HAS BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE AND. HAS. A GOOD ADDRESSING IT AND TRYING TO WORK MOVE THE BALL DOWN THE FIELD IF YOU WILL. OFFER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND SO. I LET ME JUST TO SAY THAT AS THE CHAIR. OF THE CBC. I'D LIKE TO. AGAIN THANK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE BECAUSE THIS CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DIALOGUE TO CONTINUE AS THE CHAIRMAN HAS SAID. OF FOR US TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE ADVANCES AND TECHNOLOGY. THE PROGRESS EVERY ASPECT OF OUR SOCIETY. SPURS ACHIEVEMENT. AND ALL OTHER INDUSTRIES INCLUDING HEALTHCARE EDUCATION AND EVEN GOVERNMENT. THEREFORE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY IS IMPERATIVE. FOR THESE CONCEPTS TO PERMEATE THROUGHOUT OUR SOCIETY AS THE TECH INDUSTRY LEADS THE WAY. AND SETS THE COURSE FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD TO FOLLOW. ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK AT CALIFORNIA IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT HOW GOES CALIFORNIA SO GOES THE NATION. AS INDUSTRY GROWS WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE FUTURE OF OUR COMMUNITY ALSO AUTHORIZES OUR WORLD BECOMES MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED. HOWEVER IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE NEED EVERYONE'S HELP INCLUDING THE TOP TECH COMPANIES SPECIFICALLY THOSE IN LEADERSHIP. TRUE INITIATIVES FOR MORE INCLUSIVE WORKFORCE REQUIRES EXECUTIVE BOARD OF THESE COMPANIES AND MAKE DIVERSITY A TOP PRIORITY. THIS IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY TO LEARN WHAT PRACTICES AND PROGRAMS ARE EMPLOYED AT THESE COMPANIES. TO ADVANCE OUR SOCIETY SPECIFICALLY THOSE WHO ARE UNDER REPRESENTED. AND THE SAN FRANCISCO GATE. NEWS ARTICLE IT IS STATED AND WE DO HAVE THAT I DON'T KNOW ALL OF YOU HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO SEE IT BUT WE HAVE IN THE BACK SO YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THAT. ARTICLE. IT IS STATUS DISCRIMINATION HIS THE OVER ARCHING BECAUSE OF DISPROPORTIONATE RATES REPRESENTATION AND HIGH PAIN FEELS. GAINES ARE ELUSIVE FOR MYRIAD OF REASONS. SUBSTANDARD SCHOOLS IN LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS WHITE DOMINATED OFFICE CLICKS BOARD ROOMS THEY PREFER FAMILIARITY TO DIVERSITY. DISCRIMINATORY HIRING PRACTICES COMPANIES THAT CLAIM A LACK OF QUALIFIED CANDIDATES BUT HAVE NO PROBLEMS. TRAIN MINORITY TALENT. QUESTIONS I WOULD HOPE. TO HAVE ANSWERS TO HERE TODAY INCLUDE. WHAT DOES THE OUT REACH CONSISTS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS DO NOT ATTEND HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES? WE'VE HEARD THAT THERE IS OUT REACH TO HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND WOULD LIKE TO KNOW BEYOND THE. HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES WHAT IS THE OUTREACH. WHAT TYPE OF INCLUSIVE AREA INCLUSIONARY PRACTICES YOU USE IN THE HIRING PROCESS? WORD RETENTION PROGRAMS AND ADVANCEMENT IN TACK ARE READILY AVAILABLE FOR THOSE AT YOUR INSTITUTIONS. HOW DO YOU PLAN TO DIVERSIFY CORPORATE BOARDS WHEN THOSE WHO ARE APPOINTED SERVE ON MULTIPLE BOARDS LIMITING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FRESH FACES IN THE BOARD ROOM? WHAT ARE THE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE GENERAL PROFILE OF THOSE ELECTED TO SERVE ON YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND HOW DOES YOUR COMPANY DEMONSTRATE DIVERSITY AT THE TOP? THERE IS MUCH TALK ABOUT PIPELINE CREATION BUT HOW HAS YOUR COMPANY INVESTED IN THE PIPELINE FROM OUR COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. TO THE TECH WORLD. SPECIFICALLY SIXTY PERCENT OF THE NATION'S STUDENTS WHO BEGAN HIGH SCHOOL INTERESTED IN STEM LOSE INTEREST BEFORE GRADUATION WITH LACK OF DIVERSE EXPOSURE OPPORTUNITIES AMONG THE TOP CAUSES. WHERE MOST OF YOUR PROGRAMS GEARED TOWARDS MIDDLE SCHOOLERS? I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF HIRING THE MOST QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL FOR JOBS. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE ARE MANY QUALIFIED PERSONS TO FILL THESE TECHNICAL ROLES YET THERE ARE A LARGE DISCREPANCIES IN THEM BEING HIRED. I APPRECIATE EACH OF YOU BEING HERE TODAY TO SHARE WITH US SOME OF YOUR PRACTICES AND PROPOSALS FOR HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. AND DIVERSIFY THE TECH INDUSTRY. THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN HOLDEN AND TO YOUR POINTS TODAY. WE WILL HEAR FROM. THREE CEOS OF COMPANIES. AS WELL AS FROM SOME VERY HIGH LEVEL COMPANY REPRESENTATIVES. AS I MENTION OUR WORK GROUP WILL BE FOCUS ON. A MATCHING APPLICANTS WITH JOBS AS WELL AS HOW DO YOU USE THE PIPELINE OF STUDENTS WHO ARE PREPARED. A FOR THE FUTURE OF WORK FOR TECHNOLOGY OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FUTURE. OUT WE'RE HONORED. TO BE JOINED BY A COLLEAGUE FROM SENATE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LATINO CAUCUS AND HE HAS BEEN. ALSO A LEADER IN THE SUBJECT OF HOW WE INCREASE. DIVERSITY AND TACK ON WOULD WELCOME SENATOR HUESO IF HE WISHES TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS HERE BUT THIS IS A STORE WE DON'T GET SENATORS IN THE ASSEMBLY SO. WELL THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT MAKING HISTORY RIGHT AS COME HERE MAKE HISTORY PUTS OUT MORE MORE IMPORTANTLY JUST TO THANK YOU FOR HOSTING. THIS ARE VERY IMPORTANT. A COMMITTEE A HEARING. AND FORGET INPUT FROM. MEMBERS OF OUR PARTICULATE AIR WANT TO THANK THEM FOR BEING HERE. AND AND BE AN ACCESSIBLE AND BIG BEEN WILLING TO DO THIS. THERE THERE. THERE HAS BEEN. SEE CRITICISM OF NOT ONLY OF THAT INDUSTRY BUT OF. OTHERS ACROSS THE STATE. AND WE WE DID. RESOLUTION YESTERDAY AND SENATE. CELEBRATING A STEM BUT ALSO TALKING ABOUT INCREASING DIVERSITY. IN A IN. YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE HIGH TECH FIELDS. IT WE HAVE WE HAVE SOME CHALLENGES IN OUR STATE. WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT AND THAT THE NUMBERS ARE VERY LOW. FOR LATINO AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN. HOW OLD THE MINORITY GROUPS ALTHOUGH CHALLENGE GROUPS? ARE HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING ACCESS TO OF THESE INDUSTRIES. THERE ARE SOME WONDERFUL PROGRAMS OUT THERE THAT WE CAN DEFINITELY. CELEBRATE BUT A LOT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. YOUNG PEOPLE EMULATE THE ROLE MODELS. AND IF YOU COME FROM A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY AND YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A. OF A ROLE MODEL THAT IS. IN THE HIGH TECH FIELD OR IS A DOCTOR OR A BANK OR COMES FROM A. OF. OF A VERY EDUCATED FIELD. YOU'RE YOUR YOUR ROLE MODEL SEARCH SEVERELY LIMITED ELIMINATE LIMITED. AND THAT. ALL HAS A LIMITING AFFECTING YOUR POTENTIAL BECAUSE IN YOUR MIND. IT AFFECTS YOUR YOUR YOUR STATE OF OF OF. AWARENESS AND YOUR STATE OF MIND AND YOUR CONFIDENCE SO THESE ARE THINGS THAT. THERE THERE ARE SOME WONDERFUL PROGRAMS GROW PROGRAMS OUT THERE THEY'RE GETTING KIDS INTO THE WORK TECH ENVIRONMENT. AND AND INTERNSHIP MAKING INTERNSHIPS AVAILABLE BUT WE. WE REALLY NEED TO. DIVERSIFY IMPORTANT AREAS OF OF OUR ECONOMY BECAUSE THEY WILL ONLY MAKE THEM MORE PRODUCTIVE AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT. AND WERE THE GOAL THAT THAT THIS-LEGISLATURE SHOULD FOLK FOCUS ON. AND SO I WONDER WHAT REALLY ONE THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS AND AND GIVEN US THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THIS INFORMATION BUT ALSO. MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND LET THEM KNOW THAT. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AREA THAT DESERVES OUR ATTENTION AND EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE. THE ABILITY TO SPIRE TO ANYTHING THEY WANTED TO IN THE STATE WE SHOULD. MAKE THOSE FIELDS. AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE THAT THEY WANT TO ENTER THEM. AS MUCH AS WE CAN IT'S SAD. OF THAT WE'VE HAD. YEARS OF LEGISLATION PRIOR TO US GETTING HERE PROP TWO ONE NINE. AND OTHER DISCRIMINATORY POLICIES THAT REALLY CAUGHT THE PATHWAY TO CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS. OBTAINING. ADMISSION TO OUR UNIVERSITIES AND. A OBTAINING OUR. YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS IN THE JUST SO MANY THINGS THAT WERE DONE THAT WE. WE NEED TO WORK TO TO UNDO. MAN AND SOMETIMES IT'S EASIER SAID THAN DONE GIVEN THE CHALLENGES OF ADDING THOSE. IT WAS BUILT THOSE LAWS TO THE CONSTITUTION THE WAY THEY'VE BEEN DONE. THROUGH VOTER APPROVAL. AND WE GOT IT WE BETTER FIND WAYS. CHU CHU. MAKE THE STATE MARKS US WILL TO ALL THE PEOPLE. STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR IMPORTANT WORK THANK YOU CHAIRMAN HUESO FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TENURE LEADERSHIP. I'M ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE MY COLLEAGUE WHO IS A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN A CHAMPION ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND REALLY CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE THAT HE'S BEEN COMMITTED. TO THE SUBJECT OF DIVERSITY IN TECH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALLED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OF FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. CENTER. FOR YOUR COMMENTS FOR BEING HERE WITH US. AND YOU KNOW REPRESENTS HOUSING CAPITAL SILICON VALLEY IS NO DOUBT THAT. NOTE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO WE CAN TO ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT OUR TECH SECTOR. NOT JUST SILICON VALLEY BUT IN THE STATE OF I THINK THERE BE ARE. THE LEADERS IN TERMS OF THE INNOVATION ECONOMY AND AND WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THAT. I ALSO REPRESENT. THE POOREST CENSUS TRACKS AND SLOGAN VALLEY IN SAN JOSE AND THE SAN JOSE. A WORK KIDS LIVING IN THE SHADOWS OF SOME OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ABOUT HIS COMPANIES IN THE FACE OF THE EARTH. A COULD NEVER EVEN IMAGINE WALKING THROUGH THOSE DOORS. AND I KNOW. THAT AS SENATOR HUESO INDICATE IT'S NOT JUST TACK IT YOU KNOW THESE ISSUES PROCESSED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. BUT I THINK TECH. HOLD A SOFT A HIGHER STANDARD I AM NOT THAT'S A GOOD THING THAT THEY DO. THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD HOW DO WE GET TO A PLACE WHERE. WE CAN START TO REALLY MAKE SIGNIFICANT. OVEN APPROVED AND ROADS IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT WE'RE GETTING MORE DIVERSITY MORE INCLUSION I THINK SOUTHERN BEEN SOME SUCCESSFUL I'M SURE WE'LL HEAR FROM SOME OF THAT PROGRAMS BUT. I AS A SANDERS SAID OF THIS CONVERSATION'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR FAR TOO LONG WITHOUT. THE REAL IMPACTS I THINK THAT WE CERTAINLY DID LIKE I'VE TO SEE HAPPEN. IF YOU GO TO ESE SALAS A SITE UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU HAVE YOUR PIPELINE RIGHT THERE. AND THE PIPELINE IS READY TO BE THE NEXT GENERATION OF ENGINEERS OF. OF MARKETING EXPERTS I'VE YOU NAME IT. THEY'RE THERE AND THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE TOO EAGER TO LEARN AND SO I DIE AND YOU CAN REPLICATE THAT SAME THING WHETHER IT'S IN LA SAN DIEGO THROUGHOUT THE CITY CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE TALENT BASE IN OUR SCHOOLS. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THEY HAD THAT OPPORTUNITY PARTICULARLY PEOPLE COLOR WOMEN UP FOR THOSE REALLY OF OF? INNOVATIVE AND A WELL PAYING AND. REALLY THOUGHT PROVOKING ATTACK JOBS SUB THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING. THANK YOU SO INNER KALRA AND FOR POINTING TO YOUR DISTRICT FOR PROVIDING THE PIPELINE OF THE FUTURE AND INACTION. YEAH WILL FOLLOW YOUR LEAD WILL FOLLOW YOUR LEAD YOU'RE RIGHT THIS IS. WE KNOW HOW WE KNOW HOW TO INNOVATE WE KNOW HOW TO. AND HELP THOSE WHO WANT TO ENTER THE PROFESSION TO GET THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO GET THERE AND IT'S UPON US. TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN AND I SHOULD SAY THAT THIS IS A RESPONSIBILITY OF THE TECH SECTOR. AND GOVERNMENT AND ADVOCATES WORKING TOGETHER AND SO WE THANK. TECHNET PARTNERS AND THOSE WHO COME HERE TODAY ASSEMBLED ON SHORT NOTICE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE GONNA DO ABOUT IT. SO HAVING SAID THAT LET'S JUST GET TO IT. YOU KNOW YOU CAN TALK ALL DAY BUT IT'S TIME FOR ACTION. I'M EXCITED TO BRING FORWARD OUR OUR FIRST PANELIST. TO HELP US FRAME THE ISSUE. REPRESENTING. WOMEN ATTACK. AND THE CLAIM INSTITUTE AT STANFORD A DOCTOR JOANNE WEHNER. AND TO TALK ABOUT UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES INTACT. MICHELLE FLOWERS TAYLOR FROM USC WOULD WELCOME YOU TO COME TO OUR. PANELISTS TABLE. AND YOU KNOW. I KNOW THEY TOLD YOU TO TALK FOR A LONG TIME YOU KNOW THE WAY WE TRY TO DO THESE IS REALLY JUST TWO TO THREE MINUTES OF REALLY HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF KEYS. POINT SO THAT WE LEAVE TIED FOR THE QUESTIONS AND MAKE THAT THE THAT. THE HEART OF THE TIME. YOU KNOW I THINK OUR MISSION TODAY AS WE TALK ABOUT WHAT'S WORKING LET'S BE STRAIGHT BASE. ARM WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS AND HOW TO GET PAST THEM. AND THEN WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE NEED TO CARRY OUT AND SO. WE LOOK FOR WHAT YOU HAVE PREPARED FOR US. AND. WELCOME YOU WHEN YOU ARE READY. DOT WHEN. THANK YOU CHAIRING COMMITTEE FOR GIVING ME THE CHANCE TO TODAY AND JOB PRESENT SOME OF THE RESEARCH WE'RE DOING AT THE CLAIM INSTITUTE. AT STANFORD ON WOMEN IN TACK. I. MY NAME IS A EVEN IF THE STATE WAS ABLE TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WOMEN. EARNING CS DEGREES IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WAS HIRED IN SILICON VALLEY TECH COMPANIES. TOMORROW IT WOULD NOT SOLVE THE LARGER MORE DEEPLY ENTRENCHED PROBLEM OF STRUCTURAL INEQUALITY. THAT IS BUILT INTO THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT SERVES TO LIMIT WOMEN'S OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THESE COMPANIES. AS WELL AS DRIVE THEM OUT OF THE FIELD ALTOGETHER. ABOUT TECHNICAL WOMEN AND. THERE'S ALWAYS AN ASSUMPTION THAT ONCE THESE WOMEN ARE HIRED AT AND FEW LEVEL POSITIONS THEY'RE GOING TOOF COURSE BE HAPPY WORKING FOR TECH COMPANIES. THAT THEY'RE GONNA THRIVE THERE WANT TO STAY AND THEY'LL BE PROMOTED INTO LEADERSHIP AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT THIS PROBLEM WILL NO LONGER EXIST. HOWEVER THIS ISN'T A SUCH A FALSE ASSUMPTION THAT RESEARCH JUSTICE NOT SUBSIDE PORT. WEEBLY BELIEVE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY THE BIASES THAT ARE BUT BUILT BAKED INTO WORKPLACES AT TECH COMPANIES THAT SERVE TO AMPLIFY BIAS. AND REINFORCE THE LACK OF WOMEN IN TACT YEAR AFTER YEAR. IN TWENTY SECOND SIXTEEN DATA FOUND THAT WOMEN MAKE UP ABOUT TWENTY SIX PERCENT OF ALL COMPUTING OCCUPATIONS. AND THIS IS A DROP FROM EARLY NINETIES DATA THAT SHOWS THAT WOMEN WERE ABOUT THIRTY SIX PERCENT SO THERE'S A DROP IN WOMEN'S REPRESENTATION INTACT. THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETIES WHEREAS IT'S BEEN AN INCREASE IN OTHER FIELDS. WHAT WE LOOK FOR SPECIFIC DATA ON TACK I IN THE SILICON VALLEY? THAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE NOT REALLY READILY AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY'RE GENERALLY VOLUNTARILY GIVEN. BUT. OR REQUIRED BY E. OC BUT SPECIFIC COMPANIES SUCH AS GOOGLE OR FACEBOOK MICROSOFT TWITTER EXCEDRIN. OFTEN VOLUNTARILY REPORT OF THEIR GENDER AND OTHER DIVERSITY METRICS AND WOMEN MAKE UP ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TO CLOSE TO FIFTY PERCENT OF THEIR OVERALL WORK FORCE. YET THE ONLY HOLD BETWEEN FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF TECHNICAL ROLES. WITHIN THESE COMPANIES AND WOMEN HOLD BETWEEN EIGHTEEN PERCENT AND THIRTY PERCENT OF LEADERSHIP ROLE THAT THESE COMPANIES. TWENTY SEVENTEEN RESEARCH BY ANITA BORG A IT'S THE THREE SILICON VALLEY TECH COMPANIES FOUND THAT THE BIGGEST AREA OF GROWTH FOR WOMEN INTACT WITHOUT THE ENTRY LEVEL SO IT WAS TWENTY TWO PERCENT AND TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND THAT RISEN TO TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. SUGGESTING THE PIPELINE IS IN FACT IMPROVING. BUT AS IS OFTEN THE CASE WOMEN CONTINUE TO BE UNDER REPRESENTED AT THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE LEVELS. CONSISTING OF NINETEEN PERCENT AND FIFTEEN PERCENT RESPECTIVELY AND THIS IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THE BEST WAY FOR WOMEN TO INFLUENCE THE CULTURE OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS. AND TECH MORE BROADLY IS BY INCREASING THE REPRESENTATION IN LEADERSHIP. EVEN MORE SURPRISING IS THAT WOMEN WORKING IN TECH COMPANIES LEAVES AT TWICE THE RATE OF THEIR MALE COLLEAGUES. FORTY ONE PERCENT OF WOMEN WILL LEAVE TECH AT MID CAREER COMPARED TO ONLY SEVENTEEN PERCENT OF MEN. THE RATE OF FEMALE ATTRITION AND TECH IS HIGHER THANOTHER STEM FIELDS SO IT'S NOT SIMPLY SOMETHING THAT ALL SCIENCES SUFFER FROM BUT SOMETHING ABOUT TECH IN PARTICULAR. MANY QUALITATIVE STUDIES SUGGEST THAT MANY WOMEN DON'T FEEL WELCOME OR INCLUDED IN TACK WE'VE HEARD FROM MALE MANAGERS WHOSE ALL MAIL ME MALE ENGINEERING TEAMS WILL SAY THEY SPECIFICALLY DO NOT WANT TO HIRE WOMEN ONTO THEIR TEAMS. AS THEY SERVICE A BUZZ KILL OR AS ONE WOMAN I HEARD FROM IN A FOCUS GROUP STATED SHE COULD CARE LESS ABOUT THE TRADITIONAL BENEFITS. THAT ARE OFFERED AT TECH COMPANIES SUCH AS GO CARTS ARE PING PONG TABLES AND INSTEAD WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT MATERNITY LEAVE AND LACTATION ROOMS. SO WHAT CAN BE DONE IN OUR WORK WITH ACTUAL TECH COMPANIES WERE TESTING A CHANGE MODEL THAT'S FOCUSED ON A SMALL WINS APPROACH. THAT MEANS RATHER THAN ENCOURAGING LARGE SCALE DENY INITIATIVES WE RECOMMEND THAT COMPANIES. START OFF SMALL RUNNING TEAM BASED INTERVENTIONS DESIGNED TO DISRUPT THE BIASES THAT ARE HURTING WOMEN AND OTHER UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS. R. CHANGE MODEL IS FAIRLY SIMPLE STARTING OFF TO WORK WITH TEAMS OF MANAGERS TO CO DEVELOP TOOLS DESIGNED TO REDUCE BIAS. IN SPECIFIC EVALUATIVE PROCESS HE'S SUCH AS HIRING PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS OUR TALENT ABUSING CALIBRATIONS. PLACES WHERE DIAL WOMEN AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES TEND TO GET LOWER RATINGS AND THEN THAT IN TURN HURTS THEIR CHANCES OF MOVING UP THE LADDER. FIRST MANAGERS NEED TO BE EGGED EDUCATED ON STEREOTYPES AND UNCONSCIOUS BIAS SO THEY CAN RECOGNIZE BIAS AND AVOID BUILDING IT INTO NEW TOOLS AND PROPHECIES. SECOND ORGANIZATIONS IN NEED TO ANALYZE THEIR DIVERSE CITY DATA MANY COMPANIES WE TALKED TO DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE WOMEN WERE UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS ARE FALLING OUT OF THEIR PIPELINE. THEY DON'T KNOW AT WHAT LEVEL WOMEN ARE STE. THE RIGHT HAVING SERIOUS RETENTION PROBLEMS SO WE REALLY TOUGH ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS OF THE NEED TO KNOW WHERE WOMEN AND UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS. ARE IN THEIR COMPANY WHERE THEY'RE FALLING OUT AND WHAT WHERE THEN THEY NEED TO MAKE THEIR CONCERTED EFFORTS ON DIVERSITY RATHER THAN TRYING TO DO. A SHOTGUN APPROACH. NEXT TO WORK OF MANAGERS TO THEN DEVELOP A TOOL THAT CAN SPEAK THE PROCESS WERE BIAS APPEARS TO BE IMPACTING OUTCOMES. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY HAVE UNCLEAR OR AMBIGUOUS CRITERIA AROUND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION. THAT IS LEADING TO MEN AND WOMEN BEING EVALUATED DIFFERENTLY. THAT. THEY CAN WE CAN WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE MUCH CLEARER CRITERIA THAT IS BET METRIC BASED RATHER THAN BASED ON. PEOPLE'S OPINIONS OF INDIVIDUALS OR THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF WHAT THAT INDIVIDUAL IS CAPABLE OF RATHER IT'S BASED ON HARD NUMBERS OR METRICS OF PERFORMANCE. THEN THIS INTERVENTION OCT AND TOOLS ARE STE DESIGNED TO SERVE AS A MEASURABLE CHANGE THAT MANAGERS CAN THEN SEE. AND BE ENCOURAGED BY IN THE HOPES THAT THEY'LL WANT TO DO MORE TO ROOT OUT BIAS IN THE ORGANIZATION AND CREATE BETTER PROPHECIES. FINALLY WE MEASURE THE SUCCESS OF THE CHANGE OR INTERVENTION OFTEN SHOWING MEN AND WOMEN SAY RECEIVING SIMILAR FEEDBACK OR SHRINKING THE SIGNIFICANT GENDER GAP IN PERFORMANCE RATINGS THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY EXISTED. AND THIS CAN GIVE MANAGERS A FEELING OF. EXCITEMENT AND FEELING THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY PRODUCE CHANGE UP THEIR COMPANY AND THEY MIGHT THEN WE HOPE THAT THEY'LL THEN IT TALK TO OTHER MANAGERS ABOUT THAT. INTRODUCE IT TO OTHER PROPHECIES AND THEN THAT WILL LEAD TO. A FEW CHANGES AT THE COMPANY FROM THESE INDIVIDUALS SHARING THEIR AYE. IDEAS BECAUSE IT ALSO DOESN'T RELY ON LEADERSHIP WHICH CHANGES A LOT SO IF YOU JUST HAVE ONE PERSON WHO'S COMMITTED TO THE PROBLEM. IF THAT PERSON LEAVES OFTENTIMES DIVERSITY FALLS TO THE WAYSIDE. IN OUR RECENT WORK WITH GO DADDY WE WORKED WITH THEIR EXECUTIVE LEADERS TO SIMPLIFY THEIR VALUES AND CREATE A SCORECARD THAT MANAGERS COULD USE WHEN MEETING IN CALIBRATING EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE. RATINGS THAT AFFECT PAY AND PROMOTION DECISIONS DEVELOPING THE SCORECARD REQUIRED CREATING MEASURABLE CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING EMPLOYEES THAT WERE ALIGNED WITH THE COMPANY'S VALUES. AND COULD BE APPLIED CONSISTENTLY ACROSS EMPLOYEES WE BELIEVE CONSISTENCY IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST WAYS MANAGERS CAN ENSURE THAT ALL EMPLOYEES REGARDLESS OF GENDER RACE ARE BEING EVALUATED AGAINST THE SAME CRITERIA. AND THAT'S ACTUALLY BEING IN THE MERITOCRACY THAT WE ALL WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN WITHIN TACK. THE USE OF THE SCORECARD PRODUCED IMMEDIATE REDUCTIONS IN THE GENDER GAP PREVIOUSLY FOUND IN PERFORMANCE RATINGS USED IN PROMOTION DECISIONS AND THIS TYPE OF A SMALL WHEN AS WE HAVE SHOWN CAN MOTIVATE FURTHER ACTIONS THAT LEAD TO LARGER ORGANIZATIONAL TRANSFORMATION. SUCH AS OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT THE COMPANY ADOPTING SIMILAR CRITERIA FOR THEIR EVALUATIONS. AS WELL AS MAKING A CONCERTED EFFORT TO HIGH MORE HIRE MORE WOMEN AMONG THEIR NEW ENGINEERING GRADUATE HIRES. THERE WERE MANY NAY SAYERS IN THE COMPANY AND LEADERS WHO NEEDED TO BE BROUGHT ALONG BUT IN THE END AS IS USUALLY THE CASE. PARTICIPATING LEADERS REPORTED FEELING THAT TAKING THOSE EXTRA FEW MINUTES TO CLARIFY CRITERIA. MADE THEM BETTER MANAGERS MADE THEM BETTER OF MORE MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT THEY WERE EVALUATING PEOPLE FAIRLY WHICH WAS THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL AS A MANAGER IN THE FIRST PLACE. WE'RE PROUD TO SHOW THAT THROUGH THOUGHTFUL AND MANAGEABLE CHANGE ACCOMPANY LIKE GO DADDY WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN BEEN KNOWN FOR ITS SEXIST TELEVISION COMMERCIALS. IS NOW INCLUDED ON LISTS OF THE BEST COMPANIES FOR WOMEN TO WORK FOR. THEREFORE AS AN INSTITUTE WE BELIEVE THAT CHANGE IS POSSIBLE BUT THE FOCUS NEEDS TO BE ON CREATING TRULY MERITOCRATIC STRUCTURES WERE ALL PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF GENDER. TRULY HAVE AN EQUAL CHANCE OF SUCCESS IT'S ONLY BY REDUCING THE AFFECTS OF BIAS IN THE STRUCTURES THAT TRUE CHANGE AND DIVERSITY IN TECH WILL OCCUR. THANK YOU DOCTOR WINNER. WOULD LIKE TO NOT HEAR FROM MS FLOWERS TAYLOR. HELLO GOOD MORNING. YES MY NAME IS DOCTOR MICHELLE FLOWERS TAYLOR. AND I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE FOR HOLDING THIS VERY IMPORTANT HEARING IT SO TIMELY AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU GUYS ARE ALL ON BOARDING COMMITTED TO REALLY MAKE AN IMPACT IN OUR BEAUTIFUL STATE. AYE CURRENTLY AND THE DIRECTOR OF AN INSTITUTE CALLED THE INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERING. COMMUNITY AND CULTURAL COMPETENCE WHICH IS BASED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN THE VITERBI SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING. AND THE WORK THAT I DO THERE WAS BORN OUT OF MY RESEARCH ON. ACADEMICALLY HIGH ACHIEVING AFRICAN AMERICAN FEMALE STUDENTS. BECAUSE OTHER SO MUCH RESEARCH ON WHAT'S NOT WORKING. WITHOUT POPULATION. BUT THERE IS SO MUCH THAT IS IN FACT WORKING AND SO I'VE NOW PARTLY MY RESEARCH TO WORKING IN THE ENGINEERING SCHOOL. TO PROVIDE OUTREACH TO MIDDLE SCHOOL GIRLS WHO ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINA. FROM UNDERSERVED LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND SOME HERE TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. SOME OF MY RESEARCH FINDINGS AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE. A SCENE WORKING SINCE WE WANTED USE AND HOT ASSET BASED APPROACH. FOR THIS CONVERSATION. INSIDE LIKE TO. HIGHLIGHT ONE ISSUE THAT IS OF CONCERN. AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED AND AS OTHER FOLKS HERE MENTIONED. A GROCER JUST AS. CAPABLE IN GIRLS AND WOMEN ARE JUST AS CAPABLE AND IN FACT MIDDLE SCHOOL GIRLS ARE JUST AS INTERESTED IN STEM AS BOYS ARE. BUT THERE TENDS TO BE A DROP OFF EIGHTH GRADE NINTH GRADE WHERE THEY JUST. GO FROM LIKING MATH LIKING SCIENCE LIKING TECHNOLOGY AND THEY LOSE ALL INTEREST. SO I HAVE SOME. PRESENTATION HERE TO SHARE WITH YOU. THERE ARE REALLY IN MY RESEARCH I FOUND THERE'S THREE REASONS WHY. THERE'S THIS DROP OFF. THE FIRST AND PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT REASONS IS. THE GIRLS FEEL AND EXPRESS A LACK OF. CONNECTION A LACK OF RELEVANCE TO THEIR DAILY LIVES. SURE THEY ALL HAVE IPHONES BUT THEY DON'T THEY MAY NOT SEE THE VALUE. OF HAVING THAT KNOWLEDGE THAT NOT ONLY CAN YOU BE A CONSUMER OF THAT IPHONE YOU CAN ALSO BE A PRODUCER TECHNOLOGY JUST LIKE THAT I. SO THAT'S A THAT'S A REAL ISSUE A LACK OF RELEVANCE. SECONDLY. IN THE RESEARCH IT STATES THAT. THERE'S A. THERE'S A REAL ISSUE AROUND GIRLS HAVING WHAT'S CALLED A FIXED MINDSET. WHERE THEY SAY I'M JUST NOT GOOD AT THAT I'M NOT GOOD AT MATH? AND A LOT OF THOSE FIX MINDSET CHARACTERISTICS ARE. DETERMINED BY STEREOTYPES AND GROWTH SUCCUMBING. TO THOSE STEREOTYPES GIRLS AND GIRLS OF COLOR IN PARTICULAR. ARE. ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE THAT MINDSET WHICH REALLY IS. SCOURGING AND CAN DISTRACT THEM FROM EVEN HAVING THAT. A. POSSIBLE SELF OR VIEW ABOUT POSSIBLE SELF AS BEING A TECHNOLOGIST SO THAT SECOND. AND THAT'S SOMETIMES SUPPORTED UNFORTUNATELY BY THEIR SCHOOL AN ACADEMIC SETTING. OKAY. AND THIRD THERE'S A LACK OF ACCESS TO HANDS ON OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPLORE. AND MAKE MISTAKES TINKER BUILD AGAIN. SO. AND AS MY. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN IN AS A RESEARCH OF MANY OTHER RESEARCH LIKE MY COLLEAGUE AND OTHERS HAVE SHOWN. I'M THERE'S WAYS TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY. TO BREAK DOWN SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES. AND ONE MODEL I WANNA HIGHLIGHT IS. PRODUCT OF MY RESEARCH. IT'S REALLY ABOUT BRINGING CONCEPTS TOGETHER THAT EXIST CURRENTLY IN THE AND THE RESEARCH BUT BRING IT TOGETHER FOR THE PURPOSE OF CREATING FEMALE STEM ENTREPRENEURS OF THE FUTURE. BASED ON NUMBER ONE ENCOURAGING IN FEMALE STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND AFFIRMS. FUND OF KNOWLEDGE. WHAT THAT MEANS IT COMES FROM ANTHROPOLOGY? BUT THE TERM MEANS. HELPING STUDENTS AFFIRM THEIR SOCIO CULTURAL THEIR LINGUISTIC BACKGROUNDS. WHAT THEY KNOW PLACING THEM IN THE ROLE OF EXPERTS? PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO STEM. BECAUSE THAT'S ONE VERY CLEAR WAY TO HELP THEM SEE THE RELEVANCE. OF STEM THE DIRECT RELEVANCE TO THEIR LIVES. AND SECONDLY INCREASING THEIR GROWTH MINDSET. SO THAT THEY CAN SEE I MAY NOT BE GOOD AT MATH RIGHT NOW. BUT HONESTLY WHOEVER WAS IN THE BEGINNING LIKE NO AND RIGHT. EVEN MATHEMATICIANS YOU NO I WORKING AT USC AND I MEET REALLY SMART FOLKS. AND THEY ARE LEADING INITIATIVES JUST LIKE MYSELF. IN MATH AND ENGINEERING IT'S ULTRA AND THEY DIDN'T GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT STRESSING THE VALUE A FAILURE. IN THE VALUE OF MAKING MISTAKES AND IT'S OKAY. AND THEN THIRD GIVING THEM HANDS ON OPPORTUNITIES TO TRY AND EXPLORE. BUT FIRST TO DO THIS WE HAVE TO MOVE FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE. AND WITHOUT IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO. ADDRESS THE NEEDS NOT ONLY OF THE CHILD'S BUT ALSO THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH THEY FIND THEMSELVES. AND THE FAMILY STRUCTURE. SO BY GIVING CONTENT PROVIDING CONTENT TO. THE YOUNG GIRLS THEMSELVES BUT ALSO ENGAGING THEIR PARENTS IN THAT PROCESS. TO CREATE A STEM FAMILY. SO IT'S COMPLETELY NORMAL. WE ALL SEE PARENTS GOING TO BASEBALL GAMES SOCCER GAMES. YOU KNOW WHY COULDN'T WE SEE MORE PARENTS SUPPORTING THESE ENGINEERING. CHAMPIONSHIPS YOU KNOW THESE MATH OLYMPICS JUST AT THE SAME LEVEL RIGHT. I AND SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU. A LITTLE. ANECDOTAL. EXAMPLE. SO BRING THESE CONCEPTS TOGETHER THE FUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE GROWTH MINDSET IN HANDS ON LEARNING. TO PROVIDE CONTENT FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL GIRLS OF COLOR. A LAST SUMMER. I HAD A GREAT SUCCESS I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU. THEIR ELEVEN YEAR OLD GIRLS AND EACH SUMMER WE WORK ON A NATIONAL ACADEMY OF ENGINEERING GRAND CHALLENGE. SO LAST YEAR'S CHALLENGE WAS IMPROVE URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE WHETHER ELEVEN SO YOU HAVE TO SAY IT LIKE THEY CAN UNDERSTAND IT SO. WE SAY IMPROVE YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. SO FIRST STEP WAS PLACING THEM. IN THE ROLE OF EXPERTS BUILDING ON THE FUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE ASKING THOSE GIRLS WHAT IS IN YOUR COMMUNITY YOU WANT TO SEE DIFFERENT WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE. SECONDLY GIVING THEM THE HANDS ON TOOLS SO IN THIS CASE IT WAS OUT DEVELOPMENT. AND THEN GIVING THEM GROWTH MINDSET TRAINING SO THEY CONCEDE THAT THROUGH EFFORT AND YOUR MISTAKE YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET BETTER. WELL THE WINNING TEAM THE OUTCOME THERE ELEVEN YEARS OLD. AND THESE GIRLS MADE AN ANTI HUMAN TRAFFICKING UP. THAT WORKED AT A GEO LOCATION IT'S READY TO GO ON THE APP STORE. IT'S READY FOR COMMERCIALIZATION. AND THAT'S THE PRODUCT OF PLACING GIRLS AND THE ROLE OF EXPERTS. IN THEIR WORLDS. AND THEN THE TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY ARE NO LONGER A HINDRANCE THERE ARE TWO THEY'RE JUST THAT WHAT THEY SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO TOOL. TO HELP IMPROVE THEIR LIVES. THEY'RE YOUNG GIRLS BUT THEY HAVE LOTS TO SAY AND SO. THIS IS ONE WAY I BELIEVE TO REALLY. HELP UNDERSERVED GIRLS AND UNDERREPRESENTED POPULATIONS. FIND THEIR WAY IN TECHNOLOGY AND ENGAGE THEM. SO. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO SAY THERE'S ROOM TO SCARE ALL. THERE'S ROOM TO COLLABORATE. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO SO VERY CRITICAL THAT WE'RE ALL HERE TALKING. NOT JUST ACADEMICS BUT. POLICY LEADERS. LEADERS IN THE K. TWELVE SPACE. AS WELL AS TECH LEADERS WHO ARE GOING TO SPEAK. BECAUSE BY WORKING TOGETHER. AND BUILDING ON THE FUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE OF OUR POPULATIONS. AN INCREASING A AND OUT TIGHT FOR GROWTH MIND SADDENED WITH TRIAL YOU CAN ACTUALLY BE A PART OF THIS GAME AND STAY IN IT. AND THEN GIVING PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TOUCH THINGS AND EXPLORE I THINK WE REALLY ARE ON THE RIGHT PATH TO MAKING SOME CRITICAL CHANGES THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR FLOWERS TAYLOR VERY MUCH OUT OF THEM TEND TO THE MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE IT'S IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS. SOME OF COLOR BUT JUST I WANT THANK BOTH YOU A DOCTOR FLOWERS TAYLOR. AND IN REGARDS TO. AND THE FOR THE I. E. C. THREE MODEL. AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT. THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED. IN NOTHING STIR IT YOU HIT ON A LOT OF THEM NOTHING WE'VE HEARD. THINK THE ON STEREOTYPES FOR CERTAIN THAT IT DOESN'T LOT OF SOCIETAL ISSUES STARTS EVEN IN THE FAMILY OFTENTIMES. RIGHT WITH THE BOYS AND GIRLS ARE TREATED DIFFERENTLY IN TERMS OF WHAT THEIR FUTURE PATH ISN'T SO I APPRECIATE YOU. BRINGING THAT UP AND AND TRIMS LOAD LIMIT ACCESS TO HANDS ON STEM LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES I SEE IT YOU KNOW YOU GO TO MIDDLE SCHOOLS. AND AND YOU LOOK AT EITHER OF THE EXTRA CURRICULAR ARE VOLUNTARY ACTIVITIES. YOU'LL SEE IF IT'S A SUCH A SCIENCE FAIR OR A ROBOTICS COMPETITION IS PRETTY MUCH EVEN SPLIT IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THEN HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR SENIOR YEAR THE SAME. ACTIVITIES AS ALMOST ALL BOYS RIGHT AND SO I I I HAVE SEEN AND ADORED ME I'D AND I'M SOME OVER MANY YEARS YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING TIME AND AGAIN. MY QUESTION IS ON. THERE'S A LOT A TECH CAMPS LARA SCIENCE COUNTS NOW THAT A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE BEING ABOUT THE PARENTS GOVERNMENT AND THE REALLY EXPENSIVE. AND SO. ALL AND SOME OF THEM ARE FOCUSING ON WHAT NOT ON GIRLS. AND YOUNG GIRLS AND AND AND YOUNG LADIES AND WOMEN. AT THEM BUT STILL ON THE ACCESS IS IN THERE I LOVE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HOW DO WE SKILLED THAT IN PARTNERING WITH OUR TECH COMMUNITY SO THAT EVERY. YOUNG GIRL HAS AN OPPORTUNITY YES THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION AND. I REALLY APPRECIATE. THE FACT THAT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT THE. MONETARY CONCERNS I MEAN THAT'S A REAL HUGE ISSUE. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST. AREAS AND. FOR COLLABORATION. I'M HONESTLY I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TECH LEADERS WE TALK ABOUT ACADEMIA IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THOSE KIDS. AND SO WITH THAT RESPONSIBILITY THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR. PROVIDING SOME SUPPORT. RIGHT ARM WEEKEND GREATLY BY PROVIDING THOSE KIDS WITH THIS TRAINING. SO WHY NOT INVEST IN THAT IT'S A WORK FORCE IN DEVELOPMENT. THIS IS NOT AND IT'S NOT IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT IT IN THAT CONTEXT IS NOT A SHORT TERM GAIN. IT'S A LONG TERM GAIN SO WE HAVE TO INVEST IN THE LONG TERM AND I THINK I SPEAKING AS A UNIVERSITY. YOU KNOW REPRESENTATIVE I THINK THAT'S UNIVERSITY WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO CONTRIBUTE ABOUT AND THAT COULD MEAN SCHOLARSHIPS THAT COULD MEAN. PROVIDING FOR CERTAIN FAMILIES THAT COULD MEAN PROVIDING LOW IN FREE RESOURCE OPPORTUNITIES AND COLLABORATING WITH SCHOOLS AND TECH LEADERS TO ACTUALLY. PROVIDE AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO FAMILIES THAT ORDINARILY WOULD HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I LIKE THREE FOUR FRAMED AS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR BOTH. OF THE STATE AND GOVERNMENT AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND UNIVERSITIES AS WELL AS FOR THE TECH SECTOR AS OPPOSED TO CHARITY. YOUNG THIS OF NOT SO THAT AS AN INVESTMENT. I WILL MEET WHEN WE TALK ON THE TERMS IN WHICH YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AS A THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND AND DOCTOR WIENER. IN IN TERMS OF THE WORK FORCE BOTH HIRING AND RETENTION. THERE WAS A BILL LAST YEAR BUT IT WAS VETOED BY MISS A VICE A MEMBER EXHAUST FLETCHER. THAT WOULD REQUIRE LARGE EMPLOYERS. NEED TO DISCLOSE SPECIFIED INFO ON GENDER WAGE DIFFERENTIALS TO THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR WOULD BE HELPFUL. I'M WE DEFINITELY THINK THAT. KNOWING NUMBERS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THE MORE TRANSPARENCY THERE IS THAT THESE COMPANIES THE BETTER BECAUSE I OFTENTIMES IT JUST BECOMES A. ISSUE OF WELL WE'RE WORKING ON THE PROBLEM. WHERE WE'RE DOING ALL THESE EFFORTS BUT? NO ONE KNOWS WHAT. ANYTHING IS ACTUALLY PRODUCING CHANGE WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WORKING ARTS NOT WORKING OR IS JUST WINDOW DRESSING FOR OR NOT ACTUALLY PRODUCING ANY CHANGE SO WE'RE DEFINITELY. PROPONENTS OF MORE TRANSPARENCY IN DIVERSITY NUMBERS AND WHAT ACTUALLY. IS HAPPENING WITHIN TECH COMPANIES. I THANK YOU. FOR. LEAD IN THAT CONVERSATION AROUND THAT DRESSING BIAS IN THE WORKPLACE AND CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN AND YOUNG WOMEN. IN PERHAPS WHEN TECHNICOLOR'S UP THAT IN THEIR PART OF THE PRESENTATION THEY CAN TALK ABOUT. HOW TO EXPAND THOSE HANDS ON OPPORTUNITIES YOU KNOW A LOT OF? SCHOOLS HAVE MAKERS SPACES. BUT MANY DON'T AND I KNOW THAT MY DAUGHTER WHO IS ELEVEN YEARS OLD LOVES TO MAKERS SPACE HOW DO WE MAKE IT SO THAT EVERY STUDENT. GETS ACCESS TO THAT PERHAPS TECHNIQUE CAN SPEAK TO THROUGH THEIR MEMBERSHIP OF THEIR WAYS TO PARTNER. WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS AROUND THE IDEA OF CREATING THE SAME TYPES OF HANDS ON OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU THAT YOU'VE ADDRESSED. WE LIKE TO ASK IF YOU HAVE THE TIME TO STAY THERE MAY BE OTHER QUESTIONS THROUGHOUT THE HEARING WE APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SHARED YOUR AND YOUR RESEARCH. AND YOUR PILOT AND WOULD LOVE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ITWITH OUR WORKING GROUP TO SEE IF WE CAN CONTINUE. TO WORK WITH YOU AS YOU AT THE MET YOUR FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I NEXT WEEK WILL CALL. OUT TO DISCUSS SOME MEDICINE PROGRAMS IN CHALLENGES. A DAVID KING. WHO IS DIRECTOR DIVERSITY IN BELONGING AT AIRBNB? AB NEETA SIVA MONEY WHO IS THE CO FOUNDER AND C. E. O.. AT DAM BETA. AND ALICIA PREGGO WAS VICE PRESIDENT STRATEGIES BE SIXTY AND IS HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF VERIZON WIRELESS. WE WELCOME YOU TO COME TO. THE PANEL STABLE. READY FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS WHEN YOU ARE. I THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. MY NAME IS DAVID KING. THE DIRECTOR FOR DIVERSITY AT AIRBNB. A PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS I CAME ONE TWO YEARS AGO. AND ALSO IT OFF BY TALKING ABOUT. DIVERSITY ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE ORGANIZATION AND THEN THE INSIDE OF THE ORGANIZATION. A BIG PART OF THE REASON IS. ABOUT YEARS AGO WE FACED SOME ISSUES OF RACISM HOMOPHOBIA ON A PLATFORM. I REALLY HAD TO LOOK AT DIVERSITY FROM A VERY DIFFERENT. RESPECTIVE IN SOME ORGANIZATIONS WHERE WE HAD A PROBLEM. THAT WAS AFFECTING THE USERS OF OUR PRODUCT. BUT IMAGINE BEING BLACK AND NOT BEING SELECTED FOR AIRBNB BASED NICOLE OF YOUR SKIN. OR BEING GAY AND SHOWING UP TO AN AIR BEING BEING BEING TOLD I'M SORRY YOU CANNOT STAY IN MY HOME. RIGHT SO WE BUILT A PLATFORM WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT. POTENTIAL BUYERS ON THAT PLATFORM. SO CONCURRENT LEADS TO THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING INTERNALLY WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT AS RELEASED TO RECRUITMENT RETENTION WE HAD TO REALLY TELL THE WORLD WHO WE ARE AS A COMPANY. BUT OUR MISSION IS ABOUT BELONG THEY WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU WANT TO BE A MEMBER OF OUR COMMUNITY. THAT YOU BUY INTO. OUR CONSTRUCT OF BELONG AND THAT MEANS IF YOU ARE BIASES RELEASE RACISM HOMOPHOBIA TRANSPHOBIA WE DON'T WANT YOU IN A PLATFORM. WE MADE A BOLD STATEMENT IN LATE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY BASICALLY STATING THAT IF YOU DO NOT. WE'LL LEAVE AND THE UNDERPINNINGS OF WHY WE EXIST WE DON'T WANT ONE A PLATFORM AND SOME PEOPLE DID LEAVE. SOME PEOPLE FRANKLY LEFT THE PLATFORM SAYING I WANT TO LET ANYONE IN MY HOME BUT I CHOOSE TO BE MY HOME VERSES WHO USE AN ORGANIZATION SAY CAN BE A MILE. BUT THAT WAS TOUGH BUT WE REALLY DID HAVE A PLAYBOOK. THERE WAS NOT A COMPANY OUT THERE IT REALLY ADDRESS THIS THIS ISSUE HEAD ON. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF CHATTER OF IT YOU TOLD THE WORLD WE YOUR IS A COMPANY THAT WAS A SUPERBOWL COMMERCIAL ETCETERA BUT WOULD YOU DOING INSIDE. THE ORGANIZATION TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ADVANCE DIVERSITY CONSTRUCTS THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION THE COMMUNITY. A THE FIRST THING WE DID FRANKLY WAS BUILT AN ANTI DISCRIMINATION AND DIVERSITY TEAM. SO THE EFFORTS THAT WE ARE GOING BACK TWO YEARS THERE IS NOW AN EVERGREEN TEAM IN PLACE WHOSE JOB IT IS TO LOOK AT OUR PLATFORM DALY. TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE EXTRACTED BY SUMMER PLATFORM. BUT INCLUDES ENGINEERS DATA SCIENTISTS PEOPLE GLOBALLY MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHO'S BEING ACCEPTED. WHO'S NOT WHY IN IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS MAKING SURE WE ADDRESS THEM IN A RADICALLY BIAS IN THE PLATFORM WE FIND OUT THAT EXISTS. INTERNALLY THERE IS A A GROUP OF ABOUT FIVE PEOPLE WHO ARE DIRECTLY ON THE DIVERSITY AND BELONGING TEAM BUT FOR ME IT'S REALLY. S. GALVANIZING THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE ALL THINKING ABOUT DIVERSITY AS AN ORG. AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE IS TO ATTRACT BY SOME INTERVIEWS PERFORMANCE REVIEWS AND OTHER PEOPLE PRACTICES THAT YOU HEARD FROM MY CLAIMING COLLEAGUE EARLIER. WE HAVE A DIVERSE CANDIDATES SLATE SIN IN PLACE WHICH IS BASICALLY. THE ROONEY RULE THAT THE NFL ADOPTED ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO STATING THAT WE MUST HAVE DIVERSE SLATES OF CANDIDATES OR INSIGHTS ONE SITE FOR INTERVIEWS AND IF NOT. YOU NEED TO GO BACK AND FIND THAT DIVERSITY AND IS AN ALGORITHM USED TO DEFINE WOULD ADVERSELY IT LOOKS LIKE. I WE HAVE TRAINING THAT ARE IN PLACE WHICH LIKELY MADONNA. COLLEAGUE ALSO SPOKE ABOUT UNCONSCIOUS BIAS WHICH A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE DOING. ROSSO DOING ALLY SKILLS TRAININGS INTERNALLY BUT WE'RE ALSO DOING WHICH I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS MAKING SURE THAT WE INTEGRATE DIVERSE CONSTRUCTS AND TO ALL TRAININGS. SO DIVERSITY TRAININGS ARE NOT SEEN AS THIS ONE OFF THING OVER HERE WERE YOU TAKEN UNCONSCIOUS BY TRAINING AND SUDDENLY YOU'RE OKAY. YOU'RE FREE OF BIAS AND YOU'RE GOOD TO GO MAKING SURE THAT ALL OF OUR TRAININGS WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OVER TRAINS TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE DIVERSE CONSTRUCTS EMBEDDED. IN THAT BUYS IS EXTRACTED. EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT SURVEYS WE ARE WE DO PULL SURVEYS AN ANNUAL SURVEYS OF OUR EMPLOYEES. I WITH ABOUT FIFTEEN QUESTIONS GEARED DIRECTLY TOWARDS DIVERSITY IN BELONGING. AND FOR YEARS FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS AGO IN THAT SURVEY THE DIVERSITY RESPONSES WERE VERY HIGH. BUT THESE WERE NOTS OF THE MOST DIVERSE POPULATIONS RESPONDING TO THE SURVEY SO THIS PAST YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME. WE TOOK THAT SURVEY DATA AND BROKEN DOWN BY RACE GENDER AND ETHNICITY AND WE SOLVE CHALLENGES. WE SAW THAT BLACK EMPLOYEES DID NOT FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG TO ANY ORGANIZATION TO THE SAME LEVEL THAT WHITE EMPLOYEES DID. THAT WOMEN DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG TO THE SAME LEVEL THAT MEN DO. SO MAKING SURE THAT WE TAKE ALL OF OUR PEOPLE PRACTICES AND BREAK IT DOWN BY ALL THE CONFLICTS WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS TO ALSO INCLUDE EQUAL PAY. EQUIPED HOUSES WE DO ANNUALLY AND WE'VE TOLD OUR EMPLOYEES IF WE SEE ANY GAPS WE WILL ADDRESS THOSE ACCORDINGLY. BUT ONE THING WE STARTED ON THIS PAST YEAR IS MAKING SURE. THAT WE LOOK AT ETHNICITY AND RACE AS WELL AS GENDER I THINK WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE SEVENTY NINE CENTS TO THE DOLLAR. THAT WOMEN VERSUS MEN ABA WE DON'T TALK QUITE A BIT ABOUT ABOUT HOW WREATH RACE AND ETHNICITY PLAY IN PEOPLE PLAY ALSO. AND. PART OF OUR OUR OUR DUTY INTERNALLY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO ADDRESS GAPS IN THE EXIST. WE'RE ALSO EXPANDING WHAT WE MEASURE BEYOND THE EOC REQUIREMENTS. THE EEO ONE REPORT WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED A FEW TIMES ALREADY THIS MORNING. DOES LOOK AT RACE SUCH RACE GENDER AND ETHNICITY WERE ALSO LOOKING INTERNALLY AT SEXUAL ORIENTATION IDENTITY PARENTAL STATUS DISABILITY AND VETERAN STATUS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT DATA. AND WE CAN MEASURE OF BELONGING ONCE AGAIN INTERNALLY BASED ON CONSTRUCTS ABOVE AND BEYOND THE SEA MANDATE. WORKING WITH OUTSIDE ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP US DO THIS WORK WE CAN DO THIS ALL BY OURSELVES SO WORKING WITH THE CLAIMANT INSTITUTE. ARE WORKING WITH LEAN AND SLASH MCKENZIE WITH THE WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE SURVEY WHICH WE'VE DONE TWO YEARS IN A ROW NOW AIRBNB. AND WORKING WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN CORPORATE EQUALITY INDEX LOOKING AT LGBTQ BELONGING IN THE ORGANIZATION. AIRBNB CONNECTS WE CREATED OUR OWN INTERNAL APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM WHICH EUROPE STARTING V. TO THIS YEAR VERSION TO THIS YEAR. DEFINING. A POPULATION BRINGING THEM IN TRAINING THEM UP. AS PART OF OUR OWN COTERIE AND THEN IDEALLY RETAINING THAT POPULATION BUT IF NOT AT THE END OF THE DAY MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE GROWING THE COMMUNITY OUTSIDE OF OUR WALLS. AND PUTTING PEOPLE IN A POSITION TO SUCCEED AT AIRBNB OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. EXPANDING EFFORTS GLOBALLY QUITE OFTEN WHEN I GO TO OFFICES OUTSIDE OF SAN FRANCISCO. THE CONVERSATION IS DIVERSITY IS NOT OUR THING. SO IMAGINE DUBLIN OR SINGAPORE. AND QUITE OFTEN WHEN THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND THEY REALIZE DIVERSITY IS A THING IN THOSE LOCALES WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN IT IS IN SAN FRANCISCO. SO WE BOTH THE GLOBAL DIVERSITY AMBASSADOR PROGRAM WE HAVE AMBASSADORS WHO WORK FOR US AROUND THE WORLD TWELVE. IN A TWENTY SEVEN OFFICES AROUND THE WORLD AND THEY ARE HELPING US DEFINE DIVERSITY. AND ARE INTEGRATING DIVERSITY PROGRAMMING IN THOSE OFFICES SPECIFICALLY. UP PARTNERSHIPS ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE TO WE CAN'T DO THIS WORK BY OURSELVES WE WORK WITH ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS DEATH COLOR. BUT SHIP WHICH SOCIETY FOR HISPANIC PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS. WELL ASUS THE AMERICAN ENDING INDIAN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING SOCIETY. THE CLAIMANT INSTITUTE OF THE ARTS WHICH IS AN ORGANIZATION FOR YOUNG ADULTS WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND SCRIPTED WHICH IS. PIPELINE PROGRAM PROVIDING CODING OPPORTUNITIES TO MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. WE'VE CREATED IN THE PAST NINE MONTHS SUPPLIER DIVERSITY PROGRAM WHERE WE ARE. ACTIVELY BRINGING DIVERSE SUPPLIERS INTO THE ORGANIZATION AS CONTRACTORS AND VENDORS. AND WE ALSO CREATED A MENTORSHIP PROGRAM FROM SCRATCH INTERNALLY. THAT MENTORSHIP PROGRAM WAS PILOTED WITH OUR EMPLOYEE RESOURCE GROUPS OF WHICH IT'S A VERY DIVERSE GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS. AND THAT WILL GROWTH THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION AS WE MOVE THROUGHOUT BEYOND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. AND THAT EMPLOYER RE SCORE SOURCE GROUP SPACE WE HAVE SIXTEEN GROUPS TOTALING FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEMBERS. AND THOSE MEMBERS ARE TIED TO A SENIOR SPONSORED TYPICALLY SITS ON THE C. SUITE. AS GUIDANCE AND MENTORSHIP WITH ORGANIZATION MOVING FORWARD. BUT SOME OF THINGS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP EARLIER THAN I'D LIKE TO JUST TOUCH UPON BEFORE WE HAVE A FEW NAY LATER. IS ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IN SPACE. AND SOMETHING THAT I'VE SEEN THAT QUITE OFTEN HAPPENS WITH ORGANIZATIONS IS PLAYING WHAT I CALL THE DIVERSITY OLYMPICS. QUITE OFTEN ORGANIZATIONS LOOK AT WOMEN WOMEN IN TECH FIRST. AND THEN SECONDARILY BLACK LET NEXT BOB RELATIONS AND THEN MAYBE LGBTQ MAYBE PEOPLE DISABILITIES AND I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS CONCURRENTLY. AND THERE WERE NOT PITTING GROUPS AGAINST EACH OTHER THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE INTERSECTION AUDI WITH THOSE GROUPS BRING TO THE TABLE. AS BEING THE LEADING VOICE SO TO SPEAK AS OPPOSED TO THE DIFFERENCES THOSE GROUPS BRING TO THE TABLE. DIVERSITY IN MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS ARE QUITE OFTEN IF WE ARE LOOKING. AT OTHER COMPANIES TO ACQUIRE THOSE COMPANIES ARE TYPICALLY SMALLER THAN OUR EXISTING COMPANY AIRBNB. AND TYPICALLY LESS DIVERSE SO HOW DO WE HAVE. OF THOUGHTFUL MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS WHILE TAKING DIVERSITY IN CONSIDERATION IS UNDOUBTEDLY A CHALLENGE. AND SOMETHING I TOUCHED UPON EARLIER WAS EXPANDING OUR EFFORTS GLOBALLY. BUT GLOBALLY FOR ME FRIENDLY MEANS OUTSIDE OF THE BAY. OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE WITH EMPLOYEES AND IN NEW YORK LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT THEN THE EMPLOYEES IN SEATTLE WHICH LOOKS DIFFERENT THAN LONDON LOOKS DIFFERENT IN SOUTH AFRICA. SO HOW DO WE HAVE GLOBAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE CONSTRUCT DIVERSITY THAT VARY BY REGION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THAT OUT MISS CEREMONY WE LOOK YOUR PRESENTATION PERFECT THANK YOU. I WILL THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS MEETING TODAY THINK IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT STEP TO TAKE THAT. A PERSONAGE OF TO HAVE THESE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS AND I CAN BRING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM WHICH IS AN EARLY STATE START UPS ARE REDUCED TO AND A HALF. YEARS IN WE HAVE LESS THAN TWENTY EMPLOYEES BUT I'VE KIND OF BEEN ON BOTH ENDS SO I WENT TO UC DAVIS FOR UNDERGRAD. SO I'VE BEEN A RECIPIENT OF RESOURCES IN EXPANDING MY MIND SET TO NOW BE WHERE I AM TODAY AND SO NOW A LOT OF MY FOCUS IS ON. ENCOURAGING IN ADVANCING OPPORTUNITIES FOR MINORITIES AND STEM. SO I AM ALSO THE FOR A CAN OF ONE OF THE FOUNDING CO CHAIRS OF MILLION WOMEN MENTORS CALIFORNIA WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER ON TODAY. BUT MY START UP IS DURING THE THAT AND WE'RE HEALTH TECH COMPANY ADDRESSING THE EDUCATION GAP BETWEEN AND PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS. INTERMETALLIC G.. AND SO WHEN I FIRST STARTED ARE THE COMPANY I REALLY HONESTLY THOUGHT THAT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT JUST CAME REALLY NATURALLY HOME I WAS NAIVE. IT ACTUALLY TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT AND FOCUS ON BUT IT'S REALLY JUST BUILT INTO MY DNA SO I THINK FROM THE GET GO WITHOUT A CULTURE AND CONVERSATIONS THAT. YOU KNOW MAKE IT AN AND WELCOMING ENVIRONMENT AND TO ME THAT MEANS AND THE ABILITY FOR IT NO MATTER WHO'S WHAT SOMEBODY'S BACKGROUND IS TO BE ABLE TO COME IN. HAVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES ON GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AND ENGAGEMENT WE DO THINGS LIKE INSTEAD OF GOING TO SPORTS ACTIVITIES MAY BE REVIEW SUCCULENTS AND WINE TASTING NIGHT FOR OUR TEAM BUILDERS SO WE JUST DO THINGS THAT OPEN IT UP SO THAT EVERYBODY FEELS WELCOME AND I I HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND. WE LITERALLY CALL IT OUT AND I SAY YOU KNOW ARE YOU AS A MANAGER OF X. Y. Z. TEAM ARE YOU CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE EVERYBODY HAS A VOICE EVERYBODY FEELS COMFORTABLE. AND SO WE DO CHECK INS TO KIND OF ADDRESS UNCUT ON UNCONSCIOUS BIAS OR JUST HOW THAT AWARENESS. I'M SO THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN REALLY HELPFUL FOR US. I THINK ALSO TO FOR OUT WE DO PARTNERSHIP SO WELL AS I MENTIONED WHEN I FIRST STARTED I REALLY THOUGHT OH EVERYBODY'S GONNA WANNA COME WORK FOR US. BUT IT TURNS OUT WE HAVE TO BE REALLY PROACTIVE SO WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE A SINGLE WOMAN A WOMAN APPLY FOR ANY OF OUR ENGINEERING POSITIONS I WENT OUT TO THE DEANS OF UC DAVIS AND SEXY AND I ASK THEM TO CENTER JOB DESCRIPTION NOW. I'M I WORK WITH MATT START TO DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS FOR INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS WITH ALL THE LOCAL AND UNIVERSITIES YOU SEE SEX STATE. OF YOUR P. LUSTROUS COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. I CONTACTED THE STUDENT CLUBS SO THAT I KNEW THAT THESE. GROUPS WERE KNOWING ABOUT WHO WE WERE AND THAT WE WERE AT A LOCAL OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO EITHER INTERN FOR WORK WITH US. NOW THAT WERE FEW YEARS AND WE'RE GOING FURTHER UPSTREAM AS I RECENTLY SPOKE AT THE AG INNOVATION SYMPOSIUM IN FAT NOW WE'RE HOSTING A GROUP OF YOU CITY STUDENTS TO COME TO OUR OFFICE. AND TO REALLY SEE AND EXTEND THEIR LEARNING. WILL SEVER REALLY EXTENSIVE. INTERNSHIP PROGRAM SO WE HAVE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE STUDENTS RIGHT NOW FROM HIGH SCHOOL ALL THE WAY TO MEDICAL SCHOOL DEPENDING ON THEIR INTEREST AREA THEY GET PAID WITH A MENTOR. OUR MOST POPULAR ONE IS IN DERMATOLOGY HOW THREE OF OUR INTERNS JUST GOT PLACED INTO DURING RESIDENCY WHICH WAS A HUNDRED PERCENTUP PLACEMENT SUCCESS RATES ARE VERY PROUD OF THAT. AND WE THEY WORK ON A SPECIFIC PROJECT SO THEY BUILD THEIR EXPERTISE IN THIS CASE AUTHORSHIP AUTUMN. ADD TO REALLY GET THEMSELVES OUT THERE AND BUILD THEIR OWN BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THAT. I'M AND NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING MORE AND MORE OF. THAT'S GREAT AT THE COMPANY LEVEL BUT NOW I'M LOOKING MORE AT YOU KNOW HOW DO WE BUILD THIS INNOVATION ECONOMY IN OUR COMMUNITY. I THINK THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN BE DONE AT THE MACRO LEVEL ON BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG TIP TIP OF THE ICEBERG. I THINK IT'S WORKING MORE WITH LOOKING AT THE SUCCESS OF INSTITUTIONS LIKE YOU CITY SO THEY WERE JUST RECENTLY VOTED AT THE TOP COLLEGE FOR WOMEN IN STAND BY FORBES. AND THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT SO I ACTUALLY SERVED ON THE CHANCELLOR'S GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL AND STUDENT VICE RE COMMITTEE AS A AS A GRAD STUDENT IN BUSINESS SCHOOL. I WAS CHAIR OF THE DIVERSITY IN RETENTION OF UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS SO I REALLY GOT TO SEE SOME OF THE FACTORS FIRST HAND. THAT LED TO THIS GROWTH OMINOUS OUTCOME AND IT REALLY CAME WITH ALL OF THE THINGS ALREADY MENTIONED WHICH IS DELIBERATELY AT ADDRESSING UNCONSCIOUS BIAS LIKE I WROTE THEY HAD WORKSHOPS. AND THAT THEY'RE OPEN CONVERSATIONS THEIR TOWN HALLS THE RIP FORUMS WE WORK TO PREPARE FACULTY TVA'S HIRING COMMITTEES SO I THINK NOW WE SEE THE CULMINATION OF ALL THAT. VERY PROACTIVE AND TANGIBLE EFFORT. SO I THINK WE CAN CONTINUE TO SCALE THAT OTHER OTHER AT OTHER SCHOOLS AND ALSO OTHER COMPANIES IN THE REGION. I ALSO THINK JUST ON THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SIDE THERE'S MORE WE CAN DO TO INVEST IN PROGRAMS LIKE RAILS WITCHES RAPID ACCELERATION INNOVATION LEADERSHIP. AND THEY SUPPORT THE LOCAL ENTREPRENEURIAL ECOSYSTEM SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO FUND PROGRAMS LIKE THAT THAT'S GREAT NOT ONLY FOR THE PIPELINE AND SO BUT ALSO JUST TO HELP COMPANIES LIKE INE SCALE. AND SO WITH THAT I WOULD LOVE TO ALSO ALSO PERFECT HUMAN NAY BUT I'M EXCITED THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION I THINK WE'VE MADE PROGRESS AND THERE'S A LOT MORE WE CAN DO TOGETHER. THANK YOU SO MUCH DO ONE ANNOUNCES THAT. MOST MEMBERS WILL HAVE TO LEAVE IN THE NEXT TWENTY OR SO MINUTES BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME STANDING MEETINGS AT ALL MEMBERS GO TO SO I'M JUST BRIEF. PRESENTATION SO THAT WE CAN HEAR FROM THE THIRD PANEL WE DO WHEN HEAR FROM THEM I'LL HAVE TO LEAVE THE NEXT TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES. THANK YOU FOR THAT MS PREGGO WE WELCOME YOUR. PRESENTATION ON BEHALF OF RICIN. GREAT THANKS FOR HAVING ME AND I'LL I'LL KEEP MY AND COMIC SHORT THAT KNOWING THAT THERE'S PLACES TO BE. SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY AND BE PART OF THIS AND MEETING PAN ALL MY NAME ALICIA PRIEGO AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF ALL RIGHT THEN. BRYSON IS COMMITTED TO FOSTERING AN INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT AND WE CARE ABOUT DIVERSITY IN BOTH OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR SUPPLIERS. AND DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IT'S CRITICAL TO HOW WE ACHIEVE SUCCESS AND WE'RE ALWAYS STRIVING FOR IMPROVEMENT. I'M CURRENTLY THERE'S FIFTY NINE PERCENT DIVERSITY IN VERIZON'S WORKFORCE AND SIX OF OUR TWELVE BOARD. SIX OF OUR TWELVE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ARE WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN FRIDAY HAS SPENT APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WITH DIVERSE SUPPLIERS WERE CONTINUOUSLY SEEKING OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK A MINORITY WOMEN DISABILITY OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES VETERANS SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OR LGBT ON BUSINESSES. AND WE EXPECT ARE PRIMED TO DO THE SAME. AS PART OF OUR EFFORT TO INCREASE DIVERSITY WE ALSO WORK TO IDENTIFY INCLUSIVE PARTNERS THAT I HAD THE OTHER PANELISTS AND HAVE NOTED AS AS BEING AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE SOLUTION. ONE EXAMPLE IS ARE PARTNERING WHEN I'M A PROJECT CALLED PROJECT LEAD THE WAY. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE JOIN PROJECT LEAD THE WAY WHICH IS THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT PROVIDE THE TRANSFORMATIVE IN SCHOOL LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS. WE'VE COMMITTED OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDING FREE TECH ACCESS AND INNOVATED LEARNING PROGRAMS. I WOULD JUST THE FIRST TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS I'M FORTY FOUR PERCENT WERE GIRLS AND FIFTY TWO PERCENT WERE FROM UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY GROUPS. AND. RIGHT AND PARTNERED WITH THIS IMPORTANT PROGRAM DECREE OP OPPORTUNITIES NECESSARY TO INCREASE THE NUMBERS OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES PURSUING STEM DEGREES. AND THIS CONTINUES TO BE A FOCUS AND PRIORITY AND. IN WHICH WE PROVIDE INVESTMENT I'M FIVE YEARS AGO OF RIGHTS AND LAUNCH THE INNOVATIVE LEARNING INITIATIVE AGAIN PROVIDING FREE TECHNOLOGY FREE ACCESS AND INNOVATIVE CURRICULA TO BUILD A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR MILLIONS OF KIDS. AND PART OF THE SCHOOL THAT IS RECEIVING AND THAT'S AN ONGOING TEACHER TRAINING CURRICULUM GUIDES TABLETS AND FOUR G. LTE LTE DATA PLAN. PSALM ALSO RECEIVE INNOVATION LADS OUTFITTED WITH THE LATEST EQUIPMENT AND CONNECTIVITY. AND STUDENTS IN THIS PROGRAM HAVE DEMONSTRATED. INCREASE PROFICIENCY IN READING AND MATH WITH THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS MORE ENGAGED IN SCHOOL. AND AFTER TWO YEARS RIGHT THEN THOUGHT THAT STUDENTS IMPROVED ON STANDARDIZED TESTS AT RATES HIGHER THAN THEIR PEERS THREE TIMES FOR MATH AND TWO TIMES FOR READING. IN FACT JUST YESTERDAY WE ANNOUNCE THAT I WILL INVEST MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO GO TOWARDS THESE INNOVATIVE LEARNING PROGRAMS. AND OUR OBJECTIVES AND CHANGED SURE THAT ALL CHILDREN HAD EVERY CONCEIVABLE OPPORTUNITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND MAKE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE WORLD. AND BY TWENTY TWENTY NEARLY EIGHT IN TEN JOBS OR CRIER TECHNOLOGY SKILLS AND WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE EDUCATION RESOURCES STUDENTS NEED. AND TO BE SUCCESSFUL. LAUGHED FREE TO DISRUPT THAT THAT I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF RIGHT IN THE COMP WHICH MEANT AND AWARDS I'M FOR THE FOURTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF RIGHT THAT WAS RECOGNIZED BY THE BLACK ENTERPRISE MAGAZINE FOR SEEING THE VALUE OF THE LINK BETWEEN DIVERSITY ENGAGEMENT AND NAMED ONE OF. THE BEST CUT COMPANIES FOR DIVERSITY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH THE WORKPLACE EXCELLENCE AND DIVERSITY AWARD. AND IN ADDITION FOR SEVEN CONSECUTIVE YEARS THE US HAS MANIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE RECOGNIZE RIGHT IN FOR OVER ONE BILLION. AND AND INVESTMENTS AND HISPANIC BUSINESS ENTERPRISES. AND THOSE ARE JUST TAKE NOTE A COUPLE OF OUR ADD. UP PARTNERSHIPS AND INVESTMENTS IN THE COMMUNITY AND VERY WHO LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THAT COMMITTEE ON THE ON THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THOSE GREAT EXAMPLES. FROM VERIZON AND DON'T. AND AIRBNB ON EFFORTS THAT ARE REALLY ONGOING AND CREATIVE. TO HELP US LAST DAM OUR DIVERSITY GAPS. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS. OUT WE INVITE YOU TO TO STAY WITH US WE HAVE ONE MORE PANEL WE'D LOVE TO HEAR ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WISH TO OFFER BUT THANK YOU FOR THOSE PRESENTATIONS. I WOULD LIKE TO CALL FORWARD FROM. DISCUSS SOME OF OUR FUTURE EFFORTS AND TO BUILD ON WHAT WE JUST HEARD. ANDREA DIVO VICE PRESIDENT A STATE POLICY AND POLITICS AT TECH NET. GINA LU HAN THE FOUNDER AND CEO OF HACKER LAB AND CO FOUNDER AND CEO OF CODE FOR GOOD. AND LUPITA ALCALA THE COMMISSION OF FROM THE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS. WE WELCOME YOU WE ARE READY WHEN YOU ARE. SAID I READ IT ALL AND A SUPER FAST OR JUST CUT TO THE CHASE. ALRIGHT I MY COMMITTEE IS ALWAYS THE CUTS WITH ALL RIGHT THERE YOU GO THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. CHAIRMAN AND MISTER HOLE IN COMMITTEE ANDREA DEVOUT VICE PRESIDENT OF STATE POLICY AND POLITICS FOR TACK MATT. WE'RE PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY I TECH NOT REPRESENTS OVER EIGHTY OF THE NATION'S LEADING TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION COMPANIES. AND WE ARE COMMITTED. AND DEDICATED TO WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR LEADERS THAT ARE BEFORE US TODAY AND THOSE. THAT ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH US ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE SO THANK YOU FOR HOSTING THE HEARING. WE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS I DO WANT TO NOTE CHAIRMAN. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING YOUR DOUBTS THE WORKING GROUP THAT YOU ESTABLISH WE HAD OUR FIRST. MEETING I THINK IT WAS ON THE TWENTY THIRD AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT MEETING ON THE NINETEENTH AND GATHERING THE RIGHT FOLKS TO REALLY START. YOU KNOW CREATING A DIFFERENCE ON BOTH WITHIN THE HALLS OF THE CAPITOL AS WELL. AS WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY SO THANKYOU FOR INITIATING THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING EFFORTS THERE. INTO IT SORT OF IN THAT THE THEME OF CUTTING TO THE CHASE. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT ARE SOME OF OUR MEMBER COMPANIES I'M HAVE DONE AND ARE CONTINUING TO DO. JUST AROUND THEIR COMMITMENT AYE IN DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION SEVERAL OF OUR MEMBER COMPANIES ALL LIST IF YOU CA TECHNOLOGIES CISCO HP PAYPAL. CENTER VISA AND SEAGATE HAVE SIGNED ON TO THE CBO ACTION. FOR DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION PLEDGE SO I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE AWARE THAT SOME OF THE PRICE WATER COOPER INITIATIVE THAT WAS INITIATED BY TEN. CEOS AYE THAT CAME TOGETHER ON AND THERE ARE NOW OVER FOUR HUNDRED CEOS WHO HAVE PLEDGED TO TAKE CONCRETE ACTIONS TO INCREASE DIVERSITY. INTENTIONALLY CULTIVATE WORKPLACES THAT ARE INCLUSIVE AND PUBLICLY REPORT THEIR EFFORTS AND BASS BEST PRACTICES. ALL OF A LARGE TECH COMPANIES WE SURVEYED AND. OVER THE LAST YEAR ACTUALLY TECHNET HAS ENDEAVORED ARE SORT OF A SELF APPOINTED EFFORT. WHERE WERE? WE'VE BEEN TALKING WITH A LOT OF OUR MEMBER COMPANY SOME OF THIS PUBLIC INFORMATION SOME OF AN INTERNAL AND GATHERING THAT INFORMATION SO THAT WE. AS TECHNO CAN BE EDUCATED IN TERMS OF A WHAT PROGRAMS ARE INSTITUTED WITHIN OUR MEMBER COMPANIES ARE WHAT PROGRAMS THEY'RE LOOKING AT. AYE INSTITUTING AYE TO REALLY CREATE A DIFFERENCE AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON THIS ISSUE. SO. AS WE WE DID THE SURVEY. WE WE REALIZED THAT OUR MEMBER COMPANIES HAVE INCREDIBLE PROGRAMS NOT ONLY. THAT HAVE BEEN UNDER WAY FOR WHETHER IT'S BEEN FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT TEN YEARS OR ARE BEING. CONTEMPLATING INSTITUTED BASED OFF OF THE GREAT RESEARCH SOME OF WHAT YOU'VE HEARD HEARD FROM TODAY AS WELL AS BEDS PRACTICES. AS THAT GENTLEMAN FROM AIRBNB DAVID KING TALKED ABOUT. SO SOME COMMON TRAININGS FOR NEW HIRES IN SENIOR LEADERSHIP INCLUDE UNCONSCIOUS BIAS. APPRECIATING DIFFERENCES AND THE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT FOR DIVERSITY. I THINK MISTER KALRA HAD ALLUDED TO THAT. FOR EXAMPLE OVER NINETY PERCENT OF THESE IS LEADERSHIP HAVE COMPLETED THEIR UNCONSCIOUS BIAS TRAINING TODAY. A WHILE EVER HAS FIVE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES COMPLETING THEIR TRAINING. MENTORING PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED TO DEVELOP DIVERSE SENIOR LEADERSHIP FROM WITHIN THE COMPANY. AT HP IS SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE CATALYST AT HP MENTORING PROGRAM ARE WOMEN OR PEOPLE OF COLOR. SINCE FIRST LAUNCHING THE PROGRAM SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE PROTEGES PROTEGES HAVE BEEN PROMOTED ARE MOVED INTO NEW POSITIONS AT HP. VISA HAS ESTABLISHED THE V. SEXY EXECUTIVE EDGE. GLOBAL LEADERSHIP PROGRAM FOR WOMEN DEVELOPED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH UC BERKELEY HAAS SCHOOL OF MINUTE BUSINESS THEY HAVE TRAINED SIXTY PLUS WOMEN TODAY. THESE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF OF TECHNET MEMBER COMPANIES AGAIN SORT OF CUTTING TO THE CHASE. THIS COMMITMENT IS EMBEDDED IN OUR CULTURE. TECH COMPANIES ARE NOT ONLY ESTABLISHING PROGRAMS DEPARTMENTS AND ENTIRE INITIATIVES TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE OF DIVERSITY AND TALK WITH THEIR WORKING TOWARDS IS BEING A PART OF THE DNA. THE FIRST STEP IS KNOWING YOU HAVE A PROBLEM TO SOLVE. WHERE THERE? NOW WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS THE SOLUTION IT WON'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT BUT WITH THE PARTNERSHIPS OF THE INDUSTRY. OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND OUR ELECTED LEADERS WE'RE NOT FAR FROM ACHIEVING OUR COLLECTIVE GOAL OF EXCELLENCE THROUGH EQUALITY IN OUR WORKFORCE. I CHAIRMAN THURMAN YOU SPECIFICALLY I'M HAD PASSED AROUND THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT THAT DOCTOR FLOWERS HAD I HAD ALLUDED TO IN RESPONSE TO MR CALLER'S QUESTION. OF A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES AROUND FINANCIAL SUPPORT I CAN CERTAINLY PROVIDE MORE I THINK THE WORKING GROUP WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE FOR THIS. THAT CA TECHNOLOGIES. THEY HAVE PARTNERED WITH THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB OF AMERICA AND CREATED TECH GIRLS ROCK. WITH TEN MILLION DONATED SINCE I TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE. LIKEWISE THEY HAVE INCREDIBLE PARTNERSHIPS WITH SESAME STREET A ONE MILLION. AS IT'S CALLED ONE MILLION SESAME WORKSHOP AIMED AT AGES THREE THROUGH FIVE SO AGAIN SORT OF GETTING TO ARE WE JUST TARGETING A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF. OF KIDS ON THAT'S ALL AROUND STEM LEARNING. VERIZON TALK TODAY ABOUT THEIR CITY OF SACRAMENTO EARMARKED WITH TWENTY MILLION OR TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR PROGRAMS TO INCREASE DIVERSITY AND TACK. UP PUTS MATES FOR EXAMPLE DONATES TWO DOLLARS RUMOR EVERY ORDER TO THE ACLU JUST A FEW EXAMPLES SORT OF AROUND THAT FINANCIAL PEACE. I AM I WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL OF OUR FELLOW PANELISTS SO I HOPE WILL END THERE I THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN AND LOOK FORWARD TO THIS JUST BEING THE BEGINNING OF THESE CONVERSATIONS AND CONTINUING. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER BILL AND ALSO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK TO HELP US PULL TOGETHER OF THE PARTNERS WHO CAME TO BE A PART OF THE WORKING GROUP AND. THE LIST OF RESOURCES THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED AND PERHAPS YOU CAN HELP US CONNECT SOME. DISTRICTS THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN. CONNECTING WITH THOSE RESOURCES TO HELP THEM EXPAND THEIR PROGRAMS. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. AND I WANNA. KNOWLEDGE ONE OF THE PARTNERS HAS BEEN WORKING WITH OUR GROUP AND WE APPRECIATE HAVING YOU KNOW LOU HAN HERE. AND. AND KEEP THE ALCALA. IN A MOMENT I'M HAVE TO THE THEY APOLOGIZE IF I DON'T GET TO HEAR ALL YOUR PRESENTATION BUT WE WELCOME. YOU TO BE PART OF OUR ONGOING EFFORT TO THE WORKGROUP. OUR VICE CHAIR. SOME OF THEM FLOOR IS GOING TO CUT TAKE THE CONVERSATION FROM HERE AND IF YOU ALL HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS. THEY'LL MAKE SURE THAT WE INCORPORATE THOSE INTO THE WORKING GROUP AND FROM MOVING FORWARD. SO I'M SURE THAT. MISS NOHA READY. HELLO I'M GENERALLY HAUNTED I'M CEO OF HACKER LAB AND CODE FOR HOOD. THIS IS A VERY NEAR AND DEAR TOPIC FOR ME I'M ACTUALLY I'M A TEENAGE A FORMER TEENAGE RUNAWAY I HAD FIVE KIDS BY THE TIME I WAS TWENTY TWO. AND I LEGALLY HAVE A SEVENTH GRADE EDUCATION. THAT'S LAST GREAT I COMPLETED ACTUALLY I WENT TO SCHOOL LATER BUT AS FAR AS BEING AND AT SCHOOL. ARM I WAS ON THE WELFARE TO WORK PROGRAM AND WHAT CHANGE MY LIFE WITH LEARNING HOW TO CODE WHEN I WAS TWENTY SIX YEARS OLD. AND WE RUN A PROGRAM MY CO FOUNDERS OVER THERE ALLEN WHERE. AND THAT ORGANIZATION A NONPROFIT CALLED CODE FOR HOOD ATLANTIS HAD MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND DONE SOME REALLY GREAT THINGS HERE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND STATEWIDE. DOING THINGS ON IN REGARDS TO EDUCATION WE HOLD STE. ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN LOW COST VERY AT ENTRY LEVEL TECHNOLOGY CLASSES A MONTH WE ALSO OFFER LOW COST INCUBATION SPACE AND. BY THEN A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN EQUIPMENT AND WE ALSO PARTNER WITH EDUCATIONAL AND ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS. OUR WORK WITH YOUR COLLEGE LED TO OUR MAKER SPACES GETTING FUNDING FOR THE WHOLE CITY CALIFORNIA IN. IN RESPECT TO SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS SO NOW THERE'S TWENTY SCHOOLS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'M COMMITTEE COLLEGES THAT HAVE MAKERS SPACES DUE TO THE WORK THAT HACKER LAB IS DONE. CODE FOR HOOD I'M GOES INTO. UNDER REPRESENTED NEIGHBORHOODS AND WE DO HACKATHONS WORKSHOPS AND BOOT CAMPS WE OFFER AFTER SCHOOL ON SERVICES AS WELL AND WE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON. ON LOW INCOME AND CHILDREN OF COLOR ITEM AND OFFER THEM A QUALITY AND ACCESS WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR THREE YEARS NOW AND HAVE SERVED OVER TWO THOUSAND CHILDREN. ON AND THIS IS THIS IS WHAT WE DO AND IT IS VERY IT'S A VERY MUCH NEEDED. AYE AND. MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES IN THESE AREAS AND IN REGARDS TO. LACK OF EDUCATION IN STEM LACK OF RESOURCES AND. LACK OF PARENTAL SUPPORT AS FAR AS THEIR EDUCATION AND KNOWLEDGE OF HOW IMPORTANT STEM IS FOR THEIR CHILDREN. ON IT STARTS AT HOME AYE I DO SEE THERE'S A BIG BARRIER. WHEN IT COMES TO PARENTS ACTUALLY THINKING THAT THEIR CHILDREN CAN ACCOMPLISH THE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY DOES STARTED HOME ESPECIALLY THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY COMING FROM A VERY BLUE COLLAR BACKGROUND. ITEMS STATING FACTS LIKE OWE ME HOW YOU'RE SO. A YEAR SO YOU THINK YOU'RE SUCH A BIG CHIN GOING BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BECOME AN ENGINEER AND SO THEY ACTUALLY GET CHASTISED AND MADE FUN OF BECAUSE THEY ONE ACTUALLY GO TO COLLEGE YOU BECOME AN ENGINEER. OR BECOME AND ACTUALLY HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER WHO WENT TO THE MILITARY BECAUSE HE WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE TO BECOME AN AERONAUT ERIC. ARROW NOT ACHE. I ENGINEER AND HIS FATHER TOTALLY LAUGHED AT HIM AND HE ENDED UP BECOMING. BOB MILITARY POLICE AND ARMY THE HIGH PATROLMAN BUT HE WANTED TO BE AN ENGINEER SO ON THESE THINGS ACTUALLY DO STARTED HOME. THERE'S OF HUGE LACK OF RESOURCES WHEN IT COMES TO ON PROVIDING THIS TYPE OF EDUCATION BECAUSE OF THE FUNDS THAT NEEDS. THAT IS NEEDED TO ACTUALLY GOING TO THESE THE SCHOOLS AND PERFORM EDUCATION ON IT. WHICH STEM CURRICULUM. SO. WERE HOPING THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO ADD MORE RESOURCES AS WE GO WHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF WORK TRYING TO GET INTO THE FRIDGE COMMUNITY CENTER SOMEWHERE IN SOUTH SACRAMENTO. SO WE ACTUALLY CAN PROVIDE A MAKERS SPACE FOR THE YOUTH IN THOSE AREAS ON YOU'LL HEAR MORE FROM ALLEN LATER HE ACTUALLY TEACHES ON THE STUDENTS EVERY WEEKEND. ON I JUST I JUST DO THIS THING AND THIS IS THE RIGHT TO SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND I'LL LEAVE IT TO THEM TO BE RESPECT. THANK YOU FOR DOING WHAT YOU DO AND WHAT YOU SHARED ABOUT OVERCOMING AND THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE CAN DO FOR OUR STUDENTS THANK YOU. SADDAM. THE MORNING LOOK AT THAT PROCESS OF COLOR I M. A COMMISSION ON THE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS. AND. MY DAY JOB IS THAT I AM AT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION OF MY INTEREST IN LOVE OF STEM EDUCATION AND PARTICULARLY GIRLS AND UNDERREPRESENTED YOUTH THAT WAS. BORN FROM MY TIME SPENT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS ABOUT TWELVE YEARS THERE LAST SERVING AS THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF INSTRUCTION AND LEARNING. UP I JUST LOOK AT THE NUMBER SO WHAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY'S REALLY QUICK ABOUT GROUND ZERO A WHICH COULD BE IN THE HOME BUT ALSO IN K. TWELVE EDUCATION AND THE DISPARITY. IN EQUITIES START REALLY YOUNG. IN COURSEWORK AND SO I KNOW THAT I PASSED OUT A A LITTLE POWER POINT AND YOU CAN'T SEE AND I APOLOGIZE BUT I'LL READ YOU WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE. WE'VE AYE AT THE AS THE COMMISSION OF THE SETTLEMENT GROWTH WE FOCUS ON STEM EDUCATION NOT. OF JUST BECAUSE OF MY INTEREST BUT THE ENTIRE COMMISSION IS INTERESTED THROUGH OUR CO SPONSORSHIP FOR THE STEAM SYMPOSIUM WITH DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. OF AS WELL TOWN HALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THAT'S IN MY PRESENTATION BUT IF YOU LOOK AT SLIDE THREE. AND YOU LOOK AT THE CALIFORNIA MALE TO FEMALE STUDENT RATIOS WE COULD HAVE THE VERY SAME SORT OF RATIOS BUT WORSE IF YOU COMPARED TO UNDERREPRESENTED YOUTH AND STUDENTS OF COLOR. SO WHAT WE'RE SHOWING HERE IS THAT THERE ARE GENDER STEREOTYPES EVEN AS EARLY AS K. TWELVE EDUCATION NOW THE RATIO OF MALES TO FEMALES TURNS OUT IT'S ONE POINT ZERO FOUR TWO ONE. SO THE SCIENCE IS ABOUT ACCURATE. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT COMPUTER PROGRAMMING I'VE BEEN STUDYING THIS FOR FOUR YEARS. AND THIS IS OUR CURRENT NUMBERS OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. IT'S TWO POINT SIX THREE TWO ONE THOUGHTS ABOUT NUMBER SAYS THERE'S STILL MORE THAN DOUBLE MALE TO FEMALE RATIO IF YOU LOOK AT COMPUTER EDUCATION ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE SEVEN TO ONE. ENGINEERING IS ONE POINT FIVE SEVEN ONE WE HAVE MADE HEADWAY OF WHAT WE'VE. WHAT I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW IS AND COMPUTER EDUCATIONAL LAST FOR YEARS WE'VE BEEN CREWS ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND GIRLS IN COMPUTER EDUCATION? ENGINEERING WE'VE ACTUALLY INCREASED ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND GIRLS. OF SCIENCE IS ABOUT THE SAME WOULD ON AN INCREASE BUT PROPORTIONALLY BECAUSE WE'VE HAD MORE ENROLLMENT AND STUDENT WITH ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND. MORE GIRLS A COMPUTER PROGRAMMING HAS GONE FROM THREE POINT ZERO SEVEN TO ONE THAT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO. TO TWO POINT SIX FIVE TO ONCE A WEEK THERE'S BEEN ONLY A FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY GIRLS INCREASE. NOW THERE HAS ALSO TO DO WITH A SPECIALIZED COURSES HAVE BEEN CREATED LIKE INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES WHICH ARE SKEWED THAT THAT NUMBER SLIGHTLY. BUT WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THAT THOSE BIASES OF YOU KNOW YOU'VE SEEN A LOT OF THE NUMBERS FOR SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS ONCE THOSE NAY IN THOSE NUMBERS COME TO LIFE BY ETHNICITY. IT'S AMAZING HOW PEOPLE TAKE PAY ATTENTION RIGHT AND SO WHILE I HAVE THESE NUMBERS COURSE WORK SO WE CAN GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE IT'S HAPPENING AND HOW EARLY IT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS OF. GIRLS AND UNDERREPRESENTED YOUTH JUST BEING KIND OF TURNED AWAY FROM SOME OF THIS COURSE WORK. SO SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS I HAVE IS I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME. I WANT YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S IN HERE IS THAT WE'VE OF POPULAR HE HOSTED QUITE A FEW CO SPONSORED A LOT OF THE STEAM SYMPOSIUMS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WEAPON AMAZING INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS ON THE MILLION WOMEN MENTORS. UP PROGRAM. AND OF COURSE WE'VE IMPLEMENT COLLUDED IN THE NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS A SUPPORTING EFFORTS IN CORPORATE GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN INTO THE EQUITY IN ACCESS FRAMEWORK. TRAINING MODULE FOR ALL TEACHERS WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT ON A TO ADDRESS GENDER BIAS BUT WHAT I WANTED TO ARE ALSO TURNED LEAVE YOU WITH IS. WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY AND MENTORSHIPS AND INTERNSHIPS? WE ALSO SHOULD BE REQUESTING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ETHNICITY BY THESE COURSE WORK SO THAT WE CAN SORT OF SLICE AND DICE IT. OF FURTHER MAKERS SPACES AS EARLY AS ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOL. ALSO THE WAY WE MARKET. AND. THESE COURSES FOR GIRLS AND UNDERREPRESENTED YOUTH JUST THE COLOR OF THE MARKETING YOU KNOW POSTER OR THE NAME OF THE COURSE ITSELF LIKE ENGINEERING AND DESIGN FOR INSTANCE MAY APPEAL TO WOMEN AND GIRLS. AND OTHER STUDENTS OF COURSE AND OF COURSE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. EVERY INDUSTRY HAS BIAS EVERY SINGLE INDUSTRY NOT IN IN IN TEACHING AND ADMINISTRATORS THERE'S IS NO LESS OF THAT AND SO PROVIDING MORE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OTHER OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THESE MAKERS SPACES. IF THERE COULD BE SOME SORT OF OUTREACH EFFORT LIKE THERE WAS AN HIGHER ADDING COMMITTEE COLLEGE FOR K. TWELVE FOR MAKERS SPACES MANY WANTED THEY JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT AND THAT'S WHY. IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO. CONTINUE AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME AND I APOLOGIZE BUT MORE MY INFORMATION IS IN THE SLIDES AND I'LL HAVE TO JUST SHARE THE FLIGHT DECK SO THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY READ IT. UP BECAUSE IT'S QUITE SMALL OF THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ESTA PRESENT TODAY. I THINK YOU WE WILL BE WORKING TO INCORPORATE MANY THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM ALL THESE PANELS WITH THE WORKING GROUP. THANK YOU FOR THAT. WHAT IT KNOWLEDGE JOHNSON COLLEAGUES WHO'VE JOINED US? SOME WOMEN BLOOM NUMBER BONTA GRAY PARTNERS WHO BEEN VERY COMMITTED TO THE IDEAS OF INCREASING DIVERSITY. IN TECH. LET. THE VICE CHAIR LEAD TO OTHER ANY QUESTIONS AND IF NOT WILL CLOSE OUT AND MAKE SURE THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE DAY. ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE WORKING GROUP'S THINKING. ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. NOW. A QUESTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE ANYTHING CLOSE REMARKS. ONE ANSWER. OKAY. OKAY OUT TRY TO BE RESPECTFUL PEOPLE TOPIC FORGIVE ME UP TO SPEAK. I'M A TALK FAST SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT ON THE FRONT AND MY NAME IS ALAN WHERE. MOM I AM A MECHANICAL ENGINEER HAVING GOT MY BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING FROM BAYLOR UNIVERSITY AND. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN OUR WORK FOR ROCKWELL COLLINS A DEFENSE CONTRACT WORK NOT BUT SIMULATORS FOR B. FIFTY ONE B. FIFTY TWO SEVEN THIRTY SEVENS BLACKHAWK HELICOPTERS AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT. UP AFTER THAT I WENT AND WORKED FOR A COMPANY FIBER SPAIN WHICH THE DISTRIBUTED ANTENNA SYSTEMS ESSENTIALLY HELPING CELLPHONE SIGNALS GETTING TO PLACES. ARE WHERE YOU CAN ONLY GO TO WORK IN A VERY. ON A PILOT PROGRAM FOR THE MTA BUILDING BOXES FOR TELECOM COMPANIES. EIGHTEEN T. T. MOBILE SPRINT ALL OF THOSE TO HELP US CELL PHONE SIGNAL GET TO THE EMPTY EXCEPT SUBWAY LINE. UNTO DEATH ELEVEN I MOVED TO A CALIFORNIA TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON FILM HACKER LAP IN A PRETTY MUCH BEEN THEIR SENSE. OF CURRENTLY A MEMBER OF HACKER LAP FIFTEEN IMAGE AND I AM THE CHIEF TECHNICAL OFFICER OF COBRA HOOD WHERE I TEACH DO A LOT WITH CURRICULUM. I'M ALSO AN ADJUNCT FACULTY AT SIERRA COLLEGE GOING IN MY THIRD SEMESTER TEACHING INTRODUCTION TO THE PRINTING THAT ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING CLASS AND I ALSO DO A FREELANCE DESIGN A MECHANICAL DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING CONSULTING READING THIS FORUM. FOR ALLOWING US TO TALK. AND JUST I WANT TO MAKE SURE BEFORE THE INTO NEXT PART I WAS ALWAYS TAUGHT TO A NOT BITE THE HAND THAT FEEDS YOU. SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M ADEPTLY SAY EVERYTHING THEM BUT TO SAY FROM. FROM A I'M FEELING OF GRATITUDE APPRECIATION ALSO WANNA GIVE ABOUT GLORY REFERENCE TO GOD FOR IT IS THROUGH HIS GRACE AND MERCY YEAH BUT I HAD WHAT KIND OF THE HEAD ON KILL SET NOW MAYBE THIS MAY BE TWO PRIVATE SUMMIT THAT. I WOULD EXPECT I MUST WORK FOR A COMPANY I'D BE PULLING ANYWHERE BETWEEN EIGHTY THOUSAND OR TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR ANNUALLY. BUT I'M NOT DOING THIS BECAUSE I DO THIS BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME. IT'S IMPORTANT ME BECAUSE I GREW UP IN EAST SAINT LOUIS ILLINOIS. CHILD TO A SINGLE MOTHER WHO WAS BIPOLARAND THAT IT WASN'T EASY AMONG STARTED SCHOOL EARLY I GRADUATE SCHOOL AT A SIXTEEN YEARS OLD AND THEN WENT TO BRADLEY UNIVERSITY WHERE I WAS ONE OF ELEVEN BLACKMAIL FRESHMAN. OUT OF A. INCOMING CLASS OF ONE THOUSAND I WAS THE ONLY BLACK MALE ENGINEERING MAJOR IN A BRADLEY WHICH IS PUBLIC IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE PERCENT WHITE SCHOOL TIME THAT I WENT THERE. SO BE AND THEN AFTER THAT ARE GOING TO. GOING TO WORK FOR ROCKWELL COLLINS WHO HAS GIVEN ME A PRETTY UNIQUE EXPERIENCE ON THIS. SO IT IS FROM THAT IS FROM THAT PLACE IN THAT EXPERIENCE WHICH I SPEAK TO YOU ALL THE DAY. COME AND AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING. PRETENTIOUS YOU KNOW I AM WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO CREATE. I AM AN ENGINEER BECAUSE OF PROGRAMS THAT WERE PRE A PRE COLLEGE BECAUSE PROGRAMS I CAN TELL YOU THE MINUTE BUT I DECIDED I WANTED TO BE A MECHANICAL ENGINEER WAS NINTH GRADE. AND I WANTED ENGINEERING OPEN HOUSE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS' AND EXPLAIN ALL OF THE DIFFERENT YOU NEARING CIVIL ELECTRICAL MECHANICAL ASSAULT ROBOTICS OPEN HOUSE LIKE THAT I WANTED TO DO THAT. ON IBM ONCE I WAS IN ONE THOUSAND COLLEGE I GOT WILL ACTUALLY BEFORE I GOT IN THE COLLEGE ALMOST PART OF THE INROADS PROGRAM WHICH. TALKS WHICH TAUGHT HOME. WHICH TAUGHT OF PEOPLE FROM MINORITY BACKGROUNDS BUSINESS SKILLS YOU KNOW HOW TO HOW TO ACT HOW TO BEHAVE YOU KNOW STRATEGIES TO DO IT IS FOR ME COMING FROM EAST SAINT LOUIS. A LOT OF THOSE THINGS WERE. WERE NOT KNOWN TO ME SO TO BE JUST FRANK HERE A WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE WE KNOW WITH ENCOURAGED BY OUR AND WE KNOW WHAT EQUITY. WE EQUITY I DON'T HAVE TO TELL THAT TO YOU ALL BUT MYSELF BEING AN ENGINEER I DON'T DEAL WITH THE WORDS I LIKE IT TO BE I DEAL WITH THE WATER TO THE. EQUITY IS IT HERE AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE HERE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND WE NEED TO ACCEPT THAT. SO IT IS WITH THAT IT IS WITH THAT ATTITUDE. LET US SAY WHAT I SEE FROM MINE IS THAT THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH SUPPORT I'M THANKFUL FOR THIS BUT ARM I CAN'T PAYMENT I STILL HAVE A PAYMENT RIGHT NOW. BOB I'M WAITING ON A PAYMENT FOR CLASS THAT I DID AT THE ECO PARK COMMUNITY CENTER LAST YEAR THAT'S BEEN WAITING SIX MONTHS. I'D BUT ARM IT WILL BE VERY VERY EASY FOR ME JUST TO GO CHECK MY RESUME OUT THERE AND GO BUT I BUT I DO THIS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN IT BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT ME AND ALSO AS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE. I STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF PEOPLE WHO CAME BEFORE ME HAVE SACRIFICED A LOT SO I CAN DO THE OPPORTUNITY OF THINGS THAT THEY HAD NEVER HAD MIND OF NO CONTINUE DOING THAT. UNTIL I AM NO LONGER ABLE TO BUT. WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THE ACTUAL PROGRAMMING AND THE AND LIKE I SAY WHY I WOULD LOVE YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE HEARD SOME OF THE THINGS LIKE OF THE LADY EARLIER WAS TALKING ABOUT. OWNED THE KIDS WHO ARE WHO WHO BUILT OF WHO WHO BUILT ON ACT AND THINGS LIKE THAT THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT OF FLASH AND SIZZLE WHEN IT COMES TO TECH BUT FOR ME I'M IN THE TREE. I AM VERY THANKFUL TO THE TO EFFORTS LIKE THE RAILS PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWED ME TO DO A TWELVE WEEK PROGRAMMING CLASS WITH QUEEN TICKET FOR RISKING THE COLLABORATIVE. ALTHOUGH BECAUSE OF SOME OF THEM. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE WERE UNABLE TO MEET IN TIME I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN THIS YEAR BUT STILL THAT OF THAT GRANT HAS ALLOWED US TO PUT THAT NETWORKING EQUIPMENT WERE ACTUALLY CURRENTLY BUILDING OUT. SOME SOME NETWORKING INFRASTRUCTURE CYBERSECURITY IS ACTUALLY REALLY BIG THING SO I MEAN I MEAN AT THE END THE DAY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE GET THE CASH OR NOT I'M GONNA KEEP DOING THIS FOR AS LONG AS I CAN. BUT THE THING IS IS THAT. REALLY TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS I MEAN YOU CAN LOOK AT JUST THE. IN THIS ROOM I MEAN AND I THINK THERE'S A POINT WHERE THE THING I LIKE ABOUT TEACHING KIDS IS THAT IS THE TYPE OF THING THAT. NOBODY REALLY HE DISAGREES WITH IN THEORY BUT WHEN IT ACTUALLY COMES DOWN TO WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO GETTING TO IT WILL BE HARD TO DO AND AS YOU KNOW I CAN'T PAY MY RENT RIGHT NOW. SO. SO I GUESS THE TAKE AWAY IS IS THAT NOW THAT ONCE WE. ESTABLISH THE FACT THAT EQUITY WHILE THAT IS THE GOLD IS NOT WE'RE GOING TO GET TO. DEALING WITH THE WORLD CITY IS TECH DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE EXPERT. ON THERE ARE A LOT OF OPEN SOURCE TOOLS OUT THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS OUT THERE AND IT IS FROM THAT. IT IS FROM THAT SO THAT BACKYARDS WHICH FROM I TEACH. A LOT OF THE COMPUTERS ARGUES THAT PROBABLY HAVE ABOUT EIGHTY LAPTOPS WHICH WE USED TO GOING INTO FIVE MOST OF THEM ARE SECOND HAND SOME OF THEM UP A LOT OF THEM. ARE PAID OUT OF MY OWN POCKET SOME OF THEM SOME OF OUR EQUIPMENT HAS A CAN MEAN THAT WE HAVE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO WORK TO BUILD THAT THROUGH SOME OF THE OF FUNDING THAT WE'VE GOTTEN. ARM AND SO WE AND SO IT'S ALWAYS JUST AS ALWAYS HAS BEEN MY LIFE WITH THE ATTITUDE THAT GOT ME THROUGH SCHOOL THAT'S GOT ME THROUGH A WORK ENVIRONMENT. THE WORLD WHAT IT IS AND IT'S MY JOB TO DEAL TO TO DEAL WITH WHAT I'VE GOT TO THE BEST THAT I CAN WITH. BUT I'M I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A SHIFT IN HOW WE DEAL WITH THIS STUFF BECAUSE HONESTLY WE ALWAYS WANT TO GET THE CHINESE NEW COMPUTERS YOU WANT TO GET. SLAP AND HAVE THE KIDS IN THEIR BUT A LOT OF TIMES WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE LEARNING HOW WE'RE TEACHING. A LOT OF TIMES I DO A LOT OF STUFF BASED OFF WERE DOING A BASS ELECTRONICS HOME JUST TO COST WISE I'M IF YOU GET AN OLD COMPUTER. BUILD OUT KIPPER ABOUT ANYWHERE BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY FIVE BUCKS PER KID TEACH BASIC PROGRAMMING ELECTRONICS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE BLOWING OUT RIGHT NOW I HAVE THAT. RIGHT NOW ACTUALLY JUST AGAIN THROUGH SOME OF THE MONEY I GOT AN ORDER FROM SIERRA PRODUCED YEAR COLLEGE AND TO SOME THE STRONG WORK FORCE TO DO A PILOT PROGRAM WITH THAT. WITHOUT WHICH INDICATE GAKI TO EIGHT SCHOOL A WE'VE ALSO DONE PARTNERSHIPS WE JUST FINISHED A ON A HACKATHON WITH UBER IN SAN FRANCISCO WE'VE DONE FIVE PACKET PARENTS OVER THE LAST A THREE YEARS PULLING ABOUT A HUNDRED PLUS KIDS JUST GET JUST ABOUT EVERYONE. I'M I'M LOOKING TO GO AHEAD AND. I'M LOOKING TO GO AHEAD AND. PRO PARLAY OUR LAST PACMAN THIS WE CAN WE TOOK FIFTY KIDS MOSTLY FROM THIS AREA DOWN TO SAN FRANCISCO TO DO HACKATHON BASED ON SIX CYBERSECURITY WITH UBER. I'M LOOKING A ROLL THEM INTO THE GREATER SACRAMENTO URBAN LEGAL PROFESSIONALS THEY OF SERVICES ABLE TWENTY EIGHTH SO ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT WE ARE DOING THE WORK BUT WE NEED TO SUPPORT. ON IT'S ACTUALLY IRONIC THAT CAN HAPPEN TO BE TALKING TODAY BECAUSE I JUST ACTUALLY JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT A TWO HOURS AGO. A THAT I WAS REJECTED FOR THE NEW AMERICA. CALIFORNIA. OF FELLOW PHILIP PROGRAM WHICH I PLAN TO SUPPORT MY EFFORTS THERE BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S YOU KNOW I'M I'M NOT GONNA CRY BASSMAN HAVE ACCESS YOU KNOW. THE THING THAT REALLY STICKS ABOUT IT WAS THAT IT THAT THE STATE YOU KNOW WE HAD A SLICK EIGHT OUT OF APPLE EIGHTY APPLICATION SO I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE. AND SAY OH I SHOULD'VE GOTTEN AS CODE OF A PERSON OF COLOR THIS BUT THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE BIAS IS A LOT OF THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING. AND YOU GET INVITED TO THE PARTY AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE RULES SO A LOT OF THAT IS THIS WITH ALL OF THE SUPPORTING WITH ALL THESE REQUIREMENTS ON PLEASE ARM. KEEP IN MIND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THE WORK A IT GREAT ACOSTA THEMSELVES BUT AGAIN I DON'T WANT YOUR PITY I'M NOT LOOKING FOR THIS I PAY THE PRICE GLAD I MEAN IT'S A CHOICE THAT I MAKE. BUT I JUST WANT TO REMIND ALL OF YOU THAT ARM IT. IF IF WHILE THE IDEAS ALWAYS LIKE THE CHINESE COMPUTERS AND THAT AND WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT THAT WAY. AND IF ANYBODY'S INTERESTED ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO IT YOU KNOW GET SOMETHING DONE WITH THE BUDGETS THAT WE HAVE. I WOULD VERY MUCH ENCOURAGE YOU TO TALK TO MY PARTNER ARE MYSELF AND I'LL SHOW YOU WITH SOME OF THE STUFF THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND THE STORY GOT NOT REALLY A GOOD NUMBERS WYOMING NUMBERS. BUT I'M STORY AND REGION ACROSS WHEN NUMBERS GUY. HOME THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT I COULD SAY ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I PET BUT IT'S GOING TO BE RESPECTFUL OF TIME AND I'M REALLY THANKFUL FOR ALL OF YOU STILL STICKING AROUND TO HEAR ME TALK. ON BELIEVE ME ARM I COULD GO IT LEFT ABOUT ANY OF IT SO HOME YOU GUYS KNOW GINA YOU KNOW HOW TO FIND ME AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVE A PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL OF YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. VERY WELL SAID WELL DONE ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC. OKAY BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU WHAT I FIRST WANT TO THANK OUR PANELISTS FOR BEING HERE OUT FOR THE FOR THIS ONGOING CONVERSATION IT'S A CONVERSATION THAT. I WAS HAPPY STARTED IN SILICON VALLEY AND A FEW MONTHS BACK WITH THAT REALLY HONEST OPEN. OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT DIVERSITY ATTACK IN AND CONCRETE WAYS WE CAN MOVE FORWARD HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER SO I APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT I APPRECIATE THE FOLLOW UP I THINK TODAY'S. CONVERSATION CONTINUES TO BUILD ON WHAT WE'VE STARTED. AND ARM. SPECIFICALLY APPRECIATE SOME OF THE THE INSIGHT TODAY I AM AT GIRLS OF COLOR IN IN IN STEM. I THINK WHAT. WE CONTINUE TO ASK OURSELVES AS LEGISLATORS IS HOW CAN WE BE PRODUCTIVE HELPFUL PARTNERS IN ADDRESSING. I'M EQUITY AND DIVERSITY ATTACK YOU KNOW OTHER BUDGET PRIORITIES WHAT WE CAN HELP FIND OUT INITIATIVES TO HELP BUILD THE PIPELINE FOR FOR FOR GREATER DIVERSITY ARE THE LEGISLATION THAT CAN. REMOVE RESTRICTIONS OR OPEN UP NEW POSSIBILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES SO I JUST WANT TO ASK OUR OUR. PANELIST WHAT ARE SOME THINGS THAT THAT WE CAN DO AS WE COLLECTIVELY HOLD UP THIS ISSUE AND TRY TO ADDRESS IT TOGETHER WHAT CAN OUR ROLE BE WHAT CAN WORK BUT PARK WE DO IN SOLVING THIS ISSUE THAT WE ALL CARE ABOUT DEEPLY. AND AND AND DOM ONE RESOLVE. BUT AS THE BOOK FROM THE K. TWELVE PERSPECTIVE ARM YOU KNOW THERE IS THIS NEW LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA SO THAT A LOT OF THE FUNDING IS SORT OF DIVERSIFIED AND LOCALIZING YOU CAN CHOOSE HOW TO SPEND IT BUT. I YOU KNOW I THINK IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KIND OF SEE THE NUMBERS LIKE WE HAVE BEEN AP AND HONORS COURSES BY ETHNICITY BY GENDER. WITH REGARD TO THE COURSE WORK IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS RIGHT AND WHAT'S NEEDED AND DOOR TO ENCOURAGE MORE GIRLS INSTANCE OF COLOR AND. YOU KNOW THAT YOU KNOW I'M NOT FOR BIG MANDATES ON ON SCHOOLS BUT SHINING THE LIGHT AND SHOWCASING SIR WHAT ARE THE NUMBERS AND AND MAKING SURE THAT THE. TEACHERS AND SCHOOLS LOOK AT THEIR NUMBERS AND AND SEE THAT THAT YOU'RE NOT JUST GRADUATING KIDS BUT WHEN YOU GRADUATING OF THEM AND HOW ARE YOU PASSING THEM THROUGH AND WHOSE PROVIDED. YOU KNOW TUTORING ASSISTANCE ON PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT REALLY IMPORTANT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE OF PARTNER WITH THE. STEMS OPPOSE THE STEAM SUPPOSE IT LAST FIVE YEARS WITH THE CALIFORNIA'S FOR DEDICATED OF EDUCATION FOR A FOUNDATION IS. OF BECAUSE TEACHERS DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO OF YOU KNOW. STREAMLINED ARTICULATE STEM EDUCATOR STEAM EDUCATION IN THE COURSE WORK AND SO WE HAD A CONFERENCE FOR TEACHERS BY TEACHERS AND WE HAVE FIVE THOUSAND. OF OUR EDUCATORS COMEY THOSE CONFERENCES ONCE A YEAR WHICH HAS BEEN A GREAT HELP SO SUPPORT DEFINITELY IMPRESSION OF DEVELOPER FOR UNCONSCIOUS BIAS A BUT ALSO HOW TO MARKET HOW TO PROVIDE THE ASSISTANCE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. OF BECAUSE THAT'S YOU HAVE A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE OF A IT'S A PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AND YOU'LL SEE THE THREE TO ONE TWO TO ONE RATIO OF GIRLS TO BOYS IN THIS. VERY SAME OF SITE I COMPLETELY CAN CURRENTLY BE DIE I'M I THINK AYE AYE THE WAY THAT THAT WE THINK ABOUT THIS IS SORT OF IN FOUR CATEGORIES. READ THE FIRST IS DID YOU KNOW AND I THINK THIS SORT OF GETS TO YOUR FOR YOUR PEACE OF OF EDUCATION. WHAT IS CURRENTLY BEING DONE WHAT IS IT WILL OCCUR WHAT OUR CURRENT PRACTICES WATER BEST PRACTICES? LEARNING FROM THOSE. BUT BUT IT IS IN THAT CATEGORY OF DID YOU KNOW RIGHT. AND THE ACTING TALENT SEARCH RIGHT I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT RECRUITING AND RETENTION. POLICYMAKERS WITH YOUR CONSTITUENTS WORKING TOGETHER. WITH THE COMEDIAN WITH THE INDUSTRY ON TO PROVIDE EXPOSURE. SO THAT SORT OF JUST YOU KNOW WHAT TALENTS OUT THERE WHAT TALENT CAN WE EXPOSE THESE OPPORTUNITIES TO. BUT WORKING TOGETHER IN PARTNERSHIP THEIR. BUILDING THE BATCH RIGHT THIS IS SORT OF THIS THIS CONVERSATION OF THE PIPELINE THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW TECH THAT WAS A CO SPONSOR OF THAT LEGISLATION AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY NINE PASSING TWENTY SIXTEEN. AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY WOMAN BO DNIA. WHICH CREATES A COMPUTER SCIENCE STRATEGIC ADVISORY BOARD THAT PROCESS IS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY AND WE HAVE ONE YEAR TO IDENTIFY WHERE THE GAPS ARE WHAT'S CURRENTLY BEING DONE IN THE AREA OF THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. AND DIVERSITY EXPOSURE TO COMPUTER SCIENCE SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE BUT SORT OF THAT PROCESS AND THAT GETS TO I'M CREATING DIVERSITY AND COMMUNITIES. TEACHER TRAINING RESOURCES CURRICULUM ENHANCEMENT. INCREASE THINKING SOFT SKILLS THE LIST GOES ON AND THE FOURTH PIECE OF THAT. IS DIVERSIFICATION IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN SO. I KNOW THAT VERIZON HAD ALLUDED TO THIS AND I KNOW A NUMBER OF OUR MEMBER COMPANIES ALSO LOOK AT NOT ONLY THEIR OWN INTERNAL BUSINESSES BUT HOW ARE THEY PARTNERING. ALONG THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND WHAT ARE THEIR THAT BEING THE SUPPLY CHAIN FOLKS BEST PRACTICES AROUND DIVERSE CITY. SO THESE ARE SORT OF THE FOUR SO IF YOU LIVE IN AN AREA IN WHICH YOUR HOUSE IS WORTH MORE MONEY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BETTER A BIGGER FLOW OF FUNDS GOING INTO YOUR SCHOOLS. AND THAT NOT ALSO LEADS INTO THE FAMILY DEMOGRAPHICS AS FAR AS HOW ACTIVE THEY ARE BECAUSE WE HAVE A DIFFERENT COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DYNAMIC IN THE HOUSEHOLD. SO LOOKING INTO I'M UNDERSERVED AT COMMUNITIES AND ADDING THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR NOT ONLY EDUCATION TO THE STUDENTS BUT EDUCATION IN THE COMMUNITY OF HOW IMPORTANT STEM AND TECHNOLOGY IS. AMOUNTS WERE MOVING INTO AN AUTONOMOUS WORLD OUR WHOLE WORKFORCE IS GOING TO CHANGE DRAMATICALLY I MEAN AND IF I'M WE'RE NOT READY FOR IT. WE'RE PUSHING AUTONOMOUS CARS WERE WERE PUSHING AUTONOMOUS TRANSPORTATION HERE IN THE CITY WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE BLUE COLLAR WORKERS. EVERYTHING FROM THE ACTUAL DRIVER TO THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY FIXES THE TIRES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO EVEN THE INSURANCE AGENT EVERYTHING'S GOING TO CHANGE DRASTICALLY AND WE ARE NOT READY WE WORK WE ARE READY NOW FOR THE WORK FORCE THAT WE HAVE. WERE DEATHLY NOT GOING TO BE READY IN FIVE TO TEN YEARS SO FUNDING FOR PUTTING FUNDING INTO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES SO WE CANNOT ONLY EDUCATE. THE CHILDREN BUT ALSO THE COMMUNITIES ON THE IMPORTANCE OF IT AND WHAT'S COMING TO CHANGE I'VE I FIND VERY VITAL AND AND SOMETHING THAT EXTREME PORTENTS RIGHT NOW. APPRECIATE ALL THE RESPONSES I JUST WANNA SAY THAT AS AS CHAIR OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I'VE BEEN. REALLY EXCITED TO BE PART CONVERSATION WITH YOU AND REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. OUR THE HONESTY AND OPENNESS IN THE AND THE WILLINGNESS TO WORK TOGETHER IN THE FOR TO OUR ONGOING WORK TOGETHER THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY WELL THEN I WILL CLOSE THIS UP IN. AS WAS A THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY THAT CAME TODAY APOLOGIZES A FEW MINUTES LATER IT WAS INCREDIBLE CONVERSATION IT AND I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE. THE ETHNIC MINORITY. PART OF THIS BUT WHAT I CAN'T SPEAK TO AS A FATHER OF TWO LITTLE GIRLS. THAT ARE SIX I'M SORRY HER BIRTHDAY'S TODAY. SO THEY ARE NINE AND EIGHT TODAY. AND SO IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO ME AS MY DAUGHTERS GROW UP THAT EVERY OPPORTUNITY THAT THEY WANT TO. DO WHEN LIFE IS AFFORDED TO THEM AND WHEN YOU DOUBLE THAT WITH THAT. UNETHICAL MINORITY ASPECT TO THIS AND IT MAKES IT EVEN HARDER IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. AND SO AS A COMMITTEE WE ARE ABSOLUTELY. CHALLENGED TO FIXING THIS PROBLEM AND I LOOK FORWARD TO FIND A SOLUTION SO THANK YOU THERE'S NO OTHER COMMENTS WE'LL CLOSE THIS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU
