INTERESTING CONVERSATION. APPLE CONVERSATION YESTERDAY BUT A IN THE GLUTTON EXPLOITATION. A LOT OF- WHAT'S CALLED NEGLECT OF ELDERS WHO ARE HAVING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES A RESOURCE CHALLENGES INCREASING FINANCIAL ABUSE REALLY- CHALLENGES THERE. AND THEN OF COURSE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS. TEAMS WE HEAR A LOT REALLY QUICKLY- DIVERSITY AGAIN UP A BOTH RACIAL ETHNIC AND IMMIGRANT RURAL URBAN AND LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL COMMUNITIES. COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS FROM DEMENTIA TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. TECHNOLOGY HOW TECHNOLOGIES BOTH DESTRUCTING CHANGING AGING. WORK FORCE ME CONNIE. AND IMPORTANCE OF CROSS GENERATIONAL CONNECTIONS WITH CHILDREN AGING THIS IS NOT A MASTER PLAN FOR OLD PEOPLE I OFTEN SAY IT'S A MASTER PLAN FOR ALL OF US AS WE AGE ACOSTA LIKE SPAM. COLLABORATION SUPPORT ALL OF OUR OTHER INITIATIVE PRECLUDED ALZHEIMER'S TASK FORCE BUT ALSO HOUSING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HEALTH CARE AGING IS EVERYWHERE- AND WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS THE TRANSFORMATION OF CDA WHICH ALL DRESSED IN A- FUTURE. SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO- IMPLEMENTING CONTINUE TO BE A LEADER PARTNER IN THE SPACE. ANY COMMENTS FROM OHIO. WE'VE BEEN MONITORING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MASTER PLAN ATTENDING THE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS A LOT GOING ON- SO WHEN THE REPORT IS RELEASED IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY AT THE END OF THE MONTH- WILL FOR SURE BE READING THAT MONITORING FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AS WE REACH THAT OCTOBER DEADLINE- BUT THEN ALSO WILL BE LOOKING FOR TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW CURRENT BUDGET RELATED PROPOSALS THAT HAVE A SENIOR PERSON WITH DISABILITY AND PACKED LIKE CAL AMY WILL TRULY CONNECT WITH THE BROADER MASTER PLAN. YOU FINANCE. COMMENTS NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD AT THIS TIME MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT OPTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SO ACTUALLY. SELECT EQUAL ACTUALLY THE SAID YOU WERE GOING TO US CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THE- THE IN TERMS OF THE TRANSFORMATION CDA SURE THAT THE PART OF AGING THANK YOU FOR OUT WE HAVE LARGELY BEEN- OVERSIGHT AGENCY OF SOME CRITICAL AGING FUNDING- BUT REALLY- BECAUSE AGING IS CHANGING IT CALLS FOR NEW STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THAT APARTMENT SO WE'VE- IN IN PROCESS TO FINALIZE THAT LOOKING OUT FOR GOALS WHICH ONE IS TO IMPLEMENT THE STATE'S MASTER PLAN FOR AGING. ONE IS TO DELIVER QUALITY SERVICES ONE IS TO ENGAGE AROUND AGE WHICH IS OUR- SHORTHAND FOR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND EDUCATION AWARENESS AND MOLASSES TO MODERNIZE CDA WE RELEASE ON DEVELOPING QUALITY- DELIVERING QUALITY SERVICES WERE WORKING A LOT ON STREAMLINING- MODERNIZINGEVERYTHING FROM CONTRACTING OVERSTATE TO OUR ALLOCATION. I AM WORKING WORKING ARE PARTNERS TO KICK OFF A PROCESS WHERE. TENTATIVELY PLAYING TRIPLE A TO OUT OF TRIPLE A STRUCTURE WAS CREATED THE SEVENTIES IN CALIFORNIA WE CREATED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY. AND WE ALL AGREE IT'S TIME FOR A FRESH LOOK TO MAKE SURE WE ARE READY AS STATE AND LOCAL LEADERS AND PARTNERS. TO LEAD- INTO THE NEXT DECADES AS AGING CHANGES SO MUCH AROUND US SO THAT'S EXCITING WORKING IN IN MODERNIZING CDA. WE'RE WORKING REALLY HARD TO DIVERSIFY WILL BE- ENGAGING IN THE GOVERNANCE GOVERNOR. GOVERNMENT ALLIANCE RACIAL EQUITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AS A STAFF ARE REPRESENTING- THE BEST OF CALIFORNIA AND ABLE TO SERVE CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE POPULATION AND WE ARE ALSO LOOKING TO MOVE INTO A MORE MODERN ACCESSIBLE AND WELCOMING. BUILDING WITH WIFI AND THINGS LIKE THAT- AND MICHAEL WE CAN. UPDATE THOSE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE NEXT PC PETERS GOSH. SO CAN YOU JUST PERHAPS ELABORATE SO YOU SAID YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT- TRIPLE A TO POINT OUT RIGHT SO. HOW TO USE- SO WHERE SOME THE THOUGHTS ABOUT. OUR LOCAL- TO BLAZE AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE DEPARTMENT WITH THEM GOING TO THE FUTURE SO I MEAN AS YOU SAID YOUR- TO RE IMAGINING THIS SIR- AND IF HE'D TRAPS ELABORATE A LITTLE MORE ON WHAT SOME OF THE THOUGHTS ARE IDEAS THAT ARE BEING. DISCUSSED ENTERTAIN IN RELATION TO THE ROLE OF THE TRIPLE A.'S- AND THIS NEW THE PART YOU KNOW FAR REACHING. CONVERSATIONS HAVE I HAVE BEGUN WITH OUR MANY OF OUR PARTNERS ON THIS BOTH IN THE IN THE COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE AND NATIONALLY- YOU KNOW AGAIN- WITH AGING GROWING THE NUMBERS AND THE CHANGING NATURE OF AGING YOU REALLY WANT TO BE SURE THE POST CDA IN THE LOCAL TRIPLE. ARE PUT TO BE THAT STRONG LEADER PART. SO OF THE WE WANT TO. SERVICE AREA. AND WHETHER THAT'S THE RIGHT NUMBER GIVEN POP. CHANGES IS ONE OF THAT ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS. YOU ALSO WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT FOR TRIPLE A.'S TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND SUCCESSFUL IS THAT THERE ARE THREE RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE CRITICAL ONE IS WITH THE COUNTY. HOW COUNTY SERVICES TO AGING DISABLED ONE IS WITH LOCAL LIVABLE COMMUNITY MOVEMENTS- SOMETIMES H. FRIENDLY COMMUNITIES HOW ARE THEY IMPACTING EIGHT. HOUSING TRANSPORTATION KEY INDICATORS OF AGE FRIENDLY. AND INCREASE ONLY A THIRD RELATIONSHIPS HEALTH PLANS HOW ARE HEALTH AND- A MORE SOCIAL TERMINATE HEALTH PROGRAMS A TRIPLE A TRADITIONALLY WORK AND WORKING SEAMLESSLY. TO DEVELOP THE BEST DELIVER THE BEST HEALTH OUTCOMES PARTICULARLY SUPPORTING LIVING AT HOME AND COMMUNITY. SO WITH THOSE KIND OF HIGH LEVEL- CONSIDERATIONS WE WILL BE ENGAGING THE TRIPLE A.'S- AND THEY'RE INTERESTED LEADERS AND THINKING THROUGH WHAT IS THAT. CALIFORNIA FOR THE SECOND IT'S- I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT- THE ON THIS COMMITTEE ACTUALLY- I GUESS NOW THAT A- PRIVATE YEAR YEARS LITTLE MORE NEW YEAR AGO ACTUALLY- HELD A HEARING. ON THE DEMOGRAPHICS FOR AGING POPULATION- MORE IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT- MULTI ESTO LONG TERM SUPPORT. SERVICES SERVICES SUPPORTS AND- MAKING NOTE THAT AS OF NOW FROM BUDGETARY STANDPOINT THAT- ADMIT THAT CAME AFTER PRESENTATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND FINANCE THAT SAID THAT THEY WEREN'T REALLY LOOKING OUT TO THE FUTURE IN TERMS OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND ITS IMPACT ON THE BUDGET SO. WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT HEARING APPRECIATE THE INPUT OF THE LA- DOING SOME HOUSES FOR THAT. AND RECOGNIZING THAT- YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BE BETTER PREPARED- FOR- FOR AGING POPULATION- AND- APPRECIATE THAT- SUBSEQUENT TO THAT THE GOVERNOR THEN IN THIS STATE OF STATE ADDRESS LAST YEAR TALKED ABOUT AGING CELL CERTAINLY HERE IN THE SENATE. BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE WE PREVIOUSLY HAD UNDER. CENTER CAROL LOOP SELECT COMMITTEE ON AGING AS WELL WHO. SOME REALLY FOR IMPORT THAT GROUNDBREAKING WERE. AS WELL. LIKE FOLLOW UP SO FOR THE FASTER WE- MILLION DOLLARS FOR AN ACTUARIAL STUDY I AUTHORED BILL RELATION TO THAT I KNOW THE YOU SEE. THERE'S RECOMMENDED. THE TAP. FOR TSS CAN CATCH A ON. WE EXPECT. WHEN X. TO SEE THIS. SOME RESULTS FROM THE ACTUAL STAIRS IS THAT GONNA COURT ANY IN THE MARCH REPORT AT FOUR OUT WHEN DO SO I KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT LIKE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SERVICES IT'S ADDRESS SO. HE GIVE ME A SENSE OF TIMELINE ON WHEN WE MIGHT GET- THIS. FEASIBILITY ACTUAR ANALYSIS OF CELSIUS AS FINANCING YES I CAN GIVE YOU A HIGH LEVEL IT'S ACTUALLY BEING HANDLED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO THE HIGHEST LEVEL WERE EXPECTING THE REPORT FROM THE CONTRACTOR THIS SUMMER. BUT WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH MORE DETAILS SPECIFICITY AROUND THAT. I YOU'LL SEE THE STAKEHOLDER REPORT DOES INCLUDE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT UNIVERSAL PUBLIC BENEFIT- BUT THOSE THAT THAT DATA ANALYSIS FROM THE ACTUAR ALSO IS NOT YET AVAILABLE OKAY BUT THAT'S ON GOING RIGHT NOW INSPECTED SOMETIME IN THE SUMMER PERHAPS ALL RIGHT. WE WILL CONSULTANT FIRM ON THAT OKAY AND APPRECIATE THAT. AND THEN WHEN ACTUALLY WHEN THE OTHER- THINGS THAT I WANT TO ALSO TOUCH ON IS AND THIS IS MORE IN THE OVERVIEW SECTION- BUT- THE- AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CONNECTION- BOTH. I UNDERSTAND THAT.

OUR SENIORS WHO AREN'T FACILITIES CAN CAN ABSOLUTELY CAN TURN TO SELF PRECIADO THE MOST KEEP WORKING ON THAT RIGHT LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NUMBER TWO ISSUE TO WHICH IS THE B. C. P. ON THE HEADQUARTERS RELOCATION FUNDING. A YES SO JUST TO SUMMARIZE- THIS B. C. P. IS IT TO FIND THE RELOCATION- OF- THE PHARMACY AGING AS WELL AS THE COMMISSION ON AGING TO TRY PROPOSAL- IT'S TWO POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND WHICH IS ONE TIME AND SIX HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. ON GOING TO MEET THOSE NEEDS THE ONE TIME WILL BE FOR EQUIPMENT AND OTHER EXPENSES THAT ARE ONE TIME IN NATURE FURNITURE- AND THINGS LIKE THAT ASSOCIATED WITH ACTUAL YOUR LOCATION. THE ADDITIONAL ON BRING MONIES WILL BE TO COVER THE INCREASE AND RENT EXPENSES- CDA AS WELL AS YOU SEE I HAVE BEEN LOCATED OUR CURRENT FACILITY FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS- IT'S CURRENTLY IN A STATE OF DISREPAIR. THERE ARE HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES BIG TRUCK ISSUES- IN ADDITION TO IT NO LONGER MEETS OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL NEEDS IT NO LONGER HAS TO BE REQUIRED- WE'VE GONE SO FAR AS TO START CONVERTING SHARED SPACES AND MEETING SPACE.

THERE WE REQUIRE TO DO OUR BUSINESS AND TO DO IT WELL AND NOT JUST TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO. THANK YOU VALUE. REVIEW THE B. C. B. AND I'M NOT CONCERNED FINANCE BECOMES. NOTHING FURTHER AT THIS TIME THANK YOU I THANK YOU COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS- SO I JUST TO CLARIFY THE- ONGOING IS FOR BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE IN RENTS AND I UNDERSTAND FROM WHAT YOUR DESCRIPTION IS PROBABLY LARGER SPACE ETCETERA. MAYBE IT'S MORE A QUESTION FOR DDS BUT DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG THE LEASES- WE ARE NEGOTIATING THAT RIGHT NOW- BUT OUR INITIAL PROPOSED TERM IS SEVEN YOUR FIRM- FOURTEEN YOUR WHOLE. OKAY I'M LEASES SO IT'LL BE THAT SEVEN YOUR FIRM SEVEN YOUR SOFT OKAY ALL RIGHT. BECAUSE I REPRESENTS SACRAMENTO I'VE LOW MORE FAMILIAR TO YOU AT SOME OF THAT SO I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A LONG. LONG TERM LEASE AND SOME OF THESE VERY SHORT LEASES WHERE WE CAN HAVE MORE TIES THE IMPROVEMENTS SAID THAT ACTUALLY CAUSES OR RENT TO BE A LOT HIGHER THAN IT NEEDS TO BE. SOME HAPPY TO HEAR THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LONGER TERM LEASE THAN A ULTRA SHORT WANT. THAT OKAY. ALL RIGHT WE SHOULD THAT OKAY NO THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE WHICH IS ACTUALLY A PROPOSAL FOR INVESTMENT SO I'M GONNA ASK YOU JUSTICE AND WHEN THE STAY PUT AND THEN IF PLEASE COME UP- SO WE HAVE- THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION AREA EIGHT. AGENCIES ON AGING- THE REQUEST YES PLEASE COME UP TO THE- TABLE HERE. I LIKE THAT THE AGENCY STAY AT THE TABLE BECAUSE THEY MIGHT. I HAVE I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR THEM ABOUT IT SO. OKAY RIGHT WELCOME IF YOU CAN INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND THEN ASK IF YOU CAN. KEEP YOUR PRESENTATION TO THREE MINUTES LESS THAN THREE MINUTES IS FINE TOO SO I'M QUITE CAMPY AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE TRIPLE A OF SANTA CRUZ AND SAN BENITO COUNTY. AND A MEMBER OF THE MASTER PLAN I STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEE. SO FIRST OFF I WANT TO THANK BOTH OF YOU FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED LEGISLATIVELY IN TERMS OF JUSTICE. PRIEST INTEREST IN AGING ISSUES IN MOVING THAT TOPIC FORWARD. AND THE PROPOSAL THAT I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT IS SPECIFIC TO EIGHTY R. C. SO THANKS FOR CARING THAT ALSO. SO HOW ON WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT ALREADY AND EIGHTY OR SEIZE ARE REALLY THE HUB OF A NO WRONG DOOR SYSTEM. IN WALL GETTING ACCESS TO SERVICES ISN'T ALWAYS THE SEXIEST THING OUT THERE IT'S NOT A SEXY IS HOME DELIVERED MEALS FOR EXAMPLE IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST CRITICAL. BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND SERVICES THEY DON'T EXIST SO THE EIGHTY R. C. MODEL IS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS IN THE WAY WE BUT ALL DREAM IT TO HAPPEN AND SENATOR I KNOW I'M PREACHING TO THE CHOIR WITH YOU ABOUT THIS. BUT IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE DO IN TERMS OF MAKING ALL THE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AVAILABLE AND MAKING THEM WORK BETTER AND HAVING THEM BETTER COORDINATED WITH EACH OTHER. SO THE BILL LAST YEAR THAT THE SENATOR KERRY HAS RESULTED IN THEIR BEING NOW SIX FULLY OPERATIONAL ADR SEASON THE STATE AND TEN THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS A MERGING WHICH MEANS A YEAR FROM NOW. HOPEFULLY I'LL BE HERE SAYING THEY ARE NOW SIXTEEN EIGHTY ARE SEIZE FULLY OPERATIONAL. THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS WE THINK THIS IS JUST EXTREMELY VALUABLE. AND IN ORDER TO MOVE THAT NUMBER FROM TEN OR SIX TO SIXTEEN AND THEN HOPEFULLY TO FIFTY EIGHT WE HAVE ONE IN EVERY COMPANY THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A CONTINUED INVESTMENT. SO THIS BUDGET ALSO IS TO CONTINUE THE INVESTMENTS TO CREATE MORE ADRS THESE. PROCESS ANOTHER. SO THE PROPOSAL YOU'LL SEE IT'S BROKEN DOWN INTO THREE YEARS WITH THAT REALIZATION NOT EVERYBODY WILL DO THIS OVERNIGHT WE'RE ASKING FOR NINETEEN MILLION AN ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR. THE COMING FISCAL YEAR THIRTY MILLION IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND FIFTY ONE MILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE WHICH WE THINK WE'LL GET. THE PROGRAM ESTABLISHED STATEWIDE I CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAME UP WITH THOSE DOLLARS THE SHORT ANSWER TO IT IS THAT WE WANT TO HAVE BASS LINE FUNDS FOR EVERY EIGHTY R. C. SO THEY CAN KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY OPEN THE DOORS. AND HAVE A MINIMUM NUMBER STAFF TO ANSWER THE PHONE CALLS TO RUN THE PROGRAM AND MAYBE MORE IMPORTANTLY NETWORK WITH THE COMMUNITY OF OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS BECAUSE THE MODEL ISN'T JUST HAVING ONE CENTER THAT EVERYBODY GOES TO. BUT HAVING YOUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY HOOKED IN WITH THAT CENTER IN IF NOT BEING ABLE TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS FOR WHERE TO GET SERVICES NO ONE ENTITY TO GO TO GET THEM FROM. SO THERE'S DIFFERENT CAPACITIES OF THAT BUT WE ALSO REALIZE THAT LARGER POPULATION AREAS NEED A LOT MORE STAFF THAN WHEN IT JUST TAKES TO OPEN THE DOOR SO WE HAVE A WAITED FORMULA THAT- ESTIMATES THE NUMBER OF USERS BASED ON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE POPULATION FIGURES. TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY AB R. C. CANNOT ONLY OPEN THEIR DOOR BUT ONCE THEY'RE OPEN THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT OPERATION SO WE LOOK AT YOU KNOW POTENTIAL. SERVE ON OF ALL ADULTS AND PEOPLE JUST BILL. ON THE CLOSING I WOULD MAKE IS ON MONDAY MASTER PLAN FOR AGING LOOKED AT THE P. L. TSS SUBCOMMITTEE REPORT LOOK AT. THINGS COULD IMPLEMENT NOW BECAUSE JUST YOU SAID WE WANT TO WAIT FOR EVER FOR THAT PLAN TO COME OUT AND TAKE ACT. AND THIS WAS DONE OF ARTISTS AND OF THOSE TWO THAT READY TO GO NOW I. WANT A IN. AND ASK FOR THE OTHER POLLS AND COMMON. OKAY THANK YOU. I DO. THOSE BUT IT. STATION PROPOSAL BUT AT ANY FROM DEPARTMENT OF AGING ABOUT THE FOR. A LA. IN FINANCE. ALL RIGHT QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SO I DID I DO HAVE A QUESTION TO AND APPRECIATE YOUR DESCRIPTION. IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING FOR EIGHTY ARE SEIZE JUST CLARIFY IS THAT TOTALLY STATE FUNDED OR WE ABLE TO DRAW DOWN MATCHING FUNDS ANY FEDERAL SUPPORT BECAUSE I KNOW THE STATUS OF FEDERAL DEMONSTRATION GRANT BACK IN WAS A TWO THOUSAND AND NINE BUT SINCE THEN. SO CAN I JUST SO THIS IS THIS GOING TO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE FUNDED SOLELY THROUGH STATE FUNDS ARE WE LOOKING AT BE ABLE TO DRAW DOWN ANY FEDERAL OR OTHER SOURCES OF MONEY. TO CURRENTLY EIGHTY R. C. IS FUNDED- SOLELY BY GENERAL FUND- BUT- DEPARTMENT IS WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH DH CS AS WELL AS OUR PARTNERS- TRIPOLI'S ANTI FOR A TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY- MEDI CAL ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMING- TO SEE IF WE CAN DO SOME DRAW DOWN TO OFFSET SOME OF THOSE COSTS FOR THE- PROGRAM OKAY- AND THEN CHOOSE THAT AND AGAIN I GUESS- IN TERMS OF A TECHNICAL STANDPOINT- IS. THIS PROPOSAL A GIVEN YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF EIGHTY ARE SEIZE REFLECTIVE OF THE COSTS THAT WOULD IT TAKE TO GET TO THEY'RE PROPOSING FIFTY EIGHT EIGHTY ARE SEES AS IT THIS THIS SEEMS TO BE IN SCALE WITH THAT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE PART OF AGING I AND IF YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT HAPPENED YET YEAH BUT OKAY. PROCESS OF LOOKING AT THAT WITH PARTNERSHIP WORK THAT WENT INTO IT OKAY I'M DENTURE DE SSE ASIAN HAS SOME PRETTY GOOD IDEAS TOO BUT I DO WANNA POSSESSES APARTMENT TO IN TERMS OF THEIR PERSPECTIVE OKAY. FROM A TECHNICAL POINT OF VIEW- ALL RIGHT SENATOR IF IT JUST YET THE FRONT OF IT IT WILL BE LOOKING FOR IS ALSO LOCAL FUNDS ON BEFORE PARTNER CANADIAN SEE TYPICALLY INVOLVES A NUMBER PROGRAM SO SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE. AT LEAST PARTIAL EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THE EIGHTY ARE C. WOULD BUILD ON OKAY. AND CERTAINLY PM WANT TO TED HAVING HUBS IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE SO WE CAN HAVE ANOTHER PROBLEM OR PEOPLE GET YET THE SERVICES NOTICED FIGHTING SERVICES WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T FIND THEM SELL RIGHT HELP. OKAY THE OTHER QUESTIONS THE OKAY ALL RIGHT SO WE ARE PUTTING EVERYTHING PULLED RIGHT NOW SO THE SO WE GET MAY REVISE PRETTY MUCH- SO THANK HIS ROOM. FOR YOUR PRESENT. THANK YOU. OKAY SO WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND- CAN. YOU CAN DO AT THE REST OF YOU CAN STAY. FROM A WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEN SEE THE ANY OTHER. FINAL QUESTIONS FROM THE- SO WILL. PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND WE THE MIKE ON OKAY. NAME IN THEN YES WELCOME. AND ARE YOU SURE BECAUSE- THE WHOLE LINE FALLS AT IS A MICRO ON. THAT'S UP LIKE IN A PROBLEM OKAY LET'S LET'S OF THEM IN THE BECAUSE I TO BE SURE WE WERE BE SURE WE HEAR EVERYONE. THAT'S OKAY. WE ROUND RIGHT. SENATOR PENN AS YOUR CONSTITUENTS YES A MAN IS WATCHING THE MASTER PLAN THROUGH THERE IN THIRTY FIVE PEOPLE AND THE FACT THAT IT STARTED OUT WITH TWO COMMITTEES IN IS GONNA INVOLVED IN TWO SEVEN. PLUS THROUGH THERE I WILL SAY ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS IS NEEDED THE IS A TOTAL INTERNET CONNECTION FOR THE STATE. YOU NEED TO GET FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AT LEAST TO START OFF WITH FUNDING- THROUGH THERE AND YOU NEED TO GET IT STARTED NOW BECAUSE YOU'RE EXPECTING FIVE MILLION BUT KNOW THAT THAT WILL DOUBLE AND DOUBLE. PROBABLY THIS IS THE COMMUNITY THAT'S GOTTEN OF THE THIRTY YEARS OF LIFE EXPECTANCY RIGHT NOW. I'M LIKE WHAT WILL BE IN THE FUTURE. FOLLOWING IS INCREDIBLY CRITICAL- SO THE PREVENTION PROGRAMS OF THAT AS WELL AS THE OTHER THING TO KEEP IN ONE LOCATION AND I KNOW THERE'S MORE BUT A ONE MINUTE I'M TRYING TO SOLVE IDENTIFY MYSELF IS JEFF STARTED YEAR.

SO THANK YOU. HI GOOD MORNING YES YOU HAVE A POWER POINT THAT WAS HANDED OUT TO ALL- KIND OF GO THROUGH THAT QUICKLY AND THEN IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS HAPPY TO RESPOND TO THOSE. SO I THINK YOU'RE ALL IN HIS THROAT. I THINK YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH IDEA TO SET AND WHO WE SERVE WE SERVE ELDERLY AND DISABLED INDIVIDUALS. HOW WE'RE FUNDED- WE RECEIVE. MEDICAID DOLLARS FOR ABOUT 98% OF OUR POPULATION AND FOR THE REMAINING TWO THAT'S THE STATE COUNTY FUNDED PROGRAM A LITTLE UNDER 2% FOR THE RESIDUAL PROGRAM. THE BUDGET FOR THIS NEXT YEAR IS PROJECTED AT FOURTEEN POINT NINE BILLION. WE DID HAVE NEW AMMO LEASE- FUNDING STRUCTURE THAT BEGAN IN NINETEEN TWENTY I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT AS A PART OF THE NEXT SECTION HERE SO. I'LL GO FOR SKIP ON THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT WHICH WAS IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO NOW TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WHICH INTRODUCED OVER TIME TO OUR PROVIDERS WE WANTED TO PROVIDE. A LITTLE BIT OF UPDATE ON VIOLATIONS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU OFTEN INTERESTED IN AND YOU'LL SEE WE'VE SPLIT OUT BETWEEN PAPER TIME SHEETS AN ELECTRONIC- VERSIONS WE JUST WANTED TO SHARE AS WE'RE MOVING TO THE ELECTRONIC- FORMAT FOR SUBMISSION OF TIME THAT THAT HAS BEEN A REAL BENEFIT TO- SUPPORT. OUR PROVIDE IN NOT INCURRING VIOLATIONS SO IF YOU LOOK TO DECEMBER NINETEEN ON THE NEXT TWO PAGES OR THE PAPER. REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE USING PAPER AS THEY TRANSITION SO WE HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND AND THEY THEY AND KURT ABOUT ONE POINT THREE OF THEM. A 3% OF THEM IN KERN A VIOLATION. WHEREAS IF YOU LOOK AT THE NEXT PAGE WITH ELECTRONIC TIME SHE'S ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND- PROVIDERS WERE USING THE ELECTRONIC METHOD. AND ABOUT POINT THREE PERCENT- RECEIVED A VIOLATION THAT'S BECAUSE BOTH THE TELEPHONE SOLUTION AND THE ELECTRONIC PUMP UP PORTAL ONLINE. PROVIDE REAL TIME PROBLEMS AS PEOPLE ARE COMPLETING THEIR TIME SHEETS AND NOT HAS BEEN A REAL BENEFIT. ON THE NEXT SLIDE SHARES WITH YOU KIND OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH OUR POPULATION OBVIOUSLY GROWING PROJECTED AUTHORIZED CASES FOR THE NEXT YEAR IS ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND. FOUR PROVIDERS WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE THOUSAND. THE NEXT TO SLIDE GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BREAK DOWN WE'RE WE'RE SHARING BY AGE THAT SEEMS TO GIVE A BETTER PICTURE THAN JUST AGED BLIND AND DISABLED WHICH IS ALWAYS A LITTLE DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING TO. CLARIFY SO YOU'LL SEE ABOUT FORTY FIVE APPROXIMATELY 45% OF FOLKS ARE UNDER SIXTY FIVE AND ABOUT 55% OF FOLKS ARE OVER SIXTY FIVE. ABOUT 15% ARE EIGHTY FIVE AND OLDER AND ABOUT 8% ARE MINORS. THEN WE PROVIDED A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PROVIDERS AND- ABOUT FIFTY ALMOST 54% LIVE WITH THEIR RECIPIENTS. ABOUT 80% WORK FOR ONE RECIPIENT AND- ALMOST 20% WORK FOR MORE THAN ONE RECIPIENT. THE NEXT PAGE PROVIDES A LITTLE BIT INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RELATIVE PROVIDERS SO YOU'LL SEE ALL- A LITTLE OVER 72% OF OUR PROVIDERS ARE RELATIVES AND THAT GIVES YOU THE BREAK OUT OF. THAT THE RELATIONSHIPS. DOES THE TALKS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SICK LEAVE THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED NOW BACK IN- JULY OF EIGHTEEN. IT'S BEEN GOING FINE- THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IN THIS AREA IS REALLY EDUCATING PEOPLE THAT IT'S A OF ITON ITS AVAILABILITY AND USAGE SOME OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THAT AREA TO ASSIST WITH THAT IS THAT WE DO SEND OUT ANNUAL NOTIFICATIONS AND WE ALSO AS PEOPLE ARE TRANSITIONING INTO THE ELECTRONIC FORMAT FOR SUBMITTING TIME. THEY'RE ABLE TO SUBMIT THEIR SICK TIME THERE AND THEY CAN SEE THAT IN THE PORTAL WE WILL BE ABLE TO. POST INFORMATION IN THE PORTAL AND EMAIL INFORMATION OUT TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL EDUCATION TO PEOPLE OF ABOUT THAT AVAILABLE BENEFIT SO HOPEFULLY THAT USAGE WILL COME UP. THIS NEXT FISCAL YEAR THEY WILL BE GETTING SIXTEEN HOURS INSTEAD OF THAT SO UP FROM THE AGE WHERE WE STARTED. THE ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION- SO WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF TRêN TRANSITION WITHOUT WE BEGAN WITH OUR PILOT IN JULY AND LA COUNTY WHICH WENT. REALLY WELL WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL LA COUNTY IS 99% OF THEIR PROVIDERS AND RECIPIENTS HAVE TRANSITION TO THE ELECTRONIC. VISIT VERIFICATION TOOL- WE ARE IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REMAINDER OF THE COUNTIES WHICH ARE BEING DONE IN WAVES TO MONTH WAVES THE FIRST ONE WAS IN JANUARY FEBRUARY THE SECOND ONE IS BEGINNING NOW MARCH APRIL- ABOUT. JUST ABOUT 80% OF RECIPIENTS SOME PROVIDERS ARE CURRENTLY TRANSITION TO AN ELECTRONIC- BOB PROCESS FOR SUBMITTING THEIR TIME SO WE'RE WE'RE MOVING ALONG WITH THAT WELL- THE IT GIVES YOU THE SCHEDULE THERE OF- THE REMAINDER OF THE COUNTIES. AND THE LAST THING WE WANT TO COVER WAS THE NEW MANDATE TO MOVE TO DIRECT DEPOSIT OR PAY CARD ON THE THAT IS EFFECTIVE JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WE HAVE. ALMOST A YEAR AND A HALF BEFORE THAT GOES INTO A FACT THAT SOMETHING THAT WE ARE WORKING ON IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ROLLOUT FOR ELECTRONIC TIME SHEETS TO EDUCATE PEOPLE THAT. I HAVE FOUND THAT PEOPLE USING ELECTRONIC ON BOTH ENDS ARE GETTING PAID WITHIN THREE OR FOUR DAYS TYPICALLY. SO THAT'S A REAL BENEFIT FOR OUR PROVIDERS- YOU'LL SEE AND THE LAST PAGE CHART THAT IT SHOWS ABOUT. 56% AND THE MOST RECENT I SAW WAS A LITTLE OVER 61% OF PROVIDERS HAVE ALREADY TRANSITIONS TO. AN ELECTRONIC- MODE OF PAYMENT AS WELL. MAKE INCOME IS FROM LA ON THE REVIEW. WE'VE REVIEWED THE- I JUST AS BUDGET ESTIMATES AND OVERALL REYES NO MAJOR CONCERNS THERE ARE A FEW AREAS IN WHICH WE FLAG TO THAT ESTIMATES MAY BE DIFFERENT- IN MAY WHEN WE GET MOST UP TO DATE DATA SPECIFICALLY HOURS PER CASE IN THE CAR HERE ARE WITH US MADE IN NINETEEN TWENTY MAYBE HIGHER. JUST GIVEN THAT AVERAGE ANNUAL GROWTH ALWAYS BEEN BROWN OR HAS RECENTLY BEEN 2% BUT IN THE BUDGET IT'S RELATIVELY FLAT WHEN YOU COMPARE TO EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LEVELS BUT THEN ALSO PAID SICK LEAVE UTILIZATION I'M GETTING BETTER ESTIMATES ON THAT TO THEN DETERMINE WHAT UTILIZATION WOULD LOOK LIKE IN THE OUT YEARS REFLECT THAT AS WELL. A MORE LONG TERM THING THAT WE WOULD MONITOR IS THE NEW POLICY OF EXPANDING LIKE HELL TO ON CAN SEE. THE AND THAT WOULD BY JUST SAYS THE THAT WILL BE LOOKING FOR INFO YEARS GETTING BETTER UNDERSTANDING THOSE ASSESSMENTS. THANK YOU FINANCED. I CAN JUST STEP CAN. WHERE YOU KNOW. THE MAY REVISIONS. WE WILL BE A WORKING WITH THIRD. SOCIAL SIR. TARA YOU KNOW CASELOAD COSTS- HOURS PER CASE- SO YOU WILL BUT THERE WILL BE AN UPDATE AT ME REVISION. BASED ON YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL DATA. THANK YOU. RIGHT QUESTIONS FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY SO I DID A FEW QUESTIONS SO I THINK IS ONLY A REFERENCE TO THE IN TERMS OF- THE SO WE HAVE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF CASES RIGHT AGING POPULATION- MORE PEOPLE WHO NEED THAT SUPPORT BUT ALSO THE HOURS PER CASES ALSO BEEN INCREASING. CAN YOU NOW WELL IT'S- THE CAN YOU ELABORATE ON PERHAPS THAT MEANS THAT DO YOU HAVE SOME IDEA OF THIS TO WHY THE HOURS PER CASE IS ALSO INCREASING AS WELL. SO THAT MEANS THAT NOT ONLY OF COURSE IT MORE PEOPLE TAKE CARE OF THE FAMILY NEED MORE SERVICES ARE MORE. DID OUT OF THIS INCREASE INTENSITY OR SOME OTHER THINGS SO CAN HE SPEAK TO THAT I CAN CERTAINLY START TO IN MY OWN BUT MAYBE YOU CAN SPEAK TO WITH THE S. AND DO YOU HAVE SOME DATA ON THAT. I THINK SAID A PORTION OF IT COMES FROM THAT- NOT ONLY ARE PEOPLE AGING BUT ALSO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE AGING AND AS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AGE THEN IF THERE IS THAT. MORE EXTENSIVE SERVICES- NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE. WE ALSO ARE. SEEING MORE CHILDREN OF ARE SO LIKE PROTECTIVE SUPER WITH ASH BURGERS AUTISM THOSE KINDS OF ON DISABILITIES AND- I THINK THOSE ARE SOME OF WHAT PLEASE INTO THAT IT IS AN AREA WE ARE WEAK WE CONTINUE TO WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR COUNTY IS TO ENSURE THAT- THE- ASSESSMENT TOOLS ARE UTILIZED IN A GOOD WAY. LAKE ACCURATE A BOMB. AND SO THAT THINGS ARE DONE AS CONSISTENTLY AS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE BOARD AND SO THAT WE'RE ABLE TO CLEARLY UNDERSTAND. WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH OURS WITH OUR SERVICE LEVELS OKAY EMPTORIS BECAUSE WE'RE MOVING TO LIKE TRYING VISIT VERIFICATION AND I KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS IN THE PAST ABOUT THIS BURDENS INS ISSUES BUT I WAS ALSO WONDERING IS YOU'RE TRANSITIONING PEOPLE FROM PAPER TO THE TRIBE VERIFICATION. IT SEEMS LIKE BASED ON WHAT YOU PRESENT THAT MADE IS. THE LIKE TRYING VERIFICATION SEEM LIKE IT'S A MORE ACTORS FIVE NOT QUITE THE RIGHT WORD BUT PEOPLE ARE BETTER ABLE TO DOCTOR AND TONIGHT ON OF THAT SO CAUSES ANY SMALL ADJUSTMENT IN. THE HOURS IN THE CASE BECAUSE OF YOUR BETTER ABLE TO THAT SOMETHING'S MAKE OUT SO I DON'T KNOW IN TERMS OF THE PAPER PROCESS REALLY TRONIC PROCESS WITH YOU SEEN ANY SALACIOUS IN. RULES DOCUMENT. HABITS AND THE AND THE LEVEL DOCUMENT. DEBTS THAT'S A THAT'S IT SO BECAUSE NEW THE ERROR A SEEMS LIKE A DROPPED WHEN USED ELECTRONIC. ARM I THINK THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S IMPACTED NECESSARILY THAT HOURS OKAY I THINK THAT IT HAS- SUPPORTED PEOPLE IN BEING ABLE TO. TRACK TRACK IN AND ARE THERE TIME AND BE AWARE IF THEY'VE MADE AN ERROR ON AND SO THAT'S BEEN A POSITIVE THING. ALRIGHT AND LOW QUESTION ACTUALLY FOR FINANCE SO I MEAN PLEASE OF COURSE WE PASS A BUDGET EACH YEAR FOR THE NEXT YEAR BUT WE ALSO IN A BUDGETS QUESTIONS TALK ABOUT OUT YEARS RIGHT WHAT NOW WHAT AND SO WE LOOK AT- THE OUT YEARS- SO IN TERMS OF THE OUT YEAR NUMBERS FOR- FOR AYE HSS AND OTHER THINGS RELATED TO SERVICES FOR SENIORS ARE WE- RATING IN THE- INCREASING DEMOCRATS. CHANGES REALIZING THAT MAYBE SOME POLICY CHANGES IN THE FUTURE BUT STILL YOU KNOW WE'RE- SO I MEAN WHAT'S THE PROJECTED GROSS OF AYE TO ASSESS YEAR BY YEAR OVER INTO THE OUT YEARS. SO WE DO NOT SPECIFICALLY- YOU KNOW FACTOR IN DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES. BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT- YOU KNOW THIS PROGRAM KIND OF TRACKS WITH WITH MEDI CAL ESSENTIALLY SO- AS YOU KNOW. BECAUSE BECAUSE GENERALLY THE WAY INTO I JUST **** THROUGH THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM. SO WHAT WE GENERALLY DO IS WE LOOK AT THE TRANS- THE DEPARTMENT LOOKS AT THE TRENDS AND HOW HOW CASE. HAS INCREASINGLY WHAT. PROJECTED GO YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE BRIDGE BAY ON. CHANGES BUT GENERALLY NO WE DO NOT- YOU KNOW FACTOR IN DEMOGRAPHICS- IT'S HARD TO PREDICT- YOU KNOW WHO. IS GOING TO BE USING I HSS IT- WE KNOW THAT WITH THE AGING POPULATION THERE WILL YOU KNOW THERE ARE GOING TO BE- PROBABLY MORE- PEOPLE ARE ELIGIBLE. BUT AS MISS THOMPSON WAS SAYING WE ALSO HAVE- YOU KNOW THIS POPULATION ARE HIGHER- POPULATION OF. ON THE BILL AT THE SITE COMING INTO THIS PROGRAM SO YOUNGER- POPULATION WITH HIRE ME. THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN GROWING PRETTY STEADILY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- I THINK- IT THAT TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AS WE MOVE FORWARD OKAY SO I GUESS THIS IS THE IS A MORE CONCRETE QUESTION IS THAT AS WERE LOOKING AT OUT YEARS WHAT IS THE PROJECTED GROSS THAT YOU'RE USING THAT FINANCES USING AND MAYBE LA- CAN ALSO ANSWER WHETHER LA IS LOOKING AT IS WE'RE JUST YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE BUDGET IS ABOUT NEXT YEAR BUT THEN YOU SAY WELL LOOK AT YOUR- IMPACTS SO. WHAT THREE. USING FOR PROJECTIONS FOR THE I GUESS THAT WE GOT LIKE FIVE YEARS I THINK. FIVE YEAR ELLIS THOUGH YEARS TWO THREE OBVIOUSLY I CAN CHANGE WITH NEW INFORMATION THAT'S- EVEN DO MAY REVIE FOR THE SAME YEAR BUT I MEAN WHAT. WHAT GROWTH ARE WE PLANNING FOR AND I'D JUST US- AS WE'RE GOING AS WE- TALK ABOUT THESE OUT YOUR PROJECTIONS. TO WE ARE WE ARE PROJECTING SIGNIFICANT GROWTH I APOLOGIZE YOU DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION IN FRONT OF ME BUT WE CAN DEFINITELY GET BACK TO YOU- GENERALLY THIS PROGRAM COST WISE- SINCE. YOU KNOW THAT. I WOULD SAY PROBABLY OVER THE LAST- TEN YEARS IS PROBABLY ON- THAT TOTAL EXPENDITURES HAVE BEEN GROWING AROUND LIKE A 10211% CLIP ANNUALLY- AGAIN WE WILL YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO LOOK AT CERTAIN POLICY CHANGES SO THE RECENT- CHANGE IN THE COUNTY I. SYSTEM A WE- ARMENIANS ABOUT LEVEL THAT IS GOING TO THAT FACTORS IN TO OUR GROWTH FACTOR. UP TO OUR- THE INCREASED COST TO THE STATE. IT'S YOU KNOW AGAIN A LOT OF IT IS ALSO BASED OFF THE GROWTH IN THE SLOPE THAT WE SEE AND I THINK WERE SOMEWHERE IN THE- 5% ANNUALLY- IS WHAT THE CASELOAD HAS BEEN GROWING BY. US ALL THOSE FACTORS GO INTO IT- I CAN'T I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS HERE I DON'T KNOW IF MY COLLEAGUE LA- DOES BUT WE CAN WE CAN DEFINITELY GET BACK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT WERE. WHAT WE THINK THE GROWTH RATE IS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS IN TERMS OF EXPENDITURES OKAY SO I THINK- THAT IS ALWAYS HOPEFUL BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE DO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WELL WE CAN'T YOU KNOW WE'RE- NO ONE TIMERS IS ON GOING WHAT'S- HOW MUCH DO WE HAVE ON GOING IT CETERA AND- I'D- NOTE. GIVEN THE PREVIOUS WORK OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE SAYING THAT WE NEED TO INCORPORATE THE DEMOGRAPHICS THE REALIZE DEMOCRATS IS ONLY ONE FACTOR OF MANY AND HOW MUCH WOULD ACTUALLY SPEND- BUT I THINK IT IS SOMETHING THAT. WE WANT TO BE YEAH. WELL IT'S ACTORS WHICH- PROJECTIONS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GO- IT DAILY AT THE ONE A COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL. AS PART OF OUR ALSO FISCAL FORECAST THAT WE DO NOVEMBER AND THEN ALSO IN MAY- WE ALSO LOOK AT TO PROGRAM GROWTH I THINK SPECIFICALLY WHAT YOU'RE MENTIONING IS IT'S NOT JUST CASELOAD IT'S THE POLICY IMPACTS AND ACCOUNTING FOR THOSE AND WHEN WE DO LOOK AT THOSE IN THE OUT YEARS WE TRIED TO ACCOUNT TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE- THE SIZE OF THE POOL OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THOSE POLICIES TO THAN COSTA IN THE FUTURE BUT THAT QUESTION THAT YOU RAISE OF EXPLICITLY FACTORING AGAIN CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS WITHIN THAT SHORT OUT YOUR WINDOW. IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT AS WELL AND IMPROVE THAT WE CULD ON OUR FISCAL FOR- I DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE ESTIMATE IN THE OUT YEARS BUT I JUST KNOW IN THE BOOK IN THE WINTERS BUDGET THE THAT THEY'RE ESTIMATING AND THE GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS SIXTEEN PER SAID THE EXTENT CARRY FOR DOUBT YOU ZERO SAN MAGNET THAT WERE TO UP BUT AGAIN THAT SICK PERCENT CAPTURE RECENT POLICY DECISION THAT HAVE IN SOME CASES TO SHIP. OR CALL TO THE GENERAL FUND. ALL RIGHT. APPRECIATE THAT AND- I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WHAT MY THINGS WE WANT TO BE SURE'S SAYS WERE TALKING AND I MEAN THIS. SERVICES FOR THE- FOR PEOPLE DISABILITIES AND WHO ARE AGING AND NEED- THE SERVICES ARE NO WE WANNA BE SURE WERE PREPARED FOR THAT I WOULD ALSO WANT TO MAKE NOTES- BECAUSE AS YOU GIVE US ARE TALKING ABOUT YEAH WHAT WE'RE PROJECTING AND THE INCREASES THAT THIS IS BEING DRIVEN PARTLY BY AGAIN AN AGING POPULATION- WE WANT TO HELP TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE DISABILITIES SO THEY CAN THE FULL LIVES I MEAN THAT'S PART OF OUR COMMITMENT SO WE HAVE AN INCREASE DOWN THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE- PEOPLE WHO WE CAN TAKE CARE OF FULLER LIVING WHO. WHO WRITES FOR FOUR EIGHT ANOTHER THING AND THEN THE OTHER THING I DO ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE ABOUT TO ASSESS THAT I JUST A STILL A ALTERNATIVES TO INSTITUTIONALIZATION SO AS WE'RE LOOKING GOING LOOK AT THE NUMBER. ISN'T THIS AND THAT'S- THE CHALLENGE. WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE ALTERNATE. TO NOT DOING IS EITHER SPENDING EVEN MORE THROUGH INSTITUTIONALIZATION OR NOT PROVIDING SERVICES AND- THE CONSEQUENCES THOSE HAVE SO I JUST WANNA BE SURE WE FRAME IN THAT REGARD IT'S NOT THAT- WELL WE A LOOK OUT FAST IS GOING AND- WE JUST NOT SPEND MONEY ON THAT- SO I HOPE THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT MANY OF THE ALTERNATIVES AND FOR ACTUALLY COSTS EVEN MORE. IS AND IS PART OF THE FUNCTION OF THE FACT THAT DEALER STATE IS GETTING OLDER AND- WE HAVE PEOPLE HO NEED SUPPORT TO HELP- SO I DID WHAT I RECOGNIZE THAT AND- SO WE CAN GET BETTER DIAZ GET BACK TO THAT- JUST- AGAIN BECAUSE I KNOW THE DISCUSSIONS WILL BACK ABOUT. WHAT ARE. HOW YOU'RE SPENDING IS GOING TO BE ABLE TALK ABOUT THIS YEAR'S BUDGET SO JUST. KNOWING FOR WE ARE ON THIS PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. OKAY RIGHT. OKAY SO I GUESS MAY REVISE WILL GET SOME UPDATED NUMBERS THAT ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT OKAY SO ISSUE NUMBER TWOS THE UPDATE ON THE AYE TO ASSESS MOE. IN ITS OF EFFORTS AND IF YOU CAN PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF FIRST FOR THE RECORD. TESTING AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT- SO HE'S GOT PRESENT ON THIS ISSUE. RIGHT. OKAY SO IN NINETEEN TWENTY THE I JUST US I'M A E. WAS REPLACED- AHEAD AFTER DOING SOME ANALYSIS AS A PART OF THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN- AND OF THE COORDINATED CARE INITIATIVE AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT OF THAT EMILY THERE WAS THIS ODD PART OF THAT WAS TO DO LOOK AT THAT FUNDING STRUCTURE AND SOME ANALYSIS AS TO- HOW IT WILL BE OUR BEST TO GO FORWARD AND AS A PART OF THAT THE M. THREE BASED IT WAS PRODUCED BY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THE INSTITUTE STATEWIDE. AND BE ON ANY WALL INFLATOR TO THAT- AND HE WAS REDUCED FROM 7% 24% ALSO THE APPROACH TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING WAS ALTERED- AND IT IS AN ALLOCATION- THE NON FEDERAL SHARE OF THAT ALLOCATION IS A COUNTIES CHOOSE TO EXPAND MORE THAN THAT THE NOT BECOME I COUNTY. CALL OF THOSE WERE THE BIG THINGS THAT HAPPEN AS A PART OF THE NINE TO MOE IT ALSO DID CONTINUE THE- ELEMENTS AROUND I HAD LOCAL NEGOTIATIONS AS FAR AS THE WAGE SUPPLEMENT WHERE COUNTIES COULD NEGOTIATE A SUPPLEMENT TO A WAGE THAT THE- SHARED IN ONE TIME AND THEN HAN AN ON GOING BENEFITS TO IT- SITTING ON TOP OF ANY MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE IT ALSO CONTINUED AT THE OPTION TO NEGOTIATE AT. INCREASE ABOVE WHAT THE STATE PARTICIPATION CAP WAS AND THE STATE WOULD SHARE IN UP 210% OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD OF THOSE INCREASES SO THAT WAS ALSO CONTINUED AS A PART OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY MOE WE WORKED CLOSELY WITH C. SACK AND SEE TO BE THE A AND CAPITA AS A PART OF. THAT ON THE AND EASY WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED AMONGST THE COUNTIES AND- SO THAT WORK WAS COMPLETED AND THAT- THOSE ALLOCATIONS WERE DETERMINED. THOSE ARE. KIND OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF WHERE WE'RE AT WITH WITH THE EMILY. I THANK YOU. NO COMMENT ON THAT FROM SEIZE ACT YEAH I THINK FOR THE GREATER VIEW THE MAJOR PROVISIONS OF THE NEW EMILY AGAIN JUSTIN GARRETT WITH C. SACK- TO START OFF WITH COUNTIES ONE EXPRESS OUR CONTINUING GRATITUDE TO THE LEGISLATION THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THIS NEW EMILY THAT PROVIDES A MORE SUSTAINABLE FISCAL STRUCTURE FOR COUNTIES TO MENINGITIS COST. COMES ARE PROUD TO ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM ON BEHALF OF BEHALF OF THE STATE ON TOP OF ONE OF OUR RESIDENTS REMAIN SAFELY IN THEIR HOME AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATIVE. PARTNERSHIP WITH DEPARTMENT SO SERVICES AND DEPARTMENT FINANCES WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED A LOT IN THE FIRST EIGHT MONTHS OF THE NEW FAMILY IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION. ALSO SOME OF THOSE- MAJOR SIGNIFICAN ACTIONS WE'VE TAKEN- WE CONVENED ACCOUNT GROUP TO DETERMINE THE INDIVIDUAL AMOUNTS OF THE NEW EMILY OVER CLOSELY WITH CSS ON THE FISCAL AND PROGRAMMATIC AGAINST THOSE OUT COUNTIES. WE HOSTED- AND LEAD AT ALL DAY AT TWO HUNDRED PERSON COUNTY STAFF TRAINING TO ENSURE IT IS ACCURATE ON JUST IN ON THE- IT'S GOING BACK TO THE PROVISION AND WE MAINTAIN. CONSIDER OPEN COMMUNICATE AT THE STATE LEVEL WITH PROVIDING UNIONS TO ENSURE CONTINUED PROGRESS ON. THE MARKET. ON THE ISSUE OF I SAYS CALL BARGAINING. AND LEGISLATURE MAY IT CLEAR LAST YEAR VERY IN. IN SO THEM I DO AGREEMENTS BE REACHED AND MORE PROGRESS ON THIS AND I'M- TO. THAT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. WE HAVE FOURTEEN NEW AGREEMENT SINCE JULY FIRST- WHICH IS FAR ABOVE THE HISTORIC PACE OF NEW AGREEMENTS. WITH COUNTY SUPERVISORS VERY DEDICATED THIS PROGRAM. ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO LOCAL LEVEL TO ENSURE- THESE WAGE INCREASES GET ADOPTED- THESE- FOURTEEN COUNTIES REPRESENT COUNTY THAT HAD BEEN WITHOUT- AGREEMENT. AND FOR AN AVERAGE OF FORTY SEVEN MONTHS SO A NUMBER OF YEARS. ON THE NOW HAVE AN AGREEMENT THAT'S POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE IT SIGNIFICAN IN FUSION OF STATE AND ALL FUND. FOR THIS PROGRAM THAT MAKES IT MORE SUSTAINABLE FOR COUNTIES URBAN. RURAL SUBURBAN COUNTIES FRESNO SAN BERNARDINO RIVERSIDE. MARIPOSA SANTA BARBARA SO NUMBER OF- COUNTIES HAVE REACHED AGREEMENTS- IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT COUNTIES ARE INVESTING IN THIS PROGRAM FOR WEIGHT INCREASES FOR. INCREASES THAT ARE GOING TO AFFECT THIS YEAR IT'S MORE THAN. FORTY MILLION DOLLARS ON AN COUNTY FUNDS. THAT IS ON TOP OF THE MORE THAN SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS A COUNTIES INVESTED LAST YEAR. AND WE SAW FOUR MONTHS LAST FOUR NEW AGREEMENTS CAN BE REACHED SO WE HELP FOR SOME ADDITIONAL PROGRESS. LOOKING AT STATEWIDE- TO LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF AYE ACCESS PROVIDERS AND HOW MANY. PROVIDERS WORK IN A COUNTY THAT HAS A KERN AGREEMENT IT'S NEARLY NINE TEN PROVIDERS SO A FULL 80% SO WE'RE REALLY SICK PLEASE. I JUST. AS THE FINE THING I'LL TOUCH ON ON THE BARGAIN IS. ONE OF THE OTHER NEW PROVISIONS LAST YEAR WITH THIS. POTENTIAL. THE RELEASE STATES IT PASSED LEADERS IT WOULD ONLY OCCUR. IF FORCED. AND FOR ME SELECT. WOULD HAVE TO HAVE NEXT AGREEMENT. THERE HAVE TO GO THROUGH MEDIATION FACT FINDING WITH PROVIDING UNION. THE FACT FINDER WOULD NEED TO ISSUE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE MORE FAVORABLE TO THE UNION. AND IT STILL BE A NINETY DAY PERIOD TO REACH- A NEW AGREEMENTS ON MAKE THREE POINTS ABOUT THIS FIRST- NO COUNTY TO HADN'T ALREADY-GONE TO FACT FINDING HAS YET UTILIZE THIS PROCESS- AND SO. YOU KNOW THERE ARE A COUPLE COUNTIES IT MAY BE GETTING CLOSE- BUT THEY'RE ONLY AT STEP ONE OF FOUR OF THESE PROCESSES YOU KNOW THEY ONLY HAVE. EXPIRED AGREEMENT THE HAVING A GUN TO FAX SIGN IN AND THE OTHER THING SO IS STILL THREE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO REACH AN AGREEMENT. TO IF I COUNTY IN A PROUD UNION GO TO THIS PROCESS RELATED TO THE 1% REALIGN WITHHOLDING. IT DOES NOT MEAN THE COUNTIES BARGAINING IN BAD FAITH THAT MEANS THEY'RE ACTIVELY BARGAINING IN GOOD FAITH. AND THEY JUST CAN'T EACH AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE OFFER FROM THE COUNTY AND THE OFFER FROM THE UNION. AND THEN FINALLY I WOULD JUST SAY WE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED TO THE STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL THAT WOULD INCREASE THIS- PENALTY AMOUNT FROM 1% TO SEVEN PERCENT. WE ALL CAME TOGETHER LAST YEAR SAT ACROSS THE TABLE REACHED AGREEMENT ON THIS NEW PROCESS WITH MINISTRATION OF LET'S. IN PROVIDE MEANS IN SERENA. NOW BE YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY RENEGOTIATE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION. SO WE WOULD BE OPPOSED TO THAT THAT I KNOW WILL BE HEARD AND IN A- FEW PANEL SO NOW SO JUST WANNA WRAP UP BY. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE BEST. A GENERAL FUND. COUNTY FOR. A FOR WORKING HARD IMPLEMENTS AND ACHIEVE NEW COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS THANK YOU. THEY COME IN. LA IN A- AS MY IN THE NEAR PACKAGE. DUE TO THE CHANGES THAT WE MADE IN NINETEEN TWENTY OVER TIME THE GENERAL FUND WILL TAKE ON- A LARGER SHARE OF TOTAL COSTS BUT WE WOULD NOTE THAT THAT IS BY DESIGN- THOSE CHANGES WERE LARGELY DUE TO FINDINGS THAT THE- COUNTY COST PRIOR TO NINETEEN TWENTY DID NOT ALIGNED WITH THE AVAILABLE REVENUES COUNTIES HAD TO NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE REALIGNMENT TO COVER THOSE COSTS SO BY REPLACING COUNTY HOSPITAL OR AMOUNTS TO THAN REFLECT THE ACTUAL REVENUES THAT THEY HAD THAT IN AND OF ITSELF RESULTED IN THOSE COSTS BEING SHIPPED TO THE GENERAL FUND- SO JUST INSURING THAT- OVER TIME. THE COST OF DOING THAT IS CAPTURED AND FUTURE BUT IT'S- THANK YOU FINANCE NOTHING FURTHER ASKED FANS OKAY. ALL RIGHT QUESTIONS OKAY I GUESS WITH YOURSELF- APPRECIATE THE- THE PRESENTATION SO AND SO IN TERMS OF THE EAT SO YOU MENTIONED THAT A LOT OF THE- COUNTIES HAVE COME TO AGREEMENTS AT A FASTER RATE HOW MANY COUNTIES STILL DO NOT HAVE AGREEMENTS- AT THIS POINT. SO WE'RE CURRENTLY AT A THIRTY FOUR COUNTIES AND HAVE A CURRENT EMILY YOUR TENTATIVE AGREEMENTS- WE HAVE FOURTEEN TO FIFTEEN COUNTIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING- OTHER ARMENIAN SMALL AMOUNT OF COUNTY IS- THERE'S A COUPLE THAT ARE IMPASSES A COUPLE THAT ARE WAITING TO HEAR FROM THE UNION TO INITIATE BARGAINING- SO THAT YOU KNOW REPRESENTS THE BUT AGAIN IT'S IF YOU LOOK AT THE TERMS OF NUMBER PROVIDERS WERE CLOSE TO EIGHTY EIGHT OR OVER EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT. AND WE HAVE A LOT A LOT THAT ARE STILL- CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING AND CERTAINLY HELPFUL THEY'LL REACH AGREEMENT SAM OKAY SO HE SAID THIS FOURTEEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY AGREEMENT RIGHT NOW EXISTING AGREEMENT THERE AND EITHER MID NEGOTIATION OR SOMETHING WITH. THEIR THE TWENTY FOUR IS A THIRTY FOUR HAVE AGREEMENTS TWENTY FOUR DON'T HAVE AGREEMENTS WERE DONE OUT FOURTEEN OF THOSE TWENTY FOUR CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING THE OTHER TEN OR IN SOME OTHER STATUS OF. WAITING TO START BARGAINING OR THE UNIT HAS A REACH OUT AND ISSUE BARGAINING AND A COUPLE ART IMPASSE. OKAY AND DO WE KNOW OF FOR THE ONES WHO DON'T HOW LONG THEY'VE BEEN WITHOUT AGREEMENTS AND A SAID SOMEONE TO GO SHE IN CENTER I MEAN WE HAVE SOME IDEA WHAT THE MEDIA AND OUR-  MEAN IS OF. THE TIME THAT THEY'VE BEEN WITHOUT AGREEMENTS. YEAH I WOULD DEFINITELY ESTIMATE IT'S PROBABLY BEEN- SEVERAL YEARS SOME THAT. YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF JUST EXPIRED IN THE PAST YEAR AT NO CINEMA STANISLAUS. MARINE AS A LIVING WAGE JORDAN SO THAT ACTIVELY DOING WAGE INCREASES BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A CURRENT AGREEMENTS. AND THEN THERE CERTAINLY ARE SOME THAT WOULD BE IN THE SITUATION OF THE- THE NEW AGREEMENT SUGGESTS BEEN REACH WHERE THEY HAD BEEN WITH AN EXPIRED AGREEMENT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS- YEAH. I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT AVERAGE AMOUNT THEM. OKAY SO I MEAN I THINK THAT'S THE CONCERN I REALIZE THAT WE- WE CREATE THIS PROCESS AT CENTER OF BUT THAT WE STOP COUNTIES THAT- STILL HAVE NOT. THAT NEED STILL HAVEN'T HAD AGREEMENT IN YEARS AND- DOCTOR NOT CLOSE TO GETTING ONE THAT'S- THAT'S PROBLEMATIC. YEAH I KNOW CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN THERE WE'RE- DEFINITELY INTERESTED IN SEEING THAT CONTINUE GRAHAM IT'S I KNOW AT THE STATE LEVEL. YOU KNOW WE REACH OUT TO INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES WHEN THE UNIONS HAVE HAVE COME TO US WITH SPECIFIC CONCERNS THEY HAVE ABOUT THIS YOU CAN GET INVOLVED IN BARGAINING. BUT WE MAKE SURE IT'S ACCURATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE TOOLS AND THE PPORTUNITIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. AND YOU KNOW. IT'S AND CERTAIN SITUATIONS BARGAINING TAKES TIME SEEN FOURTEEN NEW AGREEMENTS IN JULY FORCES. ARE DIVERSE IS GREAT PROGRESS. HAVING US STILL A NUMBER OF COUNTIES CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING- WORKING TOWARDS A NEW AGREEMENT- WHEN WE HOPE TO SEE MORE SOON. RIGHT WELL APPRECIATE THE PROGRESS BUT I ALSO CAN UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION THE WORKERS WHO MAY HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR YEARS WITHOUT AGREEMENTS AND STILL NOT HAVING THEM. SO THAT'S I MEAN THAT'S- THAT'S THE THING WE WERE TRYING TO BE SURE WE- AT. THAT'S NOT FAIR. CELL YEAH. OKAY AND THEN. I THINK IN TERMS OF JUST SORT OF LOOKING AT SO IF WE TALKED ABOUT ISIS. TRY PROJECT YOU KNOW- CASELOAD DEMOGRAPHICS BUT ALSO WITH THE WITH THIS- WITH THE MOE CHANGES. CERTAINLY I WANT. RE QUESTION ABOUT THAT BUT- AGAIN. WE CAN GET A BETTER. IDEA ABOUT HOW WE'RE PROJECTING OUT INTO THE OUT YEARS- WITH ALL THE MULTIPLE CHANGES AN EXACT AND IT'S BY ALSO HELPFUL IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO SAY. BYE OKAY WE EXPECT WE HAVE THE CHANGE PLUS WORD OF THIS MUCH BECAUSE OF CASELOADS ARE AGING. DEMOGRAPHICS THAN WE EXPECT THIS IS GONE. THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THE AMMO YELLED AT THE EITHER PLUS OR MINUS DEPENDING. ON THE STATE BUDGET. AS WERE LOOKING OUT HERE SO WE CAN. SEE OBVIOUSLY IS. YEARS GO ON WITH AND- KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL NUMBERS ARE BUT START. DOING SOME OF THIS MODELING PROJECTIONS OUT THERE SO WE- AND- HAVE A BETTER IDEA. THE FOR GOING. OKAY ALL RIGHT OKAY I THINK TO A SO RIGHT WELL THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR- FROM SOME DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES INTO THANK YOU ALL RIGHT- ISSUE NUMBER THREE IS A MANDATORY I JUST A SOCIAL WORKER TRAINING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. PLEASE SO- I TOUCHED ON EARLIER ONE OF THE- CORE THINGS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON IS ENSURING THAT OUR ASSESSMENTS ARE. DONE ACCURATELY AND CONSISTENTLY AND THAT'S ON ON GOING- WORK THAT WE DO AND- IT THAT THE FRAMEWORK AND THE STRUCTURE THAT REGULATORY GUIDELINES THAT ARE IN PLACE ARE- AT THAT ALL OF OUR SOCIAL WORKERS ARE TRAINED AND EDUCATED ON THOSE AND THAT THEY'RE BEING USED CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE BOARD. SO THIS PROPOSAL ACTUALLY DOES TWO THINGS IT- IT DOES A ONE DAY REFRESHER FOR ALL CURRENT SOCIAL WORKERS SUPERVISORS AND PROGRAM MANAGERS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE TOOLS ARE UNDERSTOOD IT APPROPRIATELY BEING UTILIZED AND IT ALSO MANDATES THE SOCIAL WORKER TRAINING FOR ANY NEW SOCIAL WORKERS. SO WE'VE HAD THE TRAINING ACADEMY IN PLACE FOR QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW BUT IT HAS BEEN AN OPTION- AT. MOST COUNTIES DO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT OPTION BUT WE DO FEEL THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ALL SOCIAL WORKERS HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO.

I MEAN I AGES US FROM HER PROVIDER FROM BUTTE COUNTY. I CARE FOR MY BROTHER TEAL HE'S A THIRTY ONE YEAR OLD QUADRIPLEGIC WHO SUFFERS FROM CEREBRAL PALSY- MY MOTHER AND I PROVIDE YEAR. ROUND AROUND THE CLOCK BECAUSE FOR CARE FOR HIM- WITHOUT. MY MOTHER AND I CARING FOR HIM HE WOULD BE AN ANSWER TO SENT THE LEVEL OF CARE HE IS OUT. WHICH WOULD BE- GREATLY DIMINISHED LEVEL OF CARE FOR HIS CALL IN QUALITY OF LIFE FIVE. FOR MORE WE CAN PROVIDE. MANY INSTITUTIONS- THAT CARE FOR- DISABLED FOLKS IN MY BROTHER'S LEVEL OF KERR- IF PROVIDE MUCH SHOT HIGHER MEDICATION DOSAGE AS- IN. SOMETIMES I NECESSARY MEDICATIONS AND ABLE TO US TODAY MAKE THE MARS DOMICILE- WE'VE- SEEN MULTIPLE INVESTIGATIONS BY. THE NEW YORK TIMES THE WASHINGTON POST THAT BACK THAT UP. THAT THAT OVER MEDICATION. ESPECIALLY WITH THREE WILL POLICY DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS. HI I KNOW THAT INSTRUCTION CARE IS NECESSARY IN SOME SITUATIONS BUT MY FAMILY WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE THAT- FOR MY BROTHER'S CASE- BEING CARED FOR AT HOME ALLOWS MY BROTHER TO LIVE IN COMFORT AND DIGNITY HE HAS THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMMUNITY WE CAN TKE A MILE. TO A PUBLIC EVENTS WE'VE I MEAN IF HE LOVES TO GET OUT AND ABOUT. FIVE WE BELIEVE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING THE BEST LIFE POSSIBLE FOR MY BROTHER. AND THAT'S WHY THESE THINGS NOT EVERY FAMILY IS IN THAT SAME SITUATION THAT WE ARE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT CARE OURSELVES- BUT BECAUSE I TRUST PAYS SOLO- FAMILY MEMBERS ARE OFTEN THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT CARE IN BUTTE COUNTY WHERE I LIVE. THERE WERE OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND HOURS OF I. H. SASS. BY THAT WERE AUTHORIZED BY THE COUNTY BUT WERE NOT USED IN THE PAST YEAR- NOT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T USE NEED THESE HOURS. BUT BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T FIND. PEOPLE TO WORK. I AT THAT. WAGE I AM NOT EVERY. PERSON AS I MENTIONED HAS SOMEONE IMMEDIATELY THERE THAT CAN PROVIDE THAT CARE FOR THEM. I WHAT I'M ASKING IS THAT- WHAT HAPPENED IF ANYONE ELSE'S YOU HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT MAY NEED CARE AT SOME POINT WHAT WOULD YOU WANT FOR YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS- HOW MANY SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. I HAVE SUFFERED- ADVERSE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OR LIVED IN UNSAFE AND UNSANITARY CONDITIONS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ONE TO COVER THOSE HOURS- WE NEED TO INCREASE PRESSURE ON COUNTIES WERE DELINQUENT IN CLOSING THE RIGHT SUCH CONTRACTS. INCREASING PENALTIES FOR INACTION. HI AND THEN THEY IS AFTER YOU TAKE KERR- BUDGE ACTIONS ARE REQUESTING TO INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES TO ACT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF ITIS US CLIENTS PROVIDERS BY INCREASING WAGE THAT WE CAN KEEP PROVIDING THIS MYSTERY WORK. SO WITH THAT ALTERNATE I ACTUALLY HAVE A. THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN- MY NAME IS CHRISTINE ABBAS HAMILTON I'M HERE REPRESENTING YOU W. THE UNITED DOMESTIC WORKERS APPS ME- WE REPRESENT A HUNDRED SIXTEEN. THOUSAND I JUST AS WORKERS IN TWENTY ONE COUNTIES. AND I WISH THAT I COULD SAY THAT. THE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ISSUES THAT ARE BRAND NEW BUT SADLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE- SITUATION WITH WAGES WE'RE WE'RE LIKE GROUNDHOG DAY AND I'M JUST TIRED OF THIS GROUNDHOG DAY AND I WISH IT WOULD. IT WOULD START A NEW DAY- SO. YES THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS SINCE JULY. ARE WE WHERE WE NEED TO BE I WOULD SAY THAT'S NO- WHAT WE HANDED OUT ARE HANDING OUT RIGHT NOW IS COPIES OF. ON THE STATUS OF OUR CONTRACTS THROUGH ITS UPDATED AS OF MARCH FIFTH. SO YOU CAN SEE THAT COUNTIES IN YELLOW WE HAVE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE THAT REMAIN OUTSTANDING- VIEW COUNTY WHERE JUSTIN IS FROM GOES SPECIFICALLY BACK TO TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN SO WE'RE LOOKING AT GOING ON SIX YEARS THERE- SOME OF THESE ARE JUST REALLY. DIFFICULT SITUATIONS THAT I DON'T SEE RESOLUTION HAPPENING ANYTIME SOON THE OTHER POINT THAT I WANT TO RAISE IS EVEN IF WE HAVE REACHED AGREEMENTS IN IN SOME OF THESE OTHER PLACES. WE'RE LOOKING AT AGREEMENTS THAT ARE FOR FIFTY CENTS ABOVE THE MINIMUM WAGE. AND THAT'S- PURELY BECAUSE THAT IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. AND I WANT TO NOTE THAT ONLY 10% OF THE WORKERS THAT WE REPRESENT GET HEALTH BENEFITS THROUGH THEIR CONTRACT MEANING THAT THE VAST MAJORITY LIKELY OR ON MEDI CAL. AND SO THESE ARE THE WORKING POOR THESE ARE THE POPULATIONS THAT WORK FULL TIME AND ARE STILL ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS SO IN LIGHT OF THAT. AND IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS A CRISIS IN TERMS OF WORK FORCE RECRUITING AND RETAINING IN AYE HSS THAT I BELIEVE ANY CLIENT COULD SPEAK TO. IT BUT A SPECIFICALLY CLIENTS WHO DON'T HAVE FAMILY PROVIDERS WE WANT TO SEE THE PENALTY AMOUNT INCREASE FOR COUNTIES THAT ARE. NOT NEGOTIATING IN GOOD FAITH SO AS WE TALKED. HOLDING THAT WAS IT- PASSED LAST YEAR WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT BECOME A 7% WITHHOLDING AND HAVE IT BE ANNUAL MEANING THAT SO LONG AS IT REMAINS OUTSTANDING EVERY YEAR THEY WOULD FACE ANOTHER WITHHOLDING WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. TRANSPARENCY IN TERMS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS- FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE COUNTIES THAT HAVE BEEN BARGAINING AS I MENTIONED IF YOU COUNTY FOR GOING ON SIX YEARS. THAT RETAIN A LAW FIRMS THAT ARE NEGOTIATING ON THEIR BEHALF- I CAN'T IMAGINE IN SIX YEARS HOW MUCH OF THOSE RETAINERS ADD UP TO. AND HOW MUCH DOES THAT COME RELATIVE TO WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING TO GET FOR FOLKS. AND IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT WE HAVE FILED NUMEROUS PUBLIC INFORMATION REQUESTS- WHAT WE GET IS PIECES OF INFORMATION OR JUST BROAD- LINE ITEM EXPENDITURES IT'S HARD TO PARCEL EXACTLY HOW MUCH IS BEING SPENT ON AYE HSS NEGOTIATIONS SPECIFICALLY. WE THINK THAT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THIS PHENOMENON. OF RETAINING THESE OUTSIDE VENDORS AND THAT WE HAVE. YOU KNOW HONESTLY AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO NEVER NEGOTIATE BECAUSE THEY'LL JUST KEEP COLLECTING THEIR RETAINERS AS LONG AS THIS KEEPS GOING. WE NEED TO HAVE TRANSPARENCY HOW MUCH IS BEING SPENT. AND WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE IN RELATION TO WHAT THE ACTUAL COST WOULD BE TO JUST SETTLE THE CONTRACT. SO THERE'S A PERVERSE INCENTIVE THERE- WE'D LIKE TO SEE A AN ACTION REVERSE THAT AS TAKEN LAST YEAR WHICH IS THAT ONCE THE MINIMUM WAGE IT'S FIFTEEN DOLLARS. THE COST RATIOS SO THE SHARE OF COSTS WILL FLIP. WE'RE THE COUNTIES WILL NOW PICK UP AND THE STATE WOULD PICK UP THIRTY FIVE. SO THAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT EXISTS NOW. THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY ON THAT IS IF WE THINK IT'S HARD NOW. IT'LL BE A HUNDRED TIMES HARDER WHEN THIS POLICY IS ENACTED ANYTHING THAT WOULD INCREASE COSTS ON THE COUNTY AND WOULD ONLY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO GET CONTRACTS. AND THEN THAT'S ALSO HOLDING TRUE ON THE XCELERATED CASE LOW GROWTH ALLOCATIONS THAT'S JUST A REALLY FANCY WORD FOR WE NEED TO GET THE MONEY FASTER. BECAUSE THAT'S ANOTHER MAJOR PROBLEM THAT ALWAYS COMES UP IN NEGOTIATION SO I'LL WRAP UP WITH THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS FROM- THE PARCEL SERVICES TO THESE PROPOSALS OKAY. RIGHT HELLO THE ON FINANCE ALL RIGHT. SO IN TERMS OF THE- SO WE HAD TO THE COUNTIES ARGUING WILL WE GET AN AGREEMENT LAST YEAR RIGHT AND THERE ARE PROVISIONS PUT IN TO TRY TO MOVE PEOPLE TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS BECAUSE RECOGNIZE THAT WAS A PROBLEM LAST YEAR. BASED ON. WHAT YOU'RE PRESENTING NOW CAN YOU MAYBE SPEECH TO THE EITHER AFFECTED THIS OR AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROVISIONS WE DID SO THEIR ARGUMENT IS THAT WELL LOOK ON THE MIDDLE OF THIS RIGHT AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE MORE CONTRACTS WE READ BEFORE BUT YOU KNOW AS YOU POINTED OUT THERE STILL LIVES SOMEWHERE IN TAX RATE. SO HOW CAN YOU CAN YOU. TALK ABOUT WELL. SO WHY SHOULDN'T WE GIVE THIS A CHANCE RIGHT. GIVE A LITTLE LONGER- IT'S HOW DO YOU SEE THAT THE CURRENT NECK AND WHAT WE GREW TO LAST YEAR IS SOMETHING THAT'S- HEADED TOWARD FAILURE ARE AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SAYING OR IS THAT SOME. SOMETHING LIKE DO YOU TO SPEAK TO WHO- WHY THE TOOLS ARE INSUFFICIENT. TO TRY TO GET CONTRACTS AND REMAINING COUNTIES- THAT WE WERE THAT WE TRIED PUTTING IN PLACE LAST YEAR. I WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE IN ADDITION TO THE WITHHOLDING THAT'S GOING ON THAT'S RESULTING IN CONTRACTS GETTING- FINALIZED I MEAN WE'VE HAD PUBLIC ACTIONS I MEAN THERE'S BEEN ARRESTS THERE'S BEEN CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. A PRESS YOU KNOW CONTACTING LEGISLATORS TO INTERVENE AND THE I MEAN. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT IN AND OF ITSELF YES I WOULD SEE IT ADDED TO IT BUT IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD NEGOTIATORS SAY WELL WE'LL TAKE THE 1% OR YOU COULD TAKE THAT IN THE FORM OF A TEN CENT INCREASE WE'RE GOOD EITHER WAY. THAT TELLS ME THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO ANYBODY RIGHT. HOW MUCH DID IT HELP IT IT IS HELPFUL I'M SURE THAT IT IS I DON'T THINK. THAT WHAT WE HAVE IT SHOULD BE MODELED IN ANY WAY WHICH IS THAT WE GET AGREEMENTS AFTER SHEDDING BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS AND- YOU KNOW LITERALLY GOING ALL OUT IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY SO WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS. YEAH THAT WE MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN THERE IT'S LIKE SAYING YOU KNOW WE LASTED TO THE VERY LAST SECOND AND EIGHTY WE MADE IT. IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY SHOULDN'T BE DRAGGING KICKING AND SCREAMING IT SHOULD BE LET'S DO THIS BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT. AT THE END I KNOW YOU TO BE SPENT MOST OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THESE ARE TOUCHED ON XCELERATED CASE GROWTH ALLOCATION SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT'S- TO- TRY TO GET FASTER PAYMENT CORRECT YES BECAUSE THAT IS A NUMBER ONE COMPLAINT THAT WE RECEIVED FROM COUNTY NEGOTIATORS IS THAT EVEN IF THEY WANT. TO INCREASE THE WAGE THEY CAN'T WAIT FOR THE CASH FROM NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT TO REACH THEM TO COMPENSATE THEM FOR THAT BECAUSE THERE'S AN AVERAGE LACK OF TIME OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS SO THEY DON'T WANT TO FRONT THOSE COSTS. EXCEED FINE IT'S THE OF A COMMENT ON THAT I WOULD JUST LIKE. TO TEARS- THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE PROCESS FOR XCELERATED CASELOAD GROWTH WAS IN PLACE ONLY FOR TWO YEARS- SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. WHEN THERE'S- COORDINATED CARE INITIATIVE WAS ENDED AND WE WENT BACK TO THE OLD- SHARING RATIOS AND WE NEGOTIATE THE NEW AND WE- SO. I WILL WHAT I'M SAYING I GUESS IS THAT. THE ISSUE. THEY RECEIVE THE FILES EIGHTEEN MONTHS LATER THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE PRIOR TO SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. IT WILL BE USED CASE I'LL BE PAYING IN. TWELVE OKAY SIR. BASICALLY GOING TO WHAT WAS BEFORE HER EIGHT. SO ESSENTIALLY THERE HISTORICALLY IT HAS BEEN- VINEGAR ARE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO BARGAIN AND HISTORICALLY ODD WHEN THEY DO BARGAIN THEY KNOW THAT THAT FUNDING IS COMING LATER- WE DON'T SEE THAT AS YOU KNOW A BIG REASON OR A BIG DRIVER OF WHY THE- YOU KNOW WHAT'S- WHAT THE BARRIERS ARE TERRA. TERRA NEGOTIATING BARGAINING OKAY. BUT I WOULD POINT OUT DOCTOR PAN AND I WANT TO SAY FINANCE HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN GETTING US. WITH SPECIFIC COUNTIES THAT HAVE THESE TYPE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW FAST THEY'LL GET THEIR MONEY I WANT TO POINT OUT SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FISCAL PENALTY BUT WE ARE WE HAVE PROPOSED IN THE PAST THINGS LIKE EXHILARATING CASELOAD GROWTH- GETTING ADDITIONAL DOLLARS YOU KNOW OFFSETTING COST LIKE. THE CARROTS HAVE BEEN THERE FOR MANY MOONS AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET TO THE STICKS SO IT'S NOT AS THOUGH LIKE WE'RE JUST GOING FOR THE WORST CASE SCENARIO THIS IS BECAUSE THE CARDS DIDN'T WORK FOR A- PERIOD OF TIME. OKAY ALL RIGHT. HEY ANY OTHER COMMENTS ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU. THE PRESENTATION AND- SO WE ARE PUTTING ITEM THANK YOU DEVELOPMENT CELL OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT.

CREATE SOME SOME PROBLEMS THIS WAS PART OF- AN AGREEMENT LAST YEAR TO PUSH OUT THE DATE- THE ADMINISTRATION BASED ON YOU KNOW- REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND EXPENDITURE PROJECTIONS WE- HAVE PUSH UPDATE FURTHER ANOTHER EIGHTEEN MONTHS SO UNDERSTANDING IT'S STILL. ARE NOT VERY SATISFYING- BUT IT IS- YOU KNOW IT WAS IT WAS A WAY TO- YOU KNOW IT'S A WAY TO KEEP THE BUDGET. IN LINE AS WE GET THROUGH THE FINAL YEAR OF THE MULTI YEAR WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THIS AGAIN AS PART OF THE MAY REVISION- IN TERMS OF UPDATED REVENUES AND EXPENDITURE INFORMATION. OKAY QUESTION COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASSERTIVE. HAVE A QUICK COMMENT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR WHICH IS WITH HIS PERRIN NEEDY BASHES DUSTY MONDIAL OR HE YEAH MY LITTLE WITCHES SO. LAME PROMOTION GET YOUR WHICH IS LESS YES. THE THINKING HER FOR COMING UP AND COMMENTING TODAY. RIGHT SO- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. SO I'M GONNA MAKE A TO THE COMMON ABOUT THIS IN A MAYBE A BROADER COMMENT AND I A NOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING WITH ACTUALLY TO SPEND SOME TIME HERE TODAY TALKING ABOUT OUT YOUR PROJECTIONS AND HOW WE GET ACCURATE ONES. AND SO YOU KNOW I GUESS THE THING I'M THAT THE MASSES SOME FRUSTRATION WITH- SO YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S ACTUALLY SITTING HERE BUT YOU CAN SEND THAT TO YOUR BOSS IS THAT. SO I MEAN I SO I HEAR WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT OUT YOUR PROJECT BUT THEN WHAT I'M SAID THAN WHAT YOU'RE SORT OF SAYING IS OUR FINANCES SAYING I DON'T SEE E. L. YOU PERSONALLY. IS THAT WHILE WE ARE PROJECTING THAT. IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE LARGE CUTS TO HSS TO A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER BY THE WAY I NOTICE THEY ALL HAPPEN TO BE SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS. RIGHT I MEAN THEY'RE NOT ACROSS THE BOARD WE'RE NOT DOING THIS ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE BUDGET. THERE ARE SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS AND I HAPPEN TO CHAIR THE SUBCOMMITTEE SO I NOTICED THAT YOU KNOW I GO CHECK WHERE ELSE IN THE BUDGET DO WE HAVE THIS AUTOMATIC CLIFFS. IT'S ONLY IN SOCIAL SERVICES AND I'M GOING WHAT IS THAT WHY IS THAT. IS THAT FAIR. I MEAN FOR REALLY THAT ANXIOUS ABOUT IT WHY IS IT THAT. YOU KNOW AND AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW WE'RE IN THE LONGEST EXPANSION SOME POINT WEBER SESSION SO FORTH. AND SO WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN IS THERE A COMMITMENT THEN FOR SOCIAL SERVICES THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE REBUILDING YOUR CUT SO YOU GET. YOU KNOW IT AT WILL CUT FROM EVERYWHERE ELSE EXCEPT YOU BUT I DON'T HEAR THAT EITHER OR SOMEBODY. WHAT I HEAR IS A WHAT IT TAKES SOCIAL SERVICE YOU GET AUTOMATIC CUT AND THEN WE START TALKING ABOUT HOW HE CUT EVERYBODY. WHICH MEANS OF SERVICES TAKES IT ON THE CHIN AGAIN. AND THAT THAT I'M- YOU KNOW. RELEASE STRUGGLING WITH BECAUSE I IT DOESN'T REFLECT MY VALUES I AM SURE DOESN'T REFLECT THE GOVERNOR'S OUTSIDE CERTAINLY HELP. AND SO WE BUILT IT IN AND YOU KNOW IT AND THEN DID YOU SAID YOU WERE DOING OUT YEARS RIGHT WE BUDGET PER YEAR BUT WE DO OUT YEARS BECAUSE WE TRY TO BE RESPONSIBLE. BUT I ALSO AM THINKING LIKE WELL. IS THAT BEING RESPONSIBLE TO BUILD IN AN AUTOMATIC CUT T IT'S EITHER THAT OR WE HAVE TO OWN IT'S LIKE WELL WE ARE PLANNING TO WE DON'T REALLY WANT TO BUT WE ARE PLAIN TO. IN THE ABSENCE OF. YEAH SO I AND THAT'S THE FIRST THAT SIMPLY THE FIRST TO FALL BECAUSE THE ONLY THIS IS THE HOW THESE ARE THE ONLY PROGRAMS THAT HAVE THIS. CUT BILL TEN RIGHT NO ONE ELSE HAS A BUILT IN THAT WAY. WE DON'T DO IT A LOT OF OTHER PLACES BUT WE'RE GONNA BUILD IT IN. AND OUT YOUR PROJECTS FOR SOCIAL SERVICES. SO THAT YOU KNOW SO BASICALLY THAT TRIGGER WE DON'T HAVE TO PULL THE TRIGGER IT JUST AUTOMATICALLY HAPPENS. SO I DON'T I AM. HI I HOPE WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT THAT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE LARGER DISCUSSION WITH LIKE THE FULL NOW WITH BUDGET IN THE GOVERNOR AND AT THE LEADERSHIP LEVEL BUT I REALLY HAVE A TREMENDOUS DISCOMFORT WITH THE IDEA THAT WE YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND WE CAN SAID WELL DOESN'T REALLY HAPPEN UNTIL NEXT YEAR OR SO LITTLE AT ALL IT'S NOT GONNA REALLY HAPPEN IT'S GOT MORE ON PAPER AND YES WE CAN PUSH IT OUT PAPER BUT- AT SOME POINT WHAT WE ARE SAYING THAT IS THAT WE SET UP ALL THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDING ITEM. S. WHICH WOULD TALK ABOUT HOW BUT ALSO OTHERS FOR AN AUTOMATIC FALL. QUOTE IF WE NEED IT. RIGHT AND SO WE DO OUR FIVE YEAR PROJECTION WE BUILD IN AND WE SAY GUESS WHAT. SO THAT IS SO WE'RE NOT BUT WE DON'T DO THAT UNIVERSALLY ACROSS THE BOARD WHICH HAS TO IT FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS AND THEY ALL SEEM TO BE. SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS SO. YOU KNOW. THAT I COULD SELL- THIS IS OUR FIRST HEARING FOR THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SO. I TAKE A LITTLE MORE TIME TO I MADE REFER TO THIS. SAID THE COMMENTS LATER AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT INSTEAD OF GOING DURING THE LONG CUT VERSION EACH TIME. I MEAN I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT. NOW IS THIS THE IN OUR BUDGETING APPROACH BECAUSE- EITHER WE REALLY THINK THERE'S GONNA BE A CLINTON. YOU KNOW I'M I'VE BEEN SUPPORTING EL RAINY DAY FUNDS AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS TO MITIGATE. BUT WERE. BUT WE'RE ALSONOT TREATING EVERYONE THE SAME ARE SIMILARLY RIGHT SELLERS WHAT WE'VE SAID IS THAT CERTAIN PROGRAMS. WE'RE GONNA BUILD IN AN AUTOMATIC CUT AND OTHERONES WERE NOT AND WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO SAY WHAT'S THAT TELLING EVERYBODY. RIGHT AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO REALLY THINK ABOUT AND HAVE A BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT- SO. CERTAINLY YOU KNOW I THINK IN THE PAST AS CERTAINLY AGREED WITH TRYING TO DO THE PERMIT RESTORATION AND IF WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THE CUT AGAIN BECAUSE OF WHATEVER BUDGETARY THINGS WE SHOULD DO IT CONSCIOUSLY. AND NOT AUTOMATICALLY THAT'S MY VIEW ABOUT IT SO- I KNOW WE HAVEN'T QUITE GOTTEN THERE AND ANY PREVIOUS BUDGET AND FINAL GRIEVANCES SO FORTH BUT I DON'T WANT TO DO THINGS AUTOMATICALLY I WANT TO DO THINGS CONSCIOUSLY WE ARE BUDGETS REFLECTIVE PRIORITIS AND WE SHOULD. JUST LIVING I AM YEAH YES WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT. ABOUT TWENTY BILLION DEFICIT ME MAKE. CUTS I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE. BUT WE DID THOSE CONSCIOUSLY. RIGHT AND SO FOUR DEMOCRATS IN THE FUTURE WE'RE IN GOOD TIMES NOW WE SHOULD MAKE THEM CONSCIOUSLY AND NOT JUST AUTOMATICALLY AND BUILT IN. AT A TIME AND LET'S SETTLE IN REALLY INTEND TO DO. AND THEN WE HAVE ALL DIFFERENT TACK CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT HAD A- CUT BUT WE DON'T CáC GREAT BECAUSE WELL DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT'S NOT REALLY HAPPENING IS OUT THERE. BUT WHAT'S BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S OUT THERE SUPPOSED TO MEAN SO. I'M FORTY I KNOWYOU'RE THE ONLY MEMBER FINANCES pMAYBE SOMEONE IN THE AUDIENCE BUT I MEAN I THINK THAT'S A DAY- AND- EAT OKAY WELL IF YOU WISH TO RESPOND- I I'M NOT GONNA HOLD YOU PERSONALLY ACCOUNTABLE BUT I THINK YEAH. I CAN I CAN YOU KNOW I CAN ASSURE THAT THE THAT THE GOVERNOR DOESN'T WANT TO SEE THESE PROGRAMS GET REDUCED- I THINK WHAT. WHAT WE'RE KIND OF EIGHT AND IN IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHY THEY'RE THERE PATTERN ARE YOU KNOW HE'S FUTURE CUTS ARE REFLECTED IN THESE AREAS. I MEAN THERE THERE IT REALLY DOES- COME DOWN TO LIKE WHERE WHERE CAN WE- IF WE HAVE TO MAKE REDUCTIONS WHERE CAN WE MAKE REDUCTIONS NOW I THINK DEFINITELY WORKING WITH LEGISLATURE. TO IF THERE ARE OTHER AREAS OF THE BUDGET- THAT YOU KNOW THERE CAN BE AGREEMENT ON TO MAKE REDUCTIONS AND I THINK WE'RE HAPPY TO OBVIOUSLY HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND I THINK THOSE CONVERSATIONS WILL BE HAPPY- IN THE NEAR FUTURE- BUT I JUST WANTED TO REITERATE THAT YOU KNOW. THE GOVERNOR DOES CARE ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS THESE ARE NOT- HE DOES NOT TAKE YOU KNOW LOOK AT THESE AS AS YOU'RE TAKING THESE REDUCTIONS LIGHT A- UP I'M- BUT WHAT DO YOU. TO GET A WE HAVE STRUCTURAL WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO HAVE A STRUCTURAL YOU KNOW WE MAY NOT. A BUDGET THAT IS. YOU KNOW. UP STRUCTURE IN A SOUND MANNER AND- AGAIN. I THINK. YOU KNOW WITH THE ECONOMY CAN AS THE WEIGHT HOUSE. THAT WE WERE ABLE PUSH THESE REDUCTIONS OUT IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL WE COULD PUSH THEM OUT OF THE WAY THE MULTI YEAR WINDOW COMPLETELY- BUT WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW THINGS LOOK AT THE MAYOR VERSION AND THEN I'M SURE WE'LL BE HAVING MORE CONVERSATIONS. OKAY WELL I APPRECIATE A RESPONSE. A HOPE ALSO MY PREVIOUS QUESTIONS THAT WERE ABOUT HOW ACTIVE WERE PROJECTING SHOWS ALSO MY OWN PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO BE SURE WE DO ACCURATE LONG TERM BUDGETING SO I AND YOU KNOW WE'RE I THINK WE'RE IN THAT TOGETHER AND TERMS OF SAYING. YOU KNOW AND I KNOW I'M SURE LA- WORKS WITH US ON THAT AS WELL SO WE WANT HAVE. ACCURATE IS ACTORS POSSIBLE REALIZING THERE'S ALWAYS YOU KNOW THINGS THAT WE- BOTH WE DON'T CONTROL WE DON'T KNOW BUT- LOOKING OUT TO THE FUTURE. BUT IN THINKING ABOUT AS WE'RE DOING THE OUT YEARS. HOW WERE YOU PLANNING FOR THIS IN A WAY THAT REFLECTS OUR VALUES. RIGHT SO THAT'S WHY I SAID YOU KNOW IF WE'RE IF I WEEKS BACK TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN LEVEL OF EFFORT FOR. LONG TERM SERVICES SUPPORTS AND WE KNOW OUR DEMOGRAPHICS ARE GONNA BE CHANGING OVER YOU KNOW. SO AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A CERTAIN CASELOAD GROWTH I MEAN IT'S AN ESTIMATE BUT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE. CERTAIN TRY YOU KNOW CERTAIN AGE RANGES YOU HAVE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE PEOPLE NEED THESE SERVICES ETCETERA RIGHT I MEAN IT WE CAN MODEL THAT ARE EXPECT THAT IN THE SAME WAY WE CAN MODEL OUR ECONOMY.

ALL RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO AND TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT IN ALL OF THE ITEMS RELATED TO I ITS SS- CAN INTRODUCE YOURSELVES AND THANK YOU WELCOME. I AM MY NAME IS JUDY JACKSON I'M HERE WITH THE ALAMEDA COUNTY FOOD BANK. I WANT TO ANSWER YOUR EARLIER QUESTION ABOUT PROJECTIONS. IN MY CASE I TOOK OVER CARE FOR MISS CAROL BECAUSE SHE HAD NO FAMILY. AND I'M TOOK THE TRAINING FOR AL TIMERS AND WAS TOLD THAT HER CONDITION WILL CONTINUE GET WORSE SO SHE WILL NEED MORE AND MORE CARE. RIGHT NOW I'M TOLD SHE GETS NO MORE I HSS HOURS UNLESS SHE HURTS HERSELF FOR SOMEONE. AND I DON'T THINK THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT SHE NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN HER HOME. FIVE SUPPORT ANY INCREASE IN OUR DATE PROVIDERS SALARIES BECAUSE WE'D BEEN TWO MONTHS TRYING TO FIND AN EXTRA PROVIDER TO TAKE CARE OF HER WHEN HER REGULAR PROVIDER CAN'T DO IT. THANK YOU. I CAN. OKAY WELCOME DOESN'T GET CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES- IN OPPOSITION TO THE TO STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS RELATED TO INCREASE FOR SIX NINE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ON THE FIRST ONE WITH INCREASING THE PENALTY YOU KNOW WE REALLY VIEW THIS AS A KIND OF MAKING A REFERENDUM ON THE NEW PROCESS THAT WE JUST ESTABLISHED LAST YEAR WITHOUT EVEN LIKE IN THAT PROCESS BE TESTED WE'RE ONLY AT STEP ONE OF FOUR OF TESTED 25% OF THE PROCESS NEEDS COUNTIES CERTAINLY WE SHARE THE BILL OF. IT'S REACHED PAYMENT WE KNOW IT. IT INTO. COUNTIES CONSENT GOING TO MORE TO. IN SOME OF THEM. BUT LET'S TEST THE NEW PROCESS THAT WE ALL CAME TOGETHER AND ESTABLISH. A BEFORE MAKING A JUDGMENT CALL ON WHETHER IT WORKS OR NOT AND WHETHER THE PENALTY NEEDS TO BE INCREASED. ON THE ISSUE OF- KIND OF CONTRACT CONSULTANTS FOR BARGAINING. YOU KNOW IN MANY CASES COUNTIES HAVE A- A STANDING UP PARTNERSHIP- ACROSS ALL KIND OF COUNTY CONTACT NOT JUST RELATED AYE ACCESS. AND SO THESE ARE KIND OF AGAIN INDIVIDUAL COUNTY DECISIONS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS OF- COUNTY IS THAT. PARTNER WITH A CONTRACT CONSULTANTS- FOR I'D SAYS FIRST COUNTIES A DON'T YOU KNOW THE AT THE AMOUNT OF AGREEMENT IS PRETTY MUCH AT THE SAME RATE AND SO AGAIN WE THINK THIS. RESTRICTION TO BE UNLIKE ANY OTHER RESTRICTION ON COLLECTIVE BARGAINING- EMITTED NOR IS A PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE ON COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND AGREEMENTS AND HE'S COUNTIES. DO YOU DISEASE. AND SO WOULD OPPOSE. WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FRANK MCCOURT THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THE U. D. W. BARGAINING PROPOSALS A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE PRIOR TO BARGAINING- THE LEGISLATURE HAD OPTIONS- TO IMPOSE BARGAINING ON COUNTIES OR TO DO THE BARGAINING YOURSELVES. THE UNIONS RECOMMENDED LOCAL BARGAINING WE RECOMMENDED STATE BARGAINING AND WE LOST. MANY OF THE REASONS THAT WE ARGUED FOR BY STATE BARGAINING WOULD BE SUPERIOR ARE MANIFEST IN THE DEBATE WE'RE HAVING OVER WHAT THE BARGAINING RULES ARE. IF AT SOME POINT THE STATE'S FOR- ROLE IN LOCAL BARGAINING IS TO IS TO DICTATE THE TERMS NOT THE OUTCOME. IF WE WANT TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE BELIEVE AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY. THAT THERE'S A PREDETERMINED OUTCOME AND THAT IS A GREATER FLOOR OF WAGES FOR EVERYONE WHO DELIVERS AYE HSS WAGES. LOCAL BARGAINING ISN'T THE ONLY WAY FOR YOU TO ACCOMPLISH THAT YOU CAN ESTABLISH THAT IN LAW. YOU CAN ALSO HAVE BARGAINING DONE AT THE STATE LEVEL RATHER THAN THE LOCAL LEVEL THOSE TWO APPROACHES. IN OUR OPINION DO REQUIRE THE STATE PAY MORE THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD. BUT I JUSTWANTED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THE FACT THAT LOCAL BARGAINING ISN'T THE ONLY WAY TO CONCEIVE BARGAINING IT WASN'T OUR IDEA. I'M AND YOU HAVE OTHER OPTIONS RATHER THAN TO INAPPROPRIATELY IN OUR IN OUR OPINION AS THIS PROPOSAL WOULD TO. DICTATE NOT JUST THE TERMS OF THE BARGAINING BUT TO TAKE THE OUTCOMES WHICH IS AN APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU WELCOME MY NAME IS MY NAME IS BRENDA AND I'M HOME CARE PROVIDER AND I'M HERE TODAY TO THE ACTS FOR SUPPORT FOR ADOBE PC A HOME CARE PROVIDERS AS WELL THEY NEED- SICK DAYS JUST AS WELL AS WE DO AT THEIR HOME CARE PROVIDERS JUST LIKE I AM AND THEY DESERVE TO HAVE SICK DAYS RIGHT ALONG WITH SICK PAY THANK YOU.

WHAT ARE YOU SAYING THAT SPEAK NOW TO BOTH SIDES YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE EXPECTING MORE ELDERLY PEOPLE AND EXPECTING MORE DISABLED PEOPLE TO BE REQUIRING THESE SERVICES THAT IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES PROVIDE.

OTHER AUTOMATIC CUTS TO THE SOCIAL PROGRAMS THAT AFFECT THE POOR PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY AND I WAS CERTAINLY OF THE STATE THAT'S NOT HOW WE ROLL HERE. THAT'S NOT HOW WE SHOULD BE.

SEVERAL YEARS THE FOLLOWING PAGES ADDRESS A FEW OF THE POTENTIAL REASONS FOR THAT INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF BABY BOOMERS. ON THE ADVANCES IN MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY HEALTHIER BEHAVIORS- ASSET LIMITS SO THAT IT KIND OF OUTLINES THOSE ARE. REASONS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT RELATE TO THAT DECLINE- THAN THE FOLLOWING PAGE GOES INTO THE BUDGET FOR NINETEEN TWENTY THE ESTIMATED BUDGET WAS NINE POINT SEVEN BILLION IT'S ABOUT THE SAME FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE ADMINISTRATIVE PORTION OF THAT IS ABOUT AN EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE- FOUND MILLION. FOR THE S. P. ADMINISTRATION THAT THE STATE AT THAT THE STATE- CONTRACTS WITH SSA TO PROVIDE. ON WE DO HAVE MOVED INTO THE MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT AND THE PAYMENT STANDARDS THAT ARE OUTLINED THERE FOR YOU AND THEN ALSO.

FOR YOU THERE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE- WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION ON. OKAY THANK YOU A COMMENCEMENT ELIO. REVIEWED THE ESTIMATES A REASON A MAJOR CONCERNS- BUT SIMILAR TO I IT JUST SAYS- SPECIFICALLY ON CASE THAT WE DID JUST NOTE THAT LOOKING AT THE MOST RECENT MONTHLY ACTUAL- CASELOAD ESTIMATES MAY COME IN HIRING ME BUT STILL WE WOULD SEE THAT DECLINE OVERALL BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- WILL BE MONITORING AND LOOK FOR IT PER THAT MAYBE UPDATE.

SURE SO THE WARDEN CARE OR THE ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY ARE PART OF THE CONTINUUM THAT PROVIDES A SUPPORT TO ACCESS THAT SOCIETIES P. POPULATION OUT WE ARE AGAIN AS YOU NOTED OVER ARCHING WE WERE SEEING A- ACTUALLY INCREASING CAPACITY OF THOSE FACILITY TIES BUT FOR THOSE THAT ARE CARING SPECIFICALLY FOR SSI ASSIST PEOPLE POPULATION THERE'S A GREATER DECLINE- AND SO I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE SPECIFICS NUMBERS IF YOU'RE IF YOU'D LIKE TO THERE ARE SOME AND I THINK YOUR AGENDA SPEAKS TO IT A LITTLE BIT LATER AROUND SOME OF THAT- THE- WAYS IN WHICH WE HAVE. ESSENTIALLY A PROXY TO LOOK AT THE DATA MATCHING BETWEEN WHO'S WHO'S IN A RESIDENT IN THOSE FACILITY TYPES IN WHOSE RECEIVING A SOCIETY PROXY THAT WERE USING- BUT I CAN CERTAINLY I'M SURE WITH THE SPECIFIC DATA AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR A FEW PEOPLE LIKE THAT OUR OR LATER ON IN THE AGENDA BUT CERTAINLY WE ARE SEEING A DECLINE SPECIFIC TO- WHEEZING THAT PROXY MEASURE OF THE NUMBER OF THOSE FACILITY TYPES AND CASSIE THIS FACILITY TYPES THAT ARE SERVING THE SS I SS BE POPULATION. OKAY WELL I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT WAS WERE TRANSCRIPTS HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING- I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW YOU KNOW HOW THE POPULATION IS ON SSI SSD IS BEING IMPACTED IN ORDER TO THINKS THAT WE NEED TO DO. TO THE GATE DOBBS YEAH WE ARE OTHER A LOT THE WELL. PROGRAMS PROPOSALS AROUND HOUSING ALSO JUST STRUCK THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE LOSING CARE CARE BOARDING HOMES FOR PEOPLE ON SSI ASSIST P. AND- ALLOWING A DUE TO STUDY I DON'T. THE CASELOAD IS MAYBE DROPPING BUT I AND I DON'T THINK THAT- THAT ACCOUNTS FOR WHY WE HAVE A TEACHER THAT WE HAVE A DECREASE IN BEDS RIGHT. RIGHT SO WE BELIEVE IN CERTAINLY IN THE S. SURVEYS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS CONDUCTED ON WHY SOME OF THOSE FACILITIES AT CLOSE THEY HAVE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED. AT THIS RATE AS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY ASH STRUGGLED WITH AND WHICH CHALLENGED WITH PART OF OUR PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME IS THE HOUSING- THAT'S ASSIST HOUSING FUND- WHICH- ONE OF THREE PURPOSES OF THE FUND IS SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS- STABILIZING. PICKED THE CARE OF THIS POPULATION IN THOSE FACILITY TYPES AND SO AGAIN- BASED ON THE NEEDS THAT IN ANY GIVEN REGION. THIS WILL BE ONE OF THOSE THREE ALLOWABLE USES OF THE FUN AT TO SUPPORT BOTH. A POTENTIAL- STABILIZING RENTER HAVING A RENTAL AGREEMENT EXCHANGE BUT ALSO FOR. A POTENTIALLY IN THE- IMPROVEMENTS TO THE FACILITIES THAT NEED TO BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT THE TO HIGH QUALITY THE AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION. UNDER THE OVERVIEW IS YEAH WE WERE- SUCCESSFULLY ABLE TO- BASICALLY GET. ALLOW PEOPLE UNNECESSARY S. P. TO GET ON- A CAL FRESH RIGHT- AND- SO I JUST WANT TO CHECK IN IN TERMS OF THE FOLLOW UP ON THAT AND DOES SO MANY TOPICS TO READ THEIR OWN ALSO PERSPECTIVE AS WELL BUT FROM- SO HAS A HOUSE THAT IMPLEMENTATION IN ROLLING OUT I'VE BEEN GOING GOING IT'S BEEN- PHENOMENAL AND WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE PARTNERSHIP OF OUR COUNTIES MANY BOOKS ORGANIZATIONS WE HAD A VERY. ROBUST ENGAGEMENT ENGAGE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THROUGHOUT THE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION SO FAR INCLUDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET TO MAKE SURE WE WERE DOING OUTREACH AT A GREATER RATE HAS AND SO THAT THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL WE HAVE- OVER WELL OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND- INDIVIDUALS IN THIS POPULATION AND ROLLED AND THAT NUMBER CONTINUES TO GROW SO- AGAIN JUST GRATEFUL FOR THE PARTNERSHIP ACROSS THE BOARD TO MAKE THAT A SUCCESSFUL IN AND IT HAS IT HAS BEEN JUST THAT SO WILL. NOT DONE THE BEST AT PHENOMENAL SO THAT WORK I ONE THINK THAT THE AND CERTAINLY THE PUT YOUR PARTNER FOR MAKING THIS HAPPEN I KNOW THAT. MEAN WE HAD IT DECADES WE DIDN'T DO IT VERY REASONS- AND THAT WE WERE ABLE TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT AND ATTACK LIMIT THIS AND I THINK THIS SOME THAT GOING TO FIT. ALMOST HOUSEHOLD IS A- OF PEOPLE. DECIDE YOU KNOW WE PUT IN MACINNES TO TRY TO MANY FRAME WHO MIGHT AND GIVEN THIS NATURE FORMULA TO BE SURE WE- TO HELP THEM HARMLESS AND- SO APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK OF THE APARTMENT- IN IN MAKING THAT. HAPPENS OF THANK YOU. AL RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS- AT THE MET. OKAY I CAN'T ASK YOUR QUESTION FOR YOU I THINK.

WE REALLY NEED TO WORK ON AN ADDRESS AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL- YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE HOW IN AND FOOD ENTRANCE SHE JUST. NEEDS PORTABILITY ISSUE HERE- AND I KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE AT GREATEST RISK FOR BECOMING HOMELESS ARE THOSE STACKED. BECAUSE HOUSING COSTS EXCEED YOUR 50% OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOME.

EFFECTIVELY INSURING CERTAIN PEOPLE LIVE BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL AND TO ME THAT IS CAUGHT.

GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR POUND THIS PAM DICK FOSS DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING. IN JOHNSON CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES YOU. ANGELA SHORT LA JEANNIE BELL LA YOU AND IT'S JUST INCREASED FROM TO FINANCE ALL RIGHT SO- LET'S THAT WILL BEGIN WITH THE OVERVIEW OF THE COMMUNICATOR LICENSING PROGRAM. THANK YOU. AT THE FASHION THE TOOL. YES WILL AGREE A STATUE AND IS THE UPDATE ON THE INSPECTION YES THANK YOU OKAY SO- THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY pOVERVIEW OF THE INSPECTION TOOL BUT I'LL JUST LET YOU KNOW THAT- OVER THE PAST YEAR IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAVE DEVELOPED ALL THE TOOLS FOR ALL OUR DIFFERENT FACILITY TYPES AND ALL THREE PROGRAMS- WE PILOTED ALL THREE PROGRAMS COMMUNITY THE CAN THE- CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM THAT THE CHILD CARE PROGRAM IN THE DON'T SENIOR CARE PROGRAM THEY WERE ALL PILOTED SEPARATELY. SO WE'VE BEEN TAKING THAT DATA AND REFINING THE TOOL- AND IS SO WE HAVE AN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN WE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED THE SENIOR KERR TOOL FOR THE RC A FEES AND- WE PLAN TO IMPLEMENT THE OTHER TOOLS FOR THE OTHER FACILITY TYPES THROUGHOUT TWENTY TWENTY BY THE END BY THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY- SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT. SO FAR THE EARLY FEEDBACK HAS BEEN VERY. POSITIVE FROM THE LICENSEES THEY'VE THEY REALLY FELT LIKE THE TOOLS ARE MORE THOROUGH AND GIVE THEM A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE REGULATIONS- AND IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHICH THE PREVIOUS TOOLS DID NOT. SO WELL AS WE COLLECT DATA WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH INFORMATION AS TO WHETHER IT REALLY IS GIVING US A AT A HOLISTIC VIEW TO BE ABLE TO. FOCUS ON THERE'S THOSE AREAS OF. NON COMPLIANCE. RIGHT HELLO. FINANCE WE APPRECIATE THE UPDATE ON THE TOOL NOW. AS WE MOVED FROM KßT TO- TO THE NEW INSPECTION TOOLS WERE STILL USED IT'S STILL BASED ON THE MODEL OF RATE OF HAVING- SERVE I GUESS TRIGGER BASICALLY YOU HAVE SOME INITIAL ELEMENTS IF THOSE TURN OUT NOT TO GO SO WELL THEN IT DELVES IN MORE DEEPLY CORRECT YES RIGHT IT'S A DELL MAIN FOCUS RIGHT TOOL THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE CAT SO IT'S BEST PACIFIC LEAD DEVELOPED OVER THE ARTICLES IN THE REGULATION SO YOU CAN DO A DEEP DIVE FOR THE- NON. WELL I GUESS WHEN THE MY QUESTIONS I HAD- THOUGHTS WAS IS THAT- CERTAINLY IS CO BOTH WHEN YOU DID KITTEN AND NOW WITH THIS NEW TOOL- AND I KNOW YOU COLLECTED DATA TO LOOK AT WHICH PARTICULAR QUESTIONS WOULD BEST REFLECT THAT THE MAIN RATE. SO THAT YOU'D SAID OF DOING EVERYTHING YOU COULD DO- BUT- I WOULD IMAGINE THAT FIRST OF ALL OVER TIME THERE MAY BE SOME EVOLUTION OF THE TOOL- AND ALSO US- I THINK THAT. IN TERMS OF CONTINUOUS EVALUATION OF THE HOW AFFECTED THE TOOL IS AND I APPRECIATE TRYING TO MINIMIZE THE BURDEN ON HERE INSPECTING- THAT IT WAS THERE ANY THOUGHT OR ARE PLANNED TO. MAYBE TAKE A SAMPLE OF THE PLACES BACK TO DO MORE COPPER TO THE SECTION TWO IS A WAY TO EVALUATE THE FACT THIS IS A TOOL ARE TOP. IS THAT INITIAL THE MAIN QUESTION IN BEING SURE THAT IT. ACTUALLY OR FLEX- A BROADER SAID ISSUES RIGHT SO. THE PAGEANT. WELL FULLER INSPECTION A SUB HER EIGHT A SAMPLE AND YOU GO AS IT HAS YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE PICKED IT UP GIVEN HEALTH WE- BUT USING THE TOOL AS IT IS WE HAVE PICKED UP THE THINGS THAT NOW WE PICKED UP BECAUSE WE DID THIS FULLER INSPECTION- NOT JUST ON THE ONE TWO. OBVIOUSLY HAD A PROBLEM BUT ALSO IN SOME THAT. THE INITIAL TOLD OKAY EVERYTHING'S OKAY BUT TURNS OUT WE DO FULL INSPECTION IT'S NOT SO OKAY RIGHT DID SO THAT WE HAVE A MEASURE OF HOW AFFECT. HOW ACCURATE THAT DENNIS YOU'LL I THINK IN TERMS OF JUST US IN A SERVE AN ONGOING ASSESSMENT TOOL OR YOU TAKE A SAMPLE AND YOU SAY OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE COMING AND WE HAD TO FULLER INSPECTION. SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE HOW HOW ACCURATE ARE TOOL ACTUALLY IS IN TERMS OF THE IN TERMS OF INVESTIGATING THAT THE MAIDS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT- THAT- DEPARTMENT SAID. IT IS LOOKING INTO A CONSIDERING. THAT AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT ALL OF THE PILOTS WERE A COMPREHENSIVE TOOL THAT WE DEVELOP THE STANDARD TOOL OUT OF SO IF. IF WE HAD CERTAIN VIOLATIONS AND IN SPECIFIC AREAS IT TYPICALLY. WOULD HAVE VIOLATIONS IN ANOTHER DOMAIN AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO. PAIR THAT UP AS THEY'RE DOING THEIR INSPECTIONS IF THEY HAD A VIOLATION THIS DOMAIN THAT WE WOULD ALSO GO TO THE OTHER DOMAIN SO BUT THERE IS- CONSIDERATION FOR US TO CONTINUALLY. EVALUATE THE DATA TO SEE IF. THOSE FACILITIES THAT WE'VE DONE TO SPOT CHECK INTO COMPREHENSIVE. OKAY I MEAN BECAUSE THERE IS CERTAINLY NO YOU'VE COLLECTED THAT DATA FOR ESTABLISHING THE TOOL ITSELF SIGNED AND DATED DOES EXIST I'M JUST SIR THANK YOUNG ONGOING BASIS. AND TERMS OF. COULD USE A VALUATION KNOWING THAT THE TOOL ITSELF ALSO PERHAPS OF ALL RIGHT AS WE LEARN MORE. AS WELL. THAT IS THE PLAN OKAY ALL RIGHT. OKAY SO. AND I THINK THAT'S ABOUT IT OKAY WELL AND IT SAYS THAT- ALWAYS INTERESTING HEARING FROM PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR FEEDBACK BUT GLAD TO HEAR THAT- FROM WHAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE CLIENTS IS THAT THIS THE SOULS WORKING OUT PRETTY WELL RIGHT WELL SO FAR I MEAN THERE ARE SOME ISSUES WITH THE LENGTH OF HOW LONG IT TAKES BECAUSE IT'S EXTENDED THE TIME FOR THE TOOL BUT FOR THE MOST PART THERE PLEASE BECAUSE THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO GO OVER THE REGULATIONS AND PROVIDE MORE ASSISTANCE. SO WE SURVEYED ALL OF THE LICENSEES AND DURING THE PILOT SO WE COULD GET THEIR FEEDBACK AS WELL AS WELL AS OUR L. P. A.'S AND UTILIZE THAT TO MODIFY THE TOOL OKAY. ALL RIGHT EXCELLENT. OKAY SO LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ISSUE WHICH IS- ON THE ADULT RECREATIONAL RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES AND RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY. OKAY IN THE FIRST QUESTION HOW WITH THE DEPARTMENT GO ABOUT FIGURING OUT HOW MANY SSI SS HE RESIDENTS RESIDE IN THESE FACILITIES- WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITHOUT WE ARE NOW WE NOW COLLECT INFORMATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WHICH WE MATCH WITH OUR ADDRESSES OF OUR LICENSE FACILITIES. BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY GIVE YOU A COMPLETE PICTURE BECAUSE A LOT OF THE TAX ARE DELIVERED TO FAMILIES OR- SOME PEOPLE DON'T EVEN CHANGE THEIR THEIR ADDRESS AND WHEN THEY THEY MOVE SO. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY MORE IN THE CURRENT PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A- OUTWARD FACING PORTAL IN OUR CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK PROGRAM. AND IT'S ALLOWING THE PROVIDERS TO ACTUALLY- BE ABLE TO. A POINT THAT THEY HAVE TO IDENTIFY WHERE THEIR STAFF ARE GOING AND SO THEY CAN ASSOCIATION DISASSOCIATE THROUGH THIS PORTAL SO WORK IN A FOR CONSIDERING USING THAT UTILIZING THAT PORTAL TO ACTUALLY ALLOW THEM TO ACTUALLY- ENTER INFORMATION AND WHETHER THEY HAVE SSI CLIENTS WILL HAVE A TRUE COUNT ACCOUNTING OF THAT AND ALSO OTHER ISSUES SUCH AS HOW MANY DEMENTIA RESIDENTS ARE CARING FOR MENTAL HEALTH OR- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SO THERE AND THERE'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO- EXPLORE THAT OPTION WE EXPECT THAT PORTAL TO BE COMPLETED BY- THIS FALL. WE WOULD WE WOULD NEED LEGISLATION THOUGH TO. MANDATE THIS FOR THE REPORTING OF ALL FACILITIES. AND WE LOOK AT IT IT'S A PROPOSAL FOR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN THAT REGARDS- MORE FOR FIRST LOOKING AT WERE TALKING WITH THE CONTRACTOR TO SEE IF THIS IS EVEN A POSSIBILITY WE THINK AND IT'S LOOKING PROMISING BUT YOU KNOW ONCE WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION THEN WE'RE GONNA. WILL LOOK AT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. GEN THE ADMINISTRATION TIMES ARE JUST RESPOND FINDS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A PROPOSAL OR TRAILER BECAUSE OF RIGHT NOW RELATED TO THAT CASE. AT THIS TIME OKAY ALL RIGHT BUT I GUESS THAT SOMEWHERE POTENTIALLY INVESTIGATING THIS OKAY. AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION HOW MANY OF THESE FACILITIES OF CLOSED IN RECENT YEARS WHAT AFFECTS HAVE THOSE CLOSEST HAD ON CAPACITY OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY ONE HUNDRED FACILITIES HAVE CLOSED- AND WE'VE LICENSE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY TWO HUNDRED. IT'S SO THE CAPACITY INCREASED BY FOUR POINT 8% AND FROM THE DATA THAT WE HAVE ON SSI IT LOOKS LIKE THE SSI CAPACITY DECREASED BY TWO POINT 6% OKAY. IN THE ANY IDEAS TO THE REASON FOR THE DAY WELL THE WAIT WE HAVE- MINIMAL INFORMATION WE SURVEYED THE FACILITIES THAT CLOSED IN THE LAST YEAR AND ASKING THEM SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON ON REASONS FOR AND IT WAS. MORE LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATE SOME. AND THE GENERAL YOU KNOW THE JUST THE GENERALLY HIGH OPERATING COSTS WERE WERE FACTORS TO WEAR THE SAME. THEY CLOSED BUT IT'S ABOUT WASN'T ALL OF THEM THERE WERE SOME FOR NON COMPLIANCE. BUT DEFINITELY THE LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES WERE- WERE MENTIONED OKAY. JOINT JUST WANTED AGAIN EMPHASIZE THAT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY- COMMITTED TO LOOKING AT THESE FACILITY TYPES AS PART OF A CONTINUUM ICE WHEN IT RE RE EMPHASIZE THAT AGAIN AND THAT'S AGAIN WHY- ONE OF THE USES OF THE PROPOSED SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IS SPECIFIC TO STABILIZING THESE FACILITIES TYPE SO WE ABSOLUTELY RECOGNIZE THAT CHALLENGE IN THAT IS PART OF THE SOLUTION THAT WE'RE PROPOSING AT THIS TIME. OKAY AND I KNOW WILL BE DELVING INTO THE SEVEN FIFTY MILLION AND IN THE FUTURE HEARING. BUT IN TERMS OF. SERVICES WITH A SEVEN FIFTY MILLION BUT- HOW YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF THE SEVEN FIFTY MILLION DO YOU THINK YOU'LL NEED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WE ARE CURRENTLY PROPOSING TO EARMARK AT THE DOLLARS- WITHIN THAT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOR ANY OF THE SPECIFIC AT THREE PURPOSES THAT THE FUNDS WE WILL LEAVE THAT TO REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS TO PROPOSE TO ASK BASED ON THEIR NEEDS ASSESSMENTS SO IT WILL VARY ACROSS. REGIONS IN THE STATE- LATELY FURTHER THIS WAY WAY UP THOSE INTO SPECIFICALLY ALLOCATE AND THAT MAY BE DECIDED AT A MORE LOCAL LEVEL BY THE REGIONAL MINISTERS WHATEVER MECHANISM IN OF DEVELOPING. THEN I GUESS THE QUESTIONS AND THEN AS THE BUSINESS AND THEY'RE A COME ENTIRELY OTHER CENTER FIFTY MILLION BUT HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD WE NEED THAT AND TO. ADDRESS THIS VERY ISSUE ABOUT. TRYING TO STABILIZE SO I MEAN I WOULD DOUBT SO THEY MAY NOT ALL COME OUT THAT'S A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF SCALE OF AND WHETHER DEBT THAT'S THE DECISIONS CAN BE MADE BY HER MACES DECISIONS ON THE SEVEN FIFTY MILLION. IS STILL UP I GUESS IS STILL UP IN THE AIR TO. BUT I'D TO STOP DISTRACTING LIKE SKILL WISE HOW MUCH MONEY IF WE IF IT WAS SO DECIDED WITH ARE WE TALKING ABOUT TO ADDRESS THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. THE FINANCE I DON'T SEE THEM. WITH THE WITH DEMONSTRATION DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A PROPOSAL ON ANY OF THAT RIGHT NOW TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE THAT WOULD BE A CONSIDERATION THAT WOULD SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD- PROBABLY PROPOSAL CONSIDER AND THE MASTER ENTERS A CONVERSATIONS GOING ON BUT RIGHT NOW UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE AN ESTIMATE ON THAT DATE ALL RIGHT SO I MEAN I'M SO. I HEARD YOU SAID YOU HAVE A PROPOSAL NOT ACTUALLY ASKING FOR PROPOSAL BUT I THINK AND NUMBER FOR US TO FIGURE OUT. YOU KNOW THE SCALE RATE. HAVING SOME IDEA OF OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT THE DECISIONS MADE OR NOT BUT HOW MUCH MONEY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT TO JUST ADDRESS THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE BECAUSE WE CAN THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS WE CAN THROW INTO THE COURT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION BUT IT TURNS OUT WE HAVE. BY THE WAY WE DO THIS ALL TIME BUDGET RIGHT WE HAVE LET'S SAY TWO BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF DEMAND FOR THINGS THAT ALSO IS THE FALL THAT SAME POCKET THEN WE HAVE TO HAVE A WHOLE NOTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT SO I'M JUST TRYING TO GET SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE GETTING A SENSE OF. WHAT THE SCALE OF YEAH I WAS A WOULD ADDRESS IN THE SENATE FIFTY MILLION WHILE NOT THAT YOU'VE SUPPOSEDLY ALLOCATING IT I HEARD YOU SAY THAT BUT- SO ROUGHLY HOW MUCH MONEY HE- IS THIS. GOING TO. IT WILL WE NEED IF WE WERE REALLY ADDRESS THAT AT EARLIER DID YOU HAVE SOME. COMMENTS ON THAT GINNY FELLOW AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I THINK IT'S A GOOD QUESTION I THINK IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO HOW YOU WANT TO APPROACH IT TOO AND I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL NOW IS OPEN TO SORT OF A COMBINATION OF BOTH- HELPING TO STABILIZE THE FACILITY'S. FROM LIKE AN INFRASTRUCTURE PERSPECTIVE- VERSES KIND OF THIS WITH THIS PIECE ABOUT KIND OF THE RATE AND HOW TO STABILIZE IT VIA SORT OF SOME SORT OF SUBSIDY. SUBSIDIZATION OF THE RATE. SETTING THOSE ARE. THE STRIKING A BALANCE THERE SORT OF IS THAT. PART OF THE QUESTION IF IT'S MORE A AND THOSE ALSO- INVOLVE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT ONE TIME VERSES ONGOING COSTS AS WELL SO. WE'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE ANY KIND OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. ON TO YOU OR TO STAFF AS YOU START TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO HOW YOU'D WANT TO FRAME THAT QUESTION BUT- THOSE ARE IMPORTANT. KEY QUESTIONS I THINK TO ADDRESS FIRST. BUT I THINK IT WOULD ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE GETTING CLOSER TO ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT THE- QUOTE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ADDING WE HAVE TO START. GETTING A SENSE OF HOW MUCH. EACH PIECE. THAT WE NOW SAY OH IT'S GOING TO BE ADDRESSED BY THAT. PART OF MONEY IT'S UNDER FIFTY MILLION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND- SOMETIMES IT MAY NOT BE AN EXACT NUMBER MAY BE YOU KNOW A BIT OF A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS AND- AND- YOU KNOW HOW THE ACTUAL DECISIONS BE MADE JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER DISCUSSION WE'RE HAVING RIGHT BECAUSE HE SAID WELL WE'LL GET THE ABOUT THE REGIONAL MINISTERS DECIDING ON THE LOCAL LEVEL WHETHER TO GO TO SPEND THE MONEY ON THAT. GOT EIGHT HEARD THAT WE WILL HAVE A WHOLE NOTHER DISCUSSION WHEN I GOT LIVE. TO DISCUSS THE PRESENT BECAUSE OF VARIOUS WAYS OF MAKING DECISIONS HERE RIGHT NOW THAT'S FOR THE FUTURE HEARING BUT- I THINK IS WORTH. AS WE ROLL THROUGH HEARINGS WE HAVE HERE AND YOU KNOW WE'RE HEARING ITEMS LIKE THIS ONE AND THE ANSWERS WELL WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE STABILIZATION. THROUGH THAT OTHER PART OF MONEY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GETA SENSE OF SCALE OF OKAY. FINE THEN. IF WE WERE ACTUALLY GOING TO ADDRESS IT IN THAT POT HOW MUCH. ROUGHLY HOW MUCH MONEY ARE WE TALKING AND EAT AND I SAY HI. ROUGHLY HOW MUCH MONEY. THANK YOU FOR TALKING. TENS OF MILLIONS OF A HUNDRED BILLION TEN MILLION A MILLION YOU KNOW WHAT. WHAT WHAT IS THE SCALE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT SO WITH THE SWORD THE BOUNDARIES OF THAT AND I WAS. IN THE DECISIONS MAY BE MADE EXACTLY. WHERE WE ARE IN THAT RANGE THE WHAT IS SORT OF THE- RANGE OF MONIES THAT WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT TO. TO ADDRESS THE GAPS YOU KNOW THE STABILIZE OVER HOW MUCH RENTAL ASSISTANCE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THAT WOULD KEEP PEOPLE FROM BEING THROWN OUT OF THEIR HOUSES ETCETERA FOR THIS. PARTICULAR POPULATION IN THIS GROUP SO THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING TO. GET MY ARMS AROUND UNDERSTOOD IN TE IN IN JUST TO THE- TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE HEARD EARLIER RELATED TO PROJECTIONS I THINK THAT. THE COMPLICATING FACTOR IN COMING UP WITH THOSE PROJECTIONS IS THAT THIS SECOND. I'M AND WE CAN'T QUITE PREDICT. WHO'S GOING TO SELECT IDENTIFY WHICH CARE SAID. AND WHAT'S MORE. THE MOST APPROPRIATE. IT'S BEING ABLE TO STAY WITHIN THEIR AND THEIR- MATCH. PROVIDER CAN. WHETHER IT THIS AT. THE IS PART OF THIS SINCE I THINK THAT'S BEEN. THE MOST CALM. FACTOR WHEN WE THINKING A- WHICH- IS. WHAT BE THE- AT PLACE. IN SETTING FOR ANY GIVEN AND- JEWEL. OKAY I MEAN I GET THAT. DOWN THERE THERE MAY BE ALTERNATIVE SO THEY WON'T MISS A STAY IN THIS BUT AT LEAST. FOR THIS. ANY AND- THIS IS. IN TERMS OF THE OF THIS SUMMER SO IS THAT OKAY GIVEN THE CAR POPULATION THAT THERE IN THE SITUATION ASSUMING THEY MAY MOVE TO SOMETHING ELSE AND THEY WORK OUT BETTER OR SOMETHING BUT JUST EVEN THE CURRENT POPULATION ASSUMING THE STATE'S BUT HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD WE NEED FOR THEM TO QUOTE STATE BUT NOW WE MAY PROVIDE A BETTER ALTERNATIVE AND THEY WON'T SAY BUT WE DON'T NEED THAT MUCH MONEY IT'S AT- BUT I DID GET AND IT'S JUST. JUST THE WAY TO GET A HANDLE OF. ON THE END WE HAVE TO DECIDE IS YEAH WE- IS THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION THE RIGHT NUMBER RIGHT IN THE END ALSO RIGHT AS WE GO BACK AND FORTH I APPRECIATE. YOU KNOW. BE KIND OF LIKE THINK THAT NUMBER BASED ON VARIOUS FACTORS IT CETERA. BUT I THINK THIS IS A SORT OF A CHECK ON. IS A HUNDRED TO BE IT. WE NEED FOR MORE OR LESS USUALLY IT'S MORE THAN LAST BUT YOU KNOW THAT SO JUST AS WELL AS EVERY EVERY TIME WE HAVE A CONVERSATION WE SAY OH YEAH WE ADDRESS IT THROUGH THAT PART OF MY THE- STATE OKAY- HOW MUCH MORE MONEY TO. WE NEED FOR THAT POT. OF REALLY ADDRESS IT THAT WAY. SO IF THERE'S A WAY TO GET BACK WITH SOME SORT OF. ESTIMATE RANGE OR SOMETHING ON THAT SCALE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL- JUST SO THAT WE GET A SENSE OF HOW THIS IS ALL STARTING TO ADD UP. IN THE END SO. YES I KNOW YOU HAVE TO MAKE A FEW ASSUMPTIONS THERE BUT IT'S SERVICE. ESTIMATE OKAY. RIGHT. YES THEY DO OKAY SO THE THIRD QUESTION JUST DESCRIBE THE PROCESS THAT OCCURS WHEN THE FACILITY IS CLOSING ON THE ROLE OF C. C. L. IN THE PROCESS OF THE ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES THAT- HOUSE CLIENTS UP TO THE AGE OF FIFTY NINE THEIR REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THE DEPARTMENT WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF A SALE OF THE PROPERTY OR CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP. THE RC A FEES GREATER THAN SEVEN BEDS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A CLOSURE PLAN TO THE DEPARTMENT WHICH WE NEED TO APPROVED ONCE THAT CLOSURE PLAN IS APPROVED THEY HAVE. SIX THEY CAN HAVE TO GIVE A SIXTY DAY NOTICE TO ALL THE RESIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES- THERE ALSO REQUIRED TO. PROVIDE FACILITIES WITHIN A FIFTY MILE RADIUS TO THE RESIDENT AND THEIR FAMILIES- AND THE LATE WE THEY ARE REQUIRED TO GIVE THE NUMBER THE NAME AND PHONE NUMBER OF THE OMBUDSMAN. AND THAT THE ROLE OF CCL WE ASSIST WE PULL AND ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE PET PUBLIC GUARDIANS- APS- WHOEVER WE NEED TO UP TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST IN RELOCATING THE RESIDENTS WE PLAYED HI AN ACTIVE ROLE WE CHECK ON THEM AFTER THEIR RELOCATED AFTER A- WEEK OR TWO TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR ACCLIMATED. IN THE FACILITY. MANY COME SELL EL CANCEL SHORT LA OF- AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN LIGHT OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S HOMELESSNESS PROPOSALS THERE'S BEEN INCREASED FOCUS ON BOARDING CARE FACILITIES OR MORE SPECIFICALLY THE SICEL LICENSE NOT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES AND RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY. WE WERE JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE ARE SOME DATA LIMITATIONS WHICH REALLY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO FULLY UNDERSTAND WHO THESE FACILITIES SERVE AND THE SEVERITY OF THE CLOSURE PROBLEM- SOME QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE OUR- AS AS WAS MENTIONED IT'S DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE HOW MANY AS A SIZE AS P. RESIDENTS ARE IN THESE FACILITIES BUT ALSO RESIDENTS YOU MAY RECEIVE OTHER TYPES PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AND- HOW HAVE CLOSURES IMPACTED THESE LOWER INCOME MORE VULNERABLE RESIDENTS IN PARTICULAR. AND THEN FINALLY WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS THESE FACILITIES AT ALL- EITHER TO COST OR TO LACK OF SUPPLY A MORE FOR SOME OTHER REASON SO- WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THESE QUESTIONS. SHE THE- IN THE COMMENTS OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL- YOU KNOW EXCEPT THE IT'S- FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE DATA TOGETHER AND KNOW THAT- TO CERTAIN DEGREE IT'S CHALLENGING RIGHT YOU KNOW ITS- THEN WE ALSO PEOPLE DON'T LOS NOW WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND NOW YES RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES WHO ARE NOW ASK QUESTIONS OF PEOPLE MAY NOT NECESSARILY WANT TO ANSWER ALL OF THEM BECAUSE IT CETERA BUT I MEAN I THINK WE NEED TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET A BETTER HANDLE ON. ON THIS AND- NOW WITH WITH THE GUILT DOLE. BUT CHALLENGED BY- NESSA'S IRATE THAT DOESN'T ALLOW PEOPLE TO PAY IT NOW THAT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR FACILITIES IS- AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT I HEARD ABOUT THE DECREASING NUMBER AT THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE THAT'S THE PAYMENT RATES PEOPLE CAN'T DATE THEY HAVE A CEILING WHAT THEY COULD AFFORD TO PAY AND THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FRIGHTENED SO THAT'S- GREEN CHALLENGES FOR OPERATORS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T. THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO OPERATE EIGHT AND THEN- AND THEN SO WHAT CAN WE TRY TO DO TO DO THAT HOW DO YOU DO THAT YOU KNOW MORE TARGETED TYPE THING WORDS I THINK WE'LL TALK ABOUT SOME FIFTY MILLION WITH ONLY GET TO THAT. AND ALSO JUST THE YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT THE WHAT WAS THE SCOPE- TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEFINE THE SCOPE OF THE- OF THE OF THE PROBLEM. IN ADDITION. TO DOING NAY. TO AT LEAST GET ENOUGH THAT. PICTURE SO WE KNOW WHAT. KIND OF SCALE OF INTERVENTION WE NEED TO. TO ENGAGE IN. SO APPRECIATE THAT SO I LOOK FOR TO OUR ONGOING CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS I'M SURE THIS WILL COME BACK UP AGAIN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. THE LARGER POT LATER ON SO. THANK YOU. I DO WANT TO ADD THAT WE HAVE EMPHASIZED THE PREVENTION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BECAUSE OF ALL THE MEDICAL CARE ISSUES THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THESE FACILITIES THAT THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE NOT EQUIPPED TO UNDERSTAND THEY'RE NOT CLINICIANS AND SO WE'VE REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT AND HOPE TO ATTEMPTED. TO REDUCE THESE CLOSURES. ARMS SO YOU KNOW WE'LL BE TRACKING THAT MORE WE JUST STARTED CHANGING OUR MISSION YOU KNOW TWO YEARS AGO SO. APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE A SOCIAL SIDE OF SOCIAL SERVICES AS TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITIES FOR PEOPLE TO. I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING HARD ON THAT OKAY- SO WE MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE THE BCP A CARE GIVER BACKGROUND CHECKS SO THIS PROPOSAL PURPLE PROPOSES ARE IS REQUESTING SIX ANALYST POSITIONS STAFF SERVICES SALES AND ONE MANAGER. WE HAD A TREMENDOUS BACKLOG IT WAS IDENTIFIED IN AN AUDIT A FEW YEARS AGO SO WE LOOKED INTERNALLY TO SEE HOW WE COULD PROVIDE EFFICIENCY SO WE ACTUALLY- JUST PUT WE HIRED TEMP POSITIONS IN THE BLANKET AND CREATED A UNIT THAT WE FOUND TREMENDOUS- EFFICIENCIES AND THAT WE PRIOR IT USED ARTS SIMPLIFIED INVENTION AND- EXEMPTIONS YOU TO TAKE TWO HUNDRED DAYS WE GOT IT DOWN TO SEVEN. SO THE SIMPLIFIED AND INSPECT SOME SINS WERE INTERSPERSED WITH THE X. INTO THE- THE JERK. CRIMINAL EXEMPTIONS AND SO THEY WOULD JUST IN WE PULLED ALL THEM OUT AND THEY WE HAVE A STE CREATORS SEPARATE UNITS WERE ASKING FOR THOSE POSITIONS NOW TO BE PERMANENTLY ESTABLISHED. ALL RIGHT. HELLO AFTER REVIEWING THE PROPOSAL WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS FINANCE. OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO. APPRECIATE THE SUCCESS IN FRONT SAID TWO HUNDRED SEVEN DAYS THE GOOD JOB. FULL EMPLOYED FASTER AND YES IN A WIN WIN THAT'S EXCELLENT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT HOUSE WITH ON ISSUE NUMBER FOR THE RECIPIENT QUALITY OVERSIGHT STAFFING RESOURCES. SO THIS PROPOSAL IS REQUESTING THREE POSITIONS TO EIGHTY P. A.'S THAT TRAVEL OUT OF STATE TO DO THE OUT OF STATE GROUP HOME INSPECTIONS AND CERTIFY THE GROUP HOMES HONEST AS WELL AS ONE AS A SAM ONE- WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO A. G. P. A.'S THAT TRAVEL OUT OF STATE WE WEREN'T ABLE TO DO ALL OF THE CODE AND THE COMPLAINT INVESTIGATIONS ON SITE- AND SO WE BELIEVE TO AND TWO EXTRA POSITIONS WILL GIVE US THE ABILITY TO. CREATE ALL THE CERTIFICATIONS COMING UP AS WELL AS AS THE COMPLAINT INVESTIGATIONS. AND THEN I'M- OKAY. JOINT GO AHEAD INTO THE REMAINING QUESTION YEAH- SORRY THAT YOU HAD A QUESTION I DON'T KNOW THAT'S OKAY WHAT YOU TO GO ANSWER ALL FOUR OF THEM AND THEN ON HOW MANY OUT OF STATE FACILITIES HAVE ONGOING CERTIFICATION THEY DON'T THERE'S NO TEMPORARY CERTIFICATION THEY APPLY FOR CERTIFICATION WE GO OUT THERE AND THEY EITHER GET IT OR THEY DON'T SO WE HAVE CURRENTLY WE HAVE TWENTY SIX CERTIFIED FACILITIES- IN ELEVEN STATES. AND WHAT IS THE CURRENT RATIO OF FACILITIES. HER INSPECTOR WITH THE TWO WE HAVE NOW IT'S THIRTEEN IT FLUCTUATES A GOES UP AND IT GOES DOWN BUT BUT MINIMALLY- IT'S TYPICALLY TAKES THEM FIVE DAYS TO COMPLETE. AN INSPECTION WHAT WITH THE TRAVEL IN THE RIGHT UP- SO IT'S- WE BELIEVE THE TWO POSITIONS WILL REALLY ALLOW US TO. DO ALL OF THE COMPLAINING BASS OCCASIONS ON SITE. NUMBER FOR THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE INCLUDED IN TWENTY NINETEEN BETTER THAT REQUIRED ALL OF THE STATE FACILITIES TO BE CERTIFIED AS AS T. R. TWO PIECE BY TWENTY TWENTY WILL THE DEPARTMENT BE ABLE TO MEET THIS GOAL WITH ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. AND DID THAT THE DEPARTMENT FOR SEE THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES LAST YEAR WHEN THE TRAILER BILL WAS. DISCUSSED. WELL AT THE TIME WE THOUGHT IT WAS PREMATURE TO ASK FOR MORE POSITIONS AND THOUGHT WE COULD WE COULD SOAR BUT- THE MORE CLOTHES- BUT AS TIME HAS GONE ON AS AS I SPOKE EARLIER WHEN WE THINK THAT TWO ADDITIONAL POSITIONS WILL. ALLOW US TO MEET THIS GOAL. HELLO COMMENTS REVIEW THE PROPOSAL TO HAVE ANY MAJOR CONCERNS AT THIS TIME THANK YOU FINANCE. RIGHT AND TAKE A GUEST WHEN THE WELL. SO I DID HAVE A QUESTION IN TERMS OF. SO WELL I GUESS THE MORE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION AND TRY IT SAYS THAT SO. WHY WHY DO WE HAVE OUT OF STATE. THE HOMES THE FIRST IS.

THE OTHER GROUP TO JUST BECAUSE GEOGRAPHICALLY NEED TO. KEEP THEM OUT OF THE STATE BECAUSE OF. RELATIONSHIPS OR OTHER TYPES OF ENGAGEMENT THAT. TO KEEP THEM SAFE STATE PROBABLY THERE'LL BE DANGEROUS FOR THEM ARE ARE CHALLENGING FOR THEM TO BE ANYWHERE WITHIN THE STATE IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S RIGHT YES OKAY.

MANDATED THAT WE HAD TO DO AN INCREASE REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT OF THOSE FACILITIES THAT HAD A HIGH USE OF PSYCHOTROPIC DOT DRUGS FOR CHILDREN AND SO- WE COME BACK EVERY TWO YEARS AND ASK FOR- CONTINUED FUNDING AND SO WE KNOW IT'S AN ONGOING WORKLOAD SO WE'RE JUST ASKING TO MAKE THESE POSITIONS PERMANENT.

IS A GREAT PRIME PRIMARY IMPORTANCE TO US I WANTED TO POINT OUT JUST A CLARIFICATION I THINK WE KIND OF DO SOME LANGUAGE ING ISSUE UNDER THE SS I SS P. WE TALK ABOUT THE FACILITIES THAT ACCEPT THE SS I SS P. THAT'S NOT AN OPTION IF A PERSON IS LIVING IN A FACILITY AND BECOMES ELIGIBLE. THEY GET TO STAY IT'S NOT ABOUT THE FACILITY ACCEPTING THEM SO I JUST CAUTION IS ABOUT THAT TERMINOLOGY. AND WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUR BACK OF THE NAPKIN KIND OF HOW DO WE LOOK AT THIS ALL OF 70% OF OR SS I SS P. RECIPIENTS ARE ADULTS THAT ARE DISABLED AS OPPOSED TO THE 30% WE CAN DO THE MATH AND SAID 70% OF GONNA GET ALL BURKE. AND THEN THAT'S GONNA BE THIS BIG PROBLEM IS BECAUSE WE DO HAVE FEWER- FACILITIES THAT WE CAN MOVE A PERSON IN WHOSE ALREADY QUALIFIED FOR THE SS I SS P. SO I WOULD REMIND THE COMMENT I MADE BEFORE WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT PATCHES. WE'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE FABRIC FEDERAL POVERTY LAMENT BUT WE CAN PATCH OVER TO ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATORS OF THESE FACILITIES TO GET A REASONABLE. DAILY RATE. OKAY THANK YOU.

WE WILL SEE THE BOARDING CARE FACILITIES THAT WE ARE LOSING WE DO UNDERSTAND THERE'S DATA LIMITATIONS BUT WHAT THE DATA THAT WE DO HAVE TO DAYS SAYS THAT. IN THE LAST THREE YEARS FORTY FIVE FACILITIES AND OVER TWELVE HUNDRED BEDS HAVE CLOSED IN LA COUNTY THAT PROVIDE- SERVICES YOU INDIVIDUALS ON SSI. BUT HAVE THIS YEAR IS NOT ALONE IN THAT IS CREATING AN ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES IN OUR ABILITY TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. SOME OF THESE FACILITIES ARE HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION IT'S ALSO IMPACT IN ON OUR CONTINUUM OF CARE BECAUSE THEY ALSO SERVE AS A STEP DOWN FACILITY. AND THAT IS A LEADING TO WE HAVE MORE INDIVIDUALS AND HOSPITALS THAT WE CANNOT DOWN LEADING TO MORE INDIVIDUALS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. GET IN. CREATING A SYSTEMIC ONE.

PRETTY GOOD OKAY SELECT ALL RIGHT- AND THEN I THINK WE HAVE A PROPOSAL FOR INVESTMENT SO THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. SEE THIS IS FROM CWD A RIGHTS AND HANSON EXPAND AND ENHANCE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES ALL RIGHT WELCOME. SO EASY ASKS YOU CAN KEEP THREE MINUTE PRESENTATION OF THE BUDGET REQUESTS WE MAY HAVE WITH QUESTIONS MORE OPPORTUNITIES EXPLORE. THE THINGS. SHE'S GOOD AFTERNOON TO EIGHT A CIRCUMVENT. RED LIGHTS ON CAN YOU HEAR ME YES GOT IT OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME ASSURING MIX BATON AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF DISABILITY AND AGING SERVICES. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND A BROAD COALITION OF STAKEHOLDERS TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO REDUCE SENIOR HOMELESSNESS BY EXPANDING AND ENHANCING THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM. WE'RE REQUESTING A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING STATE FUNDS. THEAPS PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED ESTABLISHES A STATEWIDE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN RESPONSE PROGRAM OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO. SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT RAPID GROWTH OF THE SENIOR POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. THE INDIVIDUALS WE'RE SEEING HAVE MORE COMPLEX NEEDS AND NEED MORE HELP THAN WE CAN GIVE THEM RIGHT NOW. THIS IS COMPOUNDED BY THE HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS PARTICULARLY THREATENING FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE WHO ARE MARGINALLY HOUSE. WHEN A PS WAS FIRST CREATED WE DID NOT ANTICIPATE THESE TRENDS AND GROWING NEEDS. APS CLIENTS ARE AT UNIQUE RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS DUE TO THE TO ABUSE AND SELF NEGLECT. DEEP DESTABILIZING LIFE EVENTS SUCH AS FINAL UP SORRY FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION OR LOSS OF A PARTNER CAN QUICKLY ESCALATE TO AN ONGOING STATE OF HOUSING CRISIS. THE CURRENT FUNDING WHICH IS MOSTLY COUNTY REALIGNMENT DOESN'T COVER THIS NEW GROWING COHORT THAT NEEDS MORE INTENSIVE SERVICES. SAID LIKE TO SPEAK BRIEFLY ABOUT RECENT A RECENT SUCCESS WE'VE HAD IN SAN FRANCISCO AT THE HOME SAFE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM IS HELP BRING OUR APS TEAM IN CLOSER COLLABORATION WITH OUR HOMELESSNESS DEPARTMENT AND CONTINUUM OF CARE. AND IT'S PROVIDE A CRITICAL NEW RESOURCES TO HELP KEEP PEOPLE HOUSE. WE SEEN REALLY GREAT SUCCESS WITH THESE EFFORTS- I JUST WANT TO SHARE ONE EXAMPLE. HOBBY YEAR NOT HIS REAL NAME IS A SEVENTY THREE YEAR OLD MAN LIVING ALONE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPERTY FOR FORMALLY HOMELESS SENIORS. HE WAS REFERRED TO HOME SAVE SUPPORT DUE TO SELF NEGLECT. DID WAS ONGOING HOARDING IN CLUTTERING BEHAVIORS IS HEALTH AND SAFETY OR COMPROMISE AND HE HAD RECEIVED AN EVICTION NOTICE. HE COULDN'T OPEN THE DOOR WAS UNIT THE WINDOWS IN HIS UNIT WERE BLOCKED BY CLOTHING PILED UP TO THE CEILING. HE'D BEEN SLEEPING ON A PALLET IN THE HALLWAY OF THE BUILDING. HE HAD FAILED HIS LAST THREE UNIT INSPECTIONS AND RECEIVED AN EVICTION NOTICE. OF YOUR WAS WORKING WITH A LEGAL CLINIC FOR ASSISTANCE WITH THE EVICTION NOTICE BUT NEEDED MORE INTENSIVE SUPPORT IN CONNECTION TO SUPPORT OF SERVICES. HE HAD TO UNDERGO A DEEP CLEANING AND IS HOME BUT WAS HESITANT TO DO SO HE DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY ALICE THINGS. IT TOOK SEVERAL VISITS FOR HOME SAFE SOCIAL WORKER TO BUILD REPORT AND GAIN HAVE YEARS TRUST BUT SHE WAS ABLE TO COLLABORATIVELY DEVELOP A PLAN WITH HIM. USING HOME SAFE FUNDS WE SCHEDULE INCLUDED A DEEP CLEANING OF HIS UNIT. WE WORK TO THE CLIENT TO IDENTIFY NEEDED REPAIRS AND COORDINATED WITH PROPERTY MANAGEMENT TO SCHEDULE THE FIXES. WE HELP THEM GET CONNECTED TO NECESSARY RESOURCES INCLUDING IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND MONEY MANAGEMENT. AND DEVELOPED HIS OWN PERSONAL SAFETY NET. WITH A DEEP CLEANING COMPLETE. AND HAVE YOUR CONNECTED TO OTHER ONGOING SUPPORTS WE CLOSE THE HOME SAFE CASES A SUCCESS. WE'RE ALSO FINDING THROUGH HOME SAFE THAT THESE CASES REQUIRE EVEN MORE TIME AND DEDICATED ATTENTION THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED. SO WHAT THE PROS PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU WILL GET THE STATE. THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY WILL STRENGTHEN A CRITICAL SAFETY NET SERVICE. WITH A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT THE APS PROGRAM CAN ADDRESS THE COMPLEX NEEDS OF THE GROWING OLDER ADULT POPULATION. AND WORK TO COMBAT SENIOR HOMELESSNESS. INCREASE-STAFFING WILL ALLOW FOR LONGER TERM CASE MANAGEMENT AND FOR CASE WORKERS TO INTERVENE WITH OUR MOST VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS AT AN EARLIER POINT. HOPING TO AVERT SOME OF THE MORE DIFFICULT CRISIS SITUATIONS AND CONNECT PEOPLE TO ONGOING STABILIZING RESOURCES. THANK YOU- ANY COMMENTS FROM. SOCIAL SERVICES ALL RIGHT HELLO. FINANCE ALL RIGHT- SO FIRST WHAT THE HUNDRED MILLION IS THIS A ONE TIME IS THIS AND I AND I MEAN. THAT THIS IS THE ON GOING. IT'S AN ON IT'S AN ON GOING SO IT'S BUT I DID MILLION IS FOR THE FIRST YEAR OUR SYSTEM MULTI YEAR SO I'M JUST RANDY STAND WHAT YOUR REQUEST FUND AT. MONEY WEISS'S SAYS THAT'S UNDER MILLIONS THOSE UNDER MILLION OVER X. YEARS VALUES FIRST YEAR WITH ON GOING. THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN IT'S A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST THAT WOULD START IN THE BUDGET YEAR. OBVIOUSLY START DATES. CAN HAPPEN RIGHT WELL THE AS WELL IF WE ACTUALLY GET TO BUY ME YOU'RE ALL YOU'RE PROPOSING REQUESTING IS HUNDRED MILLION EVERY YEAR A YEAR AND IT WOULD DO IT WOULD BE FOR THINGS THAT WOULD IT WOULD LOWER THE AGE- OF ELIGIBILITY FOR ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES FROM SIXTY FIVE TO SIXTY. WHICH ALIGNS ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES WITH OTHER OLDER AMERICANS ACT PROGRAMS AND IS ALSO RESPONSIVE TO THE RESEARCH. THAT THE FASTEST GROWING GROUP OF HOMELESS ADULTS ARE PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY SO WE OBVIOUSLY ARE NOT TAKING IT TO FIFTY BUT WE'RE BUT WE'RE BRINGING IT DOWN. THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER HOMELESS OR AT. HIGHEST RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS. IT WOULD EXPAND THE HOME SAFE PROGRAM. SO THAT MORE COUNTIES COULD PARTICIPATE IN FOR THAT THE COUNTIES THAT ARE PARTICIPATING CAN GO DEEPER INTO THEIR NEED- AND IT WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING FOR COUNTIES TO PARTICIPATE AND- MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS LIKE FINANCIAL BE SPECIALIST TEAMS. WHERE APS AGING SERVICE SAYS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY LAW ENFORCEMENT OTHER NONPROFIT- FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDERS WERE COLLABORATIVELY TO INTERVENE ON FEET FINANCIAL ABUSE CASES. AND THAT THE GOAL OF THIS EXPANSION IN THE INSPIRATION OF THIS EXPANSION WAS THE RESEARCH BY DR TO SHELVE THAT HALF OF THE OLDER ADULTS ON THE STREET RIGHT NOW ARE OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY. AND HALF OF THEM GOT AFTER THE AGE OF FIFTY THEY DIDN'T GET THERE BECAUSE OF A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS THEY GOT THERE BECAUSE OF A LIFE EVENT- OR POVERTY OR RENT INCREASE AT THAT PREVENTED THEM FROM BEING ABLE. TO CONTINUE TO REMAIN HOUSE SAFELY LIKE LIKE THE PERCENT ON THE EXTREME DESCRIBED. SO AND PRIVATE SHE GOT TOUCH ON THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE GET TO THAT CENTER FIFTY MILLION THING- SO. YOU AYE CHANNEL THIS THROUGH A PS AND THE REASON FOR BECAUSE WHAT YOU DESCRIBE THIS OKAY YES SOMEONE IS AT RISK FOR HOMELESSNESS AND- WITH A NEED HELP AND YOU KNOW THEY NEED SOME HELP FOR THE REST SO. AB AND SECURE IS TO. WHY THROUGH A TS VERSUS SOME OTHER MECHANISM RIGHT NOW ALL THIS MONEY RIGHT NOW YOU CREATED A P. S. TO BE THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR STATE WIDE RESPONSE TO ABUSE AND NEGLECT- AND YOU CREATED HOME SAFE WITHIN THE APS PROGRAM. TO SUPPORT. OUR EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ABUSED AND NEGLECTED WE BELIEVE THAT. BY BEING ABLE TO FURTHER ASSIST PEOPLE WHO COME WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF THE PROGRAM THE YOU ALREADY CREATED WE CAN SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE FUNDED. OUT OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FUND WE DEFINITELY SEE THIS IS COMPLEMENTARY. BUT THOSE ARE COMPETITIVELY PROCURED THERE BASED ON WEEKENDS SOME ENTITIES WILL PARTICIPATE AND SOME WON'T. WHERE'S THE PS PROGRAM IS THE STATEWIDE MANDATED RESPONSE TO USE GLASS. AND IT'S BASED ON THE RESEARCH THAT IDENTIFIES THOSE PEOPLE OPPORTUNE. HIGH RISK THAT WE THINK THAT. WITH WITH WHAT IS IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS A PRETTY MODEST ANNUAL INVESTMENT WE CAN START TO CHIP AWAY AT THAT GROUP THOSE PEOPLE OVER FIFTY. FOR THE FASTEST GROWING GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE STREET- AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAP AND START TO BEND THE CURVE ON THAT. WHILE OTHER HOMELESSNESS SERVICES PROVIDERS WERE FUNDED THROUGH KEEP IT HAPPENED THE NEW FIND THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED CONTINUE TO DO THINGS- LIKE DO BOOT TO STAND UP NAVIGATION CENTERS ARE TOO LONG TERM RENTAL SUBSIDY PROGRAMS- AND THE OTHER VARIOUS GREAT THINGS THAT COULD BE FUNDED. OUT OF THAT FOR. SO IT'S AS IF THIRTY AND HERE YOU SEE EIGHT. ADULT EIGHT SIXTY SIXTY FIVE WHO. ARE WHO IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE APS DUDE. HOW DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT ROUGHLY. THE STATE. ELIZA REALLY WE DON'T HAVE AN S. TO OF THE OF PEOPLE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY COME TO OUR ATTENTION. BUT I THINK THAT THE ESTIMATE THAT WE HAVE IN THE WE CAN BE SURE BACK UP WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF. IS A TO BE ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL VICTIMS OF ELDER ABUSE AND NEGLECT. THAT COULD BE ASSISTED WITH THE AUGMENTATION WERE HAPPY TO SHARE THAT YOU GOT YOUR YOUR YOUR OLD PROJECTING YEAH YEAH I THIS FUND WOULD ESSENTIALLY ASSIST ABOUT THREE HUNDRED. THIRTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL PEOPLE WITH THE CASE MANAGEMENT AND SAFE AND HOME SAFE AND THEN THE OTHER PART IS THIS. BEST PRACTICES CENTER THAT'S DIFFERENT OKAY. ALL RIGHT OKAY SAYING ALL RIGHT NOW THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS THAN NATIONS ALL RIGHT. NOW HOME SAFE IS JUST STARTING RATE SO WE WORST SO WE'RE STILL WAITING TO GET SOME REST IT'S FOR THAT BY ARE YOU TALK ABOUT ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE READY THAT SAN FRANCISCO SAID AND WE'RE IS EAGER TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND YOU SEE A FAST SAYS ANYONE TO GET THAT EVALUATION INFORMATION OKAY BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE FIVE MILLION PER YEAR FOR THREE YEARS RIGHT ON I'M SELF HOME SAFE SO WE ARE LOOKING AT 25% FROM FIVE TO TWENTY FIVE IT ALSO I MEAN THE GOVERNOR'S ALSO PROPOSED A BIT HARD TO ACTUALLY TO TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY ASSUME YOU'RE NOT SAYING THAT. TO TAKE AWAY THE FIVE SO WRECKED. THE GONNA SAY THAT THAT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED A- A ROOT CAUSES STUDY- THAT WE THINK THIS COMPLEMENTS AS WELL AND WE REALLY DO NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IMMEDIATELY BEFORE. SOMEONE GOES FROM ONE HOUSE STE- YEAH. FROM HOUSE TO ON HOUSED IN AND WHAT COULD ANY OF US TO. TO HAVE PREVENTED THAT AND FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS HOW COME WE QUICKLY- BEFORE THE D. COMPENSATING THAT OCCURS. GET PEOPLE RE HOUSE AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF HOME SAFE ALSO ELUCIDATE. AND COMPLEMENT THAT RESEARCH. OKAY I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT APPROACH BECAUSE I THINK IN. MY VIEW AYE THIS IS THAT. WHEN SOMEONE BECOMES HOMELESS I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S A- CRITICAL EVENTS RATE I MEAN- TERMITE PEOPLE I DON'T THINK PEOPLE. END UP HOMELESS BECAUSE THEY HAVE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS RIGHT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT. NOT SAY THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DON'T HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IS THAT WHEN THEY BECOME HOMELESS THOSE GET COMMENDED EXACERBATED AND THEN YOU GO LOW AT ALL THE- HOLD THIS. TO SEE A THE AS WELL. ACTUALLY IT'S- TO HELP US. BECAUSE I KNOW HOW SHE FOR AND SAME WITH A ISSUE AND TYPES THINGS. KEEP FOR HOW. THE IS THAN TRYING TO REACH SOME WHAT THEY'RE READY ON STATE AND- BASIC. THE SPECIAL THAT AND EVERYTHING ELSE THE UNSTATED. BECAUSE THERE WAS SO. I DO APPRECIATE. AND TRUST PART YES WANT. IT JUST AT THE ONE OF THE THINGS WE SEE A LOT OF IS THE MAIN. AND SO WORSE A CAR AND IN IN THE FORM OF DEMENTIA WERE SEEN. CERTAINLY THE NEED FOR LAW TERM CASE. AND UP. SO WILL. VERY SPECIAL SIR. SO SING HOME PEOPLE IMMERSING ON PEOPLE WHO HAVE THAT CONTENT HAVE IMPAIRMENT WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME SO THEM. MUCH OF THIS PROPOSAL IS AROUND LIKE- LENGTHENING THE TIME THAT WE HAVE AS WITH APS WORKERS TO SPEND. WITH PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEED HELP TO TRANSITION. EITHER INTO HOUSING OR AT LEAST IN. OF STABLE. SUCH XIN. ALL RIGHT. OKAY ALL RIGHT THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SO IT'S MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT ON A PROTECTIVE SERVICES WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON LISA COLEMAN WITH CALCUTTA WHILE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SOUNDS LIKE AN ASTRONOMICAL AMOUNT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT WITH THE NUMBER OF CASES OF SELF NEGLECT IF WE DON'T ACT MORE PRO ACTIVELY THOSE OLDER ADULTS ARE GOING TO ULTIMATELY GOING TO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WHICH WILL BE A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER COST YOU SAID IT BEFORE SENATOR PAN WE PAY FOR THESE THINGS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. YOU PAID FOR THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM BECAUSE BETTER TO DO AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION AND A POUND OF CURE YES. I QUICKLY. ANOTHER A- OF YOUR PREVENTION THE FAST TEAMS ARE AMAZING OMBUDSMAN SPEAK VERY HIGHLY OF THEM BUT THEY ARE NOT CONSISTENT ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS SUPPORTED WITH PAID STAFF AND THEIR COMPLEX TO GET. ALL THE PARTIES TO THE TABLE BUT WHEN WE GET ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTIES TO THE TABLE THE FAST PROGRAMS ARE FANTASTIC. AT PREVENTING THE HEMORRHAGE OF FINANCIAL LOSS LOU IF WE COULD STOP SOME OF THE FINANCIAL ABUSE WE COULD HAVE OLDER ADULTS PAYING FOR THEIR OWN LONG TERM CARE INSTEAD OF THE STATE HAVING TO PICK UP THE DIED BECAUSE- THAT THE PREVENTION IT'S JUST TOO LATE WHEN THE MONEY IS ALREADY GONE TO.
