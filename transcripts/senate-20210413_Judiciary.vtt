WE NOW HAVE ACCESS WHAT THIS

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:12.485
BILL DOES IS ADD A FEW OTHER

00:09:12.551 --> 00:09:15.254
CATEGORIES AND THE PRINCIPLE OF

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:17.857
WHICH IS THAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:19.592
TO BE EFFECTIVE MUST HAVE THE

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:21.260
TRUST OF THE COMMUNITY IT

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:22.929
SERVES AND WHEN THE COMMUNITY

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:25.798
FEELS LIKE WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:27.767
ABOUT OUR OFFICERS AND IF WE

00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:29.235
MAKE CERTAIN COMPLAINTS WE HAVE

00:09:29.302 --> 00:09:31.871
NO IDEA IF THOSE COMPLAINTS ARE

00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:34.073
EVER INVESTIGATED WORK THE

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.675
OFFICERS EVER HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:37.910
SO THE ADDITION THAT I WILL BE

00:09:37.977 --> 00:09:40.346
PRESENTED TO NOW ARE ADDITIONS

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.815
THAT MOST PEOPLE FEEL ARE VERY

00:09:42.882 --> 00:09:45.217
READ THING THAT ALL OF US

00:09:45.284 --> 00:09:47.086
DESERVED KNOW ABOUT THE OFFICER

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:50.690
THAT SIR. SO THE ADDITIONAL

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:55.328
RECORDS THERE ARE SIX DAD'S ARE

00:09:55.394 --> 00:09:57.563
GETTING SPEAKING ACCESS TO USE

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:58.764
FORCE SOME OF THE WE WOULD BE

00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.866
ABLE TO GET A WORK ON SO.

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:09.475
FINDING OF HENRI- USE OF FORCE.

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:12.178
IT ALSO PROVIDES IF NORTH

00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:14.146
OFFICER HAS A HIS OF. BIASED OR

00:10:14.213 --> 00:10:17.016
DISK. ACTS AND AGAIN SYSTEM. WE

00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:19.385
WOULD HAVE TO THOSE. THAT IF

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:20.486
THEY HAD A HISTORY OF CONDUCT A

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:25.224
LOS ARREST SEARCH. AND- IN

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:28.394
ANOTHER COUNTY OF DISHONESTY.

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.262
SO ALL OF THESE MUST BE

00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:34.734
SUSTAINED FINDINGS- THE LAST

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.137
THING THAT THE BILL DOES. IS IT

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:42.608
ENSURES THAT. IF AN OFFICER

00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:44.210
QUITS THEIR JOB LET'S SAY

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:45.745
THERE'S A SET OF COMPLAINTS

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:47.279
BROUGHT AGAINST THEM AND THE

00:10:47.346 --> 00:10:49.715
AGENCY HAS JUST OPENED AN

00:10:49.782 --> 00:10:50.316
INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN

00:10:50.383 --> 00:10:52.151
COMPLETED AND THE OFFICER

00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:55.755
CHOOSES TO AVOID. HAVING THE

00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:58.057
COMPLETE LOOKED INTO TO LEAVE

00:10:58.124 --> 00:11:01.594
THE JOB. THAT A NOTHER HIRING

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.363
AGENCY BEEN CONSIDERING THE

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.332
HIRING OF THAT OFFICER CAN CAN

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:08.734
AND WOULD REQUEST FROM THE

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:10.870
PREVIOUS AGENCY ALL RECORDS

00:11:10.936 --> 00:11:13.439
RELATED TO THAT OFFICER. SO WE

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:14.807
DON'T HAVE A SITUATION WHERE

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:16.909
OFFICERS ARE JUST QUITTING IT

00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:18.711
JUMPING OFF TO ANOTHER FORCE TO

00:11:18.778 --> 00:11:21.247
AVOID HAVING THEIR MISCONDUCT

00:11:21.313 --> 00:11:24.050
EVER REVEALED. SO THIS PROTECTS

00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:26.152
ALL OF US IT PROTECTS OUR

00:11:26.218 --> 00:11:28.988
AGENCIES SO THAT THEY KNOW WHO

00:11:29.055 --> 00:11:31.123
THEY'RE HIRING. SO THAT'S WHAT

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.625
THE BILL DOES SPOKE SKEWS ME

00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:34.160
THERE'S ONE OTHER COMPONENT AND

00:11:34.226 --> 00:11:36.729
THAT IS ONCE FOURTEEN TWENTY

00:11:36.796 --> 00:11:38.330
ONE PASSED MOST JURISDICTIONS

00:11:38.397 --> 00:11:39.832
AND AGENCIES COMPLIED WITH THE

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:41.867
LAW IN RELEASED THE RECORDS AS

00:11:41.934 --> 00:11:44.870
THE BILL WRECKED. IT IN FORCE-

00:11:44.937 --> 00:11:46.739
REQUIRED. HOWEVER THERE ARE

00:11:46.806 --> 00:11:50.176
SOME AGENCIES WHO WANTED TO

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:52.912
HEAR DIRECTOR FEED FOR DOOR OR

00:11:52.978 --> 00:11:54.647
CREATE OBSTACLES AND SOME OF

00:11:54.713 --> 00:11:56.649
THE OBSTACLES THAT THEY CREATED

00:11:56.715 --> 00:12:00.553
WERE TO CHARGE OUT REGIS PRICES

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:02.054
FOR THE REQUEST FOR TO GET

00:12:02.121 --> 00:12:04.323
RECORDS. THERE WAS ONE

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:04.890
PARTICULAR JURISDICTION IT

00:12:04.957 --> 00:12:07.426
TRIED TO CHARGE A FAMILY SOME

00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:09.762
AT THAT THE INITIAL BILL WAS

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:11.030
THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE

00:12:11.097 --> 00:12:11.697
REAP RECORDS THAT THEY

00:12:11.764 --> 00:12:13.532
REQUESTED. SO WHAT THIS BILL

00:12:13.599 --> 00:12:15.301
DOES IS CLARIFY THEY CAN ONLY

00:12:15.367 --> 00:12:17.269
CHARGE FOR THE COPYING JUST

00:12:17.336 --> 00:12:17.837
LIKE OUR PUBLIC RECORDS ACT

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:20.239
REQUIRES. AND THAT THEY MUST

00:12:20.306 --> 00:12:22.875
RESPOND IN A TIMELY MANNER AND

00:12:22.942 --> 00:12:23.843
IF THEY DO NOT RESPOND IN A

00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:25.244
TIMELY MANNER THERE'S THE

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:27.012
ABILITY TO TAKE TO CHALLENGE

00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:29.715
THAT IN COURT AND FOR THERE TO

00:12:29.782 --> 00:12:31.917
BE FEES OR FINES LEVIED. BOB

00:12:31.984 --> 00:12:33.652
BASED ON THEIR REFUSAL TO

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.222

I HAVE BEEN HAVING SAID THAT-

01:41:11.765 --> 01:41:13.467
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO AS THE

01:41:13.534 --> 01:41:15.903
AUTHOR KNOWS TRYING TO DO-

01:41:15.969 --> 01:41:19.840
SOME- SEQUEL REFORM AROUND THE

01:41:19.907 --> 01:41:21.675
OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD AFFORDABLE

01:41:21.742 --> 01:41:24.411
HOUSING AND IN PARTICULAR IN-

01:41:24.478 --> 01:41:25.412
VERY POOR NEIGHBORHOODS AND I

01:41:25.479 --> 01:41:26.814
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IT MOSTLY

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:29.249
BECAUSE- THE L. A. DELEGATION

01:41:29.316 --> 01:41:31.885
AND IN THE ASSEMBLY. DOESN'T

01:41:31.952 --> 01:41:35.122
LIKE SYKORA STREAMLINING OR OR

01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:38.959
OR OR- THE EXPEDITED JUDICIAL

01:41:39.026 --> 01:41:41.695
REVIEW- GIVEN THAT THIS IS FOR

01:41:41.762 --> 01:41:42.996
L. A. AND MY GUESS IS THEY'LL

01:41:43.063 --> 01:41:44.398
TAKE A VERY DIFFERENT VIEW OF

01:41:44.465 --> 01:41:46.300
IT IN AND OUT THERE WILL BE A

01:41:46.366 --> 01:41:47.468
PROBLEM BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY

01:41:47.534 --> 01:41:51.004
THAT THAT- I THINK THAT. THIS

01:41:51.071 --> 01:41:53.540
IS A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE

01:41:53.607 --> 01:41:56.043
KIND OF THE SEQUOIA-

01:41:56.109 --> 01:41:57.544
MODIFICATION THAT WE NEED TO

01:41:57.611 --> 01:42:00.447
CONSIDER- I ON A BROADER BASIS

01:42:00.514 --> 01:42:02.683
WHAT CAN BE BETTER FOR THE

01:42:02.749 --> 01:42:04.084
ENVIRONMENT THAN FOR US TO GET

01:42:04.151 --> 01:42:05.385
PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR VEHICLES

01:42:05.452 --> 01:42:05.986
<u>ND TAKING PUBLIC</u>

01:42:06.053 --> 01:42:08.822
TRANSPORTATION. AND TO DO IT IN

01:42:08.889 --> 01:42:11.058
OUR URBAN CENTERS IS EXACTLY

01:42:11.124 --> 01:42:13.026
WHERE IT SHOULD BE DONE. AND SO

01:42:13.093 --> 01:42:14.862
IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT WE HAD

01:42:14.928 --> 01:42:17.731
A WE HAD A LOOK AT THIS- AND

01:42:17.798 --> 01:42:18.966
INSTEAD OF AN EXPEDITED

01:42:19.032 --> 01:42:20.534
JUDICIAL REVIEW WE SHOULD LOOK

01:42:20.601 --> 01:42:22.102
AT IT AS AN ARM AND AN

01:42:22.169 --> 01:42:24.271
EXPEDITED JUDICIAL- EXPEDITED

COVERT RELATED POLICY. IN MY

02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:44.715
OPINION THIS IS A

02:28:44.782 --> 02:28:47.551
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE THAT WE'RE

DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE FIRST

02:29:00.665 --> 02:29:04.368

02:29:25.823 --> 02:29:27.925
AMENDMENT CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE.

02:29:27.992 --> 02:29:30.394

CHURCH GOER MY NINETY ONE YEAR

02:30:18.242 --> 02:30:20.611
OLD FATHERS A CHURCH GOER. AND

02:30:20.678 --> 02:30:21.846
HE I DON'T THINK EVER REALLY

02:30:21.912 --> 02:30:23.447
MISSED A DAY OF CHURCH OR

02:30:23.514 --> 02:30:25.783
SUNDAY IN HIS LIFE. BUT WHEN

02:30:25.850 --> 02:30:28.285
THIS PANDEMIC HAPPENED GIVEN

02:30:28.352 --> 02:30:30.588
HIS- MEDICAL CONDITIONS IN

02:30:30.654 --> 02:30:32.757
UNDERLYING SITUATIONS. I DIDN'T

02:30:32.823 --> 02:30:34.125
FEEL COMFORTABLE TAKING A TRIP

02:30:34.191 --> 02:30:36.160
TAKEN TO CHURCH AND I MYSELF

02:30:36.227 --> 02:30:38.329
DIDN'T GO TO CHURCH. FOR A

02:30:38.396 --> 02:30:40.164
EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME AND I'M

02:30:40.231 --> 02:30:42.466
AN AVID TO CONGREGATE AT SAINT

02:30:42.533 --> 02:30:44.135
GEORGE GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH IN

02:30:44.201 --> 02:30:46.670
FRESNO CALIFORNIA. BUT I

02:30:46.737 --> 02:30:48.005
BELIEVE IN SCIENCE AND I

02:30:48.072 --> 02:30:49.874
BELIEVE IN DOUBT AND I BELIEVE

02:30:49.940 --> 02:30:52.410
ON LEARNING FROM EXPERTS. I WAS

02:30:52.476 --> 02:30:54.412
A PROFESSOR FOR OVER A DECADE

02:30:54.478 --> 02:30:55.479
NINE I HOLD THOSE INDIVIDUALS

02:30:55.546 --> 02:30:57.481
THAT ARE SUFFICIENTLY SCHOOLED

02:30:57.548 --> 02:30:59.717
AND EDUCATED IN RESPECTIVE

02:30:59.784 --> 02:31:01.852
DISCIPLINES THAT THEY TELL ME.

02:31:01.919 --> 02:31:02.720
THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN

02:31:02.787 --> 02:31:05.423
ACTIVITIES YOU SHOULD AVOID OR

02:31:05.489 --> 02:31:07.691
AT LEAST UNDERTAKE TO MITIGATE

02:31:07.758 --> 02:31:08.259
THE RISKS THAT ALL LISTEN TO

02:31:08.325 --> 02:31:11.128
THEM. SO I DID NOT GO TO CHURCH

02:31:11.195 --> 02:31:14.031
FOR A WHILE. AND I BELIEVE THAT

02:31:14.098 --> 02:31:16.000
WAS THE RIGHT COURSE OF ACTION.

02:31:16.066 --> 02:31:18.335
BUT THEN SOMETHING CHANGED WE

02:31:18.402 --> 02:31:20.938
BECAME BETTER AWARE OF WHAT THE

02:31:21.005 --> 02:31:24.041
PATHOLOGY OF THE VIRUS ONCE. IN

02:31:24.108 --> 02:31:26.377
HOW WE COULD STILL PARTICIPATE

02:31:26.444 --> 02:31:29.346
ON A LIMITED BASIS. WHETHER IT

02:31:29.413 --> 02:31:30.648
BE GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE

02:31:30.714 --> 02:31:33.083
TO HOME DEPOT OR- INTERACTING

02:31:33.150 --> 02:31:35.853
WITH OTHER FOLKS. SO WHEN

02:31:35.920 --> 02:31:37.521
CERTAIN RULES WERE PUT FORWARD

02:31:37.588 --> 02:31:40.925
THAT DISALLOWED. CONGREGANTS

02:31:40.991 --> 02:31:43.194
FROM ASSEMBLING ON CHURCH

02:31:43.260 --> 02:31:46.464
GROUNDS. I WOULD ASK MYSELF

02:31:46.530 --> 02:31:48.332
WHAT IS MY CHURCH DOING TO

02:31:48.399 --> 02:31:50.267
PROTECT THESE INDIVIDUALS

02:31:50.334 --> 02:31:52.036
BECAUSE CAT COUNTY LAW AND

02:31:52.102 --> 02:31:53.537
STATE LAW WE'RE DISALLOWING

02:31:53.604 --> 02:31:55.539
CERTAIN ACTIVITIES. BUT I

02:31:55.606 --> 02:31:57.775
DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THERE WAS

02:31:57.842 --> 02:31:59.810
SUFFICIENT SOCIAL DISTANCING

02:31:59.877 --> 02:32:02.513
THAT IT WAS OUTSIDE. AND ALL

02:32:02.580 --> 02:32:04.682
THE RELEVANT PROTECTIONS AND

02:32:04.748 --> 02:32:07.985
PROTOCOLS ARE PUT INTO PLACE.

02:32:08.052 --> 02:32:10.688
YET INDIVIDUALS AND MOSQUES

02:32:10.754 --> 02:32:12.223
TEMPLES AND CHURCHES WERE NOT

02:32:12.289 --> 02:32:14.058
ALLOWED FOR- TO BE OPEN FOR

02:32:14.124 --> 02:32:17.728
BUSINESS. THAT'S WHY BRING UP

02:32:17.795 --> 02:32:19.830
THIS ISSUE OF. THE

02:32:19.897 --> 02:32:22.600
CONSTITUTIONALITY. OF WHAT

02:32:22.666 --> 02:32:26.103
OCCURRED AND WHY THIS IS NOT A

02:32:26.170 --> 02:32:27.271
PARTISAN ISSUE INSIDE A

02:32:27.338 --> 02:32:30.608
RELIGIOUS ISSUE. IF WE BELIEVE

02:32:30.674 --> 02:32:31.108
THAT WE HAVE A RIGHT TO

02:32:31.175 --> 02:32:34.245
ASSEMBLE. THEN WE NEED TO MAKE

02:32:34.311 --> 02:32:35.513
CERTAIN THAT WE FIGHT FOR THAT

02:32:35.579 --> 02:32:38.382
RIGHT ON THE SOLE CONDITION.

02:32:38.449 --> 02:32:41.018
THAT WE ARE ABIDING BY THE

02:32:41.085 --> 02:32:43.621
PREVAILING HEALTH PROTOCOLS. SO

02:32:43.687 --> 02:32:46.824
AS A MATTER OF EQUAL PROTECTION

02:32:46.891 --> 02:32:47.424
THE QUESTION THAT WE MUST ASK

02:32:47.491 --> 02:32:50.861
OURSELVES. WERE THESE CHURCHES

02:32:50.928 --> 02:32:52.997
FOR THESE MOSQUES OR THE

02:32:53.063 --> 02:32:56.233
SYNAGOGUES. PRACTICING THE

02:32:56.300 --> 02:32:58.235
PREVAILING HEALTH DIRECTIVES OF

02:32:58.302 --> 02:33:00.371
THE STATE THE CDC OR THE LOCAL

02:33:00.437 --> 02:33:02.206
AUTHORITIES IF THE ANSWER WAS

02:33:02.273 --> 02:33:05.242
YES. BUT I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE

02:33:05.309 --> 02:33:09.313
A RIGHT TO ATTEND. UNDER THOSE

02:33:09.380 --> 02:33:12.550
LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. SO I

02:33:12.616 --> 02:33:15.886
THINK THIS BILL TALKS ABOUT.

02:33:15.953 --> 02:33:20.090
WHETHER GOING TO CHURCH OR

02:33:20.157 --> 02:33:22.126
MOSQUE OR TEMPLE IS AN

02:33:22.192 --> 02:33:25.262
ESSENTIAL ACTIVITY. I ASK

02:33:25.329 --> 02:33:30.734
MYSELF IF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.

02:33:30.801 --> 02:33:33.037
ARE CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL IN

02:33:33.103 --> 02:33:35.573
AMERICA THAN BEING ABLE TO

02:33:35.639 --> 02:33:37.875
ATTEND THESE ACTIVITIES ON THE

02:33:37.942 --> 02:33:39.710
SOLE CONDITION BUT THEY ARE

02:33:39.777 --> 02:33:41.712
ABIDING BY THE PREVAILING

02:33:41.779 --> 02:33:44.448
HEALTH DIRECTIVES. THAT THAT IS

02:33:44.515 --> 02:33:46.216
A CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED

02:33:46.283 --> 02:33:49.019
ESSENTIAL ACTIVITIES. I'M NOT

02:33:49.086 --> 02:33:49.954
SURE HOW YOU CAN GET AROUND

02:33:50.020 --> 02:33:51.755
THAT I WANNA BE VERY CLEAR MY

02:33:51.822 --> 02:33:55.192
COLLEAGUES. I DID NOT SEND MY

02:33:55.259 --> 02:33:56.594
FATHER TO CHURCH BECAUSE I

02:33:56.660 --> 02:33:58.729
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE VIRUS. I

02:33:58.796 --> 02:34:01.098
DID NOT SEND MY FATHER CHURCH

02:34:01.165 --> 02:34:02.700
FOR MY FAMILY IF THERE WERE

02:34:02.766 --> 02:34:04.735
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THERE WAS

02:34:04.802 --> 02:34:06.036
NO SOCIAL DISTANCING THERE'S NO

02:34:06.103 --> 02:34:07.738
MASK WEARING AND THERE'S IT

02:34:07.805 --> 02:34:09.607
WASN'T OUTDOORS BUT ON THE

02:34:09.673 --> 02:34:11.375
CONDITION THAT IT WAS. IT WAS

02:34:11.442 --> 02:34:14.278
CONSISTENT. WITH THOSE

02:34:14.345 --> 02:34:16.380
PREVAILING AUTHORITY DIRECTORS

02:34:16.447 --> 02:34:17.915
I COULD NOT SEE A DIFFERENCE

02:34:17.982 --> 02:34:19.583
BETWEEN GOING TO HOME DEPOT.

02:34:19.650 --> 02:34:23.153
AND GOING TO CHURCH. AND THAT I

02:34:23.220 --> 02:34:23.821
THINK IS WHAT THIS ISSUE IS

02:34:23.887 --> 02:34:25.823
ABOUT TODAY. IS THAT IF WE

02:34:25.889 --> 02:34:27.691
BELIEVE THAT CONSTITUTIONAL

02:34:27.758 --> 02:34:30.527
RIGHTS OF RELIGION AND ASSEMBLY

02:34:30.594 --> 02:34:32.196
IN THE EQUAL APPLICATION. OF

02:34:32.262 --> 02:34:36.100
THE LAW. WE MUST FIND OURSELVES

02:34:36.166 --> 02:34:39.903
IN THE LEGAL DIRECTION THAT IT

02:34:39.970 --> 02:34:41.839
THAT THAT GOING TO CHURCH OR

02:34:41.905 --> 02:34:44.274
MOSQUE OR TEMPLE. IS A

02:34:44.341 --> 02:34:45.476
CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED

02:34:45.542 --> 02:34:48.479
ACTIVITY. THAT'S WHY COLLEAGUES

02:34:48.545 --> 02:34:51.048
AT ASK YOU. MAKE CERTAIN YOU

02:34:51.115 --> 02:34:52.449
DON'T GET SEDUCED BY THE

02:34:52.516 --> 02:34:54.151
PARTISAN NATURE OF HOW THIS

02:34:54.218 --> 02:34:57.688
ISSUE HAS ARISEN IN THE MEDIA.

02:34:57.755 --> 02:34:58.756
THIS IS A CONSTITUTIONAL

02:34:58.822 --> 02:35:01.258
QUESTION NOT A THEOLOGICAL

02:35:01.325 --> 02:35:07.598
QUESTION. THANK YOU SIR

02:35:07.665 --> 02:35:08.966

CHAIRMAN. I COMPLETELY AGREE.

02:35:17.408 --> 02:35:21.211
WITH MY COLLEAGUE. THAT THIS IS

02:35:21.278 --> 02:35:24.081
ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION. THIS

02:35:24.148 --> 02:35:24.581
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

02:35:24.648 --> 02:35:27.484
PARTISANSHIP IT HAS TO DO WITH

02:35:27.551 --> 02:35:31.021
THE SAKE RIGHTS. ENUMERATED THE

02:35:31.088 --> 02:35:32.756
FIRST AMENDMENT OF THE UNITED

02:35:32.823 --> 02:35:34.958
STATES CONSTITUTION. CONGRESS

02:35:35.025 --> 02:35:37.661

OR RELIGION NO QUESTION ABOUT

02:35:40.931 --> 02:35:46.737
IT. BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY HOW

02:35:46.804 --> 02:35:47.237
THE CONSTITUTION'S BEEN

02:35:47.304 --> 02:35:51.408
INTERPRETED. SIMPLE EXAMPLES

02:35:51.475 --> 02:35:52.910
JUSTICE HOME SAID YOU CAN'T

02:35:52.976 --> 02:35:54.845
YELL FIRE IN A CROWDED THEATER

02:35:54.912 --> 02:35:56.447
WE HAVE RIGHT FREE SPEECH.

02:35:56.513 --> 02:35:57.614
DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO SAY FREE

02:35:57.681 --> 02:36:00.217
SPEECH HE'LL FIRED A CREDITOR

02:36:00.284 --> 02:36:00.818
NO BECAUSE IT CREATES A CLEAR

02:36:00.884 --> 02:36:02.386
AND PRESENT DANGER. TO TEST

02:36:02.453 --> 02:36:03.687
WHETHER IT'S RELIGION OR

02:36:03.754 --> 02:36:09.693
ASSEMBLY. OR OUR- SPEECH. IS

02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:14.431
BALANCED BY AND POLICE POWER AS

02:36:14.498 --> 02:36:16.834
WE TRY TO CREATE A WORKABLE

02:36:16.900 --> 02:36:19.103
GOVERNMENT. WE WANT TO MAKE

02:36:19.169 --> 02:36:21.171
SURE THAT THESE RIGHTS ARE HELD

02:36:21.238 --> 02:36:23.874
IN THE HIGHEST. SACRED NATURE

02:36:23.941 --> 02:36:25.309
OF WHICH THEY ARE INFORMED AND

02:36:25.375 --> 02:36:27.177
OUR CONSTITUTION BUT THERE IS

02:36:27.244 --> 02:36:29.646
ALSO A BALANCE. SO NOW YOU HAVE

02:36:29.713 --> 02:36:32.082
AN EXECUTIVE FACED WITH AN

02:36:32.149 --> 02:36:33.684
EXTRAORDINARY EMERGENCY. THE

02:36:33.751 --> 02:36:35.319
QUESTION IS OF COURSE UNDER

02:36:35.385 --> 02:36:36.687
CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES THEY

02:36:36.754 --> 02:36:38.055
HAVE TO EXERCISE STRICT

02:36:38.122 --> 02:36:40.257
SCRUTINY IN THAT REGARD. NO

02:36:40.324 --> 02:36:43.427
QUESTION BUT A STRICT READING

02:36:43.494 --> 02:36:45.429
OF WHAT WAS ARTICULATED HERE

02:36:45.496 --> 02:36:46.530
AND WHAT'S ARTICULATED THIS

02:36:46.597 --> 02:36:48.565
BILL IS THAT WERE BASICALLY

02:36:48.632 --> 02:36:50.134
TURNING OVER THE POLICE POWERS

02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:51.802
DETERMINATION OF WHAT SHOULD

02:36:51.869 --> 02:36:53.170
AND SHOULDN'T DO TO THE COURTS

02:36:53.237 --> 02:36:55.005
WERE ELIMINATING EXECUTIVES

02:36:55.072 --> 02:36:56.673
IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT THEIR

02:36:56.740 --> 02:36:57.641
POWER IS TO MAKE THOSE

02:36:57.708 --> 02:36:59.276
DETERMINATIONS OF ALL OF US

02:36:59.343 --> 02:36:59.877
SAID THERE'S AN OUTBREAK OF

02:36:59.943 --> 02:37:02.679
LEPROSY. IF THERE'S A SHOOTER

02:37:02.746 --> 02:37:04.248
THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT IT

02:37:04.314 --> 02:37:05.449
HAPPENS TO HAVE A CHURCH AND WE

02:37:05.516 --> 02:37:07.551
WANT TO IMPOSE A CURFEW BECAUSE

02:37:07.618 --> 02:37:09.486
WE WANT TO PROTECT. PEOPLE FROM

02:37:09.553 --> 02:37:11.288
GETTING SHOT AND THEY SAY WELL

02:37:11.355 --> 02:37:12.356
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A

02:37:12.422 --> 02:37:13.590
RELIGIOUS OR I WANT TO BE ABLE

02:37:13.657 --> 02:37:15.359
TO ASSEMBLE IN WHATEVER MY

02:37:15.425 --> 02:37:16.393
ORGANIZATIONS COULD BE THE

02:37:16.460 --> 02:37:18.295
QANTAS CLUB I'M SORRY THE

02:37:18.362 --> 02:37:21.498
GOVERNMENT HAS A POLICE POWER.

02:37:21.565 --> 02:37:23.834
TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND IF

02:37:23.901 --> 02:37:26.403
YOU IF YOU ANALYZE THE CASES I

02:37:26.470 --> 02:37:29.306
HAVE READ IN. ATTENDED VERSES

02:37:29.373 --> 02:37:31.408
NEWSOME IT CAME DOWN APRIL

02:37:31.475 --> 02:37:33.510
NINTH I THINK THAT THE GUIDANCE

02:37:33.577 --> 02:37:35.846
BASICALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS

02:37:35.913 --> 02:37:37.047
ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS IT SEEMS

02:37:37.114 --> 02:37:38.949
TO ME IN READING THIS CASE. IS

02:37:39.016 --> 02:37:41.118
THAT IT'S REALLY A FACT BASED

02:37:41.185 --> 02:37:44.054
CASE THAT THE EXECUTIVE RDER

02:37:44.121 --> 02:37:45.589
SHOULD HAVE MORE CLEARLY

02:37:45.656 --> 02:37:47.124
ARTICULATE GIVEN THE FACT THAT

02:37:47.191 --> 02:37:48.625
THIS RELATES TO FUNDAMENTAL

02:37:48.692 --> 02:37:49.827
RIGHTS OF ASSEMBLY OR

02:37:49.893 --> 02:37:51.662
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF RELIGION.

02:37:51.728 --> 02:37:52.696
IT SHOULD HAVE MORE CLEARLY

02:37:52.763 --> 02:37:54.431
ARTICULATED THIS BUT IN ESSENCE

02:37:54.498 --> 02:37:58.202
WHAT JUSTICE. KAGAN SAYS JOIN

02:37:58.268 --> 02:38:00.137
WITH. R. J. BRYER JUST TO SORT

02:38:00.204 --> 02:38:02.639
OF MY ORDER. SHE TALKS ABOUT

02:38:02.706 --> 02:38:03.640
YOU KNOW WHETHER THERE'S A RISK

02:38:03.707 --> 02:38:05.409
OR NOT. IN IN LOOKING AT THE

02:38:05.475 --> 02:38:06.910
COURT AND THEY MAKE THREE

02:38:06.977 --> 02:38:08.612
POINTS FIRST WHEN PEOPLE GATHER

02:38:08.679 --> 02:38:09.847
IN SOCIAL SETTINGS THE

02:38:09.913 --> 02:38:11.281
INTERACTIONS ARE LIKELY TO BE

02:38:11.348 --> 02:38:12.716
LONGER. THAN THEY WOULD BE IN A

02:38:12.783 --> 02:38:13.984
COMMERCIAL SETTING AND LOOKING

02:38:14.051 --> 02:38:15.152
AT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN

02:38:15.219 --> 02:38:16.854
TAPPING THE COMMERCIAL CONTEXT.

02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:19.289
PERSON ASSEMBLY WHETHER IT'S

02:38:19.356 --> 02:38:20.424
RELIGIOUS OTHERWISE SECONDLY.

02:38:20.490 --> 02:38:21.859
RIVA HOUSE ARE TYPICALLY

02:38:21.925 --> 02:38:23.460
SMALLER AND LESS VENTILATED.

02:38:23.527 --> 02:38:24.795
THAN COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENT

02:38:24.862 --> 02:38:26.263
THIRD SOCIAL DISTRICTS AGAIN

02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:28.031
MASS WEARING ARE LESS LIKELY IN

02:38:28.098 --> 02:38:29.666
PRIVATE SETTINGS IN ENFORCEMENT

02:38:29.733 --> 02:38:31.335
IS MORE DIFFICULT. IN OTHER

02:38:31.401 --> 02:38:32.469
<u>ORDS SHE TOOK THIS THE</u>

02:38:32.536 --> 02:38:34.004
NECESSARY STEPS TO DO THE

02:38:34.071 --> 02:38:36.039
DIAGNOSTIC IN THAT REGARD. BUT

02:38:36.106 --> 02:38:38.141
THE PRINCIPLES REMAIN THE SAME.

02:38:38.208 --> 02:38:41.144
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO RUN A

02:38:41.211 --> 02:38:43.447
GOVERNMENT. IF YOU STIFF IF

02:38:43.513 --> 02:38:44.681
YOU'RE TERM PROTECTION OF THE

02:38:44.748 --> 02:38:47.384
CONSTITUTION. AS SET FORTH IN

02:38:47.451 --> 02:38:49.519
THIS MEASURE WAS SO STRICT.

02:38:49.586 --> 02:38:51.421
THAT IT LITERALLY NO MATTER

02:38:51.488 --> 02:38:52.522
WHAT HAPPENED YOU'D BE TO

02:38:52.589 --> 02:38:54.458
FEARFUL. THAT YOU COULD NOT

02:38:54.524 --> 02:38:57.060
ENGAGE THE POLICE POWER TO DEAL

02:38:57.127 --> 02:38:59.596
WITH. WHATEVER THE ISSUE WAS

02:38:59.663 --> 02:39:01.131
BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO WORRIED THAT

02:39:01.198 --> 02:39:02.599
THE STRICT INTERPRETATION OF

02:39:02.666 --> 02:39:03.967
THE LAWS WRITTEN WOULD

02:39:04.034 --> 02:39:05.836
ELIMINATE YOUR ABILITY DO SO.

02:39:05.903 --> 02:39:07.638
SO YES THESE ARE SACRED RIGHTS

02:39:07.704 --> 02:39:09.406
BUT THEIR BALANCE FOR ALL OF US

02:39:09.473 --> 02:39:10.540
IN SOCIETY BECAUSE WE LIVE

02:39:10.607 --> 02:39:12.009
TOGETHER WE WORK TOGETHER WE

02:39:12.075 --> 02:39:14.511
LIVE IN TH SAME COMMUNITIES.

02:39:14.578 --> 02:39:16.613
TO BE ABLE TO WORK TO MAKE IT.

02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:18.048
UNDERSTANDABLE IN A WORKABLE

02:39:18.115 --> 02:39:20.217
WAY THIS IS A GLOBAL PANDEMIC

02:39:20.284 --> 02:39:22.686
THAT AFFECTED ALL ELEMENTS. OF

02:39:22.753 --> 02:39:23.887
THE YOU THAT YOU SEE THAT

02:39:23.954 --> 02:39:25.722
STATES BUT THE GLOBE. AND SO

02:39:25.789 --> 02:39:28.525
THAT REGARD. I THINK THAT- THAT

02:39:28.592 --> 02:39:30.894
THIS MEASURE YES- PROPERLY

02:39:30.961 --> 02:39:31.862

02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:35.666
DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION. AND

02:39:35.732 --> 02:39:40.237
WOULD NOT SUPPORT THIS MEASURE.

FINAL THOUGHTS BEFORE WE VOTE

NOW FIRST AS WE KNOW THE U. S.

02:40:54.711 --> 02:40:56.046
SUPREME COURT HAD TO INTERVENE

02:40:56.113 --> 02:40:58.548
TWICE. IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS

02:40:58.615 --> 02:41:00.317
WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S. WHEN THE

02:41:00.384 --> 02:41:01.318
GOVERNOR SOUGHT TO COMPLETELY

02:41:01.385 --> 02:41:02.753
SHUT DOWN HOUSES OF WORSHIP THE

02:41:02.819 --> 02:41:04.421
SUPREME COURT RULED THAT WHILE

02:41:04.488 --> 02:41:06.156
THE GOVERNOR CAN IMPOSE.

02:41:06.223 --> 02:41:07.758
REASONABLE SAFETY RESTRICTIONS

02:41:07.824 --> 02:41:10.827
AND LIMITS. I GOVERNOR CANNOT

02:41:10.894 --> 02:41:12.796

SYNAGOGUES. EVEN THE DISSENTERS

02:41:17.734 --> 02:41:19.236
IN THESE DECISIONS BELIEVE THAT

02:41:19.302 --> 02:41:21.505
THE GOVERNOR CANNOT ARBITRARILY

02:41:21.571 --> 02:41:24.374
TREAT RELIGION DIFFERENTLY THAN

02:41:24.441 --> 02:41:26.510
SIMILAR SECULAR ACTIVITIES. AS

02:41:26.576 --> 02:41:28.678
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR WAS QUOTED

02:41:28.745 --> 02:41:30.514

EQUALLY AS STRICT. END QUOTE.

02:41:42.426 --> 02:41:44.694

PRIVATE RELIGIOUS GATHERINGS MY

02:41:53.236 --> 02:41:54.471

CHILDREN ADDRESSING THE COURT

PARTIES UNLESS IT MAKES A

03:33:36.336 --> 03:33:37.771
DETERMINATION THAT THAT WOULD

03:33:37.838 --> 03:33:39.306
BE IN THE CHILD'S BEST INTEREST

03:33:39.373 --> 03:33:40.607
THAT CURRENTLY THE COURTS HAVE

03:33:40.674 --> 03:33:42.876
DISCRETION IT. TOO I'LL HELP

03:33:42.943 --> 03:33:45.279
ALLOW IN CAMERA TESTIMONY- BUT

03:33:45.345 --> 03:33:46.880
MANY OF THEM DECIDE NOT TO DO

03:33:46.947 --> 03:33:48.415
AND SO THEY HAVE TO FIND MAKE A

03:33:48.482 --> 03:33:51.018
FINDING IT THAT'S APPROPRIATE-

03:33:51.084 --> 03:33:53.220
AND I CAN BE VERY STRESSFUL AND

03:33:53.287 --> 03:33:54.988
TRAUMATIC FOR CHILDREN. HAVING

03:33:55.055 --> 03:33:56.256
TO TESTIFY IN FRONT OF THEIR

03:33:56.323 --> 03:33:58.225
PARENTS AS TO WHICH PARENT THEY

03:33:58.292 --> 03:34:00.127
WANT TO HAVE CUSTODY OBVIOUSLY

03:34:00.194 --> 03:34:01.762
THAT CAN BE A DIFFICULT THING

03:34:01.828 --> 03:34:04.731
IT CAN BE TRAUMATIZING- AND A

03:34:04.798 --> 03:34:05.832
NUMBER OF FOLKS BELIEVE THEY

03:34:05.899 --> 03:34:08.168
CAN CREATE LONG TERM EMOTIONAL

03:34:08.235 --> 03:34:10.370
DISTRESS AND HARM. OFTENTIMES

03:34:10.437 --> 03:34:12.439
FOR EXAMPLE CHILDREN WILL AGREE

03:34:12.506 --> 03:34:14.308
TO TESTIFY IN FRONT OF A JUDGE

03:34:14.374 --> 03:34:15.375
NOT KNOWING THAT THIS CAN

03:34:15.442 --> 03:34:17.377
ENTAIL STATING THEIR CUSTODY

03:34:17.444 --> 03:34:18.278
PREFERENCES IN FRONT OF THEIR

03:34:18.345 --> 03:34:20.214
PARENTS. HI THIS CAN SPLIT FOR

03:34:20.280 --> 03:34:21.381
FAMILIES AND I WAS JUST TALKING

03:34:21.448 --> 03:34:24.451
TO- SOMEBODY IN THIS BODY.

03:34:24.518 --> 03:34:25.919
ABOUT THIS AND THEY ARE

03:34:25.986 --> 03:34:26.853
EXPRESSING TO ME THAT THIS IS

03:34:26.920 --> 03:34:28.488
VERY TRAUMATIZING IT DOES

03:34:28.555 --> 03:34:30.657
SPLINTER FAMILIES- AND SO I

03:34:30.724 --> 03:34:32.893
THINK JEWELERS TESTIMONY CAN BE

03:34:32.960 --> 03:34:34.127
VERY IMPORTANT IN THESE TYPES

03:34:34.194 --> 03:34:37.130
OF SITUATIONS BUT- THEY SHOULD

03:34:37.197 --> 03:34:39.866
BE- OUR EMPHASIS SHOULD BE ON

03:34:39.933 --> 03:34:40.434
MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE IN

03:34:40.500 --> 03:34:42.836
SAFE ENVIRONMENTS- AND SO WHAT

03:34:42.903 --> 03:34:43.704
THE FIRST COMPONENT THIS BILL

03:34:43.770 --> 03:34:46.340
DOES. IS A SAID IS TO HAVE

03:34:46.406 --> 03:34:48.642
JUDGES- IT GENERALLY REQUIRES

03:34:48.709 --> 03:34:50.477
THE JUDGES- CREATING

03:34:50.544 --> 03:34:53.113
ALTERNATIVE TO TESTIFYING IN

03:34:53.180 --> 03:34:54.848
FRONT OF THEIR PARENTS- WHETHER

03:34:54.915 --> 03:34:56.483
THAT'S IN CAMERA TESTIMONY OR

03:34:56.550 --> 03:34:59.019
OR SOME OTHER OPTION. AND

03:34:59.086 --> 03:35:01.054
GENERALLY ONLY ALLOWS JUDGES TO

03:35:01.121 --> 03:35:02.456
FORCE CHILDREN TO TESTIFYING

03:35:02.522 --> 03:35:03.991
FROM THEIR PARENTS IN THESE

03:35:04.057 --> 03:35:05.859
MATTERS WHEN THEY DEEM THIS TO

03:35:05.926 --> 03:35:12.766
BE IMPORTANT NECESSARY. AND

03:35:12.833 --> 03:35:13.300
BENEFICIAL FOR THE CHILD'S

03:35:13.367 --> 03:35:13.867
EMOTIONAL HEALTH. THE SECOND

03:35:13.934 --> 03:35:14.501
THING THAT AS SIXTY FOUR IS THE

03:35:14.568 --> 03:35:16.203
IT TAKES EXIST SAFETY MEASURES.

03:35:16.270 --> 03:35:17.904
THAT ARE USED FOR CHILD CUSTODY

03:35:17.971 --> 03:35:20.240
DETERMINATIONS AND EXTENDS AND

03:35:20.307 --> 03:35:22.109
UNSUPERVISED VISITATIONS-

03:35:22.175 --> 03:35:23.477
CURRENTLY JUDGES MUST CONSIDER

03:35:23.543 --> 03:35:25.612
A HISTORY OF ABUSE. OR DRUG

03:35:25.679 --> 03:35:27.681
ADDICTION WHEN PLACING CHILDREN

03:35:27.748 --> 03:35:29.716
IN THE CUSTODY OF INDIVIDUALS-

03:35:29.783 --> 03:35:32.753
AND SO IF A JUDGE DOES DECIDE

03:35:32.819 --> 03:35:34.354
TO PLACE A CHILD IN THE CUSTODY

03:35:34.421 --> 03:35:36.223
OF INDIVIDUALS. WITH ANY OF

03:35:36.290 --> 03:35:37.557
THESE- TRIGGERS IN THEIR

03:35:37.624 --> 03:35:38.925
BACKGROUNDS THE JUDGE MUST

03:35:38.992 --> 03:35:40.794
CREATE A WRITTEN FINDING ON WHY

03:35:40.861 --> 03:35:42.963
THAT IS THE CASE- AND THAT

03:35:43.030 --> 03:35:44.264
ENSURES THAT RECORDS OF THESE

03:35:44.331 --> 03:35:46.199
TERMINATIONS ARE CAPPED. THIS

03:35:46.266 --> 03:35:48.335
CAN HELP SAVE LIVES IT HELPS-

03:35:48.402 --> 03:35:50.537
AS FAR AS DETERMINING CUSTODY-

03:35:50.604 --> 03:35:51.672
BUT UNFORTUNATELY RIGHT NOW THE

03:35:51.738 --> 03:35:53.774
SAME REQUIREMENT DOES NOT APPLY

03:35:53.840 --> 03:35:56.943
