00:33:55.933 --> 00:33:58.503

THE LEGISLATURE WORK THAT OTHER

THAT LA HAS DONE. AND REALLY

00:34:06.444 --> 00:34:08.079
LOOK AT THESE ISSUES AND TRY

00:34:08.146 --> 00:34:10.715
TO. LOOK AT THINGS OVER A LONG

00:34:10.782 --> 00:34:12.784
PERIOD OF TIME RATHER THAN ONE

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:14.318
PARTICULAR STANDALONE AUDIT AND

00:34:14.385 --> 00:34:17.422
THEN WE'RE DONE. SO IN IN

00:34:17.488 --> 00:34:18.823
TWENTY THIRTEEN SEPTEMBER OF

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:20.024
TWENTY THIRTEEN WEEK WAS THE

00:34:20.091 --> 00:34:21.626
FIRST. POINT IN TIME WHERE WE

00:34:21.692 --> 00:34:23.861
IDENTIFIED IT SECURITY AS A

00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:26.030
HIGH RISK ISSUE. THIS WAS BASED

00:34:26.097 --> 00:34:27.432
ON AUDIT WORK THAT WE HAD DONE

00:34:27.498 --> 00:34:28.699
ON A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

00:34:28.766 --> 00:34:30.034
PROJECTS THE LEGISLATURE ASKED

00:34:30.101 --> 00:34:31.936
US TO DO. BUT AGAIN IT WAS

00:34:32.003 --> 00:34:33.237
SPOTTY IT WAS AN AUDIT OF THE

00:34:33.304 --> 00:34:34.872
P. YOU SEE IT WAS AN AUDIT OF

00:34:34.939 --> 00:34:37.875
THE AT THAT TIME THE A OC. AND

00:34:37.942 --> 00:34:39.177
ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THOSE

00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:40.645
AUDITS WAS LOOKING AT

00:34:40.711 --> 00:34:42.113
PROTECTION OF DATA AND I. T.

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:43.815
SECURITY. SO WE DECIDED BASED

00:34:43.881 --> 00:34:46.150
ON AN ADVICE FROM MY STAFF.

00:34:46.217 --> 00:34:46.918
LET'S LOOK AT THIS MORE

00:34:46.984 --> 00:34:48.886
GLOBALLY FROM A MORE GLOBAL

00:34:48.953 --> 00:34:50.154
PERSPECTIVE AS TO WHAT IS THE

00:34:50.221 --> 00:34:52.123
STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOING.

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:53.191
ACROSS THE BOARD FOR ALL OUR

00:34:53.257 --> 00:34:55.827
STATE AGENCIES. TO ENSURE THAT.

00:34:55.893 --> 00:34:58.262
DATA IS BEING PROTECTED TO THE

00:34:58.329 --> 00:35:00.264
EXTENT WE POSSIBLY CAN PROTECT

00:35:00.331 --> 00:35:01.999
IT SO. WE PUT IT ON THE HIGH

00:35:02.066 --> 00:35:03.868
RISK LIST IN SEPTEMBER OF

00:35:03.935 --> 00:35:05.503
TWENTY THIRTEEN. THEN WE DID AN

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:06.370
AUDIT IN ALL AT THAT WE

00:35:06.437 --> 00:35:08.306
RELEASED IN AUGUST OF TWENTY

00:35:08.372 --> 00:35:09.874
FIFTEEN. AND THIS WAS

00:35:09.941 --> 00:35:11.976
SPECIFICALLY AN AUDIT OF

00:35:12.043 --> 00:35:13.511
ENTITIES THAT WERE UNDER THE

00:35:13.578 --> 00:35:15.346
GOVERNOR'S PURVIEW. UNDER THE

00:35:15.413 --> 00:35:16.280
DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES

00:35:16.347 --> 00:35:17.482
PURVIEW AS FAR AS AN AND

00:35:17.548 --> 00:35:19.684
OVERSIGHT ENTITY. AND IN THAT

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:22.153
AUDIT WE SURVEYED AGENCIES AND

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.521
THEN WE DID A DRILL DOWN AT

00:35:23.588 --> 00:35:25.690
FIVE PARTICULAR ENTITIES WE

00:35:25.756 --> 00:35:26.724
DON'T DISCLOSE THE NAMES OF THE

00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:29.293
ENTITIES IN THE REPORT. BACK IN

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:29.894
TWENTY FIFTEEN AND YOU'LL SEE

00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:31.929
IN THE REPORT. THAT YOU LOOK AT

00:35:31.996 --> 00:35:33.264

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:34.899
NAMES OF THE ENTITIES TO

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:37.034
PROTECT. BECAUSE THERE ARE

00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:38.436
VULNERABILITIES IN THERE ARE

00:35:38.503 --> 00:35:39.871
WEAKNESSES AND WE DON'T WANT TO

00:35:39.937 --> 00:35:42.874
DISCLOSE THAT. TO THE PUBLIC OR

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:43.774
ANYONE THAT WANTS TO

00:35:43.841 --> 00:35:44.742
POTENTIALLY HACK INTO THE

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:47.311
SYSTEMS. SO BACK IN AUGUST OF

00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:48.446
TWENTY FIFTEEN WE CONDUCTED THE

00:35:48.513 --> 00:35:49.347
WORK WE SURVEYED A BUNCH OF

00:35:49.413 --> 00:35:51.349
AGENCIES ASK THEM ABOUT THEIR

00:35:51.415 --> 00:35:52.149
POLICIES PROCEDURES WHAT

00:35:52.216 --> 00:35:55.286

THREE HUNDRED STANDARDS WHICH

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:02.860
ARE STANDARDS THAT THE STATE OF

00:36:02.927 --> 00:36:03.761
CALIFORNIA ESTABLISHED. THAT

00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:06.664
MIRROR NATIONAL STANDARDS. THAT

00:36:06.731 --> 00:36:08.065
REALLY DO PUT TOGETHER A

00:36:08.132 --> 00:36:10.001
FRAMEWORK FOR PROTECTING DATA

00:36:10.067 --> 00:36:12.603
WHAT WE FOUND IN THAT AUDIT IS.

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.138
SEVENTY SEVEN OF THE AGENCIES I

00:36:14.205 --> 00:36:14.805
THINK WE SURVEYED A LITTLE OVER

00:36:14.872 --> 00:36:17.041
A HUNDRED AGENCY SAID. A

00:36:17.108 --> 00:36:18.142
SEVENTY THREE OUT OF SEVENTY

00:36:18.209 --> 00:36:19.744

00:36:21.512 --> 00:36:23.281
NOT COMPLIANT. WITH THERE ARE

00:36:23.347 --> 00:36:25.983
WEAKNESSES IN OUR SYSTEMS. SO

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:27.051
WHEN WE WENT TO THE FIVE

00:36:27.118 --> 00:36:28.953
ENTITIES AND DRILL DOWN. AND

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.354
REALLY TOOK A HARDER LOOK AT

WELL WHY ARE YOU NOT COMPLIANT

00:36:31.689 --> 00:36:33.424
WILL PART OF THE REASON IS. WE

00:36:33.491 --> 00:36:34.725
DON'T UNDERSTAND THE STANDARDS

00:36:34.792 --> 00:36:36.460
WE NEED ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE WE

00:36:36.527 --> 00:36:37.662
NEED SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE

00:36:37.728 --> 00:36:38.596
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

TECHNOLOGY. CALIFORNIA'S

00:36:40.031 --> 00:36:42.233
EXPERTS ARE IN WHAT THE

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.401
STANDARDS ARE AND WHAT KINDS OF

00:36:43.467 --> 00:36:44.802
PROTECTIONS. THEY NEEDED

00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:46.537
ASSISTANCE IN CONDUCTING RISK

00:36:46.604 --> 00:36:48.039
MANAGEMENT DETERMINING WHAT ARE

00:36:48.105 --> 00:36:49.941
THE HIGHEST RISK. ISSUES THAT

00:36:50.007 --> 00:36:52.610
WE NEED TO ADDRESS FIRST SO

00:36:52.677 --> 00:36:53.578
THAT WAS AN ISSUE THAT WE

00:36:53.644 --> 00:36:56.247
IDENTIFIED ALSO. THERE IS

EVEN THOUGH THOSE AGENCIES WERE

00:37:03.321 --> 00:37:05.256
SELF ASSERTING TO TECHNOLOGY.

00:37:05.323 --> 00:37:07.658
THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM THERE

00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:09.694

00:37:30.581 --> 00:37:31.682
AUTHORED A BILL AT THAT TIME

00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:33.551
AND THAT BILL. MADE IT TO THE

00:37:33.618 --> 00:37:35.186
GOVERNOR'S DESK AND THAT WAS A

00:37:35.252 --> 00:37:37.588
BILL THAT REQUIRED AGENCIES

00:37:37.655 --> 00:37:38.889
THIRTY FIVE A YEAR. TO HAVE A

00:37:38.956 --> 00:37:40.891
SECURITY ASSESSMENT THAT WAS A

00:37:40.958 --> 00:37:42.159
HUGE STEP IN THE RIGHT

00:37:42.226 --> 00:37:44.428
DIRECTION AS FAR AS MANDATING.

00:37:44.495 --> 00:37:46.297
THIS KIND OF ASSESSMENT AND

00:37:46.364 --> 00:37:47.798
OVERSIGHT FOR AGENCIES TO

00:37:47.865 --> 00:37:49.066
REALLY PURSUE IT BECAUSE WE SAW

00:37:49.133 --> 00:37:50.801
A MIX OF. AGENCIES IN

00:37:50.868 --> 00:37:52.436
DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THEY

00:37:52.503 --> 00:37:55.206
WERE GOING TO DO AN ASSESSMENT

00:37:55.272 --> 00:37:55.940
HOW COMPREHENSIVE WAS THE

00:37:56.007 --> 00:38:01.078
ASSESSMENT. SO THERE. HAVE BEEN

00:38:01.145 --> 00:38:01.646
STEPS AS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:38:01.712 --> 00:38:02.313
IRWIN INDICATED. THAT THERE HAS

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:02.947
BEEN IMPROVEMENT AND LOOKING AT

00:38:03.014 --> 00:38:03.681
THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE

00:38:03.748 --> 00:38:04.348
MADE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:38:04.415 --> 00:38:05.683
TECHNOLOGY BACK IN TWENTY

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:07.118
FIFTEEN. THEY HAVE FULLY

00:38:07.184 --> 00:38:08.419
IMPLEMENTED ALL THOSE

00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:09.654
RECOMMENDATIONS PROVIDING

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.122
GUIDANCE HAVING WORKSHOPS

00:38:11.188 --> 00:38:12.456
LOOKING AT THE STANDARDS

00:38:12.523 --> 00:38:14.425
GETTING FEEDBACK FROM. THEIR

00:38:14.492 --> 00:38:16.360
CONSTITUENTS STATE AGENCIES SO

00:38:16.427 --> 00:38:18.129
WE SAW IMPROVEMENT AT THERE

00:38:18.195 --> 00:38:20.197
STILL IS WORK TO BE DONE. BUT

00:38:20.264 --> 00:38:22.199
IT HAS GOTTEN BETTER SO OUR

00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:23.634
CONCLUSION FROM THAT IS

00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:25.670
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVERSIGHT

00:38:25.736 --> 00:38:26.804
FROM THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE

00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:27.705
HAS HELPED THE STATE OF

00:38:27.772 --> 00:38:29.907
CALIFORNIA. GET INTO A BETTER

00:38:29.974 --> 00:38:31.409
POSITION AND PROTECTING DATA

00:38:31.475 --> 00:38:33.110
BUT THERE WAS A MISSING LINK.

00:38:33.177 --> 00:38:34.712
IT WAS THESE ENTITIES THAT ARE

00:38:34.779 --> 00:38:36.580
NOT UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE

00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:37.882
EXECUTIVE BRANCH UNDER THE

00:38:37.948 --> 00:38:39.850
GOVERNOR. AND MANY OF THOSE

00:38:39.917 --> 00:38:40.951
ENTITIES WE MEANT WE DON'T

00:38:41.018 --> 00:38:42.687
SPECIFY BUT IT'S DO YOU

00:38:42.753 --> 00:38:44.255
JUDICIAL BRANCH ENTITIES

00:38:44.321 --> 00:38:46.157
CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS. OTHER

00:38:46.223 --> 00:38:48.259
ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT UNDER THE

00:38:48.325 --> 00:38:49.427
GOVERNOR'S PURVIEW SO WE

00:38:49.493 --> 00:38:52.296
DECIDED THIS LAST YEAR WE NEED

00:38:52.363 --> 00:38:52.997
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE

00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:54.165
AGENCIES AND DO SOMETHING

00:38:54.231 --> 00:38:56.200
COMPARABLE. TO WHAT WE DID BACK

00:38:56.267 --> 00:38:58.202
IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO REALLY SEE

00:38:58.269 --> 00:38:59.370
WHAT IS THE FRAMEWORK LOOKING

00:38:59.437 --> 00:39:01.439
LIKE WHAT'S THE WHAT ARE THESE

00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:02.506
DIFFERENT ENTITIES DOING

00:39:02.573 --> 00:39:04.208
CONSTITUTIONAL THAN OTHERS. AS

00:39:04.275 --> 00:39:05.976
FAR AS MAKING SURE THEY ADOPT

00:39:06.043 --> 00:39:08.079
STANDARDS THEY'RE FOLLOWING

00:39:08.145 --> 00:39:09.580
THOSE STANDARDS THEY'RE GETTING

00:39:09.647 --> 00:39:10.948
THOSE ASSESSMENTS DONE THEY'RE

00:39:11.015 --> 00:39:12.550
IDENTIFYING THEIR WEAKNESSES.

00:39:12.616 --> 00:39:14.985
AND HOPEFULLY MITIGATING AND

00:39:15.052 --> 00:39:15.486
CAR ARE CORRECTING THOSE

00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:17.121
WEAKNESS WEAKNESSES TO TIGHTEN

00:39:17.188 --> 00:39:19.290
UP. THE CONTROLS OVER THOSE THE

00:39:19.356 --> 00:39:22.293
DATA THAT THEY HAVE. IN HOUSE

00:39:22.359 --> 00:39:24.695
SO WITH THAT MEMBERS ALTERNATE

00:39:24.762 --> 00:39:25.930
OVER TO MISTER WARD WE HAVE

00:39:25.996 --> 00:39:27.965
HANDED OUT THE REPORTS VERY

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:30.367
SHORT. THERE'S A FEW TABLES IN

00:39:30.434 --> 00:39:31.936
THE REPORT I BELIEVE MISTER

00:39:32.002 --> 00:39:33.204
WHAT'S GONNA STEP YOU THROUGH

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:34.071
TO REALLY ILLUSTRATE WHAT WE

00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:34.605
IDENTIFIED THIS PARTICULAR

00:39:34.672 --> 00:39:36.407
REPORT. VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE

00:39:36.474 --> 00:39:38.008
IDENTIFIED BACK IN TWENTY

00:39:38.075 --> 00:39:39.276
FIFTEEN FOR STATE AGENCIES WE

00:39:39.343 --> 00:39:41.378
DO HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS

00:39:41.445 --> 00:39:42.246
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:39:42.313 --> 00:39:44.081
CONTEMPLATE. WHERE WE THINK

00:39:44.148 --> 00:39:47.885
THERE CAN BE REPORTING. TO THE-

00:39:47.952 --> 00:39:50.488
PRIVACY COMMITTEE AS FAR AS THE

00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:51.856
ASSESSMENTS THAT THESE ENTITIES

00:39:51.922 --> 00:39:55.292
ARE DOING SO THAT THERE IS

00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:56.026
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT IT

00:39:56.093 --> 00:39:56.594
PROTECTS THE INDEPENDENCE OF

00:39:56.660 --> 00:40:00.731
THE CONSTITUTION. ELS ADDRESSES

00:40:00.798 --> 00:40:01.665
THAT CONCERN BUT ALSO PROVIDES

00:40:01.732 --> 00:40:02.266
ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT FOR THESE

00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:02.767
ENTITIES SO THAT WE CAN

00:40:02.833 --> 00:40:04.802
STRENGTHEN THEIR CONTROLS OVER

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:07.938
INFORMATIONS INFORMATION AND

00:40:08.005 --> 00:40:08.572
DATA THAT THEY COLLECT SO OFTEN

00:40:08.639 --> 00:40:09.140
I'LL HAND IT OVER TO MISTER

00:40:09.206 --> 00:40:11.575
WARD. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER

00:40:11.642 --> 00:40:13.144

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:14.445
COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD MY

00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:15.746
NAME IS BEN WARD I WAS THE

00:40:15.813 --> 00:40:17.148
AUDIT PRINCIPLE ON THIS

00:40:17.214 --> 00:40:19.216
ASSIGNMENT. AND AS MS HOUSE

00:40:19.283 --> 00:40:21.952
SAID THIS AUDIT FOCUSED ON

00:40:22.019 --> 00:40:24.054
ENTITIES THAT WERE OUTSIDE THE

00:40:24.121 --> 00:40:24.855
PURVIEW OF DEPARTMENT

00:40:24.922 --> 00:40:26.690
TECHNOLOGY FOR THE PURPOSES OF

00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:27.958
THE AUDIT. WE CALL THOSE NON

00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:30.094
REPORTING ENTITIES AND AMONG

00:40:30.161 --> 00:40:32.096
OTHER THINGS WHAT THAT MEANS IS

00:40:32.163 --> 00:40:35.166
THEY DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW THE-

00:40:35.232 --> 00:40:37.234
STATE STANDARDS FOR INFORMATION

00:40:37.301 --> 00:40:38.469
SECURITY THERE ARE MAINTAINED

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:40.504
BY DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY. SO

00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:43.674
AGAIN UNDERSTANDING OF. WHAT

00:40:43.741 --> 00:40:44.875
STANDARDS THEY WERE FOLLOWING

00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:46.744
AND WHAT STEPS THE NON

00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:48.379
REPORTING AGENCIES WERE TAKING

00:40:48.445 --> 00:40:49.280
TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAD

00:40:49.346 --> 00:40:51.248
EFFECTIVE. I'M SECURITY

00:40:51.315 --> 00:40:51.816
PRACTICES WE SURVEYED THIRTY

00:40:51.882 --> 00:40:55.152
THREE ENTITIES. AND TWENTY NINE

00:40:55.219 --> 00:40:57.221
RESPONDED SAYING THAT THEY HAD

00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:58.689
BASED THEIR SECURITY POLICIES

00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:00.791
AND PROCEDURES OFF OF INDUSTRY

00:41:00.858 --> 00:41:02.393
STANDARDS AND THAT THEY HAD

00:41:02.459 --> 00:41:04.328
ALSO DONE AN ASSESSMENT

00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:05.729
MEASURING THEMSELVES AGAINST

00:41:05.796 --> 00:41:07.565
THOSE STANDARDS. AND IF YOU

00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:10.167
TURN TO PAGE TEN OF THE REPORT.

00:41:10.234 --> 00:41:13.037
YOU CAN SEE THAT TWENTY FOUR OF

00:41:13.103 --> 00:41:15.105
THOSE ENTITIES RESPONDED THAT

00:41:15.172 --> 00:41:16.340
THEY WERE ONLY PARTIALLY

00:41:16.407 --> 00:41:19.310
COMPLIANCE. WITH THE STANDARDS

00:41:19.376 --> 00:41:21.212
AND TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF SOME

00:41:21.278 --> 00:41:22.780
OF THE AREASOF NON COMPLIANCE

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:23.647
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE

00:41:23.714 --> 00:41:25.716
FOUND DURING ASSESSMENTS WE

00:41:25.783 --> 00:41:26.684
HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE EXAMPLES IN

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:28.385
THE REPORT ONE ENTITY FOR

00:41:28.452 --> 00:41:32.223
EXAMPLE. DIDN'T CHANGE THE

00:41:32.289 --> 00:41:34.892
DEFAULT PASSWORDS ON CERTAIN I.

00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:38.229
T. DEVICES WHICH- RAISES THE

00:41:38.295 --> 00:41:39.096
REST THAT SOMEBODY THAT KNOWS

00:41:39.163 --> 00:41:40.497
THE FALL PASSWORDS CAN

00:41:40.564 --> 00:41:41.866
INTERPRET REAL ACCESS THOSE

00:41:41.932 --> 00:41:43.868
DEVICES ANOTHER EXAMPLE WE

00:41:43.934 --> 00:41:45.736
HIGHLIGHT IN THE REPORT IS AN

00:41:45.803 --> 00:41:48.339
ENTITY WASN'T REGULARLY

00:41:48.405 --> 00:41:50.040
APPLYING SECURITY UPDATES

00:41:50.107 --> 00:41:50.774
MEANING THAT KNOWN

00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:52.610
VULNERABILITIES PERSISTED IN

00:41:52.676 --> 00:41:54.245
THE SYSTEM INCREASING THE RISK

00:41:54.311 --> 00:41:55.579
THAT THOSE VULNERABILITIES

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:57.114
COULD BE EXPLOITED. SO THOSE

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:59.016
ARE SOME OF THE NON FINDINGS

00:41:59.083 --> 00:42:00.317
THAT RIGHT AND IF I DURING

00:42:00.384 --> 00:42:02.553
THESE ASSESSMENTS WE ALSO NOTE

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.588
THAT FOR ENTITIES HAD DONE AN

00:42:04.655 --> 00:42:06.590
ASSESSMENT SO IT'S LIKELY THEY

00:42:06.657 --> 00:42:08.525
HAVE WEAKNESSES THAT THEY'RE

00:42:08.592 --> 00:42:10.060
JUST UNAWARE OF BECAUSE THEY

00:42:10.127 --> 00:42:11.161
HAVEN'T DONE THE WORK TO

00:42:11.228 --> 00:42:12.062
MEASURE THEMSELVES AGAINST

00:42:12.129 --> 00:42:14.932
THOSE INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES.

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:15.566
THAT ARE THAT ARE DOCUMENTED IN

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:18.702
THE STANDARDS. HOWEVER WE ALSO

00:42:18.769 --> 00:42:20.671
NOTED THAT SOME OF THE ENTITIES

00:42:20.738 --> 00:42:22.806
THAT WERE AWARE OF DEFICIENCIES

00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:24.842
WEREN'T TAKING ADEQUATE STEPS

00:42:24.909 --> 00:42:25.776
TO FOLLOW UP ON THOSE

00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:28.279
DEFICIENCIES. FOR EXAMPLE ONE

00:42:28.345 --> 00:42:29.446
ENTITY A WORK WITH THE

00:42:29.513 --> 00:42:31.615
DEPARTMENT MILITARY AND DONE AN

00:42:31.682 --> 00:42:32.082
INDEPENDENT SECURITY

00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:34.818
ASSESSMENT. AND THE DEPARTMENT

00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:36.854
MILITARY PROVIDED A REPORT

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:38.422
IDENTIFIED THE FIVE AREAS OF

00:42:38.489 --> 00:42:40.057
THE GREATEST RISK TO THAT

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:42.826
ENTITY. AND THE SIXTEEN MONTHS

00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:44.561
AFTER THIS ESTIMATE WE FOLLOWED

00:42:44.628 --> 00:42:46.764
UP WITH THAT ENTITY AND THEY

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:49.833
HAD YET TO FULLYRESOLVE ANY OF

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.835
THOSE FIVE AREAS. IN FACT THEY

00:42:51.902 --> 00:42:54.071
HAD NOT IDENTIFIED THE FULL

00:42:54.138 --> 00:42:55.439
SCOPE OF WORK THEY NEED TO BE

00:42:55.506 --> 00:42:57.908
DONE. THE TIME LINE FOR YOU FOR

00:42:57.975 --> 00:42:59.910
DOING THAT WORK OR THE STAFFING

00:42:59.977 --> 00:43:02.179
RESOURCES NEEDED TO FOR TO

00:43:02.246 --> 00:43:04.481
FULLY RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES.

00:43:04.548 --> 00:43:05.950
ANOTHER EXAMPLE WAS AN ENTITY

00:43:06.016 --> 00:43:07.351
THAT HAD DEFICIENCIES DATING

00:43:07.418 --> 00:43:09.954
BACK TO TWENTY THIRTEEN. AND

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.288
WHEN WE FOLLOWED UP WITH THAT

00:43:11.355 --> 00:43:12.890
ENTITY TO DETERMINE WHAT HOW

00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:14.792
ARE YOU TRACKING. THESE

00:43:14.858 --> 00:43:16.226
DEFICIENCIES THERE ONLY ABLE TO

00:43:16.293 --> 00:43:17.895
PROVIDE US WITH POWER POINT

00:43:17.962 --> 00:43:18.462
PRESENTATIONS THAT STAFF HAD

00:43:18.529 --> 00:43:21.932
PROVIDED. TO THEIR I. T.

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:23.133
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HOWEVER

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.668
THESE PRESENTATIONS WERE

00:43:24.735 --> 00:43:26.537
MISSING KEY DETAILS SUCH AS

00:43:26.603 --> 00:43:27.871
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR FIXING

00:43:27.938 --> 00:43:29.873
THE PROBLEM. WHAT'S THE FULL

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:30.674
SCOPE OF WORK THAT THEY'RE

00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:32.209
GOING TO DO TO FIX THAT PROBLEM

00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:33.744
AND WHAT'S THE TIMELINE IN THE

00:43:33.811 --> 00:43:35.479
TIME LINES IMPORTANT BECAUSE

00:43:35.546 --> 00:43:37.681
SOME OF THESE ARE A TO SIX

00:43:37.748 --> 00:43:38.182
YEARS OLD AND STILL NOT

00:43:38.248 --> 00:43:43.687
RESOLVED. SO WE REALLY WERE

00:43:43.754 --> 00:43:44.621
CONCERNED THAT NOT EVERYBODY

00:43:44.688 --> 00:43:46.323
WAS ASSESSING THEMSELVES AND

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:47.691
THAT THERE ARE EVEN PEOPLE THAT

00:43:47.758 --> 00:43:49.526
WERE HAD DEFICIENCIES THAT.

00:43:49.593 --> 00:43:52.229
THAT WERE REMAINING OUTSTANDING.

00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:53.998
BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT WE

00:43:54.064 --> 00:43:56.967
THINK THERE'S OTHER LORD WE

00:43:57.034 --> 00:43:58.502
BELIEVE THERE'S OTHER

00:43:58.569 --> 00:44:00.504
DEFICIENCIES THAT AGENCIES ARE

00:44:00.571 --> 00:44:01.972
JUST UNAWARE OF AND IF YOU TURN

00:44:02.039 --> 00:44:05.509
TO PAGE THIRTEEN. YOU CAN SEE

00:44:05.576 --> 00:44:06.076
THAT WE FOLLOWED UP WITH TEN

00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:09.913
ENTITIES IN DETAIL. IN NINE OF

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.348
THE ENTITY SAID THAT THEY

00:44:11.415 --> 00:44:13.751
FOLLOWED INDUSTRY STANDARDS

00:44:13.817 --> 00:44:15.185
VERY COMMON LIKE EITHER THE

00:44:15.252 --> 00:44:16.653
STATE STANDARDS THE FEDERAL

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.955
STANDARDS OR AN INTERNATIONAL

00:44:18.022 --> 00:44:19.890
STANDARDS WE FOUND ALL THE

00:44:19.957 --> 00:44:21.291
STANDARD TO BE VERY COMPARABLE

00:44:21.358 --> 00:44:23.627
TO EACH OTHER. HOWEVER ONLY SIX

00:44:23.694 --> 00:44:24.595
HAD FORMALLY ADOPTED THE

00:44:24.661 --> 00:44:26.263
STANDARDS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:28.298
FORMALLY ADOPT THE STANDARDS

00:44:28.365 --> 00:44:31.368
BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE IT. A

00:44:31.435 --> 00:44:33.937
REPEATABLE IT CONSISTENT WAY TO

00:44:34.004 --> 00:44:35.305
ENSURE THAT YOU'RE PROTECTING

00:44:35.372 --> 00:44:37.574
YOUR ASSETS IT'S BEST INDUSTRY

00:44:37.641 --> 00:44:39.910
BEST PRACTICES. IN IT ALSO

00:44:39.977 --> 00:44:41.445
PROVIDES AN AVENUE FOR YOU TO

00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:44.681
EVALUATE YOURSELF OR FOR OTHER

00:44:44.748 --> 00:44:45.249
ENTITIES THAT ARE YOU H. U.

00:44:45.315 --> 00:44:47.684
AGAINST THOSE STANDARDS. IN IN

00:44:47.751 --> 00:44:49.119
ADDITION TO THAT WE FOUND THAT

00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:51.455
ONLY FOUR OF THE TEN ENTITIES

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:52.523
HAD FULLY ASSESS THEMSELVES

00:44:52.589 --> 00:44:54.324
AGAINST THE STANDARDS MEANING

00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:56.560
THE REMAINING ENTITIES. HAD

00:44:56.627 --> 00:44:57.828
AREAS IN THEIR SECURITY

00:44:57.895 --> 00:44:59.096
PRACTICES THAT THEY HADN'T

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:01.065
LOOKED AT SO THEY COULD HAVE

00:45:01.131 --> 00:45:02.366
ADDITIONAL WEAKNESSES IN THESE

00:45:02.433 --> 00:45:03.934
AREAS BUT THEY JUST HAD LOOKED

00:45:04.001 --> 00:45:05.869
AT THOSE AREAS. AND THAT'S

00:45:05.936 --> 00:45:09.139
HIGHLIGHTED BY ENTITY BE ENTITY

00:45:09.206 --> 00:45:11.075
BE HAD DONE AND ASSESSMENTS

00:45:11.141 --> 00:45:13.143
THAT LOOK AT OF A SUBSET OF

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:16.113
THEIR CONTROLS. AND WHEN WE ASK

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:18.082
THEM ABOUT WHY THEY DIDN'T LOOK

00:45:18.148 --> 00:45:19.783
AT THE FULL SCOPE OF THEIR

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:21.885
STANDARDS. A RESPONSE THEY WENT

00:45:21.952 --> 00:45:23.587
OUT AND FINISH THE ASSESSMENT

00:45:23.654 --> 00:45:24.888
THEY DID A SUPPLEMENTAL

00:45:24.955 --> 00:45:25.656
ASSESSMENT THAT LOOK AT THE

00:45:25.722 --> 00:45:27.758
FULL SCOPE OF ALL THE CONTROLS.

00:45:27.825 --> 00:45:29.093
WHEN THEY WERE DONE THEY REPORT

00:45:29.159 --> 00:45:31.128
BACK TO US THAT THEY WERE ONLY

00:45:31.195 --> 00:45:32.429
51% COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE

00:45:32.496 --> 00:45:34.832
ADDITIONAL STANDARDS SO. THERE

00:45:34.898 --> 00:45:36.166
WAS A LOT OF AREAS OF NON

00:45:36.233 --> 00:45:37.568
COMPLIANCE THAT THEY JUST HAND

00:45:37.634 --> 00:45:39.670
IDENTIFIED BECAUSE THEY HAD

00:45:39.736 --> 00:45:42.706
LOOK VERY NARROWLY INITIALLY.

00:45:42.773 --> 00:45:44.675
AND AS MS HOUSE SAID EARLIER

00:45:44.741 --> 00:45:46.410
THESE FINDINGS ARE VERY SIMILAR

00:45:46.477 --> 00:45:48.445
TARA TWENTY FIFTEEN. AUDIT

00:45:48.512 --> 00:45:50.280
WHERE WE LOOK AT THE APARTMENT

00:45:50.347 --> 00:45:50.814
TECHNOLOGY IN THE ENTITIES

00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:53.917
UNDER ITS PURVIEW IN THAT AUDIT

00:45:53.984 --> 00:45:57.154
NEARLY ALL SURVEY RESPONDENTS

00:45:57.221 --> 00:45:57.754
SAID THAT THEY WERE NOT FULLY

00:45:57.821 --> 00:46:00.991
COMPLIANT. AND THAT'S DESPITE

00:46:01.058 --> 00:46:03.160
ABOUT HALF OF THEM PREVIOUSLY

00:46:03.227 --> 00:46:04.495
REPORTING THAT APARTMENT

00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:05.829
TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY WERE FULLY

00:46:05.896 --> 00:46:07.865
COMPLIANT AND WHEN WE FOLLOWED

00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:10.834
UP ON THAT DISCREPANCY WE WERE

00:46:10.901 --> 00:46:12.603
TOLD THAT. THEY HAD USED A

00:46:12.669 --> 00:46:14.538
CHECKLIST THEY ONLY CONTAIN

00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:16.773
HIGH LEVEL LOOK AT A SUBSET OF

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.609
THE CONTROLS SO THEY WERE THEY

00:46:18.675 --> 00:46:19.209
WERE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM

00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:21.378
WHERE THEY LOOK VERY NARROWLY

00:46:21.445 --> 00:46:23.213
TO EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT THEY

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:27.251
WERE FULLY COMPLIANT. AND THEN

00:46:27.317 --> 00:46:28.519
AS MISS HOW SAID. WE

00:46:28.585 --> 00:46:30.187
RECOMMENDED A LOT OF

00:46:30.254 --> 00:46:33.657
IMPROVEMENTS TO OVERSIGHT. AND

00:46:33.724 --> 00:46:34.892
DOES IMPLEMENT OR THOSE

00:46:34.958 --> 00:46:35.792
RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:37.594
IMPLEMENTED AND AS A RESULT IN

00:46:37.661 --> 00:46:39.096
JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE

00:46:39.163 --> 00:46:40.397
CONCLUDED THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:42.099
TECHNOLOGY HAD IMPROVED ITS

00:46:42.166 --> 00:46:44.535
OVERSIGHT IN THE COMPLIANCE OF

00:46:44.601 --> 00:46:46.470
THE ENTITIES THAT IT OVERSEAS

00:46:46.537 --> 00:46:47.938
HAD INCREASE SO THIS REALLY

00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:49.706
HIGHLIGHTS THE FACT THAT

00:46:49.773 --> 00:46:50.174
OVERSIGHT CAN HAVE. ON

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.010
COMPLIANCE. HOWEVER WHEN WE

00:46:53.076 --> 00:46:54.645
LOOK AT NON REPORTING ENTITIES

00:46:54.711 --> 00:46:55.379
THEY DON'T HAVE A SIMILAR

00:46:55.445 --> 00:46:58.115
OVERSIGHT STRUCTURE MOST OF THE

00:46:58.182 --> 00:47:00.417
ENTITIES. WE REVIEWED SAID THEY

00:47:00.484 --> 00:47:01.552
DON'T HAVE AN OVERSIGHT

00:47:01.618 --> 00:47:03.020
FRAMEWORK THAT WOULD REQUIRE

00:47:03.086 --> 00:47:03.554
THEM TO ASSESS THEMSELVES

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:08.559
AGAINST. ANY INDUSTRY STANDARDS

00:47:08.625 --> 00:47:10.994
COVER WE DID NOTE THAT. THREE

00:47:11.061 --> 00:47:12.095
OF THE FOUR ENTITIES THAT HAD

00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:14.064
FULLY ASSESS THEMSELVES DID

00:47:14.131 --> 00:47:15.098
HAVE AN OVERSIGHT FRAMEWORK

00:47:15.165 --> 00:47:17.034
THAT REQUIRED THOSE ASSESSMENTS

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:17.634
SO ONCE AGAIN HIGHLIGHTING THE

00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:21.772
IMPACT OF. OF OVERSIGHT SO AS A

00:47:21.838 --> 00:47:23.607
RESULT WE MADE THREE

00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:25.275
RECOMMENDATIONS THE LEGISLATURE

00:47:25.342 --> 00:47:27.844
SPECIFICALLY RECOMMENDED THAT.

00:47:27.911 --> 00:47:29.479
THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE NON

00:47:29.546 --> 00:47:31.248
REPORTING ENTITIES TO ADOPT A

00:47:31.315 --> 00:47:35.385
FRAMER COMPARABLE TO ST FIFTY

00:47:35.452 --> 00:47:35.953
THREE HUNDRED THE FRAMEWORK

00:47:36.019 --> 00:47:38.789
MAINTAINED BY DEPARTMENT

00:47:38.855 --> 00:47:42.092
TECHNOLOGY. THAT THEY REGULARLY

00:47:42.159 --> 00:47:43.293
MEASURE THEMSELVES AGAINST

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.363
THOSE STANDARDS. AT LEAST EVERY

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:47.364
THREE YEARS AND THEN THAT THEY

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:50.033
CONFIDENTIALLY CERTIFY

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:51.535
COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE STANDARDS

00:47:51.602 --> 00:47:53.470
TO LEGISLATURE AND IF NOT IF

00:47:53.537 --> 00:47:54.905
APPLICABLE THAT THEY SUBMIT

00:47:54.972 --> 00:47:57.941
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS. FOR

00:47:58.008 --> 00:48:01.278
ANY OUTSTANDING DEFICIENCIES.

00:48:01.345 --> 00:48:04.615
SO THAT'S AN OVERVIEW OF OUR

00:48:04.681 --> 00:48:05.249
AUDIT AND WITH THAT I'LL TAKING

00:48:05.315 --> 00:48:08.318
QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:48:08.385 --> 00:48:10.554
AT THIS TIME ITSELF IN A FOR

00:48:10.621 --> 00:48:11.188
SOME QUESTIONS MISTER COUNTY GO

00:48:11.255 --> 00:48:14.024
AT. THANKS VERY MUCH FOR THE

00:48:14.091 --> 00:48:16.260
PRESENTATION FOR THE AUDIT SO

00:48:16.326 --> 00:48:16.994
IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:18.195
CORRECTLY WHENEVER WE TRIED TO

00:48:18.262 --> 00:48:19.529
DO KIND OF ALONG THE LINES WE

00:48:19.596 --> 00:48:21.265
RECOMMENDING THE CONSTITUTIONAL

00:48:21.331 --> 00:48:22.199
OFFICERS GENERALLY SHOW UP AND

00:48:22.266 --> 00:48:25.636
COMPLAIN ABOUT IT. SO I MY

00:48:25.702 --> 00:48:28.939
QUESTION IS. THE FACT THAT

00:48:29.006 --> 00:48:30.440
THESE ENTITIES ARE THAT ARE NOT

00:48:30.507 --> 00:48:31.475
UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE

00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:32.776
GOVERNOR ARE NOT REQUIRED FOR

00:48:32.843 --> 00:48:34.978
REPORTER STATE LAW THAT'S A

00:48:35.045 --> 00:48:36.513
CREATURE OF STATUTE I ASSUME

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:39.716
SO. I WATER THE CONSTITUTIONAL

00:48:39.783 --> 00:48:42.419
LIMITS AS FAR AS BRINGING THOSE

00:48:42.486 --> 00:48:44.621
ENTITIES UNDER THE SAME SORT OF

00:48:44.688 --> 00:48:47.257
OVERSIGHT AND POLICIES AS THOSE

00:48:47.324 --> 00:48:48.191
UNDER CONTROL THE GOVERNOR AND

00:48:48.258 --> 00:48:49.393
THEN IF THERE ARE NO

00:48:49.459 --> 00:48:50.827
CONSTITUTIONAL BARRIERS ARE

00:48:50.894 --> 00:48:52.863
THERE ANY. REASONS POTENTIALLY

00:48:52.929 --> 00:48:54.865
WHY THEY SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECT

00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:56.033
TO THE SAME STANDARDS AND

00:48:56.099 --> 00:48:57.534
PROTOCOLS. RIGHT THANK YOU

00:48:57.601 --> 00:48:58.635
MISTER KILEY I DON'T KNOW IF

00:48:58.702 --> 00:48:59.569
THERE ARE SPECIFIC

00:48:59.636 --> 00:49:02.172
CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS MY

00:49:02.239 --> 00:49:03.440
UNDERSTANDING IS THE CONCERN

00:49:03.507 --> 00:49:05.108
THE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS HAD

00:49:05.175 --> 00:49:07.077
IN THE PAST WAS SOME OF THE

00:49:07.144 --> 00:49:08.712
LEGISLATION THAT WAS PROPOSED

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:10.380
WAS TO HAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL.

00:49:10.447 --> 00:49:12.182
REPORT THE INFORMATION TO THE

00:49:12.249 --> 00:49:13.617
DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY WHICH

00:49:13.684 --> 00:49:15.152
IS IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SO

00:49:15.218 --> 00:49:16.853
THEY HAD A CONCERN WITH RESPECT

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.622
TO THEIR INDEPENDENCE WE

00:49:18.689 --> 00:49:19.389
BELIEVE THE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:49:19.456 --> 00:49:20.724
THAT WE'VE MADE IN THIS REPORT

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:22.092
WHERE. THE CONSTITUTIONAL

00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:23.360
OFFICERS AND OTHER ENTITIES

00:49:23.427 --> 00:49:25.562
JUDICIAL BRANCH ENTITIES WOULD

00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:27.264
REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE SAID

00:49:27.331 --> 00:49:28.965
SEPARATE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT

00:49:29.032 --> 00:49:30.634
BUT THE LEGISLATURE HAS A

00:49:30.701 --> 00:49:32.102
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF OVERSIGHT

00:49:32.169 --> 00:49:33.537
OVER THOSE PARTICULAR ENTITIES

00:49:33.603 --> 00:49:35.572
BUT IT WOULD NOT. IT WOULD NOT

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:37.641
IN OUR VIEW CAUSE A PROBLEM

00:49:37.708 --> 00:49:38.075
WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:49:38.141 --> 00:49:43.213
INDEPENDENCE ISSUE THAT. THE

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:43.780
CONSTITUTIONAL RAISED IN THE

00:49:43.847 --> 00:49:49.619
PAST. LOOKED AT LEGAL HERE

00:49:49.686 --> 00:49:50.921
TODAY BUT I HAVE THEM LOOK AT

00:49:50.987 --> 00:49:51.755
SOME STATUTORY PROVISIONS UNDER

00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:52.789
THEY THE OPEN RECORDS ACT

00:49:52.856 --> 00:49:53.724
LEGISLATIVE OPEN RECORDS ACT

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:54.891
AND THERE IS LANGUAGE IN THE

00:49:54.958 --> 00:49:56.126
LEGISLATIVE OPEN RECORDS ACT

00:49:56.193 --> 00:49:57.461
THAT ALLOWS THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:49:57.527 --> 00:50:00.864
KEEP INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL

00:50:00.931 --> 00:50:01.698
AT PARTICULAR IF THERE'S A ALL

00:50:01.765 --> 00:50:04.234
A SIMILAR LOSS SO MY ATTORNEYS

00:50:04.301 --> 00:50:05.902
LOOKED AT THE PUBLIC RECORDS

00:50:05.969 --> 00:50:06.903
ACT AND THERE IS SPECIFIC

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:08.105
LANGUAGE IN THE PUBLIC RECORDS

00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:10.841
ACT THAT PROTECTS INFORMATION

00:50:10.907 --> 00:50:13.110
SECURITY FROM DISCLOSURE SO

00:50:13.176 --> 00:50:15.779
THAT CAN THAT CAN BE YOU DON'T

00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:17.047
HAVE TO DISCLOSE THAT UNDER THE

00:50:17.114 --> 00:50:18.482
PUBLIC RECORDS ACT SO THE

00:50:18.548 --> 00:50:20.350
LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE TAKEN

00:50:20.417 --> 00:50:21.518
ISMS WITHIN. THE OPEN RECORDS

00:50:21.585 --> 00:50:23.286
ACT TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THIS

00:50:23.353 --> 00:50:25.522
INFORMATION SO WE THINK THE

00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:27.758
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE IN

00:50:27.824 --> 00:50:29.826
THE REPORT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE

00:50:29.893 --> 00:50:31.128
THE REPORTS CAN GO TO THE

00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:32.629
LEGISLATURE THE CORRECTIVE

00:50:32.696 --> 00:50:33.830
ACTION PLANS CAN GO TO THE

00:50:33.897 --> 00:50:35.632
LOVED LEGISLATURE AND THE

00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:37.401
LEGISLATURE THROUGH THE TWO

00:50:37.467 --> 00:50:39.870
COMMITTEES I'M HERE TODAY HEY.

00:50:39.936 --> 00:50:43.073
WE SPECIFY ASSEMBLY PRIVACY AND

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:46.243
CONSUMER PROTECTION CYBER

00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.877
SECURITY COULD ALSO BE INVOLVED

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:52.516
UP WOULD. HOW CONSTITUTIONAL AS

00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:53.383
IN OTHER I ENTITIES ARE DOING

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:53.884
AND PROTECTING DATA AND

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:54.885
REMEDIATING ISSUES THAT ARE

00:50:54.951 --> 00:50:57.053
THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. BUT

00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:58.088
IN THEORY IF I WE WANTED ALL

00:50:58.155 --> 00:50:59.589
THAT OTHER CONCERTS OFFICES

00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:01.358
REPORT ADD TO THAT PART OF

00:51:01.425 --> 00:51:01.958
TECHNOLOGY IT WOULD THERE BE

00:51:02.025 --> 00:51:03.527
ANY CONSTITUTIONAL BARRIER THAT

00:51:03.593 --> 00:51:04.861
OR THAT JUST BE VIEWED AS SORT

00:51:04.928 --> 00:51:06.129
OF AN INFRINGEMENT ON THEIR

00:51:06.196 --> 00:51:08.131
INDEPENDENCE YOU KNOW I DON'T

00:51:08.198 --> 00:51:09.433
I'M NOT A LAWYER SO I DON'T

00:51:09.499 --> 00:51:11.067
KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THERE WOULD

00:51:11.134 --> 00:51:12.602
BE SPECIFIC CONSTITUTIONAL

00:51:12.669 --> 00:51:14.137
ISSUES I DIDN'T I'M NOT

00:51:14.204 --> 00:51:15.138
FAMILIAR WITH WHAT THEIR

00:51:15.205 --> 00:51:17.040
ARGUMENTS WERE AT THE TIME. I

00:51:17.107 --> 00:51:18.308
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING IF THE

00:51:18.375 --> 00:51:19.743
LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED IN AND

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:21.478
PURSUING THAT AVENUE PERHAPS

00:51:21.545 --> 00:51:24.147
WORK WITH LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL I

00:51:24.214 --> 00:51:24.714
DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO.

00:51:24.781 --> 00:51:27.484
ANSWER THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU

00:51:27.551 --> 00:51:31.922
FOR. SEVEN I HAVE A FEW

00:51:31.988 --> 00:51:33.557
QUESTIONS THIS IT DOES KIND OF

00:51:33.623 --> 00:51:34.991
SEEM LIKE A RE RUN OF FOUR

00:51:35.058 --> 00:51:36.326
YEARS AGO SO BUT HOPEFULLY WE

00:51:36.393 --> 00:51:37.928
END UP WITH THE SAME KIND OF

00:51:37.994 --> 00:51:39.796
OUTCOMES BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'VE

00:51:39.863 --> 00:51:41.865
SAID MANY TIMES THAT SAID

00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:44.401
DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY REALLY

00:51:44.468 --> 00:51:48.472
OF. STEPPED UP AND. SO F AYE

00:51:48.538 --> 00:51:49.539
AYE WE PROBABLY CAN'T TALK

00:51:49.606 --> 00:51:51.842
ABOUT BLANCA WHETHER THIS IS

00:51:51.908 --> 00:51:53.577
ACCURATE OR NOT BUT DO YOU

00:51:53.643 --> 00:51:55.278
THINK THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL

00:51:55.345 --> 00:51:58.348
OFFICES AND OTHER. THE OTHER

00:51:58.415 --> 00:52:00.250
NON REPORTING ENTITIES HAVE

00:52:00.317 --> 00:52:03.220
SUFFICIENT INFORMATION SECURITY

00:52:03.286 --> 00:52:05.388
EXPERTISE IN THE CAPABILITY TO

00:52:05.455 --> 00:52:06.656
OPERATE SEPARATELY OR

00:52:06.723 --> 00:52:07.491
INDEPENDENTLY FROM THE

00:52:07.557 --> 00:52:09.960
EXECUTIVE BRANCH NOW I KNOW WE

00:52:10.026 --> 00:52:11.228
CAN'T SAY ABOUT ALL OF THEM AND

00:52:11.294 --> 00:52:13.330
YOU CAN'T CALL OUT CERTAIN

00:52:13.396 --> 00:52:15.432
AGENCIES BUT CERTAINLY WE KNOW

00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:17.534
THAT THAT DEPARTMENTS LIKE THE

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:19.336
AG AND SECRETARY OF STATE HAVE

00:52:19.402 --> 00:52:20.937
TO MEET. HIGHER STANDARDS

00:52:21.004 --> 00:52:22.272
THEMSELVES SO WE PRESUME THAT

00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:24.841
THEY ARE. MOSTLY DOING WHAT

00:52:24.908 --> 00:52:26.610
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO SOLVE. SO

00:52:26.676 --> 00:52:28.245
I MEAN I MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE TO

00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:29.880
SAY THAT BUT JUST IN GENERAL DO

00:52:29.946 --> 00:52:31.114
YOU THINK THE EXPERTISE IS

00:52:31.181 --> 00:52:32.849
THERE TO OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY

00:52:32.916 --> 00:52:34.784
SO WE START A VARIETY OF

00:52:34.851 --> 00:52:36.786
CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE DIFFERENT

00:52:36.853 --> 00:52:39.356
ENTITIES WE WENT TO WE WENT TO

00:52:39.422 --> 00:52:40.457
SOME ENTITIES THAT. SIR BUT

00:52:40.524 --> 00:52:42.826
THEY WERE MOSTLY OR FULLY

00:52:42.893 --> 00:52:45.795
COMPLIANT BASED FULLY ENTITIES

00:52:45.862 --> 00:52:47.697
FULLY ASSESS THEMSELVES THEY

00:52:47.764 --> 00:52:48.431
HAD OFFICIALLY ADOPTED

00:52:48.498 --> 00:52:50.600
STANDARDS AND THEY HAD A VERY

00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:53.336
ROBUST PROCESS WE HIGHLIGHT ONE

00:52:53.403 --> 00:52:55.071
ENTITY IN THE REPORT THAT HAND

00:52:55.138 --> 00:52:57.841
ADOPTED ANY STANDARDS AND THEY

00:52:57.908 --> 00:52:59.376
RELIED SOLELY ON THE JUDGMENT

00:52:59.442 --> 00:53:03.647
OF THEIR IT MANAGER. SO IS A

00:53:03.713 --> 00:53:08.585
VERY LESS FORMAL PROCESS. LESS

00:53:08.652 --> 00:53:10.754
ROBUST SO WE REALLY SAW A WIDE

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:13.423
RANGE WORKS SOME PEOPLE HAD. A

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:14.024
VERY COMPLETE PROCESS AND SOME

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:15.959
PEOPLE DIDN'T SO I'M NOT SURE

00:53:16.026 --> 00:53:17.928
IF YOU THIS SERVICES DEPARTMENT

00:53:17.994 --> 00:53:19.663
OF TECHNOLOGY BUT HOW DID THE

00:53:19.729 --> 00:53:20.597
INDEPENDENT SECURITY

00:53:20.664 --> 00:53:22.332
ASSESSMENTS PERFORMED BY

00:53:22.399 --> 00:53:25.001
OUTSIDE VENDORS COMPARED TO THE

00:53:25.068 --> 00:53:25.569
SECURITY ASSESSMENTS OF THE

00:53:25.635 --> 00:53:28.638
DEPARTMENT OF MILITARY. WE

00:53:28.705 --> 00:53:31.241
DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY COMPARE

00:53:31.308 --> 00:53:34.044
ASSESSMENTS DONE. ACROSS

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:37.247
DIFFERENT VENDORS. WE ARE

00:53:37.314 --> 00:53:39.049
ACTUALLY LOOK TO SEE WHAT

00:53:39.115 --> 00:53:40.283
ASSESSMENTS HAD THEY HAD AND

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:42.118
HOW MUCH OF THEIR STANDARDS

00:53:42.185 --> 00:53:44.321
THAT THEY FOLLOW WE DID WE DO

00:53:44.387 --> 00:53:46.957
NOTE THAT MANY ENTITIES DO USE

00:53:47.023 --> 00:53:49.426
THE DEPARTMENT MILITARY FOR

00:53:49.492 --> 00:53:53.463
THOSE THOSE ASSESSMENTS. IN DID

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:55.065
THOSE ARE GOOD ASSESSMENTS AND

00:53:55.131 --> 00:53:57.334
THEY'RE VERY HELPFUL BUT

00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:57.934
THEY'RE NOT COMPREHENSIVE BY

00:53:58.001 --> 00:54:01.137
THEMSELVES SO. SO WE EXPECT

00:54:01.204 --> 00:54:02.906
THEM TO DO ADDITIONAL

00:54:02.973 --> 00:54:06.543
ASSESSMENTS ON TOP. YES AND I

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:08.078
MEAN ULTIMATELY YOU WANT TO BE

00:54:08.144 --> 00:54:10.480
ABLE TO DO AN APPLES TO APPLES

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:11.047
MEMBERS AND EVEN IF YOU'RE

00:54:11.114 --> 00:54:15.752
USING A OUTSIDE. OF VENDORS SO

00:54:15.819 --> 00:54:17.287
ONE OF THE CONCERNS WE HAD WITH

00:54:17.354 --> 00:54:19.556
THE BILL FROM LAST YEAR AND

00:54:19.623 --> 00:54:22.325
THIS YEAR IS THAT. THERE WAS

00:54:22.392 --> 00:54:27.998
SOME CONCERN ABOUT. THAT THE

00:54:28.064 --> 00:54:29.099
STANDARDS MIGHT JEOPARDIZE THE

00:54:29.165 --> 00:54:30.300
INDEPENDENCE OF THE

00:54:30.367 --> 00:54:31.835
CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICES IS THAT

00:54:31.901 --> 00:54:36.940
A. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

00:54:37.007 --> 00:54:38.241
SAYINGBUT WE DON'T SEE A

00:54:38.308 --> 00:54:39.843
PROBLEM WITH I MEAN IT IT WOULD

00:54:39.909 --> 00:54:42.245
BE EACH INDIVIDUAL ENTITY CAN

00:54:42.312 --> 00:54:43.780
ADOPT STANDARDS AND AS MISTER

00:54:43.847 --> 00:54:45.315
WARD INDICATED AS WE EXPLAIN IN

00:54:45.382 --> 00:54:46.016
THE REPORT THERE'S

00:54:46.082 --> 00:54:47.617
INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS THERE'S

00:54:47.684 --> 00:54:48.952
THE SAM FIFTY THREE HUNDRED

00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:50.053
THERE'S OTHER STANDARDS AND WE

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.221
DID A COMPARISON OF THOSE

00:54:51.287 --> 00:54:52.389
STANDARDS TO SEE ARE THEY

00:54:52.455 --> 00:54:54.324
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AND AS

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:55.625
MISTER WARD INDICATED THEY'RE

00:54:55.692 --> 00:54:57.227
RELATIVELY SIMILAR SO EACH OF

00:54:57.293 --> 00:54:58.428
THE ENTITIES COULD ADOPT

00:54:58.495 --> 00:55:00.230
STANDARDS. THAT THEY THINK

00:55:00.296 --> 00:55:01.598
WORKS FOR THEIR PARTICULAR

00:55:01.665 --> 00:55:04.467
AGENCY AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT

00:55:04.534 --> 00:55:05.902
I MEAN THAT ALLOWS THEM TO

00:55:05.969 --> 00:55:09.005
CONTINUE THAT INDEPENDENCE AND

00:55:09.072 --> 00:55:10.140
FOR THOSE ENTITIES THEN TO BE

00:55:10.206 --> 00:55:11.341
REQUIRED TO ASSESS THEMSELVES

00:55:11.408 --> 00:55:12.575
AGAINST STANDARDS THAT THEY

00:55:12.642 --> 00:55:14.844
HAVE FORMALLY ADOPTED THAT WAS

00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:15.779
ONE OF THE ISSUES IN THIS

00:55:15.845 --> 00:55:17.213
REPORT THEY'RE THEY'RE

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.415
SUGGESTING THAT THEY'RE

00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:19.549
FOLLOWING STANDARDS BUT THEY

00:55:19.616 --> 00:55:20.784
HAVEN'T FORMALLY ADOPTED THEM

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:22.552
AND BASICALLY SAID KNOWN FOR

00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:24.754
THAT AGENCY SAYING WE ARE GOING

00:55:24.821 --> 00:55:25.822
TO COMPLY WITH ALL OF THESE

00:55:25.889 --> 00:55:27.691
STANDARDS NEST OR WHATEVER IT

00:55:27.757 --> 00:55:28.958
THE STANDARDS THEY CHOOSE TO

00:55:29.025 --> 00:55:30.960
COMPLY WITH. THEN THEY WOULD BE

00:55:31.027 --> 00:55:32.128
ABLE TO ASSESS THEMSELVES

00:55:32.195 --> 00:55:34.230
AGAINST THOSE STANDARDS AND

00:55:34.297 --> 00:55:36.766
THEN AS WE RECOMMEND REPORT

00:55:36.833 --> 00:55:38.668
THAT INFORMATION TO THE

00:55:38.735 --> 00:55:40.270
LEGISLATURE AND CERTAINLY

00:55:40.336 --> 00:55:42.172
REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE DONE

00:55:42.238 --> 00:55:44.007
A COMPREHENSIVE TEST IDENTIFIED

00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:47.010
HIGH RISK DEFICIENCY IS GOING

00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:47.610
TO BE A THING KNOWS AND HERE'S

00:55:47.677 --> 00:55:49.879
OUR TIME FRAME SO I FROM OUR

00:55:49.946 --> 00:55:52.982
VIEW WE DON'T THINK THERE IS A

00:55:53.049 --> 00:55:54.718
PROBLEM WITH RESPECT DEPENDS IF

00:55:54.784 --> 00:55:55.518
REPORTING TOTAL JUST LET RATHER

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:58.154
AND TO THE PARK TECHNOLOGY.

00:55:58.221 --> 00:56:01.257
OKAY AND THEN OF I AM IN THAT

00:56:01.324 --> 00:56:03.660
DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY SO THE

00:56:03.727 --> 00:56:07.530
ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS

00:56:07.597 --> 00:56:09.199
THAT THEY HAVE DONE OVER THE

00:56:09.265 --> 00:56:11.634
LAST TWO YEARS MAJORITY OF

00:56:11.701 --> 00:56:17.774
METRIC ABOUT. YOU KNOW FIFTEEN

00:56:17.841 --> 00:56:26.716
ASSESSMENT AUDIT. DEPARTMENT

00:56:26.783 --> 00:56:27.751
TECHNOLOGY I DON'T HAVE THAT

00:56:27.817 --> 00:56:29.619
KIND OF EXPERTISE SO YOUNG

00:56:29.686 --> 00:56:32.889
POTENTIALLY AS A BEST PRACTICE.

00:56:32.956 --> 00:56:33.990
THEY COULD THEY COULD PURSUE

00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:35.291
THAT I THINK WHERE THEY ARE

00:56:35.358 --> 00:56:36.626
RIGHT NOW THERE'S SO MANY THAT

00:56:36.693 --> 00:56:38.161
AREN'T FULLY ASSESSING

00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:39.429
THEMSELVES THEY DON'T KNOW

00:56:39.496 --> 00:56:42.398
WHERE THEY ARE HOW COMPLIANT

00:56:42.465 --> 00:56:45.602
THEY ARE. SO. FIRST THEY WOULD

00:56:45.668 --> 00:56:47.137
HAVE TO SET A BASELINE AND THEN

00:56:47.203 --> 00:56:49.239
MOVE FOR. SO OVER TIME IT

00:56:49.305 --> 00:56:50.406
SOUNDS LIKE THEY WOULD BENEFIT

00:56:50.473 --> 00:56:52.976
FROM IT BUT AS OF TODAY THEY

00:56:53.042 --> 00:56:54.244
NEED TO ESTABLISH STANDARDS

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:54.644
ASSESS THEMSELVES

00:56:54.711 --> 00:56:56.913
COMPREHENSIVELY SAID ROOM YOU

00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:59.349
KNOW DEVELOP MITIGATION PLANS

00:56:59.415 --> 00:57:00.517
AND THEN THE MATURITY MODEL AND

00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:02.185
AGAIN I'M NOT THE EXPERT. THAT

00:57:02.252 --> 00:57:04.420
WOULD BE BENEFICIAL IN THE

00:57:04.487 --> 00:57:04.988
FUTURE. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY

00:57:05.054 --> 00:57:08.958
MUCH. I'M JUST A COUPLE OF

00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:09.692
FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS IT ARE

00:57:09.759 --> 00:57:12.061
THERE ANY ADVANTAGES. LET'S SAY

00:57:12.128 --> 00:57:16.199
BETWEEN. UTILIZING THAT THE

00:57:16.266 --> 00:57:17.634
MILITARY DEPARTMENT WHEN IT

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:19.035
COMES TO ASSESSMENT VERSUS A

00:57:19.102 --> 00:57:21.871
PRIVATE AND ENTITY OR A PRIVATE

00:57:21.938 --> 00:57:24.307
VENDOR. YOU KNOW. DID YOU KNOW

00:57:24.374 --> 00:57:26.176
OF WE DID NOT SPECIFICALLY LOOK

00:57:26.242 --> 00:57:29.746
AT. THE QUALITY OF THE OF THE

00:57:29.813 --> 00:57:31.347
REVIEWS WE WE'RE LOOKING TO

00:57:31.414 --> 00:57:33.616
MAKE SURE DID YOU HAVE A REVIEW

00:57:33.683 --> 00:57:35.685
WHAT DID YOU LOOK AT. ARE YOU

00:57:35.752 --> 00:57:37.987
ADDRESSING DEFICIENCIES SO WE

00:57:38.054 --> 00:57:40.323
DID NOT COMPARE PRIVATE VENDORS

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.757
VERSES MILITARY AND

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:45.261
METHODOLOGIES. SO IN YOUR VIEW

00:57:45.328 --> 00:57:47.197
SO LONG AS THEY ARE IN

00:57:47.263 --> 00:57:49.566
COMPLYING WITH ONE OF THE THREE

00:57:49.632 --> 00:57:52.635
STANDARDS ARE AND THE- YOU KNOW

00:57:52.702 --> 00:57:54.904
COULD POTENTIALLY BE IT

00:57:54.971 --> 00:57:55.972
MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE SO

00:57:56.039 --> 00:57:58.508
TO SPEAK AND THEN REPORTING THE

00:57:58.575 --> 00:58:01.244
RESULTS OR THE OUTCOME TO THE

00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:02.045
LEGISLATURE THAT SUFFICES AS

00:58:02.111 --> 00:58:03.680
FAR AS THE AUDITOR'S.

00:58:03.746 --> 00:58:05.348
ASSESSMENTS CONCERNS I'VE GONE

00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:07.784
A CORRECTED. THAT'S CORRECT GOT

00:58:07.851 --> 00:58:09.619
IT SO IN ANY JUST I WANNA I

00:58:09.686 --> 00:58:10.987
DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT

00:58:11.054 --> 00:58:12.755
BUT BUT THE THREE STANDARDS

00:58:12.822 --> 00:58:15.124
THAT YOU MENTION SO THERE AS

00:58:15.191 --> 00:58:19.062
FAR AS THE QUALITY OR OTHERWISE

00:58:19.128 --> 00:58:20.430
THERE ARE COMPARABLE I THINK

00:58:20.496 --> 00:58:21.764
THE VOICE EASE WITH COMPARABLE

00:58:21.831 --> 00:58:24.467
IDEA A SIMILAR. AND WELL

00:58:24.534 --> 00:58:27.804
THERE'S THE I. S. O. OR THE SAM

00:58:27.871 --> 00:58:30.240
OR THE NEST STANDARDS TO THE

00:58:30.306 --> 00:58:31.608
YOU KNOW ALL THREE CENTERS ARE

00:58:31.674 --> 00:58:34.611
OKAY BYE BYE YOU FOLKS YES SO

00:58:34.677 --> 00:58:37.480
ON PAGE FIVE WE LAY OUT THE

00:58:37.547 --> 00:58:39.048
THREE MOST COMMON STANDARDS.

00:58:39.115 --> 00:58:41.217
AND IT'S THE I SO THAN BUSINESS

00:58:41.284 --> 00:58:43.253
AND SAM AND THERE'S A LOT OF

00:58:43.319 --> 00:58:46.089
OVERLAP IN FACT SAM SAYS THAT

00:58:46.155 --> 00:58:47.523
THE MINIMUM BASELINE SECURITY

00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:49.959
IS NEST. SO THERE'S A LOT OF

00:58:50.026 --> 00:58:51.895
OVERLAP A POINT AT EACH OTHER

00:58:51.961 --> 00:58:55.265
AND THEN ON THE NEXT PAGE PAGE

00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:57.734
SIX WE LAY OUT. AT A HIGH LEVEL

00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:58.601
WHAT THE STANDARDS TYPICALLY

00:58:58.668 --> 00:59:02.205
FOLLOW OR WOULD REQUIRE AND

00:59:02.272 --> 00:59:03.273
THEY'RE ALL STRUCTURE

00:59:03.339 --> 00:59:05.775
DIFFERENTLY BUT ADDRESS THE

00:59:05.842 --> 00:59:07.710
SAME AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE TO

00:59:07.777 --> 00:59:08.611
KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO PROTECT

00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:10.813
THEM WHAT LEVEL OF PROTECTION.

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.615
YOUR INFORMATION NEEDS GAP

00:59:12.682 --> 00:59:14.918
IDENTIFIER ASKS THING YOU HAVE

00:59:14.984 --> 00:59:16.486
TO PLAN TO PROTECT WHAT YOU

00:59:16.552 --> 00:59:17.987
HAVE AGAINST THOSE RISK AND ALL

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:19.022
ALL OF THEM FOLLOW A VERY

00:59:19.088 --> 00:59:21.357
SIMILAR PATTERN JUST THE

00:59:21.424 --> 00:59:27.864
FORMATTING AND. THE LEVEL OF

00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:32.268
DETAIL IS DIFFERENT. GOT IT.

00:59:32.335 --> 00:59:33.603
OKAY I ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:35.171
COMMENTS OKAY MYSTERY K. DO

00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:35.738
THAT FOR EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT

00:59:35.805 --> 00:59:36.940
YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC

00:59:37.006 --> 00:59:40.109
A TECHNICAL EXPERTISE.

00:59:40.176 --> 00:59:41.778
TECHNICAL EXPERTISE OBVIOUSLY

00:59:41.844 --> 00:59:44.314
HELPS I THINK YOU SOME LEVEL OF

00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:47.684
OVERSIGHT. BEYOND WHAT'S

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:49.953
HAPPENING NOW IS HELPFUL BIG

00:59:50.019 --> 00:59:51.220
SAMPLE WE POINT OUT WHERE AN

00:59:51.287 --> 00:59:53.723
ENTITY HAS DEFICIENCIES DATING

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:54.958
BACK TO TWENTY THIRTEEN AND

00:59:55.024 --> 00:59:57.794
THEY DON'T HAVE A PLAN. YOU

00:59:57.860 --> 00:59:59.595
DON'T NEED TECHNICAL EXPERTISE

00:59:59.662 --> 01:00:01.197
TO KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT A GOOD

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:03.666
SITUATION SO I THINK THERE'S

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:05.501
DEFINITELY SOME AREAS WHETHER

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:07.470
OR NOT ENTITIES ARE EVALUATING

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:08.404
THEMSELVES ARE NOT ARE THEY

01:00:08.471 --> 01:00:10.106
COMPLAINTS ARE THEY NOT. THERE

01:00:10.173 --> 01:00:11.874
SOME THINGS THAT DON'T NEED

01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:14.210
SPECIAL THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:15.912
AS YOU GET INTO WHAT

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:17.347
DEFICIENCIES ARE AND WHAT'S

01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:18.848
THEIR PLAN IS THAT A GOOD PLAN

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:21.050
IF YOU ADVANCE THE OVERSIGHT TO

01:00:21.117 --> 01:00:23.553
THAT LEVEL THEN THERE WOULD

01:00:23.619 --> 01:00:24.187
REQUIRE SOME LEVEL OF TECHNICAL

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:26.522
EXPERTISE. AND YOU HAD I MEAN

01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:28.524
THE VIEW IT SUGGESTED THAT THAT

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:29.892
THE OVERSIGHT COULD BE CARRIED

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:31.894
OUT BY THE LEGISLATURE. AS

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:34.664
OPPOSED TO SEE TV SO IS THERE

01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:36.065
DO YOU THINK THERE'S ENOUGH

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:38.167
EXPERTISE AND THE LEGISLATURE

01:00:38.234 --> 01:00:38.735
TO THE FACT THAT THAT THAT.

01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:41.437
WILL BUT I THINK THE

01:00:41.504 --> 01:00:43.072
LEGISLATURE HAS THE EXPERTISE

01:00:43.139 --> 01:00:44.807
AND THE ABILITY TO HOLD THE

01:00:44.874 --> 01:00:46.476
ENTITIES ACCOUNTABLE SOME OF

01:00:46.542 --> 01:00:47.944
THOSE ENTITIES VIEWS MY OFFICE

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:49.645
FOR EXAMPLE. WE HAVE AYE

01:00:49.712 --> 01:00:51.614
INTERNAL IT FOLKS WHO ARE

01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:53.249
EXTREMELY TALENTED WE

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:54.350
CONTRACTED OUT TO HAVE OUR

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:55.451
ASSESSMENT DONE BECAUSE BEFORE

01:00:55.518 --> 01:00:56.919
I WAS GONNA CRITICIZEANYBODY

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:58.287
ELSE I NEEDED TO KNOW. ARE WE

01:00:58.354 --> 01:01:00.256
FULLY COMPLIANT. WITH CERTAIN

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:01.557
STANDARDS AND WE WERE NOT AND

01:01:01.624 --> 01:01:02.992
WE NEED TO TIGHTEN UP CERTAIN

01:01:03.059 --> 01:01:04.861
THINGS SO WE HIRED THE

01:01:04.927 --> 01:01:06.929
EXPERTISE TO ASSIST US AND

01:01:06.996 --> 01:01:08.798
DIRECTING US HERE. HERE'S YOUR

01:01:08.865 --> 01:01:10.566
ASSESSMENT HERE THE WEAKNESSES

01:01:10.633 --> 01:01:12.135
THAT WERE IDENTIFIED THIS IS

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:13.403
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO FIX IT

01:01:13.469 --> 01:01:15.671
BUT I HAD INTERNAL FOLKS ABLE

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:17.673
TO DO THOSE TORT TYPES OF

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:19.609

WE HAVE A PLAN. WHERE WE'RE

01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:24.547
GONNA DRESS THE HIGH RISK

01:01:24.614 --> 01:01:27.650
DEFICIENCIES IF WE HAD ANY WHAT

01:01:27.717 --> 01:01:28.284
IS OUR APPROACH AND WHAT'S THE

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:30.053
TIME FRAME FOR FIXING THAT SO

01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:31.487
THE LEGISLATURE CERTAINLY HAS

01:01:31.554 --> 01:01:33.089
THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE A

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:34.857
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF OVERSIGHT AS

01:01:34.924 --> 01:01:36.459

01:11:42.731 --> 01:11:44.433
AS MISSION SO I JUST WANNA MAKE

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:45.834
SURE THAT WHEN WE SAID AND NINE

01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:47.836
REPORTING AGENCY WE DO HAVE

01:11:47.903 --> 01:11:49.705
DIFFERENT SCENARIO WHEN IT

01:11:52.875 --> 01:11:55.778
HOW DO YOU INTERFACE WITH THOSE

01:11:55.844 --> 01:11:56.345
ENTITIES THAT ARE CONSIDERED

01:11:56.412 --> 01:12:00.382
NON REPORTING. SO WE INTERFACE

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:02.051
WITH THEM IN SEVERAL ASPECT IN

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:03.152
IN FACT I WOULD ASK I'M IMPAIR

01:12:03.218 --> 01:12:04.286
ACHIEVE A POLICY TO CHIMING AT

01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:06.955
CC FIT AS WELL. THAT IN TO DATE

01:12:07.022 --> 01:12:08.190
WHEN IT COMES TO TECHNOLOGY

01:12:08.257 --> 01:12:10.959
OVERSIGHT JUST AS OUR SISTER

01:12:11.026 --> 01:12:11.994

CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICE IN MANY

01:12:25.307 --> 01:12:27.743
CASES IS THE PROJECT OVERSIGHT.

01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:29.144
SO WHEN THERE'S A TECHNOLOGY

01:12:29.211 --> 01:12:30.546
PROJECT A CERTAIN THRESHOLD

01:12:30.612 --> 01:12:32.314
THAT REQUIRES FINDING YOU KNOW

IF ANYTHING I YEAH JUST GO

01:12:49.331 --> 01:12:50.199
ALONG THE LINES ABSENT ACIDITY

01:12:50.265 --> 01:12:50.833
IS THERE CONTROL AGENCY SIMILAR

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:52.101

ENTITIES WITHIN THE EXECUTIVE

01:13:05.347 --> 01:13:07.516
BRANCH AS WELL AND THEN. THOSE

01:13:07.583 --> 01:13:09.017
STANDARDS THAT WE DO APPLY ARE

01:13:09.084 --> 01:13:10.219

01:13:18.861 --> 01:13:22.030
HR POLICIES AS WELL. SO THERE'S

01:13:22.097 --> 01:13:23.832
ALREADY THAT LEVEL OR SAY

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:25.000
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH SIMPLY

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:28.337

COMPLIANCE DO YOU THINK THAT IF

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:35.778
WE WERE TO DO THAT THAT WOULD

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:36.245
ACTUALLY IMPROVE OUR-

01:13:36.311 --> 01:13:38.914
INFORMATION SECURITY SITUATION.

01:13:38.981 --> 01:13:40.349
I WOULD I WOULD DEFINITELY SAID

01:13:40.415 --> 01:13:42.251
DIED DEPENDING ON WHAT ORDER

01:13:42.317 --> 01:13:43.852
CONSTITUTIONAL PROBABLY HAVE A

01:13:43.919 --> 01:13:46.155
DIFFERENT AREA OF THE CONCERNS

01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:47.823
VERSUS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES OR

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:49.892
ANOTHER BRANCH. I WOULD DEFER

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:50.859
TO THOSE CONCERNED FOR THEM TO

01:13:50.926 --> 01:13:53.262
SPEAK TO HOWEVER I DO WANT TO

01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:54.930
CLARIFY DIED EARLIER WHEN THERE

01:13:54.997 --> 01:13:57.166
WAS DISCUSSION. ABOUT THIS AND

01:13:57.232 --> 01:13:58.600
SPECIFICALLY ON THE YOU KNOW

01:13:58.667 --> 01:13:59.535
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO TO

01:13:59.601 --> 01:14:01.336
IMPROVE THE STATE WIDE SECURITY

01:14:01.403 --> 01:14:03.906
MEASURE. IS DEFINITELY NOT OUR

01:14:03.972 --> 01:14:06.642
INTENTION AT ALL TO HAVE ANY

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:09.144
INTERFERENCE OR IN PEAK INTO

01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:10.913
WHAT I CALL THE MAIN LINES OF

01:14:10.979 --> 01:14:12.447
BUSINESS OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL

01:14:12.514 --> 01:14:15.184
DEPARTMENTS. THE SECURITY

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:17.619
MEASURE SIMILAR TO WHEN IT

01:14:17.686 --> 01:14:20.222
COMES TO PROJECTS TO HR WE SEE

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:21.023
IT AS ME THAT ONE OF THE

01:14:21.089 --> 01:14:22.925
BUSINESS OPERATION. AND THAT'S

01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:26.829
WHERE WE LIKE TO SEE TO HAVE

01:14:26.895 --> 01:14:27.396
CONSISTENCY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:14:27.462 --> 01:14:30.032
MEASUREMENT AND OVERSIGHT.

01:14:30.098 --> 01:14:31.633
RIGHT SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.035
YOU KNOW SUBSECTORS ALASTOR IN

01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:34.069
THE WORLD WHERE WE WANT TO HAVE

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:36.705
OF FRAGMENTATION. IN TERMS OF

01:14:36.772 --> 01:14:39.575
WHAT WE'RE DOING AND SO THE

01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:40.976
DISTINCTION YOU JUST RECEIVED

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:41.877
TO MAKE SENSE I MEAN IT SEEMS

01:14:41.944 --> 01:14:43.145
TO ME THAT IF EXECUTIVE THE

01:14:43.212 --> 01:14:44.479
INDEPENDENCE OF. EACH OF THE

01:14:44.546 --> 01:14:45.614
EXECUTIVE OR EVEN THE

01:14:45.681 --> 01:14:47.115
INDEPENDENT EXECUTIVE AGENCIES

01:14:47.182 --> 01:14:48.650
A SOMETHING THAT'S- IMPORTANT

01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:50.619
YOU KNOW AS COMPLIANCE WITH AN

01:14:50.686 --> 01:14:51.587
INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARD

01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:52.821
AS A MINISTERIAL FUNCTION

01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:53.755
ESSENTIALLY I MEAN MAYBE YOU

01:14:53.822 --> 01:14:55.224
KNOW. THAT THAT'S NOT A POLICY

01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:58.327
MAKING FUNCTION AND SO I THE

01:14:58.393 --> 01:14:59.595
CONCERNS ABOUT INDEPENDENT SEEM

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:02.030
A LITTLE. AS UNFOUNDED TO ME

01:15:02.097 --> 01:15:03.265
AND IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:04.366
WE REALLY CARE ABOUT I MEAN ARE

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:05.400
THERE OTHER SOLUTIONS COULD WE

01:15:05.467 --> 01:15:07.536
MAKE YOUR DEPARTMENT SOMEHOW AN

01:15:07.603 --> 01:15:09.271
INDEPENDENT. DEPARTMENT SO THEN

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:10.572
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THIS CONCERN

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:11.974
ABOUT OTHER EXECUTIVE OFFICES

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:12.708
HAVEN'T REPORT TO SOMETHING

01:15:12.774 --> 01:15:13.976
THAT'S UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:16.945
GOVERNOR. WATER THAT WHAT WOULD

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:17.546
BE THE BEST WAY TO HAVE A MORE

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:20.449
UNIFIED APPROACH. I WOULDN'T

01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:21.283
VENTURE OUT TO SAID I HAVE

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:22.417
ANSWER FOR THAT THE BUT I THINK

01:15:22.484 --> 01:15:24.820
THIS IS WHY WERE. HERE HAVING A

01:15:24.887 --> 01:15:26.154
CONVERSATION AND REALLY

THE SAME AND- IN ALL FAIRNESS

01:15:34.096 --> 01:15:35.397
ALL THE INDEPENDENT ENTITY THAT

01:15:35.464 --> 01:15:36.665
WE HAVE TALKED TO THEY HAVE THE

01:15:36.732 --> 01:15:38.700
SAME. SIMILAR ANGLE IT IS THAT

01:15:38.767 --> 01:15:39.568
WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO WORK

01:15:39.635 --> 01:15:42.104
TOGETHER. TO ACHIEVE THE HIGHER

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:43.138
LEVEL OF CYBER SECURITY

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:45.507
PROTECTION. I THINK IS WOULD IT

01:15:45.574 --> 01:15:46.909
NEEDS TO HAVE A GOOD OPEN

01:15:46.975 --> 01:15:50.045
DIALOGUE ABOUT. HOW TO GET

01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:15.323
IT THAT. IT'S ALMOST LIKE

01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:16.992
WHOEVER IS WILLING TO SIGN UP

01:18:17.059 --> 01:18:18.427
TO OUR YOU KNOW DISTRIBUTION

01:18:18.493 --> 01:18:20.028
MAILING LIST. THEY THEY COME

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:22.130
AND WE AND WE INVITE THOSE

01:18:22.197 --> 01:18:23.799
INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER IN

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:25.534
THE DEPARTMENT TO JOIN OUR

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.702
REGULAR MEETINGS. PERCENTAGE

01:18:27.769 --> 01:18:29.204
WISE I DON'T KNOW IF WE KNOW

01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:30.439
THAT WITH OUR HEAD I WOULDN'T

01:18:30.505 --> 01:18:31.473
KNOW THAT OFF THE TOP OF MY

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:32.874
HEAD WE WOULD HAVE TO REFER TO

01:18:32.941 --> 01:18:34.142
OUR INTERNAL KIND OF DATABASE

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:35.277
THAT WE COLLATE THAT

01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:36.545
INFORMATION IN. THAT BUT I

01:18:36.611 --> 01:18:40.082
WOULD SAY IS INCONSISTENT. IT

01:18:40.148 --> 01:18:41.083
SOMETIMES IS DEPENDING ON THE

01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:43.785
NEED OR AT ON AT HAWK BASIS. BY

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:47.456
DUBBED THE INFORMATION SHARING

01:18:47.522 --> 01:18:48.023
AND STUFF AND ONLY HAS BEEN.

01:18:48.090 --> 01:18:50.859
YOU KNOW. QUITE OPEN. OKAY AND

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:52.027
THEN I ALSO HAD ASK THE AUDITOR

01:18:52.094 --> 01:18:54.096
ABOUT WHETHER THERE. AND

01:18:54.162 --> 01:18:55.263
EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT REQUIRES

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:58.166
SPECIFIC TECHNICAL EXPERTISE I

01:18:58.233 --> 01:18:58.767
WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD ADD

01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:00.969
ANYTHING TO WHAT SHE SAID.

01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:04.739
PARDON DO YOU WANT TO ADD ANY.

01:19:04.806 --> 01:19:07.776
I'D I'D BUT BE HAPPY TO AYE I

01:19:07.843 --> 01:19:08.844
WOULD JUST SAY THAT WHEN HE

01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:11.113
COMES TO IT REALLY SAID THE

01:19:11.179 --> 01:19:12.481
DEFINITION OF OVERSIGHT RAY

01:19:12.547 --> 01:19:14.683
FROM ANYWHERE TO MAKING SURE

01:19:14.749 --> 01:19:16.351
SOMEBODY AS A REPORTING THAT

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:17.886
THERE ARE COMPLIANT AND THIS

01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:21.256
AUDITOR'S HAVE POINTED OUT THAT

01:19:21.323 --> 01:19:22.190
LEVEL OVERSIGHT YOU PROBABLY DO

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:25.327
NOT NEED A- YOU KNOW SECURITY

01:19:25.393 --> 01:19:26.728
IT TECHNICAL SKILL IT SAID

01:19:26.795 --> 01:19:28.296
OTHER THAN SAY YEP YOUR WE WERE

01:19:28.363 --> 01:19:29.598
REPORTING YES WE'RE STUFF

01:19:29.664 --> 01:19:31.299
COMPLIANT. BUT IF YOU WANT TO

01:19:31.366 --> 01:19:34.002
GO DEEPER TO REALLY ASSESS WHAT

01:19:34.069 --> 01:19:34.736
THEY'RE REPORTING IS SELF

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:36.605
REPORTING IS CORRECT OR MORE

01:19:36.671 --> 01:19:38.240
IMPORTANTLY OUR GOAL OF OUR

01:19:38.306 --> 01:19:40.442
OVERSIGHT CYCLE IS NOT TO POINT

01:19:40.509 --> 01:19:42.444
THEM WHAT THEY DID NOT DO BUT

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:44.479
HELP THEM TO GET BETTER AND

01:19:44.546 --> 01:19:45.447
THAT HELP THEM TO GET BETTER

01:19:45.514 --> 01:19:46.681
THROUGH TRAINING ADVISORY

01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:48.717
SERVICE OR EVEN WHEN THEY SAY

01:19:48.783 --> 01:19:49.684
HEY WE THINK WE DO THIS BUT

01:19:49.751 --> 01:19:50.852
WHEN WE ASSESS THEY REALLY

01:19:50.919 --> 01:19:52.220
DIDN'T. WE'RE GOING TO HELP

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:53.655
THEM TO SAY THIS IS WHAT YOU

01:19:53.722 --> 01:19:55.590
NEED TO DO TO REACH THE NEXT

01:19:55.657 --> 01:19:57.459
LEVEL OF COMPLIANCE AND THAT

01:19:57.526 --> 01:19:58.894
LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT IN MY

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.196
OPINION WE REALLY BENEFIT FROM

01:20:01.263 --> 01:20:05.667
A TECHNICAL EXPERTISE. AND JUST

01:20:05.734 --> 01:20:08.670
OUT TO THAT IF I MAY SOUND.

01:20:08.737 --> 01:20:09.738
COMPLIANCE ALONE DOES NOT EQUAL

01:20:09.804 --> 01:20:10.639
SECURITY COMPLIANCE ALONE SO

01:20:10.705 --> 01:20:11.940
IT'S A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD A

01:20:12.007 --> 01:20:13.608
BASS LINE IF YOU WILL THAT

01:20:13.675 --> 01:20:14.676
THAT'S CONSISTENT ACROSS THE

01:20:14.743 --> 01:20:15.710
BOARD AND IT SHOULD BE

01:20:15.777 --> 01:20:16.711
CONSISTENT THAT'S KIND OF WHY

01:20:16.778 --> 01:20:19.548
WHY WE'RE ALL HERE TODAY IS TO

01:20:19.614 --> 01:20:20.615
KIND OF. SET THAT CONSISTENCY

01:20:20.682 --> 01:20:21.082
ACROSS JURISDICTIONAL

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:23.919
BOUNDARIES. BUT THEN WE NEED TO

01:20:23.985 --> 01:20:25.153
GO FURTHER BEYOND COMPLIANCE

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:26.388
HOW DO WE MEASURE OUR

01:20:26.454 --> 01:20:28.023
COMPLIANCE HOW DO WE MAKE SURE

01:20:28.089 --> 01:20:29.824
IT'S EFFECTIVE IT'S STAYING UP

01:20:29.891 --> 01:20:32.394
TO DATE. SO THAT'S WHAT WE ALSO

01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:33.929
TRY TO ENFORCE AND DO WITH SOME

01:20:33.995 --> 01:20:36.264
OF OUR- MILITARY DEPARTMENT

01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:37.265
INFORMATION SECURITY

01:20:37.332 --> 01:20:38.266
ASSESSMENTS ARE INDEPENDENT

01:20:38.333 --> 01:20:39.634
SECURITY ASSESSMENTS IT'S

01:20:39.701 --> 01:20:41.403
REALLY TO MEASURE. THE

01:20:41.469 --> 01:20:43.371
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CONTROLS

01:20:43.438 --> 01:20:44.406
WERE WERE IN FORCING AND

01:20:44.472 --> 01:20:46.374
OUTLINING FOR THE DEPARTMENTS.

01:20:46.441 --> 01:20:48.410
AND REALLY THE GOAL IS TO

01:20:48.476 --> 01:20:49.544
ENFORCE IT AND CONDUCT OUR

01:20:49.611 --> 01:20:52.280
PRACTICE WITH THE UNIFIED WANT

01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:52.814
ONE MEASURING STICK THAT'S

01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:57.219
THAT'S CONSISTENT. DO THINK

01:20:57.285 --> 01:20:58.386
THAT ADOPTING ONE STANDARD OVER

01:20:58.453 --> 01:21:01.990
THE OTHER WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY

01:21:02.057 --> 01:21:02.524
IMPACT THE SECURITY AT THE

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:06.995
STATE. THE QUESTION OF A LIKE A

01:21:07.062 --> 01:21:08.230
TOP IN ONE OF THE THREE

01:21:08.296 --> 01:21:09.497
STANDARDS OR THE OTHER OR

01:21:09.564 --> 01:21:10.865
HAVING A CONSISTENT STANDARD

01:21:10.932 --> 01:21:13.835
WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHT ON THE-

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:14.903
THE DIFFERENT STANDARDS AND THE

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:17.138
NEEDS OF TO BE STANDARD YEAH.

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:18.840
OF ALL HAVE A TELL YOU CHIME IN

01:21:18.907 --> 01:21:20.475
I KNOW HIS OF BEEN WANTING TO

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:22.310
SPEAK TO RALPH IF I I'LL I'LL

01:21:22.377 --> 01:21:25.247
ACT ABRUPT BROADLY. THE I SO

01:21:25.313 --> 01:21:27.515
STANDARD FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S A

01:21:27.582 --> 01:21:28.950
LITTLE BIT MORE UNIVERSAL MORE

01:21:29.017 --> 01:21:31.186
GENERIC IT'S SUPPLY TYPICALLY

01:21:31.253 --> 01:21:33.154
GLOBALLY IT'S ACTUALLY RAN BY

01:21:33.221 --> 01:21:35.590
THE BY AN NGO HEADQUARTERED AND

01:21:35.657 --> 01:21:38.360
SWITZERLAND FROM THE MISTAKEN.

01:21:38.426 --> 01:21:39.461
SO WE'VE ADOPTED HERE IN

01:21:39.527 --> 01:21:41.830
CALIFORNIA IN THIS STATE

01:21:41.896 --> 01:21:42.530
HUNDRED FIFTY THREE WHICH IS

01:21:42.597 --> 01:21:44.733
THE CURRENT REVISION FOR AND WE

01:21:44.799 --> 01:21:45.634
LEVERAGE SOME OF THE SECURITY

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:47.402
CONTROLS AND SECURITY DOMAINS

01:21:47.469 --> 01:21:50.505
WITHIN OUR SAM FIFTY THREE

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:51.673
HUNDRED SO IT'S REALLY SIMILAR

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:54.109
AND THEY THEY REALLY CORRELATE

01:21:54.175 --> 01:21:56.344
TO EACH OTHER. BUT THEN THE

01:21:56.411 --> 01:21:58.213
NEXT EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THREE

01:21:58.280 --> 01:21:59.881
IS A SUPERSET IF YOU WILL. OF

01:21:59.948 --> 01:22:02.117
THE I. SO TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED

01:22:02.183 --> 01:22:03.285
OR TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND TWO

01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:04.853
STANDARD SO THEY'RE A LITTLE

01:22:04.919 --> 01:22:05.787
BIT MORE SPECIFIC FOR MORE

01:22:05.854 --> 01:22:07.889
SPECIFIC SPECIFICITY THAT'S

01:22:07.956 --> 01:22:09.357
BECAUSE THE I SO STANDARDS A

01:22:09.424 --> 01:22:11.593
LITTLE BIT MORE IT HAS TO BE

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.194
UNIVERSAL BECAUSE IT IT DOES

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:14.896
APPLY GLOBALLY SO IT DOESN'T

01:22:14.963 --> 01:22:18.433
NECESSARILY COVER EVERYTHING.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:19.968
SO WHICH IS WHY WE CHOSE TO

01:22:20.035 --> 01:22:22.170
APPLY THE NATIONAL FEDERAL A

01:22:22.237 --> 01:22:24.406
FRAMEWORK AND WITH IN

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:29.678
CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT Y. WEEK

01:22:29.744 --> 01:22:30.178
MAP THAT TO THE STATE OF

01:22:30.245 --> 01:22:34.282
CALIFORNIA. RAYMOUR BUT WE CAN.

01:22:34.349 --> 01:22:34.949
ADD OR REDUCE TO IT THAT WAY WE

01:22:35.016 --> 01:22:36.017
CAN ADD MORE SPECIFICITY TO

01:22:36.084 --> 01:22:36.618
CERTAIN CONTROLS IN THE MORE

01:22:36.685 --> 01:22:37.452
PRESCRIPTIVE. VERSUS SUBJECTIVE

01:22:37.519 --> 01:22:38.053
BECAUSE SOME OF THESE CONTROLS

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:39.354
CAN BE APPLIED DIFFERENTLY

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:40.655
WHETHER YOU'RE DOING BUSINESS.

01:22:40.722 --> 01:22:42.891
LOCALLY AND ON PREMISES WITHIN

01:22:42.957 --> 01:22:44.225
THE PHYSICAL DATA CENTER OR IN

01:22:44.292 --> 01:22:45.694
THE CLOUD OR OR VARIOUS OTHER

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.629
EXAMPLES THAT WE GET A LITTLE

01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:49.331
BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS

01:22:49.397 --> 01:22:51.266
OF GUIDING OUR- ENTITIES THAT

01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:53.068
WE OVERSEE INTO. HOW YOU SHOULD

01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:55.970
DEPLOY A PARTICULAR STANDARD.

01:22:56.037 --> 01:22:57.372
RIGHT SO IT YOU KNOW TO ADD ON

01:22:57.439 --> 01:23:00.075
WHAT BATALI SAME BASICALLY OUR

01:23:00.141 --> 01:23:01.843
PREFERENCE IS TO HAVE ONE SET

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:04.612
OF STANDARDS. AND THE REASON IS

01:23:04.679 --> 01:23:06.381
AGAIN YOU KNOW ADOPTING ONCE

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:08.183
AND SETS OF STANDARDS NOT ONLY

01:23:08.249 --> 01:23:09.451
SOLELY FOR THE FACT THAT

01:23:09.517 --> 01:23:11.052
SOMEBODY CHECK OFF THE BOX YES

01:23:11.119 --> 01:23:11.953
I'M GONNA USE THAT FOR MY

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:13.688
COMPLIANCE MEASUREMENT. BUT

01:23:13.755 --> 01:23:15.223
REALLY TO THROUGH THAT ONE SET

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:17.592
OF STANDARDS WHEN YOU COME TO A

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:19.627
COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE WORKING

01:23:19.694 --> 01:23:21.696
WITH THOSE ALREADY IN A LIMITED

01:23:21.763 --> 01:23:23.331
TECHNICAL RESOURCE. RESOURCES

01:23:23.398 --> 01:23:24.966
TO HELP RELIEVE EACH OF THE

01:23:25.033 --> 01:23:27.435
ENTITY TO MATURE IN ACHIEVING

01:23:27.502 --> 01:23:28.837
THOSE STANDARDS DO BETTER WITH

01:23:28.903 --> 01:23:31.272
IT AND DIED HAVING A STANDARD

01:23:31.339 --> 01:23:32.407
SO THAT WE CAN WORK FROM THE

01:23:32.474 --> 01:23:33.708
SAME SHEET OF MUSIC IT'S MUCH

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:35.076
BETTER THAN IF EVERYBODY'S

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:36.244
REFERRING TO A DIFFERENT SETS

01:23:36.311 --> 01:23:38.913
OF STANDARDS. SEPARATELY WHEN

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:41.716
IT COMES TO WIDE THE SAM WHICH

01:23:41.783 --> 01:23:42.951
IS THE STATE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:23:43.017 --> 01:23:44.786
MANUAL COMPARING TO THE NEST

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:45.420
UNDER WHICH IS AT THE FEDERAL

01:23:45.487 --> 01:23:48.256
LEVEL OR THE I SAW CENTER WHICH

01:23:48.323 --> 01:23:50.325
IS MORE GLOBAL. IT'S S. PATEL

01:23:50.392 --> 01:23:52.794
THE APPOINTED AL DIED THE

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:55.063
LARGER THE STANDARD IS BEING

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:57.866
CREATED. THE BROADER IT BECOMES

01:23:57.932 --> 01:23:59.934
SO THAT IN MANY CASES YOU MIGHT

01:24:00.001 --> 01:24:01.669
HAVE ITEMS THAT ARE COVERING

01:24:01.736 --> 01:24:03.371
GLOBAL NEEDS THAT NOT

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:05.073
NECESSARILY NOT VERY SPECIFIC

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:06.775
TO A STATE OPERATION. IN THE

01:24:06.841 --> 01:24:08.643
STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WHAT WE

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:11.012
DID IN FACT BACK INTO THE HOUSE

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:13.915
THE SISTINE WE ACTUALLY OF HAVE

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:16.351
THE CONTRACTED WITH GARTNER TO

01:24:16.418 --> 01:24:18.219
DO WHAT IS CALLED A STANDARD

01:24:18.286 --> 01:24:19.921
COMPARISON. LOOKING AT THE

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:21.456
ENTIRE STATE OF I STILL LOOK IN

01:24:21.523 --> 01:24:22.056
AN ENTIRE SET OF THIS STATE

01:24:22.123 --> 01:24:23.992
UNDER. IN MAPPING INTO WHAT

01:24:24.058 --> 01:24:26.294
CALIFORNIA SAM SPECIFIC

01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:27.562
STANDARD THAT WE REALLY IT'S

01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:30.031
APPLICABLES TO THE OPERATION OF

01:24:30.098 --> 01:24:31.666
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO IN

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:34.035
ORDER TO DO THAT THEN WE CAN

01:24:34.102 --> 01:24:36.438
REALLY HELP PRIORITIZE THE

01:24:36.504 --> 01:24:37.672
ALREADY LIMITED IN A RESOURCE

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:39.841
WHEN IT COMES TO MEDICATION.

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:42.110
DON'T JUST SOLVE PROBLEM BROAD

01:24:42.177 --> 01:24:44.746
BUT MAKING THEM MORE MEANINGFUL

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:47.115
AND MORE TARGETED TO ADDRESSED

01:24:47.182 --> 01:24:49.250
SO WITH THE ADOPTION OF SAM WE

01:24:49.317 --> 01:24:51.519
WERE ABLE TO GO DEEPER. AND

01:25:10.972 --> 01:25:12.307
WAS DEVELOPED INTERNALLY. AND

01:25:12.373 --> 01:25:15.643
IT WOULD BASICALLY. RIGHT THE

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:16.578
IT DOES SECURITY MADE AT THAT

01:25:23.051 --> 01:25:24.752
METRIC I KNOW THE AUDITOR SAID

01:25:24.819 --> 01:25:26.287
SOME OF THE NON REPORTING

01:25:26.354 --> 01:25:27.622
ENTITIES AREN'T READY TO DO

01:25:27.689 --> 01:25:29.491
THAT BUT IT ONCE IT GETS TO

01:25:29.557 --> 01:25:30.859
THAT POINT IS THAT SOMETHING

01:25:30.925 --> 01:25:32.660
THAT COULD BE ADOPTABLE BY

01:25:32.727 --> 01:25:35.063

AUDITOR'S ASIDE THAT THE FIRST

01:25:50.078 --> 01:25:51.246
LINE IS TO ESTABLISH A

01:25:51.312 --> 01:25:52.814
BASELINE. WHICH IS WHERE A LOT

01:25:52.881 --> 01:25:55.216
OF ORIENTED HE STARTED WITH A

01:25:55.283 --> 01:25:57.218
FEW YEARS BACK. BUT ONCE YOU

01:25:57.285 --> 01:25:59.153

GIVING HOW FAST EVERYTHING HAS

01:26:00.755 --> 01:26:02.423

OF OUR OVERSIGHT CYCLE IS TO

01:26:11.866 --> 01:26:15.003

MUCH. IF I COULD JUST FOLLOW UP

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.575
ON A COUPLE OF ISSUES THAT BEEN

01:26:20.642 --> 01:26:22.810
RAISED. ON THE ISSUE OF

01:26:22.877 --> 01:26:24.112
ADOPTION OF DIFFERENT STANDARDS

01:26:24.178 --> 01:26:25.146
AYE YOU MENTIONED ABOUT THE

01:26:25.213 --> 01:26:27.615
THREE STAND AS BEING. SAM BE

01:26:27.682 --> 01:26:31.085
MORE SPECIFIC AND THIS BEING A

01:26:31.152 --> 01:26:35.790
LITTLE MORE. I GUESS NATIONWIDE

01:26:35.857 --> 01:26:36.324
AND ALSO I S. WILL BE MORE

01:26:36.391 --> 01:26:37.792
GLOBAL. NOW DOES THE ADOPTION

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:40.895
OF SPECIFIC STANDARD IMPACT THE

01:26:40.962 --> 01:26:42.430
ISSUE OF ALL INTEROPERABLE

01:26:42.497 --> 01:26:44.465
EDDIE LET'S SAY. OF BETWEEN

01:26:44.532 --> 01:26:46.200
FOLKS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:26:46.267 --> 01:26:47.936
WHOSE RACES OF THE SEASON AND

01:26:48.002 --> 01:26:49.537
YOU KNOW SEEM EVEN SOME GLOBAL.

01:26:49.604 --> 01:26:53.474
OF SERGIO ENTITIES. AND IF NOT

01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:57.745
WHY NOT. AND IT GETS HERE FOR

01:26:57.812 --> 01:26:58.580
THE CHAMPION I DOT THE YES

01:26:58.646 --> 01:26:59.747
STOPS THE ADOPTION OF A

01:26:59.814 --> 01:27:01.583
STANDARD IS SOMETHING THAT IS

01:27:01.649 --> 01:27:03.117
MORE OF A USING WHAT TYPE OF

01:27:03.184 --> 01:27:05.520
REFERENCE GUY. THAT YOU USE AND

01:27:05.587 --> 01:27:08.056
HOW DO YOU MAKE YOURSELF BECOME

01:27:08.122 --> 01:27:09.724
COMPLIANT OR MATURE TOWARDS

01:27:09.791 --> 01:27:11.259
THAT STANDARD IS WHERE THE

01:27:11.326 --> 01:27:13.127
ARTISTS BUT SIMPLY HAVING

01:27:13.194 --> 01:27:14.696
ADOPTION OF THE STANDARD DOES

01:27:14.762 --> 01:27:16.331
NOT IN MY OPINION WOULD HAVE

01:27:16.397 --> 01:27:18.032
BEEN IN EFFECT OR IN A YOU KNOW

01:27:18.099 --> 01:27:21.369
IMPEDING THE INTER OPERABILITY.

01:27:21.436 --> 01:27:21.936
WHEN IT COMES TO INFORMATION

01:27:22.003 --> 01:27:24.906
SHARING. TO ACT IN IDEALLY

01:27:24.973 --> 01:27:26.107
SINCE WE PART PARTNER WITH SOME

01:27:26.174 --> 01:27:27.175
OF THE FEDERAL PARTNERS VIA THE

01:27:27.241 --> 01:27:29.744
MSI SACK AND VIA THE FEDERAL

01:27:29.811 --> 01:27:32.380
PARTNERS VIA THE CAL SICK. THEN

01:27:32.447 --> 01:27:34.115
THIS HAS BEEN KIND OF THE DE

01:27:34.182 --> 01:27:36.117
FACTO STANDARD WHETHER IT'S IN

01:27:36.184 --> 01:27:37.652
THIS STATE UNDER FIFTY THREE OR

01:27:37.719 --> 01:27:39.487
THE NESTS YOURSELF SO THAT THAT

01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:41.255
IS KIND OF OUR IDEAL

01:27:41.322 --> 01:27:43.658
METHODOLOGY IS TO MAP MAP.

01:27:43.725 --> 01:27:45.360
CALIFORNIA STANDARD TO THAT

01:27:45.426 --> 01:27:46.761
FRAMEWORK JUST SO WE CAN INTER

01:27:46.828 --> 01:27:48.563
OPERATE A LITTLE BIT BETTER

01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:49.964
WITH PARTNERS WITHIN THE UNITED

01:27:50.031 --> 01:27:52.667
STATES. WE HAVE NOT ADOPTED THE

01:27:52.734 --> 01:27:56.004
ISEL STANDARD. FOR MANY REASONS

01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:58.239
THE I. SO AS A STANDARD IS A

01:27:58.306 --> 01:27:59.407
LITTLE BIT MORE BROAD AND IT

01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:00.942
DOESN'T TAKE CARE OF CERTAIN I

01:28:01.009 --> 01:28:02.844
GUESS PRIVACY OR CRYPTOGRAPHY

01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:04.312
OR TRANSPARENCY ISSUES DO YOU

01:28:04.379 --> 01:28:05.780
DO TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT

01:28:05.847 --> 01:28:08.082
OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE. AND THEN

01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:09.250
SINCE THE I SO STANDARD APPLIES

01:28:09.317 --> 01:28:12.020
INTERNATIONALLY THE PROBABLY

01:28:12.086 --> 01:28:14.722
SHOULDN'T BE THE IDEAL STANDARD

01:28:14.789 --> 01:28:15.289
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:28:15.356 --> 01:28:16.057
BECAUSE WE HAVE ARE KINDA

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:19.861
UNIQUE. TRANSPARENCY AND

DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY OF THOSE

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:26.534
THE ENTITIES THAT. BEEN SURVEY

SET OF CONTRACTORS THAT DO A

01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:03.264
REALLY GREAT JOB IN DELIVERING

01:30:03.331 --> 01:30:06.434
WHAT THEY DO. IF I CAN ADD A

01:30:06.501 --> 01:30:08.369
LITTLE BIT OF STATISTIC THIS IS

01:30:08.436 --> 01:30:11.539
WERE PROVIDED BY STAFF SIDE IN

01:30:11.606 --> 01:30:13.107
THE PAST TWO YEARS THERE WAS

01:30:13.174 --> 01:30:15.143
ABOUT EIGHT AM INDEPENDENCE

01:30:15.209 --> 01:30:16.711
SECURITY ASSESSMENT THAT WAS

01:30:16.778 --> 01:30:18.446
CONDUCTED BY A PRIVATE

01:30:18.513 --> 01:30:20.982
PROVIDER. AND SEVEN OUT OF

01:30:21.048 --> 01:30:23.518
THOSE EIGHT DID NOT MEET THE

01:30:23.584 --> 01:30:24.986
CRITERIA THAT WAS JOINTLY

01:30:25.052 --> 01:30:26.587
DEVELOPED BY OUR CORE FOR

01:30:26.654 --> 01:30:29.257
ENTITY IN TERM OF MEASUREMENTS

01:30:29.323 --> 01:30:31.492
THE R. MEANINGFUL AND VALUABLE

01:30:31.559 --> 01:30:33.361
AND CAN TRULY MEASURE THE SICK

01:30:33.427 --> 01:30:35.863
THE MATURITY. I'M NOT ONLY TO

01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:39.934
COMPLIANCE SO I AM I DEAD THAT

01:30:40.001 --> 01:30:41.269
MAY BE DUE TO. YOU KNOW

01:30:41.335 --> 01:30:43.237
MULTIPLE OF REASONS I DON'T

01:30:43.304 --> 01:30:44.572
WANT TO SAY THAT'S BECAUSE OF

01:30:44.639 --> 01:30:46.974
THAT THE OUTSIDE VENDOR SERVICE

01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:47.842
IS NOT GOOD THAT'S NOT ONE

01:30:47.909 --> 01:30:49.143
THING AT ALL BUT I WOULD SAY

01:30:49.210 --> 01:30:50.812
THAT. EVEN IF THE DEPARTMENT

01:30:50.878 --> 01:30:52.213
WOULD LIKE TO USE AN OUTSIDE

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.614
PROVIDER FOR THEIR INDEPENDENCE

01:30:53.681 --> 01:30:55.016
SECURITY ASSESSMENT I WOULD

01:30:55.082 --> 01:30:56.784
REALLY ENCOURAGE TO SPEND A TO

01:30:56.851 --> 01:30:59.587
TAKE A LOOK THE PUBLISHED A

01:30:59.654 --> 01:31:01.389
SECURITY MEASURE MAIN CRITERIA

01:31:01.455 --> 01:31:02.957
SO THAT THEY COULD DO YOU KNOW.

01:31:03.024 --> 01:31:04.725
FIRST TIME AROUND THEY COULD DO

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:06.093
A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT FOR

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:07.628
THE DEPARTMENTS. AND THEN A AND

01:31:07.695 --> 01:31:09.497
THEN ANOTHER ANOTHER REASON IS

01:31:09.564 --> 01:31:11.332
COST COST EFFECTIVENESS I MEAN

01:31:11.399 --> 01:31:12.333
I'VE BEEN IN INFORMATION

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.634
SECURITY OFFICER AT THE OTHER

01:31:13.701 --> 01:31:14.869
DEPARTMENTS AND ONLY I'VE USED

THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS THIRD

01:31:17.205 --> 01:31:19.941
PARTY VENDORS. AND FOR COST

01:31:20.007 --> 01:31:21.676
EFFECTIVENESS PERSPECTIVE I

01:31:21.742 --> 01:31:23.010
AGAIN SAY THAT THE CALIFORNIA

01:31:23.077 --> 01:31:25.980
MILITARY DEPARTMENT WAS MORE

01:31:26.047 --> 01:31:28.049
MORE PROVIDED MORE VALUE FOR

01:31:28.115 --> 01:31:32.186
WHAT WHAT. WE GOT. WHAT WE PAID

01:31:32.253 --> 01:31:39.293
FOR. THANK YOU. HI I JUST. HAD

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:40.161
ONE OTHER THING IF. DID YOU DO

01:31:40.228 --> 01:31:40.628
LOOK AT THE AUDITOR'S

01:31:40.695 --> 01:31:41.395
RECOMMENDATIONS ONE OF THE

01:31:41.462 --> 01:31:43.030
THINGS THAT THE AUDITOR.
