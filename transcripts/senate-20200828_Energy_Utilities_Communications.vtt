AND I REALIZE THAT THE CPUC

00:43:30.274 --> 00:43:32.309
COULD POTENTIALLY DO THAT AND I

00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:33.811
KNOW THAT EDISON IS NOW

00:43:33.877 --> 00:43:36.814
ANSWERED IN MR- OR SENATOR-

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.850
WIENER RAISED IT BUT I WANTED

00:43:39.917 --> 00:43:42.086
TO- JUST TO CONVEY IT BECAUSE I

00:43:42.152 --> 00:43:43.954
THINK A LETTER TO THE JOURNAL

00:43:44.021 --> 00:43:46.190
IT'S GOT MAY BE NECESSARY SO

00:43:46.256 --> 00:43:48.859
THAT THE CPUC REALLY DOES

00:43:48.926 --> 00:43:51.528
UNDERSTAND OR INTENT AND I KNOW

00:43:51.595 --> 00:43:52.963
THE AUTHOR WE HAVE THE

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:54.298
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AUTHOR

00:43:54.365 --> 00:43:55.733
NOT THE AUTHOR SO THE

00:43:55.799 --> 00:43:57.034
REPRESENTATIVE MAY NOT BE ABLE

00:43:57.101 --> 00:43:58.535

WHAT WE ARE DOING IS

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:09.179
APPROPRIATE BUT I ALSO THINK IT

00:44:09.246 --> 00:44:10.647
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO EXTEND

00:44:10.714 --> 00:44:12.783
THAT NOT ONLY APPROPRIATE BUT

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:22.292

EXPRESSION WOULD CENTER ALLEN

00:51:36.693 --> 00:51:38.929
EXPRESSED BUT COMPARE THAT TO

00:51:38.995 --> 00:51:41.364
THE ESTIMATED FORTY BILLION

00:51:41.431 --> 00:51:43.533
DOLLAR HIT TO RATE PAYERS FOR

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.402
COST OF THE WILDFIRES THAT HAVE

00:51:45.469 --> 00:51:47.804
ALREADY OCCURRED. THREE BILLION

00:51:47.871 --> 00:51:48.738
DOLLARS IN THIS MEASURE IS A

00:51:48.805 --> 00:51:52.642
BARGAIN. IN TERMS OF PREPARING

00:51:52.709 --> 00:51:55.345
FOR MITIGATING THE PROBLEM. TOO

00:51:55.412 --> 00:51:56.513
OFTEN IN POLITICS WE SPEND THE

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:58.582
TIME RACING UP TO SOLVE THE

00:51:58.648 --> 00:52:00.083
PROBLEM AFTER THE AIRPLANE IS

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:01.952
AT THE BUILDING. THIS MEASURES

00:52:02.018 --> 00:52:03.854
ABOUT DOING MITIGATING MEASURES

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.922
TO AVOID THAT BEFORE IT EVER

00:52:05.989 --> 00:52:07.691
HAPPENS. THE EXACT SAME FUNDING

00:52:07.757 --> 00:52:10.494
MECHANISM COUPLE OF OTHER

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.529
ARGUMENTS I WANT TO JUST

00:52:12.596 --> 00:52:13.163
ADDRESS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:15.098
QUESTIONS. ONE OF THE CONCERNS

00:52:15.165 --> 00:52:18.168
ME AT LEAST SO. IS TO REMIND

00:52:18.235 --> 00:52:19.636
FOLKS THAT THIS SURCHARGE IN

00:52:19.703 --> 00:52:22.772
THIS MEASURE. EXTEND THE IS NOT

00:52:22.839 --> 00:52:23.974
APPLIED TO QUALIFYING LOW

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:25.408
INCOME CUSTOMERS A CUSTOMER'S

00:52:25.475 --> 00:52:26.843
YORKSHIRE CITIES FOR MEDICAL

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:29.713
NEEDS. BUT ARGUMENT IS OF THIS

00:52:29.779 --> 00:52:33.517
HURTS LOW INCOME FOLKS NOT TRUE.

00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:35.886
SAME MECHANISM THAT THE SENATOR

00:52:35.952 --> 00:52:36.887
DODD AND OTHERS HAD WORKED ON

00:52:36.953 --> 00:52:39.890
LAST YEAR IN TEN FIFTY FOUR

00:52:39.956 --> 00:52:42.025
EXACTLY APPLIED HERE EXACTLY

00:52:42.092 --> 00:52:43.793
APPLIED HERE. THE OTHER ISSUE

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:49.900
IS. THIS LARGER DYNAMIC ABOUT.

00:52:49.966 --> 00:52:51.167
THE IMPACT ON RATEPAYERS AND

00:52:51.234 --> 00:52:54.938
WHETHER OR NOT. THIS IS FAIR

00:52:55.005 --> 00:52:56.706
WELL THIS BILL SAYS AND TO

00:52:56.773 --> 00:52:58.208
AVOID ANY ISSUE I WANT TO QUOTE

00:52:58.275 --> 00:53:02.712
PAGE NINE. LINES TWENTY NINE OR

00:53:02.779 --> 00:53:03.280
TWENTY EIGHT THROUGH THIRTY

00:53:03.346 --> 00:53:05.549
WHERE IT SAYS. THE MONEY SHOULD

00:53:05.615 --> 00:53:07.350
BE ALLOCATED PROPORTIONALLY

00:53:07.417 --> 00:53:09.085
WITHIN THE SERVICE AREA OF THE

00:53:09.152 --> 00:53:11.388
LARGE ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS

00:53:11.454 --> 00:53:12.789
AND EXCLUSIVELY WITHIN THE

00:53:12.856 --> 00:53:13.924
SERVICE AREA WITHIN THESE

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:16.293
AREAS. IT'S THAT'S ONE

00:53:16.359 --> 00:53:18.662
REFERENCES ANOTHER REFERENCE ON

00:53:18.728 --> 00:53:20.497
PAGE TWENTY LINE TWENTY NINE.

00:53:20.564 --> 00:53:23.099
THE POINT IS THAT IF THIS IS

00:53:23.166 --> 00:53:25.669
RATEPAYER MONEY. THE RATEPAYER

00:53:25.735 --> 00:53:28.872
MONEY IS TO BE UTILIZED ONLY IN

00:53:28.939 --> 00:53:30.574
RATE SO SAN DIEGO AT SAN

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.009
DIEGO'S MONEY P. JEANNIE IT'S

00:53:33.076 --> 00:53:35.045
MONEY AND EDISON IT'S MONEY TO

00:53:35.111 --> 00:53:35.979
BE ABLE TO MITIGATE THESE

00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:38.014
CHALLENGES WITH THESE FIRES ARE

00:53:38.081 --> 00:53:41.117
SO. AND CLIMATECHANGE AND THE

00:53:41.184 --> 00:53:43.486
NUMBER OF LIGHTNING STRIKES IN

00:53:43.553 --> 00:53:44.654
THE IMPACT YOU KNOW SOMEONE

00:53:44.721 --> 00:53:46.723
ARGUES WELL THESE WERE CAUSED

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:47.958
BY LIGHTNING STRIKES WELL LET'S

00:53:48.024 --> 00:53:49.192
ASSUME THAT. THE LIGHTNING

00:53:49.259 --> 00:53:50.594
STRIKES THEN CAUSED A SPARK IN

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:52.395
THE TRANSFORMER AND YOU CAN'T

00:53:52.462 --> 00:53:54.030
MAKE A DETERMINATION. WE'RE

00:53:54.097 --> 00:53:57.734
TRYING TO MARY WHAT WE DID LAST

00:53:57.801 --> 00:53:59.669
YEAR TEN FIFTY FOUR. WITH A

00:53:59.736 --> 00:54:02.005
VERY ELEGANT APPROACH IN TERMS

00:54:02.072 --> 00:54:03.740
OF WHAT CENTER ISLAND SENATORS

00:54:03.807 --> 00:54:05.709
STARTED. SEVERAL MULLIN

00:54:05.775 --> 00:54:08.011
ASSEMBLY MEMBER C.

00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:09.512
ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM. EVERYBODY

00:54:09.579 --> 00:54:12.015
SPENT WELL OVER TWO YEARS

00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:13.283
NEGOTIATING OF COURSE ARE. THE

00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:17.020
STEAM. ORTHODOX MEMBER OVER

00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:18.755
THERE SENATOR STERN BEGAN WHO

00:54:18.822 --> 00:54:21.191
WORK SO HARD ON THIS TO TRY TO

00:54:21.257 --> 00:54:23.059
MARRY THESE TWO CONCEPTS AT A

00:54:23.126 --> 00:54:25.795
TIME WHEN WE'RE FACING SUCH A

00:54:25.862 --> 00:54:27.831
CRISIS WHERE WE HAVE SPENT

00:54:27.897 --> 00:54:29.766
YEARS WORKING LITERALLY ON THE

00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:31.468
FRAMEWORK OF THE FINANCIAL

00:54:31.534 --> 00:54:33.503
PIECE AND YEARS WORKING ON AND

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:35.972
PULLING OUT OF THE THOSE BOND

00:54:36.039 --> 00:54:37.007
MEASURES THAT WE'RE GONNA GO ON

00:54:37.073 --> 00:54:38.074
THE BALLOT OR SOME DISCUSSION

00:54:38.141 --> 00:54:40.276
IN THE ANALYSIS ABOUT BONDS BUT

00:54:40.343 --> 00:54:41.778
THIS ISN'T BONDS THIS IS RARE

00:54:41.845 --> 00:54:43.847
MONEY. REDUCING THEIR RISK

00:54:43.913 --> 00:54:47.984
PROFILE IN THIS REGARD. AND THE

00:54:48.051 --> 00:54:50.754
ARGUMENT THAT I'VE HEARD FROM.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:52.956
I GET IT I SAW. US ONE OF THE

00:54:53.023 --> 00:54:55.058
SENATORS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:54:55.125 --> 00:54:55.592
TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT AND

00:54:55.659 --> 00:54:57.494
REPAIRS HE'S RIGHT. LARGE

00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.629
REPAIRS THEY PAY MOE. WE HAVE

00:54:59.696 --> 00:55:01.364
OBSERVED JURISPRUDENTIAL MATTER

00:55:01.431 --> 00:55:02.699
MAY DETERMINATION THAT POOR

00:55:02.766 --> 00:55:05.835
PEOPLE PAY LESS. RESIDENTIAL'S

00:55:05.902 --> 00:55:06.936
PAY SOME PORTION AND

00:55:07.003 --> 00:55:10.040
COMMERCIALS PAY MORE THAT HAS

00:55:10.106 --> 00:55:10.640
BEEN SOMETHING THAT THIS BODY

00:55:10.707 --> 00:55:11.474
HAS DIED IN THIS GOVERNMENT HAS

00:55:11.541 --> 00:55:13.043
DONE FOR MANY YEARS NO QUESTION

00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:16.212
ABOUT IT. BUT RIGHT NOW AS WE

00:55:16.279 --> 00:55:17.847
STAND HERE TODAY THERE'S NO

00:55:17.914 --> 00:55:19.416
INCREASE IN FEES IT'S EXACTLY

00:55:19.482 --> 00:55:22.018
THE SAME FEE. THAT B. IS BEEN

00:55:22.085 --> 00:55:23.586
EXTENDED UNDER TEN FIFTY FOUR

00:55:23.653 --> 00:55:25.321
THAT CENTER DODD INCIDENT OF A

00:55:25.388 --> 00:55:27.323
SUMMER HOLDEN OTHERS NEGOTIATED

00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:29.325
UP UNTIL TWENTY THIRTY FIVE.

00:55:29.392 --> 00:55:30.994
AND THIS JUST SIMPLY EXTENDS

00:55:31.061 --> 00:55:33.096
THIS TIME FOR IT TO BE ABLE TO

00:55:33.163 --> 00:55:33.997
GET A REVENUE STREAM AND

00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:35.699
SENATOR STERN WAS JUST TALKING

00:55:35.765 --> 00:55:36.499
IS IT RELATED TO THE LAST

00:55:36.566 --> 00:55:38.234
MEASURE ABOUT HOW CHEAP MONEY

00:55:38.301 --> 00:55:39.736
AS EVERYBODY WE TALKED TO ALL

00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:41.938
THE EXPERTS SAY. NOW IS THE

00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:43.873
TIME TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS I

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:44.808
CLOSER TO PARTICULARLY

00:55:44.874 --> 00:55:47.610
IMPORTANT ELEMENTS MONEY IS THE

00:55:47.677 --> 00:55:49.279
CHEAPEST IT CAN BE. FOURTEEN

00:55:49.345 --> 00:55:50.447
BASIS POINTS ON A TWO YEAR

00:55:50.513 --> 00:55:52.015
TREASURY THAT'S LITERALLY JUST

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:52.882
A LITTLE MORE THAN A TENTH OF A

00:55:52.949 --> 00:55:56.686
PERCENT. THE COST OF MONEY IS

00:55:56.753 --> 00:55:57.854
THE LAST. AND TO. WHEN WE

00:55:57.921 --> 00:56:00.056
SPACED FORTY BILLION DOLLARS OF

00:56:00.123 --> 00:56:01.524
RISK FROM THE LAST SET OF FIRES

00:56:01.591 --> 00:56:03.493
WHAT WE SEE NOW IS THE BIGGEST

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:04.694
I THINK SENATOR DODD'S DISTRICT

00:56:04.761 --> 00:56:06.730
AS THE BIGGEST. NOW IN STATE'S

00:56:06.796 --> 00:56:09.199
HISTORY IF NOT PRETTY CLOSE. N.

00:56:09.265 --> 00:56:11.901
SHOULDN'T WE INTELLIGENTLY

00:56:11.968 --> 00:56:13.303
THINK THROUGH AND PLAN IN

00:56:13.369 --> 00:56:14.871
ADVANCE SHOULD WE LIMIT WHAT

00:56:14.938 --> 00:56:16.906
THAT RISK IS TO HELP EVERYBODY

00:56:16.973 --> 00:56:18.708
ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THIS ONLY

00:56:18.775 --> 00:56:20.810
DOES IT FOR THE SERVICE AREAS.

00:56:20.877 --> 00:56:21.911
BUT IT IS INDEED A THOUGHTFUL

00:56:21.978 --> 00:56:24.514
APPROACH. THAT IS NOT SOMETHING

00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:25.815
THAT IS LAST MINUTE BY ITS

00:56:25.882 --> 00:56:26.983
NATURE BUT IS JUST COBBLING

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:29.686
TOGETHER. WELL DEVELOPED

00:56:29.753 --> 00:56:32.922
COMPONENT PARTS. THAT INFORMED

WE'VE EVER FACED IN CALIFORNIA

00:56:36.459 --> 00:56:37.761

MERE FIFTEEN FEET AROUND THOSE

00:58:09.619 --> 00:58:11.154
POWER LINES WHEN THE VAST

MAJORITY OF THE FUEL IN THE

GROWTH BECAUSE OF DEAD TREES

00:58:31.107 --> 00:58:33.776

01:26:39.327 --> 01:26:42.330
FEET AROUND. A TREE. AND THAT'S

01:26:42.397 --> 01:26:44.399
THEIR LEVEL OF-AUTHORITY

01:26:44.465 --> 01:26:45.700
THAT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY

01:26:45.767 --> 01:26:47.302
THAT'S THE WORK THAT THEY NEED

01:26:47.368 --> 01:26:49.103
TO DO WITH THAT IMPLIES THAT.

01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:50.939

ON THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AND

01:29:28.563 --> 01:29:29.030

THISIS IT THIS IS EVEN WORSE

01:29:35.837 --> 01:29:37.972
THAN PREDATORY LENDING ANY

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:38.873
PREDATORY LENDING BILLS WE'VE

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:40.441
SEEN. COME THROUGH IN MY

01:29:40.508 --> 01:29:42.844
OPINION WE HAVE FIFTEEN YEARS

01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:45.379
OF NOT EVEN MAKING THE NEXT

01:29:45.446 --> 01:29:48.349
INTEREST PAYMENT. ON UPON. THEY

01:29:48.416 --> 01:29:49.050
WERE LOANING THE MONEY FOR

01:29:49.117 --> 01:29:52.987
RIGHT NOW AND IT'S NOT ONLY-

01:29:53.054 --> 01:29:54.088
IT'S AND IT'S ONLY A SELECT

01:29:54.155 --> 01:29:55.389
GROUP OF PEOPLE IT'S NOT WE I

01:29:55.456 --> 01:29:59.761
WAS INVOLVED IN. A AB EIGHT

01:29:59.827 --> 01:30:00.962
FIFTY NINE WHICH WAS A BIOMASS

01:30:01.028 --> 01:30:04.031
BILL. HAS A FIRE- NINE OH ONE A

01:30:04.098 --> 01:30:05.433
FEW YEARS AGO WE ALL WORK

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:07.068
TOGETHER ON IN TEN FIFTY FOUR

01:30:07.135 --> 01:30:08.603
AND I. HAVE BEEN A CHAMPION

01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:10.838
FOR- TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR

01:30:10.905 --> 01:30:13.608
WATERSHEDS IN OUR OUR WILDLIFE

01:30:13.674 --> 01:30:15.843
AND SEE THESE CATASTROPHIC

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:17.979
FIRES BURNED. AND BUDGET TO

01:30:18.045 --> 01:30:20.047
NARROW THIS BILL DOWN TO THREE

01:30:20.114 --> 01:30:22.049
UTILITIES THREE I USE WHERE'S

01:30:22.116 --> 01:30:22.784
THE- WHERE'S THE PUBLIC

01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:24.719
UTILITIES WHERE'S THE- WHERE'S

01:30:24.786 --> 01:30:25.787
THE NEW NEEDS AND ALL THE OTHER

01:30:25.853 --> 01:30:27.488
ONES THAT. ARE GETTING A

01:30:27.555 --> 01:30:30.158
BENEFIT FROM. THE RESOURCES

01:30:30.224 --> 01:30:31.859
BEING MANAGED AS WELL AND SO

01:30:31.926 --> 01:30:32.727
IT'S REALLY JUST NARROW IT DOWN

01:30:32.794 --> 01:30:34.762
TO. THE THREE ITEMS SO THAT I

01:30:34.829 --> 01:30:37.064
THINK THAT'S- VERY DIFFICULT I

01:30:37.131 --> 01:30:38.533
LOOK AT THE BILL THERE'S A

01:30:38.599 --> 01:30:40.034
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR.

01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:42.003
THE FRYING CAN NOW. I DON'T

01:30:42.069 --> 01:30:43.905
KNOW IF THAT'S JUST SUPPORT OR

01:30:43.971 --> 01:30:45.473
OR THAT'S THE NAME ABILITY BILL

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:47.141
TO GET A BOAT SOMEWHERE. BUT

01:30:47.208 --> 01:30:48.242
THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF IN THIS

01:30:48.309 --> 01:30:49.644
BILL THAT DOESN'T REALLY ADD UP

01:30:49.710 --> 01:30:52.580
TO WILDFIRE SO THOSE ARE A

01:30:52.647 --> 01:30:53.881
COUPLE OF FIRST. QUESTIONS THAT

01:30:53.948 --> 01:30:54.882
I HAVE. THAT I YOU KNOW THIS IS

01:30:54.949 --> 01:30:57.285
A I THINK IT. THE BILL THAT

01:30:57.351 --> 01:30:58.853
REALLY NEEDS A LOT MORE TIME

01:30:58.920 --> 01:30:59.954
THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE

01:31:00.021 --> 01:31:02.290
PAST. AS IN THIS SESSION AND I

01:31:02.356 --> 01:31:03.858
KNOW THAT- WE HAVE FIRES

01:31:03.925 --> 01:31:05.459
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THE WERE

01:31:05.526 --> 01:31:06.260
WERE BURNING DOWN IS

01:31:06.327 --> 01:31:08.329
UNPRECEDENTED. BUT IS THIS

01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:10.064
REALLY THE ROUTE WE WANT TO GO

01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:12.133
IT'S REALLY THAT. THE YOU KNOW

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:14.135
THE FOLKS OF CALIFORNIA

01:31:14.202 --> 01:31:16.504
EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA'S IS.

01:31:16.571 --> 01:31:19.207
LIABLE FOR. THE ENVIRONMENT

01:31:19.273 --> 01:31:20.908
THAT IS INCIDENTS SUCH DISARRAY

01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:22.844
FOR LACK OF MANAGEMENT FOR.

01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:25.680
OVER THE LAST. SIXTY YEARS O

01:31:25.746 --> 01:31:27.381
FOR ME IT'S LIKE WE'RE PICKING

01:31:27.448 --> 01:31:28.649
OUT ONE SECTOR THAT'S REALLY

01:31:28.716 --> 01:31:30.284
EASY TO- YOU KNOW YEAH THEY DO

01:31:30.351 --> 01:31:31.886
CAUSE SOME FIRES BUT ONLY ONE

01:31:31.953 --> 01:31:33.888
OUT OF TEN FIRES. ARE CAUSED BY

01:31:33.955 --> 01:31:35.790
UTILITIES WE KNOW THAT FOR A

01:31:35.857 --> 01:31:37.925
FACT SO. THOSE ARE A FEW OTHER

01:31:37.992 --> 01:31:40.795
QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO HAVE

01:31:40.862 --> 01:31:43.631
ADDRESSED IF YOU MAY. AS

01:31:43.698 --> 01:31:47.401
CENTERS YOU WANT FOR THAT JIM.

01:31:47.468 --> 01:31:49.103
BUT THE EASY EXAMPLES DOT WOULD

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:52.640
BE THIS. YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:31:52.707 --> 01:31:54.709
AUTHORS AND OTHER AUTHORS IN A

01:31:54.775 --> 01:31:55.309
LOT OF FOLKS TO SPEND A LOT OF

01:31:55.376 --> 01:31:58.746
TIME. ONE THING THAT'S CLEAR IS

01:31:58.813 --> 01:31:59.313
THAT BARRING MONEY HAS NEVER

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:02.116
BEEN CHEAPER. SO LET'S ASSUME

01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:05.453
YOU COULD ESTABLISH A LOAN FOR

01:32:05.519 --> 01:32:08.556
YOUR HOME. AND INSTEAD OF

01:32:08.623 --> 01:32:09.857
PAYING 5% INTEREST YOU COULD

01:32:09.924 --> 01:32:12.860
PAY A HALF A PERCENT INTEREST

01:32:12.927 --> 01:32:14.629
BUT YOU PAID IT ALL AT THE END

01:32:14.695 --> 01:32:16.397
INSTEAD OF AT THE BEGINNING.

01:32:16.464 --> 01:32:18.332
THE TEST IS WHETHER IT'S A

01:32:18.399 --> 01:32:19.867
GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND TO THE

01:32:19.934 --> 01:32:21.903
FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE

01:32:21.969 --> 01:32:24.805
TAXPAYERS. OF ANY KIND OF OTHER

01:32:24.872 --> 01:32:26.440
BORROWING THE TEST WHEN YOU

01:32:26.507 --> 01:32:28.242
LOOK AT THE ISSUE THAT YOU TALK

01:32:28.309 --> 01:32:30.645
ABOUT A PREDATORY LENDING. IS

01:32:30.711 --> 01:32:32.847
WHAT'S THE ULTIMATE COST.

01:32:32.914 --> 01:32:34.815
WHAT'S THE ULTIMATE COST AND

01:32:34.882 --> 01:32:36.550
THE REALITY IS FROM ALL THE

01:32:36.617 --> 01:32:38.219
BEST EXPERTS THAT WE CAN FIND

01:32:38.286 --> 01:32:38.986
FROM ALL THE VARIOUS

01:32:39.053 --> 01:32:40.488
INSTITUTIONS WITH WHOM WE HAVE

01:32:40.554 --> 01:32:42.056
CONSULTED. AND ALL OF THE

01:32:42.123 --> 01:32:44.325
VARIOUS FOLKS SENATOR A SENATOR

01:32:44.392 --> 01:32:46.694
BLOOM AND MULLIN OTHERS AS YOU

01:32:46.761 --> 01:32:48.696
KNOW IS THAT MONEY NEVER

01:32:48.763 --> 01:32:50.564
CHEAPER AS I SAID EARLIER. IT'S

01:32:50.631 --> 01:32:52.233
LITERALLY ALMOST A TENTH OF A

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:54.135
PERCENT FOR TWO YEAR TREASURY.

01:32:54.201 --> 01:32:55.803
YOU CAN ESTABLISH THE PRICING

01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:58.606
NOW. WE HAVE THE NEED NOW IS

01:32:58.673 --> 01:33:00.341
THE STATE'S BURNING UP BECAUSE

01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:01.976
YOU HAVE THE NEED FOR YOUR

01:33:02.043 --> 01:33:03.778
HOUSE YOUR CAR FOR YOUR FAMILY.

01:33:03.844 --> 01:33:05.546
AND THIS IS JUST A PAYMENT

01:33:05.613 --> 01:33:07.248
STRUCTURE THAT QUITE FRANKLY.

01:33:07.315 --> 01:33:08.883
IS GOING TO BE A LOT CHEAPER

01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:10.518
THAN G. O. BONDS OR OTHER TYPES

01:33:10.584 --> 01:33:13.220
OF BONDS. THE BETTER I THE THAT

01:33:13.287 --> 01:33:15.823
WOULD BE ISSUE. SECOND THING

01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:16.991
IS. THAT WHEN YOU READ THE

01:33:17.058 --> 01:33:18.192
MEASURE ITS FIVE HUNDRED

01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:18.960
MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS

01:33:19.026 --> 01:33:20.261
BORROWED WHICH IS CONTINUOUS

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:21.762
APPROPRIATIONS FOR WORK RIGHT

01:33:21.829 --> 01:33:23.230
NOW PUT PEOPLE TO WORK DEAL

01:33:23.297 --> 01:33:24.265
WITH SOME OF THIS VERY

01:33:24.332 --> 01:33:24.966
EXTRAORDINARY REYES FROM

01:33:25.032 --> 01:33:27.134
CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THEN THERE

01:33:27.201 --> 01:33:29.070
IS THE ISSUE OF APPROPRIATION

01:33:29.136 --> 01:33:30.771
FOR THE BALANCE OF THE MONEY.

01:33:30.838 --> 01:33:31.973
THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE AN

01:33:32.039 --> 01:33:33.240
OPPORTUNITY TO SCRUB THOSE

01:33:33.307 --> 01:33:35.242
ISSUES GOING FORWARD. AND THE

01:33:35.309 --> 01:33:36.944
THIRD THING I THINK THAT GOES

01:33:37.011 --> 01:33:37.878
TO THE CORE OF WHAT YOU'RE

01:33:37.945 --> 01:33:39.246
SAYING IS THE NEXUS ISSUE AND

01:33:39.313 --> 01:33:41.315
YOUR SENATE ALL YOUR 1000%

01:33:41.382 --> 01:33:42.950
CORRECT. YOU CANNOT USE

01:33:43.017 --> 01:33:45.252
RATEPAYER MONEY FOR NON. RATE

01:33:45.319 --> 01:33:46.787
PAIR INTERESTS. BUT THE

01:33:46.854 --> 01:33:48.656
ARGUMENT IS GIVEN THE FACT THAT

01:33:48.723 --> 01:33:49.757
WE SPEND FORTY BILLION DOLLARS

01:33:49.824 --> 01:33:51.525
JUST THE LAST FEW YEARS ON ALL

01:33:51.592 --> 01:33:52.893
THIS LIABILITY ANYTHING WE CAN

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:55.363
DO. FOR THE REPAIRS TO REDUCE

01:33:55.429 --> 01:33:58.799
THAT LIABILITY WOULD BE A

01:33:58.866 --> 01:34:00.368
PRUDENT THING TO DO. CHECK A

01:34:00.434 --> 01:34:00.968
LOOK BECAUSE THE UNIX. COSTS

01:34:01.035 --> 01:34:03.504
ARE CHEAP. IT'S NOT IT'S THE

01:34:03.571 --> 01:34:04.739
IT'S THE FARTHEST THING AWAY

01:34:04.805 --> 01:34:07.041
FROM. ANYTHING YOU LOOK AT. IN

01:34:07.108 --> 01:34:11.679
THE CONTEXT OF. A OF A- A

01:34:11.746 --> 01:34:12.279
PREDATORY IN THE LAST THING I

01:34:12.346 --> 01:34:14.515
WOULD SAY IS. WE ARE IN TOUGH

01:34:14.582 --> 01:34:17.818
TIMES. AND CREATIVE FINANCING

01:34:17.885 --> 01:34:19.453
ALLOWS US TO GET THE PEOPLE TO

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:21.489
WORK GET THIS WORK DONE NOW

01:34:21.555 --> 01:34:22.690
WITHOUT PUTTING A BURDEN ON THE

01:34:22.757 --> 01:34:24.558
BUDGET WITHOUT PUTTING A BURDEN

01:34:24.625 --> 01:34:25.760
ON THE BUDGET AND ALSO BY THE

01:34:25.826 --> 01:34:29.663
WAY ZERO BURDEN ON RATEPAYERS.

01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:31.532
ARE GOING TO PAY A NICKEL A

01:34:31.599 --> 01:34:34.702
NICKEL UNTIL TWENTY THIRTY SIX

01:34:34.769 --> 01:34:35.302
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO PAY WHAT

01:34:35.369 --> 01:34:36.704
WAS UNDER TEN FIFTY FOUR NOBODY

01:34:36.771 --> 01:34:38.639
HAS ONE. MORE MONEY AND ALSO

01:34:38.706 --> 01:34:39.974
JUST TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE IF I

01:34:40.041 --> 01:34:42.009
COULD THAT TURN TALKED ABOUT

01:34:42.076 --> 01:34:45.112
AND- THE- THE A. R. P. POOR

01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:47.648

BE. IS THAT WOULD BE A NEW TAX

I PLAN ON STAYING HERE FOR A

01:36:40.227 --> 01:36:43.364
LONG TIME AND- I KNOW THAT- YOU

BORROW MONEY NOW. AT A LESS

01:36:47.935 --> 01:36:49.837
EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THE RATES ARE

01:36:49.904 --> 01:36:52.273
LOW THAT'S A THAT'S A FACT BUT

01:36:52.339 --> 01:36:53.073
WHEN YOU'RE BORROWING MONEY

MOTHER NATURE AND WE NEED TO.

NATURE HAS BEEN DOING THIS

01:49:22.455 --> 01:49:23.957
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME. IF

COST. IF THERE WILL BE A COSTS

01:53:55.361 --> 01:53:56.863
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND

01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:58.164
THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:53:58.231 --> 01:53:59.632
SHARE A FEW THOUGHTS JUST LIKE

01:53:59.699 --> 01:54:01.467
EVERYONE ELSE I THOUGHT WE'D

01:54:01.534 --> 01:54:04.103
SEEN IT ALL- I WAS UP HERE TWO

01:54:04.170 --> 01:54:05.138
WEEKS AGO WHEN THE LIGHTNING

01:54:05.205 --> 01:54:07.240
STORMS HERE TODAY. I'VE BEEN IN

01:54:07.307 --> 01:54:09.475
A LOT OF LIGHTNING STORMS BUT

01:54:09.542 --> 01:54:11.444
THAT WAS LIKE A WAR ZONE AND IT

01:54:11.511 --> 01:54:12.512
MADE YOU WONDER YOU KNOW WHAT

01:54:12.579 --> 01:54:15.648
ELSE COULD HAPPEN TO THE STATE-

01:54:15.715 --> 01:54:17.050
YOU KNOW WE'RE PROBABLY OVERDUE

01:54:17.116 --> 01:54:18.151
FOR A GOOD EARTHQUAKE I DON'T

01:54:18.218 --> 01:54:19.886
WANT TO SAY IT BUT IT. MIGHT

01:54:19.953 --> 01:54:20.753
YOU KNOW SIX THREE TO TWELVE

01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:22.121
CERTAINLY HAD. SOME INTERESTING

01:54:22.188 --> 01:54:24.724
ISSUES BUT- THIS IDEA OF

01:54:24.791 --> 01:54:28.795
BORROWING- AT A VERY LOW RATE.

01:54:28.861 --> 01:54:31.164
IS A VERY STRONG ARGUMENT.

01:54:31.231 --> 01:54:35.268
UNLESS UNLESS WE- HAVE

01:54:35.335 --> 01:54:36.869
DEFLATION. AND WE FIND

01:54:36.936 --> 01:54:42.609
OURSELVES. BAYING WHERE THE

01:54:42.675 --> 01:54:47.046
MORE EXPENSIVE DOLLARS. ALONE

01:54:47.113 --> 01:54:49.115
IN THE FUTURE IT DIDN'T DIDN'T

01:54:49.182 --> 01:54:50.683
IT WILL HAVE BACKFIRED ON US

01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:52.885
AND I HAVE NOTHEARD THIS

01:54:52.952 --> 01:54:55.888
LEGISLATURE TALK ABOUT AS MUCH

01:54:55.955 --> 01:54:58.291
DEBT AS WE HAVE IN THE LAST FEW

01:54:58.358 --> 01:55:01.261
MONTHS AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:55:01.327 --> 01:55:03.096
ASKING EMPLOYEES TO CUT THEIR

01:55:03.162 --> 01:55:05.398
PAY BUT ALL WE DID WAS GIVE

01:55:05.465 --> 01:55:07.033
THEM FOR LOS THAT THEY CAN

01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:08.268
BANKS AND THEY COULD CASH OUT

01:55:08.334 --> 01:55:10.436
LATER THAT'S BORROWING WE TOLD

01:55:10.503 --> 01:55:12.839
THEM THAT. THEY DON'T HAVE TO

01:55:12.905 --> 01:55:14.741
PAY INTO THEIR PAST ARE OTHER

01:55:14.807 --> 01:55:17.543
POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. THE

01:55:17.610 --> 01:55:20.313
BEST STATS ANOTHER. INCREASING

01:55:20.380 --> 01:55:23.116
DEBT THAT'S CLOSE TO. NINETY

01:55:23.182 --> 01:55:24.951
BILLION DOLLARS IT JUST WE'RE

01:55:25.018 --> 01:55:26.586
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. HAVING

01:55:26.653 --> 01:55:29.088
CORPORATIONS PREPAY THEIR-

01:55:29.155 --> 01:55:32.325
INCOME TAXES- IN IN SORT OF A

01:55:32.392 --> 01:55:34.794
CERTIFICATE IDEA. WE'RE

01:55:34.861 --> 01:55:36.162
BOUNCING AROUND SO MANY IDEAS

01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:39.198
ON ON DECK AND WE NEED TO STEP

01:55:39.265 --> 01:55:40.066
BACK AND LOOK AT WHAT IS

01:55:40.133 --> 01:55:43.403
CALIFORNIA DONE TO TRY TO

01:55:43.469 --> 01:55:45.438
ELECTRIFY. THIS STATE AND WE'VE

01:55:45.505 --> 01:55:47.140
DONE SOME THINGS IN RESPONSE TO

01:55:47.206 --> 01:55:48.875
CLIMATE CHANGE WE'RE TRYING I

01:55:48.941 --> 01:55:50.910
APPRECIATE BUT WITH THE

01:55:50.977 --> 01:55:53.012
STATE'S. HYDRO AND NUCLEAR ARE

01:55:53.079 --> 01:55:55.081
NOT RENEWABLE AND THEN THE

01:55:55.148 --> 01:55:59.552
FORCE WIND. SOLAR MERA FARMS-

01:55:59.619 --> 01:56:01.821
WHICH ARE. YOU KNOW I WON'T

01:56:01.888 --> 01:56:04.223
EVEN GO DOWN THAT ROAD- AND

01:56:04.290 --> 01:56:06.092
THEN THE IN FORM THE I. O. USE

01:56:06.159 --> 01:56:07.093
THAT THEY'VE GOT TO DO ALL

01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:08.828
THESE THINGS. AND THEN WHAT DO

01:56:08.895 --> 01:56:10.096
THEY DO THEY DEFERRED

01:56:10.163 --> 01:56:12.398
MAINTENANCE STATE WHAT WHAT

01:56:12.465 --> 01:56:14.400
ELSE IS THERE BEING A YANKEES

01:56:14.467 --> 01:56:17.770
AND BACK AND FORTH AND THAT

01:56:17.837 --> 01:56:19.772
GIVES US THESE. TRANSMISSION

01:56:19.839 --> 01:56:21.741
LINES THAT ARE NOW OLD FREIGHT

01:56:21.808 --> 01:56:23.676
AND NEED TO BE REPAIRED SO I

01:56:23.743 --> 01:56:25.311
WOULD SAY THAT SACRAMENTO HAS

01:56:25.378 --> 01:56:27.580
NOT BEEN PROACTIVE IT HAS A

01:56:27.647 --> 01:56:32.051
LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE. AND

01:56:32.118 --> 01:56:34.787
EXIST. SURE THIS BILL IS REACT.

01:56:34.854 --> 01:56:36.989
AND IS ARE. DO THIS ACKERMAN

01:56:37.056 --> 01:56:39.726
LACK OF. IT'S A LITTLE. BECAUSE

01:56:39.792 --> 01:56:41.928
CONSTANTLY YANKING I KNOW YOU

01:56:41.994 --> 01:56:43.396
WITH A J. AROUND THE ONE THIS

01:56:43.463 --> 01:56:46.299
WAY. AND THAT WAY ALL ITS- IS

01:56:46.366 --> 01:56:48.868
THAT CENTRO PLANNING IS A JOKE

01:56:48.935 --> 01:56:50.203
A SAD JOKE SO NOW THE SOLUTION

01:56:50.269 --> 01:56:51.804
IS X. SIR SEARCH. WHICH IS

01:56:51.871 --> 01:56:52.805
TANTAMOUNT TO ATTACK INCREASE

01:56:52.872 --> 01:56:54.273
IN THAT IS NOT THE KIND OF

01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:55.575
ANSWER WE SHOULD BE GIVING TO

01:56:55.641 --> 01:56:59.445
OUR CONSTITUENTS. THIS IS NOT A

01:56:59.512 --> 01:57:01.147
BILL. IT WOULD SEEM MORE

01:57:01.214 --> 01:57:02.115
REASONABLE TO PREPARE A

01:57:02.181 --> 01:57:04.550
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DROPPING OR

01:57:04.617 --> 01:57:06.486
MAYBE POSTPONING CERTAIN

01:57:06.552 --> 01:57:09.088
IDEOLOGIES AND RUN ARE YOU USED

01:57:09.155 --> 01:57:10.289
TO LIKE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

01:57:10.356 --> 01:57:12.725
RUN. WITHOUT CONSTANTLY WHICH

01:57:12.792 --> 01:57:15.061
SIGN WHAT SHOULD BE. AND SHOULD

01:57:15.128 --> 01:57:16.863
HAVE BEEN A REASONABLE AND

01:57:16.929 --> 01:57:18.765
REALISTIC PROCESS TO PROPERLY

01:57:18.831 --> 01:57:21.834
ELECTRIFY. CALIFORNIA IN AND

01:57:21.901 --> 01:57:23.803
FOR THOSE REASONS AND MORE I AM

01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:25.805
OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THANK YOU

01:57:25.872 --> 01:57:28.875
MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU- CENTER

01:57:28.941 --> 01:57:31.310
MORLOCK- FOR MY OWN COMMENTS

01:57:31.377 --> 01:57:34.013
FIRST OF ALL. I AGREE THAT WE

01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:35.047
NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO COMBAT

01:57:35.114 --> 01:57:37.083
WILDFIRES I THINK IT IS WITH IT

01:57:37.150 --> 01:57:39.352
IS A GROWING PROBLEM. AND I

01:57:39.419 --> 01:57:41.821
WANT TO THANK CENTER HERTZBERG

01:57:41.888 --> 01:57:43.856
CENTER ALAN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:57:43.923 --> 01:57:45.858
BLOOM. FROM EARLY TRYING TO

01:57:45.925 --> 01:57:47.727
IRON OUT. THIS PROBLEM WORKING

01:57:47.794 --> 01:57:49.328
ON AND I REALLY REALLY BELIEVE

01:57:49.395 --> 01:57:51.631
YOU SHOULD BE COMMENDED. FOR

01:57:51.697 --> 01:57:52.965
YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS AND YOUR

01:57:53.032 --> 01:57:54.700
PASSION. HARD WORK ON THIS

01:57:54.767 --> 01:57:57.470
ISSUE AND- TRYING TO BRING AT

01:57:57.537 --> 01:57:58.070
LEAST SOMETHING FORWARD THAT

01:57:58.137 --> 01:58:01.841
WILL HELP- WITH BUT FIRE SHOULD.

01:58:01.908 --> 01:58:03.776
I JUST HAVE. AN ENORMOUS

01:58:03.843 --> 01:58:05.411
PROBLEM FOR YOU FOR USING

01:58:05.478 --> 01:58:08.181
RATEPAYER FUNDS TO CREATE A

01:58:08.247 --> 01:58:09.515
FIREFIGHTING PROGRAM THE STATE

01:58:09.582 --> 01:58:12.585
I THINK WE COULD. DEFINITELY

01:58:12.652 --> 01:58:13.786
GENERATE THOSE FUNDS FROM OTHER

01:58:13.853 --> 01:58:14.954
SOURCES AND I THINK WOULD BE

01:58:15.021 --> 01:58:16.956
MORE PRUDENT I DON'T THINK IT

01:58:17.023 --> 01:58:18.825
WOULD EVEN BE ALLOWABLE TO USE

01:58:18.891 --> 01:58:22.395
THESE FUNDS SPECIFICALLY TO

01:58:22.462 --> 01:58:25.698
FIGHT FIRES A KNOWLEDGE EXPLAIN

01:58:25.765 --> 01:58:28.935
WHY I SAY THAT. CURRENTLY OF

01:58:29.001 --> 01:58:29.902
RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE OF

01:58:29.969 --> 01:58:31.904
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE BILLIONS OF

01:58:31.971 --> 01:58:35.074
DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

01:58:35.141 --> 01:58:35.942
NEEDS TO BE UPGRADED TO HARDEN

01:58:36.008 --> 01:58:39.212
IT. TO MAKE IT MORE RESISTANCE

01:58:39.278 --> 01:58:41.881
TO FIRES AND TO. CLIMATE CHANGE

01:58:41.948 --> 01:58:47.086
WHICH IS. INSTIGATING WINDS

01:58:47.153 --> 01:58:49.021
THAT ARE HIGHER THAN AT AND

01:58:49.088 --> 01:58:52.492
MORE VIOLENT THAN MANY OF OUR

01:58:52.558 --> 01:58:53.125
INFRASTRUCTURE EVER COULD HAVE

01:58:53.192 --> 01:58:56.462
ENVISIONED. AND SO THESE THESE

01:58:56.529 --> 01:58:58.831
FUNDS SHOULD COME FROM REPAIR

01:58:58.898 --> 01:59:00.766
FUNDS WE ALREADY HAVE A PROCESS

01:59:00.833 --> 01:59:03.703
THAT ALLOWS THAT THROUGH THE PC.

01:59:03.769 --> 01:59:06.772
AS I LOOK AT THIS BILL AND I

01:59:06.839 --> 01:59:07.573
SEE HOW THEY'RE THEY'RE ONLY

01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:12.612
FOCUSING ON YOU KNOW THE DAY-

01:59:12.678 --> 01:59:15.181
PRIVATE UTILITIES TO- FIND THIS

01:59:15.248 --> 01:59:17.617
THIS PROGRAM. YOU KNOW I REALLY

01:59:17.683 --> 01:59:20.152
THINK IT DOESN'T COVER THE

01:59:20.219 --> 01:59:22.955
STATE STRATEGICALLY. AND I

01:59:23.022 --> 01:59:24.891
UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THE PRIVATE

01:59:24.957 --> 01:59:26.859
UTILITIES COVER CALIFORNIA IT

01:59:26.926 --> 01:59:28.327
IS A LARGE SWATH BUTTER IN

01:59:28.394 --> 01:59:29.862
OTHER AREAS OUTSIDE OF THAT

01:59:29.929 --> 01:59:32.532
THEY ALSO NEED TO BE INCLUDED.

01:59:32.598 --> 01:59:34.901
IN IN A MITIGATION PROGRAM. AND

01:59:34.967 --> 01:59:36.869
THAT NEEDS TO REALLY BE FOUGHT

01:59:36.936 --> 01:59:39.238
OUT. AN END TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:59:39.305 --> 01:59:40.473
THESE REPAIR FUNDS SHOULD BE

01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:42.475
USED TO HARDEN THE GRID I

01:59:42.542 --> 01:59:44.477
SUPPORT THAT. AND IF THERE IS

01:59:44.544 --> 01:59:45.378
ANYTHING IN THIS BILL THAT WILL

01:59:45.444 --> 01:59:48.814
SUPPORT THAT I WILL SUPPORT ITIS WELL IF IT GOES OUTSIDE OF

01:59:48.881 --> 01:59:49.715
THAT I WILL NOT BECAUSE THOSE

01:59:49.782 --> 01:59:51.918
ARE AREAS. THAT SHOULD BE

01:59:51.984 --> 01:59:54.086
INVESTED IN FROM OTHER FINANCE.

01:59:54.153 --> 01:59:56.856
I ALSO WANT TO ADD. THAT IS

01:59:56.923 --> 01:59:58.457
ILLEGAL COUNTY SINCE TWO

01:59:58.524 --> 02:00:00.826
THOUSAND NINE. AND CENTER

02:00:00.893 --> 02:00:03.029
MCGUIRE I JUST WANT TO. CORRECT

02:00:03.095 --> 02:00:04.664
YOU BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE

02:00:04.730 --> 02:00:05.231
REALLY LOOKING AT THIS FROM

02:00:05.298 --> 02:00:07.567
YOUR DISTRICT. BUT IN SAN DIEGO

02:00:07.633 --> 02:00:10.202
OUR OUR OUR TRAGEDY STARTED IN

02:00:10.269 --> 02:00:11.871
TWO THOUSAND THREE. WITH THE

02:00:11.938 --> 02:00:15.374
CEDAR CREEK FIRES. AND IN TWO

02:00:15.441 --> 02:00:16.042
THOUSAND SEVEN WE HAD A FIRE IN

02:00:16.108 --> 02:00:17.843
JULIAN THAT BASICALLY DESTROYED

02:00:17.910 --> 02:00:20.179
THE ENTIRE. I WOULD SAY MID

02:00:20.246 --> 02:00:21.714
MAJOR PART OF THE OF THE JULIAN

02:00:21.781 --> 02:00:23.549
FORCE THAT HAS NOT REGENERATED

02:00:23.616 --> 02:00:26.052
SINCE THEN. I DRIVE THERE EVERY

02:00:26.118 --> 02:00:29.455
NOW AND THEN AND I HAVEN'T SEEN

02:00:29.522 --> 02:00:30.089
OF A NEW PINE TREE GROW IN THAT

02:00:30.156 --> 02:00:31.057
AREA. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:00:31.123 --> 02:00:33.059
VERY DESTRUCTIVE FIRES ARE.

02:00:33.125 --> 02:00:36.228
RAVAGING OUR FORESTS. AND BACK

02:00:36.295 --> 02:00:37.897
THEN I REMEMBER A SCIENCE TO

02:00:37.964 --> 02:00:39.732
SAY THAT THAT FORCE WOULD NEVER

02:00:39.799 --> 02:00:41.367
COME BACK AND HE WAS RIGHT. AND

02:00:41.434 --> 02:00:43.235
THAT IS OF EXTREME CONCERN IF

02:00:43.302 --> 02:00:44.437
THAT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN OTHER

02:00:44.503 --> 02:00:46.238
PARTS OF STATE I UNDERSTAND

02:00:46.305 --> 02:00:48.908
THAT. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE FOUND.%

02:00:48.975 --> 02:00:50.843
OTHER OTHER SOURCES TO FIND.

02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:51.711
TREE PLANTINGS AND OTHER

02:00:51.777 --> 02:00:53.913
PROJECTS BUT- IN SAN DIEGO WE

02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:56.616
STARTED ORG HARDENING THE GRID

02:00:56.682 --> 02:00:58.985
IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. SINCE TWO

02:00:59.051 --> 02:01:00.152
THOUSAND NINE IN SAN DIEGO

02:01:00.219 --> 02:01:02.688
RATEPAYERS HAVE SUPPORTED TWO

02:01:02.755 --> 02:01:04.023
BILLION DOLLARS OF HARDENING

02:01:04.090 --> 02:01:07.126
PROJECTS. THAT INCLUDE A

02:01:07.193 --> 02:01:08.661
WEATHER STATION THAT INCLUDE A

02:01:08.728 --> 02:01:11.564
RAPID. RESPONSE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:01:11.631 --> 02:01:13.265
THAT HAVE REALLY HELPED TO

02:01:13.332 --> 02:01:15.868
REDUCE NEW FIRES THAT COULD

02:01:15.935 --> 02:01:18.971
HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY HARMFUL.

02:01:19.038 --> 02:01:21.707
THAT TWO BILLION HAS BEEN MADE.

02:01:21.774 --> 02:01:24.076
OVER OVER A DECADE. AND HAS

02:01:24.143 --> 02:01:26.846
BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL AT

02:01:26.912 --> 02:01:27.747
MITIGATING THESE WILDFIRES

02:01:27.813 --> 02:01:29.649
THAT'S WHY WHEN I SEE THAT

02:01:29.715 --> 02:01:31.784
ADDITIONAL ADDITIONAL AMOUNT

02:01:31.851 --> 02:01:33.886
MAYBE A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE

02:01:33.953 --> 02:01:35.721
OF THREE. BILLION DOLLARS

02:01:35.788 --> 02:01:37.390
BILLION- FURTHER BURDENING

02:01:37.456 --> 02:01:39.759
RATEPAYERS IN SAN DIEGO WHEN WE

02:01:39.825 --> 02:01:41.293
HAVE A PROGRAM WE'VE HAD

02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:42.061
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:01:42.128 --> 02:01:43.295
WORKING ON FOR YEARS TO HARDEN

02:01:43.362 --> 02:01:45.831
THE GRID. YES THERE ARE MORE

02:01:45.898 --> 02:01:48.601
THINGS TO DO. AND THAT WHAT

02:01:48.668 --> 02:01:51.037
THAT PROCESS IS ALREADY ALLOWED

02:01:51.103 --> 02:01:53.906
UNDER THE P. YOU SEE AND- THE

02:01:53.973 --> 02:01:56.842
PC CAN MORE EXACTLY. ALLOW THE

02:01:56.909 --> 02:01:58.911
UTILITIES TO INVEST IN AREAS TO

02:01:58.978 --> 02:02:01.681
HARDEN THE GRID. IN WAYS THAT

02:02:01.747 --> 02:02:05.151
WILL PROTECT NOT ONLY THE RATE

02:02:05.217 --> 02:02:07.086
PAYERS BUT ALSO PROTECT. THE

02:02:07.153 --> 02:02:10.790
YOU PUT THE UTILITIES FROM OF

02:02:10.856 --> 02:02:12.324
HAVING THEIR EQUIPMENT SPARKED

02:02:12.391 --> 02:02:14.460
FIRE SO WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME

02:02:14.527 --> 02:02:16.962
THAT THIS IS ABOUT. PARTY IN

02:02:17.029 --> 02:02:18.497
THE GRID I DON'T I REALLY DON'T

02:02:18.564 --> 02:02:20.032
BY THAT BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE

02:02:20.099 --> 02:02:22.768
THAT MECHANISM ALLOWED WITHIN

02:02:22.835 --> 02:02:25.137
THE LAW THAT ALLOWS THE PUBLIC

02:02:25.204 --> 02:02:27.039
TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROP

02:02:27.106 --> 02:02:29.775
PROCESS AND SCRUTINIZE. THOSE

02:02:29.842 --> 02:02:31.844
PROPOSALS AND REALLY LOOK AT

02:02:31.911 --> 02:02:33.512
HOW MUCH MONEY IS GOING TO BE

02:02:33.579 --> 02:02:35.648
INVESTED IN HARDENING THE GRID.

02:02:35.715 --> 02:02:37.516
AND HOW MUCH IS REALLY HOW FOR

02:02:37.583 --> 02:02:39.118
HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO GO TO

02:02:39.185 --> 02:02:41.253
HELP PREVENT WILDFIRES AND

02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:44.457
DISASTERS IN OUR STATE. BUT I

02:02:44.523 --> 02:02:45.958
THINK I'VE I'VE I'VE SAID

02:02:46.025 --> 02:02:47.560
ENOUGH I HAVE A HARD TIME

02:02:47.626 --> 02:02:49.495
SUPPORTING THIS JUST BECAUSE

02:02:49.562 --> 02:02:51.430
HONESTLY I HAVEN'T REALLY HAD

02:02:51.497 --> 02:02:52.932
ENOUGH TIME TO SCRUTINIZE THIS

02:02:52.998 --> 02:02:54.366
BILL AND THIS IS A VERY

02:02:54.433 --> 02:02:56.902
COMPLICATED ISSUE BUT FROM THE

02:02:56.969 --> 02:02:58.304
STANDPOINT OF WHERE I'M COMING

02:02:58.370 --> 02:02:59.839
FROM I SEE THAT WE COULD STILL

02:02:59.905 --> 02:03:01.941
MOVE FORWARD. AND MAKE THOSE

02:03:02.007 --> 02:03:04.944
INVESTMENTS LAST YEAR WE RAISED

02:03:05.010 --> 02:03:06.812
SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION TO COMBAT

02:03:06.879 --> 02:03:08.247
WILDFIRES AND THAT WAS

02:03:08.314 --> 02:03:10.583
IMMEDIATELY THAT'S MONEY THAT

02:03:10.649 --> 02:03:13.085
IS HAS BEEN SPENT AND IS BEING

02:03:13.152 --> 02:03:16.288
SPENT TO PURCHASE EQUIPMENT TO

02:03:16.355 --> 02:03:21.360
COMBAT FIRES TWO OF. WORK ON

02:03:21.427 --> 02:03:24.196
SUPPRESSION PROJECTS THAT WILL

02:03:24.263 --> 02:03:26.232
PREVENT FIRES AND IF WE CAN

02:03:26.298 --> 02:03:27.800
WORK ON SOMETHING ELSE THAT

02:03:27.867 --> 02:03:28.934
COVERS THE ENTIRE STATE

02:03:29.001 --> 02:03:30.936
STRATEGICALLY AND LOOKS AT HOW

02:03:31.003 --> 02:03:34.874
WILDFIRE AREAS AND COMES UP

02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:35.474
WITH A STRATEGY I WILL SUPPORT

02:03:35.541 --> 02:03:38.544
IT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY I FIND

02:03:38.611 --> 02:03:40.312
MYSELF IN A TOUGH PLACE BETWEEN

02:03:40.379 --> 02:03:43.149

02:09:06.705 --> 02:09:08.207
MAYBE IT MAY BE OUTSIDE THAT

02:09:08.273 --> 02:09:09.708
FIFTEEN FOOT AREA MAY BE PART

02:09:09.775 --> 02:09:11.243
OF THE TAXPAYERS ARE NOT BUT IT

02:09:11.310 --> 02:09:13.345
AFFECTS US ALL RIGHT. WHAT IF

02:09:13.412 --> 02:09:14.847
THAT'S HAPPENING WHAT ABOUT

02:09:14.913 --> 02:09:15.981
PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK IN

02:09:16.048 --> 02:09:17.483
MARRYING THAT ISSUE WHICH IS

02:09:17.549 --> 02:09:18.450
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WE'VE BEEN

02:09:18.517 --> 02:09:19.618
TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE

02:09:19.685 --> 02:09:21.820
ECONOMIC RECOVERY ISSUE. WE'RE

02:09:21.887 --> 02:09:23.655
TRYING NOT TO PUT BURDENS ON

02:09:23.722 --> 02:09:24.590
THE STATE BUDGET WHICH THAT

02:09:24.656 --> 02:09:27.092
IMPACTS DEVELOPING DISABLED AND

02:09:27.159 --> 02:09:28.827
MENTAL HEALTH AND ALL THE OTHER

02:09:28.894 --> 02:09:30.429
EDUCATION OTHER THINGS THAT WE

02:09:30.496 --> 02:09:33.265
HAVE CHALLENGES FOR. INCOMING

02:09:33.332 --> 02:09:34.666
AND BEING CREATIVE. THE IMPACT

02:09:34.733 --> 02:09:36.635
OF THIS IS NOT UNTIL TWENTY

02:09:36.702 --> 02:09:38.670
THIRTY SIX. THERE'S NEVER BEEN

02:09:38.737 --> 02:09:40.472
A BETTER TIME TO BORROW.

02:09:40.539 --> 02:09:42.407
SENATOR BILL SENT ME A NOTE AND

02:09:42.474 --> 02:09:43.509
I THINK HE'S RIGHT IF YOU LOOK

02:09:43.575 --> 02:09:45.844
AT INFLATION FACTORS VERSUS THE

02:09:45.911 --> 02:09:47.613
ABILITY TO SET THE RATE NOW.

02:09:47.679 --> 02:09:49.481
THAT'S THE KEY WE CAN BORROW

02:09:49.548 --> 02:09:51.783
NOW AT A CHEAPER RATE. THE

02:09:51.850 --> 02:09:53.418
GOVERNMENT ARE LEGISLATURE HAS

02:09:53.485 --> 02:09:55.621
THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE. THESE

02:09:55.687 --> 02:09:57.022
OTHER ISSUES WITH THE ABILITY

02:09:57.089 --> 02:09:58.557
TO DEBATE THE ISSUE IS TO

02:09:58.624 --> 02:10:01.793
NEXUS. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. BUT

02:10:01.860 --> 02:10:04.830
WE MAKE A BIG STATEMENT. GOING

02:10:04.897 --> 02:10:06.098
FORWARD. THAT THIS REALLY ISN'T

02:10:06.165 --> 02:10:07.933
JUST MOVING THE DOLLARS I WANT

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.569
TO SHARE. IN CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:10:10.636 --> 02:10:12.204
SOME OF THE BIG RATING AGENCIES.

02:10:12.271 --> 02:10:13.038
AND WHAT THE BECAUSE I'M

02:10:13.105 --> 02:10:14.106
NERVOUS ABOUT THIS BORING I

02:10:14.173 --> 02:10:15.274
THOUGHT WAS CENTER MORE LIKE

02:10:15.340 --> 02:10:16.575
CITIES RIGHT I'M CONCERNED

02:10:16.642 --> 02:10:18.644
ABOUT WHAT HE SAID. BUT WHAT

02:10:18.710 --> 02:10:21.213
THEY TELL US AS WE FACE THIS

02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:22.714
PANDEMIC. THE FIRES AND ALL THE

02:10:22.781 --> 02:10:25.817
THINGS. THEY'RE MORE INTERESTED

02:10:25.884 --> 02:10:28.787
IS DO WE OFFER A VISION FORWARD

02:10:28.854 --> 02:10:30.756
THAN WHAT THE DEBT EQUITY RATIO

02:10:30.822 --> 02:10:32.658
IS. DO WE HAVE A PLAN AS A

02:10:32.724 --> 02:10:36.828
GOVERNMENT. TO MOVE FORWARD TO

02:10:36.895 --> 02:10:38.230
BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THESE

02:10:38.297 --> 02:10:39.331
CHALLENGES AND MITIGATE THE

02:10:39.398 --> 02:10:41.500
RISK THAT'S THE BIGGER THING

02:10:41.567 --> 02:10:43.101
WHEN THEY LOOK TO A RATING

02:10:43.168 --> 02:10:45.437
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

02:10:45.504 --> 02:10:46.638
I DO KNOW THAT WE OFTEN FACE

02:10:46.705 --> 02:10:47.973
THAT ISSUE OF THE YOU KNOW OUR

02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:49.474
DEBT RATING IN THE LIGHT. BUT

02:10:49.541 --> 02:10:50.909
I'M TELLING YOU WE HAVE VETTED

02:10:50.976 --> 02:10:53.212
THIS WITH FOLKS DEALING WITH

02:10:53.278 --> 02:10:55.113

ARGUMENT WITH RELATED

02:11:05.757 --> 02:11:08.393
TRANSPARENCY IS WRONG. BECAUSE

02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:10.229

02:11:10.295 --> 02:11:12.130
ARCTIC PIECES OF ARCHITECTURE.

02:11:12.197 --> 02:11:14.566
