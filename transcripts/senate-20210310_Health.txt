MINIMAL HEALTH CARE- ANYWAYS BUT I VOTED FOR YOUR BILL LAST YEAR HAN I APPRECIATE THE NEED FOR DIVERSITY OF DIVERSIFIER MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS BUT I'M CONCERNED THAT THE BILL DOES NOT ADD. ANY MORE SLOTS IT JUST ALLOWS FROM THE SAME SLOTS TO BE SHUFFLED BETWEEN DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND NOT JUST PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO HOW WE MIGHT EXPAND THE CAPACITY FOR MEDICAL SLOTS IN OUR MEDICAL SCHOOLS. AND. THE COMMISSION TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ZURCHER. YES TO THE CHAIR SORRY. IN ORDER THANK YOU MISTER CHURCH SERVICE THIS BILL IS TO REALLY ADDRESS IT SUBMITS BUILDING THE PIPELINE AND IT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HEALTH HEALTH HEALTH EQUITY- OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS IN ALL REGIONS OF THE STATE- THIS IS NOT SPECIFICALLY ON A- BILL THAT SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE- THE SLOTS THAT ARE ALLOCATED. AND IN MEDICAL SCHOOLS THIS IS TO BUILD THE PIPELINE EARLY ON SO THAT THEY CAN GET TO MEDICAL SCHOOL. I APPRECIATE THAT AS I DO APPRECIATE THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR THE IDEA OF.

SPECIFICALLY OROVILLE COMMUNITY CENTER URBAN POPULATION AS WELL- BUT I APPRECIATE THE BILL I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL IDEA I DO UNDERSTAND HOW IT CREATES A PIPELINE- I JUST WISH THERE WAS A WAY TO EXPAND SLOTS AS WELL.

IT'S A GREAT BILL THAT ALSO LOOKS TO SAVE MONEY TO THOSE. SEEKING TO PURSUE A MEDICAL DEGREE BECAUSE- ARE WE ALSOKNOW THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE THAT ONCE YOU RECEIVE A MEDICAL DEGREE YOU HAVE A LOT OF DEBT. AND THE WHOLEIDEA BEHIND THIS BILL IS TO.

SO WE ARE AT THIS POINT- WE AT THAT'S TEN ZERO BUT WILL PUT THE BILL ON CALL- FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT- NEXT BILL UP AXES WE HAVE CENTER DORADO. SO ITEM NUMBER TWO SB FIFTY SIX. THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO PLEASE BEGIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES I'M HERE TO PRESENT- SB FIFTY SIX A REINTRODUCTION OF- OUR HEALTH FOR ALL SENIORS HELL FOR ALL SENIORS WILL EXPAND MEDI CAL ACCESS TO APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND SENIORS. AGES SIXTY FIVE AND OVER AT OR BELOW A LINE. MAKING LESS THAN SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. I WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM IF NOT FOR THE DOCUMENTATION STATUS. DESPITE THE TREMENDOUS ADVANCES TO REDUCE THE RATE OF UNINSURED DOWN TO A HISTORIC LOW OF. SIX POINT 8% UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ACA OR COVERED CALIFORNIA. STUDIES SHOW THAT ROUGHLY 90% OF UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIA DOGS REMAIN UNINSURED. COMPARED TO JUST 10% OF ALL OTHER CALIFORNIANS IN THE SAME INCOME RANGE. OF THE NEARLY TWO POINT TWO MILLION UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ABOUT ONE AND A HALF MILLION REMAIN UNINSURED AND A ONE MILLION ARE LOW INCOME. THEY ARE SHUT OUT BECAUSE THEY WORK FOR INDUSTRIES THAT DO NOT PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE. THEY WORK AND ESSENTIAL LOW PAID INDUSTRIES LIKE FARMWORKERS ARE GOVERNMENT WORKERS. UNDER CURRENT LAW LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS ARE ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AND PREGNANCY CARE. NOT INCLUDING DOCTOR VISITS TO GET PREVENTATIVE CARE FOR CONDITIONS SUCH AS ASTHMA OR DIABETES OR HEART CONDITIONS THAT MEANS THEY RELY ON EMERGENCY ROOMS WHEN THEIR CONDITION ESCALATES TO A POINT OF CRISIS. UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS MAKE UP NEARLY 10% OF CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE AND PAY THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND LOCAL AND STATE TAXES YET THEY ARE EXCLUDED FROM ACCESSING THE LIFESAVING SAFETY NET PROGRAMS THAT THEIR TAX MONIES HELPED TO FUND. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MR BODY THIS SEVENTY SIX YEAR OLD GENTLEMAN WHO COLLECTS RECYCLABLES TO PROVIDE FOR HIM AND HIS WIFE TO SURVIVE HE CANNOT AFFORD HEALTH CARE. OR THE FATHER DUCIC GARCIA. WHO HELD OFF FROM GOING TO THE DOCTOR BECAUSE WHEN HE BROKE HIS ARM HE WAS THAT HE FEARED THE COST WOULD DEVASTATE THE FAMILIES ALREADY DIFFICULT ECONOMIC SITUATION SO INSTEAD. HE OPTED TO MAKE A HOMEMADE SPLINT IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO WORK WE SHOULD EXTEND HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO EVERYONE. I PROPOSE THE NEXT STEP SHOULD BE ARE UNDOCUMENTED SENIORS. MORE THAN HALF OF THE DOCTOR UNDOCUMENTED OR PART OF MIXED STATUS FAMILIES. UNDOCUMENTED PARENT OR GRANDPARENT CAN TAKE THE CHILD OR GRANDCHILD TO SEE A DOCTOR WHEN THEY'RE SICK BUT THE PARENT OR GRANDPARENT CANNOT DO THE SAME FOR THEMSELVES. ALMOST TWO THIRDS HAVE LIVED IN THE US FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS. OF THE FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND DEATHS LET DENOTE WHEN IN THE COLD. LATINOS ACCOUNT 4406% OF THOSE CASES AND LATINOS OVER SIXTY FIVE ACCOUNT FOR ALMOST 40% OF THE DEATHS IN THAT AGE BRACKET. SO UNDERLYING CONDITIONS SUCH AS ASTHMA AND HEART DISEASE COULD HAVE BEEN TREATED AND HELPED. AT HOME IN ONE PART OF MY DISTRICT IS LOS ANGELES LATINO RESIDENTS HAVE BECOME INFECTED WITH THE VIRUS AT MORE THAN DOUBLE THE RATE OF WHITE ROSES RESIDENTS THEY ARE NOT JUST STATISTICS. THEY ARE CALIFORNIANS THE COST OF DOING NOTHING IS GREATER THAN THE COST OF COVERAGE OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WORKS BEST WHEN ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO PREVENTATIVE TREATMENT. THE EMERGENCY PUBLIC HEALTH CARE CRISIS IS NOT GOING AWAY WHEN MORE PEOPLE FROM WEALTHY AREAS GET A VACCINATION WE MUST ADDRESS THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED AND THIS IS ONE IMPORTANT STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. WITH ME I HAVE A SEVEN GARCIA FROM TOLD ACT WHO WILL SHARE HER STORY LOSE GUY AIGLES EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR TOWER DECK WHO WILL PROVIDE TRANSLATION. AS WELL AS WELL SAID THE ORDER OF CASIO'S LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR HEALTH ACCESS TO PROVIDE PULP POLICY TESTIMONY.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST A COMMENT I WILL I WANT TO THANK THE- AUTHOR OF. THIS MEASURE FOR HER EXTRAORDINARILY EXTRA DAY ACTUALLY IN CONTINUING TO PUSH- ISSUE FOR. YOU KNOW WE WERE THE THIS ISSUE COUPLE OF YOU AGO AND THE BY COMMITTEE. WHEN WE WERE EXPE OF MEDIC CAL AND SO OF US BUT INCLUDING THIS OFF. QUESTION WHY ARE OR OR OUR. OLDEST AND MOST VULNERABLE. EXISTENCE OF THE STATE WERE LESS OUT AND CONTINUE TO BE LEFT OUT OF OUR- MEDICARE PROGRAM. ENTIRELY UNFORTUNATELY WE WERE UNSUCCESSFUL IN THAT EFFORT AT THAT TIME. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT THEN I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT NOW. ALLIES THAT WE LIVE WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET IT'S UNPREDICTABLE. AND IT'S CONSTANTLY CHALLENGED IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER- BUT THIS IS A AN ESSENTIAL ISSUE IT'S A CRITICAL ISSUE IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. AND IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED NOW. I THINK THIS IS AN EXCELLENT MEASURE I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AGAIN FOR HER EFFORTS AND I WANT TO URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU A CENTER WINNER. USING THE- THROUGH THE FIRST OF. A THIRD AS A RUBIO THANK YOU TRACK CIRCUITS OFF I THINK SO THIS FOR ALL RIGHT HOLD ON OKAY THE FIRM ACCENTS I'M JUST GONNA CALL PEOPLE'S NAMES AND TRY TO FINISH BUT- OKAY. I DID RIGHT SENATE GONZALEZ SENATE MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER TO AND I WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND MY GRATITUDE TO THE AUTHOR THANK YOU SENATOR I DID ALSO I KNOW YOU'VE WORKED VERY HARD. WITH MNY OF THE ADVOCATES THAT HAVE CALLED IN AND I WANT TO THANK THEM AS WELL ESPECIALLY LONG BEACH IMMIGRANT RIGHTS COALITION WHO HAVE- BEEN JUST REALLY PASSIONATE ON THIS ISSUE MANY OF OUR OF FAMILIES WERE UNDOCUMENTED- ARE OLDER. DOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ARE STILL WORKING MANY TIMES AND SO I THINK THIS IS A AN INCREDIBLE APPROACH TO BE ABLE TO INCLUDE THEM IN A WAY THAT IS MINDFUL ESPECIALLY DURING THIS CALL BUT NINETEEN CRISIS SO. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU AYE SENATOR BUT ALSO AND- I WOULD LOVE TO MOVE THE BILL WHEN APPROPRIATE OKAY THANK YOU- I DID SEE CENTER GROVE'S MICROPHONE GO UP SO I'M JUST GOING TO. THAT NUMBER BUT STRICTLY IN ORDER PERCENT OF GROSS. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I DO APOLOGIZE TO THE CHAIR AND TO THE AUTHOR AND I'M KIND OF BOUNCING BETWEEN COMMITTEES AND SO I DO APOLOGIZE. FOR THAT- I KNOW THEY'RE STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL BUT I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IF THE AUTHOR WOULD NOT- OBJECT TO ANSWERING THEM. THE MEDICAL PROGRAM IS A FEDERAL STATE PARTNERSHIP ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO REIMBURSEMENT- ON THE FINANCIAL SIDE. IF THE STATE DOES NOT RECEIVE THE FEDERAL FUNDING- FOR THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM ALLOWING MEDICAL. MEDICARE FOR AND DOC. INTO WILL YOUR BILL STILL REQUIRE THE STATE TO PROCEED. AS A SOLELY- FUNDED OR STATE ONLY SPEND A POGRAM. YES I AM AWARE THAT THIS WOULD BE- OUR STATE A STATE FUNDED PROGRAM NOT A FEDERAL FUNDED PROGRAM. SO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT GONNA BE APPROVED BY THE FEDS TO REIMBURSE THE STATE FOR MEDIC CAL REIMBURSEMENTS. AT THIS POINT. AT THIS POINT WE DON'T HAVE THAT AND SO WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE IT'S A STATE FUNDED PROGRAM OKAY- ARE THERE ANY OTHER STATES IN THE NATION THAT HAVE A PROGRAM SIMILAR TO THIS THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF. YOU KNOW I HAVE IN MY NOTES THAT THERE ARE- SIX OTHER STATES THAT HAVE OF FOUR CHILDREN- I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT A LIST OF WHO THEY ARE BUT I WOULD. I COULD PROVIDE THAT FOR YOU. THANK YOU I JUST HAVE A COUPLE MORE AND- IS THERE ANY DOCUMENTATION THAT YOU HAVE ON ANY OF THOSE OTHER STATES THAT ARE FINDING. CHILDREN AS THIS BILL WOULD YOUR BILL WOULD COVER ADULTS BUT THE SIX STATES THAT PROVIDE FUNDING FOR CHILDREN- DO YOU SEE ACOSTA RESERVE AN ESTIMATED COST OF WHAT THAT WOULD BE FOR THAT THE TAXPAYERS OF THE STATE'S. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. THAT IN THE OTHER STATES- THERE'S BEEN ESTIMATES HERE IN CALIFORNIA- LAST YEAR I BELIEVE IT WAS A NINETY FIVE MILLION THE FIRST YEAR- AND UPWARDS I THINK APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED. PLUS MILLION- THE FOLLOWING YEARS. IT MAY HAVE CHANGED BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC BUT- THAT'S MORE OR LESS I THINK. AND THANK YOU MA'AM AND- ARE YOU CONCERNED AT ALL IN ANY WAY THAT THE BILL IF PASSED WOULD- IF THE BILL OF PASSED TO PROVIDE UNDOCUMENTED SWITCHED OVER SIXTY FIVE WITH THIS TYPE OF BENEFITS. DO YOU SEE INDIVIDUALS COMING TO CALIFORNIA- FOR THIS BENEFIT BECAUSE IT IS A VERY GENEROUS BENEFIT. WHAT WHAT I SEE IS THAT THE PRIMARY REASON THAT IMMIGRANTS COME TO THIS COUNTRY IS EITHER BECAUSE OF. PERSECUTION RELIGIOUS POLITICAL PERSECUTION OR BECAUSE OF EXTRAORDINARY ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS- AND WHAT IT TAKES TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE THEIR COUNTRIES WHETHER IT'S- ACROSS THE OCEAN OR- A FEW COUNTRIES AWAY- IS AN EXTRAORDINARY SACRIFICE AND IT'S RISK TAKING- I HAVE NEVER KNOWN OR TALKED TO ANYONE WHO SAID THAT THEY CAME HERE BECAUSE OF OUR- HEALTH. OF COVERAGE SO I HAVE. NO REASON TO THINK THAT THIS WOULD CAUSE ANYONE TO LEAVE THEIR COUNTRIES- BECAUSE OF THIS- CARING. THE OTHER THING IS. WE'RE PAYING. JUST WITH REGARD TO THE OTHER QUESTION SENATOR ALL WE'RE PAYING RIGHT NOW FOR EMERGENCY CARE WERE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY CARE. THAT IS FAR MORE COSTLY THAN PREVENTATIVE CARE AND IT SEEMS TO ME THE SMARTEST WITH REGARDS TO- WITH REGARDS TO COST. IS THAT WE- THAT WE DO IT IN THE FRONT- AS PREVENTING NOT AT THE END WHEN IT'S ALREADY. A CRISIS AND IT COSTS SO MUCH MORE. THANK I DO UNDERSTAND THAT PEACE AND THAT'S EVIDENT WHY ALL THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE BILL IN SUPPORT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WOULD REDUCE COSTS FOR EMERGENCY ROOM CARE- I DO UNDERSTAND THAT I JUST. I HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OFFERED TO AND DOCUMENT IT'S WHEN WE HAVE SO MANY US CITIZENS THAT ARE UNEMPLOYED THAT ARE TRYING TO DO WITH EDT BENEFITS LOSS OF WAGES LOSS OF JOBS LESS BENEFITS. AND IN YOUR OWN ESTIMATE ON BASED ON THE NUMBER SHE GAVE WAS NINETY FIVE TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO COVER THIS COST. BUT I APPRECIATE YOU ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS THAT I LAID OUT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU LET'S START THERE WIENER WATCHMEN NEXT. THANK YOU- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- I'VE ON FULLY SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION WHILE SERVING IT'S- MORAL IMPERATIVE FOR US TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA HAVE ACCESS TO- TO HEALTH CARE- AND THE SENIORS YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THEY'RE COMING HERE TO HEALTHCARE THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN OUR COMMUNITY. WHO HAVE OFTEN BEEN IN OUR COMMUNITY FOR MANY MANY YEARS- YEAH WHO HAVE REESTABLISH HERE WHO HAVE. I STARTED BUSINESSES HERE WHO WORKED IN ANY PAYING TAXES AND- AND THEIR IMPROVED STATE IN A PART OF OUR STATE. THEY SIMPLY DON'T HAVE DOCUMENTS- AND I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE HEALTHCARE AND AS THE AUTHOR. INDICATED IF YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW WE'RE FORCING PEOPLE TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM- THAT IS MORE EXPENSIVE FOR TAXPAYERS AND ACTUALLY PROVIDING. PREVENTATIVE AND EARLY INTERVENTION CARE- IT IS GOOD IDEA THE A PROGRESSIVE STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA WOULD ALLOW. HI SENIORS TO LANGUISH WITHOUT HEALTH CARE IS UNCONSCIONABLE AND- WE NEED TO DO THIS I KNOW THERE'S A COSTS BUT IT IS. A WRITER'S COSTS AND I HEARD AND I DON'T. THANK YOU CENTER WIENER CENTER RUBIO AND YOUR MAXIMUM. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- I'M ALSO- CROWD TED MY NAME AS A CLOT THERE TO THIS BILL AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BEING PERSISTENT AS WELL. I AND I'LL JUST USE HER WORDS- AND THE COST OF DOING NOTHING IS MUCH GREATER. THAN TRYING TO HELP THESE VULNERABLE SENIORS GET CARE. AND AS MANY ALREADY STATED- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE GETTING PREVENTIVE CARE AND NOT HAVE TO PAY WHEN THE CRISIS IS ALREADY HERE. I BELIEVE THAT ALL SENIORS DESERVE OUR COMPASSION AND OUR CARE. AND I ALSO WANT TO REITERATE THE WORDS OF THE WITNESS ON THE PHONE WHO STATED THAT SHE GAVE HER LIFE. TO CALIFORNIA. PICKING GRAPES AND VEGETABLES TO PUT OUR OUR TABLE SO THAT WE CAN BE HEALTHY. SO I BELIEVE THAT SHE DESERVES THE SAME CARE FROM US. APPOMATTOX HERE TO READ BUT THE LOOK AT THE WHOLE OF THE ODA. AND THAT YOU'RE MEANT THEY THE OKAY COASTAL DAY ASSET NAVA IS MUST GET ON THE CABLE SO THE IDEA THAT I LIKE IN THE THEIR STATE THAT. HE MENTAL. GOING ON IN THE LEFT NO AT&amp;T ALSO. I IS THE BOB. I THE LOCAL SECTION YELLOW SAID THAT THEY SEE ALONG. YES THEM AMOUNT SAY MAY A SECOND TIME IN LOOK WE DON'T EIGHT AM. REPORT IS STILL A STORY I WILL AGREE ALSO THIS BUT OUT THOUGHT CALL ON THIS THIS THAT. HE THE LOCALS GET I GUESS. THANK YOU ARE HEARD TONIGHT WILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER IR EDMUND. THANK YOU CHAIR AND I DO LIKE TO ADD VOICE MY- HAVE ALREADY SPOKE THINKING THE AUTHOR FOR HER TO NOW. AND CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. AS WHO REPRESENTS A- LARGE. OF THAT- CENTER VALLEY. WE KNOW THE VALUE. OF A- OVER NINETEEN COULD. AND AS LONG AS WE HAVE A PASSED CITIZENS FOR P. THAT THEY WERE GOING TO HELP HERE WHO. WILL NOT BE ABLE TO. PEOPLE OF UP LARGE SEGMENT OF THEIR LIFE WORKING TO PUT FOOD ON OUR TABLE AND OUR SERVICE INDUSTRIES- TO NOT HAVE HEALTH CARE WHEN THEY'RE- AFTER OVER SIXTY FIVE JUSTICE DOES NOT FEEL LIKE A- A MORAL IMPERATIVE THAT ANY OF US WANT TO AND- EMBRACE. WE KNOW THAT PREVENTIVE CARE ISSUES AROUND THE SHE'S. PULLING YOUR LOW WAGE WORKERS AROUND DIABETES OR HEART DISEASE- CANCER ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE ELEVATED BECAUSE OF. A LOW WAGE WORKER I AM A LIFE AND SO FOR WHEN PEOPLE GET TO THAT AGE OF SIXTY FIVE TO NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE HEALTH CARE TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THOSE ISSUES THAT HAVE ACCUMULATED OVER A LIFETIME JUST FEELS WRONG SO I AM HAPPY TO BE VOTING FOR THIS AND BE A CO AUTHOR ON THIS AS WE TRY TO PROVIDE CARE TO THOSE OF US WHO NEED IT MOST THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR EGGMAN ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. OKAY SAYING NONE- SANDRA'S ONLY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. I WAS PROUD TO VOTE FOR.

MEDIAN THANK YOU. GREAT THANK VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIRMAN- I WANT TO THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL- SENATE BILL FIFTY SEVEN- WHICH WILL. AUTHORIZE THREE PILOT CITIES SAN FRANCISCO OAKLAND. AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY. TO PILOT. A SAFE CONSUMPTION SITES TO ADDRESS. THE OVERDOSE EPIDEMIC THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING. A TO HELP GET PEOPLE INTO RECOVERY. BOB MY FIRST ONE TO. NON CENTER MEN WHO HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE SINCE BEFORE I WAS EVEN THE LEGISLATURE. ANA AND SHE HAS FOUGHT THE GOOD FIGHT FOR YEARS INCLUDING GETTING THIS LEGISLATION ON TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN- WHO UNFORTUNATELY- COULD NOT SIGN A BILL- BUT WE ARE DETERMINED. TO MAKE THIS A REALITY TO ADDRESS. THESE THIS VERY VERY REAL. ONE THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY A LOCAL CONTROL BILL IT SIMPLY AUTHORIZES CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT HAVE REQUESTED TO BE IN THE BILL EACH OF THESE- SAN FRANCISCO OAKLAND L. A. COUNTY HAVE OFFICIALLY REQUESTED TO BE ON THE BILL. AN AUTHORIZING THEM TO MAKE THE DECISION LOCALLY WHETHER TO DO IT AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHERE AND SO FORTH THIS IS ABOUT LOCAL LOCAL CONTROL FOR THIS PILOT PROGRAM. FIVE SIX CONSUMPTION SITES ARE OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS. ARE PROGRAMS WHERE PEOPLE CAN USE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES- THAT- THE THAT THEY BRING WITH THEM UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF STAFF. TRAINED TO PREVENT AND TREAT OVERDOSE IS TO PREVENT HIV AND HEPATITIS INFECTION. AND TO FACILITATE ENTRY INTO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT AND OTHER SERVICES SUCH AS HOUSING. THESE SITES ARE NECESSARY INTERVENTION TO PREVENT OVERDOSE DEATHS. APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE- OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS EXIST IN TEN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. THEY HAVE BEEN RIGOROUSLY RESEARCHED AND THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWN WITH PEER REVIEWED STUDIES TO REDUCE HEALTH AND HEALTH AND SAFETY PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG USE- INCLUDING PUBLIC DRUG USE TO REDUCE OVERDOSE DEATHS. I TO REDUCE SYRINGE LETTER TO REDUCE HIV AND HEPATITIS INFECTIONS AND TO KEEP PEOPLE ALIVE. ARE THESE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS IN TEN COUNTRIES AROUND HE WORLD OPERATING MANY OF THEM FOR DECADES THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A SINGLE RECORDED OVER THOSE STAFF. EVER IN ANY OF THESE FACILITIES NOT ONE OVER DEATH COMPARE THAT TO WHAT'S HAPPENING ON OUR STREETS TODAY. THE CENTERS ALSO REDUCE EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND PARAMEDIC CALLS WE KNOW THAT IN OUR CITIES ARE EMERGENCY ROOMS ARE OFTEN OVERLOADED- COVE IT HAS SHOWN US WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LOCK HOSPITAL CAPACITY. AND THESE SITES AVOID SENDING PEOPLE TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM UNLESS IT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. BYE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN CONTRARY TO SOME OF THE VERY MELODRAMATIC CLAIMS OF SOME OF THE OPPONENTS THAT THE CENTERS DO NOT INCREASE CRIME IN THE SURROUNDING AREA. IN FACT THERE ARE SOME STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT IT DECREASES CRIME IN THE SURROUNDING AREA. THEY REDUCE SYRINGE LETTER WHICH I KNOW IN MY COMMUNITY. THAT IS A HUGE ISSUE THAT PEOPLE HAVE BILL DON'T WANNA SEE SYRINGES ON THE GROUND. AND THE SITES REDUCE SYRINGE LETTER. AT LEAST SITES HELP GET PEOPLE IN THE RECOVERY AND THAT IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL WE WANT PEOPLE TO GET THE HELP. THAT THEY NEED. WE KNOW FROM STUDIES. THAT A GOOD PERCENTAGE OF THESE OTHER PEOPLE WHO USES SITES AND UP. AND RECOVERY OR THEY AT LEAST REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF DRUGS THAT THEY ARE CONSUMING. WE ARE IN A TRUE EXPLOSION OF OVERDOSE DEATHS. FROM AND IT'S GOTTEN WORSE WITH COVERT OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS SINCE THE SHELTER IN PLACE STARTED THE DAILY RATE OF OPIOID DEATHS IN L. A. COUNTY GREW BY 58% IN SAN FRANCISCO LAST YEAR MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE DIED OF OVERDOSE DEATHS. IN OUR CITY. AND IN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE ARE ON PACE TO BREAK. THAT RECORD NUMBER OF OVERDOSE DEATHS. WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS NOT WORKING AND WE NEED TO GET OUR CITY'S TOOLS TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. WE ALSO KNOW FROM STUDIES THAT THESE OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS IN ADDITION TO SAVING LIVES SAVE MONEY AS WELL. THIS A TAXPAYER FUNDS IN TERMS OF REDUCING WHO'S GOING TO BE OUR- THE BILL REQUIRES A BEFORE CITY AUSTIN BY A VOTE OF THAT CITY COUNCIL OR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. BUT THEY MUST CONVENE AND TAKE INPUT FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT OVERCOME PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS THE BILL ALSO SUNSETS IN SIX YEARS SO WE CAN EVALUATE. THE PROGRAMS. THE ALTERNATELY WHAT THIS LEGISLATION DOES IS RECOGNIZE THAT DRUG ADDICTION IS NOT A CRIMINAL ISSUE IT'S A HEALTH ISSUE. THAT REQUIRES HEALTH INTERVENTIONS WE SHOULD PROVIDE OUR CITIES WITH ALL AVAILABLE TOOLS. TO HAVE THIS HEALTH INTERVENTIONS AND TO SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES THE BILL IS SPONSORED AND SUPPORTED BY A BROAD ARRAY OF ORGANIZATIONS. WHOSE JOB IT IS TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER- INCLUDING SOME OF OUR SPONSORS SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE. AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES AND MANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. FOR CALLING THIS IS AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTES- WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY NOT PHYSICALLY WITH ME BUT IN SPIRIT. R. I.

THANK YOU MY NAME'S DOCTOR DAVID KAHN I'M IMMEDIATE PAST PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE OR C. SAM SHORT. YOU CAN REPRESENTS OVER SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY PHYSICIANS AND ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS YOU'RE THE VOICE OF DETECTION TREATMENT WILL COST BECAUSE BOXERS OF LEGISLATION. AUTHORIZING PILOT OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS ARE- COMPETES FOR SHORT. IN MY EXPERIENCE PEOPLE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TAKE TIME TO CHANGE WE NEED TO MATCH THE AVAILABILITY OF TREATMENT SERVICES WITH THE DEMAND. THE FIRST LAST AND ENDURING TASK OF EGYPTIAN MEDICINE IS TO KEEP PEOPLE ALIVE. AS SENATOR WIENER MENTION WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF AN OVERDOSE CRISIS IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TIMES MORE PEOPLE CHAPTER CISCO DIED FROM FATAL DRUG OVERDOSE AND KOBLET. MOREOVER THESE ARE PATIENTS HAVE BEEN TREATED POORLY BY THE TRADITIONAL MEDICAL SYSTEM. I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT THE IMPACT CLINIC IN VANCOUVER. WHICH IS AN OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAM. AND I'M I RECOGNIZE THERE WAS THE SAME. MAN MAKE THAT I SAW WITH MY OWN OPIOID TREATMENT PROGRAM A METHADONE PROGRAM THAT RAN THE SAN FRANCISCO VA MEDICAL CENTER. INTERCOOLER DOES PREVENTION PROGRAMS IT'S CLEAR THEY PRODUCE PUBLIC DRUG USE YOU SEE DECREASE. IN DISCARDED SERVICE CARELESSLY DISCARDED SYRINGES. CRIME IS REDUCED. HIV AND HEPATITIS C. INFECTION RATES DECREASE. AS MENTIONED THERE BEEN MILLIONS OF USERS OBSERVE WITHIN SUCH PROGRAMS AND NOT A SINGLE OVER DOES THAT TO DATE. I MORE PEOPLE WOULD ACT THE PROGRAM SO MUCH MORE LIKE TO ENTER AND STOP USING DRUGS. MOREOVER THESE PROGRAMS REACH THE PATIENTS THAT I CANNOT AS A POSITION WORKING IN ADDICTION TREATMENT. AND OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS TREATMENT THERE'S NO CONFLICT BETWEEN SUPERVISORS SUPERVISING DRUG USE AND STOPPING TRUCKS THEY'RE PART OF THE CONTINUOUS CARE. I'M IN THE BUSINESS OF HARM REDUCTION ABSENCE APARTMENT HARBORED ACTION FOR A FIRST JOB IS TO KEEP THE PATIENT A LOT OVER THOSE PROGRAMS ARE PROBABLY PRUDENT I'VE SEEN WITH MY OWN EYES. ANCHORAGE'S SENATE HELP COMMITTEE DID TAKE AN AYE VOTE ON SB FIFTY SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU RIGHT ON TIME- LET'S THEM MOVE ON TO THAT GUY ICIN DR VICTOR ISON. WE BRING THIS AFTER NINE MANY MISTAKEN I'M I'M HERE- THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU ALL TODAY MY NAME IS THE COULD I THINK HAVE YOU HEARD IN THE CEO OF HEALTH FOR THREE SIXTY AND ALSO. ON THE BOARD OF SCAD PEOPLE TO PROCEED Y. DESTINATION DEDUCTION TREATMENT PROVIDERS WE BOTH A CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL. I'M ALSO A FORMER INJECTION HEROIN USER AND I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THE TREATMENT FIELD FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. RIGHT BUT YOU CAN TREATMENT HAS. BUT TREATMENT HAS EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS AFTER AS HEALTH CARE RETURN. AND OVERNIGHT. ACCORDING TO THE EVOLVING SCIENCE DON'T TREATMENT PREVENTION OF. WELL THE ANSWER IS THERE- LET AT DID YOU MEET YOUR- YOUR DEVICE THAT'S NOT MY LINE. MY LINE RIGHT MODERATOR CAN YOU DO YOU KNOW THIS IS WAKING. WE HAVE ISOLATED THAT LINE AND NEEDED THEM OKAY OKAY WHAT TO PLEASE CONTINUE OKAY. THANK YOU- FRIEDMAN HAS EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS S. HEALTHCARE MUST ACCORDING TO OF ALL THINGS SCIENCE AND TREATMENT IS EFFECTIVE. BUT IT'S NOT EFFECTIVE IN THE SAME WAY FOR EVERYONE FOR THOSE WHO FOR WHOM WE HAVE NOT SUCCESSFULLY REACH WE NEED TO BE WILLING TO DO SOME THINGS DIFFERENTLY. FROM A TRIP IN PERSON PROVIDER PERSPECTIVE FOCUSED PREVENTION PROGRAMS HAVE TO CRITICAL PURPOSES TO REACH THOSE WE HAVE NOT REACHED A SEPARATE TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM DYING BEFORE WE CAN REACH THEM IT'S REALLY THAT SIMPLE. BUT A LONG TIME TO BE PROVIDED WITH TV SERVICES. MISSING ELEMENT IN A CONTINUUM OF TREATMENT SERVICES TO THOSE WHO SAY WE SHOULD BE SPENDING MORE MONEY ON TREATMENT WE SAY YES WE SHOULD AND THIS IS A PART OF IT. IT IS A FALSE ECONOMY TO SAY IF WE DO ONE WE ARE NOT COMMITTED TO DOING THE OTHER. THERE'S A PREVAILING MYTHS THE PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLE WITH ADDICTION MARKET OF SO CALLED BOTTOM BEFORE THE SEQUEL COVERING WELL LET ME DEBUNK THAT MYTH FOR YOU. MANY PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLE WITH THEIR DRUG YOU STILL LIVING IN ABJECT MISERY WE CANNOT MAKE THEM MORE MISERABLE CRIMINALIZATION AND INCARCERATION. OR DEMONSTRABLY FAILED POLICY RESPONSES TO ADDICTION ONLY SLOWING OUR PRISON POPULATIONS AND DISPROPORTIONATELY AND NEGATIVELY IMPACTING BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES.

HEY MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO FURTHER PEOPLE WISHING TO COMMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE MODERATOR LET'S NOW MOVE TO COMMITTEE MEMBER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY CENTER EGGMAN NINETY SECONDS ALICE NEXT. BECAUSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRING THIS FORWARD SEEMS WHENEVER WE TALK ABOUT VULNERABLE PEOPLE WE- WE ALWAYS HOW THESE ARGUMENTS ABOUT WHO'S DESERVING AND WHO'S NOT DESERVING OF CARE AND TREATMENT- I JUST LIKE TO SAY SOMEONE WHO AUTHORED THIS FOR A WHILE. IT'S A HARM REDUCTION MEASURE RIGHT WE KNOW THAT WE KNOW PEOPLE WHO WHO HAVE SEVERE DICTIONARY ARE DEALING EVERY DAY WHICH THE SHAME AND GUILT THAT THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT. AND REACHING OUT FOR HELP. IS NOT AN EASY THING- DID WE DID A PRESS CONFERENCE AND I'LL NEVER FORGET IT WAS TWO DIFFERENT MOTHERS WHO CAME IN WITHOUT ME ASKING BUT THEY CAME IN TO TESTIFY. ON TO BE A PART OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE THEY BOTH HAD CHILDREN. WHO HAD DIED FROM OVERDOSES AND SAID THEY REALLY WISH SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAD BEEN AROUND. AS WE NEVER KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE TO TURN THAT ONE PERSON AROUND AT ONE TIME. IN THIS KIND OF THING ARE WE ALL DESERVING OF CARE AND HELP OR OR JUST SOME OF US. BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU THE ONES THAT PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS IS A MAGNET FOR. PEOPLE TO COME AND USE. THE POPULATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE. GENERALLY HOMELESS IN USING ON THE STREETS OR ELSE THEY WOULDN'T BE USING ON THE STREETS AND OVERDOSING. AND THE ONLY WAY FOR A PROGRAM LIKE THIS TO WORK IS IF YOU PUT IT WITHIN A FIVE BLOCK RADIUS OF WHERE PEOPLE ARE ALREADY ACTIVELY USING OUT ON THE STREETS. SO IT'S KIND OF A DO IT DOES NOT. IT IS NOT DROP PEOPLE YOU PLACE THEM WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE USING IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO PUT THEM IN A SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD BY A MALL WHERE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE. FOR BUSES TO GET THERE THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY AND ANY GOOD SENSE. SO WE KNOW THEY WORK WE KNOW THEY REDUCE OVERDOSES WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO USE THEM. WILL THEN AT SOME POINT GET INTO TREATMENT. I JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY AGAIN THANKING MY AT- MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO. BY SAYING THIS IS A LOCAL CONTROL ISSUE. AND JUST ON THE ON THE ONE NIGHT THAT I WAS NOT ABLE TO GET THE VOTES FOR THIS BILL I. HAD A NICE EMAIL FROM SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN LAW SCHOOL NOW BUT JUST SAID. YOU KNOW. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU I DON'T KNOW THIS BILL BUT I CAN TELLYOU. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I WAS USING I WAS LIVING ON THE STREETS AND I WAS LIVING IN MY CAR. AND TO THINK THAT SOMEBODY WOULD CARE ENOUGH ABOUT ME TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS. MEANS A LOT SO SOMETIMES JUST THE. THE PUTTING FOR SOME THAT SAYS WE YOU WE CARE OF. YOU AND WE'RE GONNA COMING BACK TO THE STATE. UNTIL WE CAN PROVIDE. THE HELP THAT YOU NEED. TO YOUR LIFE AROUND. SO I WOULD- AT ENCOURAGE MY CALL. AT TO CASTING. VOTE ON THIS AND- BILL THAT MOVES THE- ON. THAT MOVED FORWARD. ON PEOPLE REDUCE THE HARM TO THEIR BODIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER EGGMAN SAID GONZALEZ. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I TO WANT TO SEE IF YOU TO SEE AND SO. WE FO THIS ISSUE FOR IT I AM ALSO IN SO. HAVING A SEEN EVEN SITE IN- TRAVEL WHEN I WENT ANSWER- THERE APPROACH. THERE WAS REDUCE NOT ENDING DRUG USE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT BUT IT WAS ALSO THE CESSATION OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. AND ALSO REDUCING OPEN CONSUMPTION BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM DYING. OVER SERVICE THEY WOULD ALSO HELP WEAN PEOPLE OFF SYRINGES TO OR- OTHER MORE SAFE A SAFER METHODS. AND IT WAS REALLY A GOOD. EYE OPENING PRO FOR EVERYONE OF US TO A- THAT THIS IS ONE PART OF THE SOLUTION. BUT NEEDS TO COMPLEMENT THE FULL PORTFOLIO OF SOLUTIONS AS MENTIONED BY CENTER EGGMAN- INCARCERATION IS NOT THE ANSWER- AND CERTAINLY PAYING AND SPENDING CONSIDERABLE DOLLARS AN EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS. THAT COULD BE PREVENTED IS ALSO NOT THE ANSWER. I COME FROM A CITY LONG BEACH THAT ONLY HAS ONLY EIGHT HUNDRED POLICE OFFICERS TWO OF WHICH ARE QUALITY OF LIFE OFFICERS. THAT WORK ON THIS ISSUE THIS IS A CITY OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. ALONG BEACH FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS FOUR HUNDRED. MEMBERS AND ONLY TWO MEMBERS THAT WORK ON THIS ISSUE PROACTIVELY. THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT FOR OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. WE HAVE DATA FROM DECADES OF SUCCESS NOT IN CAL I'M NOT IN CALIFORNIA UNFORTUNATELY BUT FROM EUROPE IN OTHER AREAS. THAT DO A DOCUMENT SUCCESS. THE FAVORITE PART OF THIS BILL IS THAT IT IS A LOCAL COMMUNITY PROCESS AND MANY CITY COUNCILS AND SUPERVISORS ARE ACTUALLY ALREADY DOING THE WORK TO STUDY THE ISSUE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A FRUITFUL DISCUSSION AND HOPEFULLY HAVE THESE- SITES AND PROGRAMS IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY SO WITH THAT. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU ARE TO THE AUTHOR AND I AM IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SENATE ROTH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. YOU KNOW I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE THOSE FROM. VARIOUS AREAS OF THE STATE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE INCLUDING. SOME IN THE COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY THAT I'M PRIVILEGED TO REPRESENT. AND AS I RECALL WHEN THIS MEASURE CAME UP IN THE PAST AT LEAST IN THE DISTANT PAST- I HAVE TO SAY I WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO STOOD UP. TO SUPPORT IT. AND I'M NOT PARTICULARLY PROUD OF THAT BUT I HAVE TO SAY AND I'VE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT DRUG USE AND OVER DOSING- IS A CRISIS. IN THE STATE AND OF FRANKLY. IF THOSE IN THE JURISDICTIONS COVERED BY THIS BILL WANT TO STEP UP. AND TRY SOMETHING INNOVATIVE IN AN ATTEMPT TO PUT AN END TO. TERRIBLE DRUG USE AND OVERDOSING DEATHS IN OUR STATE- I'M ALL FOR IT SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU MR. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I MISS ANYONE OKAY I DON'T- ALL RIGHT SO I WOULD JUST. JUST A FEW REMARKS MYSELF- FIRST OF ALL- THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR WIENER FOR BRING THIS BILL FORWARD I LIKE US ARE ROTH WAS NOT- EXACTLY IF I THINK- SENT EGGMAN THE NEW THAT- AND- YEAH I INTRODUCED HAVE SO- SOME. DON'T BUT I ALSO POINT THAT MY CALL. TO THE ONES WHO ACTUALLY IN THIS FIELD HAVE TOLD ME THAT THERE'S TOO MANY THERE'S HAVE IN SUPPORT. OF THIS BE ABLE TO SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES WILL GAIN THEM ACCESS PEOPLE WHO NORMALLY WOULD NOT NECESSARILY SEEK HELP- BUT- WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO STILL REACH THEM OUT OF REACH OUT TO THEM WHEN THIS HAPPENS. I ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT- IN THIS BILL THIS THIS IS THREE PILOTS AND ONE OF THINGS I **** THE CHAIR IS THAT DO WE HAVE. SUPPORT FOR THIS BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AT LEAST LOCAL LAW EFORCEMENT'S NOT OPPOSE COMING OUT OPPOSED. I THINK THAT HAVING- SOME BUY IN FROM LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD THERE NOT ACTIVELY YOU KNOW. RAISING CONCERNS IT'S BEEN SOMETHING ALSO THAT'S OF IMPORTANCE FOR THE PILOT SITE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN MY MIND AND THAT IS THE CASE AND EACH OF THESE THREE PILOT SITES. SO AGAIN THIS IS A PILOT- THERE'S THREE- THERE PUT SOME IN MY FIELD OR ARGUE THAT WHY IS THIS ONLY A PILOT- THE DATA WE HAVE SO FAR IS ACTING. PRETTY GOOD SENSE OF THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURE A BUT THIS IS AT LEAST AN INITIAL STAFF AND I DO APPRECIATE- BOTH THE LEADERSHIP OF- CENTER EGGMAN AND NOW CENTER WIENER AND IN MOVING THIS FORWARD IN THREE COMMUNITIES THAT SAID WE'RE INTERESTED IN DOING THIS. WEEK BROUGHT PEOPLE TOGETHER AND WE WANT TO. WORK THIS OUT WE LOOK AT THE DATA WOULD SINCE BEEN SUCCESSFUL PLACES WE ALSO YOU CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR PLACES OUR LOCALITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THAT CERTAINLY I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS. MY I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. BUT CENTER WE DO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I THANK YOU RESEARCH I PUT. HIM AND YOU TO MICHAEL. FOR THOSE REALLY INSIGHTFUL REMARK AND- FOR KEEP AN OPEN. ON THIS ISSUE. YOU KNOW WE SOME. THAT IF YOU. IF YOU PUT A SITE LIKE THIS AND- IT'S OF LIKE. WHITE CHANGE P. AND MAKE THEM WANT TO STAY USE. DRUGS A REAL. IT'S NOT. IT'S A NINE SAN OR- WERE WITH ALL. RESPECT THIS IS A- CONDITION. PEOPLE EITHER YOU. OR THE YOU PEOPLE ARE DOING WHAT THEY'RE- AND I JOB. IS TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO TRY HELP THEM. THE HEALTH AND SIR. AND THAT MEAN RECOVERY WHERE THEY YOU ANTI AND WE ALL I'LL TELL YOU EVERY SINGLE PERSON I KNOW. WHO HAS BEEN ADDICTED. AND WHO HAS BEEN ABLE TO TRANSITION INTO RECOVERY AND STOP USING EVERY SINGLE ONE AND I KNOW A LOT OF MY COMMUNITY THIS IS NOT A RANDOM ISSUE THIS AFFECTS ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES SO DEEPLY NOT JUST HOMELESS PEOPLE FROM EVERY SECTOR OF OUR SOCIETY ARE SUFFERING EVERY SINGLE PERSON I KNOW. WHO HAS STRUGGLED. SUPPORTS US. AND IT IS OF THE PEOPLE I KNOW PERSONALLY AND I'VE TALKED TO THEM AND I TALKED ABOUT THEIR STRUGGLE AND SO MANY OF TOLD ME I WISH THAT THIS HAD EXISTED WHEN I WAS USING WHEN I WAS LIVING IN AN ELEVATOR WELL. WHEN I WAS ON A PATH TO DEATH I WISH THAT THIS HAD EXISTED WHEN I CONTRACTED HIV. FROM SHARING NEEDLES I WISH THAT THIS HAD EXISTED. THIS IS ABOUT SAVING LIVES. AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE UC SITES THEY'RE ALREADY USING. BUT RIGHT NOW FAR TOO MANY OF THEM ARE USING ON OUR SIDEWALKS AND BEHIND GARBAGE DUMPSTERS AND IN OUR PARKS NEAR WHERE PEOPLE LIVE OR WHERE PEOPLE WORK. THE QUESTION IS NOT WILL PEOPLE USE OUR ONE DAY BUT WHERE DO WE WANT THEM TO USE THAT WE WANTED TO BE ON THE SIDEWALK IN UNSANITARY CONDITIONS IN FRONT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE WALKING ON THE STREET POTENTIALLY WITH THEIR CHILDREN. WHAT DO WE WANT THEM TO BE IN A SAFE INDOOR HEALTHY SETTING WHERE WE CAN ENSURE THEY SURVIVE WHERE THEY CAN WE CAN ENSURE THEY HAVE A CLEAN HER. AND WE CAN HELP THE GET IN RECOVER I ASTRONOMICAL.

FIRSTLY THE BILL PROPOSES THAT ALL HEMP PRODUCT BE TESTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH CANADA CONTAMINANT STANDARDS I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO PRACTICAL PROBLEMS FOR BARNSLEY MANUFACTURED THIS ONE EXAMPLE THE STATE IMPOSES YOU'RE A TOLERANCE LEVEL FOR PESTICIDE RESIDUE FOR CANNABIS THAT APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THERE'S NO FEDERALLY APPROVED PRODUCT IT CAN BE USED ON CAMPUS HOWEVER AS A FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED FROM THE FIGHT AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES THERE ARE FEDERALLY AND STATE APPROVED PRODUCTS PAN. THEREFORE ENCAMPMENTS SANDERS HUGE FOR OTHER AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES SHOULD SUFFICE BURGER ALSO CONCERNED THE BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THE PRODUCTION AND SALE OF LOCAL FLOWER IN CALIFORNIA WE UNDERSTAND THE SENSITIVITIES AROUND INHALATION BUT THERE IS AN EXISTING THERAPEUTIC MARKET FOR THIS PRODUCT AND TYPICALLY PROVIDED BY OUR SMALLER URBAN HEMP FARMS AND MOREOVER IMPLEMENTATION WE'RE CONCERNED THAT WILL PERHAPS UNINTENTIONALLY PROHIBIT THE SALE OF ANY RAW FLOUR EVEN IF IT'S NOT INTENDED FOR INSTALLATION SO. THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE USES FOR RODRIGUEZ FLOWER ADVOCATE FOR OTHER SAGE AND LAVENDER I WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY CLOSELY WITH THE SPONSORS ON THE PROVISIONS THAT WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THEIR CONSIDERATION WITH THE REQUESTED AMENDMENTS INCORPORATED FOR THE COURTS REMOVED IN OUR POSITION AND HOPEFULLY SUPPORTING.

WITH THE COALITION AND I WOULD. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH HIM AS WELL TO ENSURE THAT WE DO GET MANY OF THESE QUESTIONS ANSWERED SPECIFICALLY AS IT PERTAINS TO TESTING WHICH I KNOW. STILL HAS A LOT OF- REQUIREMENTS ON THE HEMP INDUSTRY BUT ALSO- ALLOWING THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY TO SELL. HEMP PRODUCTS AS WELL WHICH I KNOW IS A SHARED GOAL AND BEING WORKED ON SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT- I WILL BE VOTING YESTERDAY AND I JUST THINK THE AUTHOR FOR. BEING OPEN TO THESE AMENDMENTS AND THESE IDEAS THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER GROVE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DO HAVE A CONCERN I KNOW I SUPPORTED THIS BILL IN THE PAST BUT I HAVE A CONCERN IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS SHARED. BY THE OPPOSITION SO I MAYBE OFF TRACK BUT A LOOK FOR THE AUTHOR TO CORRECT ME. THE CALIFORNIA CITY CALIFORNIA SUBMITTED ITS PLAN TO THE USDA- FOR ITS CANNABIS PROGRAM IT'S AN INDUSTRIAL HEMP PROGRAM. AND THE USDA SENT BACK THAT PROGRAM. TO CALIFORNIA WITH SOME AMENDMENTS THAT NEEDED TO TAKE PLACE AND THEN THOSE AMENDMENTS WERE SENT BACK. ACTUALLY THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THEM TODAY. THE HELP TO GET THEM BACK TO THE U. S. D. A. SO THAT THE REGULATIONS CAN GO INTO PLACE- BY MARCH TWENTY SECOND SO THERE'S CLEAR GUIDANCE. ON INDUSTRIAL HEMP PROCESSING FOR CALIFORNIA. MEETING THE STANDARDS THE U. S. STATE D. S. PUT FORTH FOR CALIFORNIA'S PLAN. MY CONCERN AND I WOULD HOPE THE AUTHOR CAN ALLEVIATE THAT CONCERN IS THAT. WILL THIS BILL- CHANGE ANYTHING TO DELAY THAT PLAN PROCESS. THEY SHOULD BE IN PLACE BY MARCH TWENTY SECOND. PENDING ANY- OTHER OBSTACLES. THE QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR YES RICHARD NO I AM NOT AND NOTHING I MEAN IN LESS TIME. TOTALLY MISSING SOMETHING I JUST CAN'T SEE HOW HOW THIS WOULD. A DELAY WHAT WOULD TELL ME TELL ME MORE ABOUT HOW YOU THINK THAT MIGHT HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF THIS. SO I HAVE- OBVIOUSLY OF INDUSTRIAL HEMP GROWERS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND THEIR CONCERN IS- THAT WITH THE USDA'S AMENDMENTS TO THE CALIFORNIA PLAN LEGISLATION THAT'S PASSED IN THE BUILDING COULD AFFECT THAT. AND I'M JUST ASKING FOR A CONFIRMATION THAT YOU DON'T SEE HOW YOUR BILL. WOULD AFFECT THAT- CALIFORNIA PLAN BEING SUBMITTED. BACK TO THE USDA BY THE TWENTY SECOND AND- HAVE YOU BEEN IN TOUCH WITH SECRETARY ROSS THE FARM BUREAU OR THE UNDERSECRETARY REGIONAL BRANDS. REGARDING THIS TO SEE IF IT'S- IF IT IS A POSSIBILITY THIS BILL WILL AFFECT THAT. MOVING FORWARD. NO I HAVEN'T PERSONALLY- I. KNOW I KNOW RAND MARTIN HERE IS RUNNING POINT ON THE- ON THE STAKEHOLDER SIDE COMMITTEE ANSWER THAT. MISTER MARTIN ACTUALLY THAT'S ABOUT MISTER MARTIN I THINK IT'S GOING TO THE MICROPHONE IF YOU WISH HIM TO ALSO. ADDRESS THE OPTION BUT- BUT CERTAINLY I AM VERY HAPPY TO MEET WITH YOUR FOLKS AND ALSO TALKS ACTUALLY- TO MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T BECOME A PROBLEM LIKE THIS IS. AS I'M. SURE YOU CAN APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS WHERE WE'RE NOT. THE TRY TO DO ANYTHING WILL BE ON THE UP NO I DO APPRECIATE THAT AND I AND I. THAT NOT WHAT YOUR INTENT IS I WAS JUST ABOUT AND THEN THE TEN A CONSEQUENCE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WE'RE SO CLOSE TO THE MARCH TWENTY SECOND DEADLINE SO I'M- CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR TAKE ON. HOW YOU THINK THE LEGISLATION WOULD AFFECT THIS- AMENDMENT PROCESS HAS BEEN GOING BACK AND FORTH FOR A FEW MINUTES. YES I THINK. SO I DON'T I DON'T SEE HOW WOULD HOW WOULD CAUSE TROUBLE BUT CERTAINLY OKAY HERE THAT'S YEAH THAT PROJECTS WERE GETTING REALLY SHORT ON TIME SO- CENTER- IT'S SOMETHING THAT. JUST MIGHT MAKE YOU WHICH GIVE A BRIEF ANSWER TO THAT IT'S A SERVICE QUESTION MISTER CHAIR I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE IT'S REALLY HARD TO HEAR UP HERE AND I AM NOT SURE WHAT SENATOR GROW IS ASKING ABOUT. I THINK WHAT IN ORDER TO SAVE TIME WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH THE SENATOR AND HER STAFF. AND DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE AND MAKE SURE THAT SHE'S SATISFIED THAT- WHATEVER CONCERN IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN. OKAY I THINK IT'S INTERFERENCE WITH FEDERAL PROCESS CORRECT. IT'S A CALIFORNIA PLAN SUBMITTED TO THE U. S. J. WITH AMENDMENTS. THAT ARE DUE BACK ACTUALLY THEY'RE DISCUSSING IN TODAY AND IT'S DUE BACK ON THE TWENTY SECOND SO THAT THE CALIFORNIA PLAN CAN GO FORWARD. ON INDUSTRIAL HIM AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AND I KNOW THAT HE'LL REACH OUT AND I JUST THINK YOU COULD- LET ME ASK A QUESTION. OKAY THANK YOU HOPEFULLY YOU CAN FOLLOW UP WITH. CENTER GROVE ON DATA.

WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR YES TO THIS BILL ESTABLISHES ROBUST REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF CALIFORNIA'S HEMP DERIVED CBD MARKETPLACE WHILE ELEVATING HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS- WITH STRICTEST IN THE NATION TESTING REQUIREMENTS THAT MIRROR THOSE FOR CANNABIS ALONGSIDE STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTION LEAVING PROTOCOLS.

BUT JUST WE ARE A LITTLE SHORT ON TIME NOW SO CENTER NEWMAN- ITEM NUMBER FIVE SB TWO FORTY TWO THANK YOU MISTER MISTER AND SANDERS- I AM HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF S. B. TWO FOUR TWO WHICH WOULD REQUIRE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE INSURERS TO REIMBURSE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR REGIONAL COSTS RELATED TO THE NECESSARY PROCUREMENT OF PP AND TESTING SUPPLIES DURING THE PANDEMIC. RIGHT BEGIN MY REMARKS ABOUT THAT LIKE TO KNOW THAT I'VE ALREADY AGREED TO THE THREE AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED. TO FROM THE OPPOSITION- AND ONE FROM THE CHAIR- THIS LEGISLATION BEFORE TODAY NOW AMENDED SEEKS TO PROTECT OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND PREVENT. THE SPREAD OF CODE NINETEEN WHILE ENSURING THAT SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZED MEDICAL PRACTICES. CAN REMAIN IN BUSINESS AND OPEN TO TREAT PATIENTS IN THEIR CARE. TODAY MORE THAN A YEAR INTO A HISTORIC PANDEMICS SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZE POSITION PRACTICES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. FIND THEMSELVES INCREASINGLY STRUGGLING. AS A DIRECT RESULT OF PANDEMIC DRIVEN CHANGES TO PROTOCOLS COMBINED WITH THE IMPACT OF SUCCESSIVE LOCKDOWNS AND STANDI GUIDANCE. TO AVOID MIXING AND TRAVEL A GREAT MANY MEDICAL PRACTICES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCE STEEP DECLINES. IN PATIENT VISITS AND REVENUE. YOU GUYS CAN YOU SCHOOL JUST A LITTLE BIT THAT WAY. THE ETCETERA CONSEQUENCE A GROWING NUMBER OF PRACTICES HAVE HAD HAD EITHER- TO EITHER CLOSE OFFICES ARE FOR LOW EMPLOYEES IN RECENT MONTHS SOMETIMES PLACING. IN JEOPARDY THEY'RE VERY VIABILITY TO CONTINUE AS GOING CONCERNS. AS CONTEXT A RECENT CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SURVEY OF THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED PHYSICIANS. FOUND THAT ALMOST HALF OR 49% OF PRACTICES HAVE HAD TO LAY OFF OR FURLOUGH PHYSICIANS AND STAFF. WITH FULLY 11% OF THOSE FORCED TO CLOSE THEIR PRACTICES AT LEAST TEMPORARILY. FURTHERMORE A SURVEY BY THE PHYSICIANS FOUNDATION. A NATIONAL NON PROFIT ESTIMATES THAT 80% OF ALL PHYSICIANS PHYSICIAN PRACTICES NATIONALLY OR AROUND SIXTEEN THOUSAND PRACTICES HAVE-PERMANENTLY SHUTTERED THEIR PRACTICES AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE ECONOMIC STRESSES FORCED UPON THEM. BY THE PANDEMIC. CONCURRENTLY AS A RESULT OF THE VAST CHANGES SPAWNED BY THE PANDEMIC. INCREASED PP USAGE IS THE NEW NORMAL MEDICAL SETTINGS ARE NO EXCEPTION PATIENTS TO MEDICAL AND DENTAL OFFICES. NOW EXPECT TO SEE PP CONSTANTLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY IN USE WHEN THEY VISIT A DOCTOR'S OR DENTIST'S OFFICE. THIS CHANGE IS STANDING OFFICE PROTOCOLS HAS COME AT A HIGH COST TO SMALL PRACTICES NEARLY HALF A PRACTICE OWNERS. RECENTLY SURVEYED BY THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION REPORTED THAT THEIR SPENDING ON PPP HAD INCREASED BY RATES OF TO ACCOMMODATE THE INCREASE COSTS MANY SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZE MEDICAL PRACTICES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LAY OFF STAFF OR REDUCE THEIR OPERATIONS. MEANWHILE PARTLY DUE TO THE SAME DECLINES IN PATIENT DEMAND THAT IF SO ADVERSELY AFFECTED THESE PRICES HEALTH INSURANCE TO HEALTH INSURERS HAVE ENJOYED RECORD REASON PROFITS THIS YEAR. IN SOME CASES MORE THAN DOUBLE THE PROFITS FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. INDEED PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS FEAR THAT THE INCREASED COST OF PP COMBINED WITH THE DROP IN PATIENT VISITS COULD RESULT IN A WAVE OF CONSOLIDATION. THAT WOULD INCREASE HEALTHCARE EXPENSES AND DECREASE PATIENT ACCESS TO CARE. MOREOVER IF CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO LOSE THE SMALLER PHYSICIAN PRACTICES IT WILL FURTHER INTENSIFY THE STRESSES ON OUR ALREADY OVERBURDENED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AND MAKE MEETING THE HEALTHCARE NEEDS OF PATIENTS EVEN HARDER I SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT RURAL AND UNDERSERVED AREAS WOULD BE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. BY SUCH RESULTS. AS WE FIGHT TO ELIMINATE THE THREAT OF COVET NINETEEN WE MUST ALSO ENSURE THAT HARD WORKING DOCTORS CAN MAINTAIN THEIR PRACTICES WHILE PRESERVING PATIENT ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE FOR THE GOOD OF MEDICAL CARE IN THE LONG TERM WE CAN'T LET THE ONE GOAL COME AT THE EXPENSE. OF THE OTHERS EVERYONE SHOULD BE CONTRIBUTING DURING A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND INSURERS IN THIS CASE ARE NO EXCEPTION. SB TWO FOUR TWO WILL ENSURE THAT THE BURDENS CREATED BY INCREASED UTILIZATION PP IN MEDICAL SETTINGS WILL BE FAIRLY SHARED BETWEEN HEALTH INSURERS AND THE SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZED PRACTICES PROVIDING PATIENT CARE. IN THIS VERY CHALLENGING TIME AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING COMMENTS OF THE CREDO EXCEPT THE THREE AMENDED SUGGESTED BY THE OPPOSITION AND BY THE CHAIR. FIRST THERE WERE THE ORIGINAL SCOPE OF THE BILL HAS BEEN NARROWED BY INCLUDING A DEFINITION FOR A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER SECOND THE BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED TO SPECIFY THE PLANS ARE ONLY HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR SUPPLIES USED. ON THEIR MEMBERS THE MEMBERS OF THOSE PLANS DURING A SERVICE AND NOT ON A PRO RATA OR SOME OTHER BASIS. AND THIRD LANGUAGE HAS BEEN INCORPORATED THAT SPECIFIES INSURERS WILL BE REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE FOR PP IN TESTING ONLY FOR THE DURATION OF THE CURRENT. PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY OR UNTIL A PLAN IS ABLE TO RENEGOTIATE WITH PROVIDERS. WHICHEVER COMES FIRST WITH ME TO TEST TO FIGHT TO. START CAN. A POSITION WE CHOICE MET GROUP. AND STEPHANIE ST REDDING A PRACTICING DENTIST IN THE CURRENT CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COUNSEL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU SIR NEWMAN THAT'S- BRING UP FIRST OF ALL DR ERIC HANSEN ON TO THE PHONE LINE. YEAH OKAY HERE IT IS- DR ERIC KANSEN I'M A FAMILY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN NUMBER YOU KNOW COUNTY. AND I CURRENTLY PRACTICE IN ME UNDERSERVED AREA- YOU DOING PRIMARY CARE AND BASICALLY ABOUT A YEAR AGO ALMOST TO THE DAY- OUR ABILITY TO PRACTICE MEDICINE IN THE WAY THAT WE'VE DONE IT FOR YEARS CHANGED ABRUPTLY. AND AT THAT MOMENT I ACTUALLY HAD TO GO OUT AND REALLY RESTRUCTURED AND HOW I WAS GOING TO BE PATIENT. FIREMAN WHERE I WOULD HAVE A POTENTIAL RISK TO EXPOSURE FOR MY STAFF MYSELF BUT TO OTHER PATIENTS. AND IMMEDIATELY WENT UP ON A CELL PHONE FROM MY OFFICE I ORDERED A LARGE SUPPLY OF PPP KNOWING THAT THAT WAS POTENTIALLY MY ONLY HOPE THAT THE TURN UP FOR. YOU KNOW KEEPING MY STAFF THAT IS SAFE AND- AND BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO MY PATIENTS- AT FOLLOWING THE- SHUT DOWN JUST A FEW DAYS AFTER THAT- IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THAT PDP WAS ACTUALLY NOT EVEN AVAILABLE AND THAT. OUR NORMAL MEDICAL PROVIDERS OR MEDICAL SERVICES PROVIDERS HAD. ALREADY RUN OUT OF THEIR SUPPLIES AND I WAS NOT GOING TO GET A MORE PP WE HAD TO BASICALLY TRANSITION TO VIRTUAL MEDICINE ENTIRELY FOR ABOUT A THREE MONTH PERIOD. I NEVER DID CLOSE MY DOORS BUT AS THE SENATOR POINTED OUT MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAD TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE I PRACTICE. FOR THE MAJORITY OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDED TO OUR PATIENTS IS IN SMALL PRACTICES- IN THE SMALL PRACTICE SETTING AN INDEPENDENT POSITION REDDING- THAT THE CATASTROPHIC SITUATION WHERE R. E. OURS THEN BECOME THE NEXT. LEVEL OF CARE WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY NOT APPROPRIATE WHEN YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT ARE GRAVELY ILL GOING TO THE HOSPITAL- FOR CODE AND THEN OTHERS THAT ARE JUST TRYING TO SEEK HELP AND GETTING EXPOSED TO COLD ITSELF. WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETY I WOULD ACTUALLY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE. PP TO GET ME THROUGH THE NEXT THE MONTHS AFTER THAT WAS ME OF A TO ME. BUT THE POINT IS THAT WE- AS AGAIN AFTER TO TURN AROUND. WE TO MINISTERS OF. WE CAN TO RECALL THIS. AND IT'S BASED FROM THAT SHOULD BE. OF OUR COMMUNITY LEADER PIPES ON THE PART. OKAY ALL RIGHT ON THE SITE IT'S FAR AS A YOU KNOW THE KNICKERS- INDIAN. OF THE TOWARD DIRE- TO A TO BE SUPPORTED IN THE TIME OKAY THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU FOR MUCH. LET'S NOW MOVE ON HERE TO- THE DOCTOR STEPHANIE SANDRA E. BRING HER ON THE LINE. THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME YES PLEASE BEGIN. TWO MINUTES RIGHT. HI GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME DR TECHNIQUE AND RT I RUN TO DENTAL PRACTICES IN THE GREATER SACRAMENTO AREA. I HAVE A TOTAL OF THREE EMPLOYEES AND WE SEE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED PATIENTS PER MONTH. I'M ALSO THE CHAIR OF THE PDA GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COUNCIL AND I'M THINKING ON BEHALF OF OUR TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND MEMBERS THAT. I'M PROUD TO SEE THE DENTIST HAS A- GOOD. TO BE ABLE TO TREAT OUR PATIENTS LATELY DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE ONLY POSSIBLE I THINK IF WE CAN ONLY INCREASED TREATMENT COSTS. IT'S BEEN DENTAL TEAM MEMBERS COME FROM A HIGHER RISK OF WORKPLACE EXPOSURE TO AIRBORNE PATHOGENS. APART EVERY DATE OF WERE UNABLE TO WEAR MASKS THAT ARE PRESENT IN PERFORM PROCEDURES THAT TYPICALLY GENERATE AEROSOL WHICH CAN SPREAD COVERT MORE READILY. FOUR PP INCLUDING CLOUDS BASED MATH. I NINETY FIVE LEVEL THREE MAP HAD IN DOWN IS NOT REQUIRED TO SAFELY TREAT PATIENTS AND PROTECT MY TOP LINE. MAKE PP MANDATORY AND MEDICALLY NECESSARY. THE COST OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT HAS GONE UP EXPONENTIALLY SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC FOR EXAMPLE BOXING GLOVES USED TO COST ME AROUND NINETEEN DOLLARS. NOW UPWARDS OF FIFTY DOLLARS DUE TO INCREASED COSTS INSTRUCTIONS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND INCREASED LEVELS OF REQUIRED PP. MY HUSBAND IS NORTH IT HONEST IN OAK GROVE AND SEE HE'S HE'S ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PATIENTS PER DAY YOU'RE PROBABLY TWO BOXES A BUMPER DAY. BUDGET INCREASED OVERHEAD SIXTY DOLLARS PER WORKING DAY FOR HIS BUSY PRACTICE. YOU COST THEIR NEW UNEXPECTED. AND NOT REGULAR BUSINESS EXPENSES.

THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON SB TWO FORTY TWO INCLUDING RECENT CLARIFYING THAT. TDP WHOSE MEMBERS COVER THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WITH DENTAL BENEFITS HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH SB TWO FORTY TWO. YOUR MANDATE THAT HEALTH PLANS REIMBURSE PROVIDERS FOR BUSINESS EXPENSES INTENDED TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF DISEASE. IT REQUIRES THAT ALL PLANS DO THE SAME. THE MEASURE FAILED TO TAKE INTO INTO ACCOUNT THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEDICAL AND DENTAL PRODUCTS. PERSONAL BENEFITS ARE VOLUNTARY NOT BE MANDATED BENEFITS. AND SECOND DENTAL PLAN PREMIUMS ARE PROBABLY ONE TWENTIETH OF A MEDICAL PREMIUM. GET THE BILL SPECIFICALLY STATES WE MUST PROVIDE A COMPARABLE REIMBURSEMENT FOR MEDICAL COUNTERPARTS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REIMBURSE A COMPARABLE AMOUNT BUT ONLY 5% OF RESOURCES. THIS PROVISION WOULD RESULT IN INCREASED PREMIUMS BECAUSE PEOPLE EMPLOYERS TO OFFER DENTAL BENEFITS. GDP PLANS FULLY APPRECIATE THE CHALLENGES THAT IS EXPERIENCING TWENTY TWENTY WHICH IS WHY DENTAL PLANS VOLUNTARILY PROVIDED. FINISHED NEARLY THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN RELIEF INCLUDE DIRECT TV HE GRANTS. INCREASED FEES LOANS AND MANY OTHER PROGRAMS THAT AS FAR REACHING DATA REQUESTED BY THE STATE.

IN SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF ON TOP OF THE NATION REALLY COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. INSERTING INTERESTINGLY THE BILL DOESN'T REQUIRE PROVIDERS JUST BY NEED.

YEAH I WOULD I WOULD JUST RIGHT INTO IT- NICHOLAS WE CALIFORNIA'S OF HEALTH PLANS WERE OPPOSED SB TWO FORTY TWO- WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION WITH THE SENATOR WE KNOW WAS INTENTIONS ARE GOOD WE DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS A SHORT SIGHTED PROPOSAL BEING PROMOTED AT THE WRONG TIME. THE NEW REIMBURSEMENT MANDATE FOR HEALTH PLANS TO PAY FOR A BROAD ARRAY OF BUSINESS EXPENSES. YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT ITS BROADER THAN PEOPLE HERE INCLUDING WAS LIKE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS INTERESTING. AND TRANSPORTERS SPECIMENS. SO IT'S NOT LIMITED TO KEEP THE- AND YOU KNOW I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE ABSOLUTELY RECOGNISE IT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. LAST YEAR- PATIENT VOLUME WAS DOWN TO THE DUE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S RECOMMENDATION TO HOLD ELECTED TO COME HERE. THAT IS WHY EARLY IN A PANDEMIC HEALTH PLAN TO STEP DOWN. TO ASSIST OUR PROVIDER PARTNERS IN A MYRIAD OF WAYS. EXTENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WHICH INCLUDED THE DONATION OF P. P. OF AND OTHER SERVICES- WE ALSO SUPPORT THE BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE AND FEDERAL ASSISTANCE TO PROVIDERS TO SEE THEM THROUGH THE PANDEMIC. I MEAN. CONDITIONALLY BILLS DIRECTLY. EXISTING PROGRAM IN THE- COUGH FOR. IN URGENT PROCEDURES- AND- ART DALY. THAT- NO ARE BACK TO PRE PAY. LEVELS AND CLEAN ALL YOU IN A READ ANALYSIS BY HOWEVER YOU. BACK THAT UP. PROVIDERS OR THE RECEIPT. BILLIONS IN PER MONTH FROM HEALTH PLANS OF PATIENTS IN CAPITAL PAYMENT. ON THESE ARE. THAT GO THE DOOR REGARDLESS OF PATIENT IN INCOME FROM SIR AND BUSINESS ADMIN. COSTS. MISTER WORTH ABOUT FIFTY TO FIFTY FIVE BILL DOLLARS PER YEAR AND AGAIN NOT TIED TO PATIENT- IN OTHER POINT ARRAY MISTER. AND MA'AM IT. REALLY OVER THE LAST YEAR IN PLANS ARE TO THE THIRTY WITH IN PERSON SERVICES. WILL BE OVERHEAD PER IN SOME CASES ACTUALLY DECLINED THIS IS NOT TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. HERE OPENS TO THE CONSUMER HARM IS AT BILL FOR HEALTH PLANS TO DO CRITICAL PRISON OR ASK YOU TO WRITE CONSUMERS TIME UP HERE. AWAY FROM CARE TO NON. SERVICES I MEAN WE- DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS TIME SO WE ARE YOU TO VOTE NO THANK AND- THANK. TECHNOLOGY WHICH OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT. THAT OF COURSE. AND COMMON FROM THE COMMITTEE US ROCK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW I READ. THAT THIS. BILL WILL BE. FOR HEALTH- PLANS AND OTHERS IMPLEMENT AND THERE'S SOME KIND ISSUE BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE REIMBURSEMENT IS TIED TO SPECIFIC PATIENT ENCOUNTERS- AND A AND A BILLING CODE IN THE TRADITIONAL MANNER THE BILLING IS. IS CONDUCTED AND GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE'RE IN- I PLAN TO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. THERE IS ONE ISSUE HAVING TO DO WITH THE DEFINITION OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THAT'S WHEN I BRING UP IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT LOCAL. MERGERS TO ACTIONS HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DECLARE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES AND- IF THAT'S TRUE AND GIVEN THAT I WOULD ASK THAT THE AUTHOR TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND- PERHAPS MAKE SURE THAT WE SPECIFICALLY NARROW THE PUBLIC HEALTH. EMERGENCY AND DEFINE IT TO. A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THAT IS STILL THE CLEARED UP THE STATE LEVEL OR THE NATIONAL LEVEL. AS HE MOVES THIS BILL FORWARD FROM THIS COMMITTEE- ONWARD AND UPWARD IN THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU MR. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS ARE AT CENTER MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I WAS TRYING TO GET SOME ANSWERS TO THIS PRIOR TO THIS POINT CENTER SURE IN TIME BUT I WONDER IF THE AUTHOR COULD JUST. CAN YOU JUST TELL ME WHAT THE AMENDMENTS ARE. YES CENTERS SO THE I CAN GIVE YOU THE ESSENCE OF THE AMOUNTS I DON'T HAVE THEM IN FRONT OF ME SO- THE FIRST AMENDMENT- IT NARROWED THE SCOPE WITH THE BILL DELIBERATELY BY INCLUDING AN EXPLICIT DEFINITION FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SO IT WASN'T- AMBIGUOUS OR VAGUE. SECOND AMENDMENT IS SPECIFIED AMENDED IS FOR THE PLANS WOULD ONLY BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE- FOR THOSE SUPPLIES USED ON THE MEMBERS OF THOSE PLANS RIGHT SO PLANS WERE GOING TO HAVE TO. REIMBURSE ON A PRO RATA BASIS TO SOME OF THE BAY CITY WOULD TIE DIRECTLY. AS AN ROTH POINT OUT TO ACTUAL SERVICES PROVIDED- AND COACH PROVIDED UNDER THE BUILDING- FOR THOSE SERVICES- AND THEN THE LAST. WAS ABOUT LANGUAGE TO REIMBURSE FOR P. IN TESTING AND OTHER COSTS- ONLY FOR THE DURATION OF THE CURRENT PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES I'D LIKE TAKE THIS MOMENT. TO ACKNOWLEDGE- TED WROTE THAT'S A GOOD POINT- AND YOU KNOW BUT I THINK IT MAKES SENSE. TO CLARIFY THE DEFINITION OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AT THE STATE LEVEL. OR AT A MINIMUM. IS THAT WHAT TO EXPECT PEACE. IT DOES THANK YOU AND I'M JUST. I THINK I WANT TO TOUCH ON- THE- YOU SAID IT WOULD ONLY BE REQUIRED. DURING THE CURRENT- HEALTH ISSUE. SEVEN IT IS MEAN. FOR AS LONG AS- LIKE. WHO HAS TO DECLARE THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE THIS HEALTH EMERGENCIES- TO GENEROSA POINT WHICH IS A GOOD ONE THE STATE THAT THE STATE WOULD WITH AN CDPH ORDERS IN ENDING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. HE GETS THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE DEVICES CITY PH IS. A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY SO THAT THE DECLARATION WOULD BE LIFTED OKAY- AND I AND I ASK THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE. IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY IS DECLARED OFTENTIMES IT IT GOES ON FOR YEARS IT DOESN'T AND YOU KNOW RIGHT AWAY THESE THESE COME ON FOR SOME TIME AND SO I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THIS WILL BE- THIS STATE OF EMERGENCY WILL B IN EFFECT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHT INTO THAT BUT I JUST THAT IS A CONCERN OF MINE IS HOW HOW LONG THIS WILL CONTINUE I THINK IT'S A FAIR POINT SO- THE STATE EMERGING COVERS ONLY THIS. PARTICULAR CENTER BUT A WHOLE RANGE OF OTHERS AND SO- IT YOU KNOW IT ALSO APPLIES TO- RESTRICTIONS ON BUSINESS ETCETERA THE BLUEPRINT FREE OPENING- AND SO IT WILL GET LIFTED- AND ITS APPLICATION WILL NO LONGER APPLIED A WHOLE HOST OF AREAS I DON'T THINK IT'S THE SAME- TO YOUR POINT OF YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE A DROUGHT. YEAH IT'S FAIRLY EXPLICIT MISCARRIAGE AND I'D BE GLAD TO GET YOU YOU KNOW THE MORE CLARIFICATION. LETTER THANK YOU. THIRTY GROVE. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I'D LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR I KNOW-THAT HE IS- HIS INTENTION THE INTENTION OF THIS BILL IS A GOOD INTENTION- I DO HAVE CONCERNS ARE YOU LISTEN TO. YOU KNOW ONE OF WITNESSES AND TESTIMONY IS SMALL PROVIDER THAT HAS BEEN. YOU KNOW-EXPENDING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESOURCES ON ON PP COVERAGE. A MY CONCERN LIES WITH SMALL. ORGANIZATIONS LIKE WESTERN HEALTH INSURANCE THAT PROVIDES. COVERAGE I WOULD HATE TO SEE. SUTTER HEALTH AND- I GUESS MY REAL CONCERN IS THE DEFINITION OF PP WHAT'S I'VE I'VE LOOKED AT YOUR BILL AND I DO HAVE- SOME. OF THE DESCRIPTION IN THERE BUT IT'S NOT- IT'S NOT SPECIFIC WHAT'S YOUR DEFINITION OF PP. TO THE CHAIR. PRICES ARE GROWING. LET ME ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I THINK TWO TWO YEAR AND- YEAH WE'VE BEEN DOWN TO MAKE A- OF SASS SAYS FACTORED IN THE OPPONENT. THAT OPPOSITION BILL I I'M GLAD TO RIVER AT IT WOULD BE A I DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO. IN A BROAD OR NARROW DOESN'T PPE- WHAT WE'RE ASPIRING TO IS IN OKAY OF A UNIVERSE SIX. DEFINITION OF THOSE ITEM. THAT ARE THAT BEEN A SPECIAL IS NO. FOR A CO SAVE OF AND THAT CENTER- AND I'M I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THEIR LANGUAGE AND THAT MAKES THAT POSSIBLE. THIS IS YOU FOR THAT IN YOUR BILL ON ON ON PAGE TWO LINES THROUGH. IT SAYS SEARCH PERSONAL PART EQUIPMENT OR PPE INFO CAN SUPPLIES OR MATERIALS. MEDICAL DIED EQUIPMENT INCLUDING TESTING. TO PER SE. THE COST OF TRAINS SPACE. IN TO. SYSTEMS ARE AND- FOR PROCESS TEST. AND OR ANY OTHER REASON TECH. EXPO DOES VERY TO AS AS A P. FOR. PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. SO I JUST WONDERED IF AT ALL YOU COULD TELL ME DOES IT COVER DISPOSABLE MEDICAL GLOVES. IT THE I ASSUME IT- YEAH. SOLIDIFY FOR MEDICAL EXAM ROOM MEDICAL OFF SUPPLY. ONLY WHEN USED IN THE CONDUCT OF THE MEDIC EXAMINER DURING THE PUBLIC OF EMERGENCY WAYS THEY- AND DESERVE TO PUT. THAT AND AGAIN WE WE'VE HAD A AMEND- THAT'LL FOR IN THE BILLING PROCESS TO BE VERY SPECIFIC AROUND THOSE THE BILLING IN THE COACH. SO N. I LOOKED AT AND I TALKED TO SOME OF MY HOSPITALS ABOUT SOME OF THE MEDICAL- IN SOME DOCTORS WHAT IS SOME OF THE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT OR THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT% THAT IS SUPPLIED. BY SEN YOU KNOW BY I SAID YOU GUYS AND I WAS TALKING TO THEM. I MEAN THE LIST ITSELF LIKE YOU KNOW SERVICE IN AND- DISINFECTANTS- AT HAND SANITIZERS AND DISPOSABLE HAND SANITIZER- EQUIPMENT TO DISPOSE OF IT. ONLINE AUCTION NINETY FIVE RESPIRATORS WHICH ARE VERY EXPENSIVE A HOSPITAL KANSAS WAS THE LAB COATS DISPOSABLE SHOE COVERS SAFETY GLASSES EYEWEAR STATIONS INCLUDING THE PLANNING ASSOCIATED WITH EYE WASH STATION COMMITTEE KIT. I JUST THAT IT THE BILL IS SO VERY BROAD. THAT DOES NOT IT DOESN'T JUST SAY PP LIKING YOU KNOW DOWN IN IN FIVE MASS SERVICE. AND SO MY CONCERN IS LIKE I SAID IS THAT WHERE DOES THE COST COVERAGE COME FROM IF PLANS IF THIS BILL DOESPASS IN PLANS ARE REQUIRED. TO COVER THIS TO REIMBURSED- MEDICAL PROVIDERS WHICH I UNDERSTAND THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL COST IF THERE IS ADDITIONAL COST FOR EVERY BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH PLEXIGLASS MOVING THINGS PROVIDING MASS TO YOU KNOW TO SERVERS AND- YOU KNOW THERE'S A COST TO THIS PANDEMIC FOR ALMOST EVERY. SINGLE BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF THE CALIFORNIA IF NOT EVERY BUSINESS- I DISTANTLY IT'S VERY BROAD AND I'D LIKE TO SEE IF YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN IN SPECIFICALLY DEFINING WHAT P. P. E. IS INSTEAD OF THESE BROAD STATEMENTS. I SUPPOSE I AM TO DO THAT SPECIALLY- CONCERT WITH THE SPONSORS PROBABLY THIS IS NOT A GOOD VENUE FOR DOING THAT SO- WE HAVE AN DE. TO WORK. THE OPPOSITION WITH THE CHURCH IN THE- TO SURE THE LAND IS CLEAR- AND IN CAN. WITH CONTENT. WHICH TO PUT. PRACTITIONERS TO SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE PRACTICE. WHO HAVE BEEN. BY THE CALL. OF CODE REAL XIN- THERE A FRESH ABOVE WHICH- I THINK YOU CAN. OVER VALID ARE YOU REST- THOSE ARE REAL TO THESE. AND I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS RENTED CLEAR IN THE LEGISLATION. THE YOU FOR THAT AND BASED ON THE RESPONSES THAT IT'S FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM OF PRACTITIONERS- LIKE THE ONE THAT TESTIFIED IN THAT IN THIS. POSITION OF SUPPORT THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAS A PRACTICE IN SAN BERNARDINO- IS I AND I AGAIN I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO READ THE ENTIRE BILL I JUST READ THE FIRST THREE PAGES- FIRST FOUR PAGES AND- IF- IS THERE ANY LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT LIMITS THE SIZE OF THE PROVIDER SO IT'S NOT. YOU KNOW. MAJOR HOSPITALS MAJOR LIKE SUTTER HEALTH- WHEN COLLINS HEALTH DON'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT BUT IS IT JUST FOR SOME. MEDIA PROVIDER. NOT CURRENTLY LANGER BUT WITH WE TRIED ADOPT. FROM A DIRECTION WHICH AROUND. THE ACTUAL- SIR- IN THE BUILDING PROCESS. OKAY WELL THANK YOU AND I THAT AND I APPRECIATE YOUR HONESTY THAT ARE YOU HAVING I GUESS MIKE- IN MY CAN IS THAT. YOU SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED THAT THIS PARTICULAR BILLING YOUR INTENT IS FOR SMALL OR MEDIUM PROVIDERS BUT YET THERE'S NO LANGUAGE IN THERE. YOU SEE IT'S FOR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT BUT IT EXPANDS UP TO TECHNOLOGY IN A VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS THAT COULD BE VERY COSTLY. AND T. INDIVIDUALS PROVIDING SERVICES- THE PLANS TO RE REIMBURSE SO- I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE OF THAT AND IT JUST SEEMS WAY TOO BROAD. AND IT IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME THAT IT DOESN'T JUST PROVIDE FOR SMALL. INDEPENDENT PROVIDERS WHICH WERE ON THE LINE WHICH WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE TAKEN CARE OF BUT- IT'S FAR TOO COSTLY OF THE BUILD. FOR THE PLANS I WOULD THINK. SO THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. C. NINE NINE THE RESULTS AND NEWMAN I WANT THANK YOU SO MUCH- FOR- WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON- AS WELL THE OPPOSITION ON AMENDMENTS I THINK THE- GIVEN SOME OF THE QUESTIONS FROM- GOOD FRIEND CENTER GROVE I DO WANT TO CLARIFY FIRST OF ALL IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL- FOR. EXAMPLE THE INCREASE PAYMENTS ARE DUE TO IMAGINE YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE A SMALL OWNER LIKE I AM- AND- YOU SUDDENLY YOUR COSTS GO UP NOT JUST BECAUSE THERE'S A PANDEMIC BUT BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN A SPECIFIC PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS THAT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW BECAUSE THERE ARE NEW STANDARD OF CARE GUIDELINES THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY LIBEL FOR IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW- SO YOU COULD BE SUED IF YOU DIDN'T FOLLOW THEM. AND THERE'S ACTUALLY ADDITIONAL EXPENSES THAT AND BUT YET WHEN YOU NEGOTIATE YOUR CONTRACT WITH THE HEALTH PLAN DOES EXPENSES WERE PART OF THAT CONTRACT BECAUSE THEY WERE DONE PRIOR TO THE CODE BUT WHAT WE DID SAY WHAT WE DID DO IN THE AMENDMENTS TO SAY THAT IT'S NOT JUST TILL THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IS THAT ACTUALLY IF YOU. HAVE A NEW NEGOTIATION WITH THE HEALTH PLAN THAT NOW YOU KNOW WHAT THIS EXPENSES ARE YOU CAN CORPORATE INTO YOUR NEGOTIATION THEN ACTUALLY AND THEN SO YOU COULD NEGOTIATE NEW RATES THAT WOULD INCORPORATE THOSE ADDITIONAL EXPENSES THE OTHER PART- THE AMENDMENT WAS ACTUALLY TO NEVER AGAIN THERE THE BILL SO THAT YOUR- AND THAT IS SO THAT THE IT'S EXPENSES RELATED TO HAVING TO FOLLOW- PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS AND OTHER- AND- THE STANDARD CARE GUIDELINES THAT WERE NOT PRESENT PRIOR TO THE- PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. SO AGAIN THIS IS NOT OPEN ENDED- IT'S VERY SPECIFIC TO THOSE TYPES OF EXPENSES I POINT OUT THAT AGAIN AS YOU SAID CENTER NEWMAN- WE ALSO SAID THAT IT'S ONLY FOR THE PATIENT TO THAT PARTICULAR PLANT A LOT OF PRACTICES ACTUALLY SEE PATIENTS THAT ARE COVERED PIPE PLANS OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN SO THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO GET THOSE- THOSE EXPENSES COVERED THERE BUT- I DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU WORK WITH MY OFFICE TO TRY TO ADDRESS MANY OF THESE ISSUES. WE DID NARROW THE BILL AND THAT WAY TO BE SURE THAT'S VERY TOUGH- TOWARD. SURE WE SUSTAIN OUR- PHYSICIAN AND DENNIS DOWN AND OTHER NOW BY WAY DOESN'T HOSP SO HEALTH THE HOSPITAL'S HAS NOT BEEN A FROM THIS BILL- THAT ANOTHER THING THAT WAS DONE AS A- AND- I THINK IT IS IT DOES THE PURPOSES BILL TO TRY TO. THE THE MAINTENANCE WORK TRY TO STRAY THE RIGHT BALANCE THE FACT THAT WORKED WITH US MY COMMITTEES WELL AS WHAT THE OPPOSITE- JUST FIRST COMEY HER I'M SURE TO BE ADDITION. CONVERSATIONS I DO A PRE THE CONCERNS OR TRYING TO STRIKE DURING BALANCE IN THAT WE HAVE A- YOU KNOW AS AS A AND DENTAL NETWORKS- DIED BECAUSE ON THE DENTAL SIDE I JUST POINT OUT- SAID WILL PERSONAL NOW ABOUT. EXAMPLE OF DIDN'T A FACT THAT NEED AND NINETY FIVE MASKS ALL PRIOR TO THE UPPER- BECAUSE OF THE OPERATING GO AND SAY YOU HAVE TO AND I FIVE BY THE WE'RE DIDN'T SHOW AND QUITE HIGHLY PRICE- SINCE THE PANDEMIC. AND SO THE ONLY THING ABOUT WHERE TO THE WHAT HAPPEN TO THOSE AND THEN OF HOW DO WE DISTRIBUTE AS BECAUSE IN A WAY. THAT THAT THAT- ALLOWS A PRACTICES TO CAN SO THE WE STILL HAVE A TO THE PEOPLE PROVIDING THE CARE SO- AGAIN A REAL APPRECIATE YOU TAKING AMEND AND WORKING I SURE THERE'S A DISH WORKING TO DO- SAID NEWMAN- SO WITH THAT- WE YOU LIKE CLOSE. I'D BE MR SURE YOU CLOSE BETTER THAN I EVER COULD. AT THIS ONE OF THE BETTER OF HAVING A DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE. SO THANK YOU SO CALL I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON S. B. TWO FOUR TWO.
