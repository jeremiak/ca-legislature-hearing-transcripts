MEMBERS IN THE AUTHORS DOING WELL HOW ARE YOU ALL AND GOOD AFTERNOON AND A NOTION THAT WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM -- WILL START TO KEEP THE COMMITTEE AS THEY ARE SUBCOMMITTEE OKAY. THANK YOU MAN. ALRIGHT VERY GOOD WILL GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE. APPLY TO A BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THINKING YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR HARD WORK MUCH APPRECIATED. SB FOURTEEN THIRTY FOUR WHAT SUPPORT AND ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF BATTERY ELECTRIC TRANSIT BUSES TRANSIT AGENCIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA REPLACING CONVENTIONAL FUEL TRANSIT BUSES. WITH BATTERY ELECTRIC TRANSIT BUSES AS TRANSIT AGENCIES MOVED TO SCALE UP THEIR DEPLOYMENT A BATTERY ELECTRIC BUSES. MANY HAVE FOUND THAT THE COST OF ELECTRICITY EXCEEDS CONVENTIONAL FUEL AND IS LESS PREDICTABLE. THE COST AND UNPREDICTABILITY OF ELECTRICITY AS A FUEL IS SLOWING THE ADOPTION OF CLEANER ENERGY TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS VITAL TO MEETING THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS AND IMPROVING OUR STATE'S AIR QUALITY. THE CALIFORNIA TRANSIT ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS MORE THAN EIGHTY TRANSIT AGENCIES IN THE STATE. HAS IDENTIFIED THE COST OF ELECTRICITY AS ONE OF THE TOP THREE BARRIERS TO TRANSIT ELECTRIFICATION. AS THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS CURRENTLY ADVANCING REGULATION TO REQUIRE ALL EIGHT TRANSIT AGENCIES TO PURCHASE ZERO EMISSION BUSES. THE NEED TO FIND A SOLUTION HAS BECOME MORE URGENT SP FOURTEEN THIRTY FOUR IS ESSENTIAL TO CALIFORNIA'S GOALS OF TRANSITIONING TO CLEANER ENERGY REDUCING TOXIC. POLLUTANTS IN THE AIR AND COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS. AND INCLUDING THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS MICHAEL HIMSELF THE CALIFORNIA TRANSIT ASSOCIATION WORTHY SPONSORS OF THIS LEGISLATION SENATOR LEYVA DID A GOOD JOB OF SUMMARIZING THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. I'M JUST GONNA NOTE -- THAT A VOTE FOR THIS BILL TODAY IS A VOTE IN FAVOR OF ACCELERATING THE MORE COST EFFECTIVE DEPLOYMENT ZERO EMISSION BUSES. ON SOMETHING IT WILL RESULT IN AIR QUALITY GAINS -- THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OF WOULD REQUIRE ONLY -- THAT THE I USE THAT HAVE NOT YET FILED RATE DESIGN APPLICATIONS THAT ENCOURAGE THEIR MISSION VAST PLAN TO DO SO. I'M WE THINK THAT HAVING THIS CONVERSATION NOW WELL AGENCIES ARE JUST SCALING UP THEIR DEPLOYMENTS MAKES GOOD SENSE. WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE.

OUR MEDIUM HEAVY DUTY RACED TO SUPPORT THE TRANS AGENCIES TO ELECTRIFY THEIR FLEET THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS DIVING OF FLEMING'S ON BEHALF OF PACIFIC GAS ELECTRIC COMPANY WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE AUTHOR. THE SPONSORS AND HER STAFF ON THIS BILL WE THINK YOU FOR THE AMENDMENTS WILL LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE WITNESSES OPPOSITION. SEEING MEMBERS THE PUBLIC IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE FORGET BACK THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS. ALRIGHT I HAVE A QUESTION. PLEASE A SO YOU'VE AGREED TO TAKE AMENDMENT THAT SAYS THE RATE TARA FOR QUIET UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL NOT RESULT IN COST SHIFTS TO NON PARTICIPATING CUSTOMERS CORRECT OUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. IT MEANS WE WON'T SHIFT THE COSTS. SO IT WASN'T MY AMENDMENT IT WAS A IT WAS THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENT AND I JUST AND I BELIEVE THAT'S RIGHT JUST MEANS WE'RE NOT GOING TO SHIP THE COSTS YAKIMA SOMEONE'S GOT TO PAY RIGHT IT DIDN'T WORK. PROVIDING ELECTRICITY TO TRANSIT AUTHORITIES AT BELOW MARKET RATES THAT'S GOT IT THE MONEY'S GOT TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE SO WHERE WE'RE GONNA COME FROM IF IT'S NOT SHIFTED TO NON PARTICIPATING CUSTOMERS SO I CAN PROVIDE SOME PERSPECTIVE ON THAT -- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON FOR EXAMPLE HAS ADVANCED STATE WHAT DESIGN PROPOSAL -- THAT WOULD RELIEVE AT THE CALL DEMAND CHARGES [inaudible] YOUR GENERATION YOUR YOUR DRAW FROM THE GRID WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS IN WAIVING THOSE THOSE FEES THEY BAKE THEM INTO THEIR TIME OF USE OF FEES WHICH ARE. OF WHAT AGENCIES PAY BASED ON ARMED SERVICES DRAWING OUT AT CERTAIN POINTS OF THE DAY AND SO WHAT YOU'RE ABLE TO DO IN A IN A FACT IS ADDRESS SOME OF THE FIXED COSTS IN AND BUILD THEM INTO VARIABLE COSTS. AND WITH THAT AND AND AGENCIES STILL PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE BUT SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN PREDICT MORE READILY AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE A FIXED COST THAT WILL SPIKE. DEPENDING ON THE DEMAND THAT YOU'RE DRAWING AT ANY ONE POINT IN TIME. OKAY SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE COST OF PROVIDING. BELOW MARKET RATE ELECTRICITY TRANSIT AUTHORITIES WILL BE BAKED INTO A TIME OF USED COSTS FOR COMPANIES THAT WOULD BE ONE ONE ONE STRATEGY THAT COULD BE USED -- WITHIN WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK WOULD THAT NOT BE A VIOLATION OF THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT IN THE WOULD THAT BE A COST SHIFT THAT WOULD BE A NON PARTICIPATING CUSTODY WOULD BE A CHANGE. IN THE WAY THAT COSTS ARE ALLOCATED BUT THEY WOULD BE BORN FULLY BY THE TRANSIT AGENCY. I THINK WE'RE PROUD OF NOW NOW I'M REALLY CONFUSED GO IT'S I THINK THAT THE COMMITMENT IS IS THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO COST SHIP THAT WE ARE GOING TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PAY FOR IT BUT WE'RE NOT SHIFTING IT TO THOSE WHO MIGHT. BE USING IT. I DON'T THINK I HAVE A COMPLETE ANSWER FOR IS WHAT I'M SAYING Y. AND I'M I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THE COMMITTEES. ARE IS IS -- FOISTING ON YOU RIGHT SO I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU THAT YOU KNOW THAT THIS CAME FROM A COMMITTEE AND NOT FROM THE AUTHOR BUT IT IT PUTS ME IN A DILEMMA BECAUSE MY BIG PROBLEM WITH YOUR BILL. IS THAT [inaudible] HA. ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY RATES ARE ALREADY IN CALIFORNIA OVER AVERAGE. AND I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO FURTHER INCREASE THAT GAP BECAUSE I THINK IT MAKES LIVING IN CALIFORNIA EVEN LESS AFFORDABLE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE I REPRESENT ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING SO. A IT'S IT'S REFRESHING TO SEE SOMETHING THAT SAYS THERE WILL BE NO COST SHIFT BUT TO ME THAT'S AN IMPOSSIBILITY BECAUSE THE ELECTION THE UTILITY HAS TO RECOVER ITS COSTS BEFORE MANDATING. THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING A LOOK BELOW MARK ELECTRICITY THAT MONEY YOU KNOW WE COULD LEGISLATE THAT A COFFEE CUPS NOT A COFFEE CUP BUT YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S GOT TO BE A COFFEE CUP AT THE END OF THE YEAR. AYE I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING HOW THERE CAN'T BE SOME KIND OF COST SHIFT TO RECOVER THOSE FUNDS. WELL I AM EVER HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN ALWAYS FIND A WAY TO DO EXACTLY WHAT WE SAID WE WOULD DO AND IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE AMENDMENTS THAT SAY THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO COST* KASHIF THAT WE'RE GOING HAVE TO FIND WOULD NOT DO THAT. WELL WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY IT EITHER BAKE IT IN OR SOME OTHER MECHANISM OKAY WELL. RESPECTFULLY PACOLLI ONLY SEE TWO TWO POSSIBILITIES EITHER A CUSTOMER PAYS OR THE UTILITY PAYS [inaudible] AND THE THE ALL OF THE OTHER THAN THAT IT'S THERE'S THERE'S GOTTA COME FROM SOMEWHERE AND I I THINK I WOULD JUST RESPECTFULLY SAY THAT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. IF WE CONTINUE DOWN THE PATH WHERE YOU LIVE JUST AT OUTSIDE YOUR DISTRICTS JUST ATTACHED TO MINE AND WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE SOME OF THE WORST POLLUTION IN THE INLAND EMPIRE THAN ANYWHERE. IF WE DON'T FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE FOR THESE BUSES TO OPERATE ELECTRICALLY THEN WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO POLLUTE THE AREAS OF BOTH YOU AND I LIVE IN. AND MARK ARE A CONSTITUENTS LIVE AND WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE BIGGEST OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF ASTHMA IN THE INLAND EMPIRE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WILSON OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAS EXTREMELY HIGH RATES SO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT SO THAT WE CAN DO THE BEST WE CAN SURE A AND I THINK WE ARE ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT WE WANT. TO INCENTIVIZE THE PRODUCTION OF MORE TRANSIT THAT ZERO MISSION BUT JUST A QUESTION OF HOW WE GET THERE THAT WE'RE DEBATING TODAY ALWAYS THE QUESTION MR MATHIS. I I'M GONNA FIGURE SOME OF THE VICE CHAIRMAN'S CONCERNS HERE SENATOR -- THEN IN IRAQ WE HAVE A HUGE ASTHMA PROBLEM HE'S AIR QUALITY PROBLEM -- ESPECIALLY THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND BE YOU KNOW ONE OF MY CITIES PORTERVILLE -- BROUGHT AND GREEN BOSTON IS DOING ELECTRIC BUTTON AND FIGURED OUT A WAY. THEIR BUT WHEN WE USE TERMINOLOGY LIKE BAY CAN -- TO ME THAT'S JUST. SCREAMING THAT IT'S GONNA COST SHIFT TO SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND QUITE FRANKLY. YEAH YOU KNOW FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT ARE. AVERAGE INCOMES THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR. AND SUMMER ELECTRIC BILLS ALL OUR OVER FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. A LIMITED AND THAT JUST LIKE THAT TOO AND IN A CAUTIOUS THAT. YOU NOT QUITE FRANKLY YOU KNOW WHEN HAVE 24% CALIFORNIANS LIVING IN POVERTY A ANY THEIR CONCERN IS MORE SO KEEP IT COOL IN THEIR HOUSE AND KEEPING FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR THE KIDS. NINE IN OTHER INNER WEARING THEIR WORD ABOUT THE AIR BUT MEMORY ABOUT TAKING CARE THEIR FAMILY. BY IN THE LATE GREAT ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO PROVIDE A COST SHIFT IS IS. WORRISOME -- I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU AS IF YOUR BILL MOST FOR DAMN SURE YOU GOT YOUR VOTES TO DO IT -- MAYBE LOOK AT SOMETHING THAT WOULD INCENTIVIZE. THE COMPANY'S SAN AND GIVE THEM SOME KIND OF A TAX BREAK OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES -- WHAT WERE THEY GOING TO CREDIT BACK FOR DOING THIS SO INSTEAD OF SHIFTING THE COSTS OF THE ONE WHO I DON'T WILL MARKET SHIP WE WE CAN? POSSIBLY GIVE THESE COMPANIES A BREAK UP FOR DOING SOMETHING TO HELP US AS A STATE MOVE FOR TECHNOLOGICALLY. VERSE SAYS POSSIBLY HURTING THE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO HELP THAT TOTALLY AGREE LET ME BE CLEAR AGAIN WE ARE NOT LOOKING TO COST SHIFT I THINK THAT'S WHY THAT MY AMENDMENT WAS PUT INTO THE BILL. AND IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO LOOK OF INCENTIVE INCENTIVES ARE BETTER THE CARE IS BETTER THAN THE STICK AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE CARROT ON THE FLOOR BLAIR TOGETHER TO STICK SUMMIT STAND OFF THAT.
