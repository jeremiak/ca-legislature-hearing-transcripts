00:40:38.002 --> 00:40:39.737
IT SOUNDS LIKE WITH OPPOSITION

00:40:39.804 --> 00:40:41.005

00:40:52.716 --> 00:40:55.452
DETAILS THAT CAN BE WORKED OUT.

00:40:55.519 --> 00:40:56.020
AND THAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO

00:40:56.086 --> 00:40:57.755
HEAD TO THE SAME PLACE AT. THAT

00:40:57.822 --> 00:40:59.924
IS FAIR AND ALSO. BOTH OF THESE

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.391
INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.843
FOR THIS AND WE HAD TO AMEND

00:41:18.909 --> 00:41:19.810
BECAUSE THERE WAS CERTAIN

00:41:19.877 --> 00:41:21.378
THINGS WERE PROPRIETARY THAT WE

00:41:21.445 --> 00:41:23.347
DIDN'T AGREE WITH THAT WE THINK

00:41:23.414 --> 00:41:25.115
THEY SHOULD BE NOT JUST THEIR
