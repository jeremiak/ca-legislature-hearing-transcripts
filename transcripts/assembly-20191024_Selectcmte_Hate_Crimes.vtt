hate crimes three years ago in

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:44.910
response to the rice all pay

00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:45.511
crime through all the state of

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:46.812
California. In addition to

00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:48.881
myself to come meet he is make

00:10:48.948 --> 00:10:50.983
up of pan of my colleagues in

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.818
the California State Assembly

00:10:52.885 --> 00:10:54.920
one of them is here. And the

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:57.123
assembly select committee on

00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:58.891
hate crime serve as a tool to

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:02.661
foster community engagement and

00:11:02.728 --> 00:11:04.563
open dialogue. And

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.599
collaboration of ethnic and

00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:08.701
religious organizations LGBT Q.

00:11:08.768 --> 00:11:14.740
groups law enforcement number

00:11:14.807 --> 00:11:16.575
profit and other organizations.

00:11:16.642 --> 00:11:20.646
As much as California has drive

00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:21.113
to inclusive. And to

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.217
progressive we still have the

00:11:25.284 --> 00:11:26.952
highest number of hay group.

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:30.589
The sharp increase in hate and

00:11:30.656 --> 00:11:32.992
bullying related crimes even

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:35.027
sold those crimes are generally

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:38.697
under reported. So I aid

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:41.000
requested audit by the state

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:44.670
auditor other hate crying in

00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:46.839
California we have do we

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:50.543
receive the result in may of

00:11:50.609 --> 00:11:52.545
twenty eighteen include- and

00:11:52.611 --> 00:11:53.079
the result from the audit

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:55.014
report of were very

00:11:55.081 --> 00:11:56.715
disappointing but not

00:11:56.782 --> 00:11:59.118
surprising. Hey crime were on

00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:03.022
the rise yet our state auditor

00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:06.926
fall many- when. Under reported

00:12:06.992 --> 00:12:10.796
I reported so due to a variety

00:12:10.863 --> 00:12:11.397
of reasons including the lack

00:12:11.464 --> 00:12:14.967
of awareness training and trust

00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:19.071
between the community and the

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:20.739
law enforcement. So in order to

00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:22.942
protect our community and

00:12:23.008 --> 00:12:25.144
captured appropriate date. We

00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:26.812
need stronger policies and

00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:29.048
implementation of bills

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:32.551
policies across the state. This

00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:34.854
year I have authors for bills

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.123
god to deal with to protection

00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:38.791
from hate crime us should a

00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:40.826
trying to implement some of two

00:12:40.893 --> 00:12:42.862
recommendation from there a

00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:48.734
report. They didn't it did take

00:12:48.801 --> 00:12:50.903
up- didn't go too far I didn't

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.974
not talk go very far the- AB

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.809
thrill one. Of both a hate

00:12:56.876 --> 00:12:58.811
crime data collection and all

00:12:58.878 --> 00:13:00.913
reach bill. And there will have

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.683
mandate the repeal of all law

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.652
enforcement agencies. Every

00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:08.721
three years to your value a

00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:10.923
their accuracy of the hate

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:14.760
crime data an agency Hey crime

00:13:14.827 --> 00:13:16.629
policies because they law

00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:18.898
changes road road we got. A

00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:21.167
rather the regarding to the

00:13:21.233 --> 00:13:22.668
hate crime I wanna make sure

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:25.671
that all the- his officers a

00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:28.974
get hated. On the most current

00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:32.978
a hate crime law. AB fifteen oh

00:13:33.045 --> 00:13:35.080
two which is a bill that would

00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:35.648
require peace officers to

00:13:35.714 --> 00:13:38.684
receive initial and ongoing

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:40.953
training. On how to deal with a

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.757
crime. Es de all did I mention

00:13:44.823 --> 00:13:47.059
earlier found that under

00:13:47.126 --> 00:13:50.563
reporting. Work harder- partly

00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:52.598
due to the lack of updated

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:54.700
training so among make short I.

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:56.702
R. peace officer receive

00:13:56.769 --> 00:14:00.806
adequate training. To deal with

00:14:00.873 --> 00:14:02.641
this is a very important issue.

00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:04.977
Unfortunately those bill didn't

00:14:05.044 --> 00:14:07.146
really make it into law.

00:14:07.213 --> 00:14:10.716
Partially because this state

00:14:10.783 --> 00:14:12.685
legislature this year we have a

00:14:12.751 --> 00:14:16.488
police involved shooting bail

00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:18.724
of what we're trying to. And

00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:22.728
that really trying to change

00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:24.730
the police officer's own own

00:14:24.797 --> 00:14:28.667
use of extreme force or use of

00:14:28.734 --> 00:14:31.403
force in general. So that a put

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:36.609
a lot of. Of a burden responses

00:14:36.675 --> 00:14:38.978
for. The you post police

00:14:39.044 --> 00:14:41.013
officers standard training

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.581
which is a organization there

00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:44.783
are responsible to provide a of

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.785
the materials and the training

00:14:46.852 --> 00:14:50.723
for de um of peace office so

00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:52.558
they did oppose from pretty

00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:54.727
much to say well we're we don't

00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:56.729
have enough capacity. The van

00:14:56.795 --> 00:15:02.601
was to do to do more of the-

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:04.803
training materials and pro by a

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.672
training to our- of peace

00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:09.174
officers up and down the

00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:12.578
California so their own but I'm

00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:14.613
not I haven't given up on those

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.082
ideas yet. So next year I would

00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:20.919
be- willing to- work with my

00:15:20.986 --> 00:15:24.657
colleagues here and continue

00:15:24.723 --> 00:15:26.859
push him for about her

00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:32.631
the peace officers to address

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:36.802
this the. Escalating problem in

00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:42.841
our state. Often so another

00:15:42.908 --> 00:15:44.810
another legislative late

00:15:44.877 --> 00:15:46.712
another legislative idea which

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.981
I really clean cannot claim

00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:49.615
credit. Because I know many of

00:15:49.682 --> 00:15:51.016
the cities and the counties and

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:54.553
California have adopted this

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.789
compassionate other a

00:15:56.855 --> 00:15:59.124
resolution. So I wanted to make

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:01.293
California the first state in

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.630
the United States. That adopt

00:16:04.697 --> 00:16:06.832
this compassionate resolution

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:08.934
which world declared California

00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:11.070
V. the pot compassionate to

00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:14.940
stay in in the United States of

00:16:15.007 --> 00:16:17.009
America. That's my is C. R. one

00:16:17.076 --> 00:16:18.977
little eight. Were brought to

00:16:19.044 --> 00:16:20.679
vote connect your in the

00:16:20.746 --> 00:16:22.948
assembly and is one of the

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:24.850
important reason why we are

00:16:24.917 --> 00:16:26.885
here. Today to host those

00:16:26.952 --> 00:16:31.123
hearing. Making California- and

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:31.724
compassionate state is not an

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:36.528
idea. And I can claim image

00:16:36.595 --> 00:16:38.530
credit I wanted to the thank.

00:16:38.597 --> 00:16:40.866
The city of Fremont you know

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:45.003
that we have. The adopt this

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:46.839
I'd this to a- resolution

00:16:46.905 --> 00:16:50.976
earlier you know- but as the

00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:55.047
Buddhist myself. It will have a

00:16:55.114 --> 00:16:58.717
Hindu hater. Compassionate is

00:16:58.784 --> 00:17:00.753
to read a way of life. I don't

00:17:00.819 --> 00:17:01.453
think we can step out hate with

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.656
Dahle compassion. And being

00:17:04.723 --> 00:17:06.759
genuine to our approach. This

00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:10.829
is a ball treating others was.

00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:15.000
Empathy with respect and

00:17:15.067 --> 00:17:18.470
putting effort into being hi.

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:20.806
It is such a fortunate thing

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:24.643
that our district is so diverse

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:25.177
I love to brag about this

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:28.747
diverse city anyone anywhere I

00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:31.116
go and I think that along with

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:34.820
a great policy ideas. There is

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:37.389
a lot of room for us to be

00:17:37.456 --> 00:17:40.893
kinder to each other in order

00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:42.795
to prevent and a drop the

00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:44.696
hatred that is spreading

00:17:44.763 --> 00:17:47.032
rapidly around our nation. And

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:50.669
today we will be hearing from

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:52.738

00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:06.919

it would not just be and an

00:18:50.863 --> 00:18:51.263
excellent advocate for

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.498
education before hosting us- a

00:18:52.564 --> 00:18:54.833
this evening as well as a-

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.969

the many students I know I

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:05.344
always enjoyed me without the

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:06.945
other students here. And I've

00:19:07.012 --> 00:19:08.780
enjoyed also seen them the

00:19:08.847 --> 00:19:09.381
student the climate strike as

00:19:09.448 --> 00:19:11.116
well and I appreciate the

00:19:11.183 --> 00:19:13.252
advocacy overseeing for young

00:19:13.318 --> 00:19:13.852
people in the for them to be

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:14.786
here I think is really

00:19:14.853 --> 00:19:18.557
important- and the- the

00:19:18.624 --> 00:19:20.893
panelists. And I want to get to

00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:22.728
the palace in the good thing is

00:19:22.794 --> 00:19:23.328
that you have about thirteen

00:19:23.395 --> 00:19:24.830
minutes each usually you got to

00:19:24.897 --> 00:19:25.464
Sacramento if you have one or

00:19:25.531 --> 00:19:26.932
two minutes so I'm glad we have

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:28.667
a chance you actually to finish

00:19:28.734 --> 00:19:30.569
some thoughts. As you- as you

00:19:30.636 --> 00:19:32.638
present- but we have an all

00:19:32.704 --> 00:19:34.873
star panel here that I've known

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.975
many of them for many years. I

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:38.544
certainly compassionate and

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.646
very thoughtful leaders so I'm

00:19:40.712 --> 00:19:43.015
so grateful that you're all

00:19:43.081 --> 00:19:43.582
you're not able to represent

00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:44.883
this community but as a Kansen

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.919
said it's very diverse

00:19:46.985 --> 00:19:48.887
community I think it's a very

00:19:48.954 --> 00:19:49.488
loving community. But we also

00:19:49.555 --> 00:19:51.089
have our challenges are always

00:19:51.156 --> 00:19:52.658
important for us to engage and

00:19:52.724 --> 00:19:54.826
talk with one another and be

00:19:54.893 --> 00:19:57.162
that. Model for the rest of the

00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:58.997
state especially as- it is

00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:00.699
Kansen moves forward with

00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:03.168
passion California resident

00:20:03.235 --> 00:20:04.703
Xin. I only talk about

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.972
compassionate California that

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:09.074
are being compassionate to be

00:20:09.141 --> 00:20:10.642
apart and should be what woven

00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:11.243
into everything we do whether

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:15.013
it's budgets- whether it policy

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:15.547
or whether it's community

00:20:15.614 --> 00:20:17.249
advocacy and so that's why. I'm

00:20:17.316 --> 00:20:28.527
very grateful to Kansen Chu up.

00:20:28.594 --> 00:20:38.637
A chair of the select committee.

00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:41.306
Thank you thank Kansen Chu so

00:20:41.373 --> 00:20:42.808
much. His compassionate

00:20:42.874 --> 00:20:44.943
leadership- which will

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:46.979
certainly be missed a state

00:20:47.045 --> 00:20:50.749
legislature but it's not going

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:51.383
anywhere because he's not going

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:54.686
anywhere. And I won a. This is

00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:55.320
a you know get a Kansen days

00:20:55.387 --> 00:20:56.955
were always going to have them

00:20:57.022 --> 00:20:57.456
as part of our community

00:20:57.522 --> 00:20:58.557
sharing that compassion love it

00:20:58.624 --> 00:21:00.692
so I want to thank Kansen and I

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:01.259
look forward to hearing from

00:21:01.326 --> 00:21:04.696
our panelists. All right thank

00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:06.732
you AJ. And vice mayor. Thank

00:21:06.798 --> 00:21:12.938
you. Very well then. Good

00:21:13.005 --> 00:21:13.538
evening assembly member is-

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:15.140
honor to be here- I really

00:21:15.207 --> 00:21:16.808
appreciate you taking the lead

00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:17.309
on this- compassionate.

00:21:17.376 --> 00:21:21.013
California which is one. I in

00:21:21.079 --> 00:21:21.613
Fremont we are fortunate to

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.017
have passed the- compassionate

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:27.152
Fremont charter. And basically

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:28.820
that's relies on the golden

00:21:28.887 --> 00:21:31.523
rule which is everybody wants

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:32.791
treated equally. And at that we

00:21:32.858 --> 00:21:34.926
take care of our fellow

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:40.932
members. And. And so- it's very

00:21:40.999 --> 00:21:41.566
I need to be some of the hate

00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:43.068
crimes are happening a lot of

00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:44.703
them started for example nine

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.272
then- many of our Sikh

00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:47.873
Americans suffered a lot of

00:21:47.939 --> 00:21:49.508
hate crimes and have because of

00:21:49.574 --> 00:21:50.575
the misperceptions. And just

00:21:50.642 --> 00:21:52.911
recently in Sunnyvale we also

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:54.613
had a hate crime which was a

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.180
Hindu American was targeted

00:21:55.247 --> 00:21:57.282
because it up they were of

00:21:57.349 --> 00:21:58.884
Muslim. And so on only a lot of

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:01.086
these are fear based- crimes

00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:04.990
or- you know tribalism and also

00:22:05.057 --> 00:22:06.591
a mental health issues and so-

00:22:06.658 --> 00:22:08.927
I definitely believe that the

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:09.494
state needs to have better

00:22:09.561 --> 00:22:12.531
reporting- and I appreciate the

00:22:12.597 --> 00:22:14.933
assembly member for- I trying

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.735
to pass this new- law. Which

00:22:16.802 --> 00:22:18.970
will allow for better a

00:22:19.037 --> 00:22:21.306
classification of the crimes by

00:22:21.373 --> 00:22:22.841
the police department and also

00:22:22.908 --> 00:22:25.210
be logged in better in the

00:22:25.277 --> 00:22:26.912
department of justice serving

00:22:26.978 --> 00:22:28.880
classify the a hate crimes

00:22:28.947 --> 00:22:29.514
better than we can actually do

00:22:29.581 --> 00:22:31.149
something about that so I

00:22:31.216 --> 00:22:32.718
definitely command. Our leaders

00:22:32.784 --> 00:22:34.720

00:23:52.964 --> 00:23:54.466
the reasons why we're grateful

00:23:54.533 --> 00:23:55.100
to have the opportunity to host

00:23:55.167 --> 00:23:56.935
this type of event because we

00:23:57.002 --> 00:23:59.070
deal with- hate crimes in a

00:23:59.137 --> 00:24:02.841
very different way. It's where

00:24:02.908 --> 00:24:03.408
and in the school system is

00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:04.776
called bullying. And so the

00:24:04.843 --> 00:24:06.678
fact that this is being hosted

00:24:06.745 --> 00:24:07.312
here will be able to share it

00:24:07.379 --> 00:24:08.914
with our students with our

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.882
teachers. With our leaders and

00:24:10.949 --> 00:24:11.383
saying that we have an

00:24:11.449 --> 00:24:13.018
opportunity in a role to play

00:24:13.084 --> 00:24:15.120
as we create as we work with

00:24:15.187 --> 00:24:16.788
the development of our young

00:24:16.855 --> 00:24:18.890
people. If we can help reduce

00:24:18.957 --> 00:24:20.826
bullying we should believe that

00:24:20.892 --> 00:24:21.426
there's a correlating affect

00:24:21.493 --> 00:24:23.028
that we should help reduce hate

00:24:23.094 --> 00:24:24.863
crimes. So I'm very excited to

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:25.397
be here to listen to this

00:24:25.463 --> 00:24:26.731
distinguished group of

00:24:26.798 --> 00:24:27.299
panelists. And look for the

00:24:27.365 --> 00:24:30.735
evening. Thank you. Thank you

time okay will die and be

00:24:52.924 --> 00:24:56.595
patient. We'll get to you. Good

00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:58.697
evening ladies and gentlemen-

00:24:58.763 --> 00:25:00.999
my name is tÁi here on water

00:25:01.066 --> 00:25:02.634
I'm here on behalf of the

00:25:02.701 --> 00:25:03.235
Muslim community here in the

00:25:03.301 --> 00:25:06.705
South Bay- I'd like to begin by

00:25:06.771 --> 00:25:08.940
thanking assembly member Chiu

00:25:09.007 --> 00:25:10.809
for facilitating this. And of

00:25:10.876 --> 00:25:12.644
course the rest of my friends-

00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:13.278
right in front and on the panel

00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:18.884
as well. I've got thirteen

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:19.484
minutes for an imam thirteen

00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:20.018
this is actually very very

00:25:20.085 --> 00:25:25.090
little. But and because of the

00:25:25.156 --> 00:25:26.725
topic that I've been assigned-

00:25:26.791 --> 00:25:29.094
I'm gonna be very theological

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.862
if I may and so I'm gonna free

00:25:30.929 --> 00:25:32.664
I ask for your forgiveness and

00:25:32.731 --> 00:25:34.499
hands for that. But with that

00:25:34.566 --> 00:25:35.066
said I'm hoping I don't take

00:25:35.133 --> 00:25:36.968
the entire thirty minutes but

00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:38.570
don't be surprised if I do- the

00:25:38.637 --> 00:25:40.572
question that was asked is in

00:25:40.639 --> 00:25:42.774
our religion and our faith how

00:25:42.841 --> 00:25:44.709
do we promote inclusivity and

00:25:44.776 --> 00:25:46.678
compassion towards others- as a

00:25:46.745 --> 00:25:50.715
Muslim- I turn to of course.

00:25:50.782 --> 00:25:53.285
The holy text as as Muslims we

00:25:53.351 --> 00:25:56.554
turn to the Koran first and

00:25:56.621 --> 00:25:58.590
then we turn to the traditions

00:25:58.657 --> 00:25:59.190
of the prophet Muhammad peace

00:25:59.257 --> 00:26:00.992
be upon him and I'm gonna spend

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:01.626
a few minutes. Just speaking

00:26:01.693 --> 00:26:04.763
about that- the Koran we

00:26:04.829 --> 00:26:05.297
believe has a hundred and

00:26:05.363 --> 00:26:06.965
fourteen chapters and except

00:26:07.032 --> 00:26:08.800
for one of them- every single

00:26:08.867 --> 00:26:10.802
one of them begins with in the

00:26:10.869 --> 00:26:11.269
name of god the most

00:26:11.336 --> 00:26:12.737
compassionate the most

00:26:12.804 --> 00:26:14.572
merciful. So that's the first

00:26:14.639 --> 00:26:15.140
verse in the Koran we talk

00:26:15.206 --> 00:26:18.677
about compassion and mercy- if

00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:20.679
we- look at of course the Koran

00:26:20.745 --> 00:26:21.279
is about the size of the Old

00:26:21.346 --> 00:26:24.916
Testament which I spent two

00:26:24.983 --> 00:26:25.483
years of my life memorizing

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:26.785
from cover to cover. And my son

00:26:26.851 --> 00:26:28.920
is done next until the fourth

00:26:28.987 --> 00:26:30.622
generation who has memorized it

00:26:30.689 --> 00:26:32.457
from cover to cover- but

00:26:32.524 --> 00:26:34.960
there's for have topics that

00:26:35.026 --> 00:26:36.628
are heavily stressed- in the

00:26:36.695 --> 00:26:38.797
Koran compassion. Of

00:26:38.863 --> 00:26:42.701
benevolence justice and wisdom.

00:26:42.767 --> 00:26:43.301
And all of these have to do

00:26:43.368 --> 00:26:46.504
with things that where- dealing

00:26:46.571 --> 00:26:47.072
with today in fact there's a

00:26:47.138 --> 00:26:48.907
direct versus the Koran were

00:26:48.974 --> 00:26:50.875
god says my mercy encompasses

00:26:50.942 --> 00:26:54.879
all things we are reminded in

00:26:54.946 --> 00:26:56.748
our tradition that mercy being

00:26:56.815 --> 00:26:58.650
merciful is intrinsic. As to

00:26:58.717 --> 00:26:59.317
who we are as human beings in

00:26:59.384 --> 00:27:00.952
fact the Arabic word era

00:27:01.019 --> 00:27:02.721
because not my mother tongue

00:27:02.787 --> 00:27:04.990
just for the record my parents

00:27:05.056 --> 00:27:05.623
are from India I learned Arabic

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:08.860
much later in my life- the word

00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:10.895
for wound. In the Arabic

00:27:10.962 --> 00:27:14.666
language is awesome- and I'm

00:27:14.733 --> 00:27:16.601
actually literally means mercy

00:27:16.668 --> 00:27:17.202
and that's where members we

00:27:17.268 --> 00:27:18.803
built we believe in our

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.505
tradition where mercy begins

00:27:20.572 --> 00:27:22.540
the love between the compassion

00:27:22.607 --> 00:27:23.174
the love between the mother and

00:27:23.241 --> 00:27:24.809
the child which then gets

00:27:24.876 --> 00:27:26.745
passed on to. The community

00:27:26.811 --> 00:27:29.114
there's two verses in the Koran

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.082
that I want to share portions

00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:32.851
of the verses that I want to

00:27:32.917 --> 00:27:35.120
share in this these are sort

00:27:35.186 --> 00:27:36.921
of- Guiding. Light for us in

00:27:36.988 --> 00:27:41.026
our tradition- god says in

00:27:41.092 --> 00:27:43.061
chapter forty nine let not a

00:27:43.128 --> 00:27:44.829
people ready killing other

00:27:44.896 --> 00:27:45.397
people perhaps they may be

00:27:45.463 --> 00:27:48.433
better than them. Nor let women

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.635
ready kill other women perhaps

00:27:50.702 --> 00:27:51.269
they may be better than that

00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:52.737
and do not insult one another

00:27:52.804 --> 00:27:54.906
and do not call each other by

00:27:54.973 --> 00:27:57.042
offensive nicknames the Koran

00:27:57.108 --> 00:27:58.777
is very very clear about just

00:27:58.843 --> 00:28:00.879
calling others by names are

00:28:00.945 --> 00:28:01.312
making fun of other

00:28:01.379 --> 00:28:02.947
individuals. Let alone hurting

00:28:03.014 --> 00:28:05.150
them right one is to make fun

00:28:05.216 --> 00:28:07.085
of someone and then the other

00:28:07.152 --> 00:28:10.822
is to bully them or a hate

00:28:10.889 --> 00:28:11.423
crime and that sort of the

00:28:11.489 --> 00:28:13.158
foundation. As far as you know

00:28:13.224 --> 00:28:15.026
we've been talking about I've

00:28:15.093 --> 00:28:16.594
I've lived in the Silicon

00:28:16.661 --> 00:28:17.195
Valley I've lived in San Jose

00:28:17.262 --> 00:28:20.932
for- thirty seven years now- we

00:28:20.999 --> 00:28:22.667
talk about a very diverse

00:28:22.734 --> 00:28:24.969
community how to Muslims deal

00:28:25.036 --> 00:28:27.072
with diversity- if you've been

00:28:27.138 --> 00:28:28.940
to any. Muslim of you know

00:28:29.007 --> 00:28:29.541
there's a verse of the Koran

00:28:29.607 --> 00:28:32.644
that is often cited an off

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:33.244
shared we've created you from

00:28:33.311 --> 00:28:35.013
male female did you people in

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.948
tribes so that you may know one

00:28:37.015 --> 00:28:39.350
another. Indeed the most noble

00:28:39.417 --> 00:28:42.954
of you the sight of god is the

00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:43.555
most righteous of you. And so

00:28:43.621 --> 00:28:48.960
we. He our tradition believe in

00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:49.527
diversity we believe that

00:28:49.594 --> 00:28:50.161
people are going to be diverse.

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:52.797
Act traditionally as Muslims-

00:28:52.864 --> 00:28:54.532
when we refer to individuals-

00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:56.734
as a sign of remembering that

00:28:56.801 --> 00:28:57.402
you're known by the name of the

00:28:57.469 --> 00:28:58.536
town that you're from so in

00:28:58.603 --> 00:29:00.939
fact one of the- some of the

00:29:01.005 --> 00:29:04.742
most. Up with resourceful books

00:29:04.809 --> 00:29:06.678
that we have in our tradition

00:29:06.744 --> 00:29:07.345
are so for example let me give

00:29:07.412 --> 00:29:08.947
you an example one of the

00:29:09.013 --> 00:29:10.715
collections of the traditions

00:29:10.782 --> 00:29:11.316
of the prophet Muhammad which

00:29:11.382 --> 00:29:12.684
is really really famous. Is the

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:15.120
individual's name no one knows

00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:16.588
about his name they know ms

00:29:16.654 --> 00:29:19.190
Behati. The reason they known

00:29:19.257 --> 00:29:19.824
as bodies because he's from the

00:29:19.891 --> 00:29:22.961
town of bajada. And similarly.

00:29:23.027 --> 00:29:24.462
You know when I was studying-

00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:27.065
my I'd no one ever knew my last

00:29:27.132 --> 00:29:29.167
name my last name was a many

00:29:29.234 --> 00:29:32.804
key. The American. Yeah that's

00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:33.438
that's very interesting and so

00:29:33.505 --> 00:29:36.641
we when we talk about diversity

00:29:36.708 --> 00:29:37.275
diversity is intrinsic to who

00:29:37.342 --> 00:29:40.845
we are but we are one family we

00:29:40.912 --> 00:29:42.680
are one family as a people of

00:29:42.747 --> 00:29:43.281
our faith and we're also one

00:29:43.348 --> 00:29:47.185
family as humanity. We turn to

00:29:47.252 --> 00:29:47.785
the traditions of the prophet

00:29:47.852 --> 00:29:48.386
Muhammad and this is something

00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:50.555
which is- you know a very

00:29:50.622 --> 00:29:51.122
commonly mentioned in every

00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:52.924
every religion has sort of a

00:29:52.991 --> 00:29:54.759
saying around this in in our

00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:56.594
tradition we remind ourselves.

00:29:56.661 --> 00:29:58.696
No one truly believes until

00:29:58.763 --> 00:29:59.297
they desire for their brother

00:29:59.364 --> 00:30:00.932
or sister with a desire for

00:30:00.999 --> 00:30:03.034
themself in other words if you

00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:05.203
want peace mercy compassion for

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:08.740
yourself that's what you you if

00:30:08.806 --> 00:30:09.274
you're not a perfect human

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.808
being unless otherwise you

00:30:10.875 --> 00:30:11.342
desire that for the other

00:30:11.409 --> 00:30:12.944
individual. And a lot of times

00:30:13.011 --> 00:30:14.946
my kids are a little older now

00:30:15.013 --> 00:30:16.848
when they understand but when I

00:30:16.915 --> 00:30:18.883
was younger- my children sorry

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:20.685
when my children sorry when I

00:30:20.752 --> 00:30:22.620
well when I was younger too but

00:30:22.687 --> 00:30:23.254
when my children. Were younger

00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:24.923
and they wouldn't see me at

00:30:24.989 --> 00:30:26.791
home in the evening and some of

00:30:26.858 --> 00:30:28.960
you who've known me in the room

00:30:29.027 --> 00:30:29.594
no that I was a great advocate

00:30:29.661 --> 00:30:31.196
needs senior a lot of different

00:30:31.262 --> 00:30:33.031
places. My children ask and say

00:30:33.097 --> 00:30:34.866
why and I would really believe

00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:38.770
and I tell- individuals that

00:30:38.836 --> 00:30:39.470
you know I San Jose is home for

00:30:39.537 --> 00:30:40.772
me California is home for me

00:30:40.838 --> 00:30:42.674
the United States is home for

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:46.711
me and my religion. Teaches me

00:30:46.778 --> 00:30:48.546
too sure that my home my and

00:30:48.613 --> 00:30:51.216
remains a safe place and so it

00:30:51.282 --> 00:30:54.819
is my faith. That drives me to

00:30:54.886 --> 00:30:56.888
go up there not to convert

00:30:56.955 --> 00:30:59.057
people very clear about that is

00:30:59.123 --> 00:31:00.692
not I'm not do and you know

00:31:00.758 --> 00:31:01.326
that you know I'm not here to

00:31:01.392 --> 00:31:03.027
proselytize I don't do my work

00:31:03.094 --> 00:31:04.963
to proselytize I'm here to do

00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:06.864
my work because that's I feel

00:31:06.931 --> 00:31:09.234
that it's an obligation on me

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.069
as an individual. To ensure

00:31:11.135 --> 00:31:12.670
that I do my part for my

00:31:12.737 --> 00:31:14.739
community that. You know we

00:31:14.806 --> 00:31:16.808
don't hate you and we don't

00:31:16.874 --> 00:31:18.710
hate each other and when we

00:31:18.776 --> 00:31:20.745
talk about hating each other

00:31:20.812 --> 00:31:23.014
you can't you know sometimes

00:31:23.081 --> 00:31:24.616
when you don't know someone-

00:31:24.682 --> 00:31:27.118
you may hate them but you may

00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:28.586
still be a wonder around them

00:31:28.653 --> 00:31:32.957
right who. Are they what are

00:31:33.024 --> 00:31:38.997
they do it took a I've. I've

00:31:39.063 --> 00:31:39.631
lived in San Jose for. Of a

00:31:39.697 --> 00:31:40.598
number of years now and I'm for

00:31:40.665 --> 00:31:41.199
some of my neighbors it took

00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:44.636
them a little while to warm up

00:31:44.702 --> 00:31:45.270
to me. I'm gonna be honest with

00:31:45.336 --> 00:31:45.837
you this and as a for god's

00:31:45.903 --> 00:31:47.005
sake. You know they couldn't

00:31:47.071 --> 00:31:47.605
figure out who I was when they

00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:48.206
figured out it was Muslim. You

00:31:48.273 --> 00:31:48.973
know you it's like okay what do

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.508
you do inside your house. Of

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:51.175
until they saw my kids playing

00:31:51.242 --> 00:31:52.910
outside and running outside in

00:31:52.977 --> 00:31:54.912
me playing ball my kids and so

00:31:54.979 --> 00:31:57.015
on and so forth it's sort of. A

00:31:57.081 --> 00:31:58.783
humanize me. Around my

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:01.152
neighbors- but I didn't do that

00:32:01.219 --> 00:32:03.521
for my neighbors I did that for

00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:04.155
my own self I did that because

00:32:04.222 --> 00:32:06.991
my faith teaches me to be

00:32:07.058 --> 00:32:08.760
compassionate. And to be. Nine

00:32:08.826 --> 00:32:10.561
towards the individuals around

00:32:10.628 --> 00:32:12.997
be. I just want to share a few

00:32:13.064 --> 00:32:13.598
traditions. From the prophet

00:32:13.665 --> 00:32:17.068
Mohammed- this is of course

00:32:17.135 --> 00:32:19.103
this is fourteen hundred years

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:19.737
ago a man came to the prophet

00:32:19.804 --> 00:32:22.407
Muhammad said- profit I have

00:32:22.473 --> 00:32:23.041
ten sons and I've never kissed

00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:24.942
any of them. The profit looked

00:32:25.009 --> 00:32:26.678
at looked at him and said he

00:32:26.744 --> 00:32:27.278
who has no compassion will

00:32:27.345 --> 00:32:29.180
receive none. Right when you

00:32:29.247 --> 00:32:30.848
talk about compassion this is

00:32:30.915 --> 00:32:32.717
directly from the teacher the

00:32:32.784 --> 00:32:33.318
prophet Mohammad. The prophet

00:32:33.384 --> 00:32:34.986
Muhammad is narrated to have

00:32:35.053 --> 00:32:36.988
said. A kind word or even a

00:32:37.055 --> 00:32:38.723
smile is a form of charity.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:39.257
Serve muscles are walking

00:32:39.324 --> 00:32:42.627
around smiling. It's because

00:32:42.694 --> 00:32:44.829
you know we're being charitable

00:32:44.896 --> 00:32:45.396
and if we're not. Tell us to

00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:49.100
smile. We talk about we talk

00:32:49.167 --> 00:32:51.035
you know we begin with we begin

00:32:51.102 --> 00:32:51.602
with home we talk about our

00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:52.837
neighbors- it there's a

00:32:52.904 --> 00:32:54.972
tradition of the prophet

00:32:55.039 --> 00:32:56.708
Muhammad that says. That you're

00:32:56.774 --> 00:32:58.910
not a complete believer. Unless

00:32:58.976 --> 00:33:00.778
you've ensured that forty of

00:33:00.845 --> 00:33:01.312
your neighbors all of your

00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:04.615
neighbors have. Been fed. And

00:33:04.682 --> 00:33:06.584
so they went to the prophet

00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:07.185
Muhammad and similar to other

00:33:07.251 --> 00:33:09.053
religious traditions all they

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:09.620
would probably moms of any

00:33:09.687 --> 00:33:10.955
neighbors at forty homes. Forty

00:33:11.022 --> 00:33:12.890
homes I don't know forty my

00:33:12.957 --> 00:33:14.992
neighbors and is going to be

00:33:15.059 --> 00:33:16.794
honest with you. But not yet.

00:33:16.861 --> 00:33:18.796
But but I mean that's that's

00:33:18.863 --> 00:33:20.631
that's our tradition in fact.

00:33:20.698 --> 00:33:22.734
There's so much in our in our

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.602
tradition around the rights. Of

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:26.637
neighbors. That of the

00:33:26.704 --> 00:33:29.073
companions his his companions

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.875
later on said that the prophet

00:33:30.942 --> 00:33:32.643
Muhammad would mention that are

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:33.244
the rights of neighbors so

00:33:33.311 --> 00:33:34.812
much. That we thought they

00:33:34.879 --> 00:33:37.014
would actually inherit from us

00:33:37.081 --> 00:33:38.516
when we would pass- that's

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:39.117
that's when we talk about so

00:33:39.183 --> 00:33:40.852
that's that's part of my

00:33:40.918 --> 00:33:42.587
tradition and my religion now

00:33:42.653 --> 00:33:44.622
of course. I can I can say so

00:33:44.689 --> 00:33:45.189
much more but I'm I'm gonna

00:33:45.256 --> 00:33:47.058
stop with that piece. As

00:33:47.125 --> 00:33:50.828
Muslims up you know. Muslims

00:33:50.895 --> 00:33:51.462
came to americana to what a lot

00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:54.766
of people believe. Since came

00:33:54.832 --> 00:33:56.534
to America with Columbus.

00:33:56.601 --> 00:33:57.135
Muslims came to the Americas-

00:33:57.201 --> 00:33:59.003
during slave trade to the all

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:01.005
of America's so we've been

00:34:01.072 --> 00:34:04.575
here. For a very very long time

00:34:04.642 --> 00:34:05.176
there's entire- books written

00:34:05.243 --> 00:34:06.911
on this topic if you're

00:34:06.978 --> 00:34:08.946
interested in reading about it

00:34:09.013 --> 00:34:09.547
I can share some names with

00:34:09.614 --> 00:34:10.948
you- a lot of the immigrant.

00:34:11.015 --> 00:34:12.884
Push sort of came in the

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:13.384
fifties and sixties and

00:34:13.451 --> 00:34:15.319
seventies. Where people like my

00:34:15.386 --> 00:34:18.790
parents came out here- for you

00:34:18.856 --> 00:34:21.359
know to get an education to. Be

00:34:21.426 --> 00:34:22.927
a part of this community and

00:34:22.994 --> 00:34:25.263
they made this land home. So

00:34:25.329 --> 00:34:27.165
people still me sometimes and

00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:27.765
think I don't speak a word of

00:34:27.832 --> 00:34:30.868
English. I actually speak

00:34:30.935 --> 00:34:32.804
English in about four one

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:33.404
accents and I do them all very

00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:38.843
well. But what you know as so

00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:40.645
you know our Moscow our mosque

00:34:40.711 --> 00:34:42.613
in San Jose is operating our

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.549
fortieth anniversary next year

00:34:44.615 --> 00:34:46.818
that's our fortieth formal

00:34:46.884 --> 00:34:47.418
anniversary we've been around

00:34:47.485 --> 00:34:49.387
for about five years. Before

00:34:49.454 --> 00:34:50.588
that one of the things some of

00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:51.189
the things that we do in our

00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:52.990
community we get a lot of

00:34:53.057 --> 00:34:54.659
community service health click

00:34:54.725 --> 00:34:56.861
soup kitchens- if you come our

00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:58.930
our sermons are on Friday

00:34:58.996 --> 00:35:00.731
they're open to the entire

00:35:00.798 --> 00:35:01.399
community we you know it's not

00:35:01.466 --> 00:35:04.435
like. If someone else walks in

00:35:04.502 --> 00:35:05.036
from a different community the

00:35:05.102 --> 00:35:06.571
imam pulls out another sermon I

00:35:06.637 --> 00:35:08.439
always joke about it right the

00:35:08.506 --> 00:35:10.641
sermons are for everyone- and a

00:35:10.708 --> 00:35:13.077
lot of what we discussed in our

00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:14.745
sermons is community service is

00:35:14.812 --> 00:35:18.583
compassion is mercy. Is how to.

00:35:18.649 --> 00:35:20.952
Be kind to those around you

00:35:21.018 --> 00:35:23.154
combine to even those who are

00:35:23.221 --> 00:35:24.956
not kind to you in return

00:35:25.022 --> 00:35:26.991
that's what my faith teaches

00:35:27.058 --> 00:35:30.828
people- now. If some people of

00:35:30.895 --> 00:35:34.999
my faith choose not to do that

00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:35.633
you can't hold me responsible

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.903
for that- if. Certain media

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.972
outlet may want to cover

00:35:41.038 --> 00:35:42.840
certain things in a different

00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:45.042
way well there's only so much

00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:49.080
that I can do. About that- but

00:35:49.146 --> 00:35:50.748
you know the things any evil

00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:52.884
act that's being done in the

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:54.552
world in in the name of my

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:55.186
faith or the name of any faith

00:35:55.253 --> 00:35:57.088
for that matter anyone will

00:35:57.154 --> 00:35:58.623
tell you that. That's not

00:35:58.689 --> 00:36:00.958
correct- that's not how it's

00:36:01.025 --> 00:36:04.662
going to be- yeah I know I told

00:36:04.729 --> 00:36:05.263
you I wasn't a mom I take the

00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:10.868
full thirteen minutes. You can

00:36:10.935 --> 00:36:15.039
that's okay. I'm just gonna I'm

00:36:15.106 --> 00:36:15.673
really quickly I'm gonna close-

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:16.741
up the hate crimes against

00:36:16.807 --> 00:36:18.609
Muslims of course is not just

00:36:18.676 --> 00:36:20.912
on a large scale in the United

00:36:20.978 --> 00:36:21.445
States but believe in us

00:36:21.512 --> 00:36:22.647
actually very heavily funded as

00:36:22.713 --> 00:36:24.482
well lot of people don't

00:36:24.549 --> 00:36:26.784
realize this there's risen

00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:28.753
tire- research reports

00:36:28.819 --> 00:36:30.922
statistics and I knew I to have

00:36:30.988 --> 00:36:32.790
time for citing bring them but

00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:34.625
if you go online and hate crime

00:36:34.692 --> 00:36:35.259
funding against Muslims there's

00:36:35.326 --> 00:36:36.727
an entire report out there

00:36:36.794 --> 00:36:38.729
where this entire the

00:36:38.796 --> 00:36:40.831
Islamophobia industry is

00:36:40.898 --> 00:36:42.600
heavily funded by people living

00:36:42.667 --> 00:36:44.468
right here. In the United

00:36:44.535 --> 00:36:46.904
States of America- there was a

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:48.639
report released last week by

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:49.240
care and I saw some in here a

00:36:49.307 --> 00:36:51.008
little while ago from care of

00:36:51.075 --> 00:36:52.777
40% of Muslim students in

00:36:52.843 --> 00:36:54.712
California report being bullied

00:36:54.779 --> 00:36:56.681
because of their faith more

00:36:56.747 --> 00:36:58.382
than twice the national average

00:36:58.449 --> 00:37:00.585
for bullying in schools for all

00:37:00.651 --> 00:37:02.887
students. Which is why many

00:37:02.954 --> 00:37:03.454
Muslim families and I don't

00:37:03.521 --> 00:37:04.889
think it's fair but many Muslim

00:37:04.956 --> 00:37:06.991
families are choosing to

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:08.793
homeschool their children so

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:10.561
their children don't have to

00:37:10.628 --> 00:37:13.097
face a lot of this and it's not

00:37:13.164 --> 00:37:14.665
fair to the children- I'm I'm

00:37:14.732 --> 00:37:17.301
gonna close I'm gonna close

00:37:17.368 --> 00:37:17.935
with one quote from Henry David

00:37:18.002 --> 00:37:20.905
Thoreau- he said it is never

00:37:20.972 --> 00:37:25.242
too late to give up your-

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:26.777
business. Thank you very much.

00:37:26.844 --> 00:37:32.950
Thank you. Among was his cells

00:37:33.017 --> 00:37:34.652
of the lawmaker association and

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:36.921
actually have a die in fishers

00:37:36.988 --> 00:37:38.789
who's a director of Jewish

00:37:38.856 --> 00:37:39.423
community relations council of

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:42.526
Silicon Valley I am taking a

00:37:42.593 --> 00:37:43.127
thank you assemblymember for

00:37:43.194 --> 00:37:45.062
including me too and I think it

00:37:45.129 --> 00:37:46.998
says something that all the

00:37:47.064 --> 00:37:48.866
folks sitting here on know each

00:37:48.933 --> 00:37:50.768
other and have a long history

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:54.872
of encouraging comparison in

00:37:54.939 --> 00:37:58.909
our community. Of. So money

00:37:58.976 --> 00:38:01.012
first thought and Piney this

00:38:01.078 --> 00:38:01.479
request to talk about

00:38:01.545 --> 00:38:02.013
compassion in the Jewish

00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:02.880
community. Led me to revisit

00:38:02.947 --> 00:38:07.018
the vigil for solidarity

00:38:07.084 --> 00:38:07.618
against hate that we held in

00:38:07.685 --> 00:38:10.655
front of St as a city hall.

00:38:10.721 --> 00:38:12.757
Almost a year ago a and that

00:38:12.823 --> 00:38:14.659
was in response to the shooting

00:38:14.725 --> 00:38:15.326
of eleven people at the tree of

00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:16.761
life synagogue in Pittsburgh.

00:38:16.827 --> 00:38:20.598
And that image of so many

00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:22.967
diverse faiths represented and

00:38:23.034 --> 00:38:25.102
government. Everyone standing

00:38:25.169 --> 00:38:28.706
in solidarity in mourning. And

00:38:28.773 --> 00:38:30.508
in saying we are better than

00:38:30.574 --> 00:38:32.743
that together was a very

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:34.545
profound expression of

00:38:34.612 --> 00:38:36.781
compassion- and the ease some

00:38:36.847 --> 00:38:38.616
of you may have seen aye sixty

00:38:38.683 --> 00:38:39.216
minutes last Sunday for the

00:38:39.283 --> 00:38:42.720
anniversary of this event there

00:38:42.787 --> 00:38:43.320
was a piece on sixty minutes

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:46.524
and- the- we're showing them a

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:48.659
service at a synagogue. Where

00:38:48.726 --> 00:38:50.728
any mom said just tell us where

00:38:50.795 --> 00:38:52.430
you need us to be what do you

00:38:52.496 --> 00:38:54.865
need us to do what do you need

00:38:54.932 --> 00:38:56.801
so that you feel safe. Rate and

00:38:56.867 --> 00:38:59.070
to me that's what this is about

00:38:59.136 --> 00:39:02.606
right this is a an expression

00:39:02.673 --> 00:39:05.042
of compassion is what what is

00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:06.944
it take for kindness to be

00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:09.046
expressed to affect someone

00:39:09.113 --> 00:39:12.817
else's life. Eight and I think

00:39:12.883 --> 00:39:14.752
this is what religion is about

00:39:14.819 --> 00:39:15.386
trying to I don't think it's so

00:39:15.453 --> 00:39:16.987
much about believe I think it's

00:39:17.054 --> 00:39:18.789
about. Behaving in a

00:39:18.856 --> 00:39:22.827
compassionate way- it's about

00:39:22.893 --> 00:39:26.430
empathy and concern and justice

00:39:26.497 --> 00:39:26.997
tolerance in fairness and

00:39:27.064 --> 00:39:28.933
respect rate so even though

00:39:28.999 --> 00:39:30.935
that the Jewish code of ethics

00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:32.737
is based on a very well known

00:39:32.803 --> 00:39:34.538
commandment love your neighbor

00:39:34.605 --> 00:39:35.106
as yourself it's really not

00:39:35.172 --> 00:39:37.074
about a motion rate it's a

00:39:37.141 --> 00:39:42.646
commandment that's about.

00:39:42.713 --> 00:39:43.147
Hannibal behavior in our

00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:48.853
everyday lives. SO we have

00:39:48.919 --> 00:39:49.453
individual acts of compassion

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.554
and these can combine into

00:39:50.621 --> 00:39:51.055
communal compassionate-

00:39:51.122 --> 00:39:52.823
accident in Jewish tradition.

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:53.491
Is considered important that we

00:39:53.557 --> 00:39:57.094
be buried. Of at least in part

00:39:57.161 --> 00:39:58.796
by our friends and family not

00:39:58.863 --> 00:40:00.598
just by strangers right so we

00:40:00.664 --> 00:40:02.767
have this tradition where you

00:40:02.833 --> 00:40:04.835
actually. Difficult pick up a

00:40:04.902 --> 00:40:06.804
shovel and participate in the

00:40:06.871 --> 00:40:08.939
burial rate. He did the same

00:40:09.006 --> 00:40:09.540
rate in the Muslim tradition

00:40:09.607 --> 00:40:12.710
nay on and it's an ultimate act

00:40:12.777 --> 00:40:14.678
of compassion because the

00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:15.279
disease person can't repay the

00:40:15.346 --> 00:40:18.716
effort to you right. On

00:40:18.783 --> 00:40:20.785
providing healthcare is another

00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:21.318
area that I thought about

00:40:21.385 --> 00:40:22.953
because it's very deeply can

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.922
connected to compassion in in

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:25.456
Jewish tradition in many

00:40:25.523 --> 00:40:28.459
traditions. My synagogue holds

00:40:28.526 --> 00:40:30.995
a on. An annual health fair

00:40:31.061 --> 00:40:33.464
that's usually at eastside

00:40:33.531 --> 00:40:34.098
church every year where dozens

00:40:34.165 --> 00:40:36.801
of doctors and nurses come and

00:40:36.867 --> 00:40:37.301
provide free exams are

00:40:37.368 --> 00:40:39.136
procedures- collaboration with

00:40:39.203 --> 00:40:40.571
other health care providers

00:40:40.638 --> 00:40:42.573
from other faith communities.

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:43.240
And another thing that came to

00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:44.775
my mind was about a year ago I

00:40:44.842 --> 00:40:47.044
visited at a hospital in Israel

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:48.879
in northern Israel where I

00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:51.448
spoke with three Syrian man who

00:40:51.515 --> 00:40:52.850
were there getting treatment on

00:40:52.917 --> 00:40:54.952
the day had been injured in and

00:40:55.019 --> 00:40:56.954
the fighting. In Syria they had

00:40:57.021 --> 00:41:00.758
come to the border on to come

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:01.425
to the Israeli hospital so that

00:41:01.492 --> 00:41:05.029
was an act of compassion it had

00:41:05.095 --> 00:41:05.596
nothing to do with anything

00:41:05.663 --> 00:41:08.899
else right. Thinking about the

00:41:08.966 --> 00:41:11.068
on. Recent efforts by the

00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:12.570
department of homeland security

00:41:12.636 --> 00:41:14.705
to change the- the meaning and

00:41:14.772 --> 00:41:16.740
effective public charge. People

00:41:16.807 --> 00:41:17.374
than filing that rate nay the

00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:19.276
which can that affect people's

00:41:19.343 --> 00:41:20.911
ability to be admitted as

00:41:20.978 --> 00:41:23.047
immigrants United States- which

00:41:23.113 --> 00:41:24.748
fortunately has been

00:41:24.815 --> 00:41:26.617
temporarily stopped by a

00:41:26.684 --> 00:41:27.251
preliminary injunction but- I

00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:29.086
thought about it a different

00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:30.654
compassionate approach to

00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:32.656
helping immigrants- that my

00:41:32.723 --> 00:41:34.925
community- had which was-

00:41:34.992 --> 00:41:36.927
keeper free loan. Rate about a

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:37.528
hundred years ago in Jewish

00:41:37.595 --> 00:41:40.497
people were immigrating a

00:41:40.564 --> 00:41:41.098
larger numbers to this country

00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:44.768
on. He were free loan was

00:41:44.835 --> 00:41:47.137
created so with that and people

00:41:47.204 --> 00:41:48.772
could have a an interest free

00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:50.641
loan to start a business or

00:41:50.708 --> 00:41:52.776
adopt children or pay for

00:41:52.843 --> 00:41:54.879
health care- you know get job

00:41:54.945 --> 00:41:57.047
training them any kind of

00:41:57.114 --> 00:41:58.582
emergency. And it was basically

00:41:58.649 --> 00:42:00.784
advertises a alone for those

00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:02.486
who need a hand up not a hand

00:42:02.553 --> 00:42:04.755
out a that was the purpose and

00:42:04.822 --> 00:42:06.790
my husband's grandparents- got

00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:07.324
an interest free loan and

00:42:07.391 --> 00:42:08.993
started a little a hardware

00:42:09.059 --> 00:42:10.828
store in the Fillmore district

00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:12.830
in San Francisco. And now we

00:42:12.897 --> 00:42:13.430
have three generations of our

00:42:13.497 --> 00:42:16.667
family that have continued to

00:42:16.734 --> 00:42:18.702
thrive because of that act of

00:42:18.769 --> 00:42:20.971
compassion. On something that's

00:42:21.038 --> 00:42:21.605
it was an important example for

00:42:21.672 --> 00:42:25.209
me. Some people we think that

00:42:25.276 --> 00:42:25.776
legislating compassion is

00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:27.144
perhaps it sounds like we're

00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:28.712
trying to do is impossible but

00:42:28.779 --> 00:42:29.313
even if I just look at my own

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:32.650
Jewish tradition it's clear.

00:42:32.716 --> 00:42:34.551
That when we talk about kind is

00:42:34.618 --> 00:42:36.620
give me live has said in Hebrew

00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:38.656
it's a behavior that we say

00:42:38.722 --> 00:42:39.223
everyone should engage in

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:40.991
whether you feel motivated to

00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:42.793
do it or not Hey that's good or

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.828
not. The point ray- and in the

00:42:44.895 --> 00:42:46.830
Hebrew Bible we- are we've

00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:48.866
known to repeat thirty six

00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:50.868
times some form of Dona press

00:42:50.935 --> 00:42:52.870
the stranger rate. And the

00:42:52.937 --> 00:42:54.505
rabbi say it's repeated because

00:42:54.571 --> 00:42:56.540
it's really hard rate it's a

00:42:56.607 --> 00:42:57.141
goal for us to treat people

00:42:57.207 --> 00:42:58.742
that are different from

00:42:58.809 --> 00:43:00.678
ourselves with compassion but

00:43:00.744 --> 00:43:01.245
we need the reminder and I

00:43:01.312 --> 00:43:04.615
think. This assembly resolution

00:43:04.682 --> 00:43:05.149
on compassion is another

00:43:05.215 --> 00:43:08.686
necessary reminder rate let's

00:43:08.752 --> 00:43:10.688
let's just say this a lot and

00:43:10.754 --> 00:43:12.856
often because we clearly in a

00:43:12.923 --> 00:43:16.527
time when we need this reminder.

00:43:16.593 --> 00:43:18.796
So where it work discussing

00:43:18.862 --> 00:43:19.430
this compassion partly because

00:43:19.496 --> 00:43:20.831
of Kern Armstrong's wish in two

00:43:20.898 --> 00:43:21.465
thousand eight rate that. That

00:43:21.532 --> 00:43:23.133
there's a charter for

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.969
compassion around the same time

00:43:25.035 --> 00:43:26.837
Jeremy Rifkin read a book.

00:43:26.904 --> 00:43:28.739
Titled the empathic

00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:30.941
civilization and he wrote that

00:43:31.008 --> 00:43:32.643
were software to experience

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.778
others feelings. Through mirror

00:43:34.845 --> 00:43:36.814
neurons in our brains Hey we

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.582
have empathy because we

00:43:38.649 --> 00:43:40.517
understand our own frailties

00:43:40.584 --> 00:43:42.619
and we feel solidarity with

00:43:42.686 --> 00:43:43.253
other people's vulnerability.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.089
And the last ten years is in a

00:43:45.155 --> 00:43:46.991
lot of research on the

00:43:47.057 --> 00:43:48.692
assumptions of our human

00:43:48.759 --> 00:43:51.028
nature. Rate on it shows that

00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:52.629
we're not software to be

00:43:52.696 --> 00:43:55.032
utilitarian and self interested

00:43:55.099 --> 00:43:56.967
in materialistic rate. That

00:43:57.034 --> 00:43:58.802
sociability an attachment.

00:43:58.869 --> 00:44:02.606
Affection and empathy our our

00:44:02.673 --> 00:44:04.541
key wiring so our government

00:44:04.608 --> 00:44:05.075
and our families and our

00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:06.844
businesses and our education.

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:08.779
They need to be in a re

00:44:08.846 --> 00:44:14.551
oriented to it to be adapted.

00:44:14.618 --> 00:44:15.085
To our focus center human

00:44:15.152 --> 00:44:18.622
capacity for compassion. Our

00:44:18.689 --> 00:44:19.056
cell phones in our

00:44:19.123 --> 00:44:20.791
communication tools are often

00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:21.392
considered to be like our big

00:44:21.458 --> 00:44:23.060
down fall in our ability to be

00:44:23.127 --> 00:44:24.695
compassionate but they also

00:44:24.762 --> 00:44:26.597
function to bring more diverse

00:44:26.663 --> 00:44:28.832
people together so in Jeremy

00:44:28.899 --> 00:44:29.400
Rifkin's but he also talks

00:44:29.466 --> 00:44:31.035
about what brought people into

00:44:31.101 --> 00:44:32.870
empathic feelings for each

00:44:32.936 --> 00:44:34.738
other. On and how that's

00:44:34.805 --> 00:44:36.440
changed from ancient

00:44:36.507 --> 00:44:38.776
civilizations till now so

00:44:38.842 --> 00:44:40.511
compassionate aging times was

00:44:40.577 --> 00:44:41.145
basically blood ties rate if

00:44:41.211 --> 00:44:42.780
you really related to somebody

00:44:42.846 --> 00:44:44.748
and then religious ties right

00:44:44.815 --> 00:44:46.984
all Muslims feel tight and all

00:44:47.051 --> 00:44:47.484
Jews held tight enough

00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:48.952
Christians feel tied to each

00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:50.921
other. And then we had national

00:44:50.988 --> 00:44:52.890
identity ties rate Creek French

00:44:52.956 --> 00:44:54.858
and German ties whatever rate

00:44:54.925 --> 00:44:57.161
of that but now people have the

00:44:57.227 --> 00:44:58.562
ability to empathize with

00:44:58.629 --> 00:45:00.798
others that don't live near

00:45:00.864 --> 00:45:01.432
them at all they don't. They

00:45:01.498 --> 00:45:03.267
don't. Have the same religion

00:45:03.333 --> 00:45:03.901
that don't even speak the same

00:45:03.967 --> 00:45:06.670
language right you can use

00:45:06.737 --> 00:45:07.237
Google translate and you can

00:45:07.304 --> 00:45:07.905
talk to anybody anywhere in the

00:45:07.971 --> 00:45:10.574
world. So we have individual

00:45:10.641 --> 00:45:11.241
power to communicate with each

00:45:11.308 --> 00:45:12.943
other without any kind of top

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:14.845
level controls mandating it we

00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:17.047
have like distributed

00:45:17.114 --> 00:45:18.649
compassion possibility. And

00:45:18.715 --> 00:45:20.784
really at the end of our lives

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:22.453
it's that Ana empathic

00:45:22.519 --> 00:45:24.721
connection to people which we

00:45:24.788 --> 00:45:28.992
consider. To be the most

00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:29.593
important thing we've done it

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.863
all in our time. So in light of

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:33.530
our current social ills I think

00:45:33.597 --> 00:45:34.565
this focus on compassion also

00:45:34.631 --> 00:45:35.165
needs to take. The form of

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:37.101
practicing tolerance for people

00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:39.470
who. Think differently than

00:45:39.536 --> 00:45:40.637
ourselves and particularly in

00:45:40.704 --> 00:45:42.773
California we're gonna set a

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.675
trend this is important. S.

00:45:44.741 --> 00:45:47.177
Hebrew word for tolerance is

00:45:47.244 --> 00:45:49.012
sold là newt. It derives from

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:52.583
the words several which means.

00:45:52.649 --> 00:45:54.685
To suffer so in other words we

00:45:54.751 --> 00:45:55.319
have to injure a certain amount

00:45:55.385 --> 00:45:58.622
of discomfort. To tolerate

00:45:58.689 --> 00:46:00.657
people with different views ray

00:46:00.724 --> 00:46:01.291
and Kern Armstrong also said

00:46:01.358 --> 00:46:02.759
that a compassionate city one

00:46:02.826 --> 00:46:05.095
of the things about it is it

00:46:05.162 --> 00:46:06.663
needs to be an- uncomfortable.

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:08.866
City rate SB we just need to

00:46:08.932 --> 00:46:09.433
accept that. Tolerance isn't

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:12.603
isn't just about acting kindly

00:46:12.669 --> 00:46:14.705
to people that we believe are a

00:46:14.771 --> 00:46:15.272
rung. It's also recognizing

00:46:15.339 --> 00:46:16.840
that there might be some truth.

00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:19.042
In positions that we disagree

00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:20.677
with rate the Talmud teaches

00:46:20.744 --> 00:46:21.211
that intellectual growth

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:23.413
depends on exposing yourself to

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:26.683
a variety of viewpoints a we

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:27.251
need to. To know about other

00:46:27.317 --> 00:46:29.019
views with which we possibly do

00:46:29.086 --> 00:46:30.854
we otherwise we have an

00:46:30.921 --> 00:46:31.455
incomplete understanding. But

00:46:31.522 --> 00:46:34.758
there's one. Thing that Jewish

00:46:34.825 --> 00:46:38.896
tradition teaches. As where in

00:46:38.962 --> 00:46:42.766
tolerance is a virtue. Which is

00:46:42.833 --> 00:46:43.433
in opposition to someone who if

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.868
they gain power would deny

00:46:44.935 --> 00:46:45.435
freedom to those with which

00:46:45.502 --> 00:46:46.503
they disagree. So we should

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:48.639
stand strongly against anyone

00:46:48.705 --> 00:46:50.607
using democracies tolerance for

00:46:50.674 --> 00:46:52.843
an effort to overthrow it so I

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:54.878
think that in our current

00:46:54.945 --> 00:46:55.412
situation this call for

00:46:55.479 --> 00:46:56.813
compassion. Should be joined

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.984
together with a call to sustain

00:47:01.051 --> 00:47:03.420
our democracy thanks. Thank you

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:05.289
thank you Diane I think you you

00:47:05.355 --> 00:47:07.057
had the head of the nail right

00:47:07.124 --> 00:47:08.725
beard see you know this

00:47:08.792 --> 00:47:10.994
compassionate. A resolution is

00:47:11.061 --> 00:47:14.831
really only serve as a reminder

00:47:14.898 --> 00:47:16.633
you know we need to the

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:20.771
committee involvement we need

00:47:20.837 --> 00:47:21.405
to religious leaders seem often

00:47:21.471 --> 00:47:22.639
through the to move to our

00:47:22.706 --> 00:47:25.175
state and the more

00:47:25.242 --> 00:47:25.776
compassionate stay so it was

00:47:25.842 --> 00:47:27.544
you really truly. A reminder

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:30.881
I'll also wanna thank you for

00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:32.583
your- your work on the roof G.

00:47:32.649 --> 00:47:35.018
settlement. I remember was Mike

00:47:35.085 --> 00:47:38.922
my district staff was one one

00:47:38.989 --> 00:47:39.489
day want to our office and

00:47:39.556 --> 00:47:42.759
stuff a lot of back pack will

00:47:42.826 --> 00:47:44.695
going back to school so thank

00:47:44.761 --> 00:47:46.597
you very much for reaching out

00:47:46.663 --> 00:47:52.703
to the community. And actually.

00:47:52.769 --> 00:47:56.673
Have a father Joe home prodigal.

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:58.709
Father John is from a Catholic

00:47:58.775 --> 00:48:00.544
charities of Santa Clara county.

00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:01.111
Okay Sir thank you very much

00:48:01.178 --> 00:48:02.479
for inviting me to speak to

00:48:02.546 --> 00:48:03.080
this issue Margaret Mead was

00:48:03.146 --> 00:48:05.115
asked. What was the signed the

00:48:05.182 --> 00:48:09.019
first sign of civilization and

00:48:09.086 --> 00:48:10.621
she responded the heel femur

00:48:10.687 --> 00:48:11.255
he'll femur bone of the strong

00:48:11.321 --> 00:48:13.023
his bones in the body but once

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.225
is broken it's very very

00:48:15.292 --> 00:48:15.792
difficult and it makes it

00:48:15.859 --> 00:48:18.862
income it it- percent Mendoza

00:48:18.929 --> 00:48:20.664
prison unable to defend him or

00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:22.633
herself they will need other

00:48:22.699 --> 00:48:23.267
people the to care for them so

00:48:23.333 --> 00:48:24.835
the early sign of a

00:48:24.901 --> 00:48:27.337
civilization was actually

00:48:27.404 --> 00:48:28.772
finding. A healed femur bone

00:48:28.839 --> 00:48:30.807
because it presumes that the

00:48:30.874 --> 00:48:32.743
people that were- with this

00:48:32.809 --> 00:48:35.045
particular group of early

00:48:35.112 --> 00:48:36.947
humanoids are bandied around

00:48:37.014 --> 00:48:39.016
gathered around this individual

00:48:39.082 --> 00:48:40.784
and care for the person just

00:48:40.851 --> 00:48:42.919
put themselves in front of

00:48:42.986 --> 00:48:44.821
danger to heal this person and

00:48:44.888 --> 00:48:46.890
that fact that was healed that

00:48:46.957 --> 00:48:47.524
person was was taking care for

00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:50.627
a long time so that idea. Of

00:48:50.694 --> 00:48:51.261
compassion is hard wired into

00:48:51.328 --> 00:48:54.765
our species but it's also broke

00:48:54.831 --> 00:48:56.967
in our by a deliberate design

00:48:57.034 --> 00:48:59.169
decision to go against our

00:48:59.236 --> 00:49:00.771
human nature what we see

00:49:00.837 --> 00:49:03.173
happening right now. Hate

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.675
crimes increasing gets Latinos

00:49:04.741 --> 00:49:06.977
are over 50% and I think that

00:49:07.044 --> 00:49:07.611
you heard the mom to hear who'd

00:49:07.678 --> 00:49:09.746
excused of for purposes a few

00:49:09.813 --> 00:49:10.914
minutes- talked about the

00:49:10.981 --> 00:49:12.849
increase in in hate crimes

00:49:12.916 --> 00:49:15.152
against Muslims in the Jewish

00:49:15.218 --> 00:49:16.753
to hate crimes increase 60% in

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.889
these- in the past two years of

00:49:18.955 --> 00:49:19.423
the hate crime is not an

00:49:19.489 --> 00:49:22.893
accident that is happening but

00:49:22.959 --> 00:49:23.460
it's to the direct language

00:49:23.527 --> 00:49:24.795
coming from the very top. So we

00:49:24.861 --> 00:49:27.164
understand that I was just in

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.698
el Paso with bishop mark

00:49:27.764 --> 00:49:28.965
science who signed a pastoral

00:49:29.032 --> 00:49:31.001
letter linking and very clearly

00:49:31.068 --> 00:49:34.738
showing the linkage between

00:49:34.805 --> 00:49:36.907
hate language racism and border

00:49:36.973 --> 00:49:39.042
policies and how that affects

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.676
people in el Paso he's a bishop

00:49:39.743 --> 00:49:42.612
in el Paso he's he watched and

00:49:42.679 --> 00:49:44.648
was walking with the people the

00:49:44.715 --> 00:49:45.282
twenty three people that were

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:46.950
murdered- because of their race

00:49:47.017 --> 00:49:48.919
and when we speak to people in

00:49:48.985 --> 00:49:51.121
our community have gone to do

00:49:51.188 --> 00:49:52.923
focus groups have gone to my

00:49:52.989 --> 00:49:54.558
own membership and- different

00:49:54.624 --> 00:49:58.929
groups around the county.

00:49:58.995 --> 00:49:59.496
Income in this district that

00:49:59.563 --> 00:50:00.130
people are saying that they now

00:50:00.197 --> 00:50:05.068
for. Feel they are hunted

00:50:05.135 --> 00:50:07.137
because of the color of their

00:50:07.204 --> 00:50:07.804
skin and his identifies Latinos.

00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:09.973
This is coming on the heels

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:10.474
what law in the Latino

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:11.007
community in the Catholic

00:50:11.074 --> 00:50:11.641
outlet here community they see

00:50:11.708 --> 00:50:12.275
these these ideas of a public

00:50:12.342 --> 00:50:13.243
charge they see these are the

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:14.945
separation of our family the

00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:15.545
border. Over the phone into

00:50:15.612 --> 00:50:16.780
cages are at the their

00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:20.751
deliberately top being targeted

00:50:20.817 --> 00:50:21.351
by these policies and by the

00:50:21.418 --> 00:50:25.021
language- and children are very

00:50:25.088 --> 00:50:28.658
very aware of what's happening.

00:50:28.725 --> 00:50:29.259
I to them and because of that

00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:31.061
we want to I just want to say

00:50:31.128 --> 00:50:31.628
this very clearly because I

00:50:31.695 --> 00:50:32.996
know speaking as a is there a

00:50:33.063 --> 00:50:34.965
question in all of this and I.

00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:35.499
Come out of the Catholic

00:50:35.565 --> 00:50:36.767
tradition but- since I was

00:50:36.833 --> 00:50:39.035
Reyes Buddhist and my dad was a

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:40.704
Protestant and I became

00:50:40.771 --> 00:50:43.039
Catholic- I think I can speak

00:50:43.106 --> 00:50:44.574
on a three ecumenical

00:50:44.641 --> 00:50:45.208
experience. Level experience a

00:50:45.275 --> 00:50:48.912
level- and hang out with a lot

00:50:48.979 --> 00:50:49.546
of my friends are Jewish that

00:50:49.613 --> 00:50:50.781
are going to Buddhist things

00:50:50.847 --> 00:50:52.816
and other Sufi things so I

00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:54.718
having a lot of these very

00:50:54.785 --> 00:50:56.486
strange friends. But the idea

00:50:56.553 --> 00:50:57.053
what I do one is. So strange

00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:02.826
you know but I think.

00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:03.393
Substituting but with these

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:03.994
guys up here but I think where

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:06.997
the people are. The whole going

00:51:07.063 --> 00:51:07.597
on. But I think that what you

00:51:07.664 --> 00:51:08.532
we is people of faith. I did

00:51:08.598 --> 00:51:09.166
exception that. Leadership of

00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:11.201
at the very highest levels are

00:51:11.268 --> 00:51:12.903
co opting religious language.

00:51:12.969 --> 00:51:14.905
As a way to justify hatred. And

00:51:14.971 --> 00:51:16.940
then activity even with those

00:51:17.007 --> 00:51:19.142
who are Christian. That we know

00:51:19.209 --> 00:51:21.278
that within in their Christian

00:51:21.344 --> 00:51:22.946
ranks. There are a number of

00:51:23.013 --> 00:51:24.915
people that agree with these

00:51:24.981 --> 00:51:26.917
policies. That see nothing

00:51:26.983 --> 00:51:27.584
wrong with. Putting children in

00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:29.219
cages they see nothing wrong

00:51:29.286 --> 00:51:30.954
with. A taking away health

00:51:31.021 --> 00:51:32.989
care. Of from families in need.

00:51:33.056 --> 00:51:34.991
And they see nothing wrong with

00:51:35.058 --> 00:51:36.726
ignoring the Fourteenth

00:51:36.793 --> 00:51:37.327
Amendment which gives every.

00:51:37.394 --> 00:51:38.929
Person living in the United

00:51:38.995 --> 00:51:40.764
States and any of its

00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:41.298
territories. The same due

00:51:41.364 --> 00:51:43.066
process and everybody else.

00:51:43.133 --> 00:51:45.035
That we they they forget that

00:51:45.101 --> 00:51:46.603
there's a constitutional

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:48.772
reality. And they're willing to

00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:49.406
overlook that and overlook all

00:51:49.473 --> 00:51:51.675
the- evo all these kinds of

00:51:51.741 --> 00:51:52.943
things and so I called my

00:51:53.009 --> 00:51:54.811
Christian brothers and sisters.

00:51:54.878 --> 00:51:55.412
Who may be in this room but

00:51:55.479 --> 00:51:56.613
certainly to let you. Know

00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:02.752
that- that we came out of. You

00:52:02.819 --> 00:52:04.888
out of it out of a Jewish

00:52:04.955 --> 00:52:05.388
context. And so we have

00:52:05.455 --> 00:52:08.692
inherited a rich tradition of

00:52:08.758 --> 00:52:10.827
what Dianne just finished

00:52:10.894 --> 00:52:11.461
speaking about of course said

00:52:11.528 --> 00:52:12.996
of loving kindness. Of loving

00:52:13.063 --> 00:52:14.965
mercy of living that out in

00:52:15.031 --> 00:52:17.067
faith we can't do that so out

00:52:17.133 --> 00:52:18.668
of Christian Christian

00:52:18.735 --> 00:52:21.404
scriptures have to be

00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:22.005
understood in the context of

00:52:22.072 --> 00:52:23.139
what is it mean. To reflect on

00:52:23.206 --> 00:52:25.075
the Torah on the law of god

00:52:25.141 --> 00:52:27.611
love more. Is revealed to Moses

00:52:27.677 --> 00:52:29.112
and that we and all of our

00:52:29.179 --> 00:52:31.014
teachings come out of the idea

00:52:31.081 --> 00:52:33.016
that. That in are there is no

00:52:33.083 --> 00:52:34.784
distinction of male female

00:52:34.851 --> 00:52:37.020
slave or free that we are all

00:52:37.087 --> 00:52:38.622
one it doesn't make that

00:52:38.688 --> 00:52:39.256
difference so that that makes

00:52:39.322 --> 00:52:41.057
it very clear that this

00:52:41.124 --> 00:52:42.826
question of. Separate bathrooms

00:52:42.893 --> 00:52:44.995
is ninety and you can't use

00:52:45.061 --> 00:52:46.696
that is a it from a Christian

00:52:46.763 --> 00:52:47.264
perspective I think you can

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:50.867
think you are but you clearly

00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:51.434
when you look at scripture.

00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:52.836
Once and such strong ground the

00:52:52.903 --> 00:52:55.138
other ideas at that in if even

00:52:55.205 --> 00:52:56.506
within Christian scripture

00:52:56.573 --> 00:52:58.708
speaks of salvation is being.

00:52:58.775 --> 00:52:59.309
Everyone gathered around the

00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:01.444
one throne of god and the lamb

00:53:01.511 --> 00:53:01.978
of god they identified as

00:53:02.045 --> 00:53:04.614
Christ Jesus. That at around

00:53:04.681 --> 00:53:06.917
that lamb of god in this kind

00:53:06.983 --> 00:53:09.052
of idea this. Powerful imagery

00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:11.021
it is all nations gather

00:53:11.087 --> 00:53:12.856
regardless of race tried nation

00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:14.991
and people that they're all

00:53:15.058 --> 00:53:15.659
gather together and seeing each

00:53:15.725 --> 00:53:18.828
other as one. Again so with in

00:53:18.895 --> 00:53:19.429
the Christian tradition there

00:53:19.496 --> 00:53:22.632
is. A sense of racial equality

00:53:22.699 --> 00:53:24.935
there is no sense of separation

00:53:25.001 --> 00:53:26.903
superiority and lastly- the

00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:28.872
historically asistir lanes now

00:53:28.939 --> 00:53:31.107
speaking of the character

00:53:31.174 --> 00:53:31.741
historical tradition. We have

00:53:31.808 --> 00:53:32.842
always been a church of

00:53:32.909 --> 00:53:33.443
immigrants so we came over as

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:36.680
immigrants ourselves- most of

00:53:36.746 --> 00:53:37.347
the of the priest of the dice

00:53:37.414 --> 00:53:39.215
is a San Jose or immigrants

00:53:39.282 --> 00:53:41.017
very few were actually native

00:53:41.084 --> 00:53:42.752
born the from. India the from

00:53:42.819 --> 00:53:44.654
different countries in Africa

00:53:44.721 --> 00:53:45.121
they're from different

00:53:45.188 --> 00:53:46.690
countries and Spanish speaking

00:53:46.756 --> 00:53:48.959
America's- Europe and all

00:53:49.025 --> 00:53:54.631
throughout Asia. So we is a

00:53:54.698 --> 00:54:02.472
Catholic Church in this diocese.

00:54:02.539 --> 00:54:04.708
You know are not just video of

00:54:04.774 --> 00:54:05.275
a church of immigrants your

00:54:05.342 --> 00:54:06.810
church that is solidly walking

00:54:06.876 --> 00:54:07.444
with him in immigrants. In it

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:08.945
is specifically of those were

00:54:09.012 --> 00:54:09.579
the most broken most vulnerable

00:54:09.646 --> 00:54:10.847
to these policies. And there's

00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:12.682
a language that has victimized-

00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:13.350
our people. Are lastly we talk

00:54:13.416 --> 00:54:15.318
about the idea of some of the

00:54:15.385 --> 00:54:15.952
as a victim. Of violence then

00:54:16.019 --> 00:54:16.987
that that you know we used to

00:54:17.053 --> 00:54:17.621
think there's only two choices

00:54:17.687 --> 00:54:18.888
when you're silent victim you

00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:20.757
just take it. Your strong you

00:54:20.824 --> 00:54:21.324
move on that's my mother's

00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:22.993
Japanese tradition that you

00:54:23.059 --> 00:54:24.961
know you just. All the things

00:54:25.028 --> 00:54:26.730
that happened her folks the her

00:54:26.796 --> 00:54:28.898
people I'm that you just. Yo

00:54:28.965 --> 00:54:30.934
you just move ahead. And you

00:54:31.001 --> 00:54:32.702
move ahead was silent and

00:54:32.769 --> 00:54:34.671
steely determination. But not

00:54:34.738 --> 00:54:36.906
everybody how's that and once

00:54:36.973 --> 00:54:39.142
that is an option. To and the

00:54:39.209 --> 00:54:41.011
other thing that we don't want

00:54:41.077 --> 00:54:42.979
the people have another option

00:54:43.046 --> 00:54:43.546
they think is just being an

00:54:43.613 --> 00:54:45.015
object of someone else's

00:54:45.081 --> 00:54:45.448
charity well at the

00:54:45.515 --> 00:54:46.983
legislators. Make a rule for us

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:49.019
will make will have a grant

00:54:49.085 --> 00:54:51.121
finder give us some money will

00:54:51.187 --> 00:54:52.555
have some teacher some other

00:54:52.622 --> 00:54:54.758
institution speak for us. And

00:54:54.824 --> 00:54:57.060
that's wrong. Because people

00:54:57.127 --> 00:54:58.628
are to speak for themselves.

00:54:58.695 --> 00:55:00.697
And so that the job of the

00:55:00.764 --> 00:55:01.197
religious community is

00:55:01.264 --> 00:55:02.966
certainly in my experience. Is

00:55:03.033 --> 00:55:04.734
that we need to create that

00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:06.870
space for those who are

00:55:06.936 --> 00:55:07.470
directly affected those were

00:55:07.537 --> 00:55:10.907
directly. Beaten by these kinds

00:55:10.974 --> 00:55:12.742
of policies this kind of

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:14.511
language and physically

00:55:14.577 --> 00:55:16.680
attacked because of their race

00:55:16.746 --> 00:55:17.247
their gender identity this

00:55:17.313 --> 00:55:18.848
sexual orientation or their

00:55:18.915 --> 00:55:20.750
religious affiliation because-

00:55:20.817 --> 00:55:23.086
these are the people that need

00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:25.088
to be at the table to speak and

00:55:25.155 --> 00:55:26.756
views the people that need to

00:55:26.823 --> 00:55:27.390
be the cages. Tables that make

00:55:27.457 --> 00:55:29.025
those decisions about what does

00:55:29.092 --> 00:55:30.727
it mean to be compassionate.

00:55:30.794 --> 00:55:32.996
Because IT. You can pass as

00:55:33.063 --> 00:55:35.098
white I'm not white but I can

00:55:35.165 --> 00:55:36.866
pass a sense all day get you

00:55:36.933 --> 00:55:42.605
know sure. But you know what.

00:55:42.672 --> 00:55:50.613
Not everybody that can pass by.

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:51.181
Not everybody can enjoy the

00:55:51.247 --> 00:55:51.848
certain privileges. And so that

00:55:51.915 --> 00:55:53.116
our belief at least in for our

00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:53.750
Calvet tradition is that people

00:55:53.817 --> 00:55:54.317
we need to create that space

00:55:54.384 --> 00:55:54.884
for people to speak directly

00:55:54.951 --> 00:55:55.485
from their experience we but

00:55:55.552 --> 00:55:56.619
we- have a- verse that we- we-

00:55:56.686 --> 00:55:58.588
we understand is. God hears our

00:55:58.655 --> 00:55:59.155
cries the poor some thirty

00:55:59.222 --> 00:56:00.957
four. Or thirty three diverse

00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:01.591
aye account by the to that this

00:56:01.658 --> 00:56:02.559
idea is that. You god is

00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:04.661
hearing the cries the poor and

00:56:04.728 --> 00:56:05.328
therefore it is incumbent upon

00:56:05.395 --> 00:56:07.063
those who call themselves

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:08.832
allegiance to god or people of

00:56:08.898 --> 00:56:10.867
god. They must also here these

00:56:10.934 --> 00:56:13.002
very same crises. They can't go

00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:16.706
empty into the desert. So

00:56:16.773 --> 00:56:17.307
creating space means this and

00:56:17.373 --> 00:56:18.775
it's a simple theology- that we

00:56:18.842 --> 00:56:20.777
are getting from- that we

00:56:20.844 --> 00:56:22.679
receive is Catholics. From a

00:56:22.746 --> 00:56:25.315
pope Francis who leads us by

00:56:25.381 --> 00:56:28.918
example and by. By by

00:56:28.985 --> 00:56:33.056
encouraging. Not just Catholics

00:56:33.123 --> 00:56:33.690
but people of all good will is

00:56:33.757 --> 00:56:35.091
that creating space means you

00:56:35.158 --> 00:56:35.692
quite in if you increase the

00:56:35.759 --> 00:56:36.826
space for listening. Encuentro

00:56:36.893 --> 00:56:38.928
and that is really that the

00:56:38.995 --> 00:56:41.064
mutually. Transformative

00:56:41.131 --> 00:56:42.832
experience of listening to

00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:45.201
another person creating that

00:56:45.268 --> 00:56:47.003
space for that. That story that

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:49.005
narrative to be told and that

00:56:49.072 --> 00:56:51.040
means that we have to step

00:56:51.107 --> 00:56:52.876
back. And recover the art of

00:56:52.942 --> 00:56:55.011
listening and stop the dialogue

00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:58.815
in. In in in in tweets are in

00:56:58.882 --> 00:57:01.618
income will silly remarks. My

00:57:01.684 --> 00:57:04.654
roommate making finger gestures

00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:05.221
from the earth to the moon

00:57:05.288 --> 00:57:06.856
whatever I mean you can't do

00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:08.958
those things without stopping

00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:11.194
and listening and creating that

00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:12.962
space. For an interpersonal.

00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:14.964
Connection to happen so our

00:57:15.031 --> 00:57:16.766
methodology at least I'm

00:57:16.833 --> 00:57:18.968
working with a group that's

00:57:19.035 --> 00:57:19.602
working on the methodology of

00:57:19.669 --> 00:57:20.670
encuentra that is mutually

00:57:20.737 --> 00:57:22.672
counter we're we listen and

00:57:22.739 --> 00:57:23.239
those who have that. Have

00:57:23.306 --> 00:57:25.008
privilege don't talk about the

00:57:25.074 --> 00:57:27.310
privilege but they simply

00:57:27.377 --> 00:57:28.711
listen. They become aware of

00:57:28.778 --> 00:57:31.114
who they are and who space they

00:57:31.181 --> 00:57:31.681
walk and we're aware of the

00:57:31.748 --> 00:57:32.916
land. On a who. You on a who we

00:57:32.982 --> 00:57:35.051
occupy we occupy the because

00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:37.053
stone's we occupy the Aloni we

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.888
occupy the met various

00:57:38.955 --> 00:57:40.657
different me walk the various

00:57:40.723 --> 00:57:42.792
different. Communities and

00:57:42.859 --> 00:57:43.459
nations that there on this land

00:57:43.526 --> 00:57:44.994
we are inherently wear that and

00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:47.030
we're connected to the planet

00:57:47.096 --> 00:57:47.664
were connected to listening and

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:50.533
so that encuentra. Is that

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:52.702
dialogue that begins in

00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:54.704
listening and humbleness of you

00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:57.106
where people are in their lives

00:57:57.173 --> 00:57:58.908
and that experience with calls

00:57:58.975 --> 00:57:59.475
is solidarity or celebrity

00:57:59.542 --> 00:58:00.944
that. That experience a

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:04.681
solidity that of solidarity

00:58:04.747 --> 00:58:05.315
weakens in us we call continues

00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:08.618
us you own. A wakening and not

00:58:08.685 --> 00:58:09.052
just awareness but a

00:58:09.118 --> 00:58:15.024
commitment. To continuing that

00:58:15.091 --> 00:58:22.866
dialogue. And so for- for from

00:58:22.932 --> 00:58:23.433
my perspective fact I think

00:58:23.499 --> 00:58:27.237
that and I. One minute. Okay

00:58:27.303 --> 00:58:28.905
thank our get sick as a priest

00:58:28.972 --> 00:58:29.539
in go on forever but I won't-

00:58:29.606 --> 00:58:30.840
but but I want to talk about

00:58:30.907 --> 00:58:31.441
the idea of solidarity because

00:58:31.507 --> 00:58:32.041
that's ultimately what we're

00:58:32.108 --> 00:58:32.575
all call to do in terms of

00:58:32.642 --> 00:58:33.109
creating compassion and

00:58:33.176 --> 00:58:33.676
solidarity is it just as a

00:58:33.743 --> 00:58:34.744
stance in your head or-

00:58:34.811 --> 00:58:35.378
ideological perspective it is

00:58:35.445 --> 00:58:36.613
actually putting our bodies.

00:58:36.679 --> 00:58:38.748
Next to other people our bodies

00:58:38.815 --> 00:58:40.817
are in solidarity not our minds

00:58:40.884 --> 00:58:43.019
on if not a theology not our

00:58:43.086 --> 00:58:43.586
ideology and it's not about

00:58:43.653 --> 00:58:46.689
**** by ya. It is about true

00:58:46.756 --> 00:58:49.025
honest commitment of walking

00:58:49.092 --> 00:58:52.662
with feeling empathizing and

00:58:52.729 --> 00:58:53.263
making it your because as well

00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:54.764
as I think that the piece in

00:58:54.831 --> 00:58:56.833
terms of faith me that's the

00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:57.500
work that we're trying to do we

00:58:57.567 --> 00:58:59.002
do that in a bunch of different

00:58:59.068 --> 00:59:01.271
kind of zip codes where we were

00:59:01.337 --> 00:59:01.905
as Catholic charities we work.

00:59:01.971 --> 00:59:04.641
With our agent we work with

00:59:04.707 --> 00:59:05.208
rather with our clients we

00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:06.910
trick train those who work with

00:59:06.976 --> 00:59:08.678
the people are case workers a

00:59:08.745 --> 00:59:10.947
case managers it is all about

00:59:11.014 --> 00:59:11.547
that listing and accompanying

00:59:11.614 --> 00:59:13.016
an individual. No matter what's

00:59:13.082 --> 00:59:16.686
happened that compassion has to

00:59:16.753 --> 00:59:18.688
flow from our humidity at that

00:59:18.755 --> 00:59:19.289
comes from the fact that we

00:59:19.355 --> 00:59:20.957
have a heel femur in our

00:59:21.024 --> 00:59:26.629
ancestor and that he'll teamer.

00:59:26.696 --> 00:59:27.163
Has to be handed down from

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:32.769
generation to generation. Thank

00:59:32.835 --> 00:59:34.837
you thank you very much. Of the

00:59:34.904 --> 00:59:35.505
John. Does want to take a- few

00:59:35.571 --> 00:59:37.073
minutes to. Go over some

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:38.942
housekeeping I can. And do will

00:59:39.008 --> 00:59:40.910
be time for public comment at

00:59:40.977 --> 00:59:43.313
the end. And for those in the

00:59:43.379 --> 00:59:45.081
audience that would like to

00:59:45.148 --> 00:59:46.716
make a public comment. Please

00:59:46.783 --> 00:59:48.818
raise your hand and one of my

00:59:48.885 --> 00:59:49.419
staff can provide you with the

00:59:49.485 --> 00:59:55.558
car. Views me. Thank you now-

00:59:55.625 --> 00:59:58.594
moving on to- Jewish shop from

00:59:58.661 --> 01:00:00.897
the- the cofounder of the chain

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:04.934
center. And all of northern

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:05.535
California by hearing in milk

01:00:05.601 --> 01:00:14.610
this. Cherish. Okay. In the

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:15.178
technology world you always

01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:18.948
have to line. Thank you again

01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:22.885
for inviting me. I I'm going to

01:00:22.952 --> 01:00:24.620
talk a little bit of our to our

01:00:24.687 --> 01:00:27.090
fate because most people who

01:00:27.156 --> 01:00:29.092
may not know all what Chen is a

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:32.795
means. And what we believe. And

01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:33.396
there is the freight the green

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:38.601
we live in. The twine with

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:39.168
compassion no the principles

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:43.206
are really. Intel integrated

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:44.841
into our belief system so I

01:00:44.907 --> 01:00:46.976
will talk about a little so you

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:50.780
can understand that I come from.

01:00:50.847 --> 01:00:51.314
A Chen community is a very

01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:54.617
small community. Even in India

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:55.184
it is less than 1% of end of

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:56.986
population. In America is about

01:00:57.053 --> 01:01:02.859
the same. And all we are about

01:01:02.925 --> 01:01:03.459
two hundred thousand James in

01:01:03.526 --> 01:01:06.696
North America US and Canada.

01:01:06.763 --> 01:01:07.263
And here in the bay area we

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:10.800
probably are about. Twenty five

01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:11.401
hundred families that are part

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:13.002
of heart. Number here in may be

01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:19.075
this. So we don't experience

01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:20.710
all the different problems that

01:01:20.777 --> 01:01:21.344
other communities of experience

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:26.616
because we are invisible. And

01:01:26.682 --> 01:01:28.651
of course in of pecan del Rio

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:30.620
in a Jan because we looked like

01:01:30.686 --> 01:01:32.989
any other Indian or any other a

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:36.926
in in America so. It's kind of

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:42.799
difficult. But we Chen said

01:01:42.865 --> 01:01:45.301
later the lenders contribution

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:46.702
to India and its culture. Far

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:51.074
beyond is numbers. In all kinds

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:54.610
of situations are open and

01:01:54.677 --> 01:01:56.679
culturally economically

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:58.948
everything a charity Gen seven

01:01:59.015 --> 01:02:03.019
to the forefront in India. En

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:03.619
route to a trying to emulate

01:02:03.686 --> 01:02:05.088
dot over here by being generous

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:10.693
in the community. So what does

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.595
it bring back to those who do

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:13.229
not much margin ism. I like to

01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:18.634
say that. Journalism arose from

01:02:18.701 --> 01:02:19.235
pension prehistorical time in

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:23.005
India. That I've never twenty

01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:26.776
four forty quality. Operators

01:02:26.843 --> 01:02:29.212
of human in all nay in nature

01:02:29.278 --> 01:02:33.182
the born human and the victims

01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:34.517
the end and they became

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:36.886
probably it'll journalism op

01:02:36.953 --> 01:02:39.088
that the twenty to thirty the-

01:02:39.155 --> 01:02:44.794
program which is impossible.

01:02:44.861 --> 01:02:45.428
Not was about eight hundred and

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:48.865
fifty BC. My average of the

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:52.835
twenty fourth. Teachings often

01:02:52.902 --> 01:02:54.971
followed now are was six

01:02:55.037 --> 01:02:58.641
hundred BC and this tool. At

01:02:58.708 --> 01:02:59.242
the moment was not it is have

01:02:59.308 --> 01:03:01.110
been accepted by historians as

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:04.714
historical people so that they

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:05.314
exist at and they'll drone the

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:09.051
land of India. Even though I

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:10.853
llama is all in of the lie là

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.855
my knees book for as a group

01:03:12.922 --> 01:03:13.389
conserve afraid describe

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:16.926
Jenny's on. As it principally

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:20.863
of. Buddhism. Because more Chen

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:25.001
is up some photos from what is

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:26.602
known as Camelot division of.

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:27.203
That was they have a long long

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:31.073
time. Many of our principles

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:33.142
are similar. Journalism is a

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:37.046
way of life. It's a philosophy

01:03:37.113 --> 01:03:39.015
and a way of life. We don't

01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:42.852
have a god creator. Because you

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:44.754
believe the universe of exist a

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:45.288
four hour and continues to

01:03:45.354 --> 01:03:48.824
exist. Nothing gets destroyed

01:03:48.891 --> 01:03:49.392
nothing gets created in the

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:54.864
works. Hands. Which survey of

01:03:54.931 --> 01:03:57.033
life and is driven by the

01:03:57.099 --> 01:04:00.970
beauty of karma. That you saw

01:04:01.037 --> 01:04:01.537
watch hello you reach such a

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:05.308
saw. And that that is how we

01:04:05.374 --> 01:04:10.746
have always constantly to be.

01:04:10.813 --> 01:04:12.748
At our best because anything

01:04:12.815 --> 01:04:13.316
that we do is going to come

01:04:13.382 --> 01:04:18.754
back to haunt him. For

01:04:18.821 --> 01:04:20.623
thousands of years Gen certain

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:22.692
practicing vegetarianism about

01:04:22.758 --> 01:04:26.629
meditation and the environment.

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:28.998
James believing that those old

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:30.967
bridges o'donnell and divine we

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:31.534
believe which are sold as a

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:33.002
Donald and divine. By the way

01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:36.906
there is no sections. So does

01:04:36.973 --> 01:04:38.908
have a sex so what we have is a

01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:42.812
body solo plaza body when it

01:04:42.878 --> 01:04:44.914
takes both. Sometimes you might

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:46.749
get a female parties under the

01:04:46.816 --> 01:04:48.751
main body sometimes you get a

01:04:48.818 --> 01:04:53.256
neutral party. In a transgender.

01:04:53.322 --> 01:04:54.490
But we also recognize that

01:04:54.557 --> 01:04:56.826
beyond the physical body which

01:04:56.892 --> 01:04:59.061
is. Which you get based on your

01:04:59.128 --> 01:05:02.665
he got the karma. Or nam karma.

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:03.199
There is actually a mental

01:05:03.266 --> 01:05:07.136
state. And so you could have a

01:05:07.203 --> 01:05:10.706
physical he in all male body

01:05:10.773 --> 01:05:11.307
but your mental state because

01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:14.710
of your of karma the type of

01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:15.211
for my dad did delude in

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:18.914
government. You could have a

01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:23.185
female magic. And that's what

01:05:23.252 --> 01:05:24.687
so we recognize that there is a

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.722
difference between the mind set

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:28.691
or room in the inclination

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:29.292
reverses the physical body you

01:05:29.358 --> 01:05:32.962
up. Which means that you should

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:35.064
be looking at if I look at you

01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:35.698
grandson and say oh grandson is

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:38.868
Chinese American. I have

01:05:38.934 --> 01:05:42.738
committed issues crime. I

01:05:42.805 --> 01:05:44.740
should be seeing you as Kansen

01:05:44.807 --> 01:05:45.374
Chu Ái servicing as a

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:51.047
soldier. Has loan Reyes there

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:56.819
there's no. No collar low S.

01:05:56.886 --> 01:05:57.420
sex nothing at all so moment

01:05:57.486 --> 01:05:58.621
think of someone else other.

01:05:58.688 --> 01:06:02.858
You are actually. Driving that

01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:06.762
violence on the person. And of

01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:08.798
course is that violence is on

01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:10.533
your part and we believe that

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:14.537
violence of talked is equally

01:06:14.603 --> 01:06:15.071
bad as violence of actual

01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:18.841
physical one. Because we

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:20.676
believe not harming himself or

01:06:20.743 --> 01:06:23.045
non violence is by after a

01:06:23.112 --> 01:06:27.016
speech and by thought. And all

01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:27.616
of them have to be controlled

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:31.220
by you. A three ton that's that

01:06:31.287 --> 01:06:32.655
we have is the second one is

01:06:32.722 --> 01:06:34.857
under god what or multi

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:36.625
procedural viewpoint. And I

01:06:36.692 --> 01:06:37.193
call that as a non while of

01:06:37.259 --> 01:06:43.165
talked. Because in our view on

01:06:43.232 --> 01:06:44.767
the multiplicity of viewpoints.

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:45.267
Look and think about the

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:49.004
other's point of view. Muscles

01:06:49.071 --> 01:06:50.773
point of view were the same.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.175
And by looking at others point

01:06:53.242 --> 01:06:54.910
of view you may see something

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:58.814
different life altogether. And

01:06:58.881 --> 01:07:00.850
that makes two thousand

01:07:00.916 --> 01:07:02.685
actually the word tolerance is

01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:04.820
not as Burke as acceptance we

01:07:04.887 --> 01:07:06.889
call it you have to accept the

01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:09.058
other stocks because there may

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:12.962
be some. Faith in its on

01:07:13.028 --> 01:07:13.596
putting it and you have to find

01:07:13.662 --> 01:07:18.901
that. Silicon Albright discard

01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:19.535
a by because of principle of an

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:22.805
icon. The other one of course

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.107
is. Of non possessiveness and

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:27.276
I'm not gonna talk about Medina

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:27.877
long position that which we

01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:29.178
have but Paul just a mental

01:07:29.245 --> 01:07:32.982
long possessiveness. Attachment

01:07:33.048 --> 01:07:34.917
to your children is mental

01:07:34.984 --> 01:07:36.852
possessiveness. Attachment to

01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:37.453
or hate to someone else is a

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.821
mentor possessiveness. It's it

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:40.923
is your mental this implies

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:42.858
that you have to control so

01:07:42.925 --> 01:07:44.994
that you would not be affected

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:50.833
by your. The very important

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.568
part of Chen philosophy is

01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:54.904
forgiveness and I want to read

01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:56.705
something one of our aphorism.

01:07:56.772 --> 01:07:59.141
Is commonly so would you agree

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:02.611
so would you recommend to me.

01:08:02.678 --> 01:08:04.847
The missile will borders so.

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:07.082
Number John McKenzie. Everybody

01:08:07.149 --> 01:08:12.588
in the store that. I forgave

01:08:12.655 --> 01:08:14.790
all of the all beings may all

01:08:14.857 --> 01:08:15.291
living beings brown who

01:08:15.357 --> 01:08:18.561
forgiveness. My friendship as

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:20.696
with all living beings I have

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:22.932
no animosity towards any that's

01:08:22.998 --> 01:08:24.633
what the effort as a means. It

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:28.938
truly says I am asking and this

01:08:29.004 --> 01:08:29.438
is the this aphorism is

01:08:29.505 --> 01:08:35.010
practical. Saved by. The

01:08:35.077 --> 01:08:36.912
challenge the bill Jones are

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:38.948
overlap baptising Gaines.

01:08:39.014 --> 01:08:42.718
Almost every single day. To do

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:43.319
mind you constantly that you

01:08:43.385 --> 01:08:44.987
have to ask for forgiveness you

01:08:45.054 --> 01:08:46.755
have to give forgiveness and

01:08:46.822 --> 01:08:50.726
forget and you should be

01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:51.327
friendly with everyone and you

01:08:51.393 --> 01:08:54.897
should. Not have any enemies I

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:58.767
would go on to that is. Another

01:08:58.834 --> 01:09:05.574
row. I will keep my time I

01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:06.742
think I better not so bad this

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:08.844
forgiveness will destroy hatred

01:09:08.911 --> 01:09:10.946
and fear. When you forgive

01:09:11.013 --> 01:09:16.619
somebody you can no longer hate.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:19.188
And possibly forgiving and also

01:09:19.255 --> 01:09:20.523
the Skinner forgiveness which

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:22.892
we do. With a worse for me

01:09:22.958 --> 01:09:23.526
Charlie but I'm- and I'm sure

01:09:23.592 --> 01:09:26.495
you heard some of those books.

01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:28.697
Which means that I'm asking for

01:09:28.764 --> 01:09:32.835
part excuse. For give me

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:33.435
because I have done something

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:38.774
wrong. Joint committee is as I

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.776
was saying is a small committee

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:41.410
is a charitable committee does

01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:42.745
a lot of chatter W. unknown

01:09:42.811 --> 01:09:45.247
projects in India. He had even

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:47.349
our youth will all to serve

01:09:47.416 --> 01:09:48.584
those at the shelter. The

01:09:48.651 --> 01:09:51.086
global serve the homeless. And

01:09:51.153 --> 01:09:54.623
we encourage our children to.

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:55.157
Participate but you know

01:09:55.224 --> 01:09:56.892
because our Sunday school

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:58.894
children. And we're getting to

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:00.996
get involved in too many of the

01:10:01.063 --> 01:10:02.665
activities not as many as I

01:10:02.731 --> 01:10:03.198
like. But because of the

01:10:03.265 --> 01:10:05.067
numbers are small and many of

01:10:05.134 --> 01:10:08.704
our people have come recently

01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:09.271
H. one B. visa guys so they

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:10.839
hadn't that that here for sort

01:10:10.906 --> 01:10:14.543
of trying. To has of course I

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:15.077
have been here fifty sixty

01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:19.248
hours so I have seen this. Land

01:10:19.315 --> 01:10:24.553
here change and this is home.

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:27.156
Never talk about the concurrent

01:10:27.222 --> 01:10:28.691
resolution a one oh eight. This

01:10:28.757 --> 01:10:30.926
is the resolution that we need

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:32.828
to have an adoption I am very

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:36.865
happy glad that are. Eminem the

01:10:36.932 --> 01:10:37.433
member Kansen Chu has taken

01:10:37.499 --> 01:10:41.003
that and- for that resolution

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:47.309
up. Any of the community like

01:10:47.376 --> 01:10:47.910
is a free will and others have

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:50.879
signed on. Site because time

01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:52.881
and I county also has signed on

01:10:52.948 --> 01:10:54.950
toward ambassadors and adapted

01:10:55.017 --> 01:11:00.723
confirmed. And I'm also

01:11:00.789 --> 01:11:01.256
represent Silicon Valley

01:11:01.323 --> 01:11:01.824
interreligious counselor the

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:03.058
war wise chair and we have been

01:11:03.125 --> 01:11:06.795
part of that effort. Promote

01:11:06.862 --> 01:11:07.363
people adopt a charter for a

01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:12.735
charter for compassion. What

01:11:12.801 --> 01:11:15.137
this will do is it'll become a

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:18.841
lighting roar lightning roar to

01:11:18.907 --> 01:11:19.475
everybody in the community in

01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:22.711
the California. Because once it

01:11:22.778 --> 01:11:24.713
is state is his added

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.116
compassionate state everybody

01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:30.686
will want to get on the band.

01:11:30.753 --> 01:11:32.855
And high hopes that enable to

01:11:32.921 --> 01:11:33.455
encourage them to get on the

01:11:33.522 --> 01:11:34.823
background and signed the

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:35.457
combatant compassion and become

01:11:35.524 --> 01:11:38.794
compassionate not just by name.

01:11:38.861 --> 01:11:39.395
Because you would have to that

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:43.098
act accordingly. Your a all of

01:11:43.165 --> 01:11:44.967
the laws you may have to be

01:11:45.034 --> 01:11:46.902
judge by the measure of

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:48.804
compassion and on maybe

01:11:48.871 --> 01:11:51.140
compassion index or something

01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:53.075
like that that we create so the

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:54.843
region's matted like the tried

01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:58.647
each item back stashed in a

01:11:58.714 --> 01:11:59.214
statement that. Many of the

01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:02.951
copies half. Those indexes can

01:12:03.018 --> 01:12:04.687
be created and we can see on

01:12:04.753 --> 01:12:05.220
the truly compassionate.

01:12:05.287 --> 01:12:06.755
There's actually a study by

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:08.791
city alluvial. Did they did

01:12:08.857 --> 01:12:10.659
what is a compassionate index

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:11.193
and they started all the

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.062
different districts to see how

01:12:13.128 --> 01:12:14.830
compassionate bill there and we

01:12:14.897 --> 01:12:16.665
will look into it after. Your

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:19.034
resolution is passed to see how

01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:22.571
that technology. That

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:26.508
methodology can help us.

01:12:26.575 --> 01:12:28.711
Measure compassion that is and

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:32.748
measure the change that happens.

01:12:32.815 --> 01:12:34.983
In my opinion the get income in

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:36.585
California as a compassionate

01:12:36.652 --> 01:12:38.754
state will foster cultural

01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:39.388
compaction compassionate action

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:40.923
and talk so if you want to

01:12:40.989 --> 01:12:41.356
create a culture of

01:12:41.423 --> 01:12:43.092
compassionate action promoting

01:12:43.158 --> 01:12:44.893
friendliness among California

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.262
residents which will help us

01:12:47.329 --> 01:12:48.630
all current community.

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:52.768
Challenges we have a blank

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:54.803
compassion games the lastly I

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:56.972
want to recommend I recommend a

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:58.807
couple things first include

01:12:58.874 --> 01:13:00.943

training in schools I non black

01:13:02.745 --> 01:13:08.584
non religious basis children

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:09.184
should learn forgiveness right

01:13:09.251 --> 01:13:12.821
from the charter. Rear tires

01:13:12.888 --> 01:13:13.455
I'm also the board member of

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:14.590

the results are. Absolutely of

01:13:29.037 --> 01:13:31.240
a sky in terms of the behavior

01:13:31.306 --> 01:13:32.875
and up so there so we should

01:13:32.941 --> 01:13:36.512
promote second is modernize

01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:48.624
measure compassionate such as

01:13:48.690 --> 01:13:49.258

01:14:38.841 --> 01:14:40.642
actually a volunteer with

01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:42.711
sickle Rhaetian and also a

01:14:42.778 --> 01:14:44.847
member of a grassroots level

01:14:44.913 --> 01:14:46.915

behind the scenes on this this

01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:11.066
is this is not something that

passed and it helps us to a

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:21.576
point where we can say. For me

01:16:21.643 --> 01:16:27.215
a second. As the. California

01:16:27.282 --> 01:16:31.219
usually is all and- select

01:16:31.286 --> 01:16:36.825
decision for each each no we

01:16:36.892 --> 01:16:41.363
met him in another it's not.

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:44.967
Shop did. It's to give you a

01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:47.002
quick overview of who six are

01:16:47.069 --> 01:16:49.104
because not everybody knows who

01:16:49.171 --> 01:16:52.808
six are the- even though in in

01:16:52.874 --> 01:16:54.843
the bay area visit believe

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:56.611
there seem to be a lot because

01:16:56.678 --> 01:16:58.680
of that our months. But there

01:16:58.747 --> 01:17:00.816
are very few six of in terms of

01:17:00.882 --> 01:17:02.918
percentage of population if you

01:17:02.985 --> 01:17:04.619
look at a number of the

01:17:04.686 --> 01:17:06.822
demographics nationwide even in

01:17:06.888 --> 01:17:11.193
India. Get six for less than 2%

01:17:11.259 --> 01:17:14.596
of the population. So what.

01:17:14.663 --> 01:17:20.736
What okay judge. Okay am I

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:22.938
doing anything okay there is

01:17:23.005 --> 01:17:26.508
there's just a lack. All right.

01:17:26.575 --> 01:17:32.914
Okay so of. Six sick ism- is it

01:17:32.981 --> 01:17:36.718
it has compassion in grand into

01:17:36.785 --> 01:17:39.154
stagings in so many ways of

01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:42.958
that- it is hard to explain it

01:17:43.025 --> 01:17:47.029
in a few words. The compassion

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:48.997
that was exemplified by founder

01:17:49.064 --> 01:17:51.233
of the faith who we call a

01:17:51.299 --> 01:17:53.035
good- the word good who has a

01:17:53.101 --> 01:17:54.970
very special meaning for six

01:17:55.037 --> 01:17:58.707
it's not an export of some kind

01:17:58.774 --> 01:18:00.742
in a subject matter Google

01:18:00.809 --> 01:18:02.577
means a person who shows you

01:18:02.644 --> 01:18:04.813
the way throughout your life.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:07.215
The person who enlightens your

01:18:07.282 --> 01:18:08.917
path. So when you his sit here

01:18:08.984 --> 01:18:12.621
lower good in the sick contacts

01:18:12.687 --> 01:18:14.923

01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:16.925
distinction so compassion was

01:18:16.992 --> 01:18:18.593
exemplified by the thick crews

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:20.762
in my many ways it is built

01:18:20.829 --> 01:18:22.898
into the golden rules of the

01:18:22.964 --> 01:18:24.966
sick faith. The six prayer the

01:18:25.033 --> 01:18:28.603
daily six prayer actually ends

01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:32.607
with the asking for well being

01:18:32.674 --> 01:18:35.077

01:28:56.864 --> 01:28:57.432
can do a mereka and foundation

01:28:57.498 --> 01:28:59.000
points north in California

this. Opportunity and

01:29:11.245 --> 01:29:11.813
organizing the event. While I'm

01:29:11.879 --> 01:29:13.281
here representing him the

01:29:13.347 --> 01:29:13.948
American foundation as you said

01:29:14.015 --> 01:29:14.882
I'm also representing the wider

01:29:14.949 --> 01:29:17.185
into our community only in

01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:20.588
California but also nationwide-

01:29:20.655 --> 01:29:22.490
I want to take the opportunity

01:29:22.557 --> 01:29:24.826
to also thank assembly members

01:29:24.892 --> 01:29:26.694
bloom Burke Kalra lackey and

01:29:26.761 --> 01:29:28.663
however for co authoring the

01:29:28.730 --> 01:29:29.197
resolution. Thank you in

01:29:29.263 --> 01:29:32.800
CinemaCon Reyes here. I'll be a

01:29:32.867 --> 01:29:34.602
little more scripted- than

01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:38.673
other presenters because I'm

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:41.008
presenting about five thousand

01:29:41.075 --> 01:29:41.476
years of story of come

01:29:41.542 --> 01:29:46.748
compassion here. So that said

01:29:46.814 --> 01:29:48.983
as a Hindu I'm glad to report

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:51.152
that I can share more than one

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:54.522
definition often those.

01:29:54.589 --> 01:29:56.958
Regardless of which ever

01:29:57.024 --> 01:30:00.828
narrative you choose- to

01:30:00.895 --> 01:30:02.997
remember your discover that

01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:03.431
Hinduism means many

01:30:03.498 --> 01:30:04.866
philosophies and schools of

01:30:04.932 --> 01:30:06.868
thought many forms to express

01:30:06.934 --> 01:30:08.703
these thoughts. And a rich

01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:12.673
tapestry of human values. The

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:15.009
more Hindus he will meet the

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:16.978
more you realize that there is

01:30:17.044 --> 01:30:18.679
not one but numerous numerous

01:30:18.746 --> 01:30:21.315
bats practices and piety there

01:30:21.382 --> 01:30:26.754
is no one perfect way our world.

01:30:26.821 --> 01:30:28.890
In fact we embrace in perfect

01:30:28.956 --> 01:30:30.591
because it lands us an

01:30:30.658 --> 01:30:31.192
opportunity to understand the

01:30:31.259 --> 01:30:35.029
world around us. Now if I were

01:30:35.096 --> 01:30:36.964
to tell you the same story but

01:30:37.031 --> 01:30:39.000
in reverse order. The narrative

01:30:39.066 --> 01:30:40.902
will be something like this.

01:30:40.968 --> 01:30:42.970
There are people in this world

01:30:43.037 --> 01:30:44.939
who are comfortable with this

01:30:45.006 --> 01:30:46.908
imperfect world that we live in.

01:30:46.974 --> 01:30:47.408
Either through their own

01:30:47.475 --> 01:30:50.845
natural constitution. All

01:30:50.912 --> 01:30:52.947
through the observation of the

01:30:53.014 --> 01:30:54.649
richness of the creation around

01:30:54.715 --> 01:30:56.951
us they have come to respect

01:30:57.018 --> 01:30:58.986
the different avenues people

01:30:59.053 --> 01:31:00.955
have historically taken. To

01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:01.522
understand the world around

01:31:01.589 --> 01:31:04.826
them. The trace this open an

01:31:04.892 --> 01:31:05.459
acceptance of parts to overturn

01:31:05.526 --> 01:31:09.230
lainnya. Too many texts art

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:12.567
forms lower and practices.

01:31:12.633 --> 01:31:16.637
These other hinders. And that

01:31:16.704 --> 01:31:18.840
is pluralism I believe off the

01:31:18.906 --> 01:31:20.842
COR offended them all beings

01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:24.879
from the smallest organism man

01:31:24.946 --> 01:31:26.814
are considered manifestations

01:31:26.881 --> 01:31:29.050
of the divine or deflections of

01:31:29.116 --> 01:31:31.085
Devine's qualities. Because of

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:34.822
this shared divinity in those

01:31:34.889 --> 01:31:36.824
views the universe as the

01:31:36.891 --> 01:31:39.093
family or as in Sanskrit we say

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:42.830
it must've they've become. The

01:31:42.897 --> 01:31:43.464
Hindu world has been able to

01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:44.966
embrace the reality of

01:31:45.032 --> 01:31:47.034
diversity and relish and

01:31:47.101 --> 01:31:47.635
religious freedom through its

01:31:47.702 --> 01:31:50.805
philosophy of pluralism. Every

01:31:50.872 --> 01:31:52.840
being with their varying likes

01:31:52.907 --> 01:31:54.742
and dislikes their own unique

01:31:54.809 --> 01:31:56.711
personalities and different

01:31:56.777 --> 01:31:58.946
cultures normally connect with

01:31:59.013 --> 01:32:00.748
one another in their own unique

01:32:00.815 --> 01:32:02.750
ways. But connect with the wind

01:32:02.817 --> 01:32:06.587
in their own individual way.

01:32:06.654 --> 01:32:08.756
This embrace of tourism has

01:32:08.823 --> 01:32:09.290
taken contributed to the

01:32:09.357 --> 01:32:09.790
incredible spiritual and

01:32:09.857 --> 01:32:12.660
religious freedom. One

01:32:12.727 --> 01:32:16.797
witnesses within Hinduism which

01:32:16.864 --> 01:32:17.431
often confuses up people in the

01:32:17.498 --> 01:32:23.404
west. The word pluralism is not

01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:24.639
just acceptable to Hindus but

01:32:24.705 --> 01:32:26.874
all members of universal family

01:32:26.941 --> 01:32:28.809
accordingly does it make

01:32:28.876 --> 01:32:29.377
knowledge is not just the

01:32:29.443 --> 01:32:32.847
possibility but also the

01:32:32.914 --> 01:32:34.582
existence of more than one path.

01:32:34.649 --> 01:32:36.817
Or way of really into the truth

01:32:36.884 --> 01:32:37.418
bath being religion and truth

01:32:37.485 --> 01:32:42.723
being caught. This is true on

01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:44.759
adulterated pluralism is

01:32:44.825 --> 01:32:45.259
captured in the ancient

01:32:45.326 --> 01:32:48.663
Sanskrit pan which are will

01:32:48.729 --> 01:32:50.765
translate in English that says

01:32:50.831 --> 01:32:53.067
truth is one the wise call it

01:32:53.134 --> 01:33:00.808
by the names. It doesn't matter

01:33:00.875 --> 01:33:01.375
which direction narrative of

01:33:01.442 --> 01:33:04.946
Hinduism. Fix your interest

01:33:05.012 --> 01:33:07.114
what you're likely to discover

01:33:07.181 --> 01:33:09.016
is that none of the diversity

01:33:09.083 --> 01:33:10.551
and richness and in the

01:33:10.618 --> 01:33:11.085
tradition would have been

01:33:11.152 --> 01:33:14.722
possible without respect. Not

01:33:14.789 --> 01:33:18.559
mere tolerance but respect. And

01:33:18.626 --> 01:33:21.028
then you will discover the

01:33:21.095 --> 01:33:21.595
substrate underneath all of

01:33:21.662 --> 01:33:22.897
this which is compassion that

01:33:22.964 --> 01:33:26.734
Hindus have not only for us but

01:33:26.801 --> 01:33:28.936
for every life form around us

01:33:29.003 --> 01:33:31.138
in fact comparison isn't

01:33:31.205 --> 01:33:31.839
grained in the ultimate goal of

01:33:31.906 --> 01:33:34.875
every- moksha or freedom from

01:33:34.942 --> 01:33:36.711
the cycle of birth and rebirth

01:33:36.777 --> 01:33:37.211
is characterized by the

01:33:37.278 --> 01:33:38.813
overcoming of spiritual

01:33:38.879 --> 01:33:41.115
ignorance the complete

01:33:41.182 --> 01:33:42.850
elimination of material desires

01:33:42.917 --> 01:33:45.019
and attachments the affected

01:33:45.086 --> 01:33:49.090
ability to live in the present

01:33:49.156 --> 01:33:49.623
moment. And XP is absolute

01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:54.862
peace. Most importantly the

01:33:54.929 --> 01:33:55.429
awakening of your compassion

01:33:55.496 --> 01:33:56.931
towards all. Dianne talked

01:33:56.998 --> 01:33:58.866
about the progression of a bit

01:33:58.933 --> 01:34:01.135
earlier off- blood ties to

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:04.772
religious ties to natural ties

01:34:04.839 --> 01:34:06.907
it by under sorted right. One

01:34:06.974 --> 01:34:12.880
man. Took that advice. Many

01:34:12.947 --> 01:34:14.882
many years ago and created one

01:34:14.949 --> 01:34:17.218
of the biggest moments which we

01:34:17.284 --> 01:34:18.819
today because the Gandhi's.

01:34:18.886 --> 01:34:20.855
Still rights disobedience

01:34:20.921 --> 01:34:24.625
moment which was non violent.

01:34:24.692 --> 01:34:26.727
And he then also influenced.

01:34:26.794 --> 01:34:29.030
Outside of his nation to the

01:34:29.096 --> 01:34:30.865
global war people like Dr king

01:34:30.931 --> 01:34:32.900
to take on with the same

01:34:32.967 --> 01:34:34.902
compassion the biggest

01:34:34.969 --> 01:34:35.536
challenges that he faced in his

01:34:35.603 --> 01:34:38.773
time and his people face for

01:34:38.839 --> 01:34:39.340
many many. Centuries before

01:34:39.407 --> 01:34:43.344
that. See this is what we

01:34:43.411 --> 01:34:47.014
cannot. Get him while we are

01:34:47.081 --> 01:34:48.883
here in California is the

01:34:48.949 --> 01:34:49.483
California's biggest story of

01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:52.887
compassion right here at home.

01:34:52.953 --> 01:34:56.957
I hình saw or non violence. Is

01:34:57.024 --> 01:34:57.491
one of the most important

01:34:57.558 --> 01:34:59.293
pillars of Hindu philosophy.

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:02.897
Concept of a hand size deeply

01:35:02.963 --> 01:35:03.431
embedded in the videos the

01:35:03.497 --> 01:35:07.168
engine in the pictures which

01:35:07.234 --> 01:35:07.802
proposed that all beings from

01:35:07.868 --> 01:35:08.602
the smallest optimism man

01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:10.905
Acosta manifestations of god

01:35:10.971 --> 01:35:14.675
and members of universal

01:35:14.742 --> 01:35:17.011
family. This word view what

01:35:17.078 --> 01:35:20.848
plans and talked. Words he'd

01:35:20.915 --> 01:35:22.783
against a living being is

01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:23.417
contrary to the natural balance

01:35:23.484 --> 01:35:26.821
of this universe. Not just

01:35:26.887 --> 01:35:27.421
physical violence but violence

01:35:27.488 --> 01:35:30.791
in fought and. And even that

01:35:30.858 --> 01:35:36.797
the. The spirituality is a more

01:35:36.864 --> 01:35:40.801
by the Hindus. Compassion is a

01:35:40.868 --> 01:35:42.536
psychological construct that

01:35:42.603 --> 01:35:43.104
day let hate to situate in a

01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:46.841
society. But the question still

01:35:46.907 --> 01:35:47.374
remains which is how do we

01:35:47.441 --> 01:35:50.711
spread compassion.

01:35:50.778 --> 01:35:51.278
Compassionate California's

01:35:51.345 --> 01:35:54.982
announced that. It encourages

01:35:55.049 --> 01:35:57.084
us to improve the lives of all

01:35:57.151 --> 01:35:58.552
can only a residents. And treat

01:35:58.619 --> 01:35:59.019
them with dignity the

01:35:59.086 --> 01:36:00.955
consistently and emphatically

01:36:01.021 --> 01:36:03.057
to frame from inflicting pain

01:36:03.124 --> 01:36:07.194
to act or speak violently out

01:36:07.261 --> 01:36:08.696
of spite or self interest

01:36:08.762 --> 01:36:09.296
towards any of the being or

01:36:09.363 --> 01:36:12.766
group of beings. Impoverishing

01:36:12.833 --> 01:36:14.835
exploit or deny basic rights to

01:36:14.902 --> 01:36:16.904
anybody and to incite hatred by

01:36:16.971 --> 01:36:18.806
denigrating others these are

01:36:18.873 --> 01:36:20.674
not my words these are the

01:36:20.741 --> 01:36:22.643
works. Of the resolution that

01:36:22.710 --> 01:36:25.246
you folks have written great

01:37:13.794 --> 01:37:15.229
two. Require peace officers to

01:37:15.296 --> 01:37:17.731
and- comprehensive training on

01:37:17.798 --> 01:37:19.033
hate crimes to better identify

01:37:19.099 --> 01:37:22.870
and respond to hate crimes.

01:37:22.937 --> 01:37:23.404
Then you also talked about

01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:28.742
legislating compassion. Earlier

01:37:28.809 --> 01:37:30.811
our new use the word impossible

01:37:30.878 --> 01:37:31.345
or difficult but something

01:37:31.412 --> 01:37:34.848
along those lines. But I think

01:37:34.915 --> 01:37:35.349
that's only half of the

01:37:35.416 --> 01:37:38.819
equation. Even if we manage to

01:37:38.886 --> 01:37:40.721
legislate compassion which I

01:37:40.788 --> 01:37:43.290
think we are sincerely wanting

01:37:43.357 --> 01:37:43.891
to do that's what I'm sensing

01:37:43.958 --> 01:37:46.694
the. With the with the strength

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:48.762
in which we have shown up. The

01:37:48.829 --> 01:37:50.898
young people that I think is

01:37:50.965 --> 01:37:51.432
the future of California I

01:37:51.498 --> 01:37:52.600
think will be successful in it.

01:37:52.666 --> 01:37:53.234
We have to promote a culture of

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:56.937
compassion. It is the only

01:37:57.004 --> 01:37:58.739
sensible approach to making

01:37:58.806 --> 01:37:59.306
such a diverse collection of

01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:02.610
people have in California a

01:38:02.676 --> 01:38:03.244
place that is safe peaceful and

01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:05.145
welcoming. But compassion is

01:38:05.212 --> 01:38:08.716
more than just. About being

01:38:08.782 --> 01:38:09.383
able to call up a home and feel

01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:10.985
safe and secure. A bigger

01:38:11.051 --> 01:38:12.920
outcome of compassion. Is the

01:38:12.987 --> 01:38:14.822
diversity dividend. Which we

01:38:14.888 --> 01:38:17.424
are already reaping hearings at

01:38:17.491 --> 01:38:20.928
in Silicon Valley. But we have

01:38:20.995 --> 01:38:21.528
a bigger opportunity in front

01:38:21.595 --> 01:38:23.330
of us so even if you are not a

01:38:23.397 --> 01:38:26.500
person who believes in combat

01:38:26.567 --> 01:38:27.167
is an out of. Compassion out of

01:38:27.234 --> 01:38:28.669
spirituality if you are

01:38:28.736 --> 01:38:30.871
business minded person

01:38:30.938 --> 01:38:31.338
capitalist a hardcore

01:38:31.405 --> 01:38:35.476
capitalist. There is a story of

01:38:35.542 --> 01:38:38.712
compassionate California that

01:38:38.779 --> 01:38:39.280
only propel us even farther

01:38:39.346 --> 01:38:42.650
father had. On the global

01:38:42.716 --> 01:38:43.250
economic index if they were to

01:38:43.317 --> 01:38:49.123
be one. Hindus have a thousand

01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.790
a few thousand years of history

01:38:49.857 --> 01:38:51.091
to share as evidence-

01:38:51.158 --> 01:38:54.695
compassion is not a political

01:38:54.762 --> 01:38:55.262
necessity it doesn't exist

01:38:55.329 --> 01:38:55.863
existentialists yesterday. And

01:38:55.929 --> 01:38:59.400
then. About a billion of us who

01:38:59.466 --> 01:39:01.168
can tell you that it works. So

01:39:01.235 --> 01:39:02.670
with that thank you again for

01:39:02.736 --> 01:39:04.738
the opportunity thank you

01:39:04.805 --> 01:39:05.339
assembly members and thank you

01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:18.986

01:39:22.856 --> 01:39:26.627
valuable as you understand.

01:39:26.694 --> 01:39:28.862
What our community needs you

01:39:29.463 --> 01:39:31.165
minutes- sure okay how how long

can we keep this room. So don't

01:39:40.841 --> 01:39:42.876
get don't do many ideas. All

01:39:52.586 --> 01:39:55.022
so before we can go back to the

01:39:55.089 --> 01:39:57.224

01:40:44.671 --> 01:40:44.738
.

01:40:44.738 --> 01:40:46.607
Hello of my name's Kristy park

01:40:46.673 --> 01:40:48.609
and I'm originally eerie and

01:40:48.675 --> 01:40:50.944
we're from archbishop many high

01:40:51.011 --> 01:40:51.545
school representing the midi

01:40:51.612 --> 01:40:54.648
advocacy project our schools

01:40:54.715 --> 01:40:55.215
student run social justice

01:40:55.282 --> 01:40:57.151
advocacy club on thank you so

01:40:57.217 --> 01:40:59.186
much for having us here and to

01:40:59.253 --> 01:41:00.954
his Chen for inviting us of

01:41:01.021 --> 01:41:02.890
it's really great opportunity

01:41:02.956 --> 01:41:05.259
of end we think that a ACR one

01:41:05.325 --> 01:41:07.461
away is really great because it

01:41:07.528 --> 01:41:08.695
perfectly aligns with our

01:41:08.762 --> 01:41:11.064
mission of creating a

01:41:11.131 --> 01:41:12.599
compassionate community- one

01:41:12.666 --> 01:41:14.635
bond and empathy and okay

01:41:14.701 --> 01:41:15.202
understanding- and as father

01:41:15.269 --> 01:41:17.171
John in ms Fisher talked about

01:41:17.237 --> 01:41:18.906
creating a- space for open

01:41:18.972 --> 01:41:21.375
dialogue. And that's one of the

01:41:21.442 --> 01:41:22.643
things that we really pursued

01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:24.845
during our of time that maybe

01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:27.080
because we've invited speakers

01:41:27.147 --> 01:41:28.982
such as the National Alliance

01:41:29.049 --> 01:41:30.751
on mental illness as well as

01:41:30.818 --> 01:41:32.753
the Brady campaign now

01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:33.420
participated in strikes such as

01:41:33.487 --> 01:41:35.088
the climate strike out and

01:41:35.155 --> 01:41:36.857
we've created all these

01:41:36.924 --> 01:41:37.491
opportunities because we think

01:41:37.558 --> 01:41:38.892
it's really important to create

01:41:38.959 --> 01:41:40.928
a space thoughts open to so

01:41:40.994 --> 01:41:42.463
many different perspectives-

01:41:42.529 --> 01:41:48.836
and to have the opportunity. To

01:41:48.902 --> 01:41:49.269
gain a more holistic

01:41:49.336 --> 01:41:52.806
understanding of our community.

01:41:52.873 --> 01:41:53.407
Yeah and that's why we believe

01:41:53.474 --> 01:41:55.275
that the guidance that would be

01:41:55.342 --> 01:41:55.909
foster under having a community

01:41:55.976 --> 01:41:56.543
of compassion and having such a

01:41:56.610 --> 01:41:57.177
framework would be so important

01:41:57.244 --> 01:41:57.811
especially in the regime of you

01:41:57.878 --> 01:41:59.313
know building more supportive

01:41:59.379 --> 01:42:00.681
and compassionate communities.

01:42:00.747 --> 01:42:02.683
So in light of this initiative

01:42:02.749 --> 01:42:03.317
we've come up with a couple of

01:42:03.383 --> 01:42:04.918
ideas for tangible Paul

01:42:04.985 --> 01:42:06.687
implementation to back having

01:42:06.753 --> 01:42:07.321
this statute of the theoretical

01:42:07.387 --> 01:42:11.024
resolution. So our first idea

01:42:11.091 --> 01:42:14.661
is to integrate more hate crime

01:42:14.728 --> 01:42:15.229
prevention training within

01:42:15.295 --> 01:42:16.763
school the school curriculum-

01:42:16.830 --> 01:42:18.565
starting all the way from

01:42:18.632 --> 01:42:20.567
kindergarten up to senior year

01:42:20.634 --> 01:42:22.703
of high school. So last year

01:42:22.769 --> 01:42:23.337
actually in my junior year I'm

01:42:23.403 --> 01:42:24.905
a senior currently of I took a

01:42:24.972 --> 01:42:27.007
social justice class and one of

01:42:27.074 --> 01:42:28.575
the units that was the most

01:42:28.642 --> 01:42:30.744
impactful for me was a unit on

01:42:30.811 --> 01:42:32.846
implicit bias. And so basically

01:42:32.913 --> 01:42:34.715
what we did during that time

01:42:34.781 --> 01:42:35.315
was we took a couple of test

01:42:35.382 --> 01:42:37.017
that pinpointed specific our

01:42:37.084 --> 01:42:38.952
biases. Thought were I guess

01:42:39.019 --> 01:42:40.821
intrinsic within our

01:42:40.888 --> 01:42:41.455
perspective the I wasn't even

01:42:41.522 --> 01:42:43.290
aware about. And I think

01:42:43.357 --> 01:42:45.125
thought was a prime of moment

01:42:45.192 --> 01:42:48.595
for me in shaping and I guess I

01:42:48.662 --> 01:42:49.129
understanding where I was

01:42:49.196 --> 01:42:51.031
coming from and understanding

01:42:51.098 --> 01:42:52.966
the people around me. And so in

01:42:53.033 --> 01:42:56.703
light of that we are think side

01:42:56.770 --> 01:42:58.672
integrating more training on

01:42:58.739 --> 01:42:59.273
hate crime prevention within

01:42:59.339 --> 01:43:02.643
schools- such as activities

01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:03.310
Taylor to grade levels such as

01:43:03.377 --> 01:43:04.878
addressing stereo types in

01:43:04.945 --> 01:43:06.713
decreasing the casual

01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:09.149
integration of. Racial slurs

01:43:09.216 --> 01:43:10.918
or- name calling and students

01:43:10.984 --> 01:43:12.819
everyday vernacular that's just

01:43:12.886 --> 01:43:16.590
way too casual to be correct of

01:43:16.657 --> 01:43:17.157
would be of. Important first

01:43:17.224 --> 01:43:20.928
step to take. And we also want

01:43:20.994 --> 01:43:22.796
to emphasize the need for

01:43:22.863 --> 01:43:23.463
awareness both in our community

01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:24.665
through local events or even in

01:43:24.731 --> 01:43:25.232
libraries like through the

01:43:25.299 --> 01:43:27.067
research that we've done we

01:43:27.134 --> 01:43:28.669
found that. This violence

01:43:28.735 --> 01:43:29.236
against Pacific communities

01:43:29.303 --> 01:43:31.071
especially minority communities

01:43:31.138 --> 01:43:33.273
is gotten so common that it's

01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:34.908
become normal and as I'm sure

01:43:34.975 --> 01:43:36.944
everyone knows that this is not

01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:38.712
normal and it's not okay. And

01:43:38.779 --> 01:43:39.279
this is especially the case

01:43:39.346 --> 01:43:41.148
because individuals don't have

01:43:41.214 --> 01:43:42.783
the needed resources or access

01:43:42.849 --> 01:43:44.718
to the kind of community

01:43:44.785 --> 01:43:46.920
atmosphere that they require to

01:43:46.987 --> 01:43:47.521
have the resolutions to these.

01:43:47.588 --> 01:43:50.691
Hate crimes both in the in a

01:43:50.757 --> 01:43:51.291
workplace or even on just a

01:43:51.358 --> 01:43:54.695
regular cat colloquial level

01:43:54.761 --> 01:43:55.329
like Christy talked about- and

01:43:55.395 --> 01:43:57.064
that's why I'm gonna awareness

01:43:57.130 --> 01:43:58.732
we feel like we should have. A

01:43:58.799 --> 01:44:01.301
repeal or even a redefinition

01:44:01.368 --> 01:44:02.703
of for by which is which stands

01:44:02.769 --> 01:44:04.605
for the federal education

01:44:04.671 --> 01:44:06.740
rights and privacy act and

01:44:06.807 --> 01:44:08.809
it's- so the statue like. You

01:44:08.875 --> 01:44:09.443
to remote privacy among school

01:44:09.509 --> 01:44:10.811
communities it actually makes

01:44:10.877 --> 01:44:12.746
it's almost impossible for

01:44:12.813 --> 01:44:14.648
individuals to come forward

01:44:14.715 --> 01:44:15.282
when they have experience hate

01:44:15.349 --> 01:44:16.883
crimes and it's especially

01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:18.819
important in the school context

01:44:18.885 --> 01:44:20.687
for youth like us. Because as

01:44:20.754 --> 01:44:21.321
we've seen first hand in other

01:44:21.388 --> 01:44:23.056
schools other communities

01:44:23.123 --> 01:44:24.891
school resource officers often

01:44:24.958 --> 01:44:26.793
criminalize individuals Ashley

01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:28.729
minority youth for the most

01:44:28.795 --> 01:44:30.530
menial I'm kind of infractions.

01:44:30.597 --> 01:44:31.031
And it's this kind of

01:44:31.098 --> 01:44:33.100
legislation that prevents

01:44:33.166 --> 01:44:33.767
individuals from coming forward

01:44:33.834 --> 01:44:35.068
to talk about the violence in

01:44:35.135 --> 01:44:36.770
the communities and be able to

01:44:36.837 --> 01:44:39.072
vocalize that this is in fact

01:44:39.139 --> 01:44:41.174
not what we as a community

01:44:41.241 --> 01:44:41.808
should or need to stand for.

01:44:41.875 --> 01:44:47.247
And. We think that having this

01:44:47.314 --> 01:44:50.817
framework of having this. For

01:44:50.884 --> 01:44:53.153
compassion within California is

01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:53.754
so importance because a it's

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:54.955
necessary to get rid of this

01:44:55.022 --> 01:44:55.589
kind of stigma for help seeking

01:44:55.656 --> 01:44:56.223
and the ability for individuals

01:44:56.289 --> 01:44:56.823
to come forward and promote.

01:44:56.890 --> 01:44:58.792
More representation both in

01:44:58.859 --> 01:45:00.627
front of. In front of audiences

01:45:00.694 --> 01:45:02.696
as well as creates a better

01:45:02.763 --> 01:45:03.296
community for everyone to feel

01:45:03.363 --> 01:45:09.169
embraced. Great thank you very

01:45:09.236 --> 01:45:13.340
much. Well to more through them

01:45:13.407 --> 01:45:13.874
from meeting high school.

01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:18.779
Please come forward. And to

01:45:18.845 --> 01:45:19.312
have any limitation on the

01:45:19.379 --> 01:45:22.783
public comment. Two minutes.

01:45:22.849 --> 01:45:26.887
Okay. Hello everyone all our

01:45:26.953 --> 01:45:27.521
names are issued by the north

01:45:27.587 --> 01:45:31.024
and mobile auger wall and-

01:45:31.091 --> 01:45:31.591
we're also from the media

01:45:31.658 --> 01:45:32.826
advocacy project on under the

01:45:32.893 --> 01:45:34.895
policy consultants for this

01:45:34.961 --> 01:45:37.064
area but so we also agree with

01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:38.765
the- compassion for the- the

01:45:38.832 --> 01:45:40.934
mandate for compassion but we

01:45:41.001 --> 01:45:42.636
believe that in order to of all

01:45:42.703 --> 01:45:43.170
this like a review and-

01:45:43.236 --> 01:45:45.272
Christie said we need to have

01:45:45.338 --> 01:45:47.007
some concrete legislation so we

01:45:47.074 --> 01:45:48.742
have a few different ideas for

01:45:48.809 --> 01:45:50.944
this so one of our ideas about

01:45:51.011 --> 01:45:52.679
per people funding so

01:45:52.746 --> 01:45:55.048
California's spending billions

01:45:55.115 --> 01:45:56.883
of dollars and recently I read

01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:58.752
on the news that Gavin Newsom

01:45:58.819 --> 01:45:59.319
is going to sign one of the

01:45:59.386 --> 01:46:00.721
biggest- federal or state

01:46:00.787 --> 01:46:02.856
mandates for education in the

01:46:02.923 --> 01:46:04.958
history of California. However

01:46:05.025 --> 01:46:06.660
something that we thought was

01:46:06.727 --> 01:46:08.762
like kind of striking was that

01:46:08.829 --> 01:46:09.229
the per pupil funding

01:46:09.296 --> 01:46:11.164
specifically is limited so what

01:46:11.231 --> 01:46:12.933
we think is that the per pupil

01:46:12.999 --> 01:46:14.901
funding should be expanded

01:46:14.968 --> 01:46:16.703
because what's going on right

01:46:16.770 --> 01:46:18.772
now is that schools aren't able

01:46:18.839 --> 01:46:20.807
to find out orange is specially

01:46:20.874 --> 01:46:22.943
cam low income schools in like

01:46:23.009 --> 01:46:24.611
low income areas aren't able to

01:46:24.678 --> 01:46:25.212
find an adequately provide the

01:46:25.278 --> 01:46:29.082
education and resources needed

01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.583
to foster like a safe

01:46:29.649 --> 01:46:30.050
educational learning

01:46:30.117 --> 01:46:30.851
environment so that's why we

01:46:30.917 --> 01:46:33.053
think if we increase per pupil

01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:34.988
funding that can foster a

01:46:35.055 --> 01:46:36.656
better educational environment

01:46:36.723 --> 01:46:38.792
for these children to succeed

01:46:38.859 --> 01:46:40.560
I'm and learn I'm also teachers

01:46:40.627 --> 01:46:43.296
lack the available resources in

01:46:43.363 --> 01:46:43.897
order to create search safe

01:46:43.964 --> 01:46:44.765
environment so. By increasing

01:46:44.831 --> 01:46:47.067
per pupil funding we think that

01:46:47.134 --> 01:46:47.768
these teachers will be a better

01:46:47.834 --> 01:46:50.704
able to stir such safe and

01:46:50.771 --> 01:46:52.606
environments and further

01:46:52.672 --> 01:46:54.941
different forms. Of education

01:46:55.008 --> 01:46:55.509
that a reaching Christy were

01:46:55.575 --> 01:47:01.081
talking about. So in addition

01:47:01.148 --> 01:47:01.715
another thing that believes is

01:47:01.782 --> 01:47:02.883
that school funding should not

01:47:02.949 --> 01:47:03.517
be biased towards a high income

01:47:03.583 --> 01:47:04.885
areas. However on the certain

01:47:04.951 --> 01:47:05.418
policies that are in place

01:47:05.485 --> 01:47:06.620
right now seem to be leaning

01:47:06.686 --> 01:47:08.688
towards these ideas. Currently

01:47:08.755 --> 01:47:09.256
many low income schools in

01:47:09.322 --> 01:47:11.124
areas of several students are

01:47:11.191 --> 01:47:12.893
not able to go to- school as

01:47:12.959 --> 01:47:14.828
often because they have less

01:47:14.895 --> 01:47:15.428
income. And that's why we're

01:47:15.495 --> 01:47:16.997
seeing right now that there-

01:47:17.063 --> 01:47:19.132
school absenteeism in the lower

01:47:19.199 --> 01:47:20.834
income areas are it is around

01:47:20.901 --> 01:47:22.669
13% compared to four percent.

01:47:22.736 --> 01:47:23.303
In areas with our well I'm I'm

01:47:23.370 --> 01:47:25.138
Bridger hoods and so this

01:47:25.205 --> 01:47:26.907
causes a sort of a vicious

01:47:26.973 --> 01:47:28.742
cycle in which- the people who

01:47:28.809 --> 01:47:31.044
are that these people are less

01:47:31.111 --> 01:47:31.678
incentivized to go to school in

01:47:31.745 --> 01:47:32.979
the first place. Because of the

01:47:33.046 --> 01:47:35.048
fact that our current system it

01:47:35.115 --> 01:47:36.850
funds the schools based on the

01:47:36.917 --> 01:47:38.485
attendance a not the actual-

01:47:38.552 --> 01:47:40.720
enrollment in the school which

01:47:40.787 --> 01:47:41.354
means the overall less people

01:47:41.421 --> 01:47:43.023
are incentivized to go to

01:47:43.089 --> 01:47:44.758
school in the first place.

01:47:44.825 --> 01:47:45.392
Since there's less funding as

01:47:45.458 --> 01:47:47.093
the absenteeism and this

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:48.795
creates a sort of cycle when

01:47:48.862 --> 01:47:49.462
which blessed people a less and

01:47:49.529 --> 01:47:50.964
less people go to school in

01:47:51.031 --> 01:47:52.699
these low income areas. So we

01:47:52.766 --> 01:47:54.601
believe that we should be able

01:47:54.668 --> 01:47:55.235
to stop this by making it based

01:47:55.302 --> 01:47:56.837
on enrollment. And not based

01:47:56.903 --> 01:48:00.841
on. The of the of amount of

01:48:00.907 --> 01:48:02.742
attendance in the school. So

01:48:02.809 --> 01:48:04.845
just to close off map firmly

01:48:04.911 --> 01:48:06.613
believes that the compassion a

01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:07.247
resolution should be supported

01:48:07.314 --> 01:48:09.082
and it'll be in it would play a

01:48:09.149 --> 01:48:10.717
key role in the-

01:48:10.784 --> 01:48:11.284
implementations of. Several

01:48:11.351 --> 01:48:13.053
programs throughout. The state

01:48:13.119 --> 01:48:15.055
and- you be unifying force

01:48:15.121 --> 01:48:16.957
among schools and also greeting

01:48:17.023 --> 01:48:18.592
California is one of the first

01:48:18.658 --> 01:48:19.159
compassionate states would

01:48:19.226 --> 01:48:20.760
serve as a good model not only

01:48:20.827 --> 01:48:22.929
for California but- I think for

01:48:22.996 --> 01:48:23.530
the country as well. Proving

01:48:23.597 --> 01:48:25.031
that we are compassionate and

01:48:25.098 --> 01:48:27.033
we do truly care about our

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:27.667
neighbors and the people around

01:48:27.734 --> 01:48:32.806
us so. Thank you for your time

01:48:32.873 --> 01:48:33.340
again and- thank you. Yeah

01:48:33.406 --> 01:48:42.549

01:51:42.962 --> 01:51:44.764
that we just recently put out-

01:51:44.831 --> 01:51:46.833
of a survey that place of-

01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:49.235
about fifteen hundred students

01:51:49.302 --> 01:51:50.770
across California asking them

01:51:50.837 --> 01:51:51.371
what their experiences are in

01:51:51.438 --> 01:51:53.139
school and we found that again

01:51:53.206 --> 01:51:54.941
40% of them had said that they

01:51:55.008 --> 01:51:56.743
had experienced some form. Of

01:51:56.810 --> 01:51:58.778
bowling in not only from-

01:51:58.845 --> 01:52:00.980
fellow students but also from

01:52:01.047 --> 01:52:02.816
their teachers and that is

01:52:02.882 --> 01:52:05.051
really concerned so that's why

01:52:05.118 --> 01:52:06.853
we had worked with- the

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:08.755
assembly and actually work with

01:52:08.822 --> 01:52:11.091
a- to. A two bills the safe

01:52:11.157 --> 01:52:12.926
place to learn act one that

01:52:12.992 --> 01:52:15.028
would provide- school site and

01:52:15.095 --> 01:52:18.465
online resources to deal with

01:52:18.531 --> 01:52:18.998
bowling based on one's-

01:52:19.065 --> 01:52:20.967
religious affiliation once

01:52:21.034 --> 01:52:23.036
percent relapse affiliations

01:52:23.103 --> 01:52:24.804
that passed in two thousand

01:52:24.871 --> 01:52:26.806
sixteen and also your for that

01:52:26.873 --> 01:52:28.808
so thank you so much- we also.

01:52:28.875 --> 01:52:30.810
Ask another bill in two

01:52:30.877 --> 01:52:36.883
thousand eighteen which. Would

01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:37.484
provide training for teachers

01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:38.017
on how to deal with these

01:52:38.084 --> 01:52:44.958
issues. Again you know while

01:52:45.024 --> 01:52:45.558
it's true we cannot legislate

01:52:45.625 --> 01:52:46.759
compassion we cannot legislate

01:52:46.826 --> 01:52:47.360
tolerance or whatnot. At the

01:52:47.427 --> 01:52:48.995
same time it is important to

01:52:49.062 --> 01:52:49.629
have are like to the officials.

01:52:49.696 --> 01:52:51.064
Pass these type of- you know

01:52:51.131 --> 01:52:52.765
bills or ordinances or what not

01:52:52.832 --> 01:52:53.266
and I think that this

01:52:53.333 --> 01:52:53.800
resolution the compassion

01:52:53.867 --> 01:52:54.901
resolution. Is I definitely I a

01:52:54.968 --> 01:52:56.703
big step in the right direction

01:52:56.769 --> 01:52:58.938
to ensure that we as California

01:52:59.005 --> 01:53:01.107
state that we want to have a

01:53:01.174 --> 01:53:02.742
compassionate state. And we

01:53:02.809 --> 01:53:04.611
need to work together in order

01:53:04.677 --> 01:53:06.913
to do this and so- you know I.

01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:09.115
Hope to work with you and I

01:53:09.182 --> 01:53:11.651
hope to work with them that the

01:53:11.718 --> 01:53:12.252
members of our community in

01:53:12.318 --> 01:53:14.821
order to create a more

01:53:14.888 --> 01:53:15.455
compassionate community because

01:53:15.522 --> 01:53:16.623
we can't do this alone we- do

01:53:16.689 --> 01:53:18.758
this together and we are

01:53:18.825 --> 01:53:19.392
stronger together- so what what

01:53:19.459 --> 01:53:22.762

01:53:22.829 --> 01:53:23.429

01:54:25.091 --> 01:54:26.859
the country criticized for

01:54:26.926 --> 01:54:27.427
compassion we feel that our

01:54:27.493 --> 01:54:30.763
compassion is our strength. We

01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:31.364
have to do things together in

01:54:31.431 --> 01:54:34.701

crimes against the people of

01:54:39.072 --> 01:54:40.607
different faiths of now a

01:54:40.673 --> 01:54:41.241

of different races have

01:54:41.808 --> 01:54:44.911
increase. And we had teachers

01:54:44.978 --> 01:54:46.813
who harassed in this county. We

01:54:46.879 --> 01:54:49.148
have I've had student move away

01:54:49.215 --> 01:54:51.017
because the parents could not

01:54:51.084 --> 01:54:51.551
stand the harassing to get

01:54:51.618 --> 01:54:54.654

a teacher you know we sometimes

01:54:57.423 --> 01:55:00.760
get carried away. Yeah we are

yeah all these great crimes a

01:55:19.579 --> 01:55:22.915
risen based on the Brewster

01:55:22.982 --> 01:55:23.383
rhetoric coming out of

01:55:23.449 --> 01:55:23.983
Washington from our so called

01:55:24.050 --> 01:55:27.020

hatred and bigotry you know

01:55:36.896 --> 01:55:38.731

Bible about the treatment

01:55:39.332 --> 01:55:40.933

01:56:49.369 --> 01:56:52.672
good dialogue about the

01:56:52.739 --> 01:56:54.774

patience as well- next all like

01:57:46.959 --> 01:57:48.861
to call all rock then rex fans

01:57:48.928 --> 01:57:49.529
to bring a friend of mine I am

01:57:49.595 --> 01:57:52.765
very a strong advocate for the

01:57:52.832 --> 01:58:02.742
LGBTQ. Community rock fan.

01:58:02.809 --> 01:58:03.342
Thank you for this moment to

01:58:03.409 --> 01:58:05.545
address you. My name is rocks

01:58:05.611 --> 01:58:05.978
and I'm advocate for

01:58:06.045 --> 01:58:06.979
transgender women- I just want

01:58:07.046 --> 01:58:07.613
to go I recognize that we face

01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:09.148
a 100% unemployment there's not

01:58:09.215 --> 01:58:09.715
one of its employed in the

01:58:09.782 --> 01:58:12.718
legislature. And in our own

01:58:12.785 --> 01:58:13.286
legislature in Sacramento at

01:58:13.352 --> 01:58:16.923
any level. And I say that 80%

01:58:16.989 --> 01:58:18.891
of we have an 80% murder rate

01:58:18.958 --> 01:58:20.827
now I know why to define murder

01:58:20.893 --> 01:58:22.829
different because you all know

01:58:22.895 --> 01:58:24.964
about trans women getting

01:58:25.031 --> 01:58:25.565
beaten knife to killed in the

01:58:25.631 --> 01:58:27.166
street. But the factor my

01:58:27.233 --> 01:58:30.803
community is so afraid to go

01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:31.370
outside that when they do

01:58:31.437 --> 01:58:32.972
they're covered up and they do

01:58:33.039 --> 01:58:34.941
the best not to present as a

01:58:35.007 --> 01:58:37.043
trans woman. So what do they do

01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:40.713
they stay in that room. And I

01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:41.314
don't care how strong you are

01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:43.249
you can't stay in your room for

01:58:43.316 --> 01:58:45.351
ever. When you become afraid to

01:58:45.418 --> 01:58:48.855
walk out your front door. At

01:58:48.921 --> 01:58:50.623
some point you kill yourself

01:58:50.690 --> 01:58:51.290
and I think that's just society

01:58:51.357 --> 01:58:53.659
killing us the slow way. That's

01:58:53.726 --> 01:58:56.963
how we get to the 80% The death

01:58:57.029 --> 01:58:59.332
threats. It's happened to me

01:58:59.398 --> 01:59:02.802
twice in the last two years San

01:59:02.869 --> 01:59:03.402
Jose P. D. won't even show up

01:59:03.469 --> 01:59:08.708
to take a report. So and you

01:59:08.774 --> 01:59:10.743
know A. B. six fifty just got

01:59:10.810 --> 01:59:11.177
killed this year in

01:59:11.244 --> 01:59:13.012
appropriations that was Evan

01:59:13.079 --> 01:59:14.981
low's. Attempt to say that when

01:59:15.047 --> 01:59:17.083
were murdered. Were at least

01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:18.885
worth a check mark in law

01:59:18.951 --> 01:59:20.953
enforcement killed that bill

01:59:21.020 --> 01:59:24.957
so- that is the hurdle that you

01:59:25.024 --> 01:59:26.893
have to go through I own a

01:59:26.959 --> 01:59:28.961
house up in. By writing. I'm

01:59:29.028 --> 01:59:31.063
actually afraid to go up there

01:59:31.130 --> 01:59:32.798
and I'm selling my house

01:59:32.865 --> 01:59:34.800
because it's just not safe for

01:59:34.867 --> 01:59:38.671
me to go up there anymore. Info

01:59:38.738 --> 01:59:40.673
if finally I want to stress

01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:41.307
that this is not just because

01:59:41.374 --> 01:59:43.509
people think we dress funny and

01:59:43.576 --> 01:59:44.810
of our appearance this is been

01:59:44.877 --> 01:59:48.714
institutionalized hate. In the

01:59:48.781 --> 01:59:50.883
eight in fifty four cities in

01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:52.652
this state passed laws that

01:59:52.718 --> 01:59:57.056
said wearing the dress of the

01:59:57.123 --> 01:59:58.958
opposite sex. Is he went to

01:59:59.025 --> 02:00:02.728
prison. You went to jail for

02:00:02.795 --> 02:00:05.097
six months in if you can did it

02:00:05.164 --> 02:00:08.868
the second time. You are a race

02:00:08.935 --> 02:00:10.803
from society put an insane

02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:11.370
asylum for the rest of your

02:00:11.437 --> 02:00:16.876
life. So it's the imp the

02:00:16.943 --> 02:00:18.844
students talked about implicit

02:00:18.911 --> 02:00:20.680
bias and that's basically what

02:00:20.746 --> 02:00:24.584
we face I would just add a

02:00:24.650 --> 02:00:25.184
convention in Sacramento this

02:00:25.251 --> 02:00:28.888
week. A professor from UCSF

02:00:28.955 --> 02:00:31.057
which claims to know all about

02:00:31.123 --> 02:00:31.657
us. Got up and gave a lecture

02:00:31.724 --> 02:00:34.994
on empathy. But what was the

02:00:35.061 --> 02:00:40.700
example he used. It was a man

02:00:40.766 --> 02:00:42.602
wearing high heels. And he

02:00:42.668 --> 02:00:46.739
thought it was funny I don't.

02:00:46.806 --> 02:00:48.741
So I'll close in asking and

02:00:48.808 --> 02:00:52.712
addressing the audience. I know

02:00:52.778 --> 02:00:55.414
when I walk in here most of you

02:00:55.481 --> 02:00:55.982
say. Have nothing in common

02:00:56.048 --> 02:01:04.890
with trans. We what is life.

02:01:04.957 --> 02:01:06.993
One car pulls up behind this

02:01:07.059 --> 02:01:07.526
week's we steering wheel a

02:01:07.593 --> 02:01:11.263
little tighter. When we will

02:01:11.330 --> 02:01:13.165
know what it's like to judge

02:01:13.232 --> 02:01:17.203
just by our appearance. We what

02:01:17.269 --> 02:01:19.138
it's like to lose jobs not get

02:01:19.205 --> 02:01:22.808
jobs just because of our repair.

02:01:22.875 --> 02:01:25.311
And I think that goes for me

02:01:25.378 --> 02:01:25.911
communities and we would like

02:01:25.978 --> 02:01:30.850
to join you in changing. The

02:01:30.916 --> 02:01:32.718
acceptance of hate against all

02:01:32.785 --> 02:01:34.754
of this because of our parents.

02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:41.127
Thank you very much. How old

02:01:41.193 --> 02:01:42.928

02:02:09.188 --> 02:02:19.098
Alison Huron. Good evening

02:02:19.165 --> 02:02:19.632
assembly member Kansen Chu

02:02:19.699 --> 02:02:22.702
assembly member ash Kalra. Vice

02:02:22.768 --> 02:02:25.071
mayor Koch saw one and- school

02:02:25.137 --> 02:02:28.607
board president Chris nor would

02:02:28.674 --> 02:02:30.776
I am so glad that you chose to

02:02:30.843 --> 02:02:31.310
have this event here in

02:02:31.377 --> 02:02:35.047
Milpitas- I am president of

02:02:35.114 --> 02:02:35.581
sunny hills neighborhood

02:02:35.648 --> 02:02:37.216
association and a member of the

02:02:37.283 --> 02:02:38.884
mission peak Unitarian

02:02:38.951 --> 02:02:39.485
universalist congregation and

02:02:39.552 --> 02:02:44.857
Fremont. I did not have the

02:02:44.924 --> 02:02:48.627
pleasure of attending the. The

02:02:48.694 --> 02:02:50.930
discussions that you had in

02:02:50.996 --> 02:02:52.965
Fremont about the- possibility

02:02:53.032 --> 02:02:57.103
of. Creating a homeless

02:02:57.169 --> 02:03:02.842
navigation center. Fremont is a

02:03:02.908 --> 02:03:04.677
compassionate city according to

02:03:04.744 --> 02:03:07.046
the ordinance that you pastor

02:03:07.113 --> 02:03:08.881
proclamation that you passed in

02:03:08.948 --> 02:03:10.883
Fremont and yet people I've

02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:12.685
heard through friends who were

02:03:12.752 --> 02:03:14.653
in attendance at that meeting

02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:17.022
at those meetings or saying

02:03:17.089 --> 02:03:18.524
terrible things about homeless

02:03:18.591 --> 02:03:20.860
people who for the most part

02:03:20.926 --> 02:03:22.995
are homeless because they can't

02:03:23.062 --> 02:03:24.830
afford the housing prices here.

02:03:24.897 --> 02:03:26.766
Because they can't afford the

02:03:26.832 --> 02:03:30.870
rapidly increasing runs because

02:03:30.936 --> 02:03:31.537
they may have a fixed income or

02:03:31.604 --> 02:03:36.742
disability or- a mental problem.

02:03:36.809 --> 02:03:39.245
And so my question and I think

02:03:39.311 --> 02:03:42.948
that the students actually went

02:03:43.015 --> 02:03:43.482
to some way towards some

02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:44.917
proposals that might do what

02:03:44.984 --> 02:03:47.486
I'm talking about. My question

02:03:47.553 --> 02:03:54.894
for you was. How how do we go

02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:55.361
beyond a declaration a

02:03:55.427 --> 02:03:58.931
proclamation and make it real

02:03:58.998 --> 02:04:02.535
in the community to create a

02:04:02.601 --> 02:04:05.237
change in the culture which is

02:04:05.304 --> 02:04:07.039
very order for there to truly

02:04:07.106 --> 02:04:10.876
be compassion and communities.

02:04:10.943 --> 02:04:11.477
Thank you thank you very much

on the analyst and- Diane say

02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:23.689

02:04:23.756 --> 02:04:26.826
a reminder I am definitely

02:04:26.892 --> 02:04:27.459

and growing group. As that's

02:05:55.281 --> 02:05:56.649

02:06:31.650 --> 02:06:34.920
this movement. And it has to

02:06:34.987 --> 02:06:38.857
happen here in California

02:06:38.924 --> 02:06:39.458
regarded as radical but let's

02:06:39.525 --> 02:06:43.028

02:06:43.095 --> 02:06:46.632

all star group of folks are so

committed to the community and

02:07:53.298 --> 02:07:54.867
really exemplifies what we need

02:07:54.933 --> 02:07:57.069
to spread. More I think we're

02:07:57.136 --> 02:07:59.138
very blessed to represent the

02:07:59.204 --> 02:08:01.273
community that we deal we

02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:01.807
certainly have a lot of

02:08:01.874 --> 02:08:02.841
problems but we have a lot of

02:08:02.908 --> 02:08:05.177
compassion as well it does make

02:08:05.244 --> 02:08:08.547
it a bit of a mention. Of but

02:08:08.614 --> 02:08:09.148
what I am trying to with the

02:08:09.214 --> 02:08:11.150
legislating compassion I do

02:08:11.216 --> 02:08:13.419
think a very proud to be a co

02:08:13.485 --> 02:08:15.387
author almost always think that

02:08:15.454 --> 02:08:15.854
you need to state your

02:08:15.921 --> 02:08:17.222
intention because your

02:08:17.289 --> 02:08:19.024
intentions in your thoughts

02:08:19.091 --> 02:08:20.793
leader actions. Well I

02:08:20.859 --> 02:08:23.195
absolutely. Masters like the

02:08:23.262 --> 02:08:24.897
but this Hindu and us kind of

02:08:24.963 --> 02:08:26.632
manifesting itself to

02:08:26.698 --> 02:08:27.299
legislation in some sense but I

02:08:27.366 --> 02:08:29.068
think that each and everyone of

02:08:29.134 --> 02:08:32.671
you in some matter. Reflected

02:08:32.738 --> 02:08:34.807
that right that is the of the

02:08:34.873 --> 02:08:35.441
way you think of when you treat

02:08:35.507 --> 02:08:37.009
others. The way the US your

02:08:37.076 --> 02:08:49.288
spiritual your thoughts- always

02:08:49.354 --> 02:08:52.658
come for your actions anyway.

02:08:52.724 --> 02:08:54.960
This expanded health care to.

02:08:55.027 --> 02:08:56.829
Undocumented the residents

02:08:56.895 --> 02:08:58.664
letter twenty six that is

02:08:58.730 --> 02:08:59.264
legislating compassion. Right

02:08:59.331 --> 02:09:00.966
and that's a very real action.

02:09:01.033 --> 02:09:05.337
Of that goes beyond the words

02:09:05.404 --> 02:09:05.938
there's plenty of things that

02:09:06.004 --> 02:09:08.807
we can do as a what I would.

02:09:08.874 --> 02:09:12.911
Ask in but kind of in my-

02:09:12.978 --> 02:09:18.884
comments- is. Bob as father job

02:09:18.951 --> 02:09:20.819
deferring to an and a couple

02:09:20.886 --> 02:09:23.021
others well- me obstruction to

02:09:23.088 --> 02:09:24.990
locked up in cages we have

02:09:25.057 --> 02:09:25.624
children being away from their

02:09:25.691 --> 02:09:28.827
parents. I that we need to show

02:09:28.894 --> 02:09:31.196
our actions are cash to actions

02:09:31.263 --> 02:09:46.645
of standing up is families. We

02:09:46.712 --> 02:09:48.680
are homelessness as was

02:09:48.747 --> 02:09:49.248
mentioned actuation Fremont

02:09:49.314 --> 02:09:49.815
I've heard the same thing as

02:09:49.882 --> 02:09:50.782
house elves a Cupertino Paul

02:09:50.849 --> 02:09:52.951
to. You know everyone has

02:09:53.018 --> 02:09:54.586
compassion but then when

02:09:54.653 --> 02:09:55.187
there's a when it comes to

02:09:55.254 --> 02:09:55.754
doing something about it in

02:09:55.821 --> 02:09:56.922
your own backyard people show

02:09:56.989 --> 02:09:59.024
up and many of those people are

02:09:59.091 --> 02:10:00.792
in your congregations. On the

02:10:00.859 --> 02:10:01.393
weekends or during the course

02:10:01.460 --> 02:10:03.061
of the week. And so we need to

02:10:03.128 --> 02:10:05.831
do what a better job myself

02:10:05.898 --> 02:10:07.032
absolutely first online

02:10:07.099 --> 02:10:10.936
included- job really articulate

02:10:11.003 --> 02:10:12.771
that. Not just about how we

02:10:12.838 --> 02:10:14.907
pray or who we pray to- but how

02:10:14.973 --> 02:10:16.942
do we actually act upon that

02:10:17.009 --> 02:10:19.011
believe that faith and that

02:10:19.077 --> 02:10:20.712
means standing up for our how.

02:10:20.779 --> 02:10:22.781
How's community as vigorously

02:10:22.848 --> 02:10:26.685
as compassionately as possible-

02:10:26.752 --> 02:10:27.319
are incarcerated and informally

02:10:27.386 --> 02:10:29.254
incarcerated those getting

02:10:29.321 --> 02:10:29.821
released people get worried

02:10:29.888 --> 02:10:30.856
sometimes also be released well

02:10:30.923 --> 02:10:32.791
the best way to make sure. Of

02:10:32.858 --> 02:10:35.427
that- that there's no harm

02:10:35.494 --> 02:10:36.795
because is to embrace them and

02:10:36.862 --> 02:10:38.897
bring them back into the

02:10:38.964 --> 02:10:39.531
community and to love them. And

02:10:39.598 --> 02:10:42.734
I think that. That is what I.

02:10:42.801 --> 02:10:44.937
Lots legislating compassion and

02:10:45.003 --> 02:10:45.404
is also demonstrating

02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:48.740
compassion through our actions

02:10:48.807 --> 02:10:51.143
and I think also you. It's a

02:10:51.210 --> 02:10:53.445
very tough last comment on

02:10:53.512 --> 02:10:54.846
makes a very tough place- to

02:10:54.913 --> 02:10:56.882
live very expensive a lot of

02:10:56.949 --> 02:10:57.516
people working really hard are

02:10:57.583 --> 02:10:59.251
struggling to survive. Some are

02:10:59.318 --> 02:11:00.786
are homeless or very close to

02:11:00.852 --> 02:11:02.888
it- somewhere but clear our

02:11:02.955 --> 02:11:03.455
bathroom summer serving our

02:11:03.522 --> 02:11:07.226
food- and- there are a lot of

02:11:07.292 --> 02:11:08.727
people struggling back right

02:11:08.794 --> 02:11:10.729
now and I see some of the

02:11:10.796 --> 02:11:11.330
teachers reading- wearing red

02:11:11.396 --> 02:11:12.965
is about to teachers striking

02:11:13.031 --> 02:11:15.033
and- school workers striking

02:11:15.100 --> 02:11:17.169
in. Chicago and I just wanna

02:11:17.236 --> 02:11:19.071
make mention of the workers in

02:11:19.137 --> 02:11:20.872
the plot the workers again I

02:11:20.939 --> 02:11:23.108
think that we must do you can

02:11:23.175 --> 02:11:24.943
up left everyone. Especially

02:11:25.010 --> 02:11:27.212
those are struggling to make

02:11:27.279 --> 02:11:29.147
ends meet and ends up. As we

02:11:29.214 --> 02:11:32.884
beat. Up were as the feet of

02:11:32.951 --> 02:11:34.886
the homeless and on housing

02:11:34.953 --> 02:11:36.755
that's and ways to by the way

02:11:36.822 --> 02:11:37.389
to put them as well. As as well

02:11:37.456 --> 02:11:39.057
as that physical nourishment

02:11:39.124 --> 02:11:40.792
the spiritual nourishment and

02:11:40.859 --> 02:11:52.904
that activism that of that- all

02:11:52.971 --> 02:11:58.677
of our face the can down.

02:11:58.744 --> 02:11:59.311
Straight through action and so

02:11:59.378 --> 02:12:01.079
on this very hopeful being

02:12:01.146 --> 02:12:03.015
here- in and not just hearing

02:12:03.081 --> 02:12:03.548
to live for the folks the

02:12:03.615 --> 02:12:04.883
audience but- our panelists and

02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:05.417
so I think that. Plenty of

02:12:05.484 --> 02:12:06.918
cause of action. That that we

02:12:06.985 --> 02:12:08.620
can take up. And I know that

02:12:08.687 --> 02:12:09.121
there's nothing we can't

02:12:09.187 --> 02:12:11.023
achieve of fighting all that.

02:12:11.089 --> 02:12:11.623
The hatred and bullying and

02:12:11.690 --> 02:12:12.858
bigotry fighting it with the

02:12:12.924 --> 02:12:14.426
love that I see a is

02:12:14.493 --> 02:12:16.895
unstoppable and so I want to

02:12:16.962 --> 02:12:17.496
thank all of you. Right thank

02:12:17.562 --> 02:12:19.164
you all. And large. Thank you

02:12:19.231 --> 02:12:20.999
symbol member for a hosting

02:12:21.066 --> 02:12:21.600
this important discussion and

02:12:21.667 --> 02:12:23.068
also they can assembly member

02:12:23.135 --> 02:12:23.635
Kalra for signing on this-

02:12:23.702 --> 02:12:24.236
resolution. A special thanks

02:12:24.303 --> 02:12:24.870
all the panelists everybody who

02:12:24.936 --> 02:12:26.805
came out today. It was

02:12:26.872 --> 02:12:27.439
interesting that almost all of

02:12:27.506 --> 02:12:29.107
used almost very similar if you

02:12:29.174 --> 02:12:31.343
look at the key principles. And

02:12:31.410 --> 02:12:32.878
again goes back to the golden

02:12:32.944 --> 02:12:33.512
rule you know treat others the

02:12:33.578 --> 02:12:36.815
way you want to be treated. And

02:12:36.882 --> 02:12:38.850
so I felt that- you know what

02:12:38.917 --> 02:12:39.518
you like this is a greater than

02:12:39.584 --> 02:12:41.053
what divide this and we are the

02:12:41.119 --> 02:12:43.288
human race and- we have so much

02:12:43.355 --> 02:12:46.692
to- in common- the speaker

02:12:46.758 --> 02:12:47.259
mention about compassionate

02:12:47.326 --> 02:12:49.661
Fremont. I was a great charter

02:12:49.728 --> 02:12:51.063
and everybody bought it to it

02:12:51.129 --> 02:12:52.764
until it can be implementing

02:12:52.831 --> 02:12:55.033
it. And to live out the can.

02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:57.002
Values when we had the home

02:12:57.069 --> 02:12:58.804
navigate to center. We had a

02:12:58.870 --> 02:12:59.471
lot of ugliness that came out.

02:12:59.538 --> 02:13:02.808
And I made a quote that you

02:13:02.874 --> 02:13:03.375
know everybody wants to help

02:13:03.442 --> 02:13:03.975
the homeless but just on doing

02:13:04.042 --> 02:13:05.277
your me. And so we have to live

02:13:05.344 --> 02:13:08.747
those principles and so in

02:13:08.814 --> 02:13:09.247
Fremont we did end up-

02:13:09.314 --> 02:13:15.220
unanimously. Voting for that.

02:13:15.287 --> 02:13:20.859
Hello yes thank you. Although I

02:13:20.926 --> 02:13:21.426
like to say we use one what

02:13:21.493 --> 02:13:22.728
political lives on that. And so

02:13:22.794 --> 02:13:25.063
now it's up to us to prove that

02:13:25.130 --> 02:13:25.697
this will six will concept and

02:13:25.764 --> 02:13:26.865
to make sure that we are the

02:13:26.932 --> 02:13:27.432
trust of the community. And

02:13:27.499 --> 02:13:27.966
hopefully with time the

02:13:28.033 --> 02:13:29.401
committee will come to see it-

02:13:29.468 --> 02:13:30.869
we had fights like this

02:13:30.936 --> 02:13:33.105
previously I when it came to

02:13:33.171 --> 02:13:33.705
four wheel housing it was the

02:13:33.772 --> 02:13:35.207
same thing people audit fought

02:13:35.273 --> 02:13:36.842
it. And then now the champion

02:13:36.908 --> 02:13:37.409
it so I think the same will

02:13:37.476 --> 02:13:39.211
happen with these. Centers so

02:13:39.277 --> 02:13:41.213
I'm hopeful that we can all

02:13:41.279 --> 02:13:42.881
come together- it you know for

02:13:42.948 --> 02:13:45.016
the greater good. And that

02:13:45.083 --> 02:13:47.018
support this effort that up

02:13:47.085 --> 02:13:47.619
symbol members leading I think

02:13:47.686 --> 02:13:48.954
this is the right thing and I

02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:52.724
think California is compassion

02:13:52.791 --> 02:13:53.325
state and we need to make sure

02:13:53.392 --> 02:13:53.892
to let everybody know that.

02:13:53.959 --> 02:14:00.932
Thank you. All right. Your to

02:14:00.999 --> 02:14:01.566
five final word down trying to

02:14:01.633 --> 02:14:03.068
see if the community of

02:14:03.135 --> 02:14:05.137
Milpitas could speak if we

02:14:05.203 --> 02:14:05.737
could get a little support if

02:14:05.804 --> 02:14:06.605
you have access to the internet.

02:14:06.671 --> 02:14:20.919
On the laptop. Superintendent

02:14:20.986 --> 02:14:30.595
is helping her bill. You have a

02:14:30.662 --> 02:14:32.964
slide show the little too many

02:14:33.031 --> 02:14:33.532
the element of the deal all

02:14:33.598 --> 02:14:39.070
right. Some abusing for just to

02:14:39.137 --> 02:14:43.008
briefly- fill the time Milpitas

02:14:43.074 --> 02:14:43.575
unified school district has

02:14:43.642 --> 02:14:44.709
approximately ten thousand.

02:14:44.776 --> 02:14:47.012
Three hundred students were K.

02:14:47.078 --> 02:14:48.814
twelve school district we have

02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:49.347
one school ten elementary

02:14:49.414 --> 02:14:51.116
schools two middle schools an

02:14:51.183 --> 02:14:55.153
adult- high school adult-

02:14:55.220 --> 02:14:55.754
learning center and we also

02:14:55.821 --> 02:14:59.090
provide our academic services

02:14:59.157 --> 02:15:01.059
to Elmwood- in the community of

02:15:01.126 --> 02:15:02.894
Milpitas unified school

02:15:02.961 --> 02:15:04.629
district's looks very much like

02:15:04.696 --> 02:15:07.199
this room. And if you ever get

02:15:07.265 --> 02:15:08.967
a chance to visit- our website

02:15:09.034 --> 02:15:10.635
right on the front are moniker

02:15:10.702 --> 02:15:12.771
is culture of we- and the

02:15:12.838 --> 02:15:15.307
culture we that describe to. Is

02:15:15.373 --> 02:15:18.910
chest of has just resonated

02:15:18.977 --> 02:15:19.544
with a number of things that

02:15:19.611 --> 02:15:21.079
I've heard in this room we take

02:15:21.146 --> 02:15:23.048
the approach that we have a

02:15:23.114 --> 02:15:24.749
number of different religions.

02:15:24.816 --> 02:15:25.417
Different we have a number of

02:15:25.484 --> 02:15:26.952
different- ethnicities

02:15:27.018 --> 02:15:30.856
diversity languages and that in

02:15:30.922 --> 02:15:31.523
order for us to be able to get

02:15:31.590 --> 02:15:35.126
along. Not only the get along

02:15:35.193 --> 02:15:37.028
with to thrive even in a

02:15:37.095 --> 02:15:40.966
capitalistic. ID that have the

02:15:41.032 --> 02:15:42.801
bill this compassionate- within

02:15:42.868 --> 02:15:43.435
our students as they go through

02:15:43.502 --> 02:15:45.170
their educational journey

02:15:45.237 --> 02:15:45.737
because there are a lot of

02:15:45.804 --> 02:15:46.371
things that they're receiving.

02:15:46.438 --> 02:15:46.972
I think that they're dealing

02:15:47.038 --> 02:15:48.773
with and social media so we've

02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:50.976
ascribed to in the previous

02:15:51.042 --> 02:15:52.844
unified school district we call

02:15:52.911 --> 02:15:53.378
of the culture we and I'm

02:15:53.445 --> 02:15:56.915
hopeful- that we can show that

02:15:56.982 --> 02:15:58.783
brief two minute video that we-

02:15:58.850 --> 02:16:01.319
we shared. With our teachers.

02:16:01.386 --> 02:16:03.321
Arm looks like it's going to

02:16:03.388 --> 02:16:20.839
happen. Yeah yeah yeah. I
