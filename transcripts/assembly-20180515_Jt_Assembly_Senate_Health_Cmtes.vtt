SOME.

00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:27.372 region:rollup2
ESRD PATIENTS HAVE PRIVATE

HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE THIS

00:33:27.372 --> 00:33:30.075 region:rollup2
COULD BE THROUGH AN EMPLOYER

A COMMON BENEFIT IN IS IS IN

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:53.798 region:rollup2
FACT AN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT

00:33:49.895 --> 00:33:54.799 region:rollup2
UNDER UNDERSTATE STATE LAW.

00:33:53.798 --> 00:33:56.334 region:rollup2
I'M ONE.

.

00:33:56.334 --> 00:33:59.905 region:rollup2
NEW ONES THAT WILL BECOME MORE

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:02.307 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT LATER ON IS THAT IN

00:33:59.905 --> 00:34:04.109 region:rollup2
SOME CASES HAVE GOVERNMENT.

00:34:02.307 --> 00:34:05.810 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

HEALTH BENEFITS SO AN EXAMPLE OF

00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:11.950 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD BE. AND STATE

COVERAGE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES.

00:34:13.718 --> 00:34:17.422 region:rollup2
I'M THROUGH CALPERS FOR EXAMPLE

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:18.590 region:rollup2
WILL CONTRACT WITH PRIVATE

PROVIDE COVERAGE.

00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:28.934 region:rollup2
IT'S ON THOSE CASES IT'S A

PROGRAM.

00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:38.577 region:rollup2
NEXT WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT

00:34:36.875 --> 00:34:39.544 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES IN RATES

00:34:38.577 --> 00:34:39.811 region:rollup2
THAT ARE PAID FOR DIALYSIS

00:34:39.544 --> 00:34:41.913 region:rollup2
TREATMENT.

00:34:39.811 --> 00:34:43.481 region:rollup2
.

00:34:41.913 --> 00:34:43.748 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS LIKE

00:34:43.481 --> 00:34:45.684 region:rollup2
MEDICARE.

00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:47.619 region:rollup2
.

00:34:45.684 --> 00:34:48.186 region:rollup2
IN MOST CASES PAY A FIXED RATE

00:34:47.619 --> 00:34:49.354 region:rollup2
THAT'S ESTABLISHED THROUGH.

00:34:48.186 --> 00:34:51.423 region:rollup2
.

00:34:49.354 --> 00:34:53.892 region:rollup2
REGULATION AND IN THE CASE OF

00:34:51.423 --> 00:34:55.760 region:rollup2
MEDICARE RATES HARM ON AVERAGE

00:34:53.892 --> 00:34:57.495 region:rollup2
ONLY SLIGHTLY EXCEED THE AVERAGE

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.763 region:rollup2
COST OF TREATMENT.

00:34:57.495 --> 00:35:00.265 region:rollup2
MEDICARE RATES ARE DIFFICULT TO

00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:01.933 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY COMPARE WITH MEDICARE

00:35:00.265 --> 00:35:03.068 region:rollup2
RATES BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS

00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:05.370 region:rollup2
THAT THEY. TYPICALLY ARE ARE

00:35:03.068 --> 00:35:07.939 region:rollup2
LOWER.

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:09.507 region:rollup2
PRIVATE INSURERS AND SPEAKING

00:35:07.939 --> 00:35:10.809 region:rollup2
AGAIN ABOUT EMPLOYER SPONSORED

00:35:09.507 --> 00:35:12.243 region:rollup2
PLANS OR OR INDIVIDUAL MARKET

00:35:10.809 --> 00:35:13.578 region:rollup2
COVERAGE.

00:35:12.243 --> 00:35:15.280 region:rollup2
AND THEY NEGOTIATE WITH PAYERS

00:35:13.578 --> 00:35:16.147 region:rollup2
TO.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.383 region:rollup2
ARRIVE AT A RATE THAT THEY'LL

00:35:16.147 --> 00:35:19.851 region:rollup2
PAY AND THESE RATES ARE

00:35:18.383 --> 00:35:22.354 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY DETERMINED BY THE

00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:24.089 region:rollup2
RELATIVE BARGAINING. POSITION OF

00:35:22.354 --> 00:35:26.925 region:rollup2
THE INSURERS AND THE PROVIDERS.

00:35:24.089 --> 00:35:28.526 region:rollup2
AND ON AVERAGE INSURERS AND PAY

00:35:26.925 --> 00:35:30.562 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE TIMES WHAT GOVERNMENT

00:35:28.526 --> 00:35:34.933 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS PAY. FOR OUT PATIENT

00:35:30.562 --> 00:35:36.468 region:rollup2
DATA SERVICES.

00:35:34.933 --> 00:35:38.169 region:rollup2
NOW DESCRIBED THE MAIN

00:35:36.468 --> 00:35:40.605 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS OF THE INITIATIVE

00:35:38.169 --> 00:35:43.508 region:rollup2
BEGINNING ON PAGE FIVE.

00:35:40.605 --> 00:35:45.210 region:rollup2
THE. MAIN PROVISION REQUIRES

00:35:43.508 --> 00:35:48.413 region:rollup2
CHRONIC DIALYSIS CLINICS TO PAY

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:50.015 region:rollup2
REBATES TO CERTAIN PAYERS.

00:35:48.413 --> 00:35:51.416 region:rollup2
WHEN THE CLINICS REVENUES EXCEED

00:35:50.015 --> 00:35:52.884 region:rollup2
A CAP THAT'S EQUAL TO A HUNDRED

00:35:51.416 --> 00:35:55.020 region:rollup2
AND FIFTEEN PERCENT.

00:35:52.884 --> 00:35:57.355 region:rollup2
CERTAIN SPECIFIED COSTS.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:59.157 region:rollup2
THOSE COSTS INCLUDE AND DIRECT

00:35:57.355 --> 00:36:02.160 region:rollup2
PATIENT CARE SERVICES COST AND

00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:02.560 region:rollup2
QUALITY IMPROVEMENT COSTS.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.396 region:rollup2
SO AS AN EXAMPLE.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:06.064 region:rollup2
.

00:36:04.396 --> 00:36:07.198 region:rollup2
A CLINIC WOULD BRING IN A

00:36:06.064 --> 00:36:07.766 region:rollup2
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF REVENUE IN A

00:36:07.198 --> 00:36:09.300 region:rollup2
CLINIC WITH SPEND A CERTAIN

00:36:07.766 --> 00:36:10.835 region:rollup2
AMOUNT ON CALL ON ON TREATMENT

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.237 region:rollup2
AND OTHER EXPENSES IN THE

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:13.772 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO.

00:36:12.237 --> 00:36:15.607 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THE PROFIT TO THE

00:36:13.772 --> 00:36:17.008 region:rollup2
CLINIC

00:36:15.607 --> 00:36:19.144 region:rollup2
AND TWO IT'S.

00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:20.712 region:rollup2
COMPANY THAT IT BELONGS TO IF

00:36:19.144 --> 00:36:22.213 region:rollup2
IT IF IT DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE. A

00:36:20.712 --> 00:36:23.882 region:rollup2
LARGER CHAIN OF OF CLINICS.

00:36:22.213 --> 00:36:25.216 region:rollup2
AND THIS MEASURE WOULD MEASURE

00:36:23.882 --> 00:36:27.452 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD IDENTIFY CERTAIN

00:36:25.216 --> 00:36:28.086 region:rollup2
COSTS AND CAP REVENUES THAT

00:36:27.452 --> 00:36:29.654 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THOSE

00:36:28.086 --> 00:36:31.556 region:rollup2
COSTS.

00:36:29.654 --> 00:36:32.524 region:rollup2
AND IF THE TOTAL REVENUES TO A

00:36:31.556 --> 00:36:35.360 region:rollup2
CLINIC EXCEED THAT REBATES MUST

00:36:32.524 --> 00:36:36.628 region:rollup2
BE PAID.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.997 region:rollup2
THE MEASURE REQUIRES THAT THESE

00:36:36.628 --> 00:36:40.865 region:rollup2
REBATE SPEAK CALCULATED AT THE.

00:36:38.997 --> 00:36:42.767 region:rollup2
WHAT IS WAS REFERRED TO AS A

00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:44.769 region:rollup2
GOVERNING AND ANY LEVEL?

00:36:42.767 --> 00:36:46.638 region:rollup2
WHICH REFERS TO THE ENTITY THAT

00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:47.906 region:rollup2
OWNS OR OPERATES THE CLINIC SO

00:36:46.638 --> 00:36:49.641 region:rollup2
IT WOULD NOT BE A CLINIC BY

00:36:47.906 --> 00:36:50.642 region:rollup2
CLINIC CALCULATION IT WOULD BE

00:36:49.641 --> 00:36:52.711 region:rollup2
AT A HIGHER.

00:36:50.642 --> 00:36:54.279 region:rollup2
SORT OF CORPORATE LEVEL.

00:36:52.711 --> 00:36:55.447 region:rollup2
AND AND THE MEASURE PROVIDES

00:36:54.279 --> 00:37:01.319 region:rollup2
THAT THE REBATES WOULD ONLY BE

00:36:55.447 --> 00:37:02.554 region:rollup2
PAID TO. NON GOVERNMENT PAYERS.

00:37:01.319 --> 00:37:03.455 region:rollup2
ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT PROVISION OF

00:37:02.554 --> 00:37:05.123 region:rollup2
THE INITIATIVE IS THAT.

00:37:03.455 --> 00:37:07.158 region:rollup2
.

00:37:05.123 --> 00:37:09.060 region:rollup2
THE MEASURE ENVISIONS THAT A CDC

00:37:07.158 --> 00:37:11.262 region:rollup2
OR A GOVERNING AND IN THE MIGHT

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:12.230 region:rollup2
AT SOME POINT CHALLENGE THE

00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:13.698 region:rollup2
MEASURE ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:16.034 region:rollup2
UNCONSTITUTIONALLY.

00:37:13.698 --> 00:37:18.269 region:rollup2
IS IT IS THE TAKING OF PRIVATE

00:37:16.034 --> 00:37:20.105 region:rollup2
PROPERTY WITHOUT DUE PROCESS.

00:37:18.269 --> 00:37:21.406 region:rollup2
OR JUST COMPENSATION.

00:37:20.105 --> 00:37:23.108 region:rollup2
THE MEASURE REQUIRES THAT IF

00:37:21.406 --> 00:37:24.142 region:rollup2
SUCH A CHALLENGE IS SUCCESSFUL

00:37:23.108 --> 00:37:25.343 region:rollup2
AT THE CLINIC CAN DEMONSTRATE

00:37:24.142 --> 00:37:26.911 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:29.147 region:rollup2
TAKING.

00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:31.649 region:rollup2
THAT THE REVENUE CAPS STILL

00:37:29.147 --> 00:37:33.518 region:rollup2
APPLIES EXCEPT THAT THE NUMBER

00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:35.220 region:rollup2
ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN IS

00:37:33.518 --> 00:37:36.221 region:rollup2
REPLACED WITH A HIGHER NUMBER.

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.422 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD ALLOW A GREATER

00:37:36.221 --> 00:37:39.290 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF REVENUES TO BE CAPPED.

00:37:37.422 --> 00:37:41.092 region:rollup2
.

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:43.661 region:rollup2
SO THAT IT IS NO LONGER ON AN

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:46.097 region:rollup2
UNCONSTITUTIONAL TAKING AND THE

00:37:43.661 --> 00:37:48.399 region:rollup2
BURDEN IS ON THE CLINIC.

00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:50.335 region:rollup2
TO SUPPLY THAT. THAT ALTERNATIVE

00:37:48.399 --> 00:37:51.302 region:rollup2
NUMBER THAT WOULD BE JUST ENOUGH

00:37:50.335 --> 00:37:54.672 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW IT TO NOT BE AN

00:37:51.302 --> 00:37:56.074 region:rollup2
UNCONSTITUTIONAL TAKING.

00:37:54.672 --> 00:37:58.543 region:rollup2
FINALLY THE MEASURE.

00:37:56.074 --> 00:38:00.478 region:rollup2
REQUIRES GOVERNING ENTITIES TO

00:37:58.543 --> 00:38:01.646 region:rollup2
SUBMIT VARIOUS INFORMATION TO

00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:02.914 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:03.982 region:rollup2
EACH YEAR.

00:38:02.914 --> 00:38:05.750 region:rollup2
RELATED TO THE REBATE

00:38:03.982 --> 00:38:06.551 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS THINGS LIKE THE

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:07.819 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF TREATMENTS PROVIDED

00:38:06.551 --> 00:38:09.721 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF REVENUES THAT ARE

00:38:07.819 --> 00:38:09.988 region:rollup2
BROUGHT AND THE AMOUNT OF COSTS.

00:38:09.721 --> 00:38:12.056 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

00:38:09.988 --> 00:38:13.024 region:rollup2
.

00:38:12.056 --> 00:38:13.825 region:rollup2
I COUNTED TOWARDS DETERMINING

00:38:13.024 --> 00:38:17.095 region:rollup2
THE CAP AND THE AMOUNT OF

00:38:13.825 --> 00:38:18.563 region:rollup2
REBATES THAT ARE PAID.

00:38:17.095 --> 00:38:19.664 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF

00:38:18.563 --> 00:38:21.566 region:rollup2
THE INITIATIVE ON NOW TALK A

00:38:19.664 --> 00:38:24.435 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THE MEASURES

00:38:21.566 --> 00:38:25.370 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON CLINICS AND

00:38:24.435 --> 00:38:27.539 region:rollup2
ON STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:30.809 region:rollup2
FINANCES.

00:38:27.539 --> 00:38:31.309 region:rollup2
.

00:38:30.809 --> 00:38:34.345 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT PAGE SEVEN.

00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:36.514 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT.

00:38:34.345 --> 00:38:39.617 region:rollup2
CHRONIC DIALYSIS CLINIC REVENUES

00:38:36.514 --> 00:38:40.652 region:rollup2
AND IN MOST CASES EXCEED THE CAP

00:38:39.617 --> 00:38:42.353 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE PUT IN PLACE BY

00:38:40.652 --> 00:38:44.322 region:rollup2
THIS MEASURE.

00:38:42.353 --> 00:38:45.990 region:rollup2
AND THAT IF CLINICS DID NOT

00:38:44.322 --> 00:38:46.791 region:rollup2
CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR IN ANYWAY

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:48.660 region:rollup2
AND CONTINUED OPERATING AS THEY

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:51.229 region:rollup2
DO NOW.

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:53.198 region:rollup2
REBATES WOULD BE REQUIRED.

00:38:51.229 --> 00:38:55.533 region:rollup2
LIKELY IN IN THE HUNDREDS OF

00:38:53.198 --> 00:38:56.935 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

00:38:55.533 --> 00:38:59.103 region:rollup2
I AM HOWEVER THE PRECISE AMOUNT

00:38:56.935 --> 00:39:01.806 region:rollup2
OF THE REBATES AND THE IMPACT ON

00:38:59.103 --> 00:39:03.841 region:rollup2
CLINICS IS UNCERTAIN FOR A FEW.

00:39:01.806 --> 00:39:05.043 region:rollup2
A FEW REASONS AM. THE AMOUNT OF

00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:06.845 region:rollup2
THE REBATES IS SIGNIFICANT FOR

00:39:05.043 --> 00:39:08.313 region:rollup2
CLINICS BECAUSE A LARGE AMOUNT

00:39:06.845 --> 00:39:09.847 region:rollup2
OF REBATES COULD POTENTIALLY

00:39:08.313 --> 00:39:12.684 region:rollup2
RESULT IN THE CLINIC.

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:14.252 region:rollup2
HAVING NO PROFITS HAVING LOSSES.

00:39:12.684 --> 00:39:15.954 region:rollup2
WHERE IS A SMALLER AMOUNT OF

00:39:14.252 --> 00:39:17.822 region:rollup2
REBATES AND MAY NOT?

00:39:15.954 --> 00:39:19.023 region:rollup2
?

00:39:17.822 --> 00:39:20.625 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF REBATES IS UNCLEAR

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:22.360 region:rollup2
FOR TWO MAIN REASONS NUMBER ONE

00:39:20.625 --> 00:39:24.362 region:rollup2
THERE SEVERAL INSTANCES WHERE.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:26.364 region:rollup2
IT'S I'M UNCLEAR HOW THE MEASURE

00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:28.967 region:rollup2
WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN PRACTICE.

00:39:26.364 --> 00:39:30.068 region:rollup2
AND WHAT ONCE AND YOU ASSUME A

00:39:28.967 --> 00:39:30.568 region:rollup2
CERTAIN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

00:39:30.068 --> 00:39:32.437 region:rollup2
MEASURE IT'S UNCLEAR HOW

00:39:30.568 --> 00:39:35.306 region:rollup2
EXACTLY.

00:39:32.437 --> 00:39:35.907 region:rollup2
THE CHRONIC DIALYSIS CLINICS AND

00:39:35.306 --> 00:39:36.641 region:rollup2
THEIR GOVERNING ENTITIES WILL

00:39:35.907 --> 00:39:37.842 region:rollup2
RESPOND.

00:39:36.641 --> 00:39:39.544 region:rollup2
SO A LOT THROUGH SOME OF THOSE

00:39:37.842 --> 00:39:40.144 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTIES AND TALK ABOUT A

00:39:39.544 --> 00:39:42.347 region:rollup2
RANGE OF POTENTIAL THINGS THAT

00:39:40.144 --> 00:39:44.349 region:rollup2
COULD HAPPEN.

00:39:42.347 --> 00:39:46.084 region:rollup2
ON PAGE EIGHT.

00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:47.819 region:rollup2
THE FIRST SOURCE OF UNCERTAINTY

00:39:46.084 --> 00:39:48.586 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW THE MEASURE WOULD BE

00:39:47.819 --> 00:39:50.355 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED RELATES TO WHICH

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:51.856 region:rollup2
COSTS.

00:39:50.355 --> 00:39:53.791 region:rollup2
WOULD BE INCLUDED WHEN

00:39:51.856 --> 00:39:56.361 region:rollup2
DETERMINING THE REVENUE CAP.

00:39:53.791 --> 00:39:57.295 region:rollup2
.

00:39:56.361 --> 00:39:58.630 region:rollup2
INCLUDING MORE COSTS RESULTS IN

00:39:57.295 --> 00:40:00.398 region:rollup2
HIGHER CAP.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:02.467 region:rollup2
SMALLER REBATES

00:40:00.398 --> 00:40:04.435 region:rollup2
AND RELATIVELY LESS IMPACT ON A

00:40:02.467 --> 00:40:06.404 region:rollup2
CLINICS BOTTOM LINE.

00:40:04.435 --> 00:40:08.106 region:rollup2
INCLUDING HAVE FEWER COSTS

00:40:06.404 --> 00:40:09.440 region:rollup2
RESULTS IN A LOWER CAP HIGHER

00:40:08.106 --> 00:40:10.341 region:rollup2
REBATES AND.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:13.511 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY MORE NEGATIVE IMPACT

00:40:10.341 --> 00:40:15.546 region:rollup2
OF THE CLINIC'S OPERATIONS.

00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:17.315 region:rollup2
AS AN EXAMPLE. THAT WHEN

00:40:15.546 --> 00:40:19.617 region:rollup2
DEFINING DIRECT PATIENT CARE

00:40:17.315 --> 00:40:20.151 region:rollup2
COSTS ONE OF THE MAIN CATEGORIES

00:40:19.617 --> 00:40:22.420 region:rollup2
OF ALLOWABLE COSTS IN THE

00:40:20.151 --> 00:40:24.722 region:rollup2
MEASURE.

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.323 region:rollup2
THE LANGUAGE AT IT

00:40:24.722 --> 00:40:27.058 region:rollup2
SCOOTS COSTS THAT ARE RELATED

00:40:25.323 --> 00:40:29.594 region:rollup2
TO.

00:40:27.058 --> 00:40:31.462 region:rollup2
.

00:40:29.594 --> 00:40:31.996 region:rollup2
BECAUSE CAN ONLY BE INCLUDED IF

00:40:31.462 --> 00:40:33.164 region:rollup2
THEY'RE FOR NON MANAGERIAL

00:40:31.996 --> 00:40:35.166 region:rollup2
STAFF.

00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:36.467 region:rollup2
.

00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:38.269 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THERE ARE A FEW

00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:40.038 region:rollup2
POSITIONS THAT THE FEDERAL

00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:42.140 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT REQUIRES CLINICS TO

00:40:40.038 --> 00:40:43.474 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN. IN ORDER TO GET

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:45.276 region:rollup2
MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT

00:40:43.474 --> 00:40:46.878 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:47.879 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR WHETHER

00:40:46.878 --> 00:40:49.914 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD BE CONSIDERED

00:40:47.879 --> 00:40:51.516 region:rollup2
MANAGERIAL OR NOT AND THESE ARE

00:40:49.914 --> 00:40:53.217 region:rollup2
THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND THE

00:40:51.516 --> 00:40:55.186 region:rollup2
NURSE MANAGER.

00:40:53.217 --> 00:40:56.888 region:rollup2
THEY'RE INVOLVED IN PROVIDING

00:40:55.186 --> 00:40:58.489 region:rollup2
DIRECT PATIENT CARE SO. ONE

00:40:56.888 --> 00:40:59.824 region:rollup2
MIGHT THINK THAT THEY COULD BE

00:40:58.489 --> 00:41:00.792 region:rollup2
INCLUDED AS A DIRECT PATIENT

00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:02.093 region:rollup2
CARE COST BUT ON THE OTHER HAND

00:41:00.792 --> 00:41:04.028 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE.

00:41:02.093 --> 00:41:05.763 region:rollup2
AND RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THAT

00:41:04.028 --> 00:41:07.265 region:rollup2
ARE MANAGERIAL. AND THE

00:41:05.763 --> 00:41:08.1000 region:rollup2
PROPONENTS IN THE OPPONENTS OF

00:41:07.265 --> 00:41:09.834 region:rollup2
THE MEASURE DISAGREE. ABOUT

00:41:08.1000 --> 00:41:11.869 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE COST OF THESE

00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:13.171 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR MANDATORY POSITIONS

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:14.972 region:rollup2
THAT MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND THE

00:41:13.171 --> 00:41:16.407 region:rollup2
NURSE MANAGER.

00:41:14.972 --> 00:41:21.145 region:rollup2
WOULD BE INCLUDED. WHEN

00:41:16.407 --> 00:41:22.647 region:rollup2
DETERMINING THE REVENUE CAPS.

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:24.716 region:rollup2
A SECOND SOURCE OF UNCERTAINTY

00:41:22.647 --> 00:41:26.417 region:rollup2
IS HOW PRIVATE INSURERS THE

00:41:24.716 --> 00:41:28.086 region:rollup2
CONTRACT WITH GOVERNMENT

00:41:26.417 --> 00:41:29.721 region:rollup2
AGENCIES AND GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS

00:41:28.086 --> 00:41:32.156 region:rollup2
WOULD BE TREATED.

00:41:29.721 --> 00:41:34.292 region:rollup2
AS WE NOTED PREVIOUSLY.

00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:35.893 region:rollup2
REBATES CAN ONLY BE PAID TO NON

00:41:34.292 --> 00:41:38.296 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT PAIRS BUT.

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:39.597 region:rollup2
.

00:41:38.296 --> 00:41:41.232 region:rollup2
PRIVATE INSURERS THAT ARE

00:41:39.597 --> 00:41:42.734 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING CARE

00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:44.369 region:rollup2
FOR AN INADVERTENT OF VISUAL

00:41:42.734 --> 00:41:45.803 region:rollup2
PATIENT ON BEHALF OF A

00:41:44.369 --> 00:41:47.772 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT AGENCY.

00:41:45.803 --> 00:41:48.906 region:rollup2
SUCH AS CALPERS.

00:41:47.772 --> 00:41:50.641 region:rollup2
OR ON BEHALF OF THE MEDICARE

00:41:48.906 --> 00:41:52.777 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

00:41:50.641 --> 00:41:53.711 region:rollup2
AND MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED A A

00:41:52.777 --> 00:41:56.247 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT PAYER.

00:41:53.711 --> 00:41:56.981 region:rollup2
.

00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:58.649 region:rollup2
A FINAL

00:41:56.981 --> 00:41:59.917 region:rollup2
POINT OF UNCERTAINTY IS HOW THE

00:41:58.649 --> 00:42:00.952 region:rollup2
LEGAL PROCESS THAT WOULD ALLOW

00:41:59.917 --> 00:42:02.787 region:rollup2
THE CAP TO BE RAISED HOW THAT

00:42:00.952 --> 00:42:04.555 region:rollup2
WOULD WORK IN PRACTICE.

00:42:02.787 --> 00:42:06.024 region:rollup2
OTHER STATE POLICIES THAT

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:08.493 region:rollup2
REGULATE PRICES THAT CAN BE

00:42:06.024 --> 00:42:09.794 region:rollup2
CHARGED FOR GOODS AND SERVICES

00:42:08.493 --> 00:42:11.529 region:rollup2
HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES

00:42:09.794 --> 00:42:12.363 region:rollup2
WHERE THE REGULATED ENTITY CAN

00:42:11.529 --> 00:42:14.365 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATE AND JUSTIFY THEIR

00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:15.466 region:rollup2
COSTS.

00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:16.834 region:rollup2
IN THIS CASE THE MEASURE

00:42:15.466 --> 00:42:18.636 region:rollup2
DEFINES ITS REVENUE CAP BY

00:42:16.834 --> 00:42:20.838 region:rollup2
FORMULA AND ALLOWS ADJUSTMENTS

00:42:18.636 --> 00:42:21.372 region:rollup2
ONLY THROUGH A COURT CHALLENGE.

00:42:20.838 --> 00:42:24.075 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE NOT AWARE OF.

00:42:21.372 --> 00:42:25.710 region:rollup2
A SIMILAR REGULATORY SYSTEM

00:42:24.075 --> 00:42:27.378 region:rollup2
THAT EXISTS TODAY AND AS A

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:28.679 region:rollup2
RESULT IT'S UNCERTAIN HOW THE

00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:30.748 region:rollup2
PROCESS WOULD WORK IN PRACTICE

00:42:28.679 --> 00:42:33.451 region:rollup2
AND WHAT. LEVEL OF.

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:35.853 region:rollup2
REBATES A COURT MIGHT CONSIDER

00:42:33.451 --> 00:42:37.321 region:rollup2
TO BE I'M CREATING AN

00:42:35.853 --> 00:42:38.089 region:rollup2
UNCONSTITUTIONAL TAKING.

00:42:37.321 --> 00:42:39.557 region:rollup2
I'M IN THE CASE OF ANY

00:42:38.089 --> 00:42:44.495 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR CLINIC OR GOVERNING

00:42:39.557 --> 00:42:46.731 region:rollup2
ENTITY.

00:42:44.495 --> 00:42:47.799 region:rollup2
ON PAGE TEN WE WALK THROUGH SOME

00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:48.599 region:rollup2
OF THE POTENTIAL CLINIC

00:42:47.799 --> 00:42:51.803 region:rollup2
RESPONSES.

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:53.237 region:rollup2
GIVEN ANY AND INTERPRETATION OF

00:42:51.803 --> 00:42:55.206 region:rollup2
OF HOW THE MEASURE WOULD BE

00:42:53.237 --> 00:42:57.809 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED.

00:42:55.206 --> 00:42:59.544 region:rollup2
AND CLINICS WILL OF COURSE AND

00:42:57.809 --> 00:43:00.645 region:rollup2
LIKELY TAKE ACTION TO MINIMIZE

00:42:59.544 --> 00:43:02.346 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF REBATES THAT THEY

00:43:00.645 --> 00:43:03.948 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO PAY SO'S TO.

00:43:02.346 --> 00:43:06.584 region:rollup2
CONTINUE THEIR OPERATIONS.

00:43:03.948 --> 00:43:08.419 region:rollup2
.

00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:10.555 region:rollup2
THERE A FEW POSSIBLE RESPONSES

00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:12.056 region:rollup2
THAT COULD COME ABOUT TO ACHIEVE

00:43:10.555 --> 00:43:12.557 region:rollup2
THIS NUMBER ONE THE CLINICS

00:43:12.056 --> 00:43:13.124 region:rollup2
COULD MODIFY THEIR COST

00:43:12.557 --> 00:43:14.692 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES.

00:43:13.124 --> 00:43:16.461 region:rollup2
AND.

00:43:14.692 --> 00:43:18.529 region:rollup2
IF A CLINIC.

00:43:16.461 --> 00:43:20.531 region:rollup2
REDUCES COSTS THAT ARE NOT

00:43:18.529 --> 00:43:21.099 region:rollup2
COUNTED TOWARDS REVENUE CAP THEY

00:43:20.531 --> 00:43:22.333 region:rollup2
CAN KEEP THE SAME AMOUNT OF

00:43:21.099 --> 00:43:24.001 region:rollup2
REVENUE.

00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:25.203 region:rollup2
BUT THOSE REVENUES ARE NOTED

00:43:24.001 --> 00:43:27.104 region:rollup2
AGAINST A SMALLER AMOUNT OF

00:43:25.203 --> 00:43:29.240 region:rollup2
COSTS RESULTING IN.

00:43:27.104 --> 00:43:31.275 region:rollup2
MORE MORE PROFIT.

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:32.844 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVELY A CLINIC MAY HAVE

00:43:31.275 --> 00:43:35.146 region:rollup2
LESS INCENTIVE TO.

00:43:32.844 --> 00:43:37.348 region:rollup2
LIMIT COSTS THAT DO COUNT

00:43:35.146 --> 00:43:38.916 region:rollup2
TOWARDS THE CAP SINCE.

00:43:37.348 --> 00:43:40.885 region:rollup2
HAVING ADDITIONAL COSTS AND

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:43.154 region:rollup2
ALLOWS REVENUES TO RISE.

00:43:40.885 --> 00:43:44.789 region:rollup2
AND ORDINARILY I HAVE A COMPANY

00:43:43.154 --> 00:43:46.257 region:rollup2
WOULD TRY AND LIMIT ITS COSTS.

00:43:44.789 --> 00:43:47.525 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF REVENUES BUT

00:43:46.257 --> 00:43:48.860 region:rollup2
IN THIS CASE INCREASING YOUR

00:43:47.525 --> 00:43:49.427 region:rollup2
COSTS ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE GREATER

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.963 region:rollup2
REVENUES THAN YOU WOULD HAVE

00:43:49.427 --> 00:43:53.598 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE.

00:43:51.963 --> 00:43:54.699 region:rollup2
IN SOME CASES HAVE CLINICS MAY

00:43:53.598 --> 00:43:56.267 region:rollup2
CHOOSE TO LOWER THE RATES THAT

00:43:54.699 --> 00:43:58.302 region:rollup2
THEY CHARGE.

00:43:56.267 --> 00:43:59.737 region:rollup2
TO PAYERS IN PARTICULAR.

00:43:58.302 --> 00:44:00.638 region:rollup2
PRIVATE INSURANCE

00:43:59.737 --> 00:44:02.907 region:rollup2
SO AS TO AVOID HAVING TO PAY

00:44:00.638 --> 00:44:03.774 region:rollup2
REBATES.

00:44:02.907 --> 00:44:06.110 region:rollup2
AND IF.

00:44:03.774 --> 00:44:07.011 region:rollup2
A CLINIC. OR ITS GOVERNING AND

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:08.579 region:rollup2
HE BELIEVES THAT IT CANNOT

00:44:07.011 --> 00:44:10.381 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE A REASONABLE RETURN

00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:10.948 region:rollup2
AFTER MAKING THOSE KINDS OF

00:44:10.381 --> 00:44:11.883 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT SEEK

00:44:10.948 --> 00:44:14.085 region:rollup2
RELIEF.

00:44:11.883 --> 00:44:16.320 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE LEGAL PROCESS AND.

00:44:14.085 --> 00:44:17.421 region:rollup2
IF THESE CHALLENGES PROCEED IS

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.956 region:rollup2
THE MEASURE OUTLINES THEY COULD

00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:20.191 region:rollup2
RECEIVE A HIGHER CAPITAL WHILE

00:44:18.956 --> 00:44:22.093 region:rollup2
THEM TO.

00:44:20.191 --> 00:44:23.361 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE OPERATING THAT WAY.

00:44:22.093 --> 00:44:25.162 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY.

00:44:23.361 --> 00:44:25.830 region:rollup2
IN SOME CASES THAT REDUCED

00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:27.532 region:rollup2
REVENUES UNDER THE REBATE

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:28.866 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS.

00:44:27.532 --> 00:44:30.768 region:rollup2
COULD RESULT IN.

00:44:28.866 --> 00:44:31.736 region:rollup2
CLINICS CLOSING GOVERNING

00:44:30.768 --> 00:44:33.437 region:rollup2
ENTITIES CHOOSING NOT TO OPEN AS

00:44:31.736 --> 00:44:36.140 region:rollup2
MANY CLINICS.

00:44:33.437 --> 00:44:37.608 region:rollup2
IF IF THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH.

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:41.345 region:rollup2
RETURNED TO JUSTIFY THEIR

00:44:37.608 --> 00:44:44.815 region:rollup2
CONTINUING IN THE MARKET.

00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:47.184 region:rollup2
WHICH BEHAVIOR RESPONSE CLINICS

00:44:44.815 --> 00:44:48.486 region:rollup2
CHOOSE TO TAKE HOW WILL DEPEND

00:44:47.184 --> 00:44:49.854 region:rollup2
IN PART ON HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED

00:44:48.486 --> 00:44:51.422 region:rollup2
HOW THE MEASURES IMPLEMENTED IF

00:44:49.854 --> 00:44:53.558 region:rollup2
THE MEASURE IS IMPLEMENTED IN. A

00:44:51.422 --> 00:44:56.527 region:rollup2
BROADER WAY THAT.

00:44:53.558 --> 00:44:58.796 region:rollup2
ALLOWS OF A WIDER RANGE OF

00:44:56.527 --> 00:45:00.298 region:rollup2
COSTS ACCOUNT IN DETERMINING

00:44:58.796 --> 00:45:02.200 region:rollup2
THAT REVENUE CAP.

00:45:00.298 --> 00:45:04.068 region:rollup2
THE MEASURE IS LESS LIKELY TO

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:06.103 region:rollup2
NEGATIVELY IMPACT.

00:45:04.068 --> 00:45:07.338 region:rollup2
CLINICS VIABILITY AND CLINICS

00:45:06.103 --> 00:45:08.639 region:rollup2
ARE MORE LIKELY TO TAKE THE

00:45:07.338 --> 00:45:10.074 region:rollup2
FIRST TWO BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:10.775 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY WILL ADJUST THEIR

00:45:10.074 --> 00:45:12.376 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS TO MITIGATE THE

00:45:10.775 --> 00:45:14.579 region:rollup2
EFFECT.

00:45:12.376 --> 00:45:15.680 region:rollup2
OF OF THE REBATES.

00:45:14.579 --> 00:45:17.215 region:rollup2
ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE MEASURE

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:19.283 region:rollup2
IS IMPLEMENTED WITH A MORE

00:45:17.215 --> 00:45:20.952 region:rollup2
NARROW DEFINITION OF COSTS.

00:45:19.283 --> 00:45:23.020 region:rollup2
AND REVENUE CAPS ARE LOWER

00:45:20.952 --> 00:45:23.988 region:rollup2
REBATES ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT.

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:25.790 region:rollup2
IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT.

00:45:23.988 --> 00:45:27.758 region:rollup2
.

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:29.594 region:rollup2
CLINICS ONGOING OPERATIONS WILL

00:45:27.758 --> 00:45:31.329 region:rollup2
BE WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED

00:45:29.594 --> 00:45:31.963 region:rollup2
AND THEY MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO

00:45:31.329 --> 00:45:33.531 region:rollup2
SEEK ADJUSTMENTS TO THE REVENUE

00:45:31.963 --> 00:45:33.998 region:rollup2
CAP.

00:45:33.531 --> 00:45:38.970 region:rollup2
OR TO SCALE BACK THEIR

00:45:33.998 --> 00:45:41.072 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS.

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:42.773 region:rollup2
TO WRAP THIS ALL UP ON PAGE

00:45:41.072 --> 00:45:45.176 region:rollup2
TWELVE WE TALK ABOUT.

00:45:42.773 --> 00:45:46.143 region:rollup2
AND THE POTENTIAL FISCAL EFFECTS

00:45:45.176 --> 00:45:47.845 region:rollup2
ON STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:45:46.143 --> 00:45:49.247 region:rollup2
FROM THIS MEASURE.

00:45:47.845 --> 00:45:51.349 region:rollup2
I GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY THAT

00:45:49.247 --> 00:45:53.651 region:rollup2
WE'VE DESCRIBED THERE IS A RANGE

00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:55.886 region:rollup2
OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES.

00:45:53.651 --> 00:45:58.356 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN GOING BACK TO A BROAD

00:45:55.886 --> 00:45:59.924 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION OF THE MEASURE IF

00:45:58.356 --> 00:46:01.258 region:rollup2
THE REVENUE CAPS ARE RELATIVELY

00:45:59.924 --> 00:46:02.560 region:rollup2
HIGHER BECAUSE MORE COSTS ARE

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:04.829 region:rollup2
COUNTED.

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:06.063 region:rollup2
AND AND IF CLINICS ARE ABLE TO

00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:07.365 region:rollup2
MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN THEIR

00:46:06.063 --> 00:46:09.867 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS TO.

00:46:07.365 --> 00:46:11.602 region:rollup2
GIVE THEM A SUFFICIENT RETURN

00:46:09.867 --> 00:46:13.337 region:rollup2
TO WANT TO CONTINUE OPERATING.

00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:14.238 region:rollup2
OR THEY'RE ABLE TO ACHIEVE

00:46:13.337 --> 00:46:15.973 region:rollup2
HIGHER REVENUE CAP THROUGH THE

00:46:14.238 --> 00:46:18.442 region:rollup2
COURT PROCESS.

00:46:15.973 --> 00:46:20.278 region:rollup2
AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT CLINICS

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:21.445 region:rollup2
WILL CONTINUE AS THEY DO TODAY.

00:46:20.278 --> 00:46:23.748 region:rollup2
BUT THERE WILL BE LOWER I

00:46:21.445 --> 00:46:26.817 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY LOWER PRICES AND

00:46:23.748 --> 00:46:28.919 region:rollup2
PAID BY PRIVATE INSURERS.

00:46:26.817 --> 00:46:31.055 region:rollup2
IF THAT SCENARIO PLAYS OUT THESE

00:46:28.919 --> 00:46:32.790 region:rollup2
INSURERS MAY PASS ON.

00:46:31.055 --> 00:46:34.759 region:rollup2
A PORTION OF THIS POUND. THAT

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:36.394 region:rollup2
THEY RECEIVE.

00:46:34.759 --> 00:46:39.063 region:rollup2
AND PAYING LOWER RATES TO STATE

00:46:36.394 --> 00:46:41.265 region:rollup2
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.

00:46:39.063 --> 00:46:42.800 region:rollup2
AND THE FORMER REDUCE PREMIUMS.

00:46:41.265 --> 00:46:45.036 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF THESE POTENTIAL

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:47.138 region:rollup2
SAVINGS IS IS UNCERTAIN.

00:46:45.036 --> 00:46:51.676 region:rollup2
BUT COULD BE AS MUCH AS THE ONE

00:46:47.138 --> 00:46:52.743 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY.

00:46:51.676 --> 00:46:54.078 region:rollup2
ON THE OTHER HAND IF THERE IS A

00:46:52.743 --> 00:46:55.513 region:rollup2
MORE NARROW INTERPRETATION OF

00:46:54.078 --> 00:46:59.116 region:rollup2
WHAT COSTS ARE DETERMINED TO BE

00:46:55.513 --> 00:47:00.885 region:rollup2
ALLOWABLE.

00:46:59.116 --> 00:47:02.820 region:rollup2
AND CLINICS. HAVE.

00:47:00.885 --> 00:47:03.020 region:rollup2
ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IN AND

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:04.889 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:05.856 region:rollup2
.

00:47:04.889 --> 00:47:07.391 region:rollup2
IF THE MEASURE NEGATIVELY

00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:08.459 region:rollup2
IMPACTS THE ONGOING VIABILITY OF

00:47:07.391 --> 00:47:10.494 region:rollup2
THE CLINICS.

00:47:08.459 --> 00:47:11.862 region:rollup2
THERE COULD BE FEWER NEW

00:47:10.494 --> 00:47:13.164 region:rollup2
CLINICS OPENING OR SOME CLINICS

00:47:11.862 --> 00:47:15.1000 region:rollup2
CLOSING.

00:47:13.164 --> 00:47:17.668 region:rollup2
WHICH COULD RESULT IN SOME ESRD

00:47:15.1000 --> 00:47:18.736 region:rollup2
PATIENTS RECEIVING DIALYSIS IN

00:47:17.668 --> 00:47:20.438 region:rollup2
NON CLINIC SETTING SUCH AS

00:47:18.736 --> 00:47:20.838 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS.

00:47:20.438 --> 00:47:22.606 region:rollup2
WHICH.

00:47:20.838 --> 00:47:24.275 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE

00:47:22.606 --> 00:47:26.110 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD RESIST RESULT IN

00:47:24.275 --> 00:47:26.277 region:rollup2
STATE COSTS IN MEDICARE HOW.

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:28.379 region:rollup2
AND.

00:47:26.277 --> 00:47:28.913 region:rollup2
.

00:47:28.379 --> 00:47:30.514 region:rollup2
ALSO COSTS FOR STATE LOCAL

00:47:28.913 --> 00:47:32.350 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS.

00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:34.118 region:rollup2
THAT PROVIDE HEALTH BENEFITS TO

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:34.652 region:rollup2
THEIR EMPLOYEES.

00:47:34.118 --> 00:47:36.721 region:rollup2
AND THE AMOUNT OF THESE

00:47:34.652 --> 00:47:40.124 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL COSTS IS UNCERTAIN BUT

00:47:36.721 --> 00:47:41.392 region:rollup2
THEY COULD BE SIGNIFICANT.

00:47:40.124 --> 00:47:43.160 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE MORE SHORT RUN

00:47:41.392 --> 00:47:44.795 region:rollup2
ROTH SHORT RUN EFFECT IN THE

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.863 region:rollup2
LONGER RUN TIME WE EXPECT THE

00:47:44.795 --> 00:47:47.531 region:rollup2
BROADER ADJUSTMENTS IN THE

00:47:45.863 --> 00:47:48.733 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS INDUSTRY.

00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:49.967 region:rollup2
AND POTENTIALLY CHANGES TO HOW

00:47:48.733 --> 00:47:51.335 region:rollup2
THE MEASURE'S PROVISIONS ARE

00:47:49.967 --> 00:47:52.536 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED SUCH AS THROUGH

00:47:51.335 --> 00:47:55.239 region:rollup2
REGULATORY CHANGES.

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:56.474 region:rollup2
JUDICIAL ACTION OR LEGISLATIVE

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:58.109 region:rollup2
ACTION

00:47:56.474 --> 00:47:59.443 region:rollup2
AND WHICH IS ALLOWED TO FOR THE

00:47:58.109 --> 00:48:00.644 region:rollup2
PURPOSES OF THE MEASURE.

00:47:59.443 --> 00:48:02.580 region:rollup2
WOULD TEND TO REDUCE THE HIGHER

00:48:00.644 --> 00:48:04.148 region:rollup2
COSTS OVER TIME.

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:05.483 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE DO NOT ALSO THAT.

00:48:04.148 --> 00:48:07.184 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

00:48:05.483 --> 00:48:09.019 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE INCREASED COSTS.

00:48:07.184 --> 00:48:09.620 region:rollup2
IN THE LOAN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:10.821 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH ADMINISTERING

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:12.089 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:48:10.821 --> 00:48:13.224 region:rollup2
MEASURE THESE WOULD BE COVERED

00:48:12.089 --> 00:48:15.893 region:rollup2
BY INCREASED FEES PAID BY

00:48:13.224 --> 00:48:17.695 region:rollup2
CLINICS.

00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:19.396 region:rollup2
OVERALL BASED ON THE INFORMATION

00:48:17.695 --> 00:48:20.531 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE REVIEWED TO DATE.

00:48:19.396 --> 00:48:22.133 region:rollup2
AND IN LIGHT OF THE SIGNIFICANT

00:48:20.531 --> 00:48:23.567 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW VARIOUS

00:48:22.133 --> 00:48:24.602 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS OF THE MEASURE WOULD

00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:26.203 region:rollup2
BE IMPLEMENTED AND HOW CLINICS

00:48:24.602 --> 00:48:27.505 region:rollup2
WOULD RESPOND.

00:48:26.203 --> 00:48:28.005 region:rollup2
THE NET FISCAL IMPACT ON STATE

00:48:27.505 --> 00:48:30.841 region:rollup2
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IS

00:48:28.005 --> 00:48:32.843 region:rollup2
UNCLEAR.

00:48:30.841 --> 00:48:34.211 region:rollup2
AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR OVERVIEW

00:48:32.843 --> 00:48:34.812 region:rollup2
AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE

00:48:34.211 --> 00:48:38.215 region:rollup2
ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE AT THIS

00:48:34.812 --> 00:48:39.984 region:rollup2
TIME.

00:48:38.215 --> 00:48:44.255 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS FROM THE DICE.

00:48:39.984 --> 00:48:46.490 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS.

00:48:44.255 --> 00:48:47.925 region:rollup2
I DO I DO HAVE I DO HAVE ONE YOU

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:48.959 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT TALK ABOUT A SORT

00:48:47.925 --> 00:48:50.361 region:rollup2
OF A GLOBAL.

00:48:48.959 --> 00:48:51.195 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE.

00:48:50.361 --> 00:48:51.729 region:rollup2
OF.

00:48:51.195 --> 00:48:53.464 region:rollup2
AMOEBA NETWORK.

00:48:51.729 --> 00:48:55.199 region:rollup2
A PROFIT.

00:48:53.464 --> 00:48:57.334 region:rollup2
GLOBAL PROFIT SO IT IT WOULD NOT

00:48:55.199 --> 00:48:58.302 region:rollup2
BE AT NECESSARILY THAT IT'S NOT

00:48:57.334 --> 00:49:00.638 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY THE INDIVIDUAL

00:48:58.302 --> 00:49:02.106 region:rollup2
CLINIC LEVEL IT'S AT THE.

00:49:00.638 --> 00:49:03.374 region:rollup2
PARENT PART OF THE CORRECT IS A

00:49:02.106 --> 00:49:04.441 region:rollup2
DANGER OF THAT.

00:49:03.374 --> 00:49:07.111 region:rollup2
SO IT'S POSSIBLE INDIVIDUAL

00:49:04.441 --> 00:49:09.313 region:rollup2
CLINICS COULD OPERATE AT A LOSS.

00:49:07.111 --> 00:49:11.448 region:rollup2
SO THE IMPACT.

00:49:09.313 --> 00:49:13.050 region:rollup2
TO COMMUNITY COULD.

00:49:11.448 --> 00:49:14.485 region:rollup2
TO ME THAT'S HOW.

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:15.820 region:rollup2
IF YOU GIVE ANY THOUGHT TO HOW

00:49:14.485 --> 00:49:17.121 region:rollup2
HOW THE INDUSTRY MIGHT RESPOND

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:18.656 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE REQUEST ON HOW TO IS

00:49:17.121 --> 00:49:20.090 region:rollup2
HOW THE INDUSTRY RESPOND IF

00:49:18.656 --> 00:49:21.926 region:rollup2
SOMETHING'S INDIVIDUAL CLINICS

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:23.861 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DO OPERATE OUT A LOT.

00:49:21.926 --> 00:49:25.830 region:rollup2
BASED ON THIS NEW FORMULA THAT'S

00:49:23.861 --> 00:49:27.565 region:rollup2
CORRECT AND THE THE REBATES

00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:30.034 region:rollup2
WOULD BE CALCULATED AT THE

00:49:27.565 --> 00:49:31.535 region:rollup2
GOVERNING AND ANY LEVEL AND THAT

00:49:30.034 --> 00:49:32.503 region:rollup2
MEANS THAT WITHIN A GOVERNING

00:49:31.535 --> 00:49:34.004 region:rollup2
AND ANY THERE COULD BE SOME

00:49:32.503 --> 00:49:35.439 region:rollup2
CLINICS THAT DO BETTER THAN

00:49:34.004 --> 00:49:37.074 region:rollup2
OTHERS.

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:39.710 region:rollup2
THE REBATES WOULD BE DETERMINED.

00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:41.278 region:rollup2
ON AGGREGATE AND IN FACT TODAY.

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:42.246 region:rollup2
WITHIN GOVERNING ENTITIES

00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:44.281 region:rollup2
WITHIN THESE.

00:49:42.246 --> 00:49:44.849 region:rollup2
THESE GROUPS OF CLINICS ARE

00:49:44.281 --> 00:49:46.617 region:rollup2
CLINICS TO OPERATE AT A LOSS

00:49:44.849 --> 00:49:48.319 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:49:46.617 --> 00:49:49.486 region:rollup2
AND FOR VARIOUS REASONS IT COULD

00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:51.222 region:rollup2
BE BECAUSE THE CLINIC IS JUST

00:49:49.486 --> 00:49:52.923 region:rollup2
STARTING UP HAS RECEIVED A

00:49:51.222 --> 00:49:54.625 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION TO GET MEDICARE.

00:49:52.923 --> 00:49:55.993 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT AND THINGS LIKE

00:49:54.625 --> 00:49:57.661 region:rollup2
THAT AND THE CLINIC WILL

00:49:55.993 --> 00:49:58.696 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY SUBSIDIZE THAT THE

00:49:57.661 --> 00:50:00.064 region:rollup2
PARENT AND AND ANY WILL

00:49:58.696 --> 00:50:00.531 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIZE THE OPERATIONS OF THAT

00:50:00.064 --> 00:50:02.499 region:rollup2
CLINIC WITH.

00:50:00.531 --> 00:50:03.934 region:rollup2
WITH THE OTHER CLINICS

00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:04.535 region:rollup2
AND SO IN TERMS OF HOW THAT

00:50:03.934 --> 00:50:06.937 region:rollup2
COULD AFFECT.

00:50:04.535 --> 00:50:09.340 region:rollup2
GOVERNING ANY BEHAVIOR.

00:50:06.937 --> 00:50:12.076 region:rollup2
IT IS TRUE THAT IF YOU HAVE

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:12.877 region:rollup2
FOUND.

00:50:12.076 --> 00:50:13.944 region:rollup2
CERTAIN CLINICS IN A GOVERNING

00:50:12.877 --> 00:50:15.613 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU WERE DOING WELL

00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:17.348 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TO SUBSIDIZE OTHERS THAT

00:50:15.613 --> 00:50:19.049 region:rollup2
COULD ALLOW. SOME CLINICS TO

00:50:17.348 --> 00:50:19.283 region:rollup2
CONTINUE OPERATIONS.

00:50:19.049 --> 00:50:20.885 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

00:50:19.283 --> 00:50:22.519 region:rollup2
.

GET TO STAFF MEMBERS ATTENTION

00:53:27.304 --> 00:53:32.342 region:rollup2
THEIR LIVES COULD BE AT RISK.

00:53:30.407 --> 00:53:32.876 region:rollup2
SO WIERD ALICE'S CORPORATION

00:53:32.342 --> 00:53:35.145 region:rollup2
PUTTING PATIENTS LIVES IN

00:53:32.876 --> 00:53:37.147 region:rollup2
DANGER.

00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:38.549 region:rollup2
FOR ONE OF THE WORST.

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:41.151 region:rollup2
AND MOST ON DEFENSIBLE REASONS

00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:42.953 region:rollup2
OF LAW.

00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:44.655 region:rollup2
SO THEY CAN MAKE BILLIONS IN

00:53:42.953 --> 00:53:45.656 region:rollup2
PROFITS HOW PEOPLE HAVE NO

00:53:44.655 --> 00:53:48.559 region:rollup2
CHOICE BUT TO GET THEIR

00:53:45.656 --> 00:53:49.727 region:rollup2
TREATMENT IN THEIR CLINICS.

00:53:48.559 --> 00:53:50.861 region:rollup2
NOW THE DIALYSIS INDUSTRY IN

00:53:49.727 --> 00:53:52.729 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS DOMINATED BY TWO

00:53:50.861 --> 00:53:54.698 region:rollup2
COMPANIES.

00:53:52.729 --> 00:53:56.266 region:rollup2
THE VITA EFFORTS ENNIUS.

00:53:54.698 --> 00:53:57.801 region:rollup2
WHO OWN AND OPERATE SEVENTY TWO

00:53:56.266 --> 00:54:00.037 region:rollup2
PERCENT? OF THE CLINICS AND THIS

00:53:57.801 --> 00:54:01.071 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:54:00.037 --> 00:54:02.940 region:rollup2
THESE COMPANIES ARE MAKING A

00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:04.041 region:rollup2
MASSIVE PROFITS

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:05.442 region:rollup2
THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE SPENT ON

00:54:04.041 --> 00:54:07.811 region:rollup2
THAT TREATING PATIENTS WITH THIS

00:54:05.442 --> 00:54:09.313 region:rollup2
DEADLY DISEASE.

00:54:07.811 --> 00:54:11.148 region:rollup2
THE PROFIT MARGIN OF THEIR

00:54:09.313 --> 00:54:12.783 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS CLINIC IS NEARLY FIVE

00:54:11.148 --> 00:54:15.352 region:rollup2
TIMES HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE

00:54:12.783 --> 00:54:18.322 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:54:15.352 --> 00:54:20.157 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS BIG MONEY.

00:54:18.322 --> 00:54:21.525 region:rollup2
PROFITS UP FROM THEIR U. S.

00:54:20.157 --> 00:54:23.327 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS OPERATIONS TOTALED

00:54:21.525 --> 00:54:25.062 region:rollup2
THREE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS

00:54:23.327 --> 00:54:26.196 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN.

00:54:25.062 --> 00:54:28.966 region:rollup2
THAT'S BILLIONSAND THAT'S WHAT

00:54:26.196 --> 00:54:30.134 region:rollup2
THE BE.

00:54:28.966 --> 00:54:31.668 region:rollup2
NOW MOST CORPORATIONS WOULD

00:54:30.134 --> 00:54:33.971 region:rollup2
CONSIDER FIFTEEN PRINT PERCENT

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:34.938 region:rollup2
PROFIT THAT WE TURN.

00:54:33.971 --> 00:54:36.940 region:rollup2
BUT THESE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN

00:54:34.938 --> 00:54:39.209 region:rollup2
SAYING AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:41.445 region:rollup2
THEY WILL SAY THIS HERE TODAY.

00:54:39.209 --> 00:54:43.380 region:rollup2
THATLIMITING THEM TO A FIFTEEN

00:54:41.445 --> 00:54:44.681 region:rollup2
PERCENT PROFIT MARGIN.

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:46.083 region:rollup2
NOT THAT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:54:44.681 --> 00:54:49.586 region:rollup2
PERCENT MARGIN THAT THEY OFTEN

00:54:46.083 --> 00:54:51.021 region:rollup2
GET FROM PRIVATE INSURANCE.

00:54:49.586 --> 00:54:51.955 region:rollup2
WILL CAUSE THEM TO CLOSE CLINICS

00:54:51.021 --> 00:54:53.924 region:rollup2
AND RESULT IN THE DEATH OF

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:55.359 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

00:54:53.924 --> 00:54:57.461 region:rollup2
NOW THE ONLY REASON THEY WERE

00:54:55.359 --> 00:54:59.863 region:rollup2
CLOSE CLINICS IS BECAUSE THESE

00:54:57.461 --> 00:55:02.566 region:rollup2
CORPORATIONS CHOOSE TO.

00:54:59.863 --> 00:55:05.302 region:rollup2
NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE FORCED TO.

00:55:02.566 --> 00:55:07.404 region:rollup2
TO ME AS A DIALYSIS NURSE FOR

00:55:05.302 --> 00:55:09.439 region:rollup2

THE CLOSE CLINICS AND PUT LIVES

00:55:10.908 --> 00:55:14.311 region:rollup2
AT RISK.

00:55:12.609 --> 00:55:16.580 region:rollup2
S. POSES WHO THESE CORPORATIONS

00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:18.816 region:rollup2
REALLY ARE.

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:22.352 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THEY REALLY CARE ABOUT.

00:55:18.816 --> 00:55:23.587 region:rollup2
AND LET'S BE CLEAR ITS PROFITS.

00:55:22.352 --> 00:55:24.721 region:rollup2
FOR MONTHS THEY HAVE REPEATED

00:55:23.587 --> 00:55:26.757 region:rollup2
OUT LOUD FOR THE WHOLE WORLD TO

00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:28.525 region:rollup2
HEAR.

00:55:26.757 --> 00:55:30.894 region:rollup2
THAT IF THEY CAN'T MAKE THESE UP

00:55:28.525 --> 00:55:32.229 region:rollup2
ST UP PROFITS.

00:55:30.894 --> 00:55:33.764 region:rollup2
BOB THIS TERRIBLE TERMINAL

00:55:32.229 --> 00:55:35.232 region:rollup2
ILLNESS.

00:55:33.764 --> 00:55:38.569 region:rollup2
THEY WILL CLOSE CLINICS

00:55:35.232 --> 00:55:40.504 region:rollup2
AND PEOPLE WILL DIE.

00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:41.672 region:rollup2
THIS INITIATIVE WILL BRING SOME

00:55:40.504 --> 00:55:44.041 region:rollup2
MUCH NEEDED SANITY IMBALANCE TO

00:55:41.672 --> 00:55:45.843 region:rollup2
THIS INDUSTRY.

00:55:44.041 --> 00:55:47.377 region:rollup2
WHICH DESPITE HUGE PROFITS

00:55:45.843 --> 00:55:48.979 region:rollup2

CALIFORNIA'S DESERVE BETTER.

00:55:57.955 --> 00:56:01.091 region:rollup2

GRUELING. BUT IT'S WHAT I HAVE

00:58:56.166 --> 00:58:59.436 region:rollup2
TO DO TO SURVIVE.

00:58:57.934 --> 00:59:01.405 region:rollup2
I SPENT MUCH OF THE OTHER DAYS

00:58:59.436 --> 00:59:03.106 region:rollup2
RECOVERING.

00:59:01.405 --> 00:59:05.876 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS IS AN EXHAUSTING

00:59:03.106 --> 00:59:07.711 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT REMOVES MY BLOOD.

00:59:05.876 --> 00:59:09.312 region:rollup2
CLEANS IT AND RETURNS IT TO MY

00:59:07.711 --> 00:59:11.114 region:rollup2
BODY.

00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:13.050 region:rollup2
EACH SESSION LASTS ABOUT THREE

00:59:11.114 --> 00:59:13.617 region:rollup2
TO FOUR HOURS.

00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:15.452 region:rollup2
I STARTED DIALYSIS IN TWENTY

00:59:13.617 --> 00:59:16.820 region:rollup2
TEN.

00:59:15.452 --> 00:59:18.422 region:rollup2
TWENTY TEN AT A CLINIC IN

00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:20.057 region:rollup2
IRWINDALE.

00:59:18.422 --> 00:59:22.325 region:rollup2
AND OVER THE NEXT SIX YEARS I

00:59:20.057 --> 00:59:23.994 region:rollup2
COMPLAIN MULTIPLE TIMES.

00:59:22.325 --> 00:59:26.263 region:rollup2
ABOUT POOR CONDITIONS BUT LITTLE

00:59:23.994 --> 00:59:28.165 region:rollup2
WAS DONE.

00:59:26.263 --> 00:59:31.168 region:rollup2
DURING FOUR SESSIONS IN TWENTY

00:59:28.165 --> 00:59:33.003 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN I SAW FLIES ENTERED THE

00:59:31.168 --> 00:59:35.672 region:rollup2
FACILITY THROUGH THE DOOR. THE

00:59:33.003 --> 00:59:37.941 region:rollup2
FLIES WOULD HOOK OVER AND LAND

00:59:35.672 --> 00:59:39.309 region:rollup2
ON PATIENTS INCLUDING ME.

00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:40.911 region:rollup2
DURING TREATMENT WE ARE

00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:42.913 region:rollup2
CONNECTED TO TO BEING WHICH MADE

00:59:40.911 --> 00:59:44.948 region:rollup2
IT DIFFICULT TO SHOO THE FLIES

00:59:42.913 --> 00:59:46.950 region:rollup2
AWAY.

00:59:44.948 --> 00:59:48.485 region:rollup2
I ALSO SAW COCKROACHES SCURRYING

00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:49.119 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE FLOOR. THAT CLINIC

00:59:48.485 --> 00:59:51.388 region:rollup2
AND.

00:59:49.119 --> 00:59:54.658 region:rollup2
HAD A.

00:59:51.388 --> 00:59:56.393 region:rollup2
HAD SPIDERS CRAWL UP MY ARMS.

00:59:54.658 --> 00:59:58.862 region:rollup2
CLINIC STAFF.

00:59:56.393 --> 01:00:00.764 region:rollup2
SAID THAT EXTERMINATOR SPRAYED

00:59:58.862 --> 01:00:02.532 region:rollup2
ONCE A MONTH BUT I KEPT SEEN

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:04.367 region:rollup2
THEM AND I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING

01:00:02.532 --> 01:00:05.802 region:rollup2
BECAUSE. I WAS IN A VULNERABLE

01:00:04.367 --> 01:00:08.238 region:rollup2
POSITION HOOKED UP TO A DIALYSIS

01:00:05.802 --> 01:00:09.773 region:rollup2
MACHINE.

01:00:08.238 --> 01:00:11.641 region:rollup2
THE RUSSIANS AT THE CLINIC WORK

01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:13.276 region:rollup2
UNSANITARY.

01:00:11.641 --> 01:00:15.345 region:rollup2
THERE WAS OFTEN YEAR IN ON THE

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:17.714 region:rollup2
TOILETS AND FLOOR.

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:18.448 region:rollup2
WASTE BASKETS WERE OVERFLOWING

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:20.383 region:rollup2
WITH PAPER TOWELS AND OTHER

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:22.185 region:rollup2
TRASH.

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:24.020 region:rollup2
I COMPLAINED AND WAS ASSURED

01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:26.289 region:rollup2
THAT MAINTENANCE CLEAN THE

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:28.325 region:rollup2
RESTROOMS EVERYDAY BUT IT SURE

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:29.659 region:rollup2
DIDN'T LOOK THAT WAY TO ME.

01:00:28.325 --> 01:00:31.094 region:rollup2
BEING TREATED IN THESE

01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:32.295 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS WAS FRIGHTENED

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:33.797 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I CAN EASILY GET AN

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:35.198 region:rollup2
INFECTION.

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:37.367 region:rollup2
FROM WHERE THE TUBING IS

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:39.169 region:rollup2
INSERTED IN MY BODY AND I END UP

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:41.071 region:rollup2
IN THE HOSPITAL.

01:00:39.169 --> 01:00:42.606 region:rollup2
AFTER SIX YEARS I LEFT FOR A

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:44.241 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT CLINIC.

01:00:42.606 --> 01:00:45.876 region:rollup2
I AM GRATEFUL TO BE GONE BUT I

01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:48.411 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT ORINDA CLINIC WAS NOT

01:00:45.876 --> 01:00:50.113 region:rollup2
AN EXCEPTION BASED ON WHAT OTHER

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:51.982 region:rollup2
PATIENTS HAVE TOLD ME.

01:00:50.113 --> 01:00:53.316 region:rollup2
WE DESERVE BETTER AND THAT'S WHY

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:55.385 region:rollup2
I'M SUPPORTING THE FAIR PRICING

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:57.120 region:rollup2
FOR DIALYSIS ACT.

01:00:55.385 --> 01:00:59.289 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:02.425 region:rollup2
BY INVESTING MORE IN STAFF BEING

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:05.695 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES.

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:06.496 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS IS NOT A CHOICE FOR ME.

01:01:05.695 --> 01:01:08.131 region:rollup2
THIS IS A LIFE OR DEATH

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:09.866 region:rollup2
SITUATION.

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:11.434 region:rollup2
AS MUCH AS MY BODY IS IN PAIN

01:01:09.866 --> 01:01:13.336 region:rollup2
FROM DIALYSIS.

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:15.272 region:rollup2
I KEEP GOING BECAUSE MY CHILDREN

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:16.606 region:rollup2
AND MY GRANDKIDS.

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:18.208 region:rollup2
I LOVE SEEING THEM HAPPY AND

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:20.043 region:rollup2
PLAYING TOGETHER AND I'M STAYING

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:21.745 region:rollup2
ALIVE FOR THEM.

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:23.480 region:rollup2
I DON'T BELIEVE THE CORPORATIONS

01:01:21.745 --> 01:01:25.182 region:rollup2
THAT OWN THESE CLINICS CARE

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:27.050 region:rollup2
ABOUT MY LIFE. OR MY STRUGGLE TO

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:28.685 region:rollup2
SURVIVE.

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:30.887 region:rollup2
I DON'T BELIEVE THEY GIVE ME A

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:33.056 region:rollup2
SECOND THOUGHT. TO THEM I AM

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:33.690 region:rollup2
JUST A NUMBER ON A SPREADSHEET

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:35.292 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:36.826 region:rollup2
ME.

01:01:35.292 --> 01:01:38.695 region:rollup2
THIS BAD BALLOT MEASURE WILL

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:40.063 region:rollup2
HELP REVERSE THAT.

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:42.065 region:rollup2
IT MAY NOT MAKE THE PEOPLE WHO

01:01:40.063 --> 01:01:43.366 region:rollup2
PROFIT FROM MY ILLNESS SEEN ME

01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:44.901 region:rollup2
AS A REAL PERSON WITH FEELINGS

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:46.369 region:rollup2
AND THE FAMILY.

01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:46.903 region:rollup2
BUT IT WILL FORCE THEM TO TREAT

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:48.838 region:rollup2
ME AND MY FELLOW PATIENTS

01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:50.707 region:rollup2
BETTER.

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:56.780 region:rollup2
AND FOR NOW THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH

01:01:50.707 --> 01:02:00.517 region:rollup2
FOR ME. THANK YOU.

01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:01.885 region:rollup2
BLOOM.

01:02:00.517 --> 01:02:03.620 region:rollup2
I'M PASSED AWAY EMPTY SMART

I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE AS DOCTOR

KING OFTEN CAME TO SITUATIONS.

01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:29.980 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN INJUSTICE HERE.

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:31.615 region:rollup2
IN FACT DR KING STATED ALL OF

01:02:31.615 --> 01:02:36.553 region:rollup2

I'VE WATCHED AND I'VE LISTEN AND

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:50.233 region:rollup2
I'VE VISITED I'VE SEEN IN MY

PAST STORY.

AND IRAQ'S I'M ONLY FIFTY EIGHT

01:02:55.038 --> 01:02:59.442 region:rollup2
SO I STARTED AT EIGHT YEARS OLD.

01:02:57.741 --> 01:03:01.645 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT JACK AND JUSTICE IN

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:03.713 region:rollup2
FIGHTING FOR PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T

01:03:01.645 --> 01:03:05.482 region:rollup2
FIGHT FOR THEMSELVES.

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:06.583 region:rollup2
YOU WERE HERE TODAY BECAUSE THEY

01:03:05.482 --> 01:03:08.285 region:rollup2
ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T FIGHT FOR

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:09.319 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES.

01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:11.488 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH WE'VE HEARD THE

01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:13.923 region:rollup2
VOICES OF SOME OF THEM TODAY AND

01:03:11.488 --> 01:03:15.292 region:rollup2
THEY'VE GOT SO MANY SIGNATURES.

01:03:13.923 --> 01:03:16.726 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE GOING UP AGAINST A

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:18.561 region:rollup2
GOOD LIE.

01:03:16.726 --> 01:03:20.430 region:rollup2
IN THE INDUSTRY THIS SEEMINGLY

01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:22.198 region:rollup2
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE COMMENT

01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:24.200 region:rollup2

01:03:34.844 --> 01:03:38.848 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:40.583 region:rollup2
THESE PATIENTS GOAL.

01:03:38.848 --> 01:03:42.118 region:rollup2
OF ALL COLORS IN ALL RACES GOAL

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:44.554 region:rollup2
TO UNLOCK.

01:03:42.118 --> 01:03:45.789 region:rollup2
THE GOAL INTO THESE CLINICS.

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:47.624 region:rollup2
PATIENTS ARE THERE BECAUSE

01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:49.859 region:rollup2
THEY'RE VERY SICK.

01:03:47.624 --> 01:03:52.262 region:rollup2
THEY NEEDS TO GET DIALYSIS THREE

01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:53.997 region:rollup2
AND FOUR TIMES A WEEK JUST TO

01:03:52.262 --> 01:03:56.166 region:rollup2
STAY ALIVE.

01:03:53.997 --> 01:03:57.334 region:rollup2
THEIR CONDITIONS

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:59.436 region:rollup2
MAKES THEM PARTICULARLY

01:03:57.334 --> 01:04:01.571 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE SWIM FACTION IN OTHER

01:03:59.436 --> 01:04:03.640 region:rollup2
ILLNESSES.

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:05.575 region:rollup2
THESE CLINICS OR SOME OF THE

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:08.478 region:rollup2
NASTIEST AND DIRTIEST ONES IN

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:11.047 region:rollup2
THE COUNTRY.

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:13.249 region:rollup2
TOO MANY OF THEM FACE SUB

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:15.485 region:rollup2
STANDARD CONDITIONS IN THESE

01:04:13.249 --> 01:04:16.720 region:rollup2
COME TO THESE CLINICS WHEN THEY

01:04:15.485 --> 01:04:18.188 region:rollup2
GO THERE FOR TREATMENT. AS

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:20.290 region:rollup2
YOU'VE HEARD.

01:04:18.188 --> 01:04:23.460 region:rollup2
PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS REPORT

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:25.061 region:rollup2
INSTANCES ABOVE THE BLOODSTAINS

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:26.629 region:rollup2
SO OFTEN THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH

01:04:25.061 --> 01:04:28.465 region:rollup2
STAFF.

01:04:26.629 --> 01:04:31.401 region:rollup2
TO PROPERLY CARE FOR THEM WHEN I

01:04:28.465 --> 01:04:33.803 region:rollup2
TOOK A MEMBER OF MY CHURCH TO A.

01:04:31.401 --> 01:04:36.072 region:rollup2
TO A HOSPITAL'S DIALYSIS THERE

01:04:33.803 --> 01:04:37.807 region:rollup2
WERE TWO PEOPLE WATCHING OVER

01:04:36.072 --> 01:04:39.542 region:rollup2
THEM CONTRA CONSTANTLY I'VE

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:41.978 region:rollup2
HEARD REPORTS IN THESE THAT

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:43.980 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THERE'S ONE PERSON ONE

01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:47.016 region:rollup2
CAREGIVER RESPONSIBLE FOR THREE

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:49.686 region:rollup2
OF FOUR PEOPLE. THAT'S AWFUL.

01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:51.221 region:rollup2
SO OFTEN THAT HAPPENS IMPATIENCE

01:04:49.686 --> 01:04:52.689 region:rollup2
ARE NOT TREATED FAIRLY.

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:54.290 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE HERE BECAUSE AN

01:04:52.689 --> 01:04:55.325 region:rollup2
INJUSTICE IS HERE.

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:56.893 region:rollup2
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE WANT TO

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:58.294 region:rollup2
CHANGE THIS

01:04:56.893 --> 01:05:01.131 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE HOPING TO THE FAIR

01:04:58.294 --> 01:05:02.565 region:rollup2
PRICING FOR DIALYSIS IS THAT.

01:05:01.131 --> 01:05:04.567 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WOULD MAKE A CHANGE A

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:06.503 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT CHAINS

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:08.972 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:11.274 region:rollup2
TO DO IT. BUT THEY DIDN'T DO IT

01:05:08.972 --> 01:05:12.976 region:rollup2
SO NOW WE THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN

01:05:11.274 --> 01:05:15.311 region:rollup2
IN NOVEMBER SIX WE'RE GOING TO

01:05:12.976 --> 01:05:17.547 region:rollup2
PROVE SO THIS INDUSTRY HOW THEY

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:19.449 region:rollup2
MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK

01:05:17.547 --> 01:05:20.750 region:rollup2
TOGETHER WITH US.

01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:22.318 region:rollup2
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THEM

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:25.622 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY PUT MONEY BEFORE

01:05:22.318 --> 01:05:27.757 region:rollup2
MORALITY FINANCES BEFORE FAMILY

01:05:25.622 --> 01:05:29.426 region:rollup2
DARLA'S BEFORE DECENCY PROFIT

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:30.560 region:rollup2
BEFORE PEOPLE EARNINGS BEFORE

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:33.229 region:rollup2
ETHICS

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:34.864 region:rollup2
INCOME BEFORE INDIVIDUALS SO

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:35.765 region:rollup2
WHERE HERE THE DAY THE SAME. WE

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:38.201 region:rollup2
ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS

.

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:21.477 region:rollup2
I THINK WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:22.645 region:rollup2
ALLEY OWES ANNOUNCES SOME

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:24.614 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT.

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:25.782 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW DEFINITIONS AROUND NON

MANAGERIAL CHRONIC.

01:06:25.782 --> 01:06:29.319 region:rollup2
PRODUCT AYE CHRONIC DIALYSIS.

01:06:28.952 --> 01:06:31.387 region:rollup2
A CLINIC STAFF.

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:33.089 region:rollup2
.

01:06:31.387 --> 01:06:33.523 region:rollup2
OUR MEDICAL CONSIDERED A MEDICAL

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:35.358 region:rollup2

UNDERSTAND WHAT THE INTENT IS SO

01:06:38.194 --> 01:06:40.897 region:rollup2
THE INTENT OF THE MEDICAL

01:06:39.229 --> 01:06:43.066 region:rollup2
DIRECTORS ARE INCLUDED IN THE

01:06:40.897 --> 01:06:45.201 region:rollup2
DEFINITION OF PATIENT CARE. AND

01:06:43.066 --> 01:06:48.371 region:rollup2
FOR US THAT WAS MADE INCREDIBLY

01:06:45.201 --> 01:06:49.939 region:rollup2
CLEAR. WHEN WE USE THE AMENDMENT

01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:51.574 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:54.043 region:rollup2
OF THE INITIATIVE BECAUSE

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:55.745 region:rollup2
INITIALLY WE HEADS EXPLICITLY

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:57.146 region:rollup2
EXCLUDED MEDICAL DIRECTORS. BUT

01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:58.381 region:rollup2
BASED ON FEEDBACK DURING THE

01:06:57.146 --> 01:07:00.083 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT PROCESS WE STRUCK

01:06:58.381 --> 01:07:02.318 region:rollup2
THOSE.

01:07:00.083 --> 01:07:02.819 region:rollup2
OF STRUCK THAT MENTION OF

01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:03.319 region:rollup2
MEDICAL DIRECTORS BEING

01:07:02.819 --> 01:07:04.320 region:rollup2
EXCLUDED.

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:06.356 region:rollup2
SO.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:08.892 region:rollup2
BOTH.

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:10.493 region:rollup2
BY THE INTENT AND ALSO WE WOULD

01:07:08.892 --> 01:07:11.494 region:rollup2
SAY THAT BY THAT DEFINITION THE

01:07:10.493 --> 01:07:14.430 region:rollup2
MEDICAL DIRECTOR IS NOT AN

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:17.066 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE OF THE CLINIC.

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:20.103 region:rollup2
OF. THEY ARE THEY'RE AN EXTERNAL

01:07:17.066 --> 01:07:22.338 region:rollup2
MEDICAL DIRECTOR. OF AND SO WE

01:07:20.103 --> 01:07:23.773 region:rollup2
ARE CONFIDENT THAT A READING OF

01:07:22.338 --> 01:07:24.874 region:rollup2
THE THE INTENT AND THE

01:07:23.773 --> 01:07:26.309 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE LANGUAGE WOULD

01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:27.944 region:rollup2
INCLUDE MEDICAL DIRECTORS

01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:29.312 region:rollup2
SO WITH THOSE SALARIES AND

01:07:27.944 --> 01:07:29.512 region:rollup2
INCLUDED IN THE GLOBAL CAPTAIN

01:07:29.312 --> 01:07:31.414 region:rollup2
YES.

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:32.916 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:07:31.414 --> 01:07:33.883 region:rollup2
AND TO YOU AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH

01:07:32.916 --> 01:07:35.652 region:rollup2
ON AVERAGE.

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:37.320 region:rollup2
PRIVATE INSURERS PAY FOR

01:07:35.652 --> 01:07:40.056 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:43.092 region:rollup2
AND MEDI CAL. AND MEDICARE.

01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:44.394 region:rollup2
SO PRIVATE INSURANCE PAYS ME

01:07:43.092 --> 01:07:45.929 region:rollup2
SAKE APPROXIMATELY A THOUSAND

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:46.396 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

01:07:45.929 --> 01:07:47.697 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE DIFFERENT

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:49.966 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS.

01:07:47.697 --> 01:07:52.101 region:rollup2
MEDICARE ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED

01:07:49.966 --> 01:07:54.070 region:rollup2
AND FIFTY DOLLARS.

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:55.972 region:rollup2
AND MEDI CAL SOMEWHAT LOWER.

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:58.675 region:rollup2
SO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT

01:07:55.972 --> 01:08:00.843 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL AND THAT MEDICARE

01:07:58.675 --> 01:08:02.412 region:rollup2
RATE. IS SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:05.648 region:rollup2
THAN WE SEE IN MANY OTHER

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:07.517 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL HEALTH CARE FEELS.

01:08:05.648 --> 01:08:08.151 region:rollup2
FOR MEDI CAL IS LESS THAN TWO

01:08:07.517 --> 01:08:10.353 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS YEAH BUT

01:08:08.151 --> 01:08:11.521 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PAYS.

01:08:10.353 --> 01:08:14.390 region:rollup2
AND YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW HOW MANY

01:08:11.521 --> 01:08:16.225 region:rollup2
PATIENTS ARE PRIVATE PAY IN OF

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:17.827 region:rollup2
THE SIXTY SIX THOUSAND PATIENTS

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:19.128 region:rollup2
HOW MANY ARE PRIVATE PAPERS IS.

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:20.229 region:rollup2
THOSE THAT ARE ON MEDI CAL AND

01:08:19.128 --> 01:08:21.464 region:rollup2
MEDICARE.

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:22.699 region:rollup2
THE ROUGH BREAKDOWN IS THAT IT'S

01:08:21.464 --> 01:08:24.233 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY PERCENT

01:08:22.699 --> 01:08:26.836 region:rollup2
MEDICARE.

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:28.137 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS IS A CARVE INTO

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:29.505 region:rollup2
MEDICARE EVEN FOR PATIENTS WHO

01:08:28.137 --> 01:08:31.674 region:rollup2
ARE UNDER SIXTY FIVE NOT

01:08:29.505 --> 01:08:32.208 region:rollup2
DISABLED. SO THE VAST MAJORITY

01:08:31.674 --> 01:08:35.611 region:rollup2
PATIENTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:36.713 region:rollup2
MEDICARE. THERE'S ROUGHLY.

01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:38.481 region:rollup2
TEN PERCENT.

01:08:36.713 --> 01:08:39.749 region:rollup2
MEDIC HAL.

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:41.684 region:rollup2
AND THEN ROUGHLY TEN PERCENT

01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:42.685 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL.

01:08:41.684 --> 01:08:44.854 region:rollup2
THOSE NUMBERS FLUCTUATE SOME

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:46.389 region:rollup2
EACH YEAR.

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:47.757 region:rollup2
AND THEN HOW HOW DID HOW DID YOU

01:08:46.389 --> 01:08:50.393 region:rollup2
COME UP WITH WHAT YOU CONSIDER

01:08:47.757 --> 01:08:53.162 region:rollup2
FAIR AND REASONABLE PAYMENT.

01:08:50.393 --> 01:08:53.162 region:rollup2
WE LOOKED TO THE ACA.

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:55.665 region:rollup2
RATIO IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:56.1000 region:rollup2
ACT.

01:08:55.665 --> 01:08:58.768 region:rollup2
THAT REGULATES WHAT IS

01:08:56.1000 --> 01:09:00.770 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED A FAIR AND REASONABLE

01:08:58.768 --> 01:09:02.639 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFIT.

01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:05.308 region:rollup2
FOR GROUP HEALTH PLANS.

01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:06.943 region:rollup2
THEN THE RATIO THERE IS CITED

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:08.077 region:rollup2
EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT PATIENT CARE

01:09:06.943 --> 01:09:09.712 region:rollup2
AND FIFTEEN PERCENT

01:09:08.077 --> 01:09:13.116 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFIT.

01:09:09.712 --> 01:09:15.451 region:rollup2
SO. WE BASED IT AROUND THAT ACA

01:09:13.116 --> 01:09:18.755 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK FOR HEALTH PLANS.

01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:19.622 region:rollup2
SO YOU'VE YOU'VE ESSENTIALLY.

01:09:18.755 --> 01:09:21.157 region:rollup2
TREATED SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT AS

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:22.158 region:rollup2
AS IF.

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:24.527 region:rollup2
ONE OF THESE COMPANIES IS A

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:25.928 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLAN.

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:28.197 region:rollup2
IT WAS MORE THAT THAT THAT THAT

01:09:25.928 --> 01:09:31.768 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE THAT THAT RATIO AND

01:09:28.197 --> 01:09:34.037 region:rollup2
THAT FRAMEWORK HAD ALREADY BEEN.

01:09:31.768 --> 01:09:36.906 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATED ITEMS TESTED IN THE

01:09:34.037 --> 01:09:38.408 region:rollup2
ACA AND SO AS WE WERE LOOKING TO

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:40.276 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THAT RIGHT NUMBER.

01:09:38.408 --> 01:09:42.311 region:rollup2
DO WE AND TWO WE GO WITH

01:09:40.276 --> 01:09:44.514 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE A. OF PERCENTAGE

01:09:42.311 --> 01:09:47.617 region:rollup2
OF ABOVE MEDICARE OR PERCENTAGE

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:49.786 region:rollup2
OF MEDI CAL. OR COST BASED

01:09:47.617 --> 01:09:52.188 region:rollup2
AND SEEING THE ACA'S FRAMEWORK

01:09:49.786 --> 01:09:54.223 region:rollup2
OF THAT COST BASED. OF.

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:56.693 region:rollup2
AS.

01:09:54.223 --> 01:09:58.828 region:rollup2
OPERATING WELL IN THE CA.

01:09:56.693 --> 01:10:00.797 region:rollup2
AND REALLY SEEING THAT. A

01:09:58.828 --> 01:10:02.065 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL MODEL WE LOOKED TO

01:10:00.797 --> 01:10:04.600 region:rollup2
EXTENDED DOWN AND WHAT IS THIS

01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:05.802 region:rollup2
VERY UNIQUE INDUSTRY.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.171 region:rollup2
WITHIN HEALTH CARE FOR THERE IS

01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:09.605 region:rollup2
SUCH MARKET CONSOLIDATION SUCH

01:10:08.171 --> 01:10:10.907 region:rollup2
MONOPOLY.

01:10:09.605 --> 01:10:12.241 region:rollup2
TO TREATED A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY

01:10:10.907 --> 01:10:13.543 region:rollup2
THAN THE REST OF HEALTH CARE SO

01:10:12.241 --> 01:10:15.511 region:rollup2
HAS THAT BEEN EXPLORED ANYWHERE

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:16.079 region:rollup2
ELSE OTHER MEANS OTHER THAN

01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:17.046 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS INITIATIVE OR

01:10:16.079 --> 01:10:19.148 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS.

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:20.016 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS APPROACH BECAUSE I

01:10:19.148 --> 01:10:21.951 region:rollup2
BUT NOT I'M GONNA MOMENT I'M

01:10:20.016 --> 01:10:22.318 region:rollup2
ASKING JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE I AM

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:24.787 region:rollup2
NOT AWARE THAT.

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:27.190 region:rollup2
THAT THIS.

01:10:24.787 --> 01:10:28.458 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN APPLIED TO OTHER AND IN

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:30.093 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER STATE SO IS THIS IS

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:30.993 region:rollup2
THIS UNIQUE IT'S FAIRLY NOVEL

01:10:30.093 --> 01:10:33.730 region:rollup2
APPROACH WITHIN.

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:36.799 region:rollup2
WITH INTO ALICE'S IN PARTICULAR

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:38.101 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS. IT DOES ALSO. MIRROR

01:10:36.799 --> 01:10:40.169 region:rollup2
TO SOME EXTENT THE WAY THAT WE

01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:42.071 region:rollup2
ADDRESS OTHER MONOPOLIES AND

01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:42.371 region:rollup2
OTHER HIGHLY CONCENTRATED

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:44.907 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES.

01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:45.842 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE SOMETHING LIKE.

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:47.944 region:rollup2
.

01:10:45.842 --> 01:10:49.445 region:rollup2
A PROFIT SETTING REGIME WITHIN A

01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:52.782 region:rollup2
UTILITY.

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:54.851 region:rollup2
OR OTHER MONOPOLY ARE HIGHLY

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:57.253 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATED MARKETS BUT WITHIN

01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:59.355 region:rollup2
A HEALTH CARE WITHIN A DIALYSIS.

01:10:57.253 --> 01:11:01.290 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY THIS IS FAIRLY UNIQUE

01:10:59.355 --> 01:11:01.891 region:rollup2
MODEL SO FAR.

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:04.127 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO SPREAD TO

01:11:01.891 --> 01:11:05.294 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES.

01:11:04.127 --> 01:11:06.829 region:rollup2
AND.

01:11:05.294 --> 01:11:11.000 region:rollup2
OF.

01:11:06.829 --> 01:11:12.368 region:rollup2
MY MISTER MAKES PERSON.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.870 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T THOSE NUMBERS WERE

01:11:12.368 --> 01:11:15.705 region:rollup2
INTERESTING ABOUT THAT RELEASE

01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:18.174 region:rollup2
ONLY TEN PERCENT PRIVATE PAYERS

01:11:15.705 --> 01:11:19.976 region:rollup2
SO IF EIGHTY PERCENT IS MEDICARE

01:11:18.174 --> 01:11:21.477 region:rollup2
TEN PERCENT IS MEDI CAL THE

01:11:19.976 --> 01:11:23.212 region:rollup2
OTHER TEN PERCENT SO.

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:24.580 region:rollup2
HOW WILL LIMITING WHAT INSURANCE

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:27.150 region:rollup2
COMPANIES PAY HOW IS THAT GOING

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:29.852 region:rollup2
TO BOMB IMPROVE CARE FOR?

01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:32.822 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS PATIENTS.

01:11:29.852 --> 01:11:34.690 region:rollup2
SO. THE WAY THAT. THE WEIGHT THE

01:11:32.822 --> 01:11:36.459 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE IS SET UP.

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:38.427 region:rollup2
IS THAT DIALYSIS.

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:40.196 region:rollup2
COMPANIES APTLY AT THE CORPORATE

01:11:38.427 --> 01:11:41.430 region:rollup2
LEVEL. WOULD BE ABLE TO ADD

01:11:40.196 --> 01:11:43.499 region:rollup2
TOGETHER ALL OF THEIR PATIENT

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:44.801 region:rollup2
CARE COST.

01:11:43.499 --> 01:11:46.669 region:rollup2
SO WHETHER THAT PATIENT CARE

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:47.603 region:rollup2
EXPENSE WAS ON BEHALF OF A MEDI

01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:49.906 region:rollup2
CAL PATIENT OR ON BEHALF OF THE

01:11:47.603 --> 01:11:52.275 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL PATIENT.

01:11:49.906 --> 01:11:55.478 region:rollup2
THOSE WOULD ALL GO INTO THE SAME

01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:57.346 region:rollup2
COOL OF PATIENT CARE COST.

01:11:55.478 --> 01:12:00.483 region:rollup2
AND THAT WOULD BE COMPARED TO A

01:11:57.346 --> 01:12:02.418 region:rollup2
POOL OF REVENUE.

01:12:00.483 --> 01:12:03.719 region:rollup2
AGAIN FROM COMMERCIAL PATIENTS

01:12:02.418 --> 01:12:05.288 region:rollup2
PAYERS AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT

01:12:03.719 --> 01:12:08.090 region:rollup2
PAYERS.

01:12:05.288 --> 01:12:09.825 region:rollup2
AND THEN IF THAT REVENUE EXCEEDS

01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:11.794 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT CARE COST BY MORE

01:12:09.825 --> 01:12:13.763 region:rollup2
THAN FIFTEEN PERCENT. THAT WOULD

01:12:11.794 --> 01:12:15.531 region:rollup2
TRIGGER THE REBATES SO WHAT IT

01:12:13.763 --> 01:12:17.200 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DOES IS CREATE THE

01:12:15.531 --> 01:12:18.901 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE.

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.203 region:rollup2
FOR DIALYSIS CLINICS TO

01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:22.438 region:rollup2
TREAT MEDI CAL AND MEDICARE

01:12:20.203 --> 01:12:23.706 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:25.308 region:rollup2
THE EXACT SAME WAY THAT THEY

01:12:23.706 --> 01:12:26.142 region:rollup2
TREAT COMMERCIAL PATIENTS BE

01:12:25.308 --> 01:12:27.944 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'LL GET EVERY DOLLAR

01:12:26.142 --> 01:12:29.712 region:rollup2
THEY INVEST.

01:12:27.944 --> 01:12:31.380 region:rollup2
IN A PATIENT'S CARE.

01:12:29.712 --> 01:12:33.149 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT PATIENTS MEDICAL OF

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:36.519 region:rollup2
MEDICARE OR COMMERCIAL WILL GO

01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:38.721 region:rollup2
TO RAISE THEIR OVERALL CAP.

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:39.989 region:rollup2
A.

01:12:38.721 --> 01:12:41.858 region:rollup2
STRIP STRUGGLING WITH ECONOMICS

01:12:39.989 --> 01:12:44.093 region:rollup2
THAT A LITTLE BIT DOWN.

01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:44.994 region:rollup2
SO WILL ONE OF THE STATED GOALS

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:46.229 region:rollup2
OF THE INITIATIVES THE FORCED

01:12:44.994 --> 01:12:47.763 region:rollup2
ALICE'S CLINICS TO HIRE MORE

01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:48.831 region:rollup2
WORKERS.

01:12:47.763 --> 01:12:53.569 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW WILL CLINICS BE ABLE TO

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:54.737 region:rollup2
DO THAT IF THEY'RE CAP ON COSTS.

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:57.740 region:rollup2
NOTHING CREE IN INITIATIVE

01:12:54.737 --> 01:13:00.509 region:rollup2
CREATES A CAP ON COSTS.

01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:03.713 region:rollup2
A BONE. IF AS THE COSTS RISE AS

01:13:00.509 --> 01:13:06.048 region:rollup2
THEY HIRE ANOTHER NURSE AS THEY.

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:09.752 region:rollup2
STAFF BETTER. BY YOU BY NEW

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:11.053 region:rollup2
SUPPLIES EXPAND TO NEW CLINICS.

01:13:09.752 --> 01:13:12.788 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THERE THAT

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:14.223 region:rollup2
THE REVENUE THAT THEY CAN KEEP

01:13:12.788 --> 01:13:21.063 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF THE YEAR WHAT RISE

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:22.865 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO CAP ON COSTS.

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:24.166 region:rollup2
YEAH I'M LIKE A KIND OF FOLLOW

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:27.169 region:rollup2
UP ON THE COMMENT YOU MADE WITH

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:28.738 region:rollup2
REGARD TO THE ABILITY TO TREAT

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:29.038 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL MEDICARE PATIENTS

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:30.773 region:rollup2
EQUALLY AS.

01:13:29.038 --> 01:13:33.109 region:rollup2
.

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:34.577 region:rollup2
SAY PRIVATE BEER COMMERCIAL AND%

01:13:33.109 --> 01:13:36.479 region:rollup2
SELECTORS TO ISSUES AT HAND

01:13:34.577 --> 01:13:37.947 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE IS THE TREATMENT OF

01:13:36.479 --> 01:13:40.149 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT WHICH I HAVE SOME

01:13:37.947 --> 01:13:41.450 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE HERE OF INDIVIDUALS ARE

01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:43.185 region:rollup2
SAYING THIS.

01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:45.521 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE EXTREME PROFITS

01:13:43.185 --> 01:13:47.256 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE NOT STATING THAT THE

01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:48.791 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS INDUSTRY WHICH IS.

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:51.060 region:rollup2
BEING DOMINATED BY ESSENTIALLY

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:52.862 region:rollup2
TWO ENTITIES IS MAKING.

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:54.263 region:rollup2
WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU SHOW OR DO

01:13:52.862 --> 01:13:56.198 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BECAUSE I HAVE A REAL

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:58.167 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IF SOMEBODY ON MEDICAID

01:13:56.198 --> 01:13:59.068 region:rollup2
OR MEDICARE IS BEING TREATED

01:13:58.167 --> 01:14:00.636 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY THAN SOMEBODY IN

01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:01.971 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL?

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:03.773 region:rollup2
WHAT KIND OF ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE

01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:06.175 region:rollup2
DO WE HAVE?

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:06.509 region:rollup2
BUT SENATOR YEAH I'D LIKE TO

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:07.443 region:rollup2
SPEAK TO THAT.

01:14:06.509 --> 01:14:09.445 region:rollup2
.

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:11.180 region:rollup2
AS A DIALYSIS NURSE WORKING FOR

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:13.182 region:rollup2
TO BE TO ENFORCE ANY HAS I'VE

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:14.450 region:rollup2
SEEN FIRSTHAND. WHERE THE

01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:15.117 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY HAS?

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:17.119 region:rollup2
?

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:19.555 region:rollup2
PRETTY MUCH.

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:21.290 region:rollup2
TAKEN THE RELATIONSHIP THAT I

01:14:19.555 --> 01:14:22.558 region:rollup2
HAVE AS A NURSE.

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:23.059 region:rollup2
BUT MY PATIENTS AND SOCIAL

01:14:22.558 --> 01:14:25.294 region:rollup2
WORKERS HAVE WITH THEIR

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:27.063 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:28.831 region:rollup2
AND HAVE IN.

01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:30.766 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS TO ENGAGE PATIENTS

01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:32.501 region:rollup2
AND TO TRY TO CONVERT THEM FROM

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:34.270 region:rollup2
THEIR MEDICARE HOW. AND THEIR

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:36.706 region:rollup2
MEDICARE AND TO THESE PRIVATE

01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:37.807 region:rollup2
INSURANCE'S.

01:14:36.706 --> 01:14:39.108 region:rollup2
PURELY FOR PROFIT.

01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:40.876 region:rollup2
.

01:14:39.108 --> 01:14:42.878 region:rollup2
THEY DISGUISE IT.

01:14:40.876 --> 01:14:44.613 region:rollup2
BOB VERY WELL.

01:14:42.878 --> 01:14:46.716 region:rollup2
PATIENTS ARE REALLY NOT

01:14:44.613 --> 01:14:47.350 region:rollup2
INFORMED ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE

01:14:46.716 --> 01:14:50.353 region:rollup2
DOING AND WHAT THE.

01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:51.721 region:rollup2
THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS.

01:14:50.353 --> 01:14:53.089 region:rollup2
FOR ITS AS IF THEY GET A

01:14:51.721 --> 01:14:55.358 region:rollup2
TRANSPLANT.

01:14:53.089 --> 01:14:56.826 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS IS A PATIENT WILL

01:14:55.358 --> 01:14:59.528 region:rollup2
NO LONGER BE QUALIFIED TO

01:14:56.826 --> 01:15:01.497 region:rollup2
RECEIVE A THIRD PARTY PAYER FROM

01:14:59.528 --> 01:15:01.864 region:rollup2
THE A. K. HALF? AND THEY'LL END

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:03.866 region:rollup2
UP.

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:05.334 region:rollup2
HAPPEN TO CARRY THAT TWENTY

01:15:03.866 --> 01:15:07.303 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:09.238 region:rollup2
PREMIUM THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO

01:15:07.303 --> 01:15:10.806 region:rollup2
PAY. AND AS WE KNOW MOST

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:12.541 region:rollup2
PATIENTS THEIR ON DIALYSIS ON

01:15:10.806 --> 01:15:14.076 region:rollup2
DISABILITY. THEY CAN'T AFFORD

01:15:12.541 --> 01:15:15.244 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN AFFORD THAT

01:15:14.076 --> 01:15:16.712 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IS GOING TO

01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:18.280 region:rollup2
COST HIM FOR THE ANTI REJECTION

01:15:16.712 --> 01:15:21.150 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:22.051 region:rollup2
THEY CAN AFFORD IT AND SO.

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:24.086 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE.

01:15:22.051 --> 01:15:24.286 region:rollup2
PUT PRESSURE ON SOCIAL WORKERS

01:15:24.086 --> 01:15:26.789 region:rollup2
AND.

01:15:24.286 --> 01:15:28.391 region:rollup2
NURSES TO SPEAK TO PATIENTS

01:15:26.789 --> 01:15:29.291 region:rollup2
ABOUT CONVERTING OVER TO THESE

01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:31.127 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PLANTS.

01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:32.928 region:rollup2
AS.

01:15:31.127 --> 01:15:34.530 region:rollup2
PURE PROFIT HAS NOTHING TO DO

01:15:32.928 --> 01:15:35.765 region:rollup2
WITH THE PATIENT RELATIONSHIP

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:37.166 region:rollup2
THANK YOU CARE LESS ABOUT WHAT'S

01:15:35.765 --> 01:15:39.068 region:rollup2
GOING ON WITH THE PATIENT. IT'S

01:15:37.166 --> 01:15:41.003 region:rollup2
ALL ABOUT MONEY LET'S BE CLEAR

01:15:39.068 --> 01:15:42.238 region:rollup2
HERE IT IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:43.305 region:rollup2
SOCIALIST LET'S FOLLOW UP AND

01:15:42.238 --> 01:15:45.408 region:rollup2
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT.

01:15:43.305 --> 01:15:47.009 region:rollup2
MANAGE STANDING CREEK WHERE I'M

01:15:45.408 --> 01:15:47.943 region:rollup2
WRONG THAT IF YOU ARE GET TEN IN

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:49.545 region:rollup2
STAGE RENAL DISEASE

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:51.647 region:rollup2
AUTOMATICALLY QUALIFY FOR

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:53.749 region:rollup2
MEDICARE AT THAT POINT. I DON'T

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:53.916 region:rollup2
THINK YOU CAN TRANSFER OVER. TO

01:15:53.749 --> 01:15:56.419 region:rollup2
A.

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:57.787 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL PAY AND IT WAS MY

01:15:56.419 --> 01:15:59.121 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THAT WHAT YOU'RE

01:15:57.787 --> 01:16:01.056 region:rollup2
TELLING ME IS THAT TEN PERCENT.

01:15:59.121 --> 01:16:02.024 region:rollup2
OF THE COMMERCIAL MARKET WHEN

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:04.093 region:rollup2
YOU'RE COMPARING THE RATES OF A

01:16:02.024 --> 01:16:05.795 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TO FIFTY UNLESS FOR

01:16:04.093 --> 01:16:07.696 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL. SOME ASSUMING THAT

01:16:05.795 --> 01:16:09.665 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF COST SHIFTING

01:16:07.696 --> 01:16:10.299 region:rollup2
ON THE COMMERCIAL DOT ORG

01:16:09.665 --> 01:16:12.301 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

01:16:10.299 --> 01:16:14.070 region:rollup2
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN IF

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:15.471 region:rollup2
THERE IS A LOT OF COST SHIFTING

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:16.972 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEY BECOME AND STAGE

01:16:15.471 --> 01:16:19.008 region:rollup2
RENAL IT SEEMED LIKE THAT WOULD

01:16:16.972 --> 01:16:20.476 region:rollup2
BE TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE TO TRY

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:21.610 region:rollup2
TO ENCOURAGE PATIENTS TO GO INTO

01:16:20.476 --> 01:16:24.079 region:rollup2
THE COMMERCIAL MARKET.

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:27.116 region:rollup2
HERE'S A CONCERN I HAVE.

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:28.317 region:rollup2
IF WE HAVE COST SHIFTING.

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:30.486 region:rollup2
AND YOU HAVE AN INDUSTRY THAT'S

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:31.921 region:rollup2
PROFITING IN EXCESS PROFITS

01:16:30.486 --> 01:16:32.521 region:rollup2
A COST SHIFTING IS GOING OF

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:33.522 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL GUESS WHO PAYS FOR

01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:35.491 region:rollup2
IT.

01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:36.625 region:rollup2
WAITED ALL OF US THAT'S RIGHT

01:16:35.491 --> 01:16:38.227 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE REAL REAL CONCERN AND

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:38.227 region:rollup2
THAT I HAVE.

01:16:38.561 --> 01:16:40.062 region:rollup2
IT'S TO COST SHIFTING TO THE

01:16:40.129 --> 01:16:45.634 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY.

01:16:42.097 --> 01:16:47.603 region:rollup2
MAN YOU KNOW SO.

01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:49.638 region:rollup2
A QUESTION I HAVE IS.

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:51.140 region:rollup2
WITH REGARD TO THE PROBABILITY

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:52.575 region:rollup2
MAYBE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE ANSWER

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:54.343 region:rollup2
THIS BECAUSE I HEARD AND MAYBE

01:16:52.575 --> 01:16:54.944 region:rollup2
AFTER GOD WHO WAS IT SAID THAT

01:16:54.343 --> 01:16:55.544 region:rollup2
THERE IS FIVE TIMES HIGHER AND

01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:57.079 region:rollup2
I'VE.

01:16:55.544 --> 01:16:58.581 region:rollup2
HEARD THAT YOU KNOW THAT THEIR

01:16:57.079 --> 01:16:59.482 region:rollup2
PROFIT MARGINS DIALYSIS CLINICS

01:16:58.581 --> 01:17:01.083 region:rollup2
HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY

01:16:59.482 --> 01:17:03.452 region:rollup2
PAST SEVEN YEARS TEN YEARS TO

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:04.787 region:rollup2
SEVENTY PERCENT. WHERE YOU

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:05.354 region:rollup2
GETTING THIS INFORMATION FROM

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:07.289 region:rollup2
THE AND WE HAVE ANY EVIDENCE

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:08.757 region:rollup2
AND?

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:10.626 region:rollup2
DATA THAT CAN SHOW.

01:17:08.757 --> 01:17:11.927 region:rollup2
THE PROFITABILITY MARGINS.

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:13.696 region:rollup2
SO THE FIRST PLACE WE'RE

01:17:11.927 --> 01:17:14.263 region:rollup2
GETTING THIS DATA IS FROM OUR

01:17:13.696 --> 01:17:16.599 region:rollup2
SPOT.

01:17:14.263 --> 01:17:18.701 region:rollup2
THAT CLINICS AT THE CLINIC

01:17:16.599 --> 01:17:20.636 region:rollup2
LEVEL REPORT THEIR PROFITABILITY

01:17:18.701 --> 01:17:22.104 region:rollup2
EACH YEAR. AND ALSO REPORTED

01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:25.007 region:rollup2
GOVERNING ENTITIES WE CAN ROLL

01:17:22.104 --> 01:17:26.041 region:rollup2
THAT UP EASILY AND SO. OFTEN

01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:28.477 region:rollup2
DATA SHOWS THAT IN TWENTY

01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:30.346 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN THE DIALYSIS INDUSTRY

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:32.748 region:rollup2
PROFITED ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED

01:17:30.346 --> 01:17:34.617 region:rollup2
AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS JUST

01:17:32.748 --> 01:17:37.086 region:rollup2
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:17:34.617 --> 01:17:38.387 region:rollup2
AND I WANT TO ANNOUNCE.

01:17:37.086 --> 01:17:40.155 region:rollup2
BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:42.658 region:rollup2
PERCENT PROFIT MARGIN AND THAT'S

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:44.293 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH THE TOO LARGE

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:46.996 region:rollup2
FOR PROFIT COMPANIES. PROFIT

01:17:44.293 --> 01:17:49.632 region:rollup2
MARGIN NATIONALLY AS WELL.

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:51.200 region:rollup2
AND I DO WANT TO WANT TO FOCUS A

01:17:49.632 --> 01:17:51.734 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ON THAT FOUR HUNDRED

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.202 region:rollup2
AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR

01:17:51.734 --> 01:17:55.571 region:rollup2
NUMBER.

01:17:53.202 --> 01:17:57.573 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AS THE LA OVARIAN

01:17:55.571 --> 01:17:59.508 region:rollup2
CORRECTLY REPORTED.

01:17:57.573 --> 01:18:01.377 region:rollup2
THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:03.112 region:rollup2
GENERATE A FEW HUNDRED MILLION

01:18:01.377 --> 01:18:05.447 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

01:18:03.112 --> 01:18:07.182 region:rollup2
IN REDUCTIONS IN WHERE THE

01:18:05.447 --> 01:18:10.286 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY IS CURRENTLY ABOVE THAT

01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:12.221 region:rollup2
REVENUE CAP.

01:18:10.286 --> 01:18:13.722 region:rollup2
SO EVEN IF

01:18:12.221 --> 01:18:15.190 region:rollup2
THAT FEW HUNDRED MILLIONS OF

01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:16.926 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN WHICH THEY'RE

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:19.728 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY ABOVE THE CAP.

01:18:16.926 --> 01:18:21.497 region:rollup2
ALL HAD TO BE ISSUED IN REFUNDS

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:22.898 region:rollup2
THAT STILL LEAVES THE DIALYSIS

01:18:21.497 --> 01:18:26.135 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY WITH HUNDREDS OF

01:18:22.898 --> 01:18:29.071 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROFIT.

01:18:26.135 --> 01:18:31.640 region:rollup2
AND SO I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

01:18:29.071 --> 01:18:34.310 region:rollup2
ANY CLAIM THAT THERE WOULD BE.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:36.212 region:rollup2
NO PROFIT LEFT IN THIS INDUSTRY

01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:37.279 region:rollup2
OR THAT THERE WOULD NEED TO BE

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:39.014 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF REDUCTION IN

01:18:37.279 --> 01:18:41.083 region:rollup2
SERVICES BECAUSE THERE WOULD NOT

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:42.885 region:rollup2
BE A RETURN ON CAPITAL.

01:18:41.083 --> 01:18:43.819 region:rollup2
IS REALLY CLAIMING THAT HUNDREDS

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:45.754 region:rollup2
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS STILL

01:18:43.819 --> 01:18:47.022 region:rollup2
ISN'T ENOUGH.

01:18:45.754 --> 01:18:49.458 region:rollup2
AND THAT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH

01:18:47.022 --> 01:18:50.793 region:rollup2
PROFITS WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT.

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:52.227 region:rollup2
WHAT A CLINIC PEOPLE WOULD OCCUR

01:18:50.793 --> 01:18:54.063 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS COMPANY BE PROFITABLE

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:55.197 region:rollup2
OR NOT?

01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:56.065 region:rollup2
WE'RE SAYING ARE THEY STILL

01:18:55.197 --> 01:18:57.866 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

01:18:56.065 --> 01:18:59.535 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN PERCENT

01:18:57.866 --> 01:19:01.103 region:rollup2
PROFIT MARGINS OR THEY'RE GOING

01:18:59.535 --> 01:19:03.138 region:rollup2
TO HAVE TO COME MORE IN LINE

01:19:01.103 --> 01:19:04.840 region:rollup2
WITH FOR EXAMPLE THE FIVE

01:19:03.138 --> 01:19:05.908 region:rollup2
PERCENT PROFIT MARGIN THAT IS

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:07.743 region:rollup2
THE AVERAGE FOR HOSPITALS IN

01:19:05.908 --> 01:19:09.678 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:11.547 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT TRYING.

01:19:09.678 --> 01:19:13.215 region:rollup2
TO ELIMINATE.

01:19:11.547 --> 01:19:15.618 region:rollup2
PROFIT IN THIS INDUSTRY WE'RE

01:19:13.215 --> 01:19:16.685 region:rollup2
TRYING TO BRING IT INTO LINE

01:19:15.618 --> 01:19:18.087 region:rollup2
WITH WHAT THE REST OF THE

01:19:16.685 --> 01:19:20.689 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY.

01:19:18.087 --> 01:19:22.324 region:rollup2
VERY SUCCESSFULLY OPERATES WITH

01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:24.226 region:rollup2
IT IN LIMIT LET ME JUST SAY

01:19:22.324 --> 01:19:25.728 region:rollup2
AGAIN FOLLOW POLLUTED MORE AND

01:19:24.226 --> 01:19:26.829 region:rollup2
THE COMMENT YOU MADE AND. WITH

01:19:25.728 --> 01:19:28.631 region:rollup2
REGARD TO THE OVERALL

01:19:26.829 --> 01:19:29.965 region:rollup2
PROFITABILITY OF ANY ENTITY

01:19:28.631 --> 01:19:32.101 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S.

01:19:29.965 --> 01:19:32.868 region:rollup2
OVERALL.

01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:36.205 region:rollup2
COMBINED.

01:19:32.868 --> 01:19:37.706 region:rollup2
GROUP OF CLINICS SOME IS GONNA

01:19:36.205 --> 01:19:38.907 region:rollup2
READ A SECTION FROM THE.

01:19:37.706 --> 01:19:40.376 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE FOR THE PURPOSE OF

01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:41.910 region:rollup2
THIS SECTION THE FAIR TREATMENT.

01:19:40.376 --> 01:19:43.812 region:rollup2
PAYMENT AMOUNT SHALL BE THE

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:45.347 region:rollup2
AMOUNT EQUAL TO ONE HUNDRED

01:19:43.812 --> 01:19:46.682 region:rollup2
FIFTY PERCENT OF THE SOME.

01:19:45.347 --> 01:19:48.617 region:rollup2
OF ALL DIRECT PATIENT CARE

01:19:46.682 --> 01:19:50.219 region:rollup2
SERVICES COSTS AND ALL HEALTH

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:52.655 region:rollup2
CARE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT COSTS

01:19:50.219 --> 01:19:55.057 region:rollup2
INCURRED. BY GOVERNING ANTI AND

01:19:52.655 --> 01:19:56.992 region:rollup2
IT'S CHRONIC DIALYSIS CLINICS SO

01:19:55.057 --> 01:20:00.429 region:rollup2
EVEN IF YOU WERE TO HIRE MORE

01:19:56.992 --> 01:20:01.430 region:rollup2
NURSES INCREASE THE I. T. THAT

01:20:00.429 --> 01:20:02.998 region:rollup2
GOES THAT'S TAKEN INTO

01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:05.334 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION AND THAT ON TOP OF

01:20:02.998 --> 01:20:07.603 region:rollup2
THAT STILL ALLOWS EVERY ENTITY

01:20:05.334 --> 01:20:09.338 region:rollup2
EVEN IF YOU HAVE. A GOVERNING

01:20:07.603 --> 01:20:11.473 region:rollup2
ENTITY THAT HAS SOME CLINICS

01:20:09.338 --> 01:20:13.442 region:rollup2
THAT ARE NOT AS WELL BUT THE

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:14.476 region:rollup2
OVERALL TO HAVE AT LEAST A

01:20:13.442 --> 01:20:15.544 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN PERCENT PROFIT MARGIN.

01:20:14.476 --> 01:20:17.079 region:rollup2
WHICH

01:20:15.544 --> 01:20:18.847 region:rollup2
SEEMS TO ME FAIR AND REASONABLE

01:20:17.079 --> 01:20:20.649 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN IT ALSO TALK A LITTLE

01:20:18.847 --> 01:20:21.283 region:rollup2
BIT ABOUT MARKET CONSOLIDATIONS

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:22.584 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I

01:20:21.283 --> 01:20:23.886 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:25.421 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:20:23.886 --> 01:20:26.722 region:rollup2
IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN THE

01:20:25.421 --> 01:20:27.856 region:rollup2
COST SHIFTING IN THE LAND OF THE

01:20:26.722 --> 01:20:29.625 region:rollup2
EXPENSES THERE WERE HAVING

01:20:27.856 --> 01:20:31.026 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE SYSTEM. TO ME I THINK

01:20:29.625 --> 01:20:32.995 region:rollup2
THE BIGGEST AREAS AND THE

01:20:31.026 --> 01:20:34.697 region:rollup2
CONCERNS I HAVE IS EXACTLY THAT

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:35.898 region:rollup2
OF MARKET CONSOLIDATION.

01:20:34.697 --> 01:20:36.932 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT HEALTH PLANS BY OF

01:20:35.898 --> 01:20:38.400 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLANS YOU LOOKING

01:20:36.932 --> 01:20:40.069 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL SYSTEMS BY AN

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:41.670 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE SIZZLE MEDICAL GROUPS

01:20:40.069 --> 01:20:43.906 region:rollup2
BY A MEDICAL GROUPS.

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:45.741 region:rollup2
AND WHEN YOU HAVE CONSOLIDATION

01:20:43.906 --> 01:20:46.942 region:rollup2
IT COULD CREATE MONOPOLIZATION.

01:20:45.741 --> 01:20:48.744 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE MONOPOLIZATION

01:20:46.942 --> 01:20:50.346 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE THAT COULD CAUSE

01:20:48.744 --> 01:20:51.747 region:rollup2
INCREASE BECAUSE THOSE ARE

01:20:50.346 --> 01:20:52.948 region:rollup2
PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMERS IN

01:20:51.747 --> 01:20:53.282 region:rollup2
THE FORM OF HIGHER PREMIUMS ARE

01:20:52.948 --> 01:20:54.183 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE.

01:20:53.282 --> 01:20:55.984 region:rollup2
I GET

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:57.252 region:rollup2
SO.

01:20:55.984 --> 01:20:58.554 region:rollup2
I'VE I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS

01:20:57.252 --> 01:21:00.389 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY A PROBLEM AND I THINK

01:20:58.554 --> 01:21:01.256 region:rollup2
THERE'S ANOTHER IN THE AREA THAT

01:21:00.389 --> 01:21:02.591 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO CONTROL COSTS

01:21:01.256 --> 01:21:04.159 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY HIS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:05.694 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S ANOTHER CONVERSATION

01:21:04.159 --> 01:21:06.729 region:rollup2
FOR ANOTHER DAY WOULDN'T. ANYWAY

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:08.230 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS AND

01:21:06.729 --> 01:21:08.564 region:rollup2
COMMENTS THAT I HAVE THANK YOU

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:13.869 region:rollup2
TO SCARE HER.

01:21:08.564 --> 01:21:14.369 region:rollup2

PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:41.657 region:rollup2
WE ARE GRAVELY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:22:40.022 --> 01:22:43.458 region:rollup2
HIS BALLOT MEASURE WHAT

01:22:41.657 --> 01:22:45.494 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT ACCESS TO

01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:46.061 region:rollup2
DALLAS'S CARE FOR PATIENTS AND

01:22:45.494 --> 01:22:47.095 region:rollup2
JEOPARDIZE THEIR HEALTH AND

01:22:46.061 --> 01:22:48.130 region:rollup2
THEIR LIVES.

01:22:47.095 --> 01:22:49.565 region:rollup2
WHEN I WAS TWELVE I GOT

01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:50.966 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSED WITH THAT KIDNEY

01:22:49.565 --> 01:22:52.401 region:rollup2
DISEASE AS A RESULT OF THE

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:54.369 region:rollup2
BICYCLE ACCIDENT.

01:22:52.401 --> 01:22:56.538 region:rollup2
I'M THIRTY SEVEN SOME BLESSED

01:22:54.369 --> 01:22:58.373 region:rollup2
I ALSO I ALSO WAS ON DOUBTS AS

01:22:56.538 --> 01:23:00.242 region:rollup2
RETAIN YEARS PHONE VERY FAMILIAR

01:22:58.373 --> 01:23:01.476 region:rollup2
WITH THE CARE PROVIDED TO ME.

01:23:00.242 --> 01:23:03.078 region:rollup2
I WAS YOU WE CAN TRANSPLANT SAW

01:23:01.476 --> 01:23:05.214 region:rollup2
NO LONGER ANALYSIS

01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:06.481 region:rollup2
BUT I BECOME A PATIENT ADVOCATE

01:23:05.214 --> 01:23:07.683 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I KNOW FIRST HAND HOW

01:23:06.481 --> 01:23:09.651 region:rollup2
GRUELING THE PROCESS THAT THEY

01:23:07.683 --> 01:23:11.186 region:rollup2
ALSO USES.

01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:13.722 region:rollup2
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN TAOS

01:23:11.186 --> 01:23:15.224 region:rollup2
CLINGS HOPPING OTHER PATIENTS.

01:23:13.722 --> 01:23:17.426 region:rollup2
DEATH IS PATIENTS RECEIVE GAS IS

01:23:15.224 --> 01:23:20.329 region:rollup2
THREE TO FOUR TIMES.

01:23:17.426 --> 01:23:22.498 region:rollup2
A WEEK FOR FOUR HOURS AT A TIME.

01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:25.300 region:rollup2
WE ARE DEL THIS TAX AND NURSES

01:23:22.498 --> 01:23:27.336 region:rollup2
AND STAFF. ADEPTUS CLINK AS MUCH

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:28.804 region:rollup2
AS WE SEE OUR FAMILIES.

01:23:27.336 --> 01:23:30.239 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU FIRST HAND THAT

01:23:28.804 --> 01:23:32.107 region:rollup2
THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE.

01:23:30.239 --> 01:23:33.675 region:rollup2
PROPONENTS OF THIS INITIATIVE DO

01:23:32.107 --> 01:23:35.511 region:rollup2
NOT REPRESENT THE CARE THAT I

01:23:33.675 --> 01:23:37.112 region:rollup2
RECEIVE NOR DO THEY MATCH WHAT

01:23:35.511 --> 01:23:38.780 region:rollup2
I'VE HEARD FROM PATIENTS

01:23:37.112 --> 01:23:40.516 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY TREATING TODAY.

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:41.917 region:rollup2
I RECEIVED NOTHING BUT TOP NOTCH

01:23:40.516 --> 01:23:43.418 region:rollup2
CARE IN CLEAN AND HEALTHY

01:23:41.917 --> 01:23:45.120 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT.

01:23:43.418 --> 01:23:46.521 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES SENSES OF THAT MANY

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.722 region:rollup2
DEATHS PAGES I TALK TO ALL THE

01:23:46.521 --> 01:23:48.724 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:23:46.722 --> 01:23:49.458 region:rollup2
IF.

01:23:48.724 --> 01:23:51.059 region:rollup2
IF WE WERE TO BE HONEST

01:23:49.458 --> 01:23:51.860 region:rollup2
OURSELVES WE HAVE NO QUESTION

01:23:51.059 --> 01:23:53.562 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE BORDERS OF THE

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:57.533 region:rollup2
PROPONENTS.

01:23:53.562 --> 01:23:59.234 region:rollup2
S. C. I. E. W. YOU HW IS TRYING

01:23:57.533 --> 01:24:01.403 region:rollup2
TO ORGANIZE DAUSA THE WORKERS I

01:23:59.234 --> 01:24:02.838 region:rollup2
PERSONALLY DON'T CARE. ONE WAY

01:24:01.403 --> 01:24:04.039 region:rollup2
OR ANOTHER ABOUT IT.

01:24:02.838 --> 01:24:05.741 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN I DO CARE ABOUT THE

01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:07.409 region:rollup2
LITTLE MAKES ME VERY UPSET. IS

01:24:05.741 --> 01:24:10.145 region:rollup2
THAT IT APPEARS THAT YOU WHICH

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:11.747 region:rollup2
W. IS USING PATIENT THAT'S PONDS

01:24:10.145 --> 01:24:12.814 region:rollup2
TO PUT PRESSURE ON DIALYSIS.

01:24:11.747 --> 01:24:14.816 region:rollup2
COMPANIES TO UNIONIZE

01:24:12.814 --> 01:24:16.618 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

01:24:14.816 --> 01:24:19.121 region:rollup2
THEY DRAFTED INITIATIVE THAT IS

01:24:16.618 --> 01:24:19.788 region:rollup2
ONLY GOING TO HARM PATIENTS.

01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:22.357 region:rollup2
TAKING MONEY OUT OF THE HOUSE IS

01:24:19.788 --> 01:24:24.026 region:rollup2
CARE WILL IMPROVE PATIENT CARE

01:24:22.357 --> 01:24:25.694 region:rollup2
IT WILL MAKE MORE PATIENTS WORSE

01:24:24.026 --> 01:24:27.129 region:rollup2
OFF BECAUSE THEY CAN LOSE ACCESS

01:24:25.694 --> 01:24:28.530 region:rollup2
TO CARE.

01:24:27.129 --> 01:24:30.666 region:rollup2
THIS MEASURE LIMITS THE PRIVATE

01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:31.533 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANIES TO PAY THE

01:24:30.666 --> 01:24:33.168 region:rollup2
HOUSES COLLEAGUES TO PROVIDE

01:24:31.533 --> 01:24:35.170 region:rollup2
CARE. THESE THEM IS DO NOT

01:24:33.168 --> 01:24:36.939 region:rollup2
PROVIDE ENOUGH TO COVER THE

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:38.607 region:rollup2
OPERATING COSTS OF A CLINIC.

01:24:36.939 --> 01:24:40.275 region:rollup2
AND INITIALLY IT WILL FORCE MANY

01:24:38.607 --> 01:24:42.177 region:rollup2
CLAIMS CLINICS TO SHUT DOWN OR

01:24:40.275 --> 01:24:43.645 region:rollup2
REDUCE HOURS.

01:24:42.177 --> 01:24:45.314 region:rollup2
AND NOTHING IN THIS MEASURE

01:24:43.645 --> 01:24:47.683 region:rollup2
REQUIRES INSURANCE COMPANIES TO

01:24:45.314 --> 01:24:49.618 region:rollup2
PASS EVEN ONE CENT. OF THE LOWER

01:24:47.683 --> 01:24:51.053 region:rollup2
COST ONTO PATIENTS.

01:24:49.618 --> 01:24:52.888 region:rollup2
THIS MEASURE MAY BE GOOD FOR A

01:24:51.053 --> 01:24:54.590 region:rollup2
FEW INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT IT

01:24:52.888 --> 01:24:56.858 region:rollup2
WILL BE TERRIBLE FOR SIXTY SIX

01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:59.061 region:rollup2
THOUSAND PATIENTS WHO RELY ON

01:24:56.858 --> 01:25:00.996 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS TO SURVIVE.

01:24:59.061 --> 01:25:02.497 region:rollup2
AND THE PATIENT WILL BE HURT

01:25:00.996 --> 01:25:03.932 region:rollup2
WHAT WORST ARE THE PATIENT LOW

01:25:02.497 --> 01:25:05.834 region:rollup2
INCOME COMMUNITIES AS RURAL

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:08.870 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WE ACCESS TO CLINICS

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:09.871 region:rollup2
ALREADY. THAT ALREADY STRAINED.

01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:11.974 region:rollup2
KENNY FAILURE IS PARTICULARLY

01:25:09.871 --> 01:25:13.275 region:rollup2
ACUTE AMONG MINORITIES LATINOS

01:25:11.974 --> 01:25:14.910 region:rollup2
AND AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO HAVE

01:25:13.275 --> 01:25:16.345 region:rollup2
HIGHER.

01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:18.347 region:rollup2
INCIDENT OF KIDNEY FAILURE THAN

01:25:16.345 --> 01:25:20.148 region:rollup2
OTHER POPULATIONS.

01:25:18.347 --> 01:25:21.016 region:rollup2
THIS INITIATIVE WILL HARM SO THE

01:25:20.148 --> 01:25:22.417 region:rollup2
MORE VERBAL PATIENTS IN

01:25:21.016 --> 01:25:24.052 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:25.887 region:rollup2
TAKE MY SITUATION FOR EXAMPLE I

01:25:24.052 --> 01:25:27.623 region:rollup2
LIVE IN SELMA.

01:25:25.887 --> 01:25:29.358 region:rollup2
A IF THAT MY CLINIC. LONGTIME

01:25:27.623 --> 01:25:31.326 region:rollup2
CLOSES THE NEAREST CLINIC IS

01:25:29.358 --> 01:25:32.060 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILES AWAY. I

01:25:31.326 --> 01:25:33.662 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE ABLE TO GO THERE FOR

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:35.430 region:rollup2
TREATMENT BUT WHAT IF IT THAT

01:25:33.662 --> 01:25:37.366 region:rollup2
ONE CLOSES.

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:39.735 region:rollup2
THEN WHAT GORDO NEXT.

01:25:37.366 --> 01:25:41.336 region:rollup2
CLOSES WHEN WHAT IF ONE CAN TAKE

01:25:39.735 --> 01:25:43.105 region:rollup2
ME BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY FULL.

01:25:41.336 --> 01:25:44.673 region:rollup2
IF A PATIENT WHO HAVE TO TRAVEL

01:25:43.105 --> 01:25:46.541 region:rollup2
FURTHER TO DOWNSIZE BECAUSE THE

01:25:44.673 --> 01:25:48.343 region:rollup2
CLINIC IS CLOSED IT WILL PUT

01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:49.911 region:rollup2
FURTHER STRAIN ON THE PATIENT

01:25:48.343 --> 01:25:51.580 region:rollup2
AND THEIR FAMILIES.

01:25:49.911 --> 01:25:53.315 region:rollup2
EVEN WORSE IF CLINICS.

01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:54.816 region:rollup2
IF PLANTS CLOSE MANY PAVE WHO

01:25:53.315 --> 01:25:56.218 region:rollup2
WILL END UP AN EMERGENCY ROOM.

01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:57.986 region:rollup2
DUE TO COMPLICATIONS FOR MISSING

01:25:56.218 --> 01:26:00.222 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS AND PENSIONS WILL BEGIN

01:25:57.986 --> 01:26:01.156 region:rollup2
TO. GET INTO HOUSES IN THE

01:26:00.222 --> 01:26:02.891 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY ROOM INSTEAD OF

01:26:01.156 --> 01:26:04.793 region:rollup2
CLEANING CLINICS.

01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:06.128 region:rollup2
IT'S INFURIATING THAT PROPONENTS

01:26:04.793 --> 01:26:07.863 region:rollup2
WHAT PUT PATIENTS LIVES AT RISK

01:26:06.128 --> 01:26:09.498 region:rollup2
TO FURTHER THEIR POLITICALAND

01:26:07.863 --> 01:26:11.500 region:rollup2
UNION ORGANIZING AGENDA.

01:26:09.498 --> 01:26:13.335 region:rollup2
THIS INITIATIVE PUTS PATIENTS WE

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:15.237 region:rollup2
REPRESENT IN GREAT DANGER AND

01:26:13.335 --> 01:26:16.438 region:rollup2
THAT'S SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE.

01:26:15.237 --> 01:26:17.739 region:rollup2
AGAIN I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE

01:26:16.438 --> 01:26:19.608 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WANT TO TRY TO ORGANIZE

01:26:17.739 --> 01:26:21.410 region:rollup2
WORKERS BUT I HAVE A MAJOR

01:26:19.608 --> 01:26:22.611 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WHETHER YOU VULNERABLE

01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:24.112 region:rollup2
PATIENTS AS PAWNS.

01:26:22.611 --> 01:26:26.314 region:rollup2
THIS BALLOT INITIATIVE IS DEEPLY

01:26:24.112 --> 01:26:27.582 region:rollup2
FLAWED AND DANGEROUS THAT'S WHY

01:26:26.314 --> 01:26:29.484 region:rollup2
IS OPPOSED BY THE PATIENT

01:26:27.582 --> 01:26:30.952 region:rollup2
ADVOCACY GROUPS.

01:26:29.484 --> 01:26:32.287 region:rollup2
LIKE OURS THEY'RE GONNA SUPPORT

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

RENAL DISEASE AND THEY NEED

01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:18.700 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS TO SURVIVE.

01:27:16.331 --> 01:27:20.235 region:rollup2
MY PRIORITY AS A KIDNEY DOCTOR

I AM STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THIS

01:27:24.306 --> 01:27:27.709 region:rollup2
BALLOT PROPOSITION THAT WE ARE

01:27:25.774 --> 01:27:29.311 region:rollup2
DISCUSSING TODAY. THOUGH I DID

01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:31.346 region:rollup2
HEAR THE LAST.

01:27:29.311 --> 01:27:32.848 region:rollup2
PANEL MY CONCERN IS THAT

01:27:31.346 --> 01:27:34.583 region:rollup2
CLINICS WOULD CLOSE THAT SHIPS

01:27:32.848 --> 01:27:35.650 region:rollup2
WILL CLOSE.

01:27:34.583 --> 01:27:37.853 region:rollup2
AND THAT WOULD BE DISASTROUS FOR

01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:39.488 region:rollup2
MY PATIENTS AND FOR THE SIXTY

01:27:37.853 --> 01:27:41.957 region:rollup2

WITH ACCESS.

01:27:49.598 --> 01:27:53.735 region:rollup2
WITH DIALYSIS PATIENTS OBTAINING

01:27:51.533 --> 01:27:55.670 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO DIALYSIS.

01:27:53.735 --> 01:27:57.205 region:rollup2
WHEN I STARTED IN FRESNO THEIR

01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:58.673 region:rollup2
WERE LESS THAN A HANDFUL OF

01:27:57.205 --> 01:28:00.575 region:rollup2
CLINICS OPEN TO SERVE THE ENTIRE

01:27:58.673 --> 01:28:01.676 region:rollup2
AREA.

01:28:00.575 --> 01:28:03.145 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WAS GOING ON AT THAT

01:28:01.676 --> 01:28:04.679 region:rollup2
TIME IS THAT NEW DIALYSIS

01:28:03.145 --> 01:28:06.748 region:rollup2
PATIENTS WOULD DIAL EYES IN THE

01:28:04.679 --> 01:28:09.117 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL WHILE THEY WERE WAITING

01:28:06.748 --> 01:28:11.486 region:rollup2
FOR A CONFIRMED OUTPATIENT SPOT.

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:12.621 region:rollup2
OFTEN THIS WOULD TAKE MONTHS

01:28:11.486 --> 01:28:14.322 region:rollup2
SO THESE PATIENTS WERE DIAL

01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:16.424 region:rollup2
ISING IN THE HOSPITAL FOR MONTHS

01:28:14.322 --> 01:28:18.326 region:rollup2
AT A TIME.

01:28:16.424 --> 01:28:20.095 region:rollup2
AND IT CAN TAKE A LONG TIME TO

01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:21.429 region:rollup2
BUILD A NEW FACILITY. AND EVEN

01:28:20.095 --> 01:28:23.632 region:rollup2
LONGER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:28:21.429 --> 01:28:25.200 region:rollup2
HEALTH TO APPROVE ITS USE.

01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:26.968 region:rollup2
DURING THE TIME THESE PATIENTS

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:28.370 region:rollup2
WERE DIAL ISING IN THE HOSPITAL.

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:30.405 region:rollup2
THEY'D THEY OF COURSE NEED A

01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:32.741 region:rollup2
CONFIRMED SPOT BEFORE THEY CAN

01:28:30.405 --> 01:28:34.643 region:rollup2
LEAVE. AND I HOPE THE REASONS

01:28:32.741 --> 01:28:36.545 region:rollup2
FOR THAT ARE CLEAR TO YOU.

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:38.180 region:rollup2
MISSING DIALYSIS IS INCREDIBLY

01:28:36.545 --> 01:28:40.182 region:rollup2
DANGEROUS FOR THESE PEOPLE.

01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:42.784 region:rollup2
ONE MISS TREATMENT INCREASES THE

01:28:40.182 --> 01:28:44.319 region:rollup2
RISK OF DEATH BY THIRTY PERCENT

01:28:42.784 --> 01:28:45.720 region:rollup2
SO WE COULD NOT TAKE THAT RISK

01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:47.455 region:rollup2
THEY HAD TO STAY IN THE HOSPITAL

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:48.657 region:rollup2
UNTIL THEY FOUND A SPOT.

01:28:47.455 --> 01:28:50.625 region:rollup2
THESE PATIENTS HAD NO OTHER

01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:51.126 region:rollup2
ACUTE ISSUES THEY WERE JUST IN

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:53.328 region:rollup2
THE HOSPITAL TO RECEIVE

01:28:51.126 --> 01:28:54.596 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS.

01:28:53.328 --> 01:28:56.898 region:rollup2
THEY HAD TO TAKE TIME OFF FROM

01:28:54.596 --> 01:28:58.433 region:rollup2
WORK HAD TO BE AWAY FROM THEIR

01:28:56.898 --> 01:29:00.769 region:rollup2
FAMILIES THEIR OTHER

01:28:58.433 --> 01:29:02.103 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES. IT WAS A VERY

01:29:00.769 --> 01:29:03.505 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TIME FOR THESE

01:29:02.103 --> 01:29:05.207 region:rollup2
PATIENTS AND THIS LASTED FOR

01:29:03.505 --> 01:29:06.341 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS.

01:29:05.207 --> 01:29:07.809 region:rollup2
IT WAS A FRUSTRATING TIME TO BE

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:10.078 region:rollup2
A PHYSICIAN AND A FRUSTRATING

01:29:07.809 --> 01:29:10.579 region:rollup2
TIME TO BE A PART OF THE TEAM.

01:29:10.078 --> 01:29:12.914 region:rollup2
THAT TRIED TO HELP THESE

01:29:10.579 --> 01:29:15.517 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

01:29:12.914 --> 01:29:17.319 region:rollup2
SINCE THEN WE'VE MADE STRIDES IN

01:29:15.517 --> 01:29:18.887 region:rollup2
OBTAINING ACCESS TO PATIENTS.

01:29:17.319 --> 01:29:20.355 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK YOU CAN SEE HOW

01:29:18.887 --> 01:29:21.790 region:rollup2
LIMITING ACCESSCOULD REALLY

01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:24.359 region:rollup2
HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON

01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:26.294 region:rollup2
PATIENTS WHO NEED THE TREATMENT.

01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:27.629 region:rollup2
EACH CLINIC TREATS APPROXIMATELY

01:29:26.294 --> 01:29:30.131 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED TWENTY

01:29:27.629 --> 01:29:32.334 region:rollup2
PATIENTS THOUGH SOME TO FIFTY UP

01:29:30.131 --> 01:29:34.669 region:rollup2
TO THREE HUNDRED PATIENTS.

01:29:32.334 --> 01:29:35.737 region:rollup2
WHAT IT WOULD HAPPEN IF JUST ONE

01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:37.305 region:rollup2
OF THOSE CLINICS IN MY AREA

01:29:35.737 --> 01:29:38.406 region:rollup2
CLOSES

01:29:37.305 --> 01:29:39.708 region:rollup2
IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE HARD TO

01:29:38.406 --> 01:29:42.177 region:rollup2
IMAGINE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:29:39.708 --> 01:29:43.511 region:rollup2
PATIENTS? WITHOUT A PLACE TO GO.

01:29:42.177 --> 01:29:45.714 region:rollup2
NOW WHAT IF TO CLOSE.

01:29:43.511 --> 01:29:47.515 region:rollup2
FOR MORE.

01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:48.516 region:rollup2
WHERE WOULD THESE PATIENTS GO?

01:29:47.515 --> 01:29:49.584 region:rollup2
OF COURSE THE ONLY LOGICAL

01:29:48.516 --> 01:29:52.053 region:rollup2
OPTION AT THAT POINT WOULD BE

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:54.055 region:rollup2
THE HOSPITAL.

01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:56.157 region:rollup2
FLORA SOMEBODY WHO HAS TRAVELLED

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:57.993 region:rollup2
AROUND THE AREA FRESNO TO THE

01:29:56.157 --> 01:29:59.394 region:rollup2
RULE OUTLYING AREAS. WHERE THESE

01:29:57.993 --> 01:30:00.428 region:rollup2
NEW CLINICS HAVE POPPED UP TO

01:29:59.394 --> 01:30:02.030 region:rollup2
SERVE THE NEEDS OF THOSE

01:30:00.428 --> 01:30:03.465 region:rollup2
PATIENTS OUT IN THOSE AREAS I

01:30:02.030 --> 01:30:05.233 region:rollup2
CAN TELL YOU THAT THOSE CLINICS

01:30:03.465 --> 01:30:06.034 region:rollup2
THOSE COUNTRY CLINICS?

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:08.103 region:rollup2
ARE LIFESAVING FOR THOSE

01:30:06.034 --> 01:30:10.071 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

01:30:08.103 --> 01:30:11.673 region:rollup2
THEY IMAGINE IF THEY HAD TO

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:13.174 region:rollup2
DRIVE AN EXTRA THIRTY FORTY FIVE

01:30:11.673 --> 01:30:14.542 region:rollup2
MILES AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS

01:30:13.174 --> 01:30:15.644 region:rollup2
HAD TO DRIVE THEM THEY WOULD

01:30:14.542 --> 01:30:17.112 region:rollup2
MISS TREATMENTS. INCREASE RISK

01:30:15.644 --> 01:30:19.080 region:rollup2
OF DEATH.

01:30:17.112 --> 01:30:21.049 region:rollup2
SO THOSE RULE OUTLYING CLINICS

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:22.384 region:rollup2
ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND I FEAR

01:30:21.049 --> 01:30:24.219 region:rollup2
THOSE TO BE THE ONES MOST

01:30:22.384 --> 01:30:26.154 region:rollup2
AFFECTED BY THIS BY EITHER

01:30:24.219 --> 01:30:26.688 region:rollup2
CLOSING OR LOWERING SHIFTS.

01:30:26.154 --> 01:30:28.556 region:rollup2
OR WHAT NOT WHICH WOULD BE

01:30:26.688 --> 01:30:29.791 region:rollup2
DISASTROUS.

01:30:28.556 --> 01:30:30.592 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE IT COULD CREATE A

01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:32.394 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN

01:30:30.592 --> 01:30:33.762 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:30:32.394 --> 01:30:36.231 region:rollup2
OTHER UNITS I CAN TELL YOU CAN

01:30:33.762 --> 01:30:38.066 region:rollup2
NOT ABSORB PATIENTS THAT DO NOT

01:30:36.231 --> 01:30:39.701 region:rollup2
HAVE A PLACE TO DIE LIES. AND AS

01:30:38.066 --> 01:30:41.670 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE EMERGENCY ROOMS ARE

01:30:39.701 --> 01:30:43.271 region:rollup2
ALREADY PASSED THEIR CAPACITY.

01:30:41.670 --> 01:30:44.706 region:rollup2
IT'S CLEAR WHILE THE PHYSICIANS

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:45.940 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN A

01:30:44.706 --> 01:30:47.575 region:rollup2
POSITION ON THIS MEASURE HAVE A

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:49.244 region:rollup2
POST.

01:30:47.575 --> 01:30:51.279 region:rollup2
THE RENO POSITIONS ASSOCIATION

01:30:49.244 --> 01:30:53.548 region:rollup2
OPPOSES AMERICAN COLLEGE OF

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:54.416 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS OPPOSES

01:30:53.548 --> 01:30:56.184 region:rollup2
COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETIES WE ALL

01:30:54.416 --> 01:30:57.452 region:rollup2
OPPOSE.

01:30:56.184 --> 01:30:59.421 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK OF MY PATIENTS AS

01:30:57.452 --> 01:31:00.188 region:rollup2
POLITICAL PAWNS.

01:30:59.421 --> 01:31:05.627 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S PRETTY

01:31:00.188 --> 01:31:07.662 region:rollup2
IRRESPONSIBLE TO DO SO.

01:31:05.627 --> 01:31:09.297 region:rollup2
THEY THESE ARE PEOPLE THEY HAVE

01:31:07.662 --> 01:31:10.265 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFICULT LIVES

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:11.967 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME

01:31:10.265 --> 01:31:13.368 region:rollup2
EVERYDAY.

01:31:11.967 --> 01:31:14.135 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THIS PROPOSAL WOULD

01:31:13.368 --> 01:31:19.674 region:rollup2
BE VERY DANGEROUS TO THEM.

01:31:14.135 --> 01:31:21.009 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:31:19.674 --> 01:31:21.910 region:rollup2

SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA.

01:31:31.119 --> 01:31:34.789 region:rollup2
OUR MEMBERS PROBABLY PROVIDE

HIGH QUALITY COMPASSIONATE CARE

CALIFORNIANS WHO DEPEND ON

01:31:37.559 --> 01:31:41.196 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS TO STAY ALIVE.

01:31:40.061 --> 01:31:43.164 region:rollup2
EVERY COMPANY THAT PROVIDES

01:31:41.196 --> 01:31:44.933 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS IN CALIFORNIA ALONG

01:31:43.164 --> 01:31:45.800 region:rollup2
WITH THE DIALYSIS COUNCIL ARE

01:31:44.933 --> 01:31:47.836 region:rollup2
STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BALLOT

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:48.570 region:rollup2
MEASURE.

01:31:47.836 --> 01:31:50.472 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY

01:31:48.570 --> 01:31:51.639 region:rollup2
DEVASTATING.

01:31:50.472 --> 01:31:53.375 region:rollup2
AND SHADOW THE DIALYSIS PROVIDER

01:31:51.639 --> 01:31:55.310 region:rollup2
NETWORK.

01:31:53.375 --> 01:31:56.878 region:rollup2
SIMPLY PUT THIS INITIATIVE WOULD

01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:58.646 region:rollup2
MAKE THE BUSINESS OF OPERATING

01:31:56.878 --> 01:31:59.147 region:rollup2
OUTPATIENT DIALYSIS CLINICS IN

01:31:58.646 --> 01:32:02.384 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ECONOMICALLY

01:31:59.147 --> 01:32:03.184 region:rollup2
UNVIABLE.

01:32:02.384 --> 01:32:04.519 region:rollup2
AND THAT WOULD BE VERY

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:06.087 region:rollup2
DISASTROUS FOR THE SIXTY SIX

01:32:04.519 --> 01:32:07.088 region:rollup2
THOUSAND PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA

01:32:06.087 --> 01:32:09.424 region:rollup2
WHO DEPEND ON DIALYSIS TO STAY

01:32:07.088 --> 01:32:10.759 region:rollup2
ALIVE.

01:32:09.424 --> 01:32:12.727 region:rollup2
IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS INITIATIVE

01:32:10.759 --> 01:32:15.063 region:rollup2
WAS WRITTEN BY PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:32:12.727 --> 01:32:16.231 region:rollup2
UNFAMILIAR WITH OUR INDUSTRY.

01:32:15.063 --> 01:32:17.799 region:rollup2
THE INITIATIVE RATCHETS DOWN

01:32:16.231 --> 01:32:18.600 region:rollup2
WHAT DIALYSIS COMPANIES CAN

01:32:17.799 --> 01:32:20.135 region:rollup2
CHARGE PRIVATE INSURANCE

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:21.903 region:rollup2
COMPANIES TWO HUNDRED AND

01:32:20.135 --> 01:32:23.671 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN PERCENT OF WHAT THE

01:32:21.903 --> 01:32:25.974 region:rollup2
PROPONENTS HAVE DEFINED. AS

01:32:23.671 --> 01:32:28.276 region:rollup2
PATIENT CARE SERVICES COSTS.

01:32:25.974 --> 01:32:29.878 region:rollup2
HOWEVER. THESE ALLOWABLE CHARGES

01:32:28.276 --> 01:32:31.579 region:rollup2
FAILED TO ACCOUNT FOR MANY OF

01:32:29.878 --> 01:32:33.081 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANT EXPENSES NECESSARY

01:32:31.579 --> 01:32:34.282 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY PATIENT

01:32:33.081 --> 01:32:35.984 region:rollup2
CARE.

01:32:34.282 --> 01:32:37.285 region:rollup2
FOR INSTANCE

01:32:35.984 --> 01:32:38.553 region:rollup2
THE INITIATIVE SPECIFICALLY

01:32:37.285 --> 01:32:40.021 region:rollup2
PREVENTS CLINICS FROM BILLING

MANAGERIAL STAFF AND OTHER

01:32:41.923 --> 01:32:45.894 region:rollup2
CRITICAL EXPENSES NECESSARY TO

OPERATE A CLINIC.

01:32:45.894 --> 01:32:49.230 region:rollup2
THE INITIATIVE ALSO EXCLUDES THE

01:32:47.462 --> 01:32:50.765 region:rollup2
POSITION MEDICAL DIRECTOR.

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:51.666 region:rollup2

THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR IS

01:32:54.302 --> 01:32:56.971 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING

01:32:55.770 --> 01:32:59.607 region:rollup2
CLINICAL QUALITY AND PATIENT

01:32:56.971 --> 01:33:01.509 region:rollup2

01:32:59.607 --> 01:33:03.478 region:rollup2
IT EXCLUDES NURSE MANAGERS AND

01:33:01.509 --> 01:33:04.579 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES WHO HELP PATIENTS

01:33:03.478 --> 01:33:06.681 region:rollup2
NAVIGATE THE FINANCIAL AND

PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY CARE.

01:33:09.884 --> 01:33:13.421 region:rollup2
IT MAKES NO SENSE.

01:33:12.087 --> 01:33:15.190 region:rollup2

ANALYSIS OF THIS BALLOT MEASURE.

01:33:23.765 --> 01:33:26.701 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT THE

01:33:24.866 --> 01:33:28.703 region:rollup2
MEASURE WOULD LITERALLY SHATTER

01:33:26.701 --> 01:33:32.240 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY? BOTH FOR

01:33:28.703 --> 01:33:34.142 region:rollup2
PROFIT AND NONPROFIT PROVIDERS.

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:35.410 region:rollup2
FOR STARTERS THIS INITIATIVE SO

01:33:34.142 --> 01:33:37.812 region:rollup2
CALLED PATIENT SERVICES COSTS

01:33:35.410 --> 01:33:39.781 region:rollup2
ONLY ACCOUNT FOR ON AVERAGE

01:33:37.812 --> 01:33:40.715 region:rollup2
SIXTY NINE PERCENT OF THE COST

01:33:39.781 --> 01:33:43.318 region:rollup2
OF OPERATING A CLINIC IN

01:33:40.715 --> 01:33:45.386 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:33:43.318 --> 01:33:47.188 region:rollup2
MOST STARTLING ACCORDING TO

01:33:45.386 --> 01:33:48.857 region:rollup2
THEIR INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS IF

01:33:47.188 --> 01:33:50.325 region:rollup2
THIS INITIATIVE WERE TO PASS.

01:33:48.857 --> 01:33:51.126 region:rollup2
EIGHTY THREE PERCENT OF CLINICS

01:33:50.325 --> 01:33:53.928 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE NEGATIVE OPERATING

01:33:51.126 --> 01:33:55.396 region:rollup2
MARGINS.

01:33:53.928 --> 01:33:55.930 region:rollup2
AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ARE

01:33:55.396 --> 01:33:58.333 region:rollup2
SPREAD ACROSS ALL PROVIDER

01:33:55.930 --> 01:34:00.802 region:rollup2
TYPES.

01:33:58.333 --> 01:34:02.670 region:rollup2
FOR PROFITS NONPROFITS AND RULE

01:34:00.802 --> 01:34:04.105 region:rollup2
CLINICS URBAN CLINICS CLINICS

01:34:02.670 --> 01:34:06.641 region:rollup2
WITH HIGH PERCENT OF MEDICAL AND

01:34:04.105 --> 01:34:07.041 region:rollup2
MEDICARE.

01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:08.409 region:rollup2
THIS INITIATIVE IS

01:34:07.041 --> 01:34:09.777 region:rollup2
INDISCRIMINATE.

01:34:08.409 --> 01:34:11.012 region:rollup2
IT WOULD EQUALLY CRUSH ALL

01:34:09.777 --> 01:34:12.146 region:rollup2
MANNER IN TYPES OF DIALYSIS

01:34:11.012 --> 01:34:14.048 region:rollup2
CLINICS.

01:34:12.146 --> 01:34:16.317 region:rollup2
LET'S BE CLEAR.

01:34:14.048 --> 01:34:18.353 region:rollup2
IT'S MY IF MOST OR EVEN SOME OF

01:34:16.317 --> 01:34:20.255 region:rollup2
THE CLINICS WERE FORCED TO CLOSE

01:34:18.353 --> 01:34:21.689 region:rollup2
OR CUT BACK OPERATIONS BECAUSE

01:34:20.255 --> 01:34:23.791 region:rollup2
THE INITIATIVE. IT WOULD BE

01:34:21.689 --> 01:34:25.159 region:rollup2
DEVASTATING FOR PATIENTS.

01:34:23.791 --> 01:34:26.895 region:rollup2
THEY NEED FOR DIALYSIS IS

01:34:25.159 --> 01:34:28.429 region:rollup2
GROWING AT ABOUT FIVE PERCENT A

01:34:26.895 --> 01:34:29.931 region:rollup2
YEAR IN CALIFORNIA.

01:34:28.429 --> 01:34:30.832 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE HAD A HARD TIME AS IT

01:34:29.931 --> 01:34:32.367 region:rollup2
IS KEEPING UP WITH THE DEMAND

01:34:30.832 --> 01:34:33.635 region:rollup2
TODAY.

01:34:32.367 --> 01:34:36.538 region:rollup2
THE CLOSURE OF CLINICS WOULD BE

01:34:33.635 --> 01:34:37.605 region:rollup2
A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS.

01:34:36.538 --> 01:34:39.374 region:rollup2
PATIENTS WOULD BE FORCED TO

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:40.775 region:rollup2
TREAT IN THE HOSPITAL OR BE

01:34:39.374 --> 01:34:41.643 region:rollup2
PUSHED INTO EMERGENCY ROOMS DUE

01:34:40.775 --> 01:34:43.578 region:rollup2
TO COMPLICATIONS FROM MISSING

01:34:41.643 --> 01:34:44.979 region:rollup2
TREATMENTS.

01:34:43.578 --> 01:34:46.147 region:rollup2
OUR INDUSTRY WILL WORK HARD TO

01:34:44.979 --> 01:34:48.016 region:rollup2
EDUCATE THE VOTERS AND DEFEAT

01:34:46.147 --> 01:34:49.450 region:rollup2
THIS MEASURE.

01:34:48.016 --> 01:34:50.652 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF IT PASSES IT WOULD BE

01:34:49.450 --> 01:34:52.687 region:rollup2
DEVASTATING FOR THE PATIENTS.

01:34:50.652 --> 01:34:54.155 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:34:52.687 --> 01:34:56.624 region:rollup2
A MUCH.

01:34:54.155 --> 01:34:58.359 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

01:34:56.624 --> 01:35:03.831 region:rollup2
COMING.

01:34:58.359 --> 01:35:06.034 region:rollup2
HERNANDEZ.

01:35:03.831 --> 01:35:07.368 region:rollup2
SO.

01:35:06.034 --> 01:35:09.337 region:rollup2
I DON'T DISAGREE THAT.

01:35:07.368 --> 01:35:10.405 region:rollup2
I THINK THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST

01:35:09.337 --> 01:35:12.006 region:rollup2
PRIORITY OF OUR HEALTHCARE

01:35:10.405 --> 01:35:13.975 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS TO MAKE SURE NUMBER

01:35:12.006 --> 01:35:16.578 region:rollup2
ONE WE HAVE ACCESS.

01:35:13.975 --> 01:35:19.147 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO THE MOST VULNERABLE

01:35:16.578 --> 01:35:20.615 region:rollup2
ACCESS AND RURAL INNER CITY.

01:35:19.147 --> 01:35:22.083 region:rollup2
AND I THAT'S SERVICE SEEMS TO BE

01:35:20.615 --> 01:35:23.484 region:rollup2
ENDEMIC OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE

01:35:22.083 --> 01:35:25.019 region:rollup2
IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM PERIOD

01:35:23.484 --> 01:35:26.421 region:rollup2
I MEAN.

01:35:25.019 --> 01:35:27.288 region:rollup2
WE JUST HAVE DOCTORS THAT DON'T

01:35:26.421 --> 01:35:29.023 region:rollup2
TAKE MEDI CAL ON THERE. IT

01:35:27.288 --> 01:35:30.658 region:rollup2
CENTRO.

01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:32.660 region:rollup2
SO THAT I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IF I

01:35:30.658 --> 01:35:34.529 region:rollup2
REALLY FELT THAT THIS INITIATIVE

01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:36.731 region:rollup2
WOULD GO IN THE OPPOSITE

01:35:34.529 --> 01:35:38.433 region:rollup2
DIRECTION AYE WHEN SUPPORTIVE

01:35:36.731 --> 01:35:39.767 region:rollup2
BUT I I DON'T SEE THAT AND THEN.

01:35:38.433 --> 01:35:41.035 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING TOO IS I KEEP

01:35:39.767 --> 01:35:41.703 region:rollup2
HEARING REPEATING PATIENTS

01:35:41.035 --> 01:35:44.973 region:rollup2
AGAINST.

01:35:41.703 --> 01:35:46.507 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:35:44.973 --> 01:35:49.444 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY A END THAT. AN

01:35:46.507 --> 01:35:50.945 region:rollup2
ENTITY IS TRYING TO ORGANIZE.

01:35:49.444 --> 01:35:52.480 region:rollup2
SO HERE'S AND I DON'T KNOW HIM

01:35:50.945 --> 01:35:54.115 region:rollup2
AND HAVE A QUESTION YET BUT HERE

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:56.084 region:rollup2
HERE'S SOME NOT.

01:35:54.115 --> 01:35:56.684 region:rollup2
I DECIDE I'M JUST EVER COLLIDED

01:35:56.084 --> 01:35:58.186 region:rollup2
STATEMENTS I THINK YOU NEED TO

01:35:56.684 --> 01:35:59.621 region:rollup2
MAKE RIGHT NOW.

01:35:58.186 --> 01:36:00.388 region:rollup2
AND BESIDES GONNA VOTE IN ON

01:35:59.621 --> 01:36:01.456 region:rollup2
THIS BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE

01:36:00.388 --> 01:36:02.657 region:rollup2
THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE THAT

01:36:01.456 --> 01:36:04.459 region:rollup2
ALREADY GOING TO VOTE AND THEN

01:36:02.657 --> 01:36:05.660 region:rollup2
THAT ENOUGH SIGNATURES HAVE BEEN

01:36:04.459 --> 01:36:07.295 region:rollup2
GATHERING AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE

01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:09.130 region:rollup2
DOING OUR DUE DILIGENCE TO MAKE

01:36:07.295 --> 01:36:10.164 region:rollup2
SURE THERE'S. KIND OF ALL THE

01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:11.833 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IS OUT THERE.

01:36:10.164 --> 01:36:14.669 region:rollup2
BOB BUT HERE HERE'S THE CONCERN

01:36:11.833 --> 01:36:17.105 region:rollup2
THAT I HAVE.

01:36:14.669 --> 01:36:19.007 region:rollup2
THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS WE

01:36:17.105 --> 01:36:20.842 region:rollup2
HAVE AN EXTREMELY ROBUST HEALTH

01:36:19.007 --> 01:36:24.345 region:rollup2
CARE SYSTEM.

01:36:20.842 --> 01:36:26.347 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

01:36:24.345 --> 01:36:28.149 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOW BECOMING.

01:36:26.347 --> 01:36:31.219 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATED.

01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:33.187 region:rollup2
AND I'VE SEEN VERY VERY SMART SO

01:36:31.219 --> 01:36:33.855 region:rollup2
IN NUMEROUS MARKETS

01:36:33.187 --> 01:36:36.090 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE GETTING

01:36:33.855 --> 01:36:37.725 region:rollup2
MONOPOLIZATION.

01:36:36.090 --> 01:36:38.793 region:rollup2
WE HAVE WOMEN OPPOSITIONS AND

01:36:37.725 --> 01:36:39.861 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL SYSTEMS HERE IN

01:36:38.793 --> 01:36:41.262 region:rollup2
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE

01:36:39.861 --> 01:36:42.463 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ARE CAUSING A

01:36:41.262 --> 01:36:43.698 region:rollup2
LOT MORE THAN SOUTHERN

01:36:42.463 --> 01:36:45.533 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:36:43.698 --> 01:36:46.634 region:rollup2
AND WHEN YOU HAVE TO ENTITIES

01:36:45.533 --> 01:36:48.302 region:rollup2
ARE PRETTY MUCH DOMINATE THE

01:36:46.634 --> 01:36:49.537 region:rollup2
MARKET I CAN VERY EASILY SEE

01:36:48.302 --> 01:36:50.505 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN HAVE A MOP

01:36:49.537 --> 01:36:53.374 region:rollup2
MONOPOLIZATION.

01:36:50.505 --> 01:36:55.576 region:rollup2
SO.

01:36:53.374 --> 01:36:57.412 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM THAT I SEE IS THAT

01:36:55.576 --> 01:37:00.014 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HAVE THAT AND YOU ARE

01:36:57.412 --> 01:37:01.049 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE HAVING HIGH COST.

01:37:00.014 --> 01:37:02.216 region:rollup2
THERE ARE GOING TO BE PASSED ON

01:37:01.049 --> 01:37:04.252 region:rollup2
TO THE CONSUMER MARKET.

01:37:02.216 --> 01:37:05.486 region:rollup2
WELL GUESS WHAT.

01:37:04.252 --> 01:37:06.621 region:rollup2
GUESS WHO THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:07.622 region:rollup2
THE STATEMENT I MADE EARLY IT'S

01:37:06.621 --> 01:37:09.057 region:rollup2
GOING TO AFFECT THE OVERALL

01:37:07.622 --> 01:37:11.893 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE MARKET IN THE

01:37:09.057 --> 01:37:14.362 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS THAT WE ALL PAY FOR.

01:37:11.893 --> 01:37:15.697 region:rollup2
IF YOU THINK ABOUT.

01:37:14.362 --> 01:37:17.231 region:rollup2
THE SUCCESS THAT WE'VE HAD IN

01:37:15.697 --> 01:37:18.733 region:rollup2
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HERE IN

01:37:17.231 --> 01:37:20.234 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

01:37:18.733 --> 01:37:21.803 region:rollup2
WHEN I SPEAK TO COVER CALIFORNIA

01:37:20.234 --> 01:37:23.538 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN BY

01:37:21.803 --> 01:37:26.074 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS.

01:37:23.538 --> 01:37:27.709 region:rollup2
IN THIS STATE IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:37:26.074 --> 01:37:29.177 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT THEIR NARROW NETWORKS

01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:30.278 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT. WHAT DO YOU THINK IT

01:37:29.177 --> 01:37:31.012 region:rollup2
IS IT'S THE COST OF THEIR HEALTH

01:37:30.278 --> 01:37:32.980 region:rollup2
CARE?

01:37:31.012 --> 01:37:34.248 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:36.684 region:rollup2
KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT EIGHTY

01:37:34.248 --> 01:37:38.086 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF YOUR PATIENTS ARE THE

01:37:36.684 --> 01:37:39.520 region:rollup2
PATIENT DIALYSIS CLINICS ARE

01:37:38.086 --> 01:37:40.655 region:rollup2
MEDICARE WELL GUESS WHAT THE

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:42.223 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO

01:37:40.655 --> 01:37:44.192 region:rollup2
SET THE PRICES.

01:37:42.223 --> 01:37:46.194 region:rollup2
AND I'VE WHENEVER I SPEAK TO

01:37:44.192 --> 01:37:47.762 region:rollup2
LARGE GROUPS OR ENTITIES

01:37:46.194 --> 01:37:49.030 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO BE A

01:37:47.762 --> 01:37:49.931 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE CONTROL

01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:51.599 region:rollup2
COSTS BECAUSE OF WE DON'T

01:37:49.931 --> 01:37:53.234 region:rollup2
CONTROL COST GUESS WHAT THE

01:37:51.599 --> 01:37:54.602 region:rollup2
CONSUMER IS GOING TO CONTROL

01:37:53.234 --> 01:37:55.703 region:rollup2
THEM FOR YOU.

01:37:54.602 --> 01:37:57.271 region:rollup2
IN THE FORMER WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:37:55.703 --> 01:38:01.075 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THE INITIATIVE.

01:37:57.271 --> 01:38:02.944 region:rollup2
SYSTEM SO. YOU KNOW I.

01:38:01.075 --> 01:38:03.644 region:rollup2
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN

01:38:02.944 --> 01:38:05.646 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO LEASE HAVE

01:38:03.644 --> 01:38:07.281 region:rollup2
A SERIOUS CONVERSATION JUST IN

01:38:05.646 --> 01:38:09.484 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE THERE WAS A BILL

01:38:07.281 --> 01:38:09.984 region:rollup2
THAT CAME THROUGH. THAT'S

01:38:09.484 --> 01:38:11.386 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH THE ENTIRE

01:38:09.984 --> 01:38:13.020 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

01:38:11.386 --> 01:38:14.589 region:rollup2
AND I BELIEVE THAT IT'S THE

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:15.757 region:rollup2
PUBLIC THAT'S THE POINT OF.

01:38:14.589 --> 01:38:17.892 region:rollup2
WHERE WE NEED TO START HAVING

01:38:15.757 --> 01:38:19.861 region:rollup2
SOME SERIOUS CONVERSATIONS?

01:38:17.892 --> 01:38:20.128 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN LET ME JUST I THINK

01:38:19.861 --> 01:38:22.530 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS.

01:38:20.128 --> 01:38:23.965 region:rollup2
.

01:38:22.530 --> 01:38:25.333 region:rollup2
MISS FOR A I THINK YOU MADE A

01:38:23.965 --> 01:38:26.501 region:rollup2
STATEMENT EARLIER ABOUT

01:38:25.333 --> 01:38:27.935 region:rollup2
EXCLUDING MEDICAL DIRECTORS OF

01:38:26.501 --> 01:38:29.537 region:rollup2
ON A MISTAKE I THINK SENATE I

01:38:27.935 --> 01:38:31.105 region:rollup2
MEAN DOCTOR WOULD SUMMER WOULD

01:38:29.537 --> 01:38:33.374 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN ASKED A QUESTION

01:38:31.105 --> 01:38:34.575 region:rollup2
EARLIER AND I THINK IT WAS

01:38:33.374 --> 01:38:35.843 region:rollup2
ANSWERED AND UP.

01:38:34.575 --> 01:38:37.945 region:rollup2
IT WHAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT

01:38:35.843 --> 01:38:39.180 region:rollup2
WAS EXCLUDED.

01:38:37.945 --> 01:38:41.015 region:rollup2
ALL RIGHTS INCLUDED WITHIN THE

01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:42.917 region:rollup2
HOUR.

01:38:41.015 --> 01:38:44.952 region:rollup2
GOVERNING ENTITY SO IT IS THAT

01:38:42.917 --> 01:38:46.287 region:rollup2
INCORRECT OR NOT.

01:38:44.952 --> 01:38:47.922 region:rollup2
WELL IT'S OUR INTERPRETATION

01:38:46.287 --> 01:38:50.224 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE. IT

01:38:47.922 --> 01:38:52.026 region:rollup2
SAID THAT IT SHALL INCLUDE ONLY

01:38:50.224 --> 01:38:55.029 region:rollup2
NON MANAGERIAL.

01:38:52.026 --> 01:38:56.898 region:rollup2
STAFF AND THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR

01:38:55.029 --> 01:38:58.699 region:rollup2
IS A MANAGERIAL STAFF ALONG WITH

01:38:56.898 --> 01:39:00.134 region:rollup2
THE NURSE MANAGER CLINIC

01:38:58.699 --> 01:39:01.102 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATOR. OKAY WE DON'T

01:39:00.134 --> 01:39:02.870 region:rollup2
REALLY KNOW THAT WE WILL NOT

01:39:01.102 --> 01:39:04.806 region:rollup2
COME UP AND CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE

01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:06.474 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'VE GOT A. RESPONSE

01:39:04.806 --> 01:39:08.709 region:rollup2
FROM THE PROPONENTS OF HOW

01:39:06.474 --> 01:39:09.610 region:rollup2
DURING THE AMENDMENT PROCESS

01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:25.193 region:rollup2
THAT THEY TRY TO ADDRESS THIS.

01:39:09.610 --> 01:39:25.793 region:rollup2
SO.

01:39:25.193 --> 01:39:26.761 region:rollup2
YES THANK YOU AGAIN.

01:39:25.793 --> 01:39:30.932 region:rollup2
JOHN ALLEN FOR THE CA YOU YOU

01:39:26.761 --> 01:39:32.633 region:rollup2
HW. AND YES IT IS IT IS OUR.

01:39:30.932 --> 01:39:34.235 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION OF THE INITIATIVE

01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:35.770 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE WRITTEN THAT MEDICAL

01:39:34.235 --> 01:39:39.173 region:rollup2
DIRECTORS WOULD.

01:39:35.770 --> 01:39:40.408 region:rollup2
BE INCLUDED AS AS PATIENT CARE.

01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:42.176 region:rollup2
IN I WOULD JUST SAY I THINK AS

01:39:40.408 --> 01:39:43.444 region:rollup2
THAT ELIOT STATED EARLIER THAT

01:39:42.176 --> 01:39:45.179 region:rollup2
STILL SOMETHING THAT'S OPEN TO

01:39:43.444 --> 01:39:46.781 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION SO I I I DON'T

01:39:45.179 --> 01:39:48.349 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT THERE'S. A

01:39:46.781 --> 01:39:49.217 region:rollup2
DEFINITIVE ANSWER TO THAT.

01:39:48.349 --> 01:39:50.284 region:rollup2
I THINK THE LA OVER.

01:39:49.217 --> 01:39:51.986 region:rollup2
POINTED OUT IN THEIR

01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:53.754 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION EARLIER. THAT IT

01:39:51.986 --> 01:39:56.757 region:rollup2
REALLY DOES DEPEND ON WHO IS

01:39:53.754 --> 01:39:58.493 region:rollup2
INCLUDED AND ARE READING OF THE

01:39:56.757 --> 01:39:59.026 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE THAT IS CURRENTLY.

01:39:58.493 --> 01:40:00.194 region:rollup2
GONNA BE PROPOSED FOR THE

01:39:59.026 --> 01:40:01.062 region:rollup2
BALLOT.

01:40:00.194 --> 01:40:02.530 region:rollup2
IS THAT IT'S NON MANAGERIAL

01:40:01.062 --> 01:40:03.130 region:rollup2
STAFF.

01:40:02.530 --> 01:40:04.699 region:rollup2
ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE

01:40:03.130 --> 01:40:06.567 region:rollup2
INCLUDED SO MAYBE YOU CAN WORK

01:40:04.699 --> 01:40:08.870 region:rollup2
WITH THE PROPONENTS A FIX THAT

01:40:06.567 --> 01:40:10.137 region:rollup2
IN THE INITIATIVE PROCESS.

01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:11.405 region:rollup2
I THINK IS A LITTLE TOO LATE FOR

01:40:10.137 --> 01:40:14.375 region:rollup2
THAT I A GLOBAL LANGUAGE IS

01:40:11.405 --> 01:40:15.142 region:rollup2
ALREADY IN THE PAST. VIA.

01:40:14.375 --> 01:40:16.477 region:rollup2
LET ME WHICH MAKE THIS

01:40:15.142 --> 01:40:19.514 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE BETTER SO THAT WE CAN

01:40:16.477 --> 01:40:20.848 region:rollup2
INCLUDE.

01:40:19.514 --> 01:40:22.183 region:rollup2
BUT I I THINK THE PROBLEM NOW IS

01:40:20.848 --> 01:40:23.951 region:rollup2
THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN IN IT AND

01:40:22.183 --> 01:40:25.286 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY THE LANGUAGE AS

01:40:23.951 --> 01:40:28.122 region:rollup2
AND THE INITIATIVE NOW.

01:40:25.286 --> 01:40:28.789 region:rollup2
DOES EXCLUDE THOSE EXTRA COSTS

01:40:28.122 --> 01:40:30.024 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE

01:40:28.789 --> 01:40:31.225 region:rollup2
PROBLEM AS TO WHY IN OUR

01:40:30.024 --> 01:40:32.326 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS.

01:40:31.225 --> 01:40:33.628 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA HAVE SUCH A

01:40:32.326 --> 01:40:35.296 region:rollup2
DEVASTATING IMPACT ON THE

01:40:33.628 --> 01:40:36.564 region:rollup2
CLINICS IS BECAUSE THERE ARE SO

01:40:35.296 --> 01:40:39.300 region:rollup2
MANY OTHER STAFF MEMBERS THAT

01:40:36.564 --> 01:40:41.736 region:rollup2
ARE REQUIRED BY CMS THAT ARE NOT

01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:44.305 region:rollup2
INCLUDED. IN THIS COST ANALYSIS

01:40:41.736 --> 01:40:45.206 region:rollup2
SO LET'S SAY ASSUMING WE WORD

01:40:44.305 --> 01:40:46.941 region:rollup2
THAT WEREN'T THE CASE AND THERE

01:40:45.206 --> 01:40:48.142 region:rollup2
WAS A MINOR AMOUNT TO SEE

01:40:46.941 --> 01:40:49.677 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT STAFF.

01:40:48.142 --> 01:40:50.544 region:rollup2
AND LET'S SAY WERE ADDRESS DO

01:40:49.677 --> 01:40:52.146 region:rollup2
YOU REALLY BELIEVE DO YOU

01:40:50.544 --> 01:40:53.848 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT A FIFTEEN PERCENT

01:40:52.146 --> 01:40:55.082 region:rollup2
PROFIT BILLY MARGINS FOR ALL

01:40:53.848 --> 01:40:56.717 region:rollup2
ENTITIES IS FAIR.

01:40:55.082 --> 01:40:58.486 region:rollup2
I THINK THE DIFFICULTY AGAIN IS

01:40:56.717 --> 01:40:59.854 region:rollup2
ON HOW YOU DEFINE IT AND I THINK

01:40:58.486 --> 01:41:01.689 region:rollup2
THAT'S A PROBLEM THERE ARE SO

01:40:59.854 --> 01:41:03.758 region:rollup2
MANY OTHER STAFF MEMBERS AND IT

01:41:01.689 --> 01:41:04.258 region:rollup2
DEPENDS ON EACH CLINIC. AND I

01:41:03.758 --> 01:41:05.092 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S PART OF THE

01:41:04.258 --> 01:41:07.361 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:41:05.092 --> 01:41:08.763 region:rollup2
AGAIN AS A LA O. EXPLAINED I

01:41:07.361 --> 01:41:10.965 region:rollup2
MEAN THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:41:08.763 --> 01:41:13.034 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNMENT ENTITIES.

01:41:10.965 --> 01:41:14.669 region:rollup2
YES SO THE OVERALL GOVERNING AND

01:41:13.034 --> 01:41:17.171 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY OF A.

01:41:14.669 --> 01:41:18.606 region:rollup2
LET'S SAY A PARTICULAR GROUP

01:41:17.171 --> 01:41:19.807 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S FISTS FOR SENDING

01:41:18.606 --> 01:41:21.575 region:rollup2
OUT OR.

01:41:19.807 --> 01:41:23.477 region:rollup2
DE VITA.

01:41:21.575 --> 01:41:24.211 region:rollup2
THE THE OVERALL PROFITABILITY

01:41:23.477 --> 01:41:25.479 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD HE BE ABLE TO ALLOW

01:41:24.211 --> 01:41:26.781 region:rollup2
THAT ENTITY SO I GUESS THE

01:41:25.479 --> 01:41:28.849 region:rollup2
QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU OF THOSE

01:41:26.781 --> 01:41:30.217 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS WERE. WORSE A FEISTY

01:41:28.849 --> 01:41:31.218 region:rollup2
WITH THE MANAGERIAL STAFF

01:41:30.217 --> 01:41:33.387 region:rollup2
EXCLUDING MEDICAL DIRECTOR

01:41:31.218 --> 01:41:34.855 region:rollup2
INCLUDING MEDICAL DIRECTORS

01:41:33.387 --> 01:41:36.390 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES ETCETERA.

01:41:34.855 --> 01:41:38.960 region:rollup2
DO YOU BELIEVE A FIFTEEN PERCENT

01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:40.194 region:rollup2
MARGIN OF PROFITABILITY IS FAIR.

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:42.129 region:rollup2
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE FAIR

01:41:40.194 --> 01:41:45.700 region:rollup2
AMOUNT WOULD BE AMENDED AGAIN IT

01:41:42.129 --> 01:41:47.001 region:rollup2
WOULD DEPEND ON WHAT IS INCLUDED

01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:47.535 region:rollup2
IN THE EYES OF A LEVERAGES

01:41:47.001 --> 01:41:49.403 region:rollup2
FOR THREE TO FOUR TO FIVE

01:41:47.535 --> 01:41:51.539 region:rollup2
PERCENT. YEAH I WOULD HAVE KNOW

01:41:49.403 --> 01:41:52.573 region:rollup2
IDEA WHAT NUMBER DID PAIN AGAIN

01:41:51.539 --> 01:41:54.375 region:rollup2
ON THE DEFINITION OF WHO YOU

01:41:52.573 --> 01:41:56.110 region:rollup2
INCLUDED AND EACH SPECIFIC

01:41:54.375 --> 01:41:57.478 region:rollup2
CLINIC I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WHAT

01:41:56.110 --> 01:41:59.447 region:rollup2
NUMBER WOULD BE. SETTLED ON TO

01:41:57.478 --> 01:42:01.015 region:rollup2
BE FAIR.

01:41:59.447 --> 01:42:01.549 region:rollup2
FAIR ENOUGH THOSE STATEMENTS AND

01:42:01.015 --> 01:42:03.417 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN

GO.

01:42:17.698 --> 01:42:20.267 region:rollup2
I'VE HAD FAMILY MEMBERS ARE ON

01:42:18.666 --> 01:42:22.069 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS.

01:42:20.267 --> 01:42:23.838 region:rollup2
IN FACT FIRST DIALYSIS STEPS

01:42:22.069 --> 01:42:25.172 region:rollup2
PLEASED TO HAVE IN THE NINETEEN

01:42:23.838 --> 01:42:26.273 region:rollup2
SIXTIES WHEN SHE IS ONE OF THE

01:42:25.172 --> 01:42:28.642 region:rollup2
VERY FIRST.

01:42:26.273 --> 01:42:31.846 region:rollup2
AND I JUST REMEMBER AND I'VE

01:42:28.642 --> 01:42:33.848 region:rollup2
SEEN PEOPLE DIED. CENTERS THEIR

01:42:31.846 --> 01:42:35.583 region:rollup2
VERY FRAIL. AND THE FARTHER THE

01:42:33.848 --> 01:42:37.518 region:rollup2
DISTANCE THEY ARE THAT THEY HAVE

01:42:35.583 --> 01:42:39.086 region:rollup2
TO DRIVE AFTER TREATMENT MAKES

01:42:37.518 --> 01:42:41.489 region:rollup2
ME CRINGE.

01:42:39.086 --> 01:42:42.056 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SMOOTH RIDE

ND TO MAKE THAT ANY FARTHER

01:42:44.158 --> 01:42:47.728 region:rollup2
THAN SOME OF THESE ARE. DOUBTS

01:42:45.793 --> 01:42:49.430 region:rollup2
WERE I COME FROM ON THIS IS

01:42:47.728 --> 01:42:50.097 region:rollup2

SOMETHING OUT BECAUSE IT JUST

01:42:55.469 --> 01:42:58.773 region:rollup2
SEEMS LIKE.

OF THEIR ROLE GOING WANTING TO

01:42:58.773 --> 01:43:01.142 region:rollup2
GO THE SAME DIRECTION THAT WE'VE

01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:02.243 region:rollup2
GOT A FEW THINGS WE NEED TO

01:43:01.142 --> 01:43:04.645 region:rollup2
CLEAN UP BUT.

01:43:02.243 --> 01:43:07.748 region:rollup2
HIS INITIAL PROCESS I DON'T KNOW

01:43:04.645 --> 01:43:10.518 region:rollup2
UP TO SET THE TABLE. POUNDED OUT

01:43:07.748 --> 01:43:13.387 region:rollup2
BUT MUCH RATHER SEE THAT.

01:43:10.518 --> 01:43:14.689 region:rollup2
SENATOR.

01:43:13.387 --> 01:43:16.090 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER SO A QUESTION

FOR MS FOISTED.

01:43:16.090 --> 01:43:19.293 region:rollup2
JUST TO TOUCH ON SOMETHING THAT

01:43:17.591 --> 01:43:21.929 region:rollup2
SEND HERNANDEZ. MENTIONED

01:43:19.293 --> 01:43:24.498 region:rollup2
REGARDING CONSOLIDATION AND AND

01:43:21.929 --> 01:43:26.100 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU WOULD. I'M IT'S NOT

01:43:24.498 --> 01:43:27.935 region:rollup2
OFTEN YOU SEE OTHERWISE VERY

01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:30.571 region:rollup2
PROBABLE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE

01:43:27.935 --> 01:43:31.138 region:rollup2
THAT CONSOLIDATED MUST THERE ARE

01:43:30.571 --> 01:43:31.572 region:rollup2
SERIOUS BARRIERS TO ENTRY SO

01:43:31.138 --> 01:43:32.740 region:rollup2
COULD YOU.

01:43:31.572 --> 01:43:33.841 region:rollup2
AND REALLY SIMPLISTIC TERMS CAN

01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:35.743 region:rollup2
YOU EXPLAIN.

01:43:33.841 --> 01:43:37.078 region:rollup2
Y. THE DIALYSIS INDUSTRY IS HAS

01:43:35.743 --> 01:43:38.112 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATED TO THE POINT WHERE

01:43:37.078 --> 01:43:39.747 region:rollup2
THERE'S REALLY ONLY TWO MAJOR

01:43:38.112 --> 01:43:40.815 region:rollup2
PLAYERS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:43:39.747 --> 01:43:42.483 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU ONE OF THE MAJOR

01:43:40.815 --> 01:43:45.052 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS WITH ENTRY INTO THE

01:43:42.483 --> 01:43:46.854 region:rollup2
MARKET IS BUILDING A NEW UNIT.

01:43:45.052 --> 01:43:48.789 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST IF YOU WANT TO COME

01:43:46.854 --> 01:43:50.257 region:rollup2
INTO CALIFORNIA AND BUILD A NEW

01:43:48.789 --> 01:43:51.992 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS CLINIC YOU NEED TO

01:43:50.257 --> 01:43:52.893 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY. FIND A PIECE OF

01:43:51.992 --> 01:43:54.929 region:rollup2
PROPERTY.

01:43:52.893 --> 01:43:56.564 region:rollup2
BUILDING AT LEAST SET WHATEVER

01:43:54.929 --> 01:43:58.499 region:rollup2
PAY FOR THAT HIGHER ALL YOUR

01:43:56.564 --> 01:44:00.434 region:rollup2
STAFF IT ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT IN

01:43:58.499 --> 01:44:01.836 region:rollup2
PLACE AND THEN YOU HAVE TO WAIT

01:44:00.434 --> 01:44:03.571 region:rollup2
FOR BOTH LICENSE SCENE BY THE

01:44:01.836 --> 01:44:05.206 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND

01:44:03.571 --> 01:44:08.175 region:rollup2
THEN ALSO FOR CERTIFICATION

01:44:05.206 --> 01:44:09.977 region:rollup2
THROUGH CMS AND UNFORTUNATELY.

01:44:08.175 --> 01:44:11.479 region:rollup2
THAT SEEM INTO THE DEPARTMENT

01:44:09.977 --> 01:44:13.514 region:rollup2
OF PUBLIC HEALTH ALSO HAS

01:44:11.479 --> 01:44:15.382 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT OVER NURSING HOMES AND

01:44:13.514 --> 01:44:17.618 region:rollup2
THEY'RE AT A HIGHER TIER. AND SO

01:44:15.382 --> 01:44:19.153 region:rollup2
THEY GET SURVEYED AND THEY.

01:44:17.618 --> 01:44:20.821 region:rollup2
HOW THE STAFF GO OUT THERE

01:44:19.153 --> 01:44:22.389 region:rollup2
FIRST SO WE'RE KIND OF AT THE

01:44:20.821 --> 01:44:23.958 region:rollup2
BOTTOM OF THE WAITING LIST? AND

01:44:22.389 --> 01:44:25.793 region:rollup2
SO THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN THAT

01:44:23.958 --> 01:44:28.362 region:rollup2
THAT FACILITY HAS TO SIT THERE

01:44:25.793 --> 01:44:29.597 region:rollup2
FULLY OPERATIONAL WAITING. AND

01:44:28.362 --> 01:44:31.532 region:rollup2
SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF

01:44:29.597 --> 01:44:33.501 region:rollup2
CAPITAL IN ORDER TO HAVE THAT IN

01:44:31.532 --> 01:44:35.336 region:rollup2
PLACE BECAUSE IT TAKES ON

01:44:33.501 --> 01:44:36.971 region:rollup2
AVERAGE MONTHS TO JUST GET YOUR

01:44:35.336 --> 01:44:38.506 region:rollup2
INITIAL LICENSING. AND THEN

01:44:36.971 --> 01:44:41.375 region:rollup2
AFTER YOU HAVE YOUR LIST INITIAL

01:44:38.506 --> 01:44:42.776 region:rollup2
LICENSING ONLY AT THAT POINT CAN

01:44:41.375 --> 01:44:45.346 region:rollup2
YOU THEN REQUEST YOUR CMS

01:44:42.776 --> 01:44:47.081 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION. AND FOR YEARS AND

01:44:45.346 --> 01:44:48.749 region:rollup2
YEARS NOW IT'S BEEN A MINIMUM OF

01:44:47.081 --> 01:44:51.285 region:rollup2
TWELVE MONTHS THAT YOU HAVE TO

01:44:48.749 --> 01:44:51.652 region:rollup2
SIT AND WAIT FOR YOUR CMS

01:44:51.285 --> 01:44:53.087 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION.

01:44:51.652 --> 01:44:54.588 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU CANNOT START SEEING

01:44:53.087 --> 01:44:56.123 region:rollup2
THOSE PATIENTS UNTIL YOU GET

01:44:54.588 --> 01:44:56.891 region:rollup2
THAT CERTIFICATION SO YOU

01:44:56.123 --> 01:44:58.926 region:rollup2
LITERALLY HAVE TO HAVE ENOUGH

01:44:56.891 --> 01:45:00.461 region:rollup2
CAPITAL HEARING CALIFORNIA TO

01:44:58.926 --> 01:45:02.296 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT FACILITY ALL OF YOUR

01:45:00.461 --> 01:45:04.632 region:rollup2
STAFF IS BEING PAID ALL OF YOUR

01:45:02.296 --> 01:45:06.133 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT IN PLACE. FOR UPWARDS

01:45:04.632 --> 01:45:08.169 region:rollup2
OF TWELVE MONTHS BEFORE YOU CAN

01:45:06.133 --> 01:45:09.203 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY OPEN.

01:45:08.169 --> 01:45:11.205 region:rollup2
YEAH WE WOULD THAT ALSO BE TRUE

01:45:09.203 --> 01:45:13.407 region:rollup2
OF IF YOU KNOW OTHER KIND OF CAP

01:45:11.205 --> 01:45:15.242 region:rollup2
ATTENTIVE. MEDICAL THOSE SECTORS

01:45:13.407 --> 01:45:16.977 region:rollup2
LIKE SURGICAL CARE CENTERS IS IT

01:45:15.242 --> 01:45:19.980 region:rollup2
THAT DIFFERENT WHAT WHY WHEN OUR

01:45:16.977 --> 01:45:21.582 region:rollup2
SPITTLE IS ALSO INVEST. IN OUT.

01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:22.583 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW I'M JUST A DOCTOR I

01:45:21.582 --> 01:45:23.717 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW A LOT OF THIS ARE NOT

01:45:22.583 --> 01:45:26.120 region:rollup2
JUST A DOCTOR ALL THIS

01:45:23.717 --> 01:45:27.755 region:rollup2
GOBBLEDYGOOK BUT AND I CAN TELL

01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:29.590 region:rollup2
YOU AGAIN FROM EXPERIENCE AND.

01:45:27.755 --> 01:45:31.358 region:rollup2
WHEN I WHEN I FIRST MOVED TO

01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:32.359 region:rollup2
FRESNO THERE WERE MULTIPLE

01:45:31.358 --> 01:45:34.295 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COMPANIES

01:45:32.359 --> 01:45:35.396 region:rollup2
AND THEY WERE SMALL INDEPENDENT

01:45:34.295 --> 01:45:37.064 region:rollup2
COMPANIES THAT MANAGED THESE

01:45:35.396 --> 01:45:37.698 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS UNITS.

01:45:37.064 --> 01:45:39.500 region:rollup2
AND.

01:45:37.698 --> 01:45:41.168 region:rollup2
THEY WERE VERY POORLY RUN

01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:42.703 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE WERE NOT PROTOCOLS

01:45:41.168 --> 01:45:44.305 region:rollup2
THEY CAME CENTRALIZED ON HOW TO

01:45:42.703 --> 01:45:46.340 region:rollup2
TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS.

01:45:44.305 --> 01:45:47.875 region:rollup2
AND WHEN WE IT WAS BROUGHT UP

01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:49.877 region:rollup2
THAT SOME OF THESE PATIENTS.

01:45:47.875 --> 01:45:51.779 region:rollup2
OPERATE IN THE RED YOU NEED TO

01:45:49.877 --> 01:45:53.113 region:rollup2
HAVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF OTHER

01:45:51.779 --> 01:45:54.682 region:rollup2
CLINICS IT AS SOME OF THE I'M

01:45:53.113 --> 01:45:56.383 region:rollup2
SORRY CLINICS OPERATED THE RED

01:45:54.682 --> 01:45:58.118 region:rollup2
YOU NEED TO HAVE A LOT OF THEM.

01:45:56.383 --> 01:46:00.020 region:rollup2
TO OFFSET SOME OF THE MORE RURAL

01:45:58.118 --> 01:46:01.689 region:rollup2
AREAS WHERE ALL THE PATIENTS ARE

01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:02.856 region:rollup2
MEDICARE OR MEDICARE OR WHATEVER

01:46:01.689 --> 01:46:04.692 region:rollup2
AND YOU JUST YOU DON'T MAKE

01:46:02.856 --> 01:46:05.793 region:rollup2
MONEY. THAT THESE THESE PLACES

01:46:04.692 --> 01:46:07.861 region:rollup2
ARE NOT MAKING MONEY. AND SO

01:46:05.793 --> 01:46:10.097 region:rollup2
THEY HAD YOU KNOW ONE OR TWO

01:46:07.861 --> 01:46:12.633 region:rollup2
UNITS IN FRESNO THEY WERE A

01:46:10.097 --> 01:46:14.401 region:rollup2
POORLY RUN AND AGAIN BECAUSE IT

01:46:12.633 --> 01:46:16.403 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAVE AN ORGANIZED.

01:46:14.401 --> 01:46:17.838 region:rollup2
SNOW TEAM OF DOCTORS AT THE

01:46:16.403 --> 01:46:19.640 region:rollup2
HEAD OF THE CORPORATION THAT

01:46:17.838 --> 01:46:21.275 region:rollup2
SENT DOWN SOME OF THE. THEM

01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:21.475 region:rollup2
DETAILS ON HOW TO MANAGE SOME OF

01:46:21.275 --> 01:46:23.344 region:rollup2
THE.

01:46:21.475 --> 01:46:25.613 region:rollup2
THAT THE PATIENTS AND NUMBER

01:46:23.344 --> 01:46:26.914 region:rollup2
TWO. THE PURCHASING POWER THE

01:46:25.613 --> 01:46:29.183 region:rollup2
OPERATING CLINICS THAT WERE IN

01:46:26.914 --> 01:46:30.718 region:rollup2
POOR AREAS AND THE NEEDING OTHER

01:46:29.183 --> 01:46:31.585 region:rollup2
CLINICS TO OFFSET THAT. SO

01:46:30.718 --> 01:46:33.187 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST SOME OF THE

01:46:31.585 --> 01:46:34.221 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE THAT I SAW INITIALLY

01:46:33.187 --> 01:46:37.091 region:rollup2
WHEN I WHEN I CAME HERE AND THEY

01:46:34.221 --> 01:46:38.726 region:rollup2
WERE. BASICALLY CONVERTED THOSE

01:46:37.091 --> 01:46:40.227 region:rollup2
THOSE DIALYSIS UNITS WERE

01:46:38.726 --> 01:46:41.328 region:rollup2
CONVERTED TO LARGER COMPANIES.

01:46:40.227 --> 01:46:42.630 region:rollup2
CHUCK PREACHER THAT'S A DOCTOR

01:46:41.328 --> 01:46:44.498 region:rollup2
DOCTOR CHEN.

01:46:42.630 --> 01:46:45.933 region:rollup2
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT MOST A

01:46:44.498 --> 01:46:48.168 region:rollup2
PHRENOLOGIST IN CALIFORNIA.

01:46:45.933 --> 01:46:50.070 region:rollup2
ARE ALSO CONCERT IN MOSTLY

01:46:48.168 --> 01:46:51.472 region:rollup2
WORKING EITHER FOR WITH THE TWO

01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:53.874 region:rollup2
MAJOR COMPANIES IS THAT CORRECT

01:46:51.472 --> 01:46:55.109 region:rollup2
I KNOW SO I AM A MEDICAL

01:46:53.874 --> 01:46:57.745 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR BECAUSE.

01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:59.280 region:rollup2
CMS REQUIRES THAT ALL OF THE

01:46:57.745 --> 01:47:01.749 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS UNITS HAVE A MEDICAL

01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:03.250 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR. SO IN FRESNO IF YOU'RE

01:47:01.749 --> 01:47:04.351 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE WORTH YOUR SALT AND

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:05.819 region:rollup2
YOU BASICALLY OUR MEDICAL

01:47:04.351 --> 01:47:07.354 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR IS BECAUSE EVERY UNIT

01:47:05.819 --> 01:47:09.590 region:rollup2
NEEDS ONE.

01:47:07.354 --> 01:47:11.558 region:rollup2
I AM NOT IT I DON'T OWN ANY

01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:13.260 region:rollup2
PART OF THE DIALYSIS FACILITIES

01:47:11.558 --> 01:47:14.795 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER MOST

01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:16.430 region:rollup2
NEPHROLOGIST HAVE PART SHARE.

01:47:14.795 --> 01:47:18.232 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT THE

01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:20.601 region:rollup2
NEPHROLOGIST THAT I WORK WITH.

01:47:18.232 --> 01:47:21.735 region:rollup2
MY PARTNER AND WE ALSO HAVE SOME

01:47:20.601 --> 01:47:23.270 region:rollup2
SOLO PEOPLE THAT WE.

ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE BUSINESS

01:47:24.838 --> 01:47:27.875 region:rollup2
OF THE UNITS SHOULD IN YOUR CASE

01:47:26.573 --> 01:47:29.343 region:rollup2
HAS CENTER MISS FOR IT WOULD

01:47:27.875 --> 01:47:30.144 region:rollup2
GENERALLY SPEAKING ACROSS THE

01:47:29.343 --> 01:47:32.947 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY.

01:47:30.144 --> 01:47:35.449 region:rollup2
WHAT EXTEND TO WHAT EXTENT DO

01:47:32.947 --> 01:47:36.016 region:rollup2
DOCTORS HAVE A DEBATE AN EQUITY

01:47:35.449 --> 01:47:37.618 region:rollup2
INTEREST IN

01:47:36.016 --> 01:47:40.187 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS CLINICS

01:47:37.618 --> 01:47:41.755 region:rollup2
I WOULDN'T KNOW ANY PERCENTAGE?

01:47:40.187 --> 01:47:43.891 region:rollup2
OF THAT OF ANY EIGHT BIGGER

01:47:41.755 --> 01:47:44.625 region:rollup2
SMALL KIND OF VARIES.

01:47:43.891 --> 01:47:46.660 region:rollup2
THE BIG DISMAL.

01:47:44.625 --> 01:47:48.896 region:rollup2
.

01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:50.764 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW I

01:47:48.896 --> 01:47:51.966 region:rollup2
WOULD I I MEAN AGAIN I WHICH I

01:47:50.764 --> 01:47:53.367 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY SMALL VIA MY WITH A

01:47:51.966 --> 01:47:55.169 region:rollup2
SMALL.

01:47:53.367 --> 01:47:55.736 region:rollup2
NURSE BE DIFFERENT THAN MY

01:47:55.169 --> 01:47:58.739 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING BUT THANK YOU

01:47:55.736 --> 01:48:00.174 region:rollup2
CLAIMS CHECK.

01:47:58.739 --> 01:48:00.441 region:rollup2
THE GODS HAVE COUPLE COUPLE

01:48:00.174 --> 01:48:02.242 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

01:48:00.441 --> 01:48:03.143 region:rollup2
.

01:48:02.242 --> 01:48:04.645 region:rollup2
AND THIS ON ON BALANCE.

01:48:03.143 --> 01:48:06.480 region:rollup2
.

01:48:04.645 --> 01:48:06.980 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT IN WHAT PERCENT OF

01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:08.415 region:rollup2
THE HEALTHCARE DOLLAR IS

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:09.249 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY.

01:48:08.415 --> 01:48:11.652 region:rollup2
FOR PROFIT.

01:48:09.249 --> 01:48:13.454 region:rollup2
AND HOW MUCH IS REINVESTED IN

01:48:11.652 --> 01:48:15.155 region:rollup2
PATIENT CARE MEANWHILE SEE THE

01:48:13.454 --> 01:48:16.790 region:rollup2
PROFIT BUT IS THERE ARE YOU KNOW

01:48:15.155 --> 01:48:18.258 region:rollup2
IS THERE IN INDUSTRY PHILOSOPHY

01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:19.827 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW. HOW MUCH IS

01:48:18.258 --> 01:48:21.995 region:rollup2
REINVESTED BACK INTO INTO

01:48:19.827 --> 01:48:22.629 region:rollup2
PATIENT CARE?

01:48:21.995 --> 01:48:24.264 region:rollup2
AND HOW HOW DOES THAT WORK IN

01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:25.733 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY. I WOULD SAY AGAIN

01:48:24.264 --> 01:48:28.268 region:rollup2
LIKE I'VE I POINTED OUT EARLIER

01:48:25.733 --> 01:48:29.737 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO BUILD A NEW FACILITY

01:48:28.268 --> 01:48:30.838 region:rollup2
IT'S A VERY LARGE INVESTMENT.

01:48:29.737 --> 01:48:32.439 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE IT

01:48:30.838 --> 01:48:33.941 region:rollup2
UP AND RUNNING FOR UPWARDS OF

01:48:32.439 --> 01:48:35.242 region:rollup2
TWELVE MONTHS SO THERE'S A LOT

01:48:33.941 --> 01:48:37.411 region:rollup2
OF INVESTMENT IN THAT.

01:48:35.242 --> 01:48:39.046 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY

01:48:37.411 --> 01:48:42.049 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A GROWING

01:48:39.046 --> 01:48:43.684 region:rollup2
POPULATION OF PATIENTS AND THAT

01:48:42.049 --> 01:48:45.552 region:rollup2
ARE BECOMING. IN IN MEDIAN

01:48:43.684 --> 01:48:47.121 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS TREATMENT AND SO THERE

01:48:45.552 --> 01:48:49.656 region:rollup2
IS A LARGE INVESTMENT.

01:48:47.121 --> 01:48:51.492 region:rollup2
THERE HAS BEEN IN THE PAST.

01:48:49.656 --> 01:48:52.092 region:rollup2
IN BEING ABLE TO START UP NEW

01:48:51.492 --> 01:48:53.927 region:rollup2
FACILITIES IN AREAS THAT NEED

01:48:52.092 --> 01:48:55.662 region:rollup2
IT.

01:48:53.927 --> 01:48:59.033 region:rollup2
IF THAT WILL CONTINUE AFTER THIS

01:48:55.662 --> 01:48:59.666 region:rollup2
PASSES IT'S VERY HARD TO SAY.

01:48:59.033 --> 01:49:01.201 region:rollup2
MY PLEASURE MORE INTERESTED IN

01:48:59.666 --> 01:49:03.637 region:rollup2
THE ON THAT PUT PUT NEW

01:49:01.201 --> 01:49:05.773 region:rollup2
FACILITIES DECIDE WHAT IS HOW

01:49:03.637 --> 01:49:07.141 region:rollup2
MUCH IS REINVESTED IN ENSURING

01:49:05.773 --> 01:49:08.242 region:rollup2
THAT PATIENTS ARE GETTING THE

01:49:07.141 --> 01:49:09.843 region:rollup2
HIGHEST QUALITY CARE THAT WAS

01:49:08.242 --> 01:49:10.878 region:rollup2
REALLY MORE MY QUESTION YEAH AND

01:49:09.843 --> 01:49:11.979 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN THERE'S A LOT OF

01:49:10.878 --> 01:49:12.846 region:rollup2
ADVANCEMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY

01:49:11.979 --> 01:49:15.015 region:rollup2
BEING MADE THERE'S LOT. OF

01:49:12.846 --> 01:49:16.450 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS ALL THE MACHINES

01:49:15.015 --> 01:49:18.352 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS

01:49:16.450 --> 01:49:20.254 region:rollup2
FOR PATIENTS I MEAN AND PATIENTS

01:49:18.352 --> 01:49:21.755 region:rollup2
CAN DIE LIES IN THE FACILITY OR

01:49:20.254 --> 01:49:22.956 region:rollup2
THEY CAN ALSO VIOLATES AT HOME.

01:49:21.755 --> 01:49:24.291 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S CONSTANTLY

01:49:22.956 --> 01:49:26.360 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS BEING MADE IN TRYING

01:49:24.291 --> 01:49:28.962 region:rollup2
TO PRODUCE NEW MACHINES TO HELP

01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:31.665 region:rollup2
WITH THAT PROCESS. SO I THINK

01:49:28.962 --> 01:49:32.232 region:rollup2
THAT'S A NEW TECHNOLOGY IS A LOT

01:49:31.665 --> 01:49:32.966 region:rollup2
OF AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE THE

01:49:32.232 --> 01:49:33.634 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT ALSO.

01:49:32.966 --> 01:49:35.669 region:rollup2
SO YES I GUESS I'M TRYING TO GET

01:49:33.634 --> 01:49:37.738 region:rollup2
IS IT IS THERE A PAY PHILOSOPHY

01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:39.473 region:rollup2
OF A.

01:49:37.738 --> 01:49:41.408 region:rollup2
MEDICAL LOSS RATIO ASSOCIATED

01:49:39.473 --> 01:49:43.043 region:rollup2
WITH WHICH TO WORK.

01:49:41.408 --> 01:49:44.344 region:rollup2
THERE'D DEBT THERE'S.

01:49:43.043 --> 01:49:45.712 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO NUMBER THERE'S NO

01:49:44.344 --> 01:49:47.381 region:rollup2
NUMBER ASSOCIATED THAT MEANS NO

01:49:45.712 --> 01:49:49.016 region:rollup2
PHILOSOPHY AROUND THAT I I DON'T

01:49:47.381 --> 01:49:50.083 region:rollup2
KNOW ANY SPECIFIC NUMBER IT IT

01:49:49.016 --> 01:49:51.452 region:rollup2
JUST DEPENDS ON.

01:49:50.083 --> 01:49:52.586 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY WANT TO MAKE THE

01:49:51.452 --> 01:49:55.522 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT IT EFFORTS IN

01:49:52.586 --> 01:49:56.023 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS OR AND

01:49:55.522 --> 01:49:58.058 region:rollup2
WORKING ON NEW TREATMENT

01:49:56.023 --> 01:49:59.927 region:rollup2
PROTOCOLS? WOULD BE SPECIFIC TO

01:49:58.058 --> 01:50:00.828 region:rollup2
EACH COMPANY.

01:49:59.927 --> 01:50:02.162 region:rollup2
YOU MENTIONED A STUDY.

01:50:00.828 --> 01:50:03.864 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SHARE

01:50:02.162 --> 01:50:04.865 region:rollup2
THAT WITH OUR COMMITTEE STAFF.

01:50:03.864 --> 01:50:07.301 region:rollup2
SURE I DON' BELIEVE IT'S

THAT.

01:50:47.074 --> 01:50:50.644 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED. IN

01:50:48.475 --> 01:50:52.379 region:rollup2
THE COST.

01:50:50.644 --> 01:50:54.148 region:rollup2
SO IF A PATIENT I MEAN CAN A

01:50:52.379 --> 01:50:55.816 region:rollup2

CAN HELP THE PATIENTS AND.

01:51:13.066 --> 01:51:15.636 region:rollup2
THAT IS A DIFFICULT PART THAT.

01:51:15.402 --> 01:51:17.838 region:rollup2
IT IS.

01:51:15.636 --> 01:51:20.374 region:rollup2
VERY LIMITED ON WHAT IS

01:51:17.838 --> 01:51:22.009 region:rollup2
INCLUDED IN THAT COST TO DO THE

01:51:20.374 --> 01:51:23.577 region:rollup2
CALCULATION.

01:51:22.009 --> 01:51:25.646 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:51:23.577 --> 01:51:28.015 region:rollup2
OKAY SO.

01:51:25.646 --> 01:51:29.716 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ISSUE HARM.

01:51:28.015 --> 01:51:31.518 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THERE'S PATIENTS WHO

01:51:29.716 --> 01:51:33.987 region:rollup2
COME IN AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY.

01:51:31.518 --> 01:51:36.223 region:rollup2
DO THEIR DIALYSIS AT HOME.

01:51:33.987 --> 01:51:37.891 region:rollup2
A IN THE EVENINGS.

01:51:36.223 --> 01:51:39.860 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE TRAINED YOU KNOW

01:51:37.891 --> 01:51:41.161 region:rollup2
AGAINST TO THE CLINIC.

01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:42.062 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN THEY COME

01:51:41.161 --> 01:51:44.298 region:rollup2
INTO THE CLINIC.

01:51:42.062 --> 01:51:46.700 region:rollup2
.

01:51:44.298 --> 01:51:48.168 region:rollup2
HOW WAS THAT AFFECTED IN THE

01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:50.037 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE OUR IS IT IS LOOKING

01:51:48.168 --> 01:51:51.672 region:rollup2
LIKE THIS?

01:51:50.037 --> 01:51:54.074 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGED THAT STILL OR

01:51:51.672 --> 01:51:55.742 region:rollup2
AFFECTED IN ANY WAY IS COVERED

01:51:54.074 --> 01:51:57.211 region:rollup2
ON THE THE COST CAP WAS.

01:51:55.742 --> 01:51:59.079 region:rollup2
YES ARE RIGHTS ARE UNDERSTANDING

01:51:57.211 --> 01:52:00.614 region:rollup2
THAT THE HOME CARE IS INCLUDED

01:51:59.079 --> 01:52:02.716 region:rollup2
AS A PART OF IT SO AGAIN.

01:52:00.614 --> 01:52:03.684 region:rollup2
BANG THERE'S THAT DIFFICULTY

01:52:02.716 --> 01:52:05.719 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT AT THE

01:52:03.684 --> 01:52:06.954 region:rollup2
COST.

01:52:05.719 --> 01:52:08.789 region:rollup2
IT ONLY IS.

01:52:06.954 --> 01:52:10.457 region:rollup2
WHAT SPECIFICALLY LISTED IT

01:52:08.789 --> 01:52:13.093 region:rollup2
SAYS SHALL INCLUDE ONLY AND THE

01:52:10.457 --> 01:52:15.262 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING AND NON MANAGERIAL?

01:52:13.093 --> 01:52:16.797 region:rollup2
CRIED DALLAS'S CLINIC IN STAFF

01:52:15.262 --> 01:52:18.599 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS

01:52:16.797 --> 01:52:20.167 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE OTHER STAFF THAT

01:52:18.599 --> 01:52:21.802 region:rollup2
DO WORK WITH PATIENTS AND ASSIST

01:52:20.167 --> 01:52:25.038 region:rollup2
WITH OTHER PARTS OF THEIR CARE

01:52:21.802 --> 01:52:26.840 region:rollup2
THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE COST.

01:52:25.038 --> 01:52:28.508 region:rollup2

THEY'RE DOING AT HOME DIALYSIS

01:52:33.413 --> 01:52:38.785 region:rollup2

IS ALWAYS ON CALL. LIGHT AND

01:52:44.458 --> 01:52:45.626 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO.

01:52:44.791 --> 01:52:47.594 region:rollup2
.

01:52:45.626 --> 01:52:49.596 region:rollup2
SUPPORT WITH TYPICALLY THAT THE

01:52:47.594 --> 01:52:51.298 region:rollup2
COMPANY THAT MANAGES THE

01:52:49.596 --> 01:52:53.033 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT SO WHAT THAT'S BAXTER

01:52:51.298 --> 01:52:53.800 region:rollup2
OR WHATEVER. SO THERE'S MULTIPLE

01:52:53.033 --> 01:52:56.403 region:rollup2
AREAS.

01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:57.271 region:rollup2
FOR RESOURCE.

01:52:56.403 --> 01:52:59.473 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO.

01:52:57.271 --> 01:53:00.007 region:rollup2
YOU MENTIONED HOME TREATMENTS.

01:52:59.473 --> 01:53:01.408 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:53:00.007 --> 01:53:04.478 region:rollup2
THESE.

01:53:01.408 --> 01:53:07.648 region:rollup2
TO LARGE COMPANIES PROVIDE IS.

01:53:04.478 --> 01:53:10.050 region:rollup2
FREE EDUCATION PRIOR TO

01:53:07.648 --> 01:53:12.119 region:rollup2

DIALYSIS MODALITY INCLUDING

01:53:12.119 --> 01:53:15.088 region:rollup2
TRANSPLANT.

01:53:13.353 --> 01:53:16.857 region:rollup2
AND SO THEY HAVE KIND OF A TEAM

01:53:15.088 --> 01:53:18.025 region:rollup2
THAT'S A COMPLETELY FREE THING

01:53:16.857 --> 01:53:19.593 region:rollup2
TO THE PATIENT.

01:53:18.025 --> 01:53:21.261 region:rollup2
AND THEY CAN HAVE AS MANY

01:53:19.593 --> 01:53:22.696 region:rollup2
SESSIONS AS THEY WANT.

01:53:21.261 --> 01:53:25.198 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY THAT THE PATIENT

01:53:22.696 --> 01:53:27.701 region:rollup2
COMES TO WHATEVER LOCATION THAT

01:53:25.198 --> 01:53:28.568 region:rollup2
THAT TEAM HAS HAS BEEN USING?

01:53:27.701 --> 01:53:30.303 region:rollup2
AND.

01:53:28.568 --> 01:53:32.005 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT LEARNS

01:53:30.303 --> 01:53:33.640 region:rollup2
THE INS AND OUTS OF OF THE TWO

01:53:32.005 --> 01:53:36.243 region:rollup2
TYPES OF HOME TREATMENT THAT YOU

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:38.912 region:rollup2
ALLUDED TO. AS WELL AS DIETARY.

01:53:36.243 --> 01:53:40.414 region:rollup2

TRANSPLANT AND ALL THAT HAPPENS.

01:53:40.414 --> 01:53:43.684 region:rollup2
IN THE PRE DIALYSIS TIME PERIOD

01:53:42.582 --> 01:53:44.985 region:rollup2
SO THAT COULD BE PATIENTS THAT

01:53:43.684 --> 01:53:46.653 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY NEVER MAKE IT TO

01:53:44.985 --> 01:53:48.288 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS ACTUALLY WERE ABLE TO

01:53:46.653 --> 01:53:49.923 region:rollup2
KEEP THEM. YOU KNOW WITH KIDNEY

01:53:48.288 --> 01:53:50.724 region:rollup2
FUNCTION GOOD ENOUGH TO STAY OFF

01:53:49.923 --> 01:53:52.659 region:rollup2
THE MACHINE.

01:53:50.724 --> 01:53:53.994 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S A PREPARATORY THINGS

01:53:52.659 --> 01:53:55.996 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE AND

01:53:53.994 --> 01:53:58.265 region:rollup2
EDUCATION WHICH IS SOMETHING

01:53:55.996 --> 01:54:01.068 region:rollup2
THAT IS PROVIDED TO THEM THREE.

01:53:58.265 --> 01:54:02.169 region:rollup2
AND THROUGH THE COMPANY'S.

01:54:01.068 --> 01:54:03.503 region:rollup2
WHICH ON I DON'T KNOW IF THAT

01:54:02.169 --> 01:54:05.038 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ABLE TO BE CONTINUE

01:54:03.503 --> 01:54:06.139 region:rollup2
THAT'S AN INVESTMENT THAT WAS

01:54:05.038 --> 01:54:08.608 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP BEFORE.

01:54:06.139 --> 01:54:11.945 region:rollup2
THINKING.

01:54:08.608 --> 01:54:13.046 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:54:11.945 --> 01:54:13.213 region:rollup2
I HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION AND

01:54:13.046 --> 01:54:14.047 region:rollup2
AND.

01:54:13.213 --> 01:54:16.149 region:rollup2
.

01:54:14.047 --> 01:54:17.884 region:rollup2
THE.

01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:19.152 region:rollup2
ALL THE START UP COSTS AND AND

01:54:17.884 --> 01:54:21.421 region:rollup2
THE COST TO MAINTAIN A FACILITY

01:54:19.152 --> 01:54:22.422 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING TO LICENSE SEEN ALL

01:54:21.421 --> 01:54:24.424 region:rollup2
THOSE WOULD BE INCLUDED.

01:54:22.422 --> 01:54:27.561 region:rollup2
AS.

01:54:24.424 --> 01:54:29.463 region:rollup2
EXPENSES RELATED TO THE.

01:54:27.561 --> 01:54:30.564 region:rollup2
TO THE CAP.

01:54:29.463 --> 01:54:32.399 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY ARE ATTENTION THAT ANY

01:54:30.564 --> 01:54:33.767 region:rollup2
OF THE COSTS THAT ARE RELATED

01:54:32.399 --> 01:54:35.569 region:rollup2
THEIR TO THAT.

01:54:33.767 --> 01:54:38.338 region:rollup2
RAMPING UP TOWARD A PATIENT

01:54:35.569 --> 01:54:39.673 region:rollup2
CARE WOULD CERTAINLY.

01:54:38.338 --> 01:54:42.242 region:rollup2
BE INCLUDED.

01:54:39.673 --> 01:54:44.411 region:rollup2
FIFTH PATIENT CARE COSTS

01:54:42.242 --> 01:54:45.545 region:rollup2
INCLUDE THE UTILITIES.

01:54:44.411 --> 01:54:46.380 region:rollup2
A FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS.

01:54:45.545 --> 01:54:48.181 region:rollup2
.

01:54:46.380 --> 01:54:50.016 region:rollup2
AND.

01:54:48.181 --> 01:54:52.085 region:rollup2
WE DON'T SEE ANY REQUIREMENT

01:54:50.016 --> 01:54:55.155 region:rollup2
THAT THE CLINICAL READY BE FULLY

01:54:52.085 --> 01:54:57.357 region:rollup2
CMS CERTIFIED BEFORE THOSE COSTS

01:54:55.155 --> 01:55:00.527 region:rollup2
CAN START TO COUNT TOWARD. THE

01:54:57.357 --> 01:55:02.195 region:rollup2
ENTITY LEVEL PATIENT CARE COSTS.

01:55:00.527 --> 01:55:03.196 region:rollup2
SO WE ACTUALLY SEE THIS AS

01:55:02.195 --> 01:55:05.499 region:rollup2
CREATING AN INCENTIVE TO OPEN

01:55:03.196 --> 01:55:07.467 region:rollup2
NEW CLINICS.

01:55:05.499 --> 01:55:09.469 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY AN AREA IN RURAL

01:55:07.467 --> 01:55:10.804 region:rollup2
AREAS OR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

01:55:09.469 --> 01:55:12.773 region:rollup2
WERE OTHERWISE THE ECONOMICS

01:55:10.804 --> 01:55:15.208 region:rollup2
MIGHT NOT HAVE WORKED OUT.

01:55:12.773 --> 01:55:16.676 region:rollup2
BECAUSE NOW WE ARE CREATING THAT

01:55:15.208 --> 01:55:18.245 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO POOL THOSE PATIENT

01:55:16.676 --> 01:55:20.080 region:rollup2
CARE COSTS

01:55:18.245 --> 01:55:22.382 region:rollup2
WITH THE PATIENT CARE COSTS OF

01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:25.585 region:rollup2
FACILITIES IN. AREAS WITH MORE

01:55:22.382 --> 01:55:27.220 region:rollup2
RICH COMMERCIAL PAYER NEXUS.

01:55:25.585 --> 01:55:28.422 region:rollup2
AND SO BECAUSE WE'RE CREATING AN

01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:30.423 region:rollup2
ENTITY WIDE.

01:55:28.422 --> 01:55:32.125 region:rollup2
PAYER MIX POOL.

01:55:30.423 --> 01:55:33.894 region:rollup2
WE'RE HOPING THAT IT ENCOURAGES

01:55:32.125 --> 01:55:38.231 region:rollup2
CLINICS IN RURAL AREAS IN

01:55:33.894 --> 01:55:43.236 region:rollup2
UNDERSERVED AREAS TO OPEN.

01:55:38.231 --> 01:55:43.804 region:rollup2
ANNE JEFFERY COMMENTS ON THE.

01:55:43.236 --> 01:55:45.939 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN I THINK IT'S JUST

01:55:43.804 --> 01:55:46.840 region:rollup2
KIDS.

01:55:45.939 --> 01:55:48.375 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO

01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:49.943 region:rollup2
LOOK AT YOU KNOW ALL THE COSTS

01:55:48.375 --> 01:55:51.511 region:rollup2
ARE INCLUDED IN THERE'S OTHER

01:55:49.943 --> 01:55:52.979 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE'VE MENTIONED.

01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:54.981 region:rollup2
THAT WON'T BE INCLUDED AND OTHER

01:55:52.979 --> 01:55:57.517 region:rollup2
STAFF AND FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL

01:55:54.981 --> 01:55:59.286 region:rollup2
CLINIC ALTHOUGH IT IS LOOKED AT.

01:55:57.517 --> 01:56:00.387 region:rollup2
AS A WHOLE IS A COMPANY. THE

01:55:59.286 --> 01:56:01.822 region:rollup2
COMINGS AND LOOK AT EACH

01:56:00.387 --> 01:56:02.522 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL CLINIC AND WORST

01:56:01.822 --> 01:56:04.224 region:rollup2
LOCATED THAT HAVE TO MAKE A

01:56:02.522 --> 01:56:05.525 region:rollup2
DECISION. YOU KNOW AT THAT

01:56:04.224 --> 01:56:08.595 region:rollup2
CLINIC ITSELF IS ECONOMICALLY

02:21:05.791 --> 02:21:07.926 region:rollup2
MEDICAL NEEDS THAT REQUIRE

02:21:06.925 --> 02:21:10.262 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TREATMENTS FOR

02:21:07.926 --> 02:21:11.263 region:rollup2
NEUROLOGICAL IMPAIRMENTS.

02:21:10.262 --> 02:21:12.230 region:rollup2
THESE TRENDS HAVE MEANT THAT

02:21:11.263 --> 02:21:13.799 region:rollup2
SOME OF OUR HOSPITALS ARE

02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:15.667 region:rollup2
OPERATING AT CLOSE TO CAPACITY

02:21:13.799 --> 02:21:16.868 region:rollup2
FOR MANY MONTHS OF THE YEAR.

02:21:15.667 --> 02:21:18.437 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME THE COST OF

02:21:16.868 --> 02:21:20.138 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL CONSTRUCTION CONTINUES

02:21:18.437 --> 02:21:21.373 region:rollup2
TO INCREASE WHICH MAKES ALL OF

02:21:20.138 --> 02:21:23.709 region:rollup2
THESE NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS IN

02:21:21.373 --> 02:21:24.776 region:rollup2
EXPANSIONS MORE EXPENSIVE.

02:21:23.709 --> 02:21:26.011 region:rollup2
WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR HOSPITAL

02:21:24.776 --> 02:21:27.479 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION COSTS HAVE GROWN BY

02:21:26.011 --> 02:21:28.680 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE PERCENT SINCE TWO

02:21:27.479 --> 02:21:30.382 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND EIGHT. AND THAT

02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:33.051 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION COSTS FOR BETTER

02:21:30.382 --> 02:21:34.086 region:rollup2
NOW ABOUT THREE MILLION DOLLARS.

02:21:33.051 --> 02:21:35.187 region:rollup2
BASED ON THESE TRENDS WE HAVE

02:21:34.086 --> 02:21:36.188 region:rollup2
BUILT A FISCAL ESTIMATE FOR

02:21:35.187 --> 02:21:37.756 region:rollup2
FUTURE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL

02:21:36.188 --> 02:21:39.391 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OVER THE

NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS.

02:21:39.391 --> 02:21:42.494 region:rollup2
THESE INCLUDE FIRST BUILDING

02:21:40.792 --> 02:21:44.162 region:rollup2
CAPACITY IN SPECIALTY AREAS

02:21:42.494 --> 02:21:45.864 region:rollup2
WHERE THE NEED IS GROWING. LIKE

02:21:44.162 --> 02:21:47.632 region:rollup2
CARDIAC LABS FOR CHILDREN WITH

02:21:45.864 --> 02:21:49.134 region:rollup2
CONGENITAL HEART ABNORMALITIES

02:21:47.632 --> 02:21:49.768 region:rollup2
AND OUTPATIENT CLINICS FOR

02:21:49.134 --> 02:21:50.502 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

NEEDS.

02:21:50.502 --> 02:21:53.372 region:rollup2
SO THAT WAIT TIMES FOR SERVICES

02:21:51.536 --> 02:21:55.374 region:rollup2
ARE REDUCED.

02:21:53.372 --> 02:21:55.874 region:rollup2
SECOND ADDING ADDITIONAL BEDS IN

IT WILL ALSO BE USED TO ENSURE

02:22:03.615 --> 02:22:06.318 region:rollup2

MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER.

02:25:44.035 --> 02:25:48.106 region:rollup2
AND THAT SUICIDE IS THE SECOND

02:25:46.071 --> 02:25:49.708 region:rollup2
LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG

CONTINUES TO BE A HUGE PROBLEM.

02:26:08.827 --> 02:26:12.097 region:rollup2
AND YOU ALSO MIGHT SURPRISE BE

02:26:10.729 --> 02:26:13.264 region:rollup2
SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT IT TAKES

02:26:12.097 --> 02:26:14.766 region:rollup2
AN AVERAGE OF TEN YEARS TO

02:26:13.264 --> 02:26:16.368 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSE.

02:26:14.766 --> 02:26:17.369 region:rollup2
A PEDIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH

02:26:16.368 --> 02:26:18.837 region:rollup2
DISORDERS TO WHEN YOU THINK

02:26:17.369 --> 02:26:20.805 region:rollup2
ABOUT IF WE HAD ANY OTHER

02:26:18.837 --> 02:26:22.707 region:rollup2
CHRONIC DISEASE. THAT WE WERE

02:26:20.805 --> 02:26:24.976 region:rollup2
LETTING GO FOR TEN YEARS BEFORE

02:26:22.707 --> 02:26:26.578 region:rollup2
WE IDENTIFIED AND TREATED IT YOU

02:26:24.976 --> 02:26:28.413 region:rollup2
CAN JUST IMAGINE HOW. THESE

02:26:26.578 --> 02:26:29.714 region:rollup2
THINGS BECOME OUT OF CONTROL AND

02:26:28.413 --> 02:26:31.383 region:rollup2
WE WOULD NOT TOLERATE IT WITH

02:26:29.714 --> 02:26:31.916 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER DIAGNOSIS AND WE

02:26:31.383 --> 02:26:33.485 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T TOLERATE IT WITH

02:26:31.916 --> 02:26:35.186 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH.

02:26:33.485 --> 02:26:36.921 region:rollup2
SO THREE YEARS AGO WE LAUNCHED A

02:26:35.186 --> 02:26:38.456 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH

02:26:36.921 --> 02:26:40.025 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE THAT CHALK CHILDREN'S

02:26:38.456 --> 02:26:42.060 region:rollup2
WE STARTED OUT BY CONVENING A

02:26:40.025 --> 02:26:43.828 region:rollup2
LARGE MULTI DISCIPLINARY TASK

02:26:42.060 --> 02:26:45.163 region:rollup2
FORCE FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO

02:26:43.828 --> 02:26:46.865 region:rollup2
ADVISE US AND HELP US SET

02:26:45.163 --> 02:26:48.199 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES.

02:26:46.865 --> 02:26:50.402 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH

02:26:48.199 --> 02:26:52.203 region:rollup2
INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT SERVICES.

02:26:50.402 --> 02:26:53.905 region:rollup2
AND THEN JUST RECENTLY WE OPENED

02:26:52.203 --> 02:26:56.107 region:rollup2
OUR COUNTIES FIRST

02:26:53.905 --> 02:26:57.676 region:rollup2
PEDIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH UNIT WE

02:26:56.107 --> 02:26:59.678 region:rollup2
SERVE CHILDREN BETWEEN AGES

02:26:57.676 --> 02:27:01.012 region:rollup2
THREE AND SEVENTEEN. IT'S AN

02:26:59.678 --> 02:27:02.914 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN BED UNIT WITH ALL

02:27:01.012 --> 02:27:04.182 region:rollup2
PRIVATE ROOMS WE OPENED IT JUST

02:27:02.914 --> 02:27:05.817 region:rollup2
ABOUT THREE OR FOUR WEEKS AGO I

02:27:04.182 --> 02:27:08.386 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY.

02:27:05.817 --> 02:27:10.155 region:rollup2
AND SO WITH THE OPENING OF THIS

02:27:08.386 --> 02:27:11.923 region:rollup2
ITEM WE INCREASE THE CAPACITY

02:27:10.155 --> 02:27:13.224 region:rollup2
FOR OUR STATES.

02:27:11.923 --> 02:27:14.292 region:rollup2
A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR

02:27:13.224 --> 02:27:16.161 region:rollup2
CHILDREN UNDER TWELVE BY

02:27:14.292 --> 02:27:17.395 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN PERCENT.

02:27:16.161 --> 02:27:18.963 region:rollup2
BEFORE THAT THERE WERE ONLY ONE

02:27:17.395 --> 02:27:20.865 region:rollup2
HUNDRED BEDS FOR CHILDREN UNDER

02:27:18.963 --> 02:27:22.634 region:rollup2
TWELVE IN OUR STATE AND WE HAVE

02:27:20.865 --> 02:27:24.569 region:rollup2
SIX MILLION CHILDREN UNDER

02:27:22.634 --> 02:27:25.970 region:rollup2
TWELVE IN OUR STATE.

02:27:24.569 --> 02:27:27.706 region:rollup2
SO I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT WAS NOT

02:27:25.970 --> 02:27:29.541 region:rollup2
ENOUGH SO WAS A BIG DEAL TO OPEN

02:27:27.706 --> 02:27:30.809 region:rollup2
THOSE BEDS.

02:27:29.541 --> 02:27:32.844 region:rollup2
THE FIRST PATIENT WE ADMITTED

02:27:30.809 --> 02:27:34.145 region:rollup2
WAS JUST FIVE YEARS OLD.

02:27:32.844 --> 02:27:35.914 region:rollup2
THAT CHILD HAD BEEN SITTING IN

02:27:34.145 --> 02:27:36.481 region:rollup2
AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR

02:27:35.914 --> 02:27:37.515 region:rollup2
QUITE SOME TIME WAITING FOR

02:27:36.481 --> 02:27:38.717 region:rollup2
CARE.

02:27:37.515 --> 02:27:40.352 region:rollup2
AND THERE WERE REALLY NOT ANY

02:27:38.717 --> 02:27:42.287 region:rollup2
GOOD OPTIONS ON THE HORIZON FOR

02:27:40.352 --> 02:27:43.855 region:rollup2
THAT CHILD SO WE WERE VERY GLAD

02:27:42.287 --> 02:27:45.423 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO OPEN OUR DOORS AND

02:27:43.855 --> 02:27:46.458 region:rollup2
TAKE CARE OF THAT CHILD.

02:27:45.423 --> 02:27:48.493 region:rollup2
SECOND PATIENT WAS ONLY EIGHT

02:27:46.458 --> 02:27:49.994 region:rollup2
YEARS OLD.

02:27:48.493 --> 02:27:51.463 region:rollup2
WE NO THIS UNIT IS GOING TO BE

02:27:49.994 --> 02:27:53.732 region:rollup2
FULL WITHIN MONTHS WE HAD A

02:27:51.463 --> 02:27:54.899 region:rollup2
WAITING LIST WITHIN TWENTY FOUR

02:27:53.732 --> 02:27:56.835 region:rollup2
HOURS OF CHILDREN WHO NEEDED TO

02:27:54.899 --> 02:27:57.836 region:rollup2
GET INTO THE UNIT.

02:27:56.835 --> 02:27:59.437 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW THE NEED IS

02:27:57.836 --> 02:28:01.639 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO GROW.

02:27:59.437 --> 02:28:03.808 region:rollup2
WE ALSO BEGAN SCREENING ALL

02:28:01.639 --> 02:28:05.643 region:rollup2

ALL.

02:28:07.145 --> 02:28:11.349 region:rollup2

ANYTHING AT ALL.

02:28:14.652 --> 02:28:17.822 region:rollup2
OUR STAFF SCREENS THEM TO FIND

02:28:16.321 --> 02:28:19.524 region:rollup2
OUT IF THEY'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING

02:28:17.822 --> 02:28:21.659 region:rollup2
SUICIDAL THOUGHTS IF THEY'VE

02:28:19.524 --> 02:28:23.194 region:rollup2
SUICIDAL IDEATION.

02:28:21.659 --> 02:28:24.896 region:rollup2
STUNNINGLY IN THE FIRST THREE

02:28:23.194 --> 02:28:26.297 region:rollup2
WEEKS THAT WE STARTED CONDUCTING

02:28:24.896 --> 02:28:27.532 region:rollup2
THE SCREENING WE HAD EIGHTY FIVE

02:28:26.297 --> 02:28:30.034 region:rollup2
CHILDREN TELL US THAT THEY HAD

02:28:27.532 --> 02:28:31.903 region:rollup2
BEEN HAVING THESE THOUGHTS.

02:28:30.034 --> 02:28:33.738 region:rollup2
MANY OF THEIR PARENTS WERE

02:28:31.903 --> 02:28:35.106 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY SHOCKED IN FACT MOST

02:28:33.738 --> 02:28:36.641 region:rollup2
OF THEM WERE EXTREMELY SHOCKED

02:28:35.106 --> 02:28:38.009 region:rollup2
AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A TEN TO

02:28:36.641 --> 02:28:39.477 region:rollup2
TWELVE PERCENT POSITIVE

02:28:38.009 --> 02:28:40.945 region:rollup2
SCREENING RATE. AND ARE

02:28:39.477 --> 02:28:41.546 region:rollup2
MERCHANTS THE DEPARTMENT WITH

KIDS WHO WE ASK THAT QUESTION

02:28:41.546 --> 02:28:45.216 region:rollup2
OF.

02:28:43.281 --> 02:28:47.152 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE DONE A LOT BUT WE NEED

02:28:45.216 --> 02:28:49.220 region:rollup2
TO DO MORE AND WE WANT TO DO

02:28:47.152 --> 02:28:51.556 region:rollup2
MORE IN THIS IMPORTANT AREA.

02:28:49.220 --> 02:28:52.724 region:rollup2
WE NEED MORE OUTPATIENT THERAPY

02:28:51.556 --> 02:28:54.692 region:rollup2
WE OPENED AN INTENSIVE

02:28:52.724 --> 02:28:56.394 region:rollup2
OUTPATIENT PROGRAM AND WE FILLED

02:28:54.692 --> 02:28:57.929 region:rollup2
IT UP WITHIN WEEKS THAT PROGRAM

02:28:56.394 --> 02:28:59.631 region:rollup2
IS FOR TEENAGERS WHO ARE

02:28:57.929 --> 02:29:01.065 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING A SERIOUS

02:28:59.631 --> 02:29:02.700 region:rollup2
DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY.

02:29:01.065 --> 02:29:03.902 region:rollup2
WE NEED MORE INPATIENT BEDS WE

02:29:02.700 --> 02:29:05.203 region:rollup2
KNOW WE NEED INPATIENT PSYCH

02:29:03.902 --> 02:29:06.838 region:rollup2
BEDS AND OTHER PARTS OF OUR

02:29:05.203 --> 02:29:09.007 region:rollup2
COUNTY THAT CURRENTLY AREN'T

02:29:06.838 --> 02:29:10.675 region:rollup2
BEING SERVED CLOSE TO HOME.

02:29:09.007 --> 02:29:12.043 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE NEED BETTER SERVICES

02:29:10.675 --> 02:29:14.145 region:rollup2
AND MORE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN

02:29:12.043 --> 02:29:15.647 region:rollup2
WITH AUTISM. WE RECENTLY AND

02:29:14.145 --> 02:29:17.315 region:rollup2
RECEIVED A TEN MILLION DOLLAR

02:29:15.647 --> 02:29:19.117 region:rollup2
LEAD GETS TO OPEN IN NEW AUTISM

02:29:17.315 --> 02:29:20.985 region:rollup2
CENTER A CHALK CHILDREN'S AUTISM

02:29:19.117 --> 02:29:22.787 region:rollup2
CENTER. AND AROUND THE CORNER

02:29:20.985 --> 02:29:25.256 region:rollup2
FROM OUR HOSPITAL. WE KNOW TEN

02:29:22.787 --> 02:29:27.025 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS IS A GREAT START

02:29:25.256 --> 02:29:29.461 region:rollup2
BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE FUNDS

02:29:27.025 --> 02:29:31.396 region:rollup2
TO REALLY OPEN AND EQUIPPED DOT.

02:29:29.461 --> 02:29:32.297 region:rollup2
FACILITY AND WE'RE GONNA NEED TO

02:29:31.396 --> 02:29:34.032 region:rollup2
SURROUND IT WITH OTHER

02:29:32.297 --> 02:29:34.632 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE SERVICES ESPECIALLY

02:29:34.032 --> 02:29:36.768 region:rollup2
FOR CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES

02:29:34.632 --> 02:29:38.636 region:rollup2
OF.

02:29:36.768 --> 02:29:39.904 region:rollup2
I ZERO ONE EIGHT SO CHILDREN UP

02:29:38.636 --> 02:29:41.539 region:rollup2
TO EIGHT THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE

02:29:39.904 --> 02:29:42.540 region:rollup2
THE POST THE BEST CHANCE.

02:29:41.539 --> 02:29:44.742 region:rollup2
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR KIDS

02:29:42.540 --> 02:29:46.411 region:rollup2
WITH AUTISM AND YET THOSE HIGH

02:29:44.742 --> 02:29:48.213 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO THOSE SERVICES IS

02:29:46.411 --> 02:29:50.615 region:rollup2
REALLY AN ADEQUATE AND OUR STATE

02:29:48.213 --> 02:29:52.083 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE EAGER TO DO THAT.

02:29:50.615 --> 02:29:53.218 region:rollup2
SO THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL BOND

02:29:52.083 --> 02:29:54.352 region:rollup2
WOULD REALLY GIVE US A HUGE HEAD

02:29:53.218 --> 02:29:55.987 region:rollup2
START.

02:29:54.352 --> 02:29:57.689 region:rollup2
TO TRY AND MEET ALL THESE NEEDS

02:29:55.987 --> 02:29:59.157 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE NEWMAN AND NUMERATORS

02:29:57.689 --> 02:30:01.025 region:rollup2
WE ALSO NEED.

02:29:59.157 --> 02:30:03.461 region:rollup2
BETTER ACCESS AND MORE ACCESS TO

02:30:01.025 --> 02:30:05.063 region:rollup2
SPECIALTY CARE SERVICES WE NEED

02:30:03.461 --> 02:30:06.865 region:rollup2
MORE ACCESS TO OUTPATIENT

02:30:05.063 --> 02:30:08.566 region:rollup2
SERVICES BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT'S

02:30:06.865 --> 02:30:10.001 region:rollup2
WHERE THE DEMAND IS MOVING. AND

02:30:08.566 --> 02:30:11.269 region:rollup2
WE ALSO NEED TO INVEST IN

02:30:10.001 --> 02:30:13.004 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE

02:30:11.269 --> 02:30:14.739 region:rollup2
GOING TO BRING OUR SERVICES INTO

02:30:13.004 --> 02:30:15.974 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY WHERE AND WHEN

02:30:14.739 --> 02:30:18.076 region:rollup2
FAMILIES NEED THEM AND WANT THEM

02:30:15.974 --> 02:30:19.410 region:rollup2
NOW.

02:30:18.076 --> 02:30:21.145 region:rollup2
AND HIS AND TOLD YOU THE DEMAND

02:30:19.410 --> 02:30:22.881 region:rollup2
FOR SERVICES IS GROWING BUT IT'S

02:30:21.145 --> 02:30:24.549 region:rollup2
A GOOD STORY IT'S A STORY ABOUT

02:30:22.881 --> 02:30:26.184 region:rollup2
SAVING CHILDREN'S LIVES WHEN I

02:30:24.549 --> 02:30:27.819 region:rollup2
STARTED WORKING AT CHOCOLATES

02:30:26.184 --> 02:30:30.188 region:rollup2
AND SAT I REMEMBER.

02:30:27.819 --> 02:30:31.856 region:rollup2
THAT VERY YOUNG KIDS WERE DYING

02:30:30.188 --> 02:30:33.458 region:rollup2
FROM CYSTIC FIBROSIS WE HAD A

02:30:31.856 --> 02:30:35.493 region:rollup2
LOT OF KIDS WHO WOULD DIE FROM

02:30:33.458 --> 02:30:37.695 region:rollup2
LEUKEMIA AND NOW I'VE SEEN THE

02:30:35.493 --> 02:30:38.897 region:rollup2
CURE RATES JUST SKYROCKET.

02:30:37.695 --> 02:30:41.399 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE TAKING CARE OF THESE

02:30:38.897 --> 02:30:43.034 region:rollup2
KIDS THEY NEED ONGOING CARE SO

02:30:41.399 --> 02:30:44.669 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SURVIVING BUT THEY NEED

02:30:43.034 --> 02:30:46.137 region:rollup2
CONTINUING CARE FROM US AND THAT

02:30:44.669 --> 02:30:47.505 region:rollup2
IS ONE REASON WHY THE DEMAND FOR

02:30:46.137 --> 02:30:48.773 region:rollup2
SERVICES IS GROWING.

02:30:47.505 --> 02:30:50.408 region:rollup2
WE'RE ALSO SEEING OTHER

02:30:48.773 --> 02:30:52.877 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS IN THE COMMUNITY

02:30:50.408 --> 02:30:55.046 region:rollup2
RIGHTLY AND IMPORTANTLY FOCUSING

02:30:52.877 --> 02:30:57.682 region:rollup2
ON AGING POPULATION WE SEE A

02:30:55.046 --> 02:30:59.017 region:rollup2
SHIFT OF FOCUS TO CAPACITY FOR

02:30:57.682 --> 02:31:00.585 region:rollup2
THAT GROWING SEGMENT OF AGING

02:30:59.017 --> 02:31:02.287 region:rollup2
ADULTS.

02:31:00.585 --> 02:31:04.255 region:rollup2
AND THEREFORE WE SEE EVEN A

02:31:02.287 --> 02:31:05.323 region:rollup2
GREATER NEED FOR CHILDREN'S

02:31:04.255 --> 02:31:07.091 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS TO BE THERE FOR

02:31:05.323 --> 02:31:08.393 region:rollup2
CHILDREN AND WE WANT TO BE THERE

02:31:07.091 --> 02:31:09.961 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT BEING

02:31:08.393 --> 02:31:11.529 region:rollup2
THERE FOR THEM. BUT WE'RE GOING

02:31:09.961 --> 02:31:13.097 region:rollup2
TO NEED SOME HELP TO DO IT

02:31:11.529 --> 02:31:14.766 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AT CHALK FOR SIXTY FIVE

02:31:13.097 --> 02:31:16.134 region:rollup2
PERCENT NOT A COW AND WE KNOW

02:31:14.766 --> 02:31:18.136 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THERE ON

02:31:16.134 --> 02:31:20.238 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT.

02:31:18.136 --> 02:31:21.873 region:rollup2
SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS WERE

02:31:20.238 --> 02:31:23.942 region:rollup2
ASKING VOTERS TO VOTE YES ON

02:31:21.873 --> 02:31:25.109 region:rollup2
CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS IN NOVEMBER

02:31:23.942 --> 02:31:29.147 region:rollup2

CARDIOLOGISTS OR HIS SURGEON

02:34:05.603 --> 02:34:09.140 region:rollup2
CUTS INTO HIM. MACS THEY HAVE A

02:34:07.572 --> 02:34:10.308 region:rollup2
REALLY CLEAR GAME PLAN AND NOW

IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR THE ONLY

02:34:18.149 --> 02:34:20.718 region:rollup2
OPTION TO REPLACE A PULMONARY

02:34:19.684 --> 02:34:22.420 region:rollup2
DOLLARS OPEN HEART SURGERY THAT

02:34:20.718 --> 02:34:23.654 region:rollup2
WAS IT.

02:34:22.420 --> 02:34:25.123 region:rollup2
TODAY WE HAVE.

02:34:23.654 --> 02:34:26.924 region:rollup2
SOME PATIENTS QUALIFY FOR

02:34:25.123 --> 02:34:27.758 region:rollup2
MILLION BASE OF SURGERY THAT CAN

02:34:26.924 --> 02:34:29.127 region:rollup2
PUT IN A PULMONARY VALVE OR

02:34:27.758 --> 02:34:30.895 region:rollup2
OTHER VALVES.

02:34:29.127 --> 02:34:32.764 region:rollup2
AND THREE ARE GROWING POSSIBLY

02:34:30.895 --> 02:34:34.732 region:rollup2
OUR NECK DEPENDING ON HOW HOW.

02:34:32.764 --> 02:34:36.300 region:rollup2
BIG THE CHILD THIS.

02:34:34.732 --> 02:34:38.603 region:rollup2
WE SAW THIS A MAX WAS TEN HE

02:34:36.300 --> 02:34:39.504 region:rollup2
RECEIVED ABOUT THIS WAY.

02:34:38.603 --> 02:34:40.972 region:rollup2
WHEN THAT MAX WAS SEVENTY HAD

02:34:39.504 --> 02:34:42.773 region:rollup2
OPEN HEART SURGERY IT WAS A SIX

02:34:40.972 --> 02:34:43.674 region:rollup2
MONTH RECOVERY IS VERY PAINFUL

02:34:42.773 --> 02:34:45.443 region:rollup2
AND HE WAS SIDELINED FROM HIS

02:34:43.674 --> 02:34:46.811 region:rollup2
WIFE. WHEN HE WAS TEN HE

02:34:45.443 --> 02:34:48.679 region:rollup2
RECEIVED ONE OF THESE VALVES

02:34:46.811 --> 02:34:50.014 region:rollup2
MEMBER INVASIVE ALSO WE LEFT THE

02:34:48.679 --> 02:34:51.349 region:rollup2
NEXT DAY OF THE TYLENOL AND A

02:34:50.014 --> 02:34:52.984 region:rollup2
BANDAID.

02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:55.620 region:rollup2
SO IT'S IT'S TRANSFORMATIVE WHAT

02:34:52.984 --> 02:34:57.188 region:rollup2
CAN HAPPEN THAT ONLY HAPPENS IF

02:34:55.620 --> 02:34:58.856 region:rollup2
THE HOSPITALS CAN KEEP UP WITH

02:34:57.188 --> 02:34:59.924 region:rollup2
THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO KEEP UP

02:34:58.856 --> 02:35:01.425 region:rollup2
WITH TECHNOLOGY THAT INDUSTRIES

02:34:59.924 --> 02:35:02.226 region:rollup2
PROVIDING.

02:35:01.425 --> 02:35:03.895 region:rollup2
BUT I'LL TELL YOU IS SITTING

THERE WATCHING HIM JUMP UP AND

02:35:03.895 --> 02:35:06.030 region:rollup2
DOWN AND I WAS BEGGING HIM NOT

02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:07.732 region:rollup2

02:35:12.770 --> 02:35:15.239 region:rollup2
THESE.

02:35:13.171 --> 02:35:16.607 region:rollup2
PAST BONDS AND THIS PAST

02:35:15.239 --> 02:35:18.709 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION SIXTY ONE AND THREE

02:35:16.607 --> 02:35:19.577 region:rollup2
THEY HELPED CREATE TODAY WITHOUT

02:35:18.709 --> 02:35:20.478 region:rollup2

MAX.

02:35:23.414 --> 02:35:26.284 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSITION WILL HELP

02:35:24.515 --> 02:35:27.952 region:rollup2
CREATE TOMORROW AND TOMORROW IS

02:35:26.284 --> 02:35:29.387 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT OF THOSE CHILDREN

02:35:27.952 --> 02:35:30.988 region:rollup2
LIKE MAX WHO LIVE WITH LIFELONG

02:35:29.387 --> 02:35:32.490 region:rollup2
DISEASE MAX IS NEVER GOING TO BE

02:35:30.988 --> 02:35:34.125 region:rollup2
CURED. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN NEED A

02:35:32.490 --> 02:35:35.560 region:rollup2
PACEMAKER EVENTUALLY RUN OUT OF

BATTERY JUICE HE'S GONNA BE NO

02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:39.096 region:rollup2
VOWS BECAUSE ARTIFICIAL THOUGH

02:35:36.961 --> 02:35:40.731 region:rollup2
WEAR OUT. AND SO WE ALWAYS HAVE

02:35:39.096 --> 02:35:42.600 region:rollup2
ON OUR MIND WHAT THAT WHAT THE

02:35:40.731 --> 02:35:43.768 region:rollup2
HORIZON IS.

02:35:42.600 --> 02:35:45.636 region:rollup2
I'VE LIVED IN THESE CHILDREN'S

02:35:43.768 --> 02:35:47.171 region:rollup2

AND IN MY OPINION JUST AS A MOM

02:35:50.908 --> 02:35:53.678 region:rollup2
AN OUTSIDE OBSERVER.

02:35:52.510 --> 02:35:55.780 region:rollup2
THERE'S FOUR THINGS THAT MAKE

02:35:53.678 --> 02:35:56.847 region:rollup2
THEM SUCCESSFUL ONE IS THE

02:35:55.780 --> 02:35:58.382 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL'S ATTRACTING THE TOP

02:35:56.847 --> 02:36:00.151 region:rollup2
TALENTS CALIFORNIA AND KEEPING

02:35:58.382 --> 02:36:01.452 region:rollup2
IT IN CALIFORNIA.

02:36:00.151 --> 02:36:02.787 region:rollup2
TWO IS OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES

02:36:01.452 --> 02:36:04.422 region:rollup2
THAT WE SUPPORT WE HAVE AN

02:36:02.787 --> 02:36:05.923 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION TO INSPIRE AND INFORM

02:36:04.422 --> 02:36:07.391 region:rollup2
THEM OF WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:36:05.923 --> 02:36:08.659 region:rollup2
TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL

02:36:07.391 --> 02:36:10.161 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO DON'T

02:36:08.659 --> 02:36:11.829 region:rollup2
THINK THEY'LL EVER NEED IT. NONE

02:36:10.161 --> 02:36:13.598 region:rollup2
OF US EVER THINK WE'LL NEED IT

02:36:11.829 --> 02:36:14.999 region:rollup2
AND SO WE DO.

02:36:13.598 --> 02:36:16.467 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT FAMILIES LIKE MINE

02:36:14.999 --> 02:36:18.035 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

02:36:16.467 --> 02:36:18.936 region:rollup2
NOT JUST CONSUMER HEALTH CARE WE

02:36:18.035 --> 02:36:20.738 region:rollup2

CONTRIBUTE BACK TO IT.

02:36:20.738 --> 02:36:22.807 region:rollup2

THOSE WHO COME BEHIND US.
