GOOD MORNING ONE WELCOME EVERYONE TO THE WEDNESDAY MARKS THE TWENTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MEETING OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE. LIKE TO ASK MA'AM SECRETARY IF YOU COULD PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. HERE. HERE. I NORTH. DALY. YOUR FAILED HERE TROLLING. SHOWING HERE GLORIA GIPSON GLORIA. MOM. WHAT? WE HAVE A QUORUM TO BEGIN AND I KNOW OTHER MEMBERS WILL BE JOINING US SHORTLY. SINCE I WILL BE PRESENTING BOTH OF THE BILL'S TODAY I AM GOING TO TURN THE GAVEL OVER. TO MISTER GLORIA I TRY TO DO YOUR JOB. YOU COULD. OKAY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR. OF WELCOME FORTY AYE PISA. PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB TWENTY ONE C. HE WON. BOTH OF THE BILLS THAT WILL BE CONSIDERING TODAY ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WHICH WE HAVE IN ADDITION. TO HOUSING CRISIS. WE'RE LIVING AT A TIME OPTICALLY THIS PAST YEAR WHEN WE'RE READING ABOUT IN THE NEWSPAPERS TENT ENCAMPMENTS IN EVERY CITY AND. REGION OF OUR STATE. HOMELESSNESS CAUSED BY FIRE AND MUDSLIDES HEPATITIS A AND E. COLI OUTBREAKS. OUR AT THIS TIME CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST HOMELESSNESS RATES IN THE COUNTRY. TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF AMERICA'S HOMELESS ARE IN CALIFORNIA FORTY TWO PERCENT OF AMERICA'S CHRONICALLY HOMELESS ARE IN CALIFORNIA. IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE ALSO SEEN THE HIGHEST INCREASE IN THESE NUMBERS AND BY HIDES FEDERAL. NUMBERS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THEY ESTIMATE THAT WE HAVE NEARLY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMELESS CALIFORNIANS ARE ON OUR STREETS WHICH OF MANY OF US BELIEVE IS LIKELY AN UNDERCOUNT. THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR HOMELESSNESS WE ALSO KNOW THAT HOMELESSNESS LEADS TO ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR GOVERNMENT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. ARE CORRECTION SYSTEM A MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM OR SOCIAL SERVICE SYSTEM. AND I THINK EVERYONE WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT IN ORDER FOR US TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IT TO UNDERSTAND IT WE NEED TO MEASURE AND ANALYZE DATA IF YOU CAN'T MEASURE WHAT'S GOING ON. YOU CAN'T SOLVE IT SO AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY ONE IS A BILL FOCUSED ON HOMELESS DATA COLLECTION. IT WOULD ESTABLISH A STATEWIDE DATABASE TO COMPILE AND CENTRALIZED HOMELESSNESS DATA WE ASK EACH CD TO WORK WITH THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCE COUNCIL TO DO THAT. THIS WOULD BE DATA RECEIVED FROM A VARIETY OF STATE AGENCIES AS WELL AS LOCAL AGENCIES ON WHO IS HOMELESS WHY. WHAT SERVICES ARE WE PROVIDING TO THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS WHAT PROGRAMS ARE WORKING WHAT GAPS AND PROGRAMS WE HAVE? THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HOMELESSNESS AND THE IMPACT ON PUBLIC PROGRAMS. WE ALSO. INCLUDE PROVISIONS TO ADDRESS PRIVACY ISSUES AND I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THERE ARE OTHER STATES IN FRONT OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE ALREADY DOING THIS. MICHIGAN CONNECTICUT OHIO AND NOW NEW YORK IS STARTING TO PROCESSES DATA. OUR THANK OUR SPONSORS HOUSING CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS A CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESS. SOME. HI I AM I AM A VERY WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING. AND. AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY ONE SOULS TO ESSENTIAL PROBLEMS ONE WITHIN THE HOMELESS DATA ITSELF AND ONE ACROSS SYSTEMS. SO. EACH CONTINUE OF CARE HAS ITS OWN DATABASE OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND THOSE DATABASES STONE PARK WHICH OTHERS SO IF SOMEONE IS RECEIVING SERVICES AND HOMELESS WHEN PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AS WE ARE TRANSIENT POPULATION OF SEVEN TH RECEIVE SERVICES IN. MORE THAN ONE COUNTY THE BE PRESENT IN MORE THAN ONE DATABASE. AND THEY'LL BE COUNTED MORE THAN ONCE IF YOU TRY TO COMPILE STATEWIDE NUMBERS. AND ALSO PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ESPECIALLY CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS AS THE ASSEMBLYMANTHIRD ARE LIKELY TO BE RECEIVING CRISIS SERVICES TO YOU GO TO THE ER. THEIR JUSTICE INVOLVED. BUT IF THERE ISN'T A GOOD WAY TO. ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HOMELESSNESS AND THOSE SERVICE SINCE. IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ONE DATABASE THAT TELLS YOU WHO WHO'S EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS HAS ALSO BEEN IN THE ARMY IS ALSO. JUST AS INVOLVED. SO BY BRINGING ALL THIS DATA SETS TOGETHER IT'S POSSIBLE TO CONDUCT THESE LONGITUDINAL STUDIES THAT WOULD TELL YOU. BOTH WHAT SERVICES ARE BEING USED. AND WHAT SERVICES ARE NEEDED. OF THE CURRENT COST OF THE SYSTEM AND TO THE TRUE COST OF DOING NOTHING. RIGHT BECAUSE YOU COULD SEE THE COSTS THAT ARE BEING GENERATED BY PEOPLE NOT GETTING THE HOUSING THAT THEY NEED NOT BEING STABLE HOUSE TO NOT BEING ABLE TO AVOID CRISIS CARE AND TO GET PREVENTIVE SERVICES OR DIVERSION SERVICES FROM. THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND. I I WOULD ALSO JUST SAY ONE MORE THING WHICH IS THAT IN IMPLEMENTING. AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY ONE IT'S GOING TO BE NECESSARY TO BRING AND THE VARIOUS CONTINUANCE OF CARE TOGETHER TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. ABOUT HOW THE DATA WILL BE SHARED AND THAT'S ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY A PLATFORM THAT WOULD CONVERSATION ABOUT A SHARED VISION FOR THE STATE OF HOW WE GET TO A PATH TO AND HOMELESSNESS. SO CONVERSATIONS ABOUT DATA SOUND BORING IN THE ABSTRACT BUT THEY CAN VERY OFTEN ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE STAKEHOLDERS TO REALLY CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THE DATA. BE THE BASIS FOR SHARED. WORK FAR OUT EXCEEDING JUST THE COMPOSITION OF THE DIVISION ITSELF. BIGGEST PERRY I THINK YOU SHOULD A WILL OF GOD IT NOW AS A SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. MEANWHILE MUST COME FORWARD AND. SHARE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS LEGISLATION. GOOD MORNING. TYRONE BUCKLEY HOUSING CALIFORNIA. PLEASED THE CO SPONSORS BILL AND HAPPIEST WHERE THINKING BECAUSE THERE. GOOD MORNING HER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WHERE IN STRONG SUPPORT AND PARTICULARLY. THE NEED FOR DATA I THINK HIS EX STREAMLINED IMPORTANT THESE DAYS AS WERE FACING A NUMBER OF DECISIONS AND PARTICULARLY THAT ARE IMPACTING PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. AS WE START LOOKING TO EXPANDING CONSERVATORSHIP CENTER NIMBY ISSUES THAT. REALLY SEEM TO BE OUT THERE AND I THINK THE MORE INFORMATION THE DAY THAT WE CAN PUT TOGETHER AND USE I THINK WILL BE HELPFUL TO YOU ALL AND I SAW IN LOOKING AT THAT THESE ISSUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. I INITIAL SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. SEE NO ONE RACING UP TO SPEAK ANY ILLNESS OPPOSITION. SEE NINE YOU HAD YOUR OPPORTUNITY ARE IT WILL. TURN TO THE COMMITTEE. ANY QUESTIONS FOR MISTER CHAIR. THE MOTION FOR APPROVAL BY CITY NEVER DALY. SUCH A CHOICE YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS. YEAH I WANNA MAKE A CALM THAT. O. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS CHOOSE I FO DOT TO. SOLVE. TO ISSUES OF HOMELESSNESS. WHICH IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. BUT THOUGHT I'M WONDERING. THIS A CREATION OF OUR NEW DATA WAREHOUSE. WHICH I READ IN THE FISCAL NOTE. EFFECT IS SO UNKNOWN. DO YOU HAVE. ESTIMATED. COSTA HOW MUCH IT'LL COST. BUT I WOULD IMAGINE. IT WOULD BE IS. SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS IF NOT THE IN EVEN TWO DIGITS. TO ME. IT IS A LIE CHO WENT THE DESCENT LACK OF. DATA. I HAS BEEN THE PROBLEM IS SOLVING THIS SO HOMELESSNESS. AND THAT THIS HAS SOUGHT TO ME. DIVERTING THAT. THE MONEY THAT COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO. EVEN HELPING. A FEW MORE. NOT THE US AND IF NOT THE HUNDREDS OF HOMELESS PEOPLE. AND OTHER BUREAUCRACY. TO SPEND. YOU NO CREATING OF ARE NOT DATA WAREHOUSE ARE IS A NOT JUST A FACT OF LIFE. A DATABASE. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A FACILITY WOULD HAVE. PUSHED NOW TO SUPPORT. AND I I THINK I DO SO FISCAL IMPACT AROUND ANALYSIS OF WHETHER THIS IS SO REALLY GREAT THE WAY OUR FOR SPENDING THAT KIND OF THE MONEY. TOSS MY QUESTION. ARE. YOU KNOW EFFORT IS SO NOBLE. BUT IT IS SO. A QUESTIONABLE WHETHER. THE SUB BETTER WAY OF EXPANDING ON WHAT RESOURCES. WHETHER THIS A LACK OF. A DATA. I EVEN CROSSED THE STREET. WE WAY WE WE FISCALLY SEE THE HOMELESS PEOPLE ON THE STREET. BUT THE AVE THERE BECAUSE HAVE WELL. THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE. THAT'S MY QUESTION. AND. IS A QUITE INTERESTING TO READ. DE OPPOSITION OUR ARGUMENT. BUT IDEA. ANALYSIS SO HERE. WHEN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED A. S. B. AT THIRTEEN EIGHTY. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO CREATE THE. COORDINATING COUNCIL THE WHOLENESS OF ADVOCATES HEY IN. HATED IT. AS HIS SOLUTION. TO INDIA. MANAGING THE DIVERSE A PROGRAM SO TO SOFT IS SO ELUSIVE UP PROBLEM. OR THOUGHT HE COUNTS ON. HAS ONLY BEEN NOT IN EFFECT. A SCANT THE FIFTEEN MONTHS. THE SAME ADVOCATES ARE EVER RETURNED. INSISTING THAT. A WHAT THE STATE THE REALLY NEEDS IS SOME MORE DATA. AT THE MINIMUM THE DATABASE. OF CAN BE ESTABLISHED. BUT MR DE REALLY. AND THE. EXECUTIVE ORDER. WORSE THOSE STATE THAT CREATES A THESE A ANOTHER REQUIREMENT. Y. EL. D. PROBLEM GOALS. BESIDES THE. LEGISLATURE ALREADY PASSED SO NO PLACE LIKE HOME IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN CREATING. TWO BILLION DOLLARS. IN NEW FUNDING. FOR CONSTRUCTION OF SUPPORTIVE HOUSING UNITS. OR SO ON NOVEMBER THIS YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BALLOT. VOTERS TO OR CONSIDER APPROVING. AND OTHER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS BOND TO FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT INCLUDE ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS SO FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. WITH THE NEW MONEY. THAT IS SO. LIKELY TO BE GENERATED WHEN THIS PASSES. I THINK JUST SHOULD BE OUT OF THIS MONEY CAN BE. USED LET MR DUTIFULLY BUY THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS RATHER THAN CREATING AND OTHER. OF BUREAUCRATIC. LAW AGENCY OUGHT TO CREATE A SUCH A DATA WAREHOUSE IN THE MANAGE THEM SO ARE ARTICULATE WOULD IT BE BETTER. I USE ALFA SUCH RESOURCES SO. OUT FOR ADMISSION BUREAUCRACY PURPOSES RATHER THAN HELPING TO HOMELESS PEOPLE DIRECTLY THAT'S MY QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR FOR THAT QUESTION AND AS YOU SAID A LOT IN YOUR STATEMENT SO LET ME TRY TO ADDRESS SOME ASPECTS OF IT. YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL OF YOU STATE AT THE OUTSET THIS MAY NOT BE THE BEST USE OF MONEY AND THERE MAY BE OTHERS AND IF YOU HAVE SOLUTIONS AND WHAT YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO DO TO ADDRESS. THE MOST INTENSE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS I THINK MANY OF US HAVE EXPERIENCED I'D BE HAPPY TO TO MEET WITH YOU TO UNDERSTAND YOUR IDEAS. ON THIS IS ONE OF OUR MY IDEAS AND AND AND HOW WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS. I THINK YOU ALSO SAID THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHOSE HOMELESS ON THE STREETS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SOLUTIONS ARE AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE WHAT WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING IS THAT. WE COLLECT THIS DATA SO WE UNDERSTAND WHO'S HOMELESS ON THE STREETS WHY THEY HOMELESS WHAT SERVICES THEY RECEIVE AND WHAT ARE THEY NOT RECEIVING. AND WHAT'S EFFECTIVE AND WHAT'S COST EFFECTIVE BECAUSE WE KNOW. THAT WE ARE SPENDING. I. PROBABLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON HOMELESSNESS IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS BUT WE'RE NOT. BRINGING DOWN THOSE NUMBERS IN FACT THEY CONTINUE TO SKYROCKET AND WE NEED TO BE SMART AND. AND HOW WE DO THAT. NOW WITH REGARDS EXPENDITURE UP WE ARE AT THIS MOMENT ARE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH AGENCIES TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS AND COST EFFECTIVE WAY I DO NOT THINK IT'S GONNA BE IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND I THINK IT'LL BE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THAT BUT I'D SUGGEST. THAT I THINK IT WOULD BE A PENNY WISE POUND FOOLISH DECISION TO NOT SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROBLEM LOOKS LIKE SO FOR EXAMPLE. THERE ARE A LOT OF CITIES THAT HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO BUILD SUPPORT OF HOUSING. EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW THAT IF YOU'RE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS A TYPICAL CITIES AND COUNTIES SPEND ANYWHERE FROM FORTY TO SIXTY TO EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR A CHRONICALLY HOMELESS PERSON WHO IS NOT HOUSED IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING RATHER THAN SAY FIFTEEN OR TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO HOUSE AND HOW DO WE KNOW THIS WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE A COUPLE OF JURISDICTIONS. HAVE HAD THAT DATA. AND IF WE CAN COLLECT THAT DATA STATEWIDE AND REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. WE JUST HEARD FROM OUR WITNESS. THAT THERE ARE LIKELY QUITE A FEW HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS THAT TRAVEL FROM CITY TO CITY OR COUNTY TO COUNTY TO USE REDUNDANT SERVICES. WE KNOW THAT ANECDOTALLY BUT WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH THAT'S COSTING US IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND THE CORRECTION SYSTEM THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM OR OTHERWISE AND SO. PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS. TO INVEST A FEW DOLLARS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS DATA LOOKS LIKE SO WE CAN USE OUR MONEY MORE SMARTLY KNOWS FIRST WHERE THE MONIES COME FROM YES IT'S ABSOLUTE TRUE THAT. WE WILL HOPEFULLY BE INVESTING MORE MONEY IN HOMELESS SERVICES IN THE COMING YEARS AND I WOULD BE FINE IF OF A DECISION WAS MADE TO TO PULL SOME OF THAT MONEY TO TO ACHIEVE THIS BUT. MY BROADER POINT IS. IF WE DON'T HAVE THIS DATA WE WON'T BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY SPEND THOSE MONIES AND SO THAT'S REALLY THE POINT OF THE BILL. AND I THOUGHT THAT WOULD JUST END BY SAYING I KNOW YOU'RE A PHD AND I THINK YOU APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING DATA AND EVIDENCE. BEFORE YOU MOVE FORWARD ON POLICIES AND HYPOTHESES AS TO WHAT TO DO AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS A. THANK YOU RICHARD. MAY I JUST SO YOU KNOW FOLLOW UP ARE AYE AYE AYE AYE NO DATA ARE ARE ARE IMPORTANT UP BUT UP WHAT DOT. BASICALLY. WHEN I HEAR FEWER DAUGHTERS SO. I DON'T THINK THAT'S SO AND IF YOU THE HARRIS ADDED BE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THE AUDITORS. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT THAT MONEY CAN BE USED. ACTUALLY HELPING BECAUSE WE WE PHYSICALLY NORMAL. LIKE. IF YOU APPROACH. THAT IT IS CITY OF A SACRAMENTO. BUTTON THAT WOULD HAVE OUR ESTIMATE NUMBER. AND THOUGH WHERE CONCENTRATED POPULATION ARE AND ACADEMICALLY ANALYZING WHAT COST AT THE HOMELESSNESS AND OF THEM MENTAL STATUS SO WHAT ARE THEY REALLY ACTUALLY HELPING THEM. WE KNOW FISCALLY VIA PAYER HOW WE CAN USE HAVE TO MONEY ACTUALLY STATES HAVE BEEN. THE HOMELESS PEOPLE RATHER THAN THIS UP BUREAUCRATIC. YOU KNOW STUDY RESEARCH ORIENTED THAT DATA HAUSA W. TO REALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM LAST. MAY I. FINISH UP BY MY QUESTION YOU KNOW IF I I'M I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO EVERY WORD YOU SAY IT'S FAIRLY REPETITIVE I THINK YOU'VE MADE YOUR POINT MISTER CHOI YEAH I'M I'M REALLY JUST BEING DISTURBED THOUGH WHEN NOT YEAR TRY TO CUT ME OFF OF WHEN WE. DON'T KNOW WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS MEETING NOW IF WE DON'T HAVE TASK TO ASK QUESTIONS. BUT YOU'RE NOT ASKING QUESTIONS TO. GO AHEAD PLEASE ASK TO ASK YOU A QUESTION IF YOU HAVE ONE SIR. BUT I'VE MADE I THINK WE UNDERSTOOD THE POINT YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT IRAQ CHRISSY IN THE MISUSE OF FUNDS I THINK WE HAVE MADE THE POINT. THANK YOU SIR. THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WISH TO ASK. CHIEF QUESTION. NO I JUST WANT TO COMMENT ON THE POINT WHICH IS A IS DATA WITH THE. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEING SPENT. BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE GOVERNMENT. MONEY THAT'S ALREADY BEING SPENT AS WELL AS MONIES THAT MAY BE SPENT IN THE FUTURE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE GOOD SOLID STATE WIDE DATA. IN MY OWN COUNTY ORANGE COUNTY WITH THIRTY FOUR CITIES IT'S HARD TO GET A STRAIGHT ANSWER FROM ANY PARTICULAR AUTHORITY ABOUT. WHERE THE HOMELESS LIVE HOW MUCH MONEY'S BEEN IS BEING SPENT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM? THE COUNTY. DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE THE ANSWERS AS WE'VE SEEN JUST IN THE LAST FEW DAYS WERE A FEDERAL JUDGE HAD TO INTERVENE. AND MANAGE BASICALLY MANAGE THE COUNTY'S MONEY BECAUSE THE COUNTY. DID NOT KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY IT HAD THEY ALSO CAN'T REALLY CALCULATE HOW MANY HOMELESS. PERSONS THERE ARE SO YOU HAVE A A REAL MISMATCH. IN TERMS OF MANAGING THE SITUATION SO WE MUST HAVE GOOD DATA STATEWIDE AND COUNTY BY COUNTY AND JURISDICTION BY JURISDICTIONS SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY. HELPFUL BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR UP MISSED LOOK THIS MONTH MS LIMON BEFORE WE DO CAN I STAB SHOW A QUORUM FOR CREATES I THINK WE ARE TO ESTABLISH THE COURT YOU ALREADY OKAY I THINK EVERYONE'S HERE NOW. ALRIGHT WE'LL GET ALMOST EVERYONE IS LIMON THANK YOU AND AND. I JUST I I WANTED TO SHARE AND. DAD TO IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY AT DATA'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL TO HELP US UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM BUT ALSO TO HELP US. UNDERSTAND THEAPPROPRIATE SOLUTIONS SO WE DO A HOMELESS COUNT. WITH LOCALS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND IT'S BEEN PARTICULARLY HELPFUL SO I THINK FOR ME MY REASONS FOR SUPPORTING THIS ALSO INCLUDE THAT IT'S NOT JUST UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM IT'S UNDERSTANDING ALSO. THAT INFORMATION THAT'S GOING TO LEAD US TO THE MOST APPROPRIATE AND BEST RESPONSE FOR THIS. I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU IS ADDED DO WE HAVE ANY IDEAS IN TERMS OF I. YOU KNOW WILL THIS BE ALIGNED WITH WHAT I THAT WHAT SOME COUNTIES MAYBE ALREADY DOING IS ALIGNED WITH ANY OTHER ASSOCIATIONS OR IS THIS REALLY AN IDEA TO JUST HAVE A AND IT WILL BE WORKED OUT THROUGH THE PROCESS. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SHARE DATA WITH EACH OTHER BUT IT'S BEEN HARD. AND THIS IS NOT A TRIVIAL TASK AS WE ALL KNOW DATA IS HARD TO COLLECT AND FIGURE OUT A SHARED IN A WAY PARTICULAR THAT PROTECTS PRIVACY. BUT I THINK EVERYONE FROM LOCAL COORDINATING COUNCILS TO COUNTIES TO THE STATE ALL WANT THE STATE AND BE ABLE TO COMPARE NOTES AND AND HOW IT IS THAT WE ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS GRAY AND THEN I THINK IS A TRANSIENT COMMUNITY TO THAT KNOWS THAT. YOU KNOW THIS SOME FOLKS MOVE FROM ONE COUNTY TO ANOTHER THERE'S. REALLY VALUE IN SEEING THIS SO WITH THAT I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADD MOVE THE BILL SINCE WE DO HAVE QUORUM. PLACE THEM ON A MISTER DALY I MOVE THE BILL BUT YOU WOULD HAVE A SECOND IT NEVER GOT SO LITTLE MOTION BY MISTER DALY SECOND BY MS LIMON TUCKED AWAY. I WANT TO THANK YOU OF MISTER CHIEF RING THIS BEFORE WHEN I FIRST READ THE BILL I THOUGHT WOW WE DON'T DO THIS ALREADY. THAT WAS MY RESPONSE WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE DATA WILL BE INCREDIBLY VALUABLE. AND. WHEN YOU LOOK AT NOT JUST HOW CITIES CLICK CLICK DATA BUT HOW COUNTY TO COLLECT DATA. AND THE MOVEMENT ARE JUST WITHIN COUNTIES. CAN BE CAN BE REALLY CHALLENGING TO DO TO TO UNDERSTAND BUT ALSO. THAT KIND OF THE I THINK AS YOU COLLECT THE DATA AS AS IT IS COLLECTED WILL BUILD SEE WHAT OF THE DISPARITIES IN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES VERSUS LARGE URBAN AREAS AND. AND BECAUSE THEY WERE THERE THERE ARE DISTINCTIVELY DIFFERENT CHALLENGES THEIR SO. AND EVERYBODY BELIEVES. IN THEIR OWN CITIES THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS THAT THEY FACE AND IDEAS. A BUT THE SCALE IS OBVIOUSLY VERY DIFFERENT BUT SO I I THINK IT'S A GREAT BONE APPRECIATE RECEIVING A FORD THINK IF. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD A JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR. AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE. MOTIVATION BEHIND THE BILL I HAVE A SIMILAR EFFORT IN SAN DIEGO WHERE ARE WE SHOOTING OF CARE REALLY HAD NOT DONE MUCH ON EACH IN MY S.. AND DOING IT. WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO SOME OF OUTCOMES BASED THING NOW WE CLEARLY HAVE CRISIS DOWN THERE SO. THIS IS NOW WAY PANACEA BUT YOU CAN'T SOLVE A PROBLEM WITHOUT DIDN'T HELP YOU UNDERSTAND SO I I GET THE TEMPLATE. MY EXPERIENCE OF THAT LEAVES ME A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THE BILL NOT THAT I WILL SUPPORT A ONE VERY CLEAR I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THIS. AT THE MENTION OF THE. ABOUT THE PRIVACY ISSUES. YOU KNOW HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO IDENTITY THEFT. THEIR WILLINGNESS TO SHARE INFORMATION IS PRESENTED AND YOU MADE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT PRIVACY I SAW THEM NOTES IN THE REPORT CAN YOU EXPAND UPON THAT HOW CAN WE BE SURE. AT THAT THE DATA FOR THAT HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS THE DATA FOR THEIR HOME FOR THE VIGIL CONTINUED TO CARE FOR WHICH THEY THE CUSTODIANS OF THIS INFORMATION. BUT IT'S PROTECT IT WILL BE BREACHED THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL LIABILITY THAT WE'RE CREATING FOR THEM BY PASSING THIS BILL SO FOR SMALL THAT IS ACTUALLY OUR INTENT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT DATE IS NOT PREACHING WE PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF INDIVIDUALS ARE JUST NOTE IN THE BILL AYE IT SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT THE DATA WAREHOUSE SHALL MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF HIDES. A HMS STANDARDS AND PROTECTING PRIVACY OUGHT TO THAT'S THE STARTING POINT BUT THAT BEING SAID WE ARE IN CONVERSATIONS AS WE SPEAK WITH ADVOCATES. AYE AND DIFFERENT COORDINATING COUNCILS AROUND THE STATE ON WHETHER THERE ARE ADDITIONAL PRIVACY LAYERS THAT WE SHOULD ADD TO WHAT IS THE FEDERAL STANDARD. A PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE ARE FACING IS WE'RE GONNA BE ASKING FOR DATA FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND TYPES OF AGENCIES AND THEY EACH HAVE. PRIVACY STANDARDS. THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO ABIDE BY SO. WE WILL LIKELY BE. LAYERING ON DIFFERENT PRIVACY STANDARDS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THOSE LAWS ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH WHICH I ABSOLUTE SUPPORTED THINK WE NEED. AND YOU GOT THE NEXT CONCERN I HAVE WHICH IS THE THE DIFFERENCE IS THE DATA BETWEEN COUNTIES IMAGINES ONE OF THE VALUES AND. THE KEYS WERE TO THIS MAY BE A LITTLE BIT. ISN'T STANDARDIZING THIS DATA ON BUT I I KNOW WHAT WE WERE COLLECTING PREVIOUS TO FINISHED IF I HADN'T SAN DIEGO WAS PRETTY MINIMAL. ON THE BACK END OF THIS IT'S EXTREMELY DETAILED I'M NOT JUST PUTTING NOT TRUE COST ALL THE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA IS THE INTENT OF THIS BILL THIS WRIST ENTERPRISE INFORMATION OR YOU CAN ACCEPT THE DATE IN WHATEVER FORM IT COMES FROM. TOWN THAT'S ALSO THIS IS PART OF THE CHALLENGE AROUND DATA I THINK PART OF IT IS TO HAVE A STANDARD SET OF DATA THAT WE CAN COMPARE AND COLLECT FROM LOCAL AGENCIES AS WELL AS FROM STATE AGENCIES BUT. DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS ARE COLLECTING DIFFERENT DEPTHS OF INFORMATION SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA DISCOVER OVER TIME WILL START WITH PROBABLY BASIC DATASET AND THEN SEE OVER TIME WHO'S DOING THE BEST JOB OF COLLECTING DATA THAT'S HOPEFUL AND AND PROBABLY ADD TO THE DATABASE. WELL I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I AM I BUT I KNOW THAT YOU'RE INTO IS IS GOOD I TOTALLY TRUST YOU ON THIS ISSUE. SO I HOPE YOU CONTINUE WORK ON THE ISSUE OF PRIVACY I'M ON STANDARDIZATION OF DATA YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES YOU CAN'T REALLY COME TO RELIABLE CAN KEEP CONCLUSIONS. THAT'S AS IT EASIER SAID THAN DONE. IT WAS NOT EASY GETTING ALL THE SAN DIEGO'S ALMOST PROVIDERS TO GET ON THE SAME PAGE FOR. DATA COLLECTION TOOL I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THIS TASK WILL BE STATEWIDE BUT I DO THINK THERE'S EXTREME VALUE IN IT. PREPS THE THE. LAST THING I WOULD MENTION IS AYE. DOCTOR CHOICE MAKING THE POINT ABOUT THE COSTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS AND I ACTUALLY WOULD ALIGN MYSELF MORE CLOSELY WITH HIM. WITH REGARD TO HOW MUCH THIS MAY COST YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT THIS MAY CAUSE I IT SAYS UNKNOWN IS A FISCAL IMPACT IN THE REPORT YOU MENTION THAT YOU SORT OF TRY NATURE ARMS AROUND THAT IS OUR IMPLEMENT EVERY SORT OF BALLPARK. FIGURES THAT YOU'VE SEEN AND ASK BY STAFF OF FOR. WHAT IS LATEST CONVERSATION THAT YOU HAD ON THIS? WHAT WE'RE TALKING EIGHT SEE ABOUT COSTS BUT? FOR HUD PROVIDES UP FRONT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SET UP A. A WAREHOUSE AND THEN WE'LL GO TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE NEXT ALL HAVE TO WORK WITH THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ON THE COST ISSUES OUT OF ANTI HAS ANYTHING DATA. I'M SORRY I DID ASK A FEW EXPERTS FOR ESTIMATES AND THEIR ESTIMATES WERE I AM. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO COMMIT TO ANYTHING BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY VARIABLES WITH THEIR ESTIMATES WERE ON THE SINGLE THE ONLY SINGLE DIGIT MILLIONS NOT IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS. WELL GOING BACK TO THE POINT THAT HE MADE EARLIER A YOU KNOW I WILL CALL ELISE FOR SAN DIEGO IT DID IT WAS A SIMILAR SIZED FIGURE FROM ONE COUNTY AND SO I AM CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT. WILL ULTIMATELY BE STATEWIDE. I DON'T NEXT I DON'T THINK THAT'S A REASON NOT TO DO IT BECAUSE WE ARE AT SUCH CHOICE POINT THAT'S BEEN BILLIONS ON THIS MATTER. ON MY HOPE FOR THESE KINDS OF EFFORTS IS THAT YOU CAN REDUCE DUPLICATION I'M OF SERVICES PROVIDED. THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY START MEASURING OUTCOMES OF THESE PROGRAMS IN ALL PROGRAMS ARE MIDDLE LIKE ARE AND IT'S NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE GREAT OUTCOMES THAT THIS DATA COULD HELP US TO FIGURE OUT WHO THE GOOD ACTORS ARE. AND STEER MORE THESE LIMITED FUNDS TOWARDS THEM AND DE FUND THOSE WHO DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT OUTCOMES ARE NOT ALIGNED THEIR PROGRAMMES AT THE POWERS THE STATE. I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE WHERE THE. DELIVERABLE FROM THIS I WOULD NO I THINK WHAT STAFFERS WERE GETTING TOO I THINK THIS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN MAKE AN INVESTMENT IN THESE KINDS OF EFFORTS I HOPE THAT WE WOULD. AYE MY CONCERN IS TO MAKE SURE THESE COSTS ARE NOT BORN ON BY THE VIGIL CONTINUES OF CARE. AND NONE OF THEM ARE PRETTY GOOD WELL FUNDED I SPENT A LOT OF TIME FUND RAISING FOR OUR LOCAL EFFORTS AND ANY EFFORT THAT WOULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL BURDENS BOTH COST IN TERMS OF THAT THE. I TEAR WHAT NOT WE DON'T STAFF TIME WOULD BE OF SOMEWHAT CONCERNED I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU SAN DIEGO CA BARRETT I COULD IMAGINE A SMALL COUNTY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO SO. IF WE CAN KEEP AN EYE ON THAT GOING FORWARD OFFICE WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS BUT HE'S NOT INSIGNIFICANT THINGS. BUT NOTHING WORTH DOING APPARATUS RIGHT SO. I DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR FOR. BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT DOUBLES ALWAYS IN THE DETAILS BUT THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS VERY IMPORTANT SIDE OF WASN'T LOOKING FOR TO SUPPORTING THIS BILL THIS MORNING. OUR INITIAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE. SEEN AND WE HAD A MOTION BY MISTER DALY WAS STRUCK BY MS LIMON COULD I JUST MAKE A CAR THAT'S RIGHT I FINAL COMMENTS NO IS SO APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION AND IN ONE THING I'LL NOTICE I LOOK AT. EACH OF YOU AND THE DISTRICTS YOU REPRESENT. THE CHAIR REPRESENTS THE DISTRICT WHERE WE SAW HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK WE HAVE TWO MEMBERS FROM ORANGE COUNTY WHERE WE HAVE SEEN TENT ENCAMPMENTS ALONG THE SANTA ANA RIVER. WE HAVE TO REPRESENTATIVES FROM SANTA BARBARA AS WELL AS FROM. OUR OUR OUR NORTHERN COUNTIES WHICH HAVE SEEN UP FIRES AND MUD SLIDES THAT HAVE CREATED THOUSANDS OF NEW HOMELESS RESIDENTS. THIS IS A CRISIS WE ALL HAVE TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND AND AND LET ME ALSO SAY. WE DON'T HAVETHE DATA THAT I BELIEVE IS A STATE WE SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR ON HOMELESSNESS I'LL JUST SAY FOR SAN FRANCISCO. THE LATEST COUNT WE SPEND CLOSE TO FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR MY CITY OF EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND. AND SO IF YOU EXTRAPOLATE. IT'S LIKELY WE'RE SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR AND OUR HOPE IS THAT IF ASSUMING THE SYSTEM COSTS A FEW MILLION A SMALL FRACTION OF THAT. THE THE GOAL OF THIS IS TO SAVE MONEY IN THE LONG RUN AND TO BE MORE EFFICIENT AND HOW WE TARGET OUR DOLLARS. ARE IN THE LESSON YOU'LL SEE IS IF THERE ARE OTHER IDEAS AND I WOULD SAY THE SPECIFICALLY TO OUR OUR OUR COLLEAGUE FROM IRVINE IF THERE OTHER IDEAS THAT YOU HAVE AND HOW TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS I AM VERY OPEN. UP WITH A CRISIS WE'VE GOT ACT NOW AND I THINK IT HAS TO START WITH UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE PROBLEM IS SO WITH THAT. APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION AND RESPECT WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. IT IS VERY ASSERTIVE PLEASE FOLLOW. THE MOTION TO PASSING pAPPROPRIATIONS STEINORTH. DAILY. DALY AYE CHOI NO SHOWING NO GLORIA AYE GLORIA AYE WE MONTH. LIMON I WOULD. PUT AYE CHIU AYE CHIU AYE. THAT. IT'S FIVE TO. TWO ZERO. PHIL IF I WANT TO. FIVE ONE FIVE FIVE ONE AM SO YEAH YES FIVE ONE. A THAT THAT MOTION PASSES I. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TAKE UP YOUR NEXT BOOK SURE LIKE TO ASK MISTER BAILEY IF YOU LIKE TO JOIN ME SO MANY WOULD MAKE PROCEED MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU AGAIN FOR CONSIDERING. A SECOND BILL TODAY ON THE TOPIC OF HOW WE DRESS OR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS I DON'T WANT TO BE REPETITIVE OF WHAT I MENTIONED FOR. ABOUT GENERAL THOUGHTS ON OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS BUT EVERYTHING WERE SEEN IN EVERY DISTRICT IN THE STATE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THE HIGHEST NUMBERS HIGHS PERCENTAGE OF HOMELESSNESS. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF CRISIS AND WE NEED TO DO MORE. THIS IS A BILL. TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WHICH IS HOUSING THAT IS PAIRED WHICH SOCIAL SERVICES THAT ARE TARGETED AND ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE IN THEIR HOUSING. PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING HAS BEEN A PROVEN METHOD OF REDUCING HOMELESSNESS AND I WOULD SAY OUR IT ALSO HAS PROVEN TO BE A VERY COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF REDUCING. ARE THE COSTS WHEN SOMEONE IS NOT HOUSED YEAH THEY'RE TYPICALLY INCURRING COSTS WHEN IT COMES TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM THE CORRECTION SYSTEM AND OTHERS. WE HAVE HEARD FROM ORGANIZATIONS AND DEVELOPERS AROUND STATE THE BUILDING PERMIT SUPPORT OF HOUSING. OFTEN TAKES MANY YEARS BECAUSE OF THE LOCAL APPROVAL PROCESS AND THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO STREAMLINE THE APPROVAL. OF ONE HUNDRED PERCENT AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT INCLUDE A MINIMUM PERCENTAGE OF SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SPECIFICALLY EITHER INCLUDE THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE PROJECT THAT IS SUPPORTIVE WORE A FIFTEEN UNIT MINIMUM. SERVICES WOULD NEED TO BE PROVIDED ON SITE. OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WOULD BE ABLE TO APPLY OBJECTIVE AND QUANTIFIABLE DESIGN STANDARDS AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW SUPPORTIVE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TREATED LIKE RESIDENTIAL HOUSING. INTENT FOR LAWS REALLY TO NOT CREATE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO SUPPORT OF HOUSING TO TREAT THIS KIND OF HOUSING LIKE ANY OTHER RENTAL HOUSING. THIS BILL WOULD BUILD ON. THAT PREMISE AND HOPEFULLY PREVENT DEVELOPMENTS FROM BEING STALLED AS RESULT OF LOCAL OPPOSITION. I'M REALLY PLEASED TO BE JOINED BY. BY MY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COLLEAGUE MISTER DAILY AND I WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO HIM. THANK YOU MISTER CHIU. AS THE BILL READS HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA HAS REACHED A CRISIS STAGE. AND IN MY OPINION SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WHICH THIS BILL ADDRESSES IS ONE OF THE BETTER SOLUTIONS TO THE CHALLENGE. IN ORANGE COUNTY THE DEBATE OVER HOW AND WHERE TO HOUSE THE HOMELESS IS NOW BEING MANAGED BY THE FEDERAL COURTS. BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH SHELTER BEDS AND ALTERNATIVES. AND NOT ENOUGH COMMUNITIES. HAVE STEPPED UP TO ALLOW. PROJECTS LIKE THIS. RESEARCHERS AT UC IRVINE IN ORANGE COUNTY FOUND THAT THE COST OF SERVICES FOR THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS DECLINED STEEPLY WHEN THEY ARE PLACED IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING. JUST THREE MONTHS AGO A PROJECT CALLED THE ORCHARD OPENED IN MY DISTRICT IN THE CITY OF SANTA ANA. THIS IS THE LARGEST PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROJECT TO DATE IN THE CITY OF SANTA ANA. THE DEVELOPER HAS CONVERTED AN OLD MOTEL INTO A SEVENTY TWO UNIT COMMUNITY DEDICATED TO HOUSING CHRONICALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. THIS PROJECT BRINGS TOGETHER SEVERAL ENTITIES INCLUDING THE CITY OF SANTA ANA WHICH IF OF A PROVIDING RENTAL ASSISTANCE. AND MERCY HOUSE A NONPROFIT WHICH IS PROVIDING SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR THE NEW RESIDENTS AND THAT'S THE KEY IT'S FAR MORE THAN A SHELTER IT'S A. SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. SERVICES ARE FINE TUNED FOR THE POPULATION TO BE SERVED. AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT A PROJECT LIKE THAT WILL GET HOMELESS OFF THE STREETS THERE'S JUST NO QUESTION. THAT. THIS IS PART OF THE SOLUTION. THE AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY TWO WILL HELP PROMOTE THE CONSTRUCTION OF MORE PROBLEM SOLVING PROJECTS LIKE THIS ONE. IN AREAS WHERE CITIES ALREADY PLANNED FOR AND ALLOW MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPMENT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE PROJECTS LIKE THIS. MISTER CHU AN IRA ARE FOCUSED ON. CAN BE. DEVELOPED IN AREAS WHERE THE. EXISTING ZONING ALLOWS IT AND WHAT THE CITY IS SUPPORTIVE FOR THE CITY OR COUNTY IS SUPPORTIVE. SHORTENING THE PLANNING IN APPROVAL TIMELINE WILL ALSO REDUCE THE COST OF BUILDING. WHICH WE HOPE WILL INCENTIVIZE OTHERS TO CONSTRUCT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN OTHER CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE VOTE AND I WANNA THANK MISTER CHIU FOR HIS SO. VERY VERY FINE WORK ON THIS SUBJECT. THIS TIME I LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES I WANT TO THANK BOTH CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING AS WELL AS HOUSING CALIFORNIA FOR BEER SPONSORS OF THE BILL. AND TURN IT OVER TO YOU. GOOD MORNING SHARON REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU SAID WITH OVER FORTY TWO PERCENT OF THE NATION'S CHRONIC HOMELESS POPULATION CALIFORNIA HAS INVESTED OR HAS A PAST FUNDING. FOR SOME CRITICAL PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. INCLUDING NO PLACE LIKE HOME AND HOUSING FOR HEALTHY CALIORNIA. IN FACT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS THE ONLY EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTION FOR THIS POPULATION. AND IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN THAT SOLVED LONG TERM HOMELESSNESS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF DATA DEMONSTRATES THAT SUPPORT OF HOUSING NOT ONLY STABILIZES PEOPLE IN HOUSING BUT AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED DECREASE ALLOWS THE TENANTS TO DECREASE THEIR. HEALTH CARE CHILD WELFARE. AND CORRECTIONS COSTS. IT ALSO HAS THE BENEFIT OF IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR THE TENANTS. DATA ALSO SHOW THAT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IMPROVES PROPERTY VALUES AND DECREASES BLIGHT AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH IT'S BELT. YES SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS VERY DIFFICULT TO BUILD IT REQUIRES AN AVERAGE OF THIRTEEN SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR THE CAPITAL OPERATING AND SERVICES COSTS. TO BE COMPETITIVE FOR THIS FUNDING SUPPORT OF HOUSING MUST BE GREENER. IT MUST BE MORE SECURE. IT MUST OFFER MORE INTENSIVE SERVICES AND IT MUST SERVE THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. THEN. THAN MARKET RATE HOUSING. DESPITE GOING THROUGH ALL OF THESE HURDLES TO GET SUPPORT OF HOUSING PROJECTS FUNDED. DEVELOPERS HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME BUILDING SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BECAUSE OF CITING. SIMPLY BECAUSE OF AN MD ISM. AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY TWO WOULD ALLOW SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROVIDERS. TO RECIEVE BY RIGHT APPROVAL FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING PROJECTS AS LEARNED LIST LONG A CERTAIN OBJECTIVE STANDARDS ARE MET. IT ENSURES DEVELOPMENTS MAY BE BUILT MORE QUICKLY MEETING A GOAL EXPRESSED BY MULTIPLE LEGISLATORS TO GET OUR MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS HOUSE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WELL WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT. SENATE BILL THIRTY FIVE WILL ALLOW MANY OF THESE PROJECTS TO MOVE FORWARD. AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY TWO WOULD FURTHER EXPEDITE THE REVIEW PROCESS. IT WOULD ALSO PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND COMMUNITIES EXCLUDED FROM S. B. THIRTY FIVE. AND THEY WILL APPLY TO FARM MORE PROJECTS THAN HER FAR MORE SITES THAN S. B. THIRTY FIVE WELL. AND ADDRESSING ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS TO CREATING SUPPORTIVE HOUSING CITING. AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY TO TAKES A CRITICAL STEP FORWARD IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AND WE REALLY WANT TO THINK. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAIRMAN THE CO AUTHORS OF THIS BILL AND. ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS THROUGH THIS BILL. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS TYRONE BUCKLEY ON BEHALF OF HOUSING CALIFORNIA I'M I WOULD CONCUR WITH. MUCH OF WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID. ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL. THE ONE THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT. IN THE IN TAKING A HOUSING CRISIS SERIOUSLY LEGISLATURE HAS APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFIED THAT NAME BE ISM IS PLAYING. A LARGE ROLE IN THE CREATION OF OUR HOUSING CRISIS AND WE'VE SEEN THE LEGISLATURE. PUSH FOR PROPOSALS SEEKING TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM AND APPLY STREAMLINING. OFTEN TO MARKET RATE HOUSING. AND SO THE VALUE OF THIS BILL IS THAT IT REALLY PUSHES. THAT. PROPOSAL AND THAT STRATEGY TO SOME THE MOST DIFFICULT HOUSING TO CITE AND COMMUNITIES. SO WITH THAT I'M WERE VERY. PLEASE STAND UP THINK FOR THE AUTHOR AUTHORS HAVE BROUGHT THIS FORWARD AND. ARE. HONOR TO SPONSOR IN SPORTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE TO A PUBLIC COMMENT OR ASK FOR SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND AN ORGANIZATION ON THE RECORD. BRIAN AUGUST ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT. I KNOW LAWLER WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. HER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL YET BUT WE RECOGNIZE THE DIRE NEED TO GET MORE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING UNITS BUILT AND THAT'S WHY WE REQUESTED. A THREE HUNDRED MILLION FROM THIS YEAR'S BUDGET SURPLUS TO FRONT LOAD THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM AND GET THAT PROGRAM STARTED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. SO I THINK IN RELATION TO THAT I THINK WERE ALSO WILLING TO HAVE THE DIFFICULT CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO ON THE LAND YOU SIDE TO FACILITATE THE FASTER DEVELOPMENT OF THESE UNITS. AND WE WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE CONSULTANT AND TO CONTINUE TO REFINE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. BUT I THINK THE BIG REMAINING THINGS FOR US ARE GONNA BE CLARIFYING THE INTENT WITH REGARD TO THE ZONING STANDARDS THAT WOULD APPLY TO THESE PROJECTS. I'M DISCUSSING WHETHER THERE NEEDS TO BE ANY SORT OF FILTER ABOUT THE SITES WHERE WOULD APPLY. AND THEN MAKING SURE SOME OF THE TECHNICAL THINGS SUCH AS THE TIME LIMITS AND THE PARKING STANDARDS MAKE SENSE FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT CONTEXTS WHERE THEY CAN APPLY BUT. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING THAT CONVERSATION AND HOPE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN SUPPORT THE BILL. YOU SIR. ODDS THAT'S WHAT THOUGH THOSE ARE THE SUPPORTERS WHO IS A SPEAKERS OPPOSITION THIS MORNING. CNN WILL RETURN UP HERE TO THE DYESS AND GO TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMITMENT COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS DR WHAT. WELL THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FOR BOTH OF YOU APPRECIATE THIS. I THINK YOU'VE HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD EARLIER MISTER CHIU WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT. SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND HOUSING AND HOW THAT IMPACTS HEALTHCARE WE ALL THAT WE KNOW ALL TOO WELL FROM OUR HEARINGS RECENTLY THAT. WE AND IN THE UNITED STATES ONLY SPEND ABOUT FIFTY FIVE CENTS ON THE DOLLAR FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE SPEND ON HEALTHCARE FOR FOR HOW FOR SOCIAL SERVICES. WHERE IS OTHER COUNTRIES THAT HAVE MUCH BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES A SPEND TWICE THAT WERE ACTUALLY FOUR TIMES AT ALMOST TWO DOLLARS FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE SPEND ON HEALTHCARE SO? SO THE MORE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES MORE HOUSING WE HAVE I THINK CAN REALLY HELP. THE POPULATION THAT NEEDS IT THE MOST AND ALSO HAVE A POSITIVE PACKED OUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. BUT TREASURE FROM HANS QUESTIONS. YES I DO IDEA AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE. ASSEMBLY CHOOSE HAVE FOR THE ADDRESS OF THIS OMINOUS. MISSY ISSUE. I WONDER WHAT THE. ONCE THE WATER LE. YEAH TAKE MY A. SUCH GESTION TO AMANDA IN. TO SAVE DATA. TO ALLOW. ALL THE HOUSING PROJECTS AND NOT JUST A. OUR OF WHAT MORE FOR HOMELESS. NO PEOPLE BECAUSE SESSION ON. YEAH THIS IS SO PROBABLY INTENDED TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESSING TIME WISE AND ALSO AGREED TO STOP COST OF THE BUILDING. AND THE GOVERNMENT. APPROVAL PROCESS SO IT'S OUT FOR IT TAKES JUST A LITTLE TOO LONG AND COSTLY AND THAT THAT DRIVES UP BUT THE HOUSING COSTA. SO ARE NOT YOU WORKING PEOPLE I THINK ARE I'M WAR INTERESTED AND PREVENTING. TO BEGIN WITH THE HOMELESSNESS. DE AND ALL IT IT PASS HOLDER RANGE UP WHAT TOPICS WE CAN TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW. IT ARE DEVELOPING IN A BUSINESSES AND UP IN A JOB SET TO BEGIN WITH THE. END OF IT. NO. NO WAIT WE CAN CALL BACK OF WHERE THE. PROBLEM BEGINS SEPT ARTE. HOUSING COSTS A HIGH HOUSING COSTS THAT IS SO. ON ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE TYPICALLY TALK ABOUT. BUT THE RATHER THAN. HELPING. AFFORDABLE HOMES FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE. WHAT ABOUT THE? ALLOWING ALL ALL THE. DEVELOPERS SO. A TO BENEFIT US SO THAT THE WORKING FAMILY THE. MEET PRICE TO. A MARKET PRICED. HOME CELL WOULD BENEFIT THE SAME WAY BYPASSING THE SIKH Y. WERE REQUIREMENTS AND THE LOCAL ZONING BECAUSE IT THIS IS BASICALLY WE TRY TO BYPASS THOUGH SO. WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO THAT. SO I THINK THAT YOU AND I BOTH SHARE AND I THINK ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WE SURE THE GOAL OF WANTING TO. MOVED FOR HOUSING CREATION MORE QUICKLY LAST YEAR YOU MAY REMEMBER WE HAD A VERY ROBUST DEBATE ON WHAT YOU JUST MENTIONED THIS VERY SPECIFIC IDEA. OF HOW WE STREAMLINED. HOUSING CREATION AT ALL LEVELS OF THE HOUSING MARKET A SB THIRTY FIVE WAS HOTLY DEBATED AND I CAME THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE AND PARTS OF S. B. THIRTY FIVE WHICH STREAMLINED. MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENT. AND DEVELOPMENT AT ALL LEVELS OF AFFORDABILITY I HAD A BILL I THINK YOU SUPPORTED IT AB SEVENTY THREE WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH INCENTIVES FOR THE STREAMLINING OF PROJECTS AGAIN AT ALL LEVELS. OF AFFORDABILITY SO WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION THIS PARTICULAR BILL THOUGH HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON PERMITS PORT OF HOUSING BECAUSE THERE HAD BEEN. MIGHT MANY MORE PARTICULAR REASONS WHY THESE SORTS PROJECTS ARE ARE BEING BLOCKED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE WANNA MAKE SURE THEY'RE TREATED LIKE OTHERS AND. THINK THE LAST THING I WILL SAY IS. A YOU'D REFERENCE EARLIER THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DOLLARS THAT WE SPENT BEING SPENT. WELL AND WISELY AND WE'VE MADE A LOT OF INVESTMENTS AND HAS A STATE TO PROVIDE THEM TO ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER. PERMANENT SOURCE. DEVELOPERS AND YET THEY HAVE TO SPEND YEARS DEALING WITH THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS. AND THE POINT OF THIS BILL IS TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS FOR FOR FOR THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING. DEVELOPERS SO THAT RATHER THAN THE MONEY GOING INTO THE PROCESS THAT ACTUALLY GOES INTO. TO TO PUTTING A ROOF OVER SOMEONE'S HEAD SO. THE DISCUSSION THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED I THINK HOUSE WE WE'VE HAD IN THIS COMMITTEE THIS PAST YEAR I THINK IT'S AN ONGOING CONVERSATION I'M HAPPYTO. ENGAGE IT. OUT WITH OTHER BILLS BUT THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THE THAT THE PLIGHT IT THAT IS FACING THOSE THAT ARE TRYING TO BUILD MORE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. YEAH I KNOW YOU ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS OUT THERE RIGHT NOW WILL NOT SHOW UP PEOPLE AND TIMES MAKE THE HOMES UP TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOMES FOR THEM BUT I'M TRYING TO. IN A SOFT THE BASIC PROBLEM HERE TO BEGIN WITH THE WE CAN ROLL WITH THE HOUSING COSTS HOW MUCH IT IMPACT. BUT THEY SHOULD HELP US HOA RATHER THAN IN A YOU KNOW PROVIDING. WE HAVE NOT A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM SET TO BEGIN WITH YOU CAN PREVENT UP A KNOWING. NOW CAN WE HOPE OR THAT THE GOVERNMENT THE REGULATIONS THAT. BEGIN WITH AN APPROVAL PROCESS THAT THAT'S WHAT I'M INTERESTED. UNDERSTOOD. BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA. BUT MET AGAIN AT IT LAST YEAR WE SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME ON THAT VERY QUESTION AND I THINK WE WERE ABLE TO GET. SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT BILLS THROUGH THAT ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED AS WE SPEAK THAT TO YOUR POINT WOULD STREAMLINE. THE CREATION OF HOUSING AT ALL LEVELS OF AFFORDABILITY INCLUDING HERE POINT MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENT SO I I THINK IT'S A IT'S A WORTHY CONVERSATION. THAT WE HAVE HAD AND WILL SEE THE IMPACT OF THOSE BILLS THIS BILL THOUGH WAS ONE THAT WE DIDN'T DO LAST YEAR TO REALLY DRESS IN THE SITUATIONS THAT FACE. THE COMMUNITIES THAT THAT NEED PERMITS APARTMENT MAYBE YOU CAN CLARIFY ONE QUESTION I HAVE HERE IS SAYS SO REQUIRES A CITIES AND. COUNTIES. TO APPROVE. IT IN THE BEGINNING A CO OR THE. LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR RULER SORT THE. BY PASSED BECAUSE IT REQUIRES A CITIES. COUNTY SO TO APPROVE. NOTE THE STATUS DE LA ALLOW. IN A CITIES AND. TONY SO LOCAL ZONING REQUIREMENTS. HOPE WHICH ONE WOULD PROCEED NO MISTER CHU AND I ARE BOTH THE. FORMER LOCAL OFFICIALS HE IN SAN FRANCISCO. ME IN ANAHEIM. AND. YOU KNOW THERE'S GENERAL PLANS THAT CITIES MUST. ABIDE BY THEIR LOCAL ZONING. REQUIREMENTS AND. THIS BILL SIMPLY. GIVES THE CITY ADDITIONAL TOOLS TO PROCESS PROJECTS WHICH COMPLY WITH LOCAL ZONING SO THAT'S VERY KEY. THERE'S NO STATE. OVERRIDE HERE. IN TERMS OF ZONING. SO IF THE ZONING FITS THEN THE PROJECT. IS CONSIDERED WORTHY. SO I'LL HOW. HOW WERE YOU THAT IN EVERY CITIES DIFFERENT ARENA CITY OF A CITY LIKE? Y. DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE YEAH I CAN'T IMAGINE THE A FRANKLY APPROACH OF THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS PROBABLY. A WOULD BE UNLIKELY IN THE CITY LIKE IRVINE WHERE EVERY SQUARE INCH HAS BEEN MASTER PLANNED AND ZONED. AND. AND THEIR. IS BASICALLY. NO. ONE MAJOR A DEVELOPER IN TOWN. WELL I THINK THIS BILL FITS OLDER COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE ARE OLD SAY ROADSIDE MOTELS. FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY YEARS OLD AND. AND THE IN SOME CASES THOSE ARE. ARE NOW A HOUSING FOR TRANSIENTS OR OR. MAYBE A PROBLEMATIC PROJECTS IN THE CITY WOULD LIKE TO SEE A SOMETHING TOM. THAT FITS AT TIMES A LITTLE BIT BETTER. AND SO IF IT'S ZONED FOR RESIDENTIAL. THEN A PROJECT LIKE THIS. WELL QUALIFIED. BUT THE CITY STILL HAS TO BE SUPPORTIVE I THINK THAT. THE MAIN. ANSWER HERE SIR IS THAT. I'M A CITY HAS TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH PROJECTS LIKE THIS. I I HOPE SO BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. IN MY DISTRICT BUT THEY CLEARLY IN THE CITY OF. IRVINE SO CONTROVERSY AS A GOING ON. ABOUT ONE HUNDRED ACRE SAVA TONY LAND. WHETHER THAT'S A SEPTIC TO US CITIES. ZONING REGULATIONS. AND THE KALLONI ACTS ARE LIKE A IS NOT SO. BEFORE. THE SUPERVISORS US SUGGESTION TO PETER DOT POWER SEEING FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE. A COUPLE DAYS AGO UP PRIOR TO THAT THE EVEN A VERY HIGH DENSITY OF COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT. AND THE COUNTY WANTED TO. COME UP GOAL WITH THAT THE HOWEVER NASSAU FASTEST CITY. REQUIRED. THAT RIFLE THROUGH ZONING PROCESS AND UP PROCESS AND THE NORTH THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND WHAT THE CITY WILL HAVE PLENTY OF CONTROL A WITH ITS. ZONING POWERS. I'M A LITTLE WHEN SHE IS PASS IS TAUGHT THIS WHERE AGAIN. ARE AT THAT ADDITIONAL IN NOT MUCH. WELL WHAT WHAT W. WE HAVE A WHOLE KIND OF WHAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES OR HALF OF THE OPEN CHORE ON THEIR OWN FATE DEL ON THE US TUNING REGULATIONS OF PASSED MY WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. YEAH I IN MY OPINION THEY'RE SUFFICIENT PROTECTIONS FOR CITIES IN THIS BILL. IF I COULD JUST AS PART OF A CONVERSATION JUST POINT OUT YOU U. S. SORT OF TWO THINGS ON THE ONE HAND YOU WANT STREAMLINED HOUSING AND ON THE OTHER HAND YOU'RE SAYING LOCAL. GOVERNMENTS OUGHT TO HAVE CONTROL OVER WHAT THAT HOUSING HAS I WOULD SUBMIT I THINK WE WOULD PROBABLY AGREE. THAT OFTENTIMES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE ADDING ALL SORTS OF OWNERS CONDITIONS ONTO THESE PROJECTS OF THAT THEY DON'T GET BILLED SO. I THINK THE GOAL IS TO BUILD MORE HOUSING ARE WHAT WE'RE SAYING HERE IS THAT THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT IF THEY MEET THE ZONING ARE IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS THEY SHOULD BE ENCUMBERED WITH ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS THAT WOULD SLOW IT DOWN. OR OTHERWISE ADD YEARS FOR THESE PROJECTS TO GET BUILT SO UP SO TO. MY COLLEAGUE. MIGHT MY JOINT AUTHOR ON THIS. THE IDEA IS. LOCALS WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO DICTATE WHAT THEIR ZONING RULES ARE. BUT WE'RE ALSO SAYING TO A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING DEVELOPER IS IF YOU MEET THOSE CONDITIONS YOU SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO TOUCH YOUR PROJECT MOVE FOR WITHOUT BEING AND. ENCUMBER FOR MANY YEARS. YOU SEE THAT BOUNCE. SO. MISTER CHAIR YES. BUT CHOI THANK YOU. I WILL MAKE A MOTION TO ADVANCE A. THIS IT'S LEGISLATION I'M I'M I JUST QUICK QUESTIONS FOR OF FOR THE AUTHOR. IN THE STATE IS WHAT. I'M OFF FOR THIS IN I THINK THAT WHAT YOU'RE GETTING TO IS THE IDEA THAT CONCEPTUALLY AND I ALSO SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IT'S ONE THING TO PASS A GENERAL PLANS WHEN THEY TO PASS A COMMUNITY PLAN IT'S ON A VERY HIGH LEVEL BE SINGS A FINE WHEN SOMEONE SHOWS UP WITH THAT DEVELOPMENT PERMIT AND SAYS THAT APARTMENT MULTI FAMILY. COMPLEX YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT IS GONNA BE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AS WE HAVE SEEN IN MANY CASES THE PROJECTS TO SLOW DOWN. AND THERE'S A MILLION ONE REASONS TO SLOW WALK OR TO TRY AND A A NOT ADVANCE THESE PROJECTS THAT AS YOU KNOW IS HAPPY IN A CONTEXT OF EXTREME. HOMELESSNESS THAT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT SO THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS I THINK ON A SALEABLE. THE ONE THING I WILL SAY IS I'M ALWAYS CONSERVATIVE AS WE TRY PUSHY NBA AGENDA APPEAL TO THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT WE ADDRESS. HOUSING CRISIS IS THAT WE DON'T DO ANYTHING UNDERMINES THE PUBLIC'S BELIEF IN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. AND SO IN THIS REGARD I HAVE PERSONALLY SEEN THAT CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS CAN BE HELPFUL IN IN CAPTURING SCOTT PUBLIC SUPPORT. FOR PROJECTS THAT HAVE ONSITE SERVICES. MY READING OF THE OF THE. DOCUMENTS PROVIDED FOR THIS COMMITTEE HEARING IS THAT THIS IS FOR A PURPOSE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WITH THE SERVICES ARE LIMITED TO THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE COMPLEX. IS THAT CORRECT MISTER CHAIR. THAT IS. THAT IS MY IN TENSE NAM IS THERE. GIVE ANYTHING LIKE TO ELABORATE ON THAT IT ACTUALLY DOES IT. SERVICES HAVE TO BE PROVIDED TO THE TENANTS IN THE PROJECT IT DOES NOT LIMIT THE SERVICES TO. PEOPLE LIVING THERE SO FOR EXAMPLE SOME SUPPORTIVE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS BUILD OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINICS ON THE FIRST FLOOR. THOSE WOULD NOT BE LIMITED TO JUST THE RESIDENTS UNDER THIS BILL I THINK MOST OF THE TIME SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS JUST PROVIDING SERVICES TO THE RESIDENTS. BUT THERE ARE SOME OCCASIONS WERE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS PROVIDING AS I MENTIONED CLINICAL CARE TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AS WELL. AND SO THAT'S THE RIGHT NOW IN GUY LIKE ME AND YOUNG OR MY PETS BUT IT ON THE STAFF. I'M ALL IN FAVOR RIGHT BUT I DO KNOW THAT WHEN YOU START INVITING FOLKS MY OUTSIDE OF THE COMPLEX THE RESIDENTS OF THAT COMMUNITY THE NEIGHBORS. THEN THINGS GET A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT RIGHT IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ANY SORT OF ONSITE FEEDING PROGRAMS BUT I AM NOT HEALTH CLINIC RIGHT IT'S WHEN THEY DIVIDE SERVICES FOR THE FOLKS ARE THERE. IN USE NOTHING MISTER DALY MISTER CHOOSE POINT IF YOU'RE TELLING AS A MARKET RATE FOR THE HOUSE OF MARKET RATE HOUSING PROJECT THE ONSITE SERVICES ARE THE GEM OF FOR THE RESIDENTS OR THE FIRE PIT FOR THE RESIDENTS OR WHATEVER. NO CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS OR. RIGHT BUT WHEN YOU START PROVIDE SERVICES WHICH IS THE SAME THING I HAVE TO BE DONE POPULATIONS OF THE SERVICE IS DIFFERENT BUT ALSO WE START BUTTON. RULES IN AGAINST SLOWING DOWN THE PROCESS THE PROJECT BECOMES AN UNTENABLE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO TO SOLVE. I THINK WHAT HAPPENS AND WHERE WE START TO LOSE PUBLIC SUPPORT IS IF THESE PROJECTS ARE BUILT IN THERE'S QUEUING OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING RIGHT FOLKS LINED UP FOR LUNCH OR FOR DINNER. IF YOU SEEN YOU KNOW. AFFAIR NOT HEAVY TRAFFIC THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT TEND TO I THINK ABOUT THE PUBLIC SUPPORT AND TRUST THE I GET A SENSE OF PEOPLE MORE OPEN TO THIS COULD SEE HOW BAD THE CONDITIONS ARE. AND SOMEONE UNDERMINE THAT AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO USE THAT WHEN I WAS A C. COUNCIL MEMBER TO GET I THINK WERE THE CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS THAT REALLY LIMIT THAT AND PROVIDES A LEVEL OF CERTAINTY. I THINK THE THREE EXAMPLES IN MY TIME IN THE CITY COUNCIL AYE WE STAB US AS A PART OF MITCHELL USE PERMIT PROCESS AYE NEIGHBORHOOD. OUT COMMITTEE I DID THAT MONTH OF MONTHLY TO TALK ABOUT THE PROJECT RIGHT. IN EACH OF THOSE INSTANCES THOSE COMMITTEES DISBANDED AFTER A SHORT AMOUNT TIME BECAUSE THE CONCERNS OF THEY HAD IN DEMAND IN THE CP. I WERE NOT THOSE THOSE CONCERNS NEVER CAME TO FRUITION. POINT IS THEY GOT I GOT TO THE POINT FOR THE APPROVAL NOW THE BILL IS KIND OF INTO THE DISTORTION GO AROUND THAT AND NOT HAVE THAT BUT. I QUESTION WHETHER NOT THE WISDOM THERE'S WISDOM BEHIND DOING THAT AND IN AND TAKING AWAY. SOME OF THE SAFETIES. MECHANISMS THAT ARE THERE. FOR OFF SITE SERVICES AGAIN I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS LIKE FOR LIKE MULTI FAMILY MULTI FAMILY THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING OF ECONOMIC WRONG OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SERVING THEIR. THEN THAT'S PROBABLY FIND WHAT HELP PLAN THE PROJECTS. AND PERHAPS LIMIT SOME FEATURES IF IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE OF THE CITY'S FINANCIAL INVOLVEMENT THERE MAY BE OTHER PROJECTS. IN OTHER PARTS OF CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE WON'T WHERE THE CITY WON'T BE A FINANCIAL PARTNER. BUT THE PROJECTS I'M FAMILIAR WITH. THERE IS THAT LEVEL OF CITY INVOLVEMENT. AND SO. I THINK THERE'S APPROPRIATE. MY VIEW THEIR APPROPRIATE CONTROLS YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN. BUT I THINK IT'S A PROJECT BY PROJECT. THE DECISION. THERE WILL BE SMALLER PROJECTS THERE WILL BE LARGER PROJECTS IT DEPENDS ON THE ACREAGE. AND I THINK YOU KNOW OLDER COMMUNITIES HAVE DIFFERENT LAND USE HISTORIES. AND. AND SO IT'S WITH THIS REALLY NOT A COOKIE CUTTER OF. SITUATION. SO WERE I THINK ALSO I THINK BECAUSE THE CRISIS WERE IN WE HAVE TO TRY. VARIOUS TOOLS. AND MECHANISMS AND WE CAN ALWAYS REVISIT THOSE. I'VE HAD SOME PUSH BACK IN MY DISTRICT OVER THE CONCEPT OF GRANNY UNITS. BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY. ON PERMITTED GRAINY UNITS GOING BACK SEVENTY FIVE YEARS. WELL THE REALITY IS THERE ARE HAVEN'T BEEN VERY MANY APPLICATIONS TO BUILD THOSE NEW PERMITS. AND THE CITIES DO HAVE THE EVEN THOUGH WE'VE. ENABLED IN CONCEPT MORE BRANDY UNITS A CITY STILL HAVE QUITE A BIT OF OF CONTROL. AND SO THE REALITIES SOMETIMES THE FEARS DON'T MATCH THE REALITY SO AND THOSE SO THAT'S MY HOPE WITH THIS BILL. AND THAT WHILE YOU WERE ASKING THE QUESTION I JUST SKIMMED THE THE LEGISLATION TO TO LOOK AT THE SUPPORTIVE SERVICE PROVISIONS AND. I ALWAYS SAY IN THIS BILL IS THAT THERE SHALL BE A MINIMUM. EITHER NUMBER SQUARE FEET OF NINETY SQUARE FEET FOR A DEVELOPMENTS OF TWENTY OR FEWER UNITS FOR ON SITE SUPPORTIVE OR FOR DEVELOPMENTS WITH MORE THAN TWENTY UNITS AT LEAST THREE PERCENT OF THE. A NON RESIDENT FLOOR AREA TO BE PRESENTED TO THAT ARE SO THAT THIS IS THE FIRST CONVERSATION HAVING WITH A COLLEAGUE ABOUT THIS TOPIC I'M HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH YOU ON THIS. AND. AND HAPPY TO ALSO GET SPONSORS AS WE DO WE THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE JUST RAISED YEAH WELL AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND THEN AGAIN I'M ON BILL I MAKE THE MOTION I'M I THINK IT DOES SOLVE A A REAL PROBLEM THAT WE SEE. ACROSS STATE. BUT IN THAT THROUGH IN THE PASSAGE I THINK YOUR FRIEND TO ON PAGE TWO OF THE STAFF REPORT. AYE THE MENTION OF COMMUNITY KITCHENS I MEAN E. ESTABLISHING A SUPPORT HOUSING COMPLEX DEEP IN A RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY WITH A COMMUNITY KITCHEN THAT CONSERVE THE RESIDENTS I GOT IT. SERVING A BROADER SET OF A COMMUNITY THAT BECOMES A DIFFERENT THING AND I'M THAT'S TYPICALLY WHEN A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT IS APPROPRIATE I'M AYE BECAUSE THIS LEGISLATION STRIPS THAT OUT. AND WE SHOULD HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT AGAIN AYE AYE TILT MORE TOWARDS MORE HOUSING WHAT'S PERMISSIBLE OF HOUSING GET MORE PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS ASAP. BUT THERE'S PROBABLY. SOME SOME THOUGHT THAT WE SHOULD GIVE TO HOW WE DO THIS TO MAKE SURE I'M THAT WERE NOT. THEY WERE DANCING THE PRODUCTION AND NOT THE OPPOSITION FROM THE. CEMEX. I SEE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTION MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO SPEAK ON THIS MATTER. WE HAVE A MOTION BY MYSELF IT WAS SECONDED BY DOCTOR WOULD. MISTER CHIU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AYE I JUST APPRECIATE THE THE COMMITTEES CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF US ALSO WANT TO THANK ALL OF MY JOINTS AUTHOR ON THIS. OBVIOUSLY WE ALL HAVE THE SAME GOAL OF OF TRYING TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS A CALIFORNIANS AND I THINK THIS IS A PART PART OF THAT SO RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. YES. AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK OF MY COLLEAGUE. MISTER CHU AND YOUR POINT IS VERY WELL TAKEN MISTER GLORIA AND I THINK WE'LL. AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS A. THE TO ASSURE OF THE CITY'S THAT THEY'LL HAVE SUFFICIENT. NO POWERS. TO IT'S JIM IS VERY THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUICKLY KALRA. MOTION TO PASSING REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT. STEINORTH. SHOWING NO SHOWING NO GLORIA I'VE GLORIA AYE LAMONT. WOULD. WOULD I. DALY AYE DALY AYE. CHIU AYE CHOO AYE. THAT PASSES FOR ONE. THANK YOU. WE DON'T THINK YOU.
