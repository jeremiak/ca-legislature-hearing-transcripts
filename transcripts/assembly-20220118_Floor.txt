I THAT SAID THAT YOU AND YOUR TEAM DO ON BEHALF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS SOMETIMES WE START TALKING ABOUT OVERSIGHT. ACCOUNTABILITY PEOPLE'S EYES GLAZE OVER RIGHT MAYBE IT'S NOT THE MOST SEXY TOPIC. NOT ALWAYS THE THING THAT GETS YOU THE MOST YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT LIKES ON TWITTER. BUT I THINK ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT IS MORE IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW THAN. EVER I FEEL LIKE AT WE'RE LIVING IN A MOMENT WHERE PEOPLE'S TRUST IN OUR INSTITUTIONS. PEOPLE'S FAITH IN OUR GOVERNMENT I WILL TRUST IN OUR LEADERS IS AT SOMETHING OF AN ALL TIME LOW. AND THE REALITY IS EVERY TIME EVERY TIME THERE'S A CASE OF WASTE FRAUD OR ABUSE ERODES PEOPLE'S TRUST STILL FURTHER. AND THE ONLY WAY THE ONLY WAY THAT WE AS LEADERS CAN REBUILD THAT TRUST. REBUILD THAT FAITH IS TO ENSURE THE I THINK USE THAT WORD THE PHRASE THE PERSISTENT OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE DELIVERING FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT SO. THANK YOU AND AT NEW THAT WE WILL WILL TAKE YOUR WORK. AS AN INSPIRATION AS WE MOVE FOR. MISTER JONES SAWYER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER- AS YOU KNOW I CAME FROM THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES I PROBABLY BEEN AUDITED FIVE TIMES WHEN I WAS WITH THE CITY ABOUT LA.

A LOT OF TIMES THOSE AUDITS WERE ABOUT POLITICS. OR ABOUT HURTING PEOPLE AND IT WAS NEVER ABOUT COMING TO A SOLUTION. AND SO WHEN I GOT HERE. AND I FINALLY MET YOU. YOU WERE ABLE TO CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT AUDITORS. YOU'RE ABLE TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND NOT ONLY WHAT YOU DO. BUT TO RESPECT TO HAVE FULL RESPECT FOR WHAT IN ORDER TO DOES IN FACT. THERE BEEN TIMES WHERE I WANT TO GET INFORMATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OR THEY WOULD JUST BE STUBBORN THEY WOULDN'T GIVE IT TO ME. AND I WOULD SAY. I'M GONNA RIGHT NOT A- I'M A HEAVY LANE HOW ARE THAT YOU AND I GET THAT INFORMATION LIKE. THAT THAT'S HOW MUCH POWER YOU HAD. BUT MOST IMPORTANT THAT'S HOW MUCH RESPECT THE PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING HAD FOR YOU THAT NOT ONLY WOULD YOU DO A THOROUGH AUDIT. BUT IT WOULD BE INTEGRITY LEVEL WOULD BE SO HIGH HEAD KNEW THAT WHATEVER YOU CAME UP WITH THEY WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THE CHANGES THAT ARE NECESSARY AND IT WOULD HAVE TO PROVE TO THE PUBLIC. AND TO THIS BODY. THAT WHAT THEY WERE DOING. WAS THE RIGHT THING OR THAT THEY NEEDED TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES. ARE NOT MAKE THOSE CHANGES AND SO. THAT GIVES YOU HAVE WE'RE GOING TO REALLY REALLY MISS. BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY- I WOULD I WOULD. CHALLENGE ANYONE THAT SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT I'VE MADE SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE IN TWENTY TWELVE. HAVE BEEN BECAUSE OF THE AUDITS YOU PERFORM. THAT PROVE THAT CHANGES NEED TO BE DONE. IN A DRAMATIC WAY. AND A LOT OF THE POLICIES THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW A BASED ON WHAT YOU DID IN YOUR WORK AND SO I COMMEND YOU. FOR DOING THAT I THINK THE PEOPLE. OF CALIFORNIA WHO REALLY DON'T SEE YOU BECAUSE YOU BEHIND THE SCENES. I DON'T THINK THEY REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH.

IT'S ALSO GOING BACK TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS WHETHER IT'S A FEE THAT AND A PARK FUND THAT WHEN WE'RE ADDING FEES WHETHER IT'S THE LOTTERY WHETHER IT'S SURPLUS LAND WHICH IS NOT IT IT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW THAT I ASKED FOR- SO MANY AUDITS THAT I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE PARKING FOR THE CELTS DATE OF THE UC SYSTEM THAT I'VE HAD FIRST HAND NOT ONLY- INVOLVEMENT WITH BY YOU WORKING ON THIS AND COMING TO US AFTER YOU PERFORM.

AND TEACHES SKILLS NEEDED TO HAVE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS AT HOME SCHOOL AND AT WORK WHEN CHILDREN GROW UP AND A POSITIVE LOVING AND SAFE ENVIRONMENT WITH CLEAR AND CONSISTET BOUNDARIES THE BRAINS ARE PRIMED TO LEARN THEY GET ALONG BETTER WITH OTHERS AND SUCCEED AS ADULTS. POSITIVE PARENTING PROGRAMS ARE EVIDENCE BASED AND HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE LIFELINES FOR FAMILIES IN MY OWN DISTRICT HOPE FAMILY SUPPORT AND FIRST FIVE HAVE BEEN LEADERS IN PROVIDING A WIDE ARRAY OF POSITIVE PARENTING CURRICULUMS FOR FAMILIES THROUGHOUT CONTRA COSTA COUNTY HOWEVER THESE PROGRAMS REMAIN UNDERSTAFFED AND UNDERFUNDED PARTICULARLY IN THE WAKE OF COVERT NINETEEN. THE PANDEMIC HAS UNIQUELY CHALLENGED CHILDREN AND FAMILIES BY DISRUPTING ROUTINES CHANGING RELATIONSHIPS AND ROLES AND ALTERING CHILD CARE AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES POSITIVE PARENTING CAN PREVENT OR MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF TRAUMA AND ADVERSITY THAT MANY FAMILIES AND CALIFORNIA ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING. ALTHOUGH PARENTING IS A NONSTOP JOB THAT DESERVES RECOGNITION EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR ACR ONE TWELVE SEEKS TO BRING AWARENESS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTING AND CARE GIVERS TO THE TO DEVELOP WARM NURTURING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND TEENS AND BECOME MORE CONFIDENT AS PARENTS FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES.

BUT ARGUABLY ONE OF THE TOUGHEST JOBS. NO MATTER WHAT YOUR CHILD OR CHILDREN'S AGE ARE YOUR WORK IS NEVER DONE. BUT PARENTING IN THE TIME OF COVERT NINETEEN HAS BROUGHT NEW CHALLENGES WITH SCHOOL CLOSURES WORKING REMOTE PHYSICAL DISTANCE THING IT'S A LOT TO NAVIGATE FOR ANYONE BUT ESPECIALLY FOR PARENTS. THE QUALITY OF PARENTING OR CAREGIVING STARTING PRENATALLY IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL PREDICTORS OF CHILDREN'S FUTURE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. POSITIVE PARENTING AWARENESS MONTH IS A TIME TO RECOGNIZE THE VITAL ROLE THAT PARENTS INCLUDING BIRTH FOSTER AND ADOPTIVE PARENTS GRANDPARENTS AND OTHER RELATIVES OR FAMILY FRIENDS PLAY AND RAISING HAPPY HEALTHY AND THRIVING CHILDREN. IS A CHANCE TO ENCOURAGE ALL TYPES OF FAMILIES TO SEEK AND ACCEPT SUPPORT FROM FRIENDS FAMILY MEMBERS NEIGHBORS AND LOCAL RESOURCES BECAUSE IT TRULY TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD.
