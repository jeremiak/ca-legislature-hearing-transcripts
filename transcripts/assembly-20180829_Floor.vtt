03:57:14.353 --> 03:57:15.955 region:rollup2

DIRECTOR.

03:57:15.955 --> 03:57:18.391 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW THE DEPARTMENT HAD

03:57:17.290 --> 03:57:20.159 region:rollup2
SPENT THE SEVENTY MILLION

03:57:18.391 --> 03:57:21.694 region:rollup2
DOLLARS WE APPROPRIATED LAST

03:57:20.159 --> 03:57:23.396 region:rollup2
YEAR FOR THE PURPOSES OF

03:57:21.694 --> 03:57:25.131 region:rollup2
ALLEVIATING WAIT TIMES SHE WAS

03:57:23.396 --> 03:57:26.432 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY UNABLE TO ARTICULATE

03:57:25.131 --> 03:57:28.000 region:rollup2

03:57:28.000 --> 03:57:31.604 region:rollup2
NOT OPEN THE FIELD OFFICES ON

03:57:30.303 --> 03:57:33.506 region:rollup2

03:57:37.677 --> 03:57:41.180 region:rollup2

THEY WERE FORCED TO VOTE.

04:02:25.998 --> 04:02:28.868 region:rollup2
I HEARD FROM MANY COLLEAGUES

04:02:27.099 --> 04:02:29.835 region:rollup2
THAT CLEARLY DIDN'T WANT TO VOTE

04:02:28.868 --> 04:02:31.470 region:rollup2

04:03:06.272 --> 04:03:09.842 region:rollup2
REVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

MOTOR VEHICLES TO FIX THE

04:03:09.842 --> 04:03:11.977 region:rollup2
PROBLEM EVERY ONE OF OUR

04:03:10.876 --> 04:03:14.046 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS HAS BEEN SCREENING

04:03:11.977 --> 04:03:15.481 region:rollup2
TO US ABOUT.

04:03:14.046 --> 04:03:17.116 region:rollup2
I GOT LETTERS ON MY DESK HERE

04:03:15.481 --> 04:03:19.452 region:rollup2
FROM ELDERLY CONSTITUENTS OF

04:03:17.116 --> 04:03:21.454 region:rollup2
MINE WHO WAITED IN LINE FOR

04:03:19.452 --> 04:03:23.255 region:rollup2
EIGHT HOURS AND PASSED OUT.

04:03:21.454 --> 04:03:25.257 region:rollup2
INJURED THEMSELVES AND WHEN THE

04:03:23.255 --> 04:03:26.692 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY FOLKS CAME THE DMV

04:03:25.257 --> 04:03:27.927 region:rollup2
STAFF SAID TO THEM --

04:03:26.692 --> 04:03:29.328 region:rollup2
IF YOU GET OUT OF LINE YOU'RE

04:03:27.927 --> 04:03:30.796 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAVE TO START ALL OVER

04:03:29.328 --> 04:03:32.198 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

04:03:30.796 --> 04:03:34.934 region:rollup2
SO SHE WAS TREATED FOR HER

04:03:32.198 --> 04:03:36.235 region:rollup2
WOUNDS BY THE EMT IN LINE WITH

04:03:34.934 --> 04:03:37.403 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY WATCHING.

04:03:36.235 --> 04:03:39.071 region:rollup2
THIS WAS DISCUSSED IN THE

04:03:37.403 --> 04:03:39.672 region:rollup2
HEARINGS THAT CAME FORWARD

04:03:39.071 --> 04:03:41.907 region:rollup2
EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT THAT WE

04:03:39.672 --> 04:03:43.375 region:rollup2
HAD.

04:03:41.907 --> 04:03:44.743 region:rollup2
WE ALSO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF

04:03:43.375 --> 04:03:46.078 region:rollup2
MOTOR VEHICLES DIRECTOR SAY

04:03:44.743 --> 04:03:47.379 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR GIVING US EXTRA

04:03:46.078 --> 04:03:48.581 region:rollup2
MONEY.

04:03:47.379 --> 04:03:50.416 region:rollup2
WE SPENT ON SOMETHING OTHER THEN

04:03:48.581 --> 04:03:51.584 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ASK FOR AND OTHER THAN

04:03:50.416 --> 04:03:54.487 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU TOLD US TO DO.

04:03:51.584 --> 04:03:56.288 region:rollup2
WE SPECIFICALLY TOLD THEM. TO

04:03:54.487 --> 04:03:57.957 region:rollup2
SPEND IT ON ADDITIONAL HOURS TO

04:03:56.288 --> 04:03:59.892 region:rollup2
GET AHEAD OF THIS PROBLEM AND

04:03:57.957 --> 04:04:01.760 region:rollup2
SERVE OUR CONSTITUENTS WELL.

04:03:59.892 --> 04:04:02.795 region:rollup2
AND INSTEAD THEY OPEN UP

04:04:01.760 --> 04:04:03.596 region:rollup2
SATURDAY HOURS JUST A LITTLE BIT

04:04:02.795 --> 04:04:04.930 region:rollup2
THEY'RE LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT I

04:04:03.596 --> 04:04:06.298 region:rollup2
THINK WE HAVE A BETTER USE FOR

04:04:04.930 --> 04:04:07.700 region:rollup2
THIS BECAUSE WE KNOW BEST OF THE

04:04:06.298 --> 04:04:09.668 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES.

04:04:07.700 --> 04:04:11.003 region:rollup2
AND SO THEY COMPLETELY CLOSE THE

04:04:09.668 --> 04:04:13.639 region:rollup2
EXTRA HOURS AND SPEND IT ON

04:04:11.003 --> 04:04:15.207 region:rollup2
OVERTIME.

04:04:13.639 --> 04:04:15.975 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS THE SAME YEAR IN

04:04:15.207 --> 04:04:18.244 region:rollup2
WHICH THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR

04:04:15.975 --> 04:04:19.678 region:rollup2
VEHICLES HAD SUCH CRUMMY SERVICE

04:04:18.244 --> 04:04:21.347 region:rollup2
FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS BUT THEY

04:04:19.678 --> 04:04:23.482 region:rollup2
DID PROTECT THE EMPLOYEE WHO

04:04:21.347 --> 04:04:25.017 region:rollup2
SLEPT FOR FOUR YEARS ON THE JOB.

04:04:23.482 --> 04:04:26.185 region:rollup2
AND THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY COME

04:04:25.017 --> 04:04:28.220 region:rollup2
UP WITH A WAY TO FIX THAT

04:04:26.185 --> 04:04:30.256 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

04:04:28.220 --> 04:04:31.690 region:rollup2
SO THE SOLUTION WE HAVE IS NOT

04:04:30.256 --> 04:04:32.725 region:rollup2
TO WORK TOGETHER.

04:04:31.690 --> 04:04:34.260 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT TO HAVE THE AUDIT COME

04:04:32.725 --> 04:04:35.828 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

04:04:34.260 --> 04:04:37.363 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT TO GET RID OF THAT OPS

04:04:35.828 --> 04:04:38.998 region:rollup2
WITH ITS NOT TO FIX THIS PROBLEM

04:04:37.363 --> 04:04:40.399 region:rollup2
AT THE DMV IT'S THIS IT'S TO

04:04:38.998 --> 04:04:42.268 region:rollup2
THROW MONEY AT IT.

04:04:40.399 --> 04:04:45.504 region:rollup2
UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY LET'S

JUST THROW MONEY AT IT.

04:04:45.504 --> 04:04:46.739 region:rollup2
LET'S NOT EVEN TRY TO FIX IT.

04:04:46.105 --> 04:04:48.174 region:rollup2
THERE'S ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

04:04:46.739 --> 04:04:49.842 region:rollup2
THIS MONEY THEY DON'T HAVE TO

04:04:48.174 --> 04:04:50.776 region:rollup2
COME BACK TO US TO KEEP SPENDING

04:04:49.842 --> 04:04:53.646 region:rollup2
THE MONEY THEY HAVE TO GO TO THE

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

04:04:53.646 --> 04:04:55.881 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAVE NO STRINGS

04:04:54.146 --> 04:04:57.716 region:rollup2
ATTACHED.

04:04:55.881 --> 04:04:59.785 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO WORSE WAY TO DEAL

04:04:57.716 --> 04:05:01.587 region:rollup2
WITH THE DMV THAN TO DO THIS SO

ALLOCATIONS WERE DISPLAYED IN

04:21:30.508 --> 04:21:33.778 region:rollup2

FACTOR SAYING THAT WE WERE AWARE

04:21:45.823 --> 04:21:48.159 region:rollup2
OF THAT AND I DON'T SEE HOW

ANYONE COULD SAY THAT THEY ARE

04:21:48.159 --> 04:21:50.428 region:rollup2

THAT.

05:17:49.951 --> 05:17:54.022 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW A COMPANY TO

THAT PAYS FOR INSURANCE THAT

05:17:57.458 --> 05:18:00.662 region:rollup2
FALL SHORT OF WHAT THE PATIENT

THAT THEY WOULD GET AFTER THE

05:18:14.309 --> 05:18:18.212 region:rollup2

TRANSPLANT AGAIN THIS BILL

05:18:28.089 --> 05:18:32.193 region:rollup2

COMPANY TO GAME THE SYSTEM TO

05:18:32.193 --> 05:18:36.264 region:rollup2
MAKE BIG PROFITS OFF OF PATIENTS

05:18:34.395 --> 05:18:37.665 region:rollup2
INTO LEAF PATIENTS IN THE LURCH

05:18:36.264 --> 05:18:39.434 region:rollup2

ASSEMBLYMEMBER VOEPEL.

05:18:50.678 --> 05:18:53.748 region:rollup2
THIS BILL SIMPLY DOES NOT ADD UP

05:18:52.480 --> 05:18:58.753 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE [inaudible]

05:18:53.748 --> 05:19:02.123 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN WHY. 20% OF THE DIALYSIS

05:18:58.753 --> 05:19:03.825 region:rollup2
PATIENTS HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE.

05:19:02.123 --> 05:19:05.059 region:rollup2
OR THEY CAN GET IT SOMEHOW

05:19:03.825 --> 05:19:07.462 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE

05:19:05.059 --> 05:19:09.397 region:rollup2
SAYING HERE.

05:19:07.462 --> 05:19:11.766 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.

05:19:09.397 --> 05:19:14.469 region:rollup2
IF THEY DO NOT HAVE INSURANCE

05:19:11.766 --> 05:19:15.536 region:rollup2
THEN THEY HAVE A FEW CHOICES

05:19:14.469 --> 05:19:17.372 region:rollup2
THEY CAN GO AND GET IN

05:19:15.536 --> 05:19:18.706 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL POLICY IN WHICH CASE

05:19:17.372 --> 05:19:20.708 region:rollup2
THEY'LL BE UNDERWRITTEN.

05:19:18.706 --> 05:19:22.977 region:rollup2
AND REFUSE COVERAGE.

05:19:20.708 --> 05:19:25.380 region:rollup2
THEY CAN ALSO GO WITH OBAMACARE

05:19:22.977 --> 05:19:27.181 region:rollup2
A CA WHICH IS RAPIDLY

05:19:25.380 --> 05:19:29.617 region:rollup2
DETERIORATING.

05:19:27.181 --> 05:19:31.653 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALSO PROBLEMATIC.

05:19:29.617 --> 05:19:33.421 region:rollup2
MOST OF THE PEOPLE.

05:19:31.653 --> 05:19:35.423 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE HAVE

05:19:33.421 --> 05:19:36.658 region:rollup2
GROUP INSURANCE.

05:19:35.423 --> 05:19:39.093 region:rollup2
OR RETIREMENT PLANS THROUGH

05:19:36.658 --> 05:19:39.661 region:rollup2
GROUPS.

05:19:39.093 --> 05:19:41.729 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO SAID ON THE FLOOR

05:19:39.661 --> 05:19:42.930 region:rollup2
HERE.

05:19:41.729 --> 05:19:45.233 region:rollup2
THAT THESE COMPANIES ARE PAYING

05:19:42.930 --> 05:19:47.435 region:rollup2
THE PREMIUMS.

05:19:45.233 --> 05:19:49.237 region:rollup2
THAT'S ILLEGAL YOU CAN'T DO IT.

05:19:47.435 --> 05:19:50.171 region:rollup2
IT'S CALLED REBATE.

05:19:49.237 --> 05:19:51.639 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALSO COVERED IN THE

05:19:50.171 --> 05:19:53.841 region:rollup2
INSURANCE CODE.

05:19:51.639 --> 05:19:56.244 region:rollup2
SO I'M LOOKING AT MANY THINGS

05:19:53.841 --> 05:19:59.514 region:rollup2
HERE THAT DO NOT ADD UP.

PERSON WHO SITS ON THIS FLOOR

05:46:33.172 --> 05:46:37.977 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW DOES NOT CARE ABOUT

05:46:35.808 --> 05:46:40.179 region:rollup2
VICTIMS OF CRIME.

05:46:37.977 --> 05:46:42.682 region:rollup2
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS

05:46:40.179 --> 05:46:45.018 region:rollup2
IT'S A CANARD AND IT HAS NO

05:46:42.682 --> 05:46:46.953 region:rollup2
APPLICABILITY HERE.

05:46:45.018 --> 05:46:48.821 region:rollup2
I'D ASK YOU INSTEAD TO THINK

05:46:46.953 --> 05:46:50.089 region:rollup2
ABOUT CHILDREN.

05:46:48.821 --> 05:46:54.027 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE IN FRONT OF THEM TO DO

05:46:50.089 --> 05:46:54.327 region:rollup2
WORSE [inaudible] ONE DOOR

05:46:54.027 --> 05:46:59.198 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

05:46:54.327 --> 05:47:00.066 region:rollup2
LEADS FROM A CHILDREN'S WORLD.

05:46:59.198 --> 05:47:02.702 region:rollup2
TO ADULT.

05:47:00.066 --> 05:47:04.637 region:rollup2
PRISON WORLD.

05:47:02.702 --> 05:47:07.540 region:rollup2
A COMPLETELY FOREIGN WORLD FOR

05:47:04.637 --> 05:47:09.108 region:rollup2
ANY OF THESE CHILDREN.

05:47:07.540 --> 05:47:11.077 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW WHAT LIES DOWN THAT

05:47:09.108 --> 05:47:13.046 region:rollup2
PATH.

05:47:11.077 --> 05:47:16.749 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MIXING CHILDREN IN THAT

05:47:13.046 --> 05:47:18.384 region:rollup2
WORLD LEADS THEM. TO A LIFE IN

05:47:16.749 --> 05:47:19.852 region:rollup2
PRISON THAT WILL HAVE NO AND IN

05:47:18.384 --> 05:47:21.621 region:rollup2
THAT LEADS TO NO GOOD.

05:47:19.852 --> 05:47:22.955 region:rollup2
EVEN IF THEY GET OUT OF PRISON

05:47:21.621 --> 05:47:25.925 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WILL AFFECT THEM.

05:47:22.955 --> 05:47:29.095 region:rollup2
SO SO DEEP IN THEIR SOULS THE

05:47:25.925 --> 05:47:31.497 region:rollup2
OTHER DOOR LEADS TO A WORLD OF

05:47:29.095 --> 05:47:33.299 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITIES AND NOT EVERYBODY

05:47:31.497 --> 05:47:35.468 region:rollup2

THAT.

05:48:37.163 --> 05:48:40.366 region:rollup2
MUCH OF THE MESSAGE WAS CLEAR.

05:48:38.898 --> 05:48:42.535 region:rollup2
UP WITH REGARDS TO IT BUT I JUST

05:48:40.366 --> 05:48:42.835 region:rollup2

05:48:42.535 --> 05:48:44.570 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

05:48:42.835 --> 05:48:46.572 region:rollup2
THAT.

05:48:44.570 --> 05:48:47.740 region:rollup2
WE CAN NOT CONTINUE DOWN THE

05:48:46.572 --> 05:48:49.675 region:rollup2
SAME PATH THAT WE'VE GONE FOR

05:48:47.740 --> 05:48:50.877 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF YEARS.

05:48:49.675 --> 05:48:52.278 region:rollup2
I MEAN WE KNOW THAT IF WE

05:48:50.877 --> 05:48:53.212 region:rollup2

05:48:52.278 --> 05:48:54.914 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALWAYS DONE WILL GET THE

05:48:53.212 --> 05:48:56.783 region:rollup2
SAME RESULTS.

05:48:54.914 --> 05:48:57.383 region:rollup2
NONE OF US CAN PROBABLY STANDING

05:48:56.783 --> 05:48:59.118 region:rollup2
SAY THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

05:48:57.383 --> 05:48:59.952 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN

05:48:59.118 --> 05:49:01.287 region:rollup2
FAIR.

05:48:59.952 --> 05:49:03.456 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN JUSTIN HAS BEEN

05:49:01.287 --> 05:49:04.724 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE IN KEEPING US SAFE.

05:49:03.456 --> 05:49:06.192 region:rollup2
WE FEEL NO SAFER BY

05:49:04.724 --> 05:49:08.027 region:rollup2
INCARCERATING YOUNG PEOPLE AT

05:49:06.192 --> 05:49:10.663 region:rollup2
THE AGE OF FOURTEEN TO FIFTEEN

05:49:08.027 --> 05:49:11.297 region:rollup2
OR NOT INCARCERATING HIM.

05:49:10.663 --> 05:49:12.298 region:rollup2
EIGHT FOURTEEN FIFTEEN WE CAN'T

05:49:11.297 --> 05:49:13.599 region:rollup2
SAY THAT WE FEEL COMFORTABLE IN

05:49:12.298 --> 05:49:15.201 region:rollup2
OUR HOMES THAT WE'VE DONE THE

05:49:13.599 --> 05:49:16.702 region:rollup2
RIGHT THING IN THIS SENSE.

05:49:15.201 --> 05:49:18.404 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE NOTHING BUT BUILT AT

05:49:16.702 --> 05:49:20.139 region:rollup2
A PRISON SYSTEM INDUSTRIAL

05:49:18.404 --> 05:49:21.574 region:rollup2
COMPLEX IN TERMS OF OUR CRIMINAL

05:49:20.139 --> 05:49:23.643 region:rollup2
JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT MOST OF US

05:49:21.574 --> 05:49:25.244 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF BUT WE HAVE

05:49:23.643 --> 05:49:26.612 region:rollup2
INCARCERATED PEOPLE FOR LONGER

05:49:25.244 --> 05:49:28.314 region:rollup2
PERIODS OF TIME.

05:49:26.612 --> 05:49:30.016 region:rollup2
WE HAVE DESTROYED FAMILIES AND

05:49:28.314 --> 05:49:32.185 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WE'VE TAKEN AWAY THE

05:49:30.016 --> 05:49:33.853 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION OF SO MAD MANY HOME

05:49:32.185 --> 05:49:35.688 region:rollup2
SIMPLY BY INCARCERATION.

05:49:33.853 --> 05:49:37.323 region:rollup2
WE CONDEMN YOUNG PEOPLE EARLY IN

05:49:35.688 --> 05:49:38.558 region:rollup2
LIFE AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT

05:49:37.323 --> 05:49:39.959 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU DO THAT THERE IS NO

05:49:38.558 --> 05:49:41.727 region:rollup2
POSITIVE RESULT THE WEEK THAT

05:49:39.959 --> 05:49:43.663 region:rollup2
COMES OUT OF IT.

05:49:41.727 --> 05:49:44.730 region:rollup2
A PERSON IS BROKEN FOR MANY MANY

05:49:43.663 --> 05:49:46.999 region:rollup2
YEARS IF THEY EVER RECOVERED

05:49:44.730 --> 05:49:48.034 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES.

05:49:46.999 --> 05:49:49.669 region:rollup2
IN MY OTHER LIFE I USED TO SING

05:49:48.034 --> 05:49:51.337 region:rollup2
IN PRISONS.

05:49:49.669 --> 05:49:52.939 region:rollup2
AND I WENT TO LOTS OF PRISONS

05:49:51.337 --> 05:49:54.073 region:rollup2
EVERY SUNDAY AT DIRECTOR ACQUIRE

05:49:52.939 --> 05:49:56.008 region:rollup2
THAT WENT TO PRISONS WHERE

05:49:54.073 --> 05:49:56.909 region:rollup2
PRISON MINISTRY.

05:49:56.008 --> 05:49:58.878 region:rollup2
AND I HAVE THE UNFORTUNATE

05:49:56.909 --> 05:50:00.179 region:rollup2
PLEASURE OIL OR FORTUNATE IN

05:49:58.878 --> 05:50:01.914 region:rollup2
SOME SENSE TO MEET SOME YOUNG

05:50:00.179 --> 05:50:04.417 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WOULD BEEN INCARCERATED

05:50:01.914 --> 05:50:05.952 region:rollup2
FOR TEN FIFTEEN YEARS.

05:50:04.417 --> 05:50:07.086 region:rollup2
AND TO WATCH THEIR BEHAVIOR.

05:50:05.952 --> 05:50:08.821 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THEY HAD MISSED

05:50:07.086 --> 05:50:10.156 region:rollup2
OUT ON SO MUCH OF LIFE.

05:50:08.821 --> 05:50:12.525 region:rollup2
SMALL THINGS THEY WOULD

05:50:10.156 --> 05:50:13.526 region:rollup2
BASICALLY IMMATURE NO THINKING.

05:50:12.525 --> 05:50:15.027 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO HAD BEEN ABUSED

05:50:13.526 --> 05:50:17.063 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE IN THE

05:50:15.027 --> 05:50:18.664 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

05:50:17.063 --> 05:50:20.266 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS NOT A PRETTY PICTURE.

05:50:18.664 --> 05:50:22.768 region:rollup2
AND I REALIZE IS THAT SEVERAL OF

05:50:20.266 --> 05:50:23.369 region:rollup2
THEM THAT I SAW WHO WOULD IN A

05:50:22.768 --> 05:50:24.003 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN AND NOW WE

05:50:23.369 --> 05:50:25.204 region:rollup2
KNOW THIRTIES.

05:50:24.003 --> 05:50:27.106 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THE TRAGEDY THAT WE

05:50:25.204 --> 05:50:28.674 region:rollup2
HAVE LOST A LIFE.

05:50:27.106 --> 05:50:30.610 region:rollup2
AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE IS A NATION

05:50:28.674 --> 05:50:31.878 region:rollup2
AND A STATE WE CAN DO BETTER.

05:50:30.610 --> 05:50:33.045 region:rollup2
WHEN HOUSING GOT A ONE TIME I

05:50:31.878 --> 05:50:34.180 region:rollup2
WOULD TO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE

05:50:33.045 --> 05:50:35.781 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT TO OBSERVE WHAT THEY

05:50:34.180 --> 05:50:36.883 region:rollup2
WERE DOING?

05:50:35.781 --> 05:50:37.884 region:rollup2
AND WAS REALLY QUITE INTERESTING

05:50:36.883 --> 05:50:39.185 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEIR ASSUMPTION IN A

05:50:37.884 --> 05:50:41.020 region:rollup2
SOCIETY.

05:50:39.185 --> 05:50:42.255 region:rollup2
IS THAT WHEN THEIR CHILDREN DO

05:50:41.020 --> 05:50:44.123 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT ARE WRONG.

05:50:42.255 --> 05:50:44.690 region:rollup2
IT IS A DIRECT REFLECTION UPON

05:50:44.123 --> 05:50:45.992 region:rollup2
THE FAMILIES FROM WHICH THEY

05:50:44.690 --> 05:50:47.493 region:rollup2
COME.

05:50:45.992 --> 05:50:48.995 region:rollup2
AND THEY'VE BEEN BEGIN TO WORK

05:50:47.493 --> 05:50:50.663 region:rollup2
WITH THE FAMILY AND THE CHILD IN

05:50:48.995 --> 05:50:52.565 region:rollup2
THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO

05:50:50.663 --> 05:50:53.332 region:rollup2
RESTORE THAT FAMILY AND RESTORE

05:50:52.565 --> 05:50:55.134 region:rollup2
THE CHILD BACK TO BEING A

05:50:53.332 --> 05:50:56.502 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVE CITIZEN.

05:50:55.134 --> 05:50:58.204 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T INCARCERATE THEM AND

05:50:56.502 --> 05:50:59.572 region:rollup2
THROW THEM AWAY THAT SEVERAL THE

05:50:58.204 --> 05:51:00.706 region:rollup2
SOAPS FACILITIES IN OUR CROWD

05:50:59.572 --> 05:51:02.008 region:rollup2
THAT I VISITED.

05:51:00.706 --> 05:51:03.309 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS INTERESTING TO WATCH

05:51:02.008 --> 05:51:04.610 region:rollup2
THE YOUNG PEOPLE AS THEY BEGIN

05:51:03.309 --> 05:51:06.212 region:rollup2
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WAS MISSING

05:51:04.610 --> 05:51:08.080 region:rollup2
IN THE LIVES OF THE FAMILY WAS

05:51:06.212 --> 05:51:09.882 region:rollup2
MISSING IN THE LIVES OF OF THE

05:51:08.080 --> 05:51:11.617 region:rollup2
CHILDREN AND WHAT SKILLS WERE

05:51:09.882 --> 05:51:12.251 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED FOR THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE

05:51:11.617 --> 05:51:13.052 region:rollup2
AND TRYING TO RESTORE NOT JUST

05:51:12.251 --> 05:51:14.120 region:rollup2
THEM.

05:51:13.052 --> 05:51:15.855 region:rollup2
BUT RESTORE THEIR FAMILIES BACK

05:51:14.120 --> 05:51:18.291 region:rollup2
TO BEING [inaudible]

05:51:15.855 --> 05:51:19.792 region:rollup2
THEY BELIEVE THESE CHILDREN ARE

05:51:18.291 --> 05:51:21.160 region:rollup2
REALLY THE PRODUCT OF THEIR

05:51:19.792 --> 05:51:23.696 region:rollup2
FAMILIES AND IF THE TRUCK

05:51:21.160 --> 05:51:24.297 region:rollup2
TOGGLES ASTRAY THE MAYBE TO WORK

05:51:23.696 --> 05:51:25.364 region:rollup2
TO RESTORE THE FAMILY AND THE

05:51:24.297 --> 05:51:25.965 region:rollup2
CHILD.

05:51:25.364 --> 05:51:28.034 region:rollup2
I WAS MOST IMPRESSED WITH THAT

05:51:25.965 --> 05:51:29.769 region:rollup2
SYSTEM BECAUSE I SAW YOUNG

05:51:28.034 --> 05:51:31.370 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BEING RESTORED AND I SAW

05:51:29.769 --> 05:51:32.972 region:rollup2
FAMILIES BEING RESTORED AND I

05:51:31.370 --> 05:51:34.807 region:rollup2
SAW WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN A

05:51:32.972 --> 05:51:37.076 region:rollup2
CIVILIZED SOCIETY.

05:51:34.807 --> 05:51:38.511 region:rollup2
WE CAN AND WE MUST DO BETTER.

WE CANNOT CONTINUE DOWN THIS

05:51:38.511 --> 05:51:41.213 region:rollup2
PATH AND TO HAVE THE VICIOUS

05:51:39.779 --> 05:51:42.615 region:rollup2
IDEA THAT WE CAN JUST THROW

05:51:41.213 --> 05:51:44.483 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AWAY BECAUSE WE DON'T

05:51:42.615 --> 05:51:45.818 region:rollup2

PERPETRATED THE CRIME WAS NOW

05:51:47.219 --> 05:51:48.955 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE A VICTIM OF THE

05:51:48.120 --> 05:51:50.823 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

05:51:48.955 --> 05:51:52.425 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO WORK

05:51:50.823 --> 05:51:53.993 region:rollup2
HARD TO RESTORED TO GIVE OUR

05:51:52.425 --> 05:51:54.927 region:rollup2

HAVE POOR LITERACY SKILLS WE'VE

05:51:59.432 --> 05:52:02.068 region:rollup2
DONE A POOR JOB IN EDUCATING

05:52:01.067 --> 05:52:03.736 region:rollup2
THEM IN OUR SCHOOLS.

05:52:02.068 --> 05:52:04.804 region:rollup2

WORKING WITH POOR INCOME THEY

05:52:08.874 --> 05:52:11.610 region:rollup2
HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT THEY

05:52:10.509 --> 05:52:12.178 region:rollup2

05:52:11.610 --> 05:52:13.012 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

05:52:12.178 --> 05:52:14.013 region:rollup2

HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ELSE.

05:52:18.250 --> 05:52:20.353 region:rollup2
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THESE ARE OUR

05:52:18.884 --> 05:52:21.687 region:rollup2

OUR DISTRICT BUT THIS REALLY.

05:54:07.526 --> 05:54:10.362 region:rollup2
IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE

05:54:08.694 --> 05:54:12.531 region:rollup2

05:54:12.531 --> 05:54:15.935 region:rollup2
HORTON.

05:54:14.333 --> 05:54:18.904 region:rollup2
SCARE TACTICS THAT WE SEE THAT

05:54:15.935 --> 05:54:20.439 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE BOTH. FOR PEOPLE AND

05:54:23.776 --> 05:54:28.047 region:rollup2
THAT THESE TYPES OF POLICIES

05:54:25.945 --> 05:54:29.248 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE OR NOT.

05:54:28.047 --> 05:54:30.616 region:rollup2
BY NOT SUPPORTING A BILL LIKE

05:54:29.248 --> 05:54:32.818 region:rollup2
THIS.

05:54:30.616 --> 05:54:34.320 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN.

05:54:32.818 --> 05:54:34.854 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIFTEEN AND

05:54:34.320 --> 05:54:36.422 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD WE'RE NOT

05:54:34.854 --> 05:54:38.958 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE

05:54:36.422 --> 05:54:40.493 region:rollup2
HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

05:54:38.958 --> 05:54:41.026 region:rollup2
WE'RE JUST SAYING BUT THEY

05:54:40.493 --> 05:54:42.695 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT BE TREATED LIKE

05:54:41.026 --> 05:54:44.997 region:rollup2
ADULTS.

05:54:42.695 --> 05:54:46.665 region:rollup2
AND PUT INTO A SYSTEM.

05:54:44.997 --> 05:54:49.568 region:rollup2
WHERE WE WILL SEE?

05:54:46.665 --> 05:54:52.104 region:rollup2
DETRIMENTAL AFFECTS.

05:54:49.568 --> 05:54:53.139 region:rollup2
AND ULTIMATELY SEE AN INDIVIDUAL

05:54:52.104 --> 05:54:54.840 region:rollup2
RETURNED BACK INTO THE

05:54:53.139 --> 05:54:57.843 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION.

05:54:54.840 --> 05:55:00.246 region:rollup2
AND THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THAT IS

05:54:57.843 --> 05:55:02.014 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WHO UNFORTUNATELY WILL

05:55:00.246 --> 05:55:02.748 region:rollup2
NOT BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE

05:55:02.014 --> 05:55:04.683 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES BACK INTO OUR

05:55:02.748 --> 05:55:06.218 region:rollup2

GROWING UP.

05:55:10.723 --> 05:55:13.392 region:rollup2
IN THE BODY HEALS OF PORCELLO

05:55:11.690 --> 05:55:15.094 region:rollup2
WHERE.

05:55:13.392 --> 05:55:16.395 region:rollup2
MY BEST FRIENDS WHO LIVED ACROSS

05:55:15.094 --> 05:55:18.130 region:rollup2
THE STREET THEIR MOTHER SOLD

05:55:16.395 --> 05:55:20.099 region:rollup2
HEROIN [inaudible]

DOMESTIC ABUSER.

05:55:22.101 --> 05:55:26.939 region:rollup2

PERSON HALF. TO BE ABLE.

05:55:26.939 --> 05:55:31.744 region:rollup2
TO GO ON A POSITIVE TRAJECTORY.

05:55:29.975 --> 05:55:32.645 region:rollup2
AND ULTIMATELY HAVE THE SAME

05:55:31.744 --> 05:55:34.313 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES THAT MANY OF US

05:55:32.645 --> 05:55:36.182 region:rollup2
HAVE HAD [inaudible]

05:55:34.313 --> 05:55:38.417 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY.

05:55:36.182 --> 05:55:40.085 region:rollup2
THEY GOT NO LEG UP.

05:55:38.417 --> 05:55:42.822 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

05:55:40.085 --> 05:55:44.323 region:rollup2
MANY YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR.

05:55:42.822 --> 05:55:46.525 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE

05:55:44.323 --> 05:55:48.994 region:rollup2
IMPACTED BY.

05:55:46.525 --> 05:55:51.597 region:rollup2
I HAVE A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD.

05:55:48.994 --> 05:55:52.832 region:rollup2
AND HIS MOTHER AND I HAVE CALL

05:55:51.597 --> 05:55:54.834 region:rollup2
PARENTED HIM FOR THE LAST

05:55:52.832 --> 05:55:56.836 region:rollup2
[inaudible] TEN YEARS.

05:55:54.834 --> 05:55:58.604 region:rollup2
AND CREDIT TO HER FOR THE WORK

05:55:56.836 --> 05:55:59.705 region:rollup2
THAT SHE'S DONE TO MAKE SURE

05:55:58.604 --> 05:56:01.473 region:rollup2
THAT THAT BOY IS ON TRACK AND ON

05:55:59.705 --> 05:56:03.175 region:rollup2
POINT.

05:56:01.473 --> 05:56:05.411 region:rollup2
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU I THINK

05:56:03.175 --> 05:56:07.279 region:rollup2
ABOUT HIM EVERY SINGLE DAY.

05:56:05.411 --> 05:56:08.914 region:rollup2
AND I THINK BACK TO THE THINGS

05:56:07.279 --> 05:56:10.216 region:rollup2
THAT I GOT TO SEE AN EXPERIENCE

05:56:08.914 --> 05:56:12.017 region:rollup2
WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD AND

05:56:10.216 --> 05:56:14.153 region:rollup2
I WOULD NEVER.

05:56:12.017 --> 05:56:15.955 region:rollup2
EVER WANT HIM TO BE PUT IN THOSE

05:56:14.153 --> 05:56:17.890 region:rollup2
TYPES OF PREDICAMENTS AND

05:56:15.955 --> 05:56:20.059 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MAYBE BEING AT THE WRONG

05:56:17.890 --> 05:56:22.127 region:rollup2
PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME.

05:56:20.059 --> 05:56:23.862 region:rollup2
HANGING OUT WITH SOMEONE. ONE

05:56:22.127 --> 05:56:26.031 region:rollup2
AFTERNOON AND SOMETHING TERRIBLY

05:56:23.862 --> 05:56:27.633 region:rollup2
GOES DOWN.

05:56:26.031 --> 05:56:29.201 region:rollup2
MY SON ALTHOUGH YOU SEEN HIM

05:56:27.633 --> 05:56:30.703 region:rollup2
HE'S A LITTLE TALLER THAN ME

05:56:29.201 --> 05:56:32.071 region:rollup2
HE'S GOT A BIGGER MUSTACHE THAN

05:56:30.703 --> 05:56:33.806 region:rollup2
HALF OF YOU HERE HE'S A LITTLE

05:56:32.071 --> 05:56:34.573 region:rollup2
KID.

05:56:33.806 --> 05:56:36.675 region:rollup2
SITTING IN FRONT OF THE VIDEO

05:56:34.573 --> 05:56:38.811 region:rollup2
GAMES.

05:56:36.675 --> 05:56:40.012 region:rollup2
DOING HIS HOMEWORK.

05:56:38.811 --> 05:56:41.680 region:rollup2
YEAH EVERY NOW AND THEN IS A

05:56:40.012 --> 05:56:43.115 region:rollup2
TEENAGER WHO KINDA GETS A LITTLE

05:56:41.680 --> 05:56:44.850 region:rollup2
SNAPPY HIM THERE BUT HE'S A

05:56:43.115 --> 05:56:47.019 region:rollup2
LITTLE BOY.

05:56:44.850 --> 05:56:48.888 region:rollup2
AND I CAN IMAGINE HIM BEING HELD

05:56:47.019 --> 05:56:50.289 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE OR RESPONSIBLE FOR

05:56:48.888 --> 05:56:52.057 region:rollup2
INACTION WHERE HE'S TREATED LIKE

05:56:50.289 --> 05:56:54.927 region:rollup2
AN ADULT.

05:56:52.057 --> 05:56:55.527 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

05:56:54.927 --> 05:56:56.895 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S WITH HIS BILL IS

05:56:55.527 --> 05:56:59.798 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

05:56:56.895 --> 05:57:01.567 region:rollup2
IS GIVING PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY.

05:56:59.798 --> 05:57:03.335 region:rollup2
TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND

05:57:01.567 --> 05:57:06.238 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS

05:57:03.335 --> 05:57:07.907 region:rollup2
BUT DONE SO IN A WAY IN WHICH IT

THE PROJECT.

08:40:56.759 --> 08:41:01.731 region:rollup2
LOCAL SPRINGS BRIAN RESOURCES IN

08:41:00.296 --> 08:41:04.033 region:rollup2
BRISTOL AND COULD THESE DRY

08:41:01.731 --> 08:41:05.801 region:rollup2
LAKES AIR QUALITY VEGETATION IN

08:41:04.033 --> 08:41:08.838 region:rollup2
THE MOJAVE DESERT REGION AND

08:41:05.801 --> 08:41:09.638 region:rollup2
ALSO AFFECTED ADJACENT AREAS.

08:41:08.838 --> 08:41:13.642 region:rollup2
ALONG THE COLORADO RIVER AND ITS

08:41:09.638 --> 08:41:16.045 region:rollup2
TRIBUTARIES.

08:41:13.642 --> 08:41:18.280 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD ADD TWO MORE REVIEWS

08:41:16.045 --> 08:41:19.715 region:rollup2
TO THE SECRET PROJECTS DISREGARD

08:41:18.280 --> 08:41:21.584 region:rollup2
DE THOROUGH SECRET PROCESS THAT

08:41:19.715 --> 08:41:23.052 region:rollup2
WAS APPROVED.

08:41:21.584 --> 08:41:24.487 region:rollup2
TIME AND TIME AGAIN WE GO BACK

08:41:23.052 --> 08:41:27.189 region:rollup2
TO SEE QUIRK AND WE DEMAND

08:41:24.487 --> 08:41:29.692 region:rollup2
PROJECTS GO THROUGH IT.

08:41:27.189 --> 08:41:31.927 region:rollup2
SOME WE EXEMPT FROM SEQUEL BUT

08:41:29.692 --> 08:41:33.429 region:rollup2
THIS ONE WAS APPROVED BY SEQUEL

08:41:31.927 --> 08:41:34.163 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE GOLD STANDARD AND

08:41:33.429 --> 08:41:36.966 region:rollup2
NOW WE'RE SAYING.

08:41:34.163 --> 08:41:38.901 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S NOT.

08:41:36.966 --> 08:41:40.503 region:rollup2
IF THIS PROJECT COULD RESULT IN

08:41:38.901 --> 08:41:43.272 region:rollup2
THE SIX POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR

08:41:40.503 --> 08:41:45.107 region:rollup2
SAVINGS AND AVOID COSTS OVER A

08:41:43.272 --> 08:41:47.143 region:rollup2
FIFTY YEAR PERIOD DISTANCE DOT

08:41:45.107 --> 08:41:49.111 region:rollup2
AFFECT ANY OF THE SACRED

08:41:47.143 --> 08:41:51.080 region:rollup2
MONUMENTS IN THE DESERT.

08:41:49.111 --> 08:41:52.615 region:rollup2
THIS IS BAD PRECEDENT ANY OTHER

08:41:51.080 --> 08:41:54.450 region:rollup2
PROJECT IN YOUR DISTRICT TO GOES

08:41:52.615 --> 08:41:55.484 region:rollup2
TO SEE GROW. ONE DAY SOMEBODY

08:41:54.450 --> 08:41:56.952 region:rollup2
COULD COME AND SAY NOT THAT

08:41:55.484 --> 08:42:00.256 region:rollup2
WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH LET'S DO IT

08:41:56.952 --> 08:42:00.756 region:rollup2
AGAIN I ASK FOR NO THE MR

DISTRICT.

08:42:06.462 --> 08:42:09.965 region:rollup2
SO I KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS

08:42:07.830 --> 08:42:11.267 region:rollup2
PROJECT.

08:42:09.965 --> 08:42:13.936 region:rollup2
AND I ASSURE YOU IT IS

08:42:11.267 --> 08:42:14.503 region:rollup2
EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLEX.

08:42:13.936 --> 08:42:16.138 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES TO

08:42:14.503 --> 08:42:17.006 region:rollup2
CONSIDER HERE.

08:42:16.138 --> 08:42:18.374 region:rollup2
I HAVE TO OBJECT TO THIS BILL

08:42:17.006 --> 08:42:19.542 region:rollup2
JUST.

08:42:18.374 --> 08:42:21.610 region:rollup2
ON THE BASIS OF THE PROCESS WERE

08:42:19.542 --> 08:42:23.913 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING.

08:42:21.610 --> 08:42:25.548 region:rollup2
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS.

08:42:23.913 --> 08:42:27.283 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT A PRIVATE PARTY THAT

08:42:25.548 --> 08:42:29.251 region:rollup2
OWN SOME PRIVATE LAND AND THEY

08:42:27.283 --> 08:42:30.953 region:rollup2
HAVE INVESTED MILLIONS AND

08:42:29.251 --> 08:42:33.956 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

08:42:30.953 --> 08:42:35.224 region:rollup2
IN TRYING TO DEVELOP A PROJECT.

08:42:33.956 --> 08:42:37.459 region:rollup2
THEY'VE GONE THROUGH EXHAUSTIVE

08:42:35.224 --> 08:42:38.627 region:rollup2
REVIEW BOTH ENVIRONMENTALLY AND

08:42:37.459 --> 08:42:40.196 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE THEY'VE GONE FOR

08:42:38.627 --> 08:42:41.864 region:rollup2
REVIEW BY THE COUNTY SAN BERTINO

08:42:40.196 --> 08:42:42.965 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN REVIEWED --

08:42:41.864 --> 08:42:44.266 region:rollup2
WITH SEQUEL WITH US

08:42:42.965 --> 08:42:46.202 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT

08:42:44.266 --> 08:42:47.703 region:rollup2
THEY'VE GOT A FILE A FEDERAL

08:42:46.202 --> 08:42:48.704 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT THAT

08:42:47.703 --> 08:42:50.706 region:rollup2
THEY'VE GONE THROUGH.

08:42:48.704 --> 08:42:52.508 region:rollup2
ITS TAKEN THEM YEARS AND YEARS

08:42:50.706 --> 08:42:54.210 region:rollup2
TO GET TO THIS POINT.

08:42:52.508 --> 08:42:55.277 region:rollup2
AND AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE.

08:42:54.210 --> 08:42:57.279 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA PULL THE RUG OUT

08:42:55.277 --> 08:42:58.881 region:rollup2
FROM UNDER THEIR FEET.

08:42:57.279 --> 08:42:59.982 region:rollup2
AND TELL THEM THAT THEY HAVE TO

08:42:58.881 --> 08:43:01.951 region:rollup2
DO MORE THEY CAN'T GO FORWARD

08:42:59.982 --> 08:43:03.152 region:rollup2
THAT'S WRONG.

08:43:01.951 --> 08:43:04.353 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT

08:43:03.152 --> 08:43:04.887 region:rollup2

AGAINST THE PROJECT THAT'S

08:43:04.887 --> 08:43:08.457 region:rollup2
WRONG.

08:43:06.956 --> 08:43:10.059 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T GIVE THOSE PART OF

08:43:08.457 --> 08:43:11.260 region:rollup2
THOSE PEOPLE DUE PROCESS AND

08:43:10.059 --> 08:43:13.162 region:rollup2
IT'S DEPRIVING THEM OF THE FAIR

08:43:11.260 --> 08:43:15.130 region:rollup2
USE OF THEIR PROPERTY.

08:43:13.162 --> 08:43:17.366 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT RIGHT TO INTRODUCE A

08:43:15.130 --> 08:43:19.768 region:rollup2

THAT BILL WENT THROUGH

08:43:28.777 --> 08:43:31.447 region:rollup2

VIEWPOINT FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM

08:44:47.690 --> 08:44:50.559 region:rollup2
BIG BEAR LAKE THAT REPRESENTS

08:44:49.058 --> 08:44:52.761 region:rollup2
THE AREA IN PARTICULAR.

08:44:50.559 --> 08:44:54.263 region:rollup2
BUT BY PROHIBITING THIS TRANSFER

08:44:52.761 --> 08:44:55.798 region:rollup2
FOR THE KIDDIES PROJECT THIS

08:44:54.263 --> 08:44:57.032 region:rollup2
BILL PROPOSES TO ELIMINATE A

08:44:55.798 --> 08:44:59.702 region:rollup2
SUPPLY OF WATER THAT COULD MEET

08:44:57.032 --> 08:45:00.269 region:rollup2
THE NEEDS. FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND

08:44:59.702 --> 08:45:02.004 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ANNUALLY IN SOUTHERN

08:45:00.269 --> 08:45:03.405 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

08:45:02.004 --> 08:45:05.040 region:rollup2
THE PROJECT WATER SUPPLIES COULD

08:45:03.405 --> 08:45:07.076 region:rollup2
RESULT IN SIX POINT ONE BILLION

08:45:05.040 --> 08:45:09.812 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN SAVINGS.

08:45:07.076 --> 08:45:11.013 region:rollup2
AND AVOIDED COSTS OVER A FIFTY

08:45:09.812 --> 08:45:12.614 region:rollup2
YEAR PERIOD.

08:45:11.013 --> 08:45:13.682 region:rollup2
THESE BENEFITS WOULD NOT ONLY BE

08:45:12.614 --> 08:45:15.617 region:rollup2
REALIZED BY THE PROJECT

08:45:13.682 --> 08:45:17.019 region:rollup2
SUBSCRIBERS BUT EXPERIENCED BY

08:45:15.617 --> 08:45:18.921 region:rollup2
ALL WATER USERS THROUGHOUT THE

08:45:17.019 --> 08:45:20.089 region:rollup2

08:45:18.921 --> 08:45:21.790 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF COURSE.

08:45:20.089 --> 08:45:22.958 region:rollup2
THIS IMPACTS ALL OF US IN

08:45:21.790 --> 08:45:24.893 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE NEED FOR

08:45:22.958 --> 08:45:26.295 region:rollup2
WATER.

08:45:24.893 --> 08:45:28.130 region:rollup2
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS IS

08:45:26.295 --> 08:45:29.898 region:rollup2
PRECEDENT SETTING WELL THIS BILL

08:45:28.130 --> 08:45:31.700 region:rollup2
CONTINUES.

08:45:29.898 --> 08:45:33.936 region:rollup2
OR PERTAINS TO THE COULD THESE

08:45:31.700 --> 08:45:35.704 region:rollup2
WATER PROJECT IT SETS THE TABLE

08:45:33.936 --> 08:45:38.607 region:rollup2
FOR FUTURE LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS

08:45:35.704 --> 08:45:39.742 region:rollup2
TO MAKE END RUNS AROUND SI KHOA.

08:45:38.607 --> 08:45:41.610 region:rollup2
AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM DANA POINT.

08:45:39.742 --> 08:45:44.046 region:rollup2
POINTED OUT.

08:45:41.610 --> 08:45:46.015 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE SPENT THE MONEY.

08:45:44.046 --> 08:45:48.017 region:rollup2
I GET THE APPROVALS UNDER THE

08:45:46.015 --> 08:45:49.752 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND ALL THIS DOES IS IT

08:45:48.017 --> 08:45:51.987 region:rollup2
JUST CRUMPLES UP THAT PAPER AND

08:45:49.752 --> 08:45:54.056 region:rollup2
THROWS IT OUT.

08:45:51.987 --> 08:45:56.392 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IN OUR

08:45:54.056 --> 08:45:58.460 region:rollup2
STATE IS KEY WHETHER IT'S ENERGY

08:45:56.392 --> 08:46:00.129 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S WATER WHETHER IT'S

08:45:58.460 --> 08:46:01.997 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION.

08:46:00.129 --> 08:46:03.232 region:rollup2
BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO PULL THE

08:46:01.997 --> 08:46:04.933 region:rollup2
RUG FROM UNDER OUR PROJECTS LIKE

08:46:03.232 --> 08:46:06.835 region:rollup2
THIS.

08:46:04.933 --> 08:46:08.037 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD SAY GOODBYE TO ANYBODY

08:46:06.835 --> 08:46:09.972 region:rollup2
WHO WANTS TO INVEST IN

08:46:08.037 --> 08:46:11.607 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FOR INFRASTRUCTURE

08:46:09.972 --> 08:46:13.742 region:rollup2
PROJECTS LIKE THIS BECAUSE THEY

08:46:11.607 --> 08:46:15.711 region:rollup2
WON'T BE ABLE TO TRUST THE STATE

08:46:13.742 --> 08:46:16.912 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA AFTER YOU PUT IN

08:46:15.711 --> 08:46:18.447 region:rollup2
THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BE

08:46:16.912 --> 08:46:21.817 region:rollup2
ABLE TO HAVE THE APPROVALS.

08:46:18.447 --> 08:46:22.985 region:rollup2
HERE WITHIN THIS STATE.

08:46:21.817 --> 08:46:24.620 region:rollup2
I GET IT THAT THIS PROJECT MIGHT

08:46:22.985 --> 08:46:25.988 region:rollup2
NEED NOT BE POPULAR AMONG SOME

08:46:24.620 --> 08:46:27.556 region:rollup2
OF THE MAJORITY.

08:46:25.988 --> 08:46:29.324 region:rollup2
MIGHT NOT BE POPULAR MAKING A

08:46:27.556 --> 08:46:30.893 region:rollup2

PULL THE RUG FROM UNDER THIS

08:46:34.596 --> 08:46:39.735 region:rollup2
PROJECT IN THIS WAY IT IS WRONG.

08:46:38.200 --> 08:46:42.337 region:rollup2
IT IS UNFAIR.

08:46:39.735 --> 08:46:44.773 region:rollup2

08:46:42.337 --> 08:46:46.742 region:rollup2

08:46:44.773 --> 08:46:48.143 region:rollup2

08:47:28.917 --> 08:47:33.122 region:rollup2
AND THE VEIL ABILITY OF WATER --

08:47:31.186 --> 08:47:34.923 region:rollup2

HAS FINALLY GOT A PATH TO MOVE

08:47:48.237 --> 08:47:52.508 region:rollup2

08:47:52.508 --> 08:47:56.745 region:rollup2
TAKING A PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS

THE PROJECT IS ALL ON PRIVATE

08:47:56.745 --> 08:48:00.582 region:rollup2
LANDS NOT PUBLIC LANDS.

08:47:59.047 --> 08:48:02.150 region:rollup2
THIS BILL SO ITS A PRECEDENCE

08:48:00.582 --> 08:48:03.619 region:rollup2

TO SEEK WHILE.

08:48:07.256 --> 08:48:10.359 region:rollup2
THIS CAN HAPPEN TO ANY WATER

08:48:08.390 --> 08:48:11.994 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT OF THIS

08:48:10.359 --> 08:48:13.829 region:rollup2

TEMPERANCE FLAT.

08:48:15.864 --> 08:48:19.535 region:rollup2
THE DIESEL PLANTS THAT ALREADY

08:48:17.599 --> 08:48:22.237 region:rollup2
TAKE LONG ENOUGH IN MY DISTRICT

08:48:19.535 --> 08:48:24.273 region:rollup2
TO BE IN MY AREA TO BE APPROVED.

08:48:22.237 --> 08:48:26.074 region:rollup2
THIS PROJECT INCREASES

08:48:24.273 --> 08:48:27.442 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S WATER SUPPLY.

08:48:26.074 --> 08:48:28.677 region:rollup2
KILLING THIS PROJECT WILL

08:48:27.442 --> 08:48:30.312 region:rollup2
INCREASE PRESSURE ON

CALIFORNIA.

08:48:33.649 --> 08:48:36.685 region:rollup2
THE LAST THING WE SHOULD BE

08:48:34.216 --> 08:48:38.520 region:rollup2
DOING IS REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF

08:48:36.685 --> 08:48:39.955 region:rollup2
WATER AVAILABLE TO OUR CITIZENS

08:48:38.520 --> 08:48:41.123 region:rollup2

MAKE A FINDING THAT THE TRANSFER

08:49:02.978 --> 08:49:06.515 region:rollup2
WILL OF WATER FROM THE

08:49:04.746 --> 08:49:08.483 region:rollup2
UNDERGROUND BASE IN UNDERLYING

08:49:06.515 --> 08:49:09.718 region:rollup2
DESERT LANDS WILL NOT ADVERSELY

LANDS PRIOR TO THE TRANSFER

08:49:15.290 --> 08:49:18.493 region:rollup2
BEING ALLOWED.

08:49:17.159 --> 08:49:19.895 region:rollup2
THE DESERT ECOSYSTEM AND KNOW

08:49:18.493 --> 08:49:21.430 region:rollup2
MOJAVE DESERT IS EXTREMELY

08:49:19.895 --> 08:49:23.031 region:rollup2
FRAGILE.

08:49:21.430 --> 08:49:25.100 region:rollup2
SMALL CHANGES CAN HAVE

08:49:23.031 --> 08:49:26.435 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS I'M

08:49:25.100 --> 08:49:28.170 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN

08:49:26.435 --> 08:49:30.639 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT STUDIES THAT RANGE

08:49:28.170 --> 08:49:32.174 region:rollup2
WIDELY AND POTENTIAL IMPACT.

08:49:30.639 --> 08:49:34.076 region:rollup2
THAT COULD THESE PROJECT COULD

08:49:32.174 --> 08:49:35.744 region:rollup2
HAVE ON THE ECOSYSTEM.

08:49:34.076 --> 08:49:37.980 region:rollup2
HAVING THE ADDITIONAL STUDY OF A

08:49:35.744 --> 08:49:39.648 region:rollup2
PROJECT AFFECTING STATE LANDS

08:49:37.980 --> 08:49:40.082 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY FOR FRAGILE.

08:49:39.648 --> 08:49:41.850 region:rollup2
DESERT ECOSYSTEMS IS

08:49:40.082 --> 08:49:43.685 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE.

08:49:41.850 --> 08:49:45.387 region:rollup2
SO WE DON'T INADVERTENTLY CAUSE

08:49:43.685 --> 08:49:46.455 region:rollup2
IRREPARABLE HARM.

08:49:45.387 --> 08:49:48.056 region:rollup2
S. B. ONE TWENTY FULFILLS THAT

08:49:46.455 --> 08:49:52.261 region:rollup2
GO.

08:49:48.056 --> 08:49:54.363 region:rollup2
WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR IDEA.

08:49:52.261 --> 08:49:58.033 region:rollup2
NAME IS CHAU.

08:49:54.363 --> 08:49:59.735 region:rollup2
DOCTOR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

08:49:58.033 --> 08:50:00.769 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND AND

08:49:59.735 --> 08:50:02.738 region:rollup2
MEMBERS.

08:50:00.769 --> 08:50:04.473 region:rollup2
I RISE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE

08:50:02.738 --> 08:50:06.308 region:rollup2
THE PIECE OF THIS PIECE OF

08:50:04.473 --> 08:50:06.942 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION SB.

08:50:06.308 --> 08:50:08.410 region:rollup2
ONE TWENTY AND I DO THAT WITHOUT

08:50:06.942 --> 08:50:10.879 region:rollup2
--

08:50:08.410 --> 08:50:12.414 region:rollup2
WITH UNDERSTANDING AT LEAST IN

08:50:10.879 --> 08:50:13.615 region:rollup2
MY MIND THAT --

08:50:12.414 --> 08:50:15.050 region:rollup2
WHEN I WAS APPROACHED BY FOLKS

08:50:13.615 --> 08:50:16.151 region:rollup2
WITH THE COULD THESE PROJECT I

08:50:15.050 --> 08:50:17.486 region:rollup2
WAS INITIALLY IN FAVOR OF WHAT

08:50:16.151 --> 08:50:19.288 region:rollup2
THEY WERE SAYING?

08:50:17.486 --> 08:50:20.856 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN PROCESS AND

08:50:19.288 --> 08:50:22.224 region:rollup2
PROCEDURE AND THAT WHEN YOU

08:50:20.856 --> 08:50:23.525 region:rollup2
AGREE TO A CERTAIN PROCESS IN A

08:50:22.224 --> 08:50:24.760 region:rollup2
PROCEDURE YOU LIVE BY THAT

08:50:23.525 --> 08:50:25.961 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND PROCEDURE.

08:50:24.760 --> 08:50:27.262 region:rollup2
AND I WAS LED TO BELIEVE THAT

08:50:25.961 --> 08:50:28.697 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING WAS IN LINE AND

08:50:27.262 --> 08:50:29.431 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING WAS CORRECT.

08:50:28.697 --> 08:50:30.899 region:rollup2
UNTIL I GOT A COPY OF THE

08:50:29.431 --> 08:50:32.401 region:rollup2
TIMELINE.

08:50:30.899 --> 08:50:33.435 region:rollup2
AND I REALIZE THAT THE FEDERAL

08:50:32.401 --> 08:50:34.670 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT HAD REQUIRED AN

08:50:33.435 --> 08:50:35.504 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL REPORT TO BE DONE THE

08:50:34.670 --> 08:50:36.705 region:rollup2
NEPA.

08:50:35.504 --> 08:50:37.939 region:rollup2
OUT TO BE DONE ON THIS PIECE OF

08:50:36.705 --> 08:50:40.108 region:rollup2
PROPERTY.

08:50:37.939 --> 08:50:41.276 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS IN PLACE TO BE DONE

08:50:40.108 --> 08:50:42.911 region:rollup2
UNTIL OBVIOUSLY ADMINISTRATIONS

08:50:41.276 --> 08:50:44.146 region:rollup2
CHANGED.

08:50:42.911 --> 08:50:46.081 region:rollup2
AND THE LAWS IN THE A CONCERN

08:50:44.146 --> 08:50:47.149 region:rollup2
THE ENVIRONMENT WERE RELAXED.

08:50:46.081 --> 08:50:49.117 region:rollup2
AND THEREFORE THEY WOULD THEN

08:50:47.149 --> 08:50:51.420 region:rollup2
TAKE IT OUT OF THE NEPA PROCESS

08:50:49.117 --> 08:50:52.921 region:rollup2
A BECAUSE OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT.

08:50:51.420 --> 08:50:54.656 region:rollup2
DID NOT OBVIOUSLY OVERTURNED A

08:50:52.921 --> 08:50:55.524 region:rollup2
LOT OF THINGS THAT OBAMA PUT IN

08:50:54.656 --> 08:50:57.726 region:rollup2
PLACE AND ONE OF THINGS PUT IN

08:50:55.524 --> 08:50:58.427 region:rollup2
PLACE WAS THE STUDY FOR THE NEPA

08:50:57.726 --> 08:51:00.462 region:rollup2
BEEPER.

08:50:58.427 --> 08:51:01.697 region:rollup2
OF STUDY TO BE DONE ON THIS

08:51:00.462 --> 08:51:03.165 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR PROJECT.

08:51:01.697 --> 08:51:04.533 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE THAT WAS IN PLACE IN

08:51:03.165 --> 08:51:06.301 region:rollup2
MY MIND THAT ALSO DEFINED THE

08:51:04.533 --> 08:51:07.836 region:rollup2
RULES OF THE GAME.

08:51:06.301 --> 08:51:08.737 region:rollup2
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEN THOSE

08:51:07.836 --> 08:51:10.339 region:rollup2
RULES CHANGE WE GET A NEW

08:51:08.737 --> 08:51:12.074 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT WHO THEN DECIDES TO

08:51:10.339 --> 08:51:14.376 region:rollup2
RELAX ALL THE STANDARDS AND

08:51:12.074 --> 08:51:16.211 region:rollup2
REMOVE THEM FROM THIS PROJECT TO

08:51:14.376 --> 08:51:17.479 region:rollup2
DO THE LAST STUDY THAT'S DONE.

08:51:16.211 --> 08:51:18.246 region:rollup2
SO NOT THAT I'M.

08:51:17.479 --> 08:51:20.482 region:rollup2
NOT AS KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT

08:51:18.246 --> 08:51:21.316 region:rollup2
OTHERS WITH REGARD.

08:51:20.482 --> 08:51:24.286 region:rollup2
FARMERS IN THE WATER IN THIS SO

08:51:21.316 --> 08:51:25.687 region:rollup2
ON BUT I DO BELIEVE IN PROCESS

08:51:24.286 --> 08:51:27.556 region:rollup2
IN THE GAMES AT A BEER.

08:51:25.687 --> 08:51:29.191 region:rollup2
AND THIS GAME WAS IN PLACE FOR

08:51:27.556 --> 08:51:30.659 region:rollup2
THEM TO DO THIS FINAL REPORT.

08:51:29.191 --> 08:51:32.127 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE THEY ONE OF THE

08:51:30.659 --> 08:51:34.296 region:rollup2
PERSONS WHO NOW IS ON THE

08:51:32.127 --> 08:51:36.031 region:rollup2
INTERIOR COMMITTEE IS ONE OF THE

08:51:34.296 --> 08:51:36.865 region:rollup2
OWNERS ARE ADVOCATES OF OF OF

08:51:36.031 --> 08:51:39.167 region:rollup2
THE COULD THESE.

08:51:36.865 --> 08:51:40.602 region:rollup2
THIS WAS THEN TAKEN OFF THE LIST

08:51:39.167 --> 08:51:42.237 region:rollup2
AND THEN PUT ON A HIGHER LISTS

08:51:40.602 --> 08:51:43.305 region:rollup2
OF BASICALLY TO ALLOW THIS

08:51:42.237 --> 08:51:45.907 region:rollup2
PROJECT TO MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT

08:51:43.305 --> 08:51:47.676 region:rollup2
DOING NEPA. TO ME THAT'S UNFAIR.

08:51:45.907 --> 08:51:48.677 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS WAS IN PLACE I

08:51:47.676 --> 08:51:49.544 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT AND THEY

08:51:48.677 --> 08:51:51.580 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED TO DO

08:51:49.544 --> 08:51:52.981 region:rollup2
IT AND FOR THAT REASON AS WE

08:51:51.580 --> 08:51:53.915 region:rollup2
LOOK DEAL WITH AN ADMINISTRATION

08:51:52.981 --> 08:51:54.483 region:rollup2
THAT CONTINUES TO WANT TO

08:51:53.915 --> 08:51:56.118 region:rollup2
RELEASE.

08:51:54.483 --> 08:51:57.386 region:rollup2
AND TO ROUTE TO RELAX ALL OF THE

08:51:56.118 --> 08:51:58.954 region:rollup2
PROCESSES CONCERNING THE

08:51:57.386 --> 08:52:00.622 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT I'M IN FAVOR OF THIS

08:51:58.954 --> 08:52:02.224 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA WE BELIEVE

08:52:00.622 --> 08:52:03.325 region:rollup2
AND PROCESS AND WE BELIEVE IN

08:52:02.224 --> 08:52:04.359 region:rollup2
STUDIES THAT WE BELIEVE IN

08:52:03.325 --> 08:52:05.060 region:rollup2
LOOKING CAREFULLY AT THE

08:52:04.359 --> 08:52:06.128 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT.

08:52:05.060 --> 08:52:07.129 region:rollup2
AND EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE BEEN

11:10:38.231 --> 11:10:42.169 region:rollup2
IT TALKS ABOUT HOW THIS BILL

11:10:40.033 --> 11:10:43.136 region:rollup2
PROVIDES NO EXCEPTION TO ALLOW

11:10:42.169 --> 11:10:45.305 region:rollup2

USED IN A RE SENTENCING HEARING

11:10:45.305 --> 11:10:48.942 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S GOING TO BE. TO

11:10:46.740 --> 11:10:51.144 region:rollup2

ONCE AGAIN TO REOPEN THE PAIN

11:10:57.317 --> 11:11:00.020 region:rollup2
AND SUFFERING THAT THEY WENT

11:10:58.885 --> 11:11:01.455 region:rollup2

11:11:04.291 --> 11:11:08.095 region:rollup2
THE BILL TALKS ABOUT THEIR

11:11:06.026 --> 11:11:09.730 region:rollup2

11:11:08.095 --> 11:11:11.798 region:rollup2
IN CASES THAT RESULT THROUGH A

11:11:09.730 --> 11:11:13.366 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATED PLEA WHICH IS THE

11:11:11.798 --> 11:11:15.368 region:rollup2
VAST MAJORITY OF ALL FELONY

11:11:13.366 --> 11:11:18.472 region:rollup2
CASES.

11:11:15.368 --> 11:11:20.640 region:rollup2
NO SUCH RECORD EXISTS.

11:11:18.472 --> 11:11:23.043 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF TRANSCRIPTS EGGS.

11:11:20.640 --> 11:11:25.512 region:rollup2
COR A COURT RECORD TO RELY ON IN

11:11:23.043 --> 11:11:26.646 region:rollup2
SO VIRTUALLY ALL PARTICIPANTS.

11:11:25.512 --> 11:11:28.381 region:rollup2
AND THESE FELONY MET RUMORS

11:11:26.646 --> 11:11:32.986 region:rollup2
WOULD QUALIFY FOR RELIEF TO

11:11:28.381 --> 11:11:34.988 region:rollup2
WHICH THEY MAY NOT BE ENTITLED.

11:11:32.986 --> 11:11:36.923 region:rollup2
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST.

11:11:34.988 --> 11:11:38.892 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS PLACING THE BURDEN

11:11:36.923 --> 11:11:41.094 region:rollup2
ON THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE

11:11:38.892 --> 11:11:43.063 region:rollup2
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.

11:11:41.094 --> 11:11:44.331 region:rollup2
THE PETITIONERS DO NOT QUALIFY

11:11:43.063 --> 11:11:46.533 region:rollup2
HER RE SENTENCING SO IN OTHER

11:11:44.331 --> 11:11:48.835 region:rollup2

CONVICTED OF FELONY MURDER TO BE

11:11:50.103 --> 11:11:56.343 region:rollup2
RE SENTENCED.

11:11:53.440 --> 11:11:58.445 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT SOLUTION

11:11:56.343 --> 11:12:00.113 region:rollup2
TO THE PROBLEM OF FELONY MURDER

11:11:58.445 --> 11:12:01.948 region:rollup2

11:12:07.053 --> 11:12:12.092 region:rollup2
THIS WELL THIS GOES TOO FAR.

11:12:09.723 --> 11:12:13.860 region:rollup2
IT REOPENS IT REQUIRES CRIME

11:12:12.092 --> 11:12:15.295 region:rollup2
VICTIMS TO HAVE TO RE OPEN THE

11:12:13.860 --> 11:12:16.797 region:rollup2
PAIN.

11:12:15.295 --> 11:12:17.297 region:rollup2

TO TESTIFY ONCE AGAIN TO

11:12:17.297 --> 11:12:24.671 region:rollup2
JUSTIFY.

11:12:19.833 --> 11:12:26.173 region:rollup2
WHY THEY FEEL THAT?

11:12:24.671 --> 11:12:26.473 region:rollup2
THE PERSON SHOULD BE

11:12:26.173 --> 11:12:28.141 region:rollup2

11:12:26.473 --> 11:12:29.943 region:rollup2
BEHIND BARS [inaudible]

11:12:28.141 --> 11:12:31.711 region:rollup2
I ASK.

11:12:29.943 --> 11:12:35.782 region:rollup2

THIS CRITICAL BILL [inaudible]

11:12:41.755 --> 11:12:45.158 region:rollup2
BECAUSE VICTIMS DO MATTER

11:12:44.858 --> 11:12:47.127 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

11:12:45.158 --> 11:12:48.328 region:rollup2
IN VICTIMS.

11:12:47.127 --> 11:12:51.665 region:rollup2

WHEN SOMEBODY IS KILLED?

11:13:03.176 --> 11:13:08.548 region:rollup2
AND THAT HAS HAPPENED AGAIN.

11:13:06.246 --> 11:13:10.650 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.

11:13:08.548 --> 11:13:11.618 region:rollup2
I VENTURE TO SAY ANY OF US.

11:13:10.650 --> 11:13:13.486 region:rollup2
WHO WENT TO LAW SCHOOL WHEN WE

FIRST?

11:13:13.486 --> 11:13:15.956 region:rollup2
STARTED CRIMINAL LAW AND LEARNED

11:13:14.788 --> 11:13:17.958 region:rollup2

WE'RE EXPOSED HOW ARCHAIC.

11:13:20.126 --> 11:13:25.131 region:rollup2
IN I'M JUST IT COULD BE.

11:13:23.663 --> 11:13:27.968 region:rollup2
I KNOW BECAUSE THE CASE LAWS

THAT WE SAW WERE ALWAYS.

11:13:27.968 --> 11:13:32.539 region:rollup2
PLEXI WE HAD A LOOK AT HOW

11:13:30.170 --> 11:13:33.974 region:rollup2
PERPLEXING IT WAS TO GET THROUGH

11:13:32.539 --> 11:13:36.176 region:rollup2
THE IDEA THAT CALIFORNIA.

11:13:33.974 --> 11:13:37.410 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAS THIS.

11:13:36.176 --> 11:13:39.212 region:rollup2
AND SIMILAR THINGS BROUGHT UP ON

11:13:37.410 --> 11:13:41.314 region:rollup2
THIS FLOOR.

11:13:39.212 --> 11:13:43.450 region:rollup2
OUR LITTLE I THINK OUTDATED IN

11:13:41.314 --> 11:13:45.619 region:rollup2
THE ANALYSIS BECAUSE I KNOW.

THAT THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN.

11:13:45.619 --> 11:13:50.991 region:rollup2
IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE.

11:13:48.088 --> 11:13:52.959 region:rollup2
ALLOWS THE DA'S A COURT TO USE

11:13:50.991 --> 11:13:55.729 region:rollup2
ALL MATERIALS AND ALL EVIDENCE

11:13:52.959 --> 11:13:57.998 region:rollup2
IN THE RE SENTENCING CASE.

11:13:55.729 --> 11:13:59.766 region:rollup2
THE BURDEN IS ON THE PETITIONER.

11:13:57.998 --> 11:14:01.835 region:rollup2
TO A ALLOW FOR A CASE TO MOVE

11:13:59.766 --> 11:14:03.770 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

11:14:01.835 --> 11:14:05.939 region:rollup2
OF COURSE WE'VE EXEMPTED ALL

11:14:03.770 --> 11:14:07.073 region:rollup2
CASES A DEAL WITH A COP KILLER.

11:14:05.939 --> 11:14:09.209 region:rollup2
SO THERE WERE AMENDMENTS TAKEN

11:14:07.073 --> 11:14:10.543 region:rollup2

11:14:09.209 --> 11:14:11.711 region:rollup2

11:14:14.714 --> 11:14:16.716 region:rollup2
I CAN'T EVER EXPECT SOMETHING

11:14:16.116 --> 11:14:17.717 region:rollup2
