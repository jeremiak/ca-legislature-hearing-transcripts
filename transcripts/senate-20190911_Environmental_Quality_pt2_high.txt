HEREBY CALL TO ORDER. WE HAVE A ONE ITEM BEFORE THE COMMITTEE THIS IS AT AB TWELVE NINETY NINE BY CELL NUMBER SALAS. AND ALASKAN TO APPROACH THE DYSON. DO YOU WANT TO GO PRESENT YOUR. OUR PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR WAS OUR TITLES HERE AS WELL OUR OUR COLLEAGUE. AND YOU'RE WELCOME TO. JOIN US AS WELL. I THINK IT WAS SHARE MEMBERS A- WE PRESENTS ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE NINETY NINE. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT TWELVE MADE IT TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY THIS BILL WILL FIX SOME OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. OF PREVIOUS LEGISLATION NAMELY AB SIXTEEN FORTY SEVEN WHICH WAS PASSED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN OF THIS LEGISLATION PLACE AN EQUAL BURDEN ON. SMALL FAMILY OWNED REFINERIES BY REQUIRING THEM TO COMPLY WITH THE SAME RULES AS MULTINATIONAL REFINERIES. THAT AB SIXTEEN FORTY SEVEN ARRAY ORIGINALLY SET UP TO TARGET. WITHOUT I'LL GO AHEAD AND ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY. I AM THANK YOU TERRY THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. MY NAME IS JENNIFER HALEY I'M THE PRESIDENT OF CURRENT OIL REFINING COMPANY. WE ARE A SMALL FAMILY OWNED FACILITY OPERATING IN BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIA WHERE TWENTY SIX THOUSAND BARRELS PER DAY CAPACITY. AND TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE SOME OF THE LARGER REFINERS IN THE STATE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND BARRELS CAPACITY SO TEN TIMES OUR SIZE. I'M WE ARE HERE BECAUSE WE GOT CAUGHT UP IN LEGISLATION THAT WAS NEVER INTENDED TO APPLY TO US. WE WERE ASSURED BY THE BILL'S AUTHOR AT THAT KERN WAS NOT THE INTENDED TARGET OF THE LEGISLATION. AND ACTUALLY IN THE INTERIM THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT HAS ACTUALLY. INVENTED REFINERIES THAT ARE BELOW FORTY THOUSAND BARRELS PER DAY. SO THIS IS REALLY A MATTER OF EQUITY WHERE IF WE WERE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE WOULD BE EXEMPTED BUT WE ARE NOT EXEMPTED UNDER THE CURRENT. WE'LL WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR LOCAL AIR POLLUTION DISTRICT AND THEY HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL AND SUPPORTIVE AND REASONABLE. BUT THEY NEED CLARIFICATION THAT THAT WE SHOULD BE EXEMPTED UNDER THIS LEGISLATION. AND SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS WERE FINALLY LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. WE ARE ALREADY SUBJECT TO SOME OF THE STRICTEST MONITORING REQUIREMENTS IN THE STATE. WE HAVE DAILY WEEKLY AND MONTHLY MONITORING ACTIVITIES. THE POLLUTANTS THAT ARE MONITORED INCLUDE CARBON DIOXIDE VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS SOCKS. WE ACTUALLY HAVE CONTINUOUS MONITORING DEVICES ON OUR FUEL GAS SYSTEM. AND ALSO ON OUR FLARE AND THAT GOES DIRECTLY LIVE TO THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT. I AM NOT HERE TO SAY THAT I AM AGAINST MONITORING FAR FROM IT. KERN HAS BEEN AN EXAMPLE OF A REFINERY THAT HAS EMBRACED THE STATE'S CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS. AND ALSO THE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. BUT THIS TYPE OF MONITORING WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE FOR A FACILITY OF OUR SIZE. FOR US TO SPEND BETWEEN ONE AND A HALF AND THREE MILLION DOLLARS BUT THIS MONITORING IN PLACE THAT WAS NEVER SUPPOSED TO APPLY TO US TO BEGIN WITH. WHAT THAT IS DOING IS DIVERTING ARE SCARCE RESOURCES AWAY FROM PROJECTS ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP OUR COMMUNITY. ACTUALLY HELP OUR FACILITY EXPAND OUR RENEWABLE FUELS REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS. SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING RIGHT NOW INCLUDES EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS AND PUTTING IN NEW BURNER TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD REDUCE OUR PETER SHINS AFTER. THAT WERE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT TWO MEGAWATT SOLAR FACILITY. I'M I'M JUST TRYING TO GIVE SOME EXAMPLES WE ARE TRYING TO BE A GOOD CORPORATE CITIZEN AND WE'RE TRYING TO BE A GOOD MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY. AND SPENDING MONEY ON THIS AIR MONITORING THAT'S NOT INTENDED FOR US PARTICULARLY EMISSIONS PROFILE OF OUR SIZE. JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. OKAY THANK YOU OTHER FOLKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN RECESS FOR THE US ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL HERE GO ON WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION WE HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF ALL OF THE STATE'S CLIMATE. CHANGE POLICIES THEY HAVE ALSO PROVIDED NOT ONLY THE OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK ON SUCH REFINERIES BUT ALSO TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES BUILDING RENEWABLE SOLAR PLANTS AND ALSO WHEN PLANTS IN AND AROUND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AREA NEAR WITH THIS ACTUAL REFINERY IS LOCATED. WE HAVE MEMBERS FROM IBEW LOCAL FOUR TWENTY EIGHT WE HAVE PLUMBERS AND PIPEFITTERS FROM LOCAL FOR SIXTY AND CARPENTERS THAT ROUTINELY WORKING IN AROUND THESE FACILITIES PERFORMING THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT WERE MENTIONED. ACTUALLY MODERNIZE THE FACILITY. BUT NOT ACHIEVING THESE PROJECTS WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT A LOT OF THE EMISSIONS WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THE AREAS POLLUTION WORSE. AND PERHAPS TAKE AWAY THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOME OF OUR MEMBERS ACTUALLY WORK LOCALLY. HAVING THEN TO TRAVEL TO DIFFERENT AREAS BECAUSE CONSTRUCTION IS CIVIL GLANCE ALSO REGIONAL AND THAT WHILE ALSO ADD MORE POLLUTION TO THE AREA. THE AREA DOES NOT HAVE THAT MUCH ECONOMIC DIVERSITY THERE'S NOT THAT MANY JOBS IN THERE IN FACT IT'S DOUBLE THE ACTUAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THIS AREA AND KERN COUNTY. COMPARED TO THE REST THE STATE THERE AT THREE POINT EIGHT WHILE THE STATE THAT I MEAN I'M SORRY THREE POINT IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UNEMPLOYMENT. 8% IS A RATE IN KERN COUNTY ALONE. AND SO THESE ARE IMPORTANT JOBS THE JOBS ARE IN AND AROUND THESE AREAS DON'T PAY AS WELL. AS SOME OF OUR MEMBERS ARE ACTUALLY MAKING THESE ARE ITSELF. AND WE'RE ASKING FOR IS SOME TIME AND SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR THE SMALL REFINERIES TO ACTUALLY PERFORM. A DIFFERENT TYPE OF MONITORING THAT'S NOT WITH LIKE WITH THE LARGE FACILITIES ARE ARE HAVING TO DO AND WE FULLY SUPPORT LARGE FACILITIES BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN SUPPORTER OF THE OF BILLS BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. TO ADD THOSE HIGHER STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS TO THOSE FACILITIES BUT FOR THESE SMALL ONES I THINK THEY DESERVE A SECOND LOOKING FOR THE REASONS. ALREADY STATED WE HUMBLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. UNDER SOAK GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS YOU KNOW FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO. JUST MAKE IT CLEAR THE AIR QUALITY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO US AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND AS IS CLEAN WATER AND- BUT YOU KNOW THE TOP THERE'S ALSO DO YOUR JOBS IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO US GIVEN THAT WE HAVE A HIGHER DOUBLE DIGIT. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE VALLEY WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT BETTER TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE. THIS BILL DOES IT DOES NOT. REDUCE THE CURRENT LEVELS OF MONITORING IMPOSED BY THE STATE AND THE LOCAL AIRPORT. IT SIMPLY STATES THAT DUE TO A FACILITY SIZE IN AN EIGHT LEVEL OF A PRODUCTION IT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN THE SAME WAY AS A FACILITY THAT PRODUCE ECONOMICALLY MORE PRODUCT ADMISSIONS. AT THIS BILL WILL OF DELIVERY EIGHTY ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. THAT WAS APPLIED TO THE STATE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. ARE THROUGH A. B. SIXTEEN FORTY SEVEN AND YOU KNOW FOR THE REASONS THAT WERE STATED TO BAD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NIVEAU. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR. OKAY LOOKS YOU WANT TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. I'M OTHERS YOU FOLKS WANT TO RAISE OPPOSITION OR CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. KAMALA. THAT ONE WORD. GOOD AFTERNOON KEREN MEMBERS MY NAME IS KATIE VIOLENCE WELL AND I'M THE POLICY AND POLITICAL DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE WE ARE STATEWIDE COALITION OF GRASSROOTS GROUPS SEEKING TO ACHIEVE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND WE ARE HERE TODAY WITH A MORE THAN TWENTY GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS AND ADVOCACY GROUPS IN OPPOSITION TO THE SPELL. WHEN OPERATING WITH AN REGULATED LIMITS REFINERIES ALREADY POSE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH RISKS TO THE COMMUNITIES AS FAR AS A MILE AWAY. THE REFINERY IN QUESTION AND KERN COUNTY IS LITERALLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM A COMMUNITY OF OVER NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO ARE PREDOMINANTLY LATINO AND ONE THIRD CHILDREN. THE MONITORS ARE THERE TO ENSURE THAT RULES ARE FOLLOWED AND THAT COMMUNITIES ARE PROTECTED AND TO SAY THAT THOSE FAMILIES DON'T DESERVE THE SAME PROTECTION AS URBAN COMMUNITIES AS OFFENSIVE ABOUT POLICY. SPEAKING ABOUT POLICY WE BELIEVE THAT THE SOUTH COAST EXEMPTION OF SMALL PRODUCERS WAS NOT AN APPROPRIATE INTERPRETATION OF THE MERCY CHEAP BELL. TO MAKE AN ADDITIONAL POLICY STATEMENT BASS ON BASED ON NOT BAD POLICY DECISION IT'S JUST ONE ABOUT POLICY INFORMING ANOTHER. ON A QUICK PERSONAL NOTE. I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN KERN COUNTY MY FAMILY STILL LIVES THERE I TAKING HEALERS EVERY DAY AS A RESULT OF GROWING UP IN SOME OF THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE COUNTRY. THIS BILL FLIES IN THE FACE OF SIGNIFICANT HEALTH EVIDENCE OF THE IMPACT OF OIL ON THE COMMUNITIES IN THIS COUNTRY. AND THIS COUNTY. AND DECADES OF ADVOCACY THAT NEIGHBORS LIKE MINE HAVE BEEN DOING AGAINST OIL IN THIS REGION. WE THINK THAT THE MONEY THAT IS INVESTED TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE MONEY THAT THEY SPEND DEALING WITH THE IMPACTS OF THESE FACILITIES AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ENTITLED TO GOOD JOBS AND CLEAN AIR. WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU ON NOT SOLUTION NOT ON THIS ONE AND WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HI YES SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON WILL BEAR WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION. WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THIS EFFORT TO WEAKEN OR QUALITY MONITORING. IN KERN COUNTY AT THE REFINERY. KERN COUNTY IS RANKED NUMBER ONE MOST POLLUTED COUNTY IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATIONS TWENTY NINETEEN STATED THE ERROR REPORT ON PARTICLE POLLUTION. AND NUMBER FIVE FOR OZONE POLLUTION. THAT'S ACROSS THE UNITED STATES NUMBER ONE NUMBER FIVE FOR MOST POLLUTED AIR. WE KNOW THE PEOPLE LIVING THERE MAJOR SOURCES OF POLLUTION. FACE GREATER RISKS DUE TO THAT LOCAL OUR PROXIMITY. GREATER RISK OF ASTHMA ATTACKS. GREATER CANCER RISKS. GREATER IMPACT A HEART HEALTH AND PREMATURE DEATH. AIR QUALITY MONITORING ALLOWS US TO US IN OUR AIR DISTRICTS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO UNDERSTAND THE LEVEL OF RISK. THAT THEY FACE FROM LOCAL POLLUTION SOURCES. THEY HELP US TO UNDERSTAND THOSE LOOK A RISK TO CREATE COMMITTEE PROTECTIVE PLANS. AND IMPLEMENT REDUCTIONS IN TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS THAT THREATEN PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS BILL MEANS LESS INFORMATION FOR PEOPLE LIVING NEAR. OIL REFINERY IN KERN COUNTY AGAIN THE MOST POLLUTED COUNTY IN THE UNITED STATES. WE OPPOSE THIS BILL WE BELIEVE IT IS A BAD POLICY WE BELIEVE THAT I GOT AMEND PROCESS FOR SOMETHING OF THIS IMPORTANCE. IS BETTER PROCESS AND THE PRESIDENT IS ALSO BAD WE BELIEVE THIS IS BAD FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. ENERGY TO OPPOSE. THE FOLKS WHO WANT TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. HELLO ERICA MARTINEZ WITH EARTH JUSTICE UP WE ARE A NONPROFIT LAW FIRM WE DO A LOT OF WORK AT SOUTH COAST AND WE WERE REALLY SURPRISED TO SEE THAT SOUTH COAST AND IS BEING USED AS AN EXAMPLE WITH THEIR REGULATIONS WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE UNLAWFUL AND INCONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATION THAT YOU PASSED IN APPROVED. WE ALSO BELIEVE IN JOBS THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND THIS BILL DOES NOT STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE TODAY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING OTHER TYPES OF CONVERSATION SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS. ALL THOSE THREE THINGS TOGETHER THANK YOU. I DELIVERED WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WE WORK DIRECTLY WITH SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THIS BILL AND STRONGLY STRONGLY OPPOSE IT FOR THE REASONS STATED BY MY COLLEAGUES. FROM IN THE OPPOSITION THANK YOU. BILL MCGOVERN WITH COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR WE'RE OPPOSED TO ASK YOU NOT TO PUT A LOOPHOLE. IN A REFINERY MONITORING LAW. AND NOT TO SACRIFICE THE HEALTH OF THE RESIDENTS TO THE REFINERY THANK YOU. AMY GO ON BEHALF OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY AIR QUALITY COALITION IN OPPOSITION. ONE OF THE MADE ON A WITHOUT ALONG CALIFORNIANS FROM THE OPPOSITION. TURNOVERS NIKITA CRIED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL STRONGLY OPPOSED. FOUR COMMA ZERO CLUB CALIFORNIA WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. AARON RODRIGUEZ FOR THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS AND STRONG OPPOSITION. MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN STRONG OPPOSITION AND I WAS ALSO ASKED TO PASS ALONG THE OPPOSITION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND THANK YOU. BERMAN CALIFORNIA CHEN JACOBSON POST. ANOTHER ASK IS HERE REGISTRY IN OPPOSITION FOR BOTH CENTER REYES HARDING OF OUR MEN WHO ALSO WORKS IN KERN COUNTY AND ALSO REGISTRY OPPOSITION FOR THE COMMITTEES FOR BETTER ENVIRONMENT THAT ALSO REPRESENTS LA COMMUNITIES AND THE BAY AREA. RENDON TOOK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS THE A BAD PRECEDENT THE BILL SETS I'VE ALSO HEARD THAT SOUTH COASTAL MENTIONED. BY VARIOUS PEOPLE I DID WANT TO POINT OUT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN. THIS PROPOSAL AND THAT IS THAT THAT WAS. SOMETHING THAT WAS ADOPTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND WENT THROUGH A LOCAL PROCESS RATHER THAN AN EXEMPTION APPEAR AT THE STATE LEVEL SO I JUST WANTED. IN THAT THANK YOU. OKAY HOW THE ITEMS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS I CENTER HELL. THANK YOU SEE HERE IN THIS IS A TOUGH ONE OF. BECAUSE CERTAINLY YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW THE CHAIR OF THE BAY AREA DISTRIBUTOR I'M SITTING ON CARP FOR A WHILE AND KNOWING THAT THE VALLEY IN KERN COUNTY IS THE MOST POLLUTED AREA OF THE STATE. THE HEALTH RISK IS SUBSTANTIAL OF. THAT THERE WAS A GOOD. COMMENT RAISED ABOUT THE AMOUNT. I GUESS THE MONITORING THAT IS NOW GOING ON. THE REGULAR MONITORING BY THE AIR DISTRICT WHAT IS THAT AND HOW OFTEN AND WITH WITH ACTUALLY. ARE DOING IN THAT MARKET THEY COME OUT ON A REGULAR BASIS. SO THE CURRENT MONITORING AND I'M FRANKLY NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SUMMARIZE ALL THAT WE DO. BUT LIKE I SAID WE HAVE DAILY WEEKLY AND MONTHLY MONITORING ACTIVITIES WE CURRENTLY MONITOR FOR. CARBON DIOXIDE VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS SOCKS LIKE I SAID THAT WE HAVE THE CONTINUOUS MONITORING ON OR FEEL GAS SYSTEM IN OUR FLARE. I CAN ALSO PULL AND WE HAVE OUR GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MANAGER WHO ALSO WAS OUR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO ADD. SOME ADDITIONAL DETAIL AT. THE DESIRED YOU KNOW ONE YEAR. LATER. HEY THANK YOU MELINDA HEX. TO FURTHER WHAT JENNIFER WAS SAYING ABOUT OUR MONITORING REQUIREMENTSI'M SHE GAVE ME THE VARIOUS FREQUENCIES AND THAT COVERS A MULTITUDE OF OUR EQUIPMENT OVER TWO DOZEN PIECES OF EQUIPMENT THAT WE HAVE THAT IS COVERED BY THAT. AND I THINK THE FURTHER ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHAT THE ERROR DISTRICT DOES AND THEY ARE OUT ON A ROUTINE BASIS THEY HAVE STRICT REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY'RE HELD TO. BY EPA SO THEY ARE IN OUR FACILITY VERY REGULARLY. AND THEY THEMSELVES MONITOR. ALL THE SAME PIECES OF EQUIPMENT THAT WE DO THROUGH THE COURSE OF THEIR ANNUAL INSPECTION AND WHEN I SAY ANNUAL IT'S NOT ONCE A YEAR THAT THEY COME OUT WE SEE THEM. MINIMAL AT A MINIMUM ONCE A MONTH SOMETIMES QUITE MORE OFTEN THAN THAT WE MAY HAVE THEM IN THE FACILITY TWO OR THREE DAYS A WEEK AT CERTAIN TIMES. IN THE. THERE WAS A MENTION I THINK IN IN A SYSTEM OF DISCUSSING THE- HE- A REQUEST OR HAVE YOU APPLIED TO THE AIR DISTRICT FOR THIS EXEMPTION. WE HAVE BEEN WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AIR DISTRICT ON THIS AND I THINK WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO SAY THAT THE DISTRICT. UNDERSTANDS AND THEY'VE BEEN WORKING WITH US TO THE DEGREE THAT THEY CAN IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY DON'T FEEL THAT THE LEGISLATION ALREADY IN PLACE IMPOSING THESE REQUIREMENTS QUITE GIVES THEM THE LATITUDE TO DO ANYTHING FURTHER THAN WHAT THEY ARE TODAY AND THAT THIS WOULD GIVE THEM THAT ADDITIONAL CONFIRMATION THAT THEY NEED. THEY HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT THEY FELT THAT THE IF THE SOUTH COAST ACTUALLY. WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND THE AUTHORITY THAT THEY HAD BY BY OFFERING THAT EXEMPTION THERE AS WELL SO I MEAN IT'S TROUBLING THE. TO SEE AND DO HERE IS I I'M JUST LOOK AT THE NUMBERS WHICH TWENTY THOUSAND BARRELS A DAY TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND BARRELS A DAY WHICH IS. QUITE LOW. COMPARED TO SO MANY OF THE REFINERY SO THIS DATA A CHALLENGE IN AND I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE DISTRICT SO I WILL. PROBABLY TODAVíA SUPPORTING THIS BILL TO KEEP IT MOVING. AND HAVE SOME FOR THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT SO THANK YOU. THANK SAID. I'M I KNOW THE CENTER GROVE IS HERE AND I THINK AS A COURTESY WE WANT TO GIVE HER AN OPPORTUNITY TO. RECENT COMMENTS. MONEY CAN FIFTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW IT'S NOT VERY OFTEN IN MOST CASES IN THE STATE THAT WE GET TO CROSS THE ISLAND WORK TOGETHER ON ON OUR DISTRICTS AND SO IT'S I'M NOT IT'S AN HONOR FOR ME TO SIT HERE WITH SENATOR HER TATO AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS TO WORK HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE JOBS THAT ARE CREATED IN THE DISTRICT ARE PROTECTED THIS OIL REFINERY IS A VERY VERY SMALL REFINERY COMPARED TO THE LEGISLATION THAT WAS ENACTED THAT WAS TO AFFECT REFINERIES REFINERIES. AND WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITH AIR QUALITY OF BUT TO ALLOW THIS TO FIND YOU TO CONTINUE IN AND FOCUS ON ISSUES THAT ARE BETTER FOR OUR COMMUNITY THAN THAN THE SIMPLE FOR ARE NOT SIMPLE BUT THE FENCE LINE MONITORING I WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR KERN COUNTY AND I'M PROUD TO STAND WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE TO WORK WITH. HIM TO GET THIS ACCOMPLISHED AND WE I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR AYE THE. OKAY THANK YOU CENTER HI SIR DOLLY. OKAY SO. I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FIRST OFF NUMBER ONE THE. IN KERN AND FRESNO. THERE WAS A STUDY DONE SOMETIME BACK IF YOU TOOK EVERY. AND IN EVERY POLLUTER OUT OF THEIR YOU'D STILL HAVE POLLUTION THERE BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE OF HOW THE VALLEY LADIES AND SO I'VE IT'S BEEN A FRUSTRATION OF MINE. I ACTUALLY WORKED WITH THE SEVEN MEMBER SALAS ON TRYING TO. KEEP A BIOMASS PLANT OPERATING IN HIS DISTRICT WHEN I WAS IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY. AND WE HAD TO WE HAD THIS YOU KNOW GROUP COMMON TALK ABOUT. THAT PARTICULAR MATTERS AND KERN AND FRESNO WARY AND. AND YOU KNOW WE WERE WE WERE TRYING TO KEEP THAT THE FORCE FROM BURNING DOWN WHICH CAUSES A LOT OF THIS PARTICULAR MATTER SOME. MY QUESTION ACTUALLY IS TO. TWO BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE VALLEY LAYS IN THE WAY THE- THE- THE EIGHT MINUTES IS A- PET PEEVE OF MINE I DON'T WANT TO. PICK A FIGHT WITH MY FRIENDS FROM THE COAST BUT- I HAVE TO STATE THE FACTS AND THE FACTS ARE THAT THEY GET A FREE RIDE OVER THERE BECAUSE THE WIND BLOWS. ALL THEIR POLLUTION INTO THE VALLEY AND THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO BREED. BECAUSE- THEY HAVE. THEIR MANUFACTURING THERE IS. THEIR QUALITIES BAD AND IS QUITE. FRANKLY DUE TO. THE WAY THE VALLEY LAYS IN THE WAY THE WINDS BLOW. SO FOR ME IT'S A QUESTION OF YOU KNOW. IF THE IF THE NEIGHBORS THERE. IF YOU REMOVE THIS PLAN COMPLETE EIGHT THE PROBLEMS WOULD STILL BE THE SAME. AND SO WE HAVE TO STRIKE A BALANCE HERE SO WE ALLOW. THE PM MONITORS AT THE COAST BECAUSE. IT DOESN'T SINCE LAST STAGNANT AIR AND THEY THEY GET TO POLLUTE AND IT LANDS IN THEIR BACKYARDS SO FOR ME THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I TRY TO WEIGH OUT ON THESE DECISIONS OF. ARE WE ARE WE. IS THAT WE NEED. IN THE VALLEY BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY'RE AT AND OTHER PEOPLE GET A FREE RIDE SO THAT'S- ONE OF THIS IS I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE WAIT OUT IN THIS. IS LEGISLATION THE OTHER THING I WANT TO. WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU IS THAT. YOU KNOW. IN IN MAKING THOSE DETERMINATIONS. OVER AND WHAT IS IT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE A FEW THOUSAND HOW MANY BARRELS THE DIFFERENCE IS IT THAT YOU MEET UNDER THIS. REQUIREMENT WAS IT TEN THOUSAND. THE MATH HERE ANYWAY SO OUR FACILITY IS TWENTY SIX THOUSAND BARRELS PER DAY THE LARGER REFINERS THAT THIS WAS INTENDED FOR A TEN TIMES OUR SIZE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND A DAY ASH. THOSE ARE THE THOSE WILL BE THE REASONS FOR ME TO BE CONSIDERING THIS BILL. BECAUSE I THINK THAT QUITE FRANKLY. THE VALLEY HAS A REALLY BIG CHALLENGES AND I THINK PART OF MAJORITY YOUR PROBLEM IS NOT FROM THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LOCAL THEY'RE OF MAJORITY PROBLEMS FROM POLLUTION COME IN FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE. YEAH THAT REALLY THE CASE. THAT'S RIGHT IF YOU WANT YEAH THAT IS TRUE I CAN LISTEN IN. OKAY STERN I DON'T. IF I HAD TO GET THERE. JUST TO JUST TO CLARIFY HOW THE CLEAN AIR ACT WORKS IN CALIFORNIA INTERBASE AND TRANSPORT OF POLLUTANTS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE SAN JOAQUIN AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICTS PLAN SO IT'S SORT OF BACKED OUT. THOSE BAY AREA NUMBERS AND THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF POLLUTION COURTING THE NUMBERS IS MOBILE SOURCE THERE SO IN IN THE VALLEY BUT THAT IS THAT I WANTED TO TRY IT I KNOW THIS I KNOW THIS IS A CRITICAL. ISSUE FOR YOU ALL AND YOU'RE SAYING YOU WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND WHICH I MEANT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY A MILLION DOLLARS MILLION AND A HALF TO. INSTALL THE SYSTEM. YOU KNOW IT FRANKLY IT DEPENDS WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE SYSTEMS WILL LOOK LIKE RIGHT NOW WHICH OBVIOUSLY GIVE US SOME HEARTBURN BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT A MILLION A HALF MAYBE EVEN UP TO THREE MILLION DOLLARS SO. I KNOW WE'VE TALKED IN THE PAST ABOUT SOME YOUR EFFORTS ON LOW CARBON FUEL PRODUCTION AND OTHERS A PREMIUM IN THE MARKETPLACE RIGHT NOW FOR PRODUCTION THOSE LOWER LOW CARBON FUELS. SO WANNA GET SENT THROUGH A ABOUT THAT REVENUE SOURCE AND THE ABILITY OFFSET ANY THESE COST TO PROTECT THOSE NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE AND GIVE THEM SOME ASSURANCE BUT SECONDARILY ISN'T THERE ALSO A. GRANT PROGRAM THAT WERE MINISTERING IS PART OF. AND IT'S GONNA SKATE ME THE BILL NUMBER IT WAS IT WAS WHAT CAME WITH THE FENCE. IT WAS WE CAME WITH THE FENCE LINE MONITORING LEGISLATION WE DID WHERE WE'VE BEEN GIVING OUT GRANTS SIX SEVENTEEN. I WILL BE SO YOU GUYS APPLIED OR HAS THE AS THE DISTRICT APPLIED FOR ANY OF THOSE GRANTS FOR. FOR FANS Là MONITOR. SO FIRST YOUR FIRST QUESTION YEAH SO KERN ACTUALLY WAS THE SECOND REFINERY IN THE COUNTRY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINE TO GET IT EPA FUEL REGISTRATION FOR OUR RENEWABLE DIESEL. THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE INCREDIBLY PROUD OF. WE ALSO GLENN BIODIESEL SINCE TWENTY TWELVE INVENTING BIODIESEL IN OUR DIESEL AND WE ALSO HAVE AB TWENTY A 20% BIODIESEL. PRODUCT THAT WE INTRODUCED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH IS NOW ACTUALLY IT COMES TO YOU KNOW THE PROFITABILITY ASSOCIATE WITH THOSE RENEWABLE FUELS. US SUFFICE TO SAY HEY THE RENEWABLE DIESEL WAS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT. THE FEEDSTOCK THAT WE'RE USING IS VERY DIFFICULT ON THE METALLURGY WE GO THROUGH KATALYST MUCH QUICKER. IT'S AN INCREDIBLY CAPITAL INTENSIVE AND IT WAS A TO A TYPE OF BUSINESS THAT. WE MIGHT FRANKLY STILL BE LOSING MONEY ON BUT CERTAINLY IN THE EARLY YEARS WELL WE TRY TO WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS WE WERE OUR OWN PILOT PROGRAM FOR THAT. BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING MORE KERN FELT STRONGLY THAT THE FUTURE IS RENEWABLES AND SO WE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS NOT TO BE OUT IN THE MARKET. BUYING COMPLIANCE INSTRUMENTS INSTEAD REALLY TO EMBRACE WHERE THE STATE IS GOING AND TO DO THE RENEWABLE FUELS. SO THAT THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO US. AND FRANKLY AS FAR AS THE PROFITABILITY. IT DEPENDS ON THE COMPLIANCE AND THROUGH MY MARKETS AND THOSE MOVE AROUND A LOT AND WE ALSO HAVE OVERLAPPING OBLIGATIONS ON THE FEDERAL SIDE. AND THE STATE SIDE THURSDAY WE HAVE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD IN CAP AND TRADE ON THE FEDERAL SIDE WE HAVE THE RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD. UNFORTUNATELY THOSE PROGRAMS DO NOT LINE UP. SO FUELS THAT WOULD ACTUALLY HELP US UNDER THE RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD DON'T NECESSARILY HELP US AND THE CALIFORNIA STANDARD. WE HAVE TO KIND OF THREAD THE NEEDLE SO WHAT PERCENTAGE OF FUEL PRODUCTION IS LOW CARBON. FUEL RIGHT NOW VERSUS STRAIGHT. PATROLLING. I THINK IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DEFINE IT BUT OUR- BEST VIEW OF THE FIRST COMPLAINT. SO ALL OF OUR FUEL IS OF THE OFFICE CLIENT BUT THAT YOU'RE GETTING CREDIT FOR FROM THE US IF THIS PROGRAM SO RIGHT NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE A RESTRICTION WHEN IT COMES TO LABELING. AND SO FOR OUR FINISH DIESEL THAT GOES OUT THE GATE UP 25% CONTAINS RENEWABLE DIESEL THAT WE PRODUCE ON SITE LIKE I SAID WE'RE THE ONLY ONES IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE PRETTY THING THAT. AND UP 25% OF THE DIESEL ALSO INCLUDES BIODIESEL SOMETIMES THE KNOWLEDGE AS A LITTLE BIT TO HIDING VEGETABLES AND FOOD WERE YOUR CHILDREN DON'T KNOW THE VEGETABLES ARE IN THERE. IT'S VERY SIMILAR WITH THE FEELS RIGHT THE FEELS ARE IN THERE BUT IT GOES OUT THE GATE AS DIESEL AND IT'S ALSO SOLD AS DIESEL. TO GO ABOVE THE 5% YOU WOULD HAVE TO ACTUALLY HAVE A SEPARATE LABEL FOR THE PUMPS WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FROM A MARKET ACCEPTANCE. THE WAY WE HAVE GOTTEN AROUND BAD OR HER DOING THAT IS THE B. TWENTY PRODUCT WHERE WE ACTUALLY NOW SELL A SEPARATE PRODUCT THE HAS THE TWENTY PERCENT. BIODIESEL SO THOSE ARE THE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE THE RENEWABLE FUELS WE ALSO BRING ENOUGH AND ALL IN ONE UP 210% ETHANOL. PERCENTAGE ARE YOU DOING AT THE TWENTY. I'M 10% OF OUR GASOLINE SALES WITH ELDER THREE NINE THOUSAND AND TEN THOUSAND BARRELS A DAY AND SO. 10% AFTERNOON IF YOU TOOK MORE OF THAT FORCED BY A MESS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OR OTHER SORTS OF FEEDSTOCKS AND BEFORE ADD BY MASS OUT OF THE VALLEY RIGHT. LOCALLY AND THEN START TO CONVERT THAT INTO RENAULT WILL DIESEL AND- GENERATED MORE REVENUE SAY YOU DOUBLE THE AMOUNT. YOU WHEN YOU'RE FAR OFFSET WHATEVER THE MILLION DOLLARS IS OUR MILLION FIVE THAT YOU NEED FOR THIS FENCE LINE MONITORING. SO I'M NOT SURE I ENTIRELY UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION. I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO OUR RENEWABLE FUELS. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAPITAL INTENSIVE AND IT'S HARD ON OUR BUSINESS THAT WE'VE INVESTED IN IT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WE ARE MONEY WOULD YOU MAKE IF YOU IF YOU DOUBLE YOUR- PRODUCTION I THINK THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS WE'RE LOOKING TO INVEST IN ADDITIONAL RENEWABLE FUEL OPPORTUNITIES. BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPITAL AND SO FOR US TO SPEND YOU KNOW A MILLION AND A HALF TO THREE MILLION DOLLARS ON OFFENSE BY MONITORING WHERE WE ALREADY HAVE THE MONITORING REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE. RIGHT I GET THAT I GET YOUR MAIN ARGUMENT I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU I GET THAT I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH MORE YOU'D MAKE IF YOU DOUBLE YOUR- BIODIESEL. PRODUCTION TO BE HONEST I THINK WE WOULD LOSE MONEY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS BEFORE WE WOULD ACTUALLY CATCH UP TO THE INVESTMENT THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE. AND THEN HAVE YOU APPLIED FOR THOSE SIX SEVENTEEN GRANT. WE HAVE NOT WHY. I DID NOT EVEN KNOW THEY EXISTED UNTIL WE TALKED ABOUT THEM IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT IT'S SOMETHING I'LL BE LOOKING INTO. SEEMS LIKE A GOOD OPTION. AND ACTUALLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WE'VE BEEN AGGRESSIVELY MEETING WITH THE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND TALKING ABOUT OUR DESIRE TO EXPAND OUR RENEWABLE FUELS. AND LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES WITH AIR RESOURCE BOARD AND ALSO WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. OF WHERE WE CAN GET HELP. YOU KNOW NOT TO CLIMB BACK UP ON MY SOAPBOX SO TO SPEAK BUT- 80% OF SMALL REFINERS IN THE COUNTRY HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. IT IS AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT MARKET. WE ARE DOING THE BEST THAT WE CAN TO BE A GOOD CORPORATE CITIZEN AND TO EMBRACE THE STATE'S CLIMATE. AND RENEWABLE FUEL GOALS BUT IF WE'RE REGULATED AT THE SAME CAPACITY AS A MULTINATIONAL YOU KNOW BILLION DOLLAR PLUS MARKET CAP CORPORATION WITH FACILITIES TEN TIMES OUR SIZE. WE CANNOT SURVIVE. AND SO THIS REALLY IS ABOUT DOING WHAT MAKES SENSE FOR OUR FACILITY AND MAKING SURE OUR DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT IMPROVING THE COMMUNITY. GET IT I JUST YOU HAVE A I'VE MET WITH YOUR. LOBBYIST THEIR SOPHISTICATED PLAYERS GIVE SOME VERY. CAPABLE ADVOCATES HERE FOR YOU IN THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY. HUNDREDS OF OTHER PEOPLE OF FIVE OR SIX SEVENTEEN GRANTS ACROSS THE STATE. I JUST I DON'T I DON'T SEE WHY THAT AND YOU TALK TO THE ADMINISTRATION ALREADY AND NOBODY BROUGHT THIS UP AS A POTENTIAL OPTION SO I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO SIX SEVENTEEN GRANTS OBVIOUSLY SIX SEVENTEEN IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PROCESS. AND WHAT WE'RE PURSUING RIGHT NOW WOULD NOT AFFECT SIX SEVENTEEN AND SO THE REQUIREMENTS THAT COME DOWN. UNDER SIX SEVENTEEN IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD LOOK AT SEPARATELY RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE THEY'RE STILL DOING THE COMMUNITY PROCESS BUT I DO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENT OF THE GRANT MONEY AND IT'S SOMETHING LOOK INTO. AND I WILL SAY WHAT IT COMES TO FOR SOPHISTICATION THIS IS MY FIRST TIME TESTIFYING BEFORE COMMITTEE LIKE THAT'S GREAT WELL I AS MUCH AS I APPRECIATE OUR OUR HELPERS EARNESTNESS IS REAL AND I TOTALLY GET THAT WERE JUST TRYING TO FIND A CREATIVE WAY AROUND THIS AND- TO AVOID THE PRECEDENT SETTING NATURE AND STILL. TO LET YOU GUYS KEEP KEEP YOU KNOW STAY IN BUSINESS BUT DOING AWAY SAID. WE'RE NOT GOING TO. CREATE. ADD PRESIDENT IN THE STATE AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IS IT BEING LITIGATED THIS THE SOUTH COAST DECISION DO WE KNOW IS THAT ACTUALLY IN COURT RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS I KNOW IT'S NOT BEING LITIGATED RIGHT NOW AND I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO PRESIDENT WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT SOUTH COAST BECAUSE IT'S SO GERMANE. BUT WE ACTUALLY THERE ARE AS PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL FOR SMALL REFINERS BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THEIR BUSINESS. ACTUALLY BEFORE THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. WE GET THE BENEFIT OF THE LOW COMPLEXITY LOW ENERGY USEFOR FIGHTER CREDIT. AND SO THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THE FUEL WE PRODUCE HAS A LOWER CARBON INTENSITY THAN THE FUEL PRODUCED BY THE LARGER REFINERS. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR FACILITY. AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING RIGHT NOW UNFORTUNATELY KERN IS THE ONLY REFINERY IN THE STATE THAT GETS THE BENEFIT OF THAT CREDIT. BECAUSE WERE THE LAST MILE REFINERY LEFT THAT'S PRODUCING TRANSPORTATION FUEL. IF I COULD JUST RESPOND JUST A SECOND THE ULTRA LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARDS THAT ARE GONNA TAKE PLACE ON THE SOUL FOR TWENTY TWENTY. KERN IS AHEAD OF THE GAME ON THIS AND TO LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THIS TECHNOLOGY IS. IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD REALLY ASK YOU GUYS TO CONSIDER NOT DOING. AND IF I COULD SURPRISE THE BRITISH GET ALL THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE HAD IN DISCUSSING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND EVEN THE AUTHOR YOU KNOW THEY WERE AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF PERILS THERE'S PRESIDENT AND STATE LAW ABOUT HOW WE DEAL WITH SMALL REFINERS COMPARED TO THE LARGE REFINERIES. SO IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AND I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU SAW SOUTH COAST TO THE ROLE THAT THEY DID THIS BECAUSE THEY WERE NEVER THE INTENDED TARGET. OF THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION. SKINNER SO THIS MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN FULLY EXHAUSTED BUT- GIVEN AT SOUTH COAST DID SUCH A RULE THIS DOES NOT NEED A LOT THIS IS NOT NEED A STATUTE WHY DIDN'T AIR DISTRICT. IN YOUR AREA. ACT SIMILARLY AS SOUTH COAST DID. I'M YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THAT THEY HAVE ALL SAY THESE ARE MY WORDS AND NO ONE ELSE'S MAYBE THE CLOUD AND THE MIGHT OF THE SOUTH COAST. OBVIOUSLY SOUTH COAST TENDS TO BE A LEADER AND ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF KIND OF THE REGULATIONS AND REALLY THOUGHT FOR STANDARD IN THE STATE. I THINK OUR LOCAL DISTRICT REALLY WANTS TO BE REASONABLE BUT THE POSITION AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS THEY DON'T THINK THAT THE CURRENT REGULATION IS CLEAR. THAT THERE IS YOU KNOW A 100% THAT A THIRTY FOR THEM TO TAKE THAT POSITION AND FOR THE DIRECTION THAT WE GOT YES. STUDENTS OUT BECAUSE IT'S NOT BEING LITIGATED I WAS GONNA SAY IF YOU WANT ME TO TESTIFY AND ALL THE TIMES THAT REGULAR YEAH YEAH YEAH YOU DON'T AGREE WE'RE GONNA HAVE VERY LONG. YEAH YEAH YEAH. THAT'S TRUE. YEAH AND SO WE'RE WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY WERE TRYING TO. WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE OUR CASE AND BE TREATED THE WAY WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TREATED FRANKLY FROM THE BEGINNING AND UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT. FUND STAFF REPORT ON PAGE TWO TALKS ABOUT GIVING THE AUTHORITY TO THE DISTRICT AND HAVING THEM GIVING. GIVING CURRENT OIL OR FROM EVER MAY BE THE- THAT THAT PROVIDER THAT GUIDES I MEAN IF THE MAYOR CG BILL SPELLS OUT. THAT THIS WAS TO APPLY TO EVERYBODY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS IN THE TORRANCE. DEAL IN IN A CAVE THE APPROPRIATE DISTRICTS. THE AUTHORITY TO GIVE GUIDANCE TO FOLKS. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU SHOULD RECEIVE NO GUIDANCE FROM SAN JOAQUIN. VALLEY NOT NOTHING ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE. THEIR SILENCE SO THEY ARE PRESUMED THAT YOU MUST HAVE. ONE MONITORING ON THE FENCE LINE AND EVERYTHING ELSE RIGHT I YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THEIR RULE AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO REQUIRE FRANKLY IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND SO I THINK THE POSSIBILITY OF THEM HAVING A RULE IN PLACE AND GOING TO THE PUBLIC PROCESS. BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR IS UNLIKELY AT THIS POINT AND NOT BUT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY IN A DIFFICULT POSITION LIKE I SAID I AM VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE. BUT THIS DOES SEEM SOMETHING APPROPRIATE GIVEN THAT IT CAME FROM THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE THE CLARIFICATION OF WHAT THIS BILL REALLY WAS INTENDED TO ADDRESS. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. WE'RE NOT PUTTING THE PRESSURE ON THE LOCAL DISTRICT BUT TYPICALLY IN THIS SITUATION. TYPICALLY IN THIS SITUATION IF THE LOCAL. APPROPRIATE AGENCY HAS NOT DEVELOPED RULES THAT THEY NEED TO DO BY JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY WE ASK FOR ANOTHER YEAR WE ASK FOR ANOTHER YEAR. TO GIVE THEM THE TIME TO MAKE THOSE LOCAL DECISIONS. THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US IS NOT FOR NOT TO MATCH SOUTH COAST. IS TO GO 255% SO WHAT'S THE COMPELLING REASON OR FIFTY FIVE. THOUSAND BARRELS. OR GALLONS VERSUS FORTY SO WHAT WOULD BE. IN MY MIND IT'S HARD TO SWALLOW YES IF YOU ASK FOR MORE TIME FOR SAN JOAQUIN. VALLEY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT ISSUE TO COME UP WITH APPROPRIATE. GUIDANCE FOR SMALL REFINERS AND WILL DEAL WITH THAT AS THEY GO THROUGH THAT RULE MAKING THAT'S ONE THING BUT THIS IS ASKING FOR A- NO LOOK AT FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND. GALLONS. GALLONS BERYL'S ERROL SORRY I GET THE RIGHT PERSIST FORTY WHICH IS WE'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE ADVOCATES THEY BELIEVE IS UNWARRANTED SO I THINK AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION TO MAKE IS THIS IS ACTUALLY A MUCH MORE RESTRICTIVE. EXEMPTION THAT THAN THAT WHAT IS CURRENTLY PROVIDED BY SOUTH COAST BECAUSE IT'S A TWO FOLD TACT THE FIFTY FIVE IS BASED ON EXISTING STATE LAWS THAT RECOGNIZE THE SMALL REFINERIES AND SO THAT IS WHY WE USE THAT CRITERIA. THAT'S WHY THAT CRITERIA WAS USED THE SECOND PIECE OF CRITERIA HAS TO DO WITH POPULATION DENSITY AND IS EXTREMELY RESTRICTIVE ADDS TO THE POPULATION DENSITY AROUND THE FACILITY WHICH IS DESIGNED TO NARROW. THE SCOPE OF THE EXEMPTION EVEN MORE BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF THE BILL WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON REFINERIES THAT ARE LOCATED IN CITIES AND DENSELY POPULATED URGENT URBAN CENTERS. TO BE CLEAR. I AM VERY CONCERNED AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING ALL OF THE PEOPLE AROUND OUR REFINERY AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT TO SAY THAT THE RULE. NATURE OF IT MEANS THAT WE DON'T NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO IT I THINK THAT THE TWO CRITERIA LIMITS THE APPLICABILITY. AND IT LOOKS REALLY AT THE SMALL REFINERIES THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTING THESE REGULATIONS AND LIKE I SAID A MONITORING SYSTEM IS NOT GOING TO PROVIDE A BENEFIT TO THE VALLEY IS NOT GOING TO PROVIDE A BENEFIT AND ACTUALLY REDUCING THE EMISSION. BUT IF WE'RE ABLE TO SPEND THAT ONE POINT FIVE TO THREE MILLION DOLLARS. TO DO ACTUAL EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS PROJECTS THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT POSITIVE EFFECT. AND SO THAT'S REALLY OUR CONTENTION IS THAT THIS. THIS IS WAS NOT INTENDED FOR A FACILITY OF OUR SIZE AND OUR MAKE UP IT'S NOT GOING TO PROVIDE A REAL BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY AND WE CAN DO OTHER THINGS WITH THOSE FUNDS. TO REALLY HAVE A DIFFERENCE IN THE VALLEY THE END SENATOR I THINK THAT'S WHY THEY WANT TO JUST COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND ACTUALLY LOOK FOR LEGISLATIVE FIX BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER INTENDED CON. AND THE INTENDED CONSEQUENCE TO GO AFTER A SMALL REFINERY. LIKE SHE SPEAKING ABOUT SO THEY SAID WELL IF WE GO BACK TO LEGISLATURE AND FIX THAT. YOU KNOW THAT BE THE PREFERRED ROUTE RATHER THAT NOW DEALING WITH OKAY SOUTH COAST IN A ROLE SAN JOAQUIN STILL CONSIDERING THE ROLE AND MAYBE THEY'LL BE LITIGATION MAYBE THEY'RE NOT BUT IF THEY WERE NEVER INTENDED CONSEQUENCE. WHICH YOU CAN VERIFY WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL IN THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL. THEN THEY WERE THINKING WELL MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A LEGISLATIVE FIX AND JUST BE DONE WITH THE ISSUE. YEAH BUT THAT MEASURE THE CHAIR I'M SORRY THROUGH CHAIR OF THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE SET FORTH ARE BASED ON STATE ASSISTANCE IN LAW RIGHT NOW. SO THE REASON WE DIDN'T GO JUST LIKE EQUAL TO OF LIKE AND JENNIFER WAS SAYING. IS YOU KNOW FIFTY. FIVE THOUSAND BARRELS IS WHAT'S- PUT IN EXISTING STAFF MY- GENERATION. HAVE KIND OF LIKE A- THIS BILL DID THIS THE SOUTH COAST DIRECTION DID THIS AND YOU HAVE THREE DIFFERENT CRITERIA SO WE JUST USE A CRITERIA THAT WAS AND THAT. WAS RIGHT EXCEPT EXCEPT I WHAT I SEE MISSING HERE ALTHOUGH IT YOUR TESTIMONY SAYING IT WHY DON'T SEE. IS THE DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR. TRANSFER IS SAYING IF WE IF WE WERE TO PUT THE FENCE LINE MONITORING IN AT OUR FACILITY. WOULD COST US A MILLION DOLLARS. IN WE'RE GOING TO PUT A MILLION DOLLARS. INTO REDUCTION OF. CO TWO OR WHATEVER NEW EQUIPMENT SO THAT THE YEAR DISTRICT COULD SAY OKAY WEEK WE CAN GO BY AND WE JOIN OUR OWN MONITORING. IT DOES IT'S WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU SOME GUIDANCE IF WE BECAUSE WE WANT TO REWARD GOOD BEHAVIOR WE'RE GONNA REWORK COULD BE DIFFERENCE OKAY IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO IN AND- CLEANUP YOUR SMALL FACILITIES MEDIUM SIZE FOR SELL THESE. BIG FACILITIES WE'LL GIVE YOU A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR YOU KNOW TRANSFER BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW MUCH THE MONSTERS GO BECAUSE THEY KNOW MUCH. THE CLEANING THAT'S NOT HERE BEFORE US THIS IS JUST TO SAY WERE SMALL WE WANT TO PROTECT YOU BUT- AGAIN YOU'RE NOT UNDER OATH AND I I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE COMPANIES. COMPANIES I COULD DO BUT THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER A LOT OF LITTLE. REFINING OUR PROCESSORS IN THIS IN THIS KERN COUNTY AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE. THAT ARE GOING TO BE BENEFITING FROM THIS THERE'S TWO. NOW AND WE ARE ACTUALLY THERE AREN'T OTHER FACILITIES IT'S VERY LIMITED NOT FIGHT THE DISTRICT ISSUE WHERE KERN IS THE ONE THAT ISN'T A BENEFICIARY OF A CURRENT EXEMPTION. AND SO THIS WOULD THIS WOULD HELP US AND GET US TO HAVE THAT PEOPLE TREATMENT. AND YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK IF THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL HAD INTENDED. FOR REFINERIES LIKE KERN HAD ATTENDED FOR SMALL FACILITIES IF THAT'S WHAT. THE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL SAID CAN WE WOULD BE HAVING A VERY DIFFERENT CONVERSATION RIGHT AND I AGREE WITH YOU SPEND THE FIX REALLY WOULD BE DOING IT THROUGH THE LOCAL DISTRICT ARE TRYING TO GET. MORE TIME OR SOME CLARITY. BUT BECAUSE THE DIRECTION THAT WE GOT WAS. WE WERE NOT THE INTENDED TARGET THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AT A FACILITY LIKE UP. THAT'S WHY. EXEMPTION SEEMS APPROPRIATE ENOUGH AND STUFF. I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE. GIVEN THE DESIRE TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY FOR ALL THE CITIZENS ARE KERN COUNTY THIS TIME GIVEN I GUESS THE LACK OF EFFORT BY THE AIR DISTRICT I GUESS I GUESS IF IT'S ONE THING FOR LEGISLATORS AND THE. THE COVERED ENTITIES BUT THIS IS WHAT THIRD THIS IS WHAT YOUR JOB IS TO PROVIDE THE GUIDANCE ITS THAT'S CLEARLY SAID AND L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G AND LANGUAGE SO&lt;/c&gt; WELL AND I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY OUR AIR POLLUTION DISTRICT HAS A LOT ON HIS PLATE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT IT'S PURSUING THERE'S A OT OF THINGS THAT IT'S DOING. AND FRANKLY WE WOULD RATHER HAVE THEM SPENDING THEIR TIME ON OTHER THINGS THAT ARE ACTUALLY GONNA HAVE A BENEFICIAL IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITY AND SO THAT'S WHERE I'M BECAUSE WE THINK THE LACK OF CLARITY IS AT THIS LEVEL THAT THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL TO. TO CLARIFY INTO THE CHAIR AND SIR THERE'S ONLY TWO I THOUGHT THERE ARE THERE'S ONLY ONE KERN IS THE ONLY ONE I THOUGHT THEY WERE TOO BUT THERE'S NOT KERN IS THE ONLY DID THE ONLY ROOF SMALL REFINER. AND THAT MEETS THIS CRITERIA AND THAT IS NOT IN A URBAN FULLY DEVELOPED IN GOAL CITY AREA. IT'S THE ONLY ONE. THAT MEETS THIS CRITERIA. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING THERE IS THERE'S NO SENSE THERE THERE ISN'T CITIES YOU'RE SAYING THE ONLY AND NOT AND THE LANGUAGES CRAFTED WRESTLING INTO CRAFTED IS VERY NARROW THIS BILL AFFECTS CURRENT OIL REFINERY. THE STATE'S IS THE STAFF IS NOT BEEN ABLE TO DEFINITIVELY VERIFY THAT CLAIM. AN ANALYSIS. I JUST I DON'T LIKE THE WAY THAT THE WEIGHT YEAH I JUST LACK OF TIME TO SIR IS WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST TO YOU. AND AT THE CENTER. SO I'M- ONE OF THE THINGS IT'S A. IS THAT A PROBLEM FOR ME IN THIS LEGISLATURE IS THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL. NEVER WORKS FOR MY LITTLE SMALL BUSINESS EITHER I GET PENALIZED. EVERYDAY IN MY NEIGHBORS WHO WERE BUSINESS GET PENALIZED EVERY DAY BY. HILL THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL I THINK THERE. IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TAKE A LOOK AT IS THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THIS WHERE WE SHOULD BE. TRYING TO. HELP THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS LEGISLATION IS GONNA. CHANGE THE AIR QUALITY THERE I WANT TO SAY THAT I. THE THAT I THINK THAT YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING BY TRYING TO FIND A NICHE MARKET TRYING TO. BE A LEADER IN IN. THE ERROR REFINING AND ADDING BIO FUELS TO IT. SO FOR THOSE REASONS I REMOVE THIS BILL. AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN HAVE THIS DISCUSSION ON THE FLOOR. NO FURTHER QUESTIONS IN A CLOSE SOURCE LIKE LAST PRIVATE. OKAY HAS BEEN MOVED BY WE WERE WE NEED A SUBSEQUENT FIRST I'VE SURGERY PLEASE CALL THE- ROLL FOR THE PERSONAL QUORUM.
