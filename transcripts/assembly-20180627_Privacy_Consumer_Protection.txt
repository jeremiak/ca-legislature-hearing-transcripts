THE FLOOR IS YOURS TO PRESENT ON AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHO IS CHAIRING THIS. THERE ARE NO HIGH PURPOSE S. ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH YEAH. THANK YOU AGAIN. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. WHO WILL BE ARRIVING SHORTLY? AB THREE SEVEN FIVE THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT AS A SIMPLE BILL. IT IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONTROL OF THEIR OWN PERSONAL DATA. AND SHOULD NOT BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST FOR EXERCISING THAT RIGHT. IF THE BUSINESS WANTS TO COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU WHILE YOU'RE SURFING THE WEB. THEN USE IT FOR REASONS OF THEIR LIKE PROVIDING A SERVICE. WAS SELLING IT THEY SHOULD ASK YOUR PERMISSION FIRST IT IS YOUR DATA. YOUR PRIVACY YOUR CHOICE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE ONLINE BUSINESSES HAVE THE ABILITY TO KNOW A GREAT DEAL. ABOUT A PERSON'S ONLINE ACTIVITIES IN FACT HEARING FIRST HAND HOW MUCH. SOME OF THESE COMPANIES KNOW ABOUT A PERSON IS WHAT PROMPTED MR ALISTAIR MCTAGGART TO BECOME A PRIVACY ADVOCATE. AND LET HIM AND OTHERS TO PURSUE A BALLOT INITIATIVE IN THE HOPE OF CURBING THESE PRIVACY ABUSES BY GIVING CONSUMERS MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR DATA. AND IS WHAT ULTIMATELY LED TO THE DRAFTING OF THIS BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY. MR MCTAGGART IS NOT ALONE IN THE DESIRE FOR CALIFORNIANS TO HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR INFORMATION. IN FACT A STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER IN TWENTY SIXTEEN FOUND THAT SOME 74% OF THE PEOPLE SURVEYED. SAY THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM THAT THEY BE IN CONTROL OF WHO CAN GET THE INFORMATION ABOUT THEM. THE SAME STUDY FOUND THAT 64% OF AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO MORE TO REGULATE WHAT ADVERTISES DO WITH THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION. THIS BILL AB THREE SEVEN FIVE GIVES CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS GREATER RIGHTS TO EXERCISE CONTROL OVER DE PERSONAL INFORMATION. AND PROVIDES REASONABLE CERTAINTY. THAT THERE ARE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO PROTECT AGAINST DATA MISUSED. CIVIC PLAYED GIVES CONSUMERS THE RIGHT TO REQUESTED A BUSINESS. CLOSE THE FOLLOWING FIRST THE TYPE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT STORE SELLS ABOUT THE CONSUMER. TO THE BUSINESS PURPOSES FOR COLLECTING WERE SELLING THE INFORMATION AND THREE THE CATEGORIES OR AYE IDENTITIES OF THIRD PARTIES WITH WHOM. THE INFORMATION IS SHARED SOLD OR DISCLOSED. IT ALSO GIVES CONSUMERS TO WRITE TO REQUESTED A BUSINESS DELETE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT THEM AND REQUIRES BUSINESSES TO DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS TO DO THE SAME. AB THREE SEVEN FIVE ALSO ALIGNS ITSELF WITH THE PROPOSED BALLOT INITIATIVE BY GIVING CONSUMERS TO RIGHT TO OPT OUT. OF THE SALE OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION WHILE REQUIRING AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT. SELL THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF CHILDREN UP TO THE AGE OF SIXTEEN IT ALSO ENSURES EQUAL RIGHT TO SERVICE MEANING COMPANIES CANNOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PROVIDING SERVICES. TO PEOPLE IF THEY DO NOT WANT THEIR DATA SO. THE IDEA THAT A PERSON SHOULD HAVE SOME SAY ABOUT HOW THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION. THIS CONSISTENT WITH THE RIGHT OF PRIVACY AND TRYING YOU KNOW CONSTITUTION. AND WE AS LEGISLATORS ALSO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO ENSURE PRIVACY RIGHTS FOR ONLINE CONSUMERS. THE AGREEMENT REACHED WITH THE IN MISSION A PROPONENTS TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP. IN PROVIDING CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR DATA. SO AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE -- TO TURN IT OVER TO POP MY JOINT AND CO AUTHORS SO FIRST OF ALL SENATOR HERTZBERG AND THEN FOLLOWED BY SENATOR ALL DOT FOR SOME BRIEF LA [inaudible] REMARKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. THE RIGHT TO ACCESS PERSONAL INFORMATION. THE RIGHT TO DELETE XIN OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION IS BEING COLLECTED. THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHETHER PERSONAL INFORMATION IS SOLD OR DISCLOSED. THE RIGHT TO SAY NO. SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. THE RIGHT TO EQUAL SERVICE AND PRICE. ENFORCEMENT BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ENFORCEMENT BY CONSUMERS. THAT IS THIS MEASURE IN LARGE PART. AS I MENTIONED YESTERDAY BEFORE THE SENATE [inaudible] JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. THE WORLD AND HOW WE SEE IT. AS BEEN CHANGED IN SO MANY WONDERFUL INCREDIBLE WAYS BY THE MAGIC OF THE INTERNET. BUT THE TECHNOLOGY GENIUS OF SO MANY. HAS MET SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THAT WE NOW TRY TO DEAL WITH IN THIS LEGISLATION OTHERS AROUND THE GLOBE OF SOUGHT TO DEAL WITH. BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE IDEAS THAT ARE OUT OF THE CONTRACT YOU AND LEARN THINGS ABOUT YOU ON THE ONE HAND THAT PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE. BY THE COMMERCIAL INDUSTRY PROVIDES INFORMATION ACCESS THE PEOPLE ON HEARD OF IN HUMAN HISTORY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY CREATE CHALLENGES THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT. OFTEN WHEN THOSE KINDS OF TENSIONS ARE MET IS TO MEDIATE THOSE CHALLENGES. HOW WE GOT HERE THROUGH THE INSPIRATION AND GENIUS OF THE PERSON WHO CHOSE [inaudible] TO GET ENGAGED THE FRUSTRATION THAT'S CAUSED BY SO MANY THAT BR CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT IS A PROCESS THAT ONE PERSON CAN LEVERAGE THE PROCESS. BUT THAT HAS BEEN THE HISTORY OF DEMOCRACY ALL ALONG. EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE AROUND THE GLOBE THERE HAVE BEEN A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE STOOD UP. THAT IS THE RIGHT TIME IN THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT GOT ATTENTION IN ORDER TO SOLVE A PROBLEM. SO I THINK THAT AS WE HEAR IN THIS BUILDING IN THIS BUBBLE OFTEN GET CONSUMED BY OUR OWN IMAGINATION. THERE'S A LARGER PICTURE OUT THERE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY INDUSTRY HAS THE HESITATION IS THAT THEY DO WAS OUR SPHERE OF THAT. PRECEDENT THAT WILL BE SAID HERE. CAN BE IT CAN SPREAD ACROSS OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. OTHER STATES. AND THE RIGHT I THINK IT WILL. AND I THINK THEIR THEIR RIGHT TO DO THAT SO WHAT DID WE DO. WE EXPANDED I THINK I IN A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT WAY WHAT WAS BUILT ON BY MR MCTAGGART. EQ YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT THAT TODAY BECAUSE HE MIGHT HAVE A CAMPAIGN IF THIS DOESN'T PASS SO HE'S GOT US DEFEND THE STATUS QUO. BUT I'M HOPING THAT HE CHANGED HIS TUNE. AFTER THE FACT IN TO EXPRESS HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY AS WE EVIDENCE TO SENSITIVITY TO SO MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY IS NOT A TIME I WALK DOWN THE HALL AT GERMAN HERE TALKS DOWN THE HALL [inaudible] DODD. SAY CAN YOU FIX THIS CAN YOU FIX THAT. THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE BEING ASKED TO FIX OUR SMALL TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT RELATE TO INDUSTRY IN LARGE MEASURE. WHAT I FIND SO ENCOURAGING IS AT ALL LEVELS FROM ALL THE BIGGEST COMPANIES? THEY GET THEY UNDERSTAND WITH THIS FUNDAMENTALLY AFFECTS THEIR CUSTOMER. THERE OKAY WITH IT BUT THERE'S SOME ISSUES AS TO THEIR BUSINESS MODELS OF SOME OTHER ISSUES THAT PART PROVIDES CHALLENGES QUITE FRANKLY. AND THAT'S RIGHT IF WHEN YOU TALK TO THIS GOOD DID IT DO DISTRICT COMMITTEE. IN THE OTHER HOUSE AT NEW JIVE BUT TALKING TO THEIR FORMER STAFFER WHO STEPS THIS COMMITTEE NOW. IT IS SO MUCH OF WHAT WE DO OVER THERE IS CORRECT THE LAW WE DON'T CORRECTED BECAUSE WERE WRONG WE CORRECTED BECAUSE THE WORLD CHANGES. AS I SAID YESTERDAY BRIEFLY THE NOTION OF THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY CAME IN THE GRISWOLD CASE IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE COUNCIL. THAT WHERE -- JUSTICE OR A BILL DOUGLAS CAME UP WITH THIS NOTION WAS EXTENDED BY DURAN CHAU WHO WROTE IT INTO THE CONSTITUTION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THOSE WERE BROAD CONCEPTS TRYING TO EXTEND WHAT THE CONSTITUTION MET ON THE ONE HAND. AND THE OTHER HAND AS WE HAVE THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY CREATES THE KINDS OF CHALLENGES THAT GOVERNMENT WAS INTENDED. TO DESIGN FOR SO I JUST WANNA. SPIKE THE BUMPS AND BRUISES THE TEST OF COURSE. IS MAYBE TO SOME EXTENT HOW WE GOT HERE. THOSE REQUIRE A DISCUSSION FOR A DIFFERENT DAY. THE BIGGER QUESTION IS TOMORROW. AFTER THIS LAWS IMPLEMENTED HAVE WE DONE SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT AND INNOVATION ON THE ONE HAND. AND YET MEETS THE VERY LEGITIMATE NEEDS OF THE PUBLIC WITH RESPECT TO WHAT PRIVACY MEANS ON THE OTHER. I'M TELLING YOU I THINK IT DOES. I'M TELLING YOU OVER IN ART FOR THIS PROCESS WAS THE PRODUCT IS BY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE BETTER THAN THE STATUS QUO. THAT IN MY JUDGMENT NO DISRESPECT A PRODUCT BY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE IS BETTER THAN WHAT THE INITIATIVE WAS. IT WAS INSPIRED BY OUR HONEST ATTEMPT TO TRY TO DEAL WITH A VERY DIFFICULT AREA OF THE LAW. BUT WE FELT THAT THIS PROCESS OF THE LAST THREE MONTHS HAS INFORMED THIS IN A WAY THAT IS GOOD. I WANT. TO GIVE ROCKSTAR ACCOLADES TO THE AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE. WHO SPENT MANY A MANY A NIGHTS HIS TEAM ROW SITTING NEXT YEAR AND MONDO NEVER BLINKED? MY TEAM OF MICHAEL BUT GUARDED AND AND FREDDIE WHO WASN'T THERE AT THAT. LECH COUNSEL'S OFFICE AT SIX IN THE MORNING AFTER WE FINISH DRAFTING AT ONE THIRTY AT THEM IN THE MORNING TO DO WHAT OFTEN IS THE IMPOSSIBLE. CERTAINLY TO TO WHAT MISTER DODD WHO PROVIDED THE MISSING LINK AND THE WILLINGNESS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN WITHOUT MISTER DODD THIS WOULD NOT BE HERE HERE TODAY. WELL AND ALSO IF I COULD JUST SAY TO THE PEOPLE AT THE FRONT DESKS OF BOTH HOUSES WHO COMBINATORS KIND OF LAST MINUTE THING IT'S IMPORTANT. MR HARRISON'S HERE WHO WAS JUST AN ELEGANT LAWYER OF BOTH MY LAWYER AND HAPPENS TO BE MISTER MCTAGGART SOME LAWYER. FROM THE GREAT RANCHO FARM. IN THE BOTH THE PRO TEM STAFF. AND THE SPEAKER STAFF WHO JUMPED TO A LOT OF HOOPS TO EVEN ALLOW US TO BE HERE EVERY APPEARING EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE DOING. AT ALL OF THE HOMEWORK AND ALL OF THE MECHANICS AND THEIR IMPRIMATUR ON ALL OF THIS WEEK IS AGAIN. FOUNDATIONAL TO MAKING THIS HAPPEN AND SO WITH THAT I JUST WANT TO SHARE STE CLOSE WITH. YOU KNOW THE ONE THING THAT THIS POPOV ACTION GAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE HEART BURN AND WE'RE GONNA WE'RE WORKING ON WITH THAT BUT WE THINK WE'VE LIMITED THAT LANGUAGE IS TO MCTAGGART PUT IN. A LETTER THAT I THINK EVERYBODY GOT. AND LASTLY I PROMISE JUST THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MISTER HOW THE OTHER BUS SETTLER. THAT A I WOULD EXPRESS HIS VIEWS BECAUSE HE'S WORRIED THAT HE'S A RIGHTLY TO BE WORRIED WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE SET UP A LEGAL STRUCTURE THAT PUTS GREAT BURDENS ON HIM. ON AND IT'S GONNA HAVE TO REORGANIZE HIS OFFICE AND HAVE TO GET A LOTTA -- FUNDING TO HIRE MORE LAWYERS IN THE PRIVACY EXPERTS AND PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH THE PROCESS THAT WE'VE SET UP. AND I TOLD HIM THEN AND I TELL THIS COMMITTEE THAT IT CHANGE PROPOSALS IN A BIT ASKING LEADERSHIP THE SAME THING. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW ORDER TO GIVE IT MEANING AND I WOULD PREDICT. THAT IN FUTURE YEARS BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TECHNOLOGY COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA AND A THE ROOM THE ROLE WE'VE GIVEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL WHOEVER THAT MIGHT BE IN THE FUTURE WILL BECOME BASICALLY THE CHIEF PRIVACY OFFICER. AS FOR THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT THAT THEY WILL HAVE. AND WITH THAT AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE COAUTHORS OWN THINK MISTER MCTAGGART WHO. SLEEPS I THINK LESS THAN I DO AND THAT'S A HARD THING TO DO. WITH THAT AND TURNED OVER TO THE GREAT SENATOR DODD. THANK YOU SENATOR AND I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PRESENCE OF ASSEMBLY MEMBERS IRWIN RAY AS BAKER AND OBERNOLTE WHO JOINED US FOR THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING SENATOR DODD THE FLOOR'S YOURS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I'M VERY VERY PLEASED TO JOIN WITH US SIMPLY MEMBER CHAO IN SENATOR HERTZBERG A CO AUTHOR. THIS CRITICAL PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL.

AT A TIME WHEN FEDERAL REGULATORS ARE ROLLING BACK PROTECTIONS WE ARE MOVING FORWARD HEARING CALIFORNIA. THIS KNEW BILL INCLUDES PROVISIONS FROM THE MEASURE I INTRODUCED EARLIER THIS YEAR SB ELEVEN TWENTY ONE TO GIVE CONSUMERS RECOURSE IN THE EVENT OF FUTURE BREACHES. PROVIDING A STRONG INCENTIVE FOR FIRMS [inaudible] ACT RESPONSIBLY. THE BILL WOULD ALSO EMPOWER CONSUMERS INSURING WE ARE INFORMED ABOUT HOW DATE IS BEING USED IN GIVING US CONTROL OVER THE SALE OF OUR DATA. BIG DATA IS BIG BUSINESS IT'S TIME THAT WE REGULATED APPROPRIATELY. AND HOLD BAD ACTORS ACCOUNTABLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR A ONE OR KNOWLEDGE -- WE'VE ENJOYED MY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN I BELIEVE NOW WE ARE GOING TO OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY FOR OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES -- TO COMMENT THAT PROPONENTS OF THE INITIATIVE OF THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED AND THEN THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITY I BELIEVE TO OPEN IT UP FOR A PUBLIC COMMENT AND QUESTIONS AS WELL FROM THE DAIS. MISTER MCTAGGART. TORTURES. YOU HAVE NEW MY NAME'S ALISTAIR MCTAGGART AND I'M THE CHAIRMAN OF CALIFORNIANS FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY. I AMONG THE PROPOSED THE BALLOT MEASURE WHICH QUALIFIED MONDAY. I I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE WHICH DOES IN OUR OPINION SUBSTANTIALLY AND MATERIALLY THE SAME THING AS THE ARE IT A GIVES. BIG CONSUMERS TRANSPARENCY ABOUT WHAT COLLECTED CONTROL OVER AYE WHETHER IT SOLD AND I GIVE THEM ASSURANCES THAT A BETTER SECURITY. I AND IF AB THREE THREE FIVE PASSES BY TOMORROW AND IS SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE GOVERNOR. WE WILL WITHDRAW THE INITIATIVE ARE DEADLINE TO DO SO IS TOMORROW AT FIVE I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT IT'S BEEN A ADJOURNING GETTING HERE -- IT'S BEEN INTERESTING AND I WANT TO REALLY -- SAY THAT IS WHAT MY EYES TO THE DEDICATION OF OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED THE PROCESS AND I WANT TO THANK THE THREE THE THREE GENTLEMAN HERE -- WITHOUT WHOM WE WOULDN'T BE HERE -- I THOUGHT THE PROCESS WAS DEAD MANY TIMES NAY KEPT ALIVE AND OUT SO I WANTED THANK GET SENATOR DODD -- THEATER HERTZBERG AND AND OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAO -- YOU KNOW WE WERE A ON THE PHONE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAU AND AND AND THAT HERTZBERG I THINK IT WAS ACTUALLY LATE AND ONE THIRD INNINGS BUT TO SAY. TO OUR ON SUNDAY NIGHT GETTING THIS THING DONE -- AND YOU KNOW LATIN ABSOLUTE WOULD NOT HAPPEN ABOUT THE DEDICATION THEIR STAFFS AND EDMUNDO -- QUIBUS WHO SAID TO STAFF FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAO. UNLIKE WHAT OUR CHIEF OF STAFF FOR CENTER HERTZBERG AND GROW WITHOUT YOUR CREATIVITY. AND YOUR POURING OIL THROUGH THE GEARS ARE ON FOOT AND I DON'T THINK IT'S WE GOT DONE SO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH NOT RICHARD OVER TO MY CO WITNESSES WILL START WITH THE ELITE'S MCDONALD A MISTER CHAIR SENATORS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT CALIFORNIANS PRIVACY DATA. I AM ALICIA MACDONALD AND I START NEXT WEEK AS AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT CARNEGIE MELLON BASED ARE SILICON VALLEY CAMPUS. I'M ALSO HERE AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE. WHEN I LAST APPEARED BEFORE YOU IS THE DIRECTOR OF PRIVACY AT STANFORD CENTER FOR INTERNET AND SOCIETY WEARING AN AFFILIATED AS A NON RESIDENT FELLOW? PRIOR TO STANFORD I WORK FOR MOZILLA AS A SENIOR PRIVACY RESEARCHER AND CO CHAIR THE EFFORTS TO STANDARDIZE THE DO NOT TRACK WEB BROWSER OPTION WITHIN THE WORLDWIDE WEB CONSORTIUM WHICH IS A STANDARDS BODY. THE WORK ON DO NOT TRACK HAS PARALLELS AND LESSONS FOR CURRENT LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS AS I WILL TOUCH UPON FURTHER. BUT FIRST BEING ACADEMIC LET ME SPEND A MINUTE ON HISTORY. THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION INCLUDES THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY AN ARTICLE ONE SECTION. ONE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL GUIDELINES FOR FAIR INFORMATION PRACTICE PRINCIPLES OR FIPS. DEVELOPED IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS ABOUT DATA BASES HELD ON MAINFRAMES. THESE PRINCIPLES ARE KNOWN AS NOTICE CHOICE ACCESS SECURITY AND ENFORCEMENT. AND THEY'VE BEEN ADOPTED BY THE FTC THE FCC DHS THE WHITE HOUSE IS ONLINE CONSUMER BILL OF RIGHTS. AND ACROSS MUCH OF EUROPE. YET THESE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE LAST FORTY FIVE YEARS REMAIN MOSTLY ASPIRATIONAL. THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT WILL HELP TO REALIZE THE FAIR INFORMATION PRACTICE PRINCIPLES. TECHNOLOGY MOVES QUICKLY WHILE LAW IS SLOW. POLICYMAKERS ARE PRUDENTLY RELUCTANT TO RISK INNOVATION AND FEAR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. SO THE FTC PURSUED AN INDUSTRY SELF REGULATION APPROACH. FOR INSTANCE THE FTC ENCOURAGE COMPANIES TO POST PRIVACY POLICIES. BUT IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THE FTC COMMISSION REPORT AND FOUND WELL 92% OF WEBSITES COLLECTED DATA. ONLY 14% PROVIDED NOTICE OF THE PRACTICES. MOST COMPANIES SIMPLY IGNORE THE FTC'S CALL FOR PRIVACY POLICIES. THE CALIFORNIA TOOK ACTION AND PASS THE CALIFORNIA ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT CALL OPA MAKING CALIFORNIA THE FIRST STATE TO REQUIRE PRIVACY POLICIES IN. TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND THEIR PRIVACY POLICIES BECAME THE NATIONAL NORM. UP BEYOND PRIVACY POLICIES FOR NOTICE THE FTC ENCOURAGE INDUSTRY TO BUILD TOOLS TO OBTAIN THE FULL SET OF PRINCIPLES. BUT DURING MY WORK CO CHAIRING DO NOT TRACK OVER A HUNDRED POLICYMAKERS ADVOCATES INDUSTRY LEADERS AND RESEARCHERS WITHIN THE US AND GLOBALLY. SPENT YEARS ON SEEMINGLY SMALL DETAILS. WE WORKED OUT THE FINER PORT POINTS OF HOW TO BUILD AN OPT OUT SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS FOR PRIVACY YET CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE REAL WORLD. THIS BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY ENCOMPASSES THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM DO NOT TRACK. PRIVACY IS NOT SOMETHING AN INDIVIDUAL COMPANY CAN SOLVE. WHEN I WORKED FOR MOZILLA WE WANTED TO RUN AN AD CAMPAIGN FOR THE FIREFOX WEB BROWSER? MOZILLA COULD NOT FIND ANY OTHER BROKERS OFFERING PLACEMENT WITHOUT TRACKING [inaudible] NOT. ONE THERE'S AN INTERLOCKING SET OF COMPANIES THAT TRANSFER DATA THAT IDENTIFIES SPECIFIC USERS. OTHERS IS NO BY NO MEANS AN INTRACTABLE PROBLEM. BUT IT IS ONE THAT REQUIRES COORDINATION. WORSE CURRENTLY NO COMPANY HAS THE INCENTIVE TO GO FIRST. THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY CUTS THROUGH THE TWIN PROBLEMS OF COORDINATION AND INCENTIVES IN A WAY THAT INDUSTRY SELF REGULATION STANDARDS BODIES AND SOFTWARE TOOLS SIMPLY CANNOT ADDRESS. SIR HISTORY MENTIONED NOW I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS SUPPORTING THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. WHENEVER THE TEXT OF THE RELATED PROPOSITION I WAS STRUCK BY HOW CAREFULLY CRAFTED IT WAS. AND HOW IT TAKES A REASONABLE AND FEASIBLE NEXT STEP FORWARD ON CONSUMER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. WITHIN THE PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE WE HAD A CHALLENGE WE'VE NEVER ENDORSED PROPOSITIONS. WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO MAKE UPDATES TO PROPOSITIONS AND WITH TECH MOVING SO QUICKLY THE ONE THING WE KNOW IS CHANGE ABOUNDS. IN THE END WE ENDORSED ANYWAY BECAUSE THE PROTECTIONS OFFERED HER SO RIVER DO. WE ARE EVEN MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THE BILL. IN PARTICULAR OUR ENDORSEMENT IS BASED UPON CALIFORNIA CITIZENS GAINING. THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT INFORMATION A BUSINESSES COLLECTED ABOUT THEM. THE RIGHT TO REQUEST THAT INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT THEM BE DELETED OR PROVIDED IN A WAY THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO TRANSPORT THE DATA. THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHEN THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN SOLD TO THIRD PARTIES TO KNOW WHAT CATEGORIES OF THIRD PARTIES THEIR DATA WAS SENT. TO AND TO OPT OUT OF ANY SALE OF THEIR INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES. THE RIGHT OF CALIFORNIANS TO NOT BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN SERVICE OR PRICE FOR CHOOSING TO EXERCISE THEIR PRIVACY RIGHTS. A LIMITED PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN THE EVENT OF A DATA BREACH. AND THE CREATION OF FUNDING MECHANISMS TO ENSURE OF ROBUST ATTORNEY GENERAL ENFORCEMENT OF THESE RIGHTS. THERE WERE ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSITION THAT WE PREFERRED. LONG TERM PROSPECT OF LEGISLATION. AS RESULT PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE ENDORSED THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH POLICYMAKERS AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO INSURE THAT THE LAW FULLY PROTECTS CALIFORNIANS. TO CONCLUDE THE LOBBY FREE TODAY IS BASED UPON FORTY FIVE YEARS OF PRIVACY RIGHTS WORK. IT DOES NOT SOLVE ALL PRIVACY ISSUES. IT IS HOWEVER A VERY GOOD NEXT STEP AS WE WORK TO EMPOWER CITIZENS TO PROTECT DEMOCRACY ITSELF FROM OUT OF CONTROL DATA YEARS [inaudible] THE CHAIR. SENATORS AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. MY NAME'S ASK CONSUL TONY I'M A TECHNOLOGIST. EXPERTS A SPECIALIZING IN PRIVACY SECURITY AND BEHAVE ECONOMICS. OF OVER TWENTY FIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD OF SERVICE STOP TECHNOLOGIES TO THE FTC. LATER THE CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST THE FTC OFFICER BRIEFLY EYES A SENIOR ADVISER TO THE CTO AT THE WHITE HOUSE OF STP [inaudible] HARM. THIS I I ASSISTED THE IN NUMEROUS STATE AGS ON ENFORCEMENT INCLUDING CALIFORNIA. THE PINS ARE PRESENT TODAY HOWEVER ARE WHOLLY MY OWN IN MY INDEPENDENT CAPACITY. FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. ON AYE PRIVACY AND SECURITY IN MY OPINION IS THE MOST PRESSING ISSUE OF OUR DESIRE. NEARLY FIFTEEN YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA WAS THE FIRST STATE TO LEAD IN PROTECTING CONSUMERS ONLINE BY REQUIRING WEBSITES TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT PRIVACY BUT THE PRIVACY PRACTICES WERE. WELL AS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP WHEN FORGERY SOON REALIZE THAT MOST CONSUMERS DON'T ACTUALLY WEEK PRIVACY POLICIES. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY EVEN IF THEY DID THAT LITTLE CHOICE IN WHAT THEY CAN DO. TO IF THEY DISAGREE WITH THE COMPANY'S PRACTICES DID A MARKET FAILURE. THIS MY THE MEASURES TODAY ARE SO CRITICAL. LAST FALL I HOPE MR RETARDED TIGER HAD DROPPED THE COMPANY CONSUMER PRIVACY BACK ACT THERE IS ALL INITIATIVE. AND I'M EXCITED SEE MANY OF THOSE PROVISIONS WE OUTLINED IN THAT INITIATIVE ARE INCLUDED IN AB TWO SEVEN FIVE TODAY. SPECIFICALLY THE ABILITY FOR CONSUMERS CONSUMERS TO SEE WHAT INFORMATION COMPANIES COLLECTED OR INFERRED ABOUT THEM. AND GENERALLY WHERE WAS OBTAINED AND WHOM IT WAS SHARED WITH IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT. MORE SIGNIFICANT HOWEVER IS THE ABILITY TO ALLOW CONSUMERS TO OPT OUT OF THE SALE OF THEIR DATA SOMETHING THAT CONSUMERS HAVE OFTEN ASKED FOR BUT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO. THE RIGHT TO DELETE DATA ADDITIONALLY WHEN CONSUMER NO LONGER WANTS TO USE A SERVICE WILL ALSO HELP SIGNIFICANTLY IN REDUCING HARM TO CONSUMERS AND COMPANIES EXPERIENCE DATA WHICH NO MORE INSTANCES OF YOUR DATA BEING. NOT LEAK FROM A SERVICE YOU HAVE IN USE IN A DECADE. THE BILL WOULD OPT OUT INTO THE ONE SIMPLY HELP PROTECT CONSUMERS BUT IT'S MY OPINION THAT WILL SPUR INNOVATION AND THE WAY COMPANIES MONETIZE THE SERVICES THEY NOW OFFER. INCENTIVIZE CLEAN COMES SORRY INCENTIVIZING COMPANIES WITH WHOM CHO CONSUMERS HAVE A TRUSTED RELATIONSHIP WITH. TO DEVELOP NEW MODELS FOR COMMERCE WILL ADDRESS THE CORE ISSUES PLAYING ONLINE ECOSYSTEMS IT IS FAKE NEWS AND A CAB CAN'T WAS THIS. CANNIBALIZATION OF OUR NEWS AGENCIES. WE'VE SEEN THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF THE OF THE EROSION OF USER PRIVACY AND CAN NO LONGER SIMPLY CONTENT OURSELVES WITH IMAGINING THIS DEBATE HAS A SQUABBLE BETWEEN PRIVACY ADVOCATES. AND ONLINE DATA COMPANIES. THE RULES ON WHAT PRIOR INFORMATION CAN BE COLLECTED HOW CAN BE USED AND BY WHOM. WILL HAVE ENORMOUS IMPACTS ON THE WELL BEING OF LARGE SWATHS OF SOCIETY AND INDEED THE LEGITIMACY AT HEART OF OUR DEMOCRACY. AN ONLINE DISCOURSE. AS AN AUTHOR OF THE BOWDEN INITIATIVE ADVISE ON TODAY'S BILL I'M STAUNCH IN SUPPORT OF BOTH. EACH OTHER STRATS A BENEFITS WERE BOTH PUT MARK A MAN MONUMENTAL STEP FORWARD ON LIKE SUMA PRIVACY. SOME OF THE TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE I'M TRULY EXCITED BY CALIFORNIA'S WILLINGNESS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND TOOK TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU. FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE TESTIMONY HOW WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC -- TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME SUPPORTERS OF AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE IF YOU COULD COME FORWARD. OUR STATE YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION REPRESENTED I WOULD ASK THAT THE COMMENTS UP. OF REMAIN BRIEF WE HAVE A PRETTY FULL HEARING ROOM SO NAME ORGANIZATION AND VERY BRIEF COMMENTS UP HONEST PERSONAL PROGRESS CENTER BEFORE YOU START WITH THE SPORT I I JUST WANNA ALSO. I COULDN'T READ MY OWN NOTES BECAUSE THESE ARE MY REMARKS RIGHT HERE THE SIZE OF THE BILL. BUT I I ALSO WANNA GIVE GREAT CREDIT TO COMMONSENSE IS IN THE CO SPONSOR OF THIS. ELIZABETH INCIDENTS SAMANTHA WORKED HARD AND BROUGH HE WAS THE FORMER CHIEF DOMESTIC POLICY ADVISER FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON. AS WELL AS CHIEF OF STAFF. TO VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN AND HAS BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN ALL THESE MEETINGS HIS WIFE HAD THIS ISSUE IN TERMS OF FAMILY STUFF THAT HE HAD TO GO BACK YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN YOUR OTHERWISE BEHALF COMMONSENSE I JUST WANTED. KNOWLEDGE HIS EXTRAORDINARY WORK EFFORT AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE TEAM. THANK YOU CENTER THEY WILL APPRECIATE THAT SHOT OUT. AND WHEN I HAD SUPPORTERS OKAY I'M ELIZABETH POLICE YEAH I'M VICE PRESIDENT OF COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION. COMMONSENSE YET BUT I'M NOT NATIONAL NONPROFIT DEDICATED TO SUPPORTING KIDS AND FAMILIES IN THE DIGITAL AGE HAS CLOSELY WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE OVER THE YEARS TO PROTECT KIDS PRIVACY. INCLUDING ON THE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN ERASER BUTTON LA AND THE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN STUDENT PRIVACY ACTS OF PEOPLE. KIDS PERSONAL INFORMATION ACTIVITIES AND NETWORKS ARE EXPOSED AND OFTEN FOR SALE FROM BIRTH. A RECENT NATIONAL POLL FOUND THAT NINE IN TEN PARENTS AND TEENS WANT COMPANIES TO PROVIDE GREATER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US TO ANSWER THEIR CALL. COMMONSENSE IS A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN A BILL THAT WERE SECURE PRIVACY RIGHTS FOR EVERY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY. INCLUDING SPECIAL PROTECTIONS FOR KIDS UNDER SIXTEEN AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO MAKE INFORMED CHOICES ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH THEIR OWN DATA. CONTROL THAT FOSTERS HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS WITH TECHNOLOGY AND OVERALL DIGITAL WELL BEING. STATE THE PIONEER THE TECH REVOLUTION SHOULD NOW PIONEER CONSUMER PRIVACY SAFEGUARDS IF CALIFORNIA LEADS THE WAY THE NATION WILL FOLLOW. WE URGE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE TO PASS THIS LANDMARK LEGISLATION THANK YOU IF YOU. CHAIR MEMBERS OTHERS TO MAKE THE CURRENT DAM BEHALF OF CALPERS WHO UNFORTUNATELY WAS UNABLE TO YOU I TO JOIN US AT THE HEARING TODAY BUT DID ASK. ARTISTS TO SHOW THEIR SUPPORT IF AMENDED PETITION THEY WANTED TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR EXCELLENT ANALYSIS IN ARTICULATING MOST OF THEIR CONCERNS. I THROUGH THAT ANALYSIS UP PERSONALLY I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL THE AUTHORS MISTER MAKE TIGER AND THE STAFF HOPEFULLY AFTER TOMORROW ALL OF US CAN SLEEP. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN URSINE NANCY TRAVEL C. E. O. OF CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA. AND I'M VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT OF WHAT I THINK WILL BE THAT STRONG BECAUSE CONSUMER PROTECTION PRIVACY LAW IN THE NATION -- I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO SENATOR DODD WHO EARLIER THIS YEAR TOOK ON THE IMPORTANT ISSUE OF TRADE TO PREACH. LIABILITY IN THE WAKE OF THE EQUIFAX SCANDAL AYE IN THIS BILL THERE IS A LIMITED BUT WE THINK WORKABLE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT WILL ALLOW. CONSUMERS TO RECOVER WHEN THEIR DATA IS BREACHED IT DOES PROVIDE -- SOME LIMITS SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO CURE IF A CURE IS POSSIBLE OBVIOUSLY AN EQUIFAX SITUATION NO CURE WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE. SOMETIMES A CURE MIGHT BE POSSIBLE IF DATA HAD BEEN BREACHED TO A PARTNER COMPANY BUT COULD BE RETRIEVED. SO WE THINK IT'S A VERY STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW. AND IT'S AN AMAZING ACCOMPLISHMENT AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE SENATOR HERTZBERG WHO I THINK FOR FIRST TO HAVE CONFERENCE CALLS AFTER MIDNIGHT. AND ALSO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAO WHO IS [inaudible] AFTER PRIVACY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS [inaudible] THANK [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] OTHER SUPPORTERS. PLEASE COME FORWARD. SCENE NINE A DO WE HAVE OPPONENTS IN THE ROOM OR THOSE EXPRESSING CONCERN WITH AB. THREE SEVEN FIVE AGAIN NAME AND ORGANIZATION AND BRIEF COMMENT SORRY [inaudible] QUICKLY QUICKLY. THINK WE COULD HAVE OUR PANELISTS CLEAR OUT AND THE WITH THE PRIMARY. OPPONENTS HAVE YOU COME FORWARD AND HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE YEAH RIGHT [inaudible] AT WE'VE GOT TWO CHAIRS HERE. WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU? GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MISTER CHAIR SENATORS MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS SARAH BUT I'M TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF CAL CHAMBER IN. OPPOSITION TO AB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS BY THE CHAIR AND BY SENATOR HERTZBERG TO CRAFT A COMPROMISE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD AVERT A SIGNIFICANT BALLOT FIGHT IN NOVEMBER. OVER THE PRIVACY INITIATIVE HOWEVER I'M SURE WE CAN ALL AGREE THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAS LEFT LITTLE ROOM FOR MEANINGFUL POLICY NEGOTIATION. WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT A BILL THAT STANCE IMPACTS NEARLY EVERY CALIFORNIA BUSINESS AND CONSUMER. THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS VERY BROAD AND IT'S NOT MONOLITHIC AND MANY IMPACTED PARTIES HAVE NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS. ADDITIONALLY MOST OF US ON THIS LEGISLATION FOR THE FIRST TIME I'M ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD WHEN IT CAME INTO PRINT ON THURSDAY. AND WE WERE TOLD TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT. DESPITE THAT NO AMENDMENTS WERE PUT INTO PRINT MONDAY MORNING EXPANDING LIABILITY IN WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE DATA BREACH SECTION OF THIS BILL AND THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH PRIVACY THEY'RE JUST ADDITIONAL GIVEAWAYS TO TRIAL ATTORNEYS. WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS OF THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THIS BILL BECAUSE IT EXPOSES CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES TO MASSIVE ADDITIONAL LIABILITY. AND BASED ON THESE NEW AMENDMENTS. THAT LIABILITY WILL PIE SITUATIONS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY AS DATA BREACHES UNDER CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW. A LAW THAT IS ALREADY ONE OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE IN THE COUNTRY. MOREOVER THE NEW AMENDMENTS REMOVED LANGUAGE THAT WOULD HAVE CARVED OUT SMALLER BUSINESSES FROM LIABILITY UNDER THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION ON TOP OF THAT. THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR SIGNIFICANT STATUTORY DAMAGES TO BE AWARDED WITH NO PROOF OF ANY INJURY. TIME AND AGAIN WE'VE HEARD THAT IF COMPANIES ARE GOOD ACTORS THEY WILL NOT BE IMPACTED BY THIS LAW. THAT SIMPLY NOT TRUE WITH THIS LAW MEANS THAT SOON AS THE COMPANY SUFFERS A DATA BREACH OR AGAIN WITH THIS LANGUAGE SOMETHING MORE THEY WILL BE SLAPPED WITH A LAWSUIT. AND A WORLD WHERE NO PROOF OF INJURY IS REQUIRED TO BE ON THE HOOK FOR HUGE STATUTORY DAMAGES MANY COMPANIES WILL BE LEVERAGING TO IMMEDIATE SETTLEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE STRENGTH OF THEIR DEFENSE AT TRIAL. FOR THOSE REASONS SUCH CAN'T CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAS IDENTIFIED SIMILAR LANGUAGE IN ANOTHER BILL THIS YEAR. S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY ONE AS A JOB KILLER. YET. DESPITE HER OBJECTIONS TO THE MASSIVE INCREASE RELIABILITY OF THIS BILL AND OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE LEGISLATION. THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY ISN'T AN UNTENABLE SITUATION. ALTHOUGH EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY FIVE IS DEEPLY FLAWED THE PRIVACY INITIATIVE IS MUCH WORSE. AND THE STAKES ARE ASTRONOMICAL BECAUSE IF THE INITIATIVE IS PASSED THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE VIRTUALLY UNABLE TO AMEND THE LAW ON THE FUTURE. THIS IS PROBLEMATIC BOTH BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANT FLAWS IN THE INITIATIVE AND BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE TO REJECT RETURN TO A VOTE OF THE PUBLIC IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE LAW AN AREA WHERE BUSINESSES. AND TECHNOLOGIES ARE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING. THAT WOULD NOT BE A GOOD OUTCOME FOR ANYONE. SO AT THIS LATE HOUR WE PREFER THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS TO THE INITIATIVE. THE BUSINESS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN AND REMAINS DEDICATED TO CRAFTING REASONABLE PRIVACY LEGISLATION WE STRONGLY URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO FIX THE NUMEROUS PROBLEMS PRESENTED BY THIS BILL AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THESE INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED. TO THAT LANGUAGE IN MANY PARTS OF THE BILL IS CONFUSING IT COULD BE DIFFICULT FOR BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS UNDERSTAND THAT WILL CERTAINLY LEAD TO MORE LITIGATION -- I PARTY TOUCH ON SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BUT THERE'S ONE ADDITIONAL POINT TO BE RAISED ADAM THE USE OF THE WORDS UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE LEAVES OPEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT A VIOLATION OF OTHER PARTS OF THE BILL. COULD BE BROUGHT INTO THIS PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR EXAMPLE THE CUSTOMER OPTS OUT OF THIRD PARTY DATA SHARING AND COMPANY MISTAKENLY SHARES IT WITH A THIRD PARTY. ARGUABLY THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF THE BUILT EXPLICITLY PREVENT SUCH AN INTERPRETATION. ALTHOUGH STATEMENT WAS MADE IN YESTERDAY'S HEARING -- AND THERE'S APPARENTLY A LETTER TO THAT EFFECT THERE'S NO INTENT TO APPLY THE DATA BREACH PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THE OTHER PARTS OF THE BILL -- WE I DON'T RECALL HEARING A COMMITMENT MADE ON THE RECORD -- TO RESOLVE THAT ISSUE BEFORE THE LAW -- TAKES THE FACT AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE. FINALLY I WANT TO RAISE A FEW OF THE EXAMPLES OF THE MANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THIS BILL. THAT CONSUMERS WILL NOT APPRECIATE. THIS BILL COULD JEOPARDIZE THE ABILITY OF RETAILERS PROVIDE LOYALTY AND REWARDS PROGRAMS TO CUSTOMERS. IT COULD PREVENT COMPANIES ROTH ACTUATING PRODUCT SAFETY RECALLS. IT COULD IMPACT THE THIRD PARTY SHARING OF DATA FOR FRAUD PREVENTION AND DETECTION. AND SOME OF THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BILL COULD BE READ TO FORCE COMPANIES TO REDUCE INFORMATION ABOUT ONE CONSUMER TO ANOTHER. WHICH GOES AGAINST THE PRIVACY BECAUSE OF THIS LEGISLATION. AGAIN THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE NUMEROUS PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL AND FOR THESE REASONS AND MORE WE ARE POSED AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE BUT ULTIMATELY. WE MAINTAIN A PREFERENCE FOR THIS LEGISLATION OVER THE BALLOT INITIATIVE BECAUSE IT IS FAR WORSE. THANK YOU MISTER MCKINLEY THANK YOU FINANCE KEVIN KELLY WITH INTERNET DISSOCIATION THIS BEEN A DIFFICULT PROCESS. AND WE HAVE MANY SUBSTANTIVE POLICY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL. HOWEVER WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE LEGISLATORS EFFORTS TO TAKE THIS IMPORTANT COMPLICATED DISCUSSION WAY FOR THE BALLOT BOX AND BRING IT IN WARM PART. APPROPRIATE VENUE OF THE LEGISLATURE. AS CAL CHAMBER MENTIONED DATA REGULATION POLICIES HIGHLY COMPLEX. AND IMPACTS NEARLY EVERY SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY INCLUDING THE INTERNET INDUSTRY. IF THE INITIATIVE BECAME LAW THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE VIRTUALLY UNABLE TO AMEND ITS PROVISIONS GOING FORWARD. A DANGEROUS PROSPECT GIVEN HOW NIMBLE AND RESPONSIVE THE STATE MUST BE IN ITS POLICIES TO ENSURE. WE REMAIN A GLOBAL LEADER INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE MOVING FORWARD TO ENSURE THE STATE'S TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP REMAINS A REALITY. THING WAS KELLY WE ALSO HAVE REPRESENTATIVE FROM NEWS PUBLISHERS. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JIM <u>&lt;c.green&gt; WORK FOR THE&lt;/c&gt;</u> CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION. I'M WE'VE ANALYZE THIS BILL I'M AS IT PERTAINS TO THREE FACETS OF OUR OPERATION ADVERTISING. AUDIENCE DEVELOPMENT MORE COMMONLY KNOWN AS CIRCULATION AND NEWS GATHERING. ON WHAT WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON ANY OF THOSE -- AREAS WE DO HAVE VERY SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE BILL HONOR NEWS GATHERING OPERATIONS. IN PARTICULAR I'M DEALING WITH THE OPT OUT PROVISION. AS WE READ THE DEFINITIONS IN THE BILL OF PERSONAL INFORMATION OF THE ON SALE SALE OF INFORMATION. ON BUSINESSES THAT WOULD BE -- ARE -- PART OF THE THE PROHIBITION -- WE THINK THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN A COMMUNITY. AS WELL AS TO PUBLISH THAT INFORMATION EITHER ONLINE OR IN OUR PRINT PUBLICATIONS. ARE AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE -- THE GYNECOLOGIST AT USC. WHERE THAT INFORMATION THAT WAS OBTAINED WAS MOSTLY FROM PRIVATE SOURCES IT WASN'T OBTAINED FROM PUBLIC SOURCES AND IN THE WORK THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT BUT ARE MOSTLY FROM PRIVATE SOURCES? ON THAT STORY IF THE GYNECOLOGIST GOT WIND OF THE IMMINENT PUBLICATION OF THE STORY COULD USE THE OPT OUT PROVISION IN THIS BILL TO PREVENT THE PUBLICATION OF THAT STORY. COMMUNITIES WOULD LOSE IF THAT WERE THE CASE. ANOTHER CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE REQUIREMENT TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THE CONSUMER HIM OR HERSELF -- OUR OWN DE LA SHIELD LAW ARE BECAUSE THEY COULD BE REQUIRED THAT A NEWSPAPER DISCLOSED INFORMATION THAT'S ON PUBLISHED THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE PROTECTED UNDER THAT. A PROVISION WE'VE SHARED OUR CONCERNS WITH THE AUTHORS. I'M WITH THE PROPONENT ARM OF THE BILL. AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN GET THAT ADDRESSED. THANK YOU FOR HER. THANK YOU SIR OTHER OPPONENTS OF AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE IF YOU COULD QUEUE UP -- BEHIND THE AUDIENCE MICROPHONE NAME AND ORGANIZATION EVERY COMMENT. LARA GLAD STATE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BANKING NETWORK ON THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION WE'RE OPPOSED TO THE BILL BUT WE DO VIEW IT AS BETTER ALTERNATIVE. SPECIFICALLY ON BEHALF OF THE RETAILERS I WOULD LIKE SAY BRIEFLY THAT -- AS THE TWO AUTHORS ACKNOWLEDGING THIS BILL WAS LARGELY WRITTEN A TECH COMPANIES IN MIND FOR COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR LITERALLY DECADES COMPLIANCE WITH CONSUMER REQUEST. A ON THE INFORMATION WE HAVE THEM WHERE THEY'RE BEEN LEGACY SYSTEMS MERGERS ACQUISITIONS AND YOU KNOW A COMPANY QUE CUSTOMER CONSUMER COULD HAVE BEEN A CUSTOMER FOR MANY GENERATIONS AND SO -- WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD AND IS IMPLEMENTED IT RECOGNIZES THAT -- WHILE THE MAIN FOCUS MAY HAVE BEEN TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES THERE ARE OTHERS IN EXISTENCE IS HAS A DEEP IMPACT ON AND SO WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S ONGOING COMMITMENT TO TRY AND WORK WITH US THE AUTHORS ON THOSE ISSUES [inaudible] THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MORE ABOUT IT WITH TECH NET WE ALIGN OUR COMMENTS OF THOSE AND PREVIOUSLY STATED THAT WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S ATTEMPTS ON THIS POLICY DISCUSSION AND THAT IT WOULD MOVES LEGISLATURE WHICH THE APPROPRIATE VENUE. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS KEVIN GOLD CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION ARE ALSO IN OPPOSITION.

CAROLINE MCINTYRE BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION. I'M GLAD TO BE HERE TO BE A PART OF THIS EFFORT AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE MEMBERS AND OTHERS THAT WILL BE INVOLVED. TO ADDRESS SOME REMAINING ISSUES. THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL OF A BRING IT BACK TO MY COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR THOUGHTS FROM THE DAIS MISTER OBERNOLTE -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE AUTHORS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD THIS IS A TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT TOPIC. I THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE DISCUSSION FOR US TO BE HAVING IN A STATE THAT'S THE BIRTHPLACE OF A LOT OF THE COMPANIES THAT USE THIS DATA. AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE PART OF SHAPING PRIVACY POLICY FOR THE ENTIRE NATION AND MAYBE THE WORLD FOR OTHER COMING. BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE FOR US TO BE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION AS A LEGISLATURE AND I DEEP CONCERNS WITH THE INITIATIVE MOVING FORWARD OF MR MCTAGGART IT'S NICE TO SEE NOT UNDER LESS ADVERSARIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. WE HAD A ROBUST DEBATE ABOUT THE INITIATIVE. PA THE INITIATIVES COMMITTEE AT OUR PARTY CONVENTION. A I DO HAVE A CONCERN THOUGH BECAUSE ALTHOUGH IT'S GREAT THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION AS A LEGISLATURE I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE ARE IT'S VERY ABBREVIATED JUST BECAUSE OF KIND OF THE ARTIFICIAL DEADLINES IMPOSED BY. THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE INITIATIVE SO ARE. IT'S IT'S A COMPLEX TOPIC AND I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT HOW VOLUMINOUS THE BILL ALREADY IS IT'S VERY CLEAR. THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF ATTENTION TO DETAIL TO GET THIS EXACTLY RIGHT SO WE GOT TO BLATANT IMPLEMENTATION IN HERE WHICH IS GOOD GIVES US ALL THE TIME TO WORK THROUGH. THE ISSUE BUT IF THE AUTHORS TO TALK. WHAT THE PROCESS IS GOING TO BE OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS TO IDENTIFY AND SOLVE THE INEVITABLE IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS THAT ARE GOING TO ARISE REFERRED A FEW OF THEM ALREADY? AND I IF YOU COULD TALK ABOUT. WHAT THOSE ISSUES ARE AS YOU SEE THEM WHAT THE PROCESS IS GOING TO BE TO FIX THEM OTHER COULD BE HELPFUL? I'LL BE HAPPY THERE ARM THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION LIMIT MANY BEGIN BY. ADDRESSING ONE OF THE ISSUES MAJOR ISSUES THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP AND THAT IS THE OF THE PROCESS ITSELF. FOR YA TO THE PROCESS BY WHICH WE CAME TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY. AND DOT I. M. THE PULLEY ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO ADMIT THAT ARE YOU KNOW I WISH WE HAD MORE TIME I THINK THAT IS. A THAT IS ONE A CONCERN THAT WE ARE YOU KNOW A LOT PEOPLE HAVE. ARE OVER JUST PROCESS AND I YET YOU KNOW IT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL YOU DATA WE HAVE TO ABIDE BY ESSENTIALLY TO IN TWENTY EIGHT IS THAT THE AIRLINE. SO WE REALLY DO NOT HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO TO DO THIS A VERY IMPORTANT WORK. YET I THINK GOD WHEN I BEGAN -- INVOLVING MYSELF IN IN THIS PROCESS AND I THINK IT WAS BACK IN APRIL OF TIME FRAME. ARE A EN WOULD DO TO THE WAY THAT WE APPROACH THIS WASTE THAT WE REACHED OUT TO AS MANY STAKEHOLDERS AS POSSIBLE. TO SOLICIT INPUT AND FEEDBACK FROM THEM ARE BASICALLY REQUESTING THEM TO PROVIDE US WITH ARMED YOU KNOW -- SOLUTIONS ARE AYE. WELL FOR EXAMPLE ARE THAT THEY COULD DOUBT PROVIDE TO US AND WE DID HAVE A NUMEROUS MEETINGS OVER THE YOU KNOW THE THE SPAN OF MAYBE TWO TO THREE WEEKS TO SELL. REACHED OUT TO THE ALL THE COMMUNITIES THE TECH INDUSTRY THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY ARE ARE THE CONSUMER PRIVACY FOLKS AND I KNOW I AND WE EXTENDED THE SAME. ARM IMITATION TO THEM AND BASED ON THEIR INPUT AND BASED ON THE OUR CONTENT OF THE INITIATIVE WHICH IS WHAT WE BASICALLY USED TO TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR DRAFTING THE LANGUAGE. WE ARE AS A RESULT TRAFFIC THE TO LANGUAGE AND THAT THE LANGUAGE CHAU WENT THROUGH A NUMBER OF ITERATIONS ARE AND ALSO INVOLVED A THE HOLDERS IN DRAFTING THE LANGUAGE AND THAT'S THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE. ARE CAME UP WITH COME UP WITH OVER THE SPAN OF FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SURE DON'T PLEASE DON'T INTERPRET THE QUESTION IS CRITICISM I THINK YEAH I JUST HAPPEN I WANT TO TWO MONUMENTAL JOB YET JUST IMPOSSIBLE. TO WORK THROUGH AN ISSUE THIS COMPLEX IN SO SHORT A PROCESS YEAH AND SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE PROCESS IS GOING TO BE HAVE SELECTED TO IRON OUT THE DID THE YOU KNOW THE DEFICIENCIES YEAH SO. NOW TO YOUR QUESTION AND YOU KNOW WHAT IS WHAT ARE WE CAN EXPECT A IN THE IN THE COMING MONTHS OR COMING WHATEVER CASE IT MAY BE. AND MY COMMITMENT IS TO ON THEIR LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE ISSUES AND AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. I AND I THINK YOU MENTIONED CORRECTLY THERE IS A ONE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION DELAY ARE. YOU KNOW HOW BY WHICH WE COULD USE TO I'VE BEEN UP BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION. AND OUR ALLY EN DA IF OF THESE ISSUES ON MERIT THEY ARE -- YOU KNOW -- LOOKING AT MORE CLOSELY WOULD DEFINITELY DO THAT A WE DO NOT ONE THAT'S SAFE WHO DO NOT WANT E. G. ARE GETTING CONFUSED FOR EXAMPLE I MEAN THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE -- IF THE AGE YOU CANNOT EVEN ENFORCED AND WE WILL WE WANT DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT SO THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE THAT WE WANNA. I WANNA COMMIT MYSELF TO WORKING AND OUT. AND ALL THAT MY OUR COLLEAGUES TO SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES BUT BUT I THINK. OUR YOU KNOW WE HEARD TODAY WE'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ISSUES THAT'S BEEN RAISED AND I HAVE TO LOOK AT EACH ONE OF THEM OTHER CAREFULLY AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY TO MARIETTA. IN FURTHER -- RESEARCHER FOR THEIR HA A REMEDY. IF I CAN GET A BIT TO THAT IS OKAY MISTER [inaudible] CHAIRMAN CLICK ON ACTING GET YOU KNOW LOOK AT YOU RIGHT IT'S IT'S IT'S SOMEWHAT CHALLENGING ON AND IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE COULD HAVE DONE IT SOONER WAY I'D WORKED VERY HEAVILY ON THIS PROCESS TO CREATED IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND WANTED TO GET -- HEARINGS DONE WAS HIT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS AFTER 25% KNOWS WHICH THEN WOULD HAVE. MOVE THIS FORWARD. THIS VERY HUMAN ANSWER TO THIS. FIRST OF THE GIVEN THE THOUGHT WE'RE GOING TO GET SOMETHING DONE. I JUST DON'T THINK ANYBODY THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE. AND I DON'T THINK THERE WAS REAL SERIOUSNESS OF PURPOSE BECAUSE OF THAT [inaudible] TO THE NATURE OF ADVOCATES OF WHICH I AS A LAWYER M.. EAST ARGUE FEW YOUR INTERESTS. AND SO WHAT WE SAW AS WE CONTINUALLY WERE FRUSTRATED ASKING EVERYBODY UNDER THE SUN GIVE IMPORTS WE HAD ADVOCACY. WOULDN'T GET SOLUTIONS WE CAN GET COMPROMISE. PARTLY BECAUSE IT THINK IT WAS IN THE GET DONE AND PARTLY BECAUSE OF THAT INCIDENT BURKE AT THE CLOCK. IT IMPOSED UPON US WE FELT THAT NO MORAL OBLIGATION TO INCLUDE AS MANY [inaudible] WE COULD. I THINK IT WAS SAID HERE'S THAT WOULD LOBBY GROUPS THAT PROBABLY DIDN'T EVEN THINK OF THEMSELVES AS PART OF THIS DISCUSSION BECAUSE IT WAS GENERALLY. ARM. A A COUCH IN THE FORM OF TECH. AND THERE ISN'T MUCH BROADER AFFECT WE LOOKED AT THE RETAILERS OR AS A LOT OF A A FOCUSES SMALLER BUSINESSES NOW THE TWENTY FIVE MADE ARE CUT OFF BUT STILL SOMEONE COULD BE. IN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WHATEVER NOT HAVE THE LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGICAL SOPHISTICATION SO IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE SOME HOMEWORK THERE. SO WHAT WE DID WAS IS RESPONSIBLE LEGISLATORS TRYING TO BALANCE OUT THIS CHALLENGE. ON ON THE ONE HAND ARE AND ON THE OTHER HAND TRY TO REALIZE THAT THERE WOULD BE LEGITIMATE ISSUES THERE ALWAYS ARE MENTION MY OPENING COMMENTS. CAN'T TELL YOU KNOW THE BEERS HAVE BEEN AROUND THIS PLACE HALF THE STUFF YOU DO IS CORRECT MISTAKES THAT YOU FROM BEFORE OR THIS NEW KNOWLEDGE THAT COMES FROM ADVANCEMENT OR WHATEVER NEW CIRCUMSTANCES. IN I REMEMBER WHEN MERCED THEIR GRAPPLING WITH WHAT WE DO WITH FAX MACHINES CAN WE TAKE A FACT SIGNATURE AND HOW DO YOU GET PAST THAT WHAT SIGNATURE ON A DOCUMENT. THINGS THAT TODAY WE TAKE FOR GRANTED AND YET YEARS AGO THEY WERE HUGE ISSUES ABOUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IT HOW WE AUTHENTICATE DOCUMENTS AND ALL THAT STUFF. SCOOBY ADVANCEMENT OF THING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LIFE AND LAW. YOU KNOW OUR OUT OF WOOD HOMES TALKED ABOUT THE LIFE OF THE LAW HAS BEEN LOGIC IT'S BEEN EXPERIENCING WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE TODAY. IS EXPERTS I THINK WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS THERE WASN'T THERE WAS A BIG QUESTION BY. THE LARGER COALITION OF FOLKS THAT SAY. THE LETTER AND I DID IF I NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT BEAR SOME. WOULD YOU AGREE TO A PROCESS AND THE CHAIRMAN SAID HE WOULD I'M CERTAINLY TALK TO A NUMBER OF FOLKS I TALKED TO THE AG ABOUT FUNDING AND OTHERS. AND I THINK WILL YOU KNOW IT WE HAVEN'T CONFIRMED ANYTHING WITH THE LEADERSHIP YET BUT THE IDEA WOULD BE CLEARLY THERE'S GONNA BE CLEAN UP BILLS. ITS PRIVACY CHAIRMAN. WE'LL PROBABLY DO. A B. THREE SEVENTY SIX AND AND AND THEN WILL YOU HAVE THE NORMAL LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE THE ENTIRE YEAR. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE BUT GIVEN THE URGENCY OF A KNOW YOU RESPECT THAT I JUST WANT TO PUT IN THE RECORD. THAT AND WE'LL FIGURE THAT OUT AND MR MATTEL YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK FREE FOR ANOTHER YEAR. WELL THANK YOU I'M I'M ARE. VERY GLAD THAT THERE'S A COMMITMENT TO SOLVING THOSE PROBLEMS MOVING FORWARD AND I THINK IF YOU WANT EVIDENCE OF THE CAREFUL JOB THAT YOU'VE DONE IN CRAFTING THE BILL IN THE SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. THAT YOU HAD. ALL ONE HAS TO DO IS LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LANGUAGE IN THE INITIATIVE WHICH IS JUST A COUPLE PAGES LONG. AND THE LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL WHICH IS TWENTY THIRTY PAGES LONG TO SEE YOU KNOW ALL OF THE DIFFERENT HOW A HURDLES THAT YOU'VE HAD TO OVERCOME SO. I COMMEND YOU FOR THAT ARE. ONE THING THAT I'M THE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I REALLY HOPE THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS IN THE EIGHT NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS BEFORE THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF THIS BILL THERE IS THAT WE DON'T EXPAND THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN THIS BILL TO DATA BREACHES THAT ARE UNRELATED TO THE PRIVACY CONCERNS OF THE BILL. OUR THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU HEARD THAT THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE REYES IT'S A CONCERN THAT I HAVE AS WELL SO I'M VERY HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN WORK ON THAT MOVING FORWARD BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU MISS OBERNOLTE. THIS BAKER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT HARD WORK A LOT OF SAUSAGE GETS MADE UP HER. AND WHILE SAUSAGE. IT IS GREAT THAT THE CONTENTS CAN SOMETIMES BE REALLY BAD AND ONE OF THE THINGS I HOPE WE WILL LOOK FOR IS WHAT AND SAID I'M HEARING A VERY AUTHENTIC COMMITMENT IS TO FIX SOME OF THOSE. PROVISIONS THAT ONCE THAT I AM I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE AND HOPE THAT THERE CAN BE AN AGREEMENT TO DO. INCLUDES THE REFERENCES MY COLLEAGUES MADE TO THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT CAN MAKE. WELL INTENTIONED LEGISLATION COST SO MUCH EXPONENTIALLY MORE AND HAVE REALLY BAD CONSEQUENCES -- AND SO I AYE ECHO THAT. THE OTHER HAS TO DO WITH THE M. NEWSPAPER PUBLICATION COMMENT. THAT IS A CONCERN A AS WE HAVE NEW TECHNOLOGY WE ALSO HAVE NEW OPPORTUNITIES. TO BE VICTIMS AS WELL AS TO BE PROTECTED AND THE PARTICULAR EXAMPLE THAT WAS RAISED IS NOT WHAT I HEARD BEFORE IT DOES ADAM. BECAUSE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW. A WE MAY HAVE. A A PROBLEM OF FINDING OUT HOW THOSE YOU CAN CAUSE CRIME ME NO I DON'T SEE A RECOGNIZED FACE OF SAY SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION OF POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION OR OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT MAY ALSO BE PART OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE DO WITH DATA BUT I WONDER IF YOU CAN COMMENT. ON THAT WHEN I HAVE ONE MORE AFTER THAT. ON SHARE ARE WHO WE ARE MINDFUL OF OF EVERYONE WHEN WE DRAFTED THE THE LANGUAGE INTO. A WHICH IS THE REASON WHY WE INSERTED INTO A LANGUAGE THAT -- LITTLE SECTION RECORDING FIRST AMENDMENTS HER AND IN FACT IT IS STATED IN THE SECTION SEVENTEEN NINETY ONE POINT ONE OF FIVE EIGHTY FOUR AND TELL. SU A WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT THAT SECTION WITHOUT LANGUAGE WILL ADDRESS OF THE CONCERN RAISED BY THE GENTLEMEN. ARE AND ARE SO. IF I COULD TELL. AND THERE'S ALSO ON REFERENCE TO FOR EXAMPLE. OUR DISA HAS TO DO WITH THE DELETION CONTACTS IN AND OUT THE IT PERTAINS TO EXERCISING OF FREE SPEECH HERE. WILL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RIGHT OF ANOTHER KIND CONSUMER FOR EXAMPLE TO EXERCISE HIS. OR HER OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH A TO BE PROTECTED BY A VITAL LAW SO AS YOU CAN SEE WE ARE MINDFUL WE ARE WHEN WE DRAFTED THE LANGUAGE WE WE WANTED TO COVER. MANY OF THESE ARE POTENTIAL ISSUES SO SO. ARE YOU KNOW I I YOU KNOW I GUESS SAID I DON'T KNOW OF THIS PARTICULAR A PROVISION WILL ADDRESS THAT GENTLEMAN'S CONCERN BUT BUT WE THINK IT DOES STATE THAT WILL YA WILL LOOK AT IT MORE CLOSELY TO GO AND I BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHERE. THAT'S WORTHWHILE TO AS YOUR TO YOU MAY BE ABLE TO DO WITH -- GIVEN THAT WHAT THE PROCESS HAS BEEN YOU'VE BEEN VERY OPEN WHICH IS GOOD -- TO THAT CONVERSATION I HOPE THAT PARTICULAR MINE CAN BE INCLUDED AS WELL. AND THE OTHER IS GIVEN THAT -- WE WE ARE IN THE PROCESS WERE AND WE'RE GONNA FIND WHETHER IT'S CLEAN UP OR OTHERWISE NEEDS THAT. BUT WHAT IF YOU WOULD BE GAME FOR THERE BEING AN ADDITIONAL. INFORMATIONAL HEARING PERHAPS BEFORE FULL IMPLEMENTATION TO REALLY AIR OUT PUBLICLY ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL CONCERNS EVER LOOKING OUT THE POSSIBILITY -- OF LEARNING SOME THINGS EVEN RIGHT AFTER THIS COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNED. AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE FRUITFUL GIVEN HOW THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN SO ABBREVIATED -- TO DO THAT I DIDN'T ASK YOU BEFORE THE HEARING WOULD BE HAPPY TO BUT IF IF THAT'S OF SOMETHING YOU WOULD PLEASE CONSIDER. THERE BE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY AIR OUT IN MORE DETAIL -- WITHIN A YEAR WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT EVEN THE FOR IMPLEMENTATION FULLY KICKS AND I I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY GOOD TO DO -- BRINGING MORE LIGHT TO THE PROCESS AND SEE YOU BEFORE. AND FOLKS START FACING MORE LIABILITY WHAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO AYE I HOPE WE CAN ENCOURAGE OUT I'D BE SURPRISED IF. BOTH BODIES WHEN BE WILLING TO DO IT I THINK YOU FOR IT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUGGESTION WE'LL CHECK IN WITH THE REST OF THE TEAM THANK. THANK YOU AS BAKER WE'VE BEEN JOINED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL. THANKS FOR BEING HERE SIR AND I KNOW THAT MR BERMAN HAS A QUESTION OR COMMENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- AND JUST TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF OF MY COLLEAGUES IN ONE I THINK -- THE SANDERS AND AND CHURCH OUT FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE -- ON THIS AND AND YOUR STAFF'S THIS POINT -- THINK THE SPONSOR OF THE INITIATIVE FOR BEING WILLING A WANNA HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON ON ON ON THAT AND BRING IT INTO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WHICH I THINK IS THE MUCH BETTER PROCESS. ALONE WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS IMPORTANT -- AND COMPLICATED -- POLICY I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT -- THE CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE THE STRONGEST -- PRIVACY PROTECTIONS -- IN IN THE COUNTRY UP BUT I ALSO WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU -- FOR YOUR KNOWLEDGE MEN AND AND YOU'RE KIND OF STATED WILLINGNESS THAT YOU SAID HERE TODAY TO KEEP ON WORKING ON THE DETAILS -- BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT A LOT OF FOLKS IN WORKING ON THIS FOR A LONG TIME BUT IN TERMS OF THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL IT'S IT'S BEEN IN PRINT FOR LESS THAN A WEEK -- WITH THE AMENDMENTS HAS BEEN PARTLY FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND WE'RE JUST HEARING FROM INDUSTRIES THAT. THAT THEY'RE WORRIED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE IMPACTED AND THEY'RE WORRIED THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL DOESN'T ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND WE'RE JUST BECOMING AWARE THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME -- AND SO IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP I LIKE THE IDEA FROM THE NUMBER BAKER OF MAYBE HAVING ANOTHER INFORMATIONAL HEARING BEFORE THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE -- BUT MAKING SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO HEAR FROM INDUSTRIES -- EITHER ONES THAT WE KNEW ARE GONNA BE IMPACTED ARE ONES THAT WE YET DIDN'T REALIZE WE'RE GONNA BE IMPACTED I WAS ALSO VERY -- IMPRESSED NINE DUH OR IT WAS VERY STRUCK BY THE NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION AND THE CONCERNS THAT THEY HAD -- AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I OFTENTIMES WE THINK WE'VE ANTICIPATED ALL THE UNANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCES BUT WE HAVEN'T -- AND SO NOW THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS TO DIGEST OF THE BILL THE THIRTY PAGES THAT HE SAID MR ONE OBERNOLTE -- AND AND START TO CONSIDER HOW THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT THEM LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WERE REALLY OPEN -- TO IT THE HEARING FROM THEM IN HEARING THE CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE AN IMPROVING THIS -- BEFORE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY SO I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO DO THAT -- AND AND LOOK FOR THE WORKING WITH THE CHAIR.
