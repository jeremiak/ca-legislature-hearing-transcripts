IMPLEMENTATION OF A ROBUST LIST

00:28:18.863 --> 00:28:20.732
OF ITEMS THAT RESULTED VIDEO

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:23.535
FOOTAGE TO TRANSFERRED TO LONG

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:26.337
TERM STORAGE. AND ALSO LIKE I

00:28:26.404 --> 00:28:27.472
COULD MENTION THE OFFENDER

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:29.674
POPULATION WASN'T VERY WELL

00:28:29.741 --> 00:28:31.843
EDUCATED AND FOR THE MOST PART

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.978
WE SEE THAT DATE. WHEN A FILE

00:28:34.045 --> 00:28:37.182
GRIEVANCES IS WELL WITHIN NINETY

00:28:37.248 --> 00:28:39.217

POLICIES THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED

00:28:41.086 --> 00:28:42.287
BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:28:42.353 --> 00:28:44.022
THEIR SON YOU PROPOSED PROCESS

00:28:44.089 --> 00:28:46.991
THAT WOULD ELIMINATE THE TIME

00:28:47.058 --> 00:28:49.694
LIMIT FOR STAFF COMPLAINTS FOR

00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:52.664
EXAMPLE AND FOR THE NINETY DAYS

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:53.765
. WHEN A LONGER KIND OF MAKES

00:28:53.832 --> 00:28:58.303
SENSE FOR THOSE. THE. I'M NOT

00:28:58.369 --> 00:29:01.539
CLEAR ON THAT A. B. IT IS A NEW

00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:03.541
POLICY YOU SAY THAT AGAIN YES

00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:04.542
YES THAT'S ANOTHER THING YOU

00:29:04.609 --> 00:29:05.977
POLICY OUT THERE ARE YOU

00:29:06.044 --> 00:29:08.213
PROPOSAL FOR A NEW POLICY. THAT

00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:10.482
WOULD ELIMINATE THE TIME LIMIT.

00:29:10.548 --> 00:29:14.185
FOR STAFF COMPLAINTS. OKAY WELL

00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:16.154
ANY ARE QUITE WILL SAY IS IF

00:29:16.221 --> 00:29:17.889
SOMEONE FILES A GRIEVANCE OR

00:29:17.956 --> 00:29:22.594
COMPLAINT AGAINST. AN EMPLOYEE.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.895
IF THEY DEAL WITH A NINETY DAY

00:29:23.962 --> 00:29:25.897
PERIOD WE HAVE THE FOOTAGE THAT

00:29:25.964 --> 00:29:27.465
THEY CAN REQUEST A PLACE TO BE

00:29:27.532 --> 00:29:29.501
YOU KNOW RECORDER CAN BE

00:29:29.567 --> 00:29:32.103
BOOKMARKED AND SAVED. IF IT WAS

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:33.671
THE FALLOUT FOUR VIDEO

00:29:33.738 --> 00:29:35.273
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WE WOULD STILL

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.008
THOROUGHLY LOOK INTO THE

00:29:37.075 --> 00:29:39.110
INVESTIGATION SO IF SOMEONE

00:29:39.177 --> 00:29:41.112
REPORTED A YEAR LATER FOR THE

00:29:41.179 --> 00:29:42.881
REPORTED SIX MONTHS LATER AND

00:29:42.947 --> 00:29:44.649
THE FOOTAGE WASN'T FAIR WE WOULD

00:29:44.716 --> 00:29:47.952
STILL LOOK INTO A COMPLAINT. AND

00:29:48.019 --> 00:29:50.088
I LIKE TO KIND OF MENTION THAT

00:29:50.155 --> 00:29:51.523
YOU KNOW VIDEO FOOTAGE AND

00:29:51.589 --> 00:29:55.160
RECORDINGS IN EVIDENCE IT'S ONLY

00:29:55.226 --> 00:29:57.028
ONE TOOL THAT WE USE OUR TOOL

00:29:57.095 --> 00:29:59.297
BOX TO THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE

00:29:59.364 --> 00:30:01.299
ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT

00:30:01.366 --> 00:30:03.101
OR PRISON RAPE ELIMINATION

00:30:03.168 --> 00:30:06.004
ALLEGATIONS OR ANY OTHER REASONS

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:10.575
SET. A COURSE FOR A PERSON WITH

00:30:10.642 --> 00:30:12.177
FILE- THE FIRE. THE IT'S JUST

00:30:12.243 --> 00:30:14.078
TOLD IT'S A PRETTY. TOOL IT'S A

00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:15.847
TOOL THAT THE COURTS HAVE ASKED

00:30:15.914 --> 00:30:17.148
THIS TO IMPLEMENTED MORE

00:30:17.215 --> 00:30:19.851
PRESENTS. OUT THERE AND SO I

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:21.085
THINK WHEN THE NINETY THE

00:30:21.152 --> 00:30:23.354
PROPOSAL WAS CREATED AROUND THE

00:30:23.421 --> 00:30:26.591
PREVIOUS ROLES AND MADE SENSE. I

00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:28.026
WOULD THINK NOW THAT WE THE

00:30:28.092 --> 00:30:29.594
RULES ARE CHANGING IN FOR SAP

00:30:29.661 --> 00:30:31.596
COMPLAINTS AND THEY'RE GOING TO

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:33.364
HAVE. A AND AN INDEFINITE PERIOD

00:30:33.431 --> 00:30:34.732
OF TIME I THINK IT WOULD MAKE

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:36.768
SENSE FOR US TO AT LEAST LOOK AT

00:30:36.834 --> 00:30:37.635
THE POTENTIAL FOR LONGER STORAGE

00:30:37.702 --> 00:30:39.871
AND WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN AS FAR

00:30:39.938 --> 00:30:41.673
AS PRICING AND- FAITH AND I KNOW

00:30:41.739 --> 00:30:43.474
THAT THERE'S ALSO CLOUT ISSUES

00:30:43.541 --> 00:30:45.310
OR SO FORTH BUT I DO THINK GIVEN

00:30:45.376 --> 00:30:45.977
THAN YOUR POLICY. MAYBE WE NEED

00:30:46.044 --> 00:30:47.278
TO RETHINK OF NINETY DAYS STILL

00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:51.182
ADEQUATE FOR WHERE THAT EVIDENCE

00:30:51.249 --> 00:30:53.551
. OKAY IF I MAY THIS IS

00:30:53.618 --> 00:30:55.286
BATTLING. UP DIRECTOR. OF THE

00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:56.654
SCHOOL SERVE. WHICH WANTED TO

00:30:56.721 --> 00:30:58.590
NOTE THAT. EVEN THOUGH THE

00:30:58.656 --> 00:31:00.792
POLICY IS CHANGING TO. ELIMINATE

00:31:00.858 --> 00:31:02.160
THE TIME CONSTRAINTS FOR FOLKS

00:31:02.227 --> 00:31:05.930
TO FILE- AND CLAIM. ON AVERAGE

00:31:05.997 --> 00:31:07.665
ALL OF THE MOST CLAIMS WERE

00:31:07.732 --> 00:31:10.468
FILED WITHIN THE TIME PERIOD I

00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:11.703
97% OF CLAIMS WERE FILED WITHIN

00:31:11.769 --> 00:31:13.738
THE TIME PERIODS SO WE- JUST

00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:14.772
BEAUSE WE HAVE ARE HAVING A

00:31:14.839 --> 00:31:16.341
CHANGE IN THAT PROCESS IT

00:31:16.407 --> 00:31:17.809
DOESN'T MEAN THAT. WE DON'T

00:31:17.875 --> 00:31:19.611
BELIEVE THAT THAT THEY WILL NOT.

00:31:19.677 --> 00:31:21.746
THEY WILL NOT FILE WITHIN A

00:31:21.813 --> 00:31:26.618
TIMELY MANNER AS WELL- THAT'S

00:31:26.684 --> 00:31:28.553
ALSO BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE

00:31:31.089 --> 00:31:33.191

SHORTER TIME WHEN THOUGH. I'M

00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:36.094
NOT SURE OF THE HERE IS GOING TO

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.729
CHANGE AS FAR AS REPORTING IS

00:31:37.795 --> 00:31:38.796
CONCERNED NOW THAT WE HAVE A

00:31:38.863 --> 00:31:41.766
LONGER. TIME WINDOW. FOR PEOPLE

DUE TO. THE OTHER GENTLEMAN ON

HAVE THE BEEN SITUATIONS WHERE

00:34:02.006 --> 00:34:04.275
THE FOOTAGE HAD BEEN REQUESTED

00:34:04.342 --> 00:34:08.579
PASSED THAT NINETY DAY WINDOW.

00:34:08.646 --> 00:34:10.081
I'M I AM NOT I'M ON THE

00:34:10.148 --> 00:34:11.482
TECHNICAL SIDE AND NOT ON THE

00:34:11.549 --> 00:34:12.450
OPERATIONAL SIDE TO MY

00:34:12.517 --> 00:34:15.820
KNOWLEDGE- THAT HAS NOT. BEEN

00:34:15.887 --> 00:34:18.856
THE CASE- BUT I CAN'T SPEAK TO

00:34:18.923 --> 00:34:23.661
THAT. OKAY ANYONE ELSE BESIDES

00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:25.696
MR SPEARMAN WHO CAN SPEAK.

00:34:25.763 --> 00:34:31.636
DEFINITIVELY TO THE. WE WILL

00:34:31.702 --> 00:34:33.137
WORK WITH OUR OPERATIONS FOLKS

00:34:33.204 --> 00:34:35.306
GET BACK WITH YOU BUT- A CORE

00:34:35.373 --> 00:34:36.374
PART OF YOUR QUESTION I THINK IS

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:37.875
YES AFTER NINETY DAYS OF A

00:34:37.942 --> 00:34:39.844
TRIGGERING EVENT HASN'T OCCURRED

00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:41.913
OR- OF CLAIMS BEEN FILED THE

00:34:41.979 --> 00:34:44.315
FOOTAGE IS DELETED- BUT WE WILL

00:34:44.382 --> 00:34:46.784
GO BACK AND LOOK TO SEE IF AFTER

00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:47.952
THAT NINETY DAY PERIOD THERE

00:34:48.019 --> 00:34:49.220
WERE CASES WHERE- FOOTAGE WOULD

00:34:49.287 --> 00:34:50.488
HAVE ASSISTED WITH THE

00:34:50.555 --> 00:34:51.589
INVESTIGATION I THINK THAT'S

00:34:51.656 --> 00:34:52.723
WHAT YOU'RE A CORE OF WHAT

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:53.758
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET CORRECT

00:34:53.825 --> 00:34:55.460
THAT THAT THAT IS BUT I GUESS

00:34:55.526 --> 00:34:56.527
I'M GOING TO ANSWER SOME OF

00:34:56.594 --> 00:34:57.929
THESE THE FOOTAGE DELETED OR NOT

00:34:57.995 --> 00:34:59.063
DELETED BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:01.732
WAS. FROM YOUR TERM TECHNICAL

00:35:01.799 --> 00:35:07.438
PERSON THAT THE FOOTAGE WAS-

00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:08.406
STORED SOMEWHERE ELSE. IF ENTRY

00:35:08.473 --> 00:35:12.143
. A ORACLE. A COMPLAINT WAS BY.

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:13.778
OKAY SO THERE'S NO CLAIM FILED

00:35:13.845 --> 00:35:16.314
THAN THAT BECAUSE TO LIVE OAK.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.682
WHAT GOT IT SO I THINK I THINK

00:35:17.748 --> 00:35:19.383
IT'S VERY QUICK VERY IMPORTANT

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:20.017
FOR US TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT

00:35:20.084 --> 00:35:22.353
THERE'S BEEN A CLAIM. THAT DOES

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:24.188
COME IN THE PAST AND THEN TO THE

00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:27.525
WINDOW. AGAIN IT BASED ON OUR-

00:35:27.592 --> 00:35:29.427
PREVIOUS LOOK AT THE DATA. FOR

00:35:29.494 --> 00:35:33.664
THE LAST YEAR. ONLY 3% OF.

00:35:33.731 --> 00:35:34.832
ISSUES CAME OUT WHERE IT WAS

00:35:34.899 --> 00:35:36.968
AFTER THE FACT AFTER THAT NINETY

00:35:37.034 --> 00:35:39.437
DAY STORAGE. SO WHAT HAPPENED IN

00:35:39.504 --> 00:35:42.540
THE 3% THIS IS A- I WOULD HAVE

00:35:42.607 --> 00:35:44.342
TO WORK WITH OUR LEGAL TEAM AND

00:35:44.408 --> 00:35:45.743
OPERATIONS TEAM TO GET SPECIFICS

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.479
ON THAT. WHERE THOSE CASES THAT

00:35:48.546 --> 00:35:49.881
YOU LOOKED AT ALL BEFORE THIS

00:35:49.947 --> 00:35:51.516
NEW YEAR THIS INCLUDE CASES

00:35:51.582 --> 00:35:53.317
AFTER THE NEW YEAR SAYS THIS IS

00:35:53.384 --> 00:35:55.119
A POLICY THAT WENT INTO EFFECT.

00:35:55.186 --> 00:35:58.089
WITH THE NEW YEAR. I BELIEVE IS

00:35:58.155 --> 00:36:00.024
THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL

00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:01.726
YEAR. RIGHT FOR MAKING AN

00:36:01.792 --> 00:36:03.961
ASSUMPTION ON. THE PROCESS THAT

00:36:04.028 --> 00:36:07.265
IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE HAVE

00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:07.899
AND I WILL BE INFORMED. AND SO

00:36:07.965 --> 00:36:09.667
WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF

00:36:09.734 --> 00:36:12.470
THE- IF PEOPLE ARE TAKING LONGER

00:36:12.537 --> 00:36:13.571
KNOWING THAT THEY HAVE MORE TIME

00:36:13.638 --> 00:36:14.539
ENOUGH TO ISSUE THOSE

00:36:14.605 --> 00:36:15.973
COMPLAINTS. THAT'S MY ONLY

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.675
CONCERN THAT BEHAVIOR MIGHT BE

00:36:17.742 --> 00:36:19.076
CHANGING GIVEN THE NEW POLICY

00:36:19.143 --> 00:36:20.945
UNTIL NINETY DAYS MIGHT OR MIGHT

00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:22.713
NOT BE ADEQUATE AND I DON'T KNOW

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:24.081
THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE. ADEQUATE

00:36:24.148 --> 00:36:26.083
DATA GIVEN THEN YOU'RE THEN

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:30.221
YOU'RE PROCESS WE HAVE. WHICH IS

00:36:30.288 --> 00:36:31.656
NOT NECESSARILY YOUR FAULT YOU

00:36:31.722 --> 00:36:32.857
CAN'T YOU DON'T IN A PLAN THAT

00:36:32.924 --> 00:36:34.425
HAS A VERY ENOUGH TIME OUT THERE

00:36:34.492 --> 00:36:36.961
BUT I DO THINK WE NEED TO BE

00:36:37.028 --> 00:36:37.862
MINDFUL OF THAT FOR MAKING

00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:39.363
DECISIONS. THIS IS A

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:41.566
THUNDERSTORM I'M SORRY LITTLE

00:36:41.632 --> 00:36:44.368
PLEASED HAD PLEASE PLEASE. I WAS

00:36:44.435 --> 00:36:45.536
JUST GONNA OF REITERATE

00:36:45.603 --> 00:36:47.138
SOMETHING THAT MR SPEARMAN

00:36:47.204 --> 00:36:48.639
POINTED OUT THAT IS WE HAVE BEEN

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:49.607
DOING A LOT OF OFFENDER

00:36:49.674 --> 00:36:51.342
EDUCATION ON THIS NEW PROCESS TO

00:36:51.409 --> 00:36:53.210
MAKE THEM ALL VERY AWARE OF HOW

00:36:53.277 --> 00:36:54.712
WHAT THE CHANGES ARE HOW AND HOW

00:36:54.779 --> 00:36:56.080
THEY WILL IMPACT THEM SO WE

00:36:56.147 --> 00:36:58.049
THINK THAT- OFFENDER EDUCATION

00:36:58.115 --> 00:36:59.984
PLUS RELAPSE NEW PROCESS THE

00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:03.154
NINETY DAYS THE SUFFICIENT WHAT

00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:06.891
. MEMBERS OKAY I GUESS I THINK

00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:08.526
WE ARE HERE FROM MARCH IS JUST

00:37:08.593 --> 00:37:11.862
CONCERN ON EVEN AND TODAY WHAT

00:37:11.929 --> 00:37:13.331
WE HEAR CONSTANTLY AS HUNDREDS

00:37:13.397 --> 00:37:15.466
OF MILLIONS OR BILLIONS OF

00:37:15.533 --> 00:37:16.767
DOLLARS EXPENDITURES FOR THE

00:37:16.834 --> 00:37:18.836
DEPARTMENT THAT THIS MAY BE A

00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:22.206
MEANWHILE WHILE WE REALLY AFFECT

00:37:22.273 --> 00:37:24.308
THE DEPARTMENT FOR TRYING TO BE

00:37:24.375 --> 00:37:25.710
RESOURCEFUL THIS SEEMS TO BE A

00:37:25.776 --> 00:37:27.378
SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE BEING

00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:28.946
PENNY WISE POUND FOOLISH AND

00:37:29.013 --> 00:37:31.649
THAT- THIS IS A VERY CRITICAL

00:37:31.716 --> 00:37:33.584
VIDEO FOOTAGE I MYSELF HAD A

00:37:33.651 --> 00:37:36.821
CHANCE TO. ON WITNESS IT WHEN-

00:37:36.887 --> 00:37:39.423
I'VE OF WITNESSING BODY CAMERA

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:40.891
FOOTAGE WHEN I WENT TO CORCORAN-

00:37:40.958 --> 00:37:43.060
AND THE FACT THAT I THINK IT'S

00:37:43.127 --> 00:37:43.794
THERE ON THE OFFICERS I THINK

00:37:43.861 --> 00:37:46.697
IT'S VERY- COMPELLING BECAUSE

00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:50.401
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE THAT VIDEO

00:37:50.468 --> 00:37:51.469
EVIDENCE RATHER THAN HAVING TO.

00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:53.070
HOW WHAT I WITNESSED RECOUNT

00:37:53.137 --> 00:37:53.704
DIFFERENCE WHICH- I THINK IT'S

00:37:53.771 --> 00:37:56.440
VERY CRITICAL INFORMATION TO.

00:37:56.507 --> 00:37:58.309
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE IMPROPER

00:37:58.376 --> 00:38:00.978
TRANSPARENCY AND THAT- SINCE WE

00:38:01.045 --> 00:38:04.448
HAVE THE- HE VIDEO FOOTAGE

00:38:04.515 --> 00:38:05.783
ANYWAYS I THINK IT WOULD BE A

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:08.619
SHAME TO ACTUALLY DELETE IT OR

00:38:08.686 --> 00:38:11.656
TO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO IT- FIFTY

00:38:11.722 --> 00:38:12.923
FORTY PAY FOR RECORDED AND

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:15.192
STORED IT ON YOU KNOW IF OTHER

00:38:15.259 --> 00:38:16.494
CRIMES WERE COMMITTED AND FROM

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.062
THE SPECIALLY LIKE YOU AND SAID

00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:20.631
THE 3% THE CASES THEY CAME AFTER

00:38:20.698 --> 00:38:21.599
THE VIDEO FOOTAGE HAS ALREADY

00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:24.201
BEEN- EITHER DELETED OR STORED

00:38:24.268 --> 00:38:27.038
AND I'M NOT I'M NOT REALLY CLEAR

00:38:27.104 --> 00:38:28.039
WHICH ONE. BUT IT SEEMS.

00:38:28.105 --> 00:38:29.240
IMPORTERS WE WILL BE PAID FOR

00:38:29.306 --> 00:38:30.941
THIS IT'S ALREADY A SUNK COST-

00:38:31.008 --> 00:38:33.077
THE DISCIPLINE TO BE ANY. A VERY

00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:35.413
GOOD REASON WHY THAT STORE THAT

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:38.382
VIDEO INFORMATION ISN'T STORED.

00:38:38.449 --> 00:38:39.817
YOU KNOW AT LEAST ON A BOND ON A

00:38:39.884 --> 00:38:43.487
ON A LONGER BASIS. RATHER THAN-

00:38:43.554 --> 00:38:44.655
YOU KNOW GETTING RID OF IT SINCE

00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:45.756
WE'VE ALREADY PAID FOR IT

00:38:45.823 --> 00:38:49.093
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE- ANY. ANY

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.461
SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS

00:38:50.528 --> 00:38:52.329
ESPECIALLY WHEN I LOOK AT ALL

00:38:52.396 --> 00:38:53.831
YOUR OTHER PCPS WHICH ARE. TENS

00:38:53.898 --> 00:38:55.032

GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXPAND

00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:14.078

HOWEVER BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT

00:45:21.218 --> 00:45:23.887
WE HAVE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:45:23.954 --> 00:45:25.155
THAT WOULD MODIFY THE PROPOSAL.

00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:26.523
WE ARE FIRST RECOMMENDING THAT

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:28.058
THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE

00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:29.893
DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE A REVISED

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.762

00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:33.263
THAT IS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:35.933
UPDATED PROJECTIONS. BECAUSE THE

00:45:35.999 --> 00:45:37.201
OVERALL LEVEL OF FUNDING BEING

00:45:37.267 --> 00:45:39.336
REQUESTED FOR THE PROGRAM IS

00:45:39.403 --> 00:45:41.205
CLOSELY CONNECTED AT THE SIZE OF

00:45:41.271 --> 00:45:42.773
THE INMATE POPULATION. THE

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.374
PROPOSAL WILL LIKELY NEED TO BE

00:45:44.441 --> 00:45:46.176
ADJUSTED FOR THE POSSIBILITY

00:45:46.243 --> 00:45:47.878
THAT THE INMATE POPULATION MAY

00:45:47.945 --> 00:45:49.146
BE LOWER THAN CURRENTLY

00:45:49.213 --> 00:45:51.615
PROJECTED AS DISCUSSED IN THE

00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:52.816
LAST HEARING. OUR SECOND

00:45:52.883 --> 00:45:54.985
RECOMMENDATION IS TO THE EXTENT

00:45:55.052 --> 00:45:56.687
THAT THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO

00:45:56.753 --> 00:45:58.856
APPROVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. FOR

00:45:58.922 --> 00:46:00.757
THE PROGRAM WE RECOMMEND

00:46:00.824 --> 00:46:02.559
APPROVAL OF PROVISIONAL BUDGET

00:46:02.626 --> 00:46:04.228
LANGUAGE REQUIRING THAT ANY

00:46:04.294 --> 00:46:06.130
BUDGET FUNDS NOT SPENT ON THE

00:46:06.196 --> 00:46:08.265
PROGRAM. REVERT TO THE GENERAL

00:46:08.332 --> 00:46:10.000
FUND AND WE WANT TO POINT OUT

00:46:10.067 --> 00:46:11.502
THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF

00:46:11.568 --> 00:46:12.903
FACTORS THAT COULD LIMIT THAT

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:14.805
DEPARTMENTS ABILITY TO EXPAND AS

00:46:14.872 --> 00:46:17.508
PROPOSED. THESE LIMITATIONS

00:46:17.574 --> 00:46:18.976
WOULD RESULT IN THE DEPARTMENT

00:46:19.042 --> 00:46:21.845
NOT USING THE FULL BUDGET AMOUNT

00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:22.946
. FOR EXAMPLE IT COULD TAKE

00:46:23.013 --> 00:46:24.715
LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED TO FILL

00:46:24.781 --> 00:46:26.483
THE REQUESTED THREE HUNDRED AND

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.852
TEN POSITIONS. ALSO IT IS

00:46:28.919 --> 00:46:30.254
QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THE

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.189
DEPARTMENT WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT

00:46:32.256 --> 00:46:34.358
SPACE TO ACCOMMODATE THE LEVEL

00:46:34.424 --> 00:46:36.193
NECESSARY FOR THE EXPANSION.

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.528
GIVEN THAT LAST YEAR THE

00:46:37.594 --> 00:46:39.496
DEPARTMENT NOTED SUFFICIENT

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:41.165
CLASSROOM SPACE AT THE PRISONS

00:46:41.231 --> 00:46:43.867
AS A CHALLENGE. THE LAST THING.

00:46:43.934 --> 00:46:45.068
WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE

00:46:45.135 --> 00:46:46.837

RESULTS OF THE EVALUATION THAT

00:46:49.973 --> 00:46:52.042
THEY ARE CONTRACTING WITH SO

00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:53.076
THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN

00:46:53.143 --> 00:46:55.712
DETERMINE. WHETHER THE PROGRAM

00:46:55.779 --> 00:46:56.413
IS EFFECTIVELY ACHIEVING ITS

00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:00.184
GOALS. OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:01.318
THE PROGRAM IS NOT YET CLEAR.

00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:03.654
INITIAL DATA SHOW THAT SUBSTANCE

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.656
USE DISORDER RELATED DEATHS AND

00:47:05.722 --> 00:47:08.058

ASSISTED TREATMENT PROGRAM

00:50:39.369 --> 00:50:40.804
CONSISTS OF THAT WE WOULD

00:50:40.871 --> 00:50:42.439
ACTUALLY ADJUST THOSE FROM YEAR

00:50:42.506 --> 00:50:44.207
TO YEAR BASED ON THE POPULATION

AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THOSE

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:47.043
INCREASE OR DECREASE WE WOULD

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:49.079
ANTICIPATE THAT OUR- ADJUSTMENT

00:50:49.146 --> 00:50:50.714
METHODOLOGY WOULD REFLECT THAT.

00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:53.350
WE HAVE NOT- DETERMINE WHAT THE

00:50:53.417 --> 00:50:56.620

00:50:58.422 --> 00:50:59.856
WITH THAT THE WAY THAT WE TREAT

00:50:59.923 --> 00:51:00.290
POPULATION DIFFERENT

00:51:00.357 --> 00:51:01.358
METHODOLOGIES BUT WE ANTICIPATE

00:51:01.425 --> 00:51:02.826
WE WOULD BE ABLE TO BRING

00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:04.928
INFORMATION FORWARD IN THE NEXT

00:51:04.995 --> 00:51:07.364

WOULD ADJUST THAT BASED ON SOME

00:52:31.581 --> 00:52:33.817
TYPE OF- ADJUSTMENT THAT

00:52:33.884 --> 00:52:35.352
REFLECTS BOTH THE COST OF THOSE

00:52:35.418 --> 00:52:37.153
PRODUCTS AND THAT. NUMBER OF

CAN DEPART ANY SELLING. THE

00:58:48.324 --> 00:58:50.593
POSITIONS AND THAT DOCTOR THEM

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:52.028
UP THE CONNECT EACH OF OUR BATCH

00:58:52.095 --> 00:58:53.229
OF PETITIONS THERE FOR THAT WERE

00:58:53.296 --> 00:58:55.431
IN FACT A TO RATIO. AND EACH OF

00:58:55.498 --> 00:58:57.200
THOSE RACES WERE TOUGH- TIED TO

00:58:57.267 --> 00:58:59.002
ACTUAL NUMBERS THAT WE ARE SR.

00:58:59.068 --> 00:59:01.504

BE SERVICE TO THE POSITIONS I

00:59:05.341 --> 00:59:06.776
THINK TO GET TO THE ROOT OF YOUR

00:59:06.843 --> 00:59:08.611
QUESTION IF WE TIE THIS TO

00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:09.979

PARTNERS HAVE NOT AND COME UP

00:59:16.286 --> 00:59:17.420
WITH THAT THOROUGH METHODOLOGY

00:59:17.487 --> 00:59:19.422
BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT

00:59:19.489 --> 00:59:21.224
BECAUSE ONLY THOSE RESOURCES

00:59:21.291 --> 00:59:22.592
TIED TO RATIOS MAY BE NEEDED FOR

00:59:22.659 --> 00:59:24.961
EACH. BATCH OF. POPULATION

BUT I CAN TRY- IF IT DOESN'T

00:59:49.652 --> 00:59:51.788
WORK WE'LL JUST DO OF THE AUDIO

00:59:51.854 --> 00:59:53.156

01:00:02.665 --> 01:00:06.102
ESTABLISHED AS A AS A HEALTH

01:00:06.169 --> 01:00:08.438
CARE PROGRAM- WITH PARTNERS

01:00:08.504 --> 01:00:11.441
ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION. I AND

01:00:11.507 --> 01:00:13.176
IT WAS A CREATED THAT WAY

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:14.711
BECAUSE WE KNOWLEDGE SUBSTANCE

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:16.646
USE DISORDER IS A CHRONIC

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:18.414
DISEASE- WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:00:18.481 --> 01:00:19.882
PATIECE IN OUR SYSTEM WHO NEED

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:21.317
TREATMENT UNFORTUNATELY

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:24.387
TREATMENT IS VERY EFFECTIVE. I

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:25.722
IN THE TWO YEARS SINCE WE'VE

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:27.724
IMPLEMENTED THIS PROGRAM- WHICH

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:30.827
IS FAIRLY EARLY ON- WE HAVE SEEN

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:32.562
A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN

01:00:32.628 --> 01:00:34.530
OVERDOSE DEATHS AGAIN THAT WAS A

01:00:34.597 --> 01:00:36.833
PRIMARY OUTCOME- THAT WE WERE

01:00:36.899 --> 01:00:38.835
LOOKING FOR SINCE THIS IS A

01:00:38.901 --> 01:00:41.537
PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE.

01:00:41.604 --> 01:00:45.375
RELATED ENDEAVOR. AND SO ABOUT

01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:48.444
6060% REDUCTION. IN DEATHS

01:00:48.511 --> 01:00:51.514
COMPARED TO- BEFORE THIS PROGRAM

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:53.816
WAS IMPLEMENTED- WE ARE

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:56.786
CONTINUING TO SEE. OF THE

01:00:56.853 --> 01:00:59.922
REDUCTIONS IN OVERDOSE DEATHS IN

01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:02.191
TWENTY TWENTY ONE- ALTHOUGH

01:01:02.258 --> 01:01:05.528
THAT'S PRELIMINARY DATA. DESPITE

01:01:05.595 --> 01:01:07.296
SOME OF OUR OPERATIONS OPENING

01:01:07.363 --> 01:01:10.199
BACK UP WE CONTINUE TO SEE

01:01:10.266 --> 01:01:13.236
OVERDOSE DEATHS. SIGNIFICANTLY

01:01:13.302 --> 01:01:17.840
DOWN. WE ALSO HAVE SEEN OVERDOSE

01:01:17.907 --> 01:01:20.510
. HOSPITALIZATIONS ARE REDUCED I

01:01:20.576 --> 01:01:22.178
BELIEVE WE HAD SOME NUMBERS IN

01:01:22.245 --> 01:01:23.980
THE B. C. D. AND LISA HINES

01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:27.383
OUTLINED THEM BUT- ABOUT 227%

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:28.885
IT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:01:28.951 --> 01:01:31.554
NOW ABOUT A THIRD. REDUCTION IN

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:34.190
HOSPITALIZATIONS RELATED TO

01:01:34.257 --> 01:01:36.793
OVERDOSE. WE ARE ALSO SEEN- A

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:39.729
LOT OF OTHER- SORT OF EARLY

01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:42.065
POSITIVE OUTCOMES ARE RELATED TO

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:44.100
THIS PROGRAM. AND BESIDE THE

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:46.302
REDUCTIONS IN OVERDOSE DEATHS

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:48.504
AND HOSPITALIZATIONS UP IN THE

01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:50.873
FIRST TIME IN MY CAREER. I AM

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:53.309
RECEIVING LETTERS OF GRATITUDE

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:54.977
FROM PATIENTS AS OPPOSED TO

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:57.447
LETTERS OF GRIEVANCES ON I THINK

01:01:57.513 --> 01:01:59.315
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT OUTCOME WE

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:01.050
ALSO ACTUALLY HAVE LETTERS FROM

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:04.353
OUR CLINICIANS AS WELL WHO FIND

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.289
THIS- WORK VERY REWARDING. IT'S

01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:08.357
TOO EARLY TO DO SOME OUTCOMES TO

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:10.927
LOOK AT OUTCOMES OF POST RELEASE

01:02:10.993 --> 01:02:13.863
BUT BUT THAT IS ALSO ARE PLANNED

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:14.931
TO LOOK AT THOSE OUTCOMES AS

01:02:14.997 --> 01:02:17.834
WELL. THANK YOU I THINK THAT'S

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:20.136
GREAT I THINK THAT THE PROGRAM'S

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:21.237
DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE APPLAUDED

01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:23.306
FOR THAT SIXTY FOUR PERCENT. THE

01:02:23.372 --> 01:02:24.874
CLIENT AS WELL AS THE 27%

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:27.243
DECLINE FOR THE OVERDOSE RELATED

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:29.412
DEATH CAN YOU JUST WALK. WALK ME

01:02:29.479 --> 01:02:31.013
THROUGH THE NUMBERS JUST JUST TO

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.082
GIVE ME GIVE ME A SENSE OF WHAT.

01:02:33.149 --> 01:02:34.684
IT WAS HARD WITH A PERCENTAGE IS

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:36.619
KIND OF ARE WE TALKING. WHAT

01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:39.489
WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE AND ALSO

01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:41.891
THE HOSPITALIZATION NUMBERS.

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:44.594
SURE SO WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.496
IN TERMS OF THE OVERDOSE DEATHS

OTHER 50% OF POSITIONS ARE GOING

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:06.342

01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:08.404

WORKS IN CONNECTION TO REDUCING

01:12:51.567 --> 01:12:53.368
THE INFLOW OF NARCOTICS INTO THE

01:12:53.435 --> 01:12:55.404
PRISON SYSTEM ABOUT OBVIOUSLY

01:12:55.471 --> 01:12:58.140
THE NINE THAT WE CONTINUE TO

01:12:58.207 --> 01:12:59.808
HEAR ABOUT. IN OUR- SUB HEARING

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:01.376
THAT EVEN DURING COLD WIND.

01:13:01.443 --> 01:13:02.978
THERE WERE NO VISITORS- WE STILL

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:05.280
SAW A FIFTY AN UPTICK IN

NARCOTICS ENTERING INTO. OUR

01:13:07.616 --> 01:13:09.485
SYSTEMS AND JUST KIND OF TRYING

01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:11.754
TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE IS ANY.

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:16.892
SORT OF PARTNERSHIP THERE. I

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:17.793
DON'T KNOW THIS IS THE PROGRAM

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:19.762
THAT DEALS WITH SO THAT PARTIES

01:13:19.828 --> 01:13:21.597
I WILL DEFER ON THAT PIECE AND

01:13:21.663 --> 01:13:23.932
I'M SURE- I MEAN I WOULD JUST

01:13:23.999 --> 01:13:24.967
SAY IN GENERAL THOUGH THE

01:13:25.033 --> 01:13:26.735
QUESTIONS THAT MR TANG IS.

01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:29.605
ASKING AS TO TWO FOLD ONE

01:13:29.671 --> 01:13:30.873
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY

01:13:30.939 --> 01:13:32.741
OF HOW WE GOT TO TWO THREE

01:13:32.808 --> 01:13:33.709
HUNDRED AND TEN IT'S A SIZEABLE

01:13:33.776 --> 01:13:35.778
NUMBER WITH THE FESTIVAL-

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:37.579
INVESTMENT BUT TO IN THE PAST

01:13:37.646 --> 01:13:39.148
WE'VE DONE THESE INVESTMENTS

01:13:39.214 --> 01:13:42.084
AND- WE HAVE. FUNDED OVER FOUR

01:13:42.151 --> 01:13:43.652

HAVE CLOSE TO TWO HUNDRED

01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:51.026
VACANCIES THERE. AND SO- I THINK

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:52.060
THERE'S ALSO CONCERNS THAT WE

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:54.029
ARE. ALLOCATING FUNDS WILL MAY

01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:56.165
NOT BE ABLE TO FILL IN THE

01:13:56.231 --> 01:13:57.566
VACANCIES OR US COAL THAT HAS.

01:13:57.633 --> 01:13:59.968
FORCED US TO. A STAR PROGRAM

01:14:00.035 --> 01:14:01.503
STOP PROGRAM START IN THE MIDDLE

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:04.072
THIRD JUST CONTINUE HOW MIGHT

01:14:04.139 --> 01:14:05.841
THAT AFFECT YOU KNOW- THE

01:14:05.908 --> 01:14:07.376
SERVICES DOWN DOWN THE ROAD OR

01:14:07.442 --> 01:14:08.644

BEGIN WITH AND IT'S SOMETHING

01:14:14.817 --> 01:14:16.185
THAT THAT SB VISITED AND IN THE

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:18.821

01:19:17.752 --> 01:19:18.820
FOR REQUESTED AMOUNT WAS

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:20.689
NECESSARY GIVEN THAT THE BA

01:19:20.755 --> 01:19:22.324
PROGRAMS WERE ESTABLISHED AND

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:24.226
OPERATED WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT'S

01:19:24.292 --> 01:19:26.261
EXISTING BUDGET. AND SOME OF

01:19:26.328 --> 01:19:27.496
THOSE CAN BE FOUND WITHIN THE

PROGRAMS WITHIN THEIR EXISTING

01:19:36.004 --> 01:19:38.006
BUDGETS. ONE REASON IS THAT THE

01:19:38.073 --> 01:19:39.808
DEPARTMENT HAD ESTABLISHED NO

01:19:39.875 --> 01:19:41.343

BASIS. AS OPPOSED TO A PERMANENT

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:47.315

INSTANCE FROM PROJECT REBOUNDS

01:32:42.957 --> 01:32:44.926
PERSPECTIVE WE'VE MAPPED THE

01:32:44.992 --> 01:32:47.628
STATE AND CREATED OUTREACH TEAMS

NETWORK IN OUR- IN OUR SISTER

01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:10.384

01:33:15.489 --> 01:33:17.291

SHIPMENTS WEIGHING MENTIONS I

01:33:21.963 --> 01:33:23.331
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:33:23.397 --> 01:33:26.534
FROM TO FOREGROUND THAT THE

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:28.703
SUCCESS OF PROJECT REBOUND IS

01:33:28.769 --> 01:33:31.505
ESSENTIALLY CONTINGENT UPON THE

01:33:31.572 --> 01:33:34.108
FACT THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR

01:33:34.175 --> 01:33:36.177
STAFF HAVING INCARCERATION

01:33:36.243 --> 01:33:38.079
EXPERIENCE THEMSELVES THAT'S

01:33:38.145 --> 01:33:39.480
PART OF WHAT CREATES THE

01:33:39.547 --> 01:33:42.216
CREDIBLE MESSENGERS- THAT THAT

01:33:42.283 --> 01:33:44.352

01:33:48.856 --> 01:33:50.758
THAT OUR STAFF HAVE EXPERIENCE

01:33:50.825 --> 01:33:54.729
INCONSISTENT- APPROVAL WHEN IT

GREEN CARDS FOR PROJECT REBOUND

01:34:01.168 --> 01:34:03.471
APPROVED OUTREACH TEAMS- I THINK

01:34:03.537 --> 01:34:04.638
WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARD

01:34:04.705 --> 01:34:06.807
CREATING SOME OF THOSE THOSE

01:34:06.874 --> 01:34:08.542

POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS THERE

01:46:55.909 --> 01:46:56.943
IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE

01:46:57.010 --> 01:46:58.378

WE VIEW THIS PROPOSAL AS HAVING

01:53:45.118 --> 01:53:47.520
TWO COMPONENTS- THE FIRST IS

01:53:47.587 --> 01:53:49.022
THAT A PROPOSES TO EXPAND THE

01:53:49.088 --> 01:53:50.723
CONTRACT CONTINUE HEALTHCARE

01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:53.526
FACILITIES AS HEARD AND THEN THE

01:53:53.593 --> 01:53:55.562
SECOND IS TO PROPOSED CHANGES. I

01:53:55.628 --> 01:53:57.030
IN THE RATIO OF CUSTODIAN

01:53:57.096 --> 01:53:58.498
SUPERVISORS TAKE A STUDY AND

01:53:58.565 --> 01:54:00.433
STAFF AND THEREFORE WE ASSESSED

01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:02.035
THE PROPOSAL IN THESE TWO

01:54:02.101 --> 01:54:04.938
COMPONENTS THAT ARE- NOT SPACED

01:54:05.004 --> 01:54:06.639
OUT WITHIN THE PROPOSAL THAT

01:54:06.706 --> 01:54:08.575
GIVEN THAT THE QUALITY OF THE

01:54:08.641 --> 01:54:10.643
SERVICES PROVIDED BY CAL PA HAVE

01:54:10.710 --> 01:54:12.679
BEEN AT AN ACCEPTABLE STANDARD

01:54:12.745 --> 01:54:14.581
THAT IT DOES NOT RAISE CONCERNS.

01:54:14.647 --> 01:54:16.082
WE FIND THE PROPOSAL TO EXPAND

01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:17.584
THE CONTRACT TO INCLUDE

01:54:17.650 --> 01:54:20.520
ADDITIONAL HEALTH CARE

01:54:20.587 --> 01:54:21.254
FACILITIES REASONABLE. BUT WE

01:54:21.321 --> 01:54:22.889
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:54:22.956 --> 01:54:25.191
THE FUNDING NECESSARY TO EXPAND

01:54:25.258 --> 01:54:27.227
INTO NEW HEALTH CARE FACILITIES.

01:54:27.293 --> 01:54:28.895
HOWEVER WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:54:28.962 --> 01:54:30.597
LEGISLATURE REJECT THE SECOND

01:54:30.663 --> 01:54:32.265
PART OF THE PROPOSAL TO CHANGE

01:54:32.332 --> 01:54:34.667
THE RATIO CUSTODIAN SUPERVISORS

01:54:34.734 --> 01:54:36.636
TO CUSTODIAN STAFF. I THOUGHT

01:54:36.703 --> 01:54:38.471
OUR ASSESSMENT CHANGING THE

01:54:38.538 --> 01:54:40.707
RATIO APPEARS UNNECESSARY AND

01:54:40.773 --> 01:54:42.675
THIS IS FOR TWO REASONS. THE

01:54:42.742 --> 01:54:44.143
FIRST IS THAT WHILE COUNTY A

01:54:44.210 --> 01:54:46.379
RAISES PROBLEMS RESULTING FROM

01:54:46.446 --> 01:54:48.915
LACK OF SUPERVISORS. SO DOES NOT

01:54:48.982 --> 01:54:50.850
PROPERLY KEEPING INVENTORY OR

01:54:50.917 --> 01:54:53.419
NOT PROVIDING TIMELY EVALUATIONS

01:54:53.486 --> 01:54:55.054
WE NOTE THAT THESE PROBLEMS HAVE

01:54:55.121 --> 01:54:58.124
NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH. TO

01:54:58.191 --> 01:54:59.692
IMPACT THE QUALITY OF SERVICE

01:54:59.759 --> 01:55:01.661
PROVIDED THE SECOND REASON WE

01:55:01.728 --> 01:55:03.162
WANT WHITE CHANGING THE

01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:05.198
SUPERVISOR TO STAFF RATIO

01:55:05.265 --> 01:55:07.267
APPEARS UNNECESSARY. THAT CAP

01:55:07.333 --> 01:55:09.102
YEAH HAS NOT CLEARLY INDICATED

01:55:09.168 --> 01:55:10.837
HOW THE ADDITIONAL SUPERVISORS

01:55:10.903 --> 01:55:12.905
PROPOSED. WOULD IN FACT

01:55:12.972 --> 01:55:14.207
ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEMS THEY'VE

01:55:14.274 --> 01:55:16.142
IDENTIFIED FOR EXAMPLE IT'S

01:55:16.209 --> 01:55:17.644
POSSIBLE THAT OTHER ACTIONS SUCH

01:55:17.710 --> 01:55:20.113
AS ADDITIONAL TRAINING. IS ONE

01:55:20.179 --> 01:55:22.181
POSSIBILITY AMONG SEVERAL OTHERS

01:55:22.248 --> 01:55:23.650
THAT WOULD ADDRESS THAT

01:55:23.716 --> 01:55:25.985
IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS IN A MORE

01:55:26.052 --> 01:55:28.087
EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT MANNER.

01:55:28.154 --> 01:55:28.621
FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE

01:55:28.688 --> 01:55:29.989
RECOMMENDING THAT THE

01:55:30.056 --> 01:55:31.190
LEGISLATURE WRONG IMPROVE THE

01:55:31.257 --> 01:55:33.793
FUNDING NECESSARY TO EXPAND.

01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:34.794
INTO THE NEW HEALTH CARE

01:55:34.861 --> 01:55:36.129
FACILITIES WE ALSO RECOMMEND

01:55:36.195 --> 01:55:37.997
THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO RACK CAL

01:55:38.064 --> 01:55:40.433
QUE TO REPORT THE AMOUNT OF THE

01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:42.935
REQUESTED FUNDING. ASSOCIATED

01:55:43.002 --> 01:55:44.170
WITH CHANGING THE CUSTODIAN

01:55:44.237 --> 01:55:47.040
SUPERVISOR RATIO SEPARATELY FROM

01:55:47.106 --> 01:55:49.275
EXPANDING THE CONTRACT. WE KNOW

01:55:49.342 --> 01:55:50.877
THAT AT THE TIME OF OUR ANALYSIS

01:55:50.943 --> 01:55:52.845
LPA WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE THIS

01:55:52.912 --> 01:55:55.014
INFORMATION- BUT BASED ON

01:55:55.081 --> 01:55:56.916
LIMITED DATA WE ESTIMATE THAT

01:55:56.983 --> 01:55:58.685
SEVERAL MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THE

01:55:58.751 --> 01:56:00.386
REQUESTED FUNDING IS RELATED TO

01:56:00.453 --> 01:56:02.088
CHANGING THE SUPERVISOR TO STAFF

01:56:02.155 --> 01:56:07.660

DIDN'T THE HELP YEAH IT DOES NOT

01:59:43.643 --> 01:59:45.845
TRACK THEM INTO VISUALS WERE WE

AS FAR AS SUCCESS THE PLACEMENT

01:59:50.783 --> 01:59:52.051
. THANK THE SAID GIVEN THE LACK

01:59:52.118 --> 01:59:54.487

02:00:04.931 --> 02:00:07.066
TO BE A RACIAL DECREASE HOW DO

02:00:07.133 --> 02:00:11.637
WE JUSTIFY- THIS THIS RATIO

02:00:11.704 --> 02:00:12.638
DECREASES IT DOESN'T MAKE IT

02:00:12.705 --> 02:00:14.340
DOESN'T SEEM TO. HAS A LOT TO ME

02:00:14.407 --> 02:00:16.142
THAT WE NEED TO DECREASE RATIO

02:00:16.208 --> 02:00:17.877
BASED ON THE LACK OF DATA AND-

02:00:17.944 --> 02:00:22.748
NOW WE HAVE SO FAR. WE'VE SEEN

02:00:22.815 --> 02:00:24.617
YEAH WE DO REGULAR AUDITS THAT

02:00:24.684 --> 02:00:26.185
THEY JAPAN PROGRAM IN

02:00:26.252 --> 02:00:27.720
INSTITUTIONS AND THEY DO AN

02:00:27.787 --> 02:00:29.388
EXCELLENT JOB OF PROVIDING THE

02:00:29.455 --> 02:00:30.756
SERVICES OF CLEANING.

02:00:30.823 --> 02:00:33.626
INSTITUTIONS WHAT- CAL PA COULD

02:00:33.693 --> 02:00:35.628
DO A BETTER JOB OF IS THE

02:00:35.695 --> 02:00:38.698
MENTORING ASPECTS. OF HOPING THE

02:00:38.764 --> 02:00:39.699
CAR STRAIGHT INDIVIDUALS

02:00:39.765 --> 02:00:41.467
UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM BETTER

02:00:41.534 --> 02:00:42.935
THE DAY ARE BETTER SUITED THEY

02:00:43.002 --> 02:00:44.704
DO RECEIVE A CERTIFICATE WHEN

02:00:44.770 --> 02:00:46.172
THEY BELIEVE THAT SUCH A IT'S A

02:00:46.238 --> 02:00:48.341
CERTIFICATE PROGRAM. THAT MEETS

02:00:48.407 --> 02:00:50.977

02:00:54.914 --> 02:00:57.717
CERTIFICATE PROGRAM- AND IN THAT

02:00:57.783 --> 02:00:59.251
WAY IT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM

02:00:59.318 --> 02:01:01.454
BUT WE WOULD. WE THINK THAT WE

02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:03.222
CAN PROVIDE BETTER MENTORING AND

02:01:03.289 --> 02:01:05.324
TRAINING FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS.

02:01:05.391 --> 02:01:07.093
AS THE PROGRAM PROCEEDS THAT

02:01:07.159 --> 02:01:09.028
THERE IS LOWER THAN A FORTY TO

02:01:09.095 --> 02:01:10.630
ONE RATIO IF IT'S THAT TWENTY TO

02:01:10.696 --> 02:01:12.465
ONE RATIO THEY'RE ABLE TO

02:01:12.531 --> 02:01:13.032
PROVIDE. THAT TRAINING THAT

02:01:13.099 --> 02:01:15.835
FEEDBACK- THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM

02:01:15.901 --> 02:01:21.707
TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DUTIES. AND AS THEY GO FORWARD. BUT

02:01:21.774 --> 02:01:22.742
IF. AT THE ARE ARE SHOWING THAT

02:01:22.808 --> 02:01:26.612
THE CLEAN. IS ADEQUATE- AND IF

02:01:26.679 --> 02:01:28.514
THAT'S PART OF YOUR GOAL DO THEY

02:01:28.581 --> 02:01:30.683
NEED ADDITIONAL MENTORING. AND

02:01:30.750 --> 02:01:31.951
THEY'VE THAT MENTORING IS MEANT

02:01:32.018 --> 02:01:35.287
TO BE S. TOWARD A CAREER ONCE

02:01:35.354 --> 02:01:38.391
THEY LEAVE WE DON'T HAVE. THAT

02:01:38.457 --> 02:01:40.393
INFORMATION AVAILABLE- WHAT ARE

02:01:40.459 --> 02:01:42.294
THE GUARANTEES THAT WE'RE

02:01:42.361 --> 02:01:43.262
ACTUALLY GETTING AN ARM OUR

02:01:43.329 --> 02:01:47.233
MONEY'S WORTH HERE. THE

02:01:47.299 --> 02:01:48.668
SENTIMENT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:01:48.734 --> 02:01:52.238
FINANCE- IN REVIEW OF THOSE. I'M

02:01:52.304 --> 02:01:53.973
COMPLIANCE MONITORING UNIT

02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:57.743
REPORTS- THAT THAT'S EASY AGE CS

02:01:57.810 --> 02:02:00.746
DOES- SO OVER CALCULATES

02:02:00.813 --> 02:02:02.715
CLEANING PROCESS EASE YOU'LL

02:02:02.782 --> 02:02:05.584
FIND THAT THEY'RE NOT PERFECT

02:02:05.651 --> 02:02:07.420
THEY ARE- DOING ADEQUATE

02:02:07.486 --> 02:02:08.721
CLEANING BUT THERE'S DEFINITELY

02:02:08.788 --> 02:02:10.556
AREAS WHERE PEOPLE CAN LEARN AND

02:02:10.623 --> 02:02:12.892
IMPROVE AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT

02:02:12.958 --> 02:02:13.859
THOSE SUPERVISORS COULD

02:02:13.926 --> 02:02:16.629
POTENTIALLY DO- IS GIVING.

02:02:16.696 --> 02:02:18.097
BETTER FEEDBACK THAT WHEN PEOPLE

02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:19.532
LEAVE THEY HAVE THE SKILLS

02:02:19.598 --> 02:02:21.600
NECESSARY TO EXCEL ON ALL THOSE

02:02:21.667 --> 02:02:25.438
COMPONENTS- ACROSS THE BOARD SO

02:02:25.504 --> 02:02:27.239
AND IT. THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR

02:02:27.306 --> 02:02:30.509
IMPROVEMENT. I THINK MIGHT MAKE

02:02:30.576 --> 02:02:32.311
TO BE CLEAR MY CONCERN IS THAT

02:02:32.378 --> 02:02:34.346
IF THEY'RE NOT PLAGUE OF THEY'RE

02:02:34.413 --> 02:02:35.247
NOT GETTING JOBS IN THIS FIELD

02:02:35.314 --> 02:02:37.083
ONCE THEY LEAVE IT DOESN'T

02:02:37.149 --> 02:02:37.950
MATTER HOW WELL TRAINED THEY

02:02:38.017 --> 02:02:45.491
ARE- AND SO THE INVESTMENT SEEMS. IT IT IT'S IT SEEMS IT SEEMS

02:02:45.558 --> 02:02:47.126
THAT NECESSARY OF WE ALREADY

02:02:47.193 --> 02:02:48.894
HAVE ACT ADEQUATE- CLEANING

02:02:48.961 --> 02:02:53.399
GOING ON. THE ONE THING TO NOTE

02:02:53.466 --> 02:02:55.935
IS THAT- WHILE THEY DON'T HAVE A

02:02:56.001 --> 02:02:57.570
MECHANISM IN PLACE TO TRACK POST

02:02:57.636 --> 02:02:59.538
INCARCERATION APPOINTMENT THEY

02:02:59.605 --> 02:03:01.607
ARE- THERE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH

02:03:01.674 --> 02:03:03.409
THE EDT IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS

02:03:03.476 --> 02:03:05.044
WITH THE PRISON TO EMPLOYMENT

02:03:05.111 --> 02:03:07.480
INITIATIVE AND PART OF THAT IS

02:03:17.089 --> 02:03:18.324
THAT THIS GROUP IS DEFINITELY

02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:21.994
LOOKING INTO WAYS TO GET BETTER

02:03:22.061 --> 02:03:24.764

WITHOUT AGAIN WITH THAT DATA OR

02:03:26.465 --> 02:03:27.433
FINDING A WAY TO GET THROUGH

02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:28.734
THOSE BARRIERS THAT THEN AND WE

02:03:28.801 --> 02:03:30.402

THAT INFORMATION SO WELL MAYBE

02:03:50.823 --> 02:03:52.258
WILL BE A LITTLE BIT FAILURE AND

02:03:52.324 --> 02:03:53.993

THINGS CONSISTENT WITH THE GOALS

02:17:27.005 --> 02:17:28.974
OF THIS CHANGE IT'S REALLY

02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:30.108
IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE AND

02:17:30.175 --> 02:17:31.176
THERE'S QUITE A BIT THAT'S BEEN

02:17:31.242 --> 02:17:32.510
RAISED BY THE L. A. R. O. AND

02:17:32.577 --> 02:17:34.312
SOME IN YOUR ANALYSIS AS WELL.

02:17:34.379 --> 02:17:36.681
THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO INCREASE

02:17:36.748 --> 02:17:39.718
CAPACITY IT'S INSTEAD TO IMPROVE

02:17:39.784 --> 02:17:42.887
OF WHAT THE HOW THE FACILITIES-

02:17:42.954 --> 02:17:45.056
ARE ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

02:17:45.123 --> 02:17:47.092
YOUTH COMING THEIR WAY- I KNOW

02:17:47.158 --> 02:17:48.693
THAT WE- HAVE BEEN AT THIS

02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:50.662
HEARING FOR QUITE A WHILE SO I

02:17:50.729 --> 02:17:52.397
THINK I WOULD LIKE TO. STOP

02:17:52.464 --> 02:17:55.233
THERE AND SEE WHAT QUESTIONS YOU

02:17:55.300 --> 02:18:00.005
MAY HAVE. AND THE LEGISLATIVE

02:18:00.071 --> 02:18:02.240
ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE RECOMMEND

02:18:02.307 --> 02:18:03.842
THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE

02:18:03.908 --> 02:18:05.577
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED COUNTY

02:18:05.644 --> 02:18:07.312
OPERATED JUVENILE FACILITY

02:18:07.379 --> 02:18:09.147
GRANTS PROGRAM. BECAUSE THE

02:18:09.214 --> 02:18:11.116
ADMINISTRATION DID NOT PRODUCT

02:18:11.182 --> 02:18:13.218
PROVIDE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION.

02:18:13.284 --> 02:18:14.919
ON HOW IT ARRIVED AT THE A

02:18:14.986 --> 02:18:16.121
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND IT

02:18:16.187 --> 02:18:18.056
IS NOT CLEAR WHY ADDITIONAL

02:18:18.123 --> 02:18:20.025
FUNDING IS NECESSARY. WE WOULD

02:18:20.091 --> 02:18:23.194
LIKE TO POINT OUT A FEW THINGS

02:18:23.261 --> 02:18:24.329
THAT WENT TO THIS RECOMMENDATION

02:18:24.396 --> 02:18:25.830
. EARLY THE PROPOSAL IS NOT

02:18:25.897 --> 02:18:27.866
BASED ON A THOROUGH ASSESSMENT

02:18:27.932 --> 02:18:29.834
OF COUNTY FACILITY NEEDS. WHAT

02:18:29.901 --> 02:18:31.436
THE ADMINISTRATION DID CONDUCT A

02:18:31.503 --> 02:18:32.837
SURVEY TO DETERMINE WHETHER

02:18:32.904 --> 02:18:34.906
COUNTIES WOULD BE INTERESTED IN

02:18:34.973 --> 02:18:36.875
RECEIVING MORE FUNDS. NO

02:18:36.941 --> 02:18:38.309
ASSESSMENT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT

02:18:38.376 --> 02:18:39.778
TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC

02:18:39.844 --> 02:18:42.280
DEFICIENCIES. OR SHOW THE EXTENT

02:18:42.347 --> 02:18:44.149
TO WHICH EXISTING COUNTY

02:18:44.215 --> 02:18:46.484
FACILITIES ARE IN NEED OF REPAIR

02:18:46.551 --> 02:18:48.720
pOR NOT ADEQUATE TO PROVIDE. THE

02:18:48.787 --> 02:18:50.288
REHAB SERVICES TO RE ALIGNED

02:18:50.355 --> 02:18:52.223
YOUTH. THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT

02:18:52.290 --> 02:18:53.892
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE

02:18:53.958 --> 02:18:55.727
THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE

02:18:55.794 --> 02:18:56.761
PROPOSED A HUNDRED MILLION

02:18:56.828 --> 02:18:58.730
DOLLARS. IN ADDITION WHEN

02:18:58.797 --> 02:19:00.265
CONSIDERING WHETHER COUNTIES ARE

02:19:00.331 --> 02:19:01.633
IN NEED OF THIS FUNDING OF THE

02:19:01.700 --> 02:19:03.968
LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER

02:19:04.035 --> 02:19:05.737
TWO THINGS. THE FIRST IS THAT IN

02:19:05.804 --> 02:19:07.439
RECENT YEARS. THE LEGISLATURE

02:19:07.505 --> 02:19:09.074
HAS PROVIDED THREE HUNDRED

02:19:09.140 --> 02:19:10.809
MILLION FOR IT JOVENEL COUNTY

02:19:10.875 --> 02:19:12.844
FACILITIES THAT HAVE LED TO

02:19:12.911 --> 02:19:14.846
NEWLY CONSTRUCTED AT SPACE. AND

02:19:14.913 --> 02:19:17.382
REPAIRS THAT ARE ARE ONLY

02:19:17.449 --> 02:19:19.517
RECENTLY COMING ONLINE IS NEWLY

02:19:19.584 --> 02:19:21.052
CONSTRUCTED SPACES MAY BE IN

02:19:21.119 --> 02:19:24.022
BETTER CONDITION. AND MORE

02:19:24.089 --> 02:19:25.423
CONDUCIVE TO RE HAVE PROGRAMMING

02:19:25.490 --> 02:19:26.758
. SECOND POINT IS THAT COUNTIES

02:19:26.825 --> 02:19:28.293
HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTRACT

02:19:28.359 --> 02:19:30.161
WITH EACH OTHER FOR ADDITIONAL

02:19:30.228 --> 02:19:32.630
SPACE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME

02:19:32.697 --> 02:19:34.599
COUNTIES MAY HAVE FACILITY NEEDS

02:19:34.666 --> 02:19:36.134
SUCH COUNTIES CAN CONTRACT WITH

02:19:36.201 --> 02:19:38.203
OTHERS TO HOUSE HE'S RELYING TWO

02:19:38.269 --> 02:19:40.605
YEARS. AND IN FACT THE SURVEY BY

02:19:40.672 --> 02:19:42.340
THE SEC FOLLOWING REAIGN THEM

02:19:42.407 --> 02:19:43.975
AND FOUND THAT SEVERAL COUNTIES

02:19:44.042 --> 02:19:46.277
WOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE ON.

02:19:46.344 --> 02:19:47.045
REALIGNED YEARS FROM OTHER

02:19:47.112 --> 02:19:49.214
COUNTIES. FOR THESE REASONS WE

02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:51.149
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:19:51.216 --> 02:19:53.251
REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

02:19:53.318 --> 02:19:54.619
IF IN THE FUTURE THE

02:19:54.686 --> 02:19:55.920
ADMINISTRATION IS ABLE TO

02:19:55.987 --> 02:19:58.156
PROVIDE A DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF

02:19:58.223 --> 02:20:00.191
COUNTY JUVENILE FACILITY NEEDS.

02:20:00.258 --> 02:20:01.626
THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THESE

02:20:01.693 --> 02:20:04.162
NEWLY CONSTRUCTED BED SPACES AND

02:20:04.229 --> 02:20:06.865
THE INABILITY OF COUNTIES TO

02:20:06.931 --> 02:20:08.833
PARTNER AMONGST EACH OTHER AND

02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:10.635
THEN THE LEGISLATURE COULD

02:20:10.702 --> 02:20:12.437
CONSIDER PROVIDING FACILITY

02:20:12.504 --> 02:20:14.506
GRANTS TO THOSE COUNTIES AT THAT

02:20:14.572 --> 02:20:16.474
TIME. AND THE LAST POINT WE'D

02:20:16.541 --> 02:20:18.576
LIKE TO MAKE. IS THAT THIS

02:20:18.643 --> 02:20:21.012
PROPOSAL IS EXCLUDABLE UNDER THE

02:20:21.079 --> 02:20:23.515
STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT. AS A

02:20:23.581 --> 02:20:25.183
REMINDER TO THE LEGISLATURE THE

02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:27.552
CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION IMPOSES

02:20:27.619 --> 02:20:29.654
A LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE

02:20:29.721 --> 02:20:33.258
THE STATE CAN APPROPRIATE EACH

02:20:33.324 --> 02:20:33.925
YEAR. OFTEN CALLED THE CELL. THE

02:20:33.992 --> 02:20:34.959
STATE CAN EXCLUDE CERTAIN

02:20:35.026 --> 02:20:36.394
APPROPRIATIONS FROM THE SOUTH

02:20:36.461 --> 02:20:38.496
CALCULATION SUGGESTS BENDING ON

02:20:38.563 --> 02:20:39.998
CAPITAL OUTLAY WHICH THIS

02:20:40.064 --> 02:20:41.933
PROPOSAL WOULD FALL UNDER. AS

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:43.935
SUCH IF THE LEGISLATURE REJECTS

02:20:44.002 --> 02:20:45.470
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ITWOULD

02:20:45.537 --> 02:20:47.272
NEED TO REPURPOSE THE ASSOCIATE

02:20:47.338 --> 02:20:48.940
FUNDING FOR OTHER SOLID

02:20:49.007 --> 02:20:52.143

WHILE CERTAINLY- THERE ARE ARE

02:29:05.236 --> 02:29:08.005

WERE TO REVIEW TOGETHER THE

02:29:09.674 --> 02:29:11.075

ADULT COURT. ON LET'S KEEP IN

02:29:35.433 --> 02:29:37.301

ARENA WHERE'S WHERE A LOT OF

NOT ALL GOING TO BE DELIVERED IN

IN DETENTION FACILITIES AT THE

02:30:42.767 --> 02:30:44.068
COUNTY LEVEL THERE'S A WHOLE

02:30:44.135 --> 02:30:45.970
RANGE OF NEEDS. OUT THERE AND

02:30:46.036 --> 02:30:47.338
WHILE I KNOW ONE HUNDRED MILLION

02:30:47.405 --> 02:30:48.439
DOLLARS CERTAINLY IS A

02:30:48.506 --> 02:30:50.674
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TAXPAYER

02:30:50.741 --> 02:30:53.110
DOLLARS TO GO INTO THIS WE ALSO

02:30:53.177 --> 02:30:55.179
KNOW THAT FACILITY MODIFICATIONS

02:30:55.246 --> 02:30:57.081
TEND TO ADD UP REALLY REALLY

02:30:57.148 --> 02:30:58.916
QUICKLY AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

02:30:58.983 --> 02:31:01.619
THINGS LIKE- ADDING CLASSROOMS

02:31:01.685 --> 02:31:03.621
AND CHAINING CHANGING FURNITURE-

02:31:03.687 --> 02:31:05.156
EVEN IN SOME CASES LIKE THOSE

02:31:05.222 --> 02:31:06.557
WHO ARE HERE FROM LOS ANGELES

02:31:06.624 --> 02:31:08.192
COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY

02:31:08.259 --> 02:31:10.594
WERE TO DECIDE TO. ADD CLIMBING

02:31:10.661 --> 02:31:13.564
IN- THE ROOMS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

02:31:13.631 --> 02:31:14.632
AND THOSE JUVENILE DETENTION

02:31:14.698 --> 02:31:16.700
FACILITIES WHICH PRESENTLY DON'T

02:31:16.767 --> 02:31:18.469
HAVE TOILETS AND SINKS THOSE

02:31:18.536 --> 02:31:20.137
KINDS OF COSTS THAT UP REALLY

02:31:20.204 --> 02:31:22.173
REALLY QUICKLY SO I WOULD JUST

02:31:22.239 --> 02:31:23.841
AGREE THAT IT'S A LOT OF MONEY

02:31:23.908 --> 02:31:25.376
AND I WOULD ALSO STATE THAT THE

02:31:25.443 --> 02:31:28.145
NEEDS ARE VERY HIGH. SO YES THE

02:31:28.212 --> 02:31:30.281
POLICY HOLDERS ARE CLEARLY IN

02:31:30.347 --> 02:31:31.782
THEIR REDUCING TRANSFERS TO

02:31:31.849 --> 02:31:33.784
ADULT COURTS ARE USING THE LEAST

02:31:33.851 --> 02:31:35.453
RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT

02:31:35.519 --> 02:31:37.221
ADDRESSING THE REALLY IMPORTANT

02:31:37.288 --> 02:31:38.923
ISSUES OF REDUCING RACIAL AND

02:31:38.989 --> 02:31:40.524
ETHNIC DISPARITIES BUT THERE

02:31:40.591 --> 02:31:42.860
ALSO NEEDS TO BE A SERVICES

02:31:42.927 --> 02:31:44.895
AVAILABLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

02:31:44.962 --> 02:31:46.597
ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE AND

02:31:46.664 --> 02:31:51.302
THIS IS JUST ONE PART. OF THE

02:31:51.368 --> 02:31:54.138
CONTINUUM OF CARE. SO THIS IS

02:31:54.205 --> 02:31:56.006
JUST ONE PART OF THE CONTINUING

02:31:56.073 --> 02:31:58.876
OKAY MAYBE THAT GOES INTO. IN

02:31:58.943 --> 02:32:00.678
GENERAL MY CONCERNED WITH THIS

02:32:00.744 --> 02:32:02.213
PROPOSAL AND WHY ABOUT THAT

02:32:02.279 --> 02:32:06.650
PIECE OF. IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT WE

02:32:06.717 --> 02:32:08.752
HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN- AND

02:32:08.819 --> 02:32:10.221
THAT WE'RE MOVING IN THAT ALL

02:32:10.287 --> 02:32:11.722
THE COUNTIES ARE MOVING IN THE

02:32:11.789 --> 02:32:12.790
SAME DIRECTION IT'S NOT FAIR

02:32:12.857 --> 02:32:14.325
THAT WERE HELPING THE COUNTIES

02:32:14.391 --> 02:32:15.659
MOVE IN THE SAME DIRECTION THAT

02:32:15.726 --> 02:32:17.361
WE'RE HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE

02:32:17.428 --> 02:32:18.696
ALSO YOU MENTIONED THAT SOME

02:32:18.762 --> 02:32:19.630
COUNTIES HAVE COMMITTED PLANTS

02:32:19.697 --> 02:32:21.699
BUT NOT ALL HAVE. SO HOW DO WE

02:32:21.765 --> 02:32:23.534
MAKE SURE THIS IS AN EQUITABLE

02:32:23.601 --> 02:32:26.103
PROCESSES FOR ALL ND NOT JUST

02:32:26.170 --> 02:32:29.039
FOR SOME OUT THERE- AND THE

02:32:29.106 --> 02:32:31.075
REALITY IS THAT. MAYBE MORE THAN

02:32:31.141 --> 02:32:32.176
A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS

02:32:32.243 --> 02:32:34.678
NEEDED AT THE END OF THE DAY I

02:32:34.745 --> 02:32:36.881
AND THAT'S A REALITY THAT WE

02:32:36.947 --> 02:32:37.915
NEED TO FACE AND BE READY FOR

02:32:37.982 --> 02:32:39.750
BUT HAVING A CARE PLAN THAT THAT

02:32:39.817 --> 02:32:42.019
IS COMPREHENSIVE IS IMPORTANT

02:32:42.086 --> 02:32:44.355
AND IT IT. IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE.

02:32:44.421 --> 02:32:45.956
WE'RE WE'RE MOVING IN THAT

02:32:46.023 --> 02:32:47.725
DIRECTION I FEEL THAT WITH THAT

02:32:47.791 --> 02:32:49.627
I MONEY. TOWARD SOMETHING THAT

02:32:49.693 --> 02:32:51.962
MAYBE IS GOING TO REPEAT A LOT

02:32:52.029 --> 02:32:53.898
OF WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE. WELL I

02:32:53.964 --> 02:32:55.032
PUBLIC THINGS IN RESPONSE THAT

02:32:55.099 --> 02:32:56.567
I'M SORRY IF I GAVE YOU THE

02:32:56.634 --> 02:32:58.235
IMPRESSION THAT NOT ALL COUNTY

02:32:58.302 --> 02:32:59.470
SUBMITTED PLANS THEY ABSOLUTELY

02:32:59.537 --> 02:33:01.438
DID. I JUST REFERENCE THAT I'VE

02:33:01.505 --> 02:33:03.407
REVIEWED SEVERAL AND NOT ALL ON

02:33:03.474 --> 02:33:04.842
BUT ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES DID

02:33:04.909 --> 02:33:07.044
SUBMIT THEIR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

02:33:07.111 --> 02:33:07.978
TO THE OFFICE OF YOUTH AND

02:33:08.045 --> 02:33:09.914
COMMUNITY RESTORATION. AND IT'S

02:33:09.980 --> 02:33:11.782
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT A Y. C. R.

02:33:11.849 --> 02:33:13.350
WILL BE MEETING WITH EACH AND

02:33:13.417 --> 02:33:14.852
EVERY COUNTY TO REVIEW THOSE

02:33:14.919 --> 02:33:17.821
PLANS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND- WHAT

02:33:17.888 --> 02:33:19.757
THEY HAVE IN MIND AND DID BEGIN

02:33:19.823 --> 02:33:21.258
THIS I THINK. REALLY IMPORTANT

02:33:21.325 --> 02:33:24.728
PRACTICE OF ENSURING THAT- THAT

02:33:24.795 --> 02:33:27.031
COUNTIES HAVE ACCESS TO OUR

02:33:27.097 --> 02:33:29.366
ADVICE ON BEST PRACTICES TRAUMA

02:33:29.433 --> 02:33:30.734
INFORMED APPROACHES AND SO ON

02:33:30.801 --> 02:33:33.070
AND SO FORTH- I GUESS IT WOULD

02:33:33.137 --> 02:33:35.606
BE. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY POSSIBLE

02:33:35.673 --> 02:33:36.941
THAT WE COULD ALL COME TO

02:33:37.007 --> 02:33:38.409
AGREEMENT THAT. A HUNDRED

02:33:38.475 --> 02:33:39.843
MILLION DOLLARS FOR COUNTY

02:33:39.910 --> 02:33:42.146
FACILITY NEEDS ISN'T SUFFICIENT

02:33:42.212 --> 02:33:44.615
BUT- I'M JUST MOST CONCERNED

02:33:44.682 --> 02:33:46.317
ABOUT THE- URGENT NEED TO MAKE

02:33:46.383 --> 02:33:48.185
SOME OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS. SO

02:33:48.252 --> 02:33:51.355
THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO- ARE CAN

02:33:51.422 --> 02:33:53.290
BE APPROPRIATELY PLACED IN THE

02:33:53.357 --> 02:33:54.992
COUNTY JUVENILE FACILITY THAT

02:33:55.059 --> 02:33:56.727
THAT OPTION EXISTS AND THAT

02:33:56.794 --> 02:33:58.195
JUDGES AND DISTRICT ATTORNEYS

02:33:58.262 --> 02:34:00.197
AND PROBATION DEPARTMENTS- ARE

02:34:00.264 --> 02:34:02.399
ABLE TO HAVE THAT OPTION. AS

02:34:02.466 --> 02:34:04.835
OPPOSED TO INCREASING TRANSFERS

02:34:04.902 --> 02:34:07.037
TO ADULT COURT. BOB THIS IS VERY

02:34:07.104 --> 02:34:09.073
MUCH YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF BEING

02:34:09.139 --> 02:34:10.741
MAJOR IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES

02:34:10.808 --> 02:34:13.210
THAT ARE ALL IN FLUX. AND THE

02:34:13.277 --> 02:34:15.412
FACILITY NEEDS HAVE EMERGED AS

02:34:15.479 --> 02:34:19.483
ONE OF THE. MORE TIME SENSITIVE

02:34:19.550 --> 02:34:21.251
ONES. IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE

02:34:21.318 --> 02:34:23.587
MERCH AS TIME SENSITIVE ONE

02:34:23.654 --> 02:34:26.724
WHEN. THE INITIAL NEGOTIATIONS-

02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:29.393
DID NOT INCLUDE. INFRASTRUCTURE

02:34:29.460 --> 02:34:31.095
RESOURCES BECAUSE THERE WASN'T

02:34:31.161 --> 02:34:34.164
THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH DATA- THAN.

02:34:34.231 --> 02:34:35.666
I IN THE PLANS THAT THE COUNTY

02:34:35.733 --> 02:34:36.967
SOMETHING ADDED I DON'T THINK

02:34:37.034 --> 02:34:39.970
HAVE. DO MUCH. WITH THE

02:34:40.037 --> 02:34:42.373
FACILITIES EITHER. AND SO I JUST

02:34:42.439 --> 02:34:44.441
WORRY THAT SEVENTEEN MONTHS WILL

02:34:44.508 --> 02:34:46.710
BE HERE QUICK- I UNDERSTAND THE

02:34:46.777 --> 02:34:48.212
SHORT WINDOW OF TIME AND I

02:34:48.278 --> 02:34:50.481
UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY IN THE

02:34:50.547 --> 02:34:51.515
MAGNITUDE OF THE WORK THAT NEEDS

02:34:51.582 --> 02:34:53.417
TO BE DONE. IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME

02:34:53.484 --> 02:34:55.753
THAT WE ARE PRIORITIZING THE

02:34:55.819 --> 02:34:58.022
ACTUAL WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE

02:34:58.088 --> 02:34:59.690
DONE VERSUS. TO SAYING WE DID

02:34:59.757 --> 02:35:01.592
SOMETHING. I AND SO LET'S DO

02:35:01.659 --> 02:35:04.328
THIS- AND SO THAT'S THAT'S MY

02:35:04.395 --> 02:35:06.397
CONCERN THERE. I DON'T KNOW YOU

02:35:06.463 --> 02:35:10.601
WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT- WELL I

02:35:10.668 --> 02:35:11.935
MEAN I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU

02:35:12.002 --> 02:35:13.871
THAT THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS

02:35:13.937 --> 02:35:15.706
COMPETING PRIORITIES THAT NEED

02:35:15.773 --> 02:35:16.840
TO BE ADDRESSED TO ENSURE

02:35:16.907 --> 02:35:19.677
SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF

02:35:19.743 --> 02:35:22.346
THIS AND- HE FOR THIS

02:35:22.413 --> 02:35:24.381
CONVERSATION TODAY ON WATER THAT

02:35:24.448 --> 02:35:26.684
DEFICIENCIES IN FACILITIES AND

02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:28.419
IT IS SOME OF WHAT FRANKIE WAS

02:35:28.485 --> 02:35:31.221
MINE MENTIONED YOU KNOW A MORE

02:35:31.288 --> 02:35:33.757
RESTRICTIVE AND- JAIL LIKE

02:35:33.824 --> 02:35:35.459
ENVIRONMENT FOR YOUTH WILL WHERE

02:35:35.526 --> 02:35:38.162
POSSIBLE BUT THE GOLAN THE HOPE

02:35:38.228 --> 02:35:40.164
IS TO STOP IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS

02:35:40.230 --> 02:35:43.067
MAKE THEM MORE HOME LIKE- AND

02:35:43.133 --> 02:35:44.368
ALSO PAY ATTENTION TO THE OVER

02:35:44.435 --> 02:35:46.403
ARCHING POLICY GOAL OF. LEAST

02:35:46.470 --> 02:35:48.939
RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT- BUT I

02:35:49.006 --> 02:35:49.807
THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT KEEP

02:35:49.873 --> 02:35:51.375
IN MIND THAT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A

02:35:51.442 --> 02:35:53.277
VARIETY OF PROGRAMMING AND

02:35:53.343 --> 02:35:55.045
TREATMENT AND REHABILITATIVE

02:35:55.112 --> 02:35:59.917
NEEDS THAT THAT HAVE TO BE BACK

02:35:59.983 --> 02:36:01.785
. WHEN I AGREE WITH THE LAST

02:36:01.852 --> 02:36:03.954
PART OF YOUR STATEMENT I'M NOT

02:36:04.021 --> 02:36:05.656
CONVINCED THAT THIS HUNDRED

02:36:05.723 --> 02:36:07.224
MILLION IN INFRASTRUCTURE. IS

02:36:07.291 --> 02:36:08.492
ADDRESSING THAT LAST PART OF

02:36:08.559 --> 02:36:10.094
YOUR STATEMENT I THINK WE DO

02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:11.595
SHARE THE COMMON GOAL I THINK

02:36:11.662 --> 02:36:13.163
IT'S THE QUESTION IS ARE WE

02:36:13.230 --> 02:36:14.498
INVEST IN A WAY THAT GETS US TO

02:36:14.565 --> 02:36:15.866
THAT COMMON GOAL AND I'M NOT

02:36:15.933 --> 02:36:17.801
CONVINCED OF THAT. AT AT THIS

02:36:17.868 --> 02:36:22.239
POINT. MR STILL. THANK YOU AND

02:36:22.306 --> 02:36:23.140
JUST TO REITERATE WITH THE

02:36:23.207 --> 02:36:25.375
CHAIRED SAID NGUYEN THE PROPOSAL

02:36:25.442 --> 02:36:26.477
FIRST CAME TO US THROUGH THERE

02:36:26.543 --> 02:36:28.912
WAS. IN THIS COMMITTEE A LOT OF

02:36:28.979 --> 02:36:33.817
SUPPORT FOR. REFORMING DJJ BUT I

02:36:33.884 --> 02:36:35.285
THINK SOME CONCERN ABOUT WHAT

02:36:35.352 --> 02:36:36.987
THE IMPLEMENTATION WAS THAT AND

02:36:37.054 --> 02:36:38.088
I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

02:36:38.155 --> 02:36:40.090
HEARING. HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

02:36:40.157 --> 02:36:42.126
TO ME LOOKING AT STATEWIDE NEEDS

02:36:42.192 --> 02:36:43.427
PROBABLY DOESN'T SOUND LIKE

02:36:43.494 --> 02:36:44.428
ENOUGH AND THIS IS JUST THE

02:36:44.495 --> 02:36:45.462
BUDGET WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:36:45.529 --> 02:36:47.164
BUDGETING MONEY SO WHAT THE

02:36:47.231 --> 02:36:48.932
ULTIMATELY IMPORTANT HERE.

02:36:48.999 --> 02:36:50.434
BEFORE THAT MONEY GETS SPENT IS

02:36:50.501 --> 02:36:53.103
UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS. AND

02:36:53.170 --> 02:36:54.938
LAST YEAR WE WENT AROUND AND

02:36:55.005 --> 02:36:57.741
AROUND WITH THE- I SEE ARE AND

02:36:57.808 --> 02:36:59.476
WHAT OUR EXPECTATION OF THEIR

02:36:59.543 --> 02:37:01.779
MISSION IS AND HOW THEY ARE

02:37:01.845 --> 02:37:03.614
GOING TO FUNCTION. WITHIN THE

02:37:03.680 --> 02:37:05.082
STATE IN FACT WE WANTED TO SPEND

02:37:05.149 --> 02:37:07.684
MORE MONEY WITH THE YC R. THAN

02:37:07.751 --> 02:37:08.752
THAT HAD BEEN PROPOSED AND THE

02:37:08.819 --> 02:37:10.521
REASON IS. THAT IF THAT AGENCY

02:37:10.587 --> 02:37:15.359
IS NOT. IS NOT CREATED TO HAVE

02:37:15.425 --> 02:37:17.528
THE STRENGTH THE RESEARCH

02:37:17.594 --> 02:37:20.464
ABILITY THE ABILITY REALLY TO

02:37:20.531 --> 02:37:22.499
LAY OUT BEST PRACTICES AND-

02:37:22.566 --> 02:37:25.836
WHAT'S GOOD INCENTIVES ARE GOOD

02:37:25.903 --> 02:37:27.404
OPTIONS IN FRONT OF COUNTIES TO

02:37:27.471 --> 02:37:28.839
ENSURE THAT THOSE COUNTIES AND

02:37:28.906 --> 02:37:31.575
ARE ARE IMPLEMENTING THOSE THEN

02:37:31.642 --> 02:37:34.378
WE'RE JUST KIND OF PERPETUATING

02:37:34.444 --> 02:37:35.779
AT A LOCAL LEVEL WHAT HAD BEEN

02:37:35.846 --> 02:37:37.748
DEVELOPED AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL

02:37:37.815 --> 02:37:38.749
THAT'S NOT REALLY SERVING THE

02:37:38.816 --> 02:37:40.450
KIDS SO IT'S I THINK THE

02:37:40.517 --> 02:37:43.120
FRUSTRATION HERE. IS AROUND THE

02:37:43.187 --> 02:37:44.655
TIMING OF THE WAY THE PROCESS

02:37:44.721 --> 02:37:47.090
COMES TOGETHER THAT IF WE ARE

02:37:47.157 --> 02:37:50.761
JUST HAVING A PART OF MONEY IN

02:37:50.828 --> 02:37:51.461
THE DESIRING TO SPEND IT. THE

02:37:51.528 --> 02:37:53.430
OUTCOMES ARE UNCERTAIN. AND WE

02:37:53.497 --> 02:37:54.698
COULD HAVE CREATED SOMETHING

02:37:54.765 --> 02:37:56.333
HERE THAT WILL BE DETRIMENTAL TO

02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:59.703
OUR KIDS. IF THE IF PART OF THIS

02:37:59.770 --> 02:38:01.271
IS IT WILL I'M NOT SURE IT'S

02:38:01.338 --> 02:38:03.907
CLEAR FOR US THE ROLE OF- I SEE

02:38:03.974 --> 02:38:06.243
ARE THROUGH THIS PROCESS. AND

02:38:06.310 --> 02:38:07.711
THE GOAL WITH CREATING OVERSEE

02:38:07.778 --> 02:38:09.379
OUR WAS WAS FOR US SINCE WE

02:38:09.446 --> 02:38:10.681
WEREN'T NECESSARILY GOING TO BE

02:38:10.747 --> 02:38:11.715
THIS ABOUT A PROBLEM WITH

02:38:11.782 --> 02:38:13.350
REALIGNMENT ACROSS THE BOARD.

02:38:13.417 --> 02:38:15.719
MANDATING CERTAIN PROGRAMS WORK

02:38:15.786 --> 02:38:16.820
THAT SINCE WE'RE ALLOWING THE

02:38:16.887 --> 02:38:18.455
COUNTIES TO DO THE

02:38:18.522 --> 02:38:21.592
IMPLEMENTATION. WE THEN ARE

02:38:21.658 --> 02:38:24.194
INCENTIVIZING CAJOLING CREATING

02:38:24.261 --> 02:38:26.396
SOME. OPPORTUNITIES FOR COUNTIES

02:38:26.463 --> 02:38:28.165
TO SEE WHERE THEIR BEST

02:38:28.232 --> 02:38:30.133
OPPORTUNITIES ARE. THIS IS A LOT

02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:31.835
OF MONEY I'M NOT SURE IT'S GOING

02:38:31.902 --> 02:38:33.770
TO BE ENOUGH MONEY BUT THIS IS A

02:38:33.837 --> 02:38:35.539
SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE

02:38:35.606 --> 02:38:37.708
INCENTIVES. THAT WE'RE GOING TO

02:38:37.774 --> 02:38:39.610
NEED TO SEE IS OKAY COUNTIES YOU

02:38:39.676 --> 02:38:40.777
WANT TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT

02:38:40.844 --> 02:38:42.479
SOMETHING. WE NEED TO KNOW THAT

02:38:42.546 --> 02:38:43.981
YOU'RE IMPLEMENTATION IS IT IS

02:38:44.047 --> 02:38:45.883
THIS VISION OF. BEST

02:38:45.949 --> 02:38:47.484
OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUTH FOR

02:38:47.551 --> 02:38:49.086
THEIR DEVELOPMENT FOR THEIR

02:38:49.152 --> 02:38:52.923
FUTURE HOW DOES YOUR PROGRAM HOW

02:38:52.990 --> 02:38:56.360
DOES YOUR PLAN. FIT THE STATE'S

02:38:56.426 --> 02:38:58.462
ULTIMATE GOAL AND IF IT DOES

02:38:58.528 --> 02:39:00.364
THEN YES COUNTIES ARE GOING TO

02:39:00.430 --> 02:39:01.632
HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THESE

02:39:01.698 --> 02:39:02.933
KINDS OF INVESTMENTS THE STATE

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:04.801
IS GOING TO HAVE TO STEP IN AND

02:39:04.868 --> 02:39:06.837
PROVIDE THOSE KINDS OF. THAT

02:39:06.904 --> 02:39:08.472
THAT HELP FOR THOSE INVESTMENTS

02:39:08.538 --> 02:39:10.540
. BUT IT THEY NEED TO BE WE NEED

02:39:10.607 --> 02:39:12.309
TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE. THAT

02:39:12.376 --> 02:39:14.244
THOSE COUNTY PROGRAMS ARE

02:39:14.311 --> 02:39:15.345
BENEFITING THE KIDS THE WAY THAT

02:39:15.412 --> 02:39:17.481
WE ARE VISITING AND SO I THINK

02:39:17.547 --> 02:39:19.616
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HEARING HERE

02:39:19.683 --> 02:39:20.484
WIT WITH THE CONCERNED AND A

02:39:20.550 --> 02:39:24.254
LITTLE BIT OF. IS THE TIMING AND

02:39:24.321 --> 02:39:25.989
WE SEEM TO OFTEN WHERE THERE'S

02:39:26.056 --> 02:39:27.190
LARGE PARTS OF MONEY EVERYBODY

02:39:27.257 --> 02:39:29.026
WANTS US POTS OF MONEY. WE FIND

02:39:29.092 --> 02:39:30.961
WAYS TO GET OUT THE DOOR.

02:39:31.028 --> 02:39:32.529
THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE HERE

02:39:32.596 --> 02:39:33.997
WITH THESE KIDS TO DO THAT TOO

02:39:34.064 --> 02:39:35.065
QUICKLY SO I THINK THIS

02:39:35.132 --> 02:39:36.633
COMMITTEE. WOULD BE BETTER

02:39:36.700 --> 02:39:38.735
SERVED UNDERSTANDING THE VARIOUS

02:39:38.802 --> 02:39:40.771
ROLES HERE UNDERSTANDING WHAT

02:39:40.837 --> 02:39:42.205
SOME OF THE CONSTRAINTS ARE WHAT

02:39:42.272 --> 02:39:43.807
SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS ARE

02:39:43.874 --> 02:39:46.677
WHAT THE COUNTY'S PLANS ARE. AND

02:39:46.743 --> 02:39:48.812
THESE ARE GOING TO BE NOT

02:39:48.879 --> 02:39:50.747
NECESSARILY COUNTY BY COUNTY

02:39:50.814 --> 02:39:51.982
FACILITIES BECAUSE SOME OF OUR

02:39:52.049 --> 02:39:53.517
SMALL COUNTIES ARE NOT GOING TO

02:39:53.583 --> 02:39:54.451
HAVE. THE RESOURCES TO BE BLE

02:39:54.518 --> 02:39:57.454
TO DEVELOP AND MANAGE SOME OF

02:39:57.521 --> 02:39:59.122
SOME OF WHAT THE THEIR

02:39:59.189 --> 02:40:00.590
OBLIGATIONS ARE GOING TO BE IT

02:40:00.657 --> 02:40:02.492
WILL NEED TO BE ON A REGIONAL

02:40:02.559 --> 02:40:03.894
BASIS. AND SO FOR US TO

02:40:03.961 --> 02:40:05.062
UNDERSTAND WHAT SOME WHAT'S

02:40:05.128 --> 02:40:06.063
GOING TO BE REGIONAL WHAT'S

02:40:06.129 --> 02:40:07.564
GOING TO BE SPECIFIC COUNTY

02:40:07.631 --> 02:40:08.532
WHICH COUNTIES ARE GOING TO GET

02:40:08.598 --> 02:40:10.500
WHAT. TELL WHAT THOSE RESOURCES

02:40:10.567 --> 02:40:12.469
ARE SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. NOT

02:40:12.536 --> 02:40:13.570
NECESSARILY EQUALLY BUT

02:40:13.637 --> 02:40:15.172
EQUITABLY ACROSS THE STATE THE

02:40:15.238 --> 02:40:16.873
OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERY KID IN

02:40:16.940 --> 02:40:18.842
EVERY COUNTY. TO HAVE THE SAME

02:40:18.909 --> 02:40:22.012
ABILITY. TO ADDRESS WHATEVER IT

02:40:22.079 --> 02:40:24.481
IS THEY THEY NEED TO ADDRESS TO

02:40:24.548 --> 02:40:25.716
BECOME PRODUCTIVE TO GET OUT OF

02:40:25.782 --> 02:40:27.217
THE SYSTEM. BACK INTO SCHOOL

02:40:27.284 --> 02:40:28.785
BACK INTO JOBS BACK INTO OUR

02:40:28.852 --> 02:40:30.487
COMMUNITY IN A PRODUCTIVE WAY.

02:40:30.554 --> 02:40:31.788
SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

02:40:31.855 --> 02:40:33.657
HEARING FROM ME PERSONALLY. THE

02:40:33.724 --> 02:40:34.925
HUNDRED MILLION SOUNDS LIKE A

02:40:34.992 --> 02:40:36.393
BIG NUMBER I THINK IN THE END

02:40:36.460 --> 02:40:37.961
IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE

02:40:38.028 --> 02:40:39.129
ENOUGH BUT WHAT'S MOST

02:40:39.196 --> 02:40:40.864
IMPORTANT. IS THAT WE UNDERSTAND

02:40:40.931 --> 02:40:42.566
THE PROCESS BY WHICH THESE

02:40:42.632 --> 02:40:44.868
GRANTS ARE BEING. ARTICULATED

02:40:44.935 --> 02:40:46.803
BEING DEVELOPED AND THEN BEING

02:40:46.870 --> 02:40:48.505
AWARDED AND THEN WHAT THE

02:40:48.572 --> 02:40:51.208
ACCOUNTABILITY IS. SO I THINK

02:40:51.274 --> 02:40:52.876
THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE

02:40:52.943 --> 02:40:53.844
FRUSTRATION IS THAT YOU'RE

02:40:53.910 --> 02:40:56.113
HEARING. WE WANT YOU WE NEED YOU

02:40:56.179 --> 02:40:58.548
TO DO WITH HOW. WE ACROSS THE

02:40:58.615 --> 02:41:00.550
BOARD WITH ALL OF THESE. BUT WE

02:41:00.617 --> 02:41:02.052
ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND AWAY SEE

02:41:02.119 --> 02:41:04.554
OURS ROLE. EN SUITE WHAT THEIR

02:41:04.621 --> 02:41:06.023
VISION IS THAT THEY'RE JUST

02:41:06.089 --> 02:41:08.291
GETTING THAT STARTED. SO THINK

02:41:08.358 --> 02:41:11.194
THE CAUTION IS. NOT TO DO THIS

02:41:11.261 --> 02:41:12.996
TOO QUICKLY EVEN THOUGH I

02:41:13.063 --> 02:41:14.331
UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO MOVE

02:41:14.398 --> 02:41:15.832
QUICKLY ON THIS IN THE POSITION

02:41:15.899 --> 02:41:17.934
THAT THE COUNTIES ARE IN BUT WE

02:41:18.001 --> 02:41:19.936
ALSO HAVE TO BE CLEAR THAT WHAT

02:41:20.003 --> 02:41:21.238
WE'RE INVESTING IN THROUGH THIS

02:41:21.304 --> 02:41:23.407
PROCESS. MEATS ARE UNDERLYING

02:41:23.473 --> 02:41:30.313
GOALS HERE. THE MANAGER MY

02:41:30.380 --> 02:41:34.751
RESPONSE. YES THANK YOU-

02:41:34.818 --> 02:41:36.153

02:41:36.219 --> 02:41:37.487
YOUR COMMENTS WERE VERY WELL

02:41:37.554 --> 02:41:40.724
TAKEN- THE TIME URGENCY AS WE'VE

02:41:40.791 --> 02:41:42.259
SPOKEN ABOUT A COUPLE OF TIMES

02:41:42.325 --> 02:41:43.860
REALLY HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT

02:41:43.927 --> 02:41:45.595
THAT IN SEVENTEEN MONTHS

02:41:45.662 --> 02:41:47.330
COUNTIES ARE GOING TO NEED TO

02:41:47.397 --> 02:41:51.468
HAVE- LET'S HOPE-

02:41:51.535 --> 02:41:52.869
DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE

02:41:52.936 --> 02:41:55.305
TRAUMA INFORMED CULTURALLY

02:41:55.372 --> 02:41:58.075
SENSITIVE EVIDENCE BASED-

02:41:58.141 --> 02:42:01.211
OPTIONS AS THEY ARE- YOU KNOW

02:42:01.278 --> 02:42:03.613
APPEARING BEFORE THE JUVENILE

02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:06.683
COURT- I JUST WANTED TO MENTION

02:42:06.750 --> 02:42:09.486
ONE OTHER THING AND I'M THE

02:42:09.553 --> 02:42:11.254
ALLEY- MENTIONED- THE TOPIC OF

02:42:11.321 --> 02:42:12.556
THE FACT THAT IT IS. IT'S

02:42:12.622 --> 02:42:14.057
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT NOT EVERY

02:42:14.124 --> 02:42:15.325
COUNTY ACROSS OUR FIFTY EIGHT

02:42:15.392 --> 02:42:17.427
COUNTIES. HAS JUVENILE DETENTION

02:42:17.494 --> 02:42:19.429
FACILITIES THERE ABSOLUTELY WILL

02:42:19.496 --> 02:42:21.398
BE A VARIETY OF COUNTIES THAT

02:42:21.465 --> 02:42:22.899
NEED TO WORK WITH LET'S HOPE

02:42:22.966 --> 02:42:24.267
MAJOR NEIGHBORING COUNTIES OR

02:42:24.334 --> 02:42:26.803
OR- YOU KNOW REGIONS WITHIN THE

02:42:26.870 --> 02:42:28.405
STATE BUT IT'S FIGHT WE CAN

02:42:28.472 --> 02:42:30.607
PROVIDE A LIST- TO THE BUDGET

02:42:30.674 --> 02:42:31.741
COMMITTEE STAFF WITH THEIR

02:42:31.808 --> 02:42:33.243
FIFTEEN COUNTIES IN THE STATE.

02:42:33.310 --> 02:42:34.177
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY JUVENILE

02:42:34.244 --> 02:42:36.580
DETENTION FACILITY SO I USE THAT

02:42:36.646 --> 02:42:38.215
AS ONE EXAMPLE OF I THINK IT

02:42:38.281 --> 02:42:41.418
WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY DOABLE TO

02:42:41.485 --> 02:42:44.020

02:42:48.892 --> 02:42:50.260

GOALS THAT ARE. WOVEN THROUGH SB

02:42:59.035 --> 02:42:59.603
EIGHT TWENTY THREE I THINK IT'S

02:42:59.669 --> 02:43:01.505
COMPLETELY DOABLE AND I'LL JUST

02:43:01.571 --> 02:43:03.740
SAY AGAIN THE TIME URGENCY COMES

02:43:03.807 --> 02:43:06.443
FROM THE FACT THAT- DJJ IS

02:43:06.510 --> 02:43:07.978

YOUR- AGENDA LAID OUT THE

02:44:20.417 --> 02:44:23.086
ISSUES- REALLY WELL- AND THE

02:44:23.153 --> 02:44:24.387
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE HAS

02:44:24.454 --> 02:44:26.256
RAISED SOME SIMILAR CONCERNS

02:44:26.323 --> 02:44:29.125
ABOUT. HOW WILL WE KNOW IF SUCH

02:44:29.192 --> 02:44:31.761
A PROGRAM IS SUCCESSFUL- IT

02:44:31.828 --> 02:44:33.230
CALLS IN OBJECTIVES ARE NOT

02:44:33.296 --> 02:44:35.732
SPELLED OUT SO. I WOULD

02:44:35.799 --> 02:44:36.766
ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WOULD

02:44:36.833 --> 02:44:38.735
ABSOLUTELY BE NOT ONLY THE NEED

02:44:38.802 --> 02:44:40.003
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MORE

02:44:40.070 --> 02:44:41.905
SPECIFICALLY STATE GOALS FOR

02:44:41.972 --> 02:44:43.840
THIS PROGRAM AS WE CONTINUE TO

02:44:43.907 --> 02:44:45.675
MOVE THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS.

02:44:45.742 --> 02:44:47.811
I KNOW THAT YOU MADAM CHAIR AND

02:44:47.877 --> 02:44:49.379

02:44:51.114 --> 02:44:52.849
THE- EXTENSIVE GRANT

02:44:52.916 --> 02:44:57.554
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT. THE PSEC

02:44:59.723 --> 02:45:00.790
IF I MAY I THINK WE DO A- GOOD

02:45:00.857 --> 02:45:02.826
JOB WHEN WE HAVE A NEW GRANT

02:45:02.892 --> 02:45:04.461
PROGRAM TO BRING SUBJECT MATTER

02:45:04.527 --> 02:45:06.630
EXPERTS TO THE TABLE- FROM A

02:45:06.696 --> 02:45:09.199
WIDE VARIETY OF BACKGROUNDS- AND

02:45:09.266 --> 02:45:10.300
DISCIPLINES AND LIVED

02:45:10.367 --> 02:45:13.703
EXPERIENCES SOMEONE. SO DOWN THE

02:45:13.770 --> 02:45:15.472
ROAD AFTER SOME MORE SPECIFIC

02:45:15.538 --> 02:45:16.640
CALLS MIGHT BE SPELLED OUT BY

02:45:16.706 --> 02:45:18.875
THE LEGISLATURE THAT EXECUTIVE

02:45:18.942 --> 02:45:20.210
STEERING COMMITTEE THAT BUILDS

02:45:20.277 --> 02:45:22.545
THE GRANT- ITSELF THE REQUEST

02:45:22.612 --> 02:45:23.980
FOR PROPOSALS AND SCORING

02:45:24.047 --> 02:45:26.082
CRITERIA AND ALL OF THAT- THERE

02:45:26.149 --> 02:45:28.251
WOULD BE ALL OF THE- NECESSARY

02:45:28.318 --> 02:45:30.520
ACCOUNTABILITY IN PLACE SO. THAT

02:45:30.587 --> 02:45:35.992
THIS INVESTMENT IN- YOU KNOW.

02:45:36.059 --> 02:45:40.030
INSURING GUNS ARE- THAT WE HAVE

02:45:40.096 --> 02:45:41.464
A REDUCTION IN GUNS AND THAT WE

02:45:41.531 --> 02:45:43.099
HAVE A BETTER ABILITY TO EDUCATE

02:45:43.166 --> 02:45:45.302
YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT ON THE

02:45:45.368 --> 02:45:46.469
DANGERS OF GUNS AND GUN

02:45:46.536 --> 02:45:48.705
VIOLENCE- WE CAN GET TO SOME

02:45:48.772 --> 02:45:50.840
SHARED GOALS- AGREEMENT ON WHAT

02:45:50.907 --> 02:45:53.209
THE SHARED GOALS SHOULD BE A

02:45:53.276 --> 02:45:54.678
BUSY SEASON A REALLY GOOD

02:45:54.744 --> 02:45:56.246
POSITION TO IMPLEMENT A NEW

02:45:56.313 --> 02:45:58.515
CRAFT PROGRAM SO I KNOW WE'RE

02:45:58.581 --> 02:45:59.649
GOING TO HEAR ABOUT THE LACK OF

02:45:59.716 --> 02:46:01.985
SPECIFICITY- IN THIS PROPOSAL

02:46:02.052 --> 02:46:03.153
AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TALK FURTHER

02:46:03.219 --> 02:46:05.055
ON. HOW TO GET THIS IN SHAPE

02:46:05.121 --> 02:46:08.725
THAT THIS SUBCOMMITTEE IS MORE

02:46:08.792 --> 02:46:12.495
COMFORTABLE WITH. AND IT I NEED

02:46:12.562 --> 02:46:13.296
ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE

02:46:13.363 --> 02:46:15.165
ANALYST'S OFFICE- MISS HOWARD

02:46:15.231 --> 02:46:16.833
DID PREVIOUS OVER COMMENTS FOR

02:46:16.900 --> 02:46:21.304
YOU- AND SO THIS PROPOSAL IS ONE

02:46:21.371 --> 02:46:23.440
OF NINE TOTAL PROPOSAL THAT MAKE

02:46:23.506 --> 02:46:24.708
UP THE GOVERNOR'S PUBLIC SAFETY

02:46:24.774 --> 02:46:27.877
PACKAGE- WE DID RAISE CONCERNS

02:46:27.944 --> 02:46:29.145
WITH ABOUT SEVEN OF THEM AND

02:46:29.212 --> 02:46:30.847
RECENTLY REPORT. RELEASED A

02:46:30.914 --> 02:46:32.949
REPORT THAT OFFERS A FRAMEWORK

02:46:33.016 --> 02:46:34.718
FOR LEGISLATIVE DELIBERATION OF

02:46:34.784 --> 02:46:36.786
THE PACKAGE IN IT IN TOTAL. AS

02:46:36.853 --> 02:46:38.321
WELL AS OPTIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE

02:46:38.388 --> 02:46:41.057
CONSIDERATION- MY COMMENTS TODAY

02:46:41.124 --> 02:46:42.559
ARE GONNA FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON

02:46:42.625 --> 02:46:45.862
FIREARMS AND THIS PROPOSAL. SO

02:46:45.929 --> 02:46:46.930
SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THIS

02:46:46.996 --> 02:46:49.366
PROPOSAL. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT

02:46:49.432 --> 02:46:51.134
THIS PROPOSED GRANT PROGRAM

02:46:51.201 --> 02:46:53.103
ALONG WITH A COUPLE OF OTHER-

02:46:53.169 --> 02:46:55.071
BUT YOU'LL BE HEARING AT A LATER

02:46:55.138 --> 02:46:56.272
HEARING. WOULD PROVIDE THE SEC

02:46:56.339 --> 02:46:57.774
WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION

02:46:57.841 --> 02:46:59.476
OF FORTY AFTER THE BUDGET IS

02:46:59.542 --> 02:47:01.745
ENACTED. SO BECAUSE OF THIS IT

02:47:01.811 --> 02:47:03.179
IS CURRENTLY UNCLEAR HOW THE

02:47:03.246 --> 02:47:04.614
FUNDING WOULD BE ALLOCATED AND

02:47:04.681 --> 02:47:06.216
USED AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO

02:47:06.282 --> 02:47:07.484
ASSESS WHETHER THE PROGRAMS

02:47:07.550 --> 02:47:10.253
WOULD ACTUALLY BE EFFECTIVE. SO

02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:11.888
FOR EXAMPLE WITH GUN BUYBACKS.

02:47:11.955 --> 02:47:13.623
THEY CAN BE TARGETED TO ADDRESS

02:47:13.690 --> 02:47:15.225
DIFFERENT PURPOSES SUCH AS TO

02:47:15.291 --> 02:47:17.026
REDUCE FIREARM SUICIDE OR TO

02:47:17.093 --> 02:47:18.762
REDUCE THE FIREARM CRIME RELATED

02:47:18.828 --> 02:47:21.464
VIOLENCE. SO IF THE GOAL IS TO

02:47:21.531 --> 02:47:22.866
REDUCE FIREARM CRIME RELATED

02:47:22.932 --> 02:47:24.367
VIOLENCE RESEARCH ACTUALLY

02:47:24.434 --> 02:47:26.269
SHOULDN'T SUGGESTS. THAT THESE

02:47:26.336 --> 02:47:27.170
TYPES OF PROGRAMS ARE MORE

02:47:27.237 --> 02:47:29.072
EFFECTIVE AT THEIR STRUCTURE IN

02:47:29.139 --> 02:47:31.141
PARTICULAR WAY. SUCH AS

02:47:31.207 --> 02:47:32.242
REQUIRING THAT FIREARMS BE

02:47:32.308 --> 02:47:34.077
WORKING. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE AN

02:47:34.144 --> 02:47:36.346
INCENTIVE PRIORITIZING THE TYPES

02:47:36.413 --> 02:47:37.680
OF FIREARMS THAT ARE GENERALLY

02:47:37.747 --> 02:47:40.049
USED IN CRIMES. AND OR FOCUSING

02:47:40.116 --> 02:47:41.751
ON THE TYPES OF INDIVIDUALS OR

02:47:41.818 --> 02:47:43.620
LOCATIONS THAT ARE MORE PRONE TO

02:47:43.686 --> 02:47:45.054
FIRE OF VIOLENCE. BUT AT THIS

02:47:45.121 --> 02:47:46.523
POINT IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER OR

02:47:46.589 --> 02:47:51.461
NOT THAT WOULD BE PART. OF- THIS

02:47:51.528 --> 02:47:52.829
PROPOSAL. MORE BROADLY WHEN THE

02:47:52.896 --> 02:47:54.531
LEGISLATURE THINKING THE ENTIRE

02:47:54.597 --> 02:47:56.466
SAFETY PACKAGE WE DO RECOMMEND

02:47:56.533 --> 02:47:57.634
THAT THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE

02:47:57.700 --> 02:47:59.602
ITS HIGHEST PRIORITY PUBLIC

02:47:59.669 --> 02:48:01.671
SAFETY GALS. SPECIFIED CLEAR

02:48:01.738 --> 02:48:02.872
OBJECTIVES TO ACHIEVE THOSE

02:48:02.939 --> 02:48:04.340
GOALS AND THEN PROVIDE THE

02:48:04.407 --> 02:48:05.475
FUNDING IN A MANNER THAT

02:48:05.542 --> 02:48:07.310
ACTUALLY ENSURES THAT THOSE

02:48:07.377 --> 02:48:08.178
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE

02:48:08.244 --> 02:48:09.679
ACHIEVED. SO IN TERMS OF

02:48:09.746 --> 02:48:11.047
THINKING ABOUT THOSE HIGHEST

02:48:11.114 --> 02:48:12.649
PRIORITY PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS

02:48:12.715 --> 02:48:13.817
THEY MAY OR MAY NOT INCLUDE

02:48:13.883 --> 02:48:16.319
FIREARMS. IF THE LEGISLATURE IS

02:48:16.386 --> 02:48:17.821
INTERESTED IN PRIORITIZING

02:48:17.887 --> 02:48:19.823
CERTAIN FIREARM RELATED POLLS.

02:48:19.889 --> 02:48:21.391
DATA DOES INDICATE THAT THERE

02:48:21.458 --> 02:48:23.126
HAS BEEN A GROWTH IN HOMICIDE

02:48:23.193 --> 02:48:24.994
FIREARM DEATHS AS WELL AS AN

02:48:25.061 --> 02:48:26.162
INCREASE IN THE SHARE OF

02:48:26.229 --> 02:48:27.997
HOMICIDES AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS

02:48:28.064 --> 02:48:29.999
AND ROBBERIES THAT INVOLVED

02:48:30.066 --> 02:48:32.101
FIREARMS. ADDITIONALLY AS OF

02:48:32.168 --> 02:48:34.471
JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THEY

02:48:34.537 --> 02:48:36.506
WERE NEARLY TWENTY THREE

02:48:36.573 --> 02:48:37.140
THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS

02:48:37.207 --> 02:48:38.074
ON THE STATE'S ARMED AND

02:48:38.141 --> 02:48:40.276
PROHIBITED PERSONS LAST- THIS

02:48:40.343 --> 02:48:41.311
COMMITTEE HAS HEARD OF THEM

02:48:41.377 --> 02:48:42.345
BEFORE THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:48:42.412 --> 02:48:44.180
SUBSEQUENTLY BECOME PROHIBITED

02:48:44.247 --> 02:48:46.449
FROM POSSESSING- FIREARMS OR

02:48:46.516 --> 02:48:47.750
AMMUNITION THAT THEY HAD LEGALLY

02:48:47.817 --> 02:48:49.152
PURCHASED AFTER THEY ARE

02:49:14.377 --> 02:49:15.912
PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE.

02:49:15.979 --> 02:49:17.313
THE FIRST ONE IS. THE
