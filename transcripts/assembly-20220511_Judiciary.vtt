TOGETHER. THIS IS REALLY BEEN

00:56:59.048 --> 00:57:00.450
WHAT I TERMINATE AT AN

00:57:00.517 --> 00:57:02.585
ENTRENCHED ISSUE EVERYBODY IN

00:57:02.652 --> 00:57:04.521
THEIR TRENCHES AND UNWILLING TO

00:57:04.587 --> 00:57:07.924
BUDGE AND YET. ANY LIMITATION ON

00:57:07.991 --> 00:57:09.425
THE ECONOMICS OF HOW THE LEGAL

00:57:09.492 --> 00:57:12.562
SYSTEM WORKS. AT SOME POINTS BY

00:57:12.629 --> 00:57:14.898
ITS NATURE BECOMES AN IMPEDIMENT

00:57:14.964 --> 00:57:16.232
TO ACCESS TO JUSTICE THAT IS

00:57:16.299 --> 00:57:19.936
REALLY WHAT THIS HAS BECOME OVER

00:57:20.003 --> 00:57:22.205
THE YEARS. SO IT THIS IS A

00:57:22.272 --> 00:57:23.973
HISTORIC MOMENT THIS IS A

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.943
SIGNIFICANT STEP IN RECOGNIZING

00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:30.914
. THEY THE STRENGTH OF

00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:33.817
LEGISLATION AND WITH THE

00:57:33.883 --> 00:57:35.151
LONGEVITY OR SOMETIMES A LACK OF

00:57:35.218 --> 00:57:39.222
LONGEVITY OF LEGISLATION IN HOW

00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:40.824
IT GETS IMPLEMENTED OVER TIME

00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:42.759
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY THIS IS A

00:57:42.826 --> 00:57:44.527
SIGNIFICANT SOLUTION NOT JUST

00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:45.995
BECAUSE IT IS FINALLY BRINGING

00:57:46.062 --> 00:57:47.397
TOGETHER WHAT HAD BEEN

00:57:47.463 --> 00:57:50.166
ENTRENCHED INTERESTS AND HAVING

00:57:50.233 --> 00:57:52.302
A CONVERSATION AND NOW OPENING

00:57:52.368 --> 00:57:53.970
UP ACCESS TO JUSTICE BUT IT'S A

00:57:54.037 --> 00:57:56.272
SOLUTION THAT THAT HAS A MUCH

00:57:56.339 --> 00:57:58.241
MUCH LONGER HORIZON TO BE ABLE

00:57:58.308 --> 00:57:59.442
TO BE EFFECTIVE IN TO BE

00:57:59.509 --> 00:58:01.010
UTILIZED AND I THINK THAT'S THE

00:58:01.077 --> 00:58:04.781
AT THE HEART. OF WHY THIS IS.

00:58:04.848 --> 00:58:05.615
REALLY SO IMPORTANT IT'S

00:58:05.682 --> 00:58:07.450
HISTORIC BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN ABLE

00:58:07.517 --> 00:58:09.185
TO KIND OF BREAK THE LOGJAM BUT

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:11.120
ALSO BECAUSE IT IS A VERY WELL

00:58:11.187 --> 00:58:13.923
CRAFTED THOUGHTFUL. SOLUTION

00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:17.460

ANYTHING THERE MAY VERY WELL BE

00:58:29.772 --> 00:58:31.007
CLEAN UP LANGUAGE THIS IS NOT A

00:58:31.074 --> 00:58:32.609
CONSENT ITEM BUT IT IS A

00:58:32.675 --> 00:58:33.543
CONCURRENCE ITEM WHICH MEANS WE

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:36.145
