TWO AND OTHER AGENCIES TO BRING HOME AWARENESS TO THIS LEGACY HOMES PROGRAM. IT ALLOWS FAMILIES TO DONATE HOME CONDO OR OTHER SUCH GLOWING. TO EXPERIENCE NONPROFIT. ORGANIZATION. WHOSE MISSION IS TO SERVE PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES. AND. IF YOU'RE A PARENT THAT SOMEBODY WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY. LET ME. HAS SEVERE DISABILITIES. YOU ARE ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR. FUTURE. YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. AND NOT HAVING OF HAVING. THAT WORRY ALWAYS ON YOUR MIND. I HAVING SOME PROGRAM WHERE YOU CAN DONATE IF YOU HAVE ASSETS THE ONLY US YOU MIGHT HAVE WOULD BE YOUR HOME. IT MIGHT BE THE ONLY THING YOU GOT. IT MIGHT BE THE ONE THING THAT WILL KEEP YOUR CHILD. IT'S HAVE A HAPPY LIFE ONCE YOU MOVE ON. AND PASS ON SO I THINK THIS RESOLUTION IS TO. LET PEOPLE LIKE MY FAMILY AND OTHERS THAT HAVE. FAMILY MEMBERS THEIR DEVELOPMENTAL. WOULD DEVELOP DISABILITIES TO HAVE. AN OPPORTUNITY AND SUPPORT. THESE GUYS A PROGRAM SO THAT'S THAT'S RESOLUTION I HOPE WE CAN. ALL PARTICIPATE IN OUR OWN WAY SUPPORTING AND PUBLICIZING. CALIFORNIA LEGACY HOMES PROGRAM THANK YOU. HELLO AND MY NAME IS PATTY UP LINGER AND I REPRESENT THE LETTERMAN HOUSING ALLIANCE WERE MADE UP OF WHERE NONPROFIT HOUSING ORGANIZATION MADE UP OF SEVERAL. HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WORK WITH PEOPLE FOR WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THIS BOOK HERE IS. PUT OUT BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPPORTED LITTON NETWORK AND IT HAS STORIES OF SEVERAL LUCKY PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LIVE IN THEIR OWN HOMES. AND WITH WITH SUPPORT AND THE LACK OF HOUSING I CAN'T SAY IT ENOUGH THERE'S A LACK OF HOUSING IN PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES MOST OF THEM OVER EIGHTY OR. EIGHTY PERCENT AT LEAST EIGHTY PERCENT ARE ON SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME NINE HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS A MONTH IF ANYONE'S CHECK RENTS LATELY OR THE HOUSING SITUATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S IT'S TREMENDOUS AND PEOPLE CANNOT LIVE IN THEIR OWN HOME UNLESS THEY HAVE SOME SORT OF SUBSIDY IN WE THIS PROGRAM HERE IS IT LEAVING A HOLE. IN IN PERPETUITY FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WHO A FAMILY THAT HAS A CHILD WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY THEY CAN DONATE THIS HOME TO A HOUSING ORGANIZATION NONPROFIT. THAT WILL KEEP THEIR HOME FOR THE CHILD AND PROVIDE THEIR SUPPORT ENOUGH THAT HOME IS NO LONGER APPROPRIATE FOR THE CHILD THEN THE MONEY CAN FOLLOW THE CHILDHOOD WHATEVER IS IMPORTANT SO WE HAVE A LACK OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. THIS MODEL IS GOING TO CREATE MORE HOUSING OPTIONS FOR OTHERS BECAUSE THAT ONE PERSON WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY MAY HAVE OTHERS WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY AS WELL TO LIVE IN THIS HOME. AND IT'S AN OPTION WHERE THEY CAN LIVE AFFORDABLY AND LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY AND I THINK THAT REGARDLESS OF THE DESIRES OF PEOPLE TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY IN ACCESS SAFE AND STABLE. LONG TERM HOUSING AFTER THEIR PARENTS ARE KNOWING NO LONGER ABLE TO CARE FOR HOME WITH THE CURRENT REAL ESTATE MARKET IT'S HARD TO FIND SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN AFFORD TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.
