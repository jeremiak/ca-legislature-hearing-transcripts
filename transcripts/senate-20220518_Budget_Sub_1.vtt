I'LL JUST REPEAT A COMMENT I

00:29:03.508 --> 00:29:05.110
MADE IN THE PREVIOUS HEARING

JUST TRYING TO PROTECT IT ALL

00:29:23.495 --> 00:29:24.896
THE WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS AND

00:29:24.963 --> 00:29:26.798
CALL IT A DAY. IN THIS

00:29:26.865 --> 00:29:29.634
CIRCUMSTANCE WE HAVE THE HIGHEST

00:29:29.701 --> 00:29:31.369
INFLATION WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF

00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:34.105
DECADES. AND WE HAVE SOME

00:29:34.172 --> 00:29:36.641
RESIDUAL COSTS OUT OF THE

00:29:36.708 --> 00:29:39.177
PANDEMIC. AND 5% DOES NOT KEEP

00:29:39.244 --> 00:29:41.813
PACE A SO FALLING BACK ON THE-

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.981
ON THE GENEROSITY OF

00:29:43.047 --> 00:29:45.583
PREDICTABILITY OF THE 5% IS GOOD

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:47.585
AND I RECOGNIZE THAT BUT IT DOES

00:29:47.652 --> 00:29:49.020
NOT KEEP PACE WITH WAS WHAT THE

00:29:49.087 --> 00:29:51.222
EXPENSES ARE. AND PARTICULARLY

00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:53.458
IN THE CASE OF CSU WHERETHEY

00:29:53.525 --> 00:29:55.760

REGARD TO COMPENSATION WILLBE

00:29:59.864 --> 00:30:02.400
VERY HARD TO DO WITHIN THE FIVE

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:05.603
PERCENT. IT IS ACTUALLY A

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:08.106
SOMETHING THAT IS THE REASON THE

00:30:08.173 --> 00:30:09.407
LEGISLATURE HAS HAS RECOMMENDED

00:30:09.474 --> 00:30:13.144
IT BUT THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION- I

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:15.079
WANTED TO MAKE HIS. MMHM IS TO

00:30:15.146 --> 00:30:16.648
TEASE OUT A LITTLE MORE THE

00:30:16.714 --> 00:30:18.650
ENFORCEABILITY OF THE CONTACTS

00:30:18.716 --> 00:30:20.718
BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED. THAT

00:30:20.785 --> 00:30:23.621
THERE'S A BUDGET LANGUAGE ON THE

00:30:23.688 --> 00:30:26.858
REPORTING. BUT IS THAT THE

00:30:26.925 --> 00:30:28.026
EXTENT OF THE ENFORCEABILITY OF

00:30:28.092 --> 00:30:31.863
THESE CONTACTS IF LET'S JUST SAY

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:33.765
AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS

00:30:33.831 --> 00:30:35.667
THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON ONE OF

00:30:35.733 --> 00:30:37.902
THE SEGMENTS DOES NOT FULFILL

00:30:37.969 --> 00:30:39.971
SOME OF THE DIRECTIONS THAT ARE

00:30:40.038 --> 00:30:42.974
CLEARLY OUTLINED IN THE COMPACT

00:30:43.041 --> 00:30:44.542
. HE ISSUE WHAT IS THE

00:30:44.609 --> 00:30:46.744
ENFORCEABILITY THEY REPORT THAT

00:30:46.811 --> 00:30:48.413
THEY HAVEN'T MET THE THINGS THAT

00:30:48.479 --> 00:30:50.048
HAVE SET OUT WHAT ARE THE

00:30:50.114 --> 00:30:52.717
OPTIONS TO ENFORCE THAT AND ARE

00:30:52.784 --> 00:30:55.620
IN FACT THE FUTURE 5% INCREASES

00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:57.889
AT RISK FOR ANYTHING THAT MIGHT

00:30:57.956 --> 00:30:59.857
COME OUT OF THEM. BEING UNABLE

00:30:59.924 --> 00:31:02.026

GUESS I SHOULD SAY FIRSTLY THAT

00:31:10.335 --> 00:31:11.469
THE COMPLEX AND THE ROADMAP

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:13.304
ARTICULATE SHARED VISIONS AND

00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:16.140

ACCOUNTABILITY YOU KNOW ONE

00:31:28.853 --> 00:31:32.056
WHERE WHERE VERY HOPEFUL THAT.

00:31:32.123 --> 00:31:32.991
THERE WILL BE CONSIDERABLE

IT MORE FROM A HOLISTIC GOOD

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:08.926
FAITH EFFORT. TYPE OF APPROACH

00:32:08.993 --> 00:32:10.061
THIRTY REPORTING THAT'S

00:32:10.128 --> 00:32:11.696
ARTICULATED AND THE SPECIFIC

00:32:11.763 --> 00:32:18.436
METRICS THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE. THE DETAIL COMPACT DOCUMENTS.

00:32:18.503 --> 00:32:20.238
WHY NOT NECESSARILY EXPECT ANY

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:21.039
YEAR THAT THEY'RE EXACTLY A 100%

00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:23.474

PROGRESS GOOD FAITH EFFORT.

00:32:31.516 --> 00:32:32.750
DEMONSTRATING THAT THEY HAVE

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:35.320
BEEN ABLE TO FORWARD ON THSE

00:32:35.386 --> 00:32:36.888
GOALS THAT THERE IS. A TRUE

00:32:36.954 --> 00:32:39.057
EFFORT BEING MADE TO IMPROVE%

00:32:39.123 --> 00:32:39.991
UPON THOSE CALLS AND HIT THOSE

00:32:40.058 --> 00:32:42.093
TARGETS. WERE RECOGNIZING THAT

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.928
IN SOME YEARS YOU KNOW THERE MAY

00:32:43.995 --> 00:32:45.596
BE CERTAIN AREAS THAT FALL A

00:32:45.663 --> 00:32:46.798
LITTLE BIT SHORT AND THERE MAY

00:32:46.864 --> 00:32:48.466
BE OTHER AREAS IN WHICH THEY'VE

00:32:48.533 --> 00:32:49.967
GONE. BEYOND EXPECTATIONS FOR

00:32:50.034 --> 00:32:51.769
THAT POINT IN TIME WE WOULD BE

00:32:51.836 --> 00:32:53.971
CONSIDERING ALL OF THOSE THINGS

00:32:54.038 --> 00:32:55.640
MORE HOLISTICALLY WHEN IT COMES

00:32:55.707 --> 00:32:58.810
TO ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET

00:32:58.876 --> 00:33:01.979
PROPOSALS FOR THE SEGMENT- MAYBE

00:33:02.046 --> 00:33:03.948
A THE APPRECIATE THAT BUT LET ME

00:33:04.015 --> 00:33:05.249
TRY THE QUESTION A SLIGHTLY

00:33:05.316 --> 00:33:07.719
DIFFERENT WAY LET'S SAY THAT

00:33:07.785 --> 00:33:08.519
WHEN THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:33:08.586 --> 00:33:10.355
CALIFORNIA'S BREASTS ARE REAL

00:33:10.421 --> 00:33:11.756
CONCERNS OVER INFLATION OVER

00:33:11.823 --> 00:33:13.825
NUMBER OF YEARS AND WANTING TO

00:33:13.891 --> 00:33:16.828
HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT. IF

00:33:16.894 --> 00:33:19.030
THE INFLATION MEANT THAT THEY

00:33:19.097 --> 00:33:21.099
WEREN'T MOVING AHEAD DIDN'T REAL

00:33:21.165 --> 00:33:25.336
DOLLARS- YOU WITH A 5% INCREASE

00:33:25.403 --> 00:33:27.171
AND THEN THEY COULDN'T ACHIEVE

00:33:27.238 --> 00:33:29.340
PART OF THE COMPACTS IS THAT

00:33:29.407 --> 00:33:31.509
SOMETHING THAT HERE BECAUSE YOU

00:33:31.576 --> 00:33:33.511
SAID IT SHARED A SHARED

00:33:33.578 --> 00:33:35.146
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOMETHING

00:33:35.213 --> 00:33:37.515
THAT YOU WOULD SORT OF ACCEPT AS

00:33:37.582 --> 00:33:40.418
A REASON WHY THEY WEREN'T

00:33:40.485 --> 00:33:44.188
MEETING PIECES OF THE COMPACT.

00:33:44.255 --> 00:33:45.456
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE

00:33:45.523 --> 00:33:47.525
WOULD HAVE TO DISCUSS FURTHER

00:33:47.592 --> 00:33:48.693
AND SEE WHERE THEY HAD BEEN ABLE

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.428
TO MAKE PROGRESS I THINK A

00:33:50.495 --> 00:33:51.863
NUMBER OF THE GOALS AND

00:33:51.929 --> 00:33:53.464
COMMITMENTS. YEAH DO REQUIRE

00:33:53.531 --> 00:33:54.132
ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT OF

00:33:54.198 --> 00:33:57.235
RESOURCES BUT A NUMBER CAN ALSO

00:33:57.301 --> 00:33:58.436
BE ACHIEVED. JUST STRATEGICALLY

00:33:58.503 --> 00:34:00.805
WITH WITHIN A LOT OF THE THINGS

00:34:00.872 --> 00:34:01.739
THAT THE SEGMENTS ARE YOU DOING

00:34:01.806 --> 00:34:03.808
IN WITHIN THEIR BASE AVAILABLE

00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:05.476
RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE TO SO.

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:07.812
I EACH CONTACT AND THE ROAD MAP

00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:09.614
DOCUMENT BUILD UPON THE

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.682
INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS GOALS THAT

00:34:11.749 --> 00:34:13.584
THEY ALREADY HAD AND THAT THEY

00:34:13.651 --> 00:34:15.386
WERE ALREADY MAKING SOME

00:34:15.453 --> 00:34:16.954
PROGRESS ON. THE FOR YOU SEE THE

00:34:17.021 --> 00:34:18.456
UC TWENTY THIRTY PLAN THE CSU

00:34:18.523 --> 00:34:20.124
GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY

00:34:20.191 --> 00:34:22.059
TWENTY FIVE. AND FOR THE CCC IS

00:34:22.126 --> 00:34:23.861
THE VISION FOR SUCCESS FOR EACH

00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:26.230
SEGMENT WAS WORKING AND HAD

00:34:26.297 --> 00:34:27.932
EFFORTS UNDER WAY AND GOALS

00:34:27.999 --> 00:34:29.901
ARTICULATED FOR IMPROVING A

00:34:29.967 --> 00:34:31.602
NUMBER OF THESE AREAS. THE

00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:33.738
CONTACTS IN THE ROAD MAP FOR THE

00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:36.040
BUILD UPON THOSE PLANS. BUT WE

00:34:36.107 --> 00:34:37.508
DO EXPECT THAT THE SEGMENTS

00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:39.877
WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE PROGRESS

00:34:39.944 --> 00:34:41.479
WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES AND

00:34:41.546 --> 00:34:44.982
MANY OF THESE AREAS THAT THEY'REALREADY TAKING STEPS TO TRY TO

00:34:45.049 --> 00:34:45.516
DO SO. AND THAT THE PLAN

00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:47.084
INVESTMENTS WOULD FACILITATE

00:34:47.151 --> 00:34:48.820
THEIR ABILITY TO DO THAT AS WELL

00:34:48.886 --> 00:34:50.655
AS- I DO SOME THINGS THAT OF

00:34:50.721 --> 00:34:51.956
COURSE YOU REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

00:34:52.023 --> 00:34:53.491
ONGOING RESOURCE THAT SEXUAL

00:34:53.558 --> 00:34:58.729
SEVERAL MACROS AT UC AND CSU.

SEGMENTS AND- AND THERE'S BEEN

00:35:17.315 --> 00:35:18.516
SOME OVERLAP AND MAYBE THAT'LL

00:35:18.583 --> 00:35:21.219
SHORTEN THE- THE- THE NEXT

00:35:21.285 --> 00:35:23.054

BEING AT THE END OF THIS YEAR- I

00:35:53.584 --> 00:35:55.019
DO KNOW FIVE PERCENT. BASE

00:35:55.086 --> 00:35:56.921
INCREASE SOUNDS GREAT IT IS

00:35:56.988 --> 00:35:57.989
HISTORICALLY HIGH IN RECENT

00:35:58.055 --> 00:35:59.891
YEARS- BUT WE'VE ALSO BEEN

00:35:59.957 --> 00:36:01.325
DEALING WITH THE CENTURY A ZERO

AS A REAL VALUE- A 5% INCREASE

00:36:10.401 --> 00:36:13.037
LOOKS LIKE A NEGATIVE. I'M IT IS

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:15.172
A DECREASE NOT INCREASE. I WANT

00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:16.774

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:01.646
THAT THERE IS- INFLATION

00:38:01.712 --> 00:38:02.546
CURRENTLY THAT THERE ARE SOME

00:38:02.613 --> 00:38:05.549
VOLATILITY. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE A

00:38:05.616 --> 00:38:07.885
LOT OF CONSTRAINTS WHEN IT COMES

00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:09.320
TO ADDITIONAL ONGOING SPENDING.

00:38:09.387 --> 00:38:11.489
AND MANY OF THOSE VALLEY- SPEAK

00:38:11.555 --> 00:38:13.457
SPOKE TO AT THE BEGINNING OF

00:38:13.524 --> 00:38:15.026
THIS HEARING AS WELL. AND JUST

00:38:15.092 --> 00:38:16.794
WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE OVERALL

00:38:16.861 --> 00:38:19.497
NEED FOR FISCAL PRUDENCE WHEN IT

00:38:19.563 --> 00:38:21.599
COMES TO. ADDITIONAL ONGOING

00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:22.967
SPENDING BECAUSE OF COURSE KIND

00:38:23.034 --> 00:38:24.568
OF THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS.

00:38:24.635 --> 00:38:26.337
COMMITMENTS OF ONGOING SPENDING

00:38:26.404 --> 00:38:28.406
THAT CAN BE FOLLOWED THROUGH

00:38:28.472 --> 00:38:30.541
UPON IN FUTURE HERE IF WE FIND

00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:31.776
OURSELVES IN THE EVENT OF A

00:38:31.842 --> 00:38:33.444
RECESSION- IT'S A MUCH MORE

00:38:33.511 --> 00:38:35.746
BETTER- IT'S A MUCH BETTER

00:38:35.813 --> 00:38:37.214
SITUATION. WHEN EVENTUAL

00:38:37.281 --> 00:38:39.350
EVENTUAL RECESSION HITS THAT WE

00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:40.785
JUST AREN'T ABLE TO IT IT

00:38:40.851 --> 00:38:42.853
ADDRESS OR INVEST ADDITIONAL ONE

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.955
TIMERESOURCES AT THAT POINT IN

00:38:45.022 --> 00:38:46.023
TIME. AS OPPOSED TO HAVING TO

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:47.925
MAKE CUTS WHICH IS. AT THE

00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:49.060
SITUATION WE FIND OURSELVES AND

00:38:49.126 --> 00:38:50.861
IF PREVIOUS COMMITMENTS OF I'M

00:38:50.928 --> 00:38:54.031
GOING SPENDING ARE. ARE HIGHER

00:38:54.098 --> 00:38:54.598
THAN WHAT WE CAN ACCOMMODATE

00:38:54.665 --> 00:38:56.167
THAT DOWN HERE. I GUESS MAYBE

00:38:56.233 --> 00:38:57.902
POSSIBLY I CAN APPRECIATE YOUR

00:38:57.968 --> 00:39:03.307
COMMENTS ABOUT RECESSION. RISK-

00:39:03.374 --> 00:39:04.542
AND DO YOU THINK THE- YOU

00:39:04.608 --> 00:39:05.476
PERCENT IS A SUFFICIENT GIVEN

00:39:05.543 --> 00:39:07.311
THAT WE DO EXPERIENCE EIGHT AND

00:39:07.378 --> 00:39:08.679
A HALF PERCENT. I IN THE YEAR

00:39:08.746 --> 00:39:11.082
ENDING MARCH TWENTY EIGHT POINT

00:39:11.148 --> 00:39:13.250
TWO- IN DEBT I THINK THAT THE

00:39:13.317 --> 00:39:15.119
PARTNER LABOR'S PREDICTING SIX

00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:16.987
AND A HALF PERCENT INFLATION BY.

00:39:17.054 --> 00:39:19.356
YOU FOR YEAR YEAR AND TWENTY

00:39:19.423 --> 00:39:25.329
TWENTY TWO. IS 5% SUFFICIENT. WE

00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:28.232
JUST EMPHASIZE THAT THAT THE 5%

00:39:28.299 --> 00:39:29.200
YEAR OVER YEAR BASIS INCREASES

00:39:29.266 --> 00:39:31.368
ARE. AMONG THE STRONGEST OF THE

00:39:31.435 --> 00:39:33.037
SEGMENTS HAVE SEEN PARTICULARLY

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:36.140
IN RECENT YEARS- AND THEN AGAIN

00:39:36.207 --> 00:39:38.142
AS MENTIONED AND WE'D BE LOOKING

00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:39.610
AT MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS

00:39:39.677 --> 00:39:41.312
IN NEW ONGOING FUNDING AT THE

00:39:41.378 --> 00:39:42.913
END OF THE FIVE YEAR TERM. IN

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.482
THE AGGREGATE FOR BOTH UC AND

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:46.350
CSU THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT

00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:48.686
INVESTMENTS IN THERE AMONG. THE

00:39:48.753 --> 00:39:51.122
TOP THREE OR FOUR PROBABLY

00:39:51.188 --> 00:39:53.190
INVESTMENTS OF ONGOING NON

00:39:53.257 --> 00:39:54.892
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL

00:39:54.959 --> 00:39:57.995
FUND THAT ARE PLANNED IN THE

00:39:58.062 --> 00:39:58.529
FACT THAT OVERALL IN THE

00:39:58.596 --> 00:39:59.130
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. AND

00:39:59.196 --> 00:40:00.364
AGAIN I WOULD RE ARTICULATE THAT

00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:02.233
THAT IS NOMINAL INCREASE BUT NOT

00:40:02.299 --> 00:40:04.101
REAL INCREASE AND SO I'M BILLION

00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:06.070
SOUNDS GREAT BUT IF THE COSTS-

00:40:06.137 --> 00:40:08.139
THAT UC'S INCURRING GO UP TO

00:40:08.205 --> 00:40:09.774
BILLION OR THREE BILLION. I WILL

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.742
NOT KEEPING PACE WITH INFLATION

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:12.843
THEN IT CAN IT'S A NET DECREASE

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:15.880
AND SO I WOULD JUST REITERATE

00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:16.747
THAT. MY SECOND QUESTION GOES

00:40:16.814 --> 00:40:18.949
TO. SET A COMMONS GOES TO THE

00:40:19.016 --> 00:40:20.785
POINT THAT CENTER LATER RAISED

00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:23.187
ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY- WELL IT

00:40:23.254 --> 00:40:24.789

HOPEFUL AND THE MINISTRATIONS

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.792
HOPEFUL. AND WE'RE GONNA BE

00:40:27.858 --> 00:40:29.426
GAUGING THINGS ON A HOLISTIC

00:40:29.493 --> 00:40:31.395
GOOD FAITH EFFORT- THAT THAT

00:40:31.462 --> 00:40:33.831
KIND OF SMACKS TO ME OF I CAN'T

00:40:33.898 --> 00:40:35.900
A VERY HANDS OFF APPROACH AND I

00:40:35.966 --> 00:40:36.934
GUESS THE QUESTION IS ARE YOU

00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:37.935
ANTICIPATING THAT THE

00:40:38.002 --> 00:40:39.303
LEGISLATURE WILL BE PRIMARILY

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:41.639

IN AND JUST TO DOUBLE DOWN ON

00:40:48.078 --> 00:40:48.879
WHAT CENTER WHERE TO ASK WHAT

JUST LEAVING THAT TO US OVERSEE

00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:08.666
. YEAH CERTAINLY EXPECT THAT

00:41:08.732 --> 00:41:10.634
THE- GIVEN THAT THE CONTACTS ON

00:41:10.701 --> 00:41:12.369
THE ROADMAP RECOMMENDS BETWEEN

00:41:12.436 --> 00:41:14.171
GET MINISTRATION EACH RESPECTIVE

00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:17.474
SEGMENT. WE WOULD BE DEFINITELY

PARTNERSHIP WITH EACH SEGMENT AS

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:22.546
THEY WORK TOWARD THOSE GOALS AND

00:41:22.613 --> 00:41:24.481
OBJECTIVES. LOOKING AT THE

YEAR TERM GOALS. AND BEYOND IN

00:41:41.198 --> 00:41:43.267
SOME CASES SO- WE WOULD

00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:45.636
CERTAINLY BE EXPECTING TO

00:41:45.703 --> 00:41:47.271
CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS

00:41:47.338 --> 00:41:49.506

APPROACH HERE IS NOT USUALLY

00:42:02.253 --> 00:42:04.355
DISSIMILAR FROM COMPACTS THAT

00:42:04.421 --> 00:42:05.823

AS THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING

COLLEGES WITH THOSE HIGHER COSTS

00:52:31.581 --> 00:52:33.016
BUT ALSO WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT

00:52:33.083 --> 00:52:34.584
OF FUNDING MORE DISTRICTS BASED

00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:36.753
ON THE FORMULA RATHER THAN

COLLEGES. TO USE THE MONEY TO

00:53:14.457 --> 00:53:16.626
ADDRESS LOCAL NEEDS. ALTHOUGH WE

00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:18.762

00:53:18.828 --> 00:53:20.897
AS YOU BUILD THE PROPOSITION

00:53:20.964 --> 00:53:22.032

COMMENTS AND SOME OF THE TOPICS

00:53:52.963 --> 00:53:55.231
THAT HAVEN'T BEEN COVERED- HE

00:53:55.298 --> 00:53:57.601
MET WITH THE- GOVERNOR'S

00:53:57.667 --> 00:54:00.036
PROPOSAL AND THAT. ALLEY OWES

00:54:00.103 --> 00:54:02.072
OBSERVATION THAT INVESTMENT IN

INCREASES IS A LAUDABLE APPROACH

00:54:09.946 --> 00:54:12.315
IT ALLOWS DISTRICTS TO CONTINUE

00:54:12.382 --> 00:54:15.285
THEIR FOCUS ON ACCESS ACTUALLY

00:54:15.352 --> 00:54:26.096
INTO. I TURNED MY MIKE. WELL YOU

00:54:26.162 --> 00:54:34.270

BALL A- THOSE SIDE BAR SHOULD

00:54:36.573 --> 00:54:40.577
NOT TUMBLE OUT OF MY MOUTH. WE

00:54:40.644 --> 00:54:43.413
THINK IT'S A PRUDENT APPROACH TO

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:46.416
INVEST IN BASE RESOURCES AND-

00:54:46.483 --> 00:54:48.318

EQUITY AND SUCCESS. AND NEEDING

00:54:54.658 --> 00:54:56.192
SOME OF THESE GOALS AND THE ROAD

00:54:56.259 --> 00:54:57.694
MAP AND THAT WAS THAT ABOUT

ONE TIME INVESTMENTS- WE'RE GLAD

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.342
TO SEE THAT THERE'S A COMMITMENT

00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:14.711
TO PAY DOWN- THE DEFERRED

00:55:14.778 --> 00:55:16.880

NINE BARRING NO MAJOR COST

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:25.088
ESCALATION ISSUES I'M SO

00:55:25.155 --> 00:55:27.791
INVESTING NOW- IN THAT AREA

00:55:27.857 --> 00:55:30.860
REALLY MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. I

00:55:30.927 --> 00:55:33.063
AND WE'RE ALSO GLAD TO SEE THAT

00:55:33.129 --> 00:55:34.631
THERE ARE STILL A COMMITMENT FOR

00:55:34.698 --> 00:55:36.566
TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION AND

00:55:36.633 --> 00:55:39.269
SECURITY AS IT IS A MAJOR RISK

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:40.837
THAT'S ON DISTRICTS STILL HAVE

00:55:40.904 --> 00:55:43.940
TO FACE- AS THEY ARE NOW HOLDING

00:55:44.007 --> 00:55:46.009
A LOT MORE STUDENT DATA THE

00:55:46.076 --> 00:55:48.678

INVESTMENTS IN ACADEMIC PATHWAYS

00:56:01.524 --> 00:56:03.059

MADE THROUGH LEGISLATION OR IN

00:56:09.165 --> 00:56:11.601
PRIOR BUDGETS AND THEY JUST HOPE

00:56:11.668 --> 00:56:13.236
DISTRICTS ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE

00:56:13.303 --> 00:56:16.072

REITERATE ENOUGH HOW POWERFUL

00:56:29.619 --> 00:56:31.488
THOSE INVESTMENTS WOULD BE ON

00:56:31.554 --> 00:56:33.022
DECK RIGHT NOW IN ADDRESSING

00:56:33.089 --> 00:56:35.058

LET ME. BEGIN BY ASKING OF. OUR

00:56:46.302 --> 00:56:48.204
QUEST OF THE DAY OF FINANCE IN

00:56:48.271 --> 00:56:49.672
AND ONE IS. ARM WE SHOW THAT

00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:51.875
DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS WERE MORE

00:56:51.941 --> 00:56:54.110
IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. ARE

00:56:54.177 --> 00:56:57.447
RELATIVELY AND HOW WOULD THEY

00:56:57.514 --> 00:56:59.649
BENEFIT FROM THE EXTRADOLLARS

00:56:59.716 --> 00:57:02.285
THAT ARE PROPOSED HERE FOR

00:57:02.352 --> 00:57:03.319
COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THIS

00:57:03.386 --> 00:57:07.056
BUDGET. I'M STANDARD ACCORDING

00:57:07.123 --> 00:57:08.858
TO FINANCE SO I WOULD NOTE THAT

00:57:08.925 --> 00:57:10.627
YES A LOT OF THE DOLLARS IN THIS

00:57:10.693 --> 00:57:12.295
BUDGET ARE PROPOSED TO BE

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:13.863
FLEXIBLE- WHICH ALLOW COLLEGES

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:15.865
TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF THE

00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:17.901
LOCAL POPULATION SO- MEDICAID

00:57:17.967 --> 00:57:19.469
OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE THAT

00:57:19.536 --> 00:57:21.571
THIS THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE

00:57:21.638 --> 00:57:22.839
MILLION INCREASE TO THE BASE. AS

00:57:22.906 --> 00:57:24.274
WELL AS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:25.542
MILLION DOLLAR BLOCK GRANT WOULD

00:57:25.608 --> 00:57:26.576
PROVIDE DISTRICTS WITH THE

00:57:26.643 --> 00:57:27.844
RESOURCES THEY NEED TO BEST FOR

00:57:27.911 --> 00:57:30.146
THEIR STUDENT POPULATIONS-

00:57:30.213 --> 00:57:32.482
ESPECIALLY THE UNDERSERVED. OR-

00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:35.552
UNDIRECTED. BY THE- THEY WOULD

00:57:35.618 --> 00:57:37.620
ALSO NOT THE TWO HUNDRED AND

00:57:37.687 --> 00:57:38.655
FIFTY MILLION THAT WERE PLAYING

00:57:38.721 --> 00:57:39.889
SPECIFICALLY TOWARDS INCREASING

00:57:39.956 --> 00:57:40.523
THE RATES THE STUDENT CENTERED

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:41.524
FUNDING FORMULA. IS BEING

00:57:41.591 --> 00:57:42.892
ANOTHER INVESTMENT THAT'S GEARED

00:57:42.959 --> 00:57:44.260
TOWARDS ENSURING THAT DISTRICTS

00:57:44.327 --> 00:57:46.162
ARE. PROVIDED A STRONG INCENTIVE

00:57:46.229 --> 00:57:49.566
TOWARDS AND- INCREASING. BOTH

00:57:49.632 --> 00:57:53.036
THE AMOUNT OF ACCESS AND THE-

00:57:53.102 --> 00:57:53.536
CERTIFICATE AND DEGREE

00:57:53.603 --> 00:57:56.239
COMPLETION- OF ALL THEIR

00:57:56.306 --> 00:57:57.774
STUDENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT

00:57:57.841 --> 00:58:00.009
ARE DIFFERENT I THINK IT'S STILL

00:58:00.076 --> 00:58:01.644
AN OPEN QUESTION AND I THINK

00:58:01.711 --> 00:58:03.646
IT'S SOMETHING WE WANT TO TALK

00:58:03.713 --> 00:58:05.048
ABOUT THIS WEEK. A NEGOTIATE THE

00:58:05.114 --> 00:58:07.483
BUDGET AND MOVE FORWARD I ALSO

00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:11.821
JUST AS A COMMENT WOULD SAY- I

00:58:11.888 --> 00:58:14.858
JUST STILL THINK WRONG GRATEFUL

00:58:14.924 --> 00:58:16.526
FOR SORT OF THE TWO YEARS ON THE

00:58:16.593 --> 00:58:17.727
STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING

00:58:17.794 --> 00:58:21.798
FORMULA. THE WHOLE- FACTOR OF

00:58:21.865 --> 00:58:25.001
OUR COST OF LIVING- ISN'T NEVER

00:58:25.068 --> 00:58:26.336
GOT ADDRESSED AND ISN'T FACTORED

00:58:26.402 --> 00:58:28.404
INTO THIS AND I THINK THERE ARE

00:58:28.471 --> 00:58:29.739
SOME THINGS AROUND A STUDENT

00:58:29.806 --> 00:58:31.474
CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA WE'RE

00:58:31.541 --> 00:58:33.076
STILL GOING TO WANT TO TALK

00:58:33.142 --> 00:58:34.611
ABOUT. AND THEN TWO QUESTIONS

00:58:34.677 --> 00:58:37.347
BOTH THE FINANCE. ARM IT WAS

00:58:37.413 --> 00:58:39.182

00:58:39.249 --> 00:58:42.919
PROGRAM FOR FOSTER KIDS- THE

00:58:42.986 --> 00:58:45.388
MINISTRATION AS HAS RECOMMENDED

00:58:45.455 --> 00:58:47.056
DOUBLING THE AMOUNT TO TWENTY

00:58:47.123 --> 00:58:49.025
MILLION AND US SENATE'S PROPOSAL

00:58:49.092 --> 00:58:51.060
WOULD DOUBLE THAT. AGAIN BUT

00:58:51.127 --> 00:58:55.365
THEIR EXISTENCE CAP TO LIMITED

00:58:55.431 --> 00:58:58.101
TO TEN CAMPUSES AND SO. IF THE

00:58:58.167 --> 00:59:00.169
MONEY IS BEING INCREASED I

00:59:00.236 --> 00:59:01.871
WONDERED IF THE ADMINISTRATION

00:59:01.938 --> 00:59:06.709
AND ITS PROPOSAL IS. ALSO

00:59:06.776 --> 00:59:08.278
ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF THE CAP

00:59:08.344 --> 00:59:10.546
. THANK YOU. AGAIN DAN ORDER

00:59:10.613 --> 00:59:12.548
FROM THE FINANCE YES TO THE CAP

00:59:12.615 --> 00:59:13.783
IS REMOVED AS PART OF THIS- AND

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:15.351
AS WELL ALLOWS FOR BROWN

00:59:15.418 --> 00:59:16.386
OCCASION SPECIFICALLY TWO

00:59:16.452 --> 00:59:18.488
CAMPUSES BUT HE GETS TO USE THE

00:59:18.554 --> 00:59:20.189
DISTRICTS OFFER FUNDING BUT THEN

00:59:20.256 --> 00:59:21.257
ALLOWS- ALLOCATIONS TO BE BASED

00:59:21.324 --> 00:59:22.725
OFF ON THE CONSTABLE. I THINK

00:59:22.792 --> 00:59:24.427
THAT WAS SOMETHING TO BE HEARD

00:59:24.494 --> 00:59:26.396
FROM THE FIELD AS AS WELL AS-

00:59:26.462 --> 00:59:28.331
FROM FROM SENATE HEARINGS AND

00:59:28.398 --> 00:59:29.766
GOOD HOWEVER I WAS HOPING WE

00:59:29.832 --> 00:59:31.367
WERE DEFINED AS THE FIELD AND

00:59:31.434 --> 00:59:32.702
THAT OUR KIDS I KNEW YOU'D HEARD

00:59:32.769 --> 00:59:35.038
IT FROM US SO THANK YOU I

00:59:35.104 --> 00:59:39.108
APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER. AND THEN

00:59:39.175 --> 00:59:39.909
MY LAST QUESTION. IS ARM DID

00:59:39.976 --> 00:59:41.010
MINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED TWO

00:59:41.077 --> 00:59:42.779
HUNDRED. MILLION DOLLARS FOR

00:59:42.845 --> 00:59:44.914
PART TIME FACULTY OF HEALTH

00:59:44.981 --> 00:59:46.549
BENEFITS AND I DIDN'T SEE ANY

00:59:46.616 --> 00:59:48.584
DETAIL FOR HOW THAT'S GOING IS

00:59:48.651 --> 00:59:50.553
THERE DETAIL FOR WHAT'S ATTACHED

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:55.258
TO THAT AMOUNT IN THE MAY REVISE

00:59:55.325 --> 00:59:56.793
. A SURGEON THAT THAT FUNDING IS

00:59:56.859 --> 00:59:59.128
GONNA BE IS PROPOSED TO BE USED

00:59:59.195 --> 01:00:00.797
THE CURRENT- PART TIME FACULTY

01:00:00.863 --> 01:00:02.465
HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM

01:00:02.532 --> 01:00:04.467
METHODOLOGY THAT THAT EXISTS- I

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:06.035
THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:08.137
WE RAN INTO AS WE ARE DEVELOPING

01:00:08.204 --> 01:00:08.771
A MARRIAGE WHERE WE'RE THINKING

01:00:08.838 --> 01:00:10.540
THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL. IS A LACK

01:00:10.606 --> 01:00:12.575
OF ACCESS TO DATA A CLEAR

01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:14.610
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE PART

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:15.611
TIME FACULTY HEALTH INSURANCE

01:00:15.678 --> 01:00:17.680
LANDSCAPE IS- ACROSS THE

01:00:17.747 --> 01:00:19.482
DISTRICT AND ACROSS THE STATE.

01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:21.551
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS

01:00:21.617 --> 01:00:23.586
INCLUDED AS PART OF THEIR VISION

01:00:23.653 --> 01:00:24.754
THIS IS ATTACHED TO THIS-

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:25.922
DISCRETIONARY BLOCK GRANT

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:27.657
FUNDING- IS REPORTING LANGUAGE

01:00:27.724 --> 01:00:30.093
SO WE WOULD BE COLLECTING

01:00:30.159 --> 01:00:30.927
INFORMATION FROM DISTRICTS FROM

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:32.795
THE PROVISION OF HEALTH

01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:34.297
INSURANCE THE PART TIME FACULTY.

01:00:34.364 --> 01:00:35.631
AND SOME OTHER INFORMATION

01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:37.934
RELATED TO THAT SO WE CAN HAVE A

01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:40.269
BETTER SENSE OF WHAT IT IS THAT

01:00:40.336 --> 01:00:40.937
FOR LOOKING OUT WE- THINK

01:00:41.004 --> 01:00:42.905
THROUGH WHETHER THERE NEEDS TO

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:43.573
BE MODIFICATIONS TO EXISTING

01:00:43.639 --> 01:00:44.941
PART TIME FACULTY HEALTH

01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:46.576
INSURANCE PROGRAM- METHODOLOGY I

01:00:46.642 --> 01:00:48.144
WOULD JUST OBSERVE THAT THAT

01:00:48.211 --> 01:00:49.679
SORT OF CHICKEN AND THE EGG

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:50.913
BECAUSE OF IT TURNS OUT IT'S NOT

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:52.749
WORKING WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH A

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:54.417
YEAR. AND HAVE THEM REPORT THAT

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:56.319
IT'S NOT WORKING AND WE MIGHT BE

01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:58.588
ABLE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT

01:00:58.654 --> 01:00:59.856
BEFORE WE- APPROPRIATE THE MONEY

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:01.491
AND THERE WERE SOME ISSUES THAT

01:01:01.557 --> 01:01:04.961
WE RAISED. OUR ABOUT SPECIFICITY

01:01:05.028 --> 01:01:09.432
WHEN THIS WENT BIAS IN FEBRUARY

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:10.666
AND A COUPLE OF THE MORE- FOR.

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:13.236
EXAMPLE THERE'S A MATCH THAT

01:01:13.302 --> 01:01:15.571
EXISTS. FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:01:15.638 --> 01:01:17.640
AND YET THE R. GATHERED THAT

01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:19.809
DOES THE AMOUNT IT'S PROPOSED

01:01:19.876 --> 01:01:21.611
HERE. WE WOULD COVER THE

01:01:21.677 --> 01:01:23.112
BENEFITS AND WOULD REQUIRE THE

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:24.614
MANSION AND YOU HAVE SOME BAD

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:27.884
JOKES THAT. ARE WORK AT TWO OR

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:29.652
THREE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES AND YET

01:01:29.719 --> 01:01:31.521
ARE ONLY COUNTED FOR WHATEVER

01:01:31.587 --> 01:01:33.623
THEY DO ONE CAMPUS AND ONCE

01:01:33.689 --> 01:01:35.258
AGAIN OUR SORT OF SCREENED OUT

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:37.627
FROM THE ABILITY TO DO THIS. AND

01:01:37.693 --> 01:01:41.197
I THINK THAT THE AND THEN THE

01:01:41.264 --> 01:01:42.965
OTHER QUESTION WAS THAT I DON'T

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:45.535
THINK IT'S BEEN ADDRESSED IS

01:01:45.601 --> 01:01:47.670
MORE INTERESTED IN WHAT THE OUT

01:01:47.737 --> 01:01:48.738
YOUR COSTS ARE AND WERE

01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:49.639
INTERESTED ON WHETHER OR NOT

01:01:49.705 --> 01:01:51.140
THIS AMOUNT ACTUALLY ADDRESSES

01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:54.710
THE ISSUE AND SO I JUST HOPE.

01:01:54.777 --> 01:01:56.479
SINCE WE HAVE FOUR WEEKS TO LAND

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.347
THE PLANE ON THE BUDGET THATWE

01:01:58.414 --> 01:01:59.549
CAN GET INTO SOME OF THOSE

01:01:59.615 --> 01:02:01.651
DETAILS AND DRILL DOWN ON THEM

01:02:01.717 --> 01:02:03.453
AND REFINE THEM AND GET SOME

01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:06.155
MEASURE OF SPECIFICITY AND

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:08.491
BEFORE I GET. TEN THOUSAND PHONE

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:11.694
CALLS UP I SUPPORT THIS I REALLY

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:13.496
WANT THIS TO WORK BUT I STILL

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:14.697
THINK WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:16.332
DETAILS TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:18.201
WOULD WORK WHO WOULD COVER

01:02:18.267 --> 01:02:20.103
WHETHER THE OUT YEARS COVERED

01:02:20.169 --> 01:02:22.305
WHETHER WE PROP THIS MONEY AND

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:24.006
IT TURNS OUT IT'S MUCH MORE THAN

01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:25.641
WE NEED OR MUCH LESS THAN WE

01:02:25.708 --> 01:02:27.810
NEED. AND I JUST THINK THOSE ARE

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:28.344
STILL QUESTIONS THAT ARE

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:30.446
UNANSWERED AND I HOPE WE CAN GET

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:32.281
TO THEM LET ME ASK MY COLLEAGUES

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:34.016
IF THERE'S QUESTIONS IN AND

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:36.219
DECIDE ON. WHAT I'M SORRY WHAT

01:02:36.285 --> 01:02:39.522
WE HAVE A HAND FROM FINANCE WHO

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:43.526
MIGHT WANT TO. THAN ANY ON. SO

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.495
IT DID YOU ON HAND BECAUSE YOU

01:02:45.561 --> 01:02:47.363
WANT ME TO RECOGNIZE YOU AND

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:48.965
THEN. THEN HEY YEAH I WAS JUST

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:50.566
GOING TO QUICKLY SAY THAT AGAIN

01:02:50.633 --> 01:02:51.701
THIS THAT THE JUSTICE BUT

01:02:51.767 --> 01:02:52.735
VIOLENCE TWO HUNDRED MILLION

01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:54.537
WHEN I FEATURED IN A TIME

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:55.838
PROGRAM THIS WOULD JUST BE TWO

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:57.707
HUNDRED MILLION TO AUGMENT THE

01:02:57.773 --> 01:02:58.441
CURRENT AMOUNT OF FUNDING SO.

01:02:58.508 --> 01:02:59.709
UNDERSTANDINGS OF THAT THIS TWO

01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:00.576
HUNDRED MILLION WOULD GO TOWARDS

01:03:00.643 --> 01:03:02.011
PROVIDING A STRONG INCENTIVE

01:03:02.078 --> 01:03:04.147
BUT- WE WOULD NEED TO REVISIT

01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:05.014
THE QUESTION OF FUTURAMA. AND I

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:06.415
THINK THAT DESERVES A MEASURE

01:03:06.482 --> 01:03:08.184
THAT'S DISAPPOINTING AND ONE WAY

01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:09.886
BECAUSE I THINK IN FEBRUARY WE

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:11.287
SAID WE DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THE

01:03:11.354 --> 01:03:12.455
WAY THE CURRENT PROGRAM WAS

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:14.123
STRUCTURED SO NOW THE DETAIL

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:16.259
COMES IN FOUR MONTHS LATER. AND

01:03:16.325 --> 01:03:17.326
IT BASICALLY PROPS UP THE

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:20.496
PROGRAM THAT THAT MIGHT NOT WORK

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:22.698
VERY WELL SO BOB. I JUST

01:03:22.765 --> 01:03:25.001

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:27.603
JUST HOPE WE CAN GET AT THIS IN

THE NEXT FEW WEEKS TO MY

01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:32.508

01:54:53.119 --> 01:54:54.821
GET DISCUSSED BEFORE THIS BUDGET

01:54:54.887 --> 01:54:56.422

TO BE CONNECTED WE KNOW THIS

01:55:09.602 --> 01:55:11.170
BECAUSE OUR SCHOOLS PROVIDED

02:06:50.436 --> 02:06:52.571
SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE ONE WAY THE

02:06:54.473 --> 02:06:55.574

02:07:16.762 --> 02:07:18.364
THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

02:07:18.430 --> 02:07:19.898

02:07:37.116 --> 02:07:39.318
EVERY FROM I ENCOURAGING-

02:07:39.385 --> 02:07:42.187
PROJECT. MAINTAINING STAFFING

02:07:42.254 --> 02:07:43.622
LEVELS TOO COINCIDENTAL HEALTH.

02:07:43.689 --> 02:07:45.557
AS FAR AS THE ONGOING INCREASES

02:07:45.624 --> 02:07:46.959
MOST OF THE NEW FUNDING IS FOR

02:07:47.026 --> 02:07:48.260
THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

02:07:48.327 --> 02:07:49.528
FORMULA. THIS IS PROBABLY THE

02:07:49.595 --> 02:07:50.829
MOST COMPLICATED ASPECT OF THE

02:07:50.896 --> 02:07:52.431
KICKOFF PACKAGE BECAUSE IT HAS

02:07:52.498 --> 02:07:54.400
SO MANY MOVING PIECES. BUT I

02:07:54.466 --> 02:07:56.268
THINK THE WAY TO STAY ORIENTED

02:07:56.335 --> 02:07:58.070
IS THE FOCUS ON THE TOP LINE

02:07:58.137 --> 02:07:58.737
NUMBER IS. UNDER THE NAY

02:07:58.804 --> 02:08:00.372
REVISION THE TOTAL FUNDING FOR

02:08:00.439 --> 02:08:01.807
LCS PATH WOULD INCREASE ABOUT

02:08:01.874 --> 02:08:03.909
SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION MARKET

02:08:03.976 --> 02:08:04.943
BY DID THIS YEAR TO TWENTY TWO

02:08:05.010 --> 02:08:06.612
TWENTY THREE. AND THAT'S A TOTAL

02:08:06.678 --> 02:08:07.780
INCREASE ABOUT TWO POINT NINE

02:08:07.846 --> 02:08:09.381
BILLION COMPARED WITH THE

02:08:09.448 --> 02:08:11.817
JANUARY PROPOSAL. AND THAT'S THE

02:08:11.884 --> 02:08:13.852
RESULT OF. A FERMENTED JUST

02:08:13.919 --> 02:08:15.087
MEANS THE LOWER BASEMENT

02:08:15.154 --> 02:08:17.156
ATTENDANCE AT THE- GOVERNOR'S

02:08:17.222 --> 02:08:19.024
NEW ATTENDANCE- HOLD HARMLESS

02:08:19.091 --> 02:08:20.859
PROPOSAL. THE INCREASE IN THE

02:08:20.926 --> 02:08:22.361
STATUTORY COLA IN THE

02:08:22.428 --> 02:08:23.896
DISAMBIGUATE BAYSIDE MEDITATION

02:08:23.962 --> 02:08:25.731
ON TOP OF THAT AMOUNT. WHICH WE

02:08:25.798 --> 02:08:29.802
ESTIMATE. AT ROUGHLY THREE POINT

02:08:29.868 --> 02:08:31.470
2% AND IT'S ALL A SPECIAL NINETY

02:08:31.537 --> 02:08:33.539
FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION-

02:08:33.605 --> 02:08:35.374
WE ESTIMATE THAT PROPOSAL WOULD

02:08:35.441 --> 02:08:37.643
INCREASE. FUNDING WITH A 15% ON

02:08:37.709 --> 02:08:39.445
AVERAGE THE EXACT AMOUNT WOULD

02:08:39.511 --> 02:08:41.046
VARY A BIT FROM COUNTY TO

02:08:41.113 --> 02:08:41.847
COUNTY. SOME COUNTIES WILL

02:08:41.914 --> 02:08:43.115
RECEIVE INCREASES EVEN THOUGH

02:08:43.182 --> 02:08:44.616
THEIR EXISTING FUNDING ALREADY

02:08:44.683 --> 02:08:47.052
EXCEEDS THEIR TARGETS. UNDER THE

02:08:47.119 --> 02:08:49.488
FORMULA. THAT'S A TURNING TO OUR

02:08:49.555 --> 02:08:52.357
COMMENTS DECIDES ON- AJ IF

02:08:52.424 --> 02:08:54.059
YOU'RE LOOKING AT OUR HAND OUT.

02:08:54.126 --> 02:08:55.928
THIS IS THE LARGEST VISION

02:08:55.994 --> 02:08:58.464
PACKAGE SINCE THE ADOPTION OF

02:08:58.530 --> 02:08:59.665
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. NEARLY

02:08:59.731 --> 02:09:01.500
THREE BILLION LARGER THAN THE

02:09:01.567 --> 02:09:02.534
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO MAY

02:09:02.601 --> 02:09:03.535
REVISION JUST THE PREVIOUS ALL

02:09:03.602 --> 02:09:06.038
TIME HIGH. BUT WE THINK ONE OF

02:09:06.105 --> 02:09:07.739
THE POSITIVE FEATURES IS THAT IT

02:09:07.806 --> 02:09:09.675
ALSO HAS. AND IF YOU AS AND HELP

02:09:09.741 --> 02:09:11.009
TO BUILD BUDGET RESILIENCY AND

02:09:11.076 --> 02:09:12.244
WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT GIVEN

02:09:12.311 --> 02:09:13.946
SOME OF THE ECONOMIC WARNING

02:09:14.012 --> 02:09:15.013
SIGNS THAT MY COLLEAGUE

02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:20.686
MENTIONED. AND HIGHER. BILLION

02:09:20.752 --> 02:09:22.821
IN I'M GOING TO K. TWELVE FUNDS

02:09:22.888 --> 02:09:23.856
THAT ARE ALLOCATED TO ONE TIME

02:09:23.922 --> 02:09:26.125
ACTIVITIES. THERE'S NOTHING.

02:09:26.191 --> 02:09:27.826
UNIQUE ABOUT THAT NUMBER. THE

02:09:27.893 --> 02:09:28.961
FINAL BUDGET COULD CERTAINLY GO

02:09:29.027 --> 02:09:30.896
HIGHER LOOK LITTLE HIGHER LOWER

02:09:30.963 --> 02:09:33.332
THAN THAT. BUT IT GIVES YOU A

02:09:33.398 --> 02:09:33.932
SIGNIFICANT QUESTION TO DEAL

02:09:33.999 --> 02:09:35.467
WITH THE POTENTIAL DOWNTURN.

02:09:35.534 --> 02:09:36.969
PROPOSITION NINETY RESERVE ALSO

02:09:37.035 --> 02:09:38.971
GROSSED NINE POINT FIVE BILLION.

02:09:39.037 --> 02:09:41.240
NEARLY 9% OF THE MINIMUM

02:09:41.306 --> 02:09:42.407
GUARANTEE IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY

02:09:42.474 --> 02:09:44.676
THREE. NOT HUGE IN THAT CONTEXT

02:09:44.743 --> 02:09:47.613
BUT A VERY HELPFUL STARTING

02:09:47.679 --> 02:09:48.947
POINT FOR MANAGING VOLATILITY.

02:09:49.014 --> 02:09:51.016
ON THE LCF WE THINK MOST OF THE

02:09:51.083 --> 02:09:52.518
PROPOSALS ARE REASONABLE.

02:09:52.584 --> 02:09:54.186
PROVIDING AN AUGMENTATION BEYOND

02:09:54.253 --> 02:09:56.121
THE COLOR COULD ALLOW DISTRICTS

02:09:56.188 --> 02:09:58.524
TO SUSTAIN PROGRAMS EXPANSIONS

02:09:58.590 --> 02:09:59.725
MISTAKES OF SEVERAL COST

02:09:59.791 --> 02:10:01.527
PRESSURES. RANGING FROM HIGHER

02:10:01.593 --> 02:10:03.362
INFLATION HIGHER PENSION COSTS.

02:10:03.428 --> 02:10:05.030
WE ALSO THANK THE PROPOSED

02:10:05.097 --> 02:10:06.098
ATTENDANCE ADJUSTMENTS ARE

02:10:06.165 --> 02:10:07.065
REASONABLE BECAUSE THEY WOULD

02:10:07.132 --> 02:10:09.301
MITIGATE. THE TEMPORARY DROPS TO

02:10:09.368 --> 02:10:10.802
THE PANDEMIC WHILE STILL

02:10:10.869 --> 02:10:11.937
MAINTAINING THE CONNECTION

02:10:12.004 --> 02:10:15.107
BETWEEN STUDENTS AND FUNDING

02:10:15.174 --> 02:10:16.475
OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. WE

02:10:16.542 --> 02:10:18.010
DO HAVE SOME NOTABLE CONCERNS

02:10:18.076 --> 02:10:19.077
WITH THE PROPOSAL FOR COUNTY

02:10:19.144 --> 02:10:20.779
OFFICES OF EDUCATION. THE MAY

02:10:20.846 --> 02:10:21.880
REVISION WOULD INCREASE FUNDING

02:10:21.947 --> 02:10:24.183
AT A FASTER PACE THAN FOR

02:10:24.249 --> 02:10:24.816
DISTRICTS WITHOUT A COMPELLING

02:10:24.883 --> 02:10:26.718
RATIONALE AND WE'RE CONCERNED

02:10:26.785 --> 02:10:27.786
THAT IT WOULD MAKE THE FISA OF

02:10:27.853 --> 02:10:29.121
THE HISTORICAL FUNDING

02:10:29.188 --> 02:10:29.621
INEQUITIES THE STATE HAS

02:10:29.688 --> 02:10:31.356
ATTEMPTED TO EVEN OUT OVER THE

02:10:31.423 --> 02:10:32.658
PAST SEVERAL YEARS. WERECOMMEND

02:10:32.724 --> 02:10:34.193
YOU REJECT THAT PROPOSAL AND

02:10:34.259 --> 02:10:35.661
INSTEAD TAKE A LESS COSTLY

02:10:35.727 --> 02:10:38.530
APPROACH THAT'S CLOSER TO WHAT'S

02:10:38.597 --> 02:10:39.565
BEING PROPOSED FOR SCHOOL

02:10:39.631 --> 02:10:40.966
DISTRICTS. ON THE DISCRETIONARY

02:10:41.033 --> 02:10:42.801
GRANT TO THINK THIS IS AN IDEA

02:10:42.868 --> 02:10:44.002
SOME MERITS. WOULD HELP SCHOOLS

02:10:44.069 --> 02:10:44.937
ADDRESS THEIR HIGHEST ONE TIME

02:10:45.003 --> 02:10:46.538
PRIORITIES AND COMPLIMENTS OF

02:10:46.605 --> 02:10:48.440
OTHER PROPOSALS IN THE BUDGET.

02:10:48.507 --> 02:10:49.675
AND YOUR PRIORITIES YOU CAN

02:10:49.741 --> 02:10:50.876
TAILOR THE PROPOSAL IN A COUPLE

02:10:50.943 --> 02:10:53.345
WAYS YOU COULD JUST THE INTENT

02:10:53.412 --> 02:10:54.213
LANGUAGE. FOR EXAMPLE MAYBE WANT

02:10:54.279 --> 02:10:55.314
TO ENCOURAGE DISTRICTS TO FOCUS

02:10:55.380 --> 02:10:57.449
MORE ON PANDEMIC RECOVERY OR

02:10:57.516 --> 02:10:59.251
DRESSING LOCAL DEBTS AND

02:10:59.318 --> 02:11:00.786
LIABILITIES. YOU CAN ADJUST THE

02:11:00.852 --> 02:11:01.553
AMOUNT. THERE'S SOMETHING MORE

02:11:01.620 --> 02:11:02.721
ALONG THE LINES OF THE SENATE

02:11:02.788 --> 02:11:05.791
DEMOCRATS PLAN OR- OTHER THINGS

02:11:05.857 --> 02:11:07.059
THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO FIND IN

02:11:07.125 --> 02:11:09.228
THIS- IN THE FINAL BUDGET. YOU

02:11:09.294 --> 02:11:10.929
CAN EVEN ADJUST THE PAYMENT

02:11:10.996 --> 02:11:12.130
SCHEDULE YOU WANT DISTRICTS TO

02:11:12.197 --> 02:11:13.632
USE THOSE FUNDS TO SUPPORT

02:11:13.699 --> 02:11:14.866
PROGRAMS OVER A PERIOD OF

02:11:14.933 --> 02:11:18.203
SEVERAL YEARS. YOU CAN DISPERSE

02:11:18.270 --> 02:11:19.171
FUNDS ACCORDING TO THAT TIME ON.

02:11:19.238 --> 02:11:20.706
WE HAVE A CONCERNS WITH A FEW

02:11:20.772 --> 02:11:21.907
SPECIFIC PROPOSALS IN THE NAY

02:11:21.974 --> 02:11:23.875
REVISION- DOES INVOLVE SOME OF

02:11:23.942 --> 02:11:25.177
THE TEACHER TRAINING INITIATIVES

02:11:25.244 --> 02:11:26.545
AS WELL AS THE RIGHT TO MUSIC

02:11:26.612 --> 02:11:28.113
SET ASIDE WITHIN THE EXPANDED

02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:29.448
LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAMS.

02:11:29.514 --> 02:11:30.749
OKAY MORE ABOUT SOME OF THOSE

02:11:30.816 --> 02:11:32.618
ISSUES THE NEXT PANEL. BUT THE

02:11:32.684 --> 02:11:33.885
FUNDING FOR SOME OF THOSE

02:11:33.952 --> 02:11:35.053
PROPOSAL SEEMS PREMATURE GIVEN

02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:35.988
ALL THE FUNDING THAT'S ALREADY

02:11:36.054 --> 02:11:37.389
BEEN MADE AVAILABLE. EITHER IN

02:11:37.456 --> 02:11:39.625
THE JANUARY BUDGET OR IN

02:11:39.691 --> 02:11:41.727
PREVIOUS BUDGETS. AND LASTLY WE

02:11:41.793 --> 02:11:43.028
RECOMMEND YOU EXPLORE THE

02:11:43.095 --> 02:11:44.129
POSSIBILITY OF PROVIDING MORE

02:11:44.196 --> 02:11:45.497
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING

02:11:45.564 --> 02:11:47.566
FOR FACILITIES. AND WEIGHING

02:11:47.633 --> 02:11:49.701
THAT OPTION WE DRAW YOUR

02:11:49.768 --> 02:11:50.869
ATTENTION TO A FEW

02:11:50.936 --> 02:11:52.304
CONSIDERATIONS. ONE IS THAT THE

02:11:52.371 --> 02:11:53.839
STATE HAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

02:11:53.905 --> 02:11:55.340
OF FUNDING AVAILABLE THAT'S-

02:11:55.407 --> 02:11:57.309
ONLY AVAILABLE ON A ONE TIME

02:11:57.376 --> 02:11:59.111
BASIS. I USING THAT FUNDING FOR

02:11:59.177 --> 02:12:00.479
FACILITIES TO PROVIDE BENEFITS

02:12:00.545 --> 02:12:01.847
THAT WOULD LAST FOR MANY YEARS.

02:12:01.913 --> 02:12:03.482
I WE ALSO THINK THERE ARE SOME

02:12:03.548 --> 02:12:05.384
PROMISING OPTIONS RIGHT NOW. ONE

02:12:05.450 --> 02:12:06.785
COULD BE HELPING DISTRICTS

02:12:06.852 --> 02:12:07.486
OBTAIN THE DISABILITIES THEY

02:12:07.552 --> 02:12:08.754
NEED TO EXPANSION JUST NOT

02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:10.289
KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS. WE

02:12:10.355 --> 02:12:12.224
UNDERSTAND THAT THE KEY. IS

02:12:12.291 --> 02:12:13.392
ALREADY THERE KEY CHALLENGE FOR

02:12:13.458 --> 02:12:14.760
DISTRICTS AS THEY GEAR UP THE

02:12:14.826 --> 02:12:17.329
EXPANSION. ANOTHER OPTION COULD

02:12:17.396 --> 02:12:18.964
BE PROVIDING MORE FUNDING FOR

02:12:19.031 --> 02:12:19.498
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. THE

02:12:19.564 --> 02:12:20.732
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR ONE

02:12:20.799 --> 02:12:22.567
POINT EIGHT BILLION IS A GOOD

02:12:22.634 --> 02:12:23.468
DOWN PAYMENT BUT WE THINK THE

02:12:23.535 --> 02:12:25.637
BACKLOG IS EVEN LARGER. AND I

02:12:25.704 --> 02:12:27.039
COULD EVEN ACCELERATE ONE OF THE

02:12:27.105 --> 02:12:29.107
KICKOFF PARTY IS LAID OUT. IN

02:12:29.174 --> 02:12:32.244
THE SENATE DEMOCRATS PLAN A FEW

02:12:32.311 --> 02:12:33.645
WEEKS AGO. OR THE STATE COULD

02:12:33.712 --> 02:12:35.847
THINK A ONE TO AND STUFF PAYMENT

02:12:35.914 --> 02:12:37.049
TO THE SCHOOL FOR. PROGRAM IN

02:12:37.115 --> 02:12:38.250
THAT COULD HELP ADDRESS OF THE

02:12:38.317 --> 02:12:39.451
BACK. IN DEMAND FOR. MAJOR

02:12:39.518 --> 02:12:40.986
CONSTRUCTION RENOVATION. THE

02:12:41.053 --> 02:12:42.354
ADDITIONAL FUNDING COULD

02:12:42.421 --> 02:12:43.722
QUALIFIES EXCLUDABLE CAPITAL

02:12:43.789 --> 02:12:45.023
OUTLAY THE APPROPRIATIONS

02:12:45.090 --> 02:12:47.392
LIMITS. AND THAT WOULD EASE SOME

02:12:47.459 --> 02:12:49.494
OF THE PRESSURE ON THE OVERALL

02:12:49.561 --> 02:12:50.395
STATE BUDGET. AND LASTLY IT

02:12:50.462 --> 02:12:51.963
WOULDN'T HAVE TO COMPETE WITH

02:12:52.030 --> 02:12:54.266
ANY OF YOUR ONGOING PRIORITY IS

02:12:54.333 --> 02:12:55.167
. THAT COULD BE DONE ENTIRELY

02:12:55.233 --> 02:12:56.468
WITH RE PURPOSING SOME OF THE

02:12:56.535 --> 02:12:59.237
ONE TIME FUNDS. FUNDS THAT ARE

02:12:59.304 --> 02:13:00.505
ONLY AVAILABLE FOR ONE TIME

02:13:00.572 --> 02:13:01.640
ACTIVITIES. US WITHOUT A

02:13:01.707 --> 02:13:02.607
COMPLETE MY COMMENTS AND MY

02:13:02.674 --> 02:13:03.575
COLLEAGUES IN THE SUBSEQUENT

02:13:03.642 --> 02:13:06.078
PANELSWILL COVER THROUGH THE

02:13:06.144 --> 02:13:07.212
OTHER PROPOSALS. THANK YOU VERY

02:13:07.279 --> 02:13:09.548
MUCH- I HAVE A COUPLE OF

02:13:09.614 --> 02:13:11.650
QUESTIONS AND THEN I'LL CHECK

02:13:11.717 --> 02:13:13.085
WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THE

02:13:13.151 --> 02:13:15.520
OVERVIEW AND ONE OF THEM IS IT

02:13:15.587 --> 02:13:17.122
THEY'RE BOTH A FOR THE

02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:19.091
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE

02:13:19.157 --> 02:13:21.360
FIRST ONE- HI ASK PREVIOUSLY IN

02:13:21.426 --> 02:13:23.195
ANOTHER SEGMENT BUT IT'S A

02:13:23.261 --> 02:13:24.930
QUESTION ABOUT DISADVANTAGED

02:13:24.996 --> 02:13:28.300
STUDENTS AND- STUDIES SHOW THEY

02:13:28.367 --> 02:13:29.401
WERE MORE IMPACTED BY THE

02:13:29.468 --> 02:13:32.304
PANDEMIC SO HOW DO THEY BENEFIT

02:13:32.371 --> 02:13:33.605
FROM THE EXTRA DOLLARS THAT ARE

02:13:33.672 --> 02:13:35.440
BEING RECOMMENDED HERE. HOW DO

MAINTENANCE BACKLOG THAT LIKELY

02:31:33.717 --> 02:31:35.419
A KEY. DURING THE LAST RECESSION

CONSIDER PROVIDING MORE FUNDING

THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO

02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:50.601
CONSIDER ALLOCATING FUNDING

BASED ON TAXABLE PROPERTY VALUE

02:31:53.304 --> 02:31:54.438

DUPLICATED PEOPLE COUNT. WE CAN

02:31:56.307 --> 02:31:57.708

DISTRICTS WITH LOWER TAXABLE

02:32:02.146 --> 02:32:03.314
PROPERTY VALUES ARE TYPICALLY

02:32:03.380 --> 02:32:05.149
MORE CONSTRAINED IN OUR ABILITY

02:32:05.216 --> 02:32:06.350

02:32:43.587 --> 02:32:45.756
HOPE OF SOME OF US THAT AT SOME

02:32:45.823 --> 02:32:49.326
POINT THERE WOULD BE A BOND FOR-

SCHOOL CAN. OUR BEST ESTIMATES

02:34:21.852 --> 02:34:22.786
RIGHT NOW ARE THAT THE FUNDING

02:34:22.853 --> 02:34:25.155
SHOULD LAST US THROUGH THE END

02:34:25.222 --> 02:34:27.725
OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AFTER

02:34:27.791 --> 02:34:29.226
THAT THAT OFFERS US SOME

02:34:29.293 --> 02:34:31.295
PERSPECTIVE ON THE POTENTIAL

02:34:31.362 --> 02:34:33.831
YEARS THAT WE MIGHT. OUR GO TO

02:34:33.897 --> 02:34:35.599
THE VOTERS WITH THE BOND BUT

02:34:35.666 --> 02:34:38.002
FROM. WHAT WHAT THAT WILL JUST

02:34:38.068 --> 02:34:39.970
BE ANOTHER ITEM FOR DISCUSSION

02:34:40.037 --> 02:34:41.372
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GROUND

02:34:41.438 --> 02:34:43.073

02:34:43.140 --> 02:34:45.476
INTO THE FINALIZATION OF THE

02:34:45.542 --> 02:34:47.578

02:34:47.645 --> 02:34:50.614
QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES ON

02:34:50.681 --> 02:34:55.452
ISSUE FOR. SENATOR MADE. I JUST

02:34:55.519 --> 02:34:58.489
WANTED TO NOTE THAT- THE STATE

02:34:58.555 --> 02:35:00.457
SENATE'S VOTE BUDGET PLAN

02:35:00.524 --> 02:35:03.694
INCLUDES- ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR

02:35:03.761 --> 02:35:07.064
I. T. K. FACILITIES AND I THINK

02:35:07.131 --> 02:35:07.631
IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE

02:35:07.698 --> 02:35:09.667
BECAUSE- I'VE HEARD FROM A

02:35:09.733 --> 02:35:12.302
NUMBER OF SCHOOLS IN DELHI AS

02:35:12.369 --> 02:35:14.238
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS

02:35:14.304 --> 02:35:15.706
ARE THEY DON'T HAVE THE

02:35:15.773 --> 02:35:16.440
FACILITIES IN PLACE AND IT

02:35:16.507 --> 02:35:18.842
LACKED THE FUNDING. TO TRY TO

02:35:18.909 --> 02:35:20.244
IMPLEMENT THE GOVERNOR'S

02:35:20.310 --> 02:35:21.679
AMBITIOUS UNIVERSAL T. K.

02:35:21.745 --> 02:35:24.682

SCHOOLS TO. DO THIS WEEK WE HAVE

02:35:26.717 --> 02:35:28.352
TO PROVIDE FUNDING I THINK THIS

02:35:28.419 --> 02:35:30.020
IS APPROPRIATE SO I WOULD URGE

02:35:30.087 --> 02:35:31.588
THAT THIS- PARTICULAR FUNDING

02:35:31.655 --> 02:35:33.657
INVESTMENT- BE KEPT IN. WHAT ARE

02:35:33.724 --> 02:35:36.827
THE FINAL OUTCOMES ARE. FROM THE

02:35:36.894 --> 02:35:38.829

02:35:46.403 --> 02:35:48.772
FACILITIES AND STAFF ARE BEING

02:35:48.839 --> 02:35:51.975
ISSUES FOR. THIRTY K. PRE K. AND

02:35:52.042 --> 02:35:53.644
THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL ALSO DOES

02:35:53.711 --> 02:35:55.345
SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK IS

02:35:55.412 --> 02:35:56.947
DONE IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S

02:35:57.014 --> 02:35:59.183
PROPOSAL ON THAT IS THAT. A

02:35:59.249 --> 02:36:01.351
BASIC AID SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ARE

02:36:01.418 --> 02:36:03.954

A WAY OF ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE.

02:36:20.971 --> 02:36:22.439
AND I THINK THAT'S TRUE WITH THE

02:36:22.506 --> 02:36:24.241
BLOCK GRANT FUNDS AT THE SENATE

02:36:24.308 --> 02:36:26.143

02:36:47.131 --> 02:36:49.099
WEALTHY AND SUBSTANTIALLY OVER

02:36:49.166 --> 02:36:52.236

TRULY LOOKINTO HAVING MAKE

02:56:48.564 --> 02:56:50.032
PERHAPS MORE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE

02:56:50.099 --> 02:56:53.235
THAT WE CAN. CLEARLY IDENTIFY AS

02:56:53.302 --> 02:56:56.505
A SOURCE FOR FUNDING FOR-

02:56:56.572 --> 02:56:58.007
PRESCHOOL PARENT PARTICIPATION

02:56:58.074 --> 02:56:59.342
WE HAVE A LOT OF DELIVERIES AND

02:56:59.408 --> 02:57:00.643
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

02:57:00.710 --> 02:57:02.211
IMPORTANCE OF HAVING IT MAKES

02:57:02.278 --> 02:57:03.512
DELIVERY ON THAT BUT I HAVEN'T

02:57:03.579 --> 02:57:07.049
YET SEEN ONE THAT SPECIFICALLY-

02:57:07.116 --> 02:57:09.952
DIRECTS OR ALLOWS FOR PARENTS TO

02:57:10.019 --> 02:57:11.554
BE IN THE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND

02:57:11.620 --> 02:57:13.022
WE I KNOW WE'VE HAD. SEVERAL

02:57:13.089 --> 02:57:14.290
THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT HAVE

02:57:14.357 --> 02:57:15.925
BEEN INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE

02:57:15.992 --> 02:57:18.127
INCLUDING HERE IN IN SACRAMENTO

02:57:18.194 --> 02:57:19.061
AND PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:57:19.128 --> 02:57:21.030
EXISTENCE HAVE EXISTED AT THE

02:57:21.097 --> 02:57:22.465
SUCCESSFUL BUT YET WE HAVEN'T

02:57:22.531 --> 02:57:25.001
HAD IT- DIRECT FUNDING FOR IT

02:57:25.067 --> 02:57:26.435
AND WE'VE HAD WE'VE LOST SOME OF

02:57:26.502 --> 02:57:27.603
THOSE PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE

02:57:27.670 --> 02:57:29.805
STATESO I WOULD. HIGHLY

02:57:29.872 --> 02:57:31.774
RECOMMEND THAT WE EAT WE EAT.

02:57:31.841 --> 02:57:32.475
TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF

02:57:32.541 --> 02:57:35.011
RESPONSIBILITY AND- DIRECTORS

02:57:35.077 --> 02:57:36.278
FUNDING FOR THESE APPROACH

02:57:36.345 --> 02:57:37.279
BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE

02:57:37.346 --> 02:57:40.182
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL- IN THAT.

02:57:40.249 --> 02:57:41.984
AND THEN ANOTHER SUGGESTION THAT

02:57:42.051 --> 02:57:43.552
I WANT TO TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:57:43.619 --> 02:57:45.721
JUST KIND OF HIGHLIGHT. I'M

02:57:45.788 --> 02:57:47.757

STUDENTS TEACH READING AND SO

02:57:58.801 --> 02:58:01.337
FORTH ANOTHER FLEXIBILITY. IN IN

02:58:01.404 --> 02:58:04.473
THESE PROGRAMS BUT SOMETHING.

02:58:04.540 --> 02:58:05.775
HAPPENED THAT COULD- DIRECT

02:58:05.841 --> 02:58:07.810
FUNDING FOR THESE TYPES OF

02:58:07.877 --> 02:58:08.778
PROGRAMS- SOMETHING TO CONSIDER

02:58:08.844 --> 02:58:10.746
AND JUST PUNTING THE SEED HERE

02:58:10.813 --> 02:58:12.915
IS TO ALLOW LANGUAGE SUCH AS

02:58:12.982 --> 02:58:15.017

FLEXIBILITY AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS

02:58:26.662 --> 02:58:27.963
BUT I THINK HAVING DIRECT

02:58:28.030 --> 02:58:30.032
LANGUAGE SO WE CAN UTILIZE. AND

02:58:30.099 --> 02:58:31.734
KIND OF PULL FROM SO WE CAN
